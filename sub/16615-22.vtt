00:01.067 --> 00:03.635
<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "once upon a time"...</i>

00:03.637 --> 00:04.770
Emma.
You have a visitor.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.105
You have to stop
doing that

00:06.107 --> 00:07.973
or your mother's not gonna let
you keep visiting me.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.175
Henry.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.977
There's my boy.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.146
Regina: If we don't stop
the black fairy,

00:14.148 --> 00:17.816
all the realms will be destroyed
and everyone in them.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.385
Fiona:
There was an accident.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.453
Henry broke
into his doctor's office,

00:21.455 --> 00:23.188
had a nasty fall
down the stairs.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.690
I didn't fall.
She pushed me.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.892
How could I push him
if I wasn't even touching him?

00:26.894 --> 00:29.695
This is all my fault.
It has to stop.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.232
And you know
what you have to do.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.868
Go on. Burn it.

00:35.870 --> 00:40.005
Show him that you've
truly embraced reality.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.551
your father wouldn't
want you in tears.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.419
Not on his behalf.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.588
Tiger Lily.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.790
What happened here?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.292
Where is father?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.626
I don't know.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.030
But I do know
that it's clear

01:38.032 --> 01:40.599
he fought valiantly
so you could escape.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.301
I never should've left.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.802
I should've fought
with him!

01:43.804 --> 01:47.139
No. You were right
to follow his instructions.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.041
Because you did,

01:49.043 --> 01:50.809
the book is safe.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.078
We need to take it
to your mother now.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.046
She'll be waiting.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.050
But what about father?

01:58.052 --> 01:59.985
You'll be reunited one day.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.588
I promise.
The fairies have foreseen it.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.289
They have?

02:04.291 --> 02:06.959
W-we're going to be okay?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.665
the future is cloudy,

02:13.667 --> 02:16.502
but you will be reunited.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.804
After that...

02:23.810 --> 02:25.677
You just need to learn
the lesson

02:25.679 --> 02:26.945
imparted by this book.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.750
never lose hope.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.796
It -- it can't be.

02:44.798 --> 02:48.033
Well, I'm afraid it is.
Your story book.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.002
Or what's left of it.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.871
No way.
My mom would never burn it.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.439
Oh, but she did.

02:54.441 --> 02:58.177
Whatever last bit of belief
she clung to went up in smoke,

02:58.179 --> 03:01.914
just like the pages
of your precious book.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.651
Not even you could destroy
her belief completely.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.187
If that's so, then why is
she packing for Boston

03:08.189 --> 03:09.888
at this very moment?

03:11.658 --> 03:12.858
I'll stop you.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.493
Oh, haven't you
already tried that?

03:14.495 --> 03:15.561
Look where it got you.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.728
It's not just me.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.964
It's my family.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.866
We won't let you win.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.068
Oh, haven't I mentioned
the consequences

03:23.070 --> 03:24.236
of Emma's lost belief?

03:26.372 --> 03:28.040
Your family
isn't going to exist

03:28.042 --> 03:31.143
long enough
to save themselves,

03:31.145 --> 03:33.478
let alone your mother.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.098
Hurry, mate!

03:53.100 --> 03:54.800
Yeah, I know!

03:56.669 --> 03:57.669
Aah!

03:57.671 --> 03:58.904
Hook!

03:58.906 --> 04:01.073
Aah!

04:09.215 --> 04:12.017
Hoooook!

04:18.925 --> 04:20.759
Aah!

04:23.396 --> 04:25.097
Charming.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.198
Something's wrong.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.867
Where?
I'll get us there.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.636
I don't know.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.306
Then let's go
find him.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.911
Snow: David!

04:39.913 --> 04:40.946
David?!

04:41.982 --> 04:42.914
David!

04:42.916 --> 04:46.051
David!

04:49.222 --> 04:50.622
Hello there, mummy.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.823
"Mummy?"

04:51.825 --> 04:54.159
Oh, there was a --
there was a wedding.

04:54.161 --> 04:57.829
And yeah, that is still going to
take some getting used to.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.433
Uh, what happened?

05:01.435 --> 05:03.135
Well, first, I fell,

05:03.137 --> 05:04.936
and then --
and then it fell,

05:04.938 --> 05:07.205
but we managed to get this.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.574
Great!

05:09.576 --> 05:12.177
Where's David?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.881
You mean he's not here?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.418
David?!

05:19.420 --> 05:20.919
-He was on that?
-David?!

05:20.921 --> 05:22.454
We should start searching.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.523
This beanstalk
goes on for miles.
No, you're getting back
to the castle.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.924
Take the bean.
Get to Emma and Henry.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.459
Don't worry about David.
I'll find him.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.927
The realms
are disappearing.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.195
We don't have much time.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.830
Get to Emma.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.998
It's important.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.268
Make her believe again.

05:39.138 --> 05:40.972
So it's true.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.674
You're really leaving
storybrooke.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.576
It's what's best
for both of us, kid.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.947
Don't you get it?

05:48.949 --> 05:50.048
This is
what she wants.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.516
The black fairy
cast the curse

05:51.518 --> 05:52.951
so all this
would get you to leave.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.219
This is why I have to go,

05:54.221 --> 05:56.655
because you still believe
this nonsense is true.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.357
-It is.
-Henry, stop.

05:59.325 --> 06:02.661
Don't get me wrong.
I am so happy you found me.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.664
And I'm so happy
i got to know my son.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.299
But it's so clear now.

06:07.301 --> 06:10.068
Coming to storybrooke wasn't
good for either of us.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.903
You're wrong.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.372
Look where I ended up.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.973
Look at you.
Look at your arm.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.743
It sent us
on a dangerous path.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.178
I got to get back to Boston
and back to my life.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.414
And so do you.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.617
She did it.

06:26.986 --> 06:28.387
You really don't believe?

06:28.389 --> 06:30.722
There's nothing to believe.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.993
Goodbye, kid.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.365
I love you.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.761
Henry: <i> You might not think</i>
<i> this story's true.</i>

07:42.763 --> 07:44.396
<i> But I know that it is.</i>

07:44.398 --> 07:47.065
<i> And it can still</i>
<i> have a happy ending.</i>

07:51.238 --> 07:52.304
Hello?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.406
Man: Hey, swan,
i got your message.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.007
-You back?
-Yeah, I'm back.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.109
Great.
Ready to go to work?

07:58.111 --> 08:00.078
'Cause I got a guy
who jumped bail --

08:00.080 --> 08:03.014
a perfect mark for
your "first date" trick.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.483
What do you say?

08:04.485 --> 08:05.917
Sounds good.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.985
And you left snow
behind?

08:39.986 --> 08:42.486
But I have the bean.
And that's the priority --

08:42.489 --> 08:44.356
getting back home
to Emma, to Henry.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.191
She'll find David.
She always does.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.462
Well, we have a problem.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.130
What the devil
happened to it?

08:52.132 --> 08:53.965
Emma.
Her lack of belief.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.468
It's sapping the magic
from everything here.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.169
Well, can't you fix it?
Make it work?

08:58.171 --> 09:01.806
Well, I can't. I'm --
i don't...Have enough power.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.376
Of course you do, sis.

09:04.378 --> 09:09.214
With a little help
from, well, yourself.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.750
The evil queen.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.051
Your evil half is here?

09:13.053 --> 09:15.487
Well, she's not evil.
Not completely.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.555
And yes, she's here.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.656
And you trust here?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.658
Well, of course I do.
She's me.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.760
And remember,
Henry's her son, too.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.937
David!

09:37.544 --> 09:39.244
David!

09:44.850 --> 09:46.084
No, no, no!

09:46.086 --> 09:47.085
No, no!

09:47.087 --> 09:49.287
Please, no!
Please, no!

09:56.228 --> 09:58.363
Please, no!

09:58.365 --> 10:00.165
No.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.433
You found me.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.803
Did you ever doubt
i would?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.973
Truthfully, the beanstalk
that fell on me gave me pause.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.112
Snow,
we're gonna be fine.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.613
Darkness never wins.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.750
It just fools you
into thinking it does.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.186
I love you, charming.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.724
I love you, snow.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.431
Let's go.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.537
Mr. gold?

11:12.539 --> 11:16.441
And where do you think
you're going to, young man?

11:16.443 --> 11:18.443
That room is off limits
to customers.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.445
I'm not a customer.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.880
I'm your grandson.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.314
Is that so?

11:23.316 --> 11:24.382
Yep.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.317
You must've hit your head
pretty badly.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.754
Now, if you don't mind,
i got work to do, so...Please.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.235
You're awake.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.971
I know what magic
looks like.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.140
What are you up to,
grandpa?

11:51.011 --> 11:54.546
clever under any circumstances,
aren't you, my boy?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.347
Why have you been
pretending?

11:56.349 --> 11:58.049
Because,
believe it or not,

11:58.051 --> 12:01.686
I didn't entirely trust my
mother when she cast the curse.

12:01.688 --> 12:04.923
And, as usual,
i was right not to.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.691
Our agreement wasn't
to put me

12:06.693 --> 12:09.394
in this pathetic circumstance
here without belle.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.831
She betrayed me.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.932
Again.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.667
What are you planning?

12:15.669 --> 12:18.203
To find out
her true intentions.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.706
She told me belle
was off to see the world,

12:21.708 --> 12:23.074
but I know better.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.444
She'd keep her here
for leverage, just in case.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.747
Well, belle's
gonna have to wait.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.349
Everyone back in the
enchanted forest is in danger

12:31.351 --> 12:34.085
because the black fairy made
Emma stop believing.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.720
You got to help me
save my family.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.088
<i> Our</i> family.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.556
And then we can find
belle.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.459
I'm sorry, Henry,
you're on your own.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.362
All I care about right now
is belle.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.865
Fine.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.399
But if you're not
gonna help,

12:48.401 --> 12:50.935
at least let me take something
that can help me.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.805
And what exactly
did you have in mind?

12:53.807 --> 12:56.241
Actually...

12:56.243 --> 12:57.942
There's two things.

13:07.453 --> 13:11.122
so, uh, I'm not sure
if any of you on the other side

13:11.124 --> 13:14.159
are listening,
but if you are, I'm sorry.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.162
I tried my best to keep Emma
from losing belief,

13:17.164 --> 13:18.963
but it wasn't good enough.

13:24.837 --> 13:28.006
But that doesn't mean I'm going
down without a fight.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.083
if Emma's not around
to take on the black fairy,

13:39.085 --> 13:41.019
then I will.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.355
Regina:
He's going alone.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.457
But how could he win
against her if Emma couldn't?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.026
He's a tough boy.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.228
Get that bean
working now.

13:51.697 --> 13:52.764
I'm sorry, Regina,

13:52.766 --> 13:54.532
but even with our magic
combined,

13:54.534 --> 13:55.934
it will still take time.

13:56.937 --> 13:56.935
We don't have time.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.104
It's on the outskirts of
the forest and moving fast.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.105
The magic's almost here.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.541
"Almost."

14:03.543 --> 14:05.844
I'm afraid that's a bit
of an understatement.

14:05.846 --> 14:06.945
It is here.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.447
Let's round everyone up,
get them to safety.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.562
What the hell
are you doing?

14:25.898 --> 14:27.999
I'm going to hold it off
as long as I can.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.200
You'll die!

14:29.202 --> 14:31.903
It'll give you a chance
to get to the courtyard.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.671
Go to the center
of the castle.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.674
You can survive long enough
there to get the bean to work.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.343
You just need time.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.178
Let me give that to you.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.980
Regina.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.085
Go.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.587
He's my son, too.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.157
He needs
at least one of us.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.853
everyone,
to the center, quickly!

15:21.855 --> 15:24.289
Close together!

16:39.098 --> 16:40.498
not so fast.

16:41.967 --> 16:43.434
You came back.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.136
Yeah. I did, kid.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.338
Does that mean you --
you remember?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.674
I...Found the book
you left.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.976
I was about to take
another job and...

16:51.978 --> 16:54.278
And then I thought about
this woman you wrote about

16:54.280 --> 16:55.780
who was a hero
with a family

16:55.782 --> 16:58.116
and a savior who never
ran from a battle and...

16:58.118 --> 16:59.283
You.

16:59.285 --> 17:04.021
Well, I'm not sure that it's me,
Henry, but, um...

17:04.023 --> 17:06.590
But it's who I want to be.

17:08.227 --> 17:12.063
So I don't remember all
the crazy stuff you told me,

17:12.065 --> 17:14.965
but...

17:14.968 --> 17:17.135
I believe it.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.285
What happened?

17:39.558 --> 17:42.160
Emma. She's back!

17:48.767 --> 17:52.070
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

18:13.058 --> 18:14.625
belle?

18:25.971 --> 18:27.438
Belle?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.041
I don't want to leave!
I don't want to leave!

18:30.043 --> 18:31.476
Please!

18:34.781 --> 18:35.780
Belle.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.082
How do you know my name?

18:38.084 --> 18:41.052
I can explain
if you give me a chance.

18:41.054 --> 18:43.154
Leave me alone, okay?
I'm safe here.

18:43.156 --> 18:46.791
Belle, I know this is
difficult to understand...

18:46.793 --> 18:49.594
But...

18:49.596 --> 18:51.729
You're not like this.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.631
The black fairy
did this to you.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.867
Changed you.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.670
I promise you,

18:59.672 --> 19:03.141
the woman who did this,

19:03.143 --> 19:06.077
I am gonna make her pay.

19:13.018 --> 19:14.252
Gideon: Madame mayor,
what's wrong?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.753
Are you here
to pick up your watch?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.822
No, I'm not here
for my watch.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.658
I'm here because
Emma swan is back.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.128
Uh, sorry.
I don't understand.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.763
Are you all right?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.431
Do you need something?

19:27.433 --> 19:29.500
Indeed I do.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.103
There's a fairy wand
in this shop.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.504
My fairy wand.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.140
And I need it back now.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.042
A fairy wand?

19:39.978 --> 19:42.046
Perhaps I should call
my father.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.015
He'll know what to do.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.285
Drop it! Now.

19:48.654 --> 19:51.622
The last thing I need
is gold getting involved.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.025
Why did I do that?

19:54.027 --> 19:56.194
I didn't want to do that.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.997
Despite what your father thinks,
i still have your heart.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.233
You have to do
whatever I say.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.702
So start looking
for that wand now.

20:08.507 --> 20:09.974
What is that?

20:09.976 --> 20:12.510
Regina: The runes
that Henry scribbled.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.079
It's an ancient language
long lost to time.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.148
I need the wand
to translate it.

20:18.350 --> 20:21.752
It holds the key
to winning the final battle.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.055
Is...

20:24.057 --> 20:27.058
This what you were
looking for?

20:29.761 --> 20:32.063
Yes.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.799
Yes, it is.

20:36.101 --> 20:39.070
It's been centuries
since I felt its power.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.486
Wonderful.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.457
Time to go to work, Gideon.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.048
Ah.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.085
Hello, Mr. gold.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.988
I was just here
to pick up my watch.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.926
No, you weren't...

21:35.928 --> 21:37.795
Mother.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.968
Of course.

21:43.970 --> 21:47.071
You know, I only
separated you from belle

21:47.073 --> 21:48.572
for your own good.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.641
She's my wife.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.976
And a terrible one.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.779
She would convince you to go
against your dark instincts.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.981
I couldn't let that happen.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.583
But once the final battle
is won,

21:59.585 --> 22:02.086
the curse on belle and Gideon
will be lifted,

22:02.088 --> 22:05.856
and I will have
unchecked powers.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.893
Not even the laws
of magic will apply.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.495
I can make them love you

22:11.497 --> 22:14.498
without you having to give up
being the dark one.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.468
Don't you realize?

22:17.470 --> 22:20.304
You can
finally have it all.

22:20.306 --> 22:22.873
No...

22:22.875 --> 22:24.608
I can't.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.511
I won't trust you.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.681
All you care about's
yourself.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.150
I care about you!
Always have!

22:33.152 --> 22:36.153
And I worked tirelessly
to reunite us!

22:36.155 --> 22:40.291
And now we can be
a family again.

22:40.293 --> 22:44.195
And not just
with belle and Gideon.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.064
What do you mean by that?

22:49.067 --> 22:53.604
With my new powers,
i can bring back the dead.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.007
Like baelfire.

22:57.009 --> 23:01.078
Your first son
that you lost.

23:01.080 --> 23:05.116
All your desires
can be had.

23:09.421 --> 23:13.824
Your magic will really
allow us to have it all?

23:19.264 --> 23:22.066
Without a doubt.

23:33.945 --> 23:36.147
Well, there's just
one problem.

23:38.850 --> 23:41.685
All magic comes
with a price.

23:47.293 --> 23:50.094
And I'm no longer
willing to pay it.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.598
You will not be winning
any battle.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.101
And you are gonna suffer

23:57.103 --> 24:00.805
for what you did
to belle and Gideon.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.774
You may think
that you can stop me,

24:03.776 --> 24:06.076
but that doesn't mean
the final battle is over.

24:06.078 --> 24:10.915
After all, I'm not the one
who's going to kill the savior.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.617
That's what I learned
from the runes.

24:13.619 --> 24:17.054
Darkness can't
snuff out the light.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.156
It's not strong enough.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.193
Only light
can snuff out light.

24:23.428 --> 24:26.096
Gideon.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.898
You have his heart.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.100
Yes.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.470
And I commanded him
to kill the savior.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.341
Not even my death
can stop that.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.847
In fact, I suspect
it would ensure it.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.818
Well...

24:47.820 --> 24:50.120
There's only one way
to find out.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.964
I remember.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.705
just in time, savior.

25:42.841 --> 25:45.509
Henry. Go!

25:57.189 --> 25:58.756
Rumple?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.059
Belle.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.028
Yeah. I'm awake.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.996
The curse is broken.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.099
When I killed her.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.103
You killed your mother?

26:14.606 --> 26:16.440
W-where's Gideon?

26:18.877 --> 26:20.344
I don't know.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.047
Still under her control.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.015
But I think
i know who to ask.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.383
Henry.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.352
C-can you stop him?

26:28.354 --> 26:30.054
I don't intend to stop him.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.692
I intend to save him.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.129
Gideon.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.130
You don't
want to do this.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.365
You can't win.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.434
Maybe.
But I also can't give up.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.137
Henry!

26:48.139 --> 26:49.640
Let's go. Go!

27:01.120 --> 27:02.286
-You did it.
-Kinda.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.121
That won't hold very long.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.656
It's okay.
The black fairy's got his heart.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.458
Gold's gonna get it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.127
I appreciate your optimism, kid,
but we got to go.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.767
you think
his heart's down here?

27:16.769 --> 27:18.602
I know my mother.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.804
This is where
she'd hide it.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.140
If I find it --
-aah!

27:23.142 --> 27:24.141
Belle, you all right?

27:24.143 --> 27:25.976
My ankle.
I think it's twisted.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.078
-Well, let me fix it.
-No, no! Just go ahead.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.981
We're racing against the clock.
I'll only slow you down.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.617
Go. Save Emma!
Save our son!

27:37.023 --> 27:38.956
can you see him?

27:38.958 --> 27:41.191
We lost him.
But he won't be far behind.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.460
I'm so sorry
that I ever doubted you.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.362
I know. It's okay.
It was the curse.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.097
I'm just happy
it's broken.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.666
Snow: We are, too.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.335
Oh, dad.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.543
Some honeymoon, huh?

27:59.545 --> 28:02.146
Oh, we'll get there.
We'll get there.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.247
Okay.

28:22.167 --> 28:25.002
Henry: She left him
with one last command.

28:25.004 --> 28:28.005
Kill you no matter what.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.374
Well, then
we'll kill him.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.576
No. It's a trap.

28:32.578 --> 28:36.413
If Gideon kills Emma,
then light will be destroyed.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.850
And if Emma kills him,
then she'll darken herself

28:39.852 --> 28:41.919
and light will be
destroyed anyway.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.153
You don't have to kill him.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.422
Just hold him off
until gold gets his heart.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.224
Well, there's no
holding him off.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.926
But she is right.

28:50.095 --> 28:52.262
It's a trap,
and it's perfect.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.398
No matter what,
darkness wins.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.500
I'm not telling you to give up.
You can't.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.602
Emma, you of all people
should know,

28:58.604 --> 29:00.104
there's always a third way.

29:09.013 --> 29:11.248
Remember when you first
came to storybrooke?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.183
We hated each other.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.119
-Regina.
-No, it's true.

29:15.121 --> 29:18.055
I was Henry's mother,
but you said you were.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.057
And we fought.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.860
And oh, boy,
did we ever fight.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.030
But you found a third way.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.701
We were both his mother.

29:32.237 --> 29:35.439
Earlier today,
i saw my evil half...

29:37.108 --> 29:39.076
...be selfless.

29:39.078 --> 29:43.113
She saved us all.
I never saw that coming.

29:44.249 --> 29:47.151
Just like however you're
going to get out of this,

29:47.153 --> 29:49.486
you haven't seen yet.

29:50.488 --> 29:52.656
But you will.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.726
Sounds like you're talking
about hope.

29:55.728 --> 29:57.928
Something you taught me
all those years ago

29:57.930 --> 30:01.398
when...You didn't
give up on me.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.734
What should I do?

30:03.736 --> 30:06.270
You'll know
when the time comes.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.108
I'm afraid that time
has indeed come.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.043
-Son of a bitch!
-Dad, stop!

30:13.978 --> 30:16.246
I got this.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.619
Let her go.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.207
There's your heart,
Gideon.

30:44.309 --> 30:47.945
Now let's save you.
Let's stop you.

30:47.947 --> 30:51.048
But why would you stop him?

30:51.050 --> 30:53.150
Now, remember
what mother said.

30:53.152 --> 30:56.653
"With the death of the savior,
you can have it all."

30:56.655 --> 30:59.156
You're nothing but a devil
on my shoulder.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.491
Doesn't mean to say
I'm wrong, dearie.

31:01.493 --> 31:05.729
This is our last chance
to finally get everything.

31:05.731 --> 31:08.732
Love and power.

31:08.734 --> 31:11.902
All you have to do now
is put the heart down

31:11.904 --> 31:16.240
and let our boy
finish his mission.

31:18.343 --> 31:20.677
No.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.280
I won't betray my family.

31:24.482 --> 31:27.150
I will do the right thing.

31:28.253 --> 31:30.854
I was destined
to become the savior.

31:30.856 --> 31:33.490
And now you're
fated to change magic!

31:33.492 --> 31:37.327
In this new world,
we will make the rules.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.329
Belle wants to see
the world.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.999
Well, go on.
Spend 100 years seeing it,

31:42.001 --> 31:43.934
then 100 years wrecking it.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.438
No.

31:49.874 --> 31:54.344
It won't...Be...Real.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.548
Gideon, stop.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.684
Do not kill Emma swan.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.360
Did you really think it was
gonna be that easy?

32:10.362 --> 32:13.297
This is the black fairy's spell
we're talking about here!

32:13.299 --> 32:16.433
You may want
to do the right thing,

32:16.435 --> 32:22.906
but as we all know, we can't
always get what we want.

32:22.908 --> 32:24.541
Now, can we?

32:39.257 --> 32:40.958
no one's going to save you.

32:49.334 --> 32:51.802
No one needs to save me!
I'm the savior!

32:54.840 --> 32:56.907
I'm fighting
for the people I love.

33:00.446 --> 33:03.013
ultimately, I am a hero.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.015
I am hope.
I am light!

33:05.984 --> 33:07.351
And light cannot destroy
darkness.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.785
It can only create
more light.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.454
I will not kill
innocents!

33:10.456 --> 33:12.456
I will do
what all saviors must!

33:12.458 --> 33:13.690
I will give hope...

33:21.032 --> 33:23.000
...no matter what the cost.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.939
No!

33:38.950 --> 33:41.418
I'm sorry, Emma.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.422
I was hoping
you'd save us both.

33:50.128 --> 33:51.261
Nnghh!

34:22.159 --> 34:24.393
I failed you, belle.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.130
I failed our family.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.069
I made the right choice.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.139
It just didn't work out.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.181
Hey.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.300
I love you.

35:12.276 --> 35:13.844
I love you, too.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.948
I love you, too!

35:55.953 --> 35:58.355
Is that...

35:58.357 --> 36:00.357
It's Gideon.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.466
A fresh start.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.067
A happy ending.

36:11.969 --> 36:14.538
No.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.673
A happy beginning.

36:40.831 --> 36:41.998
Henry!

36:45.370 --> 36:47.637
I think
this belongs to you.

36:57.048 --> 37:01.051
"when good and evil both did the
right thing, faith was restored.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.720
The final battle was won."

37:08.060 --> 37:09.426
That's it.

37:09.428 --> 37:12.395
That's all?
No "the end"?

37:12.397 --> 37:13.763
No.

37:13.765 --> 37:17.100
'Course not.
Because this isn't the end.

37:17.102 --> 37:20.904
I mean, maybe of this book,
but...It isn't the end, end.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.441
So...What now?

37:24.443 --> 37:28.678
Now?
Now we get to see what's next.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.015
Believing in even the
possibility of a happy ending

37:32.017 --> 37:35.619
is a powerful thing, but living
with that kind of belief...

37:35.621 --> 37:38.021
That's the most powerful thing
of all.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.956
That's hope.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.225
So you asked, "what now?"

37:42.227 --> 37:45.028
Now we get to keep
going on.

37:46.063 --> 37:49.866
We get to keep doing
what we love...

37:49.868 --> 37:52.435
With the people we love.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.105
An ending isn't happiness.

37:57.074 --> 37:58.642
Being together is.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.103
hmm?

41:46.103 --> 41:48.838
<i> Ready for a new adventure?</i>

44:30.100 --> 44:32.268
Uh...Hello?

44:32.270 --> 44:34.771
Hi.
Are you Henry mills?

44:37.207 --> 44:38.875
Yeah.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.210
Yeah. Who are you?

44:41.212 --> 44:44.080
My name's Lucy.
I'm your daughter.

44:45.482 --> 44:47.116
I don't have a daughter.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.217
Yeah, you do.

44:48.219 --> 44:51.020
Now come on.
Your family needs you.
