WEBVTT

00:02.622 --> 00:05.157
Oh, yeah, baby.
Oh, take it all!

00:05.158 --> 00:07.059
Oh, oh, no,
you take it, baby.

00:07.060 --> 00:09.061
No, baby,
you take it all!

00:09.062 --> 00:12.998
- Oh, no, you take it, baby.
- No, baby, you take it!

00:12.999 --> 00:15.067
Dear God,
will one of you just take it

00:15.068 --> 00:16.802
and get it over with?

00:16.803 --> 00:19.004
Max, there is no way
you could be sleeping

00:19.005 --> 00:20.572
through Oleg
and Sophie.

00:25.245 --> 00:26.378
Does that actually work?

00:26.379 --> 00:30.315
It does,
with a little help from this.

00:30.316 --> 00:32.951
Gimme.

00:32.952 --> 00:34.086
Whoo!

00:34.087 --> 00:36.288
I was hoping
that'd be fruitier.

00:36.289 --> 00:38.390
I mean, they're here.

00:38.391 --> 00:40.492
They're there.
Then, they're here again.

00:40.493 --> 00:42.895
It's like we're a village
under attack.

00:42.896 --> 00:44.530
Yup, just a matter
of time

00:44.531 --> 00:46.765
till someone sends in
a drone.

00:47.967 --> 00:49.768
And it's not just
that moaning.

00:49.769 --> 00:52.604
I think I heard a big ball
rolling around up there.

00:52.605 --> 00:54.339
If a ball
is rolling around up there,

00:54.340 --> 00:56.141
Oleg should stop
and see a doctor.

00:57.811 --> 01:01.246
This couldn't be
any more intrusive.

01:01.247 --> 01:02.514
Oh!

01:07.387 --> 01:08.587
Uhoh.

01:10.323 --> 01:12.491
Sorry about that.

01:15.511 --> 01:16.878
A bowling ball?

01:16.879 --> 01:19.414
And why do they need
a bowling ball?

01:19.415 --> 01:22.901
Maybe they ran out
of holes.

01:22.902 --> 01:26.672
Have you guys
seen a ball?

01:26.673 --> 01:29.141
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

01:30.677 --> 01:34.313

01:43.158 --> 01:44.658
Pick up, Max.

01:44.659 --> 01:46.594
And sorry about the hole
in your ceiling.

01:46.645 --> 01:48.512
Oleg, I'm not even
gonna ask you

01:48.513 --> 01:49.947
to keep it
in your pants anymore,

01:49.948 --> 01:53.551
but could you keep it
in your apartment?

01:56.555 --> 01:59.056
- Oh, hey, Sophie.
- Hey, Max.

01:59.057 --> 02:01.492
Oh, spring is in
the air.

02:01.493 --> 02:03.894
This is the time of year
in Poland

02:03.895 --> 02:05.329
when the snow
would melt

02:05.330 --> 02:09.366
and all our dead relatives
would float back to us.

02:09.366 --> 02:11.035
I've never been
to Europe,

02:11.036 --> 02:14.638
but it sounds beautiful.

02:14.639 --> 02:16.674
Max, where is Caroline?

02:16.675 --> 02:18.576
And don't tell me
she's in the ladies' room,

02:18.577 --> 02:20.377
because I already peeked
under all those stalls.

02:20.378 --> 02:22.646
She wasn't there.

02:22.647 --> 02:25.082
But I saw things.

02:27.018 --> 02:31.622
Well, congratulations
on finally seeing those things.

02:31.623 --> 02:33.290
She's 20 minutes late,
and, as the boss,

02:33.291 --> 02:34.625
I will
not have it.

02:34.626 --> 02:37.895
Wow, someone woke up
on the wrong side of his crib.

02:40.065 --> 02:42.299
You're late.
This is unacceptable.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.267
Don't mind him.

02:43.268 --> 02:44.802
He just saw
his first vagina,

02:44.803 --> 02:48.539
and he's furious.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.673
Okay, here's the thing.

02:49.674 --> 02:51.709
I had to take a nap
because Oleg and Sophie

02:51.710 --> 02:53.544
were having sex
all night long.

02:53.545 --> 02:54.545
Not true.

02:54.546 --> 02:58.516
We took a break
to watch a porno.

02:58.517 --> 03:00.417
Punctuality
is the number one rule

03:00.418 --> 03:03.020
in my employee handbook,
which I've adorably named

03:03.021 --> 03:04.054
the <i>Han-book.</i>

03:04.055 --> 03:05.356
Relax, Han.

03:05.357 --> 03:06.624
Nobody's gonna die
if I'm not here

03:06.625 --> 03:08.225
to drop off
a tuna melt.

03:08.226 --> 03:11.195
In fact, they're more likely
to die if I do drop it off.

03:11.196 --> 03:13.430
Late, and with an attitude.

03:13.431 --> 03:15.032
You think you're too good
for the diner?

03:15.033 --> 03:17.401
Of course
she thinks that.

03:17.402 --> 03:20.938
I think sourdough bread
is too good for this diner.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.541
Well, what other career option
do you have, Caroline?

03:23.542 --> 03:25.276
Hmm, let's see.
Cupcakes?

03:25.277 --> 03:27.178
No, wait, your shop
didn't last six months.

03:27.179 --> 03:29.213
- Don't go there, Han.
- Oh, I'm already there.

03:29.214 --> 03:32.116
And now I'm back.

03:32.117 --> 03:35.519
Why so moody, Han?
Are you man-struating?

03:35.520 --> 03:39.423
Is it that time
of the man-th?

03:39.424 --> 03:41.692
That shop
was our dream, Han,

03:41.693 --> 03:44.595
and this is just
a dumb diner.

03:44.596 --> 03:46.997
- You're fired.
- Ooh! I'm fired?

03:46.998 --> 03:49.166
Max, Han just fired me.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.468
You lucky
son of a whore.

03:51.469 --> 03:54.705
I'm serious, Caroline.
You called my diner "dumb."

03:54.706 --> 03:56.907
Well, at least my diner's
still open and successful,

03:56.908 --> 03:59.109
whereas your cupcake shop
was so dumb, it failed.

03:59.110 --> 04:01.612
Ooh, he did not
go there.

04:01.613 --> 04:03.180
I went there,
and then I came back,

04:03.181 --> 04:06.784
and then
I went there again.

04:06.785 --> 04:08.719
You know what?
I don't need this.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.554
Well, actually,
you do kinda need this

04:10.555 --> 04:12.022
'cause we broke.

04:12.023 --> 04:14.792
Broke or not, I don't have
to stand here and take this.

04:14.793 --> 04:17.228
- I quit.
- Oh, really? You quit?

04:17.228 --> 04:18.696
You must be dumber
than my diner

04:18.697 --> 04:21.832
because I already
fired you.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.568
Han, I know you've had it
up to here,

04:24.569 --> 04:28.873
but you need to relax.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.815
Can you believe
Han fired me?

04:37.816 --> 04:39.483
I mean, where does
he get off?

04:39.484 --> 04:44.455
Probably in <i>Buffy</i>
<i>The Vampire Slayer</i> chat rooms.

04:44.456 --> 04:47.591
Have you been standing here
by the door this whole time?

04:47.592 --> 04:49.126
I didn't even pee.
I was afraid I'd miss you.

04:49.127 --> 04:52.329
So, hold on.

04:52.330 --> 04:55.399
So, basically,
you had the same day as a puppy?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.401
Han's lucky
I work there.

04:57.402 --> 05:00.771
I bring class and sophistication
to that place.

05:00.772 --> 05:01.772
There's no toilet paper,

05:01.773 --> 05:04.808
and I just used
the last coffee filter.

05:04.809 --> 05:06.477
You are sophisticatin'
the hell

05:06.478 --> 05:10.147
out of that toilet
right now.

05:10.148 --> 05:11.248
And you know what?

05:11.249 --> 05:13.083
You can tell Han
that the only way

05:13.084 --> 05:16.220
I am ever going back there
is if he apologizes.

05:16.221 --> 05:19.023
Okay, but first,
he wanted me to tell you this.

05:19.024 --> 05:20.391
The only way
you're ever going back there

05:20.392 --> 05:22.126
is if <i>you</i> apologize.

05:22.127 --> 05:24.929
Well, an apology from me
is not happening.

05:27.165 --> 05:29.667
Oh, yeah, baby.
Ooh, take it all.

05:29.668 --> 05:31.335
Oh, oh, no,
you take it, baby.

05:31.336 --> 05:32.636
Oh, baby--

05:32.637 --> 05:36.106
And that is not happening
again tonight either.

05:41.546 --> 05:44.648
Again?
That could've hit us.

05:44.649 --> 05:47.718
Now, <i>that's</i> unsafe sex.

05:49.454 --> 05:50.821
I think it's pretty neighborly
of us

05:50.822 --> 05:53.624
to return someone's
sex bowling ball.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.026
You know we have to bury
those mitts now.

05:56.027 --> 05:57.394
And we have to tell them
to stop

05:57.395 --> 05:59.396
whatever it is
they're doing up here.

05:59.397 --> 06:02.099
Probably a 7-10 split.

06:03.969 --> 06:05.803
And now
they're not making noise.

06:05.804 --> 06:07.104
It's like when you go
to the zoo,

06:07.105 --> 06:10.107
and the lion
goes inside.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.508
It's Max
and Caroline.

06:11.509 --> 06:15.312
Your ball came
into our yard again.

06:16.548 --> 06:19.083
Hi.
Yeah, it's not a good time.

06:19.084 --> 06:20.384
Uh, we're role-playing,

06:20.385 --> 06:23.887
and, obviously,
I'm Beyonce.

06:23.888 --> 06:26.657
♪ Uh, oh, uh, oh,
uh, oh, oh, oh ♪

06:26.658 --> 06:29.560
Yeah.
Hey, Jay Z?

06:29.561 --> 06:32.262
Look at all
the single ladies.

06:32.263 --> 06:33.297
Oh, yeah, baby.

06:33.298 --> 06:35.332
Jay Z and I
have a lot in common.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.800
He bought
the Brooklyn Nets.

06:36.801 --> 06:40.337
I bought my hairnets
in Brooklyn.

06:40.338 --> 06:42.906
I'm not surprised
that you're Jay Z and Beyonce,

06:42.907 --> 06:46.176
but I am kinda surprised
that they bowl.

06:46.177 --> 06:47.411
Where should
I put this?

06:47.412 --> 06:49.980
Oh, well, I'll tell you
what I told him.

06:49.981 --> 06:53.884
Put it anywhere
you want.

06:59.591 --> 07:02.960
So that's basically our ball
at this point.

07:02.961 --> 07:05.195
Look, you two may be
crazy in love,

07:05.196 --> 07:07.231
but your love
is driving us crazy.

07:09.034 --> 07:10.634
Crazy in love?

07:10.635 --> 07:13.237
Oh, come on.
We're not in love.

07:13.238 --> 07:16.040
Oleg and I
are just shtup buddies.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.775
Shtup buddies?

07:17.776 --> 07:19.343
I wouldn't say
that's all we are.

07:19.344 --> 07:20.544
Oh, no,
you're right.

07:20.545 --> 07:25.482
We also share
a CVS points reward card.

07:25.483 --> 07:29.887
Is it really a reward
if it comes from CVS?

07:29.888 --> 07:32.489
Can't you two ever do it
over at Oleg's apartment?

07:32.490 --> 07:35.125
Or are all
the lanes reserved?

07:35.126 --> 07:37.194
I have no idea
where he lives.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.496
Wait, you've never been
to Oleg's apartment?

07:39.497 --> 07:42.399
No, with my busy
work schedule,

07:42.400 --> 07:43.500
I don't have the time
to get

07:43.501 --> 07:45.803
the battery of shots
that I would need.

07:45.804 --> 07:48.105
Hey.
Hey, hey.

07:48.106 --> 07:50.207
You'd be surprised
by my apartment, Sophie.

07:50.208 --> 07:54.211
It's more than just the place
the quadruple orgasm was born.

07:55.847 --> 07:58.582
Yeah, well,
that sounds nice.

07:58.583 --> 08:01.018
Oh, yes.
Beyonc--

08:01.019 --> 08:02.653
Uh-oh.

08:02.654 --> 08:04.221
Yeah.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.523
Um, Beyonce's hair
just fell out.

08:06.524 --> 08:09.993
I gotta go get
my hot glue gun.

08:09.994 --> 08:13.130

to get shots?

08:21.506 --> 08:24.308
Yes.

08:24.309 --> 08:26.844
Maybe you two could help me
fix it up a little,

08:26.845 --> 08:28.112
give it
a feminine touch.

08:28.113 --> 08:30.314
Well, I'm out.

08:30.315 --> 08:31.748
You know what?
I'll do it.

08:31.749 --> 08:33.183
But I'm very recently
out of work,

08:33.183 --> 08:34.684
so I'm gonna have
to charge you.

08:34.686 --> 08:36.019
If you didn't,
you'd be the only girl

08:36.020 --> 08:38.989
who ever went to his apartment
without getting paid.

08:38.990 --> 08:41.457
You got a deal.

08:47.851 --> 08:48.984
Oleg's apartment's
this way.

08:48.985 --> 08:51.486
I can smell
the axe body spray.

08:51.737 --> 08:52.737
I'll just throw a couple
of these pillows around,

08:52.738 --> 08:54.339
and then we'll be gone.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.842
I can't believe I'm walking up
to Oleg's apartment.

08:56.843 --> 08:58.577
I always thought
I'd be dragged here unconscious

08:58.578 --> 09:02.314
with electrical tape
over my mouth.

09:02.315 --> 09:03.648
Afternoon, ladies.

09:03.649 --> 09:06.017
This is
where the magic happens.

09:06.018 --> 09:09.921
Well, I'm sure you've made
some women disappear here.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.992
Okay.

09:13.993 --> 09:15.527
Just off the top
of my head,

09:15.528 --> 09:19.364
I think we're gonna need
a couple more pillows.

09:19.365 --> 09:20.765
If you keep your apartment
like this,

09:20.766 --> 09:23.835
do you get to pay
1980s rent prices?

09:23.836 --> 09:25.570
You haven't even seen
the best part yet.

09:25.571 --> 09:26.738
Look.

09:30.243 --> 09:33.245
Goin' up the stairway
to heaven, baby.

09:33.246 --> 09:35.647
Oh, yeah.

09:35.648 --> 09:38.416
There it is.
That's my bed.

09:38.417 --> 09:41.853
Where are we?
Studio 69?

09:41.854 --> 09:44.156
That's 1,500 tracer bulbs.

09:44.157 --> 09:45.157
I tore most
of them out

09:45.158 --> 09:49.161
of the new Cineplex 14
in Queens.

09:49.162 --> 09:51.229
First of all,
I am smelling something

09:51.230 --> 09:54.533
that can only be described
as anti-antiperspirant.

09:54.534 --> 09:56.434
And, secondly...

09:57.436 --> 09:59.371
No woman wants to walk
into this.

09:59.372 --> 10:02.941
According to this,
685 already have.

10:02.942 --> 10:05.043
Actually, it's 1,685.

10:05.044 --> 10:08.513
After a thousand,
the counter resets.

10:08.514 --> 10:09.915
Look, if you don't
want Sophie to feel

10:09.916 --> 10:11.616
like she's next in line
at the DMV...

10:11.617 --> 10:14.219
More like the S-T-D-MV.

10:14.220 --> 10:16.955
Then we have a lot
of work to do.

10:16.956 --> 10:19.457
Okay.
Make it look romantic.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.927
When she comes in,
I want her to feel special,

10:21.928 --> 10:26.064
like she's the only woman
that's ever been here today.

10:26.065 --> 10:29.000
Let's just sit down
and talk about this.

10:29.001 --> 10:32.270
Oh, my God.
Max, is she dead?

10:32.271 --> 10:33.972
No.
She's Alexis.

10:33.973 --> 10:37.075
You have one of those
anatomically-correct real dolls!

10:37.076 --> 10:39.244
It's rare to see one
without a short, fat man

10:39.245 --> 10:41.513
standing next to it
with a button penis.

10:41.514 --> 10:43.548
They sell for $6,000,

10:43.549 --> 10:45.317
but I got her
for half off.

10:45.318 --> 10:47.953
She was
previously loved.

10:47.954 --> 10:49.421
Max, you are not
doing that.

10:49.422 --> 10:50.789
The hell I'm not.

10:50.790 --> 10:52.424
This is my one chance
to see a woman naked

10:52.425 --> 10:56.428
without having
to spoon her after.

10:56.429 --> 10:58.997
Respect.

10:58.998 --> 11:02.567
Well, you've made a lot
of strong choices here,

11:02.568 --> 11:04.703
but I'm not sure
they're all working together.

11:04.704 --> 11:08.139
For example, that sex swing
is fighting the goat.

11:08.140 --> 11:09.741
Now, why don't we start
by you going

11:09.742 --> 11:10.909
and getting us
some rubber gloves?

11:10.910 --> 11:13.111
Lots of them,
and the strongest bleach

11:13.112 --> 11:14.579
and soap products
you can find.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.214
Oh, and a Hazmat suit.

11:16.215 --> 11:18.316
Don't worry about the size.
I can belt it.

11:18.317 --> 11:20.585
But you're gonna keep
my good stuff, right?

11:20.586 --> 11:23.455
If I see any,
I'll consider it. Go.

11:23.456 --> 11:25.323
What are you going to do
with Alexis?

11:25.824 --> 11:28.026
Rehab, and then
a women's shelter in Montana.

11:28.027 --> 11:30.395
Go!

11:30.396 --> 11:32.330
I've got a lot of work
to do.

11:32.331 --> 11:33.632
But first...

11:37.003 --> 11:39.438
And I do it.
And I do it.

11:40.939 --> 11:43.008
Can you please
turn that off, Max?

11:43.009 --> 11:45.377
I'm starting to feel
a little dizzy...

11:46.445 --> 11:47.646
And I can't fall
on the floor,

11:47.647 --> 11:49.681
'cause I might stick
to it.

11:49.682 --> 11:51.149
You don't have
to do this!

11:51.150 --> 11:52.751
Just call Han
and apologize,

11:52.752 --> 11:55.587
and we can get outta here
before the syphilis sets in.

11:55.588 --> 11:58.256
No, he said some really
hurtful things to me,

11:58.257 --> 12:00.825
and I'd rather stay here
and work for Oleg and Alexis.

12:00.826 --> 12:02.560
At least
I'll have my dignity.

12:02.561 --> 12:04.396
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go climb

12:04.397 --> 12:07.632
the sperm-ship Enterprise.

12:07.633 --> 12:08.833
Let me just get
these curtains open

12:08.834 --> 12:10.101
so I can see better.

12:10.102 --> 12:14.472
Seeing better?
Is that the way to go?

12:14.473 --> 12:15.540
Oh.

12:15.541 --> 12:18.743
I'm walking
on a water bed.

12:18.744 --> 12:20.345
This is harder
than it looks.

12:20.346 --> 12:23.515
How many times
has that been said on this bed?

12:25.217 --> 12:26.885
Oh, my heel!

12:32.091 --> 12:34.959
I swallowed!
I accidentally swallowed.

12:36.595 --> 12:39.597
You know
that's been said.

12:43.936 --> 12:45.537
Max, we got a problem.

12:45.538 --> 12:46.971
See that girl?

12:46.972 --> 12:48.306
Oh, what?
The usual drill?

12:48.307 --> 12:51.443
You hold her arms, and I
punch her till she tips 20%?

12:51.444 --> 12:55.213
As much as I enjoy that
when we do it, no.

12:55.214 --> 12:58.283
She's here to apply
for Caroline's job.

12:58.284 --> 12:59.484
What?

12:59.485 --> 13:01.252
Han's really going through
with this?

13:01.253 --> 13:02.420
I thought
it was all talk,

13:02.421 --> 13:05.490
like when a Chihuahua
barks at a big dog.

13:05.491 --> 13:07.025
Me too.
I thought it would blow over.

13:07.026 --> 13:09.728
You know, like Han did
in the wind that time?

13:09.729 --> 13:11.029
But, no,
he is serious.

13:11.030 --> 13:14.332
No way.
I got this.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.900
Hi, is that your resume?

13:15.901 --> 13:18.269
Let's take
a little look-see.

13:18.270 --> 13:19.704
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

13:19.705 --> 13:21.239
Oh, you worked there?
Cool.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.707
Yep.
I'm a very hard worker.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.142
Good.
Can you block a punch?

13:24.143 --> 13:26.344
'Cause the owner hits us.

13:26.345 --> 13:27.445
He broke my femur.

13:27.446 --> 13:29.547
When I complained,
he broke the other one.

13:29.548 --> 13:32.817
Run before he sees me
talking to you.

13:32.818 --> 13:35.186
Earl, I gotta get Han
and Caroline to make up.

13:35.187 --> 13:36.721
I don't have access
to the pills I need

13:36.722 --> 13:38.490
to keep working here
without her.

13:38.491 --> 13:40.191
Any advice or pills?

13:40.192 --> 13:41.526
Well, let's see.

13:41.527 --> 13:43.762
We are kind of like
a family here,

13:43.763 --> 13:48.500
except I can see you
unsupervised on the weekends.

13:48.501 --> 13:49.968
And you didn't use
my college fund

13:49.969 --> 13:52.937
to buy a married man
a Corvette.

13:52.938 --> 13:55.206
And in my family,
when my kids would fight,

13:55.207 --> 13:57.575
I tried to get them
to talk to each other,

13:57.576 --> 13:59.444
because honesty
is key.

13:59.445 --> 14:02.113
But if that didn't work,
I'd lie to their faces--

14:02.114 --> 14:03.415
lock them in their room
and tell them

14:03.416 --> 14:06.651
that the other one
had three weeks to live.

14:06.652 --> 14:10.355
You know, what used to be known
as good parenting.

14:10.356 --> 14:13.057
Max, I've got 12
overqualified candidates

14:13.058 --> 14:15.293
coming in for
the waitress position today.

14:15.294 --> 14:18.296
Thank you,
crumbling economy!

14:18.297 --> 14:20.365
You know, Han,
here at this diner,

14:20.366 --> 14:22.300
we're kind of like
a little family, and--

14:22.301 --> 14:23.334
oh, I can't do this.

14:23.335 --> 14:25.637
Caroline has three weeks
left to live.

14:25.638 --> 14:27.238
I'm serious.
She drank Oleg's water bed.

14:27.239 --> 14:28.873
It's just a matter
of time.

14:28.874 --> 14:30.208
Nice try, Max.

14:30.209 --> 14:31.943
I'm not going
to give her back her job.

14:31.944 --> 14:34.746
She should've checked herself
before she wrecked herself.

14:34.747 --> 14:36.848
Come on.
Hire her back.

14:36.849 --> 14:38.082
Be the bigger man.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.118
And note,
I did not make a short joke,

14:40.119 --> 14:41.653
because this
is important,

14:41.654 --> 14:43.154
and also because I'm still
working on something

14:43.155 --> 14:45.056
with Peter Dinklage's name.

14:45.057 --> 14:48.293
No way, Max.
I am holding firm.

14:48.294 --> 14:51.162
You know, firm Han
is kinda hot.

14:51.163 --> 14:52.230
- He is?
- Yeah.

14:52.231 --> 14:53.665
I'm kinda feeling
firm Han.

14:53.666 --> 14:55.800
I have no interest
in feeling the firm part,

14:55.801 --> 14:58.136
but I'll hang out
with the rest.

14:58.137 --> 14:59.637
You want to hang out
with me?

14:59.638 --> 15:01.239
I'm generally free
mondays through Fridays,

15:01.240 --> 15:02.240
mornings and evenings,

15:02.241 --> 15:05.343
and my weekends
are wide open.

15:05.344 --> 15:06.778
I may have a wedding
to go to in June, but--

15:06.779 --> 15:08.313
Breathe.

15:08.314 --> 15:09.380
Come over tomorrow.

15:09.381 --> 15:10.682
Caroline
will be at Oleg's.

15:10.683 --> 15:12.150
We can get stoned
and watch a movie.

15:12.151 --> 15:13.751
The last time
I was stoned

15:13.752 --> 15:17.555
was from a contact high
I got at a concert.

15:17.556 --> 15:20.625
Well, those wiggle shows
do get crazy.

15:28.829 --> 15:29.863
Look at us, Max,

15:29.864 --> 15:31.531
hanging outside of work
at your place

15:31.532 --> 15:33.466
like a couple of homeys.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.969
Yeah,
and where is my homey?

15:35.970 --> 15:39.672
Oh, it's this way.
I can smell the axe body spray.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.374
Now, what movie
should we watch?

15:41.375 --> 15:43.676
I brought <i>Shrek,</i>
<i>Shrek 2, Shrek 3,</i>

15:43.677 --> 15:48.481
<i>Shrek 3-D,</i> and that
Cameron Diaz cancer movie.

15:48.482 --> 15:51.451
Is there one
where Shrek has cancer?

15:52.920 --> 15:55.422
Wow.
This is completely--

15:55.423 --> 15:59.592
the same place
I always live at.

15:59.593 --> 16:01.027
Max, it's so pretty.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.495
I thought your place
would have furniture

16:02.496 --> 16:05.598
made out of razor blades
or something.

16:05.599 --> 16:08.968
I wish.
That sounds bitchin'.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.370
What are you guys
doing here?

16:10.371 --> 16:12.372
What is Caroline
doing here?

16:12.373 --> 16:13.840
You said she was going to be
at Oleg's.

16:13.841 --> 16:15.241
I <i>am</i> at Oleg's.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.944
You guys live with Oleg?

16:17.945 --> 16:20.146
You told him
this was our apartment?

16:20.147 --> 16:22.749
As a wise person
once told me, sometimes,

16:22.750 --> 16:24.751
you gotta lie
to keep your family together.

16:24.752 --> 16:26.186
I'm not letting
anyone leave

16:26.187 --> 16:27.620
until you talk
to each other.

16:27.621 --> 16:31.257
I don't understand.
Are we not smoking weed?

16:33.794 --> 16:36.429
Oh, I already did.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.697
I don't know
what his problem is.

16:37.698 --> 16:40.033
He fired me for missing
20 minutes of work.

16:40.034 --> 16:43.603
Why doesn't he fire himself
for missing puberty?

16:43.604 --> 16:44.771
Let it go, Han.

16:44.772 --> 16:48.241
She spent her morning
dusting a strap-on.

16:48.242 --> 16:49.876
I didn't fire you
because you were late.

16:49.877 --> 16:52.112
I fired you because you
crapped all over the diner,

16:52.113 --> 16:54.214
and you forgot that diner
lifted you up

16:54.215 --> 16:55.215
when you had nothing.

16:55.216 --> 16:56.616
Well, I lifted you up

16:56.617 --> 16:59.519
when you couldn't reach
the canned corn.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.689
So, we're even.
Fight over.

17:02.690 --> 17:06.425
What the hell did you do
to my apartment?

17:06.426 --> 17:10.930
It looks like you could film
a douche commercial in here.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.234
Oleg, this is what
you asked for: Romantic.

17:15.236 --> 17:16.402
Romantic?

17:16.403 --> 17:18.605
My place went from
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>

17:18.606 --> 17:22.474
to fifty shades
of beige.

17:22.476 --> 17:25.377
Where's my sex swing?
Where's my sex chair?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.646
Where's my poster
that says,

17:26.646 --> 17:29.582
"Poke her in the front,
lick her in the back"?

17:29.583 --> 17:31.017
Oleg, relax.

17:31.018 --> 17:33.253
All your stuff's either
in the basement or the closet.

17:33.254 --> 17:35.121
And I think would know more
about what a woman

17:35.122 --> 17:36.789
would like to come home to
than a man

17:36.790 --> 17:39.526
whose last girlfriend
was made in the Philippines.

17:41.095 --> 17:42.362
It's me!

17:42.363 --> 17:44.731
Hide your kids!
Hide your wife!

17:44.732 --> 17:46.199
Sophie!
She can't know you're here.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.401
Go, go,
all of you.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.336
Han!
Get in the closet!

17:50.337 --> 17:52.705
Putting a guy who's
in the closet in the closet?

17:52.706 --> 17:54.474
That's like gay
nesting dolls.

17:54.475 --> 17:58.411
I'm not gay.
I'm a metrosexual.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.449
This is where
the magic happens?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.385
Oh.

18:05.386 --> 18:08.188
Oh, no.

18:08.189 --> 18:11.991
Do you live
with your mother?

18:11.992 --> 18:13.693
What?
You don't like?

18:13.694 --> 18:16.062
I thought you would enjoy
the girl's touch.

18:16.063 --> 18:18.131
What girls?

18:18.132 --> 18:22.502
The Golden Girls?

18:22.503 --> 18:24.037
Sophie hates it.

18:24.038 --> 18:26.606
I should've just thrown
a boiled ham on the bed.

18:26.607 --> 18:27.840
Oh, no.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.776
My hair's stuck
in Oleg's clothes.

18:29.777 --> 18:31.844
Please don't let it be
a pant zipper.

18:31.845 --> 18:34.247
Oh.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.822
Han, Alexis.
Alexis, Han.

18:42.823 --> 18:44.924
Ew, take it away
from me.

18:44.925 --> 18:49.062
It's so heavy--
Oh, no, oh, no.

18:49.063 --> 18:50.396
Help.
Get her off of me.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.232
Why?
You're finally getting some.

18:52.933 --> 18:54.468
Take it... take it!

18:54.533 --> 18:55.768
I got it, I got it..

18:56.003 --> 18:58.768
Oh... Oh...
Oh... Whoa....

19:00.608 --> 19:05.111
Look! Han's fallen
and he can't get it up!

19:07.214 --> 19:09.082
What the hell
is going on here?

19:09.083 --> 19:13.519
I mean, this is freaky
even for me.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.521
Sophie, I can explain.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.991
I hired Caroline
to redo my apartment

19:17.992 --> 19:20.026
so it wouldn't be
the dirty bachelor pad

19:20.027 --> 19:21.794
you were expecting.

19:21.795 --> 19:24.897
But you are the dirty bachelor
that I'm expecting.

19:24.898 --> 19:26.366
And why would you
hire Caroline?

19:26.367 --> 19:28.668
She doesn't know
about sexy stuff.

19:28.669 --> 19:29.869
She couldn't even figure out
what we do

19:29.870 --> 19:32.472
with the bowling ball.

19:32.473 --> 19:35.008
Sophie, you should've seen
what was in here.

19:35.009 --> 19:37.777
I mean, he had this
anatomically correct real doll

19:37.778 --> 19:39.479
he named Alexis.

19:39.480 --> 19:44.083
Yeah, well,
she's very pretty.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.786
He had a sex swing.

19:46.787 --> 19:50.056
Ooh, a sex swing.

19:50.057 --> 19:51.291
What are you
gonna tell me now?

19:51.292 --> 19:53.059
That he had a water bed?

19:53.060 --> 19:54.060
I did.

19:54.061 --> 19:55.962
It had
1,500 tracer bulbs.

19:55.963 --> 19:58.164
It was hot.

19:58.165 --> 20:00.033
Well, who has it now?

20:00.034 --> 20:02.902
I wanna be with him.

20:02.903 --> 20:05.405
Oh, hell, I'm tired
of all this role-playing,

20:05.406 --> 20:06.739
so I'm just going
to say it.

20:06.740 --> 20:10.276
Sophie,
I am in love with you.

20:12.813 --> 20:15.515
Oh.

20:15.516 --> 20:18.217
Well, I haven't
said this to a man

20:18.218 --> 20:21.821
in a very long time,

20:21.822 --> 20:26.559
but I like you
a little bit.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.594
I don't know what
she's talking about, Caroline.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.196
I think it's pretty.

20:30.197 --> 20:32.165
You make
everything prettier,

20:32.166 --> 20:35.068
even the dumb diner.

20:35.069 --> 20:37.303
Your diner's not dumb.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.538
I miss the diner.

20:38.539 --> 20:40.073
And it misses you.

20:40.074 --> 20:42.508
You can have
your job back.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.644
Is it just 'cause I'm stoned,
or did anyone else

20:44.645 --> 20:48.147
feel that deep connection
between them?

20:48.148 --> 20:50.583
Could you all leave?

20:50.584 --> 20:53.586
I wanna be alone
with Oleg...

20:53.587 --> 20:57.857
And Alexis.

20:57.858 --> 21:00.860
Now are we going
to smoke weed?

21:00.861 --> 21:02.862
Yeah, I'm dying
to see you high.

21:02.863 --> 21:05.966
Well, as high
as you can get.

21:06.569 --> 21:11.370
