WEBVTT

00:05.484 --> 00:09.154
...and I after I turned their
responses into hard numbers,

00:09.156 --> 00:11.856
I presented my findings
to the CO in the Three-One,

00:11.858 --> 00:14.959
who adjusted the manner
of our policing, and,

00:14.961 --> 00:17.395
as you can see,
crime is down,

00:17.397 --> 00:19.297
public confidence is up.

00:19.299 --> 00:22.834
Correlation is not causation,
Sergeant Delgado.

00:22.836 --> 00:23.968
Of course not, sir.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.004
But after I controlled
for other variables,

00:26.006 --> 00:27.305
I think there's a direct link.

00:27.307 --> 00:29.607
And you gathered all your data
through social media?

00:29.609 --> 00:30.742
Well, these days,
how else are you gonna hear

00:30.744 --> 00:31.976
what kids are thinking?

00:31.978 --> 00:34.245
It's pretty unusual for someone
in the rank and file

00:34.247 --> 00:36.881
to develop a program on their
own time and their own dime.

00:36.883 --> 00:38.950
Young people want to be heard,
and I want to help.

00:38.952 --> 00:40.484
But, sir, I never
represented this

00:40.486 --> 00:42.286
as department sanctioned,

00:42.288 --> 00:43.888
just an effort
by a guy in the hood,

00:43.890 --> 00:45.489
who happened to be
also NYPD.

00:45.491 --> 00:46.657
Relax, Sergeant.

00:46.659 --> 00:48.559
You showed initiative.
That's a good thing.

00:48.561 --> 00:50.661
Well, I never forgot the advice
of my training officer,

00:50.663 --> 00:52.463
Lieutenant Gormley:

00:52.465 --> 00:53.664
"Never bitch about a problem

00:53.666 --> 00:55.466
without pitching a solution."

00:55.468 --> 00:57.535
He does have a way with words.

00:57.537 --> 00:58.602
Commissioner,

00:58.604 --> 01:00.704
if you see fit to implement
this program,

01:00.706 --> 01:04.007
I will work nonstop
to ensure its success.

01:04.010 --> 01:06.177
If something lights me up,
I'm all over it.

01:07.846 --> 01:10.581
Anything to add,
Lieutenant Gormley?

01:14.619 --> 01:18.222
He said everything
that needs saying.

01:18.224 --> 01:19.456
Not my decision, anyway.

01:19.458 --> 01:22.826
Now, if you excuse me,
I got work to do.

01:24.663 --> 01:25.863
Thank you, Sergeant.

01:25.865 --> 01:28.399
I'll take that
under advisement.

01:28.401 --> 01:31.001
Let me walk you out.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.403
(indistinct conversations)

01:32.405 --> 01:34.104
NICKY:
Join CSC and our fight

01:34.106 --> 01:36.273
for social justice on campus!

01:36.275 --> 01:38.375
We don't accept, we disrupt!

01:38.377 --> 01:39.743
You can give money
or sign up

01:39.745 --> 01:41.879
for a "Check Your
Privilege" workshop!

01:41.881 --> 01:42.779
Hope this helps.

01:42.781 --> 01:43.847
Thank you.

01:43.849 --> 01:46.116
You know how to work
a crowd, Nicky.

01:46.118 --> 01:47.751
One nickel at a time.

01:47.753 --> 01:49.353
Every little bit helps.

01:49.355 --> 01:51.321
Miss Watkins?

01:51.323 --> 01:52.489
That's me.

01:52.491 --> 01:53.457
Ted Meeks, security investigator

01:53.459 --> 01:54.458
for the university.

01:54.460 --> 01:55.625
You left a voicemail about

01:55.627 --> 01:57.294
some sort of threat
you received last night?

01:57.296 --> 01:59.996
It wasn't
"some sort of threat."

01:59.998 --> 02:01.498
Someone's trying
to kill me.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.399
What?!

02:02.401 --> 02:03.400
MEEKS: And this was on

02:03.402 --> 02:04.568
the school message board.

02:04.570 --> 02:05.902
The social studies forum.

02:05.904 --> 02:07.671
Social <i> justice</i> forum.

02:07.673 --> 02:09.739
I'm trying to make things
better on campus,

02:09.741 --> 02:12.175
and this troll starts
threatening me.

02:12.177 --> 02:13.510
Here, I printed it out.

02:15.112 --> 02:16.947
Chrissie, why didn't
you tell me about this?

02:16.949 --> 02:18.281
I didn't want to scare you.

02:18.283 --> 02:20.016
I'm scared enough
as it is.

02:20.018 --> 02:22.552
These aren't exactly threats.

02:22.554 --> 02:24.054
What are you talking about?

02:24.056 --> 02:25.989
"Go to hell, bitch."?

02:25.991 --> 02:26.856
"Crybaby feminists

02:26.858 --> 02:28.324
"should be run
off campus."?

02:28.326 --> 02:30.593
It's rude, yeah,
but the First Amendment

02:30.595 --> 02:32.562
doesn't protect you
from hurt feelings.

02:32.564 --> 02:34.397
(scoffs quietly)

02:34.399 --> 02:35.732
So you're not gonna
do anything?

02:35.734 --> 02:37.233
I'm happy to take
the report.

02:37.235 --> 02:38.268
That's it? A report?

02:38.270 --> 02:39.502
And you are?

02:39.504 --> 02:40.970
Nicky Reagan, treasurer of CSC.

02:40.972 --> 02:43.506
Well, Miss Reagan...
You know what?

02:43.508 --> 02:45.041
Forget it.

02:45.043 --> 02:46.743
I get hostility all the time.

02:46.745 --> 02:48.845
What's a little more?

02:49.747 --> 02:53.583
Join CSC in the struggle
against racism,

02:53.585 --> 02:55.518
sexism, and the hate

02:55.520 --> 02:58.488
we see around us every day!

02:58.490 --> 03:00.123
No one else
is gonna help us,

03:00.125 --> 03:02.225
so we have to
help ourselves!

03:06.130 --> 03:09.098
Reagan, how many cups
is that today?

03:09.100 --> 03:11.734
You know what I like best
about coming here every day?

03:11.736 --> 03:12.969
Making the streets safer?

03:12.971 --> 03:15.171
No. I don't have to
listen to my wife nag me

03:15.173 --> 03:17.306
about how much
coffee I drink.

03:17.308 --> 03:18.341
So you're not
gonna tell me?

03:18.343 --> 03:19.775
Not unless you want
to tell me

03:19.777 --> 03:21.110
how many times a day it is

03:21.112 --> 03:23.212
that you're texting
that guy from Vice.

03:23.214 --> 03:24.714
Moving on.

03:24.716 --> 03:26.949
What the hell's
going on here?

03:26.951 --> 03:28.384
Prison break at
Bethany Correctional.

03:28.386 --> 03:29.552
Two women tunneled out.

03:29.554 --> 03:31.654
Not before stabbing
a guard who discovered them.

03:31.656 --> 03:32.888
Oh, yeah?
Who's the women?

03:32.890 --> 03:34.690
Trina Hamilton
and Rose Butler.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.525
Both doing time
for murder.

03:38.528 --> 03:40.229
What's wrong, Reagan?

03:40.231 --> 03:42.598
I collared Rose Butler.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.532
You did?

03:43.534 --> 03:45.901
DANNY: Yeah.

03:45.903 --> 03:49.338
And she never should
have gone to prison.

03:50.807 --> 03:52.508
What do you mean
someone you put away

03:52.510 --> 03:54.710
shouldn't have
gone to prison?

03:54.712 --> 03:58.514
I caught a homicide,
four years ago, in Kips Bay.

03:58.516 --> 04:00.382
When I got there,
Rose was standing over

04:00.384 --> 04:01.750
her dead husband,
who was lying on the floor.

04:01.752 --> 04:04.119
Let me guess: with a gun
still in her hand.

04:04.121 --> 04:06.388
The same gun he used
to jam down her throat,

04:06.390 --> 04:08.157
when he wasn't beating her,
drugging her,

04:08.159 --> 04:10.025
or cheating on her.

04:10.027 --> 04:11.860
That night, he kept going on
about how

04:11.862 --> 04:14.096
he was gonna kill her
and her teenage son.

04:14.098 --> 04:15.658
He grabbed his gun;
there was a scuffle.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.534
And, for once, Rose
came out on top.

04:19.536 --> 04:20.869
Yeah, but she
had no priors.

04:20.870 --> 04:22.537
I mean, she was
a model citizen.

04:22.539 --> 04:24.039
This was the most
clear-cut case

04:24.041 --> 04:25.474
of self-defense
there ever was.

04:25.476 --> 04:27.442
Did you tell the DA?

04:27.444 --> 04:29.144
DA wanted to win
desperately,

04:29.146 --> 04:30.579
and the judge was an ass,

04:30.581 --> 04:32.147
who didn't buy the
self-defense aspect,

04:32.149 --> 04:34.182
because Rose never made
an official complaint

04:34.184 --> 04:35.817
with the police.

04:37.286 --> 04:39.287
No, read the letters
for yourself.

04:39.289 --> 04:40.889
She wrote to you from prison?

04:40.891 --> 04:43.792
She pleaded with me to look
after her teenage son Eric,

04:43.794 --> 04:45.060
after she got locked up.

04:45.062 --> 04:46.094
Now let's look
through those,

04:46.096 --> 04:47.195
and see if there's
any clues

04:47.197 --> 04:48.563
as to where
she might be headed.

04:48.565 --> 04:50.932
I'll be figuring that out,
thank you very much.

04:50.934 --> 04:52.667
Morgan.

04:52.669 --> 04:54.469
Can't say we're happy
to see your face.

04:54.471 --> 04:56.071
You don't see me
smiling, either.

04:56.073 --> 04:58.106
What's the Marshals Service
doing here?

04:58.108 --> 04:59.374
We're here
to make sure you locals

04:59.376 --> 05:00.475
don't screw up this manhunt.

05:00.477 --> 05:01.476
It's a womanhunt.

05:01.478 --> 05:02.410
Oh...

05:02.412 --> 05:04.012
you added humor
to you skill set.

05:04.014 --> 05:06.548
You may want to try adding
something to your skill set.

05:06.550 --> 05:08.450
You might want to try to explain

05:08.452 --> 05:11.152
why looking over the visitor's
log of an escaped murderer,

05:11.154 --> 05:13.021
I find your name,
listed a dozen times.

05:13.023 --> 05:16.224
He put Rose Butler away.
Really?

05:16.226 --> 05:17.425
And then dropped by to do what,

05:17.427 --> 05:19.294
design window treatments
for her cell?

05:19.296 --> 05:20.895
She was a friend.

05:20.897 --> 05:22.664
How good of friends?

05:22.666 --> 05:24.132
'Cause, you know, sometimes
friends help friends

05:24.134 --> 05:25.300
bust out of prison.

05:25.302 --> 05:27.135
That's almost as funny
as your face, Morgan.

05:27.137 --> 05:28.770
Which is really
saying something.

05:28.772 --> 05:30.805
Well, let's find us
a quiet place to talk,

05:30.807 --> 05:33.007
and we'll find out
who the funny guy is.

Okay, but if you want to do
the thing in Connecticut,

06:06.683 --> 06:09.050
I'm gonna have to cancel you
for the thing in Maryland.

06:09.052 --> 06:11.152
Almost like I planned it
that way.

06:11.154 --> 06:14.689
How are we feeling about
Sergeant Delgado's JuviStat program?

06:14.691 --> 06:18.025
Well, if his numbers hold up,
I'd say it's a slam dunk.

06:18.027 --> 06:20.161
Great minds think alike.

06:20.163 --> 06:22.096
And I think we should let him
take the lead on it.

06:22.098 --> 06:23.231
Seriously.

06:23.233 --> 06:24.298
It's his idea.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.434
And if you taught me
anything over the years...

06:26.436 --> 06:27.301
If?

06:27.303 --> 06:28.436
If... you've taught me

06:28.438 --> 06:29.937
anything over the years,

06:29.939 --> 06:32.373
it's having the right face
saying the right things,

06:32.375 --> 06:34.342
so the public hears it
the right way.

06:34.344 --> 06:35.943
All right. I'll put him
front and center,

06:35.945 --> 06:37.979
and start crafting
the press release.

06:39.414 --> 06:40.915
What's up with Sid?

06:40.917 --> 06:42.917
You noticed.

06:42.919 --> 06:44.151
Hard to miss.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.386
And there's some talk that

06:45.388 --> 06:46.754
he's been bunking
in his office, too.

06:46.756 --> 06:49.356
You want me to
find out why?

06:49.358 --> 06:51.092
No.

06:51.094 --> 06:52.159
I'm just asking.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.761
Just answering.

06:55.363 --> 06:59.233
CHRISSIE: Help CSC
dismantle the patriarchy!

06:59.235 --> 07:00.534
Be a part of the solution!

07:00.536 --> 07:01.669
Ladies, we're so deep in it,

07:01.671 --> 07:03.003
we don't even
realize it anymore.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.972
Come on, don't be a part
of the problem.

07:04.974 --> 07:07.341
Hi! Join!
Make a difference!

07:07.343 --> 07:09.276
Chrissie!

07:09.278 --> 07:10.711
Nicky.

07:10.713 --> 07:11.745
I thought you went to class.

07:11.747 --> 07:12.880
I wanted you to meet
my uncle Jamie

07:12.882 --> 07:13.814
and his partner Eddie.

07:13.816 --> 07:14.815
Hey.
Hi.

07:14.817 --> 07:16.817
They're officers with
the NYPD.

07:17.685 --> 07:19.319
Your uncle's a cop?

07:20.288 --> 07:21.822
Wait'll she finds out
who your grandpa is.

07:21.824 --> 07:24.725
Yeah, we're, uh,
off-duty right now.

07:24.727 --> 07:27.594
Like Clark Kent before he
ducks into the phone booth.

07:27.596 --> 07:29.763
It's just... you never
mentioned...

07:29.765 --> 07:32.532
you were related
to any of... them.

07:32.534 --> 07:33.901
I could tell how upset you were

07:33.903 --> 07:35.669
after Campus Security
blew you off.

07:35.671 --> 07:37.804
Figured I'd try to help.

07:39.007 --> 07:41.127
Nicky tells me you've been
having some trouble online?

07:42.443 --> 07:44.811
I fight for social justice.

07:44.813 --> 07:47.180
Someone's not
happy about it.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.451
My niece tells me that you've
gotten some death threats.

07:51.453 --> 07:53.253
Maybe not technically, but...

07:53.255 --> 07:55.856
she shouldn't be attacked
for speaking out.

07:55.858 --> 07:57.023
Unfortunately, none of this is

07:57.025 --> 07:58.859
rising to the level of
aggravated harassment.

07:58.861 --> 08:01.328
Not to mention, what they wrote
was posted anonymously.

08:01.330 --> 08:02.729
I know who it is.

08:02.731 --> 08:03.830
You do?

08:03.832 --> 08:05.665
A frat guy named Scott Keller.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.901
Two days ago,
we got in this huge fight

08:07.903 --> 08:09.002
in our Poli Sci class.

08:09.004 --> 08:10.503
I said the legal system is

08:10.505 --> 08:12.605
biased against
transgender people,

08:12.607 --> 08:14.374
and he started yelling,
"Blah, blah-blah, blah,

08:14.376 --> 08:15.909
blah, blah!" to my face,

08:15.911 --> 08:17.544
and saying
loudmouth liberals like me

08:17.546 --> 08:20.046
are ruining this country.

08:20.048 --> 08:22.081
If there hadn't been
30 students there,

08:22.083 --> 08:23.817
I think he would've
strangled me.

08:23.819 --> 08:25.452
And you informed
Campus Security.

08:25.454 --> 08:28.755
I tried to, this morning,
but the guy shut me down.

08:28.757 --> 08:30.690
Typical white cis male.

08:34.028 --> 08:36.361
O-Okay, we'll...
we'll talk to Scott,

08:36.364 --> 08:39.432
run his name and... see if he's
had any brushes with the law.

08:39.433 --> 08:41.034
Thanks.

08:41.835 --> 08:43.102
Thank you.

08:46.607 --> 08:47.974
Never give up.

08:47.976 --> 08:50.209
That's what CSC is
all about, right?

08:52.946 --> 08:54.413
Eric, this is Danny Reagan.

08:54.415 --> 08:55.615
I'm sure, by now, you heard

08:55.617 --> 08:58.551
that your mom escaped
from Bethany Correctional.

08:58.553 --> 09:00.520
I want you to give me a call
on my cell phone, okay?

09:00.522 --> 09:01.721
If you don't get me,
leave a message,

09:01.723 --> 09:04.023
or try the hotline
that they set up.

09:04.025 --> 09:06.525
You call there, they'll put you
through to me directly, okay?

09:06.527 --> 09:08.628
Talk to you soon.

09:08.630 --> 09:10.596
MORGAN: ...extend the roadblock
ten miles north and south

09:10.598 --> 09:12.298
on 22 and 684.

09:12.300 --> 09:15.501
And I want every PD between
Jersey and Connecticut

09:15.503 --> 09:19.338
with dogs and choppers off their
asses and on the hunt.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.974
You heard from Rose's son?
Not yet.

09:21.976 --> 09:22.908
Well, give me an address.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.009
I'll put marshals on his place.

09:24.011 --> 09:25.277
Don't you think,
if I had an address,

09:25.279 --> 09:26.612
I'd be on my way there
already?

09:26.614 --> 09:27.880
I thought you were
tight with him,

09:27.882 --> 09:29.248
like you are with
his jailbird mommy?

09:29.250 --> 09:31.851
I took him to a few Mets
games when he was a kid,

09:31.853 --> 09:34.186
he turned 18, he wanted
to be close to his mother,

09:34.188 --> 09:36.121
so he moved up
near the prison.

09:36.123 --> 09:37.156
That's the last
I heard from him.

09:37.158 --> 09:38.857
You lost touch,
like you did with Rose.

09:38.859 --> 09:41.627
The last letter she wrote you
was dated over a year ago.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.762
She just dropped out of contact.

09:43.764 --> 09:45.664
Cut me off
the visitors' list, too.

09:45.666 --> 09:47.599
And you don't know why?

09:47.601 --> 09:48.534
No, I don't know why.

09:48.536 --> 09:50.135
You're the genius;
you tell me.

09:50.137 --> 09:51.470
Oh, so that's a no.

09:52.439 --> 09:54.072
Is there anything in here
that she says

09:54.074 --> 09:56.308
about where she might
want to go if she gets out?

09:56.310 --> 09:58.143
No, she just says,
over and over,

09:58.145 --> 09:59.645
how she shouldn't have
gone to prison.

09:59.647 --> 10:01.513
Same sob story, man or woman.

10:01.515 --> 10:04.416
Well, except, in Rose's case,
she didn't deserve to go.

10:04.418 --> 10:06.685
And that guard who got
attacked this morning,

10:06.687 --> 10:08.987
he didn't deserve get shanked
with a garden spade!

10:08.989 --> 10:11.890
How the hell do you know it was
Rose who shanked the guard?

10:11.892 --> 10:13.792
What do we know about
the other escapee?

10:13.794 --> 10:16.361
Trina Hamilton.

10:16.363 --> 10:18.663
Sheet stretches into her teens.

10:18.665 --> 10:21.833
She used to run a smack lab
in Washington Heights,

10:21.835 --> 10:22.901
then she got hooked,

10:22.903 --> 10:24.736
murdered and dismembered
a runner on her crew

10:24.738 --> 10:27.239
that she thought was
ripping her off.

10:27.241 --> 10:28.573
Sentenced to Bethany
Correctional,

10:28.575 --> 10:30.575
became Rose's cell mate
last October.

10:30.577 --> 10:32.177
October.
Yeah.

10:32.179 --> 10:34.346
Right around the time
Rose stopped writing me.

10:34.348 --> 10:37.382
So is it possible, then, that
Trina came into the joint,

10:37.384 --> 10:39.451
turned Rose, she cuts off
the outside world

10:39.453 --> 10:41.152
and becomes Trina's flunky?

10:42.321 --> 10:45.190
Are you ever gonna stop playing
the violin for this woman?

10:45.192 --> 10:47.092
Rose would've done
anything in the world

10:47.094 --> 10:49.060
to get out of the joint
and be back with her son.

10:49.062 --> 10:50.261
Anything!

10:50.263 --> 10:52.831
Including teaming up with
a maniac like Trina!

10:54.733 --> 10:56.401
We got a sighting.

11:07.546 --> 11:11.082
I didn't get to congratulate you
for bringing Delgado in.

11:11.084 --> 11:13.184
Nothing due my way.

11:13.186 --> 11:14.585
Your guy did good.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.454
We're going with him.

11:16.456 --> 11:18.823
As if he needs a bigger head?
(chuckles)

11:18.825 --> 11:22.160
You know, this floor
isn't zoned for residency.

11:22.162 --> 11:24.128
Sir?

11:24.130 --> 11:27.432
So sleeping on the couch
for more than, say, a night,

11:27.434 --> 11:28.733
that'd be breaking the law,
technically.

11:28.735 --> 11:31.235
Oh, yeah, well, I'm, uh...

11:31.237 --> 11:32.270
How many nights?

11:32.272 --> 11:33.738
(sighs)

11:33.740 --> 11:36.073
Just a couple.

11:36.075 --> 11:39.377
Anything you want to talk about?

11:39.379 --> 11:41.579
Nothing you want to hear.

11:46.151 --> 11:48.319
That's not what I asked, Sid.

11:50.756 --> 11:52.323
Just, uh, (sniffs)

11:52.325 --> 11:54.792
a little trouble at home.

11:54.794 --> 11:56.961
(sighs)

11:58.263 --> 12:00.064
You and Sheila?

12:00.066 --> 12:03.033
She...

12:03.035 --> 12:05.669
Well...

12:05.671 --> 12:07.438
There's someone else.

12:09.975 --> 12:11.108
She tell you this?

12:11.110 --> 12:14.478
No, but I saw some texts
on her phone.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.213
And you're sure they were...
One was about

12:16.215 --> 12:17.915
figuring out
where they could meet

12:17.917 --> 12:21.819
and what they were gonna
get up to when they did.

12:21.821 --> 12:24.154
Then he texted her
he was, quote,

12:24.156 --> 12:25.823
"EOT

12:25.825 --> 12:28.759
at 2200 hours," unquote.

12:28.761 --> 12:30.561
So he's a cop.

12:30.563 --> 12:31.528
Yeah.

12:31.530 --> 12:32.729
You have a name?

12:32.731 --> 12:34.198
Not till just this morning,

12:34.200 --> 12:35.699
when he said,

12:35.701 --> 12:38.602
"Something lights me,
I'm all over it."

12:38.604 --> 12:42.339
He texted the same exact message
to Sheila.

12:42.341 --> 12:44.675
Must be like his motto

12:44.677 --> 12:47.044
when it comes to him
getting what he wants.

12:47.046 --> 12:48.278
Well, that doesn't prove squat.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.247
And last week, I come home,

12:50.249 --> 12:51.648
Delgado's there with Sheila.

12:51.650 --> 12:53.316
Says he was looking for me.

12:53.318 --> 12:54.918
And I thought to myself,

12:54.920 --> 12:56.586
"Well, you know where I am.

12:56.588 --> 12:59.656
Ninth floor, One PP,
all day long."

12:59.658 --> 13:01.758
You take a guy under your wing,

13:01.760 --> 13:03.093
and he stabs you in the back?

13:03.095 --> 13:04.528
Slow down.
Boss, I've earned

13:04.530 --> 13:06.496
my stripes, all right?

13:06.498 --> 13:08.398
You pinned these bars
on me yourself.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.201
And just the thought of seeing
that son of a bitch

13:11.203 --> 13:14.337
strutting around up here...

13:14.339 --> 13:16.473
or me being tasked
to help him out

13:16.475 --> 13:19.909
with his stupid
JuviStat program!

13:19.911 --> 13:22.979
I mean, there's some things
I'm just not gonna put up with!

13:25.249 --> 13:27.584
All right? Either he goes,

13:27.586 --> 13:30.653
or I do.

13:32.823 --> 13:35.558
To give advice and opinion.

13:37.094 --> 13:39.862
That's your job.

13:39.864 --> 13:42.665
What is not your job

13:42.667 --> 13:45.668
is to give ultimatums.

13:45.670 --> 13:47.870
You need to think about that.

13:51.241 --> 13:53.276
(door closes)

13:53.278 --> 13:56.579
(sighs)

13:56.581 --> 13:59.282
OFFICER: This is a gas station
near the Saw Mill River Parkway.

13:59.284 --> 14:01.484
That's due west of the prison.

14:01.486 --> 14:06.556
Must have travelled by foot
through the woods.

14:07.958 --> 14:10.226
See that? Trina's
the ringleader.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.929
Ooh!

14:12.931 --> 14:15.965
And she's
a complete maniac.

14:15.967 --> 14:17.733
Look at her,
she's pouring gas on the guy.

14:17.735 --> 14:19.268
Where did Rose go?

14:19.270 --> 14:21.637
Attendant said she ran in
asking for a map.

14:21.639 --> 14:23.706
When he turned to get one,
she reached over the counter

14:23.708 --> 14:25.708
and grabbed a .45
he keeps there.

14:25.710 --> 14:27.843
Threatened to shoot him
if he gave chase.

14:29.045 --> 14:31.213
You still think
Rose Butler's an angel?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.020
Get a screen-grab of that SUV
and its plates

14:48.022 --> 14:49.488
and get the governor's office
on the horn.

14:49.490 --> 14:51.723
I'll brief him in the car.
We're headed out.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.058
You get any word
from Rose's son,

14:53.060 --> 14:54.893
I want to hear about it
before you even think

14:54.895 --> 14:56.028
about acting on it.

14:56.030 --> 14:57.462
Aye, aye, skipper.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.097
Great.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.133
Hey, I...

15:02.435 --> 15:03.669
What do you got?

15:03.671 --> 15:05.470
Con Ed just got back to me
with an address

15:05.472 --> 15:08.206
for Eric's apartment
six miles from the prison.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.008
Beautiful. Keep it on the QT.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.210
Now we're withholding
information

15:12.212 --> 15:13.512
from the US Marshals Service?

15:13.514 --> 15:14.780
Listen,

15:14.782 --> 15:16.681
if Morgan finds Rose
before we do,

15:16.683 --> 15:18.817
she's gonna do harder time than
she would have done before,

15:18.819 --> 15:21.086
that's if she doesn't die
in a hail of gunfire.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.355
Danny, they're Feds.
Exactly,

15:23.357 --> 15:24.222
and while they're running around

15:24.224 --> 15:25.557
big-footing the
rest of the world,

15:25.559 --> 15:27.359
we are going to save
Eric's mom's life.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.693
Come on.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.402
Your uncle didn't arrest Scott?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.537
He said his record is clean.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.539
So typical.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.109
The people in power never
protect the less powerful.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.444
That's not true, Chrissie.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.847
Have you watched
the news lately?

15:48.849 --> 15:51.983
Tell me the NYPD
are the good guys.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.519
The good things cops do
rarely make the news.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.454
Look, maybe my uncle's right.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.956
You're not really in danger.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.959
Now you're blowing me off, too?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.927
Ok, but...

16:02.929 --> 16:04.829
Look, if someone hates you
so much,

16:04.831 --> 16:06.464
have you thought about maybe,
I don't know,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.266
keeping a lower profile
for a little while?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.935
Nicky, they want
to shut people like us up.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.538
Are you willing to
keep "a low profile"

16:13.540 --> 16:16.140
when you see injustice,

16:16.142 --> 16:17.775
income inequality,

16:17.777 --> 16:20.378
attacks on gay rights?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.213
Well, no.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.916
Neither am I.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.984
So we keep fighting, right?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.186
Right.

16:32.457 --> 16:34.558
Isn't that your room?

16:42.968 --> 16:45.336
Oh, my God.

16:50.141 --> 16:52.109
See?

16:52.111 --> 16:55.613
Someone does want me dead.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.198
Detective Reagan.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.531
Eric, where you been?

17:15.534 --> 17:16.700
I left you a voicemail.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.702
Yeah, yeah, no, right, sorry,
I was at work.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.938
Boss gets real pissed
if we even look at our phones.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.973
Do you mind if we come in?
Yeah, of course.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.842
So, did my mom really
break out of jail?

17:25.844 --> 17:28.345
Unfortunately, she did.

17:30.748 --> 17:32.482
She contact you?

17:32.484 --> 17:33.817
No.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.519
What about the last time
you visited her?

17:35.521 --> 17:38.889
She say anything weird like,
"I'll be seeing you real soon"?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.624
No.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.059
No, but honestly,

17:42.061 --> 17:44.361
she's-she's barely even
my mom anymore.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.997
I used to visit every Sunday,
but, um,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.899
the past year,
every time I show up,

17:48.901 --> 17:51.168
it's like she'd be too scared
to even talk to me.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.769
Well, we think
that's when she got a new,

17:52.771 --> 17:54.504
not-so-nice cell mate.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.172
(sighs) My God.

17:56.174 --> 17:58.341
Still into, uh,
computers and electronics,

17:58.343 --> 17:59.876
I see, huh?

17:59.878 --> 18:01.344
Eric's a real whiz kid.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.880
He had a full ride to, uh, NYU.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.116
Yeah, now I'm making
minimum wage

18:06.118 --> 18:08.785
fixing people's computers
when their cats pee on them,

18:08.787 --> 18:10.620
but I had to move here

18:10.622 --> 18:14.357
to be closer to my mom.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.192
Well, she's lucky
to have a son like you.

18:17.528 --> 18:20.697
Any idea where your mom
might have gone, Eric?

18:22.566 --> 18:24.667
I don't know.

18:28.939 --> 18:31.541
We're friends, you and I,
aren't we, Eric?

18:31.543 --> 18:32.909
Yeah.

18:32.911 --> 18:35.044
I mean, I've always been honest
with you?

18:35.046 --> 18:36.479
Yeah, yeah, no, totally.

18:36.481 --> 18:38.181
So why the hell you lying to me?

18:38.183 --> 18:39.882
What?

18:39.884 --> 18:43.052
Somebody ordered
Chinese food for three,

18:43.054 --> 18:45.421
not just one.

18:45.423 --> 18:47.557
Still warm.

18:47.559 --> 18:50.927
Your mom and Trina come over
for dinner, maybe?

18:51.595 --> 18:52.662
No, no, I was just hungry.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.298
And getting directions.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.601
Hey! Come here!

18:58.603 --> 19:00.202
Hey!

19:01.805 --> 19:02.772
He locked it.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.607
Unlock the computer.

19:04.609 --> 19:05.775
Tell us where they're headed.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.877
Unlock it.
I can't do that.

19:08.879 --> 19:10.046
Unlock the computer

19:10.048 --> 19:11.180
or I'm gonna take you
in for hindering.

19:11.182 --> 19:12.648
You just want to try
and send her back!

19:12.650 --> 19:14.717
Hey, I'm trying to
help you and her.

19:14.719 --> 19:17.052
You better hope he finds her
before someone else does.

19:17.054 --> 19:19.688
If he would've helped her
like he promised,

19:19.690 --> 19:22.024
she wouldn't even be in prison
in the first place.

19:22.026 --> 19:23.759
Okay, yeah, well,
suit yourself.

19:23.761 --> 19:25.227
Get up against the wall.

19:25.229 --> 19:28.130
(handcuffs clicking)

19:30.967 --> 19:32.301
Trey Delgado?

19:32.303 --> 19:33.836
Yeah.

19:33.838 --> 19:34.903
He knows this?

19:34.905 --> 19:36.805
He thinks he knows
and has no proof.

19:36.807 --> 19:39.341
But at this point,
proof isn't the point.

19:39.343 --> 19:41.009
No, he's calling
for Delgado's head.

19:41.011 --> 19:42.344
You can't fire Delgado.

19:42.346 --> 19:43.479
As far as I'm concerned,

19:43.481 --> 19:45.013
it is a personal matter,

19:45.015 --> 19:46.782
and JuviStat is a done deal,

19:46.784 --> 19:48.584
but Sid does not see it
that way.

19:48.586 --> 19:50.786
He sees it as "it's him or me."

19:50.788 --> 19:51.920
He said that?

19:51.922 --> 19:53.188
Exactly that.

19:53.190 --> 19:55.023
All right,

19:55.025 --> 19:57.993
in situations like this,
a guy kinda loses it,

19:57.995 --> 20:01.396
and Sid's a trusted colleague
and a valuable counsel.

20:01.398 --> 20:04.566
No one on my staff gives me
an ultimatum.

20:04.568 --> 20:06.301
You're gonna have to take
a step back, too.

20:06.303 --> 20:07.836
I can take a hundred steps back.

20:07.838 --> 20:09.304
It does not change what he said.

20:09.306 --> 20:10.605
What are you gonna do?

20:10.607 --> 20:12.541
I don't know.

20:12.543 --> 20:14.976
What are you gonna do?

20:14.978 --> 20:16.545
Me?
Oh, come on.

20:16.547 --> 20:19.214
I know you have people
that I don't know about.

20:19.216 --> 20:21.616
Is that a question?
No.

20:21.618 --> 20:23.251
It's okay. You're supposed to.

20:23.253 --> 20:25.020
People you can't do
your job without,

20:25.022 --> 20:27.289
but you wouldn't be
caught dead with.

20:27.291 --> 20:28.790
See if you can find
the what's what

20:28.792 --> 20:29.958
and the who's who in this.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.061
If I could--
and I'm not saying that I can-

20:33.063 --> 20:34.229
to what end?

20:34.231 --> 20:36.131
(sighs)

20:36.133 --> 20:38.833
To see who gets to stay
and who has to go.

20:48.711 --> 20:50.311
I only want what's best
for your mom,

20:50.313 --> 20:52.413
and if you do, you'll tell me
where she's headed.

20:52.415 --> 20:54.716
You can get out of here,
no harm, no foul.

20:54.718 --> 20:57.418
Why don't you go to hell.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.521
Enjoy the accommodations.

21:02.024 --> 21:03.258
Hey.
Hey.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.592
Still won't talk?

21:04.594 --> 21:06.561
Not yet. What
about the laptop?

21:06.563 --> 21:08.529
CCS is working to break
the encryption.

21:08.531 --> 21:10.732
I heard the marshals rousted
Trina's old drug pals,

21:10.734 --> 21:12.533
but she hasn't (phone rings)
contacted anyone yet.

21:12.535 --> 21:13.868
Great, so we got squat.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.136
Reagan.

21:15.138 --> 21:16.571
ROSE:
Danny?

21:16.573 --> 21:18.539
Rose?

21:18.541 --> 21:20.508
I know you must be one
of the people trying to find me.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.677
I am, 'cause I'm worried
about you.

21:22.679 --> 21:25.546
st Sp. All of you,
just-just leave me alone.

21:25.548 --> 21:27.215
You know I can't do that.

21:27.217 --> 21:28.783
And you know
I don't belong in prison.

21:28.785 --> 21:31.185
Just get away from Trina, okay?
Tell her you got to

21:31.187 --> 21:33.588
get something from your
apartment in Kips Bay, okay?

21:33.590 --> 21:35.456
You go there,
I'll meet you there,

21:35.458 --> 21:37.458
and I promise you,

21:37.460 --> 21:39.360
I'll make sure
you're treated right this time.

21:39.362 --> 21:42.163
I found another car
we can drive.

21:42.165 --> 21:43.164
What the hell are you doing?

21:43.166 --> 21:45.633
Rose, you got
to get away from her.

21:45.635 --> 21:46.767
TRINA: You stupid bitch!

21:46.769 --> 21:48.803
Give me that!

21:48.805 --> 21:51.338
Sorry, T, I'm sorry.

21:51.340 --> 21:53.374
I'm sorry, T, I'm sorry.
Get out of the car!

21:53.376 --> 21:54.842
Rose?

21:54.844 --> 21:57.178
I'm sorry!
Rose!

21:57.180 --> 21:58.812
They're switching cars.

21:58.814 --> 22:00.414
We got to figure out
where they're headed.

22:00.416 --> 22:03.150
We got to hope she's alive
by the time we get there.

22:16.151 --> 22:17.451
Knock, knock.

22:17.453 --> 22:19.687
Hey, come see this.

22:19.689 --> 22:21.822
Is that the video
from Chrissie's building?

22:21.824 --> 22:24.725
Still can't believe
the landlord gave it to you.

22:24.727 --> 22:26.994
Well, get ready
to not believe something else.

22:26.996 --> 22:27.962
What do you mean?

22:27.964 --> 22:29.630
Just watch.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.468
God, what a bastard.

22:34.470 --> 22:36.370
Sorry.
Gets worse.

22:39.641 --> 22:41.842
(gasps)

22:41.844 --> 22:44.044
It was... Chrissie?

22:44.046 --> 22:45.479
Time code shows
that she did it

22:45.481 --> 22:49.049
about a minute before she
bumped into you on the street.

22:49.051 --> 22:51.351
But...

22:51.353 --> 22:53.320
It can't be her.

22:53.322 --> 22:55.289
I gave it to campus security.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.191
Now they think
she posted the online threats.

22:58.193 --> 23:00.861
Why would she do this?

23:00.863 --> 23:02.996
I don't know.

23:02.998 --> 23:04.931
But she lied to Uncle Jamie.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.967
I mean, that's a crime, right?

23:06.969 --> 23:09.469
Yes, but I don't think anyone
wants to press charges.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.205
I mean, something like this
could ruin Chrissie for life.

23:12.207 --> 23:14.441
Even the landlord
was trying to protect her.

23:14.443 --> 23:16.443
Mom, she was having us
organize a candle-light march

23:16.445 --> 23:19.079
to protest whoever
was trying to kill her.

23:19.081 --> 23:21.114
I know, and the university's
gonna call her in,

23:21.116 --> 23:23.016
and she's gonna have
to cancel it.

23:23.018 --> 23:25.719
(quiet laugh)

23:25.721 --> 23:27.754
I'm sorry, Nicky.

23:34.829 --> 23:36.997
(sighs)

23:39.800 --> 23:41.201
Rolls are terrific.

23:41.203 --> 23:42.736
Thanks to whoever made them.

23:42.738 --> 23:44.070
That be me.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.406
So, now going to the bakery
counts as making something?

23:46.408 --> 23:48.007
Pops, he burned you.

23:48.009 --> 23:51.778
Yeah, and got cut out of my will
in one fell swoop.

23:51.780 --> 23:54.447
Well, I'm a fan, Gramps,
so I'm gonna have a second.

23:54.449 --> 23:55.582
Or a third.
Who's counting?

23:55.584 --> 23:56.716
LINDA:
I'm just saying

23:56.718 --> 23:58.918
that three rolls

23:58.920 --> 24:00.620
to, like,
every one string bean

24:00.622 --> 24:02.789
is not a healthy ratio.

24:02.791 --> 24:04.657
Yeah, Dad, too many bad carbs.

24:04.659 --> 24:05.792
What's a good carb?

24:05.794 --> 24:07.193
Like Mom said, string beans.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.595
Okay, well then, can you
pass the string beans,

24:09.597 --> 24:10.863
please, Nicky?

24:10.865 --> 24:12.165
FRANK:
Come on, Nicky,

24:12.167 --> 24:13.966
let someone else
get a word in.

24:13.968 --> 24:14.967
I'm fine.

24:14.969 --> 24:16.803
Once more
like you mean it.

24:16.805 --> 24:19.605
A friend at Columbia turned out
to be not so much of a friend.

24:19.607 --> 24:20.907
She betrayed me.

24:20.909 --> 24:22.909
After I got Mom involved
and Uncle Jamie.

24:22.911 --> 24:25.244
Don't worry
about us, Nicky.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.747
But when you got more skin
in the game, it hurts more.

24:27.749 --> 24:28.881
I hear you, kiddo.

24:28.883 --> 24:30.349
And I get that
in the real world,

24:30.351 --> 24:31.417
you got to expect it, right?

24:31.419 --> 24:32.652
You're gonna be betrayed

24:32.654 --> 24:33.986
because it's
every man for himself.

24:33.988 --> 24:35.988
But this is at college,
you know?

24:35.990 --> 24:38.457
Over values and principles.

24:38.459 --> 24:40.926
Are you sure this person
meant to betray you?

24:42.429 --> 24:44.296
I mean, sometimes people
have good intentions,

24:44.298 --> 24:47.299
they just don't get around
to keeping the promises.

24:47.301 --> 24:49.435
Well, next time,
I'm gonna think long and hard

24:49.437 --> 24:51.804
before jumping in
to help somebody.

24:51.806 --> 24:53.239
Well, you can't do that.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.673
Maybe not if you're a cop.

24:54.675 --> 24:55.975
But I'm not a cop.

24:55.977 --> 24:57.443
No, but you're good people.

24:57.445 --> 24:59.245
And good people try
to move on from a betrayal

24:59.247 --> 25:02.181
like it's an exception,
not the rule.

25:02.183 --> 25:05.317
Well, you're better people
than I am, I guess.

25:05.319 --> 25:06.685
Not at all.

25:06.687 --> 25:08.954
And you start walking around
like you're questioning

25:08.956 --> 25:10.556
everybody's motives
all the time,

25:10.558 --> 25:12.057
you're gonna end up
with a waiter

25:12.059 --> 25:14.560
and a couple of cats
for your circle of friends.

25:14.562 --> 25:15.794
Dad's right.

25:15.796 --> 25:17.029
You look around this table,

25:17.031 --> 25:18.797
we've hurt each other
over the years.

25:18.799 --> 25:20.165
If we gave up on each other,

25:20.167 --> 25:21.834
where would we be?

25:21.836 --> 25:23.468
Not eating dinner together
every week.

25:23.470 --> 25:24.503
Amen to that.

25:24.505 --> 25:26.004
Yeah, but this is family.

25:26.006 --> 25:28.407
It doesn't necessarily guarantee
no one gets hurt.

25:28.409 --> 25:30.442
Or forgives and forgets.

25:30.444 --> 25:32.678
Right.
We try at it.

25:42.555 --> 25:44.556
(pop music playing, muffled)

25:45.491 --> 25:47.692
Chrissie, open up!

25:48.661 --> 25:50.128
Chrissie,
I know you're in there!

25:50.130 --> 25:52.364
Answer me!

25:52.366 --> 25:55.600
Chrissie, you owe me
an explanation!

26:05.978 --> 26:07.312
Oh, my God.

26:07.314 --> 26:09.381
Somebody call 911!

26:09.383 --> 26:11.583
Chrissie?

26:11.585 --> 26:14.152
Wake up!

26:18.791 --> 26:22.260
Yeah, all right.
Thanks anyway.

26:22.262 --> 26:23.661
That was CCS.

26:23.663 --> 26:25.129
The kid fried his computer.

26:25.131 --> 26:26.431
We're screwed.
Not quite.

26:26.433 --> 26:28.032
I had the phone
company trace a signal

26:28.034 --> 26:30.668
on that disposable phone
Rose called you on.

26:30.670 --> 26:32.604
The state trooper found it
on the street up in Armonk.

26:32.606 --> 26:33.771
Wait a minute.

26:33.773 --> 26:35.707
They're heading to the city.

26:35.709 --> 26:36.975
Maybe we're not screwed.

26:36.977 --> 26:39.310
You think she's heading
to Kips Bay like you suggested?

26:39.312 --> 26:41.612
We'll have a car sit on
the house and we'll find out.

26:41.614 --> 26:43.047
Detectives!

26:43.049 --> 26:44.248
Okay, now we're screwed.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.684
You hauled in Rose's kid
without telling me?

26:46.686 --> 26:48.619
I don't know
if you got the memo.

26:48.621 --> 26:49.720
But we don't work for you.

26:49.722 --> 26:50.721
Well, that's obvious,

26:50.723 --> 26:52.390
because the people for me
get results.

26:52.392 --> 26:54.258
Relax, we got a beat
on Rose and Trina.

26:54.260 --> 26:55.693
They're headed south.

26:55.695 --> 26:56.961
Yeah, I know.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.162
They just robbed
and pistol-whipped

26:58.164 --> 26:59.497
a bodega owner in Yonkers.

26:59.499 --> 27:00.598
Open up your cage.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.666
Eric's going with me.

27:01.668 --> 27:03.067
Wait a minute, hold on.

27:03.069 --> 27:05.303
You got a Federal writ?

27:05.305 --> 27:06.804
I got two murderers
running wild,

27:06.806 --> 27:08.439
hurting people every
which way they turn.

27:08.441 --> 27:10.875
You give me five minutes
in a real lockup with me,

27:10.877 --> 27:12.576
I'll get everything
this kid knows,

27:12.578 --> 27:13.944
whether you can or not.

27:13.946 --> 27:15.446
That kid's gonna talk,
all right?

27:15.448 --> 27:16.747
He's just trying to protect

27:16.749 --> 27:18.249
the only person
he's got left in the world.

27:18.251 --> 27:19.850
What is it with you Reagans?

27:19.852 --> 27:22.386
Scratch you or your sister
and out pops the bleeding heart!

27:22.388 --> 27:23.921
What's next?

27:23.923 --> 27:25.389
Your old man's gonna
confess he's secretly

27:25.391 --> 27:28.292
been teaching ballet
down at the ACLU?

27:29.494 --> 27:31.862
That kid is not gonna end up
in a zoo like his mother.

27:31.864 --> 27:33.497
End of discussion.

27:33.499 --> 27:34.965
That's not up to you.

27:34.967 --> 27:36.934
You're not putting
your hands on the kid!

27:36.936 --> 27:37.968
Get out of my way!

27:37.970 --> 27:39.336
Hey!
Hey!

27:39.338 --> 27:40.471
Knock it off!

27:40.473 --> 27:42.339
Knock it off!
Get off!

27:42.341 --> 27:44.341
Your partner attacked
a U.S. Marshal.

27:44.343 --> 27:45.709
You put your hands on me first.

27:45.711 --> 27:47.778
All right, back up,
both of you!

27:47.780 --> 27:50.848
Listen, maybe it is time
we turned the screws on the kid.

27:50.850 --> 27:52.216
What?

27:52.218 --> 27:53.784
You're gonna side
with this hump in our house?!

27:53.786 --> 27:55.352
I'm siding with whoever
gets us a solid lead

27:55.354 --> 27:57.621
into finding those convicts.

27:57.623 --> 27:59.890
Okay, you two want to put
the screws to the kid,

27:59.892 --> 28:02.960
you'll do it
when I'm finished with him.

28:10.501 --> 28:11.735
What do you got?

28:11.737 --> 28:13.937
Shut the door.

28:15.506 --> 28:17.074
What do you got?

28:17.076 --> 28:19.976
Sheila Gormley is not
cheating with Delgado.

28:21.512 --> 28:24.214
Good news.

28:24.216 --> 28:25.949
But she is cheating.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.122
Okay.

28:32.124 --> 28:34.324
Got to be another cop.

28:34.326 --> 28:35.859
Yes, but not one of ours.

28:35.861 --> 28:36.927
Okay.

28:36.929 --> 28:38.028
He's a guy out of--

28:38.030 --> 28:39.629
I don't want to know that name.

28:39.631 --> 28:41.831
Right.

28:44.368 --> 28:46.369
What do you tell Sid?

28:46.371 --> 28:49.239
What do I tell Sid?

28:49.241 --> 28:51.174
I don't want to tell him

28:51.176 --> 28:52.976
his wife isn't cheating
with his protégé,

28:52.978 --> 28:54.577
but she is cheating.

28:54.579 --> 28:58.248
It's like do you want to me to
shoot you with a .22 or a .44?

28:58.250 --> 28:59.716
Either way--

28:59.718 --> 29:01.918
Sid gets wounded.

29:06.890 --> 29:09.092
Open.

29:12.029 --> 29:13.496
Save it, Detective.

29:13.498 --> 29:15.131
Save what?

29:15.133 --> 29:18.067
The whole good cop speech
that you're about to give me.

29:18.069 --> 29:21.437
I wasn't a very good cop
when it comes to your mom.

29:21.439 --> 29:23.039
You failed.

29:23.041 --> 29:24.073
Okay, so I failed.

29:24.075 --> 29:26.242
Which is why the only way

29:26.244 --> 29:28.311
I can pull a win
out of this now, Eric, is you.

29:28.313 --> 29:30.046
I'm already doing exactly that.

29:30.048 --> 29:31.614
How so?

29:31.616 --> 29:32.949
By lying to me?

29:32.951 --> 29:34.383
By not telling me
where your mom's going?

29:34.385 --> 29:35.551
By shutting down your computer?

29:35.553 --> 29:36.485
Yes!

29:36.487 --> 29:38.220
She can't get away, Eric!

29:39.423 --> 29:40.723
And the longer this drags out,

29:40.725 --> 29:42.158
the more likely
it ends in bullets!

29:42.160 --> 29:44.093
You were never
our friend, okay!?

29:49.066 --> 29:51.767
Okay.

29:51.769 --> 29:54.637
Maybe I wasn't.

29:54.639 --> 29:56.839
But your mom's your friend.

29:56.841 --> 29:59.441
And if you don't
help me find her,

29:59.443 --> 30:01.377
you're never
gonna see her again.

30:01.379 --> 30:03.245
I'm just trying
to protect my mom.

30:03.247 --> 30:06.915
Like you couldn't protect
her from your stepdad?

30:06.917 --> 30:08.817
'use that's all
that's going on here.

30:08.819 --> 30:10.753
And you can
take it out on me

30:10.755 --> 30:12.421
all you want, Eric.

30:12.423 --> 30:15.324
But that's not gonna
get her back safe.

30:16.626 --> 30:18.794
Only you can do that.

30:20.563 --> 30:23.632
I'm asking you
to help me find her.

30:23.634 --> 30:25.901
At my apartment,

30:25.903 --> 30:29.438
I overheard Trina

30:29.440 --> 30:32.140
tell my mom that
right before she got busted,

30:32.142 --> 30:35.911
she was making a truce
with this old rival dealer,

30:35.913 --> 30:39.448
um... Rico.

30:39.450 --> 30:41.717
Said they would be safe
at Rico's 'cause...

30:41.719 --> 30:44.586
'cause nobody would think
she would go to an old enemy.

30:44.588 --> 30:46.855
You know, the cops wouldn't
look for her there, but...

30:46.857 --> 30:49.224
they just needed to find a way
to get to his place

30:49.226 --> 30:52.527
while staying off
of the main streets.

30:53.396 --> 30:55.931
(quietly):
Good.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.835
Open up.

31:02.004 --> 31:04.172
Will you please
just make sure she's okay?

31:04.174 --> 31:06.374
This time I will.

31:28.568 --> 31:29.829
MORGAN:
What do we got?

31:29.830 --> 31:31.996
Kid says Rose and
Trina are holed up

31:31.998 --> 31:33.832
in a drug spot up the
block-- 1280 Jancey.

31:33.834 --> 31:35.233
We scouted the area.

31:35.235 --> 31:36.768
No sign of the sedan they stole.

31:36.770 --> 31:37.902
So, this could be a end?

31:37.904 --> 31:39.904
Or it could <i> not</i>
be a dead end.

31:39.906 --> 31:41.406
Line it up!

31:41.408 --> 31:43.474
How exactly
do you want to do this?

31:43.476 --> 31:44.842
The marshal service
is gonna do this.

31:44.844 --> 31:46.911
You two are gonna
watch and learn.

31:49.448 --> 31:50.782
You heard the man.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.050
The marshals will handle it.

31:52.052 --> 31:53.751
The rest of us will
watch and learn.

31:56.655 --> 31:58.856
Hold.

32:09.334 --> 32:10.635
U.S. Marshal!

32:10.637 --> 32:11.769
Hands where we can see them!

32:11.771 --> 32:13.504
U.S. Marshal!

32:13.506 --> 32:15.940
(gunfire)

32:15.942 --> 32:18.075
Go! Go!

32:21.913 --> 32:23.948
I got you, I got you.

32:43.201 --> 32:45.469
Watch him.

32:54.012 --> 32:55.412
Drop it!

32:55.414 --> 32:57.448
Trina!

33:03.521 --> 33:05.789
♪ ♪

33:31.749 --> 33:34.618
Drop it!

33:38.189 --> 33:40.824
Danny?

33:40.826 --> 33:42.492
Right here.

33:44.695 --> 33:45.862
Where's Rose?

33:45.864 --> 33:46.930
We cleared the house.

33:46.932 --> 33:48.331
There's no sign of her.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.968
These dirtbags shot
two of my men.

33:51.970 --> 33:54.604
Oh, you know, we watched
and learned that on the way in.

33:54.606 --> 33:56.406
Yeah, well, if Rose puts up
a fight like this,

33:56.408 --> 33:57.874
she'll be deader than that one.

34:13.023 --> 34:15.358
Hey.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.328
Hey.

34:18.330 --> 34:19.996
You okay?

34:19.998 --> 34:22.699
Pretty far from okay.

34:22.701 --> 34:25.068
But you will be.

34:29.739 --> 34:32.375
My parents are flying
in from Florida.

34:32.377 --> 34:35.178
School wants me to go back
with them for a semester.

34:35.179 --> 34:37.446
Why'd you do it, Chrissie?

34:37.447 --> 34:41.317
I just... got caught up...

34:43.186 --> 34:45.554
...trying to fix what's
broken in the world.

34:45.556 --> 34:47.056
And that justifies lying?

34:47.058 --> 34:48.456
Of course not.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.793
(scoffs) I thought
I was your friend.

34:50.795 --> 34:52.962
You still are.

34:52.964 --> 34:54.563
If I was, you would
have come to me

34:54.565 --> 34:56.065
instead of trying
to kill yourself.

34:56.067 --> 34:59.068
Even after what I did?

35:00.937 --> 35:04.173
You don't have to be perfect.

35:04.175 --> 35:07.710
You just had to believe in me
as much as I believed in you.

35:09.613 --> 35:11.747
I'm really sorry, Nicky.

35:15.485 --> 35:17.519
You get better soon, okay?

35:17.521 --> 35:19.622
And call me.

35:19.624 --> 35:22.458
When you get back
next semester.

35:22.460 --> 35:25.461
I will.

35:25.463 --> 35:28.097
Good.

35:28.099 --> 35:30.632
'Cause we got a lot
of work to do.

35:39.375 --> 35:40.976
Hey, Reagan, I'm sorry.

35:40.978 --> 35:41.944
For what?

35:41.946 --> 35:43.345
For doubting you earlier.
(groans)

35:43.347 --> 35:45.047
I couldn't have
made Eric talk.

35:45.049 --> 35:46.615
Morgan sure as hell
couldn't have.

35:46.617 --> 35:48.650
Fat lot of good it did us
with Rose still in the wind.

35:48.652 --> 35:50.152
(cell phone rings)

35:50.154 --> 35:51.153
Reagan.

35:51.155 --> 35:52.688
I got away from her.

35:52.690 --> 35:54.623
Rose?

35:54.625 --> 35:55.957
Rose, where the hell are you?

35:55.959 --> 35:58.226
When we got to Rico's,
she made me the lookout,

35:58.228 --> 36:00.929
so I just drove off, and-and
then the car ran out of gas.

36:00.931 --> 36:01.930
All right, listen.

36:01.932 --> 36:03.532
I need you to focus, okay?

36:03.534 --> 36:05.133
Look around,
tell me what you see.

36:05.135 --> 36:07.068
Uh, I'm between two bridges--

36:07.070 --> 36:10.071
the-the Triborough
and Hell Gate, I think.

36:10.073 --> 36:11.072
Okay, that's Astoria Park.

36:11.074 --> 36:12.974
You're in Astoria Park;
I'm on my way.

36:12.976 --> 36:15.377
Danny, I want to give up.

36:15.379 --> 36:16.912
Just don't bring anybody else.

36:16.914 --> 36:20.448
I give you my word,
I'm coming by myself.

36:22.518 --> 36:23.785
Are you really going alone?

36:23.787 --> 36:25.854
No, this time there is something
you and Morgan can do.

36:25.856 --> 36:27.522
Come on.

36:29.058 --> 36:30.792
FRANK:
Who goes?

36:30.794 --> 36:32.494
GARRETT:
Heads up.

36:32.496 --> 36:34.629
Sid left early.

36:34.631 --> 36:36.731
Well, seeing as he's been
sleeping here,

36:36.733 --> 36:38.533
that's probably good news.

36:38.535 --> 36:39.834
Except it isn't.

36:39.836 --> 36:42.136
He left word that he's swinging
by the retirement racket

36:42.138 --> 36:43.805
for a lieutenant in the 3-1

36:43.807 --> 36:45.840
and would be on his cell phone
if he's needed.

36:45.842 --> 36:48.343
When was Sid at the 3-1?

36:48.345 --> 36:49.410
He wasn't.

36:49.412 --> 36:52.313
But Delgado was.

36:52.315 --> 36:54.315
(under his breath):
God.

36:56.018 --> 36:58.886
Don't look at me like that.

36:58.888 --> 37:00.088
Like what?

37:01.356 --> 37:03.024
What the hell am I
supposed to do?

37:03.026 --> 37:05.359
I just thought
you'd want to know.

37:05.361 --> 37:09.230
Well, next time,
give me the choice first.

37:09.232 --> 37:11.199
Will do.

37:11.201 --> 37:12.700
Is that all?

37:12.702 --> 37:13.968
You tell me.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.636
(sighs)

37:15.638 --> 37:18.839
He's a grown man, Garrett,
I can't be babysitting him.

37:18.841 --> 37:21.709
Copy that.

37:38.927 --> 37:41.295
Hello, Rose.

37:42.531 --> 37:43.964
Someone else in there?

37:43.966 --> 37:46.901
Nobody's in the car.

37:46.903 --> 37:50.204
Just like I promised.

37:50.206 --> 37:53.741
You still holding onto that gun
you took from the gas station?

37:57.445 --> 38:00.280
I'm gonna need you
to hand it over.

38:02.217 --> 38:04.952
Okay, well,
I got a gun of my own.

38:04.954 --> 38:07.154
Which I prefer not to use.

38:10.391 --> 38:12.326
Come on, Rose, I thought you
said you wanted to give up.

38:12.328 --> 38:14.695
You said a lot
of things, Danny.

38:14.697 --> 38:16.630
Those didn't turn out
to be true either.

38:16.632 --> 38:18.565
Look, you're right.

38:18.567 --> 38:20.934
I know it.

38:20.936 --> 38:23.637
And I know that it was
Trina's idea to escape.

38:23.639 --> 38:26.907
And I also know that my word
probably means nothing to you.

38:26.909 --> 38:29.509
But I'm telling you--

38:29.511 --> 38:31.178
this time, I will do
everything I can

38:31.180 --> 38:32.913
to help everyone understand
what happened to you.

38:32.915 --> 38:36.950
There's no more
telling everyone.

38:36.952 --> 38:39.319
There's no more
understanding.

38:39.321 --> 38:40.787
You had your chance,

38:40.789 --> 38:44.357
and if I go back to prison,
I'm gonna be there forever.

38:46.027 --> 38:47.694
Just take it easy.

38:47.696 --> 38:49.663
Hold on.

38:49.665 --> 38:51.264
Drop the gun, now!

38:51.266 --> 38:52.565
Hold on!
No!

38:52.567 --> 38:54.100
Drop it!
No!

38:54.102 --> 38:55.368
He sent me to hell!

38:55.370 --> 38:56.369
Rose.

38:56.371 --> 38:58.471
Rose, I failed you, okay?

38:58.473 --> 38:59.806
Don't. Stay back.

38:59.808 --> 39:01.808
I admit it.

39:01.810 --> 39:04.077
I failed you, okay?

39:04.079 --> 39:06.246
Just give me a chance
to make it right now.

39:06.248 --> 39:08.047
Please, put the gun down.

39:08.049 --> 39:09.682
No.

39:09.684 --> 39:11.017
Will you put it
down for me?

39:11.019 --> 39:12.352
What?

39:12.354 --> 39:13.553
(shrieks)

39:14.688 --> 39:16.322
(Rose sobs)

39:29.503 --> 39:31.671
Time to go.

39:47.688 --> 39:50.089
Nice work, both of youse.

39:50.091 --> 39:52.224
That's a first.

39:52.226 --> 39:54.160
Well, don't get used tit

39:56.029 --> 39:58.197
(sighs)

40:00.200 --> 40:02.134
Now, you're really
gonna help her

40:02.136 --> 40:04.103
after she just wanted
to blow your head off?

40:04.105 --> 40:06.572
I'm a softy,
what can I say?

40:06.574 --> 40:08.941
Well, thank God
you brought me along.

40:08.943 --> 40:11.444
Well, I'd be an idiot not to.

40:29.996 --> 40:31.697
MAN:
Ten-hut!

40:31.699 --> 40:33.365
FRANK:
No, please.

40:33.367 --> 40:35.701
Please, thank you.

40:35.703 --> 40:38.270
How you doing?

40:44.043 --> 40:45.611
Congratulations, Jack.

40:45.613 --> 40:46.678
Excellent.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.046
Thank you for coming.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.281
Good job.

40:49.283 --> 40:50.382
Thank <i> you,</i> sir.

40:50.384 --> 40:52.351
No, you earned it.

40:52.353 --> 40:53.652
Excuse me
for just a minute.

40:53.654 --> 40:55.220
Yes, sir.
I'll see you in a minute.

40:56.322 --> 40:57.889
Evening, sir.
Hello.

41:04.564 --> 41:08.600
You really gonna swing
at an NYPD sergeant?

41:08.602 --> 41:10.235
Just wanted to talk.

41:10.237 --> 41:13.104
Famous last words before
a lot of bad decisions.

41:13.106 --> 41:14.739
GARRETT:
Especially this one.

41:14.741 --> 41:17.242
Since you'll be taking a
swing at the wrong guy.

41:17.244 --> 41:19.511
What?

41:19.513 --> 41:21.680
It's not Delgado.

41:24.584 --> 41:26.284
But he texted the same...

41:26.286 --> 41:27.986
It's not him.

41:32.692 --> 41:34.359
Uh, do you know who it is?

41:34.361 --> 41:36.795
I do not.

41:36.797 --> 41:38.997
And that's for you
to ask Sheila.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.902
But Trey Delgado remains

41:43.904 --> 41:46.871
the cop you mentored
and the man you respect.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.711
Huh.

41:53.713 --> 41:56.714
I was in your shoes
a few years back,

41:56.716 --> 41:58.449
and a man we work
with helped me.

41:58.451 --> 42:01.185
A lot.

42:01.187 --> 42:04.188
I'm still married,
thanks in part to him.

42:04.190 --> 42:06.190
Who?

42:06.192 --> 42:08.359
Him.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.829
Really?

42:11.831 --> 42:13.531
Really.

42:13.533 --> 42:16.033
He's a lot smarter
than he lets on.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.904
Let's go get some dinner.

42:19.906 --> 42:24.342
And then, maybe,
if you feel up to it,

42:24.344 --> 42:26.477
we'll drop you home.

42:28.513 --> 42:31.215
All right.

42:31.217 --> 42:33.250
Come on.
