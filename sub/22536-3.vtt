00:01.930 --> 00:03.488
Previously on
crisis: _
The doors and wmdows

00:03.500 --> 00:05.320
Have been sealed and alarmed,
and the rooms are monitored,

00:05.330 --> 00:06.797
And your phones have been taken.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.199
(grunting)

00:08.200 --> 00:09.861
(screams)

00:09.870 --> 00:11.508
Agent finley here
is the only person

00:11.510 --> 00:13.364
Who has seen the faces
of the kidnappers.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.007
So he's with you.

00:15.010 --> 00:16.204
Sir, with me as fbi,
as secret service?

00:16.210 --> 00:18.849
With you as our only lead

00:18.850 --> 00:20.477
On the day when
the US. President's son

00:20.480 --> 00:22.641
Has been kidnapped with you.

00:22.650 --> 00:23.969
You figure out why
your partner shot you?

00:23.990 --> 00:26.208
Between us, I think
someone made him do it,

00:26.220 --> 00:27.448
But it's just a hunch.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.984
Hello?

00:28.990 --> 00:30.514
Francis:
Mr. Ambassador,

00:30.530 --> 00:31.952
What would you do
for your child?

00:31.960 --> 00:34.724
A cia black site inside
the dc pakistani embassy?

00:34.730 --> 00:37.221
Why would the cia
hold american soldiers there?

00:37.230 --> 00:38.527
Why does the
kidnapper want them?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.859
(overlapping news reports)

00:50.210 --> 00:52.678
The soldiers you found
in the pakistani embassy

00:52.680 --> 00:54.204
Are both _I.D.'d
as american,

00:54.220 --> 00:56.871
Reported missing in
action 18 months ago.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.380
(bell dings)

00:58.390 --> 01:00.210
What do the pakistanis say?

01:00.220 --> 01:02.051
The state department
is on that.

01:02.060 --> 01:03.550
We need to figure out why

01:03.560 --> 01:04.982
The kidnapper wanted
those soldiers.

01:04.990 --> 01:07.083
The kidnapper's got
an atypical profile.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.398
No public demands, no
political statements.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.561
He's got a unique agenda.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.993
We think he took those kids
to use their parents.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.264
Morgan roth, dunn's sister,
the ambassador,

01:16.270 --> 01:17.760
All used by the kidnapper.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.533
Do as he says or their kids die.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.428
First thing in the morning,
I want all parents

01:21.440 --> 01:22.930
Of the kidnapped
at that school.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.872
I want court orders to
put all those parents

01:24.880 --> 01:26.347
Under surveillance now.

01:26.350 --> 01:28.238
Wake up a judge if you have to.
Go.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.377
Okay, agents finley and dunn,

01:30.390 --> 01:31.880
You've got some traction
on this;

01:31.890 --> 01:33.881
Killed two kidnappers
at the embassy

01:33.890 --> 01:35.448
And saved two american soldiers.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.712
What's our next move
With the parents?

01:37.730 --> 01:40.688
If the kidnapper is using
parents of the kidnapped,

01:40.700 --> 01:43.555
We need to speak to the
most powerful parents.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.219
You want to go
to the white house.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.424
We need to question
the president

01:46.440 --> 01:48.237
And the first lady.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.593
I'll set it up.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.568
Finley, maybe you don't go.
Sir?

01:52.580 --> 01:54.400
You were in charge of his kid
when he was taken.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.401
You really think the president
wants to see you today?

01:56.410 --> 01:59.208
IfI had a kid, I'd want to talk
to the man who lost him.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.608
Okay.

02:14.930 --> 02:17.797
Which satellites
are currently searching for us?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.290
Almost every keyhole kh-12

02:19.300 --> 02:20.722
Backed up by the full suite

02:20.740 --> 02:22.298
Of_lacrosse-class_
radar-Imaging satellites.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.837
Show me what we look like
from 200 miles up.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.301
Law enforcement?
Monitoring all channels,

02:31.310 --> 02:32.675
And we are all they talk about.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.307
I'm feeling extremely popular.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.617
You talking back to them?

02:35.620 --> 02:37.076
Told them this grid's
been searched,

02:37.090 --> 02:38.114
And it's all clear.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.439
Power usage?

02:39.460 --> 02:40.586
Reads as zero-zero.

02:40.590 --> 02:42.410
The bypass is still
in place and good.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.452
Okay.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.325
Open up a secure line.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.150
Let's make the next call.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.725
Have you ever
been here before?

03:18.730 --> 03:20.482
Just the outer perimeter,
never inside.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.797
What about you?

03:21.800 --> 03:24.155
No.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.161
The president is in
the private quarters.

03:26.170 --> 03:27.762
He will see you now.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.488
(phone rings)

03:48.160 --> 03:49.388
Yes?

03:49.390 --> 03:51.221
Francis (distorted):
Frank becloNith?

03:51.230 --> 03:52.583
Who is this?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.249
Please confirm that this
is frank beckwith,

03:54.260 --> 03:55.852
White house chief of staff.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.397
_ This is_ _
a national security line.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.890
How did you get through to me?

03:59.900 --> 04:02.266
Never mind how I got through,
mr. Beckwith.

04:02.270 --> 04:04.329
Concentrate on the fact
that I'm here.

04:04.340 --> 04:06.205
Concentrate on the fact
that I have your son

04:06.210 --> 04:08.178
In the other room,
and he's sure at this point

04:08.180 --> 04:10.068
That no one can help him.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.503
You can help him,
if you want to.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.944
Who is this?

04:16.680 --> 04:19.046
You're a capable man,
mr. Beckwith.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.087
You came to work on the day
your son was kidnapped.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.614
You take care of this,

04:23.630 --> 04:25.518
And I will take good care
of your child.

04:25.530 --> 04:26.679
(sighs)

04:28.930 --> 04:30.591
I promise.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.760
What do you want?

04:33.770 --> 04:35.362
You're the president's
chief of staff.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.736
You speak for the most powerful
man on this planet.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.731
If you want your son to live,

04:39.740 --> 04:42.208
You will now speak for me.

04:42.210 --> 04:43.575
Call your friend,
general osborne.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.445
Tell him you need
to meet with him alone.

04:45.450 --> 04:48.647
Tell him that you have important
white house business to discuss.

04:48.650 --> 04:51.039
And the nature of this business?

04:51.050 --> 04:52.483
Truth.

04:52.490 --> 04:54.549
Truth and pain.

05:05.470 --> 05:07.768
I've always wanted to stand
next to that man.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.432
I didn't think
it would be like this.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.328
Mr. President.
Dunn: Mr. President.

05:14.110 --> 05:16.772
Mrs. Devore.
Mrs. Devore.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.008
You were with my son.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.671
Yes, ma'am.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.079
When lqle was taken,

05:21.080 --> 05:22.843
_There were six men
wrth automatic weapons.

05:22.850 --> 05:23.942
Yes, ma'am.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.986
You were shot by agent hurst?

05:27.020 --> 05:28.988
Yes, ma'am.

05:31.090 --> 05:33.081
And you managed to...

05:33.100 --> 05:34.283
Save that boy.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.427
I couldn't get to lqle.

05:36.430 --> 05:37.692
He was taken by then.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.827
I couldn't get to lqle.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.432
I'm sorry.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.635
Agent finley,

05:44.640 --> 05:46.267
You were outmanned
and outgunned.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.009
You were shot 36 hours ago,

05:48.010 --> 05:49.671
And you're standing here
still working for me,

05:49.680 --> 05:53.047
So... Let's leave the apologies
out of this office.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.511
What do you need from us?

06:00.220 --> 06:01.687
Sir, I'm sure
you've received

06:01.690 --> 06:03.783
The national security
briefing, so you know

06:03.790 --> 06:06.281
The parents are being
used by the kidnappers.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.154
You two are the most
powerful parents.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.219
We can only assume they
will try to use you.

06:11.730 --> 06:14.995
If they haven't
begun to already, sir.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.298
Agent dunn, right?

06:17.310 --> 06:18.561
Yes, sir.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.333
Meg fitch's sister?

06:20.340 --> 06:22.672
Yes, sir.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.307
You've got no problem accusing
the president

06:24.310 --> 06:26.301
Of the United States of
cooperating with the kidnappers?

06:28.220 --> 06:30.541
Not if it helps me get
the president's son back,

06:30.550 --> 06:31.915
No, sir; no, I don't.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.385
I work for those
kidnapped kids.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.289
Then there's something
both of you should know.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.919
I took an oath
to defend this country.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.739
If the kidnappers ask me
to betray that oath

06:48.740 --> 06:51.334
To save my son's life,
I won't do it.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.262
I can't.

06:54.780 --> 06:57.499
I will have to let my son die.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.941
You work
for those kidnapped kids.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.417
You find them

07:04.420 --> 07:06.217
Before I have to make
that choice.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.359
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.453
I will find your son.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.928
And hurt whoever took him.

07:19.930 --> 07:21.636
It's time to bring out
the chief of staff.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.039
Is your man in position?

07:23.040 --> 07:25.201
Just another man with a candle.

07:33.650 --> 07:36.744
Two days, three days tops.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.149
Our friends
from across the aisle are gonna

07:38.150 --> 07:40.084
Start calling
for this president to step down.

07:40.090 --> 07:41.614
They're gonna say
he's been compromised.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.282
You need to find his son
before that happens.

07:44.290 --> 07:45.552
And what about your son?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.256
My wife is at home,
crying for him.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.319
I have_ to serve
my preSIdent now.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.629
I fought with him
the last time I saw him.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.829
His room was a mess.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.400
What kind of people
take children?

08:06.420 --> 08:08.570
The kind of people
who want to use their parents.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.945
Help us get your son back.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.839
Tell us, has the kidnapper
contacted you, mr. Beckwith?

08:12.860 --> 08:15.010
No. No contact.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.658
I've been here
since the kidnapping

08:16.660 --> 08:19.254
Inside the security bubble,
so no outside contact.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.989
You haven't found a cell phone?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.149
Even ifI had,
you can't transmit

08:22.160 --> 08:23.593
A signal into this building.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.794
If they wanted to get
to the president,

08:24.800 --> 08:25.994
How would they do it?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.126
That's impossible.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.266
(phone ringing)

08:31.170 --> 08:32.762
This might be a classified call.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.431
If it is, we'll step out.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.431
Beckwith.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.769
Have you done as I asked?

08:37.780 --> 08:39.805
Yes.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.139
It's time for you to leave.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.311
I'm with the fbi now.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.015
I need to finish this up first.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.487
They're in your office?

08:46.490 --> 08:47.718
Yes.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.688
Tell them your wife's
on the phone.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.214
That you need a moment.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.993
It's my wife.
I need a moment.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.888
Get rid of them;
it's time to go.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.026
Let me talk to
your wrfe, please.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.497
I'll let her know fbi agents

08:59.500 --> 09:01.297
Are on their way
to interview her.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.865
I can tell her that.

09:03.870 --> 09:05.201
Why don't you let me?

09:10.710 --> 09:12.143
Mrs. Beckwith?

09:12.150 --> 09:13.378
Yes?

09:13.380 --> 09:16.543
This is agent dunn;
fbi agents

09:16.550 --> 09:17.676
Are on their way
to speak with you.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.180
Can you confirm

09:19.190 --> 09:20.384
Your address for me?

09:20.390 --> 09:22.187
7582 park avenue,

09:22.190 --> 09:23.851
Alexandria,

09:23.860 --> 09:26.158
But there's no need
to send them there.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.422
Why not?

09:27.430 --> 09:29.318
I am at the front fence,
at the vigil.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.059
I was hoping

09:31.070 --> 09:33.561
My husband could join me
to light a candle for our son.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.194
Would that be okay?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.737
Of course.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.339
See your wife yet?

09:51.350 --> 09:52.578
No, not yet.

09:53.790 --> 09:56.088
(crowd screaming)

09:59.690 --> 10:02.693
(woman whimpering)

10:08.300 --> 10:10.188
(screaming)

10:15.540 --> 10:17.599
(screaming continues)

10:22.920 --> 10:24.273
Can you see him?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.417
No!

10:26.420 --> 10:28.411
Out of the way!
Fbi! Out of the way!

10:28.420 --> 10:29.956
Move, move!

10:32.260 --> 10:33.557
What's he holding?

10:33.560 --> 10:34.652
Some kind of bag.

10:34.660 --> 10:35.991
He didn't have it

10:36.000 --> 10:37.297
When he came
out of the white house.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.858
No, he picked it up out here.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.567
(men shouting)

10:45.570 --> 10:47.504
This is special agent dunn.
This is secret service agent

10:47.510 --> 10:49.239
Marcus finley, in pursuit
of the suspect on foot

10:49.240 --> 10:50.935
Heading north on 17th street.
Frank becloNith,

10:50.950 --> 10:52.474
White house chief of staff.
Request backup.
Suspect is

10:52.480 --> 10:54.141
Frank becloNith,
white house chief of staff.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.209
(indistinct conversations)

11:00.590 --> 11:03.150
Excuse me, sir.
We need to go to the bunker.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.526
There's a disturbance
at the fence.
Where's my wife?

11:05.530 --> 11:07.589
We are moving her.
Where's frank beckwith?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.999
Where's my chief of staff?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.752
Fbi and secret service
are In purswt of hIm.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.123
Gentlemen, we need to move.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.826
I want birds in the air _
and all cameras up and running.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.092
Frank becloNith
is tapped into this city.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.101
If the kidnapper
uses him as a weapon,

11:19.110 --> 11:20.839
He can do real damage.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.377
No taxi picks up a fare
until I say so.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.200
I want the metro shut down

11:25.210 --> 11:27.144
In a ten-block grid,
no trains moving.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.710
I want all traffic lights red.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.347
(car horns honking)

11:31.350 --> 11:33.341
(tires screeching)

11:33.360 --> 11:35.419
(train brakes screeching)

11:38.390 --> 11:39.982
If it comes to it,
do we shoot him?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.252
If he puts lives at risk,
do we have a choice?

11:44.900 --> 11:46.822
(horn blares)

11:46.840 --> 11:49.297
(tires screech, horn honks)

11:51.970 --> 11:53.107
Get on.

11:56.210 --> 11:57.438
Fbi!

12:06.490 --> 12:08.139
I'm not shooting a parent.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.458
Not yet.

12:13.990 --> 12:15.594
(static crackles)

12:15.600 --> 12:16.897
Francis (distorted):
You were wondering

12:16.900 --> 12:18.720
What happened
to your friend aziz.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.698
He's home with his parents.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.361
They did as we asked.

12:22.370 --> 12:24.565
And aziz was returned to them.

12:24.570 --> 12:27.403
Some of your parents will be
asked to do something for us.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.174
Something to secure
your freedom.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.841
If they do as we ask,

12:31.850 --> 12:34.944
You will go home, too.

12:34.950 --> 12:38.408
And if our parents
don't do what they ask?

12:42.960 --> 12:44.257
Find that motorcycle?

12:44.260 --> 12:45.921
We found surveillance footage,

12:45.930 --> 12:49.627
But haven't pinpointed
their location yet.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.135
Let's go!

13:03.310 --> 13:04.436
I know you, don't I?

13:04.450 --> 13:05.747
Clark froy.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.047
I'm a dad in the class.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.938
I found a phone in my house.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.748
A voice told me to get you
or my child dies.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.149
We have to keep moving.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.310
(phone ringing)

13:17.090 --> 13:18.728
You have met mr. Froy?

13:18.730 --> 13:19.981
Yes.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.228
What's in the bag?

13:21.230 --> 13:22.492
It's locked, mr. Beckwith.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.592
Need-to-know.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.953
Isn't that the term you use?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.289
This is insane!

13:26.300 --> 13:27.426
What if I can't do
what you want?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.634
My son will die?!

13:28.640 --> 13:29.766
Why would you want
that to happen?!

13:29.770 --> 13:30.794
I'm hanging up.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.266
Dump the phone, take the bag

13:32.270 --> 13:33.305
And get in the car.

13:33.310 --> 13:34.504
Don't go, please!

13:34.510 --> 13:35.807
I can't do this.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.175
Then you are weak

13:37.180 --> 13:38.909
Just as you always feared
about yourself.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.639
You're surrounded by power.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.777
But soon the only thing
you'll have left of your son

13:42.780 --> 13:44.839
Is his messy room.

13:51.860 --> 13:53.919
(engine starts)

13:58.770 --> 14:00.294
Man:
Man, you must really hate them.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.699
Hate who?

14:01.700 --> 14:03.691
Parents at that school
your kid goes to.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.803
They're just the tool.
You don't hate the tool.

14:05.810 --> 14:07.437
The tool?

14:07.440 --> 14:08.930
(puts bowl down)

14:08.940 --> 14:11.670
About a year ago,
I was at a charity auction

14:11.680 --> 14:13.545
For that school my kid goes to.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.313
I saw parents bid

14:15.320 --> 14:18.619
30 grand for artwork
their kids did.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.508
I couldn't afford
my mortgage anymore.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.385
And I saw one guy
spend 100 grand

14:22.390 --> 14:25.018
On a weekend
at another guy's vacation home.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.783
You know what else I saw?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.893
No.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.027
I saw a mission.

14:32.030 --> 14:35.158
I spent the last
20 years of my life

14:35.170 --> 14:36.865
In the basement of the cia

14:36.870 --> 14:39.566
Planning coups,
assassinations, insurrections.

14:39.570 --> 14:43.074
But that night,
I saw the perfect mission.

14:44.310 --> 14:45.379
All you'd have to do

14:45.380 --> 14:46.677
Is to take the children

14:46.680 --> 14:48.204
Of those people
who control the world.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.745
Make the parents your weapons.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.547
Then you can have
anything you want.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.108
What do you want?

14:55.560 --> 14:57.653
I want to break _
those people at the Cla

14:57.660 --> 15:01.551
The way they broke me.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.830
And to save these children.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.159
They've been kidnapped.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.808
They need to be rescued.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.930
Egg-in-a-hole.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.942
Used to make this
for my daughter.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.418
On her birthday.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.183
Go make your rounds.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.084
We were standing right here.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.624
And the kidnapper was
on the phone with him.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.154
On the phone with me.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.192
White house operator.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.691
Yes, this is secret service
agent marcus finley.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.259
Please use _v_oice match
for verification.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.134
Verified.
I need to be connected

15:49.140 --> 15:51.028
To the last _call
that came Into this phone.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.699
One moment, agent finley.

15:54.150 --> 15:55.617
They're back
in beckwith's office

15:55.620 --> 15:57.417
Dialing that last number.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.888
Route it right on
through, please.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.948
Woman:
Hello? Frank?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.052
Mrs. Beckwith?

16:07.060 --> 16:08.482
Who is this?

16:08.500 --> 16:10.320
Why are you calling me
on my husband's phone?

16:10.330 --> 16:11.797
This is the secret service.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.166
Have you placed a call
to your husband today?

16:14.170 --> 16:15.432
No, I-I haven't.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.429
What is this about?

16:16.440 --> 16:17.896
Are there fbi agents there?

16:17.910 --> 16:20.504
Yes.
May I speak with them?

16:20.510 --> 16:23.070
Someone from the secret service
IS on the line for you.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.399
This is daniels.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.207
We're on_scene.
The house IS secure.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.640
The kidnapper may have been
on this line,

16:31.650 --> 16:34.016
But the call traces back
to beckwith's house now.

16:34.020 --> 16:36.079
We need to talk to
the president.
He's in the bunker.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.081
His chief of staff is
on a mission for the kidnappers,

16:38.090 --> 16:39.580
So we need to speak
to him, please.

16:39.590 --> 16:40.955
Explain it to her.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.928
If potus is down there,
he's down there.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.750
There's nothing
we can do to bring him up.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.119
Then get him this message.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.165
If he wants us to find lqle

16:50.170 --> 16:52.638
Before the kidnappers call,
then he needs to come up here

16:52.640 --> 16:55.108
And help us figure out
exactly what kind of damage

16:55.110 --> 16:58.170
His own chief of staff
is about to do.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.273
36 hours
into the mass kidnapping

17:00.280 --> 17:02.111
Of the ballard school children,
and this story

17:02.120 --> 17:04.042
Has taken a bizarre twist.

17:04.050 --> 17:05.608
Body parts found
at the front fence

17:05.620 --> 17:08.043
Of the white house
this evening...

17:08.060 --> 17:10.187
_ Man:
Breaking news now
from 1600 pennsylvania avenue.

17:10.190 --> 17:13.023
A series of small explosions
and a gruesome discovery

17:13.030 --> 17:14.383
At the vigil for the kidnapped
ballard children...
(alarm blaring)

17:14.400 --> 17:16.459
What is that?

17:16.460 --> 17:18.052
Attempted breach of a
window in bedroom three.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.221
One of the hostages
is trying to get out.

17:47.090 --> 17:50.423
He spent the last two years
in the white house.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.762
He's used to living
under surveillance.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.658
He's sticking close
to the walls.

17:54.670 --> 17:55.989
Away from the cameras.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.934
He's looking for a way out.

17:57.940 --> 17:59.237
He's looking to be a hero.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.434
Like his father.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.931
I didn't vote for him.

18:05.850 --> 18:09.342
So, what are you gonna do
about junior up there?

18:15.260 --> 18:17.558
(grunts)

18:17.560 --> 18:20.984
(grunting)

18:24.770 --> 18:27.591
Just because this is
a beautiful house,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.261
Don't make the mistake
of thinking

18:29.270 --> 18:31.192
That terrible things
cannot happen to you here.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.599
You belong to me now.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.874
You have the most
powerful parents on earth.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.279
They can't find you.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.147
If I want to take
the air from your lungs,

18:40.150 --> 18:42.869
Your weeping mother
can't stop me.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.644
You have 45 seconds

18:45.650 --> 18:47.880
Before death.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.085
Have you ever been this close?

18:50.090 --> 18:51.751
Your father ends lives
every day.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.920
I can do it, too.

18:52.930 --> 18:55.057
Your parents want you back.

18:55.060 --> 18:56.322
I know that.

18:56.330 --> 18:58.150
But at some point,

18:58.170 --> 19:01.526
They're just gonna be happy
to have your body returned.

19:04.340 --> 19:05.398
Go back to bed.

19:06.810 --> 19:09.301
(gasping for air)

19:18.020 --> 19:20.079
(indistinct chatter)

19:23.920 --> 19:25.979
The severed finger comes back
a match to the parent chaperone

19:25.990 --> 19:27.753
Francis gibson.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.694
Yeah, and now they're
sending out body parts.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.588
At least it's not from a kid.
Not yet.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.124
Where are we with beckwith?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.529
Tracked beckwith's phone
to the motorcycle.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.791
Both abandoned in the alley.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.267
Found fresh tire tracks

19:37.270 --> 19:39.101
From a high-end european sedan.

19:39.110 --> 19:41.032
White house chief of staff,
the president's right hand,

19:41.040 --> 19:42.837
Out there trying
to keep his kid alive.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.307
We've got everyone
looking for him,

19:44.310 --> 19:46.369
And we've tasked
local pd, too.

19:46.380 --> 19:48.678
All right, these are the
kidnappers you two killed.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.477
All died of gunshot wounds,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.287
But since you two did the
shooting, that's not news.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.986
No hits on dna,
fingerprints or dental.

19:54.990 --> 19:57.515
These men have been
scrubbed from the system.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.953
Finley, the guy
you killed at the cabin,

19:59.960 --> 20:01.382
You said he fought
like special forces, right?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.960
Yeah, he did.
Pull up the autopsy report.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.665
Yeah, all three of these guys
have trigger-finger calluses.

20:10.670 --> 20:13.138
The kind only
special forces operators get.

20:13.140 --> 20:15.358
Let's show their photos
in the special forces community.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.304
Someone will know them.
Let's show his photo
somewhere else first.

20:21.750 --> 20:24.139
My client is hoping
that his cooperation here

20:24.150 --> 20:25.708
Will be taken into account.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.483
Your client helped
take down a drone

20:27.490 --> 20:29.310
That would have found
those kidnapped kids.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.379
He cooperates or I turn him
over to the other parents.

20:31.390 --> 20:32.926
You don't have any kids, do you?

20:34.060 --> 20:35.698
No. I don't.

20:35.700 --> 20:39.727
Then you have no idea what
you would do to keep them safe.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.561
Mr. Roth, do you recognize
any of these men?

20:41.570 --> 20:43.390
Did you see any of them

20:43.400 --> 20:44.992
In the days leading
up to the kidnapping?

20:45.010 --> 20:46.432
Why?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.408
The kidnapper knows a great
deal about the parents.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.037
These men _could've
been followmg you.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.099
I don't recognize them,

20:52.110 --> 20:54.078
But if they were around,
anton would.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.116
He's got a photographic memory.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.519
Mr. Roth, are you okay with us

20:57.520 --> 20:59.010
Showing photos of dead men
to your son?

20:59.020 --> 21:00.385
Yes.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.358
I can tell you what he'll say.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.612
The dead human body
is basically a bag

21:04.630 --> 21:06.450
Of rapidly evaporating water.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.087
Ithink I can handle it.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.158
Let me see.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.727
Finley, you killed
all these guys?

21:14.740 --> 21:16.799
Two. She killed one.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.960
Badasses.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.437
Epic badasses.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.372
Anton, we're here

21:22.380 --> 21:24.632
To help your friends.
This is serious.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.538
I know. (sighs)

21:26.550 --> 21:29.644
I-I'm dealing with my stress by
making inappropriate comments.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.242
These two.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.911
Last Wednesday, 3:15 p.M.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.217
They came to our house.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.983
They said they were
from the dwp.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.389
You sure?

21:37.390 --> 21:38.789
They had a truck and everything.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.621
Where'd they park it?
In the driveway.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.791
Mr. Roth, you have a home
security system, am I right?

21:46.570 --> 21:49.095
We have the feed from roth's
home security camera?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.328
It's coming through now.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.399
Back it up--
Wednesday, 3:15.

21:54.070 --> 21:56.402
Finley:
There it is.

21:56.410 --> 21:58.332
pr.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.806
If these guys were
surveilling the roths

21:59.810 --> 22:01.607
To use for parent missions,

22:01.620 --> 22:03.110
What other parents
were they watching?

22:03.120 --> 22:05.270
I want you to commandeer
every camera in this city

22:05.290 --> 22:07.110
And find out where
that dwp truck came from,

22:07.120 --> 22:09.088
Where it went and where
it stopped along the way.

22:09.090 --> 22:10.352
Take a few hours.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.180
You got 20 minutes.
Then what happens?

22:12.190 --> 22:14.579
She puts someone else
in your chair.

22:19.870 --> 22:21.462
What would you do?

22:21.470 --> 22:23.529
If you had a kid
and the kidnapper asked you?

22:23.540 --> 22:25.929
Yeah, we should start
thinking like that

22:25.940 --> 22:28.636
If we want to get ahead
of the parents.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.198
So what would you do?

22:32.650 --> 22:34.504
Anything.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.216
I mean, isn't that how it goes?

22:37.220 --> 22:40.883
Would you hurt innocent people
to get your kid back?

22:42.120 --> 22:44.350
I think we should be ready

22:44.360 --> 22:46.419
For these parents
to do just that.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.049
What about you?

22:51.130 --> 22:52.563
If you had a kid.

22:54.030 --> 22:55.839
I got a bunch of nieces
and nephews.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.637
I'd do just about anything
for them,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.801
But my own kid,

22:59.810 --> 23:01.732
There'd be no stopping me.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.479
Got what you asked for.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.348
The van left the dwp depot
at 8:00 a.M.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.215
And made three stops
before it returned to the depot

23:13.220 --> 23:15.040
Later that night;
the homes of morgan roth,

23:15.060 --> 23:16.550
Frank becloNith and a clark froy.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.710
Roth and beckwith we know.
Who is dark froy?

23:20.930 --> 23:22.158
(muttering):
Clark froy.

23:24.430 --> 23:25.897
His daughter,

23:25.900 --> 23:27.492
Jessica,
is one of the kidnapped.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.990
He owns a string
of car dealerships.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.490
Motorcycles, too.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.762
We got our second parent.

23:34.170 --> 23:35.706
I know you
from around the school,

23:35.710 --> 23:37.575
But I know you
from somewhere else.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.241
You're on those billboards.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.070
Yes, clark froy.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.911
So you work with
the president?

23:42.920 --> 23:44.410
Chief of staff, yes.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.887
I bet you've seen some stuff.

23:45.890 --> 23:47.585
Yes.
Anything like this?

23:47.590 --> 23:49.581
Uh, no, nothing like this.

23:49.590 --> 23:51.512
We need to figure this out,
what they want,

23:51.530 --> 23:52.929
Why they're using us.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.579
Do you know general osborne?
No.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.192
No, I served, army,

23:56.200 --> 23:58.589
But, uh, generals were way
above my pay grade. Why?

23:58.600 --> 24:00.397
I was told to arrange a meeting.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.027
You know him?
Yeah.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.632
He's an old friend.
I mean,

24:03.640 --> 24:05.460
Maybe you're just a driver.

24:05.470 --> 24:07.028
I don't think so.
Why not?

24:07.040 --> 24:09.235
The lock on that bag
you're holding--

24:09.240 --> 24:11.731
They left the key
with the phone.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.446
They're gonna give me a call
so I know when to open it.

24:14.450 --> 24:15.644
Give me the key.

24:15.650 --> 24:17.618
No. No!
Give me the key.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.214
We do what they want,
we get our kids back.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.950
Tracking froy's phone.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.428
No signal.
Must have pulled the battery.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.284
They'll be using burner phones
supplied by the kidnapper.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.927
If you're the kidnapper,

24:29.930 --> 24:31.989
I get why you use
the president's chief of staff.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.662
Beckwith's got real power,
but why use a car dealer?

24:34.670 --> 24:37.298
_ You use a car dealer
If you don't want to be found.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.993
Froy has access to four,
maybe 500 cars.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.659
He could be using
any one of them.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.908
An inventory would take hours.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.832
We don't have hours.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.135
This is going down right now.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.401
We need to find those parents.

24:46.410 --> 24:47.809
We stay on beckwith.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.447
Like you said,
he's got the real power.

24:49.450 --> 24:51.111
We just need to figure out
what he's doing with it.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.678
We need to go
back to the white house.

24:54.190 --> 24:56.488
They knew I was coming.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.185
Did you pick up
any accent this time?

24:58.190 --> 25:00.249
Maybe american,
maybe not,

25:00.260 --> 25:01.784
But he's their leader.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.325
We were out for what,
12 hours, after the bus?

25:04.330 --> 25:06.662
If they put us on a plane,
we could be anywhere.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.262
No, we're still in america.

25:08.270 --> 25:10.135
How do you know?
Electrical outlets.

25:10.140 --> 25:11.835
They're old,
but they're still not the kind

25:11.840 --> 25:13.034
They have in other countries.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.598
I think we're still
in the states.

25:14.610 --> 25:15.804
Okay.

25:15.810 --> 25:17.175
So we can use that.

25:17.180 --> 25:18.772
"use that"?

25:18.780 --> 25:21.999
Look, I know your dad
is his dad's chief of staff,

25:22.020 --> 25:24.170
But what's the point
of the kiddie situation room?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.511
I was briefed on this.
Briefea’ on
this?

25:26.520 --> 25:28.215
If I was taken,
what I should do.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.051
That if it's safe,

25:30.060 --> 25:32.551
I need to be an active hostage,
learn what I can.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.324
Briefed by who?
Hurst.

25:35.330 --> 25:37.150
The guy in charge
back there?

25:37.160 --> 25:38.821
Did hurst brief you
on what to do

25:38.830 --> 25:40.525
When he shoots
the guy protecting you

25:40.540 --> 25:42.690
And then kidnaps us?
What do you think we should do?

25:42.700 --> 25:43.735
Stick together,

25:43.740 --> 25:46.538
Like we do
on the outside.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.201
And what happened
when you went out there?

25:48.210 --> 25:50.075
They almost killed me.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.173
They let me know
it would be easy to do.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.876
_So screw _
the "active hostage" thing.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.472
It's not safe.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.175
If we're gonna die in here,

25:58.190 --> 26:00.511
I don't want to be
the first in line, you know?

26:00.520 --> 26:02.579
No, we're not gonna die here.

26:02.590 --> 26:05.684
Right now, our dads
are in the white house,

26:05.690 --> 26:07.157
And they're gonna do
whatever they need to do

26:07.160 --> 26:08.422
To get us out of here.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.863
This is secret service agent
marcus finley.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.895
Please use _v_oice match
for verification.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.730
Man: Verified.
You tracked a call

26:19.740 --> 26:21.002
Into this line for me.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.898
Yes, sir,
I have a record of that.

26:22.910 --> 26:24.275
Did any other calls

26:24.280 --> 26:25.599
Come in to this line
from that number?

26:25.610 --> 26:27.407
About an hour earlier,
a call came in

26:27.420 --> 26:29.103
To mr. BecloNith's line
from that number.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.771
Thank you.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.179
Beckwith got two calls
from the kidnapper.

26:34.190 --> 26:37.079
One while we were here and the
other about an hour earlier.

26:37.090 --> 26:39.854
He gets a call, waits an hour,
gets another call, then leaves.

26:39.860 --> 26:41.680
Beckwith's in the white house
for an hour

26:41.700 --> 26:43.895
Between those two calls, finley.
What's he do for the kidnapper?

26:43.900 --> 26:47.222
We need to see the surveillance
tape of this office.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.458
There is no
surveillance tape

26:48.470 --> 26:49.698
Of this office,
agent finley.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.962
We all know that every inch

26:50.970 --> 26:52.631
Of this building
is under surveillance.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.063
We all know that this is
mr. Beckwith's private office.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.878
It would be illegal for us
to surveil it or him

26:57.880 --> 26:59.131
Without his knowledge,
agent finley.

26:59.150 --> 27:01.778
I think we should let them
see the tape.

27:01.780 --> 27:04.146
My chief of staff is being
forced to help the kidnappers.

27:04.150 --> 27:05.777
It appears so, yes, sir.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.644
Then let's go see what

27:07.660 --> 27:09.218
Those sons of bitches
made frank do.

27:14.930 --> 27:17.296
It's on this _
monitor here, Sir.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.325
It shows mr. BecloNith
in his office between the first

27:19.330 --> 27:20.558
And second calls.

27:21.970 --> 27:24.495
You want to high-speed
through it?

27:25.840 --> 27:27.762
Dunn:
We're gonna need

27:27.780 --> 27:29.168
The names of all these people.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.932
There.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.429
Stop it there.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.008
That's a picture of his son

27:34.020 --> 27:35.271
He's holding.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.145
Play it in real time.

27:39.850 --> 27:42.239
Finley:
Look at him.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.251
Beckwith's doing something there
that he doesn't want to do.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.250
Mark,

27:47.260 --> 27:49.649
The president is getting a,
uh, working group together

27:49.660 --> 27:53.164
To discuss an off-the-books
military reaction

27:53.170 --> 27:55.991
To the kidnapping.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.695
No, don't come
to the white house.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.133
I will let you know
where to meet.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.870
Sir, do you have any idea
who mark would be?

28:02.880 --> 28:04.973
I'm guessing
general mark osborne.

28:04.980 --> 28:07.301
And did you ask beckwith
to set that meeting up?

28:07.310 --> 28:08.868
No.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.279
He didn't do that for me.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.143
Then he did it
for the kidnapper.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.355
You were special forces.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.009
You were trained
to re5ist torture, right?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.783
Resist, but it always ends
the same way with torture.

28:20.800 --> 28:21.983
What way is that?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.558
Everyone breaks.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.990
Du_nn:
Sir,

28:32.010 --> 28:33.807
General mark osborne
in charge

28:33.810 --> 28:35.129
Of an advanced _
weapons systems unit.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.199
Location unknown
as of an hour ago.

28:37.210 --> 28:38.871
The general a dad at ballard?

28:38.880 --> 28:40.848
No, we think he's the target.
Let's find the general

28:40.850 --> 28:44.217
Before the kidnapper gets a hold
of any advanced weapons systems.

28:44.220 --> 28:45.642
We're tracking his phone.

28:45.650 --> 28:47.015
It's a military-secure
blackberry.

28:47.020 --> 28:48.180
You'll need a court order.

28:48.190 --> 28:50.658
Picked one up
at the white house.

28:50.660 --> 28:53.185
Fbi is tracking osborne's phone.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.919
You gave froy and beckwith
burner phones,

28:54.930 --> 28:56.989
But not the general;
he's still got his own phone?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.150
Those feds got ahead of me.

28:59.170 --> 29:02.059
I didn't expect that they'd
figure the general was my target

29:02.070 --> 29:04.834
Until it was over.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.001
Those feds don't stop.

29:07.010 --> 29:10.229
Clone the general's
number, please.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.229
Ten more seconds, sir.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.605
(beeping)

29:14.920 --> 29:16.740
Copy the clone,
project the copies.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.881
That's it.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.255
That's the general's phone.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.319
(rapid beeping)

29:27.690 --> 29:28.884
He's projecting
cloned copies.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.197
The kidnapper is messing

29:30.200 --> 29:31.929
With us right now in real time.

29:31.930 --> 29:33.363
They're all diversions,

29:33.370 --> 29:35.725
But we need to check
all these locations now.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.935
We'll take that one.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.965
It's the kingsley grand.

29:39.970 --> 29:41.631
Tha_t hotel has
a preSIdential swte.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.971
It's a secure location

29:42.980 --> 29:44.800
The white house chief of staff
has access to.

29:48.780 --> 29:51.715
What if we stop the parents
from doing as they're told,

29:51.720 --> 29:53.483
And the kidnapper kills a kid?
VVhatthen?

29:53.490 --> 29:54.980
I guess that depends on what

29:54.990 --> 29:56.457
We're stopping the parents
from doing.

30:01.490 --> 30:04.129
Where's mr. BecloNith?
He's meeting the
general at the hotel.

30:07.630 --> 30:10.633
Where's mr. Froy?
He took the bag up
to the hotel suite.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.631
We don't have a
video feed in there,

30:12.640 --> 30:15.006
But he should be
waiting for your call.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.023
(phone rings)

30:33.030 --> 30:34.782
Francis (distorted):
Mr. Beckwith give you the bag?

30:34.800 --> 30:36.654
Yes.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.594
(sighs)
what do you want with me?

30:38.600 --> 30:40.158
Five years ago,
you were shot down

30:40.170 --> 30:42.092
And tortured for three weeks

30:42.100 --> 30:43.590
Before you were rescued.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.033
That was horrible.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.701
Why are you telling me this now?

30:46.710 --> 30:47.961
Use the key.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.163
Open the bag now.

30:54.010 --> 30:55.500
(lock clattering)

31:02.160 --> 31:04.515
Mr. Froy?

31:05.860 --> 31:08.328
Do to the general
what was done to you.

31:08.330 --> 31:10.491
Make something of that horror.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.559
Please...

31:14.170 --> 31:16.161
I-I'll do anything else.

31:16.170 --> 31:18.331
I don't need you
to do anything else.

31:18.340 --> 31:19.864
I need you to do this.

31:19.870 --> 31:21.929
(door opens)

31:31.680 --> 31:32.840
Who the hell are you?

31:32.850 --> 31:34.715
What the hell's
going on here?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.195
Five blocks.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.827
We run for it.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.678
I get what you want
with osborne.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.773
What I don't get
is the five-star hotel.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.248
The presidential suite
would arouse no suspicion

32:06.250 --> 32:09.117
In the general,
and it's soundproof.

32:12.090 --> 32:15.025
This is insane!

32:15.030 --> 32:17.590
That man is a friend of mine!
We went to school together!

32:17.600 --> 32:18.851
Froy:
Don't think about it.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.690
Put your mind somewhere else.
It'll help.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.431
Put the earbud in the general.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.200
(grunting)

32:30.210 --> 32:31.336
(panting):
Sorry. Sorry.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.711
Can you see that light?

32:39.890 --> 32:41.414
Yes.
When it's green,

32:41.420 --> 32:44.253
Use the cables on him.
When it's red, stop.

32:44.260 --> 32:47.127
You and mr. Beckwith put those
headphones on now.

32:47.130 --> 32:49.325
Then remove the tape.

32:49.330 --> 32:51.059
That way, you can't hear
what the general's saying.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.789
You don't need
to know any of that.

32:58.940 --> 33:00.305
Can you hear me, general?

33:01.770 --> 33:03.909
I'm going to ask you
a few questions

33:03.910 --> 33:05.138
About operation lenox.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.344
Who the hell is this?

33:06.350 --> 33:07.977
See that man in front of you?

33:07.980 --> 33:10.016
He wants his daughter back.

33:10.020 --> 33:12.671
How far do you think
he'll go to do that?

33:12.690 --> 33:14.908
Operation lenox, there was
a massacre. People died.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.751
I need proof of that.

33:16.760 --> 33:17.818
Where can I find it?

33:17.830 --> 33:19.479
I don't know

33:19.490 --> 33:20.923
What you're talking about.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.771
No...

33:40.510 --> 33:42.068
(gasping)

33:54.490 --> 33:56.720
I need you to make a call.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.197
I've been here before.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.191
The top floor is
the presidential suite.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.225
Like a bunker.
Let's check in at security.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.992
I am in the lobby right now.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.059
There is a black man with a gun.

34:06.070 --> 34:07.799
Oh, god.

34:07.810 --> 34:10.005
I don't know what to do.

34:10.010 --> 34:12.877
We need help in the lobby.

34:18.180 --> 34:20.910
(pained screaming)

34:20.920 --> 34:21.989
(sizzling)

34:21.990 --> 34:23.719
(groans)

34:26.160 --> 34:27.582
When that light goes green,

34:27.590 --> 34:30.354
He will begin again
and he will not stop.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.851
He loves his daughter more
than he hates this.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.861
And he knows now
how to get her back.

34:34.870 --> 34:37.191
He just has to keep hurting you.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.667
Again: Operation lenox.

34:38.670 --> 34:40.160
Where do I find proof?

34:40.170 --> 34:42.263
I don't know that name.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.236
Those were your men.
You chose them.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.878
There was a massacre.
People died.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.279
Where can I find proof?

34:47.280 --> 34:50.169
How do you know that?

34:50.180 --> 34:51.875
Gibson.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.448
You're francis gibson.

34:53.450 --> 34:55.213
No.

34:55.220 --> 34:57.609
But when we broke gibson,
he gave you up.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.110
Where is the proof?

34:59.130 --> 35:01.257
There is no proof.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.251
What you want does not exist.

35:08.530 --> 35:10.737
This gets my kid back.
This gets my kid back.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.037
This gets my kid back.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.860
(groans)

35:17.980 --> 35:19.800
(screams)

35:19.810 --> 35:21.869
I'm secret service.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.518
Fbi. I'm gonna go
for my badge.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.980
Sorry. We got a call.

35:28.990 --> 35:30.116
What did that call say?

35:30.120 --> 35:31.417
Man with a gun in the lobby.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.613
The kidnapper knows we're here.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.654
Then we're in the right place.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.059
I'm gonna call for backup.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.790
I need the secure key
for that suite.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.620
(screams)

35:39.630 --> 35:41.359
(gasping)

35:45.440 --> 35:46.907
To make sure
he keeps doing this.

35:46.910 --> 35:48.502
I know you want your son, but...

35:48.510 --> 35:51.070
You can stop this. Stop him.

35:52.110 --> 35:53.646
Look at the light, general.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.641
(groans)

36:03.520 --> 36:05.511
No. No!

36:05.530 --> 36:08.249
No,no,no!
The proof of the massacre

36:08.260 --> 36:10.990
By those soldiers
is on a helmet cam video.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.353
Where is that video?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.092
Vault 48...

36:15.100 --> 36:16.636
Cia, main building.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.596
Authenticate it.
State your name.

36:18.610 --> 36:22.137
Mark osborne.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.779
General, US. Army.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.511
(sighs) oh, god!

36:32.520 --> 36:34.579
(gasping)

36:37.660 --> 36:38.854
Sorry, mark.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.122
I had no choice.

36:40.130 --> 36:41.483
They were gonna
kill my kid.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.728
It's okay, frank.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.357
It's okay. I understand.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.295
But he's gonna kill me,
you know that, right?

36:47.300 --> 36:49.564
He's gonna make you kill me.

36:50.970 --> 36:52.767
You gotta untie me.

37:04.350 --> 37:06.147
What did you do?

37:06.150 --> 37:08.289
My turn to ask
the questions.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.479
What do you know
about the kidnapper?

37:11.490 --> 37:12.809
Nothing!

37:14.190 --> 37:15.555
Mark, what the hell
are you doing?!

37:15.560 --> 37:17.858
I'm shooting him
until he dies,

37:17.860 --> 37:19.396
And then I'm gonna start
on you, frank.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.719
What do you know
about the kidnapper?

37:20.730 --> 37:22.368
I don't know anything.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.997
(groaning)

37:24.000 --> 37:25.865
Federal agents!

37:25.870 --> 37:28.430
Federal agents!

37:29.410 --> 37:30.570
General mark osborne?

37:30.580 --> 37:32.207
Yes.

37:32.210 --> 37:34.007
We're here to help you.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.414
That man needs
medical attention.

37:43.420 --> 37:44.853
You need to put
the gun down.

37:44.860 --> 37:47.556
They were gonna kill me.
I had to shoot him.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.221
That's not what happened.
That's not why you shot him!

37:49.230 --> 37:50.527
They were gonna kill me.

37:50.530 --> 37:51.758
We can figure
all that out later,

37:51.770 --> 37:54.364
But right now, put the gun down.

37:54.370 --> 37:57.737
Francis (distorted):
General, they're here
to help you.

37:57.740 --> 37:58.968
Put the gun down.

37:58.970 --> 38:01.109
Go on.
Finley:
General...

38:01.110 --> 38:03.271
You've been through a lot, and
you're not thinking straight.

38:04.580 --> 38:06.229
Just put the gun down
so we can help.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.899
Let them help you.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.775
Let them take you out of here.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.544
To the court-martial
that waits for you.

38:12.550 --> 38:15.087
To your family
turning away from you.

38:15.090 --> 38:18.912
Your children think
you're a patriot.

38:18.930 --> 38:22.320
But you're not.
You're a criminal, a murderer.

38:22.330 --> 38:26.255
Let those agents help you out
of here so you can face that.

38:26.270 --> 38:28.158
Finley:
Put the gun down!

38:28.170 --> 38:30.468
That man is gonna die
if we don't get him help.

38:30.470 --> 38:32.438
Let us help you here.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.101
It's_all out there
waiting for you.

38:34.110 --> 38:37.170
Shame, humiliation,

38:37.180 --> 38:38.602
The truth.

38:38.610 --> 38:41.147
And something else.
Do you know what?

38:41.150 --> 38:42.742
What?

38:42.750 --> 38:44.172
What else?

38:44.180 --> 38:45.340
Who are you talking to?

38:45.350 --> 38:46.749
Who's he talking
to, finley?

38:46.750 --> 38:48.286
What else waits for me?

38:48.290 --> 38:49.917
Put the gun down now!

38:49.920 --> 38:51.911
A cia bullet.

38:51.930 --> 38:55.422
There's no way they're
ever letting you testify.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.449
Oh, god, he's right.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.528
He's talking to the kidnapper.

38:59.530 --> 39:01.259
No! No!

39:01.270 --> 39:02.828
(gunshot)

39:05.200 --> 39:07.703
Wipe all trace of this call.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.375
What did general osborne
tell the kidnappers?

39:11.380 --> 39:12.506
I don't know.

39:12.510 --> 39:14.341
What questions did they ask him?

39:14.350 --> 39:15.772
I don't know.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.544
You were in the room
the entire time

39:18.550 --> 39:20.711
Your friend was being tortured.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.381
I couldn't hear anything.

39:22.390 --> 39:24.984
Not a word.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.787
We just wanted our kids back.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.849
I asked what
we were gonna do.

39:30.630 --> 39:35.067
And that voice said,
"truth and pain."

39:36.340 --> 39:38.069
Isn't that what happened?

39:39.370 --> 39:41.804
Don't I get my kid back now?

39:49.820 --> 39:52.812
Where are we?

39:52.820 --> 39:56.950
We... We were at the
mansion, and then...

40:15.370 --> 40:18.407
Dad! Dad!

40:30.390 --> 40:31.550
The kidnapper used
those parents

40:31.560 --> 40:33.209
To torture general osborne,

40:33.230 --> 40:35.881
And the general gave up
something he couldn't live with.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.356
The equipment they brought
into that room,

40:37.360 --> 40:38.554
We got nothing off it?

40:38.570 --> 40:39.923
Nothing.

40:39.930 --> 40:41.397
No prints. No trace
back to anywhere.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.560
Who are these people?

40:42.570 --> 40:43.935
We found an earbud

40:43.940 --> 40:45.430
In the general's ear.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.408
Kidnapper was talking
to him the whole time.

40:47.410 --> 40:49.059
What does that tell you?

40:49.080 --> 40:50.729
The kidnapper was
in the general's head

40:50.740 --> 40:52.776
When he killed himself.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.543
This was personal.

41:00.490 --> 41:02.549
It will be terrible
for the general's family

41:02.560 --> 41:03.754
After all this is over

41:03.760 --> 41:05.751
To find out why
he killed himself,

41:05.760 --> 41:07.751
The terrible things he did.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.648
They all looked up to him.

41:09.660 --> 41:12.629
It'll crush them to find out
what kind of man he really was.

41:12.630 --> 41:16.589
You know, it's one thing hacking
into the white house telecom,

41:16.600 --> 41:18.989
But that massacre video
you need,

41:19.010 --> 41:21.934
It's locked inside a cia vault.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.669
How you planning
on getting it out?

41:36.460 --> 41:38.519
Let's place the next call.

41:40.830 --> 41:42.650
