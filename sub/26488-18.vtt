WEBVTT

00:01.747 --> 00:03.120
Climate change

00:03.121 --> 00:05.566
is no longer an abstraction.

00:05.590 --> 00:08.269
It's an accelerating emergency

00:08.293 --> 00:11.806
with devastating consequences
for our planet.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.808
This year alone,

00:13.832 --> 00:16.977
unprecedented drought
scorched Argentina,

00:17.001 --> 00:19.980
record floods ravaged China

00:20.004 --> 00:22.016
and typhoons destroyed Nauru.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.518
We cannot stand idle

00:24.542 --> 00:27.188
while whole nations go homeless.

00:27.212 --> 00:30.424
The U.N. Climate Migration Treaty

00:30.448 --> 00:32.793
will give climate refugees worldwide

00:32.817 --> 00:36.063
the chance to resettle and rebuild.

00:36.087 --> 00:39.633
We have the resources
to save countless lives.

00:39.657 --> 00:42.570
But we must act now

00:42.594 --> 00:46.674
or the dire consequences
of our collective neglect

00:46.698 --> 00:48.732
can never be undone.

00:50.134 --> 00:52.112
It's great, Matt.

00:52.136 --> 00:54.315
Thoughts, everyone?

00:54.339 --> 00:56.317
Undeniably powerful.

00:56.341 --> 00:58.252
Does feel a little, um...

00:58.276 --> 01:00.788
- Geez, what's the word?
- Dreary?

01:00.812 --> 01:01.922
Yeah, that's it.

01:01.946 --> 01:03.023
It's a scooch heavy on catastrophe.

01:03.047 --> 01:04.925
Okay, news flash, guys.

01:04.949 --> 01:06.927
Climate migration is a catastrophe.

01:06.951 --> 01:08.762
The tone is appropriate
to the occasion.

01:08.786 --> 01:11.265
People need to absorb the grimness.

01:11.289 --> 01:12.399
Mission accomplished.

01:12.423 --> 01:14.568
Well, it is a global emergency.
Stakes are high.

01:14.592 --> 01:17.004
Listen, we're all aware
of the gravity of the situation,

01:17.028 --> 01:18.439
but this is about messaging.

01:18.463 --> 01:19.874
You want to energize people,

01:19.898 --> 01:21.642
- not depress them.
- I can confirm.

01:21.666 --> 01:22.977
I am depressed.

01:23.001 --> 01:25.145
Yeah, but sprinkling in

01:25.169 --> 01:28.682
a dash of uplift probably isn't
gonna change that.

01:28.706 --> 01:30.985
This is great work, Matt.

01:31.009 --> 01:33.554
People need to hear this.

01:33.578 --> 01:35.456
Speaking of writing,

01:35.480 --> 01:38.893
did you take a gander

01:38.917 --> 01:40.895
at our faithful
U.N. ambassador's remarks?

01:40.919 --> 01:42.096
Yeah.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.098
They need to be goosed.

01:44.122 --> 01:46.100
- Harriman go long again?
- Let me put it this way.

01:46.124 --> 01:48.936
When Harriman is done speaking,
Miami will be underwater.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.471
You know, he's in the building

01:50.495 --> 01:52.806
working with Eurasian Affairs.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.332
Get with him about cuts?

01:56.467 --> 01:57.811
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Okay, great.

01:57.835 --> 02:00.114
Symposium's in four days.
Thanks, everybody.

02:00.138 --> 02:01.248
It's great work.

02:01.272 --> 02:02.483
Madam Secretary?

02:02.507 --> 02:04.184
- Yeah.
- President Demko

02:04.208 --> 02:05.842
is on SVTC. He says it's urgent.

02:07.111 --> 02:10.257
This was recorded on the floor
of our Senate yesterday.

02:10.281 --> 02:12.893
Dosc. Dosc. Dosc.

02:12.917 --> 02:14.261
43 members

02:14.285 --> 02:16.830
of the Strength and Freedom
Party chanting "Dosc."

02:16.854 --> 02:18.799
- Dosc. Dosc.
- No more.

02:18.823 --> 02:22.403
No more refugees
from the Middle East or Africa.

02:22.427 --> 02:24.371
There have been riots in Kraków.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.674
Anti-immigrant demonstrations
in every major city.

02:26.698 --> 02:27.675
President Demko,

02:27.699 --> 02:29.009
this has already been negotiated.

02:29.033 --> 02:30.945
Poland has agreed to do its part.

02:30.969 --> 02:32.947
Poland already does its part.

02:32.971 --> 02:34.648
More than one million
displaced Ukrainians

02:34.672 --> 02:35.950
have found refuge here.

02:35.974 --> 02:38.252
We are asking you to accept one-tenth

02:38.276 --> 02:39.253
of that number.

02:39.277 --> 02:41.121
100,000 climate migration refugees.

02:41.145 --> 02:44.325
Who will put a strain
on our already battered economy.

02:44.349 --> 02:47.795
Respectfully, sir,
this isn't about your economy,

02:47.819 --> 02:50.230
which has no problem
absorbing large numbers

02:50.254 --> 02:52.066
of fellow Europeans.

02:52.090 --> 02:55.302
It's about catering
to a xenophobic fringe.

02:55.326 --> 02:58.072
Yes. And if I alienate
Strength and Freedom,

02:58.096 --> 03:00.441
my government will fall.

03:00.465 --> 03:02.443
And then you will have no partner.

03:02.467 --> 03:04.111
You've made that argument before.

03:04.135 --> 03:07.414
And it's even truer today
than it was six months ago.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.515
What do you want?

03:08.539 --> 03:10.784
Besides the umbrella
of protection we guarantee

03:10.808 --> 03:13.253
and the base in Sokólka
we just bankrolled.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.888
What's on the table?

03:14.912 --> 03:16.972
I'll look into an aid
package and get back to you.

03:17.749 --> 03:19.326
Some shakedown artist.

03:19.350 --> 03:21.662
One we're stuck with.

03:21.686 --> 03:24.098
As Poland goes, so
goes Eastern Europe.

03:24.122 --> 03:28.068
If he backs out of the accord,
it jeopardizes the agreement.

03:28.092 --> 03:30.070
Yeah, well, he knows that.

03:30.094 --> 03:33.040
Let's give him something
he can sell to his base.

03:33.064 --> 03:37.444
Hmm, like liberation from 50
years of iron curtain servitude?

03:37.468 --> 03:39.647
Might catch more flies with honey.

03:39.671 --> 03:42.216
- Oh, I'll work up some sweeteners.
- Blake.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.718
- Listen, uh, I'm so sorry about before.
- No, don't worry about it.

03:44.742 --> 03:46.420
You were right. Too
much doom and gloom.

03:46.444 --> 03:47.655
Yeah, thanks for the feedback.

03:47.679 --> 03:49.523
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

03:49.547 --> 03:51.058
Hey, are you, uh, headed downstairs?

03:51.082 --> 03:52.326
Uh, yeah. Third floor.

03:52.350 --> 03:53.694
Do you mind stopping on five

03:53.718 --> 03:55.295
- and dropping this off with Harriman?
- Yes.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.864
Great. Thanks.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.766
No, I mean, yes, I mind.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.768
But it's on your way.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.136
To the hospital.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.220
Harriman's territorial.

04:05.229 --> 04:07.307
- Buddy, you got it all wrong.
- So do you.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.543
You want to find someone
for operation human shield,

04:09.567 --> 04:10.978
pick a person who doesn't realize

04:11.002 --> 04:12.346
you have no authority over anything

04:12.370 --> 04:13.514
besides a split infinitive.

04:13.538 --> 04:15.305
I'll split your infinitive.

04:16.641 --> 04:19.086
Okay, great, thank
you so much for that.

04:19.110 --> 04:22.022
Nina. Are you headed downstairs?

04:22.046 --> 04:23.490
Uh, in a bit.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.292
Oh, man, 'cause I am totally swamped.

04:25.316 --> 04:27.017
Can you hold this for a second?

04:29.654 --> 04:31.632
- Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry. Go ahead.

04:31.656 --> 04:33.634
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.

04:35.093 --> 04:36.670
Did you find my black flats?

04:36.694 --> 04:38.272
- Presto.
- Thank you.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.641
I've been hobbling around
on this broken heel all morning.

04:40.665 --> 04:43.277
I think I probably
gave myself scoliosis.

04:43.301 --> 04:44.545
Chicken breast.

04:44.569 --> 04:45.779
Bed of spinach.

04:45.803 --> 04:47.737
Thank you.

04:50.108 --> 04:51.518
Lucas, this is my sister, Stevie.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.820
- Hey.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

04:52.844 --> 04:55.355
- Same.
- Still waiting on your latte.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.681
Perfect.

04:58.683 --> 05:00.561
Ali,

05:00.585 --> 05:01.862
what are you doing?

05:01.886 --> 05:03.163
I believe, in some cultures,

05:03.187 --> 05:05.099
- they call it lunch.
- Yeah, you...

05:05.123 --> 05:07.835
you must realize that
that's, uh, Lucas Morejon,

05:07.859 --> 05:09.670
son of Carlos Morejon?

05:09.694 --> 05:14.007
As in Mom's mortal enemy Morejons?

05:14.031 --> 05:16.910
I'm dating Lucas, not running
for office against him.

05:16.934 --> 05:19.747
And... people will talk.

05:19.771 --> 05:22.750
- It's only been three weeks.
- I'm just saying you should,

05:22.774 --> 05:25.919
you know, probably, like,
give mom a heads-up

05:25.943 --> 05:28.945
'cause, you know, it is what it is.

05:32.850 --> 05:34.394
He is really cute, though.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.396
What's his handle?

05:36.420 --> 05:37.765
@DJTurnItUpYo.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.801
Okay, I have to go.

05:40.825 --> 05:42.236
Thank you.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.971
Yeah.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.572
Ambassador Harriman?

05:45.596 --> 05:48.242
I'm Nina Cummings, Secretary
McCord's new assistant.

05:48.266 --> 05:51.979
She had a few thoughts on your
remarks for the symposium.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.170
Thanks. You can give them here.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.974
Hold it.

05:58.976 --> 06:01.588
These are Madam Secretary's notes?

06:01.612 --> 06:03.891
- Yes.
- It's a hatchet job.

06:03.915 --> 06:06.860
And this looks like
Matt Mahoney's hatchet.

06:06.884 --> 06:11.165
Well, um, Madam Secretary
reposes full confidence in Matt.

06:11.189 --> 06:12.633
Who didn't have the balls

06:12.657 --> 06:15.002
to tell me he was taking
a flamethrower to my work,

06:15.026 --> 06:16.737
so he sent the new girl.

06:16.761 --> 06:18.438
I'm not sure...

06:18.462 --> 06:19.706
I'm not... I-I wasn't...

06:19.730 --> 06:21.809
Oh, I get it.

06:21.833 --> 06:25.712
You didn't know that he was
using you for cover, right?

06:25.736 --> 06:27.714
No.

06:27.738 --> 06:29.550
Since you're still
a babe in the woods,

06:29.574 --> 06:31.351
let me give you some advice.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.288
Washington is dog-eat-dog.

06:34.312 --> 06:35.856
The only way you're gonna survive

06:35.880 --> 06:38.458
in this town, in this building,

06:38.482 --> 06:40.928
is to not let people
walk all over you.

06:40.952 --> 06:42.663
You want to be a professional doormat,

06:42.687 --> 06:44.298
go work in a carpet store.

06:44.322 --> 06:46.356
Capisce?

06:48.860 --> 06:51.294
Whoa. Hey! Hey.

06:52.330 --> 06:53.974
Poland will not open our doors

06:53.998 --> 06:55.776
- to criminals...
- He's delivering these remarks

06:55.800 --> 06:57.591
- in front of the Sejm?
- The Polish Senat.

06:57.592 --> 06:59.379
He convened a joint session
of Parliament.

06:59.403 --> 07:00.948
...but not how to give.

07:00.972 --> 07:03.817
And I promise you this:

07:03.841 --> 07:06.119
I will never sign this treaty

07:06.143 --> 07:09.756
or compromise our future.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.124
Turn it off, Jay.

07:11.148 --> 07:12.326
Strength and Freedom forever.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.493
I thought Demko was reasonable.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.329
He was,

07:15.353 --> 07:18.031
which is what makes his embrace
of the nationalists

07:18.055 --> 07:19.466
so scary.

07:19.490 --> 07:20.968
I-If Demko is willing

07:20.992 --> 07:22.870
to flush bilateral U.S. relations,

07:22.894 --> 07:25.505
Strength and Freedom's
position must be stronger

07:25.529 --> 07:27.407
- than we thought.
- Excuse me, Madam Secretary.

07:27.431 --> 07:29.576
I'm sorry. We're receiving word
from the foreign ministers

07:29.600 --> 07:31.879
of-of Hungary, Romania and Turkey.

07:31.903 --> 07:33.447
They're raising a collective objection

07:33.471 --> 07:35.115
to the refugee resettlement figures.

07:35.139 --> 07:36.416
They're following Demko's lead.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.252
Dam's about to break.

07:38.276 --> 07:40.587
Meaning the treaty will unravel.
The symposium's

07:40.611 --> 07:42.022
- gonna be a wake.
- Not if we can help it.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.790
We need to bring

07:43.814 --> 07:46.059
Poland back into the fold.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.427
I'll talk to Foreign Relations
about sanctions.

07:47.451 --> 07:49.062
Good. But we need

07:49.086 --> 07:50.497
a short-term solution, too.

07:50.521 --> 07:52.933
A domestic figure with enough gravitas

07:52.957 --> 07:55.068
to squeeze Demko on climate migration.

07:55.092 --> 07:57.027
Those folks are in short supply.

07:58.029 --> 08:00.363
But I know just the person.

08:01.365 --> 08:02.743
Madam Secretary.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.611
It's an honor.

08:04.635 --> 08:07.080
- It's been a long time, Lena.
- Six years.

08:07.104 --> 08:09.917
I'm sorry our paths didn't
cross more in Charlottesville.

08:09.941 --> 08:11.285
Well, it's my bad.

08:11.309 --> 08:14.221
I was a math nerd
who tried to stay as far away

08:14.245 --> 08:16.356
from the poli-sci department
as possible.

08:17.448 --> 08:18.926
But watching you put theory

08:18.950 --> 08:21.962
into practice these past
few months has been inspiring.

08:21.986 --> 08:25.632
Thank you. I've moved back to Poznan

08:25.656 --> 08:28.669
where I could speak out
against intolerance and bigotry.

08:28.693 --> 08:31.238
Well, how'd you like a bigger stage?

08:31.262 --> 08:33.373
Like the Climate Migration Symposium.

08:33.397 --> 08:34.573
Thank you,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.510
but I'm an academic, not a politician.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.912
What would I say
to a room full of dignitaries?

08:38.936 --> 08:40.313
What you've been saying.

08:40.337 --> 08:44.318
That your country can't
turn its back on the needy.

08:44.342 --> 08:47.254
That as a region responsible
for an outsized share

08:47.278 --> 08:48.622
of the world's pollution,

08:48.646 --> 08:51.258
Eastern Europe
has a special obligation

08:51.282 --> 08:53.860
to tend to climate change victims.

08:53.884 --> 08:55.295
You want to box Demko in.

08:55.319 --> 08:56.396
Fast.

08:56.420 --> 08:59.032
Because Poland must stay the course

08:59.056 --> 09:01.668
on this deal.
I've been reading your op-eds.

09:01.692 --> 09:02.970
Your YouTube speeches.

09:02.994 --> 09:05.072
When you talk, people listen,

09:05.096 --> 09:07.607
meaning that you have
the moral authority

09:07.631 --> 09:09.543
to nudge him in the right direction.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.144
I won't just nudge.

09:11.168 --> 09:12.913
I'll shove.

09:12.937 --> 09:14.715
Excellent.

09:14.739 --> 09:17.918
We'll make the arrangements,
and when the symposium's done,

09:17.942 --> 09:19.786
I'm gonna cook you a Polish feast.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.077
Looking forward to it.

09:55.741 --> 09:57.426
She's in surgery, Bess.

09:57.427 --> 09:59.139
But she's going to live.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.840
Oh, thank God.

10:00.864 --> 10:03.132
- What do we know?
- Ephraim?

10:04.134 --> 10:06.179
SIGINT decoded a message

10:06.203 --> 10:07.981
from Jan Opalka,

10:08.005 --> 10:11.751
the head of Poland's
domestic intelligence agency,

10:11.775 --> 10:15.413
to Pawel Asnyk and Janusz Lem.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.446
Both Polish Special Forces,

10:17.447 --> 10:20.259
and both apparently off the grid.

10:20.283 --> 10:22.528
- So this was an inside job?
- It would appear so.

10:22.552 --> 10:24.897
Why take her out in broad daylight?

10:24.921 --> 10:26.933
To send a warning to other agitators.

10:26.957 --> 10:28.901
Straight out
of the autocrat's playbook.

10:28.925 --> 10:30.670
Was Demko involved?

10:30.694 --> 10:32.371
No evidence of that yet.

10:32.395 --> 10:34.073
Well, if Demko had no role,

10:34.097 --> 10:35.908
Opalka went rogue,

10:35.932 --> 10:38.577
meaning Demko's hand's
weaker than we thought.

10:38.601 --> 10:39.845
And if Demko's pulling the strings,

10:39.869 --> 10:41.647
further outreach is useless.

10:41.671 --> 10:43.282
Well, either way, Lena's at risk.

10:43.306 --> 10:44.650
Well, first things first.

10:44.674 --> 10:46.352
We need to know whether
we should be working

10:46.376 --> 10:47.920
with the Polish government
or against them.

10:47.944 --> 10:50.823
With your permission, sir,
I'd like to draw Demko out.

10:50.847 --> 10:52.491
I was having the same thought, Bess.

10:52.515 --> 10:53.982
Get to it.

10:55.385 --> 10:58.097
It's-it's appalling, Madam Secretary.

10:58.121 --> 11:00.666
A vicious and unprovoked attack

11:00.690 --> 11:02.902
on free speech, and my
government will not tolerate it.

11:02.926 --> 11:04.203
We're heartened to hear that.

11:04.227 --> 11:06.906
Where are you in apprehending
the would-be assassins?

11:06.930 --> 11:08.741
Uh, the suspects are being

11:08.765 --> 11:11.544
hunted to ground
by our security services

11:11.568 --> 11:12.878
and the ABW.

11:12.902 --> 11:15.081
Your domestic intelligence agency.

11:15.105 --> 11:16.949
Uh, yes. We have CCTV footage

11:16.973 --> 11:19.118
of the car the gunmen used

11:19.142 --> 11:20.709
and leads on two men.

11:22.112 --> 11:24.790
Miroslaw Borek

11:24.814 --> 11:26.192
and Jerzy Wojcik.

11:26.216 --> 11:29.395
Right-wing extremists from
Gdansk seeking to sow unrest.

11:29.419 --> 11:31.897
We can have specialists in-country

11:31.921 --> 11:34.633
co-ordinating with the ABW
by nightfall.

11:34.657 --> 11:37.370
A gracious offer, uh, Director Ware.

11:37.394 --> 11:40.539
But, uh, these criminals
have not yet been located.

11:40.563 --> 11:43.209
But rest assured,
their apprehension is imminent.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.611
Well, please keep us in the loop.

11:45.635 --> 11:47.813
Ms. Kaminska is a U.S. resident.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.815
She means a lot to our country.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.150
And to Poland.

11:51.174 --> 11:53.419
We will not permit

11:53.443 --> 11:56.789
our citizens to be targeted like dogs.

11:56.813 --> 11:58.714
I'll await your update.

11:59.682 --> 12:01.460
Demko lied to my face.

12:01.484 --> 12:04.296
Offered the names of two patsies

12:04.320 --> 12:07.033
when we know damn well
who actually tried to kill Lena.

12:07.057 --> 12:09.335
Meaning he's in on it
or he's running scared...

12:09.359 --> 12:11.195
either way, we have to
get Lena out of there.

12:11.196 --> 12:12.220
How?

12:12.221 --> 12:14.907
Corrupt or weak, Demko's not
just gonna hand her over.

12:14.931 --> 12:17.176
Then we need to consider extraction.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.344
Extraction?

12:18.368 --> 12:20.579
On what basis?

12:20.603 --> 12:22.114
She's a permanent U.S. resident.

12:22.138 --> 12:24.083
And a Polish citizen.

12:24.107 --> 12:26.552
We can't just breach
an ally's sovereignty

12:26.576 --> 12:28.277
and spirit her away.

12:29.279 --> 12:30.823
Henry?

12:30.847 --> 12:32.825
Well, the argument
for extraction rests

12:32.849 --> 12:35.694
on the jeopardy of her
situation, which is substantial,

12:35.718 --> 12:37.930
- and her connection to the U.S.
- Which is tenuous.

12:37.954 --> 12:39.765
She's been a resident of Virginia

12:39.789 --> 12:41.867
for over 14 years.
She owns a home, pays taxes.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.537
- And taught with you at UVA.
- That has nothing to do with it.

12:44.561 --> 12:46.906
Oh, come on, you're straining
to find a U.S. interest

12:46.930 --> 12:48.507
substantial enough to justify

12:48.531 --> 12:51.010
- a controversial, extra-legal measure.
- In order to prevent

12:51.034 --> 12:53.245
another controversial,

12:53.269 --> 12:56.148
- extra-legal measure called murder.
- The fact remains

12:56.172 --> 12:57.817
Lena is not a U.S. citizen,

12:57.841 --> 12:59.718
she never surrendered
her Polish citizenship...

12:59.742 --> 13:01.554
she's still more them than us.

13:01.578 --> 13:03.522
Mr. President, I understand

13:03.546 --> 13:05.724
the appeal of this
course of action, too,

13:05.748 --> 13:07.893
but Russell's concern is valid.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.962
You would be violating the sovereignty

13:09.986 --> 13:11.597
- of a NATO ally.
- What does NATO

13:11.621 --> 13:14.667
stand for if it protects members

13:14.691 --> 13:16.001
who engage in...

13:16.025 --> 13:18.737
- state-sponsored executions?
- Elizabeth,

13:18.761 --> 13:20.906
you're also forgetting
that there's recent precedent

13:20.930 --> 13:22.808
for this question,

13:22.832 --> 13:25.044
and it involves Poland. Exactly.

13:25.068 --> 13:26.445
Even when we were desperate

13:26.469 --> 13:28.481
to get our mitts
on the Polish nationalist

13:28.505 --> 13:30.116
who armed the White House attacker,

13:30.140 --> 13:31.817
we didn't go behind Poland's back.

13:31.841 --> 13:33.319
True, but in the last six months,

13:33.343 --> 13:35.588
Poland has taken a
dark, extremist turn.

13:35.612 --> 13:37.289
It is not the same country,

13:37.313 --> 13:40.726
- and Demko is not the same leader.
- And it's not

13:40.750 --> 13:42.661
just Lena's fate at issue.

13:42.685 --> 13:45.097
It's the fate of our foreign policy.

13:45.121 --> 13:48.234
Sir, this administration
has pushed a narrative

13:48.258 --> 13:50.903
that we cannot turn a
blind eye to others.

13:50.927 --> 13:53.739
Which is exactly what the
climate migration treaty

13:53.763 --> 13:55.107
is all about.

13:55.131 --> 13:57.243
If we abandon Lena,

13:57.267 --> 13:59.678
- we're hypocrites.
- And the inevitable fallout

13:59.702 --> 14:02.081
if we pursue this course of action?

14:02.105 --> 14:04.039
I'll own it.

14:17.745 --> 14:19.518
_

14:19.664 --> 14:22.963
_

14:23.689 --> 14:25.476
_

14:25.529 --> 14:29.292
_

14:29.424 --> 14:30.524
_

14:39.676 --> 14:41.009
We're on.

15:00.563 --> 15:02.575
How's she holding up?

15:04.534 --> 15:06.134
Stable.

15:08.004 --> 15:09.237
Good.

15:10.206 --> 15:12.240
Good.

15:24.052 --> 15:27.426
_

15:40.925 --> 15:42.345
_

15:43.079 --> 15:44.490
_

15:56.386 --> 15:58.631
Just crossed the German border.

15:58.655 --> 16:00.966
She's safe.

16:00.990 --> 16:02.234
Well done.

16:02.258 --> 16:05.104
Yes, indeed.

16:05.128 --> 16:06.905
Now we just have

16:06.929 --> 16:09.908
to explain to the leadership why
we cut them out of the loop,

16:09.932 --> 16:12.478
inform NATO we kidnapped

16:12.502 --> 16:15.381
an ally's citizen,
and tell Poland we violated

16:15.405 --> 16:17.449
their sovereignty.

16:17.473 --> 16:21.987
And... do it all three days
before the start of a conference

16:22.011 --> 16:24.790
designed to showcase
the administration's ability

16:24.814 --> 16:27.015
to build coalitions.

16:29.719 --> 16:32.754
God help the liberal
world order, Bess.

16:39.537 --> 16:40.881
Ma'am, Russell is melting down.

16:40.905 --> 16:42.316
We're being hammered

16:42.340 --> 16:43.951
in Die Welt, The Daily Telegraph,
- Exactly.

16:43.975 --> 16:46.368
- I. Figaro and the Journal.
- Congressional leadership

16:46.369 --> 16:48.588
is launching broadsides at the
administration for not consulting them

16:48.589 --> 16:50.957
- prior to the extraction.
- And POTUS wants our policy position

16:50.958 --> 16:52.029
as to the justifiability

16:52.030 --> 16:54.676
- of unilateral action.
- An Office of Legal Counsel opinion

16:54.700 --> 16:56.778
- giving us cover.
- Ah, this is crazy.

16:56.802 --> 16:58.980
Your 8:15 cruller.

16:59.004 --> 17:00.982
Ah... yeah,

17:01.006 --> 17:02.550
I don't really have an appetite.

17:02.574 --> 17:04.953
- How's Lena?
- Conscious and resting comfortably

17:04.977 --> 17:06.788
at Ramstein Air Force Base.

17:06.811 --> 17:09.089
Okay, good. I want
to send her some flowers.

17:09.114 --> 17:10.325
Something that says...

17:10.348 --> 17:12.460
"Sorry you got shot,
glad you didn't die"?

17:12.483 --> 17:14.729
Maybe something
a little bit more lyrical.

17:14.752 --> 17:16.030
- Thanks.
- Okay.

17:16.054 --> 17:18.665
Not that I have to ask,
but where does this put

17:18.690 --> 17:20.602
- the climate migration deal?
- On life support.

17:20.626 --> 17:22.537
Demko's claiming that the
extraction abrogated it.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.472
Don't ask me his reasoning;
he doesn't have any.

17:24.496 --> 17:26.608
- Romania, Hungary, Turkey are
throwing in with him. - We really need

17:26.632 --> 17:27.790
those sanctions against Poland, and we

17:27.814 --> 17:29.143
- need them yesterday.
- I've got calls in

17:29.167 --> 17:30.245
to congressional
leadership. Don't worry.

17:30.269 --> 17:31.679
- All right, well, follow up.
- All right.

17:31.703 --> 17:32.714
- Uh, ma'am?
- Yeah?

17:32.738 --> 17:34.141
The NATO secretary general

17:34.142 --> 17:35.656
is already in town for the symposium

17:35.657 --> 17:37.223
- and wants to see you immediately.
- Okay, that's great.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.787
Bring him in. We got to make sure
that we have NATO'S backing, okay?

17:39.811 --> 17:41.222
- Yep.
- Yep. Thank you.

17:41.223 --> 17:43.091
Article Five?

17:43.115 --> 17:44.926
Mr. Secretary General,

17:44.950 --> 17:47.161
y-you have to be kidding me.

17:47.185 --> 17:49.464
The Polish government filed
a complaint this morning.

17:49.488 --> 17:52.300
The council is duty-bound
to take it seriously.

17:52.324 --> 17:53.534
Article Five commits each member

17:53.558 --> 17:55.370
to consider an armed attack
against one member

17:55.394 --> 17:57.338
to be an armed attack
against them all.

17:57.362 --> 18:00.775
- And we didn't attack anyone.
- Warsaw is arguing

18:00.799 --> 18:02.543
that your breach of Polish sovereignty

18:02.567 --> 18:05.313
- amounted to a hostile incursion.
- We both know

18:05.337 --> 18:08.683
Article Five is not intended
to be invoked

18:08.707 --> 18:11.586
by one member against another.

18:11.610 --> 18:14.022
In the normal course
of affairs, I'd agree.

18:14.046 --> 18:16.491
The point isn't that
your country is in danger

18:16.515 --> 18:18.559
of being sanctioned or
expelled, Madam Secretary.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.061
Then why are we dignifying

18:20.085 --> 18:21.829
this publicity stunt?

18:21.853 --> 18:23.331
Because...

18:23.355 --> 18:26.768
without solidarity, NATO
has no reason for being.

18:26.792 --> 18:29.671
Disunity is bad for the alliance

18:29.695 --> 18:31.572
and good for our enemies.

18:31.596 --> 18:33.931
What do you need me to do?

18:37.269 --> 18:40.248
Smooth things over with Demko.

18:40.272 --> 18:42.206
Whatever it takes.

18:50.549 --> 18:52.894
Get with Ephraim Ware.

18:52.918 --> 18:55.096
Before I offer Demko an olive branch,

18:55.120 --> 18:57.498
- I want an intelligence update.
- Will do.

18:57.522 --> 18:58.666
Nina?

18:58.690 --> 19:00.168
Ma'am.

19:00.192 --> 19:02.937
Will you set up a SVTC call
with Demko, please?

19:02.961 --> 19:04.361
Yes, ma'am.

19:05.207 --> 19:08.432
Oh. Matt said you
gave Harriman the notes.

19:08.433 --> 19:09.711
How'd he take it?

19:09.735 --> 19:11.702
The ambassador was very gracious.

19:12.738 --> 19:14.939
That's good to hear. Thank you.

19:16.241 --> 19:17.819
This is an outrage!

19:17.843 --> 19:20.154
Your objection is duly noted, sir.

19:20.178 --> 19:23.291
Return the Polish citizen
you kidnapped immediately,

19:23.315 --> 19:24.592
so we can safeguard her.

19:24.616 --> 19:27.295
I think Lena feels safe
right where she is.

19:27.319 --> 19:28.730
Then we have nothing to talk about.

19:28.754 --> 19:30.223
How about your collusion

19:30.224 --> 19:32.500
in the attempted murder
of a prominent critic?

19:32.524 --> 19:35.370
I don't know where you get
your information.

19:35.394 --> 19:37.705
Let me stop you right there.

19:37.729 --> 19:40.608
In my experience, no innocent man

19:40.632 --> 19:42.977
has ever uttered those words.

19:43.001 --> 19:44.712
You're the president.

19:44.736 --> 19:47.382
You may not have ordered this murder,

19:47.406 --> 19:49.650
but you're behind the cover-up.

19:49.674 --> 19:52.053
That makes you corrupt, complicit

19:52.077 --> 19:54.489
and staggeringly unfit to lead.

19:54.513 --> 19:55.656
So we're gonna

19:55.680 --> 19:57.225
make it easy on you.

19:57.249 --> 19:59.727
You're going to extradite
everyone involved

19:59.751 --> 20:01.195
in Lena's attack.

20:01.219 --> 20:02.864
I will do no such thing.

20:02.888 --> 20:04.932
Then you'll call for elections.

20:04.956 --> 20:07.835
- There are two years left in my term.
- Not anymore.

20:07.859 --> 20:11.005
Because the third thing
you're going to do is resign.

20:11.029 --> 20:13.040
Or we're going to share

20:13.064 --> 20:15.510
evidence of your roll in
this horrible conspiracy

20:15.534 --> 20:17.345
with the Polish media.

20:17.369 --> 20:19.947
You are overplaying your hand,
Madam Secretary.

20:19.971 --> 20:21.716
Try me.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.117
I will.

20:23.141 --> 20:25.653
Leak this supposed evidence.

20:25.677 --> 20:28.723
Given America's brazen violation
of our sovereignty,

20:28.747 --> 20:31.192
you will be easy to discredit!

20:31.216 --> 20:34.595
So much for catching
more flies with honey.

20:34.619 --> 20:37.698
Climate change. Bees are dying.

20:37.722 --> 20:40.468
How'd things go with Demko?

20:40.492 --> 20:42.937
Oh, peachy.

20:42.961 --> 20:46.541
- You told him to resign, didn't you?
- Yes, I did, and he's

20:46.565 --> 20:49.744
digging in... meaning
the treaty'll be toast

20:49.768 --> 20:51.712
before he ever is.

20:51.736 --> 20:53.781
- What do you have for me?
- More toast.

20:53.805 --> 20:55.783
Sanctions stalled out in committee.

20:55.807 --> 20:58.219
Callister and his minions.
Russell called the principals

20:58.243 --> 21:01.278
to the White House... he's
gonna push a charm offensive.

21:03.048 --> 21:05.449
Ignorant. Blinkered. Short-sighted.

21:06.585 --> 21:08.763
- Are you finished?
- Senator Callister,

21:08.787 --> 21:10.097
I'm just getting started.

21:10.121 --> 21:12.200
Well, then let me,
uh, save you some time.

21:12.224 --> 21:13.835
We have zero interest in sanctioning

21:13.859 --> 21:17.271
an important NATO ally
based on dubious intelligence.

21:17.295 --> 21:18.673
Well, there's nothing
dubious about it.

21:18.697 --> 21:21.231
Review it. I'll wait.

21:23.969 --> 21:25.279
We've already been briefed

21:25.303 --> 21:27.215
on President Demko's
alleged involvement

21:27.239 --> 21:29.283
in this assassination attempt,

21:29.307 --> 21:30.718
and I am not convinced.

21:30.742 --> 21:32.587
I think what Chairman Callister

21:32.611 --> 21:35.857
- is trying to say...
- I get it, Senator Morejon.

21:35.881 --> 21:38.092
Foreign Relations would rather side

21:38.116 --> 21:40.595
with the craven leader of a country
trending towards extremism

21:40.619 --> 21:42.763
than our own intelligence services.

21:42.787 --> 21:44.899
- And president.
- If that president

21:44.923 --> 21:46.634
is so interested in our support,

21:46.658 --> 21:49.437
why didn't he consult us
before this mission?

21:49.461 --> 21:51.772
Because time was of the essence.

21:51.796 --> 21:55.476
Because he knew we wouldn't risk
our international standing

21:55.500 --> 21:57.678
to rescue an unknown Polish radical...

21:57.702 --> 22:00.481
Lena Kaminska is a
permanent U.S. resident.

22:00.505 --> 22:03.050
Who moved back to her home
country to agitate. Russell,

22:03.074 --> 22:05.520
we keep going round and round on this,

22:05.544 --> 22:07.822
and it's just not productive.

22:07.846 --> 22:09.390
Tell President Dalton

22:09.414 --> 22:10.892
we look forward to working with him

22:10.916 --> 22:14.151
to further genuine American interests.

22:17.022 --> 22:18.922
Owen.

22:25.196 --> 22:27.775
I know you're running for president.

22:27.799 --> 22:29.710
And opposing us...

22:29.734 --> 22:31.913
makes for good copy.

22:31.937 --> 22:34.815
But when this country doesn't
speak with a single voice

22:34.839 --> 22:37.952
in the conduct of its foreign policy,

22:37.976 --> 22:40.621
we are weakened as a nation.

22:40.645 --> 22:42.557
You can make a difference here.

22:42.581 --> 22:44.848
I'm already making a difference.

22:49.187 --> 22:50.665
I told you I'm not interested
in your Polish dossier.

22:50.689 --> 22:51.999
Good.

22:52.023 --> 22:54.224
'Cause this one's about you.

23:04.436 --> 23:06.480
If that's all you got...

23:06.504 --> 23:09.884
you've already lost.

23:09.908 --> 23:11.775
Bye, Russell.

23:18.717 --> 23:21.495
Oh. Hey, Peter.

23:21.519 --> 23:24.165
Why is the coffee on this floor
so damn good?

23:24.189 --> 23:25.833
Blake Moran.

23:25.857 --> 23:28.836
He hand grinds and slow drips.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.706
Slow grinds,

23:31.730 --> 23:33.240
hand drips.

23:33.264 --> 23:34.575
Either way,

23:34.599 --> 23:35.576
it's nectar.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.978
Mmm. I'll say.

23:37.002 --> 23:40.214
I have updated symposium remarks
for your office to review.

23:40.238 --> 23:42.283
Well, you may need
to tailor them a bit.

23:42.307 --> 23:44.085
Eastern Europe has just...

23:44.109 --> 23:46.087
schnitzeled away.

23:46.111 --> 23:47.421
I'm happy to make adjustments.

23:47.445 --> 23:48.756
Not what I hear.

23:48.780 --> 23:51.525
- So Nina threw me under the bus.
- No.

23:51.549 --> 23:52.927
She covered for you.

23:52.951 --> 23:54.395
Said you were gracious.

23:54.419 --> 23:56.464
You are many things, Peter,

23:56.488 --> 23:57.999
most of them admirable.

23:58.023 --> 24:01.535
Calling you gracious is
like calling the Pope saucy.

24:01.559 --> 24:03.671
I was giving her some advice.

24:03.695 --> 24:06.674
Next thing, here come the waterworks.

24:06.698 --> 24:08.542
You made her cry?

24:08.566 --> 24:10.011
- No.
- Peter.

24:10.035 --> 24:11.278
Maybe.

24:11.302 --> 24:13.748
Nina is a crucial member of my team.

24:13.772 --> 24:15.716
You need to make this right.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.585
What do you want me to do?

24:17.609 --> 24:18.719
You're our U.N. ambassador.

24:18.743 --> 24:19.954
Try some diplomacy.

24:19.978 --> 24:21.088
Yes, ma'am.

24:21.112 --> 24:23.090
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

24:23.114 --> 24:25.092
- Please, please.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. I'm on it.

24:25.116 --> 24:28.596
Oh, I saw that piece on,
uh, Lucas Morejon and Alison.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.531
It was really sweet.

24:30.555 --> 24:33.367
And-and very evolved of you
not to kick up a fuss.

24:33.391 --> 24:35.102
What are you talking about?

24:35.126 --> 24:36.871
The Capital Couplings thing.

24:36.895 --> 24:38.739
It was really-really a sweet item.

24:38.763 --> 24:40.074
The whole Romeo and Juliet angle,

24:40.098 --> 24:41.565
love finding a way.

24:42.867 --> 24:45.007
This is the first you're
hearing about it, isn't it?

24:46.471 --> 24:48.783
Fresh pot coming up!

24:48.807 --> 24:50.751
"It's the Hatfields

24:50.775 --> 24:52.119
"and the McCords,

24:52.143 --> 24:54.655
"the offspring of two
prominent political adversaries

24:54.679 --> 24:57.825
canoodling while their parents
eviscerate each other."

24:58.816 --> 25:00.329
I am watching the Western coalition

25:00.330 --> 25:01.345
- just...
- Don't. Don't.

25:01.346 --> 25:02.663
...crumble before my eyes.

25:02.687 --> 25:04.265
And now I have to worry

25:04.289 --> 25:05.766
- about being ambushed by...
- "Ambushed"?

25:05.790 --> 25:07.234
- ...tabloid nonsense?
- We really just started dating.

25:07.258 --> 25:08.335
I was going to tell you.

25:08.359 --> 25:10.304
- Stevie can vouch for that.
- You knew?

25:10.328 --> 25:12.506
- Well, not for that long.
- Oblivious and proud.

25:12.530 --> 25:14.008
Yeah, of course you don't have that

25:14.032 --> 25:16.177
- problem. You need a date first.
- Leave him alone.

25:16.201 --> 25:17.710
- Both of you, cut it out.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys,

25:17.711 --> 25:20.281
don't get this twisted. We know
that you all have good judgment.

25:20.305 --> 25:21.682
- Yes. Mostly.
- Now it's a whole new deal.

25:21.706 --> 25:23.617
Running for president, you have a target

25:23.641 --> 25:25.319
- on your back.
- ...political opponent.

25:25.343 --> 25:27.121
Now we have to vet everyone
we're dating with you guys?

25:27.145 --> 25:28.122
- 'Cause I'm not...
- What?

25:28.146 --> 25:29.924
- No. Nobody is saying that.
- No. No.

25:29.948 --> 25:31.158
Why am I being lectured?

25:31.182 --> 25:32.860
- It's not a lecture.
- Because I didn't rat out

25:32.884 --> 25:34.128
- my sister?
- It's not about ratting!

25:34.152 --> 25:35.629
- Who's ratting?
- I mean, I told Ali

25:35.653 --> 25:38.199
that she can't have been
dating Lucas for three weeks

25:38.223 --> 25:39.767
- and not tell you.
- Three weeks?

25:39.791 --> 25:41.869
- Stevie, you are a lousy rat!
- This is better

25:41.893 --> 25:43.804
- than The Real Housewives.
- Jason, just stop it.

25:43.828 --> 25:45.773
- That's not... that's not...
- No. No, no, no. What, what?

25:45.797 --> 25:47.975
I'm-I'm the bad guy?
She's dating the spawn of Satan.

25:47.999 --> 25:49.376
And this one hooks up with, what,

25:49.400 --> 25:50.878
- old men and drug addicts?
- Whoa.

25:50.902 --> 25:52.747
- Oh, hey, hey, hey! Wait, hey!
- Oh! Okay, okay!

25:52.771 --> 25:54.281
Hey, simmer down now!
Come on. Don't...

25:54.305 --> 25:55.305
Stevie!

25:57.041 --> 25:59.687
Do... I have to stay?

25:59.711 --> 26:02.479
No. Good talk. Thanks.

26:04.115 --> 26:05.292
Well...

26:06.384 --> 26:08.162
...that went well.

26:10.789 --> 26:12.233
Perfect.

26:12.257 --> 26:14.168
Yes, Russell.

26:14.192 --> 26:16.470
Ramsey Peters. Right now.

26:16.494 --> 26:18.528
Hold on.

26:19.998 --> 26:21.976
It's a badge of pride, Ramsey.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.644
I-It's not a mark of shame
or anything.

26:23.668 --> 26:26.347
Um, I have longtime friends
in a group called Eros Europa.

26:26.371 --> 26:28.315
- They back Polish candidates...
- Wow.

26:28.339 --> 26:30.184
...who promote Western culture.

26:30.208 --> 26:33.320
Candidates who are affiliated with the,

26:33.344 --> 26:34.822
uh, Strength and Freedom Party, right?

26:34.846 --> 26:37.057
Yes, an organization
this country needs

26:37.081 --> 26:39.360
- to align itself with, as I've said before.
- So much for Callister's

26:39.384 --> 26:41.362
- dog whistle.
- Yeah.

26:41.386 --> 26:43.831
This time, he brought the dog.

26:43.855 --> 26:44.850
Why own it now?

26:44.851 --> 26:47.034
Because I don't want
my political enemies

26:47.058 --> 26:48.435
to use it against me.

26:48.459 --> 26:50.571
When he's talking about his

26:50.595 --> 26:51.906
political enemies...

26:51.930 --> 26:53.741
I showed him my oppo,

26:53.765 --> 26:55.543
hoped he'd stand down.

26:55.567 --> 26:56.544
Instead,

26:56.568 --> 26:59.013
he... got in front of it.

26:59.037 --> 27:00.514
Callister's fearless, Elizabeth.

27:00.538 --> 27:01.916
He's playing
by a different set of rules.

27:01.940 --> 27:04.919
Unless we figure out a way
to fight him, he's gonna

27:04.943 --> 27:07.354
seriously compromise
this administration's agenda

27:07.378 --> 27:09.290
and your political future.

27:09.314 --> 27:11.692
- So what's our next move?
- You tell me.

27:11.716 --> 27:13.894
Remember you said you'd own the
fallout from this extraction?

27:13.918 --> 27:16.030
You do!

27:16.054 --> 27:19.633
...candidate with nothing to hide.

27:19.657 --> 27:21.458
I can't argue with that.

27:24.289 --> 27:25.879
So, what can I do for you, Henry?

27:25.880 --> 27:27.630
I've got to talk to you
about a private matter,

27:27.631 --> 27:29.175
Carlos, that involves our kids.

27:29.176 --> 27:30.511
You know they've been dating.

27:30.512 --> 27:32.323
Yeah.

27:32.347 --> 27:35.726
I think everyone does
at this point, huh?

27:35.750 --> 27:37.928
Look, I know that you
and Elizabeth aren't exactly

27:37.952 --> 27:39.397
politically simpatico...

27:39.421 --> 27:41.666
Elizabeth worried that
I might embarrass her

27:41.690 --> 27:43.768
with intel my son has passed on to me

27:43.792 --> 27:45.503
from your unsuspecting daughter?

27:45.527 --> 27:48.239
Yes. No. Well,
hearing you say it makes it...

27:48.263 --> 27:50.074
makes me embarrassed that we would

27:50.098 --> 27:52.737
- even entertain that thought.
- Don't be.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.445
Paranoia comes with the territory.

27:54.469 --> 27:57.038
Look, what we're really
worried about is our kid.

27:57.039 --> 27:58.872
Our-our kids.

27:59.934 --> 28:01.444
We tried to talk to them.

28:01.445 --> 28:02.787
We feel like we blew it
right out of the gate.

28:02.811 --> 28:06.123
My first Senate run, my opponent,

28:06.147 --> 28:07.558
the stuff he came at me with.

28:07.582 --> 28:11.228
That my father was
a Castro sympathizer.

28:11.252 --> 28:14.632
That-that Vicki's brother
was working for the KGB,

28:14.656 --> 28:18.069
because he once went to Moscow
for a chess tournament.

28:18.093 --> 28:20.304
My God.

28:20.328 --> 28:22.139
It was all it took
not to break his nose.

28:22.163 --> 28:25.109
Well, you're defending family.
Primal instinct takes over.

28:25.133 --> 28:27.678
It does, because family is sacrosanct.

28:27.702 --> 28:30.247
Which is, you know,
why I want to assure you

28:30.271 --> 28:32.750
that, in spite of the
professional differences

28:32.774 --> 28:36.787
I might have with your wife,
kids are off-limits, period.

28:36.811 --> 28:39.557
Thank you. I appreciate that.

28:39.581 --> 28:45.196
I would be remiss if I didn't
bring up one other matter.

28:45.220 --> 28:48.232
- The Polish sanctions.
- Aha.

28:48.256 --> 28:51.102
Of course, yeah, you're the
president's senior advisor.

28:51.126 --> 28:53.237
I should have assumed
the overture was imminent.

28:53.261 --> 28:55.406
But I'll tell you that

28:55.430 --> 28:57.541
I am firmly with my
caucus on this one.

28:57.565 --> 28:59.076
You shouldn't be.

28:59.100 --> 29:03.114
Callister is going all in
on nationalism.

29:03.138 --> 29:06.317
He's appealing to hate,
fear, prejudice...

29:06.341 --> 29:07.785
Yeah, that is one view.

29:07.809 --> 29:10.454
The other is that he's tapping
into a populist vein.

29:10.478 --> 29:12.574
One that could actually
take him to the White House.

29:12.575 --> 29:14.859
And take this country
into a dystopian future.

29:14.883 --> 29:18.295
Be that as it may,
he's chair of Foreign Relations,

29:18.319 --> 29:19.964
and he's a top voice in the party.

29:19.988 --> 29:23.501
That makes him powerful, not right.

29:23.525 --> 29:26.537
Today he's backing
extremism in Poland,

29:26.561 --> 29:28.205
tomorrow it could be
Russia or North Korea.

29:28.206 --> 29:29.407
Come on, Henry,

29:29.431 --> 29:31.175
he's not an enemy of democracy.

29:31.199 --> 29:33.577
No, not if we curtail
his worst impulses.

29:33.601 --> 29:36.870
Yeah, he may be president,

29:37.429 --> 29:39.020
but someone else might be as well.

29:39.021 --> 29:40.614
You asking me to hedge my bets?

29:40.615 --> 29:44.494
No, Senator, I'm asking
you to go all in

29:44.495 --> 29:46.590
on our shared democratic ideals.

29:46.614 --> 29:49.960
Without them, NATO's just an acronym.

29:49.984 --> 29:54.187
Like the U.N., or the USA.

29:56.758 --> 29:58.769
Thanks for seeing me.

29:58.793 --> 30:01.071
Tell Lucas he's welcome
in our home anytime.

30:01.095 --> 30:02.239
So are you and Vicki.

30:02.263 --> 30:04.264
Thanks.

30:06.301 --> 30:08.879
Oh, Ambassador, hi.

30:08.903 --> 30:11.348
Um, sorry, I'm afraid
we need the room.

30:11.372 --> 30:13.941
Actually, I'm here to see you.

30:16.044 --> 30:18.823
What... Is that for me? What is it?

30:18.847 --> 30:20.491
Chocolate.

30:20.515 --> 30:22.493
From five different countries.

30:22.517 --> 30:26.263
- It was six, but it's a long walk here.
- Thanks.

30:26.287 --> 30:28.499
But I wasn't crying
because of you, Mr. Ambassador.

30:28.523 --> 30:30.935
Oh, well, what then?

30:30.959 --> 30:33.938
I work 16-hour days for table scraps.

30:33.962 --> 30:35.439
My mom needs physical therapy,

30:35.463 --> 30:36.874
my kid sister needs rehab.

30:36.898 --> 30:38.242
I live with three roommates,

30:38.266 --> 30:40.311
one of whom is an insomniac
with a drum kit.

30:40.335 --> 30:45.082
And I am the first one in my family...

30:45.106 --> 30:47.051
- to go to college.
- Damn.

30:47.075 --> 30:49.987
- That's a lot on your plate.
- Yeah.

30:50.011 --> 30:52.052
So I can't mess this job up.

30:52.053 --> 30:54.031
And you won't.

30:54.055 --> 30:58.035
Because working-class kids like us

30:58.059 --> 31:00.638
don't squander their opportunities.

31:00.662 --> 31:01.972
This girl won't.

31:01.996 --> 31:05.342
But the fear of failure...

31:05.366 --> 31:06.944
Never goes away.

31:06.968 --> 31:09.046
But you learn to cope with it.

31:09.070 --> 31:11.949
I cope with it by being a hard-ass.

31:11.973 --> 31:16.353
Yeah, um, killing with kindness
is more my thing.

31:16.377 --> 31:19.556
Yeah. You'll get the hard-ass part.

31:19.580 --> 31:23.394
Because when you're
not to the manner born,

31:23.418 --> 31:25.118
you've got to fight for everything.

31:27.255 --> 31:30.067
And it starts with
standing up for yourself.

31:32.493 --> 31:34.561
I hate chocolate.

31:40.568 --> 31:41.768
That's a good start.

31:45.273 --> 31:47.124
Following Poland's lead,

31:47.125 --> 31:50.421
Slovakia, Greece and Serbia

31:50.445 --> 31:54.425
are now demanding
more remuneration per refugee.

31:54.449 --> 31:56.060
That's extortion.

31:56.084 --> 31:57.728
It'll blow up the
climate migration deal.

31:57.752 --> 31:59.229
That's precisely the point.

31:59.253 --> 32:01.498
Yeah?

32:01.522 --> 32:04.268
I have Senator Morejon for you.

32:04.292 --> 32:05.969
Put him through.

32:05.993 --> 32:07.538
Senator?

32:07.562 --> 32:08.572
Millman,

32:08.596 --> 32:10.774
Werner, Isenstadt,

32:10.798 --> 32:11.775
Pilkner.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.210
Took some heavy lifting...

32:13.234 --> 32:15.412
and Callister put a price
on my head...

32:15.436 --> 32:17.247
but I got you your 60 votes.

32:17.271 --> 32:19.583
A filibuster-proof majority.

32:19.607 --> 32:22.486
You're supporting the sanctions?

32:22.510 --> 32:24.655
Wh-Why the change of heart?

32:24.679 --> 32:28.192
Henry can make a pretty
convincing moral argument.

32:28.216 --> 32:30.194
But that's only part of it.

32:30.218 --> 32:31.695
What's the other part?

32:31.719 --> 32:32.996
Well, on the off chance

32:33.020 --> 32:34.765
that we're sitting
across from each other

32:34.789 --> 32:37.134
years from now with our grandkids...

32:37.158 --> 32:39.603
I want you to pick up the check.

32:39.627 --> 32:41.261
Done.

32:46.634 --> 32:48.946
Thank you, Frank.

32:48.970 --> 32:50.214
Hey.

32:50.238 --> 32:52.015
Oh, God.

32:52.039 --> 32:54.051
Hi, you beautiful man.

32:54.075 --> 32:55.986
Babe.

32:56.010 --> 32:58.455
The sanctions are already working.

32:58.479 --> 33:00.791
Demko's under a lot
of pressure, and... Wha-What?

33:00.815 --> 33:03.327
Uh, why don't you look happy?

33:03.351 --> 33:07.524
INN's reporting Demko just
declared a national emergency.

33:07.525 --> 33:09.399
He's mobilizing the armed forces.

33:09.423 --> 33:13.871
So we may have given him
an excuse to consolidate power.

33:13.895 --> 33:16.015
The symposium's tomorrow.

33:16.016 --> 33:18.575
- Damn it.
- If Poland isn't brought to heel, then...

33:18.599 --> 33:20.844
all of this work and the treaty,

33:20.868 --> 33:22.179
it's just...

33:23.771 --> 33:26.339
Hi, sweetie.

33:27.341 --> 33:28.575
Mom.

33:29.577 --> 33:30.944
Go.

33:35.082 --> 33:37.127
You broke up with your boyfriend?

33:37.151 --> 33:39.163
Lucas wasn't my boyfriend.

33:39.187 --> 33:40.764
But yes.

33:40.788 --> 33:43.133
Ali, that's not what I wanted.

33:43.157 --> 33:45.536
All that stuff you said
about spotlights

33:45.560 --> 33:48.172
and responsibilities, you're right.

33:48.196 --> 33:50.073
We have to think strategically now.

33:50.097 --> 33:52.309
And the Morejons are the enemies.

33:52.333 --> 33:53.944
No, they're not.

33:53.968 --> 33:55.946
They're...

33:55.970 --> 33:59.716
I don't know how to do this.

33:59.740 --> 34:02.052
Do what?

34:02.076 --> 34:04.621
Run for president while being a mom

34:04.645 --> 34:06.924
and a wife and a...

34:10.117 --> 34:12.896
We're just gonna have to
work this out together,

34:12.920 --> 34:15.232
as a family.

34:15.255 --> 34:17.701
What about what you said?

34:17.725 --> 34:21.572
Well, we were trying
to preach caution,

34:21.596 --> 34:24.141
and I'm not going back on that.

34:24.165 --> 34:28.445
But the takeaway isn't that
you can't live your life.

34:28.469 --> 34:31.215
The day that my daughter
can't date whoever she wants

34:31.239 --> 34:33.340
is the day I find another job.

34:35.328 --> 34:39.389
- You'll really dig Lucas.
- Yeah?

34:39.414 --> 34:41.658
Did you ever meet a person that...

34:41.681 --> 34:43.927
changes the way you look at the world?

34:43.951 --> 34:46.396
Inspires you to...

34:46.420 --> 34:48.431
be a better version of yourself?

34:48.456 --> 34:50.100
Yeah.

34:50.123 --> 34:52.369
I married him.

34:56.764 --> 34:58.999
You're right.

35:10.378 --> 35:12.789
- You read the fourth draft of my speech.
- Yes.

35:12.813 --> 35:14.258
It's great.

35:14.282 --> 35:16.193
Well, 'cause I took Matt's notes.

35:16.217 --> 35:17.661
Both rounds of them.

35:17.685 --> 35:18.996
It's, uh, tight.

35:19.020 --> 35:20.764
It's varnished.

35:20.788 --> 35:22.889
I...

35:24.692 --> 35:26.270
And I'm not gonna do it.

35:26.294 --> 35:27.660
What happened?

35:28.829 --> 35:32.542
Our climate migration
coalition is crumbling.

35:32.566 --> 35:36.113
We-we need someone
who can sway public opinion,

35:36.137 --> 35:37.581
not just...

35:37.605 --> 35:40.117
with the delegates, but abroad.

35:40.141 --> 35:42.642
And I'm just a bureaucrat.

35:43.644 --> 35:46.023
And a damn fine one.

35:46.047 --> 35:49.226
But I need this one person

35:49.250 --> 35:51.895
who can change hearts and minds.

35:51.919 --> 35:53.563
A voice...

35:53.587 --> 35:55.065
that can't be ignored.

35:55.089 --> 35:56.667
That's a tall order.

35:56.691 --> 35:59.092
- Yes.
- Who have you got?

36:00.094 --> 36:01.972
Peter Harriman...

36:01.996 --> 36:04.697
meet Lena Kaminska.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.645
Ms. Kaminska.

36:08.669 --> 36:10.347
It's an honor.

36:10.371 --> 36:12.605
The pleasure is mine.

36:18.507 --> 36:20.529
My name is Lena Kaminska.

36:20.530 --> 36:22.642
I am lucky to be here today.

36:22.666 --> 36:24.811
But I am only here
because someone thought

36:24.835 --> 36:27.680
I was worth saving.

36:27.704 --> 36:29.882
And if I am worth saving,

36:29.906 --> 36:31.751
everyone is.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.753
Governments like my own,

36:33.777 --> 36:36.489
who care more
about silencing their critics

36:36.513 --> 36:39.359
than helping victims, must change.

36:39.383 --> 36:41.861
Or be changed.

36:41.885 --> 36:43.663
Because we can only solve

36:43.687 --> 36:46.366
the climate migration crisis together.

36:46.390 --> 36:50.970
An acknowledgement that if
tragedy doesn't respect borders,

36:50.994 --> 36:53.639
neither can we.

36:53.663 --> 36:56.542
Nationalism doesn't work.

36:56.566 --> 37:01.080
But as your presence
today testifies...

37:01.104 --> 37:03.072
Internationalism does.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.726
Three hours. Three hours

37:13.750 --> 37:15.895
for Lena's speech to go viral.

37:15.919 --> 37:18.064
100,000 people

37:18.088 --> 37:22.468
are protesting outside
the Presidential Palace.

37:22.492 --> 37:25.705
Demko holed up like a coward
in his residence in Belweder,

37:25.729 --> 37:28.307
but he has officially
submitted his resignation,

37:28.331 --> 37:30.710
and Polish elections are set for June.

37:30.734 --> 37:32.078
And...

37:32.102 --> 37:34.047
the climate migration treaty

37:34.071 --> 37:37.039
has 164 signatories.

37:38.041 --> 37:39.842
Well done, Madam Secretary.

37:41.078 --> 37:43.723
All I did was give Lena a platform.

37:43.747 --> 37:45.691
Mm-hmm, you did a lot more than that.

37:45.715 --> 37:48.417
You had the wisdom to save her.

37:49.419 --> 37:51.864
Well, Western history

37:51.888 --> 37:53.566
is...

37:53.590 --> 37:57.770
premised on the notion that...

37:57.794 --> 38:00.006
one person can make a difference.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.707
Well, she can.

38:01.731 --> 38:04.377
And she will.

38:04.401 --> 38:06.946
Also, it's, uh...

38:06.970 --> 38:10.306
it's high time I
acknowledge something.

38:11.708 --> 38:16.022
I realize our relationship can
be somewhat antagonistic.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.990
Oh. Well...

38:18.014 --> 38:20.827
not exactly breaking news. No, I know.

38:20.851 --> 38:22.395
But I have never addressed

38:22.419 --> 38:25.487
why I am such a knee-jerk contrarian.

38:27.057 --> 38:29.635
As the president's counselor, my job

38:29.659 --> 38:31.971
is to push back on everything.

38:31.995 --> 38:34.073
Kick the tires.

38:34.097 --> 38:36.075
Having to make decisions

38:36.099 --> 38:39.935
and shoulder uncertain consequences...

38:40.937 --> 38:43.249
...that's the real crucible.

38:43.273 --> 38:46.752
What are you trying to say, Russell?

38:46.776 --> 38:50.256
That you're ready, Bess.

39:06.830 --> 39:08.808
This is my favorite part.

39:13.737 --> 39:15.314
Right here.

39:15.338 --> 39:16.782
Whoo!

39:18.074 --> 39:20.186
- DJ TurnItUpYo!
- Wow.

39:20.210 --> 39:21.821
- Whoo!
- Huh, that was something.

39:21.845 --> 39:23.723
Who is she?

39:23.747 --> 39:25.291
Mix tapes, Ali. I forgot 'em.

39:25.315 --> 39:27.927
Oh, um, we can burn 'em
some on my desktop.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.897
DJ TurnItUpYo is also
available for bar mitzvahs,

39:30.921 --> 39:33.065
- weddings...
- Proms, parties, anything.

39:33.089 --> 39:34.901
Well, we'll-we'll spread the word.

39:34.925 --> 39:37.003
Good beat, and there...

39:37.027 --> 39:39.472
Thank you so much
for sitting through that.

39:39.496 --> 39:41.073
I liked it, whatever it was.

39:41.097 --> 39:44.010
The least I could do
for a wonderful dinner.

39:44.034 --> 39:45.645
Those pierogies.

39:45.669 --> 39:48.047
Glad they passed muster.

39:48.071 --> 39:50.316
Yeah, th were divine.

39:50.340 --> 39:52.118
Just like these pierogies

39:52.142 --> 39:54.654
I used to get on 8th at Ludomir's.

39:54.678 --> 39:56.589
I tried, but the dough,

39:56.613 --> 39:59.740
- it kept coming out like cartilage.
- No, don't be so harsh.

39:59.741 --> 40:01.741
- It was more like chewing gum.
- Ah, it's the thought

40:01.742 --> 40:04.163
- that counts.
- So, what's next for you, Lena?

40:04.187 --> 40:05.531
Healing up.

40:05.555 --> 40:07.533
Then back to teaching.

40:07.557 --> 40:09.969
Good. Because 38 million students

40:09.993 --> 40:11.737
- need you.
- Aw, come on,

40:11.761 --> 40:13.873
Elizabeth, be serious. I couldn't be

40:13.897 --> 40:16.348
- more serious.
- Henry, how much Bordeaux

40:16.349 --> 40:18.260
did she have?

40:18.284 --> 40:20.396
In vino veritas.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.465
- I think it's a great idea.
- Lena,

40:22.489 --> 40:24.834
you're a natural-born leader.

40:24.858 --> 40:27.092
Poland needs you.

40:35.201 --> 40:37.613
Oh, you jerk.

40:39.239 --> 40:41.217
- Oh...
- Did Lena get off okay?

40:41.241 --> 40:44.453
Yeah. The car just picked her up.

40:44.477 --> 40:46.022
After we had...

40:46.046 --> 40:49.859
polished off a few
snifters of slivovitz.

40:49.883 --> 40:51.494
Ugh. Ugh.

40:51.518 --> 40:53.229
Better you than me.

40:53.253 --> 40:56.232
All those state dinners.

40:56.256 --> 40:59.535
At this point, my liver could
probably metabolize gasoline.

40:59.559 --> 41:00.993
Hmm.

41:03.430 --> 41:05.307
Lena's something, huh?

41:05.331 --> 41:06.575
Mm-hmm.

41:06.599 --> 41:08.978
She's gonna make a great president.

41:09.002 --> 41:10.980
If she runs.

41:11.004 --> 41:12.782
Hope I was convincing.

41:12.806 --> 41:14.550
Very.

41:14.574 --> 41:16.200
But I couldn't help
thinking that maybe

41:16.224 --> 41:17.867
you were trying to convince yourself.

41:18.845 --> 41:21.290
Geez! Russell, now you.

41:21.314 --> 41:23.125
I already said I was gonna do it.

41:23.149 --> 41:25.261
Yeah, you've been saying
that for a while now.

41:25.285 --> 41:26.962
Kicking the can down the road

41:26.986 --> 41:28.164
week after week.

41:28.188 --> 41:29.999
Callister's already got
an exploratory committee

41:30.023 --> 41:31.701
up and running, he's got...

41:31.725 --> 41:33.903
pollsters in play.
Well, I'd have to resign

41:33.927 --> 41:36.261
before I can declare.

41:37.664 --> 41:39.698
You think it's time?

41:42.135 --> 41:43.535
Yeah.

41:46.339 --> 41:48.440
I'm going back to sleep.

42:32.429 --> 42:38.529
