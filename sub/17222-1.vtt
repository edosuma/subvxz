01:14.521 --> 01:16.352
<i>My name is Emanuel.</i>

01:16.554 --> 01:19.653
<i>I'm seventeen years old
and I killed my mother.</i>

01:21.054 --> 01:23.353
<i>I had her sliced open,</i>

01:23.355 --> 01:26.120
<i>like a goat for the slaughter,
to get me pulled out.</i>

01:27.487 --> 01:31.086
<i>As she bled, the doctor
pushed air into my lungs,</i>

01:31.088 --> 01:34.220
<i>and pressed his hands
repeatedly onto my chest,</i>

01:34.222 --> 01:37.120
<i>with the same rhythmic,
repetitive motion</i>

01:37.122 --> 01:40.053
<i>that he used to jerk himself
off that very morning.</i>

01:42.620 --> 01:43.686
<i>It worked.</i>

01:45.288 --> 01:47.353
<i>He came and I came...
Back to life.</i>

01:53.187 --> 01:56.220
<i>The fact that my mother
lost her life for this,</i>

01:56.222 --> 01:58.986
<i>for me, is probably
just a side note.</i>

01:58.988 --> 02:01.086
<i>The cost of doing business.</i>

02:06.154 --> 02:08.220
<i>But it's me who pays.</i>

02:08.487 --> 02:11.320
<i>It's on my tab.</i>

02:11.322 --> 02:14.419
<i>And it accumulates interest
with every passing year.</i>

02:37.487 --> 02:41.186
<i>My point is,
there's no place for me.</i>

02:41.188 --> 02:45.020
<i>Because I'm not
supposed to be here.</i>

02:45.022 --> 02:49.920
<i>Maybe if I was some sort of Olympic
athlete, or a genius scientist,</i>

02:49.922 --> 02:52.053
<i>but I'm not.</i>

02:52.055 --> 02:54.686
<i>I'm not any of those things.</i>

02:54.688 --> 02:59.586
<i>I'm just a girl.
A murderer without a motive.</i>

02:59.588 --> 03:05.319
<i>So I serve my time, waiting
for my sentence to be up.</i>

03:05.321 --> 03:08.186
Mmm.
This is delicious.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.586
It's made with aged gouda
instead of cheddar.

03:10.588 --> 03:13.086
That's what gives it
its sharp kick.

03:13.088 --> 03:14.419
What do you think, honey?

03:14.421 --> 03:16.552
Sophisticated is the word
that comes to mind.

03:16.554 --> 03:19.386
Sophisticated, I like that.

03:19.388 --> 03:21.519
How was your day, pumpkin?

03:21.521 --> 03:24.486
Great. I met a boy, and we're dating.
It's pretty serious.

03:24.488 --> 03:26.920
Oh, that's wonderful!
What's his name?

03:26.922 --> 03:29.053
Claude.
Claude.

03:29.055 --> 03:30.953
You've just met and it's serious?

03:30.955 --> 03:33.053
Yeah, it is.
Can you pass the broccoli?

03:33.055 --> 03:35.953
Well, I think that's lovely.

03:35.955 --> 03:38.653
I think it's about time that Emanuel
had a nice fellow in her life.

03:38.655 --> 03:41.586
Why? Were you starting to
think that I was a lesbian?

03:43.320 --> 03:45.253
No.

03:45.255 --> 03:47.586
God, no.
Why would you say that?

03:47.588 --> 03:49.319
I had a dream about you last week.
Sexual.

03:49.321 --> 03:50.653
Emanuel.

03:50.655 --> 03:53.452
Thought maybe you picked up on it.

03:53.454 --> 03:55.419
No. No, I didn't.

03:55.421 --> 03:57.286
Hmm. It's perfectly normal.

03:57.288 --> 03:59.253
Just some hybrid oedipal,
Electra complex,

03:59.255 --> 04:02.186
nicely tailored for the happy,
modern stepfamily.

04:07.287 --> 04:08.646
Relax. It doesn't mean I
actually want to have...

04:08.672 --> 04:10.453
<i>Emanuel.</i>
No offense, but you're not my type.

04:10.455 --> 04:13.220
<i>Emanuel, that's enough.</i>

04:21.053 --> 04:22.986
Ignore her.

04:24.621 --> 04:27.386
She always gets this way
around her birthday.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.552
Hey!

05:55.554 --> 05:57.053
Emanuel, be more careful, please.

05:57.055 --> 05:58.653
No. I can't.

05:58.655 --> 06:00.486
This isn't your private
jerk off closet.

06:00.488 --> 06:02.086
I know.
It's a rickety ladder

06:02.088 --> 06:04.920
on which I'm moving some
sophisticated equipment.

06:04.922 --> 06:08.452
Hardly consider a penis pump
sophisticated equipment.

06:08.454 --> 06:10.986
Why don't you just try one
and get it over with?

06:10.988 --> 06:13.053
Why is it sticky?

06:13.055 --> 06:15.686
Look. If I had a penis, I'd try it.

06:15.688 --> 06:18.352
It's like if you worked at a restaurant
and they added a new dish to the menu.

06:18.354 --> 06:21.053
You need to try it to know
what you're selling.

06:21.055 --> 06:22.152
Don't want to try the dish.

06:22.154 --> 06:24.086
Hmm.

06:30.654 --> 06:32.419
Tickets.

06:40.654 --> 06:42.219
I'm Claude.

06:42.221 --> 06:44.486
I know.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.252
Says on your bag.

06:48.186 --> 06:50.319
Oh. Uh, this isn't my bag.

06:50.321 --> 06:53.653
Well, I mean, it is,
it's from when I was a kid.

06:53.655 --> 06:56.986
My bag got stolen, so I just pulled
this out from the depths of my closet.

06:56.988 --> 06:58.552
Tickets.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.686
What's that on your arm?

07:03.688 --> 07:06.085
My name.

07:06.087 --> 07:08.953
Emanuel.
Isn't that a boy's spelling?

07:08.955 --> 07:11.352
They thought I was
going to be a boy.

07:11.354 --> 07:13.185
But you're not.

07:13.187 --> 07:17.419
Reality is overrated.

07:17.421 --> 07:20.152
So why do you have your
name tattooed on your arm?

07:20.154 --> 07:23.419
Because if I get separated from
my bag, I'll still know who I am.

07:23.421 --> 07:25.152
<i>Next stop, Benovale.</i>

07:25.154 --> 07:26.920
Bye.

07:49.354 --> 07:51.552
<i>She seems nice.
You know, reserved.</i>

07:51.554 --> 07:53.486
Where's she from?
Denver.

07:53.488 --> 07:55.486
She got a husband?

07:55.488 --> 07:59.386
I didn't ask, but it certainly
didn't seem like it.

07:59.388 --> 08:02.586
It's just a shame, having to raise a
young baby like that all on your own.

08:02.588 --> 08:05.619
Dad did it.
Look how well I turned out.

08:05.621 --> 08:08.185
You might want to go over there
and give her some pointers.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.519
She did mention that she was
looking for a babysitter,

08:10.521 --> 08:14.019
but I can't think of anyone
off the top of my head.

08:14.021 --> 08:15.252
The Denzel twins have
moved away, right?

08:15.254 --> 08:18.419
I'll do it.

08:18.421 --> 08:20.452
You will?

08:20.454 --> 08:22.019
Yeah, sure.

08:22.021 --> 08:24.019
But you hate kids.
I need the money.

08:24.021 --> 08:25.953
What for?

08:25.955 --> 08:28.386
Decided I'm going to become a collector
of Precious Moments figurines.

08:28.388 --> 08:30.019
Oh.
She's messing with you.

08:30.021 --> 08:32.519
No, I'm not.
I must have them.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.119
As a constant reminder
of the preciousness of life.

08:36.121 --> 08:38.152
When do I start?

08:38.154 --> 08:40.219
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.452
Would you mind?
I need to talk to him.

08:51.621 --> 08:53.686
Excuse me.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.519
What did you say to him?

09:00.521 --> 09:02.319
I told him that you'd
gotten me pregnant.

09:02.321 --> 09:04.052
So I decided to get an abortion,

09:04.054 --> 09:05.653
but wanted to tell
you on the train,

09:05.655 --> 09:08.085
surrounded by people,
in case you became violent.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.352
Wow.

09:10.354 --> 09:12.952
Well that's certainly
one way to liberate a seat.

09:25.587 --> 09:27.185
Hi.

09:27.187 --> 09:31.019
Hi.
I'm Emanuel.

09:31.021 --> 09:35.286
Come in.

09:35.288 --> 09:37.920
Something to drink?

09:37.922 --> 09:39.586
Just some water.
Thanks.

09:39.588 --> 09:41.519
Okay.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.586
How old are you?

09:57.588 --> 09:59.486
Turning eighteen this month.

09:59.488 --> 10:01.319
Oh, yeah.
That's a fun age.

10:01.321 --> 10:03.586
I guess.

10:03.588 --> 10:05.386
College plans?

10:05.388 --> 10:09.185
No. I didn't really
like school very much.

10:09.187 --> 10:12.252
Can't imagine why anyone would
voluntarily sign up for more of it.

10:14.953 --> 10:17.286
But I like learning stuff.

10:17.288 --> 10:19.352
I'm teaching myself
to speak French.

10:19.354 --> 10:22.185
Oh. So you're planning
on doing some traveling.

10:22.187 --> 10:24.386
No.

10:24.388 --> 10:27.452
Well, it would be a pity to speak
French and not go to France.

10:31.186 --> 10:32.919
Well, I've got some
errands to run, so...

10:32.921 --> 10:36.052
I'll see you in about
an hour and a half.

10:36.054 --> 10:38.619
Oh, please put your
glass in the sink.

10:45.053 --> 10:49.352
Uh, and what about the baby?

10:49.354 --> 10:50.686
Well, that's why you're here.

10:50.688 --> 10:52.586
Well, I know, I mean,

10:52.588 --> 10:54.486
shouldn't we meet before
you leave us together?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.519
Oh, no, Chloe is asleep,

10:56.521 --> 10:58.352
and if I wake her up she's
going to be very crabby.

10:58.354 --> 11:00.952
Oh.
Just make yourself at home.

11:00.954 --> 11:02.386
There's a stereo in there.

11:02.388 --> 11:04.352
What happens if the baby wakes up?

11:04.354 --> 11:06.952
Baby monitors.
So...

11:06.954 --> 11:08.985
You'll know if she needs you.

11:08.987 --> 11:10.185
Okay.

11:10.187 --> 11:12.119
Okay.

13:14.254 --> 13:18.686
How do you like living here?

13:18.688 --> 13:21.319
It's fine, I guess.

13:21.321 --> 13:23.952
I don't really know anywhere else.

13:23.954 --> 13:25.653
There's not much going on.

13:25.655 --> 13:28.085
Hi, guys!

13:28.087 --> 13:30.919
I figured you could use a little
refreshment, in the heat.

13:30.921 --> 13:32.286
There you go.
Very thoughtful of you.

13:32.288 --> 13:34.653
Oh, it was nothing.
Thank you.

13:34.655 --> 13:37.352
Oh, it's looking good.

13:37.354 --> 13:39.653
It's a start.

13:39.655 --> 13:41.586
Mmm.

13:45.353 --> 13:48.119
Well, I don't want to keep
you from your work. So...

13:48.121 --> 13:50.352
Oh, here.

13:50.354 --> 13:52.185
Oh!

13:52.187 --> 13:54.586
No, no, I couldn't.
Oh, please?

13:54.588 --> 13:56.219
If I put these all in my house
it's going to look like a wake.

13:56.221 --> 13:59.019
Oh, thank you, they're beautiful.

13:59.021 --> 14:01.085
Okay.
I'll see you in a bit.

14:09.253 --> 14:11.652
So why don't you like your stepmom?

14:11.654 --> 14:14.119
She's fine.

14:14.121 --> 14:17.019
It's just been me and
my dad for so long,

14:17.021 --> 14:19.085
still getting used to
having someone else there.

14:19.087 --> 14:21.152
Where's your mom?

14:22.186 --> 14:24.252
Dead.

14:25.053 --> 14:28.552
Oh. That's awful.

14:43.354 --> 14:45.519
Could you, um...

14:45.521 --> 14:48.286
Could you pick up these tools and this
tarp and put it back in the shed for me?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.985
Yeah, sure.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.652
False alarm.

15:00.654 --> 15:04.985
She was just stretching, and
making herself feel comfortable.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.919
Uh, I'd love to be able to
take power naps like that.

15:07.921 --> 15:09.552
I have something for you.

15:15.954 --> 15:17.419
<i>Pour toi.</i>

15:17.421 --> 15:19.319
I actually lived
in France for a stint.

15:19.321 --> 15:21.352
Thank you.

15:21.354 --> 15:26.319
Oh, positive. I don't even know
how they got in the moving boxes.

15:28.586 --> 15:30.919
There's a basket of, uh, Chloe's
things in the laundry room.

15:30.921 --> 15:32.452
Could you take them upstairs
to the hall closet for me?

15:32.454 --> 15:34.519
Yeah, sure.

16:02.654 --> 16:05.652
What are you doing?

16:05.654 --> 16:08.952
I thought I heard something,
but now I don't.

16:11.020 --> 16:14.185
Huh.

16:14.187 --> 16:16.252
I don't hear a thing.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.319
I'll do this load again.
It's fine.

16:20.321 --> 16:22.319
Just come down.

16:22.321 --> 16:24.386
I don't want to mess
with her sleeping schedule.

16:52.288 --> 16:54.219
Hey,
what are you doing out here?

16:54.221 --> 16:57.985
Studying.

16:57.987 --> 16:59.985
Studying?

16:59.987 --> 17:02.652
French.
Really.

17:02.654 --> 17:05.319
You must be pretty good by now.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.452
You know, you get that
from your mom.

17:07.454 --> 17:11.219
She soaked up languages
like a sponge.

17:11.221 --> 17:15.952
She dragged me to so many
French films, I can't remember.

17:15.954 --> 17:19.115
Do you ever think about what it would have
been like if I'd died instead of Mom?

17:20.618 --> 17:23.185
No.

17:23.186 --> 17:26.919
Really?
I do.

17:29.921 --> 17:33.518
You know, Em, I've been thinking.

17:33.520 --> 17:38.551
Maybe this is the year that you come
with me to visit your mother's grave.

17:39.553 --> 17:42.952
You know, it doesn't have to be on
the actual day of your birthday.

17:42.954 --> 17:45.052
And why would I do that?

17:45.054 --> 17:50.618
I think it's important on the anniversary
of someone's death to pay your respects.

17:50.620 --> 17:55.685
If you want the company,
take Janice.

17:55.687 --> 17:59.052
It's not about company, honey.

17:59.054 --> 18:01.618
It's about you.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.185
Hi.

18:36.187 --> 18:37.985
Wasn't expecting to see
you until this afternoon.

18:37.987 --> 18:40.019
It's the weekend.

18:40.021 --> 18:42.219
You said you wanted help
organizing your office.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.618
Right.

18:45.620 --> 18:48.685
Well, uh, just go ahead. I'll meet
you in there. Chloe's asleep.

19:07.220 --> 19:11.319
Oh.
Where to start?

19:13.321 --> 19:16.919
Uh-huh.
This was her favorite.

19:16.921 --> 19:19.985
But we dropped it so many times
it has now been officially retired.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.685
Linda?

19:34.687 --> 19:37.385
I'm sorry. I just...

19:37.387 --> 19:39.152
I just realized how tired I am.

19:42.087 --> 19:45.351
You know, I think I am going to
take a little nap in the study.

19:45.353 --> 19:46.952
Would you take this
box to my bedroom?

19:46.954 --> 19:49.019
Yes.

21:25.287 --> 21:27.351
I heard her on the monitor too.

21:27.353 --> 21:30.085
Yes, it's okay.

21:30.087 --> 21:31.919
Oh. I know.

21:31.921 --> 21:34.052
You don't like it when you
do a pee-pee in your diaper.

21:34.054 --> 21:36.551
No, you don't.

21:36.553 --> 21:40.919
No, you don't.

21:40.921 --> 21:44.385
It's really the only time
she gets fussy. Can...

21:44.387 --> 21:48.218
I can feed her off schedule, then put
her down to sleep off schedule, but...

21:48.220 --> 21:51.052
She doesn't get her diaper
changed when it's wet,

21:51.054 --> 21:55.285
well, it's pretty much all over.

21:55.287 --> 21:58.218
Oh, can you do me a favor and
get the onesie with the monkeys?

21:58.220 --> 22:02.318
For my little monkey.
Yes, for you.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.618
It's in the dresser in the hall.

22:05.620 --> 22:08.218
Will you get it for me?

22:09.185 --> 22:10.985
<i>Yes, that's better.</i>

22:10.987 --> 22:14.251
<i>That's much better.</i>

22:14.253 --> 22:17.019
<i>Yes. That's better.
That's much better.</i>

22:26.153 --> 22:28.618
Getting cold in here!

22:28.620 --> 22:31.385
Yes we are.
Yes we are.

22:45.152 --> 22:49.485
Gonna get those feet!

22:51.287 --> 22:53.952
I got your toes.
I got your toes.

22:53.954 --> 22:55.652
Yes I do.

22:55.654 --> 22:59.551
Oh, that's the one we like.

22:59.553 --> 23:02.518
Because it is soft and silly.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.685
<i>Just like you.</i>

23:04.687 --> 23:06.499
<i>Want to come over
here and finish?</i>

23:06.525 --> 23:07.152
No.

23:07.954 --> 23:12.152
Well, come on. Come a little closer
and you can see how it's done.

23:13.054 --> 23:16.518
Now, you always have to remember
to support her head a little bit.

23:16.520 --> 23:21.952
You start with the cute
little feet first.

23:21.954 --> 23:24.151
I want to eat those feet
they're so cute.

23:24.153 --> 23:27.952
And then your cute little butt.

23:27.954 --> 23:29.518
Look at that little butt.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.585
Oh, you wiggle worm.

23:31.587 --> 23:35.251
And then we snap you up.

23:35.253 --> 23:39.685
Ooh, and we eat you up.

23:39.687 --> 23:41.285
Yes, we do.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.084
Here, you hold her.

23:46.086 --> 23:47.919
Oh, come on.
She's not gonna bite.

23:47.921 --> 23:51.218
She doesn't even have
her little teeth yet.

23:51.220 --> 23:53.285
There you go.

24:48.353 --> 24:51.184
Herb roasted chicken with
porcini mushroom stuffing.

24:51.186 --> 24:53.118
Mmm.

24:54.252 --> 24:56.184
Well?

24:57.486 --> 24:59.518
Well what?

24:59.520 --> 25:04.518
Well, how's it going with,
uh, what, Linda's her name?

25:04.520 --> 25:07.051
It's fine.

25:07.053 --> 25:08.585
Just fine, not good?

25:08.587 --> 25:10.184
Oh, no, no,
this looks delicious.

25:10.186 --> 25:12.585
We're, we're talking
about the babysitting.

25:12.587 --> 25:16.118
Oh.
Yes, how's that going?

25:16.120 --> 25:19.184
Fine.

25:19.186 --> 25:22.551
How is it that a child who
had more words at two

25:22.553 --> 25:26.685
than an average first grader suddenly
becomes monosyllabic at eighteen?

25:26.687 --> 25:29.151
Maybe I have late onset autism.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.418
Maybe you've taken on too much.

25:31.420 --> 25:33.919
You look tired.

25:33.921 --> 25:35.485
You know what,
with the job in town,

25:35.487 --> 25:38.051
and now this babysitting...

25:38.053 --> 25:40.285
You know, you really sound
like a woman sometimes.

25:40.287 --> 25:43.051
No offense, Janice.

25:45.319 --> 25:50.385
I am just dying
to meet that baby.

25:50.387 --> 25:52.451
Yeah.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.618
Hi.

26:04.620 --> 26:08.218
I'm her parole officer and I
need you to leave your seat.

26:13.119 --> 26:17.051
Hey.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.919
Don't you want to know
what I told her?

26:19.920 --> 26:22.318
No.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.385
Are you okay?

26:30.985 --> 26:33.351
Hey. Listen.

26:33.353 --> 26:35.351
Did I do something to
offend you or something?

26:35.353 --> 26:36.485
I mean,
you seem pretty mad at me,

26:36.487 --> 26:37.685
and I have no idea what I've done.

26:37.687 --> 26:39.518
Oh, really?
You have no idea?

26:39.520 --> 26:41.318
No.
Where were you this morning?

26:41.320 --> 26:43.585
I was on the 6 a.m. train.
I looked for you in all 32 cars.

26:43.587 --> 26:46.118
I missed the 6 a.m. because...
Oh, forget it.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.551
Well, why were you on the 6 a.m.?

26:48.553 --> 26:50.451
Because I wanted to see you.

26:50.453 --> 26:54.151
I'm here now.
It doesn't work like that.

26:54.153 --> 26:56.451
If you're going to be my boyfriend,
I can't have you disappearing on me.

26:56.453 --> 26:58.984
I don't take well to
people disappearing on me.

26:58.986 --> 27:01.351
Boyfriend?
Oh, please.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.485
You're gonna pretend like you
haven't been thinking about

27:03.487 --> 27:06.118
what it'd be like to hold my hand?
To kiss me?

27:06.120 --> 27:07.685
Well, maybe. I...

27:07.687 --> 27:09.951
Which is it?
Maybe, or yes?

27:09.953 --> 27:11.518
Yes.

27:23.552 --> 27:25.618
I'll see you on the train tomorrow.

28:03.519 --> 28:05.685
Hello?

28:05.687 --> 28:07.685
Linda?

28:07.687 --> 28:09.618
I'm in the kitchen.

28:23.052 --> 28:27.951
She loves waking up to a bath.

28:27.953 --> 28:30.118
Here, you rinse her.
It's her favorite part.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.018
I'm okay.

28:32.020 --> 28:35.984
I want you to get to know her.
I want her to trust you.

28:35.986 --> 28:37.918
Come on.

28:40.052 --> 28:44.184
Put your hand behind
her head like this.

28:44.186 --> 28:46.618
Come on.
There you go.

28:46.620 --> 28:48.685
That's all there is to it.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.051
I think she's pretty well rinsed.

29:08.053 --> 29:10.184
Well then dry her off.

29:10.186 --> 29:12.618
I'm gonna take her
on a sunset walk.

29:12.620 --> 29:15.652
You are?
Yeah.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.518
It'd be good for some fresh air.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.285
We did garden this morning,
but I think it's about time

29:19.287 --> 29:21.518
that she get to know
her neighborhood.

29:21.520 --> 29:25.118
There's a flu that's been going around.
It's really bad.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.351
I don't think you should go introduce
her to new neighbors just yet.

29:27.353 --> 29:29.551
Don't you hear her crying?

29:29.553 --> 29:31.652
Yeah.

29:31.654 --> 29:33.485
I just didn't know what to do.

29:33.487 --> 29:37.285
You rock her back and forth.

29:37.287 --> 29:39.218
And you talk to her,
because she likes that.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.984
She likes to be talked to.

29:40.986 --> 29:44.485
Don't you, Chloe?
Yeah.

29:44.487 --> 29:47.285
Because you're such a good listener.
Yes, you are.

29:47.287 --> 29:50.885
Yeah.
There we go.

29:53.387 --> 29:55.551
Don't worry.

29:55.553 --> 29:59.184
You'll figure it out.

29:59.186 --> 30:03.885
I was so worried when
I brought her home.

30:04.487 --> 30:06.652
Was I gonna be able
to take care of her?

30:08.520 --> 30:11.652
What if I was a terrible mother?

30:11.654 --> 30:14.051
What if I didn't like it?

30:14.053 --> 30:17.084
But then...

30:17.086 --> 30:19.084
It just happens.
It just comes to you as you go along,

30:19.086 --> 30:22.051
and it's like you were
meant to do it.

30:22.053 --> 30:26.285
Like you've been doing it
your whole life.

30:26.287 --> 30:30.518
And then you think
about your life before her.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.652
It was so pointless,

30:33.654 --> 30:37.551
so selfish, and you just can't
imagine your life without her.

30:37.553 --> 30:40.351
No, I can't.

30:40.353 --> 30:42.285
No.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.918
I've decided to go
for a run instead.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.285
Try to lose these last five pounds.

30:58.287 --> 31:00.018
You can never turn
your back on her...

31:00.020 --> 31:01.651
when you have her up
here like this.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.684
I mean,
she's a feisty little one.

31:03.686 --> 31:06.984
We wouldn't want her
ending up on the floor.

31:06.986 --> 31:10.051
Of course not.
Sorry.

31:10.053 --> 31:12.518
It's okay.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.585
I'll be back soon.

31:23.587 --> 31:27.518
Guess we better get you dressed.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.218
Don't take this personally,
but...

31:30.220 --> 31:32.518
I'm not very talkative
to begin with.

31:32.520 --> 31:36.385
So, if we don't really chat a lot,

31:36.387 --> 31:39.451
it's not that I don't like you.

31:39.453 --> 31:44.218
It's more that I like
to keep to myself.

31:44.220 --> 31:46.984
I just wanted to make that clear.
Okay?

32:06.686 --> 32:08.118
Hi.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.084
What are you doing here?

32:09.086 --> 32:10.351
I brought cookies.

32:10.353 --> 32:11.918
Linda doesn't want cookies.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.485
Who doesn't want cookies?

32:13.487 --> 32:17.451
That is ridiculous.
She's bone thin.

32:17.453 --> 32:19.418
Oh, you're not gonna let me in?

32:19.420 --> 32:21.451
Linda's not here.
She's gone running.

32:21.453 --> 32:24.051
Oh. Well...

32:24.053 --> 32:26.318
I'd love to see the baby.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.218
You can't.
She's sleeping.

32:28.220 --> 32:32.617
Well, I'll just take a quick
peek at her, in the crib.

32:32.619 --> 32:37.051
Oh, this is...

32:37.053 --> 32:40.651
You know, it's much nicer
than I suspected. She...

32:40.653 --> 32:43.084
God, she really did
the place up quickly.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.984
I mean, what did she do, take
measurements months ago,

32:45.986 --> 32:48.518
and then just arrive with
all the perfect pieces?

32:48.520 --> 32:50.451
How should I know?

32:50.453 --> 32:53.550
Oh.
No, don't.

32:53.552 --> 32:56.151
Linda's very specific
about disinfecting hands

32:56.153 --> 32:58.351
before touching any
of Chloe's toys.

32:58.353 --> 32:59.584
Well, I'm sure my hands are nowhere
near as dirty as the floor.

32:59.586 --> 33:02.385
No. No.

33:02.387 --> 33:08.218
She's super particular.
Like verging on neurotic.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.550
Where's the kitchen?

33:09.552 --> 33:11.617
That way.

33:17.585 --> 33:20.617
Oh, I like that.

33:20.619 --> 33:22.550
Nice.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.918
So, you're enjoying
working for Linda?

33:27.920 --> 33:29.184
Yeah, it's fine.

33:29.186 --> 33:31.051
Oh.
What's she like?

33:31.053 --> 33:32.318
She's nice.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.651
And...

33:33.653 --> 33:35.285
And that's it.
Oh.

33:35.287 --> 33:36.651
Just, you've been spending
a lot of time together.

33:36.653 --> 33:40.484
I just figured you'd know
her a little better by now.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.251
I don't, really.

33:42.253 --> 33:46.118
But you like her?

33:46.120 --> 33:48.318
I mean, when I saw you two
gardening together,

33:48.320 --> 33:49.651
you seemed to be
having a lot of fun.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.151
You know, talking, and...

33:51.153 --> 33:53.351
Yeah.

33:54.653 --> 33:57.184
Hello.
Hello.

33:57.186 --> 33:59.018
Oh, you look like you've
had quite a run.

33:59.020 --> 34:02.251
No.
Ridiculously short, actually.

34:02.253 --> 34:05.084
I brought you some
fresh baked cookies.

34:05.086 --> 34:08.118
That's very sweet of you.
Thank you.

34:08.120 --> 34:11.449
Where's Chloe?
Sleeping.

34:11.452 --> 34:14.118
Sleeping?
Yeah.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.484
She fell asleep in my arms,
so I put her down for a nap.

34:16.485 --> 34:17.550
Huh.

34:17.552 --> 34:23.018
You know, we would love to have you and
little Chloe over for dinner some night.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.318
Oh, wow.
That would be lovely.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.251
Um, but Chloe goes
to bed quite early.

34:28.253 --> 34:30.150
Well, maybe Emanuel could
stay later one night.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.484
You know,
earn a little extra money.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.484
I don't need extra money.

34:33.485 --> 34:35.984
And I use my nights
to study French.

34:35.985 --> 34:37.449
Well, maybe you could
study your French here.

34:37.452 --> 34:42.184
You know, while the
baby is sleeping?

34:42.186 --> 34:44.583
Yeah. Okay.

34:44.585 --> 34:47.051
Great. It's settled.
How about Friday?

34:47.053 --> 34:50.083
Okay.

34:50.085 --> 34:52.251
Yeah.
Okay.

34:52.253 --> 34:55.318
Okay.
You girls have a great night.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.984
How many calories do you
think each one of these has?

35:22.986 --> 35:25.285
I don't know.
Lots.

35:25.287 --> 35:27.417
I should really wake Chloe up, otherwise
she's gonna stay up all night.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.584
I'll do it.

35:29.586 --> 35:33.151
You know, so she gets used to me.
Trusts me.

35:33.153 --> 35:35.218
Okay. It's a good idea.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.651
What happened?

36:06.653 --> 36:08.984
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

36:08.986 --> 36:10.285
Are you okay?

36:10.287 --> 36:12.084
I was gonna take her
out for some air,

36:12.086 --> 36:13.384
and bumped into the thing,
and I...

36:13.386 --> 36:15.184
Oh, my God.

36:15.186 --> 36:16.285
I'm fine. It's just a little cut.
Oh, that's deep.

36:16.287 --> 36:17.984
No. I'm fine.

36:17.986 --> 36:21.084
Come on. Come on, it's okay.
Come on.

36:23.985 --> 36:26.051
Okay.
This is gonna sting.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.984
Just for a second.

36:37.953 --> 36:39.184
Better?

36:39.186 --> 36:40.518
Yeah.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.184
Look at you two.
You look like sisters.

36:47.186 --> 36:50.484
Yeah.

36:50.486 --> 36:53.550
I hope Chloe grows up to be as
pretty and interesting as you.

36:56.285 --> 36:58.317
You've got so much going
on behind those blue eyes.

36:58.319 --> 37:04.218
I noticed it the moment I met you.

37:04.220 --> 37:07.550
I see myself in you.

37:07.552 --> 37:09.617
Not necessarily a good thing.

37:19.020 --> 37:21.984
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm solving world hunger.

37:21.986 --> 37:23.918
Uh-oh.
Very funny.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.984
It's dangerous, that
sort of work, okay?

37:25.986 --> 37:27.484
It's not really fit for a woman.

37:27.486 --> 37:29.984
So why don't you get down and
let me finish up, please?

37:29.986 --> 37:32.617
I got it. I don't want to take advantage
of your manly stacking skills.

37:32.619 --> 37:34.417
Um...
Go help up front.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.918
I hate customer interaction.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.417
And Sam won't let me wear
the surgical masks anymore.

37:38.419 --> 37:40.250
He says it sends the wrong message.

37:40.252 --> 37:42.918
Oh. I disagree.
They give you an air of competence.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.918
Just...

37:45.920 --> 37:48.051
Emanuel, get down.
Let me do my job.

37:48.053 --> 37:49.517
How do you expect to meet
any women back here?

37:49.519 --> 37:52.317
Uh...

37:52.319 --> 37:54.684
What I'm saying is, you're looking
very handsome these days,

37:54.686 --> 37:58.450
and it's wasted on me.

37:58.452 --> 38:00.284
Why are you being so nice?

38:00.286 --> 38:01.918
And happy?

38:01.920 --> 38:04.484
Guess I'm just a nice,
happy person.

38:14.985 --> 38:18.584
Doctor said I have lice.

38:23.186 --> 38:26.918
Uh, any chance...

38:26.920 --> 38:31.384
You know, take it on to stationary
land, just for a change?

38:31.386 --> 38:34.584
Okay. Sure.

38:34.586 --> 38:36.317
Well, how about Friday night?

38:36.319 --> 38:39.484
I can't this Friday.
I have to babysit late.

38:39.486 --> 38:42.350
Okay, well...
Actually...

38:42.352 --> 38:44.584
This Friday night would be perfect.

38:44.586 --> 38:46.617
Can you pick me up at 7:00?

38:46.619 --> 38:48.284
Yeah.

38:48.286 --> 38:50.284
Great.

39:26.919 --> 39:31.517
We're up here. Shh.

39:32.519 --> 39:34.984
Okay.

39:34.986 --> 39:36.684
Oh, thank God you're here.

39:36.686 --> 39:40.051
She's just making me crazy today.
How come?

39:40.053 --> 39:42.584
I don't know. Usually, I can
just sit her in her bouncy chair

39:42.586 --> 39:45.284
and she will entertain herself.
But no, not today.

39:45.286 --> 39:49.584
She wants my undivided
attention at all times.

39:52.086 --> 39:53.484
Here.

39:53.486 --> 39:56.550
This is her new best friend.

39:56.552 --> 40:00.517
This is terrible, but sometimes
I just don't want to be a mother.

40:00.519 --> 40:04.051
I just want to push a button
and put Chloe on pause

40:04.053 --> 40:07.550
and just get on with my day.

40:07.552 --> 40:10.184
That sounds awful, doesn't it?

40:10.219 --> 40:13.951
No. Sounds honest.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.384
Do you want me to give her a bath?

40:15.386 --> 40:17.417
No, we've already done that.

40:17.419 --> 40:19.951
You know, actually, the one thing
that would be really helpful

40:19.953 --> 40:23.350
is if you could just honestly tell me
which of these sweaters I need to toss.

40:23.352 --> 40:26.117
Okay, but I'm not
so good with fashion.

40:26.119 --> 40:30.317
Come on, sit down.

40:30.319 --> 40:32.984
I love your style. I mean,
I think it's too young for me,

40:32.986 --> 40:35.550
but I think you
have excellent taste.

40:40.618 --> 40:43.217
Okay.

40:43.219 --> 40:45.484
So what should I wear to
your house on Friday?

40:45.486 --> 40:47.217
Actually,
I can't babysit Friday night.

40:47.219 --> 40:49.450
Something came up.

40:49.452 --> 40:52.183
That's okay.

40:52.185 --> 40:55.918
What are you doing?

40:55.920 --> 40:58.350
I sort of have a date.

40:58.352 --> 41:00.651
That's exciting!
Who is it?

41:00.653 --> 41:03.217
Just some boy I met on the train.

41:03.219 --> 41:05.651
Does he have a name?

41:05.653 --> 41:07.918
Claude.

41:14.051 --> 41:16.284
You should wear this.

41:16.286 --> 41:18.050
Here, try it on.

41:18.052 --> 41:21.117
It's really pretty, but...
Oh, just try it on.

41:23.919 --> 41:25.984
Come on.

41:45.118 --> 41:50.384
Look at you.
You're beautiful.

41:50.386 --> 41:51.984
It's yours.

41:51.985 --> 41:53.450
No. I'll borrow it,
but...

41:53.452 --> 41:56.684
Oh, I haven't worn it in ages.

41:56.686 --> 41:59.417
Actually, I think it's...

41:59.419 --> 42:02.250
I think it's the blouse
I wore the first date

42:02.252 --> 42:04.317
I had with Chloe's dad.

42:11.251 --> 42:13.584
Where is Chloe's dad?

42:13.586 --> 42:16.150
Let's just say,

42:16.152 --> 42:21.117
not all men know how to step up
when it comes to being a dad.

42:21.119 --> 42:23.183
And we couldn't have that.
No. No we couldn't.

43:02.552 --> 43:05.550
I just don't understand why she would
plan her first date with this boy

43:05.552 --> 43:08.317
on the night that we're
having Linda over,

43:08.319 --> 43:11.284
knowing full well that Linda can't
come unless she babysits little Chloe.

43:20.518 --> 43:21.684
Oh, come in.

43:21.686 --> 43:23.250
Hello.

43:23.252 --> 43:24.584
Hi, I'm Claude.

43:24.586 --> 43:27.050
Claude.
Hello.

43:27.052 --> 43:29.317
Dad, Janice, meet Claude.

43:29.319 --> 43:31.350
Claude, this is my dad
Dennis, and Janice.

43:31.352 --> 43:33.317
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Emanuel's stepmother.

43:33.319 --> 43:36.150
Nice to meet you.

43:36.152 --> 43:38.617
Oh, that's such a pretty blouse.
Where did you get it?

43:38.619 --> 43:41.517
Okay, well, this has been fun.
Now let's go. Bye.

43:41.519 --> 43:43.350
Maybe you'd like to join
us next Friday night.

43:43.352 --> 43:45.150
It's Emanuel's birthday

43:45.152 --> 43:46.517
and I'm going to be
making her favorite meal,

43:46.519 --> 43:48.584
chicken pot pie.

43:48.586 --> 43:50.517
Sure. Sounds great.
Okay.

43:50.519 --> 43:52.284
Okay, great.
Sounds great.

43:52.286 --> 43:54.350
Have fun.
Bye.

44:07.518 --> 44:10.617
Wanna ride on the back?
Sure.

44:10.619 --> 44:12.117
It's best if you stand.

44:12.119 --> 44:13.350
It's a little tricky getting on,

44:13.352 --> 44:14.617
but once you're up, you're up.

44:14.619 --> 44:16.651
Unless you crash.

44:16.653 --> 44:21.050
Yeah, that wouldn't be good.
But I won't.

44:24.052 --> 44:27.517
Okay?
Yeah.

45:02.085 --> 45:05.117
Well, I hope you're hungry.
I am.

45:05.119 --> 45:06.384
Besides, this is the
first dinner we've had

45:06.386 --> 45:10.584
I love how you're trying
to turn Emanuel's

45:10.586 --> 45:13.651
inconsiderate behavior into some
sort of a romantic evening for us.

45:13.653 --> 45:16.117
Janice, don't.
No, no, that's okay.

45:16.119 --> 45:18.684
I know how it goes. "Emanuel is
fragile. You don't know what

45:18.686 --> 45:20.117
"she's been through.
She's not like other kids."

45:20.119 --> 45:21.217
Let's not do this.

45:21.219 --> 45:22.517
And yes, yes, you're her father

45:22.519 --> 45:24.550
and me having no
children of my own,

45:24.552 --> 45:26.550
I couldn't possibly
know how to raise one.

45:26.552 --> 45:30.150
I didn't say that. Honey.
Yeah, but that's how you feel.

45:30.152 --> 45:32.550
Oh, this music.

46:15.451 --> 46:18.584
I wanted to take
you somewhere nice.

46:18.586 --> 46:21.026
What, you don't appreciate this
romantic fluorescent lighting?

46:23.019 --> 46:25.917
$16.25.

46:33.386 --> 46:35.917
Thanks.

46:35.919 --> 46:38.350
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

46:38.352 --> 46:41.550
It's kind of a personal question.
Okay.

46:41.552 --> 46:43.550
Do you mind?

46:43.552 --> 46:47.484
No, not at all.
I'll just wait outside.

46:47.486 --> 46:50.150
Sometimes, when I'm on my own,

46:50.152 --> 46:53.117
I imagine myself dying.

46:53.119 --> 46:56.050
Life pouring out of
me like an open tap.

46:56.052 --> 46:58.284
Creates this river of my blood.

46:58.286 --> 47:02.083
My question is, have you
ever noticed me float by?

47:02.085 --> 47:04.150
No. I haven't.

47:17.918 --> 47:20.584
I thought this was all privately owned.
It is.

47:20.586 --> 47:23.217
Looks like you're breaking
all kinds of laws tonight.

47:23.219 --> 47:26.983
Stealing, trespassing.
What's next?

47:26.985 --> 47:29.050
Underage drinking.

47:45.152 --> 47:49.517
My dad used to bring
me here a lot as a kid.

47:49.519 --> 47:51.983
Then it got privatized, and we
started going to the other side.

47:51.985 --> 47:56.183
But he knew I didn't
like it as much.

47:56.185 --> 47:58.950
There's just something
special about this spot.

48:02.617 --> 48:05.183
How come you live with your
dad instead of your mom?

48:05.185 --> 48:07.917
Because she's dead.

48:07.919 --> 48:10.683
That's why I have
this tattoo on my arm.

48:10.685 --> 48:13.117
It's the first and only decision
she got to make for me,

48:13.119 --> 48:16.150
what to name me.

48:16.152 --> 48:19.050
My dad thinks it's probably the
name of some boy she had fling with

48:19.052 --> 48:21.350
when she spent a semester in Paris.

48:21.352 --> 48:24.217
But he went along with it anyway.

48:24.219 --> 48:26.284
Stupid.

48:26.617 --> 48:28.584
I like it.

48:28.586 --> 48:30.584
The tattoo.

48:30.586 --> 48:33.517
It's kind of badass, like you.

48:33.519 --> 48:37.517
You think I'm badass.
Yeah. I do.

48:37.519 --> 48:39.683
It's like you live in
your own private world.

48:39.685 --> 48:41.417
And the world the rest of us
live in has nothing on you

48:41.419 --> 48:43.484
because you don't
belong here anyway.

49:39.618 --> 49:42.417
Did you say the youthinator?

49:42.419 --> 49:44.516
I wish I did, but I
said the eukinator.

49:44.518 --> 49:46.983
Uh, that sounds like you...

49:46.985 --> 49:51.150
Hey, Emanuel.
I've just met your lovely friend Arthur.

49:51.152 --> 49:53.384
What are you doing here?

49:53.386 --> 49:55.516
You're sweating.
Are you okay?

49:55.518 --> 49:56.983
You, you look a little red.

49:56.985 --> 49:58.616
Is Chloe okay?

49:58.618 --> 50:01.917
She's fine, except for this cold.
So...

50:01.919 --> 50:04.950
I just thought I would come and see
if maybe you had a little baby...

50:04.952 --> 50:07.724
Nasal... Aspirator.
Nasal aspirator.

50:07.750 --> 50:08.417
Yeah.

50:08.419 --> 50:11.783
Arthur, go help the lady in aisle three.
She's looking for something.

50:11.850 --> 50:14.348
Oh. So, like I said, you just
be kind of ginger with her,

50:14.485 --> 50:19.184
and this will take care of it, I'm sure.
Uh-huh. Thank you. That is perfect.

50:19.286 --> 50:23.417
Oh, um, your stepmother came by and
invited me to your birthday dinner.

50:23.419 --> 50:25.350
I know you can't very
well babysit Chloe

50:25.352 --> 50:27.616
and attend your own party,
so I thought

50:27.618 --> 50:31.083
maybe there's someone that you
know, who you trusted, who, to...

50:31.085 --> 50:32.483
I can do it.

50:32.485 --> 50:34.549
I'm trustworthy and I like children.
So...

50:34.551 --> 50:36.683
Really?
You wouldn't mind?

50:36.685 --> 50:38.083
No. I would not.
Arthur!

50:38.085 --> 50:41.450
I think I'd enjoy it.
Yeah.

50:41.452 --> 50:43.384
Okay.
Well, that's great.

50:43.386 --> 50:45.150
Sure. Um, when?

50:45.152 --> 50:46.583
Oh, um...

50:46.585 --> 50:48.384
Friday at 7:00.
Friday works.

50:48.386 --> 50:50.017
Great.

50:50.019 --> 50:51.650
How much do I owe you for this?

50:51.652 --> 50:55.583
Oh, that's on the house.
That's a gift with purchase.

50:55.585 --> 50:58.117
But this is my actual purchase.

50:58.119 --> 51:01.384
That's correct.
So, it is a purchase

51:01.386 --> 51:04.350
that has now turned into a gift.
For you.

51:06.085 --> 51:08.549
Well, thank you.
Yeah.

51:08.551 --> 51:10.217
Okay, bye.
Okay, bye.

51:10.219 --> 51:12.917
Bye.

51:18.319 --> 51:20.950
What was that?

51:20.952 --> 51:22.592
My heart pumping blood
to everything else.

51:40.984 --> 51:42.217
<i>Start from the start.</i>

51:42.219 --> 51:43.917
<i>This is the start.</i>

51:43.919 --> 51:47.917
No. The part where
she wakes you up.

51:47.919 --> 51:50.217
She's having contractions.
You walk her around the room.

51:50.219 --> 51:53.150
I'm walking her around the bedroom.

51:53.152 --> 51:56.549
The sun is just rising.

51:56.551 --> 52:00.516
She sits by the window.
Window.

52:00.518 --> 52:04.416
The first rays of light
hitting her face.

52:04.418 --> 52:07.117
She smiles at you in a way
you've never seen before.

52:07.119 --> 52:11.284
Like she has a secret
she can't wait to share.

52:11.286 --> 52:15.583
She's beautiful.
Calm.

52:15.585 --> 52:18.983
I sit by her side

52:18.985 --> 52:20.284
counting the minutes
between contractions.

52:20.286 --> 52:23.050
No.

52:23.052 --> 52:26.583
You help her to her feet.

52:26.585 --> 52:30.050
She tells you she loves you.

52:30.052 --> 52:33.549
That she's just had
the most amazing dream.

52:33.551 --> 52:37.950
She was swimming underwater in
a lake and she could breathe.

52:37.952 --> 52:41.317
It was night, yet she could see.

52:41.319 --> 52:43.917
Because the moonlight made
paths through the water like

52:43.919 --> 52:45.983
fingers pointing the way.

52:47.350 --> 52:50.017
She was happy.

52:50.019 --> 52:52.083
Swimming amongst the fishes.

52:58.518 --> 53:01.583
<i>By the time the doctor arrived,</i>

53:01.585 --> 53:06.449
her face had gone ash white.

53:06.451 --> 53:11.516
Her eyes were distant.

53:11.518 --> 53:16.217
But her grip was still strong.

53:20.451 --> 53:23.017
They cut into her

53:23.019 --> 53:25.083
and pulled you out.

53:27.617 --> 53:32.383
You were blue.
Not breathing.

53:34.385 --> 53:40.183
The cord was still wrapped
around your little neck.

53:40.185 --> 53:44.316
The doctor worked on you.

53:44.318 --> 53:45.150
And as you took
your first breath...

53:45.152 --> 53:50.250
She took her last.

53:50.252 --> 53:51.549
They tried to revive her.

53:51.551 --> 53:54.017
But she was gone.

53:54.019 --> 53:55.616
She was gone.

53:55.618 --> 54:00.217
And I was here.

54:00.219 --> 54:02.283
You were here.

54:07.550 --> 54:10.316
And that's everything.
Yeah.

54:10.318 --> 54:12.383
That is everything.

54:20.517 --> 54:24.983
Do you do this to punish me?

54:24.985 --> 54:27.917
I'm just making sure
you've told me everything.

54:28.018 --> 54:30.083
That you haven't left anything out.

55:18.551 --> 55:21.050
Yay!

55:21.052 --> 55:22.210
Happy Birthday, Emanuel!
Yay!

55:24.919 --> 55:27.249
Oh, my little girl is all grown up now.
There's no denying that.

55:27.251 --> 55:29.449
Oh, you'll try.

55:29.451 --> 55:31.516
You have to make the first cut.

55:35.550 --> 55:38.083
You do it.

55:38.085 --> 55:39.616
Okay.
Uh, it, it's...

55:39.618 --> 55:43.083
It's good luck for the birthday
girl to take the first cut.

55:48.118 --> 55:49.483
I'll do it.

55:49.485 --> 55:51.917
Never say no to some good luck.

55:51.919 --> 55:55.983
Right, Claude?
Right.

55:55.985 --> 55:58.549
We would love to
meet little baby Chloe.

55:58.551 --> 56:00.583
Oh, she has such a
terrible cold right now.

56:00.585 --> 56:02.683
Oh.

56:02.685 --> 56:04.349
Um, but in a couple of days,
maybe, when she's not so cranky,

56:04.351 --> 56:05.983
I'll bring her over.

56:05.985 --> 56:08.050
Oh, we would love that.

56:23.117 --> 56:28.683
I'm glad you've formed such
a close bond with Emanuel.

56:28.685 --> 56:31.449
I've been married to her
father for almost a year now

56:31.451 --> 56:36.017
and, well, I wouldn't
exactly call us close.

56:36.019 --> 56:38.416
It's different.
You're her stepmother.

56:38.418 --> 56:41.017
That's a whole different ballgame.

56:41.019 --> 56:43.616
Yeah, I suppose.

56:43.618 --> 56:47.116
I was just hoping that I'd get to
experience a little bit of, uh,

56:47.118 --> 56:50.549
motherhood, with Emanuel.

56:50.551 --> 56:55.983
But, well, I'm seeing that that's
not really in the cards for us.

56:56.985 --> 56:58.516
Well, it's probably just her age.

56:58.518 --> 57:01.683
She's quite a troubled young girl,

57:01.685 --> 57:04.516
and confused in some ways.

57:04.518 --> 57:09.283
I just need you to know that.

57:09.285 --> 57:13.182
I just don't want her misinterpreting
your fondness for her.

57:13.184 --> 57:16.116
I'm not really sure what you mean.

57:16.118 --> 57:19.549
She has never had a mother.

57:19.551 --> 57:24.583
And I think that that has
created a longing in her,

57:24.585 --> 57:28.316
that's, um, not right.

57:30.318 --> 57:35.116
You know, confused.

57:35.118 --> 57:38.082
I think we were all a bit
confused at that age.

57:38.084 --> 57:40.349
I think it's important that
you make it clear to Emanuel

57:40.351 --> 57:42.416
your interest in men.

57:46.517 --> 57:49.449
You are interested in, uh,

57:49.451 --> 57:51.516
men, are you not?

58:04.284 --> 58:06.416
Claude works in a nursery.

58:06.418 --> 58:08.950
I've seen you a lot in your yard.

58:08.952 --> 58:11.549
Perhaps he could help you,
uh, plant your flowers.

58:11.551 --> 58:13.616
I would love that.

58:23.919 --> 58:26.983
Come in.

58:26.985 --> 58:29.516
Hi.

58:29.518 --> 58:33.182
Hey.

58:33.184 --> 58:36.483
Wow, I like your room.

58:38.485 --> 58:41.249
It's so different from
the rest of the house.

58:43.550 --> 58:46.349
How?

58:46.351 --> 58:50.316
I don't know.
Just feels like you.

58:57.518 --> 58:59.650
Is this your mother?

58:59.652 --> 59:02.650
What was her name?
Ava.

59:02.652 --> 59:05.316
You look a lot like her.

59:09.318 --> 59:14.216
She's got an air of mystery
and intrigue about her,

59:14.218 --> 59:16.683
like someone you've
known for many years,

59:16.685 --> 59:20.149
but you never really knew them.

59:20.151 --> 59:22.583
She certainly pulled that off.

59:22.585 --> 59:27.616
She left nothing behind.
Not a trace.

59:28.518 --> 59:32.249
She left you.

59:32.251 --> 59:35.016
That's a pretty big trace.

59:45.485 --> 59:48.416
Oh, there you are.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.016
Well, uh, it's getting late.

59:50.018 --> 59:53.082
I'm sure Claude needs
to be getting home.

59:53.084 --> 59:55.149
Well, I should probably
be getting home too.

01:00:09.384 --> 01:00:11.549
Thanks for coming and
sitting through that.

01:00:11.551 --> 01:00:13.916
I'm glad I came.
Really?

01:00:13.918 --> 01:00:17.149
Yeah. I mean, everyone's
family is a little odd.

01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:19.316
If it's not, then it's
not really a family.

01:00:19.318 --> 01:00:21.416
So that uncomfortable,
annoyed feeling I get

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:24.149
whenever I walk in the house
is just telling me I'm home.

01:00:24.151 --> 01:00:27.049
Yeah, pretty much.

01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:29.516
I feel the same.

01:00:29.518 --> 01:00:33.082
Same as?
Before.

01:00:33.084 --> 01:00:37.182
It's stupid, but somehow
every year on my birthday

01:00:37.184 --> 01:00:40.916
I have this feeling that this
year I'll feel different.

01:00:40.918 --> 01:00:43.016
But it never happens.

01:00:43.018 --> 01:00:45.949
Different how?
I don't know.

01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:48.116
Doesn't matter.

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:53.216
Okay.
Well, of course.

01:00:53.218 --> 01:00:56.049
Who's that?
He's my friend from work.

01:00:56.051 --> 01:00:58.683
He was babysitting.

01:00:58.685 --> 01:01:01.583
I'm gonna be landscaping for her.

01:01:01.585 --> 01:01:04.650
What?

01:01:04.652 --> 01:01:07.216
Yeah. Your dad hooked it up.
You know, because I work at the nursery.

01:01:07.218 --> 01:01:09.616
I mean, she may not hire me, but I
think I could do a pretty good job.

01:01:09.618 --> 01:01:12.650
Look, I don't necessarily
want to see you all the time.

01:01:12.652 --> 01:01:14.583
I mean, you've been in
my house twice already.

01:01:14.585 --> 01:01:15.198
What?

01:01:15.224 --> 01:01:16.850
I can't get on the train
without you being there

01:01:16.852 --> 01:01:20.879
and now I can't even babysit without
you being just outside the window?

01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:25.516
Well, if that's how you really
feel, I'll make it easy for you.

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:28.449
You don't have to see me at all.

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.483
This one or this one?

01:02:04.485 --> 01:02:06.249
Either.

01:02:06.251 --> 01:02:08.650
Yeah, I agree.

01:02:08.652 --> 01:02:12.216
Uh, you're fine with me going
out with Arthur, right?

01:02:12.218 --> 01:02:18.049
Yeah. I just don't think he's
boyfriend material for you.

01:02:18.051 --> 01:02:20.616
<i>Just dinner. Probably end
up just being friends.</i>

01:02:20.618 --> 01:02:24.949
I mean, it's all I can really
handle right now anyway.

01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:27.982
Would be kind of nice, though.

01:02:27.984 --> 01:02:31.049
Can't be the three of
us forever and ever.

01:02:33.651 --> 01:02:35.916
I think she's hungry.

01:02:46.017 --> 01:02:47.916
She has really grown a lot

01:02:47.918 --> 01:02:50.982
over the last couple of weeks,
don't you think?

01:02:56.151 --> 01:02:58.483
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:02:58.485 --> 01:03:01.949
I can tell him you don't feel well,
or that Chloe's sick.

01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:03.383
He would totally understand.

01:03:03.385 --> 01:03:06.982
It's okay.

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.982
I'm gonna be home soon.
This is not going to be a late night.

01:03:08.984 --> 01:03:09.916
How do I look?

01:03:12.117 --> 01:03:14.516
You look beautiful.

01:03:14.518 --> 01:03:16.583
Okay, bye.

01:03:19.983 --> 01:03:22.049
Bye.

01:03:54.683 --> 01:03:59.216
I think she's starting to love
me the way she loves you.

01:03:59.218 --> 01:04:03.650
That's how it feels.

01:04:03.652 --> 01:04:06.583
It's how I've always
imagined it would feel.

01:04:53.984 --> 01:04:55.949
Thank you.

01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:57.949
It's just the, the
fermenting of a fruit.

01:04:57.951 --> 01:05:01.283
Oh, there you are.

01:05:01.285 --> 01:05:02.615
Chloe isn't still awake,
is she?

01:05:02.617 --> 01:05:05.082
No, she's fast asleep.
Good.

01:05:05.084 --> 01:05:07.682
Arthur wants to take a peek.
No.

01:05:07.684 --> 01:05:11.649
I mean, I had a hard time putting
her down. What if she wakes up?

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:18.149
Just gonna have to be very quiet.

01:05:18.151 --> 01:05:19.982
Don't.
No, don't worry. I'm doing okay.

01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:23.516
I think you'd be
really proud of me.

01:05:23.518 --> 01:05:26.116
I like your make-up.
Please.

01:05:26.317 --> 01:05:28.982
Please just stay downstairs.

01:05:28.984 --> 01:05:30.716
Are you coming?

01:05:48.984 --> 01:05:51.283
Oh. She's so pretty.

01:05:51.285 --> 01:05:53.349
Isn't she beautiful?

01:06:01.616 --> 01:06:06.016
Seems a little stiff.

01:06:08.018 --> 01:06:10.082
<i>Not blinking actually.</i>

01:06:12.417 --> 01:06:14.449
Like, not real.

01:06:14.451 --> 01:06:18.349
Yeah, she is special.

01:06:18.351 --> 01:06:22.416
I guess every mother thinks
about their kid like that.

01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:30.249
So want to go downstairs
and have a drink?

01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:33.383
Yeah.

01:06:33.385 --> 01:06:34.449
That's not the baby.

01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:37.016
<i>It's fake.</i>

01:06:37.018 --> 01:06:40.082
This is a doll.
Where's your actual baby?

01:06:45.683 --> 01:06:47.949
Linda?

01:06:58.083 --> 01:07:01.949
Where's my baby?
Where's my baby?

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:05.249
Okay, we're gonna find her.
Where's Chloe?

01:07:05.251 --> 01:07:08.049
Don't. I'm sure Emanuel put
her down somewhere else.

01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:13.016
Where is she?
Hey, Emanuel?

01:07:15.018 --> 01:07:16.649
<i>Emanuel?</i>

01:07:16.651 --> 01:07:20.049
<i>We'll find her. It's okay.
Where is she?</i>

01:07:21.385 --> 01:07:24.049
Where's Chloe?
Hey, Emanuel?

01:07:24.051 --> 01:07:26.082
Emanuel!

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.249
<i>Emanuel?</i>

01:07:29.018 --> 01:07:32.615
<i>She said she was...
Emanuel!</i>

01:07:32.617 --> 01:07:37.116
<i>She's supposed
to be up here.</i>

01:07:37.118 --> 01:07:39.482
Where's Chloe?

01:07:39.484 --> 01:07:43.316
In her crib.

01:07:43.318 --> 01:07:45.383
Where?

01:07:45.385 --> 01:07:48.349
Right there.

01:07:48.351 --> 01:07:51.448
It's a doll.
Where's Linda's baby?

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:52.949
That's her, Arthur.

01:07:52.951 --> 01:07:54.349
This isn't funny, Emanuel.

01:07:54.351 --> 01:07:55.949
What do you know, Arthur?

01:07:55.951 --> 01:07:59.216
What the fuck do you
know about anything?

01:07:59.218 --> 01:08:01.049
Emanuel, please.

01:08:01.051 --> 01:08:03.482
Emanuel, please.

01:08:05.484 --> 01:08:10.482
Please, where is she?

01:08:10.484 --> 01:08:12.383
Look.
Answer me!

01:08:12.385 --> 01:08:14.082
Where is she?

01:08:14.084 --> 01:08:15.649
You answer me right now!

01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:17.515
What have you done with her?
Give me my baby!

01:08:17.517 --> 01:08:19.182
Okay, okay. Hey, hey! Hey!
Give her to me!

01:08:19.184 --> 01:08:21.182
Give her to me!
Hey! Hey! It's okay. We'll find her.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:22.149
Emanuel!
Where is she?

01:08:22.151 --> 01:08:23.916
I'll call the police.

01:08:23.917 --> 01:08:26.049
Hey!
Give her to me! Where is she?

01:08:26.051 --> 01:08:27.249
All right.
It's okay.

01:08:27.251 --> 01:08:28.948
Emanuel!
It's okay.

01:08:28.951 --> 01:08:31.082
Where is Chloe?

01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:31.682
<i>Emanuel.</i>

01:11:35.284 --> 01:11:39.015
<i>Emanuel, can you hear me?</i>

01:11:42.617 --> 01:11:48.916
Em?
Can you hear me?

01:11:48.918 --> 01:11:50.982
Take it slow, now. Okay.

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:04.315
Can you stay here with Linda?

01:12:04.317 --> 01:12:06.649
I need to go with Emanuel
to the hospital.

01:12:06.651 --> 01:12:09.582
Can you do that?
She shouldn't be left alone.

01:12:17.216 --> 01:12:19.682
We've located Linda's husband.

01:12:19.684 --> 01:12:22.348
He's flying in.

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:24.682
But I still need you to
answer some questions.

01:12:24.684 --> 01:12:29.148
She's in no fit state to
answer these questions.

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:34.615
I think it's time you told
your father about the baby.

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:39.049
Emanuel, pumpkin?

01:12:39.051 --> 01:12:42.982
You have to answer
the officer's questions.

01:12:43.984 --> 01:12:46.082
She's gone back to the water.

01:12:47.084 --> 01:12:48.600
She's with Mom.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.516
I tried to stop her,
but she got away.

01:12:54.984 --> 01:13:00.148
They both swam away.
They left me.

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.248
All right, that's all for tonight.

01:13:36.217 --> 01:13:39.982
I just wish you'd said
something before this happened.

01:13:39.984 --> 01:13:42.016
Why would I say anything that
would get Linda pulled out

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:46.282
of her perfect world and into this?
What's so great about this?

01:13:46.284 --> 01:13:50.181
I don't want you to cut me out, Em.

01:13:50.183 --> 01:13:52.016
This may not be the greatest world,
I may not be the greatest,

01:13:52.018 --> 01:13:55.148
but this,
it's what you've got.

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:58.448
We've all gotta work
with what we've got.

01:13:58.450 --> 01:14:01.982
We don't do that, we're lost.

01:14:01.984 --> 01:14:03.481
It's a long way back.

01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:35.148
What are you doing with that?
Oh, um...

01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:37.916
You can't, uh,
wash an item like this.

01:14:37.918 --> 01:14:40.015
It has to be dry cleaned.

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:59.348
If you want to talk
about any of this,

01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:03.148
now or whenever, I'm here.

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:09.148
I understand more
than you think I do.

01:15:09.150 --> 01:15:10.548
You know, about Linda?

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:13.682
And what she's going through.

01:15:13.684 --> 01:15:17.916
I can't have kids.

01:15:17.918 --> 01:15:22.215
You know my first husband,
he left me because of it.

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:25.315
And the grief that I felt...

01:15:27.317 --> 01:15:32.148
It almost put me over the edge.

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:33.748
Anyway, that's all.

01:16:02.317 --> 01:16:04.015
Sorry about the other night.

01:16:36.183 --> 01:16:39.048
<i>Trying for a baby was my idea.</i>

01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:43.315
Uh, I actually thought it
might fix things between us.

01:16:43.317 --> 01:16:46.148
Five years and nearly

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:50.148
$100,000 later,
we finally had our baby.

01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:53.615
By then our marriage
was all but over.

01:16:53.617 --> 01:16:58.482
And then, uh...

01:16:58.484 --> 01:17:00.148
Linda blamed herself.

01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:04.682
She was the, uh, she was
the one who found her.

01:17:04.684 --> 01:17:10.248
Autopsy was inconclusive, so we'll
never really know what happened.

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:17.248
My wife refused to go to the burial.
She just couldn't.

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:20.482
That's when the doll happened.

01:17:20.484 --> 01:17:25.015
I tried to get her committed
and she disappeared.

01:17:25.017 --> 01:17:29.215
So that's when I went to the police station
and filed a missing person's report.

01:17:29.217 --> 01:17:31.482
What's her prognosis?

01:17:31.484 --> 01:17:36.649
Doctors seem less than optimistic.

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:40.148
I want to see her.

01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:43.415
You don't want to see her.
Not, not like this.

01:17:43.417 --> 01:17:44.548
Besides, it's not possible.

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:48.915
They're only allowing family.

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:54.981
You okay?
Can you get me in to see Linda?

01:17:54.983 --> 01:17:58.015
Close the door.

01:17:58.017 --> 01:18:00.615
Em, this obsession
with Linda has to stop.

01:18:00.617 --> 01:18:03.015
She's not your mother.

01:18:03.017 --> 01:18:05.382
She's nothing like your mother.
You hear me?

01:18:05.384 --> 01:18:07.482
That doesn't mean she doesn't
deserve to be saved.

01:18:07.484 --> 01:18:10.215
I'm sure the doctors are doing
everything they can to help her.

01:18:10.217 --> 01:18:11.948
Like they did for Mom!
Emanuel.

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:13.582
Her husband is gonna
let her rot in there.

01:18:13.584 --> 01:18:15.115
You don't know what's
in people's hearts.

01:18:15.141 --> 01:18:15.648
No!

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:19.181
But I know what's in mine.

01:18:49.382 --> 01:18:50.481
Okay?

01:19:09.651 --> 01:19:11.348
Thank you for this.

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:30.215
Where's Chloe?

01:21:30.217 --> 01:21:32.948
I have her.

01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:37.181
Is she okay?

01:21:37.183 --> 01:21:40.215
No?

01:21:40.217 --> 01:21:42.715
Did you hurt her?

01:21:46.517 --> 01:21:48.582
She was already hurt.

01:21:50.584 --> 01:21:52.215
Well, I want to see her.
Where is she?

01:22:00.217 --> 01:22:01.781
What happened?

01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:13.148
What happened?

01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:19.648
The tide came up.

01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:24.148
I was holding her hand
and it took her away.

01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:28.081
Why didn't you hold her closer?

01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:31.415
I just couldn't.

01:22:31.417 --> 01:22:36.415
Tide was too strong.

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:39.148
It took us to where the water is

01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:42.982
the deepest darkest blue
you've ever seen.

01:22:43.983 --> 01:22:49.215
And we were happy, swimming
amongst the fishes.

01:22:49.217 --> 01:22:52.348
Then Chloe let go of my hand.

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:55.181
And I was scared.

01:22:55.183 --> 01:22:59.415
But actually, for me,
not for her.

01:22:59.417 --> 01:23:01.282
She knew exactly
what she was doing

01:23:01.284 --> 01:23:03.382
and where she was going.

01:23:03.384 --> 01:23:07.547
I lost sight of her.

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:12.348
And then the fishes
brought me back here.

01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:16.981
Why?
Why did they bring you back?

01:23:16.983 --> 01:23:19.382
For you.

01:24:12.182 --> 01:24:14.248
This is the place.

01:25:17.082 --> 01:25:19.148
Okay?

01:25:59.082 --> 01:26:02.015
That's good.
