08:55.622 --> 08:57.319
AND LIVED TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

09:02.846 --> 09:03.934
LUKE: I WAS ABLE TO COMPARE
ENTRY AND EXIT FOOTAGE

09:03.978 --> 09:05.240
FROM THE TIME OF THE THEFT
AND TRACK DOWN

09:05.283 --> 09:06.981
WHO BROKE INTO
THE EVIDENCE ROOM FIRST.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.852
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
- DEE WORKS

09:08.896 --> 09:10.854
AT THE GCPD
PROCESSING DESK.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.726
SHE'S ONE OF A FEW PEOPLE
WHO HAVE ACCESS

09:12.769 --> 09:14.249
TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM
SECURE BACK AREA.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.033
DEE ALSO CALLED IN
SICK TODAY,

AND THIS LADY'S NEVER
CALLED IN SICK ONCE
IN 20 YEARS.

09:18.949 --> 09:22.474
OK, BUT ALL THE ITEMS
IN THE EVIDENCE ROOM,

09:22.518 --> 09:24.476
THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING EASIER
TO FENCE.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.348
WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT.
WHY WOULD ANYONE

09:26.391 --> 09:27.784
RISK EVERYTHING
FOR THIS STUFF APART

09:27.828 --> 09:29.525
FROM THE GUY
WHO INVENTED IT?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.222
WAIT. YOU MEAN
THE MR. FREEZE DUDE?

09:31.266 --> 09:33.442
- I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.
- VICTOR FRIES. HE IS.

09:33.485 --> 09:34.922

09:34.965 --> 09:36.445
HALF A DOZEN DOCTORATES,

09:36.488 --> 09:38.839
STILL INSISTED ON BEING
CALLED MR. FREEZE,

09:38.882 --> 09:42.799
BUT THEN AGAIN,
CAPTAIN COLD WASN'T
REALLY A CAPTAIN, SO...

09:42.843 --> 09:44.540
WHO'S THAT?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.586
AH, YES.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.675
THAT IS NORA FRIES

09:48.718 --> 09:51.634
IN AN ARKHAM INTAKE PHOTO
TAKEN 3 YEARS AGO.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.767
SO NORA WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH MacGREGOR'S SYNDROME,

09:53.810 --> 09:55.943
A PROGRESSIVE LUNG DISEASE
THAT AT THE TIME

09:55.986 --> 09:57.814
OF HER DIAGNOSIS
HAD NO CURE,

09:57.858 --> 10:00.991
SO VICTOR CREATED A UNIQUE
LIQUID NITROGEN FORMULA

10:01.035 --> 10:03.428
TO SUPPLY HER CRYOCHAMBER
THAT KEPT HER IN STASIS

10:03.472 --> 10:05.039
UNTIL A CURE
COULD BE FOUND.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.954
AND HE DIED
BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.217
WELL, EVENTUALLY,
HER CRYOCHAMBER RAN OUT

10:09.260 --> 10:11.175
OF VICTOR'S
LIQUID NITROGEN COCKTAIL,

10:11.219 --> 10:13.743
SO WHEN SHE THAWED,
NORA LEARNED

10:13.787 --> 10:16.006
THAT DOCTORS FOUND
A CURE FOR MacGREGOR'S,

10:16.050 --> 10:18.530
SO THEY ADMINISTERED IT,
BUT SHE WAS SO DISORIENTED

10:18.574 --> 10:20.315
BY THE 20-YEAR TIME GAP
THAT OFFICIALS

10:20.358 --> 10:21.795
SENT HER TO ARKHAM.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.535
SHE ESCAPED IN A BREAKOUT
3 YEARS AGO

10:23.579 --> 10:25.102
AND HAS BEEN MIA
EVER SINCE.

10:25.146 --> 10:28.062
- SO WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?
- DEE SMITHY IS

10:28.105 --> 10:31.369
NORA FRIES' SISTER.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.415
SEND ME THE ADDRESS.
I'LL FIRE UP
THE BATMOBILE.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.546
OK.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.244
[ALARM BLARING]

10:36.287 --> 10:37.941
UH, WHO'S BOUNCING
A BASKETBALL

10:37.985 --> 10:40.291
OFF OF BRUCE WAYNE'S
SHELF OF FIRST EDITIONS?

10:40.335 --> 10:44.731
THAT WOULD BE...
MY BROTHER.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.255
MAN: â™ª JUST WHEN YOU THINK
YOU KNOW THE GAME â™ª

10:47.298 --> 10:49.779
â™ª I CHANGE THE RULES

10:49.823 --> 10:51.999
â™ª YOU THOUGHT YOU
HAD IT FIGURED OUT â™ª

10:52.042 --> 10:54.175

GOT REFLEXES.

10:57.178 --> 11:00.224
YEAH. IN ALL MY SPARE TIME.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.052
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:02.096 --> 11:04.185
FREE FOR A DRINK
LATER?

11:04.228 --> 11:06.143
JADA DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT ME?

11:06.187 --> 11:09.538
TELL ME WHAT, WILDER?

11:09.581 --> 11:11.714
SHE MADE IT VERY CLEAR
SHE WANTED

11:11.758 --> 11:15.065
NOTHING TO DO
WITH WAYNE ENTERPRISES

11:15.109 --> 11:17.502
AND THAT I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

11:17.546 --> 11:21.115
OOH! YOU RUFFLED
SOME FEATHERS.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.247
WHAT'D YOU DO?
BECAUSE NORMALLY,

11:23.291 --> 11:25.293
SHE EATS THAT RAGS
TO RICHES STUFF UP.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.469
REMINDS HER OF HERSELF.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.471
SO YOU THINK YOU
KNOW MY STORY?

11:31.778 --> 11:35.999

STINT AT BLACKGATE,

11:36.043 --> 11:39.481
AND NOW...ACTING CEO
OF WAYNE.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.656
OH, AND, UH,

11:40.700 --> 11:43.311
YOU'RE MY SISTER.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.747
SHE TOLD YOU THAT?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.009
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

11:49.447 --> 11:50.797
HOW DID YOU FIGURE
THIS OUT?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.320
OH, NANNYIES TALK

11:52.363 --> 11:53.974
LIKE MINE DID WHEN MOMS
DISAPPEARED

11:54.017 --> 11:55.758
FOR 9 MONTHS STRAIGHT.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.368
HEARD ABOUT IT
AS A KID YEARS LATER.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.761
WHY HER AND MY OLD MAN
DIDN'T SPEAK

11:58.805 --> 12:01.677
FOR A FULL SUMMER
AFTER THAT.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
SO IT WAS AN AFFAIR.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.464
THEN WE FAST FORWARD
27 YEARS,

12:06.508 --> 12:09.424
HERE'S SOME BADASS CHICK
ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN ME,

12:09.467 --> 12:12.819
SHOWS UP AT THE COMPANY,
THROWS MY MOM OFF HER GAME,

12:12.862 --> 12:14.777
AND HAS GOT HER SCHEDULING
ALL THESE SECRET MEETINGS

12:14.821 --> 12:17.171
WHILE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
OUT OF TOWN.

12:17.214 --> 12:20.000
POOF! HERE YOU ARE,

12:20.043 --> 12:21.828

I HAD.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.006
I--I WOULD ASK YOU
FOR A HUG,

12:26.049 --> 12:28.182
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
COULD KICK MY ASS, SO...

12:30.445 --> 12:32.795
PRETTY SURE YOUR MOM
MIGHT BEAT ME TO IT.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.188
OUR MOM.

12:36.364 --> 12:39.280
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE HERE.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.978
BUT I ALREADY PICKED OUT
MY OFFICE NEXT TO YOURS.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.807
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- BECAUSE IT'S THE CORNER.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.288
WAY BETTER VIEW.
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

12:47.331 --> 12:48.637
WHY YOU'RE IN THIS PLACE.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.074
IT'S SO...LIMITED.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.512
YOU WANT TO PARTNER
WITH WAYNE ENTERPRISES?

12:57.037 --> 12:58.473

IN THIS

12:58.516 --> 13:01.084
JUST FOR THE PJs
AND FREE CONCERT TICKETS,

13:01.128 --> 13:03.478
WHICH WOULD MEAN I'D BE
AN HONORARY VP

13:03.521 --> 13:06.220
UNTIL SHE'S DEAD
IN HER LOUBIES

13:06.263 --> 13:08.352
UNLESS I MAKE MY MARK,

13:08.396 --> 13:10.267
SHOW HER WHAT I CAN DO.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.400
SAME WITH YOU.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.184
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER
WHAT SHE MISSED OUT ON

13:14.228 --> 13:16.186

13:16.230 --> 13:18.101
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SIS?

13:18.145 --> 13:19.842
WANT TO JOIN FORCES,

13:19.886 --> 13:21.539
SHOW HER WHAT WE GOT?

13:23.193 --> 13:25.152

THINK ABOUT IT?

13:25.195 --> 13:26.936
RYAN: I COULDN'T
EXACTLY ASK HIM TO
WAIT IN THE LOBBY

13:26.980 --> 13:29.504
WHILE I FOLLOWED THE 20
ON A MISSING FREEZE TANK.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.288
WHAT EXACTLY IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

13:31.332 --> 13:32.942
WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A BROTHER.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.857
OK. I GET THAT,
BUT JADA JET

13:34.901 --> 13:36.728

13:38.730 --> 13:41.385

TO DESTROY WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.387
OK, OK.
I'M IN DEE'S HOUSE.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.867
WE'RE LATE TO THE PARTY.
SOMEONE WAS HERE,

13:44.911 --> 13:46.695
AND IT GOT UGLY.

13:46.738 --> 13:49.306
NO SIGN OF DEE
OR THE FREEZE TANK

13:49.350 --> 13:51.352
OR THE ROOMMATE
WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

I THINK NORA'S
LIVING HERE.

THEY FOUND THE CURE

14:07.629 --> 14:09.109
MAYBE IT DIDN'T TAKE.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.417
MAYBE DEE WANTED TO
PUT NORA BACK

14:13.461 --> 14:15.985
IN HER CRYOCHAMBER TO
SAVE HER SISTER'S LIFE.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.769
SO WHO BROKE
INTO THE HOUSE?

14:17.813 --> 14:19.946
SOMEONE AFTER
THE SAME THING?

14:19.989 --> 14:23.036

KNOW WHERE ONE WOULD
FIND A CRYOCHAMBER.

ABOUT ACE CHEMICALS?

14:24.907 --> 14:27.779

EVER HAPPENED THERE.

THE ADDRESS NOW.

WAS GONNA PUT ME ON ICE,

14:50.759 --> 14:52.630
AND NOW I GOT A GUN
ON MY BAD HIP.

I'M GONNA DO, RUN?

OF A MADMAN.

YOU GOT TO SHOW ME
HOW IT WORKS.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.164

THE FIRST THING ABOUT THAT?

SCIENCE TO WOMEN

AT UNIVERSITY.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.801
I DO NOT LOVE LUKE...

I'D KEEP THAT
TO YOURSELF.

IGNORE YOU, MARY.

NOT SEE YOUR PLACE
ON THIS TEAM?

FOR LESS THAN A MONTH,

18:48.257 --> 18:50.520
AND IT'S ALREADY
GLARINGLY OBVIOUS.

18:50.564 --> 18:54.176
THEY DON'T SEE YOU
UNLESS THEY NEED YOU

18:54.220 --> 18:55.960
JUST LIKE DADDY

18:56.004 --> 18:58.267
AND JUST LIKE KATE,

18:58.311 --> 19:01.749
SO IF YOU WANT TO
GO ON LIKING THEM,

19:01.792 --> 19:04.447
IT'S PROBABLY BEST
YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE.

ON SOME MAJOR FIREPOWER

19:14.979 --> 19:16.720

IT DOESN'T WORK.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.563
DEE: CAN IT, NORA.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.086
DO YOU THINK WE'RE
WALKING OUT OF HERE?

19:35.130 --> 19:36.566
HAVE YOU SEEN
THEIR FACES?

19:36.610 --> 19:38.351
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT DOESN'T WORK?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.222
DEE: IT WORKS FINE.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.616
JUST A LITTLE DUST,
A FEW DISINFECTANT WIPES.

19:42.659 --> 19:45.096
THE CHAMBER WORKS.
IT'LL FREEZE YOU SOLID,

19:45.140 --> 19:47.403
BUT YOU DIE OF HYPOTHERMIA
EVENTUALLY.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.710
WELL, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THIS STUFF?

19:49.753 --> 19:51.799
CONSTANT EXPOSURE
TO THE FREEZE SERUM

19:51.842 --> 19:54.018
WILL STOP TIME
AND KEEP YOU FROM AGING.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.891
COMING OUT OF IT'S
A WHOLE OTHER STORY.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.980
LOOK. MY HUSBAND
WAS BRILLIANT,

19:59.023 --> 20:01.112
BUT HE DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT ONCE I WAS RELEASED

20:01.156 --> 20:02.984
FROM THE CHAMBER
AND THAWED

20:03.027 --> 20:04.812
TIME WOULD CATCH UP.

20:04.855 --> 20:08.119
3 YEARS AGO, I CAME OUT
OF THAT THING A 34-YEAR-OLD,

20:08.163 --> 20:09.817
AND LOOK AT ME NOW.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.602
AT THIS RATE, I'LL BE
122 BY CHRISTMAS.
