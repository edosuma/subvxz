WELL, SEE, THAT ONE'S
UP TO THE CONDUCTOR,

00:45.828 --> 00:47.917

I DON'T KNOW.
HOW MUCH CAN YOU?

09:07.938 --> 09:11.333
SO IS IT WEIRD FOR YOU,

09:11.333 --> 09:13.291
LIKE, HANGING OUT
WITH SARAH'S BOYFRIEND?

09:13.291 --> 09:14.945
NO, HE'S COOL,

09:14.945 --> 09:17.339
AND I'M GLAD
SHE'S GOT SOMEBODY.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.341
AT LEAST SHE SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S IN A BETTER MOOD

09:19.341 --> 09:20.951
NOW THAT THEY'RE DATING.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.170
MM-HMM.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.345
MAYBE THAT'S 'CAUSE--
YOU KNOW.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.217
YOU KNOW.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.220
Natalie: WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR CARDIO, MAN?

09:29.220 --> 09:30.700
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
THE CASE ACTUALLY.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.484
THEY'RE BOTH STILL...

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
THE BIG "V."

09:35.618 --> 09:37.359
OH.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.014
YEAH. THEY'VE
NEVER ACTUALLY--

09:41.232 --> 09:42.625
REALLY?

09:42.625 --> 09:45.236
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?
PUMPING IRON, MAN.

09:45.236 --> 09:48.239
I KNOW SHE DEFINITELY
WANTS TO LOSE HER--

09:48.239 --> 09:49.589
[WHISPERS]
virginity.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.592
AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY
THINKING ABOUT IT, TOO.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.030
WHAT POSSIBLE REASON
COULD THEY HAVE
FOR WANTING TO WAIT?

09:56.030 --> 09:58.859
♪ BAILEY AND ELLIOT
SITTIN' IN A TREE ♪

09:58.859 --> 10:01.078
♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪

10:01.078 --> 10:02.645
♪ FIRST COMES LOVE ♪

10:02.645 --> 10:04.038
♪ THEN COMES MARRIAGE ♪

10:04.038 --> 10:05.256
NO WAY.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.607
THEN COMES BAILEY
PUSHING A BABY CARRIAGE.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.695
NO WAY!

10:11.611 --> 10:13.221
NO WAY.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.792
I FEEL LIKE A GROUNDHOG.

10:18.792 --> 10:22.796
LIKE--LIKE IF I OPEN THIS
AND SEE MY SHADOW,

10:22.796 --> 10:24.754
I'M GOING TO HAVE
6 MORE WEEKS OF RADIATION.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.408
WELL, EVEN IF I'M CURED,

10:26.408 --> 10:29.411
I'M STILL GOING
TO HAVE 6 WEEKS
OF FOLLOW-UP RADIATION

10:29.411 --> 10:31.369
JUST TO MAKE SURE
THEY GOT IT ALL,

10:31.369 --> 10:32.806
SO IT DOESN'T--

10:32.806 --> 10:35.286
MAYBE HEMINGWAY
HAD THE RIGHT IDEA.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.418
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:36.418 --> 10:38.028
SOON AS HE FOUND OUT
HE WAS SICK,

10:38.028 --> 10:39.900
HE BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.292
KEVIN, GOD, COME ON.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.860
YOU--YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN OPENED IT YET.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.296
YOU OPEN IT.
I'M A COWARD.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.603
NO.

10:47.603 --> 10:51.041
I--I DON'T WANT
TO BE THE ONE
THAT TELLS YOU.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.434
WHAT IF IT'S GOOD NEWS?

10:52.434 --> 10:54.958
THEN YOU SHOULD
READ IT YOURSELF.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.525
I'M JUST--I'M HERE
FOR MORAL SUPPORT,

10:56.525 --> 10:58.092
EITHER WAY,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

11:04.098 --> 11:08.232
IF IT'S BAD NEWS,
THERE GOES MY HAIRLINE.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.367
CHEMO--THAT'S BRUTAL.

11:12.367 --> 11:18.025
IF IT'S GOOD, IT MEANS
RADIATION WORKS.

11:18.025 --> 11:21.376
YOU KNOW, I GOT A LOT
RIDING ON THIS, TOO.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.292
OK.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.511
HERE GOES.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.826
"RESULTS OF CBC, NEGATIVE.

11:36.826 --> 11:40.177
"ESR, NORMAL.

11:40.177 --> 11:43.528
NECK AND CHEST
CAT SCANS, NEGATIVE."

11:43.528 --> 11:47.010
NEGATIVE. THAT'S
POSITIVE, RIGHT?

11:47.010 --> 11:51.667
GOD. I'M--I'M, UH--
LOOK AT THIS.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.322
REMISSION. IT SAYS, UH--

11:54.322 --> 11:57.020
"YOU ARE--"
THAT'S--

11:57.020 --> 11:59.022
I'M OK.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.023
YOU'RE OK.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.068
I'M OK!

12:01.068 --> 12:03.984
YOU'RE OK.

12:03.984 --> 12:06.508
RADIATION WORKS!
RADIATION WORKS!

12:12.253 --> 12:14.168
YES!

12:14.168 --> 12:15.125
YES!

12:20.391 --> 12:22.045
HI. DO YOU, UH--

12:22.045 --> 12:23.438

NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.237
I'LL LET YOU CUT IT.

12:40.237 --> 12:44.024
WHAT'S WITH THE UMS
AND LIKES?

12:44.024 --> 12:47.070
IT'S JUST HOW WE TALK.
IT'S REAL.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.289
IT'S UNINTELLIGIBLE.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.900
WHEW. LET'S GO AGAIN.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.990
GIVE ME A SLATE.

FRIENDLY SERVICE

13:23.106 --> 13:26.631
Photographer:
OK, WE'LL, UH,
EDIT THIS DOWN,

13:26.631 --> 13:28.372
SLAP SOME TITLES ON.
YOU'LL BE IN BUSINESS.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.026
THANKS.
THAT'S GREAT, MAN.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.332
HEY, I'M JUST GLAD
TO BE DOING A SHOOT

13:31.332 --> 13:34.552
WHERE THE ACTORS
KEEP THEIR CLOTHES ON.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.040
CHARLIE, YOU'VE
GOT TO SEE THIS.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.217
HEY.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.740
THAT'S MY CHAIR.

13:48.740 --> 13:49.959
COOL.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.047
YOU BET. SIT DOWN.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.572
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

13:54.572 --> 13:56.574
OUR FUTURE, CHARLES,
THAT'S WHAT.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.838
I MEAN, HELL,
WE'RE BOTH GOING
TO BE FINE,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.840
SO NOW'S THE TIME
TO START THINKING AHEAD

14:00.840 --> 14:04.191
AND MAKING SOME
SERIOUS PLANS.

14:04.191 --> 14:07.107
WELL, THAT'S, UH--
WHAT KIND OF PLANS?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.152
YOU AND ME
IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.111
NOW, THIS IS PRIMITIVE
COMPARED TO WHAT
IT WILL BE

14:11.111 --> 14:12.503
ONCE I CUSTOMIZE
THE SOFTWARE,

14:12.503 --> 14:13.896
BUT LOOK AT THIS.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.898
SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE SOMETHING.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.857
JUST CLICK AND DRAG.
NO MORE ERASING.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.249
WAIT, WAIT.
SOFTWARE?

14:19.249 --> 14:21.251
A PROGRAM
FOR FURNITURE DESIGN.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.905
I DID MY HOMEWORK.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.255
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
MANUFACTURERS
COULD SAVE

14:25.255 --> 14:27.257
IF THEY HAD
VIRTUAL PROTOTYPES?

14:27.257 --> 14:28.476
WELL...

14:28.476 --> 14:30.086
YEAH, I GUESS.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.480
WHO IS BETTER QUALIFIED
THAN YOU AND ME

14:32.480 --> 14:34.134
TO CREATE THE PROGRAM?

14:34.134 --> 14:36.266
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT
OUR OWN THINK TANK
RIGHT HERE.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.399
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE COULD DO THAT?

14:38.399 --> 14:39.617
FOR REAL?

14:39.617 --> 14:41.228
I AM TELLING YOU,
CHUCK,

14:41.228 --> 14:42.577
WE ARE RETIRED,
SITTING ON A BEACH,

14:42.577 --> 14:47.190
SIPPING MAI-TAIS,
CHECKING OUR STOCKS
WITHIN 5 YEARS.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.583
LOOK AT THIS.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.585
SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE WOODGRAIN.

14:50.585 --> 14:51.891
WE CAN MAKE A TEMPLATE.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.893
SORT OF LIKE MIXING PAINTS.

14:58.158 --> 15:01.117
HOW FAR DID YOU SAY
WE WERE GOING?

15:01.117 --> 15:03.206
3 MILES.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

15:03.206 --> 15:06.079
SO, ELLIOT...

15:06.079 --> 15:08.472
I WAS THINKING
OF MAYBE, UH--

15:08.472 --> 15:10.083
REDOING MY BEDROOM.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.476
YOU MEAN LIKE PAINT
AND STUFF?

15:12.476 --> 15:14.478
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
MAYBE CARPET

15:14.478 --> 15:18.134
AND--WHAT
DO YOU CALL IT
FOR THE WINDOWS?

15:18.134 --> 15:19.875
THERE'S A WORD
FOR IT. WINDOW...

15:19.875 --> 15:21.050
TREATMENTS?

15:21.050 --> 15:23.879
RIGHT.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.837
TREATMENTS.
YOU KNEW THAT.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.274
YOU WOULDN'T, UH--

15:27.274 --> 15:31.234
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY IDEAS ABOUT THAT,
WOULD YOU?

15:31.234 --> 15:34.194
YEAH. THROW A SHEET
OVER THEM.

15:34.194 --> 15:38.241
AH. HEY, I HADN'T
THOUGHT OF THAT.

15:38.241 --> 15:41.244
HEY, YOU CATCH ANY
OF THAT SHARKS GAME
LAST NIGHT?

15:41.244 --> 15:43.855
NO, I WAS LISTENING
TO TURANDOT.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.292
WHO'S THAT?

15:45.292 --> 15:46.467
IT'S AN OPERA.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.773
OH.

15:48.773 --> 15:52.690
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU WERE INTO...

15:52.690 --> 15:53.691
OPERA?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.128
ARE YOU KIDDING?

15:55.128 --> 15:57.086
I HAD TO LISTEN
FOR THIS STUPID MUSIC CLASS

15:57.086 --> 15:59.175
THAT I HAVE TO TAKE.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.221
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
I HAD TO MISS THE GAME

16:01.221 --> 16:03.571
TO LISTEN TO A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE SCREAM
AT EACH OTHER.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.837
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN CATS?

16:08.837 --> 16:10.012
EXCUSE ME?

16:10.012 --> 16:12.058
CATS. YOU KNOW,
THE MUSICAL.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
SARAH DRAGGED ME
TO SEE IT LAST YEAR.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.235
HAVE YOU?

16:15.235 --> 16:16.801
EVER SEEN IT?

16:16.801 --> 16:18.064
I HATE MUSICALS.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.152
REALLY?

16:19.152 --> 16:21.154
YEAH, AND, UH, WHAT'S UP?

16:21.154 --> 16:22.982
YOU'RE ACTING KIND OF WACKO.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.465
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

16:28.465 --> 16:31.077
I'M JUST--

16:31.077 --> 16:32.774
I WAS JUST
MAKING CONVERSATION.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.476
THIS IS A PICTURE OF ME
AS MOTHER DEATH

16:39.476 --> 16:41.130
FROM THE VAMPIRE FESTIVAL,

16:41.130 --> 16:44.133
AND IT SHOULD DEFINITELY
GO INTO THE TIME CAPSULE,

16:44.133 --> 16:46.048
'CAUSE, WELL,
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA

16:46.048 --> 16:48.398
OF BURYING MYSELF
AND THEN RISING
FROM THE DEAD

16:48.398 --> 16:50.574
IN 25 YEARS.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.229
END OF THE WORLD,
THE GAME.

16:53.229 --> 16:57.190
MAYBE BY 2026,
WHEN WE OPEN UP
THE TIME CAPSULE,

16:57.190 --> 17:00.454
IT WON'T JUST BE
A GAME ANYMORE.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.152
I MADE THIS VIDEOTAPE
OF LIFE AT GRANT HIGH.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.154
WE CAN WATCH IT
AT OUR 25th CLASS REUNION,

17:05.154 --> 17:07.156
ASSUMING VHS IS STILL
A VIABLE FORMAT

17:07.156 --> 17:08.940
AND THE TAPE
HASN'T OXIDIZED, THAT IS.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.333
NOT A CLUE.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.249
CLAUDIA, EVERYONE
HAS TO CONTRIBUTE.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.904
YEAH, BUT THIS
WHOLE THING IS JUST...

17:15.904 --> 17:17.210
STUPID.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.342
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN
PUT IN THAT CAPSULE

17:19.342 --> 17:21.997
THAT SAYS WHAT LIFE
IS LIKE.

17:21.997 --> 17:25.348
I MEAN, WHO CARES
ABOUT COMIC BOOKS
OR CDs OR WHATEVER.

17:25.348 --> 17:28.482
THOSE THINGS DON'T
EVEN MATTER NOW.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.657
REALLY?

17:29.657 --> 17:30.919
OK.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.574
THEN WHAT DOES MATTER
TO YOU?

17:33.574 --> 17:35.967
LIKE I KNOW.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.013
HOW'S THIS FOR AN IDEA?

17:38.013 --> 17:40.146
WHY DON'T YOU
FIGURE IT OUT?

17:40.146 --> 17:41.103
ON PAPER.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.757
EXCUSE ME?

17:42.757 --> 17:45.325
I WANT YOU TO WRITE
A LETTER TO YOURSELF,

17:45.325 --> 17:48.545
AND I WANT YOU TO TELL
THAT 40-YEAR-OLD YOU

17:48.545 --> 17:51.244
WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE
AT GRANT IN 1998.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.290
I'M SORRY.
A LETTER?

17:54.290 --> 17:55.509
TO MYSELF?

17:55.509 --> 17:56.814
5 PAGES, TYPED,

17:56.814 --> 17:58.120
TOMORROW.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.863
HA HA HA!

18:01.863 --> 18:03.952
NO! NO.
I'M JUST SAYING

18:03.952 --> 18:05.954
THAT YOU LOOKED GREAT.
YOU SOUNDED GREAT.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.957
I WAS VERY PROUD
OF YOU. THAT'S ALL.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.959
OH, YEAH.
WELL, YOU WEREN'T
SO BAD YOURSELF.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.613
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE

18:12.613 --> 18:14.310
THAT'S GOING
TO HAVE THEM LINED UP
AROUND THE BLOCK, NOT ME.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.964
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.966
HELLO. WE'RE
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.968
YOU THINK I SHOULD PURSUE
A CAREER AT IT,

18:19.968 --> 18:21.317
BECOME LIKE A SPOKESPERSON
OR SOMETHING?

18:21.317 --> 18:24.320
WELL, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.539
WHATEVER, HUH?

18:25.539 --> 18:27.149
YOU MEAN LIKE ANYTHING?

18:27.149 --> 18:28.542
WELL, WITHIN REASON.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.760
CHARLIE?!

18:29.760 --> 18:32.198
WHAT?

18:32.198 --> 18:33.155
CLAUDIA?!

18:33.155 --> 18:34.461
OWEN?!

18:35.592 --> 18:37.203
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:37.203 --> 18:38.552
WHATEVER I WANT.

18:38.552 --> 18:39.553
MMM!

18:39.553 --> 18:41.120
OH!

18:43.818 --> 18:46.734
OUR FIRST JOB,
COMFORTABLE HOSPITAL CHAIRS.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.344
WE'D MAKE A KILLING.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.129
MR. QUASS?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.260
RIGHT HERE.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.740
I NEED YOUR SIGNATURE
ON SOME INSURANCE PAPERS.

18:52.740 --> 18:57.266
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MOVE THIS ALONG.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.747
OH, I SEE YOU'RE STARTING
YOUR FINAL 6 WEEKS.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.357
YOU GOT IT.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.837
DOC SAYS I'M
OUT OF THE WOODS,

19:02.837 --> 19:04.578
BUT, OF COURSE, THEY GOT
TO MILK 6 MORE WEEKS

19:04.578 --> 19:06.232
OF MEDICAL BILLS
OUT OF ME.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.276
HA HA HA!
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.670
YEAH, I BEAT THE ODDS.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.281
I'M THINKING MAYBE
I SHOULD GO TO VEGAS.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.327
WELL, MAKE A BET FOR ME.

19:14.327 --> 19:18.331
'CAUSE I TELL YOU,
CANCER--YOU THINK
YOU'RE A GONER,

19:18.331 --> 19:20.202
BUT MODERN MEDICINE,
IT'S AMAZING.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.987
75% RIGHT?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.208
THAT'S 3 OUT OF 4.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.862
I'M ONE OF THEM.

19:27.862 --> 19:31.953
I MEAN, HOW LUCKY
CAN YOU GET?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.698
HEY, 10 MINUTES
TO THE FIRST RESERVATION.

19:37.698 --> 19:38.960
PUT THE ROMANCE MIX ON,

19:38.960 --> 19:41.702
AND SOMEBODY HIT THE LIGHTS!

19:41.702 --> 19:42.877
HEY, BAILEY?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.095
HEY, MAN.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.488
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:45.488 --> 19:47.490
YOU MEETING SARAH HERE
OR SOMETHING?

19:47.490 --> 19:49.144
WHAT? OH, NO.
I JUST, UH--

19:49.144 --> 19:50.537
LISTEN, I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND

19:50.537 --> 19:53.104
ME DROPPING IN ON YOU
AT WORK LIKE THIS,

19:53.104 --> 19:54.497
BUT CAN WE TALK?

19:54.497 --> 19:56.978
UM, YEAH. YEAH. SURE.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.894
HERE.
COME ON OVER HERE.

20:01.591 --> 20:02.984
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:02.984 --> 20:04.942
WELL, IT'S
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

20:04.942 --> 20:06.596
YOU KNOW, JOGGING?

20:06.596 --> 20:09.599
WHAT? DID I
RUN YOU TOO HARD?

20:09.599 --> 20:10.818
NO.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.211
NO. JUST, UH...

20:12.211 --> 20:16.476
YOU WERE, LIKE, WEIRD
WITH ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.957
YEAH. I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.611
I WAS JUST--

20:21.611 --> 20:22.830
IT'S STUPID.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.049
NO. NO. DON'T APOLOGIZE,

20:25.049 --> 20:27.008
'CAUSE I JUST, UH...

20:27.008 --> 20:30.533
I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE
HINTING AROUND AT.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.752
OK?

20:31.752 --> 20:35.146
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

20:35.146 --> 20:37.845
THAT I AM, LIKE,
SO RELIEVED.

20:39.934 --> 20:40.978
RELIEVED?

20:40.978 --> 20:44.634
YEAH, 'CAUSE...

20:44.634 --> 20:46.593
I THINK, UH...

20:49.552 --> 20:51.902
I THINK MAYBE I AM, TOO.

20:54.209 --> 20:58.039
YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU ARE, TOO, WHAT?

20:59.562 --> 21:01.738
WELL, YOU KNOW.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.959
GAY, LIKE YOU.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.569
MAN!

21:06.569 --> 21:09.224
OK. I SAID IT.

21:09.224 --> 21:12.053
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE BEEN GREAT.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.663
BAY, THIS HAS BEEN--

21:13.663 --> 21:16.753
YOU'VE MADE THIS
SO MUCH EASIER FOR ME,

21:16.753 --> 21:19.713
AND, I MEAN, I THOUGHT
SARAH WAS GOING TO BE IT.

21:19.713 --> 21:22.193
YOU KNOW, PROVE TO ME
THAT I WASN'T.

21:22.193 --> 21:25.545
AND THEN--
THEN YOU CAME ALONG,

21:25.545 --> 21:29.113
AND IT JUST FELT--

21:29.113 --> 21:31.942
IT WAS DIFFERENT.
YOU KNOW?

21:31.942 --> 21:33.596
LIKE, I GOT THAT VIBE,

21:33.596 --> 21:37.557
AND IT JUST SEEMED RIGHT
OR SOMETHING.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.603
AND NOW, IT'S LIKE
I AM SURE.

21:40.603 --> 21:45.652
IN FACT, I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE SURE ABOUT ANYTHING
IN MY LIFE.

21:45.652 --> 21:49.743
THE WHOLE ANNIE THING
KIND OF THREW ME AT FIRST,

21:49.743 --> 21:51.701
BUT, DUH, YOU MUST FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT HER

21:51.701 --> 21:54.965
THAT I DO ABOUT SARAH,
SO I GET THAT.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.100
LOOK, ELLIOT...

22:01.363 --> 22:03.409
IT'S TOTALLY COOL
IF YOU'RE--

22:03.409 --> 22:05.454
[WHISPERS]
if you're gay.

22:05.454 --> 22:08.892
I--I HAVE NO
OPINION ABOUT THAT.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.808
UM, BUT...

22:11.808 --> 22:15.856
I THINK THAT MAYBE
YOU GOT THE WRONG--

22:15.856 --> 22:21.731
I--I KNOW THAT YOU
DEFINITELY GOT
THE WRONG IDEA

22:21.731 --> 22:23.080
THIS MORNING,

22:23.080 --> 22:25.735
BECAUSE...

22:25.735 --> 22:27.607
I'M NOT.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.217
I WAS JUST--

22:29.217 --> 22:34.483
I'M--I'M SORRY,
BUT I WAS JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUT IF YOU WERE.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.661
OH.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.969
OH, MAN.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.189
WELL...

22:47.322 --> 22:49.977
THEN MAYBE
WE SHOULD, UH...

22:51.674 --> 22:54.068
MAYBE I SHOULD...

22:55.722 --> 22:57.854
I'M GOING TO GO.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.646
OH, MY GOD.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.089
NO. I MEAN IT, BAILEY.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.091
I MEAN, ELLIOT'S
COMING OVER TONIGHT.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.484
I'M MAKING DINNER,

23:18.484 --> 23:19.702
AND TONIGHT HE IS MINE.
YOU KNOW?

23:19.702 --> 23:21.356
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.

23:21.356 --> 23:23.358
NO MORE WAITING,
AND I DON'T WANT
YOU 2 RUNNING OFF

23:23.358 --> 23:25.708
SO THAT YOU CAN
PUMP IRON OR JOG OR
WHATEVER THE HELL IT IS

23:25.708 --> 23:27.449
THAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU GET TOGETHER.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.930
DON'T WORRY.
ANNIE AND I ARE GOING
TO THE MOVIES, SO--

23:29.930 --> 23:32.933
WELL, GOOD, 'CAUSE
TONIGHT YOU CAN'T STEAL
MY BOYFRIEND.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.935
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.937
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.373
NO. IT'S NOT MY JOB.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.984
BAILEY, HER BOYFRIEND
IS--SHE SHOULD KNOW.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.333
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHE SHOULD,

23:42.333 --> 23:44.031
AND HE SHOULD TELL HER.

23:44.031 --> 23:47.208
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
THE ONE TO HURT HER
LIKE THAT.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.557
AND IF THIS
IS ON THE DOORKNOB,

23:48.557 --> 23:50.211
DO NOT ENTER. OK?

23:50.211 --> 23:53.214
'CAUSE, BAILEY,
I MADE UP MY MIND.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.824
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.176
YEAH...

23:59.176 --> 24:01.831
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,
SARAH, BUT ARE YOU SURE?

24:01.831 --> 24:03.485
YEAH, I'M SURE.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.227
GOD, BAILEY,
ELLIOT CALLED ME, OK?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.358
HE SAID THAT HE
HAD TO SEE ME,

24:07.358 --> 24:09.273
THAT IT WAS, LIKE,
REALLY IMPORTANT.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.188
WHY AM I EVEN
TELLING YOU THIS?

24:11.188 --> 24:13.495
I MEAN, IT'S SO
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.933
BAILEY, DO YOU HAVE TO
KEEP EVERYTHING THAT
YOU OWN ON THIS COUCH?

24:16.933 --> 24:18.326
BAILEY.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.807
WHAT? WHAT?
MAYBE HE'S
GONNA TELL HER.

24:20.807 --> 24:23.462
WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY
WHAT SHE THINKS SHE'S
IN FOR THIS EVENING.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.072
YEAH, WELL--WELL--

24:25.072 --> 24:26.682
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?

24:26.682 --> 24:28.075
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE WHISPERING?

24:28.075 --> 24:29.859
[SIGHS]

24:29.859 --> 24:32.906
NOTHING. NOTHING.
WE WERE JUST...

24:36.736 --> 24:38.912
LOOK...

24:38.912 --> 24:41.436
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL,
SARAH.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.656
I MEAN, HOW WELL
DO YOU REALLY KNOW THIS GUY?

24:43.656 --> 24:44.918
NO, NO, BAILEY.

24:44.918 --> 24:45.919
I AM NOT GONNA STAND HERE

24:45.919 --> 24:48.704
AND LISTEN TO SOME
SAFE SEX LECTURE, OK?

24:48.704 --> 24:50.401
NOBODY IS GONNA
SPOIL THIS FOR ME.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.058
WHAT?

24:58.932 --> 25:00.760
NOTHING.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.372
THEN DON'T FORGET.
I MEAN IT.

25:04.372 --> 25:07.114
OK, WE ARE LOOKING
AT 3 MONTHS

25:07.114 --> 25:07.984
TO DESIGN
A PROTOTYPE.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.420
THAT'S WITHOUT
ALL THE PLUG-INS,

25:09.420 --> 25:12.206
BUT ENOUGH FLASH
TO GET SOME SERIOUS
SEED MONEY.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.251
HEY, YOU DOZING OFF
ON ME?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.558
NO, I'M JUST LISTENING.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.951
AND WHILE WE'RE
INPUTTING

25:17.951 --> 25:19.692
ALL THE MANUFACTURING
SPECIFICATIONS,

25:19.692 --> 25:21.824
WE START CONTACTING
SOME OF THE BIGGER
SOFTWARE COMPANIES,

25:21.824 --> 25:24.000
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA GO
INDI-PROD, YOU KNOW?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.350
YEAH, PROBABLY NOT.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.091
WE WANT THIS
IN EVERY MAJOR
SOFTWARE CATALOG

25:28.091 --> 25:29.571
BY NEXT SPRING.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.573
THEN WE CAN KICK BACK
AND WATCH THE TIDAL WAVE
OF MONEY

25:31.573 --> 25:33.053
JUST COME RUSHING IN.

25:33.053 --> 25:37.013
BRRRRAAAAAA! HA HA.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.276
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU TIRED?

25:39.276 --> 25:40.669
BECAUSE WE CAN PARK THIS
TILL TOMORROW.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.628
NO, I'M NOT TIRED.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.978
OK, I'M JUST, UM...

25:44.978 --> 25:46.936
I'M JUST THINKING
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING,

25:46.936 --> 25:50.157
AND I'M LISTENING
TO YOU, AND...

25:50.157 --> 25:51.941
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS GONNA WORK...

25:51.941 --> 25:53.203
THIS WHOLE
SOFTWARE IDEA.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.944
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
OF COURSE IT'LL WORK.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.033
NO. I MEAN,
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE,

25:57.033 --> 25:58.818
AND WHO'S GONNA USE IT
ANYWAY?

25:58.818 --> 26:00.994
IT'S NOT LIKE
PEOPLE SIT AROUND
AND DESIGN FURNITURE.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.604
CHARLIE, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:02.604 --> 26:03.997
I PULLED THE FIGURES
OFF THE INTERNET.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.607
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK, OK?

26:05.607 --> 26:06.956
IT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.349
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:08.349 --> 26:10.960
YOU DESIGN FURNITURE
WITH A PENCIL

26:10.960 --> 26:11.961
AND A PIECE OF PAPER,

26:11.961 --> 26:13.223
AND YOU BUILD IT
WITH YOUR HANDS,

26:13.223 --> 26:17.097
NOT WITH SOME VIRTUAL
CYBER WHATEVER IT IS.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.315
JUST FORGET IT, KEVIN,
ALL RIGHT?

26:18.315 --> 26:19.273
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.188
CHARLIE, WHOA--

26:21.188 --> 26:23.146
I MEAN IT.
IT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA,

26:23.146 --> 26:24.017
AND I'M NOT DOING IT.

26:29.152 --> 26:33.635
WELL, I TOOK A LOOK
AT YOUR LITTLE "COMMERCIAL."

26:33.635 --> 26:36.551
GREAT. SO WHAT
DO YOU THINK'S
MORE IMPORTANT,

26:36.551 --> 26:37.987
THE RATING
OR THE SHARE?

26:37.987 --> 26:39.206
BECAUSE WE
DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER TO RUN IT

26:39.206 --> 26:40.207
DURING
THE KUNG FU
FESTIVAL--

26:40.207 --> 26:41.121
OR CARTOON CARNIVALS.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.951
THAT'S CUTE.
JUST TELL HIM HE WINS.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.996
EXCUSE ME?

26:46.996 --> 26:49.085
'CAUSE THIS IS
THE FUNNIEST DAMN THING

26:49.085 --> 26:50.304
I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.566
FUNNY?

26:51.566 --> 26:52.959
COME ON.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.177
MANNY ARBOWITZ
PUT YOU UP TO THIS,
RIGHT?

26:54.177 --> 26:55.570
WHO?

26:55.570 --> 26:57.616
I MEAN,
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.009
NO.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.272
YOU SERIOUSLY WANT ME
TO AIR THIS?

27:02.272 --> 27:04.013
OF COURSE WE DO.

27:04.013 --> 27:07.016
I'M SORRY, BUT...

27:07.016 --> 27:09.105
THIS TAPE....

27:09.105 --> 27:10.150
THE PICTURE'S
FULL OF SNOW.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.108
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL.

27:12.108 --> 27:15.416
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT
PUBLIC ACCESS HERE.

27:15.416 --> 27:16.983
IT'S FUNNY AS HELL WITH
THE STAMMERING, BUT--

27:16.983 --> 27:19.681
WAIT A MINUTE.
I PAID 2 GRAND
FOR THIS THING.

27:19.681 --> 27:20.769
YOU HAVE TO RUN IT.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.075
2 GRAND?

27:22.075 --> 27:24.077
YOU CAN'T DO
A DECENT COMMERCIAL
FOR 2 GRAND.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.819
I'M SORRY, BUT...

27:28.559 --> 27:31.650
CAN I STILL KEEP
A COPY, PLEASE?

27:31.650 --> 27:34.565
IT'S JUST, WE GET
A KICK OUT OF IT
AROUND HERE.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.137
HEY.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.492
[SIGHS]

27:48.492 --> 27:51.147
YOU OK?

27:51.147 --> 27:52.061
PEACHY.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.241
IT'S OK IF I TURN
ON A LIGHT?

28:04.117 --> 28:07.729
OH, MAN. OK...

28:12.342 --> 28:14.518
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:14.518 --> 28:18.435
HE JUST--[SOB]--
HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.220
HE CAME OVER, AND--

28:20.220 --> 28:23.832
AND HE WAS ACTING
ALL WEIRD,

28:23.832 --> 28:28.315
AND THEN
HE STARTED CRYING
AND APOLOGIZING,

28:28.315 --> 28:30.360
AND HE WASN'T MAKING
ANY SENSE, BAILEY,

28:30.360 --> 28:32.406
SO JUST I ASKED HIM
TO JUST SIT DOWN

28:32.406 --> 28:34.582
AND TALK, AND...

28:34.582 --> 28:35.670
HE COULDN'T STOP CRYING,

28:35.670 --> 28:37.803
SO HE RAN OUT.

28:37.803 --> 28:41.545
GOD, BAILEY, WHAT
IS WRONG WITH ME,

28:41.545 --> 28:42.546
NOTHING.

28:42.546 --> 28:45.593
NOTHING. THAT'S NOT...

28:45.593 --> 28:47.987
I MEAN, HE TOLD YOU WHY,
RIGHT?

28:47.987 --> 28:50.250
NO. NO, HE DIDN'T.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.383
HE JUST SAID
THAT THIS WASN'T RIGHT

28:53.383 --> 28:54.558
AND THAT IT WAS
HIS PROBLEM,

28:54.558 --> 28:56.952
AND THAT'S IT.

28:56.952 --> 28:57.953
SO HE NEVER TOLD YOU?

28:57.953 --> 28:59.476
TOLD ME WHAT?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.916
WAIT A MINUTE.

29:03.916 --> 29:08.790
BAILEY--BAILEY,
YOU GUYS DIDN'T--

29:08.790 --> 29:10.313
OH.

29:10.313 --> 29:15.014
OH, WELL,
THAT'S HUMILIATING
THAT YOU GUYS--

29:15.014 --> 29:19.453
BAILEY, DID HE
TELL YOU WHY HE WAS
GONNA DUMP ME?

29:19.453 --> 29:22.238
BECAUSE IF HE DID,
BAILEY, YOU OWE ME
THAT, OK?

29:22.238 --> 29:24.023
YOU OWE ME
THE TRUTH.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.982
I MEAN, IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I DID, RIGHT?

29:26.982 --> 29:29.245
OR THE FACT THAT HE
FINDS ME REPULSIVE?

29:29.245 --> 29:30.290
NO.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.596
WHAT IS IT, BAILEY?
TELL ME.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.091
Claudia: HEY.

29:51.311 --> 29:52.486
HEY.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.096
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

29:54.096 --> 29:57.708
THERE'S ACTUALLY
SOME SORT OF COOL NEWS
AROUND HERE FOR A CHANGE.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.799
WHAT IS IT?

30:00.799 --> 30:03.932
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
THAT ESSAY I HAD
TO WRITE?

30:03.932 --> 30:05.716
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A LETTER TO CLASS

30:05.716 --> 30:09.546
FOR WHEN WE'RE ALL
LIKE 40 YEARS OLD,

30:09.546 --> 30:10.939
BUT MRS. RYERSON
LIKED IT SO MUCH

30:10.939 --> 30:14.073
THAT IT'S GOING
IN THE TIME CAPSULE.

30:14.073 --> 30:17.163
REALLY? THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT, CLAUD.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.294
BUT, CHARLIE,
THAT'S NOTHING.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.514
SHE SAID I DID SUCH
A GREAT JOB ON IT.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.951
IT'S...IT'S CALLED
HERE AND NOW.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.605
SHE WANTS ME TO READ IT
DURING THE ASSEMBLY

30:24.605 --> 30:25.824
WHILE WE BURY
THE TIME CAPSULE,

30:25.824 --> 30:27.956
AND THEN SHE WANTS ME
TO READ IT AGAIN--

30:27.956 --> 30:30.132
AND GET THIS--IN 2026

30:30.132 --> 30:34.876
AT MY CLASS OF 25th
REUNION.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.791
IT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH?

30:39.750 --> 30:42.231
ANYWAY, I WAS, UM...

30:42.231 --> 30:44.668
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU'D COME
TO THE ASSEMBLY.

30:44.668 --> 30:49.108
IT'D BE REALLY GREAT
IF YOU WERE THERE
WHEN I READ IT.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.500
CLAUDIA--

30:50.500 --> 30:52.763
THINK ABOUT IT.
REALLY, CHARLIE.
THINK ABOUT THAT.

30:52.763 --> 30:55.157
THIS IS SO WEIRD.
I'LL BE...

30:55.157 --> 30:56.985
I'LL BE 42
AT THE REUNION.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.031
I MIGHT EVEN BE MARRIED,

30:59.031 --> 31:00.859
MIGHT EVEN
HAVE SOME KIDS.
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

31:00.859 --> 31:03.905
IT'S--MAN, ISN'T THAT--

31:03.905 --> 31:05.341
ISN'T THAT WEIRD
TO THINK ABOUT?

31:07.300 --> 31:10.216
GOD, CLAUDIA...

31:10.216 --> 31:11.870
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

31:13.523 --> 31:15.482
WHAT?

31:15.482 --> 31:17.266
WHAT? CHARLIE, I WAS
JUST SAYING THAT--

31:17.266 --> 31:19.094
I KNOW WHAT YOU
WERE SAYING, ALL RIGHT?

31:19.094 --> 31:21.314
AND HOW THE HELL
COULD YOU BE SO INSENSITIVE?

31:23.272 --> 31:25.144
WELL, WHAT DID I SAY,
CHARLIE?

31:25.144 --> 31:27.973
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE JUST YAMMERING ON

31:27.973 --> 31:29.713
ABOUT BEING 40
AND ABOUT HOW ALL THIS STUFF

31:29.713 --> 31:30.976
THAT YOU HAVE TO
LOOK FORWARD TO

31:30.976 --> 31:32.673
AND ALL THESE PLANS
THAT YOU'RE MAKING.

31:32.673 --> 31:35.981
NO, NO, NO, CHARLIE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.548
I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE, OK?

31:50.299 --> 31:51.387
HOW'D IT GO?

31:53.955 --> 31:56.523
SAME THING
AT EVERY STATION.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.568
BASICALLY, THEY ALL
THINK IT SUCKS.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.050
OH.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.313
YEAH, WELL,
WHY SHOULD THAT COME

32:04.313 --> 32:06.098
AS ANY BIG SHOCK, HUH?

32:06.098 --> 32:09.014
NOTHING I DO
IS GOOD ENOUGH.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.450
I'M NEVER GOING TO
BE ABLE TO COMPETE.

32:10.450 --> 32:14.149
I'M JUST, WHAT,
SMALL POTATOES
OR SOMETHING.

32:14.149 --> 32:17.109
I'M SORRY. I KNOW IT'S HARD.

32:17.109 --> 32:21.243
YEAH, WELL, I'VE GOTTA
COME UP WITH AN IDEA.

32:21.243 --> 32:24.203
JUST ONE GOOD IDEA.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.248
IF I'M STILL HAVING
THIS REOPENING THING,

32:26.248 --> 32:28.729
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET PEOPLE IN THERE

32:28.729 --> 32:30.905
IF I HAVE TO GO
UP THE STREET AND STEAL
THE CUSTOMERS FROM THEM.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.647
I'M NOT GIVING UP.
I CAN DO THIS.
I KNOW I CAN MAKE THIS WORK!

32:33.647 --> 32:38.826
GRIFFIN, WE JUST LOST
$2,000 ON THAT COMMERCIAL.

32:38.826 --> 32:43.787
THAT'S $2,000 THAT WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO PAY BACK,
PLUS INTEREST,

32:43.787 --> 32:46.138
AND THAT'S JUST MORE MONEY
THAT WE OWE.

32:46.138 --> 32:49.010
I'LL MAKE IT BACK,
ALL RIGHT? I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

32:49.010 --> 32:52.187
GOD, GRIFFIN, DON'T YOU...

32:52.187 --> 32:53.710
EVERY TIME
WE GET A BANK STATEMENT,

32:53.710 --> 32:55.799
EVERY 4 STUPID WEEKS,

32:55.799 --> 32:57.976
IT'S LIKE,
"WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?
WHERE DID IT ALL GO?"

32:57.976 --> 32:59.673
AND IT'S KILLING US.

32:59.673 --> 33:03.024
IT'S KILLING US, AND...

33:05.461 --> 33:08.160
YOU GOT TO GET RID
OF IT, GRIFFIN.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.117
YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID
OF THE SHOP.

33:09.117 --> 33:13.165
WHAT? NO, NO.
I CAN SAVE IT, JULIA.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.122
YOU JUST GOTTA
BELIEVE IN ME.

33:14.122 --> 33:18.257
THAT IS NOT--
STOP DOING THAT, GRIFFIN.

33:18.257 --> 33:20.346
STOP MAKING THIS
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
I BELIEVE IN YOU,

33:20.346 --> 33:23.218
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR.
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT...

33:23.218 --> 33:25.046
LOOK AT WHAT
IT'S DOING TO US.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.875
WE'RE BROKE,
WE'RE LIVING HAND-TO-MOUTH,

33:27.875 --> 33:30.791
WE'RE ARGUING ALL THE TIME,
AND LOOK AT OUR LIFE.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.534
GRIFFIN,
YOU GOT TO LET IT GO.

33:37.841 --> 33:38.929
NO, I WON'T.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.024
WELL, THEN, UH...

33:46.024 --> 33:48.765
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT, UM...

33:48.765 --> 33:51.072
I'M NOT DOING THIS ANYMORE.

33:51.072 --> 33:54.075
I'M NOT GONNA KEEP
WORKING CRUMMY JOBS
SO THAT YOU CAN...

33:57.078 --> 33:57.992
I'M DONE.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.892
HOW COULD YOU?!
SARAH!

34:28.892 --> 34:30.590
WHAT WAS ALL THAT, HUH?

34:30.590 --> 34:33.593
WITH THE MAKING OUT
AND THE "I'M A VIRGIN, TOO,"

34:33.593 --> 34:35.116
THE CHOCOLATE SHAVINGS
IN MY COFFEE

34:35.116 --> 34:38.293
AND THE "YOU SMELL
LIKE MY CHILDHOOD" CRAP?!

34:38.293 --> 34:40.295
I MEAN, WHAT WAS THAT, HUH?
JUST SOME KIND OF BIG ACT?

34:40.295 --> 34:41.949
DID BAILEY--

34:41.949 --> 34:44.212
YEAH, HE DID,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE

34:44.212 --> 34:46.084
BECAUSE YOU, YOU SHOULD
HAVE TOLD ME, ELLIOT.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.302
I MEAN, GOD, THAT'S BASIC.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.043
SARAH, WAIT, PLEASE.

34:49.043 --> 34:52.568
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE EVERYTHING
OUT AT ONCE.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.179
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:54.179 --> 34:56.529
YOU MADE ME FEEL
LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.834
YOU MADE ME FEEL HORRIBLE,

34:57.834 --> 34:59.532
AND THE WHOLE TIME,
YOU WERE JUST LYING TO ME.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.316
NO.

35:01.316 --> 35:05.538
OK, YES, BUT IT'S
NOT THAT SIMPLE,

35:05.538 --> 35:08.889
BECAUSE I JUST...

35:08.889 --> 35:11.152
I WASN'T SURE.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.371
I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO BE TRUE,

35:12.371 --> 35:14.764
AND WHEN I MET YOU,

35:14.764 --> 35:16.201
AND WHEN I REALIZED
HOW I FELT ABOUT YOU,

35:16.201 --> 35:20.030
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
LIKE MY SALVATION
OR SOMETHING.

35:20.030 --> 35:22.207
I THOUGHT...

35:22.207 --> 35:24.513
I THOUGHT, IF I CAN
LOVE THIS WOMAN,

35:24.513 --> 35:28.430
THEN IT'LL MAKE IT
ALL GO AWAY.

35:28.430 --> 35:31.129
YOU MADE A PASS
AT MY EX-BOYFRIEND.

35:34.915 --> 35:40.094
GOD. GOD, COULD SOMEBODY
JUST PLEASE TELL ME WHY
THINGS WORKS OUT THIS WAY?

35:40.094 --> 35:42.227
I FINALLY MEET THIS GUY.

35:42.227 --> 35:46.274
GOD, ELLIOT,
I FINALLY MEET YOU,

35:46.274 --> 35:48.972
AND YOU'RE SMART
AND SENSITIVE.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.191
YOU HAVE GREAT TASTE.

35:50.191 --> 35:54.239
YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
WHO DINAH WASHINGTON IS,
AND...

35:54.239 --> 35:57.198
OK...

35:57.198 --> 35:58.939
WELL, OK, MAYBE
I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING,

35:58.939 --> 36:00.897
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT FAIR, ELLIOT.

36:00.897 --> 36:04.249
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.641
IT'S NOT FAIR.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.827
WAIT.

36:17.827 --> 36:21.614
WAIT, NO. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HANG ON. ARE YOU SURE?

36:21.614 --> 36:23.442
[GROANS]

36:23.442 --> 36:25.357
NO. I MEAN, HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GAY?

36:25.357 --> 36:27.315
THAT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN
TO A PERSON OVERNIGHT.

36:27.315 --> 36:29.709
I JUST KNOW, OK?

36:29.709 --> 36:32.842
I MEAN, GOD,
IT DOESN'T EXACTLY TAKE
A GENIUS TO FIGURE IT OUT.

36:32.842 --> 36:36.063
YES, BUT, BAILEY,
I MEAN, YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO--

36:36.063 --> 36:39.936
COULD WE NOT TALK
ABOUT THAT?

36:41.286 --> 36:42.287
WOW.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.334
WHEW. HA.

36:46.334 --> 36:49.076
I JUST DON'T GET MEN,
LIKE, AT ALL.

36:50.425 --> 36:53.167
YEAH...

36:53.167 --> 36:55.169
WELL...

36:55.169 --> 36:57.302
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

37:11.403 --> 37:14.232
[SIGHS]

37:14.232 --> 37:17.060
IT'S THE BUSINESS, GRIFFIN.
IT'S NOT YOU.

37:17.060 --> 37:17.931
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

37:19.889 --> 37:23.110
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE
COULD YOU HAVE DONE?

37:23.110 --> 37:24.851
IT'S SO NOT YOUR FAULT.

37:27.332 --> 37:30.160
I HAD $100,000,

37:30.160 --> 37:32.728
AND NOW I DON'T.

37:32.728 --> 37:33.990
HOW'S THAT
NOT MY FAULT.

37:39.561 --> 37:40.910
[SIGHS]

37:50.485 --> 37:52.139
HEY.

37:52.139 --> 37:55.229
HEY.
WEEKLY GOT WET.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.144
AH.

37:57.144 --> 38:00.321
DID YOU EVER
READ THE PERSONALS?

38:00.321 --> 38:01.583
EXCUSE ME?

38:01.583 --> 38:04.847
YOU KNOW, RIGHT AFTER
THE PHONE SEX ADS.

38:04.847 --> 38:07.023
SOME REALLY NICE PEOPLE.

38:07.023 --> 38:09.374
I THINK IF MAYBE
I RAN AN AD,

38:09.374 --> 38:10.592
THEN THAT WOULD MEAN
THAT THERE WERE OTHER
NICE PEOPLE

38:10.592 --> 38:11.463
OUT THERE, TOO, RIGHT?

38:16.076 --> 38:17.686
I'M GONNA DIE A VIRGIN.

38:17.686 --> 38:18.687
SARAH--

38:18.687 --> 38:19.819
NO, I MEAN IT.

38:19.819 --> 38:22.300
IT'S JUST NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN FOR ME.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.301
SURE IT IS.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.347
OK, OK, LOOK...

38:26.347 --> 38:29.263
I KNOW THAT THIS
HAS TO BE...

38:29.263 --> 38:33.311
WELL, WEIRD,
FRANKLY, BUT...

38:33.311 --> 38:36.139
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S
A LITTLE EARLY IN THE GAME
TO BE GIVING UP?

38:41.797 --> 38:42.711
HEY...

38:47.107 --> 38:48.413
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

38:48.413 --> 38:51.154
LET'S JUST GO SEE
SOME STUPID MOVIE

38:51.154 --> 38:52.895
AND LAUGH
OUR ASSES OFF.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.246
LOOK AT
ALL THESE MOVIES.

38:56.246 --> 38:59.989
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
WE SAW A MOVIE TOGETHER?

38:59.989 --> 39:02.122
THE NIGHT BEFORE
YOU TOLD ME YOU
SLEPT WITH CALLIE.

39:06.605 --> 39:07.475
THAT LONG?

39:09.390 --> 39:10.304
WOW.

39:11.653 --> 39:12.785
UM...

39:12.785 --> 39:14.613
LOOK, BAILEY,
IT'S REALLY SWEET.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.616
IT'S VERY SWEET
THAT YOU WANT
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME,

39:17.616 --> 39:20.575
BUT I KIND OF
ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

39:20.575 --> 39:23.230
ELLIOT AND I ARE
GOING TO SEE OLIVER!

39:23.230 --> 39:26.102
WELL, YOU KNOW,

39:26.102 --> 39:28.714
JUST BECAUSE HE'S GAY
DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T
HAVE THINGS IN COMMON.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.979
ELLIOT SAID
HE HATES MUSICALS.

39:32.979 --> 39:34.023
GUESS WHAT.

39:34.023 --> 39:35.677
HE LIED.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.462
HMM.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.941
HMM.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.128
SORRY. UM...

39:52.128 --> 39:54.392
CLAUDIA SAID IT WAS OK.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.002
YEAH, SURE. I DIDN'T...

40:04.140 --> 40:08.231
UH, YOU GOTTA TELL
ME WHY, CHARLIE.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.146
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

40:10.146 --> 40:12.061
BECAUSE THIS
COULD BE GREAT.

40:12.061 --> 40:13.062
IT COULD GIVE
YOU SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO,

40:13.062 --> 40:14.760
TO HOLD ONTO.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.065
NO.

40:16.065 --> 40:19.591
YOU SEE, IT'S NOT...

40:19.591 --> 40:23.116
YOU DON'T GET IT,
KEVIN. I...

40:23.116 --> 40:26.162
IT'S JUST...

40:26.162 --> 40:27.555
YOU'RE MAKING THESE PLANS,

40:27.555 --> 40:29.209
ARE YOU'RE LAYING OUT
THE FUTURE,

40:29.209 --> 40:31.907
AND YOU CAN AFFORD
TO DO THAT NOW,

40:31.907 --> 40:34.910
AND THAT'S GREAT
FOR YOU. IT IS.

40:34.910 --> 40:37.870
BUT I CAN'T.

40:37.870 --> 40:40.786
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT YOU'RE GIVING UP?

40:40.786 --> 40:42.614
NO. I'M JUST SAYING THAT...

40:45.965 --> 40:49.664
THAT--THAT THING
THAT WE HAD IN COMMON,

40:49.664 --> 40:53.320
THE SICKNESS
AND THE TREATMENTS,
THAT'S...

40:53.320 --> 40:54.756
THAT'S ALL GONE NOW,
AND...

40:57.280 --> 41:00.066
AND WHAT, CHARLIE? WHAT?

41:02.111 --> 41:04.331
YOU'RE CURED.

41:04.331 --> 41:06.246
YOU'RE CURED,
AND THAT'S AMAZING,

41:06.246 --> 41:08.074
AND THE TRUTH IS,

41:08.074 --> 41:09.162
IT MAKES IT EASIER
FOR YOU NOW,

41:09.162 --> 41:12.339
BUT FOR ME, IT JUST...

41:12.339 --> 41:14.384
I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY.

41:14.384 --> 41:16.865
I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY
AND UNFAIR, BUT...

41:19.868 --> 41:22.654
YOU'RE ONE
OF THE 3 OUT OF 4.

41:22.654 --> 41:23.916
YOU GOT WELL.

41:26.658 --> 41:30.226
AND I CAN'T HELP IT.
I JUST...

41:33.273 --> 41:38.060
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I FEEL
LIKE MY CHANCES GOT WORSE.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.150
AND I WANT TO BE BIGGER
THAN THIS. I SWEAR I DO.

41:41.150 --> 41:42.021
BUT IT JUST...

41:45.372 --> 41:47.592
I CAN'T BE AROUND YOU
ANYMORE, MAN.

41:49.681 --> 41:52.510
'CAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,
ALL I KEEP THINKING IS...

41:56.949 --> 41:59.038
YOU TOOK MY PLACE, MAN.

42:01.127 --> 42:03.738
YOU TOOK MY PLACE.

42:09.744 --> 42:14.270
ALL RIGHT. NOW I'D LIKE
CLAUDIA SALINGER TO COME UP
AND READ HER ESSAY.

42:14.270 --> 42:15.228
CLAUDIA.

42:18.274 --> 42:19.188
CLAUDIA?

42:21.190 --> 42:24.063
I THOUGHT SHE WAS--

42:24.063 --> 42:26.195
WELL, I'LL READ IT FOR HER.

42:30.983 --> 42:35.596
"TO THE CLASS OF 2001
IN THE YEAR 2026

42:35.596 --> 42:39.861
"FROM THE CLASS OF 2001
IN THE YEAR 1998,

42:39.861 --> 42:42.864
"HI. HOW'S IT GOING?

42:42.864 --> 42:46.520
"I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE
TIME CAPSULE ASSIGNMENT
WAS KIND OF LAME

42:46.520 --> 42:50.219
UNTIL I ACTUALLY STARTED
THINKING ABOUT IT..."

42:50.219 --> 42:54.615
Claudia: "AND THAT'S
WHEN I REALIZED SOMETHING.

42:54.615 --> 42:57.226
"IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT WE PUT IN HERE

42:57.226 --> 43:01.143
"BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER
STUFF THAT WAS IMPORTANT
6 MONTHS AGO,

43:01.143 --> 43:03.711
"LET ALONE 25 YEARS.

43:03.711 --> 43:08.281
"I MEAN, MAN, I CAN'T WRAP
MY BRAIN AROUND 25 YEARS

43:08.281 --> 43:12.111
"'CAUSE I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
AROUND THAT LONG YET, SO...

43:12.111 --> 43:15.593
"IT SEEMS TO ME
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS,

43:15.593 --> 43:19.248
"THE ONLY THING
THAT'S EVEN--
THAT'S EVEN REAL,

43:19.248 --> 43:20.859
"IS THE HERE AND NOW.

43:20.859 --> 43:24.514
"AND SOME STUFF
IS IMPORTANT,

43:24.514 --> 43:26.299
AND SOME STUFF ISN'T..."

43:26.299 --> 43:27.430
OH, GOD.

43:27.430 --> 43:28.910
"AND I GUESS TIME
IS THE ONLY THING

43:28.910 --> 43:30.433
THAT CAN SORT OUT
WHICH IS WHICH."

43:32.479 --> 43:34.263
OW.

43:34.263 --> 43:37.049
"AND THAT JUST MEANS
THE MORE WE LIVE
IN THE PRESENT,

43:37.049 --> 43:39.181
"THE MORE WE STORE UP
ALL THE MEMORIES,

43:39.181 --> 43:40.748
"GOOD AND BAD.

43:40.748 --> 43:42.184
"THE MORE WE HAVE
TO HOLD ONTO

43:42.184 --> 43:45.144
ONCE PEOPLE, PLACES,
AND THINGS ARE GONE."

43:47.450 --> 43:49.539
"'CAUSE, BELIEVE ME,
I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE

43:49.539 --> 43:53.021
"WHEN I SAY
THINGS CAN CHANGE FOREVER

43:53.021 --> 43:55.545
WITH, LIKE, NO WARNING."

43:55.545 --> 43:59.288
"SO NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE SOMETHING

43:59.288 --> 44:03.336
"OR NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU TAKE IT FOR GRANTED,

44:03.336 --> 44:04.729
NOTHING LASTS FOREVER."

44:08.123 --> 44:10.778
"SO FOR NOW...

44:10.778 --> 44:13.476
"ALL WE CAN DO IS HANG ON

44:13.476 --> 44:17.089
"AND WAIT AND SEE
AND HOPE...

44:17.089 --> 44:18.568
FOR THE FUTURE."
