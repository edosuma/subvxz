Mum, you did it!

25:29.094 --> 25:30.595
They were going to kill us.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.998
I had to do it.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.133
What did you do?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.969
On their ship,
all they did was

25:38.036 --> 25:41.273
stuff their faces
with Rakweed.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.341
I knew their stomachs
would still be full of it.

25:43.408 --> 25:46.945
<i>The destruction</i>
<i>of the undigested Rakweed</i>
<i>created methane gas.</i>

25:47.012 --> 25:48.980
<i>It could not be contained.</i>

25:49.047 --> 25:51.783
So they farted themselves
to death?

25:51.850 --> 25:53.451
<i>In a nutshell, Master Clyde.</i>

25:54.619 --> 25:56.454
But this isn't how
it should end.

25:56.521 --> 25:58.957
There should've been
another way.

25:59.157 --> 26:00.558
A better way.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.062
You're amazing, Sarah Jane.

26:09.701 --> 26:13.505
Which is more than
can be said for people
who cheat at tests.

26:14.806 --> 26:16.107
But who's ever gonna
want to know

26:16.174 --> 26:18.610
about the life cycle
of a plant?

26:18.677 --> 26:19.678
(CLEARS THROAT)

26:21.613 --> 26:23.548
Fair enough.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.550
Now, fetch yourself a mop,

26:25.617 --> 26:27.953
in the kitchen,
and clean up this mess!

26:28.019 --> 26:28.920
(LAUGHING)

26:35.160 --> 26:38.463
SARAH JANE: <i>For once,</i>
<i>I truly hoped we'd</i>
<i>found a friend out there,</i>

26:38.530 --> 26:40.699
<i>someone Earth could trust,</i>

26:40.765 --> 26:42.767
<i>a way for us all</i>
<i>to move forward,</i>

26:42.834 --> 26:45.103
<i>humans and aliens together.</i>

26:46.237 --> 26:48.506
<i>I was wrong, this time.</i>

26:48.573 --> 26:50.408
One clean attic!

26:50.475 --> 26:52.844
<i>But it doesn't mean our next</i>
<i>visitors will be the same.</i>

26:54.012 --> 26:55.914
You've cremated our picnic.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.355
<i>There are friends out there,</i>
<i>too.</i>

27:03.421 --> 27:06.391
<i>Friends who really</i>
<i>will want to help us.</i>

27:06.458 --> 27:08.026
<i>And as we all know,</i>

27:08.093 --> 27:11.196
<i>there's nothing more important</i>
<i>than friendship.</i>

27:13.965 --> 27:19.237
<i>And then, one day,</i>
<i>with a little luck</i>
<i>and a lot of hard work,</i>

27:19.304 --> 27:23.441
<i>Earth could be</i>
<i>a shining example</i>
<i>to the entire Universe.</i>
