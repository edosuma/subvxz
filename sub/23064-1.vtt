This is Clara
Forester for ABC4 News.

02:56.842 --> 02:58.674
And we're now mere moments away

02:58.676 --> 03:01.644
from the historic worldwide
release of "Crashing Tide,"

03:01.646 --> 03:05.948
the third installment of the wildly
popular Siren saga from Sally Carmichael.

03:05.950 --> 03:09.852
Today, the young-adult series that
chronicles an epic love story

03:09.854 --> 03:11.787
between a young woman
and a merman

03:11.789 --> 03:15.024
has sold over
90 million copies worldwide,

03:15.026 --> 03:18.328
and this installment is
expected to put that number

03:18.330 --> 03:20.864
well over 100
in a matter of days.

03:20.866 --> 03:24.368
Once again, the response
from critics has been brutal.

03:24.370 --> 03:28.471
The New York Times said Crashing
Tide was, at best, juvenile,

03:28.473 --> 03:30.806
at worst, the very worst.

03:30.808 --> 03:34.945
Meanwhile, Sally Carmichael, the
series' notoriously private author,

03:34.947 --> 03:37.580
hasn't responded
to any criticism,

03:37.582 --> 03:40.917
as her identity remains
clouded in mystery.

03:40.919 --> 03:45.388
Rumored to be a Mormon wife and
mother living right here in Utah,

03:45.390 --> 03:48.892
the elusive writer has never
granted a single interview

03:48.894 --> 03:51.595
or made any kind of
public appearance.

03:51.597 --> 03:54.464
- Andie, hurry.
- Sorry, Mom.

03:54.466 --> 03:56.733
Well, with the release
of this new novel

03:56.735 --> 03:59.502
and the Siren movie
adaptation in the works,

03:59.504 --> 04:03.607
there appears to be no end
to Sally Carmichael in sight.

04:03.609 --> 04:07.511
We love you,
Sally Carmichael!

04:10.883 --> 04:12.749
We need to kill
Sally Carmichael.

04:12.751 --> 04:14.650
Have you seen
the first day's numbers? Hmm?

04:14.652 --> 04:17.620
2.5 million units in one day?

04:17.622 --> 04:19.089
You don't kill an author
with those numbers.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.591
Okay. But think of the
publicity if we kill her.

04:21.593 --> 04:22.825
How many books
would that sell? Huh?

04:22.827 --> 04:24.860
You know, that's
actually interesting.

04:24.862 --> 04:26.195
Okay. Okay.

04:26.197 --> 04:29.031
So we kill her after the seventh
book once your contract is up.

04:29.033 --> 04:32.101
No. I cannot write
four more Merman books.

04:32.103 --> 04:33.570
- I cannot.
- Okay.

04:33.572 --> 04:35.438
- I do not have it in me.
- Okay. Well, I'm sorry.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.673
But a contract is a contract.
There's nothing we can do about it.

04:37.675 --> 04:39.843
You're my publishers.
It is your contract.

04:39.845 --> 04:41.314
You can do whatever
you want with it.

04:42.747 --> 04:44.081
Just an expression.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.048
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

04:46.050 --> 04:49.385
I thought the whole idea
of inventing Sally Carmichael

04:49.387 --> 04:51.721
was so that you could write
whatever you want under your name.

04:51.723 --> 04:54.524
Yes. But I've been writing
as Sally for so long,

04:54.526 --> 04:57.694
I'm having a really hard time
writing anything else.

04:57.696 --> 05:01.697
Please, please kill Sally

05:01.699 --> 05:05.067
before she sucks away
what is left of my soul.

05:05.069 --> 05:09.072
See, that right there, that flair
for the dramatic, it works.

05:09.074 --> 05:12.709
Look, we didn't come here to talk
about killing Sally Carmichael, okay?

05:12.711 --> 05:14.614
Look at me. We came...

05:15.713 --> 05:19.548
to talk about
Perry Quinn, ah!

05:19.550 --> 05:21.050
I-I don't understand.
What about Perry Quinn?

05:22.588 --> 05:24.590
He's interested in the movie.

05:27.692 --> 05:30.060
Perry Quinn is interested
in being the Merman?

05:30.062 --> 05:32.796
- I know.
- He's at least ten years too old.

05:32.798 --> 05:34.531
- That's ridiculous.
- It's Hollywood.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.433
Oh. Oh, that's ridiculous?

05:36.435 --> 05:39.635
How about a little movie based on the
Six Flags ride about the Cavemen?

05:39.637 --> 05:42.671
Uh-huh. And how about
three sequels and $3 billion!

05:42.673 --> 05:44.140
How's that for
ridiculous? Huh?

05:44.142 --> 05:46.009
Yeah. Yeah. That's ridiculous.

05:46.011 --> 05:47.447
Think before you speak.

05:48.713 --> 05:50.949
Just one thing.
Perry wants to meet Sally.

05:52.817 --> 05:54.151
There is no Sally.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.553
He knows that,
and he's excited

05:56.555 --> 06:00.890
to meet the visionary who
created this entire phenomenon.

06:00.892 --> 06:04.161
No. No way.

06:04.163 --> 06:07.964
- -Okay. Well, of course
we can't force you to do it.

06:07.966 --> 06:09.933
But we can sue you
if you don't.

06:09.935 --> 06:11.901
That's right. We can sue.

06:11.903 --> 06:13.870
What are you talking about?
You can't sue me.

06:13.872 --> 06:15.171
That's not part
of my contract,

06:15.173 --> 06:16.740
and you can't tell anyone
who I am.

06:16.742 --> 06:17.973
Well, we're not going to.

06:17.975 --> 06:20.476
Perry is willing to sign
a non-disclosure.

06:20.478 --> 06:24.079
Randall from Legal has been going
over your agreement. Randall?

06:24.081 --> 06:26.649
Your contract states that
we have to protect your anonymity,

06:26.651 --> 06:29.786
but you're responsible for the actions
on your part that can harm...

06:29.788 --> 06:31.954
- Has he been here this whole time?
- Shh.

06:31.956 --> 06:35.125
Considering Quinn's willingness to sign a
non-disclosure, it's a reasonable request.

06:35.127 --> 06:37.661
Your refusal to meet with him would
constitute a significant loss

06:37.663 --> 06:40.029
of potential revenue
for the film series.

06:40.031 --> 06:41.897
And that would be actionable.

06:41.899 --> 06:44.733
Okay. Bye, Randall.
Thank you.

06:44.735 --> 06:47.839
So, I'm sorry, I'm afraid we can't
let you not meet Perry Quinn.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.673
Fine. Sue me.

06:50.675 --> 06:52.942
I've hardly spent any of
my Merman money anyway.

06:52.944 --> 06:56.712
Oh, no, no. We're talking about a
lot more than your Merman money.

06:56.714 --> 06:58.748
- Oh, yeah? How much more?
- Oh, a lot more.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.017
Plus, with a lawsuit
like this, I mean,

07:01.019 --> 07:04.053
you know, there's no way the
media isn't going to discover

07:04.055 --> 07:05.557
that you're Sally Carmichael.

07:06.625 --> 07:09.058
You... I'm...

07:09.060 --> 07:10.961
You flew all the way out here
to threaten me?

07:10.963 --> 07:13.630
Oh, no, no. No, no.

07:13.632 --> 07:15.968
Threat is not
the right word at all.

07:16.999 --> 07:18.635
We came out here
because we care about you

07:18.637 --> 07:20.904
and we want you to know
what will happen

07:20.906 --> 07:22.942
if you don't meet
with Perry. Ooh!

07:27.045 --> 07:28.844
What is this?

07:28.846 --> 07:31.548
Ah, it's an address of a local bookstore.
3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

07:31.550 --> 07:32.983
Ask for I-sambard.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.817
I-sambard? I was
gonna say Is-ambard.

07:34.819 --> 07:36.952
- Is-ambard?
- I've only seen it written down.

07:36.954 --> 07:39.055
- Is it Turkish?
- Who is Isambard?

07:39.057 --> 07:41.558
Oh, Perry is a bit eccentric.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.594
Just, whatever he wants,
just do it his way.

07:44.596 --> 07:47.096
To avoid a lawsuit.

07:47.098 --> 07:48.231
It's so true.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.699
- I'm just kidding.
- Anyway...

07:50.701 --> 07:52.170
But, you know...

08:15.726 --> 08:17.159
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Oh.

08:17.161 --> 08:19.531
Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

08:20.665 --> 08:23.132
- I'm Tess.
- Hi. Simon.

08:23.134 --> 08:25.135
- I knew it.
- You knew what?

08:25.137 --> 08:26.736
Don't worry. I'm not
a stalker or anything.

08:26.738 --> 08:30.774
This is my bookstore. You did a reading
here years ago for Crossing Through.

08:30.776 --> 08:33.977
Yeah, yeah. I remember, but I
don't remember anyone being here.

08:33.979 --> 08:34.947
I was here.

08:36.181 --> 08:38.881
I was here anyway,
'cause I work here.

08:38.884 --> 08:40.349
But I read your book,
and I loved it.

08:40.351 --> 08:42.318
You did? And...

08:42.321 --> 08:43.852
I'm sorry. You did?

08:43.855 --> 08:45.854
Yes. And yes. Yes.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.059
Um, you working on anything now?

08:49.327 --> 08:52.127
Um, sort of.

08:52.129 --> 08:53.231
Can you tell me about it?

08:54.799 --> 08:56.833
- Not really.
- Come on. One spoiler.

08:56.835 --> 08:59.069
Well...

08:59.071 --> 09:01.774
let's just say I'm trying to figure
out a way to kill someone off,

09:03.075 --> 09:04.974
but I think I'm stuck.

09:04.976 --> 09:07.243
Well, good luck or

09:07.245 --> 09:09.112
break a leg, whatever it is
you say to writers.

09:09.114 --> 09:10.081
Yeah, thank you.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.383
So can I help you
find anything?

09:14.385 --> 09:17.988
Oh. Um, maybe.
I'm looking for...

09:17.990 --> 09:20.890
This is gonna sound ridiculous.
I'm looking for Isambard.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.627
Is that a book
or an author?

09:23.629 --> 09:25.295
It's a person.

09:25.297 --> 09:27.796
It's a work thing. I'm
supposed to meet someone here.

09:27.798 --> 09:31.100
Oh. Well, you know, there are a
whole bunch of chairs in the back.

09:31.102 --> 09:33.203
You're welcome to hang out
as long as you want.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.973
And if anyone named Isambard
walks through the door,

09:36.975 --> 09:38.807
I will know what to do.

09:38.809 --> 09:40.776
Well, thank you very much.

09:40.778 --> 09:42.715
My pleasure, Simon Hayes.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.782
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Just...

09:46.784 --> 09:48.286
- Just back there.
- Oh. Thank you.

09:52.857 --> 09:56.725
Truly loving someone
means truly accepting that person.

09:56.727 --> 09:59.963
Yeah. Like, this Alexander
really a person, though?

09:59.965 --> 10:01.864
Yeah. Of course he is.

10:01.866 --> 10:04.133
You know, he's a merman,
but he's still a man.

10:04.135 --> 10:06.368
- You here for the book club?
- Hey. Come on in.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.773
Take a seat, my brother.
Come on.

10:09.006 --> 10:10.275
Welcome. Hmm.

10:13.412 --> 10:14.379
No.

10:20.785 --> 10:22.852
Come on. Take a seat.

10:22.854 --> 10:24.320
Good times ahead.

10:24.322 --> 10:25.890
Thank you.

10:27.993 --> 10:30.459
Alexander gives up
everything for Sarah.

10:30.461 --> 10:32.228
- Everything.
- Everything.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.796
Yeah. For sure.

10:33.798 --> 10:35.964
Meanwhile, I can't even get
Craig to meet my parents.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.599
Shh, stop.

10:37.601 --> 10:40.969
You know, falling in love with a merman is
actually a metaphor for eternal marriage.

10:40.971 --> 10:43.305
- See that?
- I read it in an article.

10:43.307 --> 10:44.376
- Where?
- Online.

10:45.910 --> 10:48.210
- Interesting. Online.
- Yes.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.246
If Sarah's love for
Alexander was strong enough,

10:50.248 --> 10:52.382
- she could breathe water. That's true.
- Yeah, right.

10:52.384 --> 10:53.849
I feel that.

10:53.851 --> 10:56.752
So you think
fins on men are hot?

10:56.754 --> 11:00.956
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Hot like in that red
flag sort of way, like, "What?"

11:00.958 --> 11:03.727
When you're surrounded
by a school of sharks

11:03.729 --> 11:06.228
and you need find someone
to help you fight them off,

11:06.230 --> 11:08.732
I mean, then let me know if you
still think that's a red flag.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.166
- Yeah. I got you.
- Hey. Spoilers.

11:11.168 --> 11:15.037
I'm only on page 207.
So, please, shut up.

11:15.039 --> 11:18.874
You've had two days.
The spoiler embargo is over.

11:18.876 --> 11:22.112
Yeah. How have you not finished this book?
I couldn't put it down.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.012
How long do you
think it takes

11:24.014 --> 11:28.752
to build something so manly yet
so beautiful at the same time?

11:28.754 --> 11:30.420
Seriously, it's awesome, bro.

11:30.422 --> 11:33.055
- It really is.
- Yeah. Uh, uh, uh, uh.

11:33.057 --> 11:35.257
I've got two words
for you. Merman abs.

11:35.259 --> 11:36.925
- I know. Thank you.
- We live on land,

11:36.927 --> 11:39.429
but our bodies are mostly water.
Think about it.

11:39.431 --> 11:43.366
Sally Carmichael, it's like she
was writing about my life and me.

11:43.368 --> 11:47.036
Or at least what my life could've been
like if I fell in love with a merman.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.972
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.773
Hey, what's your problem, man?

11:50.775 --> 11:52.508
Sure must be easy
judging something

11:52.510 --> 11:54.143
that you don't even know
anything about.

11:54.145 --> 11:55.945
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:55.947 --> 11:57.482
- Good one.
- I know.

12:01.052 --> 12:03.853
All right. Do you wanna
know why you feel like

12:03.855 --> 12:05.888
this book could be
written about you?

12:05.890 --> 12:07.956
Because it could be
written about anybody.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.325
The main character
is an empty shell.

12:10.327 --> 12:13.195
Have you even noticed those books
don't provide any real description

12:13.197 --> 12:15.198
about Sarah other than
her general age

12:15.200 --> 12:18.066
and the fact that she has
red hair and a yellow coat?

12:18.068 --> 12:22.305
That's not true. It says that
Sarah is insecure and shy.

12:22.307 --> 12:23.706
- Mmm-hmm.
- And a bit of a klutz.

12:23.708 --> 12:27.944
- Nailed it.
- Vague character traits that anyone can identify with.

12:27.946 --> 12:31.013
Sarah is never described
with any real detail

12:31.015 --> 12:34.150
so that any reader can plug
herself right into that part

12:34.152 --> 12:36.953
and feel like the story
is being written about her.

12:36.955 --> 12:39.088
And look at you.
You two are dressed like her.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.891
This is not literature.
This is fantasy fulfillment.

12:41.893 --> 12:44.227
Okay. Just because
it isn't Shakespeare

12:44.229 --> 12:45.962
doesn't mean
it isn't literature.

12:45.964 --> 12:47.564
It is Shakespeare. It is.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.300
Shakespeare wrote this
over 400 years ago.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.935
He called it
Romeo and Juliet,

12:51.937 --> 12:53.502
and people have been
ripping it off ever since.

12:53.504 --> 12:54.771
This isn't even a good one.

12:54.773 --> 13:00.209
This is page after page of
manufactured romantic garbage

13:00.211 --> 13:02.177
written by someone,
who, apparently,

13:02.179 --> 13:04.414
is capable of writing
anything better.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.248
Sally Carmichael has a gift.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.618
Hemingway had a gift.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.853
Salinger had a gift.

13:10.855 --> 13:14.623
The ability to write emo
merman porn isn't a gift.

13:14.625 --> 13:15.794
It's a joke.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.264
- You're a joke.
- You're pathetic, man.

13:27.438 --> 13:29.341
At least we agree
on something.

13:35.346 --> 13:37.479
- No Isambard?
- No Isambard.

13:37.481 --> 13:40.049
That was some speech
you gave back there.

13:40.051 --> 13:41.584
You heard that?
I'm sorry.

13:41.586 --> 13:43.353
- I'm-I'm leaving.
- No. Wait...

13:43.355 --> 13:45.121
I mean, I thought
it was interesting.

13:45.123 --> 13:47.422
You thought
that was interesting?

13:47.424 --> 13:50.026
Yeah. It was intense...

13:50.028 --> 13:52.195
- ...but interesting.
- Yeah.

13:52.197 --> 13:54.497
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

13:54.499 --> 13:56.531
Have you ever thought about
writing for a newspaper?

13:56.533 --> 13:58.334
Oh, no. I mean,
I'm not a journalist.

13:58.336 --> 14:00.203
Oh, I'm not talking
about a real newspaper.

14:00.205 --> 14:01.570
I publish the Valley Voice.

14:01.572 --> 14:03.942
It's a small indie paper.
Local stuff.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.042
You run a newspaper
and a bookstore?

14:07.044 --> 14:09.177
If I was good
at either of them,

14:09.179 --> 14:11.314
I'd probably quit the other,
but here I am.

14:11.316 --> 14:17.252
And... Well, I wouldn't know the first thing
about writing a newspaper article, so...

14:17.254 --> 14:20.323
What about an editorial
about the Siren phenomenon?

14:20.325 --> 14:23.559
Why critics hate it
and readers love it?

14:23.561 --> 14:25.161
But I can't. I shouldn't.

14:25.163 --> 14:26.595
You could write down
what you said back there,

14:26.597 --> 14:31.401
and having a published author would
give the Valley Voice a bit of

14:31.403 --> 14:35.007
much-needed credibility. Plus,
you'd be doing me a huge favor.

14:37.341 --> 14:39.342
I, uh...

14:39.344 --> 14:42.311
- When do you need it?
- Anytime.

14:42.313 --> 14:45.348
As long as it's by the
end of the day tomorrow.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.251
I know. I know. I just had a writer
bail on me, and I'm stuck here,

14:48.253 --> 14:49.221
otherwise, I'd do it.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.591
What do you say, Simon Hayes?
Help a big fan out?

14:55.125 --> 14:56.095
Please?

14:58.129 --> 14:59.963
Yeah. All right. Okay.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.431
Just promise you'll try
to keep your expectations low.

15:02.433 --> 15:05.969
I can't promise. I will try,
but I will try to try.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.438
Um, here is my info.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.973
This is my cellphone
and my email,

15:10.975 --> 15:14.647
so call me or email me
or text me, whatever.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.250
Tess Perkins.

15:23.421 --> 15:25.391
- I should go.
- Yeah, you should.

15:40.071 --> 15:42.942
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Simon Hayes for...

15:44.241 --> 15:46.312
Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

15:47.544 --> 15:48.680
Just a minute, Mr. Hayes.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.584
Have a nice day.

16:14.105 --> 16:17.573
Hi. I'm Phillip. Perry
Quinn's executive assistant.

16:17.575 --> 16:19.478
- Hey. Simon.
- Come on in.

16:23.548 --> 16:25.047
Can I get you
something to drink?

16:25.049 --> 16:27.215
Water? Vitamin water?
A beer?

16:27.217 --> 16:29.419
No. I'm fine. Thank you.

16:29.421 --> 16:32.157
Mr. Hayes is here.
All right.

16:34.491 --> 16:35.560
He's ready for you.

16:52.509 --> 16:53.778
Simon Hayes.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.447
Hi.

16:57.682 --> 16:59.183
Sally Carmichael.

17:01.285 --> 17:02.754
Amazing.

17:04.622 --> 17:07.125
I mean, they told me,
but come on.

17:08.393 --> 17:10.596
This is incredible.
You're incredible.

17:12.163 --> 17:13.662
And no one knows?

17:13.664 --> 17:16.665
Everyone thinks
you're some Mormon mom?

17:16.666 --> 17:19.535
Well, I'm Mormon.
I'm not a mom, obviously.

17:19.537 --> 17:22.305
Oh, yeah.
Mormons are great. Yeah.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.606
- Can I get you water? Beer?
- I don't drink.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.175
- I'll get you water and beer.
- I don't. I don't...

17:27.178 --> 17:29.148
I knew this artist
in Chicago.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.748
He had this entire show
at the contemporary art center.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.750
People loved it great.

17:35.752 --> 17:38.754
Turned out
it was all garbage.

17:38.756 --> 17:41.289
Literally garbage.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.726
Stuff he found in dumpsters
all around town.

17:43.728 --> 17:46.731
No one knew. It was incredible.
Incredible.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.365
Not to say your
books are garbage.

17:50.367 --> 17:52.235
I mean, they sold over
100 million copies.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.870
How bad can they be, huh?

17:53.872 --> 17:55.705
Ah, you'll be surprised.

17:55.707 --> 17:59.275
You're modest. I don't like that.
Don't be modest.

17:59.277 --> 18:00.245
Just tell me...

18:02.480 --> 18:03.481
why Perry?

18:07.751 --> 18:10.788
- "Why Perry" what?
- Why Perry Quinn?

18:12.789 --> 18:16.191
- Why not Perry Quinn?
- Why Perry Quinn for this movie?

18:16.193 --> 18:20.429
How? I don't know.
Why not Matthew McConaughey?

18:20.431 --> 18:22.664
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.168
- But I'm also serious.
- Oh.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.702
If I'm gonna commit
to this hoax,

18:27.704 --> 18:32.211
I need to know why you
want me, Perry Quinn?

18:33.510 --> 18:35.413
Right. It-It's not a hoax.

18:38.249 --> 18:40.850
Right. Right.
It's performance art.

18:40.852 --> 18:43.753
You're an artist,
but if I'm involved,

18:43.755 --> 18:46.288
I have a lot invested, too.

18:46.290 --> 18:49.824
Right. Listen. I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

18:49.826 --> 18:51.563
- I'm not an artist.
- I told you. No modesty.

18:52.596 --> 18:53.863
Ah. Uh...

18:53.865 --> 18:55.601
Why don't you
tell me the story?

18:58.303 --> 19:00.503
Well, it's about a merman.

19:00.505 --> 19:02.307
And the young woman
that falls in love with him.

19:03.473 --> 19:04.876
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.879
- Just tell me the story.
- You haven't read it?

19:09.881 --> 19:12.448
Well, why would I ask you to tell
me the story if I'd read it?

19:12.450 --> 19:15.317
Yeah. I guess I just didn't realize
I was here to tell you the story.

19:15.319 --> 19:17.786
Why would I want someone who didn't
write the story to tell me the story?

19:17.788 --> 19:20.488
I mean, I don't want someone who's
not Japanese make me sushi.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.424
You understand
what I'm saying?

19:22.426 --> 19:23.660
I doubt it.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.760
That sounds really good right now.
You want some sushi?

19:25.762 --> 19:28.166
- You wanna go for sushi?
- Oh, no, no. Phillip will get us sushi.

19:30.567 --> 19:31.769
Um...

19:35.006 --> 19:37.539
Listen, Perry...

19:37.541 --> 19:39.775
- you're a great actor...
- Mmm-hmm.

19:39.777 --> 19:41.643
...and I'm sure you'll
be great in this movie.

19:41.645 --> 19:44.613
But I have to tell you, I think
you're talking to the wrong person.

19:44.615 --> 19:46.315
I'm not writing
the screenplay.

19:46.317 --> 19:48.484
I have nothing
to do with it.

19:48.486 --> 19:50.222
Then why are you the one
pitching it to me?

19:51.722 --> 19:55.394
Uh, well, because they told me
you wanted to meet me.

19:57.795 --> 20:00.899
Reverse psychology.
You're good, man. Smart.

20:02.467 --> 20:05.934
I tell you what. I'll have
Phillip read me the book,

20:05.936 --> 20:08.439
and I'll think about it.
I really will.

20:10.441 --> 20:12.607
And that's fair.

20:12.609 --> 20:14.876
It's a real pleasure to
meet you, Simon Hayes.

20:14.878 --> 20:16.280
Come on.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.583
Uh... Sorry.
Uh, there is an audiobook.

20:20.585 --> 20:23.286
Read by some audiobook narrator?
No, thanks.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.321
I'll stick with Phillip.

20:25.323 --> 20:28.623
You know, he's got a BFA from the Lee
Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.528
- Okay.
- Ah, sushi, yes.

20:31.695 --> 20:33.461
See you, Simes.

20:33.463 --> 20:34.930
Awesome.

20:34.932 --> 20:37.767
Which one's the
California rolls?

20:37.769 --> 20:39.869
So, this kid Lucas has been
tracking me all week, right?

20:39.871 --> 20:41.536
Trying to get the drop on me.

20:41.538 --> 20:43.706
So, yesterday,
I sneak up behind him.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.408
Kid's got no idea I'm married.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.476
Simon,
just do it his way.

20:47.478 --> 20:48.878
I mean, to avoid a lawsuit.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.347
The kid, he's got
time to practice.

20:52.349 --> 20:54.850
I got a job. I got a family.
I'm barely online.

20:54.852 --> 20:57.620
Mmm-hmm. Ellie,
not at the table, okay?

20:57.622 --> 21:00.623
But Alexander is about to stand trial
for revealing his species to a human.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.361
He can stand trial
after dinner.

21:03.461 --> 21:04.860
Are we still
working out tomorrow?

21:04.862 --> 21:06.895
'Cause Lucas likes to
show up online around lunch,

21:06.897 --> 21:09.431
and I'd love to be there
when he does.

21:09.433 --> 21:11.834
Oh, I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

21:11.836 --> 21:14.569
I booked this little job.
My deadline's tomorrow morning.

21:14.571 --> 21:15.904
Like a "job" job?

21:15.906 --> 21:17.739
Ah, well,
it's a little article.

21:17.741 --> 21:19.642
- For what?
- The Valley Voice.

21:19.644 --> 21:21.376
And that is?

21:21.378 --> 21:23.778
Exactly. It's just a little
independent newspaper.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.948
The owner said she was in a bind
and asked me if I could help.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.949
"She"?

21:27.951 --> 21:29.884
Yeah. She. So?

21:29.886 --> 21:31.822
You two were just
chatting it up?

21:32.923 --> 21:34.690
What does that mean?

21:34.692 --> 21:38.361
Nothing. It's just...
You don't ever chat anyone up.

21:38.363 --> 21:42.364
What are you talking about? I chat. I'm
chatting you up right now. I'm very chatty.

21:42.366 --> 21:45.468
- We're the only people you ever chat up.
- That's not true.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.569
And we only talk
because you're my brother.

21:47.571 --> 21:50.773
Uncle Simon, is she pretty?

21:50.775 --> 21:54.410
Look, you guys are reading
way too much into this.

21:54.412 --> 21:56.946
This is just a tiny little article
in a tiny little newspaper

21:56.948 --> 22:00.382
- that no one's ever gonna read.
- How did you two even meet?

22:00.384 --> 22:04.586
Well, we met at this little
bookstore which she also owns,

22:04.588 --> 22:06.724
which is not important.
Look, I was there to meet...

22:08.058 --> 22:09.991
Who?

22:09.993 --> 22:12.430
Never mind.
Guys, it's nothing.

22:13.631 --> 22:15.430
This is really something.

22:15.432 --> 22:17.900
That's a relief, 'cause I was
only going for "not horrible."

22:17.902 --> 22:20.835
I'm not kidding, Simon.
I mean, it's pretty harsh,

22:20.837 --> 22:23.805
but you really seem to get how
and why these books work.

22:23.807 --> 22:25.507
You know, you should
write a young adult novel.

22:25.509 --> 22:26.778
You could probably
make a million bucks.

22:27.778 --> 22:29.044
I even love the title.

22:29.046 --> 22:31.814
The New York Times
number one best sellout.

22:31.816 --> 22:33.181
Do you have
a recent headshot?

22:33.183 --> 22:34.417
Uh, no, why?

22:34.419 --> 22:36.919
For the byline. I can just
grab a quick one right now.

22:36.921 --> 22:39.421
Oh, no. That's okay.
We don't need that.

22:39.423 --> 22:40.890
Bad hair day?

22:40.892 --> 22:44.492
Uh, no.
Sorta have a thing.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.094
What kind of sorta thing?

22:46.096 --> 22:49.597
Uh, cameras. I'm not great in
front of them. It's a thing.

22:49.599 --> 22:51.633
So you're camera-shy?

22:51.635 --> 22:54.103
Well, that's one way of putting it. The
other way would be anxiety disorder.

22:54.105 --> 22:55.837
Your way's nicer.

22:55.839 --> 22:58.676
Well, that is a thing.

22:59.977 --> 23:04.212
Yeah. I-I had a full-blown
panic attack

23:04.214 --> 23:06.614
during tenth grade
yearbook picture.

23:06.616 --> 23:10.186
It's the kind of thing that sticks
with you well past graduation.

23:10.188 --> 23:13.021
Maybe you're looking
at it the wrong way.

23:13.023 --> 23:15.990
Maybe you're just super-awesome
at stage fright.

23:17.127 --> 23:19.461
No worries. I can just use
the picture from your book.

23:19.463 --> 23:21.130
And if it's any consolation,

23:21.132 --> 23:22.998
hardly anyone's gonna
see it anyway.

23:24.201 --> 23:26.969
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, Mom.

23:26.971 --> 23:29.838
Andie, this is Mr. Hayes. He's
helping me with the paper.

23:29.840 --> 23:33.241
Hi. It's nice to meet you.
You can call me Simon.

23:33.243 --> 23:34.876
Hi, Simon.

23:34.878 --> 23:36.211
Mom, my friends
are on their way.

23:36.213 --> 23:37.880
Can I go out front
and wait for them?

23:37.882 --> 23:39.882
Sure. Say hi to
Avery's mom for me.

23:39.884 --> 23:42.250
- I will.
- Bye, Andie.

23:42.252 --> 23:43.454
Bye.

23:45.155 --> 23:47.922
I've been so busy today.
I skipped lunch.

23:47.924 --> 23:49.560
You hungry?

23:52.529 --> 23:54.129
Thank you.

23:54.131 --> 23:56.999
You know, I wasn't kidding
about the young-adult thing.

23:57.768 --> 24:00.870
I wouldn't want
my name on something like that.

24:00.872 --> 24:04.942
Still, can you imagine having created
something that wildly popular?

24:06.109 --> 24:07.809
We're still trying
to talk places

24:07.811 --> 24:10.613
into giving the Voice
away for free.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.280
Wait. You're not online?

24:12.282 --> 24:15.217
We are, but I don't know,
it's stupid.

24:15.219 --> 24:19.555
Hey, don't forget. You're talking to
the yearbook pic panic attack guy.

24:19.557 --> 24:23.191
Well, ever since I was in high school,
I dreamed of having a real newspaper,

24:23.193 --> 24:26.594
one that, you know,
you carry under your arm

24:26.596 --> 24:30.032
and take home and cut stuff out
of and paste into scrapbooks.

24:30.034 --> 24:33.602
So your high school dream was to
start a newspaper in the 1930s?

24:33.604 --> 24:35.537
I told you it was stupid.

24:35.539 --> 24:37.907
No. No, I get it.

24:37.909 --> 24:40.575
You have the chance to do something
you've always wanted to do,

24:40.577 --> 24:43.045
and you wanna do it right,
and you wanna do it your way.

24:43.047 --> 24:46.548
Exactly. Why should I spend as
much time and effort on something

24:46.550 --> 24:48.185
unless it's something
I'm gonna be proud of?

24:49.287 --> 24:50.952
Yeah.

24:50.954 --> 24:52.787
Can I ask you
a personal question?

24:52.789 --> 24:54.289
Uh, sure.

24:54.291 --> 24:55.826
Are you proud of your book?

24:57.795 --> 24:59.862
Yeah. Crossing Through?

24:59.864 --> 25:02.200
Yeah. Unless there's another book that
you wrote that I don't know about.

25:07.971 --> 25:10.838
I-I was proud of it
when it was published.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.276
And then?

25:13.611 --> 25:15.044
Then nobody read it.

25:15.046 --> 25:17.182
I read it. I'm somebody.

25:18.316 --> 25:19.815
You certainly are.

25:19.817 --> 25:22.017
Besides, whoever said that
the value of a book

25:22.019 --> 25:24.085
is measured in how
many copies it sells?

25:24.087 --> 25:25.856
- Everybody.
- Not me.

25:27.124 --> 25:29.290
And you're somebody.

25:29.292 --> 25:30.594
I certainly am.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.633
Forty-love.

25:38.635 --> 25:41.135
So whatever happened with
that girl at the bookstore?

25:41.137 --> 25:42.604
Her name's Tess.

25:42.606 --> 25:44.373
She has a name then.
That's progress.

25:44.375 --> 25:48.242
Well, it's just work.

25:48.244 --> 25:51.046
Please tell me you're working it while you work.

25:51.048 --> 25:52.680
Come on. I'm not like you.

25:52.682 --> 25:55.950
But you could be.
You just worry too much.

25:55.952 --> 25:59.354
It's funny you should say that.
I told her about my anxiety.

25:59.356 --> 26:00.925
- Really?
- Hmm.

26:02.058 --> 26:04.860
I wasn't planning on it.
I just...

26:04.862 --> 26:08.396
I don't know. I guess I felt
comfortable and then it just came out.

26:08.398 --> 26:10.766
- Well, how'd she react?
- Fine.

26:10.768 --> 26:13.235
No weirdness.
No judgment. No nothing.

26:13.237 --> 26:16.904
And now somehow, you're gonna
find the bad news in all this.

26:16.906 --> 26:19.208
Well, I was doing her
a favor at the time,

26:19.210 --> 26:20.742
so how was she
supposed to react?

26:20.744 --> 26:21.977
And there it is.

26:21.979 --> 26:23.879
That's not looking
for the bad news.

26:23.881 --> 26:25.180
That's painting
the full picture.

26:25.182 --> 26:28.950
Okay. Well, paint the full picture
for me, then. Is she pretty?

26:28.952 --> 26:30.719
She is beautiful.

26:30.721 --> 26:32.955
And now you're worried
that she won't like you

26:32.957 --> 26:34.657
now that she doesn't
need something from you.

26:34.659 --> 26:35.927
No.

26:37.161 --> 26:39.327
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

26:39.329 --> 26:40.863
Well, just wait and see.

26:40.865 --> 26:42.096
You'll know.

26:42.098 --> 26:43.931
How will I know?

26:43.933 --> 26:47.271
You'll know when you know,
'cause you know. Ha!

26:51.241 --> 26:53.676
- Oh, sorry.
- Mr. Hayes.

26:53.678 --> 26:55.844
Hi. I'm Phillip. I'm Perry
Quinn's executive assistant.

26:55.846 --> 26:58.380
Yeah. Hey, Phillip, we've met.
Please. Just Simon.

26:58.382 --> 27:00.215
- Thanks so much for coming.
- Yeah.

27:00.217 --> 27:02.217
Perry is so excited
to talk to you today,

27:02.219 --> 27:04.186
but he's prepping
for a big scene,

27:04.188 --> 27:06.388
so he's staying
in character all day.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.390
- What does that mean?
- Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

27:08.392 --> 27:10.726
He's still the same old Perry.

27:10.728 --> 27:13.062
But he's also Isambard
Kingdom Brunel,

27:13.064 --> 27:15.863
creator of the Great
Western Railway.

27:15.865 --> 27:18.132
It's no big deal, really,
but just make sure

27:18.134 --> 27:20.835
that you address him
as Isambard.

27:20.837 --> 27:23.008
- You're kidding.
- No.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.242
He's ready for you.

27:30.346 --> 27:32.346
Ah.

27:32.348 --> 27:35.417
Simon, old chap.
Jolly good to see you.

27:35.419 --> 27:37.719
- Isambard?
- Is-ambard. Is-ambard.

27:37.721 --> 27:40.055
- Is-Is-ambard.
- Can I get you anything?

27:40.057 --> 27:41.856
Water? Ale?

27:41.858 --> 27:44.125
- Sure. Water.
- Water.

27:44.127 --> 27:45.494
Wonderful. Wonderful.

27:45.496 --> 27:49.264
I just finished your novel, and
it was the most hilarious book

27:49.266 --> 27:52.801
Phillip has ever read to me.
Just extraordinary.

27:52.803 --> 27:54.402
You thought it was hilarious?

27:54.404 --> 27:56.805
Are you jesting? I mean,
you sold millions of books

27:56.807 --> 27:59.373
about a girl who falls
in love with a bloody merman,

27:59.375 --> 28:02.210
and no one knows it's a prank.
That's hilarious.

28:02.212 --> 28:05.748
Ah, Phillip, thou hast brought
hither the water, my man.

28:05.750 --> 28:06.949
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

28:06.951 --> 28:08.984
So, I don't have
much time today,

28:08.986 --> 28:10.789
but I wanted to tell you
face-to-face.

28:12.155 --> 28:13.788
I'm in.

28:13.790 --> 28:15.423
You're in? The movie?
That's great.

28:15.425 --> 28:17.426
I've just got to work
with the old sport.

28:17.428 --> 28:19.297
I... Well, I'm not working
on the movie.

28:22.098 --> 28:24.201
Right. Right.
But what's next?

28:25.536 --> 28:27.369
Uh, what do you mean?

28:27.371 --> 28:30.072
You see, there's one thing
I know, it's story.

28:30.074 --> 28:32.940
And the real story
here is you.

28:32.942 --> 28:34.276
You see, I said yes
to this movie

28:34.278 --> 28:37.045
because I'm in the
Simon Hayes business.

28:37.047 --> 28:39.347
And I want to know what
you've got planned next.

28:39.349 --> 28:41.182
I'm all ears.
I'm on pins and needles.

28:41.184 --> 28:43.485
Uh...

28:43.487 --> 28:46.188
- Listen, Perry...
- Isambard. Isambard.

28:46.190 --> 28:48.422
Isambard, I, uh...

28:48.424 --> 28:50.859
- I'm thrilled you're doing the movie. I really am.
- Me, too.

28:50.861 --> 28:52.995
But I don't have
anything planned next.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.400
This whole thing
was just a fluke.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.034
Fine. Fine.

28:59.036 --> 29:02.437
- No. I'm serious.
- Sure. Sure.

29:02.439 --> 29:04.206
Scout's honor.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.307
What does that mean?

29:06.309 --> 29:08.376
You're going to do something
with the Boy Scouts?

29:08.378 --> 29:10.879
What? No. No.

29:10.881 --> 29:12.547
I'm just a writer.
I'm not even a good one.

29:12.549 --> 29:17.052
Do you know what you are?
You are an artist. Yes.

29:17.054 --> 29:19.555
Do you have any idea
how rare that is?

29:19.557 --> 29:21.289
- I really don't.
- No. No.

29:21.291 --> 29:23.525
No. A true artist wouldn't.

29:23.527 --> 29:26.194
See, you're the kind of chap
that comes once a generation.

29:26.196 --> 29:28.365
Maybe less. You have a gift.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.299
Uh, Isambard?

29:31.301 --> 29:33.535
Isambard. Yes, yes.
I drive art.

29:33.537 --> 29:36.270
I support art.
I nurture the creation of art,

29:36.272 --> 29:38.373
because I understand that art

29:38.375 --> 29:40.778
has the power
to change the world.

29:41.578 --> 29:43.879
That's my job.

29:43.881 --> 29:47.051
That's my gift to the world.

29:49.987 --> 29:52.386
I know you're going to do something.
I don't know what it is.

29:52.388 --> 29:54.222
- But...
- Shh.

29:54.224 --> 29:57.159
But I'm ready.
We're in this together.

29:57.161 --> 29:59.995
Embrace me, my friend.
Embrace me.

29:59.997 --> 30:02.396
We're in this together.
Together. Do you hear?

30:02.398 --> 30:04.268
Ah. I'm never letting go.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.609
- Cute bag.
- Thanks.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.814
Did you steal it
from a homeless person?

30:18.048 --> 30:19.381
It was my dad's.

30:19.383 --> 30:22.150
Your dad's homeless?
That's so sad.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.329
Hey, honey.

30:33.596 --> 30:34.566
Andie?

30:39.336 --> 30:40.602
Hey, couldn't you hear me?

30:45.108 --> 30:46.909
What's wrong?

30:46.911 --> 30:48.112
Nothing.

30:50.213 --> 30:51.548
Are you sure?

30:53.217 --> 30:55.854
Some people are
just jerks sometimes.

30:58.923 --> 30:59.958
What happened?

31:03.227 --> 31:05.463
Honey, I need you to tell me
what happened, please.

31:08.531 --> 31:10.567
Just some girls from school.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.005
They made fun of my bag.

31:20.176 --> 31:22.480
You know we can always
get you a new bag.

31:24.414 --> 31:27.218
A really cute one.
If you want.

31:30.487 --> 31:32.257
I like this one.

31:34.959 --> 31:35.960
I know.

31:39.262 --> 31:41.064
Some people are
jerks sometimes.

32:04.421 --> 32:05.988
- Hello, Darren.
- Dude.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.989
What did you do?

32:07.991 --> 32:09.224
What do you mean?

32:09.226 --> 32:11.293
I just got off the phone
with Perry's agent.

32:11.295 --> 32:14.296
He said Perry loves you.

32:14.298 --> 32:17.298
No, correction. He said
Perry's "in love" with you.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.633
This call isn't about
to get weird, is it?

32:19.635 --> 32:23.537
No! I just wanted to
let you know, great work, man.

32:23.539 --> 32:27.575
No. I'm happy to help as long as
it means you're not gonna sue me.

32:27.577 --> 32:30.478
You are hilarious.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.715
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

32:33.683 --> 32:35.182
What? What does that mean?

32:35.184 --> 32:36.785
Nah. I'm just messing with you.

32:36.787 --> 32:38.719
He's gonna sign
the deal, all right?

32:38.721 --> 32:40.622
So, of course,
we're not gonna sue you.

32:40.624 --> 32:42.790
Right. But what if he doesn't?

32:42.792 --> 32:44.528
But he will, right?

32:46.529 --> 32:48.529
- But what if he doesn't?
- Okay.

32:48.531 --> 32:50.297
You are a riot, Simon.

32:50.299 --> 32:52.267
- We'll talk to you later.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

32:52.269 --> 32:53.668
Darren, what if he doesn't?

32:53.670 --> 32:56.037
Oh, well, who was
on first?

32:56.039 --> 32:57.706
Relax. Nobody's gonna get sued.

32:57.708 --> 33:00.275
But if anyone does,
you'll be the first to know.

33:00.277 --> 33:01.809
- No. Darren...
- Take care, buddy.

33:01.811 --> 33:02.980
Darren?

35:34.630 --> 35:39.833
So, you're ten...
11...

35:39.835 --> 35:41.936
- 12.
- 12. I said 12.

35:41.938 --> 35:43.707
I hope you like
spaghetti, because...

35:45.442 --> 35:47.575
I know how to make spaghetti.

35:47.577 --> 35:48.844
It's spaghetti Tuesday.

35:48.846 --> 35:51.345
I wanted to try Taco Tuesday,
you know, for the alliteration...

35:51.347 --> 35:52.847
But I don't like tacos.

35:52.849 --> 35:55.249
And none of the days
of the week start with "spa."

35:55.251 --> 35:56.586
- We checked.
- That's true.

35:58.355 --> 35:59.554
Do you mind?

35:59.556 --> 36:01.623
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Simon.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.394
Would you rather have
three ears or no ears?

36:05.728 --> 36:08.429
- Uh...
- Don't look at me. It's your question.

36:08.431 --> 36:12.636
Well, may I ask where
the third ear would be located?

36:14.003 --> 36:15.804
In the middle
of your forehead.

36:15.806 --> 36:19.374
Oh. Well, in that case,
definitely three ears,

36:19.376 --> 36:22.711
'cause I could hear what's
coming, and I'd be unstoppable.

36:22.713 --> 36:27.315
Would you rather wrestle
a bear or a shark?

36:27.317 --> 36:29.416
Well, if I'm on land,
a shark,

36:29.418 --> 36:31.920
because it wouldn't be able to breathe.
But if I'm in water,

36:31.922 --> 36:33.588
a bear, because
bears can't swim.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.760
- Bears can totally swim.
- But not as good as sharks.

36:36.893 --> 36:39.327
- Hmm.
- Would you rather

36:39.329 --> 36:42.563
eat a used Band-Aid
or a dirty dish-rack?

36:42.565 --> 36:45.633
Hmm. I'd actually try both.

36:45.635 --> 36:47.735
Dish-racks have more flavor.

36:47.737 --> 36:49.838
Ew!

36:49.840 --> 36:51.309
Would you rather...

36:52.909 --> 36:55.709
find a zombie
or get struck by lightning?

36:55.711 --> 36:59.046
Zombies aren't real, and people don't
really get struck by lightning.

36:59.048 --> 37:00.949
- Oh, yeah. Sure they do.
- Nah-uh.

37:00.951 --> 37:03.385
Thousands of people get struck
by lightning every year.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.854
- Really?
- And there are seven billion people on the planet,

37:06.856 --> 37:09.624
so the chances of you getting struck
by lightning are really small.

37:09.626 --> 37:11.592
Still, gotta happen
to somebody.

37:16.365 --> 37:19.402
Uh, Andie, what do you
wanna be when you grow up?

37:22.739 --> 37:24.405
A writer.

37:24.407 --> 37:26.941
Oh. A writer, really?

37:26.943 --> 37:27.912
She's my little reader.

37:29.079 --> 37:30.744
I love to read, too.

37:30.746 --> 37:33.648
Yeah. But I don't like to
read the same stuff you do.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.583
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?

37:35.585 --> 37:37.922
Because I love the Siren books,
and you hate them.

37:39.856 --> 37:42.023
Ah, come on. I don't...

37:42.025 --> 37:44.059
Yeah, I kinda do hate them.

37:44.061 --> 37:47.095
Did I neglect to mention that
my daughter is a huge fan?

37:47.097 --> 37:49.597
- Yeah.
- I read the first two books twice,

37:49.599 --> 37:51.398
and I'm almost done
with the third.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.867
Yeah. When I got her
the first one,

37:52.869 --> 37:55.804
she carried it around
everywhere with her for months,

37:55.806 --> 37:57.639
and now the cover's
falling off.

37:57.641 --> 37:59.307
The book is totally warped.

37:59.309 --> 38:03.878
Should probably get her a new one before
she catches some gross disease from it.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.512
So what do you
like about him?

38:05.514 --> 38:07.682
I don't know.
They just make me happy.

38:07.684 --> 38:10.818
Oh, and I heard that Perry Quinn
might play Alexander in the movie.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.653
You are not a Perry Quinn fan?

38:12.655 --> 38:15.590
Are you kidding?
He's so awesome.

38:15.592 --> 38:17.662
If he's in the movie,
I will die.

38:18.695 --> 38:19.927
- Hey.
- Sorry.

38:19.929 --> 38:21.298
Careful.

38:26.469 --> 38:29.537
She doesn't usually warm up to new
people as quickly. What's your secret?

38:29.539 --> 38:32.874
Ah. I'm emotionally stunted.

38:32.876 --> 38:35.677
Some kids gave her hard time
after school today.

38:35.679 --> 38:37.479
Just girl stuff.
No big deal.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.380
Still, you probably
wanted to murder them.

38:39.382 --> 38:42.117
Right, and their
little jerk faces.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.619
She's just so gentle.
I mean, you know bullies,

38:44.621 --> 38:46.720
if they sense any
vulnerability, they...

38:46.722 --> 38:49.691
Oh, I used to get bullied
when I was in middle school.

38:49.693 --> 38:53.394
My dad told me the kid was picking
on me because he was scared of me.

38:53.396 --> 38:56.063
It made absolutely no sense,
'cause he was twice my size

38:56.065 --> 38:57.768
and just pummeled me weekly.

39:02.105 --> 39:04.104
What?

39:04.106 --> 39:06.009
Yeah, well, there's something.

39:07.610 --> 39:09.510
Sorry. I just...

39:09.512 --> 39:12.079
There's probably no
perfect time to say this,

39:12.081 --> 39:15.083
so I guess I'll just decide
that now is the time to tell you

39:15.085 --> 39:16.887
that her dad died
four years ago.

39:19.121 --> 39:20.623
Uh...

39:21.858 --> 39:23.657
I'm so sorry.

39:23.659 --> 39:25.559
See? And then you
feel sorry for us,

39:25.561 --> 39:27.829
and I tell you
that it's okay,

39:27.831 --> 39:30.764
'cause it was a while ago,
and it really is okay.

39:30.766 --> 39:33.802
You don't believe me,
so I reassure you

39:33.804 --> 39:35.737
and that could take forever.

39:35.739 --> 39:38.708
So can we just skip
past that for now?

39:39.876 --> 39:42.713
Uh, sure. Yeah, for now.

39:46.949 --> 39:48.885
Opening the bookstore
was his dream.

39:50.686 --> 39:52.123
The newspaper was my thing.

39:53.824 --> 39:56.827
We decided that we would work
on his first and then mine.

39:58.929 --> 39:59.896
And then...

40:02.565 --> 40:06.099
I can't abandon
the store, but...

40:06.101 --> 40:09.038
I'm not really ready to give up
on my plans yet either, so...

40:12.074 --> 40:15.678
Now I'm doing both, and I'm probably
not doing either very well.

40:17.713 --> 40:20.550
Mostly, I just wanna make sure
I'm doing enough for her.

40:21.885 --> 40:23.721
Hey. Come on. You are.

40:25.188 --> 40:27.521
How do you know?

40:27.523 --> 40:29.224
Huh.

40:29.226 --> 40:30.628
Spaghetti Tuesday.

40:38.034 --> 40:39.766
Get that guy.
Get that guy.

40:39.768 --> 40:41.001
Will you relax?

40:41.003 --> 40:42.936
Don't tell me to relax.
You do your job.

40:42.938 --> 40:45.273
You kill that guy,
then I'll relax.

40:45.275 --> 40:48.809
We need new hobbies.
Like real hobbies.

40:48.811 --> 40:50.211
I work at a Credit Union,

40:50.213 --> 40:53.981
and everyday is literally
the same as the day before.

40:53.983 --> 40:55.583
Do not take this
away from me.

40:55.585 --> 40:57.017
All right. All right.

40:57.019 --> 41:00.153
- What happened with Tess?
- Well, still happening.

41:00.155 --> 41:02.726
Ah. Is anything happening?

41:04.594 --> 41:06.894
I don't know.
I think. Maybe.

41:06.896 --> 41:08.829
- Who's Tess?
- Who's this?

41:08.831 --> 41:11.566
That woman that Simon's been
seeing from the bookstore.

41:11.568 --> 41:12.900
Oh, right.

41:12.902 --> 41:14.202
That's just Lucas.
He's cool.

41:14.204 --> 41:15.836
Sorry. Go ahead.

41:15.838 --> 41:17.704
Well, I'm not
seeing her, exactly.

41:17.706 --> 41:19.773
Wait a minute.
Who else did you tell?

41:19.775 --> 41:22.010
- Relax. He's from Pittsburgh.
- Portland.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.845
It's the same thing.
Don't change the subject.

41:23.847 --> 41:25.213
So what's the deal?

41:25.215 --> 41:26.981
All right. When you were single,

41:26.983 --> 41:28.749
did you ever keep something
from someone you met

41:28.751 --> 41:30.117
just because it was
personal or private,

41:30.119 --> 41:32.186
but then when you really
started to get to know her,

41:32.188 --> 41:33.554
you just kept not telling her

41:33.556 --> 41:36.758
so it kind of turned from a
personal secret into sort of a lie?

41:36.760 --> 41:38.659
Well, look, when I was single,

41:38.661 --> 41:41.563
there was a lot of things I didn't
tell a lot of girls I went out with.

41:41.565 --> 41:42.930
Yeah, but this is kind of big.

41:42.932 --> 41:46.034
- Well, do I know?
- No.

41:46.036 --> 41:48.702
So tell me, and then I'll tell
you if you should tell her.

41:48.704 --> 41:50.838
I'm not ready
to tell anyone.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.974
- You can tell me.
- Shut up, Lucas!

41:52.976 --> 41:56.144
All right. Just tell her
on your own schedule.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.979
You'll know when
the time's right.

41:57.981 --> 41:59.813
I'll know when I know,
because I'll know.

41:59.815 --> 42:01.215
Precisely.

42:01.217 --> 42:03.050
- Hey, Lucas.
- Yeah?

42:03.052 --> 42:03.952
Look behind you, buddy.

42:03.954 --> 42:06.688
- No. No, wait!
- Yippee ki-yay!

43:07.217 --> 43:08.583
Uh, excuse me.

43:08.585 --> 43:11.985
Are you the guy that wrote the
article about the Merman books?

43:11.987 --> 43:14.354
- Uh, yeah.
- Uh, I thought so.

43:14.356 --> 43:17.124
You just look so familiar.
Great article, by the way.

43:17.126 --> 43:19.327
Well, thanks.

43:19.329 --> 43:23.197
You know, the woman who owns the newspaper
is gonna be really happy someone read it.

43:23.199 --> 43:26.099
You know, my sister
loves those books,

43:26.101 --> 43:27.934
and I just keep telling her
how awful they are,

43:27.936 --> 43:30.704
so I showed her your article,
and now she hates you.

43:30.706 --> 43:32.305
So nice work.

43:32.307 --> 43:34.876
Thanks, and sorry.

43:34.878 --> 43:36.646
You're welcome,
and she'll be fine.

43:40.717 --> 43:43.684
She really said that?
She said her sister hates you?

43:43.686 --> 43:46.119
Well, let's not forget
the "nice work" part.

43:46.121 --> 43:48.222
That's a reaction.
That's two reactions.

43:48.224 --> 43:50.791
If those two people share it
with two more people,

43:50.793 --> 43:52.760
and those four people
share it with four more people,

43:52.762 --> 43:54.896
that's 16 people
who read the Valley Voice.

43:54.898 --> 43:57.197
Before you know it,
that's like a billion people.

43:57.199 --> 43:58.800
Mmm-hmm.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.735
Hey, babe. How was school?

44:00.737 --> 44:02.704
- Good.
- Math test?

44:02.706 --> 44:04.204
- 93.
- Nice.

44:04.206 --> 44:07.041
- This weekend, we mini-golf.
- Yes!

44:07.043 --> 44:10.811
Um, I might have something
that's better than mini-golf.

44:10.813 --> 44:11.947
Really? What?

44:11.949 --> 44:14.315
Well, it just occurred to me
that a nice girl like you

44:14.317 --> 44:16.383
shouldn't have to walk around
with a beat-up book.

44:16.385 --> 44:19.487
It's not classy or hygienic.

44:19.489 --> 44:23.124
And I just happened
to have this

44:23.126 --> 44:26.126
first edition
just hanging around.

44:26.128 --> 44:27.662
And let's be honest,
I'm not gonna read it,

44:27.664 --> 44:30.498
so I got to thinking, "Who do I know
that would get good use out of this?"

44:30.500 --> 44:31.668
Me!

44:33.202 --> 44:34.735
Mmm!

44:34.737 --> 44:36.003
What are you doing, weirdo?

44:36.005 --> 44:37.204
It smells good.

44:37.206 --> 44:38.741
Open the front cover.

44:42.045 --> 44:44.112
No way.
No way. No way.

44:44.114 --> 44:45.780
What?

44:45.782 --> 44:46.950
She signed it.

44:48.985 --> 44:52.186
Sally and I have the same publisher.
I called in a favor.

44:52.188 --> 44:54.121
- Mom, can I go call Avery?
- Sure.

44:54.123 --> 44:57.391
Hang on. Aren't you
forgetting something?

44:57.393 --> 45:00.030
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh. You're welcome.

45:02.998 --> 45:05.001
Is that real?
You can tell me.

45:07.103 --> 45:08.905
That's the author's signature.

45:10.206 --> 45:11.275
It's nothing.

45:14.309 --> 45:15.775
That girl she's on
the phone with

45:15.777 --> 45:19.146
never even talked to Andie before
they started reading the Siren books,

45:19.148 --> 45:21.050
and now they're
joined at the hip.

45:22.284 --> 45:25.755
She used to be so shy and...

45:27.356 --> 45:29.557
closed-off. Um...

45:29.559 --> 45:31.191
I tried everything
I could think of

45:31.193 --> 45:34.128
to break her out of her shell,
and nothing worked.

45:34.130 --> 45:36.530
To be honest with you, I was
getting kind of worried about her.

45:36.532 --> 45:39.467
And then I got her
that book, and that.

45:39.469 --> 45:41.802
She started talking more.
She made new friends.

45:41.804 --> 45:43.503
She's reading all the time.

45:43.505 --> 45:45.173
Have to take the books
away from her

45:45.175 --> 45:46.974
so that she'll go
to sleep at night.

45:48.143 --> 45:49.946
Those books have done
so much for her.

45:51.847 --> 45:54.751
So, what you did,
that's something.

45:58.454 --> 46:00.524
- No, no, no. It's real.
- Yeah.

46:02.324 --> 46:05.959
Yeah. I'm gonna
read it so many times.

46:05.961 --> 46:08.197
It's probably, like,
my tenth time reading it.

46:09.431 --> 46:11.097
What you
guys doing here?

46:11.099 --> 46:12.769
Simon, we need to talk.

46:13.969 --> 46:15.936
Uh, is there a problem?

46:15.938 --> 46:17.273
Perry Quinn is out.

46:18.340 --> 46:20.441
What? No.
He said he was in.

46:20.443 --> 46:23.043
Now he changed his mind, and someone
has to be held accountable.

46:23.045 --> 46:26.112
We are suing you for damages.
We have no choice.

46:26.114 --> 46:29.282
- For-For how much?
- Well, more than you have, I assure you.

46:29.284 --> 46:31.251
Well, you're gonna
have to work it off.

46:31.253 --> 46:33.387
That means more Merman novels.

46:33.389 --> 46:35.289
Well, how many more?

46:35.291 --> 46:37.958
- Well, as many as it takes.
- No. No.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.961
He said he was in.
This isn't my fault.

46:39.963 --> 46:42.597
You're gonna have to start doing
interviews and book signings.

46:44.967 --> 46:46.566
You can't do that.
My contract.

46:46.568 --> 46:49.637
You don't have a contract anymore.
Everyone's gonna know.

46:49.639 --> 46:52.405
You're going to be the author of
Siren for the rest of your life.

46:52.407 --> 46:54.909
- What's the matter with you?
- Ew, gross.

46:54.911 --> 46:56.610
- What?
- You can tell me.

46:58.081 --> 46:59.512
Are you proud
of your book?

46:59.514 --> 47:02.617
Sally Carmichael!
You are an artist.

47:02.619 --> 47:04.318
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

47:04.320 --> 47:05.519
Hey, what's
your problem, man?

47:05.521 --> 47:06.586
A writer.

47:06.588 --> 47:07.921
An artist.

47:23.338 --> 47:27.041
- What can I get ya?
- Hey, I'll have the chicken avocado, please.

47:27.043 --> 47:28.144
Yeah. That's $8.50.

47:29.579 --> 47:31.177
There you go.
Keep the change.

47:31.179 --> 47:32.415
Thank you.

47:58.440 --> 47:59.576
Simon?

48:00.710 --> 48:02.208
Thanks. Thank you.

48:02.210 --> 48:03.945
Wait a minute.
How did you know my name?

48:03.947 --> 48:06.316
Seriously, you should probably
Google yourself, buddy.

48:15.123 --> 48:16.657
How did you find out about this?

48:16.659 --> 48:19.059
The guy at the food truck
told me to Google myself.

48:19.061 --> 48:20.728
When did I become Google-able?

48:20.730 --> 48:23.331
I submitted the editorial
to the Associated Press.

48:23.333 --> 48:25.066
I didn't really think
anything would come of it,

48:25.068 --> 48:27.735
but it looks like some papers
picked it up. Big papers.

48:27.737 --> 48:31.271
And tons of blogs.
Simon, you've gone viral.

48:31.273 --> 48:33.039
- This is not good.
- This is great.

48:33.041 --> 48:35.008
What if someone finds out?
What if...

48:35.010 --> 48:38.179
People are reading something you
wrote, and they're loving it.

48:38.181 --> 48:41.514
"Simon says Siren sucks.
I say Simon sucks."

48:41.516 --> 48:43.016
That's one tweet.

48:43.018 --> 48:45.987
"I hope Simon Hayes dies
and so should you."

48:45.989 --> 48:47.521
You're trending.

48:47.523 --> 48:49.289
Some of it's gonna be good. Some isn't.

48:49.291 --> 48:50.624
I don't even know
what "trending" means.

48:50.626 --> 48:53.126
What is it?

48:53.128 --> 48:56.199
Uh, it's a drunk text.

48:57.733 --> 48:59.266
Answer it.

48:59.268 --> 49:00.568
Uh, it's an unknown number.

49:00.570 --> 49:02.769
If it's important,
they'll call back. Tess?

49:02.771 --> 49:05.976
Simon's phone. This is his assistant.
Who I may say is calling?

49:08.311 --> 49:10.711
- Uh-huh.
- Before you say anything...

49:10.713 --> 49:12.983
It's a producer from
Good Things Utah.

49:15.385 --> 49:16.653
Hello?

49:17.719 --> 49:20.253
Uh, yes. This is he.

49:20.255 --> 49:22.623
Um, well, thank you.

49:22.625 --> 49:25.228
Well, that's...
Oh, really?

49:26.596 --> 49:29.396
Uh, can you hold on
for just a second?

49:29.398 --> 49:31.097
They wanna interview me
tomorrow morning.

49:31.099 --> 49:32.735
- What you gonna say?
- I can't. It's TV. I can't.

49:34.670 --> 49:37.771
Can we take a look at his schedule
and call you back? Thanks.

49:37.773 --> 49:39.673
- No, no, Tess. I can't.
- I know.

49:39.675 --> 49:42.675
I'm just thinking of,
you know...

49:42.677 --> 49:45.146
I gotta sit down.

49:45.148 --> 49:46.983
Simon, it's okay.

49:48.050 --> 49:49.485
You don't have to do this.

49:51.119 --> 49:53.287
Wouldn't it be great
publicity for the paper?

49:53.289 --> 49:55.289
Well, yeah, sure,
but that does not matter.

49:55.291 --> 49:57.291
- Of course it matters.
- Hey!

49:57.293 --> 50:00.396
You don't have
to do this. Okay?

50:01.496 --> 50:03.099
Yeah. Okay.

50:11.206 --> 50:12.241
You okay?

50:13.576 --> 50:15.708
- You feeling okay?
- Uh...

50:15.710 --> 50:17.177
You look a little nervous.

50:17.179 --> 50:18.412
Uh, a little.

50:18.414 --> 50:21.282
And we're back in ten...

50:21.284 --> 50:22.715
Just be yourself.

50:22.717 --> 50:24.251
- You'll be great.
- Hmm.

50:24.253 --> 50:28.456
In four,
three, two...

50:28.458 --> 50:32.525
Yesterday, he was a writer with only one book
to his name that few people had heard of.

50:32.527 --> 50:36.563
But today, Simon Hayes is being
talked about all over the country

50:36.565 --> 50:39.766
and across the Internet, and all
because of a single article.

50:39.768 --> 50:41.769
Simon, thank you
for joining us today.

50:41.771 --> 50:43.737
So, tell us what happened.

50:43.739 --> 50:46.307
Uh...

50:46.309 --> 50:49.776
Well, I wrote an...

50:49.778 --> 50:52.612
An article.
Is it hot in here?

50:52.614 --> 50:55.583
Simon, you're not the
first person to criticize these books,

50:55.585 --> 50:57.450
but you've really hit a nerve.

50:57.452 --> 51:01.287
Do you think that's because you
attacked the author personally?

51:01.289 --> 51:03.460
- No way.
- Uh...

51:04.659 --> 51:06.327
Hmm...

51:06.329 --> 51:08.461
Can you get Simon
some water?

51:08.463 --> 51:10.164
So let's take a look
at your title.

51:10.166 --> 51:13.766
The New York Times
Number One Best Sellout.

51:13.768 --> 51:16.806
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's a pretty personal attack, isn't it?

51:17.907 --> 51:21.474
It was... Shakespeare.

51:21.476 --> 51:23.744
- What?
- Shakespeare.

51:23.746 --> 51:26.546
Okay, so I'm not
a Sally fan myself,

51:26.548 --> 51:28.715
but a lot of people
out there really love her.

51:28.717 --> 51:30.284
Well, I love Sally Carmichael.

51:30.286 --> 51:33.253
Great. And you seem intent
on provoking these fans.

51:33.255 --> 51:36.322
Your article implies you understand
exactly how Sally Carmichael

51:36.324 --> 51:40.427
manipulates her audience
and why, that's pretty bold.

51:40.429 --> 51:45.231
Uh, you know, she's an empty shell.
Mmm-hmm.

51:45.233 --> 51:52.438
And just 400 years of
just copies. Just copies.

51:52.440 --> 51:55.943
I'm sorry. I'm just looking at
several people behind the cameras,

51:55.945 --> 51:58.778
including our producer,
who disagree with you.

51:58.780 --> 52:02.650
Looks like we have lot of Sally
Carmichael fans in the studio today.

52:02.652 --> 52:04.751
Oh. Whoa!

52:04.753 --> 52:06.452
Simon, thanks for
being here today.

52:06.454 --> 52:07.887
I hope we weren't
too rough on you.

52:07.889 --> 52:09.889
And now let's turn to the weather...

52:09.891 --> 52:12.693
...where, here, we might
have a chance of moisture.

52:34.817 --> 52:37.418
- Hello?
- Simon, it's Phillip.

52:37.420 --> 52:38.519
Perry Quinn's
executive assistant.

52:38.521 --> 52:40.954
I know who you are, Phillip.
What can I do for you?

52:40.956 --> 52:43.492
Perry wants to know why you
haven't responded to his text.

52:45.393 --> 52:47.561
He only sent one text.

52:47.563 --> 52:49.833
Right. And he wants to know
why you haven't responded to it.

52:50.900 --> 52:53.266
All it said was,
"You dog."

52:53.268 --> 52:56.539
And he wants to know why
you haven't responded to it.

53:03.445 --> 53:04.713
Simon?

53:14.657 --> 53:19.260
You.
You, man, you.

53:19.262 --> 53:21.461
"I don't have anything
planned, I swear."

53:21.463 --> 53:24.298
Except for puking
on live television.

53:24.300 --> 53:25.633
You think I planned that?

53:25.635 --> 53:27.668
No, I think you accidentally
booked the live TV appearance.

53:27.670 --> 53:29.869
Man, it looked so real.

53:29.871 --> 53:32.039
- It was real.
- Everything about you is real, man.

53:32.041 --> 53:34.941
On live TV. I wish
I'd have thought of that.

53:34.943 --> 53:36.543
You want to puke
on live TV?

53:36.545 --> 53:39.345
No, man,
that's your thing.

53:39.347 --> 53:41.615
Now no one else
can do that.

53:41.617 --> 53:43.916
You own that.

53:43.918 --> 53:47.420
You own it. I mean, I've done
a million talk shows and...

53:47.422 --> 53:49.389
I've done anything memorable.

53:49.391 --> 53:52.959
But you got your shot,
and you took it, man.

53:52.961 --> 53:55.028
On live TV.
So they can't stop it.

53:55.030 --> 53:56.929
It's all over YouTube.

53:56.931 --> 54:02.469
Simes, you did something
that will last forever.

54:02.471 --> 54:03.836
I bow to your brilliance.

54:03.838 --> 54:05.539
- Namaste.
- Don't do that. Why you doing that?

54:05.541 --> 54:08.809
- Stop it.
- No. So what's next? Tell me.

54:08.811 --> 54:10.311
You signed your
movie deal, right?

54:10.313 --> 54:11.644
- Oh, you better believe I did.
- Great.

54:11.646 --> 54:13.414
- Yeah.
- That makes me very happy.

54:13.416 --> 54:15.485
You know, you've no idea
how that makes me feel.

54:17.652 --> 54:19.755
So, what's next?

54:21.356 --> 54:23.456
What's next?

54:23.458 --> 54:24.891
- Okay, you just make sure...
- Yeah.

54:24.893 --> 54:26.659
- ...that you do that movie...
- Yeah.

54:26.661 --> 54:29.732
...and when the next thing
happens, you'll know.

54:31.701 --> 54:33.403
How will I know?

54:35.338 --> 54:37.941
You'll know when you know,
because you'll know.

54:40.576 --> 54:42.508
We're gonna make history, man.

54:42.510 --> 54:46.112
Except we won't. Because no one
knows I'm Sally Carmichael.

54:46.114 --> 54:47.613
- Right. Right. Of course.
- Right.

54:47.615 --> 54:49.818
Of course. Yeah. Hmm.

54:52.021 --> 54:53.356
- Perry?
- Hmm?

54:54.757 --> 54:56.222
- No one can ever know.
- I know. I know.

54:56.224 --> 54:59.025
I mean, you know, maybe, maybe,
eventually, historically, in the future?

54:59.027 --> 55:00.360
- No, no, no.
- When we're dead.

55:00.362 --> 55:01.595
- In a time capsule.
- Not eventually.

55:01.597 --> 55:03.030
No. There will be
no time capsule.

55:03.032 --> 55:05.499
- There will be aliens coming.
- No. My publishers signed a contract.

55:05.501 --> 55:07.834
- You signed a contract.
- I've signed a lot of contracts.

55:07.836 --> 55:09.838
I've been sued before. What's
the worse that could happen?

55:10.940 --> 55:13.639
- Was...
- Huh. Yeah.

55:14.943 --> 55:16.809
Got you.
I'm kidding.

55:16.811 --> 55:18.845
Okay? We're in
this together, man.

55:18.847 --> 55:20.713
Come on. You can
count on me, son.

55:20.715 --> 55:23.550
You can count on me. Give me a hug.
Come on. I love you, bro.

55:23.552 --> 55:26.487
Yeah? It's gonna be good.
We can do this.

55:26.489 --> 55:28.856
We can do this.
It's gonna be good.

55:28.858 --> 55:30.824
Good. Good. Good. Huh?

55:30.826 --> 55:32.892
...studio today.

55:32.894 --> 55:34.030
Oh. Whoa.

55:37.132 --> 55:38.367
It could've been worse.

55:40.135 --> 55:41.735
How?

55:41.737 --> 55:43.706
You could've had a stroke.

55:46.708 --> 55:48.077
That worse?

55:51.414 --> 55:52.682
What?

55:54.750 --> 55:56.518
How did all this happen?

55:58.420 --> 55:59.388
Dumb luck.

56:00.623 --> 56:03.126
Dumb, stupid, crazy luck.

56:10.199 --> 56:11.664
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey!

56:11.666 --> 56:14.034
Hi. School. How was it?

56:14.036 --> 56:16.170
Good. Hey, Simon.

56:16.172 --> 56:17.570
Oh. Hey, kiddo.

56:17.572 --> 56:18.875
Mom, you almost ready?

56:20.074 --> 56:21.941
For what?

56:21.943 --> 56:23.476
For soccer.
It's our day.

56:23.478 --> 56:25.179
We're supposed to pick
Avery up in ten minutes.

56:25.181 --> 56:28.518
Right. Go get changed.
I'll go get my purse.

56:34.123 --> 56:37.825
...accepted an unwarranted
concealment of pertinent facts...

56:37.827 --> 56:39.159
- Fire up.
- Therm here,

56:39.161 --> 56:41.461
your Quest Star Gas
energy-wise guy.

56:41.463 --> 56:43.530
A lot of people
were hesitant about

56:43.532 --> 56:45.898
an actor of my stature
releasing a country album.

56:45.900 --> 56:49.570
Well, you're definitely an artist
that's known for taking chances.

56:49.572 --> 56:51.637
I mean, it's just been confirmed

56:51.639 --> 56:55.909
that you'll be playing Alexander
in the big Siren movie adaptation.

56:55.911 --> 56:57.043
That's right.

56:57.045 --> 56:58.945
Alexander the Merman.

56:58.947 --> 57:01.081
Alexander the Merman.

57:01.083 --> 57:03.916
Amazing. I, for one,
can't wait to see you in a fin.

57:03.918 --> 57:07.186
- But what I really wanna know...
- Mmm-hmm.

57:07.188 --> 57:10.057
- ...is the same thing everybody wants to know.
- Mmm-hmm.

57:10.059 --> 57:11.894
Have you met Sally Carmichael?

57:12.961 --> 57:15.662
- I've met Sally.
- Amazing.

57:15.664 --> 57:17.831
What's she like?
What does she look like?

57:17.833 --> 57:19.566
Tell me everything.

57:19.568 --> 57:22.135
Well, you know, she's a lot
different than you'd expect.

57:22.137 --> 57:23.704
Yeah? How so?

57:23.706 --> 57:26.639
Well, for one,
who says she's a she?

57:28.077 --> 57:31.177
Wait. Are you saying that
Sally Carmichael is a man?

57:31.179 --> 57:33.813
- What you doing?
- Maybe I said too much.

57:33.815 --> 57:37.885
No. No, you can't drop something like
that on us and leave us hanging.

57:37.887 --> 57:40.019
- No, I can, really.
- No, you can't.

57:40.021 --> 57:42.889
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Don't you dare.

57:42.891 --> 57:46.862
Maybe she's a he.
Maybe not. How's that?

57:48.130 --> 57:52.164
If Sally Carmichael
is a man, say nothing.

57:52.166 --> 57:56.572
Perry, stop. Stop. Perry?

57:57.706 --> 57:58.938
- I knew it.
- But you...

57:58.940 --> 58:02.108
Heard it? Or didn't
hear it here first.

58:02.110 --> 58:03.709
- Perry Quinn...
- Perry...

58:03.711 --> 58:06.679
...says Sally Carmichael
is a man.

58:06.681 --> 58:08.749
- Is he someone we know?
- No. No. No.

58:08.751 --> 58:11.717
- I... I can't.
- Perry, you can.

58:11.719 --> 58:13.220
- No, you can't.
- No. I really can't.

58:13.222 --> 58:15.789
You have to.
You have to.

58:15.791 --> 58:17.724
No. No. No. No.

58:17.726 --> 58:20.693
You can make history
right here, right now.

58:20.695 --> 58:23.796
- This is huge.
- Oh, shucks, man.

58:23.798 --> 58:25.666
- Come on, Perry.
- Perry?

58:25.668 --> 58:29.001
Okay. Okay.
You wanna know who it is?

58:29.003 --> 58:30.771
- Yes.
- No.

58:30.773 --> 58:32.805
- No.
- You really wanna know who it is?

58:32.807 --> 58:34.708
- Yes!
- No!

58:34.710 --> 58:39.278
It is Simon Hayes.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.717
No!

58:48.056 --> 58:49.623
The guy who
wrote the article?

58:49.625 --> 58:51.325
The very same.

58:51.327 --> 58:54.894
This is amazing.

58:54.896 --> 58:57.764
Hold on. So, you're saying
that Simon Hayes...

58:57.766 --> 59:00.833
- Hello?
- Is this Simon Hayes?

59:00.835 --> 59:02.668
- Yes.
- Hi, Simon.

59:02.670 --> 59:04.972
My name is Dave Sinon
with Buzz magazine.

59:04.974 --> 59:07.874
I'm just calling to confirm the
statement made by Perry Quinn.

59:07.876 --> 59:10.142
Is it true that
you're Sally Carmichael?

59:10.144 --> 59:13.613
But, you know,
he's not a girl. He's a boy.

59:23.958 --> 59:24.927
Hi.

59:26.795 --> 59:30.697
I've had 17 reporters call me
in the last half hour.

59:30.699 --> 59:32.298
17.

59:32.300 --> 59:34.767
I stopped answering
after the first nine or so,

59:34.769 --> 59:36.706
because they all asked me
the same question.

59:38.373 --> 59:40.907
Am I Sally Carmichael?

59:40.909 --> 59:43.744
Of course, you can't be.

59:43.746 --> 59:45.949
Right? Because that's
ridiculous, right?

59:47.315 --> 59:50.883
- Tess, I was...
- Using me for a publicity stunt?

59:50.885 --> 59:53.052
No. No. Not ever.

59:53.054 --> 59:55.287
Then you're not
Sally Carmichael.

59:55.289 --> 59:57.724
You don't know Perry Quinn, and the two of
you haven't been planning this whole thing.

59:57.726 --> 01:00:00.860
No. But... Yes. I mean...

01:00:00.862 --> 01:00:04.398
No. Yes.
I am Sally Carmichael,

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.400
and yes, I have been meeting
with Perry about the movie,

01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:09.670
and yes, I have been keeping
all of this from you.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:11.371
But it was never
a publicity stunt.

01:00:11.373 --> 01:00:13.807
And I was never taking
advantage of you. I swear.

01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:15.842
I mean, why?

01:00:15.844 --> 01:00:18.380
Why would you do all of this?
Why would you do any of it?

01:00:19.947 --> 01:00:23.383
I mean, I wrote the article
because you asked me to.

01:00:23.385 --> 01:00:25.254
And the rest just happened.

01:00:27.989 --> 01:00:31.391
Just, um, stupid,
crazy luck.

01:00:31.393 --> 01:00:34.394
You wrote that article.
You watched me publish it.

01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:36.195
You watched it go viral.

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:38.197
You went on that talk show
to promote it.

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.400
And then...

01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:42.401
And then you kissed me
on that couch,

01:00:42.403 --> 01:00:44.905
and at no point during all
of that did it occur to you

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:47.708
to say to me, "By the way
I'm Sally Carmichael."

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.309
I've never told anyone
I'm Sally Carmichael.

01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:52.012
- You told Perry Quinn.
- But that's different. I had to.

01:00:52.014 --> 01:00:54.414
So is there anything you've
told me that isn't a lie?

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:56.916
Yes. Yes. Everything.

01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:59.251
Except all of this.

01:00:59.253 --> 01:01:04.124
I know the newspaper
isn't important. I get that.

01:01:04.126 --> 01:01:07.094
- But it is really important to me.
- It's important to me, too.

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:10.396
Then you had to have known how stupid
all of this would make me look.

01:01:10.398 --> 01:01:12.300
I didn't know Perry
was going to do that.

01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:14.771
Tess?

01:01:15.971 --> 01:01:19.072
I'm ashamed of
Sally Carmichael.

01:01:19.074 --> 01:01:22.211
I never wanted anyone to know I'm
Sally, because I don't wanna be Sally.

01:01:25.914 --> 01:01:28.251
You signed that book
for Andie, didn't you?

01:01:29.885 --> 01:01:31.220
And you let her
think it was real.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.887
It is real.

01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:36.490
She's just a kid.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.795
Simon, what's the
matter with you?

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:43.766
I need you to leave.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.334
Yeah. Okay.

01:01:48.336 --> 01:01:51.940
- Just hear me out.
- No. I can't. I can't do this. It's too much.

01:01:53.108 --> 01:01:55.745
Please. Just... Just leave.

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:20.566
- Can I help you?
- Oh. Hey, Simon.

01:02:20.568 --> 01:02:22.802
I'm with the Herald. I was hoping
I could speak with you about...

01:02:22.804 --> 01:02:24.371
No.

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:26.141
Hey, it's a good chance for you
to tell your side of the story.

01:03:07.983 --> 01:03:10.119
This is Tess Perkins.
Please leave a message.

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:33.874
Okay.

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.041
Oh. Hey, good girl.
Hey, it's a good girl.

01:03:36.043 --> 01:03:37.476
That's a good... No. No!

01:03:37.478 --> 01:03:39.112
That's a bad girl.

01:03:39.114 --> 01:03:41.447
Bad girl. Ah. Ah!

01:03:41.449 --> 01:03:44.150
- Bad girl. Ah. Come on.
- Mommy!

01:03:44.152 --> 01:03:47.519
It's okay. It's okay.
It's testing. It's fine. Ow!

01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:50.090
Stop that. Ahhh!

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.894
Ah. Okay.

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:57.664
According
to Perry Quinn,

01:03:57.666 --> 01:04:00.300
Simon's the real author
of the series.

01:04:00.302 --> 01:04:02.135
So the whole
thing's a big joke?

01:04:02.137 --> 01:04:03.637
Well, I could
have told you that.

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:06.005
We're still
figuring all of this out,

01:04:06.007 --> 01:04:10.409
but it looks like Simon Hayes is both
the guy who trashed Sally Carmichael,

01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:13.146
- and Sally Carmichael.
- That's actually pretty hilarious.

01:04:13.148 --> 01:04:15.148
Well, the fans
of the series aren't laughing.

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.516
I mean, some of them say
they're gonna boycott the movie.

01:04:17.518 --> 01:04:19.920
There is even
an online petition

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:22.255
to boycott the Valley Voice,
the paper that published...

01:04:22.257 --> 01:04:23.657
Move. Move.

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:26.592
Seeing here that the
petition appeared online last night,

01:04:26.594 --> 01:04:29.229
and it's already gotten
over 10,000 signatures.

01:04:29.231 --> 01:04:31.998
Wow. I didn't know that
many people even read the Voice.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.333
I don't think they did
before Simon Hayes showed up,

01:04:34.335 --> 01:04:36.638
and I doubt that many ever
are gonna read it again.

01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:39.572
Hi. I need to see Perry.

01:04:39.574 --> 01:04:41.641
Oh, I'm sorry. There's no
one here under that name.

01:04:41.643 --> 01:04:44.543
No. No. Isambard.
Whatever the password is.

01:04:44.545 --> 01:04:46.079
Thanks.

01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:47.646
Unfortunately, he's requested
not to be disturbed,

01:04:47.648 --> 01:04:50.215
but if you'd like me
to leave a message...

01:04:50.217 --> 01:04:51.985
Hey. Hey!

01:04:51.987 --> 01:04:53.389
You can't just
go up there.

01:04:54.389 --> 01:04:55.625
Stop me.

01:05:10.572 --> 01:05:13.309
Hi, I'm Phillip. Perry
Quinn's executive assistant.

01:05:16.244 --> 01:05:18.510
Ah. Okay, before you
say anything,

01:05:18.512 --> 01:05:20.280
I can see you're upset.

01:05:20.282 --> 01:05:23.349
But I want you to know I think
it's totally understandable.

01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:26.286
- What, you think?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

01:05:26.288 --> 01:05:29.356
Oh, I can sense your
negative energy, man.

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:32.559
There's no reason why we can't have
a positive dialogue, you know.

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.327
I said some things.
You said some things.

01:05:34.329 --> 01:05:36.528
No, you said some things.
I didn't say anything.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:38.565
You're right. But it was
gonna come out eventually.

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:41.066
- How?
- In one way or another.

01:05:41.068 --> 01:05:43.302
It's all right, Vinny.
You can let him go.

01:05:43.304 --> 01:05:46.305
You know what? No.
It was one way. You.

01:05:46.307 --> 01:05:49.075
Now I realize you live
in this little bubble

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:51.711
where none of your actions
have any real consequences,

01:05:51.713 --> 01:05:53.780
but they do affect other people.

01:05:53.782 --> 01:05:56.048
Hey. So the cat's out of
the bag. You should be happy.

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:59.052
- I did you a favor.
- How? How is this a favor?

01:05:59.054 --> 01:06:01.621
Well, you know, you can finally start
enjoying this. Come on, Simes.

01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:03.555
This is fun.

01:06:03.557 --> 01:06:06.392
I don't know if you've noticed, but
being famous is kind of awesome.

01:06:06.394 --> 01:06:10.095
Oh, I'm not famous.
I'm universally hated.

01:06:10.097 --> 01:06:13.333
Oh, I get that. I get that. You know, you
should've seen how the nerds freaked out

01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:15.300
when we tried to
reboot Quantum Leap.

01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:17.237
It'll pass. I promise.

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:18.507
What about Tess?

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:21.641
What's Tess?

01:06:21.643 --> 01:06:25.577
Tess is the woman who owns the
newspaper that ran the editorial.

01:06:25.579 --> 01:06:28.113
She's a good person. She
doesn't deserve any of this.

01:06:28.115 --> 01:06:31.050
- Look, we all played our part.
- No. She didn't know.

01:06:31.052 --> 01:06:32.786
- She didn't know?
- No.

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:34.487
And now she thinks
I exploited her

01:06:34.489 --> 01:06:36.789
and made a joke
out of her newspaper.

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:38.825
- You kinda did, right?
- Well, yeah.

01:06:38.827 --> 01:06:41.760
But I was gonna tell her
and...

01:06:41.762 --> 01:06:44.132
We were talking about
what you did.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.066
I think I'm falling
in love with her.

01:06:47.068 --> 01:06:49.469
And now she thinks I'm a liar,
because I'm a liar.

01:06:49.471 --> 01:06:52.507
Oh, that's rough.
I'm sorry, man.

01:06:55.844 --> 01:06:57.679
It's gonna be all right. So...

01:06:59.481 --> 01:07:01.414
What's next?

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:04.818
I wanna go back to my old life
where no one knew who I was.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.253
- But I can't do that, can I?
- You certainly can.

01:07:07.255 --> 01:07:08.822
- Hmm.
- We can fix this.

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:11.090
- Great. How?
- I don't know.

01:07:11.092 --> 01:07:14.594
But it's exciting, right?
It's a challenge.

01:07:14.596 --> 01:07:16.595
Did you know, in Japan,

01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:20.166
they use the same word
for "crisis" and "opportunity"?

01:07:20.168 --> 01:07:23.570
Or maybe it's in China, or ancient...
Let me find out.

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:26.238
I'm going home.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.575
Simes, hey, you know, they told
me I couldn't make a movie

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:32.311
where the detective and the serial
killer were the same person.

01:07:32.313 --> 01:07:34.179
And I think we know
how that turned out.

01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:37.450
$400 million domestic.
$1.2 billion worldwide.

01:07:37.452 --> 01:07:40.887
This is nothing. Simes, we got this.
Come on.

01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:44.157
The only public
footage available of Simon Hayes

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:48.595
since the announcement last night was caught
outside of Hayes' house, this morning.

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:50.429
Let's see that again.

01:07:50.431 --> 01:07:51.664
- Ah.
- Ooh.

01:07:51.666 --> 01:07:53.733
Guys, I'm so sorry.

01:07:53.735 --> 01:07:56.401
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before
this, but you understand why, right?

01:07:56.403 --> 01:07:58.905
- Right?
- Sure, of course. I understand.

01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:01.740
You know, it is
a little weird,

01:08:01.742 --> 01:08:04.510
this whole time,
and we never knew.

01:08:04.512 --> 01:08:05.912
What are you gonna do now?

01:08:05.914 --> 01:08:08.180
I don't know.
What can I do?

01:08:08.182 --> 01:08:11.351
So this whole time I could've been telling
people that I know Sally Carmichael?

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.619
This whole time?

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.653
There's big question
nobody is addressing.

01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:17.456
I'm just gonna
put it out there.

01:08:17.457 --> 01:08:19.526
You gotta be, like,
super-rich, right?

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:22.562
- Brad!
- What've you been doing with all that money?

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:25.898
You couldn't have bought yourself a
bigger house? A nicer car? Something?

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:29.434
And you know Perry Quinn?
You guys are, like, friends?

01:08:29.435 --> 01:08:32.237
Sort of. At least, I think
he thinks so. I don't...

01:08:32.238 --> 01:08:35.207
Do you think you could get him to, like,
pick me up after school sometime,

01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:37.910
just once, so I could
blow everyone's minds?

01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:40.247
I'm sorry. I've just got to
circle back around here.

01:08:42.684 --> 01:08:46.188
How much money are we talking about
here, man? Just ballpark it for me.

01:08:49.323 --> 01:08:50.725
It... Uh...

01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:18.317
I saw your dad
on the street yesterday.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.421
I gave him a dollar
and said hi for you.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.723
Scored.

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:26.426
Oh, my.

01:09:28.261 --> 01:09:29.698
Excuse me, girls.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.435
I'm looking for Andie Perkins.
One of you know her?

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:40.408
Thanks.

01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:42.377
Andie?

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:44.412
Andie?

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:50.685
Hey.

01:09:52.252 --> 01:09:53.453
I'm Perry.

01:09:55.323 --> 01:09:56.292
Do you have a second?

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:58.260
Yeah?

01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:07.469
What?

01:10:14.542 --> 01:10:17.309
It's smart to do
simple things. Huh.

01:10:17.311 --> 01:10:20.280
This is the first public
statement from Simon Hayes

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:23.915
since the now-famous allegation
that he's the real author

01:10:23.917 --> 01:10:25.820
of the popular Siren franchise.

01:10:52.447 --> 01:10:55.417
And it looks like Simon Hayes is
stepping up to the microphones now.

01:11:01.555 --> 01:11:02.724
Uh...

01:11:04.591 --> 01:11:05.560
Hello.

01:11:08.529 --> 01:11:11.032
So, um...

01:11:12.399 --> 01:11:15.003
Uh... I'm...

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:20.106
Yeah. I'm...

01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:22.642
I'm Sally Carmichael.

01:11:22.644 --> 01:11:25.847
And I wrote the Siren novels.

01:11:27.582 --> 01:11:29.415
For the fans of the books...

01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:33.619
- It's Perry Quinn.
- ...I just want to say, I've been a real jerk,

01:11:33.621 --> 01:11:36.656
and I'm sorry.

01:11:36.658 --> 01:11:39.659
What a guy.
What a guy.

01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:45.367
I... Sally Carmichael is my way
of protecting my privacy, and it...

01:11:46.533 --> 01:11:48.835
It grew into something else.

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.969
Wow.

01:11:50.971 --> 01:11:52.073
Um...

01:11:53.774 --> 01:11:55.310
Thank you.

01:11:56.543 --> 01:11:57.910
Uh...

01:11:57.912 --> 01:12:00.812
This way.

01:12:00.814 --> 01:12:03.449
I just wanna make
one thing clear.

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:05.921
No one at the Valley Voice,

01:12:07.622 --> 01:12:10.623
the newspaper that
printed my editorial,

01:12:10.625 --> 01:12:16.696
was a part of any deception or had
anything to do with any of this.

01:12:16.698 --> 01:12:18.865
Really good.

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:22.535
Please don't punish the paper
for something that I did.

01:12:22.537 --> 01:12:23.505
Okay.

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:28.473
Tess Perkins,
the owner of the Valley Voice,

01:12:28.475 --> 01:12:31.177
she didn't even know
who I really was.

01:12:31.179 --> 01:12:32.945
I wasn't honest with her.

01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:37.051
At the same time,
I was deceiving everyone else.

01:12:40.721 --> 01:12:43.688
I don't know if the fans
are ever gonna forgive me.

01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:47.727
And, frankly,
I don't expect them to.

01:12:47.729 --> 01:12:49.565
I don't know
if I deserve that.

01:12:50.864 --> 01:12:52.367
But...

01:12:56.003 --> 01:12:57.072
Okay.

01:13:04.912 --> 01:13:06.381
Oh.

01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:09.752
Tess?

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:14.923
If you're watching,
and I really hope you are...

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.029
I just wanna tell you...

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:28.867
Sorry, folks. It looks like we're
having some trouble with our live feed.

01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:32.839
Uh, we'll get you back
out there as soon as we...

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:35.741
- Got it?
- Somebody call 911.

01:13:35.743 --> 01:13:38.143
- There's some sort of accident.
- Don't touch him.

01:13:38.145 --> 01:13:39.678
- Pick it up.
- Check his pulse.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.546
Could you tell us
what's going on?

01:13:41.548 --> 01:13:45.250
Okay. For those of you still
watching, I have some breaking news.

01:13:45.252 --> 01:13:48.487
Simon Hayes has been
struck by lightning.

01:13:48.489 --> 01:13:50.555
I'm told that he's unconscious...

01:13:50.557 --> 01:13:52.560
Paramedics are on the way.

01:13:53.694 --> 01:13:54.796
Genius!

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:03.172
Simon? Simon?

01:14:05.206 --> 01:14:07.543
- Tess?
- Simon?

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:11.480
Simon. Hey, buddy.

01:14:13.046 --> 01:14:15.615
Come on, Sime.
You're all right.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.983
- Where am I?
- Oh, you're in the hospital.

01:14:17.985 --> 01:14:20.285
- What happened?
- Oh, you were struck by lightning.

01:14:20.287 --> 01:14:22.854
- What?
- You were struck by lightning.

01:14:22.856 --> 01:14:26.858
On TV, and it was awesome.
The whole thing is online.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.995
When you slow down
the footage like I did,

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:32.098
you can see the exact moment
the bolt hit your head. Zap!

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:35.166
Dude, you are so lucky.

01:14:35.168 --> 01:14:37.102
To be alive.

01:14:37.104 --> 01:14:38.771
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what I meant.

01:14:38.773 --> 01:14:41.072
Oh, by the way, there's some
people waiting for you,

01:14:41.074 --> 01:14:44.779
and the doctors won't let them in, because
they're not immediate family, you know.

01:14:48.015 --> 01:14:49.214
How did you get in here?

01:14:49.216 --> 01:14:52.117
Oh, no one ever stops me
from going anywhere.

01:14:55.923 --> 01:14:57.322
He's okay.

01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:07.101
Hello, Utah.

01:15:08.636 --> 01:15:09.936
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.139
Hey, uh...

01:15:12.573 --> 01:15:14.175
I got a surprise for you.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:23.952
Told you.

01:15:25.219 --> 01:15:26.188
Told me what?

01:15:27.588 --> 01:15:28.955
Lightning.

01:15:38.733 --> 01:15:40.202
Are we okay?

01:15:43.003 --> 01:15:43.971
No.

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.011
But give it some time.

01:16:28.248 --> 01:16:29.283
Hi.

01:16:30.417 --> 01:16:31.586
Hi.

01:16:33.654 --> 01:16:34.822
Take the hat off.

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:42.965
Put the hat back on.

01:16:45.198 --> 01:16:48.034
- Oh, hey, Simon.
- Hey.

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:49.070
Oh, hang on.

01:16:56.277 --> 01:16:59.245
Hey. You don't
want it anymore?

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:01.717
Of course I want it.
But I want you to sign it.

01:17:12.859 --> 01:17:14.161
- How's that?
- Good.

01:17:15.296 --> 01:17:17.129
- Bye, Mom.
- Have fun.

01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:18.867
Bye.

01:17:21.135 --> 01:17:22.704
See? I told you.

01:17:27.408 --> 01:17:29.811
I've been so busy today,
I skipped lunch.

01:17:31.145 --> 01:17:32.745
You hungry?

01:17:51.332 --> 01:17:53.232
Hey. Excuse me.

01:17:53.234 --> 01:17:54.703
Aren't you Sally Carmichael?

01:17:55.869 --> 01:17:58.439
Uh... Yep. I am.

01:18:00.408 --> 01:18:01.710
You suck!

01:18:08.048 --> 01:18:09.348
Give it some time.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.789
No one would
ever accept us.

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.358
Above the tide or below, you
could never survive in my world.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.062
And your people would
destroy me as they have

01:18:57.064 --> 01:18:58.798
with everything
that's unlike them.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.500
But I can protect you.
We can protect each other.

01:19:01.502 --> 01:19:03.468
I can't put you
through that. I won't.

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:04.939
Alexander?

01:19:06.474 --> 01:19:08.107
Do you love me?

01:19:08.109 --> 01:19:09.275
Don't ask me that.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:10.979
Just tell me
what's in your heart.

01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:18.519
Actually...

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:23.859
my heart is right here.

01:19:30.965 --> 01:19:35.034
I can feel it beating.
It's so strong.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:37.468
You and I are so different.

01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:39.938
We might be from
different places

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:42.441
and our hearts might
be in different places,

01:19:42.443 --> 01:19:47.882
but what matters is that we're right
here, right now, in the same place.
