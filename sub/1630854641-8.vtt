[Vernon] <i>There's a dredge</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:09.667
<i>They're dead in the water.</i>

00:09.667 --> 00:10.967
<i>No power.</i>

00:10.967 --> 00:14.767
Right now,
we're the only hope he's got.

00:39.467 --> 00:43.166
John, my engines are swamping.

[Vernon] <i>Abandon ship!</i>

01:02.000 --> 01:06.266
[narrator] <i>In Nome,</i>
<i>the final days of summer</i>
<i>continue to slip away,</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:11.166
<i>as an early winter storm</i>

01:12.400 --> 01:14.066
<i>And in the harbor...</i>

01:14.066 --> 01:16.567
[Shawn] We're gonna pile up
as much gold as we can,

01:16.567 --> 01:21.367
dig until the weather turns
pretty flat out there
right now.

01:23.100 --> 01:27.100
[narrator] <i>Shawn Pomrenke</i>
<i>is determined to get while</i>
<i>the getting is still good.</i>

01:28.567 --> 01:31.767
<i>Hoping to stay one step</i>
<i>ahead of Mother Nature.</i>

01:34.600 --> 01:39.166
[Shawn] Snow in the mountains
and ice in the mornings

01:39.166 --> 01:43.166
that's your sign
the season's coming
to an end.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.767
Running out of time.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.200
We got some nasty
weather coming in,
whipping winds,

01:50.266 --> 01:53.667
dropping temperatures,
unmineable
for the whole fleet,

01:53.667 --> 01:55.367
<i>even this old girl.</i>

01:55.367 --> 01:57.467
<i>The waves are going</i>
<i>to get too big for the</i> Myrtle,

01:57.467 --> 01:59.367
but hopefully,
there's a big enough window

01:59.367 --> 02:01.567
that we can do some
damage before it hits.

02:09.567 --> 02:11.367
[Shawn] Today,
we're treasure hunting.

02:11.367 --> 02:13.867
We only got a few hours here,

02:13.867 --> 02:18.500
and I'm impatient for that
box to turn yellow.

02:18.567 --> 02:22.500
So, I want to find a spot
that's going to just knock
it out of the park.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.667
I'm looking for that cheesy,
easy cheesy band.

02:35.667 --> 02:36.700
[Shawn speaking]

02:45.100 --> 02:46.567
[Shawn] There's no gold
in the pan.

02:46.567 --> 02:50.967
But my gut feeling
with the way the material
looks says to dig it,

02:50.967 --> 02:52.500
so we're going to dig it.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.467
[Shawn] <i>Even though we're not</i>
<i>seeing gold in these pans,</i>

03:17.467 --> 03:20.200
<i>I'm going to put</i>
<i>all my eggs into this basket.</i>

03:20.266 --> 03:22.100
I've been doing
this long enough,

03:22.100 --> 03:23.800
I know
what paydirt looks like.

03:25.066 --> 03:27.500
<i>I'm even willing to risk</i>
<i>the whole day on it.</i>

03:27.567 --> 03:31.667
<i>If I'm wrong,</i>
<i>it could kill my chances</i>
<i>to make it to 3,000 ounces.</i>

03:32.467 --> 03:33.867
Pressure's on.

03:33.867 --> 03:35.400
Running out of time.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.567
[narrator] <i>While</i>
<i>Shawn gets to work...</i>

03:44.900 --> 03:46.367
<i>10 miles east...</i>

03:50.767 --> 03:52.400
[grunting] She's moving!

03:57.066 --> 03:59.200
[narrator] <i>Even though</i>
<i>it's late in the season,</i>

03:59.266 --> 04:02.467
<i>it's the dawn of a new era</i>

04:06.266 --> 04:07.467
Well, here...

04:07.767 --> 04:09.200
Whoo!

04:09.266 --> 04:10.467
[man] Stop all that.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.900
Woo!

04:14.367 --> 04:17.300
[Zeke] <i>I got my brother Gabe</i>
<i>and our friend, Shem and Nate</i>
<i>out of the compound,</i>

04:17.367 --> 04:19.166
<i>and we're up</i>
<i>for a new challenge.</i>

04:19.166 --> 04:21.100
<i>Out with the old</i>
<i>and in with the new.</i>

04:21.166 --> 04:23.000
<i>We're taking the</i> Golden Dawn
<i>out of the water</i>

04:23.066 --> 04:24.567
<i>and we're breaking her down.</i>

04:24.567 --> 04:27.000
I'm salvaging some
of the parts for the winter.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.667
[bleep]

04:28.667 --> 04:30.600
Up, go...

04:38.767 --> 04:40.867
[Zeke] <i>And now,</i>
<i>we're switching over</i>
<i>to the</i> Havilah.

04:40.867 --> 04:43.266
<i>At the start of the season,</i>
<i>we made a deal</i>
<i>with Shawn that</i>

04:43.266 --> 04:45.367
if we can make it seaworthy,
we could take it out

04:45.367 --> 04:47.100
to Tomcod and run
it out there.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.700
<i>This will be a game-changer.</i>

04:48.767 --> 04:51.166
<i>It's a top-flight dredge</i>
<i>with a high-end system and,</i>

04:51.166 --> 04:53.367
<i>most importantly,</i>
<i>it has a 10-inch hose on it.</i>

04:53.367 --> 04:54.767
<i>It's the big league</i>
<i>right there.</i>

04:54.767 --> 04:57.100
It's a colossal
amount of difference.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.200
If I go out on the <i>Havilah</i>
and it looks like

04:59.266 --> 05:01.066
we can pull some
really good numbers

05:01.066 --> 05:02.266
and have like
a really good cleanup,

05:02.266 --> 05:04.166
it's going to make me
think that maybe... maybe

05:04.166 --> 05:08.667
I need to, like, find a way
to segue into, uh...

05:08.667 --> 05:10.867
using a bigger boat.

05:10.867 --> 05:13.367
I went out this summer
thinking that the gold,

05:13.367 --> 05:14.867
there's going to be
more gold

05:14.867 --> 05:17.066
that was going
to be acceptable
for a six-inch dredge,

05:17.066 --> 05:18.867
and I didn't find a lot
of that, uh,

05:18.867 --> 05:21.900
but I did find a lot of places
where the gold would be

05:21.967 --> 05:23.567
really profitable
for a 10-inch dredge.

05:23.567 --> 05:27.066
So, the four of us,
me and Gabe
and Shem and Nate

05:27.066 --> 05:28.967
are just going to, like,
give it a real nice,

05:28.967 --> 05:30.467
hard run on that
10-inch dredge,

05:30.467 --> 05:32.567
and I want to see
what it can do.

05:32.567 --> 05:36.700
I was aiming for 50 ounces,
but I'm only sitting
at about 20 right now,

05:36.767 --> 05:38.367
and the summer is almost over.

05:38.367 --> 05:40.166
-There we go.
-There we go, gentlemen.

05:40.166 --> 05:43.367
[Zeke] <i>Getting</i>
<i>on the</i> Havilah <i>is probably</i>
<i>the key to hitting my mark.</i>

05:43.367 --> 05:45.000
<i>The bummer is,</i>
<i>is that there's supposed</i>

05:45.000 --> 05:47.200
<i>to be giant swells</i>
<i>headed our way.</i>

05:47.266 --> 05:48.867
And these swells
could be so bad that

05:48.867 --> 05:50.166
they could keep us
off the water,

05:50.166 --> 05:51.667
which would be a huge
bummer because

05:51.667 --> 05:54.800
I'm really looking forward
to seeing what this dredge
could do for us.

05:54.867 --> 05:58.000
Man, I want to go, um,
if it's calm, you know
what I mean?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.767
I don't know.
That swell's just weird.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.900
It's like this north wind
should be right putting
it down and it's not.

06:02.967 --> 06:05.467
Swell's determined
by tides, right?

06:05.467 --> 06:07.567
No, I think that swell
is a big weather system

06:07.567 --> 06:09.867
that's happening like
out in the Bering Sea
somewhere,

06:09.867 --> 06:11.166
there's a big storm out there.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.400
It's just like pushing up
this big [bleep] swell.

06:13.467 --> 06:16.400
At this point with like,
what the weather's doing
and how spotty it is,

06:16.467 --> 06:18.100
we just like,
we look at the weather report

06:18.166 --> 06:21.166
and then look at it out there
and make a judgment call.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.166
You know, we'll just
keep an eye on it.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.600
For sure.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.467
Should just did some
witchcraft and like,

06:26.467 --> 06:31.300
sacrifice a small
goat to appeal
to the gods of weather.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.467
-[Zeke] I know a guy.
-[Nate] You got a guy there?

06:33.467 --> 06:34.667
You got a goat guy?

06:34.667 --> 06:36.100
[Zeke] We got a goat guy.

06:42.567 --> 06:43.900
[narrator]
<i>Back at the harbor...</i>

06:45.100 --> 06:46.567
This better [bleep]
work right now.

06:46.567 --> 06:49.667
This is my last ditch effort
to make this work.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.500
[narrator]
<i>Kris Kelly is ready to test</i>
<i>his ailing mistress,</i>

06:52.567 --> 06:56.266
<i>and the rest of his season</i>
<i>rests in the balance.</i>

06:56.266 --> 06:58.100
[Kris]
I just hope he fixes it.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.200
Fingers crossed.

06:59.266 --> 07:01.100
So I paid this guy,
Kris and his wife,

07:01.166 --> 07:04.266
<i>to fly up from California</i>
<i>to get this excavator running.</i>

07:04.266 --> 07:07.867
Nobody else can figure out
what's wrong with this
electrical problem.

07:07.867 --> 07:09.667
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>this is costing me a ton.</i>

07:09.667 --> 07:11.467
<i>But if he can't figure out</i>
<i>how to make this work,</i>

07:11.467 --> 07:13.567
I won't be making
any money at all.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.567
It's big risk, high reward.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.400
Kris, got news for you.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.667
I want you to go ahead
and try turning that key.

07:23.567 --> 07:25.600
[engine starts]

07:25.667 --> 07:27.767
What do you think
of that, huh?

07:27.767 --> 07:29.567
Yeah.
That started like nothing.

07:29.567 --> 07:30.967
Do you hear that?

07:32.800 --> 07:35.467
That's [bleep]
purring like a kitten.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.867
Well, he fixed.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.100
Yeah, baby.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.266
Yes, finally, I thought
this was never going
to start again.

07:45.266 --> 07:48.300
<i>This excavator was going</i>
<i>to be a giant heap</i>
<i>of rusting metal</i>

07:48.367 --> 07:50.066
<i>on the Nome shore.</i>

07:50.066 --> 07:51.567
But now
we're back in business.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.066
Come on, let's go.

07:54.066 --> 07:55.700
We've got everything up
and running.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.567
Today's the day,
the first day of the rest
of the season.

07:58.567 --> 07:59.667
No excuses.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.066
We're getting gold
no matter what.

08:02.066 --> 08:05.600
So, we owe 125,000
in just a few days,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.767
or this whole operation
is going to tank.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.266
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>I'm not even close.</i>

08:09.266 --> 08:12.000
<i>So it's like a mad dash</i>
<i>to pull this off this summer.</i>

08:12.000 --> 08:14.367
<i>I'm even taking this guy,</i>
<i>Kris, with me mining</i>

08:14.367 --> 08:16.700
<i>just to make sure</i>
<i>this doesn't break down again.</i>

08:16.767 --> 08:18.600
I'm not taking any chances.

08:18.667 --> 08:21.200
I got Kris and his wife
here with me.

08:21.266 --> 08:22.834
We're going to get
out there

08:22.834 --> 08:25.567
and I'm sure they're going
to have a great vacation
out there on the water,

08:25.567 --> 08:28.200
but I'm really bringing them
in case [bleep] goes bad.

08:28.266 --> 08:30.066
Any problems
with the excavator,

08:30.066 --> 08:31.567
we're going to handle
it right away.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.000
We're ready to go.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.667
Yeah.
Let's do this.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.767
We're going to push hard.

08:40.767 --> 08:42.100
We're going to make
this happen,

08:42.100 --> 08:44.867
and we're still going
to get at least 200
or 300 ounces

08:44.867 --> 08:48.000
before the [bleep] season
is over. Watch.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.367
We're going to call Kevin,
tell him the good news,

08:50.367 --> 08:53.500
because if anybody needs
good news, it's Kevin.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.266
Yo, buddy, can you hear me?

08:55.266 --> 08:56.767
[Kevin speaking on phone]

08:57.767 --> 08:59.567
Hey, we're going
on the water today.

08:59.567 --> 09:01.166
Everything's fixed.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.600
[Kevin speaking on phone]

09:03.667 --> 09:05.166
We're going to get some gold.

09:05.166 --> 09:06.600
[Kevin speaking on phone]

09:08.400 --> 09:09.867
Kevin is happy.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.066
You know,
it's always funny

09:11.066 --> 09:13.667
when you start making money,
everybody loves you again.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.300
So the good news
is this albatross is working,

09:16.367 --> 09:18.000
<i>and we can finally get gold.</i>

09:18.066 --> 09:19.867
<i>The bad news,</i>
<i>the storm is coming</i>

09:19.867 --> 09:21.867
<i>and it's going to knock</i>
<i>us off the water.</i>

09:21.867 --> 09:24.500
So it's a race today
to get as much material
in the box

09:24.567 --> 09:25.767
before we get booted.

09:25.767 --> 09:28.700
I need this excavator
to start paying for itself.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.367
I've got people
with families.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.166
I can't let everybody
go bankrupt.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.667
[man speaking]

09:44.200 --> 09:45.400
[man] Hey, we're good.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.867
Yeah!

09:55.367 --> 09:57.567
It all started
and warmed up for you.

09:57.567 --> 09:58.867
[James speaking]

09:58.867 --> 10:01.166
[James] We've left
the excavator running
this whole time.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.100
Hopefully, this thing
lasts us a couple of hours,
a couple of days.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.367
Who knows?

10:14.567 --> 10:16.266
James is in the excavator.

10:16.266 --> 10:17.567
We're going to start
making gold,

10:17.567 --> 10:19.967
and all I got to say,
it's about [bleep] time.

10:27.767 --> 10:28.900
[man speaking]

10:28.967 --> 10:30.367
Yeah, baby.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.266
[Kris speaking]

10:34.700 --> 10:39.467
First test pan of the day,
40 colors,
great [bleep] start.

10:42.967 --> 10:44.567
[machine beeping]

10:47.266 --> 10:48.700
[James speaking]

10:50.867 --> 10:52.567
[Kris] Oh, that's not good.

10:53.767 --> 10:55.200
What's the matter?

10:56.100 --> 10:57.900
[James speaking]

11:05.900 --> 11:07.767
Try to idle this bitch up.

11:11.367 --> 11:13.266
It's not idling up at all?

11:17.367 --> 11:20.100
We're having problems
with the communication again.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.667
All right.
So I got Kris brought it.

11:28.667 --> 11:29.900
He's going to do
the best he can,

11:29.967 --> 11:33.166
but he's not
a [bleep] magician.

11:33.166 --> 11:36.567
[Kris] I don't understand it.
It worked [bleep].

11:38.467 --> 11:40.867
The problem
is we don't know
what the problem is.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.200
That's the problem.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.900
[machine beeping]

11:49.967 --> 11:51.400
[Kris] Oh, you [bleep]
sack of [bleep]!

11:53.266 --> 11:55.767
If this excavator
doesn't fire back up,

11:55.767 --> 11:57.767
it's in a really [bleep]
position

11:57.767 --> 12:00.266
and I won't even be
able to dock up the harbor.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.600
It's all bad.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.767
[bleep] man,
one thing
or [bleep] another.

12:08.467 --> 12:10.900
What [bleep] joke, man.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.600
[Vernon] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>how long this is going</i>
<i>to last.</i>

12:20.667 --> 12:22.367
<i>Nobody does.</i>

12:22.367 --> 12:24.700
<i>These weather forecasts,</i>
<i>you can pretty much</i>
<i>wipe your butt on them,</i>

12:24.767 --> 12:27.100
<i>for all the good they are.</i>

12:27.100 --> 12:30.266
[narrator] <i>Rather than</i>
<i>playing chicken</i>
<i>with the approaching storm,</i>

12:30.266 --> 12:33.700
<i>Vernon Adkison</i>
<i>isn't taking any chances.</i>

12:34.800 --> 12:36.367
[Vernon] <i>I've been</i>
<i>through these periods,</i>

12:36.367 --> 12:38.500
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how many times up here.</i>

12:38.567 --> 12:40.066
<i>Extremely frustrating.</i>

12:40.066 --> 12:42.367
There's nothing worse
than being stuck up here

12:42.367 --> 12:44.767
hemorrhaging money
and nothing's coming in.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.166
We're up here
to gold mine,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.700
but the weather
doesn't let you do it.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.767
Not a damn thing
you can do about it.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.700
So, there's no sense
in even going out.

12:53.767 --> 12:57.667
<i>The forecast is terrible,</i>
<i>particularly</i>
<i>for out on Claim 56.</i>

12:57.667 --> 13:00.467
We've had a few hiccups
with the gold ship
this season.

13:00.467 --> 13:03.300
I can't risk getting
her knocked out right now.

13:03.367 --> 13:06.400
<i>I've got to keep her healthy</i>
<i>for the last push.</i>

13:06.467 --> 13:08.266
<i>So it pains me not to be</i>
<i>out there,</i>

13:08.266 --> 13:12.400
but it's a decision
I made as a captain
and that's it.

13:12.467 --> 13:14.300
It's part of the drill
up here,

13:14.367 --> 13:18.000
this happens frequently,
believe me.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.367
Let's go down
to Airport Pizza,

13:20.367 --> 13:23.667
get some coffee,
get warmed up.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.367
It is what it is.

[Emily] Yeah, or I,

14:04.266 --> 14:06.667
A goal this season
is 250 ounces,

14:06.667 --> 14:08.200

we're going to dive
in with Jeff.

14:16.166 --> 14:17.967
But we got some
swells coming in,

14:17.967 --> 14:19.600

14:39.967 --> 14:44.300
I'm just looking this way
because the diver
is changing his clothes.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.767
I've already seen him
naked once.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.800

Good old <i>Reaper</i> right here.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.567
It's small,

Reaper Nation,
really there hasn't been
a nation,

16:43.467 --> 16:45.367
there's only just been
the <i>Reaper</i> really.

16:45.367 --> 16:48.066
My brother brought up
this specialist guy to see

16:48.066 --> 16:50.266
if they could get
something running.

16:50.266 --> 16:52.600
They're not going to get
nothing up and running.

16:52.667 --> 16:57.000
So I'm taking my buddy,
Daniel and Anthony
from that crew,

16:57.066 --> 17:00.066

to go dredging.

17:00.066 --> 17:02.867
Oh, I can see right
over your head,
dude, don't worry.

17:02.867 --> 17:05.600
That's what I love about
working with short people.

17:15.266 --> 17:16.900
<i>So it can't only be</i>
<i>me diving,</i>

17:16.967 --> 17:19.066
<i>so I'm going to put</i>
<i>two new guys through</i>

17:20.867 --> 17:23.567
<i>My buddy, Daniel,</i>

17:23.567 --> 17:25.700

17:27.767 --> 17:29.767

if they can impress me.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.266
Hey, boys and girls...

17:39.266 --> 17:40.567
let the fun begin.

17:41.967 --> 17:44.367
We just got to put
it all right [bleep]
right now.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.667
I'm bringing them
to the spot,

17:45.667 --> 17:46.800
where I already found gold.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.900
So there's no excuse
if they strike out.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.166
<i>Daniel's up first.</i>

17:50.166 --> 17:53.300

18:22.100 --> 18:25.066
And of course,
it's a dumpster fire
right off the bat.

Par for the course
this season.

Tough case
we're having right now.

He has a fat face
and an extra-large helmet.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.867
Hood's not working for him.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.500
[Andy speaking].

18:42.800 --> 18:44.867
This isn't a big deal,
I wear 2X.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.367
Daniel's got a huge
head like me.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.100
All the best people do.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.266
<i>So I'm going to give him</i>
<i>my mask</i>

18:50.266 --> 18:52.000
and we'll see
if he can get it together.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.900
[Andy speaking]

19:11.300 --> 19:12.867
How's it going?

19:13.800 --> 19:15.467
[Daniel speaking]

19:23.200 --> 19:24.900
[Andy] Yeah, because
you're at the end of the hose.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.800
Come closer in.

19:31.567 --> 19:33.300
[Daniel speaking]

19:33.367 --> 19:34.400
Keep going.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.567
I'm basically putting you
in front of the boat.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.467
That way you can
check over there for me.

19:38.467 --> 19:39.800
[Daniel] <i>Yes.</i>

25 minutes now.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.400
Doing really good.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.700
Found gold, I'm happy.

20:28.767 --> 20:31.700
Now we're just going
to dig down for another
two and a half hours,

20:31.767 --> 20:34.066
three hours,
and we're great.

[Kris] Well, we're not
technically dead,

The thing is,
there's nothing
mechanically wrong

21:06.867 --> 21:08.667
with that excavator at all.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.300
It should work.

21:10.300 --> 21:14.667
At least we're on the water
and we're working it out
rather than at the dock.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.100
We do have gold in the box,
but we just need a lot more.

21:18.166 --> 21:20.166
A lot more.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.567
Again, again,
with this damn excavator,

[man speaking]

21:39.100 --> 21:40.667

21:40.667 --> 21:43.467
Yeah, be like hey,

-[Kris speaking]

21:59.867 --> 22:01.200
Yeah, let's do that.

22:02.166 --> 22:04.400
So this is the deal.

22:04.467 --> 22:07.967
<i>We got to keep running</i>
<i>this piece of crap</i>
<i>excavator in limp mode.</i>

22:07.967 --> 22:09.300
What is limp mode?

22:09.300 --> 22:12.500
Limp mode means
it's working,
but just not at full power.

22:12.567 --> 22:14.967
<i>So everything will be</i>
<i>super slow,</i>

22:14.967 --> 22:17.700
<i>which honestly will be</i>
<i>pretty depressing to watch.</i>

22:17.767 --> 22:22.767
But this will be digging
and still getting gold
at a snail's pace.

22:22.767 --> 22:25.700
Make a little bit of gold,
but this is going to be
[bleep] slow.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.066
So late in the season.

22:29.066 --> 22:31.567
I just have to run
with what we got.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.467
So our machine right now
is in limp mode,

22:34.467 --> 22:38.767
which means that
it's not operating
at 100% speed one.

22:38.767 --> 22:42.367
Even though
the excavator should be
running faster,

22:42.367 --> 22:45.000
I'll take any gold
I can get right now.

22:45.967 --> 22:47.767
First bucket in a while.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.567
That's as fast as it'll move.

22:52.900 --> 22:56.467
So, we're getting gold,
it's just we're not
getting fast buckets.

22:58.467 --> 23:01.100
But thank God,
we're at least getting gold.

23:03.166 --> 23:07.367
Pretty pathetic,
but some money
is better than none.

23:09.467 --> 23:12.567
[Kris] Taking us twice
as long to do a scoop.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.867
So usually our cycle
time is 40 seconds.

23:15.867 --> 23:18.567
Right now,
it's a minute
and thirty seconds.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.367
Which is [bleep].

23:22.367 --> 23:26.367
I'm happy to see it
but I'm pissed
we're not running at 100%.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.367
That excavator's
pissing me off.

23:31.367 --> 23:33.400
Limp mode, how embarrassing.

23:33.467 --> 23:35.367
<i>Who wants to be in limp mode?</i>

23:35.367 --> 23:36.567
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

23:39.467 --> 23:42.467
Come on.
Andy moves faster than this.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.367
It's a piece of machinery.

23:44.367 --> 23:48.367
You know, it should fix,
and then it [bleep] works,

23:48.367 --> 23:51.800
and it's not [bleep]
working after you fix it.

23:51.867 --> 23:56.066
I poured money,
fixed so many damn things,

23:56.066 --> 23:59.467
I'm not a whining [bleep],
but this [bleep] not fair.

23:59.467 --> 24:02.100
I'm not going to call Kevin
and let him know the news.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.800
I'm just going to tell Kevin,
"Oh, things are going good"

24:04.867 --> 24:07.667
and then hopefully,
we can Band-Aid
everything up

24:07.667 --> 24:10.900
and still get 200
or 300 ounces this season,
that's what I'm hoping.

24:12.266 --> 24:13.567
[man speaking]

24:15.367 --> 24:17.266
Looks like we're just
going to stay on the boat

24:17.266 --> 24:19.867
and run it as long
as we possibly can.

24:19.867 --> 24:22.800
Like midnight
or two o'clock
in the morning.

24:22.867 --> 24:25.600
No point in telling anybody
the bad news until

24:25.667 --> 24:28.266
it's time to go home
and then I'll spring
it on them that,

24:28.266 --> 24:31.100
"Hey, we're staying around
another four or five hours."

24:31.166 --> 24:36.767
So, you know, like,
no point in taking away
people's momentum right now.

24:38.967 --> 24:40.567
At least, we're getting gold.

24:46.967 --> 24:49.266
[narrator] <i>As fierce</i>
<i>winds creep closer...</i>

24:52.900 --> 24:55.300
[man] <i>I test fired the pump</i>
<i>this morning,</i>
<i>it fired right up.</i>

24:55.367 --> 24:56.767
Sweet.
This is awesome.

24:56.767 --> 24:59.066
Dude, I'm stoked.
Let me go grab Shannon.

24:59.066 --> 25:01.367
[narrator] <i>Hopes</i>
<i>in the Tenhoff camp</i>
<i>are still high</i>

25:01.367 --> 25:05.367
<i>and the time has finally</i>
<i>come to launch</i>
<i>the mighty</i> Havilah.

25:08.467 --> 25:10.100
Yeah, buddy.

25:10.166 --> 25:13.066
[Zeke] <i>After weeks</i>
<i>and weeks of searching</i>
<i>around on Tomcod</i>

25:13.066 --> 25:16.367
for hotspots,
I'm really ready
to unleash the <i>Havilah</i> on it

25:16.367 --> 25:19.100
and see what kind of damage
we can do
with a 10-inch dredge.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.867
Off we go.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.400
<i>It'll be super sweet</i>
<i>to step up our game</i>
<i>this summer</i>

25:23.467 --> 25:26.100
<i>on a great dredge</i>
<i>and on a great claim.</i>

25:26.100 --> 25:28.700
Honestly, the only thing
that would make it better
this season

25:28.767 --> 25:30.033
is if we have more time.

25:30.066 --> 25:33.467
But we'll crush it
with the amount of time
we have left.

25:33.467 --> 25:37.266
<i>They've like really gotten</i>
<i>a good handle on running</i>
<i>all the systems</i>

25:37.266 --> 25:41.266
<i>on this big boat</i>
<i>and figuring it out</i>
<i>and making it work well.</i>

25:41.266 --> 25:43.800
Big, powerful diesel pump.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.367
Big, a 10-inch hose,
four dudes,

25:48.367 --> 25:50.100
I want to see
what that can do.

26:10.467 --> 26:13.367
[Gabe] So looks like
we're sending Zeke down first.

26:13.367 --> 26:14.567
He's got the spot.

26:14.567 --> 26:17.166
He's going to make sure
we get right on it.

26:17.166 --> 26:20.066
[Zeke] <i>We're going</i>
<i>to start off with a little</i>
<i>patch that I found</i>

26:20.066 --> 26:22.200
is difficult
to get through with
the 6-inch dredge.

26:22.266 --> 26:24.000
But I think
with a 10-inch dredge,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.767
there's just more volume,
and we'll be able to move
through it real easily.

26:26.767 --> 26:28.467
[Zeke speaking]

26:34.867 --> 26:38.767
[Zeke] We'll need to anchor the
Havilah exactly over the
spot that
I found.

26:38.767 --> 26:41.400
It was a little bit easier
with the six-inch dredge

26:41.467 --> 26:43.200
because you could be
off a little bit

26:43.266 --> 26:46.900
and that you could more
easily move it around
from the bottom.

26:46.967 --> 26:50.700
<i>The</i> Havilah <i>is a massive boat</i>
<i>and we have to be</i>
<i>a lot more accurate.</i>

26:50.767 --> 26:53.767
I'm pulling us over that way.

26:53.767 --> 26:56.467
If you don't get it right,
then you're not going
to get gold

26:56.467 --> 26:58.767
because you need to have
it in the exact right spot

26:58.767 --> 27:00.567
and it looks like it takes
a lot of...

27:00.567 --> 27:03.767
it's like difficult and takes
a lot of finesse to do.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.567
Pull over
a little bit towards the port.

27:10.767 --> 27:14.100
Okay, so the thing's line

27:14.100 --> 27:17.467
should be between 25-30 feet
right off the [bleep] bow.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.900
[Zeke speaking]

27:30.667 --> 27:32.000
[Gabe speaking]

27:34.166 --> 27:35.567
[Zeke speaking]

27:35.567 --> 27:36.900
[Gabe speaking]

27:57.700 --> 27:59.900
[Zeke] <i>I think</i>
<i>I recognize where I am,</i>

27:59.967 --> 28:03.000
<i>and I think</i>
<i>it's in both directions,</i>
<i>that's really good.</i>

28:04.066 --> 28:05.767
Yeah.
You seeing well?

28:05.767 --> 28:07.300
[Zeke speaking]

28:14.166 --> 28:15.600
All right.

28:16.767 --> 28:18.266
[Zeke] <i>Where,</i>
<i>where am I right now?</i>

28:18.266 --> 28:20.800
<i>Am I on the starboard</i>
<i>side of the boat?</i>

28:20.867 --> 28:23.667
Yeah. You're like,
10 feet off the dive ladder.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.100
Hey, man, how's that
10-inch compared to the six?

28:36.100 --> 28:38.166
I know you've been
working that 6 all season.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.500
How is it?
How does it feel?

28:39.567 --> 28:40.800
Are you comfortable?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.000
[Zeke speaking]

28:44.800 --> 28:46.066
[laughter]

28:46.066 --> 28:47.500
[Zeke speaking]

28:55.000 --> 28:58.667
[Gabe] Are you getting
on any hard pan
or is it all pea gravel?

28:58.667 --> 29:00.066
[Zeke speaking]

29:07.467 --> 29:10.667
How... I mean,
if you're in it right now,
open that thing up.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.467
Start, start that
big old cut.

29:12.467 --> 29:15.266
Just work it back and forth
as wide as you can.

29:19.166 --> 29:20.600
[Zeke speaking]

29:28.300 --> 29:32.066
Well, we're going to hog
all the material,
the cobble and the sand,

29:32.066 --> 29:34.600
everything. It's going to be
a barren [bleep] wasteland,

29:34.667 --> 29:36.367
FernGully [bleep]
down there.

29:36.367 --> 29:37.467
Okay?

29:38.266 --> 29:39.567
We're on the money now!

29:39.567 --> 29:41.100

[narrator] <i>Nine miles east...</i>

30:08.867 --> 30:10.166
You got down.
You went right for it.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.467
Good job, bro.

30:11.467 --> 30:12.567
[Daniel speaking]

30:12.567 --> 30:14.000
All right, come back up.

30:15.467 --> 30:16.567
[Daniel speaking]

30:17.967 --> 30:19.166
Daniel surprised me.

30:19.166 --> 30:22.467
He got down there,
got the gold,
and didn't complain.

30:22.467 --> 30:23.567
[Daniel speaking]

30:26.767 --> 30:27.900
Now, it's Anthony's turn.

30:27.967 --> 30:29.767
Last time, he dove,
he [bleep] the bed.

30:29.767 --> 30:31.667
<i>He got a day ending rock jam.</i>

30:34.867 --> 30:36.667

30:37.867 --> 30:40.800
It couldn't have gone
any worse with Anthony.

30:40.867 --> 30:43.266
<i>He's going to have</i>
<i>to show me something</i>
<i>real different</i>

30:43.266 --> 30:44.967

kicking rocks.

30:45.567 --> 30:46.967
[Andy speaking]

30:51.000 --> 30:52.100
All set?

[Andy speaking]

31:08.166 --> 31:09.567
[Anthony speaking]

31:10.367 --> 31:12.867
Looks like
he's sucking material

31:12.867 --> 31:15.367
and I'm looking at rocks
going through the box.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.567
[Andy speaking]

31:19.166 --> 31:20.767
[Anthony speaking]

31:22.200 --> 31:23.467
What?

31:26.667 --> 31:29.000
Did he just say
he can't hear anything?

31:33.166 --> 31:34.567
Anthony?

31:37.367 --> 31:38.800
Hey, [bleep].

31:43.867 --> 31:45.900
So far, I'm not optimistic.

31:45.967 --> 31:47.867

No.

32:30.066 --> 32:31.367
[Anthony speaking]

32:34.667 --> 32:36.266
This guy's been down
10 minutes,

32:36.266 --> 32:37.934
he already wants a break.

32:37.934 --> 32:40.567
<i>Hell, I've been down</i>
<i>for three hours at a time</i>
<i>before I need a break.</i>

32:40.567 --> 32:42.967
I can already smell
how this one's going.

32:42.967 --> 32:44.166
He's coming up for a break.

32:44.166 --> 32:45.767
I had to pull him
for the break.

32:45.767 --> 32:47.800
What the [bleep], dude!

32:48.700 --> 32:50.500
I've seen some [bleep]
in my life, dude,

32:50.567 --> 32:54.367
but I've never had to drag
somebody in the boat
for a cigarette.

32:54.367 --> 32:56.367
I don't know
where my brother found
this dude at, man.

32:56.367 --> 32:57.800
This dude's from Alabama.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.100
He should have
stayed in Alabama.

33:01.166 --> 33:04.100
When you hear amateur hour,
this is it right here.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.667
[Anthony speaking]

33:06.667 --> 33:07.767
[Daniel] You good?

33:07.767 --> 33:08.967
[Anthony] Yeah.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.767

33:13.767 --> 33:15.100
[Anthony] Uh, a little.

33:16.266 --> 33:18.266
[Andy speaking]

33:19.100 --> 33:20.567
I thought
this was amateur hour,

33:20.567 --> 33:23.100
but no,
it's amateur 10 minutes.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.667
<i>I think I've seen</i>
<i>all I need to see</i>
<i>from Anthony,</i>

33:25.667 --> 33:27.967
not that he has anything
else to show.

33:28.367 --> 33:29.667
No gold.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.500
Waste of gas.

33:31.567 --> 33:33.100
Waste of my time.

33:33.100 --> 33:34.867
This guy is my night crew.

33:34.867 --> 33:37.467
So why would
I want somebody like
that on my night crew?

33:37.467 --> 33:40.266
I dive and get gold
and he takes a percentage?

33:40.266 --> 33:42.000
I already got one
[bleep] like that.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.600
I got my dad.

33:43.667 --> 33:45.100
I don't need another one.

33:48.266 --> 33:50.500
All right,
today was a decent day.

33:50.567 --> 33:52.367
I got to see
what everybody can do,

33:52.367 --> 33:55.166
and I figured out
what I needed to know.

33:56.467 --> 33:58.100
Now it's time to
eliminate people.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.000

come in, like,
we've got to get out of here.

that enjoyable.

we will get some
decent days out, you know,

-Yeah.

Let's Rocktober.

36:55.467 --> 36:57.266
-Just don't hit the rocks.
-What?

36:57.266 --> 36:59.200

It's October.

37:19.767 --> 37:22.300

37:41.867 --> 37:45.900
[Shawn] I have to admit,
I had a point with all
the breakdowns and everything.

37:45.967 --> 37:48.467
I was getting
a little frustrated.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.967
I've been working, working,
working on the <i>Myrtle.</i>

37:50.967 --> 37:53.667

trying different things

kind of coming together
right now.

38:01.266 --> 38:02.700

38:07.300 --> 38:09.767
[chuckles] Yeah.

38:12.467 --> 38:15.400
I don't know
how much more time we got.

38:15.467 --> 38:18.000
We're going to check the box,
see how we're doing.

38:20.700 --> 38:25.266
Real hard to say,
but I mean,

38:25.266 --> 38:29.767
there's definitely some
fresh gold in that
open top there.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.100
Nice and soft.

Hey, you all,

Yeah, he was pulling
the kink over to the side

Yeah. We must have,

from the [bleep] <i>south.</i>

it just maybe that,

on something that
it wanted to be on.

49:29.166 --> 49:30.266
All right.

49:30.266 --> 49:32.567
Get this jarred up
and get the hell out of here.

49:33.367 --> 49:34.767
That's a wrap.

49:53.767 --> 49:55.700
[narrator] <i>As the storm</i>
<i>begins to land,</i>

49:55.767 --> 49:59.066
<i>the rising waves have</i>
<i>forced the miners</i>
<i>off the water.</i>

49:59.800 --> 50:01.266
<i>All except for one.</i>

50:02.266 --> 50:06.166
I got a call bright
and early this morning.

50:06.166 --> 50:10.567
There's a dredge
in distress about 17 miles
to the east of town

50:10.567 --> 50:13.066
and three miles to the south.

50:13.066 --> 50:14.400
They're dead in the water.

50:14.467 --> 50:15.800
No power.

50:15.867 --> 50:17.367
Wind's picking up.

50:17.367 --> 50:19.900
They're calling
for 28-knot winds.

50:19.967 --> 50:22.200
I'm seeing the waves
starting to pick up already.

50:22.266 --> 50:23.867
That's a lot for this boat.

50:23.867 --> 50:28.367
But there's nobody else
jumping up
and getting underway,

50:28.367 --> 50:30.100
so we'll go out
and give them a hand.

50:30.100 --> 50:32.100
This is a friend of mine,
Yukon John.

50:32.100 --> 50:33.567
That's what we do
around here.

50:33.567 --> 50:34.667
We help each other out.

50:34.667 --> 50:36.467
The Coast Guard
is nowhere around.

50:36.467 --> 50:40.600
It would take them
a long time to get
any type of equipment

50:40.667 --> 50:42.100
up here to do a rescue.

50:42.100 --> 50:46.000
He's fortunate that
he was able to relay
his position

50:46.000 --> 50:47.200
so we can go get him.

50:47.266 --> 50:49.367
Otherwise,
he would end up
over in Siberia here

50:49.367 --> 50:51.066
in about two weeks.

50:51.066 --> 50:52.400
The weather's getting
much worse

50:52.467 --> 50:55.100
and now I'm heading out
into the thick of it

50:55.100 --> 50:56.900
and that's because
I got a call.

50:56.967 --> 51:00.200
<i>My man, Yukon John</i>
<i>got his engine swamped,</i>

51:00.266 --> 51:03.767
<i>and now he's stuck</i>
<i>and it looks like</i>
<i>his boat is going down.</i>

51:03.767 --> 51:05.567
<i>Not going to lie.</i>

51:05.567 --> 51:09.900
<i>It's a big risk going out</i>
<i>in these conditions,</i>
<i>especially for the gold ship.</i>

51:09.967 --> 51:13.467
She ain't no rescue vessel,
but if there's a miner
in need,

51:13.467 --> 51:14.867
you got to help.

51:15.667 --> 51:16.767
Well, we got a call.

51:16.767 --> 51:19.367
Yukon John's out there
dead in the water,

51:19.367 --> 51:21.867
17 miles
out of town to the east,

51:21.867 --> 51:24.800
straight up from Cape Nome,
about three miles out
from the beach.

51:24.867 --> 51:26.166
We'll go down to the Cape.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.900
We'll take a real good
look at it.

51:27.967 --> 51:30.266
If it looks like
it ain't gonna sink us,

51:30.266 --> 51:34.000
we'll go on out,
pass him a line,
get him back in close to shore

51:34.000 --> 51:35.467
and bring him to town.

51:44.066 --> 51:45.700
[man speaking]

51:50.700 --> 51:51.800
[Vernon] Oh, okay.

51:51.867 --> 51:53.400
[man speaking]

51:57.800 --> 52:01.066
I'm pretty sure
we'll be able to spot him
when we get down there.

52:01.066 --> 52:03.967
As long as he's still above
the waves, we'll spot him.

52:03.967 --> 52:07.900
We still got to lasso
his ass and then
tow him back to town.

52:07.967 --> 52:12.867
Hopefully, everything
will go smoothly,
but most likely it won't.

52:20.667 --> 52:22.066
Hold on.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.266
Check the box.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.200

[Vernon] <i>Finding that boat</i>
<i>in this kind of weather</i>

53:18.767 --> 53:21.367
<i>is like finding a needle</i>

53:21.367 --> 53:24.467
Flares burn bright,
but we're not seeing
any sign of him.

53:27.367 --> 53:28.867
It's time to go to plan B.

54:14.767 --> 54:16.367
[Vernon speaking]

54:17.367 --> 54:19.066
All right, we got
the coordinates punched in.

54:19.066 --> 54:20.467
We're looking it up now.

54:20.467 --> 54:22.100

[Vernon] <i>Things</i>

54:43.667 --> 54:45.900
<i>The sluice box</i>

54:45.967 --> 54:49.000
<i>It could come off</i>
<i>and smash the side</i>

54:49.066 --> 54:52.867
More importantly,
we're nowhere near Yukon John.

54:52.867 --> 54:54.166
<i>He's seven miles away.</i>

54:54.166 --> 54:56.667
<i>Almost 10 miles off shore.</i>

54:56.667 --> 54:58.867
<i>That far from land</i>
<i>in weather like this,</i>

54:58.867 --> 55:02.000
is about as precarious
as it gets for miners.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
So we've got to cut
south now and see

55:05.066 --> 55:07.867
if we can rendezvous
with them out there,

55:09.100 --> 55:11.767
which is not
where I want to go.

55:21.467 --> 55:22.867
[narrator]
<i>Back on the water...</i>

55:25.200 --> 55:27.000
[Vernon] The further
offshore we go,

55:27.066 --> 55:29.266
the bigger the seas

But right now,
we're the only hope he's got.

55:42.367 --> 55:44.667
We got the new coordinates
from Yukon John.

55:44.667 --> 55:47.567
He's been blown way
the hell offshore.

55:58.667 --> 56:00.467

In these seas anything that
can come undone
will come undone.

56:10.400 --> 56:14.000
[Thomas] Man, swells
are getting pretty big
out here.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.367
I can only imagine
what's going through
their head

56:16.367 --> 56:18.567
at the moment having no...

56:18.567 --> 56:21.900
motor. This is pretty crazy
having motors.

56:23.066 --> 56:27.266
I'm surprised to still get
cell phone reception.

56:27.266 --> 56:30.500
Give us an update
on the GPS coordinates.

56:30.567 --> 56:32.066

get swamped,

57:11.567 --> 57:12.967
That's what happens.

57:15.467 --> 57:18.300

we don't have the right
coordinates.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.900

Let me get you to the GPS guy.

58:39.100 --> 58:40.767

58:42.700 --> 58:44.266
But we finally
tracked him down.

58:44.266 --> 58:46.367
He's way to hell offshore.

58:46.367 --> 58:50.967
And he's been,
being pounded by these waves

59:10.166 --> 59:11.767

59:18.266 --> 59:22.367
[Vernon] Okay. So the thing
that we gotta do is make sure

59:22.367 --> 59:27.667
that we do not get that line
caught around our propeller.

59:27.667 --> 59:29.967
Guys, if you do it,
you're going to...

59:29.967 --> 59:34.066

1:18:18.266 --> 1:18:20.667
it's not safe.
It's not good.

1:18:20.734 --> 1:18:24.867
<i>It's easy for boats</i>
<i>to slam into each other</i>
<i>and lines to get tangled.</i>

1:18:24.867 --> 1:18:28.667
You don't want anything
to go wrong with these
kind of waves all around you.

1:18:32.166 --> 1:18:34.600
[Chris] We're gonna throw
the dinghy in the water.

1:18:34.667 --> 1:18:38.200
Can you jump on the dinghy?
And let it go fast.

1:18:38.266 --> 1:18:40.867
[Yukon speaking]

1:18:40.867 --> 1:18:44.834
[Chris speaking]

1:18:44.834 --> 1:18:47.000
[Yukon speaking]

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:48.867
-[Joe] Okay.
-[Yukon speaking]

1:18:48.867 --> 1:18:50.834
-[Chris speaking]
-[Shawn] All right.

1:18:52.300 --> 1:18:54.834
[Joe speaking]

1:18:57.166 --> 1:18:58.734
[Yukon speaking]

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:01.867
[Joe speaking]

1:19:01.934 --> 1:19:04.400
[Yukon speaking]

1:19:04.467 --> 1:19:06.166
[Chris] Let's wait till
they're ready, huh?

1:19:06.166 --> 1:19:07.667
-[Shawn] Yeah.
-[Joe] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:19:07.734 --> 1:19:09.667
[waves splashing]

1:19:09.734 --> 1:19:12.500
The plan is we're gonna
deploy this dinghy,

1:19:12.567 --> 1:19:15.033
so that we don't have to
come close to their vessel

1:19:15.033 --> 1:19:16.667
because that could get
really dangerous.

1:19:16.734 --> 1:19:19.400
So the smartest way to do
is throw this out in the ocean

1:19:19.467 --> 1:19:21.133
and hopefully
they can get on it

1:19:21.133 --> 1:19:25.266
and we can really back reel,
reel them back into the boat.

1:19:32.734 --> 1:19:35.166
[Chris] All right, guys...
We're gonna throw you this.

1:19:35.667 --> 1:19:37.300
One, two.

1:19:40.066 --> 1:19:41.567
[Chris] Okay.
Go grab it.

1:19:42.734 --> 1:19:43.767
Just jump in it?

1:19:43.834 --> 1:19:46.033
[Joe] Yeah, jump on it.
Hurry up.

1:19:46.033 --> 1:19:47.400
Hey.

1:19:50.867 --> 1:19:52.166
We got 'em.
We got 'em.

1:19:52.166 --> 1:19:53.500
[Shawn] Okay.

1:20:03.100 --> 1:20:04.400
All right. Grab the dinghy.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:09.266
[Shawn] Nice job, boys.

1:20:09.266 --> 1:20:10.467
-Good stuff.
-Yeah.

1:20:10.467 --> 1:20:12.567
[Yukon] Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1:20:12.567 --> 1:20:14.734
-Mission complete.
-I owe you one.

1:20:14.734 --> 1:20:16.100
I owe you one.

1:20:16.100 --> 1:20:17.867

1:20:19.567 --> 1:20:22.066
<i>We don't want to admit</i>
<i>when we pushed it too far,</i>

1:20:22.066 --> 1:20:25.066
and the last thing
we want to do is abandon
our dredge

1:20:25.066 --> 1:20:26.467
ten miles offshore.

1:20:26.467 --> 1:20:28.934
<i>These dredges cost</i>
<i>a lot of money,</i>

1:20:28.934 --> 1:20:31.400
<i>and some guys put everything</i>
<i>they have into them.</i>

1:20:31.467 --> 1:20:36.500
But it's hard to admit
when Mother Nature beats you
and it's time to give it up.
