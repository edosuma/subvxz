WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.982
I'm at the motel. It's your dad.

00:03.031 --> 00:05.412
They found him in his room.

00:05.461 --> 00:07.563
We think that they're going
to charge you with manslaughter.

00:07.612 --> 00:09.461
When you have the right person,

00:09.510 --> 00:12.016
when the evidence leads
to a suspect so obvious.

00:12.065 --> 00:13.325
I am talking to you

00:13.374 --> 00:15.476
and I decide when I go, Dad.

00:15.525 --> 00:17.882
- Let go of me!
- Who hated him, who was in his room,

00:17.931 --> 00:19.997
her DNA under his fingernails?

00:20.046 --> 00:22.162
You snuck into his room after he left,

00:22.211 --> 00:23.453
and he caught you.

00:23.502 --> 00:24.741
And you killed him.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.091
It was an accident.

00:27.179 --> 00:29.117
What are they gonna do to me?

00:29.166 --> 00:31.156
Shane, I'm sorry about
how I got you in here.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.183
Promise me you'll take the meds.

00:33.295 --> 00:36.394
What about Neil Bellegarde,
dumped on the edge of town?

00:36.443 --> 00:39.522
I refuse to answer your question
until I consult with counsel.

00:39.571 --> 00:41.342
What happens to Sam Mercer?

00:41.436 --> 00:43.369
It's up to the new chief to decide.

00:43.471 --> 00:45.834
A group of Winnipeggers
started Bear Clan Patrol.

00:45.883 --> 00:48.693
We stop fights,
keep an eye on sex workers.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.982
I can't compete with Singapore.

00:51.159 --> 00:54.544
Did you think about asking me...
to stay with you?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.259 --> 01:06.665
We're not changing strategy.

01:06.714 --> 01:09.308
He posted it,
we should use it. We're late.

01:09.357 --> 01:11.391
We already decided and we're on time.

01:11.561 --> 01:13.242
On time isn't late.

01:13.428 --> 01:15.741
- You forgot your coffee.
- No, I drank it already.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.362
I'm not saying we should lead with it,

01:17.411 --> 01:18.893
but if it happens to slip out.

01:18.942 --> 01:21.540
- It's not relevant evidence.
- Relevance is relative.

01:21.541 --> 01:23.947
That's cute, but we're not doing it.

01:24.081 --> 01:26.445
William Crawford, Joanna Chang.
Crawford Chang.

01:26.494 --> 01:27.670
We have to do everything we can,

01:27.719 --> 01:29.137
- to pull out a win.
- We won't need it.

01:29.186 --> 01:31.650
- We have something.
- It's not something.

01:31.688 --> 01:33.497
We can make it something.
That's lawyering.

01:33.546 --> 01:34.866
Staying on the ethical
side of the line,

01:34.914 --> 01:36.147
doesn't make you a bad lawyer.

01:36.196 --> 01:39.048
We start with that, then we're
no different from your old firm.

01:39.328 --> 01:42.173
We're trying to win a case but
we're also trying to build a firm.

01:42.222 --> 01:44.290
Crawford Chang has to stand
for something.

01:44.339 --> 01:45.714
I think I left the iron on.

01:45.763 --> 01:47.696
Crawford Chang will stand
for winning cases,

01:47.771 --> 01:50.805
and it turns off
automatically, the iron.

01:51.104 --> 01:53.289
We want the jury to think
that this could happen to them.

01:53.338 --> 01:55.152
- Play on their fear.
- But not too hard

01:55.230 --> 01:56.823
or we'll lose them. Stay likeable.

01:56.872 --> 01:59.514
- I am likeable.
- Jury's still out, Crawford.

01:59.697 --> 02:01.198
I'm more likeable than you.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.205
Well, that is a very low bar.

02:04.035 --> 02:06.768
- Cat, sorry we're late.
- On time isn't late.

02:06.817 --> 02:07.976
I got here early.

02:08.025 --> 02:10.625
I made copies of all the files,
there's water in there if you need it

02:10.716 --> 02:12.689
and I had some thoughts
about the summation.

02:12.738 --> 02:13.713
We'll deal with that later.

02:13.762 --> 02:15.822
First, we'll question the plant
manager, make him squirm.

02:15.871 --> 02:17.499
OK.

02:17.766 --> 02:19.095
But thank you.

02:19.144 --> 02:21.507
Oh, no need to thank me. It's my job.

02:22.139 --> 02:24.639
I know, just working on my likeability.

02:25.611 --> 02:27.580
Today could be a very hard day.

02:27.629 --> 02:30.025
We're almost at the end,
so stay strong.

02:30.074 --> 02:31.182
Thank you,

02:31.231 --> 02:33.174
- for what you've done for Kadra.
- Yes, thank you.

02:33.223 --> 02:34.516
We'll get her justice.

02:34.595 --> 02:36.286
- OK.
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.126 --> 02:39.070
Cat'll take you in.

02:43.466 --> 02:45.023
We should've taken the settlement.

02:45.095 --> 02:47.495
- The family turned it down.
- We persuaded them.

02:47.678 --> 02:49.217
I persuaded them.

02:49.266 --> 02:50.867
It was insulting.

02:51.335 --> 02:53.158
I know we have to win.

02:54.696 --> 02:59.126
Juries like blue, brings out your eyes.

03:01.698 --> 03:03.050
Ready?

03:25.411 --> 03:28.302
As the factory manager,
wouldn't it be your responsibility,

03:28.351 --> 03:29.857
to ensure that the deceased,

03:29.906 --> 03:32.393
Kadra Tabar,
had the appropriate training

03:32.442 --> 03:33.584
before starting work?

03:33.646 --> 03:35.107
Kadra was a temp.

03:35.156 --> 03:37.794
We're not obligated
to train temporary workers.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.675
So she was working near machinery,

03:40.724 --> 03:41.948
including the threader machine

03:41.997 --> 03:44.011
which ultimately, took her life,

03:44.060 --> 03:46.742
with... no training at all?

03:46.823 --> 03:48.656
She was a temporary worker.

03:49.425 --> 03:51.044
We can't afford to train them.

03:51.093 --> 03:53.521
If we had to pay to train Kadra,

03:53.570 --> 03:55.374
we couldn't have hired her.

03:56.262 --> 04:00.268
Not even a five minute safety talk.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.231
She was going to college at night.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.425
She was smart. She could've done
at lot with a little.

04:04.474 --> 04:06.927
We expect some common sense.

04:06.976 --> 04:09.505
I told Kadra not to wear the scarf.

04:09.554 --> 04:10.812
Uh, the hijab?

04:10.861 --> 04:13.487
Flowing clothes on the factory floor...

04:13.669 --> 04:15.138
do not mix.

04:15.809 --> 04:17.168
Lots of them wear it.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.368
- Them.
- Our workers.

04:20.958 --> 04:23.858
There was the option
to upgrade the machinery,

04:24.046 --> 04:25.958
to protect loose clothing.

04:26.007 --> 04:27.153
The owner said no.

04:27.202 --> 04:29.669
It was expensive
and it slowed work down.

04:30.747 --> 04:32.057
I'm sorry.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.372
Excuse me, Your Honour, one second.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.461
Make it quick, Mr. Crawford.

04:38.751 --> 04:40.639
- Jury believes him.
- Don't do it.

04:40.688 --> 04:42.971
He made a racist joke about Muslims.

04:43.020 --> 04:44.512
She didn't die because he's a racist;

04:44.561 --> 04:46.407
she died because
the owner was negligent.

04:46.456 --> 04:48.762
And also, questions may
be raised about how we uncovered

04:48.811 --> 04:50.333
a post that was already deleted.

04:50.545 --> 04:52.098
We could be disciplined.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.620
- We need a move.
- Ms. Chang,

04:54.669 --> 04:56.403
we hate to disturb you.

04:56.452 --> 04:58.289
I'm sorry, Your Honour.

04:58.645 --> 05:01.236
He's trying to show
that he was on her side.

05:06.856 --> 05:08.512
On that night,

05:08.561 --> 05:10.981
the deceased was working
near the conveyor belt?

05:11.030 --> 05:13.496
Yes. Kadra was delivering materials.

05:13.545 --> 05:15.497
And you were there, on the floor,

05:15.546 --> 05:18.380
- when her hijab got tangled.
- Yes.

05:18.494 --> 05:21.194
Kadra's hijab got caught
in the J-Clamp.

05:21.337 --> 05:25.028
You've said her name...
five or six times now,

05:25.077 --> 05:26.980
did your lawyer
instruct you to do that?

05:27.184 --> 05:31.169
to... make it seem like
you saw her as a human being?

05:33.465 --> 05:36.712
At the moment of this
young person's tragic death,

05:36.761 --> 05:39.575
on your watch, with no training...

05:40.567 --> 05:43.096
... did you know her name then?

05:47.571 --> 05:50.552
You have to answer the question.

05:52.202 --> 05:53.712
No.

05:56.887 --> 05:58.356
No.

05:59.612 --> 06:02.146
No further questions, Your Honour.

06:28.717 --> 06:30.170
Hey, Bear Clan Patrol.

06:30.219 --> 06:31.717
Let's all head towards the park,

06:31.772 --> 06:33.850
I'll grab the supply van
and meet you there.

06:33.899 --> 06:35.904
Keep your eyes open for sharks.

06:39.645 --> 06:40.951
Luna.

06:41.076 --> 06:42.178
Lilly got in a blue truck,

06:42.235 --> 06:44.051
at Robinson and Fuller
a few minutes ago.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.367
- Did you get the plate?
- Yeah, I put it in the log.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.235
I think we saw a blue truck last week.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.104
What is with these guys?
I don't get it,

06:50.153 --> 06:52.587
who's looking for it
this early in the morning?

06:55.793 --> 06:59.091
We saw a blue truck
last Friday by the park.

06:59.518 --> 07:01.541
- Your memory is coming back.
- Mm-hm,

07:01.590 --> 07:02.870
be careful. I might start remembering

07:02.918 --> 07:04.893
when it's your turn
to take out the garbage.

07:04.942 --> 07:07.128
Oh no, you're going to realize
I'm a terrible roommate.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.799
Oh no, I already realized that one.

07:08.848 --> 07:10.144
Hey!

07:12.651 --> 07:14.047
It's Mr. Red Car, Luna.

07:14.096 --> 07:15.934
Taylor, there are lots of red cars.

07:15.983 --> 07:17.621
No, that looks like his car.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.729
It's him.

07:18.778 --> 07:20.839
Looks like he has someone, too.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.274
You know what? I'm just gonna...

07:22.323 --> 07:24.433
cut across Sutherland,
he might be taking her there.

07:24.482 --> 07:26.067
Taylor, we don't confront the johns.

07:26.116 --> 07:28.700
I'm just gonna check it out,
OK? Back me up.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.125
- I found him.
- You see the plate?

07:48.195 --> 07:51.180
- It's him, Lu'.
- You need to call out the plate.

07:51.229 --> 07:52.429
It's protocol.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.312
Stop it, stop it!

08:04.361 --> 08:06.312
I only had a twenty!

08:06.580 --> 08:09.010
V-R-O-2-2-9.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.907
OK. Pull back.

08:18.630 --> 08:19.877
Come here!

08:19.926 --> 08:22.675
Come here! Get up!

08:22.724 --> 08:23.965
Get your hands off me!

08:25.491 --> 08:27.676
Taylor.

08:41.385 --> 08:44.220
Hey, are you OK?

09:09.518 --> 09:14.028
Owen. I'm just here helping the pastor.

09:15.557 --> 09:18.075
Lawnmower there. Probably should
have got a new one.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.324
When a man takes another
man's life, that's murder.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.104
That's how I understand the law.

09:23.518 --> 09:26.607
25 to life,
not two years and out in six months.

09:27.072 --> 09:28.455
I... I pled guilty.

09:28.504 --> 09:30.815
After your lawyer cut a deal.

09:31.143 --> 09:33.435
I took full responsibility
for my actions.

09:35.138 --> 09:37.238
That old me is, uh...

09:38.315 --> 09:39.393
gone.

09:39.442 --> 09:42.476
You took Neil Bellegarde's life,

09:43.557 --> 09:45.024
and as of yet,

09:45.128 --> 09:47.107
that debt is not paid.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.755
You're on parole.

09:49.804 --> 09:51.969
One slip and I'll see you pay

09:52.508 --> 09:54.164
and I'll be watching you.

09:55.241 --> 09:56.841
You do that, Owen.

09:57.109 --> 09:59.543
Please watch me and I'll prove to you

09:59.709 --> 10:01.276
that I'm a different man.

10:02.270 --> 10:04.617
I've come back to my church
and my family.

10:06.468 --> 10:08.125
People can change.

10:08.621 --> 10:11.032
Stay away from me and my family.

10:24.818 --> 10:26.026
How'd it go?

10:26.075 --> 10:27.685
- Jury's out.
- We just have to wait.

10:27.734 --> 10:30.134
- Any calls?
- Yeah, calls and mail.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.407
I filed the papers into
the research you asked for.

10:33.456 --> 10:35.423
- It's on your desk.
- Thank you. Good job.

10:36.748 --> 10:39.881
Hey, here is the memo
on product liability.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.315
Thanks, Rylan.

10:42.556 --> 10:44.204
If you hate it, I can rewrite it.

10:44.253 --> 10:48.950
No, I don't hate it.
I haven't even read it yet.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.630
But I can try again. I'll stay late.

10:50.679 --> 10:53.017
No, no. This is fine. Thank you.

10:56.132 --> 10:57.372
Lakeview called about your brother,

10:57.421 --> 10:58.442
they need you to send a cheque.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.541
OK.

11:02.237 --> 11:05.466
You know, giving them a "good job"
from time to time wouldn't hurt.

11:05.526 --> 11:08.268
- No one ever said "good job" to me.
- Oh, come on.

11:08.317 --> 11:10.123
"Good job" doesn't mean anything,

11:10.172 --> 11:11.732
and it makes them think
they're actually doing

11:11.780 --> 11:13.222
a good job when they aren't.

11:13.404 --> 11:15.381
- We can't coddle them.
- I don't think you have to worry

11:15.430 --> 11:17.404
about being too coddle-y, boss.

11:17.453 --> 11:19.386
I don't expect perfection,

11:19.435 --> 11:21.221
but that should be the goal.

11:23.546 --> 11:25.880
Stop thinking about the jury, just...

11:25.958 --> 11:27.982
Try to put it out of your mind.

11:28.599 --> 11:30.747
Our employees like you more.
You're fun, Billy.

11:30.796 --> 11:32.623
Well, they're scared of you.

11:32.672 --> 11:35.271
- You could be nicer.
- Well, you could be meaner.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.677
When I was an associate,

11:36.726 --> 11:38.825
I didn't leave before a partner
at the end of the night.

11:38.874 --> 11:41.408
I didn't book a lunchtime yoga class.

11:41.457 --> 11:43.724
It's a different time,
they're a different generation.

11:44.256 --> 11:46.223
Just make an effort with them.

11:48.550 --> 11:50.618
Is that you putting it
out of your mind?

11:51.052 --> 11:53.787
- We need a win.
- We have other work.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.575
Some.

11:56.811 --> 11:58.042
You OK?

11:58.091 --> 12:00.771
You can't keep asking me that.
I am wonderful.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.007
- There's an edge.
- I'm fine, Billy.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.162
It's just another day.

12:04.211 --> 12:05.631
Look, we've lived together for a year.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.967
I can read you like a book.

12:07.086 --> 12:09.003
Couldn't be better.

12:09.383 --> 12:12.424
OK.

12:13.022 --> 12:14.677
Oh.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.012
Except tomorrow is the anniversary

12:18.061 --> 12:19.860
of my father's murder, so.

12:20.896 --> 12:22.283
Hi, Diane.

12:22.376 --> 12:24.238
Sorry I haven't been
returning your calls.

12:24.475 --> 12:26.463
Please tell me you're coming
to the centennial.

12:26.512 --> 12:27.837
No, Billy's going for us.

12:27.886 --> 12:29.499
He loves high school reunions.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.776
But I want you to come.

12:30.873 --> 12:33.116
I went to Millwood
High for nine months,

12:33.165 --> 12:34.393
like, a million years ago.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.709
This is my first event as principal.

12:36.758 --> 12:38.100
I would love some of the students

12:38.149 --> 12:39.782
to meet accomplished alumni.

12:40.139 --> 12:42.236
I am immune to ass kissing.

12:42.951 --> 12:44.305
I miss your face.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.363
I'm swamped at work. I'll try.

12:47.412 --> 12:49.977
Not good enough!
"Try" means you're not coming.

12:50.026 --> 12:51.326
Besides,

12:51.381 --> 12:54.686
I have a surprise for you.

12:59.795 --> 13:02.323
- Diane?
- Uh...

13:03.607 --> 13:04.701
still here.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.889
Um...

13:07.162 --> 13:09.826
Come, please.
I promise you won't regret it.

13:09.951 --> 13:11.867
OK, I'll really try.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.040
So, do you have plans this weekend?

13:29.232 --> 13:30.999
I have plans, but I could work.

13:31.048 --> 13:32.686
Yeah, I can come in too, it's fine.

13:32.735 --> 13:34.038
No, no, I'm not asking you to work;

13:34.087 --> 13:36.113
I'm just asking if you have plans.

13:37.805 --> 13:41.261
- What are you doing on the weekend?
- I... I don't get it.

13:41.992 --> 13:44.098
I'm going to visit my father.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.286
How nice.

13:46.335 --> 13:50.156
- I'm going to the Gold Eyes.
- I love James Bond... movies.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.734
Eh... Minor-league baseball team.

13:54.383 --> 13:58.645
- Of course.
- What about you?

14:00.148 --> 14:03.133
There is a reunion at
a high school I barely went to

14:03.182 --> 14:05.827
in a town that I really don't
want to go back to, so...

14:09.494 --> 14:12.578
Anyway, I was just heading
to the bathroom.

14:13.891 --> 14:16.610
So, yeah, have a great weekend.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.426
Joanna Chang.

14:51.655 --> 14:55.141
"In the matter of Kadra Tabar
v. Langway Shipping"

14:55.190 --> 14:56.714
"for wrongful death,"

14:56.839 --> 14:59.110
"we find the defendant not liable."

15:19.616 --> 15:20.954
I'm sorry.

15:21.097 --> 15:22.294
You said we could win.

15:22.343 --> 15:23.774
I don't understand.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.008
We turned down their money.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.217
We'll have a good chance on appeal.

15:26.265 --> 15:27.768
We're very sorry.

16:01.272 --> 16:04.341
- Hey, so much for justice.
- Juries are unpredictable.

16:07.631 --> 16:09.532
I packed up the case files
like you asked.

16:09.581 --> 16:12.786
No. Send the files off.
We won't be handling the appeal.

16:13.047 --> 16:15.685
- Can I get you a coffee?
- No, thank you.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.364
It's no big deal.

16:17.413 --> 16:20.430
We lost a case. It happens, we move on.

16:29.367 --> 16:32.078
The first case of our new firm
and we lose?

16:32.703 --> 16:35.306
Well, things can only get better.

16:35.488 --> 16:37.588
We need a new case, Billy.

16:40.117 --> 16:42.133
Name tags fresh from the printer.

16:42.182 --> 16:44.634
Thank you. Do you think
these t-shirts turned out OK?

16:44.683 --> 16:46.233
Everything's gonna be great.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.317
Everyone's gonna have
a great time. Alright?

16:50.375 --> 16:53.210
Hey, what?

16:55.024 --> 16:58.400
I think I saw
Sam Mercer... in Millwood.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.161
He got released.

17:01.711 --> 17:03.070
You knew?

17:03.156 --> 17:04.890
I had it circled on my calendar.

17:04.939 --> 17:06.623
Parole, good behaviour,
whatever that means.

17:06.672 --> 17:09.659
- And you didn't warn me?!
- I didn't want you to worry.

17:10.580 --> 17:11.907
You uncovered the evidence

17:11.957 --> 17:14.458
that put him in jail,
and then you took his job!

17:14.507 --> 17:16.195
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:19.217 --> 17:23.086
He can't hurt us.
He's not gonna be a problem.

17:25.601 --> 17:27.128
OK?

17:30.018 --> 17:33.245
There's a biotech firm taking
pitches for legal counsel.

17:33.294 --> 17:34.753
We'd have a shot, but your old place,

17:34.802 --> 17:36.541
Steadman Lavery, has the inside track.

17:36.602 --> 17:39.096
- Perfect.
- Then, we were asked

17:39.145 --> 17:41.445
to represent the employees
of the Galbraith School

17:41.506 --> 17:42.706
in a harassment claim.

17:42.755 --> 17:45.073
Bad boss shredded
the HR manager's notes.

17:45.122 --> 17:47.555
- That's great.
- Right now, it's only a consultation.

17:47.604 --> 17:49.905
- Free.
- But could lead to something.

17:50.082 --> 17:52.016
And then, we had
a few website inquiries.

17:52.065 --> 17:53.595
You know, slips and falls,

17:53.644 --> 17:55.712
- personal injury.
- Ambulance chasing.

17:56.088 --> 17:57.608
You know, it's just the end
of our first year;

17:57.656 --> 17:59.489
we have to give it time to grow.

18:00.571 --> 18:03.605
Maybe a few slippage and fallage
would help us pay some bills.

18:04.224 --> 18:06.437
We're OK financially, right?

18:07.661 --> 18:09.358
Billy?

18:09.605 --> 18:12.196
Maybe we were ambitious
taking on two associates.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.835
OK. Then, we let one go.

18:17.713 --> 18:20.644
It isn't Sophie's Choice.
Billy, Cat is better.

18:21.666 --> 18:22.835
Hey, guys!

18:22.884 --> 18:25.382
I just wanted to file
my forms to start work.

18:25.450 --> 18:27.700
You know, so I get
the ball rolling on payroll.

18:27.749 --> 18:29.983
Running on fumes here.

18:31.433 --> 18:34.501
Kind of some negative energy in here.

18:34.742 --> 18:36.228
We lost the case.

18:36.689 --> 18:37.890
I'm sorry.

18:37.939 --> 18:40.009
Cat deals with paperwork.

18:40.532 --> 18:43.639
Oh, uh, hey,
legal favour

18:44.089 --> 18:46.189
uh, is there a way to keep
a certain person

18:46.238 --> 18:48.305
out of a certain area, legally?

18:48.394 --> 18:50.608
You mean like
a restraining order for a place?

18:50.744 --> 18:53.111
Is this a pro bono thing?

18:54.917 --> 18:56.694
Never mind.

18:56.982 --> 18:58.915
See you Monday.

19:02.788 --> 19:04.766
I've been in tougher jams than this.

19:04.923 --> 19:07.991
"Key to firm success
ruthless efficiency."

19:08.211 --> 19:09.985
Is that David Hanley?

19:10.273 --> 19:11.418
Yeah.

19:11.467 --> 19:14.268
My father's firms won cases
and they made money.

19:19.618 --> 19:21.461
Hi! I'm Luna.

19:21.563 --> 19:24.107
Joanna said to give you my forms.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.602
I can't wait to get started.

19:26.887 --> 19:28.410
You're Joanna's sister?

19:28.529 --> 19:31.297
- Yeah.
- That's your desk.

19:34.785 --> 19:36.953
I had to bust my ass
to get my first job;

19:37.836 --> 19:40.690
it must be nice having
a sister with a law firm.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.891
I just... I fast-tracked

19:45.940 --> 19:48.467
my undergraduate degree.
I'm gonna work for a year,

19:48.516 --> 19:50.399
then I'm thinking about writing my LSAT

19:50.448 --> 19:51.657
and applying to law school.

19:51.706 --> 19:53.375
Law school is war.

19:53.431 --> 19:55.821
If you have to think about
applying, you probably shouldn't.

19:56.050 --> 19:57.407
You've already lost.

20:00.821 --> 20:02.293
OK.

20:02.748 --> 20:05.348
I'll see you on Monday.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.139
I worked at Matheson Steel one summer.

20:10.188 --> 20:12.222
You know, the key to beating nepotism

20:12.271 --> 20:13.683
is you work twice as hard to prove

20:13.732 --> 20:15.666
that you deserve
the job you didn't earn.

20:15.814 --> 20:18.114
- And bring free donuts.
- Ohhh!

20:18.163 --> 20:21.187
Yeah. Office people are always
a sucker for free donuts.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.356
You'll win her over.

20:28.734 --> 20:30.149
It's him.

20:31.758 --> 20:33.435
He's stopping.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.676
That's Lilly.

20:36.835 --> 20:39.235
First aid to Dufferin Street, hurry.

20:40.871 --> 20:44.140
How long are we gonna sit by
and keep watching this happen?

20:44.189 --> 20:46.022
Bear Clan is a patrol, not the police.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.362
I'm just a suburban family man.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.374
It's time to call up the bad dudes.

21:09.783 --> 21:11.128
Taylor...

21:15.052 --> 21:16.687
Taylor?

21:17.556 --> 21:19.443
Taylor, hey.

21:19.858 --> 21:21.172
We shouldn't be doing this.

21:21.221 --> 21:22.882
If my mom knew what my dad was up to,

21:22.931 --> 21:24.122
she might have protected me.

21:24.171 --> 21:25.765
Taylor, this isn't what Bear Clan does.

21:25.814 --> 21:27.625
Well then, you can wait in the van.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.714
That's trespassing, hey.

21:47.810 --> 21:50.111
Trust me, you don't want to go to jail.

22:01.671 --> 22:03.414
I'll go to that reunion.

22:03.463 --> 22:05.195
You know it's in Millwood, right?

22:05.244 --> 22:07.091
Diane really wants me to go.

22:10.304 --> 22:12.422
I didn't remember about your father...

22:13.539 --> 22:15.140
I should have.

22:15.896 --> 22:17.443
It isn't important.

22:17.642 --> 22:21.111
- It is.
- I've grieved.

22:21.301 --> 22:23.301
Today is just any other day.

22:23.373 --> 22:26.474
No more rear-view mirror.
Just you and me,

22:26.625 --> 22:28.525
Crawford and Chang.

22:30.494 --> 22:31.999
You know, if we're gonna
make that party,

22:32.048 --> 22:33.981
we should leave "now-ish."

22:39.944 --> 22:43.006
On time isn't late, right?
You drive fast.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.288
Yeah, like the wind.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.554
Then we have time.

23:17.933 --> 23:20.667
I need to make up
next week's Bear Clan schedule;

23:20.792 --> 23:21.941
you're going out?

23:21.990 --> 23:24.034
Yeah, of course, I've gone all year.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.920
You know you don't have to.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.606
I went out when it was minus 40.

23:29.655 --> 23:33.090
I thought you might
want to take a break.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.698
Look, Luna, I know that guy.

23:37.812 --> 23:41.313
Mr. Red Car used to work
for my dad at Matheson Steel.

23:47.450 --> 23:48.964
Why didn't you tell me?

23:49.013 --> 23:51.636
His family came over
to our house for dinner.

23:51.685 --> 23:53.003
I get it, Tay,

23:53.052 --> 23:56.210
but Bear Clan is nonconfrontational.

23:57.104 --> 24:00.399
We can't follow people home;
we're not vigilantes.

24:00.448 --> 24:03.566
You could have put the whole
organization in jeopardy.

24:06.568 --> 24:08.253
What were you thinking?

24:24.642 --> 24:27.798
Oh, Joanna Hanley,
pharmaceutical lawyer, I remember her.

24:27.847 --> 24:29.547
I made a mistake.

24:30.665 --> 24:33.342
So glad you could make it.

24:33.399 --> 24:35.103
Ah, sorry about that.

24:35.152 --> 24:38.088
No, it's fine. It's just
a slight identity crisis.

24:38.293 --> 24:40.546
OK, mingle. I have
a surprise for her. Come.

24:40.603 --> 24:43.313
Come. Come-come-come!

24:43.403 --> 24:47.827
- What is the surprise?
- Aaah, it's more of a who.

24:49.949 --> 24:51.503
Hey.

24:51.654 --> 24:52.923
Kodie.

24:52.972 --> 24:55.308
- In the flesh, baby!
- You look...

24:55.357 --> 24:57.603
If you say "the same,"
you are totally lying.

24:57.652 --> 25:00.556
No, you look great.

25:00.605 --> 25:03.702
Yeah, for a recovering addict,
single mother of two.

25:03.821 --> 25:05.221
You're a big success,

25:05.270 --> 25:06.932
no surprise there.

25:06.981 --> 25:08.619
I've been reading all about you.

25:09.354 --> 25:11.207
I looked for you.

25:11.955 --> 25:14.533
Yeah, well, I've been hard to find.

25:14.603 --> 25:17.380
Some dark days, you know?

25:23.900 --> 25:25.355
Now, there's a sight I miss.

25:25.404 --> 25:27.370
Hey! Good to see you, my friend.

25:29.193 --> 25:31.541
So, Kodie Chartrand.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.721
Yeah, she's been back
in town a few months.

25:33.770 --> 25:34.964
Where has she been?

25:35.033 --> 25:38.020
All around.
Chartrands are still trouble -

25:38.069 --> 25:40.845
guns and drugs...
a pain in my ass, but...

25:40.939 --> 25:43.011
Kodie's really cleaned up her life.

25:43.587 --> 25:46.976
And Diane was so excited about
getting them all back together again.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.631
Those three used
to torment me every recess.

25:51.140 --> 25:53.173
Had to prove they were
smarter than me, which...

25:53.222 --> 25:55.656
they were, obviously.

25:57.207 --> 26:00.466
- Everything alright?
- Yeah, life's good.

26:00.942 --> 26:04.543
You know I interrogate people for a
living; I know when I'm being lied to.

26:05.929 --> 26:09.787
You and Diane,
it's always been easy for you.

26:10.076 --> 26:11.968
You wanna know
the secret to relationships?

26:12.396 --> 26:13.789
Fine.

26:13.838 --> 26:17.540
The secret to
an easy relationship is...

26:17.958 --> 26:19.864
Diane. Date Diane

26:19.913 --> 26:22.100
and at least one of you
will have it all together.

26:23.533 --> 26:26.294
I've been giving
my brother money, probably...

26:26.418 --> 26:29.013
- more than I should have.
- Alright.

26:29.136 --> 26:32.404
Joanna doesn't know.

26:32.524 --> 26:35.296
Well, I come from
a matriarchal society,

26:35.527 --> 26:37.060
so good luck with that.

26:37.216 --> 26:39.497
- Thank you, pretty helpful.
- Yeah, yeah, anytime.

26:39.546 --> 26:41.029
Welcome back,

26:41.078 --> 26:42.967
Millwood High alumni.

26:46.216 --> 26:47.850
Woo!

26:47.939 --> 26:50.411
You know, I'm not just your mayor;

26:50.460 --> 26:54.323
I'm also a former Millwood High
cheer captain. So I say

26:54.372 --> 26:56.179
go, Bulldogs!

27:01.138 --> 27:03.005
A big shout-out
to Principal Diane Evans

27:03.054 --> 27:04.865
of the reunion committee.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.677
First female principal by the way.

27:09.726 --> 27:12.511
Female mayor.
Where's Police Chief Beckbie?

27:12.560 --> 27:13.708
Where is he? There he is.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.826
I'd watch my back, Owen,

27:14.875 --> 27:16.412
if I were you.

27:16.461 --> 27:18.501
Exciting things are
happening here in Millwood.

27:18.550 --> 27:22.633
We've kept our campaign promise
for smaller class sizes,

27:22.682 --> 27:25.895
daycare spaces, and 24-hour access

27:25.944 --> 27:28.688
to medical help through
our MillHealth Help Line!

27:28.737 --> 27:31.038
Yes! Yes!

27:33.929 --> 27:36.598
But there's still so much work to do,

27:36.647 --> 27:38.821
so vote to re-elect

27:38.870 --> 27:42.061
Mayor Alison Shepard
in this fall's election.

27:42.217 --> 27:45.381
Enjoy your weekend.
Enjoy being back in Millwood,

27:45.430 --> 27:47.187
a perfect place to live.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.159
Sam Mercer is back.

28:02.630 --> 28:05.011
He served his sentence,
he's paid his debts,

28:05.060 --> 28:06.960
and no one can stop him
from coming back to Millwood.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.318
I'm gonna be keeping an eye on him.

28:09.428 --> 28:12.016
- If he gets out of line...
- You can't harass him.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.025
We all need to find a way to get along.

28:14.074 --> 28:15.605
Get along with Sam Mercer?

28:15.654 --> 28:17.808
I'm not asking you to have him
over for dinner.

28:18.076 --> 28:20.395
Friends close, enemies closer.

28:22.132 --> 28:23.432
And, Owen,

28:23.481 --> 28:26.349
it's a party, try to have some fun.

28:31.823 --> 28:35.017
That's Madison, she's 12, and...

28:35.066 --> 28:37.533
this is True, she's 7.

28:37.948 --> 28:39.915
That looks like a lot of work.

28:39.971 --> 28:41.513
Yeah, they keep me on my toes,

28:41.586 --> 28:43.281
that's for sure. Haha!

28:43.555 --> 28:46.103
- You don't have any kids?
- Of course not.

28:46.410 --> 28:49.011
Not that I am against them
as a concept;

28:49.060 --> 28:52.128
it's just the idea
of one growing in me.

28:52.211 --> 28:54.463
Hmm... Never?

28:55.228 --> 28:57.600
I have a very busy job.

28:58.054 --> 29:00.336
These two are my busy job.

29:00.418 --> 29:03.806
Greatest job in the world.
I highly recommend it.

29:05.094 --> 29:06.392
Oh!

29:06.656 --> 29:08.154
And as much as I'm loving catching up,

29:08.203 --> 29:10.902
I really should get back to them.

29:12.013 --> 29:14.232
Diane is supposed to drive me home.

29:14.567 --> 29:18.063
Uh... I had a DUI a few years back,

29:18.112 --> 29:21.357
but I'm totally sober now.
That's in my past.

29:21.631 --> 29:23.123
Well, I can drive you.

29:23.172 --> 29:24.600
No, you don't have to, it's fine.

29:24.649 --> 29:25.924
No. No, I want to.

29:25.964 --> 29:28.006
Um, just give me a second.

29:32.035 --> 29:33.146
Hi.

29:33.195 --> 29:35.537
You and Kodie aren't gonna
terrorize me again?

29:35.586 --> 29:37.092
No. We don't have recess anymore.

29:37.141 --> 29:38.729
I'm just gonna drive her home.

29:40.502 --> 29:42.408
A lot happened after you left,

29:42.457 --> 29:43.786
with her and her family.

29:43.843 --> 29:45.810
You don't want to get involved
with the Chartrands.

29:46.029 --> 29:48.774
I'm just gonna drive her home
and come back.

29:49.009 --> 29:51.676
Just be careful, please.

29:52.093 --> 29:54.523
OK. I can take care of myself.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.212
What do we do if the firm fails?

30:04.468 --> 30:07.337
- We start another one.
- I'm serious.

30:08.622 --> 30:10.774
Look, failure
isn't the end of the world.

30:10.837 --> 30:12.704
- I don't fail, Billy.
- I know.

30:12.753 --> 30:13.994
- Ever.
- I get it.

30:14.043 --> 30:16.556
This is the first case
I have ever lost.

30:16.605 --> 30:19.033
You start losing as a lawyer,
people stop calling.

30:19.082 --> 30:21.665
- It's on your Google.
- Your Google is not a thing.

30:21.714 --> 30:23.351
For good or bad, in law,

30:23.400 --> 30:25.760
your reputation is everything.

30:25.938 --> 30:28.224
Well, then let's stop
being lawyers this weekend.

30:28.571 --> 30:31.455
That's who we are, that's in our DNA;

30:31.504 --> 30:32.662
we can't just turn that off.

30:32.711 --> 30:35.898
We can try... really try.

30:39.334 --> 30:42.303
OK, I'll, um... I'll be right back.

30:51.315 --> 30:54.571
I, uh, left in grade 11
and never went back.

30:54.970 --> 30:58.642
- High school dropout.
- You were a great student.

30:58.735 --> 31:00.656
You know, sometimes
even better than you.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.092
Sometimes.

31:03.704 --> 31:07.681
I... went for a meeting
with a guidance counsellor, and...

31:07.908 --> 31:09.814
when I told him
I wanted to go to college,

31:09.863 --> 31:11.949
he said, "Why bother?"

31:13.032 --> 31:14.933
I'm not making excuses.

31:16.339 --> 31:18.307
There was also a handsome boy.

31:18.356 --> 31:21.424
We ran away.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.962
Always wanted to go back and finish,

31:24.011 --> 31:26.243
but then Madison came,

31:26.863 --> 31:28.752
lots of good things.

31:29.913 --> 31:32.116
Lots of things I'd like to do over.

31:32.368 --> 31:33.931
Yeah. Me too.

31:34.277 --> 31:36.751
Yeah, no kidding you
married Billy Crawford.

31:38.282 --> 31:40.845
We are not married.

31:40.937 --> 31:42.522
Never thought he'd be a lawyer.

31:42.571 --> 31:44.890
Yeah, he's full of surprises.

31:45.116 --> 31:46.720
In a good way.

31:49.504 --> 31:51.538
Wouldn't it be great to be 12 again?

31:53.443 --> 31:55.446
I missed you, Jojo.

31:57.060 --> 31:59.571
You should come visit us in the city.

32:01.218 --> 32:03.319
It's hard to get away.

32:03.415 --> 32:06.589
I have a job I gotta hold onto.

32:06.778 --> 32:08.744
But one day at a time, you know.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.908
Yeah.

32:23.001 --> 32:24.861
It's my house.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.908
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

32:27.104 --> 32:28.665
My kids.

32:39.986 --> 32:42.455
- You need to step back.
- What happened?

32:42.527 --> 32:44.367
- My kids are inside, I gotta...
- Ma'am, just calm down.

32:44.584 --> 32:46.066
Your kids are safe.

32:46.143 --> 32:49.571
- Step away. Remain calm.
- True?

32:49.680 --> 32:51.420
True, baby, are you OK?

32:51.469 --> 32:53.255
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.205
Wait, what's going on?
What are you doing with her?

32:58.529 --> 33:01.364
- True!
- Mom!

33:02.063 --> 33:03.966
Madison! Maddie, Maddie, what happened?

33:13.977 --> 33:15.564
Maddie!

33:15.613 --> 33:17.479
Where are you taking them?!

33:17.931 --> 33:19.564
Let me talk to my kid!

33:20.735 --> 33:22.998
I'll be put in a family, she told me.

33:25.222 --> 33:26.825
Stop! No!

34:15.579 --> 34:17.580
I need to see the logs.

34:17.690 --> 34:20.158
I wanna know where
everyone was tonight.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.466
I wasn't informed there was
a child-apprehension warrant.

34:27.819 --> 34:30.500
Just a routine call
from Family Services.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.495
I'd like to be informed.

34:32.922 --> 34:35.246
Under the old chief, we didn't do that.

34:35.485 --> 34:38.067
That was the old way.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.996
You're the boss.

34:43.663 --> 34:45.321
It was Millwood PD.

34:45.503 --> 34:48.024
They've been watching me.
They waited for me to be out.

34:48.072 --> 34:49.157
The police?

34:49.206 --> 34:51.766
Owen's the chief,
it couldn't be the police.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.469
This is Millwood Family Services.

34:53.518 --> 34:54.886
I've dealt with them at the school.

34:54.935 --> 34:57.447
The police have to attend
all child apprehensions.

34:57.575 --> 34:59.641
It says here there should be
a hearing within a week.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.160
A week?

35:01.634 --> 35:04.602
They take your kids if
they believe they're in danger.

35:04.664 --> 35:07.235
- They weren't in danger.
- Who was here with your kids?

35:07.305 --> 35:09.960
Madison. But she's 12 going on 30.

35:10.009 --> 35:11.969
It's legal to leave your kids
with a 12 year old.

35:12.018 --> 35:13.858
And I was only gone for an hour.

35:13.907 --> 35:16.180
I know my Madison, they were safe.

35:16.229 --> 35:18.505
They have to act on all complaints.

35:18.857 --> 35:20.672
Who made a complaint?

35:25.090 --> 35:28.025
Madison broke her arm a while back.

35:28.530 --> 35:31.570
It was an accident,
she fell down the stairs.

35:31.667 --> 35:34.001
I didn't do what people said I did.

35:35.866 --> 35:39.203
They've made a mistake.
I've done everything right!

35:40.853 --> 35:42.439
Maybe we can challenge it.

35:42.796 --> 35:46.196
- Tonight?
- Please.

35:47.155 --> 35:48.412
You're the best.

35:48.461 --> 35:50.628
She can do the impossible.

35:52.437 --> 35:54.738
I was a transactional lawyer,

35:54.787 --> 35:57.622
corporate law, big deals,
mergers and acquisitions,

35:57.671 --> 35:59.456
private offerings,
securitized investments,

35:59.505 --> 36:02.239
I was good at it, I liked it.

36:02.733 --> 36:04.078
I like credit derivatives and,

36:04.127 --> 36:06.078
to a lesser extent, commodity swaps.

36:06.134 --> 36:08.520
They make sense to me.
I can do those deals,

36:08.569 --> 36:10.858
I... can do them perfectly.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.419
But a case like this...

36:16.374 --> 36:18.921
families... kid...

36:19.078 --> 36:21.045
Just need a second.

36:38.788 --> 36:42.458
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:43.884 --> 36:45.257
We can just go home.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.668
I'll find you a nice...

36:47.717 --> 36:50.117
credit-derivative case to work on.

36:53.681 --> 36:55.088
Hey.

37:11.746 --> 37:13.090
No.

37:15.804 --> 37:18.139
We go wake up a judge.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.058
- Can I help you?
- Your Honour,

37:32.107 --> 37:33.833
Joanna Chang, Billy Crawford.

37:33.882 --> 37:35.022
We would like to request

37:35.071 --> 37:36.271
an emergency order,

37:36.320 --> 37:39.232
to halt the unlawful apprehension
of our client's children.

37:39.325 --> 37:41.497
There'll be an hearing in
a week, we can sort it out then.

37:41.546 --> 37:42.872
No, without an emergency order,

37:42.921 --> 37:44.361
our client and her children

37:44.421 --> 37:47.608
will suffer permanent
irreparable and immediate harm.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.196
Ms. Chang,

37:49.245 --> 37:50.513
I appreciate your verve,

37:50.562 --> 37:52.576
but there's no such thing
as an emergency order

37:52.625 --> 37:54.395
- in a child-apprehension case.
- Your Honour...

37:54.444 --> 37:57.271
You can't simply make up the
law, Ms. Chang.

37:57.495 --> 38:00.043
The police and Child Services
entered the home,

38:00.092 --> 38:02.589
and they removed the children forcibly

38:02.681 --> 38:06.042
in violation of their rights
under section 8 of the Charter.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.176
There's no charter protection
from search and seizure

38:08.225 --> 38:09.700
in child-apprehension cases.

38:13.054 --> 38:14.646
Well, there should be.

38:15.285 --> 38:18.721
The penalty can't come before
the right to defend yourself.

38:18.770 --> 38:21.924
Are you asking me to overrule a
Supreme Court decision in a bathrobe?

38:21.973 --> 38:24.637
Well, it was wrongly decided, so yes.

38:24.686 --> 38:27.342
If the seizure was unlawful,
the hearing will address it.

38:27.391 --> 38:29.452
- I'm going back to bed.
- But...

38:30.711 --> 38:33.102
Those children can't be all alone.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.204
I'll move up the hearing.

38:38.253 --> 38:39.923
48 hours, that's the best I can do.

38:39.972 --> 38:41.485
And you better be ready.

38:41.742 --> 38:43.487
If your client loses at that hearing,

38:43.680 --> 38:45.422
she could lose her kids forever.

38:56.430 --> 38:58.365
The spare room's yours
as long as you need it.

38:58.751 --> 39:00.563
Just until my kids are home.

39:00.612 --> 39:02.282
48 hours.

39:02.376 --> 39:04.524
There'll be a hearing and
then we'll have a chance

39:04.573 --> 39:06.425
to argue why you should
get your kids back.

39:06.492 --> 39:08.278
We shouldn't have to argue that.

39:08.327 --> 39:10.102
It sounds crazy, but there is no

39:10.151 --> 39:12.351
absolute legal right
to raise your own kids.

39:12.435 --> 39:16.475
In this case, you are guilty
until proven innocent.

39:17.422 --> 39:20.078
I should get to work,
figure out the case against you.

39:20.127 --> 39:22.394
- We should all get some rest.
- I'm not tired.

39:22.544 --> 39:24.277
I can't sleep.

39:25.932 --> 39:29.000
- What if we lose?
- Joanna won't lose.

39:31.178 --> 39:33.045
Hello?

39:35.299 --> 39:36.688
Good evening, everyone.

39:36.737 --> 39:38.101
Oh, this isn't good.

39:38.252 --> 39:41.860
Looks like the attending
officer was Tommy Heath.

39:41.992 --> 39:43.602
One of Mercer's pals.

39:43.651 --> 39:46.608
Yeah, they've been
after my family for years, but...

39:46.657 --> 39:48.271
Why are they targeting me?

39:48.516 --> 39:50.907
- Could they have done this?
- It could be.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.756
Sam Mercer is back in town,
we need to be prepared for anything.

39:55.016 --> 39:57.158
But there was an apprehension warrant.

39:59.145 --> 40:00.399
"There was reasonable belief,"

40:00.447 --> 40:02.313
"the children of Kodie
Chartrand are at risk"

40:02.370 --> 40:04.123
"of serious and immediate harm,"

40:04.172 --> 40:05.638
"due to parental neglect."

40:06.507 --> 40:08.391
I'm sorry.

40:08.578 --> 40:10.203
I believe you.

40:10.384 --> 40:11.744
We're gonna figure out who did this,

40:11.793 --> 40:14.174
and we won't stop until
we get your kids back.

40:22.875 --> 40:25.959
What if none of it ever gets
solved in the North End?

40:26.227 --> 40:28.182
Then, it's still worth trying.

40:29.251 --> 40:30.642
Louis Riel said

40:30.691 --> 40:32.665
our people would sleep
for a hundred years,

40:32.714 --> 40:33.866
but then we'd wake up.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.814
A hundred years is a long time.

40:35.863 --> 40:37.979
We have to play the long game.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.579
How are you not angry all the time?

40:43.510 --> 40:45.509
Anger is about the past.

40:45.558 --> 40:46.923
You can choose not to have it.

40:47.001 --> 40:48.665
See? I don't agree with that

40:48.854 --> 40:52.464
because then you just push it
deeper, but it's still there.

40:55.722 --> 40:57.313
I'm going to bed.

40:57.362 --> 41:00.235
I left the money for
the Hydro bill on the counter.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.485
Promise me...

41:05.134 --> 41:07.166
if you walk with Bear Clan,
you follow our rules.

41:09.621 --> 41:10.910
Hmm.

41:55.609 --> 41:57.258
So, we're staying?

41:57.385 --> 41:59.142
Just for 48 hours, I promise.

41:59.344 --> 42:00.806
We should let someone else take this.

42:00.855 --> 42:02.469
She needs us.

42:02.923 --> 42:04.563
Our firm needs us.

42:04.781 --> 42:05.899
It's important,

42:05.948 --> 42:07.947
it's just two days, and I owe her.

42:08.050 --> 42:09.634
Why?

42:09.852 --> 42:11.695
She was there for me

42:12.192 --> 42:14.225
a long time ago, Billy.

42:15.274 --> 42:16.615
Cat, hi.

42:16.664 --> 42:18.470
Uh, no need to call me back.

42:18.519 --> 42:21.326
Billy and I are away
for a couple of days on a case.

42:21.509 --> 42:24.243
And you are doing a good job.

42:25.325 --> 42:26.765
Also,

42:26.814 --> 42:28.992
I need you to fire Rylan for me.

42:29.118 --> 42:30.715
Thanks.

42:33.391 --> 42:34.887
You're sure we're not just
hanging out here

42:34.936 --> 42:36.551
'cause we lost the trial?

42:37.077 --> 42:38.944
You've been pushing to go
on summer vacation.

42:38.993 --> 42:41.445
- This counts?
- Yes. We are out of the city.

42:41.494 --> 42:43.460
On a child-apprehension case.

42:46.699 --> 42:49.802
Our case, Kadra...

42:50.852 --> 42:53.258
... I didn't cross the line,

42:53.307 --> 42:55.203
and it cost us the trial.

42:57.065 --> 42:58.725
We're lawyers,

42:58.774 --> 43:00.865
we are paid to win.

43:01.211 --> 43:02.781
Nothing else matters.

43:03.197 --> 43:05.611
That's Joanna Hanley talking.

43:08.563 --> 43:10.531
I love you, Billy.

43:11.700 --> 43:13.328
And I love you too...

43:14.617 --> 43:16.361
whoever you are.
