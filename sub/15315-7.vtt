00:23.840 --> 00:26.040
That's the last drop.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.920
God help us.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.040
Do you know, I don't know
who's hotter, you or me.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.600
Oh, it's you, sire.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.760
You are hot...

00:43.800 --> 00:45.560
hot...

00:47.440 --> 00:48.720
..hot.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.240
- If we could get back to the business in hand, sire.
- Do we have to?

00:54.800 --> 00:57.200
I think I'll leave you to it.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.200
- Good evening.
- Oh, God! Don't do that!

01:11.760 --> 01:15.080
Sorry. Just thought I'd pop in on you.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.800
I, um...

01:19.640 --> 01:21.680
..thought you might like some of these.

01:21.720 --> 01:26.120
- I need to make arrangements.
-Oh, do stop whinging, Gisborne.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.760
I've told you, you're as
good as sheriff already.

01:29.800 --> 01:34.680
The only thing you don't have is the
title or the power...or the castle.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.920
But the truth is, right now,
there are more pressing matters.

01:37.960 --> 01:41.760
- Robin Hood.
- Now, obviously, he has to hang.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.520
The only problem is, the people do
rather insist on adoring him still.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.240
- The people are fools, sire.
-Of course they are.

01:48.280 --> 01:53.520
But we need their co-operation if my
plans for England are to come to fruition.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.960
So...I need to woo them.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.360
Make them love me.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.200
Yes, sire. But how?

02:02.240 --> 02:05.000
By giving them what
they want, of course.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.320
What they want more than
anything with this drought.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.840
Water.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.280
Mmm...

02:23.320 --> 02:24.960
Juicy.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.080
Prepare the horses! I wish to leave!

02:28.120 --> 02:29.640
Good night, Isabella.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.880
Good night, Robin Hood.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.360
You'll accompany me on my
trip back to the castle.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.960
We'll visit the dungeons.

03:38.920 --> 03:43.080
Don't be scared, my dear. I
just want to show you something.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.280
Kindred spirits, you and I.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.400
Now, usually the water in
here comes halfway to the top,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.480
but my men are blocking
the spring that feeds it.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.080
The same spring supplies the
underground water sources in Nottingham.

04:00.120 --> 04:05.240
Within the hour, every well within a ten-mile
radius will be without water in this drought,

04:05.280 --> 04:10.000
which is when I shall start giving them
water from my own personal supplies.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.720
And then, Isabella,

04:12.760 --> 04:16.040
then they shall realise
it is me they should adore,

04:16.079 --> 04:19.200
Me they should worship and obey,

04:19.240 --> 04:22.320
Me who is their kind
and merciful father.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.560
What if they don't?

04:24.600 --> 04:27.920
Well, then the filthy little
wretches can die of thirst.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.760
Nothing.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.840
- I'm sorry.
- Have some of mine.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.640
- But you need it, too.
- Come on.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.880
Take it, Ellie... for my godson.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.640
I've missed you so much!

04:52.680 --> 04:55.400
- How's the little tyke doing?
- Oh, you know,

04:55.440 --> 05:00.000
tears, tantrums, fouling his
pants... but enough about my husband.

05:01.360 --> 05:05.120
We'll get through this
drought, Kate. I know we will.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.880
Change is coming, Robin.

05:06.920 --> 05:11.680
Is it, now? I'm beginning to wonder
if we can really change anything.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.000
The Sheriff is dead
- is that not change enough?

05:14.040 --> 05:18.400
In his place is the Prince who does
nothing while his people die of thirst.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.800
- Thank goodness for me, then.
- Your recce went well?

05:20.840 --> 05:24.280
Two guards, one door and twenty barrels

05:24.320 --> 05:27.680
of Prince John's cool,
fresh water hidden in a barn,

05:27.720 --> 05:29.600
just begging to be sampled.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.240
I don't believe it.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.160
There's no point resisting it!

05:33.200 --> 05:36.880
I saw them
- they were all over each other.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.840
Sire, is it possible that you
could have misread the situation?

05:42.240 --> 05:47.840
Well, we'll see, won't we?
Because I've set her a little trap.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.680
- A trap?
- Mmm.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.160
I told her about my plan with the
water. If she is in league with Hood,

05:53.200 --> 05:55.680
I suspect she'll want
to tell him all about it,

05:55.720 --> 05:59.520
and when she does, you'll be
there, because you'll be following.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.680
And then?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.560
What do you expect?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.920
They're traitors. Execute them.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.040
Both of them?

06:11.760 --> 06:15.400
Gisborne, I have great plans for you.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.200
I do hope you're not suffering

06:18.240 --> 06:22.040
from any pathetic pangs
of familial loyalty.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.600
None at all.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.800
My loyalty to you is absolute.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.320
Whatever the outcome, it shall be
my hand that resolves it for you,

06:30.360 --> 06:33.280
- and I promise you...
- Yes, bored now. Leave, please.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.320
Help me, please.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.680
- Help me.
- Naff off!

06:58.720 --> 07:03.400
This drought's made me so thirsty
that... I need water, please.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.880
There's no water here for you.

07:05.920 --> 07:10.760
- I'm parched, sir. Please.
- Get lost!

07:10.800 --> 07:13.680
Just a little to wet my mouth, then, eh?

07:13.720 --> 07:16.480
It's as dry as a camel's
bum in a sandstorm.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.880
You're giving me the hump! Now push off.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.640
There's no water here for you.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.320
Really?

07:22.360 --> 07:24.120
Well, what's all this, then?

07:27.240 --> 07:28.600
And again!

07:34.360 --> 07:37.720
I mean, really, it's not like I
asked for ice and a slice, was it?

07:37.760 --> 07:40.720
Come on, let's get this
water to the villages.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.920
Thank you.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.680
Thank you.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.400
Ssh, ssh, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.640
Thank you.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.760
-So what's his name, then?
-Actually, his name's Robin.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.680
Is it? Oh, thank you very
much, that's very flattering.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.680
No, after the bird.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.640
One landed on his crib
the day he was born.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.960
Course it did. Right, good, good.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.080
Joke. It was after you.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.240
He's always been a poorly lad, so we
thought we'd give him a name of strength.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.840
Hello.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.840
Let's have some water.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.480
Hey!

08:32.520 --> 08:34.559
- What's wrong?
- Oh...

08:36.799 --> 08:38.320
I envy them, Much.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.000
You know, they have nothing,

08:41.039 --> 08:43.960
and yet I envy them
their lives, because...

08:44.000 --> 08:46.080
That's better!

08:46.120 --> 08:49.200
..they have each other, you know?

08:49.240 --> 08:52.560
Well, we've got each other.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.680
It's not the same, though, is it?

08:54.720 --> 08:56.440
No.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.960
It's not.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.360
KATE: Robin?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.280
What is it?

09:07.040 --> 09:10.320
Isabella just spoke to me
as I was passing the manor.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.400
She said she had important
information for you.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.200
She wants to meet you in the meadow.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.920
Right, OK.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.280
I'm going to have to leave you awhile.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.520
Just had a message from Isabella.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.200
I think she may have
information about the well.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.080
You think that's wise?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.840
Come on, Tuck, we've been through this.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.400
My gut still tells me there's
something not right about her.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.760
- She helped us before.
- She helped us put out the fire.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.920
She's Gisborne's sister. You think
she doesn't have ulterior motives?

09:37.960 --> 09:40.400
Or maybe you think she just
likes you for being you.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.160
The truth is, Robin Hood is needed here.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.120
The water in these barrels will last
each village a day or so at most.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.040
Soon the very old and the
very young will start dying.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.640
That's exactly why I
should go and meet her.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.600
If she has information
about the wells...

09:52.640 --> 09:55.160
- I hear there's water in the Trent.
- And I hear that there isn't.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.040
And even if I'm wrong, it's
still only a temporary solution.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.160
We need something permanent,
and Isabella may offer us that.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.560
- I'll be back. Wait for me here.
- Robin!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.320
Wait here.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.720
Well, I am punctual... if nothing else.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.560
You have to stop doing that.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.040
So...

10:34.080 --> 10:38.080
what's so important that you'd
risk being seen with me in public?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.680
Prince John's blocked the spring

10:40.720 --> 10:43.120
that provides the water
supply to the villages.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.880
We have to find a way of unblocking
the spring, then, don't we?

10:45.920 --> 10:50.080
There's another entrance to the chamber
via an overflow outside the town.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.920
One of the guardstold me about it.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.680
It eventually leads to the chamber
underneath the castle dungeons.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.800
If we go in that way, we can
bypass the castle completely.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.200
What do you mean..."we"?

11:02.480 --> 11:05.160
I mean I can take you there myself.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.160
Would you?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.760
And lead me straight
into the dragon's lair.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.600
What do I have to do
to make you trust me?

11:12.640 --> 11:16.880
I'm not my brother, Robin. Look, I have
no interest in being on the losing side.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.680
So this is a politically motivated act.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.360
Call it what you want.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.720
Political manoeuvring...

11:25.760 --> 11:28.360
undermining my louse of a brother...

11:29.840 --> 11:32.240
..a naked attempt...

11:32.280 --> 11:34.200
to get you to like me more.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.600
You can trust me, I swear.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.400
Right.

11:48.440 --> 11:53.320
Well, we have to go
back and get the others,

11:53.360 --> 11:56.160
because we're going to need
all the help we can get.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.720
All right? And then we'll
go straight to the entrance.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.000
Now, come on.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.800
Come on!

12:09.040 --> 12:12.240
Horses! Run! Go!

12:15.000 --> 12:16.320
Good morning!

12:23.720 --> 12:26.400
Good morning to you all, my, er...

12:26.440 --> 12:28.480
my children.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.280
I know you've been
suffering, and when you hurt,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.440
I hurt.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.960
Which is why I am here
now to dispense succour,

12:37.000 --> 12:43.120
quench your thirst and to give you
the gift of life itself, through water.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.800
Water for every...

12:50.080 --> 12:52.600
Where did you get that?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.040
Huh?

13:03.960 --> 13:05.640
You see...

13:05.680 --> 13:07.560
this water...

13:07.600 --> 13:09.840
is mine.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.920
So...

13:12.960 --> 13:15.200
where did you get it?

13:15.240 --> 13:16.600
Hood, sire.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.680
Of course.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.520
Hood.

13:22.560 --> 13:26.000
Men, give this man a drink.

13:26.040 --> 13:26.960
Come here!

13:32.120 --> 13:34.360
I really wouldn't.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.760
You've seen already
how your treachery pays.

13:38.800 --> 13:44.040
You like my water so much, from now on you pay for it
- a penny a gallon.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.480
But sire, we don't
have that sort of money.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.360
Well, sell something -

13:48.400 --> 13:52.160
some grain, a cow, a grandparent
- I don't care.

13:52.200 --> 13:57.920
- My baby needs water to live, sire.
- Yes, on that we both agree.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.840
If you won't love me,
then by God you'll fear me!

14:23.040 --> 14:25.160
What have we done?

14:27.960 --> 14:31.720
What do you think your brother would
say if he knew we were together?

14:31.760 --> 14:34.160
Guy still wet the bed when he was 12.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.200
- He doesn't scare me.
- Yeah?

14:36.240 --> 14:39.480
I'll be sure to mention that
to him the next time I see him.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.480
- What the...
- Gisborne!

14:43.520 --> 14:45.200
How could you do this to me, Isabella?

14:45.240 --> 14:47.160
- What is this?
- Robin...

14:47.200 --> 14:48.760
- You tricked me!
- I didn't trick you...

14:48.800 --> 14:49.840
- With him!?
- ..I swear.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.600
- How could he know where we were?
- You're my sister!

14:51.640 --> 14:52.720
He must have followed me.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.400
- Liar!
- He's an outlaw, a murderer...

14:54.440 --> 14:56.200
- Would he shackle me if I'd known?
- ..a traitor!

14:56.240 --> 14:59.360
You kissed me. You made me believe
that we may have a future together.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.600
- You swore you'd never see him again!
- Guy, let me go!

15:02.640 --> 15:05.840
You are my brother. You will let me go.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.000
Please, Guy.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.240
All right,

15:14.280 --> 15:16.400
I will.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.560
I'll give you another chance, Isabella.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.840
I mean, we all make mistakes, don't we?

15:20.880 --> 15:24.760
What a shame you didn't show that compassion
to Marian before you ran her through.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.200
Shut it!

15:28.360 --> 15:32.240
So...I will unshackle you...

15:32.280 --> 15:33.800
- Thank you.
- ..on one condition.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.600
Why is there always
one condition with you?

15:36.640 --> 15:40.600
Prove to me that you understand
the terrible error you have made.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.520
Kill him...

15:45.120 --> 15:47.680
..in front of me...

15:48.800 --> 15:50.160
..with this.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.040
If you do that, I will
lie to Prince John.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.920
What does he know?

15:56.960 --> 16:00.240
I will tell him that he
misread what he saw last night,

16:00.280 --> 16:03.040
and your life will be spared.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.120
Oh, just do it.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.480
You're a rubbish kisser anyway. Just save
us all the pretence and do it quickly.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.920
It'll make his day.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.480
Fine! I will, then.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.040
You were right.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.600
It was obviously a mistake having
anything to do with this weasel.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.920
Unshackle me

16:36.960 --> 16:40.080
and I'll put things right.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.599
You were going to do it!

17:23.640 --> 17:26.599
What are you talking
about? I was tricking him.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.280
- I helped you fight him!
- That was helping me?!

17:29.320 --> 17:31.880
- I gave you the stick, you fool!
- Gave it to me?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.840
- I took it from you!
- Oh, yeah, course you did,

17:33.880 --> 17:36.440
- because you are so perfect!
- Oh, shut up!

17:44.400 --> 17:45.840
What are you doing?

17:45.880 --> 17:48.600
What I've wanted to do for 17 years.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.480
- Consigning him to hell.
- Isabella...

17:51.520 --> 17:53.920
once you do it, there's no going back.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.880
There's nothing more to be said or done.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.920
This will do all the talking I need.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa! And what
about what HE may have to say?

18:00.760 --> 18:04.320
The only thing I ever
wanted to hear from him

18:04.360 --> 18:06.840
was a plea for forgiveness -

18:06.880 --> 18:11.120
some admission of guilt that it
was his fault that I was so unhappy.

18:14.640 --> 18:19.520
He sold his own sister to a
man who made my life a misery.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.800
That's why you shouldn't
let him off so easily.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.000
Come on,

18:28.040 --> 18:29.920
give it to me.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.200
You will pay.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.760
Some day, you will pay.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.920
Get the key.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.240
Great(!)

18:56.280 --> 18:57.800
Oh, no!

18:57.840 --> 19:03.960
Look, it's OK, we're fine. We'll go to Clun. It's
nearer than the camp and there'll be a blacksmith there.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.840
Take it back.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.040
Take what back?

19:08.080 --> 19:10.400
The bit about being a
rubbish kisser. Take it back.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.240
Fine, you're not a rubbish kisser.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.240
- So why did you say it?
- To make you angry.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.000
We need to tie him up.

19:20.560 --> 19:24.080
It's a fine line, isn't
it, between love and hate?

19:26.240 --> 19:28.280
Two sides of the same coin, really.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.040
Maybe they need to truly hate me

19:32.080 --> 19:35.160
before they can understand
how to truly love me.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.160
A penny a gallon.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.920
And put guards on all the
roads to the River Trent.

19:44.960 --> 19:48.880
Any water in there is
now requisitioned by me...

19:48.920 --> 19:51.120
for the good of the nation.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.440
Clun's this way.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.080
ROBIN: It's this way.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.920
I know which way it is.

20:03.960 --> 20:07.720
Isabella, I live in the
forest. I know Clun is this way.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.280
Oh, right. You think I'm going to
lead you into another trap, right?

20:11.320 --> 20:13.880
Fine, we'll go your way.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.680
- Well, if you think your way...
- No, no, no.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.920
- ..we can go your way.
- No, really.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.240
Isabella, I am letting
you have your own way.

20:21.280 --> 20:25.080
Surely you can't get angry with me for
letting you have your own way, can you?

20:25.120 --> 20:27.760
You've not been out with
many women, have you?

20:27.800 --> 20:30.440
There are people who need our
help and they need it fast.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.440
We can go whichever way you
want, all right? But just decide.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.160
Fine.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.600
How long has he been this ill?

20:47.640 --> 20:49.760
Since the water ran out.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.520
It's just a fever.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.920
He's going to be fine.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.040
Absolutely.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.200
- We need to do something.
- Robin told us to wait here.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.080
That baby has a few hours at the
most. His temperature is raging.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.800
All the wells and springs
around Nottingham have dried up.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.960
We need to go to the river.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.400
- And take the weaker ones with us.
- Yes.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.160
But what if there is no water there?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.320
What if Robin is solving
the problem with the wells?

21:24.360 --> 21:27.120
If we stay here and the water
returns, then everything's sorted.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.920
That's three ifs. We need to make
a decision based on what we know,

21:29.960 --> 21:33.760
and we know that people will
die unless we take action now.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.720
Isabella, tell me where the entrance is. I'll try
to get to the spring source and clear it on my own.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.800
- You can still try and escape.
- Escape? To where?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.000
My brother was my protector.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.120
Without him, I have nothing.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.760
You have me.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.640
What was she like?

22:34.680 --> 22:36.840
What was who like?

22:36.880 --> 22:39.760
The woman that my brother killed.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.560
She was Marian.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.800
Well, she must have been
a pretty special woman,

22:50.840 --> 22:53.440
to have such a hold
over you and my brother.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.680
She never gave your brother a
reason to feel anything for her.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.240
And you?

23:04.360 --> 23:06.520
I just want to forget.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
Hey!

23:15.880 --> 23:18.760
Hey, come on
- we're nearly there.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.800
When I was in Anatolia,

23:42.840 --> 23:44.720
when we were really desperate,

23:44.760 --> 23:47.160
we'd find a lizard and squeeze it

23:47.200 --> 23:50.640
until the contents of its
bladder emptied into our mouths.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.840
What did you squeezeif you were hungry?

23:53.960 --> 23:56.000
Perhaps we should turn back, Tuck.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.360
There is no way we are turning back.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.640
Keep your heads down
and your weapons hidden.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.400
John.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.120
- Good day to you, my son.
- No way through today.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.320
Trent's water is
requisitioned by the Crown.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.120
We need water now.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.960
Plenty available at the
castle, penny a gallon,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.440
unless you're not welcome there.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.160
Hello, Tuck!

24:35.440 --> 24:37.680
HORSES GALLOPING

24:38.920 --> 24:41.680
Run! Get in the trees!

24:41.720 --> 24:43.720
Move!

25:01.760 --> 25:03.640
That was close.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.120
Where's Kate?

25:28.640 --> 25:31.120
That's the trap door to the dungeons.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.720
And that's where the
water flows to the wells.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.560
The spring is somewhere under there.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.000
Right.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.080
Best get started, then, eh?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.920
I need four men to go
to the overflow entrance

25:49.960 --> 25:51.880
and block the chamber. Now!

25:51.920 --> 25:54.840
GUARD: You heard him! Move! Move!

26:00.560 --> 26:01.800
Come on!

26:03.800 --> 26:04.840
Nearly there!

26:14.760 --> 26:16.520
Wait!

26:23.960 --> 26:25.840
Your brother must have escaped.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.120
You guess right.

26:30.360 --> 26:35.280
- Guy, what are you doing?
- My duty to Prince John.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.440
Executing a traitor...

26:37.480 --> 26:39.600
and his accomplice.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.840
Executing us?

26:44.120 --> 26:48.400
Now that all the exits are
blocked, you're both going to drown.

26:50.800 --> 26:55.520
The chamber will fill pretty quickly
and you'll try to tread water.

26:55.560 --> 26:59.440
You might manage a few hours
- maybe even a day - who knows?

26:59.480 --> 27:02.640
But in the end, you'll
just run out of energy.

27:02.680 --> 27:06.640
I swear, if I get out of
here alive, I will kill you!

27:06.680 --> 27:09.680
Swear all you like, Hood,
it won't make any difference.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.920
The legend dies here,

27:11.960 --> 27:14.800
slowly and painfully,I would imagine.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.320
Meanwhile, I get to be Sheriff.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.600
Life is sweet, isn't it?

27:25.720 --> 27:26.800
Gisborne!

27:28.080 --> 27:31.640
- Gisborne!
- Save your breath. I know him.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.320
He won't be coming back.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.520
You're a pretty little
thing, aren't you?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.400
And you're the devil!

27:47.440 --> 27:48.960
Feisty, too.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.680
Hood certainly likes his
ladies spirited, doesn't he?

27:51.720 --> 27:54.040
I bet he loves Isabella.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.520
- Isabella?
- Oh, come on, spill the beans.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.360
Has she turned up yet
with an urgent message?

28:02.520 --> 28:03.920
Robin can't stand Isabella.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.480
Why on earth would he have
anything to do with her?

28:06.520 --> 28:08.760
Oh, how sweet! You're jealous.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.880
I am not jealous of her!

28:14.240 --> 28:16.400
Why should Hoody have all the fun?

28:17.400 --> 28:21.280
Why don't you go down
and relax in the dungeons?

28:21.320 --> 28:27.720
I'll pop down later for a
little chat, a deux, as it were.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.440
If I'd just seen them take
her, I would've gone back.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.000
I would've.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.360
I just...

28:36.760 --> 28:38.680
I'd do anything for her.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.160
Here!

28:40.200 --> 28:41.360
Here.

28:45.480 --> 28:46.840
There.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.280
Thank you.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.000
- It's bitter, but it's quite safe.
- Tuck.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.520
- Here we go.
- Here.

28:57.320 --> 29:01.880
This is good, but it won't keep them
going for long. What do we do now?

29:16.760 --> 29:18.400
Well?

29:18.440 --> 29:21.040
She was as you suspected.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.800
- She followed Hood?
- She did.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.400
And?

29:29.920 --> 29:32.480
- And I solved the problem, sire.
- Oh, please,

29:32.520 --> 29:35.600
don't get all enigmatic on
me, Gisborne. Are they dead?

29:38.120 --> 29:39.440
Yes.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.320
Well, have a drink, man.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.160
It's not every day you can celebrate

29:45.200 --> 29:48.560
killing a national treasure
and one's own sister.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.160
I don't want a drink, sire.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.080
I merely ask that you fulfil
your side of the bargain.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.200
You're right.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.600
You're owed that much,
at least. There you are.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.880
The keys to Nottingham.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.080
My lords, ladies,

30:15.120 --> 30:20.200
never let it be said that I am a man
who does not deliver on his promises.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.720
Robin Hood...is dead...

30:25.520 --> 30:28.760
..executed by my loyal friend here.

30:28.800 --> 30:32.600
My lords and ladies, I give
you Sir Guy of Gisborne,

30:32.640 --> 30:35.520
the new Sheriff of Nottingham!

30:35.560 --> 30:38.240
ALL: Sheriff of Nottingham!

30:52.080 --> 30:53.840
So go on, do tell.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.400
Did they squeal?

31:07.240 --> 31:10.680
I tried to shift the stone
blocking the overflow.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.240
It's too heavy.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.560
Would you mind holding me? I'm freezing.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.200
Here...

31:19.360 --> 31:22.160
We must be the only two
people in the whole of England

31:22.200 --> 31:24.520
who are cold and wet right now.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.040
You know...

31:35.000 --> 31:37.960
- ..I had a dream about you and me.
- Did you?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.160
What was it?

31:41.680 --> 31:45.120
I dreamt that we...we lived together.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.800
We lived in a...in a farmhouse,

31:50.840 --> 31:54.080
had a few animals,
grew all our own food.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.280
And we had children.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.880
How many?

32:01.920 --> 32:03.400
Four.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.720
Two girls, two boys.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.440
Freckles on their little knees.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.680
The boys had your strength
and your courage...

32:16.720 --> 32:18.480
And the girls your brains?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.720
We were so happy.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.600
You probably think it's ridiculous.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.840
No.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.840
It sounds...

32:35.240 --> 32:37.040
..sort of perfect.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.800
What's that?

32:44.840 --> 32:46.040
What?

32:47.160 --> 32:49.480
There, that's a ring.
Take your dress off.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
What?

32:50.560 --> 32:55.160
Take your dress off. I can make a rope.
I can get an arrow through that ring.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.720
We can get out of here, Isabella.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.760
Yeah, sounds so simple,

33:00.800 --> 33:03.920
getting a tiny little arrow
through that tiny ring(!)

33:03.960 --> 33:05.640
You're forgetting one thing.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.920
What?

33:06.960 --> 33:09.320
I'm Robin Hood.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.480
How much further to the river, Tuck?

33:13.520 --> 33:18.040
We're nearly there, very
nearly. I can feel it.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.160
Ah!

33:20.200 --> 33:22.080
Hey!

33:23.680 --> 33:25.720
- Look, let me carry him.
-No.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.520
ROBIN: Hold on, Isabella.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.360
Where's the bow?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.960
All right? All right...

33:43.000 --> 33:44.760
hold on...

34:15.360 --> 34:16.520
Yes!

34:20.440 --> 34:21.920
I told you I'd do it!

34:23.880 --> 34:27.840
Right. I'll climb up first, and
then I'll pull you up, all right?

34:40.080 --> 34:45.480
I've got one of Hood's gang downstairs
- a girl, would you believe? You'd like her.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.920
- Fancy a gander?
- The perfect end to a perfect day.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.360
Reach!

35:48.080 --> 35:50.520
- I've got you.
- Ah!

35:50.560 --> 35:52.200
Come on.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.920
Come on!

36:02.120 --> 36:04.240
Come on! Come on!

36:05.680 --> 36:07.680
Thank you, thank you so much!

36:07.720 --> 36:10.240
- Thank you!
- We're not safe yet.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.720
- Careful. Watch out.
- KATE: Robin!

36:14.080 --> 36:15.960
Kate?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.080
What happened?

36:19.120 --> 36:22.760
We tried to get to the river, but
I got caught. You can't trust her.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.360
Robin! We've got to get out of here.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.320
It's only a matter of time
before someone comes down.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.840
I can't just leave her, Isabella.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.240
- We've got a chance to escape...
- Robin!

36:32.280 --> 36:35.600
..to escape our old lives.
We've got to take this chance.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.040
Listen!

36:38.160 --> 36:40.560
What we talked about down there,

36:40.600 --> 36:43.280
the dream,

36:43.320 --> 36:46.360
it can be our dream,

36:46.400 --> 36:47.880
our reality...

36:48.960 --> 36:51.680
- ..but we'd have to go now!
- Isabella...

36:52.720 --> 36:54.360
..I like you.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.680
I really do.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.880
But I'm afraid, for me,

37:00.920 --> 37:03.120
it'll always be just a dream.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.280
What?

37:06.240 --> 37:11.280
Whether I like it or not, and
believe me, sometimes I hate it...

37:12.840 --> 37:17.000
..but I am Robin Hood, I am an outlaw...

37:18.560 --> 37:22.560
- ..and I can't change that.
- Surely, Robin, surely in time...

37:22.600 --> 37:26.040
we could just start
afresh, become someone new.

37:26.080 --> 37:29.720
- Please...
- No. No. I am who I am.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.040
I tried to have it all once before...

37:33.600 --> 37:36.760
..but it just caused so
much pain for everyone.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.960
No! I'm not her!

37:39.000 --> 37:40.600
I'm truly sorry.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.480
No!

37:45.720 --> 37:46.840
You?

37:49.920 --> 37:51.840
Quick! Go get the guards.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.400
Dead, you said. Taken care of, you said.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.000
- He's always lied, sire.
- Isabella!

37:58.040 --> 38:01.560
In fact, he was going to let me
go and not tell you about it...

38:01.600 --> 38:03.920
- No!
- ..until I knocked him unconscious.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.480
- No, sire.
- You've let the team down, Guy.

38:06.520 --> 38:07.840
You've let yourself down.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.560
- In fact, you're a liability.
- No!

38:09.600 --> 38:11.520
- Gisborne, you're fired!
- No!

38:11.560 --> 38:13.000
You will not fire me.

38:13.040 --> 38:17.440
I've waited all my life to be Sheriff
and I will NOT be fired by you!

38:17.480 --> 38:19.760
How dare you?!

38:19.800 --> 38:22.960
How dare you threaten the monarch?!

38:23.000 --> 38:27.360
You're not a monarch. You're
a pretender, a fake, a fraud!

38:27.400 --> 38:29.880
No, no, not as big a fraud as him.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.200
I've been a fool, sire -

38:32.240 --> 38:35.680
a weak, vain woman
blinded by his flattery.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.800
But now I see the truth,

38:38.840 --> 38:41.320
and I beg you, sire, let me show you

38:41.360 --> 38:43.200
- how sorry I am.
- Isabella, put it...

38:43.240 --> 38:46.280
Save your honeyed words
for someone who cares...

38:46.320 --> 38:49.640
- Hood.
- Be my guest!

39:54.800 --> 39:56.920
Guy...

39:56.960 --> 39:58.760
Goodbye, Isabella.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.280
It's...it's not meant to be like this!

40:11.320 --> 40:15.840
Your days as a free man are
over, Gisborne! They're over!

40:15.880 --> 40:18.200
Argh!

40:20.600 --> 40:21.920
Guards!

40:21.960 --> 40:26.200
Guards! I'm down here with
the Prince! Come and help us!

40:27.560 --> 40:30.800
- You're a dead man walking, Gisborne.
- Never seemed to do you much harm.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.160
Robin!

40:54.920 --> 40:57.200
- This isn't over, Hood.
- You can count on it!

40:57.240 --> 41:00.080
Robin, Robin, leave him.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.040
- We've got to save ourselves.
- This way, come on.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.320
Wait.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.520
Thanks.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.680
Come on, we need to open the hatch.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.560
Come on, come on!

41:22.600 --> 41:23.920
We're here!

41:28.440 --> 41:29.920
I'm sorry...

41:29.960 --> 41:32.360
I'm so sorry.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.240
No!

41:34.280 --> 41:36.040
Please, God, no!

41:39.120 --> 41:40.600
Wait.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.760
Look. There's water.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.920
- Look!
- Thank the Lord!

42:02.440 --> 42:04.200
Thank the Lord?

42:05.360 --> 42:06.840
Thank Robin.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.800
It's full again!

42:13.800 --> 42:16.040
The water's come back!

42:17.200 --> 42:19.480
Jack, that's brilliant!

42:22.440 --> 42:24.480
Here, drink this.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.880
- This is what you do.
- And you do it well!

42:38.520 --> 42:40.680
No. We do it well.

42:53.080 --> 42:54.600
So come on, then.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.800
- What happened with Isabella?
- Isabella...

42:58.840 --> 43:02.880
Well, let's just say Isabella
won't be joining us just yet.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.480
Eh, Kate?

43:31.800 --> 43:35.600
People of Nottingham, the king
is dead. Long live the King!

43:35.640 --> 43:38.280
- Do you love me?
- He's not dead!

43:38.320 --> 43:40.080
I'd know if he was dead, I'd feel it!

43:41.120 --> 43:42.280
Tim.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.120
Wakey-wakey, Archbishop. You've
got a coronation to attend.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.720
And no-one to stop me!

43:48.760 --> 43:50.800
You will make me tipsy.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.760
You will get what you deserve!

43:52.800 --> 43:57.080
For a coronation to take place, you
need a crown. So we steal his crown.
