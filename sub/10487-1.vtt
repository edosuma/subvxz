00:36.302 --> 00:38.566
<i>Hare Krishna.
Hare Krishna.</i>

00:38.638 --> 00:42.438
Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.
Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.945
<i>Just a quarter mile left,
Hare Krishna is still clear.</i>

00:46.012 --> 00:50.449
<i>- Turning for home, Hare Krishna the one to catch.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.111
Hare Krishna!
Come on!

00:53.186 --> 00:56.280
<i>- Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.

Keep it together.

01:02.695 --> 01:05.357
Hare... No!

01:05.432 --> 01:08.890
<i>And a heartbreaking loss for Hare Krishna.!</i>

01:59.352 --> 02:01.912
Give me a 1-5-6,
a 1-5-7 and give me...

02:01.988 --> 02:04.479
Give me a break, will you?
You can't bet every horse in the race.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.752
<i>- It's cheating.
The horses are inside the gate.</i>

02:06.826 --> 02:09.419
- We're gonna get shut out here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09.496 --> 02:13.262
Got a sure winner. Ten dollars
across the board on number two.

02:13.333 --> 02:17.633
At 70 to 1? Charlie!
Where's the money?

02:17.704 --> 02:20.537
If I had the money,
would I be betting long shots?

02:20.607 --> 02:23.804
Please, Edie, cover for me
this one time.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.040
<i>- The flag is up.
- Okay, Charlie. You're down.</i>

02:27.113 --> 02:29.638
<i>- Thank you, sweetheart.
I love you very much.</i>

02:29.716 --> 02:33.015
<i>Away they go.!</i>

02:33.086 --> 02:35.350
<i>Pretty good start for all.</i>

02:35.421 --> 02:39.824

02:39.893 --> 02:44.057
<i>Swinging onto the back stretch, and it's
Last Chance and Coates Tail setting the pace.</i>

02:44.130 --> 02:47.429
<i>Now High Button Shoes
does begin to pick it up.</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:51.334
<i>High Button Shoes nowjoins the pack
as they swing onto the back stretch.</i>

02:51.404 --> 02:54.066
<i>- It's still Punjab and Out of Time the leaders.
- High Button Shoes.</i>

02:54.140 --> 02:56.973
<i>Coates Tail is racing on the outside
curve, and then Last Chance.</i>

02:57.043 --> 02:59.568
<i>High Button Shoes.
High Button Shoes.</i>

02:59.646 --> 03:01.773
<i>High Button Shoes
picks up good ground.</i>

03:01.848 --> 03:04.408
<i>- High Button Shoes coming into contention.
- High Button Shoes!</i>

03:04.484 --> 03:08.352
<i>High Button Shoes.!
High Button Shoes.!</i>

03:08.421 --> 03:10.946
Come on, you schmuck!
Move!

03:11.024 --> 03:13.754
<i>You got it, kid.!
You got it.!</i>

03:13.826 --> 03:17.023
<i>That's the way to do it.!
High Button Shoes.!</i>

03:17.096 --> 03:19.564

03:19.632 --> 03:22.294
<i>- You got it, baby!
- High Button Shoes has won.!</i>

03:22.368 --> 03:26.304
<i>High Button Shoes,
a major upset.</i>

03:26.372 --> 03:28.363
- I love you.
- Love you too.

03:28.441 --> 03:31.001
See you later, sweetheart.

03:31.077 --> 03:34.103
Hi. How you doin'?

03:34.180 --> 03:37.206
Looks like you're having a big day, huh?

03:37.283 --> 03:39.877
Mickey, my favorite bookie.
How's business?

03:39.953 --> 03:43.116
I'll tell you, Charlie.
I'm in a tough racket, you know?

03:43.189 --> 03:46.556
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Well, I gotta see somebo...

03:46.626 --> 03:49.527
Sometimes I get
this terrible feeling...

03:49.596 --> 03:52.622
like people are trying
to avoid me.

03:52.699 --> 03:55.133
Yeah? Gee, that's too bad.

03:55.201 --> 03:59.194
- Maybe you should see someone about that.
- I am seeing someone.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.604
- Who?
- Where's my money, Charlie?

04:01.674 --> 04:03.869
Money? Come on.
I'm broke, Mickey.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.434
You'd be the first to know
when I get money.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.504
Oh, my goodness.
Where did this come from? L...

04:09.582 --> 04:14.281
I tell you what. I'll give you $500,
and we call it even.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.652
I'll tell you what.

04:16.723 --> 04:20.180
I'll take a grand,
and you still owe me three grand.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.824
Three thousand.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.908
Always and forever, kiddo.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.427
Did you come
to borrow money?

05:36.502 --> 05:38.493
Let me just say...

05:48.147 --> 05:51.844
Why do you assume the only reason
I come here is to borrow money?

05:51.918 --> 05:55.012
<i>Because every time you come here,
you borrow money.</i>

05:55.088 --> 05:58.421
Herbie, I'm gonna tell you something
you're not gonna believe.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.756
<i>- I never believe anything that you tell me.
- Ho, ho, ho.</i>

06:01.828 --> 06:05.127
- Very funny.
- No. It's very sad.

06:06.766 --> 06:10.031
<i>Not as sad as a man having dinner
with a photograph.</i>

06:10.103 --> 06:13.630
Hey, come on. I'm celebrating.
It's my 45th wedding anniversary.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.234
Very touching...

06:18.311 --> 06:21.610
except today
isn't your anniversary.

06:21.681 --> 06:24.241
- Look, Suzie was my wife.
- Yes, I realize that.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.309
- I should know my own...
- And she was my sister. I was your best man.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.083
- March 15, 1952.
- Yes. Correct.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.648
Except today is the 16th.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.490
- What? That's impossible.
- Why? That's the way it works.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.497
First you get the 15th,
then right after that is the 16th.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.932
And then later on
comes the 17 th. Here.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.493
Take a look at the date.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.433
Sixteenth...

06:49.509 --> 06:52.672
God, I've blown
my own anniversary.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.149
Sorry, kiddo.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.246
Here.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.883
What the hell?
Hey, if you need clothes...

07:06.959 --> 07:09.553
the Salvation Army's
over on Fourth Street.

07:09.629 --> 07:12.291
- These will be perfect.
- Huh? Perfect for what?

07:12.365 --> 07:14.299
Listen, will you
do me a favor?

07:14.367 --> 07:17.029
I worked in a department store
for half of my life.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.867
If you don't buy something,
you put it back.

07:19.939 --> 07:23.602
Herbie...
happy anniversary.

07:23.676 --> 07:26.076
- That was yesterday.
- Go ahead, open it.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.248
"Mexico and the YucatÃ¡n.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.448
"Witness the spectacle
of a rare solar eclipse...

07:37.523 --> 07:40.356
from the foot of the Mayan pyramids. "
This is a cruise.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.122
That's right.
Deluxe accommodations.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.391
All right,
where'd you get these?

07:45.465 --> 07:49.925
Do you remember a guy named No-Neck?
They finally busted him.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.664
He gave me the tickets
in lieu of the cash he owed me.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.832
<i>Now, wait a minute.
Somebody owed you money?</i>

07:55.908 --> 07:58.775
How dumb
do you think I am?

07:58.845 --> 08:02.747
What are you gonna do? Stay cooped up
in this mausoleum you call home?

08:02.815 --> 08:06.216
- You're still alive. Hasn't anybody told you?
- Look who's talkin'.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.685
You're damn right,
look who's talking!

08:08.754 --> 08:12.212
- Don't you get tired of being alone?
- No. The answer's no.

08:12.291 --> 08:16.455
- Herbie, there's gonna be gourmet food, free drinks,
- No. No.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.463
A bevy of pretty broads.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.295
- Sure, because you're looking for a meaningful relationship.
- Why not?

08:21.367 --> 08:24.302
- You've never had one in your whole life.
- I got news for you.

08:24.370 --> 08:28.136
My whole life isn't over yet, which is
why I suggest we get on that ship...

08:28.207 --> 08:33.167
and sip champagne
with some lonely, rich broads.

08:33.246 --> 08:38.410
Who knows? We may get lucky
during the eclipse.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.419
Charlie, hear me.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.852
The answer is no.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.584
<i>Hold it.! Hold it.!
Coming through.!</i>

08:46.659 --> 08:49.253
Two customers.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.262
Made it just in time, huh?

08:51.330 --> 08:54.026
Herbie, come this way.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.125
- It's the wrong section.
- It looks like our seats.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.136
Yeah, those are
first-class seats.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.434
What's the matter?
We're not first class?

09:00.506 --> 09:02.371
But our boarding things
here say...

09:02.441 --> 09:05.205
I don't care what the boarding things
say. Will you sit down.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.941
- Yeah, but these could belong to somebody else.
- Relax, will ya?

09:09.015 --> 09:10.949
I mean, the doors are closed.

09:11.017 --> 09:14.646
It's not like we're gonna be stopping
on 34th Street to pick up passengers.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.211
- Okay, Charlie.
- Gentlemen?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.281
- Thank you.
- Ah, thank you.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.349
Thank you very much.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.963
- Sir?
- I may become a frequent flyer.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.966
Damn good mimosa.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.968
Here's to good living, kid.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.971
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.906
<i>Okay, now.
Thank you very much.</i>

09:35.975 --> 09:39.411
Okay, now begins the first leg
of our honeymoon.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.412
<i>It's only a year late.</i>

09:41.480 --> 09:45.416
Mmm, I'd like to make a small bet
on where they're gonna be sitting.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.418
<i>There's Mom. Say hi, Mom.</i>

09:47.486 --> 09:49.647
Stop it, will you, Allan?

09:49.722 --> 09:52.748
And my beautiful bride.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.316
Let me see here.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.659
Excuse me.
I believe you're sitting in our seats.

10:02.735 --> 10:05.568
Yeah, that figures.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.607
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. I'm sorry. See what you do?

10:08.674 --> 10:12.542
- May I see your boarding passes, please?
- Actually, it's my fault.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.604
The doctor here thought it would
be best if I were not subjected...

10:15.681 --> 10:18.172
to the stress
of economy class.

10:18.250 --> 10:23.051
<i>37-H and J. You gentlemen
will have to pay for these drinks.</i>

10:23.122 --> 10:25.056
Maybe Blue Cross
could cover it.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.957
That's...

10:28.027 --> 10:31.019
That's very funny, ma'am.
Very witty.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.539
Hey.

10:41.607 --> 10:45.338
Aren't those the seats they use
for transporting convicted felons?

10:45.411 --> 10:47.402
Herbie, sit down.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.778
You're scaring the kids.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes...</i>

11:02.828 --> 11:05.558
<i>we'll begin our nonstop express service
to Miami, Florida.</i>

11:05.631 --> 11:07.895
<i>- Our flight time will be
approximately five hours.</i>

11:16.242 --> 11:19.075
<i>Welcome aboard
the beautiful M.S. Westerdam.</i>

11:19.145 --> 11:23.275
<i>- Your cabin stewards are happy to meet any special needs.
- Ooh.</i>

11:23.349 --> 11:26.580
<i>- So do not hesitate to ask for their assistance.
- Boy, oh, boy.</i>

11:26.652 --> 11:31.089
<i>And please note, there will be a compulsory
lifeboat drill today at 5:30 p. m.</i>

11:31.157 --> 11:33.318
<i>Oh, Mr. Leu.
Back again.</i>

11:33.392 --> 11:35.986
<i>Nice to see you
and the lovely Mrs...</i>

11:36.062 --> 11:39.395
Oh, no. It's someone else,
isn't it? Hello!

11:39.465 --> 11:42.696
<i>I'd like you to meet
my dance hosts... Mac...</i>

11:42.768 --> 11:44.702
<i>- Jonathan.
- Come on!</i>

11:44.770 --> 11:47.568
<i>Please report
to the purser's desk. Mr. Dunbar...</i>

11:47.640 --> 11:51.132
Herbie, listen to me. I wanted
to tell you something before you...

11:51.210 --> 11:53.872
<i>- Herbie...
- Oh, wow.!</i>

11:55.381 --> 11:57.315
I tell you something, Charlie.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.546
When they say "deluxe accommodations,"
they mean deluxe.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.918
Yeah, well, Herbie, "deluxe"
can mean several different things.

12:03.989 --> 12:07.584
For example, in a diner, deluxe means
"comes with french fries. "

12:07.660 --> 12:11.653
<i>- Come on.
- This is it. Oh, Ma!</i>

12:11.731 --> 12:15.963
This is gorgeous!
What a suite. Oh!

12:16.035 --> 12:17.730
<i>- Hi.!
- Hello, ladies.</i>

12:17.803 --> 12:20.772
I want those small pieces in the bedroom.
Who the hell are you?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.774
- Lizzy!
- What, Ma?

12:22.842 --> 12:26.243
Get a load of slouchy here.
What, does he come with the stateroom?

12:26.312 --> 12:28.974
Ma! Where's your hospitality?

12:29.048 --> 12:33.382
Now, listen!
I have been on a plane for three hours.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.250
I have been in a taxi cab
for an hour and a half.

12:36.322 --> 12:40.691
I need to take a crap and a nap,
and I do not need an audience.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.628
- Sounds like a party we can miss.
- We'll see you later, ladies.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.927
Bye now.

12:46.999 --> 12:50.025
<i>Oh, boy. Did you see the chassis
on that broad?</i>

12:50.102 --> 12:52.696
I'll bet she's worth
a few mil.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.139
This must be wrong. I mean,
why would they have us way down here?

12:56.208 --> 13:00.542
I like it down here. Gives us a chance
to get away from the commotion up top.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.446
What, like the other
passengers and the view? This is us.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.349
Listen to me. I've been meaning
to tell you something.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.945
Before you go into the room,
Herbie, please listen to me.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.597
- Cozy, isn't it?
- It's what? Cozy?

13:22.668 --> 13:26.069
A good fart will
give you a concussion.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.629
Needs a little daylight.

13:42.454 --> 13:46.720
Herb, this is the best possible thing
that could've happened.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.886
Gee, I can't wait
to hear why.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.294
- As dance hosts, it's actually our job...
- What?

13:52.364 --> 13:55.492
- To flirt with all the classy broads.
- Our job? Dance hosts?

13:55.568 --> 13:58.435
Yeah, that's how I was able
to afford the tickets.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.099
Instead of paying for the cruise,
I signed us up as dance hosts.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.166
- So the cruise is free.
- What do you mean it's free, you idiot?

14:05.244 --> 14:09.010
- We're workin' here!
- We're not workin'. We're dancing and cavorting.

14:09.081 --> 14:11.675
Oh, you moron. You don't even
know how to dance.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.082
Well, that's why
I brought you here.

14:16.255 --> 14:19.554
Oh. Perhaps we're interrupting
you gentlemen at a bad time.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.958
Welcome aboard.
We're gonna be sharing the bathroom.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.361
This is Jonathan Deveraux.
I'm Mac Vela, U.S.M.C., retired.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.128
- I'll be your liaison to the C.D.
- The what "D"?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.192
Cruise director.
Gil Godwyn.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.831
<i>Oh, it's too bad you got Gil
for your first gig.</i>

14:34.907 --> 14:37.137
- He's a real prick.
- Control freak.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.200
- Friggin' Nazi.
- Classic megalomaniac.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.439
Not a nice man.

14:41.513 --> 14:44.414
Well, if you have
any questions, feel free.

14:44.483 --> 14:48.977
I got one question.
What's the fastest route off this ship?

14:53.425 --> 14:55.416
Excuse me.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.611
- Hiya.
- Hello.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.716
- Okay, Chief. Let's pull the gangway in.
- Take in the gangway, Captain.

15:29.795 --> 15:33.026
<i>All visitors should
now be ashore. Last call, please.</i>

15:33.098 --> 15:36.158
<i>All visitors
should now be ashore.</i>

15:36.235 --> 15:38.203
Pardon me!

15:38.270 --> 15:40.101
Ohh!

15:42.174 --> 15:45.109
Oh, my God.
Sir, are you okay?

15:45.177 --> 15:47.668
<i>- Yeah, I think.
- There you go. You sure?</i>

15:47.746 --> 15:49.941
Thank you. Yeah.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.347
- God, that's embarrassing.
- Only for you.

15:54.419 --> 15:56.444
- Oh, my God!
- What?

15:56.522 --> 15:58.717
<i>The ship's moving.</i>

15:58.790 --> 16:01.918
- Ships are known to do that.
- Wait a minute! I need that gangplank!

16:01.994 --> 16:05.760
<i>Please.! Hello.! Somebody.!
I gotta use that sucker.!</i>

16:05.831 --> 16:08.061
<i>L... I've gotta...
Hello.!</i>

16:08.133 --> 16:10.761
Where the hell did they go with my luggage?

16:10.836 --> 16:15.136
Oh, God Almighty. Thank you very much.
What's the matter with you?

16:15.207 --> 16:18.005
- You got a problem?
- Not really.

16:18.076 --> 16:22.479
L- I always cry at sailings.
They're so romantic.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.483
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.485
Mm-hmm.

16:42.734 --> 16:45.498
<i>Pleasejoin
your cruise staffby the Lido Pool...</i>

16:45.571 --> 16:49.905
<i>on the upper promenade deck aft
for the gala sail-away fiesta.</i>

16:49.975 --> 16:52.967
<i>Meet your cruise director and enjoy
the music and drinks and prizes.</i>

16:53.045 --> 16:55.309
Herbie.

16:55.380 --> 16:58.645
Herbie, I know you're upset now,
but in a few days...

16:58.717 --> 17:00.651
<i>you'll be thanking me.</i>

17:00.719 --> 17:03.813
Listen, Charlie.
What is in this for you?

17:03.889 --> 17:08.189
Now, tell me, and no shit
because I'm too tired.

17:08.260 --> 17:12.856
Okay, fine. You remember my old pal
Tony? Tony.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.865
- Anthony Caldoni?
- Yeah.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.867
The mail fraud guy.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.563
First of all,
those charges were dropped.

17:19.637 --> 17:22.128
But more importantly,
guess what he's doing today?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.141
I don't give a rat's ass.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.576
He's married to one
of the richest broads in Palm Beach.

17:27.646 --> 17:31.377
And guess how they met?
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.941
- One, two...
- No way, Jose.

17:34.019 --> 17:37.386
Just wake me up at the first port of call.
That's where I'm gettin' off.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.118
- I hate to see you do this, Herbie.
- Why is that, Charles?

17:40.192 --> 17:43.457
Because if you don't dance,
you lose your employee status...

17:43.528 --> 17:47.225
and that means you gotta pay for the
whole cruise... that's 2,500 smackaroonies.

17:47.299 --> 17:51.235
You son of a bitch! You're the one
who should be paying.

17:51.303 --> 17:54.500
<i>Will the dance hosts
please report to the main ballroom.</i>

17:54.573 --> 17:57.633
<i>Herbie, they're playing our song.</i>

18:23.969 --> 18:27.132
<i>Ahem.!</i>

18:27.205 --> 18:29.139
Very nice hair.

18:29.207 --> 18:32.836
Right.
Nails. Cut 'em. Uh!

18:32.911 --> 18:35.209
<i>Let me. Thank you.</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:39.444
Excellent, Mac.
Jonathan, clip the ear hair.

18:39.518 --> 18:43.010
- I beg your pardon?
- Ear hair!

18:45.557 --> 18:48.822
I'm very skeptical of dance hosts
who can't keep time.

18:48.894 --> 18:52.261
- Mister...
- Me? Sullivan, Herb.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.323
- Uh, and that's Gordon, Charles.
- Lovely.

18:55.400 --> 19:00.064
Sorry we were late, but,
uh, it's a very big boat.

19:00.138 --> 19:04.074
<i>This boat... happens to be
the flagship vessel...</i>

19:04.142 --> 19:08.135
of the world's premiere cruise line,
and I am the cruise director.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.238
Sir, yes, sir!

19:10.315 --> 19:12.783
I've a feeling you two
are going to be trouble.

19:12.851 --> 19:16.582
- Oh...
- No. We're pussycats.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.748
For your sake,
I hope...

19:22.694 --> 19:25.686
Is that cologne
or Armor All?

19:25.764 --> 19:29.632
That's close, close. It's cologne,
but I bought it at a gas station.

19:29.701 --> 19:32.431
I've got my eye on you.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.734
You're not so bad yourself.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.901
<i>All right.</i>

19:38.977 --> 19:41.571
Gentlemen, we're
30 seconds from intros.

19:41.646 --> 19:45.412
Now, remember that you
are the representatives of this ship...

19:45.484 --> 19:49.580
and will, at all times, behave
in a manner appropriate thereto.

19:49.654 --> 19:54.421
<i>You will be courteous
and respectful at all times.</i>

19:54.493 --> 19:59.021
When the music stops, you will
escort your partner back to her seat.

19:59.097 --> 20:03.329
<i>And above all, you will not
fraternize privately...</i>

20:03.402 --> 20:05.393
with the guests
at any time.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.462
- Uh, no.
- If you do, it's grounds for immediate dismissal.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.440
Permission to speak, sir.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.307
Denied. Mac, mike.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.708
- Who's Mac Mike?
- I don't know.

20:25.190 --> 20:28.316
<i>Ohh, yes!</i>

20:28.393 --> 20:32.727
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the M. S. Westerdam proudly presents...</i>

20:32.798 --> 20:34.857
<i>your cruise director...</i>

20:34.933 --> 20:36.867
the very talented...

20:36.935 --> 20:40.336
Mr. Gil Godwyn!

20:40.405 --> 20:42.339
Thank you!

20:42.407 --> 20:45.501
Can't believe it. The man
actually opens for himself.

20:45.577 --> 20:50.480
Thank you so very much.
Aren't they absolutely marvelous?

20:50.549 --> 20:52.244
Thank you. Thank you.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.512
- Very good. Very good.
- Thank you.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.577
- Very good. Very good.
- Magnificent.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.850
Moving experience.

21:29.321 --> 21:31.721
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

21:31.790 --> 21:34.782
You're too kind, really.
Thank you, girls.

21:34.860 --> 21:38.853
What could his parents
have possibly done to him?

21:38.930 --> 21:42.991
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce our dance hosts.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.127
Here they are... Mac,

21:45.203 --> 21:49.105
<i>Jonathan, Phil...</i>

21:49.174 --> 21:52.075
- How do you like him?
- Oh, he's too short.

21:52.143 --> 21:54.634
Julio...

21:54.713 --> 21:57.614
<i>- Bobby, Scott,
- Me! Me!</i>

21:57.682 --> 22:00.412
<i>Herb and Ch... Ch...</i>

22:00.485 --> 22:02.419
Ch... Charlie!
Charlie!

22:02.487 --> 22:04.478
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

22:06.791 --> 22:08.918
Charlie.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.485
- That guy Herb is cute, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

22:27.746 --> 22:31.238
Well, let's get 'em while they're hot.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.250
Just an expression.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.616
Let's go.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.454
It's just like
the beach at Normandy.

22:46.531 --> 22:49.864
Gentlemen, I didn't hire you
to be wallflowers.

22:49.935 --> 22:53.132
I don't want anyone on my ship
ever to feel ignored.

22:53.204 --> 22:56.196
Mrs. Carruthers, may I
have the great pleasure?

22:56.274 --> 22:59.175
Ah. Oh.

22:59.244 --> 23:01.109
Kiss-ass.

23:09.988 --> 23:11.979
Take it, fellas!

23:12.057 --> 23:15.288
- I'm Mac. Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Mac.

23:19.864 --> 23:22.526
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Where do you think you're going?

23:22.601 --> 23:27.038
Oh, taking on a lot of water
in the forward compartment, sir.

23:27.105 --> 23:29.835
Oh, God.
You have two minutes.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.672
Go.

23:37.582 --> 23:40.915
- Any time you're ready, Herb.
- Huh?

23:40.986 --> 23:45.582
Silly old me. I do expect my dance hosts
to actually dance.

23:45.657 --> 23:49.525
Well, of course, yeah. It's just that
I don't know if I'm up to...

23:49.594 --> 23:51.528
I'll tell you the truth, Gil.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.588
- I lost my wife not too long ago.
- Oh, good. Good.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.600
Tell it to the ladies.
They eat it up.

23:56.668 --> 23:59.796
Um, do I take a number
or, uh...

23:59.871 --> 24:02.704
may I serve myself?

24:02.774 --> 24:05.265
Yeah. Well, I'm
kind of new at this.

24:05.343 --> 24:08.176
Well, you can dance,
can't you?

24:12.283 --> 24:14.581
Ohh!

24:14.653 --> 24:17.019
Oh, you can dance.

24:30.368 --> 24:33.064
<i>Ohh!</i>

24:33.138 --> 24:36.403
Oh, I sure hope
these pins hold.

24:36.474 --> 24:39.409
- What pins?
- Oh, nothing serious.

24:39.477 --> 24:43.004
They just keep my legs
attached to my hips.

24:43.081 --> 24:45.072
Da-da

25:39.738 --> 25:43.469
- Have you ever seen so much food in your life?
- Spectacular!

25:43.541 --> 25:46.169
I was a size four
when I got on this ship.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.940
Excuse me for butting in, but don't I
know you from someplace?

25:49.013 --> 25:51.140
- W-Well, I don't know...
- Pardon me.

25:51.216 --> 25:55.409
Uh...

26:36.895 --> 26:39.591
That's a good smoke.

26:43.735 --> 26:45.999
Sometimes.

26:48.406 --> 26:51.603
<i>Whoo-hoo.!</i>

26:51.676 --> 26:54.873
- I like it.
- Bravo.

26:57.682 --> 27:00.708
Oh, thank you very much.
Is there a seat open there?

27:00.785 --> 27:02.719
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Well, sure.

27:02.787 --> 27:06.223
- Pull up a chair.
- Here we go.

27:06.291 --> 27:10.125
- Looks like it's your lucky night, kid.
- It is that. It is.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.686
Luck had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

27:12.764 --> 27:15.927
She played that hand splendidly.
Absolutely splendidly.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.061
- Why, thank you.
- That's okay. You can drop the accent now.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.936
You want a refill
on this, kid?

27:23.007 --> 27:25.134
<i>- Your glass was empty.
- Oh, thanks.</i>

27:25.210 --> 27:28.111
Name's Charlie Gordon.
I'm single and I'm lookin'.

27:28.179 --> 27:31.808
Liz LaBreche. I'm single and I ain't
lookin', but thanks for the drink.

27:31.883 --> 27:34.317
- Cheers.
- You're welcome.

27:34.385 --> 27:38.287
- They call me Gordo on the street.
- What street is that, Gordo?

27:38.356 --> 27:40.586
Wall Street.
You ever hear of it?

27:40.658 --> 27:43.491
What exactly do you do
on Wall Street?

27:43.561 --> 27:46.052
Well, I have a small
hot dog stand.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.189
When things go badly
over there...

27:48.266 --> 27:50.962
I'm in the mergers
and acquisitions game.

27:51.035 --> 27:52.969
The buy-in's $1,000.

27:53.037 --> 27:56.939
A thousand dollars. That reminds me
of my first year of college.

27:57.008 --> 28:00.171
Where exactly did you
go to college, Gordo?

28:00.245 --> 28:02.736
Oh, that's a little place
called F.U.

28:04.382 --> 28:07.249
- Your name, sir, is...
- Carswell.

28:07.318 --> 28:09.912
Now, boys, boys, boys.
Let's not have a pissin' match here.

28:09.988 --> 28:11.922
We're here to play cards.
Let's play.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.356
Yes, we're here
to play poker...

28:14.425 --> 28:18.657
if you can raise
the thousand dollars.

28:18.730 --> 28:22.530
Oh, a thousand dollars. May I have
that deck for a minute, please?

28:22.600 --> 28:25.262
<i>I'll give it right back to you.
I just want to take a look.</i>

28:25.336 --> 28:28.772
I'll bet you $5,000
even money...

28:28.840 --> 28:30.774
top card's a picture.

28:30.842 --> 28:33.140
- Even money?
- Yes, sir.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.873
<i>- You've got yourself a bet.
- Okay.</i>

28:35.947 --> 28:37.938
Turn it over.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.013
You owe me $5,000.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.319
That was a lot of fun.

28:46.391 --> 28:51.226
<i>I'll tell you what...
let's go again for 10, huh?</i>

28:51.296 --> 28:53.992
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.159
<i>If you want to quit right now, it's okay
with me. I'll give you the five grand.</i>

28:57.235 --> 28:59.294
Let's make it 20.

28:59.370 --> 29:03.033
Yes. Yes. I like that.
Now we're having some fun.

29:03.107 --> 29:05.735
Twenty?

29:05.810 --> 29:09.940
<i>You want to bet $20,000
the top card is not a picture?</i>

29:10.014 --> 29:12.141
You've got a deal.

29:12.216 --> 29:16.550
Okay, boy.
$20,000. Turn it over.

29:18.122 --> 29:21.558
<i>Turn it over, please.</i>

29:26.798 --> 29:28.766
Whew.

29:30.768 --> 29:33.362
That's very interesting.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.168
Oh, boy, is that interesting.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.174
You want to
double it again?

29:39.344 --> 29:42.074
Yes.

29:42.146 --> 29:46.105
Enough of this child's play.
I owe you $15,000.

29:46.184 --> 29:48.118
- All right.
- Let's play poker.

29:48.186 --> 29:50.746
Okay. Here we go.

29:50.822 --> 29:53.256
<i>That's a lot of fun.</i>

29:55.526 --> 29:58.984
- I'm gonna get a brownie.
- A brownie? Yeah.

30:00.832 --> 30:04.233
- L...
- Oh. Sorry.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.465
<i>We shall have to call the Guinness Book
of Records about your friend Charlie.</i>

30:07.538 --> 30:09.472
Now what?

30:09.540 --> 30:13.670
- He's taking the longest piss in recorded freaking history.
- Oh.

30:13.745 --> 30:17.943
There's a lady at table 16 who's arrived
late. I suggest you welcome her.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.109
Okay. Where's table 16?

30:20.184 --> 30:22.118
Over there.

30:22.186 --> 30:24.468
Oh, what a lovely room.

30:25.770 --> 30:29.831
- Oh, that, uh... that... lady.
- Mm-hmm.

30:36.681 --> 30:38.774
Hi there. Excuse me.

30:38.849 --> 30:41.010
- Hello.
- Nice to see you're still on board.

30:41.085 --> 30:44.077
Thank you. I just wondered
if you'd care to dance.

30:44.155 --> 30:48.922
Actually, I've seen you move. How do I
know you won't trip and drag me overboard?

30:48.993 --> 30:51.553
Well, you don't.

30:51.629 --> 30:54.564
<i>But I swim even better
than I dance.</i>

30:54.632 --> 30:57.192
- Go for it, Mom.
- I promise I won't bite.

31:00.004 --> 31:02.666
Here goes nothing.

31:11.482 --> 31:14.474
I haven't danced
in a long time.

31:14.552 --> 31:22.885
Slow, slow,
quick-quick.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.123
Don't look down.
Look at me. That's it.

31:26.197 --> 31:29.530
Honey, tell me I did the right thing
by bringing Mom along.

31:29.600 --> 31:33.036
You did the right thing.

31:33.104 --> 31:37.438
Mmm. Now let's go sneak inside
one of those lifeboats.

31:39.977 --> 31:42.969
You and whoever
you used to dance with...

31:43.047 --> 31:45.106
you must have been
great together.

31:45.182 --> 31:48.015
Now promenade.
Yeah, that would be Suzie and me.

31:48.085 --> 31:50.212
We danced all night long
at our wedding...

31:50.287 --> 31:53.279
and it seems like we never
stopped dancing for 46 years.

31:53.357 --> 31:56.690
- What a lovely image.
- Oh, thank you.

31:56.761 --> 31:59.252
Now tell me all about you.
Everything.

31:59.330 --> 32:01.321
- Everything?
- Sure.

32:01.399 --> 32:05.699
<i>- It's only a 10-day cruise. - Well,
give me the Reader's Digest version.</i>

32:07.338 --> 32:09.306
Okay.

32:09.373 --> 32:11.341
- I live in New York.
- Yeah.

32:11.409 --> 32:14.970
- I was a book editor at Doubleday.
- Ooh.

32:15.045 --> 32:17.570
- Mother of two.
- Mm-hmm.

32:17.648 --> 32:20.139
Recent widow of one.

32:20.217 --> 32:24.745
And I was... I was shanghaied here
by... by newlyweds.

32:24.822 --> 32:26.756
- Oh.
- Mmm.

32:26.824 --> 32:29.952
- The bride is my daughter.
- Oh, well, I'm sure that she meant well.

32:30.027 --> 32:32.860
- I'm sure.
- Are you having any fun?

32:32.930 --> 32:37.424
- I don't know yet.
- Well, whad'ya know.

33:00.791 --> 33:02.656
Thank you.

33:02.726 --> 33:05.456
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:07.898 --> 33:11.129
That was, uh, fun.

33:11.202 --> 33:13.670
- Yeah.
- Doctor...

33:13.737 --> 33:17.173
- Oh, uh, Sullivan. Call me Herb.
- Vivian.

33:17.241 --> 33:21.075
<i>I could use a little fresh air.</i>

33:21.145 --> 33:23.670
- Join me?
- Ye... Oh.

33:23.747 --> 33:25.874
- Well, I'd love to.
- I promise I won't bite.

33:25.950 --> 33:30.410
You know something? I'm gonna go along
with you in case you change your mind.

33:30.488 --> 33:33.855
<i>Are you getting
enough zeroes in there?</i>

33:40.498 --> 33:43.331
- Eighteen thousand.
- Thank you.

33:45.436 --> 33:49.065
Enjoying the company
of a stunning lady...

33:49.139 --> 33:53.075
is all I wish to take away
from this table, sir.

33:53.143 --> 33:56.044
<i>Mere confetti.</i>

33:56.113 --> 33:59.776
<i>Confetti, sir.</i>

33:59.850 --> 34:03.718
- Excuse me.
- Very, very nice.

34:06.457 --> 34:10.291
I once heard that if a whale
loses its mate...

34:10.360 --> 34:12.851
it never takes another.

34:12.929 --> 34:16.730
Do you suppose that could really happen?

34:16.800 --> 34:20.031
I haven't spoken
to a lot of whales lately, but...

34:20.103 --> 34:23.665
hell, if it was perfect
the first time, then...

34:23.741 --> 34:27.040
My feelings...
My feelings exactly.

34:27.110 --> 34:29.476
<i>Ooh.</i>

34:29.547 --> 34:31.879
<i>Better not fall
on our heads.</i>

34:31.949 --> 34:35.248
What, this? Oh, no, that's
50-gauge cable.

34:35.319 --> 34:39.016
Hell, that could hold a couple
of elephants playing patty-cake.

34:39.089 --> 34:41.922
Either you know your elephants
or you know your cable.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.358
I was a swabbie.
Pacific area.

34:44.428 --> 34:46.487
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:46.563 --> 34:50.125
- Did you ever have to get in one of those?
- No, ma'am.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.134
Thank God.

34:52.202 --> 34:55.069
Matowski did though.

34:55.139 --> 34:59.473
- Who?
- Ensign Myron Matowski.

34:59.543 --> 35:03.377
He was nuts about this Filipino girl,
and her parents objected...

35:03.447 --> 35:06.314
so one night they put her in a boat
to send her to another island.

35:06.383 --> 35:10.547
Matowski hijacks one of these lifeboats,
gets in there...

35:10.621 --> 35:13.112
whoosh... out he goes,
sends up a flare.

35:13.190 --> 35:15.454
He damn near started
a naval battle.

35:15.526 --> 35:17.517
- Did she see the flare?
- Are you kidding?

35:17.595 --> 35:21.053
The last I heard, they were workin' on
their sixth grandchild...

35:21.131 --> 35:24.589
and she had her own brand of applesauce.

35:29.273 --> 35:31.400
So... So tell me...

35:31.475 --> 35:34.273
how does a swabbie
become a doctor?

35:34.345 --> 35:37.246
A what?
Yeah.

35:37.314 --> 35:40.010
L- I wanted to explain
that to you.

35:40.084 --> 35:42.882
- You don't have to explain.
- Yes... No, I wanted to... explain it.

35:42.953 --> 35:46.389
- That's...
- Well, would you like to walk me to my cabin?

35:46.457 --> 35:50.553
Yeah, I would,
but I-I-I ca-ca-can't.

35:50.628 --> 35:52.562
I can take a hint.

35:52.630 --> 35:54.564
No. What hint?

35:54.632 --> 35:57.795
I promised a couple of chest butchers
that I'd have a brandy with them.

35:57.868 --> 35:59.859
Right.

36:05.175 --> 36:07.166
Chest butchers?

36:08.312 --> 36:10.712
What the hell kind
of a moron are you?

36:12.716 --> 36:16.709
Now, why would you go
and do something like that?

36:16.787 --> 36:19.551
- To impress you.
- Oh!

36:19.623 --> 36:23.218
Oh. Well, keep it up.

36:23.293 --> 36:25.352
It just might work.

36:30.668 --> 36:33.728
<i>Mr. Gordon.!</i>

36:35.806 --> 36:40.175
What you do, like samurai.
Great style.

36:52.823 --> 36:56.384
You have
most terrible accent.

36:56.460 --> 36:59.554
- Where you learn Japanese?
- Okinawa.

36:59.630 --> 37:04.897
- Oh.
- It's a small sushi joint on the Sunset Strip.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.370
<i>Where were you?</i>

37:12.443 --> 37:15.071
A passenger requested
an escort, sir.

37:15.145 --> 37:18.080
- Fraternizing.
- Nobody "fratted" anybody.

37:18.148 --> 37:20.378
- All we did was... Oh, my God.
- Don't tell me that.

37:20.451 --> 37:24.046
<i>Coming through, please.
Injured man here. Injury.</i>

37:26.690 --> 37:29.750
Well, if it isn't the Phantom
of the Ballroom.

37:29.827 --> 37:32.387
I oughta sue you guys.

37:32.463 --> 37:35.330
Everything around here
is so slippery and wet.

37:35.399 --> 37:38.960
- It's an ocean liner.
- I may never dance again.

37:39.036 --> 37:41.596
Aga... I haven't
seen you dance yet.

37:41.672 --> 37:44.937
Fortunately for you,
I found the infirmary.

37:45.008 --> 37:48.409
The infirmary is closed
at this hour.

37:48.479 --> 37:52.745
- That's what I found out.
- Look, let...

37:52.816 --> 37:57.810
Let me... Let me speak
candidly, gentlemen.

37:57.888 --> 38:00.686
I am this close
to a promotion...

38:00.758 --> 38:03.750
that would make me
vice president of entertainment.

38:03.827 --> 38:05.920
Wow.

38:05.996 --> 38:08.362
I intend to get that job...

38:08.432 --> 38:12.562
by showing how well I can keep
two old dickheads like you in line.

38:12.636 --> 38:14.695
- Oh, now, listen, you...
- No, you listen.

38:14.772 --> 38:18.469
Don't mess with me.
I'm your worst nightmare.

38:18.542 --> 38:22.501
A song-and-dance man
raised on a military base.

38:22.579 --> 38:24.570
Dismissed.

38:25.849 --> 38:27.942
<i>Hoo.!</i>

38:34.825 --> 38:38.522
Now, you seem to be
annoyed with me, Herbie.

38:38.595 --> 38:41.860
Tell me if I'm wrong.

38:41.932 --> 38:45.459
And what's this about you
leaving the dance floor?

38:45.536 --> 38:47.470
None of your business.

38:47.538 --> 38:51.941
None of my business.
How do you like that?

38:52.009 --> 38:56.343
- Why are you sterilizing your trousers?
- I'm steaming them.

38:56.413 --> 38:59.246
Oh. Then what are you gonna do,
eat 'em with garlic butter?

38:59.316 --> 39:01.841
It takes the wrinkles out,
you imbecile!

39:01.919 --> 39:05.514
Huh. A man who's steaming
his pants at midnight.

39:05.589 --> 39:09.582
- That generally means there's a broad.
- No broad.

39:09.660 --> 39:12.424
Well, that's too bad,
because I got one lined up.

39:12.496 --> 39:14.430
Rich. Texas rich.

39:14.498 --> 39:16.830
With an ass so beautiful...

39:16.900 --> 39:19.562
it's a shame she
has to sit down on it.

39:19.636 --> 39:22.400
Will you do me a favor and
just knock that stuff off?

39:22.472 --> 39:25.202
I'm sorry.
I forgot you were cooking.

39:25.275 --> 39:28.108
Now that you've got this girl, how long
is it gonna be before she finds out...

39:28.178 --> 39:30.112
you're not the man
she thought you were?

39:30.180 --> 39:33.377
- By then, she'll be in love.
- In love with a lie.

39:33.450 --> 39:35.714
Nobody's perfect.

39:35.786 --> 39:40.723
I think a man should always tell a woman
the truth before she falls in love.

39:40.791 --> 39:42.725
<i>Otherwise, how do you
know it's real?</i>

39:42.793 --> 39:46.251
What's real is, if I play my cards right,
I'll wind up on easy street.

39:46.330 --> 39:49.390
Once I'm there,
I'm inviting you over every Sunday.

39:49.466 --> 39:53.095
- I don't want to have anything to do with this.
- Okay, then don't come over.

39:53.170 --> 39:56.662
She thinks I'm a doctor.

39:56.740 --> 39:59.300
- Who?
- Oh, nobody.

40:07.651 --> 40:10.484
You met a broad.
Da-da

40:20.330 --> 40:24.289
Y- You're crazy. Years of insanity
have made you crazy.

40:24.368 --> 40:28.168
- Do I look crippled or not?
- Yeah, crippled up here.

40:28.238 --> 40:33.437
Oh, cut it out!

40:33.510 --> 40:37.002
Most of you will work the dance class
from 10:00 to 11:00...

40:37.080 --> 40:40.243
and the wine and cheese
tasting from 12:00 to 1:00.

40:40.317 --> 40:42.342
Please use moderation.

40:42.419 --> 40:46.321
The last thing I need is flatulating
dance hosts staggering about the ship.

40:46.390 --> 40:49.848
<i>I bet his father was cruise director
on the Bismarck.</i>

40:49.927 --> 40:52.088
Think of yourselves...

40:52.162 --> 40:54.494
as butterflies, gentlemen...

40:54.564 --> 40:57.590
and our guests as flowers.

40:57.668 --> 41:02.002
Your job is to pollinate the flowers
with hospitality.

41:02.072 --> 41:05.166
This guy's been at sea
too long.

41:05.242 --> 41:08.370
And if you screw up,
I am personally going to see to it...

41:08.445 --> 41:12.814
that you are removed from the ship and
charged the full round-trip passage...

41:12.883 --> 41:18.651
<i>of $5,462.51 as indicated
in your contracts.</i>

41:18.722 --> 41:21.190
What the hell is...
Five thou... Five thousand?

41:21.258 --> 41:23.488
You told me 2,000!

41:23.560 --> 41:28.623
<i>As for you, Mr. Gordon, Dr. Johanson
will see you at 1100 hours sharp.</i>

41:28.699 --> 41:33.159
I don't think that's necessary, sir.
The foot just needs rest.

41:33.236 --> 41:37.332
You will remain off
your... injured foot...

41:37.407 --> 41:40.069
until Dr. Johanson says otherwise.
Are we clear?

41:40.143 --> 41:42.668
Yes, sir. Clear!
Extremely clear, sir.

41:42.746 --> 41:45.715
Brilliant.
Dismissed.

41:52.589 --> 41:55.581
<i>All passengers
disembarking at Playa del Carmen...</i>

41:55.659 --> 41:57.718
<i>please report
to tender deck, midship.</i>

42:01.898 --> 42:06.494
<i>Those of you attending the festival
must board the fiesta bus at 4:10.</i>

42:06.570 --> 42:08.765
<i>Remember, the last tender...</i>

42:08.839 --> 42:11.637
<i>will return from shore
at 4:30.</i>

42:19.916 --> 42:24.182
Well... look who's here.

42:24.254 --> 42:27.883
Flowers and all.
I'll bet they're for me.

42:27.958 --> 42:32.691
- Who else would they be for?
- Save it... Hoss.

42:34.097 --> 42:36.429
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

42:36.500 --> 42:39.367
Thank you very much.
Sure appreciate it.

42:39.436 --> 42:43.566
You know, the first day you was in here,
sniffing around like a yard dog?

42:43.640 --> 42:45.938
I knew you'd be back.

42:46.009 --> 42:48.000
<i>Ma, for the love of Pete.!</i>

42:48.078 --> 42:51.104
- Who's Pete? My competition?
- That's right.

42:51.181 --> 42:53.274
And guess who I'm rootin' for?

42:53.350 --> 42:56.911
- Oh, Charlie!
- Hi.

42:56.987 --> 43:00.946
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
- Oh, yeah.

43:01.024 --> 43:02.958
Are these for me?

43:03.026 --> 43:05.722
- No.
- No?

43:05.796 --> 43:08.458
- Oh, yes!
- Ohh.

43:08.532 --> 43:10.466
They're just beautiful.

43:10.534 --> 43:12.468
I didn't want to be
too showy.

43:12.536 --> 43:16.563
Oh, well, yours are very tasteful.
Thank you, Charlie.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.972
<i>- Thank you.
- I have to get dressed.</i>

43:19.042 --> 43:22.034
Why don't you talk to Ma?
Ma'll keep you company. Excuse me.

43:22.112 --> 43:26.105
- Okay.
- I want you to behave yourself, Charlie.

43:26.183 --> 43:30.279
You see, I saw the way you were starin'
at my daughter's... chest.

43:30.353 --> 43:33.516
- Oh, I used to be a cardiologist.
- Really?

43:33.590 --> 43:36.115
So I'm almost ready.

43:36.193 --> 43:38.491
Charlie, would you like
to walk with me?

43:38.562 --> 43:41.554
- I'd be delighted.
- Oh, thank you.

43:43.066 --> 43:45.933
- Ma, we'll see you later.
- Have fun.

43:46.002 --> 43:49.403
I'll try to find a shot glass
for those flowers.

43:49.473 --> 43:53.375
- She's darling, isn't she?
- That's Ma.

43:53.443 --> 43:55.377
<i>- Oh, there you are.
- Hello.</i>

43:55.445 --> 43:58.278
We really must hurry.
The bus is leaving in 10 minutes.

43:58.348 --> 44:00.282
- Hello there, sport.
- Hello.

44:00.350 --> 44:04.719
- Why don't you come with us?
- I've been told that the tour is full.

44:07.057 --> 44:09.719
Oh, about those flowers...
thank you so much.

44:09.793 --> 44:11.886
They're beautiful. I love them.
See you later?

44:11.962 --> 44:13.953
- Have a good day, Gordo.
- Ta-ta.

44:14.030 --> 44:16.692
There's something about that man
I really don't like.

44:16.766 --> 44:20.550
<i>- Don't you agree?
- That you don't like him? I'd agree with that.</i>

44:27.223 --> 44:29.885
Ha-ha!

44:32.662 --> 44:36.792
They call this dancing?
I did this in line at the A&P.

44:36.866 --> 44:39.300
Well, the view is right.

44:39.369 --> 44:43.305
- I used to have an ass like that.
- Guys, pay attention.

44:44.741 --> 44:47.073
Would you mind
standing back, please?

44:47.143 --> 44:50.169
<i>Let me show you how this is done, okay?</i>

45:06.329 --> 45:09.628
<i>Ship-to-shore call
for Mr. Cullen Carswell.</i>

45:09.699 --> 45:12.293
That's you!
That sounds excitin'.

45:12.368 --> 45:14.529
I'm sorry, Liz. I'll try
to wrap it up quickly.

45:14.604 --> 45:17.630
- Why don't I just go ahead and I'll save you a seat?
- All right.

45:17.707 --> 45:19.971
- Ship-to-shore for Carswell.
- Oh, yes, sir.

45:20.043 --> 45:22.807
It's an overseas call
from Mr. Donald Trump.

45:22.879 --> 45:24.870
He's calling from Zurich.
Says it's urgent.

45:24.948 --> 45:26.939
Is there a telephone handy
with some privacy?

45:27.016 --> 45:29.314
You can take it in the second booth
there on your right.

45:29.385 --> 45:31.376
Thank you.

45:37.360 --> 45:40.295
Hello. This is Cullen Carswell.
I'll take my call now.

45:40.363 --> 45:42.957
- One moment, sir.
- Hello.

45:43.032 --> 45:47.366
Hello, Mr. Carswell. Hello.
- Who is this?

45:47.437 --> 45:50.895
<i>This is the international
operator.</i>

45:50.974 --> 45:54.341
I have momentarily
lost your congestion.

45:54.410 --> 45:57.004
Please hold
for Mr. Trump.

45:57.080 --> 46:00.413
Yes, I'll hold,
but please hurry.

46:00.483 --> 46:03.748
- Are you holding, sir?
- Yes, yes, I'm holding.

46:04.921 --> 46:07.389
Is this Mr. Car-smell?

46:07.457 --> 46:09.391
Carswell!
Yes.

46:09.459 --> 46:13.020
Please hold.
Don't go away.

46:40.223 --> 46:42.953
<i>All passengers
traveling to the festival...</i>

46:43.026 --> 46:46.962
<i>must board the fiesta bus at wharf 10
for immediate departure.</i>

46:47.030 --> 46:48.998
<i>- This is the last call.
- Hey!</i>

46:49.065 --> 46:52.899
I figured I'd see if there were
any no-shows. Where's your friend?

46:55.071 --> 46:57.767
You just don't give up,
do you?

47:02.645 --> 47:04.613
Mmm.

47:04.681 --> 47:07.445
<i>Oh, look at those.!</i>

47:07.517 --> 47:10.975
- Don't you just love horses, Charlie?
- Only when they win.

47:13.323 --> 47:16.087
- You've never done any real gambling, have you?
- For how much?

47:16.159 --> 47:20.960
<i>I'm not talking about money.
I'm talking about life gambling.</i>

47:21.030 --> 47:23.021
You've never been married,
have you?

47:23.099 --> 47:27.365
- In what sense?
- I knew it. I knew it.

47:27.437 --> 47:29.837
I'm waiting for
my sexual prime.

47:29.906 --> 47:32.898
Just when do you think
that's gonna happen?

47:34.377 --> 47:37.244
<i>In about five minutes.</i>

47:37.313 --> 47:40.305
That's it.
Get the hips going.

47:40.383 --> 47:43.443
Get that Cuban motion going.

47:43.519 --> 47:47.649
Ladies under. Very nice. Good.
Come back around.

47:47.724 --> 47:50.716
<i>- Mom, give me a break.
- Shelly, give me a break.</i>

47:50.793 --> 47:52.886
I danced with the man
one time.

47:52.962 --> 47:56.625
- And you were glowing like Miss Arkansas.
- So I had fun.

47:56.699 --> 47:58.633
Herb's a wonderful dancer.

47:58.701 --> 48:02.000
But he's a doctor,
and you know I hate doctors.

48:02.071 --> 48:04.164
Now, moving to the side.
Hips going.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.401
- There's a class. Let's go join the class.
- Oh, I...

48:06.476 --> 48:08.410
- It'll be fun.
- Well...

48:08.478 --> 48:11.743
<i>- You love dancing!
- Under-arm turn, gentlemen.</i>

48:11.814 --> 48:14.510
<i>- All right.
- Let the ladies under.</i>

48:14.584 --> 48:17.451
<i>- That's it.
- Oh, you guys are getting so good.!</i>

48:17.520 --> 48:19.454
Your turn, madame.

48:19.522 --> 48:21.513
Oh!

48:21.591 --> 48:25.220
Excellent! Now, try everything
that we practiced today.

48:25.294 --> 48:28.730
<i>Okay. Goodjob, everybody.</i>

48:30.199 --> 48:33.396
How 'bout a wonderful hand
for our dancers?

49:01.731 --> 49:05.098
It says that it's a festival,
a sacrifice to purge themselves...

49:05.168 --> 49:07.295
of all sins and evil
before the eclipse.

49:07.370 --> 49:09.600
I'm so excited.
I've never seen an eclipse before.

49:09.672 --> 49:11.606
- Is that right?
- Never seen one.

49:11.674 --> 49:13.608
- I seen one once.
- Really?

49:13.676 --> 49:16.839
But I think the moon
got in the way.

49:18.815 --> 49:20.840
Yes!

49:20.917 --> 49:23.750
Oh. Here we go.
Here we go.

49:36.466 --> 49:39.526
Look how happy they are
that we're here!

49:41.537 --> 49:43.528
La, la-la, la-la

49:46.375 --> 49:48.775
What are you doin'?

49:48.845 --> 49:52.406
Oh, I... I'm looking at this
for a possible suit.

49:56.786 --> 49:58.481
<i>Oh!</i>

49:58.554 --> 50:01.387
Charlie, what are you doing? I want
to stay here and dance with my friends.

50:01.457 --> 50:03.391
- Come with me.
- La-la, la-la

50:03.459 --> 50:05.393
<i>Come with me,
con permiso.</i>

50:05.461 --> 50:08.726
<i>La-la, la-la</i>

50:08.798 --> 50:11.631
- Watch out!
- You stay here. I'll be right back.

50:11.701 --> 50:14.226
- I gotta see a man about a dog.
- Take your time.

50:14.303 --> 50:16.237
La-la, la-la

50:18.908 --> 50:21.342
<i>Mucho viejo. Gracias.</i>

50:21.410 --> 50:24.402
Gil, I've been talking
to the board...

50:24.480 --> 50:27.745
about hiring a vice president
of entertainment.

50:27.817 --> 50:29.751
Interesting.

50:29.819 --> 50:32.879
Listen, is there a way out of here
besides the door?

50:32.955 --> 50:36.254
<i>Oh, yes. SÃ­, sÃ­, sÃ­.
Down the drain.</i>

50:36.325 --> 50:38.259
Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha.

50:38.327 --> 50:42.286
Very funny, pal.
Very funny.

50:47.904 --> 50:52.170
Listen, pal, I need to borrow your mask
for a few minutes.

50:52.241 --> 50:54.971
- Get lost, pops.
- Wait. I'll let you have this.

50:55.044 --> 50:57.774
It's a genuine Rolex.

50:59.282 --> 51:01.409
<i>Please, mister.</i>

51:01.484 --> 51:04.510
This ain't a Rolex.
It says "Romex. "

51:04.587 --> 51:07.579
What, you're gonna make a federal case
out of one lousy letter?

51:07.657 --> 51:10.217
They don't make
Romexes anymore.

51:10.293 --> 51:12.158
<i>- This is a collector's item.
- Beat it.</i>

51:12.228 --> 51:16.358
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I haven't had a chimichanga in years.

51:16.432 --> 51:19.731
Would you mind... Would you
pardon me for just one moment?

51:19.802 --> 51:22.566
- What?
- Eh, nature, you know.

51:22.638 --> 51:24.731
- Sorry.
- Oh.

51:24.807 --> 51:27.469
<i>PerdÃ³name. PerdÃ³name.</i>

51:28.711 --> 51:31.737
- You...
- Do you want to buy a Rolex?

51:31.814 --> 51:35.807
<i>Comin' through.
Â¿QuÃ© pasa, seÃ±or?</i>

51:35.885 --> 51:38.149
What's goin' on here?

51:38.221 --> 51:40.416
<i>Parrot coming through.</i>

51:40.489 --> 51:42.821
Parrot here. Parrot.

51:42.892 --> 51:45.656
<i>Con permiso. Con permiso.</i>

51:49.298 --> 51:51.732
Gil! Whoo-hoo!

51:55.338 --> 51:59.069
<i>Ah.! Leave her alone
for five seconds.</i>

52:00.376 --> 52:03.174
I'm gettin' a little dizzy
in here with all this...

52:03.246 --> 52:06.044
<i>Let me outta here.!</i>

52:06.115 --> 52:08.709
<i>Are you people insane?
Oh, no.!</i>

52:11.687 --> 52:14.554
What do you do
with the bull?

52:14.624 --> 52:17.923
<i>Holy "shaxamahnee'!</i>

52:17.994 --> 52:19.859
Oh, my God!
I'm the parrot!

52:21.764 --> 52:25.564
I see trouble!

52:27.603 --> 52:30.231
Hey, seÃ±or.
Hey, pal.

52:32.308 --> 52:34.868
<i>Gil.! Wait.!</i>

52:41.083 --> 52:44.951
All right, mister.
I've got you!

52:45.021 --> 52:47.717
Oh, sorry. I thought you were...

52:47.790 --> 52:50.418
Oh, my God!

52:50.493 --> 52:52.427
- Charlie.
- Let's go.

52:52.495 --> 52:55.293
- Why are we going now?
- Now is the time to loot the shops.

52:55.364 --> 52:58.891
- We are witnessing history here.
- I've seen history. It stinks.

52:58.968 --> 53:01.960
No, stop!
There's a fire there! Can't you see?

53:02.038 --> 53:04.268
My head's on fire!

53:04.340 --> 53:07.987
Help me!
Stop this cow instantly!

53:16.362 --> 53:19.092
Well, hello.

53:19.165 --> 53:22.896
Stuff works wonders for groin pain.
Cheers to you all.

53:22.968 --> 53:26.927
<i>- I've dug all over Guatemala and all over Honduras.
- Really?</i>

53:27.006 --> 53:30.339
It-It's just... The whole culture
is so interesting...

53:30.409 --> 53:33.640
- so fascinating and...
- Oh, uh, Vivian.

53:33.712 --> 53:36.772
- Herb. What a lovely surprise.
- I know what you're thinking.

53:36.849 --> 53:39.409
- This is my new friend, Sebastian.
- Hello.

53:39.485 --> 53:43.387
He just gave a brilliant lecture on the
significance of the solar eclipse in Mayan mythology.

53:43.455 --> 53:45.355
<i>- What?
- Mayan mythology will tell you...</i>

53:45.424 --> 53:48.018
that an eclipse isn't
really an eclipse at all...

53:48.093 --> 53:53.030
but rather a birth... or an unveiling,
if you will... of a new sun...

53:53.098 --> 53:55.794
- or a new life...
- Fascinating. Herb is a doctor.

53:55.868 --> 53:58.359
<i>- Oh?
- And apparently a dance host on the side.</i>

53:58.437 --> 54:01.304
- I tried to explain this to you.
- Explain what?

54:01.373 --> 54:04.035
I think you did your job
very well.

54:06.278 --> 54:08.269
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

54:08.347 --> 54:11.282
<i>- I've seen him somewhere. He looks familiar.
- Not to me.</i>

54:11.350 --> 54:15.252
- My husband was in the oil business with my dad.
- Ah.

54:15.321 --> 54:17.881
If Daddy trusted him,
I figured I could trust him too.

54:17.957 --> 54:20.926
- So, what happened?
- Well, as it turned out...

54:20.993 --> 54:24.895
there were a lot of test wells
he was drillin' on the side.

54:24.964 --> 54:27.797
- You should've had him neutered.
- Oh, I did.

54:27.867 --> 54:31.166
- Except I used an attorney
instead of a doctor.

54:32.638 --> 54:34.936
For lending a helping hand.
Thank you, chappies.

54:35.007 --> 54:37.237
<i>Thank you so very much.</i>

54:37.309 --> 54:39.800
Oh! What's the matter?

54:39.879 --> 54:42.439
- Are you all right?
- Old football injury.

54:42.514 --> 54:45.415
- College?
- No. Professional.

54:45.484 --> 54:48.078
TheJets blew a 30-point lead
against the Dolphins...

54:48.153 --> 54:51.316
- and I tried to throw
my TV set out the window.

54:51.390 --> 54:53.415
You're in pain. I'll get help.

54:53.492 --> 54:56.893
No! Wait, wait!

54:56.962 --> 55:00.955
- What are you doing? - I wanna
hear more about your ex-husband.

55:01.033 --> 55:04.491
You... What?
How can...

55:04.570 --> 55:06.561
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Oh!

55:06.639 --> 55:09.938
- His back went out,
and I think he needs some help.

55:10.009 --> 55:13.467
- Aw. Would you help me get him on the deck chair?
- Of course.

55:13.545 --> 55:17.709
- God bless you, sir, whosoever you may be.
- Oh, careful. Oh!

55:17.783 --> 55:19.614
If you go
in this direction...

55:19.685 --> 55:22.882
<i>Oh.! What are you doin'?</i>

55:22.955 --> 55:25.116
I have to get the wind
from the east.

55:25.190 --> 55:27.454
<i>- He has to get
the wind from the east.</i>

55:27.526 --> 55:31.622
Now, fortunately,
I'm a retired doctor. Aren't we lucky?

55:31.697 --> 55:33.892
Huh?

55:33.966 --> 55:36.298
- And chiropractics is my specialty.
- It's lucky for me.

55:36.368 --> 55:38.802
- Are you his wife?
- Oh, no. I'm just his friend.

55:38.871 --> 55:41.169
She's just a friend.
You tell me where the pain is.

55:41.240 --> 55:44.641
- It's okay. It's better now.
- Well, I think we may need a little adjustment.

55:44.710 --> 55:47.679
- I don't need...
An adjustment!

55:47.746 --> 55:51.409
- Uh-huh! A problem
in the lumbar region.

55:51.483 --> 55:53.474
No. My "lumber" is all right.

55:53.552 --> 55:56.419
Don't worry about...

56:00.926 --> 56:03.360
Can you feel anything?

56:05.931 --> 56:08.661
Uh, what are you...

56:08.734 --> 56:11.225
Ah! That should
relieve some tension.

56:11.303 --> 56:15.239
<i>- Uh, what the hell are you doin'?
- Now, just breathe normally.</i>

56:15.307 --> 56:18.071
Go on.

56:18.143 --> 56:20.077
I haven't done
anything yet. Uh!

56:24.116 --> 56:27.552
- Do you feel better, my friend?
- I'm gonna get you.

56:27.619 --> 56:29.610
What? A present?
Oh, don't be silly.

56:29.688 --> 56:34.523
Just to lighten the suffering of my fellow
human beings is reward enough for me.

56:37.162 --> 56:39.722
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

56:39.798 --> 56:42.858
Why don't you go.
I'll just rest up here a little while.

56:42.935 --> 56:45.233
Oh, I-I just can't
leave you like this.

56:45.304 --> 56:47.602
<i>- Sure, you can.
- Are you sure?</i>

56:47.673 --> 56:51.131
- Yeah. You go on.
- Actually, I was gonna meet some friends in the casino.

56:51.210 --> 56:54.179
Besides, I like
lying here on the couch.

56:54.246 --> 56:56.407
It's the puppy dog in me.

56:56.482 --> 56:58.609
All right.
I'll see you later.

56:58.684 --> 57:00.675
See you later.

57:00.753 --> 57:03.950
- All right.
- Bye.

57:06.258 --> 57:08.317
"Must be the puppy dog
in me. "

57:08.394 --> 57:10.385
You are in over your head, kid.

57:10.462 --> 57:14.159
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I saw the way you looked at her.

57:14.233 --> 57:17.828
She's a beautiful woman with a lot of
money. How do you want me to look at her?

57:17.903 --> 57:21.930
- I think you care about her.
- Give me a break, will ya?

57:24.410 --> 57:27.277
Oh, boy. I'm gonna sue you
for malpractice.

57:27.346 --> 57:29.337
I saved your ass
is what I did.

57:31.950 --> 57:33.941
Ah.

57:34.019 --> 57:36.613
Gil, baby.
I was wondering...

57:36.688 --> 57:38.952
Oh, shut up.

57:39.024 --> 57:41.254
Tonight, you will dance
every dance.

57:41.326 --> 57:44.921
You will be charming,
attentive, light of foot.

57:44.997 --> 57:47.488
- And I will be watching.
- Yes, sir!

57:48.834 --> 57:51.325
Have Dr. Johanson
look at that eye, Sullivan.

57:53.405 --> 57:56.636
Jesus, Herbie, we've been
pals for such a long time.

57:56.708 --> 57:58.835
Give me a break,
will ya?

57:58.911 --> 58:03.143
- The answer is no.
- If I don't dance, they'll throw me off the ship.

58:03.215 --> 58:05.809
I'll teach you how to swim.
I won't teach you how to dance.

58:05.884 --> 58:07.875
<i>Herbie, please! Please, I beg you.</i>

58:07.953 --> 58:10.649
- Open up your heart.
- Will you knock it off?

58:10.722 --> 58:14.954
- Open your heart to a sad,
frightened old man.

58:15.027 --> 58:19.828
<i>Slow, slow. Quick-quick.</i>

58:19.898 --> 58:23.334
Slow, slow.
Quick-quick.

58:23.402 --> 58:26.633
There you go.
Slow...

58:26.705 --> 58:30.641
Whatever happened
to slow, slow, quick-quick?

58:30.709 --> 58:32.700
You're-You're very much
like a crane.

58:32.778 --> 58:36.475
Slow, slow.
Quick-quick.

58:36.548 --> 58:38.539
Do it.

58:40.219 --> 58:44.622
Slow, slow.
Quick... Oh, God.

58:44.690 --> 58:47.318
Try it. Left, right.

58:49.061 --> 58:51.154
Together.

58:51.230 --> 58:53.323
Aha. Bingo.

58:53.398 --> 58:55.958
Left.

58:56.034 --> 58:58.400
Right. Together.

58:59.638 --> 59:01.629
Very strange.

59:01.707 --> 59:04.039
Okay. This is
the grapevine.

59:04.109 --> 59:06.577
Cross, behind, together.

59:06.645 --> 59:11.275
<i>Slow, slow. Quick-quick.</i>

59:11.350 --> 59:13.443
<i>One, two, three, cha-cha.</i>

59:13.519 --> 59:15.680
One, two, three,
cha-cha.

59:15.754 --> 59:19.588
One, two, three, cha-cha.
One, two, three, cha-cha.

59:19.658 --> 59:22.821
One, two, three, cha-cha.
One...

59:22.895 --> 59:25.693
Okay, now wait a minute.
Let's try...

59:25.764 --> 59:29.495
One, two, three, cha-cha.
One, two, three, cha-cha.

59:29.568 --> 59:33.004
One, two...
Uh, that's very...

59:33.071 --> 59:35.471
What the hell is that?

59:35.541 --> 59:38.203
Guys do this all the time
on the streets...

59:38.277 --> 59:40.211
and-and people
throw money at them.

59:40.279 --> 59:42.474
You're not gettin'
a nickel outta me.

59:47.486 --> 59:49.613
Wait a minute.
This is wrong.

59:49.688 --> 59:53.124
- You're leading.
- I'm supposed to lead. I'm a man.

59:53.192 --> 59:56.320
- Kiss me.
- All right. You lead.

01:00:41.273 --> 01:00:44.265
And on the CD...

01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:53.342
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:53.418 --> 01:00:56.478
- Uh, see, he's, uh... I'm-I'm...
- It's my first time.

01:00:56.555 --> 01:00:59.490
- Oh.
- Dancing, that is, see.

01:00:59.558 --> 01:01:02.322
Yeah. We're just friends.
Good pals, buddies.

01:01:03.528 --> 01:01:06.793
- Oh. Yes, of course.
- Don't ask, don't tell.

01:01:06.865 --> 01:01:09.129
Yeah.

01:01:20.379 --> 01:01:22.973
- Is that a waiter's jacket?
- How can you tell?

01:01:23.048 --> 01:01:25.039
You got stains
all over the sleeve.

01:01:25.117 --> 01:01:28.416
You got parsley down your back.
Fits like a pup tent.

01:01:28.487 --> 01:01:31.081
- Are you kidding...
- Ah! Good evening, gentlemen.

01:01:31.156 --> 01:01:35.217
Time to face the music, eh, Charlie?

01:01:35.294 --> 01:01:39.287
Hey, let-let's face.

01:01:41.466 --> 01:01:44.833
<i>Once again, your host...</i>

01:01:44.903 --> 01:01:50.671
<i>the very talented
Mr. Gil Godwyn.!</i>

01:01:50.742 --> 01:01:52.539
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:55.774
here we are,
under the stars...

01:01:55.847 --> 01:01:59.442
in the moonlight,
out on the open sea.

01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:04.080
Let's get ready...
to rhum-ba.

01:02:04.156 --> 01:02:07.455
Ooh. We're going
to rhum-ba.

01:02:09.761 --> 01:02:11.695
He's demented.

01:02:32.517 --> 01:02:34.747
You're on, champ.

01:02:40.726 --> 01:02:43.559
Care to dance, madam?

01:02:43.628 --> 01:02:45.892
Oh, yes. Yes, I'd love to.

01:02:52.504 --> 01:02:54.802
Don't slouch.

01:02:56.074 --> 01:02:58.702
Have you been hosting
for long?

01:02:58.777 --> 01:03:02.304
This is my 23rd run,
ma'am.

01:03:02.381 --> 01:03:05.509
I started out giving ballroom exhibition.

01:03:14.426 --> 01:03:16.621
Shorten your steps.

01:03:24.236 --> 01:03:27.433
You're doing very well, madam,
but don't rush it.

01:03:27.506 --> 01:03:32.000
- You see, the rhumba is more of a walk than a dance.
- Ouch. Oh.

01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:35.679
- Oh, shit!
- Beg-Beg your pardon?

01:03:35.747 --> 01:03:38.716
<i>Oh. Uh, hit.
This song was a big hit.</i>

01:03:40.886 --> 01:03:45.323
- Oh, what... What does that have to do with the rhumba?
- Absolutely nothing.

01:03:53.465 --> 01:03:55.456
- Look out.
- You said it was a walk.

01:03:55.534 --> 01:03:57.525
It's a fast walk.

01:04:01.239 --> 01:04:03.332
Ow!

01:04:09.648 --> 01:04:11.081
Oh, God.

01:04:18.557 --> 01:04:22.425
Oh! What... What do you call this step?

01:04:22.494 --> 01:04:24.928
- This is the Brazilian creep.
- Oh.

01:04:24.996 --> 01:04:27.260
- In Brazil, of course, it's just called "the creep. "
- Oh.

01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:35.262
Oh.

01:04:41.313 --> 01:04:43.247
Oh, oh, oh!

01:04:49.488 --> 01:04:51.649
Oh. Whoa.

01:05:07.772 --> 01:05:13.267
Oh! Oh!

01:05:31.396 --> 01:05:33.330
- Uh! Oh! I'm so sorry.
- Ow.

01:05:33.398 --> 01:05:35.559
- No. It's our fault.
- Sorry.

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:41.734
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:06:03.728 --> 01:06:05.923
Excuse me.

01:06:07.232 --> 01:06:09.132
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:06:14.005 --> 01:06:17.463
Do you have any idea whom you've just
assaulted on the dance floor?

01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:19.737
Oh, Miss Carruthers,
I don't know what...

01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:22.609
I feel... ravaged.

01:06:22.681 --> 01:06:25.650
Thank you.
I'm Ellen Carruthers.

01:06:25.717 --> 01:06:28.709
Oh. You're the dame that
owns this little boat.

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:34.349
Excuse me.
Uh, duty calls.

01:06:34.426 --> 01:06:36.894
<i>Can I get you
anything, miss?</i>

01:06:39.898 --> 01:06:44.561
<i>All over Honduras. You wouldn't believe
what happened. There were 40,000 people...</i>

01:06:44.636 --> 01:06:49.232
So. It's the broad
that stole our airplane seats.

01:06:49.307 --> 01:06:53.004
- That broad happens to have been an editor at Doubleday.
- Who cares?

01:06:53.078 --> 01:06:55.308
All I was
was a clerk at Gimbel's.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.678
And Secretariat
was just a horse.

01:06:57.749 --> 01:07:00.411
- Go on. Ask her to dance.
- Aw, it's too late, Charlie.

01:07:02.354 --> 01:07:06.347
There's no such thing as "too late. "
That's why they invented death.

01:07:06.424 --> 01:07:08.415
Dance!

01:07:14.966 --> 01:07:17.366
By the Inquisition,
they were burned.

01:07:17.435 --> 01:07:22.304
<i>So now, some people argue,
that they invented the ladle.</i>

01:07:22.374 --> 01:07:25.673
<i>But the ancient drawings indicate
that the Mayans were using...</i>

01:07:25.744 --> 01:07:29.771
<i>- a large perforated scooping utensil.
- Excuse me.</i>

01:07:29.848 --> 01:07:32.214
Um, I'm gonna go
drop the anchor on my toe.

01:07:32.283 --> 01:07:34.376
- I'll go with you.
- You're leaving?

01:07:34.452 --> 01:07:38.752
Anyway, what is really important is that
when I shone the light in the cave...

01:07:38.823 --> 01:07:40.950
there it was on the wall...
the ladle.

01:07:41.026 --> 01:07:43.256
- Vivian?
- Which proved beyond a reasonable doubt... Huh?

01:07:43.328 --> 01:07:48.391
Excuse me. L-I would really be very
honored if you would care to join me.

01:07:48.466 --> 01:07:51.526
I've already
danced this dance.

01:07:51.603 --> 01:07:55.130
Yes, well, I-I- I was hoping
you might want to try it again.

01:07:55.206 --> 01:07:58.642
You know, a, uh,
an archaeologist in ReykjavÃ­k...

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:02.806
- claims that the Incas actually did a form of the hustle.
- What?

01:08:02.881 --> 01:08:05.975
- You-You never heard of that?
I mean, it was a... - You win.

01:08:07.519 --> 01:08:09.510
Excuse us.

01:08:17.395 --> 01:08:19.522
You dance much better
than you lie.

01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:23.363
Well, uh, lying is new to me.
I've been dancing most of my life.

01:08:23.435 --> 01:08:26.631
Hmm. Did you start dancing
before or after medical school?

01:08:26.705 --> 01:08:28.696
Oh, you're a funny lady.

01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:31.002
I'm also
a very serious lady...

01:08:31.076 --> 01:08:33.067
especially when
I'm lied to.

01:08:33.144 --> 01:08:35.908
Hey, I didn't lie to you.
My friend did.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:38.413
<i>Well, you could've
told me the truth.</i>

01:08:38.483 --> 01:08:41.247
- Well, maybe I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:45.085
Well, that you would,
uh, laugh or be disappointed.

01:08:45.156 --> 01:08:47.147
- About what?
- Aw, hell, I don't know.

01:08:47.225 --> 01:08:50.216
- Well, tell me now.
- Tell you what?

01:08:50.295 --> 01:08:52.786
- Try the truth.
- Well, the truth is...

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:55.890
I was just a clerk
at Gimbel's for 35 years...

01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:58.162
till they damn well
went out of business.

01:08:58.236 --> 01:09:00.703
And I got roped into
this stupid dance-host thing...

01:09:00.772 --> 01:09:03.296
by that lunatic there,
over there.

01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:08.876
Just...

01:09:13.718 --> 01:09:15.859
What happened?

01:09:15.993 --> 01:09:19.520
<i>- Wait a second.
- Why? So I can make a fool of myself again?</i>

01:09:31.442 --> 01:09:34.377
I didn't think I'd ever
kiss anybody that way again.

01:09:34.444 --> 01:09:36.470
Neither did I.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.475
- I need to step outside.
- We are outside.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.712
I knew that.

01:09:50.127 --> 01:09:52.187
But won't... won't you
get in trouble...

01:09:52.263 --> 01:09:54.254
I mean, if someone
should see us like this?

01:09:54.332 --> 01:09:57.165
- Oh, well, they could throw me overboard.
- I'd miss you.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.430
Yeah?

01:09:59.504 --> 01:10:03.372
Why don't we watch the, uh, eclipse
together tomorrow?

01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:07.775
- All right.
- Yeah. We could go in separate buses to ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡...

01:10:07.845 --> 01:10:09.836
and meet at a cafÃ©.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:13.441
- What cafÃ©?
- Well, it's a town. There must be a cafÃ©.

01:10:13.518 --> 01:10:16.316
I'll find it, and...
and you'll find me.

01:10:16.387 --> 01:10:20.483
<i>Oh.</i>

01:10:20.558 --> 01:10:24.585
- It's been my pleasure, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you very much.

01:10:24.662 --> 01:10:28.098
Hey, Gil,
I loved the number.

01:10:28.166 --> 01:10:30.157
Oh. Thank you.

01:10:32.236 --> 01:10:34.363
There are almost a dozen
in the fleet now.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.999
This is the baby,
my little jewel.

01:10:37.075 --> 01:10:39.202
- Madam?
- Well, hello there.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:42.769
Oh, how do you do?
Mr. Godwyn asked me to give you this.

01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:45.941
Oh, thank you.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:58.789
Would you excuse me,
please?

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:01.024
- How charming you look tonight.
- Thanks.

01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:05.229
<i>- Oh, Mr. Godwyn.
- Why aren't you dancing?</i>

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:10.070
Because Mrs. Carruthers...
asked me to give you a message.

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.132
- Really.
- Yes. I have a feeling, sir...

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:14.974
that you're gonna get that promotion
you've been looking for.

01:11:15.046 --> 01:11:17.037
Did... Did she say that?

01:11:17.115 --> 01:11:20.380
She said she wants you
in her room...

01:11:20.451 --> 01:11:23.477
<i>A.S.P.C. A...
A.S.A.P.</i>

01:11:23.554 --> 01:11:25.852
Her room? Now?

01:11:27.258 --> 01:11:30.716
Her exact words were...

01:11:31.963 --> 01:11:35.194
Well, I don't remember them
off-hand, but, uh...

01:11:35.266 --> 01:11:37.894
- Come on, man.
- Uh, "If not sooner. "

01:11:40.872 --> 01:11:43.033
- Get on that dance floor.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:48.536
- Hi there.
- Yes?

01:11:48.613 --> 01:11:51.241
Gotta deliver Godwyn's shirts
to his room.

01:11:51.315 --> 01:11:53.510
- Oh, you need the key.
- Yeah. I'm not gonna slip them under the door.

01:11:53.584 --> 01:11:55.575
They'll get wrinkled.

01:11:57.989 --> 01:12:00.014
Hello, hello, hello.

01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:03.219
Oh, hello. You sure made
a fast recovery, didn't you?

01:12:03.294 --> 01:12:05.285
Nothing like being young.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:11.100
Why do you look at me as though
I were nothing but trouble?

01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:14.229
- I like trouble.
- I like you too.

01:12:14.305 --> 01:12:16.603
- How about a game of poker?
- Poker, okay.

01:12:16.674 --> 01:12:21.976
But I gotta warn you, Carswell. This time,
I'm not tearing up any of your checks.

01:12:24.115 --> 01:12:26.743
<i>Domo.</i>

01:12:26.817 --> 01:12:30.947
I think you're a phony, chum,
and I'm going to prove it.

01:12:31.022 --> 01:12:35.959
- Oh, boy.
- Nice to see you're relaxing tonight, Carswell.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:55.973
- I beg your pardon?
- Take a hike. Hi.

01:12:56.047 --> 01:12:58.607
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

01:12:58.683 --> 01:13:02.278
- Two vodka stingers, and I lost my key.
- Oh.

01:13:02.353 --> 01:13:06.790
- How about you?
- I work here.

01:13:07.892 --> 01:13:09.883
You do?

01:13:09.961 --> 01:13:12.930
Uh, do you do...
C.P.R.?

01:13:14.632 --> 01:13:17.100
How does it go?

01:13:48.065 --> 01:13:50.533
<i>It's open.</i>

01:13:52.036 --> 01:13:55.528
<i>Mrs. Carruthers?</i>

01:13:58.943 --> 01:14:01.639
<i>Ellen.
Bit of bubbly?</i>

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:06.113
<i>Ace, queen bets.</i>

01:14:06.183 --> 01:14:08.174
I will check.

01:14:09.854 --> 01:14:11.913
Check, check.

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:14.355
I check.

01:14:15.359 --> 01:14:18.089
<i>Two, please.</i>

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:23.156
<i>- I bet 20 grand.
- I'll take one.</i>

01:14:23.234 --> 01:14:28.069
- Hmm.
- Too rich for my blood.

01:14:28.139 --> 01:14:30.869
I fold.

01:14:31.942 --> 01:14:34.740
- Hmm.
- How much you bet?

01:14:34.812 --> 01:14:37.713
- Twenty thousand dollars.
- Twenty thousand dollars.

01:14:37.782 --> 01:14:40.717
Right.

01:14:40.785 --> 01:14:44.687
Oopsy doopsy woopsy.
Call.

01:14:48.759 --> 01:14:50.727
I'm out.

01:14:50.795 --> 01:14:52.786
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You all right?

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:56.731
- Yes, of course I'm all right.
- Does anyone have a napkin or something?

01:14:56.801 --> 01:15:01.636
- Card in sleeve. He's a cheat. You were right, Mr. Gordon.
- Pretty sloppy, Carswell.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:04.231
- That's disgusting.
- But to prove that he was a fraud.

01:15:04.308 --> 01:15:06.902
I'm gonna overlook this whole thing
because you are an asshole.

01:15:06.977 --> 01:15:10.310
<i>Monsieur Gordon is right.
You are an asshole.</i>

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:13.043
<i>Gentlemen, I've never done anything
like this before in my life.</i>

01:15:13.117 --> 01:15:15.312
I'm afraid you'll have to leave
the casino, sir.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:19.914
- Gentlemen, please believe me.
- It doesn't matter what we believe, does it, Carswell?

01:15:23.127 --> 01:15:25.152
Tra la.

01:15:26.931 --> 01:15:30.731
All right. This hand is dead.
Everybody will get their money back.

01:15:33.504 --> 01:15:37.270
- What say we go someplace quiet for a night cap?
- Someplace quiet?

01:15:37.341 --> 01:15:39.866
- Yeah.
- Right. Like your room, right?

01:15:39.944 --> 01:15:42.777
- Wonderful suggestion.
- No.

01:15:42.847 --> 01:15:46.305
No, that wasn't
my suggestion.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.611
- Oh.
- Madam.

01:15:51.689 --> 01:15:56.126
- Thank you. Oh, this is a nice suite, Charlie.
- Isn't that nice?

01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:08.196
Charlie, about your cologne.

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:10.331
Oh, it's not cologne.
It's aftershave lotion.

01:16:10.408 --> 01:16:13.866
You ever thought of,
uh, growing a beard?

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:17.402
- Oh, yeah. Sometimes.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:20.507
Uh...

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:26.556
<i>Oh, Charlie.!</i>

01:16:33.197 --> 01:16:35.529
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:16:35.599 --> 01:16:38.500
<i>It should be another day
of calm seas and smooth sailing.</i>

01:16:38.569 --> 01:16:42.335
<i>For your convenience, if you're in a hurry
to meet your shore tour for the eclipse...</i>

01:16:51.715 --> 01:16:53.740
Oh!

01:17:00.891 --> 01:17:03.052
That's above and beyond
the call of duty.

01:17:03.127 --> 01:17:05.254
Yeah. He should
make captain for that.

01:17:16.106 --> 01:17:19.542
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.

01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:21.737
Oh!

01:17:27.284 --> 01:17:29.514
Armor All?

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:36.182
I really had a good time
last night, Charlie.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.423
- I really enjoyed myself.
- L-I... I just wanted...

01:17:39.497 --> 01:17:41.692
Shh, shh.
You don't have to.

01:17:45.336 --> 01:17:48.271
Oh. What happened
to the good-lookin' one?

01:17:48.339 --> 01:17:51.604
This is
a good-lookin' one, Ma.

01:17:51.675 --> 01:17:53.666
See you later.

01:17:56.747 --> 01:17:58.738
Huh.

01:18:08.826 --> 01:18:11.624
Yah! I'll race you
around the ship, pal.

01:18:26.944 --> 01:18:29.208
<i>Bravo! Bravissimo.!
Bravo!</i>

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:46.059
After a lifetime of wandering
through the deserts of humanity...

01:18:47.464 --> 01:18:53.027
- I find in you my oasis...
- That's terrible.

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:58.841
The doctors say I have
only a few more months.

01:18:58.909 --> 01:19:01.537

01:19:04.815 --> 01:19:06.942
You barely know
this woman.

01:19:07.017 --> 01:19:10.384
Liz, I would be honored
if you took my last name...

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:12.718
and put it
on your bank account.

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.985
That's the one.

Well, the one-ounce bottle
is beautiful.

01:19:24.335 --> 01:19:26.599
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:35.335
I finally figured it out,
seeing you here in the gift shop.

01:19:35.412 --> 01:19:39.576
Back at St. Vincent's? Seems like I was
always running into you in the gift shop.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.641
St. Vincent?

01:19:41.719 --> 01:19:43.914
Oh, my God.
It's Nurse Collins.

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:47.856
- Oh. I can't believe
that I didn't recognize you.

01:19:47.925 --> 01:19:49.916
It's probably not one of your
better memories.

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:52.827
Oh, no, no. Come on.
Suzie was nuts about you.

01:19:52.896 --> 01:19:55.990
- The feeling was mutual.
- Yeah.

01:19:56.066 --> 01:19:58.728
You, on the other hand,
were a complete pain in the butt.

01:19:58.802 --> 01:20:00.793
Yeah.

01:20:00.871 --> 01:20:05.433
- I've got exactly 20 minutes. How about a cup of coffee?
- Love it.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:09.036
<i>Passengers going ashore,
please report to tender deck, midship.</i>

01:20:09.113 --> 01:20:13.846

<i>when-when...
when we both felt...</i>

01:20:16.987 --> 01:20:19.182
I don't know how...

01:20:19.256 --> 01:20:23.158
That we weren't going
to let this thing beat us.

01:20:23.227 --> 01:20:27.129
- Yeah. You guys were one of those couples.
- Yeah.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:30.598
I remember on the last night... By
that time, there's so much medication...

01:20:30.668 --> 01:20:33.102
who knows whether they understand
what's goin' on, but...

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:37.800
I remember you leaning
right down next to her ear...

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:42.141
telling her you'd be in love with her
always and forever.

01:20:43.514 --> 01:20:47.712
<i>Shejust had this...
I don't know.</i>

01:20:47.785 --> 01:20:50.413
It was like a light
in her eyes.

01:20:50.487 --> 01:20:52.478
You knew she knew.

01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:57.890
I shouldn't be saying this.

01:20:57.961 --> 01:21:00.794
Oh, no, no.
It's nice, really.

01:21:00.864 --> 01:21:03.389
It's fine. It's...

01:21:07.204 --> 01:21:09.638
- Oh. Weren't you going ashore?
- Huh?

01:21:09.707 --> 01:21:12.039
The eclipse.
I don't wanna miss it.

01:21:12.109 --> 01:21:14.441
Oh, yeah.

01:21:14.511 --> 01:21:18.003
Well, uh, listen, uh...
It-It was great...

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:20.073
- Oh.
- You know, seeing you.

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:22.141
Really. Very, very nice.

01:21:22.219 --> 01:21:24.119

- Liz.
- Yeah?

known each other a short time...

Liz, will you listen to me for a minute?

- Oh!
- Even though we're like two ships passing through the night...

- Great. We got it all on video.

Fine. I won't speak

- I'm going home.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:24:02.402

- No. No. It's your anniversary.

01:26:31.131 --> 01:26:34.794
Hmm.
That's a familiar cologne, Mr. Gordon.

Yes. Thank you. You can
pick it up anywhere.

some up this morning... on my pillow.

01:27:34.794 --> 01:27:36.785
- Well, where's your mother?
- She's not coming back on board.

01:27:36.863 --> 01:27:38.854
You can tell your friend
she's going home.

01:27:38.932 --> 01:27:41.025
- Where's my friend?
- Question of the day.

01:27:58.418 --> 01:28:01.353
- What the hell are you doin' up here?
- Oh, hi.

01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:07.091
Ah, Charlie, I'm...
I'm still in love with Suzie.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.062
- It seems to present a problem.
- It's only a problem if you want it to be.

01:28:11.131 --> 01:28:14.726
- Don't start with me, huh?
- Go on after Vivian. Go now.

01:28:14.801 --> 01:28:17.895
- Look, I hardly know her.
- You know her, and you're crazy about her.

01:28:17.971 --> 01:28:20.838
The question is, have you got the balls
to do anything about it?

01:28:20.907 --> 01:28:24.741
- Well, I... I'm just not ready yet.
- Then get ready.

01:28:24.811 --> 01:28:27.678
- You're here now. You're living.
You're breathing. You got a choice.

01:28:27.747 --> 01:28:31.581
- I can't do it.
- Will you stop using Suzie as a safety net.

01:28:31.651 --> 01:28:33.676
Wait a minute. Who in the hell
are you to tell me...

01:28:33.753 --> 01:28:36.722
She was my sister
before she was your wife.

01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:38.781
If she were here now,
she'd tell you the same thing.

01:28:38.858 --> 01:28:41.691
But she is not here now,
is she, Charlie?

01:28:41.761 --> 01:28:43.752
She's gone.

01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:46.264
That's right, Herb,
but you're not.

01:28:56.810 --> 01:29:01.008
- What the hell am I doin' here?
- That's what I asked you in the first place.

01:29:01.081 --> 01:29:03.709
I am not authorized
to give you that information.

01:29:03.783 --> 01:29:07.219
Hey, I'm not authorized to throw
your ass overboard, but I'll do it.

01:29:07.287 --> 01:29:09.687
Now tell me
where she is.

01:29:09.756 --> 01:29:14.352
You'd better tell him, mister. This man's
got a black belt in sum flung dung...

01:29:14.427 --> 01:29:16.520
or one of them things.

01:29:16.596 --> 01:29:20.862
Please.

01:29:20.934 --> 01:29:24.529
All right, look. All I know is we got
a message that she's flying home.

01:29:24.604 --> 01:29:26.595
- She's flying?
- Yes.

01:29:26.673 --> 01:29:28.664
- From where?
- I have no idea.

01:29:28.775 --> 01:29:30.800
All right, all right.

01:29:30.877 --> 01:29:34.643
Stop the car. Stop the car.
Stop the car!

01:29:34.714 --> 01:29:37.205
Stop... Stop the car.

01:29:37.283 --> 01:29:41.083
Oh, my Lord!
Where in the...

01:29:44.524 --> 01:29:48.016
Oh. Look, I don't think
you understand us at all.

01:29:48.094 --> 01:29:50.995
We want to go
to the airport.

01:29:51.064 --> 01:29:54.591
<i>- SÃ­, seÃ±ora. The airport.
- That thing?</i>

01:29:54.667 --> 01:29:56.658
- Oh, my Lord.
- I get the luggage.

01:29:56.736 --> 01:29:59.364
<i>No. Leave the luggage where it is, please.</i>

01:29:59.439 --> 01:30:01.339
<i>Wait a minute.
I see somebody.</i>

01:30:01.408 --> 01:30:04.741
Right out of the corner of my eye.
Don't you move.

01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:07.905
You stay right where you are.
Come on, dear.

01:30:07.981 --> 01:30:11.542
<i>Come on. Uh, excuse me,
but maybe you could help me.</i>

01:30:11.618 --> 01:30:14.610
<i>This crazy cab driver's
tryin'to tell me that this is a...</i>

01:30:14.687 --> 01:30:17.918
<i>- "aerioporto. "
- SÃ­.</i>

01:30:17.991 --> 01:30:21.620
<i>- Ayayay.
- I don't believe this. I don't believe this.</i>

01:30:21.694 --> 01:30:23.685
<i>All right, if this
is the "aerioporto... "</i>

01:30:23.763 --> 01:30:26.027
<i>then maybe you can
show me a... a piloto.</i>

01:30:26.099 --> 01:30:29.626
- You're looking at him.
- What?

01:30:29.702 --> 01:30:31.829
You want a lift,
sweetcakes?

01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:38.201
- My God Almighty, did you hear what he just called me?
- Sure did.

01:30:49.222 --> 01:30:52.783
- Come on.
- Are you crazy? This is dangerous.

01:30:52.859 --> 01:30:54.850
What's the matter, Charlie?
You afraid to live a little?

01:30:54.928 --> 01:30:58.091
Living is good.
It's dying I'm worried about.

01:30:59.799 --> 01:31:03.735
Where are Gordon and Sullivan?

01:31:03.803 --> 01:31:06.499
And don't give me any of that
"code among comrades" crap.

01:31:06.573 --> 01:31:08.564
Sir! Don't have
the foggiest. Sir!

01:31:09.576 --> 01:31:11.908
Oh, bollocks!

01:31:11.978 --> 01:31:14.811
Uh... Pardon me.
Pardon me.

01:31:14.881 --> 01:31:17.247
This should be good.

01:31:17.317 --> 01:31:20.047
- $500 cash.
- Are you out of your mind?

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.850
- That's too much money.
- That doesn't mean I ain't a good pilot.

01:31:25.058 --> 01:31:28.858
Look at this. Look at this.
It's J.F.K. All of a sudden.

01:31:28.928 --> 01:31:30.919
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

01:31:30.997 --> 01:31:33.625
I have an idea, Ma.
Just stay with me.

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.533
Good evenin'. I don't know you,
but this man over here...

01:31:36.603 --> 01:31:39.731
<i>says that he will charge us $500
to get to a real airport.</i>

01:31:39.806 --> 01:31:41.967
Now, would you be interested
in splittin' that with us?

01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:44.509
- Absolutely.
- You got a deal.

01:31:44.577 --> 01:31:46.568
You wanna ride shotgun?

01:31:46.646 --> 01:31:49.274
Don't touch me.

01:31:49.349 --> 01:31:52.284
- Okay, get ready, kid.
- And where do we think we're going?

01:31:52.352 --> 01:31:56.880
Oh, hi there. We're just gonna go
scouting for some icebergs.

01:31:56.956 --> 01:32:01.052
You two geezers aren't going anywhere except
back to your cabin where you will stay...

01:32:01.127 --> 01:32:04.062
Listen to me, you sniveling
little brownnose!

01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:07.896
I have lived for 71 years,
I fought a war, I buried my wife...

01:32:07.967 --> 01:32:12.233
and I have survived
48 white sales at Gimbel's.

01:32:12.305 --> 01:32:17.504
<i>So if you think that some little fop like you
is gonna stop me, you got another think comin!</i>

01:32:17.577 --> 01:32:19.807
How dare you
speak to me that way!

01:32:19.879 --> 01:32:23.178
- May I speak to you for a moment, please?
- No, you may not!

01:32:23.249 --> 01:32:25.581
Oh!

01:32:25.652 --> 01:32:27.677
Way to go, Charlie!

01:32:29.722 --> 01:32:32.520
I can't stop it, Charlie!

01:32:32.592 --> 01:32:34.184
Hang on, Charlie!

01:32:36.729 --> 01:32:38.321
We're gonna hit!

01:32:40.099 --> 01:32:43.193
Bon voyage, meathead.

01:32:43.269 --> 01:32:45.703
I hope your boat
capsizes...

01:32:45.772 --> 01:32:48.434
and you drown
like bloody rats!

01:32:48.508 --> 01:32:52.308
<i>- Bye.!
- When that old bag makes me V. P...</i>

01:32:52.378 --> 01:32:55.040
I'll see to it you never work
another cruise ship...

01:32:55.114 --> 01:32:57.708
as long as you live!

01:32:57.784 --> 01:32:59.718
Hah!

01:33:02.655 --> 01:33:05.715
Good evening, Ellen.
Eh...

01:33:05.792 --> 01:33:08.226
- What are you doing out here?
- You know, Gil...

01:33:08.294 --> 01:33:11.889
I find it hard to believe, but
it really is true. You are an asshole.

01:33:11.965 --> 01:33:15.958
- Oh. I'm simply doing my job.
- Oh, you have no job.

01:33:16.035 --> 01:33:18.629
<i>You're fired.
Mac?</i>

01:33:18.705 --> 01:33:21.970
- As of now, you are my new C.D.
- No...

01:33:23.042 --> 01:33:25.033
What about me?

01:33:25.111 --> 01:33:27.341
You're...
his friend.

01:33:29.882 --> 01:33:31.873
What the hell
is she talking about?

01:33:31.951 --> 01:33:34.681
She's talkin' about
"button that button," you little prick.

01:33:36.122 --> 01:33:39.091
Prick.

01:33:44.564 --> 01:33:46.930
You know what
I don't see? Land.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.629
- It's there.
- I see nothing but night.

01:33:50.703 --> 01:33:53.831
Hope we don't get stranded.

01:33:53.906 --> 01:33:56.101
You know, these are
shark-infested waters.

01:33:56.175 --> 01:33:59.269
We're not
gonna get stranded.

01:33:59.345 --> 01:34:01.609
They say that the big ones
will swallow you whole.

01:34:01.681 --> 01:34:03.808
Swallow my what?

01:34:03.883 --> 01:34:06.613
You're not helping me,
Charles.

01:34:06.686 --> 01:34:10.122
- Here, let me do that.
- What makes you think you can do it?

01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:13.056
- Because I'm taller than you are.
- Oh, that has nothin' to do with it, taller.

01:34:13.126 --> 01:34:15.993
It's in...
It's in the wrist.

01:34:16.062 --> 01:34:18.053
<i>We did it.</i>

01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:19.996
- We did it.
- Yeah.

01:34:23.636 --> 01:34:26.002
Well, it turns nicely.

01:34:26.072 --> 01:34:28.563
Sit down, will ya, so I
can see where I'm goin'.

01:34:28.641 --> 01:34:30.632
Eh!

01:34:32.211 --> 01:34:34.236
<i>- Are you from the cruise?
- Uh-huh.</i>

01:34:34.314 --> 01:34:36.714
<i>- I thought so.
- Now, here he comes.</i>

01:34:36.783 --> 01:34:39.809
- Be careful. Watch your head.
- Good evening, ladies, and welcome aboard.

01:34:39.886 --> 01:34:43.083
<i>- Oh, my God.
- And thank you for choosing Vaya Azul.</i>

01:34:43.156 --> 01:34:47.354
Oh, my God.

01:34:47.427 --> 01:34:51.295
Piece of shit.

01:34:51.364 --> 01:34:54.128
Which one of the Wright brothers
did you buy this from?

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.327
Probably the one you
dated in high school.

01:34:56.402 --> 01:34:58.927
Ooh! I feel so much better.
That's very reassuring.

01:34:59.005 --> 01:35:02.168
We have a funny pilot!

01:35:02.241 --> 01:35:04.709
Hold it! My God! What are you doing?

01:35:04.777 --> 01:35:06.836
I wanna get out of here, Ma.

01:35:06.913 --> 01:35:09.438
We're goin'!
We're goin'!

01:35:21.728 --> 01:35:23.992
Take it easy now. Oh, my Lord!

01:35:26.232 --> 01:35:29.258
There! A plane!

01:35:29.335 --> 01:35:31.326
<i>There's a plane.</i>

01:35:31.404 --> 01:35:33.702
- Is she in it?
- I don't know.

01:35:33.773 --> 01:35:36.867
Do you see a telescope
attached to my head?

01:35:36.943 --> 01:35:39.036
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on. Let's go.

01:35:39.112 --> 01:35:41.376
- Come on, baby! Come on.
- Ooh-ooh!

01:35:43.683 --> 01:35:46.049
Ah! Ah!

01:35:46.119 --> 01:35:48.349
<i>- Wait.! Wait.!
- Wait.! Wait.! Hold it.!</i>

01:35:48.421 --> 01:35:50.582
<i>- Wait.! Stop.!
- Wait a minute.!</i>

01:35:50.656 --> 01:35:55.525
<i>- Wait for us.!
- It's Herbie.! Herbie and his friend.!</i>

01:35:55.595 --> 01:35:57.563
<i>Wait a minute.! Hold it.!</i>

01:35:57.630 --> 01:36:01.862
<i>Oh, God.! Ah.!</i>

01:36:01.934 --> 01:36:03.697
Hold it!
Hold it!

01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:06.068
Wait! Wait!

01:36:07.206 --> 01:36:09.265
Wait a minute! Wait!

01:36:09.342 --> 01:36:12.038
Down here!

01:36:14.447 --> 01:36:16.574
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:36:16.649 --> 01:36:19.379
Turn back!

01:36:19.452 --> 01:36:22.285
They're not gonna hear a whistle,
for cryin' out loud.

01:36:22.355 --> 01:36:24.380
<i>Hey.!</i>

01:36:29.695 --> 01:36:32.960
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

01:36:33.032 --> 01:36:35.398
<i>- What are you doin'?
- You'll see.</i>

01:36:37.537 --> 01:36:41.064
- What are you doin'?
- Yeah.

01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:43.472
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:36:43.543 --> 01:36:45.909
<i>What are you gonna do,
shoot down the plane?</i>

01:36:47.413 --> 01:36:49.847
Oh, my God.

01:36:58.224 --> 01:37:00.818
It's a flare.

01:37:00.893 --> 01:37:04.329
- See the flare?
- Now, turn for God sakes.

01:37:04.397 --> 01:37:06.661
<i>- See it? Turn.
- Turn.! Come back.!</i>

01:37:09.335 --> 01:37:11.326
Come back!
Turn around!

01:37:12.872 --> 01:37:15.340
Ensign... Matowski.

01:37:15.408 --> 01:37:18.866
- What?
- Herb.

01:37:24.317 --> 01:37:27.115
Oh, my God.
That can't be Charlie.

01:37:29.288 --> 01:37:31.222
No way.

01:37:33.626 --> 01:37:35.617
- Turn the plane around.
- It's probably just...

01:37:35.695 --> 01:37:38.528
- What is your problem?
- Just do it.

01:37:38.598 --> 01:37:42.227
<i>- Come back.!
- Do it, baby.!</i>

01:37:42.301 --> 01:37:45.031
Turn... Yes!
He's turning!

01:37:45.104 --> 01:37:50.565
- Way to go!
- Whoa-ho! Ha-ha!

01:38:15.731 --> 01:38:18.666
- Liz.
- Charlie.

01:38:23.372 --> 01:38:26.170
- You're late.
- Yeah.

01:38:26.242 --> 01:38:29.268
I had a little, uh,
trouble getting started.

01:38:40.256 --> 01:38:43.692
The-The plane was...
Windy, you know?

01:38:43.759 --> 01:38:45.750
- Yeah. Windy on the plane.
- It made my eyes water.

01:38:45.828 --> 01:38:48.729
It does that, yeah.
Oh, look at that.

01:38:55.337 --> 01:38:57.328
Liz.

01:38:58.674 --> 01:39:02.166
From the first moment
I saw you on that ship...

01:39:02.244 --> 01:39:06.180
- it was my intention to lie to you, I swear.
- Oh, that's sweet.

01:39:06.248 --> 01:39:10.184
What I didn't intend was
falling in love with you.

01:39:13.923 --> 01:39:16.585
Well, okay.

01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:19.025
The deal is...

01:39:19.094 --> 01:39:21.119
that I'm as big a liar
as you, Charlie.

01:39:21.197 --> 01:39:24.496
- I highly doubt it.
- I'm broke.

01:39:27.036 --> 01:39:30.972
- I'm sure you're exaggerating.
- No, I'm not.

01:39:33.375 --> 01:39:37.141
Not even...
a couple hundred thousand?

01:39:37.213 --> 01:39:39.613
Not even.

01:39:39.682 --> 01:39:42.344
Zip. Flat broke.

01:39:46.322 --> 01:39:50.520
Sorry. Door's open.
It's not too late. You can leave.

01:39:50.593 --> 01:39:53.027
No. I don't wanna get out.

01:39:54.797 --> 01:39:56.788
I don't wanna leave.

01:40:00.436 --> 01:40:03.701
Uh, how long
is all this gonna take?

01:40:03.772 --> 01:40:07.868
Hah! Couple of gold diggers
comin' up empty.

01:40:07.943 --> 01:40:09.934
That's terrific.

01:40:10.012 --> 01:40:13.743
We still got the check
from Carswell for $18,000.

01:40:13.816 --> 01:40:17.718
Wait a minute. What are you
talkin' about? I saw you...

01:40:18.787 --> 01:40:21.415
You taped it?

01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:24.516
What do I look like, a schmuck?

01:40:24.593 --> 01:40:27.619
The jury's still out
on that one.

01:40:27.696 --> 01:40:29.789
Shut up, Ma.
We're keepin' him.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.593
Thank you.

01:40:39.375 --> 01:40:42.902
<i>Fifty dollars apiece
for picking up the two studs.</i>

01:40:42.978 --> 01:40:46.277
<i>They ought to give you
50 bucks each for callin' 'em studs.</i>

01:40:46.348 --> 01:40:48.339
<i>Herbie,
lend me 50 bucks, will you?</i>

01:40:48.417 --> 01:40:50.408
<i>All I got is this check.</i>

01:40:50.486 --> 01:40:52.977
<i>You're not gettin'
a nickel out of me, Charlie.</i>

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:54.162
- Let me just say...
- Did you come...

01:43:55.904 --> 01:43:59.465
You got any, uh...
crack on you?

01:44:03.812 --> 01:44:07.270
Instead... Instead of-of...

01:44:07.349 --> 01:44:12.480
Instead of-of paying
for this cruise...

01:44:13.689 --> 01:44:15.680
It's comin' to me.

01:44:15.757 --> 01:44:20.785
See, we go to schmeer...

01:44:25.534 --> 01:44:28.594
Baby, you talkin' about
humpback whales?

01:44:28.670 --> 01:44:30.934
- I was talking about humping, actually.
- Yeah.

01:44:31.006 --> 01:44:34.373
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:44:34.443 --> 01:44:39.176
I just found us a couple
of chest butchers that'll whip it out.

01:44:43.585 --> 01:44:47.021
Where were you?

01:44:47.089 --> 01:44:51.355
A pas... A passenger
requested an escort, sir.

01:44:51.426 --> 01:44:53.417
Indeed.
A likely excuse.

01:44:53.495 --> 01:44:56.396
So I slipped her one in the lifeboat.

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.631
Ah, shit.

01:45:09.378 --> 01:45:12.245
Oh. Look who's here.

01:45:20.222 --> 01:45:23.623
You better tell him, mister.
This man's got a martial arts thing...

01:45:23.692 --> 01:45:27.389
in black belt schmeer.

01:45:27.462 --> 01:45:30.158
So if you think that some snot-nosed
little fop like you...

01:45:30.232 --> 01:45:34.032
is gonna m... stop me, then...
Pinch me, Walter.

01:45:34.102 --> 01:45:37.299
So if you think some snotty little fop
like you is gonna change me...

01:45:37.372 --> 01:45:42.537
or me up,
then, uh, I'll it up myself.

01:45:42.611 --> 01:45:46.547
Even though we've
known each other for a short time...

01:45:50.953 --> 01:45:53.615
The moon... is up your ass.

01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:55.816
<i>Keep looking at Dyan.</i>

01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:59.418
- Don't try to grab my thing.
- Oh, isn't that attractive.

01:45:59.494 --> 01:46:03.294
- I wouldn't hold my thing.
- What about Walter's hand?

01:46:03.365 --> 01:46:05.765
<i>Oh, Char...</i>

01:46:05.834 --> 01:46:08.962
I really had a good time.

01:46:09.037 --> 01:46:12.165
- I wanna tell you somethin'.
- Tell me. Tell me.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.403
I have never had
a better piece of ass.

01:46:20.382 --> 01:46:23.647
La la la la
la la la la...

01:46:23.719 --> 01:46:26.813
<i>Did I hear "cut"?</i>

01:46:26.888 --> 01:46:28.549
<i>Great.!</i>

01:46:29.491 --> 01:46:32.016
Dismissed.
