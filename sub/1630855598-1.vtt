Stone, how we doing?

01:07.083 --> 01:09.875
<i>Almost there.
Just pulling the encryption key.</i>

01:09.875 --> 01:12.583
Four hours in the van,
and she's eaten all the crisps.

01:12.583 --> 01:15.166
She's stuck in there with you,
so that's comfort eating.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.375
Been boring her with your cat chat again?

01:17.375 --> 01:21.250
Cat chat? Actually, Parker,
she likes my Barry the Cat stories.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.458
You like my Barry the Cat stories, right?

01:23.458 --> 01:26.250
Before you know it,
you're gonna want one of your own.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.791
Cats hate me. Sorry, Bailey.

01:28.791 --> 01:30.416
Writing a new access code.

01:31.708 --> 01:32.708
<i>Grazie.</i>

01:34.750 --> 01:36.125
I have eyes on Mulvaney.

01:36.125 --> 01:37.166
Intel was good.

01:38.041 --> 01:39.458
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

01:39.458 --> 01:43.916
<i>Europe's most wanted arms dealer
seen for the first time in three years.</i>

01:44.500 --> 01:46.916
Adding names and faces to the guest list.

01:47.791 --> 01:50.208
- How long do you need?
<i>-</i> <i>Nearly there.</i>

01:52.708 --> 01:55.333
Hang on. Something's changed.
I can't connect.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.291
The system's offline.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.458
Local access only.

02:00.375 --> 02:02.500
<i>We need a new plan to get you in.</i>

02:02.500 --> 02:03.416
What do you mean?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.791
I need direct access
to someone who's already on the network.

02:09.416 --> 02:11.333
Head of security. He's at the bar.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.791
<i>I could hack his phone,
but I'll need to be close to him.</i>

02:17.875 --> 02:19.833
- How close?
- Ten feet.

02:19.833 --> 02:23.333
<i>Stone, you're not a field agent.
Do not get out of the van.</i>

02:24.166 --> 02:25.166
She can do this.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.750
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

02:31.666 --> 02:33.125
<i>Mulvaney's entering now.</i>

02:40.125 --> 02:43.291
Our arms dealer's on the move right now,
and I do not wanna lose him.

02:43.291 --> 02:45.708
<i>There's no other way.
We have to get Mulvaney.</i>

02:46.291 --> 02:47.291
Tell me what you need.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.583
When I'm within ten feet
of the head of security, call his phone.

02:53.583 --> 02:54.833
Okay, got it.

02:55.750 --> 02:56.666
Hey. Hey, Stone.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.041
You got this.

03:00.875 --> 03:01.791
Thanks, Bailey.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.208
I can't tail them any further.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.875
<i>Stone, listen to me.
Waiter to your right.</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:29.291
<i>Grab a glass of champagne.</i>

03:30.208 --> 03:31.875
- Thank you.
-  <i>Good. Now, drink it.</i>

03:33.208 --> 03:34.125
<i>Liquid courage.</i>

03:39.416 --> 03:41.416
<i>He's headed towards the blackjack table.</i>

03:42.875 --> 03:44.000
Do you know how to play?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.375
I was on the chess team.

03:46.875 --> 03:47.833
Oh my God.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.916
<i>-</i> <i>Just place a bet.</i>
- Welcome.

03:53.416 --> 03:54.833
<i>Doesn't matter if you lose.</i>

03:57.500 --> 03:59.708
Change set, seven. One hundred.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.708
- One hundred, change seven.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.250
Okay, I have access.

04:15.250 --> 04:18.875
One hundred, sir, in change.
Okay. Everybody ready?

04:18.875 --> 04:20.250
He's looking suspicious.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.583
Place your bets.

04:23.541 --> 04:24.791
He's headed towards you.

04:29.458 --> 04:30.750
Stone, walk away.

04:32.416 --> 04:34.125
- Walk away. Walk away--

04:34.625 --> 04:35.750
What are you doing?

04:37.250 --> 04:38.500
I've never played before.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.208
-  Sixteen.
- I'm sorry.

04:45.208 --> 04:47.041
You split your eights.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.875
Splitting your eights. Eighteen.

04:50.625 --> 04:51.458
Eighteen.

04:54.583 --> 04:55.708
<i>Dealer has 17.</i>

04:56.666 --> 04:58.125
- Ah, you win.
- You win it.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.791
Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead.

05:02.791 --> 05:04.416
- Thank you.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.291
<i>Nice job, Stone.</i>

05:08.291 --> 05:10.000
Not bad
for your first time out of the van.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.208
I think I just lost two years off my life.

05:12.708 --> 05:14.250
- Did it work?
<i>-</i> <i>Yeah, I'm in.</i>

05:14.250 --> 05:16.208
<i>Where the hell's Mulvaney?</i>

05:16.208 --> 05:18.791
Okay. Got him.
Through the kitchen, down the stairs.

05:18.791 --> 05:20.583
<i>Two heavies working the door.</i>

05:20.583 --> 05:21.500
On our way.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.833
Inserting you into facial recognition.

05:42.833 --> 05:43.708
Hello, beautiful.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.416
May I take this seat?

05:49.833 --> 05:51.291
Take it anywhere you like.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.208
Okay.

05:54.625 --> 05:55.458
Maybe later?

05:58.541 --> 06:00.000
Okay, you're all set.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.791
I'm almost afraid to see
what drew Mulvaney out of his hole.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.041
- Lads.
-  <i>Buona sera.</i>

06:16.666 --> 06:17.500
Okay.

06:20.708 --> 06:23.125
<i>We're now taking bets for the next game,</i>

06:23.125 --> 06:25.333
<i>which will begin in two minutes.</i>

06:25.333 --> 06:27.583
You were right
about Mulvaney's gambling habit.

06:28.208 --> 06:29.833
He never met a bet he didn't place.

06:30.416 --> 06:33.500
<i>You must predict the exact order of kills.</i>

06:33.500 --> 06:36.083
<i>Copy, Delta Kilo Six.
We have reported hostiles...</i>

06:36.083 --> 06:37.750
Those are military operations.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.666
They're wagering on body count.

06:42.666 --> 06:44.708
<i>With a bet
of four instant kills,</i>

06:44.708 --> 06:48.125
<i>this is a win for player number 46.</i>

06:48.750 --> 06:49.583
Betting on blood.

06:51.000 --> 06:51.916
<i>Yang, show me.</i>

06:54.333 --> 06:55.708
Just a bit to your right.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.500
Holy shit.

06:58.375 --> 07:01.041
That's US Navy Seals in real-time.

07:01.041 --> 07:03.583
And they've cracked
military-grade encryption.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.541
Who would have that capability?

07:06.583 --> 07:07.833
Enough tech talk.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.041
Target is Mulvaney.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.541
Okay, Dr. Yang. You have the floor.

07:13.541 --> 07:15.541
<i>Time to give Mulvaney his heart attack.</i>

07:16.458 --> 07:18.041
<i>I'll fire up the ambulance.</i>

07:37.833 --> 07:39.000
Mulvaney's exiting.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.583
You.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.166
Shit.

08:09.958 --> 08:12.333
I'll handle this guy.
You take Mulvaney.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.833
Stone.

08:16.833 --> 08:19.625
Mulvaney's on your right.
Another service corridor.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.708
Stand by to go dark.

08:28.791 --> 08:29.875
Shit.

08:37.291 --> 08:40.291
I've got Mulvaney.
Bailey, get us out of here. Fast.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.083
Showtime!

08:49.791 --> 08:51.416
All right. Okay. All right.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.291
<i>MI6, right?</i>

09:05.958 --> 09:08.250
You guys really need
to work on your subtlety.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.666
<i>You ruined my party.</i>

09:11.333 --> 09:13.666
<i>I should've listened
to the voices in my head.</i>

09:15.291 --> 09:17.750
"The British are coming.
The British are coming."

09:19.166 --> 09:20.750
Comms compromised.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.833
- No shit.
- Okay, okay. New plan.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.791
Exfil route Bravo. We have to go dark.

09:25.375 --> 09:27.000
Copy that. See you down there.

09:27.958 --> 09:28.791
Come on.

09:35.666 --> 09:37.250
Stone! Let's go.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.000
Hey!

09:42.000 --> 09:43.791
I'm not going anywhere.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.000
We're not done yet.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.500
More of Mulvaney's men.

10:13.666 --> 10:17.000
They're heading to the cable car station.
Parker's a sitting duck.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.625
We need to get down there now.

10:33.083 --> 10:36.000
- Stone!
- Go without me. I'll be fine.

10:36.916 --> 10:38.625
Stay put. We'll be back.

10:55.416 --> 10:58.625
Jack, this is Nine of Hearts.
Urgent forecast required.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.291
Nine, we have your position
and the full overview.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.541
Projecting forward now.

11:09.458 --> 11:12.208
The MI6 team
won't get down the mountain in time.

11:12.208 --> 11:15.083
The Heart gives
a 93 percent chance that Parker will die

11:15.083 --> 11:18.375
and Mulvaney will get away
unless the Charter intervenes.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.291
I'm gonna need a parachute.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.750
Okay.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.791
Fifty meters away,
over the handrail to your right.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.041
<i>And don't blow your cover.</i>

11:34.125 --> 11:34.958
On it.

11:42.083 --> 11:42.916
Oi!

11:54.208 --> 11:57.125
The Heart has
a chance of success at just 32 percent.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.000
Not helping, Jack.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:05.166 --> 12:08.125
Um... Stone, big drop coming up.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.583
<i>Big</i> drop.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.541
- How big?
<i>-</i> <i>The mother of big.</i>

12:12.708 --> 12:13.875
<i>Really, really big.</i>

12:22.458 --> 12:23.791
And we're in the game.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.333
Look, I've got money.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.083
More than you can imagine.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.416
It wouldn't be enough.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.875
Eight minutes out.
We're not gonna make it.

12:55.916 --> 12:59.250
Stone, Mulvaney's security
are arriving at the cable car station.

13:05.041 --> 13:08.416
Take the route to your left.
You need to pick up the pace.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.166
<i>The terrain's too flat,
and you're losing altitude.</i>

13:27.166 --> 13:30.083
If you cut across to the piste,
you can pick up a snow bike.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.333
Cables! Cables! Cables! Ca--

14:09.291 --> 14:11.166
Chance of success just plummeted.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.250
Only 'cause you've got no imagination.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.083
Oh, nice. Nice.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.500
Oh, you're joking!

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Come on!

14:37.458 --> 14:39.333
He can hold them off without us, right?

14:40.875 --> 14:41.708
Hold on!

14:50.375 --> 14:52.625
<i>You can get ahead of
the bikes at the next corner.</i>

15:05.416 --> 15:07.041
Hey. Are you okay?

15:10.958 --> 15:11.791
We meet again.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.291
Must be destiny.

15:15.541 --> 15:16.375
Must be.

15:19.291 --> 15:20.125
Hey.

15:22.916 --> 15:24.625
Hey! Hey!

16:09.708 --> 16:11.833
Stone, watch Bailey
and Yang to your right.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.208
The Charter's worked
too hard to embed you in MI6.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.166
We cannot risk your cover.

16:16.916 --> 16:17.875
Well aware, Jack.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.291
How many in the welcome party?

16:22.000 --> 16:22.916
Six of them.

16:22.916 --> 16:26.291
Four pistols, one shotgun, and a sniper

16:27.250 --> 16:29.041
with a very impressive record.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.583
Get out of the way!

16:50.041 --> 16:52.750
<i>Get away from them.
Take the path to your right.</i>

17:18.083 --> 17:19.958
<i>The sniper has opened fire on Parker.</i>

17:29.666 --> 17:30.875
Jack, give me a line.

17:51.541 --> 17:52.708
I got the lights.

18:01.041 --> 18:01.958
<i>Behind you!</i>

18:10.666 --> 18:13.041
<i>Chance of success to 85%.</i>

18:13.041 --> 18:14.250
Only 85%?

18:15.250 --> 18:16.458
Hardly seems fair.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.041
Uh... two more on your right.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.250
Look at that.

18:33.833 --> 18:36.458
Parker and target still very much alive.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.166
Great.

18:38.166 --> 18:41.000
Now, hide the bodies
and get out before MI6 sees you.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.333
Okay.

18:58.666 --> 18:59.666
What's happening?

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
- Yang.
- Hey.

19:12.875 --> 19:13.833
Where'd they go?

19:14.916 --> 19:15.916
Where'd who go?

19:16.708 --> 19:18.375
Mulvaney had an army of security.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.208
Got scared off by the sirens maybe?

19:21.208 --> 19:23.583
No point waiting to find out.
Let's just grab him and go.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.666
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! He's foaming.
- Shit.

19:34.458 --> 19:35.958
Bastard took cyanide.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.208
That's old school.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.333
Shit.

19:41.041 --> 19:42.958
Jesus. He's dead.

19:46.625 --> 19:49.875
Grab a leg. We have to get
back up the mountain for Stone.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.708
All right, genius. Now what?

19:57.708 --> 19:59.625

Genuine dog's breakfast.

21:44.041 --> 21:47.166
The Italians are livid,
as are Defense and Number 10.

21:47.166 --> 21:50.916
- I take full responsibility.
-  "I." That's your problem, Parker.

21:51.666 --> 21:52.875
Mulvaney's dead.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.458
Yang gave the wrong person a heart attack.

21:55.458 --> 21:58.916
And Stone, what the hell
were you thinking getting out of the van?

21:58.916 --> 22:01.791
- That was the only way she could get--
-  Put it in the report.

22:01.791 --> 22:04.958
Paperwork. Excellent.
That'll show Mulvaney's lads who's boss.

22:04.958 --> 22:05.875
Enough.

22:05.875 --> 22:09.208
Mulvaney's gone. And so is
any hope of using him as an asset.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.208
But now we have a new target.

22:11.916 --> 22:15.916
Someone broke through the highest levels
of military encryption, including our own.

22:15.916 --> 22:18.083
- Did you look into the girl?
-  The girl?

22:18.083 --> 22:21.041
Oh, yes. I'm afraid
we'll need more than that.

22:21.791 --> 22:24.166
We are trying to trace her,
but so far, we have nothing.

22:24.166 --> 22:26.333
- I'm happy to look--
-  We have people for that.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.416
Different people.

22:28.625 --> 22:31.333
You can all concentrate
on your admin. Sandra.

22:34.833 --> 22:36.000
Cheers, Sandra.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.333
Thanks, Sandra.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.416
Love you, Sandra.

22:42.541 --> 22:43.666
To Stone.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.166
- First time out of the van.
-  Hey!

22:46.166 --> 22:49.250
-  And she didn't blow the op--
-  No, we did that all on our own.

22:49.250 --> 22:52.500
Too bad. Been on a good winning streak
since Stone joined us.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.916
Thought you might be our lucky charm.
But you did win at blackjack.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.958
And I'm never gambling again
or stepping out of the van.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.291
What'd you do when I left you up there?

23:03.291 --> 23:05.708
Hid in the toilets.

23:07.791 --> 23:10.250
- What? You said to stay out of sight.
- True.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.958
All right. Leave her alone.

23:12.791 --> 23:14.833
We got more important things to discuss.

23:14.833 --> 23:16.291
Like, the girl.

23:17.166 --> 23:19.458
But let's be honest.
We already know who she works for.

23:19.458 --> 23:23.125
-  God.
- That's right. The Charter.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.000
- Strap yourselves in.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.500
Whatever. I just identified
another one of their ops.

23:29.291 --> 23:33.041
They took out a terror cell who hijacked
an oil tanker in the Panama Canal.

23:33.541 --> 23:35.708
Yeah, but who would have
that kind of power?

23:36.291 --> 23:37.125
Hm.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.458
- I'm doing it again, aren't I?
- Yeah.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.125
Okay, fine, mock me.

23:41.125 --> 23:42.291
But it's true.

23:42.291 --> 23:46.083
Ex-intelligence operatives
answering only to themselves.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.666
No national allegiances,
no political leanings.

23:48.666 --> 23:52.125
Putting out fires their governments
never allowed them to. That's...

23:53.083 --> 23:54.333
That's the Charter.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.500
The most highly trained agents

23:56.500 --> 23:59.666
working together to keep peace
in a turbulent world.

23:59.666 --> 24:02.166
No. That is a Saturday morning cartoon.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.791
Nobody knows about
the Charter because they don't exist.

24:05.750 --> 24:06.791
Pass me the vinegar.

24:07.791 --> 24:09.041
- And this girl.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.541
This girl is part of it, and you know it.

24:12.666 --> 24:15.000
Okay, don't judge me.
I'm gonna go with this for a sec.

24:15.666 --> 24:18.458
- If the Charter are such do-gooders...
- Mm.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.041
...why'd the girl interrupt our mission?

24:20.041 --> 24:20.958
Oh. Oh!

24:21.916 --> 24:23.583
That's a good question. Yep.

24:23.583 --> 24:28.083
Sorry, Bailey, there is no secret genius
organization pulling all the strings.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.875
It's just us, Sandra, and her paperwork.

24:32.333 --> 24:35.541
But it was a nice bedtime story.
Speaking of which...

24:36.416 --> 24:37.458
Already?

24:37.458 --> 24:40.875
- Jet lag.
- Um, there's a one-hour time difference.

24:41.750 --> 24:42.583
Night, guys.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.166
- Night.
- Night.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.125
Right in the eye.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.958
- I drive with that eye.
- Might make you a better driver.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.833
Can't make you worse.

24:55.833 --> 24:58.291
- Kidding. I take it back.
-  No.

26:11.791 --> 26:12.875
Sneaking up on me?

26:13.791 --> 26:15.708
A field agent
should be ready for anything.

26:18.083 --> 26:21.166
You were saying?
I never should have told you I swim.

26:21.666 --> 26:22.875
A weak moment.

26:23.708 --> 26:24.541
I liked it.

26:26.083 --> 26:28.083
So... the girl.

26:28.916 --> 26:29.875
What news?

26:30.583 --> 26:33.250
No news. We were told not to look.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.000
You're a terrible liar.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.250
Look, if we leave it
to the pen-pushers at MI6,

26:38.250 --> 26:40.583
she'll hack the entire world
before we even get a name.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.250
I should've gone beyond the mission
and brought her in.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.875
Well, your hands were pretty full
at the time.

26:46.375 --> 26:48.375
And besides, it wasn't our objective.

26:49.416 --> 26:51.916
Why don't you try and live a little?
Could be fun.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.333
What happened to
"Don't get out of the van, Rachel"?

26:55.333 --> 26:56.250
Ah.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.250
- This is different.
- Hm.

26:59.333 --> 27:02.000
So, rules are rules
unless they apply to you.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.750
Why do I feel like you know me better
than I know you?

27:05.250 --> 27:07.791
Maybe I should listen to one of these
dreary podcasts of yours.

27:07.791 --> 27:10.666
<i>- ♪ Don't stop thinking about tomorrow</i>... <i>♪
-</i> Ah.

27:10.666 --> 27:11.958
Bailey got to you, huh?

27:12.458 --> 27:14.958
Mock our music,
and I won't tell you my theory.

27:14.958 --> 27:16.166
My lips are sealed.

27:23.916 --> 27:25.958
She's new to the scene. Has to be.

27:26.541 --> 27:28.625
Otherwise, we would have heard about her.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.666
To get a guest list like that--

27:30.666 --> 27:33.375
She's working with someone else.
A veteran. But who?

27:34.208 --> 27:36.083
We'll make a list. I'll bring snacks.

27:37.916 --> 27:41.541
I, uh, I'm sorry.
I already have... a brunch date.

27:43.375 --> 27:44.375
Can I come?

27:46.708 --> 27:47.666
Bye, Parker.

28:11.833 --> 28:13.458
Ivo? It's been a while.

28:14.166 --> 28:16.416
Nine of Hearts, it's good to see you.

28:16.416 --> 28:19.291
- How's it going?
- It's been busy. This way.

28:20.333 --> 28:23.916
The Charter has been dealing with
three actionable threats this morning.

28:23.916 --> 28:26.375
Potential sarin gas attack in Paris.

28:26.375 --> 28:30.916
The Heart predicted the time and location
of the attack with 87% certainty.

28:30.916 --> 28:32.833
Eight of Hearts is on site now.

28:33.333 --> 28:36.291
Six is defusing
a potential international incident

28:36.291 --> 28:37.750
in the South China Sea.

28:38.541 --> 28:43.000
And Diamonds team's handling hackers
targeting the North American power grid.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.416
That, um... That's the peacock.

28:47.416 --> 28:49.000
- Hi.
- Came with the house.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.333
-  Hey, Jack.

28:52.333 --> 28:53.625
Enjoying your new office?

28:53.625 --> 28:55.958
We can't all be
gallivanting around the Alps.

28:56.458 --> 28:59.458
How's King of Hearts? Is she angry?

28:59.458 --> 29:00.666
Have you seen her yet?

29:00.666 --> 29:04.291
Well, let's see. You lost control
of the situation, target is dead,

29:04.291 --> 29:05.916
then you had to kill six men.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.208
What a glorious outcome.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.416
- Victoria Crosses all around.
-  Morning, Nomad.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.625
Good to see you too.
Love what you've done with the place.

29:15.125 --> 29:16.833
Is she developing a sense of humor?

29:17.500 --> 29:19.500
- Did you find the girl?
- Of course.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.166
Keya Dhawan.

29:23.083 --> 29:26.083
She is from Pune in the west of India.

29:26.708 --> 29:27.791
Orphaned at eight.

29:28.916 --> 29:30.458
How'd she learn to program?

29:30.458 --> 29:32.208
Ever heard of Niam Kharche?

29:32.208 --> 29:34.750
Billionaire investor, pharmaceuticals.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.250
Had business in Pune.

29:36.250 --> 29:39.333
Ran IT workshops for kids
in underprivileged communities.

29:41.125 --> 29:43.583
He spotted her
in one of these programs.

29:43.583 --> 29:47.333
Yeah. He saw she was a prodigy,
took her under his wing, trained her up,

29:47.833 --> 29:49.833
and then they had a falling out.

29:49.833 --> 29:50.750
Why?

29:51.250 --> 29:53.000
The Heart's better at whats than whys.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.958
And the what is,
she split from Kharche and disappeared.

29:59.083 --> 30:00.166
She's 22 now.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.458
Not much older than when we met.

30:02.458 --> 30:05.333
Yes, but she fell in with
a bunch of criminal lowlifes.

30:05.333 --> 30:07.250
Some people get all the luck.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.083
We think that Keya
set up the casino of blood.

30:12.583 --> 30:15.916
She knew about Mulvaney's
gambling habit and used it to lure him in.

30:15.916 --> 30:16.833
Why?

30:18.125 --> 30:22.291
Mulvaney had become
obsessed with a new weapon, a myth.

30:22.291 --> 30:26.875
A quantum computer sophisticated enough
to hack into anything, anywhere.

30:28.000 --> 30:28.833
The Heart.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.416
So, where is she now?

30:41.083 --> 30:43.291
The Heart predicts with 96% certainty

30:43.291 --> 30:46.291
that Keya is heading to Lisbon
for the opening of Club Moritz.

30:46.791 --> 30:49.291
So, we will leak her location to MI6.

30:49.291 --> 30:52.875
Then we should have your operation
back up and running within 24 hours.

30:53.375 --> 30:54.625
It doesn't feel right.

30:56.333 --> 30:59.375
Keya chose to hack into
our comms feed on the mountain.

30:59.375 --> 31:01.916
She revealed herself to me,
looked me straight in the eye.

31:01.916 --> 31:04.583
I'm not sure
if we should ignore the Heart,

31:04.583 --> 31:07.333
the closest mankind
has to perfect intelligence,

31:07.333 --> 31:09.166
because of eye contact in a bar.

31:09.166 --> 31:10.916
This might be why you're single, Jack.

31:11.833 --> 31:13.250
Just follow the numbers.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.500
Your mission is Lisbon.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.500
And if she's not there?

31:17.500 --> 31:18.500
Eat tapas.

31:19.541 --> 31:21.041
Just not with your MI6 team.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.125
So, you're spying on <i>me</i> now.

31:27.916 --> 31:29.458
I'm tracking my asset.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.541
You know what you signed up for.

31:35.125 --> 31:37.041
No relationships. No friends.

31:37.041 --> 31:39.208
No poolside tête-à-tête.

31:40.833 --> 31:43.291
What we do is too important.

31:43.291 --> 31:46.916
When governments fail,
the only thing left is the Charter.

31:47.416 --> 31:49.791
I'm undercover. This is just part of it.

31:51.125 --> 31:53.250
- Everything's under control.
- Good.

31:54.625 --> 31:55.625
Keep it that way.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.125
Your target is Dhawan.

32:17.708 --> 32:19.916
Come on, Keya. Take the bait.

32:47.125 --> 32:47.958
Smile.

33:35.833 --> 33:36.750
Hey, Bailey.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.958
<i>Hey.
We got a lead on hacker girl.</i>

33:38.958 --> 33:40.166
<i>We're going to Lisbon.</i>

33:41.000 --> 33:42.541
Better call the cat sitter.

33:43.041 --> 33:44.958
Oh no, no. Barry's all right. He's--

33:45.583 --> 33:47.583
I told him, no parties.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.916
<i>Okay. Sweet dreams.</i>

33:52.125 --> 33:53.250
<i>Wheels up at eight.</i>

33:54.000 --> 33:54.833
Got it.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.708
- Night, Bailey.
<i>- Night.</i>

34:05.416 --> 34:07.250
<i>What about this?</i>

34:07.250 --> 34:10.416
<i>Ah Jesus. Just when we thought
it couldn't get worse.</i>

34:11.541 --> 34:14.458
-  <i>Are you singing?
-</i> <i>I'm clearing my throat.</i>

34:14.458 --> 34:15.500
Tune.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.208
-  <i>Look at that.</i>
-  <i>No.</i>

34:17.208 --> 34:18.416
<i>Voice of an angel.</i>

34:21.833 --> 34:25.375
<i>♪ You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say ♪</i>

34:26.625 --> 34:28.208
<i>♪ I'll speak a little louder ♪</i>

34:28.208 --> 34:29.541
<i>♪ I'll even shout ♪</i>

34:30.541 --> 34:33.875
<i>♪ You know that I'm proud

34:54.791 --> 34:57.500
Bailey, you should meet my gran.
She has the same taste in music,

34:57.500 --> 34:58.958
and you have the same hair.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.291
It's my van, my tunes.

35:03.291 --> 35:04.833
Yeah, that's what she says.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.791
-  Oh, sorry.
-  Whoa.

35:12.791 --> 35:15.416
Little harder next time.
I didn't quite crack a tooth.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.250
You okay back there?

35:20.500 --> 35:22.041
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...

35:22.541 --> 35:23.916
-  Carsick.
- Mm.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.625
Come on, swap seats with me.

35:29.416 --> 35:32.333
- What? No, no, no. It's fine.
- Come on. No, it's fine. Move.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.583
- Okay.

35:39.916 --> 35:41.250
-  Jesus!
-  Seatbelt.

35:41.250 --> 35:42.208
Bailey!

35:42.208 --> 35:44.291
Aren't you supposed to be an elite driver?

35:44.291 --> 35:45.583
Sorry.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.041
-  Okay?
- Yeah.

36:07.375 --> 36:08.958
How long till the club opens?

36:08.958 --> 36:10.916
We head out in a couple of hours.

36:20.958 --> 36:21.791
Hey, Stone.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.791
Sent you something. Check it out.

36:29.125 --> 36:31.375
- What is this?
- It's for my niece's birthday.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.375
What do you think? Female perspective?

36:35.375 --> 36:37.541
It's very pink.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.583
Parker, this music is ancient.

37:01.583 --> 37:04.708
- What are you, a hundred years old?
- It's called culture.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.416
Yeah. Sorry, Parker, I'm with Yang. Yang!

37:13.875 --> 37:14.708
Yes!

37:16.166 --> 37:17.916
- Woo!
- Oh, okay.

37:18.583 --> 37:19.833
Now we're talking.

37:22.541 --> 37:23.833
Woo!

37:23.833 --> 37:26.125
Oh, come on, Bailey. You know you want to.

Yes, I do.

38:05.791 --> 38:07.000
Woo!

38:07.583 --> 38:09.375
- She's smiling.
-  Oh yeah!

38:22.625 --> 38:24.666
<i>Six hostiles entering the building...</i>

38:25.166 --> 38:26.166
Nine, I have you.

38:27.166 --> 38:29.958
Six hostiles moving up the stairs.
More outside.

38:29.958 --> 38:32.583
They'll breach the doorway in four...

38:33.708 --> 38:34.708
<i>three...</i>

38:35.875 --> 38:36.708
<i>two...</i>

38:37.791 --> 38:38.625
<i>one.</i>

38:52.041 --> 38:53.000
Parker.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.166
We're gonna get you out.

39:26.458 --> 39:27.875
Stone, go now!

39:36.958 --> 39:38.541
Nine, the window.

39:39.541 --> 39:40.541
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

39:46.833 --> 39:47.875
<i>Stone, you will die.</i>

39:58.208 --> 39:59.583
Jack, I need your help.

40:00.416 --> 40:02.791
Plotting exit routes... now.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.000
Come on. Parker, come on. Come on!

40:21.458 --> 40:22.666
I'm going back in.

40:22.666 --> 40:24.208
What? No.

40:24.208 --> 40:25.875
<i>Saving them is not your mission.</i>

40:25.875 --> 40:27.625
<i>- Get out of there.</i>
- Jack, please.

40:27.625 --> 40:30.208
No. At best, you break cover.
Most likely, you die.

40:36.000 --> 40:36.916
Stone?

40:38.375 --> 40:39.208
Stone?

40:39.791 --> 40:40.625
Stone!

42:07.083 --> 42:08.416
- Holy shit.
- Come on.

42:09.750 --> 42:10.666
Time to go.

42:11.250 --> 42:12.791
There'll be more. Come on.

42:27.500 --> 42:29.500
Van's a no-go. Go, go.

42:51.416 --> 42:52.750
Does that thing ever work?

42:52.750 --> 42:54.125
Yeah, yeah. It works.

42:54.125 --> 42:55.416
Just not on every car.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.500
There. Move!

43:17.833 --> 43:19.333
Stone. Now would be good.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.375
Move over. I've got this.

43:32.958 --> 43:35.625
- Away from the guns, Stone. Away!
- Just a second.

43:43.958 --> 43:45.000
Down! Down! Down!

44:09.125 --> 44:10.541
Go! Go, go, go, go!

44:17.208 --> 44:19.166
Okay, Stone. Time to start talking.

44:19.166 --> 44:23.041
You hack, you fight, and you drive.
Parker, are you getting this?

44:26.000 --> 44:29.166
- Three vehicles. Lots of guns.
- Yeah, I can tell by the bullets.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.625
- Stone!
- Sort of in the middle of something.

44:45.625 --> 44:46.458
Whoa!

44:48.000 --> 44:49.458
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

44:50.791 --> 44:52.000
Whoa!

44:53.208 --> 44:54.833
Oh, okay. Okay, you got it.

45:04.125 --> 45:05.125
Yang.

45:06.250 --> 45:08.083
- Got it.
- On your three o'clock.

45:08.625 --> 45:10.958
In three, two, one.

45:31.833 --> 45:32.666
Clip's out.

45:52.333 --> 45:55.500
- Are you trying to kill us?
- Pretty much the opposite, actually.

46:03.375 --> 46:06.125
Okay. This might be kind of intense.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.458
Oh, this isn't good.

46:52.416 --> 46:54.333
- Stone, they're still coming.
- I know.

46:57.625 --> 46:58.833
Hold on.

47:33.916 --> 47:37.791
Well, I can't speak for the others,
but I... I think you're ready for the field.

47:49.625 --> 47:51.875
We need to get off the road
and lose this van.

48:18.333 --> 48:19.166
Rachel.

48:19.958 --> 48:20.791
Rachel.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.125
Stone.

48:28.375 --> 48:29.458
Who the hell are you?

48:35.041 --> 48:35.916
It's complicated.

48:35.916 --> 48:38.041
- From where I'm sitting,

48:38.041 --> 48:40.750
a baby agent from IT
just took out an entire kill team.

48:41.333 --> 48:44.333
- Bailey, what's taking you so long?
- Shit.

48:44.916 --> 48:47.500
The Charter?
You're the... you're the bloody Charter?

48:48.166 --> 48:50.708
What, are you trying to
bring in Dhawan yourself?

48:51.208 --> 48:52.833
Are you working with her?

48:55.916 --> 48:56.750
Answer him.

48:58.125 --> 48:59.083
You owe us that.

49:01.291 --> 49:02.458
We're after her too.

49:02.958 --> 49:04.250
Oh my God.

49:06.291 --> 49:07.333
The Charter's real.

49:08.500 --> 49:09.666
And you're one of them.

49:10.166 --> 49:12.166
I wish I could've told you more.

49:13.041 --> 49:14.625
But we all want the same thing.

49:15.583 --> 49:16.416
No, we don't.

49:22.416 --> 49:24.500
You're not the only one with a secret.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.833
Did they mean something to you?

49:33.375 --> 49:36.333
Oh, come on, Rachel.
You're only playing a part, right?

49:38.458 --> 49:39.750
Who are you, Parker?

49:41.125 --> 49:42.291
Why don't you ask the Heart?

49:46.125 --> 49:48.833
If you wanted me dead,
you would have shot me first.

49:49.625 --> 49:51.833
Still a few things I need to know.

49:52.333 --> 49:54.708
About you, the Charter.

49:55.625 --> 49:56.958
But perhaps most of all,

49:58.000 --> 49:59.666
I was looking forward to a fight.

50:10.541 --> 50:11.791
- Talk.

50:17.625 --> 50:20.666
Keya and I learned
that the Charter infiltrated MI6.

50:22.166 --> 50:23.625
I had to flush out who.

50:24.250 --> 50:26.166
At first, I thought it was Yang,

50:26.958 --> 50:28.750
but I was so pleased it was you.

50:29.958 --> 50:31.291
Keya's working for you?

50:34.708 --> 50:36.208
Your hand's shaking.

50:38.166 --> 50:39.458
You barely nicked me.

50:40.041 --> 50:41.166
That was the point.

50:41.958 --> 50:42.791
Poison-tipped.

50:43.791 --> 50:46.416
A little basic, I know,
but it hits the spot.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.833
Looks like the paralysis is kicking in.

50:51.958 --> 50:54.666
I spent six years
looking for you people, Stone.

50:55.458 --> 50:57.583
Then fate brings you straight to me.

50:58.458 --> 50:59.791
You're a very good agent.

51:00.833 --> 51:04.833
But you were so busy letting a machine
think for you that you missed me.

51:06.500 --> 51:07.333
Right here,

51:08.208 --> 51:09.541
in front of your face...

51:11.791 --> 51:12.708
the whole time.

51:16.375 --> 51:17.791
And Mulvaney?

51:18.666 --> 51:19.500
Oh...

51:20.333 --> 51:22.000
Well, he was tech-averse like me.

51:22.916 --> 51:24.333
Kept everything up here.

51:25.416 --> 51:29.416
So, Keya and I set up
our casino of blood to lure him in.

51:31.083 --> 51:33.458
We needed to have a little chat
about the Heart.

51:33.458 --> 51:34.958
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

51:37.083 --> 51:38.166
Talk.

51:38.166 --> 51:39.083
Yeah, I--

51:40.541 --> 51:43.625
<i>The Heart is
what gives the Charter its power.</i>

51:44.125 --> 51:47.333
<i>It's the most formidable weapon
you never knew existed.</i>

51:47.833 --> 51:49.875
<i>It can hack into anything, anywhere.</i>

51:50.833 --> 51:55.458
<i>Cell phones, power grids, the banks,
governments, military, health records.</i>

51:56.583 --> 51:57.750
<i>Your secrets.</i>

51:58.583 --> 52:01.083
<i>It knows you
better than you know yourself.</i>

52:01.708 --> 52:02.750
<i>It's determinism.</i>

52:04.041 --> 52:07.708
<i>With access to trillions of data points
at once, its modeling is so accurate</i>

52:07.708 --> 52:09.250
<i>it can predict the future.</i>

52:11.000 --> 52:13.166
<i>The Heart is knowledge and power.</i>

52:14.333 --> 52:17.416
<i>It can crash a market
or drop a plane out of the sky.</i>

52:18.166 --> 52:22.125
<i>Who needs to steal a nuclear bomb
when you can control them all?</i>

52:23.625 --> 52:24.875
<i>If you own the Heart...</i>

52:26.750 --> 52:27.833
<i>you own the world.</i>

52:34.750 --> 52:35.583
Where is it?

52:37.625 --> 52:39.833
Where... is it?

52:42.208 --> 52:44.291
Only a Charter member could tell you.

52:46.250 --> 52:48.458
The poison's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

52:49.916 --> 52:51.166
Cold War paralytic.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
My chemist does all the classics.

52:55.416 --> 52:56.625
Like cyanide.

53:08.208 --> 53:09.458
Oh, relax, Rachel.

53:10.791 --> 53:15.041
Killing you is not part of the plan.
We need you to deliver a package first.

53:18.666 --> 53:21.458
- I've loved working with you, Rachel.

53:22.458 --> 53:23.291
Hand on heart.

54:17.958 --> 54:18.791
Stone?

54:21.375 --> 54:22.208
Stone?

54:22.708 --> 54:24.625
She's awake. She's awake.

54:27.833 --> 54:30.375
Hold her here. Hold her down.

54:32.333 --> 54:33.250
Oh shit.

54:36.208 --> 54:38.625
- Take this. Help me. Help me here.

54:39.541 --> 54:40.583
Keep her steady.

54:41.541 --> 54:43.916
Cholinest-- Cholines--

54:43.916 --> 54:46.083
Wait. Get me atropine. Five mils.

54:46.083 --> 54:47.708
It's cholinesterase.

54:47.708 --> 54:48.958
Jack. Jack.

54:48.958 --> 54:51.125
-  We've been breached.
- How?

54:51.791 --> 54:54.916
It's... There's a Trojan
in our system delivered wirelessly.

54:54.916 --> 54:56.791
Chewing through security
like it isn't there.

54:56.791 --> 54:57.875
Restrict all access.

54:57.875 --> 55:01.000
Nomad, I've tried. No-go.
They're trying to access the Heart.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.333
From where? We're walled off.

55:06.500 --> 55:08.791
It's a weak wireless signal.
It's coming from...

55:10.791 --> 55:11.958
inside the building.

55:13.458 --> 55:14.333
Stone.

55:14.333 --> 55:16.375
Quickly.
We need to monitor her airway.

55:17.291 --> 55:19.166
-  Go ahead.
-  Hold her.

55:19.750 --> 55:20.791
Press down.

55:22.166 --> 55:23.083
That didn't do it.

55:33.791 --> 55:36.083
- Stone.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.333
What's happened?
I need to know what's happened.

55:40.416 --> 55:41.875
How long were we compromised?

55:42.375 --> 55:45.166
Three minutes and 45 seconds.
Running a system check now.

55:45.166 --> 55:47.625
We need to know what they accessed.
Is the Locker safe?

55:47.625 --> 55:48.916
Boom.

55:48.916 --> 55:50.583
The Locker is still flying high

55:50.583 --> 55:53.083
with the Heart safe inside,
85,000 feet up.

55:54.041 --> 55:56.000
No one's getting up there
without a space shuttle.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.625
It's passing over the Atlantic,
towards West Africa.

55:58.625 --> 56:01.083
And the other suits,
can they still access the Heart?

56:01.083 --> 56:04.041
- Looks like it-- Jesus.
- What?

56:04.041 --> 56:06.791
There've been
100,000 attempts to access files.

56:06.791 --> 56:10.208
Clubs team are analyzing the data,
but looks like our security held.

56:10.208 --> 56:12.083
We need to shut it all down now.

56:12.916 --> 56:16.250
- Shut what down? The Heart?
- Until we know what they've done.

56:16.750 --> 56:18.833
We have no idea what they're capable of.

56:18.833 --> 56:21.458
Don't need to shut it down
to find out what they've done.

56:21.458 --> 56:24.208
- We'd be harming ourselves.
- We don't know. She's not stupid.

56:24.208 --> 56:26.875
- And neither are we.
- Sure about that? Because right now--

56:26.875 --> 56:28.666
Rachel. Rachel. He's right.

56:28.666 --> 56:29.625
We'll sort it.

56:30.375 --> 56:31.208
"We"?

56:32.125 --> 56:34.208
A word in private. Now.

56:44.041 --> 56:47.291
I told you. I knew Keya
was playing us, playing the Heart.

56:47.291 --> 56:49.500
No, you didn't. No, you didn't
You had a feeling.

56:49.500 --> 56:52.500
Nothing... nothing concrete,
nothing actionable.

56:52.500 --> 56:55.541
A mood, a notion, a hunch, a bollocks.
We don't trade in those.

56:55.541 --> 56:56.958
I knew she wouldn't be there.

56:56.958 --> 56:59.375
You ignored the Heart,
and you went back in.

56:59.375 --> 57:01.333
- To save my team.
- They weren't your team.

57:01.333 --> 57:03.750
They died anyway.
You going back made sure of that.

57:06.833 --> 57:08.041
You blew your cover.

57:09.208 --> 57:11.916
If you'd left when we told you to,
Parker would've followed you,

57:11.916 --> 57:14.375
we'd have caught him,
and Yang and Bailey might be alive.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.625
- I should've just listened to the Heart?
- Yes.

57:27.625 --> 57:29.958
The Charter exists for one reason.

57:31.166 --> 57:34.458
To maximize lives saved.
That's the only moral metric there is.

57:34.458 --> 57:38.291
And it's a calculation.
A pure and objective calculation.

57:38.291 --> 57:39.958
Made for us by a machine.

57:39.958 --> 57:42.125
Have you forgotten how radical that is?

57:44.083 --> 57:47.708
It doesn't mean
that what we do is easy or feels nice.

57:47.708 --> 57:50.791
You'll have the voices of those people
in your head for the rest of your life.

57:50.791 --> 57:54.541
And you will never
not feel responsible for them ever.

57:55.916 --> 57:58.166
But the end justifies the means.

58:01.333 --> 58:04.708
I spent every day with Parker
for a year and didn't see it coming.

58:06.458 --> 58:07.291
No.

58:08.291 --> 58:09.416
Neither did the Heart.

58:13.458 --> 58:14.791
So, what do we do now?

58:14.791 --> 58:16.708
I'm...

58:19.958 --> 58:22.791
Gonna make some tough choices,
and this is the first one.

58:23.291 --> 58:25.166
I'm standing you down, Rachel.

58:25.958 --> 58:27.541
Go home. Get some rest.

58:27.541 --> 58:29.875
Keep your head down.
Don't do anything stupid.

58:31.833 --> 58:32.916
You can't do this.

58:32.916 --> 58:34.125
You're compromised.

58:35.208 --> 58:36.875
Parker knows you. Dhawan knows you.

58:36.875 --> 58:40.750
And the other Kings, quite rightly...
don't know if you can be trusted.

58:41.375 --> 58:42.208
And you?

58:44.708 --> 58:48.375
I want to protect what we've spent
20 years trying to build.

58:51.166 --> 58:52.208
So, I'm just out.

58:54.458 --> 58:55.875
It's about the greater good.

58:57.500 --> 58:58.625
It's nothing personal.

58:59.125 --> 58:59.958
No.

59:01.375 --> 59:02.875
I'm starting to see that.

59:33.083 --> 59:34.000
Hello?

59:34.500 --> 59:36.500
- Stone? Wrong number. Wait.
- It's for me.

59:38.041 --> 59:39.041
That's my phone. I--

59:39.541 --> 59:43.250
<i>So, why is a Charter agent
riding around all alone</i>,

59:43.250 --> 59:45.125
<i>just hours after being poisoned?</i>

59:45.125 --> 59:48.666
Doesn't feel like they're taking care of
their most valuable player.

59:48.666 --> 59:49.750
What do you want?

59:50.333 --> 59:51.666
<i>Don't be a sore loser.</i>

59:51.666 --> 59:55.333
<i>I bet you used to think we were so alike.
Now you know I'm better.</i>

59:55.333 --> 59:58.125
Better? You killed my friends.

59:59.333 --> 01:00:00.166
What?

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.250
<i>You didn't know, huh?</i>

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.958
Well, I told you this wasn't a game, Keya.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:06.958
Heart or no Heart,

01:00:08.166 --> 01:00:09.333
I'm coming for you.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.250
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:25.666
Nomad. Great spot.

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:36.125
All four kings in the same room.
How long has it been, three years?

01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.041
Not long enough.

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:43.583
So, who is this Parker,
and how did we miss him?

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.083
Career intelligence agent.
Born in Belfast, lives alone.

01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:51.708
He has no one he cares for.
There's nothing much to live for.

01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:56.750
He has devoted his life
to a country that sees him as expendable.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.833
Okay. We get it.
All that is fuel for the fire.

01:00:59.833 --> 01:01:03.625
- But it won't burn without a spark.
-  I was getting to that.

01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:08.875
I had to lean extremely hard on
some very old friends for this.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.750
Chechnya, December 2015.

01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:14.875
What's this?

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:19.083
It was before your time.
Before the Heart, for that matter.

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:24.291
A Chechen warlord was given free rein
by the Chechen and Russian governments.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The West, as always, were
looking the other way.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.041
He was wiping out whole villages,
trying to stamp out dissent.

01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:35.333
But... what's this got to do with Parker?

01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:37.291
He was there.

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:44.125
Different identity. No electronic records.

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:47.000
But he was there, with MI6,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
delivering weapons
to take the warlord out.

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:54.250
Any sign of them?

01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:57.416
You got an ETA yet?

01:01:57.416 --> 01:01:58.458
They'll be here.

01:02:06.333 --> 01:02:07.916
We intercepted a communication.

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:09.958
It was a trap.

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:21.916
Intelligence came through from MI6
that their entire team had been executed.

01:02:21.916 --> 01:02:23.791
We thought there was no one left to save.

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:28.333
The region was a tinderbox
on the verge of full civil war.

01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:31.500
We couldn't let those weapons
fall into the warlord's hands.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.833
It would have cost thousands of lives.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.416
We had a drone that was stationed
overhead armed with missiles.

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.333
I gave the order myself.

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:59.458
We made it look like a rebel force
had ordered the drone strike.

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.875
MI6 buried their mistake.

01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:04.791
No report, no investigation.

01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:08.916
No record of the personnel
who had been involved.

01:03:09.708 --> 01:03:11.416
We thought everyone had died.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.041
Until a few hours ago.

01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:18.000
What a mess.

01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:23.958
So, you think... he knows it was us?

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:26.708
I think that's a safe assumption.

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:32.041
And now he wants to destroy the Charter.

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.541
You killed Bailey and Yang?

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:42.625
That wasn't the plan.

01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:45.875
You stick to the tech
and leave strategy to me, okay?

01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:50.125
Let me remind you, we're partners. Okay?
So if you want me to do my job,

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:52.916
you have to tell me
what you're doing before you do it.

01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.458
Let me remind you,
the Charter don't give two shits

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:57.250
about people like Bailey and Yang.

01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.875
So, if you want us to succeed,
you shouldn't either.

01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:56.833
Hey, Barry.

01:04:57.583 --> 01:04:59.375
I'm a friend of your dad's.

01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:03.875
It's okay.

01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:15.750
I've got you.

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:48.041
The camera.

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:56.041
She hacked into the camera feed.

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.208
Let's see how well she covered her tracks.

01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:19.125
There she is.

01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:21.791
What's in the desert, Keya?

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:24.833
I'm guessing it's not the nightlife.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.750
Are you shitting me?

01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:32.208
West Africa. The Locker.

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:37.583
 You ever done this before?
Choppered in at over 40,000 feet?

01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:40.041
Trick question. No one has.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:43.708
But my mama always said
I could do anything.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.958
How long do we have
before the Locker descends?

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:47.750
Eleven hours and seven minutes.

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:51.291
At which point,
the Charter will realize what's going on.

01:06:51.291 --> 01:06:55.583
It'll take nine minutes and 26 seconds
for the Locker to drop to 40,000 feet.

01:06:55.583 --> 01:06:58.250
We'll have about eight minutes
to get in, take the Heart,

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.125
and get out again
before they regain control.

01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:01.250
Very precise.

01:07:02.375 --> 01:07:03.208
You're sure?

01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:05.791
No. I'll be sure when it descends.

01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:10.083
If they found my code, it won't descend,
they'll be waiting for us, and we all die.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.166
- Hey.
- Good morning.

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:20.166
What time is it?

01:07:20.666 --> 01:07:22.250
Uh, it's nearly seven.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.375
What? Oh shit.

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:24.708
Any luck?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:28.083
Uh... nothing. But they need to
pop their heads up at some point.

01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:30.000
- I'll see if they--

01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:37.291
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:40.208
Get Nomad now! Get Nomad now!

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.541
Just get me up there. I'll do the rest.

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:50.666
Nomad will string me up for this.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.083
Tell her I stole your keys.

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:56.583
You'll just have to trust me.

01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:03.916
Okay. Moment of truth.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.125
How will we know if it's worked?

01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:10.875
Would you look at that?

01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:21.583
The Locker has been dropped
15,000 feet in the last two minutes.

01:08:21.583 --> 01:08:22.666
Still descending.

01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:25.708
Security systems are all down.
I'm locked out.

01:08:26.208 --> 01:08:29.791
- How is that even possible? Another hack?
- No. No.

01:08:29.791 --> 01:08:32.083
This is why they did it the first time.

01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:34.416
It's been lying dormant
in our system until now.

01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:35.958
- Can you override it?
- I'm trying.

01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:07.541
The air lock's been breached.

01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:09.750
Contact every Charter agent in the region.

01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.541
There's no one within 500 miles.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.083
<i>Approaching coordinates
in five, four, three--</i>

01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:23.375
<i>- I hope you know what you're doing.</i>
-  Tell me about it.

01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:42.500
- We have a something approaching fast.
-  A something?

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.333
-  Thirty seconds out.
- What is it?

01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:50.250
I think-- I think it's a someone.

01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:53.000
Who is it?

01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:55.416
Go in closer.

01:10:00.416 --> 01:10:01.333
Is that--?

01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:03.291
It's Stone.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:17.208
I have to descend. Lower the rotor speed.

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:19.916
<i>Copy that.
See you in seven minutes.</i>

01:10:30.583 --> 01:10:32.208
She's not gonna make it.

01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:44.875
- Woo!

01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:52.083
Look who it is.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:54.583
- I'm gonna need a minute.
- No!

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:57.750
The ship's lining is filled with hydrogen.
One spark, and we're all dead.

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.000
No way to get hold of her.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.041
Come on, Rachel.

01:11:25.541 --> 01:11:26.625
Come on.

01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:52.041
It's over, Keya.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:56.083
For who?

01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:04.291
I told you not to get out of the van.

01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:06.541
You also told me to have some fun.

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:46.541
It's gone.

01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:53.708
And now you answer to me.

01:12:55.708 --> 01:12:56.958
We've lost the Heart.

01:13:01.583 --> 01:13:02.416
Not yet.

01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:21.041
Parker. Ninety seconds. Let's go.

01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:25.166
Shame about your parachute.
You'll be needing that.

01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:49.291
-  Get off me!

01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:54.875
No, no, no, no, no!

01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:00.625
- Get after them.
- Impossible.

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:03.416
- We'll be lucky to get to base as it is.

01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:19.875
Get away!

01:15:22.791 --> 01:15:24.125
Leave me alone!

01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:50.000
Morning, sunshine.

01:16:53.583 --> 01:16:55.208
Give me that thing before somebody gets--

01:16:59.208 --> 01:17:00.208
I don't think so.

01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:04.625
So, here's what's gonna happen.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.708
You're gonna secret-agent
our way back to civilization,

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:10.750
and I'm gonna follow
three steps behind you with this gun.

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:13.458
- Where's the Heart?
- Parker has it.

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:17.583
But I encrypted it to my biometrics,
so it's useless without me.

01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:19.625
Come on, get up.

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:26.000
If I shoot you now, all this is over.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.166
Show you the same mercy
you showed Bailey and Yang.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.083
It's the logical play, Rachel.

01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:39.958
It's what the Heart would tell you to do.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.041
I'm not like you.

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:48.458
On your feet.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.458
We need to keep moving.

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.833
So, what's the plan, Keya?

01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:22.000
Trying to get even with Niam Kharche
for kicking you out of the penthouse?

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.125
Right. You think you know everything.

01:18:25.125 --> 01:18:27.250
I bet the Heart
told you that he adopted me,

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:30.208
lifted me out of nothing.
But did it tell you why?

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:38.041
Kharche used my parents like lab rats
in a medical trial, and it killed them.

01:18:39.666 --> 01:18:42.750
He covered everything up and took me in
thinking he was doing me a favor,

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:45.083
but I let him think that
because I knew one day,

01:18:45.083 --> 01:18:48.333
I'd be strong enough to make him pay
for what he did to my parents.

01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:50.708
So, you get to tear the whole world down?

01:18:50.708 --> 01:18:52.208
Oh, this is not just for me.

01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:54.000
It's for people like me.

01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:56.666
Parker's gonna destroy the Charter.

01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:59.666
I've got my whole naughty list,
and we're going to expose them all.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.208
With no thought of what comes next.

01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:05.125
You're a child.

01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:07.708
And you think the Charter's any better?

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.583
Just because they saved you
doesn't make them good.

01:19:12.125 --> 01:19:13.791
You think I didn't look into you?

01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:17.666
How many schools
did you get kicked out of?

01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:20.166
Seven? Eight?

01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:24.000
Always a rebel. Always a problem.

01:19:24.791 --> 01:19:27.208
Violent, alone, helpless.

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:29.125
- Stop.
- Until the Charter comes along, right?

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:31.833
And gives you that discipline
that you so clearly crave.

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.083
But did they take you in
because you were good?

01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:36.875
- Or because you were broken?
- Enough.

01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:41.958
Maybe I was broken.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:47.083
But there's a woman I know only as Nomad.

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:49.208
She rescued me, trained me,

01:19:50.708 --> 01:19:53.958
showed me what's possible
when there's someone watching your back.

01:19:58.416 --> 01:19:59.416
Where is she now?

01:20:01.416 --> 01:20:02.250
Let's go.

01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:06.875
Parker's coming for you, and I wanna have
a bigger gun when he shows up.

01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:34.916
They're headed for us.

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:37.500
Maybe it's Parker.

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.666
It's definitely not the Charter.

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:45.750
Mercenaries?

01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:50.375
Okay, let's just, um,
give them a good cover story.

01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:53.833
They'll keep us alive for ransom.
We reel them in, and then bam.

01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.833
Just to be clear,
the "bam" is for you to take them out.

01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:02.541
Yeah, I get that.

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.958
<i>♪ Zombie no go go
Unless you tell 'em to go ♪</i>

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:44.875
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:48.000
<i>♪ Zombie no go stop

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:48.916
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:21:48.916 --> 01:21:51.583
<i>♪ Zombie no go turn

01:21:51.583 --> 01:21:52.500
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.958
<i>♪ Zombie no go think

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:56.083
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:59.583
<i>- ♪ Zombie, oh zombie ♪
- ♪ Zombie, oh zombie ♪</i>

01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:02.083
You know,
the Charter can take down Kharche.

01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:05.875
<i>♪ Zombie no go go
Unless you tell 'em to go ♪</i>

01:22:05.875 --> 01:22:06.791
<i>♪ Zombie</i>... <i>♪</i>

01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:09.291
Parker's way isn't the only way.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:10.791
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:22:10.791 --> 01:22:13.458
<i>♪ Zombie no go turn

01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:14.375
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.583
<i>♪ Zombie no go think
Unless you tell 'em... ♪</i>

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:05.333
Come with me.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.041
She got away.

01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:21.375
That wasn't the deal.

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:25.375
Killing her wasn't the deal either.
You have to pay me now.

01:24:26.958 --> 01:24:27.958
The deal changed.

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:30.625
You're a hard woman to find.

01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:35.583
Six of Hearts.

01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:37.583
Nomad sends her best.

01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:01.416
Dhawan is back with Parker.
I slipped her a tracker.

01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:04.208
They're heading north. Looping you in now.

01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:07.125
Hi, Rachel.

01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:10.750
Nice to hear your voice.
I was a bit worried about you.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:12.708
Were you?

01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:17.250
Okay, got her.
They're heading towards Iceland.

01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:21.833
I take it I'm no longer compromised.

01:26:22.333 --> 01:26:24.666
Well, they have the Heart,
so we're all compromised.

01:26:25.416 --> 01:26:28.708
<i>Parker's coming after the Charter,
so we're heading to a secure location.</i>

01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.166
<i>Clubs is assembling a team.</i>

01:26:30.166 --> 01:26:32.916
<i>We'll make sure they're on the ground
by the time you arrive.</i>

01:26:32.916 --> 01:26:34.291
And if we're too late?

01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:36.291
Just get there as fast as you can.

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:39.750
If they get the Heart online,
God knows what they're capable of.

01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:40.750
I'm on my way.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:16.500
It's not impregnable,
but it's the best we've got.

01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:21.291
If the Heart wants to find us, it will.

01:27:27.541 --> 01:27:30.000
Will this hunk of junk make it to Iceland?

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:31.583
Hell yeah.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.958
Nice trick you pulled
with the facial recognition yesterday.

01:27:47.708 --> 01:27:49.583
Trying to put a lock on our new toy.

01:27:50.583 --> 01:27:52.541
Would you come back for me if I hadn't?

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:54.833
We're a team, Keya.

01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:57.375
Don't do it again.

01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.458
I think I have it.

01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:13.000
I know where they're going.
Reykjavik University computer lab.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.166
It has a cryo-storage facility,
several floors of servers.

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:17.833
The tracker's heading straight for it.

01:28:20.875 --> 01:28:23.541
See, Keya, don't say
I don't keep my promises.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.666
Okay, be ready.
You know your instructions.

01:28:28.166 --> 01:28:30.541
Couple of minutes,
we'll be up and running.

01:29:13.666 --> 01:29:14.500
Are we up?

01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:19.375
We're up.

01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:42.875
Is this your naughty list?

01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:47.166
Emails, texts, bank accounts. The Heart's
using my algorithm to sort through it all.

01:29:47.166 --> 01:29:49.916
So, we can find anyone?
Gain access to anything?

01:29:49.916 --> 01:29:52.000
Greatest skeleton key in the world.

01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:54.416
Show me.

01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:01.833
There it is.

01:30:02.666 --> 01:30:06.166
Evidence of Kharche's years of experiments
on innocents across the country.

01:30:06.166 --> 01:30:08.833
That's the truth... for the world to see.

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:12.750
That's impressive.
But let's see what else this thing can do.

01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:14.333
Find me the Kings.

01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:17.458
What are you doing?

01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:22.833
Nancy Morrison.
King of Diamonds. Ex-CIA.

01:30:23.333 --> 01:30:26.541
The Heart tells us she's heading to
a safe house with her family.

01:30:27.791 --> 01:30:28.625
Drop the lift.

01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:31.250
Are you serious?

01:30:33.041 --> 01:30:34.458
No. Do--

01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:50.833
You're welcome.

01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:52.750
Hang on. I have another one.

01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:56.208
I think you're gonna like this, boss.

01:30:56.708 --> 01:31:00.625
An unidentified military plane landed
at a private airfield 33 minutes ago.

01:31:02.583 --> 01:31:03.416
There.

01:31:05.666 --> 01:31:10.125
Jiang Hsu. Served 35 years
in Chinese State Security Service.

01:31:10.125 --> 01:31:12.291
The King of Clubs is here in Iceland.

01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:14.083
Even better. Where is he now?

01:31:25.833 --> 01:31:26.791
Two minutes out.

01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:29.375
Sending the plans now.
Stone is on her way.

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:36.708
We don't have time to wait.
Tell her to follow us in.

01:31:39.666 --> 01:31:41.375
Any news of Spades or Hearts?

01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:42.750
 Nothing yet.

01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:47.833
There were other people in that elevator.
In that lobby.

01:31:48.958 --> 01:31:49.916
Calm down, Keya.

01:31:51.083 --> 01:31:55.708
You said we were going to expose Kharche
and then the Charter, not murder them.

01:31:55.708 --> 01:32:00.041
The King of Hearts with her team.
They're in a bunker outside of London.

01:32:01.041 --> 01:32:01.875
Good.

01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:04.083
Take them out.

01:32:08.333 --> 01:32:09.666
<i>We're approaching now.</i>

01:32:09.666 --> 01:32:12.416
<i>- We'll see you on the other side.</i>
- You're going in with them?

01:32:12.416 --> 01:32:15.208
I ordered the strike on Parker.
It's only fair.

01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:18.958
You know... I would have made
the same call in Chechnya.

01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:20.208
Thanks. The right--

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.416
I've lost contact.

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.291
The Heart's online.

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.333
No, no, no, no.

01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:41.291
We're locked in.

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:48.458
Oh God. They've shut off
our ventilation system.

01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:49.916
No, no, no, no.

01:32:55.041 --> 01:32:56.583
Jack, how long we got?

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:02.791
At this rate, about an hour
and we're out of oxygen.

01:33:06.791 --> 01:33:10.000
The Charter never worries about
who gets in their way. Neither will we.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.833
King of Hearts is locked in.
They'll be dead in an hour.

01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:17.000
- You have to stop this, please.
- Someone has to control this power, Keya.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
- Why not us?
- This is not what we agreed.

01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:22.333
You're still not seeing
the bigger picture.

01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:25.333
This isn't about
some pissy little grievance you had

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:27.208
with the bad man
who killed your mom and dad.

01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:29.041
This is about power.

01:33:29.541 --> 01:33:34.291
Concentrated in the hands of the few,
of the very few who could use it for good,

01:33:34.291 --> 01:33:37.041
who could actually make a change,
but they don't.

01:33:41.541 --> 01:33:45.166
At this moment, we are mining
trillions of pieces of data.

01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:48.500
In a matter of hours,
I will be able to take down

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.458
the remaining members of the Charter.

01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:55.291
We've been used
and manipulated our whole lives.

01:33:56.375 --> 01:33:58.250
Now it's time for us to take control.

01:34:24.083 --> 01:34:24.916
Go.

01:34:33.208 --> 01:34:35.875
Clubs team are inside
the university building.

01:34:37.375 --> 01:34:38.875
What... are you doing?

01:34:40.916 --> 01:34:43.125
You wanna know
how great men get power, Keya?

01:34:44.916 --> 01:34:46.458
<i>It's not because they earn it...</i>

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:49.625
<i>or because they deserve it.</i>

01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:53.416
It is because when the moment comes,

01:34:54.833 --> 01:34:55.666
they take it.

01:35:09.125 --> 01:35:10.541
Stone is one minute out.

01:35:12.208 --> 01:35:13.833
In position. We're all set.

01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:20.833
She's approaching the university.

01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:41.041
Stone, you need to get out now.

01:35:41.041 --> 01:35:42.458
<i>I don't have long.</i>

01:35:42.458 --> 01:35:43.375
Keya?

01:35:43.375 --> 01:35:45.916
I have a failsafe uploading.
It will disable the Heart.

01:35:45.916 --> 01:35:47.916
They won't be able
to access it without me.

01:35:47.916 --> 01:35:51.125
I'm outside. But you already know that.

01:35:51.125 --> 01:35:53.458
No, you're not. It's a trap.

01:35:54.541 --> 01:35:55.666
<i>I found your tracker.</i>

01:35:55.666 --> 01:35:59.083
The lab is a decoy.
You need to get your team out now.

01:36:00.083 --> 01:36:02.583
- Why should I believe you?
- Because you were right.

01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:06.083
Okay? You told me about Parker,
and you were right about everything.

01:36:06.583 --> 01:36:08.708
My parents would have never wanted this.

01:36:08.708 --> 01:36:10.750
<i>Just please listen to me.</i>

01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:12.791
Get your team out of there right now.

01:36:22.458 --> 01:36:24.625
- Tell me where you are.
-  <i>Okay.</i>

01:36:24.625 --> 01:36:28.083
I'm sending you my coordinates.
I'll leave the back door open.

01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:31.166
Shit.

01:36:41.708 --> 01:36:44.375
I'm Nine of Hearts.
I need your radio.

01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:49.625
Go.

01:36:52.375 --> 01:36:55.333
This is Nine of Hearts.
Get out of there. It's a trap.

01:37:00.666 --> 01:37:03.833
Do you hear me?
She found the tracker. Get out of there.

01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:11.500
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:14.333
Yeah... I hear you.

01:37:46.291 --> 01:37:47.333
What's going on?

01:37:48.333 --> 01:37:49.625
- Where is she?

01:37:49.625 --> 01:37:51.916
- What has she done?

01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:54.166
- How long to fix it?
- Oh.

01:37:54.791 --> 01:37:57.500
I-- Could be minutes. Could be hours.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.541
You have until I get back.

01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:08.083
 The door won't move.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.750
Damn it!

01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:13.166
There must be
an emergency override system.

01:38:13.166 --> 01:38:15.041
We must have missed something.

01:38:15.041 --> 01:38:17.500
Jack, is there any way
we can get hold of Stone?

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.541
No. No comms. We're still offline.

01:38:21.916 --> 01:38:24.250
Maybe-- Maybe try the landline.

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:39.916
Okay. Okay.

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:10.750
-  <i>Stone, thank God. Where are you?</i>
- Clubs are dead.

01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:13.916
<i>University was a trap.</i>

01:39:15.791 --> 01:39:17.083
I have new intel.

01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:19.000
A new location.

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.208
We've-- We've lost Clubs?

01:39:23.083 --> 01:39:24.000
What new intel?

01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.541
<i>Keya. She shut down the Heart.</i>

01:39:28.708 --> 01:39:32.125
- How do you know she's not playing you?
- I don't.

01:39:35.625 --> 01:39:37.833
<i>We're gonna die in less than an hour.</i>

01:39:38.375 --> 01:39:40.583
<i>- They shut down our air supply.</i>
- What?

01:39:40.583 --> 01:39:43.625
- She shut down our air supply.
-  <i>Parker did.</i>

01:39:43.625 --> 01:39:45.125
I believe her, Nomad.

01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:48.041
I'd be dead too
if I hadn't listened to her.

01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:50.750
I trust her, and you need to trust me.

01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:55.083
Fifty minutes.

01:39:57.625 --> 01:39:58.875
I can work with that.

01:40:02.458 --> 01:40:03.291
I'll see you.

01:40:10.583 --> 01:40:11.416
You too.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.416

01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:32.958

Sorry, I need your truck.

01:42:19.541 --> 01:42:21.416
I know you're in here, Keya.

01:42:25.125 --> 01:42:27.125
You know, you still have a choice.

01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:31.958
You can still be a part of this.

01:42:38.333 --> 01:42:40.458
You're only delaying the inevitable.

01:43:17.708 --> 01:43:20.208
- Would you like me to wait?
-  Definitely no.

01:43:20.833 --> 01:43:21.791
But thanks!

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:47.291
Come on, Keya.

01:44:07.833 --> 01:44:09.083
Settle down now.

01:44:09.916 --> 01:44:10.750
Conserve air.

01:44:42.166 --> 01:44:43.500
- Move.

01:44:47.041 --> 01:44:48.666
Get the Heart back online.

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:50.250
Do it!

01:44:53.708 --> 01:44:54.541
Get up.

01:44:55.041 --> 01:44:56.000
Get up!

01:45:04.833 --> 01:45:06.750
Right. Where do we start?

01:45:07.833 --> 01:45:08.666
Fingers?

01:45:08.666 --> 01:45:10.750
No, we'll be needing those. Knees?

01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:12.666
- Yeah.

01:45:12.666 --> 01:45:13.750
Last chance.

01:45:14.958 --> 01:45:16.666
Okay, I'll do it.

01:45:19.208 --> 01:45:20.041
Go on.

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.333
I need to get back in there.

01:45:24.291 --> 01:45:27.750
The Heart has to be disconnected
and reconnected again to the servers.

01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:31.541
Any interference, the system
automatically shuts down. You know that.

01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:34.125
Move.

01:46:01.833 --> 01:46:05.416
This doesn't end well for you, Stone.
Take another step, and she's dead.

01:46:05.416 --> 01:46:08.625
- I don't care. I'm here for you.
-  Bullshit.

01:46:09.458 --> 01:46:11.333
You and I know that without this one,

01:46:11.333 --> 01:46:14.291
the Heart stays down
and everyone inside that bunker dies,

01:46:14.291 --> 01:46:16.291
unless, of course, they're dead already.

01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:20.333
I have the Heart, and I have the Kings.
That's a winning hand.

01:46:31.416 --> 01:46:32.791
Okay. I'll put it down.

01:46:39.416 --> 01:46:41.708
Good girl. Now, kick it away.

01:46:44.875 --> 01:46:46.125
Tell me this, though.

01:46:47.041 --> 01:46:48.375
What's your point, hm?

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.666
And why do you have to
kill them to make it?

01:46:52.416 --> 01:46:55.916
I've served my entire life,
Rachel, and none of it mattered.

01:46:55.916 --> 01:46:57.666
The world is still in chaos.

01:46:59.208 --> 01:47:01.416
The Heart has the power
to change everything.

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:05.583
But the Charter are using it
to keep things exactly as they are.

01:47:05.583 --> 01:47:09.291
You don't wanna change anything.
You just wanna be the one in charge.

01:47:09.791 --> 01:47:12.708
First thing you did
with all that power was kill people.

01:47:13.333 --> 01:47:16.625
The problem
with men like you, Parker,

01:47:17.125 --> 01:47:20.333
is that your power is only ever based on
threats and violence.

01:47:20.833 --> 01:47:24.500
And when you brutalize everyone
around you, even your own team...

01:47:25.833 --> 01:47:28.708
you'll never have
the one thing I know I always will.

01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:32.708
Yeah?

01:47:33.625 --> 01:47:35.125
And what is that, Rachel?

01:47:36.916 --> 01:47:38.666
Someone to watch my back.

01:49:30.041 --> 01:49:32.875
Maybe in the next life.

01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:36.125
See you when I get there.

01:50:33.416 --> 01:50:35.458
<i>Nomad, tell me you're okay.</i>

01:50:42.875 --> 01:50:44.375
Is everyone still with us?

01:50:47.166 --> 01:50:50.791
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:58.458 --> 01:51:00.208
It's good to hear from you, Stone.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:02.916
I knew I would.

01:51:30.958 --> 01:51:31.791
Hey, Barry.

01:51:46.041 --> 01:51:46.875
What's this?

01:51:47.375 --> 01:51:48.250
I don't know.

01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:49.666
It's beautiful.

01:51:49.666 --> 01:51:51.625
But what is it? Who's it from?

01:52:06.833 --> 01:52:08.083
Looking good.

01:52:09.375 --> 01:52:12.833
I decided to embrace the cliché
and use my time in jail to get ripped.

01:52:14.875 --> 01:52:16.250
You've had worse goals.

01:52:17.541 --> 01:52:18.875
So my lawyers tell me.

01:52:21.708 --> 01:52:23.291
And you? Back with the Charter?

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.916
Yeah, I'm back with the Charter.

01:52:29.625 --> 01:52:31.041
But on two conditions.

01:52:33.083 --> 01:52:34.750
The Heart's an amazing tool.

01:52:35.708 --> 01:52:36.958
But that's all it is.

01:52:38.125 --> 01:52:41.875
If we only follow the odds, we'll
never do anything in spite of the odds.

01:52:42.875 --> 01:52:45.416
And what if the odds
tell you to do nothing?

01:52:47.458 --> 01:52:48.958
That's when they send me.

01:52:53.083 --> 01:52:54.458
What's the second thing?

01:52:56.375 --> 01:52:57.750
I liked my team, Keya.

01:52:58.541 --> 01:52:59.375
I miss them.

01:53:01.125 --> 01:53:04.833
I wanna surround myself with people
who will change the world for good.

01:53:21.541 --> 01:53:22.666
How we doing, Jack?

01:53:23.333 --> 01:53:24.875
<i>Good news and bad news.</i>

01:53:24.875 --> 01:53:28.166
<i>The good news, I've scouted the square,
and your plan just might work.</i>

01:53:29.666 --> 01:53:30.625
<i>The bad news--</i>

01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:35.500
Uh, they were out of oat milk.

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.375
- Jack.

01:53:37.375 --> 01:53:39.250
What? You told me to blend in.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.583
Did we get into the power grid?

01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:47.041
Yeah. It wasn't that hard,
because their password was "password."

01:53:49.083 --> 01:53:49.916
Your coffee.

01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:51.750
Thank you.

01:53:54.666 --> 01:53:55.625
This is cold.

01:53:55.625 --> 01:53:58.833
Um, you know we can still
throw you in jail, right?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:01.833
Hey.

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:04.458
Stay in the van.

01:54:05.875 --> 01:54:07.500
We stay in the van, boss.

01:54:09.291 --> 01:54:10.833

Go give them the bam.

01:54:25.083 --> 01:54:25.916
Always.
