16

Stone, how we doing?

17
00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.875
Almost there.
Just pulling the encryption key.

18
00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.583
Four hours in the van,
and she's eaten all the crisps.

19
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.166
She's stuck in there with you,
so that's comfort eating.

20
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.375
Been boring her with your cat chat again?

21
00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:21.250
Cat chat? Actually, Parker,
she likes my Barry the Cat stories.

22
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.458
You like my Barry the Cat stories, right?

23
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:26.250
Before you know it,
you're gonna want one of your own.

24
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.791
Cats hate me. Sorry, Bailey.

25
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:30.416
Writing a new access code.

26
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:32.791
Grazie.

27
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.125
I have eyes on Mulvaney.

28
00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:37.208
Intel was good.

29
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.458
I can't believe it.

30
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:43.916
Europe's most wanted arms dealer
seen for the first time in three years.

31
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.916
Adding names and faces to the guest list.

32
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.208
- How long do you need?
- Nearly there.

33
00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.333
Hang on. Something's changed.
I can't connect.

34
00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:57.291
The system's offline.

35
00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:58.458
Local access only.

36
00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.500
We need a new plan to get you in.

37
00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:03.583
What do you mean?

38
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.791
I need direct access
to someone who's already on the network.

39
00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.333
Head of security. He's at the bar.

40
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.791
I could hack his phone,
but I'll need to be close to him.

41
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.833
- How close?
- Ten feet.

42
00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:23.333
Stone, you're not a field agent.
Do not get out of the van.

43
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.166
She can do this.

44
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:27.750
It's too dangerous.

45
00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.125
Mulvaney's entering now.

46
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:43.291
Our arms dealer's on the move right now,
and I do not wanna lose him.

47
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.708
There's no other way.
We have to get Mulvaney.

48
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.291
Tell me what you need.

49
00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:53.583
When I'm within ten feet
of the head of security, call his phone.

50
00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:54.833
Okay, got it.

51
00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:56.833
Hey. Hey, Stone.

52
00:02:58.208 --> 00:02:59.208
You got this.

53
00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:01.875
Thanks, Bailey.

54
00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.208
I can't tail them any further.

55
00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.875
Stone, listen to me.
Waiter to your right.

56
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.291
Grab a glass of champagne.

57
00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.875
- Thank you.
- Good. Now, drink it.

58
00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:34.208
Liquid courage.

59
00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:41.416
He's headed towards the blackjack table.

60
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:44.000
Do you know how to play?

61
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.375
I was on the chess team.

62
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:47.875
Oh my God.

63
00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:52.916
- Just place a bet.
- Welcome.

64
00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:54.833
Doesn't matter if you lose.

65
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.708
Change set, seven. One hundred.

66
00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:06.708
One hundred, change seven.

67
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:15.250
Okay, I have access.

68
00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.875
One hundred, sir, in change.
Okay. Everybody ready?

69
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.250
He's looking suspicious.

70
00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.583
Place your bets.

71
00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:24.791
He's headed towards you.

72
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:30.750
Stone, walk away.

73
00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:34.125
Walk away. Walk away--

74
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:35.750
What are you doing?

75
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.500
I've never played before.

76
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.208
- Sixteen.
- I'm sorry.

77
00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:47.041
You split your eights.

78
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.875
Splitting your eights. Eighteen.

79
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:51.625
Eighteen.

80
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:55.708
Dealer has 17.

81
00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.125
- Ah, you win.
- You win it.

82
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:02.791
Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead.

83
00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.416
Thank you.

84
00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:08.291
Nice job, Stone.

85
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:10.043
Not bad
for your first time out of the van.

86
00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:12.208
I think I just lost two years off my life.

87
00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.250
- Did it work?
- Yeah, I'm in.

88
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.208
Where the hell's Mulvaney?

89
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:18.791
Okay. Got him.
Through the kitchen, down the stairs.

90
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.583
Two heavies working the door.

91
00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:21.666
On our way.

92
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.833
Inserting you into facial recognition.

93
00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:43.833
Hello, beautiful.

94
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:47.416
May I take this seat?

95
00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:51.291
Take it anywhere you like.

96
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.208
Okay.

97
00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:55.625
Maybe later?

98
00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:00.000
Okay, you're all set.

99
00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:03.791
I'm almost afraid to see
what drew Mulvaney out of his hole.

100
00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:09.041
- Lads.
- Buona sera.

101
00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:17.666
Okay.

102
00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:23.125
We're now taking bets for the next game,

103
00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:25.333
which will begin in two minutes.

104
00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:27.583
You were right
about Mulvaney's gambling habit.

105
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:29.833
He never met a bet he didn't place.

106
00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:33.500
You must predict the exact order of kills.

107
00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:36.083
Copy, Delta Kilo Six.
We have reported hostiles...

108
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:37.750
Those are military operations.

109
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.666
They're wagering on body count.

110
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.708
With a bet
of four instant kills,

111
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:48.125
this is a win for player number 46.

112
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.750
Betting on blood.

113
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Yang, show me.

114
00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:55.708
Just a bit to your right.

115
00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:57.500
Holy shit.

116
00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:01.041
That's US Navy Seals in real-time.

117
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.583
And they've cracked
military-grade encryption.

118
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:05.541
Who would have that capability?

119
00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:07.833
Enough tech talk.

120
00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:09.041
Target is Mulvaney.

121
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.541
Okay, Dr. Yang. You have the floor.

122
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:15.541
Time to give Mulvaney his heart attack.

123
00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:18.041
I'll fire up the ambulance.

124
00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:39.000
Mulvaney's exiting.

125
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.583
You.

126
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.166
Shit.

127
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.333
I'll handle this guy.
You take Mulvaney.

128
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.833
Stone.

129
00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:19.625
Mulvaney's on your right.
Another service corridor.

130
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.708
Stand by to go dark.

131
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:29.875
Shit.

132
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:40.291
I've got Mulvaney.
Bailey, get us out of here. Fast.

133
00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:43.083
Showtime!

134
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.416
All right. Okay. All right.

135
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:04.333
MI6, right?

136
00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.250
You guys really need
to work on your subtlety.

137
00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:10.666
You ruined my party.

138
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.666
I should've listened
to the voices in my head.

139
00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:17.750
"The British are coming.
The British are coming."

140
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.750
Comms compromised.

141
00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:22.833
- No shit.
- Okay, okay. New plan.

142
00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:24.791
Exfil route Bravo. We have to go dark.

143
00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.000
Copy that. See you down there.

144
00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:28.958
Come on.

145
00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.250
Stone! Let's go.

146
00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:42.000
Hey!

147
00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:43.791
I'm not going anywhere.

148
00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.000
We're not done yet.

149
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.500
More of Mulvaney's men.

150
00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:17.000
They're heading to the cable car station.
Parker's a sitting duck.

151
00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.625
We need to get down there now.

152
00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:36.000
- Stone!
- Go without me. I'll be fine.

153
00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:38.625
Stay put. We'll be back.

154
00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:58.625
Jack, this is Nine of Hearts.
Urgent forecast required.

155
00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.291
Nine, we have your position
and the full overview.

156
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:04.541
Projecting forward now.

157
00:11:09.458 --> 00:11:12.208
The MI6 team
won't get down the mountain in time.

158
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:15.083
The Heart gives
a 93 percent chance that Parker will die

159
00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:18.375
and Mulvaney will get away
unless the Charter intervenes.

160
00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:22.291
I'm gonna need a parachute.

161
00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:24.750
Okay.

162
00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:27.791
Fifty meters away,
over the handrail to your right.

163
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.041
And don't blow your cover.

164
00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:35.125
On it.

165
00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:43.083
Oi!

166
00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:57.125
The Heart has
a chance of success at just 32 percent.

167
00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:59.000
Not helping, Jack.

168
00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

169
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.125
Um... Stone, big drop coming up.

170
00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:09.583
Big drop.

171
00:12:09.666 --> 00:12:11.541
- How big?
- The mother of big.

172
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:13.875
Really, really big.

173
00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:23.791
And we're in the game.

174
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.333
Look, I've got money.

175
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.083
More than you can imagine.

176
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.416
It wouldn't be enough.

177
00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.875
Eight minutes out.
We're not gonna make it.

178
00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:59.250
Stone, Mulvaney's security
are arriving at the cable car station.

179
00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:08.416
Take the route to your left.
You need to pick up the pace.

180
00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:27.166
The terrain's too flat,
and you're losing altitude.

181
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.083
If you cut across to the piste,
you can pick up a snow bike.

182
00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:41.333
Cables! Cables! Cables! Ca--

183
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:11.166
Chance of success just plummeted.

184
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.250
Only 'cause you've got no imagination.

185
00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:19.083
Oh, nice. Nice.

186
00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:34.500
Oh, you're joking!

187
00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:35.583
Come on!

188
00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:39.333
He can hold them off without us, right?

189
00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:41.875
Hold on!

190
00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:52.625
You can get ahead of
the bikes at the next corner.

191
00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:07.041
Hey. Are you okay?

192
00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:11.958
We meet again.

193
00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:14.333
Must be destiny.

194
00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:16.541
Must be.

195
00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:20.291
Hey.

196
00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:24.625
Hey! Hey!

197
00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.833
Stone, watch Bailey
and Yang to your right.

198
00:16:11.916 --> 00:16:14.208
The Charter's worked
too hard to embed you in MI6.

199
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.166
We cannot risk your cover.

200
00:16:16.916 --> 00:16:17.916
Well aware, Jack.

201
00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.291
How many in the welcome party?

202
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.916
Six of them.

203
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.291
Four pistols, one shotgun, and a sniper

204
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.041
with a very impressive record.

205
00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:46.583
Get out of the way!

206
00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:52.750
Get away from them.
Take the path to your right.

207
00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:19.958
The sniper has opened fire on Parker.

208
00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:30.875
Jack, give me a line.

209
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:52.708
I got the lights.

210
00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:02.125
Behind you!

211
00:18:10.666 --> 00:18:13.041
Chance of success to 85%.

212
00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.250
Only 85%?

213
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.458
Hardly seems fair.

214
00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:19.041
Uh... two more on your right.

215
00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:33.375
Look at that.

216
00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:36.458
Parker and target still very much alive.

217
00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:38.166
Great.

218
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.000
Now, hide the bodies
and get out before MI6 sees you.

219
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.500
Okay.

220
00:18:58.666 --> 00:18:59.666
What's happening?

221
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500
- Yang.
- Hey.

222
00:19:12.875 --> 00:19:13.875
Where'd they go?

223
00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:15.916
Where'd who go?

224
00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:18.375
Mulvaney had an army of security.

225
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:21.208
Got scared off by the sirens maybe?

226
00:19:21.291 --> 00:19:23.625
No point waiting to find out.
Let's just grab him and go.

227
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.666
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! He's foaming.
- Shit.

228
00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:35.958
Bastard took cyanide.

229
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.208
That's old school.

230
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:40.333
Shit.

231
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:42.958
Jesus. He's dead.

232
00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:49.875
Grab a leg. We have to get
back up the mountain for Stone.

233
00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:57.708
All right, genius. Now what?

Genuine dog's breakfast.

00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:47.166
The Italians are livid,
as are Defense and Number 10.

265
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.916
- I take full responsibility.
- "I." That's your problem, Parker.

266
00:21:51.666 --> 00:21:52.875
Mulvaney's dead.

267
00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:55.458
Yang gave the wrong person a heart attack.

268
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:58.916
And Stone, what the hell
were you thinking getting out of the van?

269
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.791
- That was the only way she could get--
- Put it in the report.

270
00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:04.958
Paperwork. Excellent.
That'll show Mulvaney's lads who's boss.

271
00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:05.875
Enough.

272
00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:09.208
Mulvaney's gone. And so is
any hope of using him as an asset.

273
00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:11.208
But now we have a new target.

274
00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:15.916
Someone broke through the highest levels
of military encryption, including our own.

275
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.083
- Did you look into the girl?
- The girl?

276
00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:21.041
Oh, yes. I'm afraid
we'll need more than that.

277
00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:24.166
We are trying to trace her,
but so far, we have nothing.

278
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.333
- I'm happy to look--
- We have people for that.

279
00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:27.416
Different people.

280
00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:31.333
You can all concentrate
on your admin. Sandra.

281
00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:36.000
Cheers, Sandra.

282
00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:37.333
Thanks, Sandra.

283
00:22:37.416 --> 00:22:38.416
Love you, Sandra.

284
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:43.666
To Stone.

285
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.166
- First time out of the van.
- Hey!

286
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.250
- And she didn't blow the op--
- No, we did that all on our own.

287
00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:52.500
Too bad. Been on a good winning streak
since Stone joined us.

288
00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:55.916
Thought you might be our lucky charm.
But you did win at blackjack.

289
00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:59.958
And I'm never gambling again
or stepping out of the van.

290
00:23:01.458 --> 00:23:03.291
What'd you do when I left you up there?

291
00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:05.708
Hid in the toilets.

292
00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:10.250
- What? You said to stay out of sight.
- True.

293
00:23:10.333 --> 00:23:11.958
All right. Leave her alone.

294
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.833
We got more important things to discuss.

295
00:23:14.916 --> 00:23:16.291
Like, the girl.

296
00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:19.458
But let's be honest.
We already know who she works for.

297
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:23.125
- God.
- That's right. The Charter.

298
00:23:23.208 --> 00:23:25.000
Strap yourselves in.

299
00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:28.500
Whatever. I just identified
another one of their ops.

300
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:33.041
They took out a terror cell who hijacked
an oil tanker in the Panama Canal.

301
00:23:33.541 --> 00:23:35.708
Yeah, but who would have
that kind of power?

302
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:37.291
Hm.

303
00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:39.458
- I'm doing it again, aren't I?
- Yeah.

304
00:23:39.541 --> 00:23:41.125
Okay, fine, mock me.

305
00:23:41.208 --> 00:23:42.291
But it's true.

306
00:23:42.375 --> 00:23:46.083
Ex-intelligence operatives
answering only to themselves.

307
00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:48.666
No national allegiances,
no political leanings.

308
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.125
Putting out fires their governments
never allowed them to. That's...

309
00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:54.333
That's the Charter.

310
00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:56.500
The most highly trained agents

311
00:23:56.583 --> 00:23:59.666
working together to keep peace
in a turbulent world.

312
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.166
No. That is a Saturday morning cartoon.

313
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.791
Nobody knows about
the Charter because they don't exist.

314
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.791
Pass me the vinegar.

315
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:09.041
And this girl.

316
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:11.541
This girl is part of it, and you know it.

317
00:24:12.666 --> 00:24:15.000
Okay, don't judge me.
I'm gonna go with this for a sec.

318
00:24:15.666 --> 00:24:18.458
- If the Charter are such do-gooders...
- Mm.

319
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:20.085
...why'd the girl interrupt our mission?

320
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.125
Oh. Oh!

321
00:24:21.916 --> 00:24:23.583
That's a good question. Yep.

322
00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:28.083
Sorry, Bailey, there is no secret genius
organization pulling all the strings.

323
00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:30.875
It's just us, Sandra, and her paperwork.

324
00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:35.541
But it was a nice bedtime story.
Speaking of which...

325
00:24:36.416 --> 00:24:37.458
Already?

326
00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:40.875
- Jet lag.
- Um, there's a one-hour time difference.

327
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.583
Night, guys.

328
00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:44.166
- Night.
- Night.

329
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.125
Right in the eye.

330
00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:53.958
- I drive with that eye.
- Might make you a better driver.

331
00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:55.833
Can't make you worse.

332
00:24:55.916 --> 00:24:58.291
- Kidding. I take it back.
- No.

333
00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:12.875
Sneaking up on me?

334
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:15.708
A field agent
should be ready for anything.

335
00:26:18.083 --> 00:26:21.166
You were saying?
I never should have told you I swim.

336
00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:22.875
A weak moment.

337
00:26:23.708 --> 00:26:24.708
I liked it.

338
00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:28.083
So... the girl.

339
00:26:28.916 --> 00:26:29.916
What news?

340
00:26:30.583 --> 00:26:33.250
No news. We were told not to look.

341
00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:35.000
You're a terrible liar.

342
00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:38.250
Look, if we leave it
to the pen-pushers at MI6,

343
00:26:38.333 --> 00:26:40.583
she'll hack the entire world
before we even get a name.

344
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.416
I should've gone beyond the mission
and brought her in.

345
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.875
Well, your hands were pretty full
at the time.

346
00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:48.375
And besides, it wasn't our objective.

347
00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:51.916
Why don't you try and live a little?
Could be fun.

348
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.333
What happened to
"Don't get out of the van, Rachel"?

349
00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:56.416
Ah.

350
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.250
- This is different.
- Hm.

351
00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:02.000
So, rules are rules
unless they apply to you.

352
00:27:02.083 --> 00:27:04.750
Why do I feel like you know me better
than I know you?

353
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.835
Maybe I should listen to one of these
dreary pod-casts of yours.

354
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.958
Bailey got to you, huh?

355
00:27:12.458 --> 00:27:14.958
Mock our music,
and I won't tell you my theory.

356
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:16.166
My lips are sealed.

357
00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:25.958
She's new to the scene. Has to be.

358
00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:28.625
Otherwise, we would have heard about her.

359
00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:30.666
To get a guest list like that--

360
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.375
She's working with someone else.
A veteran. But who?

361
00:27:34.208 --> 00:27:36.083
We'll make a list. I'll bring snacks.

362
00:27:37.916 --> 00:27:41.541
I, uh, I'm sorry.
I already have... a brunch date.

363
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:44.375
Can I come?

364
00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:47.708
Bye, Parker.

365
00:28:11.833 --> 00:28:13.458
Ivo? It's been a while.

366
00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:16.416
Nine of Hearts, it's good to see you.

367
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.291
- How's it going?
- It's been busy. This way.

368
00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:23.916
The Charter has been dealing with
three actionable threats this morning.

369
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.375
Potential sarin gas attack in Paris.

370
00:28:26.458 --> 00:28:30.916
The Heart predicted the time and location
of the attack with 87% certainty.

371
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.833
Eight of Hearts is on site now.

372
00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:36.291
Six is defusing
a potential international incident

373
00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:37.750
in the South China Sea.

374
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:43.000
And Diamonds team's handling hackers
targeting the North American power grid.

375
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.416
That, um... That's the peacock.

376
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.000
- Hi.
- Came with the house.

377
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.333
Hey, Jack.

378
00:28:52.416 --> 00:28:53.625
Enjoying your new office?

379
00:28:53.708 --> 00:28:55.958
We can't all be
gallivanting around the Alps.

380
00:28:56.458 --> 00:28:59.458
How's King of Hearts? Is she angry?

381
00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:00.666
Have you seen her yet?

382
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.291
Well, let's see. You lost control
of the situation, target is dead,

383
00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:05.916
then you had to kill six men.

384
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.208
What a glorious outcome.

385
00:29:07.708 --> 00:29:10.416
- Victoria Crosses all around.
- Morning, Nomad.

386
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.625
Good to see you too.
Love what you've done with the place.

387
00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:16.833
Is she developing a sense of humor?

388
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.500
- Did you find the girl?
- Of course.

389
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.250
Keya Dhawan.

390
00:29:23.083 --> 00:29:26.083
She is from Pune in the west of India.

391
00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:27.791
Orphaned at eight.

392
00:29:28.916 --> 00:29:30.458
How'd she learn to program?

393
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:32.208
Ever heard of Niam Kharche?

394
00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:34.750
Billionaire investor, pharmaceuticals.

395
00:29:34.833 --> 00:29:36.250
Had business in Pune.

396
00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:39.333
Ran IT workshops for kids
in underprivileged communities.

397
00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:43.583
He spotted her
in one of these programs.

398
00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:47.333
Yeah. He saw she was a prodigy,
took her under his wing, trained her up,

399
00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:49.833
and then they had a falling out.

400
00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:50.916
Why?

401
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.000
The Heart's better at whats than whys.

402
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:55.958
And the what is,
she split from Kharche and disappeared.

403
00:29:59.083 --> 00:30:00.166
She's 22 now.

404
00:30:00.708 --> 00:30:02.458
Not much older than when we met.

405
00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:05.333
Yes, but she fell in with
a bunch of criminal lowlifes.

406
00:30:05.416 --> 00:30:07.250
Some people get all the luck.

407
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:12.083
We think that Keya
set up the casino of blood.

408
00:30:12.583 --> 00:30:15.916
She knew about Mulvaney's
gambling habit and used it to lure him in.

409
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Why?

410
00:30:18.125 --> 00:30:22.291
Mulvaney had become
obsessed with a new weapon, a myth.

411
00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:26.875
A quantum computer sophisticated enough
to hack into anything, anywhere.

412
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
The Heart.

413
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.416
So, where is she now?

414
00:30:41.083 --> 00:30:43.291
The Heart predicts with 96% certainty

415
00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:46.291
that Keya is heading to Lisbon
for the opening of Club Moritz.

416
00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:49.291
So, we will leak her location to MI6.

417
00:30:49.375 --> 00:30:52.875
Then we should have your operation
back up and running within 24 hours.

418
00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:54.625
It doesn't feel right.

419
00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:59.375
Keya chose to hack into
our comms feed on the mountain.

420
00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:01.916
She revealed herself to me,
looked me straight in the eye.

421
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.583
I'm not sure
if we should ignore the Heart,

422
00:31:04.666 --> 00:31:07.333
the closest mankind
has to perfect intelligence,

423
00:31:07.416 --> 00:31:09.166
because of eye contact in a bar.

424
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.916
This might be why you're single, Jack.

425
00:31:11.833 --> 00:31:13.250
Just follow the numbers.

426
00:31:14.125 --> 00:31:15.500
Your mission is Lisbon.

427
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:17.500
And if she's not there?

428
00:31:17.583 --> 00:31:18.583
Eat tapas.

429
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:21.041
Just not with your MI6 team.

430
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.125
So, you're spying on me now.

431
00:31:27.916 --> 00:31:29.458
I'm tracking my asset.

432
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:33.625
You know what you signed up for.

433
00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:37.041
No relationships. No friends.

434
00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:39.208
No poolside tête-à-tête.

435
00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:43.291
What we do is too important.

436
00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:46.916
When governments fail,
the only thing left is the Charter.

437
00:31:47.416 --> 00:31:49.791
I'm undercover. This is just part of it.

438
00:31:51.125 --> 00:31:53.250
- Everything's under control.
- Good.

439
00:31:54.625 --> 00:31:55.625
Keep it that way.

440
00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:58.125
Your target is Dhawan.

441
00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:19.916
Come on, Keya. Take the bait.

442
00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:48.125
Smile.

443
00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:36.750
Hey, Bailey.

444
00:33:36.833 --> 00:33:38.958
Hey.
We got a lead on hacker girl.

445
00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:40.166
We're going to Lisbon.

446
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.541
Better call the cat sitter.

447
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:44.958
Oh no, no. Barry's all right. He's--

448
00:33:45.583 --> 00:33:47.583
I told him, no parties.

449
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.916
Okay. Sweet dreams.

450
00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:53.250
Wheels up at eight.

451
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Got it.

452
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:57.708
- Night, Bailey.
- Night.

453
00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:07.250
What about this?

454
00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:10.416
Ah Jesus. Just when we thought
it couldn't get worse.

455
00:34:11.625 --> 00:34:14.458
- Are you singing?
- I'm clearing my throat.

456
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:15.541
Tune.

457
00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:17.208
- Look at that.
- No.

458
00:34:17.291 --> 00:34:18.416

She has the same taste in music,

468
00:34:57.583 --> 00:34:58.958
and you have the same hair.

469
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.291
It's my van, my tunes.

470
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:04.833
Yeah, that's what she says.

471
00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:12.791
- Oh, sorry.
- Whoa.

472
00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:15.416
Little harder next time.
I didn't quite crack a tooth.

473

You okay back there?

474
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.041
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...

- Carsick.
- Mm.

476
00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:26.583
It's Bailey's music.

477
00:35:27.083 --> 00:35:28.625
Come on, swap seats with me.

478
00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:32.333
- What? No, no, no. It's fine.
- Come on. No, it's fine. Move.

Bailey!

482
00:35:42.291 --> 00:35:44.291
Aren't you supposed to be an elite driver?

483
00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:45.583
Sorry.

484
00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.041
- Okay?
- Yeah.

485
00:36:07.375 --> 00:36:08.958
How long till the club opens?

486
00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:10.916
We head out in a couple of hours.

487
00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:21.958
Hey, Stone.

488
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.791
Sent you something. Check it out.

489
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:31.375
- What is this?
- It's for my niece's birthday.

490
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.375
What do you think? Female perspective?

491
00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:37.541
It's very pink.

492
00:36:59.333 --> 00:37:01.583
Parker, this music is ancient.

493
00:37:01.666 --> 00:37:04.708
- What are you, a hundred years old?
- It's called culture.

494
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.416
Yeah. Sorry, Parker, I'm with Yang. Yang!

495

522

Six hostiles entering the building...

523
00:38:25.166 --> 00:38:26.166
Nine, I have you.

524
00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:29.958
Six hostiles moving up the stairs.
More outside.

525
00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.583
They'll breach the doorway in four...

526
00:38:33.708 --> 00:38:34.708
three...

527
00:38:35.875 --> 00:38:36.875
two...

00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:38.791
one.

529
00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:53.041
Parker.

530
00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:22.166
We're gonna get you out.

531
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:27.875
Stone, go now!

532
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.541
Nine, the window.

533
00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:40.541
Get out. Now.

534
00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:47.875
Stone, you will die.

535
00:39:58.208 --> 00:39:59.583
Jack, I need your help.

536
00:40:00.416 --> 00:40:02.791
Plotting exit routes... now.

537
00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:05.000
Come on. Parker, come on. Come on!

538
00:40:21.458 --> 00:40:22.666
I'm going back in.

539
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.208
What? No.

540
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:25.875
Saving them is not your mission.

541
00:40:25.958 --> 00:40:27.625
- Get out of there.
- Jack, please.

542
00:40:27.708 --> 00:40:30.208
No. At best, you break cover.
Most likely, you die.

543
00:40:36.083 --> 00:40:37.083
Stone?

544
00:40:38.375 --> 00:40:39.375
Stone?

545
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:40.791
Stone!

546
00:42:07.083 --> 00:42:08.416
- Holy shit.
- Come on.

547
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:10.750
Time to go.

548
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.791
There'll be more. Come on.

549
00:42:27.583 --> 00:42:29.500
Van's a no-go. Go, go.

550
00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:52.750
Does that thing ever work?

551
00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:54.125
Yeah, yeah. It works.

552
00:42:54.208 --> 00:42:55.416
Just not on every car.

553
00:42:58.166 --> 00:42:59.500
There. Move!

554
00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:19.333
Stone. Now would be good.

555
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.375
Move over. I've got this.

556
00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:35.625
- Away from the guns, Stone. Away!
- Just a second.

557
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:45.000
Down! Down! Down!

558
00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:10.541
Go! Go, go, go, go!

559
00:44:17.208 --> 00:44:19.166
Okay, Stone. Time to start talking.

560
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:23.041
You hack, you fight, and you drive.
Parker, are you getting this?

561
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.166
- Three vehicles. Lots of guns.
- Yeah, I can tell by the bullets.

562
00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:39.625
- Stone!
- Sort of in the middle of something.

563
00:44:45.625 --> 00:44:46.625
Whoa!

564
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.458
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

565
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:52.000
Whoa!

566
00:44:53.208 --> 00:44:54.833
Oh, okay. Okay, you got it.

567
00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:05.125
Yang.

568
00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.083
- Got it.
- On your three o'clock.

569
00:45:08.625 --> 00:45:10.958
In three, two, one.

570
00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:32.833
Clip's out.

571
00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:55.500
- Are you trying to kill us?
- Pretty much the opposite, actually.

572
00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:06.125
Okay. This might be kind of intense.

573
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.500
Oh, this isn't good.

574
00:46:52.416 --> 00:46:54.333
- Stone, they're still coming.
- I know.

575
00:46:57.625 --> 00:46:58.833
Hold on.

576
00:47:33.916 --> 00:47:37.791
Well, I can't speak for the others,
but I... I think you're ready for the field.

577
00:47:49.625 --> 00:47:51.875
We need to get off the road
and lose this van.

578
00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:19.333
Rachel.

579
00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:20.958
Rachel.

580
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:24.291
Stone.

581
00:48:28.375 --> 00:48:29.458
Who the hell are you?

582
00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:35.916
It's complicated.

583
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.041
From where I'm sitting,

584
00:48:38.125 --> 00:48:40.750
a baby agent from IT
just took out an entire kill team.

585
00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:44.333
- Bailey, what's taking you so long?
- Shit.

586
00:48:44.916 --> 00:48:47.500
The Charter?
You're the... you're the bloody Charter?

587
00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:50.708
What, are you trying to
bring in Dhawan yourself?

588
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:52.833
Are you working with her?

589
00:48:55.916 --> 00:48:56.916
Answer him.

590
00:48:58.125 --> 00:48:59.125
You owe us that.

591
00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:02.458
We're after her too.

592
00:49:02.958 --> 00:49:04.250
Oh my God.

593
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:07.333
The Charter's real.

594
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.666
And you're one of them.

595
00:49:10.166 --> 00:49:12.166
I wish I could've told you more.

596
00:49:13.041 --> 00:49:14.625
But we all want the same thing.

597
00:49:15.583 --> 00:49:16.583
No, we don't.

598
00:49:22.416 --> 00:49:24.500
You're not the only one with a secret.

599
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.833
Did they mean something to you?

600
00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:36.333
Oh, come on, Rachel.
You're only playing a part, right?

601
00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:39.750
Who are you, Parker?

602
00:49:41.125 --> 00:49:42.292
Why don't you ask the Heart?

603
00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:48.833
If you wanted me dead,
you would have shot me first.

604
00:49:49.625 --> 00:49:51.833
Still a few things I need to know.

605
00:49:52.333 --> 00:49:54.708
About you, the Charter.

606
00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:56.958
But perhaps most of all,

607
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.666
I was looking forward to a fight.

608
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:11.791
Talk.

609
00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:20.666
Keya and I learned
that the Charter infiltrated MI6.

610
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:23.625
I had to flush out who.

611
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.166
At first, I thought it was Yang,

612
00:50:26.958 --> 00:50:28.750
but I was so pleased it was you.

613
00:50:29.958 --> 00:50:31.291
Keya's working for you?

614
00:50:34.708 --> 00:50:36.208
Your hand's shaking.

615
00:50:38.166 --> 00:50:39.458
You barely nicked me.

616
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.166
That was the point.

617
00:50:41.958 --> 00:50:42.958
Poison-tipped.

618
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:46.416
A little basic, I know,
but it hits the spot.

619
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.833
Looks like the paralysis is kicking in.

620
00:50:51.958 --> 00:50:54.666
I spent six years
looking for you people, Stone.

621
00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:57.583
Then fate brings you straight to me.

622
00:50:58.458 --> 00:50:59.791
You're a very good agent.

623
00:51:00.833 --> 00:51:04.833
But you were so busy letting a machine
think for you that you missed me.

624
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.500
Right here,

625
00:51:08.208 --> 00:51:09.541
in front of your face...

626
00:51:11.791 --> 00:51:12.791
the whole time.

627
00:51:16.375 --> 00:51:17.791
And Mulvaney?

628
00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:19.666
Oh...

629
00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:22.000
Well, he was tech-averse like me.

630
00:51:22.916 --> 00:51:24.333
Kept everything up here.

631
00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:29.416
So, Keya and I set up
our casino of blood to lure him in.

632
00:51:31.083 --> 00:51:33.458
We needed to have a little chat
about the Heart.

633
00:51:33.541 --> 00:51:34.958
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

634
00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:38.166
Talk.

635
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:39.250
Yeah, I--

636
00:51:40.541 --> 00:51:43.625
The Heart is
what gives the Charter its power.

637
00:51:44.125 --> 00:51:47.333
It's the most formidable weapon
you never knew existed.

638
00:51:47.833 --> 00:51:49.875
It can hack into anything, anywhere.

639
00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:55.458
Cell phones, power grids, the banks,
governments, military, health records.

640
00:51:56.583 --> 00:51:57.750
Your secrets.

641
00:51:58.583 --> 00:52:01.083
It knows you
better than you know yourself.

642
00:52:01.708 --> 00:52:02.750
It's determinism.

643
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:07.708
With access to trillions of data points
at once, its modeling is so accurate

644
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.250
it can predict the future.

645
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.166
The Heart is knowledge and power.

646
00:52:14.333 --> 00:52:17.416
It can crash a market
or drop a plane out of the sky.

647
00:52:18.166 --> 00:52:22.125
Who needs to steal a nuclear bomb
when you can control them all?

648
00:52:23.625 --> 00:52:24.875
If you own the Heart...

649
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.833
you own the world.

650
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:35.750
Where is it?

651
00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.833
Where... is it?

652
00:52:42.208 --> 00:52:44.291
Only a Charter member could tell you.

653
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.458
The poison's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

654
00:52:49.916 --> 00:52:51.166
Cold War paralytic.

655
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.500
My chemist does all the classics.

656
00:52:55.416 --> 00:52:56.625
Like cyanide.

657
00:53:08.208 --> 00:53:09.458
Oh, relax, Rachel.

658
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:15.041
Killing you is not part of the plan.
We need you to deliver a package first.

659
00:53:18.666 --> 00:53:21.458
I've loved working with you, Rachel.

660
00:53:22.458 --> 00:53:23.458
Hand on heart.

661
00:54:17.958 --> 00:54:18.958
Stone?

662
00:54:21.375 --> 00:54:22.375
Stone?

663
00:54:22.708 --> 00:54:24.625
She's awake. She's awake.

664
00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:30.375
Hold her here. Hold her down.

665
00:54:32.416 --> 00:54:33.416
Oh shit.

666
00:54:36.208 --> 00:54:38.625
Take this. Help me. Help me here.

667
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:40.583
Keep her steady.

668
00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:43.916
Cholinest-- Cholines--

669
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.083
Wait. Get me atropine. Five mils.

670
00:54:46.166 --> 00:54:47.708
It's cholinesterase.

671
00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:48.958
Jack. Jack.

672
00:54:49.041 --> 00:54:51.125
- We've been breached.
- How?

673
00:54:51.791 --> 00:54:54.916
It's... There's a Trojan
in our system delivered wirelessly.

674
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.834
Chewing through security
like it isn't there.

675
00:54:56.875 --> 00:54:57.875
Restrict all access.

676
00:54:57.958 --> 00:55:01.000
Nomad, I've tried. No-go.
They're trying to access the Heart.

677
00:55:01.083 --> 00:55:03.333
From where? We're walled off.

678
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.791
It's a weak wireless signal.
It's coming from...

679
00:55:10.791 --> 00:55:11.958
inside the building.

680
00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:14.333
Stone.

681
00:55:14.416 --> 00:55:16.375
Quickly.
We need to monitor her airway.

682
00:55:17.375 --> 00:55:19.166
- Go ahead.
- Hold her.

683
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:20.791
Press down.

684
00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:23.166
That didn't do it.

685
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:36.083
Stone.

686
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.333
What's happened?
I need to know what's happened.

687
00:55:40.416 --> 00:55:41.875
How long were we compromised?

688
00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:45.166
Three minutes and 45 seconds.
Running a system check now.

689
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:47.625
We need to know what they accessed.
Is the Locker safe?

690
00:55:47.708 --> 00:55:48.916
Boom.

691
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.583
The Locker is still flying high

692
00:55:50.666 --> 00:55:53.083
with the Heart safe inside,
85,000 feet up.

693
00:55:54.041 --> 00:55:56.043
No one's getting up there
without a space shuttle.

694
00:55:56.083 --> 00:55:58.625
It's passing over the Atlantic,
towards West Africa.

695
00:55:58.708 --> 00:56:01.083
And the other suits,
can they still access the Heart?

696
00:56:01.166 --> 00:56:04.041
- Looks like it-- Jesus.
- What?

697
00:56:04.125 --> 00:56:06.791
There've been
100,000 attempts to access files.

698
00:56:06.875 --> 00:56:10.208
Clubs team are analyzing the data,
but looks like our security held.

699
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:12.083
We need to shut it all down now.

700
00:56:12.916 --> 00:56:16.250
- Shut what down? The Heart?
- Until we know what they've done.

701
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.833
We have no idea what they're capable of.

702
00:56:18.916 --> 00:56:21.458
Don't need to shut it down
to find out what they've done.

703
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:24.208
- We'd be harming ourselves.
- We don't know. She's not stupid.

704
00:56:24.291 --> 00:56:26.875
- And neither are we.
- Sure about that? Because right now--

705
00:56:26.958 --> 00:56:28.666
Rachel. Rachel. He's right.

706
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:29.750
We'll sort it.

707
00:56:30.375 --> 00:56:31.375
"We"?

708
00:56:32.125 --> 00:56:34.208
A word in private. Now.

709
00:56:44.041 --> 00:56:47.291
I told you. I knew Keya
was playing us, playing the Heart.

710
00:56:47.375 --> 00:56:49.500
No, you didn't. No, you didn't
You had a feeling.

711
00:56:49.583 --> 00:56:52.500
Nothing... nothing concrete,
nothing actionable.

712
00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:55.541
A mood, a notion, a hunch, a bollocks.
We don't trade in those.

713
00:56:55.625 --> 00:56:56.958
I knew she wouldn't be there.

714
00:56:57.041 --> 00:56:59.375
You ignored the Heart,
and you went back in.

715
00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:01.333
- To save my team.
- They weren't your team.

716
00:57:01.416 --> 00:57:03.750
They died anyway.
You going back made sure of that.

717
00:57:06.833 --> 00:57:08.041
You blew your cover.

718
00:57:09.208 --> 00:57:11.916
If you'd left when we told you to,
Parker would've followed you,

719
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.375
we'd have caught him,
and Yang and Bailey might be alive.

720
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.625
- I should've just listened to the Heart?
- Yes.

721
00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:29.958
The Charter exists for one reason.

722
00:57:31.166 --> 00:57:34.458
To maximize lives saved.
That's the only moral metric there is.

723
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:38.291
And it's a calculation.
A pure and objective calculation.

724
00:57:38.375 --> 00:57:39.958
Made for us by a machine.

725
00:57:40.041 --> 00:57:42.125
Have you forgotten how radical that is?

726
00:57:44.083 --> 00:57:47.708
It doesn't mean
that what we do is easy or feels nice.

727
00:57:47.791 --> 00:57:50.835
You'll have the voices of those people
in your head for the rest of your life.

728
00:57:50.875 --> 00:57:54.541
And you will never
not feel responsible for them ever.

729
00:57:55.916 --> 00:57:58.166
But the end justifies the means.

730
00:58:01.333 --> 00:58:04.708
I spent every day with Parker
for a year and didn't see it coming.

731
00:58:06.458 --> 00:58:07.458
No.

732
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:09.416
Neither did the Heart.

733
00:58:13.458 --> 00:58:14.791
So, what do we do now?

734
00:58:14.875 --> 00:58:16.708
I'm...

735
00:58:19.958 --> 00:58:22.791
Gonna make some tough choices,
and this is the first one.

736
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:25.166
I'm standing you down, Rachel.

737
00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:27.541
Go home. Get some rest.

738
00:58:27.625 --> 00:58:29.875
Keep your head down.
Don't do anything stupid.

739
00:58:31.833 --> 00:58:32.916
You can't do this.

740
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.125
You're compromised.

741
00:58:35.208 --> 00:58:36.875
Parker knows you. Dhawan knows you.

742
00:58:36.958 --> 00:58:40.750
And the other Kings, quite rightly...
don't know if you can be trusted.

743
00:58:41.375 --> 00:58:42.375
And you?

744
00:58:44.708 --> 00:58:48.375
I want to protect what we've spent
20 years trying to build.

745
00:58:51.166 --> 00:58:52.208
So, I'm just out.

746
00:58:54.458 --> 00:58:55.875
It's about the greater good.

747
00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.625
It's nothing personal.

748
00:58:59.125 --> 00:59:00.125
No.

749
00:59:01.375 --> 00:59:02.875
I'm starting to see that.

750
00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:34.166
Hello?

751
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.500
- Stone? Wrong number. Wait.
- It's for me.

752
00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:39.041
That's my phone. I--

753
00:59:39.541 --> 00:59:43.250
So, why is a Charter agent
riding around all alone,

754
00:59:43.333 --> 00:59:45.125
just hours after being poisoned?

755
00:59:45.208 --> 00:59:48.666
Doesn't feel like they're taking care of
their most valuable player.

756
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:49.750
What do you want?

757
00:59:50.333 --> 00:59:51.666
Don't be a sore loser.

758
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:55.333
I bet you used to think we were so alike.
Now you know I'm better.

759
00:59:55.416 --> 00:59:58.125
Better? You killed my friends.

760
00:59:59.333 --> 01:00:00.333
What?

761
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.250
You didn't know, huh?

762
01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.958
Well, I told you this wasn't a game, Keya.

763
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:06.958
Heart or no Heart,

764
01:00:08.166 --> 01:00:09.333
I'm coming for you.

765
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.250
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

766
01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:25.666
Nomad. Great spot.

767
01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:36.125
All four kings in the same room.
How long has it been, three years?

768
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.041
Not long enough.

769
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:43.583
So, who is this Parker,
and how did we miss him?

770
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.083
Career intelligence agent.
Born in Belfast, lives alone.

771
01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:51.708
He has no one he cares for.
There's nothing much to live for.

772
01:00:51.791 --> 01:00:56.750
He has devoted his life
to a country that sees him as expendable.

773
01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:59.833
Okay. We get it.
All that is fuel for the fire.

774
01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:03.625
- But it won't burn without a spark.
- I was getting to that.

775
01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:08.875
I had to lean extremely hard on
some very old friends for this.

776
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.750
Chechnya, December 2015.

777
01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:15.041
What's this?

778
01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:19.083
It was before your time.
Before the Heart, for that matter.

779
01:01:19.166 --> 01:01:24.291
A Chechen warlord was given free rein
by the Chechen and Russian governments.

780
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The West, as always, were
looking the other way.

781
01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:32.041
He was wiping out whole villages,
trying to stamp out dissent.

782
01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:35.333
But... what's this got to do with Parker?

783
01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:37.291
He was there.

784
01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:44.125
Different identity. No electronic records.

785
01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:47.000
But he was there, with MI6,

786
01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:50.000
delivering weapons
to take the warlord out.

787
01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:54.250
Any sign of them?

788
01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:57.416
You got an ETA yet?

789
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.500
They'll be here.

790
01:02:06.333 --> 01:02:07.916
We intercepted a communication.

791
01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:09.958
It was a trap.

792
01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:21.916
Intelligence came through from MI6
that their entire team had been executed.

793
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.791
We thought there was no one left to save.

794
01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:28.333
The region was a tinderbox
on the verge of full civil war.

795
01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:31.500
We couldn't let those weapons
fall into the warlord's hands.

796
01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:33.833
It would have cost thousands of lives.

797
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.416
We had a drone that was stationed
overhead armed with missiles.

798
01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.333
I gave the order myself.

799
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:59.458
We made it look like a rebel force
had ordered the drone strike.

800
01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:01.875
MI6 buried their mistake.

801
01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:04.791
No report, no investigation.

802
01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:08.916
No record of the personnel
who had been involved.

803
01:03:09.708 --> 01:03:11.416
We thought everyone had died.

804
01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.041
Until a few hours ago.

805
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:18.041
What a mess.

806
01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:23.958
So, you think... he knows it was us?

807
01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:26.708
I think that's a safe assumption.

808
01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:32.041
And now he wants to destroy the Charter.

809
01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.541
You killed Bailey and Yang?

810
01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:42.625
That wasn't the plan.

811
01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:45.875
You stick to the tech
and leave strategy to me, okay?

812
01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:50.125
Let me remind you, we're partners. Okay?
So if you want me to do my job,

813
01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:52.916
you have to tell me
what you're doing before you do it.

814
01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.500
Let me remind you,
the Charter don't give two shits

815
01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.250
about people like Bailey and Yang.

816
01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.875
So, if you want us to succeed,
you shouldn't either.

817
01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:56.875
Hey, Barry.

818
01:04:57.583 --> 01:04:59.375
I'm a friend of your dad's.

819
01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:04.041
It's okay.

820
01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:15.750
I've got you.

821
01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:48.208
The camera.

822
01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:56.041
She hacked into the camera feed.

823
01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.208
Let's see how well she covered her tracks.

824
01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:19.125
There she is.

825
01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:21.791
What's in the desert, Keya?

826
01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:24.833
I'm guessing it's not the nightlife.

827
01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.750
Are you shitting me?

828
01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:32.208
West Africa. The Locker.

829
01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:37.583
You ever done this before?
Choppered in at over 40,000 feet?

830
01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:40.041
Trick question. No one has.

831
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:43.708
But my mama always said
I could do anything.

832
01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:45.958
How long do we have
before the Locker descends?

833
01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:47.750
Eleven hours and seven minutes.

834
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:51.291
At which point,
the Charter will realize what's going on.

835
01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:55.583
It'll take nine minutes and 26 seconds
for the Locker to drop to 40,000 feet.

836
01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:58.250
We'll have about eight minutes
to get in, take the Heart,

837
01:06:58.333 --> 01:07:00.167
and get out again
before they regain control.

838
01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:01.250
Very precise.

839
01:07:02.375 --> 01:07:03.375
You're sure?

840
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:05.791
No. I'll be sure when it descends.

841
01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:10.083
If they found my code, it won't descend,
they'll be waiting for us, and we all die.

842
01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.166
- Hey.
- Good morning.

843
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:20.250
What time is it?

844
01:07:20.666 --> 01:07:22.250
Uh, it's nearly seven.

845
01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:23.375
What? Oh shit.

846
01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:24.708
Any luck?

847
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:28.083
Uh... nothing. But they need to
pop their heads up at some point.

848
01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:30.000
I'll see if they--

849
01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:37.291
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

850
01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:40.208
Get Nomad now! Get Nomad now!

851
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.541
Just get me up there. I'll do the rest.

852
01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:50.666
Nomad will string me up for this.

853
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:52.083
Tell her I stole your keys.

854
01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:56.583
You'll just have to trust me.

855
01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:03.916
Okay. Moment of truth.

856
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.125
How will we know if it's worked?

857
01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:10.875
Would you look at that?

858
01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:21.583
The Locker has been dropped
15,000 feet in the last two minutes.

859
01:08:21.666 --> 01:08:22.666
Still descending.

860
01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:25.708
Security systems are all down.
I'm locked out.

861
01:08:26.208 --> 01:08:29.791
- How is that even possible? Another hack?
- No. No.

862
01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:32.083
This is why they did it the first time.

863
01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:34.416
It's been lying dormant
in our system until now.

864
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.959
- Can you override it?
- I'm trying.

865
01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:07.541
The air lock's been breached.

866
01:09:07.625 --> 01:09:09.750
Contact every Charter agent in the region.

867
01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.541
There's no one within 500 miles.

868
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.083
Approaching coordinates
in five, four, three--

869
01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:23.375
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- Tell me about it.

870
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:42.500
- We have a something approaching fast.
- A something?

871
01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:44.333
- Thirty seconds out.
- What is it?

872
01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:50.250
I think-- I think it's a someone.

873
01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:53.166
Who is it?

874
01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:55.583
Go in closer.

875
01:10:00.416 --> 01:10:01.416
Is that--?

876
01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:03.416
It's Stone.

877
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:17.208
I have to descend. Lower the rotor speed.

878
01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:19.916
Copy that.
See you in seven minutes.

879
01:10:30.583 --> 01:10:32.208
She's not gonna make it.

880
01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:44.875
Woo!

881
01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:52.083
Look who it is.

882
01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:54.583
- I'm gonna need a minute.
- No!

883
01:10:54.666 --> 01:10:57.750
The ship's lining is filled with hydrogen.
One spark, and we're all dead.

884
01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.000
No way to get hold of her.

885
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.041
Come on, Rachel.

886
01:11:25.541 --> 01:11:26.625
Come on.

887
01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:52.041
It's over, Keya.

888
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:56.250
For who?

889
01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:04.291
I told you not to get out of the van.

890
01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:06.541
You also told me to have some fun.

891
01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:46.708
It's gone.

892
01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:53.708
And now you answer to me.

893
01:12:55.708 --> 01:12:56.958
We've lost the Heart.

894
01:13:01.583 --> 01:13:02.583
Not yet.

895
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:21.041
Parker. Ninety seconds. Let's go.

896
01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:25.166
Shame about your parachute.
You'll be needing that.

897
01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:49.291
Get off me!

898
01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:54.875
No, no, no, no, no!

899
01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:00.668
- Get after them.
- Impossible.

900
01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:03.416
We'll be lucky to get to base as it is.

901
01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:19.875
Get away!

902
01:15:22.791 --> 01:15:24.125
Leave me alone!

903
01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:50.000
Morning, sunshine.

904
01:16:53.583 --> 01:16:55.292
Give me that thing before somebody gets--

905
01:16:59.208 --> 01:17:00.208
I don't think so.

906
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:04.625
So, here's what's gonna happen.

907
01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:07.708
You're gonna secret-agent
our way back to civilization,

908
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:10.750
and I'm gonna follow
three steps behind you with this gun.

909
01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:13.458
- Where's the Heart?
- Parker has it.

910
01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:17.583
But I encrypted it to my biometrics,
so it's useless without me.

911
01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:19.666
Come on, get up.

912
01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:26.000
If I shoot you now, all this is over.

913
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.166
Show you the same mercy
you showed Bailey and Yang.

914
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.083
It's the logical play, Rachel.

915
01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:39.958
It's what the Heart would tell you to do.

916
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.041
I'm not like you.

917
01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:48.625
On your feet.

918
01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.458
We need to keep moving.

919
01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.833
So, what's the plan, Keya?

920
01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:22.000
Trying to get even with Niam Kharche
for kicking you out of the penthouse?

921
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.125
Right. You think you know everything.

922
01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:27.250
I bet the Heart
told you that he adopted me,

923
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:30.208
lifted me out of nothing.
But did it tell you why?

924
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:38.041
Kharche used my parents like lab rats
in a medical trial, and it killed them.

925
01:18:39.666 --> 01:18:42.750
He covered everything up and took me in
thinking he was doing me a favor,

926
01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:45.083
but I let him think that
because I knew one day,

927
01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:48.333
I'd be strong enough to make him pay
for what he did to my parents.

928
01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:50.708
So, you get to tear the whole world down?

929
01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:52.208
Oh, this is not just for me.

930
01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:54.000
It's for people like me.

931
01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:56.666
Parker's gonna destroy the Charter.

932
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:59.666
I've got my whole naughty list,
and we're going to expose them all.

933
01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.208
With no thought of what comes next.

934
01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:05.208
You're a child.

935
01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:07.708
And you think the Charter's any better?

936
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.583
Just because they saved you
doesn't make them good.

937
01:19:12.125 --> 01:19:13.791
You think I didn't look into you?

938
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:17.666
How many schools
did you get kicked out of?

939
01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:20.166
Seven? Eight?

940
01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:24.000
Always a rebel. Always a problem.

941
01:19:24.791 --> 01:19:27.208
Violent, alone, helpless.

942
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:29.168
- Stop.
- Until the Charter comes along, right?

943
01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:31.833
And gives you that discipline
that you so clearly crave.

944
01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:34.083
But did they take you in
because you were good?

945
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:36.875
- Or because you were broken?
- Enough.

946
01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:41.958
Maybe I was broken.

947
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:47.083
But there's a woman I know only as Nomad.

948
01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:49.208
She rescued me, trained me,

949
01:19:50.708 --> 01:19:53.958
showed me what's possible
when there's someone watching your back.

950
01:19:58.416 --> 01:19:59.416
Where is she now?

951
01:20:01.416 --> 01:20:02.416
Let's go.

952
01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:06.875
Parker's coming for you, and I wanna have
a bigger gun when he shows up.

953
01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:34.916
They're headed for us.

954
01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:37.500
Maybe it's Parker.

955
01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.666
It's definitely not the Charter.

956
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:45.750
Mercenaries?

957
01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:50.375
Okay, let's just, um,
give them a good cover story.

958
01:20:50.458 --> 01:20:53.833
They'll keep us alive for ransom.
We reel them in, and then bam.

959
01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.833
Just to be clear,
the "bam" is for you to take them out.

960
01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:02.541
Yeah, I get that.

Come with me.

979
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.041
She got away.

980
01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:21.375
That wasn't the deal.

981
01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:25.375
Killing her wasn't the deal either.
You have to pay me now.

982
01:24:26.958 --> 01:24:27.958
The deal changed.

983
01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:30.625
You're a hard woman to find.

984
01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:35.583
Six of Hearts.

985
01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:37.583
Nomad sends her best.

986
01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:01.416
Dhawan is back with Parker.
I slipped her a tracker.

987
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.208
They're heading north. Looping you in now.

988
01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:07.166
Hi, Rachel.

989
01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:10.750
Nice to hear your voice.
I was a bit worried about you.

990
01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:12.875
Were you?

991
01:26:14.333 --> 01:26:17.250
Okay, got her.
They're heading towards Iceland.

992
01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:21.833
I take it I'm no longer compromised.

993
01:26:22.333 --> 01:26:24.666
Well, they have the Heart,
so we're all compromised.

994
01:26:25.416 --> 01:26:28.708
Parker's coming after the Charter,
so we're heading to a secure location.

995
01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:30.166
Clubs is assembling a team.

996
01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:32.916
We'll make sure they're on the ground
by the time you arrive.

997
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.291
And if we're too late?

998
01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:36.291
Just get there as fast as you can.

999
01:26:36.375 --> 01:26:39.750
If they get the Heart online,
God knows what they're capable of.

1000
01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:40.833
I'm on my way.

1001
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:16.500
It's not impregnable,
but it's the best we've got.

1002
01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:21.291
If the Heart wants to find us, it will.

1003
01:27:27.541 --> 01:27:30.000
Will this hunk of junk make it to Iceland?

1004
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:31.583
Hell yeah.

1005
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.958
Nice trick you pulled
with the facial recognition yesterday.

1006
01:27:47.708 --> 01:27:49.583
Trying to put a lock on our new toy.

1007
01:27:50.583 --> 01:27:52.541
Would you come back for me if I hadn't?

1008
01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:54.833
We're a team, Keya.

1009
01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:57.375
Don't do it again.

1010
01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.458
I think I have it.

1011
01:28:09.541 --> 01:28:13.000
I know where they're going.
Reykjavik University computer lab.

1012
01:28:13.083 --> 01:28:16.166
It has a cryo-storage facility,
several floors of servers.

1013
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:17.834
The tracker's heading straight for it.

1014
01:28:20.875 --> 01:28:23.541
See, Keya, don't say
I don't keep my promises.

1015
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.666
Okay, be ready.
You know your instructions.

1016
01:28:28.166 --> 01:28:30.541
Couple of minutes,
we'll be up and running.

1017
01:29:13.666 --> 01:29:14.666
Are we up?

1018
01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:19.541
We're up.

1019
01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:42.875
Is this your naughty list?

1020
01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:47.166
Emails, texts, bank accounts. The Heart's
using my algorithm to sort through it all.

1021
01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:49.916
So, we can find anyone?
Gain access to anything?

1022
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Greatest skeleton key in the world.

1023
01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:54.583
Show me.

1024
01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:01.875
There it is.

1025
01:30:02.666 --> 01:30:06.166
Evidence of Kharche's years of experiments
on innocents across the country.

1026
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:08.833
That's the truth... for the world to see.

1027
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:12.750
That's impressive.
But let's see what else this thing can do.

1028
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:14.333
Find me the Kings.

1029
01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:17.458
What are you doing?

1030
01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:22.833
Nancy Morrison.
King of Diamonds. Ex-CIA.

1031
01:30:23.333 --> 01:30:26.541
The Heart tells us she's heading to
a safe house with her family.

1032
01:30:27.791 --> 01:30:28.791
Drop the lift.

1033
01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:31.250
Are you serious?

1034
01:30:33.041 --> 01:30:34.458
No. Do--

1035
01:30:49.666 --> 01:30:50.833
You're welcome.

1036
01:30:50.916 --> 01:30:52.750
Hang on. I have another one.

1037
01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:56.208
I think you're gonna like this, boss.

1038
01:30:56.708 --> 01:31:00.625
An unidentified military plane landed
at a private airfield 33 minutes ago.

1039
01:31:02.583 --> 01:31:03.583
There.

1040
01:31:05.666 --> 01:31:10.125
Jiang Hsu. Served 35 years
in Chinese State Security Service.

1041
01:31:10.208 --> 01:31:12.291
The King of Clubs is here in Iceland.

1042
01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:14.083
Even better. Where is he now?

1043
01:31:25.833 --> 01:31:26.833
Two minutes out.

1044
01:31:26.875 --> 01:31:29.375
Sending the plans now.
Stone is on her way.

1045
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:36.708
We don't have time to wait.
Tell her to follow us in.

1046
01:31:39.666 --> 01:31:41.375
Any news of Spades or Hearts?

1047
01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:42.750
Nothing yet.

1048
01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:47.833
There were other people in that elevator.
In that lobby.

1049
01:31:48.958 --> 01:31:49.958
Calm down, Keya.

1050
01:31:51.083 --> 01:31:55.708
You said we were going to expose Kharche
and then the Charter, not murder them.

1051
01:31:55.791 --> 01:32:00.041
The King of Hearts with her team.
They're in a bunker outside of London.

1052
01:32:01.041 --> 01:32:02.041
Good.

1053
01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:04.250
Take them out.

1054
01:32:08.333 --> 01:32:09.666
We're approaching now.

1055
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:12.416
- We'll see you on the other side.
- You're going in with them?

1056
01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.208
I ordered the strike on Parker.
It's only fair.

1057
01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:18.958
You know... I would have made
the same call in Chechnya.

1058
01:32:19.041 --> 01:32:20.208
Thanks. The right--

1059
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.416
I've lost contact.

1060
01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.291
The Heart's online.

1061
01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.500
No, no, no, no.

1062
01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:41.291
We're locked in.

1063
01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:48.458
Oh God. They've shut off
our ventilation system.

1064
01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:50.083
No, no, no, no.

1065
01:32:55.041 --> 01:32:56.583
Jack, how long we got?

1066
01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:02.791
At this rate, about an hour
and we're out of oxygen.

1067
01:33:06.791 --> 01:33:10.000
The Charter never worries about
who gets in their way. Neither will we.

1068
01:33:10.083 --> 01:33:12.833
King of Hearts is locked in.
They'll be dead in an hour.

1069
01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:17.000
- You have to stop this, please.
- Someone has to control this power, Keya.

1070
01:33:17.083 --> 01:33:19.000
- Why not us?
- This is not what we agreed.

1071
01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:22.333
You're still not seeing
the bigger picture.

1072
01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:25.333
This isn't about
some pissy little grievance you had

1073
01:33:25.416 --> 01:33:27.250
with the bad man
who killed your mom and dad.

1074
01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:29.041
This is about power.

1075
01:33:29.541 --> 01:33:34.291
Concentrated in the hands of the few,
of the very few who could use it for good,

1076
01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:37.041
who could actually make a change,
but they don't.

1077
01:33:41.541 --> 01:33:45.166
At this moment, we are mining
trillions of pieces of data.

1078
01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:48.500
In a matter of hours,
I will be able to take down

1079
01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:50.458
the remaining members of the Charter.

1080
01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:55.291
We've been used
and manipulated our whole lives.

1081
01:33:56.375 --> 01:33:58.250
Now it's time for us to take control.

1082
01:34:24.083 --> 01:34:25.083
Go.

1083
01:34:33.208 --> 01:34:35.875
Clubs team are inside
the university building.

1084
01:34:37.375 --> 01:34:38.875
What... are you doing?

1085
01:34:40.916 --> 01:34:43.125
You wanna know
how great men get power, Keya?

1086
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.458
It's not because they earn it...

1087
01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:49.625
or because they deserve it.

1088
01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:53.416
It is because when the moment comes,

1089
01:34:54.833 --> 01:34:55.833
they take it.

1090
01:35:09.125 --> 01:35:10.541
Stone is one minute out.

1091
01:35:12.208 --> 01:35:13.833
In position. We're all set.

1092
01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:20.833
She's approaching the university.

1093
01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:41.041
Stone, you need to get out now.

1094
01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:42.458
I don't have long.

1095
01:35:42.541 --> 01:35:43.375
Keya?

1096
01:35:43.458 --> 01:35:45.916
I have a failsafe uploading.
It will disable the Heart.

1097
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.916
They won't be able
to access it without me.

1098
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.125
I'm outside. But you already know that.

1099
01:35:51.208 --> 01:35:53.458
No, you're not. It's a trap.

1100
01:35:54.541 --> 01:35:55.666
I found your tracker.

1101
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:59.083
The lab is a decoy.
You need to get your team out now.

1102
01:36:00.083 --> 01:36:02.583
- Why should I believe you?
- Because you were right.

1103
01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:06.083
Okay? You told me about Parker,
and you were right about everything.

1104
01:36:06.583 --> 01:36:08.708
My parents would have never wanted this.

1105
01:36:08.791 --> 01:36:10.750
Just please listen to me.

1106
01:36:10.833 --> 01:36:12.791
Get your team out of there right now.

1107
01:36:22.458 --> 01:36:24.625
- Tell me where you are.
- Okay.

1108
01:36:24.708 --> 01:36:28.083
I'm sending you my coordinates.
I'll leave the back door open.

1109
01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:31.250
Shit.

1110
01:36:41.708 --> 01:36:44.375
I'm Nine of Hearts.
I need your radio.

1111
01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:49.625
Go.

1112
01:36:52.375 --> 01:36:55.333
This is Nine of Hearts.
Get out of there. It's a trap.

1113
01:37:00.666 --> 01:37:03.833
Do you hear me?
She found the tracker. Get out of there.

1114
01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:11.583
Do you hear me?

1115
01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:14.333
Yeah... I hear you.

1116
01:37:46.291 --> 01:37:47.333
What's going on?

1117
01:37:48.333 --> 01:37:49.625
Where is she?

1118
01:37:49.708 --> 01:37:51.916
What has she done?

1119
01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:54.166
- How long to fix it?
- Oh.

1120
01:37:54.791 --> 01:37:57.500
I-- Could be minutes. Could be hours.

1121
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.541
You have until I get back.

1122
01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:08.083
The door won't move.

1123
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.750
Damn it!

1124
01:38:10.833 --> 01:38:13.166
There must be
an emergency override system.

1125
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:15.041
We must have missed something.

1126
01:38:15.125 --> 01:38:17.500
Jack, is there any way
we can get hold of Stone?

1127
01:38:17.583 --> 01:38:19.541
No. No comms. We're still offline.

1128
01:38:21.916 --> 01:38:24.250
Maybe-- Maybe try the landline.

1129
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:39.916
Okay. Okay.

1130
01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:10.750
- Stone, thank God. Where are you?
- Clubs are dead.

1131
01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:13.916
University was a trap.

1132
01:39:15.791 --> 01:39:17.083
I have new intel.

1133
01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:19.083
A new location.

1134
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.208
We've-- We've lost Clubs?

1135
01:39:23.083 --> 01:39:24.083
What new intel?

1136
01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.541
Keya. She shut down the Heart.

1137
01:39:28.708 --> 01:39:32.125
- How do you know she's not playing you?
- I don't.

1138
01:39:35.625 --> 01:39:37.833
We're gonna die in less than an hour.

1139
01:39:38.375 --> 01:39:40.583
- They shut down our air supply.
- What?

1140
01:39:40.666 --> 01:39:43.625
- She shut down our air supply.
- Parker did.

1141
01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:45.125
I believe her, Nomad.

1142
01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:48.041
I'd be dead too
if I hadn't listened to her.

1143
01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:50.750
I trust her, and you need to trust me.

1144
01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:55.250
Fifty minutes.

1145
01:39:57.625 --> 01:39:58.875
I can work with that.

1146
01:40:02.458 --> 01:40:03.458
I'll see you.

1147
01:40:10.583 --> 01:40:11.583
You too.

1148
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.416
♪ A little time to think things over ♪

1149
01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:32.958
♪ In my life ♪

1150
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:34.750

1151
01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:03.041

1152
01:42:05.541 --> 01:42:09.125

- ♪ I want you to show me ♪

1153
01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:10.750
Sorry, I need your truck.

1154
01:42:19.541 --> 01:42:21.416
I know you're in here, Keya.

1155
01:42:25.125 --> 01:42:27.125
You know, you still have a choice.

1156
01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:31.958
You can still be a part of this.

1157
01:42:38.333 --> 01:42:40.458
You're only delaying the inevitable.

1158
01:43:17.708 --> 01:43:20.208
- Would you like me to wait?
- Definitely no.

1159
01:43:20.833 --> 01:43:21.833
But thanks!

1160
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:47.291
Come on, Keya.

1161
01:44:07.833 --> 01:44:09.083
Settle down now.

1162
01:44:09.916 --> 01:44:10.916
Conserve air.

1163
01:44:42.166 --> 01:44:43.500
Move.

1164
01:44:47.125 --> 01:44:48.666
Get the Heart back online.

1165
01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:50.416
Do it!

1166
01:44:53.708 --> 01:44:54.708
Get up.

1167
01:44:55.041 --> 01:44:56.041
Get up!

1168
01:45:04.916 --> 01:45:06.750
Right. Where do we start?

1169
01:45:07.833 --> 01:45:08.666
Fingers?

1170
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:10.750
No, we'll be needing those. Knees?

1171
01:45:10.833 --> 01:45:12.666
Yeah.

1172
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:13.750
Last chance.

1173
01:45:14.958 --> 01:45:16.666
Okay, I'll do it.

1174
01:45:19.208 --> 01:45:20.208
Go on.

1175
01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.333
I need to get back in there.

1176
01:45:24.291 --> 01:45:27.750
The Heart has to be disconnected
and reconnected again to the servers.

1177
01:45:27.833 --> 01:45:31.541
Any interference, the system
automatically shuts down. You know that.

1178
01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:34.291
Move.

1179
01:46:01.833 --> 01:46:05.416
This doesn't end well for you, Stone.
Take another step, and she's dead.

1180
01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:08.625
- I don't care. I'm here for you.
- Bullshit.

1181
01:46:09.458 --> 01:46:11.333
You and I know that without this one,

1182
01:46:11.416 --> 01:46:14.291
the Heart stays down
and everyone inside that bunker dies,

1183
01:46:14.375 --> 01:46:16.291
unless, of course, they're dead already.

1184
01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:20.333
I have the Heart, and I have the Kings.
That's a winning hand.

1185
01:46:31.416 --> 01:46:32.791
Okay. I'll put it down.

1186
01:46:39.416 --> 01:46:41.708
Good girl. Now, kick it away.

1187
01:46:44.875 --> 01:46:46.125
Tell me this, though.

1188
01:46:47.041 --> 01:46:48.375
What's your point, hm?

1189
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.666
And why do you have to
kill them to make it?

1190
01:46:52.416 --> 01:46:55.916
I've served my entire life,
Rachel, and none of it mattered.

1191
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.666
The world is still in chaos.

1192
01:46:59.208 --> 01:47:01.416
The Heart has the power
to change everything.

1193
01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:05.583
But the Charter are using it
to keep things exactly as they are.

1194
01:47:05.666 --> 01:47:09.291
You don't wanna change anything.
You just wanna be the one in charge.

1195
01:47:09.791 --> 01:47:12.708
First thing you did
with all that power was kill people.

1196
01:47:13.333 --> 01:47:16.625
The problem
with men like you, Parker,

1197
01:47:17.125 --> 01:47:20.333
is that your power is only ever based on
threats and violence.

1198
01:47:20.833 --> 01:47:24.500
And when you brutalize everyone
around you, even your own team...

1199
01:47:25.833 --> 01:47:28.708
you'll never have
the one thing I know I always will.

1200
01:47:31.875 --> 01:47:32.875
Yeah?

1201
01:47:33.625 --> 01:47:35.125
And what is that, Rachel?

1202
01:47:36.916 --> 01:47:38.666
Someone to watch my back.

1203
01:49:30.041 --> 01:49:32.875
Maybe in the next life.

1204
01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:36.125
See you when I get there.

1205
01:50:33.416 --> 01:50:35.458
Nomad, tell me you're okay.

1206
01:50:42.875 --> 01:50:44.375
Is everyone still with us?

1207
01:50:47.166 --> 01:50:50.791
Yeah, yeah.

1208
01:50:58.458 --> 01:51:00.208
It's good to hear from you, Stone.

1209
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I knew I would.

1210
01:51:30.958 --> 01:51:31.958
Hey, Barry.

1211
01:51:46.041 --> 01:51:47.041
What's this?

1212
01:51:47.375 --> 01:51:48.250
I don't know.

1213
01:51:48.333 --> 01:51:49.666
It's beautiful.

1214
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:51.625
But what is it? Who's it from?

1215
01:52:06.833 --> 01:52:08.083
Looking good.

1216
01:52:09.375 --> 01:52:12.833
I decided to embrace the cliché
and use my time in jail to get ripped.

1217
01:52:14.875 --> 01:52:16.250
You've had worse goals.

1218
01:52:17.541 --> 01:52:18.875
So my lawyers tell me.

1219
01:52:21.708 --> 01:52:23.291
And you? Back with the Charter?

1220
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.916
Yeah, I'm back with the Charter.

1221
01:52:29.625 --> 01:52:31.041
But on two conditions.

1222
01:52:33.083 --> 01:52:34.750
The Heart's an amazing tool.

1223
01:52:35.708 --> 01:52:36.958
But that's all it is.

1224
01:52:38.125 --> 01:52:41.875
If we only follow the odds, we'll
never do anything in spite of the odds.

1225
01:52:42.875 --> 01:52:45.416
And what if the odds
tell you to do nothing?

1226
01:52:47.458 --> 01:52:48.958
That's when they send me.

1227
01:52:53.083 --> 01:52:54.458
What's the second thing?

1228
01:52:56.375 --> 01:52:57.750
I liked my team, Keya.

1229
01:52:58.541 --> 01:52:59.541
I miss them.

1230
01:53:01.125 --> 01:53:04.833
I wanna surround myself with people
who will change the world for good.

1231
01:53:21.541 --> 01:53:22.666
How we doing, Jack?

1232
01:53:23.333 --> 01:53:24.875
Good news and bad news.

1233
01:53:24.958 --> 01:53:28.166
The good news, I've scouted the square,
and your plan just might work.

1234
01:53:29.666 --> 01:53:30.666
The bad news--

1235
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:35.500
Uh, they were out of oat milk.

1236
01:53:35.583 --> 01:53:37.375
Jack.

1237
01:53:37.458 --> 01:53:39.250
What? You told me to blend in.

1238
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.583
Did we get into the power grid?

1239
01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:47.041
Yeah. It wasn't that hard,
because their password was "password."

1240
01:53:49.083 --> 01:53:50.083
Your coffee.

1241
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:51.750
Thank you.

1242
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:55.625
This is cold.

1243
01:53:55.708 --> 01:53:58.833
Um, you know we can still
throw you in jail, right?

1244
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Hey.

1245
01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:04.500
Stay in the van.

1246
01:54:05.875 --> 01:54:07.500
We stay in the van, boss.

1247
01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:10.833
♪ Whoa-oh ♪

1248
01:54:10.916 --> 01:54:13.083
♪ Don't stop doin'
'Cause you're scared of yourself ♪

1249
01:54:13.166 --> 01:54:17.166
♪ Look at you go, you don't need no help
And a diamond in the rough... ♪

1250
01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:19.458
- The Heart's all set.
- And the diversion?

1251
01:54:20.166 --> 01:54:21.166
Ready.

1252
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:23.458
Go give them the bam.

1253
01:54:25.083 --> 01:54:26.083
Always.
