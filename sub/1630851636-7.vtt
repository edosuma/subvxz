I'm supposed to start a cross
in ten minutes?

37:26.461 --> 37:28.811
Did they switch courtrooms on me
and not tell me?

37:28.855 --> 37:30.291
No.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.599
Well, what the hell is going on,

37:33.642 --> 37:35.122
and what are you doing here?

37:35.165 --> 37:37.385
The AUSA dropped the charges.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.517
My case is over.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.127
Dropped the...

37:40.170 --> 37:41.607
Why-why would he do that?

37:41.650 --> 37:43.826
Randall Hughes admitted he lied.

37:44.871 --> 37:47.569
He...He told us everything.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.311
Everything.

37:51.356 --> 37:56.274
[chuckles]:
Well, I don't know
why the, uh, AUSA

37:56.317 --> 37:58.319
would believe Randall Hughes

37:58.363 --> 37:59.886
if he admits he lied.

37:59.929 --> 38:01.453
Because he's not lying anymore.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.803
Obviously,
I knew that

38:03.846 --> 38:07.459
someone had bribed Hughes
to say that I bribed him,

38:07.502 --> 38:09.678
but I just couldn't
figure out who.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.332
My first candidate was
Arnold Clayton.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.334
[scoffs]:
Clayton, please.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.509
Right.

38:14.553 --> 38:15.771
It didn't make
any sense to me either,

38:15.815 --> 38:17.730
because a guy like Clayton,

38:17.773 --> 38:21.516
they write off litigation
all the time.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.823
But...
I got to thinking,

38:23.866 --> 38:27.392
Who can't afford to lose
a case like that?

38:27.435 --> 38:29.481
And then I realized...

38:30.612 --> 38:32.658
Of course. A lawyer.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.442
Someone significant.

38:34.486 --> 38:38.664
A real rainmaker
for her firm, but...

38:38.707 --> 38:40.883
she's lost one
too many cases lately.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.537
Dropped some big clients,

38:42.581 --> 38:46.324

that she's being...

38:46.367 --> 38:48.326
eased out the door.

38:48.369 --> 38:51.851
And if she lost a big case
like Smokestack, well...

38:51.894 --> 38:54.462
she'd be cooked.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.725
Nobody cares what you've done.

38:56.769 --> 38:59.859
Just what you've done lately.

38:59.902 --> 39:04.298
They were bringing charges
against Izzy, Carol.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.387
They were going to arrest her.

39:07.432 --> 39:11.653
Well, if everything
that you say about her is true,

39:11.697 --> 39:15.309
then it sounds like
what she did was not...

39:16.354 --> 39:17.746
...personal.

39:17.790 --> 39:22.360
Not at all personal.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.537
The FBI is on its way.

39:26.625 --> 39:30.629
You're not as angry
as I would expect.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.719
Oh, I'm angry.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.590
But I was there that night.

39:35.634 --> 39:38.767
I could've walked up
to that man's door.

39:38.811 --> 39:41.291
I was ready.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.816
I could be that lawyer
right now.

39:43.859 --> 39:46.688
But you're not.
You're not her.

so long to get back to you.

I promise I'm normally
much more responsive.

40:08.797 --> 40:11.626
We have been dealing
with a crisis, capital "C,"

40:11.670 --> 40:15.413
but that crisis is now
officially in the past.

40:16.849 --> 40:20.287
I would love to talk more
about what my future might hold.

BULL:
Thanks again

40:21.419 --> 40:22.811
for taking the case.[chuckles]

40:22.855 --> 40:26.511
Oh, you won't be thanking me
once you get my bill.

40:26.554 --> 40:27.947
I think it was worth
every penny.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.470
Hmm.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.298
But how many pennies
would we be talking about here?

40:31.341 --> 40:32.473
Ballpark.
Hmm.

40:32.517 --> 40:33.866
[Olivia chuckles]

40:35.563 --> 40:36.608
Do we have any champagne?

40:36.651 --> 40:37.870
Maybe some seltzer?

40:37.913 --> 40:39.959
I mean, I could get some,
but that would mean

40:40.002 --> 40:41.613
I'd have to get out of
this chair.

40:47.357 --> 40:48.315
It's your big
win, Bull.

What do you want to do?

40:50.012 --> 40:51.318
Well,

I think it's...
our big win.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.672
Couldn't have done it
without you all.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.500
Thank you.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.329
But seeing as I am the boss,

41:02.372 --> 41:05.941
I guess I should decide
how we celebrate.

take a shower and go to bed.
