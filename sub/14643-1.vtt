- What...what was that?
- It's a new app that I made.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.043
- Is that why you didn't let

00:44.110 --> 00:45.745
anyone in the basement
all summer?

00:45.812 --> 00:48.715
{\an5}- I've been inventing stuff ever
since I was a little kid.

00:48.782 --> 00:53.153
{\an8}I mean there was a Duda-copter,
a Duda-brush and a Duda-lamp.

at making things,

at naming them.

{\an8}- Sam, you need more than
an app.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.573
{\an8}You need a great first
impression.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.909
{\an8}That's what sets the tone
for the year.

for you to say.

rules you need to know.

Number one, don't eat
the meatloaf.

last year's mural.

gets a wall to decorate.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.438

threw glitter at it.

You take a lot of pics.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.252
How many followers you got?

05:53.319 --> 05:55.054
- It's not about the audience.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.324
It's about the art.

{\an8}don't mess with the seventh
graders' wall.

emotion for me.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.594
It kinda tickles.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.930
- What's wrong with your
little brother, Tyler?

07:10.997 --> 07:12.498

He...he has to throw things
or he gets dizzy.

Everything's fine. Okay.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.975
Okay, you need to run.
- Oh!

07:23.042 --> 07:25.344
This is not how I wanted
to start my first day.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.146
- Why aren't you running?

07:33.019 --> 07:35.288
- Oh, I've been in middle
school for five minutes

07:35.354 --> 07:37.190
and I've already blown it.

07:37.256 --> 07:38.724
- Oh, water under
the bridge, Sam.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.127
You're barely even gonna see
those seventh graders.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.430
- Yeah, I guess
you're right.

07:44.497 --> 07:45.665

07:55.274 --> 07:57.944
Uh, maybe your cat died?

07:58.010 --> 07:59.378
- I don't have a cat.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.681
- Maybe he wants to
give you a cat.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.616
- Oh.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.725
- Uh-uh-uh.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.460
Sam Duda.

08:14.527 --> 08:15.962
Do you know why I called
you in here?

08:16.028 --> 08:17.563
- Does it have anything
to do with cats?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.999
- Cats? Um...
No. No, it doesn't.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.535
Um, it has to do with
the seventh grade.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.370
- It was an accident.
I swear!

08:24.437 --> 08:26.739
- Now, now, now,
this is no accident.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.975
Your test scores show that
you are far too advanced

08:29.041 --> 08:30.443

08:30.509 --> 08:33.011
So we're gonna bump
you up to seventh.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.215
- But...all my friends
are in sixth.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.885
Let me take the test again.
I promise I can do worse.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.321
- [chuckling]
This is a huge honor.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.690
- This is a huge disaster.

08:48.227 --> 08:51.597
- Hey, I'll give you a dollar,
if you follow me on here.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.600
- Okay, welcome to homeroom.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.602
I'm your teacher,
Miss Tolomeo.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.105
You'll be in here for
first and last period

08:59.171 --> 09:01.641
and these are your assigned
seats, so get used to them.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.342

09:08.314 --> 09:09.749
The plan is simple.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.851
I'm gonna impersonate
Principal Platt.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.319
- And I'm gonna
impersonate the kid

09:13.386 --> 09:14.987
getting yelled at
by Principal Platt--

09:15.054 --> 09:17.490
a role I know well.

- Uh, uh, uh, ah!
