A man has a lot of choices.</i>

you're gonna have to miss.

who's gonna take over
as squad leader.

I haven't really had time
to think about it yet, sir.

Well, you better
give it some thought.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.764
You're the new squad leader.

yourself another stripe.

someone else. I...

Come again?

08:42.565 --> 08:45.084
Corporal Kettner. He's the same rank.
He's got more experience...

Corporal Kettner's
an exemplary marine.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.573

but you drew the long straw.

third deployment in four years.

going to re-up, sir.

and my wife and I,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.137

our minds yet.

the squad. That's a fact.

But, if and when you wanna
walk away from this,

09:29.320 --> 09:32.048
there's no reason you shouldn't
walk away as a sergeant.

Uh, Private, uh,
Corporal Kettner here

17:12.319 --> 17:15.423

be a terrorist in disguise

17:15.448 --> 17:17.759

on killing all of us.

17:17.784 --> 17:20.119

any plans like that?

17:22.955 --> 17:25.165

56:55.360 --> 56:56.820
Overthink it.

56:58.363 --> 56:59.572
Killing.

57:02.242 --> 57:06.371
Let me tell you somethin'. Every
day we go out, it's life or death.

57:07.163 --> 57:08.748
It's him or you.

57:09.833 --> 57:12.669
This is my first time
out as squad leader.

57:13.962 --> 57:16.272
Before yesterday, I...

57:16.297 --> 57:19.009
I never even fired
my weapon at anybody.

57:20.051 --> 57:22.762
And I never thought
I'd have to do it that close.

57:23.221 --> 57:24.889
It's all the same.

57:28.184 --> 57:30.328
They died today.

57:30.353 --> 57:31.813
And we lived.

57:33.648 --> 57:35.025
Look at me.

57:36.526 --> 57:38.153
Today was a good day.

57:41.197 --> 57:44.617
Now, I want you
to do something for me.

57:45.326 --> 57:47.912
I want you to get out
of your head and focus.

57:49.539 --> 57:51.541
Focus on the mission.

57:53.334 --> 57:55.045
The mission is God.

57:59.883 --> 58:01.051
All right.

58:05.388 --> 58:08.016
I'm gonna give you another
second and then we gotta go.

58:08.558 --> 58:10.560
Soto, start gearin' up.

58:15.356 --> 58:16.691
Let's go.

58:21.237 --> 58:23.465
You speak very good English.

58:23.490 --> 58:24.741
Thank you.

58:25.158 --> 58:27.744
Which is very unusual
for a woman in our country.

58:28.578 --> 58:30.330
May I ask where did you learn?

58:30.914 --> 58:33.249
I went to university
at Cambridge.

58:34.167 --> 58:36.019
May I ask the same of you?

58:36.044 --> 58:38.688
I was trained by the U.S.
military as a translator.

58:38.713 --> 58:40.590
In Lexington, Virginia.
KETTNER: Whoa.

58:42.967 --> 58:45.403
You learned how to speak
English in Virginia?

58:45.428 --> 58:48.306
With the help of my iPad
and Rosetta Stone.

58:49.265 --> 58:50.934
I'm not buyin' it.

58:51.267 --> 58:52.977
I'm not selling it.

58:53.686 --> 58:55.939
Brunswick stew, thick or thin?

58:56.147 --> 58:59.943
Well, if it is thin, it isn't
Brunswick stew. It is soup.

59:00.610 --> 59:01.611
Right, Corporal?

59:19.003 --> 59:20.338
What's up?

59:20.922 --> 59:22.423
Opium poppies.

59:24.509 --> 59:26.444
They're in harvest.

59:26.469 --> 59:28.655
Yeah, and where there's opium
farmers, there's Taliban.

59:28.680 --> 59:29.989
You got it.

59:30.014 --> 59:31.015
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

59:33.476 --> 59:35.703
Move, Marines! Move! Move!

59:35.728 --> 59:38.982
Marines, 100 meters, follow me!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

59:41.317 --> 59:43.278
Get down! Get down in it!

59:44.779 --> 59:46.281
(SHOUTING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)

59:46.739 --> 59:48.992

01:00:09.679 --> 01:00:10.680
Ah!

01:00:19.606 --> 01:00:21.191
Watch your six!

01:00:37.081 --> 01:00:38.333
Shit.

01:00:42.212 --> 01:00:43.213
Ah!

01:00:51.054 --> 01:00:52.055
Ah!

01:01:13.576 --> 01:01:14.702
(COUGHS)

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.167
Hey. Hey, hey. I got you. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.862
Get me a poppy. A poppy.

01:01:32.887 --> 01:01:34.572
Kettner, go grab a poppy.

01:01:34.597 --> 01:01:35.907
Listen.

01:01:35.932 --> 01:01:40.828
You gotta get to the village and
talk to the police captain.

01:01:40.853 --> 01:01:42.914
You hear me?
I will. Yes.

01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:44.107
Okay.

01:01:45.275 --> 01:01:46.693
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:01:51.281 --> 01:01:52.323
Okay.

01:01:53.574 --> 01:01:57.845
Now listen to me,
you gotta get her out.

01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:59.430
You have 24 hours.

01:01:59.455 --> 01:02:01.207
Chief, we're truck drivers.

01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:03.459
You're a marine!

01:02:04.585 --> 01:02:06.271
And this country needs her.

01:02:06.296 --> 01:02:08.423
You wanna risk the lives of
my men for some symbol?

01:02:09.632 --> 01:02:11.426
What do you think this is?

01:02:14.679 --> 01:02:16.472
FOX: Bring me Anoosh.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.945
These men are gonna get you out.

01:02:34.574 --> 01:02:35.783
What is your name?

01:02:37.994 --> 01:02:39.370
It's John.

01:02:40.496 --> 01:02:41.706
Thank you, John.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.005
Okay.

01:02:49.547 --> 01:02:51.007
Give me your hands.

01:02:58.514 --> 01:02:59.682
Merrimette,

01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:02.018
no easy day, huh?

01:03:48.064 --> 01:03:50.525
What are we gonna do now, man?
We gotta get outta here.

01:03:55.738 --> 01:03:57.865
You're in charge, Corporal.
Your orders.

01:03:59.409 --> 01:04:00.535
Call it.

01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:02.578
Just...

01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:04.622
Just gimme a minute.

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.421
Come here.

01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:13.089
MERRIMETTE: Come with me.

01:04:17.427 --> 01:04:18.678
Who the hell are you?

01:04:20.555 --> 01:04:22.265
I'm not unlike you.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.353
I am fighting for the
rights for my people,

01:04:28.646 --> 01:04:30.940
and your government
is supportive of my cause.

01:04:31.524 --> 01:04:34.777
A lot of good men have died for
you, so I hope you're worth it.

01:04:35.111 --> 01:04:36.529
So do I.

01:04:41.909 --> 01:04:43.453
We need to get to that village.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.221
I think we should
talk about this.

01:04:45.246 --> 01:04:47.515
Nothin' to talk about. It's
my squad, makes it my call.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.834
I don't mean to question you.
Then don't.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.087
All due respect,
Corporal, this...

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.339
ALLEN: She's not our mission.

01:04:57.341 --> 01:04:58.509
She is now.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.189
Get ready to move out.

01:05:13.733 --> 01:05:15.418

01:05:18.488 --> 01:05:19.489
Let's go.

01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:32.311
MERRIMETTE: Door on the left.

01:06:37.191 --> 01:06:38.192
FAISAL: Clear.

01:06:51.914 --> 01:06:53.457
Windows and door on the right.

01:06:55.626 --> 01:06:56.627
Clear.

01:07:04.176 --> 01:07:05.469
Stay sharp, Marines.

01:07:21.152 --> 01:07:22.445
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

01:07:24.113 --> 01:07:25.114
Jeez, kid.

01:07:26.449 --> 01:07:28.009
Beat it, kid. I'm not in the mood.
All right.

01:07:28.034 --> 01:07:29.927
Get the fuck outta here.

01:07:29.952 --> 01:07:32.221
Hey, I got somebody with a
video camera at the window.

01:07:32.246 --> 01:07:33.331
Is he armed?

01:07:33.539 --> 01:07:34.599
I can't tell.

01:07:34.624 --> 01:07:35.791
Keep an eye on him.

01:07:37.209 --> 01:07:38.502
Hey, put the camera down.

01:07:39.337 --> 01:07:41.005
Put the video camera down.

01:07:41.464 --> 01:07:44.008
Put the camera down.

01:07:45.217 --> 01:07:46.360
KETTNER: Movement.

01:07:46.385 --> 01:07:48.237
Hey, hey!
KETTNER: Gun!

01:07:48.262 --> 01:07:49.989
Drop the weapon!

01:07:50.014 --> 01:07:52.033

his fucking weapon.

01:08:09.325 --> 01:08:10.326
What's he saying?

01:08:11.077 --> 01:08:12.953
He's invited us to
come inside and talk.

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:20.086
All right, let's get
her inside now.

01:08:37.185 --> 01:08:40.022
What's goin' on?
He is offering us chai.

01:08:40.564 --> 01:08:41.732
Thank you.

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:45.044
Tell him Senior Chief Fox
sent us.

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:47.837
We need to make arrangements with
our base so they can come get us.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:01.085

01:09:01.711 --> 01:09:04.563
It looks like everyone's
clearing out, Corporal.

01:09:04.587 --> 01:09:06.064
It looks good.

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.341
Still got that video camera
in that window though.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.053
Hey, A-Slash.
Yeah?

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.723
Stay sharp, buddy.
Roger that.

About to be on the
evening news, sir.

01:09:18.144 --> 01:09:19.703
Well, just stay
on him, all right?

01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:21.080
Let me know if anything changes.

01:09:21.104 --> 01:09:22.747
Hey, Corporal?
What's up?

01:09:22.773 --> 01:09:24.859
Can I get one of those chais?

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:26.944
I'll see what I can do.

Yeah?

01:09:29.572 --> 01:09:31.991
Ever have a camel milk
chai latte?

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:37.787
He says he is sorry to hear about Fox and
that he was a true friend to the village.

01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:41.041

contact our base. How soon?

No.

01:10:00.936 --> 01:10:02.188
Yeah.

FAISAL: Then why does
she travel with us?

01:10:14.408 --> 01:10:17.219
That question's
above my pay grade.

01:10:17.244 --> 01:10:19.580
I just need to get her out
of here and back to base.

01:10:19.914 --> 01:10:21.974
He is saying she is safe here.

01:10:21.999 --> 01:10:24.084
Tell him I have my orders.

01:10:27.922 --> 01:10:31.050
FAISAL: He has his also. What the
hell's that supposed to mean?

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:38.282
FAISAL: Because she is Afghani
national and not our prisoner,

01:10:38.307 --> 01:10:40.451
he must seek permission
from the provincial commander

01:10:40.476 --> 01:10:43.329
before he can allow us
to leave with her.

01:10:43.354 --> 01:10:46.482
All right. Let him know that
we're running out of time.

01:10:46.649 --> 01:10:49.668
Time. We need to
get this done now.

01:10:49.693 --> 01:10:53.547
I don't understand. We got
goddamned satellites up there

01:10:53.572 --> 01:10:55.466
that can see everything,
they can see up your asshole.

01:10:55.491 --> 01:10:57.051
You know that, don't you?
JONES: Yes, sir.

01:10:57.076 --> 01:10:58.327
See into your bedroom.

01:10:58.536 --> 01:11:00.429
All this goddamned technology,

01:11:00.454 --> 01:11:03.624
all this manpower,
we cannot locate five marines?

01:11:04.083 --> 01:11:06.310
Perfect storm of bad
stuff happening, sir.

01:11:06.335 --> 01:11:10.731
They got ambushed, marine comms go
down, sandstorm between them and us.

01:11:10.756 --> 01:11:12.733
Well, what about
the air on station?

01:11:12.758 --> 01:11:14.235
Do we have any direct support?

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.511
Still grounded, sir.

01:11:15.761 --> 01:11:17.279
Son of a bitch!

01:11:17.304 --> 01:11:20.157
I got a Humvee column rollin'
outta FOB Keenan now, sir.

01:11:20.182 --> 01:11:22.910
Keenan?
That's Royal Irish Regiment?

We goddamned better hope for a
little luck of the Irish here.

01:11:26.564 --> 01:11:29.044
They're on the other side of the
sandstorm and they got access.

01:11:29.066 --> 01:11:32.086
Now you're telling me that this
is our best worst option, right?

01:11:32.111 --> 01:11:33.838
I'm afraid so.

01:11:33.863 --> 01:11:37.258
I do have some actual intel on who's the
package that they're traveling with.

01:11:37.283 --> 01:11:38.509
Talk to me.

01:11:38.534 --> 01:11:40.177
Her name is Anoosh Hassan.

01:11:40.202 --> 01:11:42.888
Anoosh Hassan?
I know the name. Who is she?

01:11:42.913 --> 01:11:44.056
It's a women's rights' activist.

01:11:44.081 --> 01:11:45.474
She's a real hero to the
people in the provinces.

01:11:45.499 --> 01:11:46.642
She's a beacon of hope.

01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:48.310
The Taliban wants her dead, sir.

01:11:48.335 --> 01:11:49.895
And Washington wants her alive.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.647
Yup. She's good PR.

01:11:51.672 --> 01:11:55.676
She's good PR. You know
what's bad PR in my book?

01:11:55.885 --> 01:11:58.470
Dead marines are bad PR.

01:11:58.762 --> 01:12:00.573
She's a keynote speaker

She's scheduled to be
in New York in 36 hours.

01:12:04.977 --> 01:12:07.788
That's direct from Washington. She's
the president's guest of honor.

01:12:07.813 --> 01:12:11.317

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.667
<i>He fights for the man
who can't stand anymore.</i>

01:36:07.293 --> 01:36:11.355
<i>He fights so that others can have the
opportunity to make a difference.</i>

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:14.592
<i>That's how we make
the unforgiving forgivable.</i>

01:36:15.092 --> 01:36:20.681
<i>And if we're lucky, somewhere in all the
fighting and dying, we discover hope.</i>

01:36:21.182 --> 01:36:24.060
<i>And the marines who killed
and bled and died</i>

01:36:24.518 --> 01:36:26.354
<i>will always be jarheads.</i>

01:36:27.772 --> 01:36:29.749
<i>Their families will have to live
with the unbearable demands</i>

01:36:29.774 --> 01:36:31.567
<i>of their ultimate sacrifice.</i>

01:36:49.752 --> 01:36:52.313
MARINE 1: Unidentified
vehicle, 12 o'clock!

01:36:52.338 --> 01:36:53.547
MARINE 2: Get out
of the truck!

01:36:54.256 --> 01:36:56.050
Show me your hands!

01:36:56.759 --> 01:36:58.552
U.S. Marines.

01:36:59.178 --> 01:37:00.196
Marine.

01:37:00.221 --> 01:37:02.848
Hey, it's me, Merrimette.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.778
Unload.

01:37:20.908 --> 01:37:22.243
Come on.

01:38:01.824 --> 01:38:03.742
Welcome home, Marines.

01:38:04.285 --> 01:38:06.120
It's good to have you back.

01:38:06.370 --> 01:38:08.122
Thank you, sir.

01:38:11.792 --> 01:38:13.419
Thank you, sir.

01:38:46.202 --> 01:38:48.804
MERRIMETTE: <i>And the ones who make it home,</i>

01:38:48.829 --> 01:38:51.707
<i>we never really leave
our brothers behind.</i>

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:54.752
<i>We always remember.</i>

01:38:55.503 --> 01:38:58.005
<i>We're professional fighting men.</i>

01:38:58.464 --> 01:39:00.257
<i>We are jarheads.</i>
