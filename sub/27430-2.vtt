00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.008 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.349
-Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.279
My mission

00:29.362 --> 00:32.741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Ching!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
The KonMari Method is unique because

00:45.336 --> 00:48.256
<i>I organize by category</i>
<i>rather than by location.</i>

00:48.339 --> 00:51.718
In the KonMari Method, we tidy
five categories in a specific order.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, is clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute.
I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.080
<i>Mushu, where are you?</i>
<i>Kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:04.791
I do not see Mushu.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.460
Oh, no. That window was open.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.005
Okay.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.591
Mushu, here, boy, Here kitty, kitty, kitty

02:14.050 --> 02:14.926
Mushu?

02:15.677 --> 02:17.470
Moosh, okay, boy, come here.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.180
-Hello, sweetie. Come here.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.141
Atta-- Come on.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.392
Up we go, up we go.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.309
Alright, gotcha.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.271
Come on.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.897
My name is Wendy Akiyama.
And I'm Ron Akiyama.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.278
<i>We inherited the house in 1994.</i>

02:34.237 --> 02:35.780
<i>Raised our children here.</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:38.741
<i>But we are now empty-nesters.</i>

02:39.242 --> 02:41.703
<i>But now the clutter,</i>
<i>it prevents me from having</i>

02:41.786 --> 02:44.330
<i>what I would call a normal retirement.</i>

02:44.414 --> 02:47.041
<i>So I want Marie Kondo's help</i>

02:47.792 --> 02:51.838
to actually maximize
our enjoyment in this house.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.673
Ditto everything she just said.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.801
'Cause I'm her husband.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.723
<i>Ron's family moved here in 1968.</i>

03:01.848 --> 03:05.894
<i>My parents bought the house</i>
<i>on the street down below</i>

03:05.977 --> 03:07.645
<i>at the same time that they were here.</i>

03:07.770 --> 03:09.355
<i>Ended up marrying the boy next door.</i>

03:09.439 --> 03:10.773
- <i>Literally.</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

03:11.024 --> 03:12.483
We've been married for...

03:13.151 --> 03:15.195
What did I--? Forty-two years.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.279
Forty-two?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.072
Seventy-six. Yeah, 42 years.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.950
So, you know, we've gotten
to the point where,

03:21.034 --> 03:24.204
you know, even if I come home and sit here
and we don't say one word to each other,

03:24.287 --> 03:26.164
he's just watching TV and I fall asleep...

03:26.623 --> 03:27.832
it's a great relationship.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.876
We don't feel pressured to,
"Oh, how was your day?"

03:29.959 --> 03:30.877
"Oh, how was your day?"

03:30.960 --> 03:33.046
You know, it's-- there's just no pressure.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.840
I feel like talking, I'll talk.
I don't wanna talk, I'm not gonna talk.
<i>You know? And there's no,</i>
<i>"Well, why aren't you talking to me?"</i>

03:38.718 --> 03:43.056
<i>You know, so this is a great time</i>
<i>for us to tackle something new like this</i>

03:43.139 --> 03:45.683
<i>where we're both going to be</i>
<i>involved together.</i>

03:46.809 --> 03:47.727
What do you think?

03:48.978 --> 03:49.812
It is.

03:49.896 --> 03:50.813
Okay.

03:50.897 --> 03:55.360
I have worked with many couples

03:55.443 --> 03:59.322
who wanted to re-evaluate their life
after their children have left home.

03:59.864 --> 04:03.284
I have every confidence that if
Ron and Wendy progress step by step,

04:03.534 --> 04:06.246
they will be able to discover

04:06.329 --> 04:10.541
what's truly important in their life.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.885
Which one?

04:20.969 --> 04:21.803
Which one is it?

04:21.886 --> 04:23.054
Oh, it's this one.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.686
Today are people of Japanese descent.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.521
Oh, really?!

04:31.604 --> 04:33.106
The outside looks a little Japanese.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.984
That's very Japanese.

04:36.067 --> 04:39.279
But there's no name plate.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.493
- Hi!
- Hey!

04:45.576 --> 04:47.495
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.873
-I'm Marie.
-Yes! Oh, yes, I know.

04:50.957 --> 04:55.211
-I am Wendy and this is my son, Russell.
-Hi, Marie, nice to meet you.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.963
-What was your name?
-Iida.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.424
- It's Marie Kondo?
-Marie Kondo.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.884
Kondo. Perfect. We're Akiyamas.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.178
Yeah, we know--

05:04.637 --> 05:06.264
Little bit. Yeah.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.100
-I know a little bit English.
-All I'm saying is this job is gonna be,

05:09.434 --> 05:11.311
-what is it, <i>taihen?</i>
<i>-</i> It's okay.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.479
Yeah, my husband is here somewhere.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.565
-He'll be here in a minute.
-He might be in the back.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.860
-I think he's in the backyard.
-He might be in the backyard, yes.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.903
Oh. Speak of the devil!

05:20.987 --> 05:23.281
-Oh, gosh, there you are.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.490
-Perfect.
-This is Ron.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.492
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Marie.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.786
Yes, I recognize your face from...

05:29.245 --> 05:30.330
from YouTube.

05:33.624 --> 05:38.296
So I would love to get a little bit of
a tour inside your home, if that's okay?

05:38.379 --> 05:39.881
My name is Russell, um,

05:39.964 --> 05:43.968
<i>and part of the reason why I am here</i>
<i>is to help my mom,</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:49.265
<i>because I think that there is a little bit</i>
<i>of hesitation and concern for my dad</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:53.394
about the daunting mountain of things
my parents are gonna have to go through.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.354
But, you know,

05:54.979 --> 05:56.814
<i>even though he's a man of few words,</i>

05:56.898 --> 06:00.651
<i>you know, being able to have</i>
<i>an activity like this with my mom,</i>

06:00.735 --> 06:04.364
he and my mom can get to know
each other in this new process.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.492
Cleaning the house was definitely--
wasn't my priority,

06:07.950 --> 06:09.243
but it would definitely be hers.

06:09.327 --> 06:14.874
<i>I'm of the subscription</i>
<i>to happy wife, happy life, so I...</i>

06:15.291 --> 06:18.878
I support whatever it takes
to have a clean house,

06:18.961 --> 06:20.880
if that makes Mama happy.

06:20.963 --> 06:24.842
So I'm just not 100% in it
because I don't know what it entails yet,

06:24.926 --> 06:27.970
so... let's see what happens here.

06:32.809 --> 06:36.562
-Okay, so master bedroom, Marie.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.441
And then this is what
we're dealing with here.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.068
Baseball cards, Marie.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.653
Baseball card!

06:43.736 --> 06:45.822
Those boxes all used to be white.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.616
So all of these belong
to your husband?

06:48.699 --> 06:52.036
Yes, the kids worked
with my husband, collected cards,

06:52.537 --> 06:53.955
so this is the end result.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.334
<i>Ron is really perfectly willing to</i>

06:59.127 --> 07:00.461
<i>have things be status quo.</i>

07:00.586 --> 07:03.172
And maintaining the status quo

07:03.256 --> 07:06.801
actually does inhibit you
from being creative

07:06.884 --> 07:09.720
and having, um, different approaches

07:09.804 --> 07:12.056
to solving the problems in your life.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.935
If you're satisfied with the status quo
then nothing's gonna change

07:16.018 --> 07:17.395
because you don't want change.

07:17.812 --> 07:23.109
<i>So I hope it's never too late</i>
<i>to teach old dogs new tricks.</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:29.198
This is not everything, Marie.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.493
There's...
There's much more.

07:32.743 --> 07:33.703
More clothes?

07:33.786 --> 07:34.912
Yes. Yes.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.581
-Oh, you wanna see that next?
-Yeah.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.711
So this used to be
a bedroom with a bed in it.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.546
I see a lot of clothes
with tags still on.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.840
There's lots of things with tags, yes.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.177
And one of the things I would like to see
for her retirement,

07:49.260 --> 07:53.222
if we can transform this room
into her office.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.102
And I'd love to see the one
last place we have clothes.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.397
Yeah, there's actually two more rooms
to look at in here.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.399
Okay, this is Russell's old room.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.276
Ah.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.944
Those are all mine.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.238
This is my little brother's room.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.869
And there's more in the closet.
The disorganization is stressful.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.330
<i>I try to just bury it, not think about it,</i>

08:17.413 --> 08:19.957
<i>to live with floor-to-ceiling boxes,</i>

08:20.041 --> 08:24.420
<i>and to have a whole room of clothing</i>
<i>that is just kinda thrown over things.</i>

08:24.504 --> 08:26.797
We can't find stuff
and that does bother me.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.301
And I think that getting
that organized will help,

08:30.384 --> 08:35.806
you know, to make this feel like the home
that I really would like to have.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.145
So this way is the rumpus room, please.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.482
Amazing, is this an activity room?

08:44.565 --> 08:46.317
I'd say an activity room.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.903
A room where you watch TV,
you play games,

08:48.986 --> 08:51.072
and this is the Christmas collection

08:51.155 --> 08:55.117
which I've been trying
to figure out how to put away.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.748
So, just wondering,
Christmas materials,

09:00.831 --> 09:03.084
in the living room and all of this,
that's it, right?

09:03.167 --> 09:04.961
No, and the kitchen. And the bathroom.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.588
And there's some nutcrackers
that are still out, yeah.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.967
My love of Christmas started
when I was a little girl.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.344
<i>My mom, she was the one who</i>

09:13.427 --> 09:16.764
<i>actually made it really special for us</i>
<i>as we were growing up</i>

09:16.847 --> 09:18.891
<i>and I wanted to do the same</i>
<i>for my children.</i>

09:18.975 --> 09:20.434
<i>Decorations were really important.</i>

09:20.518 --> 09:24.355
<i>To me that was a big deal,</i>
<i>because now you know Christmas is coming.</i>

09:24.564 --> 09:29.569
<i>And having the house, you know, decorated</i>
<i>for Christmas just makes me happy.</i>

09:30.027 --> 09:30.945
It's nice.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.659
You have a lot of memorabilia,
keepsakes in here.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.494
-Yes.
-Yes, yes.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.288
-Oh, okay.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.500
We're gonna go look
at the garage next. Yeah.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.045
-After you. Go ahead.
-Oh!

09:48.254 --> 09:51.007
-At least there's room for you to walk.
- Garage.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.593
- There is room. Oh, there you are.

09:55.303 --> 09:59.223
- I didn't expect him up there.
-Yeah, that's Mushu and Mulan.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.352
This is where a lot
of everything ended up.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.270
Yes.

10:04.353 --> 10:10.735
We have no idea on how many boxes
are in the garage and what's in them.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.155
<i>For most of its life,</i>
<i>the garage has been...</i>

10:14.864 --> 10:15.865
<i>a clutter.</i>

10:16.240 --> 10:18.326
<i>And we have...</i>

10:18.784 --> 10:22.913
three generations
of belongings in this house.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.750
It began with Ron's mom and dad.

10:25.833 --> 10:29.629
<i>They brought their belongings</i>
<i>from their previous home.</i>

10:29.712 --> 10:33.799
And now we have our children's items
which are still in this house

10:33.883 --> 10:36.427
and Ron's items and my items.

10:40.431 --> 10:44.310
I do think that it will take a significant
amount of time going through all this.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.355
- But you will finish.
-Yes!

10:47.438 --> 10:49.315
-Okay.
-That's what I want to hear!

10:49.398 --> 10:51.484
-Can I get a high five, Marie?
- Yes!

10:51.567 --> 10:52.777
-Here we go!

10:53.277 --> 10:54.111
We're on.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.410
So, just as I introduced
myself to you today,

11:01.494 --> 11:03.871
I always also introduce
myself to the house.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.957
I love that. I love that.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.836
-I never thought of talking to our house.
- We should.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.547
-We should talk more to our house!
-Yes.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.174
Yes, this is a good spot to do that.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.844
And asking our house to cooperate with us?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.721
-That's great.
-I love that.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.474
Should we do-- Can we do that?

11:23.557 --> 11:25.226
Can we kneel on the floor?

11:25.309 --> 11:28.521
Can you do <i>seiza?</i> Like this?
The Japanese proper way of sitting.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.315
-I don't think so.
- If you can't, that's okay.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.060
- Were you able to greet it?

12:08.144 --> 12:09.520
-Yes, I was.
- Okay.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.359
When tidying your clothes,

12:15.443 --> 12:21.157
you will take everything out
and create one big pile.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.784
This may seem like a hassle,

12:24.076 --> 12:26.579
but please do not skip this step.

12:27.121 --> 12:31.876
Only by creating one big pile

12:31.959 --> 12:36.964
are you able to see how much clothing
you actually have.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.759
You will also be shocked at the amount
of clothing you have.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.261
By experiencing this shock,

12:42.344 --> 12:47.600
you will finally be able to decide
what items are truly necessary for you.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.399
- I'll do this bit.
-You really do own a load of jackets.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.067
Yeah, I do. That's my weak point.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.239
It just makes me feel good
that I have 'em.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.117
I think it'll make you feel good
to get the space back, too.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.373
-Oh, sorry!
-Excuse me.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.167
Here you go, now drawers.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.002
There's truly a lot here.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.509
So, how long did it take, about an hour?

13:23.677 --> 13:24.720
Just about.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.310
I'm going to be honest with you.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.482
This is the biggest pile
I've seen of all my clients.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.317
Yay! I win!

13:38.943 --> 13:40.694
-I don't know if that's how this works.
-Yay!

13:42.238 --> 13:45.533
<i>For me, clothes are a passion,</i>

13:45.616 --> 13:48.494
<i>an obsession, recreation.</i>

13:48.661 --> 13:53.165
<i>Retail therapy is definitely something</i>
<i>I'm guilty of using.</i>

13:53.249 --> 13:55.501
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>whenever Ron and I would fight,</i>

13:55.584 --> 13:58.003
<i>shopping was a diversion,</i>
<i>it was a way to, you know,</i>

13:58.087 --> 14:00.548
just calm down, de-stress.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.841
Um...

14:01.924 --> 14:05.803
Maybe, you know, hit Ron where it hurts,
in his pocketbook.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.638
I know!

14:09.390 --> 14:11.308
Holy cow, Ron!

14:12.017 --> 14:14.520
-This is pretty bad.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.774
-He's working really hard.
-Holy moly.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.692
He is.

14:20.067 --> 14:24.446
And just to-- to clarify
or to keep fresh in my mind,
the object isn't necessarily
to throw everything away,

14:29.201 --> 14:31.662
it's to be-- it's like almost like--
Correct me if I'm wrong,
like reacquaint yourself...

14:34.290 --> 14:36.542
-...with your belongings.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.796
What I really want you to ask yourself

14:40.880 --> 14:45.885
is if it's something
you really want to take into your future.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.803
-Yes.
-Yeah.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.849
So, your homework for this week

14:51.932 --> 14:54.727
is to finish sorting
through all of your clothes.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.936
Okay, great.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.980
Thank you very much!

14:58.522 --> 14:59.356
Thank you.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.115
I'm kind of an old school,
macho kinda guy

15:08.198 --> 15:10.367
and this isn't
something that I normally would do.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.662
But, um, Wendy's kind of overwhelmed.

15:13.746 --> 15:18.083
<i>It's kind of unfair that her pile is</i>
<i>three or four times what my pile is.</i>

15:18.167 --> 15:19.752
<i>But my thing is baseball cards,</i>

15:19.835 --> 15:23.464
so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get
the crack of the whip for that.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.968
I love having all of this. I would not
just take the whole mountain
and just chuck it out.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.640
I really love what I have.
I love clothing.

15:34.058 --> 15:37.269
<i>But to put it,</i>
<i>everything all in one pile,</i>

15:37.353 --> 15:38.646
<i>I've never done that before,</i>

15:38.729 --> 15:43.943
and I've never seen the accumulation
of everything that I own that's clothing.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.236
<i>So now I am overwhelmed.</i>

15:46.820 --> 15:50.366
I'm gonna probably keep this one
'cause, again, I like the colors...

15:51.325 --> 15:55.746
and it's really soft
and comfortable, so yes.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.206
We will keep that one.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.959
I'm starting from the bottom,

16:00.167 --> 16:02.211
just throwing everything down.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.006
I like it, I love florals, so...

16:06.590 --> 16:08.884
we will probably
be keeping that one.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.679
This is really heavy under--

16:11.762 --> 16:13.347
Okay, I can't pull it out.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.809
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>I would make paper dolls</i>

16:16.892 --> 16:18.727
and just design clothing for them,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.105
piles and piles of clothing
and keep changing them.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.440
<i>And so as I grew older,</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.150
I became the paper doll.

16:25.234 --> 16:29.113
<i>I still like to look at clothes,</i>
<i>I still like to try them on,</i>

16:29.196 --> 16:32.658
<i>and, um, this is really hard for me to do.</i>

16:32.741 --> 16:34.618
Okay, I like that one, too.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.996
The anxiety part is...

16:37.746 --> 16:41.583
trying to understand what I have
so that I can use it.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.127
Seen the top of the bed, yet?

16:43.627 --> 16:44.878
Um, no.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.338
I'm keeping a lot.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.549
Well, yeah. I figured.

16:48.632 --> 16:51.343
I have to make it go down.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.222
I hope the next time
I see Marie that this is gone.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.768
<i>Are we just throwing this in a bag?</i>

16:59.852 --> 17:01.145
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

17:01.228 --> 17:03.105
Let's just get the process done.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.150
You can walk when you get to Heaven,
so let's hurry up.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.537
-Hi!
-Hello, Marie.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.957
Good to see you. Iida, good to see you.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.209
- Hello again.
-How are you guys?

17:24.293 --> 17:26.670
-Good!
-It's hot, hot, hot.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.589
It got really hot quite suddenly.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.840
I've been taking out...

17:30.257 --> 17:32.301
Lots of <i>gomi.</i>

17:32.384 --> 17:34.678
<i>Things that we let go that are--</i>
<i>should be trash,</i>

17:35.179 --> 17:37.514
<i>and things that we're letting go</i>

17:37.598 --> 17:40.934
that are gonna be donated are all
still piling up down here.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.646
I had no idea there was an extra
room in there.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.566
There's a bathroom there,
believe it or not.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.401
See, look at it. There's a lot!

17:49.485 --> 17:51.695
- There's a lot.
- It's a large pile. Again.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.324
But this time these are things
that are going, right?

17:55.407 --> 17:59.036
You want to see upstairs and I'll show you
how we completed our homework.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.746
Yes, please show me.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.581
<i>So we'll start here.</i>

18:02.831 --> 18:05.709
-<i>This is where we had everything piled.</i>
- <i>Wow!</i>

18:05.793 --> 18:07.669
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

18:07.753 --> 18:10.422
-You worked so hard!

18:10.589 --> 18:12.466
I did it. I did it. I got rid of a lot.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.219
You know, it was easy on that one.
Yeah, lotta bags have gone.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.971
So in here, sweaters was really huge, too.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.017
Now that you've
tackled your clothes,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.103
what kind of effect has it had
on the way you shop?

18:24.186 --> 18:26.939
When I go through my emails that come
from all my favorite stores

18:27.022 --> 18:30.776
and I'm going, delete, delete, de--
I'm not even opening the emails.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.528
Even when it's a sale.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.445
Big difference.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.030
Yes. Yes, yes.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.951
So, you've worked so hard
on the tidying clothes,

18:39.034 --> 18:40.577
-I would love to move on.
-Okay.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.378
Christmas decorations.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.505
How do you feel looking at all of this?

18:51.588 --> 18:54.341
Well, right now I don't feel really good
looking at all of them,

18:54.424 --> 18:58.720
but once they're organized
into their own little cases,

18:58.804 --> 19:01.598
it just makes me feel
really good that I have them.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.061
What do you think of the quantity, though?

19:06.145 --> 19:09.356
-Does this feel right for you?
-Yes, because we have a big house

19:09.523 --> 19:13.360
and I like to have Christmas, like,
in the three main entertaining rooms.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.904
So I feel I need this many

19:15.988 --> 19:19.366
in order to bring Christmas
to all three of the main rooms.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.539
I don't recommended putting things
in plastic bags like this.

19:25.706 --> 19:29.001
It starts to look like <i>gomi,</i> or trash.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.466
Satsuki, these are Christmas decorations.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.511
- And this one?
- This one, too? Here you go.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.681
My little girls love Christmas as well.

19:42.806 --> 19:47.895
But I don't think they share
the same enthusiasm as Wendy.

19:48.395 --> 19:51.148
Here are some tips
for tidying Christmas decorations.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.692
Create one big pile.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.277
Hold each item one by one.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.197
Only keep the ones that spark joy.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.910
I'm sure there are a lot of families
who use Christmas to decorate together.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.496
In those situations, it would be great
if everyone did it together.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.748
Hey, Satsuki.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.209
Does this spark joy?

20:10.459 --> 20:12.211
-Yeah.
-Yes.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.004
It sparks joy.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.174
Here are some tips
on storing seasonal decorations.

20:17.257 --> 20:21.178
First, do not store them in trash bags.

20:21.345 --> 20:25.265
Put the decorations in a box.

20:25.515 --> 20:29.102
For example, store them
in clear containers like this.

20:29.186 --> 20:33.148
That way, it'll be easier
to see what's inside.

20:35.484 --> 20:39.404
So this morning, Ron and I got up
at five o'clock in the morning

20:39.488 --> 20:43.325
and we piled it on top of all the sofas

20:43.408 --> 20:45.327
so that we have
more room here to work.

20:45.410 --> 20:49.831
Wendy is starting
to take apart Christmas.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.291
And...

20:51.917 --> 20:55.212
the infamous nutcrackers
are where she is--

20:55.295 --> 20:56.129
Goodbye!

20:56.213 --> 20:58.131
Not necessarily where
she's starting, but--

20:58.215 --> 21:01.551
I don't know if you remember,
but that was super full.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.887
She's got these clear...

21:04.763 --> 21:08.558
bins that I think
she was talking to Marie about.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.771
Here's two bins
that she's already done.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.191
<i>I really-- I love Christmas</i>
<i>and I do realize</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:20.696
it was-- it was a little overboard here,
you know, with things just in every--

21:20.779 --> 21:23.073
It almost looked like I was
selling the stuff.

21:23.240 --> 21:29.413
So I learned that it didn't have to be
that extreme to look really festive.

21:29.496 --> 21:33.792
So, um, I'm gonna change the way
I decorate this year.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.880
<i>Wendy started off with Mount Wendy</i>

21:38.964 --> 21:42.342
<i>because the clothes was probably</i>
<i>the most daunting thing that she had.</i>

21:42.426 --> 21:46.471
<i>And so the cards was gonna--</i>
<i>are gonna be my Mount Ron.</i>

21:47.848 --> 21:50.267
Found Marino's rookie card.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.937
And John Elway's rookie card.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.065
<i>Baseball cards is something that</i>

21:57.399 --> 21:59.818
<i>me and the kids have been</i>
<i>collecting for over 30 year--</i>

21:59.901 --> 22:01.862
<i>I've been collecting</i>
<i>for longer than that,</i>

22:01.945 --> 22:03.655
<i>but with the kids, over 30 years.</i>

22:04.197 --> 22:08.285
<i>Going through this process, it has made</i>
<i>me think about things more,</i>

22:08.368 --> 22:11.913
<i>about whether, does it make sense</i>
<i>for me to keep it,</i>

22:12.331 --> 22:13.999
or does it make sense
for me to treasure it,

22:14.082 --> 22:17.210
or does it make sense for me
to say thanks and get rid of it?

22:17.294 --> 22:20.881
I never really thought that I would think
the way I'm thinking about baseball cards

22:21.173 --> 22:22.799
now the way I am.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.551
If I really think about it,

22:25.218 --> 22:27.179
I only need to keep ten percent of it.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.808
Oh, let's see. How is he doing?

22:32.893 --> 22:33.810
Aww.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.606
He actually conked out.

22:38.273 --> 22:42.361
I'm looking, I mean look at
all this carnage here.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.280
Believe it or not,
he has it under control.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.657
It doesn't look like it, but he does.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.706
So we're gonna do
the fall stuff over here, right?

22:55.040 --> 22:55.874
Yes.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.340
Clumsy, Wen.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.801
I know, well, it wasn't
anything important.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.971
There are a lot of things out here.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.349
There's some more.

23:13.975 --> 23:14.893
Hi!

23:14.976 --> 23:15.936
How are you?

23:16.019 --> 23:18.271
I'm so dirty!

23:18.355 --> 23:19.940
How are you, Iida?

23:20.023 --> 23:22.442
-Come in. Come in.
-Hi, good to see you.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.778
Good seeing you. Yeah, I know I'm not--

23:25.320 --> 23:26.947
So, you wanna see the garage?

23:27.030 --> 23:29.825
- Absolutely!
- Of course. I can't wait.

23:32.285 --> 23:35.455
-You can see the other side!
-I know! Isn't it amazing?

23:35.997 --> 23:38.333
-<i>Konnichiwa. </i>Hello Ron!
- Hey. <i>Konnichiwa.</i>

23:41.294 --> 23:44.089
So, did you guys discover
anything new about each other

23:44.172 --> 23:46.341
while you were tidying this garage?

23:46.425 --> 23:47.968
Well, what'd you call me, Ron?

23:48.051 --> 23:49.636
- <i>Gasa gasa.</i>
-I'm <i>gasa gasa.</i>

23:49.886 --> 23:51.138
<i>-Gasa gasa!</i>

23:51.221 --> 23:53.306
He slows me down.
I kinda make him hurry up.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.643
Ron's reaction to the thought
of going into this project

23:56.726 --> 23:58.437
was, like, I guess what most men would--

23:58.520 --> 24:01.440
like, "What's wrong with the way
things are right now?" You know?

24:01.565 --> 24:04.192
"If it isn't broke, don't fix it."

24:04.484 --> 24:06.945
But now, he's enjoying it.
I think he's enjoying the results.

24:07.028 --> 24:10.782
His creativity level just jumped,
you know, it just went onto the moon.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.993
He's like, "Why don't we do this,
why don't we do that?"

24:13.076 --> 24:15.787
<i>We're working together</i>
<i>to accomplish something</i>

24:15.871 --> 24:18.498
<i>that we think is definitely</i>
<i>gonna be life-changing.</i>

24:18.582 --> 24:21.585
I think since Marie's come here,

24:21.668 --> 24:26.840
from the beginning to now, we're totally--
we look at this differently.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.843
"Spark joy," that really is a...

24:30.677 --> 24:31.678
a real thing.

24:31.761 --> 24:35.974
It actually brought about changes
that we really didn't expect.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.309
That's true. That's true.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.313
Truly. Truly.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.192
There actually is a side bonus
to all of this

24:45.442 --> 24:47.736
and the side bonus is that...

24:48.278 --> 24:50.405
um, we're working together.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.742
Right, are you putting small,
big, how are you doing it?

24:53.825 --> 24:56.995
Just anyway you can, but obviously
you don't wanna put smalls on the bottom.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.206
It's kinda fun, actually.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.833
What're you gonna do up there?
'Cause that's all gonna come out.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.961
I think we still wanna put some
of the photographs and stuff up there.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.632
From de-cluttering and cleaning
and working with Marie,

25:08.840 --> 25:12.928
that Ron and Wendy are actually are
working together on a project like this,

25:13.386 --> 25:14.221
it's kinda cool.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.640
- Okay.
- So, I think we're done.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.439
<i>We can see the endgame right now.</i>

25:24.523 --> 25:26.816
<i>And before it was kinda like,</i>
<i>"How are we gonna do it?"</i>

25:27.234 --> 25:28.985
Because there was just
so much stuff in there.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.364
<i>But now we've made tremendous progress</i>
<i>and we're gonna continue.</i>

25:32.447 --> 25:37.369
<i>And so my motivation is</i>
<i>I never want to have to do this again.</i>

25:37.786 --> 25:43.208
<i>We estimated, what,</i>
<i>150 bags of trash have left this house.</i>

25:43.917 --> 25:45.418
A hundred and fifty.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.797
Okay, so where do you want to start?
Top shelves or bottom shelves?

25:48.880 --> 25:49.714
Um...

25:49.798 --> 25:50.924
-Probably top shelves.
-Yeah.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.551
Yeah. So-- Is that hair?

25:53.343 --> 25:55.387
- What does it say?
- "Russell."

25:55.470 --> 25:56.805
Yeah, it's Russell's hair.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.682
-First haircut.
- First haircut. Okay.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.183
Nana kept that?!

26:04.020 --> 26:04.896
Holy crap.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.482
This is April 1966.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.192
Does that even look like me?

26:11.027 --> 26:12.445
-That's you?
-Yep.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.656
<i>I mean, it almost looks like Russell.</i>

26:15.031 --> 26:16.032
<i>Wow.</i>

26:16.116 --> 26:19.953
There's gonna be a lotta things that we're
gonna find I know that are precious to us

26:20.036 --> 26:23.498
and we have to come up
with a way to store them.

26:23.582 --> 26:28.878
What we need to do is make a pile
of photos that we're gonna come back to.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.385
When tidying photos,

26:35.635 --> 26:41.600
you must believe in your ability to know
what sparks joy for you.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.560
Let's go through each one, one by one.

26:44.686 --> 26:45.729
This one sparks joy.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.147
This one doesn't.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.189
This one does.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.357
This one doesn't.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.152
If you have similar photos,

26:52.235 --> 26:55.405
keep the one that sparks the most joy.

26:57.198 --> 27:03.663
Photos can be stored in a box.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.125
My recommendation is
to store them in an album.

27:07.500 --> 27:11.254
This makes it easier
to enjoy the memories.

27:11.588 --> 27:15.467
Some places to store your albums are
on bookshelves and coffee tables.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.011
Please find a spot
that sparks joy for you.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.014
Okay.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.560
We kinda were thinking of the stages

27:25.644 --> 27:29.564
and the sentimental was
definitely a part of the stage that

27:29.648 --> 27:31.608
<i>I was looking forward to, honestly,</i>

27:31.775 --> 27:36.279
<i>'cause I really wanted to see some of this</i>
<i>old stuff that I either have never seen</i>

27:36.363 --> 27:39.574
<i>or haven't seen for a long time,</i>
<i>and by a long time I'm talking...</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:41.660
-Fifty years.
-Yeah, fifty years.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.745
I'm pretty sure this was my father's.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.830
- Hmm.
-When I started looking into it,

27:47.082 --> 27:49.834
this is December 7th, 1941.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.128
-That was Pearl Harbor.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.465
And then he begins to tell

27:55.548 --> 27:58.885
that they were gonna be interned
at Santa Anita Racetrack.

27:58.968 --> 28:01.221
And what happened to them, you know,

28:01.304 --> 28:03.098
right after the break of World War II.
So...

28:05.850 --> 28:08.186
This is an item
that should be cherished.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.813
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.690
<i>There's a lot of memories</i>
<i>in this house.</i>

28:11.773 --> 28:15.443
<i>There's a lot of emotional stuff</i>
<i>that we found that took us back.</i>

28:15.527 --> 28:19.030
<i>You know, we've found more things</i>
<i>that have brought value to us</i>

28:19.114 --> 28:21.032
<i>that are worth absolutely nothing</i>
<i>to anybody else,</i>

28:21.116 --> 28:22.701
<i>but to us, they're worth a ton.</i>

28:23.243 --> 28:25.704
And we wouldn't have found that stuff,

28:26.454 --> 28:27.372
um...

28:27.956 --> 28:29.708
if we didn't start this process.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.137
- Did you dust these?

28:42.262 --> 28:43.596
Yeah, more or less, but...

28:44.097 --> 28:46.808
Don't-- you know, you're gonna create
more work than you want

28:46.891 --> 28:47.851
if you start doing that.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.728
-There's the door.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.062
Um...

28:57.527 --> 28:59.738
-<i>Konnichiwa!</i>
-Hi! <i>Konnichiwa!</i>

28:59.821 --> 29:02.198
-How are you?
-Hello. Hi.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.951
I think we're gonna show you
the garage first.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.287
- Oh, great idea.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.332
-Wendy-san!
-Marie!

29:11.416 --> 29:12.667
-How are you?
-Good.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.793
Good to see you.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.299
-This is a completely different room.
- Yes, even from last week, right?

29:21.259 --> 29:23.344
- <i>You did this all in a week?</i>
- <i>Yeah, yes.</i>

29:23.428 --> 29:24.471
<i>Amazing!</i>

29:24.554 --> 29:27.182
Those are some dolls
I found in a box.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.392
- How do you say "doll"?
- <i>Kokeshi.</i>

29:29.476 --> 29:30.727
<i>Kokeshi</i> dolls.

29:30.810 --> 29:34.147
Morioka, Sendai, Mizusawa, the reindeer.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.941
- Look at all the tiny ones!

29:37.025 --> 29:38.443
-They're so cute.
-Aren't they cute?

29:38.526 --> 29:40.069
We had no idea these existed.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.280
It was hidden in one of the cabinets.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.868
It brings me joy
just to see this in the garage,

29:46.951 --> 29:49.412
that you have space to display this now.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.955
All through this process,

29:51.039 --> 29:53.458
I was stepping back, going,
"How did we let it get to this?"

29:53.541 --> 29:56.044
<i>Or "How did this happen?"</i>
<i>Or "How did that happen?"</i>

29:56.127 --> 29:58.129
<i>And, man, I can't leave anything</i>
<i>around anymore.</i>

29:58.213 --> 30:00.840
I mean it's like, "Why's that
in the middle of the living room?"

30:00.924 --> 30:02.425
"Why is that there? Why is that there?"

30:02.509 --> 30:06.846
So it's definitely changing us
and I have to say it's for the better.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.019
<i>Here's my office!</i>

30:14.604 --> 30:16.940
-Can you believe it? Look at this.
-Wendy-san!

30:17.398 --> 30:20.652
So, see? We did it.

30:23.738 --> 30:27.158
<i>And then here's workspace here,</i>
<i>workspace there.</i>

30:27.951 --> 30:29.452
<i>Ron and I, we thought, "You know what?</i>

30:29.536 --> 30:32.205
<i>this would be a good place</i>
<i>to store the photo boxes."</i>

30:36.417 --> 30:38.419
- <i>What happened to all the shoes?</i>
- <i>Ah!</i>

30:38.503 --> 30:40.463
<i>Oh, I'll show you. We moved everything.</i>

30:40.547 --> 30:46.678
Alright, so here, now we have more of
the clothing all in the Mount Wendy room.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.682
<i>I know, little by little,</i>

30:50.765 --> 30:52.976
<i>this is turning into being</i>
<i>a walk-in closet.</i>

30:55.937 --> 30:59.649
-Okay, so here is Ron's space.
- Ah.

30:59.732 --> 31:00.984
<i>Workspace.</i>

31:02.610 --> 31:04.320
- <i>I love it.</i>

31:11.035 --> 31:14.289
<i>This is all that's left</i>
<i>after the big mountain.</i>

31:16.124 --> 31:19.752
The whole KonMari philosophy
and everything, I think, really has

31:19.836 --> 31:22.505
played a key into the way
that we're looking at stuff.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.176
Yeah, I think this is
a very good volume

31:27.260 --> 31:29.345
-that you can calmly look through.
-Yes.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.473
<i>There's a value to our possessions</i>

31:32.557 --> 31:35.768
<i>that maybe I didn't feel</i>
<i>that I had before.</i>

31:35.852 --> 31:38.354
So if I have, um...

31:39.522 --> 31:42.817
ten baseball cards as opposed
to 1,000 baseball cards,

31:42.901 --> 31:47.322
I'm gonna treasure those ten
baseball cards more than if I had 1,000.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.866
That's really huge coming from him
because, really,

31:49.949 --> 31:54.370
for him to cross over,
you know, into the light

31:54.662 --> 31:56.539
is huge, it's huge.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.167
Okay, yeah, so, I just want to say that.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.260
<i>Ah, look how clean this room is.</i>

32:15.266 --> 32:16.851
<i>And so here's a picture.</i>

32:16.935 --> 32:19.771
If you stand right here, this is the view.

32:19.854 --> 32:22.565
- How many years ago was this?

32:22.649 --> 32:25.026
<i>This is probably a good 20 years ago.</i>

32:27.028 --> 32:27.862
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:32.158 --> 32:34.577
Really, just everything
that has been placed here,

32:34.661 --> 32:37.580
it's just transformed the feeling
in this whole room.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.458
-It's so different.
-Oh, thank you. Yeah, we feel it, too.

32:40.541 --> 32:45.046
I can feel a change in the atmosphere
of the house.

32:45.588 --> 32:48.591
<i>It feels lighter, it feels more positive.</i>

32:49.425 --> 32:54.347
And actually, to me, is probably
the first step in de-stressing

32:54.430 --> 32:57.225
and moving forward, you know,
into our retirement years.

32:58.601 --> 33:01.479
I'm just struggling
to find the right words

33:01.562 --> 33:03.898
because I'm so moved right now.

33:04.565 --> 33:07.777
Because these past six weeks,

33:07.860 --> 33:11.698
both of you have so seriously confronted

33:11.781 --> 33:16.202
not just your possessions, but your
own lives and yourselves as well,

33:16.285 --> 33:18.079
and I'm just so moved.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.873
That's what I'm, you know,
most proud about her.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.291
She's a good partner.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.044
We did put in some long hours some days.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.842
So on our very first day together,
I asked,

33:30.925 --> 33:33.720
"What is our ideal vision
for your life together"?

33:33.803 --> 33:36.389
And, Ron, you mentioned
"happy wife, happy life."

33:36.472 --> 33:38.057
Do you think you've accomplished that?

33:38.141 --> 33:40.935
Yeah, I think we accomplished
happy wife, happy life.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.565
She's my girl, she's always been my girl,
she'll always be my girl.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.942
There were times where
it was a little hard...

33:48.776 --> 33:50.903
and, um, we came through it.

33:50.987 --> 33:51.988
Here we go, guys.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.990
First game of pool,

33:54.073 --> 33:55.491
in I don't know how many years.

33:55.575 --> 33:59.996
He partnered with me on this
and, you know, went all in.

34:00.079 --> 34:03.166
And that is, you know, really something.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.169
You know, thanks.
I was really, really thankful for that.

34:07.754 --> 34:11.049
Oh, my God. I do not believe that!

34:11.132 --> 34:14.469
This really has been
a fun thing for us to do.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.220
We've laughed a lot.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.057
He's sandbagging me!

34:19.140 --> 34:20.266
<i>I think that both of us,</i>

34:20.349 --> 34:22.769
we have gotten closer and it's brought
a lot of joy in my life.

34:22.852 --> 34:25.313
Oh, my gosh,
these flowers are beautiful!

34:25.396 --> 34:26.439
Look at those.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.982
<i>And now we're thinking</i>

34:28.649 --> 34:32.737
there really isn't any other task
that we couldn't do together.

34:36.407 --> 34:40.620
Congratulations for successfully
completing the KonMari Method of tidying.

34:40.703 --> 34:41.913
You've graduated!

34:41.996 --> 34:44.207
We graduated! Yay! Oh, my gosh!

34:44.290 --> 34:47.835
I'm very, very happy
with the results and...

34:48.127 --> 34:53.966
um, I can honestly say that it's gonna
change the way I view possessions,

34:54.050 --> 34:55.093
it's gonna change the way--

34:55.176 --> 34:57.929
Actually, the way that I, you know,
proceed with the rest of my life.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.100
