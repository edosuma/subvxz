Marla didn't want
to turn on the vacuum

19:37.677 --> 19:38.978
and make a lot of noise,
so she crawled around

19:39.011 --> 19:40.747
for an hour or so
and picked up about

19:40.780 --> 19:44.384
two or three pocketfuls
of dirt off the floor.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.819
We never figured out how to
turn the water back on,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.688
so we had to poop
in a plastic bag.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.490
But we took it with us.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.991
We're not animals.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.262
**

19:59.766 --> 20:03.703
* Nobody's gonna love you
like I do *

20:03.736 --> 20:05.004
* You can count on that, honey

20:05.037 --> 20:09.342
* Nobody's gonna love you
like I do *

20:09.376 --> 20:10.610
* Oh, isn't that funny?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.812
* So what you gonna do
without me? *

20:12.845 --> 20:16.283
* Are you going
to settle down? *

20:16.316 --> 20:19.786
* Ain't nobody like me's
gonna come around *

20:25.458 --> 20:27.994
[ Touchscreen clicking ]

20:28.027 --> 20:29.962
[ Bloop, chime ]

20:29.996 --> 20:32.899
* I won't give back my lovin'

20:32.932 --> 20:41.441
* And I wouldn't take it
if you asked me to *
[ Brakes squeal,
air brakes hiss ]

20:41.474 --> 20:43.443
* But you'll get
a pretty penny *

20:43.476 --> 20:50.883
* You'll trade it in
for something new *

20:50.917 --> 20:52.051
Hello?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.354
Is this God's country?

20:54.387 --> 20:58.391
That's what the poster says.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.692
Perfect.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.629
I think he wants me
to meet him here.
