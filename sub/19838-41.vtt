00:02.070 --> 00:03.140
<b>Gungi?</b>

00:03.840 --> 00:07.760
<b>For the past fifteen years, 
there have been world tournaments,</b>

00:08.420 --> 00:11.250
<b>and East Gorteau has yet to lose.</b>

00:11.890 --> 00:16.160
<b>Currently, they're on their third representative, 
a five-time reigning champion.</b>

00:17.880 --> 00:21.410
<b>Then, if I defeat this champion, 
I'll be the best in the world?</b>

00:21.790 --> 00:24.250
<b>A fitting way to end this recreation.</b>

00:25.400 --> 00:26.710
<b>Bring them in.</b>

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
<b>Check x And x Mate</b>

01:55.890 --> 02:00.510
<b>Six days remain before 
Neferpitou begins the selection.</b>

02:00.510 --> 02:04.010
<b>The King has spent this time in his palace,</b>

02:04.010 --> 02:07.980
<b>defeating the masters of shogi, 
Go, and other board games.</b>

02:07.980 --> 02:11.580
<b>The last remaining one, 
the reigning Gungi world champion,</b>

02:11.580 --> 02:13.770
<b>has just been summoned to his side.</b>

02:24.430 --> 02:26.060
<b>U-Um...</b>

02:26.060 --> 02:29.290
<b>Th-Thank you for infighting meâ€”</b>

02:29.290 --> 02:30.700
<b>For inciting me...</b>

02:30.700 --> 02:32.170
<b>No need for small talk.</b>

02:33.180 --> 02:35.610
<b>You and I will play Gungi.</b>

02:36.140 --> 02:39.430
<b>Right now, I am learning the 
rules, so you must wait.</b>

02:40.420 --> 02:45.130
<b>Huh? You don't sound like the Supreme Leader.</b>

02:45.650 --> 02:47.130
<b>He's dead.</b>

02:47.670 --> 02:49.440
<b>Now I am the King.</b>

02:49.730 --> 02:52.390
<b>I'm s-so sorry!</b>

02:52.390 --> 02:53.940
<b>Please forgive me!</b>

02:54.400 --> 03:00.790
<b>I'm only a fool, one who knows 
nothing of the outside world!</b>

03:00.790 --> 03:03.780
<b>I can't even talk normally...</b>

03:03.780 --> 03:05.830
<b>You are distracting me. Be silent.</b>

03:06.570 --> 03:07.580
<b>Or I'll kill you.</b>

03:21.990 --> 03:24.300
<b>Okay, I basically understand.</b>

03:25.800 --> 03:26.970
<b>Let us begin.</b>

03:30.420 --> 03:31.690
<b>What's wrong?</b>

03:33.020 --> 03:34.690
<b>It appears she's passed out.</b>

03:35.520 --> 03:38.670
<b>After you told her to be quiet, 
she shut her mouth...</b>

03:38.670 --> 03:43.580
<b>Then, since her nose was stuffed up, 
it seems she was unable to breathe.</b>

03:44.700 --> 03:46.950
<b>This is an uncommonly stupid girl.</b>

03:47.530 --> 03:50.700
<b>Yeah, that was embarrassing!</b>

03:51.090 --> 03:55.830
<b>I can't even do things a baby can.</b>

03:55.830 --> 03:58.560
<b>My parents are always yelling at me...</b>

03:59.810 --> 04:01.460
<b>Just play the game.</b>

04:01.460 --> 04:01.970
<b>Yes!</b>

04:02.430 --> 04:05.330
<b>I'm honored to play against you.</b>

04:19.260 --> 04:22.760
<b>You can see with your eyes?</b>

04:22.760 --> 04:25.290
<b>No, I can't see a thing.</b>

04:25.290 --> 04:28.490
<b>So would you please tell me your moves?</b>

04:29.490 --> 04:33.030
<b>I only open them when I play.</b>

04:33.030 --> 04:36.490
<b>If it bothers you, I can try to close them...</b>

04:37.050 --> 04:38.500
<b>I don't care.</b>

04:42.670 --> 04:45.760
<b><i>The atmosphere has changed.</i></b>

04:52.120 --> 04:54.640
<b>4-4-1, pawn.</b>

04:59.010 --> 05:01.610
<b>You can't reach him at all?</b>

05:01.610 --> 05:03.900
<b>No, I guess his phone is off.</b>

05:04.580 --> 05:08.530
<b>We agreed that he would initiate all contact,</b>

05:08.530 --> 05:10.530
<b>so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.</b>

05:11.010 --> 05:15.410
<b>Damn, then we have to wait for him to call?</b>

05:16.570 --> 05:21.420
<b><i>Why does that guy look like he 
was born in the wrong decade?</i></b>

05:21.970 --> 05:27.050
<b><i>And the look on his face says 
he's always looking for a fight...</i></b>

05:27.920 --> 05:29.890
<b><i>The other has no eyebrows,</i></b>

05:29.890 --> 05:36.030
<b><i>and that expression makes it 
clear that he trusts no one.</i></b>

05:36.030 --> 05:39.120
<b><i>It's not even a question of 
whether he and I can get along.</i></b>

05:39.120 --> 05:44.320
<b><i>I can already see he won't believe a word I say.</i></b>

05:44.900 --> 05:49.520
<b><i>Gon, I'm sorry to say that my 
first impression is very bad!</i></b>

05:49.520 --> 05:52.460
<b><i>Unless I get some really good news soon,</i></b>

05:52.460 --> 05:56.070
<b><i>there's no way I'll be able to trust them.</i></b>

05:56.070 --> 05:57.960
<b><i>I guarantee it.</i></b>

06:05.450 --> 06:07.460
<b>Hey, what's all this?</b>

06:07.460 --> 06:10.670
<b>Beats me. Just a pack of strays, I guess.</b>

06:10.670 --> 06:12.350
<b>They have collars...</b>

06:12.900 --> 06:18.840
<b>He's been feeding all the animals 
left behind due to the selection.</b>

06:19.490 --> 06:21.360
<b>He's even sacrificed sleep...</b>

06:21.650 --> 06:23.360
<b>I'm not feeding all of them!</b>

06:23.730 --> 06:28.360
<b>I know we don't have time to waste on that!</b>

06:28.360 --> 06:31.600
<b>So I abandoned those that stood no chance.</b>

06:31.600 --> 06:32.830
<b>That's efficient, yeah?</b>

06:33.290 --> 06:36.950
<b>Some were just skin and bones, 
but still wouldn't take my food.</b>

06:37.320 --> 06:43.280
<b>Some were so loyal, they wouldn't leave 
their homes after I untied them...</b>

06:43.280 --> 06:47.720
<b>What's so bad about saving 
the ones that want the help?!</b>

06:52.640 --> 06:55.110
<b>You don't have to cry about it.</b>

06:55.110 --> 06:57.400
<b>I'm n-not crying, fool!</b>

06:57.400 --> 06:58.980
<b>Want me to smack you?</b>

07:04.480 --> 07:07.480
<b><i>That won't be enough to raise my opinion.</i></b>

07:08.820 --> 07:11.090
<b><i>Well, he certainly is different, though.</i></b>

07:26.610 --> 07:29.580
<b>7-8-2, spy.</b>

07:29.580 --> 07:30.760
<b>Checkmate.</b>

07:32.480 --> 07:37.810
<b><i>She's using an orthodox approach, 
stacking archers on her pawns.</i></b>

07:37.810 --> 07:40.020
<b><i>A standard strategy.</i></b>

07:41.030 --> 07:43.900
<b><i>Textbook execution.</i></b>

07:44.790 --> 07:47.780
<b><i>And her initial placement 
is one used with beginners.</i></b>

07:48.590 --> 07:54.030
<b><i>Meaning that I am not good enough 
for her to show her true skill.</i></b>

07:56.080 --> 07:57.280
<b>Another game.</b>

07:58.020 --> 08:00.410
<b>Yes, absolutely!</b>

08:07.990 --> 08:10.650
<b>8-8-1, knight.</b>

08:14.310 --> 08:15.550
<b>I guess that's checkmate.</b>

08:16.110 --> 08:21.600
<b>You're such a fast learner, Supreme Leader.</b>

08:22.630 --> 08:27.360
<b>I'll have to step up my game, 
or you'll get the jump on me!</b>

08:27.770 --> 08:30.570
<b>That's enough... Go get some rest.</b>

08:31.820 --> 08:35.390
<b>That isn't necessary... I'm just fine.</b>

08:35.390 --> 08:39.120
<b>I can play Gungi for three days 
and nights without sleep!</b>

08:39.120 --> 08:41.200
<b>I have another guest.</b>

08:41.200 --> 08:44.480
<b>Once I've finished with him, it'll be your turn.</b>

08:46.740 --> 08:50.730
<b>Then I'll get a little rest.</b>

09:02.070 --> 09:03.940
<b>What do you think?</b>

09:03.940 --> 09:05.850
<b>It's but a matter of time.</b>

09:06.720 --> 09:08.700
<b>There are more options to choose from,</b>

09:08.700 --> 09:11.360
<b>but essentially, this game is 
no different than the rest.</b>

09:12.140 --> 09:16.240
<b>In four or five more games, she will 
have to use her real ability.</b>

09:17.430 --> 09:20.330
<b>Once that happens, I shall be 
able to observe her rhythm.</b>

09:20.330 --> 09:22.240
<b>Nothing has changed.</b>

09:25.360 --> 09:26.500
<b>Your Majesty,</b>

09:27.490 --> 09:30.000
<b>the Go player hanged himself.</b>

09:37.190 --> 09:40.110
<b>Bring that idiot back.</b>

09:49.050 --> 09:55.000
<b>While the King continues to play 
against the Gungi master,</b>

09:55.840 --> 10:01.670
<b>a short distance away, Morel has 
been using his power to surround</b>

10:01.670 --> 10:04.790
<b>the capital city of Peijing.</b>

10:11.400 --> 10:13.420
<b>Purple Haze Soldiers 
Deep Purple</b>

10:11.640 --> 10:13.420
<b><i>Deep Purple.</i></b>

10:20.470 --> 10:23.180
<b>First, he releases the aura that serves as a core.</b>

10:24.930 --> 10:27.920
<b>He then envelops it in an aura haze,</b>

10:27.920 --> 10:35.750
<b>creating a smoke puppet that he can 
control at will via the <i>Nen</i> within the core.</b>

10:35.750 --> 10:39.450
<b>His ability can sustain two hundred 
and sixteen puppets at once.</b>

10:41.440 --> 10:46.930
<b><i>On the chance that the enemy retaliates, 
I've made my soldiers more responsive,</i></b>

10:46.930 --> 10:49.960
<b><i>so I can only maintain fifty now.</i></b>

10:49.960 --> 10:51.960
<b><i>But they're much stronger.</i></b>

10:53.210 --> 10:56.980
<b><i>One advantage is that </i>En<i> can't differentiate</i></b>

10:56.980 --> 10:59.260
<b><i>between one of these and a human.</i></b>

11:01.940 --> 11:05.480
<b><i>But at heart, Chimera Ants are still ants.</i></b>

11:05.480 --> 11:07.820
<b><i>So Neferpitou won't leave the King's side.</i></b>

11:07.820 --> 11:11.840
<b><i>As expected, Neferpitou has recalled 
the controlled humans to the capital</i></b>

11:11.840 --> 11:14.060
<b><i>to take up defensive positions.</i></b>

11:14.520 --> 11:21.070
<b><i>That implies the King's safety is top priority.</i></b>

11:21.940 --> 11:25.830
<b><i>Which means that restricting the movement 
of the Royal Guard is very easy.</i></b>

11:25.830 --> 11:29.830
<b><i>However, the question is how the King will respond.</i></b>

11:30.790 --> 11:35.590
<b><i>If we're dealing with a King who does as he 
likes, it'll be harder to anticipate him.</i></b>

11:35.590 --> 11:38.340
<b><i>And the risk of miscalculation increases.</i></b>

11:39.680 --> 11:42.970
<b><i>But as long as they keep 
these coming, we're fine.</i></b>

11:51.920 --> 11:53.230
<b>Long time, no see.</b>

11:53.900 --> 11:55.480
<b>I've been looking for you.</b>

11:55.880 --> 11:58.480
<b><i>Bah, he's gotten stronger.</i></b>

11:59.360 --> 12:01.850
<b><i>The air about him feels totally different.</i></b>

12:02.840 --> 12:05.870
<b><i>Knuckle's APR is gone?</i></b>

12:05.870 --> 12:08.490
<b><i>It doesn't appear to have become IRS, either.</i></b>

12:09.050 --> 12:13.450
<b><i>If something had happened, 
Knuckle's group would have contacted me.</i></b>

12:14.650 --> 12:17.530
<b><i>If APR is gone,</i></b>

12:17.530 --> 12:20.010
<b><i>they have someone who can dispel</i> Nen.</b>

12:20.310 --> 12:23.830
<b><i>Or did he do it himself?</i></b>

12:26.550 --> 12:28.640
<b><i>Let's see what they can do.</i></b>

12:29.250 --> 12:31.140
<b><i>Whichever wins...</i></b>

12:31.140 --> 12:33.390
<b><i>In the end,</i></b>

12:33.950 --> 12:35.490
<b><i>I will triumph.</i></b>

12:36.750 --> 12:38.400
<b>Time to return the favor.</b>

12:39.350 --> 12:41.780
<b>First, I'll beat you down.</b>

12:43.350 --> 12:45.330
<b>Then it's the pompadour's turn.</b>

12:46.370 --> 12:49.540
<b><i>His confidence is far from baseless.</i></b>

12:50.230 --> 12:53.390
<b><i>He must have gained a new ability.</i></b>

12:53.390 --> 12:55.170
<b>I wouldn't be so certain!</b>

12:58.580 --> 13:02.670
<b><i>If that ability is to exorcise</i> Nen, 
<i>we're in trouble.</i></b>

13:03.700 --> 13:07.820
<b><i>Knuckle and Shoot both use 
hit-and-fade fighting styles.</i></b>

13:08.380 --> 13:12.000
<b><i>Shoot does what he can to support 
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.</i></b>

13:13.160 --> 13:17.570
<b><i>But we can't nullify their</i> Nen <i>with ours</i></b>

13:17.570 --> 13:21.370
<b><i>if they have someone who can dispel it.</i></b>

13:22.660 --> 13:27.490
<b><i>A strategy that might have worked 
against the King is useless now.</i></b>

13:27.990 --> 13:28.870
<b><i>However...</i></b>

13:29.470 --> 13:34.980
<b><i>if he has the ability to exorcise</i> Nen, 
<i>this is a good opportunity.</i></b>

13:34.980 --> 13:38.880
<b><i>If I neutralize him here, Knuckle 
and Shoot can use their powers.</i></b>

13:42.540 --> 13:44.090
<b><i>I must fight...</i></b>

13:44.730 --> 13:50.390
<b><i>I can't drop Deep Purple, so I'll have 
to get by on my remaining aura.</i></b>

13:57.270 --> 13:58.900
<b><i>What?</i></b>

13:58.900 --> 14:02.400
<b><i>He's still relying on speed?</i></b>

14:03.140 --> 14:07.280
<b><i>There are plenty of ways to deal with 
someone who only uses speed.</i></b>

14:08.630 --> 14:10.660
<b>Now you're "It."</b>

14:11.100 --> 14:13.160
<b>Huh? What was that?</b>

14:28.260 --> 14:30.930
<b><i>Wh-Where am I?</i></b>

14:30.930 --> 14:32.360
<b><i>A savannah?</i></b>

14:32.870 --> 14:35.430
<b><i>Did he teleport me?</i></b>

14:35.970 --> 14:38.250
<b><i>If this is his new ability,</i></b>

14:38.250 --> 14:40.900
<b><i>a different Chimera Ant is the</i> Nen <i>exorcist.</i></b>

14:40.900 --> 14:42.440
<b><i>That's bad.</i></b>

14:42.800 --> 14:44.690
<b>Sure you should just be standing around?</b>

14:46.360 --> 14:47.570
<b>It's time to start</b>

14:47.980 --> 14:49.640
<b>this game of tag.</b>

14:49.640 --> 14:51.570
<b>Tag?</b>

14:52.300 --> 14:55.120
<b>We're in a field that I created.</b>

14:55.120 --> 14:59.330
<b>Unless you touch me, you can't leave.</b>

15:04.360 --> 15:06.260
<b>Your time limit is eight hours.</b>

15:07.270 --> 15:09.260
<b>Let's start!</b>

15:19.600 --> 15:20.640
<b>Hey!</b>

15:21.050 --> 15:23.510
<b>Didn't you hear what I said?</b>

15:23.510 --> 15:27.150
<b>You can't leave without touching me!</b>

15:28.070 --> 15:31.910
<b>If I chase you, I'll never catch you.</b>

15:32.510 --> 15:35.410
<b>So I'm going to take my time.</b>

15:42.160 --> 15:44.790
<b><i>Morel disappeared with the enemy!</i></b>

15:49.730 --> 15:52.550
<b><i>Cheetu has activated his power...</i></b>

15:53.230 --> 15:58.560
<b><i>I don't know what it does, but they 
won't be back for eight hours.</i></b>

16:02.620 --> 16:04.560
<b><i>The scenery is just a wall.</i></b>

16:05.180 --> 16:10.940
<b><i>Looks like I'm in some kind of space 
separated from the real world, like he said.</i></b>

16:12.240 --> 16:16.200
<b><i>Seems to be about the size of a baseball field.</i></b>

16:16.990 --> 16:23.210
<b><i>If I stopped Deep Purple, I could 
break out of here with ease.</i></b>

16:23.210 --> 16:24.550
<b><i>However...</i></b>

16:24.550 --> 16:29.980
<b><i>First, is it even possible for me to stop 
Deep Purple from within this space?</i></b>

16:29.980 --> 16:33.790
<b><i>Second, if I'm able to stop it,</i></b>

16:33.790 --> 16:37.460
<b><i>will that aura return to me here, in this space?</i></b>

16:38.030 --> 16:43.740
<b><i>The worst scenario would be one 
in which I stop Deep Purple,</i></b>

16:43.740 --> 16:45.840
<b><i>but the aura can't reach me in this space.</i></b>

16:47.000 --> 16:49.370
<b><i>Once Deep Purple is halted,</i></b>

16:49.370 --> 16:53.630
<b><i>it can't be reactivated until 
I've recovered the aura.</i></b>

16:54.160 --> 16:56.740
<b><i>It's too risky to try.</i></b>

17:01.390 --> 17:03.870
<b><i>I can't stop Deep Purple.</i></b>

17:04.360 --> 17:07.130
<b><i>At least, not yet.</i></b>

17:07.610 --> 17:09.880
<b>Are you finally ready to start?</b>

17:13.300 --> 17:17.680
<b>This way! Follow my lead!</b>

17:23.650 --> 17:26.570
<b>Hold on, you aren't gonna...</b>

17:26.570 --> 17:29.690
<b>You bet I am!</b>

17:37.830 --> 17:39.300
<b>It's a waste of time.</b>

17:39.300 --> 17:41.660
<b>You can't destroy the walls or the hourglass.</b>

17:42.510 --> 17:45.540
<b>There's only one way out.</b>

17:45.540 --> 17:48.420
<b>And that's to catch me.</b>

17:50.910 --> 17:52.920
<b><i>I can tell that</i></b>

17:53.310 --> 17:56.930
<b><i>Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy 
has weakened his power...</i></b>

17:57.860 --> 17:58.920
<b><i>So then...</i></b>

17:59.920 --> 18:05.010
<b>Hey, what happens if I don't touch 
you within the time limit?</b>

18:05.540 --> 18:06.940
<b>Who knows?</b>

18:07.260 --> 18:09.940
<b>I have no obligation to answer that question.</b>

18:10.370 --> 18:12.730
<b>Naturally, of course not.</b>

18:12.730 --> 18:15.790
<b><i>It appears there's more to this ability.</i></b>

18:16.460 --> 18:18.820
<b><i>I'm in for the long haul, then.</i></b>

18:21.920 --> 18:24.580
<b>Wake me up in five hours.</b>

18:26.170 --> 18:27.830
<b>Are you mocking me?</b>

18:35.060 --> 18:37.380
<b><i>Go ahead, lose your temper.</i></b>

18:37.380 --> 18:41.350
<b><i>It seems you don't understand your own power.</i></b>

18:42.440 --> 18:45.350
<b><i>This isn't a battle of speed.</i></b>

18:46.740 --> 18:49.300
<b><i>It's a battle of mental fortitude.</i></b>

18:53.300 --> 18:56.380
<b><i>Deep Purple is still active...</i></b>

19:01.540 --> 19:03.960
<b><i>So the operation continues.</i></b>

19:07.120 --> 19:11.880
<b>Leol-sama, I've discovered another enemy.</b>

19:13.290 --> 19:16.990
<b>It's a man in a suit, with black hair and glasses.</b>

19:16.990 --> 19:18.380
<b>Anyone else around?</b>

19:18.730 --> 19:22.890
<b>No, just the figures in white.</b>

19:23.510 --> 19:27.600
<b><i>Those white figures are probably ordinary soldiers.</i></b>

19:27.600 --> 19:32.130
<b><i>But it's possible that the true leader 
is concealed among them.</i></b>

19:33.520 --> 19:38.280
<b><i>And I can't let anyone see my power.</i></b>

19:38.850 --> 19:41.960
<b><i>And Hirin is occupied with 
exorcising the </i>Nen<i> on Cheetu...</i></b>

19:41.960 --> 19:43.030
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

19:43.500 --> 19:46.520
<b><i>I need at least two more pawns!</i></b>

19:48.590 --> 19:53.520
<b>Okay, but in return, you have to defeat him.</b>

19:53.520 --> 19:56.550
<b>The King is nearly finished playing games.</b>

19:56.930 --> 20:01.120
<b>After that, the King will insist on 
defeating his enemies himself.</b>

20:01.600 --> 20:06.680
<b>We will be there to guard him, but 
you never know what might happen...</b>

20:07.210 --> 20:12.190
<b>We would rather the King remain 
inside until the selection is over.</b>

20:14.440 --> 20:16.320
<b>Do you need something?</b>

20:16.320 --> 20:18.750
<b>Give Leol a hand.</b>

20:18.750 --> 20:21.250
<b>Yes, as you wish.</b>

20:26.900 --> 20:28.280
<b>Well?</b>

20:28.280 --> 20:31.450
<b>I am becoming worried.</b>

20:32.700 --> 20:36.320
<b>They've played many times, but 
the King is nowhere near victory.</b>

20:38.790 --> 20:41.330
<b>This player is a true master...</b>

20:45.040 --> 20:49.040
<b><i>I should have been able to break 
her defenses from the left side.</i></b>

20:49.040 --> 20:53.850
<b><i>But she used a peculiar move 
sequence to turn the tables.</i></b>

20:56.390 --> 20:58.980
<b>4-5-1, musketeer.</b>

21:02.700 --> 21:05.610
<b>2-8-2, fortress.</b>

21:06.560 --> 21:07.620
<b><i>What?</i></b>

21:08.290 --> 21:11.930
<b><i>The spy has done nothing this entire match...</i></b>

21:11.930 --> 21:14.370
<b><i>But suddenly, it controls the board!</i></b>

21:15.700 --> 21:18.630
<b><i>My right side's been destroyed.</i></b>

21:20.390 --> 21:22.580
<b>I'm done. That's checkmate.</b>

21:25.160 --> 21:25.880
<b><i>Impossible.</i></b>

21:27.110 --> 21:30.390
<b><i>From start to checkmate, there were 
one hundred, forty-four moves.</i></b>

21:30.390 --> 21:34.590
<b><i>This outcome could have only happened 
if she foresaw each of my moves.</i></b>

21:35.560 --> 21:36.770
<b>On to the next game.</b>

21:37.750 --> 21:38.770
<b>Yes!</b>

21:39.940 --> 21:41.980
<b><i>This is utterly impossible!</i></b>

21:46.540 --> 21:48.030
<b>A storm is brewing.</b>

21:49.390 --> 21:52.740
<b>The girl's strength upsets the King.</b>

21:52.740 --> 21:56.040
<b>And a storm draws near the palace.</b>

23:24.630 --> 23:27.290
<b>Next time: Doubt x And x Hesitation.</b>

23:27.290 --> 23:29.650
<b>Please go easy on us.</b>

23:29.650 --> 23:30.420
<b>Clack.</b>

23:30.420 --> 23:31.130
<b>Whack.</b>

23:31.130 --> 23:32.090
<b>Whoosh.</b>

23:32.090 --> 23:33.030
<b>Clang.</b>

23:33.030 --> 23:34.260
<b>Checkmate.</b>
