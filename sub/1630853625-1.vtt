we did that recon mission

I didn't say anything.
Goldfarb decided to...

22:39.797 --> 22:42.160
set up camp in a clearing.

22:43.999 --> 22:49.365
I guess I dozed off. Next thing
I know, everyone around me hit

22:49.400 --> 22:53.611
the ground, but I knew
what was happening.

Hey, seriously!

1:03:42.521 --> 1:03:44.752
- You said you had a bag.

1:04:02.574 --> 1:04:06.345
- Are you at all
curious what this is?

1:04:06.380 --> 1:04:09.018
All of this?
- I know.

1:04:09.053 --> 1:04:12.615
- What is it?
- We're sleepwalking.

1:04:14.652 --> 1:04:16.289
- You honestly know?

1:04:20.394 --> 1:04:24.396
What I know is in constant flux.

1:04:32.736 --> 1:04:36.573
- Where exactly did you find me?

1:04:36.608 --> 1:04:39.048
- It's not far.

1:04:39.083 --> 1:04:41.479
What were you doing
when you put it down?

1:04:41.514 --> 1:04:45.912
- Well you know, walking around.

1:04:45.947 --> 1:04:49.916
Hoping to trip and fall, crack
my skull, dislocate my knee.

1:04:49.951 --> 1:04:52.490
Carried away by
a stranger in the woods.

1:04:55.594 --> 1:04:57.561
Are you sure it wasn't here?

1:04:57.596 --> 1:04:59.761
- Yeah.

1:04:59.796 --> 1:05:02.973
Why?
- I found it!

1:05:05.274 --> 1:05:09.738
- God dammit!
- Do you have food in there?

1:05:09.773 --> 1:05:11.872
- Yeah. Everything's gone.

1:05:15.548 --> 1:05:17.548
This is impossible.

1:05:21.323 --> 1:05:23.785
It was my grandfather's.
He had it during the war.

1:05:27.626 --> 1:05:29.692
He's buried with this.

1:05:29.727 --> 1:05:32.266
- He surprised you.
- No. No. I took this piece

1:05:32.301 --> 1:05:34.961
and I placed it
in his coffin myself.

1:05:34.996 --> 1:05:37.370
This can't be here right
now, this is with him!

1:05:37.405 --> 1:05:42.540
- Things, they appear
here all the time.

1:05:42.575 --> 1:05:44.146
Did you think I wandered into
the forest with a truckload

1:05:44.181 --> 1:05:47.215
full of supplies?

1:05:47.250 --> 1:05:50.218
All those books in the trailer,
and the trailer itself.

1:05:50.253 --> 1:05:53.056
My family, we used to...

1:05:53.091 --> 1:05:55.949

one. And you've seen me, I don't

1:05:55.984 --> 1:05:59.458
know I don't know what I'm doing
out here. I...I...I don't even

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:05.563
Right?

1:06:11.439 --> 1:06:12.933
A triple cheeseburger.

1:06:16.037 --> 1:06:17.773
- And the girl?

1:06:19.447 --> 1:06:22.382
- It's my daughter.

1:06:22.417 --> 1:06:27.750
It's all memories. She loved
stories and rabbits and she was

1:06:27.785 --> 1:06:30.687
always...fascinated by fire.

1:06:33.428 --> 1:06:37.067

to rest a minute.

five more hours.
