Good afternoon.

I saw it too.

not yet been recovered,

some of the thieves have,
or at least parts of them.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.360
Yes, parts.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.170
It is believed that
a man-eating shark

01:38.170 --> 01:41.350
has been roaming these waters
and may have attacked the group

But is it?

02:37.870 --> 02:41.110
We have received several reports
of a shark prowling the shores,

02:41.110 --> 02:43.480
and while this isn't
uncommon, these reports

02:43.480 --> 02:46.600
claim that the shark is
in fact monstrous, ranging

02:46.600 --> 02:49.570
from 50 to 60 feet
in length, larger

02:49.570 --> 02:51.070
than any known great white.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.810
Does the sudden
appearance have anything

02:52.810 --> 02:55.450
to do with the increased
drilling at the newly renovated

02:55.450 --> 02:56.980

to a local marina,

07:58.230 --> 08:00.570

to shuttle the stolen
goods across the channel

the ocean tides can build up,

deeper than 20 feet,

OK, step on it then.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.475
Hey, anyone here know
how to drive a boat?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.970
We'll worry about that
when we get there.

16:44.450 --> 16:46.190
This isn't a yacht.

16:46.190 --> 16:49.700
You two must be here for
the Top Model Tomorrow show.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.210
Which one of you is the model?

16:53.210 --> 16:55.850
She is, of course.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.850
Yeah, I was joking.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.600
Look, I'm sorry about the boat,
but that's all the station

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
was going to spring for.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.770
But don't worry.

We'll make it work.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.800
I'm Stan.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.880
This is Bree, your model,
and I'm Destiny, her manager.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.720
You don't plan on bringing all
that crap on board, do you?

17:14.720 --> 17:16.520
I need it for the shoot.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.960
Well, you can leave
it on the dock

17:17.960 --> 17:21.185
and we can come back and
pick it up if you need it.

17:21.185 --> 17:23.240
What if someone steals it?

17:23.240 --> 17:24.740
We can only be so lucky.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.630
It was another joke.

17:29.630 --> 17:32.510
You don't have much of a
sense of humor, do you, lady?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.880
Maybe your jokes just
aren't that funny.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.623
Fair enough.

17:35.623 --> 17:37.040
OK, here's what
we're going to do.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.873
We're going to shoot
some stuff on the boat,

17:38.873 --> 17:40.640
then we're going
to transmit live,

17:40.640 --> 17:42.410
then we're going to take
the boat out into the ocean

17:42.410 --> 17:43.745
and do some more B-roll footage.

17:46.470 --> 17:46.970

17:46.970 --> 17:48.770
What's wrong now?

Don't tell me you're
afraid of the water too.

17:52.130 --> 17:53.870
Well, she's just worried about--

17:53.870 --> 17:56.570
It's just all those stories
that your channel reports

17:56.570 --> 17:58.370
about the monster shark.

17:58.370 --> 18:00.500
Is it all true?

18:00.500 --> 18:01.820
Oh, yeah.

18:01.820 --> 18:08.450
As a matter of fact, it could be
lurking underwater right here!

18:08.450 --> 18:10.550
That was another joke, right?

We're going to be

directly into the camera lens

19:40.760 --> 19:46.580

the studio personnel ask you.

20:18.270 --> 20:20.940

20:20.940 --> 20:24.540
Bree, tell us why you want to
be in the modeling profession.

20:29.210 --> 20:33.000
Say something, dammit.

20:33.000 --> 20:33.855
We're live now?

20:33.855 --> 20:34.355
Yes.

20:38.650 --> 20:43.270
Well, it's wonderful to be on
your show and I'm so excited.

20:43.270 --> 20:45.200
What was the question again?

20:45.200 --> 20:48.250
Bree, why do you want
to be a top model?

20:48.250 --> 20:49.720
Oh, that's easy.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.610
For starters, I'm
very attractive.

20:51.610 --> 20:52.840
Anyone would agree with that.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.330
Plus my boyfriend thinks that
I should choose a profession

20:55.330 --> 20:56.770
where I keep my clothes on.

Did you know a
female's shelf life

20:58.507 --> 20:59.965

only three years?

21:02.830 --> 21:05.320
That's interesting, Bree.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.740
Tell us about your manager.

21:07.740 --> 21:09.580
Destiny?

21:09.580 --> 21:10.333
She's amazing.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.500
She's like my second mother.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.220
She takes such good care of me.

21:13.220 --> 21:15.880
I mean, she only does
take 60% of my earnings.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.590
I mean, that's so
generous of her.

21:33.620 --> 21:38.000

on world peace?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.340
I think everyone should get
a piece once in a while.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.035
No, no, no, not
that peace, Bree.

21:44.980 --> 21:47.065
Peace, getting along.

Ah, yes.

21:48.040 --> 21:48.820

World peace is important so that
way the world can be peaceful.

that was recently destroyed

24:04.970 --> 24:07.400
last week by unknown causes.

24:07.400 --> 24:11.360
Then we have reports of a
mysterious, monstrous shark

24:11.360 --> 24:13.340
prowling the waters.

24:13.340 --> 24:16.280
Could the two
somehow be related?

Calls to the headquarters to
the firm that owned and operated

24:20.030 --> 24:22.160
the rig have gone unanswered.

However, we have a guest
in the studio today

24:24.980 --> 24:29.030

on our shark mystery.

your run-in with the shark?

Well, I don't know
anything about that oil rig

24:40.430 --> 24:43.400
other than that it blocked
the view of the ocean we once

24:43.400 --> 24:46.580
had from the marina I managed.

bit them off in one fell swoop!

bleed to death.

wasn't anything known to man.

all their drilling,

30:18.598 --> 30:20.390
You made us leave all
our bags at the dock,

30:20.390 --> 30:22.340
and our phones were in there.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.180
Fucking great.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.050
[SPLASH]

30:37.060 --> 30:37.720
There.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.210
At least we won't drift
away from the painting.

30:40.210 --> 30:41.710
What are we going to do?

30:41.710 --> 30:43.690
Give me a second to think.

30:43.690 --> 30:46.300
Remember, in 10 seconds
you ruined all our plans.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.355
What are you thinking?

30:56.355 --> 30:56.855
Nothing.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.950
Nothing at all.

31:02.950 --> 31:03.450
Good.

31:03.450 --> 31:04.350
Keep it that way.

31:08.820 --> 31:11.430
Tell us again about
your frightening escape

31:11.430 --> 31:14.400
from the doomed oil rig.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.680
My buddy and I had been
on the rig for months.

31:17.680 --> 31:21.660
I think they dug too deep
and discovered something.

31:21.660 --> 31:24.460
That's where I saw a large
prehistoric shark destroy

31:24.460 --> 31:26.100
our rig.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.140
No one stood a chance.

31:28.140 --> 31:31.080
What makes you believe
it was prehistoric?

31:31.080 --> 31:33.790
The secret operatives said so.

31:33.790 --> 31:35.670
They knew what it was.

31:35.670 --> 31:37.560
Tell us about the operatives.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.850
Who were they?

31:38.850 --> 31:42.630
They worked for the oil
company doing the drilling.

31:42.630 --> 31:46.500
We think they were sent here
to clean up all the witnesses.

31:46.500 --> 31:51.060
Another survivor and I
made it to Smash Up Island.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.070
There they captured
us and intended

31:53.070 --> 31:56.850
on killing us to silence
us so that we wouldn't

31:56.850 --> 31:59.670
say what we saw or knew.

31:59.670 --> 32:01.635
The shark got them,
though, and we escaped.

32:13.860 --> 32:15.330
Where the hell did his feed go?

32:28.980 --> 32:29.820
Where is he?

32:42.540 --> 32:44.160
Boyd, see if you
can hotwire this

32:44.160 --> 32:46.030
while I keep an eye
on the painting.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.720
I don't know anything
about hot wiring a boat!

32:48.720 --> 32:50.100
I do.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.380
You want this idiot
to fry the engine out?

32:52.380 --> 32:54.705
Hey, hey, watch for your
calling an idiot, all right?

32:59.670 --> 33:02.670
Hey, you two, how long are
you supposed to be out here?

33:02.670 --> 33:03.480
Till this evening.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.065
Why?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.940
Just trying to figure
out how much time we've

33:05.940 --> 33:08.410
got before somebody
comes looking for us.

33:08.410 --> 33:11.050
We still have to
get our painting.

33:11.050 --> 33:12.890
I know.

33:12.890 --> 33:13.990
Whoa!

33:13.990 --> 33:16.900
What the hell?

33:16.900 --> 33:17.890
Out there!

33:17.890 --> 33:19.256
The shark!

33:19.256 --> 33:20.654
[GUNSHOTS]

33:23.920 --> 33:24.740
It's coming for us!

33:24.740 --> 33:25.240

33:28.140 --> 33:29.628
[GROWLS]

33:35.580 --> 33:37.152
Jesus, that was close.

33:37.152 --> 33:38.610
Did you see the
size of that thing?

33:38.610 --> 33:40.230
That wasn't no normal shark!

33:40.230 --> 33:42.480
What's important is that
it will be back for us!

33:42.480 --> 33:45.380
That thing has a vendetta
against us for some reason!

33:45.380 --> 33:46.940
Gerald, get back to hotwiring.

33:46.940 --> 33:49.400
And you, stop crying up there!

33:49.400 --> 33:51.400
We're safe enough!

33:51.400 --> 33:53.150
Until it capsizes us.

33:53.150 --> 33:54.770
Maybe so.

33:54.770 --> 33:56.810
Just hope you could swim faster.

33:56.810 --> 33:58.340
We're running out of time!

33:58.340 --> 34:00.170
And options.

34:00.170 --> 34:02.420
If I want anything
out of you, I'd ask.

34:02.420 --> 34:03.810
Get back to work.

34:03.810 --> 34:07.830
Maybe the Coast Guard will come
by soon and we'll be rescued.

34:07.830 --> 34:10.210
That's just what
they don't want.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.300
That's the smartest thing
you've said all day!

34:12.300 --> 34:13.770
Pipe down!

34:13.770 --> 34:15.878
I don't see it anywhere.

34:15.878 --> 34:16.920
It's out there somewhere.

34:16.920 --> 34:17.879
Keep your eyes peeled.

34:27.380 --> 34:30.620
Our investigative team
discovered crucial information

34:30.620 --> 34:32.750
in regards to the
oil rig disaster

34:32.750 --> 34:34.440
earlier this afternoon.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.070
It appears a large
bore S7 drill was

34:37.070 --> 34:40.639
used to puncture the bedrock
beneath the rig to drill deeper

34:40.639 --> 34:42.409
than anyone has before.

34:42.409 --> 34:45.860
Drilling regulations permit
only a size S2 drill.

34:45.860 --> 34:48.710
Could the illegal size drill
have fractured the foundation,

34:48.710 --> 34:50.719
causing the rig to collapse?

34:50.719 --> 34:52.790
Could the drill have
hit an ice pocket

34:52.790 --> 34:57.560
and released a sea demon
frozen in time into our oceans?

34:57.560 --> 35:01.610
An initial investigation by
authorities provides no clues.

35:01.610 --> 35:04.100
Another question
that goes unanswered

35:04.100 --> 35:06.950
is where did all the bodies go?

35:06.950 --> 35:09.860
Records show that 78
people worked on the rig

35:09.860 --> 35:11.390
on a daily basis.

35:11.390 --> 35:15.120
To this day, not one
body has been recovered.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.160
Did the tide wash
them out to sea,

35:17.160 --> 35:19.670
are they still trapped
in the wreckage,

35:19.670 --> 35:23.510
or did the so-called sea
monster devour them like flies

35:23.510 --> 35:25.530
as they fell into the water?

35:25.530 --> 35:27.890
These questions and
more will hopefully

35:27.890 --> 35:29.675
be answered in
the next few days.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.510
Well?

35:38.510 --> 35:40.400
This is impossible.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.537
Can't be repaired.

35:41.537 --> 35:43.120
I'm not sure if the
engine would start

35:43.120 --> 35:44.720
even if I could repair it.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.850
I told you he wouldn't
be able to get it going.

35:46.850 --> 35:49.850
This is coming from the asshole
who put us in this situation.

35:49.850 --> 35:51.942
Wait, let's just worry
about the painting.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.900
Maybe we have to paddle
this stinking thing out

35:53.900 --> 35:55.400
to Cat Island!

35:55.400 --> 35:57.680
Well, how can we recover it?

35:57.680 --> 35:59.900
One of us is going to dive in.

35:59.900 --> 36:01.468
Simple enough.

36:01.468 --> 36:02.510
Are you out of your mind?

36:02.510 --> 36:04.580
We won't last a minute
down there with that shark!

36:04.580 --> 36:05.480
The hell with the painting!

36:05.480 --> 36:06.710
Let's worry about our lives!

36:06.710 --> 36:08.390

36:08.390 --> 36:09.440

36:12.020 --> 36:13.100
You go, Boyd.

36:13.100 --> 36:15.470

36:23.360 --> 36:25.550
He'll die if you
send him down there.

36:25.550 --> 36:29.270
Maybe you'd like to
take his place then.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.800
Sharks are attracted to sound.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.200
What's that, Miss America?

36:33.200 --> 36:34.550
Sharks are attracted to sound.

36:34.550 --> 36:36.863
If we splash the water,
hit the side of the boat,

36:36.863 --> 36:38.780
hopefully it'll distract
the shark long enough

36:38.780 --> 36:40.550
for him to get down and back.

36:40.550 --> 36:42.425
No, I don't like the idea much.

36:51.780 --> 36:53.400
Look, it's directly below us.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.680
You dive down, grab
it, pull it up.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.730
It's only 18 feet
to the bottom here.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.070
You can do it.

36:59.070 --> 37:00.090
You think so, Clark?

37:00.090 --> 37:01.410
Yeah, just take a deep breath.

Good, Gerald.

37:10.710 --> 37:11.210
Good.

All right, let's start
hitting the boat.

And don't worry.

Once we're overdue
to return, they'll

39:20.250 --> 39:22.030
send a search party out for us.

We should be easy to spot.

from where they even search.

39:28.890 --> 39:31.080
Well, we can't give up hope.

search for us and find us.

short attention span

the interests of my fuhrer.

So the Nazi mad scientist, and
you've kept Hitler's brain.

the reign of my fuhrer.

transplanted into someone.

wise to doubt me.

some obedience lessons.

will continue.

fiddling with here?

I'm making fine
adjustments to my stun gun

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.940
so next time we meet the
shark, it will not escape.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.530
I will stun it with this and you
and I will bring it back here

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:49.170
for modifications and
further experimenting.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.950
Probably an answer I don't
want, but what about me?

You will be safe as
long as you help me.

finding this Sharkenstein?

It will find us.

exactly have this in mind.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.590
It has marked you.

Once it gets your
scent, it will be here.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.040
Then I will jump
out and stun it.

your time with that.

it get my scent?
