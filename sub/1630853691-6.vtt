WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.120
You guys are gorgeous.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.679
What do you want from me?
-Absolutely nothing.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.640
Jealous that Reut is better-looking
and more successful than you?

00:12.679 --> 00:15.720
I feel sorry that a handsome,
good-hearted man like him

00:16.000 --> 00:17.679
is going to end up
with a girl like you.

00:18.039 --> 00:20.679
I understand that you want me
and are beside yourself.

00:31.719 --> 00:35.240
Can you help me join... Tinder?
-Tinder?

00:35.359 --> 00:37.320
Now what happens...

00:37.479 --> 00:39.320
Yeah?
-If I want someone,

00:39.359 --> 00:40.439
but he wants me too?

00:40.679 --> 00:44.159
A messenger will show up
at your door... -You asshole.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.079
From Tinder International.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.280
Try thinking about
where he proposed to you.

00:48.359 --> 00:50.679
Is there something
you never told him?

00:51.679 --> 00:55.159
Enough, Tomer,
I don't like these exercises.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.079
I think that I'm

00:57.200 --> 00:59.159
still totally in love with my ex.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.280
Then why did you want
to go on this date?

01:01.359 --> 01:03.280
Because I wanted
to kiss someone.

01:12.079 --> 01:13.000
Sarel!

01:13.959 --> 01:16.319
She's not answering...
-What?!

01:16.680 --> 01:19.079
Maya's not answering,
Tali drove over to her house.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.079
I heard you
the first time.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.120
Where the hell is she?

01:22.200 --> 01:23.599
Do you realize
the Culture Minister is here?

01:23.680 --> 01:25.079
The Minister wants to talk to you,

01:25.159 --> 01:26.640
she's on her way backstage.

01:26.959 --> 01:30.319
God help me.
Run and tidy my office. Run!

01:30.400 --> 01:33.079
You.
You fill in for Maya.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.000
What?
-Fill in for Maya Gutman!

01:35.079 --> 01:38.159
I don't know her part.
-You've done this lousy play 300 times,

01:38.239 --> 01:39.280
didn't you get any of it?

01:39.359 --> 01:40.560
No, I know some of it.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.319
The rest Sarel
will tell you in your earphone.

01:42.439 --> 01:45.280
Now go...
-But Vera, who will do my part?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.280
What?
-Who will play the dog?

01:47.319 --> 01:50.280
Nobody even knows
there's a dog in this play!

01:50.319 --> 01:52.480
Don't stand there
like a halfwit!

01:52.519 --> 01:53.319
What?

01:53.400 --> 01:56.079
Take your stupid friends
that I pay

01:56.280 --> 01:58.400
and get Maya Gutman here!

01:58.480 --> 02:00.280
Whoever stands around today
without moving

02:00.560 --> 02:02.599
won't get paid this month!

02:03.000 --> 02:08.599
Oh, our honored guests,
how are you? -Fine.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.960
Is something wrong?

02:11.039 --> 02:12.280
A small technical problem.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.080
I apologize,
come with me.

02:15.159 --> 02:17.680
What can we do?
That's life in the theater.

02:18.000 --> 02:18.960
It's like a circus

02:19.199 --> 02:20.280
or the parliament,

02:20.360 --> 02:23.319
anything can happen.
-Don't worry about it.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.439
I truly apologize,
I'll cut off someone's head.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.159
Check the ceviche, Buddha.
-Okay.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.599
What is that?
Is that fish?

02:36.680 --> 02:38.159
Yeah, taste it, Dad.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.000
The sea-bream fillet
is in miso, Buddha.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.479
What's sea-bream?
It's a fish?

02:42.599 --> 02:44.120
Taste it, Dad,
it's in sauce.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.680
Is this miso?
Is this the miso?

02:46.960 --> 02:48.639
Yes, Zvika, it's miso sauce.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.680
Miso, miso, I heard you, miso.

02:52.479 --> 02:55.680
Buddha, we said no phones.
-You're right. Okay.

03:33.199 --> 03:34.560
Excuse me.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.280
Dear audience,
we apologize,

03:37.360 --> 03:39.479
the play will begin shortly.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.599
I'll have to sit like this
for two hours?

03:43.680 --> 03:45.639
How long is the play?
-I don't know.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.479
Probably an hour and a half.

03:47.599 --> 03:50.240
Why don't they start already?

03:50.479 --> 03:53.280
Because of the minister?
-What minister?

03:53.360 --> 03:55.560
The Culture Minister
is here to see the play.

03:55.639 --> 03:56.599
What for?

03:57.479 --> 04:00.479
I don't know,
I guess she likes theater.

04:00.599 --> 04:03.080
No one likes theater.
-She does.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.080
Everybody comes here to sleep.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.480
So, how was your date
with that guy from Tinder?

04:20.240 --> 04:21.079
Okay.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.000
Nice. Sweet.

04:24.439 --> 04:25.480
It wasn't it.

04:26.079 --> 04:27.160
We kissed.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.319
What do you mean,
"nice, sweet, it wasn't it, we kissed"?

04:34.360 --> 04:35.959
Why did you kiss him?

04:36.120 --> 04:37.680
I don't know why.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.720
You don't know why?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.439
How can you not know why?

04:42.519 --> 04:44.160
Excuse me, are we married?

04:44.279 --> 04:45.680
I wanted to kiss him,
so I kissed him.

04:45.959 --> 04:46.639
I like kissing.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.120
Fine, fine, fine.
-Fine.

04:48.399 --> 04:50.160
"I like kissing..."

04:50.680 --> 04:53.680
Kiss the old guy sitting next to you,
he likes kissing too.

04:53.959 --> 04:54.680
I already kissed him,

04:54.720 --> 04:57.480
that's why there's
tension between us. -Nice.

04:57.519 --> 04:59.399
We kissed just before.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.480
See the usher over there?

05:02.519 --> 05:04.319
Which one?
-That guy.

05:04.399 --> 05:06.600
Go kiss him. -I asked him
before if he wanted to,

05:06.680 --> 05:08.079
but he's like...

05:08.199 --> 05:10.079
afraid of intimacy.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.319
We didn't go for it.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.480
Listen, if the play is crappy,
I'm gonna tell them that it's great.

05:21.639 --> 05:22.680
So...

05:22.720 --> 05:24.160
don't give me away.

05:25.079 --> 05:27.680
Understand why I never
go to my friends' plays?

05:28.079 --> 05:31.319
Everyone gets offended anyway.
-Yeah, that's why you don't go.

05:33.279 --> 05:35.480
Then why did you come now?

05:41.720 --> 05:43.160
What did you ask?

05:44.079 --> 05:45.680
Why did you come now?

05:48.639 --> 05:50.120
What?

06:08.279 --> 06:11.240
Dear audience,
we apologize for the delay,

06:11.519 --> 06:13.720
the play will begin shortly.

06:20.959 --> 06:22.480
Let's go see
what's delaying them.

06:22.639 --> 06:24.319
Let's just go.
-Come on.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.439
-Home.
-Excuse me.

06:31.560 --> 06:35.319
Please come in.
-Wow, what a cultural room.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.319
I'm leaving you here
with Karina, my secretary...

06:37.519 --> 06:40.480
I mean, head of
our artistic department.

06:40.519 --> 06:43.480
She knows everything,
reads everything, you name it.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.240
She'll give you a full update.

06:46.279 --> 06:48.639
Okay, thank you.
-Karina.

06:58.439 --> 07:00.000
So...

07:00.519 --> 07:05.319
we have a very interesting repertoire
this year.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.720
Hanoch Levin, Nissim Aloni,

07:13.720 --> 07:16.160
Chekhov.
-Please, before you continue,

07:16.279 --> 07:19.600
get me a cup of tea.
Moti, don't overdo it with the wine.

07:49.079 --> 07:52.439
Just tell me if it was cool,
so I know

07:52.480 --> 07:54.279
that it's okay...
Is it okay?

07:54.480 --> 07:57.279
It's okay.
Vera, why aren't we starting?

07:57.319 --> 07:59.000
You! Dog!

07:59.600 --> 08:02.480
Why? -You play the dog
instead of Elinor.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.480
Elinor will do Maya's part.
Sarel!

08:04.560 --> 08:06.079
At least we have a dog.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.639
It's easy, no text,
just bark.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.680
No, Vera,

08:08.959 --> 08:10.720
I'm not playing a dog.
-What did you say?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.600
I don't do stuff like that...

08:12.680 --> 08:13.480
You listen to me!

08:13.519 --> 08:15.680
When you're in this theater,
you'll play a dog,

08:15.959 --> 08:18.480
an elephant,
you'll even play a cabbage

08:18.519 --> 08:19.600
if I tell you to.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.079
You, come here.
Go talk to the Minister

08:23.160 --> 08:24.600
about this, that and the other.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.319
You're a woman
and you're a writer

08:26.360 --> 08:28.000
and you're original
and you're young.

08:28.199 --> 08:30.079
I don't do these kinds of parts.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.319
The audience doesn't mind.

08:31.439 --> 08:34.679
If you open up their hearts,
they don't mind if it's with a big key

08:34.960 --> 08:36.320
or a small key.

08:39.080 --> 08:43.080
It's a great honor for me to meet you.
-For me too.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.480
Vera says
you're a very promising playwright.

08:47.519 --> 08:48.480
What time do you have?

08:49.399 --> 08:51.159
I hope I'll live up to it.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.639
It's five to nine.

08:55.679 --> 08:57.320
Moti, we'll be leaving soon.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.440
I understand that you increased
funding for theaters.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.279
Oh no. Shit.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.480
What's wrong?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.480
I have a run in my nylons.
-Oh no.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.960
So what is your play about?

09:12.039 --> 09:16.480
It's a play about relationships.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.159
It's like a comedy,
situations from...

09:20.279 --> 09:23.320
Minister, I have nail polish.
-Nail polish?

09:23.360 --> 09:25.480
Your generation
still uses that trick?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.080
No one's come up
with anything better.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.120
Yes, and we still use
paper ballots to vote. -That's true. I...

09:32.039 --> 09:33.159
May I?

09:33.639 --> 09:34.639
Moti...

09:35.440 --> 09:36.399
Don't look.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.159
Nir, what do I have a bodyguard for?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.679
Do me a favor,
stand outside the door.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.159
Yes, so the play,
what's it about?

09:46.240 --> 09:47.279
It's a comedy

09:48.159 --> 09:50.320
based on
my relationship with my ex

09:50.399 --> 09:51.679
and he's directing it.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.000
When did you break up?

09:54.240 --> 09:56.159
Right when we started
working on the play.

09:56.279 --> 09:58.279
And how do you...
work together?

10:00.480 --> 10:02.480
What can I tell you?
It's...

10:03.480 --> 10:04.600
complicated.

10:04.679 --> 10:06.960
Complicated?
It's awful.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.320
Me and my ex were in the same administration;
that was complicated.

10:11.399 --> 10:16.279
We fought non-stop.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.440
I objected to every
bill he submitted

10:18.559 --> 10:21.080
and made sure the whole party
would object.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.000
To this day there's no access
for the disabled at Masada

10:24.080 --> 10:25.559
and that's a shame.
-A crying shame.

10:25.639 --> 10:28.320
But what could I do?
He drove me nuts.

10:28.399 --> 10:31.600
Of course. It's awful.
-Nightmare.

10:31.679 --> 10:33.159
Did you resign in the end?

10:33.279 --> 10:35.000
Me? Resign?

10:35.080 --> 10:36.279
Let him resign! No way.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.960
Wait a second, Minister.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.600
Please, don't call me 'Minister'.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.639
it's too formal.

10:41.679 --> 10:43.480
Then what am
I supposed to say? Shulamit?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.320
Yes, that's my name.
Nice to meet you.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.320
Nice to meet you.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.639
So tell me, Shulamit,

10:50.399 --> 10:53.000
after you and your ex divorced,
when...

10:54.240 --> 10:56.720
how long did it take
until you felt...

10:57.200 --> 11:00.120
you could be with another man?
-Men?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.080
I believe in terms.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.440
Four years.

11:03.519 --> 11:06.000
Every four years, you need a change,
in relationships too.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.279
I realized that after my divorce.
-Then when did you and Moti meet?

11:09.320 --> 11:11.000
Moti is new.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.159
Two months.

11:12.279 --> 11:13.320
My new boyfriend.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.320
Really?
-Yes, it's refreshing,

11:15.639 --> 11:17.279
I don't have time
to take things to heart.

11:18.279 --> 11:21.000
But what is it worth
if you don't take things to heart?

11:21.320 --> 11:22.480
Minister.
-Yes.

11:22.519 --> 11:23.960
Shooting attack near Hebron.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.080
I knew it, I just knew it.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.639
Let me know if they're
holding a cabinet meeting.

11:29.679 --> 11:32.159
Then I won't have to see
the play or anything.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.279
Moti, shall we go?

11:33.480 --> 11:37.120
Vera, the audience is complaining,
people want to leave.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.480
They can go to hell.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.480
Shlomik, my heart can't take this,

11:43.519 --> 11:45.600
go to my office
and talk to the Culture Minister.

11:45.679 --> 11:48.559
Vera, give me a break.
-She loves you,

11:48.639 --> 11:50.320
Says you're
an unalienable asset and shit...

11:50.360 --> 11:52.240
I hate that!

11:52.679 --> 11:54.679
Stop sending me
to talk to everyone.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.639
She'll promise me
another Lifetime Achievement Award!

11:57.080 --> 11:59.120
Same shit every year.
-What should I do?

11:59.320 --> 12:01.000
Cancel the performance.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.480
Can I tell you something?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.320
There will be a show
and everything will be okay,

12:05.600 --> 12:09.320
listen to someone who's
been here for 60 years.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.480
At the end of the day,
the theater's magic

12:13.080 --> 12:14.159
always comes through!

12:15.440 --> 12:18.480
God help me.
Why do I deserve this?

12:18.559 --> 12:20.279
Just tell her the truth.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.080
Fuck off, Shlomo.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.600
The truth isn't an option.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.279
I like the coleslaw.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.120
No coleslaw,
it's so eighties.

12:32.039 --> 12:33.080
No?
-No.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.399
Then no.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.600
It's okay,
I don't need coleslaw.

12:37.559 --> 12:40.000
It's way too much
for me anyway.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.279
Can I have it?

12:43.240 --> 12:44.639
Maya, I don't know
if Reut told you,

12:44.679 --> 12:47.399
but in our town

12:47.480 --> 12:49.080
we do pot-luck weddings.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.399
Instead of a check.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.159
And it's lovely.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.559
Mom, we're not having
that kind of wedding.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.440
No, I'm just saying.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.000
If everyone brings something

12:59.080 --> 13:02.080
you can serve it on big trays
and tables...

13:02.120 --> 13:04.559
We're not going to have a wedding
with homemade food, okay?

13:04.679 --> 13:05.600
Mom, enough.

13:06.279 --> 13:07.320
No is no...

13:08.240 --> 13:11.480
as long as Reut is happy.
-He's happy.

13:17.279 --> 13:18.559
Cheers.
-Cheers, Dad.

13:20.039 --> 13:21.320
Cheers, Buddha.
-Cheers, gorgeous.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.480
I'm sorry, Maya,
I know we said no phones,

13:23.559 --> 13:26.080
I'll just take a look
to see if the hospital called,

13:26.159 --> 13:29.320
maybe your foot brace
is ready, Zvika.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.399
I walk fine without it!
Foot brace...

13:32.519 --> 13:34.679
She's doing it on purpose.
-You're overreacting.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
She's doing it on purpose.
-Breathe.

13:36.279 --> 13:40.279
Will she take her phone out
during the wedding, too? -Breathe.

13:43.279 --> 13:45.000
Maya, it's from your theater.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.480
What?
-Wait, it's a recording.

13:49.159 --> 13:50.480
How should I know
who was looking for me?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.159
What extension should I push?
-Shit! Shit!

13:53.279 --> 13:54.720
What's wrong, Buddha?
-No, no, no.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.320
What is it?
-I'm dead.

13:56.519 --> 13:57.480
You have a show?

13:57.679 --> 14:00.279
Is tapioca the same as tempura, Reut?
-Sarel?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.320
I'm on my way.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.600
What Culture Minister?
-What?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.960
It's today?
-What happened with the Culture Minister?

14:07.039 --> 14:07.960
I'm on my way.

14:08.039 --> 14:09.480
Just tell them
I'm on my way!

14:11.080 --> 14:13.240
I didn't write it down,
how is that possible?

14:13.279 --> 14:14.720
She's the one who said
no phones.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.720
I wanted to focus on our relationship!

14:17.000 --> 14:18.679
Buddha!
-I wanted to focus on our relationship!

14:18.720 --> 14:20.679
How much time do you have?
-No, no, no.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.000
How much time do you have?

14:22.080 --> 14:24.000
Yuvi will take you
on his motorcycle. -What?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.559
Yuvi has a motorcycle,
he lives nearby.

14:26.559 --> 14:27.480
Yuvi who?

14:27.559 --> 14:29.279
This way you won't
get stuck in traffic.

14:29.320 --> 14:33.120
Maya, breathe deep, deep,
like the sea.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.080
Listen, man, where are you?

14:35.159 --> 14:36.480
Oh, this is tempura!

14:41.480 --> 14:43.399
Thanks so much, man.

14:44.679 --> 14:46.320
You said it was an emergency.

14:46.399 --> 14:48.080
Get on, princess.

14:48.279 --> 14:49.480
The helmet should fit you.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.279
Thanks, brother.
-No problem.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.480
Let me do it, Buddha.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.440
Trust him,
he's the best driver in town.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.720
Have a safe trip.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.320
Bye.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.000
Hold him tight!

15:15.679 --> 15:17.320
Tali, if I decide to cancel,

15:17.399 --> 15:20.240
how much will it cost
to give everyone a refund?

15:20.279 --> 15:22.000
Give me a number!

15:22.080 --> 15:22.960
Vera.

15:23.039 --> 15:25.399
One moment. What?
-Vera, Vera,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.480
we found Maya,
she's on her way.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.279
Don't do anything!
No refunds!

15:29.440 --> 15:31.480
Where is she?
-Oh the way, on a motorcycle.

15:31.519 --> 15:33.399
How long will it take her?
-I don't know,

15:33.440 --> 15:35.320
But should I tell Elinor-
-Who cares about Elinor?

15:35.399 --> 15:36.679
Sarel, focus.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
What do I tell the Minister?

15:38.120 --> 15:40.080
Good question.
-Great, thanks.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.320
Hello.
-How are we doing?

15:43.480 --> 15:44.600
We're taking care
of the problem,

15:44.679 --> 15:47.000
it'll take a little while,
but it'll all work out.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.320
Meanwhile, I arranged
a tour of the theater for you.

15:51.519 --> 15:52.679
But first...

15:53.240 --> 15:57.600
I know there's someone
you'll be very happy to see.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.159
One moment.

16:00.639 --> 16:02.960
Shlomo, knock-knock.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.480
He was so happy to hear that you...

16:08.399 --> 16:11.279
Hello.
-Hello.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.399
Where's Shlomo?
-Shlomo isn't here,

16:13.559 --> 16:15.679
I think he went to makeup.

16:17.039 --> 16:19.679
How are you, Minister?
-Very good, thank you.

16:20.519 --> 16:23.080
Get dressed.
-Right, get dressed.

16:24.279 --> 16:26.279
Good luck tonight.
-Thank you.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.480
Hello, hello?

16:40.480 --> 16:42.440
Sorry for the interruption.

16:42.679 --> 16:47.000
It's a great honor for our theater
to have an artist of his calibre here.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.000
Paul Groshovsky,

16:49.639 --> 16:51.720
the greatest director in Europe.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.720
The Israeli Minister of Culture.

16:55.279 --> 16:57.559
The Israeli Minister of Culture.

16:57.639 --> 17:00.000
This is the Israeli Minister of Culture.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.599
And this is Tomer, a director.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.480
Paul is directing Chekhov here.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.960
So you're Tomer?

17:10.319 --> 17:11.319
Yes, nice to meet you.

17:12.279 --> 17:16.599
Yes, Tomer is directing
a new original Israeli comedy.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.319
I don't want to interrupt for too long.
He's a big director.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.079
The bigger they are,
the more you have to...

17:22.160 --> 17:25.000
Are you directing
the play about the couple?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.160
Yes, that's right.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.279
With your ex-girlfriend?

17:30.160 --> 17:31.440
Yes. That's right.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.119
Why aren't you two together?

17:34.480 --> 17:37.319
He's doing a play
with his ex-girlfriend.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.079
I don't understand.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.680
No, I want to understand.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.000
Why is a young couple
that's creating together,

17:45.079 --> 17:47.119
that has so much in common,

17:47.279 --> 17:50.440
why were you so quick to break up?

17:52.359 --> 17:54.440
No, we weren't so quick...

17:56.519 --> 17:58.279
No, we weren't so quick,

17:58.359 --> 18:00.559
Iris and I broke up
after many...

18:00.640 --> 18:02.680
No, no, no, simple answers.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.160
Okay, uh...

18:08.599 --> 18:10.319
I didn't feel, uh...

18:10.559 --> 18:12.559
Uh-buh-schmuh,
just answer her,

18:12.640 --> 18:14.480
it's not that complicated.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.119
Okay, I understand.
-Okay. -Thank you.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.319
Good luck to you all.
Shall we continue?

18:40.200 --> 18:44.160
I want to read something
from his play.

18:47.319 --> 18:49.119
But in what language?

18:50.640 --> 18:52.079
You in Hebrew

18:53.279 --> 18:54.480
and you in German.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.720
What are you doing?
-Stop it.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.000
What are you doing?
-Reading a book.

19:16.319 --> 19:17.319
What's with you?

19:18.359 --> 19:19.440
I'm bored.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.279
Isn't there
something you can do on your own?

19:23.319 --> 19:26.480
On my own?
I've been doing that since I was six.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.319
But you're annoying me.

19:29.599 --> 19:31.319
You think I like it?

19:31.400 --> 19:34.079
You think I don't realize
I'm bothering you?

19:34.119 --> 19:36.000
Then why are you?
-Because I'm bored!

19:36.279 --> 19:39.279
And there's only you here.
Tzutz, there's only you!

19:40.079 --> 19:42.279
Then go out,
do something outside.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.160
I wish I could go out, but I can't,

19:46.279 --> 19:48.319
I don't feel like going anywhere
that's not here

19:48.400 --> 19:51.160
and I don't feel like doing anything
that's not with you.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.480
It's awful!

19:53.119 --> 19:54.400
This is funny.

19:56.599 --> 19:59.559
No, it's genius.

20:00.079 --> 20:06.240
You can't tell if they're
brother and sister or lovers.

20:19.079 --> 20:21.480
-What did you say?

20:22.319 --> 20:28.559
I said that you said it's genius,
but that you're being over-dramatic.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.000
Why am I being over-dramatic?
-Because it's not genius,

20:32.400 --> 20:34.000
it's cute.

20:45.519 --> 20:52.640
Perhaps you'd like your boyfriend
to think that I'm an idiot?

20:53.279 --> 20:57.160
And you think you're so smart?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.160
Coward! Coward!

21:04.279 --> 21:08.319
Tell him to his face
what you said to me!

21:09.000 --> 21:12.599
That's exactly what's so genius!

21:13.039 --> 21:17.599
You don't know!
This is life, this is love!

21:32.480 --> 21:35.559
You know nothing about love!

21:47.319 --> 21:50.680
There's a man like you
at every port.

22:01.279 --> 22:04.720
Heli, I'm hiding in here
for the time being, okay?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.319
Let them look for me.
-Okay.

22:12.279 --> 22:13.400
What happened to you?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.680
Nothing happened to me.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.000
Oh, you're filling in for Elinor?

22:20.559 --> 22:21.720
So you're my dog today?

22:22.079 --> 22:24.480
Watch it, Shlomo,
I'm not your dog.

22:24.559 --> 22:26.319
I'm nobody's dog.
What is this...

22:27.200 --> 22:28.680
Let me hear you bark.
-Forget it.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.160
Just one bark, please.

22:30.279 --> 22:32.319
One bark, for me.
-Stop it.

22:32.359 --> 22:34.680
Why the dramatics?
-Knock it off.

22:35.279 --> 22:36.599
Let's piss him off.

22:37.559 --> 22:38.440
Just try.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.640
Cut it out, Shlomo!

22:40.680 --> 22:43.079
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

22:43.319 --> 22:45.319
Everyone can fuck off!

22:45.519 --> 22:48.960
The audience is a bunch of old fogies
from the suburbs, who cares?

22:49.559 --> 22:51.960
Oh, you're stressed

22:52.039 --> 22:53.559
because of the Minister?
-What?

22:53.640 --> 22:56.440
Why should I care?
-That's what this is about,

22:56.480 --> 22:57.599
you're a little stressed.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.160
Bark in her face.

22:59.279 --> 23:00.279
Walk up to her and go...

23:00.480 --> 23:01.319
Stop it!

23:01.440 --> 23:03.640
Shlomo, get out.
enough already!

23:03.680 --> 23:05.319
You're driving me nuts!

23:05.400 --> 23:08.279
You can see I'm bummed.
-Relax, relax.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.480
It's just a dog, big deal.
-No, no,

23:11.680 --> 23:12.480
'big deal',

23:12.599 --> 23:16.640
they're desperate to give you
a Lifetime Achievement Award, poor guy.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.960
You idiot,
you think I care about an award?

23:19.079 --> 23:20.279
You care very much.

23:20.319 --> 23:21.599
You think, I care?

23:22.359 --> 23:24.480
You're an ignoramus,
that's what you are.

23:24.519 --> 23:27.319
I haven't been paid
for a month.

23:27.519 --> 23:29.319
You think she cares?

23:29.720 --> 23:32.599
You know how much
veteran actors earn per play?

23:32.680 --> 23:34.319
Ezra takes the bus home,

23:34.599 --> 23:35.480
did you know that?

23:36.119 --> 23:39.079
No. But good thing
we're inalienable assets.

23:39.279 --> 23:41.160
Inalienable assets...

23:41.559 --> 23:43.319
Maybe if I had
some assets of my own,

23:43.400 --> 23:44.960
I wouldn't mind.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.680
Then go tell her.
-Of course I'll tell her.

23:47.079 --> 23:48.440
Yeah, right.
-Ofer, don't piss me off,

23:48.480 --> 23:50.079
we're not talking about me.
-Why not? -No.

23:50.119 --> 23:51.480
I don't have a problem
with what I earn here,

23:51.519 --> 23:53.559
but you do, so go.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
You go bark at her.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.599
As if you earn so much here...

24:04.440 --> 24:07.599
How much do you get per play?
How much?

24:08.480 --> 24:10.400
I don't remember...
-How much?

24:10.480 --> 24:12.079
My agent takes care of all that...

24:12.160 --> 24:14.480
How much do you get per play?
Roughly?

24:14.720 --> 24:17.480
About 900, 920 dollars.
-Dollars?

24:18.960 --> 24:20.279
Dollars, not shekels?
-Uh-huh.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.319
3,200 shekels,
that's what you make?

24:23.119 --> 24:24.000
Per play?

24:28.559 --> 24:31.119
Motherfucker!
Fuck you.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.680
Oh, there he is!

24:39.119 --> 24:43.319
Shlomo.
-Our dear Shlomo, yes.

24:43.640 --> 24:48.079
It's always such a pleasure to see you.
-You too.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.400
This man is truly...

24:51.279 --> 24:52.599
an unalienable asset.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
An unalienable asset.

24:55.079 --> 24:56.440
Throughout the years

24:56.480 --> 25:01.079
you've moved the hearts
of so many people in Israel.

25:01.119 --> 25:05.240
We cannot tell
the story of Israeli culture

25:05.400 --> 25:06.680
without you, Shlomo.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.680
It's not work,

25:09.079 --> 25:11.319
it's a calling.

25:11.359 --> 25:13.559
Totally. -More power
to you, Shlomo. -Thank you.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.559
I'm sorry,
I have to get ready.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.680
Of course.
-Thank you.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.480
I don't want to make
any promises, but...

25:22.640 --> 25:24.240
if it were up to me,

25:24.279 --> 25:26.119
the Lifetime Award
in the upcoming year?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.480
I'll go make myself some coffee.
-No, Sarel will make it for you.

25:35.519 --> 25:38.559
No, I'll make it the way I like it.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.640
This is all so wonderful...

25:45.079 --> 25:47.279
Are you trying to kill me?
What the hell is she writing, Sarel?

25:47.319 --> 25:49.160
She's typing.

25:49.279 --> 25:50.480
God damn it.

25:50.519 --> 25:52.599
Karinchu, I have a weak heart,
I have nothing more to show her.

25:53.039 --> 25:53.960
Oh my god.

25:54.039 --> 25:55.680
Maybe there was traffic
because of the attack?

25:56.640 --> 25:58.079
What attack?

25:58.240 --> 26:00.559
There was a shooting attack
near Hebron. -When?

26:01.200 --> 26:03.680
About half an hour ago.

26:04.319 --> 26:05.480
But there are no casualties.

26:09.079 --> 26:11.000
You disappeared.
-Yes.

26:11.519 --> 26:13.599
Could you make me a cup of coffee?
Black.

26:14.119 --> 26:16.480
A heaping teaspoon, thank you.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.440
I met your ex.
-Yeah?

26:20.519 --> 26:21.720
Lots of hair.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.480
Listen, a few months ago

26:25.599 --> 26:27.240
my ex gave me a call.

26:27.359 --> 26:29.480
The one who was in
parliament with you? -Yes.

26:29.599 --> 26:32.720
He asked me to visit him
in the hospital. So I did.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.000
It was awful.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.960
He's incontinent
and can barely eat,

26:40.119 --> 26:41.279
and so skinny.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.559
And he was such a hunk...

26:44.319 --> 26:46.000
A former secret service man,
handsome,

26:46.079 --> 26:48.240
women would fall at his feet.

26:49.079 --> 26:50.079
Anyway,

26:50.160 --> 26:53.160
I wheeled him out
into the hall

26:53.599 --> 26:56.720
where he tugs at my sleeve
and whispers in my ear:

26:57.519 --> 27:00.480
"Shulamit, do me a favor,
kick me down the stairs.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I can't take it anymore."

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
He was serious.
-What did you do? -What did I do?

27:07.079 --> 27:08.559
I took him back to his room.

27:09.279 --> 27:12.079
I could never kick that man

27:12.319 --> 27:13.480
down any stairs.

27:14.079 --> 27:17.160
I couldn't do it when I was 30,
and certainly not now.

27:19.599 --> 27:23.319
Should I spell it out?
-If you could, yes.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.319
Kick that man
out of your life now,

27:25.359 --> 27:27.279
or you'll be stuck
with him for life.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.319
Okay.
-Okay.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.480
I've been here long enough.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.319
I'll say they called me

27:37.039 --> 27:38.680
to a cabinet meeting
and we'll go home.

27:39.079 --> 27:40.319
What about the play?

27:40.599 --> 27:41.960
I don't give a rat's ass.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.160
It's not that I don't like plays,

27:44.279 --> 27:46.079
theater is okay, but...

27:46.319 --> 27:47.440
I prefer film.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.720
Film is...
You know,

27:49.160 --> 27:51.680
much more credible,
it captures life.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.480
I'll have my coffee at home.
Thanks.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.000
Vera.
-Listen...

27:58.440 --> 28:02.480
I didn't want to worry you,
you heard about the attack, right? -Yes.

28:02.599 --> 28:05.960
Our actress is stuck in traffic
because of the attack.

28:07.279 --> 28:09.079
Thank God everyone is okay.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.319
I didn't want to worry you,
I thought things would work out.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.279
What can you do,
an attack is an attack.

28:17.519 --> 28:20.079
Force majeure is...
force majeure...

28:20.119 --> 28:22.240
That's our life here, isn't it?
-Yes.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.079
Thanks.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.400
And what happened
was a mistake, okay?

28:31.119 --> 28:31.960
So...

28:32.039 --> 28:33.480
It won't happen again.
-Of course.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.640
Who'd go near you anyway?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.720
Well, it's always nice
to see you, despite everything.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.599
Thank you, you too.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.000
Although I don't see
where all the money went

28:57.079 --> 28:59.319
that I gave you last year
for renovations.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.559
We renovated.
-No, you didn't. -Yes, we did.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.680
I'd like to see exactly
where the money went.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.680
And one more thing
I don't understand,

29:06.960 --> 29:10.480
why was it so urgent to bring in
a foreign director?

29:10.599 --> 29:11.960
With that money...

29:12.319 --> 29:15.960
you could've hired
five of our own young directors

29:16.160 --> 29:17.559
and let them do the work.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.000
One more thing,
before I forget,

29:20.119 --> 29:23.160
next season I want more comedies.
-Okay.

29:23.440 --> 29:26.480
Not too long,
an hour, hour and a half tops.

29:26.559 --> 29:27.640
No intermission.
-Okay.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.960
Otherwise you'll lose your audience.
-Of course.

29:30.039 --> 29:31.000
Okay.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.160
Vera. -What?
-I'm ready.

29:37.279 --> 29:38.640
And I'm not afraid.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.480
Thank you for this opportunity.

29:40.519 --> 29:42.559
It won't be necessary,
sweetie, but thanks.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.279
Another time.

29:49.359 --> 29:50.599
Thank you.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.079
Good evening.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.000
It's a sad evening.

29:56.279 --> 30:01.079
But this is the complex reality here
in the State of Israel.

30:01.319 --> 30:05.160
I wish we had the privilege
of only enjoying culture,

30:05.559 --> 30:08.240
theater, dance, film,

30:08.720 --> 30:11.319
but unfortunately,

30:11.559 --> 30:13.480
those days have not yet come.

30:13.960 --> 30:17.000
On an evening like this...
-She's here! -I'm here!

30:17.119 --> 30:19.720
This is a clear reminder

30:20.119 --> 30:22.640
of the many threats surrounding us.

30:23.359 --> 30:26.160
We are a small country
besieged by enemies.

30:28.279 --> 30:30.160
During all my years in office...
-Pull my pants off.

30:30.279 --> 30:33.640
culture has always...

30:40.599 --> 30:42.559
Not funny.

31:43.079 --> 31:44.079
That's my bone.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.480
Take the costume off.
It's my part.

31:46.559 --> 31:48.319
It's my part and I'm playing it.

31:48.599 --> 31:50.440
Even if some people here
think this dog

31:50.480 --> 31:52.400
isn't important,
they don't understand anything.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.680
Oh, you're the...
-This dog is the heart of the play.

31:55.720 --> 31:56.559
It's all yours...

31:56.640 --> 31:59.680
You can't do anything
in life without a heart, right?

31:59.960 --> 32:01.680
Take it off, it's my part.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.400
It's all yours, here.
