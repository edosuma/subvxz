00:15.090 --> 00:16.570
I found it in the trash in the back.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.080
Isn't it cool?

00:18.360 --> 00:18.800
Dude,

00:18.800 --> 00:20.800
you gotta stop pulling stuff out of the trash.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.720
It's unnatural.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.800
You're unnatural!

00:22.800 --> 00:23.390
Besides,

00:23.390 --> 00:24.230
this is different.

00:24.230 --> 00:26.140
It's a treasure from the past.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.860
It is a pretty sweet plate.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.440
We should put some food on this baby!

00:30.750 --> 00:31.620
Agreed.

00:31.830 --> 00:32.650
You know what would look

00:32.650 --> 00:33.840
great on this plate?

00:34.100 --> 00:36.560
Chocolate cake!

00:37.050 --> 00:37.810
Yes!

00:38.150 --> 00:40.650
But how can we afford something
as good as chocolate cake?

00:40.750 --> 00:41.620
Don't worry, dude.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.390
I think I know where we can get one.

00:45.290 --> 00:46.200
Check it, dude.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
Cake mix.

00:47.230 --> 00:48.220
Add some water,

00:48.220 --> 00:49.560
slap it in the oven,

00:49.610 --> 00:52.390
pull that greasy pig out and BAM!

00:52.390 --> 00:53.930
you've got yourself a cake, baby.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.930
I can't wait to eat that greasy pig.

00:56.360 --> 00:56.750
Wait,

00:56.790 --> 00:57.900
how much does it cost?

00:58.640 --> 00:59.640
A buck fifty.

01:01.150 --> 01:03.320
I told you cake mix is too expensive.

01:05.420 --> 01:08.330
Do you know the bride or the groom?

01:09.800 --> 01:10.810
The one with the cake?

01:16.550 --> 01:18.230
We don't have cakes.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.270
Well,

01:28.400 --> 01:29.720
I'm all out of ideas.

01:30.130 --> 01:30.900
I got it!

01:30.900 --> 01:32.900
There's that chocolate
cake at the snack bar!

01:34.120 --> 01:36.550
But Benson will only let you
have it for free if it's your birthday.

01:36.550 --> 01:38.340
Who is to say it's not my birthday?

01:38.710 --> 01:40.370
Who is to say it's not MY birthday?

01:40.650 --> 01:42.850
Free cake! Free cake!

01:42.850 --> 01:44.740
It's neither of your birthdays.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.600
He's killing us with that!

01:47.710 --> 01:50.270
No cake. No cake.

01:50.390 --> 01:53.050
But it IS Skips' birthday!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.390
Free cake! Free cake!

01:55.390 --> 01:57.860
He's really private about it.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.680
No cake. No cake.

02:00.810 --> 02:01.700
Come to think of it,

02:01.730 --> 02:04.190
I don't think we've ever had a party for Skips.

02:04.470 --> 02:06.130
If memory serves,

02:06.440 --> 02:08.560
Skips secludes himself in the woods

02:08.560 --> 02:10.560
every year on the day of his birth.

02:11.020 --> 02:11.520
So, wait?

02:11.760 --> 02:13.960
You guys have never thrown a party for Skips?

02:14.080 --> 02:14.570
No.

02:14.570 --> 02:15.620
Dude, that sucks!

02:15.620 --> 02:18.250
-Skips totally deserves a party!
-And cake!

02:18.380 --> 02:19.660
Whenever something goes wrong,

02:19.660 --> 02:20.940
it’s Skips who fixes it.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.710
He’s always there for us,

02:22.710 --> 02:23.700
no matter what.

02:24.140 --> 02:24.750
I bet,

02:24.930 --> 02:26.130
Skips wants a party!

02:26.130 --> 02:28.030
But he’s such a quiet guy he doesn’t know how to ask!

02:28.110 --> 02:29.340
We owe him a party!

02:29.410 --> 02:30.330
And also a cake!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.400
Good show,

02:33.400 --> 02:35.010
jolly good show!

02:35.120 --> 02:37.570
Benson, the soiree for Skips,

02:37.570 --> 02:39.920
what a crackerjack idea!

02:40.470 --> 02:41.130
You’re right.

02:41.380 --> 02:41.980
Fine!

02:41.980 --> 02:43.710
If you two get Skips on board

02:43.710 --> 02:44.970
we’ll throw a party for him.

02:45.610 --> 02:47.530
We know how to get him on board.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.230
Okay!

02:50.570 --> 02:52.490
How will we get him on board?

02:53.070 --> 02:53.870
I know!

02:53.900 --> 02:55.220
Let’s get a van!

02:57.280 --> 02:58.980
Happy birthday, Skips!

02:59.140 --> 02:59.710
BAM!

02:59.710 --> 03:00.670
Free cake!

03:02.050 --> 03:02.980
No, dude.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.380
That’s kidnapping.

03:04.890 --> 03:06.380
But we can’t just tell him.

03:06.410 --> 03:07.360
You heard Benson,

03:07.360 --> 03:08.710
Skips isn’t in of this stuff.

03:08.970 --> 03:09.960
I know, but dude,

03:09.960 --> 03:10.840
Skips is cool!

03:10.840 --> 03:13.030
We should just go and tell him
we gonna throw him a party.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.030
Lame!

03:15.100 --> 03:15.510
What?

03:15.510 --> 03:16.330
What’s wrong with that?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.080
Two things:

03:17.120 --> 03:17.590
One

03:17.590 --> 03:19.050
no surprise and two

03:19.120 --> 03:20.270
no vans!

03:20.690 --> 03:21.250
That’s it!

03:21.320 --> 03:22.010
What? Vans?

03:22.070 --> 03:23.190
No! Surprise!

03:23.270 --> 03:23.650
Dude,

03:23.650 --> 03:25.360
We should throw Skips a surprise party!

03:25.410 --> 03:27.360
Dude, that’s perfect!

03:27.370 --> 03:28.800
Yeah I know.

03:28.850 --> 03:31.990
‘Cause no one can say NO to a surprise party!

03:31.990 --> 03:33.200
‘Cause they can’t!

03:33.240 --> 03:35.540
Free cake! Free cake!

03:36.290 --> 03:36.910
No,

03:36.910 --> 03:39.740
I don’t wanna hang out with
you guys at 8 o’clock tonight.

03:39.850 --> 03:40.920
Well, then..

03:40.920 --> 03:42.170
How about later tonight?

03:42.320 --> 03:42.820
No!

03:42.820 --> 03:44.430
I wanna be left alone!

03:47.420 --> 03:48.410
What do we do now?

03:49.190 --> 03:49.820
Dude!

03:50.020 --> 03:50.610
Check it!

03:50.920 --> 03:52.970
We’d just lie to Benson and get the cake first,

03:52.970 --> 03:54.740
and figure out the Skips part later.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.190
Sounds like a cake of the idea to me.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.440
Free cake! Free cake!

04:01.540 --> 04:03.740
Skips totally wants a birthday party.

04:03.770 --> 04:04.300
Really?

04:04.310 --> 04:05.710
How did you convince him?

04:05.940 --> 04:07.220
We told him there’s gonna be cake.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.720
He wants an extra-large chocolate one!

04:09.830 --> 04:10.670
Really?

04:11.310 --> 04:12.010
8 o’clock.

04:12.060 --> 04:12.700
His place.

04:12.830 --> 04:13.950
But he wants it to be a surprise,

04:13.950 --> 04:15.330
so if you see him don’t say anything.

04:17.970 --> 04:18.610
Okay.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.910
Here’s the key to the cake in a snack bar.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.420
I guess I’ll see you at 8.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.020
BUT IF YOU MORONS ARE LYING TO ME,

04:25.020 --> 04:27.770
YOU’LL BE ON DISH DUTY FOR THE NEXT MONTH!

04:38.590 --> 04:39.230
We did it!

04:39.230 --> 04:39.920
Let’s eat it!

04:39.940 --> 04:40.610
No!

04:40.690 --> 04:41.830
You heard Benson.

04:41.860 --> 04:43.170
Do you wanna be on dish duty?

04:44.670 --> 04:45.340
Fine!

04:45.340 --> 04:46.260
We’ll do dish duty.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.280
No, dude.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.660
We have to get Skips.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.190
Are you sure Skips is even here?

04:52.270 --> 04:54.780
Pops said Skips secludes himself in the woods.

04:54.810 --> 04:55.850
Where else should we look?

04:58.190 --> 04:59.260
Don’t touch that cake.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.620
It’s a medical emergency!

05:00.660 --> 05:02.070
You just ate a sandwich!

05:02.070 --> 05:03.120
Are you a doctor now?

05:03.120 --> 05:05.200
Did you go a medical school in a past 5 minutes?

05:05.250 --> 05:07.570
We’re saving it for the party, and that’s THAT.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.240
Do you see them?

05:10.390 --> 05:11.280
Not yet!

05:11.460 --> 05:13.180
Hit the lights. It’s almost 8 p.m.

05:15.780 --> 05:20.700
Skips is gonna be so surprised when
he comes and sees us totally naked!

05:20.730 --> 05:21.880
It’s not that kind of

05:21.880 --> 05:23.210
party, Muscle Man!

05:24.950 --> 05:26.280
Don’t turn on the lights!

05:27.780 --> 05:29.070
Man, it’s almost 8.

05:29.070 --> 05:30.780
We’re not gonna find him, let’s just eat it!

05:30.830 --> 05:32.130
No.

05:32.410 --> 05:33.540
Benson’s gonna get pissed,

05:33.540 --> 05:34.430
so we shouldn’t.

05:34.470 --> 05:36.430
Benson’s gonna get like that no matter what.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.430
Better to have no regrets!

05:38.640 --> 05:39.220
Dude!

05:39.220 --> 05:39.910
No!

05:40.650 --> 05:41.520
RIGBY!

05:41.830 --> 05:43.190
GET OFF!

05:50.410 --> 05:51.400
Dude! Quit it!

05:51.480 --> 05:52.800
You’re ruining the cake!

05:54.500 --> 05:55.010
Wait!

05:55.080 --> 05:55.670
What’s that?

05:57.720 --> 05:58.690
Sounds like some kind of..

05:58.790 --> 06:00.690
weird Aztec ritual..

06:00.950 --> 06:02.430
I think it’s coming from over there.

06:02.580 --> 06:03.550
We should go to check it out.

06:03.660 --> 06:04.270
That’s funny.

06:04.390 --> 06:06.090
Usually, if there’s a strange noise in the woods,

06:06.220 --> 06:07.190
you don’t check it out.

06:08.180 --> 06:08.800
Mordecai?

06:14.700 --> 06:15.890
What’s Skips doing?

06:16.140 --> 06:16.710
I don’t know.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.650
But it looks kind of important.

06:19.470 --> 06:20.980
Maybe we should leave him alone.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.100
What about the cake?

06:22.210 --> 06:23.970
Would you forget about the cake for a minute?

06:24.100 --> 06:24.820
Rigby!

06:25.940 --> 06:27.290
You’re coming with us, Skips!

06:27.290 --> 06:28.600
What are you doing!

06:30.640 --> 06:31.370
Fools!

06:31.800 --> 06:34.050
You interrupted my spirit dance!

06:34.150 --> 06:36.680
You don’t realize what you’ve done!

06:53.730 --> 06:54.520
Skips!

06:54.640 --> 06:57.690
You have broken the pacts
with the Guardians of Youth!

06:57.810 --> 06:58.270
Gary!

06:58.380 --> 06:59.710
You don’t have to do this!

07:00.190 --> 07:00.680
Listen!

07:00.830 --> 07:02.120
I’m just doing my job.

07:06.830 --> 07:07.210
Wait!

07:07.260 --> 07:08.390
Where are you taking him?

07:08.490 --> 07:10.130
I’m only the chauffeur.

07:12.190 --> 07:12.700
Dude!

07:12.910 --> 07:14.700
I think we just screwed Skips!

07:14.800 --> 07:15.830
And ourselves!

07:15.850 --> 07:17.490
No Skips, no cake!

07:17.620 --> 07:18.210
Come on!

07:18.210 --> 07:19.520
We better follow him!

07:34.000 --> 07:34.760
Dude!

07:34.910 --> 07:36.200
What the..

07:42.130 --> 07:42.670
Dude!

07:42.670 --> 07:44.150
What’s with the babies?

07:44.330 --> 07:45.740
We’ve got to get Skips back to the park.

07:46.140 --> 07:46.710
Shut up!

07:50.190 --> 07:51.960
Guardians of Eternal Youth!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.340
I have brought you

07:53.560 --> 07:54.620
the condemned!

07:54.970 --> 07:56.200
Skips!

07:56.250 --> 07:59.480
You have failed to complete the Spirit Dance!

07:59.520 --> 08:02.930
And thus the pact you made
with us for eternal youth

08:03.060 --> 08:04.600
has been broken!

08:04.670 --> 08:07.170
Now you shall shrivel into dust

08:07.230 --> 08:08.710
and disappear!

08:08.820 --> 08:10.090
Forever!

08:19.000 --> 08:20.580
SKIPS!!

08:24.190 --> 08:24.760
Wait!

08:24.950 --> 08:25.420
Wait!

08:25.450 --> 08:26.440
It’s not his fault!

08:26.490 --> 08:27.690
What's done

08:27.740 --> 08:28.870
is done!

08:29.200 --> 08:30.540
But this is our fault!

08:30.640 --> 08:32.870
We interrupted the dance before he could finish!

08:33.580 --> 08:35.220
Let him finish that dance thing!

08:35.320 --> 08:39.210
The decision of the Guardians cannot be overturned!

08:43.350 --> 08:44.630
SKIPS!

08:45.470 --> 08:46.750
We’re sorry, Skips!

08:46.810 --> 08:48.010
Yeah, we’re sorry!

08:48.490 --> 08:50.620
We just wanna to throw you a surprise party!

08:51.440 --> 08:53.170
It was going to be really cool.

08:53.210 --> 08:54.950
We were gonna eat cake..

08:54.990 --> 08:55.690
Cake?!

08:55.860 --> 08:57.940
Did someone say cake?

08:58.420 --> 08:58.850
No!

08:58.850 --> 08:59.490
There’s no cake!

08:59.520 --> 09:01.010
Wait, brothers!

09:01.080 --> 09:03.010
I smell cake!

09:03.230 --> 09:05.010
Do you smell it as well?

09:05.070 --> 09:06.170
I smell cake!

09:06.170 --> 09:06.860
As do I!

09:06.860 --> 09:08.100
Cake! Cake!

09:08.100 --> 09:08.530
Wait!

09:08.530 --> 09:09.780
You guys like cake?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.980
Yes! Yes! We love it!

09:12.030 --> 09:13.190
Give me the cake, dude!

09:13.190 --> 09:14.240
No way!

09:15.620 --> 09:17.130
So, you’re telling me you like

09:17.260 --> 09:18.100
cake?

09:18.410 --> 09:20.730
The blue one has cake! Cake!

09:20.730 --> 09:22.170
Give us the cake!

09:22.990 --> 09:24.550
The cake for Skips!

09:24.620 --> 09:26.200
Mordecai, what are you doing?!

09:26.290 --> 09:26.790
Dude!

09:26.790 --> 09:28.840
Do you want Skips to die on his birthday?

09:31.100 --> 09:32.010
All right!

09:32.430 --> 09:33.930
Do we have a deal?

09:36.950 --> 09:38.930
What flavor is it?

09:39.330 --> 09:40.280
Chocolate!

09:42.730 --> 09:45.270
We have reached a new decision!

09:45.340 --> 09:48.590
We will restore Skips’ youth in exchange

09:48.590 --> 09:50.070
for your cake!

09:52.430 --> 09:53.940
Now change him back!

09:53.940 --> 09:55.120
Done!

10:01.560 --> 10:02.300
What!

10:02.350 --> 10:03.720
They are not even eating it!

10:03.720 --> 10:06.240
They’re just smushing it on their faces!

10:06.580 --> 10:07.430
Be gone with you!

10:10.850 --> 10:12.820
Surprise!

10:12.880 --> 10:15.710
Let the merry making commence!

10:18.650 --> 10:21.040
You guys almost kill me for some cake?

10:21.220 --> 10:21.850
Here, Skips!

10:21.850 --> 10:23.130
We’ve got you a birthday present!

10:23.240 --> 10:25.250
It says: SKIPS; GODFATHER OF SOUL!

10:26.130 --> 10:29.700
No one’s ever thrown me
a birthday party before.

10:30.110 --> 10:30.840
Thanks!

10:31.090 --> 10:32.260
So, where’s the cake?

10:33.360 --> 10:33.960
Cake?

10:34.010 --> 10:35.640
I don’t remember anything about cake.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.430
Me neither.

10:36.430 --> 10:37.640
Must be a misunderstanding.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.920
The cake from the snack bar!

10:39.920 --> 10:42.320
Oh, you wanna that cake for this party?

10:45.090 --> 10:46.700
I mean what a mix-up, right?

10:46.700 --> 10:48.150
The important thing is we are all together.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.950
I knew I couldn’t trust you, idiots!

10:51.020 --> 10:52.950
You’re lucky Pops brought a spare!

10:53.090 --> 10:54.460
Happy birthday, Skips!

10:56.470 --> 10:57.210
Yes!

10:57.290 --> 10:58.130
Finally!

10:59.820 --> 11:01.050
Vanilla..
