40:07.280 --> 40:08.760
What the hell, Snap?

40:08.760 --> 40:11.200
It's gonna be OK.
How?

40:17.080 --> 40:18.080
MAN: What...

40:19.880 --> 40:21.920
(ROOSTER CROWS)

40:23.200 --> 40:27.040
Hey. Snap. Reg.
What are you boys up to?

40:27.040 --> 40:28.040
Come in.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.760
Jesus, mate.
Mate, grab a seat.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.320
This is a bit much, isn't it?
Ah. I found my mandarin.

40:33.320 --> 40:36.360
(CHUCKLES) Oh, mate, these guys are
just a little bit jumpy, that's all.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.680
Don't worry about them. No-one
lost an arm or a leg, did they?

40:39.680 --> 40:41.760
(CHUCKLES)

40:41.760 --> 40:44.480
Mate, are you bringing children
with you now, Snap?

40:44.480 --> 40:46.160
Oh, no, uh... No, that's Dimma.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.160
Hey, mate, what's...what's going on?

40:48.160 --> 40:49.760
Oh, mate, listen, there's...

40:50.840 --> 40:52.800
I'm actually
in a little bit of trouble.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.080
Yeah, this, um...

40:54.080 --> 40:55.240
What?

40:55.240 --> 40:58.160
This local girl. Um... Beautiful.

40:58.160 --> 41:02.560
And turns out she became pregnant,
and I was seeing her.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.600
And, um...her dad was not happy,

41:05.600 --> 41:08.880
so, um...he wanted me to marry her.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.520
(CHUCKLES) Can you believe that?

41:20.360 --> 41:24.400
Ha. Well, yeah, um...

41:24.400 --> 41:25.560
..he died.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.240
(LOCALS LAUGH)

41:29.240 --> 41:32.280
He died. You know?

But, hey, Snap, actually,
I'm in a bit of a bind

41:37.400 --> 41:40.280
'cause now half the island's
out looking for me.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.280
Not my fault.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.160
But I just thought
it might be prudent

41:43.160 --> 41:45.360
that, while the heat's on and...

41:45.360 --> 41:47.760
..you know, I'll just get
a couple of boys to back me up.

things get a bit gnarly.

Hey...

41:53.680 --> 41:56.720
..you boys have gone
to a bit of bother finding me here.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.720
Think I might know why.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.440
(LAUGHS)
Oh, look, maybe it's a bad idea.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.080
Yeah.
No, no, no. It's a very good idea.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.520
A bloody good idea.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.760
Having half the island looking
for you is very bad for business,

42:06.760 --> 42:08.440
so just show me what you got.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.880
Come on, Snap!
Just show me what you got!

Just make sure they don't leave.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.760
This is a really, really bad idea.

42:32.760 --> 42:35.040
Yeah, we'll just get the hash
and we'll get out of here.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.520
Do you trust him?
I don't know, OK?

42:37.520 --> 42:41.040
I didn't expect to walk in and see
this, so just get off my case.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.240
Alright?

42:47.080 --> 42:48.600
Reg, is this normal?

42:48.600 --> 42:50.440
It's far from fuckin' normal.
Just keep your head down.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.320
Here ya go, Snap. That should...

(GASPS)

42:53.560 --> 42:55.680
You right, mate?
Huh? What?

42:56.680 --> 42:58.400
Did you see that?

42:58.400 --> 43:00.200
There you go, mate.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.520
That's all in there.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.520
Plus a little extra
for your troubles.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.000
What's this?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.840
Mate, just ride the white horse
all the way to shore.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.800
Come on, don't be stupid, mate.
Is this your deal, is it, Reginald?

43:14.800 --> 43:16.560
Is it?!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.240
It's OK.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.680
Mate, this isn't what I came for.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.240
Do you know what the street value
of that little packet is?

43:24.240 --> 43:26.920
Not smack, mate.
This is way too heavy.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.800
You walk through with that,

43:28.800 --> 43:32.240
all your troubles
just - drrr! - disappear.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.200
I can't pay you for this.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.360

Eh?

did ya?

Oh. Um...

43:55.920 --> 43:57.080
No.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.000
No, no, no, he died.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.360
He is no longer with us.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.840
Yeah, sad.

44:04.760 --> 44:07.040
You can thank me later for that,
mate.

but Ocdo'll make you some noodles.

I know you've done it before.
