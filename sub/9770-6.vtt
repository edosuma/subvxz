to your arm?

01:24.459 --> 01:26.044
- Oh, I cut it
really bad

01:26.127 --> 01:26.544
when I was jumping
the fence behind the gym.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.339

That's--[gasping]

01:41.100 --> 01:42.393
spewing fake blood
out of your arm?

01:42.477 --> 01:43.353
- Just testing out
some new scares

01:43.436 --> 01:45.063
for this year's
haunted house.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.564
- What haunted house?

01:46.648 --> 01:48.107
- See, every Halloween,
the upper school does

01:48.191 --> 01:49.067
a haunted house
for the lower school.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.070
- And this year,
I'm in charge.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.905

- You've been ha'd.

02:03.748 --> 02:04.707
- By girls.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.876
- Whatever.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.086
But this haunted house
is gonna be

02:08.169 --> 02:09.503
majorly scary--

02:09.586 --> 02:10.588
not <i> girly</i> scary.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.052

one of your french fries?

02:16.135 --> 02:18.638

Oooh, is this some
of the scary stuff

03:23.828 --> 03:24.621

03:24.704 --> 03:26.956
- Hey! Uh-uh.
Outta here.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.249
- Why?

03:28.333 --> 03:29.709
- 'Cause I don't
want you seeing

03:29.792 --> 03:30.835
any of the haunted house stuff
till tonight.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.463
So just take
your little roommate and go.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.174
- Fine. Haunted houses
are stupid anyways.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.343

I've been to, like, 10 of them.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.313
And it's not just gonna
make you scream.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.482
It's gonna make you cry.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.319

Miss Marilyn Monroe!

04:30.520 --> 04:32.730
- Let's see.
Might you be looking for...

04:32.814 --> 04:34.565
a yellow brick road?

04:34.649 --> 04:37.193
- Yes.
See, I always wanted to be

04:37.276 --> 04:38.027
Dorothy for Halloween,

04:38.111 --> 04:40.405
but I want to be scary too,

04:40.488 --> 04:42.949
and Dorothy's not scary,
so Zoey thought

04:43.032 --> 04:45.702
of a great idea.
Look!

04:45.785 --> 04:47.286
- Ha ha.
So you're Dorothy...

04:47.370 --> 04:50.581
but with an axe
stuck in your back.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.917

Can't trust that Tin Man.

The bowtie and the dorky shirt.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.885

05:02.969 --> 05:04.887
- Right.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.348
I'm a big nerd.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.224
- Well, we gotta go help
the guys

- I know!

05:42.884 --> 05:43.968
And he's dressed up
as a mummy.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.095
That is so creative.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.681
I must make him love me.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.437
- [growls]

05:56.355 --> 05:57.774
- See, in the <i> Wizard of Oz,</i>

05:57.857 --> 05:58.983
Dorothy was from Kansas,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.234
and I'm from Kansas,
so this cannot be

06:00.318 --> 06:02.904
a more perfect costume
for me, don't you think?

06:02.987 --> 06:04.447
- O...k.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.742
- Yeah. So what's
your favorite vegetable?

06:07.825 --> 06:08.785
I like corn.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.953
You a corn guy?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.790
- Excuse us just for a sec.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.083
- What?

06:15.166 --> 06:18.211
- I think you're coming on
a little too strong.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.087
- But I have to marry him.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.047
- Ok, but you just need to--

06:21.130 --> 06:22.590
- Blaah!

06:22.673 --> 06:24.467
- Oh, hey, Chase.
- Hi, Chase.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.344
- What--you weren't scared?

06:26.427 --> 06:29.263
- Why would we be scared
of a magician?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.140
- A magic--no, no, no.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.100
I'm a vampire!

06:32.183 --> 06:34.435
- Hey, Mr. Magic.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.686
- I am a vampire!

06:35.770 --> 06:38.481
You guys want to see
my receipt for the costume?

06:38.564 --> 06:39.649
- No. I just need you
and your little girlfriends

06:39.732 --> 06:41.567
to come give me a hand
in the tunnel of doom.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.737
- Come on, let's go help him.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.657
You can do a magic trick
for me later.

06:49.909 --> 06:50.701
- I am not a magi--

06:52.954 --> 06:54.288

- Hey!

Cool haunted house!

06:59.335 --> 07:00.336
- Yeah.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.672

07:05.258 --> 07:07.218
Hey, you.
What's your name?

07:07.301 --> 07:08.678
- I'm Tim.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.846
- Well, Tim,

07:09.929 --> 07:10.888
you should not be
in a mummy costume.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.349
- Why not?

07:13.432 --> 07:14.350
- 'Cause Mark's dressed
as a mummy.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.351
- Who's Mark?

07:15.434 --> 07:16.686
- I'm Mark.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.354
- Why would you choose
a mummy costume

07:18.437 --> 07:19.272
when you knew Mark was
going to be a mummy?

07:19.355 --> 07:21.399
- How could I have known?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.067
- I wrote about it
on my blog.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.318
Now go change!

07:24.402 --> 07:26.195
- Why should I go ch--
- Go!

07:26.279 --> 07:28.364
- All right! Man!

your head bandages.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.622
Sit.
- All right.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.840

have to wait for it?

07:45.923 --> 07:47.550
But how come you--

07:47.633 --> 07:50.261
ok, just tell me why--

07:50.344 --> 07:52.388
ok, ok, fine.
I'll do it. Bye!

That Logan's always
ordering me around.

- Michael?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.232
- Yeah, it's me!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.483
Why are you screaming like that,

08:04.567 --> 08:06.068
giving me
a heart attack?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.153
- Sorry.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.363
But you look really scary.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.073
- Thanks.
Hey, you better go

08:11.157 --> 08:12.408
get your costume on, man.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.452
The haunted house starts
as soon as it gets dark.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.746
- Yeah. Shouldn't you
be there setting up?

08:16.829 --> 08:17.872
- No.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.083
for some delivery truck
bringing more stuff.

sorry I almost gave you
a heart attack.

It's goin' again.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.433
- Ok. Close your mouth.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.686
There we go.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.524
Now, I'm using
a powerful super-adhesive glue

08:45.608 --> 08:47.902
so these bandages
can't come off.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.780
[Mark mumbles]

08:50.863 --> 08:52.490
There. Done.

09:00.081 --> 09:00.957
Oh, I got some glue
on my fingers.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.250
Better go get
some solvent.

Be back in a sec.
