You go that way.
I'll go check on the others.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.375
that was the last time we saw her.

04:23.125 --> 04:25.625
So, how did you all say you knew her?

04:25.708 --> 04:28.625
Was it, like... Did you guys meet
in school or something?

04:29.416 --> 04:35.166
Not exactly. Aisha was from
another dimension, and so are we.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.958
-No. Of course. Yeah.
-We're not here by choice. We were exiled.

04:42.416 --> 04:46.416
And just when we got close to finding
our way home, we were separated.

04:47.625 --> 04:51.458
We searched for her, but with all
that happened during Partition,

04:52.708 --> 04:57.125
we assumed she got lost,
like so many others.

We've been around for 100 years,

-Okay. Not all of us. This kid's 17.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.833
Oh, good. That's a relief.

05:30.625 --> 05:33.791
You're right. She is adorable.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.333
I never said that.
Not that I don't think that.

05:37.416 --> 05:39.958
-I was trying to keep that to myself.
-AADAM: This is so awkward.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.166

-Come. It's getting a bit noisy here.
-AADAM: This is my house.

FARIHA: Did you even ask if she's hungry?
No one asked if she's hungry.

05:53.916 --> 05:56.500
I never got a chance to thank you
for saving me, by the way.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.291
The least we can do
is protect Aisha's family.

05:59.958 --> 06:03.250
We didn't even know she had any
until you put on that bangle

06:03.333 --> 06:05.083
and we sensed the presence of <i>Noor.</i>

06:06.791 --> 06:12.208
<i>Noor?</i> That means light, right?
Noor Girl. No, that's not it.

06:12.333 --> 06:16.583
There's <i>Noor</i> within us as well.
It slows down our aging, for one thing.

06:18.041 --> 06:21.458
But we can't access
its full potential in this dimension.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.333
But maybe because you're from here,
you can.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.458
What about Kamran?
Wasn't he born here too?

06:30.458 --> 06:32.958
That bangle helps you unlock the <i>Noor.</i>

06:33.750 --> 06:36.916
Maybe one day something
will do the same for him.

06:37.958 --> 06:41.666
I don't know. It seems like a lot of
bad things happen because of this bangle.

06:42.083 --> 06:45.916
Like, I dropped a kid off a building.
And then I got chased by drones.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.416
And so, I really don't think any good
can come of this.

06:51.708 --> 06:53.083
Of course it can.

06:54.166 --> 06:57.416
The bangle and its visions
brought you to me

06:58.208 --> 07:00.333
and to all the people
that you belong with.

07:01.791 --> 07:05.416
Those people out there just see you
as a kid playing dress-up.

07:06.041 --> 07:09.625
But I know that
you've inherited greatness.

07:12.791 --> 07:14.125
So you want my bangle?

07:18.250 --> 07:25.041
It was Aisha's wish to bring us all home.
And now you must finish what she started.

07:27.416 --> 07:30.125
So, where exactly is your home?

07:30.625 --> 07:34.833
And also, what are you? Like, what should
I call you? Like, what are we?

07:36.833 --> 07:42.500
In our home dimension, the <i>Noor</i> dimension,
we're known as the Clandestines.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.875
As to what we are, we've been called
<i>Ajnabi, Majnoon,</i> Unseen...

07:49.958 --> 07:51.166
The list goes on.

07:52.041 --> 07:55.125
But what we're most
commonly known as is <i>Djinn.</i>

07:56.916 --> 07:58.375
I'm sorry. Did you say <i>Djinn?</i>

08:03.666 --> 08:05.750
Dude, I just had
the craziest night of my...

08:05.833 --> 08:09.375
You can't just text me "I'm alive,"
and then go get a full eight hours, okay?

08:09.500 --> 08:12.458
It was insane. The police showed up
and asked about Night Light...

08:12.541 --> 08:14.916
Police? Did they send drones?
I was chased by drones.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.416
Also, we are trying to drop
the name Night Light.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.625
-What are you even talking about?
-It's a bad name.

08:19.708 --> 08:23.541
-It sounds like it's for five-year-olds.
-Kamala, focus.

08:24.916 --> 08:27.625
-I'm a <i>Djinn.</i>
-And tonic?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.625
(GROANS)

08:30.958 --> 08:35.875
I found out what I am,
and it's not Asgardian or alien,

08:36.583 --> 08:37.875
or anything cool like that.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.958
I'm, like, the stuff of
my childhood nightmares.

08:42.250 --> 08:45.291
See, there's, like, ghost stories,
and then there's <i>Djinn</i> stories.

08:45.375 --> 08:47.875
The <i>Djinn</i> stories are so much worse
because they're real.

08:47.958 --> 08:49.875
Where are you getting
all this information?

08:50.875 --> 08:55.250
So, like, a group of <i>Djinn</i> people saved me
from all the drone stuff last night.

08:56.375 --> 09:01.833
They call themselves the Clandestines.
And Kamran's one of them.

09:03.583 --> 09:06.250
Did I not say there was something weird
about that kid?

09:06.333 --> 09:07.416
They're really nice,

09:07.541 --> 09:10.833
but, like, they told me about the bangle
and my powers

09:10.916 --> 09:13.000
and my great-grandmother Aisha.

09:13.083 --> 09:16.916
So that's progress. Also, they need
my help, which means I need your help.

09:20.666 --> 09:24.208
I figured. Okay, yeah, sure.
I guess. Why not?

09:24.291 --> 09:28.625
I don't really know how I can help
a group of ghosts

09:29.416 --> 09:32.791
and their average-looking son.
I'm gonna need a lot more information.

09:32.875 --> 09:36.041
And I will tell you everything, okay?
Just, first...

09:37.083 --> 09:40.708
You're good at math. Do you know
anything about interdimensional travel

09:40.791 --> 09:42.333
off the top of your head?

09:43.333 --> 09:47.458
Specifically that of the <i>Noor</i> dimension?
That's N-O-O...

09:47.541 --> 09:51.125
Actually, that reminds me of a paper
I read. I think it's by Dr. Erik Selvig.

09:51.208 --> 09:54.916
Perfect. You re-read that. I actually have
to go pick up some stuff for the <i>mehndi.</i>

14:28.208 --> 14:29.250
Oh, yes.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.666
Mothers and daughters,
it is the eternal struggle.

14:32.583 --> 14:36.291
You will be sure not to
give your mother any trouble.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.750
(CHUCKLES) Me?

14:39.083 --> 14:43.041
-No. Wouldn't dream of it.
-No trouble. No, no, she's no trouble.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.041
No. She's a perfect angel.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.458
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
Good joke, everybody.

14:57.541 --> 15:01.666
Hilarious, but you're only supposed to
hide one pair of shoes,

15:01.750 --> 15:03.166
not all of my shoes.

AUNTIE RUBY: Hey, Sheikh Abdullah,
are you okay?

15:10.041 --> 15:13.875
I heard the FBI came and accused you
of being the Minaret Madman.

15:14.541 --> 15:19.583
No, no. Only a few Damage Control agents
came poking around the <i>Masjid.</i> No biggie.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.875
Did it sound like they knew
anything about her?

15:22.291 --> 15:27.166
The same things we know. That she's
a brown, most likely Muslim girl.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
They didn't seem
particularly happy about it.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.333
MUNEEBA: Oof,
the trouble this girl's causing,

15:32.416 --> 15:34.125
her mother should be ashamed of herself.

15:34.708 --> 15:37.125
Oh, Kamala, Bruno came by earlier.

15:37.416 --> 15:41.041
He said he couldn't get out of his shift,
but he has left this box for you.

15:47.208 --> 15:50.541
Right, yeah, just... There you go.
Hey, we're getting the hang of it.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.666
Good. Very good.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.791
The party is over there.

16:04.875 --> 16:07.416
What are you doing
out here all by yourself?

16:09.583 --> 16:15.125
Do you agree with everyone?
About our new masked neighbor?

16:15.250 --> 16:16.291
Mmm.

16:16.958 --> 16:17.958
Do you?

16:19.125 --> 16:22.875
Just thought it would be cool to have
a superhero who actually fights for us.

16:23.833 --> 16:27.666
But I don't know.
Maybe she's just making things worse.

16:29.416 --> 16:31.708
I doubt that boy from the minaret
would agree.

16:32.583 --> 16:33.583
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:34.166 --> 16:39.250
So, how does she convince everyone
that she's good?

16:40.291 --> 16:44.000
Good is not a thing you are, Kamala.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.416
It is a thing you do.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.333

17:34.625 --> 17:35.958
You missed quite the party.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.250
Ah...

17:39.875 --> 17:43.791
-Yeah, yeah. How are you doing?
-Can you keep a secret?

-Uh...
-Ta-da!

17:48.250 --> 17:49.500

17:50.166 --> 17:53.458
Muneeba forbids me from having these.
But, hey, look at them.

17:53.541 --> 17:58.791
You know, there's just something
about their syntheticness.

17:58.875 --> 18:03.458
-(LAUGHS) I just can't resist them.
-I got you covered, Mr. Khan.

18:07.125 --> 18:09.458
It's just something
for Cultural Studies class.

18:10.208 --> 18:11.833
-The <i>Djinn?</i>
-Yeah.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.666
-Let me have a look.
-No, I'm actually... I'm good.

18:14.791 --> 18:17.500

18:18.791 --> 18:20.083
It's written in Urdu.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.583
Hey, listen, I can help you with this.
Let me help you, huh?

18:24.416 --> 18:25.833
Okay, what do we have here?

18:26.833 --> 18:31.083
"Supernatural beings

to live out their days trapped in our own.

that will help them get home.

19:00.666 --> 19:06.541
"But to unlock such an ancient barrier
will require a primordial power."

19:08.625 --> 19:09.750
Interesting.

19:12.791 --> 19:16.041
Haven't heard that one before.
See you, Bruno.

19:16.958 --> 19:18.500
-Have a good night, Mr. Khan.
-Yeah.

19:23.416 --> 19:25.333
BRUNO: So I plugged in
the energy signatures

19:25.416 --> 19:27.416
from our tests on you
and I ran a simulation.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.875
What's up with your knee?

19:29.375 --> 19:31.166
You know when you bump into a drone,

19:31.250 --> 19:33.208
fall off a truck,
and don't feel it till later?

19:33.291 --> 19:35.833
Seriously, remember the paper
I was talking about?

19:35.916 --> 19:38.083
Theoretically, it's possible.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.625
For sure possible to achieve
interdimensional travel,

19:40.750 --> 19:44.125
but you need the base energy
of the sun, pretty much.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.000
What I realized is
all of these theoretical problems

19:47.083 --> 19:48.541
downplay the margin of error.

19:48.708 --> 19:50.375
And if you need the energy of the sun,

19:50.458 --> 19:52.541
think about how big
the margin of error must be.

19:53.916 --> 19:57.750
Try again. This time like
you have a social life. And go.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000

19:59.750 --> 20:03.708
If you help them go home,
some things might go boom.

-Kamala.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.541
-Might. There's a chance.
-Kamala.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.541
Might. So there's a chance.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.666
Okay? I think I have
this bangle for a reason.

20:17.625 --> 20:21.750
Like, obviously, I can't be the superhero.

20:23.416 --> 20:24.416
I don't know.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.791
Maybe this is something I need to do.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.750
Something good.

20:30.958 --> 20:32.041
I got into Caltech.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.833
What? I mean, that's awesome.
I didn't know you found out already.

20:39.916 --> 20:43.833
I did. And I think I need to go.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.166
But I can't leave unless
I know that you...

20:48.875 --> 20:50.791
You know, that everything is okay.

20:52.291 --> 20:55.708
-Why didn't you tell me sooner?
-I just think you've been busy.

21:00.083 --> 21:03.166
Look, Kamala, if you want to help
these people, I will help you help them.

21:03.291 --> 21:05.458
I will do the research,
help you figure things out.

21:05.541 --> 21:09.125
But just right now, today,

21:11.458 --> 21:13.458
I just don't see a safe way to do this.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.500
Carol Danvers wouldn't wait.

21:17.375 --> 21:20.083
She'd punch a hole in space and time
and she'd help them now.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.416
Then Carol Danvers would be reckless.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.500
Maybe it's not such a bad thing
that you're not her.
