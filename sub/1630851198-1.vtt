00:21.587 --> 00:23.556
Say I won't.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.359

00:33.466 --> 00:35.201
Get outta here, I got this.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.171
Get the fuck outta here!

00:54.621 --> 00:57.289
Mr. Russo's office,
this is Denise.

00:57.323 --> 00:59.358
I'm sorry,
he's still unavailable.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.897
So, this weekend?

01:04.931 --> 01:06.667
Oh, shit, I'm sorry,
I need ya, D.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.334
Okay, I'll tell Chris.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.672
Mitchell, I need those

01:11.705 --> 01:13.539
capital transfers
and banking agreements.

01:13.572 --> 01:15.574
We'll also need to assemble
the corporate structure charts,

01:15.609 --> 01:17.811
board governance documentation,
and risk disclosures.

01:20.346 --> 01:21.882
This guy's been calling all day.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.884
Do you know a Joey Donovan?

01:23.917 --> 01:26.252
Says he's from Rozzie.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.555
Ronnie Russo.

01:29.588 --> 01:31.524
Damn, Russo, you sound
like a bigger pussy now

01:31.557 --> 01:33.392
- than when you were 12.
- Holy shit, Joey?

01:34.728 --> 01:35.829
Long time.

01:37.831 --> 01:38.965
Hey, you all right?

01:38.999 --> 01:40.767
Fuck, no!

01:40.801 --> 01:41.768
I'm dyin'.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.606
Jesus, Joey, I'd love to,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.541
but, um, I'm really
under water right now.

01:48.574 --> 01:49.643
Yeah, yeah, all right.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.576
No, no, I get it.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.713
I mean, I could try
to come up next weekend,

01:52.746 --> 01:54.014
or something?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.649
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.985
I probably won't be here, but...

02:15.001 --> 02:16.670
What was that all about?

02:16.703 --> 02:17.738
I gotta go to Boston.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.371
You're kidding.

02:19.405 --> 02:22.475
No, I got somethin'
I need to take care of.

02:22.508 --> 02:24.276
What about the audit?

02:24.310 --> 02:26.046
Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.004
Fuck.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.038
No.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.339
Answer me.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.675
Fuck!

04:06.445 --> 04:07.914
Fuck, man.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.752
Hey, Joey,

04:12.786 --> 04:14.420
can you hear me?

04:14.453 --> 04:16.355
It's me, Ronnie.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.729
Be strong, man.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.997
You got this.

04:24.030 --> 04:27.968
I'm here for you,
you're gonna be okay.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.836
That's fuckin' beautiful, Russo.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.477
Joey fuckin' Donovan.

04:38.510 --> 04:39.980
That your new pal?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.081
You're an asshole.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.117
I knew you'd come.

04:46.585 --> 04:47.954
This how you stay
in such great shape?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.890
Uh, yeah, when I'm
not fuckin' your mother.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.725
That's gross.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.994
Come on, man,
make yourself comfortable.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.495
Hey, feel free to scoot
your buddy onto the floor

04:56.528 --> 04:57.463
and take his spot.

04:57.496 --> 04:58.397
Honestly, I don't think
he'd even notice.

04:58.430 --> 05:01.067
He's got, like,
zero personality, bro.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.534
Worst roommate.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.006
Hey, I'm just
fuckin' with you, Bobby.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.941
You know I think you're a riot.

05:07.974 --> 05:12.679
Go back to sleep,
you sick bastard.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.848
Hey, you know what
I was just thinkin' about?

05:14.881 --> 05:15.715
What?

05:19.819 --> 05:20.954
Oh, fuck.

05:20.987 --> 05:25.825
Remember that time that
I egged the Bannons' house?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.961
I thought we were both doin' it,
but then I turned around

05:27.994 --> 05:30.764
and you're already
half a block down bookin' it.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.499
I almost got caught,
I was laughin' so hard.

05:33.532 --> 05:34.401
You were like fuckin',

05:34.433 --> 05:36.603
you were like
fuckin' Flash Gordon.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.172
You know, your face
was all serious and shit.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.808
It was like a classic Russo.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.812
That's crazy, I,
I don't remember it, but...

05:45.845 --> 05:47.479
You don't remember?

05:47.513 --> 05:50.516
You don't remember?

05:50.549 --> 05:52.085
I remember.

05:52.118 --> 05:54.087
I'll remember for both of us.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.559
So, Rozzie's, uh,

06:00.592 --> 06:01.895
Rozzie's gotten better?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.763
Huh?

06:03.797 --> 06:06.967
Uh, yeah, I guess,
I mean, you know, it's, uh,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.236
it's a lot more
colorful now, though, so.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.570
Wow.

06:11.604 --> 06:12.272
Wow, really?

06:12.305 --> 06:13.139
That what we're doin'?

06:13.173 --> 06:14.741
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

06:14.774 --> 06:18.044
I meant there's
a lot more Black people.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.879
- Gotta deal with that shit.
- Oh, shit.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.748
- Really?
- Morning, Joey.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.149
What's up, Monique?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.951
Hi.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.821
Hey, Monique, do you need me
to get out of your way?

06:27.854 --> 06:29.723
- No, you're good.
- You're all right.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.691
She's gotta clean my,
uh, bullshit here...

06:31.725 --> 06:32.726
Ow, fuck me.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.794
Oh, my bad.

06:34.828 --> 06:35.962
That's good, thank you.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.732
You have a good visit
with your friend.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.134
Okay.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.103
Hey, did you see that,
she had,

06:43.136 --> 06:46.306
she, like, pushed down,
and was fuckin' intentional.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.540
- You deserved it.
- Oh, I did, huh?

06:48.574 --> 06:49.709
Well, you know what you deserve?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.878
- What?
- You deserve my dick.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.725
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.068
So, what, are you
too late for a transplant?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.270
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.905
You know, they,

07:18.938 --> 07:22.142
they told me
I had to go to meetings

07:22.175 --> 07:25.045
just to get on the fuckin' list.

07:25.078 --> 07:25.945
- And you didn't?
- Fuck that.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.080
- Nah, nah, fuck that.
- What the fuck?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.749
Hey, come on.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.053
Shit really worked
for my old man, right?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.823
Well, maybe...

07:36.856 --> 07:39.793
I don't know, maybe I,
maybe I can talk to someone.

07:39.826 --> 07:40.760
Yeah?

07:40.794 --> 07:41.895
What if I paid for your stay?

07:41.928 --> 07:45.632
You think maybe they'd
reconsider, or something?

07:45.665 --> 07:48.001
You're gonna fuckin'
buy me a liver?

07:49.803 --> 07:52.605
That's adorable.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.040
It's done, don't worry about it.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.875
You want some water?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.844
Please.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.214
Hey...

08:01.247 --> 08:04.284
you remember Pattie Barry?

08:04.317 --> 08:05.919
Yeah, I think
I had a crush on her,

08:05.952 --> 08:07.654
or something?

08:07.687 --> 08:09.956
No, you were fuckin'
nuts about her.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.192
No.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.127
- Don't fuckin' lie.
- Okay, yeah,

08:14.160 --> 08:17.330
- I remember, I remember her.
- Yeah, you do.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.166
Anyway, uh,

08:20.200 --> 08:22.702
me and her got married
a while back.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.404
Had a kid.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.005
- You married Pattie?
- Yes, relax,

08:26.039 --> 08:27.373
it didn't last too long.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.241
Total cunt.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.177
- Whoa.
- Whoa, you got delicate ears?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.413
Well, she won't
let me see my son.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.249
Ten fuckin' years now.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.217
What'd you do?

08:40.419 --> 08:43.089
What did I do?

08:43.123 --> 08:44.090
No, I...

08:44.124 --> 08:46.726
I just meant that
that's pretty extreme.

08:46.759 --> 08:50.029
So it had to be my fault?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.664
No, bro, I, I...

08:51.698 --> 08:53.766
- Dude, I just didn't...
- Just forget it.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.168
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- Forget it,

08:55.201 --> 08:57.270
don't worry about it.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.812
Do you think maybe
you could, uh,

09:05.845 --> 09:08.715
talk to her for me?

09:08.748 --> 09:11.050
What?

09:11.084 --> 09:14.454
I wanna see my son.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.757
I don't even know her, Joey.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.126
Yeah, I know, but you're
like a lawyer, right?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.395
Not that kind.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.764
What's the fuckin' difference?

09:24.797 --> 09:26.166
Look, Joey,
that's not why I came here.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.768
Look, I wanna see my son.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.370
Just need you to fuckin'
talk to her, that's all.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.238
I got so much work, man, I,

09:32.272 --> 09:35.775
- I just, I can't do it.
- Look, Ronnie,

09:35.808 --> 09:37.710
you're my last call,

09:37.744 --> 09:39.479
all right?

09:39.512 --> 09:43.183
I found you in that
Google article.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.285
I fuckin' knew you'd help me.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.056
And now you're sittin' there
in that fancy fuckin' suit,

09:50.089 --> 09:55.028
and you're tellin' me,
what, "No?"

09:55.061 --> 09:58.765
"No?" Fuck that, Russo.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.733
I wanna see my son.

10:08.474 --> 10:11.110
Okay, okay, o... okay.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.147
All right.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.016
I'll talk to her.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.987
Yeah.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.256
Sweet.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.524
It worked.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.194
Yeah, it worked.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.496
Jerk.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.065
Where is she?

10:32.098 --> 10:33.533
JP,

10:33.566 --> 10:35.468
114 Orchard.

10:35.501 --> 10:39.005
Hey, don't tell her you saw me,

10:39.038 --> 10:40.773
okay?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.508
Well, how the hell am I gonna
explain goin' to go see her,

10:42.542 --> 10:44.143
or even bring you your damn son?

10:44.177 --> 10:45.778
I don't know.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.046
- You're smarter than me.
- Jesus Christ.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.448
- That's not sayin' much.
- Fuck you.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.116
Fuck you!

10:50.149 --> 10:51.251
Hey, you wanna stay at my place?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.152
It's the same fuckin' house.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.921
Key's under the gnome out back.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.562
Just don't take 25 years
to come back this time, huh?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.903
It's takin' longer
than I thought.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.872
I'll check in tomorrow.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.842
Fuckin' shit.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.380
"Dear Pattie,

11:54.414 --> 11:57.150
I love you so much!"

11:57.183 --> 11:59.218
Shut up, Joey.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.587
Why you leave her those
love notes like a fairy, anyway?

12:01.622 --> 12:04.157
- You don't even sign 'em.
- She has to figure it out.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.892
It's mysterious.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.161
It's retarded.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.896
Dude, your eye.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.965
Don't worry,
I got him back.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.367
He's gonna kill you, dude.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.103
Nah, he won't even
know it's gone.

12:17.136 --> 12:18.471
Want some?

12:24.043 --> 12:26.579
Can't believe
you're movin' tomorrow.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.214
Yeah.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.571
Fuck it.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.962
Hey, Pattie,

13:15.995 --> 13:17.230
remember me?

13:17.263 --> 13:19.298
Just thought I'd
stop by and ask you to

13:19.332 --> 13:20.967
bring your son to see
his dyin' father.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.368
Cool?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.306
The fuck am I doin' here?

13:32.512 --> 13:34.046
Come on, JJ.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.682
Okay.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.314
See that home
hit in the eighth?

14:08.347 --> 14:09.315
Crushed it!

14:09.348 --> 14:11.150
Mo Vaughn's a fuckin' beast.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.485
This is the year, man.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.553
Hell, yeah!

14:16.522 --> 14:18.124
You leave that stupid note
for your girlfriend?

14:18.157 --> 14:19.592
Shut up,
she's not my girlfriend.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.494
I know 'cause you're too much
of a pussy to ask her.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.995
Just throw the damn ball.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.298
All right,
but here she comes now.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.066
Grounder!

14:27.967 --> 14:31.638
Keep your eyes
on your balls, Russo!

14:31.672 --> 14:33.406
Hey, Pattie!

14:33.439 --> 14:35.174
I know who's been
leaving you those notes!

14:35.208 --> 14:36.576
His name is Ro...

14:39.746 --> 14:41.682
You suck, man, you promised!

14:41.715 --> 14:45.485
Spaz, she likes you.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.720
I got you, man.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.222
No!

14:59.800 --> 15:00.701
There ya go!

15:00.734 --> 15:02.401
Way to keep your head in there!

15:02.435 --> 15:04.070
But I can't hit it out!

15:04.103 --> 15:05.505
So what, JJ, you're ten!

15:05.538 --> 15:06.506
Keep hitting line drives,

15:06.539 --> 15:08.274
and when you're bigger,
the homers will come.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.309
Okay.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.378
Let's lay down a bunt
before we go, okay?

15:14.648 --> 15:16.215
Nice!

15:16.249 --> 15:17.450
It's so boring, though!

15:17.483 --> 15:19.318
Well, fundamentals
ain't fun, kid.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.754
Let's pick up the balls.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.092
Kid's amazing.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.094
He is, indeed.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.830
You're a pretty
great coach, too.

15:29.863 --> 15:30.797
Thanks.

15:30.831 --> 15:32.265
Let's go, kiddo!

15:32.298 --> 15:35.836
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to, uh...

15:35.869 --> 15:37.336
Hey, this is gonna
sound weird,

15:37.370 --> 15:39.640
but is your name Pattie Barry?

15:39.673 --> 15:40.774
No, why?

15:40.807 --> 15:43.777
Oh, you just look like somebody
I knew a long time ago.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.779
Right, who are you?

15:45.812 --> 15:47.513
Ronnie Russo.

15:47.547 --> 15:51.384
Sorry, I don't know you.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.452
Okay, got it.

15:53.486 --> 15:57.523
Um, keep up the good
work anyway, okay?

15:57.557 --> 15:59.425
You know, maybe if you
left a note and ran away,

15:59.458 --> 16:03.830
I'd recognize you.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.737
So you and Joey Donovan?

16:10.771 --> 16:12.773
I never would have guessed.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.106
- Yeah.
- You, uh,

16:14.140 --> 16:16.309
you guys still in touch at all?

16:16.342 --> 16:19.278
No, we haven't had any
contact since the divorce.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.714
You?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.516
Um, no, not in a long time.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.554
Few more, JJ!

16:28.588 --> 16:30.891
Okay!

16:30.924 --> 16:32.325
So this is wild!

16:32.358 --> 16:35.361
What are you doing here again?

16:35.394 --> 16:36.495
Yeah, crazy, right?

16:36.529 --> 16:40.166
Um, I was in town visiting
my mother for the weekend,

16:40.199 --> 16:41.602
and just decided to come by

16:41.635 --> 16:43.469
and check out
the old neighborhood.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.537
How is your mom?

16:44.570 --> 16:45.772
Where's she living?

16:45.806 --> 16:47.440
Got a place in Dedham.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.375
That's good that you're
spending some time with her.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.210
It's important.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.846
Yeah, definitely.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.251
Well, it's been really good
catching up with you, Ronnie.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.654
We actually have to get going.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.188
Oh, uh...

17:02.221 --> 17:05.458
Hey, you wanna go out
to dinner tonight?

17:05.491 --> 17:08.527
Ronnie Russo's asking me
on a date to my face!

17:10.296 --> 17:11.932
So, is that a yes?

17:11.964 --> 17:14.300
Well, it's a little late
to get a sitter.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.801
Oh, right.

17:15.836 --> 17:18.704
Right, right.

17:18.739 --> 17:20.172
Listen, why don't you come
around the house tonight,

17:20.205 --> 17:23.275
and we'll grab some take-out?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.277
Okay.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.813
Look, Richard's coming in today.

17:26.847 --> 17:28.882
I'm not sure how long
I can keep covering for you.

17:28.915 --> 17:32.251
Look, don't worry about it,
I'll figure something out.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.453
Hey, listen, I want you
and Chris to book that place

17:34.487 --> 17:35.722
for some other weekend, okay?

17:35.756 --> 17:36.957
On me.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.257
You don't have to do that.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.359
I want to, you deserve it.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.967
Really?

18:29.710 --> 18:32.646
Oh!

18:32.679 --> 18:35.514
Fuck, Jesus, Joey!

19:21.594 --> 19:23.897
Joey, hey.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.766
Hey.

19:25.799 --> 19:27.834
How'd it go?

19:27.868 --> 19:28.902
Went good.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.670
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

19:30.704 --> 19:32.571
we're havin' dinner tonight,
and I need your help.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.775
You're havin' dinner,
like a fuckin' date?

19:34.808 --> 19:36.009
Thought you was
gonna talk to her.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.044
No, it's not that simple.

19:38.078 --> 19:39.780
- Uh-huh.
- No, just trust me, all right?

19:39.813 --> 19:40.747
I got a plan.

19:40.781 --> 19:42.883
You got a plan?

19:42.916 --> 19:44.985
Okay.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.053
This plan involve
banging my wife?

19:47.087 --> 19:48.487
Just hear me out, okay?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.724
I gotta get to know her,
I gotta earn her trust.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.092
Holy shit.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.629
Bro, you actually are
tryin' to fuck my wife.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.030
I am not tryin'
to fuck your ex-wife

19:57.063 --> 19:58.932
while you're on
your goddamn deathbed.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.670
Oh, my God, bro,
you're fuckin' sick.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.905
Yo, Bobby,
you hearin' this shit?

20:04.938 --> 20:07.741
Fuck you, okay?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.609
All right, lover boy,
what do you need?

20:09.643 --> 20:12.779
All right, we don't
have a lot of time.

20:12.813 --> 20:15.581
Nope, that's true.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.783
So, just give me the Cliff Notes

20:16.817 --> 20:18.718
so I can connect
with her faster.

20:18.752 --> 20:21.121
The Clip Notes? What's that?

20:21.154 --> 20:23.389
Just help me start off
on the right foot with her.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.491
You know, what does
she like to eat?

20:25.524 --> 20:26.559
Does she like wine?

20:26.592 --> 20:28.028
Should I bring flowers?

20:28.061 --> 20:30.462
All right, um,

20:30.496 --> 20:32.364
daisies.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.466
She loves daisies.

20:43.043 --> 20:44.878
- Hey!
- Hey.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.882
They're beautiful,
but I'm, uh, actually allergic.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.050
Oh.

20:53.687 --> 20:54.855
Come in.

20:54.888 --> 20:55.922
Yeah.

20:58.859 --> 21:01.460
So, is, uh, JJ
joinin' us for dinner?

21:01.493 --> 21:02.696
No, he, uh, he ate dinner.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.764
He's in his room
watching the game.

21:04.798 --> 21:06.532
Oh, right.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.001
He a big Sox fan?

21:08.034 --> 21:09.002
Oh, of course!

21:09.035 --> 21:12.105
I indoctrinated
him very early.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.807
Yeah, my mom too.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.675
She used to always
take me to Fenway.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.178
Oh, JJ's been dying to go.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.046
It's just things have been
a bit tight this year.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.616
Oh, well, I totally get that.

21:22.649 --> 21:26.552
My mom, I mean,
she just never paid the bills.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.520
I'm actually in the middle
of getting my Psy-D.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.589
- Oh, so you're in school?
- Post-doc.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.858
It's been amazing,
I get to see clients,

21:31.892 --> 21:33.960
I just don't get paid yet.

21:33.994 --> 21:36.428
I'm also finishing off
my dissertation, so.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.864
And bein' a mom.

21:37.898 --> 21:40.867
Oh, that part, I really love.

21:40.901 --> 21:42.802
So you wanna be a therapist?

21:42.836 --> 21:45.772
Yeah, family counselor.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.441
I can see that.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.612
So, uh, what kind of
law do you practice?

21:52.646 --> 21:54.180
Corporate.

21:54.214 --> 21:57.150
Yeah, mostly contracts,

21:57.183 --> 22:00.020
financial transactions,
regulatory compliance,

22:00.053 --> 22:01.087
nothin' sexy.

22:01.121 --> 22:02.322
Big companies?

22:02.355 --> 22:06.458
Yeah, yeah, we mostly just try
to protect them from themselves.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.095
And from the little people
they screw over?

22:09.129 --> 22:10.529
Well, I don't know about that.

22:10.562 --> 22:12.165
Your mom must be so proud.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.705
- I'm joking!
- Oh.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.473
No, seriously, though,
she must be thrilled!

22:21.507 --> 22:24.476
You've done very
well for yourself.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.712
Thanks.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.948
You're only a little evil.

22:27.981 --> 22:29.616
Aren't we all?

22:29.649 --> 22:30.516
I guess.

22:30.549 --> 22:31.550
Yes.

22:33.186 --> 22:36.189
So you and your mom
must be very close.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.924
Yeah, she's great.

22:37.958 --> 22:39.626
I mean, she raised me
all by herself.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.827
- Mm.
- Come on, that's bullshit!

22:40.860 --> 22:41.995
Hey, JJ!

22:42.028 --> 22:43.229
Language!

22:43.263 --> 22:44.831
Ugh, the Yankees hit a granny.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.834
Fuck!

22:47.867 --> 22:49.903
So I checked out
this vegetarian place.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.071
It's got great reviews.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.806
Yeah? You vegetarian?

22:52.839 --> 22:55.075
No, no, but I dabble.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.643
You?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.678
Pretty far from it.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.080
No shit.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.687
Oh, you know what?

23:07.721 --> 23:10.790
I forgot about the wine.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.059
Would you like to see
how it pairs with this

23:13.093 --> 23:14.928
delectable mess?

23:14.961 --> 23:18.631
I'm good with water,
but you go ahead.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.133
- Oh, you don't like the wine?
- No, I love wine,

23:20.166 --> 23:22.002
I just don't drink anymore.

23:22.035 --> 23:23.803
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize.

23:23.837 --> 23:27.807
No, it's fine! Seriously.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.142
How long?

23:29.175 --> 23:31.011
Since JJ was in my belly.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.748
That's amazing.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.049
It's survival.

23:39.019 --> 23:40.586
My mom was into pills.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.891
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.726
Nah, she's much better now.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.164
I'm glad to hear,

23:51.197 --> 23:55.835
but that must have been
really painful for you.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.904
So what made you
wanna be a therapist?

23:57.937 --> 23:59.339
Nice deflection!

23:59.372 --> 24:01.074
Now you're analyzing me.

24:01.107 --> 24:04.611
No, I'm not, I was
just wondering 'cause,

24:04.644 --> 24:06.746
I mean, I know it's
gotta be pretty hard.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.848
Well, I went through
a lot of shit,

24:08.882 --> 24:10.717
and I needed help,
but I got it,

24:10.750 --> 24:15.021
and then I realized
I wanted to help someone else.

24:15.055 --> 24:17.090
You know,
when people are in pain,

24:17.123 --> 24:19.626
they can't help but hurt others,

24:19.659 --> 24:22.896
and then the world sucks.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.265
Uh, I'm sorry.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.833
No, that's okay,
do you need to get it?

24:26.866 --> 24:29.235
Ugh, oh, no, it's just my job.

24:29.269 --> 24:31.137
On a Saturday night?

24:31.171 --> 24:32.705
Big meeting Tuesday.

24:32.739 --> 24:35.075
Big shot.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.212
We are so spoiled.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.781
Oh, yeah, it's a great time
to be a Boston fan.

24:41.815 --> 24:45.018
Just wish the Bruins
coulda pulled it off.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.253
Listen, I hate
to do this, but, um,

24:47.287 --> 24:50.256
I have a ton of work
to get through.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.892
Oh, oh, no problem.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.828
Um, before you go,
can I ask you something,

24:54.861 --> 24:58.965
and will you be honest with me?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.968
Um, okay?

25:04.337 --> 25:09.042
What were you doing
at the field today?

25:09.075 --> 25:11.077
What do you mean?

25:11.111 --> 25:14.314
I mean, I don't mean to
sound paranoid, it's just,

25:14.347 --> 25:17.383
it's a little weird, right?

25:17.417 --> 25:19.385
Yeah, weird, yes.

25:19.419 --> 25:21.254
I mean, I couldn't
believe it was you.

25:23.423 --> 25:27.193
Yeah, just
made me think of Joey.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.264
I don't know.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.000
You haven't spoken
to him, right?

25:34.033 --> 25:35.869
Not since we were kids.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.740
I mean, what happened?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.375
It's a long story.

25:42.408 --> 25:46.112
It's just messing
with me right now, it's... so.

25:48.481 --> 25:52.418
Pattie, I just wanted
to go by the ballpark.

25:52.452 --> 25:54.220
I played my last game there.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.028
I had a really great
time tonight, Pattie.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.063
Yeah, me too.

26:04.097 --> 26:06.833
Thanks for comin' over.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.434
You think I could
take you and JJ

26:08.468 --> 26:10.270
to a Sox game this weekend?

26:10.303 --> 26:12.071
That's very sweet
of you, but, um,

26:12.105 --> 26:14.174
I have a ton of work
to get through.

26:14.207 --> 26:16.409
Oh, right.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.745
Can't imagine
how hard you're workin'.

26:18.778 --> 26:19.812
Thank you.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.814
It's just that,

26:21.848 --> 26:25.451
you know, when you said JJ
was dyin' to go to a Sox game,

26:25.485 --> 26:29.289
I could really relate, you know?

26:29.322 --> 26:30.757
Listen, why don't you
come by tomorrow,

26:30.790 --> 26:33.426
and I'll take a break,
we can talk about it.

26:33.459 --> 26:37.163
Yeah?

26:37.197 --> 26:38.364
It's just that, you know,

26:38.398 --> 26:40.066
those tickets go really fast,

26:40.099 --> 26:43.336
and if you're gonna...

26:43.369 --> 26:45.271
Go spend some time
with your mom.

27:13.233 --> 27:14.434
Fuckin' Yankees.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.066
Hey, Denise,

27:47.100 --> 27:48.901
sorry I couldn't
answer the phone before.

27:48.935 --> 27:52.238
Don't worry about it,
did you listen to my voicemail?

27:52.272 --> 27:53.239
No, not yet.

27:53.273 --> 27:55.208
Richard needs
Gerton's Q-Two financials.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.277
Kellerman hit a wall.

27:57.310 --> 27:59.312
Well, then Susan has to get in
contact with Shanghai tonight

27:59.345 --> 28:00.947
and track 'em down.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.348
I'll ping her now.

28:02.382 --> 28:05.184
Okay, thanks, Denise.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.968
Hey!

28:22.001 --> 28:24.203
They're startin' some
no-name pitcher today.

28:24.237 --> 28:27.940
Yanks are gonna fuckin'
kill us again, bro.

28:27.974 --> 28:30.576
She loves red wine, huh?

28:30.611 --> 28:31.978
Oh, yeah.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.313
How'd your hot date go?

28:33.346 --> 28:35.014
Hysterical, Joey.

28:35.048 --> 28:36.115
You know I looked
like an idiot, right?

28:36.149 --> 28:37.016
- Did you?
- Yeah!

28:37.050 --> 28:37.917
I thought you were
gonna help me, man?

28:37.950 --> 28:40.119
Calm down, all right,
shit was funny.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.855
Yeah, you know you almost
ruined the whole plan, right?

28:42.889 --> 28:44.891
Really? That's not
a fuckin' plan.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.126
You want a plan? Go over
to Pattie's when she's out,

28:47.160 --> 28:49.228
get JJ, and bring him here.

28:49.262 --> 28:51.264
Kidnapping, that's a great plan.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.465
That's what I'd do.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.133
Yeah, I know.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.373
Fuckin' Sunday, and all that's
on is this bullshit, right?

29:00.406 --> 29:02.475
- Ugh.
- Ugh!

29:02.508 --> 29:05.912
- Ugh.
- Ugh!

29:05.945 --> 29:07.513
Ugh, do you think they
could hit the ball

29:07.547 --> 29:08.948
without screamin' like that?

29:08.981 --> 29:11.317
You wanna tell me
why she hates you?

29:11.351 --> 29:12.185
I don't know, Russo,

29:12.218 --> 29:14.921
I guess I was just
a shitty husband.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.592
You ever get violent with her?

29:24.597 --> 29:27.600
Is that what she told you?

29:27.634 --> 29:30.536
She didn't say anything.

29:30.570 --> 29:32.138
It's just she's got this
scar on her forehead...

29:32.171 --> 29:36.509
I never laid a hand on her,
Russo, I swear to God.

29:36.542 --> 29:40.146
I don't fuckin' do that shit.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.981
Okay.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.550
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- What the fuck, bro?

29:44.584 --> 29:47.987
- Whose side are you on here?
- I'm tryin' to help you out,

29:48.020 --> 29:49.489
but you're not exactly
makin' it easy, are you?

29:49.522 --> 29:51.658
Oh, I gave you the easy way.

29:51.692 --> 29:53.559
You're makin' it harder
than it has to be.

29:53.593 --> 29:55.261
Nah, that's ridiculous,
and you know it.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.697
What, should I get
locked up for 20 years?

29:56.730 --> 29:58.097
Is that what I should do?

29:58.131 --> 29:59.700
Nah, you should
get away with it.

29:59.733 --> 30:02.168
That can't happen, Joey, okay?

30:02.201 --> 30:03.670
All right, all right.

30:03.704 --> 30:06.506
Forget I asked.

30:06.539 --> 30:07.373
You wanna watch the game?

30:07.407 --> 30:08.975
Starts in about 20.

30:09.008 --> 30:12.245
Got a free bed.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.380
- Saddle up!
- Nah, I...

30:14.414 --> 30:16.115
got a lot of work to do, just...

30:16.149 --> 30:17.417
All right.

30:20.586 --> 30:24.257
Look, I think I can
get him to you.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.059
Yeah? What's the plan, boss?

30:27.093 --> 30:30.229
I wanna take him
to the game tomorrow.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.465
The Sox game?

30:32.498 --> 30:36.002
Yeah, I'm lookin'
at Monster seats.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.639
Fuck me.

30:38.672 --> 30:41.374
Wow, that sounds like
a nice family outing.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.042
Look, Joey, it's not like that.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.611
Fuck you, Russo!

30:44.645 --> 30:48.682
Seriously, man,
what the fuck are you doing?

30:48.715 --> 30:50.516
You gonna take her out,
you gonna be her best friend,

30:50.550 --> 30:52.418
and you're gonna
get in good with JJ?

30:52.452 --> 30:53.553
Good ol' Uncle Ronnie.

30:53.586 --> 30:56.489
How the fuck
does that help me, bro?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.257
You gotta at least
pretend that...

31:08.534 --> 31:10.737
Fuck you, I'm fine, thank you.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.175
Fuck.

31:18.679 --> 31:20.480
Bro, look,

31:20.513 --> 31:23.483
I gotta be a friend to her.

31:23.516 --> 31:26.586
Okay? I can't just
tell her what to do.

31:26.620 --> 31:29.623
I want you to
see your kid, Joey.

31:29.656 --> 31:32.358
Yeah, but when are you gonna
sack up and ask her?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.727
You know what, man,
fuck you, okay, Joey?

31:33.760 --> 31:36.028
I'm on it, all right?

31:36.062 --> 31:39.398
I got you, I promise.

31:39.432 --> 31:42.335
But you gotta let me
do it my way, okay?

31:42.368 --> 31:43.737
Or else, you know what,
you can get your sorry ass up

31:43.770 --> 31:46.205
and go get him
your goddamn self.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.681
Fuck yeah, now you're talkin'.

31:55.849 --> 31:58.351
Hey, I always wondered,

31:58.384 --> 32:01.053
how far'd you go?

32:01.087 --> 32:03.155
What do you mean?

32:03.189 --> 32:06.259
Baseball.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.227
You were really fuckin' good.

32:10.463 --> 32:12.833
Yeah, Joey, so were you.

32:15.636 --> 32:17.069
Here we go, Ronnie,
little base hit.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.272
Let's go, little Bingo.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.373
Here you go, Russo!

32:20.406 --> 32:22.074
No pitcher, no pitcher!

32:22.108 --> 32:24.377
Hit another dinger!

32:24.410 --> 32:26.546
Look at him, Russo,
he's scared of you.

32:26.579 --> 32:28.214
He's shakin'.

32:30.483 --> 32:31.852
Take your base!

32:31.885 --> 32:35.221
You're a pussy, Mahoney!

32:35.254 --> 32:36.122
Oh, yeah?

32:36.155 --> 32:37.256
See what happens
next time you're up.

32:37.290 --> 32:40.459
Cut it out, next pitcher
to hit someone is gone, got it?

32:40.493 --> 32:42.328
So he just gets away with it?

32:42.361 --> 32:46.432
Hey, you're three outs away
from somethin' special.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.734
Don't be dumb.

32:51.905 --> 32:53.439
Just two more outs.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.842
Here we go.

32:57.744 --> 32:59.846
Easy out, Joey.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.156
That's it!

33:10.189 --> 33:12.124
- You're outta here!
- Fuck you!

33:12.158 --> 33:13.727
Get outta here!

33:13.760 --> 33:14.728
Cute, real cute.

33:14.761 --> 33:17.463
- Fuck you.
- Get on the bench.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.599
Good game, good game, good game.

33:19.633 --> 33:22.703
Russo, that's the way you play.

33:22.736 --> 33:24.170
Great season, buddy.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.272
Good luck.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.874
What are you doing?

33:27.908 --> 33:29.643
No!

33:29.676 --> 33:31.177
Fuck outta here.

33:32.779 --> 33:36.282
Gonna fuckin' kill ya,
I swear to God!

33:36.315 --> 33:37.483
Why'd you do that?

33:37.516 --> 33:38.919
You coulda had a perfect game.

33:38.952 --> 33:40.887
A perfect game, dude.

33:40.921 --> 33:42.756
I got your back.

33:42.789 --> 33:44.357
Rozzie, kid.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.494
Hey, JJ!

34:21.527 --> 34:24.295
We, uh, haven't officially met.

34:24.330 --> 34:27.701
I'm Ronnie Russo,
friend of your mom's.

34:27.734 --> 34:28.567
I know.

34:28.601 --> 34:30.536
She's inside.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.271
Cool.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.406
Thanks.

34:35.676 --> 34:38.945
So, um, you're a big Sox fan?

34:38.978 --> 34:40.614
Me too.

34:40.647 --> 34:42.481
But you have New York plates.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.887
That's right.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.353
I just live in New York, though.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.723
I'm from Boston.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.456
Die-hard Sox fan.

34:54.493 --> 34:57.463
So, you think we're gonna
take it all this year, or what?

34:57.496 --> 35:01.233
Yeah, but we gotta
get better middle relief.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.436
We do cough up a lot of leads
in the sixth and the seventh.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.471
Exactly!

35:05.504 --> 35:07.506
You two talkin' politics?

35:07.540 --> 35:09.442
Ha-ha.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.812
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, stop it!

35:11.845 --> 35:12.846
Never.

35:12.879 --> 35:15.816
So, I got us three tickets
for tomorrow at 1:00

35:15.849 --> 35:17.818
on the Green Monster.

35:17.851 --> 35:20.352
Really? We're going to the game?

35:20.386 --> 35:22.388
Thought we were gonna
talk about this?

35:22.421 --> 35:24.725
I'm sorry, I just got excited.

35:24.758 --> 35:26.893
I had to get the tickets last
night, or I was gonna lose 'em.

35:26.927 --> 35:28.695
But we can go, can't we, Mom?

35:28.729 --> 35:30.931
I have to work,
I've got clients.

35:30.964 --> 35:33.532
But I really wanna go!

35:33.566 --> 35:35.367
Uh, I screwed this up.

35:35.401 --> 35:37.470
I'm, I'm sorry.

35:37.503 --> 35:38.638
Can I go, Mom?

35:38.672 --> 35:40.674
Please?

35:40.707 --> 35:42.274
I could take him.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.645
It'd be my pleasure.

35:45.679 --> 35:47.279
I don't know.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.815
Or, you guys
can have the tickets.

35:48.849 --> 35:51.685
I just really want you
to be able to take him.

35:51.718 --> 35:52.819
It'd mean a lot to me.

35:52.853 --> 35:54.553
- I really have to work.
- Come on, Mom!

35:54.587 --> 35:56.388
It's the Yankees!

35:59.425 --> 36:00.927
You think you can handle him?

36:00.961 --> 36:03.395
Absolutely!

36:03.429 --> 36:04.330
Okay.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.432
Yes! I'm going
to the game tomorrow!

36:06.465 --> 36:08.601
Monster seats, baby!

36:08.635 --> 36:11.671
- Back before dinner!
- Okay!

36:11.705 --> 36:15.075
So what are you gonna do
with the other ticket?

36:15.108 --> 36:16.643
Sell it, I guess.

36:16.676 --> 36:17.677
Take your mom!

36:17.711 --> 36:20.914
Pay her back for
all the games she took you to.

36:20.947 --> 36:22.548
Oh, yeah.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.550
I mean, I doubt she can
make it thought.

36:24.583 --> 36:28.320
Ask her.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.957
I assume you don't
have any of your own?

36:30.991 --> 36:33.894
No, not so far.

36:33.927 --> 36:37.363
- Mm.
- Oh, here, let me get you...

36:37.396 --> 36:39.933
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

36:52.078 --> 36:53.546
So, you, uh,

36:53.579 --> 36:55.849
you mentioned Joey yesterday.

36:55.882 --> 36:57.416
What's goin' on?

36:57.449 --> 37:00.120
Uh, a lot.

37:00.153 --> 37:02.722
Um, mainly he's sick.

37:02.756 --> 37:04.557
He's at the Faulkner.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.860
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

37:06.893 --> 37:09.495
It's actually really bad,
it's his liver.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.031
Maybe you should go see him.

37:11.064 --> 37:12.632
Oh, I,

37:12.666 --> 37:16.002
I don't know, Pattie,
it's been such a long time.

37:16.036 --> 37:18.905
Are you and JJ plannin'
on goin' to see him?

37:18.939 --> 37:20.974
No, I, uh,

37:21.007 --> 37:22.843
I don't think it's a good idea.

37:22.876 --> 37:24.510
No?

37:24.543 --> 37:27.413
Mm.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.949
Listen, um,

37:28.982 --> 37:30.516
will you do me a favor?

37:30.549 --> 37:31.852
Sure.

37:31.885 --> 37:33.887
Don't talk to JJ about him.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.991
Just the whole thing's
such a mess.

37:38.024 --> 37:40.459
Oh, okay.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.895
Yeah.

37:41.928 --> 37:45.431
Does JJ not know
what's goin' on with him?

37:45.464 --> 37:47.433
No, and I don't want him to.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.436
It would be too painful
and confusing.

37:50.469 --> 37:54.473
Oh, yeah, I mean, I get that.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.109
Don't worry, I'm...

37:56.142 --> 37:59.713
Yeah, thanks.

37:59.746 --> 38:02.749
So what happened?

38:02.782 --> 38:04.885
He was always so messed up.

38:04.918 --> 38:08.420
I mean, look what
he did to his father.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.156
His dad used to
beat him every day, Pattie.

38:10.190 --> 38:12.759
I'm not saying his father
didn't deserve it.

38:12.792 --> 38:14.526
But Joey was a kid!

38:14.560 --> 38:17.030
And look what he did,
it was so savage!

38:17.063 --> 38:22.002
So messed up,
and I thought I could fix him.

38:22.035 --> 38:23.703
How'd you guys end up together
in the first place?

38:23.737 --> 38:26.606
I'm still tryin' to
wrap my head around it.

38:28.975 --> 38:31.577
I was just as
fucked up as he was.

38:31.611 --> 38:33.146
That's impossible.

38:33.179 --> 38:35.447
Well, almost.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.549
He was a bouncer at a club,

38:37.583 --> 38:40.486
connections,
and I loved getting high.

38:40.519 --> 38:41.988
We used to party so much.

38:42.022 --> 38:43.757
Lot of drama.

38:43.790 --> 38:45.058
We got married, you know.

38:45.091 --> 38:46.492
Why not?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.862
Then, I got pregnant,

38:48.895 --> 38:52.632
and, um, everything changed.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.734
I always wanted to be a mom,

38:54.768 --> 38:56.970
so I got clean.

38:57.003 --> 38:58.905
- Wow.
- Mm.

38:58.939 --> 39:01.741
Tried to get him clean, but...

39:01.775 --> 39:04.644
he didn't want to.

39:04.678 --> 39:07.247
Did he, um,

39:07.280 --> 39:09.749
did he give you that?

39:09.783 --> 39:14.020
Mm, he drove us into a tree.

39:14.054 --> 39:17.223
JJ was so little.

39:17.257 --> 39:19.793
Lucky he was in his car seat.

39:19.826 --> 39:21.828
Holy shit.

39:21.861 --> 39:23.129
You know The Jamaicaway?

39:23.163 --> 39:25.198
Those fucked up
trees were like

39:25.231 --> 39:26.933
right next to the road.

39:26.967 --> 39:28.635
Yeah.

39:28.668 --> 39:30.770
I was always wondering
who was hitting them.

39:37.677 --> 39:39.980
Hey, Ronnie?

39:40.013 --> 39:42.115
You shoulda signed those notes.

39:45.085 --> 39:46.853
I know.

40:17.751 --> 40:19.886
Yo, bro.

40:19.919 --> 40:22.188
Big game tomorrow, you ready?

40:22.222 --> 40:24.290
Fuckin' Yankees suck!

40:24.324 --> 40:27.627
Yankees... Oh, fuck.

40:27.660 --> 40:30.196
They got me on
the good shit now, bro.

40:30.230 --> 40:33.299
You crashed your
family into a tree?

40:33.333 --> 40:37.037
Oh, fuck!

40:37.070 --> 40:40.640
Jesus Christ.

40:40.673 --> 40:42.609
That was an accident.

40:42.642 --> 40:46.046
It was a fucking accident,
all right, Russo?

40:46.079 --> 40:48.248
Jesus.

40:48.281 --> 40:49.783
Were you drunk, Joey?

40:53.386 --> 40:56.022
Fuck no.

40:56.056 --> 40:59.859
She say I was?

40:59.893 --> 41:01.895
I wasn't drunk.

41:01.928 --> 41:04.230
Ask her.

41:04.264 --> 41:06.966
Was wet out.
I slipped. That's all.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.736
And why didn't you tell me when
I asked you why she left you?

41:09.769 --> 41:12.272
I told you,
I was a shitty husband.

41:14.340 --> 41:18.044
And yeah, I was drunk a lot.

41:20.113 --> 41:21.714
But not that night.

41:23.917 --> 41:27.220
- JJ was in the car, man.
- I know! I was fuckin' there!

41:33.326 --> 41:35.161
It sucked.

41:35.195 --> 41:37.163
But he was fine.

41:37.197 --> 41:38.965
Me and her
were a little messed up,

41:38.998 --> 41:42.969
but JJ was fine,
and she won't let it go.

41:43.002 --> 41:44.270
Yeah, well, she still
seems pretty freaked out

41:44.304 --> 41:45.371
about the whole damn thing.

41:45.405 --> 41:48.808
I don't know what to tell you.

41:48.842 --> 41:52.145
How do you blame someone
for an accident for this long?

41:52.178 --> 41:55.615
Fuckin' dying here, and this is
why she won't let me see my son?

41:57.183 --> 42:00.253
You know what it is?

42:00.286 --> 42:01.888
She's sober.

42:03.356 --> 42:06.059
You ever know
any sober chicks?

42:06.092 --> 42:10.363
Fucking bat shit, bro, for real.

42:10.396 --> 42:12.432
All they wanna do is get
fucked up and they can't,

42:12.465 --> 42:14.801
so they hate everybody,
especially if you have a drink,

42:14.834 --> 42:17.837
God forbid.

42:17.871 --> 42:21.274
They can't get fucked up,
so they fuck you up.

42:21.307 --> 42:23.309
And she's supposed
to forgive me.

42:23.343 --> 42:25.345
It's part of her Step shit.

42:30.950 --> 42:32.819
It was 10 years ago, man.

42:37.323 --> 42:38.691
I don't know what to say.

42:41.161 --> 42:45.231
I can't make you believe me,
but it's the truth.

42:45.265 --> 42:47.033
She knows I wasn't drunk
that night.

42:47.066 --> 42:49.702
Ask her tomorrow, at the game.

42:49.736 --> 42:51.404
She's not even gonna fuckin' be
at the game, guy.

42:51.437 --> 42:53.072
What d'ya mean?

42:53.106 --> 42:55.008
She's gotta work.

42:56.809 --> 42:58.044
So you...

42:59.812 --> 43:02.348
That's it.

43:02.382 --> 43:04.350
Just bring him by
after the game.

43:04.384 --> 43:05.351
No.

43:05.385 --> 43:06.920
Joey, she made me promise

43:06.953 --> 43:08.721
not to even mention you
to the kid.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.323
- Don't tell him it's me.
- Joey.

43:10.356 --> 43:11.591
No. Don't tell him who I am.

43:11.625 --> 43:15.762
Just say, you know, I'm like a,
you know, I'm an old friend.

43:15.795 --> 43:18.298
I won't say anything.

43:18.331 --> 43:19.933
Please?

43:22.268 --> 43:24.003
I gotta see him.

43:26.272 --> 43:29.342
Maybe JJ wants to see
his old man one time.

43:32.946 --> 43:34.280
Wouldn't you?

44:05.044 --> 44:07.213
Are you excited
to spice it up?

44:13.853 --> 44:15.288
Hey, Mom.

44:17.257 --> 44:18.391
Oh.

44:19.959 --> 44:20.960
Oh.

44:22.929 --> 44:25.164
Oh. Mm.

44:27.900 --> 44:29.535
Okay. Okay.

44:31.938 --> 44:34.207
You look wonderful, Ronnie.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.476
Oh, it's such a treat
to see you.

44:40.480 --> 44:41.581
I'm sorry it's been so long.

44:41.615 --> 44:43.816
- I just...
- No, it's okay.

44:43.850 --> 44:44.718
I know.

44:44.752 --> 44:47.086
You're very busy
with all your big deals.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.823
It's just... it's wonderful to see
my handsome son here again.

44:50.857 --> 44:52.058
Okay, Mom.

44:52.091 --> 44:55.895
I wish you'd've given me
a little bit of notice, though.

44:55.928 --> 45:00.300
I would've cleaned up
a little bit.

45:00.333 --> 45:03.469
Just, um,
don't hold it against me.

45:03.503 --> 45:05.438
Okay?

45:05.471 --> 45:08.274
I'll try to come by more often.

45:08.308 --> 45:10.043
That would be nice.

45:11.411 --> 45:13.079
Hey, you wanna play Whist?

45:13.112 --> 45:14.615
I got some cards here
somewhere...

45:14.648 --> 45:16.349
I haven't played...

45:16.382 --> 45:17.583
No, you never forget.

45:17.618 --> 45:20.286
It's like riding a bike.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.288
Where'd I put them?

45:22.322 --> 45:24.557
Can I ask you something?

45:26.025 --> 45:27.493
- Ma!
- Huh?

45:31.297 --> 45:32.498
Is there anything
you know about my father

45:32.532 --> 45:34.000
that you never told me?

45:35.568 --> 45:38.104
Oh, that was so long ago.

45:38.137 --> 45:39.105
Okay?

45:39.138 --> 45:41.274
I told you everything.

45:41.307 --> 45:43.076
You said he was handsome
and successful.

45:43.109 --> 45:45.612
- That's it.
- Well, he was, yeah.

45:45.646 --> 45:47.013
And that you had a special time.

45:47.046 --> 45:48.314
What was it, one night?

45:48.348 --> 45:49.315
Wasted?

45:49.349 --> 45:51.217
Okay, spare your judgment.

45:51.250 --> 45:52.885
Okay?

45:52.919 --> 45:54.987
I was just having fun.

45:55.021 --> 45:57.357
I didn't expect to make you.

45:57.390 --> 45:59.158
So you really don't know
his name?

45:59.192 --> 46:04.931
Look, do you think I wanted
to have a baby all alone, hm?

46:04.964 --> 46:06.466
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

46:06.499 --> 46:08.234
Yeah, you told me.

46:08.267 --> 46:11.971
People weren't
exactly sympathetic, you know?

46:12.004 --> 46:13.573
Well, you know.

46:14.941 --> 46:16.876
You had to deal with it, too.

46:19.078 --> 46:20.647
Did he even know about me?

46:23.483 --> 46:24.685
Who?

46:24.718 --> 46:27.253
My father. Jesus, Ma, do...

46:27.286 --> 46:30.089
You really had no idea
who he is.

46:30.123 --> 46:32.158
I raised you.

46:32.191 --> 46:33.960
Okay?

46:33.993 --> 46:34.994
Remember that.

46:35.027 --> 46:36.429
I did.

46:39.198 --> 46:40.967
Of course.

46:46.572 --> 46:49.108
So you got all your pills
in check and everything?

46:52.178 --> 46:53.647
Are you okay?

46:55.515 --> 46:57.116
I'm good.

46:58.351 --> 47:00.420
Are you still doin...

47:00.453 --> 47:01.454
Oh my God.

47:01.487 --> 47:02.723
You are.

47:02.756 --> 47:04.190
- Why?
- I'm fine.

47:04.223 --> 47:05.992
- Why do you do that?
- Stop.

47:06.025 --> 47:07.360
- What happened to you?
- Stop. Stop.

47:07.393 --> 47:09.562
- What did I do?
- I gotta go.

47:10.596 --> 47:11.431
Yeah, no, she's good

47:11.464 --> 47:12.165
but she won't be able
to make it.

47:12.198 --> 47:14.167
She's got friends coming over.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.636
Yeah, great, right?

47:15.669 --> 47:18.070
So I'm gonna pick up JJ
around 10 o'clock,

47:18.104 --> 47:19.305
so we can make batting practice.

47:19.338 --> 47:20.674
Sound good?

47:20.707 --> 47:22.275
Okay, great, see you then.

47:29.315 --> 47:31.017
- Denise.
- Finally.

47:31.050 --> 47:32.351
Where we at?

47:37.223 --> 47:38.024
Talk to me.

47:38.057 --> 47:40.159
Susan hit a dead end
with Shanghai.

47:40.193 --> 47:40.960
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

47:40.993 --> 47:42.462
Mitchell says
he can handle it.

47:42.495 --> 47:44.597
No. No. Do not let Mitchell
anywhere near this.

47:44.631 --> 47:46.098
I got it.

47:48.434 --> 47:49.602
Susan. Russo.

47:49.636 --> 47:51.705
Who'd you talk to over there?

47:51.738 --> 47:53.372
Who?

47:53.406 --> 47:54.373
No, no, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

47:54.407 --> 47:55.308
I'm gonna make a call.

47:55.341 --> 47:57.210
Just spell the name,
give me the number.

47:59.145 --> 48:00.112
Well, yes, I've been holding.

48:00.146 --> 48:01.247
I just need to speak to...

48:01.280 --> 48:03.149
Hell... hello?

48:03.182 --> 48:04.517
Hello?

48:04.550 --> 48:06.185
Fuck!

48:08.387 --> 48:09.422
No. No.

48:09.455 --> 48:11.591
Still here.

48:11.625 --> 48:12.458
Yes, ma'am.

48:12.492 --> 48:13.493
I've been holding
for quite some...

48:13.526 --> 48:15.762
Well, I've been holding
for quite some time now.

48:15.796 --> 48:16.797
No, I'm not being rude.

48:16.830 --> 48:18.231
I'm just holding.

48:18.264 --> 48:20.399
That's right. Yes.

48:20.433 --> 48:22.669
I wouldn't say that, ma'am.

48:22.703 --> 48:24.437
No, this looks like everything.

48:24.470 --> 48:27.808
I'll call you
if we need anything else.

48:27.841 --> 48:29.208
Yeah.

48:57.203 --> 48:59.272
You think he passed out yet?

48:59.305 --> 49:00.172
I don't know.

49:00.206 --> 49:03.509
What if he's awake
when you go in?

49:03.543 --> 49:05.746
Why you goin' to that
fuckin' nerd school, anyway?

49:05.779 --> 49:07.480
You're such a dick.

49:07.513 --> 49:09.415
I'll be back to visit, asshole.

49:09.448 --> 49:11.050
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

49:17.758 --> 49:20.493
Hey, you should have this.

49:20.526 --> 49:23.095
Why? O'Malley gave it to you.

49:23.129 --> 49:26.232
He would've gave it to you
if you weren't such a douchebag.

49:26.265 --> 49:27.366
Yeah.

49:27.400 --> 49:28.568
I had a perfect game goin'.

49:28.601 --> 49:31.470
Two more outs.

49:31.504 --> 49:32.773
Fuck it.

49:32.806 --> 49:34.775
First you gotta autograph it
for me.

49:34.808 --> 49:37.276
Make it to the bigs,
maybe it'll be worth something.

50:05.304 --> 50:07.306
Shut the fuck up.

50:11.678 --> 50:14.380
Bloody...

50:14.413 --> 50:16.617
Fuckin', no.

50:19.552 --> 50:20.754
Oh, shit.

50:22.321 --> 50:23.322
Oh, fuck. Oh, no.

50:23.356 --> 50:25.191
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

50:27.393 --> 50:29.428
Shut the fuck up! Fuck.

50:31.197 --> 50:33.232
I am so, so sorry.

50:33.265 --> 50:34.701
Just drive safely, please.

50:34.735 --> 50:36.202
Oh, of course.

50:37.638 --> 50:39.640
- Put your seatbelt on, buddy.
- Have fun.

50:39.673 --> 50:40.807
Yeah.

50:44.711 --> 50:46.579
Hope it doesn't get rained out.

50:46.613 --> 50:48.447
Nah, it's supposed to pass.

50:50.884 --> 50:52.719
- You ready?
- Yeah.

50:54.220 --> 50:56.422
Awesome. Thanks.

51:02.763 --> 51:04.296
Wait.

51:04.330 --> 51:06.232
Aren't these for yesterday?

51:06.265 --> 51:07.734
What?

51:07.768 --> 51:10.436
Yeah. See?
Sunday the second.

51:10.469 --> 51:12.639
Today's Monday the third.

51:12.673 --> 51:14.641
Same start time, different days.

51:14.675 --> 51:16.442
That can't be right.

51:19.245 --> 51:20.212
Holy shit.

51:21.313 --> 51:23.349
So we're not going?

51:27.253 --> 51:29.588
Top of the eighth
and the Yankees are expanding

51:29.623 --> 51:31.825
a 12-3 lead.

51:31.858 --> 51:34.360
I'm sorry, JJ. I...

51:34.393 --> 51:35.394
I really screwed up.

51:35.428 --> 51:36.897
We should be in there.

51:36.930 --> 51:38.497
We're getting killed anyway.

51:40.634 --> 51:42.601
That's your mom.
You mind if I text her back?

51:42.636 --> 51:44.236
Go ahead.

51:52.979 --> 51:53.947
Here.

51:57.684 --> 51:58.685
- Oh great...
- I could've caught that

51:58.719 --> 52:00.486
and I'm fucking 10.

52:00.519 --> 52:02.022
What'd you say?

52:02.055 --> 52:03.522
Nothing.

52:03.556 --> 52:05.659
Please don't tell my mom.

52:07.994 --> 52:10.296
- You got it.
- Thanks.

52:12.999 --> 52:14.600
You were right, by the way.

52:18.004 --> 52:19.472
Should I kill it?

52:19.505 --> 52:21.240
Go ahead.

52:27.781 --> 52:29.548
Hey, does your mom...

52:31.550 --> 52:33.486
Has she had any boyfriends?

52:33.519 --> 52:34.654
Yeah.

52:36.455 --> 52:38.024
You like any of 'em?

52:38.058 --> 52:39.025
No.

52:41.594 --> 52:43.329
Yeah.

52:43.362 --> 52:46.066
I didn't like any of
my mom's boyfriends, either.

52:46.099 --> 52:47.701
Really?

52:47.734 --> 52:49.535
Pfsh.

52:49.568 --> 52:53.305
They were either corny or jerks.

52:53.339 --> 52:56.475
Tried too hard to be my friend
or they ignored me altogether.

52:58.612 --> 53:00.546
I was worried my mom
would marry one of 'em.

53:00.579 --> 53:02.082
You know?

53:02.115 --> 53:04.517
I mean, I wanted a dad,

53:04.550 --> 53:05.584
but I didn't want any of them.

53:05.619 --> 53:08.454
I wanted my dad, you know?

53:08.487 --> 53:09.823
Totally.

53:13.592 --> 53:14.694
Hey, let's get rollin', okay?

53:15.862 --> 53:17.731
Why'd you lie to my mom?

53:21.600 --> 53:22.803
What d'ya mean?

53:22.836 --> 53:24.838
In the text.

53:26.873 --> 53:28.742
Ah.

53:28.775 --> 53:30.710
You saw that, huh?

53:30.744 --> 53:35.314
I mean, like, it's nothing big
or anything, but still.

53:38.885 --> 53:41.021
I guess it's just easier,
sometimes.

53:41.054 --> 53:42.656
But it's wrong.

53:45.759 --> 53:47.493
You're right, JJ, it is.

53:50.931 --> 53:52.464
Come on.

54:06.646 --> 54:08.615
Hey, JJ,
can I ask you a question?

54:08.648 --> 54:09.850
Yeah.

54:11.751 --> 54:13.720
Would you ever wanna see
your dad, if you could?

54:15.755 --> 54:18.692
I mean, I really wanted to see
my own when I was your age.

54:18.725 --> 54:20.492
What about you?

54:20.526 --> 54:22.528
You ever wanna see your dad?

54:22.561 --> 54:23.897
Yeah.

54:27.868 --> 54:29.769
How 'bout now?

54:29.803 --> 54:31.004
What do you mean?

54:31.037 --> 54:32.172
He's dead.

54:33.807 --> 54:34.774
What?

54:34.808 --> 54:36.676
He's dead.

54:36.710 --> 54:39.112
He died in a car accident
when I was a baby.

54:43.482 --> 54:46.786
Light's green.

54:46.820 --> 54:47.787
Yeah.

55:09.075 --> 55:10.110
Whoa.

55:10.143 --> 55:11.745
I guess we lost.

55:14.114 --> 55:16.082
You told him his father died?

55:18.251 --> 55:19.920
Where is he?

55:19.953 --> 55:21.721
He's in his room
doing his homework.

55:21.755 --> 55:23.890
What did you say to him?

55:23.924 --> 55:26.092
He doesn't know anything.

55:26.126 --> 55:29.561
- Well, how did...
- It came up.

55:29.595 --> 55:30.764
Really?

55:30.797 --> 55:32.899
It came up?

55:32.933 --> 55:34.100
I thought he'd want a chance
to see his father,

55:34.134 --> 55:35.235
so I asked him.

55:35.268 --> 55:37.704
The fuck would you ask him that?

55:37.737 --> 55:40.539
'Cause Joey's
gonna be gone soon.

55:40.572 --> 55:42.508
And I thought JJ should
have a chance to see him.

55:42.541 --> 55:44.244
Oh, that's what you thought?

55:44.277 --> 55:46.179
Yeah.

55:46.212 --> 55:48.014
It's all Joey wants.

55:48.048 --> 55:50.183
And it seemed like
JJ wanted it, too.

55:50.216 --> 55:53.653
And how do you know
what Joey wants?

55:53.687 --> 55:56.522
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

55:56.555 --> 55:58.758
I've been talking to Joey.

55:58.792 --> 56:00.559
I came to Rozzie to see him.

56:00.592 --> 56:01.560
I fuckin' knew it.

56:01.593 --> 56:03.797
This whole time
I thought I was going crazy.

56:03.830 --> 56:04.731
I didn't...

56:04.764 --> 56:05.799
And visiting your mom?

56:05.832 --> 56:07.901
You are a fuckin' liar.

56:07.934 --> 56:10.136
- Jesus.
- I was just...

56:10.170 --> 56:13.707
I was just gonna try to get you
to bring him to see him.

56:13.740 --> 56:14.941
That's what Joey asked me to do.

56:14.975 --> 56:18.912
So you were gonna take my son
to see Joey behind my back?

56:18.945 --> 56:20.246
What were you gonna do,
walk him into the hospital

56:20.280 --> 56:22.082
and show him a dying drunk guy
and say what,

56:22.115 --> 56:23.717
"That's your father"?

56:23.750 --> 56:24.818
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

56:24.851 --> 56:26.219
I didn't.

56:26.252 --> 56:28.655
Get the fuck outta here, Russo.

56:28.688 --> 56:29.723
Get out.

56:29.756 --> 56:31.523
I knew as soon as I saw those
burns on your arm.

56:31.557 --> 56:33.626
I am such an idiot.

56:34.761 --> 56:36.763
You know what?

56:36.796 --> 56:39.132
JJ's gonna find out some day.

56:39.165 --> 56:41.868
And he's gonna
fuckin' hate you for it.

56:41.901 --> 56:44.004
You think I wanted
to tell him that?

56:44.037 --> 56:45.105
Do you think I had a choice?

56:45.138 --> 56:47.107
There's always a choice, Pattie.

56:47.140 --> 56:48.708
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:48.742 --> 56:51.077
My choice was a dead father
or a drunk asshole

56:51.111 --> 56:52.679
that wants nothing to do
with his son.

56:52.712 --> 56:53.913
What would you have done?

56:53.947 --> 56:55.615
No, but Joey always
wanted to see him.

56:55.648 --> 56:57.183
The first time
he ever asked about him

56:57.217 --> 56:59.953
was when he found out
he was dying last week.

56:59.986 --> 57:02.255
- No, but he...
- He is full of shit.

57:02.288 --> 57:03.790
He says you've been
keeping him away from JJ

57:03.823 --> 57:05.225
because of the accident.

57:05.258 --> 57:07.593
And he swears he wasn't drunk
that night.

57:09.062 --> 57:10.964
I never said he was.

57:10.997 --> 57:12.932
And it wasn't an accident.

57:12.966 --> 57:15.001
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

57:15.035 --> 57:15.835
No, but it was wet.

57:15.869 --> 57:17.804
He said it was wet
and he slipped.

57:17.837 --> 57:21.941
He deliberately drove that car
into the tree.

57:21.975 --> 57:23.343
How do you know that for sure?
You can't...

57:23.376 --> 57:26.246
Are you fuckin' serious?

57:26.279 --> 57:28.281
I mean, what if you're wrong,
Pattie?

57:28.314 --> 57:30.016
Does he deserve that?
Does Joey deserve that?

57:30.050 --> 57:31.151
"Say I won't."

57:35.288 --> 57:36.656
What?

57:36.689 --> 57:38.958
That's what he kept
saying to me.

57:38.992 --> 57:40.827
He was so pissed
that I was leaving him.

57:40.860 --> 57:42.862
He was pissed
that JJ was crying.

57:42.896 --> 57:45.865
He was driving like a lunatic
on The Jamaicaway.

57:45.899 --> 57:47.167
I tried to plead with him.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.135
I was begging him to stop,

57:49.169 --> 57:50.837
but he just kept pointing
at the trees and screaming,

57:50.870 --> 57:53.873
"Say I won't!
Say I won't!"

57:53.907 --> 57:56.242
And I looked at him and I said,
"I know you won't."

57:59.045 --> 58:01.181
And then I went through
the windshield.

58:11.057 --> 58:12.358
"Say I won't"?

58:25.371 --> 58:28.208
Can't believe
I went there for you.

58:28.241 --> 58:30.110
Like a fuckin' asshole.

58:31.444 --> 58:32.412
After what you did to them,

58:32.445 --> 58:34.147
you're lucky you're not dying
in prison.

58:34.180 --> 58:35.982
You know that?

58:39.219 --> 58:41.988
I just wanna see my son.

58:42.021 --> 58:42.989
Yeah, but you knew
there was no way

58:43.022 --> 58:45.125
she was gonna let you see him.

58:45.158 --> 58:46.759
Right?

58:46.793 --> 58:48.895
She already told JJ
you were dead.

58:54.400 --> 58:56.669
You didn't know.

58:58.037 --> 58:59.739
I'm sorry.

59:02.142 --> 59:04.077
I can't help you.
I can't help you.

59:04.110 --> 59:05.778
So you're just gonna leave, hm?

59:05.812 --> 59:09.382
What the fuck
am I even doing here, Joey?

59:09.415 --> 59:10.817
Huh?

59:16.890 --> 59:18.791
You never visited me.

59:23.429 --> 59:25.031
In juvie.

59:28.134 --> 59:30.436
Not even a letter.

59:31.404 --> 59:34.207
You just disappeared.

59:34.240 --> 59:36.075
I was a kid, Joey.

59:39.445 --> 59:41.781
We were just kids.

01:00:56.889 --> 01:00:58.124
- What?
- Hey, Denise.

01:00:58.157 --> 01:00:59.859
I was just thinking about you.

01:00:59.892 --> 01:01:00.860
Wow.

01:01:00.893 --> 01:01:01.995
You're wasted.

01:01:02.028 --> 01:01:04.030
You gonna be all right tomorrow?

01:01:04.063 --> 01:01:07.100
I'm gonna be fuckin' perfect.

01:01:07.133 --> 01:01:09.235
I'm driving back first thing.

01:01:09.269 --> 01:01:10.069
You read my text?

01:01:10.103 --> 01:01:11.304
Mitchell's been
in Richard's ear

01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:13.539
the whole time
you were gone.

01:01:13.573 --> 01:01:15.041
Oh, fuck that clown.

01:01:15.074 --> 01:01:16.943
No. Richard had him
get those financials

01:01:16.976 --> 01:01:18.578
- you dropped the ball on.
- I fucking got 'em.

01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:19.579
No, you don't get it.

01:01:19.613 --> 01:01:21.948
Mitchell got them first
and you weren't here.

01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:23.483
You know what?

01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:25.885
I'm lead, so tell 'em both
they can suck my dick.

01:01:25.918 --> 01:01:28.087
How 'bout... how 'bout that?

01:01:28.121 --> 01:01:29.922
I think it's time
to hang up now.

01:01:29.956 --> 01:01:31.924
No, Denise.

01:01:31.958 --> 01:01:32.925
Stop.

01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:33.926
I'm sorry.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.595
Just... no. Just...

01:01:35.629 --> 01:01:37.830
You picked a shitty time
to take a vacation.

01:01:37.864 --> 01:01:39.132
I'm done.

01:01:39.165 --> 01:01:40.566
Denise, I got this, okay?

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.837
Don't fuckin', like,
bail on me, okay?

01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:46.439
Denise.

01:01:46.472 --> 01:01:48.107
Denise!

01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:58.217
Fuck!

01:02:08.027 --> 01:02:10.129
- The fuck outta here.
- What're you doing?

01:02:10.163 --> 01:02:11.564
What, are you gonna go home
and cry to your mommy, huh?

01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:13.333
I'll fuckin' kill you,
I swear to God!

01:02:37.156 --> 01:02:39.025
No, he won't even know
it's gone.

01:03:09.956 --> 01:03:12.258
- Kill you, I swear to God!
- No!

01:03:12.291 --> 01:03:13.593
Joey, come on!

01:03:17.631 --> 01:03:19.165
Fuck it.

01:03:19.198 --> 01:03:20.533
I'm gonna go see
if Pattie's home.

01:03:20.566 --> 01:03:22.335
Hell ya, Russo.

01:03:29.575 --> 01:03:32.646
You steal my bottle,
you little prick?

01:03:32.679 --> 01:03:34.013
Huh?

01:03:34.046 --> 01:03:35.381
Answer me.

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:38.418
What'd I tell you
about hangin' out

01:03:38.451 --> 01:03:40.553
with that fuckin' half breed,
huh?

01:03:40.586 --> 01:03:43.657
Get your shit and let's go home.

01:03:52.131 --> 01:03:54.400
I said, get your shit.
We're going home.

01:03:56.369 --> 01:03:59.405
Oh, you think you're
a big man now, little fairy?

01:03:59.439 --> 01:04:01.240
Hm?

01:04:01.274 --> 01:04:04.444
You think I won't knock you
on your ass right here?

01:04:04.477 --> 01:04:08.080
Say I won't.

01:04:08.114 --> 01:04:09.081
No!

01:04:11.484 --> 01:04:12.452
Fuckin' monkey.

01:04:19.225 --> 01:04:20.426
Fuck off.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.228
Fuck. Yeah.

01:04:32.606 --> 01:04:34.307
Oh, shit.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.677
Oh, fuckin' shit.

01:04:37.744 --> 01:04:39.545
Fuckin'.

01:04:39.579 --> 01:04:41.314
Fuck.

01:04:43.416 --> 01:04:44.450
Your call
has been forwarded...

01:04:44.484 --> 01:04:45.652
- Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
- to an automated

01:04:45.686 --> 01:04:47.253
voice messaging system.

01:04:47.286 --> 01:04:49.656
At the tone,
please record your message.

01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:52.592
Denise. Denise, tell Richard
I'm on my way, okay?

01:04:52.626 --> 01:04:54.560
I got this. All right?

01:04:55.796 --> 01:04:57.029
Oh, shit.

01:05:02.201 --> 01:05:03.637
- Denise!
- Your call has been forwarded...

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:04.671
Fuck.

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.618
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

01:06:02.629 --> 01:06:04.397
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:05.832
Fuck!

01:06:23.249 --> 01:06:24.517
Fuck!

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:27.186
Fuck!

01:06:40.433 --> 01:06:42.335
- Dude, your eye.
- Cry to your mommy, huh?

01:06:42.368 --> 01:06:43.469
Can't believe
you're moving tomorrow.

01:06:43.502 --> 01:06:45.204
- Here ya go, Russo!
- Russo.

01:06:45.237 --> 01:06:46.138
- That's the way you play.
- You think he passed out yet?

01:06:46.172 --> 01:06:47.206
Why are you goin' to that
fuckin'...

01:06:47.239 --> 01:06:48.207
Answer me.

01:06:50.543 --> 01:06:52.144
You gonna cry now?

01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:54.648
Go home to your mama.

01:07:00.721 --> 01:07:02.856
Stop it!
You're gonna kill him!

01:07:25.578 --> 01:07:27.814
Get outta here.
I got this.

01:07:30.884 --> 01:07:32.284
The fuck outta here.

01:07:32.318 --> 01:07:34.387
Can't just leave you.

01:07:40.794 --> 01:07:42.696
What're you doing?

01:07:42.729 --> 01:07:44.530
Fuckin' kill ya,
I swear to God!

01:07:44.563 --> 01:07:45.866
Joey, come on!

01:07:45.899 --> 01:07:47.199
Go!

01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:53.406
Fuck you.
Fuck you!

01:07:53.439 --> 01:07:55.207
Fuck you!

01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:56.409
Fuck you!

01:08:25.304 --> 01:08:26.606
Russo.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.544
Fuck, good to see you
these last few days.

01:08:35.346 --> 01:08:36.850
Sorry I lied.

01:08:38.952 --> 01:08:40.854
You're a good friend.

01:08:40.886 --> 01:08:43.622
You always were.

01:08:43.657 --> 01:08:45.524
I want you to know...

01:08:45.558 --> 01:08:47.560
My ol' man...

01:08:47.593 --> 01:08:49.395
I never told nobody.

01:08:51.363 --> 01:08:53.767
And I never blamed you.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.770
Never.

01:08:56.803 --> 01:09:01.942
And Pattie and JJ,

01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:04.877
I know, I fucked up.

01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:09.314
Can you just tell 'em,
tell 'em I'm sorry?

01:09:13.086 --> 01:09:15.020
You don't owe me nothin'

01:09:15.055 --> 01:09:19.760
but maybe you could help
the kid, hm?

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:22.028
Play catch with him, something?

01:12:06.558 --> 01:12:09.763
Hi. This is Pattie.
Leave a message.

01:12:09.796 --> 01:12:10.864
Hey, Pattie.

01:12:10.897 --> 01:12:12.732
It's Ronnie again.

01:12:49.135 --> 01:12:50.469
Okay.

01:12:52.639 --> 01:12:55.175
- Get ready.
- I'm ready.

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:57.110
I hope you're ready.

01:12:58.712 --> 01:12:59.846
Oh.

01:13:08.054 --> 01:13:09.189
Mom, this is her.

01:13:09.222 --> 01:13:10.657
Do you mind if I take it?

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:11.791
No. Go ahead.

01:13:11.825 --> 01:13:12.892
Okay.

01:13:16.595 --> 01:13:17.731
Hey.

01:13:24.137 --> 01:13:25.638
Hey, honey,
can you wait here a minute?

01:13:25.672 --> 01:13:27.173
Okay.

01:13:35.315 --> 01:13:37.984
Hey look, Pattie, I...

01:13:38.018 --> 01:13:39.185
I am so, so sorry.

01:13:41.654 --> 01:13:43.056
I should've been straight
with you from the beginning

01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:46.026
and I wasn't.

01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:48.695
And I had absolutely no right

01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:50.730
to decide what's best
for your son.

01:13:54.968 --> 01:13:56.568
Thank you.

01:13:59.105 --> 01:14:00.539
Your note...

01:14:01.975 --> 01:14:04.010
I can't believe
Joey never told me.

01:14:05.645 --> 01:14:07.847
No kid should ever have to...

01:14:12.252 --> 01:14:14.621
So you doing okay?

01:14:14.654 --> 01:14:15.789
Yeah.

01:14:18.691 --> 01:14:20.060
Much better, actually.

01:14:21.194 --> 01:14:23.363
JJ doesn't know yet.

01:14:23.396 --> 01:14:25.999
I'm going to tell him.
I just have to figure out how.

01:14:26.032 --> 01:14:29.601
Look, I promise
I won't say a word.

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:30.737
I thought
it would be easier on him,

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:32.906
but it just made it worse.

01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:34.741
I didn't wanna deal
with my own shit.

01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:38.611
I get that.

01:14:40.146 --> 01:14:43.049
Well, I'm dealing
with it now, so.

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:44.784
Yeah, me too.

01:14:46.886 --> 01:14:48.388
Really?

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:50.123
I mean, it hasn't been easy,

01:14:50.156 --> 01:14:53.993
But... I'm making progress.

01:14:56.029 --> 01:14:57.197
I told JJ
that you and his dad

01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:59.699
used to be best friends
when you were kids.

01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:03.870
Yeah?

01:15:03.903 --> 01:15:05.338
What'd he say?

01:15:05.371 --> 01:15:07.373
He wanted to call you
right away.

01:15:07.407 --> 01:15:10.176
Then he was mad at me because
I didn't tell him sooner.

01:15:12.045 --> 01:15:14.914
Just told him I didn't think
he was ready, you know?

01:15:14.948 --> 01:15:16.182
Makes sense.

01:15:20.753 --> 01:15:22.655
So I was hoping
maybe you could tell JJ

01:15:22.689 --> 01:15:24.124
a few stories
about you and his dad

01:15:24.157 --> 01:15:25.892
from when you were kids.

01:15:29.696 --> 01:15:31.030
I can do that.

01:15:32.132 --> 01:15:34.067
Don't sugarcoat it.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.702
I don't think
that's possible, really.

01:15:35.735 --> 01:15:37.303
Right. That's very true.

01:15:39.772 --> 01:15:40.907
Okay.

01:15:42.175 --> 01:15:44.711
I, um,

01:15:44.744 --> 01:15:48.915
I brought some of his things,
if you wanna look through 'em.

01:15:48.948 --> 01:15:50.216
Yeah.

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.318
Thank you.

01:15:52.352 --> 01:15:54.687
Hey.

01:15:54.721 --> 01:15:57.957
You are a fuckin' awesome
mother, Pattie Barry.

01:15:57.991 --> 01:15:59.292
I know.

01:16:01.027 --> 01:16:02.362
Hey, JJ!

01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:12.138
You, uh, you know,

01:16:12.172 --> 01:16:14.707
your dad almost threw
a perfect game with this ball.

01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:17.010
Get outta here.

01:16:17.043 --> 01:16:19.712
Yeah, he was just two outs away.

01:16:19.746 --> 01:16:21.247
Oh, man.

01:16:21.281 --> 01:16:23.883
Must've been so bummed.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:25.118
Eh.

01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:26.719
He was actually okay with it.

01:17:12.818 --> 01:17:15.114
