WEBVTT

00:28.792 --> 00:30.083
Are we going to
that party tonight?

00:30.166 --> 00:31.750
- Yeah.
- Man, forget about the
party.

00:31.834 --> 00:34.166
Just keep driving
right out of Philly.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.500
What's wrong with Philly?

00:35.583 --> 00:39.625
- May's got her big plans.
- Singing, huh?

00:39.709 --> 00:42.333
She's gonna cut some plates
of her own in New York City.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.583
Why do you want
to go to New York?

00:45.667 --> 00:47.166
You don't know anyone there.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.875
I know everyone here.

00:48.959 --> 00:51.625
I bet she makes it, we won't
hear from her ever again

00:51.709 --> 00:53.875
except for on the radio.

00:53.959 --> 00:56.792
My daddy says, you plan big,
you'll just disappoint
yourself.

00:56.875 --> 00:59.959
Yeah, well, I got
plans
that involve you.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.291
Me, too.
With you.

01:02.375 --> 01:05.792
Aw, crap!
Get a room.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.500
So this chick went AWOL

02:49.583 --> 02:51.333
after a highway
shooting in '88?

02:51.417 --> 02:53.417
The guy she was with
was killed.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.917
She got winged.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.375
Skipped out of the hospital
before cops could interview
her.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.041
And now someone
dropped the dime?

02:59.125 --> 03:01.834
An old classmate saw her
on the boardwalk last
week.

03:04.458 --> 03:05.834
Now, what is that?

03:08.208 --> 03:09.834
Rice cake.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.250
Alright.

03:17.083 --> 03:19.417
- May Pierson.
- Yeah.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.750
Philadelphia Homicide.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.041
I don't have anything
to do with anything.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.125
That's a
pretty
broad claim.

03:25.208 --> 03:27.500
I've been up all night.
I can't be doing this.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.458
Doing what, May? You don't even
know what its about.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.792
Or do you?

03:30.875 --> 03:32.875
Clem Garris, shot on
the expressway in '88.

03:32.959 --> 03:34.875
- You were there.
- Till you fled.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.583
No. That was another girl.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.166
(Vera)
'So you're not May Pierson?'

03:44.250 --> 03:45.834
(Vera)
'That works at this
fine establishment.'

03:45.917 --> 03:48.417
And drives this vehicle?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.625
I'm saying that
was a lifetime ago.

03:50.709 --> 03:53.291
- And we gotta talk about it.
- Forget it. I'm going home.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.417
This ain't a debate, May.
We got a warrant.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.291
We do this here
or we do it in Philly.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.333
You can't take me there.
On what basis?

03:59.417 --> 04:01.667
Obstructing a police
investigation, '88.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.083
New York bench warrant, '94.

04:03.166 --> 04:06.542
And irritating
two Homicide guys,
2006.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.000
Get in the car.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.041
Were you in court
this morning?

05:01.125 --> 05:03.500
Huh, cat emergency.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.792
Olivia got chomped
by a neighbor dog.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.667
Did he get
the other eye?

05:07.750 --> 05:09.041
It's not funny.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.834
Rita.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.709
Hi, John.

05:20.792 --> 05:24.125
I almost came by.
I didn't want to bother you.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.417
Er, Lilly Rush.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.583
Rita...Hart.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.166
Formerly, Stillman.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.333
Oh, uh, hi.

05:32.417 --> 05:35.375
Um, I'll see you
in there, boss.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.959
So, uh, what
brings you here?

05:40.041 --> 05:42.041
House got robbed last night.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.208
No kidding.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.583
Yeah. I just reported it.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.083
Was Joe with you?

05:47.166 --> 05:52.542
Joe moved out.
A few months ago.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.458
- The drinking?
- Yeah.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.083
- Sorry.
- It's better.

05:59.166 --> 06:02.917
I'll talk to Major Crimes,
have them fast-track it.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.208
Okay.

06:05.291 --> 06:07.500
- Give you a call.
- Thanks.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.291
Clem Garris, shot
and killed, January '88.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.667
- Found on the shoulder of
I-76.
- But not alone.

06:24.750 --> 06:25.875
No, that's the scandalous part.

06:25.959 --> 06:28.458
He was found with a woman,
not his wife.

06:28.542 --> 06:31.375
May Pierson.
Was shot in the arm.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.709
Slipped out of the ER

06:32.792 --> 06:34.291
before the cops could
get a play-by-play.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.792
But Vera and Valens
picked her up this morning.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.291
Got her upstairs.

06:37.375 --> 06:39.625
Leaves the scene and
doesn't turn up for 18 years.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.125
- That's a person of
interest.
- At least.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.208
But Clem told his wife,
Sally,
he'd be at a local bar

06:44.291 --> 06:45.709
that night,
with the
guys.

06:45.792 --> 06:49.542
So why's he out on
the highway with this gal?

06:49.625 --> 06:52.625
Rough way to find out
what your husband's up to.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.625
Unless Sally already knew.

06:54.709 --> 06:56.375
Decided she'd had enough.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.834
Making her person of interest
number two.

06:59.917 --> 07:01.333
Between New York and Jersey..

07:01.417 --> 07:02.667
...there's a lot of ink
on you, May.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.000
That's from way back.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.792
DUI. Arrests for loitering.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.125
- Solicitation.
- I know what I did.

07:09.208 --> 07:11.000
Now you know why I ditched
the cops that night.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.583
You didn't want
to get jammed up.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.667
Never mind helping find
who killed your boyfriend,
Clem.

07:14.750 --> 07:15.875
He wasn't my boyfriend.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.333
You're saying
you weren't screwing
around?

07:17.417 --> 07:18.709
I hadn't seen him in years.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.041
Well, then, how the heck
do you end up

07:20.125 --> 07:22.041
on that highway
with him, May?

07:25.291 --> 07:28.000
I ran into Clem
in Atlantic City that
night.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.750
Told his wife
he was at a Philly bar.

07:29.834 --> 07:31.208
I can't account for that.

07:31.291 --> 07:34.667
So, you run into him..

07:34.750 --> 07:36.166
We're talking about old times.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.208
We're both heading back
to Philly. He offers me a
ride.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.792
And?

07:40.875 --> 07:42.875
And we're almost there.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.917
Get bumped from behind.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.667
He pulls over, gets out..

07:52.458 --> 07:55.667
Gets shot.
Just like that.

07:55.750 --> 07:59.041
Clem talk about being
in trouble, anything like
that?

07:59.125 --> 08:00.709
I don't know
what his life was like.

08:00.792 --> 08:03.500
We'd said our goodbyes years
earlier when we were just
kids.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.625
May Pierson shows up.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.250
Worked one last shift.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.667
You really going, huh?

08:33.750 --> 08:36.000
Philly to New York, 8:00 a.m.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.166
Not gonna wait for Petey
to come get you?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.458
Petey's a big
college football star.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.959
He's never coming back.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.583
You gonna marry Sally?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.709
That's the plan.

09:07.709 --> 09:12.208
What if you came
with me, instead?

09:12.291 --> 09:14.458
Come with you?

09:14.542 --> 09:16.291
Remember that day we ditched?

09:16.375 --> 09:18.792
Drove around, playing "Born To
Run" till the tape broke?

09:18.875 --> 09:22.458
Yeah. We ran out of gas.

09:22.542 --> 09:25.083
We could spend
every day like that.

09:27.709 --> 09:30.041
I'm not like you, May.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.792
I'm not a big
dream
kind of person.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.875
But you are.

09:37.959 --> 09:40.500
I gotta stay.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.792
Well, she sure is pretty.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.333
Bye, Mayflower.

10:24.500 --> 10:28.208
That's how I like
to remember Clem.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.834
'Cause when I saw him
that night in Atlantic City

10:30.917 --> 10:33.375
he'd turned into just another..

10:33.458 --> 10:37.083
...disappointed working guy.

10:37.166 --> 10:40.041
It happens.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.208
That's what I know.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.917
Now, can I get back to Jersey?

10:52.458 --> 10:54.375
So May Pierson
gave us new
details.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.959
- About your husband's murder.
- Like?

10:57.041 --> 10:58.792
He was in Atlantic
City
that night.

10:58.875 --> 11:02.500
Not in Philly,
like he told
you.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.709
Look, I know everyone thought..

11:04.792 --> 11:06.709
...Clem must've been
seeing her behind my back.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.083
But he wasn't.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.125
- How do you know?
- Clem wasn't perfect.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.458
But he was more good than bad.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.250
And when he was in
something...he was in.

11:17.166 --> 11:20.917
When I was 19,
I took off with a
guy

11:21.000 --> 11:22.542
two weeks into knowing him.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.458
The heart wants what it wants.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.458
Yeah, he was a biker.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.125
A drinker.
But I
thought

11:28.208 --> 11:29.709
"This is it."

11:29.792 --> 11:33.750
"Roll out the carpet.
We're going down the aisle."

11:33.834 --> 11:36.291
And you didn't go
through with it?

11:36.375 --> 11:40.625
Kinda came close.
We were road
tripping.

11:40.709 --> 11:43.500
Went to a
courthouse
in Knoxville, but,
uh..

11:43.583 --> 11:47.625
...we just sat
out there on his
bike.

11:47.709 --> 11:50.375
Neither one of
us
could get off.

11:52.208 --> 11:54.875
Well, Clem and I
never had any doubts.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.291
No?

11:56.375 --> 12:01.125
Getting married was
the happiest day of our
lives.

12:01.208 --> 12:03.333
Anyone unhappy that day?

12:05.542 --> 12:07.667
One person.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.834
- Are you sorry?
- No. Come on.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.250
I didn't want this
to be the way.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.458
We were going to
have babies,
anyway.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.667
We're doing
the right thing,
Sal.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.208
I'm going to make
you
happy every day.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.625
What a freakin' joke.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.875
Petey, we didn't think
you were coming.

12:59.959 --> 13:03.667
You two aren't fooling anyone.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.667
Ah, you drinking
this early?

13:05.750 --> 13:07.500
You're just marrying her
because she's knocked up, okay?

13:07.583 --> 13:09.542
- And everyone knows it.
- Keep it down.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.000
Pete, you're acting
real embarrassing--

13:11.083 --> 13:13.208
Oh, oh, I'm embarrassing, huh?

13:13.291 --> 13:16.125
I know who you
really
want to be with.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.792
It's my girl. May.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.291
- No.
- What the hell happened to
you?

13:30.583 --> 13:32.542
Well, what-what happened?

13:32.625 --> 13:35.250
I-I got my ass kicked
out
and I'm washed up and

13:35.333 --> 13:38.250
my girl's long gone. So you
get
everything and I get nothing.

13:40.458 --> 13:41.959
Start up my car.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.959
Me and my bride are
pulling out of here.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.583
(Rush)
'Petey hit some kind of
wall?'

14:18.667 --> 14:21.166
Something went real wrong
at Penn State.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.709
And he dropped out.
Came home damaged goods.

14:23.792 --> 14:27.291
Brought some strong
feelings home with
him.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.583
If it's true Clem was
in Atlantic City that
night..

14:30.667 --> 14:31.750
Yeah?

14:31.834 --> 14:34.166
Petey spent a lot
of time there.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.542
So he could've run into
Clem
and May and reacted badly.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.834
I can't put it past him.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.333
He's in jail now.

14:48.834 --> 14:51.834
Made a spectacle of
yourself
at that wedding, Petey.

14:51.917 --> 14:55.083
Yeah, what a jerk.

14:55.166 --> 14:58.375
Pretty bitter about
things
going so good for
Clem?

14:58.458 --> 15:01.333
I was in a real bad way then.

15:01.417 --> 15:04.625
I'd just lost
my free ride to Penn State.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.291
I played ball, too.

15:06.375 --> 15:07.750
Yeah?

15:07.834 --> 15:09.458
What went wrong?

15:09.542 --> 15:11.583
First game, I choked.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.333
Froze up on the field,
did it all year.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.875
- Got cut.
- Oh.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.792
Couldn't have been easy
coming home after that.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.000
It wasn't.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.041
People look at you
like you're crap.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.125
- Including Clem?
- No.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.542
He was cool.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.291
I apologized
for the wedding thing.

15:29.375 --> 15:30.625
We moved on.

15:30.709 --> 15:32.667
Started hanging out again.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.125
Were you surprised
to hear that he was

15:34.208 --> 15:35.959
with May
the night he
died?

15:36.041 --> 15:37.250
Yeah.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.667
Everyone was.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.000
- Bother you at all?
- How do you mean?

15:41.083 --> 15:44.125
She was your old girl, right?

15:44.208 --> 15:46.500
I went with her in high school.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.667
So maybe you wanted
to get back to that
time

15:48.750 --> 15:50.375
when you were a football star

15:50.458 --> 15:53.500
and had your girl, May.

15:53.583 --> 15:57.083
Not denying those
were better times but

15:57.166 --> 16:00.083
eight years later,
I wasn't thinking about May.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.333
No?

16:01.417 --> 16:03.583
I was thinking about
someone else.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.583
Nine seconds left and Crazy
Rich
tosses me that screen pass.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.041
Yeah, I, I remember.
Me and Sal were on the field

16:32.125 --> 16:34.375
getting ready to do
the homecoming thing.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.208
Caught that baby,
turned on the
jets.

16:36.291 --> 16:39.458
- That was something.
- Crazy times. Crazy times.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.083
Never been a prettier
homecoming queen, Sal.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.917
You in that white dress.

16:47.709 --> 16:48.917
You remember that, huh?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.417
Are you kidding me?
Everybody noticed.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.542
Clem got the best
catch in school.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.542
I sure did.

17:04.041 --> 17:05.250
Who's that?

17:05.333 --> 17:07.291
A guy, I do favors for,
make some cash.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.625
I better get back to the baby.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.542
Well, I'll be home soon.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.583
Why's she so down?

17:20.667 --> 17:23.458
Er..

17:23.542 --> 17:24.917
...things been
kind of iffy at home.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.000
You know, truthfully, man..

17:33.583 --> 17:38.166
...I don't know if me and Sal
were ready for all this.

17:38.250 --> 17:39.709
So young..

17:41.875 --> 17:43.625
It's probably just
tough times right now.

17:43.709 --> 17:45.500
Yeah.

17:45.583 --> 17:48.458
No, man.

17:48.542 --> 17:50.041
It is more than that.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.792
You think she's sorry?

17:51.875 --> 17:56.125
I think she wishes
she didn't cry every night.

18:00.542 --> 18:03.166
So Clem and Sally
were on the outs.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.375
Win or lose..

18:08.458 --> 18:10.417
I'll lay it out for you.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.291
Things between..

18:15.417 --> 18:17.375
...me and Sally..

18:17.458 --> 18:19.417
...kind of grew.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.166
(Stillman)
'So Sally and Petey started
up.'

18:26.250 --> 18:28.166
It kind of kills her claim
her marriage was so great.

18:28.250 --> 18:31.500
And gives her motive
if she wanted out for good.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.750
What were these favors that
Petey was doing for money?

18:33.834 --> 18:35.125
Breaking legs, stealing cars.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.250
- Thug stuff.
- Clem ever get in on it?

18:37.333 --> 18:39.417
Petey says he offered
but Clem wouldn't go for it.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.834
Guy walked the line.

18:42.291 --> 18:44.875
Uh, anyway, guys..

18:44.959 --> 18:46.250
...night.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.500
What's he
nervous about?

18:52.208 --> 18:53.333
Her.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.542
So they found who
did
the robberies?

18:57.625 --> 19:00.166
Yeah, Bobby Greene.

19:00.250 --> 19:03.750
Lived up the street. He used to
throw mud balls at our windows.

19:03.834 --> 19:05.083
That little kid?

19:05.166 --> 19:06.417
He's grown up.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.709
Criminal now.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.250
Oh, God.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.458
He hit two other houses
on the block but

19:11.542 --> 19:13.000
he got picked up this morning.

19:14.041 --> 19:15.792
That's sad.

19:18.792 --> 19:22.583
So why didn't you come to me
about this in the first place?

19:24.583 --> 19:25.959
I knew you'd be busy.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.875
Well, I'm trying to be
less busy.

19:29.959 --> 19:32.625
You are who you are.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.625
I would like to think
I've learned some things.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.500
- Anyway, I--
- Would you..

19:44.917 --> 19:46.333
Ever want to have dinner?

19:47.834 --> 19:49.750
Go to Irina's?

19:49.834 --> 19:51.083
Really?

19:52.166 --> 19:54.291
Yeah. I'm free Friday.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.000
- Me, too.
- Seven?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.250
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.333
- Alright, I'll see you.
- Okay.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.166
- Seven.
- Yeah.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.834
Clem made you happy every day.

20:28.917 --> 20:30.417
- Right, Sally?
- Right.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.917
Don't want to revise
that statement?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.166
Why would I?

20:33.250 --> 20:34.750
How about because
you were banging Petey?

20:36.709 --> 20:37.875
That was wrong.

20:37.959 --> 20:39.291
But it happened.

20:39.375 --> 20:42.625
And you not telling that,
gets our wheels turning.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.625
Maybe you felt trapped.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.500
Well, things between
you and Clem died out

20:46.583 --> 20:47.959
but he wouldn't give up.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.959
'Cause when he was in
something, he was in.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.041
Look..

20:53.125 --> 20:55.375
...I never had that
kind of love again.

20:55.458 --> 20:57.917
So maybe, I want to remember
things a certain way.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.917
(Valens)
'But we don't live
in that land, Sal.'

21:00.000 --> 21:01.709
We got a
real-life
murder to solve.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.417
That's true.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.667
- Things faded.
- And?

21:09.750 --> 21:11.792
And it's true Clem
wasn't one to give up.

21:12.959 --> 21:15.333
But he did...finally.

21:53.709 --> 21:54.917
(Clem)
'Oh, man, it's..'

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Valentine's Day.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.583
Baby, I'm sorry.

21:59.667 --> 22:02.834
I was gonna get flowers
and candy..

22:02.917 --> 22:04.291
It doesn't matter.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.709
Let's go to bed, huh?

22:25.208 --> 22:26.250
No.

22:32.917 --> 22:35.250
We ain't making it,
are we, Sal?

22:40.667 --> 22:43.125
Why can't we fix it?

22:43.208 --> 22:44.458
I don't know.

22:47.375 --> 22:48.875
It's just gone.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.333
But it was right.

22:53.834 --> 22:56.291
It was fun and easy and right.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.250
It was.

23:01.583 --> 23:03.417
I don't wanna
be a divorced person.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.125
Yeah, but do you want to be..

23:07.625 --> 23:09.500
...this married person?

23:36.250 --> 23:38.667
That's when Petey
came into the
picture?

23:41.750 --> 23:44.125
It wasn't love.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.834
But he wanted to be with me.

23:46.917 --> 23:48.834
And Clem wanted
to be somewhere else.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.125
By the time
May came back to town..

23:53.500 --> 23:54.875
...he knew he could
go see her.

23:56.417 --> 23:58.709
And May came back?

24:03.417 --> 24:07.041
When her mother died,
I went to the funeral.

24:10.834 --> 24:13.625
I told you, I haven't
seen Clem since high
school.

24:14.542 --> 24:15.875
Oh, I know what
you told me.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.667
His wife says he
was
at the funeral.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.000
[sighs]
Look, I didn't kill him.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.500
Then why lie
to my face?

24:27.166 --> 24:28.542
What are you hiding?

24:34.333 --> 24:37.458
Me and Clem did a stupid,
desperate thing.

24:37.542 --> 24:40.125
Tried to get back something
we could never have again.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.709
I need to hear about that.

24:49.458 --> 24:51.583
I saw him at the funeral.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.667
And?

24:56.625 --> 24:58.959
Everything rushed back.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.500
Clem Garris shows up.

26:21.792 --> 26:23.875
Hey, Mayflower.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.000
I should get to the reception.

26:46.083 --> 26:48.208
Hmm. Let me drive you.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.125
How did New York go?

27:35.458 --> 27:36.792
Not too good.

27:37.834 --> 27:39.667
How is that possible?

27:39.750 --> 27:41.500
You're the best
singer
I ever heard.

27:42.709 --> 27:44.500
Turns out a lot
of people can sing.

27:56.834 --> 28:01.083
You wanna go to that reception?

28:01.166 --> 28:02.709
No.

28:02.792 --> 28:03.750
Just keep driving.

28:13.834 --> 28:16.959
(Clem)
'You got a guy there
in New York?'

28:17.041 --> 28:19.750
(May)
'No. Mostly, I just got
debts.'

28:19.834 --> 28:21.375
(Clem)
'How you been getting by?'

28:21.458 --> 28:24.083
I don't wanna
talk about it.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.208
Okay.

28:26.667 --> 28:28.333
I just haven't
been living right.

28:49.333 --> 28:50.875
What if we
started
over?

28:52.417 --> 28:53.792
You and me?

28:56.375 --> 28:57.291
How?

28:57.375 --> 28:59.417
Get out of here.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.792
Just drive away.

29:01.875 --> 29:04.291
Like we should
have
done years ago.

29:08.041 --> 29:10.125
I loved you so much.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.542
Maybe it's still
in you someplace.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.500
I know it's in me.

29:18.458 --> 29:19.834
I owe this guy--

29:19.917 --> 29:23.291
There's a job I can
do
in Atlantic City.

29:23.375 --> 29:24.667
Get you money.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.583
And then clear out of here?

29:30.667 --> 29:34.000
Yeah, you and me.
Finally.

30:06.583 --> 30:07.834
We thought we could pick up

30:07.917 --> 30:10.041
where we left things
all those years ago.

30:11.625 --> 30:14.208
But you can't go back.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.750
Learned that the hard way.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.709
So then you met
in Atlantic City?

30:19.792 --> 30:22.291
He did this job and we went.

30:23.792 --> 30:25.875
Then the shooting happened.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.166
What kind of job?

30:27.250 --> 30:30.333
He just said
it was a favor for a guy.

30:31.792 --> 30:34.667
Looked into the dude Petey
was doing those favors for.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.834
A low life named Henry Mack.

30:36.917 --> 30:38.583
Probably who Clem
got mixed up with.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.208
What's this Mack's line of work?

30:40.291 --> 30:43.125
He had a ring of guys stealing
cars at airports, casinos.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.625
Bringing them back
to his chop shop in Philly.

30:45.709 --> 30:48.291
So maybe Clem's doing some runs
for him that night.

30:48.375 --> 30:51.583
And maybe Petey knows more about
that night than he's letting on.

30:51.667 --> 30:52.875
Hey, you find this Mack?

30:52.959 --> 30:55.250
Yeah, six feet under in Trenton.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.750
- Tough interview.
- But there's a story to
that.

30:57.834 --> 31:00.583
The guy was murdered.
Shot in a casino parking lot.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.166
That connected
to Clem somehow?

31:02.250 --> 31:04.291
I'm guessing,
'cause Mack was killed

31:04.375 --> 31:05.959
the very same night Clem was.

31:13.834 --> 31:15.333
I know Clem
usually
walked the line.

31:15.417 --> 31:17.667
Didn't get mixed up
with
the kind of favors you
did.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.333
He kept his nose clean.

31:19.417 --> 31:21.542
Except maybe
just one time

31:21.625 --> 31:23.625
when he really
needed the money?

31:23.709 --> 31:26.208
- For May?
- Maybe.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.542
But that one time
you two worked for Mack

31:28.625 --> 31:29.917
Clem gets shot.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.625
- So does Mack.
- Uh-huh.

31:31.709 --> 31:34.875
It's kind of hard to miss what
those murders have in common.

31:34.959 --> 31:37.250
- 'You.'
- I was a thief, not a
killer.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.083
You and Clem were
stealing those cars

31:39.166 --> 31:41.125
maybe get ambitious?

31:41.208 --> 31:42.500
Decide to double-cross Mack?

31:42.583 --> 31:44.000
- No.
- But Clem was desperate.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.959
Maybe having a running buddy
made you bold.

31:46.041 --> 31:47.959
And Henry Mack probably
deserved a pop in the
head.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.125
I don't know how Mack died.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.250
Then, after you two
waste him

31:51.333 --> 31:53.625
you panic, worried Clem's
gonna fold.

31:53.709 --> 31:54.792
'Cause he don't got
a criminal nature.

31:54.875 --> 31:55.834
He walks the line.

31:55.917 --> 31:57.834
Clem was the one guy
who was nice

31:57.917 --> 31:59.834
to me when
I came home a mess.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.458
Everyone else
kept away.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.583
He stayed my friend.

32:12.417 --> 32:14.750
So be a friend to him, Petey.

32:14.834 --> 32:17.333
You say what happened
that night.

32:20.542 --> 32:23.750
He didn't wanna be dirty.

32:23.834 --> 32:26.667
But it was
his only ticket out.

34:42.667 --> 34:44.291
[sighs]
I'm out, Petey.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.458
No, you want to get
paid,
we got to go to Philly.

34:48.291 --> 34:49.667
I'm taking the car.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.667
- What?
- Forget the money.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.208
Well,
that-that's
no good, Clem.

34:53.291 --> 34:54.417
Mack won't go for that.

34:54.500 --> 34:58.750
Mack's not gonna find me.
Be good to her.

35:17.667 --> 35:20.542
He went off to get May.

35:20.625 --> 35:23.333
That's it.

35:23.417 --> 35:26.333
The '69 Chevy, huh?

35:27.792 --> 35:30.709
It was a beauty.

35:30.792 --> 35:31.875
Yeah.

35:33.208 --> 35:34.458
I've seen it.

35:36.083 --> 35:37.834
(Vera)
'You're still driving
the same car'

35:37.917 --> 35:40.000
'you and Clem took out
of Atlantic City.'

35:40.083 --> 35:41.542
And the only person who knew

35:41.625 --> 35:44.083
where Clem was going
that night..

35:44.166 --> 35:45.125
...Petey.

35:45.208 --> 35:46.458
It wasn't Petey.

35:46.542 --> 35:49.083
- Who, then?
- A-a guy.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.959
Clem called him Mack.

35:51.041 --> 35:53.291
There had to be
two people, May.

35:53.375 --> 35:55.500
Someone drove
that second car away.

35:55.583 --> 35:58.125
And somehow, the Chevy
ended up back with you.

35:58.208 --> 36:00.667
You would have given
us Mack right off.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.208
Unless he was with someone
you wanna protect.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.542
Maybe you and Petey
need to talk.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.417
Hey.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.250
Mayflower.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.375
Hi, Petey boy.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.166
May ID'd Henry Mack from a photo
spread as the shooter.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.417
So, we know he was
one of our guys

36:35.500 --> 36:37.458
at the scene,
but we still got

36:37.542 --> 36:39.417
the matter of who was with him.

36:39.500 --> 36:43.041
And who killed
him...
later that night.

36:43.125 --> 36:44.417
You ever make it in singing?

36:47.417 --> 36:49.208
I'm just a cocktail waitress.

36:50.709 --> 36:55.000
So May says you two made
a promise back when Clem died.

36:58.166 --> 36:59.208
Yeah.

37:00.875 --> 37:03.250
I'll keep it, Petey.

37:03.333 --> 37:04.417
I'm not scared.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.291
It's over for me.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.417
But you can still
have a good life.

37:14.208 --> 37:17.625
What happens...after Clem
takes off in that Chevy?

37:21.542 --> 37:23.583
He finds trouble.

37:23.667 --> 37:26.291
All 'cause of me.

37:30.542 --> 37:34.166
We both had our part in it.

39:34.834 --> 39:38.291
- Think you can steal from me?
- Mack..

39:48.417 --> 39:51.291
Take their car
and meet me back there.

39:51.375 --> 39:52.792
You gave him up?

39:52.875 --> 39:54.917
He was-he was gonna kill me.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.041
Get in the car and drive!

39:57.125 --> 39:58.375
Okay, okay.
