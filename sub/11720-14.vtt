Mr. Parrish, you sit before this
court having been convicted

00:14.295 --> 00:16.712
of the crime of murder
in the first degree.

00:16.714 --> 00:20.149
Despite the abundance
of evidence against you,

00:20.151 --> 00:23.486
you gave neither acknowledged
your guilt

00:23.488 --> 00:25.905
nor showed any remorse.

00:25.907 --> 00:29.191
Someday, you will sit in
judgment before a higher power.

You don't know?

02:07.074 --> 02:07.890
Mr. Williams...

02:07.892 --> 02:09.574
Principal Fisk will see you now.

02:09.577 --> 02:12.011
Thank you.

02:12.013 --> 02:14.246
Hope you beat the rap, buddy,
all right?

02:14.248 --> 02:16.949
Keep your chin up.

02:16.951 --> 02:20.085
The school code of conduct
requires that students both act

02:20.087 --> 02:21.554
in a safe and
responsible manner

02:21.556 --> 02:23.255
and respect the rights
of their peers.

02:23.257 --> 02:25.757
Unfortunately,
Grace is here today

02:25.759 --> 02:28.811
because she violated
both those rules.

02:28.813 --> 02:31.780
Okay, uh, look,
I, uh, I, uh,

02:31.782 --> 02:33.649
I know what kind
of kids get called

02:33.651 --> 02:34.850
into the principal's
office.

02:34.852 --> 02:37.386
I know that because
I was one of those kids.

02:37.388 --> 02:38.971
But in this case,

02:38.973 --> 02:42.774
the apple falls very far
away from the tree, okay?

02:42.776 --> 02:45.995
Grace is a very sweet and, uh,

02:45.997 --> 02:48.130
respectful young lady, always.

02:48.132 --> 02:49.882
No one doubts that,
Mr. Williams.

02:49.884 --> 02:52.751
But the fact remains

02:52.753 --> 02:54.553
that your daughter physically
struck a classmate.

02:54.555 --> 02:57.006
Well, then I'm gonna have
to say that, uh,

02:57.008 --> 02:58.390
maybe this kid deserved it.

02:58.392 --> 03:00.092
Had it coming,
you know?

03:00.094 --> 03:04.013
Hold on. It's never okay
to hit another student.

03:04.015 --> 03:06.932
Uh... oh... I don't know
if I agree with you.

03:06.934 --> 03:09.968
I mean, what if this kid
was picking on her?

03:09.970 --> 03:12.438
And he started it, and she was
just defending herself?

03:12.440 --> 03:15.024
I mean, how can you assume
that just, out of the blue,

03:15.026 --> 03:16.392
she acted with malicious intent?

03:16.394 --> 03:18.711
I'm sorry, are you a lawyer?

03:18.713 --> 03:20.646
No, no, no, no,
I'm a cop, you see.

03:20.648 --> 03:23.449
And, uh, as a cop,
we always, uh,

03:23.451 --> 03:25.584
we always think about
motive, right?

03:25.586 --> 03:27.670
Like when a girl
who's never been in trouble

03:27.672 --> 03:29.788
gets straight A's,
all of a sudden ends up

03:29.790 --> 03:31.290
in the principal's office,

03:31.292 --> 03:33.492
you got to think that there were
maybe extenuating circumstances.

03:33.494 --> 03:35.427
Very well.

03:35.429 --> 03:39.498
Grace, would you care
to explain to us

03:39.500 --> 03:42.451
why you punched Lucas Banks
so hard that he required

03:42.453 --> 03:44.503
four stitches
to stop the bleeding?

03:49.726 --> 03:51.527
I've got no excuse.

03:51.529 --> 03:52.745
I'm sorry.

03:52.747 --> 03:54.396
Thank you.

03:54.398 --> 03:55.731
I realize
it's not easy

03:55.733 --> 03:58.133
to admit when you're wrong.

03:59.619 --> 04:03.855
Now, uh, the only thing left
to discuss is your punishment.

04:03.857 --> 04:05.374
<i>Suspended for a week.</i>

04:05.376 --> 04:06.875
You understand that's
a big deal, right?

04:06.877 --> 04:07.710
You're aware of that?

04:07.712 --> 04:08.827
I know, Danno.
I'm sorry.

04:08.829 --> 04:09.861
What do you mean
you're sorry?

04:09.863 --> 04:10.746
Hold on. Stop.

04:10.748 --> 04:11.664
Explain something
to me, okay?

04:11.666 --> 04:12.915
Because I know
that you would

04:12.917 --> 04:15.367
never punch some kid in
the face for no reason.

04:15.369 --> 04:16.769
So tell me what happened.

04:16.771 --> 04:19.971
Lucas was picking on
my friend Katie.

04:19.974 --> 04:21.390
I told him to stop.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.208
And when he didn't,
you hit him?

04:23.210 --> 04:25.561
You said the only way
to deal with bullies

04:25.563 --> 04:26.762
is to stand up to them.

04:26.764 --> 04:28.981
Okay, that-that's fine.

04:28.983 --> 04:30.482
But why didn't you
say something

04:30.484 --> 04:31.900
when she asked you
what happened?

04:31.902 --> 04:33.319
Why didn't you
speak up?

04:33.321 --> 04:35.053
Because I'm no rat.

04:35.055 --> 04:37.656
You're-you're no rat?

04:39.727 --> 04:41.893
Who are you and what have
you done with my daughter?

04:43.580 --> 04:46.282
Listen to me: we will
discuss this further later,

04:46.284 --> 04:48.284
but for now,
you're grounded, you understand?

04:48.286 --> 04:50.169
Detective Williams.

05:01.966 --> 05:03.799
I mean,
I don't get it.

05:03.801 --> 05:05.768
Apparently, these days,
the kids pledge of allegiance,

05:05.770 --> 05:08.520
it's to the Mafia
Code of Omerta, right?

05:08.522 --> 05:11.106
I mean, I have no idea
what's gotten into her.

05:11.108 --> 05:13.609
Really?
Yes, really.

05:13.611 --> 05:15.611
She reminds me of
somebody else I know.

05:15.613 --> 05:16.928
Oh, yeah?
Who's that?

05:16.930 --> 05:19.097
Well, let's see.
She's, uh, she's scrappy,

05:19.099 --> 05:24.486
stubborn, hotheaded,
and loyal to a fault.

05:24.488 --> 05:26.405
She's you, pal.

05:26.407 --> 05:27.890
Ah, that's disturbingly
insightful.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.075
Maybe I was
a little hard on her, no?

05:30.077 --> 05:31.727
I think so.
Come on.

05:36.733 --> 05:39.084
Lou, what do we know?

05:39.086 --> 05:40.452
Our fugitive's name
is Roy Parrish.

05:40.454 --> 05:42.204
He ditched the van
he escaped in.

05:42.206 --> 05:43.922
He's been on the run
for 37 minutes.

05:43.924 --> 05:45.924
APB's gone out.
We got birds in the air,

05:45.926 --> 05:48.660
we got the roadblocks set up
within a 15-block radius.

05:48.662 --> 05:51.563
HPD is performing car-to-car
searches as we speak.

05:51.565 --> 05:53.632
Gentlemen, Mr. Parrish
is a three-striker.

05:53.634 --> 05:55.133
So we're putting away
the bean bags,

05:55.135 --> 05:56.268
and we going to the real thing.

05:56.270 --> 05:57.603
Because if this guy gets
cornered,

05:57.605 --> 05:59.071
no way he's gonna surrender.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.024
So, according
to the prosecutors,

06:02.026 --> 06:04.743
Roy Parrish was running a real
estate scam on rich marks

06:04.745 --> 06:06.311
all across the country.

06:06.313 --> 06:08.781
Hmm. See? There's another reason
why I rent.

06:08.783 --> 06:10.199
Apparently, he was
soliciting investments

06:10.201 --> 06:12.418
on a Honolulu land development
that never existed.

06:12.420 --> 06:15.354
One of the guys he conned
got wise and flew in to confront him.

06:15.356 --> 06:17.155
Guessing that didn't
work out so well for him.

06:17.157 --> 06:19.174
Parrish was arrested
for the murder.

06:19.176 --> 06:21.493
And since he was already
being investigated by the FBI

06:21.495 --> 06:24.663
for wire fraud, the case went Federal.
Parrish got life.

06:24.665 --> 06:25.997
Breaks out during
the sentencing hearing.

06:25.999 --> 06:28.684
What about the cameras?
Did they catch anything?

06:28.686 --> 06:29.835
The whole thing, thankfully.

06:29.837 --> 06:31.387
You might not believe it
otherwise.

06:31.389 --> 06:33.222
Check this out.
So Parrish is being

06:33.224 --> 06:35.841
led to a prisoner transport
when this happens.

06:41.064 --> 06:43.315
You know, something tells me
this isn't the first time

06:43.317 --> 06:45.033
Parrish has slipped
a pair of cuffs.

06:45.035 --> 06:47.453
He's been in and out
of jail his whole life.

06:47.455 --> 06:50.322
His last stint was 12 years
for armed robbery.

06:50.324 --> 06:53.575
He may have swapped
the shotgun for a business suit,

06:53.577 --> 06:56.128
but clearly, he's still
very dangerous.

06:56.130 --> 06:58.130
Hey, guys, so I just spoke
with the prosecutor.

06:58.132 --> 06:59.832
Apparently, the Feds had
a star eyewitness.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.199
It was a local
construction guy

07:01.201 --> 07:03.919
named Archie Akama who placed
Parrish at the murder scene.

07:03.921 --> 07:05.137
Now, during testimony,

07:05.139 --> 07:07.038
Parrish threatened
to kill this guy in open court.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.540
It took three marshals
to restrain him.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.642
Okay, get us
Akama's address.

07:10.644 --> 07:12.394
We should go grab him
and get him

07:12.396 --> 07:13.846
into protective custody
right away.

07:13.848 --> 07:16.014
Right. Meantime, you guys reach out
to Parrish's people.

07:16.016 --> 07:17.683
Hit friends, family,
former associates,

07:17.685 --> 07:19.351
anybody who could harbor
a fugitive.

07:19.353 --> 07:21.687
Okay. He's got a daughter
on the island.

07:21.689 --> 07:23.288
Kono and I will start there.

07:24.524 --> 07:26.275
This guy Parrish,
he's sharp enough

07:26.277 --> 07:28.226
to put together
an elaborate real estate scam.

07:28.228 --> 07:30.412
It's hard to imagine that he would risk
going back to prison

07:30.414 --> 07:31.897
just to take a shot
at a witness.

07:31.899 --> 07:32.948
I'm guessing
he's laying low,

07:32.950 --> 07:35.000
looking for a way
off the island right now.

07:35.002 --> 07:37.419
Yeah, maybe.
But he's not gonna last long

07:37.421 --> 07:38.954
without help, right?

07:38.956 --> 07:41.340
He'll have to surface
sooner or later.

07:50.633 --> 07:52.184
Drive.

08:08.315 --> 08:10.850
Okay, here's how
it's gonna go, big guy.

08:10.852 --> 08:12.368
Keep both your hands
on that wheel.

08:12.370 --> 08:15.822
Blondie, you go ahead
and pass me back those guns.

08:15.824 --> 08:17.123
I got a better idea.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.825
How about I send back
some handcuffs,

08:18.827 --> 08:21.027
you put 'em on,
nobody has to die, okay?

08:21.997 --> 08:23.197
You're the funny one, I guess.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.381
Guns!
Pass 'em back, grip first.

08:25.383 --> 08:27.033
Come on!
Give 'em to me.

08:27.035 --> 08:29.586
Clearly you haven't
thought this through.

08:29.588 --> 08:30.587
I mean, this entire
place is locked down.

08:30.589 --> 08:32.554
You're not getting
out of here.

08:32.557 --> 08:34.039
Oh, we'll just have
to see about that, won't we?

08:34.042 --> 08:35.842
Trust me, all right?

08:35.844 --> 08:38.845
The only way this ends well
for you is if you surrender

08:38.847 --> 08:39.879
yourself right now.

08:39.881 --> 08:41.397
I'll take that under advisement.

08:41.399 --> 08:44.684
Right now, all you gotta do
is shut up and drive.

08:44.686 --> 08:46.986
That's gonna be a problem.

09:02.253 --> 09:04.704
All right, blondie,
give me your phone.

09:16.550 --> 09:17.901
That your daughter?

09:20.888 --> 09:22.438
I say is that your daughter?

09:22.440 --> 09:23.656
Yeah.

09:25.860 --> 09:26.809
What's her name?

09:26.811 --> 09:29.095
Her name is Grace.

09:38.689 --> 09:40.456
Hi, Daddy.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.625
No, honey, I'm-I'm
not your daddy.

09:44.111 --> 09:46.246
I'm a good friend
of your daddy's,

09:46.248 --> 09:47.914
and he asked me to call you

09:47.916 --> 09:53.369
because there's a sound
that he wants you to hear, okay?

09:53.371 --> 09:55.371
Hold on.

09:57.708 --> 09:58.775
Now listen to me.

09:58.777 --> 10:01.177
You don't make it
through that checkpoint,

10:01.179 --> 10:04.463
she's gonna hear you die,
you understand?

10:04.465 --> 10:05.899
Danno...?

10:05.901 --> 10:07.050
You nod your head
if you understand.

10:07.052 --> 10:10.403
Danno, are you there?

10:11.939 --> 10:16.142
Here it comes, honey.
You just listen up.

10:18.579 --> 10:20.580
Danno?

10:25.152 --> 10:27.820
Danno, are you there?

10:30.909 --> 10:32.258
Grover.
Lou, it's McGarrett.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.777
Listen, our fugitive was just spotted.
Where?

10:34.779 --> 10:35.912
A service station
in Wai'anae.

10:35.914 --> 10:37.547
We need all available
resources up there

10:37.549 --> 10:39.482
to start searching
the area, okay?

10:39.484 --> 10:41.868
Wait a minute! That's halfway
across the island!

10:41.870 --> 10:43.703
I'm not gonna abandon our
perimeter on the hope

10:43.705 --> 10:44.804
that this thing is real.

10:44.806 --> 10:47.206
Listen, this is solid,
you understand?

10:47.208 --> 10:49.776
Solid. One of Chin Ho's
CI's called it in.

10:49.778 --> 10:51.761
And the longer we waste time,
the more time

10:51.763 --> 10:53.029
Parrish has to slip away.

10:53.031 --> 10:56.182
We need to boots on the ground
up there right now!

10:56.184 --> 10:58.901
Did you hear me? Right now.

11:07.027 --> 11:09.696
Turn around, let's go!
Let's go!

11:25.596 --> 11:27.146
Danno?

11:27.148 --> 11:28.547
Okay, Grace.

11:28.549 --> 11:30.650
We're gonna have
to try this again later.

11:30.652 --> 11:32.602
Bye.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.320
See...

11:34.322 --> 11:37.156
what you can get accomplished
if you put your mind to it?

11:38.659 --> 11:42.111
You didn't choose this car
by accident, did you?

11:44.198 --> 11:47.900
No, I didn't.

11:47.902 --> 11:50.286
Okay, I assume, uh,

11:50.288 --> 11:52.405
you got everything
figured out, so...

11:52.407 --> 11:54.490
you want to tell us
what happens next?

11:54.492 --> 11:56.175
What happens next is this:

11:56.177 --> 11:57.576
You're gonna handcuff
your partner's wrist

11:57.578 --> 11:58.511
to that steering wheel.

11:58.513 --> 12:00.463
Then give me
his phone.

12:00.465 --> 12:02.081
Looks like we're
gonna be spending

12:02.083 --> 12:03.916
a little bit of time together.

12:03.918 --> 12:05.601
Those things are trackable.

12:05.603 --> 12:07.553
So they got to go.

12:08.972 --> 12:10.973
Do it.
Come on.

12:18.615 --> 12:20.483
You know what, Parrish?

12:20.485 --> 12:21.868
Clearly you're a smart guy.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.736
I mean, getting out
of the courthouse,

12:23.738 --> 12:26.039
and making it this far,
that's impressive.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.457
But here's something
you might not know.

12:27.459 --> 12:30.576
Every single cop on the island
right now is looking for you.

12:30.578 --> 12:32.662
Plus the TSA and
the Port Authority

12:32.664 --> 12:34.047
have both been alerted,

12:34.049 --> 12:35.715
which means you show
your face at the airport

12:35.717 --> 12:38.384
or any of the docks, they're
gonna be all over you.

12:38.386 --> 12:39.802
And it's only a
matter of time

12:39.804 --> 12:41.554
before our team come
looking for us.

12:41.556 --> 12:45.174
So what I'm saying to you
is that with or without us,

12:45.176 --> 12:46.959
there is no way you're
getting off this island.

12:46.961 --> 12:49.262
But I'm not running.

12:49.264 --> 12:51.547
I got other plans.

12:58.572 --> 13:00.523
We need some new wheels.

13:16.423 --> 13:17.740
Parrish isn't here.

13:17.742 --> 13:19.509
And you are?

13:19.511 --> 13:22.095
Agents Kohl, Denson, FBI.

13:22.097 --> 13:23.546
Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly
from Five-O.

13:23.548 --> 13:25.431
This is Officer Kono Kalakaua.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.599
Yeah, Parrish was our case.

13:26.601 --> 13:27.800
We put in
a better part of a year

13:27.802 --> 13:29.852
to get that conviction,
just to have him skip on us

13:29.854 --> 13:32.638
during sentencing, so you know
this is an epic disaster.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.340
I got a Federal prosecutor
on my ass.

13:34.342 --> 13:36.442
All right, well, our team's
doing everything we can

13:36.444 --> 13:38.394
to bring Parrish in.
Good, we can use the help.

13:38.396 --> 13:40.196
Goes without saying he's one
slippery son of a bitch.

13:40.198 --> 13:41.864
So what'd the daughter
have to say?

13:41.866 --> 13:43.065
Nothing helpful.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.101
Maybe you guys'll have
better luck with her.

13:46.453 --> 13:47.987
Look, it's like
I already told the FBI.

13:47.989 --> 13:49.372
My father hasn't
been by here today

13:49.374 --> 13:51.324
and he hasn't tried
to contact me.

13:51.326 --> 13:53.126
When was the last time
you spoke with him?

13:53.128 --> 13:54.143
It's about a year ago.

13:54.145 --> 13:55.694
He called the night
he was arrested,

13:55.696 --> 13:57.180
swore he was innocent.

13:57.182 --> 13:58.831
Nothing since then?

14:10.627 --> 14:12.545
Here.

14:19.102 --> 14:20.353
Your father sent you
these from prison?

14:20.355 --> 14:22.772
At least two or three a week.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.323
But they're unopened.

14:24.325 --> 14:26.259
Didn't answer any of his
collect calls, either.

14:26.261 --> 14:28.578
That man's never been
a father to me.

14:28.580 --> 14:31.247
Why should I be
a daughter to him now?

14:31.249 --> 14:32.676
You're not curious
what he has to say?

14:32.701 --> 14:33.350
No.

14:33.351 --> 14:34.951
The man's a natural born liar.

14:34.953 --> 14:37.069
You can't trust a word
that comes out of his mouth.

14:38.422 --> 14:39.622
You mind if we hold onto these?

14:39.624 --> 14:41.374
Yeah, that's fine.

14:41.376 --> 14:42.875
I have no use for them.

14:44.761 --> 14:46.979
Petrie Park, right?

14:46.981 --> 14:49.031
I used to go there
with my dad

14:49.033 --> 14:50.016
when I was a kid.

14:50.018 --> 14:52.351
Sure that was nice.

14:52.353 --> 14:54.570
Look.

14:54.572 --> 14:56.689
Clearly there was a time

14:56.691 --> 14:58.174
when that man
meant something to you.

14:58.176 --> 15:01.427
Otherwise you wouldn't
have kept those letters.

15:01.429 --> 15:02.928
So if he tries to contact you,

15:02.930 --> 15:05.097
tell him to turn himself in.

15:05.099 --> 15:07.533
'Cause whatever
you may think of him now,

15:07.535 --> 15:10.520
I know you don't want this
to end badly for him.

15:33.627 --> 15:35.794
Aw, man.

15:48.992 --> 15:50.809
Is there a problem, Officer?

15:50.811 --> 15:53.812
Yeah, can you step
out of the car?

15:59.369 --> 16:01.604
Wait, are...
you even a cop?

16:01.606 --> 16:04.457
No, but, uh,

16:04.459 --> 16:06.092
they are.

16:06.094 --> 16:09.128
What size pants you wear?

16:09.130 --> 16:11.497
Like, 34?

16:11.499 --> 16:15.217
All right, this is Kauhi Street.

16:15.219 --> 16:17.019
What are we looking for?

16:17.021 --> 16:18.271
You'll know it
when you see it.

16:18.273 --> 16:19.722
Make a right.

16:27.481 --> 16:28.798
You figure it out yet?

16:28.800 --> 16:31.350
The eyewitness

16:31.352 --> 16:33.703
at your trial, Archie Akama.

16:33.705 --> 16:35.571
He was a construction worker.

16:35.573 --> 16:37.823
That it?
That's right, smart guy.

16:43.213 --> 16:45.581
How'd you know where
he was working?

16:45.583 --> 16:47.700
It's a funny thing
about being in prison...

16:47.702 --> 16:49.335
some of the biggest crooks
you're ever gonna meet

16:49.337 --> 16:50.369
are in there.

16:50.371 --> 16:51.704
The guards.

16:51.706 --> 16:55.174
I paid one them off
to get me an address.

16:55.176 --> 16:57.927
So, what, you're just gonna go
in there and pull Akama out?

16:57.929 --> 17:00.146
Not me.
That's what you're gonna do.

17:00.148 --> 17:02.348
You're gonna walk right
up to that foreman,

17:02.350 --> 17:03.766
show him that badge of yours,

17:03.768 --> 17:06.068
And you say
whatever you got to say.

17:06.069 --> 17:09.021
to get Akama to come out and
come back to the car with you.

17:09.022 --> 17:10.055
You got it?

17:10.057 --> 17:11.056
I got it. Is that it?

17:11.058 --> 17:12.023
Yeah, that's it.

17:12.026 --> 17:14.076
But know one thing:

17:14.078 --> 17:15.528
I'm gonna be watching.

17:15.530 --> 17:16.646
You disappear on me
for one second,

17:16.647 --> 17:18.998
I suspect you're
gonna tip them o,

17:19.000 --> 17:19.999
your partner here

17:20.001 --> 17:21.851
is shot dead.

17:23.819 --> 17:25.037
Okay.

17:37.634 --> 17:39.518
Your little buddy

17:39.520 --> 17:41.754
has quite an attitude problem.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.439
Doesn't he?

17:43.441 --> 17:44.724
Yeah, when you point
a gun in his face,

17:44.726 --> 17:46.091
it kind of brings out the worst
in him, you know?

17:46.093 --> 17:48.227
Yeah.

17:48.229 --> 17:50.189
Let's just hope he knows
how to follow directions.

18:00.907 --> 18:03.292
What happened?

18:03.294 --> 18:05.227
What'd he say?
According to the foreman,

18:05.229 --> 18:07.363
no one named Akama works here.

18:07.365 --> 18:08.881
You expect me to believe that?

18:08.883 --> 18:10.449
What, do you think I'm an idiot?

18:10.451 --> 18:11.634
You can believe what you want.

18:11.636 --> 18:12.835
That's what he said, okay?

18:12.837 --> 18:14.286
Maybe you're not taking
into consideration

18:14.288 --> 18:15.471
the fact that this guard,

18:15.473 --> 18:16.639
the guy that gave you
the address,

18:16.641 --> 18:17.640
maybe he played you, okay?

18:17.642 --> 18:18.641
He played me?

18:18.643 --> 18:20.009
Now I'm getting played
by guards.

18:20.011 --> 18:23.262
Don't try to get
inside my head, okay?

18:25.382 --> 18:26.198
Who's he talking to?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.400
What'd you say to him?

18:27.402 --> 18:28.517
I didn't say anything.

18:28.519 --> 18:29.769
You told him to call
the cops, didn't you?

18:29.771 --> 18:30.803
I didn't tell him
anything.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.188
Get out of here. Come on, drive.

18:32.190 --> 18:33.522
Wh-Where?

18:33.524 --> 18:35.191
Anyplace, just out of here.

18:35.193 --> 18:36.659
You're not thinking straight,
Roy, okay? Listen to me.

18:36.661 --> 18:37.810
Getting revenge against the guy

18:37.812 --> 18:39.028
who testified against you

18:39.030 --> 18:40.913
is not gonna change anything.

18:40.915 --> 18:41.864
What are you talking about?

18:41.866 --> 18:43.532
You think I want him dead?

18:43.534 --> 18:45.484
Archie Akama's
the last guy in the world

18:45.486 --> 18:48.287
I want dead.
Then why are you looking for him?

18:48.289 --> 18:50.539
He's the only one
that can clear my name.

18:54.127 --> 18:56.429
Now drive!

19:07.329 --> 19:09.714
Okay, do me a favor.
Explain something to me.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.049
How is it that the same guy
that testified against you

19:12.051 --> 19:14.886
is now gonna be the same guy
that clears your name? Hmm?

19:14.888 --> 19:16.921
I want to get him
to recant his testimony.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.257
Oh, right. With a gun to his head,
I'm sure he's gonna...

19:19.259 --> 19:20.641
admit to anything
you want him to.

19:20.643 --> 19:22.843
Maybe he'll say he's Santa Claus
or something. Hmm?

19:22.845 --> 19:24.929
The only way I'm ever
gonna prove I'm innocent

19:24.931 --> 19:27.315
is to have him admit
that he lied under oath.

19:27.317 --> 19:29.133
Wait a minute.
Why would he perjure himself

19:29.135 --> 19:30.401
just to get you convicted?

19:30.403 --> 19:32.687
Because the whole thing was
a massive frame-up

19:32.689 --> 19:33.971
from the get-go.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.389
Stop.
Back it up.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.807
Okay. What happened?

19:36.809 --> 19:38.509
Tell us what happened
from the beginning.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.529
Listen,
after my last little bit,

19:41.531 --> 19:45.583
I promised I was never
gonna go up again.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.335
I needed a job,

19:47.337 --> 19:49.987
I answered an ad in the newspaper
for a sales job, and I took it.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.990
I didn't know the whole damn
thing was just a scam.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.159
They were just looking
for some mope with a record

19:55.161 --> 19:57.995
to pin the whole thing on.
Who's "they"?

19:57.997 --> 20:00.331
Dale Sullivan. He's the one
that gave me the job.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.516
The one I went to
when one of the investors

20:02.518 --> 20:04.168
was making big noise
about the frame-up.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.937
Why didn't you go to the police?

20:05.939 --> 20:07.972
Sullivan said it was
all a misunderstanding.

20:07.974 --> 20:11.225
The next thing I know, the Feds
are kicking my door down,

20:11.227 --> 20:13.728
the investor's shot in the head

20:13.730 --> 20:15.613
and they got an eyewitness
on the scene.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.732
Archie Akama.
Paid off, no doubt.

20:17.734 --> 20:19.700
If that ain't enough,
they planted

20:19.702 --> 20:21.986
the murder weapon
in my place, okay?

20:21.988 --> 20:24.689
Soon as I saw that, I knew
it was Sullivan from the get.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.325
They made sure all the
contracts had my signature,

20:27.327 --> 20:30.711
they ran the cash through
an account he opened in my name.

20:30.713 --> 20:33.080
You add that up with the murder
weapon and the eyewitness,

20:33.082 --> 20:34.749
it was just the final nail.

20:34.751 --> 20:36.717
What'd the Feds say
when you told 'em all that?

20:36.719 --> 20:39.837
The same thing the two of you
are thinking right now,

20:39.839 --> 20:41.138
that I'm lying.

20:42.941 --> 20:45.760
So, did they look into Sullivan?
They said

20:45.762 --> 20:48.045
he didn't exist.
By the time I got arrested,

20:48.047 --> 20:49.981
he was already out
of the picture.

20:49.983 --> 20:53.401
I'll tell you one thing,
that little rat Akama,

20:53.403 --> 20:56.404
he's still out there somewhere,
and I'm gonna find him.

20:56.406 --> 20:59.023
Okay, um, well,
let's-let's say you do find him,

20:59.025 --> 21:00.391
let's say
you're telling the truth,

21:00.393 --> 21:02.243
you put a gun
to this guy's head, uh,

21:02.245 --> 21:03.744
and you get a confession
out of him,

21:03.746 --> 21:05.896
it's not gonna help you, okay?

21:05.898 --> 21:09.367
I mean, he would've been under
duress, and it'll never stick.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.068
Why do you think
I picked your car?

21:11.070 --> 21:13.621
Word is Five-O are the only cops
that will give a guy like me

21:13.623 --> 21:16.090
a fair shake.
Yeah, well,

21:16.092 --> 21:18.009
you know, our goodwill
usually runs out when someone...

21:18.011 --> 21:20.811
jacks our car and puts a gun to our heads.
It's the only way

21:20.813 --> 21:22.430
you were ever
gonna believe me.

21:22.432 --> 21:24.715
You heard it
from Akama's own mouth

21:24.717 --> 21:26.250
that he perjured himself.

21:26.252 --> 21:27.968
You find out that Sullivan
put him up to the whole

21:27.970 --> 21:29.720
damn thing.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.972
Listen,

21:31.974 --> 21:33.808
stick with me and help me
track him down.

21:33.810 --> 21:36.360
And if you do, you'll find out
I'm telling the truth.

21:40.282 --> 21:42.483
There's only one problem
with that.

21:42.485 --> 21:43.701
Akama's address

21:43.703 --> 21:46.937
was on those cell phones
you smashed.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.527
<i>Steve, it's me again.</i>

21:53.529 --> 21:55.129
Listen, I've got
an update for you,

21:55.131 --> 21:57.331
so give me a call
when you get this.

21:57.333 --> 21:59.834
I tracked down a bunch
of Parrish's old associates.

21:59.836 --> 22:01.168
They swear they
haven't heard

22:01.170 --> 22:02.670
from Parrish in years.

22:02.672 --> 22:04.321
See, that's interesting.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.740
Kono and I went
through the letters

22:05.742 --> 22:08.125
he wrote to his daughter
while he was in prison.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.527
Parrish swears

22:09.529 --> 22:10.928
that he'd gone straight.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.647
He claims that a guy named
Dale Sullivan set him up

22:13.649 --> 22:15.066
for both the embezzlement
and the murder.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.767
Okay, didn't his own
daughter herself say

22:16.769 --> 22:18.302
that he's
a skilled liar?

22:18.304 --> 22:19.402
If she doesn't believe
him, why should we?

22:19.427 --> 22:20.155
Right.

22:20.156 --> 22:21.772
Except for the fact
that one of the leads

22:21.774 --> 22:23.774
he asked her to look into
actually turned up something.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.192
Take a look
at this.

22:25.194 --> 22:27.128
It's an online
job posting

22:27.130 --> 22:28.446
that Parrish claims he answered.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.247
It actually expired
a little while ago,

22:30.249 --> 22:32.816
but I was able
to dig up a cached copy.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.585
Now, according to him,
this guy Sullivan

22:34.587 --> 22:36.153
interviewed him and
then hired him for a sales job.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.204
"Lucrative
commissions.

22:37.206 --> 22:39.540
No experience necessary."

22:39.542 --> 22:41.125
Thin on details, right?
Mm-hmm.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.944
And the e-mail address
for responses is anonymous.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.730
I checked with the Web site
and according to their records,

22:46.732 --> 22:47.932
52 people responded to this ad.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.350
And Parrish was one of them.

22:49.352 --> 22:51.001
Then we need to contact
every single person

22:51.003 --> 22:52.603
who responded
to this ad.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.855
Kono's with HPD right now,
doing exactly that.

22:54.857 --> 22:56.891
Okay, um...

22:56.893 --> 22:58.025
Let's suppose
for a second

22:58.027 --> 22:59.227
that Parrish
really was framed.

22:59.228 --> 23:01.278
I mean, if you're
looking for a fall guy,

23:01.280 --> 23:02.480
he certainly fits
the bill, right?

23:02.482 --> 23:03.864
Two-time felon.

23:03.866 --> 23:05.682
No one's gonna think twice about
throwing the book at him.

23:05.684 --> 23:06.734
It would also
explain why

23:06.736 --> 23:08.068
none of his old crew
have heard from him.

23:08.070 --> 23:10.070
Maybe he really did
clean up his act.

23:10.072 --> 23:11.372
You know, if Parrish
really was framed,

23:11.374 --> 23:12.890
Archie Akama lied under oath.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.708
I'm still waiting to hear

23:14.710 --> 23:16.210
whether the guys
picked Akama up.

23:16.212 --> 23:17.828
When I tried them earlier,
they weren't answering.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.880
I tried Steve three times
in the last hour.

23:19.882 --> 23:21.332
It keeps going to voicemail.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.767
Is that them?

23:23.769 --> 23:25.619
No, it's Grover.

23:25.621 --> 23:26.754
Lou, what's going on?

23:26.756 --> 23:27.922
What is going on

23:27.924 --> 23:30.174
is we just canvassed
all of Wai'anae.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.258
There's no sign of Parrish...

23:31.260 --> 23:32.893
if he was even here
to begin with.

23:32.895 --> 23:34.562
You need to get yourself
another CI.

23:34.564 --> 23:36.547
Wait a minute.
What CI?

23:36.549 --> 23:39.316
That CI of yours
who said he spotted Parrish.

23:39.318 --> 23:40.651
McGarrett called into me
a couple of hours ago.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.736
I haven't been able
to get a hold of him ever since.

23:42.738 --> 23:44.972
I never called McGarrett
about a CI.

23:44.974 --> 23:47.641
Well, so why would he lie to me?

23:47.643 --> 23:49.726
There's only one reason
why he'd lie to you.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.830
<i>Steve and Danny</i>
<i>are in trouble.</i>

23:52.832 --> 23:54.248
Okay, we are officially

23:54.250 --> 23:55.399
driving around in circles.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.417
What's next?

23:56.419 --> 23:57.701
I'm thinking.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.003
Well, think faster.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.538
'Cause we're gonna
run out of gas.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.239
Roy, it's time
to face the facts.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.591
You're out of options, okay?

24:03.593 --> 24:05.042
I mean, you can't
keep running,

24:05.044 --> 24:07.378
and you can't find
Akama by yourself.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.630
I could still shoot you both
and take the car.

24:09.632 --> 24:10.931
Yeah, that would
prove everything

24:10.933 --> 24:12.249
you just said is a lie.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.584
Now, if you want
to clear your name,

24:13.586 --> 24:14.852
if that's what
you want to do,

24:14.854 --> 24:15.886
there's only one way to do it.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.021
How's that?

24:17.023 --> 24:18.689
Yeah, how is that?

24:18.691 --> 24:19.923
You let us take you in.

24:19.925 --> 24:21.692
We track down Akama,

24:21.694 --> 24:22.977
sort out what's
going on.

24:22.979 --> 24:24.612
No Feds, no HPD.

24:24.614 --> 24:26.530
Just you and us
and Akama in a room.

24:26.532 --> 24:29.233
What, no catered lunch?

24:29.235 --> 24:30.451
This offer is
genuine, okay?

24:30.453 --> 24:31.952
It's the only offer
you're gonna get.

24:31.954 --> 24:34.121
You have my word,
I promise.

24:34.123 --> 24:36.407
If Akama is lying,
we will get it out of him.

24:38.076 --> 24:40.828
You came to us for a fair shake.

24:40.830 --> 24:43.130
You gonna let us
give you one or what?

24:43.999 --> 24:46.083
Okay, all right.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.052
I'll do it your way.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.515
Clear!

25:01.517 --> 25:03.250
- Clear.
- Help! Help me!

25:03.252 --> 25:06.520
Help me! Help!

25:08.823 --> 25:09.807
Thank God!

25:09.809 --> 25:12.693
Some lunatic
stole my car.

25:12.695 --> 25:14.745
What kind of car, exactly?

25:16.831 --> 25:18.916
<i>You know, I gotta, uh...</i>

25:18.918 --> 25:21.585
I gotta ask
a question.

25:21.587 --> 25:24.288
You are a three-time felon.

25:24.290 --> 25:27.174
Guys like you do not
get out of the joint

25:27.176 --> 25:29.493
and, uh, get jobs
selling real estate

25:29.495 --> 25:31.795
to rich investors.
Not legitimately, anyway.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.547
So you didn't kill anybody,
fine.

25:33.549 --> 25:35.516
But, uh, you must've known

25:35.518 --> 25:38.001
that what you were doing
was not on the up and up.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.305
How old's your daughter?

25:41.307 --> 25:43.107
Eleven?

25:43.109 --> 25:44.975
Twelve?

25:46.361 --> 25:49.012
Where were you
when she was born?

25:49.014 --> 25:50.364
I bet you were right there.

25:50.366 --> 25:52.533
You probably held
her in your arms

25:52.535 --> 25:54.401
and heard her
first little cry.

25:54.403 --> 25:57.121
Wouldn't be surprised
if you cut the cord.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.455
You probably did, didn't you?

25:59.291 --> 26:00.574
You know
where I was?

26:00.576 --> 26:01.575
No.

26:01.577 --> 26:04.244
Max seg, Otter Creek,

26:04.246 --> 26:06.413
Wheelwright,
Kentucky.

26:06.415 --> 26:07.698
By the time
I was released,

26:07.700 --> 26:12.386
my little girl was
already six years old.

26:12.388 --> 26:14.871
With my record...

26:14.873 --> 26:16.540
I was lucky if I could see her

26:16.542 --> 26:18.542
a couple hours every weekend.

26:19.594 --> 26:21.345
I'd take her
to the park

26:21.347 --> 26:23.564
and push her
on a swing

26:23.566 --> 26:25.766
and buy a shaved ice.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.687
You know what that's life.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.605
I was there

26:31.607 --> 26:34.408
every Saturday,
no matter what,

26:34.410 --> 26:37.444
until I...

26:37.446 --> 26:40.164
till I went up again.

26:40.166 --> 26:43.784
The years kept piling up,
one after another.

26:43.786 --> 26:45.586
By the time I got out,

26:45.588 --> 26:47.705
she wasn't a little girl
anymore.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.791
Already made up her mind
what kind of man I was.

26:50.793 --> 26:52.710
I figured

26:52.712 --> 26:54.712
that new job I had was my chance

26:54.714 --> 26:57.598
to make a little bit of money.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.249
Maybe put her in college,

26:59.251 --> 27:01.468
do something right
for once in my life.

27:01.470 --> 27:04.054
No.

27:04.056 --> 27:07.391
You guys go ahead and believe
whatever you want to.

27:09.261 --> 27:12.112
When did you tip them off? Right
after you gave me your word?!

27:12.114 --> 27:14.931
Nobody tipped anybody off, Roy.
I told you our team

27:14.933 --> 27:16.700
would come looking for us,
didn't I tell you that?

27:16.702 --> 27:18.535
Lose them! Now!

27:18.537 --> 27:21.104
Do you hear me?

27:39.674 --> 27:42.092
Now your turn.
Put 'em on, nice and tight.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.944
Back up. Put 'em on.

27:43.946 --> 27:45.679
Lean back.
Sit back.

27:57.927 --> 28:00.160
Buddy, just so you know,

28:00.162 --> 28:02.379
uh, the brake's
the square pedal on the left.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.114
I'm aware of that.
Okay, so what are you doing?

28:04.116 --> 28:05.783
Whatever you're doing,
don't do it, please.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.835
Listen to me, Danny.
Guilty guys-- they run.

28:07.837 --> 28:10.537
They don't kidnap a couple of
cops to prove they were framed.

28:10.539 --> 28:12.656
Okay, good. So we drop him off
at HPD, and then we look

28:12.658 --> 28:14.758
into the story ourselves.
Do not... without... No, we don't.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.043
No, we don't?
No, we don't. No, we don't.

28:16.045 --> 28:17.594
Why don't we?
Gave him our word

28:17.596 --> 28:20.347
we would track down Akama before
we turn him over to the cops.

28:20.349 --> 28:22.883
All right, that's
what we're gonna do.

28:22.885 --> 28:25.052
Sit back. Sit back.

28:29.691 --> 28:32.643
39 Olive Avenue, Wahiawa.

28:32.645 --> 28:34.528
What is that?
That is Akama's address, okay?

28:34.530 --> 28:36.363
The foreman did not say
that he wasn't working.

28:36.365 --> 28:37.614
He said
he wasn't working today.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.701
Okay?

28:40.703 --> 28:42.953
Oh, don't... Look, don't
give me a look, okay?

28:42.955 --> 28:44.571
I did the hard part.
All you got to do now

28:44.573 --> 28:46.156
is outrun the cops.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.228
Buckle up.
How?

28:53.532 --> 28:54.414
Hold on.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.479
<i>They did what?!</i>

29:08.481 --> 29:10.831
<i>McGarrett just evaded HPD.</i>

29:10.833 --> 29:12.182
Now, officers on

29:12.184 --> 29:14.151
the scene say
they saw Detective Williams

29:14.153 --> 29:15.519
with his gun on the fugitive.

29:15.521 --> 29:18.238
Which begs the question--
what the hell is going on?!

29:18.240 --> 29:19.556
I'm not sure.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.275
But I may have an idea
of where they're going.

29:21.277 --> 29:22.776
I'm on my way.

29:30.001 --> 29:32.002
Hey, take it easy.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.954
Nice and slow.

29:33.956 --> 29:36.089
I don't trust you in
these bracelets, either.

29:36.091 --> 29:37.674
Come on. Let's go see

29:37.676 --> 29:39.843
what Archie Akama has to say.
Turn around.

29:47.936 --> 29:49.987
Hold on. Hold on.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.121
Door's open.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.356
You stay with him.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.724
I'm going in.

30:07.939 --> 30:10.190
I got him.

30:28.893 --> 30:31.511
Akama was my only chance
of not going back to jail.

30:34.432 --> 30:36.466
It's all over. That's it.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.518
I'll call it in.

30:41.138 --> 30:42.406
No dial tone.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.442
Get down!

30:47.712 --> 30:50.747
Get down!

31:06.117 --> 31:07.167
Stay down!

31:07.169 --> 31:08.401
I'm staying down!

31:08.403 --> 31:09.986
Not you. Him.

31:09.988 --> 31:12.088
I got bullets flying
over my head! Huh?

31:34.478 --> 31:37.681
Nice entrance.

31:37.683 --> 31:40.600
Why is it everywhere you go,
people are shooting at you?

31:40.602 --> 31:43.370
Today, they weren't
gunning for me, okay?

31:43.372 --> 31:44.538
Where's Parrish?

31:44.540 --> 31:46.439
We got separated
during the gunfight.

31:46.441 --> 31:49.242
He ain't here. He's gone.

31:59.670 --> 32:01.388
Oh, thank God.

32:01.390 --> 32:03.139
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:03.141 --> 32:04.274
I'm fine, too.

32:04.276 --> 32:06.209
Glad to see you guys
in one piece.

32:06.211 --> 32:07.494
Any word on Parrish?

32:07.496 --> 32:09.646
No. HPD is canvassing
the neighborhood right now.

32:09.648 --> 32:11.147
Okay, so, what happened?

32:11.149 --> 32:13.683
Split up at the courthouse
to go find Parrish.

32:13.685 --> 32:16.102
Turns out, he was
in our car. My car.

32:16.104 --> 32:18.221
And, um, uh,
he's innocent, also.

32:18.223 --> 32:20.490
The Feds convicted
the wrong guy.

32:20.492 --> 32:22.943
This man Dale Sullivan--
he, uh... he framed Parrish

32:22.945 --> 32:24.261
for the murder.
He also paid off Akama

32:24.263 --> 32:25.695
to lie under oath.

32:25.697 --> 32:26.863
That much we know.

32:26.865 --> 32:28.248
We got Kono running down a lead
right now.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.066
Hopefully, she can tell us
who this Sullivan guy really is.

32:30.068 --> 32:31.251
Well, whoever he is,

32:31.253 --> 32:33.336
I'm thinking that he
found out Parrish escaped,

32:33.338 --> 32:35.571
came here to kill
Akama to make sure

32:35.573 --> 32:36.957
he didn't recant
his testimony.

32:36.959 --> 32:38.458
Right. Then he sat
on the house,

32:38.460 --> 32:40.126
hoping that Parrish
would come back here.

32:40.128 --> 32:41.761
We need
to I.D. these shooters ASAP.

32:41.763 --> 32:43.179
All right?
On it.

32:44.048 --> 32:45.682
No sign of Parrish.

32:45.684 --> 32:47.434
Lady next door
had her car stolen.

32:47.436 --> 32:48.652
Found these in the driveway.

32:48.654 --> 32:51.254
All right,
let's get the plate number out.

32:51.256 --> 32:53.523
Make sure HPD keeps close
eyes on Parrish's daughter.

32:53.525 --> 32:55.414
He's on his own now.
He may turn to her.

32:55.439 --> 32:56.277
Yeah.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.778
Let's get photos and prints
of all these dead bodies.

32:58.780 --> 33:01.848
We need to get CSU started
on running I.D.'s.

33:01.850 --> 33:03.700
Let's take a look.

33:07.538 --> 33:09.472
Kono, what do you got?

33:09.474 --> 33:12.442
So far we tracked down 12 people
who responded to the job post.

33:12.444 --> 33:13.910
Three of them
have criminal records.

33:13.912 --> 33:16.112
Now coincidentally,
those same three are

33:16.114 --> 33:18.365
the only ones who were called in
for a job interview

33:18.367 --> 33:19.666
with a man named Dale Sullivan.

33:19.668 --> 33:20.884
They were being screened--
Sullivan was

33:20.886 --> 33:22.118
looking for someone
with a record

33:22.120 --> 33:23.303
to pin the crime on.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.755
That's not all.
So based on the descriptions,

33:25.757 --> 33:27.974
I had HPD put together
a composite sketch of Sullivan.

33:27.976 --> 33:29.843
Chin, you're never
gonna believe this,

33:29.845 --> 33:31.978
but we met
this guy, today.

33:31.980 --> 33:33.647
The FBI agent
from this morning.

33:33.649 --> 33:36.149
Yeah, Agent Kohl.
How'd you know that?

33:36.151 --> 33:39.219
I'm standing over
his partner's body right now.

33:40.438 --> 33:42.355
Parrish isn't here.

33:42.357 --> 33:44.541
You are...?

33:45.359 --> 33:46.977
Agent Kohl.

33:46.979 --> 33:49.779
Our fake Fed is Julian Lynch.

33:49.781 --> 33:52.148
Arrested back in 2008
for securities fraud,

33:52.150 --> 33:54.417
but investigators couldn't
make the charges stick.

33:54.419 --> 33:55.835
Seems like this guy
has a knack

33:55.837 --> 33:57.837
for staying one step removed
from the cons he runs.

33:57.839 --> 34:00.006
Yeah, by setting other
people up to take the fall.

34:00.008 --> 34:01.591
Look-- according to TSA,
Lynch arrived

34:01.593 --> 34:04.044
in Hawaii
back in December of 2012.

34:04.046 --> 34:05.378
That's three weeks before

34:05.380 --> 34:06.996
Parrish responded
to the job posting.

34:06.998 --> 34:09.431
Right. That's when Parrish
became Lynch's patsy.

34:09.434 --> 34:11.501
Did you say "patsy"?

34:11.503 --> 34:14.187
I did. I've been wanting
to use that word for a while.

34:14.188 --> 34:15.505
You know,
if Lynch is bold enough

34:15.507 --> 34:17.172
to pose as an FBI agent
to track this guy down,

34:17.175 --> 34:19.391
he's not gonna stop now just
because the heat's turned up.

34:19.393 --> 34:21.478
Right. That's why we need
to find Parrish before he does.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.696
McGarrett.

34:22.697 --> 34:24.364
The HPD unit we put
on Parrish's daughter

34:24.366 --> 34:26.181
just called in to say
she's leaving her house.

34:26.184 --> 34:27.534
Is he still tailing her?
He was,

34:27.536 --> 34:29.902
and then 15 minutes ago
he stopped answering his radio.

34:38.746 --> 34:40.580
Lauren.

34:52.176 --> 34:54.643
Thanks for meeting me here.

34:54.646 --> 34:56.730
Listen, I gotta...

34:56.732 --> 34:59.382
disappear for a while.

35:01.102 --> 35:03.770
But before I do, there's...

35:03.772 --> 35:05.989
something I wanted you to know.

35:09.410 --> 35:11.894
Never killed that man.

35:11.896 --> 35:15.448
Guess I never gave you
much reason to believe me,

35:15.450 --> 35:17.667
but you gotta believe me now.

35:19.069 --> 35:21.871
Please say you do.

35:25.793 --> 35:28.762
You shouldn't have run.

35:30.581 --> 35:31.765
What'd you do?

35:32.917 --> 35:37.470
In her defense,
she thought I was FBI.

35:40.141 --> 35:42.559
Wait, what's going on?

35:42.561 --> 35:45.395
What's going on is, probably
for the first time in his life,

35:45.397 --> 35:47.096
your father's telling the truth.

36:03.955 --> 36:06.956
Listen, do whatever
you got to do,

36:06.958 --> 36:09.309
but let my daughter go.
Maybe.

36:09.311 --> 36:10.727
We'll see.

36:10.729 --> 36:11.885
You know, it didn't
have to go this way.

36:11.910 --> 36:14.044
You could've just lived the rest
of your life in prison.

36:14.045 --> 36:16.896
For a crime I didn't commit?
Does that really matter?

36:16.897 --> 36:18.530
I mean, come on,
no offense, but a guy

36:18.532 --> 36:21.833
like you, sooner or later, you
were gonna end up back there.

36:21.835 --> 36:24.503
Please don't do this.
Sorry, hon, I can't be constantly

36:24.505 --> 36:26.204
looking over my should,
wondering if and when

36:26.206 --> 36:28.874
Daddy here is gonna pop up
and get his revenge.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.467
Officer down.

36:39.469 --> 36:41.753
He's gone.
This one belongs to Lauren Parrish.

36:41.755 --> 36:43.438
He must have tailed her here.
There's a lookout about

36:43.440 --> 36:44.806
a half mile down
through those woods.

36:44.808 --> 36:46.858
That's got to be where they are.
Let's go. Come on.

36:46.860 --> 36:49.594
- I'm so sorry, Dad.
- Please stop crying.

36:49.596 --> 36:52.197
You're the only good thing
that ever came out of me.

36:54.066 --> 36:55.650
Let's face it...

36:55.652 --> 36:59.404
I've made enough mistakes
for... two lifetimes.

36:59.406 --> 37:01.773
It's not your fault.

37:01.775 --> 37:04.659
Listen, this is
between you and me.

37:04.661 --> 37:05.661
She doesn't need
to see...

37:06.914 --> 37:08.713
Daddy!

37:08.715 --> 37:11.132
Daddy? Daddy...

37:13.453 --> 37:15.804
You son of a bitch!

37:20.811 --> 37:23.511
D... Daddy...

37:23.513 --> 37:25.981
Kill her, and dump 'em both.

37:39.845 --> 37:41.780
Daddy...

37:41.782 --> 37:43.865
Daddy...

37:43.867 --> 37:45.650
Okay, why don't you come with us.
Daddy...

37:45.652 --> 37:47.702
Let's give them some space
to work, okay? Come on.

37:47.704 --> 37:49.754
I got to get pressure
on this wound.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.207
This is 3901 to Central.

37:52.209 --> 37:54.509
I got a male GSW,
critical condition.

37:54.511 --> 37:57.596
I need a 10-10 expedited
to my location.

37:58.681 --> 38:01.165
Stay with us, Roy.

38:03.854 --> 38:05.553
His pulse is fading.

38:05.555 --> 38:08.640
Chin. Send her over.

38:10.393 --> 38:12.177
Lauren, come here.

38:12.179 --> 38:14.362
Come here.
Keep your hands here.

38:14.364 --> 38:17.816
Give me your hand.
He can hear you, okay?

38:17.818 --> 38:20.485
You talk to him. Talk to him.

38:21.787 --> 38:23.955
I believe you.

38:23.957 --> 38:26.825
I believe you.

38:26.827 --> 38:29.027
I believe you.

38:32.632 --> 38:35.867
I love you.
I always have.

39:22.631 --> 39:26.434
<i>Lauren Parrish, on behalf</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

39:26.436 --> 39:28.920
District Court of Hawaii,
I would like to apologize

39:28.922 --> 39:31.973
for the gross miscarriage
of justice that resulted

39:31.975 --> 39:34.275
in your father's
wrongful conviction.

39:34.277 --> 39:36.478
It will never bring him back,

39:36.480 --> 39:39.097
but the record will now show
that Randall Parrish

39:39.099 --> 39:41.866
was posthumously pardoned
of all charges.

39:52.795 --> 39:55.296
Thank you for coming.

40:02.972 --> 40:06.257
Figured you might
want these back.

40:11.347 --> 40:13.732
I'm still holding out hope that

40:13.734 --> 40:16.518
<i>one day you'll</i>
<i>read these letters.</i>

40:16.520 --> 40:18.186
<i>Because my biggest fear</i>

40:18.188 --> 40:21.305
<i>isn't that I'll spend</i>
<i>the rest of my life in prison</i>

40:21.307 --> 40:23.775
<i>for a crime I didn't do,</i>

40:23.777 --> 40:27.445
<i>it's that I'll die in here</i>
<i>without getting the chance</i>

40:27.447 --> 40:31.583
<i>to tell you</i>
<i>how proud I am of you...</i>

40:31.585 --> 40:35.086
<i>and how much you mean to me.</i>

40:35.088 --> 40:36.755
<i>The time we spent together</i>

40:36.757 --> 40:39.791
<i>were the happiest moments</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

40:39.793 --> 40:42.377
<i>And I want you to know</i>
<i>that there's nothing</i>

40:42.379 --> 40:45.663
<i>that's made me happier</i>
<i>than being your daddy.</i>

41:04.683 --> 41:07.869
I don't get it;
I thought I was grounded.

41:09.905 --> 41:11.639
Uh...

41:11.641 --> 41:14.209
I had some time to think
about it, and, uh...

41:14.211 --> 41:17.662
I realized I was maybe a little
bit too hard on you, okay?

41:18.714 --> 41:21.132
You were?

41:21.134 --> 41:22.383
Yes. I was.

41:22.385 --> 41:24.719
Listen, um... I want
you to know something.

41:24.721 --> 41:26.838
I am very proud
of you, you know,

41:26.840 --> 41:28.389
for sticking up
for your friend.

41:28.391 --> 41:30.341
I'm sorry I didn't
say that yesterday.

41:30.343 --> 41:32.143
All right?

41:32.145 --> 41:33.645
You know, I make mistakes,
too, sometimes.

41:33.647 --> 41:36.097
I don't always know what
the right thing to do is.

41:36.099 --> 41:38.049
But I always...
I always love you,

41:38.051 --> 41:39.918
no matter what, all right?

41:39.920 --> 41:42.770
Come here.
You're the best.

41:56.253 --> 41:58.169
Hey!
Hey!

41:58.171 --> 41:59.704
Hey, look who made it.

41:59.706 --> 42:02.123
Hey, Grace, I got a seat
right here for you.

42:02.125 --> 42:03.458
Yeah, sit down, guys.

42:03.460 --> 42:04.575
Help us finish off
these pu-pu's.

42:04.577 --> 42:06.845
Yeah, I don't, uh, think

42:06.847 --> 42:08.963
that sounds right to me,
still, to this day.

42:08.965 --> 42:10.515
Oh.

42:10.517 --> 42:13.718
Whoa! That is some serious
bruising you got there.

42:13.720 --> 42:15.670
You should see the other guy.

42:15.672 --> 42:17.522
Oh! Ooh!

42:20.026 --> 42:21.759
Okay, I'm gonna
go get another round.

42:21.761 --> 42:22.777
Danny, come for a walk.

42:22.779 --> 42:25.063
Do you need me
to pay for it?

42:25.065 --> 42:27.198
No, I've got Catherine's Amex.
Oh, nice. Be right back.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.100
You got to help me out, Grace.

42:29.102 --> 42:30.985
I was just trying
to convince the guys

42:30.987 --> 42:33.154
we should hit the pool
for a little dip.

42:33.156 --> 42:35.356
All right, come on, now,
we got food here,

42:35.358 --> 42:37.192
people trying to eat--
don't nobody want to see

42:37.194 --> 42:39.277
all that.
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

42:39.279 --> 42:41.296
You're just chickening out
of the belly flop contest

42:41.298 --> 42:43.331
- I challenged you to.
- That sounds fun.

42:43.333 --> 42:46.084
Hey, hey, hey,
don't encourage him.

42:46.086 --> 42:48.253
Hey, uh, can I have
three more of these, please?

42:48.255 --> 42:49.687
And, uh, what
are you drinking?

42:49.689 --> 42:51.172
I will have a
Longboard... Wow.

42:51.174 --> 42:53.124
Yeah, a Longboard
and a Shirley Temple

42:53.126 --> 42:54.058
for my date.

42:54.060 --> 42:55.210
Here it is.
You got money.

42:55.212 --> 42:56.511
That's amazing.
Yeah, I work.

42:56.513 --> 42:58.062
I make money.

42:58.064 --> 42:59.264
Thank you.

42:59.266 --> 43:01.499
Don't touch it.

43:01.501 --> 43:03.484
You're welcome.
Oh, thank you.

43:03.486 --> 43:04.819
You're welcome.

43:14.697 --> 43:16.948
She's a great kid, Dan.

43:16.950 --> 43:19.701
Yeah, she's got
a mean right cross, too.
