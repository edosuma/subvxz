MORE LIKE A
WITCH, ANYWAY.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.275
YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!

13:07.912 --> 13:09.662
MR. HARPER?

13:09.830 --> 13:11.289
YES. COME IN.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.167
YOUR WIFE TOLD ME
YOU WERE UP.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.753
YEAH, IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.214
DID YOU HAVE A LOOK
AROUND THE PLACE?

13:19.381 --> 13:20.340
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.425
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY HORSES?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.511
I'M AFRAID TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.929
YOU MIGHT RAISE
THE PRICE ON ME.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.680
I DON'T DO BUSINESS
THAT WAY.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.057
IN THAT CASE,
I THINK THEY'RE SOME

13:29.225 --> 13:30.350
OF THE BEST-LOOKING
ANIMALS I'VE SEEN.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.519
GOOD. GOOD. YOU'RE AN
INTELLIGENT MAN.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.312
BUT THAT'S JUST A SAMPLE.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.899
IT'LL TAKE A FEW DAYS
TO ROUND UP ALL THE HORSES
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.610
TAKE YOUR TIME.
I'M IN NO HURRY.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.113
MAN'S GOT TO TAKE TIME
TO PICK OUT GOOD HORSES.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.991
OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU WANT SOME IRISH COFFEE?

13:47.159 --> 13:49.702
NO, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.287
A LITTLE HAIR
OF THE DOG.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.457
BRET? I DON'T
WANT TO BOTHER YOU
IF YOU'RE BUSY,

13:54.625 --> 13:57.585
BUT THE CHILDREN
ARE READY ANYTIME
YOU ARE.

13:57.753 --> 13:59.212
READY? READY FOR WHAT?

13:59.380 --> 14:03.174
OH, FOR THE PICNIC
WE PLANNED FOR THIS
AFTERNOON, REMEMBER?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.093
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DO I REMEMBER?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.887
YOU THINK I HAVE
NOTHING ELSE TO THINK
ABOUT TODAY?

14:08.055 --> 14:09.681
A PICNIC?
I'M RUNNING A RANCH.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.267
I KNOW, BRET. I--
I JUST...

14:12.434 --> 14:15.144
WELL, YOU PROMISED
THEM, AND YOU KEEP
PUTTING IT OFF.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.688
I'M BUSY.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.439
LOOK, IF YOU TWO
HAVE SOMETHING PLANNED,

14:18.607 --> 14:21.526
WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD WITH IT?
I'M NOT IN ANY HURRY.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.778
IT WOULD MAKE
THE CHILDREN
SO HAPPY.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.238
I TOLD YOU I'M BUSY.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.657
I'VE GOT TO GO
INTO TOWN TODAY.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.868
ISN'T IT
JUST LIKE A WOMAN?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.828
WANTS ALL THE THINGS
MONEY CAN BUY,

14:31.996 --> 14:33.872
BUT JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HER HUSBAND

14:34.039 --> 14:37.000
HAS TO WORK ALL THE TIME
TO PAY FOR THEM.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.297
I'LL HAVE ALL
THOSE HORSES ROUNDED UP

14:42.464 --> 14:44.007
AND IN THE CORRALS
TOMORROW,

14:44.174 --> 14:46.342
AND YOU
CAN TAKE A LOOK.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.477
[DOOR OPENS]

14:57.897 --> 14:59.689
[DOOR CLOSES]

15:07.531 --> 15:10.033
THOUGHT I SMELLED
A LITTLE FRIED CHICKEN
COOKING EARLIER.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.451
CHILDREN LOVE IT.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.911
SO DOES
YOUR HOUSEGUEST.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.370
SURE LIKE
TO JOIN YOU.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.872
I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO DO AROUND HERE.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.624
THAT'S VERY KIND,
MR. INGALLS, BUT--

15:17.791 --> 15:19.167
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH KIND.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.336
I'D LIKE
TO COME ALONG.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.755
ALL RIGHT.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.049
I'LL HITCH UP THE TEAM.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.474
HEY, YOU KIDS WANT TO
GO ON A PICNIC OR NOT?

15:34.642 --> 15:36.142
YEAH, IF WE PLAY GAMES.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.393
WELL, THAT ALL DEPENDS.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.436
Thomas: ON WHAT?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.104
YOU HELP ME
HITCH UP THE TEAM.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.190
OK. LET'S GO!
YEAH!

15:43.525 --> 15:45.777
Charles: HEY, HEY!
COME ON, YOU GUYS!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.487
SAVE ME!

15:47.655 --> 15:49.072
THEY'RE GOING TO GET ME!

15:49.239 --> 15:54.118
HA HA HA!

15:54.286 --> 15:57.413
OH, NO! ALL RIGHT!
YOU GOT ME!

15:57.581 --> 15:58.831
WE'LL BE IT AGAIN.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.541
OH, NO. NO. COME ON.
I GOTTA REST.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.126
COME ON.
JUST ONCE MORE.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.336
WE WON'T ASK AGAIN.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.380
YOU'VE SAID
THAT ALL AFTERNOON.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.382
YOU'VE WORN MR. INGALLS OUT.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.092
ALL RIGHT. LOOK.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.760
YOU TWO
GO FIND A DRAGON,

16:10.928 --> 16:12.595
AND WHEN YOU FIND HIM,
I'LL HELP YOU CATCH HIM.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.597
THERE'S NO SUCH
THING AS DRAGONS.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.974
WELL, OF COURSE
THERE IS.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.433
YOU SEEN LIZARDS,
HAVEN'T YOU?

16:17.601 --> 16:20.645
YEAH, BUT LIZARDS ARE SMALL,
AND DRAGONS ARE BIG.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.314
WELL, A LIZARD IS
NOTHING BUT A BABY DRAGON.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.316
HEY! THAT'S RIGHT!

16:25.484 --> 16:27.276
COME ON. LET'S GO.
WE'LL FIND ONE.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.361
ALL RIGHT!

16:28.529 --> 16:29.737
YOU LOOK HARD, NOW.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.948
TAKE A LOT OF TIME.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.449
WHOO!

16:33.617 --> 16:35.159
HA HA HA!

16:35.327 --> 16:37.787
I'M GLAD THEY BOUGHT
THAT DRAGON STORY.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.289
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
PLOWING SINCE SUNUP.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.541
I CAN IMAGINE.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.668
YOU HAVE BEEN AT IT
ALL AFTERNOON.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.795
Charles:
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,

16:45.963 --> 16:47.463
I QUIT 'CAUSE I WAS LOSING.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.756
I CAN'T STAND TO LOSE.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.259
HA HA HA! WE HAVE
SOME TEA LEFT.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.302
I'D LOVE SOME.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.096
WHOO!

16:55.264 --> 16:57.432
THEY WORE ME OUT.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.808
HERE YOU GO.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.643
OH, THANK YOU.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.272
MMM.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.356
MORE?

17:05.524 --> 17:08.401
NOPE. SAVE THE REST
FOR THE YOUNG ONES.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.612
DRAGON HUNTING
IS VERY THIRSTY WORK.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.698
ARE YOU MARRIED,
MR. INGALLS?

17:13.866 --> 17:14.824
UH-HUH. YEAH.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.160
YOU HAVE SUCH A WAY
WITH CHILDREN.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.995
YOU MUST HAVE
SOME OF YOUR OWN.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.997
OH, YEAH. I'VE GOT
4 GIRLS AND A BOY.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.041
DO YOU HAVE
THEM BELIEVING
IN DRAGONS, TOO?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.793
LONG AS I CAN, I WILL.

17:29.381 --> 17:33.009
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THE CHILDREN THAT HAPPY
IN A LONG TIME.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.136
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE DAYS
WHEN A STRANGER COMES ALONG,

17:35.304 --> 17:36.846
PLAYS REAL HARD
WITH YOUR KIDS,

17:37.014 --> 17:39.015
THEN GOES ON HIS
MERRY WAY DOWN THE ROAD,

17:39.183 --> 17:42.560
AND THE KIDS EXPECT YOU
TO PLAY THAT HARD WITH THEM
EVERY DAY.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.440
THE ONLY OTHER
STRANGER THEY KNOW
IS THEIR FATHER.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.361
I'M SORRY.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.866
I'M AFRAID I'M NOT
MUCH FUN AT PICNICS.

18:02.706 --> 18:06.501
MY HUSBAND WASN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS,
YOU KNOW.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.339
IT'S A SILLY THING
TO SAY--"YOU KNOW."

18:11.507 --> 18:13.800
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE A STRANGER.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.887
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
IT'S EASIER TO TALK
TO STRANGERS.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.477
BRET WAS A--
WAS A FINE HUSBAND.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.648
DEVOTED TO HIS CHILDREN.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.487
HE SPOILED
THEM TOO MUCH,
BUT HE LOVED THEM.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.115
ESPECIALLY MICHAEL.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.037
HE WAS THE OLDEST.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.415
BEAUTIFUL BOY.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.793
STEAL YOUR HEART
IN A MINUTE.

18:51.588 --> 18:55.258
HE WENT EVERYWHERE
WITH HIS FATHER.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.386
BRET WOULD PUT HIM
IN FRONT OF HIM
IN THE SADDLE,

18:58.554 --> 19:00.930
AND THEY'D RIDE
HALF THE DAY.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.519
ONE MORNING,
THE HORSE STUMBLED.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.150
IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.489
OUR SON DIED
THAT NIGHT.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.753
MY WIFE AND I
LOST A SON.

19:32.921 --> 19:36.966
CHARLES JUNIOR,
ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.764
HOW DOES A PERSON
EVER GET OVER IT?

19:45.184 --> 19:48.686
I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER GET OVER
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

19:50.147 --> 19:53.900
I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY FAITH
IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME. I...

19:55.444 --> 19:59.113
JUST DON'T THINK
A PERSON CAN HANDLE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALONE.

20:03.952 --> 20:07.830
HOW DO YOU GET
THAT KIND OF FAITH?

20:07.998 --> 20:10.458
BY WANTING IT
BAD ENOUGH.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.379
WANTING TO BELIEVE.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.258
Thomas: MR. INGALLS, COME QUICK!
WE FOUND A DRAGON!

20:19.426 --> 20:21.010
I'M COMING.

20:26.391 --> 20:30.019
YOU CAN EVEN SEE A DRAGON
IF YOU BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.965
CAN I HEAT THAT UP
FOR YOU?

20:59.132 --> 21:00.716
YEAH. THANK YOU.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.303
YOU TWO FINISH THAT MILK.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.222
BEEN AT IT LONG ENOUGH.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.224
FOOLING AROUND WITH IT.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.309
IT'S TIME TO GET TO BED.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.728
Thomas:
CAN'T WE STAY UP
JUST A LITTLE LONGER?

21:12.896 --> 21:14.021
NO.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.607
BUT WE WANT TO TELL DADDY
ABOUT THE DRAGON AND ALL.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.235
I TOLD YOU YOUR FATHER
MAY HAVE TO WORK LATE.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.613
HOW COME DADDY
HAS TO WORK LATE
EVERY NIGHT?

21:22.781 --> 21:24.115
HE JUST HAS TO.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.492
NOW FINISH THAT MILK.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.457
I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU HURRY UP
AND FINISH THAT MILK,

21:33.625 --> 21:35.293
I'LL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS
AND TUCK YOU IN

21:35.460 --> 21:37.044
AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE DREAM
TO DREAM,

21:37.212 --> 21:38.921
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOUR MA.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.840
IS IT ALL RIGHT?

21:42.926 --> 21:44.635
YES.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.013
ALL RIGHT. GET GOING.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.932
Charles: COME ON.
HURRY UP AND DOWN IT.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.767
YOUR SISTER'S
BEATING YOU.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.811
HA HA HA!

21:55.856 --> 21:58.024
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.822
I'LL MAKE IT QUICK.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.578
Samantha:
THIS IS MY BED.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.912
Thomas:
AND THIS IS MINE.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.539
THEY'RE NICE, TOO.
HERE.

22:13.707 --> 22:14.790
GIVE ME THAT ROBE.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.834
YOU BETTER SIT ON MY BED
TO TELL US OUR DREAM.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.044
HE WETS HIS.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.337
Thomas: I DO NOT.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.880
YOU DO TOO,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.840
WELL, NOW, WAIT.
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT
WETTING THE BED?

22:23.008 --> 22:23.966
LOTS OF PEOPLE DO.

22:24.134 --> 22:24.884
THEY DO?

22:25.052 --> 22:26.427
WELL, SURE THEY DO.
I DID.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.554
ARE YOU MAKING UP
A STORY?

22:28.722 --> 22:29.805
CROSS MY HEART.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.390
DO YOU STILL?

22:31.558 --> 22:33.309
OF COURSE NOT.
I GREW OUT OF IT,

22:33.477 --> 22:34.727
JUST THE WAY
THOMAS WILL.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.103
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.980
I AM RIGHT. DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.816
NOW I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU THAT DREAM.
ARE YOU READY?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.651
YEP.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.112
ALL RIGHT. THIS
DREAM TAKES PLACE

22:45.280 --> 22:46.989
WAY, WAY UP
IN THE CLOUDS.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.116
DON'T MAKE IT SCARY.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.743
I'M NOT MAKING IT SCARY.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.286
YOU ARE TOO,

22:52.454 --> 22:55.039
BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE
UP IN THE CLOUDS,
WE'RE IN HEAVEN,

22:55.207 --> 22:56.749
AND WE'RE DEAD.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.042
THIS ISN'T HEAVEN.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.668
THIS IS A DIFFERENT
KIND OF PLACE

22:59.836 --> 23:01.212
AND DIFFERENT KIND
OF CLOUDS.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.672
'CAUSE THESE CLOUDS
ARE MADE OUT OF
MARSHMALLOWS,

23:03.840 --> 23:06.050
AND YOU CAN EAT
AS MANY OF THEM
AS YOU WANT.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.470
THEN WE CAN RUN AROUND,
PLAY HIDE AND SEEK
AROUND THE CLOUDS,

23:09.638 --> 23:11.180
AND IF
WE GET REAL TIRED,

23:11.348 --> 23:12.848
WE JUST
CLOSE OUR EYES,

23:13.016 --> 23:15.351
LIE DOWN ON A
CLOUD THAT'S JUST
LIKE A PILLOW

23:15.519 --> 23:18.354
AND SLEEP
AND SLEEP AND SLEEP.

23:18.522 --> 23:22.024
AND THAT'S WHAT
I WANT BOTH OF YOU
TO DO RIGHT NOW.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.110
DREAM
ABOUT THOSE DREAMS.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.945
BUT DON'T
EAT TOO MANY CLOUDS,

23:26.113 --> 23:28.030
OR YOU'LL
GET STOMACHACHES.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.457
MR. INGALLS?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.126
YEAH, TOM?

23:40.293 --> 23:43.337
YOU WEREN'T FUNNING
ABOUT WETTING AND ALL?

23:43.505 --> 23:46.006
NO, I WASN'T FUNNING.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.050
AND IT WILL STOP?

23:48.218 --> 23:50.052
I GUARANTEE IT.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.596
THANKS. GOOD NIGHT.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.682
GOOD NIGHT, TOM.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.811
[DOOR CLOSES]

24:07.737 --> 24:09.947
I TELL YOU,
THAT'S QUITE A PAIR.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.907
YES, THEY ARE.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.410
AFTER THAT
WORKOUT YOU GAVE
THEM TODAY,

24:14.578 --> 24:16.328
THEY'LL SLEEP
LIKE LOGS.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.080

39:07.053 --> 39:09.346
WON'T YOU EVEN TRY?

39:23.736 --> 39:26.488
I'LL SEE
IF YOUR MA'S READY.

39:41.337 --> 39:42.754
I'M ALL READY,

39:42.922 --> 39:46.049
AND THERE'S
ONE BAG LEFT IN
THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.634
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.595
LEAVE THAT ONE THERE.
I'LL GET THEM ALL.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.516
I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.726
I'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

40:38.894 --> 40:41.396
HERE'S YOUR MONEY.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.525
A BILL OF SALE.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.028
YOU KNOW, INGALLS,

40:49.196 --> 40:51.656
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
FOR THE PAST FEW HOURS

40:51.824 --> 40:56.578
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY OF STOPPING
MY WIFE FROM LEAVING,

40:56.745 --> 41:00.790
EVERYTHING FROM
PLEADING WITH LESLIE
TO FIGHTING YOU,

41:00.958 --> 41:04.586
AND NEITHER ONE
OF THEM SEEMS
TO MAKE MUCH SENSE.

41:05.921 --> 41:10.008
YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE
ANOTHER PERSON LOVE YOU.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.802
YOU NEVER REALLY TRIED,
DID YOU?

41:16.098 --> 41:18.141
NO.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.894
NOT SINCE MICHAEL DIED.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.937
I SUPPOSE
LESLIE TOLD YOU

41:23.105 --> 41:25.106
I KILLED MY OWN SON.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.776
SHE SAID
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.

41:32.573 --> 41:35.158
IT WAS 4 YEARS AGO.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.078
BUT NO MATTER HOW
MANY YEARS AGO IT WAS,

41:39.246 --> 41:41.664
FOR ME,
IT'S ALWAYS YESTERDAY.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.294
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE

41:46.462 --> 41:48.630
IN THIS WORLD
WHO'S EVER SUFFERED?

41:48.797 --> 41:51.341
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR YOUR SYMPATHY
OR YOUR FORGIVENESS.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.468
WELL, GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO GET EITHER.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.970
YOU KNOW, FOR 4 YEARS
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN A FATHER,

41:56.138 --> 41:57.430
YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN ANYTHING.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.641
YOU GOT TWO CHILDREN
SITTING OUT THERE WHO NEED

41:59.808 --> 42:01.851
AN AWFUL LOT OF LOVE
TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.729
YOU THINK
THESE PAST 4 YEARS
HAVE BEEN EASY FOR ME?

42:04.897 --> 42:06.147
I TOLD YOU
I KILLED MY OWN SON.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.732
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD LIVE WITH THAT?

42:07.900 --> 42:09.067
AW, COME ON, HARPER.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.318
YOU'RE NOT PUNISHING
YOURSELF WITH THAT GUILT.

42:10.486 --> 42:11.444
YOU'RE PUNISHING YOUR WIFE.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.112
YOU'RE PUNISHING
YOUR CHILDREN.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.782
DESTROYING THEIR LOVE
WAS NO ACCIDENT.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.577
GET OUT.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.459
YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR WIFE.

42:28.003 --> 42:30.964
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
OF BEING ALONE.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.008
I'M NOT AFRAID OF
BEING ALONE, INGALLS.

42:34.176 --> 42:38.221
I'VE SPENT THE PAST
4 YEARS WORKING VERY
HARD AT BEING ALONE.

42:57.199 --> 43:00.159
LESLIE, COULD I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

43:00.327 --> 43:02.870
WAIT IN THE WAGON,
CHILDREN.

43:13.340 --> 43:14.257
WHAT'S WRONG?

43:14.425 --> 43:15.592
NOTHING'S WRONG.

43:15.759 --> 43:19.095
I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE.

43:23.058 --> 43:25.018
I'M NOT GOING
TO TAKE YOU.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.227
WHAT?

43:26.395 --> 43:28.521
I'M NOT GOING
TO TAKE YOU INTO TOWN.

43:28.689 --> 43:29.856
IF YOU WANT TO GO,

43:30.024 --> 43:32.066
YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE
SOMEBODY ELSE DRIVE YOU.

43:32.234 --> 43:35.069
IS IT BECAUSE
OF SOMETHING
BRET SAID TO YOU?

43:35.237 --> 43:38.114
BECAUSE HE'S IN
THERE DRUNK AND YOU
FEEL SORRY FOR HIM?

43:38.282 --> 43:40.742
HE'S NOT DRUNK,
AND I DON'T FEEL SORRY
FOR HIM.

43:40.909 --> 43:42.660
THEN WHAT IS IT?

43:44.246 --> 43:48.458
IT'S BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU
AND YOU LOVE HIM.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.668
YOU'RE WRONG.

43:50.836 --> 43:52.629
AM I?

43:54.214 --> 43:57.175
JUST LOOK AT ME AND
TELL ME YOU DON'T LOVE HIM.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.385
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

44:05.559 --> 44:08.895
LOOK AT ME AND TELL ME
YOU DON'T LOVE HIM.

44:11.398 --> 44:14.150
IF ONLY
HE WERE LIKE YOU.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.445
I--I NEED--

44:17.613 --> 44:19.530
YOU NEED SOMEONE.

44:21.659 --> 44:25.119
YOU'VE NEEDED SOMEONE
FOR A LONG TIME.

44:27.247 --> 44:31.167
BUT, LESLIE, NEEDING AND LOVING
JUST AREN'T THE SAME THING.

44:32.044 --> 44:33.753
SOME OF THE THINGS
YOU SEE IN ME

44:33.921 --> 44:36.881
ARE THE THINGS YOU USED
TO SEE IN YOUR HUSBAND.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.633
[SIGHS]

44:40.803 --> 44:42.011
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ONCE

44:42.179 --> 44:45.306
THAT A PERSON HAS
TO WORK AT BEING HAPPY?

44:45.474 --> 44:47.183
REMEMBER?

44:51.438 --> 44:54.440
I THINK YOUR HUSBAND'S
READY FOR THAT WORK.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.320
BUT YOU GOTTA
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

45:01.281 --> 45:03.783
IF ONLY
I COULD BE SURE.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.786
YOU'RE SURE YOU
LOVE HIM, AREN'T YOU?

45:08.622 --> 45:10.206
YES.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.251
AND YOU KNOW
YOUR CHILDREN DO.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.213
I KNOW.

45:19.425 --> 45:23.261
AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SURE OF?

45:30.227 --> 45:31.602
COME ON.

45:50.706 --> 45:52.790
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING?

45:54.376 --> 45:55.668
NO.

46:07.222 --> 46:10.558
I WON'T MAKE
ANY PROMISES,

46:10.726 --> 46:13.519
AND I WON'T PLEAD.

46:14.897 --> 46:17.190
BUT I WILL TRY.

46:19.401 --> 46:21.027
DEAL?

46:23.322 --> 46:24.864
DEAL.

46:32.414 --> 46:34.040
ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY OUT.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.249
WHERE'S MA?

46:35.417 --> 46:38.127
SHE'S INSIDE
WITH YOUR PA.

46:39.713 --> 46:41.088
SHE'S NOT GOING.

46:41.256 --> 46:42.924
SHE'S NOT?

46:43.091 --> 46:45.092
THAT'S RIGHT. SHE ISN'T.

46:45.260 --> 46:48.471
WHY DON'T YOU GET ON IN
THAT HOUSE AND GIVE HER A HUG?

46:48.639 --> 46:50.431
Samantha: MA! PA!

46:50.599 --> 46:54.185
OH, MR. INGALLS,
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

46:54.353 --> 46:57.063
YOU GAVE OUR PA A DREAM.

46:58.774 --> 47:01.359
AW, I DIDN'T GIVE
HIM A DREAM, BOY.

47:01.527 --> 47:04.195
I JUST KIND OF
WOKE HIM UP A
LITTLE, THAT'S ALL.

47:04.363 --> 47:08.825
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU,
MR. INGALLS. NEVER.

47:11.453 --> 47:13.538
NOR WILL I YOU.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.458
NOW GO ON.
GET IN THAT HOUSE.

47:21.296 --> 47:23.756
I LOVE YOU, CHARLES!

47:48.115 --> 47:49.490
Laura: PA GOT A LETTER

47:49.658 --> 47:52.159
FROM THE HARPERS
TWO YEARS LATER.

47:52.327 --> 47:55.663
THEY WANTED PA TO KNOW
THEY'D HAD ANOTHER CHILD--

47:55.831 --> 47:57.206
A SON.

47:57.374 --> 48:00.585
THEY NAMED HIM
CHARLES MICHAEL HARPER.
