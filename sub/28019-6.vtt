00:15.582 --> 00:16.888
Give me another.

00:17.709 --> 00:19.543
I was here.

00:19.586 --> 00:20.963
Good for you.

00:22.339 --> 00:25.070
Hey, didn't I see you outside Wichita?

00:25.114 --> 00:27.052
Fueling up off I-35?

00:28.178 --> 00:30.013
Wasn't me, amigo.

00:30.815 --> 00:32.799
- I came up 75.
- Yeah?

00:32.842 --> 00:34.340
Hauling what?

00:36.342 --> 00:37.778
None of your business.

00:37.822 --> 00:39.084
Hey.

00:39.128 --> 00:40.956
It was a friendly question.

00:42.958 --> 00:44.611
Then ask it to someone else.

00:48.398 --> 00:49.790
We got some kind of problem here?

00:49.834 --> 00:52.202
Starting to, yeah.

00:52.663 --> 00:54.230
All I asked is what you were hauling.

00:54.273 --> 00:55.706
Well...

00:57.124 --> 00:58.203
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm not answering.

00:58.247 --> 00:59.626
Hey. Boys, hey. Hey...

00:59.670 --> 01:00.932
So get out of my face.

01:07.547 --> 01:08.548
Get him.

01:08.592 --> 01:10.289
Pinche cabrÃ³n.

01:13.292 --> 01:15.642
I see you again, I'll kill you!

01:15.686 --> 01:17.993
Settle down.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.300
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

01:21.344 --> 01:22.670
I'll kill you!

01:22.714 --> 01:24.985
And you didn't know Lowell
Schroeder before that night?

01:25.957 --> 01:27.959
Never even got his name.

01:28.003 --> 01:29.265
Carlos didn't mean it.

01:29.308 --> 01:30.777
The threat.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.659
I had a temper then.

01:32.964 --> 01:34.792
It was the kind of thing that I'd say

01:34.835 --> 01:36.576
when I was... pissed.

01:36.620 --> 01:39.014
Right, but you did kill him.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.293
Yeah.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.055
Later that night.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.496
The cops had a witness
who said I came outside

01:49.540 --> 01:51.629
- and jumped him in the parking lot.
- Which meant

01:51.672 --> 01:53.196
he was making good on the death threat,

01:53.239 --> 01:54.719
which meant it was premeditated.

01:54.763 --> 01:56.329
Which is why you're on death row.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.712
And even though you
admitted to killing him,

01:58.755 --> 02:00.896
you didn't go outside looking to do it?

02:01.857 --> 02:04.337
I was a brawler then, never denied that.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.992
I was on my way back to my truck

02:07.036 --> 02:08.987
when he jumped me.

02:09.386 --> 02:13.390
I had just a little bit
too much to drink that night.

02:13.909 --> 02:15.653
And when the police came to our house

02:15.696 --> 02:17.524
the next morning for Carlos,

02:17.568 --> 02:19.657
he still had Lowell's blood on his hands.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.833
And with no evidence to prove
your side of things,

02:21.877 --> 02:24.322
- it's an open-and-shut case.
- Until now.

02:24.366 --> 02:27.360
Um, this ransom letter you mentioned
on the phone, do you have it?

02:27.404 --> 02:28.757
Yeah.

02:29.841 --> 02:32.761
Like I said, whoever sent this...

02:33.453 --> 02:36.643
said they have evidence that
can get Carlos off death row.

02:36.644 --> 02:38.080
For $500,000.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.734
"I have proof that Carlos

02:39.778 --> 02:41.344
was defending himself."

02:41.388 --> 02:43.259
Meaning he wasn't
making good on the death threat.

02:43.303 --> 02:44.870
If the killing wasn't premeditated,

02:44.913 --> 02:48.252
they can't execute him.
It's not a capital crime.

02:48.295 --> 02:50.248
$500,000. Do you have that kind of money?

02:50.292 --> 02:51.705
Nowhere close.

02:51.749 --> 02:53.182
You have any idea what
this evidence might be?

02:53.226 --> 02:54.836
No, man. No clue.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.185
But if it is true,

02:56.229 --> 02:57.622
it could save Carlos's life.

02:57.665 --> 02:59.667
And, if we can prove self-defense,

02:59.711 --> 03:01.234
maybe the charge gets dropped down

03:01.277 --> 03:03.454
to manslaughter and Carlos
gets out on time served.

03:03.497 --> 03:06.457
But if it's not real,
if it's just some criminal

03:06.500 --> 03:08.823
looking to extort us,
we wasted what little money

03:08.867 --> 03:10.765
we have left on nothing but a prayer.

03:11.258 --> 03:12.680
Stop thinking like that.

03:13.302 --> 03:15.161
This is why we found Mr. Beaumont.

03:15.204 --> 03:16.771
Let's hear what he has to say.

03:17.389 --> 03:19.382
You want to know if I think
you should buy this evidence?

03:19.426 --> 03:21.412
And you need to decide fast.

03:21.456 --> 03:24.039
'Cause there is something else.

03:24.083 --> 03:27.129
They just signed my death warrant.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.176
I'm being executed in 48 hours.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.435
Morning.

04:10.479 --> 04:11.726
Good morning.

04:12.102 --> 04:14.570
The, uh... kitchen sink's backed up.

04:14.613 --> 04:17.137
Uh, if I find a plumber,
you think you could let him in?

04:17.180 --> 04:18.922
Hmm. Depends when, sis.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.445
Got somewhere to be today.

04:20.488 --> 04:21.577
Oh, a job interview?

04:22.648 --> 04:24.152
Meeting my parole officer.

04:24.972 --> 04:26.495
Right.

04:26.538 --> 04:28.018
Okay, well, uh...

04:28.502 --> 04:30.281
don't worry about the sink.

04:33.924 --> 04:36.287
I'll see you when I get back.

04:41.249 --> 04:43.294
- Morning.
- Hey, hey, Zara. Morning.

04:43.338 --> 04:45.818
Sorry, I would've invited
you inside to wait, but...

04:45.862 --> 04:47.081
It's the maid's day off?

04:47.124 --> 04:49.427
Oh, hey, Eric. Morning.

04:49.470 --> 04:50.719
Good morning.

04:50.763 --> 04:52.651
Are you up to speed on Carlos Perez?

04:52.695 --> 04:53.957
We're on his case pro bono.

04:54.001 --> 04:55.306
Yeah, I read the police report.

04:55.350 --> 04:57.482
A bar full of people heard Carlos

04:57.526 --> 04:58.831
make that death threat.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.572
He's lost four appeals over ten years,

05:00.616 --> 05:02.096
the Supreme Court just denied him leave.

05:02.139 --> 05:03.967
So even if we do negotiate
for the evidence

05:04.011 --> 05:05.534
on the off chance
that it leads somewhere,

05:05.577 --> 05:07.971
- can we deploy it?
- It could be possible

05:07.996 --> 05:09.388
to get an emergency stay,

05:09.413 --> 05:12.155
pending a petition
for executive clemency.

05:12.180 --> 05:13.442
According to his trial history,

05:13.467 --> 05:16.091
he's changed legal counsel several times.

05:16.598 --> 05:18.503
So who's Carlos's lawyer now?

05:18.547 --> 05:20.679
Actually... his wife, Donna.

05:21.596 --> 05:23.944
Carlos had all these public defenders

05:23.969 --> 05:25.492
but none who really believed in him.

05:25.554 --> 05:27.469
So you went to law school.

05:27.512 --> 05:29.427
You mind sealing this?

05:30.021 --> 05:31.516
I'm contacting everyone
on the governor's staff

05:31.541 --> 05:33.412
in case we need to reach her.

05:34.151 --> 05:36.515
Took as many night classes
as I could and with...

05:37.247 --> 05:40.264
the help of student
loans, we made it work.

05:40.308 --> 05:41.874
And even with all that debt,
you still managed

05:41.918 --> 05:43.528
to get money for this evidence?

05:43.572 --> 05:45.008
Fourth mortgage on the house.

05:45.052 --> 05:46.923
- Wow.
- If Mr. Beaumont could get him down

05:46.967 --> 05:48.577
on price, I have about $100,000.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.883
I mean, he's very good at that.
But, Donna...

05:50.927 --> 05:52.189
You don't believe us, either.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.712
No, it's not that.

05:53.756 --> 05:56.628
But the odds of new evidence
changing anything, it's...

05:56.672 --> 05:58.282
You sound just like Carlos.

05:58.326 --> 05:59.588
Afraid to hope.

05:59.631 --> 06:01.553
Like he doesn't deserve it.

06:02.373 --> 06:03.680
Look...

06:04.727 --> 06:07.817
I know that he made some
mistakes when he was younger,

06:08.477 --> 06:09.971
but he is a good man.

06:10.015 --> 06:11.730
He's been a father to his son,

06:11.774 --> 06:13.339
got his GED.

06:13.382 --> 06:14.798
They write each other every day.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.943
He helps him with his homework.

06:18.476 --> 06:20.130
If Carlos dies...

06:23.516 --> 06:24.497
It's him.

06:27.181 --> 06:28.747
Hello?

06:28.791 --> 06:30.337
Do you have the $500,000?

06:30.380 --> 06:31.837
First, we have a few questions.

06:31.881 --> 06:33.404
Don't be alarmed,
my name is Eric Beaumont.

06:33.448 --> 06:34.927
I'm a private negotiator hired by Donna.

06:34.971 --> 06:36.842
They think I'm lying? Then don't pay.

06:36.886 --> 06:38.517
Nobody's saying that.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.110
However, you're asking
for a great deal of money.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.240
How can we decide to pay if we don't know

06:43.265 --> 06:45.528
specifically what evidence you have?

06:45.590 --> 06:47.987
What I have shows the man on death row

06:48.012 --> 06:50.002
didn't start the fight
outside the bar that night.

06:50.003 --> 06:51.853
How did you come to possess
this evidence?

06:52.017 --> 06:54.397
Let's just say I have it
because I'm a Good Samaritan...

06:54.654 --> 06:56.090
who's done answering questions.

06:56.134 --> 06:57.918
All I'm trying to do is
gather enough information

06:57.962 --> 06:59.441
to recommend to my client
that she pay you.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.738
You help me do that,
and you'll get your money.

07:05.970 --> 07:07.005
Sir?

07:07.048 --> 07:09.930
Watch the tape
from October 3... carefully.

07:09.974 --> 07:12.019
I'll call back in six hours.

07:12.063 --> 07:13.542
You said that he would get his money.

07:13.586 --> 07:16.154
- I don't have anywhere near the 500.
- I know. I know.

07:16.197 --> 07:18.591
But if he's emotionally invested
in this deal, he's more likely

07:18.634 --> 07:20.375
- to take less.
- He's volatile.

07:20.419 --> 07:22.336
Coming forward, wasn't easy for him.

07:22.361 --> 07:24.578
Maybe because hiding evidence is
an obstruction of justice.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.642
If he's been sitting on whatever this is,

07:26.686 --> 07:28.818
he probably wants to stay out of trouble.

07:28.862 --> 07:31.038
You know what he meant by
"the tape of October 3"?

07:31.082 --> 07:32.779
It was the night of the murder.

07:32.822 --> 07:34.724
He must mean the security footage.

07:34.768 --> 07:36.609
The bar only had one cam in 2009,

07:36.652 --> 07:37.827
and-and I've... I've looked at it.

07:37.871 --> 07:38.959
There's nothing to see.

07:39.003 --> 07:40.308
Oh, he's saying there is.

07:40.973 --> 07:42.388
Get ahold of Zara and Cynthia.

07:42.432 --> 07:43.572
When they land,
they should go to that bar

07:43.616 --> 07:45.953
and make sure all the tapes
were handed over.

07:45.996 --> 07:48.142
We'll go over the original tapes
in State's evidence.

07:48.186 --> 07:49.396
You don't have them, do you, Donna?

07:49.421 --> 07:52.302
No. Not anymore, and given

07:52.327 --> 07:54.459
the district attorney is Heidi Ambrose,

07:54.484 --> 07:55.789
it's not gonna be easy to access them.

07:57.264 --> 07:58.266
Okay.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.588
Your staff

07:59.632 --> 08:01.199
explained why we're asking
for State's evidence

08:01.242 --> 08:02.374
against Carlos Perez?

08:02.417 --> 08:03.766
Yes, but unfortunately,

08:03.810 --> 08:05.470
there's nothing to be found
which will help him.

08:05.495 --> 08:06.956
And given his numerous legal proceedings,

08:06.981 --> 08:09.692
Mr. Perez has had plenty of
chances to review that evidence.

08:09.772 --> 08:11.209
Due process has been followed.

08:11.234 --> 08:12.540
We don't dispute that.

08:12.601 --> 08:13.994
I'm a negotiator, Ms. Ambrose,

08:14.038 --> 08:16.127
looking for information
to help us decide whether

08:16.170 --> 08:17.563
to negotiate. That's all.

08:17.588 --> 08:19.721
We didn't come here to make a legal plea.

08:19.782 --> 08:22.002
You came here to make an emotional plea?

08:22.046 --> 08:25.005
Carlos is being executed tomorrow.

08:25.049 --> 08:26.398
This is the last chance he'll have.

08:26.441 --> 08:29.009
Vultures are drawn
to last-minute death row cases.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.968
I see it all the time.

08:31.536 --> 08:32.881
Selling false hope,

08:33.371 --> 08:35.150
making families relive a nightmare.

08:35.176 --> 08:36.823
If you're worried that
we have some kind of

08:36.849 --> 08:38.356
financial stake in
this, you should know...

08:38.437 --> 08:39.797
Of course I am.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.239
Donna Perez might be married to a killer,

08:41.282 --> 08:43.197
but I don't want to see her defrauded.

08:43.241 --> 08:44.503
Nor the victim's father,

08:44.546 --> 08:46.113
who attended all the sentencing hearings

08:46.157 --> 08:47.549
demanding Carlos's execution.

08:47.593 --> 08:50.056
The people I serve get
to be emotional, not me.

08:50.099 --> 08:51.640
All I can do is follow the law,

08:51.684 --> 08:54.295
and according to the law, Carlos
deserves the death penalty.

08:54.339 --> 08:56.341
I'm sorry. This meeting's over.

08:56.384 --> 08:57.820
All right, you mentioned
the victim's father.

08:57.864 --> 08:59.735
He had standing
to speak at those hearings?

08:59.779 --> 09:02.042
He did. Victims' families
have participation

09:02.086 --> 09:04.229
and consultation rights,
which I take seriously.

09:04.272 --> 09:05.929
Oh, you don't have
to let us see those tapes,

09:05.973 --> 09:07.069
but you do have discretion.

09:07.112 --> 09:09.180
What if I get
the victim's father to consent?

09:09.223 --> 09:11.084
He's never gonna agree to that.
He's been clamoring

09:11.109 --> 09:13.905
for your client's death
for ten years now, loudly.

09:13.967 --> 09:17.144
Well, if he says no, then, so be it.

09:20.222 --> 09:21.876
Okay.

09:24.547 --> 09:26.893
Well, if she can't be swayed by emotion,

09:26.936 --> 09:28.982
we need to find someone who can.

09:40.105 --> 09:42.865
The owner's positive
they turned over all their tapes

09:42.909 --> 09:44.128
to police at the time.

09:44.171 --> 09:46.956
Given where the lone
security camera was in 2009,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.480
it wouldn't even have shown the murder.

09:48.523 --> 09:49.916
We're in view of it now,

09:49.959 --> 09:51.787
and Lowell's body was found
around the corner.

09:51.831 --> 09:53.833
Then it's no wonder the
cam footage wasn't part

09:53.876 --> 09:55.182
of anyone's case.

09:55.226 --> 09:57.141
Do you think we're being played?

09:57.184 --> 09:58.533
Possibly.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.682
- Eric?
- Uh, no. Just give me a sec.

10:02.737 --> 10:03.886
- Hey.
- Sure.

10:04.635 --> 10:05.801
Hey.

10:05.845 --> 10:08.717
My, uh, parole officer wants to meet you.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.634
Now? I'm in St. Louis.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.680
No. I'm supposed to set a time.

10:14.723 --> 10:16.899
Think you could come with me
next Tuesday at 2:00?

10:17.308 --> 10:18.315
I'll try.

10:18.340 --> 10:20.058
She also wants references.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.765
- Think you could ask your boss?
- Ask my boss for a reference on you?

10:22.790 --> 10:23.873
On you.

10:24.603 --> 10:26.959
She needs to know I'm
in a stable living condition,

10:26.984 --> 10:28.327
that sort of thing.

10:30.522 --> 10:33.916
Uh... Tyler, I might not even be in town

10:33.941 --> 10:35.618
on Tuesday.

10:37.529 --> 10:39.096
They don't know about me, do they?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.228
- The people you work with.
- It's complicated.

10:41.272 --> 10:42.664
Look, you lived your life.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.710
I never questioned that. But now?

10:44.753 --> 10:47.278
I figured you'd at least have my back.

10:47.303 --> 10:50.133
Tyler... I can't do this now.

10:52.674 --> 10:54.343
You drive?

10:54.387 --> 10:57.375
Used to. Logistics supervisor now.

10:57.418 --> 10:58.898
Must be tough.

10:58.941 --> 11:00.685
Life on the road.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.274
You said you had a question
about my son's case.

11:03.299 --> 11:05.015
Why not get to it?

11:05.526 --> 11:07.167
Lowell drove here, too?

11:07.567 --> 11:08.943
For a time.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.572
I'd like to say
that he came to it honestly,

11:12.597 --> 11:16.042
but... Lowell wasn't much for, uh,

11:16.067 --> 11:17.402
an honest day's work.

11:17.482 --> 11:20.485
You're aware the death warrant
has been signed on Carlos Perez.

11:20.528 --> 11:22.181
Mm-hmm.

11:22.472 --> 11:25.054
We're here because an anonymous
person has come forward

11:25.079 --> 11:26.428
with new evidence.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.107
Someone what?

11:28.132 --> 11:31.942
You got to be... and you thought
that I would help you?

11:32.509 --> 11:34.281
Everything okay in here, boss?

11:34.761 --> 11:37.213
These men are asking about my boy.

11:37.256 --> 11:38.633
Oh, yeah.

11:39.057 --> 11:40.641
You want me to show 'em out?

11:40.684 --> 11:41.854
Mr. Schroeder.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.232
We don't know what this new evidence is.

11:45.275 --> 11:47.773
In fact, there is a very good
chance it isn't even real,

11:47.816 --> 11:50.254
and our job is to prove that.

11:50.297 --> 11:53.134
Now, to do this, we'd like
to review the State's case

11:53.159 --> 11:54.527
against Carlos.

11:54.590 --> 11:56.157
But, look, we're not...

11:57.261 --> 12:00.220
we're not here to tell you

12:00.264 --> 12:01.221
the way it is.

12:01.265 --> 12:02.831
We're here to ask your permission.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.074
You have all the power.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.319
If you don't want us
pursuing it, we won't.

12:08.342 --> 12:09.474
Get back to work.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.266
You got to understand, I am counting

12:13.310 --> 12:15.931
the seconds to this execution.

12:15.975 --> 12:19.040
And every time another appeal
is dredged up...

12:19.065 --> 12:21.135
You need closure. We get that.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.852
I used to be FBI, and, uh,

12:24.227 --> 12:27.508
one year we caught a man accused
of killing his wife.

12:27.552 --> 12:29.945
It was a... it was a gruesome murder.

12:29.970 --> 12:31.014
He got the death penalty,

12:31.039 --> 12:34.434
but two years after he was executed,

12:34.459 --> 12:36.548
it turned out the forensic
evidence was wrong.

12:36.648 --> 12:38.084
We had the wrong man,

12:38.109 --> 12:41.307
and the victim's family
had justice stolen from them.

12:41.332 --> 12:43.314
We're not here to prove you wrong.

12:43.339 --> 12:44.427
We're here to prove you right,

12:44.452 --> 12:47.368
so when this ends, it ends for good.

12:49.272 --> 12:51.164
- Find anything?
- Nothing to find.

12:51.189 --> 12:53.356
All the security tapes
were handed over at the time.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.518
- Our luck was better.
- The D.A. played ball?

12:55.562 --> 12:57.428
Well, it took some convincing.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.790
Get over to the State's evidence
room and watch that footage.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.020
You're not coming?

13:01.063 --> 13:02.682
Uh, no, we're going back to Donna's.

13:02.707 --> 13:05.067
Our Good Samaritan is calling
in less than an hour.

13:05.343 --> 13:06.823
Got it.

13:16.573 --> 13:18.163
12:01 a.m., time of the murder,

13:18.188 --> 13:19.867
and there's nothing to see on this tape.

13:19.892 --> 13:22.042
Problem is, anyone leaving
the bar and heading away

13:22.067 --> 13:23.943
from the camera angle,
wouldn't be seen anyway.

13:23.968 --> 13:25.010
Right.

13:25.035 --> 13:26.780
So, if Carlos left undetected,

13:26.805 --> 13:28.833
what is this footage meant to be proving?

13:30.251 --> 13:33.091
We're not watching it
for evidence of the crime.

13:33.135 --> 13:35.732
We're watching it to prove
our Samaritan's credibility.

13:35.757 --> 13:36.773
Mm.

13:36.798 --> 13:40.297
What did he say?
Watch the tape carefully.

13:42.609 --> 13:43.959
Scan through the whole day again.

13:44.933 --> 13:46.365
Mm-hmm.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.396
How long until he calls?

13:50.992 --> 13:53.650
Two minutes.

13:55.461 --> 13:56.636
Zara, tell me you have something.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.464
Eric? It rains on the tape.

13:58.508 --> 14:00.466
We checked the weather. It didn't rain

14:00.510 --> 14:01.641
once that day.

14:02.533 --> 14:04.209
Police had the wrong tape.

14:05.252 --> 14:08.091
Somehow it was mistaken or... swapped

14:08.116 --> 14:09.469
for footage from another day.

14:09.494 --> 14:11.577
Which means neither the State
nor the defense

14:11.602 --> 14:13.218
has ever seen the right tape.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.784
And if our Samaritan knows this,

14:14.827 --> 14:16.656
he just wanted us to know
he has the right tape.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.813
And possibly new evidence
from the night of the murder.

14:18.838 --> 14:20.259
How could I...

14:21.511 --> 14:23.805
why did I not look for that before?

14:24.516 --> 14:25.665
We need to pay.

14:29.523 --> 14:31.323
So... did you watch the tape?

14:31.367 --> 14:32.498
Do you have the real security footage

14:32.542 --> 14:33.658
from the night of the murder?

14:33.702 --> 14:34.838
Do we have a deal?

14:34.882 --> 14:36.328
We want to move forward.

14:36.372 --> 14:38.277
But not at $500,000.

14:38.694 --> 14:40.230
We can offer you $90,000.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.620
You strung me along.
I'm sticking my neck out here.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.802
We appreciate that, but Donna
only has what she has.

14:44.808 --> 14:46.345
$90,000 will bankrupt her.

14:46.370 --> 14:48.068
And if I say the deal's off?

14:48.093 --> 14:49.766
I'd remind you that, as of tomorrow,

14:49.791 --> 14:52.427
that $90,000 tape you're
sitting on loses all its value.

14:52.452 --> 14:55.044
Yeah, and your client loses his life.

14:55.691 --> 14:58.179
If that's what you want,
then that is what will happen.

14:58.881 --> 15:00.309
But I don't think it is.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.756
Fine. But we don't meet in person.

15:03.799 --> 15:05.309
I'll text you a drop location.

15:05.353 --> 15:06.989
After I count the money,
I'll transfer the file.

15:10.797 --> 15:13.438
That clicking noise.
Do you guys hear that?

15:14.897 --> 15:16.416
There, again.

15:17.587 --> 15:21.612
And I'm picking up extra
bandwidth on Donna's cell.

15:22.697 --> 15:24.490
Somebody's tapping your phone.

15:33.997 --> 15:36.130
So, this is it. This is the real tape.

15:36.753 --> 15:38.089
That's Carlos's rig,

15:38.132 --> 15:39.873
which we couldn't see
on the original tape,

15:39.898 --> 15:41.770
so we assumed
that he parked it out of view.

15:41.795 --> 15:42.970
It looks like Carlos

15:42.995 --> 15:45.128
is on his way home when he finds Lowell.

15:45.226 --> 15:47.054
Is he breaking into his truck?

15:47.098 --> 15:48.925
Looks like that, anyway.

15:48.969 --> 15:51.711
Carlos was on his way
home, just like he always said.

15:51.736 --> 15:52.868
They had words.

15:52.893 --> 15:54.112
Things escalated from there.

15:54.137 --> 15:56.965
Meaning the reason
they started fighting again

15:56.990 --> 15:59.558
was because Carlos was trying
to stop Lowell from robbing him.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.150
This disproves premeditation.

16:01.175 --> 16:03.699
If I can get in front of
a judge, I can get a stay.

16:03.853 --> 16:05.626
This tape could save Carlos's life.

16:05.651 --> 16:07.131
Will you come with me to the courthouse?

16:07.379 --> 16:09.163
I might need some backup with the D.A.

16:09.207 --> 16:10.292
You got it.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.513
Great.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.562
Go see if the new footage
jogs Carlos's memory.

16:16.587 --> 16:18.468
Maybe there's more to what
Lowell was doing that night

16:18.493 --> 16:19.545
we should know about.

16:19.991 --> 16:21.340
Speaking of the D.A.,

16:21.365 --> 16:22.888
do you think she's the one listening in?

16:22.913 --> 16:24.132
With an election coming up,

16:24.157 --> 16:26.464
the politics of a last-second
death row appeal

16:26.489 --> 16:28.883
doesn't exactly make for good PR.

16:28.908 --> 16:30.431
Did you figure out
how the phone was tapped?

16:30.456 --> 16:32.474
It was hacked remotely. We found an app

16:32.499 --> 16:34.980
running in the background
sending packets of audio data

16:35.005 --> 16:36.224
to a remote IP address.

16:36.249 --> 16:38.225
If we can trace and
unmask the IP address,

16:38.250 --> 16:40.191
we can learn
where the calls are being sent.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.347
Okay, good.

16:41.372 --> 16:43.152
- Stay on it.
- Yeah.

16:44.109 --> 16:45.530
Okay.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.856
I remember Lowell asking about my haul,

16:49.881 --> 16:52.362
but not breaking into my rig.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.563
This is why we started scrapping again?

16:54.643 --> 16:56.819
Donna's managed to get
an emergency hearing

16:56.844 --> 16:58.454
with a judge to argue just that.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.091
So, if there is anything else
coming back to you...

17:01.092 --> 17:03.311
The video doesn't show
who threw the first punch.

17:03.336 --> 17:06.034
Yeah, but it goes to motivation, Carlos.

17:06.116 --> 17:07.464
It's key to first-degree murder.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.536
A few months ago, Donna was convinced

17:09.560 --> 17:11.172
the Supreme Court will hear our case.

17:11.251 --> 17:12.534
When they said no,

17:12.559 --> 17:14.147
she almost didn't bounce back.

17:14.173 --> 17:15.869
I can't have her
going through that again.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.084
And she spent 90 grand on this?

17:18.127 --> 17:20.478
You know the kind of hole
my family's already in

17:20.521 --> 17:21.523
because of me?

17:22.132 --> 17:24.134
Donna should be thinking
about the future.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.700
She is.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.571
Just one that includes you.

17:30.749 --> 17:34.144
- I have made my decision, Ms. Perez.
- Yes, I know, Your Honor.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.276
If I could just have
a few more minutes to explain.

17:36.581 --> 17:38.148
You opposed the motion.

17:38.499 --> 17:40.106
Carlos is still being executed.

17:40.150 --> 17:41.412
He is.

17:41.455 --> 17:43.109
Look, I realize
the new footage lacks audio

17:43.153 --> 17:45.185
and can be read in several ways,
but doesn't it concern you

17:45.210 --> 17:46.863
that video evidence has been mishandled?

17:46.888 --> 17:48.934
It was sloppy police work,
and that's unfortunate,

17:48.959 --> 17:50.961
but the judge and I agree
to what you've just articulated.

17:51.161 --> 17:52.617
The tape proves nothing.

17:52.642 --> 17:54.296
Well, except potential
obstruction of justice,

17:54.321 --> 17:55.757
which may be ongoing.

17:55.948 --> 17:57.743
We've just learned that
Donna's phone is being tapped.

17:57.768 --> 17:59.437
She should file a police report.

17:59.932 --> 18:01.238
Well, she plans to.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.435
Mr. Beaumont, these are the facts.

18:03.478 --> 18:05.479
Carlos Perez committed violent crimes

18:05.504 --> 18:08.376
at ages 15, 20,
and for a final time at age 26

18:08.401 --> 18:09.663
when he vowed that Lowell Schroeder

18:09.688 --> 18:11.038
would die at his hands,

18:11.063 --> 18:13.022
only to make good
on that promise an hour later.

18:13.139 --> 18:15.359
Now, you're opposed to the death penalty.

18:15.402 --> 18:17.143
Even if you witnessed
Carlos commit this crime

18:17.187 --> 18:18.333
with your own eyes, you wouldn't think

18:18.358 --> 18:19.954
he deserves to die for it.
Tell me I'm wrong about that.

18:19.979 --> 18:21.999
- You're not.
- I respect that perspective.

18:22.024 --> 18:23.878
I'd defend your right to express it,

18:23.976 --> 18:25.847
but it doesn't change the law.

18:25.891 --> 18:27.458
And unfortunately, all you've done

18:27.501 --> 18:31.070
is enable a scam artist
and falsely raise Carlos's hope.

18:41.211 --> 18:43.169
Evidence was tampered with.

18:43.194 --> 18:45.326
- Why would she ignore that?
- I don't know.

18:45.351 --> 18:46.961
Gather whatever information you can

18:46.986 --> 18:48.553
on prosecutor Heidi Ambrose.

18:48.653 --> 18:50.524
My gut tells me this isn't over.

18:50.568 --> 18:52.526
What did our Samaritan say on that call?

18:52.570 --> 18:54.702
"I'm sticking my neck out here."

18:54.727 --> 18:56.642
Now, he had that tape
because he's complicit,

18:56.704 --> 18:58.184
most likely with Lowell,

18:58.209 --> 19:00.254
who obviously meant
to rob Carlos that night.

19:00.279 --> 19:01.758
Now, he may have even witnessed
their fight.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.016
He's afraid of implicating
himself in a robbery,

19:04.041 --> 19:05.391
which is why he stayed anonymous.

19:05.416 --> 19:07.107
But he held on to this tape
all these years

19:07.132 --> 19:09.492
- because he's torn.
- And when Carlos lost his final appeal,

19:09.517 --> 19:11.516
he spoke up out of what?

19:11.632 --> 19:13.373
- Guilt?
- Why was it so easy

19:13.417 --> 19:16.420
- to get him so far down on price?
- Huh.

19:16.463 --> 19:18.291
His motivation is actually to help.

19:18.316 --> 19:19.695
Then why ask for money at all?

19:19.720 --> 19:21.822
I don't know that yet, but either way,

19:21.847 --> 19:23.501
we're dealing with a criminal
with a conscience.

19:23.601 --> 19:24.814
Okay.

19:25.342 --> 19:26.647
So now what?

19:26.691 --> 19:29.955
We draw him out, get him on the record.

19:29.998 --> 19:31.826
Now, he wasn't blocking his number,

19:31.870 --> 19:34.031
which means he's been calling
from a drop phone.

19:34.829 --> 19:36.659
Let's hope he still has it.

19:55.372 --> 19:56.982
You have one new message.

19:57.025 --> 19:58.288
I know you stuck your neck out

19:58.331 --> 20:00.377
because you didn't want Carlos to die,

20:00.420 --> 20:02.466
but what you tried hasn't worked,

20:02.509 --> 20:03.858
and we need your help.

20:21.224 --> 20:23.226
How long do we wait
before trying him again?

20:23.251 --> 20:24.266
Okay, you need to trust me.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.977
Pushing too hard can backfire.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.037
Hey. We were able to trace the IP address

20:29.062 --> 20:30.953
of where the audio data
from Donna's phones

20:30.978 --> 20:32.414
- are being sent.
- Does that mean we have

20:32.439 --> 20:34.136
a physical location on whoever's
tapping Donna's calls?

20:34.237 --> 20:36.616
We do. And it's not the D.A.
who's been listening in.

20:36.659 --> 20:38.332
Her calls are being sent to the company

20:38.357 --> 20:40.442
where Eddie Schroeder works.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.767
- The victim's father.
- Yeah, and all of this

20:42.792 --> 20:44.577
has been happening since around the time

20:44.602 --> 20:45.908
Carlos lost his last appeal.

20:48.773 --> 20:50.149
It's our Samaritan.

20:50.174 --> 20:53.133
He won't meet tonight, but he
can do tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.

20:53.491 --> 20:55.738
That's ten hours before the execution.

20:59.653 --> 21:00.959
Where's Cynthia?

21:01.577 --> 21:05.790
Oh, she, um, she said
she needed some air.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.836
Okay.

21:17.932 --> 21:19.369
Hello.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.731
Hello?

21:20.774 --> 21:22.139
You were right.

21:23.982 --> 21:26.027
I wasn't there for you.

21:27.594 --> 21:29.146
I didn't know how to be.

21:32.319 --> 21:34.985
Instead of convincing myself
of that fact...

21:36.512 --> 21:39.632
...I just convinced myself
there was nothing I could do.

21:39.657 --> 21:41.075
You did what you had to do.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.576
You did call one night, needing help.

21:44.601 --> 21:46.386
Four years ago.

21:46.787 --> 21:49.189
You'd been in a fight,
you were in the infirmary,

21:49.214 --> 21:50.650
and you sounded terrible.

21:50.675 --> 21:52.024
Yeah, I remember.

21:55.261 --> 21:58.569
Yeah, well, I...
I didn't know what to say.

21:58.884 --> 22:02.063
I have no idea how
you managed to keep going.

22:05.596 --> 22:09.339
Well, there were things I... I'd...

22:09.364 --> 22:11.627
there were things I've done,
things I wasn't too proud of.

22:11.652 --> 22:13.175
Well, it's not your fault.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.462
You were just protecting yourself.

22:14.487 --> 22:16.485
I'm not talking about that.

22:20.296 --> 22:21.907
I meant while I...

22:24.088 --> 22:26.221
I meant when I was inside.

22:26.829 --> 22:28.372
Things I had to do

22:29.085 --> 22:30.499
to stay alive.

22:38.273 --> 22:41.320
It, it didn't matter
what you said to me that night.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.263
Hearing your voice reminded me that

22:45.411 --> 22:49.067
there was once a time when I was,

22:49.110 --> 22:50.936
I wasn't that guy who did those things.

22:51.293 --> 22:54.296
That if I could stay alive,
if I could make it through,

22:54.690 --> 22:56.984
I didn't have to be that guy ever again.

23:01.035 --> 23:02.448
Thank you, Tyler.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.658
I'll see you soon.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.145
Bye.

23:41.946 --> 23:43.697
All right, don't come any closer.

23:44.949 --> 23:46.700
Can you give us your name?

23:46.725 --> 23:48.727
First name at least,
so we know what to call you.

23:50.476 --> 23:51.956
Jeremy.

23:52.609 --> 23:54.393
Thank you for coming, Jeremy.

23:54.792 --> 23:56.439
Look, I don't know
what you guys want from me.

23:56.482 --> 23:57.570
I've already done all I can.

23:57.614 --> 23:59.255
Then why did you agree to meet?

24:00.530 --> 24:02.216
'Cause it's eating at you.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.838
You don't believe that
Carlos deserves to die.

24:04.882 --> 24:06.144
Neither do we.

24:06.187 --> 24:08.291
We think you were involved in a robbery

24:08.316 --> 24:09.535
the night of the murder
and you're worried

24:09.560 --> 24:11.214
- about getting caught.
- But if we can get you

24:11.239 --> 24:14.910
immunity on that,
will you talk to the D.A.?

24:15.813 --> 24:18.069
Because your testimony
can stop this execution.

24:18.112 --> 24:20.071
You don't understand, guys.

24:20.114 --> 24:21.899
If I come forward,
immunity on the robbery

24:21.942 --> 24:23.509
is not gonna help me.

24:23.553 --> 24:26.757
You're implicated in something
bigger than just a robbery.

24:26.782 --> 24:28.425
You're implicated in the murder.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.469
I didn't kill Lowell.

24:30.494 --> 24:32.413
But you know who did,
and it wasn't Carlos.

24:33.563 --> 24:35.791
Carlos shouldn't even be in jail.

24:36.609 --> 24:39.211
If he dies today, it'll be for
a crime someone else committed.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.026
You said Carlos didn't kill Lowell,

24:50.069 --> 24:52.766
but he admitted it.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.366
He had a hell of a lot
to drink that night.

25:04.801 --> 25:06.196
His memory is faulty.

25:06.318 --> 25:08.658
They did fight again,
but Carlos left Lowell alive

25:08.683 --> 25:09.728
and breathing.

25:12.357 --> 25:13.701
When we found Lowell,

25:13.744 --> 25:14.872
he was awake.

25:15.558 --> 25:18.083
Where were you five minutes ago?

25:21.249 --> 25:23.464
By the time I realized
he'd come to kill him...

25:25.299 --> 25:26.474
it was done.

25:26.499 --> 25:27.606
Who?

25:27.631 --> 25:29.328
Somebody you stole from?

25:29.353 --> 25:30.659
You were robbing trucks with Lowell.

25:30.951 --> 25:32.385
- That's why he was killed?
- Look,

25:32.410 --> 25:38.375
all you need to know is it
wasn't me and it wasn't Carlos.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.271
Then, someone you were working with.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.150
Someone you're still afraid of.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.778
We had a good thing going.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.072
Lowell was a loudmouth.

25:48.260 --> 25:50.871
Picking bar fights, not being careful.

25:50.896 --> 25:52.785
He was gonna get us caught.

25:53.867 --> 25:55.825
But I wasn't the one
who thought he needed to die.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.547
But you did swap the security tape

25:57.572 --> 25:59.879
with one from another day to cover it up.

25:59.904 --> 26:02.515
And Carlos was made to take
the fall for Lowell's death,

26:02.540 --> 26:05.255
given his public threat
earlier that night.

26:06.391 --> 26:10.046
Jeremy, Donna's phone's being tapped,

26:10.090 --> 26:11.688
and we don't know who's been listening,

26:11.732 --> 26:14.681
but someone heard you
sell us that evidence.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.140
It's not safe for you
to go back to your place.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.055
You should stay with us.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.312
You just want me on the record.

26:21.386 --> 26:23.564
Get me immunity, or no deal.

26:23.589 --> 26:25.849
No, Oliver's right. You
need to take precautions.

26:25.874 --> 26:27.257
You don't think I know that?

26:27.282 --> 26:28.737
I'm leaving town at 3:00.

26:29.576 --> 26:31.115
I'll stop by here then.

26:31.979 --> 26:35.156
If you have a deal... we'll see.

26:35.533 --> 26:36.954
Otherwise...

26:47.040 --> 26:49.453
Immunity on accessory to murder?

26:49.497 --> 26:50.890
He's afraid.

26:50.934 --> 26:52.784
Now, he wants immunity
but he needs protection.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.498
Protection from the real killer.

26:54.541 --> 26:57.406
If we can figure out who
that is, we can save Carlos.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.052
You said Eddie Schroeder,
the victim's father,

26:59.096 --> 27:00.575
was the one listening to Donna's calls.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.617
Oh, you don't think
he killed his own son?

27:02.618 --> 27:05.185
No. Remember what he said about Lowell?

27:05.649 --> 27:07.847
That his son wasn't much
for an honest day's work?

27:07.872 --> 27:10.501
You think Eddie
knew Lowell was robbing trucks?

27:10.526 --> 27:12.252
He knew his kid was up to something.

27:12.352 --> 27:13.869
If Eddie had context

27:13.894 --> 27:16.370
of what his son was up to,
who he was working with,

27:16.952 --> 27:18.851
maybe that leads us to the real killer.

27:18.895 --> 27:20.331
Let's go find out.

27:20.374 --> 27:22.749
Carlos didn't kill him?

27:24.051 --> 27:25.227
No.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.730
They fought,
like you always said, Carlos,

27:27.773 --> 27:30.036
but when you left, Lowell was alive.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.386
We're looking for the man who killed him.

27:33.505 --> 27:35.564
There's still time. I
can take this to the D.A.,

27:35.607 --> 27:37.435
I can ask about immunity.

27:37.478 --> 27:40.264
Don't. Don't try for immunity,

27:40.307 --> 27:42.396
don't talk to the D.A.,
don't do anything.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.181
Carlos, are you not listening to her?

27:44.224 --> 27:45.647
You didn't do it.

27:46.857 --> 27:48.185
You have any proof?

27:48.228 --> 27:50.317
Yes. The word of the witness.

27:50.361 --> 27:51.667
You really think that matters?

27:54.656 --> 27:57.411
Ten years we've been through this.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.066
Since when has the truth mattered?

28:00.110 --> 28:01.925
Baby, please...

28:01.969 --> 28:03.679
I can't take it anymore.

28:04.666 --> 28:07.726
Whether I killed him or not,

28:07.770 --> 28:09.336
I'm done.

28:09.380 --> 28:13.514
It's cruel for this to come out
now, Carlos, I get that.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.344
But you didn't kill him.

28:16.801 --> 28:19.282
Don't let them make you
into the man who did.

28:34.971 --> 28:36.712
The tape clearly shows your son

28:36.737 --> 28:38.659
breaking into Carlos's truck.

28:40.494 --> 28:42.456
If your son was mixed up
in something, you should...

28:42.500 --> 28:45.111
So that's what this is about for you?

28:45.155 --> 28:47.223
Dragging my son's name through the mud?

28:47.267 --> 28:50.987
No, but, Eddie, tapping Donna's calls...

28:51.030 --> 28:52.808
I'm not tapping anyone's calls.

28:52.833 --> 28:54.928
We promised you closure.
We're still offering that,

28:54.953 --> 28:56.737
but you need to tell us
what else you know.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.125
Did my son usually go out
looking for trouble?

28:59.169 --> 29:02.433
Yes, and I told the cops
the truth about him.

29:02.476 --> 29:03.956
They said that

29:04.309 --> 29:06.655
Lowell's death wasn't his fault.

29:06.698 --> 29:10.659
Now you say it was, and that's
supposed to give me closure?

29:10.702 --> 29:12.138
I'm not saying your son deserved to die.

29:12.182 --> 29:13.357
I'm saying you deserve to know the truth

29:13.400 --> 29:15.141
about who killed him.

29:15.185 --> 29:17.143
Let us make that happen.

29:17.187 --> 29:19.571
They weren't robbing trucks,
him and his buddies,

29:19.615 --> 29:20.973
not the way that you think.

29:21.702 --> 29:24.673
If Lowell broke into a truck,
it was just to suss out

29:24.716 --> 29:26.675
a good, good haul.

29:26.718 --> 29:28.677
You know, televisions, copper wiring,

29:28.720 --> 29:30.154
whatever was easy to flip.

29:30.198 --> 29:31.923
- Mm-hmm.
- And then they would

29:31.967 --> 29:33.943
sell that information to someone

29:33.986 --> 29:37.217
who would hijack the rig
and steal the cargo.

29:38.719 --> 29:43.343
When I found out about it,
he promised to quit.

29:43.387 --> 29:44.823
And I was dumb enough to believe him.

29:44.848 --> 29:47.144
Lowell had two accomplices.

29:47.739 --> 29:49.001
Could one of them work here?

29:49.563 --> 29:51.743
An ex-colleague? Because the audio

29:51.787 --> 29:53.745
from Donna's phone
is being sent to this address,

29:53.789 --> 29:57.053
and that, that can't be a coincidence.

29:58.949 --> 30:00.752
This man betrayed and murdered your son

30:00.777 --> 30:02.866
and is now tapping Donna's phone to stop

30:02.928 --> 30:05.104
the truth from coming out.

30:05.787 --> 30:07.628
Dale.

30:07.672 --> 30:09.848
Dale McIntosh.

30:09.892 --> 30:12.164
Actually, he was here yesterday
when we met.

30:12.208 --> 30:13.547
God,

30:13.591 --> 30:15.381
I always knew he was a lowlife,

30:15.425 --> 30:16.923
but I never thought...

30:19.466 --> 30:20.685
Did Donna speak to the D.A.?

30:20.729 --> 30:21.730
Yeah, she won't promise

30:21.773 --> 30:23.383
anything as far as immunity goes,

30:23.427 --> 30:25.516
but if we bring Jeremy in, she'll listen

30:25.559 --> 30:28.214
- to what he has to say.
- All right. That'll have to do.

30:28.258 --> 30:31.043
Dale's not here, but we have his address.

30:31.087 --> 30:32.439
Okay.

30:57.678 --> 30:58.941
Hello?

30:58.984 --> 31:00.856
It's 3:00. You said
you'd meet us back here.

31:00.899 --> 31:03.386
I said I might. I had to grab
some things at home first.

31:03.411 --> 31:05.065
You can't be at your place.

31:05.090 --> 31:08.517
Your old partner, Dale McIntosh,
he's the one who killed Lowell.

31:09.186 --> 31:10.366
How did you know that?

31:10.391 --> 31:12.175
He's the one who's been
tapping Donna's calls.

31:12.868 --> 31:14.304
He knows you're selling us that footage,

31:14.347 --> 31:16.001
which means he knows
you're betraying him.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.699
Now, we're trying to track him
down, but you need to leave now.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.527
You are not safe there.

31:20.571 --> 31:22.399
Okay. I'm coming to meet you.

31:30.914 --> 31:33.018
That kid is the best.

31:33.062 --> 31:34.206
You did a good job.

31:34.250 --> 31:37.370
We did a good job. It's not over yet.

31:42.593 --> 31:44.813
- Chaplain's waiting for me.
- No, no, no, no.

31:44.856 --> 31:46.722
Don't go yet. Not yet.

31:48.425 --> 31:49.905
I got to go.

32:31.308 --> 32:32.861
Jeremy.

32:33.546 --> 32:34.979
Haven't seen you in years,

32:35.023 --> 32:36.448
but I knew, when Carlos lost

32:36.492 --> 32:38.591
his last appeal, that you would crack.

32:38.598 --> 32:40.153
Now, I don't know
what you think you heard,

32:40.178 --> 32:41.393
but I didn't sell you out, man.

32:41.437 --> 32:42.968
I got you on tape, dumb-ass,

32:43.011 --> 32:45.982
literally selling evidence against me.

32:46.025 --> 32:48.533
- I never gave them your name.
- But they got it.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.848
Which means you and me got a problem.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.864
All right, you want the cash? It's yours.

32:53.908 --> 32:55.188
Just take it.

32:55.231 --> 32:56.848
I'll leave, I'll never come back.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.763
They want a witness, it won't be me.

32:58.807 --> 33:00.112
Yeah?

33:08.995 --> 33:11.955
What are you reaching for, huh?

33:43.286 --> 33:44.766
Jeremy's not picking up?

33:44.809 --> 33:46.746
- Better be on his way.
- Yeah, let's hope so

33:46.771 --> 33:49.803
because we need him on record.
It's Carlos's last shot.

33:54.826 --> 33:56.306
Zara.

33:56.331 --> 33:58.072
We found Jeremy.

34:00.738 --> 34:01.826
He's been shot, Eric.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.567
Jeremy's dead.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.443
Okay.

34:42.806 --> 34:44.632
We got one last shot at this.

34:44.676 --> 34:46.853
We got to change the D.A.'s mind,

34:46.878 --> 34:49.446
- get her to call the governor.
- With no evidence?

34:49.507 --> 34:51.596
How you gonna do that, Eric?
She's a top prosecutor.

34:51.639 --> 34:54.034
- She's brilliant.
- I'm gonna use that against her.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.931
Thank you for doing this, sir.

35:01.868 --> 35:03.783
You can't go through with this.

35:03.827 --> 35:06.838
Our witness was murdered
to cover up the truth.

35:07.787 --> 35:10.573
Please, call the governor's office.

35:11.468 --> 35:13.576
You're executing the wrong man.

35:15.038 --> 35:17.075
Mr. Schroeder is willing
to testify that his son

35:17.100 --> 35:19.059
was involved in a criminal
conspiracy the night

35:19.084 --> 35:20.651
- of his death.
- All I've ever wanted is

35:20.676 --> 35:22.330
justice for my son, Ms. Ambrose.

35:22.355 --> 35:24.009
This conspiracy led

35:24.034 --> 35:27.733
to Lowell's murder at the hands
of an accomplice, Dale McIntosh.

35:27.758 --> 35:29.964
Do you have any hard evidence
of what you're claiming?

35:29.989 --> 35:31.570
A sworn affidavit, a-a recording?

35:31.595 --> 35:32.901
Unfortunately not, no, the witness...

35:32.926 --> 35:34.362
I know this is painful to face,

35:34.387 --> 35:36.607
but everything you're
suggesting is circumstantial.

35:36.632 --> 35:40.114
You've been prosecuting Carlos,
uh, since he was a juvenile.

35:40.435 --> 35:42.045
When this charge came across your desk,

35:42.070 --> 35:44.115
it was gonna be nothing but
the harshest sentence possible.

35:44.140 --> 35:46.881
My personal feelings have
nothing to do with it.

35:46.906 --> 35:49.343
We have three-strikes laws for a reason.

35:49.368 --> 35:53.589
After his third conviction,
Carlos's chances ran out.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.720
The law has done its job.

35:56.326 --> 35:59.242
You may not like it, but it's
my job to see it through.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.898
Mr. Perez,

36:14.923 --> 36:19.102
do you wish to make any
statements or last words?

36:19.163 --> 36:21.122
Please...

36:22.152 --> 36:23.456
...tell Donna...

36:24.016 --> 36:25.875
I love her.

36:27.258 --> 36:29.608
Tell Luke...

36:29.633 --> 36:31.678
I-I love him.

36:32.959 --> 36:34.961
Tell them...

36:36.354 --> 36:38.922
Please tell everyone...

36:40.053 --> 36:42.055
I'm sorry.

36:49.324 --> 36:51.784
For the crime of murder
in the first degree,

36:52.318 --> 36:54.428
Carlos William Perez

36:54.471 --> 36:55.982
is condemned to death.

36:56.026 --> 36:59.421
All right, listen to me, ten years ago,

36:59.446 --> 37:02.319
the cops didn't realize that the
security tape had been swapped,

37:03.204 --> 37:05.427
but you knew it was the wrong footage

37:05.452 --> 37:07.500
and you looked the other way.

37:08.512 --> 37:10.558
When I told you about the
tampered evidence yesterday,

37:10.583 --> 37:13.064
you barely flinched, and I wondered why.

37:13.089 --> 37:16.179
You are highly meticulous,
your reputation's perfect.

37:16.204 --> 37:18.032
But it took my team all of an hour

37:18.057 --> 37:19.928
to figure out that it was the wrong tape,

37:19.953 --> 37:21.780
and you missed it completely?
I don't think so.

37:22.052 --> 37:23.349
Injecting sedative.

37:23.374 --> 37:26.539
Carlos's conviction in
2009 helped propel you to D.A.

37:26.564 --> 37:28.349
You needed him to be guilty then,

37:28.374 --> 37:30.898
and with an upcoming election
you need him guilty now.

37:30.923 --> 37:32.664
If you're suggesting
that I sent a man to prison

37:32.689 --> 37:33.995
for a crime I knew he didn't commit...

37:34.020 --> 37:35.326
No, I'm not, I'm not.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.547
I don't doubt your sincerity

37:38.590 --> 37:40.226
- or your sense of duty.
- That's right.

37:40.269 --> 37:42.077
My only duty has been to the truth.

37:42.121 --> 37:43.632
All right, then you look me in the eye

37:43.676 --> 37:46.250
and you tell me it's
the truth you didn't know

37:46.294 --> 37:47.730
that the footage had been tampered with.

37:47.773 --> 37:49.122
I... did what I had to do.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.877
Just the truth.

37:51.473 --> 37:53.257
Did you know about the tampered footage?

37:55.561 --> 37:57.476
Everything else lined up...

37:57.501 --> 37:58.885
But you knew.

38:00.917 --> 38:03.098
You are too good of a prosecutor

38:03.123 --> 38:04.820
to let this one error of judgment

38:04.845 --> 38:06.890
tarnish everything that you stand for.

38:06.915 --> 38:09.221
Please, for the love of God,

38:09.544 --> 38:11.285
do the right thing.

38:30.512 --> 38:32.514
Get me the governor's office.

38:32.557 --> 38:34.255
Tell him it's Heidi Ambrose.

38:48.975 --> 38:51.326
Thank you so much for everything.

38:51.351 --> 38:53.179
Did they tell you what happens next?

38:53.448 --> 38:56.538
If the governor is commuting,
how long will you be in here?

38:56.581 --> 38:58.278
Actually, that's complicated.

38:58.303 --> 39:00.071
They're not letting you out.

39:01.369 --> 39:02.761
They're commuting the death sentence

39:02.786 --> 39:03.961
and leaving you in here.

39:07.897 --> 39:09.464
Yes, but we're hopeful.

39:09.489 --> 39:11.274
They're keeping you in here
for a crime you didn't commit.

39:11.335 --> 39:13.598
- It's okay.
- That's not okay.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.165
It's a miscarriage of justice.

39:15.208 --> 39:18.473
I'm filing a motion to
vacate the conviction.

39:18.882 --> 39:21.171
When they hear my case, they're
not gonna be able to deny it.

39:21.214 --> 39:23.391
They should be letting you out
and compensating you

39:23.416 --> 39:26.848
for the years of your life
you wasted because of them.

39:26.873 --> 39:28.016
Ms. Walker,

39:28.097 --> 39:29.527
I'm alive.

39:30.018 --> 39:32.138
I owe you my life.

39:32.854 --> 39:35.940
I'm gonna see my kid grow up
because of you.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.085
The police picked up Dale
McIntosh on Jeremy's murder.

39:54.129 --> 39:55.639
And with Eddie's cooperation,

39:55.682 --> 39:58.046
they should have enough
to tie him to Lowell's, too.

40:01.716 --> 40:03.468
Is everything all right with you?

40:04.427 --> 40:05.824
Uh...

40:07.696 --> 40:09.872
I told you I was an only child.

40:09.915 --> 40:11.007
That wasn't the truth.

40:12.178 --> 40:13.811
I have a brother.

40:14.442 --> 40:16.400
He, uh, he was in prison

40:16.444 --> 40:18.733
for killing our foster father.

40:19.621 --> 40:21.840
He's out now, and he's living with me.

40:26.105 --> 40:27.846
I'm always here if you want to talk.

40:29.631 --> 40:30.806
Thank you.

40:33.199 --> 40:35.898
All right, coming through. Open the gate.

40:45.222 --> 40:46.397
Welcome back.

40:49.694 --> 40:51.348
Spaghetti and meatballs
still your favorite?

40:51.392 --> 40:52.654
Is it out of a can,

40:52.697 --> 40:55.352
and will you heat it up
for me like you used to?

40:57.049 --> 41:00.009
Well, I-it's $75 worth of pasta

41:00.052 --> 41:03.099
and-and a nice bottle of Pinot,

41:03.142 --> 41:04.405
but other than that,

41:04.448 --> 41:05.971
it will be just like old times.

41:08.278 --> 41:10.454
- What do you say?
- All right.

41:10.479 --> 41:13.221
All right, let's do it.
Grab the plates. Oh.
