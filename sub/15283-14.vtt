00:21.770 --> 00:24.180
<i>Deceased</i>

00:27.800 --> 00:30.330
Detective fulwood.

00:32.780 --> 00:34.550
You got a visitor.

00:34.570 --> 00:35.970
I'm not here.

00:35.990 --> 00:38.490
It's sandra lombardini.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.770
The body we found the
woods-- it wasn't brooke.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.270
Do you know who?

00:55.310 --> 00:57.770
It was lynette hagen.

00:57.780 --> 01:01.010
Her parents just identified the remains.

01:03.110 --> 01:07.930
We have people searching the area,
but the rain's making it tough.

01:09.550 --> 01:12.290
You should try to get
some sleep, sandra.

01:12.650 --> 01:15.200
I can't.

01:15.710 --> 01:18.070
Not without knowing.

01:20.750 --> 01:23.980
Ron, I need something from you.

01:24.670 --> 01:25.770
Anything.

01:25.810 --> 01:31.300
The necklace--brooke's-- the one
you found on the ground by the car.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.900
That's in evidence.

01:32.930 --> 01:35.130
Something like that may take some time.

01:35.170 --> 01:38.380
Please. I need it.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.620
May I ask you why?

01:42.650 --> 01:45.530
He says it could tell him things.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.850
What is it?

02:45.570 --> 02:48.080
What did you see?

02:52.790 --> 02:56.710
"current influences should turn this
day into one with plenty of potential,"

02:56.720 --> 02:58.860
"but aidhe trap of trying too hard.

02:58.890 --> 03:00.620
Know your strengths. Rely on them.

03:00.630 --> 03:04.260
"confidence, real or pretend,
is your magic ingredient."

03:04.290 --> 03:06.020
Confidence. Yes, I like that.

03:06.030 --> 03:08.620
Come on, guys, you don't think there's
actually anything to that stuff, do you?

03:08.630 --> 03:09.910
You'd be surprised.

03:09.930 --> 03:11.760
- It's gibberish.
- Thank you.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.420
Oh, you are just jealous because
you don't have the magic ingredient.

03:14.450 --> 03:17.080
I have the magic ingredient.
It's called splenda.

03:17.090 --> 03:18.940
All right, skeptic, what's your sign?

03:18.950 --> 03:19.880
No.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.730
No--is that
in april?

03:21.740 --> 03:23.270
Reid, we need a d.o.b.on prentiss.

03:23.310 --> 03:26.400
Ah, 7:12 a.m.,
october 12, 19--

03:26.410 --> 03:27.730
libra--i should
have known.

03:27.760 --> 03:32.880
"a romantic opportunity may experience a slight
hitch thanks to the pesky lunar influence"

03:32.920 --> 03:36.340
"which could have you dipping
into a rather chilly mood.

03:36.370 --> 03:39.390
If being demonstrative
and warm is difficult,"

03:39.430 --> 03:43.130
"then neutralize this temporary cold front
with a simple but affectionate gesture."

03:43.170 --> 03:44.960
I have a simple gesture.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.070
You guys ready to gather?

03:47.100 --> 03:49.520
Well, look at you, miss thing. First
day back and you're all business.

03:49.530 --> 03:53.360
Well, it's either dive right in
or confront my separation anxiety.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.850
- It's tough being away from him, huh?
- Yeah.

03:56.450 --> 03:58.160
Oh, hey, that's new, isn't it?

03:58.190 --> 04:00.820
Yeah, citrine. It's henry's birthstone.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.320
Will and I both got one.

04:02.350 --> 04:04.160
Oh, that's sweet.

04:04.190 --> 04:04.850
You done with this?

04:04.860 --> 04:06.810
- All yours.
- Thank you.

04:09.310 --> 04:13.030
There's been a string of abductions in
olympia, washington, going back 9 months.

04:13.050 --> 04:17.260
4 women in all, blond,
blue-eyed, early 20s.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.019
This morning they found one.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.250
- When were they taken?
- 9 months ago.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.300
- So she was the first?
- Yeah.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.420
Looks almost mummified.

04:25.430 --> 04:27.030
Uh, not exactly.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.220
- Frozen?
- Embalmed.

04:29.230 --> 04:30.130
That's different.

04:30.150 --> 04:33.550
Yeah. So the time of death is a
bit of a question mark right now.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.670
Where did they find her?

04:34.710 --> 04:36.700
In a state park just east of olympia.

04:36.730 --> 04:37.940
Seasonal hiking area.

04:37.970 --> 04:40.260
The body was jarred
loose during a mudslide.

04:40.300 --> 04:45.130
That, plus the abnormal decomp makes it
difficult to know how long she was there.

04:45.140 --> 04:47.910
It says the victims were
abducted about 3 months apart.

04:47.940 --> 04:49.730
He's rotating his victims out.

04:49.740 --> 04:52.080
There are gonna be
more bodies out there.

"and so, all the night tide

05:37.130 --> 05:41.150
"i lay down by the side
of my darling, my darling,"

05:41.180 --> 05:45.420
"my life and my bride,in the
sepulcher there by the sea,"

05:45.450 --> 05:48.900
In her tomb by the sounding sea."

05:48.910 --> 05:51.400
Edgar allan poe.

05:51.410 --> 05:55.480
So if I wanted to embalm a
body, well, what's the process?

05:55.490 --> 05:57.160
Start with some nose plugs.

05:57.170 --> 05:58.910
The blood is drained
through the jugular vein

05:58.920 --> 06:01.390
And replaced with embalming fluid
through one of the two major arteries.

06:01.430 --> 06:02.940
It usually takes a few hours.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.300
Then you'd need special
equipment, training.

06:05.310 --> 06:08.150
Knowledge of the human vascular
system would also be a plus.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.060
A doctor, maybe.

06:09.070 --> 06:11.950
A nurse, technician, somebody with
a background in mortuary sciences.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.740
Now, there's a major they
didn't offer at my school.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.840
Personally, the whole thing
just seems weird to me.

06:15.850 --> 06:17.260
Embalming, I mean.

06:17.290 --> 06:19.000
Some people like to look
good for their funeral.

06:19.020 --> 06:22.720
But it's not them. It's just
a shell, polished and painted.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.000
I just want to be cremated.

06:24.030 --> 06:27.100
The question is why somebody would embalm
the body of someone they just murdered.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.430
He wants to hold on to them.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.150
It's a possession issue.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.310
This way they can never leave.

06:32.340 --> 06:34.330
Maybe fear of abandonment
speaks to his history.

06:34.360 --> 06:38.770
But eventually even an embalmed body will decay
and he finds himself in need of new victiMs.

06:38.790 --> 06:41.910
That explains the abduction
cycle-- a new victim every 3 months.

06:41.940 --> 06:45.990
Which means at least 2 of the
remaining women are already dead.

06:46.020 --> 06:48.110
- And the third?
- Brooke lombardini.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.590
It's been 4 days since she, uh, disappeared
following her shift at a local restaurant.

06:53.950 --> 06:55.230
We know the odds.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.690
90% of all abduction victims are
killed within the first 36 hours.

07:13.910 --> 07:17.400
Hiker found a foot protruding
from the soil right up here.

07:17.410 --> 07:19.920
Whole side of the hill
slid down from up there.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.300
So you're focusing the
search in this area here.

07:22.330 --> 07:26.560
Yeah, but if he dumped other bodies here,
he's got over 800 acres to work with.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.270
Keep your men near the
fire road, detective.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.970
One man dragging a body
through the woods...

07:30.000 --> 07:32.790
110 pounds of dead weight, he's
not gonna get far from the path.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.630
That's why a lot of killers
dismember their victiMs.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.520
They're easier to dispose of that way.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.220
You think it says something about
the profile, he didn't chop her up?

07:39.240 --> 07:41.690
Possibly, yeah.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.400
What is it?

07:52.260 --> 07:53.790
Uh, detective.

07:53.810 --> 07:56.410
We got--we got
something up here.

08:09.280 --> 08:15.140
The answer to your question, detective, is
yes, this killer can't dismember these women.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.770
He cares for them.

08:18.270 --> 08:21.710
Brooke worked the closing
shift the night she disappeared.

08:21.730 --> 08:24.850
She would have walked
this way to her car.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.440
Upscale restaurant?

08:26.470 --> 08:31.170
Well, let's just say that I don't go
unless it's on someone else's dime.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.710
What are you thinking?

08:32.750 --> 08:35.630
These women were taken
as they left work.

08:35.650 --> 08:38.070
High-end spa, nice
restaurant, jewelry store.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.860
If he patronizes these
businesses, then he's got money.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.600
It narrows the profile a little.

08:42.630 --> 08:45.840
The cook said that he left
just a few minutes after brooke.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.240
Saw her car there,
driver's side door open.

08:48.270 --> 08:49.940
He was quick. Surprised her.

08:49.950 --> 08:51.700
11 p.m., it was dark, he had cover.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.170
She probably never saw him coming.

08:53.210 --> 08:57.080
It says in here they recovered her
necklace, amethyst, broken chain?

08:57.350 --> 08:59.980
Right here, right next to the car.

09:01.270 --> 09:02.870
Did you process the necklace?

09:02.890 --> 09:04.480
We couldn't get anything off of it.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.480
Just some hair in the clasp. Hers.

09:07.490 --> 09:09.730
I'd like to take a look at it.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.410
Yeah, well, I gave
it back to her mother.

09:13.110 --> 09:15.980
Isn't it a little premature to be
returning evidence to the family?

09:16.010 --> 09:18.440
There were special circumstances.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.940
She hired someone.

09:19.980 --> 09:22.590
Guy by the name of, uh, stanley usher.

09:22.610 --> 09:24.820
He helped find a kid in
portland a couple years ago.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.770
Private investigator?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.650
A psychic.

09:29.580 --> 09:31.690
What does that have to
do with the necklace?

09:31.720 --> 09:35.330
Apparently he can
read personal things...

09:35.340 --> 09:38.110
Their aura. I don't know.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.790
So what did he tell her?

09:43.300 --> 09:46.460
I know brooke is still alive.

09:46.730 --> 09:49.910
It's not too late for
you to do the right thing.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.560
Let her come home to me.

09:51.570 --> 09:54.710
She turns 27 on wednesday.

09:54.740 --> 09:57.710
Wish she would have waited until
we had a chance to coach her.

09:57.740 --> 10:00.090
I don't know, she seems to
be doing a pretty good job.

10:00.110 --> 10:02.930
Good enough to make the unsub
think twice about killing brooke.

10:03.230 --> 10:05.170
If he hasn't already.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.320
Chances are this is all too late.

10:07.350 --> 10:09.970
It's her daughter. She
has to have hope, right?

10:09.980 --> 10:12.760
Hope's one thing. False
hope is something else.

10:12.770 --> 10:15.270
I guess you've worked
with psychics before?

10:15.300 --> 10:17.900
Yeah. Not by choice.

10:17.910 --> 10:21.050
You know, there are cases where
people believe they've helped.

10:21.070 --> 10:25.600
When people are vulnerable,
they'll believe a lot of things.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.890
We think the man who took her,
uh, may have come by her work.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.700
A customer, someone she
may have talked about.

10:35.730 --> 10:37.100
We think this man is a loner.

10:37.140 --> 10:40.620
He would dine by himself,
make frequent visits.

10:40.650 --> 10:43.660
But he's shy, avoids eye contact.

10:43.690 --> 10:45.510
She got asked out sometimes.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.270
No, this man wouldn't
have asked her out.

10:47.310 --> 10:48.720
He wouldn't have had the courage.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.240
He would have stared at
her, made her uncomfortable.

10:54.290 --> 10:57.000
I've told the police everything I know.

10:57.020 --> 11:00.730
You shouldn't be here. You
should be looking into the clues.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.940
Right. Clues from brooke's necklace.

11:03.950 --> 11:06.870
Yes, sir. It's called
token object reading, or--

11:06.880 --> 11:08.990
psychometry.

11:09.020 --> 11:11.670
Yeah. You're not my first.

11:12.360 --> 11:18.310
A fenced-in area, the color
orange, and the numbers 8, 6, 7.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.180
Does that help you?

11:23.190 --> 11:26.850
So, Mr. Usher, by
touching a personal item,

11:26.860 --> 11:30.380
you think that you can tell
if someone's alive or dead.

11:30.410 --> 11:32.400
Sometimes.

11:32.430 --> 11:36.190
See, a person's energy makes an
impression on everything they touch.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.630
It allows me to connect with them.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.920
The hard part is
interpreting what I'm given.

11:41.960 --> 11:46.390
Did you get anything else,
uh, about her condition?

11:46.400 --> 11:48.570
Only that she...

11:48.600 --> 11:54.230
Felt weakened, tired. I
don't know, uh... Heavy.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.240
Heavy. Can I talk to you for a second?

12:00.790 --> 12:02.750
Excuse me.

12:02.760 --> 12:08.850
I've been around a little, and I've seen guys
le you come into the lives of grieving families.

12:08.890 --> 12:11.550
- Sir, I assure you, that's
not what-- - listen to me.

12:11.560 --> 12:16.600
The last thing this woman needs is some
con man giving her unrealistic ideas.

12:16.650 --> 12:20.130
With all due respect, sir, you
may not know what she needs.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.910
Your job is to know the perpetrators.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.760
We're not talking about my job.

12:23.790 --> 12:25.350
Well, maybe we should be.

12:25.390 --> 12:29.060
Because there are a lot of people out there
who don't believe in what you do, either.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.810
I just got a call.
They found a third body.

12:39.170 --> 12:43.880
Annette hagen, erin bonham, and
melissa st. Claire, all embalmed.

12:43.890 --> 12:47.040
That's the first 3. That leaves
the lombardini girl still out there.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.340
Did you figure out cause of death?

12:49.370 --> 12:50.470
Blood loss.

12:50.490 --> 12:51.910
Blood loss?

12:51.930 --> 12:53.440
They were alive when they were embalmed?

12:53.470 --> 12:57.440
Looks that way. Tox screens show
significant levels of barbiturate.

12:57.450 --> 13:00.770
They were sedated, maybe unconscious.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.670
Reid, look at this. They
all have the same haircut.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.500
These are recent photos. These two had much
longer hair at the time of their auction.

13:06.510 --> 13:07.880
So the unsub cut it.

13:07.910 --> 13:09.960
Something else he may have done.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.600
Their ears have all
been double-pierced.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.140
Were they sexually assaulted?

13:17.160 --> 13:18.480
Not exactly.

13:18.500 --> 13:22.300
There was no tearing or bruising
that would normally suggest it.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.810
But I did find trace amounts of semen.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.910
You're saying it may
have been consensual?

13:26.950 --> 13:28.280
No.

13:28.310 --> 13:30.510
She's saying they were dead.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.990
I spoke to the families.

13:36.030 --> 13:39.540
None of the victims had double-pierced
ears at the time of their abduction.

13:39.550 --> 13:42.230
Cutting hair and piercing ears.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.570
He's changing them.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.710
- Into what, though?
- Into who.

13:47.470 --> 13:49.780
The burial suggests an
affection for his victiMs.

13:49.820 --> 13:52.460
Which says he might be remaking
them into the image of a loved one.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.110
The m.e.found high
levels of barbiturate?

13:55.120 --> 13:56.070
Yeah. Why?

13:56.080 --> 14:01.150
Just, uh, something the psychic
said-- that brooke felt tired, heavy.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.710
Why are we talking about the psychic?

14:02.740 --> 14:06.020
It's a scam. These guys talk without
saying anythg and you fall for it.

14:06.030 --> 14:08.840
Well, he said that brooke's alive,
so I guess I just want to believe him.

14:08.870 --> 14:10.230
Jj, you know the profile.

14:10.270 --> 14:13.550
A necrophiliac has no
use for a live victim.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.800
You ready to talk to them?

14:22.090 --> 14:25.110
Garcia, I need you to run a
full background check for me.

14:25.150 --> 14:29.140
Name's usher, stanley usher.

14:29.150 --> 14:32.280
By now we know the dna found on the
victims did not match anyone in the system,

14:32.310 --> 14:36.060
So we're gonna have to look beyond
physical evidence to identify the killer.

14:36.090 --> 14:40.470
Our unsub is a white male in his mid
- to late 20s, and he has money.

14:40.510 --> 14:42.810
He lives alone, in a large residence.

14:42.850 --> 14:46.670
There's enough space and ventilation
to accommodate an embalming suite.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.630
He's awkward with
people, especially women.

14:48.690 --> 14:51.860
An inability to relate socially
is common in homicidal necrophiles.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.270
Because of the
alterations to the bodies,

14:53.280 --> 14:57.110
we believe the unsub is attempting
to recreate a woman he once loved.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.140
Like a girlfriend?

14:58.170 --> 15:01.720
Or a wife, a mother. Someone
who left or died suddenly.

15:01.730 --> 15:05.080
This projection of the loved one coupled
with his need to preserve the victims

15:05.090 --> 15:09.690
through embalming is similar to the
psychopathology of serial murderer ed gein.

15:09.720 --> 15:13.000
Gein had an oedipal complex which developed
in the years he nursed his paralyzed mother

15:13.040 --> 15:14.350
back from a stroke.

15:14.370 --> 15:19.760
After she died, his obsession compelled him to
dig up corpses of women who resembled his mother.

15:19.790 --> 15:22.570
So persistent was his desire to
resurrect his dead mother that

15:22.600 --> 15:28.040
He actually dressed in female
suits fashioned from human skin.

15:28.060 --> 15:31.010
Eventually, gein grew unhappy
with the flesh of dead bodies,

15:31.040 --> 15:32.980
Which had a tendency to dry and crack,

15:33.020 --> 15:36.850
So he shifted his focus to live victims
whose bodies he could better preserve.

15:36.900 --> 15:41.520
The evolution from dead to live victims will
also be mirrored in our unsub's maturation.

15:41.560 --> 15:45.380
We've put together a list of
incident reports prior to 2006.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.230
You're gon want to follow up on these.

15:47.270 --> 15:52.260
Now, they are inappropriate postmortem conduct,
cadaver theft, and graveyard disturbances.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.600
60% of necrophiles work
in the death business,

15:54.630 --> 15:57.630
So be sure to canvass local
cemeteries, mortuaries, and morgues.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.960
And since we have the killer's dna, we're gonna be
sending you out with kits to swab potential suspects.

16:01.970 --> 16:04.560
The odds of finding brooke
lombardini alive are slim,

16:04.590 --> 16:07.410
But the quicker we identify the
killer, the better her chances are.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.550
For her sake, let's work fast.

16:11.060 --> 16:13.270
That lawsuit is a joke.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.970
It's my job to prep the deceased.
I s simply adjusting her clothing.

16:16.980 --> 16:18.990
By adjusting you mean undressing?

16:20.250 --> 16:22.540
Look, man, I'm not here to judge you.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.550
I'm looking for a killer.

16:24.580 --> 16:27.540
So if you want to prove your innocence,
all you gotta do is say "ahh."

16:27.950 --> 16:32.870
We're looking for instances where graves have
been disturbed-- desecrations, exhumations.

16:32.900 --> 16:36.060
Female bodies. Attractive ones.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.440
Nobody's attractive once
they've been in the ground.

16:38.470 --> 16:40.630
They would have been recent burials.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.710
No, haven't had anything like that.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.330
An older grave got
ransacked a couple years ago.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.810
Was the body taken?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.040
No. The body was just a pile of bones.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.640
They stripped it clean, though.

16:51.670 --> 16:54.700
Made off with the jewelry, dress.

16:56.610 --> 17:00.570
I won't lie. It--it
happens in the industry.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.800
And we put a stop to it when it does.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.950
You don't report it to the police?

17:04.990 --> 17:09.270
Well, we... Like to keep
that kind of thing quiet.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.310
A killer is dressing up his
dead victims and violating them.

17:12.349 --> 17:15.079
Maybe quiet isn't the best way to go.

17:15.109 --> 17:17.160
He dresses them up?

17:17.190 --> 17:19.550
That mean something to you?

17:19.950 --> 17:22.349
We hired an apprentice a while back.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.900
Odd guy. Even for this business.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.690
I didn't like the attention
he paid the female cadavers.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.550
I come to find out he
liked to do their makeup.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.830
Put a wig on them and such.

17:32.870 --> 17:35.100
Can you describe the wig for me?

17:35.130 --> 17:38.040
We cleaned out his locker
after his termination.

17:38.050 --> 17:40.410
There she is.

17:41.470 --> 17:44.590
He never came back for it. Imagine that.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.190
I need this man's name.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.380
Ivan bakunas?

18:00.790 --> 18:02.360
Yeah. Can i--
can I help you?

18:02.370 --> 18:05.640
You could invite us inside.
It's a little wet out here.

18:05.650 --> 18:07.830
Oh, i--i can't.
Mother's sleeping.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.010
We're investigating a series
of murders in the area.

18:10.030 --> 18:12.900
We believe the killer
works in your field.

18:12.910 --> 18:15.070
Jeez. You're kidding. Do I know him?

18:15.080 --> 18:19.860
You might. His victims are just
your type. Blond hair, blue skin.

18:21.490 --> 18:23.410
You're suggesting I'm
some kind of murderer?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.650
Then you are way out of line.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.360
So you wouldn't object to
giving us a sample of your dna.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.260
I don't know. No.

18:31.270 --> 18:33.680
We can get a warrant.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.200
I think I've said all I'm gonna say.

18:37.220 --> 18:39.650
Did you find anything on ivan bakunas?

18:39.670 --> 18:41.270
Nothing in juvey.

18:41.310 --> 18:44.110
But he was expelled from evergreen
state For assaulting his girlfriend.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.030
sexual?

18:45.060 --> 18:48.150
He was slipping her tranquilizers
and having sex with r while she slept.

18:48.180 --> 18:49.610
That qualifies.

18:49.620 --> 18:53.610
Oh, wait! Emily, maybe this is that
romantic encounter your horoscope foretold.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.390
Bye, garcia.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.640
Between that and the wig, we
should be able to persuade a judge.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.640
Detective, I'm not gonna stand in your way
if you want to serve a warrant on bakunas,

19:01.680 --> 19:02.940
But I think you're wasting your time.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.050
You're kidding, right?

19:04.090 --> 19:05.570
We profiled a man of means.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.110
According to his tax records, bakunas hasn't
held down a job since he graduated college.

19:09.140 --> 19:11.250
He lives with his mother.
Doesn't have a car.

19:11.260 --> 19:14.170
The embalming equipment, the
drugs-- that stuff's not cheap.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.540
Look, this guys like to
get it on with dead people.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.730
If that's not probable
cause, I don't know what is.

19:19.760 --> 19:25.010
Hotch, a 911 operator just got a distress call
from someone claiming to be brooke lombardini.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.540
Hello?

19:28.550 --> 19:30.370
Can you speak up, ma'am?

19:30.380 --> 19:33.550
No. He'll hear me.

19:33.560 --> 19:39.300
This is brooke lombardini.
Please, I need help.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.120
Where are you calling from, ma'am?

19:41.150 --> 19:43.990
I'm being held prisoner.

19:44.020 --> 19:45.830
Ok, ma'am. Can you look outside?

19:45.840 --> 19:48.090
Can you see a street name or an address?

19:48.130 --> 19:50.760
Please... I think he's...

19:50.770 --> 19:52.460
- Ma'am?
- Gonna kill me.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.980
Please help me.

20:07.040 --> 20:12.760
Y surveillance expert will tell you it's almost
impossible to positively identify a whisper.

20:12.770 --> 20:15.800
You think I don't know
my own daughter's voice?

20:15.840 --> 20:19.360
Why would someone who was not
brooke call 911 and say they were?

20:19.390 --> 20:22.340
Sometimes people get off injecting
themselves into the story.

20:22.380 --> 20:27.600
You've been on tv now and that could
bring out a lot of sick individuals.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.920
Stanley said she was
alive. This proves it.

20:30.930 --> 20:35.050
Stanley usher has a vested interest in
telling you that your daughter is alive.

20:35.090 --> 20:38.810
And do you have a vested interest
in telling me that she's not?

20:38.840 --> 20:41.240
He has a record, ma'am.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.930
I had a colleague look into it.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.770
Usher was charged
with fraud in oregon...

20:49.070 --> 20:52.240
Before he pulled up
stakes and moved here.

21:07.180 --> 21:10.520
I need my baby to be alive.

21:15.050 --> 21:17.850
All she has right now is hope.

21:18.390 --> 21:21.420
Why would you take that from her?

21:35.460 --> 21:41.010
You know, most people think that a person's hair
and nails continue to grow after they're dead.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.340
That's a myth.

21:45.200 --> 21:50.170
Abby... Abby... Abby, hold still.

21:52.350 --> 21:55.270
I know how much you
like a straight line.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.130
Who's abby?

21:57.140 --> 21:59.290
You are, silly.

22:03.540 --> 22:05.620
911 call came from a disposable cell.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.690
No i.d., but they traced
it to the nearest tower

22:07.710 --> 22:11.280
And that narrows it down to a 20-mile
radius here just southeast of seattle.

22:11.310 --> 22:13.690
That's a densely populated area.
Were they able to triangulate?

22:13.700 --> 22:16.280
Garcia tried to ping the
phone, but it was already dead.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.450
The unsub probably turned it
off when he found her with it.

22:18.490 --> 22:20.100
You mean if he found her.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.840
Dave, I agree with you about psychics,

22:21.880 --> 22:25.120
But the fact is sandra lombardini
positively identified her daughter's voice.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.830
We have to assume that
that call was genuine.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.050
So what do we think?

22:30.090 --> 22:32.210
Why is the unsub keeping brooke alive?

22:32.240 --> 22:34.140
And how long do we think
she has until he kills her?

22:34.170 --> 22:36.550
Maybe he needs them alive to
effect their transformation.

22:36.580 --> 22:39.920
The change in the hair, the makeup, piercing
the ears-- that would only take a few hours.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.420
He's had her for almost 5 days.

22:41.470 --> 22:43.820
Ok, so maybe it's about something
more than just appearance.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.080
Maybe it's something deeper.

22:45.110 --> 22:49.040
On the phone she made it sound li she was
being locked up, and she sounded drugged.

22:49.060 --> 22:52.380
These are control mechanisms used in
cases of sexual slavery, mind control--

22:52.390 --> 22:53.370
it's brainwashing.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.820
So he's trying to break her down,
make her surrender her identity.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.280
That's what he's waiting for.

22:58.310 --> 23:00.580
That's the version of
them he wants to hold onto.

23:00.590 --> 23:02.830
The longer she holds out,
the longer she stays alive.

23:02.870 --> 23:06.400
And as soon as she accepts her
new role, her fate is sealed.

23:09.090 --> 23:11.650
Abby?

23:13.800 --> 23:16.270
Abby.

23:22.230 --> 23:24.530
Tell me a story, abby.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.090
You know I can't sleep without a story.

23:34.970 --> 23:37.320
Please...

23:37.980 --> 23:39.810
Let me out.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.500
Story first, abby.

23:41.520 --> 23:45.740
I told you, I'm not abby.

24:10.860 --> 24:13.270
What did you do to me?

24:14.010 --> 24:16.620
Tell me a story, abby.

24:18.030 --> 24:21.320
I told you, I'm not abby!

24:26.160 --> 24:28.110
Ok. Thank you.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.010
That was the lab with the
dna results on those swabs.

24:31.030 --> 24:34.040
- No matches?
- No. Our guy's still out there.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.000
What's he doing here?

24:37.420 --> 24:39.510
Detective, a word.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.020
Do you know what you're doing?

24:46.110 --> 24:49.370
Can't afford to let my ego
get in the way on this one.

24:49.380 --> 24:51.460
Take all the help I can get.

24:51.470 --> 24:53.430
Look, I'm happy to
be wrong about brooke.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.910
Hell, I'm praying I am.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.680
But I'm not wrong about this guy.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.190
Mr. Usher, good to see you again.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.240
And you.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.940
Can I help you with something?

25:06.460 --> 25:08.680
I'm spoken for.

25:11.690 --> 25:14.160
- This way.
- Ma'am.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.490
Congratulations.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.450
Tell me a story, abby.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.670
Tell me a story so I can sleep.

26:00.740 --> 26:03.420
"once upon a time there was once...

26:03.430 --> 26:06.600
A lad who went to look for a place..."

26:06.610 --> 26:11.430
"and he went along, he met a man
who asked him where he was going."

26:12.590 --> 26:15.300
He told him his errand and
the stranger said that he--"

26:15.320 --> 26:18.080
you're not doing it right!

26:18.540 --> 26:20.110
You're supposed to do the voices.

26:20.130 --> 26:23.190
Ok, just tell me what
you want and i'll do it!

26:23.220 --> 26:24.310
I want abby!

26:24.330 --> 26:28.740
I'll be abby! I'll be whoever you want!

26:29.740 --> 26:34.470
No! No! No!

26:37.530 --> 26:39.860
Abby?

26:43.040 --> 26:45.730
Abby.

26:55.710 --> 26:57.740
So you went ahead and arrested him.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.880
He was trying to cross
the border into vancouver.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.020
Are you gonna charge him?

27:01.040 --> 27:03.070
Will if he confesses.

27:03.100 --> 27:07.500
Failing that, we'll hold him so he can't skip
town while we're waiting for his dna results.

27:07.550 --> 27:09.840
I'll let the lab know a
priority sample's coming.

27:09.850 --> 27:11.460
Thanks.

27:12.110 --> 27:14.760
Well, what did he get
off of the wig, detective?

27:14.790 --> 27:18.030
Enough to know that that's
one sick puppy in there.

27:18.490 --> 27:21.920
Why don't you tell me about that.

27:22.710 --> 27:25.660
- Looks like a wig.
- That is a magic wig.

27:25.670 --> 27:28.010
It chaes the identity of the dead.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.530
What?

27:29.550 --> 27:34.310
Well, I thought that's why you were
putting it on the bodies at the morgue.

27:34.710 --> 27:37.490
It makes the fantasy more real.

27:40.510 --> 27:42.740
Ivan...

27:42.750 --> 27:45.390
Who were you trying to turn them into?

27:46.780 --> 27:52.680
I have worked some sick
cases-- rapists, pederasts--

27:52.700 --> 27:55.640
I hope you're not grouping
me with those people.

27:55.650 --> 27:58.290
You may be the sickest of them all.

27:58.310 --> 28:03.230
Well, sick or no, many would
argue it's a victimless crime.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.980
- What's victimless about lynette hagen?
- Who?

28:07.230 --> 28:09.430
Or melissa st. Claire.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.540
I don't know these women,
ok?You have the wrong--

28:11.560 --> 28:13.650
the wrong necrophile?

28:13.660 --> 28:18.560
What, you think I'm the only guy in
town who likes to crack open a cold one?

28:20.160 --> 28:22.620
Where is brooke lombardini?

28:22.640 --> 28:24.940
I don't know who that is.

28:24.970 --> 28:28.300
I don't kill people.

28:32.640 --> 28:38.050
These, uh, profilers say our killer is
trying to turn these girls into a loved one.

28:38.060 --> 28:41.810
Like a wife or a mom.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.320
Is your, uh, mother a blonde, ivan?

28:45.330 --> 28:46.710
That's disgusting.

28:46.740 --> 28:50.110
The wig isn't even the important part.

28:51.670 --> 28:54.110
For me it's--it's
the shoes.

28:54.130 --> 28:56.220
So you put shoes on them, too.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.650
They're a very special pair.

28:58.660 --> 29:01.120
What's special about them?

29:01.150 --> 29:03.680
The woman walked in them.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.040
Sunny raines.

29:05.060 --> 29:06.890
The weather girl?

29:06.910 --> 29:10.610
She was a local celebrity killed in
a car accident a couple of years ago.

29:10.620 --> 29:13.140
A friend of mine was working
when she came in on a slab.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.910
He knew I was a fan.

29:14.930 --> 29:18.890
Oh, so... He stole her shoes for you.

29:19.290 --> 29:23.130
The wig, it just completed
the look, but the shoes...

29:23.890 --> 29:26.610
Genuine article.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.520
That's what makes it real.

29:28.550 --> 29:30.730
Genuine article.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.380
Reid.

29:34.410 --> 29:36.250
I took a report of a grave robbery.

29:36.270 --> 29:38.030
I thought you said it
was just a simple theft.

29:38.050 --> 29:39.240
Yeah, but listen to what was taken.

29:39.270 --> 29:42.950
A dress, a pair of diamond earrings,
and a pair of pearl earrings.

29:42.970 --> 29:43.900
2 pair.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.230
If our unsub is like bakunas,

29:45.240 --> 29:49.360
Then he needs the genuine articles from the true
object of his affection to complete the fantasy.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.330
Exactly. This grave could
belong to that woman.

29:52.340 --> 29:55.940
Let's see. Abigail hansen.

29:55.950 --> 29:58.110
Ok, so I got her obit from the olympian.

29:58.140 --> 30:03.390
Abigail reina hansen died suddenly at
26 from myocarditis, a heart defect.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.870
Sending her passport photo now.

30:06.950 --> 30:09.540
Well, she certainly looks the part.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.490
Garcia, what else can
you tell us about her?

30:11.520 --> 30:15.310
I can tell you that she was born
in amsterdam, she never married,

30:15.340 --> 30:20.480
And her employment records show her working for
patrick and leona gless from 1985 to her death in 1992.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.450
Can you get us an address
for the gless family?

30:22.470 --> 30:24.440
They might be the only ones
who can tell us who abigail was.

30:24.450 --> 30:25.550
Yeah.

30:25.560 --> 30:30.120
"this is the most beautiful place I could
ever hope to live, said the troll's daughter."

30:30.140 --> 30:34.450
"the youth and his sweetheart entered the
castle,which was now theirs, and held their wedding."

30:34.460 --> 30:37.530
"now all the kings roundabout
who had been in the troll's debt

30:37.570 --> 30:41.990
And were now out of it came to the wedding"
"and saluted the youth as their emperor.

30:42.020 --> 30:44.370
Long live the king!"

30:44.400 --> 30:47.120
- "and he ruled over them all And kept peace in the kingdom"
- abby.

30:47.130 --> 30:51.180
"and lived in his castle with his
beautiful empress happily ever after.

30:51.190 --> 30:53.550
The end."

31:10.400 --> 31:13.990
And as soon as she accepts her
new role, her fate is sealed.

31:20.600 --> 31:24.120
Did garcia say what Mr.
Gless does for a living?

31:24.130 --> 31:26.380
Failed artist.

31:26.390 --> 31:29.190
Guess that's what they call failing up

31:29.220 --> 31:31.400
or marrying well.

31:33.060 --> 31:36.170
I think about abigail from time time.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.360
She was such a nice girl.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.060
She was like one of the family.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.870
Was that why you paid for the funeral?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.710
She didn't have anyone else.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.370
She was from denmark.

31:45.380 --> 31:46.880
Holland, dear.

31:46.910 --> 31:48.540
What kind of work did she do for you?

31:48.580 --> 31:50.060
She was the au pair.

31:50.110 --> 31:51.860
And there was some cooking and cleaning.

31:51.890 --> 31:53.050
She took care of the children?

31:53.080 --> 31:56.120
- Just the one-- our
son roderick. - Here.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.380
This is the two of them together.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.410
They were close.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.340
She basically raised the boy.

32:15.370 --> 32:17.580
Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.

32:17.590 --> 32:20.420
No? What would you call it?

32:20.860 --> 32:23.990
Patrick likes to think
he was a good father.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.680
So...

32:27.710 --> 32:31.010
Why do you want to know about abigail?

32:31.610 --> 32:35.180
We believe that there may be a
connection to some recent murders.

32:35.190 --> 32:37.290
Someone she knew.

32:37.310 --> 32:40.490
How old was your son when abigail died?

32:40.500 --> 32:42.670
9.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.810
we weren't here when it happened.

32:46.850 --> 32:48.810
We were on a cruise.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.080
But roderick was here with abigail?

32:51.110 --> 32:54.100
When we returned, we
knew something was wrong.

32:54.130 --> 32:56.470
The smell.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.660
They were in his room on the floor.

32:58.690 --> 33:00.380
He was...

33:00.420 --> 33:04.010
Curled up next to her,
with her arms around him.

33:04.020 --> 33:06.850
It's how he got to sleep.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.590
How long had she been dead?

33:08.620 --> 33:11.280
The coroner said 2, maybe 3 days.

33:11.310 --> 33:13.370
I didn't have the
stomach for the details.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.100
We'd like to speak to roderick.

33:15.130 --> 33:17.950
Well, if I knew where he
was i'd be happy to tell you.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.020
But we haven't spoken for years.

33:20.060 --> 33:26.260
When he turned 21, he dropped out of
medical school, liquidated his trust fund.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.720
We knew he was troubled.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.960
But I had no idea he
would ever hurt someone.

33:30.980 --> 33:34.060
They don't know
for sure that he's--

33:36.480 --> 33:39.510
y-you don't know for sure.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.280
When was your last communication?

33:41.300 --> 33:43.960
We got a letter about a year ago.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.040
Can we borrow this?

33:53.080 --> 33:54.860
You can have it.

33:54.880 --> 33:58.020
And while you're at it, take this, too.

34:01.230 --> 34:02.170
It's exactly how they said.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.190
Roderick's trust was emptied in
march of '04. Half a million bucks.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.130
Where is he now?

34:06.170 --> 34:08.739
Sir, the thing is, he's
gotta be using straight cash,

34:08.770 --> 34:11.159
'Cause there's no paper trail
on him for the last 4 years.

34:11.190 --> 34:12.820
Nothing from the i.r.s., from the dmv.

34:12.860 --> 34:14.929
There's no property or
utilities in his name.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.370
You can't find him?

34:16.400 --> 34:18.020
I'm sorry.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.020
You know, a half a million
isn't what it used to be.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.679
And the way this unsub
is accustomed to living,

34:21.719 --> 34:24.810
After 4 years he would need
to supplement his income.

34:25.179 --> 34:27.219
Anything between the lines, reid?

34:27.250 --> 34:29.340
Nothing that points
to a specific location.

34:29.370 --> 34:31.540
He's basically saying he's happy.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.250
That should be enough for her.
It's essentially a goodbye letter.

34:34.260 --> 34:35.530
Enough for her?

34:36.380 --> 34:38.510
It's only addressed to leona.

34:38.540 --> 34:39.550
Why not his dad?

34:39.590 --> 34:40.880
Maybe they didn't get along.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.360
No, that's not right.

34:44.130 --> 34:47.300
Garcia, I need you to
check something else.

34:47.830 --> 34:50.300
So basically we got nothing.

35:20.540 --> 35:22.710
I missed you.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.450
Me, too.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.280
Drink.

35:43.990 --> 35:46.600
It's the last time.

35:46.610 --> 35:49.190
Promise?

35:49.840 --> 35:52.370
Promise.

35:57.290 --> 35:59.520
The whole thing.

36:12.440 --> 36:15.080
It's a surprise.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.680
What is this place?

36:31.700 --> 36:33.980
It's forever.

37:15.380 --> 37:16.440
Water.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.440
That's what he said.
Roderick is near water.

37:18.450 --> 37:21.570
It's not very specific. The
earth is two-thirds water.

37:21.580 --> 37:23.710
He specified a rocky
shoreline you could see.

37:23.730 --> 37:26.730
Jj, this man is not exactly a
reliable source of information.

37:26.740 --> 37:29.590
Ok.This photo from
the gless house--

37:29.600 --> 37:33.140
it was taken at their
house on mercer island.

37:33.150 --> 37:34.810
Waterfront property.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.560
No one's lived there for 10
years. It's abandoned. I checked.

37:37.570 --> 37:39.700
This could be where he's holding brooke.

37:39.730 --> 37:42.130
- He's sending him money.
- What'shat?

37:42.140 --> 37:43.220
Roderick's dad.

37:43.240 --> 37:46.030
It's the reason roderick never
said goodbye to him in the letter.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.720
They never lost contact.

37:47.750 --> 37:50.270
That supplemental income
you were asking about?

37:50.290 --> 37:53.520
This is it. Every 6
months, a $50,000 wire.

37:53.530 --> 37:56.440
This is western union, though. There's
no way to tell he's on the receiving end.

37:56.450 --> 37:58.140
I'm telling you, he's
sending it to roderick.

37:58.170 --> 37:59.900
If you'd seen his father, you'd know.

37:59.930 --> 38:02.730
It's true. Deep down, he was
very guilty about neglecting him.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.570
He's submissive in the marriage.
He's probably ing it behind her back.

38:05.580 --> 38:06.970
You don't think his dad knew?

38:06.980 --> 38:10.370
No. No, I think he's a sad man
trying to buy his kid's love.

38:10.990 --> 38:13.490
This is where brooke's
911 call originated.

38:13.510 --> 38:15.930
This western union is within the circle.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.030
Mercer island isn't.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.600
We've got a location.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.270
Abby!

39:53.870 --> 39:57.570
Abby!

40:02.990 --> 40:03.850
Is she alive?

40:03.880 --> 40:05.870
Paramedics!

40:06.860 --> 40:09.080
He uses a barbiturate.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.610
Start 2 large-bore
i.v.s.narcan, 2 milligraMs.

40:37.450 --> 40:40.110
Some psychic this guy is.

40:40.120 --> 40:43.960
This place is as far from a
rocky shoreline as you can get.

40:44.590 --> 40:46.520
Dave.

40:57.170 --> 41:01.410
"for those who believe,
"no proof is necessary.

41:01.420 --> 41:06.090
For those who don't
believe," no proof is possible

41:06.400 --> 41:08.360
stuart chase.

41:08.370 --> 41:10.030
Watch your step there.

41:10.050 --> 41:12.480
- Easy, now.
- Honey.

41:17.340 --> 41:18.580
Brooke.

41:18.590 --> 41:20.490
She's gonna be ok.

41:43.550 --> 41:45.680
You're in early.

41:47.010 --> 41:49.450
Couldn't sleep.

41:50.370 --> 41:54.250
I know how it can be coming back here.

41:54.260 --> 41:56.200
The bad things seem worse.

41:56.230 --> 41:58.330
You want easy answers.

41:58.370 --> 42:00.930
If you're gonna tell me not to
believe in psychics, you don't have to.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.660
You can believe in what you want.

42:02.700 --> 42:06.470
But when you're here, you need
to have faith in what we do.

42:06.500 --> 42:09.060
It works.

42:09.070 --> 42:13.940
I just... I saw a mother
losing her child, and, uh...

42:14.890 --> 42:16.180
We didn't have any other leads.

42:16.190 --> 42:17.550
I thought, what harm could it do?

42:17.590 --> 42:19.660
I asked the same question once.

42:19.690 --> 42:20.480
You did?

42:20.500 --> 42:23.230
It was a kidnapping case in georgia.

42:23.270 --> 42:25.780
We had nothing, time was running out,

42:25.800 --> 42:29.330
and there was a local
woman known for her...

42:29.370 --> 42:31.490
Abilities.

42:31.500 --> 42:36.660
On her advice, we took the
investigation in the wrong direction.

42:38.050 --> 42:40.590
The boy died.

42:41.020 --> 42:42.970
I'm sorry.

42:42.990 --> 42:45.580
It was a long time ago.

42:47.950 --> 42:50.540
Well, we won this time.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.540
That's what matters, right?

42:54.070 --> 42:56.290
