00:00.001 --> 00:03.002
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, boy, oh, boy.</i>
<i>Lots to catch up on.</i>

00:03.004 --> 00:04.269
<i>We'll start with the basics.</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:05.304
<i>Jane was accidentally</i>

00:05.306 --> 00:06.472
<i>Artificially inseminated</i>

00:06.474 --> 00:07.773
<i>With rafael's sample.</i>

00:07.775 --> 00:09.375
<i>Oh, and the doctor</i>
<i>who inseminated her?</i>

00:09.377 --> 00:12.277
<i>Well, that was</i>
<i>his sister, luisa.</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:14.446
<i>Bright side:</i>
<i>They'd fall in love.</i>

00:14.448 --> 00:17.082
<i>But happily ever after?</i>
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

00:17.084 --> 00:19.218
<i>For one,</i>
<i>jane's ex-fiancÃ© michael</i>

00:19.220 --> 00:21.520
<i>Is a detective, and he's made</i>
<i>a shocking discovery.</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:24.023
Rafael told us the
bellboy's last words

00:24.025 --> 00:25.324
Were "sin rostro."

00:25.326 --> 00:27.059
He wasn't naming
his killer,

00:27.061 --> 00:28.527
He was
identifying her.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.397
<i>Rafael's stepmother, rose,</i>
<i>is sin rostro,</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:33.399
<i>The big, bad criminal</i>
<i>he's been after.</i>

00:33.401 --> 00:34.400
Oh...

00:34.402 --> 00:35.434
<i>And she killed his father.</i>

00:35.436 --> 00:37.169
(screams)

00:38.505 --> 00:40.472
<i>But rafael</i>
<i>doesn't know that... Yet.</i>

00:40.474 --> 00:43.475
<i>Meanwhile, luisa</i>
<i>was sleeping with rose.</i>

00:43.477 --> 00:45.110
We still have to tell my father

00:45.112 --> 00:46.712
What happened between us.
What?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.180
My shaman thinks
it's really important

00:48.182 --> 00:49.548
For me to just come clean.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.550
Latin lover narrator:
<i>So rose had her committed.</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:53.685
You're having
some sort of episode.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.055
Fantasizing...
Stop lying!

00:56.057 --> 00:58.357
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, and even more scandalous,</i>

00:58.359 --> 01:00.559
<i>Remember roman zazo,</i>
<i>who was impaled?</i>

01:00.561 --> 01:02.094
<i>Well, this just happened:</i>

01:02.096 --> 01:03.328
Did everything go okay?

01:03.330 --> 01:05.431
Yeah.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.099
<i>So let's see what the hell</i>
<i>is going on, shall we?</i>

01:07.101 --> 01:08.500
Great.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.602
<i>There's an old</i>
<i>woody allan quote:</i>

01:10.604 --> 01:12.538
"if you want to make god laugh,

01:12.540 --> 01:15.474
<i>Tell him about your plans."</i>

01:15.476 --> 01:17.776
<i>And though</i>
<i>I have complicated feelings</i>

01:17.778 --> 01:20.279
<i>About woody allan,</i>
<i>post-soon-yi,</i>

01:20.281 --> 01:21.680
<i>It's still a very wise quote.</i>

01:21.682 --> 01:23.682
Okay, I made a decision.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.317
Ready?

01:25.319 --> 01:26.819
<i>Lista.</i>
<i>We're ready.</i>

01:26.821 --> 01:30.522
I'm going to go to
the university of miami.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.757
Wow.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.759
I thought you were
leaning towards iowa.

01:33.761 --> 01:37.763
Yeah, well, I weighed everything

01:37.765 --> 01:39.665
And miami makes the most sense.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.234
I can write on the side while
I'm getting my teaching degree,

01:42.236 --> 01:44.570
Plus if I live at home,
then I'll save money,

01:44.572 --> 01:47.639
Which will put me a little ahead
on my five-year plan.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.675
You don't even
have a plan.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.710
Well, that's
not true, dad.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.512
I plan to go
to bora bora next week.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.214
Bora bora? When
are you going

01:55.216 --> 01:57.349
To get your life together?
Look at your sister.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.684
Even she is on
the right path.

01:58.686 --> 01:59.818
Luisa:
No, thank you.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.887
I'm newly sober
and they say alcoholics

02:01.889 --> 02:03.722
Either end up in rehab,
in jail or dead.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.424
I chose rehab.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.292
There is no need to give them
every single detail, luisa.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.862
In any case,
you need a job.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.763
No, I really don't.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.599
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely working
while I'm in college.

02:13.601 --> 02:14.766
I mean, it may take
a little longer,

02:14.768 --> 02:16.702
But I don't want
to graduate with debt.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.904
Then I'm going
to cut you off.
That's ridiculous.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.806
You're lazy.
You're unmotivated.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.742
By 30, I see myself
tenured at a school,

02:23.744 --> 02:25.777
My first novel
about to be published...

02:28.281 --> 02:30.582
Definitely married
but no kids yet.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.718
I want my life set up first.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.786
You've done nothing
with your life.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.755
You've accomplished
nothing.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.423
Can I just say

02:38.425 --> 02:40.726
How proud I am
of you, honey?

02:40.728 --> 02:43.328
You are such a
disappointment.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.463
Thanks, dad.
Thanks, mom.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.764
It means a lot.
It means a lot.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.433
Rafael:
<i>Wow.</i>

02:48.435 --> 02:49.835
Babies need
a lot of gear.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.304
No, they don't. It's all
marketing, all right?

02:52.306 --> 02:54.173
They act like you need all this
stuff, when really, you just...

02:54.175 --> 02:57.809
That little snowsuit
with the little ears.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.611
We live in miami.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.914
I was just saying
that it was cute.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.883
Do I get to come in and make,
like, a grand entrance

03:04.885 --> 03:07.519
And play cutesy games
or whatever?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.820
I don't do games.
You know what, I don't even know

03:08.822 --> 03:10.689
What half of these things are.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.324
And the other half,
I'm not registering for them

03:12.326 --> 03:13.692
Until I read a review.
You read reviews?

03:13.694 --> 03:14.726
I read multiple reviews.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.628
And I review.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.597
Of course you do.
(laughs)

03:19.899 --> 03:21.433
Okay, come on.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.668
Let's look at something
we know we need.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.703
Cribs.
Cribs, okay.
Cribs are cute.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.605
Yes. Just definitely
not that one.
Oh, I love that one.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.806
Really?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.708
What's wrong
with this one?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.510
J... It... The bars...

03:31.512 --> 03:33.278
It's just so prison-like.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.747
But they all have bars.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.816
Well, then, I want the <i>orange</i>
<i>is the new black</i> version.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.718
A friendly prison,

03:39.720 --> 03:42.454
Where one has a chance
to explore their identity.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.689
Although, we could
just get 'em both.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.424
One for your place,
one for mine.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.692
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And just like that,</i>

03:46.694 --> 03:47.926
<i>A terrifying thought</i>

03:47.928 --> 03:51.597
<i>Occurred to them both.</i>

03:51.599 --> 03:54.266
<i>Well, maybe not terrifying,</i>
<i>but expensive.</i>

03:54.268 --> 03:56.301
(knocking at door)
I got it.

03:57.704 --> 03:58.737
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, michael.</i>

03:58.739 --> 04:00.639
Hi.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.673
<i>You'll recall that,</i>
<i>up until recently,</i>

04:01.675 --> 04:03.008
<i>Michael had plans of his own.</i>

04:06.613 --> 04:07.779
What's going on?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.514
Did you find my father?

04:09.516 --> 04:10.782
No.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.618
But I do need to talk to you.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.019
About... Sin rostro.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.390
Should I leave, or...

04:18.392 --> 04:19.958
Depends how much
you want her to hear.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.793
Everything.

04:21.795 --> 04:22.828
Anything.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.363
Stay.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.999
Sin rostro is your stepmother,
rose.

04:28.968 --> 04:30.402
Wow.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.703
Um...

04:31.705 --> 04:34.006
Let's... Let's sit down.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.577
So how do you know
that it's rose?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.345
Are you sure?

04:40.347 --> 04:41.580
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I don't want to interrupt,</i>

04:41.582 --> 04:42.981
<i>But I do think it's important</i>

04:42.983 --> 04:44.750
<i>That you know</i>
<i>what jane's thinking.</i>

04:44.752 --> 04:46.652
Michael: All the
evidence leads to her.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.719
She's been running
an underground

04:47.721 --> 04:49.054
Plastic surgery
ring.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.392
She's been surgically changing
the faces of criminals.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.361
We have reason to
believe she may have

04:56.363 --> 04:57.462
Altered her
own face.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.868
If rose altered
her own face,

05:02.870 --> 05:05.003
She could look
entirely different.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.407
She could be...
Anyone.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.776
At least you know
my father's not involved.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.678
I don't know
that at all.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.846
Sin rostro had a
network of associates,

05:14.848 --> 05:18.717
And your father could
have been one of them.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.485
What are you implying?

05:20.487 --> 05:21.753
I'm implying exactly what
you know I'm implying.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.788
(grunts)

05:22.790 --> 05:24.489
Rose didn't
kill roman zazo

05:24.491 --> 05:25.724
And your father
is still at large.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.959
So if he contacts you,
you let us know.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.495
You, too, jane.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.832
Rafael:
Jane?
Huh?

05:34.901 --> 05:36.868
Sorry.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.704
Can you repeat the question?

05:45.945 --> 05:47.713
I'm gonna need to talk
to your sister, too.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.081
How can I reach her?

05:49.083 --> 05:51.850
She's at haven view
psychiatric hospital.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.884
What's she
doing there?

05:52.886 --> 05:56.822
Um... She had
a breakdown.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.790
Claimed she was having
an affair with rose.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.125
Michael:
You mean sin rostro.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.761
Oh, my god,
rafael...

06:02.763 --> 06:04.062
I-I gotta get her
out of there.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.530
All right, betty...

06:05.532 --> 06:06.898
I'm breaking out of here.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.433
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Poor luisa.</i>

06:08.435 --> 06:10.702
Always one crucial step behind.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.671
I am. I've had it.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.606
No phone privileges,
are you kidding me?

06:14.608 --> 06:16.808
Just because of
one little incident?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.377
(calmly):
This is an emergency.

06:18.379 --> 06:21.513
I need you to go
to the marbella hotel.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.149
I think my father might be
a criminal mastermind

06:24.151 --> 06:25.751
And I'm worried
that my stepmother

06:25.753 --> 06:27.052
Is in imminent danger.

06:28.988 --> 06:30.756
Yes, I am calling

06:30.758 --> 06:33.625
From the haven view
psychiatric hospital.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.895
This is the key to my escape.

06:38.164 --> 06:41.166
Don't tell anyone, betty.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.402
I have to get
out of here.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.103
As long as rose is
with my father, she's...

06:45.105 --> 06:46.772
She's in danger.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.940
Look, I know what
you're going to say.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.643
Why am I trying to help rose,
after what she did?

06:51.645 --> 06:52.944
Putting me in here...

06:52.946 --> 06:54.579
I should hate her for that.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.848
I do hate her for that.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.951
Yeah, I know.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.653
I don't believe me either.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.888
Xiomara:
<i>Wait, so his stepmother's</i>

07:02.890 --> 07:04.790
Like a real-life
criminal mastermind?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.925
Yes.
Wow.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.560
That's like straight
out of <i>la reina del sur.</i>

07:08.562 --> 07:10.629
Right?
Like when teresa
mendoza turns into

07:10.631 --> 07:11.930
This huge drug queen
and she ends up killing teo...

07:11.932 --> 07:13.732
Exactly, that's exactly
what I was thinking!

07:13.734 --> 07:14.800
But I couldn't tell rafael that.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.101
So what did you say?

07:16.103 --> 07:17.669
Oh, something about

07:17.671 --> 07:18.904
I'm sure his father
will turn up.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.139
So you think he knows
where his father is?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.475
What? No...
It's not out of the question.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.910
You'd hide me
if I were a criminal.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.712
No, I wouldn't.
I'd hide you
if you were a criminal.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.681
That's because I wouldn't
do something that bad.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.949
And you think I would?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.185
Example "a," you
have a temper.

07:33.187 --> 07:34.686
Rogelio:
Oh, hello.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.922
Please, don't
let my mood

07:36.924 --> 07:38.757
Interrupt your
good times.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.591
Hey, rogelio.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.826
Dad.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.860
You're locked into "dad" now.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.695
Dad. Got it.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.498
I wanted to talk
to you both

07:46.500 --> 07:49.000
About my job
offer in mexico.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.937
I am being pressured by
my publicist to take it.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.575
So... You're
leaving for mexico?

07:58.578 --> 08:00.512
I don't know.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.581
I-I also got a job offer

08:02.583 --> 08:04.616
Here.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.984
To play the second lead

08:05.986 --> 08:07.118
In esteban's telenovela.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.989
Their ratings need a boost.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.959
Normally, I would never
consider it, but...

08:13.961 --> 08:17.863
Well, we've just connected.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.965
And I don't want to lose that.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.934
We won't.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.836
Look, I selfishly
want you to stay.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.073
But... If you want to
go for your career...

08:28.075 --> 08:30.141
I get it.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.814
Anyway, I'm tired,
so I'm gonna go to bed.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.116
I'll leave you guys to talk.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.885
Night, hon.
Mm-hmm.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.253
Good night.
Night.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.828
So, what are you
going to do?

08:49.830 --> 08:51.029
I'm not sure.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.733
What do you think
I should do?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.134
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Here's what he hoped</i>
<i>she would say:</i>

08:56.136 --> 08:58.970
Stay here.
With me.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.706
<i>And... Here's what she said:</i>

09:01.708 --> 09:03.975
You should do
whatever makes you happy.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.713
What would make you happy?

09:08.715 --> 09:10.081
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Here's what she hoped</i>
<i>he would say:</i>

09:10.083 --> 09:11.716
You, xiomara.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.919
<i>And... Here's what he said:</i>

09:13.921 --> 09:16.087
Neither option is perfect.

09:20.927 --> 09:24.596
Take everything up to
the presidential suite.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.164
I'll be staying
there for a while.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.569
Gabriel:
Mrs. Solano...

09:30.571 --> 09:32.103
Mrs. Solano, wait.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.039
The thing is...

09:34.041 --> 09:37.242
Mr. Solano, well...

09:37.244 --> 09:39.578
He's banned you
from the hotel, ma'am.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.646
Hmm. Did he?

09:41.648 --> 09:43.682
And what is
your name?

09:43.684 --> 09:44.950
Gabriel.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.284
Excellent.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.653
Gabriel, can you tell me
exactly what he said?

09:48.655 --> 09:49.988
Great, as long as
he got the money,

09:49.990 --> 09:52.257
I want out of
this whole mess.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.326
And clearly,
use discretion

09:54.328 --> 09:56.595
When wiring the last of it
so nothing can be traced.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.063
So you think he knows
where his father is?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.800
Just let me know
if anything changes.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.702
Yeah. So we're all good.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.170
All right. Bye-bye.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.638
Hey.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.139
Hey...

10:08.141 --> 10:10.108
What was that all about?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.643
Uh, luisa.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.044
I have to get her
out of the hospital,

10:13.046 --> 10:14.779
But I need
the power of attorney.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.914
Latin lover narrator:
<i>This was absolutely true.</i>

10:20.286 --> 10:21.720
I have to make
another call

10:21.722 --> 10:23.021
About it, actually.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.656
Yeah. I have to get to work.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.191
Yeah, uh,
we have a meeting, so...

10:26.193 --> 10:27.792
Okay.
Okay.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.628
I'll see you.
Mm-hmm.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.798
Hello, jane.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.800
Oh, hi.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.002
I thought you left.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.637
Oh, I did.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.105
But I'm back.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.643
What are you doing here, petra?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.011
I banned you from this hotel.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.212
Hmm, yes, I know.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.647
The manager, uh...

10:48.649 --> 10:50.048
Gabriel was his name, right?

10:50.050 --> 10:51.049
Yeah, anyway, he told me.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.884
Then I fired him.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.053
Consider it my first act
as co-owner of the marbella.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.354
What?

10:56.356 --> 10:59.090
Oh, didn't you know?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.892
Yes, well...

11:00.894 --> 11:03.094
The company that bought into
the hotel, stanwyk investments--

11:03.096 --> 11:04.295
It's a family
company.

11:04.297 --> 11:08.166
My old boyfriend's
family.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.368
And, well,
he bought it for me.

11:11.904 --> 11:14.105
So we need to talk
about some changes, hmm?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.107
The hotel's reputation
has taken a hit.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.677
And I believe
that the first step

11:18.679 --> 11:20.111
Towards changing
public perception is

11:20.113 --> 11:22.180
To distance ourselves
from the solano name.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.449
Meaning, stripping you from your
day-to-day responsibilities.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.251
What are you talking
about, petra?

11:26.253 --> 11:30.321
I believe the term
is "silent partner."

11:31.123 --> 11:32.424
Shh...

11:32.426 --> 11:35.427
This man, emilio solano,

11:35.429 --> 11:38.129
Is potentially armed
and dangerous.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.864
If anyone sees
or hears anything...

11:39.866 --> 11:42.167
So listen, we need to have a
meeting asap about your shower.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.002
Okay, don't make
a big thing about it.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.737
I'm gonna make a
big thing about it.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.307
That's it.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.943
Just keep your eyes open.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.212
Thank you.

11:56.415 --> 11:57.982
I'm sorry about that.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.784
Jane, I meant
it before.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.086
Emilio might try to
reach out to his son,

12:01.088 --> 12:03.088
And if he does,
we need to know.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.322
Great, as long
as he got the money,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.491
I want out of this mess.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.493
What is it?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.161
Nothing.
Jane.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.363
This isn't about rafael
or you or me, okay?

12:12.365 --> 12:13.732
It's about this.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.799
Ugh.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.034
Roman zazo
was murdered.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.235
And his killer is
still out there.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.806
So be careful,
okay?

12:21.808 --> 12:25.043
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted that jane's</i>
<i>first thought was rafael.</i>

12:25.045 --> 12:27.045
<i>She really needed</i>
<i>to talk to him.</i>

12:27.047 --> 12:29.247
<i>But then this happened.</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:31.249
No one knows
you're here, okay?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.251
Get some rest.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.421
<i>Okay, that absolutely did not</i>
<i>mean he was hiding emilio.</i>

12:36.423 --> 12:37.489
(elevator dings)

12:39.258 --> 12:41.459
<i>And it's certainly not like</i>
<i>jane should get</i>

12:41.461 --> 12:43.461
<i>The master key and break in.</i>

12:43.463 --> 12:45.096
<i>That would be ridiculous.</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:48.099
<i>And dangerous.</i>

12:48.101 --> 12:49.534
<i>She should definitely leave.</i>

12:49.536 --> 12:51.803
<i>Right now.</i>

12:51.805 --> 12:54.038
<i>But there's no harm</i>
<i>in knocking, right?</i>

12:58.844 --> 13:00.211
Man: Did you
forget something?

13:11.023 --> 13:12.857
Jane.

13:12.859 --> 13:13.858
Michael, hi.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.326
A-are you okay?
What's wrong?

13:15.328 --> 13:16.494
Nothing.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.829
You always look away

13:17.831 --> 13:19.030
When you're not
telling the truth.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.899
I just was... I was
looking for rafael.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.133
And you look scared.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.068
Is this about his father,
about the case?

13:24.070 --> 13:26.871
Jane.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.239
Roman zazo's murderer
is on the loose.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.241
But I just saw him.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.845
Hi, michael.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.413
Hi, jane.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.915
Hi.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.286
What the hell
is going on?

13:42.488 --> 13:44.856
I'm aaron zazo.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.424
Aaron?
Yeah.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.393
I'm roman's
twin brother.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.864
I'm so sorry
I scared you.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.966
I figured you were someone
who knew my brother,

13:54.968 --> 13:56.868
But I didn't know
who you were.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.870
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.940
I used to have sisters
that are twins.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.142
One of them has a bigger
dimple, I think, maybe.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.977
Look, start at the beginning.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.478
What is going on?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.281
After zaz died, I knew
I had to find his brother.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.916
But they hadn't
spoken in years,

14:11.918 --> 14:13.518
And I didn't know
where to start.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.887
So I hired a private
investigator,

14:15.889 --> 14:18.022
And eventually I tracked aaron
down to an orphanage

14:18.024 --> 14:19.858
In mexico
where he volunteered.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.993
But he had just been
kidnapped by a cartel.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.094
Aaron:
It happens down there.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.929
They grab you,
demand cash.
I negotiated

14:24.931 --> 14:27.432
With the cartel.
I owe this man
my life.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.634
He's one of the good
guys, jane.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.136
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

14:32.138 --> 14:34.138
Because the kidnappers
demanded secrecy.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.974
They said they were
gonna kill him.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.610
I need to talk to you
about your brother.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.612
Absolutely.
Satya.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.148
It means, "all
in pursuit of truth."

14:44.150 --> 14:45.550
It's a part
of my religion.

14:50.389 --> 14:54.058
I just want to know
what happened to my brother.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.897
I'm sorry.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.131
L-look, I...

15:00.133 --> 15:01.532
I was looking for you.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.967
But I ran into
michael instead.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.235
I tried not to
say anything,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.070
But he just, he
knows me so well.
God.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.273
And I was scared.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.275
I thought that I
just saw a dead man.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.110
And what were you doing
even knocking

15:12.112 --> 15:14.178
On the door
in the first place, huh?

15:16.382 --> 15:17.982
I saw you come out,

15:17.984 --> 15:19.984
And you put a "do not
disturb" sign on,

15:19.986 --> 15:21.419
And you had that
weird call earlier,

15:21.421 --> 15:23.421
And I just...

15:23.423 --> 15:25.290
I thought that maybe
your father was in there.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.425
What?
But I didn't
really think that.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.960
I just...

15:28.962 --> 15:30.428
I couldn't rule it out
a hundred percent.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.496
Because you don't
trust me.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.931
No, I do.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.232
Really?

15:34.234 --> 15:36.034
'cause it doesn't
feel like it.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.535
(phone buzzes)

15:39.505 --> 15:41.673
Can we just talk
about this later?

15:41.675 --> 15:44.175
I have to get my sister out
of the mental institution.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.279
All right, this is
how I'm gonna bust out.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.948
You know dan,
the hot delivery guy?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.950
<i>Yeah, I know, I don't see</i>

15:51.952 --> 15:53.151
<i>Why everyone thinks</i>
<i>he's so hot.</i>

15:53.153 --> 15:54.686
<i>He's so basic.</i>
<i>Anyway,</i>

15:54.688 --> 15:56.120
Every other Friday,

15:56.122 --> 15:58.022
Dan delivers supplies
to our floor.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.090
<i>And nurse chelsea--</i>

15:59.092 --> 16:00.425
<i>I know, she's so tragic,</i>

16:00.427 --> 16:02.961
<i>She just reeks of desperation.</i>

16:02.963 --> 16:04.996
<i>Anyway, she's always</i>
<i>flirting with dan.</i>

16:04.998 --> 16:07.398
<i>So all I have to do</i>
<i>is sneak by them</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:09.233
<i>While chelsea's distracted.</i>

16:09.235 --> 16:12.503
<i>And then I can use</i>
<i>rose's brooch</i>

16:12.505 --> 16:14.505
<i>To pick the lock</i>
<i>by the back door</i>

16:14.507 --> 16:17.108
<i>And voilÃ -- I'm free.</i>

16:27.619 --> 16:30.188
(screams)

16:31.190 --> 16:32.590
(sighs)

16:32.592 --> 16:35.226
Luisa?

16:36.428 --> 16:38.262
Hey,

16:38.264 --> 16:39.430
You.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.099
What are you
doing here?

16:41.101 --> 16:44.102
I finally got power
of attorney.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.137
I'm here
to sign you out.

16:46.139 --> 16:49.140
Great.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.142
Let's go back
in this way.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.244
It's a shortcut.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.219
Ah...

17:01.221 --> 17:04.222
We're all responsible
for our own baggage.

17:04.224 --> 17:07.058
At least that's what I learned
in the mental hospital.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.760
Luisa?
What?

17:12.731 --> 17:14.665
Look, I don't know
what made you change your mind

17:14.667 --> 17:16.367
And decide
to sign me out,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.536
But I cannot believe that...
Rose is sin rostro.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.171
Come again?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.306
Rose, our
stepmother...

17:24.176 --> 17:25.176
...Is sin rostro.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.178
Sin rostro,

17:27.180 --> 17:30.081
Like, that crazy big
drug-dealer person?

17:30.083 --> 17:32.316
Yeah, except she
got out of drugs

17:32.318 --> 17:34.519
And now runs a
plastic surgery ring

17:34.521 --> 17:36.487
That apparently changes
criminals' faces.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.290
You don't say.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.528
Wow.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.264
Sin rostro, like,
killed people, right?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.266
Only those who
really deserved it.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.501
Lu, I am so sorry.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.104
And I believe you now.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.140
That's good,
that's great.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.275
Okay.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.110
I ran everything
by your grandmother,

17:59.112 --> 18:02.113
And we both agreed that
this will be a dry baby shower.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.516
Apparently, we feel
very strongly about this.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.285
It's really sweet what
you're doing for me, lina.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.120
Are you kidding?

18:09.122 --> 18:10.588
Your best friend throws you
your baby shower,

18:10.590 --> 18:12.123
That's the rule.
I know,

18:12.125 --> 18:14.525
But, you know, it's been
kind of weird with us.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.693
Since the whole
frankie thing.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.694
Yeah, I know.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.362
And I missed you.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.363
So...

18:19.365 --> 18:21.666
I missed you, too.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.668
Okay, we'll
hug it out later,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.670
But we have things
to accomplish here.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.306
Okay, did you finish
your target registry?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.174
No.
Jane.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.542
It's complicated.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.177
I mean, where are
we gonna even live?

18:33.179 --> 18:35.179
Do we get two of everything
or one of everything?

18:35.181 --> 18:36.881
Hmm, I didn't think
about that.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.516
Okay, we'll just
say "cash."

18:38.518 --> 18:40.485
Next up--
party game.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.253
Oh, god, I hate
party games.
I know you don't
like party games.

18:43.522 --> 18:46.524
You'll just fill this out
about each other.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.792
Where did you meet?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.394
That'll be funny.

18:50.396 --> 18:53.231
Um, what's
your favorite song?

18:53.233 --> 18:55.266
Oh, and, um,
this is a good one--

18:55.268 --> 18:57.335
Which one of you will be
the disciplinarian?

19:17.789 --> 19:20.791
Rose: <i>Luisa, there is so much</i>
<i>I want to say to you but can't.</i>

19:20.793 --> 19:22.627
<i>So let me say this.</i>

19:22.629 --> 19:24.629
<i>I'm sorry that you were hurt</i>
<i>during all of this.</i>

19:24.631 --> 19:27.265
<i>And I know you have</i>
<i>so many questions,</i>

19:27.267 --> 19:28.900
<i>So I want to answer one.</i>

19:28.902 --> 19:30.902
<i>Unfortunately, your father is</i>

19:30.904 --> 19:33.304
<i>Where the lightning</i>
<i>first struck,</i>

19:33.306 --> 19:35.306
<i>Where there were fireworks.</i>

19:35.308 --> 19:37.308
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Sounds like gibberish to me,</i>

19:37.310 --> 19:39.210
<i>But clearly it meant</i>
<i>something to luisa.</i>

19:42.181 --> 19:43.848
Look, you were right.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.416
I shouldn't have
knocked on that door,

19:45.418 --> 19:47.418
And I should have trusted
you enough to wait

19:47.420 --> 19:48.786
And ask you what
was going on.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.289
But, I mean, can you
blame me, really?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.224
I mean, with everything
that's going on--

19:53.226 --> 19:55.626
I mean, the murders and twins
and mastermind criminals,

19:55.628 --> 19:59.230
This is not normal stuff.
It's pretty friggin' crazy.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.432
Yeah, you're right.

20:01.434 --> 20:05.336
But even with all that,
I thought that you trusted me.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.872
And I do.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.308
For the most part.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.777
Ah, yeah, see,
"for the most part"...

20:12.779 --> 20:14.412
Doesn't feel great.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.280
Yeah, but how can it be
anything more than that?

20:16.282 --> 20:18.382
I mea... I mean, I don't even
know what your favorite song is.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.383
What?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.419
Nothing, oh, it's just

20:21.421 --> 20:23.454
This silly question
on a baby shower game.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.389
The-the point is, is that

20:25.391 --> 20:27.391
I didn't know
any of the answers.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.260
And that's because we just met.
And I know it doesn't

20:29.262 --> 20:31.362
Feel that way
because of everything

20:31.364 --> 20:34.298
We've been dealing with,
but it's the truth.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.401
We did just meet.
And trust takes time.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.571
And you could have
told me about aaron,

20:40.573 --> 20:42.006
But you didn't.
No, and I know
now...

20:42.008 --> 20:43.708
That that was
a matter of his safety,

20:43.710 --> 20:45.743
But I wasn't gonna say anything.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.845
That's fair.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.847
We'll get there.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.916
Yeah, we will.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.456
"livin' on a prayer."

20:59.891 --> 21:01.659
That's your favorite song?

21:01.661 --> 21:02.660
Really?

21:02.662 --> 21:03.928
Bon jovi?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.997
Mm-hmm.
(chuckling):
Oh, no, no.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.365
(phone buzzes)

21:07.367 --> 21:09.333
Hold on.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.402
Hello.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.375
Luisa?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.277
Are you okay?

21:19.279 --> 21:21.012
Hmm, not great.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.481
Luisa, what are you doing
out here?

21:23.483 --> 21:25.449
Rose...

21:25.451 --> 21:28.686
Sin rostro,
I found this letter from her.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.022
Read the last sentence.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.456
I don't know when she left it.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.292
It might've been
when she came to visit.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.961
"your father is where
the lightning first struck.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.496
There were fireworks."

21:38.498 --> 21:39.664
What does that mean?

21:39.666 --> 21:42.800
We made love for the first time
in a pool.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.036
Rafael,

21:45.038 --> 21:47.672
I'm pretty sure right now I'm...

21:47.674 --> 21:49.407
I'm sitting on dad.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.713
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You know that feeling</i>
<i>when you've been up all night</i>

21:55.715 --> 21:57.615
<i>Waiting to find out</i>
<i>if your boyfriend's father</i>

21:57.617 --> 22:01.385
<i>Was dug out</i>
<i>of a reflecting pool?</i>

22:01.387 --> 22:02.953
Sure you don't want
to eat anything?

22:02.955 --> 22:04.855
No, no, no, I'm fine.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.090
<i>Well, that's how</i>
<i>jane's feeling.</i>

22:06.092 --> 22:07.525
(phone rings)

22:08.960 --> 22:11.028
Hello.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.097
This is he.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.600
Okay, thank you.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.572
So, they found him.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.046
I'm so sorry.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.115
Yeah, I, um, I need
to make funeral arrangements

22:31.117 --> 22:33.017
And, uh, call a board meeting.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.086
'cause petra's gonna try
to use this to take control.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.520
So...
You can do that later.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.356
No, I really can't.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.590
I know her;
she's gonna pounce.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.659
I got to be prepared.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.964
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Speaking of prepared,</i>

22:46.966 --> 22:49.100
<i>Luisa was ready</i>
<i>to share everything.</i>

22:49.102 --> 22:51.869
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to tell me everything

22:51.871 --> 22:53.704
That happened between you
and rose.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.072
No detail is too small.

22:55.074 --> 22:59.577
<i>Finally, a chance to tell</i>
<i>the truth</i>

22:59.579 --> 23:01.879
<i>About the greatest love story</i>
<i>ever told.</i>

23:01.881 --> 23:04.482
It all started
about five years ago.

23:06.118 --> 23:09.086
<i>I was sitting alone</i>
<i>at a girl bar,</i>

23:09.088 --> 23:11.789
<i>And then I saw her.</i>

23:11.791 --> 23:15.092
<i>She was wearing</i>
<i>this tight red dress</i>

23:15.094 --> 23:17.128
<i>That highlighted every curve</i>

23:17.130 --> 23:18.529
<i>Of her body,</i>

23:18.531 --> 23:21.532
<i>Her breasts, her hips, her...</i>

23:21.534 --> 23:23.434
Got it. Good.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.936
And then she sat down
next to me.

23:28.106 --> 23:29.940
Hi.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.876
Luisa:
<i>We could both feel it,</i>

23:31.878 --> 23:33.644
<i>That instant attraction.</i>

23:33.646 --> 23:35.045
Can I buy you a drink?

23:35.047 --> 23:37.114
34 days sober.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.150
Gotcha.

23:39.152 --> 23:42.720
I am just getting
out of the drug world myself.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.622
Of course, when she was talking
about the drug world,

23:44.624 --> 23:45.990
She was referring to her former

23:45.992 --> 23:47.691
Half-billion-dollar-a-year
business.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.827
Yeah.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.562
I didn't pick up on that.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.698
<i>I mentioned</i>
<i>the red dress, right?</i>

23:54.700 --> 23:55.666
Yes.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.635
And what happened then?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.203
And then we left.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.173
We just wanted time to be alone.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.141
So how long are you in town?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.877
The weekend.

24:06.879 --> 24:10.714
I'm trying to close this deal,
but my heart's not in it.

24:10.716 --> 24:12.183
Latin lover narrator:
She was trying to close a deal,
<i>all right.</i>

24:12.185 --> 24:14.051
<i>She was dating a man</i>

24:14.053 --> 24:15.486
<i>So she could use his hotel</i>

24:15.488 --> 24:17.721
<i>For her illegal</i>
<i>plastic surgery ring,</i>

24:17.723 --> 24:19.824
<i>And her heart</i>
<i>wasn't in it because,</i>

24:19.826 --> 24:21.725
<i>Well, rose was a lesbian.</i>

24:21.727 --> 24:24.161
I really did not expect this.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.666
I guess you never know when
lightning is gonna strike.

24:29.768 --> 24:32.136
<i>And then she kissed me.</i>

24:32.138 --> 24:33.838
(fireworks exploding)

24:33.840 --> 24:36.173
<i>And then there were fireworks.</i>

24:36.175 --> 24:38.642
Latin lover narrator:
It was also the fourth of July.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.145
Luisa:
<i>And then we made love.</i>

24:41.147 --> 24:43.747
<i>Raw, passionate,</i>
<i>desperate love.</i>

24:43.749 --> 24:46.116
Okay, then what?

24:46.118 --> 24:48.152
We made love again.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.020
Okay, after that?
And yet again.

24:50.022 --> 24:50.988
Michael:
<i>Okay, well,</i>

24:50.990 --> 24:53.190
Let's assume you guys

24:53.192 --> 24:54.825
Had sex a bunch of times.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.126
Can we skip ahead?

24:56.128 --> 24:58.128
I thought
I'd never see her again.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.798
And then I went
to a family dinner that night.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.533
It was a horrible night.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.835
My dad was all over my brother.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.171
You are such a
disappointment.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.239
Thanks, dad.

25:08.241 --> 25:09.540
It means a lot.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.942
Oh, my god.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.210
Oh, good, you made it.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.212
I am so sorry I'm late.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.714
Traffic was terrible.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.215
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes,</i>

25:18.217 --> 25:20.050
<i>The deal rose</i>
<i>was trying to close,</i>

25:20.052 --> 25:21.218
<i>It was emilio.</i>

25:21.220 --> 25:22.820
You're dating my father?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.221
Please lower your voice.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.190
(stammering)

25:26.192 --> 25:28.192
What about last night?

25:28.194 --> 25:31.095
It was a mistake.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.264
I really,
I do have feelings for him.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.298
I...
(groans)

25:34.300 --> 25:36.100
It's getting serious.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.835
Look, I just, I...

25:37.837 --> 25:41.839
I think I needed to be
with a woman

25:41.841 --> 25:43.140
One last time, you know?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.308
Just...

25:44.310 --> 25:45.876
Get it out of my system.

25:47.012 --> 25:49.013
Yeah, I get it.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.215
I mean,
I have a girlfriend anyway.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.717
Her name's allison,

25:53.719 --> 25:55.786
And she loves to have sex
in bathrooms.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.756
Good.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.824
I'm glad.

26:06.765 --> 26:08.799
You have some...

26:08.801 --> 26:11.769
Mashed potatoes on your shirt.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.138
Can I get a glass
of water, please?

26:14.140 --> 26:15.639
Is that allowed?

26:15.641 --> 26:17.675
Again, you're not under arrest.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.610
You can have anything you want.

26:19.612 --> 26:20.644
Jane:
<i>So if you can bring</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:22.079
My black dress in the morning?

26:22.081 --> 26:24.014
Sure, no problem.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.317
Thanks. I just don't want
to leave him alone tonight.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.818
Yeah, I get it.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.887
How's he holding up?

26:33.291 --> 26:34.992
He seems...

26:34.994 --> 26:36.694
Okay right now.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.696
You know,
he's just making arrangements

26:38.698 --> 26:40.698
For the funeral and talking
to his lawyer about business.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.800
Well, people cope
in different ways.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.702
Yeah, I know. I...

26:44.704 --> 26:47.972
I just don't know what he needs

26:47.974 --> 26:50.040
Or how to help him.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.209
Well, just be there for him,
I think.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.377
That's all you can do.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.979
I just...

26:54.981 --> 26:56.847
I did something
really stupid today,

26:56.849 --> 26:58.682
And I-I'm just worried

26:58.684 --> 27:00.017
That he's not gonna
trust me enough

27:00.019 --> 27:02.286
To open up, you know?

27:02.288 --> 27:04.722
For some of us, it's hard,

27:04.724 --> 27:06.790
Talking about feelings
and stuff.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.207
(sighs)

27:23.209 --> 27:25.776
(phone ringing)

27:25.778 --> 27:27.845
(sniffles)

27:29.748 --> 27:31.382
Hello?

27:31.384 --> 27:33.717
Rose:
Luisa?

27:33.719 --> 27:35.919
It's me.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.221
How are you?

27:37.223 --> 27:38.756
How am I?

27:38.758 --> 27:40.724
You put me
in a mental institution.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.326
You killed my father!

27:42.328 --> 27:44.862
I know, and I'm sorry.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.064
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Why are we only seeing</i>
<i>her back?</i>

27:47.066 --> 27:49.166
But this plan, it's been
in the works for years.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.769
<i>Oh, maybe she's changed</i>
<i>her face.</i>

27:51.771 --> 27:53.003
Before we met.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.973
(whispering):
Why are you calling me?

27:55.975 --> 27:58.876
Because how I feel about you,
what we have,

27:58.878 --> 28:00.411
That was the only thing
in my life

28:00.413 --> 28:02.379
This past five years
that was real.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.916
And you once said that you
wanted to run away with me.

28:07.052 --> 28:08.318
Do you still?

28:20.799 --> 28:22.032
You okay?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.767
Yeah.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.936
Petra called a board meeting
an hour from now.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.771
It's a power play.

28:27.773 --> 28:29.206
She's got no shame.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.209
I'm so sorry.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.978
It really was a
beautiful service.

28:37.782 --> 28:40.951
I, um, I need to go talk
to my sister.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.020
Do you mind?
No, of course not.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.861
Mm-hmm.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.799
(sniffling)

28:55.801 --> 28:57.868
(sighs)

29:00.238 --> 29:02.372
You okay?

29:03.508 --> 29:05.375
Yeah, I just...

29:05.377 --> 29:06.844
I can't believe he's gone.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.912
I know.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.518
I'm so sorry, lu.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.122
For not believing you.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.757
For everything.

29:19.759 --> 29:20.924
Thank you.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.293
I appreciate that.

29:25.029 --> 29:28.532
And listen, I know this is
the worst time in the world,

29:28.534 --> 29:30.834
And trust me, I don't want
to be thinking about this.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.836
What?
Business.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.205
I don't want anything
to do with it.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.007
I know, I know,

29:37.009 --> 29:38.842
But now that dad is gone,

29:38.844 --> 29:41.812
We each own a third
of the marbella.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.381
And petra,
she owns the other third.

29:44.383 --> 29:48.218
So, if you assign
your shares to me,

29:48.220 --> 29:50.454
I can overpower her.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.022
Is that why
you apologized to me?

29:52.024 --> 29:53.857
Because you want my shares?

29:53.859 --> 29:55.225
No, I was just...

29:55.227 --> 29:57.227
Petra's calling a board meeting
in an hour.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.096
I have to think practically,
that's it.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.932
No, you have to think
about the fact that you and dad

30:01.934 --> 30:05.402
Locked me up
in a mental institution.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.837
I know.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.872
And when you were sick
with cancer,

30:08.874 --> 30:11.008
I was there for you.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.177
Look, things got messed up.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.978
Yeah, they did.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.880
Want to know why?

30:16.882 --> 30:19.483
Because of money.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.019
I meant what I said
when I got back from the ashram.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.855
Money is the root of all
of our problems,

30:24.857 --> 30:26.857
And I want out.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.892
So, yeah.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.160
You can have my shares.

30:31.863 --> 30:34.498
And if you don't mind,
I-I want to be alone now.

30:36.868 --> 30:39.036
Thanks for coming today.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.871
It really meant a lot.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.539
Of course.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.175
In such sad days,
it helps people

30:45.177 --> 30:47.077
To see a celebrity.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.612
And like you said,

30:48.614 --> 30:50.581
We are a part
of each other's lives now.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.950
No matter what happens.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.452
So does that mean you made
a decision about mexico?

30:55.454 --> 30:56.954
No.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.222
Not yet,

30:58.224 --> 30:59.923
But your mother thinks
I should go.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.259
Come on.
That's what she said.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.027
That I should do
what makes me happy.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.931
Would it have made a difference
if she said something else?

31:07.933 --> 31:10.000
Perhaps.

31:13.238 --> 31:15.239
Jane:
<i>Okay, you two,</i>

31:15.241 --> 31:16.640
We were just at a funeral,
and if that doesn't say

31:16.642 --> 31:18.408
That life is too short,
I don't know what does.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.010
So you two are gonna tell
each other

31:20.012 --> 31:22.112
How you feel honestly
right now.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.380
Go.

31:24.515 --> 31:26.450
Okay, mom, you go first.

31:26.452 --> 31:27.651
Rogelio is...

31:27.653 --> 31:29.486
Dad?

31:29.488 --> 31:31.321
Right.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.591
Dad is considering going
to mexico.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.627
How does that make you feel?

31:36.629 --> 31:38.896
You know.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.130
No, we don't.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.265
Tell us.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.300
I guess...

31:43.302 --> 31:46.103
I'd be... Bummed.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.170
"bummed."

31:47.172 --> 31:49.439
Okay, good.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.174
We can work with "bummed."

31:51.176 --> 31:52.976
Why?

31:52.978 --> 31:54.278
His turn.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.046
Okay.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.015
Mom said she would feel bummed.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.684
How would you feel
if you were far away from her?

32:00.686 --> 32:03.186
I would feel

32:03.188 --> 32:05.589
Like... Santos felt

32:05.591 --> 32:07.224
When he was separated

32:07.226 --> 32:08.392
From blanca.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.994
Okay, now real world version.

32:10.996 --> 32:12.930
I'd be devastated.
Why?

32:12.932 --> 32:14.564
Because I have very strong
feelings for your mother.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.633
And I would like to
see where things go.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.002
Really?

32:19.004 --> 32:20.270
Of course.
Go on, mom.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.238
Tell him how you feel.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.539
I have really strong feelings

32:22.541 --> 32:23.941
For you, too,
and I don't want you to leave.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.409
Then I won't go. I will stay

32:25.411 --> 32:26.944
And work on esteban's show.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.012
But you hate him.

32:29.014 --> 32:30.547
And what if you hate it?
A-and if you do it for me

32:30.549 --> 32:32.082
And-and you don't like it,
I don't know,

32:32.084 --> 32:33.183
You might blame me.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.551
Never. And I will shine

32:34.553 --> 32:36.987
On esteban's show
the way I always shine!

32:36.989 --> 32:39.456
Even brighter because
you will be by my side.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.997
Man:
There has been an awakening.

32:46.999 --> 32:50.167
Have you felt it?

32:58.009 --> 32:59.643
Bueno.

33:05.183 --> 33:07.050
Seriously, was it that difficult

33:07.052 --> 33:09.252
For them to tell each
other how they feel?

33:22.166 --> 33:24.601
Yeah.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.304
I don't think rafael
feels safe with me.

33:27.306 --> 33:32.109
We got into a fight earlier
and I didn't trust him.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.443
Which... Hurt.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.512
And I get that.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.047
Bueno...

33:44.689 --> 33:46.523
Hmm?
Yeah.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.492
Exactly.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.627
So, how do I fix it?

33:50.629 --> 33:52.596
Thank you all
so much for meeting.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.364
Look, I know it's short notice,
but I thought

33:54.366 --> 33:56.333
It would be a good time
to talk about our game plan

33:56.335 --> 33:58.235
Moving forward.
That's great.

33:58.237 --> 34:01.538
Luisa's here to formally
assign her shares over to me.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.373
Which means
I am still in charge.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.775
Actually, rafael,

34:04.777 --> 34:07.110
I've changed my mind
about the shares.

34:08.613 --> 34:10.614
Uh...

34:10.616 --> 34:12.282
I thought you didn't
want to have

34:12.284 --> 34:14.284
Anything to do with this hotel.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.421
I don't. I'm assigning
my shares to petra.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.423
What? Are you crazy?!

34:19.425 --> 34:21.625
No, actually, I'm not crazy.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.293
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, I should</i>
<i>probably explain.</i>

34:23.295 --> 34:25.429
<i>Remember when this happened?</i>

34:25.431 --> 34:28.131
I meant what I said when I got
back from the ashram.

34:28.133 --> 34:30.133
Money is the root of all
of our problems.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.436
And I want out.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.304
So, yeah.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.373
You can have my shares.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.490
Luisa?

34:55.293 --> 34:57.461
I... I saw you here.

34:57.463 --> 35:00.330
And I-I...

35:00.332 --> 35:03.233
Well, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.402
Your father was
always good to me.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.503
Thank you.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.638
I appreciate that.

35:10.508 --> 35:13.376
I want to apologize to you.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.178
We never got along.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.546
And that's my fault.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.648
But a day like today...

35:18.650 --> 35:21.351
It makes you reflect.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.520
That's what my
shaman says, anyway.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.322
You have a shaman?

35:26.524 --> 35:28.358
Yes. Uh...

35:28.360 --> 35:31.361
I went to an ashram
a few weeks ago.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.396
I know, I know,
I know it sounds silly.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.398
No. It doesn't.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.667
Really?

35:37.669 --> 35:40.403
I wish rafael would
consider an ashram.

35:40.405 --> 35:43.406
He's so...

35:43.408 --> 35:46.510
Misguided, you know?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.245
Luisa:
<i>Money</i>

35:48.247 --> 35:49.746
Is destroying your life.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.681
You're not relating to
people as people anymore.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.783
We're all just financial
liabilities to you.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.385
Luisa, look.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.920
I get that you are mad, okay?

35:56.922 --> 36:00.223
But, please, do not give
petra your shares.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.725
I'm not giving them to her.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.461
I'm assigning her
my voting rights

36:04.463 --> 36:06.863
While I go
to my ashram to think.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.466
That is crazy.

36:09.468 --> 36:12.169
There you go
with that word again.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.503
Uh...
Look...

36:13.505 --> 36:14.671
Uh, I'm gonna go.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.773
I'm gonna take off.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.442
Take care of yourself.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.945
Petra:
Well, I guess that's settled.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.513
(door closes)

36:23.515 --> 36:24.514
So, let's talk
about some changes.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.316
Shall we?

36:26.318 --> 36:27.784
From now on...

36:27.786 --> 36:30.287
I'm the face of the marbella.

36:35.493 --> 36:37.561
Latin lover narrator:
<i>To say that petra was</i>
<i>on top of the world right now,</i>

36:37.563 --> 36:39.496
<i>Well, that would be</i>
<i>a gross understatement.</i>

36:39.498 --> 36:40.797
Hi. How are you?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.199
<i>Petra had just made the world</i>

36:42.201 --> 36:44.501
<i>Her bitch.</i>

36:44.503 --> 36:46.570
Man:
Uh, what floor?

36:46.572 --> 36:48.538
<i>And then</i>

36:48.540 --> 36:49.906
<i>She saw her dead ex-lover.</i>

36:49.908 --> 36:51.541
Roman?

36:51.543 --> 36:52.842
No.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.879
I-I'm his brother aaron.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.547
Yes.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.515
Oh.
(laughs)

36:58.517 --> 36:59.916
Yes, of course you are.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.551
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.988
You just... You look
so much like him.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.289
What is your name?

37:06.291 --> 37:07.724
Oh, uh, petra.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.360
Petra.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.595
Solano?

37:11.597 --> 37:13.930
It is so nice to
finally meet you.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.633
My brother's told me
so much about you.

37:16.635 --> 37:17.901
(elevator bell dings)

37:17.903 --> 37:20.670
I look forward to
getting to know you.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.642
I talked to my agent.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.377
I told her that
I'm staying here,

37:27.379 --> 37:29.346
Working on esteban's show.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.780
What did she say?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.449
That I'm stupid.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.583
But, hey, you pay agents

37:33.585 --> 37:34.584
To give their opinion,

37:34.586 --> 37:35.819
Then you threaten to fire them,

37:35.821 --> 37:37.020
Then you hang up on them,

37:37.022 --> 37:39.623
And then you do
whatever you want.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.259
You are what I want.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.862
Well, you know what I want?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.564
(whispering indistinctly)

37:49.634 --> 37:52.002
But what about your
vow of chastity?

37:52.004 --> 37:54.371
You said you wanted
to wait to have sex.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.373
Yeah, but that was
until there was a commitment.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.775
And you just decided
to stay in town for me.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.511
That's a pretty good commitment
from where I'm standing.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.947
It is not the same as marriage.
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Why are you arguing, man?</i>

38:03.949 --> 38:06.750
Why am I arguing?

38:09.587 --> 38:12.022
(music starts playing)

38:14.925 --> 38:17.661
Michael?

38:17.663 --> 38:19.929
You got to see this.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.773
Where's luisa?

38:29.775 --> 38:30.874
How am I supposed to know?

38:30.876 --> 38:32.776
She took off after the meeting.

38:32.778 --> 38:33.810
Why?

38:33.812 --> 38:36.680
Okay.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.748
After rose sent luisa a letter,

38:38.750 --> 38:41.818
We started monitoring
your sister's phone

38:41.820 --> 38:43.820
Just in case she tried
to reach out to her.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.889
Well, last night, she did.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.957
Rose asked luisa
to run away with her.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.693
Your sister said no.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.528
About an hour ago, she sent

38:51.530 --> 38:52.662
A text to an encoded number.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.597
(phone ringing)

38:54.599 --> 38:55.932
Yes?

38:55.934 --> 38:59.336
Yup. She's gone.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.988
I got takeout chinese.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.424
I don't know what you like
to eat when you're upset.

39:21.426 --> 39:24.661
But egg rolls are my go-to.

39:24.663 --> 39:28.465
Egg rolls sound great.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.767
Good.

39:33.604 --> 39:35.705
And, look,
you don't have to tell me

39:35.707 --> 39:37.407
The way you're
feeling right now.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.876
I-I just want you
to know that you can.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.946
That you can trust me
with whatever

39:42.948 --> 39:46.683
You're feeling or thinking.

39:46.685 --> 39:50.787
Because I love you.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.691
I do.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.727
I love you.

40:01.632 --> 40:04.634
I love you. I love you.

40:04.636 --> 40:07.404
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And in that moment, it felt</i>
<i>like a telenovela again.</i>

40:07.406 --> 40:11.040
<i>But for all the best reasons.</i>

40:15.780 --> 40:18.782
And I am so, so sorry

40:18.784 --> 40:20.784
That your father is gone.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.887
I can't imagine what
you're going through right now.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.991
It's, uh...

40:27.993 --> 40:31.594
Just hard.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.596
'cause I was
a huge disappointment.

40:33.598 --> 40:34.697
No...

40:34.699 --> 40:37.534
No, I was 'cause he told me.

40:38.803 --> 40:41.738
And I'm fighting
so hard to change that.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.557
Mm.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.695
Good morning.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.697
Good morning.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.633
Have you been up long?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.802
Mm, little bit.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.705
Oh, I filled this out.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.874
It's our baby shower
questionnaire.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.743
So we can ace that test.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.745
Aw, that's sweet.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.948
"livin' on a prayer"?

41:24.950 --> 41:26.816
Really? You don't want
to rethink that one?

41:26.818 --> 41:28.751
That's a great song.

41:28.753 --> 41:31.120
But I do want
to rethink something else.

41:31.122 --> 41:32.722
<i>Caddyshack?</i>

41:33.824 --> 41:36.726
(laughs)

41:36.728 --> 41:38.795
Filling this out

41:38.797 --> 41:42.832
Made me think about
our whole registry thing.

41:42.834 --> 41:46.569
Jane, what are we doing, huh?

41:46.571 --> 41:48.872
I love you.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.573
You love me.

41:50.575 --> 41:52.041
We're having a baby.

41:52.043 --> 41:55.578
This is true.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.947
So let's move in together.
