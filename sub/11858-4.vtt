WEBVTT

00:08.166 --> 00:09.125
Arf, arf!

00:26.834 --> 00:30.542
Get behind my counter
and sell some makeup, honey.

00:30.625 --> 00:33.709
At ease, soldier.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.583
- How'd it go in there, son?
- Great.

00:38.667 --> 00:39.917
We made
our own record.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.583
When she's ready,
pop her on the
jukebox.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.000
I know your mom will
want
to hear it.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.417
I will do, dad.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.667
Baby, why are you
so secretive about your
songs?

00:55.750 --> 00:58.000
'Cause what if
you don't like 'em?

00:58.083 --> 00:59.834
Impossible.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.583
You all done there,
sugar?

01:03.667 --> 01:05.750
Looks like I am,
lemon drop.

01:09.208 --> 01:11.208
You're such
a spaz!

01:11.291 --> 01:13.917
Alright, Luke.
Cut it out.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.083
Face it, JP,
your cousin's a
fream.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.458
So is his outcast
fream girlfriend.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.208
Stick it up your wazoo,
Frankenstein.

01:21.291 --> 01:24.750
Wow, classy lady, Bingo.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.125
They can drop dead twice, Bingo

01:27.208 --> 01:30.458
'cause you're my
star,
and all we need is
love.

01:30.542 --> 01:32.250
- And music.
- Mm-hm.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.625
Never got a chance to ask.

02:14.709 --> 02:17.542
How did round two go with IAD?

02:17.625 --> 02:19.208
I don't know.

02:19.291 --> 02:20.333
Bad.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.542
So what happened?

02:22.625 --> 02:26.542
Someone snitched
about Burrell.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.041
You're kidding
me.
Who?

02:28.125 --> 02:30.291
Could have been anyone who knew.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.834
[scoffs]
Oh, Scotty, come on.

02:31.917 --> 02:34.083
You don't think
it was one of us?

02:34.166 --> 02:35.709
Pick a stick.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.583
- What's it today?
- Crackpot in the witness
room.

02:39.667 --> 02:42.208
'Says he saw a murder
54 years ago.'

02:42.291 --> 02:45.291
- Drawing straws.
- How about we just do our
job?

02:48.792 --> 02:50.291
What's with him?

02:52.709 --> 02:54.417
You saying
you witnessed a murder?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.917
Kinda.
I mean,
sorta.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.333
Which is it, Lloyd?

02:58.417 --> 03:00.333
I saw blood..

03:00.417 --> 03:03.834
...lots of it,
back in 1953.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.250
Well, blood isn't a murder.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.375
I know what I saw.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.875
You gonna write
this down or
what?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.333
Go on.

03:13.417 --> 03:17.834
Late one night, my parents
are
throwing pans at each other.

03:17.917 --> 03:21.417
I snuck out
to practice pop flies.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.792
My ball gets away from me

03:23.875 --> 03:26.000
so I chase it down the alley

03:26.083 --> 03:29.917
behind
Valentine's Five And Dime.

03:51.458 --> 03:55.500
The wallet belonged
to Bingo Zohar.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.875
I heard my parents talkin'
few days later

03:57.959 --> 04:02.500
about him being shot
behind some...blues club

04:02.583 --> 04:04.250
in Point Breeze.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.959
And where was this five and
dime
you found the wallet at?

04:07.041 --> 04:08.667
Germantown.
My old neighborhood.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.250
That's clear across Philly
from Point Breeze.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.667
It was all white in '53.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.333
That's...what I'm sayin'.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.542
You never told your parents
what you saw?

04:19.625 --> 04:22.000
Shouldn't have been out,
you know?

04:22.083 --> 04:26.709
Then...just got easier
not to believe my eyes.

04:26.792 --> 04:30.000
Pretend it was a...dream
or somethin'.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.834
Well, it sounds like this
memory
ain't exactly crystal.

04:32.917 --> 04:36.333
Yeah, well, maybe, uh

04:36.417 --> 04:38.542
this will help.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.709
Hung onto it.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.083
Fifty four years.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.959
(Scotty)
'Why come forward now?'

04:44.041 --> 04:45.542
My eyes.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.834
I'm losing 'em.

04:47.917 --> 04:51.041
Doc says a few more
years,
I'll be blind.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.875
Guess I thought
I'd tell what I saw
might..

04:54.959 --> 04:56.709
...set things right.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
We can't fix your eyes..

05:01.083 --> 05:05.250
...but...we'll try
to set things right.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.834
(Rush)
'Bingo Zohar, 19 years old.'

05:39.917 --> 05:42.583
(Valens)
Shot and killed behind
Red Hot Mama's Blues Club.

05:42.667 --> 05:43.917
Corner of 20th and South.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.750
Rounded up the usual
suspects,
all black.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.375
Never could
pin it on anyone.

05:48.458 --> 05:52.417
Cops never found the bullet
that cleared Bingo's chest.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.875
Makes sense
if it's only the dump site.

05:54.959 --> 05:58.583
Strange substance
on Bingo's sleeve.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.333
Cops back then
couldn't ID it.

06:00.417 --> 06:03.250
Now if he was murdered
in the five and dime..

06:03.333 --> 06:05.208
Changes the suspect list.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.583
'He'd recently moved
from Brandywine, old farm
town.'

06:08.667 --> 06:10.417
Parents died in a car accident.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.583
(Valens)
'He was living
with the Valentine family.'

06:12.667 --> 06:15.917
Uncle Ed,
Aunt Julianna..

06:16.041 --> 06:18.625
...cousin JP.

06:18.709 --> 06:20.500
- Who's the girl?
- 'Girlfriend.'

06:20.583 --> 06:22.458
Uh...Miranda Allison.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.875
'Recording booth
behind the family.'

06:24.959 --> 06:26.792
Typical of the old
five and dimes.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.417
And doer dumping the body
on the other side of town

06:29.500 --> 06:31.125
gets the spotlight off himself.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.458
Maybe he did it
on the way home.

06:34.709 --> 06:37.083
(Rush)
'Arthur Brown AKA Aces.'

06:37.166 --> 06:40.625
Worked the night shift
with Bingo at the five and
dime.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.125
And lived at 22nd and South.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.792
Two blocks from the dump site.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.834
If we're lucky, evidence
still has Bingo's shirt.

06:45.917 --> 06:48.542
Send it to the lab, maybe
they can ID that substance.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.917
Meanwhile,
have a talk with Aces?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.750
Let's have a look around
the old five and dime.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.458
See if we can't find
that bullet.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.417
- You're kidding, right?
- Afraid not.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.583
It's been 27 years
since this holistic store

07:02.667 --> 07:04.709
was Valentine's Five And Dime.

07:04.792 --> 07:05.792
That so?

07:05.875 --> 07:07.667
Kinda out of the realm
of possibility

07:07.750 --> 07:11.333
that you'll find
some 50-year-old bullet.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.625
Could have got lodged
in a wall or a
floorboard.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.792
So what?

07:16.875 --> 07:21.166
You think you're digging up
my floors or walls?

07:21.250 --> 07:24.834
It's not out of the
realm
of possibility.

07:24.917 --> 07:28.166
These are fresh walls.
I just had 'em painted.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.166
And my floors
are Malaysian bamboo.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.000
So maybe you should look
somewhere else

07:34.083 --> 07:35.875
for your phantom bullet.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.000
Did you find anything
during that remodel?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.083
Like a bullet?

07:39.166 --> 07:40.792
Uh...no.

07:40.875 --> 07:44.250
'Cause if I find out
you tampered with
evidence

07:44.333 --> 07:45.625
I'll stick you
in the slammer with
guys

07:45.709 --> 07:47.542
who ain't familiar
with Buddhist
teachings.

07:47.625 --> 07:51.542
You do, and karma will be
all over your ass, pal.

07:51.625 --> 07:54.208
Oh, I'll be all
over your ass,
pal..

07:54.291 --> 07:55.417
...with a warrant.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.959
Goji berry?
They make you happy.

07:58.041 --> 08:00.959
You eat enough,
you never stop smiling.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.125
Yeah, this place looks great.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.792
Just like the stories
I used to hear growin' up.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.750
Yeah, people tend to
embellish the past.

08:15.834 --> 08:18.875
Red Hot Mama's was a dive,
but a fun one.

08:18.959 --> 08:22.959
When I came into some money,
I decided to make reopening it

08:23.041 --> 08:25.125
'my pet project.'

08:25.208 --> 08:26.625
Well, there's
a blues resurgence.

08:26.709 --> 08:28.625
'Kids hearing it
for the first time.'

08:28.709 --> 08:30.500
Oh, you wouldn't believe
what these kids

08:30.583 --> 08:31.583
will pay for a drink.

08:31.667 --> 08:32.750
(Jeffries)
'Six dollars.'

08:32.834 --> 08:36.250
- Nine.
- Bingo Zohar?

08:36.333 --> 08:38.458
You know him or what?

08:39.875 --> 08:41.375
I remember Bingo.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.834
Cat was one of a kind.

08:44.917 --> 08:47.375
Shot down
back of this alley.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.083
See, we think he was killed
at Valentine's Five And Dime

08:50.166 --> 08:52.083
where you two worked
the night shift
together.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.250
I wasn't working
that night with Bingo

08:54.333 --> 08:56.000
if that's what
you're implyin'.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.291
I ain't
implyin' it.
I'm sayin' it.

08:58.375 --> 09:01.250
I quit Valentine's
the week before.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.291
Got tired of cleaning up
after white folk

09:04.375 --> 09:06.291
getting treated
like dirt.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.667
Bingo treat you that way, too?

09:07.750 --> 09:10.625
He treated me with respect.

09:10.709 --> 09:14.291
Kid was way ahead of his time
in more ways than one.

09:29.709 --> 09:32.291
Uh...I apologize, sir.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.542
I figured after
hours,
Mr. Valentine's

09:34.625 --> 09:37.125
no negro music rule
don't apply.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.625
Won't play it again.

09:38.709 --> 09:41.709
This is Wynonie Harris, right?

09:41.792 --> 09:44.041
- You know Wynonie Harris?
- Yeah.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.375
I saw him play
in a chicken shack

09:45.458 --> 09:47.625
back on Brandywine Creek
where I'm from.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.333
Heard about your folks.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.667
Sorry.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.166
I used to sing
this song for my mama.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.917
The only thing
that'd make her smile.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.166
My daddy
was a drunk, see.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.834
Confused her
for his punching bag.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.333
I think it made her feel
a little better

10:05.417 --> 10:08.709
hearing other people
carrying it around, their
pain.

10:08.792 --> 10:12.041
Let your mama know
she wasn't alone.

10:12.125 --> 10:15.500
Yeah.
I think I know how she felt
now.

10:15.583 --> 10:19.417
So you're telling me your uncle
lets you listen to this music?

10:19.500 --> 10:20.792
[chuckles
]
Come on.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.875
The night he found my stash
of Louis Jordan records

10:22.959 --> 10:24.166
smashed every one.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.333
Said he wouldn't have

10:25.417 --> 10:27.083
this corrupting
devil music in his house.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.417
Mm-hmm, now that sound
like old man Valentine.

10:31.250 --> 10:34.542
Hey, you ever see when Wynonie
shakes his leg like this?

10:34.625 --> 10:37.208
Yeah...yeah,
yeah, yeah.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.458
And then..

10:38.542 --> 10:40.709
...he does that spin.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.125
- Bah!
- Hey.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.166
Ha.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.792
Hey, you got some pipes.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.041
Yeah, it's my thing...singin'.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.250
Hmm.

11:01.333 --> 11:04.542
Yeah, just not in front
of other people usually.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.500
Hey, you ever try this one?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.917
Got to be good friends,
the two of us.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.917
Listening to that music
late at night.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.542
Kid was real decent.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.417
(Jeffries)
'But Mr. Valentine
had a problem'

11:27.500 --> 11:30.125
with Bingo listening
that

11:30.208 --> 11:34.250
Old man feared it was
the beginning of the end.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.542
First black music..

11:36.625 --> 11:39.083
...then blacks sitting
at his lunch counter.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.583
Saying he would have
hurt
Bingo over it?

11:41.667 --> 11:44.792
What Mr. Valentine said was law

11:44.875 --> 11:47.917
and he had the temper
to back it up, too.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.083
But Bingo couldn't hide his
love
of rock 'n' roll from no one.

11:59.417 --> 12:01.917
(Miller)
'Understand your husband,
Ed Valentine'

12:02.000 --> 12:03.542
passed away
a few years ago.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.792
It'll be 12 years
this Christmas.

12:05.875 --> 12:06.834
God rest his soul.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.250
He was a good man?

12:08.333 --> 12:10.125
Oh, yes.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.875
Ed was an officer
in World War II.

12:12.959 --> 12:15.125
We were happily married,
60 years.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.500
Where was your husband
the night Bingo was
killed?

12:18.709 --> 12:20.125
Asleep in his bed.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.375
Right next to mine, of course.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.458
Well, Bingo was
like a son to us.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.583
We understand
your husband didn't
approve

12:28.667 --> 12:31.667
of the rock 'n' roll
music
Bingo listened to.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.750
No, he certainly did not.

12:33.834 --> 12:34.875
Sounds like neither did you.

12:34.959 --> 12:37.333
Well, the stuff was distasteful.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.959
Ed said all negro music was.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.709
N-no offense, dear.

12:44.583 --> 12:45.500
None taken.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.709
We were a generation

12:46.792 --> 12:50.333
that made it
through the Depression, the
war.

12:50.417 --> 12:53.125
We wanted stability,
common decency.

12:53.208 --> 12:55.875
And negro music wasn't that.

12:55.959 --> 12:58.875
Well, Ed said it made
the kids go wild.

13:00.458 --> 13:03.375
And, believe you me, it did.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.208
You're gonna be
radioactive out
there.

13:07.291 --> 13:11.000
Yes, I wanna sing
somethin' real, with teeth

13:11.083 --> 13:13.542
not the usual fake-O,
happy land stuff.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.875
Doesn't matter
what your song is,
baby.

13:18.959 --> 13:21.208
Just matters
that you're
singin' it.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.291
Everyone'll
see
what I see.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.166
That I'm a fream.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.208
That you're
the razz's
berries.

13:39.959 --> 13:42.917
JP And The Wishing Stars.

13:44.417 --> 13:46.500
I know someone's mother
is proud.

13:49.417 --> 13:53.500
Now please welcome to the stage
Bingo Zohar performing

13:53.583 --> 13:56.375
'"Jeannie
With The Light Brown Hair."'

14:12.000 --> 14:13.834
Boo! Hiss!

14:13.917 --> 14:16.000
Wake me when
the snooze fest is
over.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.625
Miranda, stop him.

15:24.709 --> 15:27.458
Stop your boyfriend
from doing..

15:27.542 --> 15:29.750
'...whatever it is he's doing.'

15:30.917 --> 15:32.959
He's not mine anymore.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.834
Just look at him.

15:38.917 --> 15:41.000
Bingo drove the girls wild

15:41.083 --> 15:43.959
with those swiveling hips
of his.

15:44.041 --> 15:45.000
'Disgraceful.'

15:45.083 --> 15:47.834
Kind of like Elvis. Hot.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.583
So Miranda was pushed aside?

15:54.667 --> 15:57.166
Something you want to share,
Mrs. Valentine?

16:00.041 --> 16:03.166
Well, shortly
after Bingo's death

16:03.250 --> 16:04.458
Miranda's mother caught her

16:04.542 --> 16:09.041
playing Russian roulette
with a loaded handgun.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.125
Sent her to the state
mental ward, poor thing.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.959
Hmm. Sounds like the
poor thing was off her rocker.

16:25.458 --> 16:28.875
(Jeffries)
'Early '50s, white kid
singin' black music'

16:28.959 --> 16:30.417
'it reminds me of Elvis.'

16:30.500 --> 16:31.875
(Stillman)
Yeah, I hate to admit it.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.375
I broke up
with my junior high sweetheart

16:34.458 --> 16:37.208
because she joined
the Elvis Fan Club.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.125
- No.
- Trini Rene.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.500
(Stillman)
Back in the late '50s

16:40.583 --> 16:42.375
the girls were
either Elvis
girls..

16:42.458 --> 16:44.583
(Will)
Or Pat Boone girls,
I remember.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.500
I told Trini my family
wouldn't approve

16:46.583 --> 16:48.875
of me goin' out
with an Elvis
girl.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.917
I guess I
was
a square.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.375
No, man,
you were a cube.

16:54.458 --> 16:55.875
My family hated
Elvis too

16:55.959 --> 16:58.834
especially the ones who thought
he ripped off black music.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.125
He certainly was
a polarizing
figure.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.083
Yeah, have to be
to make history.

17:03.166 --> 17:05.375
I got the results back
on the shirt.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.834
From Bingo's sleeve?

17:06.917 --> 17:09.250
Can't believe Evidence still
had it after all these years.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.792
Yeah, pretty dependable guys
in that unit.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.417
'Nitrocellulose.'

17:14.500 --> 17:17.375
Used primarily
as a car finish back in the
day.

17:17.458 --> 17:20.041
It could be from the car
that dumped Bingo.

17:20.125 --> 17:23.125
Makin' it a long
shot.
Lot of cars used
it.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.625
It's back to square one.

17:24.709 --> 17:26.875
You have a conversation
with the jealous girlfriend?

17:26.959 --> 17:28.750
- I'm on it.
- Have Vera go with you.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.750
No, I got it covered.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.917
What the hell is his problem?

17:41.709 --> 17:45.583
(Valens)
'Where were you the night your
boyfriend was shot, Miranda?'

17:45.667 --> 17:47.625
Bingo and I went
to the drive-in.

17:47.709 --> 17:51.166
We saw "The Band Wagon "
with Fred Astaire.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.667
Uh, he dropped me
off early.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.458
- How early?
- About...10 p.m.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.291
That was the last time
I saw him.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.959
The next morning,
I received the phone call.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.291
He was dead.

18:02.375 --> 18:05.500
I understand you were locked up
in the nuthouse.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.333
Suicide attempt.

18:07.417 --> 18:10.000
Eighteen and your boyfriend
is murdered?

18:10.083 --> 18:13.500
I would say that
that warrants depression.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.667
Where'd the gun come from?

18:15.750 --> 18:18.959
My mother kept a gun
in her bedside table

18:19.041 --> 18:20.291
next to her pills.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.709
And I bet,
you're gonna tell
me

18:22.792 --> 18:25.333
you don't have it anymore.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.125
I didn't kill Bingo.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.208
He was my first love

18:29.291 --> 18:32.625
the purest of all my romances.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.458
'Well, till you saw him
on stage'

18:34.542 --> 18:36.250
turnin'
the other girls on

18:36.333 --> 18:37.709
and you got pushed
to the back row.

18:37.792 --> 18:40.333
It wasn't the girls
Bingo loved.

18:40.417 --> 18:42.667
- It was the music.
- Yeah, right.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.750
Bingo never betrayed me.

18:44.834 --> 18:46.250
He shared his limelight.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.792
Bingo, play that song
you showed me for my girl.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.625
She let me polish
her headlights.

19:00.166 --> 19:02.542
Easy on the word painting, Luke.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.208
Got a lady present.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.333
Hey, how do you get your
hair
like that, Bingo?

19:09.417 --> 19:11.834
Miranda's the one
with style.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.291
- Ask her.
- Need to grow it out.

19:14.375 --> 19:17.333
But it ain't gonna hide
that Frankenstein head of
yours.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.709
Ha ha.

19:18.792 --> 19:21.041
How about you, JP?
Gonna grow your hair out, too?

19:21.125 --> 19:23.542
No. No.
High and tight is right for
me.

19:23.625 --> 19:24.875
You sound like your dad.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.250
Yeah, well, imagine
what my dad would say

19:26.333 --> 19:29.000
if I came home
looking like you.

19:29.083 --> 19:32.750
Who cares what he'd say?
Don't be a square, JP.

19:32.834 --> 19:36.125
Bingo, someone saw
that "Bandstand" scout

19:36.208 --> 19:37.458
at your last show.

19:37.542 --> 19:40.250
We hear those rumors
after our shows, too.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.208
Nothing ever comes of it.

19:42.291 --> 19:44.959
(Luke)
'Maybe we should add some rock
'n' roll beats to our line-up
.'

19:45.041 --> 19:47.625
Maybe dance like Bingo instead
of all this sidestepping stuff.

19:47.709 --> 19:49.750
JP And The Wishing Stars
will not be gyrating

19:49.834 --> 19:52.500
their privates on stage
like a bunch of natives.

19:52.583 --> 19:55.000
It might serve you to
practice
gyrating your privates.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.542
Uh, JP, Come on!

20:00.625 --> 20:03.333
It was just a joke.
Hey, come back!

20:05.041 --> 20:07.125
(Miranda)
'The music was changing.'

20:07.208 --> 20:08.458
So were the times.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.417
And, uh, Mr.
King
of the quartet

20:11.500 --> 20:13.583
was left in the dust.

20:23.959 --> 20:27.375
And you should hear the music
my granddaughter listens to.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.959
Uh, milkshake this
and booty that.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.333
She made me a playlist..

20:33.417 --> 20:35.000
...and I learned
to appreciate it.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.041
Like you learned
to appreciate Bingo's music?

20:37.125 --> 20:38.959
(JP)
'It took me a while,
I guess I was..'

20:39.041 --> 20:40.291
...a stick in the mud back then.

20:40.375 --> 20:43.792
Where were you
the night Bingo was killed?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.125
At Wishing Star practice.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.000
Like clockwork Saturday nights.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.041
You and The Wishing Stars
ever incorporate

20:50.125 --> 20:51.291
Bingo's style
into your act?

20:51.375 --> 20:52.709
We did.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.000
As a matter of fact,
we picked up some of his moves

20:55.083 --> 20:58.542
and played
one of his songs too.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.959
Yeah? Which one?

21:00.041 --> 21:02.208
I can't remember the name,
but the chorus

21:02.291 --> 21:04.000
was something like, uh

21:10.458 --> 21:11.625
That sounds meaningful.

21:11.709 --> 21:13.583
- I liked that one.
- Not too racy?

21:13.667 --> 21:15.583
Well, it wasn't always
the lyrics that were racy.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.041
It was the, the beat
that unnerved people.

21:18.125 --> 21:19.583
The beat?

21:19.667 --> 21:21.083
Things were
different back then.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.291
Neighborhoods were segregated,
even the music.

21:23.375 --> 21:28.500
And the beat was considered
an African-American...thing.

21:28.583 --> 21:33.166
So Bingo bringing that sort
thing

21:33.250 --> 21:34.250
had repercussions.

21:34.333 --> 21:35.792
Oh, sure.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.333
And some people took the heat
more than others.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.208
Dad, can we watch "Bandstand"?

21:43.291 --> 21:46.041
No one wants
to watch kids dance.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.709
That show is gonna
get yanked.

21:48.792 --> 21:50.709
We're gonna watch
Milton Berle like we always
do.

21:50.792 --> 21:53.750
Uncle Ed, you haven't received
a telegram for me, have you?

21:53.834 --> 21:56.041
Hoping to hear
from "Bandstand", actually.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.083
They don't play
your kind of
music.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.875
Nothing for
you,
Bingo.

22:01.959 --> 22:04.083
But JP here was accepted
at Princeton.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.375
Go show him the letter, son.

22:07.542 --> 22:08.792
Didn't go
to college
myself.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.583
JP, first one
in the family.

22:10.667 --> 22:12.542
(Julianna)
'I noticed that you
and Bingo are pinned.'

22:12.625 --> 22:16.083
(Miranda)
Oh, it's just for fun.
Ironic, actually.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.291
Ironic?

22:17.375 --> 22:20.125
Oh, well,
it's our anti-commitment

22:20.208 --> 22:23.667
to never plan for the future
for the rest of our lives.

22:25.291 --> 22:28.250
If you don't plan for a
future,
what will you live on?

22:28.333 --> 22:30.750
Love and music.

22:30.834 --> 22:34.458
Miranda, I'm sure your
mother
has explained this to you

22:34.542 --> 22:39.250
but your husband's
livelihood
will be your livelihood.

22:39.333 --> 22:41.667
I guess I thought I'd get
my own job or something.

22:41.750 --> 22:44.667
Oh. As a teacher or a nurse?

22:46.834 --> 22:51.417
Miranda dear, I suggest you
secure a future for yourself

22:51.500 --> 22:54.208
before the bloom
is off the rose.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.709
You don't want to end
up
a penniless old maid

22:57.792 --> 22:59.417
now, do you?

23:01.875 --> 23:04.041
Since JP is
going
away to college

23:04.125 --> 23:07.417
I'll need someone
to take over the store
someday

23:07.500 --> 23:11.583
so I am promoting you
to counter manager,
Bingo.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.792
(Bingo)
'Uh, thank you, sir.'

23:14.875 --> 23:16.125
'But I..'

23:16.208 --> 23:18.208
I was really hoping
to focus on my music.

23:18.291 --> 23:21.333
Can we afford to give
promotions right now, Ed?

23:21.417 --> 23:24.709
Mother, don't you worry your
pretty little head about
money.

23:24.792 --> 23:27.375
I fired Aces anyhow.

23:27.458 --> 23:30.458
Aces?
But he's your best worker.

23:30.542 --> 23:32.125
That job is the only thing

23:32.208 --> 23:33.792
that's keeping his family
out of the poorhouse.

23:33.875 --> 23:36.291
Well, he should've thought
about that before he left

23:36.375 --> 23:37.917
that devil music on the jukebox.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.667
Oh, no, sir,
I left that record on.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.083
(Ed)
'No need to cover
for him, son.'

23:41.166 --> 23:44.041
Kid's a bad apple.
Now, he's gone.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.667
- 'So Aces didn't quit.'
- 'He was fired.'

23:48.750 --> 23:50.500
Bingo was determined
to find him.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.792
He wanted to make it up
to him somehow.

23:52.875 --> 23:54.917
And when was this?

23:56.125 --> 23:59.208
A few days before he was killed.

23:59.291 --> 24:02.458
(Jeffries)
Aces worked five solid years
for Mr. Valentine.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.208
Gets fired 'cause of Bingo.

24:04.291 --> 24:08.166
Maybe he catches up with him at
the five and dime, gets even?

24:08.250 --> 24:10.083
So why make the distinction
of quitting--

24:10.166 --> 24:11.500
(Valens)
'Wake up, Miller.'

24:11.583 --> 24:13.917
The guy's coverin' his motive.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.250
Unless he's covering
his motive.

24:15.333 --> 24:17.875
You want to let me finish?

24:17.959 --> 24:20.667
Scotty.
We need to talk.

24:28.291 --> 24:30.208
So go ahead.
Air it out now.

24:30.291 --> 24:31.917
'Cause if I got to watch you
stompin' around here

24:32.000 --> 24:34.291
like some bullheaded jackass
one more minute

24:34.375 --> 24:35.583
somebody's
gonna lose some teeth.

24:35.667 --> 24:37.000
Ain't gonna be
the only one,
brother.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.291
You really think one of us
ratted you out to IAD?

24:39.375 --> 24:41.250
You tell me.

24:41.333 --> 24:44.083
Who do you think
you're talking to, Scotty?

24:44.166 --> 24:45.583
You know us
better than that.

24:45.667 --> 24:47.417
Then who was it, hmm?

24:47.500 --> 24:49.542
Told that IAD
jerk
about Burrell?

24:49.625 --> 24:51.417
Get real, man.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.041
You think
we're the only ones who knew?

24:53.125 --> 24:56.166
'People talk, but you start
turning on the people
that's--'

24:56.250 --> 24:59.583
It ain't your job they're
coming
after now, is it, Will?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.125
They're out to get me, man.

25:03.208 --> 25:06.166
Using this Burrell thing as an
excuse to hang me on the shoot.

25:06.250 --> 25:09.000
IAD's on a fishing expedition.
That's what they do.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.250
Nah.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.291
This guy won't let it go.

25:12.375 --> 25:13.667
They want my badge.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.750
Boss will never
let that happen.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.875
And you got to know, none of us
would ever help them.

25:20.375 --> 25:23.458
I don't get it, Will.

25:23.542 --> 25:24.500
That was a good shoot.

25:24.583 --> 25:25.750
Well, you did
the right thing.

25:25.834 --> 25:28.083
Then why are they
comin' after me?

25:28.166 --> 25:29.291
I don't know.

25:29.375 --> 25:33.000
But you got to hang tough,
circle the wagons.

25:33.083 --> 25:35.583
And stop acting
like such a jackass.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.959
Alright, then, maybe
I should scream or something

25:43.041 --> 25:44.625
so they don't think
we're in here hugging.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.792
Yeah, make it sound good.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.458
Scotty, look!

25:48.542 --> 25:50.625
'No cop in their right mind'

25:50.709 --> 25:53.000
'plays along with IAD!'

25:53.083 --> 25:55.750
'They don't like us.
We don't like them!'

25:57.125 --> 25:58.959
- What's going on?
- Scotty and Will.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.750
Having a talk.

26:00.834 --> 26:02.041
About time.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.917
Found Aces'
Social Security records.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.041
Checks out.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.000
He was fired a week
before Bingo's murder.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.333
Picked up a part-time job

26:08.417 --> 26:10.375
finishing cars
at an auto repair.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.000
Using nitrocellulose.

26:12.083 --> 26:14.166
It's the same substance
found on Bingo's sleeve

26:14.250 --> 26:15.834
the night he was killed.

26:15.917 --> 26:19.125
Hm. Looks like Bingo
found Aces after all.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.375
(Jeffries)
You were with Bingo
the night he was murdered.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.500
Found nitrocellulose
on Bingo's sleeve.

26:27.583 --> 26:30.542
From your job
working on
cars.

26:30.625 --> 26:32.709
Turns out you didn't quit
the five and dime.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.417
You were fired.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.166
I lose everything
'cause some white kid

26:37.250 --> 26:40.000
forgets to take a record
off the juke

26:40.083 --> 26:44.500
while Mr. Valentine spends
his night pawing the makeup
girl

26:44.583 --> 26:47.333
behind his office door?

26:47.417 --> 26:49.625
World ain't just.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.166
So you got even.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.417
You could say that.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.166
I saw Bingo that night..

26:57.250 --> 26:59.500
...standing about
where you are now.

26:59.583 --> 27:02.667
- Why lie about it, Aces?
- Why do you think?

27:05.083 --> 27:07.417
Grew up black, didn't you?

27:10.250 --> 27:13.542
Maybe...it was different for you

27:13.625 --> 27:15.375
but for my generation

27:15.458 --> 27:19.083
the color lines weren't drawn
exactly fair.

27:20.542 --> 27:22.625
Talk about that night.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.500
Treated the kid bad.

27:26.583 --> 27:28.709
Stomped on his dream.

27:56.083 --> 27:59.417
You're a hard man to find.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.667
It ain't right
what my uncle
did.

28:05.750 --> 28:06.917
He's trying to give
me
a promotion.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.959
I told him
I wouldn't take
it.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.000
Man, you really
don't get it, do you?

28:12.083 --> 28:13.125
What?

28:13.208 --> 28:15.333
We do not live
in the same world.

28:16.625 --> 28:18.667
This is two towns.

28:18.750 --> 28:22.250
Rules ain't the same in both.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.625
You think it's hep
to dress like a colored man

28:24.709 --> 28:27.375
sing like a colored man?

28:27.458 --> 28:29.792
That make you cool?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.750
But you don't suffer
the consequences

28:31.834 --> 28:34.208
of a colored man.

28:34.291 --> 28:35.667
Do you?

28:35.750 --> 28:37.792
No. I don't.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.709
That ain't right.

28:42.542 --> 28:45.166
Hey, but this music..

28:45.250 --> 28:46.667
...it's the only
thing
that speaks to
me.

28:46.750 --> 28:47.959
You don't even know
what it means.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.417
You think
I don't know about
loss?

28:50.500 --> 28:53.375
About wanting the pain
to go away, but it
won't?

28:53.458 --> 28:55.834
About living when you think
you can't go on?

29:00.917 --> 29:02.834
I'd be lost
without my
music.

29:02.917 --> 29:05.208
Then sing it
like you mean it.

29:06.291 --> 29:08.333
Make it your own.

29:09.166 --> 29:11.125
How do I do that?

29:11.208 --> 29:14.291
Ain't you always, uh,
scribbling somethin' down?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.041
Your songs?

29:17.583 --> 29:19.083
I ain't ready
to share that
yet.

29:19.166 --> 29:21.250
Then get out of my face.

29:22.333 --> 29:23.834
(Miranda)
'Bingo.'

29:27.083 --> 29:29.208
Mrs. Valentine told me
you turned down the promotion.

29:29.291 --> 29:31.333
- How could you?
- What are you doing here?

29:31.417 --> 29:35.125
What about our
future?
You have to take it.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.375
You have to tell Mr.
Valentine
you will, right now.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.375
(Bingo)
'Keep it down.
What has gotten into you?'

29:39.458 --> 29:41.834
- Don't tell me to keep it
down!
- Let's talk out back.

29:49.291 --> 29:52.166
So Miranda came here
the night Bingo was murdered?

29:52.250 --> 29:53.834
Brought her out back to talk.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.125
Same place his body was dumped.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.875
"Bingo and I went
to the drive-in.

30:01.959 --> 30:03.959
"Saw "The Band Wagon"
with Fred Astaire.

30:04.041 --> 30:07.041
He dropped me off early."

30:07.125 --> 30:09.125
But you saw him
later that night.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.625
Behind Red Hot Mama's.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.625
- That wasn't me.
- You panicked.

30:12.709 --> 30:15.000
'Demanded Bingo take
that promotion.'

30:15.083 --> 30:17.583
- 'Secure his future.'
- And yours.

30:17.667 --> 30:23.208
So what happened to living
on love and music, Miranda?

30:23.291 --> 30:26.000
I lost faith in myself.

30:26.709 --> 30:27.875
In us.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.709
There were no opportunities
for me then

30:29.792 --> 30:32.709
and I was terrified
I'd be dependent

30:32.792 --> 30:36.834
on a broke musician
the rest of my life.

30:36.917 --> 30:38.583
Mrs. Valentine
got to you.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.750
The times got to me.

30:44.083 --> 30:46.333
I didn't want to end up
like my mother.

30:47.834 --> 30:49.250
Nobody does.

30:51.500 --> 30:55.959
And so...I told Bingo
he had to give up

30:56.041 --> 30:58.291
everything that he was.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.250
I'm sorry.

31:01.333 --> 31:03.625
I'm sorry, Bingo,
but Mrs. Valentine was
right.

31:04.834 --> 31:06.583
I can't be a nurse.

31:06.667 --> 31:08.208
Blood makes me queasy.

31:08.291 --> 31:10.208
A-and I'm not gonna
be a teacher.

31:10.291 --> 31:12.709
- Why not?
- Kids think I'm weird.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.000
We'll make it
on my music.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.166
No.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.083
I have to hurry
before my rose is off the
bloom.

31:22.375 --> 31:24.583
I think your
rose
is just fine.

31:26.875 --> 31:29.000
You love me, right, Bingo?

31:29.083 --> 31:30.250
Of course I do.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.291
Then we should
get married.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.083
Settle down.

31:34.166 --> 31:36.667
Buy a house, a car,
start a savings account.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.166
You'll need a job,
a steady paycheck.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.166
We don't need
any of that.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.792
We got love
and music

31:41.875 --> 31:44.458
the only things
that are real
anyhow.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.125
Huh, you remember?

31:47.625 --> 31:48.959
'Bingo..'

31:49.041 --> 31:52.583
...if that telegram
from "Bandstand" were coming..

31:52.667 --> 31:54.917
...it would have made it
already.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.291
It's time to grow up.

31:59.458 --> 32:00.667
You need
to be realistic

32:00.750 --> 32:03.041
about the limitations
of your talent.

32:05.542 --> 32:07.000
And you're just not..

32:07.083 --> 32:08.834
...that talented.

32:14.250 --> 32:16.417
But we can be happy together.

32:17.959 --> 32:20.166
Settled.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.291
Safe.

32:25.417 --> 32:27.250
Right, Bingo?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.959
I'll talk to my uncle.

32:34.041 --> 32:36.291
He's probably
still at the
store.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.208
I love you, Bingo.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.917
It was a lie, of course.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.375
Bingo was tremendously talented.

32:55.458 --> 32:59.291
But talent ain't the
same
as security.

32:59.375 --> 33:00.417
Mm.

33:01.625 --> 33:03.834
And the next morning
Bingo was dead.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.834
Turns out..

33:06.917 --> 33:08.875
...security doesn't exist.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.583
(Rush)
'What's up?'

33:16.667 --> 33:19.542
Warrant came through
on the old five and dime.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.875
'Feel like fishing
for a bullet?'

33:22.542 --> 33:23.875
What do we got?

33:23.959 --> 33:26.041
Did some more digging
on nitrocellulose.

33:26.125 --> 33:28.333
Turns out it was
used
for making records.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.917
The old recording booth
in the five and dime.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.583
You know,
if Bingo was recordin'

33:40.667 --> 33:43.709
when he got shot, he could have
fallen back into the record.

33:43.792 --> 33:46.250
(Stillman)
'That's how he got
nitrocellulose on his
sleeve.'

33:54.500 --> 33:56.792
(Vera)
Looks like karma's
on our side today.

33:58.792 --> 34:01.000
.40 or .45.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.792
Wasn't common back in the '50s.

34:02.875 --> 34:07.458
Street thugs were
using
.38 revolvers then.

34:07.542 --> 34:11.000
But my father had a .45.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.041
World War II military issue.

34:13.125 --> 34:14.750
He an officer like Uncle Ed?

34:14.834 --> 34:17.083
War hero, too.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.041
We know Ed worked nights
at the five and dime.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.041
Gettin' made over
by the makeup girl.

34:22.125 --> 34:24.709
If Bingo caught him,
it could've turned ugly.

34:29.375 --> 34:31.166
Your husband wasn't
at home with you

34:31.250 --> 34:34.125
the night
of Bingo's murder.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.417
He was at the five and
dime,
wasn't he?

34:37.417 --> 34:39.000
I'm not sure.

34:39.083 --> 34:41.125
Frankly, it was so long ago.

34:41.208 --> 34:44.583
Spent a lot of nights
at the store, old Ed.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.750
And not by his lonesome, either.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.875
I used to tell myself that

34:53.959 --> 34:57.083
she was for his urges..

34:57.166 --> 35:00.834
...and I was the one
he truly loved.

35:00.917 --> 35:02.959
Now you know I'm a fool.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.041
We found a bullet.

35:08.125 --> 35:11.375
Matches the type of gun
Mr. Valentine used in the
war.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.333
Ed was a philanderer,
but he..

35:13.417 --> 35:15.917
He-he never would've hurt
his own nephew, his own blood.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.250
His own blood caught
him
with his pants down.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.500
Could've ruined his marriage,
his reputation.

35:20.583 --> 35:23.083
Isn't it time to stop
protecting your
husband?

35:25.583 --> 35:29.041
Ed wasn't with me that night.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.291
But he wasn't at the store,
either.

35:40.834 --> 35:41.750
Oh, sorry to scare you.

35:41.834 --> 35:43.375
Oh, no, you didn't scare me.

35:43.458 --> 35:45.375
I'm just, um, uh, looking
for Uncle Ed.

35:45.458 --> 35:46.875
Oh, he's at the store, dear.

35:46.959 --> 35:49.500
No, ma'am, I just came
from there and, uh, he..

36:01.458 --> 36:04.083
It's one thing when he's
doing it behind closed doors

36:04.166 --> 36:06.291
but to go out with her..

36:07.625 --> 36:09.333
Someone could see.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.375
My marriage
just one big stinking
lie

36:14.458 --> 36:17.375
and I am a fool
to believe
otherwise.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.166
But it isn't foolish to believe.

36:19.250 --> 36:20.542
If only I had
gone
to college

36:20.625 --> 36:23.000
I could've done
something with my
life.

36:24.417 --> 36:26.208
I dropped out for him.

36:26.291 --> 36:27.667
To start a family.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.166
A home.

36:29.250 --> 36:31.000
Well, maybe
it isn't too late.

36:31.083 --> 36:32.917
It is for me.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.166
[sniffles]
But I was good at
it.

36:36.333 --> 36:38.417
I loved it, you know.

36:41.667 --> 36:45.375
Nobody should keep you
from doing what you love.

36:49.959 --> 36:52.417
There's something
I need to show
you.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.125
That's from "Bandstand."

37:01.208 --> 37:03.875
They saw you perform,
Bingo, and they liked
you.

37:03.959 --> 37:05.166
A lot.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.667
They want a record to play
for their producers..

37:07.750 --> 37:08.709
...by tomorrow morning.

37:08.792 --> 37:11.125
Well, you'd better hurry.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.250
Oh.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.625
Use the recording
booth
at the store.

37:15.709 --> 37:16.667
But I don't know
what to sing.

37:16.750 --> 37:18.125
Well, you must have something.

37:18.208 --> 37:20.959
I-I have an original,
actually,
been puzzling together.

37:21.875 --> 37:23.458
Not ready, though.

37:23.542 --> 37:24.917
You can't get the chorus right.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.750
Let-let's hear it.

37:26.834 --> 37:27.709
Uh..

37:33.250 --> 37:34.500
I...it just
doesn't work.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.917
Chance. You can't rhyme chance
with chance.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.291
Dance.

37:38.375 --> 37:40.166
You only get one dance.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.542
That's it.

37:41.625 --> 37:43.250
That's great.

37:50.583 --> 37:51.917
- Oh.
- Oh.

37:54.959 --> 37:56.375
Um.

37:56.458 --> 37:58.375
What if I'm no good?

37:58.458 --> 38:00.500
What if you are?

38:02.583 --> 38:05.458
No one should stop you
from doing what you love,
Bingo.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.917
Ed came in
a few minutes later..

38:15.000 --> 38:18.750
...reeking of cheap perfume
and whiskey.

38:18.834 --> 38:20.750
And you never left him.

38:20.834 --> 38:23.333
I should've.

38:23.417 --> 38:25.208
But then Bingo..

38:25.875 --> 38:26.875
I stayed.

38:26.959 --> 38:28.542
Arranged the funeral.

38:28.625 --> 38:31.750
Kept up appearances.

38:31.834 --> 38:33.333
It was easier.

38:34.959 --> 38:36.750
That chorus.

38:36.834 --> 38:38.625
You ever tell
anyone
about it?

38:38.709 --> 38:40.959
No. Why?

38:41.041 --> 38:42.750
"I'll take my chance

38:42.834 --> 38:44.625
"'Cause truth be told

38:44.709 --> 38:47.709
You only get one dance."

38:47.792 --> 38:50.917
You weren't
at Wishing Star practice,
JP.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.417
You were at home.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.667
You must be confused.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.083
We talked
to your old
pals.

38:58.166 --> 38:59.709
They kicked you out.

38:59.792 --> 39:02.750
Wanted to play
rock 'n' roll.

39:02.834 --> 39:04.125
Not you, though.

39:04.208 --> 39:06.166
You heard your mother
confess
she was trapped

39:06.250 --> 39:07.417
in a loveless marriage

39:07.500 --> 39:09.417
and that your
father
was a philanderer.

39:09.500 --> 39:13.417
Before Bingo came along
everything made sense.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.458
You father was a great war hero

39:15.542 --> 39:17.834
your mother,
the doting
housewife.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.208
(Stillman)
'And you..'

39:19.291 --> 39:22.000
...the golden boy
everyone wanted to
be.

39:22.083 --> 39:26.709
But Bingo had that new style,
that cool new sound.

39:26.792 --> 39:29.291
And everyone in your life
started changing because of
him.

39:29.375 --> 39:30.667
No.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.083
Bingo was a fream.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.291
He didn't have the power
to change people.

39:34.375 --> 39:36.083
But he did.

39:36.166 --> 39:37.917
That's why you had
to get rid of him.

39:38.041 --> 39:40.083
Restore your
world
to its rightful
place.

39:40.166 --> 39:43.959
Do you really think that I
could
shoot my own cousin?

39:44.041 --> 39:45.083
No.

39:46.667 --> 39:49.500
You didn't need to.

39:49.583 --> 39:51.083
But it happened.

39:55.667 --> 40:00.125
I just wanted him...to leave.

40:00.208 --> 40:02.875
I wanted my life
back the way it was.

40:05.041 --> 40:07.750
So you took your father's gun..

40:07.834 --> 40:10.458
...to scare him off.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.959
But he wouldn't listen,
would he?

40:15.792 --> 40:17.583
I..

40:17.667 --> 40:21.625
...just...wanted him..

40:21.709 --> 40:22.792
...gone.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.959
Jeez, JP, you scared me
half to death.

40:51.041 --> 40:53.125
- We have to leave now.
- What?

40:53.208 --> 40:56.500
I'm taking you back to
Brandywine where you belong.

40:56.583 --> 40:57.709
What's wrong with you?

40:57.792 --> 41:01.166
I heard the lies
that you made my mother
say.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.500
I'm about the only one
not lying.

41:02.583 --> 41:07.000
Everything was
perfect
until you came.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.166
Perfect?

41:08.250 --> 41:09.917
What's so perfect
about a smart woman

41:10.000 --> 41:14.875
like your mom baking cookies
instead of following her
dream?

41:14.959 --> 41:17.250
Or a guy like Aces getting
fired
just 'cause he's colored?

41:17.333 --> 41:19.291
Shut up!
You don't know
anything.

41:19.375 --> 41:21.083
What's perfect about
Miranda out of her gourd

41:21.166 --> 41:23.834
'cause she's scared
she's nothin' without a man.

41:23.917 --> 41:25.291
It's a twisted world, JP.

41:25.375 --> 41:28.875
It ain't all puppy dogs
and holding hands.

41:28.959 --> 41:30.959
- Open your eyes.
- I was happy.

41:31.041 --> 41:32.542
Everyone was happy.

41:32.625 --> 41:35.792
My family was happy.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.291
And I'm gonna make sure
they're happy again.

41:39.959 --> 41:42.625
I know times are changin'
and for the good.

41:42.709 --> 41:47.041
And I'm seeing to it
the only way I know how.

41:47.125 --> 41:49.208
Not if I can help it.
