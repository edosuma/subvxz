[Vanjie] Miss Vanjie.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.165
Miss Vanjie?

01:05.165 --> 01:07.701
Miss Vanjie?

01:09.770 --> 01:10.871
Bitch, I'm back.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.741
I'm back by popular demand,

01:14.741 --> 01:16.610
In Season 10,
I was the first girl out.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.279
Miss Vanjie. Miss Vanjie.

01:19.279 --> 01:22.549
I was humiliate--
humiliated.

01:22.549 --> 01:23.884
I was embarrassed.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.486
I thought I was a failure
and I wanted to hide.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.587
It was the worst.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.256
Oh, bitch.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.591
But then when
the whole Miss Vanjie thing

01:31.591 --> 01:34.628
went haywire on social media,

01:34.628 --> 01:37.431
bitch, I made lemonade
out of lemons.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.533
Whoa. Let me just go ahead
and do it now.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.168
Thank y'all.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.170
Appreciate you.
Cut the check later, bitch.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.006
I feel very lucky to be back.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.275
♪ Get those cookies,
get those cookies ♪

01:48.275 --> 01:49.643
I want to show America
that I'm more than just a meme.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.279
I'm not a one-episode
trick pony.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.714
I'm hiding, bitch.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.883
I'm about to hide and see
what ho's walk in this door.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.151
'Cause I don't want them
to know I'm here just yet.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.393
Welcome to Season 11.

02:06.393 --> 02:12.099
It looks like things just got...
eleven-dary.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.534
My name is Nina West
and I am 39 years old.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.269
I'm the first one.

02:16.269 --> 02:17.938
I am a comedy queen.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.974
I have taken my influences
from the Muppets,

02:20.974 --> 02:22.943
Pee Wee Herman,
Harvey Fierstein.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.212
Oh, my God.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.446
I write my own shows
and produce them.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.881
I won National Entertainer
of the Year

02:27.881 --> 02:30.550
with my legendary moving dress

02:30.550 --> 02:31.818
that was copied by Sia.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.187
This is unbelievable.

02:34.187 --> 02:37.024
So if the queens,
if they know who I am,

02:37.024 --> 02:39.893
I think some are gonna go,
fuck, she's here.

02:42.896 --> 02:47.901
Get ready, y'all, 'cause
this sugar is so sweet.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.936
I'm Shuga Cain, I'm 24,

02:49.936 --> 02:52.005
and I'm from New York City.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.540
[laughs]

02:55.075 --> 02:56.810
Do I really have to say 40?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.812
Oh, shit.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.714
Shuga Cain can do anything.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.150
She does the booty,
she does the Vanjie.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.686
-Hi.
-Hey, girl.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.188
I don't want people
to come to my show

03:08.188 --> 03:09.923
and be like, oh, we know
what Shuga's gonna do today.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.058
How long you been doing drag?

03:11.058 --> 03:12.526
I've been doing drag
for 17 years.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.760
Holy shit.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.295
I've been doing it like legit

03:15.295 --> 03:16.396
for like a year and a half.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.764
Wow!

03:17.764 --> 03:18.999
I just did it on a whim

03:18.999 --> 03:20.834
and it just ended up
being the thing.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.205
I decided to quit my job
and do drag full time.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.941
And I shit you not,
like two days later,

03:27.941 --> 03:30.343
I got a call from Drag Race.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.412
It's crazy.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.881
[laughs]

03:40.821 --> 03:45.592
[speaking Vietnamese]

03:45.592 --> 03:47.761
I'm Plastique Tiara,
and I'm from Dallas, Texas.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.197
I like to describe my drag
as like the three Ps:

03:50.197 --> 03:52.599
polished, persistent,
and pussy.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.901
[laughs]

03:54.901 --> 03:56.403
I been playing tricks on you.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.404
This bitch is stunning.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.939
It's not Instagram filters.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.240
The bitch is stun-ning.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.375
-Hi, sister.
-Hey.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.410
Hi.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.979
I grew up
in Saigon, Vietnam,

04:05.979 --> 04:08.348
so a lot of my drag inspirations

04:08.348 --> 04:10.784
come from Vietnamese pop stars.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.352
I just turned 21 last month.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.222
I could be
your grandmother, girl.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.058
I think most queens

04:18.058 --> 04:19.726
would think that,
oh, she's young

04:19.726 --> 04:21.228
and she's just pretty.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.063
What else can she do?

04:23.063 --> 04:25.432
But I have some stuff
in my repertoire.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.466
21?

04:26.466 --> 04:28.235
I'm still gagged
about that. 21.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.903
Ooh.

04:36.576 --> 04:41.715
[ululating]

04:41.715 --> 04:43.617
Okay.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.052
I'm Mercedes Iman Diamond,

04:46.052 --> 04:49.322
and I am the African princess.

04:49.322 --> 04:52.325
I'm from Mombasa, Kenya.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.995
I moved to America
when I was 11.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.630
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hi, gorgeous.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.734
My drag is all about body,
oddy, jewels.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.435
Bling, bling, bling, honey.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.436
What's your name?
I missed it when you came in.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.071
Mercedes. Just like
the car Mercedes.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.006
[Shuga] Mercedes,
Yes, honey, rich.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.275
You will never miss that, baby.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.442
More like a Buick.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.512
Hold on, bitch. What?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.948
[laughs]

05:18.952 --> 05:19.953
Ooh.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.190
The world wants me,

05:23.190 --> 05:26.793
and the feeling is mutual.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.329
My name is Scarlet Envy.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.766
I am southern beauty
and New York City grit.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.000
Come on, waist.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.336
My drag is about
embracing the beauty

05:36.336 --> 05:37.971
that you were blessed with.

05:37.971 --> 05:41.474
I happen to be very blessed.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.843
[cheering]

05:43.843 --> 05:45.579
What a big day for us.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.047
Fellow New Yorker
in the house, honey.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.182
-Yes!
-Yes!

05:49.182 --> 05:51.685
[Scarlet] Well, I worked
the birth of Venus today,

05:51.685 --> 05:55.255
and she is Venus with a penis.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.524
[laughs]

06:01.661 --> 06:03.663
This honey is raw
and unfiltered.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.365
I'm Honey Davenport,

06:05.365 --> 06:07.334
and I'm New York City's
crown jewel.

06:07.334 --> 06:10.503
Honey's style is anything
the hell I feel like that day.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.039
I always say like
I might wear Givenchy,

06:13.039 --> 06:14.541
but labels don't fit me.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.543
[cheering]

06:16.543 --> 06:19.879
I'm so gagged that
Miss Honey Davenport is here

06:19.879 --> 06:21.548
'cause she is huge
in New York City.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.916
She's a legend there.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.517
I love a good competition, girl,

06:24.517 --> 06:27.420
but I wouldn't call myself
a pageant queen.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.589
I'm a performer
who exceeds limits.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.092
Just two months ago,
I was in an off-Broadway show.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.860
I used to have my own band.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.729
I just don't fit
into any single box

06:35.729 --> 06:36.830
or type of drag.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.231
[Honey] So do you guys think

06:38.231 --> 06:39.899
there's going to be
any surprises this season?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.468
Oh, absolutely, girl.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.535
Do you think
there's anyone coming back?

06:42.535 --> 06:44.271
-Returning?
-Yeah, returning back.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.372
[Scarlet]
Girl, I think I know.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.940
I have a guess.
I have a guess.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.074
Let's say all on three.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.743
One, two, three.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.279
[all] Vanjie.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.680
[Scarlet] Vanjie.
[all laugh]

06:53.680 --> 06:55.148
Y'all think that's funny?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.784
[cheering]

06:57.784 --> 07:00.287
I was hiding back there,
bitch,

07:00.287 --> 07:03.356
with my ADD ass
ready to come on out.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.357
Come on, Scarlet.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.825
Shuga.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.227
[Honey] Vanjie's back.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.362
This doll
deserves a second chance.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.031
I'm excited to see

07:11.031 --> 07:13.199
what she's gonna do
second time around.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.868
I feel like I should
start looking around

07:14.868 --> 07:16.236
for anyone else in here.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.904
-Is anybody over here?
-[all laugh]

07:17.904 --> 07:19.906
Aah, yes!

07:22.642 --> 07:24.611
Oh, fish filet, bitch.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.813
Oh, yes, it's me,
Miss A'Keria.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.716
D-A-V-E-N-P-O-R--

07:29.716 --> 07:32.886
and as you can see,
I'm the motherfucking T.

07:32.886 --> 07:36.723
[cheering]
I am A'Keria Chanel Davenport,

07:36.723 --> 07:39.659
all the way from that
fabulous House of Davenport,

07:39.659 --> 07:43.063
where we love to drag,
and this season it will show.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.732
My drag is in your face.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.567
It's very sexy and shiny.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.835
[Vanjie]
I don't see the pageant.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.403
Wait. Which one you won, sis?

07:50.403 --> 07:52.539
Renaissance Universe?

07:52.539 --> 07:55.308
[all laugh and cheer]

07:55.308 --> 07:57.143
I'm the current
reigning Miss Black Universe.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.479
You know what? I do
consider myself a pageant queen.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.214
I know some of y'all
don't like that word,

08:01.214 --> 08:04.250
but, hey, I'm gonna
change your mind on it.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.285
I can bet you that.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.654
So how many Davenports
are there?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.356
-Do we know?
[A'Keria] Oh, girl, listen.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.157
We're gonna do
Season 12 Davenport.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.626
Yes!
[all laugh]

08:13.626 --> 08:15.495
[beep beep]

08:19.332 --> 08:20.667
What the--

08:22.268 --> 08:23.937
Move over, ladies.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.940
This race just took an odd turn.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.442
Oh, girl, the circus
is in town, Mary.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.711
My name is Yvie Oddly,

08:31.711 --> 08:34.547
and I'm Denver's commodity
of drag oddity.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.984
Denver predominantly
had the sparkly, dancing

08:37.984 --> 08:40.253
like bodysuit,
hair-flipping queens,

08:40.253 --> 08:41.955
and I shook that up.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.724
The inspirations I draw from

08:44.724 --> 08:47.360
are Mugler, Alexander McQueen,
Christine Booth,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.162
'cause she's so nuts.
[laughs]

08:49.162 --> 08:52.165
So she's house slithering.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.099
Wake up. Oh, it's a snake.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.267
Don't mind my tag-along.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.168
Mama.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.638
I'm really confused

08:58.638 --> 09:01.441
as to why Hot Wheels
needs to make an appearance

09:01.441 --> 09:03.176
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.145
What kind of drag
do you do, girl?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.513
I'm a conceptual queen.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.382
I'm just here to shock
and incite shit.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.384
[Vanjie] We're trying
to get acquainted.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.320
She trying to get fucked.
Girl.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.994
Okay.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.930
Munch, munch, crunch, crunch.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.366
Silky Ganache is here
to eat the lunch.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.268
[cheering]

09:28.268 --> 09:30.703
[laughter and cheering]

09:30.703 --> 09:34.240
Introduced to some,
reacquainted to others.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.643
She is the creamy, the dreamy,

09:36.643 --> 09:38.378
the Southern Belle herself,

09:38.378 --> 09:41.214
and she goes by
the delicious name

09:41.214 --> 09:44.417
of Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.319
Bitch, Silk
got the good old milk.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.754
[cheering]

09:47.754 --> 09:49.856
Silky can do anything.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.559
I have jumped on
a U.S. Postal truck

09:52.559 --> 09:54.928
in the middle of my show
and drove off.

09:54.928 --> 09:55.929
I've done it all.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.997
-Hello, gorgeous.
-I'm Yvie.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.900
I want to use this platform
to further my career.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.869
You know,
having my own spinoff show,

10:02.869 --> 10:04.537
which I want coming in the door,

10:04.537 --> 10:06.039
and I'm gonna be honest
about that.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.208
Or my own cooking show,

10:08.208 --> 10:10.076
which I want as well.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.644
I just wanna entertain.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.113
Aah!

10:13.113 --> 10:15.014
Silky, you nasty thing.

10:15.014 --> 10:18.118
Yes, big Silky in the building.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.954
Silky's my girl. Me and Silky
go all the way back.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.089
She's bigger than life
just like she's big herself.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.657
But she will talk
your ear off, baby.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.459
[Silky] I got
my own brunch show.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.962
It's secret. We actually
do something at the show.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.763
It's my thing.
I say "attitude check,"

10:30.763 --> 10:32.265
and everybody got to scream,
"fuck you, bitch!"

10:32.265 --> 10:33.967
[cheering]
Okay.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.935
Attitude check!

10:35.935 --> 10:37.971
[all] Fuck you, bitch!

10:45.278 --> 10:49.249
Never fear.
The queen of the north is here.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.317
Is she international?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.519
My name is Brooke Lynn Hytes,

10:52.519 --> 10:54.587
and I'm not quite
Canadian bacon.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.556
I'm more Canadian turkey bacon

10:56.556 --> 10:57.991
because I'm a little bit leaner
than bacon.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.025
I grew up in Toronto, Canada,

10:59.025 --> 11:01.461
but I now live
in Nashville, Tennessee.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.364
-What up, girl!
-[cheering]

11:04.364 --> 11:05.965
-Aah!
-Aah!

11:05.965 --> 11:08.835
I was a professional
ballet dancer for six years,

11:08.835 --> 11:12.205
so my drag centers around
dancing and movement.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.875
Half my toenail actually
fell off last night. [laughs]

11:15.875 --> 11:17.410
[Scarlet] So how do you two
know each other?

11:17.410 --> 11:20.013
The first time I met you was at
the first pageant I ever did,

11:20.013 --> 11:22.715
EOY, and she was a former
entertainer of the year,

11:22.715 --> 11:24.417
and we just hit it off
and clicked.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.686
And so what year
did you win Continental?

11:26.686 --> 11:27.687
2014.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.757
Get the hell out.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.191
Get out!

11:32.191 --> 11:34.260
Brooke Lynn's
a former Miss Continental,

11:34.260 --> 11:37.196
and that's a really big thing
for us pageant girls.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.932
Bitch, we got some
pageant queens in this hole.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.067
[all laugh]

11:41.067 --> 11:44.037
I didn't really have
much of a reaction.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.773
It's drag I've seen before.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.242
She's sparkling,
she's wearing platinum hair,

11:49.242 --> 11:51.611
and...whoo-hoo.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.018
Now this is what dreams
are made of.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.753
Yes.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.855
Is that Ariel Versace?

12:02.855 --> 12:05.792
I'm Ariel Versace,
and I'm 26 years old.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.194
Ariel is basically like
if Lisa Frank

12:08.194 --> 12:09.896
threw up on a drag queen.
That's me.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.032
She's your little pop princess,
life-size Bratz doll.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.534
Oh, it's a fish.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.636
I have almost like
80.000 followers on Instagram,

12:16.636 --> 12:19.038
but I think it's really annoying

12:19.038 --> 12:22.141
when people are always like, oh,
you know, Ariel from Instagram.

12:22.141 --> 12:25.678
Ariel can sing, she can act,
she can dance.

12:25.678 --> 12:26.746
And if you're gonna
come see me in a show,

12:26.746 --> 12:28.715
I'm not just
gonna stand there like...

12:28.715 --> 12:30.783
I'm gonna turn it out.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.619
[Shuga] This is turning out
to be like the pageant season.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.820
Are you like
a pageant queen or...

12:33.820 --> 12:35.088
[Ariel] I've competed
in pageants,

12:35.088 --> 12:36.623
but that's not like
what I do, though,

12:36.623 --> 12:38.458
because I get really bitchy
in pageants

12:38.458 --> 12:40.259
'cause I'm in it to win it
kind of gig, so...

12:40.259 --> 12:42.428
Oh. That's the real Tee.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.100
[cheering]

12:47.100 --> 12:49.602
Extra, extra,
read all about it.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.504
Ra'Jah O'Hara's in the house,

12:51.504 --> 12:53.406
and I hope you came to play.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.608
My name is Ra'Jah D. O'Hara.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.243
The "D,"
it's short for Davenport.

12:57.243 --> 12:58.945
I'm from Dallas, Texas,

12:58.945 --> 13:01.247
where everything is bigger,
better, and bolder.

13:01.247 --> 13:04.017
Ra'Jah is a dancing queen.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.786
I'm known for my kicks,
my splits, my energy.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.355
But Ra'Jah is also...

13:10.990 --> 13:11.991
it.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.260
-Hey, girl.
-Hello.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.762
Hi. I'm Big Silky.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.530
Come on, Big Silky. Aah!

13:17.530 --> 13:19.932
Why your earring coming off?

13:19.932 --> 13:21.401
You weren't doing
the electric slide.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.469
You just did two steps, Mary.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.971
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.140
[all laugh]

13:27.140 --> 13:29.142
-Aah!
-Oh!

13:29.142 --> 13:31.911
Both of them, girl.
Both earrings.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.047
This is national television,
honey.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.849
Just staple that shit
to your ear, girl.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.384
That's double sabotage now.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.786
Snatch and change.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.726
Vegas is back in the house,

13:46.726 --> 13:49.295
and this time,
we're winning a jackpot.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.763
You gamble, girl?

13:50.763 --> 13:52.632
I'm Kahanna Montrese,

13:52.632 --> 13:54.500
and if you're gonna say my name,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.035
you've gotta say it right.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.136
It's gotta be seductive.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.806
Like, Kahanna.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.240
Kahanna.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.975
[laughs]

14:02.975 --> 14:06.312
Kahanna's favorite look
is when she's showing her body,

14:06.312 --> 14:08.047
but also just staying true

14:08.047 --> 14:11.350
to like my hip-hop
showgirl dance queen.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.652
Rhinestones out your ass.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.887
Rhinestones
can be for pretty girls.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.856
-Oh, you Coco's daughter.
-Yes.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.492
Okay, she's
Coco Montrese's daughter.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.528
You got a reputation
to live up to.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.063
Let's see
if she lives up to that.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.207
Don't tell me
you're coming to fight.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.074
[all laugh]

14:35.074 --> 14:36.342
[speaking Korean]

14:36.342 --> 14:39.212
I'm Soju,
your K-pop drag princess.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.982
Not only can I look pretty,
but I can also kick ass.

14:42.982 --> 14:46.385
I always love to bring Korean
into my drag.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.021
That's what makes me different.
A lot of people know of me

14:49.021 --> 14:51.791
for my weekly show,
Shot with Soju, on YouTube.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.392
So juicy.
Shake, shake, shake.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.829
Where I review every episode
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

14:56.829 --> 15:00.399
So this is so crazy for me
to be on this side of it.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.368
Aah! Two Asians in the house.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.237
I don't know about y'all,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.205
but a couple of us
was getting Elvis.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.907
[Ariel] You do your YouTube.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.342
How often do you, like,
perform-perform?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.410
I do my YouTube
like twice a week.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.612
But do you like consider
yourself an entertainer

15:12.612 --> 15:14.447
or just kind of like a blogger?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.748
Oh, shit.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.384
Full entertainer, okay?

15:18.384 --> 15:20.286
[Ariel]
I know Soju from online.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.055
I know that she's not
much of a performer,

15:23.055 --> 15:24.791
which doesn't really
make sense to me,

15:24.791 --> 15:25.892
because I'm like, girl,
why are you here?

15:25.892 --> 15:28.060
So I guess
I'm really looking forward

15:28.060 --> 15:30.163
to seeing what she does
to prove me wrong.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.564
[Silky] You know what?

15:31.564 --> 15:32.565
Got to introduce you
to the family.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.967

15:34.967 --> 15:36.569

15:38.471 --> 15:40.940
Guess who back in the house?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.075

Oh, my God!

15:43.075 --> 15:46.078

16:17.276 --> 16:21.113
if you see them popping up
and popping off all season long.

16:21.113 --> 16:26.853

these sugar walls are hotness.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.588
[all laugh]

16:28.588 --> 16:31.657
Which leads us to
your very first photo shoot.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.160
Are you intrigued?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.462
-Yes!
-I thought so.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.297
I know it's not gonna be
a regular photo shoot.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.599

some shenanigans.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.451
Yes, please.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.086
[laughs]

19:47.086 --> 19:49.321
I feel like Ra'Jah
had some good ideas.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.756
-Ooh.
-Aah!

19:50.756 --> 19:53.793
But I just want her
to throw the earrings away

19:53.793 --> 19:55.161
and pose, mama, pose.

19:56.929 --> 20:00.599
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo
and Farrah Moan.

20:00.599 --> 20:03.069
What story
are you telling us, Vanessa?

20:03.069 --> 20:05.504
Two ho's about to get caught
when the police bust through.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.973
I'm scared.
[laughs]

20:07.973 --> 20:09.475
Okay, face the wall, Mary.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.011
I love that Vanessa is just
taking charge of the situation.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.145
Both hands up.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.481
And I'm just gonna trust
her vision,

20:15.481 --> 20:16.982
whether I'm actually visible
or not.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.951
Is this some kind of a bust?

20:18.951 --> 20:21.454
No, just two prostitutes.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.222
So that's an ongoing theme
with you.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.356
[laughs]

20:24.356 --> 20:27.393
Bye. See y'all later.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.396
Child, why did I do
the prostitution route?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.164
[laughs]

20:32.164 --> 20:34.467
Brooke Lynn Hytes
and Ongina.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.701
-I'm gonna lift you up.
-Okay, ready?

20:35.701 --> 20:37.536
One, two, three.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.972
[RuPaul] It's an officer
and a gentle queen.

20:39.972 --> 20:43.409
Sonique, Plastique,
Plastique, Sonique.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.411
You have to serve, girl.

20:45.411 --> 20:49.181
Soju and Porkchop?
That sounds delicious.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.183
[laughs]

20:51.183 --> 20:53.419
[RuPaul] Tae Kwon Do
she better don't.

20:53.419 --> 20:57.123
Ariel Versace and Eureka.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.290
Who's the beauty,
who's the beast?

20:58.290 --> 21:00.693
-Is that a real question?
-[laughs]

21:00.693 --> 21:02.428
Bitch, I will beat
your motherfucking ass.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.864
[all laugh]

21:04.864 --> 21:07.099
[RuPaul] Nina West and Raven.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.935
So you're going
to feed her.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.470
It doesn't look like
she needs to eat, but...

21:11.470 --> 21:14.440
[laughs]

21:14.440 --> 21:17.042
Pages of Vogue magazine,
darling.

21:17.042 --> 21:18.744
[laughs]

21:18.744 --> 21:22.248
Mercedes Iman Diamond
and Delta Work.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.616
While we love on the couch...

21:23.616 --> 21:25.484
-Okay.
-We can sit on the couch.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.752
-The both of us? Together?
-Yes.

21:26.752 --> 21:28.888
All those furs.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.357
So just sit however?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.928
You want Delta to sit
any particular way?

21:35.928 --> 21:40.299
Uh, no, actually.
That'll be...

21:40.299 --> 21:42.635
Just make yourself at home,
Delta.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.803
Mercedes is beautiful.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.740
She was very opulent,
very glamorous.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.308
But I think she was a little
confused by the challenge.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.144
[RuPaul] Delta, would you
like to drive this Mercedes?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.680
I think, um, somebody needs
to be in the driver's seat.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.115
[all laugh]

21:59.018 --> 22:02.321
[RuPaul] Kahanna Montrese
and Derrick Barry.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.856
So we are just
so in love with Bianca.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.826
We're showing everything
but good taste.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.194
[laughs]

22:08.194 --> 22:09.261
Drink.

22:09.261 --> 22:12.298
[RuPaul] Oh, okay, alcoholism.

22:12.298 --> 22:16.035
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport
and Kimora Blac.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.003
How about I feed you
a few cherries, darling?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.005
I don't even like cherries,

22:20.005 --> 22:21.907
because cherries
has a lot of GMO in it,

22:21.907 --> 22:23.309
and I don't eat GMOs.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.710
[RuPaul laughs]

22:24.710 --> 22:26.545
Oh, boy.

22:26.545 --> 22:30.583
Silky Nutmeg Ganache
and Mariah Balenciaga.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.852
Oh, Silky is taking this
art directing seriously.

22:33.852 --> 22:34.854
Oh, fill her up.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.755
You're my kind of queen.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.057
[all laugh]

22:38.057 --> 22:39.692
[RuPaul] Editorial.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.861
Is this Upscale magazine?
Ebony Jet?

22:42.861 --> 22:44.597
What's the story
in this photograph?

22:44.597 --> 22:46.665
We're just two girls
getting ready to go out.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.768
Will you be taking the bus
to the club or an Uber?

22:49.768 --> 22:50.936
Uber-ettes.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.205
[all laugh]

22:53.205 --> 22:55.774
[RuPaul]
Rebbie and La Toya Jackson.

22:55.774 --> 22:58.911
Yvie Oddly and Adore Delano.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.746
I need you to be angrier
with that bell.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.448
All right, bitch.
Let's get angry.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.683
I think Adore and I
are a pretty crazy match.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.453
Aah!

23:07.453 --> 23:08.487
[laughs]

23:08.487 --> 23:09.688
Both of our drags

23:09.688 --> 23:12.091
come out of that chaos
and grunge that I love.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.425
What are you mad at?

23:13.425 --> 23:15.527
I'm mad at the lack of olives.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.029
They're not even stuffed.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.865
[all laugh]

23:19.865 --> 23:24.904
My queens, one of you
has a legendary star power

23:24.904 --> 23:27.206
that outshined all the others.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.044
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,

23:32.044 --> 23:34.914
you are the winner
of this week's mini challenge.

23:34.914 --> 23:39.985
You've won a $2.500 gift card
from Arda Wigs.

23:39.985 --> 23:42.254
Bitch, I stomped them.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.391
I--ooh, my wig.
I stomped them, honey.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.493
Now you know I am
a force to be reckoned with

23:47.493 --> 23:48.294
in this competition.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.998
Yes!

23:52.998 --> 23:55.167
Finally.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.568
Let my dick out.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.637
[Soju] So it's time to de-drag,

23:58.637 --> 24:00.005
and I'm really excited to see

24:00.005 --> 24:02.741
how everyone
is going to turn into boys.

24:02.741 --> 24:06.345
I love drag,
but I love boys more.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.180
Aah.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.649
-Ooh, that feels so good.
-All becoming boys.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.217
I don't even know
who's who right now.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.519
This is so crazy.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.487
I didn't know who was who
to start with, so...

24:15.487 --> 24:16.989
[all laugh]

24:16.989 --> 24:19.024
I'm standing in the corner,

24:19.024 --> 24:20.359
Peeping Tom tease,

24:20.359 --> 24:22.928
watching this Brooke
out of drag, y'all.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.830
I'm sorry y'all
missing in action,

24:24.830 --> 24:26.865
'cause it's good in person.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.034
[Brooke Lynn] Yeah,
I think Vanjie's trade.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.035
I think she's very handsome.

24:30.035 --> 24:31.837
I'm into twinks,

24:31.837 --> 24:34.239
so I think Scarlet is so cute.

24:34.239 --> 24:35.574
When I saw her, I was like...

24:38.544 --> 24:40.179
Damn.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.181
[laughs] Oh, my God.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.449
That looks so thirsty.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.919
Hey, kitty girls.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.755
Hey.
[cheers and applause]

24:49.755 --> 24:52.224
Ladies, I've got some bad news.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.329
All of your luggage was lost.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.297
-What?
-What?

24:59.531 --> 25:01.934
The good news is

25:01.934 --> 25:04.069
until your luggage is found,

25:04.069 --> 25:07.072
a representative
from the airlines

25:07.072 --> 25:12.111
has agreed to let you use some
previously unclaimed luggage.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.312
What the--

25:13.312 --> 25:15.347
Oh, Pit Crew.

25:18.450 --> 25:21.120
[cheers and laughter]

25:21.120 --> 25:22.955
[applause]

25:22.955 --> 25:24.390
Yes!

25:24.390 --> 25:27.459
[RuPaul] Ladies,
for your first maxi challenge,

25:27.459 --> 25:32.931
each of you needs to create
your own unique legendary look

25:32.931 --> 25:35.834
using only the junk
inside these trunks.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.138
Lucky for you,
each of these trunks

25:39.138 --> 25:43.308
once belonged
to a Drag Race legend.

25:43.308 --> 25:46.478
Now, Silky,
you won the mini challenge,

25:46.478 --> 25:49.181
so you get to assign the trunks.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.215
Silky.

25:51.683 --> 25:52.951
I want the Violet Chachki box

25:52.951 --> 25:55.220
because I know
there will be sequins,

25:55.220 --> 25:59.124
there'll be lingerie that I can
make into a very cute outfit.

25:59.124 --> 26:00.559
Violet's.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.861
Now remember who was kiki-ing
with you and who wasn't.

26:02.861 --> 26:06.265
So, Silky, which trunk
do you pick for yourself?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.566
The biggest one, Peppermint.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.468
[RuPaul] How refreshing.

26:09.468 --> 26:10.702
I could eat
little peppermints.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.938
Okay.
[all laugh]

26:12.938 --> 26:16.408

26:32.958 --> 26:34.460

26:34.460 --> 26:36.695
We all deserve to be here.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.832
If you go home, you goin' home
on your own accord.

26:39.832 --> 26:43.302

for their own spinoff.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.475
[laughter and applause]

27:56.475 --> 27:57.809
All right.
Thank you, Silky.

27:57.809 --> 27:59.711
You can join the other girls.

28:02.414 --> 28:06.518

legendary look is right here.

28:06.518 --> 28:12.491
But remember, the final look
needs to be 100% your style.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.928
Gentlemen, start your engines,

28:15.928 --> 28:18.397

28:36.048 --> 28:37.182
I'm gonna need this.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.784
[Scarlet laughs]

28:38.784 --> 28:41.987
Baby, I'm having flashbacks.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.155
Use your context clues.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.790
You already know
what my biggest fear is.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.293
It's literally
a head and legs,

28:48.293 --> 28:49.962
and the rest is flowers.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.830
I'm thinking, oh, my God.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.065
I'm back here,
the first episode.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.901
If I do not pass
this first episode...

28:55.901 --> 28:57.169
Girl.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.303
Do you have a plan?

28:58.303 --> 28:59.905
Yeah, I'm doing a swimsuit
with a bustle,

28:59.905 --> 29:02.074
and I'm gonna to cut
some pieces out of this.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.909
So the main thing
I'm focusing on

29:03.909 --> 29:05.611
is making sure
my silhouette is there

29:05.611 --> 29:07.079
and they can see my body.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.247
Not everyone gets the chance
to come back

29:09.247 --> 29:10.248
and redeem themselves.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.584
So I feel like I'm lucky

29:12.584 --> 29:14.019
and I'm not gonna mess up
this opportunity.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.588
No, bitch, I cannot.

29:16.588 --> 29:20.759
Come on, Bertha.
Work, Bertha.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.960
[all laugh]

29:24.563 --> 29:26.198
I got such a good box.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.633
Not the first time
I've heard that.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.301
Kim Chi's box
is really inspiring me

29:29.301 --> 29:31.169
to turn some looks.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.105
The first thing
that I'm thinking about

29:33.105 --> 29:34.339
is my Korean heritage.

29:34.339 --> 29:36.541
You know, this is
my first dress I'm making.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.043
Really?

29:38.043 --> 29:39.044
You ain't never
made a dress before?

29:39.044 --> 29:40.512
Yeah, but I'm excited.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.014
I feel like I got it.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.850
So when I see all these tulles
and all these colors,

29:44.850 --> 29:47.653
I immediately think Hanbok.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.154
It's a Korean dress

29:49.154 --> 29:52.024
that all the women in Korea
wear for special occasions.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.159
It doesn't really
show your waist,

29:54.159 --> 29:55.327
which means
that I don't have to cinch,

29:55.327 --> 29:58.397
and I don't have
to put my paddings on.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.632
[Vanjie]
Ooh, that's a lot of tulle.

30:00.632 --> 30:05.270
Last time I had that much tulle,
I got the boot, sis.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.606
I'm not trying
to say nothin', but...

30:07.606 --> 30:09.141
[Soju] Vanjie, don't do it.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.677
Just make sure
you have a silhouette, sis.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.985
[Silky] Bitch, what is this?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.020
Why you looking stressed out?

30:22.020 --> 30:23.689
They give me two yards
of each fabric, honey.

30:23.689 --> 30:24.956
What that gonna do?

30:24.956 --> 30:26.491
That don't cover nothin'
but a thigh.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.528
I need like three more yards
of fabric with my fat ass.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.564
Silky says that she
doesn't have enough materials

30:32.564 --> 30:34.099
to make a finished garment.

30:34.099 --> 30:36.868
But I'm looking at it and, girl,
there's more than enough.

30:36.868 --> 30:39.071
[Silky] My brain
just won't think, honey.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.939
Sometimes you have
to let the Lord use you,

30:40.939 --> 30:42.074
and He ain't used me yet.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.309
Well, you better hurry up
and speed dial.

30:44.309 --> 30:46.445
Silky knows that she's on TV,

30:46.445 --> 30:49.381
and she's here
to make her screen time,

30:49.381 --> 30:50.449
rather than working
on her garment.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.717
Sit.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.286
Oh!
[cheering]

30:54.286 --> 30:56.521
[Vanjie] Stop the madness, Mary.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.923
Oh, my God.

30:57.923 --> 31:01.393
Honey, I got to be the big
personality of the season.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.728
Okay, okay, okay.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.397
Okay, bitch.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.200
So not only is Silky
not happy with what she got,

31:08.200 --> 31:09.801
which is what she chose,

31:09.801 --> 31:12.571
but she's making her way
around the workroom

31:12.571 --> 31:14.606
doing all of her
saying boom-cat-cat

31:14.606 --> 31:16.641
that she's been doing since
she walked into the door.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.177
You get a peppermint.
You get a peppermint.

31:19.177 --> 31:21.146
Everybody get a peppermint.

31:21.146 --> 31:24.549
Silky should probably head
back over to her peppermint box

31:24.549 --> 31:27.652
and figure out how she's gonna
sweeten up this runway.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.621
[Silky] I just wanna see
if everybody remember this.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.389
Excuse me,
everybody's attention.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.225
Attitude check!

31:33.225 --> 31:36.027
[silence]

31:36.027 --> 31:37.929
So y'all gonna do me like that?

31:40.599 --> 31:43.001
-Come on, Laganja.
-Okurrr.

31:43.001 --> 31:45.036
It's a known fact
that an evening bag

31:45.036 --> 31:47.272
is due to a lady carrying it.

31:47.272 --> 31:48.273
Is that it goes?

31:48.273 --> 31:49.608
[Soju] I have no idea.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.343
For our very first
maxi challenge,

31:51.343 --> 31:53.445
we have to create
legendary looks

31:53.445 --> 31:57.749
using materials
from Drag Race alumni.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.353
And trust, if anybody knows the
pressure of the first runway.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.491
Girl, I got
the cocktail patch, bitch.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.360
You catching my vibe, bitch?

32:08.360 --> 32:09.795
Yes, bitch,
I'm catching the vibe.

32:09.795 --> 32:10.796
-You're catching my vibe.
-I'm catching the vibe, girl.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.097
So my plan with Katya's box

32:12.097 --> 32:14.132
is mix a little bit of Katya

32:14.132 --> 32:16.168
with a little bit
of my hip-hop showgirl.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.504
I can definitely see
where our drag meets.

32:19.504 --> 32:21.206
I am a dance queen.

32:21.206 --> 32:22.340
She gives a lot of that
in her aesthetic.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.042
She used to be a gymnast.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.510
I used to do gymnastics.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.579
So I can make this work.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.648
If I pull this off,
I'm going on Project Runway.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.882
Okay. [laughs]

32:30.882 --> 32:34.186
-But they just cut it.
-[laughs]

32:34.186 --> 32:35.787
How comfortable would you guys
say you are with sewing?

32:35.787 --> 32:38.456
I know my strengths.
My strengths are not sewing.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.960
RuPaul says every year
"Know how to sew."

32:41.960 --> 32:46.398
I know how to sew,
but I'm not very good at it.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.501
Girl, I just am lost
with all of this.

32:49.501 --> 32:50.535
Remember,
this is not Thorgy's style.

32:50.535 --> 32:51.536
It's your style.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.271
I know, I know.
I can use this.

32:53.271 --> 32:55.040
I can cover this
and create like a hat

32:55.040 --> 32:58.043
or something with it.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.511
Or not.

33:00.879 --> 33:03.715
I really am struggling.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.985
I have auditioned for this show
nine times.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.854
And I want to rise to the level

33:08.854 --> 33:11.923
that everyone thinks
that I'm going to bring.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.425
That's scary.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.927
Oh, God, I really don't know.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.096
Girl, calm down.

33:18.096 --> 33:21.199
Nina seems
really unsure of herself,

33:21.199 --> 33:23.735
which is crazy
because this is Nina West.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.838
Like this is a drag legend
in our community.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.807
I'm trying to like
think outside the box

33:28.807 --> 33:30.141
with this fabric.

33:30.141 --> 33:32.377
Like, why are you
in your head, mama?

33:34.446 --> 33:36.514
[Crew member] Just moments, BJ.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.816
[Miley] All right, Dunkie.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.818
This is awesome.

33:39.818 --> 33:40.919
Hey, what's up? It's me.

33:40.919 --> 33:44.089
Barry Johnson AKA BJ.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.590
You know why.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.425
Don't want to get
too Mariah Carey with it.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.961
But my friends
call me Miley Cyrus

33:49.961 --> 33:52.264
AKA Hannah Montana.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.500
All right, I'm gonna go and meet
the queens for the first time,

33:55.500 --> 33:57.335
but they don't know
they're meeting me.

33:57.335 --> 34:00.739
So I am the guest judge
this week on the panel,

34:00.739 --> 34:04.009
but first, I wanted to go
undercover with the ladies.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.111
I love me some
fucking beautiful women.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.946
Pretty excited about this.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.981
So I'm going in
as a crew member.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.182
Can I tuck this
into your back pocket?

34:11.182 --> 34:12.584
-Tuck away.
-Thank you.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.986
They're never gonna know
what hit 'em.

34:14.986 --> 34:17.322
If you ain't tucked, you ain't
part of the fucking party.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.491
Coming at 'em with the Beej.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.426
Season 11's
not gonna know what hit 'em.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.332
[A'Keria] Miss Vanjie.

34:27.332 --> 34:28.967
You're not sitting
over there by yourself, baby.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.136
[Vanjie] Girl, I did that
last year, there was no space.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.804
I learned my lesson quick.

34:36.441 --> 34:38.543
♪ Ooh, ooh ♪

34:38.543 --> 34:40.645
Silky seems really confident
about hers,

34:40.645 --> 34:42.013
but I don't really care for it
that much.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.349
It kind of just looks like
a big, like, blanket

34:44.349 --> 34:46.351
laying on her.
So we'll see.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.852
-Oh, yeah, I did see that.
-Yeah.

34:47.852 --> 34:49.688
It's not my favorite.
It's not very clean.

34:49.688 --> 34:50.822
But she has such personality.

34:50.822 --> 34:51.823
[Scarlet] Oh, yeah.

34:51.823 --> 34:53.591
Huge personality.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.293
A little overwhelming
sometimes.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.462
Girl, this is bundt,
as in bundt cake, honey.

34:57.462 --> 34:58.964
Bundt cake.

34:58.964 --> 35:00.532
[Nina]
It doesn't seem to turn off.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.667
Silky knows that she's on TV,

35:02.667 --> 35:03.501
and she wants her moment.

35:03.501 --> 35:04.903
Whoo!

35:04.903 --> 35:06.104
But you can only go so far

35:06.104 --> 35:08.306
with just being straight up
like obnoxious.

35:08.306 --> 35:09.374
So we'll see.

35:09.374 --> 35:10.875
[Silky] Ow!

35:10.875 --> 35:13.111
Girl, my hair started melting.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.446
You gotta give everyone
their moment,

35:14.446 --> 35:15.647
you know what I mean?

35:15.647 --> 35:17.315
Yeah, you have to fight for it
with her.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.684
Oh, milk in my kitchen.
Oh, this kitchen's down.

35:24.589 --> 35:27.025
-A'Keria?
-Uh-huh.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.560
A'Keria's the one
with the issue?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.028
What? What happened?

35:30.028 --> 35:31.963
I need to have you just stand up
here to get an audio cue.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.865
-Oh.
-Audio. BJ.

35:33.865 --> 35:36.101
[Miley] Copy.

35:36.101 --> 35:38.403
It's A'Keria's mic,
if you could fix that up.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.604
No problem.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.406
Let's see.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.008
It's down here.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.076
You have to go from the bottom.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.711
-How you doing?
-How you doing?

35:46.711 --> 35:48.580
Hold on, now.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.382
Come here. Come here.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.416
-I took care of it.
-Come here.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.650
Am I done?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.586
Yeah, what's up?

35:54.586 --> 35:56.254
Wait a minute.

35:56.254 --> 35:59.457
[screams]

35:59.457 --> 36:00.725
What up?

36:00.725 --> 36:01.826
-What up?
-What up?

36:01.826 --> 36:04.896
[all scream]

36:07.232 --> 36:09.501
Hannah Montana's in the room?
Are you kidding me?

36:09.501 --> 36:10.702
Oh, my God!

36:10.702 --> 36:12.103
Whoo-hoo!

36:12.103 --> 36:13.905
Miley!

36:13.905 --> 36:15.840
What the hell?
She's my favorite.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.509
Drag Race is crazy.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.910
I can't believe
this is happening right now.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.645
[Silky] Girl, get on my back.

36:20.645 --> 36:25.083
That's the Wrecking Ball!
That's the Wrecking Ball now!

36:25.083 --> 36:26.451
[Soju] I'm freaking out.

36:26.451 --> 36:27.952
I want to go and say hi to her,

36:27.952 --> 36:29.521
but fricking Silky took her.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.357
Boom through you ho's
like a wrecking ball.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.291
I'm about to boom through you
like a wrecking ball.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.260
Aah!

36:35.260 --> 36:36.728
Whoo.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.963
I think she looks scared, girl.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.965
What up, y'all?
What up?

36:40.965 --> 36:42.500
You ain't givin' me trade,
bitch.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.003
[all laugh]

36:45.003 --> 36:46.571
Oh!

36:46.571 --> 36:48.840
-She got that short hair.
-[laughs]

36:48.840 --> 36:51.042
I'm excited for whoever
the judge is this week, though.

36:52.510 --> 36:53.912
[cheering]

36:53.912 --> 36:55.313
[Miley] I'm freaking out.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.649
I can't believe I'm here
in this double mirror shit.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.850
I wanna write something.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.086
Yes! Yes!

37:01.086 --> 37:02.454
So what's everyone's vibe
tonight?

37:02.454 --> 37:04.055
Does everyone feel
like comfortable?

37:04.055 --> 37:05.757
We're all little nervous wrecks.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.425
You know what?
When I'm nervous,

37:07.425 --> 37:09.661
I know it sounds cheesy,
but seriously, breathe.

37:09.661 --> 37:12.097
You hold one side, and you
breathe through one side,

37:12.097 --> 37:13.264
and you exhale
through the other.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.667
Because
if you're not breathing,

37:15.667 --> 37:18.169
you get into this panic state,
and then you're not yourself.

37:18.169 --> 37:21.106
My godmother is Dolly Parton,
and, you know,

37:21.106 --> 37:22.273
something that
I've learned from Dolly

37:22.273 --> 37:23.808
and the reason why
people love her so much

37:23.808 --> 37:25.610
is she's always herself,
you know.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.846
What you want to be is like
beautiful, and I know this.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.714
But for me, a fan at home,

37:29.714 --> 37:31.716
I fall in love
with the personality

37:31.716 --> 37:33.284
and what Ru has done,

37:33.284 --> 37:34.619
you do that
through your personality.

37:34.619 --> 37:37.055
You all wouldn't be here
if you weren't confident.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.857
You're not too scared to try.

37:38.857 --> 37:41.993
So that already makes you
badass and a winner

37:41.993 --> 37:42.994
because you're trying, you know.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.963
So preach.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.732
So I'm gonna go de-drag
and then re-drag.

37:47.732 --> 37:48.967
Yes.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.101
But I'll see y'all later.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.536
And I can't wait
for you to see my look.

37:51.536 --> 37:52.704
[cheers and applause]

37:52.704 --> 37:54.105
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.941
Everyone wants to be here,
including me, so...

37:56.941 --> 37:58.877
[Silky] Don't you leave
without hugging me, honey.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.278
-I won't.
-I discovered you.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.314
-You did discover me.
-I discovered you.

38:03.314 --> 38:04.516
I can credit you and my mom
for everything.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.551
So when you gonna
discover me, bitch?

38:06.551 --> 38:07.519
[Miley] I'm ready.
You better bring it tonight.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.521
I know you will.
I already know.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.557
It's really shocking
to be this close to Miley.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.559
And it's really humbling,
actually,

38:14.559 --> 38:18.396
because she seems genuinely
as excited about meeting us

38:18.396 --> 38:20.732
and getting to be
a part of this experience

38:20.732 --> 38:21.866
as we are to see her.

38:21.866 --> 38:23.301
Have a great show.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.369
[Nina] We will.

38:24.369 --> 38:25.370
-See y'all.
-Thank you.

44:37.308 --> 44:39.076
my job is to strut my ass
down the runway

44:39.076 --> 44:41.312
and give it some shoulder
and a wink or two

44:41.312 --> 44:42.947

-Hi, Plastique.
-Hi, Miley.

46:02.994 --> 46:05.429
Well, I kind of got a glimpse
at your dress before,

46:05.429 --> 46:07.898
and I loved it
since I was in the workroom.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.368
There's a level of class
that I really, really loved.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.203
Have you worn this kind
of silhouette before?

46:12.203 --> 46:13.971
It's kind of like my go-to.

46:13.971 --> 46:15.706
Cinch in the middle,
and then something flowing.

46:15.706 --> 46:18.209
It looks so well done, even
though it came out of a box.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.811
And I'm going to remember you
when I go to bed tonight.

46:20.811 --> 46:22.880
[all laugh]

46:22.880 --> 46:25.082
Up next, the BK, y'all,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

46:25.082 --> 46:26.217
Hi.

46:26.217 --> 46:28.219
You know what that is?

46:28.219 --> 46:29.754
-Mic drop?
-That is a mic drop, bitch,

46:29.754 --> 46:32.056
'cause you turned it out
tonight.

46:32.056 --> 46:33.257
Thank you.

46:33.257 --> 46:34.759
Did you sew this whole
bodysuit situation?

46:34.759 --> 46:37.028
-Mm-hmm, I did.
-Well, this was fantastic.

46:37.028 --> 46:39.163
You owned the stage.

46:39.163 --> 46:42.066
I love it when a queen just
like grabs my reins, right?

46:42.066 --> 46:44.568
-Ooh. Okay.
-Yeah, and this says,

46:44.568 --> 46:47.004
bitch, you're gonna watch me
while I'm up here for a minute.

46:47.004 --> 46:50.107
This is exactly what we were
talking about in the workroom.

46:50.107 --> 46:52.710
No matter what you're looking
like, it's always there.

46:52.710 --> 46:53.911
It's that star power.

46:53.911 --> 46:55.613
Thank you for that talk
about nerves, earlier.

46:55.613 --> 46:57.982
-About nerves.
-About nerves.

46:57.982 --> 46:59.283
I was a little nervous,

46:59.283 --> 47:01.185
and then I took a big breath
before I came on stage.

47:01.185 --> 47:03.154
-Good.
-Thank you.

47:03.154 --> 47:06.323
Next up, A'Keria C. Davenport.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.592
The necklace is huge.
The earrings are huge.

47:08.592 --> 47:11.862
The headpiece, it's a lot,
but I don't know,

47:11.862 --> 47:13.931
I got excited when you
walked around that corner.

47:13.931 --> 47:16.801
I'm a firm believer that we can
build a career on too much.

47:16.801 --> 47:18.135
I've done it.

47:18.135 --> 47:20.304
There's some other people here
that have done it.

47:20.304 --> 47:22.039
-Don't ask.
-Ru.

47:22.039 --> 47:25.576
And I love the fact
that you wore all that hair.

47:25.576 --> 47:27.745
You didn't just do two wigs.

47:27.745 --> 47:30.481
You didn't do
just three wigs, girl.

47:30.481 --> 47:33.284
You did five wigs,
and I'm loving it.

47:33.284 --> 47:35.286
Thank you.

47:35.286 --> 47:36.887
Next up, Soju.

47:36.887 --> 47:40.891
Why, exactly, did we go
for like a bell silhouette?

47:40.891 --> 47:43.928
Um, it's a traditional
Korean silhouette.

47:43.928 --> 47:45.129
Okay, that's lovely.

47:45.129 --> 47:46.797
But the tulle is hitting
at different lengths.

47:46.797 --> 47:48.566
There's giant knots
in the back.

47:48.566 --> 47:51.469
It literally
doesn't tell us a story.

47:51.469 --> 47:54.772
This is tough, because
you get one chance

47:54.772 --> 47:57.041
to show all of us
something that intrigues.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.577
And I don't know that
you did that with this look.

47:59.577 --> 48:01.412
It's been a rough journey
getting here.

48:01.412 --> 48:05.616
I got diagnosed with tendonitis
and I have a cyst.

48:05.616 --> 48:08.018
I'm currently oozing.

48:08.018 --> 48:10.287
Oh.

48:10.287 --> 48:11.956
And then it popped
in the plane ride here.

48:11.956 --> 48:14.425
So it's just been a messy week.

48:16.627 --> 48:18.629
[laughs]

48:18.629 --> 48:21.532
I'm so sorry
that I over-shared.

48:21.532 --> 48:22.466
But can I tell you something?

48:22.466 --> 48:24.602
I kind of know who you are now.

48:24.602 --> 48:26.804
You're like a weird over-sharer,
and I like that.

48:26.804 --> 48:28.439
It's my favorite thing
you've done so far.

48:28.439 --> 48:30.741
So tell me more about that cyst.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.676
[all laugh]

48:32.676 --> 48:36.647
Up next,
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

48:36.647 --> 48:38.749
I think you need to watch
your makeup a little bit.

48:38.749 --> 48:41.852
Your white contrasts
with brown tones,

48:41.852 --> 48:43.220
and what we're seeing
is almost a mask

48:43.220 --> 48:44.155
on the top part of your face.

48:44.155 --> 48:45.723
Okay.

48:45.723 --> 48:47.224
There's something kind of fun
about this outfit.

48:47.224 --> 48:49.827
You kind of look like a very
slutty worker at Sea World.

48:49.827 --> 48:51.495
-Ooh, I like that.
-You know?

48:51.495 --> 48:54.031
[Carson] The problem
is the way you presented it.

48:54.031 --> 48:55.499
You did look a little timid.

48:55.499 --> 48:58.803
The look isn't strong enough
on its own, unfortunately.

48:58.803 --> 49:00.137
-It's just OTR.
-Yeah.

49:00.137 --> 49:02.339
-What's OTR stand for?
-Off the rack, girl.

49:02.339 --> 49:07.878
Up next, returning girl
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

49:07.878 --> 49:09.513
Vanjie, you are
the perfect example

49:09.513 --> 49:13.017
of why week one is so important

49:13.017 --> 49:16.020
that you have to show us
who you are on the runway.

49:16.020 --> 49:17.888
Because last year, you didn't.

49:17.888 --> 49:21.025
If this is who Vanjie is,
well, good start.

49:21.025 --> 49:23.227
You seem a little nervous.
Are you nervous?

49:23.227 --> 49:24.662
No, just anxious.

49:24.662 --> 49:26.397
Because last time
I thought I looked cute, too,

49:26.397 --> 49:27.531
until I saw the footage.

49:27.531 --> 49:29.333
[all laugh]

49:29.333 --> 49:33.204
You have a lot of personality
that just oozes out of you,

49:33.204 --> 49:34.238
in a different way from Soju.

49:34.238 --> 49:36.273
[all laugh]

49:36.273 --> 49:39.743
You just feel like someone you
want to get to know as a person,

49:39.743 --> 49:41.245
and not just a drag queen

49:41.245 --> 49:42.613
that you want to see what
they're gonna wear next week.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.248
I don't really care.

49:44.248 --> 49:45.716
I want to know what
you're gonna say next week,

49:45.716 --> 49:47.151
and that's who a star is.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.185
Thank you.

49:48.185 --> 49:50.387
[RuPaul] Up next, Nina West.

49:50.387 --> 49:51.922
Been a long time coming.

49:51.922 --> 49:54.191
I've seen a lot
of audition reels from you.

49:54.191 --> 49:55.326
Nine years.

49:55.326 --> 49:56.360
Nine years?

49:56.360 --> 49:58.329
Nine. Yeah.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.364
Nina, what are on your feet?

50:02.066 --> 50:04.735
And the--
what's on the dress?

50:04.735 --> 50:07.738
I know. I'm not delusional
about what I'm wearing.

50:07.738 --> 50:09.840
When Ru walked into
the workroom yesterday,

50:09.840 --> 50:11.675
I was just gobsmacked.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.245
I was--when I was a kid,

50:14.245 --> 50:17.948
I remember purchasing
the maxi single of Super Model--

50:17.948 --> 50:19.783
Hold on a minute, now.

50:19.783 --> 50:22.653
[all laugh]
-Hold up, honey.

50:22.653 --> 50:25.189
But to stand here
and have a full circle moment

50:25.189 --> 50:30.394
and to feel like I have
possibly fucked it up,

50:30.394 --> 50:32.630
that's heartbreaking to me.

50:32.630 --> 50:34.798
Maybe this dress isn't so great.

50:34.798 --> 50:37.434
The good thing is
is you have a great personality,

50:37.434 --> 50:39.670
great stage presence.

50:39.670 --> 50:41.105
So get out of your head,
because you have what it takes.

50:41.105 --> 50:42.740
I'm gonna give it to you,
I promise.

50:42.740 --> 50:43.741
[Michelle] Good.

50:43.741 --> 50:46.176
Up next, Kahanna Montrese.

50:46.176 --> 50:49.346
[Michelle]
This was so uncohesive for me.

50:49.346 --> 50:50.948
And what really threw me off

50:50.948 --> 50:55.519
was the stoning of your tights
stopped at the top of the leg.

50:55.519 --> 50:56.887
If you're going to stone
the tights,

50:56.887 --> 50:58.522
we need the stoning
to go all the way up.

50:58.522 --> 51:00.557
How would you describe
your drag?

51:00.557 --> 51:03.827
Oh, very--this is not a good
representation of my drag.

51:03.827 --> 51:06.196
It's very, like,
a hip-hop showgirl.

51:06.196 --> 51:08.365
But also very elegant.

51:08.365 --> 51:11.602
I got lost because I was trying
to combine my drag with Katya's.

51:11.602 --> 51:13.337
Well, but the challenge was

51:13.337 --> 51:18.542
for you to interpret your style
using Katya's materials.

51:18.542 --> 51:20.878
Um, to be honest,

51:20.878 --> 51:24.048
it's hard when you've got
a Drag Race mother.

51:24.048 --> 51:26.583
It's just
that expectation behind it,

51:26.583 --> 51:30.688
and I've kind of been fighting
that my whole career, you know.

51:30.688 --> 51:33.924
I just want to be able
to show who I am.

51:33.924 --> 51:37.227
But in this business, you don't
get many second chances.

51:37.227 --> 51:40.965
You've got to know who you are
and deliver that at all times.

51:40.965 --> 51:42.700
Yes, ma'am.

51:42.700 --> 51:44.435
[RuPaul] Thank you, ladies.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.737
While you untuck backstage,

51:46.737 --> 51:48.706
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:50.441 --> 51:53.110
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

51:53.110 --> 51:54.311
what do you think?

51:54.311 --> 51:57.348
We'll start with
Plastique Tiara.

51:57.348 --> 51:59.416
I think that she's a real pro.

51:59.416 --> 52:01.285
She knows how to create a great
look that flatters her body.

52:01.285 --> 52:04.688
The con would be
she was playing it safe.

52:04.688 --> 52:07.725
She gave us the pretty girl, but
I wonder if she can get gritty.

52:07.725 --> 52:10.728
Let's move on down
to Brooke Lynn Hytes.

52:10.728 --> 52:14.498
[Miley] I love that it really
represented the challenge,

52:14.498 --> 52:16.433
because I don't think we can
say that for all of the girls.

52:16.433 --> 52:18.502
Brooke Lynn
could have worn Nina's dress

52:18.502 --> 52:21.071
and still be in the top,

52:21.071 --> 52:24.742
because she had such confidence
and star power.

52:24.742 --> 52:27.144
[RuPaul] A'Keria.
I loved the chaps.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.146
I wear them
probably way too often.

52:29.146 --> 52:32.449
And A'Keria for me took a risk,

52:32.449 --> 52:35.853
because that big exaggerated
horse's mane sort of thing

52:35.853 --> 52:38.789
that could be a yay or a neigh.

52:38.789 --> 52:40.624
But it made me think

52:40.624 --> 52:42.659
that there's more to her
than just a show pony.

52:42.659 --> 52:43.727
You know, like--

52:43.727 --> 52:45.562
[all laugh]

52:45.562 --> 52:47.931
And the hits
just keep on coming.

52:47.931 --> 52:49.333
Save a horse, ride a drag queen?

52:49.333 --> 52:50.334
Yeah.

52:50.334 --> 52:51.602
-Does that work?
-Sure.

52:51.602 --> 52:54.304
[RuPaul]
Let's move on to Soju.

52:54.304 --> 52:56.607
First of all, I'm not sure if
she was wearing flats or not.

52:56.607 --> 52:58.409
[RuPaul]
She was wearing flats.

52:58.409 --> 53:00.778
I mean, maybe the aesthetic
of that dress could have changed

53:00.778 --> 53:02.913
if she had a nice heel on.

53:02.913 --> 53:06.316
Ross Mathews, I know
you're obsessed with her cyst.

53:06.316 --> 53:07.484
He's ob-cyst.

53:07.484 --> 53:10.254
I'm ob-cyst.
That's my cyster up there.

53:10.254 --> 53:11.455
[all laugh]
Oh.

53:11.455 --> 53:12.689
Now, she was wearing flats

53:12.689 --> 53:14.458
because she didn't want to slip.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.326
Oh, my God.

53:16.326 --> 53:18.162
I feel in love with her
when she opened her mouth.

53:18.162 --> 53:20.531
There's a deep well
of kind of weird there.

53:20.531 --> 53:23.534
But that outfit
was undeniably a mess.

53:23.534 --> 53:26.804
[RuPaul] Mercedes Iman Diamond.

53:26.804 --> 53:27.905
A Maybach, she ain't.

53:27.905 --> 53:29.173
Ooh. [laughs]

53:29.173 --> 53:30.808
No, more of like
a certified preowned Chevy.

53:30.808 --> 53:32.543
Not a bad car.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.844
[Michelle] You know how I feel
about a bodysuit.

53:33.844 --> 53:36.046
It's just so unimaginative.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.515
And she kept looking down.

53:38.515 --> 53:40.651
I wasn't connecting
with any kind of personality.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.152
She seemed overwhelmed, maybe,

53:42.152 --> 53:44.488
intimidated by the crowd
that she was in.

53:44.488 --> 53:47.057
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.193
Vanjie looked good tonight.

53:49.193 --> 53:50.828
I mean, we saw her
one time last year,

53:50.828 --> 53:51.728
and her proportions
were so off.

53:51.728 --> 53:53.330
Do you remember,

53:53.330 --> 53:54.298
she was like a squished
little ball of flowers.

53:54.298 --> 53:56.300
She was elongated tonight.

53:56.300 --> 53:58.302
With that deep V,
she was cinched.

53:58.302 --> 54:00.270
I just thought, okay,
this is somebody

54:00.270 --> 54:01.939
who has finally gotten it.

54:01.939 --> 54:03.540
I thought it was
one of the best of the night.

54:03.540 --> 54:05.876
I think she met the criteria
of the challenge really well.

54:05.876 --> 54:08.178
I love Vanjie.
Such a huge fan.

54:08.178 --> 54:09.513
You're a Fanjie.

54:09.513 --> 54:12.049
I'm a Fanjie. Fanjie.

54:12.049 --> 54:13.550
[laughs]

54:13.550 --> 54:15.119
Nina West.

54:15.119 --> 54:16.987
Even though that dress looked
like a rare blood disease...

54:16.987 --> 54:18.489
[Michelle laughs]

54:18.489 --> 54:22.459
We got distracted by her
personality, by her sincerity.

54:22.459 --> 54:24.761
[Ross] She's tried nine times
to be here.

54:24.761 --> 54:28.499
It's just such a shame that
that is what she put together.

54:28.499 --> 54:30.968
But it would just be
so anticlimactic

54:30.968 --> 54:32.936
to have her go home right now.

54:32.936 --> 54:34.738
It'd be un-American, actually.

54:34.738 --> 54:36.206
You know, it'd be wrong.

54:36.206 --> 54:37.541
It'd be like Trump
being president.

54:37.541 --> 54:39.510
-Yeah.
-It'd just be so fucked up.

54:39.510 --> 54:41.378
[RuPaul] Kahanna Montrese.

54:41.378 --> 54:43.814
This look tonight by far
was my least favorite.

54:43.814 --> 54:45.382
Really? More than Soju?

54:45.382 --> 54:48.051
Yeah. At least--it's two colors
of tulle and a floral.

54:48.051 --> 54:49.920
That made no sense.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.288
That didn't bug me as much

54:51.288 --> 54:53.457
as when I asked her
to describe her drag.

54:53.457 --> 54:55.192
Yeah, she said
a hip-hop showgirl,

54:55.192 --> 54:58.428
but kind of then went,
but I'm really classy.

54:58.428 --> 55:01.265
I don't know about that
with your titty hanging out.

55:01.265 --> 55:02.366
[laughs]

55:02.366 --> 55:05.135
Silence.
I've made my decision.

55:05.135 --> 55:07.304
Bring back my girls.

55:07.304 --> 55:09.139
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

55:31.795 --> 55:33.363
This week
you hit the heights.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.233

55:36.233 --> 55:38.535
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

Thank you.

weren't landing.

56:23.547 --> 56:26.617
Mercedes Iman Diamond,

56:26.617 --> 56:30.354
on the runway,
you ran out of gas.

56:30.354 --> 56:35.192
Kahanna Montrese, tonight
you are a one-armed bandit,

56:35.192 --> 56:38.028
but you did not hit the jackpot.

56:40.964 --> 56:42.432
Mercedes.

56:44.601 --> 56:46.203
You're safe.

Kahanna Montrese, Soju,

56:57.748 --> 57:00.217
I'm sorry, but you are up
for elimination.

57:02.886 --> 57:05.922
Two queens stand before me.

57:05.922 --> 57:07.324
Prior to tonight,

57:07.324 --> 57:10.494
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

57:10.494 --> 57:14.931
of The Best of Both Worlds
by Hannah Montana.

57:14.931 --> 57:16.700
Hey, whatever happened to her?

57:16.700 --> 57:18.101
A lot of drugs.

57:18.101 --> 57:20.437

57:22.072 --> 57:23.740

57:23.740 --> 57:28.312
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:28.312 --> 57:31.948
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:34.484 --> 57:36.586
The time has come...
[thunder]

57:36.586 --> 57:38.989
for you to lip sync...

57:38.989 --> 57:43.160

57:43.160 --> 57:46.129
So I'm in the bottom two,
and I'm going through it.

57:46.129 --> 57:49.099
But I pick myself up, because
this is my moment to shine.

57:49.099 --> 57:52.302
Best believe the judges
are gonna see exactly who I am.

57:52.302 --> 57:55.739
I'm going to fight.
I can't go home right now.

57:55.739 --> 58:00.243
I...

58:00.243 --> 58:01.645
I don't wanna go home.
