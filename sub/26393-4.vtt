00:03.568 --> 00:05.744
Dave, slow down.

00:05.788 --> 00:08.051
I'’m just excited.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.662
I know, but you'’re running like
you'’re about to miss a flight.

00:10.706 --> 00:13.361
Ooh, I have never missed
a flight and I never will.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.973
You are weirdly
arrogant about that.

00:21.499 --> 00:22.805
Hey, Calvin.

00:22.848 --> 00:26.069
Hey, Dave. Gemma.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.071
We just wanted to swing by
and drop off one of these.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.552
What'’s this?

00:30.595 --> 00:32.684
It'’s an invitation to
our housewarming party.

00:32.728 --> 00:33.946
Yeah, it'’s gonna be awesome.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.470
I can see,
it says it right here.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.559
"It'’s gonna be awesome."

00:37.602 --> 00:40.127
Yeah, well, uh, it'’s in all caps
so you know it'’s true.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.347
We thought a party
would be a great way

00:43.391 --> 00:44.914
to get to know some
of our new neighbors.

00:44.957 --> 00:45.958
Yeah, become a part
of the community,

00:46.002 --> 00:47.699
but in an awesome way.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.571
Yeah, that'’s great.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.964
Too bad I can'’t make it.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.792
Well, you haven'’t even looked
at when it is.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.752
Eh. Yep, I can'’t make it.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.884
Why not?

00:58.928 --> 01:01.931
Well, you know, the first
Saturday of every month

01:01.974 --> 01:04.412
is, uh, dart night down
at Ernie'’s Hot Spot.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.240
Can'’t you just skip it
this one time?

01:06.283 --> 01:08.024
Yeah. It'’s gonna be
a great party.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.200
Gemma, tell him what they used
to call me back in Michigan.

01:10.244 --> 01:13.160
The Party King
of Kalamazoo.
The...

01:13.203 --> 01:16.380
Okay. I didn'’t know I was
in the presence of royalty.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.208
Will you tell Tina
and the boys?

01:18.252 --> 01:19.427
Sure.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.124
Hey, uh, Calvin.

01:21.168 --> 01:24.345
Don'’t go down to the bar
and throw darts.

01:24.388 --> 01:28.044
Come to the party
and... and throw down.

I want to stay
for the party.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.887
Oh, baby,
you wouldn'’t like it.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.671
It'’s just gonna be a bunch
of boring grown-ups

01:46.715 --> 01:48.978
talking about boring
grown-up stuff.

the beer pong table?

Why are you bringing
that in here?

01:54.679 --> 01:56.159
Well, it'’s a party,
it'’s supposed to be fun.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.335
I know, but it'’s
a housewarming,

you kicked off campus.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.730
Okay.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.340
That was not my fault.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.255
They told me those goats
were trained.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.214
Sweetie, relax.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.216
This is just gonna be
a tasteful evening

02:09.259 --> 02:11.261
of getting to know
our new neighbors.

Ugh. But that'’s boring

You'’re right, Mom.
I'’ll skip this one.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.964
Why are you changing
the plan all of a sudden?

02:19.008 --> 02:21.271
Is this because of Calvin?Calvin?

02:21.315 --> 02:23.317
I didn'’t say anything about
Calvin. You said Calvin.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.014
If anyone'’s obsessed
with Calvin, it'’s you.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.192
He told us he
already has plans.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.411
I know.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.369
To play darts.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.285
It'’s like he thinks
our party'’s gonna be lame.

02:35.329 --> 02:38.723
Why would he think that,
Party King of Kalamazoo?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.337
I don'’t get it. Every time
I try to be his friend

02:43.380 --> 02:45.556
he throws it back in my face.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.992
You know,
we'’re next-door neighbors.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.994
We are supposed to get along.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.562
Well, instead of throwing
this party for the neighbors

02:51.606 --> 02:53.782
who don'’t want to come, maybe
you should be throwing it

02:53.825 --> 02:55.958
for the neighbors who do.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.961
I am.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.441
I just hope they tell Calvin
about it.

03:03.922 --> 03:07.317
Oh, man, I can'’t believe you're
really not coming to this party.

03:07.361 --> 03:08.884
And I can'’t believe
that you want me to miss

03:08.927 --> 03:10.668
dart night at Ernie'’s.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.627
It'’s a beautiful tradition.

03:12.670 --> 03:15.151
The only reason you like going
is to hustle people at darts.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.326
It'’s a beautiful tradition.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.895
Well, I'’m looking
forward to the party.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.723
Ooh. I bet they'’re gonna
have a signature cocktail

03:21.766 --> 03:24.856
with a clever name like,
like, "Gemma and Juice."

03:24.900 --> 03:27.250

03:27.294 --> 03:30.775
uh, "Fuzzy Davel." Yeah?[laughs]

03:30.819 --> 03:33.213
Ah, baby, why don'’t you make
an exception this one time?

03:33.256 --> 03:35.693
Hey, look, I'’ll two-step
with you.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.347
To what? Taylor Swift?

03:38.957 --> 03:41.569
So that'’s what it is.

03:41.612 --> 03:42.657
You don'’t want to go
'’cause this is gonna

03:42.700 --> 03:43.875
be a white people party.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.312
No, I don'’t want to go

03:45.355 --> 03:47.705
because I don'’t want
Dave using me

03:47.749 --> 03:49.446
like he'’s using all of y'all
to legitimize

03:49.490 --> 03:50.839
his lame-ass party.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.234
Come on, Pop. He'’s not using us.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.713
Y'’all don't get it.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.628
See, the Johnsons
are like the pilgrims.

03:57.672 --> 04:01.502
Uh, uh, no, hang on.[all groaning]

04:01.545 --> 04:06.376
Look, they need the natives,
i.e. us,

04:06.420 --> 04:08.378
to navigate through
the cold winter,

04:08.422 --> 04:10.728
i.e. their corny-ass party.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.341
They think
that they can

04:14.384 --> 04:16.778
come onto our land,
plant their flag

04:16.821 --> 04:19.346
and then claim this neighborhood
as their own.

is about, okay?

04:36.798 --> 04:39.888

09:46.107 --> 09:48.718
Not enough.
[laughs]

09:48.762 --> 09:50.633
This is amazing. I can'’t believe
how many people are here.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.592
Oh, I can.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.550
We'’re the Butlers.
That'’s how we do.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.552
Boom!

09:56.596 --> 09:58.032
Drink up, sucka.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.038
Come on, man. If you don'’t
get your head in the game,

10:04.081 --> 10:06.910
Miss Kim is gonna start
looking like that. Let'’s go!

10:06.954 --> 10:08.608
[claps hands]Sweetie?

10:08.651 --> 10:10.653
I'’m-I'm sorry,
don'’t you mean Party King?

10:10.697 --> 10:11.785
Hit me, Marty!

10:11.828 --> 10:14.570
[air horn sound effect]

10:14.614 --> 10:16.920
[laughs softly]
Don'’t you think this party's

10:16.964 --> 10:18.705
getting a little out of hand?

10:18.748 --> 10:20.663
I think you'’ve proven
your point to Calvin.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.447
Oh, this isn'’t about Calvin.
It'’s like you said.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.145
This is about meeting
our neighbors.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.321
And I'’ve already met
some really great ones.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.539
Who?

10:27.583 --> 10:29.672
Well, Craig, Dante,
Lil'’ Hatchet.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.631
"Lil'’ Hatchet"?

10:31.674 --> 10:33.633
I know.

10:33.676 --> 10:37.549
The name is kind of scary,
but trust me, she'’s really nice.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.990
In the time you'’ve
been nursing that drink,

10:43.033 --> 10:44.948
I could'’ve gotten
five phone numbers.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.036
With your old ass,

10:46.080 --> 10:47.647
one of '’em better be Life Alert.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.259
You see what'’s happening here,
right?

10:51.302 --> 10:53.478
Our community
is being chipped away.

10:53.522 --> 10:54.479
Oh, boy.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.611
No, no, no, no.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.612
Now, come on now.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.396
Marvin'’s Barbecue is now

10:58.440 --> 10:59.397
a coffee shop.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.877
Norm'’s Hardware

11:00.921 --> 11:02.923
is a juice bar.All right.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.317
And Sondra'’s Beauty Parlor
is a marijuana dispensary.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.058
She always sold weed.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.017
It'’s just legal now.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.758
That is true.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.324
[chuckles]

11:13.368 --> 11:14.848
Well, no matter how much
this neighborhood changes,

11:14.891 --> 11:16.371
my auto shop

11:16.414 --> 11:18.242
and this fine
drinking establishment

11:18.286 --> 11:19.679
will always be here.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.115
Yeah.Yeah.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.377
Yeah, yeah.To you and me, man.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.553
The last of the Mohicans.

11:24.596 --> 11:27.208
[chuckles]

11:30.298 --> 11:31.995
Why you not raising your beer?

11:32.039 --> 11:34.171
Look, Calvin,
I ain'’t gonna lie to you.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.347
I'’ve been getting a lot of calls

11:36.391 --> 11:38.045
from people wanting
to buy this place.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.046
What?

11:39.089 --> 11:40.177
How much?

11:40.221 --> 11:42.223
Enough to retire to Méjico.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.486
Which is Spanish
for "I'’m rich there!"

11:45.835 --> 11:47.924
Come on, man.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.187
Think about all the memories
we had.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.972
You know,

11:52.015 --> 11:53.321
it was in that booth right there

11:53.364 --> 11:55.366
that you met your wife.[chuckles] Yeah.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.195
And then that booth right there
where you proposed to her.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.631
And then that booth

11:59.675 --> 12:00.894
where she caught you cheating.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.156
Yeah.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.158
Those were good times.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.899
Exactly.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.639
That'’s why you can't sell
this place.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.076
[sighs]
What can I say?

12:09.119 --> 12:10.860
I love the neighborhood.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.776
PeroI love Cancún más.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.473
Fine.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.866
You want to go
to the party?

12:16.910 --> 12:19.303
Go ahead. Be a sellout.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.653
Hey, hey, hold up, hold up!
You forgot to pay your tab.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.220
No, I didn'’t.

that card stolen.

been trying to talk to you,[chuckles]

12:36.843 --> 12:38.888

your girlfriend over there.

12:38.932 --> 12:39.933
[both chuckle]

12:45.982 --> 12:49.420
You know, she used
to change my diaper.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.726
Now she wants me
to get in hers.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.514
Oh, so this is your party.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.038
Chris forwarded me the invite.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.822
Your house is so nice.

You know, actually, I-I...It'’s so cool to meet a guy

who doesn'’t live with
his parents for once.

Hey, Malcolm,
this is amazing.

into a VIP lounge.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.142
Does he live here, too?

13:15.185 --> 13:16.970
Yes. Every crew'’s got
to have a white guy

13:17.013 --> 13:18.232
that they can do this to.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.973
Hey, yo, Dave!

No, it needs to be over now.Mm.

wearing my wedding dress.

seem happy.

Do I hide the booze and
tell everyone we ran out?

15:18.134 --> 15:20.528
You know that burned-down house
on the corner of 22nd?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.356
Yeah, they hid the booze, too.

The truth comes out.

18:11.873 --> 18:12.917
We'’re the first white people
to move here,

18:12.961 --> 18:14.484

neighborhood was white.

moved in,

18:35.853 --> 18:39.161

"There goes the neighborhood."

And soon,

18:41.772 --> 18:43.339
all of the white people
moved away,

18:43.383 --> 18:46.168
because they didn'’t want to live
next to black people.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.822
Okay, but that'’s not me.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.606
I want to live here.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.392
Sure, now you do.

18:52.435 --> 18:55.177
See, but when y'’all left,
the community suffered,

18:55.221 --> 18:58.659
and-and we,
we worked hard to restore it.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.356
And now, you want to come back

19:00.400 --> 19:02.228
into our neighborhood
and reclaim it as your own.

19:02.271 --> 19:05.579
Okay, I am not-I am not
trying to reclaim anything.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.451
And I'’m sorry that your family
had to go through that.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.195
It is wrong to make anyone
feel unwelcome

19:13.239 --> 19:15.458
in their own neighborhood.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.243
But isn'’t that kind of
what you'’re doing to me?

19:19.680 --> 19:20.594
[air horn sound effect]

19:22.291 --> 19:23.640
Oops. Uh, that'’s my bad.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.294
My finger slipped.
[chuckles]

19:25.338 --> 19:26.469
All right, that'’s it.

19:26.513 --> 19:30.169
Everybody, out.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.735
Oh, is this
where the party'’s at?

19:31.779 --> 19:33.259
I saw the balloons.

19:33.302 --> 19:36.000
Ooh, crudité. Mm.

19:44.966 --> 19:48.230
Oh, hey, Gemma, good news.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.450
I found your veil.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.803
What are you doing here?

19:55.846 --> 19:57.587
Oh, nothing.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.721
Look, uh, just thought about
what you said earlier,

20:00.764 --> 20:03.898
and, uh, brought you this.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.598
Trash bags?

20:08.642 --> 20:12.123
I mean, big party,
you know, big mess.

20:14.822 --> 20:18.434
It was kind of a big party,
wasn'’t it?

20:18.478 --> 20:20.610
I mean, I wouldn'’t call you
the Party King of Pasadena,

20:20.654 --> 20:23.178
but it was a'’ight.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.180
Well, thank you.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.748
You'’re welcome.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.750
You hear what I said?

20:29.793 --> 20:31.404
I said you'’re welcome.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.841
Yeah, I heard you.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.451
I don'’t think you did.

20:35.495 --> 20:38.933
You are welcome.

20:38.976 --> 20:41.109
O-kay.

20:44.895 --> 20:48.334
Ah, hell, I tried.
[mumbles]

20:48.377 --> 20:50.336
Why do you keep saying
"You'’re welcome..."

20:50.379 --> 20:52.642
I get it.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.383
I'’m welcome, like, like,
in the neighborhood.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.603
Too late!
I changed my mind.
