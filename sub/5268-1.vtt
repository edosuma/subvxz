00:36.236 --> 00:38.534
Interior to command.

00:38.571 --> 00:42.905
We've finished our sweep and we've got
one victim outside being treated by EMS.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.768
Do you got anyone else
in there?

01:23.016 --> 01:27.544
What a shame, huh? It was one
of the oldest buildings in Georgia.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.452
Ronnie, promise me
you'll make an effort, OK?

01:37.497 --> 01:40.159
- Does Dad know she was arrested?
- Jonah!

01:40.199 --> 01:42.633
I didn't do it, OK?
Stay out of it.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.828
Just in time.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.412
Wow!

02:01.321 --> 02:03.585
- Dad!
- Hi, Joe-boy. How are you, man?

02:03.656 --> 02:05.681
I'm great. How are you?

02:05.725 --> 02:07.716
Here we go!

02:09.062 --> 02:11.724
- I missed you. Look how big you are.
- Me too.

02:11.764 --> 02:14.392
You're like six-three now.

02:14.901 --> 02:17.836
- You live on the beach?
- You bet.

02:17.870 --> 02:20.202
That is awesome!

02:20.239 --> 02:23.174
- Don't go in the water.
- Be carefuI if you go in the water.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.474
- How are you?
- I'm good.

02:32.151 --> 02:34.119
That's right, we have two children.

02:34.187 --> 02:37.714
Hi, Ronnie. How are you, sweetheart?

02:44.230 --> 02:45.254
Wow.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.027
You have no idea.

03:35.581 --> 03:38.448
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Strawberry shake.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.122
Here you go.

03:51.364 --> 03:52.490
That's you, Will!

03:58.304 --> 04:00.135
I'm sorry.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.644
- You OK?
- I would rather drink my milkshake...

04:08.681 --> 04:11.650
- than wear it, but I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.013
You look it.

04:15.087 --> 04:16.815
Forget it.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.188
Hey, look. I really am sorry.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.161
- Didn't we just do this?
- I'm Will, by the way.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.495
- Let me buy you another shirt.
- No, thanks. I'm good.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.557
Come on. I'm practicing
Southern hospitality.

04:28.634 --> 04:31.102
Is that what they call
hitting on strangers now?

04:31.170 --> 04:34.435
You know what? I have no interest
in buying you a shirt.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.532
- Is that so?
- I'm just over here...

04:36.576 --> 04:38.476
so the other team can catch a breath.

04:40.847 --> 04:44.510
- Pushy and conceited.
- Why don't you come watch.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.046
I'll pass.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.715
Thank you.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.026
I'm glad you were able to fix it.

05:00.066 --> 05:04.230
Yeah. Ronnie did a pretty good job
with that.

05:04.270 --> 05:09.037
Now I know what a piano looks like when
somebody takes a baseball bat to it.

05:10.176 --> 05:14.613
- You rehearsed that so many times.
- Is she still not playing?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.807
Not since the day you left.

05:16.883 --> 05:20.011
Brian even bought her an electric piano.
She won't go near it.

05:20.052 --> 05:23.078
- An electric piano from Brian?
- Steve.

05:23.723 --> 05:27.887
- How is she otherwise?
- Well, let's see.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.656
Grades were in the toilet.

05:29.729 --> 05:32.095
It's a miracle she graduated
from high schooI.

05:32.131 --> 05:36.227
And she doesn't have one friend
without a pierced something.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.329
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.771
She told you she got
into Juilliard, right?

05:41.841 --> 05:44.708
No. Without playing?

05:44.744 --> 05:47.941
They said they've been
watching her since she was five.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.482
Not that it matters.
She says she's not going.

05:50.550 --> 05:54.350
Well, she'll make the right decision.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.549
I'm glad you're so sure.

06:00.893 --> 06:04.158
- Kim...
- We hurt them, Steve.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.562
Especially Ronnie.

06:06.599 --> 06:10.558
- We can try and pretend...
- I'm not gonna do this. OK?

06:10.603 --> 06:14.300
Things happen. Nobody's perfect.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.740
And Ronnie...

06:16.776 --> 06:18.471
Ronnie will be fine.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.142
A unicorn. How mythicaI.

06:27.219 --> 06:30.484
I'd stick with the stained one
if I were you. Those suck.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.353
Pretty much.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.791
OK. Come with me.
There are some cooler places.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.156
Let's go!

06:37.830 --> 06:39.923
Call, write, text, but communicate.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.298
- OK!
- OK? I love you.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.496
Got lipstick.
Tell your sister I love her.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.869
- All right.
- Bye!

06:49.175 --> 06:51.643
Bye!

06:51.677 --> 06:53.770
- Ready?
- Come on!

06:54.480 --> 06:56.311
Bye, Mom!

06:57.049 --> 06:58.641
Thanks.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.548
What is all this stuff?

07:02.622 --> 07:07.423
Well, I am building a stained-glass
window for the church up the road.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.723
I saw it. How did it happen?

07:09.795 --> 07:11.228
Nobody's certain.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.323
They think it was some sort of accident.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.529
- This is so cooI.
- Yeah?

07:19.005 --> 07:21.405
Unfortunately,
I'm not really looking...

07:21.474 --> 07:23.704
for an assistant right now, so...

07:23.776 --> 07:26.438
Why not? No, Dad, I'd do it!

07:26.512 --> 07:27.672
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

07:27.713 --> 07:30.204
- You want it?
- I'd do it for free!

07:30.249 --> 07:32.217
- OK. You're hired.
- Really?

07:32.251 --> 07:34.310
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

07:34.353 --> 07:35.718
What kind of name is Blaze?

07:35.788 --> 07:37.915
A nickname my boyfriend,
Marcus, gave me.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.050
My reaI name's GaladrieI.
It's from Lord of the Rings.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.462
My mom's weird like that.

07:44.530 --> 07:47.055
Hey, I'm lucky it wasn't Frodo.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.528
How much?

07:49.568 --> 07:51.502
- Twenty.
- Too much.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.334
Oh, wait.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.636
I'm sorry. Today, it's free.

07:55.708 --> 07:58.370
- No, no. Stop.
- It's OK. I do it all the time.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.437
No. I can't. I already got busted once.

08:03.015 --> 08:04.778
A woman with a record.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.977
- Please.
- I like that.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.918
Stop it.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.882
- Dad's looking for you.
- Tell him you didn't see me, brat.

08:14.927 --> 08:18.124
- Five bucks. And two for "brat".
- No way.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.226
He's getting closer.
Don't make me raise it to ten.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.429
Shut up.

08:24.470 --> 08:28.463
I promise to make him take me on the
Twister three times so you can get away.

08:30.242 --> 08:32.642
- Nice doing business with you.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.071
CooI. So you live in New York?

08:36.115 --> 08:39.982
Yeah, I do now. I'm from Atlanta.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.215
I moved up north when I was 11.

08:44.490 --> 08:47.015
My dad moved here just a few years ago.

08:47.093 --> 08:50.824
- Without you all?
- Irreconcilable differences.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.456
Think that's the phrase.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.166
- He bailed.
- Families suck.

08:57.236 --> 09:00.069
I don't even live with mine.
I stay at Marcus' usually.

09:00.106 --> 09:03.075
You have to meet Marcus. Let's go.

09:15.654 --> 09:18.122
- Hook me up!
- Yeah!

09:22.161 --> 09:23.594
That's him.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.470
Thank you, everyone.
Donations are accepted.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.707
In fact, they're encouraged.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.580
This is good, huh?

09:47.686 --> 09:49.847
Good to have a little man time.

09:53.959 --> 09:56.484
Ronnie never opens any of your letters.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.928
Really?

09:57.997 --> 10:01.524
Mom says it's because she has PMS.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.195
Do you know what that is?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.398
Dad, I'm not a little kid anymore.

10:07.473 --> 10:10.067
Means "pissed at men syndrome".

10:11.443 --> 10:13.001
Yeah.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.511
So, Will, you want to get out of here?

10:16.549 --> 10:19.780
My parents are at some lame-o
award thing with the governor.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.082
They won't be home for hours.

10:22.154 --> 10:25.851
- They must trust you.
- Imagine that.

10:29.695 --> 10:32.755
My man! She tell you the good news?

10:32.832 --> 10:34.163
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.364
Cassie wants us to pick up some beer
on the way home, so we gotta do that.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.032
You know what, man?
I'm gonna skip it.

10:42.074 --> 10:44.975
No, no. Hello, hello.
Eyes right here, buddy. No.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.740
No skipping it tonight.
Look. Listen to me. OK.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.610
Will yes. Ashley yes.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.513
Ashley yes. Cassie yes.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.075
Cassie yes. Scott yes!

10:54.119 --> 10:57.987
- Come on. Take one for team Scott.
- Where you been, buddy?

10:58.057 --> 11:00.958
- You guys don't hang out with us.
- Get off him!

11:01.827 --> 11:05.058
Get off him. I love you, Will.
You're so butch.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.793
Always looking out for your friend.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.742
Come on. Dude, come on.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.924
Hey, Ronnie?

11:38.964 --> 11:40.363
Get me a drink?

11:40.432 --> 11:43.162
Is there something wrong
with your legs?

11:45.104 --> 11:46.765
I'll get it for you.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.183
I'm sorry. Are we boring you?

12:02.154 --> 12:03.485
I just don't drink.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.635
It's like a...
"just say no thing"?

12:33.185 --> 12:35.619
Because you could just say yes.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.349
Stop it.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.333
Don't ever touch me, ever again.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.200
Sorry.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.675
Jeez.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.191
I'm going to bed.

14:16.422 --> 14:20.119
Before I get completely grossed out,
you should know I'm in here.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.627
- Get out of my room!
- This is our room.

14:22.661 --> 14:25.186
OK? If you want to sleep in Dad's room,
that's fine.

14:32.337 --> 14:34.737
- Hey, Ron?
- What?

14:34.773 --> 14:36.104
Don't get mad, OK?

14:37.242 --> 14:40.302
Can you just be a little nicer to Dad?

14:41.313 --> 14:44.146
I just really don't
want to lose him again.

14:52.524 --> 14:55.687
Did you see his face
when he saw you here?

14:55.761 --> 14:58.229
He was so excited.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.198
Jonah, you never lost Dad, OK?

15:01.266 --> 15:04.895
You never lost him,
and you never will. I promise.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.926
- Ronnie, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.895
- Where were you?
- Out.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.835
Well, it's almost 1:00, so...

15:41.874 --> 15:43.842
You don't have to wait up for me.
I'm not 12.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.242
I wasn't worried about you
when you were 12.

15:46.311 --> 15:48.006
And now you are?

15:51.650 --> 15:53.618
If you're gonna be here,
you have to...

15:53.685 --> 15:55.846
I don't want to be here, Dad.

15:56.955 --> 15:59.423
That's just it.

15:59.491 --> 16:02.392
I don't want to be here.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.362
Is that not obvious?
Do you not get that?

16:05.397 --> 16:08.662
Yeah. Let's make the best of it, OK?

16:10.903 --> 16:12.427
Are you gonna play?

16:15.607 --> 16:18.906
Are you going to play? Because
if you are, I'm sleeping outside.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.953
- Hey, congratulations on Juilliard.
- Why? I'm not going.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.051
- That would be a mistake.
- Well,

16:36.094 --> 16:38.289
you and Mom would know about those.

16:38.363 --> 16:40.729
- I've learned from the best.
- That's enough!

16:40.766 --> 16:42.131
Damn it, that's enough!

16:44.036 --> 16:47.267
- It's OK, Jonah.
- I'm sorry, Jonah. Go back to sleep.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.969
I'll be there in a minute.

16:52.644 --> 16:56.637
If you're pissed at me and...
you wanna hurt me, fine, hurt me.

16:56.715 --> 17:00.344
Be mad, be angry,
but don't stop playing.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.148
It's stupid, Ronnie.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.981
It really is, and you're too talented.

17:07.392 --> 17:08.450
Are we done?

17:23.508 --> 17:25.339
Let's go, Ronnie!

17:25.410 --> 17:27.344
- Thanks.
- How about that?

17:27.412 --> 17:29.504
Ronnie, hey.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.605
It's a new day.

17:32.083 --> 17:35.917
Look, let's start over.
I got bacon here, got breakfast.

17:37.355 --> 17:38.686
Vegetarian, Dad.

17:40.091 --> 17:42.355
- Since when?
- A year and a half.

18:12.523 --> 18:14.684
Must have found a turtle's nest.

18:15.326 --> 18:19.228
I'm not going near it. Must be sick
or something if it's out in the daytime.

18:20.097 --> 18:22.327
Sure is enjoying those eggs.

18:22.366 --> 18:24.596
What? No, no, no, no!

18:24.669 --> 18:26.159
No!

18:29.674 --> 18:31.972
Oh, my God.

18:54.532 --> 18:56.932
She's losing it, Dad.

18:57.702 --> 18:58.896
Big time.

19:10.348 --> 19:12.646
A sea turtle laid eggs.

19:12.717 --> 19:15.311
The raccoons will eat them
if I don't keep them away.

19:16.253 --> 19:17.311
Really?

19:17.388 --> 19:21.051
When a female lays her eggs,
the raccoons smell them and...

19:21.092 --> 19:22.992
They'll eat every one if they can.

19:24.328 --> 19:27.889
This Web site told me
to call the aquarium...

19:27.932 --> 19:31.129
and see if I could get someone
to come here and protect them,

19:31.202 --> 19:34.103
- but my battery's dead.
- There's a number to the aquarium...

19:34.171 --> 19:39.074
on the wall by the phone. Honestly,
I don't know how they'll improve on...

19:39.110 --> 19:40.975
On that.

19:43.781 --> 19:46.147
Hey! Veronica!

19:46.217 --> 19:48.811
No, Ronnie, it's fantastic. I like it.

19:48.886 --> 19:50.979
You're overreacting!

19:55.726 --> 19:58.889
- Hey, Dad, can we fly a kite today?
- Absolutely not.

19:58.929 --> 20:01.921
We're flying three kites today.
All of us.

20:01.966 --> 20:03.831
You're dreaming, Dad.

20:04.802 --> 20:08.704
Yeah. I'd like to report some
sea turtle eggs outside of my house.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.569
Sure.

20:14.812 --> 20:17.781
- What?
- You said "outside my house".

20:17.815 --> 20:18.975
I like that.

20:19.016 --> 20:22.679
Did you go to, like,
a nice guy schooI or something?

20:22.753 --> 20:25.517
What's with all your smiling lately?

20:25.589 --> 20:27.454
Seriously, it's creepy.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.997
Is my...? Is my smile creepy?

20:39.036 --> 20:40.765
Well, I don't know. Let's see it.

20:41.772 --> 20:43.000
I'm doing it.

20:46.343 --> 20:50.006
Kind of, but I think
you need to show teeth.

21:08.165 --> 21:10.633
My grandmother used
to drive one of those.

21:10.668 --> 21:13.432
- She did?
- Yeah.

21:13.504 --> 21:14.994
Barely.

21:15.773 --> 21:20.107
Is that milkshake girI?
You should go spill that soda on her.

21:22.279 --> 21:24.270
Hey.

21:25.816 --> 21:29.274
Hi. Nice look.

21:29.353 --> 21:31.446
I almost didn't recognize you
with your shirt on.

21:33.724 --> 21:36.887
I'm sorry. I was stupid.

21:36.927 --> 21:39.122
- Yeah.
- It must have been the game.

21:39.196 --> 21:42.427
I get a little... jacked up.

21:44.401 --> 21:48.098
You know, I laid awake that night,
just remembering it.

21:48.172 --> 21:49.730
Felt like a jerk for hours.

21:51.909 --> 21:54.673
I seriously doubt that happened.

21:55.446 --> 21:57.038
You're wrong.

22:00.351 --> 22:01.943
I'll see you around.

22:03.888 --> 22:05.116
I hope so.

22:11.161 --> 22:14.494
What should I call you
when that happens?

22:14.565 --> 22:16.658
- Ronnie.
- Ronnie.

22:17.568 --> 22:18.933
Bye, Ronnie.

22:21.572 --> 22:22.630
Bye.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.877
You know who her father is, right?

22:35.986 --> 22:38.454
Yeah. So?

22:40.391 --> 22:41.449
Just checking.

22:42.726 --> 22:45.923
Hey, what's up? Did the aquarium call?

22:45.963 --> 22:48.864
- I don't know.
- Oh, crap.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.265
Hey! Hey!

22:52.136 --> 22:54.001
Hey!

23:40.484 --> 23:42.213
Hey.

23:46.657 --> 23:49.285
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

23:49.326 --> 23:52.818
- I asked you first.
- I'm here to mark a turtle nest.

23:55.399 --> 23:58.061
You work for the aquarium?
I thought you were a mechanic.

23:58.135 --> 24:01.229
- I don't work there. I volunteer there.
- I called yesterday.

24:03.107 --> 24:05.632
- Is everything OK?
- No, everything's not OK.

24:05.676 --> 24:09.305
- There were raccoons here all night.
- Really?

24:10.481 --> 24:12.574
- Where are they now?
- I scared them away.

24:12.650 --> 24:15.710
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
I'm a little scared.

24:17.454 --> 24:19.149
That's really funny.

24:19.189 --> 24:21.783
You know, I'd like to see
you sleep out here all night...

24:21.859 --> 24:26.023
while it's freezing with a baseball bat
in your hand and raccoons terrorize you.

24:27.931 --> 24:30.559
- You really slept out here all night?
- No.

24:30.601 --> 24:33.593
My hair looks like this all by itself.

24:33.671 --> 24:36.003
I wasn't gonna mention
the hair, but...

24:41.645 --> 24:43.306
This all your creation?

24:43.380 --> 24:47.043
- Do you have a problem with it?
- Not really.

24:47.084 --> 24:49.746
Other than the fact
that when the eggs hatch,

24:49.820 --> 24:52.022
turtles won't be able
to get back to the sea, so...

24:52.623 --> 24:53.823
they'll starve and die.

25:20.818 --> 25:22.410
Hey.

25:24.722 --> 25:26.485
Blaze.

25:27.891 --> 25:29.825
Blaze, what's wrong?

25:30.661 --> 25:33.755
I saw how you looked at him.
At Marcus? I saw you.

25:33.797 --> 25:36.664
- What are you talking about?
- I love him, OK?

25:36.734 --> 25:39.703
- So stay away.
- I am not interested...

25:39.770 --> 25:42.000
You're Iying!
I watched you flirt with him.

25:42.072 --> 25:44.472
The guy's a creep.
He was the one coming on to me.

25:44.508 --> 25:47.306
Why would you wanna be
with someone like that anyways?

25:47.377 --> 25:49.641
Excuse me.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.444
- What?
- I'm sorry. I have to check your purse.

25:52.483 --> 25:54.041
Fine.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.519
I did not take that.

26:01.592 --> 26:02.957
I didn't take...

26:07.131 --> 26:09.122
You're gonna have to come with me.

26:16.073 --> 26:18.906
- Mom's gonna flip out.
- Shut up. OK, Jonah?

26:18.976 --> 26:21.638
Ronnie, don't talk
to your brother like that.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.690
- Where you going?
- Home. Where do you think I'm going?

26:39.763 --> 26:41.663
I'm calling Mom.

26:41.698 --> 26:44.667
Let her go! Just let her go!

26:45.669 --> 26:49.571
We had a really nice day,
and you had to ruin it!

26:49.640 --> 26:53.701
Let her go! Let her.
Make her leave us alone!

26:57.648 --> 27:00.515
How do you want me to respond, Ronnie?

27:00.551 --> 27:04.009
- You want me to tell you it's OK...?
- I want you to believe me.

27:05.455 --> 27:07.719
But obviously, you can't do that.

27:17.334 --> 27:19.529
I did it in New York.

27:22.072 --> 27:24.370
I stole something.

27:25.442 --> 27:28.878
And I don't need you to tell me
that it's wrong, because I know that.

27:31.515 --> 27:33.881
But I didn't do it here.

27:37.254 --> 27:39.586
The store owner is a friend of mine.

27:41.158 --> 27:42.682
I'll talk to him.

27:46.430 --> 27:47.522
OK?

28:14.124 --> 28:15.955
Evening.

28:28.939 --> 28:30.566
Anna Karenina.

28:30.607 --> 28:33.007
"Happy families are all alike.

28:33.076 --> 28:36.375
Every unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way".

28:39.850 --> 28:42.785
Is quoting Tolstoy
supposed to impress me?

28:42.819 --> 28:46.277
I wasn't quoting Tolstoy.
I was quoting his translator.

28:46.323 --> 28:48.917
But since you asked...

29:07.711 --> 29:09.236
Are you moving in?

29:09.313 --> 29:10.711
Hey, If I wanna get some sleep,

29:10.712 --> 29:14.012
I may need something
to scare off the raccoons.

29:14.084 --> 29:16.382
They don't like bright lights
or music.

29:18.322 --> 29:20.449
You're planning to sleep here?

29:21.458 --> 29:24.757
Well, the truth is the town
sort of got together...

29:24.828 --> 29:27.991
and decided we couldn't take
another one of your bad hair days.

29:28.031 --> 29:30.522
Oh, really.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.535
So the word is
you're from New York.

29:34.204 --> 29:36.900
It's a small town, people talk.

29:38.008 --> 29:42.342
I got accepted to Columbia in the fall.
Who knows? We might be neighbors.

29:44.715 --> 29:47.513
So, what are you doing down here?

29:47.551 --> 29:51.578
My mom shipped me and my brother
to my dad's for the summer.

29:51.655 --> 29:53.079
Guess so I could baby-sit
turtle eggs...

29:53.123 --> 29:57.421
while a volleyball player slash aquarium
volunteer hits on me every five seconds.

29:57.494 --> 29:59.257
Now, who's conceited?

30:00.230 --> 30:02.858
Since we're on the subject,

30:02.899 --> 30:05.925
I'm not hitting on you.

30:06.003 --> 30:07.937
Seriously, I'm engaged to be married.

30:14.344 --> 30:16.642
What's the matter with you?!

30:16.713 --> 30:18.408
I'm sorry.

30:21.184 --> 30:23.277
This doesn't look good.

30:25.222 --> 30:27.816
You're not OK with this, are you?

30:31.261 --> 30:34.355
Then we'd better
maintain visuaI contact.

31:22.646 --> 31:24.113
Good evening.

31:26.316 --> 31:28.147
Hello, sir.

31:28.819 --> 31:30.286
Hey.

31:33.890 --> 31:36.859
You mind?

31:36.927 --> 31:38.326
No.

31:59.316 --> 32:01.614
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

32:33.216 --> 32:34.979
- Hello.
- Don't "hello" me.

32:35.018 --> 32:37.543
I need your name, soldier.

32:39.756 --> 32:41.747
I'm Will.

32:41.825 --> 32:44.453
- You are?
- I'm her roommate.

32:44.528 --> 32:47.827
The commanding officer
sent me out with rations.

32:47.864 --> 32:50.526
But unfortunately, it's vegetarian.

32:50.567 --> 32:53.536
So, personally, I'd rather eat sand.

32:55.071 --> 32:57.301
Thanks for the tip, bro.

33:03.046 --> 33:04.980
Hey.

33:05.048 --> 33:07.983
I'd better get going.
I'm supposed to be at the aquarium.

33:08.051 --> 33:09.609
Me too.

33:11.454 --> 33:14.514
Not hard-to-get again.

33:16.193 --> 33:19.390
Seriously, Ronnie.
You read Tolstoy.

33:19.429 --> 33:23.559
You take up arms
to defend innocent sea turtles.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.500
The ice-cube act's not working.

33:33.710 --> 33:35.575
Let's try it again.

33:37.047 --> 33:38.309
Last night was fun.

33:41.151 --> 33:43.483
- Best first date of my life.
- It was not a date.

33:43.553 --> 33:47.580
We could make it one, if you
don't mind coming to work with me.

34:33.937 --> 34:36.235
- It's kind of cooI, huh?
- It's incredible.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.501
- So big.
- Try cleaning it.

34:38.574 --> 34:41.408
It must be pretty cooI,
swimming with all the fish.

34:41.478 --> 34:44.675
- You should see it from in here.
- Maybe I will someday.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.148
Yeah.

34:47.183 --> 34:48.275
Give me a hand up?

34:52.822 --> 34:54.585
I'm gonna kill you!

35:07.671 --> 35:09.070
Dude!

35:09.973 --> 35:12.737
- Where you been?
- I'm sorry, man. She's such a klutz.

35:12.809 --> 35:15.369
- She fell in the tank five times.
- That is not true!

35:15.445 --> 35:16.776
- Ronnie, Scott.
- Hi.

35:16.846 --> 35:19.041
We got the tournament coming up.
Let's go.

35:19.115 --> 35:23.074
- Want to grab me a water?
- Fine. I'll be back in a minute.

35:25.355 --> 35:27.118
Wet hair?

35:27.190 --> 35:29.215
Let me guess. He took you
to the aquarium...

35:29.259 --> 35:32.558
and did his whole
underwater fish-man show for you.

35:32.595 --> 35:34.426
Were you impressed?

35:34.497 --> 35:37.591
- Do I know you?
- I'm a friend of Will's.

35:37.667 --> 35:40.795
But, you know, Will has lots of friends.

35:40.870 --> 35:44.328
He makes us all feeI speciaI.
For a little while.

35:56.586 --> 35:57.610
Bitch.

35:58.288 --> 36:00.051
There you go.

36:00.090 --> 36:02.854
OK. Spread it out a little.
Good job! Excellent.

36:02.892 --> 36:06.419
- I didn't burn a hole through it.
- No, you didn't.

36:06.496 --> 36:08.293
Hey, Dad.

36:08.365 --> 36:12.961
Do you and Mom ever talk
about getting back together?

36:13.036 --> 36:16.096
Jonah, your mom's about to get married.

36:16.172 --> 36:19.608
So? You have dibs.
You married her first.

36:19.676 --> 36:23.305
Yes, I did. And it was a good marriage.

36:24.714 --> 36:26.739
It was. It lasted a long, long time.

36:26.783 --> 36:28.910
We have two great kids out of it.

36:28.952 --> 36:32.979
It's just...
You know, love's not always...

36:34.624 --> 36:38.526
That's not always enough.
It's probably...

36:38.595 --> 36:40.995
hard to understand.

36:41.064 --> 36:44.966
What has one eye, speaks French
and really loves cookies?

36:45.001 --> 36:47.265
Are you talking...
Are you talking about love?

36:49.305 --> 36:52.672
OK, OK. Cookies. Very good.

36:54.778 --> 36:57.372
I changed the subject to cookies.
Is that cooI?

36:57.447 --> 36:59.347
Yeah. I'll get them.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.014
Is everything OK?

37:13.430 --> 37:15.364
Hey. You never came back for me.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.294
Ronnie?

37:18.334 --> 37:21.201
- Just go away! OK?
- What's wrong?

37:21.271 --> 37:23.330
Go away!

37:25.408 --> 37:28.468
Ronnie, what happened? Ronnie!

37:32.849 --> 37:36.250
I'm sorry, sir.
Could you tell me what's going on?

37:38.455 --> 37:42.585
That would require my understanding
how the female brain works,

37:42.659 --> 37:46.220
which I don't, but if you'd like
to come in and be clueless together,

37:46.296 --> 37:47.888
you're more than welcome.

37:50.033 --> 37:54.333
- That's OK. I'll just wait out here.
- Yeah.

38:10.253 --> 38:13.279
How long you think he'll stay?

38:13.356 --> 38:17.690
- Why don't you go ask him?
- He's not my boyfriend, he's hers.

38:17.727 --> 38:20.389
He's not my boyfriend, either.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.999
Do you think he'll
stay out there all night?

38:27.036 --> 38:28.765
That's hard to say.

38:28.838 --> 38:32.171
- A dollar says he is.
- A dollar?

38:33.543 --> 38:36.535
OK, you're on.
Let's make it interesting. 2 dollars.

38:36.579 --> 38:39.241
Two bucks. He's not staying there.

38:40.450 --> 38:44.409
What if he stays out there forever?
What if he never leaves and then dies?

38:44.487 --> 38:48.116
Yeah, and his corpse
is eaten by a bunch of raccoons.

38:49.058 --> 38:53.119
And then he still doesn't leave,
'cause that's how powerfuI his love is.

38:53.196 --> 38:55.391
What is wrong with you two?

38:55.431 --> 38:58.298
Turtles. Turtles eat his corpse.

39:02.372 --> 39:05.136
You need to leave.
You're freaking out my little brother.

39:05.208 --> 39:08.336
Not untiI you tell me what happened.
Was it Ashley?

39:08.411 --> 39:10.504
I saw you talking to her.
What did she say?

39:10.580 --> 39:13.481
- Just leave, all right?
- Tell me what she said to you.

39:13.550 --> 39:17.452
Will, I did not come here for some
stupid summer romance...

39:17.487 --> 39:19.512
with some stupid locaI boy...

39:19.589 --> 39:22.683
that has done this
with a thousand other girls.

39:22.759 --> 39:24.920
- What?
- Ashley told me about...

39:24.961 --> 39:27.828
all the girls you've been with.

39:27.897 --> 39:30.593
So I don't want to be
just the next girl...

39:30.633 --> 39:32.931
in your little parade of girls, Will.

39:32.969 --> 39:37.099
Going on the same date,
doing the exact same thing.

39:38.374 --> 39:41.810
I think that's why it would
just be better if we just end it.

39:41.878 --> 39:43.470
End it?

39:43.546 --> 39:45.173
End what?

39:45.248 --> 39:48.843
Ronnie, yes, OK, I went out
with other girls before I met you.

39:48.918 --> 39:52.149
That's the point. It was before I
met you! How can you be mad about that?

39:52.221 --> 39:57.181
Don't you dare make this about me. You
and I both know this is not my fault...

40:19.515 --> 40:21.745
You're not like the other girls.

40:54.884 --> 40:56.112
What just happened?

41:00.657 --> 41:04.024
- Your sister just got kissed.
- Dad!

41:04.060 --> 41:06.392
- Well, you did. Look at her.
- No!

41:06.429 --> 41:08.727
- Jonah! Look at that face.
- Dad!

41:08.765 --> 41:11.359
Your sister... Hey!
Let's write a song about being kissed!

41:11.401 --> 41:13.699
- I'm going to be sick.
- Ronnie got kissed...

41:13.736 --> 41:15.897
- Stop it!
- OK, OK.

41:15.972 --> 41:18.031
- Are you OK?
- Yes, yes, but...

41:18.074 --> 41:20.201
What?

41:20.643 --> 41:22.008
Wow.

41:22.045 --> 41:24.070
- I'm going to sleep.
- It's still there.

41:24.113 --> 41:26.308
- I hate you.
- Wow.

41:31.721 --> 41:33.416
Stop!

41:33.456 --> 41:35.253
Stop!

41:37.360 --> 41:39.225
Put me down!

42:45.128 --> 42:48.154
I can't believe you're
carving our name into the tree.

42:49.799 --> 42:52.825
- What's your middle initiaI?
- I'm not telling you.

42:52.902 --> 42:55.166
This is really lame.

42:56.139 --> 42:58.471
- "L"...
- "L"...

42:58.508 --> 43:00.499
And make it look nice.

43:09.886 --> 43:13.151
- I like this song.
- OK.

43:28.871 --> 43:30.498
Man, wow.

43:32.542 --> 43:35.010
You can really sing.

43:35.044 --> 43:38.343
Is there anything else
I don't know about you?

43:46.422 --> 43:48.253
No!

43:48.324 --> 43:49.848
Just go with it. We got it.

43:52.361 --> 43:53.555
No!

43:58.067 --> 43:59.591
No!

44:06.876 --> 44:10.539
- Where are we going?
- Just a little shortcut. Trust me.

44:12.615 --> 44:15.584
- How's it going out there?
- Oh, yeah.

44:17.787 --> 44:19.948
You know, it's getting kind of dark.

44:20.022 --> 44:22.081
This is usually the part where the guy
with the chainsaw...

44:22.124 --> 44:25.855
comes out from behind the trees
and hacks us to pieces.

44:25.895 --> 44:28.557
Could you just give it some gas, please?

44:31.901 --> 44:33.664
OK, a little harder.

44:36.672 --> 44:38.799
OK, OK!

44:44.280 --> 44:47.511
- No, please! No, no.
- Where are you going? Come here.

44:51.387 --> 44:53.252
I'm gonna get you.

44:59.195 --> 45:01.026
Come back over here!

45:04.333 --> 45:05.595
Where did you go?

45:14.477 --> 45:16.843
Will, I'm serious.

45:16.913 --> 45:20.679
Will, I am not meeting your family
for the first time looking like this.

45:20.750 --> 45:23.275
It's fine. They're not home.

45:24.253 --> 45:27.222
Besides, I'm not taking you
to the movies like that.

45:27.290 --> 45:28.723
Got a reputation to maintain.

45:28.758 --> 45:30.123
Wow.

45:35.998 --> 45:37.727
- Hello?
- Hey, George.

45:37.800 --> 45:40.132
- Hello, Will.
- What are we doing?

45:43.272 --> 45:45.069
Who's George?

45:59.155 --> 46:01.589
Will, where are we? Graceland?

46:03.159 --> 46:05.184
Wait. Do you work here too?

46:17.340 --> 46:19.865
This is your house? You live here?

46:23.379 --> 46:25.244
You're rich?

46:26.048 --> 46:28.539
Will, you told me that your dad
owned a brake shop!

46:28.584 --> 46:31.417
He does. He just happens
to own 300 more just like it.

46:31.487 --> 46:34.047
- No, no, I am not going in there.
- Yes, you are.

46:34.123 --> 46:36.114
Not looking like this!
What if somebody sees me?

46:36.192 --> 46:37.523
- Let go.
- Nope.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.551
- Let go.
- You let go!

46:40.563 --> 46:44.363
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What difference does it make?

46:44.400 --> 46:46.300
Hello.

46:46.369 --> 46:48.860
Mom. I thought you
and Dad were going out.

46:50.439 --> 46:52.805
We decided to come back early.

46:55.344 --> 46:57.710
This is Ronnie.

47:00.116 --> 47:01.743
Hi.

47:03.753 --> 47:06.449
Perhaps you should hose off in back.

47:08.524 --> 47:09.582
It's cold.

47:14.430 --> 47:16.159
Here, do my hair.

47:17.900 --> 47:19.060
Go.

47:24.206 --> 47:26.037
These are Will's sister's.

47:26.909 --> 47:29.400
They should fit you.

47:29.445 --> 47:31.106
Thank you, ma'am.

47:36.886 --> 47:39.480
Here, turn around.

47:39.555 --> 47:40.613
Cold!

47:40.656 --> 47:45.650
It's a family tradition. Both my parents
went to college at Vanderbilt.

47:45.728 --> 47:48.094
Tom and I actually met there.
Didn't we, Tom?

47:49.398 --> 47:53.300
And now, our William
will go there as well.

47:53.335 --> 47:56.168
- Where will you be going, Ronnie?
- I'm not...

47:57.940 --> 48:00.101
going anywhere.

48:01.610 --> 48:05.706
I mean, I don't really have
anywhere planned for me, or...

48:08.117 --> 48:11.143
I just haven't figured out
the whole college thing yet.

48:14.123 --> 48:16.819
But...

48:16.892 --> 48:20.328
Will, pass Ronnie some roast beef.

48:20.396 --> 48:23.126
- No, thank you.
- I told you, Ronnie's a vegetarian.

48:23.165 --> 48:26.100
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:28.304 --> 48:32.297
- Why?
- Just reasons.

48:35.811 --> 48:38.609
I mean, it's not that I don't
like people that like meat.

48:38.647 --> 48:41.639
I mean, they're fine. Just that...

48:41.684 --> 48:45.313
- How you been, Dad?
- Oh, I been good. Good.

48:45.354 --> 48:49.848
You know, I was going through
some of Mikey's stuff the other day.

48:49.892 --> 48:54.386
- And if you have time...
- That's enough, Tom.

49:04.607 --> 49:08.441
Well, she's a lot prettier
than you described her, Will.

49:08.511 --> 49:11.378
Thank you, Dad.

49:11.447 --> 49:13.881
You bringing her to the wedding?

49:16.318 --> 49:21.085
He didn't tell you? His sister's
getting married in a couple of weeks.

49:21.157 --> 49:25.150
No, I don't think you
did mention that, Will.

49:28.063 --> 49:30.623
- Would you like to come?
- Will?

49:30.699 --> 49:33.930
Your sister told me
that you were bringing Ashley.

49:34.003 --> 49:36.904
I sent out her invitation
just yesterday.

49:40.776 --> 49:42.801
- Ronnie, this is silly.
- Drop it, Will.

49:42.878 --> 49:44.436
I can't drop it. You're mad.

49:44.513 --> 49:46.037
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad.

49:46.081 --> 49:49.414
I'm not! You want to go to your sister's
wedding with your ex-girlfriend,

49:49.451 --> 49:50.918
- it's not a big deaI.
- Not as a date.

49:50.953 --> 49:53.888
She's a friend of my sister's.
I said it was OK if she came.

49:53.923 --> 49:56.653
Honestly, it's not a big deal
because I don't wanna go...

49:56.725 --> 49:59.193
to some wedding
where I don't know anybody.

49:59.228 --> 50:01.423
- Ronnie...
- And you just forgot to mention...

50:01.463 --> 50:04.432
you're going to Vanderbilt.
You told me you're going to Columbia.

50:04.466 --> 50:07.697
No, I didn't.
I told you I was accepted to Columbia.

50:07.736 --> 50:10.796
Ronnie, it's complicated, OK?
My parents are...

50:11.774 --> 50:15.232
- Not a good time to disappoint them.
- What's complicated? It's your life.

50:15.277 --> 50:18.212
- Go to the college that you want to.
- It's not that simple.

50:18.814 --> 50:20.805
Look, we don't have to do this.

50:22.318 --> 50:25.981
- What do you mean?
- Maybe you should find someone...

50:26.055 --> 50:30.822
that's more suited to your lifestyle.
You know, with her own rich parents,

50:30.893 --> 50:32.918
- her own perfect mansion...
- Ronnie,

50:32.962 --> 50:35.931
there is nothing perfect
about that house.

50:35.965 --> 50:40.129
Can you not see that? My parents
are holding on by a thread.

50:40.169 --> 50:44.629
Perfect? Nothing's been perfect
in my family for a long time.

50:53.449 --> 50:56.043
I had a brother. Mikey.

50:57.186 --> 50:59.177
He died last year.

51:00.489 --> 51:02.787
How?

51:02.825 --> 51:05.055
Car accident.

51:07.730 --> 51:09.664
My mom was driving.

51:09.698 --> 51:12.962
Mikey and I were in the back seat,
goofing off, playing Mercy.

51:13.768 --> 51:15.235
We were being idiots.

51:15.303 --> 51:17.828
She turned around to tell us to stop,

51:17.872 --> 51:20.340
and she lost controI of the car.

51:26.381 --> 51:28.576
He was killed instantly.

51:32.720 --> 51:36.656
It's just so hard
to feeI happy in that house.

51:39.360 --> 51:42.295
It's the only reason
I didn't invite you to the wedding.

51:43.498 --> 51:46.558
I went out with those girls
because I was...

51:46.634 --> 51:49.068
trying to feeI something again.

51:56.844 --> 51:59.608
No one has made me feeI
like you do, Ronnie.

52:03.318 --> 52:05.218
I don't want to lose you.

52:24.806 --> 52:26.330
I love you, Will.

52:28.176 --> 52:30.201
I love you too.

52:39.954 --> 52:43.481
And, since you asked...

52:45.693 --> 52:48.389
...there is something
that you don't know about me.

52:49.964 --> 52:51.625
Come here.

53:06.214 --> 53:08.444
What are we doing here?

55:01.028 --> 55:04.464
Hey. Did you have a good time?

55:12.673 --> 55:13.731
What?

55:14.842 --> 55:16.537
I played today.

55:19.514 --> 55:21.880
That's...

55:21.916 --> 55:23.975
That's good. How did it feeI?

55:29.223 --> 55:31.418
Like I never stopped.

55:38.099 --> 55:39.964
Dad...

55:43.237 --> 55:47.469
I'd probably talk about this with
a girlfriend if I had one here, but...

55:47.542 --> 55:51.103
I don't, so...

55:55.082 --> 55:58.813
So you wanna talk?
You wanna talk?

55:58.886 --> 56:00.513
Here we go.
Let's talk.

56:00.588 --> 56:03.079
Yeah?

56:09.630 --> 56:13.999
So you... you like this guy?

56:19.240 --> 56:22.300
You like him...
You like him a lot?

56:24.045 --> 56:25.603
I like him more than a lot.

56:28.082 --> 56:31.017
- Really?
- Is that crazy?

56:34.455 --> 56:37.424
Well, a little, but...

56:39.193 --> 56:42.356
love is, Ronnie.

56:42.430 --> 56:46.491
Crazy... a little.

56:48.703 --> 56:50.568
Thank you.

57:03.484 --> 57:04.883
Good night, Dad.

57:18.666 --> 57:20.031
Dad!

57:20.067 --> 57:21.694
- Hey!
- There she is.

57:21.736 --> 57:25.172
Look, a shoplifter and an arsonist.

57:26.507 --> 57:30.204
I'm sorry. Did you not know
about your dad and the church?

57:31.979 --> 57:34.539
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey, Jonah.

57:36.917 --> 57:38.714
- This is so cooI.
- It is cooI.

57:38.753 --> 57:40.880
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Dad.

57:40.955 --> 57:42.718
OK.

57:43.424 --> 57:45.358
What's up?

57:50.031 --> 57:52.898
Keep your head in the game, brother.
Got it?

58:28.035 --> 58:29.127
Yeah!

58:48.222 --> 58:49.883
Good game, man.

58:53.761 --> 58:55.251
Yeah!

58:58.966 --> 59:00.058
Here you go.

59:04.839 --> 59:06.238
Come on. Open it!

59:12.913 --> 59:14.938
Dad!

59:14.982 --> 59:18.179
Dad, you're right.
I got invited to the wedding.

59:23.791 --> 59:25.656
- That's great, and...
- Thank you.

59:25.726 --> 59:28.422
Since I know
you have nothing to wear...

59:28.462 --> 59:31.295
to a fancy Blakelee mansion to-do...

59:31.332 --> 59:33.630
- I wasn't gonna ask you.
- Forget it.

59:33.667 --> 59:36.295
Besides, I never got a chance
to get you a prom dress.

59:36.337 --> 59:39.738
- Not that you went.
- No.

59:50.384 --> 59:52.682
Why do you come here so much?

59:52.720 --> 59:55.348
I spent half my childhood
in this building.

59:55.389 --> 59:57.653
I loved it here. I still do.

59:57.691 --> 01:00:00.785
Then why do people
say you burned it down?

01:00:02.396 --> 01:00:05.854
- You heard that?
- Is it true?

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:10.830
Yes.

01:00:10.871 --> 01:00:14.102
I was the last one in here that night.

01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:17.406
I'd come in here to play the piano.

01:00:17.478 --> 01:00:20.311
The next thing I remember is waking up
across the street...

01:00:20.347 --> 01:00:23.578
after the firemen had carried me out.

01:00:23.651 --> 01:00:26.814
- How did it start?
- I...

01:00:26.854 --> 01:00:31.621
Just stupid. There were some candles
burning, I had fallen asleep, and...

01:00:31.692 --> 01:00:34.559
- Dad.
- I might have been a little confused.

01:00:34.628 --> 01:00:37.426
I was taking medicine
that my doctor had given me...

01:00:37.498 --> 01:00:41.457
- Medicine? What doctor?
- Ronnie, it's OK.

01:00:41.535 --> 01:00:44.902
It's OK now. I'm fine.

01:00:45.906 --> 01:00:48.136
This was last year. I'm fine.

01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:50.200
- You're OK?
- Yes.

01:00:53.948 --> 01:00:55.074
OK.

01:01:11.599 --> 01:01:13.658
He thinks that he did it.

01:01:16.971 --> 01:01:20.429
My dad thinks that he's the one
that burned down the church.

01:01:24.578 --> 01:01:26.603
I'm sure he didn't do it.

01:01:28.048 --> 01:01:32.280
It's just...
just people talking.

01:01:44.164 --> 01:01:46.098
Can we talk?

01:01:54.508 --> 01:01:56.339
What's up?

01:01:58.946 --> 01:02:02.279
- What's up, Will?
- You got to come clean about the fire.

01:02:02.983 --> 01:02:04.314
You didn't just say that.

01:02:04.351 --> 01:02:09.288
Her father thinks he did it. People in
town think he did it. You know that.

01:02:11.659 --> 01:02:13.650
How long you known this girI?

01:02:14.962 --> 01:02:17.294
You've known me your entire life.

01:02:17.331 --> 01:02:20.129
And you know that,
if you say anything...

01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:23.364
to anybody about that night,
my life is over.

01:02:27.408 --> 01:02:30.138
They'll say it was arson, Will,
and you know that.

01:02:31.812 --> 01:02:34.042
I'm going back to work.

01:02:38.152 --> 01:02:40.086
Just let it go, all right?

01:02:42.957 --> 01:02:45.551
I just want my money, OK?

01:02:45.592 --> 01:02:48.652
I don't have it, Marcus,
and you know that.

01:02:48.696 --> 01:02:51.392
- Just get it. Just get it. OK?
- Please.

01:02:51.465 --> 01:02:52.557
- Hey!
- I'll get it.

01:02:52.633 --> 01:02:56.091
Excuse me! Excuse me.
We're talking over here, OK?

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:59.367
- Blaze, are you OK?
- I said get the hell out of here!

01:02:59.406 --> 01:03:01.704
- Blaze!
- Just go away!

01:03:01.742 --> 01:03:03.539
Marcus! Stop!

01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:05.670
I'm not running
a damn homeless shelter!

01:03:05.713 --> 01:03:07.237
- Don't go!
- I want my money.

01:03:07.314 --> 01:03:10.875
- Don't go. Stop!
- Get off the car!

01:03:10.918 --> 01:03:12.783
- Off the car!
- Don't leave me!

01:03:12.853 --> 01:03:16.084
- I have nowhere else to live!
- Shut up!

01:03:17.825 --> 01:03:19.884
Don't go!

01:03:22.863 --> 01:03:25.525
Great! Great! Do you see what you did?

01:03:25.566 --> 01:03:28.228
Are you happy now? God!

01:03:31.772 --> 01:03:34.639
- You don't deserve that, Blaze.
- You don't know me, OK?

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:38.337
You don't know anything.
You just don't get it.

01:04:12.579 --> 01:04:13.910
Dad says lunch is ready.

01:04:13.947 --> 01:04:16.074
I can't eat. I got to find something
to wear to the wedding.

01:04:16.116 --> 01:04:18.812
What happened
to the money Dad gave you?

01:04:20.587 --> 01:04:23.351
If you tell him, I kill you, OK?

01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:27.224
I was on my way to buy the dress and...
I gave the money away.

01:04:27.261 --> 01:04:28.285
What?!

01:04:30.731 --> 01:04:32.358
Don't worry about it.

01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:36.597
Wow, you may be older,
but I am so much smarter than you.

01:04:46.747 --> 01:04:50.114
- Where did you get all that?
- Where to begin...

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:53.813
This is for when I told Dad
I didn't see you at the festivaI.

01:04:53.854 --> 01:04:56.948
This is what I won playing liar's poker.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:05:00.619
Remember when you snuck
in past curfew in New York?

01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:03.528
That's for that.
This is for the guy with the tattoo...

01:05:03.597 --> 01:05:05.724
OK, that's enough. I get it.

01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:11.699
I can't take your life savings.

01:05:11.772 --> 01:05:15.367
Knowing you, there's a lot more
where that came from.

01:05:15.442 --> 01:05:17.535
And besides, I like Will.

01:05:17.611 --> 01:05:20.808
I don't want him breaking up with you
'cause you look crappy at a wedding.

01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:25.111
Thank you.

01:05:39.566 --> 01:05:41.693
- I don't think he'll like it.
- I like it.

01:05:41.735 --> 01:05:44.829
- You can't wear that to a wedding!
- I like it!

01:06:39.526 --> 01:06:41.255
- Save me some cake, man.
- Yeah.

01:06:41.295 --> 01:06:42.387
Yo.

01:06:44.264 --> 01:06:46.425
Hey, no funny business.

01:06:46.466 --> 01:06:50.095
I don't think you can actually
try funny business at a wedding, sir.

01:06:50.137 --> 01:06:53.971
You can definitely
try funny business at a wedding.

01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:56.839
- I've done it.
- I see.

01:06:59.513 --> 01:07:01.640
Kind of makes this
a mixed message, then.

01:07:02.616 --> 01:07:05.244
- Hands off, OK?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.822
Ronnie.

01:07:23.337 --> 01:07:25.498
Do I look all right?

01:07:25.572 --> 01:07:27.335
Yeah.

01:07:38.952 --> 01:07:43.184
Do you, Philip Louis,
take this woman, Megan Blakelee,

01:07:43.257 --> 01:07:47.853
to be your lawfully wedded wife
as long as you both shall live?

01:07:47.894 --> 01:07:50.886
- I do.
- You may now kiss the bride.

01:08:10.951 --> 01:08:14.079
- Hey, Blaze.
- Hey.

01:08:15.555 --> 01:08:18.149
Look, I...

01:08:18.191 --> 01:08:22.560
I didn't deserve it, what you did
the other day, but... thank you.

01:08:22.629 --> 01:08:25.723
- It's OK.
- I broke up with him.

01:08:25.799 --> 01:08:29.428
Marcus. You're right,
he's totally a jerk.

01:08:29.502 --> 01:08:32.734
- And I moved out.
- Good for you.

01:08:32.805 --> 01:08:34.433
Yeah.

01:08:36.376 --> 01:08:39.004
OK, well, I should get back to work.

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:41.571
I'll see you around then, OK?

01:08:41.648 --> 01:08:43.513
Thank you.

01:08:59.066 --> 01:09:01.694
- You're a good dancer.
- And you're a liar.

01:09:01.734 --> 01:09:05.068
- You're also the prettiest one here.
- And now I know you're Iying.

01:09:10.277 --> 01:09:12.541
Get away from me, Marcus! I mean it!

01:09:12.578 --> 01:09:15.274
- You think you can just leave?
- Yes! We're done!

01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:19.376
Look, I got your note. I didn't like it.

01:09:19.419 --> 01:09:22.216
We're done when I say we're done.

01:09:22.255 --> 01:09:25.156
Marcus, what are you doing here?

01:09:25.225 --> 01:09:28.388
- Hey, just stay out of this, rich boy.
- I want you to leave.

01:09:28.428 --> 01:09:32.125
- Will? Who are these people?
- I got it.

01:09:32.198 --> 01:09:34.564
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- You people.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.229
You people just think you're
so much better than me.

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:40.238
- Blaze, walk away from him.
- No, no, no. You stay.

01:09:40.273 --> 01:09:42.298
This is his sister's wedding,
for God's sake.

01:09:42.376 --> 01:09:44.401
You're leaving. Get out of here.

01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:47.743
Suit yourself then.

01:09:48.381 --> 01:09:50.680
- Hey! Get in your truck!
- What?

01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:55.313
- How about now?
- All right, man, all right.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:58.452
I changed my mind.

01:09:58.492 --> 01:10:00.517
I don't want her. I want her.

01:10:02.662 --> 01:10:06.758
She seems like she'd be pretty fun
to have around for the summer.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.200
- Huh, William?
- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?!

01:10:11.905 --> 01:10:14.169
- Will!
- Ronnie!

01:10:18.278 --> 01:10:20.109
Will! Will!

01:10:20.147 --> 01:10:22.445
That's enough! Get up!

01:10:38.765 --> 01:10:39.857
Will...

01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:43.064
Just take the girI home.

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:46.867
Both of them. Just clear out.

01:11:05.058 --> 01:11:08.425
- Well, that was fun.
- Yeah.

01:11:08.495 --> 01:11:11.589
Think I finally won your mom over!

01:11:11.665 --> 01:11:15.863
Hey, guys! Dad thinks the turtles
are gonna hatch tonight. Come on!

01:11:15.902 --> 01:11:18.370
- All right, let's go.
- We don't want to miss it!

01:11:18.405 --> 01:11:19.838
- Get out here!
- We're coming!

01:11:19.873 --> 01:11:22.899
- Jeez, you guys are a mess!
- Thanks.

01:11:22.976 --> 01:11:25.410
- What did he say?
- Come on!

01:11:30.217 --> 01:11:32.378
- Oh, my God.
- Look at them.

01:11:32.419 --> 01:11:35.855
- BeautifuI.
- So cooI.

01:11:35.889 --> 01:11:38.517
- They're amazing.
- They're awesome!

01:11:54.374 --> 01:11:57.275
- Why are you doing that?
- To help them get to the sea.

01:12:10.223 --> 01:12:12.487
- I'm gonna get another light.
- OK.

01:12:12.559 --> 01:12:14.993
- I want one.
- I can't believe that we saved them.

01:12:35.048 --> 01:12:36.982
Daddy!

01:12:43.823 --> 01:12:47.315
Call 911. Daddy!

01:13:25.632 --> 01:13:28.066
I'm gonna need a rush on this.

01:13:30.103 --> 01:13:31.832
Hey.

01:13:31.871 --> 01:13:35.637
You should go home and change.
You'll scare the nurses.

01:13:38.111 --> 01:13:41.376
What you said before... are you sure?

01:13:55.028 --> 01:13:57.895
We'll make him as comfortable as we can,

01:13:57.964 --> 01:14:00.592
but the cancer has spread to his lungs.

01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:07.230
- How long?
- It's hard to know.

01:14:07.307 --> 01:14:10.504
But we're not gonna quit, OK?

01:14:15.982 --> 01:14:18.280
I want to tell you something.

01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:24.757
When your father realized
how serious his condition was...

01:14:24.824 --> 01:14:26.621
a couple months ago,

01:14:26.693 --> 01:14:31.255
he asked that we cut back
on his medication.

01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:33.356
Why?

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.925
Because he wanted to be here.

01:14:36.002 --> 01:14:39.870
Really be here
with you and your brother.

01:14:39.906 --> 01:14:41.897
That's what he said.

01:15:06.599 --> 01:15:08.567
Well, this wasn't on the calendar.

01:15:28.054 --> 01:15:29.954
- Ronnie...
- You lied to me, Dad.

01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:32.150
- I didn't lie.
- Yes, you did, Dad.

01:15:32.225 --> 01:15:35.661
You said you were fine.
You're not fine! That was a lie!

01:15:35.729 --> 01:15:38.027
I hoped.

01:15:38.098 --> 01:15:40.692
I didn't lie.
It's not the same thing.

01:15:46.406 --> 01:15:48.465
- It's all right to be angry.
- Good.

01:15:49.609 --> 01:15:52.476
Is this why you
brought me here this summer?

01:15:54.748 --> 01:15:57.808
Is it? So you wouldn't
have to be alone while...

01:16:01.988 --> 01:16:03.649
Why didn't you tell us?

01:16:05.525 --> 01:16:08.358
It's not what
I wanted this time to be about.

01:16:08.428 --> 01:16:12.228
- Well, it is now, Daddy!
- No, it's not.

01:16:12.298 --> 01:16:14.198
It's just another...

01:16:15.635 --> 01:16:18.832
...part of a terrific summer.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.331
Not one of the better parts, I admit.

01:16:27.614 --> 01:16:31.675
- Love you.
- Sweetie, I love you too.

01:16:33.286 --> 01:16:35.550
Come here.

01:16:37.023 --> 01:16:39.287
I love you, Daddy.

01:16:53.006 --> 01:16:55.600
You want some cookies, bro?

01:16:55.675 --> 01:16:58.940
Why won't anyone
tell me what's going on?

01:17:01.614 --> 01:17:05.846
Jonah, I think Ronnie and your dad
will talk to you as soon as they can.

01:17:07.987 --> 01:17:10.353
Why don't you tell me now?

01:17:12.392 --> 01:17:15.122
Well, it's complicated.

01:17:19.566 --> 01:17:21.056
Can I come and see him yet?

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.432
Yeah. He's waiting for you.

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:25.601
Come on.

01:17:47.293 --> 01:17:50.228
He's never gonna
get to see him grow up.

01:18:16.422 --> 01:18:18.014
Jonah!

01:18:18.725 --> 01:18:20.693
- Dang it!
- What are you doing?

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.092
- I can't reach it!
- Get down from there!

01:18:23.129 --> 01:18:24.994
- Get away!
- What happened to you?

01:18:25.064 --> 01:18:26.827
- Just get away!
- Get down!

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.595
- Hey, hey!
- Get away!

01:18:28.635 --> 01:18:31.627
- Hey, what's going on?
- Stay away! I can do it!

01:18:31.704 --> 01:18:34.298
Me and Dad have been working
on this all summer!

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.604
Me and Dad. Not you.

01:18:36.643 --> 01:18:40.238
All you cared about
was the stupid turtles...

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.546
and your stupid boyfriend!
I was with him every day!

01:18:44.617 --> 01:18:47.017
And now... Dang it!

01:18:47.086 --> 01:18:49.111
Now I can't reach things,

01:18:49.155 --> 01:18:52.818
and I need to finish this
so Dad will get better!

01:18:54.527 --> 01:18:57.462
- We'll help you.
- You don't know how!

01:18:57.497 --> 01:18:59.124
Will you show us?

01:19:08.341 --> 01:19:09.808
Yeah.

01:19:38.371 --> 01:19:41.101
- That's good, right?
- Yeah.

01:21:00.753 --> 01:21:03.119
What?

01:21:03.156 --> 01:21:06.990
Ronnie, I need you to take me home.

01:21:10.963 --> 01:21:12.897
OK.

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:16.692
We just have to stop here for a second.

01:21:34.887 --> 01:21:36.445
We finished it.

01:21:36.489 --> 01:21:40.653
Of course, I had to train an assistant,
but we did it.

01:21:41.928 --> 01:21:44.829
You did good, Joe-boy. Really.

01:22:12.358 --> 01:22:13.518
Please.

01:22:18.331 --> 01:22:20.424
OK.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.333
We were behind the church, sir.

01:22:29.375 --> 01:22:34.210
We were just goofing around
and drinking... and stuff.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.511
And then Marcus
and his guys showed up.

01:22:38.151 --> 01:22:42.019
And that's when Will left.

01:22:42.054 --> 01:22:46.388
And... then we started...

01:22:46.425 --> 01:22:48.757
We started playing around with...

01:22:48.828 --> 01:22:51.524
- Fire?
- Yeah.

01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:00.732
We should have told you sooner, sir.

01:23:00.806 --> 01:23:02.603
That's my fault.

01:23:03.843 --> 01:23:07.711
Will wanted to tell the police
right away, and I begged him not to.

01:23:07.747 --> 01:23:10.181
But we're gonna go
right after we're done here.

01:23:10.216 --> 01:23:12.275
No, don't do that.

01:23:13.719 --> 01:23:15.277
People think it was you, sir.

01:23:15.354 --> 01:23:19.017
Yeah... they do.

01:23:19.058 --> 01:23:20.582
They will. So what?

01:23:21.294 --> 01:23:23.421
It's... It's fine. Really.

01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:26.898
I don't want you to do that, OK?
This stays between us.

01:23:26.933 --> 01:23:28.992
Thank you, sir.

01:23:29.068 --> 01:23:31.628
- OK?
- Thank you.

01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:39.441
Wait.

01:23:42.148 --> 01:23:44.207
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:23:45.751 --> 01:23:47.116
- Ronnie!
- You were there?

01:23:47.186 --> 01:23:49.654
- I wanted to tell you.
- You saw what it did to him.

01:23:49.722 --> 01:23:51.917
I know! I tried to get Scott to fess up.

01:23:51.958 --> 01:23:53.585
Why didn't you say something?

01:23:53.626 --> 01:23:56.493
It's not that simple.
It wasn't about me! Scott's a good guy.

01:23:56.562 --> 01:23:59.861
I don't care, Will!
You knew how guilty my dad felt,

01:23:59.932 --> 01:24:02.594
and you let him feeI that way!

01:24:02.635 --> 01:24:06.571
Just go off to that college that your
parents have picked out for you.

01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:09.973
Go find some other girI that makes
you feeI alive for five minutes!

01:24:10.009 --> 01:24:12.000
- One that can stand to be near you.
- Stop.

01:24:12.078 --> 01:24:14.911
Don't touch me. Will!

01:24:14.947 --> 01:24:17.381
Don't touch me!

01:24:19.485 --> 01:24:21.680
You're a coward, Will.

01:24:21.754 --> 01:24:23.813
You're a coward, and you're a liar.

01:24:25.524 --> 01:24:27.321
And I don't trust you.

01:24:28.594 --> 01:24:30.027
I don't want you near me.

01:24:30.096 --> 01:24:32.792
And I don't want you near my dad.

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:35.391
Go.

01:24:37.103 --> 01:24:38.900
Go.

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.666
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:25:21.446 --> 01:25:23.471
I love you too.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.245
Are you packed?

01:25:31.323 --> 01:25:33.518
I'm not going with you, Mom.

01:25:34.693 --> 01:25:36.752
I'm gonna stay here with Dad.

01:25:37.495 --> 01:25:39.190
He's gonna get worse.

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:42.222
A lot worse.
And in a few weeks, he...

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:43.757
- I don't care.
- Honey.

01:25:43.835 --> 01:25:46.998
Your dad doesn't want you guys
to see him like this.

01:25:49.174 --> 01:25:52.974
AII I did all summer was fight with him.

01:25:54.946 --> 01:25:59.110
- I was so mean to him.
- No, no, baby.

01:25:59.184 --> 01:26:01.243
I promise you,

01:26:01.319 --> 01:26:04.618
it meant the world
to him to have you here.

01:26:05.357 --> 01:26:08.258
Look, Mom. I'm gonna stay.

01:26:32.917 --> 01:26:35.112
Hey, buddy. You OK?

01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:40.288
Are you gonna say goodbye?
I really don't want to hear it.

01:26:40.358 --> 01:26:42.656
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna say it.

01:26:44.162 --> 01:26:48.360
I'm not gonna say goodbye,
because I'm not going anywhere.

01:26:48.433 --> 01:26:50.628
OK?

01:26:50.702 --> 01:26:52.294
Come here.

01:27:01.146 --> 01:27:04.445
Every time a light shines
through that window we built...

01:27:06.217 --> 01:27:08.447
or any window at all...

01:27:10.155 --> 01:27:12.316
that's me, OK?

01:27:13.591 --> 01:27:15.718
I'm not going away.

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:33.896
Dear Ronnie, I miss the hours
we spent together at the piano.

01:28:33.938 --> 01:28:35.599
I miss being your teacher.

01:28:35.673 --> 01:28:38.540
<i>I know you see me as having left you,</i>

01:28:38.576 --> 01:28:41.670
but when your mother and I split up,
I was in a lot of pain.

01:28:41.713 --> 01:28:44.443
I just needed to come home.

01:28:44.516 --> 01:28:48.612
<i>I regret moving away from you
and Jonah more than anything.</i>

01:28:48.686 --> 01:28:50.119
I hope you'll forgive me.

01:28:50.188 --> 01:28:53.749
Your mom tells me you
completely failed your SATs,

01:28:53.825 --> 01:28:57.955
but I know how smart you have to be
to get every single question wrong.

01:28:58.029 --> 01:29:00.122
Congratulations, Ronnie.

01:29:00.198 --> 01:29:03.929
<i>I've told you before that none of what
happened between your mother and me...</i>

01:29:04.002 --> 01:29:06.562
<i>had anything to do with you or Jonah.</i>

01:29:06.604 --> 01:29:08.663
Love is fragile, Ronnie.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.004
And we're not always
its best caretakers.

01:29:11.075 --> 01:29:13.805
We just muddle through
and do the best we can...

01:29:13.878 --> 01:29:16.904
and hope this fragile thing survives,

01:29:16.948 --> 01:29:19.473
against all odds.

01:29:38.269 --> 01:29:41.466
He's probably started college by now.

01:29:41.506 --> 01:29:43.770
Do you miss him?

01:29:45.643 --> 01:29:47.770
What he did was wrong, Dad.

01:29:49.948 --> 01:29:52.678
Yeah.

01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:54.581
It was.

01:29:56.955 --> 01:29:59.185
I can tell you this:

01:30:01.326 --> 01:30:05.490
- He misses you.
- I doubt it.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.630
You don't even know who you are, Ronnie.

01:30:13.538 --> 01:30:15.733
Who am I?

01:30:17.942 --> 01:30:21.207
You are the kindest, sweetest...

01:30:23.147 --> 01:30:25.672
most beautifuI daughter
in the whole world.

01:30:25.717 --> 01:30:29.653
Thank you, but you're
kind of obligated to say that, Dad.

01:30:29.687 --> 01:30:31.086
Yeah, it is in the handbook.

01:30:35.126 --> 01:30:37.890
I don't have too many lectures
left on my timecard,

01:30:37.962 --> 01:30:40.487
so I really want you to hear this, OK?

01:30:42.667 --> 01:30:47.400
Someday, you are
gonna open your heart,

01:30:47.472 --> 01:30:49.963
and you're gonna play again.

01:30:53.277 --> 01:30:56.007
And it's not gonna be
to make your mother happy.

01:30:58.116 --> 01:31:00.744
And it's not gonna be to make me happy.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.212
It'll be for you.

01:31:05.657 --> 01:31:09.184
Because... music and...

01:31:10.528 --> 01:31:12.120
love...

01:31:15.266 --> 01:31:16.961
they're gonna bring you joy.

01:31:18.469 --> 01:31:20.369
Thank you.

01:31:43.227 --> 01:31:45.661
How's that song coming, lazy bones?

01:31:48.332 --> 01:31:50.800
Well, I'm not sure...

01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:53.000
I can finish it.

01:31:57.041 --> 01:31:59.271
My hands.

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:01.107
Do they hurt, Dad?

01:32:03.114 --> 01:32:05.776
Yeah.

01:32:05.850 --> 01:32:07.613
They do.

01:34:58.389 --> 01:35:00.550
You OK?

01:35:00.591 --> 01:35:03.458
I can't do it, Mom.

01:35:03.527 --> 01:35:07.657
Look, you have a right to shut down.

01:35:07.732 --> 01:35:11.259
Just, please, don't push me away.

01:35:11.302 --> 01:35:13.964
It's what I do, Mom.

01:35:14.005 --> 01:35:15.996
I push people away.

01:35:18.976 --> 01:35:21.604
I pushed Will away too.

01:35:22.914 --> 01:35:25.849
We're not perfect. Any of us.

01:35:25.917 --> 01:35:28.681
We make mistakes, we screw up,

01:35:28.753 --> 01:35:31.688
but then we forgive and we move forward.

01:35:31.756 --> 01:35:36.716
Honey, at least
you have the courage to feeI.

01:35:36.794 --> 01:35:39.422
You feeI everything so deeply.

01:35:40.865 --> 01:35:43.459
You're your father's daughter.

01:36:01.152 --> 01:36:03.120
OK.

01:36:14.966 --> 01:36:17.730
Thank you all for coming.

01:36:17.802 --> 01:36:20.737
A lot of you have known my dad
since he was a kid.

01:36:24.909 --> 01:36:26.740
I wrote a speech.

01:36:26.777 --> 01:36:29.075
A few, actually.

01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:35.342
Me and my dad,
we had a different language.

01:36:35.386 --> 01:36:38.048
A love that we always shared.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.390
And I know that...

01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:50.457
That's the one that he'd want me
to share with all of you guys today.

01:37:34.078 --> 01:37:36.137
Hi, Daddy.

01:38:52.289 --> 01:38:56.055
Ronnie, I'm really sorry for your loss.

01:38:58.863 --> 01:39:00.421
Hey.

01:39:02.666 --> 01:39:04.361
Look, thank you for everything.

01:39:04.401 --> 01:39:07.495
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

01:39:07.538 --> 01:39:09.802
I really appreciate
everything you did, though.

01:39:10.574 --> 01:39:12.269
Thank you.

01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:21.408
Hey.

01:39:23.053 --> 01:39:24.850
It was beautifuI, what you played.

01:39:25.389 --> 01:39:27.653
It was Dad's.

01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:31.252
- I finished it for him.
- I know he liked it.

01:39:32.863 --> 01:39:35.855
Thank you for coming, Will.
It meant so much to me.

01:39:37.902 --> 01:39:40.928
Ronnie, I have someone
I'd like for you to meet.

01:39:43.574 --> 01:39:45.633
I want to introduce you
to Tommy Hampton.

01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:48.610
He taught your father...

01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:01.784
Ronnie, I'm so sorry about everything.

01:41:01.819 --> 01:41:03.810
I'm sorry, too.

01:41:05.789 --> 01:41:07.950
People make mistakes, Will.

01:41:07.992 --> 01:41:10.483
Even the people that we love.

01:41:18.402 --> 01:41:20.165
I've decided to go to Juilliard.

01:41:20.237 --> 01:41:22.535
Yeah, I heard. That's great news.

01:41:22.606 --> 01:41:25.234
How's Vanderbilt?

01:41:26.744 --> 01:41:28.211
It's a really good school.

01:41:29.446 --> 01:41:33.382
Yeah. I'm not sure it's for me, though.

01:41:35.653 --> 01:41:38.884
- What do you mean?
- I'm thinking of maybe transferring...

01:41:38.956 --> 01:41:40.821
to Columbia next semester.

01:41:41.558 --> 01:41:44.994
So the girl I love can watch me
make a few more mistakes.

01:41:46.297 --> 01:41:48.663
What do you think about that?
