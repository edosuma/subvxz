00:01.990 --> 00:04.990
>> Julie: When Audrey didn't
show up for the veto meeting,

00:04.990 --> 00:07.410
her behavior started trending on
Twitter.

00:07.410 --> 00:13.990
Now, the biggest question is:
Will she show up for tonight's
live eviction.

00:13.990 --> 00:16.990
Welcome back to "Big Brother".

00:16.990 --> 00:21.700
[ Applause ]
>> Announcer: Previously on "big

00:21.700 --> 00:25.990
brother" -- Audrey threw Jason
under the bus.

00:25.990 --> 00:29.990
> You you need to target someone
that for sure is throwing your

00:29.990 --> 00:31.290
name out there.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.990
Jason is the only name I know.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.990
>> Giving him a one way ticket
to the block.

00:34.990 --> 00:38.990
>> I nominated you Jason and you
John.

00:38.990 --> 00:42.990
I have been told that you would
essentially come after me so

00:42.990 --> 00:44.540
therefore I'm putting you up.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.410
>> When Jason denied he was ever
coming after Shelli --

00:48.410 --> 00:49.990
>> I wouldn't.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.000
>> I heard it from Audrey.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.990
>> If what Audrey is telling me
is not true I don't know how

00:53.990 --> 00:56.990
much long I can continue to
protect her in the game.

00:56.990 --> 01:02.990
>> Announcer: Audrey went in
panic mode.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.990
>> I think he believes I had
something to do with it.

01:05.990 --> 01:07.990
And to be honest I probably did.

01:07.990 --> 01:09.990
>> Announcer: And she quickly
tried to backtrack.

01:09.990 --> 01:13.830
>> The only person I could think
to target is Jason because of

01:13.830 --> 01:14.000
what you told me.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.990
>> I heard that from all of you
guys when you were talking.

01:16.990 --> 01:23.410
>> That's a lie and I'm not
going to let you make me believe

01:23.410 --> 01:23.990
it.

01:23.990 --> 01:29.990
>> After losing the battle of
the block, John, Jason and the

01:29.990 --> 01:32.290
twins were forced to form a boy
band.

01:32.290 --> 01:39.990
When Audrey talked trash about
Shelli and her boy toy -- James

01:39.990 --> 01:41.540
ratted her out.

01:41.540 --> 01:44.990
>> She was talking negatively
about your guys, officially

01:44.990 --> 01:47.410
making her public enemy number
one.

01:47.410 --> 01:50.990
>> Audrey is digging her own
grave.

01:50.990 --> 01:58.410
>> At a 90's veto competition
that was the bomb -- Vanessa was

01:58.410 --> 01:59.990
saved by the smell.

01:59.990 --> 02:01.990
>> Congratulations, Vanessa.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.990
You have won the golden power of
veto!

02:04.990 --> 02:09.990
>> Announcer: When Audrey and
Clay got into a heated show
down --

02:09.990 --> 02:12.830
>> you are a blatant liar.

02:12.830 --> 02:16.540
>> Their word is at a higher
value than mine.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.990
>> Clearly.

02:18.990 --> 02:20.950
>> I swear on my life.

02:20.950 --> 02:23.990
>> Quit swearing on your life
and mine.

02:23.990 --> 02:25.990
Like you don't value your own
life. Like stop.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.990
>> Audrey chose not to attend
the veto meet.

02:27.990 --> 02:32.990
>> As everyone can see Audrey
decided not to participate.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.990
I decided to use the power of
veto on Jason.

02:34.990 --> 02:37.990
>> It couldn't save her from the
block.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.540
>> I'm naming Audrey as my
replacement nominee.

02:40.540 --> 02:43.990
>> Will Audrey make it to the
live eviction?

02:43.990 --> 02:48.830
And two new heads of household
will be crowned, all live on

02:48.830 --> 02:48.990
"Big Brother."

02:48.990 --> 02:51.990
>> You're so wack!

03:26.990 --> 03:33.290
[ Cheers and applause ]
>> Julie: Good evening.

03:33.290 --> 03:33.990
I'm Julie chen.

03:33.990 --> 03:37.700
Welcome to "Big Brother."

03:37.700 --> 03:40.990
For weeks, the majority of the
house has wanted Audrey gone,

03:40.990 --> 03:43.990
but the 6th sense alliance
kept her safe.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.540
Now, after a public blowup with
Clay, her allies have turned

03:46.540 --> 03:48.410
against her.

03:48.410 --> 03:52.990
And everyone is wondering, will
Audrey leave the game before the

03:52.990 --> 03:58.990
house has a chance to evict her?

04:04.990 --> 04:08.000
>> This is a really unique
situation.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.990
Audrey didn't participate in the
veto meeting and I think that's

04:11.990 --> 04:14.990
first time in "Big Brother"
history that the replacement

04:14.990 --> 04:15.990
nominee wasn't there.

04:15.990 --> 04:19.990
But I'm pretty sure what just
happened isn't going to derail

04:19.990 --> 04:23.990
the tbleencht.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.410
>> The past few days have been
really tough for me.

04:26.410 --> 04:27.990
I felt up and down.

04:27.990 --> 04:32.990
I have been sad, angry,
disappointed, confused.

04:32.990 --> 04:37.990
I'm not the one single-handedly
putting her up on the block.

04:37.990 --> 04:38.990
This is the best decision for
all of us.

04:38.990 --> 04:41.990
>> The veto has been used.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.540
Vanessa used it on me thankfully
and not only that but the main

04:45.540 --> 04:49.990
target in the house for pretty
much the entire summer has

04:49.990 --> 04:50.990
finally been nominated.

04:50.990 --> 04:57.990
It's Audrey's turn.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.990
>> I'm giving you a high 5.

04:59.990 --> 05:02.990
>> The long version that
everyone is freaking out about

05:02.990 --> 05:07.990
and we're on a rage oh, she's
going home, she's going home.

05:07.990 --> 05:08.990
Well she's not there.

05:08.990 --> 05:12.990
So now what?

05:12.990 --> 05:16.990
>> Well, we just made "big
brother" history right there.

05:16.990 --> 05:21.990
Someone just sitting out of a
veto meeting? Someone sitting

05:21.990 --> 05:23.990
out of the ceremony --
>> crazy times, man.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.990
>> Is she going to not show up
for eviction?

05:27.990 --> 05:30.990
What is she planning on doing?

05:30.990 --> 05:38.410
>> This is raze.

05:38.410 --> 05:42.290
>> Like she can't skip this
stuff.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.990
Is she going to skip eviction.

05:43.990 --> 05:45.990
>> I think she just didn't want
to be part of this.

05:45.990 --> 05:46.990
>> This is crazy.

05:46.990 --> 05:49.290
Audrey doesn't show up for the
veto meeting.

05:49.290 --> 05:52.290
At one point we didn't even know
if Audrey was staying in the
house.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.990
>> Doesn't seem to be in good
shape.

06:16.990 --> 06:19.990
>> No.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.990
How long has she been in there?

06:33.990 --> 06:34.990
An hour?

06:34.990 --> 06:34.990
Maybe longer.

06:34.990 --> 06:39.290
>> About an hour and a half.

06:39.290 --> 06:46.990
>> I actually believe -- she
can't greater than perspective

06:46.990 --> 06:50.830
active and is truly having a
meltdown.

06:50.830 --> 06:54.000
>> Oh, what a week.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.990
>> This is strange.

06:55.990 --> 06:56.990
>> I know.

06:56.990 --> 07:00.990
>> She's trying to --
>> what is she trying to do.

07:00.990 --> 07:04.700
>> I have no issues with Audrey
as a person.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.990
>> Nobody does.

07:05.990 --> 07:11.990
>> I might if she walks.

07:11.990 --> 07:18.990
>> There are thousands of people
that would give anything to be

07:18.990 --> 07:20.990
here and to do that to them.

07:20.990 --> 07:23.990
>> Some people's pride is worth
emotion money.

07:23.990 --> 07:32.990
>> Yeah, but pride, it's pride
just to walk out the back door.

07:32.990 --> 07:35.990
>> She was fine doing this to
everyone else but as soon as it

07:35.990 --> 07:38.990
happens to her, she's like oh, I
have to walk out.

07:38.990 --> 07:39.990
Audrey has been in the diary
room for hours.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.700
It's pissing me off.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.990
So many of us have been battling
to stay just one more week and

07:45.990 --> 07:48.990
here Audrey is, just maybe going
to walk out.

07:48.990 --> 07:52.830
This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity.

07:52.830 --> 07:54.990
What is this?

07:54.990 --> 07:59.990
>> Why would you do that?

07:59.990 --> 08:01.290
>> What is happening.

08:01.290 --> 08:02.990
>> I have no idea.

08:02.990 --> 08:04.990
>> Tell me what is going to
happen.

08:04.990 --> 08:07.990
>> Me and Audrey have had plenty
between us in this game.

08:07.990 --> 08:09.990
>> You are pathological.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.950
>> You are.

08:10.950 --> 08:12.990
>> You are pathological.

08:12.990 --> 08:16.990
>> All of the mistrust in the
house has been planted by you.

08:16.990 --> 08:20.990
>> Even with all of that I would
like to see her go out with her

08:20.990 --> 08:25.990
head held high and really
playing the game to the end.

08:25.990 --> 08:28.990
>> Even those people that left
before and called the hoh to

08:28.990 --> 08:32.990
get a letter to read out so they
call Shelli in the dining room

08:32.990 --> 08:39.990
and we know what it is.

08:39.990 --> 08:42.120
>> I need a haircut desperately.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.990
>> You really do.

08:45.990 --> 08:48.290
>> I know.

08:48.290 --> 08:53.990
>> She is going to --
>> she is coming out.

08:53.990 --> 08:54.290
>> Right.

08:54.290 --> 09:02.290
>> What the ... -- What the
...

09:02.290 --> 09:07.990
>> Audrey finally comes out of
the diary room and I swear to

09:07.990 --> 09:09.990
God I feel like I have just seen
a ghost.

09:09.990 --> 09:12.990
I would bet she would not come
back in the house.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.990
I'm so shocked she is still
here.

09:15.990 --> 09:20.290
>> She was in four or five
hours.

09:20.290 --> 09:24.700
>> Like I'm serious, the way
Audrey just emotionalizes it,

09:24.700 --> 09:27.540
I don't know if she could handle
this game any further.

09:27.540 --> 09:39.990
>> After last night, I don't
think she can.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.990
>>
>> it's been a few days since I

09:53.990 --> 09:54.990
have seen Audrey.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.990
I feel bad on a personal level.

09:56.990 --> 10:01.990
I wanted to put the game aside,
make her a nice omelette and

10:01.990 --> 10:02.990
hope she feels better.

10:02.990 --> 10:05.990
>> I made you an omelette and
o.J.

10:05.990 --> 10:59.990
You don't have to eat it but
it's there for you if you want.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.990
>> She's going back in.

11:01.990 --> 11:09.990
>> Once again Audrey scampers
her way into the diary room.

11:09.990 --> 11:11.990
And I'm thinking is she staying?

11:11.990 --> 11:12.990
Is she going?

11:12.990 --> 11:15.990
Is this the last time I'm going
to see her in the house?

11:15.990 --> 11:16.410
Who knows.

11:16.410 --> 11:21.990
>> What is happening now?

11:28.990 --> 11:30.990
>> After days of speculation
it's clear that Audrey has

11:30.990 --> 11:31.990
remained in the house.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.830
Coming up, she's have one last
chance to save herself from

11:34.830 --> 11:40.990
eviction as she faces her out
-- her housemates tonight live.

11:40.990 --> 11:44.990
And later, Brittany haynes joins
me to talk about this season.

and talk to the houseguests.

12:21.990 --> 12:23.990
Hello, houseguests.

tonight?

12:26.990 --> 12:27.410
>> Good.

12:27.410 --> 12:31.950
>> Well I know this week has
been a little bit tense so I

12:31.950 --> 12:35.990
thought I would lighten the mood
and start with Jason.

12:35.990 --> 12:41.120
Jason, you spent the week as a
member of the wack street boys.

12:41.120 --> 12:46.990
Now initially you treaded it put
it looked like you were starting

12:46.990 --> 12:47.950
to enjoy it.

12:47.950 --> 12:47.990
>> I am.

12:47.990 --> 12:53.990
I was not excited to get my
outfit at first but it was not

12:53.990 --> 12:56.990
as bad as I expected.

12:56.990 --> 12:58.830
>> You three did so well.

12:58.830 --> 12:59.830
>> Oh, thanks.

12:59.830 --> 13:04.990
>> And you should all know that
the wack street boys have taken

13:04.990 --> 13:09.990

Oh, yeah!

13:13.990 --> 13:15.120
No joke.

13:15.120 --> 13:20.990
In fact the back street boys
sent out this tweet a few days

13:20.990 --> 13:20.990
ago.

13:20.990 --> 13:23.990
Do you want to hear what they
had to say?

13:23.990 --> 13:30.290
This is a direct quote from
them: Hey, Jason, Liz and John,

13:30.290 --> 13:37.990
we're definitely fans of your
moves.

13:37.990 --> 13:43.990

I'll be back in a few minutes
for the live vote and eviction.

14:58.990 --> 15:02.990
Before Audrey excluded herself
from the others this week she

15:02.990 --> 15:05.990
was incredibly open about her
personal journey.

15:05.990 --> 15:10.410
It's a courageous trait familiar
to her friends and family.

15:10.410 --> 15:14.990
But what do they think about how
she's played the game.

15:14.990 --> 15:18.990
>> Are you wondering at all what
is going on at home.

15:18.990 --> 15:19.700
>> A little bit.

15:19.700 --> 15:23.990
>> I know my family is probably
like trippin' out still.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.990
My family is in a little tiny
town.

15:26.990 --> 15:31.410
So they're probably overwhelmed
because I'm sure everyone in the

15:31.410 --> 15:34.990
neighborhood communicates and
like, whoa, Audrey is this --

15:34.990 --> 15:37.990
>> was your name the same before
everything?

15:50.990 --> 15:56.700
>> I am the first transgender
person to be on "Big Brother."

15:56.700 --> 15:56.990
>> Oh, my God!

15:56.990 --> 16:03.120
>> What?

16:03.120 --> 16:07.990
>> This is her first time really
coming out on a large scale

16:07.990 --> 16:08.290
platform.

16:08.290 --> 16:11.990
>> I guess she kind of gets to
live not in a shell.

16:11.990 --> 16:14.990
>> To have that kind of freedom
1 important.

16:14.990 --> 16:16.990
>> My name is mark and I'm
Audrey's father.

16:16.990 --> 16:23.990
People sit back and they wonder,
let's see photos when he was an

16:23.990 --> 16:24.410
Adam.

16:24.410 --> 16:29.990
But all of the photos that that
we have are Audrey as Audrey.

16:29.990 --> 16:35.410
>> One thing Audrey has had all
along is family support.

16:35.410 --> 16:38.990
>> My name is mireya and I'm
Audrey's mom.

16:38.990 --> 16:42.990
When she wanted my input as far
as the name I said, I have

16:42.990 --> 16:44.990
always liked the name Audrey.

16:44.990 --> 16:45.990
It was very simple.

16:45.990 --> 16:48.990
I think we both fell in love
with the name together.

16:48.990 --> 16:51.000
>> How is your family with this?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.990
>> I'm grateful for them.

16:53.990 --> 16:55.990
It's unbelievable how close we
are.

16:55.990 --> 16:58.990
>> It's you're typical
mother-daughter relationship.

16:58.990 --> 17:03.990
You just have your arguments and
your good days and your fun

17:03.990 --> 17:03.990
times.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.990
She's a very special child.

17:06.990 --> 17:12.990
>> It's really cool that you
just like are coming here.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.990
>> This experience, it goes
beyond myself.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.990
>> Transsexual is that the right
word?

17:17.990 --> 17:18.540
>> No.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.700
>> What is the right bond?

17:20.700 --> 17:20.990
>> Transgender.

17:20.990 --> 17:23.000
>> I don't even like that word?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.950
>> What word do you like.

17:24.950 --> 17:28.990
>> I just like female.

17:28.990 --> 17:30.990
Transgender I think of
transitioning.

17:30.990 --> 17:34.290
>> You were trangender and now
you're female.

17:34.290 --> 17:38.120
>> That's how I feel about it.

17:38.120 --> 17:42.990
>> Audrey, just tied it up.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.120
>> Congratulations, Audrey.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.990
>> Audrey started playing the
game from the git-go.

17:49.990 --> 17:52.540
>> There needs to be a big move.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.990
>> It would be a big move to
back door the other hoh.

17:55.990 --> 17:58.990
>> The other people were getting
to know each other and milling

17:58.990 --> 18:00.990
around and she is playing the
game.

18:00.990 --> 18:02.990
>> I just want to be direct
about it.

18:02.990 --> 18:03.990
>> About what?

18:03.990 --> 18:06.990
>> The whole house knew about
the idea of you going.

18:06.990 --> 18:10.990
Everybody wants you out because
you make feel feel

18:10.990 --> 18:10.990
uncomfortable.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.990
>> You are a master manipulator.

18:12.990 --> 18:13.990
>> What did I do?

18:13.990 --> 18:18.990
>> People are excluding her and
she realizes it and wishes she

18:18.990 --> 18:20.990
do put her self in a better
situation than she can.

18:20.990 --> 18:23.990
>> In her everyday life I don't
think Audrey wakes up to piss

18:23.990 --> 18:28.990
somebody off but in a game where
there are 16 ruthless savages

18:28.990 --> 18:33.990
vying for $500,000, why not
lie?

18:33.990 --> 18:42.120
>> I think you got caught up
playing.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.990
>> Audrey's tears, are they real
or calculated?

18:45.990 --> 18:48.990
>> I do think she is genuinely
upset.

18:48.990 --> 18:51.540
I just wish she would have
slowed down.

18:51.540 --> 18:55.830
>> Game plan going in was set
the pace of the game, to go in

18:55.830 --> 18:55.990
playing very hard.

18:55.990 --> 18:58.990
>> We knew she was going to
start the pop.

18:58.990 --> 19:03.990
>> Audrey did everything she
said she was goi.D she completed

19:03.990 --> 19:05.990
another of the many dreams she
set out to accomplish.

19:05.990 --> 19:10.950
>> Audrey spent a life not
worrying about being excluded.

19:10.950 --> 19:11.990
Audrey is a party of one.

19:11.990 --> 19:17.990
>> You can't win the game with a
party of one.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.990
>> Coming up, it's the live vote
and eviction.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.990
Stay with us.

19:36.830 --> 19:37.990
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

19:37.990 --> 19:39.700
Audrey or John?

19:39.700 --> 19:42.540
One of them is about to trade in
the "Big Brother" house for

19:42.540 --> 19:43.990
their own house.

19:43.990 --> 19:47.410
But before we begin tonight's
live eviction, Audrey has

19:47.410 --> 19:50.990
already received one penalty
vote because she chose to break

19:50.990 --> 19:54.290
the have not food rule by eating
regular food throughout the
week.

19:54.290 --> 19:56.830
Let's go to the house and begin
the vote.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.990
Houseguests it's time for the
live vote to begin.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.990
Audrey, John, in just moments
your housemates will cast their

20:02.990 --> 20:03.990
vote to evict live.

20:03.990 --> 20:07.990
Before they do you each have a
final chance to sway their vote

20:07.990 --> 20:09.990
with one brief statement.

20:09.990 --> 20:10.990
Audrey, you're first.

20:10.990 --> 20:13.990
>> Ok.

20:13.990 --> 20:20.990
So first "Big Brother" fans you
can find me after this at Audrey

20:20.990 --> 20:21.990
m.

20:21.990 --> 20:24.990
Houseguests I want to say what
an honor it has been to come on

20:24.990 --> 20:28.990
this platform with 16 people who
come from totally diverse walks

20:28.990 --> 20:32.120
of life, including myself, being
the first transgendered person

20:32.120 --> 20:36.990
on the show and to be embraced
on the first day and not

20:36.990 --> 20:38.990
questioned a day after.

20:38.990 --> 20:43.990
It's really unique for me and
powerful that we all get to

20:43.990 --> 20:47.990
share this and exemplify this to
America from. A game

20:47.990 --> 20:51.990
perspective I think this is a
move your guys have wanted for a

20:51.990 --> 20:55.990
few weeks now so merry
Christmas.

20:55.990 --> 20:56.990
>> John?

20:56.990 --> 21:02.290
>> I want to give a shout out to
j dog and my wack street boys.

21:02.290 --> 21:03.540
Sorry about what happened.

21:03.540 --> 21:04.540
It got out of hand.

21:04.540 --> 21:09.990
I think the group is patchable
and that stain will come out

21:09.990 --> 21:11.990
maybe.

21:11.990 --> 21:13.990
Everyone else I had fun being
here.

21:13.990 --> 21:15.990
If you want to keep me, that's
awesome.

21:15.990 --> 21:16.990
If not, cool.

21:16.990 --> 21:18.990
>> Thank you, John.

21:18.990 --> 21:19.990
Thank you both.

21:19.990 --> 21:21.990
Time for the live voting to
begin.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.990
Shelli as the current head of
household you're not allowed to

21:24.990 --> 21:24.990
vote.

21:24.990 --> 21:26.290
Neither are the two nominees.

21:26.290 --> 21:30.700
One at a time the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

21:30.700 --> 21:33.990
cast your vote to evict.

21:33.990 --> 21:36.700
Clay, you're first.

21:36.700 --> 21:41.540
Please head to the diary room.

21:41.540 --> 21:45.000
>> It was the fight between Clay
and Audrey that put the target

21:45.000 --> 21:46.990
clearly on her back.

21:46.990 --> 21:50.990
He will most likely take this
chance to send her packing.

21:50.990 --> 21:50.990
Hey, Clay.

21:50.990 --> 21:51.990
>> Hey Julie.

21:51.990 --> 21:54.990
>> Please cast your vote to
evict.

21:54.990 --> 21:56.990
>> I vote to evict Audrey.

21:56.990 --> 22:00.990
>> Mom, dad, Cole, love y'all,
miss y'all.

22:00.990 --> 22:01.990
>> .

22:01.990 --> 22:04.990
>> Julie: James showed person
and compassion for Audrey this

22:04.990 --> 22:06.990
week but will it affect his
vote?

22:06.990 --> 22:08.000
>> Hi, James.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.990
>> Please cast your vote to
evict.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.990
>> I vote to evict Audrey.

22:12.990 --> 22:13.990
>> Thank you.

22:13.990 --> 22:15.990
Thank you, Julie.

22:15.990 --> 22:19.540
>> Julie: Austin was certain
that Audrey had walked out of

22:19.540 --> 22:20.120
the game.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.410
Now that she stayed, what will
he do.

22:22.410 --> 22:23.990
Hi, Austin.

22:23.990 --> 22:24.990
>> Hello, Julie.

22:24.990 --> 22:25.990
>> Please cast your vote to
evict.

22:25.990 --> 22:29.120
>> All votes in the house are
supposed to be unanimous but

22:29.120 --> 22:33.990
Judas will vote John.

22:33.990 --> 22:36.950
>> Jason had several run ins
with Audrey.

22:36.950 --> 22:39.990
Will he take this chance to vote
her out of the house.

22:39.990 --> 22:45.990
>> For Da'vonne I vote to
evict Audrey.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.990
>> Thank you.

22:48.990 --> 22:52.990
>> Julie: Vanessa has been one
of Audrey's best friends in the
house.

22:52.990 --> 22:56.990
But did the blow up between them
change all of that.

22:56.990 --> 22:58.990
Hi, Vanessa.

22:58.990 --> 22:59.990
>> Please cast your vote.

22:59.990 --> 23:01.990
>> I vote to evict Audrey.

23:01.990 --> 23:05.990
>> Thank you.

23:05.990 --> 23:08.990
>> Becky and John have bonded in
the game.

23:08.990 --> 23:11.990
No doubt he has her support
tonight.

23:11.990 --> 23:12.990
>> Hi, Becky.

23:12.990 --> 23:13.990
>> Hi Julie.

23:13.990 --> 23:17.990
>> Please cast your vote to
evict.

23:17.990 --> 23:20.990
>> I can't break up the band.

23:20.990 --> 23:21.990
I vote to evict audly.

23:21.990 --> 23:22.990
>> It's official.

23:22.990 --> 23:26.990
With six votes evict Audrey,
Audrey will leave house tonight.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.990
Let's see how the other votes
fall.

23:29.990 --> 23:29.990
Hi, Jackie?

23:29.990 --> 23:31.000
>> Please cast your vote.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.990
>> I vote to evict Audrey.

23:33.990 --> 23:34.000
>> Thank you.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.990
>> Thank you.

23:37.990 --> 23:42.990
>> Last week Steve voted against
the majority the eviction, will

23:42.990 --> 23:46.540
he do it again tonight.

23:46.540 --> 23:46.990
Hi, Steve.

23:46.990 --> 23:47.990
>> Hi, Julie.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.990
>> Please cast you ever vote to
evict.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.990
>> I vote to evict Audrey.

23:51.990 --> 23:53.000
>> Thank you.

23:53.000 --> 23:53.990
>> Thank you.

23:53.990 --> 23:59.990
>> The twins are part of the
6th sense alliance that turned

23:59.990 --> 24:00.990
on Audrey this week.

24:00.990 --> 24:03.990
Will they vote with their
allies.

24:03.990 --> 24:04.990
>> Please cast your vote.

24:04.990 --> 24:08.990
>> I vote to evict Audrey.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.990
>> Thank you.

24:10.990 --> 24:14.950
>> Meg was in on the plan to get
Audrey out of the house.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.830
Her vote should be obvious.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.990
>> Hi, Meg.

24:17.990 --> 24:18.290
>> Hi.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.290
>> Please cast your vote to
evict.

24:20.290 --> 24:21.990
>> I vote to evict Audrey.

24:21.990 --> 24:22.990
>> Thank you.

24:22.990 --> 24:25.990
>> Thanks.

24:36.990 --> 24:40.000
>> All of the votes are in let's
give the news to the
houseguests.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.990
The votes are in.

24:41.990 --> 24:45.410
When I reveal the vote the
evicted houseguest will have

24:45.410 --> 24:48.410
just a few moments to say
goodbye gather his or her

24:48.410 --> 24:50.990
belongings and walk out of the
front door.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.950
With nine votes to evict plus
one penalty vote, Audrey, you

24:54.950 --> 25:01.000
are evicted from the "big
brother" house.

25:01.000 --> 25:10.990
>> Ok.

25:10.990 --> 25:18.410
>> Ok.

25:18.410 --> 25:20.990
>> Is this real?

25:20.990 --> 25:22.990
Is it really real?

25:22.990 --> 25:24.540
>> That's hysterical.

25:24.540 --> 25:25.990
>> Bye.

25:25.990 --> 25:28.290
>> Bye.

25:28.290 --> 25:33.990
>>
>>

25:33.990 --> 25:48.990
[ cheers and applause ]
>> You can put your bag down.

25:48.990 --> 25:51.990
>> Up next, I'll talk one-on-one
with Audrey.

25:51.990 --> 25:55.990
Stay with us.

26:26.990 --> 26:28.950
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

26:28.950 --> 26:32.830
Audrey was just evicted and
she's here now with me.

26:32.830 --> 26:34.990
I know.

26:34.990 --> 26:39.990
>> In your plea just now, you
mentioned you made "Big Brother"

26:39.990 --> 26:43.120
history as the first transgender
houseguest ever.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.990
On night number one you told all
of your housemates and they

26:46.990 --> 26:47.990
started clapping.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.000
They accepted you right away.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.990
Did that immediate acceptance
and that warm response surprise

26:54.990 --> 26:54.990
you?

26:54.990 --> 26:56.990
>> Absolutely.

26:56.990 --> 27:01.990
I didn't know what to expect
because in my personal life, I'm

27:01.990 --> 27:03.990
not screaming it from the
rooftops.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.990
It's a scary thing to come out.

27:06.990 --> 27:08.990
Especially for the first time,
especially on national

27:08.990 --> 27:08.990
television.

27:08.990 --> 27:09.990
So it was overwhelming.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.990
I definitely had to pinch myself
a couple of times.

27:12.990 --> 27:14.700
>> How did it make you feel?

27:14.700 --> 27:18.990
>> Oh, it made me feel --
there's not a word for it.

27:18.990 --> 27:22.990
It's -- it was a spectacle
moment in my life that I will

27:22.990 --> 27:24.990
always remember and get to
rewatch.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.290
>> Let's talk about the game.

27:26.290 --> 27:29.990
We saw your ups, we saw your
downs.

27:29.990 --> 27:31.990
You are a huge fan of "big
brother."

27:31.990 --> 27:33.990
You have been for a long time.

27:33.990 --> 27:38.990
Was playing it much harder and
much different than you thought

27:38.990 --> 27:40.830
it was going to be?

27:40.830 --> 27:42.950
>> Yes.

27:42.950 --> 27:47.990
It is an emotional Incubator in
there and I was like I'm not

27:47.990 --> 27:50.990
going to have any emotions and
I'm just going to go in there

27:50.990 --> 27:52.990
and play this cold hearted.

27:52.990 --> 27:56.990
And I pretty much didn't do
anything I said I was going to

27:56.990 --> 27:56.990
do.

27:56.990 --> 27:59.700
>> That's "Big Brother," expect
the unexpected.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.990
The vote was 9-1.

28:01.990 --> 28:04.990
Why do you think your allies
turned on you.

28:04.990 --> 28:08.990
>> Well, it's always smart to
vote with the house.

28:08.990 --> 28:13.990
But my allies do you mean
specifically Shelli and Clay, I

28:13.990 --> 28:15.830
think that --
>> and Vanessa.

28:15.830 --> 28:17.410
>> And Vanessa.

28:17.410 --> 28:18.990
Vanessa with good reason.

28:18.990 --> 28:22.990
I feel like her reason is
justified and all of her reasons

28:22.990 --> 28:25.990
are justified because she's that
good.

28:25.990 --> 28:30.990
But I took a leap of faith in a
conversation I had with Vanessa

28:30.990 --> 28:34.990
to Shelli and Clay and they
didn't keep it within

28:34.990 --> 28:34.990
themselves.

28:34.990 --> 28:39.990
I guess they thought I was
trying to plant seeds of doubt

28:39.990 --> 28:40.990
against Vanessa.

28:40.990 --> 28:42.990
And I was but it was genuine.

28:42.990 --> 28:46.990
>> Do you want so see the
goodbye messages your housemates

28:46.990 --> 28:48.700

Know that I love you forever and
I just hope you can grow from

29:01.990 --> 29:04.990
this experience instead of, you
know, being hurt from it.

29:04.990 --> 29:08.990
I love you, I wish you the best
and I will see you soon.

29:08.990 --> 29:12.990

house and telling your story

29:41.990 --> 29:42.990

that would take and I'm sure you

encouragement to a lot of people

I wish you best the luck with

We don't know what he is, right?

40:40.990 --> 40:45.990
I mean we don't know, is he
human or what is he, but we love

40:45.990 --> 40:45.990
it.

40:45.990 --> 40:47.990
>> At least 95 percent.

40:47.990 --> 40:49.990
I mean we love it.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.290
I love him.

40:51.290 --> 40:52.990
>> What about the twin twist.

40:52.990 --> 40:54.990
What do you make of the twins?

40:54.990 --> 40:58.990
>> I think the twin twist took a
whole different direction than I
would have seen it going.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.000
The house figured it out but
instead of it making them the

41:02.000 --> 41:04.990
target they thought this is a
way to bring this to our

41:04.990 --> 41:06.990
advantage and bring in the extra
number.

41:06.990 --> 41:08.700
I was surprised.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.990
I didn't think it would go down
that way but it has been

41:10.990 --> 41:15.990
interesting to watch and I can't
wait for the other one to

41:15.990 --> 41:16.410
actually make it in.

41:16.410 --> 41:18.990
>> Who is your pick to win the
whole game?

41:18.990 --> 41:23.990
>> Predictions here, I think
it's probably going -- I think

41:23.990 --> 41:25.990
Vanessa has a great shot.

41:25.990 --> 41:28.990
Either one half of the Shelli
Clay situation, Shelli or Clay.

41:28.990 --> 41:32.990
The other one will get picked
off probably pretty soon.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.990
And then there will be a floater
at the end, too, and sometimes

41:35.990 --> 41:38.990
they end up -- they do
surprising things.

41:38.990 --> 41:39.990
Jackie is hoh now.

41:39.990 --> 41:40.990
I was like, who?

41:40.990 --> 41:42.990
>> Are you saying she's a
floater?

41:42.990 --> 41:46.000
>> I just saw her for the first
time, I think.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.990
>> Oh, Brittany haynes, ladies
and gentlemen!

41:49.990 --> 41:54.990
[ Cheers and applause ]
36 days have come and gone but

41:54.990 --> 41:57.830
there's still a whole lot of
game to be played.

41:57.830 --> 42:01.990
Tune in Sunday to see who Jackie
and Vanessa nominate for

42:01.990 --> 42:06.990
eviction and another heated
battle of the block.

42:06.990 --> 42:09.120
On Wednesday the power of veto
could save one houseguest.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.990
And one week from tonight is
another live eviction.

42:12.990 --> 42:15.990
Can Liz and Julia survive?

42:15.990 --> 42:19.990
If they do they will both enter
the house and each play the game

42:19.990 --> 42:20.990
as individual houseguests.

42:20.990 --> 42:23.990
It all happens live next
Thursday.

42:23.990 --> 42:27.290
Don't forget every Friday, Jeff
schroeder hosts the "big

42:27.290 --> 42:30.990
brother" live chat at 3:00 P.M.

42:30.990 --> 42:33.990
Pacific, noon pacific on CBS.Com
and don't miss "Big Brother"

42:33.990 --> 42:37.990
after dark airing tonight and
every night on pop..

42:37.990 --> 42:42.410
Let's eavesdrop on the
houseguests.

42:42.410 --> 42:43.990
With Brittany, I'm Julie chen.

42:43.990 --> 42:46.990
Good night.
