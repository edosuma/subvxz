<i>Yeah ?</i>

Why are you
cookin' garments ?

01:44.937 --> 01:47.371
Gloria's boilin'
one of Mike's shirts.

01:47.439 --> 01:50.875
The dye in it
was giving him a rash.

01:50.943 --> 01:53.377
Why don't you boil him
instead ?

01:53.445 --> 01:56.881
Dye. Give me somethin'
to take the taste
out of my mouth.

01:58.317 --> 02:00.251
What'd you make here,
instant coffee ?

02:00.319 --> 02:03.254
No, it's fresh perked.
Well, it tastes
like instant.

02:03.322 --> 02:07.258
It's fresh perked, though.
Okay, it's fresh perked,
but it tastes like instant.

02:07.326 --> 02:09.259
I heard you.
But it's fresh perked.

02:09.328 --> 02:11.763
I accept
that it's fresh perked !

02:14.666 --> 02:17.102

You're a pip.
You know that ?
A real pip.

02:21.473 --> 02:24.909

but crackers here ?
Gloria went to the market.

do a big shopping
every Saturday morning.

Every Saturday.
God forbid one week
you do it on a Friday.

02:32.451 --> 02:34.652
You gotta watch out
for that "rigid-idness."

your whole personality.

football highlights
every week at this time.

02:44.363 --> 02:48.399
I know, but channel 13
is rerunning that special
on pollution with Jack lemmon.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.902
When I want to learn
anything about pollution,

02:50.970 --> 02:54.405
I don't have to learn it
from no millionaire actor who's
got nothin' better to do...

02:54.473 --> 02:56.407

to unpollute somethin',

02:58.477 --> 03:00.879
let him
unpollute the movies--
all them nudies.

03:00.946 --> 03:02.881
Archie, you're always
watching football.

03:02.948 --> 03:05.884
I think it's important
that we learn about
our polluted environment.

03:05.951 --> 03:07.886
You're pollutin'
my environment.

03:07.953 --> 03:09.888
Now, get away
from my set.

03:09.955 --> 03:13.391
Can't we at least sit down
like rational people
and discuss this ?

03:13.458 --> 03:17.361
Discuss. Why with you
has always everything
gotta be like a meetin' ?

03:17.429 --> 03:21.232
Because in a meeting
people sit down together
and exchange ideas.

- Well, it is.

when he was runnin'
through the jungle.

and thickets, barefooted,
with a tiger on his butt.

That some of your coloreds
don't have funny names ?
Oh, yeah, sure they do.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.485
Oh, Archie, you go first.
Here.

23:41.552 --> 23:44.488
Come on.
The last pickup is 4:30.
We'll be late.

24:03.474 --> 24:05.909
That was so thrilling.

24:08.146 --> 24:11.681
Imagine, two letters
to the president...

24:11.749 --> 24:13.683
From the same house.

24:13.751 --> 24:17.087
Every American ought to
write to his president.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.589
Yeah. It feels good
being a citizen.

24:19.657 --> 24:22.125
It's wonderful
to be involved.

24:24.395 --> 24:26.329
Archie.
Mmm ?

24:26.397 --> 24:28.331
Did you jiggle ?
What ?

24:28.399 --> 24:30.833
The mailbox.
You put the letters in.

24:30.901 --> 24:32.835
Afterwards,
did you jiggle ?

24:32.903 --> 24:35.338
Certainly I jiggled--

24:35.406 --> 24:37.607
wait a minute.

24:37.675 --> 24:40.843
I-- no, uh--

24:40.911 --> 24:42.845

jiggle ?

24:42.913 --> 24:45.348
I didn't jiggle.
I thought you jiggled,
daddy.

24:45.416 --> 24:49.152
Well, I always did
all my life,
but I don't know.

24:49.220 --> 24:52.655
Edith, what do you think
we oughta do ?

24:52.723 --> 24:55.225
I think
we'd better go jiggle.

24:55.293 --> 24:58.228
Why didn't you jiggle,
meathead ?
You put the letters in the box !

24:58.296 --> 25:02.732
Can't I rely on you
to do nothin' right ?
The man that mails, jiggles !
