It's your time.
That's what it's there for.

00:10.575 --> 00:13.294
- When would you wanna go?
- I'd like to go immediately.

00:13.495 --> 00:17.204
It's me that's made her upset.
I've exhibited jealousy, a lack of fun...

00:17.415 --> 00:20.248
...and how much I enjoyed
our relationship.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.252

He did his own commercials.

00:58.975 --> 01:02.763
Oh, yeah? Well, now we know what
he did for breakfast. He took it first.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.931
She got three in the torso,
two for him...

01:05.334 --> 01:07.246

was heading for cover.

in that kind of racket.

01:10.095 --> 01:12.689
Super said she'd been here two months,
just got divorced.

01:12.855 --> 01:15.574
She asked for an extra dead bolt.
Said her ex was pissed off.

01:15.975 --> 01:19.524
- Didn't want him busting in.
- I guess it was on the super's to do list.

01:19.695 --> 01:22.573

MARTINEZ: He started the canvass.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.843

We'll re-canvass.

Well, you see, Miss Novak,
most of the other tenants were out.

01:44.535 --> 01:48.130
- It's important that we talk to you.
- Yes, but I doubt that I can help you.

are really kicking in.

02:16.775 --> 02:19.164
Were you acquainted
with the victim? She lived there.

02:19.335 --> 02:23.214
Alicia Glover. No, I told the detective
I don't think I knew her.

02:24.495 --> 02:26.804
Jay Markowitz?
That name sound familiar to you?

02:26.975 --> 02:31.526
- He was visiting Miss Glover.
- No.

02:32.335 --> 02:34.769
You know, her apartment had
fresh flowers in it...

02:34.935 --> 02:38.564
...kind of like these right here.
- Hyacinth.

02:39.055 --> 02:41.410
She could have bought them here.

02:41.575 --> 02:43.964
I just didn't know her by name.

02:47.015 --> 02:50.371
Could I ask you a favor, detective?

02:50.575 --> 02:54.363
Would you mind checking the security
of my back door? I live here alone.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.608
We really don't think it was
an intruder who did these crimes.

02:57.775 --> 02:59.925
Looks like there was
a personal motive, but...

03:00.095 --> 03:02.450
Excuse me. I'll check it for you.

03:12.695 --> 03:15.084
I think you're fine here.

03:16.855 --> 03:20.450
If you're worried, maybe a dog
might not be a bad idea.

03:20.655 --> 03:22.885
- Preferably one that barks.
- Yeah.

03:23.095 --> 03:25.165
Did Detective Medavoy
ask you if you'd seen...

03:25.335 --> 03:28.054
...any unusual activity in the alley?
Anyone moving quickly?

03:28.215 --> 03:30.649
- Yeah. Yeah, he asked.
SIMONE: Uh-huh.

03:32.135 --> 03:34.490
But you didn't see anything?

03:34.655 --> 03:36.452
No.

that relates to the homicides...

think might be helpful...

That'd be great.

03:53.335 --> 03:56.771

for your home security advice?

03:57.335 --> 04:02.045

She had a good view
of the alley behind the building.

05:55.735 --> 05:58.169

I have to tell you, detective.

- What's that?
- I wasn't honest at my apartment.

- Did you get a good look at him?
- I think I got a pretty good look.

He was about 5' 11 ".
He had thick eyebrows...

what he was wearing?

No jacket.

09:03.695 --> 09:05.845

in his hand...

I didn't tell you, detective.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.167
Hm?

13:06.335 --> 13:09.486
That's fine. We'll get
all the information down.

13:09.655 --> 13:13.330
In terms of what is on your statement,
Miss Novak, the man was 5' 10"...

13:13.495 --> 13:15.884
...thick eyebrows, clean shaven,
with a crooked nose?

13:16.055 --> 13:19.843
A white shirt, no jacket,
and a brown paper bag in his right hand.

13:20.055 --> 13:22.489
You have a very specific memory.
That's good.

13:22.655 --> 13:24.885
How far away from him
would you say you were?

13:25.055 --> 13:26.534
About 40 feet.

13:26.695 --> 13:28.765
COSTAS: Do you ever wear glasses?
- No, I don't.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.852
That's the A answer.

13:31.055 --> 13:33.933
Excuse me. What's the additional
information, Miss Novak?

13:34.575 --> 13:37.248
I think the man saw me.

13:38.375 --> 13:41.924
- Mm. What makes you think that?
- I should say I know he saw me.

13:42.095 --> 13:44.450
He looked me right in the eye
as he ran past.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.685
I just wouldn't admit it
because it scares me.

13:46.855 --> 13:49.085
How did he react
when your eyes met? Did he stop?

13:49.255 --> 13:51.723
- Did he say anything?
- No, he just kept running.

13:52.815 --> 13:57.172
Is there anything else that could be
pertinent that you haven't told us?

13:57.335 --> 14:01.010
No, that's everything.
I know I should've said this before.

14:03.015 --> 14:04.892
Do you think I'm in danger?

14:05.055 --> 14:09.048
I wanna talk to ADA Costas for a minute,
okay? And I'll be right back.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.854
Thank you for your cooperation,
Miss Novak.

14:12.055 --> 14:15.934
As the case develops,
I'm sure we'll see each other again.

14:18.015 --> 14:20.085
SIMONE:
Be right back.

14:21.455 --> 14:23.685
You said that she didn't
originally come forward?

14:23.855 --> 14:25.925
Yeah. You'd think that
when she did come in...

14:26.095 --> 14:29.292
...saying she was seen would be
the first thing that she'd talk about.

14:29.455 --> 14:32.094
That doesn't discredit her,
but it does worry me a little.

14:32.255 --> 14:34.689
Her description of the bag
fits how you found the gun?

14:34.855 --> 14:36.607
Yeah, paper bag in the trash can.

14:36.775 --> 14:40.131
Look, I think she's probably reliable.

14:40.295 --> 14:44.254
Saying she was seen,
she may be looking for a police guard.

14:44.415 --> 14:47.054
Think she's got someone in mind?

14:48.095 --> 14:50.848
- All right, keep me posted.
- Okay.

14:57.215 --> 15:01.447
All right, Miss Novak, you're finished.
We appreciate you taking the time.

15:01.655 --> 15:04.169
You wanted to talk to me
about whether I was in danger.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.128
- When did I say that?
- Just before that woman left.

15:07.695 --> 15:09.970
Oh, you mean, the ADA.
Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:10.135 --> 15:12.251
I believe that you're safe
in your apartment...

15:12.655 --> 15:16.284
...but if you have a friend or relative
you'd rather stay with, that'd be fine.

15:16.455 --> 15:20.414
I thought the police
might give me protection.

15:20.575 --> 15:23.408
- That what you want?
- I'd prefer it, yes.

15:23.575 --> 15:26.885
- I really have no one to stay with.
- Fine, we'll get you a motel room.

15:27.415 --> 15:29.770
- Lf that's necessary.
SIMONE: We'll get you a room.

15:29.975 --> 15:33.172
We'll get you a female detective
to stay with you, all right?

15:33.935 --> 15:36.768
- You think that's sufficient precaution?
- Yeah, absolutely.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.607
They do a lot of this.

15:50.815 --> 15:53.648
We were doing more on lottery tickets
than on the ice cream.

15:54.095 --> 15:57.167
I mean, sometimes there was a line.
You'd think it was Radio City.

15:57.375 --> 16:00.333
Somebody went out of the store
last year with a $25,000 ticket.

16:00.535 --> 16:02.765
So after that, it became
the lucky place.

16:02.975 --> 16:05.694
Would there've been checks
or money orders in the register?

16:05.855 --> 16:08.289
I don't know.
There's always a few money orders.

16:08.495 --> 16:11.885
- We wouldn't have checks till Friday.
- You looking for something to trace?

16:12.055 --> 16:14.011
A gun? Did you keep
a gun in the store?

16:14.215 --> 16:18.003
Just a bat behind the counter.
She must've tried to take that to him.

16:18.575 --> 16:21.089
- That's the bat they found next to her.
DETECTIVE: Savino.

16:21.255 --> 16:21.415
We had that bat
since you swept the floors.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.213
We had that bat
since you swept the floors.

16:24.375 --> 16:27.048
Excuse me a second, Mr. Neiberg.

16:27.455 --> 16:30.049
Detective, can I talk to you?

16:33.735 --> 16:35.646
On those prints off of the countertop...

16:35.815 --> 16:38.613
...four hits from BCI,
three guys with narcotics collars.

16:38.775 --> 16:40.925
I'll check those against
that methadone clinic.

16:41.095 --> 16:43.928
I know who this other guy is,
this James Madlow.

16:44.095 --> 16:47.451
We used to call him Jimmy Socks
because his feet stank.

16:47.615 --> 16:51.130
Doesn't really fit, does it?
Bad checks?

16:52.055 --> 16:53.886
SIPOWICZ: Ernie.
- Hey, Andy.

16:54.055 --> 16:57.047
- I should've figured you'd be here.
- I'm sorry about your mother.

16:57.215 --> 16:58.364
I know.

16:58.535 --> 17:01.493
- Ernie Neiberg, Detective Savino.
SAVINO: I'm sorry about your mother.

17:01.655 --> 17:04.727
- I appreciate you coming in.
- All right.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.605
She's gone, Ernie.

17:09.015 --> 17:12.212
- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
ERNIE: I don't know, Pop.

17:12.375 --> 17:14.969
- Why didn't she give them the money?
- I don't know.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.126
- Are you done with my father?
- Yeah.

17:17.295 --> 17:19.809
Mr. Neiberg, you gotta try
and think for me.

17:19.974 --> 17:24.252
- None of those kids were mad at us.
- Just if anyone comes to mind.

17:24.415 --> 17:27.724
When was the last time either of you
saw Jimmy Madlow? Jimmy Socks?

17:27.895 --> 17:30.409
When he moved out of the neighborhood.

17:30.735 --> 17:33.807
- You remember Jimmy Madlow, Moe?
- No.

17:34.015 --> 17:36.404
- Jimmy Socks, Dad.
- I don't remember him.

17:36.615 --> 17:38.810
- The kid with stinky feet.
- He doesn't remember.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.684
- What difference does it make?
- They found his prints on the counter.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.767
- Jimmy Madlow? Jimmy Socks?
- Yeah.

17:45.975 --> 17:47.966
He was in the store three nights ago.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.774
Remember, I was watching
the store for you, Pop?

17:50.935 --> 17:52.891
Jimmy came in.
He was in the neighborhood.

17:53.055 --> 17:55.489
He stopped in to say hello.

17:55.655 --> 18:00.126
I gotta get back. I'll keep in touch
with this through Detective Savino.

18:00.295 --> 18:02.365
We're gonna keep
Detective Sipowicz posted.

18:02.575 --> 18:04.645
DAVE: Thanks for seeing us through.
- Yeah.

18:04.815 --> 18:07.852
DAVE: I'll call you.
- Moe...

18:08.415 --> 18:11.964
...you be strong for Sonja, all right?
That's what she would've wanted.

18:12.415 --> 18:14.292
She was talking about you
the other day.

18:14.455 --> 18:17.811
She said she cut your name
out of the paper.

18:23.175 --> 18:26.850
- Take care of your dad.
- Yeah, he'll be all right.

18:28.055 --> 18:30.046
Excuse me a second.

18:32.655 --> 18:34.566
See if you can reach
this Jimmy Madlow...

18:34.735 --> 18:36.885
...before these people
leave the station house.

18:37.055 --> 18:39.853
- You didn't like the brother's answer?
- It's probably okay...

18:40.015 --> 18:42.131
...but I'd like to talk to Madlow...

18:42.295 --> 18:44.525
...before him and Ernie
get their heads together.

18:44.695 --> 18:47.846
- I'll call you when we pick him up.
- Yeah.

18:55.815 --> 18:58.249
- Wanna hit the gym, lieu?
- No, I gotta get home.

18:58.455 --> 19:00.605
- I'm gonna get those gloves on you.
- All right.

19:00.775 --> 19:02.652
- Night, Bob.
- Night, James.

19:04.775 --> 19:06.970
So Lesniak is sitting on your witness?

19:07.455 --> 19:10.174
We'll look to grab up this Arnold Glover
tomorrow morning...

19:10.375 --> 19:12.172
...when he gets back
from Atlantic City.

19:12.335 --> 19:14.371
What do you make
of her changing her story?

19:14.535 --> 19:17.208
Well, the only thing was
the guy seeing her.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.889
- Changing her story on the guy is big.
- Yeah.

19:20.055 --> 19:22.285
I don't wanna get down the road
and have her...

19:22.455 --> 19:24.491
...telling us she knows
where Jimmy Hoffa is.

19:24.695 --> 19:27.448
Well, I don't know, lieu,
that'd be a nice case to clear.

19:27.615 --> 19:29.685
- Good night.
- Good night, lieutenant.

19:31.455 --> 19:33.844
- So how'd it go today?
- Oh, it went fine, detective.

19:34.015 --> 19:36.688
- I feel very settled in.
- That's good.

19:36.855 --> 19:37.970
SIMONE: Good night, guys.
- Yeah.

19:38.175 --> 19:40.325
- Good night, detective.
- Good night, Bobby.

19:40.495 --> 19:42.725
Of course, you don't wanna get
too settled in.

19:43.375 --> 19:46.094
No, I understand
Miss Abandando is expected back.

19:46.295 --> 19:50.573
You probably don't wanna be using
her clerical materials or so forth.

19:52.215 --> 19:55.571
No, we're all very particular
about that kind of thing.

19:55.775 --> 19:59.654
Yeah, because she's definitely
expected back.

20:24.815 --> 20:26.726
MAN:
Here you go.

20:27.055 --> 20:29.125
Arnold Glover?

20:30.775 --> 20:34.085
- What's up?
- There was an accident involving your ex.

20:34.255 --> 20:36.485
Let's go to the station house.
We'll fill you in.

20:36.695 --> 20:40.165
I'm not interested in what you know.
I don't care what happened to my ex.

20:40.335 --> 20:42.246
Well, let's go
to the station house anyway.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.849
I was in Atlantic City.
I got nothing to say to you.

20:45.055 --> 20:46.932
Look, Arnold, what do you wanna do?

20:47.095 --> 20:50.007
You wanna go like a gentleman
or skell, huh?

20:50.175 --> 20:52.609
You want me to cuff you
and throw your ass in the car?

20:52.775 --> 20:54.652
My lawyer's Doris Kaplan.

20:55.135 --> 20:58.252
Yeah, we know Doris.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

21:07.735 --> 21:08.135
- How'd we do on those junkies?
- I'm gonna talk to the last one.

21:08.135 --> 21:10.603
- How'd we do on those junkies?
- I'm gonna talk to the last one.

21:10.775 --> 21:14.324
The other two alibied out.
The guy you know is in Interview 2.

21:14.495 --> 21:16.565
- Jimmy Madlow.
- Yeah, there's no warrant.

21:16.735 --> 21:18.965
We couldn't grab him up
till he left his house...

21:19.175 --> 21:22.690
...but I doubt he's talked to Ernie
because his phone's been disconnected.

21:22.855 --> 21:24.083
What's he think it's about?

21:24.255 --> 21:27.053
We told him his plates
got reported in a car accident.

21:31.615 --> 21:34.607
- Andy?
- How's it going, Jimmy?

21:34.815 --> 21:38.603
They got me in here for some traffic
accident I don't know nothing about.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.572
You're in this precinct now?

21:40.735 --> 21:44.045
Why don't you talk with James,
detective. Maybe you can clear this up.

21:44.255 --> 21:47.053
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

21:49.735 --> 21:52.886
- How's it going, Andy. How you been?
- Okay, Socks.

21:53.535 --> 21:58.404
Socks. You're the only person
who still calls me Socks.

21:58.615 --> 22:00.253
I've been okay recently.

22:00.415 --> 22:02.883
I had a few speed bumps
with the law five years ago.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.046
I don't know anything
what this is about.

22:05.575 --> 22:10.205
- When did you see the Neibergs last?
- The candy store people?

22:10.655 --> 22:13.328
- Gee, it's been a while.
- How long?

22:14.575 --> 22:17.373
- What's going on? What's this about?
- Answer my question.

22:18.615 --> 22:21.846
I'm gonna guess two years.

22:22.855 --> 22:26.814
Am I in here for a traffic accident?
What the hell am I in here for, Andy?

22:26.975 --> 22:30.729
Sonja Neiberg got shot
in a stickup, Socks.

22:30.895 --> 22:34.490
- You're kidding me.
- She's dead.

22:34.855 --> 22:38.564
Well, you spoke to Moe and the boys.
They must be sick.

22:38.735 --> 22:41.010
Your fingerprints are on a counter
in that store.

22:41.615 --> 22:41.735
Hey, your fingerprints are probably
on that counter from when we was kids.

22:41.735 --> 22:45.011
Hey, your fingerprints are probably
on that counter from when we was kids.

22:45.215 --> 22:47.490
Those prints aren't from
when we were kids.

22:47.655 --> 22:49.725
Sonja wiped that counter down
every night.

22:50.135 --> 22:52.603
Oh, come on, Andy.
You're talking about Sonja and Moe.

22:52.775 --> 22:55.892
You're talking about David and Ernie.
Those are people I care about.

22:56.095 --> 22:59.610
I don't like how this is going, Jimmy.

23:01.215 --> 23:06.448
I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
and explain why I didn't previously.

23:06.615 --> 23:09.368
I was in there three nights ago.

23:09.575 --> 23:12.692
Now, listen to me, listen to me.
This is why I was reluctant to say.

23:12.855 --> 23:16.894
I got a record, Andy. I can't afford
to get in trouble on things.

23:18.775 --> 23:22.245
Why would you get in trouble
for saying you were in that store?

23:23.775 --> 23:25.128
Hm?

23:32.495 --> 23:34.406
All right, all right.

23:34.575 --> 23:37.043
Here's the absolute truth.

23:37.215 --> 23:39.695
I did stop by there three nights ago
to say hello to Ernie.

23:39.695 --> 23:40.172
I did stop by there three nights ago
to say hello to Ernie.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.166
That's how my prints
got on the counter.

23:42.375 --> 23:45.128
- Why'd you stop?
- I saw his car out front.

23:45.455 --> 23:48.731
How do you know
what kind of car he drives?

23:52.055 --> 23:54.523
Oh, my God.

23:56.815 --> 23:58.851
Oh, my God.

24:02.575 --> 24:06.011
Did you go meet him three nights ago
and come back yesterday, Socks?

24:06.375 --> 24:10.209
Andy, on my mother's eyes, I swear,
I'd never do anything like this.

24:10.935 --> 24:12.846
Do you remember
my catcher's mitt, Socks?

24:13.015 --> 24:14.414
What are you talking about?

24:14.615 --> 24:18.403
You remember my new catcher's mitt
showing up in your locker at school?

24:18.615 --> 24:21.493
Why are you bringing that up?
I never knew how that got there.

24:21.695 --> 24:24.414
You swore on your mother's eyes
then too.

24:24.575 --> 24:27.772
Something happened in that store,
and you were involved in it.

24:27.975 --> 24:33.049
Look in my eyes. Now, you tell me.
You are gonna tell me.

24:33.255 --> 24:36.167
Let's get it over with.

24:40.535 --> 24:43.572
JOHN: Okay. Bye-bye.
- Good morning.

24:43.735 --> 24:45.566
- Good morning.
- Where's Detective Simone?

24:45.735 --> 24:47.532
In the locker room.

24:47.735 --> 24:50.044
The locker's unisex.

24:51.255 --> 24:53.644
SIMONE: Hey.
LESNIAK: Good morning.

24:55.335 --> 24:58.611
- Is she going to a party afterwards?
- She's kind of a strange broad.

24:58.815 --> 25:00.373
SIMONE: Yeah?
LESNIAK: She seems pleasant...

25:00.535 --> 25:03.333
...and then you get
a big Leona Helmsley hit.

25:03.495 --> 25:06.851
Well, we brought the suspect in.
James and Greg are setting the lineup.

25:07.015 --> 25:09.324
We'll see how it goes.
Thanks for sitting with her.

25:09.495 --> 25:11.690
- No problem.
- How's it going today, Miss Novak?

25:11.855 --> 25:13.413
So you brought in a suspect.

25:13.575 --> 25:15.770
We'll run a lineup,
see if you recognize anyone.

25:15.935 --> 25:19.723
Come on in here and have a seat.
I'll explain to you how it goes.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.654
You're wrong about flowers.
They'd brighten up your desk.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.652
I'll bring you in some.

25:25.415 --> 25:27.246
SIMONE:
So...

25:28.175 --> 25:30.484
...there'll be six people sitting in a room.

25:30.655 --> 25:33.772
They won't be able to see you.
So you can get close to the window.

25:34.175 --> 25:35.369
- I'll be in there.
- Good.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.173
So will my boss, the ADA...

25:37.335 --> 25:40.611
...and a defense attorney. I'm not
looking to coach you, Miss Novak...

25:40.815 --> 25:43.773
If you don't start calling me Joyce,
I'm out of here.

25:44.775 --> 25:47.448
Okay. I'm not looking
to coach you, Joyce.

25:47.975 --> 25:51.490
I need you to understand the legalities,
where if a witness says:

25:51.655 --> 25:54.374
"This might be the person,"
or, "Maybe that was him"...

25:54.535 --> 25:57.254
...that's as good as saying,
"I didn't recognize anybody."

25:57.415 --> 26:00.691
- No if, ands or buts.
- No if, ands or buts. That's right.

26:00.855 --> 26:03.164
We should be set up
to go in a little while.

26:03.335 --> 26:04.927
Can I get you something to drink?

26:05.095 --> 26:08.724
Is the coffee here as yummy
as that instant in my motel room?

26:08.895 --> 26:11.489
Yeah, those places really
aren't the Ritz, are they?

26:11.655 --> 26:15.443
- How do you take it?
- I'll come with you. I'll fix it myself.

26:15.615 --> 26:19.051
SIMONE: Did you sleep all right?
NOVAK: My first pajama party in a while.

26:19.215 --> 26:21.206
Does Detective Lesniak snore?

26:21.895 --> 26:24.489
I thought maybe you'd know.

26:24.655 --> 26:29.206
No. We've never guarded
a material witness together.

26:31.015 --> 26:33.688
So am I the only person
who saw your suspect?

26:33.895 --> 26:36.125
I'm not allowed to answer that.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.650
I know these people were shot.

26:38.815 --> 26:43.650
Would it be better if instead of seeing
a bag, I saw him carrying a gun?

26:47.735 --> 26:49.293
Did you see him carrying a gun?

26:49.895 --> 26:52.284
I might've seen a gun
if it makes it easier for you.

26:52.455 --> 26:54.525
The only thing that will
make my job easier...

26:54.695 --> 26:57.767
...is you saying the truth.
Lying could jeopardize this whole case.

26:57.935 --> 26:59.448
- Don't be angry with me.
- I'm not.

26:59.615 --> 27:03.290
- I'm just trying to help.
- That doesn't help, making things up.

27:04.615 --> 27:07.049
You know, I put myself
to considerable trouble here.

27:07.455 --> 27:09.286
I know you have, and I appreciate that.

27:09.455 --> 27:13.084
It might be considerable trouble
and risk continuing to cooperate.

27:16.455 --> 27:18.252
Yeah.

27:20.295 --> 27:23.651
Well, that's why I wanna keep this
as straightforward as possible here.

27:23.815 --> 27:26.613
Okay? No embellishing
on anything. Here.

27:26.775 --> 27:27.969
[KNOCKING]

27:28.135 --> 27:30.603
Oh, we got the fillers, Bobby.
We're ready when you are.

27:30.775 --> 27:34.450
- Well, I'm not sure I'm ready.
- Just give us a second here, Greg.

27:34.615 --> 27:36.128
Sure.

27:36.615 --> 27:39.083
What's up? You wanna take a minute?

27:39.255 --> 27:42.452
- I'm not sure I want to do this at all.
- Let's try and calm down here.

27:42.655 --> 27:46.250
I'm perfectly calm. I'm just not sure
I wanna put myself through all this.

27:52.895 --> 27:56.774
All right, I'll tell you what.
Let's put the lineup off for a little while.

27:56.935 --> 28:00.769
Why don't you and me go
and have a little lunch.

28:00.935 --> 28:03.403
Try to sort all this out.

28:03.575 --> 28:07.329
And if you feel up to it afterwards,
we can run the lineup.

28:08.735 --> 28:10.532
All right.

28:11.695 --> 28:13.367
Let's sort it out.

28:13.535 --> 28:18.086
Okay. Let me just talk to my boss,
and then we're out of here.

28:22.455 --> 28:24.366
Okay, here we go.

28:24.535 --> 28:27.527
Lieu, can I talk to you for a second?

28:28.255 --> 28:30.769
I'll be in the coffee room.

28:33.895 --> 28:36.887
- We got more problems with her.
- She changed her story again?

28:37.535 --> 28:39.093
She offered to.

28:39.255 --> 28:42.133
Now look, I know she saw this guy.
I know she can pick him out.

28:42.295 --> 28:44.525
I've just gotta hold her together.

28:44.695 --> 28:47.084
So I wanna stall the lineup,
take her for some food.

28:47.255 --> 28:51.134
I don't want you in a position where
she can lie about what you did or said.

28:51.295 --> 28:52.887
I've gotta take her myself.

28:53.255 --> 28:57.806
- That's what she's looking for?
- I can handle it. She's not that bad.

28:57.975 --> 29:00.773
Lieu, she's our only witness.

29:11.135 --> 29:13.365
Miss Novak was saying
this lineup was postponed?

29:13.535 --> 29:15.605
We're having a little trouble
finding fillers.

29:15.775 --> 29:17.925
So I thought I'd take Joyce
out for a quick lunch. You ready?

29:18.095 --> 29:20.006
NOVAK:
Mm-hm.

29:25.735 --> 29:28.613
Yeah, thanks.

29:29.455 --> 29:32.527
Ernie Neiberg's on his way up.

29:33.575 --> 29:37.409
- Hey, sure you wanna do this?
- Do I look like I wanna do it?

29:38.055 --> 29:40.330
I'm just saying maybe
I should take the interview.

29:40.495 --> 29:43.134
No, I gotta do it.

29:44.335 --> 29:48.294
- Hey, Andy. Detective.
- How's it going, Mr. Neiberg?

29:49.215 --> 29:52.013
What'd you need to talk to me about?

29:52.175 --> 29:54.484
Let's go in there.

29:59.535 --> 30:03.210
My dad's lousy.
I wanna get back as soon as I can.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.252
Yeah?

30:05.415 --> 30:08.691
You're worried about your dad?
You're worried about him?

30:10.375 --> 30:14.573
We gotta figure how to take care of your
dad, Ernie, because Socks gave it up.

30:15.215 --> 30:17.934
- What are you saying?
- What do you mean, "What am I saying?"

30:18.095 --> 30:22.725
Socks gave it up. Him doing the stickup,
and you putting him up to it.

30:22.895 --> 30:25.489
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:25.655 --> 30:28.647
You gonna stand there,
and you gonna lie to me?

30:28.815 --> 30:33.684
I know you didn't want
your mother to be hurt.

30:33.855 --> 30:36.085
You get ready to tell me the truth.

30:36.255 --> 30:42.012
Then we gotta figure out how to keep
your father alive when he hears this.

31:06.335 --> 31:09.088
You know, I would've sprang
for a sit-down.

31:09.255 --> 31:11.485
I like hot dogs.

31:11.655 --> 31:14.294
"The Umbrella Cafe."

31:15.455 --> 31:17.207
Let's go sit over there.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.333
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

31:20.575 --> 31:23.135
I'm glad we got out.

31:24.655 --> 31:27.727
You know, there's some things
that I wanted to tell you today...

31:27.895 --> 31:31.410
...I really couldn't say
in the station house...

31:31.575 --> 31:34.692
...in terms of some feelings
that I may have.

31:36.135 --> 31:37.932
What kind of feelings?

31:40.495 --> 31:43.407
Joyce, when I'm on a case,
no matter how I may begin to feel...

31:43.575 --> 31:46.089
...about somebody on a personal level...

31:46.255 --> 31:50.089
...as hard as that may be for me, I gotta
put those personal feelings to the side.

31:50.295 --> 31:52.206
They don't let you have a personal life?

31:52.375 --> 31:55.492
You gotta understand if the defense
proves there's a relationship...

31:55.655 --> 31:59.045
...between a witness and a detective,
your credibility's shot. So is mine.

31:59.215 --> 32:01.365
Well, they might suggest collusion.

32:01.535 --> 32:03.526
Collusion, exactly.

32:04.975 --> 32:08.445
My boss, he's already uncomfortable
about the two of us.

32:08.615 --> 32:12.494
He senses something. He's thinking
about taking me off the case.

32:12.655 --> 32:16.534
- I don't want that.
- I don't want that either, Joyce.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.533
That's why we have to keep this
on a professional level.

32:20.255 --> 32:23.406
You know, this whole thing,
it'll be over inside of a year.

32:25.575 --> 32:27.452
So you do have feelings for me?

32:27.655 --> 32:31.853
I won't talk about my personal feelings
at this point, okay?

32:32.015 --> 32:33.733
I don't wanna presume what yours are.

32:33.935 --> 32:36.244
- While the case is going on.
- That's right.

32:36.415 --> 32:38.849
- But afterward?
- That's a whole different ball game.

32:39.335 --> 32:42.088
Then I can say
how I really feel about you.

32:44.135 --> 32:45.807
All right.

32:45.975 --> 32:48.170
- I understand.
- Do you?

32:48.335 --> 32:50.007
Yeah.

32:51.775 --> 32:54.369
How do you feel about the lineup?

32:54.535 --> 32:56.366
You ready to go back in yet?

32:56.535 --> 32:59.686
- You'll be with me?
- I'll be standing there right next to you.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.294
What am I gonna do, Andy?

33:16.455 --> 33:18.650
What am I gonna do?

33:18.815 --> 33:21.204
Maybe you should just
put a bullet in my head.

33:21.375 --> 33:25.254
Ernie, let's get through this. Sit down.

33:30.735 --> 33:33.772
My father was supposed
to be there, all right?

33:33.935 --> 33:36.290
My father was supposed to be there.

33:36.455 --> 33:39.527
He always said he'd give it up.
I don't know if you remember that.

33:39.735 --> 33:41.805
- Yeah.
- "If they can take the cash register...

33:41.975 --> 33:45.012
...on their back,
let them take it," he says.

33:45.415 --> 33:46.973
But...

33:48.935 --> 33:53.690
...he had pains in his chest.
So Mom made him go home.

33:53.855 --> 33:59.088
And so it was her behind the counter.
She was not supposed to be there.

34:00.135 --> 34:02.251
I don't know why Socks
had a loaded gun.

34:02.415 --> 34:05.771
He said it was to back people off,
and he slipped when she swung the bat.

34:05.935 --> 34:08.768
Well, that is not good enough, okay?
That's no excuse.

34:08.935 --> 34:11.051
There was not supposed to be violence.

34:11.775 --> 34:14.733
They were gonna take the store, Andy.

34:15.295 --> 34:17.855
I owed shylocks.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.654
- I couldn't go to my folks again.
- But you could rob them?

34:20.815 --> 34:23.693
Four or five thousand
would've backed them off.

34:23.855 --> 34:27.005
You gotta write it down, Ernie.

34:30.295 --> 34:32.172
So...

34:33.375 --> 34:37.414
...is this some kind
of a manslaughter type thing?

34:37.574 --> 34:40.612
- Some kind of an involuntary type thing?
- Write up a statement.

34:40.775 --> 34:43.447
They'll figure out a charge.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.969
Now on your dad...

34:46.935 --> 34:49.529
...you wanna talk to him
if they'll let me take you over?

34:49.735 --> 34:52.295
I can't face him. You...

34:52.455 --> 34:56.414
I can't see him.
You tell him what happened.

34:56.574 --> 34:58.884
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

35:02.015 --> 35:06.964
But on the charge, they might
go for something involuntary?

35:22.575 --> 35:25.772
- Do you recognize anyone, Miss Novak?
- Yes, number four.

35:25.935 --> 35:27.926
SIMONE: Where do you recognize
number four from?

35:28.135 --> 35:30.171
I saw him yesterday at about 9: 15 a. M...

35:30.335 --> 35:32.610
...running through the alley
outside my apartment.

35:32.815 --> 35:34.931
He had a brown paper bag
in his right hand.

35:35.135 --> 35:37.933
And he threw the bag into a trash can.

35:38.095 --> 35:39.733
SIMONE:
Everyone but number four can go.

35:39.895 --> 35:42.728
<i>Everybody but number four.</i>

35:42.935 --> 35:44.926
KAPLAN: I'd like to see my client.
FANCY: Go ahead.

35:45.495 --> 35:47.372
OFFICER:
<i>All right.</i>

35:47.655 --> 35:50.215
<i>Okay, thank you, everybody.</i>
<i>You can go now. Right this...</i>

35:52.775 --> 35:54.735
Has Detective Simone
walked you through the next days?

35:54.735 --> 35:55.212
Has Detective Simone
walked you through the next days?

35:55.375 --> 35:58.924
Whether or not they deal, you gotta
testify before the jury within 72 hours.

35:59.095 --> 36:01.006
- You think they might deal?
- It's possible.

36:01.215 --> 36:03.285
The more quickly
this is resolved, the better.

36:03.455 --> 36:04.683
I understand your feelings.

36:04.895 --> 36:07.204
- You'll hold him in custody now?
- Yeah.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.331
Then I'd like to move back
to my apartment.

36:09.495 --> 36:11.167
I think that makes sense.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.168
I don't have a car.
Can Detective Simone take me home?

36:14.775 --> 36:16.731
Yeah.

36:19.495 --> 36:21.406
Here we go.

36:53.215 --> 36:55.331
Come to arrest me, Andy?

36:55.495 --> 36:58.885
- Make me go to the funeral home?
- Moe, a few things have developed.

37:00.655 --> 37:03.727
- With who killed her?
- Jimmy Madlow.

37:03.895 --> 37:07.934
- We found his print on the counter.
- Jimmy Madlow?

37:08.095 --> 37:10.404
- He did it?
- Sit down, Pop.

37:14.095 --> 37:16.563
Ernie's talked to me, Moe.

37:16.735 --> 37:20.614
He said he put Jimmy up to it.
We had to take Ernie into custody.

37:29.535 --> 37:33.414
It was the gambling. It was the bets.

37:33.615 --> 37:35.492
SIPOWICZ:
Moe...

37:36.615 --> 37:40.733
...I want you to know
that Ernie came to me.

37:40.895 --> 37:43.932
He came forward on his own.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.813
He did?

37:45.975 --> 37:49.047
He never wanted this to happen.

37:49.215 --> 37:52.366
What'll they do to my son, Ernie?

37:52.535 --> 37:54.491
He's locked up.

37:54.655 --> 37:58.364
- Forever? He'll never get out of jail?
- It's not settled yet, Moe.

37:58.895 --> 38:01.932
For all his life people did for him.
That's why this has happened.

38:02.095 --> 38:04.086
So it's not his fault, right, Dad?

38:04.775 --> 38:08.450
Because everyone did for him
his whole life, this isn't his fault either?

38:08.615 --> 38:11.766
- He killed Ma!
- He didn't pull the trigger.

38:11.975 --> 38:14.773
- Ma's dead.
- David...

38:14.935 --> 38:17.733
...I know you wanna take care
of your dad now, right?

38:17.935 --> 38:21.325
Maybe help him lie down.

38:28.575 --> 38:34.252
Yeah, Dad, let's go home. Come on.

38:35.495 --> 38:37.929
SIPOWICZ:
Why don't you give me the keys?

38:38.135 --> 38:40.490
I'll close the store.

38:48.015 --> 38:50.245
I won't go to the funeral home yet.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.930
No one's asking you to go
to the funeral home, Dad.

38:54.815 --> 38:56.965
I won't see Ernie yet.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.605
All right. All right, whatever you decide.

39:00.775 --> 39:03.335
MOE:
Or if I do see him...

39:03.495 --> 39:05.850
...don't ask me to forgive him yet.

39:29.535 --> 39:33.050
Yeah, this all looks okay too.

39:35.655 --> 39:39.330
- Thanks for the ride.
- Sure.

39:39.855 --> 39:43.131
So can I be your chauffeur
at the grand jury too?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.046
You're hired.

39:46.215 --> 39:47.728
I'm hired, huh?

39:48.415 --> 39:51.885
- You know one of my best qualities?
- What's that?

39:52.055 --> 39:54.967
I know how to keep a secret.

39:55.215 --> 39:57.775
- Mm-hm.
- Uh-huh.

39:58.295 --> 40:00.286
We're here alone.

40:00.455 --> 40:02.923
- I won't tell if you won't.
- We can't do this, Joyce.

40:03.095 --> 40:06.087
- Why? Don't you think you can trust me?
- No, it's not that.

40:06.255 --> 40:08.007
Do you think I'd get you into trouble?

40:08.415 --> 40:11.407
Accuse you of something
if you didn't do what I wanted?

40:11.575 --> 40:15.807
- You think I'd blow your case?
- Look, we're not gonna do anything here.

40:15.975 --> 40:20.332
All right? Nothing's gonna happen.

40:21.775 --> 40:25.165
I need for you to understand that.
I need for you to work with me on this.

40:25.335 --> 40:29.692
- Or I just... Look, I gotta walk.
- Wait, wait, wait.

40:31.655 --> 40:33.964
I'll work with you.

40:34.135 --> 40:36.888
We'll find a way to work it out.

40:37.055 --> 40:39.933
- Good. That's good.
- Don't go yet.

40:40.095 --> 40:43.565
- No. Really, l...
- No, just a second.

40:51.495 --> 40:55.932
- Can I put that on my desk?
- That's what it's for.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.730
That's great.

41:00.615 --> 41:02.367
It's great.

41:02.535 --> 41:05.891
So I'll talk to you later then, huh?

41:06.055 --> 41:07.852
Good.

41:08.295 --> 41:11.253
I'll let you know about the grand jury.

41:29.615 --> 41:33.608
- What's going on?
- How's your Brooklyn situation?

41:33.775 --> 41:36.335
It's done. How's our
Manhattan situation?

41:36.495 --> 41:39.726
Detective Simone's witness made an ID
in that double homicide.

41:39.935 --> 41:42.893
I think he's in the locker room.

41:50.415 --> 41:52.531
Hey, how's it going?

41:52.695 --> 41:56.529
I'm gonna do a 4 to 1,
make up for the day.

41:57.095 --> 41:59.529
That case went down.

41:59.695 --> 42:02.255
That dead woman.

42:03.935 --> 42:07.689
- These are your friends in Brooklyn?
- One of the boys set it up.

42:07.855 --> 42:09.732
One of her sons.

42:09.895 --> 42:14.286
- He set up a stickup, and it went bad.
- I'm sorry, man.

42:14.455 --> 42:16.685
That homo out there
said you collared up.

42:18.495 --> 42:21.248
- What a head case my witness is.
- Oh, yeah?

42:21.415 --> 42:24.775
Yeah. Horny, mean, three-quarters nuts.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.128
Yeah. Horny, mean, three-quarters nuts.

42:26.295 --> 42:28.684
Meet her on the outside,
you'd think she was a catch.

42:28.895 --> 42:34.253
Yeah, this is a great job.
You get to see people at their best.

42:34.895 --> 42:39.764
If this family had to deal with a cop,
Andy, they're probably glad it was you.

42:41.255 --> 42:44.884
There are few enough things
you'd like to keep how they were.

42:45.055 --> 42:47.933
That candy store would've
been one of them.

42:49.495 --> 42:51.451
Good night.

42:53.335 --> 42:55.326
Good night.

42:55.895 --> 42:57.647
[DOOR CLOSES]

43:06.415 --> 43:10.124
- Is Detective Simone gone?
- Yeah, he just walked out.

43:10.295 --> 43:14.083
He's left. Can I have
another detective help you?

43:14.255 --> 43:17.486
No, I can't give that information out.

43:17.655 --> 43:21.364
You can try him here tomorrow.
He's doing an 8 to 4.

43:21.535 --> 43:23.526
All right.

43:26.215 --> 43:28.445
Personal call.
