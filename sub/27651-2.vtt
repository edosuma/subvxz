00:12.205 --> 00:13.645
[Alec] Okay, I've made

00:12.205 --> 00:13.645
yours spicy, yeah?

00:14.925 --> 00:16.925
Bhaji? No worries,

00:14.925 --> 00:16.925
thank you.

00:16.965 --> 00:19.765
[Fred]<i> Many of us dream</i>

00:16.965 --> 00:19.765

00:19.805 --> 00:22.005
Duck wrap? Yep.

00:19.805 --> 00:22.005
Hot one? Yep.

00:22.045 --> 00:25.645
<i>But some people</i>

00:22.045 --> 00:25.645
<i>are determined</i>

00:22.045 --> 00:25.645
<i>to make it a reality.</i>

00:25.685 --> 00:26.605
Thank you.

00:26.645 --> 00:28.965
There's nothing like this

00:26.645 --> 00:28.965
out there.

00:29.005 --> 00:31.445
We left our jobs

00:29.005 --> 00:31.445
to follow our dream.

00:31.485 --> 00:33.605
I want to be

00:31.485 --> 00:33.605
the Nando's of duck.

00:33.645 --> 00:35.085
[Fred]<i> It's such</i>

00:44.245 --> 00:46.365
Over the next six weeks

00:51.085 --> 00:54.565
Here in Manchester,

01:08.925 --> 01:11.565
I like businesses

01:08.925 --> 01:11.565
"That's almost great..."

01:11.605 --> 01:13.125
[Lacey]

01:11.605 --> 01:13.125

01:13.165 --> 01:15.005
"...but I can make it

01:13.165 --> 01:15.005
really great."

01:15.045 --> 01:16.245
We need a pork belly.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.045
It is tough out there,

01:18.085 --> 01:20.925
but businesses that offer

01:18.085 --> 01:20.925
the customer something

01:18.085 --> 01:20.925
different are thriving.

01:20.965 --> 01:22.925
Table nine, please,

01:20.965 --> 01:22.925
how long?

01:22.965 --> 01:25.645
If the business plan is right,

01:22.965 --> 01:25.645
I'll fight to invest.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.245
[both] Service!

We've got Â£350,000

01:39.325 --> 01:42.885
riding on this lunch service.

01:42.925 --> 01:46.325
When the kitchen closes,

01:42.925 --> 01:46.325
will the investors

01:42.925 --> 01:46.325
make them an offer?

01:46.365 --> 01:47.885
Everything's riding on it now.

01:47.925 --> 01:50.725
The doors are open

02:19.925 --> 02:24.525
Today, three ideas

02:19.925 --> 02:24.525

<i>Today, they're looking</i>

02:30.045 --> 02:32.765
<i>for just one.</i>

02:32.805 --> 02:35.485
It's a burger and chips,

02:32.805 --> 02:35.485
Indian-style.

02:35.525 --> 02:39.205
[Fred]<i> The most promising</i>

02:59.245 --> 03:02.685
pork mince, chili

02:59.245 --> 03:02.685
and basil stir-fry.

03:02.725 --> 03:04.325
All right? Taste it.

03:04.365 --> 03:08.845
[Fred]<i> Young chefs</i>

03:04.365 --> 03:08.845
<i>Joe and Aaron,</i>

03:08.885 --> 03:12.525
<i>of Nepalese and Indian.</i>

03:12.565 --> 03:14.805
-So tasty.

03:12.565 --> 03:14.805
That's properly spiced.

03:12.565 --> 03:14.805
-Yeah.

03:14.845 --> 03:17.165
[Alec] If you can

03:14.845 --> 03:17.165
get me some water.

03:17.205 --> 03:19.405
[Fred]

03:17.205 --> 03:19.405
<i>And couple Liz and Alec,</i>

03:19.445 --> 03:22.525

<i>to reinvent the burger</i>

03:22.565 --> 03:25.445
<i>at their street stall Baba G's.</i>

03:25.485 --> 03:29.285
The key to a good patty

03:25.485 --> 03:29.285
is getting the right amount

03:25.485 --> 03:29.285
of flavor and salt and spice.

03:33.085 --> 03:34.445
-Morning.

03:33.085 --> 03:34.445
-[all] Morning.

03:34.485 --> 03:35.685
How are you feeling?

03:35.725 --> 03:37.205
Little bit nervous, but...

03:37.245 --> 03:39.725
If you were not nervous

03:37.245 --> 03:39.725
I would actually

03:37.245 --> 03:39.725
be very worried.

03:39.765 --> 03:42.405
It's a big day today,

03:39.765 --> 03:42.405
you know, it's an amazing

03:39.765 --> 03:42.405
opportunity that you have.

03:42.445 --> 03:44.045
I mean, you are going

03:42.445 --> 03:44.045
to be in front of four

03:44.085 --> 03:46.325
of the leading investors

03:44.085 --> 03:46.325
in this industry, you know.

03:46.365 --> 03:48.045
So it's a chance

03:46.365 --> 03:48.045
of a lifetime.

03:48.085 --> 03:51.845
The investors can

03:48.085 --> 03:51.845
only choose one of you

03:48.085 --> 03:51.845
to go to Manchester.

03:51.885 --> 03:55.485
They're going to choose

03:51.885 --> 03:55.485
the idea that has the most

03:51.885 --> 03:55.485
investment potential.

03:55.525 --> 03:57.125
Good luck. Get cooking.

03:57.165 --> 03:59.365
[all] Thank you.

-Morning.

04:07.885 --> 04:09.245
-How are you guys?

04:09.285 --> 04:10.285
-Very well.

04:09.285 --> 04:10.285
-Very good.

04:10.325 --> 04:12.205
We've got a very

04:10.325 --> 04:12.205
exciting day ahead.

04:12.245 --> 04:14.965
We are about to see

04:12.245 --> 04:14.965
and taste three operators

04:15.005 --> 04:19.765
who believe their twist

04:15.005 --> 04:19.765
on Asian food will get people

04:15.005 --> 04:19.765
queuing for a table.

04:19.805 --> 04:23.245
I mean, what is so interesting,

04:19.805 --> 04:23.245
what's so exciting

04:19.805 --> 04:23.245
about this sector?

04:23.285 --> 04:24.765
For the last 50 years,

04:24.805 --> 04:26.405
if you went to

04:24.805 --> 04:26.405
any Indian restaurant

04:24.805 --> 04:26.405
on the high street

04:26.445 --> 04:27.845
or any Chinese restaurant

04:26.445 --> 04:27.845
on the high street,

04:27.885 --> 04:29.365
the menus were interchangeable.

04:29.405 --> 04:31.645
And now suddenly,

04:29.405 --> 04:31.645
young people in particular

04:31.685 --> 04:33.965
are getting interested

04:31.685 --> 04:33.965
in regional cuisine.

04:34.005 --> 04:35.525
My name is Charlie McVeigh,

04:35.565 --> 04:38.125
I've been in the pub

04:35.565 --> 04:38.125
and restaurant business

04:35.565 --> 04:38.125
for 20 years.

04:38.165 --> 04:40.085
I sold a group of 16 pubs

04:38.165 --> 04:40.085
a year ago.

04:40.125 --> 04:41.805
<i>I know how</i>

04:40.125 --> 04:41.805
<i>to develop a brand,</i>

04:41.845 --> 04:44.765
<i>and, most importantly,</i>

04:41.845 --> 04:44.765
<i>I know how to make money.</i>

04:44.805 --> 04:47.405
Gone are the days where

04:44.805 --> 04:47.405
you can just have

04:44.805 --> 04:47.405
a generic Asian restaurant.

04:47.445 --> 04:49.685
I think people want to

04:47.445 --> 04:49.685
kind of understand

04:47.445 --> 04:49.685
the cultures behind it,

04:49.725 --> 04:51.525
the regions that certain

04:49.725 --> 04:51.525
dishes come from.

04:51.565 --> 04:55.365
I'm Jamie Barber.

04:51.565 --> 04:55.365
I've opened dozens of

04:51.565 --> 04:55.365
restaurants over my career.

04:55.405 --> 04:58.245
<i>I wanna see a concept</i>

04:55.405 --> 04:58.245
<i>that's unique</i>

04:58.285 --> 05:00.285
<i>and differentiated</i>

04:58.285 --> 05:00.285
<i>but also mass appealing.</i>

05:00.325 --> 05:01.885
I think that

05:00.325 --> 05:01.885
could be quite exciting.

05:01.925 --> 05:05.525
One of the great things

05:01.925 --> 05:05.525
about Asian food

05:01.925 --> 05:05.525
has been the margin.

05:05.565 --> 05:07.965
So rice-based,

05:05.565 --> 05:07.965
noodle-based.

05:08.005 --> 05:10.365
<i>A pad thai can cost</i>

05:08.005 --> 05:10.365
<i>as little as 20p to make,</i>

05:10.405 --> 05:12.245
and yet you can sell it

05:10.405 --> 05:12.245
for seven or eight quid.

05:12.285 --> 05:14.005
<i>And hopefully today,</i>

05:12.285 --> 05:14.005
<i>we'll be thinking,</i>

05:14.045 --> 05:16.325
"Wow, we can really

05:14.045 --> 05:16.325
make some money here,"

05:14.045 --> 05:16.325
which will be great.

05:16.365 --> 05:20.085
[Paul] 74 and 75.

05:16.365 --> 05:20.085
There you go, gents.

05:20.125 --> 05:24.525
[Fred]<i> First to pitch</i>

05:24.565 --> 05:26.845
Thank you. There's

05:24.565 --> 05:26.845
your order number, 79.

05:26.885 --> 05:29.045
[Fred]<i> They run</i>

05:29.085 --> 05:33.765
<i>to the high street.</i>

05:33.805 --> 05:36.365
People know pad thai

05:33.805 --> 05:36.365
and they know green curry.

05:36.405 --> 05:37.605
That's not what it's about.

05:37.645 --> 05:39.405
Chicken and rice,

05:37.645 --> 05:39.405
sriracha mayo, number 11.

05:39.445 --> 05:42.565
We've literally sacrificed

05:39.445 --> 05:42.565
everything for this.

05:42.605 --> 05:46.125
<i>I quit my job in finance</i>

05:42.605 --> 05:46.125
<i>to do this full-time</i>

05:46.165 --> 05:50.285
and decided that

05:46.165 --> 05:50.285
it was a really good idea

05:46.165 --> 05:50.285
to buy a house,

05:50.325 --> 05:53.925
get married, have a child

05:50.325 --> 05:53.925
in the space of six months.

05:53.965 --> 05:57.165
<i>This is literally putting</i>

05:53.965 --> 05:57.165
<i>everything on the line</i>

05:57.205 --> 05:59.605
for something

05:57.205 --> 05:59.605
that we believe in.

05:59.645 --> 06:02.845
[Fred]<i> Each team</i>

06:02.885 --> 06:05.645

06:06.685 --> 06:09.485
The dish is called Krapow Moo

06:09.525 --> 06:13.445
and it's going to be

06:09.525 --> 06:13.445
a lovely pork mince,

06:09.525 --> 06:13.445
chili and basil stir-fry.

06:13.485 --> 06:15.805
[Fred]<i> If they're chosen</i>

06:13.485 --> 06:15.805
<i>to go to Manchester,</i>

06:15.845 --> 06:20.205

06:20.245 --> 06:21.845
<i>for their first Krapow.</i>

06:21.885 --> 06:23.605
You cannot do

06:21.885 --> 06:23.605
something that is

06:23.645 --> 06:25.885
just as good as

06:23.645 --> 06:25.885
what else is out there

06:23.645 --> 06:25.885
in the market.

06:25.925 --> 06:29.125
-It has to be doing something

06:25.925 --> 06:29.125
much better or different.

06:25.925 --> 06:29.125
-Right.

06:29.165 --> 06:31.645
My name is Chris Miller,

06:29.165 --> 06:31.645
I'm from White Rabbit Fund.

06:31.685 --> 06:34.005
<i>The investment decision</i>

06:31.685 --> 06:34.005
<i>comes down to two things.</i>

06:34.045 --> 06:38.285
They've got to be doing

06:34.045 --> 06:38.285
something incredibly exciting

06:34.045 --> 06:38.285
with the food

06:38.325 --> 06:41.125
and strong enough to actually

06:38.325 --> 06:41.125
launch and grow a business.

06:41.165 --> 06:43.605
We have fantastic

06:41.165 --> 06:43.605
Thai food in this country.

06:43.645 --> 06:46.725
Whether they create something

06:43.645 --> 06:46.725
where people can have

06:43.645 --> 06:46.725
a different kind of experience,

06:46.765 --> 06:48.645
I think that's what

06:46.765 --> 06:48.645
I would want to see.

06:48.685 --> 06:51.285
My name it Atul Kochhar,

06:48.685 --> 06:51.285
I'm a chef restaurateur.

06:51.325 --> 06:54.165
<i>Asia is my region.</i>

06:51.325 --> 06:54.165
<i>I understand it really well.</i>

06:54.205 --> 06:57.645
<i>But people want something new</i>

06:54.205 --> 06:57.645
<i>every few years or so.</i>

06:57.685 --> 07:00.565
So you have to be so much

06:57.685 --> 07:00.565
more sharper and savvier

07:00.605 --> 07:02.725
when it comes to your

07:00.605 --> 07:02.725
investment with new concepts.

07:02.765 --> 07:04.125
[Jamie] I'm a skeptic.

07:04.165 --> 07:07.525
I think that people see

07:04.165 --> 07:07.525
through lack of authenticity.

07:07.565 --> 07:11.405
I'd love to hear from these

07:07.565 --> 07:11.405
guys to see if they really

07:07.565 --> 07:11.405
have put in the effort

07:11.445 --> 07:15.285
to understand the cuisine

07:11.445 --> 07:15.285
rather than just

07:11.445 --> 07:15.285
appropriate it back.

07:15.325 --> 07:17.165
So this is adding in

07:15.325 --> 07:17.165
the Thai basil.

07:17.205 --> 07:19.325
The thing is, if you add it

07:17.205 --> 07:19.325
at the last minute,

07:19.365 --> 07:21.565
it stops it from

07:19.365 --> 07:21.565
wilting too much.

07:21.605 --> 07:25.845
The dish is spicy,

07:21.605 --> 07:25.845
and there's salt in it as well.

07:25.885 --> 07:28.525
The egg just brings

07:25.885 --> 07:28.525
those together.

07:30.085 --> 07:32.645
[Fred] Enough talking.

07:30.085 --> 07:32.645
Time for some Thai food.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.045
-Hey, guys.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.045
-Hi, how are we?

07:42.085 --> 07:44.445
So this is Krapow Moo.

07:44.485 --> 07:47.565
It's a chili and basil

07:44.485 --> 07:47.565
pork mince dish.

07:44.485 --> 07:47.565
We hope you enjoy it.

07:48.165 --> 07:49.125
Let's eat.

08:01.645 --> 08:03.965
What do you think

08:01.645 --> 08:03.965
about the food, guys?

08:04.005 --> 08:06.125
So, that's a really

08:04.005 --> 08:06.125
ugly plate of food.

08:06.165 --> 08:07.605
It's not pretty.

08:07.645 --> 08:10.485
I would question

08:07.645 --> 08:10.485
in the world where

08:10.525 --> 08:13.565
you're content providers

08:10.525 --> 08:13.565
for Instagram and Facebook,

08:13.605 --> 08:17.405
if that's your star dish,

08:13.605 --> 08:17.405
is there a better way

08:13.605 --> 08:17.405
to present it?

08:17.445 --> 08:19.685
I know it doesn't look good

08:17.445 --> 08:19.685
but I absolutely love the dish.

08:19.725 --> 08:21.285
I think it's fantastic.

08:21.325 --> 08:23.845
It's a little bit

08:21.325 --> 08:23.845
like Thai Bolognese,

08:23.885 --> 08:26.725
and luckily I love Bolognese,

08:23.885 --> 08:26.725
so that's terrific.

08:26.765 --> 08:28.525
It is brilliant comfort food,

08:28.565 --> 08:30.205
in the way that Bolognese

08:28.565 --> 08:30.205
is brilliant comfort food.

08:30.245 --> 08:31.365
Yeah, it's a Thai comfort food.

08:32.685 --> 08:35.205
So, guys, one thing

08:32.685 --> 08:35.205
was to understand

08:35.245 --> 08:38.085
what your Thai

08:35.245 --> 08:38.085
credentials are.

08:38.125 --> 08:42.285
I want to feel that it's more

08:38.125 --> 08:42.285
that just a gap-year experience

08:38.125 --> 08:42.285
that you've bought home.

08:42.325 --> 08:45.605
Food, as with culture, anyway,

08:42.325 --> 08:45.605
is constantly evolving.

08:45.645 --> 08:50.605
Wok cooking is only

08:45.645 --> 08:50.605
in Thai cooking because

08:45.645 --> 08:50.605
of Chinese influence.

08:50.645 --> 08:53.125
Chilies only entered Thai

08:50.645 --> 08:53.125
cooking in the 16th century

08:53.165 --> 08:55.765
thanks to

08:53.165 --> 08:55.765
Portuguese travelers.

08:55.805 --> 08:57.445
The world is getting

08:55.805 --> 08:57.445
smaller and smaller

08:57.485 --> 09:01.885
and I don't think

08:57.485 --> 09:01.885
a limitation on the food

08:57.485 --> 09:01.885
you can cook for people

09:01.925 --> 09:04.365
should be based on

09:01.925 --> 09:04.365
who your parents were.

09:04.405 --> 09:06.925
If you've got a passion for it,

09:04.405 --> 09:06.925
go for it.

09:06.965 --> 09:08.885
Can I just say,

09:06.965 --> 09:08.885
that's a knockout answer.

09:08.925 --> 09:11.565
-[Jamie] It's a great answer.

09:08.925 --> 09:11.565
-Straight right, well done.

09:11.605 --> 09:13.085
Where are you at now?

09:13.125 --> 09:14.925
Just slicing up butter now.

09:14.965 --> 09:17.805
[Fred]<i> Next to pitch</i>

09:26.645 --> 09:30.725
<i>fine-dining market.</i>

09:32.605 --> 09:36.165
The dish we're making today

09:32.605 --> 09:36.165
is a little cauliflower dish

09:32.605 --> 09:36.165
that we've got,

09:36.205 --> 09:38.645
and then hat's finished

09:36.205 --> 09:38.645
with our family recipe

09:36.205 --> 09:38.645
curry sauce.

09:39.925 --> 09:41.605
[Joe]<i> We'd love</i>

09:39.925 --> 09:41.605
<i>to have a restaurant.</i>

09:41.645 --> 09:43.685
<i>That's my ultimate</i>

09:41.645 --> 09:43.685
<i>goal in life.</i>

09:43.725 --> 09:48.805
The name itself comes

09:43.725 --> 09:48.805
from two numbers,

09:43.725 --> 09:48.805
being 26 and six.

09:48.845 --> 09:51.205
I lost my eldest brother

09:48.845 --> 09:51.205
to meningitis,

09:51.245 --> 09:53.485
and his lucky number

09:51.245 --> 09:53.485
was 26.

09:53.525 --> 09:57.805
And Aaron's mother passed away,

09:53.525 --> 09:57.805
and her birthday was the 6th.

09:57.845 --> 10:00.925
So it's about remembering

09:57.845 --> 10:00.925
those that we've lost.

10:00.965 --> 10:02.445
This is such

10:00.965 --> 10:02.445
a huge deal for us.

10:02.485 --> 10:04.285
We're so confident

10:02.485 --> 10:04.285
in our food,

10:04.325 --> 10:05.965
we know the flavors work,

10:06.005 --> 10:07.765
we just can't wait to put

10:06.005 --> 10:07.765
that plate down in front

10:06.005 --> 10:07.765
of those investors

10:07.805 --> 10:10.245
and for them to enjoy it.

10:10.285 --> 10:15.605
[Fred]<i> Joe and Aaron want</i>

10:10.285 --> 10:15.605
<i>an investor who'll back them</i>

10:10.285 --> 10:15.605
<i>with half a million pounds.</i>

10:15.645 --> 10:18.165
Do you understand the ethos

10:15.645 --> 10:18.165
and what they are about?

10:18.205 --> 10:20.405
Looking at the branding,

10:20.445 --> 10:23.885
I wouldn't know what it is

10:20.445 --> 10:23.885
if I just saw XXVI on a page.

10:23.925 --> 10:26.645
And that's... That's concerning

10:23.925 --> 10:26.645
when there is

10:23.925 --> 10:26.645
so much competition

10:26.685 --> 10:29.445
and so much noise

10:26.685 --> 10:29.445
in the marketplace.

10:29.485 --> 10:31.125
It's got lemon juice,

10:29.485 --> 10:31.125
it's got peas, it's got dill,

10:31.165 --> 10:34.005
it's got cauli,

10:31.165 --> 10:34.005
it's got ricotta, it's got

10:31.165 --> 10:34.005
sauce, table side, done.

10:34.045 --> 10:35.805
-Yeah, ready to go.

10:34.045 --> 10:35.805
-Ready to go.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.245
Anyway, enough taking.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.245
The food is ready.

10:44.485 --> 10:46.005
-[Jamie] Hey, guys.

10:44.485 --> 10:46.005
-[Atul] Welcome.

10:46.485 --> 10:47.685
Thank you.

10:50.605 --> 10:53.365
So we've got

10:50.605 --> 10:53.365
homemade spiced ricotta,

10:53.405 --> 10:56.005
some charred cauliflower,

10:53.405 --> 10:56.005
some peas

10:56.045 --> 10:57.685
and a family recipe

10:56.045 --> 10:57.685
curry sauce.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.405
-[Fred] Smells delicious.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.405
-[Jamie] It does.

10:59.445 --> 11:00.565
[Fred] Let's eat.

11:12.685 --> 11:15.725
The flavor of the spices,

11:12.685 --> 11:15.725
ricotta, sauce,

11:16.245 --> 11:17.845
incredible.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.885
What I actually like

11:17.885 --> 11:20.885
about it as well,

11:17.885 --> 11:20.885
it feels relatively simple

11:20.925 --> 11:23.365
but tasted excellent.

11:23.405 --> 11:25.845
What does XXVI stand for?

11:25.885 --> 11:29.325
26 was big.

11:25.885 --> 11:29.325
My late brother's lucky number.

11:29.365 --> 11:30.925
I was very dubious

11:29.365 --> 11:30.925
about the name

11:30.965 --> 11:32.845
when I didn't understand

11:30.965 --> 11:32.845
the background.

11:32.885 --> 11:36.125
However, what a lot of

11:32.885 --> 11:36.125
customers are looking for

11:32.885 --> 11:36.125
in the market is soul, heart,

11:36.165 --> 11:38.525
you know, real feeling

11:36.165 --> 11:38.525
coming through.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.445
That could be a strong suit.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.445
I would just caution

11:40.485 --> 11:43.325
the story is potentially

11:40.485 --> 11:43.325
a little bit too serious.

11:43.365 --> 11:45.525
After all,

11:43.365 --> 11:45.525
we go out to have fun

11:43.365 --> 11:45.525
and enjoy ourselves

11:45.565 --> 11:47.565
-and sort of forget about

11:45.565 --> 11:47.565
some of those issues.

11:45.565 --> 11:47.565
-Yeah, of course.

11:49.565 --> 11:52.485
You guys seem to be

11:49.565 --> 11:52.485
incredibly talented chefs,

11:52.525 --> 11:55.085
but I'm not really feeling

11:55.125 --> 11:57.645
the fact that you're

11:55.125 --> 11:57.645
exposed to business enough

11:57.685 --> 11:59.485
to be able to carry through

11:57.685 --> 11:59.485
a full restaurant.

11:59.525 --> 12:03.605
We know around about the bases

11:59.525 --> 12:03.605
to get us sort of started

12:03.645 --> 12:06.645
and then, obviously,

12:03.645 --> 12:06.645
if one of you guys

12:03.645 --> 12:06.645
came on board

12:06.685 --> 12:09.845
then it's that teaching

12:06.685 --> 12:09.845
that we can obviously

12:06.685 --> 12:09.845
get off yourselves.

12:09.885 --> 12:12.205
But if we invested in you,

12:12.245 --> 12:14.485
how do you think we would

12:12.245 --> 12:14.485
get that money back?

12:20.805 --> 12:22.765
-Good question.

12:20.805 --> 12:22.765
-That's a long silence.

12:22.805 --> 12:24.005
[all chuckling]

12:24.805 --> 12:26.565
It's very daunting sat there

12:26.605 --> 12:29.525
in front of those investors,

12:26.605 --> 12:29.525
knowing they're the big boys

12:26.605 --> 12:29.525
in the industry,

12:29.565 --> 12:32.605
scrutinizing everything

12:29.565 --> 12:32.605
that we've done.

12:34.805 --> 12:39.125
[Fred]<i> The last team dreaming</i>

[Fred]<i> Indian restaurant chains</i>

12:42.405 --> 12:46.245

12:46.285 --> 12:51.405
<i>with Indian flavors will be</i>

12:46.285 --> 12:51.405

13:05.125 --> 13:06.765
[interviewer] What's it like

13:05.125 --> 13:06.765
working together?

13:06.805 --> 13:10.125
-Terrible. [laughs]

13:06.805 --> 13:10.125
-Awful. [laughing]

13:10.165 --> 13:13.445
[Fred]<i> They've built up</i>

<i>in London's busiest</i>

13:13.485 --> 13:16.165

13:16.205 --> 13:19.565
When you see people

13:16.205 --> 13:19.565
sitting around eating

13:16.205 --> 13:19.565
trays of Baba G's,

13:19.605 --> 13:22.085
it feels great,

13:19.605 --> 13:22.085
'cause you've created that,

13:19.605 --> 13:22.085
and they're loving it,

13:22.125 --> 13:23.645
and that feels amazing.

13:25.685 --> 13:28.565
-I can do this bit, Al.

13:25.685 --> 13:28.565
-Okay, sorry.

13:28.605 --> 13:30.845
[Alec]

13:28.605 --> 13:30.845
<i>We're doing our signature</i>

13:28.605 --> 13:30.845

13:33.205 --> 13:36.645

13:33.205 --> 13:36.645
tamarind sauce and then

13:33.205 --> 13:36.645
an onion bhaji,

13:36.685 --> 13:40.125
finish it all off with

13:36.685 --> 13:40.125
a bit of mint raita

13:36.685 --> 13:40.125
and that's your Bhangra Burger.

13:40.165 --> 13:43.645
[Fred]<i> Liz and Alec</i>

<i>want Â£300,000</i>

13:43.685 --> 13:47.325
<i>from an investor to set up</i>

13:43.685 --> 13:47.325
<i>not one but two restaurants.</i>

13:47.365 --> 13:50.325
Indian's one of the most

13:47.365 --> 13:50.325
popular cuisines in the UK,

13:50.365 --> 13:54.005
and if you put a burger

13:50.365 --> 13:54.005
onto any menu it'll be

13:50.365 --> 13:54.005
your top-selling item.

13:55.885 --> 13:58.485
This is closhing,

13:55.885 --> 13:58.485
it's just to get the steam

13:55.885 --> 13:58.485
through the burger

13:58.525 --> 14:01.365
so it's cooking from the inside

13:58.525 --> 14:01.365
and the outside as well.

14:01.405 --> 14:04.005
It's not very often

14:01.405 --> 14:04.005
you get in front of people

14:04.045 --> 14:06.485
who can really

14:04.045 --> 14:06.485
help push it forward.

14:06.525 --> 14:09.245
<i>We're going to feel nervous</i>

14:06.525 --> 14:09.245
<i>when you're stood in front of</i>

14:09.285 --> 14:13.525
<i>people bearing your heart out</i>

14:09.285 --> 14:13.525
<i>I suppose,</i>

14:13.565 --> 14:15.205
but let's see.

14:17.405 --> 14:18.725
Let me bring them in here.

14:23.165 --> 14:25.005
-[Charlie] Hey.

14:23.165 --> 14:25.005
-Hi, there.

14:25.045 --> 14:26.645
-Hi.

14:25.045 --> 14:26.645
-[Jamie] Wow, look at that.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.045
[Chris] Thank you so much.

14:28.085 --> 14:29.205
[Liz] That's a Bhangra Burger.

14:30.285 --> 14:31.365
[Fred] Let's eat.

14:36.285 --> 14:37.885
[Fred] Ooh.

14:37.925 --> 14:40.925
Yeah, the sauce

14:37.925 --> 14:40.925
on the side is our...

14:40.965 --> 14:43.645
-Naga chili.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.645
-Naga chili. It's really hot.

14:43.685 --> 14:47.285
-That needs to come

14:43.685 --> 14:47.285
with a warning.

14:43.685 --> 14:47.285
-You've killed Fred.

14:47.325 --> 14:50.765
My God, that's really...

14:47.325 --> 14:50.765
I just tried a bit of it.

14:50.805 --> 14:53.485
Investors, can I ask your first

14:50.805 --> 14:53.485
impressions about the food?

14:53.525 --> 14:55.525
I own a group of, uh,

14:55.565 --> 14:58.525
probably the best burger

14:55.565 --> 14:58.525
group in the country,

14:58.565 --> 15:01.005
so I think I know

14:58.565 --> 15:01.005
a little bit about burgers.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.005
I think this was great.

15:01.045 --> 15:04.285
I thought actually

15:01.045 --> 15:04.285
the patty was a bit coarse

15:01.045 --> 15:04.285
for my liking

15:04.325 --> 15:05.805
in terms of the grind.

15:07.085 --> 15:08.685
Do you make that yourselves?

15:08.725 --> 15:10.325
-We do make the patties

15:08.725 --> 15:10.325
ourselves, yes.

15:08.725 --> 15:10.325
-We make the patties.

15:10.365 --> 15:11.805
You make the patties

15:10.365 --> 15:11.805
yourself, okay.

15:11.845 --> 15:14.005
But I thought it was

15:11.845 --> 15:14.005
very good. I thought

15:11.845 --> 15:14.005
it was great.

15:14.045 --> 15:15.965
The flavors are there,

15:14.045 --> 15:15.965
spectacular flavors.

15:16.005 --> 15:18.485
And the Naga chili pickle,

15:16.005 --> 15:18.485
wow, the affect

15:16.005 --> 15:18.485
was amazing here.

15:18.525 --> 15:20.845
[Liz laughing]

15:20.885 --> 15:26.005
What is the idea?

15:20.885 --> 15:26.005
What is the customer

15:20.885 --> 15:26.005
experience going to be?

15:26.045 --> 15:30.925
We are very good at doing

15:26.045 --> 15:30.925
fast casual dining

15:26.045 --> 15:30.925
in high footfall areas.

15:30.965 --> 15:33.765
So we're looking to open,

15:30.965 --> 15:33.765
like, two smaller outlets

15:33.805 --> 15:35.845
that's true to what

15:33.805 --> 15:35.845
our experience is.

15:35.885 --> 15:38.485
Can you answer the question.

15:35.885 --> 15:38.485
Is it table service?

15:38.525 --> 15:40.125
-We're not sure at this--

15:38.525 --> 15:40.125
-Or is it counter service?

15:40.165 --> 15:41.525
We are not sure

15:40.165 --> 15:41.525
at this point.

15:41.565 --> 15:45.165
We want to be somewhere

15:41.565 --> 15:45.165
between a Wahaca,

15:45.205 --> 15:46.445
where it is table service--

15:46.485 --> 15:48.685
I'm hearing on the one hand

15:46.485 --> 15:48.685
only a few tables.

15:48.725 --> 15:51.645
But to do Wahaca

15:48.725 --> 15:51.645
you need 150 seats.

15:51.685 --> 15:55.085
Going forward I'd like to

15:51.685 --> 15:55.085
get bigger... We would

15:51.685 --> 15:55.085
like to get bigger sites.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.805
Just stay to what

15:55.125 --> 15:56.805
we're asking for now.

15:57.405 --> 15:59.685
Sorry.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.645
If you choose these two guys,

15:59.725 --> 16:02.645
you know, to go to Manchester

16:02.685 --> 16:06.045
and run the pop-up

16:02.685 --> 16:06.045
for a couple of days,

16:02.685 --> 16:06.045
what do you want to see?

16:06.085 --> 16:09.125
Kind of like to understand

16:06.085 --> 16:09.125
whether you can operate

16:06.085 --> 16:09.125
as an all-day brand.

16:09.165 --> 16:10.565
[Alec] Yes, yes.

16:10.605 --> 16:12.085
[Atul] Clearly I would like

16:10.605 --> 16:12.085
to see more food from them.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.445
Drinks is going to be

16:12.125 --> 16:14.445
the major offering from me,

16:14.485 --> 16:17.045
because that is real money,

16:14.485 --> 16:17.045
in my opinion.

16:17.085 --> 16:18.805
Decide what you want

16:17.085 --> 16:18.805
to do with the brand

16:18.845 --> 16:21.085
in terms of service,

16:18.845 --> 16:21.085
in terms of type of site.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.965
At the moment,

16:21.125 --> 16:23.965
I don't really know what

16:21.125 --> 16:23.965
I would be investing in.

16:24.005 --> 16:27.845
We've built this up from

16:24.005 --> 16:27.845
an original investment

16:24.005 --> 16:27.845
of Â£3,000.

16:27.885 --> 16:29.725
We've made a lot of

16:27.885 --> 16:29.725
mistakes over the years,

16:29.765 --> 16:32.845
and we feel like now's

16:29.765 --> 16:32.845
the time that we can use

16:29.765 --> 16:32.845
other people's money

16:32.885 --> 16:34.445
and not make mistakes

16:32.885 --> 16:34.445
with theirs.

16:34.485 --> 16:35.965
[all laughing]

16:36.005 --> 16:37.885
No, not make mistakes

16:36.005 --> 16:37.885
with theirs!

16:37.925 --> 16:39.365
Foot in mouth.

16:39.405 --> 16:40.805
-Thank you very much.

16:39.405 --> 16:40.805
-Thank you.

16:41.885 --> 16:44.405
-Thank you, guys.

16:41.885 --> 16:44.405
-Thank you for your time.

16:44.445 --> 16:46.485
[Liz] I do feel relieved

16:44.445 --> 16:46.485
now that we're out.

16:46.525 --> 16:48.645
I thought it went well.

16:46.525 --> 16:48.645
We were honest

16:46.525 --> 16:48.645
as we could be,

16:48.685 --> 16:50.605
and I put my foot

16:48.685 --> 16:50.605
in my mouth a few times,

16:50.645 --> 16:53.445
but that's kind of me

16:50.645 --> 16:53.445
anyway, so...

16:53.485 --> 16:57.565
Investors, we just had

16:53.485 --> 16:57.565
three very strong ideas

16:53.485 --> 16:57.565
presented in front of us.

16:57.605 --> 17:00.645
We have to decide,

16:57.605 --> 17:00.645
who is going to Manchester?

17:00.685 --> 17:05.045
<i>The investors will choose</i>

17:00.685 --> 17:05.045
<i>the best idea by majority vote</i>

17:05.085 --> 17:07.085
<i>but can pull out</i>

17:05.085 --> 17:07.085
<i>if they're not interested.</i>

17:08.765 --> 17:10.725
So first, let's talk about...

17:10.765 --> 17:12.445
I can't even say it. [laughs]

17:12.485 --> 17:14.405
<i>-XXVI.</i>

17:12.485 --> 17:14.405
-[Charlie]<i> That's the problem.</i>

17:14.445 --> 17:16.085
[Atul]

17:14.445 --> 17:16.085
They can cook, definitely.

17:16.125 --> 17:19.525
The flavors were good.

17:16.125 --> 17:19.525
Conceptualizing of the dish

17:16.125 --> 17:19.525
was very good.

17:19.565 --> 17:21.765
[Chris]<i> I actually think</i>

17:19.565 --> 17:21.765
<i>they had the best food.</i>

17:21.805 --> 17:25.125
But the team,

17:21.805 --> 17:25.125
I would be worried if they

17:25.165 --> 17:28.925
really could go out

17:25.165 --> 17:28.925
and launch a restaurant.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.045
For Atul to say that

17:28.965 --> 17:31.045
flavors were great,

17:31.085 --> 17:33.285
'cause he's like obviously

17:31.085 --> 17:33.285
a Michelin-starred Indian chef

17:33.325 --> 17:36.085
and that was...

17:33.325 --> 17:36.085
That was huge for us.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.645
Charlie, what about Krapow?

17:37.685 --> 17:41.125
It's not a refined dish

17:37.685 --> 17:41.125
by any stretch

17:37.685 --> 17:41.125
of the imagination,

17:41.165 --> 17:46.445
but I can see that brand

17:41.165 --> 17:46.445
as a combination of grab-and-go

17:41.165 --> 17:46.445
and fast casual.

17:46.485 --> 17:48.405
How do you see it

17:46.485 --> 17:48.405
as grab-and-go?

17:46.485 --> 17:48.405
In what way?

17:48.445 --> 17:50.005
Well, you come in

17:48.445 --> 17:50.005
and order at the counter

17:50.045 --> 17:51.565
and they stick it in the box

17:50.045 --> 17:51.565
and give it to you.

17:51.605 --> 17:53.045
[Jamie]

17:51.605 --> 17:53.045
Bolognese and rice in it.

17:53.085 --> 17:55.125
-So you think

17:53.085 --> 17:55.125
there's potential here?

17:53.085 --> 17:55.125
-I do, yeah.

17:55.165 --> 17:57.125
I think they have

17:55.165 --> 17:57.125
the personality,

17:57.165 --> 17:59.165
they have a good understanding

17:57.165 --> 17:59.165
of business as well.

17:59.205 --> 18:00.925
Two people absolutely

17:59.205 --> 18:00.925
loved the branding,

18:00.965 --> 18:03.005
two of them were

18:00.965 --> 18:03.005
like no, hate it.

18:03.045 --> 18:04.725
What about Baba G?

18:04.765 --> 18:07.085
You know, there's not

18:04.765 --> 18:07.085
many people that's doing

18:04.765 --> 18:07.085
that style of cuisine

18:07.125 --> 18:09.765
<i>and yet it's something</i>

18:07.125 --> 18:09.765
<i>that appeals to quite</i>

18:07.125 --> 18:09.765
<i>a large group of people,</i>

18:09.805 --> 18:11.245
so I really liked that.

18:11.285 --> 18:13.565
I think all them

18:11.285 --> 18:13.565
generally liked our concept,

18:11.285 --> 18:13.565
didn't they?

18:13.605 --> 18:16.205
-It was just when

18:13.605 --> 18:16.205
we started to...

18:13.605 --> 18:16.205
-Talk.

18:16.245 --> 18:18.045
[all laughing]

18:18.085 --> 18:19.885
Or maybe me.

18:19.925 --> 18:23.725
I felt that Krapow

18:19.925 --> 18:23.725
was very well-disciplined

18:19.925 --> 18:23.725
but the food was disappointing.

18:23.765 --> 18:27.045
But I found Baba G's food

18:23.765 --> 18:27.045
compelling but I thought

18:23.765 --> 18:27.045
they were chaotic.

18:27.085 --> 18:30.565
Would I trust them

18:27.085 --> 18:30.565
with Â£300,000

18:30.605 --> 18:32.885
and scale of restaurants,

18:32.925 --> 18:34.645
-that's a question.

18:32.925 --> 18:34.645
-Right.

18:34.685 --> 18:37.965
One of these businesses

18:34.685 --> 18:37.965
has to go to Manchester.

18:38.005 --> 18:39.005
Who is it gonna be?

18:40.565 --> 18:43.485
[Fred]<i> Someone is about</i>

18:40.565 --> 18:43.485
<i>to be a step closer</i>

18:43.525 --> 18:45.165
<i>to the dream</i>

18:43.525 --> 18:45.165
<i>of their own restaurant.</i>

18:49.365 --> 18:51.925
You've all made

18:49.365 --> 18:51.925
a very, very good impression

18:51.965 --> 18:54.365
and, um, the investors

18:51.965 --> 18:54.365
were split.

18:54.405 --> 18:57.085
It was very interesting

18:54.405 --> 18:57.085
to see them debate,

18:54.405 --> 18:57.085
you know, businesses.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.325
But anyway, they have

18:57.125 --> 18:59.325
made a decision.

18:59.365 --> 19:02.885
The idea that, for them,

18:59.365 --> 19:02.885
has the most

18:59.365 --> 19:02.885
investment potential

19:03.605 --> 19:05.445
is Baba G.

19:10.965 --> 19:15.605
Baba G, for me,

19:10.965 --> 19:15.605
is the most natural fit

19:10.965 --> 19:15.605
for my skill set.

19:15.645 --> 19:19.725
It translates into

19:15.645 --> 19:19.725
a casual dining environment

19:15.645 --> 19:19.725
very easily,

19:19.765 --> 19:21.085
and I think

19:19.765 --> 19:21.085
I can add value.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.845
They had raw talent

19:22.885 --> 19:27.045
and also, they started

19:22.885 --> 19:27.045
with three grand,

19:22.885 --> 19:27.045
they now have three venues.

19:27.085 --> 19:30.365
Clearly, they've worked out

19:27.085 --> 19:30.365
how to make money.

19:30.405 --> 19:33.485
It was a burger.

19:33.525 --> 19:36.405
Bollywood, boisterous, big.

19:36.445 --> 19:38.005
All fantastic things,

19:36.445 --> 19:38.005
to be honest.

19:38.045 --> 19:39.925
And they're ready to move

19:38.045 --> 19:39.925
to the next level.

19:39.965 --> 19:41.085
How do you feel?

19:41.125 --> 19:42.805
Amazing.

19:42.845 --> 19:44.405
This will give us

19:42.845 --> 19:44.405
the opportunity to kind of

19:42.845 --> 19:44.405
show them that we do know

19:45.205 --> 19:46.925
the vision for Baba G's.

19:46.965 --> 19:50.365
Shall I tell you which

19:46.965 --> 19:50.365
of the investors

19:46.965 --> 19:50.365
think your ideas

19:50.405 --> 19:52.165
has the most

19:50.405 --> 19:52.165
investment potential?

19:52.205 --> 19:54.285
-Yes, definitely.

19:52.205 --> 19:54.285
-Yes, absolutely.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.405
-Charlie McVeigh.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.405
-[Alec] Yeah?

19:56.445 --> 19:57.925
-Jamie Barber.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.925
-Ooh.

19:57.965 --> 20:00.045
-Atul Kochhar.

19:57.965 --> 20:00.045
-Ooh!

20:00.085 --> 20:01.285
Chris Miller,

20:00.085 --> 20:01.285
unfortunately, is out.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.285
But you've got three

20:01.325 --> 20:03.285
out of four.

20:03.325 --> 20:07.365
There are lots of disasters

20:03.325 --> 20:07.365
and lots of ups and downs

20:03.325 --> 20:07.365
when you open a restaurant,

20:07.405 --> 20:09.925
and I need to be able

20:07.405 --> 20:09.925
to see that those guys

20:09.965 --> 20:14.165
can really drag it from

20:09.965 --> 20:14.165
an idea into a restaurant.

20:14.205 --> 20:16.805
And they didn't turn up

20:14.205 --> 20:16.805
with that certainty.

20:16.845 --> 20:20.725
You really have to nail down

20:16.845 --> 20:20.725
the feedback that they've

20:16.845 --> 20:20.725
given you, right?

20:20.765 --> 20:22.925
Without forgetting drinks,

20:20.765 --> 20:22.925
because this is

20:22.965 --> 20:25.845
a big part of the business,

20:22.965 --> 20:25.845
and this is how

20:22.965 --> 20:25.845
you can turn a profit.

20:25.885 --> 20:28.965
Think about your vision,

20:25.885 --> 20:28.965
what does your restaurant

20:25.885 --> 20:28.965
look like?

20:29.005 --> 20:30.805
What is the customer journey

20:30.845 --> 20:33.765
from the moment they walk

20:30.845 --> 20:33.765
through the door to the

20:30.845 --> 20:33.765
moment that they leave?

20:33.805 --> 20:36.605
And you two have to sing

20:33.805 --> 20:36.605
from the same song sheet.

20:36.645 --> 20:38.125
I think we'll take from this.

20:38.165 --> 20:39.405
We'll actually have to start

20:38.165 --> 20:39.405
agreeing for once in our lives.

20:39.445 --> 20:41.445
[all laughing]

20:41.485 --> 20:42.725
-Good luck.

20:41.485 --> 20:42.725
-Thank you.

20:42.765 --> 20:44.205
Good luck.

20:45.765 --> 20:47.645
-Take care, see you later.

20:45.765 --> 20:47.645
-Thank you.

20:47.685 --> 20:49.565
-Thank you.

[Fred]<i> Baba G has made it</i>

21:02.685 --> 21:04.685
<i>to Manchester.</i>

21:04.725 --> 21:08.925
They've got two days

21:04.725 --> 21:08.925
to convince the investors that

21:04.725 --> 21:08.925
they are worth investing in.

21:08.965 --> 21:11.325
All they have to do

21:08.965 --> 21:11.325
is run a restaurant.

21:11.965 --> 21:14.045
Should be easy.

21:14.085 --> 21:17.965
<i>Tonight, Liz and Alec will</i>

21:18.005 --> 21:21.965
<i>for the first time.</i>

21:22.005 --> 21:24.485
Look at the big sign.

21:22.005 --> 21:24.485
Can you see the sign?

21:24.525 --> 21:26.285
-Oh, wow.

21:24.525 --> 21:26.285
-My heart...

21:27.365 --> 21:29.365
Oh, my God.

21:29.405 --> 21:32.125

21:35.245 --> 21:37.325
-That's perfect.

Yep, that is, yes.

21:46.965 --> 21:50.645
<i>...the investors will watch</i>

21:50.685 --> 21:54.085

<i>whether they're worth</i>

21:50.685 --> 21:54.085
<i>an investment.</i>

21:55.685 --> 21:57.605
To be able

21:55.685 --> 21:57.605
to get the investment

21:57.645 --> 21:59.885
and for this to actually

21:57.645 --> 21:59.885
become a reality,

21:59.925 --> 22:02.805
to see it all is,

21:59.925 --> 22:02.805
yeah, overwhelming.

22:03.685 --> 22:04.965
-Bit choked up.

22:03.685 --> 22:04.965
-Yeah.

[Fred]<i> 37-year-old Alec</i>

22:10.245 --> 22:13.165

22:13.205 --> 22:16.605
<i>where his mum introduced him</i>

22:13.205 --> 22:16.605
<i>to a world of Indian spices.</i>

22:16.645 --> 22:19.085
And some fries over here

22:16.645 --> 22:19.085
when you get a sec.

22:19.125 --> 22:21.645
[Fred]<i> He started Baba G's</i>

22:19.125 --> 22:21.645
<i>ten years ago,</i>

22:21.685 --> 22:23.925
<i>and only a few months later,</i>

22:23.965 --> 22:27.325
<i>met Liz who was working</i>

22:23.965 --> 22:27.325
<i>on another stall.</i>

22:27.365 --> 22:29.125
If you ever needed

22:27.365 --> 22:29.125
to know where Alec was,

22:29.165 --> 22:31.765
you would generally find him

22:29.165 --> 22:31.765
laughing, eating,

22:31.805 --> 22:36.605
and creating a fun atmosphere

22:31.805 --> 22:36.605
and vibe everywhere

22:31.805 --> 22:36.605
that he went.

22:36.645 --> 22:38.125
[Alec]

22:36.645 --> 22:38.125
How long on your burgers?

22:38.165 --> 22:40.445
Liz is definitely

22:38.165 --> 22:40.445
the rock in the business.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.485
<i>I couldn't do it without her.</i>

22:42.525 --> 22:44.045
Don't tell her that though.

22:44.085 --> 22:45.445
[laughing]

22:45.485 --> 22:47.285
<i>At some points</i>

22:45.485 --> 22:47.285
<i>it's been a real struggle.</i>

22:47.325 --> 22:49.845
We were spending

22:47.325 --> 22:49.845
a lot of time running round,

22:49.885 --> 22:52.805
knackering yourself out,

22:49.885 --> 22:52.805
running from festival

22:49.885 --> 22:52.805
to festival,

22:52.845 --> 22:54.845
with very little to show

22:52.845 --> 22:54.845
at the end of it.

22:54.885 --> 22:58.325
The realization of how

22:54.885 --> 22:58.325
tough it was, was when

22:54.885 --> 22:58.325
our son came along.

22:58.365 --> 23:00.365
<i>I think even when</i>

22:58.365 --> 23:00.365
<i>I came out of hospital,</i>

23:00.405 --> 23:03.565
<i>Alec had to go out</i>

23:00.405 --> 23:03.565
<i>because at the last minute</i>

23:00.405 --> 23:03.565
<i>we had a job</i>

23:03.605 --> 23:06.165
<i>that was gonna basically</i>

23:03.605 --> 23:06.165
<i>pay our rent for the month.</i>

23:06.205 --> 23:07.685
It was really hand-to-mouth.

23:07.725 --> 23:11.245
[Alec]

23:07.725 --> 23:11.245
<i>Everything we do is with</i>

23:07.725 --> 23:11.245
<i>Abe in mind, you know.</i>

23:11.285 --> 23:13.085
Mmm. I like it.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.085
We want to leave something,

23:13.125 --> 23:16.085
a legacy behind, that can

23:13.125 --> 23:16.085
help him in any way.

[Alec] Hey, Baba G!

23:19.045 --> 23:22.845
[Fred]<i> Liz and Alec</i>

23:27.045 --> 23:31.205
but to the staff that have been

23:27.045 --> 23:31.205
with us for such a long time.

23:31.245 --> 23:34.325
It's about eight hours

23:31.245 --> 23:34.325
till we open and a lot to do.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.245
Feel like it's our duty

23:38.765 --> 23:41.245
to make sure like

23:38.765 --> 23:41.245
we're all prepared.

23:41.285 --> 23:45.045
<i>They can be stressed</i>

<i>them we've got their backs.</i>

23:45.085 --> 23:47.805
[Alec] We're gonna do

23:45.085 --> 23:47.805
two of the chocolate.

23:47.845 --> 23:50.885
We're gonna do

23:47.845 --> 23:50.885
a half of cinnamon.

23:50.925 --> 23:55.245
[Fred]<i> During the pitch</i>

24:03.005 --> 24:06.165
and hope for the best.

24:07.205 --> 24:08.205
Right, let's try it.

24:10.725 --> 24:13.485
If this can't get the investors

24:10.725 --> 24:13.485
to part with that 300 grand,

24:10.725 --> 24:13.485
nothing will.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.405
-How are you?

24:16.205 --> 24:17.405
-Hi, Alec.

24:17.445 --> 24:18.765

24:28.645 --> 24:31.285
Energy. Can't believe

24:28.645 --> 24:31.285
it's happening right now.

24:31.325 --> 24:33.485
-You must be excited?

24:31.325 --> 24:33.485
-Yeah, very excited.

24:33.525 --> 24:35.965
And so you know you've got

24:33.525 --> 24:35.965
three major investors

24:36.005 --> 24:38.285
who are all gonna experience

24:36.005 --> 24:38.285
Baba G in a restaurant setting.

24:38.325 --> 24:41.485
The only variable that I...

24:38.325 --> 24:41.485
That I...

24:41.525 --> 24:43.845
That is making

24:41.525 --> 24:43.845
me slightly nervous

24:41.525 --> 24:43.845
is just making sure that,

24:43.885 --> 24:48.845
because we don't do sit-down,

24:43.885 --> 24:48.845
is that the whole actual

24:43.885 --> 24:48.845
table service runs fluidly.

24:48.885 --> 24:51.685
You've got to run

24:48.885 --> 24:51.685
this operation, I mean,

24:48.885 --> 24:51.685
you've run it in muddy fields.

24:51.725 --> 24:53.965
But it's going to be

24:51.725 --> 24:53.965
very different,

24:51.725 --> 24:53.965
it's going to be like theater.

24:54.005 --> 24:55.925
It's got to be choreographed

24:55.965 --> 24:58.285
and everybody's got to know

24:55.965 --> 24:58.285
what they've got to do.

24:58.325 --> 24:59.925
-Yeah.

24:58.325 --> 24:59.925
-If you do that,

24:59.965 --> 25:01.645
-you are gonna win.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.645
-[Liz] Yes.

25:01.685 --> 25:04.805
[Fred]<i> But of course,</i>

25:01.685 --> 25:04.805
<i>service is only</i>

25:01.685 --> 25:04.805
<i>half the battle.</i>

25:04.845 --> 25:09.525
<i>I want to know if Liz and Alec</i>

25:04.845 --> 25:09.525
<i>have changed their menu</i>

25:04.845 --> 25:09.525
<i>since meeting the investors.</i>

25:09.565 --> 25:11.405
[Alec]

25:09.565 --> 25:11.405
<i>The feedback we got</i>

25:11.445 --> 25:13.565
<i>was about obviously,</i>

25:11.445 --> 25:13.565
<i>the burgers, um,</i>

25:13.605 --> 25:15.765
<i>they were saying</i>

25:13.605 --> 25:15.765
<i>our grind was quite coarse.</i>

25:15.805 --> 25:19.125
So we decided

25:15.805 --> 25:19.125
to double grind

25:19.165 --> 25:20.685
and it still

25:19.165 --> 25:20.685
wasn't quite there,

25:20.725 --> 25:22.725
so we did try a triple grind

25:22.765 --> 25:24.765
against the advice

25:22.765 --> 25:24.765
of our butcher

25:24.805 --> 25:26.405
and found that

25:24.805 --> 25:26.405
we really liked it.

25:26.445 --> 25:28.285
But what about the recipe?

25:26.445 --> 25:28.285
Is the recipe the same?

25:28.325 --> 25:29.565
We've kept the recipe

25:28.325 --> 25:29.565
the same, yeah.

25:29.605 --> 25:31.845
We toast off

25:29.605 --> 25:31.845
some cumin seeds,

25:31.885 --> 25:34.725
um, we put dried chili flakes.

25:34.765 --> 25:36.605
And a bit of coriander.

25:36.645 --> 25:39.485
I mean, obviously,

25:36.645 --> 25:39.485
with the meat

25:36.645 --> 25:39.485
and with the burger

25:39.525 --> 25:42.245
the worst thing you can do

25:39.525 --> 25:42.245
is get salt through the mix

25:42.285 --> 25:44.485
because it just pulls

25:42.285 --> 25:44.485
all the fat out

25:44.525 --> 25:47.045
and all the juice

25:44.525 --> 25:47.045
out of the burger

25:44.525 --> 25:47.045
before you cook it.

25:47.085 --> 25:50.245
This is our Baba G

25:47.085 --> 25:50.245
secret spice mix.

25:50.285 --> 25:51.525
[Fred] What's the spice here?

25:51.565 --> 25:53.405
Yeah, well,

25:51.565 --> 25:53.405
that would be telling.

25:53.445 --> 25:54.805
-Come on.

25:53.445 --> 25:54.805
-[laughs]

25:54.845 --> 25:56.205
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

25:56.245 --> 25:58.405
[laughing]

25:58.445 --> 26:00.325
And then straight

25:58.445 --> 26:00.325
onto the grill just like that.

26:01.685 --> 26:06.325
The UK burger market is worth

26:01.685 --> 26:06.325
a staggering 3.3 billion

26:06.365 --> 26:08.365
and Baba G

26:06.365 --> 26:08.365
want a piece of it.

26:08.405 --> 26:10.685
They think they can bring

26:08.405 --> 26:10.685
something new and fresh

26:10.725 --> 26:12.485
to this already crowded space.

26:14.725 --> 26:18.525
<i>In fact, their whole menu</i>

26:14.725 --> 26:18.525
<i>is packed with Indian twists</i>

26:18.565 --> 26:21.765
<i>on familiar fast food dishes.</i>

26:21.805 --> 26:25.965
<i>Tonight, they've got</i>

26:21.805 --> 26:25.965
<i>tikka chicken nuggets</i>

26:21.805 --> 26:25.965
<i>and fries for Â£9.</i>

26:27.725 --> 26:32.565
<i>Poppadoms have been fused</i>

26:27.725 --> 26:32.565
<i>with nachos to create "Pachos,"</i>

26:27.725 --> 26:32.565
<i>for Â£6.</i>

26:34.285 --> 26:38.605
<i>And for vegans,</i>

26:34.285 --> 26:38.605
<i>they've created a Baba Bowl</i>

26:34.285 --> 26:38.605
<i>curry for Â£12.</i>

26:39.925 --> 26:41.725
Let me show you something.

26:41.765 --> 26:45.245
Baba G's normally sell

26:41.765 --> 26:45.245
their burger for Â£8

26:41.765 --> 26:45.245
when they are on the stall.

26:45.285 --> 26:47.925
Here they are selling them

26:45.285 --> 26:47.925
for Â£12.50,

26:47.965 --> 26:50.685
but they've added

26:47.965 --> 26:50.685
the fries within the price.

26:50.725 --> 26:52.445
<i>This could be very clever.</i>

26:52.485 --> 26:56.005
<i>The customer is paying</i>

26:52.485 --> 26:56.005
<i>for fries whether they</i>

26:52.485 --> 26:56.005
<i>want them or not,</i>

26:56.045 --> 26:58.765
<i>and fries are an item</i>

26:56.045 --> 26:58.765
<i>with great profit margin.</i>

26:59.765 --> 27:01.165
<i>But will the investors agree?</i>

27:07.565 --> 27:11.045
<i>Two weeks after</i>

27:07.565 --> 27:11.045
<i>the investors first had</i>

27:07.565 --> 27:11.045
<i>a taste of Baba G's,</i>

27:12.605 --> 27:14.285
<i>they're in Manchester</i>

27:12.605 --> 27:14.285
<i>for more.</i>

27:15.765 --> 27:17.605
<i>Over the next two days,</i>

27:17.645 --> 27:22.285
<i>they'll put Liz and Alec's</i>

27:17.645 --> 27:22.285
<i>business plan, service</i>

27:17.645 --> 27:22.285
<i>and food to the test.</i>

27:22.325 --> 27:25.205
<i>Tomorrow evening,</i>

27:22.325 --> 27:25.205
<i>if they like what they see,</i>

27:25.245 --> 27:27.285
<i>there might even be</i>

27:25.245 --> 27:27.285
<i>a fight to invest.</i>

27:28.525 --> 27:31.005
<i>First to arrive</i>

27:28.525 --> 27:31.005
<i>is Jamie Barbour,</i>

27:31.045 --> 27:33.925
<i>who's backed a string</i>

27:31.045 --> 27:33.925
<i>of successful brands.</i>

27:33.965 --> 27:39.525
<i>He's after concepts that can</i>

27:33.965 --> 27:39.525
<i>make money now times</i>

27:33.965 --> 27:39.525
<i>are tough on the high street.</i>

27:39.565 --> 27:43.445
So in the old days

27:39.565 --> 27:43.445
the sales were here,

27:39.565 --> 27:43.445
your costs were here

27:43.485 --> 27:45.805
and your profit was

27:43.485 --> 27:45.805
everything in the middle.

27:45.845 --> 27:48.685
Now what's happening

27:45.845 --> 27:48.685
is that there's been a big

27:45.845 --> 27:48.685
pressure on the top line

27:48.725 --> 27:51.805
through over-competition,

27:48.725 --> 27:51.805
through Deliveroo,

27:48.725 --> 27:51.805
through Uber Eats,

27:51.845 --> 27:54.325
through millennials

27:51.845 --> 27:54.325
choosing other things to do,

27:54.365 --> 27:58.205
so the top line

27:54.365 --> 27:58.205
has gone like this,

27:54.365 --> 27:58.205
and at the same time

27:58.245 --> 28:02.125
minimum wage has gone up,

27:58.245 --> 28:02.125
rates have been revalued,

28:02.165 --> 28:03.885
rent reviews have taken place,

28:03.925 --> 28:06.125
the exchange rate means

28:03.925 --> 28:06.125
that everything's

28:03.925 --> 28:06.125
more expensive to purchase.

28:06.165 --> 28:08.645
So the costs have gone

28:06.165 --> 28:08.645
like that and then suddenly

28:08.685 --> 28:11.925
that bit in the middle

28:08.685 --> 28:11.925
is not a profit anymore,

28:08.685 --> 28:11.925
it's a loss.

28:11.965 --> 28:14.285
So whenever I'm looking

28:11.965 --> 28:14.285
at a new idea at the moment,

28:14.325 --> 28:18.805
I'm looking at how can

28:14.325 --> 28:18.805
that idea navigate

28:14.325 --> 28:18.805
through those pressures.

28:20.485 --> 28:23.605
[Fred]<i> Michelin-starred chef</i>

28:20.485 --> 28:23.605
<i>and investor Atul Kochhar</i>

28:23.645 --> 28:26.565
<i>believes there's a strong</i>

28:23.645 --> 28:26.565
<i>market for fusion food.</i>

28:28.685 --> 28:32.245
The new generation,

28:28.685 --> 28:32.245
their definition of authentic

28:28.685 --> 28:32.245
is very, very different.

28:32.285 --> 28:33.605
<i>They want to have</i>

28:32.285 --> 28:33.605
<i>more flavors,</i>

28:33.645 --> 28:36.045
<i>they want to have</i>

28:33.645 --> 28:36.045
<i>more textures.</i>

28:36.085 --> 28:38.285
You have to come up

28:36.085 --> 28:38.285
with a great combination.

28:39.245 --> 28:40.885
<i>Baba G's is a quirky project.</i>

28:40.925 --> 28:44.725
He has inspired himself

28:40.925 --> 28:44.725
on India, but it's new India.

28:44.765 --> 28:48.245
Whether people in the UK

28:44.765 --> 28:48.245
will think it's authentic

28:44.765 --> 28:48.245
Indian or not,

28:48.285 --> 28:50.965
I don't think any one of us

28:48.285 --> 28:50.965
gives a toss about it,

28:48.285 --> 28:50.965
to be honest,

28:51.005 --> 28:52.805
<i>because we like our flavors.</i>

28:52.845 --> 28:56.965
British-Indian food Mark II,

28:52.845 --> 28:56.965
it's here. Baba G is that.

28:57.005 --> 29:01.445
[Fred]<i> Charlie McVeigh</i>

29:05.005 --> 29:07.765
I think there's very limited

29:05.005 --> 29:07.765
sectors in the market

29:07.805 --> 29:10.805
that don't enjoy eating burgers

29:07.805 --> 29:10.805
and don't enjoy

29:07.805 --> 29:10.805
eating Indian food.

29:10.845 --> 29:13.285
<i>You would expect</i>

29:10.845 --> 29:13.285

but also mums and dads

29:15.165 --> 29:18.805
with their kids.

29:18.845 --> 29:22.805
To get a business like Baba G's

29:18.845 --> 29:22.805
from its street-food origins

29:18.845 --> 29:22.805
into bricks and mortar

29:22.845 --> 29:26.525
could cost anything

29:22.845 --> 29:26.525
from Â£200,000 to Â£500,000.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.405
If the business plan is right,

29:26.565 --> 29:29.405
I will find that money.

29:31.405 --> 29:34.005
Okay, guys, we're gonna come

29:31.405 --> 29:34.005
and have a quick briefing,

29:34.045 --> 29:37.085

We are really used to

29:47.125 --> 29:50.005
like fast, quick service,

29:50.045 --> 29:51.525
but not as a sit-down.

29:51.565 --> 29:54.725

you're integral to

29:51.565 --> 29:54.725
our night running well.

29:54.765 --> 29:57.245
The idea is that

29:54.765 --> 29:57.245
we're still trying to be

29:54.765 --> 29:57.245
a fast food outlet

29:57.285 --> 29:59.765
so that everyone

29:57.285 --> 29:59.765
does have to sit

29:57.285 --> 29:59.765
at their seat,

29:59.805 --> 30:01.765
look through the menu

29:59.805 --> 30:01.765
and then go up to the bar

30:01.805 --> 30:03.125

but we've learned our trade

30:35.685 --> 30:37.765
the hard way, you know.

30:37.805 --> 30:41.125
We've done setting up

30:37.805 --> 30:41.125
in the snow, rain, the hail.

30:41.165 --> 30:43.925
<i>We wanna create</i>

30:41.165 --> 30:43.925
<i>a more secure future.</i>

30:43.965 --> 30:45.485
It's now or never, I'd say.

30:54.245 --> 30:57.885
[Fred]<i> Tonight</i>

30:54.245 --> 30:57.885
<i>a new restaurant is opening</i>

30:54.245 --> 30:57.885
<i>in Manchester. Baba G.</i>

30:57.925 --> 30:59.325
<i>The investors are coming in</i>

30:59.365 --> 31:01.445
and will be watching

30:59.365 --> 31:01.445
their every move.

31:01.485 --> 31:02.845
You ready?

31:02.885 --> 31:04.645
Everything ready?

31:02.885 --> 31:04.645
You ready?

31:04.685 --> 31:06.525
Everyone know

31:04.685 --> 31:06.525
what they're doing?

31:06.565 --> 31:08.765
Oh, this is the most

31:06.565 --> 31:08.765
nervous wait of my life.

31:09.765 --> 31:11.885
Good evening,

31:09.765 --> 31:11.885
welcome to Baba G's.

31:11.925 --> 31:13.085
Well, great. Come with me.

31:13.125 --> 31:15.725
I'm nervous. We've got

31:13.125 --> 31:15.725
our first customers!

31:15.765 --> 31:19.165
Idea is that you take a moment

31:15.765 --> 31:19.165
to make your order choice.

31:19.205 --> 31:22.405
Make your way up to

31:19.205 --> 31:22.405
the front to where the till is

31:19.205 --> 31:22.405
and place your order.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.685
So can we start with

31:22.445 --> 31:24.685
the Crazy Lamb Jalfrezi?

31:24.725 --> 31:25.965
Nice. Very nice.

31:26.005 --> 31:27.805
We've got a

31:26.005 --> 31:27.805
Crazy Lamb Jalfrezi...

31:27.845 --> 31:29.045
We'll have some Pachos.

31:29.085 --> 31:31.445
[waitress]

31:29.085 --> 31:31.445
Your paneer saag naan.

31:31.485 --> 31:33.045
I really like

31:31.485 --> 31:33.045
the fried chicken nuggets

31:33.085 --> 31:35.445
and then I have

31:33.085 --> 31:35.445
the same on this,

31:33.085 --> 31:35.445
it's like chicken tikka.

31:35.485 --> 31:36.605
How's it going?

31:36.645 --> 31:38.085
-It's beautiful.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.085
-Do you like it?

31:38.125 --> 31:39.445
[woman] That's amazing.

31:39.485 --> 31:42.005
Yeah, especially

31:39.485 --> 31:42.005
an Indian burger,

31:39.485 --> 31:42.005
it's really nice.

31:42.045 --> 31:44.525
It's clean and fresh.

31:42.045 --> 31:44.525
Really tasty.

31:44.565 --> 31:46.965
[Fred]<i> Baba G's</i>

31:44.565 --> 31:46.965
<i>is off to a flyer,</i>

31:47.005 --> 31:49.085

31:47.005 --> 31:49.085

31:49.125 --> 31:51.605
Have we got another table of

31:49.125 --> 31:51.605
two that have come in?

31:51.645 --> 31:53.605
I think table three

31:51.645 --> 31:53.605
in about five minutes.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.285
[Fred]<i> ...the kitchen</i>

31:53.645 --> 31:56.285
<i>has hit its first glitch.</i>

31:56.325 --> 31:57.725
Is this my

31:56.325 --> 31:57.725
chicken tikka naanwich?

31:57.765 --> 31:59.525
Yeah, uh...

31:59.565 --> 32:01.445
No. We're missing an order.

32:01.485 --> 32:02.965
We're missing an order.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.805
We've actually got a couple

32:03.005 --> 32:04.805
of missing orders here

32:04.845 --> 32:06.205
that have been put

32:04.845 --> 32:06.205
through as takeaway,

32:06.245 --> 32:08.605
but with actually

32:06.245 --> 32:08.605
no table numbers

32:06.245 --> 32:08.605
attached to them.

32:08.645 --> 32:10.485
You already had some food or...

32:10.525 --> 32:13.845
No, just waiting now.

32:10.525 --> 32:13.845
Think it's on the bench

32:10.525 --> 32:13.845
ready to come out.

32:13.885 --> 32:16.685
Let me just check.

32:13.885 --> 32:16.685
You're table nine.

32:13.885 --> 32:16.685
Give me one second.

32:18.285 --> 32:19.925
What's happening

32:18.285 --> 32:19.925
with all of this?

32:19.965 --> 32:22.165
Look, people are

32:19.965 --> 32:22.165
giving us orders

32:19.965 --> 32:22.165
without table numbers.

32:22.205 --> 32:24.365
Table nine, please,

32:22.205 --> 32:24.365
how long?

32:24.405 --> 32:27.125
[Alec]

32:24.405 --> 32:27.125
We've got a lot of orders

32:24.405 --> 32:27.125
without table numbers on.

32:27.165 --> 32:30.085
Order 27 no table number,

32:27.165 --> 32:30.085
order 21 no table number,

32:30.125 --> 32:32.845
order 29 no table number!

32:32.885 --> 32:35.765
Table nine has ordered

32:32.885 --> 32:35.765
half an hour ago,

32:32.885 --> 32:35.765
that's why I'm asking.

32:35.805 --> 32:37.445
Would you mind

32:35.805 --> 32:37.445
to check table nine there,

32:37.485 --> 32:40.565
what did they order

32:37.485 --> 32:40.565
and where is the order

32:37.485 --> 32:40.565
because it's not here,

32:40.605 --> 32:42.085
and they arrived

32:40.605 --> 32:42.085
half an hour ago.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.405
-Give me a second, yeah.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.405
-Yeah.

32:44.485 --> 32:46.485
Right.

32:46.525 --> 32:48.245
-What table are you, madam?

32:46.525 --> 32:48.245
-Number eleven.

32:48.565 --> 32:49.685
Nice.

32:49.725 --> 32:51.885
One mango spice slaw

32:51.925 --> 32:54.485
and one chicken tikka

32:51.925 --> 32:54.485
nuggets sides please.

32:54.525 --> 32:58.485
[Fred]<i> Staff are now</i>

32:54.525 --> 32:58.485
<i>making sure every order</i>

32:54.525 --> 32:58.485
<i>is given a table number,</i>

32:58.525 --> 33:02.645
<i>but the delay to service</i>

32:58.525 --> 33:02.645
<i>has highlighted</i>

32:58.525 --> 33:02.645
<i>a much bigger problem.</i>

33:02.685 --> 33:04.685
There's a little bit of

33:02.685 --> 33:04.685
a wait on the table.

33:04.725 --> 33:07.165
If I can get you

33:04.725 --> 33:07.165
to take a seat.

33:07.205 --> 33:09.285
We thought that

33:07.205 --> 33:09.285
it was going to be more

33:07.205 --> 33:09.285
like the street food,

33:09.325 --> 33:11.845
where people are in and out

33:09.325 --> 33:11.845
within 30 minutes.

33:11.885 --> 33:14.365
<i>Once you put a plate</i>

33:11.885 --> 33:14.365
<i>in front of them,</i>

33:11.885 --> 33:14.365

33:14.405 --> 33:16.525
<i>People are relaxing,</i>

33:14.405 --> 33:16.525
<i>especially in an evening,</i>

33:16.565 --> 33:18.605

33:16.565 --> 33:18.605
<i>to turn the table.</i>

33:18.645 --> 33:21.325
It's been about 45 minutes

33:18.645 --> 33:21.325
we've been waiting.

33:21.365 --> 33:23.405
-Since you arrived?

33:21.365 --> 33:23.405
-Since I arrived.

33:23.445 --> 33:25.885
Ordered two drinks.

33:23.445 --> 33:25.885
Haven't received one,

33:25.925 --> 33:27.925
still haven't been seated.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.885
[Fred]<i> Customers are</i>

33:27.965 --> 33:29.885
<i>growing impatient.</i>

33:30.885 --> 33:32.805
<i>But Liz has been smart.</i>

33:32.845 --> 33:34.765
<i>She's kept one table free.</i>

33:41.005 --> 33:42.805
<i>7:30.</i>

33:42.845 --> 33:46.365
<i>The investors are here</i>

<i>to find out if Baba G's</i>

33:42.845 --> 33:46.365
<i>is worth their money.</i>

33:47.765 --> 33:49.085
When groups of people

33:47.765 --> 33:49.085
come out,

33:49.125 --> 33:51.405
we look out for something

33:49.125 --> 33:51.405
which we call the handbrake.

33:51.445 --> 33:53.285
<i>There's usually one person</i>

33:53.325 --> 33:55.805
<i>who doesn't like</i>

33:53.325 --> 33:55.805
<i>the core offer,</i>

33:55.845 --> 33:57.365
<i>doesn't like burgers,</i>

33:57.405 --> 33:59.285
<i>and unless you can</i>

33:57.405 --> 33:59.285
<i>cater for that person,</i>

33:59.325 --> 34:02.845
they will cause the handbrake,

33:59.325 --> 34:02.845
they will stop that whole

33:59.325 --> 34:02.845
group from going out.

34:02.885 --> 34:05.565
<i>So I want to make sure</i>

34:02.885 --> 34:05.565
<i>that they can cater</i>

34:05.605 --> 34:09.125
for people that don't want

34:05.605 --> 34:09.125
their core burger offer.

34:09.165 --> 34:10.645
-Hello!

34:09.165 --> 34:10.645
-Hello.

34:10.685 --> 34:12.405
Hello, there. Are you okay?

34:12.445 --> 34:14.125
[Liz] Been waiting for

34:12.445 --> 34:14.125
you three gentlemen.

34:14.165 --> 34:16.285
I do see

34:14.165 --> 34:16.285
that Charlie and Jamie

34:16.325 --> 34:19.045
would come and compete

34:16.325 --> 34:19.045
with me on this one.

34:16.325 --> 34:19.045
No doubt about it.

34:19.085 --> 34:22.165
But if I like the idea enough,

34:19.085 --> 34:22.165
I will fight very hard for it.

34:22.205 --> 34:24.645
-Hampers all ready

34:22.205 --> 34:24.645
waiting for you.

34:22.205 --> 34:24.645
-Where do you want us?

34:24.685 --> 34:26.805
I've come here

34:24.685 --> 34:26.805
to find an investment.

34:26.845 --> 34:31.005
If I'm interested, I'm sure

34:26.845 --> 34:31.005
there will be other investors

34:26.845 --> 34:31.005
that will be interested.

34:31.045 --> 34:33.005
So this is an

34:31.045 --> 34:33.005
experience and a half.

34:33.045 --> 34:34.205
-Yeah!

34:33.045 --> 34:34.205
-I have to say.

34:34.245 --> 34:37.765
I'm a fan of Jamie Barber

34:34.245 --> 34:37.765
and of Atul Kochhar,

34:37.805 --> 34:41.325
but if you don't wanna

34:37.805 --> 34:41.325
beat the other guy,

34:37.805 --> 34:41.325
why are you doing it?

34:41.365 --> 34:43.245
So your table number

34:41.365 --> 34:43.245
is number ten.

34:43.285 --> 34:44.805
So you just need

34:43.285 --> 34:44.805
to let them know.

34:44.845 --> 34:47.125
Is that how you do it?

34:44.845 --> 34:47.125
You can order at the till?

34:47.165 --> 34:50.045
And turning to the side

34:47.165 --> 34:50.045
you see a queue over there.

34:50.085 --> 34:53.365
Can I leave you gentlemen

34:50.085 --> 34:53.365
to order and I will go

34:50.085 --> 34:53.365
and deal with them?

34:53.405 --> 34:55.805
-Best of luck.

34:53.405 --> 34:55.805
-Thank you.

34:55.845 --> 34:58.205
[Charlie] I'm quite impressed

34:55.845 --> 34:58.205
with the menu.

34:55.845 --> 34:58.205
I think it looks good.

34:58.245 --> 35:02.565
It's interesting, but it's not

34:58.245 --> 35:02.565
so wacky that you're frightened

34:58.245 --> 35:02.565
or threatened by it.

35:02.605 --> 35:04.965
You kind of instinctively

35:02.605 --> 35:04.965
know what everything is.

35:05.005 --> 35:07.085
[Atul] Let's do it, guys.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.285
There we go.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.285
Another portion of nuggets.

35:09.325 --> 35:11.365
One sec. The next order

35:09.325 --> 35:11.365
is the investors, yeah.

35:11.405 --> 35:13.125
It's gonna come now.

35:13.165 --> 35:16.805
I mean, I always find

35:13.165 --> 35:16.805
this quite irritating,

35:13.165 --> 35:16.805
this part of the journey.

35:16.845 --> 35:18.005
[Atul] To order?

35:18.045 --> 35:20.485
But I know that people

35:18.045 --> 35:20.485
are accustomed to it.

35:20.525 --> 35:22.405
-Hi. Table ten.

35:20.525 --> 35:22.405
-Hi, guys. I am ready.

35:22.445 --> 35:24.525
Thank you so much,

35:22.445 --> 35:24.525
table number ten.

35:24.925 --> 35:26.125
Okay.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.165
Okay, so investor order.

35:28.205 --> 35:32.125
One Crazy Lamb Jalfrezi,

35:28.205 --> 35:32.125
one chikka tikken burger,

35:32.165 --> 35:33.765
one Naga deli burger.

35:33.805 --> 35:37.325
And some milkshakes, please.

35:33.805 --> 35:37.325
I'll have the vanilla

35:33.805 --> 35:37.325
cardamom one

35:37.365 --> 35:39.125
and the baba

35:37.365 --> 35:39.125
chocolate chai as well.

35:39.165 --> 35:41.365
The club naanwich,

35:39.165 --> 35:41.365
the tikka fried naanwich,

35:41.405 --> 35:43.405

the Baba Bowl,

35:43.445 --> 35:46.005

and the mango spice slaw.

35:46.045 --> 35:47.365
[chef]

35:46.045 --> 35:47.365
We make one of everything.

35:47.405 --> 35:48.605
One of everything, yeah.

35:48.645 --> 35:49.685
Do you mind paying?

35:49.725 --> 35:51.245
We've gotta pay, yeah.

35:51.285 --> 35:53.405
I don't have any...

35:51.285 --> 35:53.405
[chuckles]

35:53.445 --> 35:55.245
-Atul.

35:53.445 --> 35:55.245

36:05.005 --> 36:06.725
and just asked people,

36:06.765 --> 36:09.685
so people are starting

36:06.765 --> 36:09.685
to share tables when

36:06.765 --> 36:09.685
they become available.

36:09.725 --> 36:12.525
What's happening

36:09.725 --> 36:12.525
is you're coming for

36:09.725 --> 36:12.525
a romantic date here.

36:12.565 --> 36:14.845
And then you end up

36:12.565 --> 36:14.845
as a foursome now.

36:14.885 --> 36:16.525
So why are you

36:14.885 --> 36:16.525
sharing a table?

36:16.565 --> 36:19.205
They asked us whether

36:16.565 --> 36:19.205
or not we'd like to wait

36:16.565 --> 36:19.205
for a table for two,

36:19.245 --> 36:21.765
or if we wouldn't

36:19.245 --> 36:21.765
mind a share, so...

36:21.805 --> 36:24.645
Oh, well, that's

36:21.805 --> 36:24.645
quite a good solution.

36:24.685 --> 36:26.205
At least you're

36:24.685 --> 36:26.205
gonna get to eat.

36:26.245 --> 36:27.805
Yes, finally.

36:27.845 --> 36:30.765
<i>I mean, let's be honest here.</i>

36:27.845 --> 36:30.765
<i>It's really chaotic,</i>

36:30.805 --> 36:33.045
<i>but Liz and Alec</i>

36:30.805 --> 36:33.045
<i>are being creative.</i>

36:33.085 --> 36:35.645
They're finding solutions,

36:33.085 --> 36:35.645
and people are still happy.

36:35.685 --> 36:39.445
They love the food.

36:35.685 --> 36:39.445
So what's not to love

36:35.685 --> 36:39.445
about Baba G's?

36:39.485 --> 36:41.925
[Alec] Okay,

36:39.485 --> 36:41.925
everything perfect, mate.

36:41.965 --> 36:44.085
Investor burgers, yeah.

36:44.125 --> 36:46.125
[Charlie] What we haven't

36:44.125 --> 36:46.125
discussed is the drinks list,

36:46.165 --> 36:48.405
which is a revelation,

36:46.165 --> 36:48.405
and it's something that

36:48.445 --> 36:50.205
we asked for

36:48.445 --> 36:50.205
a couple of weeks ago

36:50.245 --> 36:51.605
and it shows that

36:50.245 --> 36:51.605
they're very responsive.

36:51.645 --> 36:53.485
-[Atul] They are responsive.

36:51.645 --> 36:53.485
-I think it's good.

36:53.525 --> 36:54.605
I think it's good.

36:54.645 --> 36:56.245
Chicken burger.

36:56.285 --> 36:58.485
We're gonna kind of share

36:56.285 --> 36:58.485
everything in a very,

36:56.285 --> 36:58.485
very intimate way.

36:58.525 --> 37:00.285
So is it all right to just

36:58.525 --> 37:00.285
put them in the middle?

37:00.325 --> 37:01.845
I don't watch

37:00.325 --> 37:01.845
anybody eat my food,

37:01.885 --> 37:03.965
so I'm certainly

37:01.885 --> 37:03.965
not going to watch

37:01.885 --> 37:03.965
the investors eat my food.

37:04.005 --> 37:06.325
[Charlie]

37:04.005 --> 37:06.325
The best-looking burger

37:04.005 --> 37:06.325
is the vegetarian burger.

37:06.365 --> 37:08.565
-[Atul] Quality is there.

37:06.365 --> 37:08.565
-You're in business

37:06.365 --> 37:08.565
at the moment.

37:08.605 --> 37:10.325
Oh, look, here comes

37:08.605 --> 37:10.325
the Baba Bowl.

37:10.365 --> 37:12.965
As a vegan, again,

37:10.365 --> 37:12.965
you're getting the best

37:10.365 --> 37:12.965
looking dish in the house.

37:13.005 --> 37:14.765
It's really, really cool.

37:14.805 --> 37:17.165
Now that looks good.

37:14.805 --> 37:17.165
Beautifully cooked.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.445
-This is terrific.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.445
-Really good.

37:22.765 --> 37:25.645
So, last time I spoke

37:22.765 --> 37:25.645
to them I found the...

37:25.685 --> 37:28.205
The grind quite coarse.

37:28.245 --> 37:30.565
And it certainly

37:28.245 --> 37:30.565
seems finer.

37:30.605 --> 37:32.005
I think it needs

37:30.605 --> 37:32.005
more salt.

37:32.845 --> 37:35.005
It needs more seasoning.

37:35.045 --> 37:36.605
-How are you guys?

37:35.045 --> 37:36.605
-Hello.

37:37.165 --> 37:38.405
So...

37:38.445 --> 37:40.205
So, listen, we were just saying

37:38.445 --> 37:40.205
that on the whole

37:40.245 --> 37:43.285
I think they pulled off

37:40.245 --> 37:43.285
a very impressive show.

37:43.325 --> 37:45.165
-Definitely.

37:43.325 --> 37:45.165
-It's very busy.

37:45.205 --> 37:46.205
[Jamie] It's great fun.

37:46.245 --> 37:48.605
The service is

37:46.245 --> 37:48.605
as chaotic as it gets.

37:48.645 --> 37:51.445
People have been sharing tables

37:48.645 --> 37:51.445
with people they didn't know.

37:51.485 --> 37:54.685
I tell you something,

37:51.485 --> 37:54.685
I mean, they are

37:51.485 --> 37:54.685
really ambitious.

37:54.725 --> 37:56.445
The food, it was great,

37:56.485 --> 37:58.285
-but not everything

37:56.485 --> 37:58.285
is perfect.

37:56.485 --> 37:58.285
-Sure.

37:58.325 --> 38:01.085
So there are lots of things

37:58.325 --> 38:01.085
which needs tweaking.

38:01.125 --> 38:04.605
I think little tweaks

38:01.125 --> 38:04.605
here and there, and you've

38:01.125 --> 38:04.605
got a concept here.

38:04.645 --> 38:06.245
I'm really not worried

38:04.645 --> 38:06.245
about the service,

38:06.285 --> 38:07.565
I think they've done

38:06.285 --> 38:07.565
an amazing job.

38:07.605 --> 38:09.485
I've got issues

38:07.605 --> 38:09.485
with the price point.

38:09.525 --> 38:12.245
I think Â£12.50

38:09.525 --> 38:12.245
for a burger and fries

38:12.285 --> 38:14.405
in a lot of parts of the UK

38:12.285 --> 38:14.405
is gonna be too much.

38:14.445 --> 38:17.125
However, I thought

38:14.445 --> 38:17.125
it was going to be

38:14.445 --> 38:17.125
a complete car crash.

38:17.165 --> 38:18.925
-[Jamie] I agree.

38:17.165 --> 38:18.925
-Tonight.

38:18.965 --> 38:21.405
And it's far from it.

38:18.965 --> 38:21.405
Yes, there have been some

38:18.965 --> 38:21.405
tables waiting and so on,

38:21.445 --> 38:23.405
but I've also seen

38:21.445 --> 38:23.405
lots of people

38:21.445 --> 38:23.405
enjoying the food.

38:26.125 --> 38:30.365
I'm excited about it.

38:26.125 --> 38:30.365
I've never felt a really

38:30.405 --> 38:32.565
deep connection

38:30.405 --> 38:32.565
to the brand.

38:33.725 --> 38:35.765
I like the food,

38:33.725 --> 38:35.765
I don't love it.

38:35.805 --> 38:39.765
So, for me,

38:35.805 --> 38:39.765
it's gonna come down to,

38:35.805 --> 38:39.765
do the numbers stack up?

38:39.805 --> 38:40.765
[Charlie]

38:39.805 --> 38:40.765
Alec, how you doing?

38:40.805 --> 38:42.245
You're not even sweating.

38:42.285 --> 38:43.685
[laughing]

38:43.725 --> 38:46.165
In terms of food,

38:43.725 --> 38:46.165
the presentation,

38:46.205 --> 38:50.165
the way they have

38:46.205 --> 38:50.165
conceptualized the dishes,

38:46.205 --> 38:50.165
they're all very good.

38:50.205 --> 38:52.685
<i>There are small tweaks</i>

38:50.205 --> 38:52.685
<i>to be had, no doubt about it,</i>

38:52.725 --> 38:55.405
but otherwise,

38:52.725 --> 38:55.405
very impressive experience.

38:55.445 --> 38:58.805
You guys have put out

38:55.445 --> 38:58.805
very high-quality food...

38:58.845 --> 39:01.045
-Oh, thank you.

38:58.845 --> 39:01.045
-...in a crazy setting.

39:01.085 --> 39:02.845
[Jamie]<i> I think</i>

39:01.085 --> 39:02.845
<i>dinner was very tasty.</i>

39:02.885 --> 39:04.725
Yes, I was impressed

39:02.885 --> 39:04.725
with the food.

39:04.765 --> 39:07.085
<i>Yes, I was impressed</i>

39:04.765 --> 39:07.085
<i>by the execution,</i>

39:07.125 --> 39:11.445
but I've still

39:07.125 --> 39:11.445
got to be impressed

39:07.125 --> 39:11.445
by their financial acumen.

39:11.485 --> 39:14.165
[Alec] Anybody else

39:11.485 --> 39:14.165
want a drink?

39:11.485 --> 39:14.165
I need one.

39:14.205 --> 39:15.405
-Well done.

39:14.205 --> 39:15.405
-Cheers.

39:15.445 --> 39:17.765
Well done.

39:17.805 --> 39:21.525
Wow, that was a tough night,

39:17.805 --> 39:21.525
but you've got to give it

39:17.805 --> 39:21.525
to Liz and Alec.

39:21.565 --> 39:23.245
They gave it all they had.

39:23.285 --> 39:26.245
And they impressed me,

39:23.285 --> 39:26.245
and I think that they've

39:23.285 --> 39:26.245
impressed the investors.

39:26.285 --> 39:28.565
They're still in the running

39:26.285 --> 39:28.565
for that investment tomorrow.

39:37.405 --> 39:38.885
[Fred]<i> It's the final day,</i>

39:38.925 --> 39:41.125
<i>but things aren't about</i>

39:38.925 --> 39:41.125
<i>to get any easier.</i>

39:43.205 --> 39:47.925
<i>In a few hours,</i>

39:43.205 --> 39:47.925
<i>the investors will be back</i>

39:43.205 --> 39:47.925
<i>for another full service.</i>

39:47.965 --> 39:51.605
<i>They will want to know</i>

39:47.965 --> 39:51.605
<i>how Baba G's performs</i>

39:47.965 --> 39:51.605
<i>as a lunchtime option.</i>

39:54.005 --> 39:57.245
<i>But first, Liz and Alec</i>

39:54.005 --> 39:57.245
<i>face business meetings</i>

39:57.285 --> 40:00.325
<i>to interrogate their</i>

39:57.285 --> 40:00.325
<i>financial strategy.</i>

40:00.365 --> 40:02.965
<i>As the investors</i>

40:00.365 --> 40:02.965
<i>are in competition</i>

40:00.365 --> 40:02.965
<i>with each other,</i>

40:03.005 --> 40:07.045
<i>they'll each have an hour</i>

40:03.005 --> 40:07.045
<i>alone with the couple.</i>

40:07.085 --> 40:10.685
[Jamie]<i> I've seen a very small</i>

40:07.085 --> 40:10.685
<i>snapshot of what these</i>

40:07.085 --> 40:10.685
<i>guys can put across.</i>

40:10.725 --> 40:13.685
I'm excited about

40:10.725 --> 40:13.685
what I've seen, but there's

40:13.725 --> 40:16.445
a large number

40:13.725 --> 40:16.445
of unanswered questions.

40:16.485 --> 40:19.485
I like the concept,

40:16.485 --> 40:19.485
I like the people,

40:16.485 --> 40:19.485
I like their integrity.

40:19.525 --> 40:22.125
<i>But each and every business</i>

40:19.525 --> 40:22.125
<i>is run by the numbers.</i>

40:22.165 --> 40:24.565
If I was to invest money,

40:22.165 --> 40:24.565
can I trust them?

40:24.605 --> 40:27.525
[Charlie]

40:24.605 --> 40:27.525
<i>It's vitally important</i>

40:24.605 --> 40:27.525
<i>they know how to make money.</i>

40:27.565 --> 40:30.165
<i>If they can't deliver profit,</i>

40:30.205 --> 40:33.525
not only will they not be

40:30.205 --> 40:33.525
able to grow the business,

40:30.205 --> 40:33.525
they're gonna go bankrupt.

40:35.605 --> 40:40.845
[Fred]<i> Liz and Alec came</i>

40:35.605 --> 40:40.845
<i>looking for Â£300,000</i>

40:35.605 --> 40:40.845
<i>to open two sites.</i>

40:42.005 --> 40:44.325
<i>But if their figures</i>

40:42.005 --> 40:44.325
<i>don't impress,</i>

40:44.365 --> 40:47.325
<i>the investors</i>

40:44.365 --> 40:47.325
<i>could walk away.</i>

40:47.365 --> 40:49.365
Let me make

40:47.365 --> 40:49.365
a couple of comments

40:47.365 --> 40:49.365
about the business plan,

40:49.405 --> 40:52.645
which I suspect

40:49.405 --> 40:52.645
you're going to have to

40:49.405 --> 40:52.645
rip up and start again.

40:52.685 --> 40:56.685
Last night you took Â£3,000-ish?

40:52.685 --> 40:56.685
Does that sound about right?

40:56.725 --> 40:58.885
And you were absolutely packed.

40:58.925 --> 41:00.725
What your business plan

40:58.925 --> 41:00.725
is presenting

41:00.765 --> 41:03.005
means that you have to do

41:00.765 --> 41:03.005
what you did last night,

41:03.045 --> 41:07.045
and more, lunch and dinner

41:03.045 --> 41:07.045
every day, seven days a week.

41:07.085 --> 41:09.605
So, that ain't gonna work.

41:11.485 --> 41:13.165
What I'm concerned about is

41:13.205 --> 41:16.285
300K will let you open

41:13.205 --> 41:16.285
two more sites

41:16.325 --> 41:18.685
and those places would pump,

41:18.725 --> 41:21.565
you are saying 3.7 million.

41:21.605 --> 41:23.645
You know,

41:21.605 --> 41:23.645
it's projections and...

41:23.685 --> 41:25.325
[Atul]

41:23.685 --> 41:25.325
I totally understand.

41:25.365 --> 41:27.005
But these are the numbers

41:25.365 --> 41:27.005
I'm looking at.

41:27.045 --> 41:28.365
[Alec] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:28.405 --> 41:29.925
These are the numbers

41:28.405 --> 41:29.925
you have given me to look at.

41:29.965 --> 41:31.805
I've got to say

41:29.965 --> 41:31.805
whether I want to invest

41:29.965 --> 41:31.805
with you or not.

41:31.845 --> 41:34.245
Totally understand, yes.

41:34.285 --> 41:37.965
Alec and Liz are doing

41:34.285 --> 41:37.965
all they can to give

41:34.285 --> 41:37.965
a good impression in there.

41:38.005 --> 41:39.845
<i>They believe in the concept,</i>

41:39.885 --> 41:41.645
<i>but will the investors</i>

41:39.885 --> 41:41.645
<i>feel the same?</i>

41:43.125 --> 41:45.485
[Charlie]

41:43.125 --> 41:45.485
So the fundamental

41:43.125 --> 41:45.485
issue I've got

41:45.525 --> 41:46.885
is what this thing's

41:45.525 --> 41:46.885
gonna be.

41:46.925 --> 41:50.045
What is the model?

41:46.925 --> 41:50.045
What's the customer journey?

41:50.085 --> 41:53.605
I'm gonna put the bar here,

41:50.085 --> 41:53.605
let's get a sign here

41:50.085 --> 41:53.605
so that when they walk in...

41:53.645 --> 41:56.205
Put it in the business plan

41:53.645 --> 41:56.205
and say this is what

41:53.645 --> 41:56.205
we're gonna do.

41:56.245 --> 41:57.245
-Okay.

41:56.245 --> 41:57.245
-Right.

41:57.285 --> 42:00.085
And then, I look at that

41:57.285 --> 42:00.085
and I go, "Oh!

42:00.125 --> 42:02.045
-They know what they're doing!"

42:00.125 --> 42:02.045
-[Alec] Yeah.

42:02.085 --> 42:04.165
I don't know if you know

42:02.085 --> 42:04.165
what you're doing.

42:04.205 --> 42:06.685
<i>The quality of the food</i>

42:04.205 --> 42:06.685
<i>is important,</i>

42:06.725 --> 42:10.605
but it's actually only

42:06.725 --> 42:10.605
quite a small part

42:06.725 --> 42:10.605
of the overall package.

42:10.645 --> 42:13.725
What I want to see is what

42:10.645 --> 42:13.725
the customer experience is

42:13.765 --> 42:16.445
and how that translates

42:13.765 --> 42:16.445
into the numbers,

42:13.765 --> 42:16.445
and I haven't had that yet.

42:16.485 --> 42:18.205
We've got a very clear vision,

42:18.245 --> 42:21.725
but it's just about

42:18.245 --> 42:21.725
having the time to actually

42:18.245 --> 42:21.725
sit down and do it,

42:21.765 --> 42:24.165
while running all other

42:21.765 --> 42:24.165
parts of your business.

42:24.205 --> 42:26.085
The issue I have with that,

42:26.125 --> 42:27.765
it's not a good excuse

42:27.805 --> 42:30.405
because there's nothing

42:27.805 --> 42:30.405
more important than

42:27.805 --> 42:30.405
getting this right.

42:31.045 --> 42:32.725
Yeah.

42:32.765 --> 42:35.005
I think you've got many

42:32.765 --> 42:35.005
of the right ingredients,

42:35.045 --> 42:38.965
but until I really have

42:35.045 --> 42:38.965
a sense and an idea

42:35.045 --> 42:38.965
of what are the fails,

42:39.005 --> 42:41.725
what are the profits

42:39.005 --> 42:41.725
from that business,

42:39.005 --> 42:41.725
how's it all gonna work?

42:43.125 --> 42:44.125
I don't think I can invest.

42:45.165 --> 42:46.165
Okay.

42:49.245 --> 42:50.685
I can help with the numbers.

42:50.725 --> 42:52.445
But ultimately,

42:50.725 --> 42:52.445
I've got no idea

42:52.485 --> 42:55.005
<i>whether they actually</i>

42:52.485 --> 42:55.005
<i>understand their business</i>

42:52.485 --> 42:55.005
<i>model or not.</i>

42:55.045 --> 42:57.645
If I got a feeling

42:55.045 --> 42:57.645
that they really got

42:57.685 --> 43:01.005
what could happen

42:57.685 --> 43:01.005
in one restaurant,

43:01.045 --> 43:02.685
how that restaurant's gonna be,

43:02.725 --> 43:05.125
how much money

43:02.725 --> 43:05.125
it's gonna make,

43:02.725 --> 43:05.125
and it was believable,

43:06.045 --> 43:07.165
I'd be in.

43:07.205 --> 43:09.125
But they've given me

43:07.205 --> 43:09.125
no such impression.

43:10.125 --> 43:11.605
[Liz]

43:10.125 --> 43:11.605
<i>That was stressful.</i>

43:11.645 --> 43:14.325
We were talked at

43:11.645 --> 43:14.325
a lot more than us

43:11.645 --> 43:14.325
being able to contribute.

43:14.365 --> 43:15.965
[Alec] Yeah.

43:16.005 --> 43:18.205
[Liz]

43:16.005 --> 43:18.205
<i>Alec and I feel very sure</i>

43:16.005 --> 43:18.205
<i>of our vision of Baba G's.</i>

43:18.245 --> 43:19.845
We know what we want

43:18.245 --> 43:19.845
our customers to feel,

43:19.885 --> 43:21.725
but we just haven't

43:19.885 --> 43:21.725
articulated it.

43:22.605 --> 43:24.685
[Fred]<i> Charlie might be gone,</i>

43:24.725 --> 43:28.405
<i>but the remaining investors</i>

43:24.725 --> 43:28.405
<i>can choose to spell out</i>

43:24.725 --> 43:28.405
<i>the offer they would make if,</i>

43:28.445 --> 43:32.845
<i>and only if,</i>

43:28.445 --> 43:32.845
<i>they decide to invest tonight.</i>

43:32.885 --> 43:38.285
<i>Jamie believes that Liz</i>

43:32.885 --> 43:38.285
<i>and Alec have overestimated</i>

43:32.885 --> 43:38.285
<i>their potential sales,</i>

43:38.325 --> 43:41.205
<i>so he's got a plan</i>

43:38.325 --> 43:41.205
<i>to minimize the risk.</i>

43:41.245 --> 43:43.645
The casual dining market

43:41.245 --> 43:43.645
is distressed at the moment,

43:43.685 --> 43:45.885
and there are lots

43:43.685 --> 43:45.885
of opportunities to pick up

43:45.925 --> 43:49.885
somebody else's failed

43:45.925 --> 43:49.885
fully fitted-out restaurant

43:45.925 --> 43:49.885
for very little money.

43:49.925 --> 43:52.285
Because even

43:49.925 --> 43:52.285
1,000 square-foot restaurant

43:49.925 --> 43:52.285
you're gonna end up spending

43:52.325 --> 43:55.405
several hundred thousand pounds

43:52.325 --> 43:55.405
on fitting that out

43:52.325 --> 43:55.405
as a restaurant.

43:55.445 --> 43:57.485
So, if I was minded

43:55.445 --> 43:57.485
to make an offer,

43:57.525 --> 44:02.085
I think it would be

43:57.525 --> 44:02.085
in the region of Â£150,000

43:57.525 --> 44:02.085
to Â£200,000

44:03.045 --> 44:05.205
to establish a first unit.

44:05.245 --> 44:06.965
But I wanna see today

44:07.005 --> 44:11.525
whether the guests

44:07.005 --> 44:11.525
respond to your food

44:11.565 --> 44:13.285
as a kind of

44:11.565 --> 44:13.285
lunchtime visit

44:13.325 --> 44:15.045
as well as just an

44:13.325 --> 44:15.045
evening experience.

44:15.085 --> 44:17.325
-[Alec] Yeah, thank you.

44:15.085 --> 44:17.325
-Yeah.

44:17.365 --> 44:20.685
The business plan

44:17.365 --> 44:20.685
that they had presented

44:17.365 --> 44:20.685
was fiction.

44:20.725 --> 44:24.245
<i>However, their fundamental</i>

44:20.725 --> 44:24.245
<i>proposition is clever,</i>

44:24.285 --> 44:27.765
and I think I've got

44:24.285 --> 44:27.765
a good sense as to what their

44:24.285 --> 44:27.765
margins should be or could be.

44:27.805 --> 44:30.525
<i>So I think if you put</i>

44:27.805 --> 44:30.525
<i>the normal restaurant</i>

44:27.805 --> 44:30.525
<i>metrics behind it,</i>

44:30.565 --> 44:33.125
you can make

44:30.565 --> 44:33.125
a successful business

44:30.565 --> 44:33.125
from this proposition.

44:33.805 --> 44:35.045
[Atul] Going forward,

44:36.085 --> 44:38.285
if I was to invest in this,

44:38.325 --> 44:40.805
I would invest 300,000.

44:40.845 --> 44:44.805
That'll get you started

44:40.845 --> 44:44.805
with two sites at least,

44:40.845 --> 44:44.805
as you have mentioned.

44:44.845 --> 44:47.965
But I would love

44:44.845 --> 44:47.965
to come back for lunch today

44:48.925 --> 44:51.645
and see how food comes out.

44:51.685 --> 44:53.565
The consistency

44:51.685 --> 44:53.565
has to be there.

44:53.605 --> 44:55.325
-That's what I want to see.

44:53.605 --> 44:55.325
-Yes.

44:57.125 --> 44:58.405
How you doing?

44:58.445 --> 44:59.805
[Vanina]

44:58.445 --> 44:59.805
Very well, how are you?

44:59.845 --> 45:02.645
So we've got

44:59.845 --> 45:02.645
two investors coming,

44:59.845 --> 45:02.645
one's dropped out.

45:02.685 --> 45:06.365
Did they say why they're out

45:02.685 --> 45:06.365
and any improvements?

45:06.405 --> 45:09.205
Uh, there's nothing

45:06.405 --> 45:09.205
we can do now.

45:09.245 --> 45:11.845
[Alec] Okay, guys.

45:09.245 --> 45:11.845
It's 2:00!

45:11.885 --> 45:13.165
Service starting!

45:13.205 --> 45:15.925
[Fred]<i> Liz and Alec</i>

45:13.205 --> 45:15.925
<i>are about to open for lunch.</i>

45:15.965 --> 45:17.165
[Liz] Hello, there,

45:15.965 --> 45:17.165
how are you doing?

45:17.205 --> 45:19.645
-Can I take your name?

45:17.205 --> 45:19.645
-Emily.

45:19.685 --> 45:21.205
[Liz]<i> To come through</i>

45:19.685 --> 45:21.205
<i>this experience,</i>

45:21.245 --> 45:23.405
the more you go through it

45:21.245 --> 45:23.405
the more you want it.

45:23.445 --> 45:24.765
The more you realize

45:25.805 --> 45:27.605
<i>being in an area like this,</i>

45:27.645 --> 45:30.405
<i>seeing all the big brands</i>

45:27.645 --> 45:30.405
<i>and seeing this outcome</i>

45:30.445 --> 45:33.285
could mean that we are

45:30.445 --> 45:33.285
up there among them

45:30.445 --> 45:33.285
in the years to come.

45:33.325 --> 45:36.525
Yeah. This is the difference

45:33.325 --> 45:36.525
between us

45:36.565 --> 45:39.325
getting investment

45:36.565 --> 45:39.325
and not getting investment.

45:39.365 --> 45:42.525
[Fred]<i> Today, the public</i>

45:39.365 --> 45:42.525
<i>will pay full price.</i>

45:42.565 --> 45:44.445
[Liz] Hi, guys.

45:42.565 --> 45:44.445
Welcome to Baba G.

45:44.485 --> 45:47.725
[Fred]<i> And the investors</i>

45:44.485 --> 45:47.725
<i>will be want to know what</i>

45:44.485 --> 45:47.725
<i>they make of Baba G's.</i>

45:47.765 --> 45:49.085
The Crazy Lamb Jalfrezi burger?

45:49.125 --> 45:50.365
It seems a lot calmer.

45:50.405 --> 45:51.885
I think people know

45:50.405 --> 45:51.885
what they're doing.

45:51.925 --> 45:54.885
One Lamb Jalfrezi,

45:51.925 --> 45:54.885
one club naanwich.

45:54.925 --> 45:56.085
I don't know what's

45:54.925 --> 45:56.085
in this but it's gorgeous.

45:57.165 --> 46:00.165
It's spicy, beautiful,

45:57.165 --> 46:00.165
juicy, nice.

46:00.205 --> 46:02.845
[Fred]<i> Atul and Jamie</i>

46:00.205 --> 46:02.845
<i>both need good answers</i>

46:02.885 --> 46:06.205
<i>to big questions</i>

46:02.885 --> 46:06.205
<i>if they are to invest tonight.</i>

46:06.245 --> 46:09.045
No restaurant at the moment

46:06.245 --> 46:09.045
can afford to survive

46:09.085 --> 46:11.325
on Thursday, Friday

46:09.085 --> 46:11.325
and Saturday nights.

46:11.365 --> 46:12.965
Those days are over.

46:13.005 --> 46:16.925
These restaurants

46:13.005 --> 46:16.925
need to sweat every hour

46:13.005 --> 46:16.925
that they are open.

46:16.965 --> 46:22.085
I wanna to see how

46:16.965 --> 46:22.085
other customers take to

46:16.965 --> 46:22.085
this concept at lunch.

46:22.125 --> 46:24.365
-[Liz] Ah, hello, again!

46:22.125 --> 46:24.365
-Fancy seeing you here.

46:24.405 --> 46:26.845
-Are you okay? All right.

46:24.405 --> 46:26.845
-How you doing?

46:26.885 --> 46:29.725
<i>So as an investment</i>

46:26.885 --> 46:29.725
<i>I always look for one word,</i>

46:29.765 --> 46:31.525
and that is the consistency.

46:31.565 --> 46:34.925
<i>The first plate of food</i>

46:31.565 --> 46:34.925
<i>should look exactly the same</i>

46:34.965 --> 46:37.365
<i>as the last plate of the food</i>

46:34.965 --> 46:37.365
<i>that comes out the kitchen.</i>

46:37.405 --> 46:42.245
That's the critical key

46:37.405 --> 46:42.245
to grow the brand to ten

46:37.405 --> 46:42.245
or 12 restaurants.

46:43.165 --> 46:44.405
Hello, Liz, how are you?

46:44.445 --> 46:45.565
[Liz] I'm all right.

46:45.605 --> 46:47.565
What's a nice light

46:45.605 --> 46:47.565
dish for lunch?

46:47.605 --> 46:51.085
Light. I would go for...

46:51.125 --> 46:52.565
Go for the Baba Bowl.

46:52.605 --> 46:53.765
The Baba Bowl. Okay.

46:53.805 --> 46:55.805
Looking at a four-minute

46:53.805 --> 46:55.805
turnout for the order,

46:55.845 --> 46:57.645
so it's going quite well.

46:57.685 --> 46:59.525
I've been recommended

46:57.685 --> 46:59.525
the Baba Bowl

46:59.565 --> 47:00.965
but I'm not gonna

46:59.565 --> 47:00.965
go for that.

47:01.005 --> 47:04.165
I'm gonna go for

47:01.005 --> 47:04.165
the chicken naanwich.

47:04.205 --> 47:05.925
Next order.

47:05.965 --> 47:07.325
Another naanwich.

47:07.365 --> 47:09.245
[Fred]

47:07.365 --> 47:09.245
<i>They've placed their orders.</i>

47:09.285 --> 47:13.645
<i>Now Atul and Jamie</i>

47:09.285 --> 47:13.645
<i>are conducting important</i>

47:09.285 --> 47:13.645
<i>firsthand customer research.</i>

47:13.685 --> 47:15.965
-[Atul] How is the lunch?

47:13.685 --> 47:15.965
-Best burger I've ever had.

47:16.005 --> 47:17.485
-Oh, really? Wow.

47:16.005 --> 47:17.485
-Easy.

47:17.525 --> 47:19.365
The bhaji on the top,

47:17.525 --> 47:19.365
the texture...

47:19.405 --> 47:20.765
-Yeah.

47:19.405 --> 47:20.765
-Very good.

47:20.805 --> 47:21.965
-You quite like that?

47:20.805 --> 47:21.965
-Yeah.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.445
[Jamie] Did it feel

47:22.005 --> 47:24.445
an easy choice for lunch?

47:24.485 --> 47:25.805
Lunch, yeah,

47:24.485 --> 47:25.805
it was perfect.

47:25.845 --> 47:27.285
Obviously, I've had

47:25.845 --> 47:27.285
burgers before,

47:27.325 --> 47:29.005
but this is really unusual.

47:29.045 --> 47:32.685
It is. That sort of Korean

47:29.045 --> 47:32.685
chili kick is great.

47:32.725 --> 47:36.605
I'm a vegetarian, and there's

47:32.725 --> 47:36.605
definitely loads that I would

47:32.725 --> 47:36.605
pick here again and again,

47:36.645 --> 47:38.965
so I think

47:36.645 --> 47:38.965
it's a really good idea.

47:39.005 --> 47:41.445
And would you come back

47:39.005 --> 47:41.445
for lunch here?

47:41.485 --> 47:43.605
I would absolutely come back.

47:43.645 --> 47:47.045
The food was delicious,

47:43.645 --> 47:47.045
the portions were great,

47:47.085 --> 47:48.805
but quite heavy for a lunch.

47:49.285 --> 47:51.045
Thank you.

47:51.085 --> 47:54.685
[Fred]<i> Jamie's had</i>

47:51.085 --> 47:54.685
<i>mostly good reviews</i>

47:51.085 --> 47:54.685
<i>for Baba G's as a lunch option.</i>

47:54.725 --> 47:58.685
<i>And Atul is about</i>

47:54.725 --> 47:58.685
<i>to put Baba G's consistency</i>

47:54.725 --> 47:58.685
<i>to the test.</i>

47:59.205 --> 48:00.645
[Atul] Fabulous.

48:19.925 --> 48:22.485
How are you, Atul?

48:19.925 --> 48:22.485
Are you enjoying your meal?

48:22.525 --> 48:24.125
Food is actually

48:22.525 --> 48:24.125
as good as yesterday.

48:25.085 --> 48:26.885
The quality is the same.

48:26.925 --> 48:29.285
There are some

48:26.925 --> 48:29.285
basic tweaks needed.

48:29.325 --> 48:32.565
I still have to think through

48:29.325 --> 48:32.565
whether I'm going to put my

48:29.325 --> 48:32.565
hand in the pocket or not.

48:32.605 --> 48:34.805
Well, look, I'm going

48:32.605 --> 48:34.805
to give you a deadline.

48:34.845 --> 48:38.885
You have until seven o'clock

48:34.845 --> 48:38.885
tonight to come back

48:34.845 --> 48:38.885
and make them an offer.

48:38.925 --> 48:40.525
-Good luck. See you later.

48:38.925 --> 48:40.525
-Thank you.

48:40.565 --> 48:42.605
See you later, Fred.

48:42.645 --> 48:44.365
[Fred]

48:42.645 --> 48:44.365
<i>He's talked to customers.</i>

48:44.405 --> 48:47.805
<i>Now Jamie's testing Baba G's</i>

48:44.405 --> 48:47.805
<i>as a lunch option himself.</i>

48:50.565 --> 48:52.925
It's a chicken tikka naanwich.

48:53.885 --> 48:55.645
It's all kind of falling apart,

48:55.685 --> 48:57.845
chips are quite cold.

48:57.885 --> 49:01.605
It's not as well-executed

48:57.885 --> 49:01.605
as yesterday.

49:04.365 --> 49:05.805
[Liz] Can I join you?

49:05.845 --> 49:08.485
-Liz.

49:05.845 --> 49:08.485
-How are you feeling

49:05.845 --> 49:08.485
second time round?

49:08.525 --> 49:10.085
Well, to be totally honest,

49:10.125 --> 49:12.365
the experience today

49:10.125 --> 49:12.365
wasn't as good as yesterday.

49:12.405 --> 49:14.125
Right.

49:14.165 --> 49:18.365
I ordered a naanwich

49:14.165 --> 49:18.365
and the naan was quite cold

49:14.165 --> 49:18.365
and dry and crumbly.

49:18.405 --> 49:20.245
And it was

49:18.405 --> 49:20.245
sort of falling apart.

49:20.285 --> 49:22.725
The chips were quite cold

49:20.285 --> 49:22.725
and a bit congealed

49:22.765 --> 49:24.605
like they'd been sitting out

49:22.765 --> 49:24.605
on the pass for a while.

49:24.645 --> 49:26.285
-So, it was--

49:24.645 --> 49:26.285
-That doesn't sound good.

49:26.325 --> 49:28.685
I would have expected that

49:28.725 --> 49:33.045
the poorer execution

49:28.725 --> 49:33.045
would have happened

49:28.725 --> 49:33.045
when you were slammed

49:33.085 --> 49:36.725
with 170 covers.

49:33.085 --> 49:36.725
So I'm not quite sure

49:33.085 --> 49:36.725
why it wasn't perfect.

49:39.045 --> 49:41.205
Spoke to Jamie.

49:41.245 --> 49:44.805
It seems that his food

49:41.245 --> 49:44.805
wasn't really on point today.

49:44.845 --> 49:46.565
His naan bread

49:44.845 --> 49:46.565
was crumbly and dry,

49:46.605 --> 49:49.405
his chicken was cold,

49:46.605 --> 49:49.405
his fries were cold.

49:49.445 --> 49:51.405
-Jamie. How's your lunch?

49:49.445 --> 49:51.405
-Fred.

49:52.645 --> 49:55.045
Um, my lunch is okay.

49:55.085 --> 49:57.245
Oh, but loved it yesterday?

49:57.285 --> 49:59.485
[Liz] It feels like

49:57.285 --> 49:59.485
he's backing out.

49:59.525 --> 50:01.365
It feels like

49:59.525 --> 50:01.365
he's backing out?

49:59.525 --> 50:01.365
Is that what he said?

50:01.405 --> 50:05.845
This service hasn't

50:01.405 --> 50:05.845
propelled us further

50:01.405 --> 50:05.845
and in fact...

50:07.645 --> 50:09.285
-It's set us back.

50:09.325 --> 50:12.245
And that's a really

50:09.325 --> 50:12.245
disappointing feeling

50:09.325 --> 50:12.245
right at this minute.

50:14.125 --> 50:16.885
Are you still

50:14.125 --> 50:16.885
considering in investing?

50:16.925 --> 50:20.725
I'm still considering,

50:16.925 --> 50:20.725
uh, investing,

50:20.765 --> 50:24.525
but I have a feeling

50:20.765 --> 50:24.525
this whole project is going

50:20.765 --> 50:24.525
to take more time and effort

50:24.565 --> 50:26.325
than I had

50:24.565 --> 50:26.325
originally anticipated.

50:26.365 --> 50:28.725
One of the investors

50:26.365 --> 50:28.725
said he had a really bad meal.

50:28.765 --> 50:30.645
I don't know what happened

50:28.765 --> 50:30.645
but whatever,

50:31.085 --> 50:32.565
not great.

50:33.805 --> 50:35.245
They've done

50:33.805 --> 50:35.245
all the hard work here,

50:35.285 --> 50:37.125
now the pressure is on you.

50:37.165 --> 50:39.445
You've got to decide

50:37.165 --> 50:39.445
whether you're going to make

50:37.165 --> 50:39.445
an offer later on tonight.

50:39.485 --> 50:40.925
-Yes.

50:39.485 --> 50:40.925
-You've gotta think.

50:40.965 --> 50:42.245
I'm gonna think.

50:42.285 --> 50:43.685
I leave you to it, Jamie.

50:42.285 --> 50:43.685
Good luck.

50:43.725 --> 50:44.885
See you later.

50:47.925 --> 50:50.925
I'm in the same situation

50:47.925 --> 50:50.925
that I was this morning

50:47.925 --> 50:50.925
which is,

50:52.405 --> 50:53.685
these guys are great.

50:53.725 --> 50:55.925
<i>I think the concept</i>

50:53.725 --> 50:55.925
<i>is really good,</i>

50:55.965 --> 50:58.765
I think it needs

50:55.965 --> 50:58.765
a lot of refinement,

50:55.965 --> 50:58.765
the menu needs broadening

50:58.805 --> 51:01.525
for lunch,

50:58.805 --> 51:01.525
all can be resolved.

51:01.565 --> 51:03.285
But fundamentally,

51:03.325 --> 51:07.605
I'm not used to being

51:03.325 --> 51:07.605
asked to make

51:03.325 --> 51:07.605
any kind of investment

51:07.645 --> 51:11.365
without a business plan

51:07.645 --> 51:11.365
and a very, very

51:07.645 --> 51:11.365
clear proposition

51:11.405 --> 51:14.725
of what they're going

51:11.405 --> 51:14.725
to do with the money and when

51:11.405 --> 51:14.725
we're going to get it back.

51:14.765 --> 51:16.685
I've got nothing to trust

51:14.765 --> 51:16.685
except for my gut instinct.

51:17.405 --> 51:19.205
[Liz] I feel fallen.

51:19.245 --> 51:22.085
-Deflated?

51:19.245 --> 51:22.085
-Deflated after

51:19.245 --> 51:22.085
so much hard work.

51:24.245 --> 51:25.485
Thank you again, guys.

51:25.525 --> 51:27.325
-Thank you for coming.

51:25.525 --> 51:27.325
-It was good fun.

51:27.365 --> 51:30.205
So, hopefully,

51:27.365 --> 51:30.205
I will see you soon.

51:30.245 --> 51:31.805
-Thanks a lot.

51:30.245 --> 51:31.805
-Thanks, Jamie.

51:31.845 --> 51:33.365
Bye, thank you.

51:35.885 --> 51:38.365
Feeling like all of it's...

51:38.405 --> 51:41.125
We've kind of almost had it

51:38.405 --> 51:41.125
and now we've lost it.

51:43.045 --> 51:45.485
Alec, thank you buddy.

51:43.045 --> 51:45.485
Good luck.

51:45.525 --> 51:46.525
Thank you.

51:46.565 --> 51:48.165
-Liz, thanks a lot.

51:46.565 --> 51:48.165
-Thank you.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.005
See you again.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.005
Thanks for the meal.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.005
Thank you.

51:52.005 --> 51:53.645
[Alec] I don't know

51:52.005 --> 51:53.645
if either of them

51:52.005 --> 51:53.645
are coming back.

51:53.685 --> 51:55.725
I don't know if any of them

51:53.685 --> 51:55.725
are coming back. Who knows?

51:56.605 --> 51:58.325
I'm not saying no to it.

51:58.365 --> 52:03.645
However, I'm mindful that

51:58.365 --> 52:03.645
I'm a little limited

51:58.365 --> 52:03.645
in my information,

52:03.685 --> 52:07.405
so I have to go a lot

52:03.685 --> 52:07.405
with my gut feeling

52:07.445 --> 52:10.485
whether I feel right

52:07.445 --> 52:10.485
to go and take this

52:07.445 --> 52:10.485
punt or not.

52:10.525 --> 52:13.765
Thank you all so much.

52:10.525 --> 52:13.765
Thank you for coming

52:10.525 --> 52:13.765
all the way from London

52:13.805 --> 52:15.845
and thank you guys

52:13.805 --> 52:15.845
for joining us.

52:15.885 --> 52:17.285
[all clapping]

52:18.245 --> 52:21.325
I think that

52:18.245 --> 52:21.325
we've lost Jamie

52:21.365 --> 52:24.125
-and that--

52:21.365 --> 52:24.125
-The balance is on...

52:24.165 --> 52:25.805
-It's whether Atul--

52:24.165 --> 52:25.805
-The jury's out with Atul.

52:25.845 --> 52:27.205
-So we'll see.

52:25.845 --> 52:27.205
-We'll see.

52:36.005 --> 52:37.485
[Fred]<i> Lunch is over.</i>

52:37.525 --> 52:41.165
<i>Now all Liz and Alec</i>

52:37.525 --> 52:41.165
<i>can do is wait.</i>

52:41.205 --> 52:44.885
<i>They came here looking</i>

52:41.205 --> 52:44.885
<i>for Â£300,000.</i>

52:44.925 --> 52:46.565
<i>The pressure is on</i>

52:44.925 --> 52:46.565
<i>the investors now.</i>

52:46.605 --> 52:48.565
They have to make a decision.

52:48.605 --> 52:51.925
They've got until

52:48.605 --> 52:51.925
seven o'clock to come back

52:48.605 --> 52:51.925
and make you an offer.

52:54.325 --> 52:56.605
<i>If more than</i>

52:54.325 --> 52:56.605
<i>one investor returns,</i>

52:56.645 --> 52:59.605
<i>Liz and Alec will have to</i>

52:56.645 --> 52:59.605
<i>choose between offers.</i>

53:00.965 --> 53:03.285
<i>But if no one comes in,</i>

53:03.325 --> 53:05.005
<i>they'll be back</i>

53:03.325 --> 53:05.005
<i>to their market stalls.</i>

53:05.525 --> 53:06.805
How do you feel?

53:06.845 --> 53:09.605
Kind of goes ups and downs

53:06.845 --> 53:09.605
from really nervous to...

53:09.645 --> 53:11.085
it will be what it will be.

53:19.205 --> 53:20.445
[sighs]

53:21.965 --> 53:23.245
What's going through your mind?

53:26.005 --> 53:28.565
You know, either way,

53:28.605 --> 53:31.445
it's been a great

53:28.605 --> 53:31.445
experience, you know.

53:31.485 --> 53:33.725
Either way

53:31.485 --> 53:33.725
Baba G's will continue.

53:52.965 --> 53:53.925
Oh.

53:55.125 --> 53:56.245
Hello.

53:57.405 --> 53:59.445
-Fancy seeing you here.

53:57.405 --> 53:59.445
-[all laughing]

54:00.925 --> 54:02.605
-[Liz] Oh, my God.

54:00.925 --> 54:02.605
-How you doing?

54:02.645 --> 54:04.085
-Jamie.

54:02.645 --> 54:04.085
-Hello!

54:04.125 --> 54:05.485
-Hello, there.

54:04.125 --> 54:05.485
-How are you?

54:06.565 --> 54:08.365
Hi, how are you?

54:08.405 --> 54:10.325
-You okay?

54:08.405 --> 54:10.325
Exhausting day?

54:08.405 --> 54:10.325
-Yeah.

54:10.365 --> 54:12.565
-Couple of days?

54:10.365 --> 54:12.565
-[Alec] Exhausted!

54:12.605 --> 54:14.005
[Jamie]

54:12.605 --> 54:14.005
Well, lovely to see you.

54:14.045 --> 54:15.565
Lovely to see you.

54:15.605 --> 54:17.165
Before you carry on

54:15.605 --> 54:17.165
the conversation,

54:15.605 --> 54:17.165
can I just say, Jamie,

54:17.205 --> 54:19.845
I'm so sorry but you know

54:17.205 --> 54:19.845
we've got a deadline

54:17.205 --> 54:19.845
of seven o'clock.

54:19.885 --> 54:22.845
We wanna give

54:19.885 --> 54:22.845
a chance to Atul

54:19.885 --> 54:22.845
to turn up on time.

54:29.805 --> 54:31.405
-I'm still nervous.

54:29.805 --> 54:31.405
-Still nervous.

54:51.285 --> 54:53.485
-Oh!

54:51.285 --> 54:53.485
-[Atul] Hello!

54:53.525 --> 54:55.005
-[Alec] Wow.

54:53.525 --> 54:55.005
-Hello, guys.

54:55.045 --> 54:56.525
-How are you?

54:55.045 --> 54:56.525
-[Alec] Hi!

54:58.645 --> 55:00.765
[Atul] Oh, somebody's

54:58.645 --> 55:00.765
not happy to see me.

55:00.805 --> 55:02.005
[all laughing]

55:02.045 --> 55:04.085
-How are you?

55:02.045 --> 55:04.085
-Very well, thank you.

55:04.125 --> 55:05.845
-How are you, Liz?

55:04.125 --> 55:05.845
-Yes.

55:05.885 --> 55:07.165
-Good to see you, sir.

55:05.885 --> 55:07.165
-And you, too.

55:07.205 --> 55:10.565
-Here we go.

55:07.205 --> 55:10.565
-[Fred] Please can you

55:07.205 --> 55:10.565
take a seat?

55:10.605 --> 55:13.805
Jamie came in first,

55:10.605 --> 55:13.805
so I think it's fair that we

55:10.605 --> 55:13.805
hear from you first, Jamie.

55:13.845 --> 55:16.485
What is your offer

55:13.845 --> 55:16.485
and what is your vision

55:13.845 --> 55:16.485
for Baba G's?

55:18.845 --> 55:21.165
If we manage to identify

55:18.845 --> 55:21.165
the right restaurant for you,

55:21.205 --> 55:23.045
a fully fitted-out restaurant,

55:23.085 --> 55:26.045
and we both agree that

55:23.085 --> 55:26.045
it's the right opportunity,

55:26.085 --> 55:28.205
and we believe

55:26.085 --> 55:28.205
in the business plan,

55:28.245 --> 55:32.125
then my offer

55:28.245 --> 55:32.125
is an investment

55:28.245 --> 55:32.125
of Â£200,000

55:33.045 --> 55:34.885
to take that forward.

55:34.925 --> 55:36.885
-Thank you.

55:34.925 --> 55:36.885
-Thank you so much.

55:38.565 --> 55:40.805
Atul, your turn now.

55:40.845 --> 55:42.285
[Atul] Right, guys.

55:42.325 --> 55:44.805
Your product is good.

55:42.325 --> 55:44.805
You both are good.

55:44.845 --> 55:46.805
I do believe that

55:44.845 --> 55:46.805
this concept has got legs.

55:46.845 --> 55:50.085
Maybe we can make

55:46.845 --> 55:50.085
this concept go really big.

55:50.565 --> 55:51.965
Based on that,

55:52.005 --> 55:54.845
I would like to offer you

55:52.005 --> 55:54.845
an investment of...

55:56.445 --> 55:58.165
Â£300,000.

55:58.205 --> 56:01.645
If 300,000 can fund

55:58.205 --> 56:01.645
two restaurants,

55:58.205 --> 56:01.645
I would love that.

56:02.445 --> 56:03.645
Wow.

56:04.685 --> 56:06.885
Thank you both

56:04.685 --> 56:06.885
very much for your offer.

56:06.925 --> 56:10.365
You need to take

56:06.925 --> 56:10.365
a moment together

56:06.925 --> 56:10.365
and discuss

56:10.405 --> 56:13.885
which of the offer

56:10.405 --> 56:13.885
you think is the best

56:10.405 --> 56:13.885
and the most suited to you.

56:13.925 --> 56:15.205
-[Liz] Okay.

56:13.925 --> 56:15.205
-[Alec] Thank you.

56:18.725 --> 56:20.285
[Alec]

56:18.725 --> 56:20.285
The kudos from Atul...

56:20.325 --> 56:23.245
[Liz] And his understanding

56:20.325 --> 56:23.245
of the food and, imagine,

56:23.285 --> 56:28.085
Atul Kochhar helping develop

56:23.285 --> 56:28.085
our Baba G's range.

56:28.125 --> 56:30.205
-I am torn because

56:28.125 --> 56:30.205
-But...

56:30.245 --> 56:32.445
it just keeps weighing

56:30.245 --> 56:32.445
in my head about the fact

56:32.485 --> 56:36.005
that Jamie has so much

56:32.485 --> 56:36.005
knowledge literally

56:32.485 --> 56:36.005
in our industry.

56:44.925 --> 56:46.725
Right, the tables

56:44.925 --> 56:46.725
are turned now.

56:47.365 --> 56:48.805
What's your decision?

56:48.845 --> 56:50.525
We've really thought

56:48.845 --> 56:50.525
hard about this.

56:50.565 --> 56:53.165
Um, we're gonna...

56:55.005 --> 56:55.925
We're gonna go with Atul.

56:57.285 --> 56:58.245
Whoo-hoo!

56:59.165 --> 57:00.685
Congratulations.

57:00.725 --> 57:02.685
Well done. Wise choice.

57:04.765 --> 57:06.965
Thank you.

57:07.005 --> 57:11.285
Did Baba G's

57:07.005 --> 57:11.285
choose the right man?

57:07.005 --> 57:11.285
I think yes, absolutely.

57:11.325 --> 57:15.165
<i>The moment I saw</i>

57:11.325 --> 57:15.165
<i>this product in London,</i>

57:11.325 --> 57:15.165
<i>I thought, "It's me."</i>

57:15.205 --> 57:19.325
They are a great team,

57:15.205 --> 57:19.325
and they need some direction,

57:15.205 --> 57:19.325
they need some tweaking.

57:19.365 --> 57:21.645
<i>In a lot of ways</i>

57:19.365 --> 57:21.645
<i>I see my story within them.</i>

57:21.685 --> 57:23.325
I can't wait to get cracking.

57:23.365 --> 57:25.925
[all] To Baba G's.

57:25.965 --> 57:28.605
Good on them. I think

57:25.965 --> 57:28.605
they're an Indian concept

57:28.645 --> 57:30.765
and they have the opportunity

57:28.645 --> 57:30.765
to work with

57:30.805 --> 57:33.005
one of the greatest

57:30.805 --> 57:33.005
Indian chefs in the country,

57:33.045 --> 57:34.885
so hats off to them.

57:34.925 --> 57:36.525
They're gonna do well,

57:34.925 --> 57:36.525
whatever happens.

57:36.565 --> 57:38.085
I'm pleased it worked out.

57:38.125 --> 57:39.645
Cheers!

57:39.685 --> 57:41.165
[Alec]<i> It's nice how</i>

57:39.685 --> 57:41.165
<i>the tables have turned.</i>

57:41.205 --> 57:43.285
I've never really had

57:41.205 --> 57:43.285
to reject an investor before,

57:43.325 --> 57:44.685
that was a bit weird.

57:44.725 --> 57:46.845
I hate rejecting people.

57:46.885 --> 57:49.045
That's how I got in there.

57:49.085 --> 57:50.485
[both laughing]

57:52.845 --> 57:56.445
I'd really like to thank you

57:52.845 --> 57:56.445
for playing a part

57:52.845 --> 57:56.445
in the experience.

57:56.485 --> 57:58.125
Because we got it!

57:58.165 --> 57:59.485
[all yelling]

58:02.525 --> 58:05.965
[Alec]<i> This is the start</i>

58:02.525 --> 58:05.965
<i>of a whole new chapter</i>

58:02.525 --> 58:05.965
<i>in Baba G's.</i>

58:06.005 --> 58:09.125
Relationships go through

58:06.005 --> 58:09.125
up and down and as

58:06.005 --> 58:09.125
the business goes down,

58:09.165 --> 58:11.485
generally the relationship

58:09.165 --> 58:11.485
goes down and as

58:09.165 --> 58:11.485
the business goes up,

58:11.525 --> 58:12.885
your relationship goes up.

58:12.925 --> 58:14.525
And right now

58:12.925 --> 58:14.525
we're really on an up.

58:14.565 --> 58:16.805
I might even

58:14.565 --> 58:16.805
get some nooky tonight,

58:14.565 --> 58:16.805
you never know.

58:16.845 --> 58:17.965
[laughing]

58:20.645 --> 58:23.405
Wow, 300 grand!

58:23.445 --> 58:25.285
Whoa, that was

58:23.445 --> 58:25.285
a roller-coaster.

58:25.325 --> 58:28.365
I mean, clearly,

58:25.325 --> 58:28.365
there's something

58:25.325 --> 58:28.365
so special about Baba G's.

58:28.405 --> 58:31.805
And now that Alec and Liz

58:28.405 --> 58:31.805
have their investment,

58:28.405 --> 58:31.805
it's their time,

58:31.845 --> 58:33.365
and I wish them

58:31.845 --> 58:33.365
the best of luck.

58:37.365 --> 58:41.125
I'm having a bit of

58:37.365 --> 58:41.125
a nightmare right now.

58:37.365 --> 58:41.125
Starting to shake.

58:41.165 --> 58:42.725
[man 1] I'm really hoping

58:41.165 --> 58:42.725
they say nice things,

58:42.765 --> 58:44.925
'cause I've got

58:42.765 --> 58:44.925
quite a fragile ego.

58:44.965 --> 58:46.245
What is this, please?

58:46.285 --> 58:48.325
[man 2]

58:46.285 --> 58:48.325
This is the Halen Leek,

58:48.365 --> 58:50.125
and it's served

58:48.365 --> 58:50.125
with edible dirt.

58:51.205 --> 58:53.125
Is he crazy, is he a genius?

58:53.165 --> 58:54.485
I have absolutely no idea.
