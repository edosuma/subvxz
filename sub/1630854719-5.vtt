WEBVTT

01:17.866 --> 01:20.410
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

01:29.252 --> 01:32.255
Fuck you, FEDRA!
Fuck you, FEDRA!

02:01.409 --> 02:04.120
<i>Kansas City belongs to the people.</i>

02:04.120 --> 02:08.875
<i>Collaborators, surrender now,
and you will receive a fair trial.</i>

02:09.667 --> 02:13.087
<i>We have control of the QZ
and the open city.</i>

02:13.087 --> 02:17.884
<i>Anyone caught hiding will face charges
of counter-revolutionary activities.</i>

02:17.884 --> 02:20.511
<i>Kansas City belongs to the people.</i>

02:21.638 --> 02:23.806
<i>Collaborators, surrender now...</i>

03:10.937 --> 03:14.482
You know, Perry,
I used to be so scared of these people.

03:15.525 --> 03:17.068
Now look at them.

03:18.653 --> 03:20.196
Did it feel good,

03:20.947 --> 03:23.282
betraying your neighbors to FEDRA?

03:23.783 --> 03:26.369
Watching us get thrown in prison,

03:26.369 --> 03:27.996
watching us hang,

03:27.996 --> 03:30.248
so that you could get medicine,

03:30.248 --> 03:33.876
alcohol, fucking apples?

03:37.422 --> 03:39.340
Did it make you feel better?

03:40.425 --> 03:42.343
Did it make you feel safe?

03:45.221 --> 03:47.140
How does it make you feel now?

03:51.644 --> 03:53.438
Well, I'm not FEDRA.

03:53.438 --> 03:55.398
Lucky for you

03:55.398 --> 03:57.316
no one here has to die.

03:58.568 --> 04:00.653
Yeah, we could put you on trial.

04:00.653 --> 04:02.947
You're all guilty,
so that's how that'll go.

04:02.947 --> 04:05.074
And you'll do some time. Easy.

04:05.074 --> 04:08.703
But first, you have
to do something for me.

04:11.289 --> 04:12.832
Where is Henry?

04:14.792 --> 04:16.544
You're informers.

04:17.462 --> 04:18.838
Inform.

04:19.297 --> 04:22.050
Where is Henry?

04:27.096 --> 04:28.848
I guess they don't know.

04:33.061 --> 04:35.563
- Kill them.
- He's with Edelstein.

04:39.776 --> 04:42.111
Edelstein was a collaborator?

04:43.780 --> 04:46.908
Well, he was a lot more discreet
than you fucking idiots.

04:47.575 --> 04:48.910
Where are they?

04:50.161 --> 04:52.872
He said he was meeting up
with Henry and Sam.

04:53.247 --> 04:54.123
'Kay.

04:54.123 --> 04:57.251
He had a place to hole up in the open city

04:57.251 --> 04:59.253
in case things went bad.

05:00.755 --> 05:04.092
But things have gone great,
haven't you heard?

05:04.801 --> 05:07.053
Kansas City is free.

05:09.263 --> 05:10.973
Hole up where?

05:11.599 --> 05:13.017
He didn't say.

05:14.519 --> 05:18.064
I swear, I've told you everything I know.

05:19.607 --> 05:21.150
Of course, you have.

05:22.318 --> 05:23.653
You're a rat.

05:26.697 --> 05:27.865
He's still in the city.

05:27.865 --> 05:31.911
Okay, I want our people going door-to-door
until we find him.

05:31.911 --> 05:33.663
- Now?
- I'm sorry.

05:33.663 --> 05:35.498
How long do you think we should wait?

05:35.498 --> 05:37.917
Should we wait a day or two?
Should we wait a week?

05:37.917 --> 05:40.086
Fuck it. Let's give him a month.

05:40.086 --> 05:42.213
I'm not sayin' we do nothin'.

05:42.213 --> 05:43.798
We already got a perimeter
around the city.

05:43.798 --> 05:45.758
We can wait him
out. Door-to-door would take a lotta men,

05:45.758 --> 05:46.843
and there are other things that
probably need--

05:46.843 --> 05:50.304
He's not my seventh priority, Perry.

05:50.304 --> 05:51.722
Is that what he is to you?

05:55.101 --> 05:55.893
No.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.399
Are we really puttin' 'em on trial?

06:02.650 --> 06:06.445
No, we are not really
putting them on trial.

06:06.445 --> 06:09.448
When you're done, burn the bodies.
It's faster.

07:22.563 --> 07:24.315
You sure they don't know about this?

07:25.107 --> 07:28.236
I got it from a FEDRA officer.

07:30.321 --> 07:31.447
Patient.

07:32.031 --> 07:33.449
Owed me a favor.

07:33.449 --> 07:37.703
He said he found it himself,
never told anyone about it.

07:37.703 --> 07:39.789
- And what if they get to him?
- They already did.

07:39.789 --> 07:41.791
- He won't be talking.
- Fuck.

07:41.791 --> 07:44.210
Okay. Water? Toilets?

07:46.045 --> 07:49.090
The apartments below
are tied into the QZ main.

07:49.090 --> 07:52.718
We can use those,
but we have to be fast and careful.

07:52.718 --> 07:54.720
- Food?
- Whatever you brought.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.472
I barely made it out as is.

07:56.472 --> 07:57.807
So we're fucked on food?

07:57.807 --> 07:59.642
- Ammunition?
- Empty.

07:59.642 --> 08:01.060
Yeah, so is mine.

08:02.144 --> 08:04.272
We weren't shooting our way
outta this anyway.

08:04.647 --> 08:06.983
No, so we'll sneak our way out.

08:08.442 --> 08:09.402
How?

08:09.735 --> 08:12.154
- Tunnels.
- Tunnels?

08:12.154 --> 08:13.572
Why go to the trouble?

08:13.572 --> 08:15.116
You can kill yourself right here.

08:16.325 --> 08:19.078
Twenty cans, and six pounds of jerky
for the three of us.

08:19.954 --> 08:21.122
If we stick to the minimum,

08:21.122 --> 08:22.915
I think we can make it 11 days?

08:23.833 --> 08:25.751
So that's how long we have
to figure it out.

08:26.961 --> 08:28.087
Is he scared?

08:29.880 --> 08:32.341
Yeah. Well, he saw a lot.

08:32.341 --> 08:34.343
Nothin' I can do about that now.

08:36.554 --> 08:39.307
He's scared because you're scared.

10:58.529 --> 10:59.613
What?

11:14.962 --> 11:16.881
Yeah, yeah.

16:21.602 --> 16:22.728
Joel.

16:24.062 --> 16:25.397
Joel!

16:28.817 --> 16:30.569
Eyes on me. Eyes on me.

16:32.404 --> 16:34.323
You don't have to worry about what to say.

16:35.199 --> 16:36.784
We don't wanna hurt you.

16:36.784 --> 16:38.368
We wanna help you.

16:39.953 --> 16:40.871
Okay.

16:42.539 --> 16:43.457
Okay,

16:45.375 --> 16:47.628
I don't know what the next step is
with something like this,

16:47.628 --> 16:49.338
but if I lower my gun,

16:49.338 --> 16:50.506
we didn't hurt you,

16:51.131 --> 16:52.800
so you don't hurt us,

16:52.800 --> 16:53.801
right?

16:55.511 --> 16:56.845
That's right.

16:58.013 --> 16:59.181
That's a weird fuckin' tone, man.

16:59.181 --> 17:01.141
That's just the way he sounds.
He has an asshole voice.

17:01.141 --> 17:02.559
Joel, tell him he's okay.

17:04.436 --> 17:06.313
- Everything is great.
- Dude.

17:06.313 --> 17:07.314
Fuck!

17:08.190 --> 17:10.317
Okay. Listen,

17:11.193 --> 17:12.736
I'm gonna trust you.

17:21.161 --> 17:22.371
Yes.

17:22.371 --> 17:23.997
But if either of you guys try anything,

17:25.707 --> 17:26.500
yeah?

17:27.918 --> 17:28.710
Yeah?

17:29.128 --> 17:30.254
Yeah.

17:39.555 --> 17:40.556
Can I sit up?

17:42.099 --> 17:42.891
Yeah.

17:43.559 --> 17:44.518
Slow.

17:45.352 --> 17:46.687
Get up slow.

17:56.655 --> 17:57.781
Who are you?

18:01.285 --> 18:02.619
My name's Henry.

18:03.871 --> 18:05.205
That's my brother, Sam.

18:05.873 --> 18:08.458
I'm the most wanted man in Kansas City.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.793
Although right now

18:12.880 --> 18:15.007
my guess is you're running a close second.

18:27.561 --> 18:29.479
- Where'd you get these?
- From Bill.

18:30.689 --> 18:32.024
He's dead.

18:50.459 --> 18:52.169
He says thank you.

18:52.169 --> 18:55.631
I'm guessing you don't have much,
so, this means a lot.

18:57.174 --> 18:58.508
How old is he?

19:03.263 --> 19:05.390
- He's eight.
- Cool.

19:06.099 --> 19:07.225
I'm Ellie.

19:19.529 --> 19:22.449
I'm Joel. Look, you ate,
we didn't kill each other,

19:22.449 --> 19:24.368
let's call this a win-win and move on.

19:26.912 --> 19:28.497
Well, I'm betting,

19:28.497 --> 19:29.998
that y'all came up here

19:29.998 --> 19:32.000
to get a view of the city
and plan a way out.

19:33.043 --> 19:34.586
And when the sun's up,

19:35.462 --> 19:36.797
I'll show you one.

19:40.842 --> 19:42.678
Welcome to Killa City.

19:42.678 --> 19:43.720
No FEDRA.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.138
Not as of 10 days ago, no.

19:45.555 --> 19:48.892
- We always heard KC FEDRA was--
- Monsters? Savages?

19:49.726 --> 19:51.269
Yeah, you heard right.

19:52.187 --> 19:54.439
Raped and tortured and murdered people
for 20 years.

19:54.982 --> 19:57.526
And you know what happens
when you do that to people?

19:57.526 --> 20:00.195
The moment they get a chance,
they do it right back to you.

20:00.195 --> 20:01.655
But you're not FEDRA.

20:04.074 --> 20:06.201
No, worse.

20:06.994 --> 20:08.537
I'm a collaborator.

20:10.455 --> 20:13.250
- I don't work with rats.
- Yeah, you fucking do.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.501
Today you do,

20:14.501 --> 20:17.004
'cause I live here and you don't.

20:17.004 --> 20:18.463
That's how I followed you here.

20:18.463 --> 20:21.466
I know this city, and that's how
I'm gonna help you get out.

20:23.218 --> 20:24.344
Why help us?

20:25.679 --> 20:27.639
I saw what you did,

20:27.639 --> 20:29.057
the way you killed those men.

20:29.766 --> 20:31.351
Now, I know where to go

20:31.351 --> 20:33.270
but I don't know how to make it
through alive.

20:33.270 --> 20:35.564
- Not if it's just me and Sam.
- You seem capable enough.

20:35.564 --> 20:37.566
- You're armed.
- You're wrong, and wrong.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.193
Never killed anyone.

20:40.944 --> 20:42.404
And pointing an unloaded gun at you

20:42.404 --> 20:44.614
was the closest I've ever come
to being violent.

20:46.825 --> 20:48.368
So that's the deal.

20:49.411 --> 20:50.537
I show the way,

20:51.455 --> 20:52.581
you clear the way.

21:05.552 --> 21:07.679
Haven't heard that in a long time.

21:09.347 --> 21:11.433
So how are we gettin' out?

21:22.527 --> 21:24.863
Highways, downtown.

21:25.447 --> 21:26.281
Us.

21:26.782 --> 21:28.950
This whole area belongs to Kathleen.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.243
She's in charge?

21:30.243 --> 21:31.870
Leader of the resistance.

21:32.704 --> 21:34.873
You can see the way
we're bounded by highways.

21:34.873 --> 21:37.250
They got people posted all around
the inside perimeter.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.336
If we get close, we get caught.

21:39.336 --> 21:40.587
No question.

21:40.587 --> 21:42.130
So how do we get across?

22:01.608 --> 22:02.609
Boom.

22:02.609 --> 22:04.277
Kansas City has a subway?

22:04.277 --> 22:06.571
No, but they do have maintenance tunnels.

22:06.571 --> 22:09.449
There's a bunch of buildings all put up
by the same developers.

22:09.449 --> 22:11.201
And they share these tunnels, including,

22:11.201 --> 22:12.577
a bank building here.

22:12.577 --> 22:14.287
So we enter the tunnels here,

22:14.287 --> 22:16.706
travel underground, and pop up here.

22:16.706 --> 22:18.834
Westside North. Residential.

22:18.834 --> 22:21.253
There's an embankment on the other side
of the houses.

22:21.253 --> 22:22.462
We head down,

22:22.462 --> 22:24.464
pedestrian bridge over the river,

22:26.007 --> 22:26.925
free as a bird.

22:27.342 --> 22:29.845
You're right. It's a great plan.

22:29.845 --> 22:31.221
So what do you need me for?

22:34.099 --> 22:37.477
You noticed anything
strange about this city?

22:37.477 --> 22:39.688
Other than the strange shit
you've already seen?

22:39.688 --> 22:43.191
- No Infected?
- There's Infected.

22:43.191 --> 22:44.860
Just not on the surface.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.611
FEDRA drove them underground 15 years ago,

22:46.611 --> 22:48.613
and never let them come back up.

22:48.613 --> 22:50.615
It's the only good thing
those fascist motherfuckers ever did.

22:50.615 --> 22:52.200
So you want us goin' into a tunnel?

22:52.200 --> 22:54.870
Everyone thinks
that it's full of Infected,

22:54.870 --> 22:57.038
including Kathleen,
which means that we're not gonna be

22:57.038 --> 22:58.623
running into any of her people.

22:58.999 --> 23:01.459
But you see, what I know is,

23:01.459 --> 23:02.752
it's empty.

23:02.752 --> 23:04.087
You've been down there?

23:05.213 --> 23:08.175
No, but the FEDRA guy that I worked with

23:08.175 --> 23:10.552
told me that it's clean, completely clean.

23:10.552 --> 23:12.512
- They cleared it out. All of it.
- When?

23:12.929 --> 23:14.931
Like, three years ago.

23:16.057 --> 23:18.185
Okay, maybe, there's one or two,

23:18.185 --> 23:20.353
- but you handle it.
- What if there's more?

23:20.353 --> 23:22.355
Or one of those blind ones
that sees like a bat?

23:22.355 --> 23:24.274
Wait, you ran into a Clicker?

23:24.274 --> 23:26.193
- Two of 'em.
- And you're still alive.

23:27.027 --> 23:27.944
You see?

23:29.029 --> 23:30.238
You're the right people.

23:30.238 --> 23:32.657
If it gets bad down there, we turn around,

23:32.657 --> 23:34.493
and run right back out
the same way we came.

23:34.493 --> 23:35.577
That's your great plan?

23:35.577 --> 23:37.746
No, that's my dicey-as-fuck plan.

23:38.413 --> 23:39.956
But as far as I can tell,

23:41.875 --> 23:43.210
it's our only shot.

23:50.175 --> 23:54.387
They're saying
they're going to help us escape.

23:58.391 --> 23:59.309
Right?

24:16.785 --> 24:18.286
We need to get outta sight.

24:20.372 --> 24:21.373
I think it's this way.

24:34.344 --> 24:35.679
This should be it.

24:36.930 --> 24:38.056
You ready?

24:39.266 --> 24:40.809
Get your gun out.

25:03.498 --> 25:05.458
You see? It's empty.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.294
The plan is good.

25:07.294 --> 25:08.878
"The plan is good"?

25:08.878 --> 25:10.297
We've been down here two seconds.

25:10.297 --> 25:11.506
We don't know anything.

25:12.757 --> 25:13.758
Your dad's kind of a pessimist.

25:13.758 --> 25:15.552
- He's not my dad.
- I'm not her dad.

25:15.552 --> 25:17.554
Just point your light forward,

25:18.221 --> 25:19.764
and be ready to run.

26:16.654 --> 26:17.572
No.

26:57.362 --> 26:59.364
I heard about places like this.

26:59.364 --> 27:01.866
People went underground
after Outbreak Day.

27:01.866 --> 27:03.284
Built settlements.

27:03.284 --> 27:04.661
What happened to them?

27:04.661 --> 27:08.373
Maybe they didn't follow the rules
and they all got infected.

27:29.686 --> 27:32.605
No way! I love these.

27:38.486 --> 27:41.072
I have issues

27:41.072 --> 27:44.242
four, five, six, 11.

27:55.170 --> 27:56.004
So cool.

28:00.175 --> 28:05.138
"To the edge of the universe,

28:05.138 --> 28:06.556
"and back.

28:06.973 --> 28:10.727
Endure and survive."

28:12.479 --> 28:13.605
Endure.

28:14.022 --> 28:15.148
Survive.

28:15.690 --> 28:17.859
Endure. Survive.

28:17.859 --> 28:20.320
Fuck yeah, man!

28:20.320 --> 28:22.906
- Hey, keep it down. We're not out yet.
- C'mon.

28:22.906 --> 28:24.532
Can we just rest here for a while?

28:24.532 --> 28:26.451
There's actually shit to do here.

28:26.451 --> 28:28.578
Wouldn't be so bad
to wait the light out a bit.

28:28.578 --> 28:31.039
Safer in shadows when we pop back out
on the other side.

28:44.469 --> 28:47.055
Yes! Come on! Yeah!

28:48.389 --> 28:49.474
Come on. Pass it back.

28:50.725 --> 28:52.185
Yeah!

28:53.436 --> 28:54.354
Okay.

28:58.691 --> 29:00.401
If you were

29:00.401 --> 29:02.904
collaboratin' to take care of him,

29:05.198 --> 29:07.408
I shouldn't have said what I said.

29:07.408 --> 29:09.410
I don't know your situation.

29:10.370 --> 29:11.746
And I'm not sayin'
they should let it go, but.

29:11.746 --> 29:13.289
That was awesome!

29:13.289 --> 29:15.750
All things considered,
seems kinda cruel--

29:15.750 --> 29:16.918
Yeah.

29:17.627 --> 29:20.046
to send a whole army after you for that.

29:20.046 --> 29:20.964
Yeah.

29:23.633 --> 29:26.177
- Yeah!
- You know, I wasn't

29:26.803 --> 29:29.931
exactly telling you the truth before

29:31.266 --> 29:33.184
about me not killing someone.

29:35.562 --> 29:37.480
There was a man, a great man.

29:38.982 --> 29:40.900
You know, he was never afraid,

29:41.442 --> 29:42.986
never selfish,

29:43.945 --> 29:45.863
and he was always forgiving.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.660
Have you ever met someone like that?

29:50.660 --> 29:52.662
Kinda man you'd follow anywhere.

29:54.330 --> 29:56.040
I mean, I wanted to.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.042
Well, I would've.

30:00.795 --> 30:02.046
Yeah, but

30:02.880 --> 30:04.424
Sam, he

30:05.425 --> 30:07.343
he got sick.

30:08.386 --> 30:09.721
Leukemia.

30:13.474 --> 30:15.435
Yeah, anyway,

30:16.019 --> 30:17.812
there was one drug that worked,

30:17.812 --> 30:21.608
and, whoa, big shock,

30:21.608 --> 30:23.318
there wasn't much left of it

30:23.318 --> 30:25.153
and it belonged to FEDRA.

30:25.737 --> 30:27.488
And if I wanted some,

30:27.488 --> 30:29.490
it was gonna take something big.

30:31.451 --> 30:33.369
So I gave them something big.

30:34.871 --> 30:36.372
That one great man.

30:38.875 --> 30:41.961
The leader of the resistance movement
in Kansas City.

30:45.506 --> 30:47.175
And Kathleen's brother.

30:49.886 --> 30:51.095
Yeah, so,

30:51.095 --> 30:53.097
you still think they
should take it easy on me?

30:54.057 --> 30:55.808
Or am I the bad guy?

30:57.644 --> 30:59.228
I don't know what you're waitin' on, man.

30:59.228 --> 31:01.022
The answer's easy.

31:01.022 --> 31:04.025
I am the bad guy
because I did a bad guy thing.

31:09.781 --> 31:11.366
But you get it, though.

31:11.366 --> 31:13.242
You might not be her father,

31:13.242 --> 31:14.869
but you were someone's.

31:15.787 --> 31:17.121
See, I could tell.

31:23.836 --> 31:25.880
Yeah, where'd he go?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.715
We've waited long enough.

31:57.078 --> 31:58.996
- And?
- We haven't found 'em yet.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.749
What about the man who killed Bryan?

32:02.750 --> 32:03.626
Well,

32:04.919 --> 32:06.838
we're not doin' so good.

32:10.341 --> 32:12.260
Who told you I was here?

32:12.760 --> 32:13.886
Your mom.

32:14.971 --> 32:16.973
Why are you talking to my mom?

32:18.808 --> 32:20.101
We didn't know where you were.

32:25.565 --> 32:28.151
Have you been back to the room
you grew up in?

32:28.151 --> 32:29.986
No. Fuck no.

32:30.695 --> 32:32.029
It's a couple hundred miles away.

32:32.029 --> 32:33.322
It's not exactly worth it.

32:33.823 --> 32:35.074
Right.

32:39.746 --> 32:41.664
When Michael and I were little,

32:42.707 --> 32:44.959
this room seemed so big.

32:47.295 --> 32:50.131
I was really scared of thunder

32:50.131 --> 32:52.133
so when there was a storm,

32:54.510 --> 32:58.264
Michael told me
that this wasn't a room at all.

32:59.056 --> 33:01.100
That this was actually

33:01.100 --> 33:03.394
just a big, wooden box.

33:04.103 --> 33:07.648
A big, wooden box
that nothing could get inside of.

33:08.733 --> 33:11.986
And it didn't matter
if there was lightning

33:11.986 --> 33:14.739
or tornadoes or gunfire.

33:18.451 --> 33:22.580
He said as long as we were together.

33:23.498 --> 33:26.042
in our perfect box,

33:26.959 --> 33:28.503
we would be safe.

33:32.340 --> 33:33.883
He did that for me.

33:34.717 --> 33:37.345
And he did stuff like that all the time.

33:39.847 --> 33:42.266
He was so beautiful.

33:49.106 --> 33:50.233
I'm not.

33:52.819 --> 33:54.070
I never was.

33:55.196 --> 33:58.783
He would be horrified
by the things I've done.

33:58.783 --> 34:00.993
And if you've come to tell me

34:02.161 --> 34:04.705
that Michael wouldn't
want me to hurt Henry

34:05.957 --> 34:08.084
that he would want me to forgive.

34:09.502 --> 34:11.254
I know that, too.

34:12.338 --> 34:13.548
He told me.

34:15.842 --> 34:19.595
The last time I saw him alive in jail

34:22.682 --> 34:24.600
he told me to forgive.

34:30.481 --> 34:33.401
And what did he get for that?

34:35.653 --> 34:38.030
Where is the justice in that?

34:38.030 --> 34:40.658
What is the point of that?

34:43.911 --> 34:47.456
Your brother was a great man.
We all loved him.

34:48.124 --> 34:49.041
But

34:49.792 --> 34:52.920
he didn't change anything.

34:55.006 --> 34:56.132
You did.

34:59.218 --> 35:00.970
We're with you.

35:08.811 --> 35:09.729
Good.

35:21.949 --> 35:24.285
- Do you know where we are?
- Yep.

35:25.119 --> 35:26.662
The other side.

35:49.143 --> 35:51.437
No. No one is here.

35:51.437 --> 35:55.441
No one's gonna be here because
my plan worked.

35:55.441 --> 35:57.652
So much goddamn talkin'.

35:57.652 --> 35:59.862
I'm just saying, I delivered.

36:00.363 --> 36:02.740
Make this right, go down the street,

36:02.740 --> 36:04.742
embankment behind the last house

36:05.826 --> 36:07.161
and we're out.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.956
So we cross the river and then what?

36:09.956 --> 36:12.250
- Where ya gonna go?
- Don't know yet.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.502
Well, we're goin' to Wyoming.

36:14.502 --> 36:15.836
What? It's a huge state.

36:15.836 --> 36:17.672
It can fit two more people.

36:18.965 --> 36:21.592
Yeah, maybe we just
call this one a success

36:21.592 --> 36:22.802
and say our fond farewells.

36:22.802 --> 36:24.553
No, he'll change his mind. Trust me.

36:24.553 --> 36:25.596
This is how it goes.

36:25.596 --> 36:29.725
He's like, "No, Ellie.
Never, ever, ever happening."

36:29.725 --> 36:33.562
And then I'm like, "I'm gonna ask you
a million more times."

36:33.562 --> 36:34.730
And he's like--

36:35.982 --> 36:37.441
Move, move!

36:37.441 --> 36:38.567
Go!

36:39.610 --> 36:41.320
- The fuck is that comin' from?
- Shut up.

36:50.663 --> 36:53.082
Shit. Alright, fuck. Let's move. Let's go.

36:53.082 --> 36:55.126
- What are you doin'?
- Gettin' the fuck outta here!

36:55.126 --> 36:56.711
Oh shit, oh shit!

37:01.215 --> 37:02.550
What do we do?

37:09.306 --> 37:10.683
All right.

37:10.683 --> 37:11.726
Stay here.

37:11.726 --> 37:12.601
What?

37:13.728 --> 37:16.355
If you don't move, he's not gonna hit you.

37:16.355 --> 37:19.108
I'm gonna go around,
try to get in the house through the back,

37:19.108 --> 37:20.067
and then I'll take him out.

37:20.067 --> 37:21.610
But if you go out there,
he's gonna kill you.

37:21.610 --> 37:23.029
It's dark and he has shit aim.

37:23.029 --> 37:24.071
Nobody's gonna kill me.

37:24.071 --> 37:25.406
Then he's gonna kill us.

37:27.825 --> 37:29.326
Do you trust me?

38:53.327 --> 38:56.247
Put the gun down, slide it over to me

38:57.123 --> 38:58.958
and then stay up here for another hour.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.503
That's all you have to do.

39:06.006 --> 39:07.675
Please don't do it.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.218
Please.

39:28.988 --> 39:31.782
<i>Anthony? Anthony?</i>

39:34.994 --> 39:36.787
<i>Anthony, hold them where they are.</i>

39:36.787 --> 39:37.997
<i>We're almost there.</i>

39:37.997 --> 39:39.498
Fuck.

39:40.457 --> 39:41.750
Run!

39:45.629 --> 39:46.755
Run!

39:50.259 --> 39:51.177
Run!

39:52.553 --> 39:54.513
<i>There's cars everywhere.</i>

39:54.513 --> 39:56.932
Why do you think you're in front?
Clear them.

40:03.022 --> 40:04.440
Go! Go, go, go, go!

41:15.594 --> 41:16.929
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:24.395 --> 41:25.771
- He's up there.
- Fuck.

41:25.771 --> 41:28.399
Two and two!
Around the back, take him out!

41:33.529 --> 41:35.072
Dead end, Henry.

41:36.031 --> 41:39.243
Gonna step on out?
Save us some time?

41:41.745 --> 41:42.663
No?

41:44.623 --> 41:46.542
That's all right. Doesn't matter.

41:50.838 --> 41:51.964
I'll come out!

41:53.632 --> 41:55.175
Just let the kids go!

41:55.718 --> 41:56.927
No.

41:56.927 --> 41:58.137
Sorry.

41:59.096 --> 42:00.889
The girl is with the man who killed Bryan.

42:00.889 --> 42:02.516
And Sam

42:03.434 --> 42:05.436
- well, Sam's with you.
- You don't understand!

42:05.436 --> 42:06.937
But I do.

42:06.937 --> 42:08.939
I know why you did what you did.

42:10.149 --> 42:13.736
But did you ever stop to think
that maybe he was supposed to die?

42:13.736 --> 42:14.945
He's just a fucking kid!

42:17.197 --> 42:19.283
Well, kids die, Henry.

42:19.283 --> 42:21.285
They die all the time.

42:22.578 --> 42:25.789
You think the whole world
revolves around him?

42:25.789 --> 42:27.624
That he's worth

42:28.375 --> 42:29.835
everything?

42:30.586 --> 42:34.381
Well, this is what happens
when you fuck with fate.

42:38.135 --> 42:41.055
Get ready to take him and run. Yes.

42:42.139 --> 42:43.057
Do it.

42:47.644 --> 42:49.188
It's time, Henry.

42:49.938 --> 42:50.856
Enough!

42:56.236 --> 42:57.446
Okay.

43:22.805 --> 43:24.932
It ends the way it ends.

44:32.291 --> 44:33.208
No!

44:45.888 --> 44:48.307
Run 'em down! Run 'em down!

45:43.403 --> 45:45.906
Run. Find cover. Don't look back.

45:46.740 --> 45:47.658
Run!

46:29.616 --> 46:31.493
Help! Get the fuck away!

46:31.493 --> 46:32.911
Get the fuck off me!

46:59.187 --> 47:00.105
Sam!

47:03.942 --> 47:05.402
Come on, come on!

47:06.320 --> 47:07.654
Go, go!

47:13.869 --> 47:14.953
Stop!

47:33.263 --> 47:35.349
This way now! Move!

47:57.162 --> 47:58.497
"Pew.

48:01.249 --> 48:02.209
"Pew.

48:02.209 --> 48:03.794
"As the Raven 01

48:03.794 --> 48:05.379
approaches the red planet."

48:05.379 --> 48:06.546
You think they'll be okay?

48:07.673 --> 48:09.216
Yeah, I think.

48:11.551 --> 48:13.178
It's easier when you're a kid anyway.

48:19.601 --> 48:21.728
You don't have anybody else
relying on you.

48:23.271 --> 48:24.815
That's the hard part.

48:25.524 --> 48:26.316
Well,

48:27.359 --> 48:28.735
I guess we're doing a good job then.

48:32.489 --> 48:34.491
What's that comic book say?

48:34.491 --> 48:37.703
-"Endure and survive"?
-"Endure and survive."

48:40.414 --> 48:42.582
- That shit's redundant.
- Yeah, it's not great.

48:42.582 --> 48:44.126
No.

48:49.256 --> 48:51.425
Look, I don't know exactly
how I'm gettin' to Wyoming.

48:51.425 --> 48:52.926
I'm probably walkin'.

48:53.760 --> 48:54.678
But

48:56.513 --> 48:58.473
- you know, if you want to.
- Yeah.

48:59.391 --> 49:00.183
Yeah.

49:02.978 --> 49:04.896
Yeah, I think it'd be nice
for Sam to have a friend.

49:06.106 --> 49:07.649
I'll tell him in the morning.

49:09.484 --> 49:10.902
New day, new start.

49:13.488 --> 49:14.823
"Bingo!

49:16.199 --> 49:17.701
Should we knock?"

49:19.244 --> 49:20.579
Hey.

49:53.361 --> 49:55.155
"I don't see any weird movements.

49:55.155 --> 49:57.365
"Stiff? Negative.

49:57.365 --> 49:59.201
"Damage here in Sector 153.

49:59.201 --> 50:00.827
"Stella, can you hear me?

50:01.453 --> 50:02.412
I read you."

50:02.412 --> 50:04.039
Okay, from here.

50:23.600 --> 50:26.853
Do I not look scared?

50:41.243 --> 50:42.160
"Never."

50:49.209 --> 50:52.754
I'm scared all the time

51:05.100 --> 51:06.643
of scorpions!

51:58.111 --> 52:00.238
monster is it still you inside?

52:08.538 --> 52:09.664
Fuck.

52:30.727 --> 52:31.853
My blood

52:32.854 --> 52:34.606
is medicine.

53:41.548 --> 53:42.882
I promise.

53:47.679 --> 53:50.432
Promise. Promise.

54:22.881 --> 54:23.757
Hey.

54:46.029 --> 54:48.323
- Nope, nope, nope.
- Joel!

54:50.909 --> 54:52.452
Joel!

55:06.508 --> 55:07.425
Ellie.

55:10.553 --> 55:11.888
Are you okay?

55:18.436 --> 55:19.979
Easy, easy, easy.

55:20.814 --> 55:24.025
Henry, gimme the gun.

55:24.025 --> 55:25.443
What did I do?

55:26.152 --> 55:27.529
What did I do?

55:28.696 --> 55:30.281
What-what-what did I do?

55:32.408 --> 55:34.327
- Sam?
- Henry, gimme the gun.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.081
Gimme the gun.

55:38.873 --> 55:40.416
Gimme the gun, Henry.

55:41.126 --> 55:42.669
Gimme the gun.

55:42.669 --> 55:43.878
Henry, no!

55:46.923 --> 55:48.216
Oh God.

56:53.615 --> 56:55.366
Which way's west?

57:20.391 --> 57:21.643
Let's go.
