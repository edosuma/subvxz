00:00.834 --> 00:02.069

- He has not eaten
in a long time.

00:02.169 --> 00:04.771
We think that boy's
being abused.

00:04.872 --> 00:06.240
- You know you abuse
your kids.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.375
Y'all been making them
eat that stuff y'all cooking.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.244

the sheriff.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.945
You know he can make it
rough for ya, right?

00:12.045 --> 00:13.146
- We think he's in trouble,
for real.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.349
- I saw sadness
in that boy's face today.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.483
- Alright, we'll talk
to him.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.219
- You are welcome to dinner
here anytime.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.354
- Why did you invite him here?

00:20.454 --> 00:21.989
I don't want him here
again.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.490
- What in the world
is going on?

00:25.676 --> 00:28.079

00:42.493 --> 00:44.095
- Uh, yeah, I was just

00:44.195 --> 00:45.429
- Well, let me do
that for you, baby.

00:45.529 --> 00:47.431
- Cora, no, no, no.
- No, I got it.

00:47.531 --> 00:49.400

about that?

00:49.500 --> 00:50.534
- I insist, yes.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.169
Let it go, baby, I got it.
- Thank you.

00:52.269 --> 00:55.373
- No, she insist because
she say you can't cook.

00:55.473 --> 00:56.941
- Mr. Brown.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.442
[laughs] Don't pay him--

00:58.542 --> 01:01.112
Mr. Brown, will you go get
the groceries out of the car?

01:01.212 --> 01:02.546
- Cora, you know
I'm telling the truth.

01:02.647 --> 01:04.448
- You just popped up
out of nowhere.

01:04.548 --> 01:06.150
- Well, that's 'cause
I popped up out of the place

01:06.250 --> 01:07.585
I open.
I opened this place.

01:07.685 --> 01:09.920
- That's the only part
of this place you popped up on.

01:10.021 --> 01:13.658
- I opened up 50% of the place,
so I'm popping up out of 50%.

01:13.758 --> 01:15.693
- Oh, will you just go get
the groceries out of the car?

01:15.793 --> 01:17.261
- Why you trying to get
an attitude with me

01:17.361 --> 01:18.863
and get mad?
- Mr. Brown.

01:18.963 --> 01:20.264
- You know you said that
girl can't cook.

01:20.364 --> 01:21.365
- Would you--
- Did you say

01:21.465 --> 01:22.700
she can't cook?
- Get out of here!

01:22.800 --> 01:25.036
- Look at me in my face.
- I'm looking you in your face.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.505
Get out of here.
- You said she can't cook.

01:27.605 --> 01:29.407
You trying to get attitude
with me 'cause you done said

01:29.507 --> 01:30.975
she can't cook.
- Okay, Mr. Brown, just--

01:31.075 --> 01:32.009
- That's what you're trying
to do.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.210
- Would you--
- Tell the truth

01:33.311 --> 01:34.512
and shame the devil.
Do you promise to swear

01:34.612 --> 01:35.746
to tell the truth, but
the whole--

01:35.846 --> 01:37.782
- I'm gonna shame you if
you don't get out of here.

01:37.882 --> 01:40.017
Go on.
- Ow, you hurt my fibia.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.186
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Leah,
sweetheart.

01:42.286 --> 01:44.188
Oh, I--I got this.
I got this.

01:44.221 --> 01:45.189
Let me--let me get this

01:48.626 --> 01:51.495
I'm gonna get it stirred up
for you in just a sec.

01:51.595 --> 01:53.998
- So, um, you say I can't cook,
huh, Cora?

01:54.098 --> 01:56.233
- Oh, well, I didn't say that.

01:56.334 --> 01:57.435
- Well, what did you say?

01:57.535 --> 01:58.836
'Cause I don't know you
to lie.

01:58.936 --> 02:02.206
- Well, uh, I was just saying
this may not be your thing,

02:02.306 --> 02:03.874
you know? Cooking.
- What? What? What?

02:03.975 --> 02:05.910
Ah.
- Cook--okay, I'm sorry.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.945
I did say you can't cook.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.081
- Well, see, okay, I know
I'm not the best.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.382
- Well, that's okay, but
I can teach ya.

02:11.482 --> 02:12.650
I can show you a few things.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.620
Just hold on. First...
- Okay. Thank you.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.089
- This is what we do first,
honey, is you get you

02:18.222 --> 02:21.125
some seasonings first.
- Seasoning first.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.327
- Seasonings, yes.
What else you got?

02:25.663 --> 02:27.932
Mayo?
- Yes.

02:28.032 --> 02:30.701
- Mayonnaise?
- Everybody like ranch.

02:30.801 --> 02:33.170
- Ranch? No.

02:33.270 --> 02:35.006
- [indistinct mumbling]

02:35.172 --> 02:38.175
Cheese and maybe do a little
almond or something like that.

02:38.275 --> 02:40.378
- No, no, no, baby,
first of all,

02:40.478 --> 02:43.347
you never use canned tomatoes.

02:43.447 --> 02:46.183
If you gonna make an omelette,
you gonna use fresh tomatoes.

02:46.217 --> 02:47.652
- Fresh--okay, I'll put this
back.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.654
- Yes, and, uh...

02:49.754 --> 02:52.089
nacho cheese? What you gonna do
with nacho cheese?

02:52.189 --> 02:53.624
- People like cheese in
their eggs.

02:53.724 --> 02:55.826
Cheese eggs.
- We're gonna use fresh cheese,

02:55.926 --> 02:57.395
shredded. There you go, baby.

02:57.495 --> 02:59.830
You can put that back.
Back. I gotcha.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.067
Alright, you can--now,
okay.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.201
- LEAH: Okay, I'm putting
'em back.

03:04.235 --> 03:05.236
- Okay, alright, so--
- LEAH: Okay.

03:05.336 --> 03:07.104
- So, are you okay, sweetheart?

03:07.204 --> 03:09.407
- [sighs] No, I'm not
okay.

03:09.507 --> 03:11.375
- Well--well, what's going on?

03:11.475 --> 03:14.512
- That lovely daughter
of mine is uhh.

03:14.612 --> 03:15.913
- Oh, Sandra?

03:16.013 --> 03:17.815
- [sighs] Yes, Ma'am.

03:17.915 --> 03:19.617
- Well, girl, let me get me
a cup of coffee,

03:19.717 --> 03:21.852
get ready for this.
- I'm gonna take one too.

03:39.912 --> 03:41.080

- So what happened?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.682

- Well, last night, she said
she didn't want anything

03:42.782 --> 03:44.684

to do with Mr. Lindor.

03:44.784 --> 03:46.018

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:46.118 --> 03:49.055

- Oh my.
- That's crazy to me.

03:49.155 --> 03:50.156

- Now where did that come from?

03:50.256 --> 03:51.624

- I have no idea.
What was it?

03:51.724 --> 03:55.327

Like five minutes ago she said
she was, "In love with the boy."

03:55.428 --> 03:57.997

- [laughs] Well, she seemed
like she really liked him.

03:58.097 --> 03:59.565

- That's what I thought.
- CORA: Mm.

03:59.665 --> 04:01.133

And now she don't wanna
be with him?

04:01.233 --> 04:03.069

- It was a whole shebang-bang.

04:03.169 --> 04:05.071

- Wow.
- Suh.

04:05.171 --> 04:06.872

- There's more to that story.
- Uh.

04:06.972 --> 04:08.741

You ain't got to tell me.

04:08.841 --> 04:11.610

- So, honey, let me tell you
something though.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.446

The thing about it is,
when your kids bring home

04:13.546 --> 04:15.081

somebody that the parents
don't like--

04:15.181 --> 04:16.449

- Mm-hmm.
- --it makes them just

04:16.549 --> 04:18.818

dive in just that harder
to prove you wrong.

04:18.918 --> 04:21.620

- Ooh, and will get under
your skin about it.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.123

- Yes, but when y'all
embraced him, you know,

04:24.223 --> 04:25.725
that took all the fun
out of it.

04:25.825 --> 04:27.460
- You mean just because
we like him,

04:27.560 --> 04:28.561
now she doesn't like him?

04:28.661 --> 04:31.664
- Yes, that's how
it goes.

04:31.764 --> 04:34.533
If you like him, then--then they
wanna run 'em away then.

04:34.633 --> 04:35.801
- Oh.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.503
- Y'all probably broke 'em
up by y'all liking him.

04:37.603 --> 04:39.305
- Huh-uh, don't you do that.
Don't you put that on me.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.239
- [laughs] Well, yeah.

04:40.306 --> 04:41.841
Well, I'm just kidding.

04:41.941 --> 04:45.077
Now if you go back to hating
him, they'll get back together.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.612
- Mm.
- And that's what you really

04:46.712 --> 04:48.147
want in the end though.
- Oh my God.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.348
- 'Cause he seems like
a good kid.

04:49.448 --> 04:51.083
- He does seem like
a good kid.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.253
I don't know, but we like
him.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.256
But we're afraid that he
might be being abused.

04:57.323 --> 05:00.993
- Really?
So what did he say?

05:01.093 --> 05:02.695
- Nothing.

05:02.795 --> 05:04.997
Cora, there was a--I don't
know, it's just like

05:05.097 --> 05:08.567
a sadness with that kid.
- Really?

05:08.667 --> 05:10.703
- I just felt all in my spirit
that something is wrong

05:10.803 --> 05:12.805
in his home.
- Well, you know what?

05:12.905 --> 05:14.407
You just have to follow
your heart.

05:14.507 --> 05:17.109
- [sighs] I hear you.
- But you can't turn your backs,

05:17.276 --> 05:18.711
especially when kids
are involved.

05:18.811 --> 05:19.979
- Yeah.

05:21.514 --> 05:23.749
But I just don't know how
we find out what's going on.

05:23.849 --> 05:24.784
- Don't worry about that,
baby.

05:24.884 --> 05:26.819
All things will come
to the light.

05:26.919 --> 05:28.821
- Don't it?
- Yes, it will. Trust me.

05:28.921 --> 05:29.922
- Yeah.
- It will.

05:30.022 --> 05:31.390
But until then--
- Mm-hmm.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.692
- --come on over here, I'm gonna
show you

05:32.792 --> 05:34.527
how to cook a few things.
- Mm.

05:34.627 --> 05:36.195
Yes, show me how
to cook a few things,

05:36.295 --> 05:37.563
'cause this a mean cup
of joe right here.

05:37.663 --> 05:39.065
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.231 --> 05:40.933
- That's all I do.
[laughs]

05:41.033 --> 05:43.135
- [doorbell rings]
- Alright, first of all--

05:43.235 --> 05:46.038
- Okay.
- --this is a stove.

05:46.138 --> 05:49.141
- Oh, ha-ha, Cora.
- I'm just kidding with ya.

05:49.241 --> 05:50.376
- Very funny.
- I'm kidding with ya.

05:50.476 --> 05:51.610
- That ain't funny, Cora,
that's cold-blooded.

05:51.711 --> 05:54.013
You're just cold--gonna tell,
"This is a stove."

05:54.113 --> 05:56.148
- You're so messy.
- Now you really know Cora

05:56.248 --> 05:58.517
say you couldn't cook.

05:58.617 --> 05:59.985
- No, no, honey--
- Mr. Brown.

06:00.086 --> 06:01.587
- Cora, didn't you tell me
she be cooking stuff

06:01.687 --> 06:03.622
in the microwave?
- Mr. Brown. Ssh.

06:03.723 --> 06:05.491
- She cooked the whole dinner
in the microwave?

06:05.591 --> 06:07.460
- You talk too much, I can't
tell you nothing.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.329
- Maybe she should get
acquainted with the stove.

06:10.429 --> 06:13.666
Hey, this is a burner.
- [laughs]

06:13.766 --> 06:15.501
- This is a bowl.
- Okay.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.269
- Would you stop it?
- I got this one.

06:17.303 --> 06:19.839
This is a trash can for
bad food.

06:19.939 --> 06:22.508
- Ooh, Mr. Brown!
- I'll help you out.

06:22.608 --> 06:24.310
- Don't do that.
- Oh my gosh, okay.

06:24.410 --> 06:27.680
- This is ranch to cover up
the nasty flavor.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.382
- Would you stop it?
- I shouldn't have said that.

06:29.482 --> 06:30.449
- No, you shouldn't have
said that.

06:30.549 --> 06:31.484
- I'm gonna put
the groceries up.

06:31.584 --> 06:32.451
- Please, put the groceries up.

06:32.551 --> 06:34.487
I'm so sorry, baby.
- Oh my--

06:34.587 --> 06:36.322
- Good morning.
- Well, good morning.

06:36.422 --> 06:40.059
- Oh, what up, dawg?
Ah! Ah! Ah!

06:40.226 --> 06:42.128
- BOTH: Shut up!
- Look at you!

06:42.228 --> 06:43.229
That's my homegirl.

06:43.329 --> 06:44.730
- When did y'all become
best buddies?

06:44.830 --> 06:46.298
- Oh, we just--
- We just did, yeah.

06:46.399 --> 06:48.234
- --we vibe. Well, you heard me.

06:48.267 --> 06:51.537

06:51.637 --> 06:52.905

put up the groceries?

06:53.005 --> 06:54.907
- Yeah, I got some time
before I have to go to school.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.711
- Hi.
- Hey, can you or Dad

06:58.811 --> 07:01.313
take me school?
- You don't wanna ride the bus?

07:01.414 --> 07:03.049
- Mom.
- No, Sandra, okay,

07:03.149 --> 07:04.083
baby, don't do this.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.385
We just started getting along,
okay?

07:06.485 --> 07:08.354
- Why do you want him
to come to dinner?

07:08.454 --> 07:10.322
- We just do.
- Okay, well, you do

07:10.423 --> 07:12.291
what you want, I won't
be here.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.260
- Sandra.

07:14.293 --> 07:16.362
Sandra.

07:16.462 --> 07:18.264
What is going on?

07:18.297 --> 07:20.766
- Nothing. Nothing's going on.

07:20.866 --> 07:22.601
- What happened between
you and Lindor?

07:22.702 --> 07:24.303
- Nothing happened.
- Okay, well, why don't you

07:24.403 --> 07:25.805

15:13.385 --> 15:14.819
- And I can't depend on you
to do nothing.

15:14.919 --> 15:16.121
I'll do it myself.

15:16.221 --> 15:17.355
- Do it yourself then.
- Yes, 'cause--

15:17.522 --> 15:19.291
'cause you and that over there,
ain't over here.

15:19.391 --> 15:20.358
- [phone ringing]
- I'll look at

15:20.525 --> 15:21.826
the applications myself.
- Okay.

15:21.926 --> 15:23.595
Pleasant Days.

15:23.695 --> 15:25.530
Yes, this is Mr. Brown.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.732
Oh, they calling about

15:29.601 --> 15:31.102

15:31.202 --> 15:32.570

Lindor all night.

15:50.155 --> 15:53.058
- Yeah, me too.

15:53.158 --> 15:55.160
- You know what? I think
I'm gonna call his daddy,

15:55.260 --> 15:57.462
have a little talk with him.

15:57.562 --> 15:59.798
- Mm. You think that's a good
idea?

15:59.898 --> 16:00.899
- I think so.

16:00.999 --> 16:02.133
- [sighs] I don't know, baby.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.869
If he is being abused...

16:04.970 --> 16:08.039
that might make it worse.

16:08.139 --> 16:10.075
- Yeah, and I didn't even
think about that.

16:10.175 --> 16:13.078
- Maybe we should just
wait.

16:13.178 --> 16:14.512
- Wait for what?

16:14.579 --> 16:17.515
- You know, sometimes you
gotta just stand still.

16:17.615 --> 16:19.584
- Yeah.
Okay.

16:22.287 --> 16:23.955
- Let me ask you something.

16:24.055 --> 16:25.790
- Oh boy.

16:25.890 --> 16:28.893
- Is this your first wife?

16:28.994 --> 16:30.862
- This is my only wife.

16:30.962 --> 16:33.632
- This year.
- Grandpa.

16:33.732 --> 16:36.935
- What y'all need to do is stay
out of grown folk's business.

16:37.035 --> 16:39.237
- Man, you just worried
about this place.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.906
- Yes, I'm worried
about this place.

16:42.007 --> 16:44.042
- Uh, what about this place?

16:44.142 --> 16:46.044
- They wanna go up and
talk to the sheriff.

16:46.144 --> 16:47.212
- About what?

16:47.312 --> 16:50.181
- They think
he's abusing his son.

16:50.281 --> 16:52.450
- Oh, well then maybe they
might need to talk to him.

16:52.550 --> 16:53.752
- Thank you.

16:53.852 --> 16:55.387
- The man knows the mayor
and the building inspector,

16:55.553 --> 16:58.290
which means we may not
get our permit today.

16:58.390 --> 17:00.125
- Oh, in that case,
that boy be fine.

17:00.225 --> 17:01.660
- That's what I'm saying.
- He's gonna be alright.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.827
- Right.
- Mr. Brown.

17:02.927 --> 17:04.162
- What is it, Cora? I teach
the boy

17:04.262 --> 17:06.097
how to stick and move, jab.
- Would you stop it?

17:06.197 --> 17:07.899
- And while he sticking and
moving,

17:07.999 --> 17:10.101
he need to run tiny steps.
- Okay, okay,

17:10.201 --> 17:11.503
stop it,
you two.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.738
- Hey, hey, if that mean I'm
not gonna be able to get

17:13.838 --> 17:16.141
my money back, y'all don't need
to talk to nobody.

17:16.241 --> 17:19.411
- Mr. Brown, the boy
may be in trouble.

17:19.511 --> 17:20.845
- Right.

17:20.945 --> 17:22.614
- Well, y'all going up there,
you gonna mess up everything.

17:22.714 --> 17:26.017
- Grandpa, I am telling you,
this is for the best.

17:26.117 --> 17:27.819
- It ain't for the best
if I ain't gonna get my

17:27.919 --> 17:29.721
$40,000 back.
- $40,000.

17:29.821 --> 17:32.123
- Okay, okay. We need to get
ready for these interviews.

17:32.223 --> 17:33.925
- Cora, don't nobody want
no nurse.

17:34.025 --> 17:35.427
- Let me see what you got.
- --a nurse now.

17:35.527 --> 17:36.695
- Let's see.
- For what, Cora?

17:36.795 --> 17:38.296
- See, look, we got several
ones to pick from.

17:38.396 --> 17:40.131
- Cora, I don't want
that one there.

17:40.231 --> 17:41.566
- Well, what's wrong with her?
- Come on now,

17:41.666 --> 17:44.602
maybe we can hire her.
- Yeah, well, I guess.

17:44.703 --> 17:46.538
- Well, she don't have no
qualifications.

17:46.638 --> 17:48.573
- [laughs] Sorry, Cora,
I'm looking at two

17:48.673 --> 17:52.344
qualifications right now.
- She grown.

17:52.444 --> 17:54.079

Are you getting tingles?

17:54.179 --> 17:55.714
- I'm getting tingly.
- Would you get out of here?

17:55.814 --> 17:57.449
Get out of here, y'all.
Go get the rooms ready

17:57.549 --> 17:59.551
for these interviews, please.
- Alright, but I loved

17:59.584 --> 18:02.120
to see her walk around here
in a short nurse outfit.

18:02.220 --> 18:04.556
- What's that for?
- Let me take your temperature.

18:06.691 --> 18:08.593
With a butt thermometer.

18:08.693 --> 18:11.496
- Baby, we can't be afraid
of the sheriff.

18:11.563 --> 18:12.731
- I know.

18:12.831 --> 18:14.499
- Well, y'all gotta do what
you gotta do, alright?

18:14.566 --> 18:16.201
