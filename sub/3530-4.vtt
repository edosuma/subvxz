WEBVTT

00:08.035 --> 00:11.971
To ensure that the Scots
cease their... impertinence.

00:11.972 --> 00:13.359
I haven't seen you
for a good while.

00:13.360 --> 00:17.218
I trust you found something to
amuse yourself when I was away?

00:17.219 --> 00:20.340
I missed your Majesty so much.

00:20.341 --> 00:21.766
I was just thinking of

00:21.767 --> 00:23.603
those who are no longer
here to sup with us.

00:23.604 --> 00:25.628
I had a moment of nostalgia-

00:25.629 --> 00:27.225
even for my enemies.

00:27.226 --> 00:28.664
We must agree on these plans

00:28.665 --> 00:30.238
for our much-delayed
progress to the North.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.663
We shall take
men-at-arms-since we mean

00:31.664 --> 00:33.495
especially to visit
those parts of our realm

00:33.496 --> 00:35.161
which, not long ago,

00:35.162 --> 00:37.490
rose up in treacherous
rebellion against us.

00:37.491 --> 00:40.183
You promise never again
to make unlawful assembly.

00:40.184 --> 00:42.947
In return, his Majesty
will grant you mercy.

00:42.948 --> 00:44.491
Here is your son, Prince Edward.

00:44.492 --> 00:46.349
I can see your mother in you.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.778
Do you know who she was?

00:48.537 --> 00:53.255
This is her.
And this is her thimble.

00:53.256 --> 00:55.119
You're a good boy.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.484
Katherine, I've come to
tell you we're leaving

00:56.485 --> 00:57.707
Whitehall in two days.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.933
The Lady Mary will be accompanying us.
Must she come?

00:59.934 --> 01:01.683
Mary is a much-loved
figure in the North

01:01.684 --> 01:03.742
where we mean to
impress our subjects.

01:03.743 --> 01:05.872
The decision has
nothing to do with you.

01:06.059 --> 01:07.356
There were these two gallants;

01:07.357 --> 01:10.460
They found a way to call
upon Katherine and me.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.216
Katherine with this
Francis Dereham?

01:12.217 --> 01:13.956
- Yes!
- What then?

01:13.957 --> 01:16.356
They would be kissing.
And the two of them would

01:16.357 --> 01:19.762
hang by their bellies
like two sparrows.

01:19.763 --> 01:20.905
I want to see him again.

01:20.906 --> 01:23.592
I only urge your
Majesty to be careful.

01:23.593 --> 01:26.242
What? Don't you think I know
how to meddle with a man?

01:26.243 --> 01:28.281
I wanted to visit
the Queen tonight.

01:28.282 --> 01:32.351
She looked so pure and beautiful
today, don't you think?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.709
Jesus Christ!

Pontefract Castle
Yorkshier Northern England

02:53.870 --> 02:56.201
The King approaches!

02:57.000 --> 02:58.971
His Majesty's coming!

03:04.139 --> 03:05.696
Ready!

03:06.600 --> 03:08.013
Attention!

03:08.425 --> 03:11.348
Right turn!

03:23.527 --> 03:25.897
Ready!

03:47.970 --> 03:50.939
Sir Ralph, my lords and gentlemen,

03:50.940 --> 03:53.162
I thank God at last,
I have been able to come among

03:53.163 --> 03:57.045
my faithful servants in
Yorkshire and the North.

03:57.146 --> 03:59.517
Allow me to introduce my wife,

03:59.518 --> 04:02.400
Queen Katherine. - Your Majesty.

04:02.401 --> 04:05.570
And you know my eldest daughter,
the Lady Mary.

04:05.638 --> 04:07.739
My Lady.

04:07.806 --> 04:10.338
Your Majesties-and
all those with you-

04:10.339 --> 04:13.157
are welcome to Pontefract Castle.

04:13.158 --> 04:14.631
I trust your stay
here will bring you

04:14.632 --> 04:17.139
both pleasure and profit.

04:22.254 --> 04:25.390
- Sir Ralph.
- Your Majesty.

04:25.892 --> 04:27.837
Culpepper!

04:29.708 --> 04:31.607
I will sleep with
the Queen tonight.

04:31.608 --> 04:34.098
Bring her to me. - Majesty.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.099
The King seems in good spirits,
your Grace.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.403
His Majesty is very well,
Sir Ralph.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.838
He has both a new Queen and
it seems a new lease on life.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.399
His progress here has been joyful.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.475
Crowds have come out to cheer him

04:44.476 --> 04:46.010
and eminent men have made
speeches to praise him.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.479
There will be men come here too,
now and in a while;

04:48.614 --> 04:49.865
Men who once wore the emblem of

04:49.866 --> 04:52.326
rebellion came now to
express their shame for it.

04:52.327 --> 04:54.018
Right men, pull out!

04:54.489 --> 04:57.484
Welcome back to Pontefract
Castle, your Grace.

05:02.995 --> 05:05.129
Forgive me.

05:05.164 --> 05:07.889
These walls must remind
your Grace of other times.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.600
They do.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.451
I must confess to you, Sir Ralph,

05:12.452 --> 05:15.126
that this hall is filled
with ghostly presences

05:15.127 --> 05:16.841
that I should rather forget.

05:17.313 --> 05:19.310
For me, too.

05:19.445 --> 05:22.313
I know he was an arch traitor,

05:22.348 --> 05:25.316
but my Lord Darcy-Old Tom-

05:25.384 --> 05:27.652
he still seems to haunt
these battlements.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.321
I half expect to see
him on my way to bed.

05:30.389 --> 05:33.224
Tell me, truly:

05:33.325 --> 05:35.393
How do the people cope
here without their saints,

05:35.494 --> 05:37.395
their superstitions,
their monasteries?

05:37.496 --> 05:39.497
There are some-a few-

05:39.565 --> 05:42.113
who still grumble at the
empty niches in the churches,

05:42.114 --> 05:44.936
the absence of candles
and prayers for the dead.

05:44.937 --> 05:47.737
But it seems with the death
of Secretary Cromwell

05:47.738 --> 05:50.205
that the reforming
zeal has slackened.

05:50.676 --> 05:51.908
You there...

05:51.909 --> 05:54.679
Or has it? No one knows,
your Grace,

05:54.713 --> 05:57.348
whether the King means to
continue stripping the altars,

05:57.416 --> 05:59.651
or return to the old ways.

05:59.685 --> 06:01.326
They are often afraid
to open their mouths,

06:01.327 --> 06:02.854
in case they should
say the wrong thing.

06:03.268 --> 06:06.050
It is not always easy to read
the King's mind, Sir Ralph.

06:12.577 --> 06:14.399
Majesty.

06:22.451 --> 06:23.827
My Lady.

06:28.044 --> 06:29.947
Lady Rochford. - Master Culpepper.

06:37.843 --> 06:40.138
His Majesty is ready
to receive you.

06:46.066 --> 06:47.365
Later?

06:57.331 --> 06:59.833
Your Majesty, the Queen is here.

07:03.955 --> 07:07.073
Your Majesty.

07:07.174 --> 07:08.442
I have just heard that the Emperor

07:08.443 --> 07:10.243
and the King of France
are on the brink of war.

07:13.954 --> 07:16.428
Surely your Majesty does
not want to see me...

07:16.429 --> 07:18.458
At... such a time?

07:20.346 --> 07:21.757
Why?

07:22.263 --> 07:23.883
Because...

07:23.884 --> 07:27.427
You have more important matters.

07:30.364 --> 07:32.365
More important than you?

07:34.368 --> 07:36.870
Yes.

07:57.925 --> 08:01.037
Let them have their war.

08:33.232 --> 08:36.087
Do you know who died here,
in this castle?

08:36.253 --> 08:37.823
Plenty, I suspect.

08:37.825 --> 08:40.426
No. Important men.

08:40.427 --> 08:42.033
No.

08:42.034 --> 08:45.537
Richard the Second died here,
after he was deposed.

08:45.571 --> 08:47.938
He was 33 years of age.

08:47.939 --> 08:50.876
They kept him here as a prisoner.
They starved him to death.

08:50.910 --> 08:52.878
Poor ghost.

08:52.945 --> 08:54.589
He made the mistake of favouring

08:54.590 --> 08:58.043
lesser men over greater ones.

08:58.617 --> 09:01.806
For such mean creatures
are determined

09:01.807 --> 09:04.178
not just to usurp the nobility,

09:04.179 --> 09:06.958
but to destroy us altogether.

09:09.462 --> 09:13.311
Sometimes, my Lord, it may be so.

09:13.916 --> 09:16.750
But surely the King is right
where he gives offices

09:16.751 --> 09:20.444
and dignities to those
with the right qualities?

09:20.445 --> 09:24.009
No. Those men that are made

09:24.010 --> 09:26.915
by the King of vile birth
have been the distraction

09:26.916 --> 09:29.915
of all the nobility of this realm!

09:29.949 --> 09:33.309
And if God calls away the King,

09:33.310 --> 09:37.289
they will suffer for it! - My Lord,

09:37.356 --> 09:39.791
be careful not to wish
the King's life away.

09:40.401 --> 09:42.460
That is treason!

09:46.966 --> 09:48.799
Sir Thomas,

09:48.800 --> 09:52.304
I think your friend
Surrey is snarling at you.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.077
His Majesty, the King!

12:03.658 --> 12:07.005
Mr. Sidwell, your Majesty.

12:07.994 --> 12:12.088
Your Majesty, we your
humble servants confess

12:12.089 --> 12:17.859
that we wretches have
most grievously, wantonly,

12:17.860 --> 12:20.495
and heinously offended your Majesty

12:20.496 --> 12:23.331
in the most unnatural, odious,

12:23.366 --> 12:25.734
and distasteful acts

12:25.835 --> 12:30.305
of outrageous disobedience
and traitorous rebellion.

12:30.339 --> 12:33.407
We beg your Majesty
to rid your mind

12:33.408 --> 12:36.177
of any relics of indignation

12:36.178 --> 12:38.677
you might still harbour against us,

12:38.678 --> 12:42.515
and we pray henceforward
to pray ceaselessly

12:42.516 --> 12:44.214
for your preservation,

12:44.215 --> 12:48.664
and for that of your queen and
of your son, the Prince Edward,

12:48.665 --> 12:51.593
so God Almighty help us!

12:59.535 --> 13:01.536
I harbour

13:01.570 --> 13:04.942
no relics of indignation
against you.

13:04.943 --> 13:08.698
And for these shows of loyalty

13:08.699 --> 13:12.421
I forgive you all your
trespasses against us.

13:20.289 --> 13:21.923
Long live the King!

13:25.461 --> 13:27.429
The Lady Mary Tudor.

13:27.563 --> 13:30.298
There she is.

13:34.236 --> 13:36.671
Lady Mary, God bless you!

13:36.772 --> 13:37.906
God bless your Majesty!

13:38.482 --> 13:41.258
My Lady! My Lady! Wake up!

13:42.008 --> 13:44.109
Joan?

13:48.681 --> 13:49.948
What time-?

13:49.983 --> 13:51.847
Look.

13:56.288 --> 13:59.792
God bless Lady Mary!

14:00.508 --> 14:03.903
I want you to say a prayer for his Grace,
the King's Majesty.

14:03.904 --> 14:07.143
We pray for his Majesty's
long and blessed reign

14:07.144 --> 14:09.394
and for his good health.

14:09.395 --> 14:11.386
In the name of the Blessed Virgin

14:11.387 --> 14:15.280
whose only Son died
in agony for our sins.

14:15.281 --> 14:17.417
In the name of the Father, Son,

14:17.418 --> 14:21.397
and Holy Ghost, I bless all of you.

14:22.638 --> 14:24.741
All shall be well.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.744
All manner of things shall be well.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.350
Benedictus Deus.

14:36.679 --> 14:40.349
God bless his Majesty!

14:42.352 --> 14:45.421
Long live the house of Tudor!

14:48.858 --> 14:51.154
I-would be...

14:51.155 --> 14:53.729
A woodcock.

14:53.797 --> 14:55.297
Good choice.

14:55.398 --> 14:58.600
Because it's a cock.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.104
What is it?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
It's him!

15:11.311 --> 15:13.201
It is him, isn't it?

15:13.202 --> 15:15.584
Mr. Francis Dereham, your Majesty.

15:26.039 --> 15:27.796
Your Majesty.

15:29.766 --> 15:31.254
Mr. Dereham.

15:31.255 --> 15:34.618
Francis, please- your Majesty.

15:34.619 --> 15:36.171
Why have you come here?

15:36.272 --> 15:38.172
I came to give you this.

15:38.173 --> 15:39.519
What is it? -

15:39.520 --> 15:42.585
A letter of recommendation
from the Dowager Duchess.

15:42.586 --> 15:45.514
You remember the Duchess,
don't you, your Majesty?

15:47.917 --> 15:49.784
Why do you need such a letter?

15:49.785 --> 15:50.871
I believe such a thing

15:50.872 --> 15:53.576
is obligatory if one
is seeking employment.

15:54.557 --> 15:56.201
When you read it,
you will see that since

15:56.202 --> 15:59.561
we last met I have held a
number of responsible positions

15:59.562 --> 16:01.382
in the Duchess's household,

16:01.383 --> 16:04.068
for which she freely commends me.

16:05.738 --> 16:09.479
It is not possible for me
to offer you employment...

16:09.480 --> 16:12.549
Francis.

16:14.489 --> 16:16.456
But why not?

16:16.491 --> 16:19.059
You must keep a
large establishment.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.994
But do you have a secretary?

16:21.062 --> 16:23.554
I would make an
excellent secretary.

16:23.555 --> 16:26.979
Surely you can understand why
I cannot offer you anything?

16:27.580 --> 16:30.428
But you employed Joan Bulmer,
didn't you?

16:30.429 --> 16:32.261
And she knows what I know.

16:32.262 --> 16:35.266
So-what is the difference?

16:35.947 --> 16:39.064
I was bound to notice that one
of your ladies announced me.

16:39.896 --> 16:41.793
Does that mean you have
no usher for your chamber?

16:41.794 --> 16:44.018
I am very sure you ought to,

16:44.019 --> 16:46.858
considering who you are.

16:47.901 --> 16:50.145
I can't...

16:50.146 --> 16:53.889
Oh, but you can, your Majesty.

16:53.890 --> 16:57.252
You are, after all,
the Queen of England.

16:57.577 --> 16:59.754
You can do as you will.

17:04.048 --> 17:05.704
All right.

17:05.704 --> 17:08.848
Just take care what
words you speak!

17:08.848 --> 17:11.106
Your Majesty.

17:24.467 --> 17:27.636
Your Majesty,
the French Ambassador.

17:28.354 --> 17:31.440
- Excellency!
- Your Majesty.

17:32.098 --> 17:33.800
I trust you will not forget
to convey to your master

17:33.801 --> 17:35.296
what you have seen here today:

17:35.297 --> 17:37.666
Thousands of former
rebels come to offer

17:37.667 --> 17:39.519
their supplication to
their anointed King!

17:39.520 --> 17:40.642
I will, of course,

17:40.643 --> 17:43.356
convey these tremendous
events to his Majesty.

17:43.357 --> 17:47.225
No. You will tell him,
based on what you have seen,

17:47.226 --> 17:48.440
that it would be foolish

17:48.441 --> 17:50.530
to contemplate an
invasion of this island

17:50.531 --> 17:53.060
in the mistaken belief
that it is riven

17:53.061 --> 17:56.909
with religious discord and
full of discontented men.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.539
Majesty, I am very sure

17:59.540 --> 18:02.111
that my master has no such plans.

18:02.112 --> 18:05.543
On the contrary, he regards
England as his natural ally

18:05.544 --> 18:07.780
against the Emperor.

18:15.589 --> 18:18.591
Good. Excellency.

18:24.884 --> 18:28.612
Your Grace, what preparations
are made for our visit to York?

18:28.613 --> 18:31.189
Majesty, chambers are being
made ready for your Majesty

18:31.190 --> 18:33.772
in the former abbey of St.
Mary, and furnished

18:33.773 --> 18:36.417
with your Majesty's tapestries
and plate brought from London.

18:36.418 --> 18:38.924
Tents are also being erected
in the Abbey grounds

18:38.925 --> 18:40.328
to accommodate your court

18:40.329 --> 18:42.740
and that of King James's
court when he arrives.

18:42.741 --> 18:44.947
Good.

18:44.948 --> 18:46.909
Sweetheart, how are you?

18:46.910 --> 18:50.181
I am well, thank you...
your Majesty.

18:52.408 --> 18:55.416
I must tell your Majesty
that today I appointed

18:55.417 --> 18:59.261
a new Private Secretary
and Usher to my Chambers.

19:03.629 --> 19:06.293
What-will you write letters now?

19:06.988 --> 19:09.026
You don't mind?

19:09.027 --> 19:11.596
Of course not. I've told you
you must do what you will.

19:16.984 --> 19:18.568
Thank you.

19:18.569 --> 19:19.923
Uncle.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.619
Uncle.

19:26.744 --> 19:28.912
Madam, your good health!

19:31.871 --> 19:34.423
Thank you, your Grace.

20:05.718 --> 20:07.784
Hello, Joan.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.162
Just like old times, eh?

20:19.163 --> 20:20.894
No.

20:21.265 --> 20:24.534
These times is different, Francis.
You know that very well.

20:24.535 --> 20:26.686
Just imagine, Joanie! Our Kate,

20:26.687 --> 20:29.556
our little Katie is
Queen of England.

20:30.308 --> 20:32.561
She's not our Kate anymore.

20:33.445 --> 20:34.629
She belongs to him.

20:34.630 --> 20:38.259
She belongs to the King-
and don't you forget it.

20:38.260 --> 20:41.701
Don't you ever get any ideas
into that mind of yours.

20:41.702 --> 20:43.725
What kind of ideas?

20:43.726 --> 20:47.407
You know very well
what I'm talking about.

20:47.475 --> 20:49.843
Those days are over, Francis.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.745
They're dead!

20:51.846 --> 20:54.414
This is a good living.

20:54.515 --> 20:58.051
This is the highest living
you or I could ever dream of!

21:00.664 --> 21:03.952
For God's sake, don't spoil it.

21:03.953 --> 21:06.793
Not for us and not for her!

21:09.063 --> 21:12.695
So-where am I to sleep?

21:14.045 --> 21:17.456
Not here. Not with us!

21:18.195 --> 21:20.099
For heaven's sake-

21:20.100 --> 21:22.516
you must ask the King's
chamberlain for a place.

21:24.048 --> 21:25.478
Do you understand?

21:25.513 --> 21:27.890
I suppose so.

21:37.568 --> 21:39.191
What's that?

21:39.192 --> 21:41.187
Just a kiss.

21:41.709 --> 21:43.863
For old times' sake!

22:04.172 --> 22:06.219
Who's there?

22:36.037 --> 22:38.440
My Lord Darcy.

22:41.886 --> 22:43.423
Your Grace.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.040
You're dead.

23:03.041 --> 23:06.247
Yes-but not yet at rest.

23:06.248 --> 23:09.261
The living don't know
that the recent dead

23:09.262 --> 23:11.084
are always around them.

23:11.085 --> 23:14.619
We go here and there,
to do penance,

23:14.620 --> 23:17.524
to make sure our
relatives are well,

23:17.525 --> 23:20.929
while we await our second death.

23:21.644 --> 23:23.467
Why do you appear to me?

23:23.468 --> 23:25.934
I am among the Dead.

23:26.002 --> 23:27.822
I have joined the ghosts

23:27.823 --> 23:30.992
of all your victims, your Grace.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.710
But do not grieve too much,

23:32.711 --> 23:34.897
for they are not bitter.

23:35.015 --> 23:37.029
Even the children think of nothing

23:37.030 --> 23:38.908
but stopping this endless motion,

23:38.909 --> 23:40.520
this rushing here and there,

23:40.521 --> 23:43.222
like doubles of our earthly selves.

23:43.290 --> 23:47.060
And when we have settled
all our accounts,

23:48.283 --> 23:54.901
the angels will come to take
us to the place of rest.

23:55.002 --> 23:57.981
I wish you had not bothered me.

23:57.982 --> 24:01.240
But now I would not have you go.

24:01.308 --> 24:04.243
I am not really here.

24:05.014 --> 24:07.248
But I can see you

24:07.249 --> 24:09.580
and hear you.

24:09.581 --> 24:12.585
You are Darcy.

24:12.586 --> 24:16.219
I am not Darcy! I am nothing!

24:16.220 --> 24:17.857
If you reached out your hand

24:17.858 --> 24:22.082
to touch me,
it would find only air.

24:24.183 --> 24:26.625
I'm sorry that I betrayed you.

24:28.714 --> 24:31.628
Forgive me.

24:31.629 --> 24:33.740
Old Tom.

24:33.741 --> 24:35.908
I can't do that.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.815
The living are so selfish.

24:39.816 --> 24:43.855
They can think of
nothing but themselves.

24:57.237 --> 24:58.967
Windsor Castle

24:58.968 --> 25:00.166
Qui mihi

25:00.234 --> 25:03.169
discipulus puer es...

25:03.203 --> 25:06.873
Qui mihi... dis...

25:08.909 --> 25:10.877
Edward,

25:12.681 --> 25:16.190
now listen closely.

25:16.191 --> 25:18.351
When you have a tutor,

25:18.385 --> 25:20.704
you have to learn
these things, Edward.

25:22.406 --> 25:24.290
Cupis atque...

25:24.291 --> 25:28.061
Doceri... - Cupis...

25:28.162 --> 25:32.231
Atque doc...

25:34.012 --> 25:35.745
You want to go and play?

25:35.746 --> 25:38.188
Yes, if it please you, sister.

25:44.503 --> 25:47.388
One day you will be a
great King, Edward.

25:47.389 --> 25:49.148
I know you will be.

25:49.149 --> 25:51.183
And very strong.

25:51.284 --> 25:54.346
But also fair and merciful.

25:54.894 --> 25:57.889
I want you to be a just ruler,

25:57.890 --> 26:01.097
and then indeed you
shall be a great King.

26:01.098 --> 26:04.313
Now-go along and play.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.882
Thank you, Elizabeth.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.804
And God bless you!

26:35.532 --> 26:37.328
Mr. Thomas Culpepper.

26:49.641 --> 26:52.944
- My Lady. Yes Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.429
Who is that?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.671
His name is Francis Dereham.

27:14.010 --> 27:16.100
But where did he come from?

27:16.234 --> 27:18.068
I knew him a long time ago.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.753
We both lived with
the Dowager Duchess.

27:20.754 --> 27:23.107
She wrote to me
recommending his services.

27:26.032 --> 27:27.742
How well did you know him?

27:29.825 --> 27:31.615
What are you trying to say?

27:32.284 --> 27:34.855
How well did you know him?

27:34.856 --> 27:37.373
We were children!

27:38.527 --> 27:40.986
You were never a child. Ever!

27:40.987 --> 27:43.030
You should know!

27:45.952 --> 27:47.469
Don't touch me!

27:47.470 --> 27:50.034
Don't ever touch me like that!

27:50.369 --> 27:52.467
Don't you know who I am?

27:52.468 --> 27:54.305
Or what I could do to you?

27:58.700 --> 28:02.806
You don't think you're
the only one, do you?

28:02.807 --> 28:06.340
I have a store of other
lovers beside you!

28:09.377 --> 28:12.879
Now get out! Get out!

28:18.906 --> 28:21.176
Your Majesty.

28:52.846 --> 28:54.224
Your Grace!

28:54.225 --> 28:56.213
Your Majesty-

28:56.782 --> 29:01.476
The devoted clergy of your
Majesty's Church of England,

29:01.477 --> 29:04.695
and the nobility and
loyal gentlemen of York,

29:04.696 --> 29:06.954
welcome you most heartily.

29:06.955 --> 29:10.470
In gratitude for your
Majesty's gracious pardon

29:10.471 --> 29:14.736
of our previous,
and grievous, sins,

29:14.737 --> 29:19.761
we hope your Majesty will
accept these purses of gold.

29:21.582 --> 29:23.616
Majesty.

29:27.422 --> 29:29.479
We thank your Grace.

29:30.194 --> 29:32.426
We thank York!

29:35.163 --> 29:37.330
Is everything prepared for
the King of Scotland's visit?

29:37.432 --> 29:38.900
Yes, your Majesty.

29:38.901 --> 29:40.572
King James is waiting
across the border.

29:40.573 --> 29:43.248
I have sent post horses and
messages of reassurance to him.

29:43.249 --> 29:46.192
Why? What is he afraid of?

29:46.193 --> 29:48.508
Does he think we're
going to kill him?

29:55.896 --> 29:57.684
And it's the same one?

29:57.785 --> 30:00.682
The one who visited her at night?
To whom she was promised?

30:00.683 --> 30:03.348
Yes, my Lady.
It's the same gentleman.

30:03.349 --> 30:05.601
Can I interest you in this?

30:05.602 --> 30:08.337
He has not changed much.

30:08.438 --> 30:11.806
Was he always so familiar?

30:11.807 --> 30:14.276
That is his way.

30:14.633 --> 30:17.446
Lord help us.

30:32.529 --> 30:34.630
More wine, my Lady?

30:34.698 --> 30:36.876
- No. Thank you.
- Oh, come on.

30:36.877 --> 30:39.368
Just a little? One more.

30:39.469 --> 30:42.138
I said no, Mr. Dereham.

30:45.081 --> 30:46.906
Thank you.

30:47.552 --> 30:49.435
Christ!

30:59.022 --> 31:00.505
I'm going to bed.

31:00.506 --> 31:03.145
- Your Majesty.
- Ladies?

31:05.204 --> 31:07.128
- Your Majesty.
- Come, ladies.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.851
Ladies.

31:16.019 --> 31:19.444
Mr. Dereham-I don't
know who you are,

31:19.445 --> 31:21.713
but you have no right
to be so familiar

31:21.714 --> 31:22.937
with the Queen of England!

31:22.938 --> 31:27.044
Or blaspheme in her presence.

31:27.597 --> 31:29.532
Mr. Fell,

31:29.666 --> 31:32.406
I know the Queen of England a
great deal better than you do.

31:32.407 --> 31:33.961
I don't think so.

31:33.962 --> 31:35.897
What do you mean"I don't think so"?

31:35.898 --> 31:37.740
Her name is Katherine Howard,

31:37.874 --> 31:39.909
and I've known her a long time.

31:40.043 --> 31:42.211
We used to be very close.

31:43.164 --> 31:45.969
Very close.

31:57.127 --> 31:59.161
Good night, sweet Edward.

32:05.335 --> 32:07.002
Lady Bryan!

32:07.070 --> 32:09.856
Lady Bryan! Come quickly!

32:12.436 --> 32:14.983
He has a fever. Feel his head.

32:18.538 --> 32:20.681
- Go fetch a physician. Run!
- Yes Madam. -

32:20.682 --> 32:23.185
Send a message to my Lord Hertford.
Yes my Lady.

32:25.919 --> 32:27.690
Poor lamb!

32:32.762 --> 32:36.440
Your behaviour is a
complete outrage.

32:36.441 --> 32:38.163
I want you to promise, Mr. Dereham,

32:38.164 --> 32:40.015
that from now on you will
not speak of the Queen

32:40.016 --> 32:42.616
in ways which offend
her proper dignity.

32:45.874 --> 32:48.552
Her dignity!

32:49.752 --> 32:52.560
I shall speak of her how I like.

32:52.694 --> 32:55.507
But you must not be so familiar.

32:55.508 --> 32:57.496
So familiar?

32:57.497 --> 32:59.467
Believe me, I am very
familiar with her.

32:59.468 --> 33:01.035
For God sake's, man!

33:01.102 --> 33:05.039
Your bragging and your
lies only harm yourself.

33:05.106 --> 33:07.286
My lies?

33:07.742 --> 33:11.091
You think that I am lying?
Let me tell you something, Mr. Fell.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.103
I know Katherine
Howard well enough,

33:14.104 --> 33:15.806
for I have had her by the cunt-

33:15.807 --> 33:17.769
My God, man!

33:17.770 --> 33:20.754
-and I would know it among a hundred others.

33:31.289 --> 33:34.124
I want you to give him a message.

33:35.765 --> 33:37.209
Who, your Majesty?

33:37.210 --> 33:38.925
You know who!

33:38.926 --> 33:40.994
Culpepper!

33:41.095 --> 33:45.465
Tell him... I must see him.
My Lady...

33:45.566 --> 33:48.049
Tell him there is a
way into my chamber.

33:48.050 --> 33:51.404
Tell him to come tomorrow,
when the King is asleep.

33:59.652 --> 34:00.857
What is it?

34:00.858 --> 34:03.650
Some kind of tertiary fever,
my Lord Hertford.

34:04.411 --> 34:06.050
Is he in danger?

34:07.755 --> 34:10.290
Is his life in danger? Answer me!

34:10.357 --> 34:13.126
If the fever persists,
then perhaps.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.330
We do have some remedies, my Lord.

34:20.724 --> 34:23.636
Shall we tell the King?

34:28.641 --> 34:30.036
No.

34:30.038 --> 34:33.313
If he felt obliged to curtail
his progress and hurry back,

34:33.380 --> 34:35.885
only to find the Prince
quite recovered...

34:38.328 --> 34:41.438
Apply your remedies.
For God's sake-

34:41.438 --> 34:43.869
and for the sake of
peace in this realm

34:43.870 --> 34:45.621
don't let him die.

34:54.310 --> 34:56.568
It's very interesting.

34:56.569 --> 34:58.371
It's his cousin, is it not?

35:01.372 --> 35:02.771
Kate.

35:04.108 --> 35:05.907
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

35:05.908 --> 35:07.540
Good afternoon, ladies.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.279
Your Majesty.

35:09.346 --> 35:11.499
I am sorry I have left
you so much alone.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.117
I have had much to do with
Council and other matters.

35:14.151 --> 35:16.344
Now, as you know, my nephew,
James, King of Scots,

35:16.345 --> 35:18.171
is due to visit here presently.

35:18.172 --> 35:20.307
We are to sign a peace treaty.

35:20.308 --> 35:23.445
And then we shall straight
back to London. I promise.

35:24.828 --> 35:26.893
I am at your Majesty's command.

35:27.981 --> 35:29.547
Always.

35:31.586 --> 35:35.171
Now tell me, is there any sign
that you may be with child?

35:43.961 --> 35:46.321
Gentlemen.

35:59.972 --> 36:02.732
I hear the King of
Scotland is coming!

36:02.833 --> 36:05.487
York will be full of drunken Scots

36:05.488 --> 36:08.204
with their brawny arms and togas.

36:08.305 --> 36:11.370
What a boon for you ladies!

36:16.254 --> 36:18.191
Sit down, Mr. Dereham.

36:18.192 --> 36:21.236
- Did you send the message?
- Och, aye! - Yes.

36:23.287 --> 36:25.039
Will he come?

36:26.525 --> 36:28.787
We knew a Scot, didn't we?

36:29.469 --> 36:31.196
What was his name?

36:31.197 --> 36:34.530
Do you remember? What was it?

36:34.910 --> 36:36.833
Manox.

36:38.894 --> 36:40.912
You remember Manox?

36:43.006 --> 36:44.832
Sir?

36:44.975 --> 36:47.449
Mr. Dereham!

36:48.345 --> 36:51.600
Joan, you must remember Manox?

36:52.195 --> 36:54.806
I think you and he...

36:56.971 --> 36:58.966
That's quite enough, Mr. Dereham.

37:00.758 --> 37:02.215
Ladies.

37:02.724 --> 37:04.448
Your Majesty.

37:04.995 --> 37:07.330
Gentlemen.

37:18.676 --> 37:20.232
How dare you!

37:20.233 --> 37:21.759
I shall tell the King.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.803
He ought to know how beggardly
his wife's servants treat her.

37:25.780 --> 37:27.290
Damn you, Fell!

37:27.291 --> 37:28.842
Damn you. - Mr. Dereham! Stop it!

37:28.843 --> 37:30.294
Stop it now!

37:33.056 --> 37:35.057
What's that, my Lord?

37:35.903 --> 37:38.414
Oh, nothing. A trifle.

37:38.415 --> 37:41.297
I daresay the Earl of
Surrey's "Trifles" Will

37:41.398 --> 37:44.021
someday be regarded as
some of our greatest poesy.

37:45.969 --> 37:48.871
Then I daresay your
Grace can read it.

37:50.808 --> 37:54.076
It's a translation, in sonnet form,

37:54.144 --> 37:56.879
of one of Martial's epigrams.

37:56.947 --> 38:00.249
That is, of course, the Roman
poet-but that doesn't matter.

38:00.317 --> 38:03.820
It's about the happy life.

38:04.601 --> 38:07.490
The Golden Mean.

38:12.429 --> 38:15.231
"The happy life be these, I find

38:15.332 --> 38:17.767
"The riches left, not got with pain

38:17.801 --> 38:21.270
"The fruitful ground;
the quiet mind

38:21.338 --> 38:26.142
"The equal friend;
no grudge nor strife

38:26.243 --> 38:28.478
"No charge of rule nor governance

38:28.612 --> 38:31.481
"Without disease,
the healthful life

38:31.582 --> 38:33.737
"Wisdom joined with simplicity

38:36.286 --> 38:38.561
"The night discharged of all care."

38:38.562 --> 38:40.399
The quiet mind.

38:42.326 --> 38:44.827
The night discharged of all care.

38:45.652 --> 38:47.662
Wisdom joined with simplicity.

38:49.633 --> 38:52.137
My God, how I wish
these things were true.

38:53.096 --> 38:55.516
Which of these, your Grace,
do you not have?

38:56.105 --> 38:57.808
All of them.

38:58.764 --> 39:00.787
Then you are like me.

39:00.788 --> 39:02.989
And like all the Romans.

39:03.057 --> 39:04.984
And all the Barbarians.

39:04.985 --> 39:07.458
And all the generations
before us...

39:08.967 --> 39:11.865
And all those yet to come.

39:11.966 --> 39:15.501
For who does not wish,
or rest, with all their heart

39:15.636 --> 39:19.172
for the quiet mind?

39:21.208 --> 39:24.477
Tell me a single soul
who has ever found it?

39:39.594 --> 39:41.488
Thomas.

39:44.498 --> 39:46.685
You've changed your mind, then?

39:46.686 --> 39:49.310
No, no.

39:49.311 --> 39:53.419
I love you. I told you.

39:53.420 --> 39:56.529
I long for nothing so
much as to see you.

39:57.673 --> 40:00.780
It makes my heart die
when I can't see you.

40:08.041 --> 40:10.001
I love you, too.

40:10.002 --> 40:11.925
But this Dereham-

40:11.926 --> 40:14.407
you have to get rid of him.

40:14.408 --> 40:16.961
Yes, I know. And I will.

40:16.962 --> 40:20.967
I promise. When we
get back to London.

40:24.748 --> 40:27.907
You're not still angry with me?

40:29.573 --> 40:32.177
Please don't be angry with me.

40:34.289 --> 40:37.083
I want to be at your commandment.

40:58.572 --> 41:00.991
You know what I want.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.775
Do it!

41:19.927 --> 41:21.871
Yes.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.170
That's it.

41:37.778 --> 41:40.613
Ah, yes. That's it, my sweet.

41:42.404 --> 41:45.102
My own sweet little fool.

42:19.110 --> 42:21.278
Your Majesty's gift to
the King of Scotland.

43:23.632 --> 43:26.758
Well! What do you
have to say? Speak!

43:26.759 --> 43:27.891
Majesty,

43:27.892 --> 43:29.504
the King of Scotland is not coming.

43:29.505 --> 43:31.561
He has gone back to Edinburgh.

43:31.629 --> 43:34.751
But worse! O that God
could forgive them!

43:34.752 --> 43:36.933
A Scottish army has ridden
over the border and is harrying

43:37.034 --> 43:40.263
our people, spoiling fields,
burning barns,

43:40.264 --> 43:42.991
and killing all those
who oppose them.

43:50.206 --> 43:52.126
Sir Thomas!

43:53.443 --> 43:54.805
Majesty.

43:54.806 --> 43:56.529
You will order our troops
on the border to retaliate,

43:56.530 --> 43:58.611
with spoils, burnings and killings.

43:58.612 --> 44:01.090
Three hurts to every one of ours.

44:01.091 --> 44:01.864
Do you understand?

44:01.865 --> 44:04.486
Yes, your Majesty. I am
straight away to that business.

44:42.025 --> 44:43.268
Majesty.

44:45.128 --> 44:49.355
What do you want? Speak or
I will cut out your tongue!

44:49.356 --> 44:51.501
I am to tell you that your son,

44:51.502 --> 44:55.523
Prince Edward,
is dangerously ill at Windsor.

45:21.831 --> 45:24.158
Your Majesty.

46:06.168 --> 46:09.432
Blessed Father, have mercy
on my brother Edward.

46:11.547 --> 46:14.549
Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris Filim.

47:20.249 --> 47:22.278
Father.

47:42.472 --> 47:45.373
My Lord, send for the
Bishop of London.

47:45.475 --> 47:48.310
Tell him to prepare a special
Mass in the Chapel Royal,

47:49.019 --> 47:52.959
to give thanks to God for
my son and for my wife.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.356
Yes, your Majesty.

48:16.661 --> 48:18.699
Dominus vobiscum.

48:18.700 --> 48:20.977
Et cum spiritu tuo.

48:25.281 --> 48:28.283
In the name of the Father, Son,

48:28.317 --> 48:30.986
and Holy Ghost.

48:31.120 --> 48:34.267
On this Day of All Saints,

48:34.268 --> 48:38.649
his Majesty wishes to
thank God for blessing him

48:38.650 --> 48:43.411
with so perfect a companion
as Queen Katherine.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.345
In his Majesty's own words:

48:46.346 --> 48:49.024
"I render thanks to Thee, O Lord,"

48:49.025 --> 48:51.377
that after so many
strange accidents

48:51.378 --> 48:53.414
that have befallen my marriages,

48:53.415 --> 48:56.958
Thou hast been pleased
to give me a wife

48:56.959 --> 49:00.741
so entirely conformed to
my inclinations as her

49:00.742 --> 49:02.998
"I now have."

49:03.319 --> 49:06.821
Gaudeamus omnes in Domino,

49:06.956 --> 49:09.824
diem festum celebrantes

49:09.859 --> 49:12.194
sub honore sanctorum omnium...
