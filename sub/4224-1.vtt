they've had messages coming up
from London to the brass.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.850

11:55.800 --> 11:58.724
And on that list was your name
and my name together.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.369
What kind of a list would
have the name of a communist

12:03.440 --> 12:05.408
and the name of a bookmaker
side by side?

12:10.160 --> 12:13.801

who give false hope to the poor.

something about him.

aren't you?

Nearly blew Ada's tits off.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.841

sideboard of the betting shop.

Scudboat and Lovelock
got back from Belfast last night.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.247
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.521
They were in a pub on the
Shankhill Road yesterday,

16:00.760 --> 16:03.604
and in that pub there was a copper.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.244
Handing out these.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.805
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

16:13.520 --> 16:17.650
They're recruiting Protestant Irishmen
to come over here as Special.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.280
- To do what?
- To clean up the city, Ada.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.206
He's the Chief Inspector.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.927
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.850
How do you know so bloody much?

16:29.360 --> 16:31.328
'Cause I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.041
And why didn't you tell me?

16:35.360 --> 16:36.361
I'm telling you.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.410
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

16:40.720 --> 16:43.166
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.925
And the Austin works, lately.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.729
Now the papers
are talking about sedition.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.521
And revolution.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.010
I reckon it's communists he's after.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.528
So this copper's gonna
leave us alone, right?

16:55.520 --> 16:58.569
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away from him.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.044
They say Catholic men who crossed him
used to disappear in the night.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.401
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.770
We bloody fought for the King.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.131
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.800
We're not scared of coppers.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.689
- He's right.
- If they come for us,

17:11.880 --> 17:13.369
we'll cut them a smile each.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.650
So, Arthur. Is that it?

17:16.960 --> 17:18.325

What do you think, Aunt Poll?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.650

17:22.319 --> 17:24.242
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

17:25.160 --> 17:26.161
No.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.365
Nothing that's women's business.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.642
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business

17:30.720 --> 17:32.370
while you boys were away at war.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.361
What's changed?

17:35.640 --> 17:36.641
We came back.

and your fornication will be revealed.

You cannot hide
from the Almighty himself.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.724
The Creator sees all.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.449
You cannot hide
from the true and living God.

Get off with ya!

19:11.320 --> 19:13.049
Some of them work at the BSA.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.328
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.529
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.682
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.361
Speak.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.563
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.564
It was meant to be routine.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.171
I had a buyer in London
for some motorcycles.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.722
I asked my men to steal me four bikes
with petrol engines.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.089
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.884
<i>There's a still inside the factory
makes tram line gin.</i>

20:03.840 --> 20:05.922
<i>They picked up the wrong fucking crate.</i>

20:07.480 --> 20:10.324
<i>The boys dropped it
at Charlie Strong's yard, as agreed.</i>

20:11.160 --> 20:15.370
<i>Must have taken it from the
proofing bay, instead of the export bay.</i>

20:20.880 --> 20:23.201
Holy sweet baby of Mary.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.251
Inside we found 25 Lewis machine guns,

20:27.160 --> 20:28.889
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

20:30.040 --> 20:34.090
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.321
Jesus, Tommy.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.881
All bound for Libya.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.650
Sitting right there
in Charlie Strong's yard.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.891
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.209
We put them in the stables
out of the rain.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.407
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.523
So that's why they sent a cop
from Belfast?

21:00.880 --> 21:02.291
Maybe, maybe not.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.282
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.930
You're not a fool.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.844
You sell those guns to anyone who has
use to them, you will hang.

21:12.920 --> 21:13.921
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

21:19.280 --> 21:20.805
Dump them somewhere
the police can find them.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.007
Maybe if they know they haven't fallen
into the wrong hands,

21:24.080 --> 21:25.809
this might blow over.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.327
- Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.
- No.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.447
He won't move contraband
under a full moon.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.723
Three days until it wanes.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.601
Then you'll do the right thing?

21:40.240 --> 21:41.685
You have your mother's common sense.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.721
But your father's devilment.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.804
I see them fighting.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.405
Let your mother win.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.009
I got tickets for the penny crush.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.850
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.322
I'm not in the mood
for the pictures tonight, Ada.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.290
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.687
Let's just walk a bit.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.487
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.444
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.008
They have friends everywhere,
we'd have to walk to London.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.204
I'm with you 'cause you're the
only man round here not scared of them.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.370
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.207
But you love me
more than you fear them, right?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.002
I don't want to be
always sneaking about.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.727
- Soon, we'll tell them.
- When?

23:19.280 --> 23:20.691
How did the family meeting go?

23:24.120 --> 23:25.121
UsuaL

23:25.720 --> 23:27.609
- There's a new copper coming.
- I heard.

23:27.880 --> 23:28.927
Mmm.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.048
And Tommy says
he's after the likes of you.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.651
So maybe you should burn your books
and stop making speeches.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.526
Oh, my Ada.

23:38.360 --> 23:42.001
The only princess of the Royal Family
of the kingdom of Small Heath.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.525
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

- Am I what?

- Galway.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.761

43:59.040 --> 44:00.644

If it is the IRA Fenians,

44:03.600 --> 44:05.841
I will find them and find the guns.

If it is the communists,
I will find them and find the guns.

44:09.560 --> 44:12.962
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.004
To me, there is no distinction
between any of the above.

They've shown their hand.

46:03.640 --> 46:04.687
Their hand?

46:04.760 --> 46:07.331
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.170
That's the way of the world.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.042

you're looking for, Tommy?

46:44.720 --> 46:46.085

46:47.880 --> 46:49.848
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

47:21.480 --> 47:22.845
Are you in position?

47:26.080 --> 47:27.206
I am, sir.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.240

47:31.560 --> 47:33.961
I'm quite shocked
at how these people live.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.441
Have you found anything out
that might help me?

47:39.640 --> 47:41.847
I interrogated the head
of the Peaky Blinders.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.486
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

47:58.640 --> 48:00.244
You sound fascinated.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.850
However, my opinion has not changed.

48:07.040 --> 48:08.804
The bookmaker gangs have other business

48:08.880 --> 48:11.326
and the communists
are too weak to have planned this.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.841
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

48:18.520 --> 48:22.844
You must not let your personal history
cloud yourjudgement.

48:27.640 --> 48:28.641
What history?

48:31.000 --> 48:35.005
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect myjudgement.

48:39.440 --> 48:40.965
If you see any guns,

48:42.080 --> 48:43.844
check the serial numbers
against that list.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.760
Your father...

48:50.240 --> 48:52.971
was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.247
I know he'd be very, very proud of you.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.403
Danny, as you know,
the man you killed was Italian.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.044
Those two men over there
are his brothers.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.809
If I let the Italians do this, Danny,

49:40.040 --> 49:42.327
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

49:43.520 --> 49:45.522
That's how those bastards do things.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.564
So, to stop a war breaking out
between us and the Italians,

49:52.880 --> 49:55.008
to save you from their barbarity,

49:58.440 --> 49:59.965
I said I would dispatch you myself.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.365
They're here to witness.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.287
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.563
I left my fucking brains in the mud.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.689

50:29.560 --> 50:33.246
You look out for my Rosie and my boys.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.765

50:43.320 --> 50:45.368

51:39.000 --> 51:41.002
Don't bury me anywhere there's mud.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.481
Okay?

51:43.440 --> 51:44.441
Promise me.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.089
Bury me on a hill,

51:49.360 --> 51:51.249
and tell Rosie where.

51:54.640 --> 51:56.404
You're a good man,

51:57.280 --> 51:59.123
and a good soldier.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.443
Yes, Sergeant Major.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.804
In the bleak mid-winter...

53:17.560 --> 53:19.608

53:22.960 --> 53:24.371
It bloody won.

53:24.720 --> 53:27.121
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

53:28.720 --> 53:31.041
Yeah. It won.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.005
And word will spread.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.484
So the next time we do the powder trick,

53:36.560 --> 53:39.689
it won't be just a garrison
that'll bet on the horse.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.569
It'll be the whole of Small Heath.

53:41.640 --> 53:43.165
And you know what?

53:44.040 --> 53:45.804
The horse will win again.

53:45.880 --> 53:49.407
And the third time we do it we'll have
the whole of Birmingham betting on it.

53:49.480 --> 53:52.962

53:53.040 --> 53:54.690

53:55.400 --> 53:57.209
when we are ready...

53:57.280 --> 53:58.645
the horse will lose.

If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

54:55.920 --> 54:57.684
Tommy wanted you to think it was real.

hurts pretty bad.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.646
