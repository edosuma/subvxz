00:01.568 --> 00:02.569
&gt;&gt;<i> TRUE JACKSON, VP</i>

00:02.635 --> 00:03.236
WAS FILMED IN FRONT

00:03.303 --> 00:06.406
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.774
&gt;&gt; SAY, TRUE,

00:07.841 --> 00:12.245
HOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

00:12.312 --> 00:13.213
&gt;&gt; IT'S SO HOT,

00:13.279 --> 00:13.713
THE THERMOMETER

00:13.780 --> 00:14.948
IN FRONT OF MY SCHOOL EXPLODED.

00:15.014 --> 00:16.082
THEN THE THERMOMETER-SHAPED SIGN

00:16.149 --> 00:17.117
FOR THE CANNED FOOD DRIVE

00:17.183 --> 00:17.817
EXPLODED.

00:17.884 --> 00:18.985
&gt;&gt; WELL, SOMETHING BETTER

00:19.052 --> 00:20.353
BE DONE SOON.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.087
I'M HAVING MY PICTURE

00:21.154 --> 00:22.322
TAKEN TODAY AND THE HEAT

00:22.389 --> 00:24.824
MAKES MY HAIR FRIZZY.

00:24.891 --> 00:25.792
&gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.393
&gt;&gt; SAY, MAX--

00:26.459 --> 00:27.193
&gt;&gt; HOLD THAT THOUGHT, AMANDA.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.194
BEFORE WE BEGIN,

00:28.261 --> 00:28.795
I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT

00:28.862 --> 00:29.729
CRYSTAL CLEAR

00:29.796 --> 00:30.864
THAT I'LL FIRE ANYONE

00:30.930 --> 00:31.931
WHO USES THE PHRASE,

00:31.998 --> 00:33.867
"HOT ENOUGH FOR YA?"

00:33.933 --> 00:35.835
NOW, WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?

00:35.902 --> 00:39.706
&gt;&gt; UM, CATCH THE BIG GAME?

00:39.773 --> 00:40.740
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

00:40.807 --> 00:41.541
SO I'D APPRECIATE IT

00:41.608 --> 00:42.742
IF WE COULD STAY FOCUSED.

00:42.809 --> 00:43.643
[ELECTRIC FAN SOUND]

00:43.710 --> 00:46.379
&gt;&gt; KOPELMAN!

00:46.446 --> 00:48.348
THAT'S INCREDIBLY DISTRACTING.

00:48.415 --> 00:51.384
GIVE IT TO ME.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.820
OH, SAY, THAT'S NICE.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.155
&gt;&gt; MAX, IF I MAY,

00:55.221 --> 00:56.990
WHY IS THE OFFICE SO HOT?

00:57.056 --> 00:57.624
&gt;&gt; MAINTENANCE SAID

00:57.690 --> 00:58.858
THE BUILDING AIR CONDITIONING

00:58.925 --> 01:00.660
BLEW OUT AND THEY HAVE NO CLUE

01:00.727 --> 01:01.261
HOW IT HAPPENED.

01:01.327 --> 01:05.098
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA?

01:05.165 --> 01:05.665
&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU MAKE

01:05.732 --> 01:06.466
AN ICE SKATING RINK?

01:06.533 --> 01:07.333
&gt;&gt; POURED WATER ALL OVER

01:07.400 --> 01:08.001
TRUE'S FLOOR

01:08.067 --> 01:09.736
AND CRANKED THE A.C.,

01:09.803 --> 01:10.537
GOOD IDEA, HUH?

01:10.603 --> 01:11.404
&gt;&gt; PRETTY GOOD,

01:11.471 --> 01:13.173
UNLESS IT BLOWS OUT THE SYSTEM.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.140
&gt;&gt; YEAH, RIGHT.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.208
IT'S REALLY GONNA BLOW OUT THE--

01:15.275 --> 01:17.243
[EXPLOSION]

01:17.310 --> 01:17.877
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY.

01:17.944 --> 01:18.912
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT LAST PART

01:18.978 --> 01:19.379
OVER THE SOUND

01:19.446 --> 01:21.514
OF THE THERMOSTAT EXPLODING.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.081
&gt;&gt; QUICK, LET'S PLAY

01:22.148 --> 01:25.151
BEFORE THE ICE MELTS.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.686
&gt;&gt; RYAN!

01:26.753 --> 01:27.921
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:27.987 --> 01:28.421
&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE

01:28.488 --> 01:29.355
YOU POURED WATER ON MY FLOOR

01:29.422 --> 01:30.089
AND CRANKED THE A.C.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.292
TO MAKE AN ICE SKATING RINK.

01:32.358 --> 01:32.992
&gt;&gt; THEN IT'S EXACTLY

01:33.059 --> 01:38.998
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:39.065 --> 01:39.933
&gt;&gt; NO ONE HAS ANY IDEA

01:39.999 --> 01:41.835
WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR SYSTEM?

01:41.901 --> 01:43.002
&gt;&gt; PROBABLY FAULTY WIRING.

01:43.069 --> 01:43.636
YOU KNOW, MY UNCLE, TROY

01:43.703 --> 01:45.405
ONCE USED A BUDGET ELECTRICIAN.

01:45.472 --> 01:46.739
HE SAVED A BUNCH OF MONEY,

01:46.806 --> 01:47.841
BUT THE FIRST TIME

01:47.907 --> 01:49.309
HE FLUSHED HIS TOILET,

01:49.375 --> 01:51.978
HE GOT ELECTROCUTED.

01:52.045 --> 01:52.879
&gt;&gt; IS HE ALL RIGHT?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.247
&gt;&gt; OH YEAH, HE'S FINE.

01:54.314 --> 01:57.150
HE JUST SMELLS LIKE BACON.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.084
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY'D BETTER FIX

01:58.151 --> 01:59.953
THE AIR CONDITIONING SOON.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.087
THE OPTIMUM HUMIDITY LEVEL

02:01.154 --> 02:03.122
FOR MY HAIR IS 42%.

02:03.189 --> 02:03.923
ANYTHING ABOVE THAT,

02:03.990 --> 02:04.757
IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE A CAT

02:04.824 --> 02:06.493
ON MY HEAD.

02:06.559 --> 02:07.827
&gt;&gt; LIKE CONNIE CATHEAD.

02:09.829 --> 02:10.563
BEST FRIEND.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.665

02:12.732 --> 02:13.666
SHE HATES HER.

02:13.733 --> 02:14.634
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE, I REALIZE

02:14.701 --> 02:15.535
IT'S HOTTER THAN THE SURFACE

02:15.602 --> 02:16.135
OF THE SUN IN HERE,

02:16.202 --> 02:17.871
BUT LET'S TRY TO STAY FOCUSED.

02:17.937 --> 02:18.505
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:18.571 --> 02:19.672
WHAT ARE WE WORKING ON?

02:19.739 --> 02:20.874
&gt;&gt; WINTER COATS.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.408
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID WHAT NOW?

02:22.475 --> 02:23.610
&gt;&gt; WE ALWAYS DESIGN OUR LINES

02:23.676 --> 02:24.377
SIX MONTHS OUT.

02:24.444 --> 02:25.745
JUST TRY TO IMAGINE

02:25.812 --> 02:26.846
IT'S NOT HOT.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.081
INSTEAD, PRETEND

02:28.147 --> 02:29.616
THERE'S A NICE, COOL BREEZE

02:29.682 --> 02:31.851
ON YOUR FACE.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S EASY TO SAY

02:32.619 --> 02:33.419
WHEN YOU HAVE A NICE,

02:33.486 --> 02:35.154

02:44.664 --> 02:46.466
BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER,

04:24.764 --> 04:25.398
&gt;&gt; LOOK, I KNOW I OWE YOU

04:25.465 --> 04:26.332
FOR COVERING FOR ME,

04:26.399 --> 04:28.401
BUT THIS COAT IS REALLY HOT.

04:28.468 --> 04:29.369
&gt;&gt; AS SOON AS I FINISH,

04:29.435 --> 04:31.437
YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.972

04:33.039 --> 04:33.840
&gt;&gt; HMM.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.541

04:36.075 --> 04:36.676

ANYTHING CONSTRUCTIVE,

04:37.777 --> 04:39.512
PLEASE JUST STAND THERE.

04:39.579 --> 04:46.452
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.454
&gt;&gt; OKAY, LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

04:48.521 --> 04:49.922
&gt;&gt; WOW, IT'S PRETTY HOT.

04:49.989 --> 04:50.823
I BET EVERYONE IN THE CITY

IS MOVING AT HALF SPEED TODAY.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.160
&gt;&gt; HEY, HEY, HEY--

04:54.227 --> 04:55.261
MORNING LASERBEAM.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.262

04:56.329 --> 04:56.896
&gt;&gt; JUST ENJOYING

04:56.963 --> 04:58.431
THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.399
&gt;&gt; BEAUTIFUL DAY?

04:59.465 --> 04:59.966
ON THE WAY TO WORK,

05:00.033 --> 05:02.035
I WATCHED A TRUCK MELT.

05:02.101 --> 05:02.902
&gt;&gt; THAT LOOKS GOOD.

05:02.969 --> 05:03.569
DID YOU GET IT DOWNSTAIRS

05:03.636 --> 05:04.137
AT HAPPY BERRY?

05:04.203 --> 05:04.704
&gt;&gt; OH, HEAVENS, NO,

05:04.771 --> 05:06.072
THAT PLACE IS A CESSPOOL.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.273
THIS IS FROM MY FAVORITE

05:07.340 --> 05:08.441
ICE CREAM STORE IN THE WORLD,

05:08.508 --> 05:09.842
GIAPELLO'S.

05:09.909 --> 05:10.476
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD

05:10.543 --> 05:11.177
OF GIAPELLO'S.

05:11.244 --> 05:11.711
&gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE

05:11.778 --> 05:12.378
THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS

05:12.445 --> 05:13.913
18 YEARS AGO.

05:13.980 --> 05:14.447
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING

05:14.514 --> 05:15.014
YOU'VE BEEN LICKING

05:15.081 --> 05:17.150
THE SAME SCOOP FOR 18 YEARS?

05:17.216 --> 05:18.151
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.519
I COULDN'T IMAGINE LIFE

05:19.585 --> 05:20.153
WITHOUT GIAPELLO'S.

05:20.219 --> 05:20.653
SO WHEN I HEARD

05:20.720 --> 05:21.688
THEY WERE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS,

05:21.754 --> 05:23.122
I BOUGHT 100 GALLONS

05:23.189 --> 05:23.656
OF THEIR FAMOUS

05:23.723 --> 05:25.358
PISTACHIO COOKIE ICE CREAM.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.392
&gt;&gt; A HUNDRED GALLONS?

05:26.459 --> 05:27.960
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM, I'VE RATIONED IT OUT

05:28.027 --> 05:28.494
SO THAT I CAN HAVE

05:28.561 --> 05:29.362
TWO SCOOPS A DAY

05:29.429 --> 05:30.730
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

05:30.797 --> 05:32.598
WHICH IS WHY I WILL DIE

05:32.665 --> 05:34.834
ON MY 75th BIRTHDAY.

05:34.901 --> 05:35.468
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT

05:35.535 --> 05:36.002
ABOUT JUST HAVING

05:36.069 --> 05:36.569
ONE SCOOP A DAY,

05:36.636 --> 05:38.604
SO YOU CAN LIVE TO BE 150?

05:38.671 --> 05:39.906
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ABSURD.

05:39.972 --> 05:50.850
150, HUH.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.118
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR WORKING IN HERE.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.653
IT'S MUCH MORE PLEASANT.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.854
&gt;&gt; DON'T MOVE YOUR ARMS.

05:54.921 --> 05:55.888
THE SLEEVES AREN'T ATTACHED YET.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.890
&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY, CALM DOWN.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.559
NO REASON TO GET--DOOR!

05:59.625 --> 06:00.860
&gt;&gt; DOOR!

06:00.927 --> 06:02.562
&gt;&gt; AHH, THAT'S THE STUFF.

06:02.628 --> 06:03.129
HOW MUCH LONGER?

06:03.196 --> 06:03.663
&gt;&gt; I NEED TO REDO

06:03.730 --> 06:04.430
THE CROSS-STITCH ON THE HEM,

06:04.497 --> 06:05.798
SO ABOUT THREE HOURS.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.532
&gt;&gt; THREE HOURS?

06:06.599 --> 06:06.899
&gt;&gt; DOOR.

06:06.966 --> 06:08.334
&gt;&gt; DOOR!

06:08.401 --> 06:08.735
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.503
&gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.270
&gt;&gt; HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING

06:11.337 --> 06:11.704
IN HERE?

06:11.771 --> 06:12.238
&gt;&gt; JUST FINISHING

06:12.305 --> 06:13.039
MY WINTER COAT DESIGN.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.340
I HOPE MR. MADIGAN LIKES IT.

06:14.407 --> 06:14.907
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU KIDDING?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.342
UNCLE MAX IS GONNA LOVE IT.

06:16.409 --> 06:16.943
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK?

06:17.009 --> 06:17.610
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE DESIGNED

06:17.677 --> 06:18.878
PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME COAT

06:18.945 --> 06:19.612
LAST YEAR.

06:19.679 --> 06:20.613
&gt;&gt; OH, NO.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.148
NOW, I HAVE TO START OVER.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.750
&gt;&gt; START OVER?

06:23.816 --> 06:24.851
DOOR!

06:24.917 --> 06:26.252
DOOR!

06:26.319 --> 06:28.955
DOOR.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.323
&gt;&gt; DID SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING?

06:30.389 --> 06:31.090
&gt;&gt; I'M NEVER GONNA COME UP

06:31.157 --> 06:32.358
WITH AN ORIGINAL DESIGN,

06:32.425 --> 06:32.959
LET ALONE FINISH,

06:33.025 --> 06:33.993
IF RYAN KEEPS PASSING OUT

06:34.060 --> 06:35.428
FROM THE HEAT.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.028
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU WORK

06:36.095 --> 06:36.829
IN THE ARCTIC ROOM?

06:36.896 --> 06:37.830
IT'S FREEZING IN THERE.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.631
&gt;&gt; THE ARCTIC ROOM?

06:38.698 --> 06:39.799
&gt;&gt; YEAH, UP ON 38,

06:39.866 --> 06:41.267
IT'S IN THE TESTING SUITES.

06:41.334 --> 06:41.968
IT'S WHERE THEY TEST CLOTHES

06:42.034 --> 06:44.070
IN EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.104
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU GET US IN?

06:45.171 --> 06:45.938
&gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.540
AS AN OFFICER OF THE MAIL ROOM,

06:47.607 --> 06:50.743
I GOT KEYS TO EVERY DOOR.

06:50.810 --> 06:57.183
&gt;&gt; DOOR.

06:57.250 --> 06:57.717
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE

06:57.784 --> 06:59.418
I'VE NEVER BEEN UP HERE BEFORE.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.052
&gt;&gt; HEY, CHECK IT OUT,

07:00.119 --> 07:01.587
THE DESSERT ROOM.

07:01.654 --> 07:02.889
I HOPE THEY HAVE PARFAITS.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.992
I LOVE PARFAITS.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.027
&gt;&gt; DESSERT HAS TWO S's.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.329
THAT SAYS DESERT ROOM.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.732
&gt;&gt; I KNEW THAT.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.468
MAN, I COULD GO FOR A PARFAIT.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.003
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S IN HERE?

07:17.069 --> 07:17.703
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WATER TANK

07:17.770 --> 07:20.306
WHERE THEY TEST THE SWIMSUITS.

07:20.373 --> 07:20.907
&gt;&gt; IS THAT KOPELMAN

07:20.973 --> 07:22.008
LYING ON A RAFT?

07:22.074 --> 07:22.942
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE COMES UP HERE

07:23.009 --> 07:24.310
EVERY DAY TO CHILL OUT.

07:24.377 --> 07:24.877
&gt;&gt; WHY'S HE WEARING

07:24.944 --> 07:26.546
A BLACK SWEATER?

07:26.612 --> 07:27.046
WAIT A MINUTE,

07:27.113 --> 07:28.581
THAT'S NOT A SWEATER.

07:28.648 --> 07:32.285
HE'S NOT EVEN WEARING A SHIRT.

07:32.351 --> 07:35.254
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ONE HAIRY DUDE.

07:35.321 --> 07:35.888
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE INCLEMENT

07:35.955 --> 07:36.789
WEATHER CHAMBER.

07:36.856 --> 07:37.723
THIS CONTROL PANEL

07:37.790 --> 07:39.892
CAN MAKE IT RAIN, SLEET OR SNOW.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.660
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LIKE MY UNCLE TROY'S

07:40.726 --> 07:42.028
LIVING ROOM.

07:42.094 --> 07:42.495
DID I MENTION

07:42.562 --> 07:44.797
HE DIDN'T HAVE A ROOF?

07:44.864 --> 07:49.468
&gt;&gt; AND HERE'S THE ARCTIC ROOM.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.938
&gt;&gt; PHEW, THIS IS GREAT.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.739
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.574
&gt;&gt; JUST LIKE UNCLE TROY'S

07:54.640 --> 07:56.209
DURING IN THE WINTER.

07:56.275 --> 07:56.742
&gt;&gt; HEY, CHECK OUT

07:56.809 --> 07:58.544
THESE GIANT ICE CUBES.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.145
I'LL BET IF GODZILLA

07:59.212 --> 07:59.612
WERE DRINKING

07:59.679 --> 08:00.646
A GLASS OF LEMONADE,

08:00.713 --> 08:02.615
THIS IS WHERE HE'D GET HIS ICE.

08:02.682 --> 08:03.015
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

08:03.082 --> 08:03.983
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?

08:04.050 --> 08:04.650
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

08:04.717 --> 08:05.484
I FIND I THINK A LOT ABOUT

08:05.551 --> 08:07.620
GODZILLA THESE DAYS.

08:07.687 --> 08:08.387
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE GO TO MY OFFICE

08:08.454 --> 08:08.988
AND GET THE MATERIALS,

08:09.055 --> 08:09.655
SO WE CAN WORK UP HERE.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.924
&gt;&gt; GOOD IDEA.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.595
&gt;&gt; RYAN, YOU COMING?

08:15.661 --> 08:18.831
&gt;&gt; RYAN, DID YOU LICK THAT PIPE?

08:18.898 --> 08:25.571
&gt;&gt; UH-UH.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.240
&gt;&gt; MAD STYLE, PLEASE HOLD.

08:27.306 --> 08:28.975
MAD STYLE, PLEASE HOLD.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.710
MAD STYLE, PLEASE HOLD.

08:30.776 --> 08:31.510
HI, TRUE, HEY, LULU.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.745
&gt;&gt; HEY, BUSY, HUH?

08:32.812 --> 08:34.013
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S BEEN DEAD ALL DAY.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.014
MUST BE THE HEAT.

08:35.081 --> 08:35.581
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU JUST TOOK

08:35.648 --> 08:36.515
A BUNCH OF CALLS.

08:36.582 --> 08:37.083
&gt;&gt; I WAS PRACTICING.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.452
YOU KNOW, WORKING ON MY CRAFT.

08:39.518 --> 08:40.553
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

08:40.620 --> 08:41.254
&gt;&gt; OH, THEY WENT HOME EARLY,

08:41.320 --> 08:42.288
'CAUSE THE A.C. IS OUT,

08:42.355 --> 08:43.022
BUT I STAYED BECAUSE THE HEAT

08:43.089 --> 08:45.458
REALLY DOESN'T AFFECT ME.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.860
&gt;&gt; YES, WE CAN TELL.

08:47.927 --> 08:48.561
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BLAME EVERYONE

08:48.628 --> 08:49.328
FOR LEAVING.

08:49.395 --> 08:49.862
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE

08:49.929 --> 08:50.696
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO WORK ON,

08:50.763 --> 08:52.632
ONLY A CRAZY PERSON WOULD STAY.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.568
&gt;&gt; TRUE!

08:55.635 --> 08:56.636
&gt;&gt; AMANDA,

08:56.702 --> 08:58.070
WHAT'S WITH YOUR HAIR?

08:58.137 --> 09:00.106
&gt;&gt; THE HUMIDITY IS AT 74%.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.074
I LOOK LIKE CONNIE CATHEAD.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.277
&gt;&gt; PLEASE DON'T MENTION HER.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.311
&gt;&gt; I'M HAVING MY PICTURE

09:05.378 --> 09:06.379
TAKEN IN TWO HOURS.

09:06.445 --> 09:07.480
YOU'D BETTER DO SOMETHING

09:07.546 --> 09:08.748
ABOUT THIS HEAT.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.082
&gt;&gt; WHY US?

09:10.149 --> 09:10.683
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE

09:10.750 --> 09:11.918
WE CONTROL THE WEATHER.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.719
WE'RE NOT WEATHERMEN.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.021
&gt;&gt; IF MY HUNCH IS CORRECT,

09:15.087 --> 09:16.289
YOU KIDS HAD SOMETHING TO DO

09:16.355 --> 09:16.889
WITH THIS MESS.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.025
&gt;&gt; AUGH, YOU KNOW,

09:19.091 --> 09:19.926
I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED

09:19.992 --> 09:21.193
OF YOU ALWAYS IMPLYING

09:21.260 --> 09:26.098
KIDS ARE IRRESPONSIBLE.

09:26.165 --> 09:34.573
&gt;&gt; SNOWBALL FIGHT!

09:34.640 --> 09:36.876
&gt;&gt; RYAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:36.943 --> 09:38.544
&gt;&gt; HAVING A SNOWBALL FIGHT.

09:38.611 --> 09:39.211
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE ALL THESE KIDS

09:39.278 --> 09:40.813
FROM SCHOOL DOING HERE?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.381
&gt;&gt; HAVING A SNOWBALL FIGHT.

09:42.448 --> 09:43.115
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU HAVE TO TELL

09:43.182 --> 09:44.150
EVERYONE TO LEAVE.

09:44.216 --> 09:44.684
TRUE HAS TO WORK

09:44.750 --> 09:45.384
ON HER WINTER COAT DESIGN

09:45.451 --> 09:46.118
IN HERE.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.320
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T THROW THESE KIDS OUT.

09:47.386 --> 09:48.154
&gt;&gt; YES, YOU CAN.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.021
&gt;&gt; NO, I CAN'T.

09:49.088 --> 09:49.889
I CHARGED THEM $10 EACH

09:49.956 --> 09:50.823
FOR THE WHOLE DAY.

09:50.890 --> 09:53.759
HEY GUY, 10 BUCKS.

09:53.826 --> 09:54.694
&gt;&gt; RYAN, YOU DO REALIZE,

09:54.760 --> 09:55.761
THE MORE KIDS SHOW UP,

09:55.828 --> 09:56.562
THE WARMER IT'S GONNA GET

09:56.629 --> 09:57.129
IN HERE.

09:57.196 --> 09:57.930
&gt;&gt; I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

09:57.997 --> 09:58.464
FOR EVERY NEW KID,

09:58.531 --> 09:59.932
I LOWER THE THERMOSTAT A LITTLE.

09:59.999 --> 10:00.933
&gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT HOW YOU BLEW OUT

10:01.000 --> 10:02.368
THE A.C. IN THE OFFICES?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.269
&gt;&gt; THAT'S DIFFERENT.

10:03.336 --> 10:03.970
THIS ROOM IS POWERED BY

10:04.036 --> 10:05.438
A GALVESTON GENERATOR.

10:05.504 --> 10:10.409
[SPARKS AND SMOKE]

10:10.476 --> 10:12.144
&gt;&gt; UH-OH.

10:12.211 --> 10:12.878
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHO WOULD NOT HAVE

10:12.945 --> 10:15.581
LIKED THAT EXPLOSION ONE BIT?

10:15.648 --> 10:17.550
GODZILLA.

10:17.616 --> 10:18.317
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.519
COULD THIS DAY GET ANY WORSE?

10:20.586 --> 10:21.721
&gt;&gt; WOULD THIS BE A BAD TIME

10:21.787 --> 10:22.722
TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS WHERE

10:22.788 --> 10:23.689
MR. MADIGAN KEEPS

10:23.756 --> 10:26.425
HIS FAVORITE ICE CREAM?

10:26.492 --> 10:35.201
&gt;&gt; YES, NOW WOULD BE A BAD TIME.

10:35.267 --> 10:35.768
&gt;&gt; I GOT YOUR TEXT.

10:35.835 --> 10:39.005
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

10:39.071 --> 10:39.972
&gt;&gt; OH.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.040
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

10:41.107 --> 10:42.041
MR. MADIGAN'S BEEN SAVING

10:42.108 --> 10:44.176
THIS STUFF FOR 18 YEARS.

10:44.243 --> 10:44.810
&gt;&gt; WE COULD REPLACE IT

10:44.877 --> 10:45.845
WITH ANOTHER BRAND.

10:45.911 --> 10:46.379
&gt;&gt; NO WAY.

10:46.445 --> 10:46.812
UNCLE MAX

10:46.879 --> 10:48.547
HAS WORLD-CLASS TASTE BUDS.

10:48.614 --> 10:49.115
&gt;&gt; YOU REALLY THINK

10:49.181 --> 10:49.882
HE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE

10:49.949 --> 10:51.417
FROM ONE ICE CREAM TO ANOTHER?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.284
&gt;&gt; ONE TIME, KOPELMAN REPLACED

10:52.351 --> 10:53.519
THE COFFEE IN THE BREAK ROOM

10:53.586 --> 10:54.186
WITH THE COFFEE HE BROUGHT

10:54.253 --> 11:08.367
BACK FROM HIS TRIP TO MAUI.

11:08.434 --> 11:08.934
&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN'S

11:09.001 --> 11:10.503
GONNA BE REALLY MAD.

11:10.569 --> 11:11.103
&gt;&gt; GOOD NEWS IS I KNOW

11:11.170 --> 11:12.271
WHAT WILL CALM HIM DOWN.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.806
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

11:13.873 --> 11:14.273
&gt;&gt; IT'S MELTED

11:14.340 --> 11:16.876
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.411
&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.

11:18.477 --> 11:18.911
IF GIAPELLO'S

11:18.978 --> 11:20.413
PISTACHIO COOKIE ICE CREAM

11:20.479 --> 11:21.080
IS THE ONLY THING

11:21.147 --> 11:22.348
THAT CAN FIX THIS,

11:22.415 --> 11:22.982
LET'S MAKE MORE

11:23.049 --> 11:23.883
GIAPELLO'S PISTACHIO

11:23.949 --> 11:25.017
COOKIE ICE CREAM.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.152
&gt;&gt; HOW?

11:26.218 --> 11:27.286
&gt;&gt; WE TRACK DOWN MR. GIAPELLO

11:27.353 --> 11:27.887
AND ASK HIM TO GIVE US

11:27.953 --> 11:29.088
THE RECIPE.

11:29.155 --> 11:29.989
&gt;&gt; BUT HOW DO WE FIND HIM?

11:30.056 --> 11:31.123
MR. MADIGAN IS THE ONLY ONE

11:31.190 --> 11:32.858
OF US THAT EVEN KNOWS WHO HE IS.

11:32.925 --> 11:33.426
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU THINKING

11:33.492 --> 11:34.226
WHAT I'M THINKING?

11:34.293 --> 11:34.794
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO LICK

11:34.860 --> 11:35.828
THE ICE CREAM OFF THE FLOOR,

11:35.895 --> 11:36.362
BUT YOU'RE AFRAID

11:36.429 --> 11:37.296
OF BEING JUDGED HARSHLY

11:37.363 --> 11:39.231
BY YOUR PEERS?

11:39.298 --> 11:42.101
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

11:42.168 --> 11:42.601
&gt;&gt; NEVER MIND.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.470
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.204
&gt;&gt; THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB

11:45.271 --> 11:46.572
FOR DR. ESPIONAGE

11:46.639 --> 11:48.340
AND HIS GOOFY SIDEKICK.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.410
&gt;&gt; I'M DR. ESPIONAGE, RIGHT?

11:51.477 --> 12:02.388
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.522
&gt;&gt; HI, UNCLE MAX.

12:03.589 --> 12:04.623
&gt;&gt; HELLO, BOYS.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.724
&gt;&gt; HOT ENOUGH FOR YA?

12:05.791 --> 12:07.460
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE FIRED.

12:07.526 --> 12:08.127
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T REALLY

12:08.194 --> 12:08.561
WORK HERE.

12:08.627 --> 12:09.295
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU LIKE TO?

12:09.361 --> 12:10.162
&gt;&gt; SURE.

12:10.229 --> 12:10.763
&gt;&gt; THEN YOU'RE HIRED.

12:10.830 --> 12:11.630
WELCOME ABOARD.

12:11.697 --> 12:12.998
&gt;&gt; THANKS, MR. MADIGAN.

12:13.065 --> 12:13.799
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:13.866 --> 12:14.500
&gt;&gt; NOTHING, YOU'RE FIRED.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.635
NOW, GET OUT.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.671
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, JIMMY?

12:18.737 --> 12:19.171
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU

12:19.238 --> 12:20.172
LET ME ASK QUESTIONS?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.073
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.007
&gt;&gt; JUST TAKING A LITTLE SURVEY

12:22.074 --> 12:22.942
FOR THE MAIL ROOM.

12:23.008 --> 12:23.843
YOUR ANSWERS COULD REALLY

12:23.909 --> 12:24.477
HELP US IMPROVE

12:24.543 --> 12:25.311
OUR OVERALL PERFORMANCE.

12:25.377 --> 12:26.245
&gt;&gt; OH, VERY WELL.

12:26.312 --> 12:26.745
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU HAPPY

12:26.812 --> 12:27.379
WITH YOUR MAIL DELIVERY?

12:27.446 --> 12:28.080
&gt;&gt; YES.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.014
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

12:29.081 --> 12:29.515
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU HAPPY

12:29.582 --> 12:30.316
WITH YOUR MAIL PICKUP?

12:30.382 --> 12:30.816
&gt;&gt; YES.

12:30.883 --> 12:31.784
&gt;&gt; SUPER.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.018
OKAY, PLEASE WRITE DOWN

12:33.085 --> 12:33.886
THE MOST RECENT ADDRESS

12:33.953 --> 12:34.653
FOR MR. FRANK GIAPELLO

12:34.720 --> 12:36.622
ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHEET.

12:36.689 --> 12:49.735
&gt;&gt; VERY UNUSUAL SURVEY.

12:49.802 --> 12:52.505
&gt;&gt; GET OFF MY LAWN!

12:52.571 --> 12:54.807
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE A LAWN.

12:54.874 --> 12:55.407
&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT,

12:55.474 --> 12:58.844
MY GARDENER'S FIRED.

12:58.911 --> 12:59.645
&gt;&gt; MR. GIAPELLO,

12:59.712 --> 13:00.713
MY NAME'S TRUE JACKSON.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.047
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY BOSS,

13:02.114 --> 13:03.182
MAX MADIGAN.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.251
&gt;&gt; LITTLE MAXIE MADIGAN?

13:05.317 --> 13:06.118
&gt;&gt; YOU REMEMBER HIM?

13:06.185 --> 13:07.186
&gt;&gt; SURE, HE ALWAYS WORE

13:07.253 --> 13:09.188
SHORT STRIPED PANTS AND A CAP

13:09.255 --> 13:11.657
WITH A PROPELLER ON IT.

13:11.724 --> 13:12.391
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK HE'S TALKING

13:12.458 --> 13:13.425
ABOUT THE SAME PERSON.

13:13.492 --> 13:14.593
&gt;&gt; LOVED PISTACHIO

13:14.660 --> 13:16.662
COOKIE ICE CREAM.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.663
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HIM.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.864
&gt;&gt; I NEVER FORGET A CUSTOMER

13:18.931 --> 13:21.233
AND THEIR FAVORITE ICE CREAM.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.069
TOMMY CALDWELL: VANILLA.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.739
BRIAN BANKS: VANILLA.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.608
JESS BROWN: VANILLA.

13:29.675 --> 13:30.209
&gt;&gt; IT SORTA SEEMS LIKE

13:30.276 --> 13:31.577
YOU'RE JUST SAYING RANDOM NAMES

13:31.644 --> 13:38.050
AND THEN THE WORD VANILLA.

13:38.117 --> 13:38.584
&gt;&gt; MR. GIAPELLO,

13:38.651 --> 13:39.351
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING US

13:39.418 --> 13:40.386
THE RECIPE TO YOUR PISTACHIO

13:40.452 --> 13:41.654
COOKIE ICE CREAM?

13:41.720 --> 13:43.189
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T DO THAT.

13:43.255 --> 13:43.756
IF I GIVE IT TO YOU,

13:43.822 --> 13:44.623
I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY

13:44.690 --> 13:46.325
THAT COMES AROUND ASKING FOR IT.

13:46.392 --> 13:46.859
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES

13:46.926 --> 13:47.893
HAS THAT HAPPENED?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.728
&gt;&gt; MORE THAN YOU'D THINK.

13:49.795 --> 13:50.763
&gt;&gt; A HUNDRED?

13:50.829 --> 13:52.932
&gt;&gt; NEVER.

13:52.998 --> 13:57.269
&gt;&gt; THAT'S LESS THAN WE THOUGHT.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.804
&gt;&gt; PLEASE, MR. GIAPELLO,

13:58.871 --> 14:00.339
DO IT FOR LITTLE MAXIE.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.474
&gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

14:02.541 --> 14:04.977
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:05.044 --> 14:07.413
&gt;&gt; I WANT MY BROOM BACK.

14:07.479 --> 14:08.948
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE YOUR BROOM.

14:09.014 --> 14:09.682
&gt;&gt; TWO YEARS AGO,

14:09.748 --> 14:10.983
I LENT MY BROOM TO MRS. COLE

14:11.050 --> 14:12.051
ON THE FIFTH FLOOR

14:12.117 --> 14:13.953
AND SHE NEVER RETURNED IT.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.654
&gt;&gt; AND YOU WANT US TO GET IT?

14:15.721 --> 14:19.858
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

14:19.925 --> 14:20.859
&gt;&gt; NO WAY.

14:20.926 --> 14:21.794
&gt;&gt; PLEASE, MR. GIAPELLO

14:21.860 --> 14:22.628
WANTS IT BACK.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.330
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.831
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T BORROW THE BROOM,

14:25.898 --> 14:27.233
IT WAS A GIFT.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.601
&gt;&gt; WHAT A CRUMMY GIFT.

14:28.667 --> 14:29.435
IF SOMEONE GAVE ME A BROOM,

14:29.501 --> 14:30.869
I'D BE ALL, "GEE, THANKS."

14:30.936 --> 14:31.470
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF WE GOT YOU

14:31.537 --> 14:32.304
A BETTER GIFT?

14:32.371 --> 14:32.972
&gt;&gt; LIKE WHAT?

14:33.038 --> 14:33.906
&gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:33.973 --> 14:34.773
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WANT

14:34.840 --> 14:36.141
MR. DONOVAN'S HAT.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.243
&gt;&gt; WHO'S MR. DONOVAN?

14:37.309 --> 14:38.277
&gt;&gt; THE SUPER.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.745
YOU BRING ME HIS HAT

14:39.812 --> 14:44.416
AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIS BROOM.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.018
&gt;&gt; THIS IS ONE CRAZY BUILDING.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.286
&gt;&gt; WE'RE TAKING A LONG TIME.

14:47.353 --> 14:47.720
WHAT HAPPENS

14:47.786 --> 14:48.587
IF MR. MADIGAN WANTS

14:48.654 --> 14:49.989
A SECOND SCOOP OF ICE CREAM?

14:50.055 --> 14:50.489
&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY,

14:50.556 --> 14:51.123
JIMMY'S GONNA STALL HIM

14:51.190 --> 14:52.658
UNTIL WE GET BACK.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.027
&gt;&gt; HOW?

14:55.094 --> 14:55.494
&gt;&gt; UNCLE MAX,

14:55.561 --> 14:56.562
CAN I TALK TO YOU REAL FAST?

14:56.629 --> 14:57.162
&gt;&gt; CAN IT WAIT?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.564
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE 38th FLOOR

14:58.631 --> 14:59.632
FOR MY AFTERNOON SCOOP

14:59.698 --> 15:00.266
OF ICE CREAM.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.301
&gt;&gt; IT CAN'T WAIT.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.469
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL.

15:03.535 --> 15:08.307
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

15:08.374 --> 15:09.908
AMANDA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:09.975 --> 15:10.743
&gt;&gt; JUST TRYING TO BRING DOWN

15:10.809 --> 15:11.977
THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY

15:12.044 --> 15:13.078
OF MY HEAD.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.014
&gt;&gt; OH, STOP IT.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.716
I'M SURE YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

15:17.783 --> 15:22.288
&gt;&gt; AAH!

15:22.354 --> 15:23.489
&gt;&gt; THAT BAD?

15:23.555 --> 15:24.123
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO.

15:24.189 --> 15:27.026
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I SAW A SPIDER.

15:27.092 --> 15:27.893
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GET MY HAIR BACK

15:27.960 --> 15:28.294
TO NORMAL

15:28.360 --> 15:30.396
BEFORE THE PHOTOGRAPHER ARRIVES.

15:30.462 --> 15:30.963
&gt;&gt; WHEN'S HE COMING,

15:31.030 --> 15:31.463
NEXT MONTH?

15:31.530 --> 15:32.064
&gt;&gt; 20 MINUTES.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.966
&gt;&gt; AAH!

15:34.033 --> 15:34.466
&gt;&gt; I THINK I SAW

15:34.533 --> 15:35.334
THAT SPIDER AGAIN.

15:35.401 --> 15:40.773
&gt;&gt; I SAW IT THIS TIME TOO.

15:40.839 --> 15:41.173
SO TELL ME

15:41.240 --> 15:42.641
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, JIMMY.

15:42.708 --> 15:43.409
&gt;&gt; PROBLEM?

15:43.475 --> 15:43.876
&gt;&gt; THE REASON

15:43.942 --> 15:45.110
WHY WE CAME IN HERE.

15:45.177 --> 15:46.145
&gt;&gt; YES.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.447
IT'S ABOUT THIS GIRL, GWENDOLYN.

15:48.514 --> 15:49.181
I MET HER LAST SUMMER

15:49.248 --> 15:50.683
ON A BACKPACKING TRIP.

15:50.749 --> 15:51.283
SHE HAD A PINK RIBBON

15:51.350 --> 15:52.718
IN HER HAIR.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.319
I OFTEN THINK ABOUT

15:53.385 --> 15:55.854
THAT PINK RIBBON GWENDOLYN WORE

15:55.921 --> 15:57.756
WHEN I MET HER LAST SUMMER

15:57.823 --> 15:59.958
WHILE BACKPACKING.

16:00.025 --> 16:00.759
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

16:00.826 --> 16:01.927
&gt;&gt; I'M GETTING TO IT.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.596
&gt;&gt; OKAY. WHEN?

16:04.663 --> 16:05.831
&gt;&gt; SOON.

16:05.898 --> 16:06.932
ANYWAY, WHEN I MET HER,

16:06.999 --> 16:07.666
I HAD THE SENSATION

16:07.733 --> 16:09.034
I HAD MET HER BEFORE.

16:09.101 --> 16:09.568
I'M NOT SURE IF IT

16:09.635 --> 16:11.470
WAS A YEAR BEFORE OR TWO YEARS

16:11.537 --> 16:12.671
OR THREE YEARS,

16:12.738 --> 16:13.839
DEFINITELY NOT FOUR,

16:13.906 --> 16:15.407
MAYBE FIVE OR SIX.

16:15.474 --> 16:22.514
DID I SAY THREE?

16:22.581 --> 16:23.182
&gt;&gt; OH, BOY, I'D LOVE

16:23.248 --> 16:24.183
TO HELP YOU KIDS,

16:24.249 --> 16:26.518
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU MY HAT.

16:26.585 --> 16:27.152
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

16:27.219 --> 16:28.220
YOU'D LOVE TO HELP.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.722
&gt;&gt; THIS IS MY LUCKY HAT.

16:29.788 --> 16:30.389
IT'S THE INSPIRATION

16:30.456 --> 16:31.557
FOR MY MUSIC.

16:31.623 --> 16:32.524
YEAH.

16:32.591 --> 16:33.292
IN FACT, THE FIRST SINGLE

16:33.359 --> 16:34.460
OFF MY ALBUM IS ALL ABOUT

16:34.526 --> 16:35.327
THE HAT.

16:35.394 --> 16:36.128
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S IT CALLED?

16:36.195 --> 16:38.197
&gt;&gt; ALL ABOUT THE HAT.

16:38.263 --> 16:38.831
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE AN ALBUM?

16:38.897 --> 16:39.898
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.

16:39.965 --> 16:40.699
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE A BAND.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.568
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.

16:42.634 --> 16:43.135
&gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T SOUND

16:43.202 --> 16:46.205
LIKE YOUR HAT IS LUCKY AT ALL.

16:46.271 --> 16:46.872
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF WE BOUGHT YOU

16:46.939 --> 16:47.806
A NEW HAT?

16:47.873 --> 16:48.307
IT MIGHT CHANGE

16:48.374 --> 16:49.041
YOUR LUCK AROUND.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.043
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

16:51.110 --> 16:51.710
I REALLY LIKE THE WAY

16:51.777 --> 16:54.346
THIS HAT'S BROKEN IN.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.714
NAH, IT'S HARD TO GET A FIT

16:55.781 --> 16:59.051
LIKE THAT WITH A NEW HAT.

16:59.118 --> 16:59.685
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

16:59.752 --> 17:00.285
IT'S THE INSPIRATION

17:00.352 --> 17:01.453
FOR MY SECOND SINGLE,

17:01.520 --> 17:03.922
"RAIN, SLEET AND HAIL."

17:03.989 --> 17:05.491
♪ RAIN, SLEET, AND HAIL ♪

17:11.063 --> 17:12.698

17:13.565 --> 17:13.999
WE CAN BREAK YOU

17:14.066 --> 17:15.567
IN A NEW HAT AND YOU'LL LOVE IT

17:15.634 --> 17:16.435

17:16.502 --> 17:19.271
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.472
HEY, THAT'S NOT A BAD NAME

17:20.539 --> 17:22.007

17:36.588 --> 17:38.223
&gt;&gt; WHY DO I HAVE TO BE IN HERE?

17:38.290 --> 17:38.757
&gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T WORK

17:38.824 --> 17:39.491
IF THE HAT'S NOT ON

17:39.558 --> 17:40.559
SOMEONE'S HEAD.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.661
&gt;&gt; WHY DOESN'T LULU DO IT?

17:42.728 --> 17:43.562
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE SAY?

17:43.629 --> 17:43.996
&gt;&gt; HE SAID,

17:44.062 --> 17:44.563
"WE SHOULD PROBABLY

17:44.630 --> 17:46.331
GET STARTED."

17:46.398 --> 17:47.566
&gt;&gt; THE DIAL GOES UP TO 80.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.600
WHAT DO YOU WANNA START IT ON?

17:48.667 --> 17:54.473
&gt;&gt; I'D GO WITH 80.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.008
&gt;&gt; HOW'S IT GOING IN THERE?!

17:56.074 --> 17:58.911
&gt;&gt; IT'S COMING DOWN PRETTY HARD!

17:58.977 --> 18:03.482
&gt;&gt; OKAY, HERE COMES THE HAIL!

18:03.549 --> 18:05.951
&gt;&gt; AAH! TURN IT OFF!

18:06.018 --> 18:06.618
TURN IT OFF!

18:06.685 --> 18:07.186
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE SAY?

18:07.252 --> 18:07.753
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE SAID,

18:07.820 --> 18:14.460
"TURN IT UP."

18:14.526 --> 18:15.861
&gt;&gt; OKAY, I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.695
WE SHOULD DRY HIM OFF.

18:16.762 --> 18:27.272
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

18:27.339 --> 18:32.611
&gt;&gt; HI, KOPELMAN.

18:32.678 --> 18:33.879
&gt;&gt; TURN IT OFF!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.714
TURN IT OFF!

18:35.781 --> 18:36.715
&gt;&gt; GWENDOLYN'S FATHER SWORE

18:36.782 --> 18:37.583
HE WOULD FIND HIS KEYS

18:37.649 --> 18:39.051
IF IT TOOK HIM A HUNDRED YEARS.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.052
MEANWHILE, ON THE OTHER SIDE

18:40.118 --> 18:40.819
OF THE WORLD,

18:40.886 --> 18:42.488
A LITTLE GIRL FINDS A VIOLIN.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.189
&gt;&gt; JIMMY, I DON'T MEAN

18:44.256 --> 18:44.890
TO BE RUDE,

18:44.957 --> 18:46.058
BUT THIS STORY SEEMS TO BE FULL

18:46.125 --> 18:47.593
OF DETAIL AND PROSE,

18:47.659 --> 18:48.427
BUT WE'VE YET TO ARRIVE

18:48.494 --> 18:49.795
AT ANY SORT OF POINT.

18:49.862 --> 18:50.696
&gt;&gt; I'M GETTING TO IT.

18:50.762 --> 18:51.897
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.265
&gt;&gt; WAIT, THERE WAS A MURDER.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.333
&gt;&gt; A MURDER?

18:54.399 --> 18:56.435
&gt;&gt; YES, AND A CENTURY'S

18:56.502 --> 18:57.569
OLD CURSE.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.138
&gt;&gt; WOOO.

19:00.205 --> 19:00.672
&gt;&gt; DOES THIS COME

19:00.739 --> 19:02.074
INTO PLAY LATER?

19:02.140 --> 19:04.042
&gt;&gt; MAYBE.

19:04.109 --> 19:12.684
&gt;&gt; GO ON.

19:12.751 --> 19:29.201
&gt;&gt; WHOO.

19:29.268 --> 19:32.070
&gt;&gt; OH YEAH, THIS IS IT.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.338
THIS IS THE ONE.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.239
&gt;&gt; GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

19:34.306 --> 19:34.673
CAN WE HAVE

19:34.740 --> 19:37.543
THAT ICE CREAM RECIPE NOW?

19:37.609 --> 19:39.411
&gt;&gt; WHATEVER HAPPENS,

19:39.478 --> 19:39.912
DON'T LET IT GET

19:39.978 --> 19:41.780
INTO THE WRONG HANDS.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.148
&gt;&gt; LIKE WHO?

19:43.215 --> 19:51.356
&gt;&gt; THAT GUY.

19:51.423 --> 19:51.957
&gt;&gt; WAIT, I'M NOT DONE

19:52.024 --> 19:53.025
TELLING YOU ABOUT MY PROBLEM.

19:53.091 --> 19:54.192
&gt;&gt; JIMMY, I'VE BEEN LISTENING

19:54.259 --> 19:55.093
TO YOU FOR TWO HOURS.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.161
THE ONLY PROBLEM YOU HAVE

19:56.228 --> 19:57.195
IS THE INABILITY

19:57.262 --> 19:57.930
TO COME TO A POINT.

19:57.996 --> 19:58.964
&gt;&gt; I WAS ABOUT TO.

19:59.031 --> 19:59.798
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT

19:59.865 --> 20:00.666
UNTIL AFTER I'VE HAD

20:00.732 --> 20:01.567
MY ICE CREAM.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.602
&gt;&gt; UNCLE MAX, DON'T GO IN THERE.

20:03.669 --> 20:11.743
&gt;&gt; WHAH.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.745
SWEET MARY KITTENS,

20:13.812 --> 20:15.714
IT'S ALL MELTED.

20:15.781 --> 20:16.982
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU OKAY?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.216
ARE YOU MAD?

20:18.283 --> 20:20.185
ARE YOU SAD?

20:20.252 --> 20:21.720
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL.

20:21.787 --> 20:22.254
I SEEM TO HAVE

20:22.321 --> 20:23.188
A RANGE OF EMOTIONS,

20:23.255 --> 20:23.956
LIKE THAT MINISTER

20:24.022 --> 20:25.090
IN YOUR STORY.

20:25.157 --> 20:25.724
&gt;&gt; FATHER KEN?

20:25.791 --> 20:33.699
&gt;&gt; YES, FATHER KEN.

20:33.765 --> 20:34.333
&gt;&gt; OSCAR, HAVE YOU SEEN

20:40.639 --> 20:42.674
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL MELTED, TRUE.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.443
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, BUT I'VE GOT

20:44.509 --> 20:46.011
SOMETHING THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

20:46.078 --> 20:46.578
&gt;&gt; IT BETTER NOT BE

20:46.645 --> 20:47.913
A TWO-HOUR STORY ABOUT NOTHING,

20:47.980 --> 20:49.648
BECAUSE I ALREADY HEARD ONE.

20:49.715 --> 20:54.720
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S THIS.

20:54.786 --> 20:55.854

20:59.358 --> 20:59.858
IF YOU WANT.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.560
&gt;&gt; THIS IS AMAZING.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.362
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.796
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU COULD FORGIVE US

21:04.863 --> 21:05.230

21:05.297 --> 21:05.897

21:05.964 --> 21:07.199
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:07.265 --> 21:07.933
&gt;&gt; YOU WRECKED IT?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.501
&gt;&gt; NOT ME, MORE LIKE RYAN

21:09.568 --> 21:10.869
AND JIMMY, AND THEN,

21:10.936 --> 21:12.604
MORE LIKE RYAN.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.106
&gt;&gt; ALL IS FORGIVEN.

AND YOU WANNA KNOW

21:15.173 --> 21:15.807

21:22.981 --> 21:24.383
IT'S FANTASTIC.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.350
I'VE NEVER SEEN A COAT

21:25.417 --> 21:26.818
LIKE THIS BEFORE.
