Shane Smith:
<i>This week on</i> VICE:

00:09.839 --> 00:13.174
<i>Inside Assad's Syria.</i>

00:13.209 --> 00:15.176
(gunshots)

00:15.211 --> 00:17.011
(speaking foreign language)

00:19.249 --> 00:21.849
(chanting)

00:22.952 --> 00:24.652
Isobel Yeung: Something
very bizarre about that.

00:24.687 --> 00:27.655
I can't help but feel that
they might've been here for us.

00:27.690 --> 00:30.524
Smith:
<i>And then, an investigation</i>

00:30.560 --> 00:33.460
<i>into a massive global cover-up.</i>

00:33.495 --> 00:34.862
Woman:
<i>What we've learned recently</i>

00:34.897 --> 00:36.729
<i>is that ExxonMobil were
aware of the science,</i>

00:36.765 --> 00:38.565
they understood
it was a serious threat,

00:38.600 --> 00:40.200
<i>but in public,
they told us that it wasn't.</i>

00:40.235 --> 00:43.537
Anybody that tells you they've got this
figured out is not being truthful with you.

00:43.572 --> 00:45.805
Smith: <i>We just landed
here in the North Sea</i>

00:45.840 --> 00:51.078
to see how actually big oil and gas
can do something to reduce emissions.

00:51.113 --> 00:53.947

01:14.935 --> 01:16.602
In the fall of 2016,

01:16.637 --> 01:19.238
the civil war in Syria
reached its tipping point

01:19.273 --> 01:21.140
in the battle for Aleppo.

01:21.175 --> 01:22.174
<i>The city was divided between</i>

01:22.210 --> 01:24.443
<i>the eastern half, controlled
by rebel groups,</i>

01:24.479 --> 01:27.579
<i>and the western half, controlled
by longtime Syrian dictator</i>

01:27.615 --> 01:29.280
<i>Bashar Al-Assad.</i>

01:29.316 --> 01:32.851
Assad has been sharply condemned
by the international community

01:32.886 --> 01:34.853
for a long list of atrocities,

01:34.888 --> 01:38.323
including using chemical weapons
on his own people.

01:40.027 --> 01:42.760
Now, despite this
international condemnation,

01:42.795 --> 01:44.395
his forces retook the city

01:44.431 --> 01:46.464
<i>with the help
of the Russian military.</i>

01:46.500 --> 01:49.367
And, along the way,
earned the tacit approval

01:49.402 --> 01:50.801
of the incoming
American president.

01:50.837 --> 01:53.571
If Putin wants to go
and knock the hell out of ISIS,

01:53.607 --> 01:55.673
I am all for it, 100%.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.543
And I'm looking at Assad
and saying, maybe he's better

01:58.578 --> 02:00.778
than the kind of people that
we're supposed to be backing.

02:00.813 --> 02:04.581
Smith: <i>Isobel Yeung went to
government-controlled Aleppo</i>

02:04.617 --> 02:06.150
just before the city fell

02:06.185 --> 02:09.720
to see what an Assad victory
will look like going forward.

02:14.761 --> 02:19.196
(distant gunfire, explosions)

02:27.906 --> 02:30.140
Yeung: We've just got
to the city of Aleppo,

02:30.176 --> 02:32.042
which has had several hundred
mortars falling

02:32.077 --> 02:33.643
over the last couple of days.

02:33.679 --> 02:35.311
The government has tried to take

02:35.346 --> 02:36.512
a major supply road
of the rebels,

02:36.548 --> 02:41.284
and the rebels have retaliated
by sending hundreds of mortars.

02:41.319 --> 02:43.787
So, no neighborhood
is very safe.

02:43.822 --> 02:46.622
The whole of Aleppo
is essentially a front line.

02:48.493 --> 02:50.726
You can see the remains
of gas cannisters,

02:50.761 --> 02:54.129
which are responsible
for blowing up this area.

02:54.165 --> 02:55.298
Oh, careful.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.866
Every corner there's,
uh, these tarps,

02:57.902 --> 03:00.169
which are put up
to try and block snipers' views

03:00.205 --> 03:04.273
because the opposition
are literally just down there.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.975
We're hearing several mortars
very close to this area.

03:07.011 --> 03:08.476
- (man speaking)
- Wait?

03:12.750 --> 03:14.917
There's a sniper down there?

03:14.952 --> 03:16.085
Yeung:
Go, go, go!

03:24.994 --> 03:27.962
There's just sniper corners
all around Aleppo.

03:27.997 --> 03:29.631
(sighs)

03:29.666 --> 03:31.165
Fucking hell.

03:32.836 --> 03:35.270
Whoa. There's still
some people living up there.

03:37.274 --> 03:39.907
A bunch of IDPs,
who have nowhere else to go

03:39.943 --> 03:41.743
are living in these buildings,

03:41.778 --> 03:43.344
even though there's
snipers on every corner.

03:43.379 --> 03:46.147
So they're trying to tap into

03:46.182 --> 03:48.515
these temporary generators
that are put up.

03:48.551 --> 03:50.651
This web of wires is insane.

03:52.688 --> 03:54.855
There's just kids
wandering around here.

03:56.492 --> 03:57.991
Yeung:
<i>We were initially told</i>

03:58.026 --> 04:00.394
<i>that these civilian
areas were safe,</i>

04:00.429 --> 04:01.795
<i>But it quickly became evident</i>

04:01.830 --> 04:05.466
<i>that even government-controlled
Aleppo was not secure.</i>

04:05.501 --> 04:08.302
This is one of the houses
that's been hit by

04:08.337 --> 04:10.170
what the locals here
call "Hell 2,"

04:10.205 --> 04:13.740
which I think is... You can see
the remnants of that in here.

04:13.776 --> 04:15.942
Which is basically just...

04:15.978 --> 04:20.079
gas which is held inside these
glass jars or cannisters,

04:20.115 --> 04:21.748
and just blasts the walls

04:21.784 --> 04:23.716
and really obliterates
the place.

04:25.487 --> 04:27.387
(explosion)
Fuck.

04:27.422 --> 04:30.256
My God, this place

04:30.292 --> 04:31.758

04:33.495 --> 04:35.595

how people can still...

04:35.630 --> 04:38.531
Like, there's literally someone
still living next door.

04:49.076 --> 04:51.777

04:53.781 --> 04:55.380

<i>When the Arab Spring
reached Aleppo in 2012,</i>

<i>Assad's response

05:27.013 --> 05:29.580
<i>cutting food
and essential supplies.</i>

05:32.886 --> 05:37.421
<i>Then came massive shelling
and indiscriminate bombings.</i>

05:37.457 --> 05:39.923
<i>But while we were there, the
government was keen to show us</i>

05:39.959 --> 05:43.160
<i>that their side was
also taking casualties.</i>

05:49.402 --> 05:51.902
We are receiving
almost 100 cases...

05:51.937 --> 05:54.204
- 100 cases a day?
- Yes, daily.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.807
Yeung: How are the sanctions
impacting your work here?

05:57.843 --> 05:58.942
(Ateekh speaking)

06:12.791 --> 06:14.290
Yeung:
Do you ever get scared?

06:17.596 --> 06:20.497

electricity just goes... No problem.

06:22.901 --> 06:24.367
Okay.

06:27.305 --> 06:30.907
This is definitely not
easy conditions to work under.

Why haven't you left?

27:25.824 --> 27:28.491
So we're gonna see
the cost of global warming,

27:28.526 --> 27:31.661
the sea level rise, and actually
who's gonna pay for it.

27:32.797 --> 27:35.531
Smith: <i>During Superstorm
Sandy in 2012,</i>

27:35.566 --> 27:38.601
<i>waters around New York
swelled to 14 feet,</i>

27:38.636 --> 27:41.837
<i>ultimately causing $65 billion
worth of damage.</i>

27:41.872 --> 27:45.574
<i>Now almost everyone was surprised
at the extent of the destruction</i>

27:45.610 --> 27:47.476
<i>except for Swiss Re insurance,</i>

27:47.512 --> 27:50.246
<i>a global insurance company
who years earlier</i>

27:50.281 --> 27:52.480
<i>had predicted and prepared
for the damage</i>

27:52.516 --> 27:55.283
<i>a storm like Sandy would
inflict on New York.</i>

28:05.829 --> 28:08.263
Smith: <i>We spoke to the company's
chief property underwriter,</i>

28:08.298 --> 28:11.832
<i>Monica Ningen, to find out
how rising sea levels</i>

28:11.868 --> 28:13.268
<i>would impact Miami.</i>

28:13.303 --> 28:15.503
You guys do risk assessment.

28:15.539 --> 28:18.105
You did risk assessment
on New York

28:18.141 --> 28:19.407
and then Sandy happened.

28:19.442 --> 28:20.975
What's the risk assessment here?

28:21.010 --> 28:22.109
So, when you think about risk,

28:22.145 --> 28:24.279
- we don't predict when it's gonna happen.
- Right.

28:24.314 --> 28:27.214
We really look at if it happens,

28:27.249 --> 28:28.582
- what are the consequences.
- Right.

28:28.617 --> 28:30.217
What this map shows you is

28:30.252 --> 28:33.721
if there's a three-foot
rise in sea level...

28:33.756 --> 28:36.423
Which is the scientific consensus
by the end of the century.

28:36.458 --> 28:39.359
The dark blue
is gonna be the area

28:39.395 --> 28:41.261
- that's underwater.
- Wow.

28:41.297 --> 28:43.297
It's 145 billion...

28:43.332 --> 28:46.733
- Billion.
- 145 billion

28:46.768 --> 28:48.335
in property assets,

28:48.370 --> 28:51.505
- and 300,000 homes.
- Wow.

28:51.540 --> 28:53.307
So if you go to six feet,

28:53.342 --> 28:59.079
you now have $544 billion

28:59.114 --> 29:01.880
of property values exposed.
Half a trillion.

29:01.916 --> 29:05.984
You have 1.4 million homes.

29:07.788 --> 29:08.987
As an insurance company,

29:09.023 --> 29:11.423
if you're saying, okay, well,
the floods are gonna get worse,

29:11.458 --> 29:14.492
and, by the way, real estate's
getting more expensive,

29:14.528 --> 29:16.294
what do the costs look like?

29:16.330 --> 29:19.130
When you look at the residential
properties in the US,

29:19.165 --> 29:21.933
that's where they're insured
by the NFIP today.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.868
Right, so that's where
all of the risk goes.

29:23.903 --> 29:27.606
Smith: <i>The NFIP is the National
Flood Insurance Program</i>

29:27.641 --> 29:31.175
<i>run by FEMA that provides
coverage for homes in the US</i>

29:31.211 --> 29:33.711
<i>at affordable rates
regardless of risk.</i>

29:33.747 --> 29:36.680
So they have people
in higher hazard areas

29:36.716 --> 29:40.718
that are being subsidized
by people in lower areas.

29:40.754 --> 29:44.388
<i>Smith: Now what that means is the
program can offer cheaper rates</i>

29:44.423 --> 29:46.590
<i>to participants
in flood-prone regions</i>

29:46.626 --> 29:49.060
<i>because it's subsidized
by the federal government.</i>

29:49.095 --> 29:51.695
<i>But as harsher storms
are hitting the coastlines,</i>

29:51.731 --> 29:54.565
<i>the cost of this program
are pilling up.</i>

29:54.600 --> 29:56.533
- Unfortunately, it's running in the red.
- Right.

29:56.569 --> 29:58.001
How much is it losing now?

29:58.036 --> 30:00.437
I think it's about
$20 billion in debt.

30:00.473 --> 30:01.472
So it's $20 billion in debt,

30:01.507 --> 30:04.074
so they're sort of
robbing from Peter to pay Paul.

30:04.109 --> 30:07.210
And they expect that the government
is going to bail them out.

30:07.246 --> 30:10.380
If storms and storm surges
are getting worse,

30:10.415 --> 30:12.715
<i>we're already $20 billion
plus in debt,</i>

30:12.751 --> 30:16.686
then they won't be able to bail people
out 'cause they won't have any money.

30:16.721 --> 30:21.291
Yeah, so the NFIP has a borrowing limit,
and when they've reached that limit,

30:21.326 --> 30:23.559
they have to go back to the
Treasury and ask for more money.

30:23.595 --> 30:26.228
It's everybody's best guess as
to what that's gonna look like.

30:27.599 --> 30:29.965
Smith: <i>Today, Miami
Beach is already trying</i>

30:30.001 --> 30:32.168
<i>to do something
about the rising tides.</i>

30:32.203 --> 30:35.705
<i>The mayor, who recognizes the
threat posed by climate change,</i>

30:35.740 --> 30:38.441
<i>is now spending nearly half
a billion dollars city-wide</i>

30:38.476 --> 30:41.677
<i>on projects to mitigate
the rising sea levels.</i>

30:41.712 --> 30:44.213
<i>But remarkably, this isn't
the trend across Florida,</i>

30:44.248 --> 30:45.881
<i>which stands to lose thousands</i>

30:45.917 --> 30:48.050
<i>of square miles of land mass</i>

30:48.085 --> 30:50.953
<i>if current sea level rise
projections hold.</i>

30:50.988 --> 30:52.721
<i>But all of this is
seemingly lost</i>

30:52.756 --> 30:54.656
<i>on Florida Governor Rick Scott,</i>

30:54.692 --> 30:56.090
<i>who has actually gone so far</i>

30:56.126 --> 30:59.194
<i>as to ban the state's department
of Environmental Protection</i>

30:59.229 --> 31:01.663
<i>from actually using the phrases
"climate change"</i>

31:01.699 --> 31:05.500
<i>and "global warming"
in official documents.</i>

31:05.536 --> 31:07.402
Now when we first started
shooting this story,

31:07.438 --> 31:10.038
Governor Scott seemed to be
one of the last holdouts

31:10.073 --> 31:13.174
against the global scientific
and political consensus

31:13.210 --> 31:15.109
that climate change
must be addressed,

31:15.145 --> 31:17.812
<i>and furthermore,
must be addressed now,</i>

31:17.848 --> 31:21.382
<i>with President Obama himself
leading the call to action.</i>

31:21.417 --> 31:23.417
And no challenge,

31:23.453 --> 31:28.256
no challenge poses a greater threat to
future generations than climate change.

31:28.291 --> 31:30.424
And that's why
I will not let this congress

31:30.460 --> 31:32.159
endanger the health
of our children

31:32.194 --> 31:34.528
by turning back the clock
on our efforts.

31:34.564 --> 31:36.764
I am determined to make sure

31:36.799 --> 31:39.967
that American leadership
drives international action.

31:40.002 --> 31:42.470
Smith: <i>Now, historically,
the problem has always been</i>

31:42.505 --> 31:45.205
that America, China,
and the developing world

31:45.241 --> 31:47.274
could never agree
on emissions standards.

31:47.309 --> 31:50.277
But finally, because of the
seriousness of the situation,

31:50.312 --> 31:54.982
<i>on April 22, 2016, the world's
major carbon emitters,</i>

31:55.017 --> 31:56.750
<i>including the United
States and China,</i>

31:56.785 --> 31:58.952
<i>for the first time came together</i>

31:58.988 --> 32:01.188
<i>and ratified
the Paris agreement.</i>

32:01.223 --> 32:03.723
Finally, the world's
politicians had woken up

32:03.759 --> 32:05.592
to the immediacy
of climate change

32:05.627 --> 32:08.428
and the reality of global
scientific consensus.

32:08.463 --> 32:12.932
(crowd chanting)
USA! USA! USA!

32:12.967 --> 32:14.934
<i>But then a political
upset in America</i>

32:14.969 --> 32:17.003
<i>set the stage to slow down,</i>

32:17.038 --> 32:20.907
<i>and potentially even reverse the
application of the Paris protocols.</i>

32:20.942 --> 32:23.776
United States of America,
Donald Trump!

32:23.811 --> 32:27.046
Smith: <i>President Trump, himself
a climate change denier,</i>

32:27.081 --> 32:30.182
<i>has not only promised to pull
out of the Paris agreement,</i>

32:30.218 --> 32:33.119
<i>but has filled top cabinet
and government positions</i>

32:33.154 --> 32:35.788
with people who are allies of,
and in some cases,

32:35.823 --> 32:38.657
key players in
the fossil fuel industry.

32:38.692 --> 32:41.226
And many of them
still publicly doubt

32:41.261 --> 32:43.094
the human effect
on climate change.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.196
The science is
not settled on this

32:45.232 --> 32:48.767
just because you have a group of scientists who
have stood up and said "Here is the fact."

32:48.803 --> 32:51.769
Galileo got
outvoted for a spell.

32:51.805 --> 32:53.972
Anybody that tells you
they've got this figured out

32:54.007 --> 32:55.573
is not being truthful with you.

32:55.608 --> 32:58.509
There are too many complexities
around climate science

32:58.545 --> 33:00.312
for anybody to fully understand

33:00.347 --> 33:03.381
all of the cause and effects
and the consequences

33:03.417 --> 33:05.716
of what you may choose to do
to attempt to affect that.

33:05.752 --> 33:08.118
In reality, the Clean Power Plan
is nothing more

33:08.154 --> 33:11.288
than an attempt by the EPA
to expand federal agency power

33:11.324 --> 33:13.825
at the expense of state
energy power generation.

33:13.860 --> 33:18.028
You know Obama said the biggest
problem we have is global warming.

33:18.064 --> 33:21.899
And by the way, it's supposed
to be 70 degrees today,

33:21.935 --> 33:24.234
it's freezing here!

33:24.270 --> 33:25.802
Speaking of global warming.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.305
Where is...
We need some global warming!

33:28.341 --> 33:33.010
Smith: <i>Almost overnight, the most
powerful political entity in the world,</i>

33:33.045 --> 33:36.847
<i>the executive and legislative branches
of the United States government</i>

33:36.882 --> 33:39.183
are now led by climate deniers,

33:39.218 --> 33:42.418
leaving America as the sole
outlier in the developed world.

33:42.454 --> 33:48.024
<i>Now, confused as to why so many people
still don't believe in global warming,</i>

33:48.059 --> 33:49.926
<i>and question climate science,</i>

33:49.962 --> 33:52.228
<i>even in the face of global
scientific consensus,</i>

33:52.263 --> 33:56.967
<i>we spoke with Harvard professor
and investigator Naomi Oreskes,</i>

33:57.002 --> 33:58.701
<i>who has spent more than a decade</i>

33:58.736 --> 34:01.437
<i>analyzing the skepticism
around climate change.</i>

34:01.473 --> 34:04.374
Many of us think that
climate science is unsettled

34:04.409 --> 34:06.909
because that's what we've been
told for 25 years.

34:06.944 --> 34:09.411
The whole crux of the climate
denial campaign

34:09.447 --> 34:13.016
is to persuade us that the science is
unsettled and we don't really know.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.949
Now how does that strategy work?

34:14.985 --> 34:17.386
Oreskes: <i>Well, a large
part of the strategy is</i>

34:17.420 --> 34:19.889
<i>to use the media
to spread that message,</i>

34:19.924 --> 34:22.357
to present quote,
"both sides of the issue."

34:22.393 --> 34:24.560
Man is the cause of the warming.

34:24.594 --> 34:26.228
Is the science
settled about that?

34:26.263 --> 34:30.032
There's been a disconnect between what
the scientific community has been saying

34:30.067 --> 34:32.234
and the way it's been
presented in the media.

34:32.268 --> 34:34.702
97% of climate scientists say

34:34.737 --> 34:37.639
we are experiencing global climate change.
Who did the survey?

34:37.674 --> 34:39.107
When was it done? There's no such survey.
I don't know.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.842
There is! It's National Academy of
Sciences. There's no such survey.

34:41.878 --> 34:44.012
Oreskes: <i>They took what was
really a political debate</i>

34:44.047 --> 34:46.813
<i>and they dressed it up as if
it were a scientific debate.</i>

34:46.850 --> 34:49.382
<i>If you actually listen
to what scientists are saying,</i>

34:49.418 --> 34:51.452
if you read
the scientific literature,

34:51.487 --> 34:53.888
you see there is a consensus
about climate change.

34:53.924 --> 34:56.290
<i>Between 97 and 99% say</i>

34:56.324 --> 34:57.491
<i>absolutely climate
change is real.</i>

34:57.527 --> 35:00.094
<i>It's happening. It's underway.
It's caused by people.</i>

35:00.129 --> 35:03.264
Historians like myself
have known for a long time

35:03.299 --> 35:05.099
that academic
and government scientists

35:05.134 --> 35:06.934
were already talking
about climate change

35:06.969 --> 35:08.635
in the 1960s and '70s.

35:08.671 --> 35:11.672
What we've learned recently
is that ExxonMobil knew too.

35:11.707 --> 35:14.641
Smith: <i>Now this story
goes all the way back</i>

35:14.677 --> 35:17.911
<i>to when climate science
was in its early stages.</i>

35:17.947 --> 35:21.347
Dr. Research: <i> Due to our release through
factories and automobiles every year</i>

35:21.383 --> 35:24.818
<i>of more than six billion tons
of carbon dioxide,</i>

35:24.853 --> 35:27.187
<i>which helps air absorb
heat from the sun,</i>

35:27.222 --> 35:30.123
our atmosphere seems
to be getting warmer.

35:30.158 --> 35:31.892
This is bad?

35:31.927 --> 35:33.794
Well, it's been calculated

35:33.829 --> 35:35.896
a few degrees rise
in the Earth's temperature

35:35.931 --> 35:38.598
<i>would melt the polar ice caps.</i>

35:38.633 --> 35:41.367
♪ ♪

35:41.403 --> 35:42.969
What's particularly
troubling to me is,

35:43.004 --> 35:45.305
<i>we know that in private
the oil and gas companies</i>

35:45.340 --> 35:48.074
<i>were aware of the science, they
understood it was a serious threat,</i>

35:48.110 --> 35:50.343
but in public they told us
that it wasn't.

35:50.378 --> 35:53.412
The scientific evidence
remains inconclusive

35:53.447 --> 35:56.649
as to whether human activities
affect the global climate.

35:56.684 --> 35:59.051
In fact, many of their own
in-house scientists

35:59.087 --> 36:02.722
were working with government scientists
at the Department of Energy,

36:02.757 --> 36:06.225
<i>that they wrote memos
and reports to Exxon executives</i>

36:06.260 --> 36:08.527
<i>explaining that climate change
had the potential</i>

36:08.562 --> 36:11.163
to be both a serious
problem for humanity,

36:11.198 --> 36:13.999
and also a serious
business challenge for Exxon.

36:14.034 --> 36:16.067
One of the tragedies
of this story is

36:16.103 --> 36:18.604
that we know from
investigative reporting

36:18.639 --> 36:21.072
<i>that ExxonMobil understood it
before most everyone else,</i>

36:21.108 --> 36:23.808
when there still was a lot of
time to do something about it,

36:23.844 --> 36:25.744
when it wasn't too late to stop.

36:25.779 --> 36:28.680
<i>And instead,
when the science becomes clear,</i>

36:28.715 --> 36:30.414
<i>and the public
begins to learn about it,</i>

36:30.450 --> 36:33.251
Exxon makes a complete
about-face

36:33.286 --> 36:35.120
and goes into denial mode.

36:37.090 --> 36:40.025
<i>So they really hit this
drumbeat of uncertainty.</i>

36:40.060 --> 36:42.660
Smith: <i>An example of this
messaging can be seen</i>

36:42.695 --> 36:44.995
<i>by former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond</i>

36:45.031 --> 36:47.532
<i>in a 2005 television interview.</i>

36:47.567 --> 36:51.969
There is a natural variability
that has nothing to do with man.

36:52.004 --> 36:56.440
<i>The climate has changed every
year for millions of years.</i>

36:56.476 --> 36:58.776
It has to do with sunspots.

36:58.811 --> 37:00.477
It has to do with
the wobble of the Earth.

37:00.512 --> 37:04.381
Oreskes: <i>Exxon ran advertisements
in the New York Times</i>

37:04.416 --> 37:06.316
<i>that followed
the doubt-mongering strategy.</i>

37:06.351 --> 37:09.419
"The science isn't really settled,
there are a lot of uncertainties.

37:09.454 --> 37:12.156
<i>The models, the climate models
are very uncertain."</i>

37:12.191 --> 37:14.992
<i>And then we see a big
influx of fossil fuel money</i>

37:15.027 --> 37:18.461
to a whole set of what they call
"third party allies."

37:18.497 --> 37:21.130
Think tanks that are 501c3s,

37:21.166 --> 37:24.201
<i>these supposedly non-profit
organizations that do political work,</i>

37:24.236 --> 37:26.069
<i>that include the Cato Institute,</i>

37:26.104 --> 37:28.071
<i>the American
Enterprise Institute,</i>

37:28.106 --> 37:29.839
<i>the Competitive
Enterprise Institute,</i>

37:29.874 --> 37:31.274
<i>The Heartland Institute.</i>

37:31.310 --> 37:32.675
Millions or even
billions of dollars,

37:32.711 --> 37:35.011
<i>tax-deductible dollars
were being funneled.</i>

37:35.046 --> 37:38.280
<i>So that means that we, the
taxpayers are actually subsidizing</i>

37:38.316 --> 37:39.816
<i>this political activity</i>

37:39.851 --> 37:42.551
to prevent controls
on greenhouse gas emission.

37:42.587 --> 37:44.520
Don't you think that
when you write the report

37:44.555 --> 37:46.288
you ought to at least
have somebody

37:46.324 --> 37:48.057
who knows something
about the sun, please.

37:48.093 --> 37:51.660
Smith: <i>One scientist frequently
used by these think tanks</i>

37:51.696 --> 37:53.161
<i>is Dr. Willie Soon,</i>

37:53.197 --> 37:55.731
<i>speaking here at a Heartland
Institute-sponsored event,</i>

37:55.766 --> 37:58.267
<i>who illustrates
the depth of connections</i>

37:58.302 --> 38:01.403
<i>the fossil fuel industry has
in the skeptic community.</i>

38:01.439 --> 38:04.206
<i>Because in February 2015,
it emerged that</i>

38:04.242 --> 38:09.611
<i>Dr. Soon had received a total of
$1.25 million from a combination</i>

38:09.646 --> 38:10.879
<i>of ExxonMobil,</i>

38:10.914 --> 38:12.214
<i>Southern Company,</i>

38:12.249 --> 38:13.815
<i>The American
Petroleum Institute,</i>

38:13.851 --> 38:16.351
<i>and the Charles G. Koch
Foundation.</i>

38:16.386 --> 38:18.220
<i>Dr. Soon has since denied</i>

38:18.255 --> 38:21.623
<i>that his work was influenced
by the fossil fuel industry.</i>

38:21.658 --> 38:23.391
Now in addition
to funding think tanks,

38:23.426 --> 38:26.694
the oil and gas industry has
also dramatically increased

38:26.730 --> 38:29.764
the amount of money it
donates to political candidates.

38:29.799 --> 38:33.033
<i>From 12.3 million
a year in 1990,</i>

38:33.069 --> 38:36.203
<i>to 64.4 million in 2014.</i>

38:36.239 --> 38:38.239
And over the last 15 years,

38:38.274 --> 38:41.242
those companies have tripled
their funding for lobbyists,

38:41.277 --> 38:45.079
reaching 130 million
in 2015 alone.

38:47.316 --> 38:50.517
<i>Now this kind of debate
over scientific consensus</i>

38:50.552 --> 38:52.486
<i>is following
the familiar pattern</i>

38:52.521 --> 38:55.555
<i>of another national debate
that we've seen before.</i>

38:55.591 --> 38:57.023
Do you believe
nicotine is not addictive?

38:57.058 --> 38:59.125
I believe nicotine
is not addictive, yes.

38:59.161 --> 39:01.727
I think there's
a great deal of doubt

39:01.763 --> 39:03.829
as to whether or not
cigarettes are harmful.

39:03.864 --> 39:08.066
Why do 98% of smokers
never get anything?

39:08.102 --> 39:09.735
That's an interesting question.

39:09.771 --> 39:12.438
Why do non-smokers
get lung cancer?

39:12.473 --> 39:14.239
Doesn't it all add up
to the fact

39:14.275 --> 39:16.241
that we don't know
and nobody knows?

39:16.277 --> 39:18.777
Oreskes: <i>They knew that
tobacco was killing people.</i>

39:18.813 --> 39:20.679
<i>They knew that
their product was deadly.</i>

39:20.714 --> 39:23.048
<i>And they talked about it
among themselves in private,</i>

39:23.083 --> 39:25.017
but in public, they told us
that it wasn't true.

39:25.052 --> 39:28.153
<i>"We're not really sure.
There's a lot of uncertainties.</i>

39:28.189 --> 39:32.624
<i>"Many things cause cancer.
And therefore we shouldn't have</i>

39:32.659 --> 39:34.992
<i>"the government interfering
in the marketplace</i>

39:35.028 --> 39:36.528
to protect us
from the harms of tobacco."

39:36.563 --> 39:41.333
Smith: <i>Now almost the exact same strategies
that were employed by Big Tobacco</i>

39:41.368 --> 39:44.068
<i>are now being used
to deny climate change.</i>

39:44.103 --> 39:46.137
<i>And in some cases,
it's being done</i>

39:46.172 --> 39:48.105
<i>by the exact same people.</i>

39:48.141 --> 39:50.208
<i>In fact,
at the Heartland Institute's</i>

39:50.243 --> 39:52.409
<i>International Conference
on Climate Change,</i>

39:52.445 --> 39:53.744
<i>which we attended,</i>

39:53.779 --> 39:56.513
<i>the headliner that year
was Dr. Fred Singer,</i>

39:56.549 --> 39:58.916
<i>a Princeton-educated
Astrophysicist</i>

39:58.952 --> 40:01.319
<i>and leader in
the climate denier movement</i>

40:01.354 --> 40:02.786
<i>over the last 20 years.</i>

40:02.822 --> 40:06.790
Carbon dioxide is
not a pollutant. Please.

40:06.826 --> 40:10.227
Others: Carbon dioxide
is not a pollutant.

40:10.262 --> 40:11.895
It's good for you.

40:11.930 --> 40:14.965
Smith: <i>Singer's work was also
used by the tobacco industry</i>

40:15.000 --> 40:19.135
<i>to help perpetuate doubt around
some of the dangers of smoking.</i>

40:19.171 --> 40:22.773
I still think that the EPA has
cooked the data on secondhand smoke.

40:22.808 --> 40:26.743
Smith: <i>And other organizers, including
Heartland President Joe Bast,</i>

40:26.778 --> 40:29.112
<i>published reports questioning</i>

40:29.147 --> 40:32.382
<i>some of the health risks
of tobacco.</i>

40:32.417 --> 40:34.017
We don't see the data
that backs up

40:34.052 --> 40:36.586
the public claims that
global warming is a crisis.

40:36.621 --> 40:38.088
Let's just put it this way:

40:38.123 --> 40:39.589
There are a lot of very
strong parallels

40:39.624 --> 40:41.457
with what the tobacco
industry did,

40:41.493 --> 40:42.725
and courts have found

40:42.761 --> 40:45.194
that the tobacco industry
behavior was illegal.

40:45.229 --> 40:47.530
Smith:
<i>And just like Big Tobacco,</i>

40:47.565 --> 40:50.500
<i>which cost taxpayers untold
billions in health care,</i>

40:50.535 --> 40:53.536
<i>the cost of climate change
will be astronomical.</i>

40:53.571 --> 40:56.438
And if it can be proven
that, like tobacco,

40:56.473 --> 40:58.374
the oil companies
are actually at fault,

40:58.409 --> 41:01.576
then this could be one of
the largest lawsuits in history.

41:01.612 --> 41:04.713
Now, because of this,
two states' attorneys general

41:04.748 --> 41:07.783
<i>have launched investigations
against ExxonMobil,</i>

41:07.818 --> 41:11.820
<i>with 15 more recently
declaring their public support.</i>

41:11.855 --> 41:14.423
One thing we hope all reasonable
people can agree on

41:14.458 --> 41:17.358
is that every fossil fuel
company has a responsibility

41:17.394 --> 41:20.395
to be honest with its investors
and with the public

41:20.431 --> 41:24.599
about the financial and market
risks posed by climate change.

41:24.635 --> 41:27.335
Smith: <i>New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman</i>

41:27.370 --> 41:29.304
<i>is spearheading an investigation</i>

41:29.339 --> 41:32.740
<i>to find out exactly what
Exxon knew and when.</i>

41:32.775 --> 41:35.009
I know it's early days
in the investigation,

41:35.045 --> 41:38.413
and I sure don't want
to corrupt that in any way,

41:38.448 --> 41:41.349
but why is this happening now?
How is it going forward?

41:41.384 --> 41:44.285
There's really, I think,
a change in public attitude.

41:44.321 --> 41:46.454
Because people are associating
changes in the weather

41:46.489 --> 41:48.756
that they're actually seeing
and experiencing in their lives.

41:48.791 --> 41:50.157
You can't deny it anymore.

41:50.192 --> 41:54.061
We know that the water in
New York harbor is a foot higher

41:54.096 --> 41:55.830
- than it was in the early 20th century.
- Right.

41:55.865 --> 41:57.731
'Cause that's not 'cause
some fancy science,

41:57.767 --> 41:59.433
- that's 'cause we take measurements, right?
- Sure.

41:59.469 --> 42:01.669
This is not something that
requires a degree in physics.

42:01.704 --> 42:05.238
And we know that there are
people getting flooded here,

42:05.274 --> 42:07.640
in South Florida,
all over the United States

42:07.676 --> 42:09.309
in situations where
they wouldn't have before.

42:09.345 --> 42:12.045
We know it's happening,
and we want to find out

42:12.081 --> 42:13.680
what the fossil fuel
companies knew.

42:13.715 --> 42:16.183
Smith: <i>One company that
the Attorney General</i>

42:16.218 --> 42:19.652
<i>successfully brought legal action
against is Peabody Energy.</i>

42:19.688 --> 42:23.356
<i>Because the lawsuit found that the
company mislead its shareholders</i>

42:23.391 --> 42:25.758
<i>by saying that there
weren't reliable projections</i>

42:25.794 --> 42:28.895
<i>for how climate change
would affect their businesses.</i>

42:28.930 --> 42:31.430
<i>Now ExxonMobil
has made a similar argument...</i>

42:31.466 --> 42:35.034
<i>that there are no reliable models
for predicting climate change.</i>

42:35.069 --> 42:36.802
In the case of Peabody,
we learned

42:36.837 --> 42:38.371
that they were
doing studies to predict

42:38.406 --> 42:41.907
the impact on the coal market
of climate change

42:41.942 --> 42:44.643
and government actions
to deal with climate change,

42:44.678 --> 42:47.779
but they were telling their shareholders
it was impossible to estimate.

42:47.815 --> 42:50.816
If you have studies
and you are able to estimate

42:50.851 --> 42:52.718
the impact
on the market for coal,

42:52.753 --> 42:55.888
you can't tell your shareholders
that it's impossible to estimate

42:55.923 --> 42:58.423
the market for coal. So they
lied to their shareholders?

42:58.458 --> 43:01.292
They've agreed that they're
going to restate all of that.

43:01.328 --> 43:05.564
And it's something that we believe
exists with other companies.

43:05.599 --> 43:06.932
ExxonMobil, obviously,

43:06.967 --> 43:08.866
<i>the biggest and most profitable
energy company</i>

43:08.902 --> 43:10.235
<i>I think in the history
of the world.</i>

43:10.270 --> 43:14.172
We're interested in what science
they were using and what they knew.

43:14.207 --> 43:16.574
They publicly have stated,

43:16.609 --> 43:18.876
their CEO told Congress in 2010,

43:18.912 --> 43:22.747
"There is no competent model
to predict climate change."

43:22.782 --> 43:24.916
We think there is
a competent model,

43:24.951 --> 43:26.851
and we think they
probably were using it.

43:26.886 --> 43:29.353
Smith: <i>And that
former ExxonMobil CEO</i>

43:29.388 --> 43:32.023
<i>that used this
"no reliable model" argument</i>

43:32.058 --> 43:35.459
<i>is Rex Tillerson, who ran
ExxonMobil for ten years,</i>

43:35.494 --> 43:39.096
<i>and now is the Trump
administration's Secretary of State.</i>

43:39.131 --> 43:41.365
<i>Now before
moving into government,</i>

43:41.400 --> 43:45.802
<i>Tillerson oversaw the largest
fossil fuel company in the world.</i>

43:45.837 --> 43:48.238
<i>And as late as 2010,
he testified</i>

43:48.274 --> 43:51.841
<i>that Exxon still had no
reliable models available</i>

43:51.877 --> 43:53.610
<i>to predict climate change.</i>

43:53.645 --> 43:55.546
Being a science
and engineering company,

43:55.581 --> 43:59.849
we understand the science,
we understand the difficulties

43:59.885 --> 44:01.718
of modeling the science.

44:01.753 --> 44:05.055
And as we look at
the competency of those models,

44:05.090 --> 44:08.324
there's not a model available
today that is competent.

44:08.359 --> 44:11.160
We think they use the best
science for their engineering,

44:11.196 --> 44:14.663
and aren't spending billions of shareholder
dollars drilling in the Arctic

44:14.699 --> 44:17.300
without having the best climate science
to tell them what's happening.

44:17.335 --> 44:20.236
Smith: <i>Now ExxonMobil
declined to speak with us</i>

44:20.271 --> 44:21.870
<i>on camera about the lawsuit.</i>

44:21.906 --> 44:24.240
<i>But they did reply
with a statement</i>

44:24.275 --> 44:27.110
<i>acknowledging that climate
change is in fact real,</i>

44:27.145 --> 44:28.877
<i>and suggesting
that everyone should</i>

44:28.913 --> 44:31.513
<i>act to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.</i>

44:31.548 --> 44:35.250
<i>Now in terms of the lawsuit,
they replied, and I quote...</i>

44:44.228 --> 44:47.729
<i>Now even though Exxon refused to speak
with us directly on the matter,</i>

44:47.764 --> 44:50.832
<i>we were able to speak
to Dr. Morrel Cohen,</i>

44:50.867 --> 44:54.369
<i>a senior scientist at Exxon
Labs for nearly two decades,</i>

44:54.404 --> 44:57.705
<i>on the company's early approach
to climate change.</i>

44:57.741 --> 45:01.976
There were concerns
about global warming.

45:02.012 --> 45:05.379
<i>And they were measuring
carbon dioxide</i>

45:05.414 --> 45:08.215
<i>concentration of the atmosphere
over the ocean</i>

45:08.251 --> 45:11.252
<i>by putting sensors
on an oil tanker.</i>

45:11.287 --> 45:13.988
And they did
respectable simulations.

45:14.024 --> 45:18.159
<i>And they were keeping up with
the advance of climate science.</i>

45:18.194 --> 45:21.028
I mean, the science
is very well established.

45:21.063 --> 45:25.399
The people running a corporation
like Exxon are not all stupid.

45:25.434 --> 45:28.269
They are supporting activities
that enable them to understand

45:28.304 --> 45:30.771
what is going on in the science
on the one hand,

45:30.806 --> 45:34.475
and on the other hand, they're
taking actions that enable them

45:34.510 --> 45:36.610
<i>to slow the process of change,</i>

45:36.646 --> 45:40.580
and to play a significant role
in controlling it

45:40.615 --> 45:42.716
<i>to the advantage
of the corporation.</i>

45:42.751 --> 45:44.785
<i>They've created
a situation where</i>

45:44.820 --> 45:47.120
they can deny being deniers.

45:47.156 --> 45:50.824
Now history has shown that
despite their public skepticism,

45:50.859 --> 45:53.426
ExxonMobil and other
oil companies have quietly

45:53.461 --> 45:56.762
taken climate change science
very seriously indeed.

45:56.798 --> 46:01.133
<i>For example, in 1989,
when Dutch oil giant Shell</i>

46:01.169 --> 46:05.004
<i>spent millions to raise the height
of its off-shore drilling platform</i>

46:05.039 --> 46:08.007
<i>in response to sea level
rise projections.</i>

46:08.042 --> 46:10.076
<i>Now this is 25 years ago</i>

46:10.111 --> 46:13.012
<i>that oil companies knew that
sea level rise was happening.</i>

46:13.047 --> 46:18.117
<i>So much so that they actually
made moves to adapt to it.</i>

46:18.152 --> 46:19.819
<i>Now the problem with all of this</i>

46:19.854 --> 46:21.787
<i>is that oil companies
up until now</i>

46:21.823 --> 46:24.790
<i>have been less than
transparent to say the least.</i>

46:24.826 --> 46:27.526
<i>The only oil company
that bucks that trend</i>

46:27.561 --> 46:30.262
<i>and was willing to be
open with us is Statoil,</i>

46:30.297 --> 46:32.331
<i>one of the largest
oil companies in the world.</i>

46:32.366 --> 46:35.400
<i>And that's because it's owned
by the Norwegian government,</i>

46:35.436 --> 46:37.769
<i>which publicly
believes in climate change,</i>

46:37.804 --> 46:40.739
<i>and as such, is taking
steps to mitigate it.</i>

46:40.774 --> 46:45.610
♪ ♪

46:54.420 --> 46:56.287
We just landed here
in the North Sea

46:56.322 --> 46:58.389
on Sleipner oil
and gas platform,

46:58.424 --> 46:59.523
one of the biggest in the world.

46:59.559 --> 47:02.226
And so we actually came here
just to talk to a company

47:02.262 --> 47:03.494
that, for more than 20 years,

47:03.529 --> 47:05.730
has admitted that
climate change is real.

47:05.765 --> 47:07.965
They actually supported
the Kyoto Protocols,

47:08.000 --> 47:09.967
and more than that,
they did something about it.

47:10.002 --> 47:11.469
<i>So we're gonna go
around the rig,</i>

47:11.504 --> 47:12.836
<i>we're gonna see
how it functions,</i>

47:12.872 --> 47:15.473
and see how actually
big oil and gas

47:15.508 --> 47:18.708
can do something
to reduce emissions.

47:20.146 --> 47:22.746
You guys knew that
sea level rise was happening.

47:22.782 --> 47:26.016
Shell knew it. You said, "Look, we have
to raise the level of the platforms."

47:26.051 --> 47:27.450
But at the same time in America,

47:27.486 --> 47:29.052
billions of dollars
were being spent

47:29.088 --> 47:31.155
on saying it wasn't happening.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.560
Right.

47:46.171 --> 47:49.772
Smith: <i>Statoil has deployed
technology on its rig to extract</i>

47:49.808 --> 47:52.341
<i>most of the carbon from
the natural gas it's drilling.</i>

47:52.376 --> 47:55.278
How much carbon
are you capturing?

47:55.313 --> 47:56.813
How much are you putting back,

47:56.848 --> 47:58.514
and what does that look like?

48:01.019 --> 48:02.118
Yeah.

48:08.359 --> 48:09.425
Every year?

48:09.460 --> 48:11.694
So it's a huge impact.

48:11.729 --> 48:13.529
Smith: <i>Their carbon
capture technology</i>

48:13.564 --> 48:15.397
<i>could be a model
for other oil companies,</i>

48:15.433 --> 48:19.601
<i>thereby dramatically reducing
CO2 emissions around the world.</i>

48:19.637 --> 48:21.437
What's actually
coming up through here now?

48:24.741 --> 48:27.142
What you're doing here is
you're taking that,

48:27.177 --> 48:29.878
separating the oil,
the gas, and the CO2...

48:42.191 --> 48:45.626
Smith: <i>Statoil takes the excess
CO2 from the natural gas</i>

48:45.662 --> 48:49.096
<i>and sequesters it into a massive
cavity under the ocean,</i>

48:49.131 --> 48:52.834
<i>where they say they can store
it for thousands of years.</i>

48:52.869 --> 48:56.136
The more CO2 you take
out of the gas,

48:56.172 --> 48:58.405
the less CO2 gets burned

48:58.440 --> 49:00.107
and released into
the atmosphere.

49:00.142 --> 49:03.076
So how many of these
are there in the world?

49:04.612 --> 49:07.213
You guys work for
an oil company.

49:07.249 --> 49:10.683
Do you favor a CO2 tax
for oil companies?

49:14.155 --> 49:15.588
Right.

49:15.623 --> 49:16.655
Why?

49:17.958 --> 49:20.659
So if we tax carbon,

49:20.695 --> 49:23.529
more companies will be
doing this kind of thing,

49:23.564 --> 49:26.231
which reduces the carbon
released into the...

49:26.267 --> 49:28.000
the CO2 released
into the atmosphere.

49:28.035 --> 49:30.803
Smith: <i>Now even though
oil and gas constitutes</i>

49:30.838 --> 49:32.772
<i>the majority
of Norway's exports,</i>

49:32.807 --> 49:35.607
<i>they actually imposed
a tax on energy production,</i>

49:35.642 --> 49:37.442
<i>which encouraged
Statoil to develop</i>

49:37.477 --> 49:39.144
<i>a cleaner way of doing business.</i>

49:39.179 --> 49:42.347
<i>Now economists widely see
carbon taxes like this</i>

49:42.383 --> 49:44.917
<i>as the most efficient way
to make carbon capture</i>

49:44.952 --> 49:46.684
<i>and renewable energy sources</i>

49:46.720 --> 49:49.321
<i>more viable
for energy companies.</i>

49:49.356 --> 49:51.723
A carbon tax is
a kind of a pollution tax.

49:51.758 --> 49:54.626
If you want to discourage
people from doing something,

49:54.661 --> 49:56.294
one way to discourage it

49:56.329 --> 49:58.229
is to make that
activity more expensive.

49:58.264 --> 50:00.799
<i>So if you think about
something like pollution,</i>

50:00.834 --> 50:04.836
<i>if you don't want a company
to dump pollution into the air,</i>

50:04.871 --> 50:06.003
<i>you can charge for that.</i>

50:06.039 --> 50:09.506
That creates a financial
disincentive for that activity,

50:09.542 --> 50:12.276
and encourages the company
to be more efficient

50:12.312 --> 50:14.412
<i>in their fuel use,
or switch to non-polluting</i>

50:14.447 --> 50:16.247
<i>forms of energy
like solar and wind.</i>

50:16.282 --> 50:18.582
And also, it would help
reflect the true cost,

50:18.617 --> 50:21.252
or what sometimes people
call the social cost of carbon.

50:21.287 --> 50:23.354
<i>Because fossil fuels
do all this damage,</i>

50:23.389 --> 50:27.090
<i>but we don't pay that price
when we fill our car with gas.</i>

50:27.125 --> 50:31.194
So carbon tax is a way to make
the price reflect the true cost.

50:31.229 --> 50:34.097
Smith: <i>Now today
ExxonMobil publicly states</i>

50:34.132 --> 50:36.366
<i>that they support
some form of carbon tax.</i>

50:36.401 --> 50:38.435
<i>But the political atmosphere
they helped shape</i>

50:38.471 --> 50:41.137
<i>for the last three decades
patently doesn't.</i>

50:41.173 --> 50:47.043
That we would put American's
economy at jeopardy

50:47.079 --> 50:50.746
based on scientific theory
that's not settled yet,

50:50.782 --> 50:52.949
to me is just... is nonsense.

50:52.985 --> 50:55.618
All we'll do is end up
hurting our country,

50:55.653 --> 50:57.954
our people, especially
the low-income individuals.

50:57.989 --> 51:00.590
And especially with these programs
they're asking us to pass

51:00.625 --> 51:02.391
that will do nothing
to help the environment,

51:02.426 --> 51:04.126
but will be devastating
for our economy.

51:04.161 --> 51:06.596
Smith: <i>In fact, of the
top ten recipients</i>

51:06.631 --> 51:09.632
<i>of oil and gas industry money
currently holding office,</i>

51:09.667 --> 51:11.868
<i>fully nine are climate skeptics,</i>

51:11.903 --> 51:14.169
<i>and all ten have
repeatedly opposed</i>

51:14.205 --> 51:16.372
<i>a number of carbon tax proposals</i>

51:16.407 --> 51:18.173
<i>and EPA regulations</i>

51:18.209 --> 51:19.908
<i>on greenhouse gas emissions.</i>

51:19.943 --> 51:24.146
<i>President Donald Trump was one
of the top names on the list.</i>

51:24.181 --> 51:28.283
<i>We're going to cancel
the Paris climate agreement.</i>

51:28.319 --> 51:31.920
And stop...
(crowd cheers)

51:31.955 --> 51:34.255
Unbelievable.

51:34.290 --> 51:38.326
And stop all payments of
the United States' tax dollars

51:38.361 --> 51:41.530
to UN global warming programs.

51:41.565 --> 51:43.064
Smith:
<i>The new Secretary of Energy,</i>

51:43.099 --> 51:44.666
<i>former Texas Governor
Rick Perry,</i>

51:44.701 --> 51:47.468
<i>famously vowed as
presidential candidate</i>

51:47.504 --> 51:50.104
<i>to eliminate the department
he now runs.</i>

51:50.140 --> 51:53.374
<i>And Attorney General
Jeff Sessions, over his career,</i>

51:53.410 --> 51:56.577
<i>had a record of launching
legislation aimed at halting</i>

51:56.612 --> 51:59.447
<i>landmark climate
and environmental action.</i>

51:59.482 --> 52:01.416
But perhaps
the most troubling of all

52:01.451 --> 52:04.418
is that former ExxonMobil
CEO Rex Tillerson,

52:04.453 --> 52:06.987
<i>the man who ran the company
at the center</i>

52:07.023 --> 52:09.924
<i>of the ongoing Attorney General
of New York's investigation,</i>

52:09.959 --> 52:12.560
<i>is now the Secretary of State.</i>

52:12.595 --> 52:16.196
Now with President Trump's cabinet,
so stocked with climate deniers,

52:16.231 --> 52:17.598
and his party's control over

52:17.633 --> 52:20.333
<i>the executive branch,
Congress, the Senate,</i>

52:20.369 --> 52:23.903
<i>and assuming his nominee is
approved, the Supreme Court,</i>

52:23.939 --> 52:25.605
America now runs the risk

52:25.640 --> 52:28.508
of setting back the clock
on global climate change

52:28.544 --> 52:30.177
for the foreseeable future.

52:32.414 --> 52:35.882
Oreskes: <i> There are going to be a lot of
damages associated with climate change.</i>

52:35.917 --> 52:37.283
Who's going to pay for that?

52:37.318 --> 52:40.252
Right now the model we have
is that we all pay.

52:40.288 --> 52:42.288
<i>So I think we're going
to increasingly see</i>

52:42.323 --> 52:44.090
people raising the question,

52:44.125 --> 52:46.258
well, maybe companies
like ExxonMobil,

52:46.294 --> 52:47.894
<i>who knew that this was a problem</i>

52:47.929 --> 52:50.496
<i>and spent money
to deny that in public,</i>

52:50.531 --> 52:52.598
and to mislead us
about these facts,

52:52.633 --> 52:55.234
they have some additional
fiscal accountability

52:55.269 --> 52:58.637
to help pay for the damages
associated with climate change.

53:00.774 --> 53:02.874
- This is a huge...
- It's big.

53:02.910 --> 53:05.111
National crisis. This is a huge
global crisis. It's very big.

53:05.146 --> 53:08.947
And if you are preventing
people from taking action

53:08.983 --> 53:10.616
to protect themselves

53:10.651 --> 53:11.750
by putting out bad information

53:11.785 --> 53:15.587
or telling them you can't
rely on all of the scientists

53:15.623 --> 53:17.889
who are all trying
to tell the world

53:17.925 --> 53:20.926
that we've got a problem we have
to take action on right now,

53:20.961 --> 53:23.394
that's pretty serious.

53:23.430 --> 53:27.798
<i>This is not something that's gonna hurt
people ten years or 20 years from now.</i>

53:27.834 --> 53:30.135
<i>This is something that's
hurting people today.</i>

53:30.170 --> 53:33.070
And if there are folks trying
to dissuade the public

53:33.106 --> 53:35.507
from doing things to protect the
planet and protect themselves,

53:35.542 --> 53:36.907
that's a pretty serious offense.

53:36.943 --> 53:38.643
That's a pretty
serious consequence of fraud.

53:38.678 --> 53:39.977
And that's so big,

53:40.013 --> 53:42.579
the only thing that I can
draw a parallel to

53:42.615 --> 53:43.848
is Big Tobacco.

53:43.883 --> 53:46.784
Now that was, I believe, the
largest settlement in history.

53:46.819 --> 53:48.218
This seems to be bigger

53:48.254 --> 53:50.454
because those were just smokers,
this is everyone.

53:50.489 --> 53:52.923
It's hard to say
exactly what we'll find.

53:52.959 --> 53:54.825
But the American people
are very forgiving,

53:54.861 --> 53:57.294
but once they understand
that they have been wronged,

53:57.329 --> 53:59.949
the American people
can be very tough.
