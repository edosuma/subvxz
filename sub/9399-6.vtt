00:02.936 --> 00:04.460
I'm not here to talk about Jamie.

00:04.537 --> 00:06.971
I'd just always wondered
if he knows who I am.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.564
He found a picture of you once.

00:08.641 --> 00:10.836
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him you were dead.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.407
It's Mia. She's the magic, Peyton.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.541
And I'm telling you, her spark is
getting squashed by this ass of a singer.

00:17.617 --> 00:20.142
Oh, this is for you.
It's supposed to bring good luck.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.889
I know we just met, but I just wanted
you to know that I'm here.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.152
Good to know.

00:26.226 --> 00:29.662
Any student who walks out
that door fails this quarter.

00:29.729 --> 00:33.028
Say goodbye to extracurricular
activities, say goodbye to sports.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.361
Like basketball.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.365
Well, well. Hello, Jamie.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.737
How would you like
to come live with Grandpa?

01:25.251 --> 01:27.811
Mama. Daddy, Mama.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.951
Hey, baby. What's the matter?

01:32.158 --> 01:35.150
- Did you have a bad dream, buddy?
- He tried to get me.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.588
- Who did?
- Grandpa Dan. He escaped.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.027
- From heaven?
- Prison.

01:43.403 --> 01:46.531
- Did you tell Jamie my dad's in prison?
- Maybe.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.172
- Why?
- Because he's in prison.

01:49.242 --> 01:50.470
(SIGHS)

01:51.010 --> 01:53.706
- Why, what'd you tell him?
- We told him he was dead.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.977
Man, how am I supposed to know that?
I mean, he be asking me stuff.

01:57.050 --> 02:00.076
Well, you have to lie to him, man.
He's having nightmares now.

02:00.153 --> 02:02.781
Look, you know he be tricking me.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.856
He got all, like, cute.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.853
Yeah, I know.
He does have that going for him.

02:08.928 --> 02:12.227
Well, all right, you said he asked you stuff.
What else did you tell him?

02:12.298 --> 02:15.859
- Nothing much. Just the truth.
- Like?

02:15.935 --> 02:18.529
Like, the Man killed Tupac and Biggie.

02:18.605 --> 02:21.768
Never date girls named Bevin
and Santa Claus is black.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.571
Wow. You say anything
about the Easter Bunny?

02:24.711 --> 02:25.700
A bunny that lay eggs?

02:25.778 --> 02:28.906
Man, you know how many questions
he would have asked me about that?

02:28.982 --> 02:31.246
All right, well, just stay clear
of the whole Dan thing

02:31.317 --> 02:33.512
until we figure out how
we're gonna handle this, okay?

02:33.586 --> 02:35.884
Fine by me. I won't say a word.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.997
<i>MAN: (SINGING)</i>

02:46.065 --> 02:49.159
<i>Love is a bird in hand</i>

02:49.235 --> 02:51.829
<i>And when this stops</i>

02:51.905 --> 02:55.204
- Can I help you?
- Is that your room?

02:58.378 --> 03:00.005
Used to be mine.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.604
Wanna see it?

03:04.117 --> 03:08.383
You sure? I mean, I could be a psycho.
You don't know, it happens.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.980
You're not a psycho. You're Peyton.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.090
Come on.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.022
<i>Just pretend</i>

03:18.097 --> 03:22.727

03:22.802 --> 03:24.963
Wow. It's different.

03:26.806 --> 03:29.172
- Molly.
- Molly. Yeah, God.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.644
You know, when I lived here,
the walls were red.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.646
A red bedroom? That's crazy.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.877
Oh, no, it was everything I wanted it to be.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.212
But, I mean, this is nice too.

03:40.286 --> 03:41.776
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

03:43.022 --> 03:47.152
So you really loved him, huh? Lucas?

03:47.827 --> 03:49.624
What, are you some kind of psychic?

03:53.166 --> 03:55.259
Was it really true love always?

04:00.840 --> 04:03.104
I could never just lay on their table.

04:03.176 --> 04:07.135
One would think that since they charge
by the hour for this little venture,

04:07.213 --> 04:09.306
you might be more punctual.

04:10.483 --> 04:14.010
- You're Brooke's mom, right?
- Victoria.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.147
Also known as the money behind this,
whatever this is.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.214
- You're the producer?
- Yeah, I'm Haley.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.558
I'm sorry, it's nice to meet you.
I'm a good friend of Brooke's.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.827
Brooke has so many good friends
since her success.

04:27.300 --> 04:33.034
Having said that,
I'd like to have a listen to our investment.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.938
- Okay, I'll just give Peyton a call.
- No, I really don't have time for that,

04:38.011 --> 04:41.503
and God knows what gutter
Peyton Sawyer is lying in.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.105
So if you don't mind...

04:43.182 --> 04:46.948
- You know what? I'm gonna wait in there.
- Yeah. That's fine.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.491
- That person creeps me out.
- Yeah, okay, I know, me too.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.151
Listen, you're gonna do great, you're fine.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.696
I just want you to play her, like,
a few bars of <i>No Good</i>

04:57.764 --> 04:59.755
and that will make her happy, okay?

04:59.832 --> 05:01.595
Right, like that old thing
could ever be happy.

05:01.668 --> 05:02.657
Okay.

05:02.735 --> 05:07.069
So obviously this is the acoustic version,
but Mia really is great

05:07.140 --> 05:08.801
and I think you're just gonna love her.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.866
So if you wanna come
into the booth with me...

05:10.943 --> 05:13.707
- I'm comfortable here, thank you.
- Okay.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.990
<i>Okay, Mia, whenever you're ready.</i>

05:27.193 --> 05:29.161
<i>The song is called</i> No Good.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.663
- She's really nervous.
- Can you blame her?

05:31.731 --> 05:34.723
It's like she's playing a private concert
for Satan's wife.

05:44.277 --> 05:48.270
(SINGING) Never fear the unexpected

05:48.381 --> 05:49.439
Until I...

05:49.515 --> 05:52.143
Okay, thank you. Thank you, thank you.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.009
No, no, no, no, no.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.645
The song's called <i>No Good?</i>

05:57.857 --> 05:59.256
Appropriate.

05:59.325 --> 06:02.123
- Okay, so this is a huge waste of money.
- Well...

06:02.195 --> 06:06.393
I would say it was a waste of time, but
you all failed so quickly, it really wasn't.

06:06.466 --> 06:09.026
So when you locate Peyton in that gutter,

06:09.102 --> 06:14.199
you let her know I'd like to speak with her
before this catastrophe goes any further.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.250
Hey, okay, so tell me again.
What happened? She walked in...

06:31.324 --> 06:33.588
Yeah, we walked in
and Bitchtoria was there waiting.

06:33.659 --> 06:36.355
Next thing I know, she scares Mia
half to death and then Mia's gone.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.453
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.827
She just packed up her stuff,

06:38.898 --> 06:40.889
said she sucked a bunch of times
and then took off.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.867
Can you blame her?
She must've been humiliated.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.129
- I mean, that was ugly.
- Yeah.

06:44.203 --> 06:47.229
I'm sorry, can you just
give us a few minutes?

06:50.610 --> 06:51.736
All right, what is Lindsey doing here?

06:51.811 --> 06:53.472
She came with me,
we're gonna have lunch.

06:53.546 --> 06:56.379
Okay, I don't want her here. You know
how temperamental artists are, Haley.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.610
- So, apparently, are label owners.
- No, she doesn't belong here.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.777
- I don't want anyone in the studio.
- Anyone or Lindsey?

07:00.853 --> 07:02.787
Anyone including Lindsey.

07:02.855 --> 07:04.584
Look, I know everyone loves her.
That's great, fine.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.716
But right now Mia's gone
and she's in here running her mouth

07:06.793 --> 07:07.782
about how ugly everything is.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.487
She didn't mean anything by it,
Peyton, okay?

07:09.562 --> 07:11.894
Don't get mad at Lindsey
just because Mia's gone.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.659
- I'm not mad at her.
- You sound mad at her.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.566
I'm not, I... Maybe I just don't like her.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.595
Well, you don't have to...

07:24.911 --> 07:27.709
- I'm gonna go, Haley.
- Yeah, I'll see ya.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.190
Hey, Mouth.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.225
You guys scared me.
What's... What's going on?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.458
- We're hiding from Alice.
- Why?

07:46.532 --> 07:49.228
- Have you met Alice?
- Hey, hey, Carlton.

07:49.936 --> 07:53.565
Because working on the weekend sucks
and we've all had it.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.674
- That's why you gotta talk to her.
- Me?

07:57.743 --> 07:58.903
- Yeah.
- Why me?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.469
You're the only one
that's ever stood up to her, Mouth.

08:01.547 --> 08:02.912
Listen, guys, I don't know.

08:02.982 --> 08:07.681
Look, Mouth, either you talk to her
or we go with Plan B.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.551
What's Plan B?

08:09.622 --> 08:13.388
Pool all our money together,
we hire a hit man and take her out.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.656
- I say Plan B.
- Come on, guys, she's not that bad.

08:17.463 --> 08:22.025
Come on, Mouth, admit it.
You hate her, too. And do you know why?

08:24.136 --> 08:26.127
Because Alice is a bitch.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.736
Peyton is a bitch.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.674
Your mom's a bitch.

08:33.746 --> 08:34.770
What happened?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.578
She went to the recording studio
and freaked out Mia who is MIA,

08:38.650 --> 08:40.744
imagine that,
and now I don't have an artist.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.481
I'm sorry, Peyton, I'll talk to her.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.386
Well, it's either that
or my fist talks to her face

08:44.457 --> 08:46.118
and that's gonna be a longer conversation.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.387
- I will. I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.362
I'm gonna see you at home.
I gotta find Mia.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.590
- My mother.
- Oh, no.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.861
- What?
- It's him.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.631
- Who?
- The hot guy I met at the opening.

09:01.974 --> 09:04.169
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

09:04.243 --> 09:07.076
- Step aside, hot guy coming through.
- What?

09:08.247 --> 09:09.236
Oh.

09:09.315 --> 09:10.543
(GASPS)

09:10.650 --> 09:12.083
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:12.251 --> 09:15.812
So, listen, I need to buy a gift
for my boss' birthday.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.517
Something nice. Just, please,
don't spend my entire paycheck.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.218
I will come up with something.

09:21.294 --> 09:25.628
Okay, cool, I'll come back by later.
Gotta quell a mutiny at work. Bye.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.824
Bye.

09:28.668 --> 09:31.364
- Excuse me.
- He's cute, huh?

09:31.771 --> 09:34.137
- But he was buying a gift for someone.
- Oh, please,

09:34.206 --> 09:36.436
like Mouth's dating his boss.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.313
You... You like the crew, right?

09:45.117 --> 09:48.052
- The crew?
- Yeah. You know, the guys at work.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.489
If by "like," you mean "loathe."

09:52.058 --> 09:54.549
I think you'd really like them
if you got to know them.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.754
And I know they'd like you.

09:57.663 --> 10:00.894
Right, like that's what I'm gonna do,
go have beers with Harry.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.629
- It's Jerry.
- Exactly.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.841
See you at the office.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.316
I'm coming in, Daddy.

10:23.389 --> 10:26.825
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need your water wings, fishface.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.223
All right.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.522
- Got it? Okay.
- Yes.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.360
Style points for a big splash.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.900
Let's see what you got, Jimmy Jam.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.533
Oh, perfect ten. Perfect ten, buddy.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.174
- Come on, Nanny Carrie.
- Hold on.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.051
Perfect ten, huh, Dad?

10:57.356 --> 10:58.618
Throw me, Daddy.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.352
Hey, Jamie, your dad has to do his rehab.

11:00.426 --> 11:01.916
That's okay. Come here, you little monkey.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.586
- You ready?
- Yep.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.392
- You splashed me.
- So?

11:07.633 --> 11:09.726
So. Not so fun now, huh?

11:09.802 --> 11:12.202
Wow. Splashing a little kid, huh?

11:12.271 --> 11:14.501
You got a problem with that?
Let's see what you got.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.167
- Get her, Daddy.
- Yeah, get me, Daddy.

- It's okay, Mama's here.
- No, I want my other mama.

- Good morning.
- Not really.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.080
Can I fix you some breakfast?

12:34.153 --> 12:36.781
No, thanks.
I'm thinking I might drop a few pounds.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.324
Oh, come on, you look great.

12:39.825 --> 12:40.951
Yeah.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.355
Where's Jamie?

12:44.430 --> 12:47.422
With Skills,
and Nathan's at physical therapy.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.631
So you'll just have to deal
with all this nice peace and quiet.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.228
Thought I might go for a quick swim.

12:53.672 --> 12:59.110
Carrie, I don't wanna
sound weird about this,

12:59.178 --> 13:03.012
but could you not wear
a bikini in the pool?

13:04.650 --> 13:07.380
Oh, my gosh. Of course. I'm so sorry.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.921
It just seemed kind of inappropriate,
you know?

13:09.989 --> 13:12.719
- Around Jamie.
- You know, you're absolutely right.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.919
It was poor judgment on my part.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.519
That's okay, and, you know,
everything else is great.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.894
- You're really doing a wonderful job.
- Thanks, Haley.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.662
I appreciate that and I am so sorry.
It won't happen again.

13:23.903 --> 13:26.838
- It won't happen again.
- I'm serious, Mother.

13:27.406 --> 13:31.206
Peyton was really upset
and, anyway, this is my money.

13:31.443 --> 13:34.879
So just stop.
I don't understand why you act like this.

13:34.947 --> 13:38.883
Why? Well, let's see.
I'm staying in a motel.

13:39.451 --> 13:42.818
We have models that are a size four
that should be a size zero,

13:42.888 --> 13:45.015
my daughter's hell-bent
on destroying her company...

13:45.090 --> 13:47.422
Okay, first of all,
I'm not destroying anything.

13:47.493 --> 13:52.396
And second, zero is not a size.
Our models are tall.

13:52.531 --> 13:53.998
Tall and fat.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.397
Maybe you should go back to New York.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.430
I mean, if you're this unhappy here.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.607
You have my word, all right?

14:06.679 --> 14:11.412
I won't meddle in Peyton's
so-called record label.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.573
Thank you.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.448
What I will not do, however,

14:14.520 --> 14:18.012
is hold my tongue when I think
you're making a mistake.

14:18.257 --> 14:21.454
- Now, eat your breakfast.
- Oh, I don't know if I should.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.427
I am a size four, after all.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.225
But you're not a model,
you're my daughter.

14:26.298 --> 14:30.359
Far too talented to waste your life
as a model. So eat.

14:34.106 --> 14:38.839
<i>(SINGING)</i>
<i>But you were with another man, yea!</i>

14:38.911 --> 14:40.208
<i>I know we</i>

14:40.279 --> 14:43.373
<i>ain't got much to say</i>

14:43.449 --> 14:48.045
<i>Before I let you get away, yea!</i>

14:48.120 --> 14:50.179
<i>Uh, be my girl</i>

14:50.256 --> 14:52.315
<i>Be my girl</i>

14:52.925 --> 14:59.125
<i>Are you gonna be my girl, yea</i>

14:59.198 --> 15:00.563
(WHOOPING)

15:05.638 --> 15:07.196
Nice work, kid.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.203
You halfway to sleeping in a van
and checking into rehab.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.074
- Daddy's in rehab.
- Different kind of rehab.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.370
What other kind is there?

15:16.482 --> 15:18.541
You wanna go to the river court?

15:22.955 --> 15:25.082
Did you know my Grandpa Dan?

15:26.859 --> 15:29.089
Yeah, I think we'll go the river court.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.724
Uncle Skills, how come
they sent my grandpa away?

15:44.043 --> 15:45.943
It's clean, I promise.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.807
You told Jamie my dad went to prison
because he didn't clean his room?

15:48.881 --> 15:50.405
Look, man, I was stuck.

15:50.482 --> 15:54.077
I mean, he come up to you
with those baby seal eyes, like...

15:55.054 --> 15:57.682
I mean, he just gets you all confused, man.

15:57.756 --> 16:00.122
You're supposed to play dumb,
not scare the hell out of him.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.023
Okay, look, I panicked, all right?

16:02.094 --> 16:05.063
And, anyway, man,
I don't like lying to him.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.997
Nate, you gotta talk to him.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.362
We need to talk.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.300
Did you tell Lindsey
that you don't like her?

16:15.374 --> 16:17.672
- Kind of.
- What the hell, Peyton?

16:18.277 --> 16:20.837
- She's been nice to you.
- Okay, in case you haven't noticed,

16:20.913 --> 16:23.746
I have a few other problems to deal with
right now. Do you see this office?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.341
This big, empty office
for a label with no artists?

16:26.418 --> 16:28.682
Oh, you mean the label Lindsey
recommended I help you with?

16:28.754 --> 16:31.086
Okay, I can't do this right now.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.557
- You have to apologize to her.
- Luke, Mia is missing. Okay?

16:34.626 --> 16:38.619
Brooke's mom is killing me.
I quit my job, I move back home

16:39.198 --> 16:41.428
and I can't do this right now.

16:43.402 --> 16:44.926
- Can I help you?
- No.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.701
No, you cannot help me.
That is the last thing that I want.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.706
Go home to your girlfriend, Luke, please.

16:56.615 --> 16:57.741
Okay.

17:17.935 --> 17:21.838
What's so important Coach
gotta see me on the weekend for, man?

17:22.808 --> 17:25.800
Well, well. Mrs. James Scott.

17:26.244 --> 17:27.269
(LAUGHS)

17:27.346 --> 17:30.213
- Have a seat, Q.
- All right.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.180
So, Mrs. Scott here
says that you recently left her class

17:37.256 --> 17:41.249
despite the threats of receiving
a failing grade for the quarter.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.652
Yeah, that was just
a little misunderstanding.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.424
But it's all good now, right, Mrs. J. S?

17:46.498 --> 17:49.956
No, Quentin, I warned you about that
and I'm gonna stand by it.

17:50.035 --> 17:51.093
Ooh.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.505
But I do know how important
basketball is to you,

17:54.573 --> 17:57.770
so I figured out a way
for you to make up your grade.

17:57.843 --> 18:01.244
This book is called <i>Les Misérables.</i>
Do you know it?

18:03.182 --> 18:06.777
Good, I'm glad. Now you can read it
over the course of the year,

18:06.852 --> 18:09.286
turn in bi-weekly book reports
for extra credit,

18:09.354 --> 18:13.688
and as long as you meet your deadlines,
you'll remain eligible to play.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.483
And if I don't?

18:15.928 --> 18:20.160
I'm not gonna give preferential treatment
to any student in my class.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.163
What do you say, Q?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.565
Do we have a deal?

18:29.174 --> 18:30.539
I'll think about it.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.004
That's a great move.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.641
Shame no one's gonna see it this year
unless you read the book.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.345
My gosh, man, what is this?
Bad cop, dumb cop?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.911
Now, I said I'd think about it.
What's it to you, anyway?

18:43.989 --> 18:46.287
Well, it matters to Haley,
so it matters to me.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.918
She tends not to give up on people
as easily as I do.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.928
Or maybe wifey's just a little afraid

18:50.996 --> 18:53.021
I'm about to break
her man's scoring record, huh?

18:53.098 --> 18:55.396
So she assigned me some crap book
'cause she know I won't do it.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.866
Well, here's the problem with that theory.

18:56.935 --> 19:00.098
You're not good enough
to beat my scoring record.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.237
- Right, you don't think so?
- No.

19:03.575 --> 19:04.599
Okay.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.371
See, there's one thing
that every great player has,

19:06.445 --> 19:10.142
and that's the will to do
whatever it takes to be the best.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.476
I don't see that in you, Q.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.486
And at this point,
you don't even have a team, so,

19:15.554 --> 19:17.988
maybe you should think about that.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.215
And what team you got, washout? Huh?

19:22.361 --> 19:25.296
You so great, right? Where your team at?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.955
I have a team.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.503
Every day I wake up
and I put on the uniform.

19:31.970 --> 19:35.406
Mistakes, regret, what could have been.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.877
And if could go back and change all that
just by reading a book,

19:39.945 --> 19:42.072
trust me, I'd read the book.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.346
And if not,

19:45.551 --> 19:47.746
well, welcome to the team, Q.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.260
(GRUNTING)

20:04.036 --> 20:07.335
Yeah, that's good. And I could do
a whole line of T-shirts with slogans like,

20:07.406 --> 20:10.967
- "Zero's not a size."
- And "My mom hates all my friends."

20:11.243 --> 20:13.768
Hey, she's not horrible all the time.

20:13.845 --> 20:18.282
You haven't been around for the last
couple of years. She cares about me.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.419
- Brooke Penelope Davis.
- I'll be in the back.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.618
Did you schedule a conference call
with Macy's?

20:24.690 --> 20:27.420
- Yeah, 'cause I was thinking...
- Well, don't.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.289
In case you have to hear it,
you have zero business sense.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.091
- Mom.
- Let me finish.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.365
For the last three years,
I've been calling the shots

20:34.433 --> 20:36.025
and look how this company has grown.

20:36.101 --> 20:40.094
You're a talented designer, Brooke,
but you don't spin the straw into gold.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.264
I do.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.202
Truth be told,
you're not smart enough to do it.

20:54.319 --> 20:58.779
Hey, ice queen.
Stop being such a bitch to your daughter.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.255
And did my daughter pay you to say that?

21:01.326 --> 21:03.260
No, I came up with that one for free.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.820
Well, I advise you keep
your little underachieving mouth shut

21:06.898 --> 21:09.662
because my relationship with
my daughter is none of your business.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.102
No, it is when you tear her down
and call her stupid.

21:13.171 --> 21:17.608
See, the truth is, you're actually worried
she's smart and that's a threat to you

21:17.676 --> 21:21.203
because when she figures out how to do
the business side of this company,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.770
goodbye, Victoria.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.076
You're one to talk.

21:24.149 --> 21:26.947
Once I convince Brooke
that you're just another leech

21:27.019 --> 21:30.648
sucking off the money teat,
you'll be broke and worthless.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.524
I meant what I said.
Stop tearing down your daughter.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.258
She might have to bite her tongue
with you because you're her mother,

21:37.329 --> 21:40.423
- but you are not mine.
- No, I am not.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.334
As a matter of fact,
it's quite clear you never had a mother.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.531
Yeah? Neither did Brooke.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.096
- Oh, my gosh. Lucas, I didn't...
- It's okay.

22:19.304 --> 22:22.603
Lindsey, will you marry me?

22:24.776 --> 22:26.004
Say, "No."

22:27.946 --> 22:30.471
That's what I did when he asked me.

22:33.618 --> 22:36.815
- Did you fall asleep?
- Yeah, I guess.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.121
Well, you'd better get ready.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.853
We're having dinner
with Nathan and Haley, remember?

22:41.927 --> 22:44.293
Oh, yeah. All right.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.876
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.316
Well, I mean, yeah,
I think she knows my position.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.948
So, we all heard.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.618
You're in line for the on-air reporter job.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.658
It's because you stood up to her,
that's why.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.558
- She must respect that.
- I don't know. I...

23:19.931 --> 23:23.025
What's with the powwow?
Can we get back to work?

23:23.335 --> 23:27.465
You get back to work. You hag.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.503
Whoever you are, you're fired.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.712
Security!

23:39.751 --> 23:41.116
(GRUNTING)

23:44.523 --> 23:46.991
(SIGHING)
Where the hell's my cane? Haley?

23:49.828 --> 23:53.889
Hey, have you seen my...
Oh, where's Haley?

23:54.633 --> 23:57.067
I think she ran out
for some last-minute dinner stuff.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.695
I told her I'd do it, but she wanted to.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.296
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.401
Okay,

24:05.210 --> 24:08.407
so are we not supposed
to wear pants tonight?

24:08.480 --> 24:09.640
Funny.

24:10.315 --> 24:14.411
I think I overdid my rehab
and so now I'm having a little trouble.

24:14.553 --> 24:17.181
This might not be
the most appropriate job for you.

24:17.255 --> 24:20.088
Stop it. Nannies are like doctors.

24:20.592 --> 24:23.755
You let your doctor see you like this,
don't you?

24:24.095 --> 24:27.030
That depends on where
he takes me to dinner.

24:28.166 --> 24:32.830
You know, Haley asked me
not to wear a bikini in the pool.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.538
She said it was
inappropriate around Jamie.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.716
There you go. You good?

24:46.084 --> 24:47.210
Yeah.

24:47.886 --> 24:51.322
Listen, Carrie, I'm sure that
Haley didn't mean anything by it.

24:51.389 --> 24:56.691
- I mean, I know she likes you.
- Yeah. It's just kind of ironic, you know?

24:57.662 --> 25:02.326
I mean, if she's worried about someone
getting turned on out at the pool,

25:03.435 --> 25:06.336
she probably
shouldn't let you go shirtless.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.470
So, what's going on with your writing,
Luke? How's it coming?

25:15.547 --> 25:17.981
Good, actually. I'm kind of on a roll lately.

25:18.049 --> 25:21.541
- Oh, you gotta be loving that, Linds.
- The editor side of me is.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.383
The girlfriend side misses her boyfriend.

25:23.455 --> 25:24.752
LUKE: Aw.

25:24.823 --> 25:28.122
- So how's physical therapy, Nate?
- Pretty good, man.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.928
I'm sore a lot these days. I've been
spending a lot of time in the pool.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.931
Yeah, he's been looking
really good in there.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.058
- His rehab's going great.
- Yeah.

25:37.936 --> 25:41.599
- Where's your head, Hales?
- Quentin.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.305
I gave him a second chance
to kind of turn things around

25:44.376 --> 25:47.504
- and I'm not sure if he's gonna take it.
- He will if he wants to play.

25:47.579 --> 25:49.706
Well, sometimes you just
don't know about people.

25:49.781 --> 25:52.875
I mean, I gave Peyton
a second chance and she didn't take it.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.181
Okay, I have to tell you,
I felt so horrible about that

25:55.253 --> 25:58.552
and I know Peyton did too. Victoria has
literally been driving Peyton crazy.

25:58.623 --> 26:01.421
Thanks, but there's more to it than that.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.256
Peyton feels like she has
some sort of jurisdiction over Lucas

26:04.329 --> 26:05.921
- because of their history.
- Yeah.

26:05.997 --> 26:08.932
I was really hoping
it wouldn't be an issue, but clearly it is.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.262
Lindsey,

26:11.570 --> 26:14.801
- Peyton's got a big heart.
- Yeah, to go along with her big mouth.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.234
I know I went to an lvy League school,

26:16.308 --> 26:18.503
but if she keeps it up,
she's gonna get her ass kicked.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.440
- HALEY: Okay, easy.
- Wow.

26:20.879 --> 26:24.474
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
I know she's a friend of yours.

26:24.549 --> 26:27.882
- I just wanted her to like me.
- Yeah, it sounds like it.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.182
What's so funny?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.154
I'll tell you what's not funny,

26:35.226 --> 26:37.194
the fact that you're down here
instead of upstairs sleeping

26:37.262 --> 26:40.595
- like you're supposed to be.
- I'm not tired.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.733
- I'll get him.
- No, I got it.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.031
Jamie, bed. Now.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.831
- Daddy, can you take me?
- Jamie,

26:48.907 --> 26:50.898
you gotta listen to your mother, okay?
Now go on upstairs.

26:50.976 --> 26:53.740
We'll be up there
in a couple of seconds to tuck you in.

26:53.812 --> 26:55.074
(SIGHING)

26:56.348 --> 26:58.748
- He is so cute.
- And he uses it, trust me.

26:58.817 --> 27:00.182
- Yeah.
- And now he's scared to death

27:00.251 --> 27:02.276
- to go to bed because of Dan.
- Yeah, but can you blame him?

27:02.354 --> 27:05.755
I mean, hell, I had nightmares
about Dan till I was, what, 19?

27:07.859 --> 27:09.884
- You think we should go talk to him?
- Yeah.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.326
Excuse us.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.023
Hey, and you are not allowed
to clean at all, okay?

27:14.099 --> 27:16.226
You just make Lucas do it.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.426
(EX CLAIMS)

27:18.370 --> 27:19.735
All right.

27:20.505 --> 27:22.564
All right. Cheers, ladies.

27:23.274 --> 27:27.472
- So, Carrie, how's everything going?
- Really good.

27:29.914 --> 27:34.078
By the way, I completely agree
with what you said about Peyton.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.814
Just because someone
has a history with a person

27:36.888 --> 27:39.789
doesn't mean that's
who they should be with.

27:46.665 --> 27:51.102
- Hey, buddy, I've been looking for that.
- It keeps me safe from Grandpa.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.494
(HALEY SIGHING)

27:53.772 --> 27:58.971
Baby, listen, we try to protect you
from things because we love you

27:59.044 --> 28:02.878
and that's why we didn't tell you
the truth about Grandpa Dan.

28:03.181 --> 28:08.642
The truth is he did some bad things
and he needed to go away.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.778
- Is he ever gonna come back?
- Maybe, someday.

28:13.725 --> 28:16.626
But no matter what,
you're always gonna be safe with us.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.324
Mommy and Daddy are never gonna let
anything happen to you. Okay?

28:20.398 --> 28:21.558
Okay.

28:23.201 --> 28:28.264
But just in case, can you maybe
check in the closet and under the bed?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.668
Yeah, I think so.

28:33.344 --> 28:38.213
This is pretty nice, P. Sawyer.
Fully-stocked bar steps from your office,

28:38.283 --> 28:41.116
complete with a hot bartender,
might I add.

28:42.253 --> 28:43.311
Oh.

28:45.523 --> 28:47.423
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.260
Sorry to bother you.
Can I get an autograph?

28:50.328 --> 28:51.420
- Yeah.
- It's Amy.

28:51.496 --> 28:52.622
Okay.

28:54.699 --> 28:55.927
Thanks.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.158
Well, okay.

28:58.536 --> 29:03.337
So aside from noticing hot bartenders,
how has your love life been?

29:03.408 --> 29:04.432
No comment.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.773
She sleeps around a lot,
but there's no one special.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.336
- You can be fired, you know that?
- Yeah,

29:09.414 --> 29:12.076
but then she'd just come work for me
and you'd still be paying her.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.948
Okay, I'm not calling myself famous
or anything,

29:15.019 --> 29:19.149
but the celebrity makes it a little hard
to meet somebody you can trust.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.623
(DOORBELL RINGING)

29:21.693 --> 29:23.285
Oh, I'll get it.

29:24.729 --> 29:27.823
- Well, all right.
- Everything all right, guys?

29:27.899 --> 29:30.390
Oh, poor thing.
We all have stuff we're afraid of.

29:30.468 --> 29:32.402
- You know I'm deathly afraid of clowns?
- Shut up.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.995
No, I swear to God, it's really sad.

29:36.508 --> 29:40.672
Hey, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted
to say I've been thinking about it

29:40.745 --> 29:43.942
and I'll do whatever it takes
to remain eligible.

29:44.349 --> 29:48.149
- I'm really glad to hear that.
- All right, 6 a.m. Practice, Q.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.015
Yes, sir.

29:51.890 --> 29:55.155
I guess I'll leave y'all to it.
I got a book I gotta start reading.

29:55.226 --> 29:56.853
I'll see you out.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.797
- Way to go, Coach.
- All right.

30:06.337 --> 30:09.329
- You made the right decision.
- I'm coming for that scoring title

30:09.407 --> 30:11.967
and when I'm done, I'm gonna erase you.

30:12.043 --> 30:14.477
Yeah, that's what I would've said.

30:21.953 --> 30:23.887
- Oh, that looks good.
- Thank you.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.855
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.090
- So you guys ready to go?
- Yeah.

30:31.262 --> 30:35.221
- Hot Bartender Guy coming this way.
- Told you he couldn't resist.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.326
Brooke Davis?
Could you maybe sign this for me?

30:38.770 --> 30:40.931
Who should I make it out to?

30:41.072 --> 30:44.940
You can make it out to Tric for $37.
It's your bar tab.

30:47.212 --> 30:49.544
I thought you were
asking for my autograph.

30:49.714 --> 30:51.204
Not really an autograph kind of guy,

30:51.282 --> 30:54.445
especially when I have no idea
who the person is.

30:54.686 --> 30:58.122
Brooke Davis.
I have a line called Clothes Over Bro's.

30:58.189 --> 31:01.818
- Clothing.
- More of a T-shirt and jeans guy.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.722
- Maybe if your name was Levi Strauss.
- Right.

31:04.963 --> 31:08.899
My name is Peyton.
I actually... I have an office right in there.

31:08.967 --> 31:12.926
- This is Millicent, and you know...
- Brooke, right?

31:13.004 --> 31:15.097
- Yeah.
- She makes clothes, apparently.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.198
- Yes.
- Well, I'm Owen.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.636
Let me know if you want my autograph.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.483
- Nice work, B. Davis.
- Shut up.

31:27.685 --> 31:29.277
- Let's go.
- Okay.

31:33.124 --> 31:35.786
You know what?
I'm gonna meet you at home.

31:36.494 --> 31:37.722
So hot.

31:44.002 --> 31:45.970
I'm sorry I disappeared.

31:46.104 --> 31:49.301
I just needed time to think
about everything and, honestly,

31:49.374 --> 31:53.504
I don't think I'm the one to do all this with,
to start your label with.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.603
Why, 'cause you're scared?

31:56.281 --> 32:00.718
Because I don't think I'm ready
and I know how important it is to you.

32:01.486 --> 32:05.047
Okay, Mia, why do you write songs?

32:05.723 --> 32:08.521
- What do you mean?
- Like, when you think about your career,

32:08.593 --> 32:11.323
what do you want?
What's gonna be enough?

32:12.363 --> 32:13.830
I don't know.

32:14.165 --> 32:17.601
All right, maybe you're right,
maybe you're not ready.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.200
I wanna help someone.

32:24.208 --> 32:26.472
I wanna reach that girl or that boy
who wakes up one day

32:26.544 --> 32:28.808
and feels like it's not worth it anymore.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.815
- Why, 'cause you've been that person?
- Maybe.

32:32.617 --> 32:37.554
It's like, I don't need to be famous and I
don't need all the money in the world.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.484
It's not about that.

32:39.557 --> 32:42.287
It's about that girl
who's having a horrible day

32:42.360 --> 32:46.524
and she hears your song and for five
minutes there's hope, you know?

32:48.232 --> 32:53.067
It's like, for five minutes, the world's
not such a scary place for her anymore.

32:54.005 --> 32:57.463
You asked what's gonna be enough?
That'll be enough.

32:57.775 --> 32:59.902
That'll be more than enough.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.004
Okay.

33:04.515 --> 33:07.882
I take it back. Maybe you are ready.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.685

33:37.015 --> 33:39.950
Mom, I know this has all
been really hard on you,

33:40.018 --> 33:42.646
but I just need you to trust me, okay?

33:43.855 --> 33:47.586
And no matter what happens,
I just wanted to tell you that

33:50.228 --> 33:53.891
I love you and I appreciate you

33:55.066 --> 33:58.331
and maybe I don't say that enough.

34:00.938 --> 34:05.272
Of course I trust you, honey.
More than that, I love you.

34:06.377 --> 34:11.337
And I am so proud of you.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

been really hard on you,

but I just need you to trust me, okay?

I just wanted to tell you that

35:17.682 --> 35:21.311
I love you and I appreciate you

35:22.587 --> 35:25.920
and maybe I don't say that enough.

Whatever. You can lock up.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.226
Saw your light on.

36:08.833 --> 36:12.667
Which isn't that surprising.
I mean, I know how hard you work.

36:14.839 --> 36:20.539
You know,
you haven't been yourself lately, Peyton.

36:21.145 --> 36:22.703
I mean, not the Peyton I remember.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.977
Well, I haven't been that Peyton
for three years.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.745
What's going on?

36:30.922 --> 36:32.048
Okay.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.024
I went by my old house.

36:35.893 --> 36:41.957
There's a teenage girl living there now
and she showed me my closet door.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.460
And you know what that said?

36:45.336 --> 36:48.203
"Lucas and Peyton. True Love Always."

36:49.540 --> 36:52.839
Always, Lucas.
That's what we were supposed to have

36:53.144 --> 36:57.672
until you showed up in LA
three years ago and ambushed me.

36:57.748 --> 37:00.182
If by "ambushed"
you mean "proposed" to you.

37:00.284 --> 37:02.650
Oh, yeah, out of the blue.

37:03.087 --> 37:06.614
A proposal that was driven by
some insecurity

37:06.691 --> 37:08.989
that I have never been able to understand.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.290
Insecurity? Right.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.931
Let me tell you
how you get "always," Peyton.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.900
When a man asks you to marry him,
you say, "Yes."

37:18.970 --> 37:21.131
You don't say, "No" and call him insecure.

37:21.205 --> 37:23.298
I never said, "No"!

37:24.342 --> 37:28.210
I said that I loved you and that I did
wanna marry you someday.

37:28.279 --> 37:31.771
And, oh, God, Luke, I wanted you so bad.

37:33.851 --> 37:36.411
- But you gave up on us.
- I gave up on us?

37:36.487 --> 37:38.819
- Yes!
- By proposing, I gave up on us?

37:38.889 --> 37:43.326
No, by not waiting you gave up on us
and you know that's the truth.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.225
That's great, Peyton.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.864
You wanna talk truth, let's tell the truth.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.164
- Okay.
- You gave up on me.

37:52.637 --> 37:56.232
That's why you didn't say, "Yes."
You didn't think I could do it.

37:56.307 --> 37:59.401
You didn't think
I could get my novel published.

37:59.543 --> 38:03.001
Maybe you just didn't care
because it wasn't about you,

38:03.681 --> 38:06.115
- or what you wanted.
- Well, if that's the truth,

38:06.183 --> 38:11.746
if I never cared, then how come
every time I see this stupid book I buy it?

38:11.822 --> 38:14.290
Every stupid damn time, Luke!

38:14.959 --> 38:18.725
You said I was great!
You said I could be great!

38:18.796 --> 38:20.889
You said we were destined to be together!

38:20.965 --> 38:23.024
You said it to the world, you said it to me,

38:23.100 --> 38:26.866
and I wish you never had
because you did not mean any of it.

38:27.738 --> 38:28.966
Oh, God.

38:30.441 --> 38:31.465
I'm gonna go.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.602
Okay, you know what? I wanna pay rent.
I don't know how I'm gonna do it,

38:34.679 --> 38:36.078
but I'll figure it out, I just...

38:36.147 --> 38:39.514
Whatever this is, I don't feel right about it.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.218
- It's called me being nice to you.
- Well, it needs to stop.

38:44.288 --> 38:46.813
You know, maybe you're right.

Night, buddy.

39:44.081 --> 39:45.878

39:50.721 --> 39:53.246
Actually, I'm not feeling very well.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.854

on-air material after all.

start getting sick on me.

40:03.968 --> 40:08.905
I'm sure it's nothing. I'll get a good
night's rest and be back to normal.
