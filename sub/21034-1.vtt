02:49.600 --> 02:52.202
There are
three kinds of people in the world.

02:53.837 --> 02:55.539
Those who make it happen,

02:57.708 --> 02:59.477
those who watch it happen,

03:01.745 --> 03:06.650
and those who spend their lives
asking, "What happened?"

03:36.246 --> 03:38.449
I understand you arrived
in only this morning.

03:38.482 --> 03:39.817
Yes, sir.

03:39.850 --> 03:40.894
Well then, let me assure you

03:40.918 --> 03:43.654
you will never get used to
the heat and the sand.

03:43.687 --> 03:46.457
There really is no escaping it at all.

03:46.490 --> 03:49.292
Ghastly stuff as you can see.

03:49.326 --> 03:52.430
Although, around 5 p.m.
it does start to cool

03:52.463 --> 03:53.263
this time of year.

03:53.296 --> 03:55.533
You can feel it.
It's like clockwork.

03:55.566 --> 03:59.737
One must simply learn to
live with it, unfortunately.

03:59.770 --> 04:02.773
Nonetheless, here we are.

04:06.444 --> 04:07.811
Where did you study?

04:07.845 --> 04:08.846
At Oxford.

04:08.879 --> 04:11.515
Ah, yes! Oxford.

04:11.549 --> 04:14.752
Well, I dare say it's
a trifle greener than Cairo.

04:14.785 --> 04:16.487
Not as many goats.

04:21.559 --> 04:23.461
I do apologize for
notifying your superiors.

04:23.494 --> 04:25.429
It's such short notice.

04:25.463 --> 04:28.466
This situation came
about rather suddenly.

04:28.499 --> 04:32.370
The timing of your arrival
is most fortunate indeed.

04:32.403 --> 04:36.574
I appreciate this will not be
pleasant for you, my dear.

04:36.607 --> 04:40.878
However, we'll get you out
of the ward for a few days.

04:40.911 --> 04:44.314
And good experience in
the field never goes astray.

04:44.348 --> 04:49.753
You will find his medical
records in the file.

04:53.524 --> 04:54.492
He's German.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.360
I thought we were looking
for one of our own.

04:56.394 --> 04:57.861
We are, my dear.

04:57.895 --> 05:01.365
Captain Josef Von Zimmermann
of the elite German Uberkanone,

05:01.399 --> 05:04.535
has been working for us quite some time.

05:04.568 --> 05:07.605
You'll note he does not
speak any English.

05:07.638 --> 05:09.940
Frightful-looking chap.
Don't be alarmed.

05:09.973 --> 05:13.477
Fortunately, he's one of us now.

06:21.679 --> 06:24.515
One of our pilots spotted
a downed aircraft

06:24.548 --> 06:29.019
in the desert about uh,
100 miles East this morning.

06:29.052 --> 06:31.722
He is carrying sensitive information

06:31.755 --> 06:33.991
smuggled out of Germany.

06:34.024 --> 06:38.929
It is the highest priority that
we find him and bring him in.

06:38.962 --> 06:40.998
Do we know if he's alive?

06:41.031 --> 06:43.434
We're not even certain it is our man.

06:47.004 --> 06:49.272
He has quite a record, I dare say.

06:49.306 --> 06:50.741
Regrettably he's been responsible

06:50.774 --> 06:53.477
for shooting down a number of our lads,

06:53.511 --> 06:56.847
making him one of Germany's finest,

06:56.880 --> 06:58.616
but such is war.

08:05.516 --> 08:07.951
We tend to send out our grounded pilots

08:07.985 --> 08:10.354
on these sorts of rescue operations.

08:10.388 --> 08:12.890
Keeps them occupied until
they get back into the air.

08:12.923 --> 08:14.858
The captain whom you
will be accompanying,

08:14.892 --> 08:16.594
has been briefed.

08:16.627 --> 08:20.664
He is a rather unorthodox chap.

08:48.592 --> 08:50.661
What was he grounded for?

08:50.694 --> 08:52.930
Well, I'm sure you'll have
plenty of time

08:52.963 --> 08:55.065
to ask him that yourself, my dear.

09:04.141 --> 09:05.409
That's him?

09:05.443 --> 09:08.045
Yes, my dear.
Don't be alarmed.

09:28.231 --> 09:29.400
Captain.

09:33.136 --> 09:34.938
Captain Jackson Cove.

09:36.974 --> 09:39.743
I'd like you to meet Eleanor Morgan.

09:39.777 --> 09:41.945
She will be accompanying you
on your mission.

09:49.587 --> 09:50.854
I thought I was going alone.

09:50.888 --> 09:53.332
Yes. Well,
we received orders from Christland

09:53.356 --> 09:55.559
that someone with medical
training accompany you.

09:55.893 --> 09:59.162
If our man is out there alive,
Eleanor here,

09:59.196 --> 10:02.232
will be more than capable of
tending to his medical needs.

10:02.265 --> 10:03.634
Great.

10:04.935 --> 10:07.004
Eleanor is fluent in German,

10:07.037 --> 10:10.508
so she will be acting
as your interpreter.

10:10.541 --> 10:11.809
Yeah.

10:11.842 --> 10:14.044
We were very lucky
that she was available.

10:14.077 --> 10:16.647
So be a nice chap and
take good care of her.

10:18.782 --> 10:20.918
You drive?

10:20.951 --> 10:22.085
Yes, sir.

10:25.889 --> 10:28.058
Captain.

10:28.091 --> 10:29.091
Eleanor.

10:36.266 --> 10:37.535
Grab those, will you?

10:39.269 --> 10:40.938
Surely you're not serious!

10:43.941 --> 10:44.941
Captain.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.080
Captain!

13:41.084 --> 13:42.084
You're stopping?

14:00.003 --> 14:01.805
Know anything about navigating?

14:03.173 --> 14:05.943
No. Not much.

14:05.976 --> 14:08.211
Not much or nothing at all?

14:08.245 --> 14:09.245
Nothing.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.815
All right. Look here.

14:11.849 --> 14:13.484
- You see this?
- Uh-hm.

14:13.517 --> 14:16.454
That's where we are.
You see this?

14:16.487 --> 14:17.455
- Uh-hm.
- Okay.

14:17.488 --> 14:18.989
That's where they think he is.

14:19.022 --> 14:21.091
So, we're going to
drive in a straight line,

14:21.124 --> 14:25.863
114 miles that way, North by Northeast.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.297
You see this compass?

14:27.330 --> 14:29.433
That's North by Northeast, okay?

14:29.467 --> 14:31.301
And we also need to
keep track of our speed

14:31.334 --> 14:33.070
and we need to watch our hours.

14:33.103 --> 14:37.408
So it's 1900 right now,
and we're here, okay?

14:37.441 --> 14:43.347
At 2000, we work out
distance equals speed over time.

14:43.381 --> 14:44.482
You understand that?

14:44.515 --> 14:45.383
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

14:45.416 --> 14:47.184
That's how we calculate our position,

14:47.217 --> 14:51.822
and that's how...
That's how we find him.

14:51.855 --> 14:54.091
And that's navigating, all right?

14:54.124 --> 14:56.894
We watch our compass,
we keep track of our speed,

14:56.927 --> 15:00.398
and we watch our time or we'll get lost.

15:00.431 --> 15:04.001
If we get lost, we run out of water.

15:04.034 --> 15:07.004
We run out of water, we die.

15:15.479 --> 15:16.980
How do we know our speed?

15:17.014 --> 15:19.249
This thing does 25 miles an hour.

15:19.282 --> 15:22.252
- Is that fast?
- Yeah, it's pretty fast.

15:22.285 --> 15:24.888
Is a mile longer or shorter
than a kilometer?

15:29.960 --> 15:31.920
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

15:33.564 --> 15:35.132
Jesus Christ!

15:43.206 --> 15:46.043
You should try and
get some sleep, all right?

15:46.076 --> 15:47.945
We'll stop just before sun-up.

15:47.978 --> 15:48.978
Yes, sir.

16:12.302 --> 16:13.404
Oh my God, Cove.

16:24.615 --> 16:25.583
Captain!

16:25.616 --> 16:27.618
Oh! Ouch!

16:31.889 --> 16:34.558
You're drunk!

16:34.592 --> 16:36.093
Maybe a little.

16:36.126 --> 16:38.128
I though we were under attack.

16:38.161 --> 16:39.930
I thought you were shot.

16:39.963 --> 16:41.565
What is wrong with you?

16:41.599 --> 16:43.333
Oh, come on!

16:43.367 --> 16:45.569
You frightened the life out of me!

16:50.273 --> 16:53.110
It's just a little desert trap shooting.

16:53.143 --> 16:56.614
Oh, that's just bloody wonderful!

16:56.647 --> 16:58.982
It's a disgrace!

16:59.016 --> 17:02.620
No wonder
they wouldn't let you fly!

17:02.653 --> 17:07.290
Hey, my flying has got
nothing to do with my drinking.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.429
Give me that before you kill somebody.

17:11.462 --> 17:13.296
You want to be careful.
It's loaded.

17:13.329 --> 17:15.198
Oh, thank you very much, Captain,

17:15.232 --> 17:17.334
for pointing out the blooming obvious.

17:26.577 --> 17:27.877
I'm driving.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.916
It doesn't count if you're sober.

17:38.088 --> 17:39.088
Bastard!

17:40.123 --> 17:41.559
That was a nice shot.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.101
I'm good.

17:53.437 --> 17:54.438
I'm good.

17:55.739 --> 17:58.576
Shouldn't take yourself
so seriously, Oxford.

18:14.658 --> 18:15.959
Time.

18:15.993 --> 18:17.628
Needle.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.130
Speed.

18:20.163 --> 18:21.298
Bastard!

18:49.092 --> 18:52.262
* Make her drive the truck I tell ya *

18:52.295 --> 18:55.399
* Make her drive the truck
through the desert *

18:55.433 --> 18:58.469
* Make her drive the truck
through the desert *

18:58.502 --> 19:01.705
* Early in the morning *

19:01.739 --> 19:08.579
* Ooh rise up she's rising
early in the morning *

19:57.528 --> 19:58.528
Captain.

20:03.867 --> 20:06.437
Uh, Captain!

20:07.638 --> 20:10.374
"Oh, Captain, my captain."

20:13.677 --> 20:15.713
Hey, Eleanor.

20:15.746 --> 20:17.481
R-uh-uh-uh-uhn!

20:22.420 --> 20:23.654
Women...

20:23.687 --> 20:25.556
The other way!

20:37.868 --> 20:39.837
You all right?

20:39.870 --> 20:41.339
I think so.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.446
Where you going?

20:48.479 --> 20:49.480
Stay down!

20:50.848 --> 20:52.750
What are you doing?

20:54.852 --> 20:57.788
Have a little fun, boys.

21:04.327 --> 21:07.164
Oh God!

21:08.832 --> 21:10.701
I'm going to need your help.

21:10.734 --> 21:12.770
- What is it?
- It's a scotch bomb.

21:12.803 --> 21:15.373
It didn't detonate.

21:15.406 --> 21:17.475
Will he come back?

21:17.508 --> 21:19.677
Uh, I doubt it.

21:19.710 --> 21:21.445
It's probably just a leftover.

21:21.479 --> 21:22.446
What's a leftover?

21:22.480 --> 21:24.748
Ah, you always keep one
just in case you see

21:24.782 --> 21:27.150
a sitting duck you can pick off
on the way back.

21:27.184 --> 21:28.652
Well, will it explode?

21:28.686 --> 21:30.854
Uh, they usually do.

21:30.888 --> 21:31.889
Oh God!

21:31.922 --> 21:33.524
Well, we can't just leave it.

21:33.557 --> 21:35.893
Oh, no, and the slightest vibration

21:35.926 --> 21:37.861
is going to trigger it.

21:37.895 --> 21:41.264
We are going to have to defuse it.

21:41.298 --> 21:44.502
And that is a two-man job.

21:44.535 --> 21:45.836
Well, I'm not a bomb expert.

21:45.869 --> 21:49.740
Don't worry.

21:49.773 --> 21:50.708
Neither am I.

21:50.741 --> 21:52.876
Oh God!

22:25.643 --> 22:27.283
Please tell me you know
what you're doing.

22:29.447 --> 22:31.682
I've seen a bomb like this once before.

22:31.715 --> 22:34.284
- Once?
- Once was enough.

22:34.317 --> 22:38.321
The guy defusing it ended up legless.

22:38.356 --> 22:39.623
Oh my God!

22:41.459 --> 22:43.394
Don't worry.

22:43.427 --> 22:46.997
Supposedly there's
instructions on the inside

22:47.030 --> 22:48.999
that tell us how to disarm it.

22:49.032 --> 22:52.703
Can we not use the term
"disarm," please?

22:52.736 --> 22:55.005
We're going to need to crack it open.

22:55.038 --> 22:56.407
Hand me the pliers.

23:00.611 --> 23:03.280
Probably just like operating
on a patient, right?

23:03.313 --> 23:06.984
You know, only difference here
is you make a mistake,

23:07.017 --> 23:10.554
the patient doesn't die... you do.

23:30.874 --> 23:33.577
There we go.

23:33.611 --> 23:35.579
All right.

23:35.613 --> 23:37.881
I'm going to need you
to hold the base of this.

23:37.915 --> 23:39.450
- Oh!
- Go on, hold it.

23:39.483 --> 23:40.451
Right at the bottom.

23:40.484 --> 23:41.419
Just grab it.
Get in here.

23:41.452 --> 23:43.587
Get a good grip on it.

23:43.621 --> 23:44.988
Nice and tight.

23:45.022 --> 23:46.724
Yeah.

23:46.757 --> 23:48.025
Firm.

23:48.058 --> 23:49.427
Just like that.

23:53.931 --> 23:55.499
Here we go.

24:08.746 --> 24:10.881
Hey, Eleanor?

24:10.914 --> 24:12.550
Uh-hm.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.418
You can let go now.

24:17.888 --> 24:18.922
Read these.

24:22.860 --> 24:27.064
One, remove liquid container.

24:27.097 --> 24:31.469
Two, release the cap.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.506
Three, drain liquid.

24:43.981 --> 24:45.383
Ah!

24:49.420 --> 24:51.489
Scotch bomb!

24:55.092 --> 24:58.095
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:58.128 --> 25:00.097
Have you been out here so bloody long

25:00.130 --> 25:02.833
you've got sand between your ears?

25:02.866 --> 25:04.802
God!

25:04.835 --> 25:08.406
There's a man lying out there somewhere,

25:08.439 --> 25:11.709
possibly dying, and you're
buggerising around

25:11.742 --> 25:14.645
thinking about only yourself
and your addiction.

25:14.678 --> 25:19.383
God! You are nothing but
a washed-up drunk!

25:19.417 --> 25:22.620
I just hope we're not
two minutes too late to save him

25:22.653 --> 25:24.030
because it's you who's
going to be looking back

25:24.054 --> 25:25.523
at this time that you've wasted

25:25.556 --> 25:26.524
that could have been better spent

25:26.557 --> 25:30.594
saving a life rather than
drinking it away!

25:32.796 --> 25:34.865
You know whose life it is

25:34.898 --> 25:37.468
we're out here supposedly saving?

25:37.501 --> 25:38.736
Yes.

25:38.769 --> 25:39.903
Do you?

25:39.937 --> 25:41.147
- Yes.
- Do you?

25:41.171 --> 25:43.173
- Yes!
- Do you really?

25:43.206 --> 25:45.743
Josef von Zimmermann.

25:45.776 --> 25:50.013
Captain Josef von Zimmermann,
the...

25:50.047 --> 25:53.584
Germany's top ace.
You heard of him?

25:53.617 --> 25:55.453
- Well!
- Well?

25:55.486 --> 25:58.856
Did you hear that
Captain Josef Von Zimmermann

25:58.889 --> 26:02.693
has singlehandedly
shot down 27 Allied planes

26:02.726 --> 26:06.730
and has 23 confirmed kills,
and did you hear

26:06.764 --> 26:10.100
that one of those 23
confirmed kills was my brother?

26:10.133 --> 26:12.870
Yeah? Well,
how many have you killed?

26:15.205 --> 26:16.440
I'm sorry.

26:17.941 --> 26:18.941
Yeah.

26:23.714 --> 26:27.117
So I'm sorry if I'm not
in any rush to find him.

26:38.496 --> 26:39.763
I didn't know.

26:41.031 --> 26:43.066
I know you didn't know.

26:54.945 --> 26:56.046
Oh, no thanks.

26:56.079 --> 26:57.448
I don't smoke.

27:01.985 --> 27:03.487
How long has it been?

27:06.724 --> 27:07.825
Six months.

27:09.159 --> 27:10.528
Older brother?

27:10.561 --> 27:11.695
Younger.

27:14.898 --> 27:17.200
He shouldn't have been out here.

27:17.234 --> 27:18.234
Ace?

27:21.572 --> 27:22.606
Almost.

27:26.043 --> 27:27.043
Were you close?

27:31.281 --> 27:33.116
As close as brothers are.

27:38.989 --> 27:43.594
You know, just because von Zimmermann's

27:43.627 --> 27:45.563
a switch-hitting batter
for both sides

27:45.596 --> 27:47.898
doesn't change anything.

27:47.931 --> 27:50.901
He doesn't deserve to live.

27:50.934 --> 27:54.137
You're... you're not thinking about...

27:54.171 --> 27:55.315
You're not thinking you're going to...

27:55.339 --> 27:56.674
Kill him?

28:08.218 --> 28:12.690
I've seen so many men die in hospitals.

28:12.723 --> 28:14.858
I guess we're just
simply taught to care.

28:17.861 --> 28:20.230
I don't see anyone as good or bad.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.933
I just see them as men...

28:22.966 --> 28:24.735
brothers...

28:24.768 --> 28:28.706
with children, families.

28:28.739 --> 28:30.574
We just do our best to aid them.

28:35.913 --> 28:37.548
Is this why you were grounded?

28:40.050 --> 28:42.052
No.

28:42.085 --> 28:43.186
Come on.

28:43.220 --> 28:44.955
Share.

28:44.988 --> 28:47.057
I crashed too many planes.

28:47.090 --> 28:48.359
What?

28:48.392 --> 28:49.927
I crashed too many planes!

28:49.960 --> 28:51.304
What do you mean
"you crashed too many planes"?

28:51.328 --> 28:53.163
I mean, pilots crash all the time.

28:53.196 --> 28:56.166
Yeah, not when they're drunk.

28:56.199 --> 28:59.136
All right. Well... well,
how many are we talking?

28:59.169 --> 29:00.904
Enough to get me grounded.

29:03.907 --> 29:05.042
Why do you do it?

29:05.075 --> 29:06.009
What? Drink?

29:06.043 --> 29:07.310
Fly.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.048
I don't know.

29:13.851 --> 29:18.255
I guess it's that thing
da Vinci said, you know,

29:18.288 --> 29:21.925
"Once you've tasted flight,
you'll forever walk the earth"

29:21.959 --> 29:27.230
with your eyes turned skyward
because there you've been

29:27.264 --> 29:29.367
"and there you will always
long to return."

29:29.400 --> 29:31.769
That's beautiful.

29:31.802 --> 29:33.904
I never heard anything like that.

29:33.937 --> 29:36.840
Ah, come on, Oxford.

29:36.874 --> 29:38.208
I thought you were educated.

29:38.241 --> 29:40.844
I am, thank you very much.

29:40.878 --> 29:42.012
I know who da Vinci is.

29:42.045 --> 29:44.682
That's good.

29:44.715 --> 29:46.016
What about you?

29:46.049 --> 29:51.288
- Educated?
- No! No! Nope.

29:51.321 --> 29:54.057
I left school when I was 13.

29:54.091 --> 29:56.226
Injury ended my baseball career,

29:56.259 --> 30:00.297
so, military was all
that was left really.

30:00.330 --> 30:05.369
If it wasn't for flying,
I don't know what I'd do.

30:05.403 --> 30:07.037
Do you think it has a future?

30:09.740 --> 30:12.142
Pilots don't think much
about their future.

30:12.175 --> 30:14.812
Yeah, I guess not many
of us do these days.

30:14.845 --> 30:15.846
And you?

30:15.879 --> 30:19.049
Me? Oh, I don't know.

30:19.082 --> 30:20.951
I just like helping people.

30:23.186 --> 30:24.988
At least what you do is exciting.

30:25.022 --> 30:29.693
Yeah, well, the girls love it.

30:29.727 --> 30:31.194
Oh.

30:31.228 --> 30:33.697
Aw, come on.

30:33.731 --> 30:37.134
You think we just fly up there

30:37.167 --> 30:40.404
risking our lives every day
for fun, huh?

30:40.438 --> 30:42.205
No.

30:42.239 --> 30:44.775
Ninety-nine percent of us
are just pilots

30:44.808 --> 30:46.176
to get the girls.

30:46.209 --> 30:49.312
Oh yeah,
and you're in the 99%, are you?

30:49.347 --> 30:50.280
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

30:50.313 --> 30:52.916
Maybe I am.

30:52.950 --> 30:55.453
Maybe I'm a one-percenter.

30:55.486 --> 30:56.587
Oh, wow.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.956
If you figure that out,
perhaps you'll let me know.

32:42.493 --> 32:43.293
We used to drop them down

32:43.326 --> 32:45.829
on the boys in the western front.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.932
Those scotch bombs.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.002
After a mission, whoever of us was left

32:52.035 --> 32:55.272
would drop one down to
the boys in the trenches.

32:55.305 --> 32:56.840
It became kind of a tradition.

32:56.874 --> 32:57.951
You know, sort of a good luck thing

32:57.975 --> 33:00.578
to let those boys know
we were thinking about them.

33:00.611 --> 33:03.381
We fly back to the base
every night, get drunk,

33:03.414 --> 33:06.283
sleep in a bed if we want.

33:06.316 --> 33:08.519
Those boys down there,
they didn't have that.

33:08.552 --> 33:11.389
They were just in those sewers fighting,

33:11.422 --> 33:12.456
day in and day out.

33:12.490 --> 33:16.594
So those scotch bombs
became a way for us pilots

33:16.627 --> 33:19.630
to recognize that, you know,

33:19.663 --> 33:22.165
and lay away some of the guilt, I guess.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.869
They would love it.

33:25.903 --> 33:29.540
You could hear the cheers
sometimes after we dropped them.

33:31.909 --> 33:33.549
It certainly helped
keep their spirits up.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.383
Is that an American attempt at humor?

33:39.417 --> 33:41.419
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:41.452 --> 33:43.454
"Keeping their spirits up"?

33:43.487 --> 33:47.190
Aw, come on. Even you got to
admit that was kind of funny.

33:47.224 --> 33:48.659
That was kind of funny.

33:48.692 --> 33:50.361
There you go.
I can be funny.

33:53.397 --> 33:54.432
Yeah.

33:56.299 --> 33:59.903
I've never seen a woman
handle a pistol as good as you.

33:59.937 --> 34:01.180
Where the hell did you learn to shoot?

34:01.204 --> 34:03.040
My father.

34:03.073 --> 34:04.608
He was a gun-maker.

34:04.642 --> 34:06.944
He still around?

34:06.977 --> 34:09.513
Dead.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.215
That's why I hate guns.

34:12.248 --> 34:15.918
- Yours?
- Ah, he's dead, too.

34:15.953 --> 34:18.221
That's why I lo-v-v-ve flying.

34:19.422 --> 34:21.058
Two of a kind.

34:21.091 --> 34:23.326
Nah. He was a drunk.

35:14.044 --> 35:17.280
It's 114 miles according
to your calculations.

35:17.314 --> 35:18.516
Mark it.

35:30.794 --> 35:31.962
Here.

35:36.734 --> 35:39.537
Nah, still too hot.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.730
We're going to have to wait
until the heat haze clears.

36:10.801 --> 36:14.071
I hope we didn't come
all this way for nothing.

36:14.104 --> 36:15.773
We'll find him.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.805
Captain!

36:47.838 --> 36:49.573
I think I sight something.

37:02.886 --> 37:05.523
That could be it.

37:05.556 --> 37:06.556
Let's go.

37:40.458 --> 37:41.492
What do you think?

37:41.525 --> 37:43.427
Let's get a little closer.

38:23.434 --> 38:25.202
Anything?

38:25.235 --> 38:26.904
There's something out there.

38:26.937 --> 38:29.206
Nah, it's too hard to make out.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.645
Get out of the way.

38:39.783 --> 38:40.651
Sure doesn't look like

38:40.684 --> 38:43.754
much of an aircraft down there if it is.

38:43.787 --> 38:45.889
Doesn't look like anybody
could have survived.

38:45.923 --> 38:46.923
You sure?

38:48.359 --> 38:50.828
I've crashed enough airplanes to know.

38:54.297 --> 38:55.842
No, I just don't want to get down there

38:55.866 --> 38:57.868
and find out it's nothing.

39:00.538 --> 39:01.639
We have to look.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.476
Yeah, we do.

39:07.578 --> 39:09.613
You get your gear ready
while we still got light.

39:23.293 --> 39:24.395
I'll be damned!

39:29.266 --> 39:31.369
Watch yourself.

39:31.402 --> 39:32.402
Yes, sir.

39:45.583 --> 39:48.719
Stay behind me.

39:48.752 --> 39:50.488
Just stay behind me!

39:50.521 --> 39:52.322
Yes, sir.

40:00.063 --> 40:01.532
Can you see anything?

40:01.565 --> 40:02.700
Not yet.

40:07.471 --> 40:08.639
- That's him!
- Wait a minute!

40:16.914 --> 40:17.914
Is he dead?

40:19.016 --> 40:20.818
I don't know.

40:21.785 --> 40:23.987
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait! Drop it!

40:24.021 --> 40:25.022
Drop the gun!

40:27.024 --> 40:28.392
All right! All right!

40:32.095 --> 40:33.397
All right!

40:47.110 --> 40:48.512
What's he saying?

40:50.080 --> 40:51.682
Your pistol.

41:32.956 --> 41:34.458
Fuck!

41:55.413 --> 41:56.880
Fuck!

42:50.233 --> 42:51.569
Fuck!

49:40.878 --> 49:43.381
Think, think, think.

50:16.480 --> 50:17.881
Where are they going?

50:29.259 --> 50:30.561
I hate Egypt!

53:05.716 --> 53:06.717
That is...

53:10.621 --> 53:12.022
one mile!

54:27.865 --> 54:29.400
Josef!

58:36.079 --> 58:42.753
* I wonder who's looking into her eyes *

58:42.786 --> 58:48.091
* Breathing sighs telling lies *

58:56.667 --> 58:59.601
There you go. Sleep now.

59:01.572 --> 59:09.079
* I wonder if she ever tells him of me *

59:11.081 --> 59:16.554
* I wonder who's kissing her now *

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:13.904
Helluva storm, eh, little man?

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:28.586
Well, make yourself comfortable.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:32.956
I think we're going to be here a while.

01:04:00.438 --> 01:04:01.939
Don't get thirsty!

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:08.746
We're not doing too well here,
are we little man?

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.351
Me and you, we're going to be lucky

01:04:13.384 --> 01:04:16.354
to make it to tomorrow.

01:04:16.387 --> 01:04:19.022
Nine crashes.

01:04:21.492 --> 01:04:24.762
This ain't really the heroic end
I had in mind.

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:35.806
I always imagined
I'd be shot out of the sky...

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:38.876
Splattered all over the ground.

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:42.045
It may have been
on your list, little man,

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:46.183
but killing a Sunday roast

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:49.720
certainly wasn't on my list
of good ways to die.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.821
You will never
get used to the heat and sand.

01:05:23.854 --> 01:05:26.490
There really is no escaping it at all.

01:05:26.524 --> 01:05:30.227
Ghastly stuff as you can see,
although around 5 p.m.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.363
it does start to cool this time of year.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.141
You wouldn't know
a good way out of here,

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:45.308
would you, little man?

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.457
You're a genius, little man.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:08.799
Batter up.

01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:20.378
Who said we needed
wings to fly, huh, little man?

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:20.037
Wherever we've been,
it won't be long to return.

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.509
We're not dying
in this dust-bowl, little man.

01:07:25.543 --> 01:07:26.977
No way.

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:32.443
I don't know about you,
little man, but I feel better.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.041
All right.

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.542
Throttle.

01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:07.277
Stick.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.612
Good.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:09.747
Fuel.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:10.981
Oil pressure.

01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:14.618
Guns.

01:09:14.652 --> 01:09:17.154
And a broken compass.

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.187
Perfect.

01:09:53.424 --> 01:09:56.827
All right. I've checked everything.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.196
What have I missed?

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:01.699
What have I missed in here, huh?

01:10:22.386 --> 01:10:25.122
German engineering, huh, little man?

01:10:25.155 --> 01:10:27.257
Who knows?

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:32.496
All right. Throttle, and here we go.

01:10:36.367 --> 01:10:37.367
All right.

01:11:13.804 --> 01:11:16.407
There.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.186
Come on now!

01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:31.154
Here we go!

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:35.926
Here we go. Come on!

01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:42.132
Come on!

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.172
Come on!

01:11:52.209 --> 01:11:54.712
Yeah!

01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:56.447
Yeah! Whoa!

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.582
We got it, little man!
Yeah!

01:12:00.818 --> 01:12:02.486
Whoa, whoa!

01:12:54.472 --> 01:12:55.873
Yeah!

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.746
Yeah!

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.849
Faint-hearted never
fucked a fair maiden!

01:13:05.883 --> 01:13:07.284
Woo!

01:14:39.443 --> 01:14:40.478
Eleanor!

01:15:39.570 --> 01:15:40.570
Oh shit!

01:16:02.526 --> 01:16:03.526
Damn it!

01:16:05.195 --> 01:16:07.798
Eleanor!

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:14.405
Cove?

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:22.680
You have nothing also.

01:16:22.713 --> 01:16:24.214
Eleanor, stay down.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.917
He's got a clean shot at you.

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.085
I'm all right!

01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:34.224
Oxford!

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.493
I'm all right!

01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:45.636
You have this.

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:50.841
Just stay right where you are.

01:16:56.914 --> 01:17:00.684
Two birds, one stone.

01:17:17.701 --> 01:17:21.839
Oh, don't worry, I feel right at home.

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:27.177
We'll see about that.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:30.914
Nor!
What are you shooting at?

01:17:57.775 --> 01:17:59.209
Can you free yourself?

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:00.644
I need time.

01:18:00.678 --> 01:18:02.212
You don't have any!

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:03.981
Eleanor, stay down. Stay down!

01:18:18.896 --> 01:18:19.930
Eleanor!

01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:30.273
Oxford!

01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:35.579
Oxford...

01:18:38.749 --> 01:18:40.317
Eleanor!

01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:14.718
Boom!

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:23.661
Oh, I'm going to kill him!

01:19:23.694 --> 01:19:25.363
I'm going to kill him!

01:19:34.438 --> 01:19:36.974
So much for switching sides.

01:19:37.007 --> 01:19:39.176
Oh, come on!

01:20:15.012 --> 01:20:16.947
Good-bye, Captain.

01:25:06.069 --> 01:25:08.271
For an ace, you should know better.

01:25:08.305 --> 01:25:10.608
That's twice now you didn't
check on your kill.

01:25:34.532 --> 01:25:39.337
You stay with me, Eleanor.
Stay with me now.

01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:41.739
Who did you signal for?

01:25:41.772 --> 01:25:43.641
Nor, who was the flare for?

01:25:58.121 --> 01:26:00.391
He wants your clothes.

01:26:00.424 --> 01:26:01.492
Do as he says.

01:26:04.395 --> 01:26:07.030
It's over!
They're coming.

01:26:07.064 --> 01:26:08.331
Who?

01:26:08.366 --> 01:26:09.700
The Germans.

01:26:09.733 --> 01:26:10.634
Tell him it's not too late.

01:26:10.668 --> 01:26:12.503
Tell him we could still
get him to Cairo.

01:26:12.536 --> 01:26:14.381
I thought we were on
the same team, for God's sake.

01:26:14.405 --> 01:26:15.673
- Tell him!
- I have!

01:26:15.706 --> 01:26:16.707
Tell him again!

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.221
It's not too late.
Come on!

01:26:37.695 --> 01:26:41.565
He says
he'll never betray his country.

01:26:41.599 --> 01:26:42.700
Which one?

01:26:48.406 --> 01:26:49.673
This is nuts!

01:27:43.794 --> 01:27:45.696
A DR-1 single-seater.

01:27:57.375 --> 01:28:01.111
Looks like he's not planning
on taking back any passengers.

01:29:23.994 --> 01:29:25.963
I can get us out of here.
Come on.

01:29:25.996 --> 01:29:27.531
Oh, come on, Eleanor.

01:29:27.565 --> 01:29:29.833
You've got to help me.
Get up. Get up!

01:29:32.936 --> 01:29:33.936
Eleanor!

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.510
It's over.

01:29:39.543 --> 01:29:41.912
No, no. Come on.

01:29:41.945 --> 01:29:43.313
We're getting you back to Cairo.

01:29:43.347 --> 01:29:45.549
Come on.
Come on now.

01:29:48.386 --> 01:29:50.988
No! No!

01:29:51.021 --> 01:29:52.289
No!

01:29:55.459 --> 01:29:56.460
No!

01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:28.919
Big cannon, my ass!

01:31:35.926 --> 01:31:38.328
That worked!

01:31:48.439 --> 01:31:51.375
There are three kinds
of people in this world.

01:31:51.409 --> 01:31:53.844
Those that make it happen,,

01:31:53.877 --> 01:31:56.347
those that watch it happen...

01:32:00.651 --> 01:32:03.354
And those that go,
"What happened?"

01:32:12.596 --> 01:32:13.731
Captain.

01:32:13.764 --> 01:32:15.433
Sir.

01:32:15.466 --> 01:32:17.134
Well, don't get up.

01:32:17.167 --> 01:32:19.403
I wasn't planning on it.

01:32:19.437 --> 01:32:23.607
I gather...
You're recovering well.

01:32:23.641 --> 01:32:25.643
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

01:32:25.676 --> 01:32:28.679
That bunker you destroyed
was a strategic installation

01:32:28.712 --> 01:32:31.482
being prepared for
aerial assaults on Cairo.

01:32:31.515 --> 01:32:33.517
The fueling station they constructed,

01:32:33.551 --> 01:32:37.621
put German aircraft within
easy reach of our forces here.

01:32:37.655 --> 01:32:41.992
More importantly,
the information you discovered

01:32:42.025 --> 01:32:44.462
was of extreme value.

01:32:44.495 --> 01:32:45.596
Was it now?

01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:46.697
In fact it was.

01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:48.198
It was a detailed list

01:32:48.231 --> 01:32:50.167
identifying all German operatives

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.169
working across Europe.

01:32:52.202 --> 01:32:56.807
I understand you may have
actually known one of them.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.008
Eleanor Morgan.

01:33:01.912 --> 01:33:02.880
Oxford?

01:33:02.913 --> 01:33:07.985
Born Margrit Almajaeger,
in Germany, in 1889.

01:33:08.018 --> 01:33:09.620
She had been sent to Cairo

01:33:09.653 --> 01:33:13.991
specifically to intercept and
substitute the information

01:33:14.024 --> 01:33:16.760
that Captain von Zimmermann
was carrying.

01:33:16.794 --> 01:33:19.863
Most likely when he came in
for medical treatment.

01:33:19.897 --> 01:33:23.066
Quite a clever plan,
when you think about it.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:27.705
Of course, it all changed
when we sent you out there.

01:33:27.738 --> 01:33:32.175
Your efforts have been
noted in my reports.

01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:35.513
I have made commendations for you.

01:33:35.546 --> 01:33:37.615
Excuse me, sir.

01:33:37.648 --> 01:33:39.550
Yes, yes, of course.
Carry on.

01:33:41.885 --> 01:33:44.054
Is that more comfortable, Captain?

01:33:44.087 --> 01:33:46.824
Yeah, thanks.

01:33:46.857 --> 01:33:51.194
I trust our fine medical staff
are looking after you well.

01:33:51.228 --> 01:33:54.932
We need you in tip-top condition
as soon as possible.

01:33:54.965 --> 01:33:58.001
Headquarters have reinstated
you to active flying duty.

01:33:59.637 --> 01:34:01.539
Recover well, Captain.

01:34:01.572 --> 01:34:02.606
Yes, sir.

01:34:04.274 --> 01:34:05.509
Very good.

01:34:25.796 --> 01:34:28.165
I know, I know, little man.

01:34:29.833 --> 01:34:31.068
Batter up.

01:34:34.905 --> 01:34:37.040
You don't speak any German, do you?

01:34:37.074 --> 01:34:38.709
No, sir.

01:34:43.881 --> 01:34:45.148
Perfect.
