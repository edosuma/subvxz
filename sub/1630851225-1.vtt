WEBVTT

00:28.721 --> 00:31.223
Okay.

00:32.391 --> 00:35.327
Okay, it's just 50 minutes.

00:36.629 --> 00:39.666
Worst thing that happens

00:39.699 --> 00:41.868
is you walk in.

00:44.436 --> 00:46.639
Okay, okay.

00:46.673 --> 00:50.542
Just do it, just walk in,
just go in.

00:50.575 --> 00:52.779
One, two, three, go.

01:22.775 --> 01:25.544
If you had to use three words
to describe yourself,

01:25.577 --> 01:26.813
what would they be?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.282
Um...

01:34.453 --> 01:36.022
Disappointment.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.993
Um...

01:43.930 --> 01:45.665
Burden.

01:50.837 --> 01:53.405
Failure.

01:53.438 --> 01:56.676
How often do you remind yourself
of those words?

01:56.709 --> 01:58.577
Every day.

01:59.812 --> 02:01.613
And do you truly believe

02:01.647 --> 02:04.382
that you are
any of these things?

02:04.416 --> 02:05.450
Yes.

02:09.756 --> 02:11.657
You said that college

02:11.691 --> 02:13.626
was the happiest time
of your life.

02:13.659 --> 02:15.393
Yeah.

02:15.427 --> 02:18.497
Would you mind
expanding on that?

02:18.530 --> 02:20.666
What was that like?

02:22.735 --> 02:25.537
In college, you're invincible.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.774
Nothing can break you.

02:27.807 --> 02:30.509
Invincible.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.678
Why is that?

02:35.580 --> 02:37.817
Because I had my friends.

02:39.518 --> 02:43.689
And I had goals, plans.

02:45.658 --> 02:49.361
And that is
a very deadly combination.

02:49.394 --> 02:51.363
Deadly how?

02:51.396 --> 02:54.366
It creates a blanket.

02:54.399 --> 02:55.701
Blanket.

02:55.735 --> 02:58.403
Is writing this much normal?

02:58.436 --> 02:59.839
Yes.

03:05.144 --> 03:06.145
Um...

03:06.179 --> 03:09.381
I'm sorry, I don't remember
what I was...

03:09.414 --> 03:10.817
A blanket?

03:13.653 --> 03:16.722
Do you, uh, do you mind
if we, uh, stop for today?

03:16.756 --> 03:19.959
I'm just feeling kind of tired.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.694
Plus, I got to start packing.

03:21.727 --> 03:23.395
I usually procrastinate
these things

03:23.428 --> 03:25.064
till I'm halfway out the door.

03:25.097 --> 03:28.100
Packing for what?

03:28.134 --> 03:30.535
My old roommate sent me a letter

03:30.569 --> 03:32.571
inviting us all up
to his lake house this weekend.

03:32.604 --> 03:34.674
Big news.

03:34.707 --> 03:36.943
I didn't even know Roger moved.

03:36.976 --> 03:39.145
Well, enjoy yourself.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.579
I will.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.482
- Zach?
- Yeah?

03:45.651 --> 03:48.120
How are they healing?

03:53.960 --> 03:56.428
Yeah, I decided to go.

03:56.461 --> 03:57.797
I don't know,
I haven't seen them

03:57.830 --> 03:58.998
in, like, five years.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.567
I'm sure it'll be a very
unsurprising weekend with them.

04:04.136 --> 04:06.605
What I mean is,
as soon as I see Gil,

04:06.639 --> 04:08.808
he's inevitably
going to piss me off.

04:08.841 --> 04:10.152
Rowan will pretend
that James and her

04:10.176 --> 04:11.744
have a picture-perfect life,

04:11.777 --> 04:13.155
and she'll try to coerce us
into joining

04:13.179 --> 04:14.714
her weird fitness cult.

04:14.747 --> 04:17.549
Andy and Roger will screw
because they're bored,

04:17.582 --> 04:19.719
and Zach will cry.

04:19.752 --> 04:22.154
Just like old times.

04:22.188 --> 04:24.824
Why am I going, again?

04:40.840 --> 04:43.508
It's three days.

04:48.848 --> 04:50.182
Logan?

04:50.216 --> 04:52.985
Logan! Oh my god, Logan!

04:54.552 --> 04:56.989
Oh, I missed you so much!

04:57.023 --> 04:59.491
- Hey, Rowan.
- All I do is tell James

04:59.524 --> 05:01.193
how much I want
to come visit you.

05:01.227 --> 05:02.862
- You guys should.
- I wish,

05:02.895 --> 05:05.031
but now I've got seven clients
at a time.

05:05.064 --> 05:06.699
Every season is wedding season.

05:06.732 --> 05:08.768
I don't remember
the last time we traveled.

05:08.801 --> 05:10.535
- Well, you look great.
- Pilates and yoga

05:10.568 --> 05:11.837
three times a week,

05:11.871 --> 05:14.606
and I just started
a kickboxing class.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.175
- Wow.
- It wasn't always that easy,

05:16.208 --> 05:17.944
but once I changed my diet,
it's like I have

05:17.977 --> 05:20.545
this entirely different
perspective, you know?

05:20.578 --> 05:21.948
Did you want to join my company?

05:21.981 --> 05:24.684
'Cause it is the best decision
I have ever made.

05:24.717 --> 05:26.152
I would love that.

05:26.185 --> 05:29.055
Oh, I missed you so much!

05:29.088 --> 05:31.190
Okay, you have to catch me up
on everything,

05:31.223 --> 05:34.126
you job, dates,
recent TV binges.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.762
- Is anyone else here yet?
- Yeah, it's James and me,

05:36.796 --> 05:40.099
uh, and Zach's here, and Andy.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.634
Oh my god!

05:41.667 --> 05:43.803
-Oh my god!

05:43.836 --> 05:46.238
Oh my god!

05:46.272 --> 05:48.506
Holy shit, I missed you so much!

05:48.540 --> 05:50.810
Oh, look at you, sexy!

05:50.843 --> 05:51.978
Stop, look at your body.

05:52.011 --> 05:54.880
If I had that, I would
literally do everything naked.

05:54.914 --> 05:56.614
Yeah, you'd have to
because my body

05:56.649 --> 05:57.826
would never be caught dead
in that.

05:57.850 --> 05:58.784
What the fuck are you wearing?

05:58.818 --> 06:01.253
- Stop, I know.
- Seriously, is this a cape?

06:01.287 --> 06:02.527
Wait till Gil sees you in that.

06:02.554 --> 06:03.588
He's gonna hate himself.

06:03.621 --> 06:04.957
No, I didn't wear this...

06:04.991 --> 06:06.859
- Mm-hm.
- I didn't.

06:06.892 --> 06:07.970
Our lips are sealed,
don't worry.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.162
No, before I came up,
I had to stop by the office.

06:10.196 --> 06:11.807
My boss is working
on a double homicide case.

06:11.831 --> 06:14.266
- It's so cool.
- I'm bored already.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.168
Come on, I made
some special juice.

06:16.202 --> 06:18.004
We'll go right inside
and enjoy the day.

06:18.037 --> 06:19.939
Andy, it's noon.

06:19.972 --> 06:22.208
Let's go, we're behind schedule.

06:25.044 --> 06:26.912
Come on, you're gonna love it.

06:26.946 --> 06:28.647
I'll get the door, I got it.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.485
If you guys wanted to,

06:32.517 --> 06:34.286
but you get all these classes
together.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.098
I was helping this other bride
the other week.

06:36.122 --> 06:37.722
She ended up needing
to have to change...

06:39.125 --> 06:40.659
- James!
- Logan.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.194
Hi!

06:42.228 --> 06:44.196
- Check my teeth.
- You don't floss enough.

06:44.230 --> 06:45.965
That's so lame, no one does.

06:45.998 --> 06:47.833
It's better than my diagnosis.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.778
He told me I have to get
my wisdom teeth pulled out.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.113
If you don't take care
of your teeth,

06:51.137 --> 06:52.838
no boys will want to kiss you.

06:52.872 --> 06:54.840
And here I thought
you only cared about yourself.

06:54.874 --> 06:56.608
How's the new practice going?

06:56.642 --> 06:57.743
It's pretty cool.

06:57.777 --> 06:58.911
I like being my own boss,

06:58.944 --> 07:00.984
and the dental assistants
pretty much do everything.

07:01.013 --> 07:03.816
Can you believe you need to go
to medical school for teeth?

07:03.849 --> 07:04.860
You know, you make fun of me,

07:04.884 --> 07:06.685
but I had to pass
organic chemistry to get in.

07:06.719 --> 07:07.987
- So?
- So I never saw

07:08.020 --> 07:08.821
any party favors.

07:08.854 --> 07:10.356
I'm gonna get you back for that.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.124
- Is that a promise?
- It's a threat.

07:12.158 --> 07:14.060
Oh, that's even better.

07:16.328 --> 07:20.032
Oh, yes, yes, bring them.

07:20.066 --> 07:22.301
- What? No.
- Yes.

07:22.334 --> 07:25.971
- Shots?
- You're so welcome.

07:26.005 --> 07:29.775
All right, guys,
one, two, three.

07:33.679 --> 07:35.748
Oh, I should've mixed that.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.710
It was the perfect big wedding.

08:04.743 --> 08:06.879
- Yes, it was.
- Hey!

08:06.912 --> 08:08.247
Oh my god!

08:08.280 --> 08:11.183
Hi, Zach!

08:13.052 --> 08:14.386
How are you? How's your fiancÃ©e?

08:14.420 --> 08:17.423
Um, oh, we are drinking already.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.724
What are you having, my friend?

08:18.757 --> 08:20.960
Um, whatever everyone else
is having.

08:20.993 --> 08:23.896
Bad choice. Andy made
some vile concoction.

08:23.929 --> 08:25.231
My special juice.

08:25.264 --> 08:27.299
It's a little early
for that, right?

08:27.333 --> 08:29.835
It's never too early
for my special juice.

08:39.145 --> 08:40.412
Holy shit.

08:40.446 --> 08:42.982
Roger, is that you?

08:43.015 --> 08:44.183
Gil.

08:46.152 --> 08:48.721
You look good.

08:48.754 --> 08:49.998
I mean, I hardly recognized you.

08:50.022 --> 08:51.991
Thanks, I joined a curves.

08:52.024 --> 08:53.425
Somehow, you look even better.

08:53.459 --> 08:55.094
Yeah, well, Seattle air.

08:55.127 --> 08:57.463
I had no idea
that air had an impact

08:57.496 --> 08:59.899
on your getup here, sailor.

08:59.932 --> 09:01.367
Yeah, something
you can't afford.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.904
This is gonna be
a long weekend, isn't it?

09:04.937 --> 09:07.439
Yeah, yeah, but I...

09:07.473 --> 09:12.211
I brought drugs and alcohol
to numb.

09:12.244 --> 09:14.413
Of course you did.

09:21.187 --> 09:22.254
All right.

09:22.288 --> 09:24.156
Oh, fuck!

09:25.357 --> 09:26.458
That was... that was good.

09:26.492 --> 09:28.327
Right here, right here.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.929
- Eyes here.
- Hey!

09:29.962 --> 09:31.173
See what happens
if you listen to me?

09:31.197 --> 09:32.331
You see what happens?

09:37.403 --> 09:40.105
- So why defense?
- I don't know.

09:40.139 --> 09:41.907
It seemed like more
of a challenge, I guess.

09:41.941 --> 09:43.809
- Is it?
- Very.

09:43.842 --> 09:47.112
Yeah, my first case,
he was like a serial rapist.

09:47.146 --> 09:48.447
- Yeah, he was a dick.
- I bet.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.915
Did you prove him innocent?

09:49.949 --> 09:51.517
Can't lose your first case.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.153
- God, I could never do that.
- Oh, you monster.

09:54.186 --> 09:55.020
You don't have a choice.

09:55.054 --> 09:58.123
They teach you
to become indifferent.

09:58.157 --> 10:00.259
It's not... whatever.

10:00.292 --> 10:02.928
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, I am, thank you.

10:02.962 --> 10:05.197
Great. You want to take
my pills too?

10:05.231 --> 10:07.399
They're in the other pocket
if you want.

10:07.433 --> 10:09.068
Nothing gets past you, does it?

10:09.101 --> 10:11.003
- You have pills?
- Yeah,

10:11.036 --> 10:12.514
but they're prescription,
it's all good.

10:12.538 --> 10:15.107
- What is it this month?
- Aw, it's endless.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.810
- Could be worse.
- Yeah, could be worse.

10:19.478 --> 10:21.146
Don't look at me like that.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.214
I didn't say anything.

10:22.248 --> 10:24.850
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

10:24.883 --> 10:27.453
- All right, give me this.
- Come and get it.

10:27.486 --> 10:29.455
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hm.

10:29.488 --> 10:30.923
Grow up, Andy.

10:30.956 --> 10:32.124
Mm, no.

10:32.157 --> 10:34.193
Stop.

10:34.226 --> 10:35.995
Logan, take it, take it!

10:36.028 --> 10:38.030
Oh my god. Oh my god,
leave me out of this!

10:38.063 --> 10:40.165
- Leave me out of this!
- Give me my fucking weed!

10:40.199 --> 10:41.343
- No, no, no, no!
- Give it back.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.902
Stop, ah!

10:45.604 --> 10:48.173
Don't pick on a girl. No.

10:48.207 --> 10:49.208
It's not fair.

10:49.241 --> 10:51.277
Ah, well.

10:51.310 --> 10:54.280
Oh, yes.

10:54.313 --> 10:55.581
Happy?

10:55.614 --> 10:57.182
Yeah, actually.

10:57.216 --> 10:58.284
Pretty happy.

10:58.317 --> 11:00.185
Not gonna lie.

11:01.854 --> 11:04.857
Oh my god, you still have this?

11:04.890 --> 11:07.826
Yeah, obviously, it's awesome.

11:07.860 --> 11:08.762
Does that make me a loser?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.338
- Is that lame?
- I mean, it kind of does.

11:10.362 --> 11:12.498
No fucking way!

11:12.531 --> 11:14.033
That looks like shit.

11:14.066 --> 11:15.377
- What did you do to it?
- You fucking made it!

11:15.401 --> 11:16.235
Walk through the valley

11:16.268 --> 11:17.970
of the shadow of death
in that thing.

11:18.003 --> 11:19.405
Mine looks good.

11:20.939 --> 11:22.341
That was really bad.

11:22.374 --> 11:23.442
It's fine.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.345
Watch this, babe.

11:26.378 --> 11:27.379
Here it is.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.555
I told you not to call me.

11:36.588 --> 11:38.924
Come on, Gil.

11:38.957 --> 11:42.161
Right, I know,
but he is my husband.

11:42.194 --> 11:43.362
We're fine, we're fine.

11:45.097 --> 11:46.532
Yeah, I...

11:46.565 --> 11:48.934
I know.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.637
Yeah, I promise.

11:52.471 --> 11:56.175
Can you just hang tight
for me, please?

11:57.677 --> 11:59.011
All right.

11:59.044 --> 12:00.446
I got to go.

12:00.479 --> 12:02.915
No one saw that.

12:05.384 --> 12:06.418
Boom!

12:06.452 --> 12:09.154
Fuck you! In your mouth!

12:11.323 --> 12:13.292
Gil, it's not as fun

12:13.325 --> 12:14.569
if you're not
a sore loser about it.

12:14.593 --> 12:15.628
Good job, man.

12:15.662 --> 12:16.895
What?

12:16.929 --> 12:18.097
Where the fuck are you going?

12:18.130 --> 12:20.633
Gonna go collect
my consolation prize.

12:20.667 --> 12:24.136
You know, you didn't win, Gil!

12:24.169 --> 12:25.237
This is crazy.

12:25.270 --> 12:26.372
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

12:26.405 --> 12:28.040
- Yeah.
- Logan.

12:28.073 --> 12:29.608
Hey.

12:29.642 --> 12:30.576
- What?
- Let's go.

12:30.609 --> 12:32.679
What? Hey.

12:32.712 --> 12:34.146
No!

12:34.179 --> 12:35.581
Put me down!

12:35.614 --> 12:38.417
No, I was talking to Roger.

12:38.450 --> 12:39.985
I don't... stop running.

12:40.018 --> 12:42.087
- You need some Gil time.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

12:42.121 --> 12:43.555
Don't throw me in the lake!

12:43.589 --> 12:46.392
Now another installment of
america's favorite game show,

12:46.425 --> 12:49.027
will he do it?

12:51.296 --> 12:52.965
Stop.

12:52.998 --> 12:55.702
No, stop. Stop.

12:55.735 --> 12:57.536
Boo! Throw her in the lake!

12:57.569 --> 13:00.372
I want to see betrayal!

13:00.406 --> 13:03.409
I remember
when we were that cute.

13:03.442 --> 13:05.077
Were?

13:05.110 --> 13:07.946
Did you get your joint back?

13:07.980 --> 13:10.048
James, stop, what are you doing?

13:10.082 --> 13:12.951
- I'm being cute.
- James!

13:12.985 --> 13:14.319
I swear to god, put me down.

13:14.353 --> 13:16.689
- I will divorce you!
- Freedom!

13:20.025 --> 13:21.293
Race you down the dock?

13:27.166 --> 13:29.268
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

13:29.301 --> 13:31.170
You want the girl or not, dude?

13:31.203 --> 13:32.504
Come on.

13:37.543 --> 13:39.311
Gil! No!

13:39.344 --> 13:40.344
Gil!

13:44.283 --> 13:45.350
Babe, get in the water!

13:55.160 --> 13:56.261
Zach!

14:00.199 --> 14:01.443
Guys, guys, guys,
he doesn't have to come in

14:01.467 --> 14:02.669
if he doesn't want to.

14:02.702 --> 14:03.712
All right, but at least
let me out

14:03.736 --> 14:06.238
'cause I don't want
to be in here anymore.

14:13.345 --> 14:14.513
Woo!

14:14.546 --> 14:16.415
Zachie boy!

14:17.583 --> 14:19.686
Stop it.

15:40.667 --> 15:44.737
So, I guess I'll start
with the awkward catch-ups

15:44.771 --> 15:47.205
and where are we nows?

15:47.239 --> 15:49.876
I'm currently working
at bar Louie still

15:49.909 --> 15:52.477
and I'm not serving, though.

15:52.511 --> 15:54.847
I am actually the bartender,

15:54.881 --> 15:57.215
and I get to plan the events
sometimes,

15:57.249 --> 15:58.794
- which is pretty cool.
- Doesn't it suck

15:58.818 --> 16:00.019
still living up there, though?

16:00.053 --> 16:03.823
Um, sometimes, but I still get
to go to the football games

16:03.856 --> 16:05.692
and the bars are dirt cheap.

16:05.725 --> 16:07.593
Why did you spend
thousands of dollars

16:07.627 --> 16:09.294
on a criminology degree again?

16:09.328 --> 16:11.597
Oh, okay,
probably the same reason

16:11.631 --> 16:14.867
you took that bullshit PR job
that you didn't want.

16:14.901 --> 16:17.837
I actually got fired
from that bullshit PR job,

16:17.870 --> 16:19.371
so I really wish
I had it right now.

16:19.404 --> 16:21.173
Seriously? When?

16:21.206 --> 16:23.141
Uh, maybe a month ago.

16:23.175 --> 16:25.177
How did Zoey take it?

16:25.210 --> 16:27.145
Oh, yeah.

16:27.179 --> 16:28.389
I guess I should tell you guys.

16:28.413 --> 16:30.482
Um, she's gone, she left me.

16:30.515 --> 16:32.351
- Wait, what?
- Yeah,

16:32.384 --> 16:34.586
maybe like three weeks ago.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.722
I can't really remember.

16:35.755 --> 16:37.456
Oh, Zach.

16:37.489 --> 16:39.759
- Damn, dude.
- Yeah, seriously bad timing.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.593
I was just pissed
she kept the ring.

16:41.628 --> 16:43.462
Cost me a fortune.

16:43.495 --> 16:44.807
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

16:44.831 --> 16:46.365
none of us
really liked her anyway.

16:46.398 --> 16:48.768
That does, that does.

16:48.801 --> 16:50.837
That seriously pisses me off.

16:50.870 --> 16:53.572
I say we track her down,
then kill her.

16:53.605 --> 16:57.744
Normally, I'm not with this,
but I say we just kill her.

16:57.777 --> 16:59.511
How about this? I'll counter.

16:59.544 --> 17:02.581
I'll allow a light keying
of the car I bought her.

17:02.614 --> 17:05.550
- Yay!
- For you, I'll do it.

17:05.584 --> 17:07.452
Do a good job.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.554
But enough about me
and my misfortunes.

17:09.588 --> 17:11.289
Someone else go,
something lighter,

17:11.323 --> 17:14.359
something happier.

17:14.393 --> 17:16.495
Unless you all can top
my misery, I mean...

17:16.528 --> 17:18.296
- Ooh, I can.
- Logan.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.700
Okay, my fiancÃ© left me
five years ago

17:20.733 --> 17:22.501
and now he's sitting
across from me,

17:22.534 --> 17:25.504
so I think
that tops yours easily.

17:25.537 --> 17:27.640
- Wow.
- What?

17:27.674 --> 17:28.751
It always comes back to this,
doesn't it?

17:28.775 --> 17:30.910
- Comes back to what?
- It's been less than four hours

17:30.943 --> 17:31.844
and you're already
starting shit.

17:31.878 --> 17:34.446
- I'm just stating the truth.
- I moved

17:34.479 --> 17:36.381
for a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

17:36.415 --> 17:38.751
- You refused to come.
- You never invited me.

17:38.785 --> 17:40.361
Yeah, well, it looks like
you're doing pretty well

17:40.385 --> 17:41.353
for yourself.

17:41.386 --> 17:44.256
I saw your posts of Fiji.

17:44.289 --> 17:45.725
And what is that
supposed to mean?

17:45.758 --> 17:47.760
It means that you can afford
something like that.

17:47.794 --> 17:49.494
The trip,
your designer clothing,

17:49.528 --> 17:50.906
that watch you're trying
to show off right now.

17:50.930 --> 17:51.631
James and I are trying
to have...

17:51.664 --> 17:52.999
You really didn't even need me.

17:53.032 --> 17:54.967
- Here we go.
- Well,

17:55.001 --> 17:56.703
when you attend Yale university,

17:56.736 --> 17:58.771
ranked number one
in the United States,

17:58.805 --> 18:01.506
and you are number four
of your graduating class,

18:01.540 --> 18:04.443
you tend to get offered
really well-paying jobs

18:04.476 --> 18:07.412
that give you money
to go on said trips

18:07.446 --> 18:08.948
and to buy said
designer clothing

18:08.981 --> 18:11.851
and my $3,000 watch.

18:11.884 --> 18:12.952
You spent three grand?

18:12.985 --> 18:15.988
Yes, I did, Zach.

18:16.022 --> 18:17.757
So while you're still
a fucking intern

18:17.790 --> 18:20.860
up to his elbows in bedpans
and sutures,

18:20.893 --> 18:24.329
I am standing comfortably
six to eight hours a day

18:24.362 --> 18:25.932
in my Louis vuittons.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.401
Did I adequately answer

18:29.434 --> 18:32.604
your condescending
question, Gil?

18:32.638 --> 18:33.940
I did?

18:33.973 --> 18:35.775
Okay.

18:41.013 --> 18:42.982
So are you still
mainly cardio...

18:43.015 --> 18:44.793
Are you still a has-been
English lit professor

18:44.817 --> 18:46.986
that sleeps with his tas?

18:47.019 --> 18:48.988
What?

18:49.021 --> 18:50.022
You do.

18:50.056 --> 18:53.358
Oh, Zach, what?

18:53.391 --> 18:55.594
Five times.

18:55.628 --> 18:57.529
Uh, me and Rowan
are trying to have a baby.

18:57.562 --> 19:00.432
Hey!

19:00.465 --> 19:02.400
- Congrats.
- Thanks, guys.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.402
I can't believe you guys
are starting a family.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.571
Yeah, I'm super stoked
to be a father.

19:06.605 --> 19:07.983
We already got the top names
picked out,

19:08.007 --> 19:09.809
and I'm gonna build
the crib myself.

19:09.842 --> 19:11.409
- Nice.
- We can totally plan

19:11.443 --> 19:13.311
the baby shower, gender reveal,

19:13.345 --> 19:14.046
whatever you guys need.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.547
Slow down.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.616
He said we were trying.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.652
There's no baby.

19:19.685 --> 19:21.620
Not yet.

19:25.091 --> 19:28.593
- I'm gonna head to bed.
- It's, like, 9:00.

19:28.628 --> 19:29.929
- Dude.
- What?

19:29.962 --> 19:31.774
Are you really about to leave
without telling us?

19:31.798 --> 19:32.965
What are you talking about?

19:32.999 --> 19:34.466
Why you brought us here.

19:34.499 --> 19:35.668
The suspense is killing me.

19:35.701 --> 19:36.869
Yeah, Gil.

19:36.903 --> 19:38.905
- What?
- The letter.

19:38.938 --> 19:41.339
The weird letter,
you said you had some big news

19:41.373 --> 19:42.550
and to come up
to your lake house.

19:42.574 --> 19:45.044
- What are you talking about?
- Dude, this is not my house.

19:45.077 --> 19:47.445
- What?
- I received a letter from Logan.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.048
- Logan?
- Wait, what?

19:49.081 --> 19:51.784
Your letter,
it's in my jacket pocket.

19:51.818 --> 19:53.385
Letter? No, no, no.

19:53.418 --> 19:55.620
No, no, I got a letter
and it was from Andy.

19:55.655 --> 19:58.390
No. No, I... that's impossible.

19:58.423 --> 19:59.926
I got mine from Zach.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.661
I got mine from Roger.

20:01.694 --> 20:04.396
Mine is from Logan, so...

20:04.429 --> 20:05.998
Wait, so none of
anyone's letters

20:06.032 --> 20:07.800
- are from James and I?
- Babe, I don't think

20:07.834 --> 20:09.068
that's the big issue here.

20:09.101 --> 20:11.938
No, but admit
it's a little strange.

20:23.582 --> 20:25.685
"Hey, long time, no talk,
stranger.

20:25.718 --> 20:26.551
I miss you."

20:26.585 --> 20:27.419
"I know it's probably
last minute

20:27.452 --> 20:28.496
and asking a lot,
but I'd love it

20:28.520 --> 20:31.023
if you could make it
to my lake house next weekend."

20:31.057 --> 20:32.768
"Oh, yeah, did I tell you
I bought a lake house?

20:32.792 --> 20:34.559
- It's insane."
- "Anyways,

20:34.593 --> 20:36.062
I invited everyone
from the group up.

20:36.095 --> 20:38.664
"I have big, big news
for you all."

20:38.698 --> 20:41.000
"But I better not spoil
anything.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.668
It's gonna be
a hell of a weekend."

20:42.702 --> 20:43.836
"Hope to see you there.

20:43.870 --> 20:46.038
Bring lots of booze.

20:46.072 --> 20:47.039
Yours truly..."

20:47.073 --> 20:48.473
- "Roger."
- "Zach."

20:49.909 --> 20:51.610
What is going on?

20:51.644 --> 20:52.688
Okay, it's probably
just the storm.

20:52.712 --> 20:54.847
- James.
- I'm right here.

20:54.881 --> 20:57.415
Check your phones for service,
you guys got anything?

20:57.449 --> 20:58.727
Guys, it's probably
just the storm.

20:58.751 --> 21:00.485
Would you stop saying that?

21:00.518 --> 21:02.520
Oh my god, it's a fucking ghost.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.456
This house is haunted and...

21:04.489 --> 21:06.591
Andy, get yourself together.
Ghosts aren't real.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.460
Then who wrote us
the fucking letter, Gil?

21:08.493 --> 21:10.471
Maybe something with fucking
hands to write it with?

21:10.495 --> 21:12.064
It has to be someone
we knew in school.

21:12.098 --> 21:13.900
James, we literally had
zero other friends.

21:13.933 --> 21:15.543
Yeah, they wanted in the group,
we didn't let them in,

21:15.567 --> 21:16.645
and now they've been
holding a grudge

21:16.669 --> 21:18.104
and pulling off this shit.

21:18.137 --> 21:19.571
James, that could never happen.

21:19.604 --> 21:21.674
- Nobody liked us.
- Or...

21:21.707 --> 21:23.743
Or it's just one of us
playing a prank,

21:23.776 --> 21:25.711
and if they are,
they've got us really good

21:25.745 --> 21:28.180
and they should totally
just come forward right now!

21:30.082 --> 21:31.483
My vote is still on the ghost.

21:31.516 --> 21:33.485
Andy, ghosts aren't real.

21:33.518 --> 21:34.854
Whose fucking house is this?

21:34.887 --> 21:37.056
Everybody, calm down. Relax.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.959
Way too fucking high
for this right now.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.037
All right, ladies, stay here.

21:42.061 --> 21:44.063
Me and Gil are gonna
check things out in the front.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.666
Zach and Roger, you guys see
what's going on in the barn.

21:46.699 --> 21:48.868
- What?
- Let's go.

21:48.901 --> 21:50.602
Let's go.

21:51.871 --> 21:54.774
"Let's go."

21:54.807 --> 21:56.574
- You ready?
- Yeah.

22:17.630 --> 22:20.733
Dude, this place is huge.

22:22.735 --> 22:25.104
Dude, I'm convinced
we only stayed friends with them

22:25.137 --> 22:26.939
- for the girls.
- What do you mean?

22:26.973 --> 22:28.183
I mean,
have you heard them talk?

22:28.207 --> 22:29.541
It makes me want to kill myself.

22:29.574 --> 22:31.110
That's a given.
Whenever Gil talks,

22:31.143 --> 22:34.213
I want to slit my wrists
with shards of glass.

22:34.246 --> 22:36.082
What do you mean
"for the girls"?

22:40.920 --> 22:43.122
Wow.

22:43.155 --> 22:44.857
Uh, you know, I mean the girls.

22:44.890 --> 22:46.158
You were always into Logan.

22:46.192 --> 22:47.760
I was into Andy.

22:47.793 --> 22:49.795
They came as a package deal,
I mean.

22:49.829 --> 22:52.932
No, dude, I never liked Logan.

22:52.965 --> 22:54.900
You're such an asshole.

22:54.934 --> 22:56.678
I'm just saying I think
we could've spared ourselves

22:56.702 --> 22:59.105
a lot of unnecessary
memories with them

22:59.138 --> 23:00.940
- if we just dealt with that.
- Yeah,

23:00.973 --> 23:03.275
but then you wouldn't get
to tell all these stories.

23:03.309 --> 23:06.645
Oh, yeah, right,
the ones I love telling.

23:06.679 --> 23:08.781
This is actually pretty nuts,
dude.

23:08.814 --> 23:10.058
We should bring
everybody in here.

23:10.082 --> 23:12.752
- This place is massive.
- It's not small.

23:12.785 --> 23:15.154
Basketball hoop too.

23:15.187 --> 23:16.789
I should get everybody
in here, dude.

23:16.822 --> 23:18.257
Insane.

23:20.259 --> 23:22.094
Oh, fuck.

23:23.896 --> 23:25.631
Oh, shit.

23:27.366 --> 23:29.201
Dude.

23:32.972 --> 23:36.308
- So we're stranded here?
- At least until morning.

23:36.342 --> 23:38.610
Great, so there could be
a psychopath trying to kill us

23:38.644 --> 23:40.578
and there's nothing
any of us can do about it.

23:40.612 --> 23:42.048
It's a small house, Rowan.

23:42.081 --> 23:45.051
I think we'd notice
the eighth unidentifiable person

23:45.084 --> 23:46.252
lurking in the shadows.

23:46.285 --> 23:48.054
He could be lurking outside.

23:48.087 --> 23:49.288
You don't know.

23:49.321 --> 23:51.357
First of all,
it could be a woman.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.793
Let's not undermine
psychotic women,

23:53.826 --> 23:55.661
because they're fucking nuts.

23:55.694 --> 23:57.963
Secondly, it's cold
and wet outside.

23:57.997 --> 23:59.141
None of us are
interesting enough

23:59.165 --> 24:01.734
to have a personal vendetta
against us.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.069
It's not a psychopath.

24:03.102 --> 24:04.003
All right, let's go back.

24:04.036 --> 24:05.805
Does anyone remember
who got here first?

24:05.838 --> 24:07.339
It was me.

24:07.373 --> 24:08.374
Um.

24:08.407 --> 24:11.343
No, fuck. Uh, maybe Zach?

24:11.377 --> 24:12.821
- I don't know.
- Look, I think we should

24:12.845 --> 24:13.813
just call the police.

24:13.846 --> 24:15.781
There's no service, remember?

24:15.815 --> 24:18.050
All of these
are in different handwritings.

24:18.084 --> 24:20.352
Do you think it means anything?

24:20.386 --> 24:22.354
Does it mean anything, Logan?

24:22.388 --> 24:24.323
I don't know,
I'm not a detective.

24:24.356 --> 24:26.292
You're the next closest thing.

24:26.325 --> 24:27.726
You're always bragging
about Yale,

24:27.760 --> 24:29.004
so why don't you start thinking?

24:29.028 --> 24:30.763
God, Rowan, why are you
such a bitch?

24:30.796 --> 24:33.099
Why are you such a fucking ditz?

24:33.132 --> 24:35.267
All right, shut the fuck up!

24:37.169 --> 24:38.346
You guys need to come see this.

24:38.370 --> 24:41.173
We need to get out
of this house.

24:59.191 --> 25:02.228
So, should we, like, take bets

25:02.261 --> 25:05.297
on who's gonna get
fucking axed first?

25:06.398 --> 25:08.367
Anyone?

25:10.002 --> 25:12.271
My money, definitely on Gil.

25:12.304 --> 25:15.007
Like, he would make me.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.375
Not if I sacrifice you first.

25:16.408 --> 25:18.310
All right, this isn't
funny anymore, you guys.

25:18.344 --> 25:19.178
Somebody, come clean.

25:19.211 --> 25:21.147
Rowan, we are all
a little bit sick,

25:21.180 --> 25:24.083
but nobody is that demented.

25:24.116 --> 25:25.851
What does this even mean?

25:25.885 --> 25:27.186
What secrets
is it talking about?

25:27.219 --> 25:29.255
I mean, we did our senior year.

25:29.288 --> 25:30.289
Oh, that's got to be it.

25:30.322 --> 25:33.192
Something tells me
this is a little more major.

25:33.225 --> 25:36.896
You know, some secrets exist
to protect other people...

25:40.733 --> 25:42.434
To protect yourself.

25:42.468 --> 25:44.803
Andy?

25:44.837 --> 25:48.040
Whoever wrote that is
seriously fucked in the head!

25:59.385 --> 26:00.319
- That's blood.
- So what do we do

26:00.352 --> 26:02.855
because we can't leave here

26:02.888 --> 26:05.357
and we can't call somebody
for help.

26:05.391 --> 26:08.727
And we obviously can't hide
from whatever it is.

26:08.761 --> 26:10.896
Whoever it is.

26:10.930 --> 26:12.464
Right.

26:14.433 --> 26:16.502
So we drink.

26:16.535 --> 26:18.337
- Seriously?
- What?

26:18.370 --> 26:20.172
I mean, this is
supposed to be a vacation.

26:20.206 --> 26:21.216
I haven't seen you guys
in years.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.784
I don't know
when I'm gonna see you again.

26:22.808 --> 26:23.818
We might as well have some fun

26:23.842 --> 26:28.147
until the demons take over
or whatever, right?

26:31.450 --> 26:33.152
Guys, you saw how Andy acted.

26:33.185 --> 26:37.156
How is us not being calm
going to help the situation?

26:42.061 --> 26:43.171
Okay, if we're still
placing bets,

26:43.195 --> 26:45.197
my vote is on Zach.

27:09.255 --> 27:12.992
- You all right?
- Yeah, I just can't sleep.

27:13.025 --> 27:16.262
- Need a distraction?
- That depends.

27:18.297 --> 27:20.165
James, stop.

27:20.199 --> 27:22.201
What are you trying to do?

27:22.234 --> 27:23.168
Trying to make a baby.

27:23.202 --> 27:25.137
What's it look like
I'm trying to do?

27:25.170 --> 27:28.007
Babe, maybe we should take
a break, all right?

27:28.040 --> 27:29.408
Something weird is going on.

27:29.441 --> 27:31.210
These are not our sheets.

27:31.243 --> 27:33.545
No, no breaks.

27:33.579 --> 27:35.914
I want to do this.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.817
For you, for us.

27:38.851 --> 27:40.452
I want this for us too.

27:40.486 --> 27:42.121
I don't want to fail you.

27:42.154 --> 27:44.857
You're not failing me.

27:44.890 --> 27:47.059
I feel like I am.

27:47.092 --> 27:48.360
Babe.

27:48.394 --> 27:50.996
The doctor said
when you're ovulating,

27:51.030 --> 27:52.898
that's when it's gonna work.

27:52.931 --> 27:54.833
I'm on top of this.

27:54.867 --> 27:56.468
I know your cycle by heart.

27:56.502 --> 27:58.037
It's important.

27:58.070 --> 28:00.172
It's important to us.

28:00.205 --> 28:03.208
So we have to try
extra hard this week.

28:05.878 --> 28:07.846
I promise I can do this.

28:07.880 --> 28:08.890
And I want to have a baby
with you

28:08.914 --> 28:11.450
more than anything in the world.

28:16.288 --> 28:18.290
Okay.

28:18.324 --> 28:20.025
We'll keep trying.

28:20.059 --> 28:22.361
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

28:32.037 --> 28:34.940
If I ask to go to the bathroom
really quick,

28:34.973 --> 28:37.910
will that kill the mood?

28:37.943 --> 28:39.578
Yes.

28:39.611 --> 28:42.381
I mean no, you're fine, just go.

28:42.414 --> 28:44.483
I'm sorry.

29:55.521 --> 29:58.524
- Gil?
- Mm.

29:58.557 --> 30:00.426
It's got to be one of us.

30:00.459 --> 30:02.094
- I just know it's one of...
- Babe...

30:04.363 --> 30:05.641
Well, I was just thinking
about it and...

30:05.665 --> 30:08.500
Yeah, I know you do that a lot.

30:11.570 --> 30:13.071
You all right?

30:13.105 --> 30:14.573
Yeah.

30:14.606 --> 30:17.409
All right, so come back
to bed, please.

30:26.251 --> 30:28.721
- Better?
- Yeah.

30:30.489 --> 30:31.758
Good.

30:37.697 --> 30:40.232
- I mean, there was...
- For god's sake, Logan.

30:40.265 --> 30:42.034
Why is no one else
freaking out about this?

30:42.067 --> 30:44.036
Because, honestly,
it's just a dumb prank.

30:44.069 --> 30:45.170
- A prank?
- Yeah.

30:45.204 --> 30:47.339
Roger is weird like that.

30:47.372 --> 30:48.741
What did you just say?

31:22.074 --> 31:23.776
Oh, no, no, no.

31:33.619 --> 31:36.656
Oh, no, no, no.

31:48.835 --> 31:50.536
Fuck!

31:50.569 --> 31:52.672
Fuck.

31:52.705 --> 31:54.741
It was all right here.

31:54.774 --> 31:56.308
Okay, okay.

31:56.341 --> 31:57.677
Roger this, Roger that.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.344
It's always been
about fucking Roger.

31:59.378 --> 32:02.281
I am just simply asking you
why you're accusing him.

32:02.314 --> 32:03.692
- That's all.
- And I'm simply asking you

32:03.716 --> 32:04.583
why are you defending him?

32:04.616 --> 32:05.818
I'm not.

32:05.852 --> 32:07.486
Yes, you are.

32:07.519 --> 32:10.422
Would you just answer
the question?

32:10.455 --> 32:11.323
Don't drill me like that.

32:11.356 --> 32:13.191
- Like what?
- Like one of your clients.

32:13.225 --> 32:15.527
Oh, see, I'm nice to my clients.

32:15.561 --> 32:16.328
I like my clients.

32:16.361 --> 32:18.130
- I don't like you.
- Oh, yeah?

32:18.163 --> 32:19.608
You like murderers and rapists
more than me?

32:19.632 --> 32:21.199
Yes.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.635
No.

32:22.669 --> 32:23.779
I don't know.
You're frustrating me.

32:23.803 --> 32:26.238
All right, just wait.

32:26.271 --> 32:27.406
Roger is a dick.

32:27.439 --> 32:30.309
I can just see him pulling
a dumb dick prank like this

32:30.342 --> 32:31.443
and then the surprise

32:31.476 --> 32:33.780
is that he's in rehab
or something.

32:33.813 --> 32:36.481
Just get back to bed, please.

32:36.515 --> 32:37.684
No.

32:37.717 --> 32:39.127
What is wrong with you?
What did I do?

32:39.151 --> 32:39.819
Do you want a list?

32:39.852 --> 32:41.353
Stop being so fucking stubborn.

32:41.386 --> 32:44.222
Then stop being
a total fucking prick.

32:45.390 --> 32:46.458
Are you serious?

32:46.491 --> 32:47.535
What? That always used to work.

32:47.559 --> 32:49.328
God, you are unreal.

32:49.361 --> 32:50.897
You are...

32:50.930 --> 32:53.165
Unreal.

32:53.198 --> 32:55.400
Logan...

33:00.807 --> 33:03.643
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:03.676 --> 33:04.777
Do you mind if I join you?

33:04.811 --> 33:06.578
Yeah, of course.

33:10.582 --> 33:13.686
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.388
- It's okay.
- No, I freaked out.

33:16.421 --> 33:18.199
Well, yeah, I mean,
something weird is going on.

33:18.223 --> 33:19.391
You had every right to.

33:19.424 --> 33:21.828
Yeah, but that's not me.

33:21.861 --> 33:23.595
I'm Andy, I'm the fun one.

33:23.630 --> 33:25.632
And I'm Zach, I'm the loser.

33:25.665 --> 33:27.834
- The ables are overrated.
- You're not a loser.

33:27.867 --> 33:29.201
You're perfect.

33:34.272 --> 33:36.208
Can I ask you something?

33:36.241 --> 33:37.609
Anything.

33:40.545 --> 33:44.416
Uh, why Roger?

33:44.449 --> 33:46.251
I mean, you could've had
any guy you wanted

33:46.284 --> 33:50.389
back in college and I know
that you still could, so...

33:50.422 --> 33:53.325
I don't know, um...

33:53.358 --> 33:57.664
He's funny, uh,
he always had weed

33:57.697 --> 33:59.498
which, you know I enjoy so much,

33:59.531 --> 34:01.701
and he was only interested
in the sex,

34:01.734 --> 34:03.736
so clearly my type.

34:03.770 --> 34:05.672
Why do you ask?

34:05.705 --> 34:08.841
I was... I was, uh, curious.

34:09.976 --> 34:12.712
Just be glad you never
messed around in the group.

34:12.745 --> 34:15.782
Complicated things.

34:15.815 --> 34:17.850
Mm, tell me about it.

34:19.351 --> 34:21.386
Wait a minute. Did you ever?

34:21.420 --> 34:22.454
- Oh my gosh.
- No.

34:22.487 --> 34:24.322
- Who?
- No.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.859
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

34:26.893 --> 34:29.261
Swear?

34:29.294 --> 34:30.663
I swear.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.740
Want to go to bed?

34:49.749 --> 34:54.619
Um, um, I'm gonna stay
with my beer, actually.

34:54.654 --> 34:57.023
You head on up.

34:57.056 --> 34:58.323
Okay.

34:58.356 --> 35:00.292
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight.

35:25.985 --> 35:28.453
Fuck.

35:39.598 --> 35:41.533
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

35:41.566 --> 35:44.003
Yeah, well, you did, so...

35:49.574 --> 35:50.843
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

35:50.877 --> 35:53.012
- You look terrible.
- I'm fine.

35:53.045 --> 35:54.781
- Roger...
- Andy, I can't do this

35:54.814 --> 35:56.749
right now, we can't... it's not
gonna happen.

35:56.783 --> 35:58.885
- Dude, what?
- This. Us. Sex.

35:58.918 --> 35:59.995
Okay, it's not... it's not
gonna happen.

36:00.019 --> 36:01.997
What makes you think
that's what I came in here for?

36:02.021 --> 36:04.556
Isn't it, though? That's what
you always come in here for.

36:04.589 --> 36:06.591
It's after midnight.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.493
You're bored,
I'm just... I'm here.

36:08.527 --> 36:11.998
Wow, okay. So that's
what you think about me.

36:12.031 --> 36:14.399
Just get out, okay?

36:14.432 --> 36:15.802
What the hell happened to you?

36:15.835 --> 36:18.603
I grew up, Andy!

36:18.638 --> 36:22.041
Just, please, just get out.

36:22.074 --> 36:23.475
Please.

36:23.508 --> 36:25.011
Just get out.

36:38.057 --> 36:40.960
- Don't talk to me.
- Nothing happened.

36:40.993 --> 36:42.695
Fuck.

36:46.632 --> 36:48.400
- You scared me.
- Yeah, well,

36:48.433 --> 36:50.602
you scared me, so...

36:50.636 --> 36:51.971
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

36:52.004 --> 36:55.507
- Let me look at you.
- I'm fine, okay?

37:09.889 --> 37:11.623
Be sane, girl.

37:11.657 --> 37:14.694
Lock your door.

37:14.727 --> 37:17.462
Okay.

38:22.828 --> 38:25.831
Help, help, help me.

38:25.865 --> 38:27.099
Help me, help.

38:29.835 --> 38:31.904
Help.

38:31.938 --> 38:33.639
Help me.

39:15.982 --> 39:17.283
Help me!

39:29.161 --> 39:31.130
Ow, ow.

39:31.163 --> 39:32.732
Ow, help me.

39:32.765 --> 39:34.599
Help me, ow, ow.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.534
Help me, help me, help me.

39:36.568 --> 39:38.070
Help.

39:42.875 --> 39:45.711
Help me.

39:45.745 --> 39:46.979
Help.

39:47.013 --> 39:48.580
Help me, help me.

39:48.613 --> 39:49.949
Help me.

39:51.317 --> 39:52.251
Help me!

39:52.284 --> 39:54.020
Help me! Help me!

39:58.190 --> 40:01.260
Zach, are you okay?

40:01.293 --> 40:03.829
I'm fine.

40:03.863 --> 40:05.064
-I'm fine.

40:53.879 --> 40:57.016
Mm, good morning, sunshine.

40:57.049 --> 40:59.318
Hey, how's it going?

40:59.351 --> 41:00.352
You look like shit.

41:02.421 --> 41:04.657
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Sure.

41:04.690 --> 41:06.358
They're just made.

41:11.330 --> 41:14.166
Drugs, day two.
Day two, doing drugs.

41:19.905 --> 41:21.941
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, no, I just, uh,

41:21.974 --> 41:23.809
I didn't sleep much last night.

41:23.843 --> 41:24.953
Do you want me
to make you some coffee?

41:24.977 --> 41:27.713
I'm good, I'm good, but thanks.

41:27.746 --> 41:28.890
- Something happen?
- No, can you just leave me

41:28.914 --> 41:30.316
the fuck alone?

41:30.349 --> 41:32.184
Please?

41:32.218 --> 41:34.320
Thanks.

41:42.261 --> 41:44.296
All right, so me and Gil
are gonna head into town,

41:44.330 --> 41:46.165
see how bad the path is.

41:46.198 --> 41:47.242
Babe, you want to call the cops?

41:47.266 --> 41:49.135
Sure thing, babe.

42:21.867 --> 42:23.102
- Dude.
- Mm.

42:23.135 --> 42:25.104
Will you put the papers away?

42:25.137 --> 42:26.205
No.

42:26.238 --> 42:28.941
Scheduled to stand in
on surgery when I get back.

42:28.974 --> 42:29.808
I'm supposed to hold a heart.

42:29.842 --> 42:31.911
Like an actual human heart
this time.

42:31.944 --> 42:34.013
- I got to be prepared.
- Okay.

42:34.046 --> 42:35.114
All right.

42:35.147 --> 42:36.382
It's your vacation to ruin.

42:36.415 --> 42:39.351
This isn't much
of a vacation for me.

42:39.385 --> 42:40.719
I hate bugs and trees.

42:40.753 --> 42:41.763
Don't you live in Washington?

42:41.787 --> 42:42.421
Like, aren't there bugs
and trees?

42:42.454 --> 42:45.424
Seattle, city of Washington.

42:45.457 --> 42:47.459
There's no bugs,
just buildings and rain.

42:47.493 --> 42:48.561
Okay.

42:48.594 --> 42:51.463
So then why would you come
to a cabin in the woods

42:51.497 --> 42:53.232
where there are nothing
but bugs and trees

42:53.265 --> 42:54.500
as far as the eye can see?

42:54.533 --> 42:56.468
- For Logan.
- What?

42:59.471 --> 43:01.473
I never should have
just left her, man.

43:01.507 --> 43:04.810
Wait, wait, hold on,
so this means you...

43:04.843 --> 43:06.779
I want her to come back
to Seattle with me.

43:08.847 --> 43:10.449
You think she would?

43:10.482 --> 43:12.051
I'll convince her, I always do.

43:12.084 --> 43:13.786
Jesus Christ, dude.

43:15.020 --> 43:17.389
Oh, shit.

43:20.793 --> 43:23.495
Hey.

43:23.529 --> 43:26.298
Yeah, no, I'm good.

43:26.332 --> 43:30.769
Last night was just scary.

43:32.171 --> 43:35.341
Yeah, I just...

43:35.374 --> 43:37.276
I just want to be home with you.

43:40.846 --> 43:42.481
Jesus.

43:42.514 --> 43:44.183
Is everything okay?

43:44.216 --> 43:47.519
Yeah, it's just work stuff.

43:47.553 --> 43:49.054
Oh.

43:49.088 --> 43:53.459
Do they want a live band
or a dj?

43:53.492 --> 43:56.262
Hey, are you okay?
Do you need to vent?

43:56.295 --> 43:59.098
No and no,

43:59.131 --> 44:03.235
but I know you won't stop
until I do, so...

44:04.503 --> 44:07.239
It's very true.

44:07.273 --> 44:10.409
How's the baby-making going?

44:10.442 --> 44:13.846
Oh, not... we're not...

44:13.879 --> 44:16.315
Not here.

44:16.348 --> 44:18.183
The walls are really thin

44:18.217 --> 44:20.986
and everything is
made of wood, so...

44:21.020 --> 44:22.821
- Right.
- Yeah, you are,

44:22.855 --> 44:25.824
but don't be embarrassed.

44:25.858 --> 44:27.369
You and James are at this point
in your life

44:27.393 --> 44:29.862
and, honestly, if it's going
to make you super happy,

44:29.895 --> 44:32.298
- then why not?
- Yeah, I know!

44:32.331 --> 44:34.066
I know, and I know
that this is what you do

44:34.099 --> 44:35.968
at this point.

44:36.001 --> 44:39.271
- And I am happy.
- Are you?

44:45.511 --> 44:47.246
Oh, shit.

44:48.380 --> 44:50.282
Fuck.

44:50.316 --> 44:54.186
We're not even on
a main road yet.

44:55.254 --> 44:56.088
Hey, can you pop the trunk?

44:56.121 --> 44:57.956
I'm gonna see
if you have a spare.

44:57.990 --> 44:59.491
James?

44:59.525 --> 45:01.126
What are you doing?

45:01.160 --> 45:02.127
I'm calling Rowan.

45:02.161 --> 45:03.595
No, don't do that.

45:03.630 --> 45:05.464
- Why?
- Because...

45:05.497 --> 45:06.365
We have to tell the police.

45:06.398 --> 45:08.434
No, what if it's them,
one of them?

45:08.467 --> 45:10.135
This would just make it worse.

45:10.169 --> 45:12.338
What the fuck is wrong with you?

45:12.371 --> 45:14.106
- Gil!
- Logan was right.

45:14.139 --> 45:15.040
She's always right.

45:15.074 --> 45:16.041
I need you to calm down.

45:16.075 --> 45:17.620
You're acting ridiculous,
gimme the phone.

45:17.644 --> 45:19.511
Dude, something weird
is going on.

45:19.545 --> 45:20.479
I thought she was overreacting,

45:20.512 --> 45:22.081
but look at the evidence.

45:22.114 --> 45:24.283
The storm, the weird messages,
the fucking invitations,

45:24.316 --> 45:26.452
- and now a flat tire?
- So what?

45:26.485 --> 45:28.020
So what? What?

45:28.053 --> 45:29.130
What do you mean "so what"?

45:29.154 --> 45:31.023
I just don't see how
any of this is connected.

45:31.056 --> 45:33.158
Dude, give me my phone.

45:34.626 --> 45:36.562
Was it all part of
the perfect plan?

45:36.595 --> 45:37.664
Plan? What plan, Gil?

45:37.697 --> 45:39.264
Your plan, your fucking plan.

45:39.298 --> 45:40.966
Don't fucking touch me.

45:40.999 --> 45:43.369
You never told Rowan about Andy.

45:43.402 --> 45:44.203
What did you just say?

45:44.236 --> 45:45.638
When you fucked Andy
freshman year.

45:45.672 --> 45:46.538
Before I even met Rowan?

45:46.572 --> 45:47.606
How many times?

45:47.640 --> 45:49.441
What does this even matter?

45:49.475 --> 45:51.110
Is she in on this?

45:51.143 --> 45:52.487
Are you guys trying
to get revenge on Andy

45:52.511 --> 45:54.380
and all of us are collateral?

45:54.413 --> 45:56.382
- Is that what this is?
- You think my secrets

45:56.415 --> 45:57.549
are the biggest ones here?

45:57.583 --> 45:59.051
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh my god,

45:59.084 --> 46:00.386
I'm not proud for leaving Logan.

46:00.419 --> 46:01.587
That was never a secret.

46:01.620 --> 46:03.021
Everyone knows that.

46:03.055 --> 46:05.057
Does Logan know why
Roger is the way he is?

46:07.259 --> 46:08.227
I don't know what
you're talking about.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.396
Oh, you don't? Freshman year.

46:10.429 --> 46:11.674
You said you didn't
even like Logan.

46:11.698 --> 46:13.399
You said she was too shy,
too like-minded,

46:13.432 --> 46:14.500
too opinionated.

46:14.533 --> 46:16.411
And, then, I remember you
telling our pledge class

46:16.435 --> 46:18.170
how on your first date
you shoved your dick

46:18.203 --> 46:20.105
in her mouth just to get her
to "stop talking."

46:20.139 --> 46:20.906
I was an idiot.

46:20.939 --> 46:21.983
I said stupid shit all the time.

46:22.007 --> 46:23.275
Then we met Roger.

46:23.308 --> 46:25.577
She really
and I mean really liked him.

46:25.611 --> 46:28.514
And he liked her, there was
like an instant spark.

46:28.547 --> 46:30.115
Then our first week of finals,

46:30.149 --> 46:31.493
Roger was really stressed
and you bought him

46:31.517 --> 46:33.952
some Adderall, was it,
to help him focus?

46:33.986 --> 46:35.722
Yeah. Kids do it all the time.

46:35.755 --> 46:38.223
Mm-hmm, but then you bought him
a second, third,

46:38.257 --> 46:39.558
fourth, and fifth batch, right?

46:39.591 --> 46:42.461
And then Adderall became Xanax,
and Xanax became oxy,

46:42.494 --> 46:43.962
and oxy became
a little bit of coke,

46:43.996 --> 46:45.106
and then you almost killed him
with fentanyl...

46:45.130 --> 46:47.142
- All right, stop!
- 'Cause you didn't even care!

46:47.166 --> 46:48.276
You didn't care
about his addiction

46:48.300 --> 46:53.305
or how much he would cry
every time the drugs got worse,

46:53.338 --> 46:54.973
because the worse they got,

46:55.007 --> 46:59.478
the easier it was for you
to ruin their lives.

46:59.511 --> 47:01.980
Do you think he knows
that you filled him

47:02.014 --> 47:05.150
with all those drugs
because she would've picked him?

47:05.184 --> 47:07.519
Because Gil Grady doesn't lose.

47:07.553 --> 47:08.755
Hmm?

47:08.788 --> 47:11.023
Should we tell him?

47:11.056 --> 47:12.491
You better watch
your fucking mouth.

47:12.524 --> 47:14.193
I said don't fucking touch me.

47:35.414 --> 47:38.584
What about your wedding night?

47:38.617 --> 47:41.587
When you told Andy
it wasn't too late?

47:43.055 --> 47:46.158
That you two could still
run away together?

47:46.191 --> 47:48.661
And then you fucked her
one last time.

47:48.695 --> 47:51.096
Maybe we should tell
your wife about that.

47:59.672 --> 48:01.039
Stop, stop, stop!

48:01.073 --> 48:02.809
Oh, fuck!

48:02.842 --> 48:04.443
Oh, no...

48:06.578 --> 48:09.481
What the hell is wrong with you?

48:11.250 --> 48:12.685
My god, I need this hand.

48:12.719 --> 48:14.253
What the fuck!

49:03.636 --> 49:05.203
Anyone wanna go skinny dipping?

49:05.237 --> 49:08.106
- No.
- Not really.

49:08.140 --> 49:10.242
All right.

49:10.275 --> 49:11.644
How about a game?

49:11.678 --> 49:13.245
We're already drinking,

49:13.278 --> 49:15.314
so, king's cup?

49:15.347 --> 49:16.315
Truth or dare?

49:16.348 --> 49:17.583
No one's in the mood, Andy.

49:18.851 --> 49:20.485
Well, fuck this tension.

49:20.519 --> 49:22.421
Seriously, I'm sick of it.

49:22.454 --> 49:25.190
I get it, we're stuck here.

49:31.430 --> 49:32.899
Rowan,

49:32.932 --> 49:33.866
truth or dare?

49:33.900 --> 49:35.802
Andy, come on.

49:35.835 --> 49:37.603
No, James, you come on.

49:37.637 --> 49:39.471
This sadness is gonna kill me

49:39.504 --> 49:41.540
before whoever sent
the letter does.

49:41.573 --> 49:43.442
I forgot about the letters.

49:44.644 --> 49:45.644
How?

49:49.849 --> 49:51.450
Rowan,

49:51.483 --> 49:52.785
truth or dare?

49:54.954 --> 49:56.689
Truth.

49:56.723 --> 49:58.758
Excellent.

50:01.226 --> 50:03.528
If not James, who would it be?

50:06.933 --> 50:08.400
Uh...

50:08.433 --> 50:11.169
I guess I'd have to say

50:11.203 --> 50:12.537
Gil.

50:12.571 --> 50:16.375
And he wouldn't want
a real doctor.

50:16.408 --> 50:19.746
Wow, uh, don't remember
specifying that they had to be

50:19.779 --> 50:22.347
in our inner circle of friends,
but kudos.

50:22.381 --> 50:25.384
Stop! Come on!

50:25.417 --> 50:26.618
I'm joking.

50:28.420 --> 50:31.758
There's no man I would rather
start a family with.

50:35.494 --> 50:37.229
Okay.

50:39.866 --> 50:41.668
Zach,

50:41.701 --> 50:43.201
truth or dare?

50:44.536 --> 50:46.673
Uh, truth.

50:46.706 --> 50:50.943
What is your biggest,
deepest, darkest secret?

50:50.977 --> 50:52.477
Rowan, I don't think
that's very nice.

50:52.511 --> 50:53.680
What?

50:53.713 --> 50:56.649
Secrets... secrets
are no fun, right?

50:56.683 --> 50:58.651
Do you really think
that's the smartest idea?

50:58.685 --> 51:01.386
Whoever wrote that
likes to play games.

51:01.420 --> 51:02.587
So do I.

51:04.757 --> 51:06.358
Zach?

51:08.260 --> 51:09.896
- Um...
- I can answer it for you.

51:09.929 --> 51:12.230
If you know it,
then it's not a secret, dumb-ass.

51:12.264 --> 51:13.432
Don't call her that.

51:13.465 --> 51:14.634
Go ahead, Zach, tell her.

51:16.368 --> 51:17.469
Tell her.

51:17.502 --> 51:19.604
I'm in therapy.

51:20.807 --> 51:23.275
Um, when I lost my job

51:23.308 --> 51:25.712
and Zoe left me,
I was in a really dark place,

51:25.745 --> 51:28.848
so I now go to therapy
twice a week,

51:28.881 --> 51:31.884
and I have medication
which I refuse to take

51:31.918 --> 51:35.287
because I wanna maintain
some level of normalcy

51:35.320 --> 51:38.490
which, as you all know,
is pretty hard for me.

51:38.523 --> 51:40.559
Um, and because
I don't take them,

51:40.592 --> 51:44.496
I now get horrific nightmares
which Roger can attest to,

51:44.529 --> 51:47.867
and... I think I'm hitting
all the notes here.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.902
Did I miss anything, Rowan?

51:49.936 --> 51:51.503
I was just trying
to have some fun.

51:51.536 --> 51:53.505
I think I was, too,
but if that's not

51:53.538 --> 51:55.507
your definition of fun, what is?

51:55.540 --> 51:57.777
Um... Roger,

51:57.810 --> 52:00.512
truth or dare?

52:00.545 --> 52:01.814
- Dare.
- Terrific.

52:01.848 --> 52:05.752
How about I dare you
to kiss someone right now?

52:05.785 --> 52:07.252
Make it count.

52:27.339 --> 52:28.908
- Thanks, little buddy.
- No problem.

52:34.046 --> 52:35.547
Your turn to pick somebody.

52:35.580 --> 52:37.784
I don't think anyone
wants to play.

52:37.817 --> 52:39.384
No, keep going.

52:39.417 --> 52:40.820
I'm having so much fun.

52:40.853 --> 52:43.522
Okay! Andy, truth or dare?

52:47.827 --> 52:49.427
Dare.

52:50.797 --> 52:55.034
I dare you to...

52:55.067 --> 52:56.601
Shut up for the rest
of the night.

52:58.370 --> 52:59.604
Well, that's impossible

52:59.639 --> 53:00.883
'cause I have to nominate
the next...

53:00.907 --> 53:02.416
No, no, no, see,
Zach can be your voice.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.844
He barely talks,
and you talk so much...

53:04.877 --> 53:06.012
Logan, truth or dare?

53:08.948 --> 53:11.751
- Truth.
- Hmm.

53:11.784 --> 53:14.921
Who is your very best friend
in the whole wide world?

53:14.954 --> 53:16.488
And you can't say Zach Davis.

53:19.058 --> 53:20.927
Okay, so, if I can't pick you...

53:20.960 --> 53:23.095
- Right.
- Then I guess I'd have to pick

53:23.129 --> 53:24.462
Andy.

53:24.496 --> 53:25.496
What?

53:26.732 --> 53:27.733
What?

53:27.767 --> 53:28.768
No, it's just weird.

53:28.801 --> 53:29.902
I didn't expect that.

53:29.936 --> 53:31.804
It's just a game, Rowan.

53:31.838 --> 53:34.841
Careful,
your jealousy is showing.

53:34.874 --> 53:37.442
I would never be jealous of you.

53:37.475 --> 53:40.378
You've been not so subtle
about it all weekend.

53:40.412 --> 53:41.848
What's there to be jealous of?

53:41.881 --> 53:43.883
I have a career, a husband.
What do you have?

53:43.916 --> 53:45.617
All right, stop.

53:47.153 --> 53:48.821
Gil,

53:48.855 --> 53:50.089
truth or date?

53:50.122 --> 53:51.924
Truth.

53:51.958 --> 53:55.560
How did you really break
your hand?

53:57.529 --> 53:59.131
- I fell.
- You're lying.

53:59.165 --> 54:00.666
Stop, stop doing that.

54:00.700 --> 54:02.101
- Doing what?
- Interrogating me.

54:02.134 --> 54:04.436
- I'm fucking sick of it.
- Maybe he did it on purpose.

54:04.469 --> 54:06.939
- Excuse me?
- I just think it's kinda funny

54:06.973 --> 54:09.909
how you and James
are the only two people

54:09.942 --> 54:11.443
who say we can't leave.

54:11.476 --> 54:12.712
You think I did all this?

54:12.745 --> 54:13.980
I do, yeah!

54:15.014 --> 54:17.116
- Really?
- Yes.

54:19.051 --> 54:21.654
Well, you're right, it was me.

54:21.687 --> 54:22.955
I planned all of it.

54:22.989 --> 54:25.124
The letters,
the bloody messages in the barn.

54:25.157 --> 54:27.501
I even broke my hand to make it
more of a fucking challenge.

54:27.525 --> 54:29.662
- I bet you did!
- Boys, enough.

54:31.596 --> 54:33.032
You know, isn't it strange

54:33.065 --> 54:34.934
that you and your wife
are the only ones

54:34.967 --> 54:36.011
who didn't send anyone letters?

54:36.035 --> 54:37.469
What you trying to say?

54:37.502 --> 54:39.014
You know exactly
what I'm trying to say.

54:39.038 --> 54:41.573
And Logan's the only person here
to have invited two people.

54:41.606 --> 54:43.051
Is she in conspiracy
with my wife and I?

54:43.075 --> 54:45.053
- Leave Logan out of this.
- Yeah, 'cause it could never be

54:45.077 --> 54:47.780
either one of your faults
'cause you're just so perfect.

54:47.813 --> 54:49.682
- I'm gonna tell her.
- Tell her.

54:49.715 --> 54:50.850
Tell everyone. Tell Roger.

54:50.883 --> 54:52.084
- What?
- Guys, knock it off.

54:52.118 --> 54:53.753
Aw, is zachie sad?

54:53.786 --> 54:55.487
- Is zachie upset...
- Gil, stop!

54:55.520 --> 54:57.123
- Oh, shut up, slut.
- Fuck you!

54:57.156 --> 54:59.091
- Whoa!
- What's wrong, zachie?

54:59.125 --> 55:00.960
Are you gonna cry?

55:02.962 --> 55:04.797
I just don't think
that we should be turning

55:04.830 --> 55:05.932
on each other, Gil.

55:05.965 --> 55:07.599
Yeah, well,

55:07.633 --> 55:10.670
it's a little too late
for that now, isn't it?

55:17.944 --> 55:21.647
Tomorrow when they clear
the roads, we get outta here.

55:42.068 --> 55:43.568
Fuck.

55:49.008 --> 55:50.876
Fuck!

56:44.964 --> 56:46.098
Zach?

56:48.768 --> 56:50.669
- Oh.
- Sorry.

56:50.703 --> 56:52.071
No reception in the basement?

56:52.104 --> 56:55.074
- Uh, no, just music.
- Oh.

56:55.107 --> 56:58.711
Um, can I sleep in here tonight?

56:59.345 --> 57:01.579
Uh... sure.

57:01.613 --> 57:03.015
Uh, are you okay?

57:04.350 --> 57:06.252
No.

57:07.820 --> 57:09.088
Hop in.

57:27.873 --> 57:29.075
Ready to lose?

57:31.710 --> 57:33.813
Just like college.

57:44.690 --> 57:46.092
Hey.

57:47.660 --> 57:50.663
Did your first option
turn you down?

57:52.031 --> 57:54.967
You're mad then, I'm guessing?

57:55.000 --> 57:56.335
Why would you ask that?

57:56.368 --> 57:59.905
For... me kissing Andy
at the fire.

57:59.939 --> 58:02.174
No, you and Andy
were always a thing.

58:02.208 --> 58:03.409
No...

58:03.442 --> 58:06.412
We were not always a thing.

58:06.445 --> 58:08.214
Moved out 'cause, I don't know,

58:08.247 --> 58:10.983
there's no one else
to go home to, I guess.

58:11.016 --> 58:13.719
It's not a thing,
it's... it's sad.

58:13.752 --> 58:16.789
Roger, you don't have to explain
yourself, it was just a game.

58:16.822 --> 58:19.925
Were you expecting me
to kiss you during this game?

58:22.128 --> 58:23.963
I'm kidding.

58:25.097 --> 58:26.165
Okay.

58:28.801 --> 58:30.436
Do you wanna smoke a little bit?

58:30.469 --> 58:31.737
I wish we could.

58:31.770 --> 58:33.038
All my drugs keep disappearing,

58:33.072 --> 58:35.407
so I have nothing to offer.

58:35.441 --> 58:37.877
Drugs as in... plural.

58:38.911 --> 58:40.379
You know what I mean, like...

58:40.412 --> 58:41.914
I'm... I'm fine.

58:41.947 --> 58:43.849
I thought you got better, Roger.

58:43.883 --> 58:47.753
I'm... I'm better from what
I used to be, for sure.

58:47.786 --> 58:49.054
Really?

58:50.856 --> 58:52.758
Um...

58:52.791 --> 58:55.027
I've been like that all day.

58:56.328 --> 58:58.030
All right, come on,
smoke with me.

58:58.063 --> 59:00.142
- It'll get rid of the shaking.
- I don't have anything.

59:00.166 --> 59:01.167
I told you that.

59:01.200 --> 59:03.402
Oh, I know, I know.

59:03.435 --> 59:05.237
- Logan...
- But what if I do?

59:05.271 --> 59:06.372
You don't. That's...

59:07.439 --> 59:09.041
She tiny but she mighty.

59:09.074 --> 59:10.776
Wow, wow, nice.

59:10.809 --> 59:12.278
Okay, great.

59:12.311 --> 59:13.913
You know this is illegal?

59:13.946 --> 59:14.947
- Is it?
- Yeah.

59:14.980 --> 59:17.149
I'm 127 percent sure

59:17.183 --> 59:18.284
this is illegal.

59:18.317 --> 59:19.952
Oh my god, then it's so good

59:19.985 --> 59:21.220
that I know a great lawyer.

59:21.253 --> 59:23.122
- Where... of course you do.
- It's me.

59:23.155 --> 59:25.024
Where has this been
the whole time?

59:25.057 --> 59:28.827
- Holding out on me.
- I am, 'cause you upset me.

59:28.861 --> 59:31.096
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

59:33.232 --> 59:34.900
Do you remember that night

59:34.934 --> 59:37.937
freshman year when I ate
really bad Sushi

59:37.970 --> 59:40.472
and I was throwing up all night?

59:40.506 --> 59:43.842
But you laid in bed with me
for like five hours

59:43.876 --> 59:46.378
just running your hands
through my hair

59:46.412 --> 59:49.949
and singing really badly
to make me feel better.

59:49.982 --> 59:52.885
- It wasn't that bad.
- It was pretty bad.

59:52.918 --> 59:56.755
Thoughtful and tone-deaf
does sound like me.

59:56.789 --> 59:59.892
I think about that night a lot.

1:00:02.361 --> 1:00:05.197
I think about you all the time.

1:00:11.337 --> 1:00:13.272
- Ow.
- What... what happened?

1:00:13.305 --> 1:00:15.140
- Nothing.
- You winced. What's wrong?

1:00:15.174 --> 1:00:17.076
No, I'm fine,
don't worry about it.

1:00:17.109 --> 1:00:19.445
Andy, Andy, stop, stop.

1:00:19.478 --> 1:00:21.313
- What did you do?
- I'm fine.

1:00:21.347 --> 1:00:23.082
- When did you do that?
- I'm fine!

1:00:23.115 --> 1:00:26.485
- Is that why you're in therapy?
- Andy, no, I'm fine.

1:00:26.518 --> 1:00:28.787
- Then show me.
- What?

1:00:28.821 --> 1:00:31.257
I want to see how fine you are.

1:00:40.432 --> 1:00:43.902
Is the other one like that?

1:00:43.936 --> 1:00:45.537
Yeah.

1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:50.576
But why didn't you call me?

1:00:50.609 --> 1:00:52.278
Any of us.

1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:57.049
I didn't think anyone
would care.

1:00:57.082 --> 1:00:58.784
Oh my god.

1:01:00.119 --> 1:01:01.920
Is this your secret?

1:01:01.954 --> 1:01:03.055
My secret?

1:01:03.088 --> 1:01:04.857
That message...

1:01:04.890 --> 1:01:07.393
Stupid message.

1:01:07.426 --> 1:01:09.161
Oh.

1:01:09.194 --> 1:01:10.429
Um...

1:01:11.497 --> 1:01:14.933
No, I don't think
this would be mine, Andy.

1:01:14.967 --> 1:01:16.535
How?

1:01:16.568 --> 1:01:20.039
I have older secrets.

1:01:20.072 --> 1:01:22.374
Zach, you're...
You're starting to scare me.

1:01:24.009 --> 1:01:25.210
What's going on?

1:01:27.513 --> 1:01:30.382
Um...

1:01:30.416 --> 1:01:32.217
Andy, uh...

1:01:35.921 --> 1:01:37.556
Wait. What... what are you doing?

1:01:37.589 --> 1:01:39.358
Andy, I'm so in love
with you, okay?

1:01:39.391 --> 1:01:41.169
I have been in love with you
since the first moment

1:01:41.193 --> 1:01:42.638
I ever saw you,
that night that you came

1:01:42.662 --> 1:01:44.363
into my and Roger's room
freshman year

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:46.265
in your underwear, drunk,
looking for Logan.

1:01:46.298 --> 1:01:48.367
I remember thinking
you are the most beautiful girl

1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:50.378
that I have ever seen, and I
never stopped thinking that.

1:01:50.402 --> 1:01:52.615
I've thought that every single
second for the last eight years

1:01:52.639 --> 1:01:56.208
and I've just been too much
of a... pussy to tell you

1:01:56.241 --> 1:01:58.944
because every day I wonder
what would've happened

1:01:58.977 --> 1:02:01.413
if I'd told you sooner
because it's always been me.

1:02:01.447 --> 1:02:02.649
It's not Roger, it's me.

1:02:02.682 --> 1:02:05.217
And I think that
if I had told you sooner,

1:02:05.250 --> 1:02:09.154
I wouldn't have ever done
any of this.

1:02:09.188 --> 1:02:10.923
Zach...

1:02:10.956 --> 1:02:14.426
Do you really think
I'm that stupid?

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:16.495
- What?
- Last night, I...

1:02:16.528 --> 1:02:18.063
You rejected me.

1:02:18.097 --> 1:02:19.675
- No, I wanted to come.
- And now that I know,

1:02:19.699 --> 1:02:21.400
all of a sudden
you're in love with me?

1:02:21.433 --> 1:02:24.136
Yeah... no,
I didn't have sex with you

1:02:24.169 --> 1:02:25.648
because I'm in love with you,
that's my point.

1:02:25.672 --> 1:02:27.182
You think because I'm me,
you can make up

1:02:27.206 --> 1:02:28.440
this bullshit love confession

1:02:28.474 --> 1:02:31.243
to deflect from the fact that
you're trying to kill yourself?

1:02:31.276 --> 1:02:33.088
- That is not what I'm doing!
- "Oh, Andy's easy.

1:02:33.112 --> 1:02:34.613
I'll just fuck her
until she shuts up.

1:02:34.647 --> 1:02:35.581
She'll totally forget..."

1:02:35.614 --> 1:02:38.350
I wasn't even gonna tell you
about it!

1:02:41.487 --> 1:02:46.191
You were in love with me
when you were engaged?

1:02:46.225 --> 1:02:48.026
I tried not to be.

1:02:53.165 --> 1:02:55.234
Okay, well, then,
what was this, Andy?

1:02:55.267 --> 1:02:56.978
You came in,
you're talking about that night,

1:02:57.002 --> 1:02:58.580
you were cuddling me,
you tried to kiss me.

1:02:58.604 --> 1:03:00.239
You're gonna say
that you never had

1:03:00.272 --> 1:03:03.175
any kind of feelings
for me whatsoever?

1:03:03.208 --> 1:03:05.577
- I'm not in love with you, Zach.
- Andy, come on.

1:03:05.611 --> 1:03:06.612
I'm sorry, Andy.

1:03:06.646 --> 1:03:09.448
- I can't be near you right now.
- Please don't.

1:03:27.767 --> 1:03:30.602
- I don't remember that.
- You totally should!

1:03:33.105 --> 1:03:34.406
Oh, man.

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:36.709
I had to sit
on your tiny twin bed,

1:03:36.743 --> 1:03:38.477
which is the smallest thing
in the world

1:03:38.510 --> 1:03:40.680
with all the pillows
and stuffed animals and shit.

1:03:40.713 --> 1:03:42.481
I know, I was there.

1:03:42.514 --> 1:03:45.317
I listened to you cry
about how he never...

1:03:45.350 --> 1:03:49.321
Called or texted
after you lost it to him.

1:03:49.354 --> 1:03:52.324
- Do you have a point?
- Yeah, I...

1:03:54.359 --> 1:03:57.196
I kissed you, and then...

1:04:00.432 --> 1:04:02.301
And like, the next day,

1:04:02.334 --> 1:04:03.670
you guys were together.

1:04:03.703 --> 1:04:06.038
Yeah, but I slept with you
like a year later.

1:04:06.071 --> 1:04:09.208
Just to get back at Gil, like,
it wasn't anything serious.

1:04:09.241 --> 1:04:12.277
- No!
- It's exactly what happened,

1:04:12.311 --> 1:04:14.313
'cause that night,
he went to his frat party

1:04:14.346 --> 1:04:18.383
instead of your soccer game,
and you came back to my room

1:04:18.417 --> 1:04:21.053
crying, and we...

1:04:21.086 --> 1:04:23.088
And, uh...

1:04:25.457 --> 1:04:29.595
We never talked about it
after that ever again.

1:04:29.628 --> 1:04:32.632
How do you remember all of that?

1:04:32.665 --> 1:04:35.167
It's just stupid, I...

1:04:36.468 --> 1:04:38.638
I remember everything about you.

1:04:38.671 --> 1:04:40.539
It's dumb, I know, it's stupid.

1:04:40.572 --> 1:04:42.441
No, it's not.

1:04:42.474 --> 1:04:46.545
Yeah, it is, but it's true, so.

1:04:46.578 --> 1:04:48.681
Okay, I have to tell you
something.

1:04:48.715 --> 1:04:51.483
- What?
- I had the biggest crush on you.

1:04:51.517 --> 1:04:54.386
- Yeah, okay.
- I did, after that night!

1:04:54.419 --> 1:04:56.121
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

1:04:57.523 --> 1:04:59.759
Why didn't you tell me?

1:05:02.094 --> 1:05:04.329
I don't know.

1:05:04.363 --> 1:05:06.265
- I was scared, I think.
- Of what?

1:05:06.298 --> 1:05:10.068
- 'Cause I wasn't him?
- No, that's not...

1:05:11.671 --> 1:05:16.308
No matter how many times
he hurt you and...

1:05:17.710 --> 1:05:20.579
How many times you said
he made you feel like

1:05:20.612 --> 1:05:25.183
just completely worthless,
like shit,

1:05:25.217 --> 1:05:28.655
you always chose him, and...

1:05:30.522 --> 1:05:32.357
I get it, I guess.

1:05:32.391 --> 1:05:34.560
I wasn't cool.

1:05:34.593 --> 1:05:39.565
I wasn't popular,
I wasn't strong, I couldn't...

1:05:39.598 --> 1:05:42.501
I couldn't get us into parties,

1:05:42.534 --> 1:05:44.503
couldn't protect you,
I just wasn't him.

1:05:44.536 --> 1:05:47.840
- I never wanted you to be him.
- I tried, I always tried.

1:05:47.874 --> 1:05:50.108
- I'm still trying.
- Roger, hey, stop!

1:05:50.142 --> 1:05:53.846
I... I followed you around
like a puppy dog, you know.

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:56.214
I slept with your best friend
hoping you'd notice me.

1:05:56.248 --> 1:05:58.317
I was a... I was a drug addict.

1:06:03.723 --> 1:06:06.558
I...

1:06:06.592 --> 1:06:08.627
I am.

1:06:09.729 --> 1:06:10.863
I know.

1:06:12.865 --> 1:06:16.836
I wouldn't have chosen me
either, honestly.

1:06:16.869 --> 1:06:19.471
- I wish I had chose you.
- No, you don't.

1:06:19.504 --> 1:06:21.506
- I do, no, I suck.
- No, I suck!

1:06:21.540 --> 1:06:24.509
I should've told you how I felt.
I should've...

1:06:24.543 --> 1:06:26.411
I should've kissed you
when I wanted to,

1:06:26.445 --> 1:06:29.247
I should've said something
sooner,

1:06:29.281 --> 1:06:31.550
spoke my mind, I don't know.

1:06:31.583 --> 1:06:34.754
- I should've done a lot.
- When did you want to kiss me?

1:06:37.356 --> 1:06:40.626
When I met you,

1:06:40.660 --> 1:06:42.260
at that party.

1:06:44.664 --> 1:06:47.366
The first time
we went ice skating.

1:06:49.368 --> 1:06:53.505
The football game you won with
like four pointless overtimes.

1:06:59.712 --> 1:07:01.681
Now.

1:07:01.714 --> 1:07:03.683
I want to kiss you now.

1:07:13.458 --> 1:07:16.628
Sorry if that was... forward.

1:07:16.663 --> 1:07:18.230
No, no, no.

1:07:25.470 --> 1:07:27.606
Do you want to talk about it?

1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:28.708
No.

1:07:28.741 --> 1:07:30.575
Because you did do it.

1:07:30.609 --> 1:07:31.476
Oh my god.

1:07:31.510 --> 1:07:34.346
- That is just great, James!
- I had to.

1:07:34.379 --> 1:07:35.658
I don't even know
what that means.

1:07:35.682 --> 1:07:36.883
He was talking like a lunatic!

1:07:36.916 --> 1:07:38.417
He kept going on about the plan

1:07:38.450 --> 1:07:39.795
and saying that Logan
was always right,

1:07:39.819 --> 1:07:41.453
whatever the fuck that means...
I had to!

1:07:43.790 --> 1:07:44.857
I'm not a monster.

1:07:50.328 --> 1:07:54.566
Look, I believe you, okay?

1:07:54.599 --> 1:07:57.937
I'm sorry.

1:07:57.970 --> 1:07:59.471
I don't know if I trust them.

1:07:59.504 --> 1:08:00.873
James, they're our best friends.

1:08:00.907 --> 1:08:01.708
Are they?

1:08:01.741 --> 1:08:04.609
When was the last time
we saw them?

1:08:04.644 --> 1:08:06.578
- Our wedding.
- Two years ago.

1:08:06.611 --> 1:08:07.680
Two fucking years ago.

1:08:07.714 --> 1:08:11.718
Do we even know if
they're the same people anymore?

1:08:15.487 --> 1:08:17.222
You got me.

1:08:19.391 --> 1:08:21.027
You can trust me.

1:08:21.060 --> 1:08:23.595
I know. I know.

1:08:23.628 --> 1:08:25.732
You're my best friend for life.

1:08:34.372 --> 1:08:36.676
What, what are you doing?

1:08:36.709 --> 1:08:39.679
I'm distracting you.

1:08:39.712 --> 1:08:41.446
Rowan, come on.

1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:43.683
Hey.

1:08:43.716 --> 1:08:45.584
Please.

1:08:47.754 --> 1:08:49.856
Wait.

1:08:49.889 --> 1:08:51.958
Give me a minute.

1:08:51.991 --> 1:08:53.592
Yeah.

1:09:24.489 --> 1:09:25.490
Fuck.

1:09:28.694 --> 1:09:29.896
Oh, shit.

1:09:29.929 --> 1:09:31.097
Shit!

1:10:18.211 --> 1:10:21.613
Multiple scenes like this are
playing out throughout the area.

1:10:21.647 --> 1:10:23.515
Look, this tree has just smashed

1:10:23.548 --> 1:10:25.918
not just through the roof but
through the side of the house,

1:10:25.952 --> 1:10:26.886
through the windows.

1:10:26.919 --> 1:10:29.454
A lot of the interior
of the house is exposed.

1:10:29.487 --> 1:10:31.389
Trees have fallen
on power lines,

1:10:31.423 --> 1:10:32.992
on roadways, blocking roadways,

1:10:33.025 --> 1:10:36.428
and police are urging people
to stay off the roads

1:10:36.461 --> 1:10:38.597
if at all possible,
just trying to convey

1:10:38.631 --> 1:10:40.465
how dangerous it is out here.

1:10:40.498 --> 1:10:42.702
Portions of the northeast
underwater

1:10:42.735 --> 1:10:46.639
after severe storms
pounded the region.

1:10:46.672 --> 1:10:49.008
Some streets look
more like waterways,

1:10:49.041 --> 1:10:52.845
water so high, roadblocks
floating down the streets...

1:10:55.681 --> 1:10:57.582
Babe, what's going on?

1:10:57.616 --> 1:10:59.517
What is this, James?

1:10:59.551 --> 1:11:00.253
Where... where did...

1:11:00.286 --> 1:11:02.154
- James!
- Where did you get that?

1:11:02.188 --> 1:11:04.156
Answer the question now.

1:11:05.725 --> 1:11:07.525
Babe, babe,
it was a long time ago.

1:11:07.559 --> 1:11:08.637
And you never thought
to tell me?

1:11:08.661 --> 1:11:10.863
Well, I didn't technically
know you when it...

1:11:10.897 --> 1:11:12.632
When it happened.

1:11:12.665 --> 1:11:14.432
How many times did "it" happen?

1:11:14.466 --> 1:11:15.476
I don't know, I don't know.

1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:18.570
- How many times?
- I don't know, like three.

1:11:18.603 --> 1:11:20.438
Three?

1:11:20.472 --> 1:11:22.141
Oh my god.

1:11:22.174 --> 1:11:23.174
- Three?
- Babe.

1:11:24.110 --> 1:11:25.845
- I hate you!
- Stop, stop!

1:11:25.878 --> 1:11:28.114
I hate her!
You know that I hate her!

1:11:28.147 --> 1:11:30.049
- That's why I couldn't tell you.
- I hate you!

1:11:30.082 --> 1:11:31.449
Stop, stop!

1:11:31.483 --> 1:11:32.617
Stop!

1:11:36.188 --> 1:11:37.690
I'm having an affair.

1:11:43.963 --> 1:11:46.498
What?

1:11:46.531 --> 1:11:48.000
What are you... I don't...

1:11:48.034 --> 1:11:49.869
I don't... with who?

1:11:50.670 --> 1:11:52.038
Riley.

1:11:52.071 --> 1:11:55.007
Your... your female
yoga instructor Riley?

1:11:55.041 --> 1:11:56.742
Yeah.

1:11:59.611 --> 1:12:01.080
For how long?

1:12:02.014 --> 1:12:03.883
- It's not...
- I said...

1:12:03.916 --> 1:12:06.618
For how fucking long?

1:12:06.652 --> 1:12:08.154
Over a year.

1:12:10.856 --> 1:12:11.991
A year?

1:12:12.892 --> 1:12:14.760
- I do love you.
- Apparently not enough.

1:12:14.794 --> 1:12:16.537
- No, I wanted to end it.
- I don't believe you.

1:12:16.561 --> 1:12:18.130
I was, as soon
as we got back home.

1:12:18.164 --> 1:12:21.200
Has she been to our house?
Has she slept in my bed?

1:12:23.069 --> 1:12:24.270
Answer me.

1:12:25.304 --> 1:12:26.138
I said answer me!

1:12:26.172 --> 1:12:27.106
No, she's never been
to the house.

1:12:27.139 --> 1:12:28.183
I swear to god, Rowan,
if you're lying.

1:12:28.207 --> 1:12:31.210
I'm not lying.
She's never been to the house.

1:12:31.243 --> 1:12:33.012
- I want a divorce.
- I think I'm pregnant.

1:12:33.045 --> 1:12:34.256
You're not pregnant,
you're lying.

1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:35.147
- I'm not lying.
- You're not pregnant!

1:12:35.181 --> 1:12:37.683
- You can't leave me!
- Stop talking!

1:12:37.717 --> 1:12:38.918
Stop talking.

1:12:41.821 --> 1:12:43.089
I can't believe this.

1:12:43.122 --> 1:12:46.792
I can't believe you slept with
Andy and you didn't tell me.

1:12:46.826 --> 1:12:48.593
You can't believe me?

1:12:48.626 --> 1:12:50.262
You're gay,
and you can't believe me!

1:12:50.296 --> 1:12:51.797
I am not gay!

1:12:51.831 --> 1:12:53.175
You've been having an affair
for over a year.

1:12:53.199 --> 1:12:54.443
- You gotta sorta like it.
- I don't!

1:12:54.467 --> 1:12:57.569
- Don't what? You don't what?
- Stop, stop yelling at me!

1:12:57.602 --> 1:13:00.538
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Don't you fucking touch me!

1:13:13.753 --> 1:13:15.154
- Hey, are you...
- What the...

1:13:15.187 --> 1:13:16.554
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1:13:16.588 --> 1:13:18.190
Oh my god, get out,
Gil, get out!

1:13:18.224 --> 1:13:20.135
Obviously I didn't respond
to your text fast enough.

1:13:20.159 --> 1:13:21.761
What are you talking about,
what text?

1:13:21.794 --> 1:13:23.105
The text you just
fucking sent me.

1:13:23.129 --> 1:13:26.265
- I don't even have my phone.
- What?

1:13:26.298 --> 1:13:29.735
I haven't had my phone for
hours, I can't find it anywhere.

1:13:29.769 --> 1:13:31.337
Why do you have the letters?

1:13:31.370 --> 1:13:33.339
I was looking for answers.

1:13:33.372 --> 1:13:35.607
Yeah, and I just got mine.

1:13:35.641 --> 1:13:39.345
Stop being so dramatic, dude,
just get outta here.

1:13:39.378 --> 1:13:40.780
Logan.

1:13:42.014 --> 1:13:43.015
No.

1:13:44.917 --> 1:13:46.018
Bye-bye.

1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:48.988
He's such an idiot.

1:13:49.021 --> 1:13:50.322
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

1:13:59.331 --> 1:14:01.599
Oh my god, Gil, get off him!

1:14:01.634 --> 1:14:02.835
Gil, stop!

1:14:02.868 --> 1:14:04.036
Stop, you're gonna kill him!

1:14:04.070 --> 1:14:05.704
Oh my god!

1:14:05.738 --> 1:14:06.972
Fucking psycho!

1:14:10.643 --> 1:14:12.878
- Fuck!
- Oh my god.

1:14:13.611 --> 1:14:14.947
Stop running like a little bitch

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:16.191
so I can beat the shit
out of you.

1:14:16.215 --> 1:14:17.716
With one hand?
Come on, let's go.

1:14:17.750 --> 1:14:19.185
Both of you, knock it off.

1:14:19.218 --> 1:14:21.063
Tell her. Tell her,
the only reason you asked her

1:14:21.087 --> 1:14:22.864
on a second date is because
I told you I liked her.

1:14:22.888 --> 1:14:24.032
- That's not true.
- Yeah, bullshit.

1:14:24.056 --> 1:14:26.068
Could somebody please come up
here and help me please!

1:14:26.092 --> 1:14:27.102
You couldn't just let us
be happy?

1:14:27.126 --> 1:14:28.870
You just had to get the girl
to prove a point?

1:14:28.894 --> 1:14:30.338
All she ever was to you
was a fucking point!

1:14:30.362 --> 1:14:32.264
- I loved her.
- You left her though

1:14:32.298 --> 1:14:33.999
for a goddamn internship?

1:14:34.033 --> 1:14:36.168
- Fuck you!
- Logan, what's going on?

1:14:36.202 --> 1:14:38.871
Stop it, you both
are acting like children.

1:14:38.904 --> 1:14:40.406
- You wanna see childish?
- No.

1:14:40.439 --> 1:14:42.074
You took my fucking pills?

1:14:42.108 --> 1:14:43.776
Aw, does the junkie
need his fix?

1:14:43.809 --> 1:14:45.778
- What is happening?
- Give them back to me!

1:14:45.811 --> 1:14:47.079
So pathetic!

1:14:47.113 --> 1:14:49.849
Look at you.
She'll never want you, get it?

1:14:49.882 --> 1:14:51.884
So stop trying.

1:14:51.917 --> 1:14:54.019
Never, never, huh?

1:14:54.053 --> 1:14:55.821
Bloody message on the walls
told you that?

1:14:55.855 --> 1:14:56.722
- Roger...
- No, no, no.

1:14:56.755 --> 1:14:58.757
Secrets, secrets,
are no fun, right, guys?

1:14:58.791 --> 1:15:01.827
- Stop.
- I fucked her sophomore year!

1:15:01.861 --> 1:15:03.829
Yeah, when you two
were together.

1:15:03.863 --> 1:15:05.064
Ask her.

1:15:05.097 --> 1:15:07.166
Go ahead, tell him.

1:15:08.300 --> 1:15:11.837
- Tell him, Logan!
- Roger!

1:15:11.871 --> 1:15:13.806
You cheated on me?

1:15:13.839 --> 1:15:16.142
It was complicated.

1:15:16.175 --> 1:15:17.443
How?

1:15:17.476 --> 1:15:18.844
What about Andy?

1:15:18.878 --> 1:15:20.055
Don't you think
something like this

1:15:20.079 --> 1:15:21.089
could hurt your best friend?

1:15:21.113 --> 1:15:23.282
Please, she never liked Roger,
not even when...

1:15:23.315 --> 1:15:25.151
When what?

1:15:29.755 --> 1:15:31.924
No, no, when what?
You stopped yourself.

1:15:31.957 --> 1:15:34.059
I can't believe
I came here for you.

1:15:38.464 --> 1:15:39.365
I wanted to start over.

1:15:39.398 --> 1:15:41.267
I wanted you
to come back to Seattle with me.

1:15:41.300 --> 1:15:43.035
- To start over?
- Yeah, start over.

1:15:52.077 --> 1:15:55.181
Leaving you was
the worst decision of my life.

1:15:55.214 --> 1:15:58.717
Only took you a whopping five
years to figure that out, huh?

1:15:58.751 --> 1:16:00.186
So convenient. Congratulations.

1:16:00.219 --> 1:16:02.888
Gil, stop! Gil!

1:16:09.361 --> 1:16:11.997
Whoa, Gil, stop!

1:16:12.031 --> 1:16:13.065
Stop!

1:16:13.098 --> 1:16:16.035
Stop it! Gil!

1:16:16.068 --> 1:16:18.103
Stop it!

1:16:18.137 --> 1:16:19.438
Stop!

1:16:27.980 --> 1:16:29.315
James.

1:16:31.250 --> 1:16:33.152
Have you been down here
the whole time?

1:16:33.185 --> 1:16:34.787
What are you doing
with that knife?

1:16:58.043 --> 1:16:59.478
- You.
- Andy.

1:16:59.511 --> 1:17:01.213
It was you this whole time.

1:17:01.247 --> 1:17:02.481
You brought us here.

1:17:02.514 --> 1:17:04.083
Andy, why are you covered
in blood?

1:17:04.116 --> 1:17:06.785
Because you want to destroy
our fucking lives.

1:17:06.819 --> 1:17:08.520
Why, why would you do this?

1:17:08.554 --> 1:17:09.955
Whose blood is that?

1:17:09.989 --> 1:17:11.290
Why don't you tell me?

1:17:11.323 --> 1:17:13.359
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:17:13.392 --> 1:17:15.294
Seriously?
You're gonna play innocent

1:17:15.327 --> 1:17:17.496
after all the little
fucked-up things you did to us?

1:17:17.529 --> 1:17:19.031
I swear I didn't do any of this!

1:17:19.064 --> 1:17:22.167
- Why would I do any of this?
- Because you know!

1:17:23.135 --> 1:17:26.572
- You know my secret.
- Your secret, what?

1:17:30.109 --> 1:17:32.011
- Her baby.
- What?

1:17:32.044 --> 1:17:33.979
Don't fucking do that!

1:17:34.013 --> 1:17:35.881
Call it what it is, an abortion.

1:17:35.914 --> 1:17:37.354
- You were pregnant?
- Okay, hold on.

1:17:37.383 --> 1:17:39.351
No, you know how much
this hurt me.

1:17:39.385 --> 1:17:41.086
No, no, I know
what this looks like.

1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:42.497
- No, wait!
- Tell them it's all you.

1:17:42.521 --> 1:17:44.123
- Tell us, Logan.
- It's not! I didn't...

1:17:44.156 --> 1:17:47.860
- Why are you lying?
- It's not me!

1:17:47.893 --> 1:17:50.396
You're the only one who knew.

1:17:53.265 --> 1:17:55.567
No.

1:17:55.601 --> 1:17:58.604
I wasn't the only one who knew.

1:17:58.638 --> 1:18:02.074
- You what?
- What are you talking about?

1:18:02.107 --> 1:18:03.842
I told Zach.

1:18:07.346 --> 1:18:09.448
After your appointment,
I didn't want you to be alone

1:18:09.481 --> 1:18:11.383
when I went to class,
so I told him.

1:18:11.417 --> 1:18:14.486
- No.
- He knew, he's always known.

1:18:18.190 --> 1:18:19.391
No.

1:18:23.929 --> 1:18:25.931
Zach, what is going on?

1:18:28.901 --> 1:18:31.537
I knew if anyone was gonna
figure it out, it'd be you.

1:18:31.570 --> 1:18:33.339
Wow, well done.

1:18:33.372 --> 1:18:34.506
Wow!

1:18:34.540 --> 1:18:36.008
Three days, that's good.

1:18:36.041 --> 1:18:38.510
- Is this a prank?
- No, it wasn't a prank.

1:18:38.544 --> 1:18:40.946
Not some serial killer,
it wasn't ghosts,

1:18:40.979 --> 1:18:42.281
but that was a very good guess.

1:18:42.314 --> 1:18:44.483
This is what I would call
an intervention.

1:18:44.516 --> 1:18:46.318
- You did all this?
- I did all...

1:18:46.352 --> 1:18:47.886
No... yes and no.

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:50.923
I influenced a lot,
do not get me wrong,

1:18:50.956 --> 1:18:53.225
but the rest was entirely
of your own doing.

1:18:53.258 --> 1:18:55.427
A few texts sent here and there,

1:18:55.461 --> 1:18:56.962
a vague and threatening message,

1:18:56.995 --> 1:18:59.398
an anonymous letter,
taking you all here.

1:18:59.431 --> 1:19:01.333
A little bit of fake blood
for you, my love,

1:19:01.367 --> 1:19:02.901
and then I watched
the rest unfold.

1:19:02.935 --> 1:19:06.338
I sat back and watched
all of you fucking snap!

1:19:06.372 --> 1:19:07.674
You all went insane.

1:19:07.707 --> 1:19:10.075
You, little by little,
one by one,

1:19:10.109 --> 1:19:11.977
pawns in my chess game, broke!

1:19:12.010 --> 1:19:14.513
James, you fucking broke
Gil's hand!

1:19:14.546 --> 1:19:16.081
That's goddamn awesome!

1:19:16.115 --> 1:19:17.950
- James.
- James, please calm down.

1:19:17.983 --> 1:19:20.152
Do not calm down.
James, do not calm down,

1:19:20.185 --> 1:19:22.430
because this next part, I have
a special guest appearance.

1:19:22.454 --> 1:19:25.023
It's your wife, and she's
gonna love this next part.

1:19:25.057 --> 1:19:26.492
- Rowan!
- My wife is dead!

1:19:29.027 --> 1:19:30.562
What did you say?

1:19:32.564 --> 1:19:34.433
My wife is dead.

1:19:34.466 --> 1:19:36.135
My god, Zach.

1:19:36.168 --> 1:19:37.704
- No.
- Zach!

1:19:37.737 --> 1:19:40.305
No, I...
No one was supposed to die!

1:19:40.339 --> 1:19:42.274
- Oh my god.
- She was not supposed to die.

1:19:42.307 --> 1:19:44.443
- You killed my wife.
- I killed her?

1:19:44.476 --> 1:19:45.944
I didn't touch her.

1:19:47.045 --> 1:19:49.114
I did.

1:19:49.148 --> 1:19:50.382
I did!

1:19:50.416 --> 1:19:53.452
James, what are you
talking about, man?

1:19:55.755 --> 1:19:58.090
I shoved her and killed my wife.

1:19:58.123 --> 1:19:59.726
Fuck.

1:20:05.230 --> 1:20:06.432
James...

1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:10.169
I'm sorry.

1:20:11.470 --> 1:20:12.438
That's...

1:20:12.471 --> 1:20:14.573
You're so pathetic.

1:20:14.606 --> 1:20:15.675
Look at you!

1:20:15.708 --> 1:20:17.710
The fuck are you laughing?

1:20:20.078 --> 1:20:21.613
- I'm sorry.
- This is your fault.

1:20:21.648 --> 1:20:22.749
No, it's not.

1:20:22.782 --> 1:20:24.450
I never laid my hands on her.

1:20:24.483 --> 1:20:25.752
- That was all you.
- Shut up.

1:20:25.785 --> 1:20:28.320
Hey, I didn't lay
my hands on her.

1:20:28.353 --> 1:20:30.355
- That was you, you hit her.
- Shut up, shut up!

1:20:30.389 --> 1:20:32.491
Was it off an impulse,
or did you do it slow?

1:20:32.524 --> 1:20:34.560
Shut up, I'll kill you
right now, I swear to god.

1:20:34.593 --> 1:20:37.296
I swear to god,
I'll fucking kill you, Zach.

1:20:37.329 --> 1:20:39.298
I swear to god.

1:20:39.331 --> 1:20:41.467
Okay.

1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:42.601
Easy, tiger.

1:20:42.635 --> 1:20:45.270
I got you, it's okay.

1:20:45.304 --> 1:20:46.673
Do it.

1:20:46.706 --> 1:20:48.207
Okay?

1:20:49.776 --> 1:20:50.777
Do it.

1:20:50.810 --> 1:20:53.612
- Hey, hey, it's okay.
- James, grab that gun.

1:20:53.646 --> 1:20:56.582
- Don't. Gil, stop.
- Take it. Take it.

1:20:56.615 --> 1:20:59.218
- Grab the gun from him, James.
- No.

1:20:59.251 --> 1:21:01.053
- James, stop!
- There you go, there you go.

1:21:01.086 --> 1:21:02.397
- Shoot him, shoot him.
- No, no, no, no!

1:21:02.421 --> 1:21:04.132
James, please do it,
you said you wanted to do it,

1:21:04.156 --> 1:21:05.600
I'm giving you the opportunity,
please do it.

1:21:05.624 --> 1:21:08.227
Don't kill him,
please don't kill him, please.

1:21:08.260 --> 1:21:09.705
- What are you doing, man?
- He wants this,

1:21:09.729 --> 1:21:11.105
he's trying to get
inside your head.

1:21:11.129 --> 1:21:12.307
I'm already inside
your head, James!

1:21:12.331 --> 1:21:13.609
- Shut up.
- That's why you broke

1:21:13.633 --> 1:21:15.678
your best friend's hand, that's
why you murdered your wife.

1:21:15.702 --> 1:21:17.135
I have complete control
over you.

1:21:17.169 --> 1:21:19.605
- Just fucking do it.
- Shut up, shut up!

1:21:19.639 --> 1:21:22.074
Shut the fuck up, Zach,
I'll fucking kill you right now!

1:21:22.107 --> 1:21:24.711
- I'm asking you to!
- Make it stop.

1:21:24.744 --> 1:21:27.112
How long was she cheating
on you, James?

1:21:27.145 --> 1:21:29.716
How long was she pretending
that she loved you?

1:21:32.117 --> 1:21:33.619
Oh, she did tell him.

1:21:33.653 --> 1:21:35.554
Guys.

1:21:35.587 --> 1:21:37.289
He's taunting you, man,
shoot him!

1:21:37.322 --> 1:21:39.091
Is that what made you kill her?

1:21:39.124 --> 1:21:40.359
Shut up the fuck up, Zach.

1:21:40.392 --> 1:21:41.460
Stop it.

1:21:41.493 --> 1:21:43.428
James, he is taunting you,
shoot him!

1:21:43.462 --> 1:21:45.364
I am taunting you,
and you should shoot me,

1:21:45.397 --> 1:21:48.668
but listen, before you do,
did she confess anything else?

1:21:48.701 --> 1:21:50.770
This is friend to friend,
I'm just asking.

1:21:50.803 --> 1:21:53.372
Did she tell you what else
she was hiding from you?

1:21:53.405 --> 1:21:55.245
- Stop it, Zach, please.
- James, listen to me.

1:21:55.274 --> 1:21:56.685
- Listen to me.
- There was nothing else.

1:21:56.709 --> 1:21:58.711
We surveyed
our audience here, okay?

1:21:58.745 --> 1:22:00.522
- Shut up, Zach.
- And before tonight's broadcast,

1:22:00.546 --> 1:22:02.214
survey says...

1:22:03.850 --> 1:22:05.852
She didn't want
to have your baby.

1:22:05.885 --> 1:22:08.153
She never did.

1:22:08.186 --> 1:22:09.789
Now, granted,
had things worked out

1:22:09.822 --> 1:22:11.691
with you and Andy
back in college, maybe...

1:22:11.724 --> 1:22:13.525
- Shut up!
- You're just letting him talk.

1:22:13.559 --> 1:22:15.294
Shoot him!

1:22:15.327 --> 1:22:17.195
Do it, do it.

1:22:17.229 --> 1:22:18.397
Come on, please.

1:22:18.430 --> 1:22:20.599
Fucking do it.

1:22:20.633 --> 1:22:23.435
James, do it.

1:22:23.468 --> 1:22:25.404
Please.

1:22:25.437 --> 1:22:27.372
Motherfucker, fucking do it!

1:22:27.406 --> 1:22:29.107
Pull the trigger!

1:22:32.377 --> 1:22:33.612
- James.
- I'm not a murderer.

1:22:33.646 --> 1:22:35.480
James.

1:22:35.514 --> 1:22:37.115
- Neither was I.
- Zach...

1:22:39.752 --> 1:22:41.520
Zach, no!

1:22:41.553 --> 1:22:43.255
James!

1:22:43.288 --> 1:22:44.623
James, stay with me!

1:22:44.657 --> 1:22:46.124
Hey, hey, look at me!

1:22:46.158 --> 1:22:47.426
James, James, look at me!

1:22:47.459 --> 1:22:49.227
- James!
- You fucked it up!

1:22:49.261 --> 1:22:51.430
You fucking idiot, you fucked...

1:22:51.463 --> 1:22:54.701
You fucked... you fucked it up!

1:22:54.734 --> 1:22:56.736
- Why?!
- Hey, hey, look at me.

1:22:56.769 --> 1:22:58.871
Hey!

1:23:00.439 --> 1:23:02.407
- James!
- You fuck...

1:23:02.441 --> 1:23:03.752
You know, if you were
a real doctor,

1:23:03.776 --> 1:23:05.544
you could probably save him,
it's a shame.

1:23:10.415 --> 1:23:11.751
You fucking psychopath!

1:23:11.784 --> 1:23:13.753
He wasn't supposed to die!

1:23:13.786 --> 1:23:15.755
I didn't want anyone to die!

1:23:15.788 --> 1:23:17.356
He was...

1:23:17.389 --> 1:23:18.590
He fucking ruined everything.

1:23:18.624 --> 1:23:20.525
He fucking...
He fucking ruined everything.

1:23:20.559 --> 1:23:22.570
Zach, listen to me,
what is the point of this, Zach?

1:23:22.594 --> 1:23:23.663
Two people are now dead.

1:23:23.696 --> 1:23:26.231
Because no one
ever listens to me!

1:23:26.264 --> 1:23:27.532
Because I'm Zach!

1:23:27.566 --> 1:23:30.670
I'm kind, gentle, pushover Zach!

1:23:30.703 --> 1:23:32.839
I'm everyone's shoulder
to cry on!

1:23:32.872 --> 1:23:34.674
I'm everyone's secret-keeper!

1:23:34.707 --> 1:23:36.676
I'm everyone's
fucking punching bag!

1:23:36.709 --> 1:23:39.344
We trusted you, man,
we told you our secrets.

1:23:39.378 --> 1:23:40.889
You should feel honored,
not fucking crazy.

1:23:40.913 --> 1:23:44.182
Honored? Honored to know
that you slept consistently

1:23:44.216 --> 1:23:46.686
with the only girl
I've ever been in love with,

1:23:46.719 --> 1:23:48.655
but you were supposed
to be my best friend?

1:23:48.688 --> 1:23:51.658
- I stopped once you told me.
- You knew!

1:23:53.258 --> 1:23:54.626
There's no way you didn't know.

1:23:54.661 --> 1:23:56.261
Zach, please don't do this,
okay?

1:23:56.294 --> 1:23:57.964
Why? Because you love him?

1:23:57.997 --> 1:24:00.833
Who cares?
No one ever cared how I felt!

1:24:00.867 --> 1:24:02.501
Okay, that's enough.

1:24:02.534 --> 1:24:04.837
All of us knew
that you liked Andy.

1:24:04.871 --> 1:24:08.775
- I mean, don't you think...
- Don't interrupt me!

1:24:08.808 --> 1:24:12.310
It is my turn to fucking talk.

1:24:12.344 --> 1:24:14.279
Why, why are you doing this?

1:24:14.312 --> 1:24:15.590
Oh, why don't you
tell them, babe?

1:24:15.614 --> 1:24:17.582
I think you know exactly
why I'm doing this.

1:24:17.616 --> 1:24:19.484
- I didn't mean to.
- Stop crying!

1:24:19.518 --> 1:24:21.520
Just tell them.

1:24:21.553 --> 1:24:24.222
His wrists, look at his wrists.

1:24:25.323 --> 1:24:29.294
You all abandoned me.

1:24:29.327 --> 1:24:30.495
All of you.

1:24:33.265 --> 1:24:35.768
I'm sorry.

1:24:35.802 --> 1:24:37.369
- Your turn, Roger.
- What?

1:24:37.402 --> 1:24:38.537
Come on, don't be bashful.

1:24:38.570 --> 1:24:40.272
I'm not the only one
who's tried.

1:24:41.708 --> 1:24:44.443
- How did you know that?
- You tried to kill yourself?

1:24:44.476 --> 1:24:45.477
Twice.

1:24:47.312 --> 1:24:49.682
Yeah, I, uh...

1:24:49.716 --> 1:24:51.516
I overdosed twice.

1:24:51.550 --> 1:24:53.418
Um, once on accident,

1:24:53.452 --> 1:24:56.823
and the other on purpose,
last year.

1:24:56.856 --> 1:24:58.758
- How did you know?
- You can try and transform

1:24:58.791 --> 1:25:01.259
yourself into Gil all you want,
but I think deep down,

1:25:01.293 --> 1:25:03.304
you're always gonna be
a sad, pathetic little junkie.

1:25:03.328 --> 1:25:05.564
- Shut the fuck up!
- Zach, give me the gun!

1:25:05.597 --> 1:25:09.501
Stop, stop, just stop trying
to save him.

1:25:09.534 --> 1:25:11.637
You can't save guys like us.

1:25:11.671 --> 1:25:13.806
Okay, okay, I get it.

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:15.675
Okay, lesson learned.

1:25:15.708 --> 1:25:18.911
Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

1:25:18.945 --> 1:25:21.047
- I'm not a fucking kid.
- I'm not talking to you

1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:24.449
like you're a child, Zach,
please, just listen!

1:25:24.483 --> 1:25:27.053
James and Rowan,
their marriage was toxic, okay?

1:25:27.086 --> 1:25:29.521
You said there was an affair,
right, there was an affair,

1:25:29.554 --> 1:25:31.924
so I can... I can make it
all go away, okay?

1:25:31.958 --> 1:25:33.391
It's easy, it's easy, okay?

1:25:33.425 --> 1:25:34.636
I can help you, Zach,
just let me...

1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:35.962
I don't want your help!

1:25:35.995 --> 1:25:38.831
I don't need
your help now, Logan!

1:25:38.865 --> 1:25:39.999
I did!

1:25:40.032 --> 1:25:41.734
I would've loved it before!

1:25:41.768 --> 1:25:43.836
But no!

1:25:43.870 --> 1:25:46.072
I called all of you

1:25:46.105 --> 1:25:48.607
the day that...

1:25:48.641 --> 1:25:50.342
None of you answered,

1:25:50.375 --> 1:25:52.310
and I called all of you
three times,

1:25:52.344 --> 1:25:54.981
and no one even called me back.

1:25:55.014 --> 1:25:57.083
It's too late!

1:25:58.617 --> 1:26:00.787
You guys are just too late.

1:26:01.888 --> 1:26:03.790
- You're just too late.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:26:03.823 --> 1:26:06.993
Okay, you wanna shoot somebody,
man, shoot... shoot me.

1:26:07.026 --> 1:26:08.593
Okay, it's my fucking fault.

1:26:08.627 --> 1:26:10.830
I slept with Andy, I'm the one

1:26:10.863 --> 1:26:12.007
who didn't tell Logan
how I felt.

1:26:12.031 --> 1:26:14.332
I'm the only reason
we've been friends with Gil,

1:26:14.366 --> 1:26:17.003
and with fucking James,
so just... just shoot me, man.

1:26:17.036 --> 1:26:19.404
Just, please.

1:26:19.437 --> 1:26:21.908
All I ever wanted was
for you guys to listen.

1:26:23.910 --> 1:26:25.711
Andy, I loved you,

1:26:25.745 --> 1:26:28.346
and you could've changed this
for everyone.

1:26:28.380 --> 1:26:29.481
Please, Zach.

1:26:31.550 --> 1:26:34.452
Now you all have
one more secret to keep.

1:26:37.757 --> 1:26:39.058
Please.

1:26:51.137 --> 1:26:55.574
The seven of us have always been
a really deadly combination.

1:27:29.175 --> 1:27:31.010
Oh my god.

1:27:31.043 --> 1:27:33.713
- Oh my god, Zach, no.
- Andy, stop.

1:27:34.881 --> 1:27:36.716
Andy, do not touch him.

1:27:36.749 --> 1:27:39.618
- What?
- I said, do not touch him.

1:27:39.652 --> 1:27:41.721
Back away.

1:27:42.922 --> 1:27:44.690
Oh my god, oh my god.

1:27:44.724 --> 1:27:47.592
Andy, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

1:27:47.626 --> 1:27:49.896
Back up!

1:27:49.929 --> 1:27:52.098
Get away from him.

1:28:00.072 --> 1:28:01.974
Okay.

1:28:02.008 --> 1:28:05.011
Okay, this is what
we're gonna do.

1:28:05.044 --> 1:28:07.079
Andy, I need you to get up.

1:28:07.113 --> 1:28:10.448
Andy, I need you to get up.
Get up, Andy. Get up!

1:28:12.885 --> 1:28:15.453
I need you to go upstairs,
I need you to shower,

1:28:15.487 --> 1:28:17.790
I need you to put those clothes
in a garbage bag, okay?

1:28:17.823 --> 1:28:20.793
Gil, I have to wrap your arm,
we gotta stop the bleeding.

1:28:20.826 --> 1:28:23.595
We gotta strip all the sheets,
we gotta start washing them.

1:28:23.628 --> 1:28:25.207
Roger, you gotta collect
all the garbage, okay?

1:28:25.231 --> 1:28:26.332
Any paper, any bottles,

1:28:26.365 --> 1:28:28.668
anything lying around
that could trace us back here,

1:28:28.701 --> 1:28:30.646
and I'm gonna start wiping down
all of the furniture

1:28:30.670 --> 1:28:32.504
to get rid
of the fingerprints, okay?

1:28:32.537 --> 1:28:33.873
I have gloves in my car.

1:28:33.906 --> 1:28:36.474
Every single one of you
are wearing them!

1:28:36.508 --> 1:28:39.544
Zach just killed himself,
Rowan and James are dead,

1:28:39.577 --> 1:28:41.714
they're fucking dead!

1:28:41.747 --> 1:28:43.515
You're right, they're dead,

1:28:43.548 --> 1:28:45.651
so we have to protect ourselves.

1:28:45.685 --> 1:28:47.552
No, we...

1:28:47.585 --> 1:28:49.855
- We need to call the police.
- No.

1:28:49.889 --> 1:28:51.589
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:28:51.623 --> 1:28:54.060
Listen to me,
we cannot call the police, okay?

1:28:54.093 --> 1:28:55.861
Because if we call them
and we tell them

1:28:55.895 --> 1:28:57.229
exactly how everything happened,

1:28:57.263 --> 1:28:58.998
they're going to bring us in
for questioning

1:28:59.031 --> 1:29:01.267
and we're gonna remain guilty
until proven innocent,

1:29:01.300 --> 1:29:05.638
and they will still pin it
on one of us,

1:29:05.671 --> 1:29:08.240
and I'm not going to jail.

1:29:12.678 --> 1:29:14.914
Okay?

1:29:14.947 --> 1:29:17.683
Is anyone else still opposed?

1:29:25.057 --> 1:29:27.727
All righty then.

1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:29.729
Let's start cleaning.

1:29:37.803 --> 1:29:38.871
No.

1:29:38.904 --> 1:29:41.007
Fuck! Fuck!

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:43.175
Oh god.

1:29:43.209 --> 1:29:45.011
You can still tie it up.

1:29:48.647 --> 1:29:53.551
You see, humans are
extremely simple creatures...

1:29:57.089 --> 1:29:59.825
Each individually formulated

1:29:59.859 --> 1:30:03.195
by a mixture
of both light and dark,

1:30:03.229 --> 1:30:06.098
good and evil.

1:30:06.132 --> 1:30:09.135
Most are balanced of the two,

1:30:09.168 --> 1:30:13.239
and the others... not.

1:30:13.272 --> 1:30:16.275
But then there are the immoral,

1:30:16.308 --> 1:30:20.179
the message, the warnings
to the rectifiable,

1:30:20.212 --> 1:30:23.749
although forgiven by god
are damned to a life

1:30:23.783 --> 1:30:28.054
of predetermined torment
by their sin,

1:30:28.087 --> 1:30:34.260
consumed by a life
of only wrong decisions.

1:30:34.293 --> 1:30:38.164
The glutton, no temperance.

1:30:38.197 --> 1:30:41.133
The greedy, no charity.

1:30:41.167 --> 1:30:44.303
The wrath, no Patience.

1:30:44.336 --> 1:30:48.240
The envious, no kindness.

1:30:48.274 --> 1:30:52.678
The lustful, no self-control.

1:30:52.711 --> 1:30:56.715
The sloth, no zeal.

1:30:56.749 --> 1:31:00.386
And the proud,

1:31:00.419 --> 1:31:03.089
no humility.

1:31:05.357 --> 1:31:07.726
No happiness.

1:31:10.029 --> 1:31:11.263
No virtues.

1:31:16.802 --> 1:31:18.170
No end.

1:31:22.908 --> 1:31:25.344
The story will never end.

1:31:30.015 --> 1:31:32.184
- Zach?
- Yeah.

1:31:33.752 --> 1:31:35.788
How are they healing?
