09:40.027 --> 09:41.928
your brother, your nephew,
your housekeeper...

09:41.929 --> 09:44.230
Yeah, I know--
No, no, no.
I'm not done.

your gambling,

you draw the line?

09:53.107 --> 09:55.308

arbitrary.

Don't forget
the pre-op lifeguard.

a bulge in that bikini bottom.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.388
The point is, it's like...

13:28.389 --> 13:30.690
it's like Rose has
some kind of sixth sense

13:30.691 --> 13:32.976
where she knows when
I'm about to be happy.

13:32.977 --> 13:36.062

she follows you around
