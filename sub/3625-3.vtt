Serena van der Woodsen.

Everybody's favorite
It girl has just returned

00:15.276 --> 00:18.409
from a mysterious absence
and was learning the hard way

that you can never
go home again.

You'll never believe
what's on "Gossip Girl."

00:24.720 --> 00:26.591
Someone saw Serena getting
off a train at Grand Central.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.202
Serena?

00:28.289 --> 00:29.594
Serena's at school.

00:29.681 --> 00:30.943
Why'd she return?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.249
Let me guess,
you told everyone

00:32.336 --> 00:34.556
Eric's just visiting
grandpa in Rhode Island.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.166
Your Aunt Carol in Miami.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.212
He tries to take his own life,
and you're worried

00:38.299 --> 00:40.127
it's gonna cost you
mom of the year?

00:40.214 --> 00:41.606
Must be a lot of rumors
why you're back.

00:41.693 --> 00:42.912
None of them mention you.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.131
Nate's gonna wait for Serena.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.958
He can get in line
behind that guy.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.049
I don't need some
new boy influencing her

00:49.136 --> 00:50.572
distracting her
from her needs.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.791
A kid like Dan is exactly
what Serena needs.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.967
- Guess who's dad is cool?
- It's a trick question.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.230
Yeah 'cause it can't be ours.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.535
You're going out with Serena

00:57.622 --> 00:59.668
and I'm going
to Kiss on the Lips.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.757
Who said this family
wasn't cool?

01:01.844 --> 01:03.280
I thought everything
was good between us.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.847
It was...before I found out

01:04.934 --> 01:05.848
you had sex
with my boyfriend.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.590
Great, just in time for brunch.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.506
I told her to stay away.

01:11.593 --> 01:12.898
I'm not sneaking around
with you.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.074
Just to talk.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.338
You said you'd never
speak to her again!

01:17.425 --> 01:19.035
So you slept with your
best friend's boyfriend.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.384
Is that true?

01:20.471 --> 01:21.690
Then she ran away

01:21.777 --> 01:23.126
...and lied about it.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.085
Poor Daniel,
so little time

01:25.172 --> 01:26.608
so many sluts to defend.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.787
This world, it, it's crazy.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.963

01:34.050 --> 01:35.704
Blair, how can I fix this?

01:35.791 --> 01:37.314
You don't, Serena.

01:38.663 --> 01:39.795
You just stay away.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.449
But now that Serena is back

01:41.536 --> 01:43.842
will the Upper East Side
ever be the same?

01:43.929 --> 01:46.497
It takes two to tangle,
and girls like these

01:46.584 --> 01:49.196
don't go down
without a fight.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.850
[Gossip Girl]
Where's she been, Serena?
And who am I?

01:51.937 --> 01:53.809
That's one secret
I'll never tell.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.942

20:29.837 --> 20:31.012
Maybe there was a mix-up.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.361
Some kind of a glitch
in the system?

20:32.448 --> 20:33.710
I'd like to believe
that because

20:33.797 --> 20:34.755
I like to believe
the best in people.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.147
I'm sorry, Mr. Humphrey

20:36.235 --> 20:37.932
the usher positions
have been filled.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.499
There's nothing we can do.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.762
Uh, is...there anything else?

20:41.849 --> 20:43.024
Any other positions?

20:43.111 --> 20:44.765
Uh, you'll have
to discuss this

20:44.852 --> 20:46.549
with our
committee chairwoman.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.377
Sure, perfect, I'd love to.
Where can I find her?

20:48.464 --> 20:51.075
I'm not sure, she must
be running late, I..

20:51.162 --> 20:53.164
Oh, there she is now.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.257
Why am I not surprised?

20:58.344 --> 21:01.651
Lucky for you, she seems
to be in a good mood.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.131
Until she sees me.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.352
- Rufus.
- Told ya.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.484
Excuse me.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.746
You got a minute, Lil?

21:09.833 --> 21:11.400
Uh, not for you.

21:13.446 --> 21:16.318
[instrumental music]

21:21.584 --> 21:24.152
- You're in.
- What?

21:24.239 --> 21:25.588
The Ivy Week party tonight.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.287
Your name will be on
the program and everything.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.897
You got me the Dartmouth spot?

21:29.984 --> 21:31.159
I knew you could do it, dad.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.553
No, you didn't.
And no, I didn't.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.250
How do you feel about
the refreshment committee?

21:35.337 --> 21:37.339
Well, there is, there is
no refreshment committee.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.601
Not until now.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.037
Oh, God.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.648
What?
Everybody gets thirsty.

21:41.735 --> 21:42.997
It's really
a position of power.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.607
How did you secure me
this prominent

21:44.694 --> 21:46.305
and simultaneously
embarrassing position?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.045
By offering my own services.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.787
You-you're serving snacks?

21:50.874 --> 21:52.789
I'm the head of
the entertainment committee.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.270
[laughs]

21:55.357 --> 21:56.619
A-another committee
that didn't exist

21:56.706 --> 21:57.925
until you left
the house today.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.318
Way to go, dad.

21:59.405 --> 22:00.841
Wait, so who's
the entertainment?

22:00.928 --> 22:02.756
Uh, since it was
such short notice

22:02.843 --> 22:05.541
the only person
I could get was myself.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.630
Kind of a staid affair
for early '90s

22:07.717 --> 22:09.763
post-punk mass rock,
don't you think?

22:09.850 --> 22:11.721
I'm bringing
a couple of the guys.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.244
It'll be Rufus unplugged.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.464
- Need a roadie?
- Thanks, sweetie.

22:15.551 --> 22:16.857
[Dan]
'Should I call mom
and we can just'

22:16.944 --> 22:18.815
make this a full-fledged
Humphrey affair?

22:18.902 --> 22:21.818
Look, I did
the best I could.

22:21.905 --> 22:24.168
At least you get to officially
be a part of this thing.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.345
You can talk
to that author you love.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.824
'Ask him anything you want.'

22:27.911 --> 22:29.957
Like his, uh,
preference for soft drinks?

22:33.917 --> 22:35.397
If you get at all
anxious, sweetie

22:35.484 --> 22:37.268
if you feel light-headed
or panicky--

22:37.356 --> 22:39.358
I'll be fine, mom.
All I have to do is be normal.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.449
Or at least act normal.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.364
Works for mom.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.369
[instrumental music]

22:58.986 --> 23:01.858
[indistinct chattering]

23:06.167 --> 23:07.951
Do you see the Yale rep?

23:08.038 --> 23:09.344
I thought you wanted
to go to Brown

23:09.431 --> 23:11.390
and Blair wanted
to go to Yale.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.088
Yeah, I know.

23:16.133 --> 23:19.006
[music continues]

23:22.096 --> 23:24.707
My father would never forgive me
if I didn't introduce myself.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.535
He says that you two
used to do crew together.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.058
Crew?

23:28.145 --> 23:30.800
Oh, hi.
I'm Serena van der Woodsen.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.715
Blair, I didn't know you
were interested in doing crew.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.631
I'm not, I was just saying that
there's a family connection--

23:35.718 --> 23:38.765
In fact, I didn't know you were
interested in athletics at all.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.767
Well, especially ones where
you might get your hair wet.

23:40.854 --> 23:44.814
Well, she's really more
of an indoors type of girl.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.382
Oh, my goodness,
your glass is almost empty.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.645
- Let's get you a drink.
- Uh, no, I'll take him.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.473
Oh, don't worry about it.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.344
So tell me about Yale.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.745
Can you please explain
how Serena's commandeering

24:02.832 --> 24:05.400
the Yale rep while you're
supposed to be his usher?

24:05.487 --> 24:06.836
I switched.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.798
I'm trying to get
into Princeton.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.104
Oh, don't get your
la perlasina bunch.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.803
Look who's arrived,
Dr. Osteroff.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.544
Blair, Dr. Donald Osteroff.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.676
Interesting choice
of guests, B.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.026
Such a pleasure, I've heard
such wonderful things..

24:23.113 --> 24:25.464
Coincidence? I think not.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.990
[instrumental music]

24:30.817 --> 24:32.296
I liked your book.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.907
Oh, thanks.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.344
What did you think
of the epilogue?

24:36.431 --> 24:37.998
Some people really love it.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.696
But "The New York Times"
called it a cheap cop-out.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.568
"Warner Brothers"
is making a movie.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.178
I think they're gonna
change the end.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.181
Well, I can see how the ending
might not seem all that..

24:47.268 --> 24:48.704
...commercial.

24:50.706 --> 24:54.057
Uh...would you like
something to drink?

24:54.144 --> 24:55.842
Lily, hello.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.192
Oh, Bart, hello.
How are you?

24:59.672 --> 25:01.543
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.024
How's, uh, Miami?

25:04.111 --> 25:07.288
It was good, thanks.
You know, go, Marlins.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.116
[laughing]

25:09.203 --> 25:11.422
Would you excuse me, please?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.599
So the neuroscience project
I'm working on involves

25:13.686 --> 25:14.991
the cellular signaling pathway

25:15.078 --> 25:17.037
of neuronal
nitric oxide synthase.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.866
It's initiated when
glutamate binds to NMDAR..

25:23.739 --> 25:25.828
Hi.
You're Eric, right?

25:25.915 --> 25:28.135
Yeah, you're Jenny.
Dan's sister, right?

25:28.222 --> 25:30.224
- Yeah, we, um, met at--
- Bendel's.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.574
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh, cool.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.402
Eric, good to see you.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.621
You enjoy Miami?

25:35.708 --> 25:37.318
Uh, yeah.

25:37.405 --> 25:38.537
S-save the manatees.

25:42.279 --> 25:44.194
- Manatees?
- It's a long story.

25:44.281 --> 25:46.240
I've got time.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.372
It's a little dark and..

25:48.459 --> 25:49.591
I can handle it.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.681
You wanna go to Yale, then?

25:52.768 --> 25:55.902
No, Brown.
It's just this thing with Blair.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.643
Oh, yeah, yeah, I get it.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.383
I mean, since you don't
have to actually worry

25:59.470 --> 26:00.602
about getting into college

26:00.689 --> 26:02.038
why not make
the entire evening

26:02.125 --> 26:03.605
about screwing over Blair?

26:06.652 --> 26:07.957
No, thanks.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.699
Hey.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.530
Wait, you're seriously
not gonna talk to me?

26:17.184 --> 26:18.968
Like, literally not speak?

26:20.448 --> 26:21.580
Hey.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.452
Oh, much better.

26:26.106 --> 26:27.629
Thanks, guys.

26:31.372 --> 26:35.245
So, um...what's he like?

26:35.332 --> 26:37.552
Like a Dartmouth
English lit professor

26:37.639 --> 26:40.033
I have nothing in common with.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.687
Guess I could tell him
how everything I have

26:41.774 --> 26:44.603
I got because
I'm an Archibald.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.783
You should mention Dr. Seuss.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.568
Theodor Geisel is his real name.
He went to Dartmouth.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.135
Um...Hall said he got the idea

26:55.222 --> 26:56.658
for "The Petting Zoo"
from "The Lorax."

26:56.745 --> 26:59.095
- The what?
- Um..

26:59.182 --> 27:00.183
You know what?
Never mind.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.750
Just mention how
his prose style

27:01.837 --> 27:03.534
is influenced
by early Faulkner.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.059
You'll be alright.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.191
Uh...or not.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.457
I was actually gonna
get some fresh air.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.198
How about you
take these over to him?

27:19.289 --> 27:20.856
Alright.

27:20.943 --> 27:22.684
Yeah, I guess
I could leave my post

27:22.771 --> 27:24.643
unmanned for a minute
or two.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.171
[instrumental music]

27:46.926 --> 27:48.362
- Where are you going?
- Home.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.016
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.148
Now you get back out there
and you finish what you started.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.715
You mean,
what you started?

27:53.802 --> 27:56.370
I don't wanna go
to Dartmouth.

27:56.457 --> 27:59.068
There, I said it.
Now back off.

28:03.246 --> 28:06.510
So we moved into
the hotel and, uh..

28:06.597 --> 28:08.599
...it was just
the two of us.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.254
And I was really lonely.

28:11.341 --> 28:13.256
So..

28:13.343 --> 28:14.997
...that's when you..

28:18.784 --> 28:20.699
So I ended up at
the Osteroff Center.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.266
And my mom says that they
have the best counselors.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.528
But what they
really get paid for

28:24.615 --> 28:26.400
is to to keep
their mouths shut.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.402
Look, I-I won't
say anything.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.232
I promise.

28:35.365 --> 28:38.107
So do you wanna
go back in?

28:38.194 --> 28:39.979
Yeah and answer more
questions about Florida?

28:40.066 --> 28:43.156
Well, I have a grandma
who lives in Fort Myers.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.201
I can help think of
some material.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.689
May I please have
everyone's attention?

28:56.952 --> 28:58.562
'Welcome again to
the Constance Billard'

28:58.649 --> 29:00.521
St. Jude's Ivy Week mixer.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.218
I'm Blair Waldorf

29:02.305 --> 29:04.090
chair of the community
outreach committee.

29:04.177 --> 29:07.049
[audience applauding]

29:10.270 --> 29:13.316
Every year, our schools choose
to support one local institution

29:13.403 --> 29:16.102
that we feel
benefits our community.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.930
This year,
our schools have chosen

29:18.017 --> 29:20.497
to honor the Osteroff Center.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.457
[audience applauding]

29:27.678 --> 29:31.595
This semester, our choice
is a very personal one

29:31.682 --> 29:33.859
because the center has
helped one of our own.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.774
What is going on here?

29:35.861 --> 29:37.645
[Blair]
'It's because of their
excellent program'

29:37.732 --> 29:41.083
which aids so many young
addicts and alcoholics

29:41.170 --> 29:42.824
that a student here
with us today

29:42.911 --> 29:45.871
is clean and sober.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.307
At least, for now.

29:47.394 --> 29:48.787
Can I please have
Serena van der Woodsen

29:48.874 --> 29:51.180
join me on stage?

29:51.267 --> 29:53.617
Spotted at the Ivy Week mixer

29:53.704 --> 29:55.794
S and B's last stand.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.535
And only one gets out alive.

29:58.622 --> 29:59.928
Better take cover.

30:03.845 --> 30:04.977
Please tell me
this isn't happening.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.282
It's not.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.850
No...you're not
going up there.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.331
You're gonna stay
right here, okay?

30:11.418 --> 30:13.376
Whatever you're doing,
think about

30:13.463 --> 30:14.769
who's standing
in this room right now.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.951
Don't try to deny it.
Chuck saw you.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.871
[audience applauding]

30:29.958 --> 30:32.787
Hi, I'm Serena van der Woodsen.

30:34.789 --> 30:38.880
I just wanna thank
my friend, Blair Waldorf

30:38.967 --> 30:41.187
for recognizing
the Osteroff Center

30:41.274 --> 30:43.624
'and all of the good things
that they do.'

30:43.711 --> 30:44.930
Thanks, Blair.

30:49.543 --> 30:52.067
At the center,
one of the main things

30:52.154 --> 30:54.113
that we learn
is forgiveness.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.202
- She's in rehab?
- No, it's not her.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.638
It's her brother
who's there.

30:57.725 --> 31:00.206
- What?
- You can't tell anyone, okay?

31:00.293 --> 31:02.338
I won't, but why
is she doing this?

31:02.425 --> 31:04.950
[Serena]
'...about how..'

31:05.037 --> 31:07.430
...in order to move forward
with our future

31:07.517 --> 31:11.521
we must forgive those who
have wronged us in the past.

31:11.608 --> 31:14.655
'And we must ourselves
ask for forgiveness'

31:14.742 --> 31:16.396
from those whom we've wronged.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.267
[audience applauding]

31:18.354 --> 31:20.879
Without this forgiveness,
innocent people get hurt--

31:20.966 --> 31:23.969
Alright, thank you, Serena.
Thank you. Thank you.

31:24.056 --> 31:27.189
Honesty may be the best
policy in some zip codes

31:27.276 --> 31:30.453
but not in this one,
and not this week

31:30.540 --> 31:33.413
'Cause I was
a teenage drug addict

31:33.500 --> 31:36.068
is not exactly
a winning college essay.

31:39.723 --> 31:42.988
And now can I please have
Dr. Osteroff join me onstage?

31:43.075 --> 31:44.380
Why is Blair outing you

31:44.467 --> 31:47.035
for a drug problem
that you don't have?

31:47.122 --> 31:49.037
- You don't, do you?
- Mom!

31:49.124 --> 31:51.126
Well, it's not like we have
some free, open relationship.

31:51.213 --> 31:53.520
And that's my fault?

31:53.607 --> 31:55.043
Look, what's happened
to Eric has put

31:55.130 --> 31:58.046
a huge strain on
our family.

31:58.133 --> 32:00.440
But we are still a family.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.746
Why do you think
I did what I just did?

32:05.836 --> 32:07.708
Will you excuse me?

32:07.795 --> 32:10.711
I'm gonna go end
this with Blair...now.

32:16.804 --> 32:19.850
Blair, what the hell was that?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.635
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Sure.

32:24.725 --> 32:27.075
So we good now?
We square?

32:27.162 --> 32:29.904
No, because nothing
I do will ever

32:29.991 --> 32:31.819
be as bad as
what you did to me.

32:31.906 --> 32:33.908
Look, I'm asking you, please.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.518
I'll stop if you will.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.608
You're just saying that
because today you lost.

32:38.695 --> 32:41.220
And you're gonna
keep losing.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.830
Now if you'll excuse me,
unlike you

32:42.917 --> 32:44.875
I have a future
to get back to.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.411
Serena.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.413
- Serena!
- What?

33:00.500 --> 33:01.762
What, do you wanna
congratulate me

33:01.849 --> 33:03.372
on destroying my future?

33:03.459 --> 33:05.331
No, no, I just wanted
to ask if you're okay

33:05.418 --> 33:08.421
'cause what you did in there,
for your brother, that was..

33:08.508 --> 33:10.118
That was very cool.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.206
Wait, how did you know
about my brother?

33:11.293 --> 33:12.947
It-it's okay.

33:13.034 --> 33:16.951
Really, no one will
ever hear it from me.

33:17.038 --> 33:20.085
But if you ever need
anybody to talk to

33:20.172 --> 33:23.610
or not talk to

33:23.697 --> 33:26.134
I'd be happy to do either.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.397
I'll keep that in mind.

33:28.484 --> 33:31.052
And, um..

33:31.139 --> 33:34.142
I know I said
some things about you

33:34.229 --> 33:36.449
and your world..

33:36.536 --> 33:38.799
...and I'm sorry.

33:38.886 --> 33:40.844
Obviously, I don't know

33:40.931 --> 33:42.672
anything about your life.

33:44.457 --> 33:48.069
Thank you, but I've really
got to get out of here.

33:48.156 --> 33:50.376
Yeah, sure, sure.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.681
'But..'

33:51.768 --> 33:53.161
...maybe, you know

33:53.248 --> 33:54.641
I can take you up on that

33:54.728 --> 33:57.339
getting together and not
talking thing sometime?

33:59.907 --> 34:01.082
Will you call me?

34:02.605 --> 34:03.563
Yeah.

34:10.265 --> 34:13.268
Okay, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

34:13.355 --> 34:16.097
No, there's someone
I need to talk to first.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.578
Please, mom,
I can do this.

34:18.665 --> 34:19.840
Okay.

34:21.407 --> 34:22.712
Blair, can I talk to you?

34:22.799 --> 34:24.105
It'll just take a moment.

34:24.192 --> 34:25.889
Sure. Sure.

34:33.332 --> 34:35.203
Serena's not a patient
at the Osteroff Center.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.597
Eric, you've always
been a sweet kid

34:37.684 --> 34:39.207
and I can understand you
trying to protect your sister--

34:39.294 --> 34:41.427
I am.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.993
I've never even seen you
take a drink.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.734
I'm not an alcoholic.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.607
I did this.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.655
And today Serena protected me.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.880
Eric, I...I didn't--

34:59.967 --> 35:02.143
See that coming?
Yeah.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.231
Well, it must be a shock
for someone

35:03.318 --> 35:04.754
who thinks
she knows everything.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.503
And what was that
all about?

35:14.590 --> 35:17.115
Another bomb lands
in Blair's lap.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.291
Will she use it as ammunition

35:19.378 --> 35:22.598
or will she finally surrender
and put down her arms?

35:22.685 --> 35:23.773
Nothing.

35:25.862 --> 35:28.169
[instrumental music]

35:31.651 --> 35:34.697
So you really impressed
the guy, huh?

35:34.784 --> 35:37.135
Must have been the way
you poured those sodas.

35:39.876 --> 35:43.053
Yeah, about that, uh..

35:43.141 --> 35:45.969
I know I may have been a little
light on the gratitude.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.754
Yeah, a touch.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.059
But I appreciate it.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.410
All of this..

35:51.497 --> 35:54.239
...even if I sometimes
don't show it.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.197
We're real men, son, we don't
like to share our feelings.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.811
But..

36:01.898 --> 36:05.119
...I know what you're
capable of and nothing..

36:05.206 --> 36:07.948
...my last name,
my bank account..

36:08.035 --> 36:09.732
...is gonna keep you
from getting what you deserve.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.649
Not if I can help it.

36:15.434 --> 36:16.478
'And I see that Dartmouth has'

36:16.565 --> 36:18.132
an electro acoustic
music program.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.438
What do you think
of me applying?

36:19.525 --> 36:21.048
What?

36:21.135 --> 36:22.919
Yeah, and Jenny's smart.
We'll get her early admission.

36:23.006 --> 36:25.748
Maybe we'll all go.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.402
So not remotely funny.

[cell phone ringing]

36:42.722 --> 36:43.897
Huh?

36:47.944 --> 36:49.119
Hello?

36:51.687 --> 36:54.647
Oh, yeah,
I'll be right there.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.171
Where the hell could you
possibly have to be right now?

36:57.258 --> 36:59.129
I'm late for
a run with my dad.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.046
Who's Jessica?

37:03.133 --> 37:06.136
Ah. Jersey girls.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.662
Let's just say they're in the
Princeton Tigers for a reason.

37:12.055 --> 37:13.361
Alright, I'll see ya.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.584
- 'You feel this? Feeling good?'
- 'Good.'

37:18.671 --> 37:20.803
Alright, 'cause I'm gonna..

37:20.890 --> 37:22.152
[Howie]
'Hey, good to see you, son.'

37:22.240 --> 37:23.893
Turns out Jed's
a runner, too.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.199
I would've never mentioned it
if I knew he was gonna

37:25.286 --> 37:26.940
get me out here this early.

37:27.027 --> 37:28.463
[Howie]
'I'm glad to see you're
feeling better, Nate.'

37:28.550 --> 37:30.073
I was just telling Jed
about your little bout

37:30.160 --> 37:32.337
of food poisoning last night.

37:32.424 --> 37:35.383
What do you say, kiddo?
Wanna show him how it's done?

37:35.470 --> 37:36.863
Let's go.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.995
Nate is the captain
of his lacrosse team..

37:39.082 --> 37:42.085
...as well as being an
All-Star cross country runner.

37:46.307 --> 37:49.223
[thunder rumbling]

37:53.140 --> 37:54.359
- Hi.
- Hey!

37:54.446 --> 37:57.405
Um, is it okay
that I'm here?

37:57.492 --> 37:59.277
Yeah. Hi.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.887
Uh, will your mom be mad?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.280
That you're here?

38:02.367 --> 38:04.412
That would require
her stopping by.

38:04.499 --> 38:07.023
Saturday mornings are spent
at bliss, and after last night

38:07.110 --> 38:09.939
I think she could use some
extra time on the massage table.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.507
Right, well, here.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.076
Somebody has an admirer.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.644
They're for my sister.
From the Brown rep.

38:18.731 --> 38:22.038
Um, apparently his cousin
did some time here in his youth.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.605
Well, that's good, right?

38:23.692 --> 38:25.868
I mean, at least her
entire future isn't blown.

38:25.955 --> 38:26.913
I don't think
that's making her feel

38:27.000 --> 38:28.480
a whole lot better
right now.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.411
[Blair]
'Whenever something's
bothering you'

38:46.498 --> 38:48.848
'I can always find you here.'

[clearing throat]

38:51.459 --> 38:53.461
You here for another catfight?

38:58.814 --> 39:00.207
What's that?

39:00.294 --> 39:02.078
A letter.

39:02.165 --> 39:05.125
I wrote it to you when you
were away at boarding school.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.648
'I never sent it.'

39:11.044 --> 39:14.352
"Dear Serena,
my world is falling apart.

who would understand.

to be my best friend.'

40:05.533 --> 40:07.840
Why didn't you send it?

40:07.927 --> 40:09.798
- I would've--
- You would've what?

40:12.714 --> 40:15.543
You knew, Serena..

40:15.630 --> 40:18.111
...and you didn't
even call.

40:18.198 --> 40:21.854
I didn't know
what to say to you

40:21.941 --> 40:24.596
or even how to be your friend
after what I did.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.036
I'm so sorry.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.782
Eric told me
what happened.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.742
I guess your family's been
going through a hard time too.

Spotted in Central Park,
two white flags waving.

40:47.270 --> 40:50.926
Could an Upper East Side
peace accord be far off?

40:51.013 --> 40:54.495
So what will it be,
truce or consequences?

We all know one nation
can't have two queens.
