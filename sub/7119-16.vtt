00:25.100 --> 00:26.200
Come back, thief!

00:27.701 --> 00:30.401
Stop farting on me! It's gross!

00:30.402 --> 00:32.402
You can't just go around stealing boots.

00:32.403 --> 00:35.303
Yeah, and you know the
penalty for stealing boots.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.804
It's poots... on newts.

00:41.105 --> 00:42.505
He's getting away in that lake!

00:42.506 --> 00:44.806
Dude, that isn't a lake.
That's an ocean.

00:58.707 --> 01:00.607
Poots on newts! Poots on newts!

01:06.408 --> 01:07.508
I'm coming, Jake.

01:07.509 --> 01:10.209
I'll poot on that newt
as soon as I'm barefoot.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.210
Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?

01:27.111 --> 01:28.611
Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?

01:28.612 --> 01:33.712
I am the manifestation of your fear...

01:33.713 --> 01:35.813
fear of the ocean!

01:35.814 --> 01:42.214
What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells,
or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles.

01:42.215 --> 01:43.715
Why would I be afraid of-

01:47.016 --> 01:49.516
Cause you're a wuss.

01:49.517 --> 01:52.617
I'm no wuss!
I'm the hero around these parts!

01:53.518 --> 01:57.618
You're too scared of the
ocean to ever be a true hero.

01:57.619 --> 02:00.619
Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!

02:06.820 --> 02:08.620
I shall conquer my fear.

02:08.621 --> 02:10.221
Yeah, right.

02:10.222 --> 02:11.222
No! I will.

02:11.323 --> 02:13.623
I'll conquer my fear.

02:13.624 --> 02:16.224
Of course you will.

02:16.825 --> 02:20.325
And I live in a two bedroom apartment
that doesn't smell like vomit.

02:20.326 --> 02:22.526
Ha ha, sarcasm.

02:23.527 --> 02:24.527
Dude!

02:25.128 --> 02:26.828
Dude, did you see me?

02:27.617 --> 02:30.829
I was all like womp, and then
I was all like take this!! Womp!

02:32.130 --> 02:34.630
And then...
Hey, whatâ€™s wrong with you, dude?

02:34.631 --> 02:37.431
Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.

02:37.432 --> 02:38.432
Say what, now?

02:38.433 --> 02:41.133
I need your help to overcome my fear.

02:41.134 --> 02:42.134
Will you do it?

02:43.535 --> 02:45.435
No... I don't really wanna do it.

02:45.436 --> 02:46.736
Jake! Come on!

02:46.737 --> 02:48.637
I'm just messing with you, I'll do it.

02:49.838 --> 02:50.938
Where to start?

02:52.139 --> 02:54.739
I think we should just take
a few steps in the water.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.140
You can hold Jaker's
hand if you're scared.

03:01.141 --> 03:02.441
Um... Oh it's ok, dude.

03:02.442 --> 03:04.842
I see the problem.
It's just your feet.

03:14.243 --> 03:16.943
<i>Don't be scared.
I shall not be scared.</i>

03:20.244 --> 03:21.944
I'm afraid!

03:21.945 --> 03:24.945
Jake, get me out of the water!
Now, Jake! Now! Now!

03:30.546 --> 03:32.646
Hot jam! You're really
scared of the ocean.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.747
In fact, you're so scared...
it gives me an idea.

03:36.148 --> 03:38.748
Let's start a business of
being scared of the ocean!

03:41.249 --> 03:42.949
I have a plan to get rid of your fear.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.350
We'll start tomorrow morning.

03:44.351 --> 03:46.251
But I must conquer this now!

03:47.552 --> 03:48.752
I'm not afraid of you!

03:58.253 --> 03:59.753
I'm afraid of you!
I'm afraid of you!

04:02.954 --> 04:05.454
Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.

04:05.755 --> 04:10.055
Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.

04:10.056 --> 04:10.956
Morning, Jake.

04:10.957 --> 04:13.157
Ready for me to help you
get over your ocean fear?

04:13.158 --> 04:14.158
Yeah, man.

04:14.159 --> 04:17.559
Cool... but I can only
do this if you ask me.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.360
I'm askin'!

04:18.361 --> 04:20.761
Then get ready for my three-step plan.

04:20.762 --> 04:24.262
Watch your troubles
melt away with step one!

04:29.063 --> 04:30.463
Jake, are you crazy?

04:30.464 --> 04:32.664
This is not an ok thing to do!

04:32.665 --> 04:34.465
Hey. Hey. Come on.

04:34.466 --> 04:38.166
The ocean is your friend, and you
got friends all around you right now.

04:38.167 --> 04:40.267
Miles and miles of friends.

04:40.968 --> 04:42.268
You're nuts.

04:44.069 --> 04:45.869
Don't try to struggle, man.

04:46.070 --> 04:47.870
I'll let you out in a second.

04:48.071 --> 04:50.071
You just need to calm down.

04:50.072 --> 04:53.372
Really? Ok. I'm calming down.

04:53.373 --> 04:55.673
That's great. You're doing great.

04:55.674 --> 04:57.174
Ready for step two?

04:57.175 --> 04:59.275
Yeah, man. I can do it.

04:59.276 --> 05:03.376
Alright, dude. Step... two!

05:04.777 --> 05:07.777
Jake, this isn't a joke!
It's touching me!

05:07.778 --> 05:10.379
Let it hold you, man!
Let it hold you like a child!

05:10.380 --> 05:11.880
I'm trying to let it hold me.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.381
Control your breathing!

05:19.582 --> 05:21.182
This isn't working!

05:21.183 --> 05:22.883
That means we gotta move to step three.

05:22.884 --> 05:24.484
Just don't scream.

05:24.485 --> 05:25.485
W-what?

05:25.486 --> 05:27.286
I'm gonna push you
underwater with my jowls.

05:27.287 --> 05:29.487
Just don't scream. Don't scream.

05:29.488 --> 05:30.989
- What?!
- Don't scream.

05:30.990 --> 05:34.090
Hold your breath, Finn.
You got it, dude!

05:35.591 --> 05:38.291
Get me away, Jake!
Now, Jake! Now! Right now!

05:38.292 --> 05:39.292
Get-Get me away!

05:39.593 --> 05:41.993
Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!

05:49.094 --> 05:51.694
I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?

05:51.695 --> 05:52.995
I think we should give up.

05:52.996 --> 05:55.696
What? I made it all the way to level three.

05:55.697 --> 05:58.797
Look, Finn. It's not that
I don't want to help you...

05:58.798 --> 06:01.098
I just don't wanna get beat up anymore.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.299
I mean this is my bread and butter.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.000
I can't have you messing up
my bread and butter, dude.

06:06.001 --> 06:08.501
You have to help me.
I can't do this without you.

06:08.502 --> 06:12.402
Ok. Fine... but only if you
swear not to hit me anymore.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.103
I swear I won't hit you anymore.

06:14.104 --> 06:16.304
And also swear to only speak in rhymes.

06:16.305 --> 06:18.405
Speak in rhymes all the times.

06:19.006 --> 06:21.606
I swear... and pigs have hair.

06:21.607 --> 06:22.907
Yes. Perfect.

06:22.908 --> 06:26.608
And since you want more...
it's time for step four.

06:26.609 --> 06:29.909
What? I thought you said it
was a three step plan... man.

06:29.910 --> 06:31.510
I'm not that good at counting.

06:32.511 --> 06:33.511
Come on.

06:33.612 --> 06:36.712
Let's go kick your fear of the
ocean where the sun don't shine...

06:36.713 --> 06:38.513
in the sea cucumber.

06:45.414 --> 06:49.114
Check it, dude. One hundred
percent awesome-itude.

06:49.715 --> 06:52.815
Yeah. It's pretty math...
you psychopath.

06:52.816 --> 06:55.816
You know, it looks way more
math if you open up your eyes.

07:00.117 --> 07:02.017
See, man? The ocean is beautiful.

07:02.018 --> 07:04.418
There's no reason to be afraid
of things that are beautiful.

07:05.219 --> 07:07.519
This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.020
Hey, look! A black abyss!

07:09.021 --> 07:11.421
Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.

07:14.522 --> 07:16.522
No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!

07:20.123 --> 07:23.023
Saying, 'Turn around' twice
doesn't count as a rhyme, dude!

07:23.724 --> 07:24.824
Hey, you swore!

07:24.825 --> 07:26.125
Ow! My bread and butter!

07:26.426 --> 07:28.126
No, dude! Don't!

07:35.127 --> 07:37.127
Don't worry, dude.
Everything's cool.

07:37.128 --> 07:39.728
This is the perfect segue into level five.

07:39.729 --> 07:41.029
Here, put this on.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.130
Just make sure you don't
pull the emergency tab.

07:45.931 --> 07:47.131
No, dude! I said don't...

08:02.132 --> 08:03.832
Pathetic!

08:03.833 --> 08:08.333
You can't even overcome your fear
now that your friend is about to die!

08:08.634 --> 08:13.534
Your un-heroic body will
never let you save Jake.

08:15.335 --> 08:16.235
You're right.

08:16.236 --> 08:19.036
What? Really?
You think I'm right?

08:19.037 --> 08:21.137
Well, that's... that's great!

08:21.438 --> 08:23.838
If my body won't let me
rescue my best friend,

08:23.839 --> 08:25.939
then there's only one thing left to do.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.940
No. Wait. No! Noooo!

08:52.941 --> 08:54.941
Jake! Jake! Wake up!

08:55.742 --> 08:56.642
You ok, dude?

08:56.643 --> 08:58.143
Yeah, man. Wait...

08:58.644 --> 09:01.744
Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!

09:01.745 --> 09:02.245
What?

09:02.246 --> 09:04.146
You're at the bottom of the ocean!

09:07.647 --> 09:09.647
Maybe we should celebrate on land.

09:19.048 --> 09:21.248
I'm proud of you man. You did it!

09:21.249 --> 09:22.249
Thanks, dude.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.350
You have nothing to be proud of, boy!

09:25.651 --> 09:28.251
You will never get of your fear of the ocean!

09:28.252 --> 09:31.952
Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?

09:31.953 --> 09:34.553
What the flip, man?
I just swam to the bottom!

09:34.554 --> 09:36.354
No you didn't, cheater!

09:36.355 --> 09:41.355
You just sank to the bottom.
You will never be a great hero.

09:41.356 --> 09:43.656
He's right. I'll never be a hero.

09:48.258 --> 09:50.758
Finn, you are wrong.

09:50.759 --> 09:54.159
The mark of a great hero is his flaw.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.160
You know nothing, Wise Men!

09:57.161 --> 10:01.161
Silence, Fear Feaster!
We know a lot!

10:01.162 --> 10:03.462
Wait... Why did you
wait so long to tell me?

10:03.463 --> 10:07.163
Because the limo driver's
flaw is being late!

10:07.164 --> 10:08.464
Sorry.

10:12.565 --> 10:18.465
Farewell, Finn. You truly
are the greatest hero of Ooo.

10:20.366 --> 10:22.766
It's time for you to
go away, Fear Feaster!

10:22.767 --> 10:26.567
What? Am I supposed to live in
your tummy for the rest of my life?

10:26.568 --> 10:27.668
Everybody has a flaw...

10:27.669 --> 10:30.669
and it looks like yours is
smelling like my nasty guts.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.870
Wonderful...
