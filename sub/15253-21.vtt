00:00.436 --> 00:01.279
<i>Hi I'm Chuck.</i>

00:01.280 --> 00:02.024
<i>Here are a few things,</i>

00:02.049 --> 00:02.908
<i>that you might need to know:</i>

00:02.909 --> 00:04.009
I had a fiancée.

00:04.075 --> 00:05.377
<i>Now she thinks I'm dead.</i>

00:05.444 --> 00:07.012
I don't want you lying
to your mother on my behalf.

00:07.079 --> 00:08.346
Me neither, but lying

00:08.414 --> 00:10.649
<i>to her kind of goes</i>
<i>with our territory.</i>

00:10.716 --> 00:13.852
Chuck, I'd like you to meet
my dad, Jack Burton.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.654
I'm not interested in
your stolen money.

00:15.721 --> 00:18.290
Stolen? That's what you think of
your old man... some two-bit thief?

00:18.357 --> 00:21.359
<i>Darlin', a thief has to run</i>
<i>out of town as fast as he can,</i>

00:21.427 --> 00:22.711
but a good con man...

00:22.795 --> 00:24.362
A good con man can leave
whenever he wants.

00:24.413 --> 00:25.664
I remember, Dad.

00:27.867 --> 00:29.384
(doorbell ringing)

00:31.671 --> 00:32.837
Hello, miss.

00:32.888 --> 00:34.205
Hi. It's that time
of the year again.

00:34.257 --> 00:35.540
Cookies.

00:35.591 --> 00:36.841
Oh. And we're having a special.

00:36.909 --> 00:39.644
If you get a box of each flavor
right now,

00:39.712 --> 00:41.680
You get 20% off
your whole order.

00:41.747 --> 00:44.215
Well, okay. Great.
So I'll put you down

00:44.267 --> 00:48.019
for the Skinny Mints,
Palominos and Butter cookies.

00:48.070 --> 00:52.724
Plus the Plippers, Zigaroos
and Sugar-go-rounds... Oh...

00:52.792 --> 00:54.726
You will not be sorry
about those,

00:54.777 --> 00:57.529
I don't... Our entire new line
of nougat-filled bon-bons,

00:57.597 --> 00:59.331
and of course,
the five original wafers.

00:59.398 --> 01:01.666
With a 20% discount, you're
looking at a grand total

01:01.734 --> 01:03.635
of $84.

01:07.239 --> 01:09.674
But that's exactly what I have.

01:09.742 --> 01:12.711
Thanks, miss.

01:12.778 --> 01:15.547
Your cookies should
arrive next month.

Oh, not bad at all.

We made over two grand today.

You're getting better at this.

01:42.341 --> 01:44.959

you know all the cons...

01:45.044 --> 01:46.828
I'll never be a sucker.

01:47.947 --> 01:49.247
That's right.

01:49.315 --> 01:51.449
There's your cut.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.419
You earned it.

01:54.470 --> 01:55.970
What you going
to do with all that?

01:56.055 --> 01:57.839
I don't know.

01:57.923 --> 02:01.059
If you could have anything in the
whole world what would it be?

02:03.729 --> 02:04.896
An adventure somewhere.

02:04.963 --> 02:06.998
Just you and me.

02:07.066 --> 02:10.368
I tell you what, you save up
and maybe we can do just that.

02:18.244 --> 02:20.812
Home, sweet home.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.347
Can I come in?

02:22.415 --> 02:24.165
I probably shouldn't, kiddo.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.251
Your grandma's not too
happy with me right now.

02:31.257 --> 02:32.957
See ya later, alligator.

02:33.025 --> 02:34.709
In a while, crocodile.

02:40.232 --> 02:42.000
WOMAN:
And... your father?

02:43.936 --> 02:46.504
Your father, Miss Walker?

02:46.555 --> 02:48.173
Should I include him
on the invite list?

02:48.240 --> 02:49.674
Oh, uh, no.

02:49.742 --> 02:53.344
No, that won't be necessary.

02:53.412 --> 02:55.213
My father doesn't know
we're getting married.

02:55.281 --> 02:56.681
Sarah and her dad have
a very complicated...

02:56.732 --> 02:58.850
The invite list looks great
as it stands. Thank you.

02:58.901 --> 03:00.402
Well, all right then.

03:00.486 --> 03:01.703
It looks like
everything is in place.

03:01.787 --> 03:03.354
We've got the location,

03:03.422 --> 03:04.355
the flowers,

03:04.423 --> 03:06.324
the food.

03:06.375 --> 03:10.361
So, are you two finally ready
to pull the trigger on this?

03:12.698 --> 03:14.999
Trust me, I now that
making decisions like this

03:15.067 --> 03:16.334
can be...

03:16.385 --> 03:17.535
Overwhelming.

03:17.586 --> 03:19.387
And exhausting.
Exactly.

03:19.472 --> 03:21.539
So if you two need
a little more time

03:21.590 --> 03:24.041
to think things over, we don't
have to move forward just yet.

03:26.929 --> 03:28.680
No, we're ready.

03:28.731 --> 03:30.615
No more changes.

03:41.393 --> 03:42.727
Here's the wedding plan.

03:42.778 --> 03:44.245
Pretty cool, huh?

03:44.330 --> 03:45.747
This one's for you.

03:45.831 --> 03:47.398
I made copies for everybody.
And they're laminated.

03:47.450 --> 03:49.701
Perfect. It saves me
the trouble of doing it.

03:49.769 --> 03:51.035
Well...

03:51.086 --> 03:52.203
Um, can I ask you something?

03:52.271 --> 03:54.906
You went with Helvetica
for the invitations...

03:54.974 --> 03:56.941
and your wedding colors
are red and black?

03:57.009 --> 03:58.109
Yeah?

03:58.177 --> 03:59.511
Ooh, it's just together

03:59.578 --> 04:00.912
they scream Socialism,
you know?

04:00.980 --> 04:02.280
Casey's going to decline.

04:02.348 --> 04:04.466
Well, Sarah and I thought
they were pretty nice.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.217
I bet.
So did Chairman Mao.

04:06.285 --> 04:08.920
I guess I could talk
to Sarah about it.

04:08.988 --> 04:10.789
I would.
Anyway, listen,

04:10.856 --> 04:12.791
I have a big day planned
at the Buy More for Casey,

04:12.858 --> 04:13.942
so I'm going
to get out of here.

04:14.026 --> 04:15.426
Good luck.

04:15.478 --> 04:16.528
Hey.

04:16.595 --> 04:18.062
You have a lot to talk about.

04:18.113 --> 04:19.613
Have fun.

04:19.697 --> 04:23.768
Hey. Silly, quick
little question.

04:23.836 --> 04:26.437
Do our wedding colors
remind you of Socialism?

04:26.505 --> 04:27.572
In a good way?

04:27.623 --> 04:29.073
Is there a good way?

04:29.141 --> 04:30.341
You know, I don't want
to make a thing out of it,

04:30.409 --> 04:32.143
so let's just call Daphne
and see what she thinks.

04:32.211 --> 04:33.711
Yeah, get her on speaker phone.

04:33.779 --> 04:34.746
Love that gal.

04:36.799 --> 04:41.352
We're sorry, the number you have
reached is not in service.

04:41.420 --> 04:44.288
Please check the number
or try your call again.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.474
Are you sure you dialed
the right number?

04:46.559 --> 04:49.794
SARAH: Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
We've been conned.

04:49.862 --> 04:51.196
We've been conned.

04:51.263 --> 04:52.964
She's already cashed our check

04:53.015 --> 04:54.732
and our account
has been emptied out.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.135
I just don't understand.

04:58.187 --> 04:59.854
She came so highly recommended.

04:59.939 --> 05:00.989
By the Internet.

05:01.073 --> 05:02.674
I should have seen this coming.

05:02.741 --> 05:04.859
She asked
for our money up-front,

05:04.944 --> 05:06.277
'cause she gave us
a 40% discount.

05:06.328 --> 05:08.663
You know, if there is one thing

05:08.747 --> 05:11.082
I am not, Chuck...
it's a sucker.

05:11.149 --> 05:12.483
Yeah, well, me neither.

05:12.535 --> 05:14.335
I mean, we're not a couple
of sappy, helpless love birds.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.588
Yeah, that's right.
We're CIA agents.

05:16.655 --> 05:20.341
Daphne Peralta... she chose
the wrong couple to con.

05:20.426 --> 05:23.528
That's us, right, honey?
Of course I mean us.

05:23.596 --> 05:25.213
Just checking. I thought maybe
there was another couple

05:25.297 --> 05:26.497
that you...

06:10.061 --> 06:12.061
You know, for an amateur con,

06:12.142 --> 06:14.027
Daphne Peralta sure is
hard to find.

06:14.094 --> 06:16.562
I don't get it.
We've traced every cell phone,

06:16.630 --> 06:19.098
every bank account, and nothing.

06:19.149 --> 06:20.767
She must have hundreds
of aliases.

06:20.818 --> 06:21.951
She's a ghost.

06:22.062 --> 06:23.429
I mean, not literally.

06:23.497 --> 06:25.331
You know, it's not an apparition
we're dealing with.

06:25.399 --> 06:27.149
But in the sense that
she's really hard to find.

06:27.234 --> 06:30.236
I've used every available
resource to find her.

06:30.304 --> 06:31.804
Well, we could ask
General Beckman for help.

06:31.855 --> 06:33.139
To locate our wedding planner?

06:33.207 --> 06:34.607
I don't think that's going
to go down too well.

06:34.658 --> 06:36.509
Honey, I know she
stole from us,

06:36.577 --> 06:38.778
but you're taking
this really hard.

06:38.829 --> 06:39.946
Well, of course I am.

06:39.997 --> 06:41.581
I was raised by a con man
and I got taken.

06:41.648 --> 06:43.549
We've done everything
to make it right.

06:43.617 --> 06:46.085
We've left no stone unturned.

06:48.222 --> 06:50.289
Not every stone.

06:53.877 --> 06:55.011
And right here, gentlemen,

06:55.095 --> 06:56.462
where you see your new
shopping center...

06:56.530 --> 07:00.266
the Nagamichi Complex 2011.

07:00.334 --> 07:03.336
I got chills
just thinking about it.

07:03.403 --> 07:05.071
Do we have a deal?

07:06.607 --> 07:08.307
SARAH:
Jack Burton?

07:13.780 --> 07:15.031
Uh, give me one
minute, gentlemen.

07:15.115 --> 07:17.199
Old business associate of mine.

07:17.284 --> 07:19.819
Oh-ho... my daughter conned?

07:19.870 --> 07:21.787
I know. Chuck and I

07:21.855 --> 07:23.623
were throwing this party and...

07:23.690 --> 07:26.692
Wow, you're still in Burbank
with the Schnook?

07:26.760 --> 07:28.127
How's that?
Fine.

07:28.194 --> 07:30.830
Anyway, the party
planner, she ran off

07:30.897 --> 07:32.214
with all of our money.

07:32.299 --> 07:33.432
Do you know Daphne Peralta?

07:33.500 --> 07:34.800
Have you ever worked with her?

07:34.868 --> 07:37.670
No, I'm sorry, darling,
I never heard that name before.

07:39.573 --> 07:46.245
Why don't you use some of your
vast CIA resources to find her?

07:46.313 --> 07:48.281
How did you find out?

07:49.549 --> 07:52.485
Took a peek at your wallet.

07:52.552 --> 07:54.320
Fancy Federal I.D. there.

07:54.388 --> 07:55.905
Got to say
I'm a little surprised

07:55.989 --> 07:59.058
you turned out to be such
an upstanding citizen.

07:59.126 --> 08:01.227
And a little proud, too.

08:03.914 --> 08:06.332
Well, I've used all of my
available resources

08:06.400 --> 08:08.417
and I don't have the authority
to go any further.

08:08.502 --> 08:10.569
Why let that stop you?

08:10.620 --> 08:12.505
Con means confidence,
you know that.

08:12.572 --> 08:14.874
You remember that summer
that we spent in Savannah?

08:14.941 --> 08:18.878
The month where we lived
in the governor's mansion.

08:18.929 --> 08:22.448
You don't have the authority,
you pretend you do.

08:22.516 --> 08:25.418
That's right... fake it
till you make it.

08:25.485 --> 08:28.421
Okay, thanks for
your help, Dad.

08:28.488 --> 08:29.722
So that's it?

08:29.773 --> 08:32.558
You're not going
to explain to me what happened

08:32.626 --> 08:36.145
in the last two years to
make you go from con to mark?

08:37.364 --> 08:39.030
In a while, crocodile.

08:43.035 --> 08:45.004
Hey, Dad.

08:45.072 --> 08:46.672
Funny meeting you here.

08:46.740 --> 08:47.823
Hello.

08:47.908 --> 08:49.442
Why do I feel like
this is an ambush?

08:49.509 --> 08:50.910
'Cause today is the day,
John Casey.

08:50.977 --> 08:52.011
What, that you move out?

08:52.079 --> 08:53.913
No... who's gonna
to do your laundry?

08:53.980 --> 08:56.749
Today is the day you
speak to Kathleen.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.117
And tell her that
you're still alive.

08:58.168 --> 08:59.418
Yay.
Yay.

08:59.469 --> 09:00.669
Not gonna happen.

09:00.754 --> 09:04.090
Okay, Dad, you have been
putting this off for a week.

09:04.141 --> 09:05.224
I know it's going to
be hard to tell her,

09:05.291 --> 09:06.458
but you have to.

09:06.510 --> 09:08.177
You said we were going
to do this together.

09:08.261 --> 09:10.295
I'm not avoiding anything.

09:10.347 --> 09:11.981
Your mother believes
that I'm dead.

09:12.065 --> 09:13.265
If she walks into the Buy More,

09:13.333 --> 09:15.668
she'll think I left her
for some crappy job.

09:15.736 --> 09:17.636
She deserves better than that.

09:20.157 --> 09:21.857
So much for that great idea.

09:21.942 --> 09:24.026
Yeah, it wasn't such
a great plan after all, was it?

09:27.080 --> 09:30.983
Okay, be cool. Be cool.

09:31.034 --> 09:33.702
Hey, did you guys find that new
iPad case you were looking for?

09:33.787 --> 09:36.038
No, no, we're actually
completely sold out of them.

09:36.123 --> 09:37.990
And I am very
disappointed about it.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.208
So we're just going to go.

09:39.292 --> 09:40.843
What?
They don't have it.

09:40.927 --> 09:43.362
Honey, there's all those cute...
No, that's the wrong generation.

09:43.430 --> 09:45.848
They're a little bit
different... the size...

09:47.200 --> 09:48.684
You want me to what?!

09:48.752 --> 09:50.853
Just fake a flash.
A little one.

09:50.921 --> 09:52.154
On Daphne Peralta?

09:52.222 --> 09:53.806
Look, I question your
dad's influence on you,

09:53.857 --> 09:55.441
because that is just crazy.

09:55.509 --> 09:57.843
No, look, we've gone as far as we
can without Beckman's approval.

09:57.894 --> 10:00.279
And all we need to do is access
the FBI's Echelon satellites.

10:00.347 --> 10:03.699
Now she can either help us,
or we lose Daphne,

10:03.784 --> 10:05.751
and our wedding.
Okay, okay, fine.

10:05.819 --> 10:07.453
I'll just give her one of these.

10:10.924 --> 10:12.691
And voila...
access granted.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.327
It doesn't look like that.

10:16.413 --> 10:19.215
Oh? What does it
look like exactly?

10:19.299 --> 10:20.532
Well, it kind of looks like

10:20.584 --> 10:22.835
you saw something really bright

10:22.903 --> 10:25.371
and tasted something really
sour at the same time.

10:25.439 --> 10:28.174
I don't know... if I had to do
it, it would kind of be like...

10:32.846 --> 10:34.480
Like that.

10:36.716 --> 10:38.350
Oh.

10:39.402 --> 10:40.486
What?

10:40.553 --> 10:41.737
I thought it was good.

10:41.822 --> 10:43.722
Hey, you don't like my flash?

10:43.773 --> 10:44.824
It's not that I don't
like your flash...

10:44.891 --> 10:46.025
Well, then tell me.

11:02.442 --> 11:03.909
She lives with the Schnook.

11:06.079 --> 11:08.681
Yo, bro.

11:08.748 --> 11:10.549
You're in Neighborhood Watch
territory now.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.750
Go ahead.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.285
Try and run.
I will be faster

11:13.353 --> 11:14.353
'cause I have superior form.

11:14.421 --> 11:16.355
(laughs)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:16.422 --> 11:17.723
My daughter lives here...

11:18.758 --> 11:19.725
Sarah Walker.

11:19.776 --> 11:20.893
I'm Jack.

11:20.944 --> 11:23.946
Wow, that's a hell
of a grip you got there.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.030
Do you rock climb?

11:25.098 --> 11:26.866
Just a couple times a week.

11:26.933 --> 11:29.301
I actually
did El Capitan in '79.

11:29.369 --> 11:33.105
Whoa, dude, that's awesome.
Yeah.

11:33.173 --> 11:34.340
I'm Devon.
I'm Chuck's brother-in-law.

11:34.407 --> 11:36.609
Oh, right, right.
Yeah. Yeah, man.

11:36.676 --> 11:37.943
Sorry about all

11:37.994 --> 11:39.378
the Neighborhood Watch talk.

11:39.445 --> 11:40.663
Just protecting the fam,
you know?

11:40.747 --> 11:43.115
Of course, what's more important
than family, hmm?

11:43.166 --> 11:46.418
Well, I was, uh, I was
gonna surprise Sarah,

11:46.486 --> 11:47.987
but obviously she's not home.

11:48.054 --> 11:52.091
The problem is, (chuckles)
I got nowhere else to go.

11:52.158 --> 11:56.762
Oh, well, I, uh,
I'm on baby duty, so...

11:56.830 --> 11:57.813
Of course.

11:57.898 --> 12:01.100
Sure, I'd be happy to help out.

12:01.151 --> 12:03.135
Is that your place right there?

12:05.639 --> 12:08.340
SARAH: General, I've been
following somebody;

12:08.408 --> 12:11.243
a woman I think may be more
dangerous than we expect.

12:12.412 --> 12:13.612
Who is she?

12:13.663 --> 12:15.915
Daphne Peralta.

12:19.419 --> 12:22.154
Chuck, did you just flash?

12:22.205 --> 12:25.758
That I did, partner.
And you are right,

12:25.825 --> 12:29.011
this Daphne Peralta is
a very dangerous woman.

12:29.095 --> 12:30.930
What did you see?

12:30.997 --> 12:32.898
Connections.

12:32.966 --> 12:34.967
Specifically, connections
between her

12:35.018 --> 12:36.936
and other dangerous people.

12:37.003 --> 12:38.270
Who specifically?

12:38.338 --> 12:40.773
Anan Magoro.

12:40.840 --> 12:44.310
But we just took down the entire
Magoro terrorist cell.

12:44.377 --> 12:45.978
Was there anyone else?

12:46.029 --> 12:48.681
Yeah. Yeah.

12:48.748 --> 12:49.582
Who was that?

12:52.552 --> 12:54.620
Artur Novokov.

12:54.688 --> 12:55.988
Artur Novokov?

12:56.056 --> 12:59.792
He blew up three U.S. embassies
in Africa last week.

12:59.859 --> 13:01.393
I'm putting out an
interdepartmental call

13:01.461 --> 13:02.728
to CIA, NSA and FBI.

13:02.796 --> 13:04.079
This could be
the most important piece

13:04.164 --> 13:06.065
of U.S. Intelligence work
in the last three months.

13:06.132 --> 13:10.469
Uh, General, before you do that,
you should actually know that...

13:10.537 --> 13:12.538
I want every resource we have
Gentlemen, as of this moment,

13:12.606 --> 13:14.506
redirected towards
one singular goal:

13:14.574 --> 13:19.511
the location and apprehension of
this woman, Daphne Peralta.

13:19.579 --> 13:22.181
(computers chirping)

13:27.103 --> 13:29.054
I want her captured
dead or alive.

13:35.573 --> 13:37.300
What?
How am I suppose

13:37.301 --> 13:39.236
to know who Artur Novokov is?

13:39.291 --> 13:40.575
Because you work for the CIA.

13:40.660 --> 13:41.860
It's not my fault, okay?

13:41.911 --> 13:43.561
We've been planning a wedding.

13:43.612 --> 13:46.164
I've been incredibly busy.
And besides, who puts

13:46.232 --> 13:48.133
a story this important
on page 13?!

13:48.200 --> 13:51.036
Oh, one of the Kardashian
girls just got her GED.

13:51.103 --> 13:52.504
Allegedly.

13:52.571 --> 13:55.573
Chuck, all branches of the U.S.
military are about to launch

13:55.641 --> 13:56.941
a full-scale attack
on our wedding planner.

13:57.009 --> 13:58.743
And it's not gonna take them
that long

13:58.794 --> 13:59.928
to figure out the connection!

14:00.012 --> 14:03.048
But the good news is...
now we have access

14:03.115 --> 14:05.433
to all of
the agencies' databases.

14:05.518 --> 14:08.219
Daphne Peralta...
(cracks knuckles)

14:08.287 --> 14:10.105
we're coming for you.

14:10.189 --> 14:12.057
Keep your eye on it, kid.

14:12.108 --> 14:14.693
Ready?

14:14.760 --> 14:17.562
(baby cooing)

14:17.630 --> 14:18.963
What do you think?

14:19.031 --> 14:20.865
So, you here for the big day?

14:20.933 --> 14:21.866
What big day?

14:21.934 --> 14:24.002
Uh...

14:27.439 --> 14:29.958
Today.

14:30.042 --> 14:31.743
Every day's a big day to me.

14:31.794 --> 14:33.495
I'm a go-getter. Carpe diem.

14:34.814 --> 14:36.881
Hey, I got your toy.

14:36.949 --> 14:38.917
Yeah, your favorite toy.

14:38.984 --> 14:40.085
You're good with her.

14:40.152 --> 14:43.555
Yeah, you know,
at first it was tough.

14:43.622 --> 14:44.622
I mean,

14:44.690 --> 14:46.291
really tough.

14:46.358 --> 14:48.626
But then I started
to learn Clara's signals.

14:48.694 --> 14:49.828
Signals?

14:49.895 --> 14:51.346
Yeah, like when she wants
her pacifier,

14:51.430 --> 14:52.831
she puts her hands to her face,

14:52.898 --> 14:55.400
Like a "tell" in poker, right?

14:55.467 --> 14:57.168
Sure.

14:57.236 --> 14:58.486
My daughter, whoo,

14:58.571 --> 14:59.904
she's a tough one to read.

14:59.972 --> 15:01.973
I taught her
to keep things close.

15:02.024 --> 15:03.575
I said, the second you let

15:03.642 --> 15:06.161
your guard down, you get hurt.

15:06.245 --> 15:07.829
And she did, she let
her guard down.

15:07.913 --> 15:09.948
(quietly):
And I want to know why.

15:14.319 --> 15:17.956
You don't mind if I stick around
a bit, do you?

15:18.007 --> 15:19.090
You get HBO, right?

15:20.559 --> 15:21.793
(alert tone sounds)

15:21.861 --> 15:24.462
(Chuck typing)

15:24.530 --> 15:26.598
Sarah, would it surprise
you to hear that

15:26.665 --> 15:28.299
your father is at Ellie
and Devon's apartment?

15:28.367 --> 15:30.168
What?

15:34.774 --> 15:35.774
Of course.

15:35.841 --> 15:37.275
Baby, at this point,
maybe we should

15:37.342 --> 15:38.893
just tell him about
the wedding, you know?

15:38.978 --> 15:39.978
It'll make everything easier

15:40.029 --> 15:41.679
and I'm sure he'd love
to be there.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.248
Chuck, my dad hasn't been there

15:43.315 --> 15:45.250
for a single important day in
my life.

15:45.317 --> 15:46.618
So let's just focus on Daphne.

15:46.685 --> 15:48.820
I think I found her on one

15:48.888 --> 15:50.522
of these FBI
Echelon satellites.

15:50.589 --> 15:55.460
This was taken
five minutes ago.

15:56.796 --> 15:59.230
So, what is a Super Shuttle?

15:59.298 --> 16:01.966
Reliable transport
at a reasonable price.

16:02.034 --> 16:05.170
Leaving Pasadena on the 134.

16:05.237 --> 16:06.304
I got an idea.

16:06.372 --> 16:08.339
Super Shuttle? Hi.

16:08.390 --> 16:10.074
Yes, I'd like
to organize a pickup.

16:10.142 --> 16:11.810
Yes, I do have a Triple A card.

16:19.685 --> 16:21.903
SARAH: Okay, Chuck,
I managed to shut off

16:21.987 --> 16:23.521
Castle's satellite feed.

16:23.572 --> 16:25.607
You have five minutes to get
Daphne off that shuttle.

16:25.691 --> 16:28.726
Beckman's already got Casey
in the field with a SWAT team.

16:31.697 --> 16:33.865
General, do we have a location
on the target?

16:33.916 --> 16:35.066
Not yet, Colonel.

16:35.134 --> 16:37.235
Our satellites are still dark,
but we're

16:37.286 --> 16:38.736
working on getting them
back up now.

16:38.804 --> 16:40.205
I'll be ready.

16:42.258 --> 16:44.576
GIRL: Oh, my God, Rosa,
I met this super-hot guy

16:44.643 --> 16:46.611
at the Winston this week.

16:46.679 --> 16:50.431
Daphne Peralta?

16:51.684 --> 16:54.802
(clears throat)

16:54.887 --> 16:55.937
Surprise!

16:56.021 --> 16:57.305
Chuck Bartowski.

16:57.389 --> 17:00.424
I work for the United States
government. And you, ma'am...

17:00.476 --> 17:03.945
(handcuffs click)
are under arrest.

17:04.029 --> 17:05.230
Sarah, I've got her.

17:05.281 --> 17:07.397
We'll get her off the van
at the next stop.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.451
Watch this.

17:12.070 --> 17:13.454
What are you doing?!

17:13.539 --> 17:15.406
Get away from me!
Oh, my God, somebody

17:15.457 --> 17:16.324
please do something!

17:16.407 --> 17:17.876
What's going on back there?!

17:17.943 --> 17:19.277
Nothing, nothing.

17:19.328 --> 17:21.663
Everything is under control!
I work for the U.S. government.

17:21.747 --> 17:22.664
He does not!

17:22.748 --> 17:24.281
This weirdo is
my ex-boyfriend!

17:24.349 --> 17:26.084
He's been stalking me for months!
There's a stalker?

17:26.135 --> 17:29.187
Oh, my God, he just exposed himself!
Ew. No, I didn't.

17:29.255 --> 17:30.755
Oh, my God, this guy just

17:30.806 --> 17:33.725
totally exposed himself to this
woman on the Super Shuttle.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.026
Somebody, please do something!

17:35.094 --> 17:37.679
I didn't expose myself!
Okay, everyone just calm down.

17:37.763 --> 17:39.297
What is going on in there?

17:39.348 --> 17:40.298
Nothing, nothing!

17:40.349 --> 17:41.649
Everything's under control.

17:41.734 --> 17:43.134
I'm fine. How are you?

17:43.202 --> 17:45.353
I told you we should
have taken a taxi.

17:45.437 --> 17:46.971
What's it, $15 more?

17:47.039 --> 17:48.973
Quiet down, all of you, okay?!

17:49.024 --> 17:51.776
We're already late!

17:51.827 --> 17:53.311
Now who's flying Southwest?

17:55.030 --> 17:56.314
You? Okay.

17:56.365 --> 17:59.117
Colonel, I was able to get
a trace on our target.

17:59.184 --> 18:00.818
Sending it to you now.

18:00.869 --> 18:03.004
Hmm. Super Shuttle.

18:03.088 --> 18:05.924
Good cover. No one would
give it a second look.

18:05.991 --> 18:07.191
Listen up, men!

18:07.259 --> 18:09.027
Daphne Peralta is smart
and dangerous.

18:09.094 --> 18:10.995
I don't want
to lose anyone today,

18:11.063 --> 18:13.464
so keep your eyes peeled
and your guns ready.

18:13.532 --> 18:14.999
You heard her, boys.
We're going in hot.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.351
AGENTS:
Hoo-ah!

18:16.435 --> 18:17.552
Listen, you have got

18:17.636 --> 18:19.437
to get Daphne off that shuttle
right now!

18:19.504 --> 18:20.805
Okay, okay, I'm working on it.

18:20.873 --> 18:23.241
Yeah, that's right.
I'm talking through a earpiece

18:23.309 --> 18:25.860
to a government agent who also wears an
earpiece 'cause we're government agents!

18:25.945 --> 18:27.111
No more messing around.

18:27.179 --> 18:29.013
Sir, stop this shuttle
right now!

18:29.064 --> 18:31.182
No way, man. I'll lose my job
if I don't get everybody

18:31.250 --> 18:32.233
to the airport on time.

18:32.318 --> 18:34.519
I am extremely unstable!
(woman shrieks)

18:34.586 --> 18:35.720
DRIVER:
What're you talking about?

18:35.788 --> 18:36.921
If you don't pull over

18:36.989 --> 18:40.041
this van, I will
expose myself to you

18:40.125 --> 18:42.026
and everyone else in
this vehicle.

18:42.094 --> 18:42.860
(gasps)

18:42.911 --> 18:44.329
Oh, my God.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.297
(engine revs, tires squeal)

18:47.800 --> 18:50.234
(car tires screech)
Blondie's here, too, huh?

18:50.302 --> 18:52.553
Okay, look, this is already
spiraling out of control.

18:52.638 --> 18:54.205
The CIA's gonna be here
any minute,

18:54.256 --> 18:55.723
so please, just get in the car.

18:55.808 --> 18:59.677
Listen, I get it that you're
angry, okay? But there's

18:59.728 --> 19:01.179
not a damn thing you can do.

19:01.230 --> 19:03.247
Your little government con?
It failed.

19:03.315 --> 19:05.316
I'm calling your bluff.

19:06.902 --> 19:08.052
What the...?

19:10.072 --> 19:13.191
(guns cocking)

19:13.258 --> 19:15.126
We are in really big trouble.

19:15.194 --> 19:16.160
Yeah.

19:20.799 --> 19:21.966
She's your wedding planner?

19:22.034 --> 19:25.203
Do you two have any idea
what you have done?!

19:25.270 --> 19:26.337
An inkling, yeah.

19:26.405 --> 19:28.456
I'm to blame, General.
It was my idea.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.208
We all have
personal lives, Walker.

19:30.275 --> 19:32.477
It shouldn't interfere
with the mission. You know that.

19:32.544 --> 19:35.046
You're both to blame.
I just thank God

19:35.114 --> 19:36.981
that Ms. Peralta isn't going
to press charges.

19:37.049 --> 19:39.550
Press charges?!
She's a thief, General!

19:39.601 --> 19:42.270
She stole $26,230 from us.

19:42.354 --> 19:44.956
For the foreseeable future,
you're both suspended.

19:45.024 --> 19:47.725
General, General, this is
Daphne's client book, okay?

19:47.776 --> 19:50.061
It has all the people
she's conned in it. Look,

19:50.129 --> 19:51.763
the Bartholomews,
they were promised

19:51.830 --> 19:53.481
a horse-drawn carriage
for their wedding!

19:53.565 --> 19:55.950
Over here, oh, look
at that, the Gerlichs!

19:56.035 --> 19:57.402
Look at all the
family they have

19:57.453 --> 19:59.170
flying in from Hungary.

19:59.238 --> 20:01.289
I mean, the airfare alone...

20:05.844 --> 20:07.078
Oh, General,

20:07.146 --> 20:09.514
the bride's brothers are
Hungarian scientists.

20:09.581 --> 20:11.482
Let me guess: you flashed.

20:11.550 --> 20:13.818
Yeah! Yes, I did.

20:13.886 --> 20:15.586
I did, I did, yes.

20:15.654 --> 20:16.921
Bruno, Franz and Paulie Klug,

20:16.972 --> 20:18.656
they've been working
for the Iranian government

20:18.724 --> 20:19.657
for the last decade.

20:19.725 --> 20:21.325
They have all of Iran's nuclear

20:21.393 --> 20:24.628
research on a portable device
called the "Zephyr."

20:24.680 --> 20:26.631
this time,
The face was more convincing

20:26.698 --> 20:28.132
but I'm still not buying.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.335
You are not to pursue anyone or
anything until you have earned

20:31.403 --> 20:33.037
back the trust of the United
States Government.

20:33.105 --> 20:34.672
And if history is any
indication,

20:34.740 --> 20:36.274
then that might take a while.

20:48.683 --> 20:50.651
Okay, now where's the ball?

20:52.320 --> 20:54.255
This one?

20:54.322 --> 20:55.623
Really?

20:55.690 --> 20:57.892
You sure?

20:57.959 --> 20:59.927
Okay.

20:59.995 --> 21:03.731
Nope. You see, the secret
to the shell game is

21:03.799 --> 21:06.100
the ball's not in any of these.

21:07.953 --> 21:09.903
It's right here in my pocket.

21:09.955 --> 21:13.941
Once you know all the cons,
you'll never be a sucker.

21:14.009 --> 21:16.210
WOMAN: Your daughter needs
a father she can rely on, Jack!

21:16.278 --> 21:17.761
JACK: She can
count on me!

21:17.846 --> 21:19.430
Really? Is that why you're
asking for money again?

21:19.514 --> 21:20.914
Look, whatever you
can spare now,

21:20.966 --> 21:23.083
I'll double in a month.
You know I'm good for it.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.885
You're not welcome
here anymore. I'm sorry.

21:24.936 --> 21:27.288
Just let me say good-bye first.
Okay, okay, I get it.

21:27.355 --> 21:29.223
No. I can't imagine what
it must be like

21:29.291 --> 21:31.091
for that sweet girl to
constantly say good-bye

21:31.159 --> 21:33.227
to her father.

21:33.278 --> 21:35.196
She deserves better.

21:49.211 --> 21:50.544
What...?

21:53.548 --> 21:55.716
I don't want to live
with Grandma any more.

21:55.783 --> 21:57.651
I'm coming with you.
No, I don't think

21:57.719 --> 21:59.320
that's a good idea.
But I brought this.

21:59.387 --> 22:00.588
You need it, right?

22:04.226 --> 22:05.926
I can't, sweetie.
This is your money.

22:05.977 --> 22:08.162
But I know you're good for it.

22:08.230 --> 22:10.698
Plus, we don't need that money

22:10.765 --> 22:12.766
to have an adventure together.

22:15.570 --> 22:18.472
You're right... all we
need is you and me.

22:28.416 --> 22:30.317
You want some ice cream?

22:30.385 --> 22:31.886
No.

22:33.988 --> 22:36.006
I'm sorry my advice
didn't pan out.

22:36.091 --> 22:39.460
Is that why you're here,
because you were worried?

22:39.527 --> 22:42.463
Yeah. A skosh.

22:42.530 --> 22:43.998
Here.

22:44.065 --> 22:45.999
What's wrong?

22:49.187 --> 22:51.639
It's a work thing, I probably
shouldn't discuss it.

22:51.706 --> 22:54.808
Come on, give your
old man a chance.

22:54.859 --> 22:56.810
I do know a thing or
two about criminals.

22:56.861 --> 23:00.414
Maybe I can help.

23:00.482 --> 23:02.917
Okay, well, there are
these three brothers

23:02.984 --> 23:04.818
called the Klugs,
and they are never

23:04.869 --> 23:06.487
in the same place
at the same time,

23:06.538 --> 23:08.856
but they're going to be in L.A.
for their sister's wedding,

23:08.924 --> 23:10.624
and they always carry around
this device with them,

23:10.692 --> 23:13.894
called the Zephyr, but they
rotate it amongst themselves,

23:13.962 --> 23:16.597
and, um...

23:16.665 --> 23:18.732
you know, never mind,
this is...

23:18.800 --> 23:20.834
No, I'm listening.

23:20.902 --> 23:22.052
Your mark are the Klugs,

23:22.137 --> 23:23.671
and the Zephyr's the package.

23:23.738 --> 23:25.806
Right.

23:25.873 --> 23:27.874
Right, but the problem is
the wedding reception that

23:27.926 --> 23:30.210
they're supposed to be at
is one of Daphne's cons.

23:30.211 --> 23:34.548
Any way we could make that
wedding reception happen?

23:34.616 --> 23:36.951
Daphne's records did say that
she had never met the Gerlichs

23:37.002 --> 23:39.203
in person, but even
if I convince them

23:39.287 --> 23:40.871
that it's still on,
how can I possibly

23:40.956 --> 23:42.990
throw a $100,000 wedding

23:43.041 --> 23:45.392
in 24 hours with
no CIA resources?

23:45.460 --> 23:48.462
'Cause darling, you got me.

23:48.530 --> 23:50.831
Now, I know you guys
are all used to having

23:50.882 --> 23:53.183
some high-tech resources
at your fingertips,

23:53.268 --> 23:55.219
but everything I know,
I learned in the '80s

23:55.303 --> 23:57.805
when VCRs and rollerblades
were the cutting edge,

23:57.872 --> 23:59.390
so just bear with me.

23:59.474 --> 24:02.009
Especially you, Chuck.

24:02.077 --> 24:04.011
Just wanted to thank you guys
for including me on this.

24:04.079 --> 24:06.714
Always wanted to
pull a con, so...

24:06.781 --> 24:08.549
Daphne Peralta promised

24:08.616 --> 24:10.351
the Gerlichs a lavish reception

24:10.418 --> 24:12.720
at the Grand Ambassador
Hotel Ballroom.

24:12.787 --> 24:14.388
(whistles)
That is beautiful.

24:14.456 --> 24:17.858
Unfortunately, the ballroom
was booked months in advance

24:17.926 --> 24:19.443
for Tammy Katz's Bat Mitzvah.

24:19.527 --> 24:21.729
So it's a no-go.
Not necessarily.

24:21.796 --> 24:24.081
JACK:
<i>Bat Mitzvah starts at 8:00,</i>

24:24.165 --> 24:27.434
<i>and our reception</i>
<i>begins at 6:30.</i>

24:27.502 --> 24:29.103
Ma'am.
Can I help you?

24:29.170 --> 24:32.206
SARAH (Jersey accent): So you gonna
act like you don't know who I am now?

24:32.273 --> 24:35.743
Daphne Peralta, Tammy Katz's
Bat Mitzvah coordinator.

24:35.810 --> 24:37.211
Now per Tammy,

24:37.262 --> 24:39.463
I called in advance to
ensure I'd have the room

24:39.547 --> 24:42.116
for two hours before the party.

24:42.183 --> 24:44.585
Tammy's got a theme

being around.

Truth is, I, uh...

28:05.221 --> 28:07.089
I never thought my little
girl would settle down.

28:09.092 --> 28:10.809
I thought you'd end
up more like me,

28:10.877 --> 28:12.678
just one adventure

28:12.729 --> 28:15.314

28:17.267 --> 28:20.352
It was.

28:20.420 --> 28:23.388
But, um, I found
a home here, a good one,

28:23.440 --> 28:25.941
and I'm happy.

28:26.025 --> 28:27.126
I'm sorry, Dad.

28:31.364 --> 28:32.965
(door bangs)

28:36.419 --> 28:37.903
Got my eyes on
the Klug brothers.

28:37.971 --> 28:40.255
They're armed and dangerous.
CASEY: Be careful.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.240
You ready for this?

28:42.292 --> 28:44.242
Just like old times, kid.

28:46.096 --> 28:47.379
All right, Sarah. You're up.
CHUCK:

28:47.430 --> 28:49.581
Klug number one is
approaching the bar.

28:51.935 --> 28:53.268
(Jersey accent):
Mr. Klug, hello.

28:53.353 --> 28:55.554
Daphne Peralta,
wedding planner.

28:55.622 --> 28:56.722
Are you enjoying the party?

28:56.773 --> 28:59.124
Yes, it's very nice.
Although

28:59.192 --> 29:00.442
it wouldn't be
the same without your

29:00.527 --> 29:02.594
extraordinarily generous
gift to the Gerlichs.

29:02.662 --> 29:04.029
The toaster?

29:04.097 --> 29:06.231
No, silly.
The open bar.

29:10.236 --> 29:11.370
No, no, no.

29:11.437 --> 29:12.738
This is a mistake.

29:12.789 --> 29:14.473
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know,

29:14.541 --> 29:16.408
I've got your credit card
on file in the back,

29:16.476 --> 29:18.477
and if you just follow me,
I'm sure we can

29:18.545 --> 29:19.945
sort this mess out, okay?
Come on.

29:22.882 --> 29:23.949
SARAH:
<i>Again, I'm so</i>

29:24.000 --> 29:25.968
sorry for the
inconvenience, dear.

29:26.052 --> 29:27.052
It's no problem.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.761
Got mine.

29:35.812 --> 29:38.013
MORGAN: I'm so sorry about the spill.
I'm an imperfect man.

29:38.097 --> 29:39.348
I'm sure that we have
something back here

29:39.432 --> 29:40.532
that can get the stain out.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.401
Coming in here!

29:47.824 --> 29:49.608
Spy high-five!

29:49.676 --> 29:52.478
Casey? Two Klugs down.

29:52.545 --> 29:55.197
One to go.

30:04.657 --> 30:06.625
Oop... scratch that,
I've got a bogey.

30:06.676 --> 30:08.994
I need someone else to
cover Klug number three.

30:16.936 --> 30:18.303
Hey, hey!

30:18.354 --> 30:19.638
Hey, friend!

30:19.689 --> 30:21.807
How you doing?
Do I know you?

30:21.858 --> 30:24.610
Oh, oh, sorry, my bad.
It's Spenser Finn.

30:26.696 --> 30:28.647
KATHLEEN:
Alex!

30:32.719 --> 30:34.219
(sighs)

30:34.287 --> 30:36.054
Sure didn't want it
to happen this way.

30:36.122 --> 30:38.156
Kath. What are
you doing here?

30:38.224 --> 30:40.259
I followed you
from the Buy More.

30:40.326 --> 30:41.743
(laughing)

30:41.828 --> 30:43.028
Unbelievable.

30:43.079 --> 30:45.464
I can't believe you
dated Parisa, too?

30:45.532 --> 30:47.599
Who didn't?

30:47.667 --> 30:49.701
Hey, tell you what... why don't
we just go drink a toast

30:49.769 --> 30:51.420
to her, all right?
Good stuff's in the back.

30:51.504 --> 30:52.504
Come on.

30:57.944 --> 31:00.896
I don't understand.

31:00.980 --> 31:04.550
We had your funeral.

31:04.617 --> 31:08.854
I was given your flag.

31:08.905 --> 31:10.155
But you didn't die.

31:11.257 --> 31:14.426
You... just left?

31:14.494 --> 31:17.195
You left me for... what?

31:17.263 --> 31:18.897
CHUCK (over comm): Casey,
we've neutralized the Klugs.

31:18.965 --> 31:20.232
Let's get out of here.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.668
To work part-time
as a security guard

31:22.735 --> 31:24.202
and moonlight at the Buy More?

31:24.270 --> 31:26.371
Really can't talk to you
about this right now.

31:26.439 --> 31:27.706
Please. You need to leave.

31:27.774 --> 31:30.241
I talked to Alex, and, uh...

31:30.293 --> 31:31.577
she already knew.

31:31.644 --> 31:36.682
She thinks you're some kind
of... hero, or something.

31:36.749 --> 31:38.250
That you work for
the government.

31:38.318 --> 31:43.855
She wanted to
believe it so much.

31:43.923 --> 31:45.324
I guess I did too.

31:45.391 --> 31:46.808
Casey, where are you?
CHUCK:

31:46.893 --> 31:49.595
You should go.

31:49.662 --> 31:53.632
But only if you promise
to tell Alex the truth.

31:53.700 --> 31:58.337
You want to be a part of
her life, you owe her that.

31:58.404 --> 32:00.672
I don't want to lie to anyone.

32:00.740 --> 32:02.808
Then don't.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.385
Hey. Where's the DJ?

32:13.453 --> 32:14.720
He needs to make
an announcement.

32:14.787 --> 32:16.388
They're just about
to cut the cake.

32:16.455 --> 32:18.123
Oh, the cake.
Right, right.

32:18.174 --> 32:20.659
Uh, the DJ will be back
in a minute, I promise.

32:20.727 --> 32:22.844
He's in the bathroom,
so... don't worry.

32:23.963 --> 32:25.814
What am I looking for?

32:25.898 --> 32:29.101
Well, the Zephyr's small,
like a portable hard drive.

32:29.152 --> 32:30.635
Bruno's clean.

32:30.687 --> 32:31.987
SARAH:
So is Paulie.

32:32.071 --> 32:33.939
This one, too.

32:33.990 --> 32:36.174
Then where's the device?

32:36.242 --> 32:38.877
How do none of them have it?

32:40.480 --> 32:43.248
Guys, listen to me... people are
getting restless, all right?

32:43.315 --> 32:46.351
The father of the bride
wants to cut the cake.

32:46.419 --> 32:47.669
And in case
everybody has forgot,

32:47.754 --> 32:50.088
the cake is made of Styrofoam.

32:50.156 --> 32:51.757
(groans)

32:51.824 --> 32:53.842
I don't get it.
I mean my flash said

32:53.926 --> 32:55.494
that one of the Klug brothers

32:55.561 --> 32:57.629
keeps the Zephyr
on him at all times.

32:57.697 --> 32:58.764
(fingers snap)

32:58.831 --> 33:00.632
It's a shell game.
What?

33:00.683 --> 33:02.034
You're right.
The Klugs are just decoys

33:02.101 --> 33:03.935
to keep everybody distracted.

33:04.003 --> 33:05.837
They always have been,
but we didn't know it

33:05.888 --> 33:07.806
because they've never been in the
same place at the same time.

33:07.874 --> 33:10.142
In the game, the ball
is always close by.

33:10.193 --> 33:12.010
Which means someone else
here has the Zephyr.

33:15.181 --> 33:16.732
Coming through, coming through,
coming through.

33:16.816 --> 33:18.033
That knife is very dirty.

33:18.117 --> 33:19.684
This is their moment.

33:24.690 --> 33:26.625
(high-pitched squeaking)

33:26.693 --> 33:28.910
(crowd groaning)

33:30.096 --> 33:32.264
The cake is made of Styrofoam,

33:32.331 --> 33:33.365
and you knew it.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.133
What's really going on here?

33:35.201 --> 33:37.135
Where are my sons?

33:37.203 --> 33:39.137
Who do you work for?

33:39.205 --> 33:40.756
Daphne Peralta.

33:41.641 --> 33:43.508
Let's talk outside.

33:43.576 --> 33:45.010
We need to get back out there.

33:45.061 --> 33:48.547
MORGAN: Listen, there's no
reason for the gun, sir.

33:48.614 --> 33:51.983
I mean, Mr. Father of the Bride.
Morgan, where is he taking you?

33:52.051 --> 33:55.053
Oh, what a lovely
parking garage.

33:55.104 --> 33:56.271
No, no, no, no, no.
Hold on a second.

33:56.355 --> 33:57.389
I am nobody.

33:57.457 --> 33:58.590
I'm nobody!

33:58.658 --> 34:00.409
There'd virtually
be no consequence

34:00.493 --> 34:01.827
in you letting me go.

34:01.894 --> 34:03.862
Then the same goes for killing you.
What?!

34:03.930 --> 34:05.831
Freeze! Put your gun down!
You're under arrest!

34:08.634 --> 34:09.835
Chuck!

34:10.902 --> 34:12.337
Morgan!

34:13.072 --> 34:14.672
Hey!

34:14.739 --> 34:16.942
You got no place to go.

34:17.009 --> 34:18.376
(muffled yell)

34:21.347 --> 34:22.848
Hi, Casey.

34:22.915 --> 34:24.750
Hi, Morgan.

34:25.851 --> 34:28.186
Sorry, Casey.

34:29.922 --> 34:33.358
You wouldn't risk
your partner's life.

34:33.426 --> 34:34.659
You won't pull trigger.

34:40.099 --> 34:42.199
You couldn't be
more wrong, my friend.

34:42.268 --> 34:44.536
Listen...

34:44.603 --> 34:46.571
Can I call you friend?

34:48.373 --> 34:50.942
What is your dad doing?
Just give him a minute.

34:51.010 --> 34:53.612
This man is going to shoot you
and he is not going to miss.

34:55.181 --> 34:56.782
But I'm hoping

34:56.849 --> 34:57.883
that he doesn't have
to kill you.

34:57.950 --> 34:58.800
See, I-I-I...

34:58.885 --> 35:00.152
I've got a daughter, too.

35:00.219 --> 35:02.053
And based on
the situation here,

35:02.121 --> 35:06.925
I'm thinking you're not
the best father in the world.

35:08.694 --> 35:09.961
Join the club.

35:10.029 --> 35:12.564
I guess the only thing

35:12.632 --> 35:15.233
we can really hope
for is that, someday,

35:15.301 --> 35:18.270
our little girls might be happy

35:18.321 --> 35:20.839
despite us...
and yours is.

35:20.907 --> 35:22.474
She's upstairs right now

35:22.542 --> 35:24.276
in her white dress.

35:24.343 --> 35:26.978
And here you are,

35:27.029 --> 35:29.548
about to take a bullet
in the head.

35:31.818 --> 35:34.119
So... do one thing for her...

35:34.187 --> 35:36.421
Yeah.

35:36.489 --> 35:39.224
...put the gun down.

35:55.274 --> 35:56.341
Turn around.

35:59.278 --> 36:02.314
(sirens wailing)

36:08.187 --> 36:09.988
Colonel John Casey.

36:10.056 --> 36:11.356
NSA.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.183
The behavior you two displayed
with your wedding planner

36:28.645 --> 36:30.429
...was unprofessional
and unacceptable.

36:30.497 --> 36:34.300
General, I promise I will
never fake a flash again.

36:34.368 --> 36:37.203
We are very sorry, General.

36:37.271 --> 36:39.205
However, my superiors
were quite impressed

36:39.273 --> 36:40.406
you did
with the exceptional work

36:40.474 --> 36:41.841
in acquiring the Zephyr device.

36:41.909 --> 36:44.744
Though I still question how
you managed to accomplish

36:44.812 --> 36:47.313
that task without
any CIA resources...

36:47.381 --> 36:50.550
Uh, well, it-it was
really, um...

36:50.617 --> 36:52.585
You could chalk it up to...

36:52.653 --> 36:55.972
I have a feeling
the less I know the better.

36:56.056 --> 36:57.456
Welcome back.

36:57.524 --> 36:58.975
You're dismissed.

36:59.960 --> 37:03.229
That went better than expected.

37:03.296 --> 37:04.630
I thought so.
Yeah.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.903
You leaving already?

37:10.971 --> 37:12.738
I got wind of a wealthy
Alabama couple

37:12.806 --> 37:13.956
looking into orange futures,

37:14.024 --> 37:16.492
and I'm pretty sure
I own a bunch of those.

37:16.577 --> 37:17.660
So...
Huh.

37:17.744 --> 37:19.111
I'm on the next flight out.

37:19.162 --> 37:21.614
Okay, but Sarah's on
her way home.

37:21.665 --> 37:23.182
She'll be here soon.

37:26.169 --> 37:28.921
We've never been
great at good-byes.

37:28.989 --> 37:32.425
Look, I-I know that you never got
a proper invitation in the mail,

37:32.492 --> 37:34.343
or anything, but just watching

37:34.428 --> 37:35.995
you and Sarah...

37:36.063 --> 37:38.364
Look, I know
she'd never say it,

37:38.432 --> 37:39.732
but it would mean
the world to her

37:39.800 --> 37:42.852
if you came to our wedding,
and walked her down the aisle.

37:42.936 --> 37:46.005
You should follow
my daughter's lead.

37:46.073 --> 37:47.840
She knows me very well.

37:47.908 --> 37:49.642
I wish you both the best,

37:49.693 --> 37:54.030
but I'm afraid I won't be able
to make the wedding.

37:54.114 --> 37:56.015
What do you mean?
You're her dad.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.200
I've always been a better
con man than a father.

37:58.285 --> 38:00.369
I made a promise to myself,
a long time ago,

38:00.454 --> 38:03.055
to never promise her something
that I couldn't give her.

38:03.123 --> 38:06.325
She's had her heart
broken too many times by me.

38:06.393 --> 38:10.129
I... I just don't want
to do it again.

38:10.197 --> 38:14.533
Just, hey, just-just...
just stay for dinner at least.

38:14.601 --> 38:16.235
Please?

38:23.744 --> 38:25.711
All right, Charlie,
I'll stay for dinner.

38:25.762 --> 38:29.398
Good, good. Thank you.

38:29.483 --> 38:32.685
This is my fault.

38:32.753 --> 38:36.555
I just never thought
I'd see you again.

38:39.826 --> 38:41.794
She does that.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.562
Hmm?
Alex.

38:43.630 --> 38:45.698
That thing with your hand.

38:45.766 --> 38:49.335
Alex does that
when she's nervous.

38:49.402 --> 38:50.770
Oh.

38:50.837 --> 38:54.240
I hadn't realized.
Never noticed.

38:56.543 --> 39:00.546
Alex is amazing.
You should be proud.

39:00.614 --> 39:02.965
You've done a great job, Kath.

39:04.785 --> 39:08.554
Well, it'll be easier for her,
now that I know.

39:08.605 --> 39:10.222
Well, I didn't just
do it for her.

39:10.290 --> 39:12.658
Look at you.

39:12.726 --> 39:16.228
You're a soldier,
you're a hero.

39:18.465 --> 39:21.600
You have everything
that you've ever wanted.

39:25.205 --> 39:26.238
Hey, baby.

39:26.306 --> 39:27.657
Hey.

39:27.741 --> 39:31.160
So I was doing a little research
and I was thinking

39:31.244 --> 39:33.946
that a courthouse wedding
might be kind of romantic,

39:34.014 --> 39:36.448
or at the very least,
within our new budget.

39:36.500 --> 39:40.086
That sounds nice.
Mm-hmm.

39:40.153 --> 39:43.022
And I got all the ingredients
for dinner with your dad.

39:43.090 --> 39:47.693
I'm making your favorite...
chicken pepperoni.

39:47.761 --> 39:50.329
Where is he?

39:50.397 --> 39:52.331
He's gone.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.474
Did he tell you he was leaving?

40:01.541 --> 40:02.842
He didn't have to.

40:02.909 --> 40:04.176
It's what my dad does, Chuck.

40:04.244 --> 40:05.611
He just leaves.

40:07.414 --> 40:10.649
Once you know all the cons,
you can never be a sucker.
