01:30.625 --> 01:32.616
I am not akiller

02:33.083 --> 02:34.448
She's in usa now.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.915
We can get to her if you want.

02:39.042 --> 02:42.660
Okay. It'll cost 10,000 us dollars.

02:42.917 --> 02:44.077
What do you want to do?

03:04.375 --> 03:06.036
Yes?

03:08.625 --> 03:10.616
What happened?

03:13.333 --> 03:16.040
Well, I'll come see you
one of these days.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.164
I understand,

03:19.458 --> 03:22.120
but you call me at 5:00 am
after 2 years...

03:25.708 --> 03:27.915
That's 200 kilometers!

03:32.708 --> 03:36.121
Fine, I'll be there in a few hours.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.077
Bye.

03:41.292 --> 03:42.748
Who was it?

04:01.125 --> 04:04.788
Hear the sounds? Beware of the devil,
he's always around.

04:05.042 --> 04:07.784
In pre-school, showers, under tables,
at the funfair.

04:07.792 --> 04:09.623
I can hug you, got 20 cents?

04:30.292 --> 04:32.408
Okay, let's get started.

04:35.417 --> 04:39.114
You said to me: "If I start
turning into a cop, warn me."

04:39.500 --> 04:40.740
Yeah?

04:40.750 --> 04:42.615
You're turning into a cop.

04:43.708 --> 04:46.620
If I come to court
while you're giving a ruling

04:46.625 --> 04:48.616
and butt in, what would you do?

04:48.625 --> 04:53.073
I'm not butting in. But after all we did,
you want to die alone?

06:53.750 --> 06:56.036
Hero!

06:56.042 --> 06:57.657
I almost died alone.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.991
What do you want? I'm not a cop.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.457
Buddy, this is paradise.

07:27.792 --> 07:29.202
Francesco...

07:30.583 --> 07:31.948
Are you ditching me?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.618
What? After all you've done for me?

07:37.417 --> 07:40.489
Because of what I've done for you
or because you care for me?

07:41.583 --> 07:43.289
I don't care for you,

07:44.125 --> 07:45.490
I love you.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.373
Fuck off.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.537
This shining force,

07:54.708 --> 07:58.280
this sensation of a body
coming from another body,

07:58.292 --> 08:00.203
I'm afraid I'll forget it.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.244
What's it like after?

08:06.542 --> 08:08.749
It depends on too many factors.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.832
You, your dreams,

08:14.458 --> 08:15.994
your man.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.789
Don't you ever get bored?

08:26.792 --> 08:29.204
What do you mean? In bed?

08:31.958 --> 08:33.664
Everywhere.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.164
No.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.408
Love is delicate, my friend.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.786
It can shatter easily.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.118
She'll leave.

09:28.458 --> 09:29.948
With the baby?

09:31.583 --> 09:34.074
She's looking for research jobs
in Washington.

09:37.292 --> 09:38.623
You peeked at her computer?

09:42.333 --> 09:43.948
Help me.

10:38.833 --> 10:39.993
I made it.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.240
- First?
- Fourth.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.081
I knew you'd get in.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.290
I couldn't have done it without you.

10:45.292 --> 10:46.828
No cliches.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.032
That was quick.

11:13.583 --> 11:15.164
You look tired, Giovanni.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.787
I'm going to tell you a story now.

11:21.792 --> 11:25.330
Then I'll ask you a four-word question.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.540
You'll answer yes or no.

11:28.542 --> 11:29.907
I'll handle the rest.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.289
Go on.

11:33.458 --> 11:36.416
"Judge mastropaolo killed at home:
Deputy prencipe last to see him alive"

11:47.292 --> 11:49.328
They say I killed him.

11:51.042 --> 11:52.327
Are they nuts?

11:52.917 --> 11:55.954
I was the last to see him alive
and there are no witnesses.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.039
I can't, francesco.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.990
Alice.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.078
Alice?

12:14.125 --> 12:16.366
Why bring up Alice?

12:16.375 --> 12:19.492
Can't I have my own problems?
Don't I exist too?

12:21.458 --> 12:25.576
One clean, precise shot, and it's over.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.333
This man merely didn't notice.

12:30.708 --> 12:36.157
Because noticing would mean admitting,
and admitting means submitting

12:36.167 --> 12:39.910
to a sort of originality, diversity.

12:40.083 --> 12:43.701
As sandro penna said: "Happy
being different if one is different,

12:44.583 --> 12:48.121
but woe betide being different
if one is ordinary."

12:48.542 --> 12:50.373
And this guilty man

12:50.833 --> 12:54.826
is guilty of not having noticed,

12:55.417 --> 12:58.033
and must account for...

13:10.625 --> 13:12.331
Excuse me.

13:15.542 --> 13:17.157
What'd I tell you?

13:17.167 --> 13:18.623
Look at him...

13:19.833 --> 13:23.371
Giorgio, this is a disaster.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.741
You can't just leave,
the judge is pissed off.

13:25.750 --> 13:30.414
I noticed, I noticed that
she is my judge.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.499
She'll absolve or condemn me.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.661
Sure... she's your judge.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.456
Let's go home now.

13:44.542 --> 13:46.828
Come here, pal.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.664
Come here.

13:50.042 --> 13:52.249
Are you my friend? = yes.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.083
- Enough, let's go.
- Are you my friend?

13:57.875 --> 13:59.866
What the fuck are you doing?

14:00.333 --> 14:01.698
What the fuck?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.370
You were my friend, not his.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.164
Honey, everything is fine.

14:11.292 --> 14:14.864
Gimme the key, we'll open this drawer
and I'll be done with you.

14:26.417 --> 14:29.909
I haven't practiced law in ages,
find someone else.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.783
I need someone who cares for me, giorgio.

14:53.208 --> 14:55.995
Come meet him.
= I'm not interested.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.197
He's a freshman
and speaks six languages.

14:59.208 --> 15:01.950
Honest, brave, funny,

15:02.292 --> 15:04.578
unconventional, and handsome.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.995
In love with him? = there he is.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.664
Hey, that's mine.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.203
How much is it worth?

15:12.208 --> 15:14.324
- 3,000 dollars.
- 3,000?

15:14.333 --> 15:16.164
What's it for? = calls.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.740
Hello?

15:18.750 --> 15:23.449
Hey, I'm with a dumb-ass
who just spent 3,000 dollars

15:23.625 --> 15:25.911
for a plastic brick with buttons.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.283
My dad gave it to me.

15:28.292 --> 15:31.705
There's a guy with him
who's quite attractive,

15:31.708 --> 15:34.666
he doesn't look so smart,
but clever.

15:35.208 --> 15:37.540
I bet he'd steal
his girlfriend in a blink.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.161
Depends on the girl.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.453
There's a guy sitting on his own,

15:44.833 --> 15:47.370
probably trying to attract attention.

15:47.375 --> 15:49.411
Looks smart but not clever.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.703
He's 19, right? Looks old.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.663
I'd say he's a braggart
who cries when he's alone.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.828
- What'll I say?
- Introduce yourself.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.037
- Francesco.
- Giovanni, my best friend.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.706
Let's start with the call.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.039
Phone records show

16:09.208 --> 16:13.747
the victim called you
Wednesday, October 27 at 5:08 A.M.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.957
You stated you got dressed quickly,

16:15.958 --> 16:19.155
got into the car, and drove to
Santa caterina di nardo.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.869
You also stated that night was...

16:21.875 --> 16:26.414
Strenuous, shall we say,
on an intimate level.

16:27.042 --> 16:29.499
And you vomited two times,

16:29.500 --> 16:32.207
still woozy from the alcohol and food.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.039
Why?

16:38.583 --> 16:41.575
- Why what?
- Why did you go anyway?

16:43.042 --> 16:44.498
Because Giovanni asked me.

16:44.917 --> 16:49.160
The request for professional advice
from a friend

16:49.625 --> 16:54.073
doesn't seem like a reason
to take the wheel in that shape.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.625
Giovanni wasn't just a friend for me.

16:58.292 --> 17:01.910
- I owe him everything.
- Okay, your story is clear.

17:02.458 --> 17:05.415
Giovanni mastropaolo
was like a brother to you

17:05.416 --> 17:07.703
so when a brother calls...

17:07.875 --> 17:12.368
How come you hadn't seen
this brother in two years?

17:27.958 --> 17:29.869
What are you doing here?

17:30.417 --> 17:32.703
They found the mayor's lover doped up

17:32.708 --> 17:35.871
getting it on with two bouncers
at a club.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.697
I want to question her now, hear me,
so I can nail him.

17:41.292 --> 17:44.489
- Just say yes or no.
- Did you call the da?

17:46.917 --> 17:48.953
You weren't this punctilious before.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.823
I miss francesco.

18:00.542 --> 18:01.657
Me too.

18:02.792 --> 18:03.998
How is he?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.250
Alone.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.198
Me too.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.289
Then we're not so alone.

18:14.292 --> 18:17.659
Listen, we'll talk about it
tomorrow in the office.

18:36.792 --> 18:39.909
There's no real reason.

18:39.917 --> 18:43.660
The separation,
my new position as special crime head.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.700
But my friendship with Giovanni
was never in question.

18:48.792 --> 18:52.614
After about two hours,
you reach this brother of yours

18:52.792 --> 18:55.955
you haven't seen in two years,
and it's 7:30.

18:57.542 --> 19:01.581
Then, at 7:50,
20 minutes later, you leave.

19:02.292 --> 19:05.364
You get in the car
and drive 200 km back home.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.573
Why so quick?

19:07.833 --> 19:11.405
After two years,
you must've had tons to catch up on.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.499
Yes, but it wasn't a social call.

19:14.042 --> 19:15.703
Giovanni had to arrest someone

19:16.167 --> 19:19.284
and he wanted my advice,
as friend and cop.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.537
Does this person have a name?
= no.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.789
Now's not the time for discretion.

19:25.792 --> 19:29.455
There's a corpse and your situation
is rather complicated.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.081
No discretion.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.033
Giovanni didn't tell me
and I didn't ask.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.706
You stated that:

19:41.042 --> 19:44.455
“Glovanni was investigating
a prominent politician

19:44.667 --> 19:49.582
involved in racketeering
to win public contracts.

19:49.583 --> 19:52.074
He wanted to know
what I'd do in his place."

19:53.917 --> 19:56.249
What did you tell him?
= to wait.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.616
The findings were shaky and...

19:59.083 --> 20:02.371
One wrong move
would've crushed the investigation.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.749
Did he appreciate your advice?

20:11.417 --> 20:13.829
- I don't think so.
- Why?

20:15.625 --> 20:18.913
I think he was disappointed
I wasn't a dare-devil like him.

20:21.917 --> 20:25.990
Can you tell me more
about this mysterious motorcycle?

20:27.917 --> 20:31.284
High-powered,
not sure what brand.

20:31.292 --> 20:32.327
Red.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.118
Bright red.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.248
What did you think when you saw it?

20:38.542 --> 20:40.828
I felt rather uneasy.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.407
And decided it wasn't my business.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.118
What?

20:46.917 --> 20:51.035
A judge in the front line
in the war against the mafia

20:51.042 --> 20:52.907
who's also your best friend,

20:52.917 --> 20:57.206
you see a high-powered motorcycle
by his house in the middle of nowhere

20:57.208 --> 20:58.869
and it's not your business?

21:11.042 --> 21:14.034
That's what I will never
forgive myself for.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.370
It's midnight, we're all worn out.

21:26.875 --> 21:31.118
In his home the only prints found
were yours and the maid's,

21:31.125 --> 21:33.616
but she has a rock-solid alibi.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.082
No sign of the mysterious motorcyclist.

21:36.417 --> 21:39.033
How do you explain this?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.616
Maybe he wiped them down.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.241
Why did you ask to be transferred
two years ago?

21:47.250 --> 21:48.615
A disagreement?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.956
No disagreement.

21:52.458 --> 21:56.531
After years away from home,
I wanted to go back.

21:59.875 --> 22:02.332
- There was...
- Go ahead.

22:03.125 --> 22:06.697
There was a picture on his desk.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.870
A picture of me in a frame.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.786
Can I have it?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.869
- A picture?
- Yes.

22:16.875 --> 22:20.788
The fact that he kept it there
means a lot to me.

22:22.167 --> 22:23.828
Will they arrest me? = no...

22:23.833 --> 22:26.996
They can't arrest a big shot cop
who answered every question.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.286
- They'll arrest me.
- Leave it to me.

22:31.667 --> 22:34.499
Thanks, giorgio. = for what?

22:34.500 --> 22:36.912
For agreeing to defend me.

22:41.125 --> 22:43.286
My father died two days ago.

22:44.833 --> 22:46.243
I'm sorry.

22:46.708 --> 22:48.994
- How'd he die?
- Heart attack.

22:49.792 --> 22:52.283
On the 32nd floor
of the Chrysler building,

22:52.292 --> 22:55.534
an argument with
another important lawyer.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.828
I'm not in his will.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.539
You have a right though.

23:00.542 --> 23:03.989
Expect me to contest it
in a New York court? With what money?

23:13.375 --> 23:15.741
Poor guy, he didn't deserve it.

23:17.917 --> 23:20.124
Nobody deserves it.

23:21.583 --> 23:24.655
- Because I believe in law.
- Law, my foot.

23:24.833 --> 23:28.621
You want to be a lawyer
to get money and girls, like your dad.

23:28.625 --> 23:29.831
No!

23:29.833 --> 23:31.789
He dumped us here when I was 8,

23:31.958 --> 23:34.870
I have no desire
to become like him.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.706
Are you nuts?

23:36.708 --> 23:39.495
The head of New York's best law firm

23:39.500 --> 23:42.242
who gives you 3,000 dollar phones!

23:42.250 --> 23:43.865
He's a bastard.

23:43.875 --> 23:45.365
A pig!

23:45.375 --> 23:47.115
- He's a man.
- That's nonsense.

23:47.917 --> 23:50.283
- It's the truth.
- It's your truth.

23:50.958 --> 23:53.995
- I want to see you at 50.
- You will, you'll see!

23:54.542 --> 23:58.034
Pal, the devil exists,
don't you forget that.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.874
Would you shut up for a second?

24:02.458 --> 24:03.538
Listen.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.073
Nice, what is it?

24:13.583 --> 24:15.744
- A masterpiece.
- Huh?

24:16.500 --> 24:18.161
Ever seen a masterpiece?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.037
Every day, when I look in the mirror.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.081
Freeze!

26:01.083 --> 26:02.289
It wasn't me.

26:02.542 --> 26:04.828
I'm telling you, it was.

26:05.708 --> 26:08.074
I wasn't there that night.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.869
I recall perfectly.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.912
It was a phenomenal operation,
me, terzi, and molino.

26:14.583 --> 26:16.494
Must've been someone else.

26:17.667 --> 26:22.161
With all those flowers you plant,
you've gotten confused.

26:23.167 --> 26:27.035
Or maybe your jealousy
warps your memories?

26:30.417 --> 26:32.578
Right, my memories have been warped...

26:37.000 --> 26:38.911
You want it all, francesco.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.616
You want to be the perfect father,
have a kinky lover,

26:44.083 --> 26:47.120
be rich but act like
you don't care about money,

26:47.792 --> 26:50.124
be dishonest but fair.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.995
But life doesn't work that way.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.824
Your actions cause reactions.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.039
- Beatrice, how do you do it?
- Do what?

27:05.167 --> 27:06.953
Be with a new man every night.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.199
I'm not with a new man every night.

27:09.208 --> 27:12.951
When the right guy shows up,
I go with him.

27:12.958 --> 27:15.165
And I plant a flower on my terrace.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.328
- You do what?
- Plant a flower.

27:18.417 --> 27:20.533
You should see the garden I have!

27:22.333 --> 27:23.743
Exactly...

27:24.375 --> 27:27.082
Anyway, you don't have to pay me,

27:27.083 --> 27:29.574
you should know by now.

27:29.583 --> 27:32.450
A few favors
in exchange for some pampering.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.949
And that's what we provide.

27:34.958 --> 27:37.745
And that's what we provide?

27:37.750 --> 27:39.661
Sounds like an infomercial.

27:40.375 --> 27:41.956
Beatrice, I need to go.

27:42.333 --> 27:46.030
You say we can't make love
'cause your wife is still on your mind,

27:46.042 --> 27:49.000
then 'cause I'm only 16,
then 'cause of your daughter.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.914
What do you want from me?

27:53.625 --> 27:55.411
I like your company.

27:57.750 --> 28:01.163
A guy like you
doesn't think about my company.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.490
A guy like you...

28:05.167 --> 28:06.282
What?

28:11.583 --> 28:13.039
Marry me.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.457
And what about all your flowers?

28:26.917 --> 28:28.532
You marry me.

29:43.875 --> 29:46.207
He was at the crime scene
when it happened.

29:46.208 --> 29:49.120
Nobody else was inside or outside,
he took off,

29:49.333 --> 29:52.166
lied about the motorcyclist,
the judge's questioning,

29:52.167 --> 29:53.782
and his relationship with him.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.699
Is that enough to convince a jury?

29:56.708 --> 30:01.657
Michele, this case has it all:
Method, words, tons of clues...

30:01.667 --> 30:04.534
But where's the damning evidence,
the real motive?

30:04.542 --> 30:06.453
It was him, I'm sure.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.416
He's fake. He's a shitty man.

30:11.833 --> 30:14.290
Paola, what's with you?

30:14.292 --> 30:18.205
You can't expect to go to trial
only once all doubts are removed.

30:19.458 --> 30:21.824
No one else could've done it.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.124
Want to drop everything?

30:25.125 --> 30:27.912
No, I never said that.
= then arrest him.

30:38.667 --> 30:39.667
You're late.

30:40.208 --> 30:42.324
Late? Didn't we say 10:00?

30:42.333 --> 30:44.244
It's 10:10.

30:44.917 --> 30:47.533
- So no school today...
- Don't be crazy.

30:47.542 --> 30:50.614
I studied all night
for my math test.

30:50.625 --> 30:52.991
Skip it and spend the day with me.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.331
Lucky me...

30:56.333 --> 30:58.324
Did you tell mom at least?

30:59.542 --> 31:01.248
We'll tell her together.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.162
So, where should we go?

31:15.792 --> 31:18.989
- It smells in here.
- It's been closed for 4 years.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.615
Why not sell it?

31:42.833 --> 31:44.915
Ready in 3 minutes.
Who'll set the table?

31:45.250 --> 31:47.081
Guess?

31:51.708 --> 31:53.539
Honey, will you help me?

31:54.125 --> 31:56.081
- No.
- Why not?

32:01.833 --> 32:03.869
Do you have plans after we eat?

32:04.250 --> 32:06.662
Well... I'll free myself up.

32:10.125 --> 32:12.616
Hold on, I'll go see who it is.

32:19.417 --> 32:20.953
Why the fuck are you here?

32:21.625 --> 32:23.411
I can't take it.

32:23.417 --> 32:26.534
Please, let's try to think rationally
about this nightmare.

32:28.458 --> 32:30.244
Who is it?

32:30.250 --> 32:31.706
Nobody, be right there.

32:31.708 --> 32:35.621
- I want you.
- But I want my wife and daughter.

32:36.042 --> 32:37.873
We messed up, let's backtrack.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.206
But we can't.

32:44.125 --> 32:47.162
Dad, will you close the shutters?

32:48.958 --> 32:51.290
The shutters... will you close them?

32:53.125 --> 32:54.615
Yes.

33:18.167 --> 33:19.452
Were you sleeping?

33:20.750 --> 33:24.572
I wanted to tell you
I'm staying at the station tonight.

33:25.292 --> 33:28.159
No, nothing big, just paperwork.

33:30.917 --> 33:32.578
Martina?

33:33.875 --> 33:36.207
Give her a kiss when she wakes up.

33:37.375 --> 33:39.491
Don't forget.

33:41.292 --> 33:42.748
All right.

33:42.750 --> 33:44.240
Goodnight.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.119
Where to?

34:06.125 --> 34:07.831
A party.

34:08.167 --> 34:09.748
A party?

34:10.125 --> 34:12.706
But I freed myself up for you.
= for me?

34:12.708 --> 34:15.666
Thanks, love.
So you won't get offended if I leave?

34:16.208 --> 34:18.072
Of course I will.

34:18.542 --> 34:21.079
Look at the flowers I got for you...

34:22.208 --> 34:24.290
I'm always here waiting for you.

34:37.667 --> 34:40.248
Just stop it with that key.

34:43.458 --> 34:47.996
I know you're angry but in that moment
I just let myself go.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.081
Your mom was busy saving lives

34:50.333 --> 34:53.530
and I felt alone, all right?

34:54.208 --> 34:55.789
You don't regret it.

34:58.500 --> 35:01.037
Of course I do, honey.
I lost it all.

35:01.042 --> 35:04.000
I lost you, I lost mom,
what else is left?

35:05.417 --> 35:08.204
I'm just asking you
to give me another chance.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.745
Right, another chance.

35:12.125 --> 35:15.037
Everybody's waiting for lottery tickets
to fall from the sky...

35:15.583 --> 35:19.405
Let's give it another try,
maybe this number will win.

35:19.792 --> 35:21.453
Grow up!

35:32.292 --> 35:34.078
Thirty.

35:36.083 --> 35:38.369
- Huh?
- Putin 30 Euros.

35:47.333 --> 35:50.575
I held you with my hands in the water,

35:51.333 --> 35:53.494
you kicked your feet and laughed.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.575
You were small but confident.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.825
I'd like to be in your place now.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.615
Here.

36:12.792 --> 36:15.033
"Protect your loved ones"?

36:16.292 --> 36:19.124
Don't tell mom,
it's an insurance policy.

36:19.125 --> 36:21.787
It's not much now,
but it'll grow.

36:23.042 --> 36:24.498
Like you.

36:26.083 --> 36:27.664
What's up, dad?

36:29.375 --> 36:32.617
Martina, you'll hear
lots of things about me,

36:32.792 --> 36:35.750
absurd, horrible things.

36:36.917 --> 36:39.283
Never believe them, okay?

36:39.667 --> 36:41.373
Promise?

36:45.833 --> 36:47.573
It'll all be fine.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.790
Go home, it's late.

36:51.458 --> 36:52.948
Go on.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.581
Go.

37:25.125 --> 37:28.663
Alice melazzi?
Francesco prencipe, police. May I?

37:28.667 --> 37:30.578
What's going on?

37:33.917 --> 37:36.454
We've been informed that

37:36.458 --> 37:39.495
drugs are being dealt in the building,
are you aware?

37:39.500 --> 37:41.991
No, I know nothing about it.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.457
Your father? = yes.

37:46.958 --> 37:50.405
- Does he live here?
- He died in 1990.

37:51.958 --> 37:54.665
- Is this your mom?
- No, it's me.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.323
What's going on?

37:58.458 --> 38:01.746
Do you know giorgio annichiarico?
=I do but...

38:01.750 --> 38:03.365
But?

38:03.375 --> 38:06.082
He's pursuing me but I don't like him.

38:07.833 --> 38:09.039
You should.

38:10.333 --> 38:11.823
Giorgio's a good guy.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.248
No!

38:49.417 --> 38:51.328
Nobody's here!

38:51.833 --> 38:54.199
Excuse me, I need the phone.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.328
It's urgent.

39:07.708 --> 39:09.869
Professor, it's me.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.079
Yes, I need your help.

39:15.750 --> 39:18.583
I'm in deep shit
but I didn't do anything.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.411
Yes, okay.

39:22.792 --> 39:24.248
Thanks.

41:22.542 --> 41:26.490
Oh tender kisses

41:29.042 --> 41:34.491
oh sweet caresses

41:35.667 --> 41:39.660
while, trembling...

41:41.417 --> 41:44.204
Alice, for 20 years I've been saying
I love you.

41:44.208 --> 41:46.540
And for 20 years I've said I don't.

41:46.542 --> 41:49.614
- Shall I kick him off?
- No, he'll leave.

41:49.625 --> 41:53.117
- Or I'll call the police.
- And report me for loving you?

41:53.417 --> 41:55.453
Get out of my fucking life!

42:00.292 --> 42:01.532
Hello?

42:03.000 --> 42:05.082
The jail of potenza...

42:05.083 --> 42:07.290
Or potenza's a jail?

42:07.958 --> 42:09.914
Alice, I have to leave.

42:10.417 --> 42:14.535
You'd condemn him, wouldn't you?
Know why?

42:14.542 --> 42:17.579
Because you're incapable of loving!

42:17.583 --> 42:19.494
There's no need to fear love,

42:19.500 --> 42:22.492
don't be afraid,
there's no fear in love.

42:25.833 --> 42:26.868
That's it...

42:33.208 --> 42:36.496
So in 11 years, Alice went out with:

42:37.083 --> 42:40.246
A banker, a volleyball coach,

42:40.542 --> 42:42.908
two brothers who are mailmen,

42:42.917 --> 42:46.489
a mechanic, a Latin teacher,
but to no avail!

42:46.500 --> 42:49.492
Know why? Because she loves me.

42:50.375 --> 42:52.866
She doesn't know it yet
but she loves me.

43:01.375 --> 43:03.411
- Morning.
- Good morning.

43:04.333 --> 43:05.948
Did they arrest you?

43:09.208 --> 43:11.119
Want a word with your lawyer?
= no.

43:14.833 --> 43:16.323
Shall we proceed? = yes.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.867
- Do you plan on cooperating?
- Yes.

43:20.292 --> 43:22.499
You confirm the conversation

43:22.500 --> 43:26.789
you had with mastropaolo
on the morning of October 27th

43:27.667 --> 43:30.158
was a sort of consultancy

43:30.167 --> 43:32.783
about whether it was wise
to arrest a major politician?

43:32.792 --> 43:34.703
We confirm.

43:34.708 --> 43:38.075
In judge mastropaolo's files
there's no trace of this investigation.

43:38.875 --> 43:41.833
His closest associates
know nothing about it either.

43:42.250 --> 43:45.822
You didn't find a file
because he had yet to create one.

43:46.708 --> 43:49.245
So he asked advice
on a hon-existent case?

43:49.250 --> 43:52.037
Existent but not official.

43:52.042 --> 43:53.248
Easy...

43:53.875 --> 43:57.993
His co-workers stated that the judge
no longer trusted you,

43:58.625 --> 44:00.741
and revoked all of your power.

44:01.125 --> 44:05.664
Giovanni and I were close friends.
= so his co-workers lied?

44:05.667 --> 44:09.205
I didn't say that.
That's their impression, I respect that.

44:09.792 --> 44:13.489
The judge had taken away your cases
and stopped speaking to you,

44:13.500 --> 44:15.491
those are facts not impressions.

44:15.500 --> 44:18.333
Yes, but these facts
are being interpreted incorrectly.

44:19.333 --> 44:23.576
I think Giovanni was disappointed
I left his office.

44:23.583 --> 44:25.494
I promised I never would.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.036
Would you like to proceed?

44:33.333 --> 44:36.700
Mr. prencipe, who do you think
killed judge mastropaolo?

44:38.125 --> 44:40.241
I'd give anything to know.

44:41.792 --> 44:44.158
He was killed between 7:30 - 8:00.

44:44.167 --> 44:48.206
You said when you left at 7:50
he was still alive,

44:48.500 --> 44:52.869
so the gun must've been fired
between 7:50 - 8:00.

44:52.875 --> 44:54.786
Such a small timespan...

44:55.375 --> 44:58.162
Either the killer was hiding in his home

44:58.167 --> 45:01.455
or he came in and out
in that tiny interval

45:01.708 --> 45:03.744
without leaving a trace.

45:07.250 --> 45:09.366
You're a deputy, I'm asking you:

45:09.375 --> 45:13.914
Could someone other than the defendant
have killed judge mastropaolo?

45:15.333 --> 45:20.032
Many judicial errors are due to
incorrect assessment of the time of death.

45:20.708 --> 45:23.825
We must verify if the coroner
properly considered

45:23.833 --> 45:25.949
the internal and external temperatures.

45:26.750 --> 45:28.115
Indeed.

45:28.125 --> 45:30.161
Rigor mortis,

45:30.167 --> 45:31.703
hypostatic staining...

45:32.750 --> 45:37.323
The 7:30 - 8:00 timespan
could even change by 30 minutes.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.697
That's my reply as deputy,
want my reply as defendant?

45:42.333 --> 45:43.493
Go on.

45:44.583 --> 45:48.952
Someone else must've killed him
because I didn't do it.

45:49.542 --> 45:53.330
And is this someone else
the red motorcycle owner?

45:53.500 --> 45:55.866
I didn't say that.

45:55.875 --> 45:59.618
The red motorcycle was parked
by the villa when I left.

45:59.625 --> 46:02.788
Have you looked for tire marks
in his driveway?

46:04.417 --> 46:08.285
The picture you saw on his desk
is not there.

46:08.958 --> 46:10.118
What?

46:10.500 --> 46:14.413
The agents searched the place
inch by inch, no luck.

46:14.708 --> 46:17.871
But I saw it, it was there,
my picture in a leather frame.

46:19.208 --> 46:20.994
Then someone took it.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.956
Thanks.

46:35.333 --> 46:37.449
Here we have...

46:43.958 --> 46:46.665
Wait, what's this new element?

46:47.000 --> 46:50.868
A farmer who lives a few miles
from mastropaolo's villa.

46:50.875 --> 46:54.788
On October 27th
he was picking cactus fruit there

46:55.250 --> 46:57.457
around 8:00 am.

46:57.458 --> 47:00.575
He claims to have seen a blue Mercedes

47:00.583 --> 47:03.370
parked there, which then sped off quickly

47:03.375 --> 47:07.243
"like an outlaw being chased by cops”,
he said.

47:07.958 --> 47:12.247
Furthermore, he saw no sign
of a high-powered motorcycle.

47:13.250 --> 47:15.707
How do you explain that?
=I don't.

47:15.875 --> 47:17.740
The motorcycle was there when I left.

47:18.042 --> 47:21.534
Can you explain why a friend
who went for a social call

47:21.542 --> 47:23.498
would race away like that?

47:24.083 --> 47:26.495
I didn't race away.

47:26.500 --> 47:30.322
I got into the car, put on a song,
and drove off slowly,

47:30.833 --> 47:32.243
then accelerated.

47:32.542 --> 47:34.703
But that man disagrees.

47:34.708 --> 47:37.950
He even specified
what time you raced away.

47:37.958 --> 47:41.450
I was listening to the outro
for news1 on my car radio.

47:42.292 --> 47:45.125
News1 that morning ended at 8:10,

47:45.958 --> 47:49.030
8:10, not 10 to 8:00.

47:49.667 --> 47:52.283
Those 20 minutes make a big difference.

47:52.792 --> 47:54.953
So you lied to us twice:

47:54.958 --> 47:57.199
About the motorcyclist

47:57.208 --> 47:59.790
and the time you left the crime scene.

48:00.417 --> 48:04.410
Because you left the villa
after judge mastropaolo died!

48:04.417 --> 48:06.248
Or rather, after you killed him.

48:08.708 --> 48:11.780
Judge castellano,
these insinuations are inadmissible.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.616
My client will not answer that point.

48:14.625 --> 48:17.947
We'll take the time necessary
to analyze

48:17.958 --> 48:20.324
the material...
The probative material, okay.

48:21.042 --> 48:23.203
Very well, before going,

48:23.208 --> 48:27.121
tell us why you went
to the bari airport last night.

48:29.208 --> 48:31.790
This report from investigators says

48:31.792 --> 48:36.456
after you drove your daughter home,
you went to bari airport

48:36.625 --> 48:39.332
and stayed at arrivals for 15 minutes.

48:39.333 --> 48:41.244
Expecting someone? = no.

48:41.583 --> 48:45.280
In fact, you left alone.
Then why did you go?

48:46.833 --> 48:49.165
To make a call. = a call?

48:50.417 --> 48:54.114
Tell us why you'd go make a call
at the airport late at night

48:54.125 --> 48:57.037
instead of using
your cell or home phone?

49:02.500 --> 49:03.910
You won't tell us?

49:50.500 --> 49:51.831
How are you?

49:52.917 --> 49:54.953
Martina?

49:54.958 --> 49:57.074
She wants to come see you. = no.

49:57.083 --> 50:00.041
- Why?
- I don't want her to see me like this.

50:01.167 --> 50:04.239
I'll get out soon anyway.
=-you don't know that.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.992
Yes, I do. I didn't do anything,
I'm innocent.

50:08.458 --> 50:10.619
Everything will be fine.

50:14.958 --> 50:17.950
Hello, deputy prencipe.
Did you call me?

50:20.750 --> 50:22.536
Hey. = hi.

50:22.542 --> 50:24.453
Since you weren't going home,

50:24.458 --> 50:28.121
I swapped shifts with a co-worker
who asked me.

50:28.125 --> 50:30.537
- And martina?
- She's with my mom.

50:33.042 --> 50:35.909
Here for the investigation?
= yes.

50:39.208 --> 50:42.371
This evening a girl had an accident,
her name's Beatrice.

50:43.250 --> 50:47.994
Before going under
she gave us your number. Who is she?

50:49.292 --> 50:52.034
An escort, she's our informant.

50:54.167 --> 50:57.614
I asked whose number it was,
she said "my honey's".

50:58.417 --> 51:01.580
- What?
- And you've been together for 3 years.

51:01.583 --> 51:03.539
You want a baby together...

51:05.583 --> 51:07.699
And you don't love your wife.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.822
Honey, she's a junkie.
She makes things up.

51:11.833 --> 51:15.826
- And why would she?
- Who knows, to upset you.

51:16.250 --> 51:18.616
But she doesn't know I'm your wife.

51:22.583 --> 51:24.790
Are those for me?

51:30.292 --> 51:32.408
Who did it?

51:34.500 --> 51:37.333
I don't know,
I can't figure it out.

51:38.667 --> 51:40.623
There must be traces.

51:41.625 --> 51:45.538
There was a picture of me on his desk.

51:46.792 --> 51:49.989
I don't recall where it's from
but it's missing.

51:51.333 --> 51:53.745
What do you mean, missing?

51:54.583 --> 51:56.119
The killer must've taken it.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.868
- Why?
- Because he knows me and hates me.

52:04.375 --> 52:07.947
This whole story seems so crazy.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.865
Any news on the motorcycle?

52:17.833 --> 52:19.915
Don't get used to it!

52:29.125 --> 52:31.867
"Son of fugitive killed.
Killer fled on red motorcycle"

52:39.208 --> 52:40.744
I want pirrone.

52:40.750 --> 52:44.322
I don't care about the others,
just get him.

52:44.333 --> 52:48.030
- Who told you he's here?
- Don't worry, a reliable source.

52:49.333 --> 52:52.325
- We're not prepared.
- There's nothing to prepare.

52:52.333 --> 52:57.032
You've done it a thousand times:
Go in and bring him to hq alive.

52:58.625 --> 53:00.581
All right.

53:26.417 --> 53:27.452
It's empty!

53:30.667 --> 53:32.077
Impossible!

53:32.458 --> 53:34.198
See for yourself, it's empty.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.536
Then there's a spy...

53:39.542 --> 53:42.499
- Guess your source was...
- There must be a spy!

53:42.500 --> 53:44.866
And we're all in danger, all of us!

54:49.500 --> 54:52.162
- The attorney isn't coming.
- What?

54:52.583 --> 54:55.199
We were talking and he hung up.

54:56.417 --> 54:58.203
Fine, we can postpone.

54:58.958 --> 55:00.573
No, let's do it.

55:00.833 --> 55:03.905
We need to wrap up this situation.

55:03.917 --> 55:07.205
Confess. 15 years,
10 with good conduct.

55:07.958 --> 55:09.823
Out in time for your daughter's wedding.

55:10.417 --> 55:12.453
A fit of rage.

55:12.458 --> 55:14.665
So we eliminate premeditation.

55:16.958 --> 55:19.119
You wouldn't say this to someone else.

55:20.625 --> 55:25.870
When you insinuated I was the spy,
the mafia's informer,

55:25.875 --> 55:28.617
I didn't cause a stink
or accuse you.

55:28.625 --> 55:30.536
I just defended myself.

55:30.542 --> 55:33.909
I'm not settling the score, francesco.
Facts are your rivals, not me.

55:34.792 --> 55:37.499
And facts say that you killed
judge mastropaolo.

55:40.083 --> 55:43.120
You're funny when you act like
inspector montalbano.

55:44.125 --> 55:47.788
You've studied too much, Michele.
This is life, not an exam.

55:48.458 --> 55:51.825
I know all about life.
Especially yours.

55:51.833 --> 55:55.451
Luxury, women...
Or should I say young girls?

55:56.208 --> 56:00.156
Nice cars, overseas trips, gambling.

56:02.083 --> 56:06.372
We have the same salary,
but I can't afford 1/10 of these vices.

56:07.958 --> 56:11.871
That's the problem, I've never
paid to sleep with a woman.

56:12.292 --> 56:14.954
Remember Miriam and federica
from police academy?

56:15.625 --> 56:18.082
You were nuts about them both.

56:18.083 --> 56:22.577
And when I slept with them both,
how did you react?

56:23.042 --> 56:26.409
You mention my cars?
I've always bought used cars.

56:26.417 --> 56:29.739
Trips? Last minute, half price.

56:29.750 --> 56:31.991
Gambling is a vice, yes.

56:32.167 --> 56:34.749
I've lost, but I've won more.

56:34.750 --> 56:36.706
So what are we talking about?

56:38.792 --> 56:41.124
Are you a cop or not? =I am.

56:41.917 --> 56:45.580
Then find some evidence
instead of indulging your views.

56:45.875 --> 56:47.706
You've always followed one lead.

56:47.958 --> 56:50.950
But you should investigate
everyone's lives, corroborate.

56:51.125 --> 56:52.490
We have!

56:52.500 --> 56:56.197
We spoke to associates, informers,
relatives, friends.

56:56.208 --> 56:59.530
Even his American ex.
But nothing, no black hole.

56:59.542 --> 57:03.956
The most reliable informers are sure
the mafia isn't behind this murder.

57:03.958 --> 57:06.870
They say it was a Maverick
who acted alone,

57:06.875 --> 57:09.947
with no clan logic,
to settle his own score.

57:09.958 --> 57:13.826
Find the motorcyclist then.
Look for tire marks in the driveway.

57:13.833 --> 57:16.119
- We're looking into it.
- Looking into it?

57:16.917 --> 57:20.956
I'm in jail for no reason
and you're looking into it?

57:20.958 --> 57:24.121
There was an article in the paper...
=l read it.

57:24.125 --> 57:26.161
- And?
- They're investigating.

57:26.167 --> 57:29.204
Expect me to question
every red motorcycle owner in Italy?

57:29.833 --> 57:33.155
If you want the truth, yes.
= see...

57:33.917 --> 57:36.579
A fit of rage and...

57:37.958 --> 57:39.823
You shot him.

57:41.625 --> 57:43.786
Take my advice, francesco, confess.

57:46.792 --> 57:49.329
Are you fucking maralfa?

57:51.292 --> 57:53.032
With that trendy beard...

57:53.417 --> 57:55.749
But in bed, she is the slave.

58:12.250 --> 58:15.287
Does the professor agree
with your line of defense?

58:16.667 --> 58:20.535
The old man at the airport told us
you spoke to a certain "professor",

58:20.917 --> 58:24.205
and used a deferential tone
as if intimidated.

58:25.458 --> 58:29.076
Since I've known you,
I've never seen you be intimidated

58:29.083 --> 58:33.782
so who could this professor be
and why are you afraid of him?

58:36.042 --> 58:38.579
He must've heard wrong.

58:38.583 --> 58:40.369
Probably deaf at his age.

01:00:00.375 --> 01:00:02.286
I am not a killer.

01:00:49.833 --> 01:00:51.869
You swore.

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:56.287
You're not a liar, you're worse.

01:00:57.208 --> 01:00:58.914
You make things up.

01:00:58.917 --> 01:01:00.828
You make up lives...

01:01:01.292 --> 01:01:03.658
Honest, dishonest, cowardly ones...

01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:07.120
Upright, exemplary, disgusting ones...

01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:10.581
And then we just erase it.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.162
We forget it all. New lives!

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:16.994
But it doesn't work like that.

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.490
It doesn't.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.787
I was dripping in sweat.
= me too.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.824
So, are you leaving?

01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:56.540
Want me to stay?

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.412
Is this what you call male loyalty?

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:13.533
You think you understand everything.

01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:15.954
Investigations, hearings...

01:02:16.417 --> 01:02:19.534
A world of kids, good and bad ones.

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:23.242
Heroes of nothing,
the two of you.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:26.373
The loneliest of all.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.536
Boss!

01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:43.700
- I don't know how to play.
- Come here.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.206
Come on.

01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:57.748
How's it going, boss?

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.456
- Not well.
- You should be well.

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:03.416
Your trial starts tomorrow,
get pumped.

01:03:05.583 --> 01:03:07.915
Read the papers carefully.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.706
What do you know?

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:18.783
What do you think?

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:21.204
I think you're afraid of freedom.

01:03:21.542 --> 01:03:24.739
In here you eat, sleep,
drink without hassle.

01:03:26.292 --> 01:03:29.580
But out there someone
might run you over on the street,

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:31.949
maybe a red motorcycle.

01:03:33.167 --> 01:03:35.829
Wake up! Or you'll end up badly.

01:03:39.792 --> 01:03:42.499
What if he killed himself?

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:45.240
Who got rid of the gun?

01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:48.032
You.

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:52.155
You respected him so much
you didn't want the news to get out.

01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:54.624
So you threw the gun in the sea

01:03:54.625 --> 01:03:57.332
and risked being blamed for it.

01:03:58.208 --> 01:04:00.699
Giorgio, get some rest.

01:04:00.917 --> 01:04:04.034
The trial's tomorrow,
you need to be sharp.

01:04:07.792 --> 01:04:09.828
- You don't trust me.
- Nonsense.

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:12.499
You don't trust me!

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.661
How can I trust you?

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:18.865
Where were you when I called
this morning? Out stalking?

01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:26.664
From belluno?

01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:29.704
Yes, after university
a friend found me a job here.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:32.996
She was even
a biathlon champ in '95/'96.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.831
Alberto tomba gave her a prize.

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:37.620
- How do you know?
- How do I know?

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:41.538
I know everything about you.
And I'd like to get to know more.

01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:43.740
Giorgio!

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.615
I'm kidding.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.911
- Take it easy.
- What?

01:04:48.917 --> 01:04:51.033
Are you judging me, your honor?

01:04:51.042 --> 01:04:53.829
I'm totally sober,
for your information.

01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:56.370
I'll get more prosecco.

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:58.289
I'll come too.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.367
Everything's fine, okay?
Stay calm, giorgio.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:05.207
Can I talk to you? =huh?

01:05:05.208 --> 01:05:07.164
I have something important to tell you.

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:10.125
Can't we hear this
important thing?

01:05:12.083 --> 01:05:14.074
Hey, Alice!

01:05:14.083 --> 01:05:15.869
Leave her alone.

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.991
- Let go.
- Calm down.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:23.328
Are you insane?

01:05:30.417 --> 01:05:33.659
You need to knock it off!
You're a pain in the ass!

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:36.494
She's not into you.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.866
She's the woman of my dreams.

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:40.786
No, she doesn't want you.

01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:44.829
Then why'd she come tonight?

01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:47.449
Why did she come tonight?

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:50.700
Giovanni asked her to come.
= dumb-ass...

01:05:51.542 --> 01:05:54.739
You don't understand
how to approach things.

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:57.620
All you think about is you. Always you.

01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:01.374
You don't even know who
your real friends are.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.582
If I were in your place,

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:16.784
I'd absolve francesco prencipe.

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:18.744
Too many doubts.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:20.490
Many clues, yes,

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:24.162
but... I'd think...

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:25.657
No evidence.

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:30.742
I wouldn't feel right locking up

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:33.412
a respected law official.

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:37.830
I wouldn't have the nerve
to listen to my conscience,

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:40.449
to the voice of truth,

01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:42.494
to judge mastropaolo's cry.

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:45.457
I'd be afraid to err.

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:47.994
But I know my nature,

01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:51.530
and I often tend to shirk
personal responsibilities,

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:54.578
those that should be faced.

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:56.866
All of the evidence

01:06:56.875 --> 01:07:02.415
demonstrates the defendant
was the only person at the crime scene

01:07:02.417 --> 01:07:04.453
when the murder took place.

01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:08.743
His prints were the only ones
found in the victim's villa.

01:07:09.042 --> 01:07:12.955
And it was him who was seen
fleeing right after the murder

01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:15.870
with the speed of someone fleeing
from a nightmare.

01:07:17.625 --> 01:07:20.492
The defendant has no alibi,

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.413
he lied about the timeframe,

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:27.614
about the reason
he went to see the victim,

01:07:27.625 --> 01:07:30.332
and about the state
of their relationship,

01:07:30.917 --> 01:07:36.082
when the motive for this crime
is to be found in that very relationship.

01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:42.075
He even tried to unload responsibility

01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:44.244
on a mysterious motorcyclist

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:47.788
whom there's no trace of,
if not in his imagination.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.288
This in itself, I'd think if I were you,
wrongly,

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:55.905
doesn't make francesco prencipe a killer.

01:07:56.917 --> 01:08:00.080
But I am weak, I admit it.

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:02.745
In a trial like this,

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:05.287
there is ho room for weakness.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:10.372
You will know how to give due weight
to these truths.

01:08:11.542 --> 01:08:13.908
And in doing so perhaps

01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:16.624
you'll think about
judge Giovanni mastropaolo,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.082
who knew he had many enemies,

01:08:20.082 --> 01:08:22.620
but never suspected
the most dangerous one

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:25.162
lurked within that man
he considered his brother.

01:08:26.292 --> 01:08:29.955
That is why I am asking for
the maximum penalty:

01:08:29.957 --> 01:08:32.243
Life sentence.

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:44.618
Hold on...

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:53.029
What's in that drawer?

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.116
What? Jewelry, a weapon?

01:08:56.125 --> 01:08:58.787
What? Poison?

01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:03.787
When you get the key
go open it and see.

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.035
May I?

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:09.205
You may. But you'll break our pact.

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:13.707
Pal, the devil exists.

01:09:13.707 --> 01:09:15.868
Don't you forget that.

01:09:17.917 --> 01:09:20.033
Run, shithead.

01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:22.033
Run!

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:25.956
Come on!

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:29.624
Mr. greco,
do you swear to tell the truth,

01:09:29.625 --> 01:09:31.911
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.535
Yes.

01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:38.286
As requested by the da, the witness
will be examined by the public prosecutor.

01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:43.996
Mr. greco,
did you know judge mastropaolo?

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:46.660
No.

01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:50.158
May I ask why you were there
that day?

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:54.203
I was picking fruit.

01:09:54.207 --> 01:09:58.622
Your honor, is oronzo greco
that man or the man next to him?

01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:02.705
Attorney annichiarico,
"the man next to him" as you said,

01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:07.869
is an interpreter legitimately
requested by the public prosecutor.

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:13.081
As I explained, Mr. greco
has been a farmer all of his life,

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:16.496
and he isn't ashamed to admit
his Italian isn't perfect.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.994
Hence, "the man next to him"
translates his apulian dialect

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.366
so that we can understand him clearly.

01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:26.290
Do you have an objection to this?

01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:29.034
- No objection, your honor.
- Good.

01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:30.202
Carry on.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:35.415
So Mr. greco, that day
you were picking cactus fruit.

01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:37.203
What did you see?

01:10:40.792 --> 01:10:43.704
The car raced off
and kicked up dust.

01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:48.448
Can you tell us
which car you saw race off?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.490
Number three.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:55.950
Three. The defendant's car,

01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:58.745
a Mercedes glc 220.

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.788
Can you tell us what time you saw
the car race off?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.697
Your honor,
he should understand that, no?

01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:09.287
Sit down, attorney.

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:12.994
The radio music was on.

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:16.951
Can you be more precise?
What music? What radio?

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:19.912
The music that plays
at the end of news1.

01:11:19.917 --> 01:11:24.286
You mean the news1 outro?
And where did you hear it?

01:11:25.792 --> 01:11:28.124
In my car on the radio.

01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:30.536
He's putting words in his mouth.

01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:32.533
How can you be so sure?

01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:35.782
I listen to it every day.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:38.578
Could you be mistaken?

01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:41.289
No.

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:43.699
As you can see on the printouts,

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:49.499
the outro for news1 on October 27, 2018
ended precisely at 8:10.

01:11:50.417 --> 01:11:53.204
Mr. greco, do you clearly remember

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:57.827
where car number 3 was parked?

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.615
By the entrance of the house.

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:03.241
So you saw that the car

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:06.697
was parked and then it drove off?

01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:10.324
- Yes.
- Did it drive off fast or slow?

01:12:11.458 --> 01:12:12.914
Like lightning.

01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:15.408
One last question, Mr. greco:

01:12:15.417 --> 01:12:19.706
Did you see a motorcycle parked
near the defendant's car?

01:12:20.042 --> 01:12:21.452
A red motorcycle.

01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:25.204
- No.
- You didn't? Are you sure?

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:28.032
Yes.

01:12:28.667 --> 01:12:30.999
Thank you very much, Mr. greco.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.331
That's all, your honor.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.164
Listen...

01:13:25.542 --> 01:13:27.498
Give this to the professor.

01:13:51.625 --> 01:13:55.038
Don't be late for lunch,
they're serving delicious cactus fruit.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.163
Weapon: A 9 mm gun
that was never found.

01:14:04.167 --> 01:14:05.782
So no prints.

01:14:05.792 --> 01:14:09.284
Investigation verified that no shot
was fired from your service gun

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:13.331
and the swab was negative,
there's no proof you held a gun.

01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:17.405
You could've wiped down the gun
but it's not your fault,

01:14:17.417 --> 01:14:20.614
if monno is so dumb that
he waited 24 hours to test the weapon.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:25.406
Motive: A murder without motive
is simply not plausible.

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:28.864
We're not talking about a psychopath,
and there's no motive.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.618
Giovanni's co-workers' speculation about
your strained friendship is just drivel.

01:14:34.458 --> 01:14:38.280
Your prints: You were in Giovanni's home
the morning he was killed,

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:39.828
you never denied that.

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:41.949
It's unlikely someone waited
for you to leave,

01:14:41.958 --> 01:14:46.156
went in to kill him,
wiped their prints, and ran off.

01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:49.871
Then there's
the mysterious airport call:

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:54.665
An anonymous call to
an anonymous person you won't name.

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:58.990
Maralfa is playing this up
and it did influence the jury.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.663
There are tons of reasons
why a man remains tight-lipped:

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:04.494
You called a young lover,

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.072
or a doctor about an illness
you don't want people to know about...

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:11.701
Can't a person make a call
without having to explain it?

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:16.656
Based on these elements,
no judge can condemn you.

01:15:17.042 --> 01:15:18.703
But they will.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.697
They'll condemn you due to
an old farmer's testimony

01:15:23.708 --> 01:15:27.155
since he has "honest"
written on his forehead.

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:30.699
I thought about it all night.

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:34.155
The problem isn't that
he saw you leave at 8:10,

01:15:34.167 --> 01:15:38.160
no jury would give life in prison
for such an uncertain element

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:41.330
like the exact time of death.

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:44.040
That old man called you a liar.

01:15:44.042 --> 01:15:46.499
And if you are a liar...

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:49.700
Ol-al.

01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:54.494
Remember?

01:15:55.625 --> 01:15:59.322
Applied criminal procedure class
with professor storelli,

01:15:59.333 --> 01:16:03.030
he had a bush of white hair,
like Einstein,

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:05.829
we could barely understand his words.

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:07.414
Know his theory?

01:16:08.042 --> 01:16:09.042
No.

01:16:09.542 --> 01:16:15.037
He said the judge and defendant
almost have a romantic relationship.

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:18.705
If he finds out you lied,
he'll act like a man scorned

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:21.620
even if it's a white lie
and the rest is true.

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:26.119
From then on it's ol-al.:
One lie, all lies.

01:16:30.292 --> 01:16:33.830
- So according to this Einstein, I am...
- Totally screwed.

01:16:33.833 --> 01:16:36.290
But this theory
applies to witnesses too.

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:38.499
Especially to witnesses,

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.698
who by law must tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.

01:16:42.708 --> 01:16:45.666
If the witness tells one lie,
they lose credibility.

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:49.660
Even if it's an old man
with "honest" written on his forehead.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:53.707
And what would this lie be?

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:56.615
What would this lie be?

01:16:57.292 --> 01:16:59.203
Dunno.

01:16:59.792 --> 01:17:03.910
But tomorrow I'm going to the villa
because I have a hunch,

01:17:03.917 --> 01:17:07.956
something tells me there's a gap
in that old man's testimony.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.539
- Youup toit?
- Yes.

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:14.909
Then I'll find a substitute
for tomorrow, it's essential.

01:17:15.667 --> 01:17:16.907
Let's review.

01:17:17.542 --> 01:17:20.534
I wanted to say that...

01:17:20.542 --> 01:17:25.457
It's absurd to think a man
would take his best friend's life,

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:30.831
that the victim would call his killer
to kill him,

01:17:32.042 --> 01:17:34.078
that he'd kill without motive,

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:40.328
that a law-abiding man is blamed
instead of any other criminal.

01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:43.870
It's absurd that a police officer

01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:49.327
would commit a murder when everyone
knew he was at the crime scene,

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:54.739
that an expert investigator

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:59.414
would leave the scene of the crime
without wiping his prints

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:07.204
and would make up a story
about a red motorcycle with no proof.

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:17.033
It's absurd that
a law enforcer like me,

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:23.328
who for 20 years fought against
every sort of criminal,

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.741
would suddenly

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.786
become a ruthless killer.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.081
It's all so absurd.

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:37.158
And more than anything,

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:40.741
I have to say

01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:49.745
It's absurd that I'm even here.

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:54.790
The trial
against francesco prencipe...

01:19:54.792 --> 01:19:56.748
I can't do it with a ring on...

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.913
Main suspect
in the murder of Giovanni mastropaolo...

01:19:59.917 --> 01:20:01.828
See you Tuesday?

01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:05.405
The judge killed in his home
in nardo in October

01:20:05.417 --> 01:20:06.873
is winding up.

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:09.457
They had reached closing arguments

01:20:09.458 --> 01:20:14.578
but the defense asked for additional
investigations which the judge approved.

01:20:14.583 --> 01:20:17.871
There's been no official statement
from the public prosecutor.

01:20:42.125 --> 01:20:43.831
What are you doing?

01:20:46.167 --> 01:20:48.579
Reading dad's old school books?

01:20:49.458 --> 01:20:51.790
Did he give his statement?

01:20:53.208 --> 01:20:55.119
What did he say?

01:20:56.375 --> 01:20:59.447
That he and Giovanni
were lucky to have met.

01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:02.533
That they had a great friendship.

01:21:02.542 --> 01:21:04.874
Friendship doesn't exist.

01:21:04.875 --> 01:21:06.786
We all want something from someone

01:21:06.792 --> 01:21:09.283
and whoever gives it to you
is a friend.

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:13.080
- Giovanni wanted nothing from your dad.
- Yes, he did.

01:21:13.625 --> 01:21:17.914
Like all gods who need a cupbearer
to feel omnipotent.

01:21:24.208 --> 01:21:26.290
Do you still love dad?

01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:37.873
Bailiff, let the witness in.

01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:54.955
Your honor, may I show
the witness a photo?

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:59.205
I object. The photo was not
entered as trial evidence.

01:21:59.208 --> 01:22:03.030
It's a photo taken yesterday
of the bay of Santa caterina.

01:22:03.042 --> 01:22:06.955
I'd like the witness to show me
the places he mentioned in his testimony.

01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:08.615
Objection overruled.

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:11.082
- Attorney, get to the point.
- Thank you.

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:18.539
Mr. greco,

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:26.201
this is the view from the driveway
of judge mastropaolo's villa.

01:22:26.792 --> 01:22:28.657
Please show me, Mr. greco,

01:22:29.792 --> 01:22:35.082
where the cactus you were picking
fruit from on October 27th is.

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:39.449
Where is the plant?

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:46.157
Here?

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:49.786
This is the plant? This one.

01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:56.203
This is the same plant,
but seen from behind.

01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:57.573
The same plant.

01:22:57.583 --> 01:23:00.541
We see the driveway
in front of the victim's villa.

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:03.116
Is it the same plant, Mr. greco?

01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:08.663
- Yes.
- The same you picked fruit from?

01:23:11.125 --> 01:23:15.323
So it's the same plant from where
you saw the defendant's car race off?

01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:19.499
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:21.115
Good.

01:23:21.125 --> 01:23:23.707
Because you see, Mr. greco,

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.994
this plant doesn't grow fruit.

01:23:35.083 --> 01:23:37.369
I have the report

01:23:38.792 --> 01:23:40.703
of an esteemed botanist

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:44.872
who has already worked
with public prosecutor's office

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:47.867
and with Ms. maralfa herself on one case.

01:23:48.083 --> 01:23:50.745
The report says,
please excuse my ignorance,

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:54.117
that this plant grows in terrain
that is too rich

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:56.036
in "vermicompost".

01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:58.206
Furthermore, despite its dimensions,

01:23:58.208 --> 01:24:02.201
the plant is too young to bear fruit,
it doesn't even have blossoms.

01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:10.242
But there's another cactus
that bears red, juicy fruit

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:12.957
oh that same hill.

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.708
Let me show it to you.

01:24:18.583 --> 01:24:22.747
This is the only other cactus
ohn that hill.

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:25.032
Mr. greco, forgive me,

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:28.239
I don't want to put words in your mouth
or pressure you,

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:31.538
but could this be the cactus

01:24:31.542 --> 01:24:34.454
you picked fruit from
on October 27th?

01:24:40.292 --> 01:24:43.329
- Yes.
- So you were mistaken before?

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:49.789
I think so, too.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.036
I have one last photo to show you,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.916
it shows judge mastropaolo's villa
from the cactus in question.

01:25:00.917 --> 01:25:03.454
Take a look, jury, your honor.

01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:09.872
As you can see, from this spot
it is impossible,

01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:13.329
impossible to see the villa's driveway.

01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:25.331
Silence.

01:25:26.875 --> 01:25:28.615
Ol-al.

01:25:28.625 --> 01:25:32.072
Mr. greco, if,
as you yourself admitted,

01:25:32.542 --> 01:25:35.124
you were wrong about the cactus,

01:25:35.125 --> 01:25:38.788
perhaps you were also wrong
about the defendant's car.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:41.783
And in regards to the time of day,

01:25:41.792 --> 01:25:45.660
maybe your mind deceived you
and you didn't hear the new1 outro

01:25:45.667 --> 01:25:47.908
while the defendant's car passed by?

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:52.243
Since you couldn't see the driveway
from where you were,

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:57.825
how can you state there was
no red motorcycle there that morning?

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:03.657
That's all, your honor.

01:26:03.833 --> 01:26:05.949
Ma'am, any questions for the witness?

01:26:07.958 --> 01:26:09.914
Ma'am?

01:26:09.917 --> 01:26:13.159
Mr. greco, you are under oath,
you must tell the truth.

01:26:13.458 --> 01:26:14.948
Silence!

01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:18.121
Do you realize
you could be charged with perjury?

01:26:18.292 --> 01:26:21.830
Ma'am, it's not your place to admonish
the witness. Ask your question.

01:26:21.833 --> 01:26:23.915
No further questions.

01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:42.748
Come in.

01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.324
When's the verdict?

01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:14.573
Tomorrow.

01:27:17.542 --> 01:27:22.707
No journalists allowed inside,
no one authorized to watch the trial.

01:27:22.708 --> 01:27:25.074
- Is that you?
- Who?

01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:28.701
Cross-examination of the key witness
by the defense has ended.

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:31.950
My goodness, attorney,
it's my treat!

01:27:33.917 --> 01:27:36.989
"Il finally start looking for you
by stopping to.

01:27:37.458 --> 01:27:39.323
Never again.

01:27:39.333 --> 01:27:41.699
A few words and you walk with me

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:46.998
alongside my nostalgia.

01:27:48.875 --> 01:27:51.241
And I've never loved you as much...

01:27:52.083 --> 01:27:53.118
Wonderful.

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:57.118
We still don't know
the content of this testimony

01:27:57.125 --> 01:27:59.741
which is crucial
to the trial's outcome.

01:28:12.792 --> 01:28:14.748
Rosso antico, please.

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.706
Another.

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.782
In the name of the Italian people,

01:29:09.792 --> 01:29:14.491
bari's court of assizes, based on
article 530 of the criminal code,

01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:19.702
acquits francesco prencipe
of the crime, grounds withheld.

01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:21.448
Court is adjourned.

01:29:37.083 --> 01:29:38.869
I wasn't sure you'd shake.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:41.574
Do you think you're that important?

01:29:42.042 --> 01:29:44.749
See you at the appeal.
=I doubt it.

01:29:45.708 --> 01:29:48.290
I'll read the grounds
and talk to the da,

01:29:48.292 --> 01:29:51.034
but I have no intention of appealing.

01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:55.869
You see, if you're innocent,

01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:59.663
then justice has been served
and we should all be glad.

01:29:59.667 --> 01:30:00.998
But if you're guilty...

01:30:05.292 --> 01:30:09.080
But seeing how things went,
I see no probability.

01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:12.619
Don't be so smug, it's beneath you.

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:17.242
Know what a great judge used to say?

01:30:17.833 --> 01:30:21.121
In the end, this courtroom
is just the latrine of passions.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.865
Take care.

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:32.492
"That description is wrong”
she says.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.822
"If she did what she's accused of,
she's an Oscar-winning actress".

01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:38.825
"She's not acting”, I say.

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.449
"She really believes she's innocent".

01:30:44.667 --> 01:30:46.703
Be careful,

01:30:47.167 --> 01:30:50.330
because with this downfall of conscience,

01:30:50.333 --> 01:30:52.415
anyone, even loved ones,

01:30:52.417 --> 01:30:55.534
could do things
they never expected to do.

01:31:29.542 --> 01:31:31.624
Why me?

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:37.992
I'm a mediocre attorney, I drink,
I'm unreliable.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.492
Why did you want me?
= that's not true.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:44.822
You're a great attorney
and you just proved it.

01:31:47.583 --> 01:31:50.165
This was sent to me
after greco's deposition.

01:31:51.125 --> 01:31:53.332
It's not signed.

01:31:53.333 --> 01:31:55.870
It says to go to the villa
and examine the cactus.

01:31:58.625 --> 01:32:01.287
Someone else saved you.

01:32:01.708 --> 01:32:03.744
You just needed a faithful dog

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:06.287
who'd bring back the stick
after you tossed it.

01:32:09.208 --> 01:32:11.290
I don't believe you.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.956
I don't think you hate your life.

01:32:16.333 --> 01:32:20.201
You chose to be who you are.
Even worse than a killer.

01:32:24.083 --> 01:32:27.041
And you fucked Alice, too.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.616
She called me
when she heard I cleared you.

01:32:33.542 --> 01:32:37.034
I'd been waiting forever to see
her name on my phone.

01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:40.081
She said I'm a dumb-ass...

01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:49.242
You went to her house for
a so-called search 9 years ago and...

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.833
There in the entryway...
Oh the credenza...

01:32:56.833 --> 01:32:58.698
Is it true?

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:01.994
You're sick.

01:33:02.708 --> 01:33:04.949
You're still 8 years old,

01:33:04.958 --> 01:33:09.907
like when your father left
and you dreamt of being an opera singer.

01:33:11.792 --> 01:33:15.580
You made up this love
to help you live,

01:33:16.917 --> 01:33:19.579
but even if she came
knocking on your door

01:33:19.583 --> 01:33:22.416
you wouldn't let her in, know why?

01:33:22.417 --> 01:33:24.373
Because you'd have to change,

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:29.832
stop going out at night at 4:00 am
being pitied by bartenders,

01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:33.662
stop thinking you're a poet
when you're a drunk,

01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:38.872
stop dreaming you could've graced
important stages

01:33:38.875 --> 01:33:40.866
when you don't have the voice.

01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:48.697
You should be a partner for her
but let's get real,

01:33:49.542 --> 01:33:51.908
you wouldn't be capable of it.

01:33:53.833 --> 01:33:55.949
You're the sick one.

01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:01.161
All you want to do is possess.

01:34:01.583 --> 01:34:03.790
Even things you don't like, in fact,

01:34:03.792 --> 01:34:06.579
that's what you like most.

01:34:18.542 --> 01:34:20.282
And I have a great voice.

01:34:43.042 --> 01:34:44.623
Where are we going?

01:35:01.625 --> 01:35:04.458
And these are my wishes:

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:08.370
The family villa in
Santa caterina di nardo...

01:35:21.792 --> 01:35:23.828
What's the best part of your job?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.366
When I realize the defendant's innocent.

01:37:00.417 --> 01:37:02.408
Professor, it's prencipe.

01:37:15.875 --> 01:37:17.490
Nice to meet you.

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:22.201
The professor suggests
you disappear for a while.

01:37:23.792 --> 01:37:25.202
How long?

01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:31.248
As long as you would've been in jail
if we hadn't saved you.

01:37:33.708 --> 01:37:35.198
You'll leave tomorrow.

01:37:48.375 --> 01:37:50.957
Do I look like a kid? Good.

01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:53.241
'Cause this is what will keep us united.

01:37:54.167 --> 01:37:57.830
There's a hidden drawer in the desk
that belonged to my father.

01:37:57.833 --> 01:38:02.532
On the bottom right-hand side, hidden
by a panel just like the other side.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.413
But this one can be removed,
you just need to press it.

01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:10.457
It's the only one, there are no copies.

01:38:11.083 --> 01:38:14.371
Take it and hand it off
to each other often.

01:38:14.708 --> 01:38:16.414
Never tell me who has it.

01:38:16.833 --> 01:38:18.323
Why?

01:38:18.333 --> 01:38:21.040
Or I'll be tempted to open the drawer

01:38:21.333 --> 01:38:23.244
and take out what I put inside.

01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:25.286
What you put inside is yours.

01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:28.241
No, it's ours now.

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.616
And nobody must ever touch it.

01:38:30.625 --> 01:38:31.910
What is it?

01:38:31.917 --> 01:38:34.408
That drawer must never be opened.

01:38:34.833 --> 01:38:38.496
That's our pact, forever.

01:39:20.375 --> 01:39:23.867
“Judicial seizure of property.

"Il grievously conclude that dep. Prencipe
has been conspiring with the mafia."

01:44:02.542 --> 01:44:05.909

01:44:35.917 --> 01:44:38.124
