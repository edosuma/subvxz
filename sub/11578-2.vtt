ÀÚ¸·Á¦ÀÛ - NSC ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ
(http://club.nate.com/tsm)

00:23.205 --> 00:25.015
In the criminal justice system,

00:25.015 --> 00:28.794
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:28.794 --> 00:29.986
In New York City,

00:29.986 --> 00:33.543
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.543 --> 00:36.550
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.712
These are their stories.

00:40.325 --> 00:44.062
I found her moaning, half-naked,
bleeding from her chest and privates.

00:44.062 --> 00:46.441
Couldn't tell her age.
Her face was too badly beaten.

00:46.441 --> 00:48.206
She moan anything
you could make out?

00:48.206 --> 00:49.511
Nothing that sounded like words.

00:49.511 --> 00:51.785
We got this call 45 minutes ago.
Why is she still here?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.195
They've only been here five minutes.

00:53.195 --> 00:55.692
Moses wasn't available to
part the morning rush hour.

00:55.692 --> 00:57.352
Deep stab wound, left chest.

00:57.352 --> 00:59.300
- Hand me a 4 by 4.
- I was afraid to move her.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.845
I called for the bus, I put a rush on it.

01:00.845 --> 01:01.753
What have we got?

01:01.753 --> 01:03.660
Good old-fashioned stoning,
New York style.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.534
My guess, after the stabbing and rape.

01:05.534 --> 01:06.431
What about the weapon?

01:06.431 --> 01:07.889
- Nothing yet.
- Any ID?

01:07.889 --> 01:08.975
Still looking.

01:08.975 --> 01:10.863
BP 90 over 60.
That's as good as we're gonna get.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.883
Let's get her out of here.

01:14.798 --> 01:16.481
What is this, open season?

01:16.481 --> 01:17.919
A few drinks, a little smoke,

01:17.919 --> 01:20.141
a bunch of guys
wet down a couple dozen women?

01:20.141 --> 01:22.526
- Wilding's back in vogue.
- I hate that word "wilding."

01:22.526 --> 01:24.394
Like it's some kind of party.

01:24.394 --> 01:26.828
You ride, I'll cover the scene?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/10/27

02:19.928 --> 02:22.616
Is there anything
I can tell the chief of detectives

02:22.616 --> 02:24.124
when he calls me for the fifth time?

02:24.124 --> 02:26.653
Female Jane Doe, probably in her 20s.

02:26.653 --> 02:30.713
She was raped, stabbed,
and beaten with stones. Left for dead.

02:30.713 --> 02:32.010
No clue who she is?

02:32.010 --> 02:34.053
We grid-searched,
put divers in the pond.

02:34.053 --> 02:36.069
The scene was pretty much trampled.

02:36.069 --> 02:38.763
It could have been a dump job.
No ID, no knife.

02:38.763 --> 02:39.687
I rode the bus with her.

02:39.687 --> 02:42.015
She was mumbling something
in Arabic or Hebrew.

02:42.015 --> 02:44.085
Nothing that I could make out.

02:44.367 --> 02:45.192
Thanks.

02:45.192 --> 02:47.913
That was the hospital.
They got post-op photos for us.

02:47.913 --> 02:49.453
They poured four units in her.

02:49.453 --> 02:51.428
It's touch and go she'll survive.

02:51.428 --> 02:52.774
What about the rape kit?

02:52.774 --> 02:55.322
It turned up hair, semen, bruising,

02:55.322 --> 02:57.915
and blood from a freshly perforated hymen.

02:57.915 --> 02:58.945
A virgin.

02:58.945 --> 03:02.185
You know what the chief was telling me
during our last conversation?

03:02.185 --> 03:04.578
It's pucker time, folks.

03:04.578 --> 03:07.346
Now, call every precinct, transit,
and housing district.

03:07.346 --> 03:09.224
See if anybody reported her missing.

03:09.224 --> 03:11.213
Go talk to the park precinct captain.

03:11.213 --> 03:14.006
See if there's any ongoing problems
we should know about.

03:14.006 --> 03:17.587
But be warned,
that guy is a jerk times 10.

03:18.035 --> 03:20.119
Crime in the park is the lowest in 30 years.

03:20.119 --> 03:21.075
It was different today.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.248
Today was an anomaly.
That's why I'm out here.

03:23.248 --> 03:27.069
All we're asking is whether you have
any wolf-pack type activity on your radar.

03:27.069 --> 03:29.288
Like the wilding
after the Portofino Day Parade.

03:29.288 --> 03:30.679
Another anomaly.

03:30.679 --> 03:33.575
Look, we get the usual isolated incidents,
but no gangs.

03:33.575 --> 03:35.460
- Not in my park.
- Captain, one more question...

03:35.460 --> 03:39.023
Look, call me.
I got people waiting.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.150
Had a nice chat with your superior.

03:47.150 --> 03:48.643
Lovely guy.

03:48.643 --> 03:51.026
Capt. Walson give you
the not-in-my-park routine?

03:51.026 --> 03:52.566
Why? You know different?

03:52.566 --> 03:55.691
He's worried about getting his ass dragged
down to the Morris Commission.

03:55.691 --> 03:56.995
Why, what's he spooked about?

03:56.995 --> 04:00.391
The brass versus big bucks,
with him in the middle.

04:00.391 --> 04:04.105
Bunch of private school punks on their
mountain bikes trying to be gangsters

04:04.105 --> 04:07.079
who get their kicks lifting purses,
or surrounding some pretty thing

04:07.079 --> 04:08.496
and scaring the hell out of her.

04:08.496 --> 04:10.724
And he didn't tell us this because...

04:10.724 --> 04:13.804
Because he didn't spot this pattern
till yesterday.

04:13.804 --> 04:15.195
Know who these kids are?

04:15.195 --> 04:17.762
Yeah, I busted one of
their leaders last week.

04:18.589 --> 04:22.367
Apartment of Chris Lyons
63 West 88th Street
Tuesday, September 19

04:24.090 --> 04:27.056
Hi. I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

04:27.056 --> 04:28.118
What now?

04:28.118 --> 04:30.987
- Is Chris Lyons at home?
- You want to talk to him?

04:30.987 --> 04:33.533
Here, call our attorney.

04:33.533 --> 04:36.183
Okay. We can either do this the easy way,
or we can do it your way.

04:36.183 --> 04:38.192
Now, your way means a search warrant.

04:38.192 --> 04:40.149
Six officers inside your townhouse

04:40.149 --> 04:42.092
turning it upside down well
into the evening.

04:42.092 --> 04:44.057
I'm sure your neighbors
would understand.

04:44.057 --> 04:47.064
We'll meet you at our attorney's office.

04:50.685 --> 04:52.663
Is there a reason
you're harassing my client?

04:52.663 --> 04:55.355
Yeah. Your client was arrested last week

04:55.355 --> 04:58.111
for threatening a mother walking her
infant in a stroller.

04:58.111 --> 05:00.225
She was a dime, yo.

05:00.225 --> 05:02.009
- I was just checking her out.
- Chris.

05:02.009 --> 05:03.746
We've already answered that charge.

05:03.746 --> 05:06.625
Hey, yo, where were you
early this morning?

05:06.625 --> 05:10.224
My God.
You're talking about that woman.

05:10.224 --> 05:12.218
The attack in the park.

05:12.218 --> 05:13.920
How dare you accuse my son...

05:13.920 --> 05:15.322
David.

05:15.503 --> 05:16.908
I wasn't there.

05:16.908 --> 05:19.216
He was home all night.

05:19.216 --> 05:20.851
And don't you say another word.

05:20.851 --> 05:22.691
How about we hear about it from him?

05:22.691 --> 05:25.142
How about we don't?
He's 15.

05:25.142 --> 05:28.729
Hey, yo, homeys, you walk the walk.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.496
You got it in you to talk the talk?

05:35.964 --> 05:38.179
So we like to look at the ladies.

05:38.179 --> 05:40.162
But what happened to that lady,

05:40.162 --> 05:42.492
we're not down with that.

05:44.090 --> 05:46.497
What are you down with?

05:46.497 --> 05:48.109
Dot-comming.

05:48.109 --> 05:50.591
From 1:00 in the morning
till Pops here kicked me off.

05:50.591 --> 05:52.334
Around 9:00.

05:52.334 --> 05:54.699
You can check our records.

05:55.507 --> 05:57.575
We'll be in touch with you.

06:01.174 --> 06:02.274
What have we got?

06:02.274 --> 06:04.942
Lab called. It's not what we thought.

06:05.701 --> 06:08.725
Your victim only had
one person's DNA inside her.

06:08.725 --> 06:10.808
She was dumped after she was stabbed.

06:10.808 --> 06:12.543
Are you sure about that?

06:12.543 --> 06:14.985
Hospital says
she lost half her blood volume.

06:14.985 --> 06:17.499
We didn't find anywhere near
that amount of blood at the scene.

06:17.499 --> 06:18.962
Okay. Fibers?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.355
White cotton.

06:20.355 --> 06:23.977
Found in the blood, on her clothes,
her legs and genitals.

06:23.977 --> 06:26.165
Meaning she wasn't wearing any pants.

06:26.165 --> 06:30.038
The attack followed the rape
by maybe eight hours.

06:30.038 --> 06:31.719
Anything on the rocks?

06:31.719 --> 06:33.538
We found a bloody print.

06:33.723 --> 06:38.590
Doesn't match the victim or anyone
in the system. But this...

06:38.750 --> 06:41.184
may help you ID her.

06:41.564 --> 06:43.129
She was wearing it.

06:43.129 --> 06:45.714
CSU picked it up at the hospital.

06:46.476 --> 06:48.431
Hanford.

06:48.431 --> 06:50.503
You wanted to go back to college.

06:50.503 --> 06:52.194
Now's your chance.

06:52.426 --> 06:54.146
Hanford University Admissions Office
Wednesday, September 20

06:54.146 --> 06:55.422
Any of these?

06:55.422 --> 06:56.520
No.

06:56.765 --> 07:00.463
No. No. No.

07:00.665 --> 07:04.787
We think she's from somewhere
in the Middle East, maybe Israel.

07:07.633 --> 07:09.892
Wait. Elliot, look at this.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.313
Amir... / Amir, Nafeesa.

07:12.313 --> 07:15.719
23, School of Journalism.
Post office box...

07:15.719 --> 07:18.180
That zip code looks like the East Village.

07:18.180 --> 07:19.275
She's from Afghanistan.

07:19.275 --> 07:22.912
Emergency notification, Daoud Tarzi,
East Village.

07:22.912 --> 07:25.568
We need to fax Munch that photo ID.

07:29.102 --> 07:31.084
Mr. Tarzi?

07:31.379 --> 07:33.634
He doesn't live here anymore.
What do you want?

07:33.634 --> 07:35.209
Who are you?

07:35.209 --> 07:36.536
David Hamoud.

07:36.536 --> 07:38.481
How about some ID?

07:45.233 --> 07:47.593
Anything with a photo on it?

07:47.971 --> 07:49.621
No, I don't drive...

07:49.621 --> 07:53.687
and my passport's
in my safety deposit box.

07:54.447 --> 07:56.547
Have you seen this woman?

07:58.123 --> 07:59.797
No. Who is she?

07:59.797 --> 08:02.195
How long have you lived here?

08:02.195 --> 08:04.219
I just moved in last week.

08:04.219 --> 08:05.746
Do you know where Mr. Tarzi is?

08:05.746 --> 08:07.801
I'd tell you who the super is if I knew.

08:07.801 --> 08:10.060
I got a stuffed drain with his name on it.

08:10.060 --> 08:12.464
You got that trying to fix it yourself?

08:12.464 --> 08:15.354
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

08:15.354 --> 08:18.957
I'm sorry, if you'll excuse me.
I'm late for a meeting.

08:19.513 --> 08:22.864
I'll be back in the evening
if you want to talk.

08:24.185 --> 08:25.914
Oh, God.

08:25.914 --> 08:27.224
Is that her?

08:27.224 --> 08:29.092
I can't be sure.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.890
She missed class this morning.

08:30.890 --> 08:32.113
Is that unusual?

08:32.113 --> 08:35.073
I've had Nafeesa in different sections
each semester.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.592
She's never missed a class.

08:36.592 --> 08:40.272
Professor, you ever talk one-on-one
with her? / Constantly.

08:40.272 --> 08:43.205
She couldn't believe
how free the press is here.

08:43.205 --> 08:46.773
The Taliban government
in Afghanistan controls the media

08:46.773 --> 08:50.007
- the way they control women.
- She came here to escape?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.256
Well, unless she sneaked
out of the country

08:52.256 --> 08:54.732
her parents must also be here.

08:54.732 --> 08:57.920
Afghan women can't even leave
their homes on their own.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.179
She have any friends in the class?

09:00.179 --> 09:03.347
Annette Fleming.
They were joined at the hip.

09:05.826 --> 09:07.690
It's her.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.645
I can't believe it.

09:09.645 --> 09:11.569
When was the last time you saw her?

09:11.569 --> 09:14.800
Just yesterday, in class.
How could this happen?

09:14.800 --> 09:16.549
Well, maybe you can help us find out.

09:16.549 --> 09:19.404
Was she acting like
anything was wrong lately?

09:19.404 --> 09:22.857
The opposite. Nafeesa was loving life.

09:22.857 --> 09:24.605
She have a boyfriend?

09:24.605 --> 09:26.902
She wouldn't talk about it.

09:26.902 --> 09:29.517
I think it was her way
of protecting herself.

09:29.517 --> 09:31.553
Protecting herself from what?

09:31.553 --> 09:33.279
Her father.

09:33.279 --> 09:35.596
An Afghan diplomat.

09:35.596 --> 09:38.338
She thought that he may
have been looking for her.

09:38.338 --> 09:41.625
If he had his way, Nafeesa and
I wouldn't even be friends.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.092
Sounds like a strict guy.

09:43.092 --> 09:44.741
A control freak.

09:44.741 --> 09:47.465
He wouldn't let her go out,
made her wear the robes.

09:47.465 --> 09:49.442
Like she had to back home?

09:49.442 --> 09:51.863
She'd wear them when she left the house

09:51.863 --> 09:53.997
and change when she got to school.

09:53.997 --> 09:58.313
She hated so much that
she had to do that.

09:58.313 --> 10:02.547
She was talking to Prof. Husseini,
who was helping her to adjust.

10:02.547 --> 10:05.477
And where did she keep
these forbidden clothes?

10:05.477 --> 10:07.529
In her locker.

10:13.954 --> 10:16.286
- You gotta sign for this.
- Yep.

10:20.712 --> 10:22.207
- That's it?
- That'll be all.

10:22.207 --> 10:23.652
Thanks, guys.

10:23.652 --> 10:27.655
Can you imagine what Maureen would do
if you told her she couldn't wear jeans?

10:27.655 --> 10:29.909
That's a place I wouldn't go.

10:31.145 --> 10:33.579
- Boyfriend?
- Could be.

10:36.801 --> 10:39.953
Her address. East Side.

10:40.483 --> 10:43.700
Apartment of Saleh and Aziza Amir
719 Third Avenue
Wednesday, September 20

10:43.700 --> 10:46.039
This young woman was found in the park.

10:46.039 --> 10:48.160
Do you recognize her?

10:48.362 --> 10:49.851
It is our daughter.

10:49.851 --> 10:52.099
She's in Intensive Care at Mount Sinai.

10:52.099 --> 10:53.307
She's dead?

10:53.307 --> 10:57.880
Actually, she's in critical condition,
but she is still alive.

10:58.098 --> 11:01.294
Nafeesa did not understand her place.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.547
She chooses a man's work.

11:03.547 --> 11:07.774
She turns her back on her traditions,
on her family.

11:07.774 --> 11:09.772
We still have a son, Jaleel.

11:09.772 --> 11:12.836
But she is dead to us.

11:12.836 --> 11:15.105
Sir, your daughter was
beaten and raped.

11:15.105 --> 11:17.528
- It is zina.
- Zina?

11:17.528 --> 11:22.568
She has slept with a man
who was not her husband.

11:22.568 --> 11:25.070
Do you recognize this man?

11:26.624 --> 11:28.267
No.

11:28.627 --> 11:30.173
Your son is...

11:30.173 --> 11:32.285
He's not here.

11:32.285 --> 11:33.814
Please.

11:35.516 --> 11:40.776
My wife and I suffer agony that
she chose this life.

11:40.776 --> 11:45.027
Please to leave us to grieve
for our daughter.

11:45.393 --> 11:47.932
What, it's her fault she was raped?

11:47.932 --> 11:50.024
She brought shame and
dishonor to her family.

11:50.024 --> 11:52.299
They behead women for that
where she comes from.

11:52.299 --> 11:55.102
My first wife dishonored me.
I had to pay her alimony.

11:55.102 --> 11:57.707
Look what we found in the knapsack.

11:57.707 --> 11:59.618
Boyfriend, maybe? Suspect.

11:59.618 --> 12:02.137
We're in the diplomatic community now.

12:02.137 --> 12:04.544
Anybody know what her father
does for the Afghanis?

12:04.544 --> 12:05.880
Only that he's with the mission.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.070
Well, let's get specific, people.

12:08.070 --> 12:10.827
If they're covered by immunity
and we go to them with anything

12:10.827 --> 12:14.190
but their daughter's condition
the "G" is all over us.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.235
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.983
It's that guy from the apartment.

12:17.983 --> 12:20.185
- Who said he never heard of her.
- Right.

12:20.185 --> 12:22.368
Well, maybe we should refresh his memory.

12:22.368 --> 12:23.816
Pick him up.

12:33.873 --> 12:36.551
He's halfway down the block.

12:43.334 --> 12:44.811
He made us.

12:49.614 --> 12:51.091
Hi. How are you?

13:06.246 --> 13:07.780
Stick them in the air.
Nice tackle.

13:07.780 --> 13:08.940
You won't find her!

13:08.940 --> 13:11.130
I'll never tell them where she is!

13:11.130 --> 13:13.119
Hear that?
I'll never tell them where she is.

13:13.119 --> 13:14.071
Who's them?

13:14.071 --> 13:15.613
You'll never find her.
We already did.

13:15.613 --> 13:17.291
You have the right to remain silent.

13:17.291 --> 13:20.064
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

13:20.064 --> 13:21.993
You have the right to an attorney...

13:24.549 --> 13:27.232
Name's Daoud Tarzi, 33.
No priors.

13:27.232 --> 13:30.431
Immigration said he got here in '88,
alone, no family.

13:30.431 --> 13:32.288
Became a citizen in '93.

13:32.288 --> 13:33.332
And what does he do?

13:33.332 --> 13:35.916
His own import-export business.
Fabrics.

13:35.916 --> 13:40.386
Well, let's keep this out of the papers
until we're sure he's the doer.

13:44.218 --> 13:45.216
I want to see her.

13:45.216 --> 13:48.159
Why? So you can beat her up 
some more?

13:50.591 --> 13:52.458
How bad is she?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.312
Critical.

13:57.544 --> 14:00.417
I'm responsible for this.

14:02.767 --> 14:05.834
Okay, you want to tell us about it?

14:07.352 --> 14:09.080
I love her.

14:09.859 --> 14:12.114
We argued.

14:12.741 --> 14:14.393
She ran out.

14:14.393 --> 14:15.744
What did you fight about?

14:15.744 --> 14:19.047
Does it matter?
Her father already won.

14:19.047 --> 14:20.614
Won what?

14:20.614 --> 14:23.621
His twisted sense of honor.

14:23.621 --> 14:26.607
His revenge for her leaving home.

14:26.607 --> 14:30.660
Well, he said she was dead to him.
Didn't sound like he wanted revenge.

14:30.660 --> 14:34.679
What he doesn't want is a reputation for
letting his women do what they please.

14:34.679 --> 14:35.685
What do you want?

14:35.685 --> 14:39.188
For her to stop acting like
she's from some primitive tribe.

14:39.188 --> 14:40.546
You couldn't handle that.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.881
She wouldn't let go.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.023
So you decided to do
something about it.

14:45.023 --> 14:47.119
I overreacted.

14:47.578 --> 14:49.653
We argued.

14:50.704 --> 14:53.487
I dared her to leave.

14:53.487 --> 14:56.044
I never thought she'd leave.

14:57.270 --> 14:59.486
I love her.

14:59.486 --> 15:01.819
I wanted to marry her.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.712
Find somebody who heard that argument.

15:03.712 --> 15:06.302
I'll call Cabot for warrants.

15:06.713 --> 15:08.185
Yeah, I heard them fighting.

15:08.185 --> 15:11.201
In their first language.
English is definitely their second.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.371
Anything you understood?

15:12.371 --> 15:14.127
Before the screaming started

15:14.127 --> 15:15.907
she called him a control freak.

15:15.907 --> 15:18.426
- And something about her father.
- Then what?

15:18.426 --> 15:20.439
Then five minutes of gibberish.

15:20.439 --> 15:23.701
Door slams,
and one of them stomps down the stoop.

15:23.701 --> 15:26.049
- Just one of them?
- Yeah, just one.

15:26.049 --> 15:29.902
Whoever stayed turned on the TV.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.987
They looked happy.

15:34.987 --> 15:36.841
They all look happy.

15:38.656 --> 15:42.423
Hey. / This was in the laundry.
Bed sheet.

15:42.423 --> 15:44.361
There's blood on it.

15:46.698 --> 15:50.450
Okay, lab says the bloodstain
on the bed sheets, it's hers.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.869
Semen's definitely his.

15:53.045 --> 15:54.089
What about the stones?

15:54.089 --> 15:56.021
No match on the prints but...

15:56.021 --> 15:59.062
they got an odd reading on the blood,
so they're retesting it.

15:59.062 --> 16:01.126
Print's not his or hers.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.624
Even without the blood on the rocks,
it's his semen.

16:03.624 --> 16:05.194
Her blood on his sheets.

16:05.194 --> 16:06.897
It's no problem.

16:07.331 --> 16:09.813
Arraignment Court Part 69
Friday, September 22

16:09.813 --> 16:11.702
People v. Daoud Tarzi.

16:11.702 --> 16:13.645
"One count attempted murder,
second degree"

16:13.645 --> 16:16.235
"one count rape in the first degree."

16:16.947 --> 16:19.427
Mr. Gibson, how does your client plead?

16:19.427 --> 16:22.057
Not guilty on both counts, Your Honor.

16:22.057 --> 16:23.512
Ms. Cabot?

16:23.512 --> 16:25.823
Your Honor, this was
a particularly brutal crime.

16:25.823 --> 16:28.793
The victim was raped, stabbed,
beaten, and left to die.

16:28.793 --> 16:30.359
We're asking for remand without bail.

16:30.359 --> 16:33.161
My client has no criminal history,
Your Honor.

16:33.161 --> 16:34.827
He's an upstanding member
of his community

16:34.827 --> 16:36.724
he has his own
import-export business...

16:36.724 --> 16:39.614
Good. Let's make sure
he doesn't export himself.

16:39.614 --> 16:42.677
The defendant is remanded without bail.

16:43.053 --> 16:44.712
What does that mean?

16:45.655 --> 16:47.125
Her parents are here.

16:51.184 --> 16:54.613
He wants me to tell you that
her parents are here.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.502
- So noted.
- He also wants me to tell you

16:56.502 --> 17:00.660
that he will take a lie detector test
against my advice.

17:00.660 --> 17:02.379
Our examiner.

17:02.379 --> 17:04.267
I'll set it up.

17:06.925 --> 17:10.315
Is your name Daoud Tarzi?

17:10.482 --> 17:11.737
Yes.

17:13.178 --> 17:16.142
Were you born in Lebanon?

17:16.857 --> 17:18.337
No.

17:19.594 --> 17:22.622
Were you born in Afghanistan?

17:22.798 --> 17:24.148
Yes.

17:26.316 --> 17:30.095
Did you rape Nafeesa Amir?

17:30.358 --> 17:31.667
No.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.635
- Do you now live in Afghanistan?
- Her parents were at the arraignment.

17:34.635 --> 17:37.276
That's a strange way to show
you don't care.

17:37.276 --> 17:40.379
Do you now live in the United States?

17:40.379 --> 17:41.848
Yes.

17:42.751 --> 17:46.459
Did you stab Nafeesa Amir?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.224
No.

17:52.086 --> 17:53.656
- How did he do?
- Passed.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.224
Or beat it.

17:55.524 --> 17:57.839
He's not the first person to fool the box.

17:57.839 --> 18:00.650
If he can fool the box,
he can fool the jury.

18:00.650 --> 18:02.350
Maybe he's telling the truth.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.266
If he proposed marriage to Nafeesa

18:04.266 --> 18:06.615
there has to be somebody else
who knows about the relationship.

18:06.615 --> 18:08.699
She wouldn't even tell her
best friend about it

18:08.699 --> 18:10.402
for fear of how her family would react.

18:10.402 --> 18:12.307
That Hanford professor.

18:12.307 --> 18:13.923
He's a Mideast specialist.

18:13.923 --> 18:16.847
He was counseling Nafeesa
on adapting to life in America.

18:16.847 --> 18:19.992
We were going to go talk to him
until we thought Tarzi confessed.

18:19.992 --> 18:25.482
Well, let's see if your professor can tell us
why their love had to be such a secret.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.144
Nafeesa Amir came to you for help.

18:30.144 --> 18:32.586
Lots of students from
my part of the world do.

18:32.586 --> 18:34.422
To help them assimilate.

18:34.422 --> 18:37.357
It's tough enough for a man.
It's even tougher for a woman.

18:37.357 --> 18:38.573
How so?

18:38.573 --> 18:41.964
They're tempted by all of the things
they're not allowed to do back home.

18:41.964 --> 18:45.126
Under the Taliban regime,
that means almost everything.

18:45.126 --> 18:46.980
Like having a job, going to school.

18:46.980 --> 18:50.286
Leaving the house alone, or
without every inch of one's body covered.

18:50.286 --> 18:52.768
She would be scorned as a vice-monger.

18:52.768 --> 18:55.064
What about her family?
They've been here for years.

18:55.064 --> 18:57.513
Her family, like all the Afghan diplomats
at the UN

18:57.513 --> 18:59.745
are holdovers from the previous government.

18:59.745 --> 19:03.024
They treated women like something
more than just indentured servants.

19:03.024 --> 19:04.535
But when the Taliban took over,

19:04.535 --> 19:07.022
they put women under virtual house arrest.

19:07.022 --> 19:10.124
There is nothing in the Koran
that allows them to do that.

19:10.124 --> 19:11.901
Well, tell their thugs.

19:11.901 --> 19:16.087
It would be like the militia running
this country.

19:16.087 --> 19:18.155
That's why the UN won't recognize them.

19:18.155 --> 19:22.012
It would be very dangerous for
Nafeesa's family to try and go back home.

19:22.012 --> 19:24.852
So Nafeesa's father is not a Taliban?

19:24.852 --> 19:26.976
Maybe he's a Taliban mole.

19:26.976 --> 19:31.450
Just because he doesn't wear their colors
does not mean he isn't with them.

19:31.450 --> 19:35.103
Nafeesa had to choose
between her family and her future.

19:35.103 --> 19:37.308
She wanted to live as a modern woman.

19:37.308 --> 19:39.923
She had to leave
her parents' home to do it.

19:39.923 --> 19:42.935
Was there any reason
she'd want to hide from her family?

19:42.935 --> 19:46.102
If she tried this kind of thing
in Afghanistan...

19:46.102 --> 19:49.717
women there have been
murdered for less.

19:49.717 --> 19:51.521
Much less.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.954
We have enough to convict you, 
Mr. Tarzi.

19:57.954 --> 20:02.062
Even if you did pass the lie detector test,
you confessed to the police.

20:02.062 --> 20:04.328
Confession?
I never confessed.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.783
You said, quote,
"I am responsible for this."

20:07.783 --> 20:10.813
I meant that I feel responsible,
not that I attacked her.

20:10.813 --> 20:12.720
He passed the lie detector test.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.873
- It wasn't his DNA on the stones.
- It was his DNA inside her.

20:22.569 --> 20:26.240
We were from
the same part of Afghanistan.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.926
Near Kabul.

20:29.102 --> 20:32.556
I helped her to find an apartment.

20:33.261 --> 20:35.492
I wanted to help her find herself.

20:35.492 --> 20:38.116
What was she looking for?

20:41.574 --> 20:45.824
To be more than a factory
for producing sons.

20:47.231 --> 20:49.779
We fell in love...

20:50.771 --> 20:53.645
but we couldn't tell anyone.

20:54.271 --> 20:56.562
She didn't want her father to find her.

20:56.562 --> 20:59.793
Why? Was she afraid of him?

21:01.979 --> 21:05.233
She's the reason he has his job...

21:05.233 --> 21:08.559
his apartment, his car with a driver.

21:08.559 --> 21:14.322
How is it, in a society where a woman
has no authority, she has all this power?

21:15.389 --> 21:19.069
He promised her to the son of
a government minister.

21:19.069 --> 21:24.145
Turning her back on that was
like spitting in her father's face.

21:24.581 --> 21:27.733
And the night Nafeesa was attacked?

21:31.154 --> 21:34.215
I asked her to marry me.

21:35.992 --> 21:38.997
Gave her a diamond ring.

21:39.955 --> 21:42.526
She said yes.

21:46.714 --> 21:48.434
She was a virgin.

21:48.434 --> 21:50.940
- You forced her.
- No.

21:51.210 --> 21:55.710
She didn't say no.

21:56.135 --> 21:58.633
But I shouldn't have pushed her.

21:58.633 --> 22:00.070
And she walked out?

22:00.070 --> 22:04.078
She said I was trying to dominate her.

22:04.078 --> 22:05.405
She throws the ring in my face.

22:05.405 --> 22:09.260
Before I could stop her,
she's out the door.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.306
I should have tried to stop her.

22:12.306 --> 22:14.998
Why all the lies?

22:15.177 --> 22:17.084
You see this?

22:17.084 --> 22:19.356
It's from a cop.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.348
What cop?

22:21.348 --> 22:23.312
Came looking for Nafeesa.

22:23.312 --> 22:26.376
He had a gold badge.

22:26.612 --> 22:29.859
I knew Nafeesa's father sent him.

22:34.866 --> 22:37.711
If it isn't Bishop Tutuola.

22:38.296 --> 22:41.026
John Munch. Ross Campo.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.340
What brings you guys to this dump?

22:43.340 --> 22:44.848
This.

22:44.848 --> 22:46.623
- It's yours.
- What about it?

22:46.623 --> 22:49.520
You laid it on the boyfriend of that girl
we found in the park.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.451
I got nothing to say about that.

22:51.451 --> 22:54.040
He does. Especially the part about
you breaking his head.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.687
Like you never tuned
anyone up on the job?

22:56.687 --> 22:58.863
My pleasing personality
usually does the trick.

22:58.863 --> 23:01.215
You, on the other hand,
weren't on the job.

23:01.215 --> 23:05.190
So I do a little work on the side.
Help me out here, Fin.

23:05.190 --> 23:06.071
Come on.

23:06.071 --> 23:08.426
Better us bring this to you than IAB, right?

23:08.426 --> 23:13.293
Last time I checked, cops weren't
allowed to moonlight as Pls.

23:15.302 --> 23:16.858
Three weeks ago...

23:16.858 --> 23:19.848
boss at the security company
I work for gets a call.

23:19.848 --> 23:22.620
Some diplomat looking for
his missing daughter.

23:22.620 --> 23:25.979
Says they're going back to their tent
in the desert, wants to bring her with them.

23:25.979 --> 23:28.487
- Asked me to check it out.
- You find her?

23:28.487 --> 23:30.446
I got as far as the boyfriend.

23:30.446 --> 23:31.552
Says he doesn't know her.

23:31.552 --> 23:34.629
His mouth is moving,
her picture's hanging behind him.

23:34.629 --> 23:36.459
Like I'm some knucklehead.

23:36.459 --> 23:38.174
So I tune him up a little.

23:38.174 --> 23:39.568
But he still didn't tell you.

23:39.568 --> 23:42.832
Said I might as well shoot him,
'cause he was never gonna tell me.

23:42.832 --> 23:44.750
And she never showed?

23:44.750 --> 23:48.399
I sat on the place for two nights.
Nothing.

23:54.115 --> 23:56.362
- Final lab report.
- And?

23:56.362 --> 23:58.105
We've got a problem.

23:58.388 --> 24:00.157
There were two types of
DNA on the stones.

24:00.157 --> 24:02.515
One was Nafeesa's,
and the other was Tarzi's.

24:02.515 --> 24:04.065
Well, if not him, then who?

24:04.065 --> 24:06.137
That's why they retested the blood.

24:06.137 --> 24:09.261
Lab says both DNA types have
similar characteristics.

24:09.261 --> 24:11.134
Meaning it was a family member.

24:11.134 --> 24:13.339
Anything else we don't know
about these people?

24:13.339 --> 24:16.655
The State Department has
the father listed as an attache.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.104
Diplomatic rank.

24:18.104 --> 24:21.152
Jaleel Amir just turned 21,
graduated NYU.

24:21.152 --> 24:22.404
He still lives with his parents?

24:22.404 --> 24:23.593
Yes, he does.

24:23.593 --> 24:25.692
But he's not a student?

24:26.779 --> 24:28.332
Hello?

24:28.332 --> 24:31.603
His immunity expired the day
he turned 21.

24:32.419 --> 24:34.877
She died 10 minutes ago.

24:41.423 --> 24:43.465
Has Nafeesa Amir been around lately?

24:43.465 --> 24:45.724
Yeah. She was here Tuesday night.

24:45.724 --> 24:46.779
What time?

24:46.779 --> 24:48.102
Around 7:00.

24:48.102 --> 24:51.395
Woman gets out of a cab,
tries to run past me.

24:51.395 --> 24:53.756
I didn't know it was Nafeesa.
She wasn't wearing the get-up.

24:53.756 --> 24:56.798
- She say anything to you?
- Too busy crying.

24:56.798 --> 24:58.734
I know she's family.
I just let her go up.

24:58.734 --> 24:59.935
Did you see her leave?

24:59.935 --> 25:02.261
No. But that doesn't mean she didn't.

25:02.261 --> 25:04.548
I get off at 11:00. Ask the night guy.

25:04.548 --> 25:08.415
Anyone else in her family,
you see them come in or out?

25:08.597 --> 25:10.600
Her brother came out.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.824
Jaleel.

25:11.824 --> 25:14.242
Bastard treats me like his personal slave.

25:14.242 --> 25:16.773
- What time was that?
- Around 8:00.

25:16.773 --> 25:21.198
He calls, orders me to bring
the big shopping cart upstairs.

25:21.198 --> 25:22.436
Did you?

25:22.436 --> 25:25.259
You kidding? The guy hasn't
tipped me in four years.

25:25.259 --> 25:28.194
Told him I couldn't leave the desk,
come get it yourself.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.633
Any idea what he wanted it for?

25:30.906 --> 25:34.191
Whatever it was,
he didn't bring it through this door.

25:34.836 --> 25:37.954
Must have put it in his car in the garage.

25:38.524 --> 25:41.025
I told you to leave us alone!

25:41.025 --> 25:44.430
Sir, your daughter passed away,
and you don't even care.

25:44.430 --> 25:46.142
Saleh?

25:46.142 --> 25:47.645
Go now. Where's your son?

25:47.645 --> 25:48.542
Get out.

25:48.542 --> 25:50.977
We know Nafeesa was here
the night of the attack.

25:50.977 --> 25:53.210
Doorman saw her come in.
Nobody saw her leave.

25:53.210 --> 25:56.565
Because your son took her out through
the garage and dumped her in the park.

25:56.565 --> 25:58.844
Were you watching when
he put the knife through her heart?

25:58.844 --> 26:01.045
She was a whore, like you.

26:01.045 --> 26:03.496
She was your daughter!

26:03.706 --> 26:06.240
He is on his way home to Afghanistan.

26:06.534 --> 26:07.797
Okay.

26:07.797 --> 26:11.114
My son is protected by the Vienna Convention.

26:11.114 --> 26:14.147
Arresting him is a violation
of international law.

26:14.147 --> 26:16.629
You need to take a refresher course
in international law.

26:16.629 --> 26:20.064
The day he turned 21,
his number was up.

26:23.127 --> 26:24.904
Would you like some?
No?

26:24.904 --> 26:27.823
- Juice?
- No, thanks. We're just visiting.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.705
Jaleel Amir?

26:33.705 --> 26:36.923
I am proud I killed her.
She deserved to die.

26:36.923 --> 26:38.024
This amuse you?

26:38.024 --> 26:40.845
Jaleel Amir, you're under arrest
for the murder of Nafeesa Amir.

26:40.845 --> 26:42.333
You have the right to remain silent.

26:42.333 --> 26:44.205
You think you can arrest me?

26:44.205 --> 26:47.220
My father will have me
on the next plane home.

26:47.485 --> 26:49.548
I'll probably need Munch for trial.

26:49.548 --> 26:51.056
Anticipating problems?

26:51.056 --> 26:55.073
A diplomat's son?
I expect a very heavy gun.

26:55.857 --> 26:59.123
Captain. Ms. Cabot.

26:59.335 --> 27:00.725
Something wrong, sir?

27:00.725 --> 27:01.966
All I want to know is,

27:01.966 --> 27:06.673
did two of your detectives
harass a diplomatic attache?

27:06.673 --> 27:09.454
No, sir. We went looking for his son.

27:09.454 --> 27:11.942
But what we should have done was
arrest Saleh Amir

27:11.942 --> 27:13.755
as an accomplice to
his daughter's murder.

27:13.755 --> 27:16.614
- If I may, I'd like to...
- No, you may not.

27:16.614 --> 27:19.604
Amir has filed a formal complaint
against the US government

27:19.604 --> 27:23.355
for his ill-treatment by the NYPD,
and the Feds are eating it up.

27:23.355 --> 27:25.941
The case against Jaleel Amir is solid,
Deputy,

27:25.941 --> 27:28.197
and frankly, it's out of your hands.

27:28.197 --> 27:31.067
I've got two rogue cops
who browbeat foreign officials

27:31.067 --> 27:34.323
two others who don't understand
the basic Miranda warning.

27:34.323 --> 27:36.612
Cases get dismissed for much less.

27:36.612 --> 27:38.665
The suspect was properly Mirandized.

27:38.665 --> 27:42.408
He did confess before he was warned,
but it was an excited utterance.

27:42.408 --> 27:44.397
Which makes it admissible.

27:44.397 --> 27:46.156
The only way this case will not see

27:46.156 --> 27:49.200
the inside of a courtroom
is if Jaleel pleads out.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.447
I suggest that you reconsider your position.

27:53.667 --> 27:56.728
And why would I want to do that?

27:59.948 --> 28:02.713
To save your own skin?

28:08.971 --> 28:11.944
I need the five on your tete-a-tete
with Saleh Amir.

28:11.944 --> 28:16.324
- I'm cleaning it up right now.
- If it's not pig Latin, "now" means now.

28:16.324 --> 28:17.708
All right.
Where's the heat coming from?

28:17.708 --> 28:21.279
The Commissioner.
Saleh Amir told the State Department

28:21.279 --> 28:23.941
that we violated Article 30
of the Vienna Convention

28:23.941 --> 28:26.160
because you grilled him about his son.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.185
We didn't grill him.

28:27.185 --> 28:31.338
If this had happened back home Jaleel
would have done three months in prison

28:31.338 --> 28:33.067
and gotten a hero's welcome
when he came out.

28:33.067 --> 28:36.106
Well, this is the Afghanis playing hardball.

28:36.873 --> 28:39.853
Chambers of Judge Alan Ridenour
Thursday, October 26

28:39.853 --> 28:41.933
They didn't Mirandize my client.

28:41.933 --> 28:43.335
It was an excited utterance.

28:43.335 --> 28:46.808
- We have a planeload of witnesses.
- Relax, Ms. Cabot.

28:46.808 --> 28:50.166
I'm not about to penalize
the police for doing their job.

28:50.166 --> 28:53.892
Mr. Amir's confession
was an excited utterance, and it's in.

28:53.892 --> 28:57.309
In that case, Your Honor,
my client is changing his plea

28:57.309 --> 29:01.163
to not guilty by reason of mental disease
or defect. / Give me a break.

29:01.163 --> 29:04.509
My client didn't know what he was doing
was wrong when he killed his sister.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.802
Ignorance of the law is not
an affirmative defense.

29:06.802 --> 29:10.019
He told the police
he was proud of what he did.

29:10.019 --> 29:11.590
That sound sane to you?

29:11.590 --> 29:13.289
Your Honor,
it's obvious what he's doing.

29:13.289 --> 29:16.972
He can't hide behind the
Fourth Amendment, so now it's insanity.

29:16.972 --> 29:20.407
And if I ignore him,
it could be reversed on appeal.

29:20.407 --> 29:24.404
I'm ordering Mr. Amir
be examined by a psychiatrist.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.743
Rikers Island Correctional Facility
Friday, October 27

29:28.743 --> 29:31.308
You have nightmares about Nafeesa?

29:36.001 --> 29:39.005
The Koran says Nafeesa's shame
before God is her own.

29:39.005 --> 29:41.263
That it can't be passed to you,

29:41.263 --> 29:44.733
that she faces the consequences alone.

29:45.214 --> 29:51.618
Did Abraham have a choice when
Allah commanded him to kill his own son?

29:56.588 --> 29:59.483
I can't talk about this.

29:59.483 --> 30:02.495
Can't or don't want to?

30:02.725 --> 30:05.989
I have nightmares.
Isn't that enough?

30:05.989 --> 30:09.072
How long have you had the nightmares?

30:09.964 --> 30:13.883
Since I was 8 years old.

30:13.883 --> 30:16.489
When it happened.

30:16.489 --> 30:18.776
Do they wake you up?

30:20.796 --> 30:25.585
After he slits her throat.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.428
Whose throat?

30:28.599 --> 30:32.312
My...my aunt.

30:34.982 --> 30:37.778
I can't do this.

30:37.778 --> 30:40.861
Because you couldn't stop it?

30:42.381 --> 30:44.397
I was a child.

30:44.397 --> 30:47.670
My father made me watch.

30:47.842 --> 30:50.855
How was I supposed to stop it?

30:50.855 --> 30:52.451
Your father killed your aunt?

30:52.451 --> 30:55.110
My grandfather.

30:59.149 --> 31:02.541
His grandfather killed his aunt
because she cheated on her husband.

31:02.541 --> 31:04.934
Jaleel was just following the rules.

31:04.934 --> 31:08.769
He's perverting holy scripture
to justify murder.

31:08.769 --> 31:10.333
It's what he was taught.

31:10.333 --> 31:13.878
His rite of passage to manhood, to honor.

31:13.878 --> 31:16.029
Meaning he doesn't know
what he did was wrong?

31:16.029 --> 31:17.725
I think he does.

31:17.725 --> 31:20.323
I asked him if he has nightmares
about his sister.

31:20.323 --> 31:21.751
He wouldn't answer.

31:21.751 --> 31:24.462
His body language said yes.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.868
And a jury may be just
as confused as he is.

31:27.868 --> 31:32.929
Then you have to get a jury that
can see past their confusion.

31:36.363 --> 31:37.909
Mrs. Weinberger,
would you have a problem

31:37.909 --> 31:41.836
finding a defendant from
the Middle East not guilty?

31:41.836 --> 31:43.528
Absolutely not.

31:43.528 --> 31:44.881
Thank you.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.885
Mr. Post.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.003
We thank Mrs. Weinberger for her service,
and ask that she be excused.

31:52.003 --> 31:54.318
Approach, Your Honor?

31:56.591 --> 31:59.560
Your Honor, all 10 of his peremptory
challenges have been women or Jews.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.052
I don't have to give a reason.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.871
If this continues I'll have
to ask for a Batson hearing.

32:02.871 --> 32:05.233
- You can't let her stack the jury...
- With women?

32:05.233 --> 32:06.657
People v. Blunt.

32:06.657 --> 32:09.994
The appellate division specifically
applied Batson to gender discrimination.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.386
It applies to religion, too.

32:11.386 --> 32:14.061
Your Honor... / Careful, Mr. Post.
Ms. Cabot is right.

32:14.061 --> 32:17.254
You don't want a Batson hearing
in this court.

32:20.310 --> 32:22.590
Supreme Court Trial Part 78
Wednesday, November 1

32:22.590 --> 32:26.054
We boarded the plane. The defendant
was sitting in the first-class cabin.

32:26.054 --> 32:28.065
Did he know you were there for him?

32:28.065 --> 32:30.099
Yes. He smiled.

32:30.618 --> 32:32.689
Tell the jury what happened next.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.501
Before we could read him
his Miranda Rights

32:34.501 --> 32:37.249
Mr. Amir confessed to having
killed his sister.

32:37.249 --> 32:39.844
What were his exact words?

32:39.844 --> 32:42.792
"I'm proud that I killed her.
She deserved to die."

32:42.792 --> 32:44.735
Thank you, Detective.

32:46.597 --> 32:50.641
So, Mr. Amir showed no remorse
for having murdered his sister?

32:50.641 --> 32:52.623
On the contrary, he was proud of it.

32:52.623 --> 32:54.926
In fact, you said he seemed
glad to see you.

32:54.926 --> 32:56.513
I said he smiled.

32:56.513 --> 32:59.965
He smiled at you and said
he was proud.

32:59.965 --> 33:02.096
Doesn't seem like something
a sane person would do.

33:02.096 --> 33:04.348
Objection! Detective Munch
is not a psychiatrist.

33:04.348 --> 33:05.944
Withdrawn.

33:06.546 --> 33:09.328
Detective, how many people have
you arrested in your career?

33:09.328 --> 33:11.840
- I don't know the exact number.
- More than 100, correct?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.039
Probably.

33:13.039 --> 33:15.165
How many of them smiled at you

33:15.165 --> 33:19.212
and said they were proud
of having killed someone?

33:20.416 --> 33:21.565
One.

33:21.565 --> 33:26.217
And the defendant is that one person,
isn't that right, Detective?

33:26.823 --> 33:28.543
Yes.

33:28.951 --> 33:31.094
No further questions.

33:31.878 --> 33:34.634
He shows signs of severe trauma.

33:34.634 --> 33:35.990
What signs?

33:35.990 --> 33:37.760
Delusional thinking...

33:37.760 --> 33:42.489
night terrors, vivid, recurring dreams
that wake him.

33:42.489 --> 33:44.659
He avoids talking about it if he can.

33:44.659 --> 33:46.196
In your professional opinion, Doctor

33:46.196 --> 33:48.202
do these symptoms prevent Mr. Amir

33:48.202 --> 33:51.525
from knowing the difference
between right and wrong?

33:51.525 --> 33:52.964
No.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.119
Thank you.

33:57.184 --> 33:59.627
Dr. Skoda, you say the defendant knows

33:59.627 --> 34:02.402
what he did was wrong by our standards.

34:02.402 --> 34:03.447
Yes.

34:03.447 --> 34:06.774
Doctor, if I wake in the night
and I hear a noise, and I take my gun,

34:06.774 --> 34:09.121
and I shoot an intruder in my house

34:09.121 --> 34:10.694
I know killing is morally wrong,

34:10.694 --> 34:13.985
yet I did what I had to do
to save my family from harm.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.891
How is that different from
what the defendant did?

34:15.891 --> 34:17.259
Objection. Relevance?

34:17.259 --> 34:19.072
Goes to the defendant's state of mind.

34:19.072 --> 34:21.632
If you're arguing self-defense,
this is an insanity case.

34:21.632 --> 34:25.257
And this question goes directly to
what was in my client's mind.

34:25.257 --> 34:27.085
I'll allow it.

34:27.085 --> 34:29.606
Please answer the question, Doctor.

34:30.516 --> 34:33.065
Jaleel's sister wasn't threatening to kill him.

34:33.065 --> 34:34.964
But Jaleel thought his sister's actions

34:34.964 --> 34:38.106
threatened to destroy his life
and the lives of his future children.

34:38.106 --> 34:39.822
Isn't that right, Doctor?

34:39.822 --> 34:41.456
It's not a valid comparison.

34:41.456 --> 34:43.667
Please answer the question, Doctor.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.522
Isn't it true my client believed

34:45.522 --> 34:49.989
his sister's actions threatened
the lives of his family?

34:49.989 --> 34:51.732
It's possible.

34:51.732 --> 34:54.876
I can't say with certainty
what he was thinking.

34:54.876 --> 34:56.408
Exactly.

34:56.408 --> 34:58.066
Thank you, Doctor.

35:01.155 --> 35:03.024
In Deuteronomy, the Bible says

35:03.024 --> 35:06.706
if a man meets a virgin in a town
and sleeps with her

35:06.706 --> 35:08.959
you shall stone them both to death.

35:08.959 --> 35:11.488
But, Professor, honor killing isn't
about religion.

35:11.488 --> 35:12.339
No.

35:12.339 --> 35:15.670
The Koran says all humans are equal.

35:15.670 --> 35:20.683
It is about families and their honor
that determines their status in society.

35:20.683 --> 35:24.829
So if a man believes a woman
in his family is sexually promiscuous

35:24.829 --> 35:27.070
she has reason to fear for her life.

35:27.070 --> 35:29.256
Yes. But countries like
Jordan and Egypt are trying

35:29.256 --> 35:33.006
to make honor killing as legally heinous
as any other murder...

35:33.006 --> 35:34.924
with the same penalties.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.603
Thank you, Professor.

35:37.775 --> 35:39.643
Prof. Husseini,

35:39.643 --> 35:43.458
honor killings are part of
ancient cultural tenets.

35:43.458 --> 35:44.732
Yes.

35:44.732 --> 35:49.717
Part of the cultural fabric that
pre-exists modern society.

35:49.717 --> 35:50.856
Yes.

35:50.856 --> 35:54.575
So if you're raised in the tradition
of this ancient culture

35:54.575 --> 35:58.775
what would you believe would
happen to a family without honor?

35:58.775 --> 36:00.764
The men could lose their jobs,

36:00.764 --> 36:02.996
the children could become outcasts

36:02.996 --> 36:07.280
the family could be scorned and mocked,
with no chance of success...

36:07.280 --> 36:09.536
until the honor is restored.

36:09.536 --> 36:12.948
And for a man, that means
controlling his women?

36:12.948 --> 36:13.891
Yes.

36:13.891 --> 36:15.982
Isn't it true that last year,

36:15.982 --> 36:20.426
three out of every four murders in the
Gaza Strip and West Bank were honor killings?

36:20.426 --> 36:22.122
Yes. But the Palestinians...

36:22.122 --> 36:25.420
Isn't it true that the only way
these countries have to protect women

36:25.420 --> 36:28.122
from their own families is
to put them in prison?

36:28.122 --> 36:29.873
In protective custody, yes.

36:29.873 --> 36:33.202
And isn't it correct, Professor
that in this barbaric custom,

36:33.202 --> 36:38.392
the more brutal the killing
the greater the honor restored to the family?

36:38.554 --> 36:39.574
Yes.

36:39.574 --> 36:41.590
So it's reasonable,
having grown up in this world

36:41.590 --> 36:47.247
my client may have come to accept honor
killing as necessary to survive?

36:47.247 --> 36:48.712
Well, he may have accepted it,

36:48.712 --> 36:52.339
but I hardly think that it is reasonable.

36:54.887 --> 36:58.787
I had to restore my family's honor.
We would never survive the shame.

36:58.787 --> 37:00.988
You've had time to think about it.

37:00.988 --> 37:04.555
Would you change anything that happened,
if you could?

37:05.043 --> 37:08.523
I would change what Nafeesa did to us.

37:09.065 --> 37:10.772
Thank you.

37:13.212 --> 37:15.774
You killed your sister because
she was with a man.

37:15.774 --> 37:17.871
Her marriage was arranged.

37:17.871 --> 37:22.221
Being with another man was
not her decision to make.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.819
When you dumped your sister's body
in the park

37:24.819 --> 37:26.982
why did you leave her half-naked?

37:26.982 --> 37:29.657
To shame her as she shamed us.

37:29.657 --> 37:32.048
And the stones?

37:32.048 --> 37:35.261
That is what we do to whores
in my country.

37:35.261 --> 37:37.581
You're proud of what you did?

37:37.581 --> 37:38.731
Yes.

37:38.731 --> 37:42.777
Then, Mr. Amir, why did you run away?

37:47.164 --> 37:48.625
What do you mean?

37:48.625 --> 37:51.060
You're a man, aren't you?

37:51.220 --> 37:53.366
A man stands up and takes responsibility.

37:53.366 --> 37:58.202
A man isn't afraid to face the
consequences of his actions.

37:58.202 --> 38:00.213
- I am not afraid.
- No?

38:00.213 --> 38:03.936
The police arrested you on the plane.
You were running away.

38:03.936 --> 38:05.900
Does that sound honorable to you?

38:05.900 --> 38:08.120
Does that sound like something
a real man would do?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.768
You are twisting everything.

38:09.768 --> 38:11.072
Objection. Badgering the witness.

38:11.072 --> 38:14.581
Even now, you were looking at
your father to tell you what to do.

38:14.581 --> 38:16.271
Does he tell you what to do?

38:16.271 --> 38:17.772
Did he tell you what to do that night, too?

38:17.772 --> 38:20.198
Objection! Irrelevant.
Move to strike.

38:20.198 --> 38:23.729
The jury will disregard the previous mention
of the defendant's father.

38:23.729 --> 38:25.157
Move on, Ms. Cabot.

38:25.157 --> 38:29.111
You were afraid of spending the rest of
your life in an American prison weren't you?

38:29.111 --> 38:32.064
That's a lie! / Because you knew
what you did was wrong.

38:32.064 --> 38:36.701
No! I did it for our family's honor!

38:49.558 --> 38:51.793
I'm concerned the jury's buying
Jaleel's act.

38:51.793 --> 38:54.885
What? That anyone who kills his own sister
has to believe he's doing the right thing?

38:51.793 --> 38:54.885
What? That anyone who kills his own sister
has to believe he's doing the right thing?

38:54.885 --> 38:58.088
Right. Which makes him guilty
by reason of mental disease or defect.

38:54.885 --> 38:58.088
Right. Which makes him guilty
by reason of mental disease or defect.

38:58.088 --> 39:01.271
- Hard to argue with that logic.
- You can see my problem.

38:58.088 --> 39:01.271
- Hard to argue with that logic.
- You can see my problem.

39:01.271 --> 39:03.356
When we collared him,
he was sitting in first class

39:01.271 --> 39:03.356
When we collared him,
he was sitting in first class

39:03.356 --> 39:07.656
no cap, no beads, styling in totally
westernized Internet casual.

39:03.356 --> 39:07.656
no cap, no beads, styling in totally
westernized Internet casual.

39:07.656 --> 39:09.434
His wardrobe isn't helping me.

39:07.656 --> 39:09.434
His wardrobe isn't helping me.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.776
If the jury thinks Jaleel is
culture-programmed to kill

39:09.434 --> 39:11.776
If the jury thinks Jaleel is
culture-programmed to kill

39:11.776 --> 39:13.357
he gets his insanity verdict.

39:11.776 --> 39:13.357
he gets his insanity verdict.

39:13.357 --> 39:16.013
Well, we're out of people to say otherwise.

39:13.357 --> 39:16.013
Well, we're out of people to say otherwise.

39:16.013 --> 39:19.148
His culture didn't program him to kill.
His father did.

39:16.013 --> 39:19.148
His culture didn't program him to kill.
His father did.

39:19.148 --> 39:22.065
Jaleel is afraid of him.
Everybody is afraid of Saleh Amir.

39:19.148 --> 39:22.065
Jaleel is afraid of him.
Everybody is afraid of Saleh Amir.

39:22.065 --> 39:25.161
Except for one person.
We're forgetting Mrs. Amir.

39:22.065 --> 39:25.161
Except for one person.
We're forgetting Mrs. Amir.

39:25.161 --> 39:27.085
Mrs. Amir is out-of-bounds.

39:25.161 --> 39:27.085
Mrs. Amir is out-of-bounds.

39:27.085 --> 39:29.296
Anyway, Mrs. Amir would
never give up her son

39:27.085 --> 39:29.296
Anyway, Mrs. Amir would
never give up her son

39:29.296 --> 39:31.976
- or go against her husband.
- She already has,

39:29.296 --> 39:31.976
- or go against her husband.
- She already has,

39:31.976 --> 39:35.711
on both counts when she told us
that he was on a plane home to Afghanistan.

39:31.976 --> 39:35.711
on both counts when she told us
that he was on a plane home to Afghanistan.

39:35.711 --> 39:38.770
She testifies, she's
sentencing herself to death.

39:35.711 --> 39:38.770
She testifies, she's
sentencing herself to death.

39:38.770 --> 39:40.217
She defied her husband once

39:38.770 --> 39:40.217
She defied her husband once

39:40.217 --> 39:42.822
because he's the reason
that her daughter's dead.

39:40.217 --> 39:42.822
because he's the reason
that her daughter's dead.

39:42.822 --> 39:44.750
She wants justice for her memory.

39:42.822 --> 39:44.750
She wants justice for her memory.

39:44.750 --> 39:48.007
We reach out to her again,
I think she'll defy him again to get it.

39:44.750 --> 39:48.007
We reach out to her again,
I think she'll defy him again to get it.

39:48.007 --> 39:51.668
We can't ask unless
we're ready to protect her.

39:48.007 --> 39:51.668
We can't ask unless
we're ready to protect her.

39:52.849 --> 39:56.551
We're ready, 24-7.
Talk to her. Let her know that.

39:52.849 --> 39:56.551
We're ready, 24-7.
Talk to her. Let her know that.

39:56.551 --> 40:00.190
But don't cross the diplomatic line.

39:56.551 --> 40:00.190
But don't cross the diplomatic line.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.262

40:00.856 --> 40:03.262
Apartment of Saleh and Aziza Amir

Thursday, November 2

40:03.262 --> 40:06.778
I have already lost Nafeesa.

40:03.262 --> 40:06.778
I have already lost Nafeesa.

40:07.889 --> 40:11.464
I don't want to lose Jaleel, too.

40:07.889 --> 40:11.464
I don't want to lose Jaleel, too.

40:11.613 --> 40:14.979
But Nafeesa hasn't lost her honor.

40:11.613 --> 40:14.979
But Nafeesa hasn't lost her honor.

40:14.979 --> 40:17.551
Have you lost yours?

40:14.979 --> 40:17.551
Have you lost yours?

40:17.905 --> 40:20.040
You don't understand.

40:17.905 --> 40:20.040
You don't understand.

40:20.040 --> 38:51.793
I think we do. buying
Jaleel's act.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.882
I think we do.

40:21.882 --> 40:24.759
Nafeesa was your husband's ticket home.

40:24.759 --> 40:27.360
He promised her to a Taliban, didn't he?

40:27.360 --> 40:29.758
And when he found out that she
was sleeping with somebody else

40:29.758 --> 40:33.238
he had Jaleel kill her in the name of honor.

40:33.238 --> 40:36.247
We can offer protection to you.

40:36.698 --> 40:39.998
I don't want your protection.

40:40.572 --> 40:44.475
I want my daughter.

40:51.771 --> 40:57.471
Nafeesa came home to be with us.

40:58.317 --> 41:01.037
My husband asked her

41:01.037 --> 41:05.749
if she was still a virgin.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.893
She wasn't.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.520
What did he do?

41:11.520 --> 41:13.607
Hit her.

41:13.889 --> 41:16.428
She fell.

41:17.474 --> 41:21.013
Then Jaleel tried to help her.

41:21.013 --> 41:23.102
My husband said:

41:23.102 --> 41:27.735
"Let her lie there, like she lies with
her American boyfriend."

41:27.735 --> 41:30.159
What happened next?

41:30.159 --> 41:35.840
My husband got a knife from the kitchen.

41:35.840 --> 41:42.338
Jaleel, he begged him not to.

41:43.886 --> 41:49.831
But my husband told Jaleel to kill her..

41:49.831 --> 41:53.775
for our honor.

41:55.435 --> 41:58.836
To kill her...

41:58.836 --> 42:03.141
to prove his manhood.

42:03.141 --> 42:07.859
And he stabbed her.

42:10.736 --> 42:15.467
And they took her away.

42:34.885 --> 42:38.213
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.

42:38.406 --> 42:41.581
Will the defendant please rise?

42:43.484 --> 42:47.346
On the charge of murder
in the second degree, how do you find?

42:47.346 --> 42:49.616
We find the defendant guilty.

42:49.616 --> 42:52.019
This court is dismissed.

43:09.149 --> 43:10.771
Captain?

43:10.771 --> 43:13.659
Jaleel is convicted.
Murder two.

43:13.659 --> 43:15.241
Thanks.

43:15.241 --> 43:20.924
You know, Saleh Amir didn't
miss a second of this trial until today.

43:21.427 --> 43:24.459
You'd think he'd want to hear the verdict.

43:26.362 --> 43:28.087
- He's gone.
- Saleh Amir?

43:28.087 --> 43:29.561
Left last night in a limo.

43:29.561 --> 43:31.476
All that baggage,
looked like it was for good.

43:31.476 --> 43:33.182
- What about the wife?
- She wasn't with him.

43:33.182 --> 43:35.219
Okay, we need the keys now.

43:41.091 --> 43:42.702
