He's in good hands, Dad.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.734
Your mom and I had
a… a talk the other day.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.781
When we got our powers, uh…

06:48.157 --> 06:52.745
I felt a great responsibility
to improve the country and the world.

06:55.498 --> 06:59.627
But I had to make a lot of sacrifices
to fulfill that responsibility.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.257
And I've been tough on you
because one of those sacrifices

07:04.340 --> 07:07.677
involved somebody who was
very close to me, who felt like family,

07:08.678 --> 07:09.679
Skyfox.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.102
Skyfox felt like the Code held him back.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.232
He felt like he could do more
for the nation without it.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.236
We had so many discussions about it
in these very halls.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.323
Discussions that rang hollow because…

07:30.366 --> 07:32.326
he ended up breaking the Code anyway.

07:32.410 --> 07:36.414
That was the beginning of the end
for Skyfox and the Union,

07:36.497 --> 07:38.291

07:53.598 --> 07:55.892

07:55.975 --> 07:57.643
He was like a brother.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.938
And he turned on us,
on me, on your uncle, on all of us--

08:01.022 --> 08:02.523
Petra came to see me.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.985
She's been having some doubts
about the Code.

08:07.069 --> 08:10.740
And I found myself saying your words.

like they were scripted, but…

08:15.995 --> 08:18.414

08:20.833 --> 08:23.836
I finally knew
why the Code was so important to you,

08:24.420 --> 08:27.965
because I cared just as much
when someone else questioned it.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.595

-It's Blackstar.

15:49.114 --> 15:53.369
Today, we're all gonna learn exactly
how much you value your precious Code.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.996
-[gasps]
-Here's my jugular, Sampson.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.623
Clear shot for your eyes.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.298
Your son took a life
to save you and Gracie.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.050
[exhales deeply]

16:08.133 --> 16:10.636
[Blackstar] Can you do the same
to save your boy?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.472
Or does the Code come first,

16:13.555 --> 16:15.432
even before family?

16:15.933 --> 16:16.892
[gasps]

16:21.605 --> 16:23.899
I could've easily killed you
the first time

16:23.983 --> 16:26.235
had the Utopian not stepped in.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.028
But he won't save you this time.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.154
[grunting]

16:30.030 --> 16:32.408
-[yells]
-You hit like a girl.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.243
[all grunting]

16:34.326 --> 16:36.120
-Grace?
-So do I!

16:36.203 --> 16:37.997
-[grunting]
-[yells]

16:39.081 --> 16:41.041
Grace, you shouldn't be here.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.086
[panting] No.
This is… is my fault. It's all my fault.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.671
How do we get out of here?

16:45.754 --> 16:46.714
-[screams]
-Grace!

16:53.220 --> 16:54.304
[chuckles]

16:55.139 --> 16:57.141
An oldie but a goody.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.729
[breathing raggedly]

17:04.606 --> 17:05.774
You kill me,

17:06.483 --> 17:10.237
and everyone loses faith
in you and the Union.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.409
Uphold your Code, and you lose your son

17:16.076 --> 17:18.537
and the faith
of all the young kids in tights

17:18.620 --> 17:21.874
who are ready to leave you
and the Union behind.

17:21.957 --> 17:22.875
[exhales deeply]

17:27.087 --> 17:28.338
Wow, Shelly.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.343
Your kid didn't hesitate
to save you and good old Mom.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.806
[breathing raggedly]

17:45.856 --> 17:47.483
I don't think he's picking you, kid.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.693
-[grunts]
-[Blackstar] Nice knowing you.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.694
Dad!

17:51.487 --> 17:52.362
[grunts]

17:53.072 --> 17:54.448
[yells]

17:54.531 --> 17:55.657
[both grunting]

18:00.079 --> 18:01.914
-[yells]
-[grunts]

18:04.958 --> 18:08.087
Oh, not so tough on your own, are you?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.797
[both grunting]

18:12.007 --> 18:13.509
Last time I saw you,

18:14.343 --> 18:20.849
you and my so-called friends
beat me to a pulp while my son watched.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.897
You know, there'd be no Union

18:26.980 --> 18:29.483
if I hadn't stood up
for Sheldon and his crazy visions.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.692
None of you believed in them.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.405
And yet I'm on the outside?

18:36.323 --> 18:37.658
I'm the bad guy?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.371
You know, I think it's time
to settle old debts, hmm?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.665
[gun clatters to ground]

18:45.749 --> 18:47.084
For turning the Union against me.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.127
[yells]

18:48.752 --> 18:49.628
[groans]

18:49.711 --> 18:52.256
[George] It'd be too easy to kill you now.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.967
Let me show you how it all ends,

18:55.926 --> 18:59.680
and know that
there is nothing you can do about it.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.473
[yelling]

19:03.976 --> 19:05.060
-[yells]
-[grunts]

19:08.522 --> 19:09.398
[grunting]

19:14.361 --> 19:17.281
[Sheldon] He's not even close
to being ready. Maybe he never will be.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.825
-[yells]
-[grunts]

19:25.205 --> 19:26.081
[Sheldon] Brandon!

19:27.583 --> 19:28.709
[groans]

19:29.376 --> 19:30.252
[gasps]

19:40.137 --> 19:41.054
[grunts]

19:47.269 --> 19:48.270
[exhales deeply]

19:52.649 --> 19:53.567
[grunts]

19:54.443 --> 19:55.319
[panting]

20:00.032 --> 20:01.658
I wasn't gonna let you die.

20:05.913 --> 20:06.997
I know, Dad.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.176
[dramatic music playing]

20:22.554 --> 20:23.639
-[gasping]
-[coughs]

20:27.017 --> 20:27.851
They're out.

20:27.935 --> 20:28.936
[panting]

20:30.604 --> 20:31.480
[Grace gasping]

20:32.272 --> 20:33.774
Welcome back, old man.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.485
You owe me a million bucks.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.402
[panting]

20:38.153 --> 20:40.364
[Grace pants]

20:41.073 --> 20:42.032
Hey.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.620
Thank you, princess.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.667
[Fitz] You two done hugging it out?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.254
What the hell did you see in there?

20:57.297 --> 20:58.507
Skyfox.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.721
Blood pressure's elevated. Heart rate too.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.599
Otherwise, looks like you're okay.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.268
Thanks, Doc.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.481
Skyfox sent you a message, didn't he?
That's why he let us go.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.277
What was it?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.236
[sighs]

21:19.987 --> 21:21.738
I should tell Sheldon first.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.573
Well, if it affects Sheldon,
it affects me.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.910
-Grace--
-Walter. Show me.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.454
[sighs]

21:35.335 --> 21:37.045
-[grunts]
-[ethereal tinkling]

21:59.401 --> 22:00.402
[gasps]

22:01.778 --> 22:02.696
What was that?

22:05.198 --> 22:08.577
George cloned Blackstar

22:09.244 --> 22:12.164
knowing that he'd give the Union
the most trouble.

22:14.583 --> 22:19.379
Once I was in Blackstar's brain,
it was an ambush.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.466
He thought I'd be alone.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.764
He's coming for all of us.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.184
That's not gonna happen.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.895
-Don't underestimate him.
-[Grace] I won't.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.689
But if he thinks
he's gonna come for my family,

22:37.773 --> 22:39.274
he's got another thing coming.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.359
Grace…

22:40.984 --> 22:42.944
We will bring him to justice.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.700
[siren blaring]

23:02.547 --> 23:03.632
[Chloe] Jesus!

23:08.178 --> 23:14.017
I thought this was where you kept
all your drugs and guns and shit.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.603
I keep my drugs in the nightstand.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.439
Don't really need a gun.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.699
[Chloe] So, what is this?

23:29.783 --> 23:34.913
Like, some kind of comic-book superweapon?

23:36.706 --> 23:39.000
Somebody told me
the power cell could punch a hole

23:39.084 --> 23:40.794
through the strongest being on the planet.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.510
You're gonna use it against my dad?

23:52.597 --> 23:54.391
I'm gonna use it to find mine.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.394
And then what?

24:02.023 --> 24:05.318
[Fitz] No, I'm serious.
We all hacked our way through that jungle

24:05.402 --> 24:08.029
and made it through those tests
or whatever. We all did that.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.657
-[George] Oh God. You're still on this?
-[Fitz] I wanna know.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.868
How come he's the only one
who gets a cosmic rod thingy?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.661
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:14.744 --> 24:15.704
Power Rod.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.746
[scoffs]

24:16.830 --> 24:18.248
That's what you named it?

24:18.331 --> 24:20.834
-Well, it's a rod, and it's powerful.
-[chuckles]

24:20.917 --> 24:23.170
You know what they say
about men who talk about their rods?

24:23.253 --> 24:25.297
-[chuckles]
-[George chuckles]

24:25.380 --> 24:27.257
-What do they say, actually?
-[Fitz] Come on.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.759
-No, really, what do they say?
-We can all fly.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.679
-We're all crazy strong and fast, right?
-[Grace] Mm-hmm.

24:33.263 --> 24:36.016
But you get that thing. How's that fair?

24:36.099 --> 24:38.310
Wait. Hold on. Hold on. [inhales deeply]

24:38.894 --> 24:40.687
I'm the only one that got one

24:41.229 --> 24:43.064
because all you other assholes
weren't worthy.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.566
-Oh, you… Shit!
-That's what it says.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.276
-I promise. That's what it says.
-I'm not?

24:46.359 --> 24:49.070
All right, all right,
let's all gather around the table.

24:49.154 --> 24:52.407
-Let's watch the swearing, please.
-Yes, gentlemen, watch the shit you say.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.702
I got first choice of seats.

24:55.785 --> 24:56.620
Chair.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.832
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-[all laughing]

25:00.916 --> 25:02.334
I just… I guess you're not worthy.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.127
-[chuckles]
-[Fitz] That's funny.

25:04.211 --> 25:07.506
Your little magic wand better think twice
if it says I'm not worthy again.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.007
That goes for me too. [chuckles]

25:09.090 --> 25:12.219
Because we've both heard that
more than all of you combined.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.138
Trust me, I get it.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.890
Look, we're all worthy.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.809
If we weren't,
our bones would still be on that island

25:19.893 --> 25:21.728
with all the others who tried and failed.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.648
-[Grace] That's assuming an awful lot.
-[Sheldon] How so?

25:24.731 --> 25:30.195
I just think the real question is, "Why?"
Why did they give us these powers at all?

25:30.278 --> 25:33.448
So we could rule the world obviously.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.162
Oh, can no one in this room take a joke?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.956
-[all laughing]
-[Walter] Jeez.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.123
[Grace] You're the worst.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.168
Seriously, though,
we could do a lot of good.

25:45.752 --> 25:49.381
-We could get this country back on track.
-More than crooked politicians, anyway.

25:49.464 --> 25:53.510
[Sheldon] We don't govern,
and we don't kill. That's the Code.

25:53.593 --> 25:56.680
That's not just our values.
That's our system of checks and balances

25:56.763 --> 25:59.933
so that nobody here can even think
about ruling the world.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.228
I can't imagine
anyone in this room susceptible to that.

26:03.311 --> 26:04.688
[all chuckling]

26:05.564 --> 26:09.067
[Sheldon] Hey, America's in trouble.
I think we can all agree on that, right?

26:09.150 --> 26:10.777
It's teetering on the edge.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.656
But we've been given these amazing gifts.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.994
How do we use them
to help our country get back on its feet?

26:21.413 --> 26:22.622
[sighs gently]

26:33.258 --> 26:37.095
You could've sent me a psychic thank-you.
I'd get the sentiment just fine.

26:37.637 --> 26:40.890
I'd be trapped in Blackstar's brain
if it wasn't for you.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.894
I felt showing my gratitude
deserved a vis-à-vis.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.023
[Raikou] You wanna show your appreciation?

26:48.857 --> 26:51.776
Deposit my money
into the account by tomorrow morning.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.450
You're just like your mother.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.329
To the point.

27:03.538 --> 27:04.789
No bullshit.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.542
Sounds like you really liked her.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.543
Yeah.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.004
I did.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.757
But you didn't love her…

27:15.175 --> 27:18.428
because that would require communication,
commitment.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.264
Something we never had.

27:22.974 --> 27:23.933
That's on me.

27:26.186 --> 27:29.022
I wasn't around.
I take full responsibility.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.233
This mean
you're gonna send me birthday cards now?

27:32.317 --> 27:34.527
Are we really gonna be daddy and daughter?

27:35.779 --> 27:37.697
Hey, what do you want me to say?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.658
"I'm sorry"?

27:40.575 --> 27:41.618
"I made a mistake"?

27:42.202 --> 27:44.120
I don't want you to say another word.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.834
[ethereal tinkling]

27:52.879 --> 27:55.090
Oh, too late, dear.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.595
You know proximity allows us
to read minds much better.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.015
I have nothing to hide.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.647
[Walter] I understand your confidence…

28:12.065 --> 28:15.819
given the psychic trenches
and diversions you've framed…

28:16.986 --> 28:18.488
but they're grade-school.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.825
[Sheldon] Oh, don't get too comfortable.

28:23.576 --> 28:24.452
[chuckles softly]

28:27.247 --> 28:29.207
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:29.708 --> 28:33.461
Don't treat me like a fucking palm reader!

28:34.421 --> 28:36.548
[Sheldon] I'm so glad
you're okay, Brother.

28:36.631 --> 28:39.467
Oh, I didn't know if I'd see you again.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.971
All I know is that you cloned Blackstar

28:43.054 --> 28:46.307
and made it look
like Skyfox was behind the whole thing.

28:47.642 --> 28:48.893
[Sheldon] I heard about everything.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.021
-[sighs]
-I heard about Skyfox.

28:52.605 --> 28:55.483
Yeah. I heard about Blackstar.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.944
Yeah, well, we think
that George might be behind that as well.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.279
We found some…

29:00.029 --> 29:04.242
some tech in the lock of his cell
with his signature all over it.

29:04.325 --> 29:05.160
[sighs]

29:05.243 --> 29:06.661
[Walter] What about Blackstar's cell?

29:07.245 --> 29:08.455
You found a way to release him,

29:09.122 --> 29:14.169
knowing everyone would be attending to you
and your fight with Skyfox.

29:15.003 --> 29:18.465
Everyone except for the Utopian
and Paragon.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.217
[Walter] And why would I do such a thing?

29:21.301 --> 29:24.137
You wanna split apart the Utopian
from his son.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.014
All I know is we're here.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.476
You made a decision. We're here.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.020
Nothing can change that.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.567
[Raikou] That creates
instability within the Union,

29:38.193 --> 29:41.404
instability that will force
new leadership.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.076
What is it?

29:56.211 --> 29:57.212
[Walter sniffs]

30:00.632 --> 30:03.343
This country is spiraling out of control…

30:05.386 --> 30:08.389
thanks to Sheldon's
laissez-faire attitude.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.186
And there's no one else to blame.

30:14.145 --> 30:17.690
I might actually need your help… [sighs]

30:17.774 --> 30:19.025
…on another matter.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.444
Of course.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.197
It's Brandon.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.702
What is it? Is he okay?

30:33.581 --> 30:35.542
I'm afraid I might be losing him.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.465
You want me to talk to him?

30:45.635 --> 30:49.138
I… I… I can't lose him.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.395
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose him
like I lost Chloe. I…

30:55.478 --> 30:57.063
[inhales deeply]

30:57.146 --> 30:58.106
I can't.

30:58.898 --> 30:59.732
Hey.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.027
Whatever it takes…

31:04.487 --> 31:06.573
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.033
I don't give a shit

31:10.243 --> 31:12.495
about the Union or America.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.375
But… [sighs] …if you want me
to keep quiet about this,

31:18.710 --> 31:21.379
50 mil is my price.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.342
Will that really buy your silence?

31:26.968 --> 31:27.927
Hmm?

31:28.928 --> 31:31.639
Or can someone else buy you
for a higher price?

31:33.933 --> 31:35.143
You can trust me.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.815
[Walter] You can trust me.

31:41.691 --> 31:42.650
I promise.

31:47.238 --> 31:51.451
I never wanted to bring you in,
but Grace didn't give me a choice.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.871
And then I thought maybe you'd be smart,

31:55.580 --> 31:57.165
maybe you'd come over to my side.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.543
But no, you're a disappointment,

32:01.544 --> 32:03.004
just like everyone else.

32:06.799 --> 32:09.135

-[ethereal tinkling]

32:11.429 --> 32:13.514
I could've taught you so much.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.018
[ethereal tinkling intensifies]

32:36.371 --> 32:38.790
[melancholy music playing]
