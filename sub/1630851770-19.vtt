AND AS FOR YOU,

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
IF THIS JOB IS
TRULY IMPORTANT TO YOU,

26:39.685 --> 26:41.861
FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.993
DON'T LET ANYBODY
TELL YOU IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

26:44.037 --> 26:46.082
'CAUSE NOTHING IS.

26:48.258 --> 26:51.392
ASHER: SO APPARENTLY
I'M YOUR COACH
IN THE FUTURE.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.699
THEN I WANT
TO BE TRADED.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.398
LOOK, I'M OVER THIS
MURDER MYSTERY THING,

26:57.441 --> 26:59.530
BUT JJ STILL CARES,
AND HE GAVE ME A CLUE

26:59.574 --> 27:01.620
FOR THE BOTH OF US,
SO LET'S READ IT
AND MOVE ON, YEAH?

27:01.663 --> 27:03.665
FINE. OPEN IT.

"HOBBS & SHAW."

27:08.801 --> 27:11.412

"HOBBS & SHAW,"

DIFFERENT DATE.
SPENCER: THAT'S IT?

27:13.327 --> 27:15.677
UH, THERE'S A PHOTO
AND A LETTER.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.548
HERE.

27:17.592 --> 27:20.551
IT'S ME, YOU,
JORDAN, AND JJ.

27:20.595 --> 27:23.076
IT'S A LETTER FROM ME
TO YOU IN THE FUTURE,

27:23.119 --> 27:25.078
ASKING YOU
TO COME PLAY FOR ME.

27:25.121 --> 27:28.168
"I KNOW WE HAVEN'T
SPOKEN IN 8 YEARS."

27:28.211 --> 27:30.431
SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN
IN TWO YEARS.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.433
THIS SAYS,
"WAS IT EVER REAL?"

27:32.476 --> 27:34.696
WAS WHAT EVER REAL--
OUR FRIENDSHIP?

27:34.740 --> 27:37.960
IF I'M BEING HONEST,
JJ KINDA NAILED EXACTLY
HOW I'VE BEEN FEELING.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.962
YOU FEEL LIKE
OUR FRIENDSHIP AIN'T REAL?

27:40.006 --> 27:42.051
NOT IF YOU CAN TURN IT
ON AND OFF SO EASILY.

27:42.095 --> 27:45.185
- YOU BETRAYED ME, MAN.
- AND YOU'VE NEVER BETRAYED ME?

27:45.228 --> 27:48.188
LET'S REVISIT
OUR FRIENDSHIP
AGAIN, SHALL WE?

27:48.231 --> 27:51.191
JJ: UH, GUYS, CAN YOU
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION
IN FRONT OF

27:51.234 --> 27:53.759
THE OTHER GUESTS?
IT'S KIND OF
A PIVOTAL SCENE,

27:53.802 --> 27:56.631
AND YOU SHOULD
REALLY BE WEARING THE
MUSTACHE I PROVIDED.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.633
YOU STOLE
MY GIRLFRIEND, MAN--

27:58.677 --> 28:00.635
NOT ONCE, TWICE;
TWO TIMES,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.593
TWO DIFFERENT GIRLS.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.117
YOU ALSO STOLE MY SPOT
ON THE TEAM.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.988
OK, SO NOW YOU WANT
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION?

28:06.032 --> 28:08.425
FIRST OF ALL, MAYBE THEY
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SO EASY TO STEAL

28:08.469 --> 28:11.080
IF YOU DIDN'T CHEAT
ON ONE AND SLUT-SHAME
THE OTHER AT HOMECOMING!

28:11.124 --> 28:13.082
RIGHT, 'CAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
CHEATED ON YOUR GIRL?

28:13.126 --> 28:15.084
YOU'VE NEVER MADE YOUR GIRL
FEEL LIKE CRAP?

28:15.128 --> 28:18.000
AND SECOND OF ALL, I
DIDN'T STEAL YOUR SPOT,
HOMIE, I TOOK IT.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.437
IT AIN'T MY FAULT I WAS
JUST BETTER THAN YOU.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.439
THERE IT IS.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.659
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE--
SPENCER JAMES

28:24.703 --> 28:26.835
IS JUST BETTER THAN ME.
YOU ARE ALWAYS THE HERO,

28:26.879 --> 28:29.229
I'M ALWAYS THE VILLAIN, RIGHT?
SPENCER: NOBODY SAID THAT.

28:29.272 --> 28:31.448
NOBODY SAID THAT.
ASHER: OK, ALL RIGHT.
JJ: GUYS, GUYS, SORRY.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.450
WHEW! UH, IS IT
TOO MUCH TO ASK

28:33.494 --> 28:35.452
FOR YOU
TO START OVER IN
THE LIVING ROOM?

28:35.496 --> 28:38.064
'CAUSE I HAVE
EVERYONE GATHERED,
AND I PROMISE,

28:38.107 --> 28:41.067
IT PAYS OFF IN THE END.
ASHER: I ALREADY KNOW WHO
DID IT, JJ. IT WAS SPENCER.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.504
YOU MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING
THAT HE WANTED, TOO,

28:43.547 --> 28:46.159
'CAUSE HE'LL STAB ANYONE IN
THE BACK, EVEN HIS FRIENDS,

28:46.202 --> 28:48.509
TO GET WHAT HE WANTS.

28:49.945 --> 28:52.078
CASE SOLVED.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.563
HEY. ANYTHING?

28:59.607 --> 29:01.087
NOPE.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.002
NO SHUSHING SOUNDS,
HUH?

29:03.045 --> 29:06.396
- NO, OUR LIBRARIAN MUST
HAVE WENT HOME EARLY.
- WELL...

29:06.440 --> 29:09.008

DID YOU SEE THAT?

- AMINA?
- [SIGHS]

29:17.364 --> 29:19.322
- WHY IS YOUR DAUGHTER HERE?
- [SCOFFS]

29:19.366 --> 29:22.151
I PROMISED HER WE'D GO
TO THE HAUNTED HAYRIDE,

29:22.195 --> 29:24.153
THEN YOU MADE ME
COME HERE INSTEAD.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.894
I DIDN'T MAKE HIM COME.
HE--

29:25.938 --> 29:27.940
HE GOT A MINI-FRIDGE
OUT OF IT. TELL HER.

29:27.983 --> 29:30.725
I TOLD HER SHE CAN BE
A HALLWAY MONSTER
FOR HALLOWEEN.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.641
[SIGHS]
SO IT WAS YOU
THIS WHOLE NIGHT?

29:33.684 --> 29:34.860
WAS I SCARY?

29:34.903 --> 29:36.513

29:38.951 --> 29:41.475
COME ON. WE ALL--
Y'ALL GET OUTTA HERE.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.477
YOU CAN TAKE
THIS LITTLE MONSTER

29:43.520 --> 29:45.479
ON YOUR HAUNTED HAYRIDE.
GRACE IS HERE.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.394
I'LL STILL GET
THE MINI-FRIDGE?

29:47.437 --> 29:49.483
MM-HMM.
YOU EARNED IT.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.572
GOOD. COME ON.

29:53.226 --> 29:56.098
- PREACH.
- HMM?

29:56.142 --> 29:58.622
THANKS.

30:01.712 --> 30:04.672
NEW CLUE. INTERESTED?

30:04.715 --> 30:06.805
SURE.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.808
WELL, THERE SEEMS TO BE
A RUNNING THEME HERE:
NONE OF US ARE FRIENDS

30:09.851 --> 30:14.290
AND, IN FACT, YOU AND I
HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN 8 YEARS,
WHICH IS KINDA DEPRESSING.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.902
I MEAN, MAYBE NOT.

30:16.945 --> 30:19.861
HEH! OK. YEAH, MAYBE
I HAD THAT ONE COMING.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.037
SO ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHY YOU'VE BEEN SUCH AN ASS

30:22.081 --> 30:24.170
AND GHOSTING ME SINCE
YOUR BREAK-UP WITH SIMONE?

30:24.213 --> 30:26.825
- LAYLA, I HAVEN'T
BEEN GHOSTING YOU.
- JORDAN, COME ON.

30:26.868 --> 30:29.131
LIKE, WE GOT REALLY CLOSE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE THERE

30:29.175 --> 30:31.438
FOR EACH OTHER,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU WEREN'T THERE ANYMORE.

30:31.481 --> 30:34.049
- I TOLD YOU,
I'VE JUST BEEN--
- BUSY WITH FOOTBALL.

30:34.093 --> 30:37.052
OK, YOU CAN GO
WITH THAT, OR,
YOU KNOW,

30:37.096 --> 30:40.055
MAYBE YOU BLAME ME
FOR YOUR BREAK-UP
WITH SIMONE.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.928
- I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR THAT.
- DOES SHE?

30:48.455 --> 30:50.196
ANY VANDALIZATION
HAPPENING?

30:50.239 --> 30:53.025
UH, NO, BUT I
DID FIND THE, UH,

30:53.068 --> 30:56.245
THE SHADOWY HALLWAY

TERRORIZING ME ALL NIGHT.

ASKED HIM WHY HE WASN'T
WITH HER ON HALLOWEEN.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.211

BEEN PLAYING ME
THIS WHOLE TIME, HUH?

UH, LISTEN, UM...

31:10.259 --> 31:13.045
GRACE, YOU KNOW
THAT I WON'T GET
THE SCHOOL BOARD VOTES

31:13.088 --> 31:16.744
IF YOU MOVE AWAY TO OAKLAND.
GRACE: BILLY, I CAN'T FACTOR
THAT INTO MY DECISION.

31:16.787 --> 31:19.312
I KNOW.
I ACTUALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD GO.

31:19.355 --> 31:20.966
- WHAT?
- YEAH. GRACIE, I HAVEN'T SEEN

31:21.009 --> 31:23.098
YOU LIKE THIS SINCE
HIGH SCHOOL, COREY.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.318

DON'T COME AROUND OFTEN,

TO WORRY ABOUT DILLON.

NEW TRADITIONS THERE
FOR HIS OWN KIDS.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.370

31:41.203 --> 31:43.379
UH, IF THIS JOB IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME,

31:43.423 --> 31:45.816
THEN I'D FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN,

31:45.860 --> 31:50.038
NOT LET ANYBODY TELL ME
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE NOTHING IS.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.040
AMINA WASN'T
THE ONLY SECRET

31:52.084 --> 31:55.043

FROM YOU TONIGHT.

VOTED LAST NIGHT.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.795

32:07.838 --> 32:10.537
I ASKED THEM
IF I COULD TELL YOU.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.757
SO Y'ALL WANTED
TO TORTURE ME
A LITTLE BIT FIRST, HUH?

32:13.801 --> 32:15.585
HAD TO.
IT'S HALLOWEEN.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.761
WAIT. DOES THIS MEAN
THERE AIN'T NO VANDAL?

32:17.805 --> 32:20.373
OH, NO,
THAT'S VERY REAL.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.505

I JUST HIT SEND.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.606
IT IS NOT WHAT
MY EDITOR ASKED FOR,

32:36.650 --> 32:39.609
AGAIN, BUT...
HOPEFULLY SHE LIKES IT.

I'M SURE IT'S GREAT.

SOMEWHERE AND TALK?

GOING TO BED MAD.

TO REVEAL WHO DID IT,

WAS WHEN YOU WERE ALL

34:23.017 --> 34:25.585
