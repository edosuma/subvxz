-[muffled conversation]

00:09.843 --> 00:10.802
[door opens]

00:10.885 --> 00:13.013
You're like a little rock in my shoe.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.890
I shake my foot,
I think I've gotten it out,

00:15.974 --> 00:18.393
then dang, there it is again.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.021
Maybe watch where you're steppin'.

00:21.104 --> 00:24.190
That little rock on the back of my heel
makes me want to crush it.

00:24.899 --> 00:25.817
[JJ] Okay.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.779
Unlawful discharge of a firearm.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.366
Trespass on protected habitat.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.994
Felony destruction of property.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.246
All in the last two weeks.
You're on a roll, chief.

00:38.329 --> 00:41.082
If you think I'm gonna rat anybody out,
you got the wrong idea.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.376
I know your little teen brain
doesn't like to think ahead,

00:43.460 --> 00:46.880
but I want you to come with me
to uncharted territory.

00:47.922 --> 00:48.923
The future.

00:49.007 --> 00:53.678
How you gonna feel six months from now,
sittin' in juvenile prison in Wadesboro?

00:58.558 --> 00:59.476
You know these two?

01:04.189 --> 01:07.275
My question was, do you know these two?

01:13.114 --> 01:14.115
They...

01:16.242 --> 01:18.870
they broke into John B's house, and...

01:20.663 --> 01:23.875
then chased us through the marsh.
Other than that, I have no idea.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.752
[Peterkin] Here's a more recent photo.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.298
Somebody gaffed them,
then used them for chum.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.300
-Whatcha think, bull shark?
-[retching]

01:33.551 --> 01:35.053
[Peterkin] Here's the bad news, chief.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.555
Whoever killed these two men
is still out there,

01:37.972 --> 01:41.309
and I got reason to believe
their next target is a friend of yours...

01:41.392 --> 01:42.519
John B.

01:42.936 --> 01:47.690
You kids don't think you're the only ones
after the Royal Merchant now, do you?

01:48.233 --> 01:49.442
And, yeah.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.277
I know about that, too.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.493
Okay, Sheriff Peterkin,
I can promise you he's not on it anymore.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.621
So you say.
I'm just tryin' to keep him safe.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.916
I want you to tell your friend John B
to come in and talk to me,

02:04.999 --> 02:07.752
and let's see if we can keep you
out of Wadesboro.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.384
How'd it go?

02:15.468 --> 02:17.303
Hopefully, he's not as dumb as he looks.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.764
Set up some eyes on the Routledge place.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.015
Maybe we'll get lucky.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.977
Stealth mode on.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.565
-[Luke sighs]
-[officer mutters]

02:28.648 --> 02:31.109
-You his guardian?
-Sorry to say, I'm his father.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.944
[officer]
Well, hearing will be in two weeks.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.029
If you fail to show up,
you will forfeit your bail.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.449
The restitution will be based on
the average of three outside estimates

02:38.533 --> 02:40.660
-of the cost of the damaged article.
-Restitution?

02:40.743 --> 02:43.121
Pay for what he broke.
It's part of the plea.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.208
Yeah, and... sign right here, please.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.421
[Luke] Let's go. Go now!

02:54.966 --> 02:58.553
I wonder what restitution's gonna be
on a 2019 Malibu.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.390
-I'll pay it off. All of it. I swear, Dad.
-Shit. 30K?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.560
When you gonna clear that, big guy,

03:06.186 --> 03:09.314
when all you do is smoke weed
and hang out on the south side?

03:10.690 --> 03:11.566
Huh?

03:12.901 --> 03:13.860
Get in the car.

03:17.822 --> 03:18.740
Let's go.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.127
Dad, I swear--

03:31.211 --> 03:32.170
[grunts] No!

03:33.713 --> 03:35.840
Thirty thousand dollars!

03:35.924 --> 03:38.134
Do you know what you did to me?
Damn--

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
-[yelling]
-[JJ groaning]

03:43.097 --> 03:45.433
[rock music playing on radio]

03:45.516 --> 03:47.101
[Luke] How you gonna get
that money back?

03:47.185 --> 03:49.187
[growls]

03:49.270 --> 03:51.940
-[Luke] By sittin' around doin' nothin'?
-[breathing heavily]

03:53.608 --> 03:54.734
I'm gonna tell you right now,

03:55.401 --> 03:58.613
you are a worthless piece of shit!

03:58.696 --> 04:00.156
-Shut up!
-[Luke] Your mama knew.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.074
Shut up!

04:01.824 --> 04:03.910
[Luke] You tell me where you're gonna get
30 grand now!

04:03.993 --> 04:05.620
-Get your ass in here!
-[grunts]

04:06.246 --> 04:07.413
[birdsong]

04:07.497 --> 04:09.082
[snoring]

04:10.917 --> 04:12.919
[breathing heavily]

04:43.324 --> 04:44.575
[Luke continues snoring]

04:51.624 --> 04:53.042
[gun cocks]

05:01.467 --> 05:02.635
[sobs]

05:04.637 --> 05:06.639
[engine revving]

05:28.953 --> 05:30.204
[sighs]

05:30.830 --> 05:32.665
Hey, you sure you want me
to drop you at school?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.459
-What?
-I thought they gave you the boot.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.502
-[John B] Nah, this is the right place.
-[chuckles]

05:36.586 --> 05:38.171
-[John B] Thanks, homie.
-All right.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.630
-I'll see ya.
-[man] See ya.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.925
Yo, thanks for the ride! I owe you one.

05:47.347 --> 05:52.060
-Hell has frozen over.
-I guess it has. Uh...

05:53.019 --> 05:55.271
I couldn't stop thinkin'
about your class, Mr. Sunn.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.024
-You must need money.
-[John B] How much can you spare?

05:58.107 --> 06:00.151
Yeah, uh, sorry. Just kidding.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.696
Actually, I was going through
some of my father's stuff,

06:03.780 --> 06:06.032
and I, uh... I found this letter.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.826
It's from a local landowner.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.121
I was wondering
if you could translate it. Um...

06:12.205 --> 06:15.166
It-- it's in Gullah, and I remember that
from our local history unit.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.043
It's gratifying to know
some of it sunk in.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.628
-Yeah, some of it.
-[Mr. Sunn] Yeah...

06:18.711 --> 06:21.005
Even though you spent half the class
on a surf break.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.757
-[John B] Only the big swells.
-Oh.

06:23.758 --> 06:24.967
Yeah. Uh...

06:25.051 --> 06:27.095
-[Mr. Sunn] Yeah, it's...
-So, uh, the letter.

06:27.178 --> 06:31.224
Ah... dated... 1844.

06:31.307 --> 06:33.851
"To my beloved son Robert.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.770
I am awaiting the...

06:35.853 --> 06:39.941
[sighs] ...hour of my public murder

06:40.024 --> 06:43.611
with... great composure of mind

06:43.694 --> 06:47.490
and cheerfulness,
knowing I am soon bound for glory."

06:48.908 --> 06:50.076
He was lynched.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.873
"Do not nurse grief to vengeance,

06:55.957 --> 07:00.461
but instead trust in God
with all your heart,

07:00.545 --> 07:02.588
for He doeth all things well.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.924
Until we meet again in heaven,

07:05.007 --> 07:07.760
your loving father, Denmark Tanny."

07:07.844 --> 07:10.096
-So that's it?
-[Mr. Sunn] There's a postscript,

07:10.179 --> 07:12.348
but it's just a planter's log.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.184
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you read that for me, actually?

07:18.646 --> 07:23.317
"Matters applicable to the property
and the estate."

07:23.401 --> 07:27.113
Uh, "'bacca, cotton, corn, tomato.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.364
But lastly, to Robert..."

07:28.448 --> 07:29.615
That's his son. Yeah.

07:30.575 --> 07:35.872
"Harvest the wheat near the water
in parcel nine forthwith."

07:38.249 --> 07:39.250
That's it.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.044
On the day that he dies,

07:43.546 --> 07:46.716
he writes a letter to his son
telling him to harvest the wheat?

07:46.799 --> 07:48.551
It's a little odd, to be honest,

07:49.010 --> 07:50.011
but look...

07:56.642 --> 07:57.685
Mr. Sunn...

08:01.189 --> 08:04.400
I-- I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.070
You just...
you just helped me out so much.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.280
Thank you. Uh...

08:09.363 --> 08:13.242
I-- I hope you have a great summer,
and I'll see you this fall.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.243
Sorry.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.245
Whoo!

08:24.045 --> 08:25.588
[chickens clucking]

08:29.759 --> 08:32.553
[both grunting]

08:32.637 --> 08:35.389
It's me, JJ. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.350
-Fuck.
-[John B] What are you doing?

08:37.433 --> 08:38.434
[JJ] Shut up.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.478
[car door slams]

08:41.395 --> 08:43.898
[both panting]

08:46.025 --> 08:46.901
[JJ] See that?

08:48.444 --> 08:50.321
-They're watching us, okay?
-Who?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.783
I don't know. Let's go.
Sneak around to the dock.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.409
Gotta go this way.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.876
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got the keys to the <i>Pogue?</i>

09:03.960 --> 09:04.835
Yeah.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.449
John, hurry up.
Come on, come on, come on.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.412
[engine starts]

09:45.918 --> 09:47.670
Let's catch us a fish.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.797
[sighs]

10:25.207 --> 10:27.335
I appreciate your help in the past,

10:29.712 --> 10:31.297
but we even now.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.258
From now on, I do my job.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.095
I wanted you to know.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.312
[JJ] First, I almost get
strangled to death by Kooks,

10:46.395 --> 10:48.147
and now I'm on the hook for 30 grand.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.900
-We should just dip.
-Okay, where do you wanna go? Hm?

10:53.069 --> 10:53.903
Yucatan.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.656
-Yucatan.
-[JJ] No, I'm dead serious right now.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.326
Surf all day, and then we can just live
off lobsters we catch with our bare hands.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.411
You just wanna leave
'cause you got your ass beat?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.746
You didn't see the photos.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.873
Think about it.
They're willing to kill for the gold,

11:05.956 --> 11:08.250
-then it's gotta be out there.
-Have you lost your mind?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.752
One hundred years, man.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.546
One hundred years, people have been tryin'
to find this Royal Merchant,

11:12.630 --> 11:13.714
and no one succeeded.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.300
And you think you are gonna be
the one that actually finds it?

11:16.759 --> 11:18.386
When will you get it in your thick skull?

11:18.469 --> 11:21.305
If you keep goin' down this road,
you're gonna end up just like your dad!

11:21.389 --> 11:22.598
[John B] I can't give up, JJ!

11:22.682 --> 11:25.601
The last time I saw that dude,
we got in an argument,

11:28.312 --> 11:31.649
and then he took all of our rent money
and dipped for this Royal Merchant.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.319
And then I told him he was a shit father,

11:37.029 --> 11:38.864
and you know how
the rest of the story goes.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.828
-[JJ] Bro, that wasn't your fault.
<i>-</i>It doesn't matter whose fault it is, JJ!

11:44.245 --> 11:45.621
Do you not understand that?

11:47.873 --> 11:49.959
I can't give up on the hunt, man.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.212
I don't care who's out there,
who's gonna try to kill us.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.338
Do you understand that?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.091
You know that.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.308
Look, I've got a plan. You comin' or what?

12:12.398 --> 12:13.858
Four hundred million, JJ.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.778
How much do you owe in restitution?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.832
-[Wheezie] You're not dressed?
-No, I'm not going.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.625
I mean, it's Midsummers.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.378
You've been talking about Midsummers
since last year.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.589
-You have a date, remember?
-Yes, I remember.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.549
Sarah says she's not going.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.009
[Rose chuckles] The hell she isn't.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.220
Your father is being coronated as
Guardian of Knights of the Rhododendron.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.263
You're going.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.974
You're not my mother,
I don't have to do what you tell me.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.560
Whatever.
Your daughter says she's not going.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.437
-[Ward] Um...
-[sighs] She's off Topper, JoJo.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.440
[Ward] Wheezie, please. Go.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.692
Thank you very much. What's goin' on?

12:57.985 --> 13:02.948
I just... don't feel like Topper
is my splinter bean.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.202
I don't know exactly what that means,

13:06.285 --> 13:09.830
but it sounds to me
like you should probably dump his ass,

13:09.914 --> 13:10.831
maybe, huh?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.167
Probably.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.836
[Ward] Maybe just not tonight, though.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.714
-Maybe you could, I don't know--
-I just don't want to go with him.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.715
[Ward] I know, I know.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.259
What if you just paste on a smile

13:22.802 --> 13:25.137
and you go,
and we have a good time, all right?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.889
And you deal with your love life <i>mañana?</i>

13:27.556 --> 13:28.516
Please.

13:38.108 --> 13:42.238
I don't know what happened to Topper's
boat. Quite honestly, I don't want to.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.159
[woman] Band's supposed
to be right over here.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.703
You were two seconds away
from havin' a different life.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.080
You just about killed me.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.749
-[man] Chairs over here!
-[Heyward] It would have killed your mama.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.212
And you know the deal!

14:00.089 --> 14:01.715
One of these rich kids messes up,

14:02.424 --> 14:05.636
they'll still go to college
and meet another rich person.

14:07.972 --> 14:12.226
Then they'll make more rich kids,
who'll also get third and fourth chances.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.854
I know. I gotta do better. I get it.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.855
All right?

14:16.647 --> 14:21.026
You wanna... spend your whole life
grindin' it out like me?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.320
It's your grindin' keepin' us
afloat in the first place.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.198

Okay? There was this coded message,
and I-- I need the plat map.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.371
-Know what a plat map is?
-Yes.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.831
It's like a blueprint of Tannyhill.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.333
It's got all the information on it.
It's in your dad's office.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.378
-If I get in, I can find the gold--
-I said I know what a plat map is.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.546
Okay, that's fine!

23:45.924 --> 23:48.176
-[Topper] Hey, Sarah, is that you?
-Get down! Shit!

23:48.260 --> 23:50.220
Um... We've gotta get outta here.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.894
[John B] Meet at the Hawk's Nest
at midnight. Bring the map.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.065
[sighs] Oh, boy.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.359
[clears throat]

24:04.943 --> 24:06.236
[sighs]

24:07.571 --> 24:08.530
[clears throat]

24:10.365 --> 24:11.241
Hey.

24:15.036 --> 24:16.413
Sarah, what are you doin' out here?

24:17.372 --> 24:21.793
Oh, um... Scarlet told me she had hidden
some vodka or something.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.546
-[Topper] Oh, really? Scarlet's...
-Yeah, I couldn't find it though.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.756
[Topper] Is that who you were talkin' to
over there?

24:28.425 --> 24:29.759
I wasn't talking to anyone.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.345
Was I just seein' things?
I thought, like, I don't know,

24:32.429 --> 24:34.806
I was watching you have
a conversation over there.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.350
-Just...
-I was talking to people from the party.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.561
Hey, what's-- what's goin' on?
What's goin' on?

24:39.644 --> 24:42.647
I just feel like... I just feel like
you've been a little off tonight.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.191
-No, I'm fine.
-[Topper]<i> </i>No, you good?

24:44.274 --> 24:46.026
-I'm fine, Topper.
-Seriously. Seriously.

24:46.109 --> 24:47.736
-God!
-[Topper] I don't wanna make a scene.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.279
-Don't make a scene.
-I'm not--

24:49.362 --> 24:51.948
Just tell me what the hell is goin' on.
Just tell me the truth.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.784
-[Sarah] I am telling you the truth.
-Tell me-- No. Cut the shit.

24:54.868 --> 24:55.827
Just tell me the truth.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.872
Okay, fine. I can't handle
the constant interrogation, okay?

24:58.955 --> 24:59.956
[Topper] Just...

25:06.254 --> 25:09.883
[Rafe] Your face looks really bad.
Starting to look like your dad a lot more.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.676
-[spits]
-Oh, shit.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.137
-All right. It was--
-Gentlemen!

25:15.055 --> 25:16.181
-Is there a problem?
-[JJ] Oh!

25:16.264 --> 25:19.267
Pardon me, officer.
No, there's not an issue. I just--

25:19.351 --> 25:21.269
Actually, yes. No, there is an issue.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.773
Uh, we got a criminal trespass
in progress here.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.191
Beep! Call it in, right?

25:26.274 --> 25:28.860
-Blatant disrespect for private property.
-Yeah.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.904
I'm in violation
of all kinds of shit, sir,

25:30.987 --> 25:34.241
-but these young gentlemen...
-Don't touch my shit.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.952
...uh, caught me, sir,
and they're about to take me away.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.079
And that's what you should do,
escort me out of here.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.330
-You got me.
-[guard] Come on.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.998
All right. Fix that tie, son.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.334
You're lookin' spiffy, too.
You Powerpuff Girls have fun.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.336
Tell Kiara
she looks pretty hot for a Pogue.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.546
[grunts]

25:48.255 --> 25:50.131
[guard] Hey! Stop it. Come here! Let's go!

25:50.215 --> 25:51.049
Let's go!

25:51.132 --> 25:53.009
-[JJ] You think I'm afraid of you?
-Come on!

25:53.093 --> 25:55.387
-Come on.
-Hey, safe travels back to the cut.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.429
This ain't over!

25:56.513 --> 25:58.848
Hey, hey, it was really nice
seein' you again, JJ!

25:59.683 --> 26:02.018
[JJ] Look-- look, man, I can walk myself.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.020
-I got legs. Can you see that, brother?
-Come on.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.939
I really appreciate
what you did back there.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.440
Let me just walk out by myself.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.277
Mr. Dunleavy, I see you got your drink.
Good, that's really nice of you.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.695
I'm actually gonna down that.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.697
-What the hell's the matter with him?
-Sorry, sir.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.615
-[man] Security...
-[JJ] Aah! Whoo!

26:16.575 --> 26:19.661
I really appreciate the discretion,
Daryl, you know?

26:19.744 --> 26:21.580
It's okay, everybody! Do not panic.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.456
Leave it to the men and women in uniform.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.250
Let's hear it for them. Rose!

26:25.333 --> 26:26.751
You look like Lady Liberty.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.379
It's good to see you again.
Hey, buddy, can I have one of those?

26:29.462 --> 26:30.839
-Let go of him!
-Hey.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.757
-[Kie] You can't boot him!
-Excuse me, ma'am?

26:32.841 --> 26:34.384
-Really?
-I invited him here.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.595
-Kiara, stop it.
-I'm a member of this club.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.096
-[rock music plays]
-[guard grunts]

26:38.179 --> 26:39.723
-[commotion]
-[JJ] Sorry about that.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.558
Hey, mandatory power hour at Rixon's, Kie.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.310
Pope, you as well, all right?

26:43.393 --> 26:45.145
Rixon's Cove. Let's roll.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.855
All right, Kie, come on.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.315
Workers of the world unite.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.524
Throw off your chains!

26:49.608 --> 26:51.401
-You can't hang around these kids.
-I'm sorry--

26:51.484 --> 26:52.444
-No. Kiara!
-Hey, Kiara!

26:52.527 --> 26:54.029
-Whoo-hoo!
-[JJ] Colonel.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.572
-Captain.
-Mission accomplished, sir.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.240
No, Pope... Don't, Pope...

26:59.576 --> 27:01.369
-[JJ] Come on, Kie.
-Enough of this, son.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.248
Don't do this. Don't do this!
Where the hell do you think you're goin'?

27:05.332 --> 27:06.875
[Kie laughing]

27:08.001 --> 27:09.044
Later, losers!

27:09.502 --> 27:10.503
[Kie] Whoo!

27:15.842 --> 27:17.427
[cicadas chirping]

27:18.970 --> 27:21.890
[Pope] Hey, guys.
So, like, my dad's already gonna kill me.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.933
So what's this mandatory meeting about?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.688
Might as well tell him, man,
before we're gaffed.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.567
-You ready for this?
-Yeah.

27:33.026 --> 27:37.155
So, the gold never went down
with the Royal Merchant.

27:37.238 --> 27:39.282
Oh, my God.<i> </i>Here we go again with this.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.660
No.<i> </i>All right, wait.
Hear him out, all right?

27:42.452 --> 27:43.953
It's been here the whole time.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.083
-It's on the island.
-Are you serious?

27:49.000 --> 27:49.959
Oh, my God.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.586
I'd like to voice my skepticism.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.380
[John B] I'm sure you would, Pope,

27:53.463 --> 27:56.800
but can I please present you
with my evidence, sir?

27:56.883 --> 27:57.926
Proceed.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.553
[John B] All right. So, in my backpack,

28:01.471 --> 28:03.890
-I have a letter from Denmark Tanny.
-Who the hell's that?

28:03.973 --> 28:07.268
Denmark Tanny was a slave
that survived the Royal Merchant wreck.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.895
-Check this out.
-[Kie] What?

28:09.187 --> 28:10.021
[John B] Here you go.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.982
Okay, slaves weren't mentioned
as crew members on the ship,

28:13.066 --> 28:15.151
but my dad,
he found the complete manifest.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.319
That was his big discovery.

28:16.403 --> 28:20.448
So Tanny used the gold
from the Merchant to buy his freedom.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.367
-[whistles]
-[John B] After that,

28:23.368 --> 28:24.327
he bought his farm.

28:24.744 --> 28:27.539
Drumroll, please, because that farm is...

28:27.622 --> 28:28.915
[slapping knees]

28:29.499 --> 28:30.583
Tannyhill Plantation.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.043
Tannyhill?

28:32.127 --> 28:35.714
Yeah. So, after that, he used his money
to free even more slaves,

28:35.797 --> 28:38.925
and then he sold a shit-ton of rice,
which pisses off all the white planters,

28:39.008 --> 28:41.261
and then they decide to lynch him.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.182
So on the day they were coming to get him,

28:47.016 --> 28:49.519
he writes a letter to his son
as a farewell,

28:49.602 --> 28:51.312
and in the last line of that letter,

28:51.396 --> 28:55.150
he leaves a coded message
about where to find the gold.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.111
-[whispers] Where?
-[John B] Harvest the wheat

28:58.194 --> 28:59.237
in parcel nine,

28:59.988 --> 29:00.822
near the water.

29:01.364 --> 29:04.075
Except... there's no wheat.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.537
You see, wheat is code for gold.
Check this out.

29:09.372 --> 29:12.292
The gold is in parcel nine,
near the water.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.710
[laughs]

29:13.793 --> 29:14.878
Holy shit.

29:14.961 --> 29:18.506
All we need is an original survey map
of the property,

29:18.590 --> 29:20.258
and we've found the gold.

29:20.341 --> 29:24.137
Okay, so this might have
a small chance of being actually true.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.765
-Dude, it's like King Tut.
-I am a genius. Hey, whoa!

29:26.848 --> 29:29.225
Hello! Fire! You're near the fire.
You're gonna burn.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.977
-I'm so proud of you right now.
-Thank you.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.396
-That's really sweet of you.
-[Pope] Okay, so, guys.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.440
-What's the plan?
-Good question.

29:35.523 --> 29:36.983
Sarah Cameron's coming tonight.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.277
-She'll bring an original survey map--
-[Kie] Hold on.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.654
Sarah? Wh-why Sarah?

29:41.738 --> 29:42.572
[John B] Um...

29:42.989 --> 29:44.032
This is gonna be good.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.200
Sarah, um, she--

29:45.283 --> 29:47.660
she got me into the archives
in Chapel Hill yesterday,

29:47.744 --> 29:49.078
and that's where I got the letter.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.456
You were in Chapel Hill
with Sarah Cameron?

29:51.539 --> 29:53.833
-Yeah, um--
-[JJ] He was mackin' on her.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.795
-I wasn't macking.
-You were totally macking Sarah Cameron.

29:56.878 --> 30:00.089
I wasn't macking on her, okay?
I was using her for access.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.884
-There was access, all right.
-Did you tell her about the treasure?

30:02.967 --> 30:05.386
-I was trying to get into the archives.
-[Kie] Is that a yes?

30:05.470 --> 30:07.764
-I-- I left out key details.
-[Kie] Yo, what?

30:07.847 --> 30:10.350
You let a Kook in on our secret?

30:10.433 --> 30:12.018
What about Pogue Lyfe?

30:12.101 --> 30:14.229
What about the T-shirt company, bro?

30:14.312 --> 30:15.980
I was just using her for information.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.732
Why don't I believe you?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.359
I'm trying to make us filthy rich here.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.569
Okay, so that we can pay off a boat,

30:21.653 --> 30:26.491
or-- or, uh... send you to autopsy school
to study dead bodies.

30:26.574 --> 30:27.742
Look, you guys know me.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.579
Do I look like the type of person
to fall for Sarah Cameron?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.498
-[JJ] Uh...
-Do you want us to answer that, or--

30:33.581 --> 30:37.794
-[John B] Just-- just stop.
-[Kie] Look, you don't know her yet. I do!

30:38.294 --> 30:39.712
You can't trust her.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.840
Her brother did hit me in the back
with a golf club.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.550
Rafe and Sarah are different human beings.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.426
What did she do to you, exactly?

30:45.510 --> 30:47.554
She's like a-- like a spitting cobra.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.765
-First, she-- she blinds you, and then--
-This is a bad analogy.

30:50.849 --> 30:51.683
Listen to me!

30:52.600 --> 30:55.562
Whatever we get, she's gonna try to take.

31:24.841 --> 31:25.884
[Ward] What are you doin'?

31:25.967 --> 31:30.388
I... just wanted a copy of
one of the old plat maps.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.516
A plat map. [laughs]

31:33.600 --> 31:35.393
-Of Tannyhill.
-Yeah.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.979
You never wanted to look at those
when I tried to show 'em to you.

31:38.062 --> 31:42.942
Well, since then, I have become
so appreciative of this beautiful property

31:43.026 --> 31:45.320
that we call home,
and they're so beautiful,

31:45.403 --> 31:49.240
I thought maybe I could get them framed
and hung in my room.

31:49.657 --> 31:52.535
Okay, come on, Sarah, seriously.
What is this, a school thing?

31:53.620 --> 31:54.662
No, it's July.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.040
-[Ward] A Topper thing?
-[sighs]

31:57.123 --> 31:58.583
It's not a Topper thing.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.336
But it is a boy thing.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.421
A boy thing.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.925
He's a real go-getter.
I think you'll like him.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.844
Hey, who is this mystery history buff?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.638
Is he a cartographer or somethin'?

32:13.556 --> 32:15.934
I could tell you, but then
he wouldn't be a mystery, would he?

32:16.017 --> 32:17.894
[laughs] Hey!

32:19.812 --> 32:20.688
Yes?

32:26.778 --> 32:27.987
Make good choices.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.157
I will.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.953
-[Ward] Be careful with that.
-Promise.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.037
[kisses]

32:36.245 --> 32:38.289
-Thank you. You're the best.
-[chuckles]

32:39.749 --> 32:40.959
[door closes]

32:47.924 --> 32:49.550
[sighs]

33:09.737 --> 33:11.739
[safe beeping]

33:12.865 --> 33:14.075
[lock clicks]

33:28.381 --> 33:29.632
[Ward sighs]

33:45.523 --> 33:48.609
You're better off without her, Top.
Trust me. I live with the bitch.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.738
Rafe, don't call your sister a bitch, man.
Come on.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.365
Yo, I'll call her whatever I want, man.
All right?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.784
-Come on, bro. Drink up, all right?
-Go!

33:56.868 --> 33:58.870
-[Kelce] Let's go. Just chill out, okay?

-If you go there now,

34:09.589 --> 34:11.340
there is a high likelihood you go fetal.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.634
-[Kelce] Exactly.
-I'm not-- I'm not going fetal.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.470

Are you gettin' them?

like, I would for sure, like,

I'm thinkin' about you when I wake up,
when I go to bed at night, like, it's--

35:58.072 --> 36:02.076
I-- I never knew love could make you
so anxious,

like something's off between us, like, I--

I need to talk to you, Sarah.

to stay here as a decoy.

About your little adventure,
about you running from the DCS,

about how you were protecting her
in the tower.

43:08.919 --> 43:11.005
John, I believe I owe you an apology.

43:13.465 --> 43:15.718
You were honest with me
about a small indiscretion,

43:15.801 --> 43:17.886
and I went ahead and fired you anyway.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.055
And I shouldn't have.

Unfortunately, from time to time,
I have a bit of a...

short fuse.

Ask her.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.398
It's true.

[Ward] I'd like to make up for it,
if you'll let me.

I spoke with Sheriff Peterkin, and...

43:36.614 --> 43:40.117
I've offered to be your legal guardian,
if you'll have me.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.535
[chuckles] What?

43:42.578 --> 43:45.998
