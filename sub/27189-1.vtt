Hi, Mikey.

03:35.104 --> 03:36.807
It is a zoo
at my house right now.

03:37.508 --> 03:38.509
Ninjas everywhere.

03:38.942 --> 03:39.944
You okay?

03:40.676 --> 03:41.745
I don't want to talk about it.

03:42.479 --> 03:43.481
Cool.

The Rangers lost last night.

How is it that the worst sport

03:49.552 --> 03:51.852
I can't believe
that you got this bag.

03:51.854 --> 03:53.554
It just makes it official.

03:53.556 --> 03:54.955
You guys are so Kim and Kanye.

03:54.957 --> 03:55.960
Thanks girl.

03:56.926 --> 03:58.763
You guys missed out.
The park was awesome.

03:59.062 --> 04:00.095
Got a bag of the A-list.

04:00.097 --> 04:01.566
Saw a couple of raccoons
doing it.

04:02.199 --> 04:03.701
- Doing what?
- Doing it.

04:04.168 --> 04:07.438

Okay, you guys stop.

04:11.508 --> 04:13.044
Raccoons fucking. That's funny.

04:15.012 --> 04:16.079
So who is down tonight?

04:16.512 --> 04:17.514
- Me.
- Obviously.

04:17.848 --> 04:18.850
I don't want to be a wheel.

04:19.817 --> 04:20.981
Oh, come on, Mikey.

04:20.983 --> 04:22.586
No, seriously. It sucks.

04:23.153 --> 04:24.588
Aw, baby Mikey.

04:24.987 --> 04:25.990
Shut up!

04:26.923 --> 04:28.158
I actually got to
see how my mom is doing.

04:28.826 --> 04:29.961
It's crazy
at my house right now.

04:30.761 --> 04:32.163
Can someone
please bring me a girl?

04:33.863 --> 04:34.865
Is anyone down to smoke?

04:46.476 --> 04:49.479
Yes, actions do
have consequences.

04:49.980 --> 04:52.617
So, when looking
at the story of Macbeth,

04:53.016 --> 04:54.951
not only as a tragedy,

04:55.252 --> 04:56.853
but also as a morality play,

04:57.721 --> 05:00.757
what can Macbeth tell us
about Avares today?

05:03.494 --> 05:04.495
What is Avares?

05:04.961 --> 05:06.096
Your mamma's pussy.

05:08.798 --> 05:09.800
Michael.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.265
Would you like to share
your ideas

05:11.267 --> 05:12.903
greed
with the rest of the class?

05:14.805 --> 05:15.807
Um...

05:16.774 --> 05:18.740
Come on. Don't sell yourself
short, Michael.

05:18.742 --> 05:20.711
I know you have opinions
about this, right?

05:22.745 --> 05:24.514
Yeah, of course I do.

05:24.982 --> 05:26.717
Would you like to share them?

05:28.619 --> 05:29.620
Macbeth?

05:30.521 --> 05:33.057
Greed, actions, consequences?

05:35.791 --> 05:36.793
Um...

05:39.028 --> 05:40.031
Well...

05:40.797 --> 05:41.866
In my opinion...

05:42.665 --> 05:43.935
I think it's all...

05:45.035 --> 05:46.604
You know, the wife's fault.

05:48.071 --> 05:49.170
I mean it was her idea

05:49.172 --> 05:50.808
to kill Duncan
in the first place.

05:51.173 --> 05:52.175
And then she's like,

05:53.142 --> 05:54.845
Oh,
I can't do it.

05:56.846 --> 05:59.046
He really looks
too much like my daddy.

06:00.016 --> 06:01.716
Alright, alright

06:01.718 --> 06:02.887
everybody that's enough.

06:06.857 --> 06:08.693
Interesting perspective,
Michael.

06:10.793 --> 06:13.230
Uh, and as for the greed thing,

06:15.031 --> 06:16.567
obviously, you know,

06:17.134 --> 06:19.267
it really motivates a lot
of the shady shit

06:19.269 --> 06:21.069
that's going down
in this school.

06:21.071 --> 06:22.570
- Ooh!
- Michael.

06:22.572 --> 06:23.774
Hey, that's enough.

06:25.309 --> 06:26.808
Alright, guys, so tomorrow

06:26.810 --> 06:28.676
remember, bring your proposals

06:28.678 --> 06:30.312
they are due
and that was a great class.

06:30.314 --> 06:31.249
Thank you all very much.

06:32.214 --> 06:33.647
Hey, Michael,
you want to stick around

06:33.649 --> 06:34.716
for a minute please?

06:34.718 --> 06:36.920
Ooh!

06:44.261 --> 06:45.897
- Are you still high?
- I don't know.

06:46.228 --> 06:48.296
I think, man.
I'm freaking out.

06:48.298 --> 06:49.731
It was a crazy week.

06:49.733 --> 06:51.869
Look at me.

06:52.735 --> 06:54.572
Alright, listen to me.
You're gonna be okay.

06:55.105 --> 06:56.637
We'll be on the other side
of that door.

06:56.639 --> 06:57.741
Just get through Shaw, alright?

06:58.074 --> 06:59.173
Yeah, cool.

06:59.175 --> 07:00.176
- Thanks.
- Alright.

07:11.088 --> 07:12.088
How is H holding up?

07:13.322 --> 07:14.324
Fine.

07:14.891 --> 07:15.893
So messed up.

07:17.124 --> 07:17.659
His dad stole all that money.

07:17.661 --> 07:19.196
Like three billion dollars
or something.

07:20.262 --> 07:21.730
Stole from his own people.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.833
Not just his own people.

07:25.101 --> 07:26.269
That is so gross.

07:27.637 --> 07:28.638
So gross.

07:35.211 --> 07:36.913
Suck my twat, Willa!

07:37.213 --> 07:39.050
God, I love you, Sessa.

07:39.783 --> 07:41.315
If we all got into trouble
for the actions

07:41.317 --> 07:42.319
of our parents,

07:42.952 --> 07:44.054
I'd be in jail right now.

07:48.925 --> 07:49.927
Hey, Donna.

07:50.293 --> 07:51.596
You know Mikey, right?

07:56.867 --> 07:57.867
Michael.

07:59.069 --> 08:00.071
Yes, sir?

08:01.937 --> 08:02.939
You okay?

08:03.973 --> 08:05.843
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

08:06.810 --> 08:07.812
you know...

08:08.144 --> 08:09.212
You know what, Michael?

08:11.814 --> 08:13.817
I think I'm sick.

08:15.985 --> 08:17.051
You know what my father
used to say

08:17.053 --> 08:18.822
when I was about your age,
Michael?

08:19.221 --> 08:20.288
Um...

08:20.290 --> 08:22.293
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

08:23.894 --> 08:24.894
Um...

08:25.961 --> 08:27.798
You know,
we have the same shoes.

08:31.233 --> 08:32.235
Hey, Michael.

08:35.004 --> 08:36.340
How high are you, anyway?

08:37.240 --> 08:39.376
- Really, Mr. Shaw...
- You're just a little high?

08:41.244 --> 08:42.245
A lot, isn't it?

08:43.980 --> 08:45.383
- Um...
- Actually...

08:46.783 --> 08:48.719
I'd say
on the getting high spectrum

08:49.785 --> 08:51.721
you've reached motherfucker
status.

08:53.756 --> 08:54.791
Can you say that?

08:57.124 --> 08:57.157
It's just me and you.
I can say pretty much

08:57.159 --> 08:58.294
say anything I want, right?

09:00.062 --> 09:01.298
You're the best teacher ever.

09:05.268 --> 09:06.771
You're a great kid, Mikey.

09:08.270 --> 09:09.839
I want you at this school.

09:10.072 --> 09:12.175
I don't want to see you
throw away this opportunity.

09:15.846 --> 09:16.846
Listen,

09:17.813 --> 09:19.716
I'm just gonna keep this
between me and you,

09:22.085 --> 09:23.153
consider it a warning.

09:26.523 --> 09:27.622
Here's my number.

09:27.624 --> 09:29.757
I'm not saying
you need it, but if you do,

09:29.759 --> 09:31.761
use it, alright?
You can call me, okay?

09:32.461 --> 09:33.463
Look.

09:34.364 --> 09:35.365
How is Harold holding up?

09:36.032 --> 09:37.033
H?

09:38.301 --> 09:39.770
He's fine, I think.

09:40.136 --> 09:41.502
Alright, feel free
to pass that along

09:41.504 --> 09:42.706
if you think it will help.

09:44.807 --> 09:46.043
Okay. Thanks.

09:46.809 --> 09:47.811
You heading home now?

09:48.177 --> 09:49.179
Yes, sir.

09:50.246 --> 09:51.546
You might want to stop off
and pick up some Visine

09:51.548 --> 09:52.750
along the way.

10:02.325 --> 10:04.328
Yo,
I am pumped for tonight's show.

10:05.061 --> 10:06.363
They are bringing Donna.

10:06.929 --> 10:08.095
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's a date for...

10:08.097 --> 10:09.263
- for Mikey?
- For Mikey.

10:09.265 --> 10:10.800
Yo, he's gonna be down for that.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.533
Yo,
how did it go?

10:12.535 --> 10:14.569
- Aw, man, it sucked.
- What's up, dude?

10:14.571 --> 10:15.538
He didn't
bust your balls?

10:16.438 --> 10:18.205
Hey,
it's Bernie Blackoff junior!

10:19.176 --> 10:21.242
Tell your dad
to start warming up his ass!

10:21.244 --> 10:22.980
Yeah, his ass!

10:23.480 --> 10:24.782
Blackoff!

10:25.081 --> 10:27.384

Hey, hey.

10:36.091 --> 10:37.093
Give me that paper!

10:37.360 --> 10:38.495
Go, fucker!

10:39.495 --> 10:40.930
What the fuck is your problem,
man?

10:42.331 --> 10:43.466
That's right go to your nannies!

10:47.169 --> 10:48.204
What the fuck?

10:49.840 --> 10:50.875
Fucking shit!

10:53.943 --> 10:55.211
What the fuck
is wrong with them, man?

10:55.846 --> 10:56.846
- You good, H?
- Yeah.

10:57.947 --> 10:59.414
If they're coming back
I'll fucking kick their ass!

10:59.416 --> 11:01.114
I'll fucking
break their legs, man.

11:01.116 --> 11:02.352
No.

11:02.852 --> 11:03.853
Now let's just bounce.

12:44.955 --> 12:46.223
Happy birthday, Daddy.

12:50.961 --> 12:52.263
Your dad is so proud of you.

13:05.508 --> 13:06.574
I'm hungry.

13:08.244 --> 13:09.245
How about Chinese?

13:09.980 --> 13:11.981
All we ever eat
is Chinese.

13:14.616 --> 13:16.150
Who wants to smoke
a blunt?

15:50.606 --> 15:51.607
I'm stirring.

15:52.542 --> 15:53.543
What?

15:54.677 --> 15:55.846
What do you mean what?
I'm stirring the sauce.

Taste this.

16:07.157 --> 16:08.425
Hmm?

16:08.691 --> 16:10.160
Nice work, babe.

16:11.293 --> 16:12.295
Are we close?

16:13.263 --> 16:13.797
I'm just gonna
put the pasta in the water.

16:15.697 --> 16:17.300

- Yeah?

16:19.168 --> 16:20.169
You're so beautiful.

16:21.236 --> 16:21.768
You could have yelled
that to me in the kitchen.

16:21.770 --> 16:23.204
I'm grading papers.

16:23.206 --> 16:24.274
Doesn't look like it.

16:25.274 --> 16:26.309

16:33.750 --> 16:34.750
I'm worried about him.

16:35.350 --> 16:37.453
Well, I will kick his dad's ass

16:37.820 --> 16:39.289

16:43.860 --> 16:45.059
Danny!

16:45.061 --> 16:47.264
- Don't call me Danny.
- Then don't say retarded.

16:47.897 --> 16:49.729
My students are not exercising

16:49.731 --> 16:51.802
their cognitive abilities
to their full potential.

16:52.201 --> 16:53.767
Way to use your words.

16:54.836 --> 16:56.173
Oh, go check on Lola.

16:56.438 --> 16:57.440
Dinner is almost ready.

16:58.508 --> 17:00.576
Yes, miss Shaw.

17:02.879 --> 17:04.780
Hey, it's misses.

17:05.214 --> 17:06.214
Misses.

17:07.182 --> 17:07.981
And you keep up the good work,
there may be

17:07.983 --> 17:09.452
a private tutorial
for you later.

17:09.919 --> 17:10.921
What if I'm bad?

17:12.488 --> 17:14.324
You know what happens
when you're bad.

17:32.642 --> 17:33.644
Nice.

17:39.648 --> 17:40.650
Mikey?

17:41.984 --> 17:43.819
- What?
- Can I sleep with you?

17:44.319 --> 17:45.788
- No.
- Why?

17:46.388 --> 17:47.520
Because you're a big girl now

17:47.522 --> 17:48.925
and you need to sleep
in your own bed.

17:49.791 --> 17:50.793
Where's dad?

17:51.394 --> 17:52.461
I am a big girl.

17:53.528 --> 17:54.765
So you'll sleep in your bed?

17:56.266 --> 17:58.201
I had the dream about mom again.

18:06.742 --> 18:08.276
Want me to sing you the song?

18:08.278 --> 18:09.278
No.

18:12.414 --> 18:13.416
You want to sleep in here?

18:16.853 --> 18:17.854
Thanks, bro.

18:47.416 --> 18:48.484
- Don't smoke!
- Fuck!

18:48.785 --> 18:49.786
Ah, fuck!

18:50.920 --> 18:51.989
What the fuck do you want, C?

18:52.454 --> 18:53.586
Don't curse.

18:53.588 --> 18:54.590
You just did.

18:54.790 --> 18:56.292
- Respect your elders.
- Bullshit.

18:59.328 --> 19:00.329
Mom's been...

19:00.663 --> 19:01.661
I know.

19:01.663 --> 19:03.596
She hasn't had anything
but vodka, cigarettes

19:03.598 --> 19:04.867
and baby food
for the past three days.

19:05.867 --> 19:06.936
She likes baby food.

19:11.007 --> 19:12.808
Imagine if they knew
we were right here behind.

19:15.111 --> 19:16.480
She thinks
they are coming for her too.

19:16.746 --> 19:17.748
They might.

19:22.818 --> 19:23.819
What are we gonna do?

19:25.887 --> 19:27.624
No one is gonna separate us, H.

19:27.890 --> 19:28.892
I promise.

19:29.826 --> 19:30.826
Hey.

19:34.029 --> 19:35.365
Think they're gonna
take the house?

19:36.598 --> 19:37.600
Don't know.

19:39.769 --> 19:40.770
I hate him.

19:43.038 --> 19:44.971
If mom doesn't eat anything
by the end of the week

19:44.973 --> 19:46.440
I'm gonna call grandma.

19:46.442 --> 19:47.708
You think
that's gonna do anything?

19:47.710 --> 19:48.711
We gotta do something.

19:50.011 --> 19:51.714
I really fucking
hate him, Christian.

19:52.781 --> 19:53.783
Me too.

19:58.653 --> 19:59.687
Where are you going?

19:59.689 --> 20:00.691
Anywhere but here.

20:00.923 --> 20:02.392
- Wanna come?
- Nah.

20:03.425 --> 20:04.493
I gotta hook up with Leyla.

20:04.727 --> 20:06.760
Get it, bro.
Tight shit.

23:06.576 --> 23:08.111
Jesus Christ.

23:10.112 --> 23:11.178
I'm fine by the way.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.582
Yeah,
just get in the car.

23:29.131 --> 23:30.133
Here, drink this.

23:31.134 --> 23:32.001
- It's cold.
- Just drink it.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.369
And she sleeps.

25:55.810 --> 25:56.910
You okay?

25:56.912 --> 25:58.048
Yeah, you?

25:59.414 --> 26:00.884
I feel
like a beached whale.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.415
Well,
you look like one.

26:03.486 --> 26:06.890
Your cooking prowess
is second only to your wit.

26:11.894 --> 26:13.128
Oh, keep that coming, love.

26:15.765 --> 26:17.033
So is she down for the night?

26:18.299 --> 26:20.066
Yeah, yeah she should be good

26:20.068 --> 26:22.705
until her usual
5 a.m. wake up call.

26:26.174 --> 26:27.176
We did good, right?

26:30.045 --> 26:31.047
We did.

26:32.181 --> 26:33.182
Yeah?

26:36.919 --> 26:38.088
Wanna go on a little walk?

26:39.255 --> 26:41.124
I can run next door and ask
the redhead to come over.

26:41.323 --> 26:42.956
- No?
- I'm tired, honey.

26:42.958 --> 26:43.993
Oh, come on.

26:44.259 --> 26:46.128
No?

26:46.327 --> 26:47.329
- You go.
- Nah.

26:49.298 --> 26:51.034
Oh, come on.
You can go take a ride.

26:52.401 --> 26:53.403
Hmm?

26:53.969 --> 26:54.971
A quick loop and back.

26:55.371 --> 26:56.372
Sure.

27:05.114 --> 27:06.115
- Hey.
- What?

27:06.347 --> 27:07.517
Why don't you run a nice bath?

27:08.349 --> 27:09.818
Okay, hurry back.

27:10.885 --> 27:11.887
I will.

27:12.288 --> 27:13.957
Hey, take your phone.

27:16.392 --> 27:17.393
Hey!

27:17.992 --> 27:18.994
This.

27:19.828 --> 27:20.829
Right here.

27:21.063 --> 27:22.528
Like right there.

27:22.530 --> 27:23.532
Right there.

27:26.568 --> 27:27.770
Bye.

27:33.209 --> 27:34.540
- So you like him?
- Yeah, he's cute, right?

27:34.542 --> 27:36.176
I knew it!

27:36.178 --> 27:38.612
I mean he's weird,
but I like it.

27:38.614 --> 27:40.350
- No, yeah, I like him.
- He's a sweetie.

27:41.049 --> 27:42.317
You know about his mom, right?

27:43.251 --> 27:44.253
Yeah.

27:44.486 --> 27:45.419
It sucks.

27:45.421 --> 27:47.453
Oh,
Felix is gonna have a blast

27:47.455 --> 27:49.021
picking that out of my pussy.

27:49.023 --> 27:51.124
What?

27:54.864 --> 27:55.899
Did I tell you...

27:56.965 --> 27:59.333
that Felix's dad might be
going back to Argentina?

27:59.335 --> 28:01.401
No, are you gonna go with him?

28:01.403 --> 28:03.903
She can't go with him
to Argentina.

28:03.905 --> 28:05.274
What? No.

28:05.875 --> 28:06.875
She's right.

28:07.276 --> 28:08.278
I could go with him.

28:10.112 --> 28:12.211
Yes! Fuck school!

28:12.213 --> 28:14.850
No, but actually, fuck school.

28:15.049 --> 28:17.820
My dad decided not to pay
my school tuition anymore

28:18.386 --> 28:20.123
and they're not gonna give me
a scholarship.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.358
Wait, Mikey's on a scholarship,
right?

28:23.558 --> 28:24.560
Yeah.

28:26.628 --> 28:27.963
I'm on a scholarship.

28:31.432 --> 28:32.434
I'm fucked.

28:34.903 --> 28:36.038
Speaking of fucked,

28:37.038 --> 28:39.206
Let's go find them.

28:39.208 --> 28:40.210
Yeah, baby!

28:43.244 --> 28:45.077
Just come on, guys.
We're almost there.

28:45.079 --> 28:46.381
Felix,
where are we going?

28:46.949 --> 28:48.418
Oh,
we're going to the spot.

28:49.518 --> 28:51.485
- What spot?
- Oh, you'll see.

28:51.487 --> 28:53.323
Aren't these flashlights
big as fuck?

28:53.689 --> 28:54.891
Word.

29:10.638 --> 29:11.640
What, really?

29:12.641 --> 29:13.643
Just fucking...

29:16.010 --> 29:17.611
Just... drive.

29:17.613 --> 29:19.446
I can't keep covering for you.

29:19.448 --> 29:20.450
Yes, you can.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.219
Nobody got shot.

29:26.221 --> 29:27.289
That's not the point.

29:28.656 --> 29:29.658
Okay, okay.

29:30.192 --> 29:31.193
I'm sorry.

29:32.627 --> 29:33.629
I'll make it up to you.

29:38.334 --> 29:39.335
No, you won't.

29:40.035 --> 29:41.037
Yeah.

29:41.603 --> 29:43.339
You're right. I probably won't.

30:17.405 --> 30:19.709
Hmm. Nice song, babe.

30:21.442 --> 30:23.176
Thank you, baby.

30:23.178 --> 30:24.611
Shut up,
don't even start!

30:24.613 --> 30:26.382
The man in the woods.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.518
Oh shit!

30:29.218 --> 30:30.353
Do you remember that?

30:31.286 --> 30:33.487
Shut up,
Leyla's so scared right now!

30:33.489 --> 30:34.490
No, I'm not!

30:34.690 --> 30:37.093
Wait,
what's the man in the park?

30:38.124 --> 30:38.126
Or the whatever.

30:38.493 --> 30:39.995
You've never heard
about the howl?

30:40.561 --> 30:41.561
No.

30:41.563 --> 30:43.563
Howl was
the coyote in the park

30:43.565 --> 30:45.067
when we were kids.

30:45.299 --> 30:46.466
Yeah, you remember him.

30:46.468 --> 30:47.334
No, what?

30:47.336 --> 30:49.038
No, no,
listen, listen.

30:49.771 --> 30:51.438
Howl was this coyote

30:51.440 --> 30:52.442
who got loose

30:52.673 --> 30:54.009
somehow, in the park.

30:54.476 --> 30:55.979
The man in the woods is

30:56.310 --> 30:58.180
this dude that, like,

30:58.713 --> 31:00.212
lives in the park.

31:00.214 --> 31:01.583
And he killed the coyote.

31:02.151 --> 31:04.351
And then he became
like a wolf man

31:04.353 --> 31:05.488
except, with the coyote.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.589
Howl the coyote man.

31:08.123 --> 31:10.159
Didn't that dude eat rats?

31:11.593 --> 31:13.663
Well, he's a coyote man so yeah.

31:14.229 --> 31:16.095
- Why are you so mean?
- Shut up before I freak out!

31:17.298 --> 31:18.300
Truth or dare?

31:18.666 --> 31:21.634
- Yes!
- Like you even have to ask?

31:23.105 --> 31:24.470
No.

31:24.472 --> 31:27.641
- No, no. We should...
- Play truth or dare.

31:27.643 --> 31:29.379
- Yes, we should.
- I'm in.

31:31.814 --> 31:33.016
Mikey.

31:40.756 --> 31:42.258
Fine, fine! Dare.

31:42.590 --> 31:44.524
No, I mean truth.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.396
- No, too late.
- Take a bet.

31:48.797 --> 31:49.798
Mikey.

31:51.834 --> 31:53.135
I dare you to kiss Donna.

31:53.535 --> 31:55.334
On the mouth.

31:55.336 --> 31:56.369
On the mouth.

31:56.371 --> 31:57.504
- Make it legitimate.
- Boom.

31:57.506 --> 31:58.508
Okay.

31:59.340 --> 32:00.474
Come here big boy.

32:00.476 --> 32:01.477
Oh!

32:01.876 --> 32:04.478
- Kiss me.
- Mikey, Mikey!

32:06.781 --> 32:07.783
Alright, alright. Moving on.

32:10.251 --> 32:11.586
Okay, okay, okay.

32:11.787 --> 32:12.788
My turn.

32:14.890 --> 32:16.092
Harold.

32:20.796 --> 32:21.798
Truth.

32:25.601 --> 32:26.602
Is it true...

32:27.169 --> 32:28.334
about your dad?

32:28.336 --> 32:29.401
And how much money

32:29.403 --> 32:30.737
- Yo, Mikey.
- Did he actually steal?

32:30.739 --> 32:33.507
Jesus, Mikey.
You're a dick.

32:33.509 --> 32:34.509
It's fine.

32:35.176 --> 32:36.278
Everybody wants to know.

32:38.380 --> 32:39.382
I'll tell you.

32:43.285 --> 32:44.420
Come on, H.

32:44.619 --> 32:46.488
Mikey,
fucking back off, dude.

32:47.689 --> 32:48.691
It's legit.

32:49.724 --> 32:51.326
It's not like people
don't know already, right?

33:00.169 --> 33:01.170
It's true.

33:02.304 --> 33:03.306
Okay?

33:06.275 --> 33:07.343
I don't know how much.

33:08.777 --> 33:09.778
A lot.

33:11.813 --> 33:14.283
And a lot of the people
that my dad stole money from,

33:15.784 --> 33:16.786
those were his friends.

33:22.290 --> 33:23.291
He used everybody.

33:27.296 --> 33:28.364
I mean,
I didn't know it, but,

33:29.597 --> 33:31.600
even me and my brother
were pawns in his game.

33:35.804 --> 33:36.873
It was all for him.

33:38.941 --> 33:40.143
The long con.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.481
I hate him.

33:51.220 --> 33:52.387
I wish he was dead.

34:03.464 --> 34:05.433
It kind of feels good
to get that off my chest.

34:07.903 --> 34:10.572
But I mean it is true, so...

34:18.246 --> 34:20.282
Dude, if something like that
happened to me

34:20.648 --> 34:21.914
someone ruined my life like that

34:21.916 --> 34:24.186
- I'd fucking kill the guy.
- Jesus, Felix.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.222
I'm just saying I know where
my man H is coming from.

34:32.393 --> 34:33.360
I could.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.393
Like that
fucking bitch Willa.

35:35.856 --> 35:37.460
So he takes her
down the hall.

35:38.994 --> 35:40.630
He takes her to the cafeteria.

35:43.065 --> 35:45.434
First thing he shows her
is the meat slicer.

35:47.702 --> 35:48.802
And he says...

35:48.804 --> 35:49.805
Wait.

35:50.438 --> 35:51.271
Wait, wait.

35:51.273 --> 35:52.972
Bro, come on.
They're just getting

35:52.974 --> 35:54.343
to the cafeteria.

35:55.577 --> 35:56.579
Wait I have to...

35:57.112 --> 35:58.314
I...

35:59.014 --> 36:00.746
No, I...

36:00.748 --> 36:01.847
have to take a wiz.

36:01.849 --> 36:03.383
Yo, go, bro.

36:03.385 --> 36:04.318
We're not going anywhere.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.318
I gotta pee.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.854
Shut up, Sessa!
I ain't scared.

36:07.856 --> 36:09.755
What?

36:09.757 --> 36:11.359
Why?

36:11.860 --> 36:13.762
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Yo, is he that fucked up?

36:14.862 --> 36:16.563
Now I've seen it all.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.300
What now?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.335
Mikey
is fucked.

36:21.536 --> 36:22.838
How fucked up
is he?

36:25.373 --> 36:27.440
I've never seen him
that fucked up.

36:27.442 --> 36:28.742
Ever.

36:28.744 --> 36:29.879
Donna's done something.

36:31.646 --> 36:33.582
Done something right.

37:49.458 --> 37:51.726

40:42.664 --> 40:43.729
Hey, Mikey.

40:43.731 --> 40:44.764
It's Mr. Shaw.

40:44.766 --> 40:45.768
I just got your text.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.769
Call me back, alright?

41:07.922 --> 41:10.059
Hey, have you guys
seen any kids?

41:10.958 --> 41:12.126
What are you
looking for, buddy?

41:49.230 --> 41:50.298
<i>Yo, this is
Mikey.</i>

42:04.411 --> 42:06.112
Iowa! Whatecowa!

42:06.114 --> 42:07.382
What?

42:09.117 --> 42:10.119
Drink!

42:10.851 --> 42:11.853
Drink!

42:13.253 --> 42:14.920
Okay. Okay, okay.

42:14.922 --> 42:16.121
Hmm...

42:16.123 --> 42:17.826
Let's do some candies!

42:19.860 --> 42:20.992
Let's do Skittles!

42:20.994 --> 42:22.028
Where's Mikey?

42:22.030 --> 42:23.032
Drink!

42:23.898 --> 42:25.067
Just take your shit!

42:26.233 --> 42:27.869
Chug, chug!

42:28.268 --> 42:29.270
Come on, baby!

42:33.273 --> 42:34.742
Yo, he's been gone for a minute.

42:35.143 --> 42:36.144
- Where is he?
- Wait.

42:37.846 --> 42:38.646
Hold up.

42:40.148 --> 42:41.748
Leyla,
what did you tell your parents?

42:41.750 --> 42:43.251
About what?

42:43.918 --> 42:45.688
About where
you were going tonight?

42:45.987 --> 42:47.289
I told my mom
I'm staying indoors.

42:47.521 --> 42:48.887
Fuck!

42:48.889 --> 42:50.255
What? Don't worry.

42:50.257 --> 42:51.259
Why not?

42:52.226 --> 42:54.159
Guys, my parents never answer
their phones

42:54.161 --> 42:55.163
and my nanny will cover.

42:55.429 --> 42:56.431
Nannies are the best.

43:02.336 --> 43:04.170
I'm gonna go find
where Mikey is.

43:04.172 --> 43:05.773
Yeah, where is he?

43:06.306 --> 43:08.209
Aw!

43:08.809 --> 43:10.311
What?

43:11.179 --> 43:12.778
No,
we're not staying here alone.

43:12.780 --> 43:14.483
This is your friend!

43:15.048 --> 43:16.782
Yo, Mikey!

43:16.784 --> 43:18.184
Felix We're not supposed
to be here, remember?

43:18.186 --> 43:19.254
Just chill.

43:19.454 --> 43:20.456
We'll be right back.

43:21.422 --> 43:23.224
Please, don't leave me
I'm so high.

43:25.293 --> 43:27.061
On your feet.
You got a light?

43:27.461 --> 43:28.494
Oh yeah.

43:28.496 --> 43:29.498
Boom. Alright.

43:30.130 --> 43:31.299
Let's go find this kid.

43:32.567 --> 43:33.802
Yo, Mikey!

43:37.005 --> 43:38.907
Donna? Donna?

43:39.807 --> 43:41.043
Wait, he went up
through here, right?

43:41.242 --> 43:42.444
I think so, yeah.

43:44.211 --> 43:45.246
It's this way, right?

43:52.085 --> 43:53.387
<i>Yo, this is
Mikey.</i>

43:55.590 --> 43:56.792
Mikey!

44:00.394 --> 44:01.429
Come on, Mikey.

44:02.396 --> 44:04.065
I can only do so much.

44:06.501 --> 44:07.536
Mikey!

44:30.557 --> 44:32.561
Fuck. Come on.

44:34.461 --> 44:37.065
Come on, junk.
Two, four six, eight.

44:39.867 --> 44:41.536
- No, you're fucking up!
- You're going too fast!

44:46.608 --> 44:47.641
That's not funny!

44:47.643 --> 44:50.342
Shut up! You scared
the actual crap out of us!

44:50.344 --> 44:51.346
Yo, babe. I'm sorry.

44:53.547 --> 44:54.949
Yo, Mikey!

44:55.550 --> 44:56.818
That's not funny!

44:57.050 --> 44:58.416
- Babe, come here.
- Where is he!

44:58.418 --> 44:59.821
- I'm hungry!
- Come here, come here.

45:00.554 --> 45:01.556
I'm sorry.

45:03.490 --> 45:04.492
I'm sorry.

45:07.427 --> 45:09.431
Yo, Mikey, let's go!

45:11.532 --> 45:13.032
Wanna go to the all-night diner?

45:13.034 --> 45:15.170
- Yeah.
- Because your eye's bleeding.

45:16.503 --> 45:17.505
H!

45:18.438 --> 45:19.440
Yo, H!

45:19.907 --> 45:20.909
Dude!

45:22.043 --> 45:23.445
You and Leyla
go that way. We'll go this way.

45:24.077 --> 45:25.112
We'll meet at the bottom
of the hill.

45:25.646 --> 45:26.849
Tight.

45:30.585 --> 45:31.684
Donna.

45:31.686 --> 45:32.952
Felix.

45:36.356 --> 45:38.025
Jesus, guys.

45:38.326 --> 45:39.391
Fuck me.

45:39.393 --> 45:40.928
Mikey!

47:12.719 --> 47:14.455
<i>Hey, it's Daniel.
Leave a message, thanks.</i>

47:37.077 --> 47:38.679
Stop.

47:41.315 --> 47:43.485
Hang on, it's cold.

47:45.186 --> 47:46.188
Are you okay?

47:46.721 --> 47:47.722
Yeah.

47:48.789 --> 47:49.992
Why?

47:50.557 --> 47:52.494
Nothing. I just...

47:53.193 --> 47:54.195
Hey.

47:55.195 --> 47:56.197
I'm okay.

47:56.530 --> 47:57.532
Are you sure?

48:00.201 --> 48:01.333
Because we've never talked
about it and I want you to know

48:01.335 --> 48:03.204
- that I'm here for you.
- Hey.

48:05.606 --> 48:06.608
I'm fine.

48:08.608 --> 48:09.677
As long as we're good,

48:10.811 --> 48:12.413
then I'm good.

48:13.614 --> 48:14.615
Great.

48:15.382 --> 48:16.384
I love you, baby.

48:17.117 --> 48:18.152
I love you too.

48:38.773 --> 48:39.775
What?

48:42.110 --> 48:43.111
Why are you calling me?

48:46.213 --> 48:47.215
Hey.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.153
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

48:51.751 --> 48:52.753
You okay?

48:53.487 --> 48:54.522
No, I mean...

48:55.489 --> 48:56.791
Yes, I don't know.

48:58.793 --> 49:00.693
I'm sorry to bother you at work,
but I'm freaking out.

49:00.695 --> 49:01.793
<i>It's okay.</i>

49:01.795 --> 49:03.464
What's happened
and what's going on?

49:04.398 --> 49:06.268
Okay, I don't know
where Daniel is.

49:07.201 --> 49:08.202
Did you call him?

49:09.237 --> 49:10.302
<i>Yeah,
of course I called him.</i>

49:10.304 --> 49:12.204
I called him like 50 times.
He's not answering.

49:12.206 --> 49:13.375
I don't know what to do now.

49:14.175 --> 49:15.410
This is really unlike him.

49:16.811 --> 49:17.809
How long?

49:17.811 --> 49:19.480
I don't know.
A couple of hours now I guess.

49:19.847 --> 49:21.280
<i>You know
I can't do anything...</i>

49:21.282 --> 49:24.486
Come on,
he wouldn't do this, okay?

49:25.418 --> 49:26.721
<i>He wouldn't leave us
alone like this.</i>

49:28.188 --> 49:29.190
Us?

49:32.492 --> 49:34.728
Um, when was the last time
that we talked?

49:36.230 --> 49:37.231
I don't know. Like a year.

49:39.467 --> 49:40.635
I had a baby.

49:42.302 --> 49:44.205
I had a girl. Lola.

49:50.777 --> 49:51.779
Oh.

49:55.815 --> 49:58.219
It's been close
to four hours now so...

50:00.188 --> 50:01.189
What happened?

50:02.523 --> 50:04.559
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- If that thing moves...

50:05.559 --> 50:06.561
Were you fighting?

50:07.260 --> 50:08.262
<i>No!</i>

50:08.528 --> 50:09.731
No, fuck me.

50:11.766 --> 50:12.767
<i>Why did he go out?</i>

50:13.300 --> 50:14.333
Look, I don't know.

50:14.335 --> 50:15.467
He had a big dinner

50:15.469 --> 50:16.570
and he wanted some exercise.

50:18.572 --> 50:19.875
I'm really, um...

50:20.507 --> 50:21.742
Worried, so...

50:23.244 --> 50:24.379
I want you to come.

50:30.617 --> 50:31.619
I'm on my way.

50:46.900 --> 50:48.603
- You're okay with this?
- Here?

50:49.637 --> 50:51.640
Yeah. Here.

50:51.871 --> 50:53.641
Oh, God! I want you so bad!

50:58.411 --> 50:59.413
Take me home.

51:03.583 --> 51:04.618
Come on, let's go.

51:07.788 --> 51:08.789
You got the flashlight?

51:14.427 --> 51:15.429
Damn.

51:29.777 --> 51:30.742
You okay, Leyla?

51:30.744 --> 51:32.945
- Holy shit!
- Mikey!

51:32.947 --> 51:34.045
No, no, no. Don't touch him!

51:58.505 --> 51:59.773
Don't worry
I'm right behind you!

52:05.846 --> 52:06.847
Keep going!

52:52.726 --> 52:53.728
Boy or a girl?

52:54.762 --> 52:55.894
Girl.

52:55.896 --> 52:56.965
That was fast.

52:58.699 --> 52:59.800
She knew what she wanted.

53:03.371 --> 53:05.307
Rico Was the best thing
to ever happen to me.

53:07.507 --> 53:08.542
I bought him a fire truck.

53:10.911 --> 53:12.380
He likes planes now.

53:24.525 --> 53:26.528
I'm just gonna pick her up
and take her for a ride.

53:28.094 --> 53:29.096
She'll calm down.

53:55.456 --> 53:56.958
Come on,
Leyla, where are you, Leyla!

53:59.059 --> 54:00.061
Leyla!

54:02.797 --> 54:03.932
Where are you,
Leyla?

54:20.547 --> 54:21.715
Leyla!

54:29.889 --> 54:30.891
Leyla!

54:37.164 --> 54:38.166
Leyla?

54:42.869 --> 54:43.871
Leyla!

54:50.510 --> 54:51.512
Shit.

54:52.480 --> 54:53.481
Shit.

54:55.148 --> 54:56.150
Fuck.

55:01.155 --> 55:02.157
Leyla!

55:04.858 --> 55:05.860
Leyla!

55:12.599 --> 55:15.166
Roll
a blunt, Felix!

55:17.137 --> 55:18.072
Yo, Felix,
where are the blunts?

55:19.507 --> 55:21.139
Dude!
We've been waiting for you!

55:21.141 --> 55:22.773
Like 20 minutes!

55:22.775 --> 55:23.909
Where are the blunts?

55:23.911 --> 55:25.579
Where the fuck is Mikey?

55:26.045 --> 55:27.114
Where's Leyla?

55:27.947 --> 55:29.183
- Oh, yes!
- I want it.

55:31.150 --> 55:32.152
Hey, what's wrong?

55:33.186 --> 55:34.188
Are you okay?

55:35.856 --> 55:36.858
Mikey's dead.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.193
I thought Leyla was with you.

55:40.894 --> 55:42.197
What are you
talking about, bro?

55:42.663 --> 55:43.929
This is not funny.

55:43.931 --> 55:45.229
You know
I've got a heart arrhythmia.

55:45.231 --> 55:46.664
Fuck!
Mikey is over there!

55:46.666 --> 55:47.802
His fucking head is blown out!

55:50.103 --> 55:52.206
What?

55:53.907 --> 55:55.676
Mikey is dead.

55:58.679 --> 56:00.882
Mikey is fucking dead, man!

56:02.615 --> 56:04.215
Where's Leyla?

56:04.217 --> 56:05.953
I don't know.

56:06.554 --> 56:07.355
Oh my God!

56:09.556 --> 56:11.155
Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

56:11.157 --> 56:12.724
We need to
get the fuck out of here!

56:14.295 --> 56:16.028
Donna calm down!

56:16.030 --> 56:18.063
What do you mean
calm down?

56:18.065 --> 56:20.802
Why the fuck
would anybody kill Mikey? Dude!

56:21.001 --> 56:22.733
No, no, no. Let's leave!

56:22.735 --> 56:23.737
Fuck!

56:24.304 --> 56:25.704
Oh my God!

56:25.706 --> 56:27.642
Look, H, I'm sorry

56:27.942 --> 56:29.941
but I don't think you saw
what you thought you saw.

56:29.943 --> 56:31.709
I fucking saw Mikey,
man! He is dead!

56:31.711 --> 56:33.248
This is a sick joke, H!

56:33.713 --> 56:34.746
Stop!

56:34.748 --> 56:35.914
It's hell!

56:35.916 --> 56:37.986
Donna, stop it!

56:38.952 --> 56:40.751
Sessa get your shit
together. Now!

56:40.753 --> 56:41.887
Stop. It's a joke.

56:41.889 --> 56:43.722
They're fucking with you
because you're the new chick.

56:43.724 --> 56:46.027
I want to go home.

56:46.594 --> 56:49.061
Okay, we can go home
after we find Mikey and Leyla.

56:49.063 --> 56:51.266
I want to go home. Now!

56:51.798 --> 56:52.867
Come on, dude.

56:54.702 --> 56:56.004
It's okay, man.
It's okay, let's go.

56:56.737 --> 56:58.003
You need to chill
the fuck out! Stop!

56:58.005 --> 56:59.271
Leyla? It's cool.

56:59.273 --> 57:01.606
No,
don't you fucking leave me!

57:32.739 --> 57:34.039
They are
messing with you.

57:34.041 --> 57:35.343
Dude.

57:35.909 --> 57:37.244
This is so much.

57:37.677 --> 57:38.478
I need another one.

57:39.847 --> 57:41.049
Dude,
where the fuck is he?

57:41.248 --> 57:42.750
No, no, no.
He was right here.

57:43.150 --> 57:45.349
He was right here.
He was right fucking here!

57:45.351 --> 57:46.918
There's nobody here now.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.153
Leyla!

57:48.155 --> 57:49.787
Shut the fuck up, H!
You're gonna get us all killed!

57:49.789 --> 57:50.791
Donna, please.

57:51.425 --> 57:52.657
Could you stop?

57:52.659 --> 57:53.724
It is not like some...

57:53.726 --> 57:54.728
Wait! Did you hear that?

57:54.994 --> 57:56.061
Hear what?

57:56.063 --> 57:57.898
No, I thought I heard something.

58:01.001 --> 58:02.236
Oh,
this is so great.

58:03.036 --> 58:04.170
Come on, man!

58:04.172 --> 58:05.871
I want
to go home. I wanna go home now.

58:05.873 --> 58:07.072
Please calm down, D.

58:07.074 --> 58:08.209
They are just fucking with you.

58:10.443 --> 58:11.646
What the fuck is that?

58:14.815 --> 58:15.817
Oh my God!

58:16.382 --> 58:17.384
Oh my God! Leyla!

58:25.759 --> 58:26.994
Oh my God! Fuck!

58:28.795 --> 58:29.860
Mikey!

58:29.862 --> 58:31.832
Mikey! Oh my God!

58:33.233 --> 58:34.235
Oh shit!

58:37.403 --> 58:38.405
He's dead!

58:44.110 --> 58:45.112
Sessa!

58:49.282 --> 58:50.284
Sessa!

58:51.851 --> 58:53.120
Get up.
We have to leave.

58:53.721 --> 58:54.755
I'm not gonna leave you here.

59:05.164 --> 59:06.300
Where did the rain come from?

59:06.900 --> 59:08.302
It's springtime in New York.

59:10.871 --> 59:11.873
Sure you want to do this?

59:12.873 --> 59:14.072
I can't say no to her.

59:14.074 --> 59:15.076
The book says no.

59:16.309 --> 59:18.309
Not that it matters, but you can
always use it as an excuse.

59:18.311 --> 59:19.880
No. I'm just gonna

59:20.146 --> 59:21.849
drive around
until she calms down.

59:22.882 --> 59:23.884
Okay then.

59:29.422 --> 59:30.424
Fix your fucking pen.

59:42.869 --> 59:43.871
Hey.

59:44.371 --> 59:45.940
- Hey.
- Hi.

59:47.173 --> 59:48.175
Thank you for doing this.

59:49.275 --> 59:50.277
You okay?

59:51.211 --> 59:52.313
I'm fine.
I'm just really glad you came.

59:53.179 --> 59:54.748
Of course.
Don't even worry about it.

59:55.081 --> 59:56.280
My neighbor
is watching the baby.

59:56.282 --> 59:57.784
It is just so unlike him.

59:58.318 --> 59:59.320
I'm sure it's nothing.

01:00:08.327 --> 01:00:09.329
Say hi to Sam.

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:15.502
Sam, hi.

01:00:15.936 --> 01:00:17.101
How are you?

01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:18.105
Not too good.

01:00:18.472 --> 01:00:19.474
Don't worry. We'll find him.

01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:21.275
Thanks, Sam.

01:00:50.503 --> 01:00:52.204
It's okay. It's okay.

01:00:52.206 --> 01:00:54.438
- It's me. It's me, baby.
- Oh my God, Felix.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.442
Oh, thank God.

01:00:56.009 --> 01:00:57.010
It's okay.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.112
I gotta hold you.

01:01:00.179 --> 01:01:01.246
We gotta go.

01:01:01.248 --> 01:01:02.516
We gotta go find H.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.519
- Fuck, no. We gotta go now!
- Look at me. I love you.

01:01:06.052 --> 01:01:08.052
I love you. I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

01:01:08.054 --> 01:01:09.987
I promise nothing will happen
to the rest of the crew, okay?

01:01:09.989 --> 01:01:11.055
Please,
I just want to go home.

01:01:11.057 --> 01:01:12.123
I'm so scared, please.

01:01:12.125 --> 01:01:13.557
It's my best friend.

01:01:13.559 --> 01:01:14.992
It's my best friend, baby.

01:01:14.994 --> 01:01:16.394
We came together,
we leave together, okay?

01:01:16.396 --> 01:01:17.999
Oh, no, please!

01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:19.400
Baby.

01:01:31.244 --> 01:01:32.110
Oh God.

01:01:32.112 --> 01:01:33.880
- It's okay. Breathe.
- Oh God.

01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:35.082
It's okay.

01:01:50.297 --> 01:01:51.465
- Okay.
- Okay, let's figure it out.

01:01:51.931 --> 01:01:54.067
Let's figure it out.

01:02:10.918 --> 01:02:12.053
How long
since you last called?

01:02:13.353 --> 01:02:15.586
Um, it's 30 minutes.

01:02:15.588 --> 01:02:16.590
Try again.

01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:18.592
Okay.

01:02:24.965 --> 01:02:26.067
No,
straight to voicemail.

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.302
Could there be someone else?

01:02:30.436 --> 01:02:31.438
Detective.

01:02:31.637 --> 01:02:32.639
Johnson?

01:02:33.273 --> 01:02:34.475
- Yes, sir.
- How is the night?

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:36.543
- Quiet, sir.
- Good.

01:02:37.476 --> 01:02:38.511
If you see anything, radio me.

01:02:39.079 --> 01:02:40.081
What am I looking for?

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.081
Don't know yet.

01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:45.619
Hey,
ask her about a bike.

01:02:47.186 --> 01:02:48.188
If she'd seen a bike.

01:02:49.356 --> 01:02:50.487
What about it?

01:02:50.489 --> 01:02:52.057
Well,
like if she'd seen it.

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:54.161
Look, trust me.
If she saw something she's say.

01:02:54.527 --> 01:02:56.096
No need to broadcast this.

01:03:33.699 --> 01:03:35.001
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:04:07.666 --> 01:04:10.170
Come on!
Babe, run!

01:04:17.411 --> 01:04:18.443
Shut up!

01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:19.610
Sessa go!

01:04:19.612 --> 01:04:21.214
Get out! Find help!

01:04:21.581 --> 01:04:22.583
Shut up!

01:04:59.518 --> 01:05:00.520
There! There!

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:07.061
Okay, stay here.
We're gonna go take a look.

01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:16.636
The bike's locked up.

01:05:19.639 --> 01:05:20.641
No flat tire.

01:05:23.376 --> 01:05:24.378
He's cheating on her.

01:05:25.311 --> 01:05:26.376
I'll kill him.

01:05:26.378 --> 01:05:27.577
Only the hottest woman
in the world

01:05:27.579 --> 01:05:29.282
and then she meets someone
who gets tired of fucking her.

01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:30.584
No, not her.

01:05:31.485 --> 01:05:32.486
Yeah, okay.

01:05:40.193 --> 01:05:42.163
Felix.

01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:54.674
Did you hear that?

01:06:00.813 --> 01:06:01.815
Don't open the door for anyone.

01:06:02.315 --> 01:06:03.548
Can I come with you?

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:04.883
- No.
- This is the safest place

01:06:04.885 --> 01:06:06.587
- for you to be.
- How long will you be?

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:08.556
One of us will be back in ten.

01:06:09.523 --> 01:06:10.554
Keep your phone on.

01:06:10.556 --> 01:06:11.791
Sit tight. We'll find him.

01:06:16.329 --> 01:06:17.331
Max.

01:06:18.831 --> 01:06:19.833
Thank you.

01:06:21.668 --> 01:06:22.670
Turn the car on.

01:06:31.577 --> 01:06:33.280
Please listen, Sessa.

01:06:33.579 --> 01:06:35.345
I'm going to remove my hand now,
okay?

01:06:35.347 --> 01:06:36.349
You have to be quiet.

01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:43.858
Felix was attacked.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.292
Is... is...

01:06:45.891 --> 01:06:46.958
is he dead?

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.358
Sessa, is he dead?

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.596
He got smashed
in the face.

01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:52.165
I don't know.

01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:54.298
He told me to run, so I did.

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.469
Oh shit.
We've got to get out of here.

01:06:56.769 --> 01:06:58.369
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

01:06:58.371 --> 01:06:59.503
I'm so glad!

01:06:59.505 --> 01:07:01.572
- We have to leave now.
- Stop!

01:07:01.574 --> 01:07:02.609
We gotta get Harold.

01:07:03.476 --> 01:07:05.409
No! No, no, no!

01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:06.480
We have to leave, Sessa.

01:07:07.246 --> 01:07:08.780
- No!
- No, it's what Felix wanted.

01:07:08.782 --> 01:07:09.717
I gotta do it for him.

01:07:10.884 --> 01:07:12.883
I'm not asking for you
to come with me.

01:07:12.885 --> 01:07:14.385
Please, please, just stay.

01:07:14.387 --> 01:07:15.623
Don't leave me alone.

01:07:19.626 --> 01:07:20.928
- I don't...
- Fuck, okay!

01:07:22.896 --> 01:07:23.898
- Just let me call 911.
- Okay.

01:07:31.905 --> 01:07:33.637
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

01:07:33.639 --> 01:07:34.838
Hello, hi.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840
Please, we need help.

01:07:35.842 --> 01:07:37.608
We're in Central Park.
There's somebody in here

01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:38.775
trying to kill us. We...

01:07:38.777 --> 01:07:40.213
- Fuck!
- Oh my God!

01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:46.253
<i>Hello?</i>

01:07:47.753 --> 01:07:48.755
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:07:50.422 --> 01:07:51.424
<i>Hello?</i>

01:07:52.759 --> 01:07:53.760
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

01:07:56.295 --> 01:07:57.463
<i>Are you in danger?</i>

01:08:03.769 --> 01:08:05.306
No. No.

01:08:05.938 --> 01:08:07.240
No.

01:08:23.456 --> 01:08:24.457
Hey.

01:08:30.296 --> 01:08:31.363
She's gone.

01:08:31.898 --> 01:08:33.063
I know.

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:34.600
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:08:36.868 --> 01:08:38.470
Oh God, it's just us now.

01:08:39.005 --> 01:08:40.006
Where's Felix?

01:08:53.853 --> 01:08:54.919
We gotta go.

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:56.653
Yes, let's go!

01:08:56.654 --> 01:08:58.359
Please, let's go! Please!

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:02.795
Come on!
Come on, please!

01:09:03.863 --> 01:09:05.432
Just leave her
and come on!

01:09:08.966 --> 01:09:09.970
What is that?

01:09:12.837 --> 01:09:14.371
Oh my God.

01:09:14.372 --> 01:09:15.643
What is that?

01:09:17.975 --> 01:09:18.979
What is that?

01:09:23.515 --> 01:09:24.518
What is it?

01:09:42.935 --> 01:09:44.402
You piece
of shit!

01:09:44.404 --> 01:09:45.738
Motherfucker!

01:09:47.907 --> 01:09:48.908
Come on!

01:10:04.423 --> 01:10:05.555
Fuck.

01:10:05.557 --> 01:10:06.592
He's not up here.

01:10:09.061 --> 01:10:10.064
Check by the stream.

01:10:20.506 --> 01:10:22.173
Sessa!
Get the fuck out of here!

01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:23.875
I'm not leaving
without you.

01:10:23.877 --> 01:10:24.942
He wants me, okay?

01:10:24.944 --> 01:10:25.946
He wants my dad!

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.881
We gotta go.

01:10:28.847 --> 01:10:29.949
- We have to get out.
- This is all my fault.

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:31.784
Didn't you see
that card?

01:10:32.952 --> 01:10:34.088
Your dad...

01:10:34.654 --> 01:10:36.454
- money.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:36.456 --> 01:10:37.458
Just breathe.

01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:39.493
- I can't.
- No, don't talk.

01:10:40.092 --> 01:10:41.095
Just catch your breath.

01:10:45.765 --> 01:10:47.568
Let me take care
of this nightmare on my own.

01:10:49.469 --> 01:10:50.802
Just give me
a second.

01:10:50.804 --> 01:10:52.102
I need to finish this.

01:10:52.104 --> 01:10:53.137
No, what are you doing?

01:10:53.139 --> 01:10:54.504
I'm gonna find him.

01:10:54.506 --> 01:10:55.807
If he wants me he can have me.

01:10:55.809 --> 01:10:57.845
- Harold!
- If you're with me you're next!

01:11:00.479 --> 01:11:01.978
You fucking
bastard!

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.117
I'm gonna kill you!

01:11:05.652 --> 01:11:07.617
Come down here
and fight me like a man!

01:11:07.619 --> 01:11:08.820
I'm the one you want!

01:11:08.822 --> 01:11:09.823
Take me!

01:11:15.994 --> 01:11:17.128
I'm going after him.

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:18.998
I need to finish this!

01:11:20.733 --> 01:11:22.002
No!

01:12:09.015 --> 01:12:11.516
Oh my God! Get him away from me!

01:12:11.518 --> 01:12:12.616
He's not dead!

01:12:12.618 --> 01:12:13.619
He's not dead!

01:12:14.921 --> 01:12:16.120
Oh God, kill him!

01:12:16.122 --> 01:12:18.692
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.462
No.

01:12:31.136 --> 01:12:32.905
Don't! Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

01:12:43.882 --> 01:12:45.549
What is happening?

01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:46.853
I'm getting us
the fuck out of here.

01:12:48.587 --> 01:12:50.122
No, no! My leg. My leg!

01:12:52.725 --> 01:12:54.862
Harold!
Harold!

01:12:56.595 --> 01:12:57.830
- What the fuck is that?
- Go!

01:13:50.382 --> 01:13:51.585
Leyla!

01:13:53.319 --> 01:13:54.619
Police!

01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:56.690
Help us!
Help!

01:13:57.789 --> 01:13:58.822
Don't shoot!

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:05.632
I didn't do anything!

01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:07.397
You okay, honey?

01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:09.666
- Did he hurt you?
- No! He's my friend!

01:14:09.668 --> 01:14:10.634
He saved me! Please!

01:14:10.636 --> 01:14:12.805
The guy attacked us
he killed our friends!

01:14:14.873 --> 01:14:15.973
- Who did?
- He did!

01:14:15.975 --> 01:14:16.977
He was hunting us!

01:14:22.681 --> 01:14:23.684
Who are you?

01:14:24.951 --> 01:14:26.653
I'm Harold Lincoln Smith.

01:14:30.222 --> 01:14:31.224
You okay?

01:14:31.957 --> 01:14:33.156
What the fuck happened up there?

01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:35.761
He was gonna kill us.
He threw a rock on my leg!

01:14:36.029 --> 01:14:37.130
The other guy saved us.

01:14:38.064 --> 01:14:39.066
Other guy? What other...

01:14:39.832 --> 01:14:41.034
Oh Jesus Christ!

01:14:58.016 --> 01:15:00.119
<i>911 distress,
Central Park, north west.</i>

01:15:02.255 --> 01:15:04.358
- <i>Twenty-two eighteen.</i>
- <i>Copy.</i>

01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:13.634
Daniel!

01:15:22.007 --> 01:15:23.010
Help!

01:15:27.012 --> 01:15:28.144
Melissa!

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:32.119
No, no, no.
Don't touch him.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.389
I thought
he was gonna...

01:15:36.021 --> 01:15:37.153
Holster your weapon.

01:15:37.155 --> 01:15:38.222
I got a call on the radio

01:15:38.224 --> 01:15:40.257
it looked like he was about to
attack that woman!

01:15:40.259 --> 01:15:41.261
Johnson, God dammit!

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:42.996
Put down the gun.

01:15:47.265 --> 01:15:48.268
Put down the gun.

01:15:50.069 --> 01:15:51.071
Jesus.

01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:58.311
Come here.

01:16:00.011 --> 01:16:01.211
Don't touch him.
An ambulance

01:16:01.213 --> 01:16:02.314
is gonna be here soon, okay?

01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:05.085
I'm sorry, I didn't...

01:16:05.283 --> 01:16:06.318
Listen. Listen to me.

01:16:08.054 --> 01:16:09.056
That skell...

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:10.724
was coming for her...

01:16:11.224 --> 01:16:12.225
and you responded.

01:16:13.259 --> 01:16:15.194
- Yes, sir.
- It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:16:16.328 --> 01:16:17.329
Yes, sir.

01:16:19.398 --> 01:16:20.199
Go and...

01:16:20.966 --> 01:16:22.234
find out where the backup is,
alright?

01:16:33.479 --> 01:16:34.481
Melissa.

01:16:34.913 --> 01:16:35.916
Max.

01:16:37.483 --> 01:16:38.485
Max!

01:16:40.086 --> 01:16:40.887
Max!

01:16:41.354 --> 01:16:43.056
- No, no, no.
- Daniel?

01:16:43.421 --> 01:16:45.222
- Come on!
- No, that's Daniel!

01:16:45.224 --> 01:16:47.324
You can't touch him.

01:16:47.326 --> 01:16:50.296
Get off
of me! Get off of me!

01:16:52.832 --> 01:16:53.834
Don't touch him!

01:16:56.335 --> 01:16:57.337
Got her.

01:16:58.337 --> 01:16:59.505
That's the guy
that saved us.

01:17:00.405 --> 01:17:01.440
It's gonna be okay.

01:17:02.408 --> 01:17:04.444
The ambulance is gonna be here
any second, alright?

01:17:05.344 --> 01:17:07.079
Alright, stay with her.
I'll be right back.

01:17:07.947 --> 01:17:08.981
What happened to him?

01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:20.193
Daniel is their teacher.

01:17:20.525 --> 01:17:22.095
I found him on my way down.
All burned up.

01:17:23.863 --> 01:17:25.265
And that guy
saved the two of them.

01:17:27.099 --> 01:17:28.869
How did the skell wind up
on his back?

01:17:29.202 --> 01:17:30.270
Johnson took a shot.

01:17:30.536 --> 01:17:31.538
Why?

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.809
He was going to attack Melissa.

01:17:40.011 --> 01:17:41.347
Give me one of those.

01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:54.892
Just gonna drive her around
until she calms down.

01:17:54.894 --> 01:17:56.029
Just give me a minute.

01:17:56.595 --> 01:17:57.894
Let me figure this out.

01:17:57.896 --> 01:17:58.899
Look.

01:17:59.231 --> 01:18:01.067
We picked her up,
we saw the bike.

01:18:02.033 --> 01:18:04.000
We got four dead bodies,
three unaccounted for

01:18:04.002 --> 01:18:05.005
and Daniel.

01:18:06.038 --> 01:18:07.039
Look, we're the least
of their concerns.

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.108
- What about the skell?
- What about him?

01:18:10.109 --> 01:18:11.310
God knows
what the hell happened up there.

01:18:12.444 --> 01:18:13.880
Johnson did us a huge favor.

01:18:14.579 --> 01:18:15.582
Gotta give her a medal.

01:18:17.283 --> 01:18:18.285
Yeah.

01:18:21.319 --> 01:18:22.889
Hey, what's wrong?

01:18:25.323 --> 01:18:26.324
Melissa.

01:18:30.195 --> 01:18:31.198
That guy dead?

01:18:33.599 --> 01:18:34.601
I think so.

01:18:36.269 --> 01:18:37.270
Let's make sure.

01:18:41.606 --> 01:18:42.609
I made the call.

01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:45.878
Yeah.

01:18:58.024 --> 01:18:59.226
Where the fuck did he go?

01:19:03.628 --> 01:19:04.631
I thought...

01:20:16.335 --> 01:20:17.337
Smith.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.021
Son don't.
