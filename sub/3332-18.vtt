00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
Latin lover narrator:
<i>All righty-- as you know, jane</i>
<i>was accidentally inseminated</i>

00:00.001 --> 00:08.073
By rafael's sperm, and, man, so
<i>much has happened since then.</i>

00:08.075 --> 00:10.142
<i>First she broke up with her</i>
<i>detective fiancÃ© michael</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:13.078
<i>Because she fell for rafael.</i>
<i>Unfortunately</i>

00:13.080 --> 00:15.147
<i>Things were a little rocky</i>
<i>between them at the moment.</i>

00:15.149 --> 00:18.317
<i>See, rafael proposed</i>
<i>but jane said no, because</i>

00:18.319 --> 00:20.119
<i>It was just too damn soon.</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:22.421
For me, it was all about family

00:22.423 --> 00:25.224
And how badly
I've wanted a family.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.326
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so jane encouraged him</i>
<i>to search for his mother,</i>

00:27.328 --> 00:30.396
<i>Who left when he was four.</i>
<i>Adding to rafael's stress,</i>

00:30.398 --> 00:33.298
<i>The marbella hotel had just</i>
<i>lost its liquor license.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:35.134
<i>And as rafael</i>
<i>focused more on work,</i>

00:35.136 --> 00:36.568
<i>Jane started to get nervous.</i>

00:36.570 --> 00:39.271
I'm scared it's gonna all be
on me. All the child care.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.340
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, petra had been</i>
<i>growing closer</i>

00:41.342 --> 00:43.575
<i>To aaron, the twin brother</i>
<i>of her ex-lover</i>

00:43.577 --> 00:45.444
<i>Roman.</i>
<i>You remember roman, right?</i>

00:45.446 --> 00:47.413
<i>He was impaled.</i>
<i>The only problem:</i>

00:47.415 --> 00:49.681
I don't why, I don't know how,

00:49.683 --> 00:52.151
But I do know that is not aaron.
It's roman.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.319
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Wow, a mother of a twist.</i>
<i>And speaking</i>

00:54.321 --> 00:56.422
<i>Of mothers, xo just learned</i>
<i>what was holding rogelio back</i>

00:56.424 --> 00:59.491
<i>From saying "I love you."</i>
<i>the animosity that</i>
<i>exists between</i>

00:59.493 --> 01:02.227
You and my mother.
And so he invited her to visit.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.297
<i>Which means jane's grandma</i>
<i>is coming to town.</i>

01:08.201 --> 01:09.768
<i>Ah, easter.</i>

01:09.770 --> 01:12.638
<i>The villanuevas'</i>
<i>favorite time of year.</i>

01:12.640 --> 01:15.507
<i>Young jane looked forward</i>
<i>to the chocolate eggs.</i>

01:15.509 --> 01:17.576
Don't fill up. We have
a huge meal to eat.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.378
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Xiomara looked forward</i>

01:19.380 --> 01:21.580
<i>To busting out</i>
<i>her spring wardrobe.</i>
<i>Ah...</i>

01:27.120 --> 01:28.353
<i>And alba?</i>

01:28.355 --> 01:29.455
<i>Well, she looked forward</i>

01:29.457 --> 01:31.090
To celebrating the resurrection

01:31.092 --> 01:33.525
<i>Of her lord and savior,</i>
<i>jesus christ.</i>

01:33.527 --> 01:35.394
Whom god hath raised up,

01:35.396 --> 01:37.262
Having loosed the
pains of death,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.131
Because it was not possible
that he should be holden of it.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.866
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

01:40.868 --> 01:42.801
<i>That it wasn't just about</i>
<i>chocolate eggs for jane.</i>

01:42.803 --> 01:46.271
<i>She had been raised</i>
<i>a devout catholic as well.</i>

01:49.409 --> 01:51.610
<i>But one year, her natural</i>
<i>curiosity combined with</i>

01:51.612 --> 01:54.213
<i>A penchant for overthinking</i>
<i>resulted in:</i>

01:54.215 --> 01:55.414
Really?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.815
He rose from the dead?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.550
And rolled a giant, heavy stone

01:58.552 --> 02:00.219
All by himself?
Priest: Please kneel.

02:02.555 --> 02:05.290
Behold the
lamb of god,

02:05.292 --> 02:06.825
Which taketh away the
sin of the world.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.727
Happy are those

02:08.729 --> 02:10.362
Who are called to his supper.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.830
Seriously?

02:11.832 --> 02:13.599
That stale cracker
from the deli

02:13.601 --> 02:16.135
Is supposed to be
the body of christ?

02:18.304 --> 02:20.439
Don't get mad, but...

02:20.441 --> 02:22.608
What if jesus' disciples
just thought he died,

02:22.610 --> 02:24.309
But he really didn't...

02:24.311 --> 02:26.845
So he actually
wasn't resurrected?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.548
He just kind of woke up.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.458
But what if he...

02:48.468 --> 02:50.202
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which made sense to jane.</i>

02:50.204 --> 02:52.738
<i>So she vowed</i>
<i>to banish her doubts.</i>

02:52.740 --> 02:56.742
<i>But some doubts are more</i>
<i>difficult to shake.</i>

02:56.744 --> 02:59.811
(phone buzzing)
breathe, breathe.

03:02.715 --> 03:06.518
Oh, baby... I am so sorry,
I have to take this.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.720
(grunts, clears throat)
okay.

03:11.257 --> 03:14.259
I am so sorry. Hey, hold on,
stepping outside now.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.361
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane told herself</i>
<i>that it was okay.</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:17.629
<i>That call was important.</i>

03:17.631 --> 03:19.898
More important
than your baby?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.334
Latin lover narrator:
<i>She reminded herself</i>
<i>the hotel was in trouble.</i>

03:22.336 --> 03:25.370
<i>It was a one-time thing.</i>
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

03:25.372 --> 03:27.439
<i>Rafael had to get</i>
<i>the liquor license back.</i>

03:27.441 --> 03:29.641
It's always gonna be something.
Now let's move on

03:29.643 --> 03:31.877
To the standing

03:31.879 --> 03:33.946
Supported squat.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.781
Gonna take the squat position

03:35.783 --> 03:38.617
And let's
really lean

03:38.619 --> 03:41.954
Against our
partners, ladies.

03:43.623 --> 03:44.957
Get ready, jane.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.659
This is gonna be our life.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.400
Okay, you seem mad.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.236
I'm really not.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.837
Okay, disappointed, then.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.939
I just asked you
to turn it off for an hour.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.276
I know, but hotels are 24-hour
things, and, look, I couldn't

04:04.278 --> 04:05.944
Miss that call. That
was graham falco.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.680
He's a family friend, his wife's
the city commissioner, and

04:08.682 --> 04:11.416
She could get our liquor
license hearing moved up.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.518
Graham suggested we talk
about it over dinner.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.554
So I guess that's a good thing.
Good.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.723
So I'm going to go and meet

04:17.725 --> 04:19.558
My other grandmother.
Hey.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.526
(laughs)

04:21.528 --> 04:23.562
Come over later?
Can't.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.931
We are 48 hours out
and there is some

04:25.933 --> 04:27.833
Hard-core easter prep
going down tonight.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.736
Well, I am excited
for my first villanueva

04:30.738 --> 04:32.971
Family easter.
Me, too.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.474
He'll definitely
have his phone on.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.345
Xiomara: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>if this is working.</i>

04:42.482 --> 04:45.584
What is it?
An aromatherapy diffuser.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.487
Rogelio wants the whole place to
smell like lavender for his mom.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.355
Seems slightly excessive.
Oh, no,

04:50.357 --> 04:52.924
Excessive is his list.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.702
Are they displayed
lovingly enough?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.571
Mom. It's gonna be okay.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.508
What happened... Well,
it was a long time ago.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.009
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I should probably explain.</i>

05:11.011 --> 05:13.612
<i>In 1991, rogelio's mom</i>
<i>walked in on them</i>

05:13.614 --> 05:15.614
<i>In flagrante, so to speak.</i>

05:15.616 --> 05:17.849
<i>And she was so shocked,</i>
<i>she tripped on a lamp cord.</i>

05:17.851 --> 05:20.852
<i>The lamp fell, electrocuting</i>
<i>her cat, gordito.</i>

05:20.854 --> 05:22.521
(buzzing, cat yowls)

05:22.523 --> 05:24.723
She's always gonna hate me.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.092
Rogelio:
We're home.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.696
Mom. You can do this.
Win her back.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.397
Yeah.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.801
Jane, xiomara,

05:35.803 --> 05:38.704
Here is my glorious mother.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.512
Oh, my beautiful

05:47.514 --> 05:49.014
Granddaughter.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.750
(gasps) oh, let me
look at you, no, I can't,

05:51.752 --> 05:54.519
I have to
hug you first. Oh!

05:54.521 --> 05:57.422
If only there were a way
to capture this moment

05:57.424 --> 05:59.424
And freeze it in time.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.992
Take a picture.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.462
Of course.
You've got
so much

06:03.464 --> 06:05.731
De la vega
in your face.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.932
Thank god.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.068
(laughs)
oh, xiomara. Hello.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.903
Did that offend you?

06:11.905 --> 06:14.906
That I thanked the lord
for my beautiful grandchild?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.475
Wh-what? No.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.145
No? Oh, well, you
rolled your eyes.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.681
I was just looking
to heaven,

06:22.683 --> 06:25.050
To thank god for
bringing you here.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.953
My mom and my other grandma
would love

06:27.955 --> 06:30.021
To have you over
for easter, right, mom?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.491
Yes. We'd love to have you.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.627
Perfect.
That would be so wonderful.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.763
So, rogelio,

06:37.765 --> 06:40.098
Show me your enormous home.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.900
Of course.
Stand up straight.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.971
You must really love

06:45.973 --> 06:47.973
Living here, huh?

06:47.975 --> 06:50.041
Quite the upgrade,
I'm sure.

06:52.111 --> 06:55.447
(mouthing)
stay calm, she's only
here for a week.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.115
(exhales)

06:57.117 --> 06:58.984
You're right.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.786
I can handle it.
Mm-hmm.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.121
I can't handle it.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.991
Look, I agree, she
took some cheap shots.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.993
No, she had rogelio
make a dinner reservation

07:07.995 --> 07:09.861
Just for the two
of them. And

07:09.863 --> 07:12.497
She called my singing
career a little hobby.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.733
Screw her. If she doesn't
like me, well, guess what.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.801
I don't like her.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.202
Okay, stop. Stop.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.804
You see, this is what you do.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.138
You get insulted and then

07:20.140 --> 07:22.073
You self-sabotage.
No, I don't.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.783
Jesus never met
liliana de la vega.
Ma,

07:31.785 --> 07:34.486
If you feel yourself getting
worked up, just take nice,

07:34.488 --> 07:36.555
Slow, deep breaths.

07:39.692 --> 07:41.026
Learned that
in childbirth class.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.762
Oh, yeah, that's right,
I forgot about that.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.097
Did you and rafael have fun?

07:46.099 --> 07:48.700
Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that at this
<i>moment, jane desperately</i>

07:48.702 --> 07:51.570
<i>Wanted to talk to her mother,</i>
<i>tell her about her doubts.</i>

07:51.572 --> 07:54.039
<i>But she also didn't want</i>
<i>to hear "I told you so."</i>

07:54.041 --> 07:57.108
Yeah. We did have fun.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.245
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But still, jane knew</i>
<i>she had to talk to someone.</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:04.983
<i>Yeah. Not the greatest choice.</i>

08:04.985 --> 08:07.652
<i>You'll recall,</i>
<i>when we last saw andie,</i>

08:07.654 --> 08:10.088
<i>She was reconnecting</i>
<i>with her ex-boyfriend...</i>

08:10.090 --> 08:11.756
I heard you and jane broke up.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.592
<i>...Who was also jane's</i>

08:13.594 --> 08:16.528
<i>Ex-boyfriend, though</i>
<i>jane didn't know that yet.</i>

08:16.530 --> 08:17.896
You look nice.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.098
I just saw my ex.
Ooh!

08:20.100 --> 08:21.833
Tomorrow night he's
taking me to tresoro,

08:21.835 --> 08:22.934
That place by the beach.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.237
Third night in a row?
Mm-hmm.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.905
Ugh.
(laughs) sorry.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.040
Can we talk, actually?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.976
I kind of need to vent.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.545
And it's hard to talk to
people in my day-to-day life,

08:33.547 --> 08:35.881
Because then it'll
become a thing,

08:35.883 --> 08:38.250
And I just don't know
if it's a thing yet.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.118
Okay, what's going on?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.955
I'm having all these... Doubts

08:43.957 --> 08:45.190
About rafael.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.825
What kind of doubts?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.226
Like, high-level ones.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.262
Like, do we want the
same things in life?

08:50.264 --> 08:51.997
Do we see our lives
the same way?

08:51.999 --> 08:54.199
And with michael--

08:54.201 --> 08:55.567
My ex...

08:55.569 --> 08:57.002
Anyway, this is not about him,

08:57.004 --> 08:59.004
Except to say that we
wanted the same things.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.010
And with rafael, I don't...
I-I'm not sure that we do.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.245
It's probably hormones.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.748
Oh.
My sister
totally freaked out

09:09.750 --> 09:11.816
On my brother-in-law
when she was pregnant.

09:11.818 --> 09:15.153
And once she had the baby,
things went back to normal.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.589
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.792
Just don't do anything rash.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.262
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so jane did her best</i>

09:24.264 --> 09:26.631
<i>To ignore her doubts</i>
<i>about rafael.</i>

09:26.633 --> 09:30.302
<i>She blamed it on hormones.</i>
<i>(whoosh)</i>

09:30.304 --> 09:32.571
<i>Even when this happened.</i>

09:36.142 --> 09:39.578
Yup. Called that one.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.050
Woman:
Excuse me.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.586
Excuse me, miss?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.888
Finally. I've been trying
to get your attention

09:49.890 --> 09:51.856
Forever, but you were too busy
checking your phone.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.292
I'm sorry. It's just been
one of those days.

09:54.294 --> 09:58.029
Oh, please. Pregnant
and apparently unmarried

09:58.031 --> 09:59.731
Is not an excuse
for poor service.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.132
Excuse me?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.667
In any case,
now that I have you here,

10:02.669 --> 10:03.902
My arnold palmer is too tart

10:03.904 --> 10:05.303
And my knife
is dirty.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.871
Do you think you could
take care of that

10:06.873 --> 10:08.807
Or do you need
to consult your phone first?

10:08.809 --> 10:10.775
Can you maybe just not be rude?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.077
Excuse me?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.645
I get it.
I was on the phone,

10:13.647 --> 10:15.914
And I am really sorry.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.649
But I'm also a person,

10:17.651 --> 10:20.051
And it would be nice if you
talked to me like one.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.953
I could get you fired.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.889
I'd like to see you try.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.791
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Go, jane.</i>

10:26.793 --> 10:28.093
You okay?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.961
Yeah. I just had

10:29.963 --> 10:31.830
The rudest customer ever.
I mean,

10:31.832 --> 10:33.331
Seriously,
this woman was

10:33.333 --> 10:35.700
The worst human
being in the world.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.168
That sounds really bad.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.105
Oh.
Hey. Uh, jane,
this is graham falco.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.806
He's the family friend that
I'm having dinner with tonight.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.075
And, graham, this is
my girlfriend, jane.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.044
Nice to meet you.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.380
You, too. And I'm sorry
you overheard...
Oh, not at all.

10:48.382 --> 10:49.948
I'm sorry
you had such a rude customer.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.182
There's alexis.

10:58.224 --> 10:59.357
We might have
a problem.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.693
Graham:
This is rafael and jane.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.828
We've already met.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.264
I don't think I'm up for
dinner tonight after all.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.099
Jane can explain.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.079
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.114
No, I know.
How do I fix it?

11:23.116 --> 11:25.884
An apology letter.
I write good apology letters.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.687
(sighs)
let-let me think about it, okay?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.288
I'll figure something out.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.991
Narrator:
<i>Not the answer</i>
<i>he was looking for.</i>

11:32.993 --> 11:34.426
<i>But it was an answer,</i>
<i>all the same.</i>

11:34.428 --> 11:36.728
<i>From a private investigator</i>
<i>he hired.</i>

11:39.298 --> 11:41.299
(door opens)

11:41.301 --> 11:42.867
Why are you ignoring my calls?

11:42.869 --> 11:46.071
(door shuts)
I've just...

11:46.073 --> 11:49.207
(sighs)
I've just been busy
working an angle to try to get

11:49.209 --> 11:50.842
This liquor license hearing
moved up.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.143
Great.
And in the meantime,

11:52.145 --> 11:53.344
Aaron tells me
he's leaving to go back

11:53.346 --> 11:54.813
To india in three days.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.048
We have to call the police. Now.
Petra, stop.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.384
Aaron is not roman.
Look, he obviously

11:59.386 --> 12:01.252
Lured his brother out here
somehow,

12:01.254 --> 12:03.221
Killed him,
and now he's taking his place.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.355
Are you even hearing yourself?

12:04.357 --> 12:05.957
I know it sounds crazy...
Look,

12:05.959 --> 12:08.226
You asked me to have a drink
with him, and I did.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.096
Trust me,
that is not the same guy

12:11.098 --> 12:13.098
That I shared a room with
in college.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.899
It's not him.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.235
So finally I just had to get
the operation, you know,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.504
Because I couldn't
take long walks anymore.
Mmm.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.040
I mean, why live in miami
if you can't

12:22.042 --> 12:23.775
Take long walks?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.844
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes. Remember edward?</i>

12:31.817 --> 12:33.284
I'll see you next Saturday,
I hope?

12:35.221 --> 12:37.188
Bye-bye.
Bye.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.156
(honking horn)

12:39.792 --> 12:42.794
So, did you drop the hint

12:42.796 --> 12:45.130
About the new peruvian
place on ocean?

12:54.140 --> 12:57.876
Okay. Got it.
Xiomara: <i>Maybe you could star</i>
<i>in your own telenovela, ma.</i>

12:57.878 --> 13:00.278
Rehabilitated love.
(jane laughs)

13:03.315 --> 13:05.483
Hey, wait, save some flour
for my pan dulce.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.352
<i>Lo harÃ©, lo harÃ©.</i>

13:07.354 --> 13:09.087
The more food
the better.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.189
Let's put liliana
in a food coma.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.258
Or, better yet, a real one.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.165
We got to tag-team, okay?
Make sure that she stays calm.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.234
(phone rings)
mm.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.236
Hey, baby.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.439
So... I hate to ask this...

13:28.441 --> 13:30.175
Ask what?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.376
So, I talked to graham,

13:31.378 --> 13:34.179
And there's this easter thing

13:34.181 --> 13:36.514
Where they all go to church
and then they have brunch

13:36.516 --> 13:38.049
At the golden harbor yacht club.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.051
Where we met...

13:40.053 --> 13:42.320
Yeah. I remember.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.323
Anyway, he invited me. Well, us.
(laughing)

13:45.325 --> 13:49.060
I know how important your easter
is and I would never ask,

13:49.062 --> 13:52.363
Except that the falcos are
traveling overseas next week,

13:52.365 --> 13:54.866
And if you could just smooth
things over with mrs. Falco,

13:54.868 --> 13:56.401
Then maybe they can move up
the liquor license hearing.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.370
The hotel is struggling, jane,

13:59.372 --> 14:02.440
Without our liquor license.
No, I get it.

14:02.442 --> 14:06.411
I'll come, of course.
Liliana:
<i>Oh, what a disappointment.</i>

14:06.413 --> 14:09.347
I know. And I'm so sorry.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.549
It's just I really screwed up
with this woman,

14:11.551 --> 14:14.085
And it's my only chance
to smooth things over.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.420
No, I-I understand.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.388
And I think it's wonderful

14:17.390 --> 14:19.457
You're standing
by your man.

14:25.397 --> 14:28.933
(chuckles)
and speaking of...

14:28.935 --> 14:31.202
Rogelio's looking thirsty.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.070
Rogelio:
I'm slightly parched.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.338
Ah.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.939
(chuckles)

14:34.941 --> 14:36.507
Room temperature water.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.444
Two lemons.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.581
Alba, you are just
as I remembered.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.583
EstÃ¡s igualita...

14:45.585 --> 14:48.186
Behave yourself.

14:48.188 --> 14:52.423
I won't be here,
but I'll know.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.225
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And petra knew</i>
<i>that she needed proof</i>

14:54.227 --> 14:56.494
<i>That aaron was really roman.</i>

14:59.164 --> 15:01.032
(clears throat)

15:01.034 --> 15:02.967
Aaron. Hi.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.036
Where are you?
Do you want to grab some lunch?

15:05.038 --> 15:06.271
Uh, I'm just on my way out.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.273
I won't be back for a few hours.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.308
Oh. Oh. That's too bad.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.443
Dinner later?
Uh, in the lounge?

15:12.445 --> 15:15.046
Perfect.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.950
(exhales)

15:35.200 --> 15:36.234
(door opening)

15:38.604 --> 15:41.639
Latin lover narrator:
Wait. I thought he was leaving.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.217
Hi. Sorry.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.053
Yeah, I'll-I'll be down
in a second.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.321
I, um...

15:56.323 --> 15:58.623
I, uh, forgot my wallet.
(chuckles)

15:58.625 --> 16:00.091
Okay.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.560
(door shuts)

16:06.231 --> 16:09.100
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Whoa. He missed her by a hair.</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:11.035
Petra:
<i>Michael.</i>

16:11.037 --> 16:12.971
Hi. It's petra.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.573
I need you to come meet me
at the marbella.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.176
It's important.

16:23.416 --> 16:27.251
Why aren't you at church
with your family?

16:27.253 --> 16:30.254
Oh, I'm just going
to a different church this year.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.290
With rafael.
What are you doing here?

16:32.292 --> 16:33.391
Oh, I have a meeting.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.360
Must be some meeting.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.128
You're wearing
your date sweater.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.263
Oh. Okay. Well,

16:39.265 --> 16:41.265
First of all,
this isn't just a date sweater.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.400
And second
of all,

16:42.402 --> 16:44.102
I do have a date.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.470
With my ex.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.105
Andrea. Or andie,

16:47.107 --> 16:48.106
I guess
she goes by now.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.174
Andie?
Yeah.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.443
Narrator:
<i>Jane told herself</i>
<i>that it was just a coincidence,</i>

16:52.445 --> 16:55.113
<i>That it couldn't be</i>
<i>the same woman.</i>

16:55.115 --> 16:57.181
Where-where are you going?

16:57.183 --> 16:58.483
Anywhere special?

16:58.485 --> 17:01.486
Uh, tresoro.
This new place by the beach.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.154
Tomorrow night
he's taking me to tresoro,

17:03.156 --> 17:04.422
That place by the beach.

17:04.424 --> 17:09.027
After she saw you and I
broke up on facebook.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.695
I guess
she's been lightly stalkin' me.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.530
Well, that's what she said,
anyway, but...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.065
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yeah, not so lightly.</i>

17:14.067 --> 17:17.468
Look, michael, I...
Rafael:
Hey.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.570
Are you ready to go?

17:19.572 --> 17:22.707
Mm-hmm.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.476
Happy easter, michael.
Yeah, you, too.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.312
Look, if you're upset
that michael was at the hotel,

17:28.314 --> 17:29.747
I'm sorry. That...

17:29.749 --> 17:31.482
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not it.

17:33.318 --> 17:37.288
My private investigator found
an e-mail address for my mother.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.490
What? When?
Yesterday.

17:39.492 --> 17:43.761
(sighs)
it's kind of thrown me
for a-a loop since then.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.365
Because I just keep going back,
remembering the last time

17:47.367 --> 17:48.833
That I
saw her.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.301
(sighs)

17:50.303 --> 17:52.170
Anyway, uh...

17:52.172 --> 17:54.172
I don't even know
if she'd even respond.

17:55.507 --> 17:58.209
That would be
awful.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.345
But I guess

18:01.347 --> 18:03.347
The question is...

18:03.349 --> 18:05.450
Is that worse than not knowing?

18:05.452 --> 18:08.252
I mean, for me,
growing up without a dad,

18:08.254 --> 18:11.155
I never stopped wondering
who he was.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.424
Yeah. I know.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.593
And I heard your voice

18:15.595 --> 18:16.794
In my head
saying that

18:16.796 --> 18:21.332
When I was trying
to decide what to do.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.568
So I e-mailed her.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.802
Really?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.471
Yeah.

18:26.473 --> 18:30.208
No response
yet but...

18:30.210 --> 18:32.877
I think it's good.

18:32.879 --> 18:36.214
I really do.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.354
(sighs)
there are the falcos.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.889
(speaking indistinctly)

18:44.891 --> 18:46.491
Graham:
Well, you look fantastic.
It's good to see you.

18:49.695 --> 18:53.564
(bells clanging)
man:
Welcome to holy trinity.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.633
Welcome to
holy trinity.

19:05.777 --> 19:09.480
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Wow. God really does work</i>
<i>in mysterious ways.</i>

19:13.485 --> 19:16.487
Fine.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.391
I'll apologize if you call
rehab guy and ask him out.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.593
(sighs)
okay.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.628
Really?

19:23.630 --> 19:24.662
Geez, I
didn't think

19:24.664 --> 19:26.197
You'd say yes.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.800
Liliana: <i>Â¿te gusta?</i>
<i>Rogelio:</i> <i>MuchÃ­simo.</i>

19:29.802 --> 19:32.470
(sighs)

19:34.640 --> 19:36.774
Mrs. De la vega,

19:36.776 --> 19:40.778
Look, I-I just want to
clear the air before we go.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.181
I'm really sorry
about everything.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.916
Especially your cat.

19:44.918 --> 19:48.853
And I hope that we can
start over and move on.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.955
That is a beautiful
sentiment, xiomara.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.391
Forgiveness is one
of my mother's

19:53.393 --> 19:55.893
Many wonderful qualities.
It is.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.462
Look, I can forgive the cat.

19:58.464 --> 20:02.633
Even though the stench
of gordito's scorched fur

20:02.635 --> 20:05.336
Will forever haunt me.
(buzzing, cat yowls)

20:05.338 --> 20:08.339
But I cannot forgive the fact

20:08.341 --> 20:11.209
That you never told my son

20:11.211 --> 20:13.344
That you were pregnant.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.879
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Wait. But she did.</i>

20:14.881 --> 20:16.414
Excuse me?
And

20:16.416 --> 20:17.982
As a result,
you deprived me

20:17.984 --> 20:20.351
Of my granddaughter.

20:20.353 --> 20:23.621
And rogelio didn't get
to raise his child.

20:23.623 --> 20:28.259
I am sorry,
but I cannot get past that.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.261
Let's go! We shouldn't...
We'll be late for church,

20:30.263 --> 20:31.662
Especially on easter.
Well, okay...

20:33.432 --> 20:35.366
Why does she think
I never told you I was pregnant?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.701
My mother sees me a certain way,

20:36.703 --> 20:38.502
And I don't want
to disappoint her.

20:38.504 --> 20:39.704
You know how much
her approval means.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.739
Well, what about
her approval of me?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.474
You said that was the only thing
holding you back

20:43.476 --> 20:45.743
From saying "I love you."
you're sabotaging us.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.312
I meant to tell her.
I mean, I will. I will.

20:48.314 --> 20:48.946
When?

20:48.948 --> 20:51.449
On her deathbed.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.317
Bad joke. I'm sorry.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.385
I'm very nervous. I'm sorry.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.653
I will. I promise I'll tell her.

20:55.655 --> 21:00.424
Tomorrow. Today is a holy day.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.828
I cannot say the word
"abortion" on easter.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.596
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It seems that rogelio can be</i>
<i>very religious</i>

21:05.598 --> 21:07.431
<i>When it suits him.</i>

21:07.433 --> 21:09.400
<i>And also praying</i>
<i>for a miracle-- rafael,</i>

21:09.402 --> 21:12.336
<i>Who needed jane to make things</i>
<i>right with mrs. Falco.</i>

21:12.338 --> 21:14.272
Jane:
There she is.

21:14.274 --> 21:18.976
Uh... Now go smoke a cigar or
whatever you do at a yacht club.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.011
You got this?
Mm-hmm.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.279
Thank you.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.615
Mrs. Falco?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.417
Hi.
Jane.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.818
I heard you
were coming.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.987
I'm about to have
lunch with my friends.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.622
Care to join?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.024
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ew. That looks like torture.</i>

21:33.026 --> 21:34.759
I would love that.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.662
And-and I just wanted
to say, about the other day...

21:37.664 --> 21:40.898
I was having a moment,
and... I took it out on you,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.800
And I am really so sorry.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.303
Are you really
so sorry?

21:45.305 --> 21:47.838
Or do you want me to help with
your boyfriend's liquor license?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.608
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Maybe a little of both?</i>

21:55.614 --> 21:57.348
Please, just run
the fingerprints.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.749
You've been investigating
roman's murder for months.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.818
I mean, maybe the reason
you can't solve it

22:00.820 --> 22:03.087
Is because he isn't really dead.
Roman had a record.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.423
We have his prints
on file. I'll run them.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.726
We're supposed to be having
dinner tonight... In the lounge.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.061
You'll be fine.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.896
I'll have eyes down there.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.932
But the second we get a
positive match... We'll move.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.636
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Man, that is going</i>
<i>to be one awkward meal.</i>

22:18.638 --> 22:20.071
<i>Much like this one.</i>

22:20.073 --> 22:21.906
Ladies, this is jane...

22:21.908 --> 22:24.375
What is your last name?
Villanueva.

22:24.377 --> 22:28.646
Mm. Are you related to the
very famous bolivian architect?

22:28.648 --> 22:30.414
Oh, no, not that I know of.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.450
Alexis:
Ladies, what have we missed?

22:32.452 --> 22:33.784
Just discussing the travesty

22:33.786 --> 22:35.019
That was art basel.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.754
I mean, it's become too much

22:36.756 --> 22:38.756
Around the parties. No
one's interested in the art.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.491
Well, unless
jay jopling wants something.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.826
Then everyone pounces.
Oh.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.562
Alexis:
Interesting. Jane,

22:44.564 --> 22:47.431
What do you think?

22:48.633 --> 22:50.935
Well, I've heard

22:50.937 --> 22:53.471
That the art berlin contemporary
is the place to be

22:53.473 --> 22:55.005
If you really want to talk art.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.441
Apparently, berlin gets
all the big ones--

22:57.443 --> 22:59.510
Martin eder,
christian jankowski...

22:59.512 --> 23:01.979
You're so
right, jane!

23:01.981 --> 23:03.981
But it was controversial
to include james moses

23:03.983 --> 23:05.850
As a judge
at the westminster dog show.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.853
New botanical garden
is just breathtaking.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.122
I think an elegant piaffe

23:11.124 --> 23:14.992
Is the most underrated movement
in dressage.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.061
Latin lover narrator:
<i>What? Did you doubt jane?</i>

23:18.964 --> 23:21.832
(computer dinging)

23:21.834 --> 23:23.000
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>she was an "a" student.</i>

23:23.002 --> 23:26.604
<i>She always did her homework.</i>

23:26.606 --> 23:28.939
What a wonderful lunch companion
you've brought us,

23:28.941 --> 23:30.574
Alexis.
<i>Only one problem.</i>

23:30.576 --> 23:32.843
<i>It seems the more jane charms</i>

23:32.845 --> 23:36.414
<i>These ladies, the more</i>
<i>irritated alexis is becoming.</i>

23:36.416 --> 23:38.549
<i>Which does make sense</i>
<i>considering she's...</i>

23:40.118 --> 23:42.019
<i>Xiomara may have had</i>
<i>a different opinion</i>

23:42.021 --> 23:43.721
<i>On who deserved that title.</i>

23:43.723 --> 23:47.892
So, rogelio tells me
that you do not like to cook.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.560
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Of course at that moment,</i>

23:49.562 --> 23:51.128
<i>She wasn't sure</i>
<i>which de la vega it was.</i>

23:51.130 --> 23:53.597
Though now, I guess
you have my son's chef.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.099
Why would you need to?

23:55.101 --> 23:58.602
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, it's the mother.</i>

23:58.604 --> 24:01.038
Mom, that's enough.
Â¿quÃ©?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.707
Xiomara is not the person
you should be angry at.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.943
You should be angry at me.

24:05.945 --> 24:09.513
Rogelio, what is it?

24:09.515 --> 24:13.217
NiÃ±o... Inhala.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.586
Exhala.

24:17.856 --> 24:22.793
<i>SÃ­.</i> Xiomara did tell
me she was pregnant.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.128
And I...

24:24.130 --> 24:27.531
Told her she should
get an abortion.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.600
And also a perm.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.203
But the abortion was
a way worse part.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.205
So you cannot blame her
for not wanting

24:34.207 --> 24:36.140
To get back in touch with me.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.543
How could you not tell me this?

24:39.545 --> 24:41.078
I was ashamed.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.481
And you know I don't
want to disappoint you.

24:44.616 --> 24:47.918
Well... You have.

24:50.689 --> 24:53.557
It's your daughter's
birthday, graham.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.092
It only happens
once a year.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.962
I know, but we're closing
on a tech deal in palo alto.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.964
Will your mistress
be there?

24:59.966 --> 25:03.534
Yes. She will.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.936
Do you want a divorce?

25:07.038 --> 25:09.607
I didn't think so.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.212
(clears throat)

25:15.214 --> 25:18.015
How much of that did you hear?

25:18.017 --> 25:22.052
Well, um... Most...
All of it.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.821
I heard all of it.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.123
We have a reputation

25:26.125 --> 25:27.958
Here at the club.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.728
Perhaps, in exchange
for your silence,

25:30.730 --> 25:34.098
I will help your boyfriend
with his liquor license.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.067
Regardless of the liquor
license, I'd never say anything.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.671
I suppose
I seem pathetic to you.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.239
No, you don't.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.676
And you should know,
I grew up without a father.

25:45.678 --> 25:48.646
And the one thing I remember
about my birthdays is,

25:48.648 --> 25:50.314
My mom was there.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.650
And that's what your daughter
will remember, too.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.985
Thank you.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.288
And I, um...

25:57.290 --> 25:59.590
I owe you an apology

25:59.592 --> 26:00.925
For lashing out at
you the other day.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.192
I was having...

26:02.194 --> 26:06.130
Well... A moment.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.732
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>jane realized</i>

26:08.734 --> 26:11.201
<i>That mrs. Falco</i> wasn't
<i>the worst person in the world.</i>

26:11.203 --> 26:13.737
<i>She was just a person.</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:16.173
But that knife was very filthy.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.342
<i>Though clearly</i>
<i>not a perfect one.</i>

26:18.344 --> 26:21.211
Xiomara, I want
to apologize.
No, you don't.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.748
Oh, yes, I do.
I was very rude to you.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.284
I blamed you for something
that you did not even do.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.687
I wish you had told me sooner,
but I understand...

26:29.689 --> 26:31.322
I understand
that you were scared, so...

26:31.324 --> 26:34.024
Thank you, mother.
I'm sorry, mother.
Yes, thank you.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.627
You see? I'm very reasonable.

26:36.629 --> 26:37.795
Which is why I hope

26:37.797 --> 26:39.163
You'll both listen

26:39.165 --> 26:42.032
When I tell you
to end this relationship.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.200
What?!
Mother!

26:43.202 --> 26:45.769
You two are not suited
to each other.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.205
You are both too headstrong
and too proud.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.807
That is not true.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.241
I pride myself
on not being too proud.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.810
Impetuous, then.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.345
You moved in together.

26:54.347 --> 26:56.647
What was the long-term plan?

26:56.649 --> 26:59.950
Did you talk about it?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.952
Well, not specifically.

27:01.954 --> 27:06.390
Xiomara, you had
a little girl.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.993
You got to raise her.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.995
Don't you want that for rogelio?

27:12.697 --> 27:15.032
I mean, if he wants it...

27:15.034 --> 27:18.035
More children?
Of course I do.
You do?

27:18.037 --> 27:20.270
But not for a number of years.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.373
(sighs)
a number of years.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.675
Oh. I hate to
bring this up--

27:24.677 --> 27:26.744
But I-I really do--
but I have to.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.079
Xiomara...

27:29.081 --> 27:31.015
How old are you?

27:31.017 --> 27:32.883
Excuse me?

27:32.885 --> 27:34.985
Don't you think, darling,

27:34.987 --> 27:38.422
That hearing what rogelio wants,
and when,

27:38.424 --> 27:40.891
Maybe you're a little bit
too old?

27:40.893 --> 27:42.159
You know what? I'm out of here.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.394
Xiomara, wait.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.295
Wait? You know what? I can't.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.798
Because otherwise, I'm gonna
say something to your mother

27:47.800 --> 27:50.901
That neither of us wants me
to say.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.904
How could you talk
to her like that?!
Listen.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.006
I was right
about wife number one.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.709
I was right
about wife number two.

27:58.711 --> 28:01.078
I know it's hard
to hear, darling,

28:01.080 --> 28:04.748
But I want to spare you
that pain of a third time.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.885
(sighing):
Oh.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.856
(phone dings)

28:12.858 --> 28:15.893
Did he just turn
his phone back on?

28:15.895 --> 28:17.294
(scoffs)

28:17.296 --> 28:19.096
So he can turn it off.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.864
He just gets
to choose the time.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.400
What?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.903
Nothing.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.272
It's just that you made
such a big deal before

28:28.274 --> 28:31.175
About how you can't
turn off your phone

28:31.177 --> 28:33.110
Because the hotel's 24 hours.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.411
It was important.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.013
Important to you.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.182
But what about the stuff
that's important to us?

28:38.184 --> 28:39.450
(sighs)

28:39.452 --> 28:42.920
What's going on?

28:45.023 --> 28:48.158
It's just... (sighs)

28:48.160 --> 28:50.728
The life where the husband's
always gone

28:50.730 --> 28:54.131
And work always comes first--
I don't want that.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.466
Me neither.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.735
You know how important
family is to me.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.739
Okay, now you look
disappointed again.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.073
Because I want
to be successful.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.408
I'm being realistic.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.943
It comes with a cost.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.244
And I would be
providing for our child.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.812
Like your father
provided for you,

29:08.814 --> 29:10.514
Except he was
always gone, and...

29:10.516 --> 29:12.349
I'd rather have you.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.418
I'm not like my father.
I know. That's why

29:14.420 --> 29:17.087
I don't want you getting sucked
into living his life.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.958
It's not that simple.
I never said it was simple.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.094
Anyway, I should just go help
my grandma clean up easter.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.763
I'll see you later.

29:26.831 --> 29:29.466
(door opens, door closes)

29:34.773 --> 29:36.373
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, xiomara.</i>

29:36.375 --> 29:38.509
<i>She was trying to get rogelio</i>
<i>out of her mind,</i>

29:38.511 --> 29:40.978
<i>Which was easier said</i>
<i>than done.</i>

29:40.980 --> 29:42.846
Can you turn that off?

29:42.848 --> 29:45.149
Thanks.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.550
Another white wine, please.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.119
Xiomara?

29:51.856 --> 29:53.190
Hi.
Hi.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.858
It's been...

29:54.860 --> 29:56.894
A few months. Yeah.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.797
I've never seen you
in here before.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.866
I-I just moved
to the neighborhood.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.535
In with rogelio.

30:04.537 --> 30:07.037
Wow.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.273
Well, congratulations.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.275
That's a big step.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.844
Yeah. Thanks.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.582
Things are going well, then?

30:18.584 --> 30:20.050
With rogelio?

30:20.052 --> 30:22.152
Oh, yeah. (laughs)

30:22.154 --> 30:26.023
So, why are
you here? Alone?

30:26.025 --> 30:27.958
Jane:
<i>And mom behaved?</i>

30:33.164 --> 30:35.165
Abuela.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.901
Everything okay?

30:41.339 --> 30:43.407
(trilling)
who?

30:47.178 --> 30:48.912
(church bell chimes)

30:48.914 --> 30:51.248
Abuela?
Mm-hmm.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.584
Here's the thing.

30:53.586 --> 30:56.053
Um...

30:56.055 --> 30:58.522
Edward's a priest.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.126
I saw him at holy trinity.
He's a priest.

31:09.968 --> 31:12.035
Oh!
I'm sorry, abuela.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.303
<i>Ay.</i>

31:15.940 --> 31:18.442
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ooh.</i> Rehabilitated love,

31:18.444 --> 31:20.611
Thorn birds <i>edition.</i>

31:20.613 --> 31:23.280
<i>And it seems</i>
<i>forbidden love is in the air.</i>

31:23.282 --> 31:25.015
Rogelio should have
made <i>her</i> leave.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.251
I'm serious.

31:27.253 --> 31:30.187
If someone had spoken to you
like that in front of me,

31:30.189 --> 31:33.123
Made you feel any less than the
incredible woman that you are...

31:33.125 --> 31:36.193
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that if jane were here,</i>

31:36.195 --> 31:38.562
<i>She would tell xo to stop,</i>
<i>not to self-sabotage.</i>

31:38.564 --> 31:40.430
Well, I'd never let that happen.

31:40.432 --> 31:43.967
<i>But alas, jane was not here.</i>

31:43.969 --> 31:46.203
â™ª

31:50.975 --> 31:53.176
I shouldn't have done that.

31:53.178 --> 31:54.278
Xo...

31:54.280 --> 31:55.612
I'm sorry.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.214
I should go.

32:04.389 --> 32:06.356
Not good.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.659
I just think we're
so different, abuela.

32:08.661 --> 32:11.361
And today-- I mean, it's,
like, a extreme example--

32:11.363 --> 32:14.131
But I just saw my life
unfolding like that.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.533
You know, he's never
around, I resent it,

32:16.535 --> 32:18.568
Make compromises.

32:20.571 --> 32:23.140
(sighs): Ah... That
he'll be there,

32:23.142 --> 32:25.142
That everything
will work out.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.010
(crickets chirping softly)

32:27.012 --> 32:29.279
But I don't think
I believe that.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.081
Because practically...

32:44.562 --> 32:46.163
Who?

32:46.165 --> 32:47.564
Rafael.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.967
What are you
doing here?

32:51.169 --> 32:53.236
I wanted to see your face.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.577
About rafael?
Yes.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.446
Like you predicted.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.681
Latin lover narrator: <i>But</i>
<i>to her surprise, xiomara said:</i>

33:04.683 --> 33:07.451
Don't let doubts get in the way.

33:11.122 --> 33:12.990
(sighs)

33:12.992 --> 33:14.992
You know how I...

33:14.994 --> 33:16.660
Self-sabotage and
start getting

33:16.662 --> 33:18.662
All self-righteous
and acting out?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.163
Well, this is
how <i>you</i> do it.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.132
You start to
doubt things.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.701
Because I see very clearly
what's in front of me.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.137
And if you look at something
through that doubting lens,

33:27.139 --> 33:29.239
Well... It <i>will</i> fall apart.

33:29.241 --> 33:32.609
Think about how
quickly you ended
things with michael

33:32.611 --> 33:34.711
When you started to doubt him.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.480
That's true.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.650
But that's not the reason
that I broke up with michael.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.319
I broke up with michael

33:42.321 --> 33:44.421
Because I was falling in love
with rafael.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.289
That was before you
really knew him.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.424
Xiomara:
So...

33:47.426 --> 33:49.192
Think about those qualities--

33:49.194 --> 33:50.794
The reason you fell for him.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.063
But are they enough?

33:59.203 --> 34:01.071
Well, that would be
foolish, because...

34:01.073 --> 34:02.239
(shrieks)

34:02.241 --> 34:05.308
â™ª

34:05.310 --> 34:07.444
You're right.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.280
Thank you.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.118
Thanks.
And good news--

34:15.120 --> 34:17.220
We got our hearing pushed up,
so we should have

34:17.222 --> 34:19.389
Our liquor license back
by the end of next week.

34:22.326 --> 34:25.662
â™ª

34:25.664 --> 34:28.565
Rafael?

34:34.405 --> 34:35.472
Mom.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.679
I heard about your
father's passing.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.214
I'm so sorry.

34:44.216 --> 34:47.417
(takes deep breath)

34:47.419 --> 34:50.087
Our relationship was, um...

34:50.089 --> 34:52.289
Complicated.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.224
He was very proud of you.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.692
He wrote me
this letter.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.828
I thought you might want it.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.863
You were 18,

34:59.865 --> 35:02.599
Graduating
high school.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.501
It's full of
all these...

35:04.503 --> 35:06.269
Hopes for you, really.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.771
Things he wanted you

35:07.773 --> 35:09.673
To accomplish.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.175
Sanibel island?

35:12.177 --> 35:14.377
Is that where you live?

35:14.379 --> 35:15.512
(softly):
Yes.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.282
(choked up): That's less
than three hours away.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.686
I know. And I know
you must have so many questions.
Yeah, I do.

35:22.688 --> 35:26.123
Like, why'd you leave?

35:26.125 --> 35:28.725
Why didn't you... Get in touch?

35:28.727 --> 35:31.328
Look, y-your father and I...

35:31.330 --> 35:34.531
We were a mistake
from the beginning.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.168
So different.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.469
It was a...

35:39.471 --> 35:42.806
It was a whirlwind,
falling in love.

35:42.808 --> 35:46.743
But after that,
I-I wasn't happy.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.346
I'm not proud of it,
but I cheated on him.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.482
And after
he found out,

35:52.484 --> 35:54.618
He-he wanted me gone.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.256
Did you fight for me?

36:00.725 --> 36:04.728
He offered me $10 million
to go away...

36:04.730 --> 36:06.663
And I took it.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.732
â™ª

36:09.867 --> 36:11.668
What? What? He wanted...

36:11.670 --> 36:12.936
I promised

36:12.938 --> 36:15.939
Not to get in touch.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.608
And to survive...

36:18.610 --> 36:22.245
I had to... Put you
out of my head completely.

36:25.316 --> 36:27.651
Uh, I remarried.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.654
You actually have
a half brother.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.591
You know, it's funny.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.261
When I would think
about reaching out,

36:38.263 --> 36:40.363
I always thought
that the worst-case scenario

36:40.365 --> 36:42.732
Was that you
just wouldn't respond.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.770
(exhales)

36:48.573 --> 36:50.674
I was wrong.

36:57.915 --> 37:02.219
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking</i>
<i>of worst-case scenarios...</i>

37:02.221 --> 37:03.954
So...

37:03.956 --> 37:06.389
We need to talk.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.658
Yes, we do.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.361
I brought my mother
to the airport.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.363
She's on her way home.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.664
What?

37:14.666 --> 37:18.335
No one disrespects
the woman I love.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.670
You love me?

37:20.672 --> 37:22.772
I do.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.675
But what about all that stuff
that she said?

37:25.677 --> 37:27.644
Who cares if your eggs
are too old?

37:27.646 --> 37:30.480
We'll buy fresh ones.
Combine my dna with anyone,

37:30.482 --> 37:32.482
And the child
will be extraordinary.

37:33.684 --> 37:35.785
I love you, xiomara.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.921
I do.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.956
Latin lover narrator:
<i>So, really, how could</i>
<i>she tell him then</i>

37:39.958 --> 37:42.025
<i>About that one small kiss?</i>

37:42.027 --> 37:44.461
I love you, too.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.565
When are the fingerprint results
coming in?

37:48.567 --> 37:49.799
I'm supposed to be having dinner

37:49.801 --> 37:51.534
With aaron downstairs
in five minutes!

37:51.536 --> 37:53.036
I should get a call
from the lab any minute,

37:53.038 --> 37:54.571
And I'll call you
as soon as I hear.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.406
I'm already at the hotel.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.675
Got two guys in the lounge.
Just try to relax.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.310
Okay.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.646
Hey.

38:02.648 --> 38:06.449
More business here?
Oh, just waiting on a call.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.917
Cool.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.753
<i>Don't forget</i>
<i>to tell him about andie.</i>

38:09.755 --> 38:11.321
Hey, uh...

38:11.323 --> 38:13.890
Remember when we were talking
about your date?

38:13.892 --> 38:15.425
Yeah. Yeah.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.428
Um...
It was really
good, actually.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.430
It was probably the most fun
I've had since...

38:20.432 --> 38:21.598
You know, us.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.701
I know you've
been worried

38:24.703 --> 38:26.836
About me moving on
and all, and...

38:26.838 --> 38:30.040
With andie, I don't know,
I just feel... Like I am.

38:30.042 --> 38:31.574
Finally.

38:31.576 --> 38:33.543
<i>So, really,</i>
<i>how could she tell him?</i>

38:33.545 --> 38:35.945
I'm glad you're happy.

38:41.552 --> 38:43.887
Oh, no, the
restaurant's on two.
Oh, change of plans.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.823
I made a reservation
at a new place.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.696
(phone rings)
detective cordero.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.465
Petra? Where are you?
Call me back.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.834
Michael:
<i>You were right-- it's roman.</i>

38:57.836 --> 39:01.037
We're going a little fast,
aaron, don't you think?
Come on, baby.

39:04.408 --> 39:07.577
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Uh-oh. I guess</i>
<i>he didn't miss her by a hair.</i>

39:07.579 --> 39:09.412
I know you know who I am.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.950
(crickets chirping)

39:17.421 --> 39:18.922
Hey.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.359
Why didn't you pick up
your phone?

39:22.361 --> 39:23.460
I called, like, ten times.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.894
<i>Because his mom just dropped</i>

39:24.896 --> 39:26.763
<i>A $10 million bomb on him.</i>

39:26.765 --> 39:28.732
I just wasn't in
a talking mood.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.868
And I'm definitely not in
the mood for a lecture.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.703
No one's lecturing.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.505
I've-I've just been...

39:35.507 --> 39:37.006
Thinking about things.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.441
Overthinking.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.777
Letting my doubts
get in the way

39:40.779 --> 39:42.879
Instead of believing you.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.048
I know you're not your father.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.650
Well, maybe I am.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.919
And why is that a bad thing?

39:49.921 --> 39:51.755
He was there.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.390
He provided for me.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.392
I know that.
No, you don't.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.495
We're different people.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.797
Jane, we come
from different people.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.165
â™ª

40:02.167 --> 40:04.167
What are you talking about?

40:04.169 --> 40:06.903
I'm talking about who I am.

40:06.905 --> 40:10.473
Where I come from.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.809
I want to be successful.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.145
I want to leave something
for my child

40:15.147 --> 40:17.013
Like my father
left something for me,

40:17.015 --> 40:20.049
And right now I can't seem to do
that without disappointing you.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.185
That's not true.
It is.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.087
I am, all the time.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.789
We just have to find a balance.

40:25.791 --> 40:29.759
(sighs)
maybe you were right
this whole time.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.495
Maybe we <i>are</i> just too different.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.198
Maybe we should

40:35.200 --> 40:38.435
Stop trying to force
this relationship.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.036
â™ª

40:44.442 --> 40:46.443
What are you saying?

40:46.445 --> 40:48.511
â™ª

40:48.513 --> 40:50.180
(sets glass down)

40:51.115 --> 40:54.784
We have a baby coming.

40:54.786 --> 40:58.755
We both have to figure out
how to be good parents.

41:00.858 --> 41:03.593
Maybe that's enough to focus on.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.795
â™ª

41:08.199 --> 41:11.668
So... You want to break up.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.870
I think we should
take a break.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.072
You want to break up.

41:18.609 --> 41:21.744
If that's what
you want to call it.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.813
