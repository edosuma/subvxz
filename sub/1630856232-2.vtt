My name is Juliette Ojeda.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.781
Being from Miami is such a gift.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.842

on the radio,

mariachis and Hispanic artists.

at the airport, actually,

10:55.030 --> 10:57.407

nursing school.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.410

random construction jobs.

great, and I'm grateful.

to escape communism.

the stories he's gone through

11:08.710 --> 11:11.629

rivers, crossing borders.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.173

their entire lives

38:14.294 --> 38:15.754
Oh, my God.
Great job!

38:15.795 --> 38:17.964
Can I have a high five?
Yes!

Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

Whoo!

Okay!

38:28.558 --> 38:30.185
Oh, my gosh.
Who are you?

38:30.226 --> 38:32.520
My name is Ephraim Owens.

38:32.562 --> 38:34.189
How do you say your name?
Ephraim.

38:34.230 --> 38:36.274
Ephraim.
Ephraim. Okay.
Yes, ma'am.
It's biblical.

38:36.316 --> 38:37.984
Sorry, I'm --
Never mind.

38:38.026 --> 38:39.611
It's all good.
Let me just take this off

38:39.652 --> 38:41.529
so you can see
beneath my beautiful.

38:41.571 --> 38:42.614
Oh, okay, alright.

38:42.655 --> 38:45.367
Hey, whoa. Whoa.

38:45.408 --> 38:48.119
Is that legal?
I don't know.
What are you doing?

38:48.161 --> 38:50.413
No, he said he wants to see
beneath my beautiful.

38:55.794 --> 38:57.087
Okay, go ahead, Gwen.
Continue.

38:57.128 --> 38:59.589
Alright, well,
I love your voice so much.

38:59.631 --> 39:00.924
You kind of have
this soulfulness,

39:00.965 --> 39:03.718
but this, like,
rock side to you, too.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.888
I just feel super strong
that you should be on Team Gwen.

39:06.930 --> 39:08.723
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

39:08.765 --> 39:11.601
Ephraim, the word
I would use for it is angst.

39:11.643 --> 39:13.395
And when you feel angst
in a singer's voice,

39:13.436 --> 39:15.063
I think that's the best thing
you can have.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.232
Big songs like this
need big singers,

39:17.273 --> 39:19.401
and I have been on a show
like this myself.

39:19.442 --> 39:21.277
I would really appreciate
if you kept me in your mind

39:21.319 --> 39:22.904
when you're going
to pick your coach

39:22.946 --> 39:24.364

to have you on Team Niall.

Yes, ma'am.

39:32.622 --> 39:33.748
He said,
"Yes, ma'am."

39:33.790 --> 39:35.166
Yes, Mama Reba.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.584
When I found out

39:36.626 --> 39:37.961
who the coaches
were gonna be this year,

39:38.003 --> 39:40.422
my wife screamed
at the top of her lungs --

39:40.463 --> 39:41.423
When she heard my name.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.550
...and said, "Reba!"

39:43.591 --> 39:45.260
[ Laughter ]

39:45.301 --> 39:47.095
It's an honor to get
to hear you sing.

39:47.137 --> 39:49.848
Boy,
you are a firecracker.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.099
You were explosive.

39:51.141 --> 39:54.561
You were dynamic
all over the stage.

39:54.602 --> 39:55.937
Thank you
for the kind words,

39:55.979 --> 39:57.897
and I would love
to have you on Team Reba.

39:57.939 --> 39:59.274
We'd have a blast.

39:59.315 --> 40:03.194
I loved that performance.
He called it angst.

40:03.236 --> 40:04.821
I like to call it
urgency.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.198
And you were singing it
like your life depended on it,

40:07.240 --> 40:09.117
which is a powerful thing
to witness.

40:09.159 --> 40:11.953
It's very, like, mesmerizing
as an audience member.

40:11.995 --> 40:14.122
And not only did you
give us that feeling,

40:14.164 --> 40:17.667
but you were executing the song
with great skill

40:17.709 --> 40:19.794
as a vocalist, too,
at the same time.

40:19.836 --> 40:21.713
So,
congratulations on that.

40:21.755 --> 40:25.300
One of my inspirations
is you, sir.

40:25.342 --> 40:27.177
Oh. Thank you.

40:27.218 --> 40:29.054
My daughter sings
with me sometimes, too.

Do you want
to bring her out?

in my eyes *

favorite song, too.

the honor to coach you

will have so much fun
working with you.

he sounded so beautiful

in the low part of the song.

Rich baritone,
but then had that raspy quality.

too.

what else Ephraim's gonna do.
