00:07.074 --> 00:08.575
What the hell?

00:08.575 --> 00:10.677
Oh, it's a party for
<i>Sex Crimes Unit: Annapolis.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.412
We just wrapped
season 12.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.581
You're in four episodes.
You're hosting the wrap party?

00:14.581 --> 00:17.150
-Yeah.
-Don't you think maybe
you should've asked me?

00:17.150 --> 00:19.319
Why? The party's here.
I knew you'd be
here eventually.

00:19.319 --> 00:22.122
Nope, not invite me.
I mean, ask me,

00:22.122 --> 00:25.726
-like for permission,
since it's my place.
-Rog! Oh, it's Rog!

00:25.726 --> 00:30.230
Roger Trousdale.
I portray Admiral
Steve McClendon, retired.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.335
Your sister is like
a delicious tropical drink

00:35.335 --> 00:37.504
on a hot
Caribbean night.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.073
Who are you again?

00:41.174 --> 00:43.343
Hey. That dude's
been around forever.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.146
Started out in the soaps,
and he's still got it.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.382
-How do you figure?
-He's got a guy in Honduras

00:48.382 --> 00:52.753
that gets him erectile
dysfunction suppositories.
Maximum strength.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.655
Cheers to that.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.256
Nah.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.058
<i>♪ In the face, slam! ♪</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:00.994
-(chuckles) Right.
-What is in here?

01:02.095 --> 01:04.131
(water draining)

01:04.131 --> 01:07.067
-What did you say?
-Oh. Roxie.

01:07.067 --> 01:10.137
I'm on the phone.
Yeah, let's totally do that.

01:10.137 --> 01:12.306
Oh, you found
my retainer. Yay.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.707
-Yeah.
-I'll call you back.

01:15.108 --> 01:18.078
-I'm so, so sorry...
-I know.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.381
...but I need to feel
more respect from you
when I'm on the phone.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.050
-Me?
-Yeah.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.419
You are the disrespectful one--
the noise, the partying,

01:25.419 --> 01:28.555
the fact that you haven't
paid for a single thing
since you've been here.

01:28.555 --> 01:32.225
-Okay, that is
so not my fault.
-Roxie...

01:32.225 --> 01:34.227
Why have you not
deposited this check?

01:34.227 --> 01:36.730
I don't know.
The same reason
I haven't deposited these.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.300
No.
(sighs, chuckles)

01:40.300 --> 01:41.969
Okay, I need you
to pay rent,

01:41.969 --> 01:45.172
so you're gonna have
to take these to the bank
today and deposit them.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.741
Oh my god,
that sounds really hard.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.010
You know what?
This is my fault,

01:50.010 --> 01:52.212
for not making stricter rules
when you first moved in.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.182
Wait. Rules?
What, like to follow?
Okay, Mom.

01:55.182 --> 01:57.250
Rule #1: No parties.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.152
Fine. After-parties
are better, anyway.

01:59.152 --> 02:03.624
(sighs) Rule #2:
No people staying here
unless you know their names.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.093
What, like I can
control that?

02:08.495 --> 02:11.064
You have got
to get out of there.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.499
Why don't you stay
on my couch for a while

02:12.499 --> 02:15.469
before all that boring
decency and good sense
rubs off on you?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.971
Oh my god,
that would be awesome.
And Audrey wouldn't mind?

02:17.971 --> 02:21.375
I don't see how she can.
Her boyfriend always
spends the night here.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.310
I'm allowed
to have someone, too.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.012
Oh, thanks
for being so cool.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.447
Who knew your brother
was so uptight?

02:27.447 --> 02:29.549
You know, I don't even know
what I ever really saw in him,

02:29.549 --> 02:31.184
'cause I usually go
for a bad boy.

02:31.184 --> 02:34.321
Oh, you know who loves him?
And this is really gross.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.256
Parents and other
old people.

02:36.256 --> 02:37.658
-(scoffs)
-Oh, really?

02:39.426 --> 02:42.095
(cellphone ringing)

02:45.732 --> 02:48.702
-Aren't you gonna answer that?
-Oh, it's just Roxie.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.304
You don't want to talk
to your little sister?

02:51.304 --> 02:54.274
(laughs)
Well, of course
I'm gonna answer it.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.376
It's my sister.
We're very close.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.245
Hi, Mom.

02:58.245 --> 03:01.181
I won't be home by curfew
because I'm staying
at Patti's tonight.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.185
Wait. Patti's?
As in Audrey and Patti's?

03:05.185 --> 03:08.522
Hey, Kevie! I need you
to be my date at a family event.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.424
Roxie said parents love you
because you're completely

03:10.424 --> 03:12.726
non-threatening
and borderline asexual.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.395
Wow. No,
I'm not going with you.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.564
How's that
for borderline asexual?

03:17.564 --> 03:20.467
-(sighs) How do
you open the wine?
-I don't know.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.169
-(Patti yelps)
-Roxie: Oh, I got it.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.336
-Did that just spill
on my couch?
-Yeah.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.540
Don't worry about the couch.
It'll dry up long before we do.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.641
-(Patti and Roxie laugh)
-(beeps)

03:27.641 --> 03:29.109
(sighs)

03:30.210 --> 03:32.379
I have a list of rules

03:32.379 --> 03:35.982
that might be
a helpful jumping off point
if you're interested.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.251
-(sighs)
-Psst!

03:38.251 --> 03:40.420
I'm borderline asexual, too.

Hey, did you hand out some of my

04:10.117 --> 04:12.119
"Professional Training by Brian"
pamphlets at your work?

04:12.119 --> 04:13.587
You know I did, man.
Those look great.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.723
You spelled "professional"
wrong, but other than that--

04:16.723 --> 04:18.024
I hope they work.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.493
I need more clients
or I'm gonna have to start

04:19.493 --> 04:21.328
teaching balance classes
to 80-year-olds.

04:21.328 --> 04:24.598
I've seen one guy
fall over and take out the rest
of the class like dominoes, Kev.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.734
I picked this up,
and I'm interested,

04:27.734 --> 04:29.336
even though "training"
is spelled wrong.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.338
Oh my god, I can't believe
I didn't see that.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.474
Well, you'll never find
a better trainer...

04:34.474 --> 04:36.209
or a worse speller.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.013
Thanks, Kev. Okay.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.415
What are we looking
to do here?

04:42.415 --> 04:43.617
I have a high school
reunion coming up,

04:43.617 --> 04:44.985
and I'd like to get
back down

04:44.985 --> 04:46.386
to where I was
last time everyone saw me.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.754
What kind of time frame
are we looking at?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.389
-A month? Two months?
-Three years.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.391
I heard it was healthier
to lose weight slowly.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.593
That's true.
That's true.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.595
Here's a picture of me
in high school.

04:55.595 --> 04:59.666
Oh. So, you were never
what we would call a thin man.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.335
That's true. That's true.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.671
Well, look, I guarantee you
if you work with me,

05:04.671 --> 05:07.374
I'll have you looking
just as good as you did
in that picture in three years.

05:07.374 --> 05:10.143
Wow, a guarantee.
I like it.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.345
All right, let's do this.

05:12.345 --> 05:15.048
Bring it in.
Bring it in. Yeah.

05:15.048 --> 05:19.419
Wow. Ooh. You feel like
you've been hittin' it
pretty hard already.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.021
Yeah, you should know
before you train me

05:21.021 --> 05:23.023
that there's never a time
I'm not sweating,

05:23.023 --> 05:24.691
so it could be hard
to gauge my effort level.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.727
Okay. I can work with that.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.462
-Okay. Okay then.
-Let's get it again.

05:29.462 --> 05:32.232
Okay then.
Come on. Wow.
That is wet.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.700
(chattering)

05:36.436 --> 05:38.104
Maybe it's weird
that I'm noticing this,

05:38.104 --> 05:40.307
but what is that,
your ninth cup of coffee?

05:40.307 --> 05:43.476
It's fun at my place,
but I can't sustain
the partying.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.445
I feel like I'm living
in a frat house,

05:45.445 --> 05:48.048
-but with more guys.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.384
But you know, don't worry.
She's gonna get tired
of sleeping on your couch

05:51.384 --> 05:53.320
and soon enough she'll be
running back to my bed.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.356
I mean it's her bed now.
It's not our bed.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.191
That would be--
That's gross.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.327
I'm so jealous.
You're probably going
to watch TV

06:00.327 --> 06:02.462
and go to bed early
or something, right?

06:02.462 --> 06:06.433
Yes, although until right now,
that plan has never felt
like bragging.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.503
Buy hey, you know, if it...

06:10.503 --> 06:14.374
if it feels like it's too much,
you can always just...

06:14.374 --> 06:15.976
come to my place.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.678
Oh. That might be weird.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.448
-Would that be weird?
-No, no, not at all.

06:21.448 --> 06:25.185
Not to me.
No, it's just a quiet place
to watch some TV,

06:25.185 --> 06:28.288
eat some take-out,
wait for the Roxie storm
to blow over. Right?

06:28.288 --> 06:31.024
That is super sweet,
but luckily I think

06:31.024 --> 06:34.060
I already found a solution.
I'm moving in with Brock.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.298
I'm gonna go.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.437
I agreed to go to this stupid
white party thing with Patti

06:44.437 --> 06:46.072
so she'll kick Roxie
out of her place.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.174
She's gonna owe me a favor
after I charm her dad.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.076
Yeah, but if Roxie
stays with Patti,

06:50.076 --> 06:51.678
you get your apartment
back to yourself again, right?

06:51.678 --> 06:54.748
Yeah, but then Audrey lives
with Brock. That's worse.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.117
Get back
on the treadmill, Ricky.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.185
-Kevin: <i>You're still working?</i>
-Kinda.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.521
Ricky's gonna be
great for my before
and after portfolio.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.456
I got a lot of before shots,
but I'm not gonna get

07:03.456 --> 07:05.258
any after shots
unless I get through to him.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.060
I gotta go. Here's Patti.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.562
Okay, remember,
you're here as ear candy.

07:09.562 --> 07:13.733
So, charm the grown-ups
with your boring words about
401k's and architecture.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.703
-And keep it somber.
-Somber?

07:17.704 --> 07:19.406
You brought me
on a date to a funeral?

07:19.406 --> 07:22.108
Chill. It's just
some third cousin
who got hit by a train.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.177
Also, this isn't a date.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.346
It's a sting operation
to fool my dad into thinking

07:26.346 --> 07:29.349
I'm dating you
so I don't have to date
that disgusting doctor.

07:29.349 --> 07:33.253
Ugh, look at him,
Dr. Dev Banerjee.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.488
What a geek.
I was hoping he'd at least be

07:35.488 --> 07:38.391
one of those McWhatever
doctors, but obvi no.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.995
Gotta be a lot better looking
than that to take the stink off
of working with prostates.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.396
Okay, you know what?
I'm game for this,

07:43.396 --> 07:45.031
but you definitely
owe me a favor.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.034
I need you to kick Roxie out
and send her back to me.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.736
If you want her back,
why don't you just ask her?

07:49.736 --> 07:52.038
She's not answering
my calls or my texts.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.542
I've even tried commenting
on her Instagram, which meant
that I had to see her Instagram.

07:55.542 --> 07:59.512
-Yikes, even the one
where her left boob is like--
-Yeah, even that one.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.115
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm not kicking Roxie out.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.351
Audrey moved in with Brock,
and I'm not living alone.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.653
Pick another favor.
Okay, there's my dad.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.455
Be sure to put on your best,
"Well, hello, sir,

08:08.455 --> 08:11.524
"I just got a haircut,
I have a job and wear
brown shoes."

08:11.524 --> 08:13.226
You know what?
You're forcing my hand.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.561
Either you kick Roxie out

08:14.561 --> 08:17.564
or when I meet your dad,
I'm gonna pretend to be
completely nuts.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.267
-You wouldn't.
-You think I can't
play the part

08:21.267 --> 08:24.571
of a barely-functioning
alcoholic with an out-of-wedlock
kid in Indiana?

08:24.571 --> 08:26.606
Damn it, Connie!
He's my kid, too!

08:26.606 --> 08:29.009
-(angrily) What are you doing?
-Just getting into character.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.512
-Now what's your dad's
favorite slang for "vagina"?
-Okay, fine!

08:32.512 --> 08:34.581
I'm meeting Roxie
at a club later.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.149
I'll tell her she can't
stay with me anymore.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.417
Thank you.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.387
You're disgusting.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.560
Yesterday, that guy
signed a different name
than the one on his I.D.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.530
Totally hiding something,
or be cheating.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.399
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.601
I figured that we'd focus
on upper body today, all right?

08:54.601 --> 08:56.136
Well, I heard
he's a stay-at-home dad,

08:56.136 --> 08:58.038
but he's certainly not staying
at home when he's talking

08:58.038 --> 09:01.274
to that guy over there
who I know for a fact is gay.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.511
-Okay, sure.
-Rainbow bumper sticker,
waxed eyebrows,

09:04.511 --> 09:08.715
-Marc Jacobs gym bag.
-Wow. Okay, well, that's--
that's their business,

09:08.715 --> 09:11.584
and your workouts are
our business, so lie down.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.521
But-- Now? But we're
in the middle of a conversation.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.656
Yes, now. Come on,
enough of the chit chat.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.491
Let's go, Ricky.
Come on! Let's get it.
Come on, baby.

09:18.491 --> 09:23.530
Ah! Just so you know,
I don't respond well to
people barking out orders.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.665
I'm here to get in shape,
not invade Poland.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.635
-I'm your trainer, Ricky.
-You're killing my spirit.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.570
Wait! Rick!

09:39.279 --> 09:41.414
(shouting)
I've got some bad news!

09:41.414 --> 09:44.551
And I was waiting
for a loud, crowded
public place to tell you.

09:44.551 --> 09:48.688
Well, I've got some good news,
'cause the DJ is totally sizing
your stuff up.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.558
-Really?
-Dr. Dev is feeling low

09:51.558 --> 09:55.628
after a funeral,
so he's just prescribed
himself a shot...

09:55.628 --> 09:58.231
of vodka!

09:58.231 --> 10:00.433
-Oh my god.
-What?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.368
That's the guy
my dad was just
trying to set me up with.

10:02.368 --> 10:06.406
Dr. Dev is making
a house call tonight, y'all!

10:06.406 --> 10:09.008
Oh my god,
he's so into you!

10:09.008 --> 10:14.047
He's amazing! And your brother
and his brown shoes almost
killed my chances with him.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.715
Excuse me.
Give it up, sister.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.594
Deal's off, bub!
Not only is Roxie
gonna stay with me,

10:27.594 --> 10:30.396
but she's gonna help me
hook up with Dr. Dev.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.598
-What?
-The DJ.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.668
-Is that the guy
from the funeral?
-Thanks a lot, Kev,

10:35.668 --> 10:39.639
but Patti says
I can stay at her apartment
until I "seg" from BFF to BM.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.541
-BM?
-Bridesmaid!

10:54.387 --> 10:56.322
Audrey, hi.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.625
-What are you doing here?
-I'm so sorry.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.161
I know it's super late.
Can I come in?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.531
Yes, of cour--
Yeah, come on in.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.270
Oh! I didn't know
you had a dog.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.606
Oh. Yeah.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.976
Pepper is--
He's just outside,

11:16.976 --> 11:19.712
just chasing
that same squirrel.
There he goes.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.714
-Good boy!
-(dog barks)

11:23.583 --> 11:26.653
Yeah, I couldn't stand
another minute at Brock's.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.521
-(guys banging, shouting)
-(loud music playing)

11:34.394 --> 11:35.695
-Yes!
-Hey, babe.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.997
You remember Stump and Cheese,
my new training buds.

11:37.997 --> 11:42.035
Yup, you introduced me
to them when they were
here last night.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.576
Is there any way--

11:49.576 --> 11:51.477
and you can totally say no.

11:51.477 --> 11:54.147
Can I hang out here
for a little?

11:54.147 --> 11:57.417
I wouldn't ask, but since
you mentioned it before...

11:57.417 --> 12:00.987
and... I just need a break,

12:00.987 --> 12:02.488
and you live so close.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.625
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.596
-Yeah.
-Yes, come on in.
Have a-- Have a seat...

12:09.596 --> 12:11.698
-Okay.
-...on the sofa.

12:11.698 --> 12:15.168
-Sit. (chuckles)
-Oh, thank you.

12:15.168 --> 12:19.038
-(sighs)
-Let's see what movies are on.

12:20.974 --> 12:24.577
I don't know. Maybe moving in
with Brock was a huge mistake.

12:26.012 --> 12:26.613

12:29.082 --> 12:31.584

12:35.421 --> 12:38.124
-Oh!
-Oh.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.393
-For me?
-For me?

12:43.029 --> 12:44.998
-(chittering)
-Oh.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.670
-Do you take Audrey...
-(knocking on door)

12:54.707 --> 12:56.576
You know this
isn't real, right?

12:57.710 --> 12:59.979
Can we speed this up?
(clears throat)

13:07.020 --> 13:09.589
-(both laughing)
-Yeah, that part was hilarious.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.124
"You're outta
your element, Donny."

13:11.124 --> 13:13.393
Are you guys talking
about Donny?

13:14.460 --> 13:18.064
-There's no Donny
that works here.
-Oh. Right.

13:18.064 --> 13:21.467
Yeah, we've just been watching
a lot of movies together
the last couple of nights.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.170
I've been crashing
at Kevin's while I figure
some things out.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.507
Ooh, I was going to try
to make fresh pasta tonight.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.108
First attempt, so be kind.

13:29.108 --> 13:32.045
-Excellent.
I will be there.
-Yeah!

13:32.045 --> 13:34.347
Totally supportive
with a box of penne,
just in case.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.517
(laughs)
<i>Eat Pray Love</i> , right?

13:37.517 --> 13:40.720
I'm sorry.
I'm a little too desperate
to be part of this.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.056
I wouldn't be bothering you
if I had a trainer

13:43.056 --> 13:44.457
who communicated
with me more,

13:44.457 --> 13:47.427
but unfortunately he's obsessed
with making me lift stuff

13:47.427 --> 13:50.296
-and walk on things.
-Ricky, I think he's just
trying to get you in shape.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.665
Well, I need
a more holistic approach,

13:52.665 --> 13:54.133
so I think
I'm going to fire him.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.402
What? No, don't do that.
You've got to give him a chance!

13:56.402 --> 13:58.604
Kevin, I made up my mind.
I can't trust a trainer

13:58.604 --> 14:01.541
who's completely unaware
of the yoga teacher's
custody battle.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.044
My money was
on the father until he got fired
from the shoe store.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.750
-And this is
the radius, the ulna.
-(giggling)

14:10.750 --> 14:13.453
-Moving up
we find the humerus...
-Oh my god.

14:13.453 --> 14:17.090
...which you seem
to find quite humorous.
Different spellings by the way.

14:17.090 --> 14:21.327

and playful. <i>J'adore.</i>

14:21.327 --> 14:24.364

14:25.398 --> 14:28.434
I need to study

14:28.434 --> 14:30.603

a chance with Dev.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.528

14:57.296 --> 14:58.765
Ryan Gosling.

And I can't risk losing
two Ryans Gosling.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.403
You have to go back
to your brother's.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.238
No way. I'm not
going back there.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.240
Well, I'm sorry,

15:07.240 --> 15:10.309
but you've to find
somewhere else to rest

15:17.150 --> 15:20.253
Hey, man, I was just
on my way home.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.321
-Audrey's making pasta.
-My man.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.124
Yeah. But, I thought
you should know...

15:25.124 --> 15:26.726
Ricky's thinking
about firing you.

15:26.726 --> 15:30.196
What? But...
we've only had two sessions.

15:30.196 --> 15:33.032
He says you don't
communicate enough.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.268
-All he wants to do
is talk and gossip.
-I hear you. I hear you,

15:35.268 --> 15:38.204
but not everybody likes
to work out the way you do.

15:38.204 --> 15:40.339
I mean, you gotta
make it fun for Ricky,

15:40.339 --> 15:43.976
and if what he does
all day at the office
is any indication,

15:43.976 --> 15:46.379
talking about people
is a lot of fun for him.

15:46.379 --> 15:50.149
Are you sure?
I really feel like
he's on the verge.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.118
I just need to push him
a little harder and...

15:53.753 --> 15:55.655
-Yeah, maybe.
You're right. Okay.
-All right.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.089
Al right.
Well, hold on, man.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.358
Listen, your sister came in
and told me to give you this.

16:01.527 --> 16:05.031
-Roger Trousdale's address?
-She's said to send
her mail there.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.967
Wait. Roger Trousdale.

16:09.168 --> 16:10.303

she's living there, I guess.

the heads-up, Kev.
-Yeah!

16:33.226 --> 16:35.695
(clears throat)
Before we get started,

16:35.695 --> 16:36.996
I have something
I need to tell--

16:36.996 --> 16:38.364
Okay, let me tell you
something first.

16:39.365 --> 16:42.335
You know-- you know the girl
who washes the towels?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.070
-Yeah.
-You've seen her, right?

16:44.070 --> 16:46.672
I think she's sleeping
with the security guard.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.741
-I knew it!
-Oh, it's so interesting,
isn't it?

16:48.741 --> 16:51.210
-Mmm.
-Let's go sit on the big rubber
balls and talk about it, okay?

16:51.210 --> 16:52.645
-Yeah, yeah.
-I think she's pregnant.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.213
-(gasps)
-Yeah.

16:54.213 --> 16:58.117
-Jezebel.
-Just an open-legged woman.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.152
Hey, so I'm just out
running an errand.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.321
but hang tight,
and I will be there,

17:02.321 --> 17:05.124
and we will--
we will drink that wine
and watch that movie.

17:05.124 --> 17:08.094
Okay, no hurry.
You do what you need to do.

17:09.095 --> 17:13.032
I released
all the hounds but one.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.368

17:16.402 --> 17:18.371
Yeah, no, I definitely
need to do this.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.515
Okay. Wow.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.451
(clears throat)

17:38.558 --> 17:41.260
-Who are you?
-I'm Gerta Trousdale.
Who are you?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.563
-Where's Roxie?
-Oh, she's with Roger.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.464
And you're here too,
Mrs. Trousdale.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.567
What kind of a sick
freak show is this?

17:47.567 --> 17:52.038
-Roxie! Roxie!
-Relax, dear. They're in there.

17:52.038 --> 17:56.108
Oh, you poor dear.
He makes you stand out here
while he goes at it in there.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.144

18:06.285 --> 18:11.157
-I thought you were-- oh.
-Oh my, this is rich.

canoodling together.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.629
-(laughs)
-(scoffs) Kevin,
you're so gross.

18:16.629 --> 18:21.100
My dear boy, my man parts
have worked only sporadically
in the last 10 years.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.269
We've just been watching
my early years

18:23.269 --> 18:26.439
on the Canadian show,
<i>Provincial Homicide,</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:29.308
as the young prosecutor,
Gordon Thorson.

18:29.308 --> 18:33.212
-Is this your
boyfriend, sweetie?
-He's the brother, Gerta.

18:33.212 --> 18:37.583
(gasps)
Throwing your little sister
out on the street.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.686
Is that what she told you?
I just made a little list.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.555
Can I talk to you, please?

18:42.555 --> 18:46.125
(sighs deeply)

18:47.526 --> 18:51.597
-Why are you here?
-I wanna live somewhere
where I'm wanted, Kev.

18:51.597 --> 18:55.301
-Patti didn't want me,
you didn't want me.
-That's not true.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.269
Okay, it's a bit true.
I just...

18:58.270 --> 19:01.073
-I wanted some respect.
-You're my brother, Kevin.

19:01.073 --> 19:04.210
I already have parents.
I don't need some list of rules.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.246
You're right. I'm sorry.

19:08.247 --> 19:12.184
What about help?
Could you use some of that?

19:12.184 --> 19:14.987
At times,
maybe yes, I could.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.322
Do you wanna stay here?

19:17.390 --> 19:20.059
(sighs) Not really.
I mean, they're really nice,

19:20.059 --> 19:22.294
but... it's not home.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.097
And there's no Wi-Fi, so...

19:26.132 --> 19:27.333
Are you asking me back?

19:30.136 --> 19:32.338
(whimsical music playing)

19:34.340 --> 19:35.441
Thanks!

19:35.441 --> 19:37.176
(chirping)

19:52.058 --> 19:53.592
Yeah, I'm asking you back.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.396
-Ow.
-(laughs)

19:57.396 --> 19:59.098
Ow. Ow.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.034
(mumbles)
I'm such an idiot.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.237
Aw. They were really nice.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.207
You know, they have
blankets that you wear.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.277
I just can't imagine
you living with some
old married couple.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.379
Oh, they're not married.
Gerta's his sister.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.283
Oh, wouldn't it be sweet
if we ended up that way?

20:17.283 --> 20:20.553
I'm kidding.
I have no intention
of living past 50. Ugh.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.535
<i>(Audrey speaking)</i>

20:41.240 --> 20:43.342
(sighs)
You ready?

20:43.342 --> 20:44.744
Yeah.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.980
(rock music playing)

20:47.980 --> 20:51.117
It's super easy,
and it combines
something that you love--

20:51.117 --> 20:53.285
taking pictures--
with something that I love--

20:53.285 --> 20:54.620
you having money
in your bank account

20:54.620 --> 20:55.688
to pay rent with.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.323
You can do it all
on your cellphone

20:57.323 --> 20:59.125
and you never have to be awake
during bank hours.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.127
Wow. Cellphones are for more

21:01.127 --> 21:02.194
than just posting selfies.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.262
Who knew?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.263
(chuckles)

21:04.263 --> 21:06.265
Thanks for helping me.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.600
I'm really happy I'm here.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.339
No, no, no.

21:13.339 --> 21:15.241
Just the check.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.079
No.
