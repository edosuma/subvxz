02:32.417 --> 02:33.517
Yargh!

02:33.551 --> 02:34.851
Agh!

02:35.520 --> 02:37.621
Wait, wait! Jimmy, please!
God, please!

02:37.655 --> 02:39.456
Please, Jimmy,
you don't need to do this!

02:39.490 --> 02:41.258
Tell me everything
the cops know.

02:42.226 --> 02:44.995
They pulled me out from
undercover four months ago.

02:45.029 --> 02:47.030
Tell me what they know.

02:47.064 --> 02:50.434
I'm... I'm not targeting you
any more.

02:50.468 --> 02:52.469
I was building a case.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.504
The dummy meds.

02:54.539 --> 02:57.407
The deal didn't go through,
they don't have anything.

02:57.442 --> 02:59.376
You don't have to lie to me
anymore.

02:59.410 --> 03:03.280
If they had anything, they'd have
moved against you by now. I'm not.

03:03.314 --> 03:05.315
Please, Jimmy,
I'm not targeting you.

03:05.349 --> 03:07.217
I'm not after you, I swear it.

03:07.251 --> 03:08.952
What the fuck
are you doing here?

03:11.422 --> 03:13.089
My son.

03:13.124 --> 03:14.324
What?

03:14.892 --> 03:17.227
My son was killed
four months ago.

03:17.261 --> 03:19.262
He was seven years old.

03:19.297 --> 03:22.532
That's why they pulled me off
the case, that's why I disappeared.

03:23.734 --> 03:25.702
What does this have to do
with me?

03:26.036 --> 03:28.071
He was killed in a drive-by.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.441
And the bullet that hit him
was home-made.

03:31.475 --> 03:33.510
The same kind that killed Tony.

03:37.782 --> 03:41.417
The same kind they pulled out of my
shoulder, the one that was meant for you.

03:42.987 --> 03:45.555
Clay Street aren't moving
against you, Jimmy.

03:45.589 --> 03:48.691
They're burying their grandfather,
they're in fucking mourning.

03:48.726 --> 03:50.894
They're not moving
against anybody.

03:51.829 --> 03:53.797
Somebody's setting you up.

03:53.831 --> 03:55.732
Listen to me, listen to me.

03:55.766 --> 03:59.369
How do you know it's not somebody close
to you, somebody from your own crew?

03:59.403 --> 04:00.937
Fuck you!

04:00.971 --> 04:03.072
Whoever it is,
they murdered my son!

04:04.275 --> 04:06.242
And they tried to kill you.

04:06.277 --> 04:09.712
Please! Please! Let me help you.
Let me help you.

04:09.747 --> 04:11.714
Why should I ever trust you?
Why?

04:11.749 --> 04:13.750
We want the same people.

04:13.784 --> 04:16.786
We want the same people, I'm not after you.
I can help you.

04:16.821 --> 04:20.322
No, you stood there and you let
me kill Grindenko, didn't you?

04:20.925 --> 04:22.892
What was I supposed to do?

04:22.927 --> 04:24.727
It was him or me.

04:24.762 --> 04:26.496
Now it's you.

04:28.599 --> 04:30.767
- Look at me.
- No, no, no. You don't need to do this.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.802
- Look at me!
- You can't do this!

04:32.837 --> 04:34.871
- You can't!
- Look at me!

04:49.353 --> 04:51.354
You are dead now.

04:52.256 --> 04:54.591
I know who you are,
I know where you live.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.659
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

04:57.161 --> 04:59.529
But you are dead.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.901
Jesus Christ, Grace!

05:39.570 --> 05:41.938
- What happened?
- Don't! Don't look at me!

05:41.972 --> 05:43.840
Fuck, Grace!

05:43.874 --> 05:45.208
Get out!

05:53.384 --> 05:55.251
Tell me.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.720
Tell me.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.361
Oh, Tom...

06:14.905 --> 06:16.606
I'm so sorry.

06:18.809 --> 06:20.643
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

06:20.678 --> 06:21.844
It's okay.

08:44.721 --> 08:46.089
What's going on?

08:47.057 --> 08:49.025
Everything good, chief?

08:49.059 --> 08:51.094
We need to clean house.

08:51.962 --> 08:54.730
New phones, new routines.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.034
Yeah, I got it.

09:00.904 --> 09:02.672
What are you doing here?

09:04.308 --> 09:06.976
If I don't go home by 10:30,
I don't get to go home at all.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.011
Is that your rule or Nancy's?

09:09.046 --> 09:11.747
That's a rule that has
advantages to both parties.

09:22.359 --> 09:23.793
Drink?

09:42.646 --> 09:44.614
Evie needs a change.

09:44.648 --> 09:46.682
She won't admit it,
of course, but...

09:48.085 --> 09:50.086
Maybe that's what we all need...

09:51.088 --> 09:53.089
..a clean start
somewhere new.

09:55.225 --> 09:59.095
I'm not talking about
running or forgetting.

09:59.129 --> 10:01.130
I'm just...

10:01.165 --> 10:03.733
We need to give ourselves
a chance, you know?

10:09.506 --> 10:11.507
We can do this, Grace.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.211
We can do this.

10:18.148 --> 10:19.782
To Tony.

10:19.816 --> 10:21.484
Tony.

10:33.430 --> 10:36.933
I remember the first time you
brought him down here to the docks.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.769
He had that suit that was about
eight sizes too big.

10:39.803 --> 10:41.904
I said, "That kid looks like
an accountant."

10:41.939 --> 10:45.208
You said, "He is an accountant
and he's gonna make us rich."

10:45.242 --> 10:47.276
And he did.

10:48.679 --> 10:50.246
Yeah, he did.

10:52.883 --> 10:54.884
It ain't fucking right.

10:56.019 --> 10:58.187
Tony was not part of this,
he was never violent.

10:59.256 --> 11:01.224
It ain't fucking right.

11:01.258 --> 11:02.391
Hm.

11:48.839 --> 11:50.139
Christ, Travis!

11:50.173 --> 11:52.174
What the fuck
are you doing here?

11:52.209 --> 11:54.210
Your phone's off.

11:54.244 --> 11:56.646
- I'm on compassionate leave.
- Bullshit! Compassionate leave...

11:56.680 --> 11:59.048
Wilson's been looking
for you all night.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.318
Home with my family.
What do you expect?

12:02.352 --> 12:04.387
Frankly, I expected you
to be dead.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.991
You're compromised.

12:10.594 --> 12:12.161
How? How do you know that?

12:12.996 --> 12:14.664
There's chatter.

12:16.366 --> 12:17.466
Chatter?

12:17.501 --> 12:19.168
Who from, Laszlo's crew?

12:19.202 --> 12:22.638
I gave you a direct goddamn
order and you ignored it.

12:22.673 --> 12:24.373
Now stay the fuck
out of Oakland.

12:24.408 --> 12:26.142
I need to know who made me
and how.

12:26.176 --> 12:29.979
Your captain in San Jose will hear
about your conduct in the morning.

12:30.013 --> 12:31.881
Get yourself a good union
lawyer.

12:31.915 --> 12:33.049
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you,

12:33.083 --> 12:35.418
for making me drive all night,
thinking you were dead.

12:39.022 --> 12:40.990
So, um... on your travels...

12:41.024 --> 12:42.792
did you get anything
from Jimmy?

12:42.826 --> 12:44.260
Like what?

12:44.294 --> 12:47.229
You know, like anything on the Tony Aldon
murder might be useful to me.

12:47.264 --> 12:48.764
No.

12:52.736 --> 12:54.537
Well, at least she's not dead.

12:54.571 --> 12:56.339
What the fuck were you thinking?

12:56.373 --> 12:57.406
Me?

12:57.441 --> 12:59.508
Running her without
authorization.

12:59.543 --> 13:01.143
Come on.
She was running herself.

13:01.178 --> 13:03.579
One more fuck-up from you
and I go after your badge.

13:03.613 --> 13:04.680
Understand?

13:05.949 --> 13:07.950
Yes, Lieutenant, I understand.

13:09.286 --> 13:11.287
How are the boys holding up?

13:13.390 --> 13:14.924
The boys are fine.

13:22.332 --> 13:24.033
What about you?

13:44.921 --> 13:46.922
Everybody's got your back,
Jimmy.

13:48.525 --> 13:51.894
We're gonna get through this.
We've gotten through worse.

13:55.832 --> 13:56.866
Hm.

14:02.072 --> 14:04.073
Everything's gonna be fine.

14:17.087 --> 14:18.921
You're going back, aren't you?

14:24.828 --> 14:27.696
You never had any intention
of giving this a chance.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.101
That's not true.

14:32.135 --> 14:33.302
Don't.

14:35.338 --> 14:38.374
Don't. Just stop giving me
any fucking hope, okay?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.448
"Here we are in the Bay area.

14:45.482 --> 14:48.117
Hope you're having a great time.
Talk to me..."

15:06.403 --> 15:08.204
Let me get two El Pastor.

15:08.238 --> 15:10.239
I'm not open yet. I'm sorry.

15:10.273 --> 15:11.807
Hey!

15:11.842 --> 15:13.476
- Face down, homie!
- Okay. Okay, okay.

15:13.510 --> 15:15.778
- I said, face down!
- Please, please...

15:15.812 --> 15:18.180
I said stay the fuck on the ground.

15:18.215 --> 15:21.517
Take the money, don't take
the truck. I have no insurance, please!

15:27.257 --> 15:28.624
No, please.

15:28.658 --> 15:30.693
No, no. Please, please!

15:34.764 --> 15:37.332
I'm gonna go and put you
on the wireless system.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.368
This is what we use
in Vallejo PD.

15:39.402 --> 15:41.537
Can you make sure we get
the whole street?

15:41.571 --> 15:43.439
So I can see which cars
are parked.

15:43.473 --> 15:44.707
Hey, where are you going?

15:45.842 --> 15:47.309
To school.

15:47.343 --> 15:49.378
- Yeah, I'm gonna drive you.
- I'm taking the bus.

15:49.412 --> 15:51.046
No, I will drive you.

15:51.081 --> 15:52.347
Why?

15:52.382 --> 15:55.017
Do I need a reason?
Can't I just wanna drive you?

15:56.820 --> 15:58.787
What do you have upstairs?

15:58.822 --> 16:00.956
Master bedroom
and two kids', right?

16:00.990 --> 16:02.691
Yeah. Two.

16:02.726 --> 16:05.060
Is it okay if I go through back,
see what you need?

16:05.095 --> 16:06.795
Sure.

16:06.830 --> 16:10.065
- I'm gonna be late.
- He's almost done. Now, listen.

16:09.866 --> 16:12.935
From now on, if you need
a ride, you call me.

16:12.969 --> 16:14.937
You got it?

16:14.971 --> 16:16.205
Got it.

16:16.239 --> 16:18.240
And I will pick you up,
or Dad will.

16:18.274 --> 16:20.309
Which means Dad will.

16:23.179 --> 16:26.081
So I noticed Dad didn't sleep
on the couch last night.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.150
Yeah. You noticed that,
did you?

16:29.519 --> 16:31.787
Does this mean
you're staying home now?

16:33.123 --> 16:35.290
I want you to come straight home
after school.

16:35.792 --> 16:38.293
Why? What's the big deal?

16:39.062 --> 16:40.562
Nothing.

16:41.931 --> 16:43.899
I thought I would cook,

16:43.933 --> 16:45.534
make Ziggy's lasagna.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.403
Fine.

16:48.438 --> 16:49.705
Yeah?

16:49.739 --> 16:51.140
Yeah.

16:53.576 --> 16:54.977
Good.

16:59.249 --> 17:00.649
Travis.

17:01.885 --> 17:03.352
Yes, sir.

17:03.386 --> 17:05.420
I'll be there.

17:06.955 --> 17:09.724
I have to go back to the shop,
pick up a couple more sensors.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.794
Good. Can we go now?

17:28.153 --> 17:31.554
_

17:34.858 --> 17:37.249
_

17:39.371 --> 17:42.958
_

17:47.103 --> 17:51.203
_

17:54.789 --> 18:00.375
_

18:41.217 --> 18:43.218
What's wrong?

18:44.520 --> 18:46.255
Nothing, it's just work shit.

18:47.123 --> 18:48.690
Your boss lady again?

18:49.726 --> 18:53.061
Why is it that women in power are
always bigger assholes than men?

18:53.897 --> 18:55.330
I have lady boss.

18:55.365 --> 18:57.466
Then you know
what I'm talking about.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.867
No.

19:00.203 --> 19:03.238
Man boss much worse.
Trust me.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.842
I guess it depends on
your line of business.

19:17.020 --> 19:18.921
Hey, hold on.

19:18.955 --> 19:21.123
We've still got business
to discuss.

19:25.628 --> 19:26.828
So...

19:28.431 --> 19:31.033
who's running the grow houses
in Tuxedo these days?

19:31.067 --> 19:33.068
Depends what street.

19:33.102 --> 19:34.536
28th Street.

19:34.570 --> 19:38.140
It's a little green bungalow with
black plastic on the windows.

19:38.741 --> 19:43.078
Everything above 20th Street
belong to Lee brothers.

19:44.047 --> 19:46.048
Clay Street.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.626
_

19:59.062 --> 20:01.063
_

20:03.833 --> 20:05.834
Your money's over there.

20:10.606 --> 20:13.575
All right, listen up!
We're gonna be tightening ship.

20:13.609 --> 20:16.945
Which means we swap out
cellphones.

20:18.014 --> 20:19.982
So let me have the old ones.

20:20.016 --> 20:21.450
Right here.

20:22.618 --> 20:23.819
Come on, come on.

20:27.557 --> 20:31.660
Now, Jimmy,
in his infinite generosity,

20:32.395 --> 20:35.998
will be providing each of you a
fresh cellphone every two weeks.

20:37.233 --> 20:39.468
Yeah, and who's paying
for the minutes?

20:41.004 --> 20:42.437
Pay as you go.

20:42.472 --> 20:44.506
Just like your sister.

21:08.431 --> 21:09.698
Ruby?

21:14.937 --> 21:16.938
There you go. Two hands.

21:17.673 --> 21:19.941
- Thank you, Daddy.
- You're welcome, baby.

21:19.976 --> 21:22.144
Uncle Max is coming home today.
Are you excited?

21:22.178 --> 21:24.212
Yeah?

21:24.881 --> 21:26.548
Good girl.

21:26.582 --> 21:28.283
Go play.

21:29.385 --> 21:30.786
What time
are we picking him up?

21:30.820 --> 21:32.354
Dad's getting him.

21:32.388 --> 21:34.423
You're not going?

21:35.391 --> 21:37.492
He wants to do it himself.

21:37.527 --> 21:40.262
We should all be there to
welcome Max, especially you.

21:40.296 --> 21:41.596
I know.

21:41.631 --> 21:43.698
Doesn't he have enough
on his plate right now?

21:43.733 --> 21:45.734
It's the way he wants it.

21:45.768 --> 21:48.537
You don't have to worry
about every little detail.

22:02.585 --> 22:04.586
Thank God he has you.

22:06.923 --> 22:09.858
Let's face it, delegating has
never been his strong suit.

22:11.327 --> 22:13.028
He delegates.

22:15.364 --> 22:17.899
Has he delegated our little
Chinese problem?

22:21.804 --> 22:23.338
That'll be taken care of.

22:23.873 --> 22:25.841
They almost killed your father.

22:25.875 --> 22:28.677
The days are going by
and nobody is doing anything about it.

22:28.711 --> 22:30.345
- Come on!
- I'm serious.

22:30.379 --> 22:33.548
It's getting to the point where I'm nervous
taking our daughter out in public.

22:33.583 --> 22:36.551
I don't want you to be nervous.
I am taking care of it.

22:46.028 --> 22:47.996
It pisses me off.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.331
What?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.668
He has no idea how lucky
he is to have you.

22:55.805 --> 22:57.305
He knows.

23:08.818 --> 23:10.919
Are you sure
this is the right account?

23:10.953 --> 23:12.554
Quite sure.

23:12.588 --> 23:14.289
Why, is there a problem?

23:14.323 --> 23:17.392
The system is showing a balance
of zero dollars in this account.

23:17.426 --> 23:19.761
That's impossible.
My accountant told me

23:19.795 --> 23:24.499
Aldon transferred a significant amount
of money into this account two days ago.

23:24.867 --> 23:27.135
Perhaps you could discuss this
with your accountant.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.804
My accountant is not available.
Check it again.

23:30.406 --> 23:32.007
The system is showing--

23:32.041 --> 23:35.610
"System is showing"? What the fuck does that
supposed to mean? "The system is showing"?

23:35.645 --> 23:37.746
Mr. Laszlo, I have to ask you
to keep your voice down.

23:37.780 --> 23:41.216
And I'll have to ask you
to locate my fucking money!

23:41.250 --> 23:44.186
There was never any money
in this account, Mr. Laszlo.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.254
There's nothing
for me to locate.

24:08.644 --> 24:10.345
Good luck out there, Max.

24:10.379 --> 24:12.047
Thank you.

24:28.731 --> 24:30.532
Jesus, Jimmy!

24:31.901 --> 24:34.836
- What's the matter?
- Where's my money?

24:34.870 --> 24:36.037
Money? What money?

24:36.072 --> 24:37.639
The 25 million
your husband stole from me.

24:37.673 --> 24:39.207
I've got no idea what you're
talking about.

24:39.242 --> 24:42.043
Bullshit! Where you packing off
to in such a hurry?

24:42.078 --> 24:44.746
I am moving back to Stockton
to be with my mother.

24:44.780 --> 24:47.949
Fuck your mother! Nobody goes
anywhere until I get my money.

24:47.984 --> 24:49.884
There is no money, Jimmy,
there never was.

24:49.919 --> 24:52.387
Take a look around. This place has
been falling apart for years.

24:52.421 --> 24:54.956
Who was Tony meeting
before he died, who was he talking to?

24:54.991 --> 24:56.625
Nobody. Tony never talked to anybody.

24:56.659 --> 24:59.894
- He didn't do this alone.
- I think you should leave.

24:59.929 --> 25:01.930
I was good to you,
I was good to Tony.

25:01.964 --> 25:03.999
All I asked for
was a bit of loyalty.

25:04.033 --> 25:06.801
He was loyal.
That was his problem.

25:06.836 --> 25:10.405
Poor stupid Tony was always on your
side, despite what anybody said.

25:13.476 --> 25:14.776
Look at you.

25:14.810 --> 25:18.346
Tony was your friend and here
you are terrorizing his widow.

25:18.381 --> 25:20.415
You've inherited his debt,
Lizzie.

25:51.981 --> 25:53.381
What?

25:53.416 --> 25:55.483
You with Max yet?
Put him on.

25:55.518 --> 25:57.786
Max? Oh, fuck. Thanks.

26:51.507 --> 26:53.174
You said that would go smoothly.

26:53.209 --> 26:55.610
You said you weren't
going to say anything.

26:55.644 --> 26:57.645
No, no. I did not say that. You did.

26:57.680 --> 27:02.283
It's a temporary suspension, with pay, pending
an IAD investigation. This is standard.

27:02.318 --> 27:03.818
Listen...

27:03.853 --> 27:07.756
in light of what happened to your son
and the nature of the misconduct,

27:07.790 --> 27:10.358
they're going to take your
mental state into account.

27:11.827 --> 27:13.328
My mental state?

27:13.362 --> 27:15.463
They're likely to order
a psychiatric evaluation.

27:15.498 --> 27:17.499
Well, I won't agree to that.

27:17.533 --> 27:19.534
Don't give them any more ammo.

27:19.568 --> 27:22.637
Okay, just lay low
and don't stonewall.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.974
Go home, Grace.

27:26.008 --> 27:27.842
Be with your family.

27:46.295 --> 27:47.962
You okay?

27:47.997 --> 27:50.031
I'm fine.

27:53.035 --> 27:55.036
You look good. Hm?

27:56.639 --> 27:58.640
There's no shade in the yard.

27:59.308 --> 28:01.543
You either stay inside
or rot in the sun.

28:01.577 --> 28:03.611
At least they let you exercise.

28:05.781 --> 28:07.315
I read a lot.

28:07.349 --> 28:09.851
I read all the classics,
some of them twice.

28:09.885 --> 28:11.386
Anything good?

28:12.755 --> 28:15.323
After a while,
they all start to blur together.

28:15.357 --> 28:17.258
Fucking 12 months, huh?

28:17.293 --> 28:21.496
For resisting arrest when they had no
cause to arrest you in the first place.

28:21.530 --> 28:25.199
That fucking judge should be
disrobed and disbarred.

28:25.234 --> 28:27.268
Legalized criminals.

28:29.371 --> 28:31.372
I don't blame the judge.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.943
Anyway, I'm trying not
to hold grudges.

28:34.977 --> 28:36.978
Well, you're a better man
than me.

28:39.815 --> 28:41.816
We already knew that.

29:16.618 --> 29:18.586
Alec couldn't come to meet me?

29:18.620 --> 29:20.655
No, I wanted to pick you up
myself.

29:24.460 --> 29:25.793
Listen, Max...

29:27.162 --> 29:29.163
you're gonna get back on track.

29:29.665 --> 29:31.632
Yeah, I know. I know.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.000
Thanks.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.841
How's business?

29:41.009 --> 29:43.010
Business is okay.

29:44.179 --> 29:46.481
It's gonna be much better
now that you're back.

29:46.515 --> 29:48.516
Yeah, it's good to be home.

29:48.550 --> 29:49.917
Yes.

29:52.654 --> 29:55.757
Listen. I need to drop you at the house.
There's something I have to do.

29:55.791 --> 29:57.425
Just drop me off here.
I can walk.

29:57.459 --> 29:58.893
Are you sure?

29:58.927 --> 30:01.696
I haven't taken a walk
in 12 months. I don't mind.

30:02.564 --> 30:03.965
All right.

30:05.067 --> 30:06.901
I'll see you back at the house.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.771
- For six o'clock.
- Sure.

30:11.507 --> 30:13.274
It's good to see you, Dad.

30:13.308 --> 30:15.176
It's good to see you too, Max.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.044
Good to see you.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.467
Hey.

30:39.501 --> 30:41.803
- How you doing?
- Hey, man! How you doing?

30:41.837 --> 30:43.871
Good to see you.
How you been?

30:53.649 --> 30:55.049
How'd you get in here?

30:55.083 --> 30:58.486
You must be the only cop in America
who can't break into a car.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.159
I got burned.

31:06.161 --> 31:08.162
Jimmy knew my real name.

31:09.064 --> 31:11.065
How come you're still alive?

31:11.934 --> 31:13.334
I dunno.

31:14.203 --> 31:16.204
But somebody in Oakland
burned me.

31:17.072 --> 31:19.073
And we need to smoke 'em out.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.209
We?

31:21.243 --> 31:23.711
Yeah, I need your password
for the database.

31:23.745 --> 31:25.880
IAD suspended me.

31:25.914 --> 31:27.348
Whoa, whoa.

31:27.382 --> 31:30.651
Someone in Oakland
sold me out. All right?

31:30.686 --> 31:33.287
Now they're trying to take
my badge. Think about it.

31:33.322 --> 31:34.689
Why now?

31:34.723 --> 31:37.692
Probably because you're making
somebody very nervous. Me included.

31:37.726 --> 31:39.827
Come on, Mitch, don't be an asshole.
Give me your password.

31:39.862 --> 31:41.562
I'd like to help.

31:41.597 --> 31:43.231
Then help.

31:43.265 --> 31:45.266
If they find out,

31:45.300 --> 31:47.535
they're gonna come
after my badge too.

31:48.270 --> 31:50.271
I got too much to lose here.

31:51.206 --> 31:53.207
You wanna talk about loss?

32:00.349 --> 32:02.016
Maybe they're right.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.051
You should just
take a little time,

32:04.086 --> 32:06.120
go be with your family.

32:27.042 --> 32:29.043
Guess what, motherfuckers?

32:30.212 --> 32:31.345
What?

32:32.180 --> 32:33.681
I'm retiring.

32:33.715 --> 32:36.217
Retiring from what?

32:37.052 --> 32:41.055
I'm gonna fulfill my childhood dream
of owning my very own taco truck.

32:44.026 --> 32:45.860
You two know
where I could find one?

32:46.962 --> 32:49.964
Um... check the classifieds?

32:49.998 --> 32:51.098
Yeah.

32:52.601 --> 32:54.201
That's funny.

32:54.236 --> 32:56.237
I did check the classifieds.

32:56.271 --> 32:59.206
Only what caught my attention
was a certain headline

32:59.241 --> 33:02.143
about two fucking idiots
who robbed a father of three

33:02.177 --> 33:04.545
and fled the scene
in his diarrhea wagon.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.681
What'd you do with the truck?

33:06.715 --> 33:09.550
I pushed it in the reservoir.
It's gone, it's fine.

33:10.819 --> 33:14.288
Jesus. That's your own mother's
drinking water, you know that?

33:16.291 --> 33:18.292
I'm sorry, man.

33:24.433 --> 33:26.434
I got a job coming up.

34:10.411 --> 34:11.512
Jacks.

34:12.714 --> 34:14.415
Back up!

34:15.516 --> 34:17.784
You always bring your piece
to the supermarket?

34:17.819 --> 34:19.652
I mean it. Back up!

34:19.688 --> 34:21.688
This the real you, is it?

34:27.195 --> 34:31.665
You know everything about me. It's only
fair I know a little something about you.

34:32.534 --> 34:34.502
What the fuck do you want?

34:34.536 --> 34:36.536
Be here this evening.

34:36.571 --> 34:38.371
At six.

34:42.043 --> 34:44.045
Leave the piece at home.

34:46.648 --> 34:48.649
Bring a bottle.

35:58.971 --> 36:01.633
_

36:17.405 --> 36:19.240
Detective Mitchell?

36:20.175 --> 36:21.775
Lieutenant.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.544
It's been a long time.

36:23.578 --> 36:26.614
So how's life in... Where is it
you landed, Santa Cruz?

36:27.215 --> 36:29.183
San Jose.

36:29.217 --> 36:31.285
It's wonderful.
Thanks for asking.

36:31.319 --> 36:34.288
Too bad you opted for early retirement.
Oakland misses you.

36:35.257 --> 36:37.591
I wish I could say
the feeling was mutual.

36:39.194 --> 36:41.162
So what can I do for you,
Lieutenant?

36:41.196 --> 36:44.598
I see you just ran a NCIC search
on Jimmy Laszlo.

36:46.468 --> 36:48.536
You have him flagged?

36:48.570 --> 36:52.773
Why would a fucking cold-case desk jockey
in San Jose be interested in Laszlo?

36:54.309 --> 36:56.277
Just a shot in the dark.

36:56.311 --> 36:58.045
Enlighten me.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.414
Uh...

37:00.448 --> 37:02.449
Ballistics
pulled a possible link

37:02.484 --> 37:06.387
between a cold file of mine
and an associate of Laszlo's.

37:09.958 --> 37:13.127
The recently departed Tony
Aldon, Oakland, California.

37:13.161 --> 37:15.196
So what's the link?

37:18.133 --> 37:20.367
Both hit with the same
home-made bullet.

37:20.402 --> 37:21.936
Turned out to be nothing.

37:21.970 --> 37:23.671
Doesn't sound like
nothing to me.

37:25.040 --> 37:28.609
I'm just dotting the I's before I
move onto the next, Lieutenant.

37:28.643 --> 37:30.211
From now on,

37:30.245 --> 37:33.647
anything you have down in San
Jose with a link to Jimmy Laszlo,

37:33.682 --> 37:36.450
I need it folded
into my operation,

37:36.484 --> 37:39.019
whether you perceive it
to be nothing or not.

37:39.054 --> 37:41.088
Sure thing.

37:57.839 --> 37:59.139
Steve.

37:59.174 --> 38:00.808
Good to see you.

38:00.842 --> 38:03.477
- Where the hell is Max?
- Relax, he'll be here.

38:04.246 --> 38:07.314
You know he does it on purpose
just to be the center of attention.

38:08.149 --> 38:10.117
Oh, shit, we're out of ice.

38:10.151 --> 38:13.053
Will you get some more?
I'll check on the barbecue.

38:16.558 --> 38:18.559
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby girl.

38:19.194 --> 38:21.161
Where's Grandpa?

38:21.763 --> 38:23.764
- Hiya.
- Beautiful.

38:24.799 --> 38:26.767
- Where's Max?
- He'll be here.

38:26.801 --> 38:30.204
You know, sometimes, I swear he does this
to be the center of attention.

38:30.238 --> 38:32.840
It's his party, hm?
Don't give him a hard time.

38:32.874 --> 38:34.842
Don't worry.

38:34.876 --> 38:36.543
I won't.

38:36.578 --> 38:38.579
It's like he never
even existed.

38:38.613 --> 38:40.347
- Who?
- Tony.

38:40.382 --> 38:42.383
What are you going on
about now?

38:42.417 --> 38:44.718
Those fucking slopes offed him
not two days ago,

38:44.753 --> 38:47.855
yet we're eating fucking rock
shrimp like it never happened.

38:47.889 --> 38:51.091
You heard Jimmy. We're gonna hit
back when the time is right.

38:51.126 --> 38:54.161
Yeah. I'm starting to have serious
doubts that time will come.

38:54.195 --> 38:55.963
What are you talking about?

38:56.798 --> 38:58.766
Have another drink,
it's a party.

38:58.800 --> 39:03.003
It's a party? When they put a bullet in
your head, I'll remember to say that.

39:03.038 --> 39:05.072
...two, three!

39:07.842 --> 39:10.344
How come you always end up
at the kids' table?

39:10.378 --> 39:13.147
Because we're having
a tea party.

39:14.282 --> 39:16.483
Well, perhaps we've had enough
tea for today.

39:16.518 --> 39:20.254
Hey, gang, this is
my beautiful wife Nancy.

39:21.156 --> 39:22.856
The love of my life.

39:22.891 --> 39:24.892
Okay, wait, I got a new game.

39:24.926 --> 39:27.828
Listen, three, two, one...

39:28.430 --> 39:30.130
Ohh!

39:30.165 --> 39:32.166
Nancy, no!

39:32.200 --> 39:34.234
Corrupting the children,
Charlie?

39:48.783 --> 39:50.084
Dude.

39:51.886 --> 39:52.886
Dude.

39:52.921 --> 39:54.555
Good to see you, baby face.

39:54.589 --> 39:56.590
It's good to see you.

39:56.624 --> 39:58.659
You too.

40:01.629 --> 40:03.130
What's that for?

40:03.164 --> 40:05.199
I missed a birthday or two.

40:06.134 --> 40:07.401
Thanks.

40:13.141 --> 40:16.076
So, are you coming down or are you
gonna hide in your room?

40:17.946 --> 40:19.380
I just need a minute.

40:19.414 --> 40:21.448
Take your time.

40:24.753 --> 40:26.754
The room feels so big.

40:31.259 --> 40:33.227
How's Dad been?

40:33.261 --> 40:34.762
Good.

40:34.796 --> 40:36.830
Considering what's going on.

40:39.067 --> 40:40.601
He's happy you're back.

40:45.607 --> 40:47.641
What's the turnout like
down there?

40:47.675 --> 40:49.676
The usual posse.

40:49.711 --> 40:51.945
Don't worry,
I'll fend everybody off.

40:53.314 --> 40:55.315
Just try not to shiv
the relatives.

40:58.853 --> 40:59.887
Okay.

41:00.455 --> 41:02.055
Let's do this.

41:02.090 --> 41:04.224
Lieutenant,
I got something for you.

41:04.259 --> 41:05.426
Progress?

41:05.460 --> 41:08.962
Like a shark, I drown if
I'm not always moving forward.

41:08.997 --> 41:10.397
What have you got?

41:10.432 --> 41:13.434
That license plate from the
drive-by on Jimmy Laszlo

41:13.468 --> 41:15.602
was registered to a grow house
in Tuxedo.

41:15.637 --> 41:17.404
I thought that house
was a non-starter.

41:17.439 --> 41:20.574
Well, it turns out it's a Clay Street
operation, the Lee brothers.

41:21.342 --> 41:24.545
The hoisin sauce at the Tony
Aldon murder-- it kinda fits.

41:24.946 --> 41:27.514
The Lee brothers are making
a play for the docks.

41:27.549 --> 41:29.783
Well, you know. They take out Tony Aldon,
they aim a shot at Jimmy Laszlo.

41:29.818 --> 41:33.821
According to my CI, the boys are playing war
out the back of the family restaurant--

41:33.855 --> 41:36.824
The Bamboo Pearl on Frank--

41:36.858 --> 41:38.292
Who's the CI?

41:39.294 --> 41:41.662
237. Prefers to remain
anonymous.

41:43.164 --> 41:45.165
Start writing the warrant.

41:47.168 --> 41:48.168
Maxie!

41:49.504 --> 41:51.305
Maxie!

41:54.809 --> 41:55.943
Maxie!

42:05.320 --> 42:06.954
- Over here.
- Thanks.

42:08.022 --> 42:09.423
Now...

42:13.862 --> 42:15.462
Welcome back, Max.

42:30.311 --> 42:31.678
Hey, everybody.

42:31.713 --> 42:33.580
Excuse me. Excuse me!

42:33.615 --> 42:36.316
Oakland Police. I have a warrant
to search the premises.

42:36.351 --> 42:37.985
You can't just charge in here.

42:38.019 --> 42:39.653
- I can do whatever I want.
- Hey, hey, hey! - Hey, back off!

42:39.687 --> 42:41.288
Don and Tony Lee,
where are they?

42:41.322 --> 42:43.323
Oakland Police.
We have a warrant.

42:43.358 --> 42:45.959
Mrs. Lee, my condolences.
Here's your warrant.

42:45.994 --> 42:48.028
Paul and Donny Lee,
are you home?

42:50.164 --> 42:54.201
Attention, please, this is Oakland Police.
Nobody is to leave the premises.

42:54.235 --> 42:56.470
Officers will take
your information.

43:11.653 --> 43:13.654
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.561
Mom still at the store?

43:28.136 --> 43:30.103
She's not coming, is she?

43:30.138 --> 43:31.672
Evie, sweetheart. Come here.

43:31.706 --> 43:33.740
- Don't.
- Hey.

43:33.741 --> 43:34.741
Don't.

44:15.883 --> 44:17.851
You must be Jackie.

44:17.885 --> 44:19.920
And you must be Max.

44:22.557 --> 44:24.324
I've heard a lot about you.

44:25.660 --> 44:27.327
Only good things, I hope?

44:28.496 --> 44:31.298
Well, they certainly
didn't tell me everything.

44:32.934 --> 44:34.167
Watch out.

44:34.202 --> 44:37.504
I'll tell your father you're
flirting with his employees.

44:38.506 --> 44:41.208
Who is he gonna believe,
me or you?

44:44.579 --> 44:47.314
I heard you got picked up
a few months ago.

44:47.348 --> 44:48.982
Uh-huh.

44:49.017 --> 44:51.051
And now you're back.

44:53.788 --> 44:55.789
I hear you went away too.

44:56.524 --> 44:58.025
Uh-huh.

45:00.595 --> 45:02.129
Welcome home.

45:28.890 --> 45:30.724
Thank you.

45:53.481 --> 45:55.449
- Jackie.
- Nancy.

45:55.483 --> 45:57.517
Charlie's wife.

45:58.086 --> 45:59.853
You look beautiful.

45:59.887 --> 46:01.321
Oh, please.

46:01.355 --> 46:03.824
- No, really.
- Well, thank you.

46:03.858 --> 46:06.259
What is she doing here?
She doesn't even know Max.

46:08.429 --> 46:10.964
But she's getting awfully cozy
awfully fast.

46:16.971 --> 46:18.438
I don't recognize you.

46:18.473 --> 46:20.474
I'm a work associate
of Jimmy's.

46:20.508 --> 46:23.310
But I've never been to
a private function before.

46:23.344 --> 46:26.546
I guess I'm moving up
in his estimations, right?

46:27.815 --> 46:29.382
He's a good man.

46:30.852 --> 46:32.018
Welcome.

46:32.053 --> 46:33.820
Thank you.

46:33.855 --> 46:35.889
- Need a refill?
- No, no, I'm good.

46:37.325 --> 46:40.260
- Where's the lady's room?
- Just down the hall.

46:53.875 --> 46:55.609
Oh, sorry.

46:55.643 --> 46:57.410
- Get in here.
- It's okay.

46:57.445 --> 46:58.912
Jackie.

46:59.714 --> 47:01.515
Get in here, now.

47:01.549 --> 47:03.583
Close the door.

47:06.287 --> 47:07.988
You're just in time.

47:26.574 --> 47:27.874
How was that?

47:29.811 --> 47:31.812
Just what I needed.

47:43.658 --> 47:45.325
You having fun, hm?

47:45.359 --> 47:47.360
What the fuck am I doing here?

47:47.395 --> 47:49.396
I invited you.

47:49.430 --> 47:51.431
What's going on there?

47:51.465 --> 47:53.466
It's Jackie Hays.

47:54.001 --> 47:55.969
Not too shabby, huh?

47:56.003 --> 47:58.004
You trust her?

47:58.039 --> 47:59.806
Dad seems to.

47:59.841 --> 48:01.842
She's bringing in
good business.

48:01.876 --> 48:03.910
I'm glad you've come.

48:05.613 --> 48:07.247
I didn't have a choice.

48:07.281 --> 48:09.449
She's obviously got
a thing for Pops.

48:10.651 --> 48:13.320
Good. He deserves it.

48:15.523 --> 48:17.924
Meet me out back
in two minutes.

48:17.959 --> 48:19.693
Why?

48:20.361 --> 48:22.362
Two minutes.

48:24.365 --> 48:26.499
Chop suey? Give me a break.

48:26.534 --> 48:28.668
Chop suey's as American
as apple pie.

48:28.703 --> 48:31.004
You go to Hong Kong
and try and order chop suey.

48:31.038 --> 48:32.906
Might as well ask
for a cheeseburger.

48:36.544 --> 48:37.744
Shit!

48:41.515 --> 48:43.016
Stop, police!

48:47.021 --> 48:49.222
Everybody, get out. Shit!

48:49.257 --> 48:50.357
Wilson!

48:50.391 --> 48:51.825
Everybody, out the building!

48:54.095 --> 48:55.395
Fuck, fuck!

48:56.430 --> 48:58.265
- Fleming!
- Come on!

48:59.166 --> 49:00.467
Help!

49:00.501 --> 49:02.035
Back here!

49:05.072 --> 49:07.040
Finally, some peace and quiet.

49:07.074 --> 49:09.109
Why did you want me here, Jimmy?

49:19.854 --> 49:22.322
You wanna find your son's
killer, don't you?

49:26.694 --> 49:28.128
You were right.

49:30.231 --> 49:32.565
Don't worry.
You'll be okay.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.434
About what?

49:35.069 --> 49:36.903
I have a traitor in there.

49:45.413 --> 49:46.947
Who?

49:48.683 --> 49:50.684
I don't know.

49:51.218 --> 49:53.219
But you're gonna help me
find them.
