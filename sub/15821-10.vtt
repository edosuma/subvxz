WEBVTT

00:00.752 --> 00:02.267
Raise your right hand.

00:03.235 --> 00:05.592
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

00:05.593 --> 00:08.442
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you god?

00:08.443 --> 00:09.754
I do.

00:11.208 --> 00:13.220
Would you please state
your name for the record?

00:13.221 --> 00:14.626
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

00:14.627 --> 00:17.266
And, uh, what is your job title?

00:17.267 --> 00:20.806
Deputy chief priority homicide,
Los Angeles police department.

00:21.085 --> 00:25.425
We are assembled in the offices of
Kornbluth, Elkins and Brenner et Al

00:25.428 --> 00:30.330
for depositions in the
separation agreement Pope V Pope.

00:30.332 --> 00:32.953
Docket number 3025a.

00:32.969 --> 00:34.620
Counsel for both parties are present.

00:34.627 --> 00:37.853
Also present is the
respondent William H. Pope.

00:37.879 --> 00:40.073
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

00:40.805 --> 00:46.393
The matter before us today is the
legal custody of Mr. Pope's children.

00:46.398 --> 00:48.902
Now chief Johnson, you have been
called as a character witness,

00:48.916 --> 00:51.611
so would you please,
in your own words,

00:51.617 --> 00:55.340
describe Mr. Pope as
a man and as a father.

00:55.865 --> 00:58.780
Will is a devoted
and loving father.

00:58.786 --> 01:01.683
As assistant chief, he
oversees thousands of officers.

01:01.686 --> 01:05.741
He handles this responsibility
with integrity, honesty and decency.

01:05.748 --> 01:08.422
And that's the example
he sets for his kids.

01:09.135 --> 01:10.530
Ms. Johnson,

01:10.535 --> 01:14.010
how would you describe your
relationship with Mr. Pope?

01:14.245 --> 01:15.731
He's my boss.

01:15.746 --> 01:18.331
And isn't he also
a sexual partner?

01:19.416 --> 01:20.430
Excuse me?

01:20.446 --> 01:24.333
For the record, this
is exhibit number 3.

01:24.335 --> 01:28.032
A letter written by
Ms. Johnson to Mr. Pope

01:28.036 --> 01:31.660
discovered by my client among
her husband's belongings.

01:31.665 --> 01:34.391
Is this your handwriting,
Ms. Johnson?

01:35.425 --> 01:37.912
That letter was
written a long time ago.

01:37.916 --> 01:40.141
Before chief Pope
ever met Estelle.

01:40.148 --> 01:42.123
Was Mr. Pope married to
someone else at the time?

01:42.125 --> 01:44.733
- This is my personal correspondence.
- Will, Will, please--

01:44.738 --> 01:45.983
I object.

01:45.987 --> 01:48.391
This line of questioning
is way beyond the subpoena

01:48.398 --> 01:50.502
and borders on harassment.

01:50.505 --> 01:51.941
On the contrary.

01:51.948 --> 01:54.810
Ms. Johnson's previous
relationship with the respondent

01:54.817 --> 01:57.491
brings into question the issues
of character and integrity

01:57.495 --> 01:59.982
which she herself has raised.

02:00.017 --> 02:03.270
Frankly, I wonder how
the thousands of officers

02:03.275 --> 02:05.270
who report to assistant chief Pope

02:05.276 --> 02:07.822
would feel about his
honor and integrity

02:07.828 --> 02:11.861
if they knew he'd promoted
his mistress to be his deputy.

02:21.768 --> 02:24.553
I'm sorry.
There's been a murder.

02:24.597 --> 02:26.622
I have a crime scene to get to.

02:26.758 --> 02:29.092
Ms. Johnson, I haven't
finished asking my questions.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.762
But I've finished answering them.

02:30.768 --> 02:32.430
Thank you so much.

02:45.525 --> 02:46.701
Chief Johnson.

02:46.705 --> 02:48.460
I thought you had
a deposition today.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.700
It's over.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.720
Thank you for covering. You
want to bring me up to speed?

02:51.725 --> 02:52.652
Certainly.

02:52.656 --> 02:55.280
First officers on the scene
broke the window, opened the door,

02:55.288 --> 02:58.233
stepped inside found our
victim, female, late twenties,

02:58.235 --> 02:59.912
on the sofa, shot in the head.

02:59.918 --> 03:03.602
Oh, the house is listed
under the name Rawley.

03:03.606 --> 03:05.953
- Is that a name I should know?
- Samuel Rawley.

03:05.958 --> 03:08.801
He was a big shot in the garment
center downtown for 30 years.

03:08.808 --> 03:10.172
Young lady's his daughter.

03:10.178 --> 03:12.691
Mailman there called in the 911.

03:12.695 --> 03:14.960
Chief, this is Derek Draper.

03:14.966 --> 03:16.353
- Mr. Draper.
- Hi.

03:16.365 --> 03:18.653
Can you tell me who gets
the mail at this house?

03:18.658 --> 03:21.291
Gennifer Rawley. It's
Gennifer with a "G."

03:21.298 --> 03:22.590
Anyone else?

03:22.596 --> 03:23.991
Not that I know of.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.861
Could you tell me why
you called the police?

03:25.867 --> 03:28.481
Well, I was bringing a
package to the front door,

03:28.496 --> 03:31.573
and I could see Ms. Rawley through
the window, you know, on the sofa,

03:31.577 --> 03:34.051
and I rang the bell,
and she didn't move.

03:34.066 --> 03:36.180
And I banged on the glass, and...

03:37.165 --> 03:40.130
she still didn't move,
so I called the police.

03:40.135 --> 03:41.723
You did the right thing.

03:43.076 --> 03:46.581
Oh, thank you, Mr. Draper. Thank you.

03:47.246 --> 03:50.133
Ok, let's take a look
at Gennifer with a "G."

03:50.136 --> 03:51.141
Chief.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.922
Oh, thank you.

03:53.535 --> 03:55.151
Chief. Chief.

03:55.156 --> 03:57.042
- Booties.
- Oh, right.

03:57.117 --> 03:58.423
Of course.

04:03.946 --> 04:06.601
What's that smell? That's not
decomposition. What is that?

04:06.605 --> 04:08.352
Decomp mixed with crystal meth.

04:08.356 --> 04:10.821
Odorless in the bag.
Stinks when you smoke it.

04:10.828 --> 04:12.763
And when you sweat it out.

04:12.837 --> 04:15.612
Man, meth addicts
really prefer the dark.

04:15.615 --> 04:17.480
They're like vampires.

04:18.005 --> 04:19.933
Thank you for keeping everything as is.

04:19.938 --> 04:21.851
You can turn the lights on now.

04:25.005 --> 04:26.450
Time of death?

04:26.455 --> 04:28.390
They're saying between 4 and 6am.

04:28.397 --> 04:30.432
She got a bullet to
the back of the head.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.053
Ugly.

04:32.267 --> 04:33.972
And they left that behind.

04:33.977 --> 04:36.490
It's usually hit men that
drop their weapon at the scene.

04:36.498 --> 04:39.611
But commander, you said the
responding officers had to break in

04:39.618 --> 04:41.421
suggesting there was no forced entry.

04:41.427 --> 04:42.483
Yes, ma'am.

04:42.485 --> 04:44.890
But a drug addict
isn't always so choosy

04:44.897 --> 04:46.560
about who she lets into the house.

04:46.568 --> 04:48.920
One of her junkie friends
could've killed her for some cash,

04:48.928 --> 04:50.900
or for no reason at all.

04:50.908 --> 04:54.193
Looks like she went on a bit of
a shopping spree before she died.

04:54.268 --> 04:56.942
Wouldn't a junkie have hauled
off some of this electronic stuff?

04:56.945 --> 04:58.492
It's easy to sell.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.201
Or maybe she killed herself.

05:01.728 --> 05:03.970
Chief! Oh, chief.

05:03.975 --> 05:06.760
Got something out here in the
guest house you ought to look at.

05:06.767 --> 05:09.150
Chief, I want
to show you something.

05:13.058 --> 05:16.411
Now, if something
was stashed in here,

05:16.648 --> 05:18.620
like cash maybe,

05:18.646 --> 05:19.972
it's gone.

05:19.978 --> 05:21.503
Thank you.

05:25.805 --> 05:27.001
Oh...

05:29.105 --> 05:31.523
Oh, looks like someone's
either living out of a suitcase,

05:31.526 --> 05:33.310
or just got back from vacation.

05:33.317 --> 05:37.113
Lieutenant Tao, let's put an investigative
hold on Gennifer's credit cards,

05:37.118 --> 05:38.723
but keep them active.

05:38.728 --> 05:42.071
I'd like to take a look at
her financial history please.

05:42.195 --> 05:44.501
Lieutenant Flynn, with a
drug habit like this one,

05:44.508 --> 05:47.170
I'll bet Gennifer with a
"G" has an arrest record.

05:47.176 --> 05:49.293
I'd like to review it please.

05:50.608 --> 05:54.341
Lieutenant Provenza, let's put a rush
on those prints for a positive I.D.

05:54.345 --> 05:57.402
and sergeant Gabriel, next of kin.
We've got a notification to do.

05:57.406 --> 05:58.511
Thank you.

05:58.517 --> 06:01.362
Chief Johnson, this looks
like a drug rip-off gone bad.

06:01.376 --> 06:02.630
If you have some other commitments,

06:02.636 --> 06:05.460
I'll have Robbery/Homicide
take up the slack.

06:05.688 --> 06:07.952
I appreciate your attention
to my schedule, commander,

06:07.955 --> 06:11.333
but right now, there's no place
else chief Pope would rather I be.

06:15.905 --> 06:18.122
You kept my letters?

06:18.127 --> 06:20.860
Estelle had no business going
through my personal stuff.

06:20.868 --> 06:24.943
I've worked so hard to earn the
trust of my division. My god!

06:24.947 --> 06:27.400
Why is Estelle
doing this to me?

06:27.898 --> 06:29.980
You told me she didn't
even want the kids.

06:29.988 --> 06:33.123
I think she's just using them
to blackmail me for more money.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.703
Blackmail you?

06:35.456 --> 06:37.432
What about me, Will?

06:37.435 --> 06:40.920
If my testimony leaks out,
the entire LAPD is gonna think

06:40.936 --> 06:43.460
that you hired me
because we had an affair.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.263
Look, I can't--

06:45.329 --> 06:48.300
I can't do this deposition for
you. I'm sorry. I just, I can't.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.963
Look, I haven't been in
L.A. that long myself.

06:50.969 --> 06:54.450
You're the only person here who
really knows me besides the chief.

06:54.457 --> 06:58.743
I promise I would not ask you to do
this under any other circumstances.

06:58.747 --> 07:01.823
But Brenda, this is my kids.

07:05.315 --> 07:06.710
Ok.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.893
Thank you.

07:10.385 --> 07:12.811
But I'm getting the most
expensive lawyer in the city,

07:12.815 --> 07:14.171
and you're paying for it.

07:14.175 --> 07:15.551
Done.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.732
Oh, I'm selling those
cookies for my son's school.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.053
It's a charity thing.

07:21.118 --> 07:23.583
You're not asking me to
pay for these cookies.

07:23.585 --> 07:24.990
Are you?

07:25.275 --> 07:26.483
No.

07:33.026 --> 07:34.872
So what makes you think
there's something wrong?

07:34.875 --> 07:35.841
Well, you saw it.

07:35.847 --> 07:38.381
Taylor tried to stick his nose
in, and she just walked away.

07:38.386 --> 07:40.130
She didn't kick his ass.

07:40.136 --> 07:41.492
Lieutenant Flynn.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.742
How are we doing on Gennifer
Rawley's arrest record?

07:43.746 --> 07:47.671
Uh, she's got busts going
back at least three years.

07:47.677 --> 07:49.522
All for possession.

07:50.226 --> 07:52.441
Mostly crystal meth.

07:52.447 --> 07:56.143
Chief, want me to hold
some of those boxes for you?

07:56.146 --> 07:57.181
No, thank you.

07:57.187 --> 07:59.921
Lieutenant Tao, were you able to
track down Gennifer's finances?

07:59.927 --> 08:03.901
She has a family trust that
pays her $25,000 a month.

08:03.907 --> 08:05.690
The house was paid for outright.

08:05.698 --> 08:08.541
So she has a way of
funding her drug habit.

08:08.546 --> 08:11.302
I got to the family, too. They're
driving up from Newport Beach.

08:11.308 --> 08:13.621
Detective Sanchez, what do the
neighbors say about Gennifer?

08:13.635 --> 08:16.063
She was kind of a freak.
She didn't have any friends.

08:16.067 --> 08:17.771
Any time anyone
came near the house,

08:17.777 --> 08:20.253
she started screaming
and waving her gun around.

08:20.256 --> 08:22.813
Which ended up being the
same gun she was killed with.

08:22.826 --> 08:25.723
Registered in her name.
No prints.

08:25.728 --> 08:27.063
So, somebody wiped the gun.

08:27.066 --> 08:28.882
There goes our suicide option.

08:28.887 --> 08:30.251
Well, maybe it was
like Taylor said.

08:30.256 --> 08:33.383
Some wacko tweeker shot her
with her gun and took off.

08:33.385 --> 08:35.491
Or theory number two.

08:35.495 --> 08:39.111
Somebody knew that she was stashing
a bunch of cash in her mattress,

08:39.116 --> 08:41.260
ripped her off and killed her.

08:41.758 --> 08:44.283
Guys, we got a hit on
Gennifer's credit cards.

08:44.297 --> 08:46.782
Someone at a drugstore
in the Hollywood Hills

08:46.788 --> 08:49.763
is trying to buy $300
worth of sleeping pills.

08:49.768 --> 08:52.342
Have security keep them there.
Send all available units.

08:52.348 --> 08:53.962
Lights and sirens, everyone.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.413
Lights and sirens.

09:02.935 --> 09:04.901
Get away! Don't!

09:04.908 --> 09:07.612
Everybody make nice for our
wannabe anchor man over here.

09:07.618 --> 09:09.010
Leave me alone. Who are you?

09:09.017 --> 09:10.631
- Easy, easy.
- Who are you? Get back!

09:10.638 --> 09:12.063
Easy, easy.

09:12.066 --> 09:13.093
Hey, hey!

09:13.096 --> 09:14.452
- Relax, easy, easy.
- They're trying to kill me.

09:14.456 --> 09:15.731
Who are you? Get back!

09:15.735 --> 09:17.392
She's high as a kite, you guys.

09:17.396 --> 09:19.770
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- Get these guys away from me!

09:19.778 --> 09:24.721
All right, just take one giant
step back. Come on. One step.

09:24.737 --> 09:27.230
- Easy, easy.
- Miss, look, we don't want to hurt you.

09:27.237 --> 09:29.152
- I didn't do anything.
- We just want you to come quietly.

09:29.155 --> 09:31.741
I didn't do it. I mean it. Stay away!

09:32.945 --> 09:35.150
- She spit on him.
- Quietly, ok?

09:36.328 --> 09:38.040
Go! Get her!

09:40.076 --> 09:41.382
Get her!

09:45.127 --> 09:46.880
Let me up!

09:46.885 --> 09:49.483
- Leave me alone!
- Shut up.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.193
Help me!

09:51.267 --> 09:53.542
Police brutality!

09:54.027 --> 09:55.971
Are you getting all of this?

09:56.367 --> 09:59.413
No spitting. No spitting.
You shut your mouth!

09:59.427 --> 10:00.753
Listen to me.

10:00.756 --> 10:04.662
You're under arrest for the
murder of Gennifer Rawley.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.350
I am Gennifer Rawley.

10:09.635 --> 10:11.170
Aren't I?

10:18.607 --> 10:20.743
I gotta go. It's not
safe here. I kid you not.

10:20.748 --> 10:22.350
Why not? Who's trying to hurt you?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.763
They know who they are.
Look, I got nothing to say.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.502
What time is it? May I go now?

10:27.717 --> 10:31.332
If they know I'm here, if I
say anything, I'm good as dead.

10:31.337 --> 10:32.831
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

10:32.848 --> 10:34.562
She's chatty.

10:35.045 --> 10:37.480
You're looking
at the real Gennifer Rawley.

10:37.487 --> 10:40.432
She's been in drug rehab in
Palm Springs up until yesterday

10:40.435 --> 10:43.521
when she checked herself
out one week early.

10:43.706 --> 10:45.523
I guess she was cured.

10:46.065 --> 10:48.242
Chief, fingerprint
analysis came up with a hit

10:48.258 --> 10:49.980
on the dead girl
at the Rawley Home.

10:49.985 --> 10:53.610
Her name is Marianne Elzey and like
Gennifer, she has a history of drug busts.

10:53.618 --> 10:56.531
Ok, thank you, lieutenant.
Would you track down next of kin.

10:56.538 --> 10:58.631
I've got a notification to make.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.382
Well, since Gennifer isn't dead,

11:01.388 --> 11:03.941
what's say we treat
her like a suspect.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.290
Alrighty.

11:05.807 --> 11:07.951
- Help me. Help me.
- Gennifer--

11:08.026 --> 11:10.792
Gennifer, Gennifer, you
are perfectly safe here.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.820
- I'm deputy chief--
- I've got nothing to say.

11:12.827 --> 11:14.860
Nothing to say.
I won't say anything.

11:14.865 --> 11:16.340
That'd be a change.

11:16.355 --> 11:18.543
Believe it or not, she's
starting to wind down a little.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.133
Ms. Rawley,
you left rehab last night.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.412
What time did you get home?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.300
I didn't go home.
I can't go home.

11:24.305 --> 11:26.830
Are you crazy? They're trying
to kill me. I kid you not.

11:26.836 --> 11:30.312
Gennifer, do you know a woman
by the name of Marianne Elzey?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.522
- Is she a friend of yours?
- I don't have friends.

11:32.527 --> 11:34.392
Who's that? What did she say?

11:34.398 --> 11:36.401
Who told you about Marianne?
What did she say? She's lying.

11:36.408 --> 11:39.741
Marianne was found dead
in your house last night.

11:39.747 --> 11:43.521
Oh! I knew it.
They're trying to kill me.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.390
That's why I got out.

11:45.426 --> 11:47.943
They put a tracer on my credit
cards so that you'd bring me here.

11:47.945 --> 11:48.820
I kid you not.

11:48.826 --> 11:51.353
Look, I gotta go.
It's not safe here.

11:51.358 --> 11:54.563
Why was she in my house?
Who let her in?

11:57.007 --> 11:59.260
God, they were looking for me.

11:59.965 --> 12:01.980
Wait, wait.
Who's trying to kill you?

12:01.985 --> 12:03.720
The bikers and the mexicans.
Blake and Batista.

12:03.726 --> 12:05.333
You said Marianne.
Is she, did she?

12:05.338 --> 12:07.953
I think maybe I should tell-- the tattooed
guy was always looking at me funny.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.792
No! Rios and Pike.
Talk to Rios and Pike.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.212
Ok, slow down.

12:12.217 --> 12:15.563
Rios and Pike she seems to think
are some kind of narcotics officers.

12:15.565 --> 12:16.750
Do they even exist?

12:16.757 --> 12:19.780
I am not putting my
head in that metal thing.

12:19.797 --> 12:22.142
All we're prepared to tell you
right now is that she's connected

12:22.148 --> 12:26.450
to a major meth trafficking ring we've
been investigating for the past 2 years.

12:26.455 --> 12:31.061
And how many people have you
arrested in this 2 year investigation?

12:33.668 --> 12:36.072
You told me I'd have
100 percent cooperation.

12:36.077 --> 12:37.432
Hold on, chief. Hold on.

12:37.447 --> 12:39.501
We're just having a little
trouble communicating.

12:39.505 --> 12:40.760
That's because
they're not talking.

12:40.765 --> 12:41.950
Rios.

12:41.968 --> 12:43.691
Answer her questions.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.313
What do you have going
on with Gennifer Rawley?

12:47.318 --> 12:49.231
We busted her a number of times.

12:49.238 --> 12:51.360
I know that already.
I've seen her record.

12:51.366 --> 12:54.410
I also noticed that Gennifer's
not served one day of jail time

12:54.417 --> 12:57.760
despite her being a repeat
offender, and I wonder why.

12:57.776 --> 13:01.531
We've been sort of using Gennifer as
a C.I. for the last year and a half.

13:01.538 --> 13:02.830
We flipped her.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.121
You flipped her?

13:04.128 --> 13:06.050
Where? On her head?

13:06.056 --> 13:08.882
You really expect me to believe
that you've been using Gennifer

13:08.887 --> 13:10.291
as a confidential informant?

13:10.295 --> 13:12.600
She's been in drug rehab
for the past 2 months.

13:12.608 --> 13:14.170
Have you been calling her there?

13:14.208 --> 13:15.741
And remember, I can look that up.

13:15.747 --> 13:17.173
All right, look.

13:20.238 --> 13:22.440
We think we may be able to trace
some of the stuff she's been buying

13:22.447 --> 13:24.620
to this... this biker gang.

13:24.627 --> 13:26.793
She mentioned something about
bikers, I think, didn't she?

13:26.795 --> 13:28.441
She's convinced they're
trying to kill her.

13:28.445 --> 13:29.363
Are they?

13:29.366 --> 13:31.811
They knew she was ratting
them out to us, maybe, yeah.

13:31.815 --> 13:33.250
Do you have a name?

13:33.258 --> 13:36.291
It's complicated. We
wouldn't know where to start.

13:36.296 --> 13:38.810
Maybe we can keep everyone happy here

13:38.816 --> 13:42.163
without jeopardizing a 2-year
narcotics investigation.

13:42.168 --> 13:43.283
Chief.

13:43.285 --> 13:45.152
Gennifer's family is here.

13:45.155 --> 13:47.883
Thank you, detective. Would
you have them wait in my office.

13:48.365 --> 13:50.983
Well, I can't promise
to make everybody happy.

13:50.987 --> 13:52.370
But I can make this easier.

13:52.376 --> 13:55.222
Detectives Rios and Pike, you will
hand over Gennifer's C.I. packet

13:55.227 --> 13:57.170
to sergeant Gabriel.
Immediately.

13:57.177 --> 13:58.832
Ma'am, we've been working
on this case for 2 years.

13:58.836 --> 13:59.790
You can't ask
us to just--

13:59.797 --> 14:02.862
I'm not asking you, I'm ordering
you to hand over that C.I. packet.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.700
And you are dismissed.

14:04.728 --> 14:06.461
Thank you, commander.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.102
Excuse me.

14:14.506 --> 14:15.950
Mrs. Rawley.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.222
I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

14:18.236 --> 14:19.813
Thank you so much for coming down.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.481
This is my son Sammy.

14:21.488 --> 14:23.201
And my husband Sam.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.713
Nice to meet you, sir.

14:24.716 --> 14:26.611
So how does this work?

14:27.388 --> 14:30.220
Which one of us has
to identify the body?

14:30.226 --> 14:31.600
Excuse me?

14:31.608 --> 14:35.131
The police called and told
my son that Genny was dead.

14:36.118 --> 14:38.231
I'm so sorry. That...

14:38.236 --> 14:41.753
that never should've happened.
And it's not true.

14:42.206 --> 14:44.951
There was some confusion
about Gennifer's identity,

14:44.956 --> 14:46.700
but she is not dead.

14:47.215 --> 14:48.700
She's...

14:48.785 --> 14:50.320
she's here.

14:53.465 --> 14:58.470
Though there was someone who was
murdered at her house last night.

14:58.478 --> 14:59.893
Maybe a friend of hers.

14:59.896 --> 15:02.261
Did y'all know a Marianne Elzey?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.362
Genny's friends scare us.

15:05.485 --> 15:07.760
Do you know anyone who
might want her killed?

15:07.768 --> 15:08.751
No.

15:08.755 --> 15:11.182
Is Genny responsible for all of this?

15:11.195 --> 15:15.041
Were you aware that Gennifer was
in a drug rehab clinic recently?

15:15.045 --> 15:16.112
Oh, yes.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.763
In Palm Springs.

15:18.177 --> 15:19.832
For almost two months.

15:19.976 --> 15:22.372
Sammy put her there
after my husband came home

15:22.378 --> 15:25.852
to find Genny trying to rip
the TV off our living room wall.

15:25.866 --> 15:27.402
Mom, please.

15:27.407 --> 15:31.062
Her father didn't even recognize her,
Genny was so messed up.

15:31.428 --> 15:33.670
Sam tried to chase
her out of the house.

15:33.678 --> 15:36.292
Genny nearly scratched
his eyes out.

15:36.415 --> 15:41.493
The police called and told
my son that Genny was dead.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.542
They made a mistake, dad.

15:43.546 --> 15:45.241
Can we take my sister
home now, please?

15:45.246 --> 15:46.633
I told you, Sammy.

15:46.637 --> 15:47.980
We bought her a house.

15:47.985 --> 15:49.722
We're not taking her back in ours.

15:49.725 --> 15:52.470
I can't release Gennifer
right now anyway.

15:53.865 --> 15:57.222
Did any of you know that
Gennifer had left the rehab?

15:57.226 --> 16:00.441
Yes, but leaving rehab doesn't
mean she's a murderer, does it?

16:00.446 --> 16:02.642
She needs a lawyer, mom.

16:02.645 --> 16:04.210
That is not our problem.

16:04.215 --> 16:06.361
Genny's a grown woman.

16:06.366 --> 16:10.033
If she wants to throw her life away,
it's out of our hands.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.821
Is there anything else?

16:11.826 --> 16:14.802
Do you know how Gennifer
got back from Palm Springs?

16:14.806 --> 16:18.571
Against my wishes, my son
drove out and picked her up.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.822
You should have kept her there.

16:22.827 --> 16:25.170
The clinic discharged her, mom.
What did you want me to do?

16:25.175 --> 16:26.450
Leave her
in the middle of the desert?

16:26.456 --> 16:28.853
You know very well what I wanted.

16:31.035 --> 16:34.363
Come on, Sam. We're going.

16:37.085 --> 16:38.961
Liz, where's Genny?

16:40.917 --> 16:45.050
It turned out
that the police were right.

16:45.378 --> 16:47.143
Genny's dead, darling.

16:47.146 --> 16:48.602
She's dead.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.010
Um...

16:50.105 --> 16:51.960
let's go home, now, darling.

16:52.786 --> 16:54.252
Come on.

16:56.748 --> 16:58.103
Sammy.

17:06.945 --> 17:12.093
We had such good reports about
Genny from the rehab before she...

17:13.507 --> 17:17.262
When you picked her up, did you
take her straight to her house?

17:17.276 --> 17:19.761
No. I, uh...

17:20.315 --> 17:22.910
I took her to Newport
Beach to show my parents

17:22.916 --> 17:24.691
how good she was doing,

17:24.746 --> 17:27.403
but mom wouldn't allow
her inside the house.

17:27.406 --> 17:30.201
Genny was cool about it, said
it was gonna take time for us

17:30.206 --> 17:31.581
to trust her again.

17:31.586 --> 17:34.272
So I gave her some cash for a cab,

17:34.836 --> 17:37.621
and then I don't know
what happened to her.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.501
I guess I should--

17:41.167 --> 17:43.172
I can't understand it.

17:56.316 --> 17:58.593
Any luck with the
confidential informant packet?

17:58.598 --> 18:00.050
We're checking names
in it against the ones

18:00.057 --> 18:02.383
Gennifer was rattling
off in your interview.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.851
According to the C.I. file,

18:04.936 --> 18:09.193
Gennifer's dealer is a guy named

18:09.195 --> 18:13.972
Juliano Blake aka Juliano Batista.

18:13.975 --> 18:16.413
Ok, lieutenant Provenza
and detective Sanchez,

18:16.415 --> 18:18.531
let's pick him up
first thing tomorrow.

18:18.536 --> 18:21.432
Find out where he was
when Marianne was killed.

18:21.836 --> 18:25.141
Lieutenant Tao, how are we doing
with our victim's next of kin?

18:25.148 --> 18:26.622
Not good.

18:26.635 --> 18:27.731
Why is that?

18:27.735 --> 18:29.782
Marianne's not her real name.

18:29.788 --> 18:32.411
In fact, I think she's
an identity thief.

18:32.416 --> 18:34.123
Oh, for heaven's sake.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.901
Even though Marianne's
prints match her police file,

18:38.906 --> 18:42.180
they don't match the thumbprints
on her driver's license.

18:42.186 --> 18:43.842
Which is fake.

18:43.846 --> 18:45.822
She's living under an alias,

18:45.835 --> 18:48.462
so I have no idea
who she really is.

18:48.468 --> 18:51.982
And all the high-end electronics
we found in the living room

18:51.986 --> 18:54.163
were charged using
Gennifer's credit cards,

18:54.166 --> 18:57.891
but the signatures on the packing
slips match Marianne's phony license.

18:57.895 --> 18:59.900
And all the merchandise was ordered...

18:59.907 --> 19:02.241
While Gennifer was in rehab.

19:02.496 --> 19:05.491
You think maybe these drug
dealers, they were after Gennifer,

19:05.495 --> 19:07.222
killed Marianne by mistake?

19:07.226 --> 19:09.361
I mean, she was in Gennifer's house,

19:09.367 --> 19:11.120
and she was wearing
Gennifer's clothing.

19:11.128 --> 19:12.703
She even fooled the mailman.

19:12.708 --> 19:16.451
Or Gennifer got home from
rehab, and found Marianne,

19:16.456 --> 19:18.543
or whoever the hell she is,
living in her house,

19:18.546 --> 19:22.503
using her drugs, spending her
cash, and bang, she shot her.

19:22.735 --> 19:25.383
Ok, um... just to be clear,

19:25.385 --> 19:27.931
let's go over the different
possibilities we have so far.

19:27.936 --> 19:30.553
Our intended victim is
either Gennifer Rawley,

19:30.556 --> 19:33.852
a confidential informant
currently working for the LAPD,

19:33.857 --> 19:37.971
or Marianne Elzey, whose real
name probably isn't Marianne Elzey,

19:37.985 --> 19:40.581
who stole Gennifer's identity...

19:41.675 --> 19:45.871
Um... for suspects,
we have Gennifer's drug dealer,

19:45.888 --> 19:50.462
or Marianne's possible confederates,
or Gennifer Rawley herself.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.802
Oh, well, that's as clear as crystal.

19:58.776 --> 20:00.022
Hey, Will.

20:00.028 --> 20:01.552
Oh, Fritz, hi.

20:01.555 --> 20:03.831
Hey, how did Brenda
do in the deposition?

20:04.468 --> 20:07.682
Oh, uh... uh...

20:14.557 --> 20:16.822
Hey. You ready?

20:17.047 --> 20:20.303
Heard you were a star in
Pope's custody hearing.

20:20.366 --> 20:23.292
Really? Where'd you hear that?

20:23.297 --> 20:25.292
From Pope. Just ran into him.

20:25.295 --> 20:26.623
Oh.

20:27.116 --> 20:28.911
What-what did he say?

20:29.036 --> 20:30.451
Just that.

20:30.777 --> 20:32.091
Oh.

20:32.548 --> 20:34.821
Wasn't I supposed to know
you were a character witness?

20:34.825 --> 20:37.121
No. No, it's fine. It's fine.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.670
You ready?

20:46.908 --> 20:49.582
Uh, lieutenant Flynn,
have we heard back

20:49.588 --> 20:52.242
from detective Sanchez
and lieutenant Provenza?

20:52.247 --> 20:53.672
Uh, no.

20:53.676 --> 20:55.863
They're still hunting down
Gennifer's drug dealer.

20:55.868 --> 20:57.040
Ok.

20:57.047 --> 21:00.123
Well, y'all know agent Howard,

21:00.136 --> 21:04.633
and one of the jobs related to the
new FBI task force he's working on

21:04.636 --> 21:07.363
is dealing with all
sorts of identity theft.

21:07.368 --> 21:10.133
Which as, y'all know,
is a federal crime.

21:10.138 --> 21:14.371
So, he's, um...
volunteered to help us,

21:14.375 --> 21:17.593
even though this isn't his case...
yet.

21:17.597 --> 21:21.150
But um... begin.

21:21.436 --> 21:24.363
Thanks for that very formal
introduction, chief Johnson.

21:24.367 --> 21:29.921
Guys, this is a map of the area
around Gennifer Rawley's home.

21:30.526 --> 21:32.570
Now in the past 16 months,

21:32.587 --> 21:36.093
there's been a string of similar
I.D. thefts in the general vicinity.

21:36.097 --> 21:39.150
8 homes whose occupants have had their
personal information stolen from them

21:39.156 --> 21:41.860
while they've been away on
vacation, or on business.

21:41.868 --> 21:45.323
Now in each instance, the thieves ran
up thousands of dollars in charges.

21:45.326 --> 21:47.860
In some cases, the
victims had the feeling

21:47.865 --> 21:50.653
someone had actually been
living in their houses.

21:50.655 --> 21:52.013
Doesn't make sense.

21:52.028 --> 21:54.541
Identity theft is a cyber crime.

21:54.548 --> 21:56.891
It's usually not tied
to a specific location.

21:56.905 --> 21:59.200
Unless the thieves are living
in the same neighborhood.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.982
Maybe we can get one of the other
victims to I.D. Marianne for us.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.000
The FBI did extensive
interviews with each family.

22:04.006 --> 22:05.972
They had no idea who hit them.

22:05.978 --> 22:08.373
We didn't even have a name
until you guys found Marianne.

22:08.378 --> 22:11.683
So we're giving you more information
than you're giving us, is that it?

22:11.687 --> 22:13.863
Give me a break. How many times
I have helped you guys out?

22:13.867 --> 22:15.830
And we really
thank you for that, sir.

22:15.838 --> 22:19.732
We do, we really appreciate it,
but in this particular instance

22:19.736 --> 22:24.363
you don't know anyone who'd want
to kill Marianne Elzey either.

22:25.535 --> 22:27.921
Uh, technically, no.

22:28.586 --> 22:29.972
You can't keep her.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.611
Actually, Mr. Rawley, I can.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.183
I have 48 hours before I
have to file formal charges.

22:34.185 --> 22:35.362
You will have to come back tomorrow.

22:35.368 --> 22:37.023
Yeah, well, when I do,
she's going with me,

22:37.027 --> 22:38.040
or I'm getting her a lawyer.

22:38.045 --> 22:40.502
Do you have her durable power
of attorney for legal affairs,

22:40.508 --> 22:42.121
or are you her custodial guardian?

22:42.126 --> 22:45.422
Listen, I don't know if you noticed
yesterday, but my father has Alzheimer's.

22:45.425 --> 22:47.591
My mother's aged 50 years just
trying to take care of him,

22:47.605 --> 22:51.280
so all this business with Genny, it's
just, it's traumatizing for both of them.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.973
My family is falling apart here. We--

22:54.478 --> 22:56.583
We just need Genny to get better.

22:56.587 --> 22:58.483
Mr. Rawley, we have reason to believe

22:58.488 --> 23:00.762
that someone might be
trying to kill your sister.

23:00.768 --> 23:02.692
Now I appreciate that you
are trying to help her,

23:02.696 --> 23:05.312
but it's just not in Genny's
best interest to let her go.

23:05.318 --> 23:08.120
You really don't expect me to believe
that you care about Genny now, do you?

23:08.127 --> 23:10.833
I know how the police
feel about meth addicts.

23:11.696 --> 23:14.001
Listen, listen. I found
her a new specialist.

23:14.006 --> 23:16.682
And he has a rehab that guarantees
results. So if you could just give her--

23:16.687 --> 23:19.372
Genny nearly killed your
father over a television.

23:19.377 --> 23:21.980
She was clearly using a controlled
substance when we found her,

23:21.988 --> 23:25.312
and now, she's either a potential
victim or a murder suspect.

23:25.318 --> 23:28.571
I think you're better off letting me
take care of her for the time being.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.103
So you're gonna make sure
that all of her bills get paid?

23:31.106 --> 23:33.720
And put her mail on hold, stop
the newspapers from coming,

23:33.728 --> 23:37.360
call the gardener, pick up the phone in
the middle of the night when she's high?

23:37.367 --> 23:39.942
- Give me a break.
- Excuse me.

23:40.185 --> 23:43.032
Did you say you put
Genny's mail on hold?

23:43.676 --> 23:46.212
You heard me.
Get out of my way.

23:46.217 --> 23:49.132
You better calm yourself, old man,
and remember who you're talking to.

23:49.135 --> 23:51.060
You better watch that "old man" crap.

23:51.067 --> 23:53.600
And you better remember
that I don't answer to you.

23:53.608 --> 23:56.302
None of you answer to anyone.
That's your damn problem.

23:56.305 --> 23:58.992
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
Lieutenant, what's going on here?

23:59.007 --> 24:01.712
Well, we found Gennifer's
so-called dealer.

24:01.715 --> 24:04.733
The guy listed in the C.I. packet.

24:04.738 --> 24:08.352
Yeah. Had him staked out all night.

24:08.355 --> 24:12.022
Juliano Blake sells car
insurance, for heaven's sakes.

24:12.026 --> 24:14.253
He's no more a drug dealer than I am.

24:14.255 --> 24:17.062
There's nothing that ties him
to Gennifer or biker gangs.

24:17.066 --> 24:20.583
I'm telling you, chief.
Narcotics fed us a bunch of bull!

24:20.585 --> 24:23.541
- You don't know that!
- Ok, commander. Excuse me.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.262
We'll come back to this
in a minute.

24:25.265 --> 24:28.773
Thank you, lieutenant. As it turns
out, we have a new lead in this case

24:28.778 --> 24:31.331
because I just found out that
Gennifer's mail was on hold

24:31.336 --> 24:32.582
while she was in rehab.

24:32.585 --> 24:35.643
Sergeant Gabriel, would you
please put up agent Howard's map.

24:35.988 --> 24:37.893
Yeah. Uh...

24:40.387 --> 24:44.301
Lieutenant Tao, I want to see if all
these houses are on the same postal route.

24:44.307 --> 24:46.050
Yeah, it was the
mailman who called it in.

24:46.056 --> 24:49.091
Sergeant Gabriel and lieutenant Flynn,
would you please bring him to me.

24:49.098 --> 24:50.531
- Special delivery.
- Thank you.

24:50.538 --> 24:54.383
And detective Sanchez, I'd like to hear
that 911 call again from the mailman.

24:54.395 --> 24:55.871
Thank you.

24:56.185 --> 25:00.122
Commander, may I speak with you
privately in chief Pope's office?

25:01.956 --> 25:04.242
Off to the vatican.

25:05.187 --> 25:08.923
With all due respect, sir, she
stepped on 2 years of narcotics work.

25:08.928 --> 25:10.900
Oh, I would hardly call it work.

25:10.907 --> 25:12.901
You were hunting
elephants in a petting zoo.

25:12.907 --> 25:15.833
Operating on unreliable information
from a paranoid drug addict,

25:15.838 --> 25:17.822
and they knew that giving
me Gennifer's C.I. packet,

25:17.828 --> 25:20.170
would expose their investigation
as a complete fraud.

25:20.177 --> 25:21.672
Is this true?

25:21.676 --> 25:24.360
It's accusations like this
that make it impossible

25:24.365 --> 25:27.143
for other divisions to
work with Priority Homicide.

25:27.145 --> 25:28.770
Central's still mad at her.

25:28.775 --> 25:30.772
Hollywood division won't
even take her calls,

25:30.778 --> 25:33.843
and now she's attacking narcotics.

25:35.056 --> 25:39.162
I have less than a day to either
charge or release Gennifer Rawley.

25:39.175 --> 25:41.563
It has been drilled into me
that I have limited resources,

25:41.568 --> 25:43.301
so I want to know right now, commander,

25:43.305 --> 25:45.762
is narcotics pursuing
a valid investigation?

25:45.767 --> 25:50.520
I don't carry all the facts of every
departmental investigation in my hand.

25:50.526 --> 25:53.650
Sometimes I trust the
people who work here.

25:54.076 --> 25:56.810
All right, I want a complete
report from this Rios and Pike.

25:56.818 --> 25:57.821
Yesterday.

25:57.826 --> 25:59.481
You're dismissed, commander.

25:59.615 --> 26:01.182
Yes, sir.

26:02.398 --> 26:03.691
Ma'am.

26:11.715 --> 26:13.512
There's something going on with him.

26:13.518 --> 26:15.513
There's no way he would've
stirred up a ruckus like that

26:15.528 --> 26:16.593
unless he knew something.

26:16.595 --> 26:18.850
Let's not start imagining
things. Brenda, Brenda.

26:18.858 --> 26:20.510
No one has heard anything.

26:20.518 --> 26:24.212
No one will hear anything because I've
hired you the best attorney in L.A.,

26:24.225 --> 26:27.581
and he's having all of your testimony
put under seal by protective order.

26:27.585 --> 26:29.453
Who? Which attorney?

26:29.458 --> 26:32.180
You've sat across from him before.

26:32.245 --> 26:34.002
It's Tom Blanchard.

26:34.008 --> 26:35.791
Tom Blanchard.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.470
You're making my stomach turn.

26:37.477 --> 26:41.471
Well, you may want to skip breakfast
then because he is exactly what you need.

26:45.548 --> 26:46.712
Thank you.

26:46.717 --> 26:48.911
911 operator.
What's the emergency?

26:48.918 --> 26:52.921
I'm a, I'm a letter carrier
for the U.S. post office.

26:52.926 --> 26:55.113
And I have to report a--

26:55.837 --> 26:57.740
oh, my god, I think she's dead.

26:57.748 --> 27:01.050
Sir, can you repeat that?
Have you found a woman's body?

27:01.067 --> 27:03.583
Yeah, well. She's not moving.

27:03.585 --> 27:05.663
Oh, can someone--

27:05.668 --> 27:07.920
Stay on the line, sir.
Someone will be right there.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.733
What's the address?

27:09.925 --> 27:13.610
Gennifer's brother put a
two-month hold on her mail.

27:14.158 --> 27:16.032
Which means that you
wouldn't have been delivering

27:16.038 --> 27:18.511
anything to her for the past 7 weeks.

27:18.515 --> 27:21.280
But as her mailman, you had
access to her credit card bills

27:21.288 --> 27:22.592
and financial statements.

27:22.596 --> 27:24.583
And you knew she wouldn't be
home for a good long while.

27:24.585 --> 27:27.463
Plenty of time for you and this
so-called Marianne Elzey to move in,

27:27.467 --> 27:29.921
have a little party on Gennifer's tab.

27:29.938 --> 27:31.860
No. That ain't true.

27:31.865 --> 27:35.560
Derek, we were able to trace phone
calls made from Gennifer's house

27:35.566 --> 27:38.521
to the cell phone
you used to call 911.

27:40.348 --> 27:43.073
Ok, Mr. Draper.
You got a choice.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.622
You can either stop lying right now

27:44.625 --> 27:47.561
and admit to the relatively
minor crime of identity theft,

27:47.565 --> 27:49.100
or we can arrest you for murder.

27:49.108 --> 27:50.291
Hey, wait. I didn't kill anyone.

27:50.296 --> 27:52.561
Then what did you do, Mr. Draper?

27:52.568 --> 27:54.773
And make me believe you.

28:00.026 --> 28:01.601
Ok, ok, ok.

28:02.716 --> 28:04.970
I... I went through the mail...

28:04.975 --> 28:08.860
I grabbed the pre-approved credit
card statements and the bank stuff.

28:08.868 --> 28:10.532
And you sold the
information to other people.

28:10.537 --> 28:12.260
No, no. It was for us.

28:12.266 --> 28:15.041
Marianne would just use
the info to set up accounts

28:15.045 --> 28:16.420
with P.O. boxes that I gave her,

28:16.426 --> 28:19.281
and sometimes when
people are out of town,

28:19.645 --> 28:21.813
she would just
move in to their houses.

28:21.815 --> 28:26.273
I'd drop off the stuff on my route.
I mean, this stuff was easy to sell.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.943
And, uh, paid for Marianne's habit.

28:28.946 --> 28:29.890
Great.

28:29.897 --> 28:32.943
So you closed the FBI case. Now
get to the part where you kill her.

28:32.948 --> 28:35.172
So you got tired of her spending
all your cash on crystal,

28:35.176 --> 28:37.683
and you shot her,
didn't you, Derek?

28:37.687 --> 28:40.403
No, man. I told you
I didn't do that.

28:40.408 --> 28:42.411
Where were you the night
Marianne was killed?

28:42.416 --> 28:45.482
Look, I have been working nights at
the bulk mail center this whole week.

28:45.485 --> 28:47.120
Now you can check with
my supervisor on that.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.413
I told you,
I did not kill Marianne.

28:49.417 --> 28:51.861
I swear to god, I didn't
kill Marianne. I didn't.

28:51.867 --> 28:55.000
You keep calling her Marianne.
Is that her real name?

28:56.775 --> 28:59.212
- Yes.
- What was her last name?

29:02.608 --> 29:04.731
What was her last name?

29:05.506 --> 29:07.023
Draper.

29:09.077 --> 29:10.943
She was your wife?

29:16.067 --> 29:19.190
You purposely misidentified
Marianne to me?

29:19.866 --> 29:23.141
Your wife is lying in a morgue.

29:24.467 --> 29:26.831
Look, when I called the police, I...

29:27.237 --> 29:29.861
I didn't know she was dead.

29:29.866 --> 29:31.903
She takes sleeping pills.

29:31.908 --> 29:34.741
You know, valium sometimes
to come down, and I just...

29:34.748 --> 29:36.621
I bang on the window,
and she wakes up.

29:36.625 --> 29:38.940
And she would always wake up, and...

29:41.376 --> 29:43.522
she wouldn't wake up.

29:45.387 --> 29:47.573
And I couldn't get in.

29:50.825 --> 29:52.951
Look, don't be mad at me, I just...

29:55.866 --> 29:58.053
I just wanted someone to...

29:58.547 --> 30:00.271
Oh, god.

30:03.867 --> 30:06.272
I just wanted someone to help her.

30:08.878 --> 30:12.210
Looks like we just notified
Marianne's next of kin.

30:12.216 --> 30:13.272
Yeah.

30:13.276 --> 30:16.750
And we still don't know
who killed her, or why.

30:25.986 --> 30:27.573
Oh, hey, guys.

30:27.578 --> 30:29.503
Look what the cat dragged in.

30:29.505 --> 30:32.020
Hey, it's all right, fellows.

30:32.025 --> 30:34.660
Mr. Blanchard here just must be lost.

30:34.677 --> 30:37.963
We don't have any
celebrities in custody today.

30:37.966 --> 30:40.283
Well, actually, lieutenant,
I was looking for your boss.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.402
I believe she's expecting me.

30:42.436 --> 30:44.200
Excuse me.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.623
Come in. Have a seat.

31:07.048 --> 31:11.461
Now, some ground rules
for this next deposition.

31:11.585 --> 31:14.150
First rule, don't do
their jobs for them.

31:14.156 --> 31:15.832
Keep your answers short and simple.

31:15.835 --> 31:18.221
Don't guess, don't argue.

31:18.226 --> 31:20.510
Mr. Blanchard, are
you honestly telling me

31:20.517 --> 31:22.250
how to conduct
myself in an interview?

31:22.255 --> 31:24.601
Ms. Johnson, you're
about to enter a room

31:24.606 --> 31:27.300
where you don't get
to ask the questions.

31:30.507 --> 31:32.323
Ok. Fine.

31:32.826 --> 31:35.992
Now, so that we may avoid
any further surprises,

31:35.997 --> 31:39.232
I need to know all the facts about
your relationship with chief Pope.

31:39.237 --> 31:42.741
And please, tell me everything.

31:45.826 --> 31:47.750
So, what do you want to know?

31:47.756 --> 31:50.470
- Well, how did you two meet?
- That's classified.

31:52.037 --> 31:54.432
Um... I met him back east.

31:54.435 --> 31:57.433
He was assistant chief
to the D.C. Police.

31:57.438 --> 31:59.791
And I was an official
liaison officer with them

31:59.796 --> 32:04.200
from an organization I can't
mention because of a separation oath.

32:04.206 --> 32:05.972
Fascinating.

32:06.658 --> 32:09.351
Are you currently having
an affair with Mr. Pope?

32:09.357 --> 32:11.373
Absolutely not!

32:12.026 --> 32:13.321
We're just friends.

32:13.327 --> 32:15.623
How long have you been...
just friends?

32:15.626 --> 32:17.062
8 1/2 years.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.093
Have you ever received
anything of a personal nature

32:19.098 --> 32:21.253
from chief Pope
in the last 6 months?

32:21.266 --> 32:22.840
Like a...

32:22.898 --> 32:25.600
- gift?
- No. I...

32:27.795 --> 32:30.932
Yes, he...
gave me a birthday present,

32:30.936 --> 32:34.170
but I don't know what's in it.
I haven't opened it yet.

32:34.176 --> 32:37.533
Well, that's remarkable
restraint for a woman.

32:37.808 --> 32:40.571
Do you still have this present?

33:05.425 --> 33:07.051
Oh, my.

33:07.626 --> 33:09.502
My, my, my.

33:10.025 --> 33:12.130
I thought this was silver, but...

33:12.145 --> 33:14.540
it looks and feels more
like platinum.

33:15.378 --> 33:18.540
I may have to keep this,
Ms. Johnson, for your sake.

33:19.507 --> 33:21.471
So that if you're asked
about this present,

33:21.475 --> 33:24.681
you can state frankly
that you never saw it.

33:29.407 --> 33:32.163
You knew I had that gift before
you asked me that question.

33:32.595 --> 33:36.101
Chief Pope did tell me that he had
given you a birthday present. Yes.

33:36.108 --> 33:38.351
But since you didn't open it,

33:38.425 --> 33:40.682
in my opinion, he was wrong.

33:41.478 --> 33:45.372
In other words, Mr. Pope described
only what he thought he had done.

33:45.498 --> 33:48.133
Not what had actually happened.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.802
Do you understand what I'm
saying here, Ms. Johnson?

33:52.805 --> 33:54.410
Are you with me?

33:55.966 --> 33:57.932
Yes, I...

33:58.037 --> 33:59.882
I'm with you, I...

34:00.877 --> 34:02.481
I just...

34:02.655 --> 34:05.782
Just, just give me one
minute, please. Thank you.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.681
Sergeant Gabriel, Gennifer's brother
will be coming to pick her up,

34:11.686 --> 34:13.373
and he's gonna want to
call a lawyer for her.

34:13.376 --> 34:14.560
I don't want that to happen.

34:14.565 --> 34:16.842
- I'll stall him then.
- That would be good.

34:16.848 --> 34:18.913
Lieutenant Tao, before
I speak with her again,

34:18.917 --> 34:20.721
I need Gennifer Rawley's
cell phone records.

34:20.737 --> 34:23.081
Dump every phone she's got,
and every phone she's called.

34:23.085 --> 34:24.460
- Thank you.
- Why?

34:24.465 --> 34:27.790
Because... she talks too much.

34:32.565 --> 34:34.219
Your 48 hours are almost up,

34:34.226 --> 34:37.803
and you shouldn't even try to question
Genny when she's in this condition.

34:37.804 --> 34:38.891
I'm getting her an attorney.

34:38.896 --> 34:40.523
You are not her guardian.

34:40.525 --> 34:41.751
She's an adult.

34:41.755 --> 34:43.351
And no lawyer is
coming into this room

34:43.357 --> 34:45.141
unless Genny specifically requests one.

34:45.148 --> 34:46.841
Then let me talk to her.

34:46.846 --> 34:48.882
By refusing to let me talk to my sister

34:48.888 --> 34:50.610
and then questioning her
without an attorney present,

34:50.618 --> 34:52.860
you're laying the
groundwork for an appeal.

34:53.106 --> 34:54.603
All right.

34:54.607 --> 34:57.150
Maybe it would be good
for you to hear the truth.

34:57.158 --> 34:59.633
But if you even mention the
word lawyer in my interview room,

34:59.646 --> 35:02.542
it better be because you
want one. Do you understand?

35:04.295 --> 35:07.021
Sammy. Sammy, get me out of here.

35:07.027 --> 35:09.712
Don't worry. That's
exactly what I'm gonna do.

35:10.048 --> 35:13.981
Gennifer, last time we spoke,
you weren't quite yourself, so,

35:13.996 --> 35:16.223
just so we're all
clear about your rights,

35:16.227 --> 35:18.610
sergeant Gabriel's going
to read them to y'all now.

35:18.618 --> 35:21.182
Whatever happened to good
old fashioned alcohol?

35:21.186 --> 35:23.853
All right, it rots your liver, and
you're a pain in the ass at parties,

35:23.858 --> 35:28.552
but it takes at least 20 years for it
to make you look as bad as this girl.

35:28.817 --> 35:31.030
Do you understand these rights?

35:33.415 --> 35:36.163
Sorry, Sammy. I'm sorry.

35:36.165 --> 35:38.522
I know, I know.

35:38.527 --> 35:41.411
Gennifer, I'm gonna ask you
some very important questions.

35:41.415 --> 35:43.522
I feel sick.
Talk to Rios and Pike.

35:43.527 --> 35:45.692
I did. I spoke with Rios and Pike.

35:45.696 --> 35:49.193
And I can safely say that there are
no drug dealers trying to kill you.

35:49.198 --> 35:50.971
Yes. Yes, there are.

35:50.978 --> 35:53.000
Look at her. She's exhausted.
Let me take her home.

35:53.016 --> 35:54.753
No. I don't want to go home.

35:54.757 --> 35:57.320
I wouldn't step foot in my house.
People are trying to kill me.

35:57.327 --> 36:00.232
But you did go home.
See, you took a cab

36:00.245 --> 36:04.372
from your parents' house in
Newport Beach to yours in L.A.

36:07.858 --> 36:09.261
Yes.

36:10.685 --> 36:14.351
I went home, but then I
hid. Someone was in my house.

36:14.365 --> 36:16.682
I saw the light on, and so,

36:16.688 --> 36:19.481
I... I hid. I hid in my hole.

36:19.626 --> 36:22.183
You're talking about the
mattress in your guest house

36:22.186 --> 36:25.960
where you cut out a little space
for yourself and hid to feel safe?

36:25.966 --> 36:28.240
How did you know about that?
Who told you about that?

36:28.245 --> 36:30.102
I saw your suitcases there.

36:30.106 --> 36:32.703
The ones you brought
back from rehab.

36:33.885 --> 36:35.332
You're part of it.

36:35.336 --> 36:38.020
Sammy, Sammy,
she's part of it, Sammy.

36:38.027 --> 36:39.882
She only gets like this
when she's been high.

36:39.887 --> 36:42.820
When I went to the rehab and
picked her up, she was fine.

36:42.828 --> 36:45.332
Honestly, she was sober.

36:45.337 --> 36:48.742
But she didn't stay
sober long. Did she?

36:48.746 --> 36:51.680
She called you just a few hours
after you picked her up from rehab,

36:51.695 --> 36:54.430
from her cell phone to yours.

36:54.617 --> 36:57.243
She went home, and she got high,

36:57.247 --> 36:59.051
and then you talked to her,
didn't you?

36:59.067 --> 37:02.603
Trying to calm her down, but you
couldn't calm her down, could you?

37:02.607 --> 37:05.470
No, I couldn't. She was going on
about people trying to kill her.

37:05.476 --> 37:08.152
- And you believed her?
- She was completely paranoid.

37:08.158 --> 37:10.173
You spoke to her about
it for a good long time.

37:10.177 --> 37:12.802
Yeah, I was trying to
calm her down. Yes.

37:12.805 --> 37:14.940
While you were on the road.

37:15.095 --> 37:16.941
Excuse me? What?

37:16.947 --> 37:20.453
Each cell phone has
its own unique identity.

37:20.727 --> 37:22.683
Just like people.

37:23.206 --> 37:24.783
That conversation
that you just admitted

37:24.788 --> 37:26.740
to having with your
sister lasted 45 minutes

37:26.748 --> 37:29.943
while you were driving to
her house from Newport Beach.

37:29.946 --> 37:32.362
See, while you were
listening to Gennifer,

37:32.375 --> 37:35.663
your cell phone was giving
us its exact location.

37:35.668 --> 37:38.331
And you were traveling
northbound on the 405

37:38.336 --> 37:40.401
from Orange County to Los Angeles.

37:40.406 --> 37:43.293
We tracked you from the moment
Gennifer called you at 3am,

37:43.297 --> 37:47.190
to the moment you ended the
call at 3:48am near her house.

37:47.196 --> 37:48.731
No. That's not true.

37:48.738 --> 37:50.953
You see, when you were
on the phone with Genny,

37:50.957 --> 37:53.071
you thought that she
was using drugs again,

37:53.075 --> 37:54.983
but you had to be sure.

37:55.045 --> 37:56.863
And then when you entered her house,

37:56.867 --> 37:58.903
you smelled the methamphetamine.

37:58.905 --> 38:01.011
And you knew what she'd been doing.

38:01.018 --> 38:04.291
So you grabbed Gennifer's gun,
and you shot her in the head.

38:04.297 --> 38:04.933
No!

38:04.936 --> 38:07.803
That's why you told your
family that Genny was dead

38:07.808 --> 38:09.291
when sergeant Gabriel
called the house

38:09.305 --> 38:12.292
even though he only called to tell
you to come down to the station

38:12.298 --> 38:15.063
because you were describing
what you thought had happened.

38:15.068 --> 38:17.113
Not what actually did.

38:17.115 --> 38:19.243
You meant to murder
your sister, but instead,

38:19.247 --> 38:22.471
you killed a young woman
who had stolen her identity.

38:22.766 --> 38:25.950
Sammy... is that...

38:27.198 --> 38:29.471
You tried to kill me?

38:41.596 --> 38:45.322
You ruined our lives, Gen.

38:45.597 --> 38:49.651
With lie after lie
after lie after lie.

38:49.656 --> 38:53.203
Did you ever once put
us ahead of getting high?

38:53.205 --> 38:54.853
Ever?

39:01.666 --> 39:05.702
Sergeant Gabriel, would you
escort Ms. Rawley outside please.

39:06.747 --> 39:08.751
Let's go. Let's go.

39:12.248 --> 39:13.792
Sammy?

39:16.707 --> 39:18.901
I'm sorry.

39:18.977 --> 39:21.231
Don't worry about it.

39:21.315 --> 39:25.583
An hour after you leave here,
you'll have forgotten all about this.

39:27.436 --> 39:28.642
Let's go.

39:40.297 --> 39:43.132
So, Gen gets to walk out
of here free,

39:43.136 --> 39:46.473
and I go to jail for
the rest of my life?

39:46.548 --> 39:49.190
She was arrested so many
times for possession.

39:49.195 --> 39:53.640
Did it never once occur to you people
that maybe she belonged in jail?

39:54.146 --> 39:58.062
All I wanted to do was stop
her from traumatizing my family.

39:58.066 --> 40:00.723
It was self defense.

40:02.055 --> 40:04.872
You may be right about that.

40:07.186 --> 40:10.453
But you're defending yourself
against the wrong person.

40:15.997 --> 40:19.501
And now your parents have
lost both their children.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.240
We're here to talk about family

40:26.245 --> 40:30.230
and the threat posed to family
when the father isn't up to the job.

40:30.236 --> 40:32.640
Ms. Johnson, since you
arrived in Los Angeles,

40:32.645 --> 40:35.290
you and Will Pope have
worked very closely together.

40:35.295 --> 40:38.110
Long days.
Sometimes long nights.

40:38.117 --> 40:39.441
Weekends.

40:39.447 --> 40:42.622
How much time does Mr. Pope actually
have to spend with his children

40:42.628 --> 40:44.650
when it's really you
he's spending time with?

40:44.656 --> 40:46.642
- Objection.
- On what grounds?

40:46.645 --> 40:48.951
Your question is
argumentative, harassing,

40:48.955 --> 40:50.761
and ends with a preposition.

40:50.766 --> 40:52.422
Kindly rephrase.

40:52.428 --> 40:53.530
This is ridiculous.

40:53.535 --> 40:56.350
Chief Pope and I are
not having an affair.

40:56.366 --> 41:00.330
Excuse me, Ms. Johnson.
Will you kindly refrain from speaking.

41:01.856 --> 41:03.442
Now, Barbara...

41:04.577 --> 41:07.203
If you're going to pursue
this line of questioning,

41:07.208 --> 41:11.662
I would remind you that chief Pope didn't
leave his first wife for Ms. Johnson.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.600
He left her for Estelle.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.733
And unlike the future ex Mrs. Pope,

41:15.736 --> 41:18.230
whose infidelity brings
us here in the first place,

41:18.237 --> 41:22.193
Ms. Johnson has never
broken a vow of marriage.

41:22.198 --> 41:25.332
So any attempt by
your client to besmirch

41:25.335 --> 41:28.611
deputy chief Johnson's reputation
will be considered harassment.

41:28.616 --> 41:32.620
And grounds for a very long,
expensive and embarrassing lawsuit.

41:32.628 --> 41:35.822
During which I will drag
your client into court,

41:35.828 --> 41:40.413
and we can examine Estelle
Pope's adulterous behavior.

41:40.546 --> 41:43.291
With vigorous attention to detail.

41:43.296 --> 41:45.200
Are you getting all this?

41:46.108 --> 41:50.763
Now, as it regards the best
interests of the children,

41:50.767 --> 41:54.790
my client has already testified as
to Mr. Pope's fitness as a father.

41:54.996 --> 41:57.910
And she would also like
to stipulate for the record

41:57.915 --> 42:02.860
that Mr. Pope is her colleague, her
superior officer, and her friend.

42:02.867 --> 42:06.612
Fade out, roll credits, the end.

42:06.917 --> 42:09.030
Any more questions?

42:10.055 --> 42:11.613
No.

42:22.237 --> 42:24.581
- That went well.
- Yes.

42:24.588 --> 42:26.401
Yes, it did.

42:26.948 --> 42:29.830
So, now that it's all over...

42:29.836 --> 42:33.773
You'd like to know...
what the gift was.

42:33.797 --> 42:37.463
Yes, I... I would. If that's ok.

42:37.846 --> 42:39.532
It's not.

42:44.366 --> 42:45.983
Mr. Blanchard.

42:45.986 --> 42:49.720
I hope I never, ever need you again.

42:49.728 --> 42:53.911
Oh... I hope you do.
