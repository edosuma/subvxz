WEBVTT

00:04.445 --> 00:05.800
I mean, there were rumors
that they were gonna

00:05.928 --> 00:08.393
announce it next month, but they
must have gotten impatient. Okay.

00:08.513 --> 00:10.368
Whatever they say,
we need to come up

00:10.410 --> 00:14.609
with 10,000 possible responses
to 10,000 possible scenarios.

00:14.836 --> 00:16.068
Okay, just to remind you,

00:16.104 --> 00:17.838
I don't work for the National
Park Service.

00:17.872 --> 00:19.106
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How are those scenarios coming?

00:19.140 --> 00:20.374
Okay, look.

00:20.408 --> 00:22.028
Before we go in there,
you need to know something.

00:22.335 --> 00:23.936
- He's here.
- Who's here?

00:23.970 --> 00:25.604
The guy whose name you forbid
me from saying

00:25.639 --> 00:26.872
out loud because it fills you
with rage.

00:26.906 --> 00:28.140
[Groans]

00:28.174 --> 00:29.508
Look, I don't know
who he's working for,

00:29.542 --> 00:30.776
but I guess he's part of one
of the bidding groups.

00:30.810 --> 00:32.211
Are you gonna be able
to be civil in there?

00:32.244 --> 00:33.612
I'm perfectly civil.

00:33.647 --> 00:35.347
He's the stupid garbage-head
doo-doo face.

00:35.382 --> 00:36.482
Perfect.

00:36.516 --> 00:37.850
Thank you all for coming.

00:37.884 --> 00:40.552
I am Trevor Nelson, legal
council to the Newport family.

00:40.587 --> 00:44.557
The Newport family trust intends
to sell a 25-square mile parcel

00:44.591 --> 00:48.427
of pristine, undeveloped land
containing Lake Eagleton

00:48.461 --> 00:50.129
and the Southern Indiana
foothills.

00:50.163 --> 00:51.363
Why now?

00:51.398 --> 00:53.365
The Newports have owned this
land for 100 years.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.868
Thanks to the recent economic
boom in Pawnee,

00:55.902 --> 00:57.636
real estate prices are at an all
time high.

00:57.671 --> 01:00.239
And in the words of
Jessica Wicks-Newport, heir

01:00.273 --> 01:02.808
to the entire Newport fortune,
quote, "It's time to trade

01:02.842 --> 01:05.376
those dumb, old trees
for a butt load of cash."

01:05.412 --> 01:07.846
It is.
It truly is.

01:07.881 --> 01:10.683
This land is begging to be
a new national park.

01:10.717 --> 01:12.151
And it's in my own backyard.

01:12.185 --> 01:13.385
This could be my crowning
achievement.

01:13.420 --> 01:14.653
I could retire.

01:14.688 --> 01:15.888
I mean, I wouldn't.

01:15.922 --> 01:17.289
I'm gonna work until I'm 100

01:17.324 --> 01:19.158
and then cut back to four days
a week.

01:19.192 --> 01:22.261
Oh, God, I'm already so bored
thinking about that one day off.

01:22.295 --> 01:23.996
Maybe I'll go to law school
or something.

01:24.030 --> 01:25.397
We will select the finalists

01:25.432 --> 01:28.567
from a set of initial sealed
bids due at 5:00 P.M. tomorrow.

01:28.602 --> 01:29.568
Good luck.

01:29.603 --> 01:31.236
- Okay.
- Cool.

01:31.271 --> 01:32.204
- There he is.
- What?

01:32.238 --> 01:33.539
- Okay.
- He's here?

01:33.573 --> 01:34.873
- He is coming over.
- I don't want to talk to him.

01:34.908 --> 01:35.975
I should hide.
No, he should hide.

01:36.009 --> 01:37.276
He should run.
He should run away.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.312
He should hide his stupid face.
He shouldn't be--

01:43.016 --> 01:45.017
Hello, Ms. Knope.

01:45.051 --> 01:49.088
Hello, former strange person
I used to friend.

01:49.122 --> 01:53.525
You're looking very...
Ron-like.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.227
- You have your same hair.
- No, I don't.

01:55.262 --> 01:56.262
I have bangs now.

01:56.296 --> 01:57.463
I've never known what bangs are,

01:57.497 --> 01:58.618
and I don't intend to learn.

01:58.631 --> 02:00.032
Well, maybe you should!

02:00.066 --> 02:02.735
I left the parks department
two years ago.

02:02.769 --> 02:04.136
Now I work in
the private sector,

02:04.170 --> 02:06.438
running my own building
and development company.

02:06.473 --> 02:09.775
It's called very good building
and development company.

02:09.809 --> 02:11.677
I wanted to convey the quality
of our work

02:11.711 --> 02:13.479
without seeming flashy.

02:13.513 --> 02:16.415
So your company is involved
with one of the bidders?

02:16.449 --> 02:19.051
Hell yeah, pimp!

02:19.085 --> 02:20.753
He's on team Gryzzl now.

02:20.787 --> 02:22.888
We, uh, hired his company
to help plan and build

02:22.923 --> 02:24.690
our new Gryzzl campus.

02:24.724 --> 02:26.659
Right here in town.
Oh, and that land?

02:26.693 --> 02:28.294
Oh, my gosh.
It's perfect.

02:28.328 --> 02:30.663
The trees and rocks and sky.

02:30.697 --> 02:33.832
Yes, the land has good sky.

02:33.867 --> 02:36.068
Sky!
He's so far out.

02:36.102 --> 02:38.837
So norm-core.

02:38.872 --> 02:42.141
You know that the National
Park System deserves this land.

02:42.175 --> 02:43.742
Why are you trying to screw me?

02:43.777 --> 02:45.811
This is like Morning Star all
over again.

02:45.845 --> 02:47.579
This is nothing like
Morning Star.

02:47.614 --> 02:49.515
And that was two years ago.

02:49.549 --> 02:50.683
Well, you don't know
who you're dealing with.

02:50.717 --> 02:53.152
I directly oversee 1,200 people.

02:53.186 --> 02:56.422
I have a staff
of creative geniuses

02:56.456 --> 02:59.992
that will not stop working
until we win this bid.

03:00.026 --> 03:01.160
Leslie?

03:01.194 --> 03:02.461
I-I couldn't find that file
you wanted,

03:02.495 --> 03:06.198
but I did find a file called
bird census, 1980.

03:06.232 --> 03:08.734
- And...it's empty.
- Get out of here, Ed!

03:08.768 --> 03:09.935
- I fired you.
- Right.

03:09.970 --> 03:12.441
If anyone wants to hang,
I will be at Subway.

03:15.775 --> 03:16.942
He's very stupid.

03:16.977 --> 03:20.679

03:37.831 --> 03:39.098
Babe?

03:39.132 --> 03:40.366
Just dropped off Leslie's
triplets with her mom.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.734
All three of 'em.
Nailed it.

03:41.768 --> 03:43.302
Look what she gave us.
Slow cooker.

03:43.336 --> 03:44.670
- Great.
- Yeah.

03:44.704 --> 03:47.064
Um, so hurry up and get ready.
The gala starts in an hour.

03:47.073 --> 03:49.241
And don't forget, tomorrow we
have to go to that guy's office

03:49.276 --> 03:50.576
to sign the renter's insurance
forms.

03:50.610 --> 03:52.177
Get ready.
Go.

03:52.212 --> 03:53.812
Everything is going great.

03:53.847 --> 03:56.282
April's kicking ass at her
National Parks job.

03:56.316 --> 04:00.486
Uh, I work there part time.
And I have my own TV show.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.988
Welcome back to the
Johnny Karate Super Awesome

04:03.023 --> 04:04.423
Musical Explosion Hour.

04:04.457 --> 04:06.859
[Cheering children]

04:06.893 --> 04:09.128
Morning, Johnny.
I have something for ya.

04:09.162 --> 04:11.497
It's Mailman Barry.
Morning, Barry.

04:11.531 --> 04:13.632
- I have something for you.
- Andy, no.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.235
- Ninjas attack!
- No.

04:16.269 --> 04:18.470
Oh!
That's my crotch.

04:18.505 --> 04:20.505
Okay, guys.
Three more kicks a piece.

04:21.841 --> 04:23.509
Uh, Jessica?
Hi.

04:23.543 --> 04:25.023
I'm glad I caught you
before you left.

04:25.045 --> 04:27.146
Just between you and me,
what do you think your land

04:27.180 --> 04:28.681
might sell for tomorrow?

04:28.715 --> 04:33.085
Trevor says it'll probably be
around $90 million.

04:33.119 --> 04:34.887
Ah ha!
Woo!

04:34.921 --> 04:36.922
- Oh.
- Oh--oh, wow.

04:36.957 --> 04:40.459
I know.
I am just--I am so happy for me.

04:40.493 --> 04:42.728
Would you ever consider giving
the federal government

04:42.762 --> 04:43.729
a discount?

04:43.763 --> 04:46.632
For a very good cause?
A national park.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.467
Oh, Leslie.
I have always liked you.

04:48.501 --> 04:49.781
Yeah, no, you haven't, though.

04:49.803 --> 04:54.306
But I also like money.
And money pays for my lifestyle.

04:54.341 --> 04:56.809
Leslie doesn't pay for my
lifestyle, money does.

04:56.843 --> 04:59.712
So between money and Leslie...

04:59.746 --> 05:01.547
Uhh.

05:01.581 --> 05:05.084
- You see the bind that I'm in?
- Yeah, it's a tough one.

05:05.118 --> 05:06.151
Well, thank you, Jessica.

05:06.186 --> 05:07.620
You did and said exactly
what I thought

05:07.654 --> 05:09.088
you were gonna do and say.

05:09.122 --> 05:12.925
- And that's oddly comforting.
- Thank you, sweetie.

05:12.959 --> 05:18.597
Who is Tom Haverford?
He's a mentor, a lover, a hero.

05:18.632 --> 05:21.433
But who is my hero?
Simple.

05:21.468 --> 05:23.569
It's me.
Five years from now.

05:23.603 --> 05:24.703
Okay, I really only need

05:24.738 --> 05:26.572
a correct spelling
of your last name.

05:26.606 --> 05:29.108
You are looking at one of
Indiana Business monthly's

05:29.142 --> 05:30.776
35 under 35.

05:30.810 --> 05:32.478
I own Pawnee's
hottest restaurant,

05:32.512 --> 05:36.015
two fast-casual eateries,
and the Tommy Chopper.

05:36.049 --> 05:37.549
We serve chopped salads
out of a decommissioned

05:37.584 --> 05:39.385
military helicopter.

05:39.419 --> 05:41.120
I'm a mogul now.

05:41.154 --> 05:42.187
Hey, Tom?

05:42.222 --> 05:44.156
Ben Wyatt, city manager
of Pawnee.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.591
Chamber of Commerce asked me
to introduce him

05:45.625 --> 05:47.760
at a very fancy black tie gala
tonight.

05:47.794 --> 05:49.161
One of the many area big wigs

05:49.195 --> 05:51.530
who comes to me for life advice,
fashion tips.

05:51.565 --> 05:53.332
Uh, you get it.
Write this all down.

05:53.366 --> 05:54.600
So for the introduction,

05:54.634 --> 05:56.268
I'd love it if you could just
keep it brief.

05:56.303 --> 05:57.770
Like, stick to my fiscal
accomplishments.

05:57.804 --> 05:59.104
[Snores]

05:59.139 --> 06:01.407
Oh, wanna wake me up when you're
done boring us to death?

06:01.441 --> 06:02.741
Am I right, Janet?

06:02.776 --> 06:04.143
[Laughs]

06:04.177 --> 06:06.245
Write down that I'm funny.

06:06.279 --> 06:08.080
Benji?
Relax, come on.

06:08.114 --> 06:10.049
When's Tommy ever let you down?

06:10.083 --> 06:11.584
Constantly.

06:11.618 --> 06:14.553
I'm being honored at a gala
tonight because I'm in charge

06:14.587 --> 06:17.323
of the Pawnee bicentennial
celebration.

06:17.357 --> 06:19.358
It's my biggest project since
ice town.

06:19.392 --> 06:21.627
So it really means a lot
that I'm being recognized

06:21.661 --> 06:24.363
as a city leader,
instead of being yelled at

06:24.397 --> 06:27.499
and pelted with things.

06:27.534 --> 06:29.301
Wait, you don't think
this is all an elaborate setup

06:29.336 --> 06:32.371
to pelt me with things, do you?

06:32.405 --> 06:34.840
It takes like eight hours
to cook something in this thing.

06:34.874 --> 06:37.009
I guess I could pick up
a brisket tomorrow

06:37.043 --> 06:38.644
and start it for dinner
Thursday.

06:38.678 --> 06:39.712
Oh, Thursday's no good.

06:39.746 --> 06:41.947
I have production meetings
all day.

06:41.982 --> 06:44.183
Then we've got dinner
with Joe and Donna on Friday.

06:44.217 --> 06:45.918
Hey, you know, Sunday.

06:45.952 --> 06:46.986
We can go
to the farmer's market,

06:47.020 --> 06:48.554
put the brisket
in the slow cooker,

06:48.588 --> 06:50.055
get a movie on pay per view.

06:50.090 --> 06:52.391
The new Jason Bourne movie's
supposed to be pretty funny.

06:52.425 --> 06:53.993
[Screams]

06:54.027 --> 06:57.062
Andy?
We're planning our whole week.

06:57.097 --> 06:58.130
Like old people.

06:58.164 --> 06:59.665
We used to be spontaneous
and weird.

06:59.699 --> 07:01.100
We used to eat cereal
out of frisbees

07:01.134 --> 07:02.534
because we didn't have
any bowls.

07:02.569 --> 07:04.436
You once broke a rib trying
to wrestle one of those

07:04.471 --> 07:05.804
inflatable floppy guys
at a car dealership.

07:05.839 --> 07:07.072
I won.

07:07.107 --> 07:08.207
Now you sprained your shoulder
trying to clean out

07:08.241 --> 07:09.742
the stupid gutter.

07:09.776 --> 07:12.344
You even have a job.
We have a bank account!

07:12.379 --> 07:13.846
That's it.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.115
We've held out as long as we
could, but it finally happened.

07:16.149 --> 07:17.616
We're boring.

07:17.651 --> 07:19.485
We're boring people who will
bore each other by being boring.

07:19.519 --> 07:21.186
No!
We are still fun.

07:21.221 --> 07:22.421
I'm gonna prove it to you.

07:22.455 --> 07:24.690
Tonight at the gala,
we are gonna do something

07:24.724 --> 07:26.725
spontaneous and weird.

07:26.760 --> 07:30.696
Okay.

07:30.730 --> 07:32.998
Stop taunting me.

07:33.033 --> 07:34.313
Get on the phone to Washington.

07:34.334 --> 07:36.101
Call in every favor
that we have.

07:36.136 --> 07:37.803
Dave, put Missouri on the back
burner.

07:37.837 --> 07:39.138
This is top priority.

07:39.172 --> 07:41.874
You all have 36 hours
to find me $90 million.

07:41.908 --> 07:42.908
Go!

07:42.943 --> 07:44.810
Whoa, $90 million?

07:44.845 --> 07:46.245
Well, I only have $2 million

07:46.279 --> 07:48.480
in the discretionary fund
and I've already used some of it

07:48.515 --> 07:50.416
to make Thomas Jefferson sexier

07:50.450 --> 07:52.718
in those Mount Rushmore
promotions.

07:52.752 --> 07:54.486
Which, by the way, attendance
has been up.

07:54.521 --> 07:55.921
That's not a coincidence.

07:55.956 --> 07:58.190
Pawnee's rich and famous
will all be here tonight.

07:58.224 --> 08:00.526
- Maybe you start there.
- That is a very smart idea.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.395
And that tuxedo makes you look
like a sexy orchestra conductor.

08:03.430 --> 08:04.830
- Here, wave this pen around.
- Focus.

08:04.864 --> 08:06.999
Fine.
Let's go get that park.

08:07.033 --> 08:09.702
That park is my dream.
I'm not gonna let it slip away.

08:09.736 --> 08:12.171
Who cares if Gryzzl and Ron
have more money?

08:12.205 --> 08:14.673
I have the most valuable
currency in America.

08:14.708 --> 08:18.351
A blind, stubborn belief that
what I am doing is 100% right.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.969
Ken Hotate.
Great bow tie, is that new?

08:25.003 --> 08:27.405
Why, yes it is.
My son sells them on Etsy.

08:27.439 --> 08:29.307
He is a huge disappointment.

08:29.341 --> 08:30.575
Oh, well.

08:30.609 --> 08:32.342
Now that we're chatting,
the National Park Service

08:32.376 --> 08:35.113
is looking to buy
the Newport land.

08:35.147 --> 08:36.914
But we're a little short
on funds.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.717
- How short?
- $88 million.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.687
What do you say you put some of
that casino money to good use?

08:42.721 --> 08:44.322
You know, we have been
considering opening

08:44.356 --> 08:45.323
a second resort.

08:45.357 --> 08:46.757
No, it would be a donation.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.153
The government would keep
the land.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.328
So you would like the Wamapoke
people to pay

08:50.362 --> 08:53.664
the federal government millions
of dollars to buy land

08:53.699 --> 08:56.501
that was stolen from us
by the federal government?

08:56.535 --> 08:58.369
And we don't even get to keep
the land?

08:58.403 --> 09:00.938
Well, when you put it like
that, I see the irony.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.907
So are you in?
No?

09:02.941 --> 09:04.942
What if I buy some of your
disappointing son's bolo ties?

09:04.977 --> 09:05.910
Damn it.

09:05.944 --> 09:06.911
Hey, check it out.

09:06.945 --> 09:07.979
I'm so crazy and spontaneous,

09:08.013 --> 09:09.213
I don't even need this sling
anymore.

09:09.248 --> 09:10.648
- Yes.
- Pa-dow.

09:10.682 --> 09:13.184
Oh!
Oh, did you hear that pop?

09:13.218 --> 09:14.485
Could you hear that?

09:14.520 --> 09:17.121
- You wanna do shots?
- Yeah, I'd love to do a shot.

09:17.156 --> 09:19.056
'Cause wine makes me sleepy now.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.892
This is gonna be fun.
What do you want to do first?

09:20.926 --> 09:22.059
Ooh.

09:22.094 --> 09:25.029
I dare you to eat this entire
jug of olives.

09:25.063 --> 09:27.198
Done!

09:27.232 --> 09:28.699
- What are you doing?
- I'mma take a Zantac.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.101
All that salt will give me
heartburn.

09:30.135 --> 09:31.335
Oh, God.
You ruined it.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.204
We--we have to figure something
else out.

09:33.238 --> 09:34.572
Should I still take the Zantac?

09:34.606 --> 09:37.575
Yeah, you always feel better
when you do.

09:37.609 --> 09:39.410
Oh, my God, I hate us!

09:39.445 --> 09:40.745
Let's go.

09:40.779 --> 09:43.714
Now, I know all of you are off
doing your own things

09:43.749 --> 09:45.983
and we don't see each other
as much as we used to,

09:46.018 --> 09:48.252
but I need my old team back
for one last mission.

09:48.287 --> 09:51.622
So hands in.
Defeat Ron on three.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.391
- One, two, three!
- Ooh.

09:53.425 --> 09:56.160
Actually, Ron promised me
I could build a restaurant

09:56.195 --> 10:00.264
on the new Gryzzl campus so I'm
kind of totally on Ron's side.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.399
Okay.
Tom's dead to me.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.234
Donna?
Waiting for your hand.

10:03.268 --> 10:07.171
Yeah, Ron hired Regal Meagle
realty to broker the deal.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.473
And I'm gonna need the money
for my wedding.

10:09.508 --> 10:10.842
[Gasps]

10:10.876 --> 10:12.710
Shia LaBeouf-designed wedding
dresses do not come cheap.

10:12.744 --> 10:14.045
Oh, my God, you're getting
married?

10:14.079 --> 10:16.647
That's amazing.
And you didn't tell me earlier?

10:16.682 --> 10:17.782
How could you?

10:17.816 --> 10:19.150
Joe popped the question
a few days ago.

10:19.184 --> 10:20.518
I didn't post anything
on Gryzzlfeed

10:20.552 --> 10:22.220
'cause I wanted to tell you
in person.

10:22.254 --> 10:25.623
This is very beautiful.
And I'm furious at you.

10:25.657 --> 10:26.824
How are you?
How are the kids?

10:26.859 --> 10:28.259
Oh, they're great.
You know.

10:28.293 --> 10:29.794
They're trying to destroy us.
There's three of them.

10:29.828 --> 10:31.062
It's insane.
But they're great.

10:31.096 --> 10:33.631
We gotta run, Les.
Sorry for totally crushing it.

10:33.665 --> 10:36.667
And you in the process.
Later.

10:36.702 --> 10:40.671
Well, never fear,
because Terry is here.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.240
Yes, I go by Terry now.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.775
Because there was a guy
at National Parks,

10:43.809 --> 10:45.209
he was already named Larry.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.478
So they suggested I go by Terry.

10:47.513 --> 10:51.249
And then I said my real name is
Gary and they said, who cares.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.818
So.
It's just a fun group.

10:53.852 --> 10:54.986
Good evening,

10:55.020 --> 10:58.222
and welcome to the Pawnee
Bicentennial Gala.

10:58.257 --> 11:02.059
[Applause]

11:02.094 --> 11:05.363
Not long ago, this town
was barely on the map.

11:05.397 --> 11:06.831
Unless you were talking about
a map of the cities

11:06.865 --> 11:10.168
with the most obese pets.

11:10.202 --> 11:13.905
But then, one great man
came along

11:13.939 --> 11:16.574
and he lifted all of us up.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.015
And that man was me.
Tom Haverford.

11:24.049 --> 11:26.951
Owner and proprietor
of the effortlessly chic,

11:26.985 --> 11:30.555
celebrity-packed Italian
restaurant, Tom's Bistro.

11:30.589 --> 11:32.156
And several other
establishments.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.458
Ron?
How could you?

11:33.492 --> 11:35.226
I simply took a skewer
for one shrimp

11:35.260 --> 11:36.661
and added many shrimp to it.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.162
They're long enough
for five or six.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.731
First you try to steal my park
and now you steal my team?

11:40.766 --> 11:42.266
I didn't steal them.

11:42.301 --> 11:45.103
They're independent people who
have moved onto better things,

11:45.137 --> 11:46.871
just like you did.

11:46.905 --> 11:50.108
Bacon-wrapped shrimp.
I fit seven on this one.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.442
It's a masterpiece.

11:51.477 --> 11:52.944
Why don't you shove them all
in your dumb mouth

11:52.978 --> 11:54.679
and then when I turn around,
you can stab me in the back

11:54.713 --> 11:56.147
with the skewer?

11:56.181 --> 11:57.748
People come up to me
and they say things like,

11:57.783 --> 12:00.585
Tom, given all that you've
accomplished,

12:00.619 --> 12:02.753
is it hard to stay humble?

12:02.788 --> 12:06.324
And I say...not for me.

12:06.358 --> 12:09.026
I'm pretty amazing
at being humble.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.729
But, enough about me.

12:11.763 --> 12:13.464
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

12:13.499 --> 12:17.168
Pawnee's man of the year 2017,
Mr. Ben Wyatt.

12:17.202 --> 12:20.037
[Cheers and applause]

12:20.072 --> 12:22.206
Thank you.
Thanks.

12:22.241 --> 12:27.278
And thank you to Tom for that
moving tribute to you.

12:27.312 --> 12:30.181
And thank you to the boys and
girls club for the incredibly

12:30.215 --> 12:32.884
lifelike paper-mache statue.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.352
You know, when I first moved
here--

12:34.386 --> 12:35.920
[interrupting music]

12:35.954 --> 12:39.190
Oh, uh.
I guess it's time for cake?

12:39.224 --> 12:40.658
Okay.
Great.

12:40.692 --> 12:42.760
Perfect.
Timing.

12:42.794 --> 12:44.195
Oh, how about this?

12:44.229 --> 12:45.696
We shut off the lights,

12:45.731 --> 12:48.566
turn 'em back on, everybody's
fancy jewelry is missing.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.470
Meanwhile, you and I are already
on a boat to the airport.

12:52.504 --> 12:54.038
Let's put stink bombs
in all the vents.

12:54.072 --> 12:55.606
- Yes.
- Wait, no.

12:55.641 --> 12:56.574
I forgot.

12:56.608 --> 12:57.675
I got rid of all the stink bombs

12:57.709 --> 13:00.144
before you babysat
Leslie's kids.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.213
Being responsible adults
sucks butts.

13:02.247 --> 13:03.948
Butts, that's it.
I'll streak across the stage.

13:03.982 --> 13:05.216
Yes, I love it.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.485
I'm gonna get naked.
I'm gonna get up there.

13:07.519 --> 13:09.187
Everyone is gonna see my weiner.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.755
I mean, you've seen it.
You know how dumb it looks.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.290
- Uh-huh.
- Perfect plan.

13:13.425 --> 13:14.492
Why are you even here?

13:14.526 --> 13:16.027
What have you ever done
for this city?

13:16.061 --> 13:19.530
My company has stimulated
Pawnee's economy.

13:19.565 --> 13:23.100
You're just still upset about
morning star.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.069
I told you to never say
that word to me.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.904
No one should ever say that word
out loud.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.606
It's like Voldemort.
Or Ron.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.808
You know what?
You don't deserve that candle.

13:30.843 --> 13:31.809
- Gimme that candle!
- Let go.

13:31.844 --> 13:32.810
- Let go.
- This candle's mine.

13:32.845 --> 13:33.911
No, give me this candle.

13:33.946 --> 13:34.912
You steal my team,
I steal your candle.

13:34.947 --> 13:35.947
- I stole nothing.
- Guys?

13:35.948 --> 13:36.914
- Neh.
- Guys?

13:36.949 --> 13:37.915
- I want it!
- Leslie.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.517
- Stop!
- [Grunts]

13:39.551 --> 13:42.119
[Crowd gasps]

13:43.689 --> 13:45.556
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.158
Just wheel out the backup cake.

13:47.192 --> 13:49.193
There is no backup cake.

13:49.228 --> 13:51.629
Who doesn't bake a backup cake?

13:51.663 --> 13:53.498
Okay, well that seals it.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.801
Even Leslie is crazier
than we are.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.740
They're still gonna serve
that cake, right?

14:01.118 --> 14:04.698
And then I said, uh, you might
want to check with the penguin.

14:04.818 --> 14:06.623
[Laughter]

14:06.943 --> 14:07.876
I get it.

14:07.911 --> 14:10.412
You Gryzzl guys are a real hoot.

14:10.447 --> 14:13.539
- And you have so much money.
- Thanks, Jessie.

14:13.659 --> 14:16.627
And, hey, enjoy that new
prototype Gryzzl tablet, huh?

14:16.662 --> 14:17.962
I will.
I just love it.

14:17.996 --> 14:20.565
Tablet: Thank you, Jessica.
I love you too.

14:20.599 --> 14:22.900
I love your skin.
Give me your skin.

14:22.935 --> 14:24.235
Oh.

14:24.269 --> 14:25.736
There's still a couple bugs
with the A.I. software.

14:25.771 --> 14:29.073
But, uh, maybe just turn it off
before you go to sleep.

14:29.107 --> 14:30.208
All right, Donna.
Let's hit it.

14:30.242 --> 14:31.742
- About to get some peddies.
- Okay.

14:31.777 --> 14:33.478
Peddies on peddies on peddies.

14:33.512 --> 14:35.479
Okay.
You're next.

14:38.250 --> 14:39.584
Hello, Ron.

14:39.618 --> 14:41.185
I just want you to know
that I am not sorry

14:41.220 --> 14:42.854
that I pushed you into
a giant cake.

14:42.888 --> 14:46.657
Well, I am sorry.
That I attended a public event.

14:46.692 --> 14:48.426
Yo, Ron?
Come on, bud.

14:48.460 --> 14:49.594
We're gonna go play some
video games

14:49.628 --> 14:52.263
and we want you
to watch quietly.

14:58.036 --> 15:00.004
[Sighs]

15:01.240 --> 15:03.274
After we drop off the renter's
insurance forms,

15:03.308 --> 15:04.809
we need to stop by
the grocery store.

15:04.843 --> 15:06.511
And then we need to sign
a suicide pact,

15:06.545 --> 15:07.812
because our lives
are meaningless.

15:07.846 --> 15:10.081
Babe, we are not boring people.

15:10.115 --> 15:12.350
Would boring people get
renter's insurance,

15:12.384 --> 15:14.118
even though it's not
legally required?

15:14.153 --> 15:15.253
Where are we?

15:15.287 --> 15:17.655
I have never once been to this
part of Pawnee.

15:17.689 --> 15:20.024
It's the creepy warehouse
district.

15:20.059 --> 15:23.327
It's mostly just raccoons
and old car batteries.

15:23.362 --> 15:25.396
Whoa, hang on.
Pull over.

15:25.431 --> 15:26.497
Look at that.

15:31.470 --> 15:34.739
- This place is amazing.
- Let's go in.

15:36.608 --> 15:38.776
[Knock on door]
What up, playa?

15:38.811 --> 15:41.312
Just wanted to apologize
for my intro running long.

15:41.346 --> 15:42.547
But, uh, you know.

15:42.581 --> 15:44.115
When it comes to inspirational
Will Smith quotes,

15:44.149 --> 15:45.383
how are you gonna stop at ten?

15:45.417 --> 15:46.751
You know, when the chamber
of commerce asked you

15:46.785 --> 15:49.187
to introduce me, I was a little
worried you would spend

15:49.221 --> 15:51.823
the entire time talking about
yourself,

15:51.857 --> 15:54.659
which is exactly what you did.

15:54.693 --> 15:56.527
I'm sorry.

15:56.562 --> 15:59.330
Truth is, they didn't ask me
to introduce you.

15:59.364 --> 16:00.565
I asked them if I could do it.

16:00.599 --> 16:04.068
I was gonna talk about how I owe
you so much.

16:04.103 --> 16:07.038
How you stood by me through all
my failures and I stood by you

16:07.072 --> 16:08.506
through all your terrible
outfits.

16:08.540 --> 16:11.409
But when I got up there,
I got pretty emotional.

16:11.443 --> 16:16.180
To make it up to you, I'd like
to read you the speech now.

16:16.215 --> 16:18.349
I've known a lot of ballers
in my day.

16:18.383 --> 16:21.919
But no man balls harder than
the man I'm about to bring up.

16:21.954 --> 16:25.256
He's kind, he's intelligent.
[Sobs]

16:25.290 --> 16:28.693
He's a person I'm deeply proud
to call my friend.

16:28.727 --> 16:32.463
Pretty good speech.
I mean, it was, um...

16:32.498 --> 16:35.433
a little sappy, maybe.

16:35.467 --> 16:36.400
[Sobs]

16:36.435 --> 16:39.370
I think I liked it.

16:39.405 --> 16:44.342
[Sobbing]

16:45.744 --> 16:47.578
Jessica, Mr. Nelson.

16:47.613 --> 16:49.747
You are going to hear
a lot of bids today.

16:49.782 --> 16:54.419
But this is the only one
that matters.

16:54.453 --> 16:56.654
Is this a circle?

16:56.688 --> 16:59.257
Or, is it an "O"?

16:59.291 --> 17:00.425
[Gasps]

17:00.459 --> 17:02.560
Is Oprah involved in your bid?

17:02.594 --> 17:04.262
It's a zero.

17:04.296 --> 17:06.329
I bid zero dollars.

17:06.365 --> 17:08.965
I have to say, that's one of
the lower one's we've seen.

17:09.001 --> 17:11.803
Pawnee is celebrating its
200th anniversary,

17:11.837 --> 17:14.372
and the Newport family has been
here since day one.

17:14.406 --> 17:17.508
Through feast and famine,
transformation, upheaval,

17:17.542 --> 17:19.176
celebration.

17:19.211 --> 17:21.878
The Newport family is part of
the fabric of this town,

17:21.914 --> 17:23.513
and not always in a good way.

17:23.549 --> 17:25.683
Like when your hot fudge
pipeline exploded.

17:25.718 --> 17:27.685
Oh, boo hoo.
It all ran off into the lake.

17:27.720 --> 17:28.820
Well, yes.

17:28.854 --> 17:31.022
Admittedly, it did make the fish
taste delicious,

17:31.056 --> 17:32.423
but it was a P.R. nightmare.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.125
My question is this.

17:34.159 --> 17:37.562
What do you want the Newport
name to mean in the future?

17:37.596 --> 17:40.331
If you donate this land
and you let me turn it

17:40.365 --> 17:42.733
into a national park--

17:42.768 --> 17:45.837
the Newport National Park--

17:45.871 --> 17:49.107
your name will stand
for something good.

17:49.141 --> 17:51.375
For generations to come.

17:51.410 --> 17:56.247
- How much was her bid again?
- It was, uh...zero dollars.

17:56.281 --> 17:58.216
Oh.
That's the part I don't like.

17:58.250 --> 18:01.285
Just keep me in the running.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.288
Give me a chance to prove
to you how great this could be.

18:06.825 --> 18:10.962
Says here there are 12
closets, three bomb shelters,

18:10.996 --> 18:13.998
five dumb waiters,
two and three eights baths.

18:14.032 --> 18:15.299
No kitchens.

18:15.334 --> 18:16.801
It's a fairly standard layout.

18:16.835 --> 18:18.803
Cool, is that a staircase
to nowhere?

18:18.837 --> 18:20.705
Yes, it is.
Good eye.

18:20.739 --> 18:22.240
What was this place?

18:22.274 --> 18:24.742
Remember the Pawnee doll head
factory?

18:24.777 --> 18:26.577
- This was a doll head factory?
- No.

18:26.612 --> 18:29.380
This was a holding cell
for people who went insane

18:29.415 --> 18:32.383
on the assembly line.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.218
What's behind this door?

18:34.253 --> 18:35.653
[Gasps]

18:35.687 --> 18:36.754
Fire poll.

18:36.789 --> 18:38.823
So this place has had
zero offers?

18:38.857 --> 18:41.359
People seem to be scared off

18:41.393 --> 18:45.096
on account of it being
haunted...

18:45.130 --> 18:46.698
and disgusting.

18:46.732 --> 18:50.535
After 47 years living here,
I decided to move

18:50.569 --> 18:53.805
to Orlando to be closer
to Disney World.

18:54.807 --> 18:57.141
We are responsible adults.

18:57.176 --> 18:58.616
- You know what that means.
- I know.

18:58.644 --> 19:02.046
We have money and we are going
to buy the shit

19:02.080 --> 19:03.247
out of this house.

19:03.282 --> 19:04.649
- Seriously?
- Yes.

19:04.683 --> 19:08.286
Who needs rental insurance?
We're gonna live here.

19:16.317 --> 19:18.221
We now go live to the press
conference.

19:18.341 --> 19:19.575
Good evening.

19:19.609 --> 19:21.010
I'm attorney Trevor Nelson
with the law firm

19:21.044 --> 19:22.544
Fwar, Dips, Winshares,
Gritt, Babip,

19:22.579 --> 19:23.879
Pecota, Vorp, and Eckstein.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.015
Legal counsel to the Newport
family.

19:26.335 --> 19:28.202
Here to announce that the
Newport family trust

19:28.237 --> 19:30.805
has narrowed the search
to two final candidates.

19:30.839 --> 19:34.142
The Gryzzl Corporation
and the National Park Service.

19:34.176 --> 19:36.644
Okay.
I'm in the game.

19:36.679 --> 19:39.847
All I have to do is convince
them that it's better taking

19:39.882 --> 19:42.350
no money than taking
$90 million.

19:42.384 --> 19:44.953
Well, you did convince three
unsuspecting toddlers

19:44.987 --> 19:47.489
that peas turn into cupcakes
in their tummies.

19:47.523 --> 19:51.626
I started my career in Pawnee
by turning a pit

19:51.660 --> 19:53.461
into a cool, little park.

19:53.495 --> 19:57.498
And now, I have the chance
to give this town a massive,

19:57.533 --> 20:00.034
beautiful gift
that they can use forever.

20:00.069 --> 20:02.971
In the words of Jason Bourne,
"This is where it started

20:03.005 --> 20:05.340
for me, this is where it ends."

20:05.374 --> 20:07.442
Yeah, you know,
I still think Kevin James

20:07.476 --> 20:09.410
was a weird choice
for the reboot.

20:09.445 --> 20:12.747
Oh, I don't.
I think he nailed it.

20:12.781 --> 20:15.149
So I'm thinking in addition
to the Tom's Bistros,

20:15.184 --> 20:18.553
we have a hyper exclusive lounge
area called Tommy's Lounge.

20:18.587 --> 20:20.855
Attention!
This is war.

20:20.889 --> 20:24.659
You guys are going down.
And that's all I wanted to say.

20:24.693 --> 20:26.461
Except Donna, Tom.
Hey.

20:26.495 --> 20:28.730
I'm--I'm sorry I haven't kept in
better touch with you recently.

20:28.764 --> 20:31.684
But I've just, you know, I'm a
little preoccupied with my kids and my job.

20:32.906 --> 20:34.999
And also, prepare for war.

20:35.178 --> 20:38.380
Because you chose the wrong side
and we are gonna smoke you.

20:38.415 --> 20:39.915
And also, I made cookies.

20:39.950 --> 20:42.118
But Ron is not allowed
to eat them.

20:42.152 --> 20:45.387
And they say prepare for war
on them.

20:45.422 --> 20:48.624
But the "O" in the word for
is a heart.

20:48.658 --> 20:50.659
And...

20:50.694 --> 20:53.095
I ate a lot of them on the way
over here,

20:53.130 --> 20:54.997
because we're at war.

20:55.031 --> 20:56.599
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, man.

20:56.633 --> 20:58.313
- Buddy, good to see you.
- How's it going?

20:58.335 --> 21:00.035
- It's pretty good.
- Hey, Andy!

21:00.070 --> 21:01.704
Let's go.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.506
War.

21:04.092 --> 21:08.234
