WEBVTT

00:01.329 --> 00:02.527
Previously on
The Practice...

00:02.527 --> 00:05.171
You know, Lindsay,
about a month or so ago

00:05.171 --> 00:07.073
we exchanged a kiss,
and we never even
talked about it.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.775
Should we talk about it?

00:08.809 --> 00:10.811
Not right now, no.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.979
Did you murder your sister
and frame George Vogelman?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.347
-Objection!
-What?!

00:14.380 --> 00:15.882
Did you
follow her to the bar,
then go to the motel?

00:15.916 --> 00:16.850
That's sick!

00:16.883 --> 00:19.385
You asked us
to trust you.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.722
-Aah!
-Uhh!

00:21.755 --> 00:23.256
Uhh!

00:23.289 --> 00:26.159
You just stole
my son's innocence.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.629
I represent Steve Robin
and his dad.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.030
BOBBY: Steve Robin?

00:30.063 --> 00:31.464
Brother of the victim
in your Vogelman trial.

00:31.497 --> 00:33.499
Eugene accused him
of being the killer.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.935
We're suing you.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.169
My client's wealthy.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.971
It's not about money.

00:38.004 --> 00:40.140
He wants you guys
out of business.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.942
-I want to fight.
-So do I.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.711
Okay. Jimmy,
you'll first chair.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.146
-What?
-What?

00:46.179 --> 00:47.848
Look, no offense, Jimmy,
but shouldn't you
be doing it?

00:47.881 --> 00:48.815
I mean, he's good,
I mean--

00:48.849 --> 00:49.983
you're great,

00:50.016 --> 00:51.618
-But we need our--
-Best.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.620
Jimmy will first chair.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.255
I'll second.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.733
Lucy, who authorized
a Christmas party?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.168
Oh, that'd be me.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.870
That would be you?
And are you
paying for it?

01:09.903 --> 01:10.871
Funny.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.205
Lucy.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.007
Oh, come on, Ellenor.
You look like
a party girl.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.175
Lindsay, Bobby,
and Eugene

01:15.208 --> 01:16.910
act like they've
never been to one.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.244
What?

01:18.278 --> 01:19.880
Did you know we were having
an office Christmas party?

01:19.913 --> 01:22.082
Oh, come on.
It's not like we have
to invite any clients.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.249
They're all in jail.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.185
Can I turn in
my partnership
for her job?

01:25.218 --> 01:27.420
It looks like more fun
being the boss.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.923
Okay, we set?

01:29.956 --> 01:31.157
Bags are packed.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.425
Have you
packed yours?

01:32.458 --> 01:35.195
Okay. Eugene, Ellenor,
we went through this.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.197
I'll say it
one more time.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.966
You don't defend
what you did
to the brother.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.535
You just describe it
as a necessary evil.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.436
Nobody's righteous,
nobody's arrogant,

01:43.469 --> 01:45.806
nobody's looking like
it's this big inconvenience

01:45.839 --> 01:46.907
getting sued, either.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.610
We know what
we did to the kid.
Our hearts go out.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.077
-We all clear?
-Yep.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.179
Nobody says that word
"qualified immunity."

01:53.213 --> 01:55.782
We're not relying
on legal jingles.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.584
One last thing.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.254
I know none of you
are crazy about me
being first chair.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.990
But nobody ever,
ever whispers

02:04.024 --> 02:05.892
or makes faces
or does anything

02:05.926 --> 02:07.761
to make the jury think
you doubt me.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.964
Like you all say,
my credibility
has to count in the end.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.498
Don't hurt it.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.501
Okay?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.570
Let's go.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.240
(sighs)

02:20.273 --> 02:22.676
That man is nervous--
big time.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.355
(telephone rings)

02:42.796 --> 02:44.565
(cell door closes, locks)

02:50.270 --> 02:53.540
(sirens wail)

03:10.536 --> 03:12.069
EUGENE: What you got
against parties?

03:12.069 --> 03:13.293
I don't have anything
against parties.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.460
I'd like you
to wear this.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.261
Excuse me?

03:15.295 --> 03:16.897
You look like
a hit man.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.031
I am not wearing this.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.132
Ready?

03:19.165 --> 03:20.366
No. He's not telling me
how to dress.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.935
They'll be painting you
as an assassin in there.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.036
Sky baby blue.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.805
He looks mean
in that tie.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.172
I look what?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.408
Jimmy, I understand
your thinking on this,
but he looks okay.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.410
Straight might be nice.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.914
Crooked works for you.

03:36.082 --> 03:38.418
It was a mistake
I even let him in.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.887
He's defending the man
who killed my daughter.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.224
I invite him into
my own kitchen.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.425
Why'd you do that?

03:45.458 --> 03:47.493
Because he impressed me
as being honest.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.230
So both me and my son
talked to him.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.565
Steve told him how...

03:51.598 --> 03:53.399
Susan sometimes would
get on the Internet,

03:53.433 --> 03:55.836
and he asked Steve if
he'd say that in court.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.137
And he agreed?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.438
He struck us
as a decent guy

03:58.471 --> 04:00.040
trying to do his job.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.877
And Steve figured
he wouldn't be going
against the prosecution.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.648
And what happened when
your son took the stand,
Mr. Robin?

04:08.815 --> 04:11.785
He accused my son
of killing his sister.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.721
He started screaming
in court, "You did it,
you did it."

04:14.755 --> 04:18.825
Accused him of cutting
off his own sister's head.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.861
(crowd gasping)

04:20.894 --> 04:22.663
Do you need a second?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.064
I'm okay.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.067
Actually, you're not okay,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.069
are you, Mr. Robin?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.804
You're dying.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.172
I have liver cancer.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.874
Did you tell
Mr. Young that?

04:33.907 --> 04:34.741
Yes.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.310
In the kitchen
he was asking if...

04:37.343 --> 04:39.780
Susan could have
been depressed
about anything.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.581
I...

04:40.614 --> 04:42.683
I told him
of my condition.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.685
And how did Mr. Young
make use of that?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.587
He said that
because I was dying,

04:46.620 --> 04:49.389
leaving my estate
to Susan and Steve,

04:49.422 --> 04:51.858
Steve had a motive
to kill Susan quick,

04:51.892 --> 04:53.359
before the cancer
got <i>me.</i>

04:53.393 --> 04:55.195
SILVA: How do you feel
about that statement?

04:55.228 --> 04:58.364
I don't think I have
to tell you how I feel
about that statement.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.000
I guess you don't.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.611
(clears throat)

05:14.380 --> 05:16.517
First, please know
how sorry I am

05:16.550 --> 05:18.084
about your daughter.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.986
Also about your illness.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.855
When Mr. Young talked to you

05:21.888 --> 05:22.889
that day in the kitchen,

05:22.923 --> 05:25.526
he believed somebody other
than George Vogelman

05:25.559 --> 05:27.027
killed Susan, right?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.095
I don't know
what he thought.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.932
Well, one of the reasons
you agreed to speak with him

05:31.965 --> 05:33.800
is 'cause you could tell

05:33.834 --> 05:36.469
he really did believe
in Mr. Vogelman's innocence.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.538
Would that be fair?

05:37.571 --> 05:38.539
It wouldn't be fair
to say

05:38.572 --> 05:41.608
my take on Mr. Young
was accurate.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.411
I have nothing else.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.617
Um...

05:50.651 --> 05:52.919
what Mr. Young
did to your son in court--

05:52.953 --> 05:55.088
I apologize for that.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.358
I apologize for my firm.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.761
That never should have
happened.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.577
Why don't you
just cut the check?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.645
The jury had to hear that.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.080
Not like that,
they didn't.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.749
You could say, "I sympathize,
I feel for you, I understand,"

06:22.783 --> 06:24.484
but saying what I did
was wrong--

06:24.518 --> 06:26.119
Jimmy, that's the whole issue,
in case you missed that.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.353
-I didn't miss it.
-All right.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.622
If that's our defense,
what do you plan--

06:28.655 --> 06:30.023
I told you going in
this would not--

06:30.056 --> 06:31.825
it is one thing
to turtle, it is
another to confess.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.727
EUGENE:
I gotta go before the bar.
You think about that?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.596
It's not just money with me.
My job is on the line,

06:35.629 --> 06:38.164
and you go on record
announcing I was wrong?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.667
I didn't do that.
I said it shouldn't
have happened.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.468
-What's the difference
in how you say it?
-That's enough.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.771
You're damn right
it's enough!
Enough to lose the case.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.406
Eugene.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.110
Showing compassion
is one thing.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.113
We cannot admit
liability.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.850
I didn't do that.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.290
I--I apologize
for being bossy

07:04.324 --> 07:06.993
and overstepping myself.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.029
I don't really mean to.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.631
Okay.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.001
You know,
it wasn't totally easy

07:15.035 --> 07:18.304
coming in here to such
a tight group where
everybody was friends.

07:18.338 --> 07:22.876
It's not that I expected
to be welcomed, but...

07:22.909 --> 07:27.280
that remark about
me packing my bags...

07:27.313 --> 07:29.482
I didn't deserve that.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.417
You're right.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.019
I'm sorry.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.859
I know that the holidays
are hard on people
who don't have anybody.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.426
I could fix you up.
I know some cool guys.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.462
Did I do something
wrong again?

07:42.495 --> 07:44.164
Go sit down.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.100
Suddenly,
right there in court,

07:47.133 --> 07:49.102
he starts accusing me,

07:49.135 --> 07:51.538
saying I killed her.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.107
I felt just... shock.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.610
And what about
after the trial?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.378
It doesn't go away.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.747
First, he duped me.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.283
I feel like
I played a part
in freeing the man

08:03.316 --> 08:04.417
who killed
my sister.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.919
Objection. Assuming facts
not in evidence.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.021
George Vogelman
did not kill Susan Robin.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.156
SILVA: Move to strike.
That remark assumes facts
not in evidence,

08:10.190 --> 08:12.859
much less existence.
All the facts go to show
that he did kill her.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.561
Objection.
Now who's accusing who?

08:14.595 --> 08:15.996
A jury already
found George Vogelman--

08:16.029 --> 08:17.664
Is it your turn
to accuse this boy
of killing his sister?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.934
Please. The jury
has already been informed
of Mr. Vogelman's acquittal,

08:20.967 --> 08:24.037
as well as its irrelevance
to this proceeding.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.772
Mr. Silva, continue.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.975
You said, Steve,

08:29.009 --> 08:30.276
it doesn't go away.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.778
People--

08:31.812 --> 08:35.215
I can see
in their eyes...

08:35.248 --> 08:36.448
"Did he?"

08:36.482 --> 08:38.183
"Could he have?"

08:38.217 --> 08:39.586
You know what
that feels like,

08:39.620 --> 08:41.688
to walk around
with people thinking

08:41.722 --> 08:44.457
maybe you decapitated
your sister?

08:44.490 --> 08:46.092
Please, don't address
the defendants, sir.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.829
"Always some truth
behind every rumor, huh?"

08:48.862 --> 08:51.064
"He can't disprove it,
can he?"

08:51.097 --> 08:53.166
"He had no alibi."

08:55.335 --> 08:57.571
It's never
gonna go away.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.474
You feel violated.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.943
I was violated.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.579
We can only imagine,
most of us,

09:05.612 --> 09:06.947
what it must feel like

09:06.980 --> 09:09.349
to be accused
of such a gruesome murder.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.752
Can you imagine
what it must feel like

09:11.785 --> 09:14.621
to be actually charged
with a crime
you didn't commit?

09:14.655 --> 09:17.157
I'm not sure
it could be any worse,
Mr. Berluti.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.491
Yeah, it can, Steve.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.661
'Cause it's not just
reputation on the line.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.962
It's your life.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.397
Forget whispers
from the public.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.299
You go to
a maximum security prison.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.300
He should.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.969
He killed my sister.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.071
What if he didn't?

09:31.104 --> 09:33.807
There he is, Steve.

09:36.977 --> 09:40.180
Assuming he's innocent, can you
think what it must feel like

09:40.213 --> 09:42.583
to be threatened with
life imprisonment?

09:42.616 --> 09:44.150
That's worse...

09:44.184 --> 09:46.052
Don't you agree?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.093
So he's doing well?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.361
On the son he did great.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.598
On the father...

09:57.631 --> 09:59.199
he wobbled a little.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.066
Who's next?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.268
The detective,
right after lunch.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.937
Well, good luck.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.006
To all of us.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.810
Bobby, um, uh,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.512
this Christmas party,
uh...

10:11.545 --> 10:13.179
We can invite clients?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.715
I guess.

10:14.748 --> 10:18.184
Uh, what about dates?
Are we supposed to bring dates?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.721
You know, you really
should check with Lucy.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.056
She knows more
what's going on.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.758
Okay.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.828
Do...you have a date?

10:27.861 --> 10:31.097
Uh--well, no, I
haven't...asked anyone.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.899
I--I was just wondering.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.169
Are you bringing anyone?

10:36.202 --> 10:37.871
No.

10:37.904 --> 10:38.939
Um...

10:42.776 --> 10:44.878
I'm up next
with the detective,

10:44.911 --> 10:46.580
so I should
really be--

10:46.613 --> 10:48.114
Oh. Yeah.

11:00.995 --> 11:01.901
BERLUTI: You set?
Set.

11:01.901 --> 11:03.564
 I'm not going
kid gloves with
the detective, remember?

11:03.564 --> 11:05.599
I got no problem
going hard on witnesses.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.000
It's just the family--

11:07.033 --> 11:09.435
I want you to get
the detective.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.470
Okay.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.472
-What?
-What?

11:12.506 --> 11:14.007
I see you two looking.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.642
I wasn't looking
at anything.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.310
You were thinking.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.179
All right, Jimmy,
come on.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.716
I wasn't looking at him!

11:22.749 --> 11:24.718
What-- What--

11:25.652 --> 11:27.253
Did any evidence
even suggest

11:27.287 --> 11:30.323
that Steve Robin
could have been involved
in his sister's death?

11:30.356 --> 11:31.925
No, sir.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.493
Forensics?
DNA? Fingerprints?

11:33.527 --> 11:35.729
Everything pointed
to George Vogelman.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.297
Nothing indicated
Steve Robin.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.431
Now, Detective,

11:38.464 --> 11:40.166
the defense
has complained

11:40.200 --> 11:44.137
that you never even
bothered to investigate
Steve Robin.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.839
We considered
all family members.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.040
There was nothing
to incriminate him,

11:47.073 --> 11:49.743
nor anybody
but George Vogelman.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.477
Steve Robin
did have motive.

11:51.512 --> 11:53.279
Financial problems.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.648
He'd be the sole
beneficiary.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.650
That is motive,
right, Detective?

11:56.683 --> 11:57.784
Perhaps.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.385
And wasn't it
established

11:59.419 --> 12:00.353
that Steve Robin
and his sister

12:00.386 --> 12:02.155
were estranged
at the time
of her death?

12:02.188 --> 12:03.023
Yes.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.125
And who established
that, Detective,

12:05.158 --> 12:06.860
the police
or George Vogelman's
lawyers?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.028
You people did.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.096
And Steve Robin
had no real alibi

12:10.130 --> 12:11.598
at the time
of his sister's death?

12:11.632 --> 12:13.834
As far as I know,
neither do you.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.502
But without any evidence,
we can't--

12:15.536 --> 12:17.137
I was
as much a suspect

12:17.170 --> 12:20.073
as an estranged
family member
with a motive?

12:20.106 --> 12:22.809
No. My point is,
we need some evidence

12:22.843 --> 12:24.144
to trigger
at least suspicion

12:24.177 --> 12:25.679
before we investigate
anybody.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.047
There was none
on the brother.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.214
Did you
want there to be?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.650
Might have
hurt your case
against George.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.051
-Objection.
-Withdrawn.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.419
You never even
asked the question,
did you, Detective?

12:33.453 --> 12:36.156
You never even said,
hey, what about
the brother?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.625
Of course we did.
We ruled him out.

12:38.659 --> 12:39.926
Can you prove
he didn't do it?

12:39.960 --> 12:40.894
We can't prove it.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.328
Well, how do you
rule him out?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.564
Because all the evidence

12:43.597 --> 12:44.865
went to your client.

12:44.898 --> 12:45.966
All the evidence
collected.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.334
All the evidence, period.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.036
The murder weapon?

12:51.672 --> 12:53.039
The murder weapon,
Detective.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.340
We never found the weapon.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.577
The bloody clothing
worn by the killer?

12:56.610 --> 12:58.144
We didn't find
any bloody clothing.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.213
There likely was bloody
clothing. You just
didn't find it, right?

13:00.246 --> 13:01.047
Right.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.048
What about
the witnesses?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.183
There weren't
any witnesses.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.150
To your knowledge,

13:04.184 --> 13:05.786
or can you prove
there were no witnesses?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.588
To my knowledge.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.623
"All the evidence,
period."

13:09.656 --> 13:12.626
That means
all the evidence you had,

13:12.659 --> 13:13.694
right, Detective?

13:13.727 --> 13:15.328
Yes.

13:15.361 --> 13:16.162
Thank you.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.565
Oh, at one point,
you did say,

13:18.599 --> 13:19.766
what about
the brother?

13:19.800 --> 13:20.767
Of course we did.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.569
Did Tommy Silva sue you?

13:22.603 --> 13:24.404
SILVA: Objection.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.806
Withdrawn.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.144
I'm going to lead with you,
Ellenor, then Eugene.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.779
Different tie
tomorrow, right?

13:32.813 --> 13:34.114
Ellenor,

13:34.147 --> 13:35.816
expect Silva
to cross you personally.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.917
What do you mean?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.685
You dated George.
He'll try to use that.

13:38.719 --> 13:40.086
That's not relevant.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.487
Your judgment during
trial is relevant.

13:41.522 --> 13:43.690
He'll try to show that
you were clouded
by your--

13:43.724 --> 13:45.091
Let's bring a motion
in limine.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.693
Too late.
You're on at 4:00.

13:46.727 --> 13:48.028
Continue until tomorrow.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.663
We'll look worse
trying to evade.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.264
Let's just be up front
about everything.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.667
You know,
that's easy for you to say.
It's not your personal life.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.168
Who's got
a personal life?

13:55.201 --> 13:56.302
ALL: Lucy!

13:56.336 --> 13:57.738
Hey!

13:57.771 --> 13:59.606
Bite it right off.

13:59.640 --> 14:00.774
I quit.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.275
See ya.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.416
Look, I've tried
to fit in,

14:10.450 --> 14:13.419
and I realize it's probably
my fault that I don't,

14:13.453 --> 14:15.321
but let's just all admit
it's not working!

14:15.355 --> 14:17.257
I won't admit that.
I think you've
been doing great.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.059
You're the only one
who's been nice.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.361
And Jimmy.
Sometimes Rebecca,

14:21.394 --> 14:23.964
and Ellenor,
when she's not riled.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.599
Lucy, we all snipe
at each other.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.101
The fact that they
dish it out to you
like everybody else,

14:28.134 --> 14:29.536
that's just a sign
of being accepted.

14:29.570 --> 14:31.972
I think maybe we just
assume you can take it

14:32.005 --> 14:33.339
because you're so--

14:33.373 --> 14:34.474
I'm not that tough.

14:34.508 --> 14:36.176
I'm just pushy.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.544
A little.

14:37.578 --> 14:39.079
Why do you think
that is?

14:39.112 --> 14:42.282
I'm just used
to taking care of people.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.449
And you guys,

14:43.483 --> 14:47.187
sometimes you seem
like you need it a little.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.289
We do.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.125
You're working out,
I promise.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.530
It wasn't that
we thought Steve Robin
killed his sister

14:56.563 --> 14:59.533
so much as we couldn't
exclude the possibility.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.734
Let's be honest.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.202
Steve Robin was a bit
of a red herring.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.005
Yes, which is viable
because the police
didn't investigate.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.440
Detective McKrew
claims they did.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.843
George Vogelman did not
kill Susan Robin.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.679
George Vogelman passed
a lie detector test
that we gave him.

15:12.713 --> 15:13.947
District Attorney
Helen Gamble--

15:13.980 --> 15:15.582
SILVA:
Objection. Hearsay.

15:15.616 --> 15:18.284
Not offered for the truth,
but only as to what
the witness heard.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.086
I'll allow it.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.524
What did District Attorney
Helen Gamble tell you?

15:23.557 --> 15:26.693
Basically that the police
had a disincentive
to investigate.

15:26.727 --> 15:29.429
The victim's head was found
in George Vogelman's
medical bag.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.566
He represented
the only chance they had
at getting a conviction.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.968
They desperately needed
to satisfy public pressure,

15:35.001 --> 15:37.971
and any new evidence
would only serve
to undermine

15:38.004 --> 15:39.973
what they believed
was an open and shut case.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.876
Leaving you
with the idea...

15:42.909 --> 15:44.878
They were more concerned
with getting a conviction

15:44.911 --> 15:46.813
than they were with finding
the real killer.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.348
Helen Gamble
told you this?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.183
She suggested to me
that could've been why

15:50.216 --> 15:51.618
the police
didn't reopen.

15:51.652 --> 15:53.019
Told you this
in confidence?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.454
Pretty much.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.157
And you
sprung a little surprise,
calling her to the stand,

15:57.190 --> 15:59.192
making her say that
under oath.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.727
She didn't see that
coming, did she?

16:00.761 --> 16:01.728
No.

16:01.762 --> 16:02.729
You basically
sandbagged her.

16:02.763 --> 16:03.864
Objection.

16:03.897 --> 16:04.965
Withdrawn.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.933
What's Plan "B"?

16:06.967 --> 16:09.402
It's sort
of a slang code we have

16:09.435 --> 16:13.473
for, well, shifting
guilt to somebody
other than our client.

16:13.507 --> 16:16.743
It's pointing the finger
at someone else in court,

16:16.777 --> 16:18.411
saying he did it.
Is that it?

16:18.444 --> 16:19.546
Basically.

16:19.580 --> 16:22.649
And basically you decided
to Plan "B" Steve Robin

16:22.683 --> 16:24.585
in the Vogelman trial.

16:24.618 --> 16:25.619
Yes.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.087
Stand up in open court

16:27.120 --> 16:30.524
and suddenly say
he killed his own sister.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.293
-Asked and answered.
-Let's move on, Counselor.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.229
When you decided
to Plan "B" Steve Robin,

16:36.262 --> 16:38.765
did you think
he killed his sister?

16:38.799 --> 16:40.200
We didn't know.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.803
Oh, I understand you couldn't
know for positively sure.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.105
My question goes
to what you thought.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.507
Honest answer.

16:46.540 --> 16:49.710
Did you really think
he killed his sister?

16:49.743 --> 16:51.377
No.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.314
You'll do anything to get
the client off, won't you?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.816
-JIMMY: Objection!
-JUDGE: Sustained.

16:55.849 --> 17:00.220
You ever been
suspended in connection
with jury tampering?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.161
That was
an innocuous exchange

17:08.194 --> 17:09.730
that happened
in an elevator

17:09.762 --> 17:11.164
between a colleague
and a juror,

17:11.196 --> 17:12.799
who tried to ask her
out on a date.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.167
You're required by law
to report these
communications

17:15.201 --> 17:16.603
to the judge,
aren't you?

17:16.637 --> 17:17.871
Objection. Relevance!

17:17.904 --> 17:20.006
Offered to show
a pattern of deceit.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.008
It also bears
on the witness' honesty,

17:22.041 --> 17:24.077
which she puts in issue
by testifying.

17:24.109 --> 17:26.747
I'll allow it.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.315
Want a cup of water,
Ms. Frutt?

17:29.349 --> 17:31.317
I'm fine.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.653
Thank you.

17:32.686 --> 17:34.788
Did you persuade
your colleague

17:34.821 --> 17:36.189
not to report
the jury tampering

17:36.222 --> 17:37.858
because it might cost
your client an acquittal?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.159
Yes.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.694
-Client there
was an alleged drug dealer?
-Yes.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.996
Couple of months ago,
you had another client,
a drunk driver.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.398
He hit a pedestrian,
called you from the scene.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.001
You advise him to drink
right there on the spot?

17:48.034 --> 17:49.335
-Objection!
-Pattern.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.136
Go ahead.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.371
You tell this client,

17:51.404 --> 17:53.273
"Let yourself
be seen drinking

17:53.306 --> 17:55.308
so that when you fail
the breathalyzer,

17:55.341 --> 17:57.944
you can say you were
drinking after the accident?"

17:57.978 --> 17:59.312
Your Honor, this is getting
way off track!

17:59.345 --> 18:00.747
I agree.
Let's move on.

18:00.781 --> 18:02.883
Is there anything you won't
stoop to, Ms. Frutt?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.317
-Objection!
-Sustained!

18:04.350 --> 18:06.419
You consider yourself
an honest person?

18:06.452 --> 18:07.988
-Objection!
-Sustained.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.422
You don't want her
to answer that?

18:09.455 --> 18:11.257
You'd think that'd be
kind of a slow ball.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.359
-Objection!
-Sustained.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.031
Where the hell
were you?

18:18.064 --> 18:19.432
I was up and down
like a jack-in-the-box.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.267
You came in late,
and where were you?!

18:21.301 --> 18:23.570
Ellenor, Jimmy's right.
If we ducked those questions--

18:23.604 --> 18:25.105
Those questions
have nothing to do
with this case--

18:25.138 --> 18:27.173
-They had to do with you!
-If we look like
we're hiding anything--

18:27.207 --> 18:28.575
You hung me out!

18:28.609 --> 18:31.845
BOBBY: Silva hung you out
with your own history.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.881
Jimmy did nothing wrong.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.022
HELEN:
You should've
settled this.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.389
LINDSAY:
Tell me about it.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.391
Lindsay, if they come back
over the policy,

18:45.425 --> 18:48.028
it's going to be Donnell,
Young, Dole and "Shut."

18:48.061 --> 18:49.129
I know.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.764
Aren't you scared?

18:50.797 --> 18:51.932
Yes.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.500
I've been thinking
about leaving anyway

18:54.535 --> 18:55.468
a little.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.537
Excuse me?

18:56.570 --> 18:57.671
A little.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.507
You know, maybe
to a bigger firm.
I don't know.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.810
You're in love
with him.

19:03.844 --> 19:04.978
What?!

19:05.011 --> 19:06.012
Who?

19:06.046 --> 19:07.480
What are you afraid of?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.049
Because you two
work together?

19:09.082 --> 19:10.416
-If it's right, it's--
-It isn't right,

19:10.450 --> 19:11.718
and I know where
it would end.

19:11.752 --> 19:12.786
I don't want
to end up like--

19:12.819 --> 19:14.655
-Like what?
-He's a workaholic,
for one thing.

19:14.688 --> 19:17.057
What's another thing?
Are you waiting for him
to totally get over me?

19:17.090 --> 19:19.459
'Cause it just
doesn't happen.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.895
Let's just
decorate the tree.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.765
Sure.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.801
You're an idiot.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.770
Decorate.

19:45.386 --> 19:46.481
Look, obviously Silva has moles.

19:46.481 --> 19:49.529
He heard about Plan "B,"
Ellenor advising a client
to drink.

19:49.529 --> 19:50.724
The jury tampering thing
was on record,

19:50.757 --> 19:53.093
but what happened
with Helen Gamble?
That wasn't.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.728
The guy is tapped in.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.730
Tapped in or not,
this doesn't happen

19:56.763 --> 19:58.899
unless people in this room
are talking.

20:01.001 --> 20:02.669
I didn't tell!

20:02.703 --> 20:03.970
Nobody's saying you did.

20:04.004 --> 20:05.338
No, not much.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.508
The point is,
we can't repeat stuff,
not to friends,

20:07.541 --> 20:11.177
relatives, anybody,
because Tommy Silva
knows everybody.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.846
Everybody.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.548
Eugene, you ready?

20:14.581 --> 20:15.448
All set.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.183
I don't plan to be
protecting you,

20:17.217 --> 20:18.585
just like
with Ellenor.

20:18.619 --> 20:19.886
Great.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.921
Come on. Let's go.

20:21.922 --> 20:23.256
Hold on!

20:24.324 --> 20:26.326
You all got your tails
between your legs.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.295
I think Silva
is making a mistake here,

20:29.329 --> 20:31.297
the more of this
outside stuff he puts in.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.734
The jury tampering,
the drunk client.

20:33.767 --> 20:37.303
He's trying to win
with evidence that's
got nothing to with this case.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.072
The jury can see that,

20:39.105 --> 20:43.109
so let's not
go in the room
looking like losers, okay?

20:43.143 --> 20:45.278
The jury can see that, too.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.750
EUGENE:
When I persuaded
Steve Robin to testify,

20:49.783 --> 20:53.319
my intent was only
to establish his sister
being on the Internet.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.321
I never lied to him.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.523
MICHAEL:
But let's be fair.

20:56.557 --> 20:58.124
When you changed
your strategy,

20:58.158 --> 21:01.562
you didn't call him up
and say, "By the way,
I plan to accuse you."

21:01.595 --> 21:02.596
No.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.798
You wanted
to spring this.

21:04.831 --> 21:05.832
Yes.

21:05.866 --> 21:06.900
Why?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.101
By surprising him,

21:08.134 --> 21:10.837
I had a better chance
of causing him
to be outraged.

21:10.871 --> 21:13.574
Rage and outrage,
they can look alike.

21:13.607 --> 21:16.943
If I could get a jury
to see rage in him,

21:16.977 --> 21:19.412
they could more easily
believe he could've
committed a homicide.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.715
Do you believe
he killed his sister?

21:21.748 --> 21:23.750
I didn't know
that he didn't,

21:23.784 --> 21:26.587
but I really didn't
think that he did, either.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.722
So, Mr. Young,
you're basically admitting

21:28.755 --> 21:30.757
you accused Steve Robin
of doing something

21:30.791 --> 21:32.659
you yourself didn't
really think he did.

21:32.693 --> 21:35.929
I do not admit
that I'm guilty
of any wrongdoing.

21:35.962 --> 21:36.963
And why not?

21:36.997 --> 21:38.364
Because,
as a defense lawyer,

21:38.398 --> 21:39.700
it is my job
to raise questions,

21:39.733 --> 21:42.603
to play devil's advocate
to what the government
is saying.

21:42.636 --> 21:45.806
Sometimes you might look
like a devil doing so.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.544
Don't you feel bad?

21:50.577 --> 21:53.179
Steve Robin,
he's probably innocent.

21:53.213 --> 21:55.181
Of course, I feel bad,

21:55.215 --> 21:57.483
but George Vogelman
is innocent.

21:57.518 --> 21:59.886
He was framed, the police
didn't investigate,

21:59.920 --> 22:02.088
and I wasn't about
to let an innocent man

22:02.122 --> 22:05.726
get a life sentence
for something
he didn't do.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.729
SILVA:
You're facing possible
discipline from the bar

22:08.762 --> 22:12.098
because of this Plan "B"
tactic, aren't you?

22:12.132 --> 22:14.100
I was reported
to the bar,

22:14.134 --> 22:16.069
I suspect
at your urging.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.104
The bar is conducting
an inquiry?

22:18.138 --> 22:19.272
Yes.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.775
You sound--
maybe it's me--

22:21.808 --> 22:25.512
you sound almost proud
of what you did.

22:25.546 --> 22:26.913
EUGENE: Like I said,

22:26.947 --> 22:28.782
I didn't enjoy having
to attack Steve Robin,

22:28.815 --> 22:31.251
but once a defense
lawyer takes a case,

22:31.284 --> 22:34.521
he has to use whatever
legal means possible
to defend his client.

22:34.555 --> 22:36.189
That's what I did.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.924
In fact, Plan "B."

22:37.958 --> 22:40.694
You guys use
this strategy a lot,
don't you?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.262
EUGENE:
We use it on occasion,

22:42.295 --> 22:43.764
when we deem it viable.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.966
Last week, Bobby Donnell
had a case--

22:45.999 --> 22:46.967
Objection.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.101
Pattern, Your Honor.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.269
Go ahead.

22:49.302 --> 22:51.471
A baby was killed,

22:51.505 --> 22:54.407
and your firm represented
the convicted killer.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.409
Bobby Donnell
stood up in court

22:56.442 --> 22:58.111
and accused
the baby's father,

22:58.144 --> 22:59.145
didn't he?

22:59.179 --> 23:00.881
I wasn't there,
but to my knowledge,

23:00.914 --> 23:02.649
the facts supported
the question.

23:02.683 --> 23:05.619
And that, too, would be
a lawyer's job, right?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.220
Yes.

23:07.253 --> 23:08.722
In fact,
any grieving parent,

23:08.755 --> 23:10.724
should his baby be murdered,

23:10.757 --> 23:13.226
should expect to be accused
of killing his child,

23:13.259 --> 23:15.562
because that's our system.

23:15.596 --> 23:17.297
It's not that simple.

23:17.330 --> 23:19.700
Well, you're sure making it
sound that simple, Mr. Young.

23:19.733 --> 23:24.204
You're sitting in that chair,
and we're talking about
accusing family members

23:24.237 --> 23:26.206
of murdering
their loved ones

23:26.239 --> 23:28.008
as basic defense strategy.

23:28.041 --> 23:31.177
You sure make it
sound easy.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.414
That's all I got.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.952
JUDGE:
Mr. Berluti, redirect.

23:45.826 --> 23:47.761
Mr. Berluti?

23:47.794 --> 23:49.963
Yes, Your Honor.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.667
Going after Steve Robin
like that,

23:53.700 --> 23:56.703
you weren't a little
disgusted with yourself?

23:58.304 --> 24:00.674
As I testified,
I didn't enjoy doing it.

24:00.707 --> 24:01.942
That wasn't my question.

24:01.975 --> 24:04.410
I asked weren't you
disgusted with yourself.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.312
Didn't you go back
to the witness room
right after and say

24:06.346 --> 24:08.882
something to the effect,
like, you were a monster
for doing that?

24:08.915 --> 24:10.617
Isn't that what
you told Ellenor Frutt?

24:10.651 --> 24:12.586
What are you doing?

24:12.619 --> 24:14.454
Last year,
your 10-year-old son said,

24:14.487 --> 24:16.422
"My dad gets killers off."

24:16.456 --> 24:18.759
And you were disgusted
with yourself when you
heard that, weren't you?

24:18.792 --> 24:20.226
You wanted to quit
practicing law.

24:20.260 --> 24:21.728
What's going on?

24:21.762 --> 24:23.830
I'm asking the witness
some tough questions.

24:23.864 --> 24:25.599
If he doesn't answer,
I'd like to treat him
as hostile.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.133
This is just another stunt,
Your Honor--

24:27.167 --> 24:28.502
Why don't you sit down
till you know what
you're talking about?

24:28.535 --> 24:32.038
All right. I'll give you
some latitude, Counsel.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.343
You like putting killers
back out there, Eugene?

24:37.377 --> 24:40.213
Two years ago,
some pedophile you defended,

24:40.246 --> 24:41.548
you put him
back on the street.

24:41.582 --> 24:45.318
He sodomized and murdered
two little boys, didn't he?

24:45.351 --> 24:47.954
You snapped in court,
and you beat up your own
client, didn't you?

24:47.988 --> 24:49.590
If they hadn't
pulled you off him,

24:49.623 --> 24:51.925
who knows what would've
happened, right, Eugene?

24:51.958 --> 24:56.530
This spiel-- defense lawyers
do what we must
and we don't apologize--

24:56.563 --> 24:58.331
that's a bunch of crap,
isn't it?

24:58.364 --> 25:00.300
You get disgusted
with yourself a lot,

25:00.333 --> 25:04.370
and you got disgusted
with yourself after attacking
Steve Robin on the stand,

25:04.404 --> 25:05.471
didn't you?

25:05.506 --> 25:08.241
'Cause you knew then
like you know now,

25:08.274 --> 25:10.076
it was despicable.

25:11.111 --> 25:12.946
Isn't that the truth?

25:16.216 --> 25:21.522
We can take your silence
as a yes, can't we, Eugene?

25:39.573 --> 25:41.107
What the hell was that?!

25:41.141 --> 25:42.709
-All right.
-Eugene.

25:43.476 --> 25:45.111
You were up there
like a robot.

25:45.145 --> 25:46.479
You couldn't
have been worse.

25:46.513 --> 25:48.481
If we rested on that,
we'd lose big!

25:48.515 --> 25:50.316
You were terrible!

26:04.097 --> 26:05.799
How'd it go?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.300
Jimmy!

26:09.269 --> 26:10.671
(slam)

26:13.173 --> 26:14.775
(slam)

26:15.909 --> 26:18.078
I don't think
it went well.

26:18.111 --> 26:19.946
I'm not saying you're wrong.
He was a little cold,

26:19.980 --> 26:21.748
but exactly how did you
make it better?

26:21.782 --> 26:23.149
I let the jury know

26:23.183 --> 26:26.452
I had the same reaction
to his testimony
that they had.

26:26.486 --> 26:28.855
Bobby, he was
more than cold.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.860
I'll talk to him.

26:33.894 --> 26:36.062
You ready
with your closing?

26:36.096 --> 26:37.764
No.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.901
Everything okay?

26:40.934 --> 26:43.670
Eugene's testimony
went a little rough.

26:43.704 --> 26:45.305
We're finished,
aren't we?

26:46.807 --> 26:48.374
Had we started up again?

26:48.408 --> 26:52.078
I--this firm.
If we lose this case.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.780
Oh, we haven't lost,

26:53.814 --> 26:56.750
and even if we do,
there's a lot to appeal.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.752
We're not finished.

26:59.920 --> 27:00.887
Uh...

27:01.922 --> 27:02.956
What?

27:02.989 --> 27:05.058
That's all.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.595
Is it that bad?

27:08.629 --> 27:10.230
No, it's just--

27:10.263 --> 27:11.364
Tell me.

27:14.635 --> 27:15.902
I kissed Lucy.

27:15.936 --> 27:17.538
I should say
she kissed me,

27:17.571 --> 27:19.339
and when she did it,
it felt wrong,

27:19.372 --> 27:21.207
like I was
betraying somebody.

27:21.241 --> 27:22.743
Lindsay. Somewhere
in the back of my brain,

27:22.776 --> 27:24.745
I feel like
I'm in some kind
of relationship with her.

27:24.778 --> 27:27.881
My head went right to her
when Lucy kissed me.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.150
I was talking
about the Robin case.

27:30.183 --> 27:33.119
What? Oh, yeah.
It didn't go very well.
It wasn't good.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.521
You kissed Lucy.

27:34.555 --> 27:36.523
She kissed me.
Mistletoe, but, well--

27:36.557 --> 27:38.424
You kiss Helen Gamble,

27:38.458 --> 27:39.693
you kiss Lindsay.

27:39.726 --> 27:40.694
There was
that whiny thing
in the short skirt,

27:40.727 --> 27:42.395
and now you kiss Lucy.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.864
-(slap)
-What's wrong with you?

27:43.897 --> 27:44.798
Rebecca!

27:44.831 --> 27:46.332
You know we're about
to face bankruptcy,

27:46.366 --> 27:48.234
you're running around
kissing teenagers!
What's wrong with you?

27:48.268 --> 27:49.936
Rebecca, I tell you
something that's bothering me
and you swat me?

27:49.970 --> 27:52.172
You're damn right!
She's 18 years old!

27:52.205 --> 27:53.139
She kissed me!

27:53.173 --> 27:54.508
Oh! Why didn't you
tell the world?

27:54.541 --> 27:55.876
Lucy!

27:55.909 --> 27:57.443
You know,
it's bad enough that
she already hates me--

27:57.477 --> 27:59.145
I don't hate you!

27:59.179 --> 28:00.346
What is going on here?

28:00.380 --> 28:01.347
Has he kissed you, too?

28:01.381 --> 28:02.315
-What?
-Rebecca!

28:02.348 --> 28:04.384
Let's all get back to work!
Can we do that?

28:04.417 --> 28:06.319
Back...to...work!

28:11.391 --> 28:13.093
(door slams)

28:16.830 --> 28:18.431
(knocking lightly)

28:23.269 --> 28:26.139
I didn't plan
to take that approach.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.641
I felt it necessary,

28:27.674 --> 28:30.210
since I found your
testimony unsympathetic.

28:30.243 --> 28:32.813
Jimmy...

28:32.846 --> 28:35.281
close it on your way out.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.185
I would think
you'd understand.

28:39.219 --> 28:42.889
I was doing whatever
I could to save the client,

28:42.923 --> 28:45.759
and the client is you.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.431
(door closes)

28:59.441 --> 29:01.838
Put yourself
in their position.

29:01.838 --> 29:04.188
Our position.

29:10.647 --> 29:11.451
Every defendant--

29:13.119 --> 29:14.655
Did you stay here
all night?

29:14.688 --> 29:16.122
It's morning?

29:17.490 --> 29:20.393
Oh, gosh.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.162
LUCY: Oh, Jimmy.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.631
This does not look
like a good closing.

29:24.665 --> 29:26.166
Hello.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.401
George.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.804
Hi, Jimmy, Lucy.

29:30.837 --> 29:33.239
He's got a bag.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.608
What's up?

29:34.641 --> 29:37.110
I was thinking.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.646
I was the guy
you fought for.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.181
Maybe you should
put me up there.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.049
Get the jury to see it
from my side.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.151
JIMMY: I thought
about that,

29:45.185 --> 29:46.520
but Silva
would cross you
on the porno tapes.

29:46.553 --> 29:48.622
He--he'd get it in
how your friends
pulled away,

29:48.655 --> 29:50.423
how you still didn't
get your job back.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.626
You were an easy cross
in a criminal trial.

29:52.659 --> 29:54.294
You'd be even softer
here in a civil one.

29:54.327 --> 29:56.763
I just wish there was something
I could do to--

29:56.797 --> 29:58.732
Just be in the room.

29:58.765 --> 30:01.067
That'd be great.

30:01.101 --> 30:02.368
Sure.

30:07.207 --> 30:08.975
I'll see you.

30:10.744 --> 30:13.113
What was Bobby thinking,
giving it to me?

30:13.146 --> 30:15.516
From what I hear,
you're doing great.

30:15.549 --> 30:16.717
Who said?

30:16.750 --> 30:19.620
Well, uh... nobody.

30:19.653 --> 30:22.055
But I can feel
you're doing great.

30:25.626 --> 30:27.160
What?

30:27.193 --> 30:29.095
He left his bag.

30:36.537 --> 30:38.271
He's gone.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.474
Think he got lucky
last night?

30:41.508 --> 30:44.244
Lucy, he--he just
forgot it.

30:52.185 --> 30:54.487
Are you out
of your mind?

30:54.521 --> 30:55.488
Open it.

30:55.522 --> 30:58.291
I'm not gonna open it.
It's a man's private bag.

30:59.526 --> 31:00.594
You open it.

31:00.627 --> 31:02.128
I'm a girl.

31:02.162 --> 31:05.198
There's nothing in it
but medical supplies.

31:05.231 --> 31:09.135
Just--look, maybe there's
a phone number inside,
and we can call him.

31:09.169 --> 31:10.937
Right. Right.
We'll pretend we don't

31:10.971 --> 31:12.372
have his number
in the Rolodex.

31:12.405 --> 31:13.807
We shouldn't do this.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.576
Hurry up.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.514
Hello.

31:20.547 --> 31:21.481
BOTH: Aah!

31:21.515 --> 31:23.650
Jeez!

31:23.684 --> 31:25.251
George. Hey.

31:25.285 --> 31:27.654
I forgot my bag.

31:27.688 --> 31:30.190
Oh. Here it is.

31:31.925 --> 31:35.295
We were just
checking it for heads.

31:36.429 --> 31:38.098
I--I'm kidding.

31:40.266 --> 31:44.638
There's no honor
in being a lawyer today.

31:45.906 --> 31:48.575
Used to be
a dignified profession.

31:48.609 --> 31:50.276
Now...

31:51.812 --> 31:54.881
But there's gotta be a line.

31:54.915 --> 31:58.084
Steve Robin's sister
was murdered,

31:58.118 --> 32:01.421
and these people, the lawyers,
defending the guy

32:01.454 --> 32:02.322
charged with doing it,

32:02.355 --> 32:05.626
well, they decided
they'll blame Steve,

32:05.659 --> 32:08.028
fool him
into taking the stand

32:08.061 --> 32:12.232
under some duty
to tell the truth,

32:12.265 --> 32:15.301
and then ambush him
with an accusation

32:15.335 --> 32:17.337
they pretty much knew
to be false.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.807
It was indecent.
Unthinkable, really.

32:20.841 --> 32:23.476
And they do it
all the time--

32:23.510 --> 32:25.612
Plan "B."

32:25.646 --> 32:28.048
They figure
in a courtroom,

32:28.081 --> 32:31.117
they're insulated
from slander or defamation,

32:31.151 --> 32:35.355
and so they think nothing
of accusing brothers

32:35.388 --> 32:39.826
of killing sisters,
fathers of killing their babies.

32:39.860 --> 32:42.563
Anything
to get the client off.

32:42.596 --> 32:45.031
But there's gotta be a line.

32:46.767 --> 32:48.401
Where do we draw it?

32:48.434 --> 32:50.737
I really don't know.

32:50.771 --> 32:52.939
But when a lawyer knowingly

32:52.973 --> 32:55.742
sacrifices
a person's reputation

32:55.776 --> 32:58.244
with information
he knows isn't true,

32:58.278 --> 33:00.681
when you go after
a grieving brother

33:00.714 --> 33:05.651
and say that he chopped off
his own sister's head,

33:07.287 --> 33:10.691
I'd say the line
has been crossed.

33:10.724 --> 33:14.494
Now, everyone today is angry

33:14.528 --> 33:18.999
at how despicable
lawyers have become.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.970
Well, you have
a chance right now

33:24.004 --> 33:26.106
to send a message.

33:28.942 --> 33:33.647
Put these people
out of business.

33:56.637 --> 33:58.872
It's an adversarial process.

33:58.905 --> 34:01.074
And the rules,
though not popular,

34:01.107 --> 34:02.976
are pretty simple.

34:03.009 --> 34:05.011
State tries to convict.

34:05.045 --> 34:08.748
The defense lawyer does
everything he legally can

34:08.782 --> 34:10.917
to prevent that conviction.

34:10.951 --> 34:13.687
Not almost everything
he can--everything.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.755
It's not a choice.

34:15.789 --> 34:17.724
And if in the mind
of the lawyer

34:17.757 --> 34:20.627
pointing a finger
at the brother of the victim

34:20.661 --> 34:25.165
can secure an acquittal,
truth is, he has no right not to

34:25.197 --> 34:28.168
unless he knows
for a fact it's a lie,

34:28.201 --> 34:30.003
which here they didn't.

34:30.036 --> 34:32.172
The system doesn't work
if the lawyer says,

34:32.205 --> 34:34.741
"Hey, in this case I'll do
whatever I can,

34:34.775 --> 34:37.978
in that case, I won't."
You do whatever you can

34:38.011 --> 34:40.446
in every single case.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.783
Defense lawyers
cling to that rule.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.851
It's the only way
they can survive.

34:45.886 --> 34:50.991
Sometimes they retreat so far
inside that principle,

34:51.024 --> 34:54.159
they can seem
almost inhuman.

34:54.194 --> 34:56.530
That's what you saw
in Eugene Young.

34:56.563 --> 35:01.234
He didn't even seem like he had
much compassion, did he?

35:01.267 --> 35:03.970
I actually think he's in denial
as to what he does.

35:04.004 --> 35:05.939
It's not surprising,

35:05.972 --> 35:08.341
'cause what he has to do
a lot of the time

35:08.374 --> 35:10.577
would make most people sick.

35:10.611 --> 35:14.347
How do you go home
at night and sleep

35:14.380 --> 35:16.550
after getting a killer freed?
How can your stomach

35:16.583 --> 35:19.553
not turn at the idea
of fighting for some rapist?

35:19.586 --> 35:23.890
You saw in Eugene Young
a man who's freed killers

35:23.924 --> 35:25.025
only to have them
kill again.

35:25.058 --> 35:27.961
You saw
in Eugene Young a man

35:27.994 --> 35:29.996
who struggles with that.

35:30.030 --> 35:31.397
You saw in Eugene Young

35:31.431 --> 35:34.535
a man desperately
hanging on to his ideology

35:34.568 --> 35:38.739
to survive
what he does for a living.

35:38.772 --> 35:41.508
But believe it or not,

35:41.542 --> 35:45.712
that is where the truest
and deepest honor

35:45.746 --> 35:47.113
of this profession lies--

35:47.147 --> 35:51.184
doing an ugly job that
serves a higher purpose.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.720
The state incarcerates.

35:53.754 --> 35:57.457
The defense lawyer works
every day to check that balance

35:57.490 --> 36:01.595
so innocent people
don't get caught up in it.

36:01.628 --> 36:02.996
And you know what?

36:03.029 --> 36:05.165
An innocent man
got caught up in it here.

36:05.198 --> 36:07.300
The polygraph that he passed
was inadmissible,

36:07.333 --> 36:09.603
so the jury there
couldn't know about it.

36:09.636 --> 36:14.541
The circumstantial evidence was
so overwhelming and dramatic

36:14.575 --> 36:16.743
he was faced
with a sure conviction.

36:16.777 --> 36:19.946
The only thing he had
was a couple of lawyers

36:19.980 --> 36:22.015
willing to do everything
they could.

36:22.048 --> 36:24.885
As hard as this may be
to compute,

36:24.918 --> 36:28.555
Eugene Young was dignified
in going after Steve Robin

36:28.589 --> 36:31.291
not because Steve Robin
probably did it,

36:31.324 --> 36:34.127
but because he most
likely didn't,

36:34.160 --> 36:37.397
and that made
the duty ugly, dirty.

36:37.430 --> 36:40.466
Many attorneys would have
found a way not to do it

36:40.500 --> 36:44.237
and the innocent man
might have gone to jail.

36:46.439 --> 36:49.409
Over there sits somebody
who got hurt,

36:49.442 --> 36:52.546
and our compassion
has to go out to him.

36:52.579 --> 36:53.514
It has to.

36:53.547 --> 36:55.782
But it also must be tempered
with the reality

36:55.816 --> 36:58.585
that the worst result
would have been a man

36:58.619 --> 37:02.789
serving a life sentence
in prison for something
he didn't do.

37:02.823 --> 37:07.694
What this case really is

37:07.728 --> 37:13.133
is a referendum on
criminal defense attorneys

37:13.166 --> 37:15.636
and our system.

37:15.669 --> 37:20.106
You wanna pass judgment on that,
I suppose I can't stop you.

37:20.140 --> 37:22.576
But I know those people
at that table.

37:22.609 --> 37:26.513
I work side by side
with them every day.

37:26.547 --> 37:28.982
There's honor in that job.

37:31.017 --> 37:32.352
Trust me.

38:02.348 --> 38:06.386
(siren wails)

38:12.225 --> 38:13.760
It's 10:30.

38:13.794 --> 38:16.329
Just let me enjoy it.

38:17.463 --> 38:21.101
You see this suit?
It's my lucky suit.

38:21.134 --> 38:23.136
Problem is
it don't fit anymore.

38:23.169 --> 38:24.638
I had to diet all week.

38:24.671 --> 38:26.840
I've been dreaming of
this hot dog since Tuesday.

38:26.873 --> 38:28.208
(thud)

38:28.241 --> 38:31.044
And now I've dropped it.

38:31.077 --> 38:33.013
How's that for an omen?

38:38.184 --> 38:39.920
Thank you
for letting me do it.

38:39.953 --> 38:42.388
It was
a self-serving decision,

38:42.422 --> 38:44.190
nothing to help you.

38:44.224 --> 38:46.927
I know. That's what...

38:50.964 --> 38:52.566
I've spent my whole life

38:52.599 --> 38:54.400
thinking
I'm not good enough.

38:54.434 --> 38:56.202
Sometimes...

38:56.236 --> 38:58.438
If we lose,
you'll at least know

38:58.471 --> 39:02.475
your whole life...
you've been right.

39:03.577 --> 39:05.579
Jury's coming back.

39:05.612 --> 39:06.680
-What?
-In an hour?

39:06.713 --> 39:08.649
It's Friday.
It's Christmas.

39:08.682 --> 39:10.050
Let's go.

39:43.550 --> 39:46.553
JUDGE: The jury has
reached its verdict?

39:46.587 --> 39:48.221
We have, Your Honor.

39:48.254 --> 39:49.756
What say you?

39:51.257 --> 39:54.961
"In the matter of Robin vs.
Donnell, Young, Dole, and Frutt,

39:54.995 --> 39:57.363
on the count of defamation
of character,

39:57.397 --> 39:59.499
we find in favor
of the defendant.

40:00.601 --> 40:04.404
On the count
of intentional infliction
of emotional distress,

40:04.437 --> 40:06.840
we find in favor
of the defendant.

40:06.873 --> 40:09.209
On the count
of negligent infliction

40:09.242 --> 40:14.180
of emotional distress, we find
in favor of the defendant."

40:16.049 --> 40:19.119
JUDGE:
The jury is dismissed
with the court's thanks.

40:19.152 --> 40:20.220
We are adjourned.

40:20.253 --> 40:21.522
(bangs gavel)

40:35.301 --> 40:37.437
Great job.

40:46.079 --> 40:48.114
Yeah,
I'm a client too.

40:48.148 --> 40:49.482
What was your case?

40:49.516 --> 40:52.485
Oh, it was just some
boring litigation stuff.

40:52.519 --> 40:54.120
I like this place.

40:54.154 --> 40:55.488
People here are good.

40:55.522 --> 40:57.023
GEORGE: Yeah.

40:58.491 --> 40:59.993
Thanks.

41:08.602 --> 41:12.205
Listen, uh, we okay?

41:12.238 --> 41:13.339
You and me?

41:13.373 --> 41:16.910
Yeah. We're okay.

41:18.411 --> 41:20.781
Jimmy?

41:21.615 --> 41:23.316
Good closing.

41:34.394 --> 41:36.597
Yeah. Still partners,

unless you're thinking
of leaving.

41:38.965 --> 41:41.001
What?

41:41.034 --> 41:43.737
Helen said something.

41:47.608 --> 41:49.976
I'm not going anywhere.

41:50.010 --> 41:51.778
Yeah...

41:51.812 --> 41:53.413
I should be honest about--

41:53.446 --> 41:56.449
I--I don't mean to be cold.

41:56.482 --> 41:59.385
I mean, it's not that
I'm not interested.

41:59.419 --> 42:01.387
I just know
that it's not right,

42:01.421 --> 42:05.025
and for once
I'm going with my head.

42:05.058 --> 42:06.660
Oh, yeah, Lindsay,

42:06.693 --> 42:08.294
you and your heart.

42:08.328 --> 42:10.296
It's been
so out of control.

42:10.330 --> 42:13.299
What's that supposed
to mean?

42:13.333 --> 42:14.835
Nothing.

42:15.669 --> 42:17.671
It means
you're right.

42:17.704 --> 42:20.306
I'm going

42:20.340 --> 42:21.742
Good.

You and I haven't really
gotten to know each other yet,

Hi.
