00:40.517 --> 00:42.773
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

00:52.314 --> 00:54.408
Paul, what are you doing?

00:54.443 --> 00:55.938
It's a surprise.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.297
What is it?

00:57.332 --> 00:59.076
I don't like surprises.

00:59.111 --> 01:00.574
Mm, you're going to love this one,

01:00.609 --> 01:01.751
I promise. Come on.

01:01.786 --> 01:03.155
Where are we going?

01:03.912 --> 01:05.379
Tell me a clue.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.927
Is it in the garage?

01:09.860 --> 01:11.170
Okay, you want a clue?

01:11.987 --> 01:13.366
Here's a clue.

01:13.401 --> 01:16.677
A car.
A new car.

01:16.712 --> 01:19.387
- Is it that convertible I want?
- Maybe.

01:19.422 --> 01:21.621
I thought you were mad with me.

01:21.656 --> 01:23.464
How could anybody stay mad with you?

01:23.499 --> 01:28.512
You know, I would never really tell your
ex-wife anything about your bank accounts.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.012
Of course you wouldn't.

01:30.047 --> 01:33.025
I say crazy things because I love you.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.607
I love you, too.

01:36.652 --> 01:40.416
- Can I take it off?
- No. Not yet.

01:53.746 --> 01:56.937
Okay.
Now.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.486
I don't understand.

02:05.199 --> 02:08.752
- There is no surprise.
- Sure there is.

02:26.421 --> 02:28.633
MONK Season 3 Epi. 04
Mr. Monk gets fired

03:24.858 --> 03:26.650
Okay, everybody, listen up.

03:26.685 --> 03:28.462
You all know my wife Karen.

03:28.497 --> 03:33.078
- She's making a movie.
- A documentary, Leland.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.616
This is cinema verite.

03:34.651 --> 03:40.565
Right. It's for public television.
Um, about me. It's about all of us.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.240
Behind the scenes at a
typical detective division.

03:43.275 --> 03:45.714
The department figures
it'd be a good idea, good P. R.

03:45.749 --> 03:47.569
Just be yourselves.

03:47.604 --> 03:50.955
Just pretend that we're not even here.

04:02.969 --> 04:04.515
Chambers.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.721
Good work on that robbery
in north beach.

04:06.756 --> 04:08.788
- You really nailed them.
- I hope so.

04:08.823 --> 04:10.685
I hate those punks.

04:11.927 --> 04:14.029
Uh, we don't hate.

04:14.064 --> 04:16.902
No, we don't really hate anybody.
We, um...

04:17.439 --> 04:19.790
we try to understand them.

04:20.659 --> 04:23.959
the, uh, underlying causes,
the, uh...

04:23.994 --> 04:25.722
particularly the minorities.

04:25.757 --> 04:30.872
Captain, we got the prelim
on that fire from the hair outlet.

04:30.907 --> 04:33.873
- Looks like arson.
- That's what I thought.

04:33.908 --> 04:36.818
Yes, sir, you were right, again.

04:36.853 --> 04:39.255
I don't know how you do it
you and your hunches.

04:40.629 --> 04:42.257
Uh, what does the fire
marshal have to say?

04:42.292 --> 04:43.248
Two points of origin.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.326
And the test for artificial accelerant
came back negative. Uh, positive.

04:46.361 --> 04:48.084
Could I, shall I go back
and do that again?

04:48.119 --> 04:49.873
No, that's ok.

04:49.908 --> 04:54.933
Uh, the question is why would
anybody torch a wig factory?

04:54.968 --> 04:56.259
Does anybody have a motive?

04:56.294 --> 04:58.700
Probably the owner, for the insurance.

04:59.435 --> 05:03.644
That's an interesting theory, Randy,
but, uh, the, uh...

05:03.679 --> 05:06.369
the guy's dead, right?
He died in the fire.

05:06.404 --> 05:08.874
Right.
I forgot that.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.783
- Yeah.
- Am I interrupting something?

05:11.818 --> 05:14.028
Commissioner.
No, what a pleasant surprise.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.499
I'm sure it is.
What's going on?

05:16.534 --> 05:19.686
Oh, uh, they're filming a documentary
about this division.

05:19.721 --> 05:21.992
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

05:22.027 --> 05:25.908
Yeah, the, uh, public relations thought
that it would probably be good P. R.

05:25.943 --> 05:27.203
To do an educational film.

05:27.238 --> 05:29.212
How about good police work?

05:29.247 --> 05:31.488
That's the kind of P. R. we need.

05:33.085 --> 05:35.406
- You're right.
- Maybe it's a good thing,

05:35.441 --> 05:38.600
because at least now,
there'll be a record of me telling you

05:38.635 --> 05:40.702
to get your priorities straight

05:40.737 --> 05:42.066
What were you just talking about?

05:42.101 --> 05:44.859
Uh, the, uh, fire
up on 24th street, sir.

05:44.894 --> 05:48.401
- Oh, you mean this fire?
- Yes, sir.

05:48.436 --> 05:50.649
You mean this story?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.716
Because I thought you might
be working on this case.

05:53.751 --> 05:56.411
"Body headless, police clueless."

05:56.446 --> 05:59.757
What page is this on?

05:59.792 --> 06:01.571
- That's the front page.
- That's right.

06:01.606 --> 06:06.803
Front page, page 22.
Very important, not important.

06:06.838 --> 06:09.177
Press are all over us,
nobody cares.

06:09.212 --> 06:11.800
What case do you think we should
concentrate on, captain?

06:11.835 --> 06:13.638
- The torso case.
- Good choice.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.931
And in case you forget,

06:15.966 --> 06:21.275
you can always rewind your
tape and play it back. - Yeah.

06:23.346 --> 06:25.050
Commissioner!

06:25.085 --> 06:26.862
Is there a suspect in the torso murder?

06:26.897 --> 06:29.752
We're working on the case 24/7.
It's our number one priority.

06:29.787 --> 06:31.132
Can you identify the torso?

06:31.167 --> 06:33.374
She's female, caucasian.
That's all we know.

06:33.409 --> 06:35.744
The medical examiner will be issuing
his own report in the morning.

06:35.779 --> 06:37.918
Do you have any new leads?

06:37.953 --> 06:39.720
The investigation's at a critical
stage right now,

06:39.755 --> 06:42.424
and I don't want to do anything
or say anything that might compromise it,

06:42.459 --> 06:43.715
but I will say this.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.539
we're going to find
the monster who did this,

06:45.574 --> 06:46.708
and when we do,

06:46.743 --> 06:49.158
I can personally guarantee that he'll
be taken off the streets forever.

06:49.193 --> 06:51.415
- That's it for today.
- How about a motive, sir?

06:51.450 --> 06:54.405
You, wake up! Let's go!
What the hell?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.804
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

06:59.285 --> 07:01.038
- Are you okay, sir?
- Why wouldn't I be?

07:01.073 --> 07:02.934
That's insane. Why would
somebody steal your hat?

07:02.969 --> 07:05.146
How the hell do I know?
College prank, maybe?

07:05.181 --> 07:07.516
- Was it valuable?
- Forget the hat.

07:07.551 --> 07:10.202
We got bigger things
to worry about, detective.

07:10.237 --> 07:12.402
- The torso case, remember?
- Yes.

07:12.437 --> 07:15.102
I want you to go down to the
M. E.'s office, sit on the autopsy,

07:15.137 --> 07:17.146
- and let me know where we are.
- Yes, sir.

07:17.181 --> 07:20.027
Um, you remember
Sharona fleming, Adrian monk.

07:20.062 --> 07:23.432
I've asked Adrian in as a consultant
I thought a fresh pair of eyes...

07:23.467 --> 07:25.869
Consultant? What the hell
am I paying you for?

07:28.878 --> 07:30.217
I know Mr. Monk.

07:31.431 --> 07:33.746
Do you remember the last time
we met, Monk?

07:35.447 --> 07:38.069
You were lying under oath
about a friend of mine.

07:38.104 --> 07:42.018
- John marotta was a good cop.
- Marotta planted that gun.

07:42.053 --> 07:44.219
- Well, that's a matter of opinion.
- Well, not according to the jury.

07:44.254 --> 07:47.443
Don't touch me.

07:47.478 --> 07:49.190
As far as I'm concerned, Monk,

07:49.225 --> 07:51.445
You're coming into this with two strikes.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.574
- Understand me?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I do.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.209
Why are you still here?

08:02.329 --> 08:04.468
I can't stand that smell.

08:04.503 --> 08:06.329
Disinfectant.

08:06.364 --> 08:09.462
- It doesn't bother you?
- No, no. No, I like it.

08:09.497 --> 08:14.148
Victim is a female caucasian,
20 to 25 years of age.

08:14.183 --> 08:17.840
All four extremities have been
severed at a 45-degree angle,

08:17.875 --> 08:21.438
- posterior to anterior
- She's older.

08:21.473 --> 08:23.878
- Pardon me?
- She's at least 26.

08:23.913 --> 08:25.761
She was raised in
one of the baltic states.

08:25.796 --> 08:29.736
Estonia, Latvia, probably Lithuania.

08:29.771 --> 08:32.167
Anything else?

08:32.202 --> 08:33.806
No, no, that's it.

08:33.841 --> 08:39.111
Except the killer was a mountain
climber, very experienced,

08:39.145 --> 08:42.611
and, uh...
he's left-handed.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.575
You can tell all of that from this?

08:46.610 --> 08:50.914
Well, that scar on her upper arm
is from a smallpox vaccination.

08:50.949 --> 08:52.950
It was common in the baltic states.

08:52.985 --> 08:55.769
They stopped vaccinating in 1978,

08:57.356 --> 08:59.068
so she had to have been born before then.

08:59.103 --> 09:02.154
- What about mountain climber?
- The fiber rope and the knot.

09:02.189 --> 09:04.563
I believe it's called the prusik knot.

09:04.598 --> 09:06.394
Mountain climbers use it.

09:06.429 --> 09:10.148
And it's tied with the
top loop facing right,

09:10.183 --> 09:12.733
so of course, he's left-handed.

09:12.768 --> 09:15.317
Of course.

09:19.922 --> 09:22.895
- Um...
- What?

09:23.622 --> 09:25.847
- Well, um, uh...
- Oh, my god.

09:25.882 --> 09:27.626
What did you do?

09:27.661 --> 09:31.140
There were, there were some
crumbs in the, uh...

09:31.175 --> 09:35.772
No, no...
My case files.

09:35.807 --> 09:40.225
- You've deleted all of them.
- I'm sorry.

09:40.260 --> 09:43.565
Is it true? He deleted 10 years'
worth of forensic files?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.436
Yes, sir. It was an accident.

09:45.471 --> 09:47.898
He's an accident.
This is indefensible, captain.

09:47.933 --> 09:51.055
Look, the files were almost all backed up.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.064
They're trying to retrieve them now.

09:52.099 --> 09:53.895
I don't care.
The man is toast.

09:53.930 --> 09:56.467
He'll never work for this
department, with this department,

09:56.468 --> 09:58.952
or in this department again.
- Oh.

09:58.987 --> 10:03.575
And I'm pulling his private license.

10:03.610 --> 10:05.914
- No, you can't do that.
- It's already done.

10:08.011 --> 10:11.820
Commissioner Brooks...

10:11.855 --> 10:15.160
Police work, detection,
that's all Monk knows.

10:15.195 --> 10:17.806
If you do that, it will kill him.

10:17.841 --> 10:23.236
That's N. M. P.
Not my problem.

10:23.271 --> 10:24.656
You...

10:24.691 --> 10:27.888
You and I both know that this has
nothing to do with a few deleted files.

10:27.923 --> 10:30.652
This is payback because he
testified against your pal.

10:30.687 --> 10:32.815
Don't you second-guess
me on this one, captain.

10:32.850 --> 10:35.028
Adrian monk's detective days are over.

10:35.063 --> 10:38.310
Now, do you want to
tell him, or should I?

10:43.028 --> 10:45.577
No, I'll tell him.

11:29.998 --> 11:31.212
Sharona? - Yeah?

11:31.247 --> 11:34.585
It's your friend Mr. Monk.
He's here again.

11:34.620 --> 11:38.255
Oh, god.
Just hold on one sec, okay?

11:38.290 --> 11:41.461
He's out front.
He's been there for an hour.

11:42.584 --> 11:45.054
Look, he's having a
really tough week, okay?

11:45.089 --> 11:47.088
He just lost his job.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.887
Sharona, you know
how I feel about you.

11:49.922 --> 11:53.060
You're the best nurse I ever trained,
and you're welcome back anytime.

11:53.095 --> 11:55.847
But he's out there every day,

11:55.882 --> 11:58.365
just sitting there.
It's kind of creepy.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.861
It's not creepy.
He's just sad.

12:04.987 --> 12:07.570
And creepy.
I guess he's both, okay?

12:07.605 --> 12:10.200
- I'll go talk to him.
- Thank you.

13:02.221 --> 13:03.923
Would you like a cough drop?

13:04.843 --> 13:06.984
Cough drop? Here.

13:19.553 --> 13:22.409
Ah.
Ah.

13:43.546 --> 13:44.829
Adrian, what are you doing?

13:45.500 --> 13:46.686
What are you doing?

13:48.243 --> 13:51.548
He, he was coughing,
the poor guy.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.520
Come on. Here,
take this. Take this.

13:59.555 --> 14:01.067
Are you okay?

14:05.832 --> 14:07.602
What are you doing here?

14:07.637 --> 14:09.480
Have you talked to Stottlemeyer?

14:10.523 --> 14:12.073
I called him this morning.

14:12.108 --> 14:14.705
The commissioner still hasn't
changed his mind.

14:16.460 --> 14:17.698
Adrian, I know you're scared,

14:17.733 --> 14:19.453
but you can't keep following
me around like this.

14:19.488 --> 14:21.577
I can't afford to lose
two jobs in one week.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.424
- I just can't.
- Where should I go?

14:23.459 --> 14:25.672
It's a beautiful day outside.
Why don't you try taking a walk?

14:25.707 --> 14:27.227
But you just can't stay here.

14:27.262 --> 14:30.177
You're not allowed.
You are not a patient.

14:30.212 --> 14:35.194
Actually, I haven't been feeling so good.

14:35.229 --> 14:36.595
Really?

14:36.630 --> 14:39.945
I think I'm may becoming
down with something.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.651
I might have caught what he has.

14:43.686 --> 14:45.968
- So you want to be admitted?
- Well...

14:46.003 --> 14:49.149
Mm, then I have to take
your temperature. - Okay.

14:52.366 --> 14:54.824
It's not that kind of thermometer.

14:55.861 --> 14:58.414
You know, I think
I will take that walk.

14:59.112 --> 15:00.668
Thought so.

15:01.885 --> 15:04.175
Captain, we caught a break.

15:05.350 --> 15:07.873
- Swish.
- Nice shot.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.966
Thank you.
What do you got?

15:10.001 --> 15:12.125
I think we I. Ded the torso.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.675
We got a report of a missing person.

15:13.710 --> 15:16.552
Her name is Larysa zeryeva,
29 years old.

15:16.587 --> 15:19.381
Guess where she's from.

15:19.416 --> 15:22.142
Uh...
one of the baltic states.

15:22.177 --> 15:25.707
- Which baltic state?
- Uh...

15:25.742 --> 15:31.498
Estonia.
Latvia.

15:31.533 --> 15:34.060
- Lithuania?
- Lithuania.

15:34.095 --> 15:37.361
- Is there a DNA match?
- No, that's the problem.

15:37.396 --> 15:40.875
We've got plenty of DNA from the torso,
but we've got nothing to match it against.

15:40.910 --> 15:42.826
We can't find a sample
from the missing girl.

15:42.861 --> 15:45.601
- Okay, well, who filed this report?
- Uh...

15:45.636 --> 15:48.547
Ellen harley.
Zeryeva was her housekeeper.

15:48.582 --> 15:49.707
Get this.

15:49.742 --> 15:51.539
Mrs. Harley is sure
that her ex-husband Paul

15:51.540 --> 15:53.216
is somehow involved in the disappearance.

15:53.251 --> 15:55.758
And guess what Paul was
doing last summer.

15:55.793 --> 15:59.677
Lieutenant, I'm not guessing anymore.

15:59.712 --> 16:02.421
He was climbing Mt. Mckinley.
He's a mountain climber.

16:02.456 --> 16:05.186
Monk nailed it.

16:05.221 --> 16:07.493
You and monk.

16:07.528 --> 16:09.514
Congratulations, sir.

16:09.549 --> 16:11.415
To both of you.

16:11.450 --> 16:13.872
But mostly you.

16:56.718 --> 16:58.863
Oh, oh, oh, and then...

17:00.755 --> 17:04.134
- That's a leaf.
- I know, but as long as you're here...

17:09.374 --> 17:11.092
You think you're better than me,

17:11.127 --> 17:13.334
sitting there pointing at leaves?

17:13.368 --> 17:16.093
I used to make 210 grand a year.

17:18.146 --> 17:20.470
What, what happened?

17:20.505 --> 17:23.415
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

17:23.451 --> 17:26.313
I made a mistake.
I took a week off,

17:26.348 --> 17:28.940
and they realized they
didn't need me anymore.

17:35.939 --> 17:37.786
Okay, Mrs. Harley,
let's start again.

17:37.821 --> 17:39.928
When was the last time
you saw her?

17:40.898 --> 17:42.283
I don't know. I mean
I can't remember.

17:42.318 --> 17:45.514
This is very entertaining, captain,
but, really, I got to get back to work,

17:45.549 --> 17:48.954
- so how much longer are you going to be?
- As long as it takes, Mr. Harley.

17:48.989 --> 17:51.796
She's not here.
For the 500th time, we had a fight,

17:51.831 --> 17:53.828
She left.
She went home.

17:54.377 --> 17:57.923
- You killed her.
- Who says? My ex-wife?

17:59.889 --> 18:02.095
Larysa zeryeva is alive and well.

18:02.130 --> 18:04.356
She called me three days ago from Paris.
Check the phone records.

18:04.391 --> 18:05.350
We already did.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.473
Somebody called you from the Paris
airport, but it wasn't her.

18:09.550 --> 18:11.317
Captain, Monk's here.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.044
- He's where?
- He's outside in the garage.

18:14.079 --> 18:15.627
What's he doing here?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.137
I don't know. He's Monk.

18:54.937 --> 18:57.993
For god's sake, Monk,
what are you doing here?

18:59.433 --> 19:02.223
Okay, look,
you can't stay.

19:02.258 --> 19:04.470
The commissioner could be here any minute.

19:04.471 --> 19:06.946
If he finds you here,
we're both out of work.

19:06.981 --> 19:09.718
This garage has been cleaned..

19:09.753 --> 19:12.350
scrubbed with bleach recently.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.085
Yeah, you should see the house.
It's like a hospital in there.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.198
You could almost live in it.

19:20.562 --> 19:22.269
- He's left-handed.
- That's right.

19:22.304 --> 19:24.438
He's a left-handed mountain climber.

19:25.516 --> 19:27.606
- Is he the guy?
- Oh, yeah, he's not only the guy,

19:27.641 --> 19:29.270
he's almost bragging about it.

19:29.305 --> 19:31.295
We got a boatload of
circumstantial evidence,

19:31.330 --> 19:35.372
but the D. A. Will not move
until we can I. D. The torso.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.253
Hey, Monk.

19:39.288 --> 19:42.355
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.783
Really?

19:46.130 --> 19:47.994
Monk was just leaving.
What do you got?

19:48.029 --> 19:50.704
The ex-wife is absolutely
100% sure he killed her.

19:50.739 --> 19:52.787
She gave me these photos.

19:52.822 --> 19:54.205
Which one is the most recent?

19:54.240 --> 19:56.211
- The one with the short hair.
- This one?

19:56.246 --> 19:58.960
Yeah, it's a month old.
Should we publish it?

19:58.995 --> 20:01.312
Yeah, we might as well.
Somebody might have seen something.

20:01.347 --> 20:04.181
- Right.
- Excuse me, cap,

20:04.216 --> 20:05.520
you know, they're cutting up
my carpet in there,

20:05.555 --> 20:08.359
and that's imported shag, man.
Am I going to get reimbursed for that?

20:08.394 --> 20:11.847
Why don't you file a complaint
with the county clerk?

20:11.882 --> 20:14.663
You killed her in here, didn't you?

20:14.698 --> 20:16.692
I know you.

20:16.727 --> 20:20.237
You're that detective Monk.
Yeah, I've seen you on the news, man.

20:20.272 --> 20:23.503
I've seen your work, too,
on a table in a forensics lab.

20:23.538 --> 20:26.590
Did you cut her up in here, too?
I'll bet you did.

20:26.625 --> 20:30.054
Do you own a chain saw?

20:30.089 --> 20:32.664
No.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.711
But...

20:34.746 --> 20:40.710
You have a spare blade
for a chain saw...

20:40.745 --> 20:46.191
and a space on your pegboard
here for a chain saw,

20:46.226 --> 20:48.680
but no chain saw.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.680
Oh, I had one. It broke.
I tossed it.

20:51.715 --> 20:55.664
- When?
- I forget.

20:55.699 --> 20:59.389
You know how DNA works, Mr. Harley?

20:59.424 --> 21:03.055
All we need is a speck...

21:03.090 --> 21:05.367
piece of fiber,

21:05.402 --> 21:09.333
piece of skin,
a strand of hair

21:09.368 --> 21:13.286
that ties the torso they
found to this house.

21:13.321 --> 21:17.301
You think your house is that clean, mister?

21:17.336 --> 21:21.000
You don't know the meaning of clean.

21:21.035 --> 21:23.626
So what are you saying?

21:23.661 --> 21:25.953
You forgot something.

21:25.988 --> 21:28.686
You made a mistake, and
I'm going to find it.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.758
Roger that.

21:30.793 --> 21:33.349
The commissioner's here.
He just pulled up.

21:33.384 --> 21:35.314
Monk, you got to go.

21:35.349 --> 21:37.050
Randy's going to take you
out the back way.

21:37.085 --> 21:41.384
Come on.
come on, come on, come on.

21:51.021 --> 21:55.994
I must've walked for two,
maybe three hours.

21:57.294 --> 21:59.359
I don't even remember.

21:59.394 --> 22:04.757
I, I just found myself there
at the crime scene.

22:05.047 --> 22:07.375
Well, it's understandable.

22:08.492 --> 22:12.127
You've been a detective for a long time.
You can't just let that go.

22:12.162 --> 22:18.720
I never appreciated how
much the job meant to me.

22:19.521 --> 22:21.578
I feel lost.

22:23.155 --> 22:26.611
Nothing... fits.

22:26.646 --> 22:30.893
You know, maybe it's a blessing.

22:30.928 --> 22:32.821
An opportunity.

22:32.856 --> 22:37.883
One of my favorite expressions is
when god closes a window,

22:37.918 --> 22:40.207
he opens a door.
Do you believe that?

22:40.242 --> 22:43.540
Do I believe it's one of your
favorite expressions?

22:43.575 --> 22:48.496
No. Do you believe that change
can be a positive thing?

22:48.531 --> 22:52.722
Huh.
I...

22:52.757 --> 22:55.544
- I have a job interview tomorrow.
- Really?

22:55.579 --> 22:58.013
- That's, that's wonderful.
- It's Sharona's idea.

22:58.048 --> 23:02.372
It's at a magazine.
They're looking for a fact checker.

23:02.407 --> 23:05.816
Perfect.
You excited?

23:05.851 --> 23:11.253
I'm scared to death.
It's my first job interview in 20 years.

23:11.288 --> 23:12.546
You're going to be fine.

23:12.581 --> 23:14.761
You just have to be your...

23:18.740 --> 23:20.076
Myself?

23:20.111 --> 23:22.657
Why don't we practice right now?

23:22.692 --> 23:25.383
Okay? I'll be the personnel director.

23:25.418 --> 23:27.333
Who am I?

23:27.368 --> 23:31.134
You're you.

23:31.169 --> 23:34.060
Fine.
Fine, I'll be me.

23:34.095 --> 23:36.344
Okay.

23:36.379 --> 23:38.383
Hello, Adrian.
Thank you for coming in.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.285
Why don't you tell me a little
bit about yourself?

23:43.281 --> 23:45.599
Well,

23:45.634 --> 23:51.561
I was married for seven years
until a car bomb killed my wife.

23:51.596 --> 23:55.038
I've spent the last seven years

23:55.073 --> 24:02.843
trying to track down the people
responsible for my wife's murder.

24:02.878 --> 24:06.354
- Do you have any hobbies?
- I do.

24:06.389 --> 24:09.176
I spend my free time
tracking down the people

24:09.211 --> 24:11.679
who planted the car bomb
that killed my wife.

24:11.714 --> 24:15.017
Okay, Adrian, just a little pointer here.

24:15.052 --> 24:20.660
Maybe you don't have to
keep mentioning the car bomb.

24:20.695 --> 24:24.683
Okay.
I'll just say bomb.

24:27.312 --> 24:28.455
Captain?

24:29.624 --> 24:32.406
The commissioner is on line one.

24:32.441 --> 24:35.787
Uh...
I'm busy. I'll call him back.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.049
Right.

24:38.202 --> 24:39.327
Sir?

24:39.362 --> 24:41.062
Hi, yeah, he's a little
bit busy right now.

24:41.097 --> 24:42.527
Could he call you back...

24:42.562 --> 24:45.358
Yes, sir. Speaker phone.

24:45.393 --> 24:49.702
He wants us both to hear this.

24:49.737 --> 24:51.856
Commissioner, hi,
I was just about to call you.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.958
Why? To tell me how you're
screwing up the case?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.710
I have a press conference
tomorrow morning.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.430
What can I tell them?
Do we have a suspect?

24:57.465 --> 24:58.832
Not officially, sir.

24:58.867 --> 25:02.141
We still cannot link
Paul harley to the torso.

25:02.176 --> 25:04.224
You can't find a single follicle or fiber?

25:04.259 --> 25:06.475
We're still at the house, sir.
We're still looking.

25:06.510 --> 25:07.923
It's probably right under your nose.

25:07.958 --> 25:10.265
Where did you get your badge, captain?
in a box of cracker jacks?

25:10.300 --> 25:13.577
Are you a police captain or not, hmm?

25:13.612 --> 25:14.824
Yes, I am, sir.

25:14.859 --> 25:17.825
Then act like one, or I'll
find someone who will.

25:19.778 --> 25:24.995
Yes, sir, thank you.
I'll talk to you later.

25:27.584 --> 25:30.260
I'm not even sure that
was the commissioner.

25:30.295 --> 25:34.642
Randy, give me a moment here?

25:34.677 --> 25:36.857
You, too, boomer.
Thank you.

25:39.019 --> 25:41.107
Honey...

25:49.658 --> 25:52.777
So...
how do you think it's going?

25:52.812 --> 25:56.448
It's great. This is some of the best
footage I've ever gotten.

25:56.483 --> 25:58.565
So, how do you think it's going?

25:58.600 --> 26:04.456
Karen, it was a big, big mistake.

26:04.491 --> 26:06.365
Then why did you agree to do it?

26:06.400 --> 26:09.698
Because you were relentless.
You kept coming at me.

26:11.220 --> 26:15.416
And I, I guess I was flattered
that you asked.

26:15.451 --> 26:17.386
Because I love you.

26:17.421 --> 26:19.562
But, honey, I have hit a wall
with this case.

26:19.597 --> 26:22.422
I haven't got monk.
I've got the commissioner all over me.

26:22.457 --> 26:25.215
It's embarrassing.

26:27.699 --> 26:30.859
Wait, is that thing on?

26:30.894 --> 26:33.402
It's all part of it, Leland.
This is a documentary.

26:33.437 --> 26:34.818
Karen, please.

26:34.853 --> 26:37.941
Leland, this is the most important
thing I've ever done in my entire life,

26:37.976 --> 26:42.924
and to stop now would destroy me,
but if you want me to...

26:42.959 --> 26:45.152
I will.

26:47.997 --> 26:50.470
No, it's okay.

26:52.854 --> 26:54.848
It's okay.

27:11.552 --> 27:12.750
Are you okay?

27:12.785 --> 27:14.901
I'm fine, thank you.

27:14.936 --> 27:17.396
The chair is a little wobbly.

27:17.431 --> 27:20.185
You'd think it would bother me,

27:20.220 --> 27:22.466
but it doesn't.

27:22.501 --> 27:25.565
Let's see, Adrian monk.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.318
When did you fill this out?

27:27.353 --> 27:29.431
Just now in the waiting room.

27:29.466 --> 27:31.163
But it's typed.

27:31.198 --> 27:36.139
No, ma'am, I, I used a pencil.

27:36.174 --> 27:38.177
This is the neatest handwriting
I've ever seen.

27:38.212 --> 27:40.329
Thank you.

27:40.364 --> 27:45.487
Sharona said I should start off
with a joke to break the ice.

27:45.522 --> 27:50.319
- Who's Sharona?
- My nurse.

27:50.354 --> 27:52.977
- Do you like marmaduke?
- Who?

27:53.012 --> 27:54.871
He's in the comics.
He's a dog.

27:54.906 --> 28:00.396
But he's big. He's the biggest
dog in the world.

28:00.431 --> 28:02.798
Today...

28:02.833 --> 28:05.671
he got stuck in the doggie door again.

28:05.706 --> 28:07.196
And the man said,

28:07.231 --> 28:11.072
"at least this time,
he's facing the right way."

28:12.888 --> 28:15.449
You can learn a lot from marmaduke.

28:15.484 --> 28:17.134
I think I just did.

28:17.169 --> 28:19.896
Mr. Monk, what would you say
is your greatest strength?

28:19.931 --> 28:25.478
Oh.
Mm...

28:50.979 --> 28:53.175
my decisiveness.

28:53.210 --> 28:56.798
- Would you like another chair?
- No. I'm fine.

28:56.833 --> 28:59.814
I'm normal.
I'm a normal person.

28:59.849 --> 29:02.894
I see here you worked as a consultant
for the police department.

29:02.929 --> 29:04.223
That must've been very exciting.

29:04.258 --> 29:06.703
Um, have you ever done any fact checking?

29:06.738 --> 29:11.591
Um, no, ma'am, unless you
count this morning.

29:11.626 --> 29:12.965
What happened this morning?

29:13.000 --> 29:19.700
Well, Sharona took me to the library to
look at some back issues of your magazine.

29:19.735 --> 29:22.306
I found a few mistakes.

29:26.860 --> 29:28.955
I...

29:28.990 --> 29:31.292
page 32, "the building was decimated."

29:31.327 --> 29:33.123
Technically inaccurate.

29:33.158 --> 29:37.100
Decimate means "to reduce by 1/10th."

29:37.135 --> 29:41.582
- Deci-mate.
- Wow.

29:41.617 --> 29:45.025
And you did all this
this morning in the library.

29:45.060 --> 29:46.568
How many magazines did you read?

29:46.603 --> 29:49.670
One. Just that,
just that one.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.811
One.
Wow.

29:51.846 --> 29:54.816
It's a gift.

29:54.851 --> 29:57.431
And, and a curse.

29:57.466 --> 29:59.899
I can see that.

29:59.934 --> 30:01.186
Do you have any questions for me?

30:01.221 --> 30:03.871
Just, uh, yes.

30:03.906 --> 30:06.590
If, if I get the job,

30:06.625 --> 30:08.151
will this be my chair?

30:08.186 --> 30:10.568
Not while I'm here.

30:12.152 --> 30:14.028
Adrian?

30:28.974 --> 30:30.815
Adrian!

30:41.439 --> 30:44.710
Adrian.

30:44.745 --> 30:46.946
Are you okay?

30:48.395 --> 30:52.874
You know, I...
I, I've been worrying about you.

30:52.909 --> 30:55.450
Me too.

30:55.485 --> 30:58.331
Did you go on the interview?

31:01.991 --> 31:04.300
Was it that bad?

31:05.623 --> 31:07.473
It was pretty bad.

31:07.508 --> 31:11.403
Adrian, I am so sorry.

31:11.438 --> 31:13.298
But you know what?

31:13.333 --> 31:16.626
The most important thing
is that you did it.

31:16.661 --> 31:18.048
So don't be so discouraged.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.767
I mean, there's a million
other jobs out there.

31:19.802 --> 31:22.739
I got the job.

31:22.774 --> 31:25.310
What?

31:27.476 --> 31:29.985
I start on monday.

31:32.407 --> 31:35.994
$42,000 a year, plus a medical plan?

31:36.029 --> 31:39.700
Four weeks paid vacation
and a dental plan?

31:40.176 --> 31:43.031
You got that on your,
on your first interview?

31:43.066 --> 31:46.379
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.

31:47.968 --> 31:50.777
Did you tell her that marmaduke joke?

31:50.812 --> 31:55.892
You told her that stupid joke,
and now you have a medical plan?

31:55.927 --> 31:58.047
I'm sorry.

32:01.558 --> 32:04.974
Adrian, I didn't mean that.

32:05.508 --> 32:10.042
I'm really happy for you.
Really.

32:12.088 --> 32:14.275
Congratulations.

32:18.116 --> 32:20.791
What's the problem?
It's a great job.

32:20.826 --> 32:22.857
I had a great job.

32:22.892 --> 32:26.326
I was a cop.
That's all I ever wanted to be.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.462
I couldn't fix the whole world.
I knew that.

32:28.497 --> 32:32.596
But I could fix...
little pieces of it.

32:32.631 --> 32:36.738
One little piece at a time.

32:37.382 --> 32:41.008
Put things back together.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.692
Sharona, I, I need it.
I need it. I miss it.

32:45.727 --> 32:48.948
- I miss it so much.
- Hey.

32:48.983 --> 32:51.946
I miss it, too.

32:52.894 --> 32:54.632
It's, it's gonna kill me.

32:54.667 --> 32:59.152
Every time I watch the news
or read a newspaper or...

32:59.187 --> 33:01.747
I'm gonna wish I was there.

33:01.782 --> 33:05.865
Even a stupid story like...
"the mad hatter"

33:08.438 --> 33:09.520
"The mad hatter"?

33:09.555 --> 33:12.198
Yeah, remember somebody grabbed
the commissioner's hat?

33:12.233 --> 33:15.294
Well, he did it again at
a parking garage downtown.

33:15.329 --> 33:17.838
- Was it the same guy?
They don't know. He got away.

33:17.873 --> 33:20.422
But at least he got
his hat back this time.

33:20.457 --> 33:24.972
Well, he grabbed the commissioner's
hat twice and dropped it?

33:25.007 --> 33:28.499
He, he didn't want it?

33:36.485 --> 33:39.066
- What?
- I just solved the case.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.562
Wait, wait, wait, you figured out
who grabbed the hat?

33:41.597 --> 33:44.121
The other case, the big one.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.957
The torso murder and
the commissioner's hat.

33:48.248 --> 33:50.166
- They're both connected.
- They are?

33:50.201 --> 33:52.165
Sharona, they're gonna
have to rehire me.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.005
They're gonna have to.

34:03.091 --> 34:06.469
- Adrian, what are you doing?
- I solved the case!

34:07.323 --> 34:10.501
Yeah, I know, but...
What are you doing?

34:10.536 --> 34:13.817
I'm happy.
I'm doing a jig.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.263
- That's not a jig.
- What is it, then?

34:16.297 --> 34:19.866
You know what? I don't know.
And I don't wanna know.

34:20.456 --> 34:22.411
I'm back, baby!

34:23.909 --> 34:25.989
I'm back!

34:31.126 --> 34:32.822
Where's the captain?
He said it was urgent.

34:32.858 --> 34:34.677
We're in here, commissioner.

34:34.712 --> 34:36.056
What's going on?

34:36.091 --> 34:39.556
- What's he doing here?
- He's here as my guest.

34:39.591 --> 34:41.342
We have an arrest warrant
for Paul harley.

34:41.378 --> 34:43.574
It's all filled out and ready to roll.

34:43.610 --> 34:45.553
So you finally found some DNA.

34:45.588 --> 34:48.695
- You can finally identify the torso.
- Yes, sir.

34:48.730 --> 34:50.806
So, what are you waiting for?

34:50.841 --> 34:53.601
We're waiting for you, commissioner.

34:53.636 --> 34:56.587
Why are you smiling?

34:56.621 --> 34:59.160
You'll find out soon enough.

34:59.195 --> 35:01.160
Mr. Monk...

35:01.195 --> 35:03.715
why don't you tell us
why we're all here?

35:05.489 --> 35:09.152
Paul harley killed his
girlfriend Larysa zeryeva.

35:09.187 --> 35:14.313
He cut her up and dumped
her body into the bay.

35:14.348 --> 35:18.264
He cleaned his house.
He scrubbed, he dusted.

35:18.299 --> 35:22.305
He wiped away any trace of her...

35:22.340 --> 35:26.335
until she disappeared.

35:26.370 --> 35:30.922
And then he must've found something,
a piece of paper...

35:30.957 --> 35:32.605
that scared him half to death.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.442
Well, what was it?

35:34.477 --> 35:37.906
It was a receipt from the hair
outlet on 24th street.

35:37.941 --> 35:40.209
They make wigs from human hair.

35:40.244 --> 35:43.399
Larysa had very long hair.

35:43.434 --> 35:45.784
A month before she was murdered,
she cut it all off.

35:45.819 --> 35:47.081
We all saw the picture.

35:47.116 --> 35:48.721
She sold her hair to a wigmaker.

35:48.756 --> 35:50.926
- Lots of women do that.
- The hair outlet.

35:50.961 --> 35:53.536
- Isn't that the place that...
- That burned down last week.

35:53.571 --> 35:56.179
- That's right.
- Harley was in trouble.

35:56.214 --> 35:59.619
He knew there was
a wig out there somewhere

35:59.654 --> 36:03.543
made from Larysa's hair...
a wig full of her DNA.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.307
He had to get it back
before we tracked it down.

36:06.342 --> 36:08.841
So he broke into the hair outlet,

36:08.876 --> 36:10.692
killed the owner...

36:10.727 --> 36:14.280
and he rifled through the sales receipts

36:14.315 --> 36:16.453
until he found what he needed.

36:16.488 --> 36:18.317
And then destroyed the evidence.

36:18.352 --> 36:19.985
Or...tried to.

36:20.020 --> 36:23.486
We got lucky.
Some of the records survived the fire.

36:23.521 --> 36:27.006
We know who bought Larysa's hair.

36:27.041 --> 36:29.691
So, who is it?
Where's the wig?

36:29.726 --> 36:31.584
It's not a wig.

36:31.619 --> 36:33.303
It's a toupee.

36:34.456 --> 36:36.254
Hmm.

36:39.259 --> 36:42.215
It's your toupee, sir.

36:46.179 --> 36:48.677
A toupee.

36:48.712 --> 36:51.523
Your toupee.

36:51.558 --> 36:54.104
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come on, it's a rug.

36:54.139 --> 36:56.725
- What, are you gonna deny it?
- I don't wear a toupee.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.562
It was Paul harley that
was grabbing your hat.

36:59.597 --> 37:02.404
Except he wasn't after your hat.

37:02.439 --> 37:05.882
- He was trying to grab your...
- Head doily.

37:05.917 --> 37:08.673
- I can see it from here.
- This is my own hair.

37:08.708 --> 37:10.380
You mean you would let a murderer

37:10.415 --> 37:15.316
a man who killed two people
in cold blood walk...

37:15.351 --> 37:20.545
because, because you refuse to admit
that you're wearing a piece?

37:23.516 --> 37:24.855
I get it.

37:24.890 --> 37:26.792
You're trying to embarrass
me in front of the camera.

37:26.827 --> 37:29.881
Nobody's trying to embarrass you,
commissioner,

37:29.916 --> 37:32.557
but I am going to rip that
hairpiece off of your head.

37:32.592 --> 37:35.643
It is a critical piece of evidence.

37:35.678 --> 37:37.734
You wouldn't dare.

37:39.425 --> 37:43.861
- Are you sure?
- 100%

37:55.041 --> 37:59.667
93 to 94%.

38:05.762 --> 38:07.795
74%.

38:07.830 --> 38:09.705
Are you finished?

38:13.641 --> 38:17.113
Okay.
The answer is...yes.

38:17.148 --> 38:22.615
You, my friend, are finished
in every sense of the word!

38:26.992 --> 38:30.204
74% is good enough for me.

38:30.239 --> 38:32.900
Aah, get off me, get off me!

38:32.935 --> 38:35.799
Get her off me!

38:44.832 --> 38:48.262
You said it was right under our noses.

38:48.297 --> 38:50.152
Lieutenant.

38:52.379 --> 38:54.643
I think the lab is looking for that.

38:55.641 --> 38:58.052
You can edit this out, right?
This doesn't have to be in the movie.

38:58.087 --> 38:59.393
Well, I don't know, commissioner.

38:59.428 --> 39:03.342
It's a pretty amazing scene, you know.
I'd hate to lose it.

39:04.202 --> 39:08.073
What can I say?
It's cinema veite.

39:08.108 --> 39:10.994
Isn't there anything I can do?

39:11.029 --> 39:13.062
Actually, commissioner,

39:14.742 --> 39:17.582
there is one thing.

39:25.811 --> 39:31.804
Do you remember my friend Adrian monk?

39:41.850 --> 39:44.271
And action!

39:45.386 --> 39:47.001
Cover the back.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.788
- Keep your eyes open.
- Yes, sir.

39:56.909 --> 39:58.613
Paul harley?

39:58.648 --> 40:03.684
Open up. San francisco P. D.

40:04.387 --> 40:06.221
Good morning, Paul.

40:06.256 --> 40:08.802
Step out on the porch, please.

40:12.995 --> 40:16.721
I have a warrant here.

40:16.756 --> 40:22.925
A warrant here for your arrest for
the premeditated murder of Larysa zeryeva.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.597
Lieutenant, take this piece
of garbage downtown.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.946
With pleasure.

40:27.981 --> 40:30.943
You're under arrest, Mr. Harley.

40:34.163 --> 40:37.148
- Get him outta here!
- Let's go.

40:37.183 --> 40:41.708
You know, captain, it's moments like these
that I remember why I joined the force.

40:41.743 --> 40:44.964
I realized that's where I belonged.

40:44.999 --> 40:47.418
I belong behind the badge.

40:49.503 --> 40:55.506
Nevermind.
Lieutenant, just... go downtown.

40:55.541 --> 40:57.189
Book him.

40:59.471 --> 41:00.841
What did you think?

41:00.876 --> 41:06.229
- You're a star. You're my star.
- Thank you.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.332
- That was great.
- Thanks.

41:08.367 --> 41:09.653
Good versus evil...

41:09.688 --> 41:16.105
it's just more of a constant struggle
between right and wrong.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.209
Good and evil, it's the oldest
struggle in the world.

41:19.244 --> 41:24.816
Am I afraid of dying?
Everybody dies.

41:24.851 --> 41:29.387
Dying is just a part of living.
But when I go,

41:29.422 --> 41:34.966
I'm gonna go with my badge held high
and then to my house justified...

41:35.001 --> 41:38.460
because it's my life.

41:38.495 --> 41:41.594
My life behind the badge.
