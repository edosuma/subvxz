(Exhales deeply)

00:24.095 --> 00:28.329
(Footsteps approaching)

00:32.563 --> 00:34.404
Am I interrupting?

00:34.405 --> 00:36.606
Lacey horseback riding.

00:36.607 --> 00:40.611
I remember when a
phone was just a phone.

00:42.413 --> 00:43.813
You look well.

00:43.814 --> 00:46.216
So do you.

00:46.217 --> 00:48.678
Mm. And what's good here?

00:48.679 --> 00:51.281
Uh, blueberry scones.
Stains the teeth.

00:51.282 --> 00:53.153
Quiche. Not a fan.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.555
Coffee? Would you
put that thing down?

00:55.556 --> 00:58.558
This is supposed to be my
quality time with my daughter.

00:58.559 --> 01:02.562
I want to show you my favorite.

01:02.563 --> 01:06.166
She looks just like you
at that age. (Chuckles)

01:06.167 --> 01:09.469
I thought your father was out
of his mind, letting you do that.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.471
For god sakes, tell
her to be careful.

01:11.472 --> 01:15.445
You of all people should know
how fast an accident can happen.

01:15.446 --> 01:17.647
(Knife clatters,
cell phone chimes)

01:17.648 --> 01:20.850
Can I have my
phone back, please?

01:20.851 --> 01:23.853
A Peter dunlop just
sent you a text message.

01:23.854 --> 01:27.457
"Db on route 14.
Chief wants u." Mom.

01:27.458 --> 01:31.691
Spelled the letter "u," by the way.
Just give me my damn phone, please.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.423
(Sighs)

01:33.424 --> 01:35.325
(Beeps)

01:35.326 --> 01:36.726
I have to go.

01:36.727 --> 01:38.328
Of course you do.

01:38.329 --> 01:40.600
There's a dead body
out there somewhere

01:40.601 --> 01:44.374
who's more important than I am.
As usual, you don't understand.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.176
I understand, all right.

01:46.177 --> 01:49.179
You care more about the
dead than you do about the living

01:49.180 --> 01:51.341
because they can't talk back.

01:51.342 --> 01:55.586
(Sighs) Believe it or not,
they have something to say.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.192
(Sirens wailing)

02:05.526 --> 02:07.527
You know that's
Joe salerno, right?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.729
He's one of ours. He
may be one of yours,

02:09.730 --> 02:12.502
but it's our scene until I say
otherwise. So say otherwise.

02:12.503 --> 02:15.305
Not until Dr. Hunt gets here.
Yeah, that's right. Thanks.

02:15.306 --> 02:18.168
We're joined at the hip now because of
you. Why don't you go start a canvass?

02:18.169 --> 02:20.410
Oh, really? Look for suspects?
Why didn't I think of that?

02:20.411 --> 02:22.141
(Camera shutter clicks)

02:22.142 --> 02:25.144
Hey, you! Get back!
Up that hill right now.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.378
(Megan) We have got
spectators. Why all the attention?

02:28.379 --> 02:30.380
Victim's name is Joe salerno...

02:30.381 --> 02:32.422
18-year vet of the force,

02:32.423 --> 02:35.425
homicide detective for the past
six. Whoever hit him didn't stop.

02:35.426 --> 02:37.827
The cops are out
for blood on this one.

02:37.828 --> 02:39.589
So was somebody else.

02:39.590 --> 02:42.161
(Police radio chatter)

02:42.162 --> 02:43.593
(Sirens wailing)

02:43.594 --> 02:45.535
Bruising in the joints,

02:45.536 --> 02:47.397
petechiae.

02:47.398 --> 02:50.270
Not much on the ground. Huh.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.541
Hmm.

02:51.542 --> 02:53.203
See something?

02:53.204 --> 02:55.305
It's what I'm not
seeing that interests me.

02:55.306 --> 02:58.308
How long has he been here?
The call came just before daybreak.

02:58.309 --> 03:01.611
(Radio chatter continues)

03:01.612 --> 03:05.455
His blood is not coagulating.

03:05.456 --> 03:07.487
Two hours. It should
be molasses by now.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.858
Maybe the timeline's off.

03:08.859 --> 03:11.521
Something's off. Peter,
get a sample, will you?

03:11.522 --> 03:13.323
Sure.

03:13.324 --> 03:15.325
I cannot stress enough

03:15.326 --> 03:17.767
the high profile
nature of this case.

03:17.768 --> 03:20.430
Really? You sure
you want me on this?

03:20.431 --> 03:22.772
I know what you're good at.

03:22.773 --> 03:24.203
Hmm.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.306
(Crowd speaks indistinctly)

03:26.307 --> 03:28.308
An hour on the news,

03:28.309 --> 03:30.340
and the crazies are
already calling in.

03:30.341 --> 03:31.741
Frank Rizzo did it.

03:31.742 --> 03:34.213
Traffic cam on the
overpass is busted.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.486
Next one's a mile away.

03:36.487 --> 03:38.488
Too far to see anything,

03:38.489 --> 03:40.890
but at least we have some
license plates coming and going.

03:40.891 --> 03:43.493
Let's start running 'em
down. Um, detectives?

03:43.494 --> 03:46.397
We got the driver.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.801
(Elevator bell dings) How
did I know you'd be waiting?

03:51.802 --> 03:54.804
Cop killer. This is serious
stuff. Can I help? No.

03:54.805 --> 03:58.768
Aw, come on. Throw me a bone. Taken from
the scene. Label it "priority," run a...

03:58.769 --> 04:01.711
Priority? Blood scraped off
the schuylkill expressway?

04:01.712 --> 04:04.714
For all you know, this is
half tire tread and motor oil.

04:04.715 --> 04:08.718
Maybe that's what I'm testing for. You
know how big this case is. Why test blood

04:08.719 --> 04:10.980
you know is contaminated
with foreign matter?

04:10.981 --> 04:13.623
Why not take blood directly from
the body? I plan to do that, too.

04:13.624 --> 04:16.426
Okay. Uh, the blood...
should I run it? No.

04:16.427 --> 04:18.428
Yes. You may not have to.

04:18.429 --> 04:19.829
Driver turned herself in.

04:19.830 --> 04:21.931
24 year old named Sara Gonzales,

04:21.932 --> 04:24.534
was on her way home from
the late shift at Harry's diner.

04:24.535 --> 04:27.497
She heard it on the news. Claims she
felt a bump. Thought she hit an animal.

04:27.498 --> 04:30.269
An animal? She didn't
notice a grown man

04:30.270 --> 04:33.973
standing in the path of her car? That's
why we're here, to confirm her story.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.605
Mm-hmm.

04:35.606 --> 04:39.048
Well, the first thing
I can tell you is,

04:39.049 --> 04:41.381
Sara Gonzales wasn't lying.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.782
Detective salerno
wasn't standing

04:42.783 --> 04:45.755
in the middle of the
road when she hit him.

04:45.756 --> 04:49.790
He was lying on his back. Are you telling me
he was lying in the middle of the highway?

04:53.023 --> 04:56.295
You okay?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.298
We came out of the
academy together.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.372
Rode the projects before
Joey made detective.

05:02.373 --> 05:03.773
Does he have family?

05:03.774 --> 05:06.336
Wife, Helen. I set them up.

05:06.337 --> 05:08.339
They got an 8-year-old daughter.

05:10.781 --> 05:13.583
What have you got,
Ethan? Not much.

05:13.584 --> 05:16.446
Just a wrinkled piece of
paper with a green smudge.

05:16.447 --> 05:19.649
The point of impact is
here. You can see the gash...

05:19.650 --> 05:21.921
Runs across the
shin, not up the leg.

05:21.922 --> 05:26.025
I assume that nobody knows what
he was doing out there. That's right.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.359
Well, he was run over by a car
going at a considerable speed.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.801
I can already tell you he's
got massive internal bleeding,

05:31.802 --> 05:35.334
but notice that there
is not a lot of blood

05:35.335 --> 05:37.937
or bruising anywhere.
What are you trying to say?

05:37.938 --> 05:41.941
He was already dead
when the car hit him.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.673
(Fabric snaps)

05:43.674 --> 05:45.876
♪♪♪

06:01.732 --> 06:05.034
What are you doing here, Joey?

06:05.035 --> 06:07.037
That's what we're
gonna find out.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.971
I met him working
the Christmas murders

06:11.972 --> 06:14.143
back in '06.

06:14.144 --> 06:17.106
I'm really sorry, Sam.

06:17.107 --> 06:19.008
Yeah.

06:19.009 --> 06:21.551
Me, too.

06:21.552 --> 06:24.554
So you find anything on
him that could help us?

06:24.555 --> 06:27.016
Wallet, pen, wedding
ring, and that piece of paper

06:27.017 --> 06:29.018
with some green
grainy material on it,

06:29.019 --> 06:30.620
but not enough to sample.

06:30.621 --> 06:32.862
(Computer beeps) Mm.
So what's your theory?

06:32.863 --> 06:35.865
The tibia bones were driven
into the bottom of the feet.

06:35.866 --> 06:38.428
The heel bones were
fractured bilaterally.

06:38.429 --> 06:40.399
The impact was
vertical. Vertical?

06:40.400 --> 06:44.073
Yeah, you see it with jumpers all the time.
Joe salerno was no jumper. You got that?

06:44.074 --> 06:47.537
I wasn't saying he was. He
didn't jump, Sam. My guess is

06:47.538 --> 06:50.079
he was thrown or pushed
afterhe was already dead.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.082
After? So what did kill
him? I mean, his tox screen

06:53.083 --> 06:56.546
came back negative for drugs. Well, he's
got intracranial bleeding, bleeding gums...

06:56.547 --> 06:58.948
Leukemia? Thrombocytopenia?
Bleeding in the g.I. Tract...

06:58.949 --> 07:00.920
Hemophilia?
Bleeding in his joints...

07:00.921 --> 07:04.624
I'm running another blood
test, aren't I? Now, please.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.027
(Sighs) Our lieutenant said
the mayor's called already.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.561
He wants a swift resolution, as if
we don't. So what'd you find out?

07:11.562 --> 07:13.633
When was the last time
you saw detective salerno?

07:13.634 --> 07:16.205
I don't know. Uh, last
summer maybe. Why?

07:16.206 --> 07:19.038
He's been on desk duty
for the last couple of months.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.140
Some drug dealer
filed assault charges.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.743
He's under official review.
Does that sound like Joe?

07:23.744 --> 07:26.215
No, no, not at all.
Joe wears you down.

07:26.216 --> 07:29.519
He doesn't beat it out of you.
Let's go get this drug dealer.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.952
Sam, maybe you should
talk to Helen salerno instead.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.685
Okay.

07:35.686 --> 07:37.086
Come with me.

07:37.087 --> 07:40.459
I think you should get
to know Joe before...

07:40.460 --> 07:42.562
Before you do what you do.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.233
I'd like that.

07:44.234 --> 07:47.236
And I'll go with you to
interview the drug dealer.

07:47.237 --> 07:49.969
That way, nobody else
winds up on desk duty.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.802
(Scoffs)

07:52.803 --> 07:55.875
I got three pins in my elbow
because of your dead detective.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.878
Is that why you killed him? What do you think,
I was driving the schuylkill this morning,

07:58.879 --> 08:02.011
hoping that salerno would
jump in front of my car?

08:02.012 --> 08:03.613
That's not how he died.

08:03.614 --> 08:06.485
Somebody killed him and
dumped him from the overpass.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.488
Well, it wasn't me. So what happened
between you and detective salerno

08:09.489 --> 08:11.891
a couple of months ago?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.893
I was on market one day,

08:13.894 --> 08:16.566
helping some old ladies
cross the street and whatnot,

08:16.567 --> 08:18.568
when, uh, a car pulls up.

08:18.569 --> 08:22.602
Detective roadkill... that's
detectivesalerno to you.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.834
Whatever. Comes
chasing after me.

08:24.835 --> 08:26.976
I don't have the info he wants,

08:26.977 --> 08:30.740
so he decides to crank my arm and bash me up against
the wall. Yeah, 'cause you're an angel, right?

08:30.741 --> 08:33.583
Look, detective salerno
can kiss my a... Peter.

08:33.584 --> 08:35.144
Aah! Go easy, Peter.

08:35.145 --> 08:37.547
Easy, Peter! What's
with you cops?

08:37.548 --> 08:40.550
You all got a short fuse? So
what information did you have

08:40.551 --> 08:43.853
that salerno thought
you could give him?

08:43.854 --> 08:47.096
I don't know where
he was last night.

08:47.097 --> 08:48.728
That didn't worry you?

08:48.729 --> 08:51.861
Not these days. I
figured he was on a case.

08:51.862 --> 08:54.164
Helen, Joe wasn't on a case.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.139
What do you mean
by "these days"?

09:03.614 --> 09:05.074
Excuse me.

09:05.075 --> 09:07.778
I'll give you guys a moment.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.251
All right, Helen, talk to
me. What's going on?

09:12.252 --> 09:15.024
(Sighs) I don't know.

09:15.025 --> 09:17.226
Joe hasn't been
himself for a while.

09:17.227 --> 09:18.988
How do you mean?

09:18.989 --> 09:21.260
In the last six months,

09:21.261 --> 09:23.262
he's been irritable, cranky.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.796
I tried to talk to him about it.

09:26.797 --> 09:27.997
He just...

09:27.998 --> 09:32.101
He'd just get
sullen and removed.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.143
We've barely spoke...

09:34.144 --> 09:37.777
(sighs deeply)

09:37.778 --> 09:42.051
We've barely spoken
in the last month.

09:42.052 --> 09:45.184
I started to think...

09:45.185 --> 09:48.688
No way, Helen.
Joelovedyou and Becky.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.791
We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.294
We're gonna find out
who did this to Joe.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.800
(Sighs)

10:04.174 --> 10:07.977
(Paper crinkles)

10:07.978 --> 10:09.640
Hi.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.713
I'm Megan.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.815
I'm Becky.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.717
Hi, Becky.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.349
Did you know my father?

10:20.350 --> 10:23.754
No, I didn't, but I wish I did.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.701
Wow. Those are beautiful.

10:31.702 --> 10:34.203
Did you make
those all by yourself?

10:34.204 --> 10:36.666
It's called origami. Oh.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.668
My dad folded the paper.

10:38.669 --> 10:40.670
I colored them in...

10:40.671 --> 10:42.311
Until he stopped.

10:42.312 --> 10:45.675
'Cause of work, I guess.

10:45.676 --> 10:47.947
I'm making bracelets now.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.749
Wanna help?

10:49.750 --> 10:51.351
Dr. Hunt?

10:53.684 --> 10:55.124
I gotta go.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.187
Bye.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.894
Helen salerno thought
Joe was working a case.

11:04.895 --> 11:07.136
I hope to god he
wasn't having an affair.

11:07.137 --> 11:09.398
I wouldn't know
how to break it to her.

11:09.399 --> 11:12.401
He wasn't having an affair.
He was freelancing an old case.

11:12.402 --> 11:15.875
Lizzy adler... student
athlete, penn hill college.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.277
Murdered last year. Killer never
found. Remember? Yeah, sure.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.110
Star lacrosse player goes
to team's end-of-year party,

11:21.111 --> 11:23.212
wanders off, and no
one sees her again

11:23.213 --> 11:25.855
until she's found in a
ditch in cobbs creek park.

11:25.856 --> 11:28.317
Well, Chuck foster was the
prime suspect in the case.

11:28.318 --> 11:31.060
He left the party at
the same time she did.

11:31.061 --> 11:34.063
You know, Helen said Joe had
been acting moody and distant.

11:34.064 --> 11:36.325
And then he assaults foster?

11:36.326 --> 11:38.768
Look, I didn't know salerno,

11:38.769 --> 11:41.270
but that sounds like
a lot of cops to me.

11:41.271 --> 11:43.733
Not Joey.

11:43.734 --> 11:47.307
Everybody's got that one
case they can't let go of.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.211
Anything new with
our drug dealer?

11:52.212 --> 11:55.214
Salerno suspected him of
killing a girl named lizzy adler

11:55.215 --> 11:57.947
a year ago, but he
couldn't make it stick.

11:57.948 --> 12:00.389
Huh. I'd like to see
her autopsy report.

12:00.390 --> 12:01.951
What's that?

12:01.952 --> 12:04.954
I'm not exactly sure.
I found it in his heart.

12:04.955 --> 12:07.326
Is that some kind
of stent? (Sighs)

12:07.327 --> 12:10.129
(Tweezers clatter) Hey, you
did that at the crime scene.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.962
What? Is your paresthesia
acting up again?

12:12.963 --> 12:15.064
What is it with you?

12:15.065 --> 12:18.067
Every time I have a problem, you gotta
point it out? (Chuckles) Maybe because

12:18.068 --> 12:22.171
you never allow yourself
to have a problem, Megan.

12:22.172 --> 12:25.214
I had breakfast with
my mother, okay?

12:25.215 --> 12:27.947
My hands went numb,
and I dropped my knife.

12:27.948 --> 12:31.821
Unfortunately, it didn't
land in her jugular.

12:31.822 --> 12:33.953
It's a complicated relationship.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.225
It looks like it's an
undigested capsule...

12:36.226 --> 12:38.227
At least half of one.

12:38.228 --> 12:40.830
How did it end up in his heart?

12:40.831 --> 12:42.832
The horizontal impact of the car

12:42.833 --> 12:45.835
pushed his ribs into his
stomach and into his heart,

12:45.836 --> 12:47.967
and this got caught
along the way.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.969
Zorpac. Is that a drug?

12:49.970 --> 12:53.042
It's a brand name
for a generic refillable.

12:53.043 --> 12:55.805
So whatever he swallowed,
it wasn't over-the-counter.

12:55.806 --> 12:57.947
It was homemade.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.279
Okay.

13:03.453 --> 13:05.454
There you go. Thanks a lot.

13:05.455 --> 13:07.817
All right. I'll see you soon.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.960
Got any of these?

13:12.192 --> 13:14.994
(Engine revs, tires screech)

13:14.995 --> 13:17.997
What... ow! Easy!
Three pins, man!

13:17.998 --> 13:20.429
Oh, god! Want to go for four?

13:20.430 --> 13:22.232
Oh! (Pants) (Handcuffs click)

13:30.410 --> 13:32.041
(Grunts) Ow!

13:32.042 --> 13:35.945
Look, I'll tell you what I
told salerno a hundred times.

13:35.946 --> 13:38.888
I was at the party.
Lizzy was hitting on me.

13:38.889 --> 13:41.921
(Chuckles) Oh. Okay,
I was hitting on her.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.124
But then her coach stormed
in, and that was it. Party's over.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.157
I never saw her again after that. Really?
You didn't follow her, take her to the park,

13:48.158 --> 13:52.361
choke her, dump her in the mud? Joe was getting
warm, so you made up the assault charges

13:52.362 --> 13:55.364
just to keep him away. Did I make
this up? A broken elbow? Three pins?

13:55.365 --> 13:58.367
And, no, I don't want a fourth.
Then why don't we drop the b.S.?

13:58.368 --> 14:01.470
We found a whole
pharmacy in your apartment.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.072
You've been doctoring pills,

14:03.073 --> 14:05.314
and salerno died with
one of 'em inside him.

14:05.315 --> 14:07.346
So why don't you
save us some time

14:07.347 --> 14:10.349
and tell us what was in it?! Look, I-I don't
know. He tossed my place more than once.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.252
Maybe he copped some pills.
You seriously expect me to believe

14:13.253 --> 14:16.385
that Joe salerno was stealing
drugs from a maggot like you?!

14:16.386 --> 14:19.358
Well, you asked for the
truth, and I gave it to you.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.361
And you, you're scaring
me. Well, then we'll take you

14:22.362 --> 14:25.864
to the best place that's safe
from cops... holding. Aah! (Grunts)

14:25.865 --> 14:28.537
(Women shouting indistinctly)

14:28.538 --> 14:30.970
(Grunts)

14:30.971 --> 14:34.003
(Blows whistle) All
right, let's bring it in.

14:34.004 --> 14:37.146
I know you're not walking.

14:37.147 --> 14:40.509
I'm detective Morris. This is
my partner, detective baker.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.512
Hi. Hal Davis. I heard about
detective salerno this morning.

14:43.513 --> 14:46.255
Figured somebody
would be by. Why is that?

14:46.256 --> 14:49.018
Lizzy adler... it's been
a year since she died,

14:49.019 --> 14:52.661
and he was still trying to figure out what
happened. You talked to him recently?

14:52.662 --> 14:55.364
We-we've all spoken to
him at one time or another.

14:55.365 --> 14:58.527
He was here practically every morning
for the last month. What'd you tell him?

14:58.528 --> 15:01.130
Well, he was interested
in the night of the party...

15:01.131 --> 15:04.934
Uh, who was there, what happened.
And that creep Chuck foster.

15:04.935 --> 15:08.437
That creeps says you ran him off.
Well, it was an unauthorized party.

15:08.438 --> 15:12.211
I closed it down as soon as I
found out about it. Anything else?

15:12.212 --> 15:15.344
You want to say something, miss,
uh... Heather. Heather Clayton.

15:15.345 --> 15:17.346
Heather, not your theory again.

15:17.347 --> 15:19.688
Oh, you have a theory. Great.

15:19.689 --> 15:21.620
I told detective salerno.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.622
Lizzy was a talker,

15:23.623 --> 15:27.056
especially about boys,
but when she died,

15:27.057 --> 15:30.199
uh, she was dating someone she wouldn't
tell us about. I'm not sure I follow you.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.402
Well, penn hill has
strict fraternization rules.

15:33.403 --> 15:35.504
A professor gets
caught dating a student...

15:35.505 --> 15:38.407
Well, it's a heap of trouble.
Coaches, too, I assume.

15:38.408 --> 15:40.139
(Chuckles) I'm flattered.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.973
Was it the hair loss or the gut
that made you ask? (Women laugh)

15:43.974 --> 15:46.316
(Chuckles) What are
you looking at me for?

15:50.280 --> 15:52.251
(Knock on door)

15:52.252 --> 15:55.054
Have you been in the records
room recently? It's a nightmare.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.726
What are you looking for? Lizzy adler's
file. I've been in there for 30 minutes,

15:57.727 --> 16:01.160
and I can't even locate the a's.
That's not even how it's organized.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.492
It's by medical
examiner, then year,

16:03.493 --> 16:06.035
then last name of decedent.

16:06.036 --> 16:08.037
(Clicks tongue) Lizzy
adler's autopsy was handled

16:08.038 --> 16:11.571
by Harold Robson, who, as
you know, is no longer with us.

16:13.243 --> 16:16.746
This is about to turn into
more work for me, isn't it?

16:21.111 --> 16:23.412
(Hip-hop music
playing indistinctly)

16:23.413 --> 16:25.454
Oh. Hey, detective.

16:25.455 --> 16:28.617
You got the results from that
second blood test? Uh, yeah.

16:28.618 --> 16:31.220
Then why don't I know about it?

16:31.221 --> 16:34.293
Well, I just... i just texted Dr. Hunt
my findings. Did you text it to me?

16:34.294 --> 16:36.565
I'm... I'm not really
supposed to do that.

16:36.566 --> 16:39.199
I-I wish I could help, but...

16:42.202 --> 16:44.734
Just tell me what
killed my friend.

16:50.180 --> 16:53.212
Uh, well, the
first test was, um,

16:53.213 --> 16:54.583
a standard tox screen.

16:54.584 --> 16:56.185
Turned up nothing.

16:56.186 --> 16:58.587
The second, because of
all the internal bleeding,

16:58.588 --> 17:00.489
was a specific test

17:00.490 --> 17:03.592
for anticoagulant factors.

17:03.593 --> 17:06.195
Turned up warfarin,
delivered in this.

17:06.196 --> 17:09.258
You know, it's a funny
thing about warfarin...

17:09.259 --> 17:11.630
It was originally
marketed as a rat poison

17:11.631 --> 17:14.103
until it was found
to be effective

17:14.104 --> 17:17.466
at preventing thrombosis
and embolisms in humans.

17:17.467 --> 17:21.310
So you think this is funny? No, no.
Not funny ha ha, funny interesting.

17:21.311 --> 17:23.472
Look, he died from
warfarin poisoning.

17:23.473 --> 17:27.176
But there's no way a-a single
capsule that size could do it.

17:27.177 --> 17:29.718
I mean, he was dosed
over several days,

17:29.719 --> 17:32.581
which pretty much
nails this as murder.

17:32.582 --> 17:34.554
D-Doesn't it?

17:40.260 --> 17:43.332
So you think the same
person who killed Joe

17:43.333 --> 17:44.733
killed lizzy adler?

17:44.734 --> 17:47.336
It's a theory. Whoever
killed lizzy wouldn't hesitate

17:47.337 --> 17:50.499
to kill the guy who
was close to nailing him.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.602
Hmm. Well, I finally found
the original autopsy photos.

17:53.603 --> 17:56.276
Ooh. Let's light 'em up.

17:59.209 --> 18:01.110
Uh, "mud in nasal cavity

18:01.111 --> 18:03.582
consistent with suffocation
in ditch. No evidence of any"...

18:03.583 --> 18:06.815
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.

18:06.816 --> 18:08.457
That's wrong.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.189
What's wrong?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.820
Look at this.

18:11.821 --> 18:14.123
Huh. Tan lines.

18:14.124 --> 18:18.127
Apparently, what Harold Robson
thought, too, but look again.

18:18.128 --> 18:19.798
Contact pallor?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.830
She came to rest
on something hard...

18:21.831 --> 18:24.673
Presumably a floor,
but certainly not mud.

18:24.674 --> 18:27.576
But it's pink from blood
refilling the area. Which tells us...

18:27.577 --> 18:31.310
She was moved... After she was
dead, but before livor mortis set in.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.781
So now what?

18:32.782 --> 18:36.585
Is there anything in that report
about a Mark on her neck?

18:36.586 --> 18:38.447
No.

18:38.448 --> 18:41.550
Okay, then. We have our reason.

18:41.551 --> 18:43.352
Reason to do what?

18:43.353 --> 18:45.624
Unh-unh.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.826
Mm-hmm. Oh, no.
Mnh-mnh. Don't even say it.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.631
Curtis... (Whispers)
We're exhuming her.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.644
You want me to notify
lizzy adler's family?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.616
You are so much more
persuasive than I am.

19:07.617 --> 19:09.878
Does the chief know about
this? What do you think?

19:09.879 --> 19:13.322
Dr. Hunt? Uh, detective baker was here yesterday,
asking... did you tell her about the warfarin?

19:13.323 --> 19:14.853
Well, I know you prefer

19:14.854 --> 19:17.626
to keep results in-house unless
you decide otherwise... I do.

19:17.627 --> 19:20.489
But I kinda sort of... but in
this case, salerno's her friend.

19:20.490 --> 19:23.632
You ever lost a friend?
Keep her in the loop.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.894
Here. What's this?

19:25.895 --> 19:27.896
It's a number for
lizzy adler's family.

19:27.897 --> 19:30.869
I need you to call them
about an exhumation. Me?

19:30.870 --> 19:34.343
Yeah, you.

19:34.344 --> 19:36.345
We never release autopsy results

19:36.346 --> 19:38.347
until our investigation
is complete,

19:38.348 --> 19:40.349
and certainly not in the
case of a dedicated member

19:40.350 --> 19:41.910
of the Philadelphia
police department.

19:41.911 --> 19:44.913
Our office will continue
to work with the police

19:44.914 --> 19:48.186
for a swift resolution in this case.
Oh, deftly done. Face time on TV

19:48.187 --> 19:51.260
anda plug for the police.
Glad you appreciate it.

19:51.261 --> 19:54.863
Where are we on our investigation? Lizzy
adler wasn't killed in cobbs creek park.

19:54.864 --> 19:57.866
I meant where are we on
finding Joe salerno's killer.

19:57.867 --> 20:00.899
You may have noticed,
he's the one on the news,

20:00.900 --> 20:02.901
not lizzy adler. Her
body was moved.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.904
Our only chance of finding
out from where is to exhume her.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.907
Ifwe findherkiller, I bet
that we find salerno's.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.280
After a year in the ground with
decomp and contamination?

20:11.281 --> 20:14.283
We finally have a cause of
death on salerno. Just run with that.

20:14.284 --> 20:17.716
That's what I'm trying to do.
Get the body we have off the table

20:17.717 --> 20:20.549
before you put
another one on, okay?

20:20.550 --> 20:23.522
(Clicks tongue)
Well, that's that.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.524
That's not that, is it?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.397
Is it ever?

20:38.608 --> 20:41.670
Two mornings in a row.
Must be some kind of record.

20:41.671 --> 20:43.673
Good morning, mother.

20:45.575 --> 20:48.277
Victor, did you know
that this is my daughter?

20:48.278 --> 20:50.549
Uh, good morning, your honor.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.950
He's terrified of me.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.484
You seem to be the
only person who isn't.

20:55.485 --> 20:57.826
If you're coming to
me, something's wrong.

20:57.827 --> 21:00.359
You despise owing me a favor.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.791
Lizzy adler was just
19 when she was killed.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.934
And now the man dedicated to
solving her murder is also dead.

21:05.935 --> 21:08.997
I would like justice for
them and their families.

21:08.998 --> 21:12.971
I know you can understand
that. And you notified the family?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.973
Happening as we speak.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.976
Uh, uh, she, uh, meets
the burden, your honor.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.550
She better.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.286
(Pen scratches paper)

21:29.689 --> 21:31.390
You realize Elizabeth adler

21:31.391 --> 21:34.393
is buried in orchard
brook cemetery?

21:34.394 --> 21:35.995
(Paper rustles)

21:39.399 --> 21:40.900
Thank you, mother.

21:46.576 --> 21:49.508
Sometime last year, lizzy
clammed up about her love life.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.080
So Sam's on campus now,
looking for any old professors

21:52.081 --> 21:56.084
that might want to keep an affair quiet.
In other words, you drew the short end.

21:56.085 --> 21:58.647
Oh, no. Iwantedto look

21:58.648 --> 22:01.951
at a girl who's been dead for a year.
Didn't know you were such a wuss, bud.

22:10.630 --> 22:14.403
What is that?

22:14.404 --> 22:15.764
A ball?

22:15.765 --> 22:17.366
A very old one.

22:17.367 --> 22:19.968
The cover and the
stitching are both animal.

22:19.969 --> 22:21.510
(Bag rustles)

22:21.511 --> 22:23.812
Huh.

22:23.813 --> 22:26.445
See that hair sticking out
there? That's animal, too.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.778
What's it doing in the coffin?

22:30.580 --> 22:33.522
Well, you have this
more than in hand,

22:33.523 --> 22:35.724
so I'll be on my way.

22:35.725 --> 22:38.727
Go with the coffin, will you?
Make sure they're careful.

22:38.728 --> 22:43.392
I don't want them compromising that fungal layer.
You got it. Okay, let's take her to the hearse.

22:43.393 --> 22:45.394
And you heard
Dr. Hunt... Gently.

22:45.395 --> 22:47.437
Any error could affect the case.

23:15.164 --> 23:16.996
My dad.

23:18.868 --> 23:20.599
How old were you?

23:20.600 --> 23:23.602
Lacey's age.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.476
How'd it happen?

23:28.708 --> 23:30.409
Suicide.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.747
(Morris) Are you
sure, professor?

23:38.748 --> 23:40.749
No, I have never seen nor heard

23:40.750 --> 23:43.121
of Joe salerno in my life.

23:43.122 --> 23:47.496
Have you heard of, uh,
Sarah kaiser or Anne Tanaka?

23:47.497 --> 23:48.927
According to your Dean,

23:48.928 --> 23:51.600
they both accused you
of coming on to them.

23:51.601 --> 23:54.933
Girls get crushes.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.936
Some of them get vengeful
when they don't like their grades.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.669
You recognize this?

24:00.670 --> 24:03.772
We did a little research.

24:03.773 --> 24:06.014
It's a 19th century
lacrosse ball

24:06.015 --> 24:08.016
made of hair and deerskin.

24:08.017 --> 24:10.619
Used by the, uh,
iroquois, apparently.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.521
And what do Sarah
kaiser, Anne Tanaka,

24:12.522 --> 24:14.983
and lizzy adler have in common?

24:14.984 --> 24:16.985
It's your native
American history class

24:16.986 --> 24:21.090
in which that lacrosse ball
was a well-known visual aid.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.695
You dug lizzy up?

24:26.696 --> 24:29.067
You know, "tosca,"
puccini's opera?

24:29.068 --> 24:33.071
Tosca murders scarpia and
then lays a crucifix on his body

24:33.072 --> 24:36.074
to appease her guilt. Wait a second.
Wait a second. That's what this is about?

24:36.075 --> 24:39.848
You think that I killed lizzy? You two
were sleeping together, weren't you?

24:39.849 --> 24:42.781
We shared an admiration
for lacrosse. That's all.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.083
At her viewing, I
slipped it into her casket

24:45.084 --> 24:48.256
as a memento of our friendship.
Oh, come on, professor.

24:48.257 --> 24:51.189
She was having a relationship
she was trying to hide,

24:51.190 --> 24:54.062
and, you, at the
mention of her name,

24:54.063 --> 24:57.696
can barely keep it together. You two
were having this thing, she wanted out,

24:57.697 --> 25:00.929
and you couldn't deal
with it. She didn't want out.

25:00.930 --> 25:04.733
She was planning on taking me
to dinner the night after she died.

25:04.734 --> 25:06.134
Is that so?

25:06.135 --> 25:09.177
Yes, detective. I
was out of town.

25:09.178 --> 25:11.781
She wanted to welcome me home.

25:15.685 --> 25:18.186
Robson's report says lizzy
was suffocated in the park

25:18.187 --> 25:20.989
because of mud found
in her nasal cavity,

25:20.990 --> 25:25.253
inhaled at the time of death. But we now
know the mud got in there when she was moved.

25:25.254 --> 25:28.196
If we're lucky, we'll find,
somewhere behind the mud,

25:28.197 --> 25:31.029
what she actually inhaled
when she took her last breath.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.802
Hmm.

25:52.281 --> 25:53.882
How'd he miss this?

25:53.883 --> 25:56.655
He didn't. At the
time of lizzy's death,

25:56.656 --> 25:58.657
any particulate matter
in her nasal cavity

25:58.658 --> 26:00.829
would have been
loose and uncollectible.

26:00.830 --> 26:02.991
But over time, her
body desiccated,

26:02.992 --> 26:06.064
and the foreign matter

26:06.065 --> 26:09.238
hardened into that plug. Stop
what you're doing, immediately.

26:11.741 --> 26:14.303
You just broke the law.

26:24.754 --> 26:28.056
You are the deputy chief.
You're supposed to be the hammer

26:28.057 --> 26:30.058
when it comes to
procedure and budget.

26:30.059 --> 26:33.261
Have you forgotten who
you work for? You. I know.

26:33.262 --> 26:35.263
Not me. The taxpayers.
And they're not paying you

26:35.264 --> 26:37.926
to flout regulations. We have
a perfectly valid court order.

26:37.927 --> 26:40.168
Forgetting for the moment
that you disobeyed me...

26:40.169 --> 26:43.031
Which quite frankly,
I'm coming to expect...

26:43.032 --> 26:45.934
Did you even bother to inform
the family about the exhumation?

26:45.935 --> 26:48.306
Ethan did. Didn't
you? I've been trying.

26:48.307 --> 26:52.310
What? We broke procedure? The adlers
moved to Miami. Their number's unlisted.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.944
Th-that Philly number that Pete gave me,
it's just a service. Which you would've known

26:55.945 --> 26:58.647
if you'd called it yourself
or even waited long enough

26:58.648 --> 27:01.219
for Ethan to get back to
you. So now I get to explain

27:01.220 --> 27:04.092
to the family that we violated
their right to be informed,

27:04.093 --> 27:06.324
and I really hope,
for your sake,

27:06.325 --> 27:10.328
that they don't want to file a formal complaint. Tell
them we're trying to find their daughter's killer.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.331
That'll be all, Dr. Hunt.

27:16.205 --> 27:18.066
Sorry.

27:18.067 --> 27:21.069
Ah, better that the
chief tells them anyway.

27:21.070 --> 27:24.072
But I'm gonna let
you make it up to me.

27:24.073 --> 27:27.046
Find out what that is.

27:31.420 --> 27:34.222
(Knock on door)

27:34.223 --> 27:37.956
You called me? Uh, yeah.

27:37.957 --> 27:41.189
I, um...

27:41.190 --> 27:43.932
I-I-I didn't have
many friends as a kid.

27:43.933 --> 27:46.434
I had a couple.

27:46.435 --> 27:49.097
Well, none. None, really.

27:49.098 --> 27:53.241
Um, but I had a-a
Guinea pig named Kenny.

27:53.242 --> 27:56.705
And, uh, one day,
I left the door open

27:56.706 --> 27:59.077
at my parents' house,
and the neighbor's cat...

27:59.078 --> 28:00.678
Wait. Hold on. (Chuckles)

28:00.679 --> 28:03.081
Are you comparing Joe
salerno to a Guinea pig?

28:03.082 --> 28:05.253
Yes.

28:05.254 --> 28:07.455
You see...

28:07.456 --> 28:10.018
It was the first time
I ever experienced

28:10.019 --> 28:13.021
the death of someone I loved.

28:13.022 --> 28:15.393
I mean, I cried for weeks.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.126
But the worst part was,

28:18.127 --> 28:21.230
no one understood why.

28:25.274 --> 28:29.437
Dr. Hunt wanted me
to keep you in the loop.

28:29.438 --> 28:32.741
(Clears throat) All right,
so what am I looking at?

28:32.742 --> 28:35.984
The bottom layer is mud
taken from cobbs creek park,

28:35.985 --> 28:37.385
where she was found.

28:37.386 --> 28:40.448
The top layer is
crushed shale and brick.

28:40.449 --> 28:42.751
From where lizzy was killed.

28:42.752 --> 28:44.753
Yeah. Now shale and brick are

28:44.754 --> 28:46.825
the most common
constituents of Clay...

28:46.826 --> 28:49.057
The same stuff we found
on that piece of paper

28:49.058 --> 28:51.931
in detective salerno's pocket.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.834
Joe found the crime scene.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.838
Somewhere where
you inhale green Clay.

29:00.309 --> 29:03.171
Penn hill's tennis courts.

29:03.172 --> 29:06.114
Hey, detective?

29:06.115 --> 29:07.946
Yeah?

29:07.947 --> 29:10.920
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.057
The party was in the
field house over there.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.059
And lizzy's dorm was over there.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.061
Tennis courts are
right in the middle.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.333
It's the perfect place
for someone to jump her.

29:25.334 --> 29:27.265
Chuck foster or the professor?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.938
It wasn't the professor. He was
presenting a paper in Boston.

29:29.939 --> 29:34.202
The coach says that salerno
was here almost every morning.

29:34.203 --> 29:36.404
Was he that obsessive
about every case?

29:36.405 --> 29:38.406
No. But you never know

29:38.407 --> 29:40.408
which cases are gonna
hit you the hardest.

29:40.409 --> 29:43.411
He had a daughter himself. Yeah, but if
I had a daughter and I was on this case,

29:43.412 --> 29:47.215
I'd want to be tucking her in
every night. What are you thinking?

29:47.216 --> 29:50.258
I'm just wondering why a
loving father and husband

29:50.259 --> 29:53.361
becomes moody and withdrawn,
stops talking to his wife,

29:53.362 --> 29:55.793
and stops making
origami for his daughter.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.066
He was frustrated.
Yeah, I'm frustrated, too,

29:58.067 --> 30:01.230
but I'd be folding that
paper every day if I could.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.907
I gotta get to the lab.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.539
(Elevator bell dings)

30:18.417 --> 30:20.018
(Clicking keyboard keys)

30:20.019 --> 30:22.250
I loaded Joe's
neuropathology results.

30:22.251 --> 30:24.252
You looking for
something in particular?

30:24.253 --> 30:26.855
Run a d.N.A. Test for
c.A.G. Trinucleotide repeats

30:26.856 --> 30:28.256
in chromosome four.

30:28.257 --> 30:31.329
You know this has
nothing to do with the case.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.863
This man has a wife and daughter
who think he abandoned them.

30:34.864 --> 30:38.236
If it was your father, wouldn't
you want to know different?

30:38.237 --> 30:41.110
(Sighs)

30:50.519 --> 30:53.181
(Folder clatters)

30:53.182 --> 30:55.283
What are you doing?

30:55.284 --> 30:58.256
I spoke with the adlers.
They gave their blessing.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.929
(Sighs) You didn't
think to tell me that?

31:00.930 --> 31:03.431
Hmm. How's that feel?

31:03.432 --> 31:04.563
(Chuckles)

31:07.997 --> 31:09.998
You know, I remember this case.

31:09.999 --> 31:13.041
I... I remember her parents.

31:13.042 --> 31:16.044
They were so distraught, they
couldn't even look at the body.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.876
They had to ask a friend.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.878
We're more alike
than you think, Megan.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.452
I just follow the rules.

31:27.286 --> 31:30.019
So you with me on this or not?

31:43.272 --> 31:45.303
Body presents with a
consistent fungal layer

31:45.304 --> 31:48.076
due to interment over
the course of a year,

31:48.077 --> 31:50.579
minimal decomposition, and...

31:53.142 --> 31:57.016
Conspicuous absence of
fungus on the nape of the neck.

32:01.120 --> 32:04.993
Some kind of antifungal agent?
I can't make out the shape.

32:04.994 --> 32:06.325
Hold on.

32:11.060 --> 32:14.232
(Spritzes)

32:14.233 --> 32:16.605
Is that what I think it is?

32:18.267 --> 32:20.339
The hand of her killer.

32:32.681 --> 32:35.454
Our lieutenant said you
had something for us to see.

32:39.088 --> 32:41.229
A hand?

32:41.230 --> 32:42.630
How is that possible?

32:42.631 --> 32:46.534
Lizzy was pushed down
and suffocated from behind.

32:46.535 --> 32:50.668
Whoever killed her was wearing
some kind of antifungal agent.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.701
The previous m.E. Had
no reason to look for it,

32:53.702 --> 32:55.473
but after a year,

32:55.474 --> 32:59.407
it has given us a
hand impression

32:59.408 --> 33:02.410
surrounded by the
fungus on the body.

33:02.411 --> 33:05.553
An antifungal agent?
Like, for athlete's foot?

33:05.554 --> 33:09.517
Wait a minute. There's
more. Look at the impression.

33:09.518 --> 33:12.591
What don't you see?

33:15.424 --> 33:16.764
A finger's missing.

33:16.765 --> 33:19.367
And at the end of
that missing finger

33:19.368 --> 33:23.071
is a small little
perpendicular scratch.

33:23.072 --> 33:25.704
A finger splint.

33:27.536 --> 33:30.208
(Kate) And then look at this.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.081
These pictures scroll
backwards through time.

33:33.082 --> 33:36.344
Fall season...

33:36.345 --> 33:40.688
Spring... and then the
end of the regular season,

33:40.689 --> 33:43.421
right before the
national play-offs.

33:43.422 --> 33:46.155
And if we zoom in...

33:48.627 --> 33:51.359
I'll be damned.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.363
(Women shouting indistinctly)

33:59.238 --> 34:01.139
(Peter) Hantavirus.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.141
(Shouting continues)

34:03.142 --> 34:04.542
(Whistle blows)

34:04.543 --> 34:07.645
(Coach baker) All
right, let's bring it in.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.778
Detectives. Something
else we can help you with?

34:10.779 --> 34:12.780
We need to talk
to Heather Clayton.

34:12.781 --> 34:17.085
Okay. Uh, all right, the
rest of you, running drills.

34:17.086 --> 34:18.786
Come on. Let's go.

34:18.787 --> 34:20.258
Yeah?

34:20.259 --> 34:22.660
How'd you break your
finger last season, Heather?

34:22.661 --> 34:25.393
Uh, in practice.
A girl ran into me.

34:25.394 --> 34:27.765
Lizzy adler? It was an
accident. It happens.

34:27.766 --> 34:31.099
Did you also split your
fingernail? Wait. Hold on a minute.

34:31.100 --> 34:34.802
Excuse me. What's with all
these questions? Hit him, Peter.

34:34.803 --> 34:36.804
I'm sorry. What? Hit him.

34:36.805 --> 34:40.508
Lady, I don't know who you are,
but... do I have to do everything myself?

34:40.509 --> 34:43.511
Hey! Dr. Hunt, what
the hell are you doing?

34:43.512 --> 34:46.114
My job. Heather,
after the party,

34:46.115 --> 34:48.416
you followed lizzy back
to her dorm, didn't you?

34:48.417 --> 34:50.658
You were mad at
her. You were angry

34:50.659 --> 34:52.790
that she broke your finger
and blew your chances

34:52.791 --> 34:55.393
at the tournament. You
were also wearing... Heather!

34:55.394 --> 34:57.425
Antifungal cream for your
fingernail. Heather, get off!

34:57.426 --> 35:00.568
Not till you say you're sorry! It was
on both of your hands, and it rubbed off

35:00.569 --> 35:02.870
on lizzy's neck when
you held her facedown.

35:02.871 --> 35:04.472
What you didn't realize is,

35:04.473 --> 35:06.804
you were constricting
blood to her brain

35:06.805 --> 35:09.707
at the same time you were
compressing her chest. Lizzy!

35:09.708 --> 35:11.840
And when you finally
let go, it was too late.

35:14.183 --> 35:16.884
Whose idea was
it to cover it up?

35:16.885 --> 35:20.418
Don't say a word, Heather. She
couldn't move the body by herself.

35:20.419 --> 35:24.352
It was you, coach, wasn't it? Yeah,
you know, you're just making this all up.

35:24.353 --> 35:27.595
Do you have a rodent
problem? What?

35:27.596 --> 35:29.597
Hantavirus is
carried by rodents.

35:29.598 --> 35:32.730
Rodents are killed by warfarin,
otherwise known as rat poison.

35:32.731 --> 35:36.404
Have you been putting rat poison around your
field? You know what? That doesn't prove anything.

35:36.405 --> 35:38.135
Heather,

35:38.136 --> 35:41.739
I believe that what you
did to lizzy was a mistake.

35:41.740 --> 35:45.673
But he convinced you
to lie about it, didn't he?

35:45.674 --> 35:49.647
And then he moved lizzy's
body and killed detective salerno

35:49.648 --> 35:52.350
when salerno started getting
too close to the truth. (Crying)

35:52.351 --> 35:55.523
How long are you gonna keep
covering up for him? Not a word, Heather.

35:55.524 --> 35:59.557
I wanted to report it, but he told me not to!
You idiot! Can't you see that she's bluffing?

35:59.558 --> 36:02.260
Oh, on the contrary,
coach. (Chuckles)

36:02.261 --> 36:05.793
You know, you look a lot paler
than you do in your team photos,

36:05.794 --> 36:07.895
and you're kinda
losing your hair.

36:07.896 --> 36:11.239
So? So you probably
thought that was due to stress,

36:11.240 --> 36:12.640
stress from getting caught.

36:12.641 --> 36:16.244
But stress didn't cause that.

36:16.245 --> 36:17.675
(Heather cries)

36:17.676 --> 36:20.448
Your capillaries
are rupturing, coach.

36:20.449 --> 36:23.281
Blood is pooling in your
muscles and your joints...

36:23.282 --> 36:25.283
All from warfarin poisoning.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.416
Those capsules that you
made to kill Joe salerno?

36:28.417 --> 36:31.289
You exposed yourself lethally.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.292
You are now dying the
same death that Joe did.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.295
I-I-I still say you're
bluffing. (Scoffs) Oh, really?

36:37.296 --> 36:40.298
Try telling me that when
you go into hypovolemic shock

36:40.299 --> 36:43.571
and the pain is so intense,
you can't even speak,

36:43.572 --> 36:45.273
let alone scream.

36:45.274 --> 36:48.306
We have 72 hours to hold you

36:48.307 --> 36:50.578
until we figure out the charges.

36:50.579 --> 36:54.912
That should be long enough for the poison to do
its job, eh? Oh, yeah, I'd say more than enough.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.945
(Morris) Hands behind your head,
coach. (Sam) Heather Clayton,

36:57.946 --> 37:00.688
you are under arrest for
the murder of lizzy adler.

37:00.689 --> 37:02.790
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:02.791 --> 37:04.792
No, you... you have to help me.

37:04.793 --> 37:06.394
You saw detective salerno

37:06.395 --> 37:08.556
standing by the
court day after day.

37:08.557 --> 37:10.758
You knew he was
closing in on Heather

37:10.759 --> 37:13.361
and that she'd crack
under the pressure. Yes.

37:13.362 --> 37:16.364
But I know Joe, and there's no
way Joe would ever do drugs.

37:16.365 --> 37:18.436
They weren't drugs.

37:18.437 --> 37:22.009
I brought him some...
Energy supplements.

37:22.010 --> 37:24.272
He didn't know they were poison.

37:24.273 --> 37:27.575
You killed a good
detective, a better husband,

37:27.576 --> 37:29.747
and the father of a little girl.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.320
Do you really think
I'm gonna help you?

37:32.321 --> 37:34.452
I've been poisoned!

37:34.453 --> 37:36.755
The m.E. Said so.

37:39.728 --> 37:41.389
Try this.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.791
(Chair scrapes)

37:43.792 --> 37:45.363
Cranberry juice?

37:45.364 --> 37:46.864
Vitamin k.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.866
It was either that or spinach.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.369
Wait a second! That's it?!

37:51.370 --> 37:54.001
I confessed for a bottle
of cranberry juice?!

37:54.002 --> 37:56.345
It leaves a bad
taste, doesn't it?

38:05.384 --> 38:07.386
Hi.

38:10.719 --> 38:12.590
Heard you caught the killer.

38:12.591 --> 38:16.364
The news has been
singing your praises.

38:16.365 --> 38:18.726
Now what particularly
unpalatable favor

38:18.727 --> 38:21.329
shall I ask of you?

38:21.330 --> 38:23.331
Let's see. We could
go shopping together,

38:23.332 --> 38:25.733
or we could try breakfast again,

38:25.734 --> 38:27.835
or... I know.

38:27.836 --> 38:30.478
One hour, no cell phone...
Sunday brunch at the club.

38:30.479 --> 38:33.010
I will...

38:33.011 --> 38:35.643
If you...

38:35.644 --> 38:37.686
Sign that.

38:39.388 --> 38:41.719
This is an exhumation
request for your father.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.092
Still looking for answers
after all these years.

38:45.093 --> 38:48.396
He killed himself, Megan.
He took the easy way out,

38:48.397 --> 38:50.598
and he left me with
his mess to clean up.

38:50.599 --> 38:51.999
Without a note

38:52.000 --> 38:54.331
and without a reason why.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.004
Which you think you're
gonna find by digging him up?

38:57.005 --> 39:00.608
Maybe it... it was... Medical?

39:00.609 --> 39:03.340
Maybe he was trying to spare us?

39:03.341 --> 39:05.012
Cancer?

39:05.013 --> 39:07.645
A degenerative disease?

39:07.646 --> 39:11.779
(Voice breaks) We
will not know until we...

39:11.780 --> 39:13.121
Look.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.884
No.

39:16.885 --> 39:19.687
Why not?

39:19.688 --> 39:22.630
Because you are
theonlyone that wants to look.

39:22.631 --> 39:25.593
Not everything is
a mystery, Megan.

39:25.594 --> 39:27.094
Your father left us.

39:27.095 --> 39:29.367
Get over it.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.572
I did.

39:35.003 --> 39:38.676
(Paper rustles)

39:38.677 --> 39:41.149
Thanks, mom.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.498
(Sighs)

40:06.905 --> 40:08.507
(Footsteps approach)

40:10.178 --> 40:12.781
I got the c.A.G.
Test results back.

40:20.088 --> 40:22.089
(Collective soul's "hymn
for my father" playing)

40:22.090 --> 40:24.723

Helen, Dr. Hunt has
something to tell you.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.670
Joe was sick, Mrs. Salerno.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.942
He had huntington's disease.

41:14.943 --> 41:17.174
It's a degenerative
brain disorder

41:17.175 --> 41:20.678
that probably went
undiagnosed for at least a year.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.850
I don't understand.
Why didn't I see it?

41:22.851 --> 41:25.152
You did. It was everywhere...

41:25.153 --> 41:27.855
His... emotional distance,

41:27.856 --> 41:30.257
his obsessiveness.

41:30.258 --> 41:33.260
I-It even affected
his manual dexterity.

41:33.261 --> 41:36.564
That's why he stopped making
origami for your daughter.

41:36.565 --> 41:39.266
All of his behavioral changes

41:39.267 --> 41:41.529
were symptoms of huntington's,

41:41.530 --> 41:45.633
and there's no way

41:45.634 --> 41:47.835
