AMY (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Heartland."

00:05.296 --> 00:05.964
 I know you think
you're pretty charming,

00:06.089 --> 00:07.173
but I got news for you.

00:07.298 --> 00:08.675
You have zero game.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.301
 And hey, did you look
at that link I sent

00:10.427 --> 00:11.469
you for the prenatal class?

00:11.594 --> 00:12.637
 No, not yet.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.055
 Amy.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.432
You're gonna have to
do that, 'cause Margo's

00:15.557 --> 00:17.183
classes fill up really fast.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.810
 I hear you miss barrel racing.

00:18.935 --> 00:19.894
 No, I'm out of practice.

00:20.020 --> 00:20.729
 It's never too late.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.855
 I'm too old for that.

00:21.980 --> 00:22.897
 Just try it.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.859
 Lou, I am so excited for you.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.277
 Thank you.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.112
 Except you are leaving
me with all the boys.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.363
So I'm totally outnumbered--
TIM: Hey.

00:30.488 --> 00:31.156
 --now.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.240
 Are you kidding me?

00:32.365 --> 00:33.658
Come on.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.661
I'm reading all the books
on pregnancy I can find.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.998
She's in great hands.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.417
[guitar music]

00:42.542 --> 00:45.587
 I can't wait to show Mommy
what a great rider I am.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.965
 Oh, I bet she'll be
impressed, all right.

00:49.090 --> 00:53.720
There's more to owning the horse
than just riding it, you know.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.096
 Yeah, I know.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.724
I already help brush
it and clean the tack.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.100
 That's good.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.727
But now that you're
heading into grade one,

01:00.852 --> 01:02.687
maybe you can learn
how to feed him, too.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.063
Think you can handle that?

01:04.188 --> 01:05.190
 Sure.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.192
When's Mommy coming home?

01:07.317 --> 01:08.860
 Well, she'll be home tonight.

01:08.985 --> 01:09.778
 Yay!

01:09.903 --> 01:10.779
Good.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.407
 [laughs]

01:17.911 --> 01:19.746
 Yes, I will let Grandpa know.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.289
He is gonna be thrilled.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.582
OK, well, here's Dad.

01:22.707 --> 01:23.875
OK, Bye.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.834
It's Lou.
Hello.

01:24.959 --> 01:25.919
 Hi.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.631
 Um, she's not coming home.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.882
 Lou?

01:31.007 --> 01:33.385
It's Dad.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.552
Yeah.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.762
Oh, honey.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.972
No, it's-- hey, hey, relax.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.224
It's OK.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.809
We'll figure something out.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.769
Yeah.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.396
OK.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.105

01:48.483 --> 01:49.651
Wow.
- Thanks.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.277
 She is really worked
up about missing

01:51.403 --> 01:52.445
your prenatal class tomorrow.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.363
 Yeah, well, she's
kind of leaving

01:53.488 --> 01:55.615
me in the lurch last minute.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.952
 Well, it's not her
fault. Contractor delays

01:59.077 --> 02:00.245
are a fact of life.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.123
 [laughs] Yeah,
except she's also

02:03.248 --> 02:04.290
making Grandpa do all
the back-to-school

02:04.416 --> 02:05.291
shopping for Katie.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.459
So it's not just me.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.294
 Amy, you don't
even have to ask.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.630
I'll your prenatal partner.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.048
 Wha-- you will?

02:12.173 --> 02:13.675
 Yeah.
Think about it.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.427
Who else would be a better
prenatal partner than me?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.470
I will be an awesome
prenatal partner.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.347
Do you know anybody else
around here that reads as

02:19.472 --> 02:20.598
much about pregnancy as I do?

02:20.724 --> 02:21.474
 No, that's true.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.267
B--

02:22.392 --> 02:23.727
 You will not regret this.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.688
I'm all about women and
their issues these days.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.857
 Dad, um, I--

02:28.982 --> 02:30.442
I-- I do appreciate it.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.611
But I was gonna ask
Cassandra just 'cause I--

02:33.737 --> 02:34.988
I might feel more
comfortable with her.

02:35.113 --> 02:35.947
 Cassandra?

02:36.072 --> 02:41.327
W-- Yeah, right.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.663
Well, that makes sense.

02:43.788 --> 02:44.581
I gotta go.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.373
Yep.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.541

02:46.666 --> 02:49.878
 [sighs]

02:50.003 --> 02:51.338
 So did coach say why?

02:51.463 --> 02:52.714
 No.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.799
She just said that Tim
wanted to talk to us.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.051
 Ah, good.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.635
The gang is all here.

02:57.761 --> 02:58.553
 What's going on?

02:58.678 --> 03:00.638
 I've got some exciting news.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.892
I've decided to make some
changes at the rodeo school.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.771
Someone has pointed out to
me that I've been ignoring

03:07.896 --> 03:10.607
the importance of
women's events in rodeo,

03:10.732 --> 03:11.983
with the exception of Jade.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.861
So I've decided to do
something about it.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.279
 Like what?

03:16.404 --> 03:17.405
 I've been talking
to your coach Natalie

03:17.530 --> 03:20.784
about cross training.

03:20.909 --> 03:25.205
So I'm gonna hold a barrel
racing clinic for your benefit.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.540
And lucky for you,
I have convinced

03:27.665 --> 03:29.417
Casey McMurtry to teach it.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.337
Casey is a former circuit
champ three-time--

03:32.462 --> 03:33.713
CASEY: It's OK--
- --a wor--

03:33.838 --> 03:34.589
 --Tim.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.508
I think, uh-- think they got it.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.634
 OK, good.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.010
Well, you're all
expected to be there.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.512
That includes you too, Jade.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.554
 There's no way I'm doing
a barrel racing clinic.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.265
 Yeah, well, your
coach says that

03:44.391 --> 03:47.602
attendance is non-negotiable.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.728
Good.

03:48.853 --> 03:49.604
I'm excited.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.358

03:53.483 --> 03:55.276
 What's been going
on with you lately?

03:55.402 --> 03:56.277
Just tell me.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.362
What's wrong?

03:57.487 --> 03:59.447
 Look, Cass, nothing is wrong.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.865
How many times do
I have to tell you?

04:00.990 --> 04:01.908
Can you just stop?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.702
 No.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.120
You've been acting really
weird ever since you got back.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.538
 I'm not acting weird.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.455
Look, nothing's going on.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.581
Everything's fine.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.457
 Hey.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.001
Uh, I hope I'm not interrupting.

No, you're not.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.254
It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.463
Welcome back.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.880
How was the circuit?
- It was great.

04:17.007 --> 04:17.798
Really great.

04:17.923 --> 04:18.632
You look great.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.468
And wow, you're showing a lot.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.803
 Yeah.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.013
 How are things?

04:23.138 --> 04:24.806
I mean, you know,
with Ty being gone?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.599
 Well, it's been hard.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.852
It's been a lot harder
than I thought, actually.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.270
Being apart.

04:30.395 --> 04:34.315
 Well, it's not always
easy being together either.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.276
 I just came by
to ask you a favor.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.652
But I can come back.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.445
 Actually, no.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.904
Now is, uh, perfect.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.907
I have a meeting at
the rodeo grounds, so.

04:43.033 --> 04:43.825
We'll catch up later?

04:43.950 --> 04:44.826
 Yeah.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.289

04:51.541 --> 04:54.002
 Is everything all right?

04:54.127 --> 04:58.882
 Actually, [sighs] no.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.134
Things haven't been so
great since he got back.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.720
He's acting really strange.

05:03.845 --> 05:07.682
And every time I ask him
about it, it's like I'm crazy.

05:07.807 --> 05:11.936
 Well, I'm sure there's
a good explanation.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.482
Hey, do you want to come
grab a bite to eat with me?

05:15.607 --> 05:17.650

favor you wanted to ask?

05:17.776 --> 05:19.694

wondering if maybe

05:19.819 --> 05:21.821
you'll be my prenatal partner.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.865
My first class is tomorrow and--

05:23.990 --> 05:24.616
I don't know.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.700
I know it's a lot to ask.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.993
 Sure, why not?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.661
I have the next few
days off, and maybe it'd

05:28.787 --> 05:30.663
be a good idea to focus
on something other

05:30.789 --> 05:31.706
than my relationship drama.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.624

You dreamer.

You dreamer.

Well, we just saw you.

OK.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.820
OK, fine.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.613
He says it was a
business meeting.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.282
 You don't believe him?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.242
 Looked pretty friendly to
just be business, didn't it?

06:49.367 --> 06:51.536
 Well, yeah.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.664
 And he was really
awkward on the phone.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.042
Maybe she's the reason
he's been so off lately.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.585
 I wouldn't jump to
any conclusions, OK?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.295
You should probably
just talk with him.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.296
 Yeah.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.464
You're right.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.176
Look, Amy, I'm sorry.

I just-- I don't really
feel like lunch anymore.

07:09.637 --> 07:13.308
I should probably just
get back to the clinic.

 Are you sure you're all right?

07:15.935 --> 07:16.978

you can't handle.

 Yes, it sure was.

this clinic's a great idea.

busy time for me.

rodeo's in a few days.

to take care of.

if I can swing it.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.579
 Ah, I can help
with the rodeo stuff.

08:57.704 --> 09:01.750
 It's just, I've never taught
barrel racing before, you know?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.835
It's been a long time
since I even competed.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.962
 Well, you said you missed it.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.215
So this is a good way
to ease back in to it.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.258
How can I help you?

09:12.510 --> 09:14.262
 OK.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.057
I need to find a new stable for
the out-of-town rodeo horses.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.725
The guy I usually use
raised his prices.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.727
And I can hardly afford it now.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.354
 I'll see what I can do
to find you another barn.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.773
What else?

09:24.898 --> 09:27.359
 I need you to let me
run this clinic my way.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.860
No interference, OK?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.487
 I'm not gonna interfere.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.489
 I mean it.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.698
Or you can find someone else.
- OK.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.866
No problem.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.913
Whatever it takes.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.748
Who's that?

09:41.873 --> 09:43.792
 That's Morgan.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.751
 He's got a good build.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.877
We'll take him.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.429
AMY: Hey, Caleb.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.972
 Amy.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.100
 Look, I know it's really
none of my business.

10:00.225 --> 10:04.229
But is there something going
on with you and that woman?

10:04.354 --> 10:05.146
 No.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.189
She's a friend.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.857
Sold her a horse.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.067
 OK.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.568
 I need the money.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.696
I'm actually surprising Cass
with a trip to Lake Louise

10:12.821 --> 10:13.571
tomorrow.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.781
 Really?

10:14.906 --> 10:16.157
 Booked us a lunch
at the Chateau.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.617
Private chef.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.412
Room for overnight.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.287
 Wait, are you--?

10:21.413 --> 10:22.247
 Yeah.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.164
I'm proposing.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.165
 Caleb.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.041
[laughter]

10:25.166 --> 10:28.211
I am so happy for you guys!

10:28.336 --> 10:30.213
That's incredible.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.675
Oh, I asked Cassandra
to come with me

10:33.800 --> 10:35.260
tomorrow to my prenatal class.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.594
But I will find a
way to change that.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.929
 Thanks.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.306
I've got everything
planned, though I

10:40.432 --> 10:42.517
think I'm gonna have a hard
time convincing her to come.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.060
 Yeah.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.395
 Maybe you could talk
to her, smooth things

10:45.520 --> 10:48.857
over, use your Amy charm?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.233
Please.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.194
 [sighs] Thanks for
coming by and doing this.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.613
I just didn't want to
wait until Ty got back.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.198
 No problem.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.868
It's a good idea to maintain
the vaccine schedule.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.494
 And, uh, I actually--

11:01.619 --> 11:03.830
I don't need you to be my
prenatal partner anymore.

11:03.955 --> 11:04.539
 No?

11:04.664 --> 11:05.957
Why not?

11:06.082 --> 11:07.709
 I think I'm just
gonna go on my own.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.960
 You sure?

11:09.085 --> 11:09.753
 Yeah.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.838
Yeah, it'll be good.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.382
Have you had a chance
to talk to Caleb yet?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.051
 Yeah.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.595
He swears he was just
selling that woman a horse.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.306
But he's still
acting so strange.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.225
And now get this-- he wants
me to go away with him.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.562
 Well, some alone time
might not be the worst idea.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.356
 I don't know.

11:29.481 --> 11:33.693
I just feel like we'd be stuck
together, trapped, arguing.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.362
 No, you have to go.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.197
You should.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.990
I mean, it'll give you guys time
to talk and work things out.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.078
 No.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.579
I can't.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.916
I'm just not ready to hear
what he might have to say.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.547
 [sighs] So you knew.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.007
 Well, Caleb sent me a text.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.342
Said he was thinking
about asking her.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.927
But he didn't want
me to say anything.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.097
 [laughs] You could
have at least told me!

12:02.222 --> 12:04.432
I basically accused
him of cheating on her.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.059
 Yeah, sorry about that.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.310
That was probably
pretty awkward.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.353
 You think?

12:08.478 --> 12:09.562
It's OK.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.022
But now I have to
somehow convince

12:11.147 --> 12:12.816
Cassandra to go with him.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.567
 Well, if she's
going, then who's going

12:14.693 --> 12:15.777
to be your prenatal partner?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.029
 Yeah, I could just go alone.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.157
But I don't really want to.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.953
Actually, Dad offered,
but I don't know.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.247
Wouldn't that be weird?

12:27.372 --> 12:28.915
 I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

12:29.040 --> 12:32.002
but it's not the worst idea.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.045
But you can never tell
him that I said that, OK?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.046
[laughter]

12:35.171 --> 12:35.964
 Mm-mm.

12:36.089 --> 12:40.635
[laughs]

12:40.760 --> 12:41.678
 Hey, Georgie, come on.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.595
We gotta go.

12:42.721 --> 12:43.555
Hi.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.056
 Tim.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.392
 Amy, are those your
prenatal vitamins?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.852
 Yeah, why?

12:48.977 --> 12:49.978
 You should be taking
those in the evening.

12:50.103 --> 12:50.979
That's the best
time to absorb iron.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.439
 [sighs]

12:52.564 --> 12:53.648
 And I hope you ate
something before you take them

12:53.773 --> 12:54.733
because of your fussy stomach.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.526
 Would you give it a rest?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.278
She knows what she's doing.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.447
 At this point, it's enough if
I even remember to take them.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.531
 Baby brain.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.282
That's what that's called.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.241
Baby brain.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.451
Yeah, don't worry about that.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.287
It's completely natural.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.247
Georgie!

13:09.372 --> 13:10.623
 Hey, Dad.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.000
I know you're busy.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.752
But if you're still
available to come

13:13.877 --> 13:16.838
with me to be my prenatal
partner, I would appreciate it.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.423
 Cass didn't work out?

13:18.548 --> 13:20.717
 I've just been thinking
about what you said.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.510
And it was sweet.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.762
So I've changed my mind.

13:23.887 --> 13:24.929
I would love you
to be my partner.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.514
 Yeah, I guess.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.808
I could shuffle my schedule
around, make it work.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.101
 Thank you.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.437
 OK, well, I better
check on Katie.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.938
We got to get going.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.273
 Hope you can handle it, Jack.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.483
Things have changed
a lot since the days

13:36.608 --> 13:37.776
of the one-room schoolhouse.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.361
 I got Lou's list.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.236
It's right here.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.237
Everything's under control.

13:41.363 --> 13:41.988
 All right.

13:42.113 --> 13:42.989
Good luck with that.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.699
 Hey, sorry I slept in.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.909
Katie snuck in
with me last night.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.369
So I didn't get any sleep.
- It's OK.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.495
It's all right.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.372
I just don't want to
keep Casey waiting.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.331
Here, you drive.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.127
Georgie.

13:56.252 --> 13:56.920
 Uh, yeah.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.546
Um, sorry.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.631
I don't feel like it.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.590
 Wow.

14:00.715 --> 14:01.841
Wonders never cease.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.468
Come on.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.011
 Hey, have fun today.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.931
You're gonna love it!

14:08.056 --> 14:09.057
 Oh, great.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.350
Could this day get any worse?

14:10.475 --> 14:11.393
 Hey there.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.731
You two taking the clinic?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.358
 Yeah.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.318
Tim says it'll improve
my balance and stability.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.236
 Does he now?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.696
 Yeah, so you better watch out.

14:22.821 --> 14:23.655
 Clay, come on.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.656
Get those barrels set up.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.199
Things are gonna start.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.034
 Yeah, so keep your eyes
peeled, because Camelot

14:28.159 --> 14:30.412
and I are gonna
crush this course.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.539
Come on!

14:32.664 --> 14:33.832
 Who's this?

14:33.957 --> 14:35.834
He's so handsome.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.043
 This is Morgan.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.169
This is your horse
for the clinic.

14:38.294 --> 14:38.878
 Aww.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.880
Hi, bud.

14:41.006 --> 14:45.802
[laughs]

14:45.927 --> 14:46.928
 Hey, Caleb.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.851
[sighs]

14:52.976 --> 14:54.602
 I just picked it up.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.104
Kind of freaking out right now.

14:56.229 --> 15:01.776
[laughs] At first, I
thought she'd like it.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.112
Now, I'm not so sure.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.572
 Caleb, it's beautiful.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.949
She's gonna love it.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.911
 Yeah, if I can just get her
to go to Lake Louise with me.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.621
 I don't know what to tell you.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.957
I tried, but.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.625
 Come on, Amy.

15:17.751 --> 15:21.212
If she's refusing to go,
and she won't listen to me,

15:21.338 --> 15:22.714
just i-- invite her over.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.257
I can get the bags packed.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.425
- [laughs]
- Come on.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.551
You're you.

15:26.676 --> 15:27.886
I know you can
think of something.

15:28.011 --> 15:33.683
[laughs] It's just
after everything

15:33.808 --> 15:40.482
that happened with Ash, I
didn't think I'd ever, you know,

15:40.607 --> 15:42.984
again.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.779
Then I met Cass.

15:45.904 --> 15:46.946
Everything changed.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.951
I just want everything
to be perfect.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.749
 OK, you win .

15:57.874 --> 16:00.251
I'm not sure what else I can
say to her, but I'll try.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.554
 Good clean run, Olivia.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.430
OK, Georgie.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.016
You're up.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.518
[kissing noises]

16:16.643 --> 16:18.687
TIM: Come on, Georgie.

16:18.812 --> 16:19.646
Looking good!

16:22.982 --> 16:23.900
[horse neighing]

16:24.025 --> 16:25.068
CASEY: That's OK.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.027
That's OK.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.153
Just take it easy.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.373
Good job.

16:42.293 --> 16:43.920
 Hey, just so you
know, hitting a barrel

16:44.045 --> 16:44.963
is a five-second penalty.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.798
 I know that.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.633
 Forget her.

16:48.758 --> 16:49.843
Are you OK?

16:49.968 --> 16:51.177
You looked kind
of off out there.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.846
 I don't know what's wrong.

16:52.971 --> 16:56.725
 Well, I'm sure you'll
get the hang of it.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.018
 He's smirking at me.

16:58.143 --> 16:58.935
 Who?

16:59.060 --> 16:59.853
 Who else?

16:59.978 --> 17:00.979
Clay.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.814
I'm pretty sure he's mocking me.

17:02.939 --> 17:03.857
 Uh.

17:03.982 --> 17:04.733
CASEY: All right, Jade.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.192
You're up.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.153
I want everybody to
take it slower too, OK?

17:08.278 --> 17:09.069
 Not too slow, though.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.406
It's a timed event, so.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.242
CASEY: Remember what
we talked about?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.036
 No offense, but you
actually haven't had a lot

17:16.161 --> 17:17.412
of experience teaching kids.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.497
There's, uh, certain
methods that work.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.457
You want to challenge them.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.750
You want to inspire them.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.709
You don't want them
to lose interest.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.085
They get bored, so.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.753
 But they need to
learn the basics.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.255
It's easy to get
sloppy in the saddle.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.715
It'll cost them time.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.300
 Well, you don't want to
over-complicate things.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.176
It's barrel racing.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.052
How hard is it?

17:32.177 --> 17:34.596
 Excuse me?

17:34.721 --> 17:35.597
TIM: Well-- [stammers]

17:35.722 --> 17:38.016
CASEY: Good job, Jade!

17:38.141 --> 17:38.933
 No, what I meant--

17:39.059 --> 17:39.976
 No, you've said enough.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.436
OK?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.229
If you want this to
work, you have to leave.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.273
 Well, I can't, because
it's my rodeo school

17:45.398 --> 17:46.441
and I'm hosting a clinic.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.734
 But you also asked
me to teach it.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.319
You said I could do
it any way I wanted.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.653
My hands are already full.

17:50.779 --> 17:51.613
These girls don't
even want to be here.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.156
 Just trying to help.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.115
 Yes, I can tell.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.742
Thank you.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.911
I can handle it.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.746
 OK.

17:59.871 --> 18:00.789
I'll leave.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.171
 You're breaking up with him?

18:08.296 --> 18:10.799
 He's just not
being honest with me.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.219
 Don't you think he
deserves another chance?

18:14.344 --> 18:18.765
 Last night, his phone rang,
and he wouldn't pick it up.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.433
He said it wasn't important.

18:20.558 --> 18:24.145
And I'm not proud of this,
but I couldn't stand it.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.148
So I checked his phone.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.608
And it was locked.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.151
 Yeah, but there could
be lots of reasons w--

18:30.276 --> 18:31.444
 Caleb's never had a password!

18:31.569 --> 18:33.488
So why does he
suddenly have one?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.323
Because he's hiding something.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.074
 Cass--

18:36.199 --> 18:37.784
 No, Amy!

18:37.909 --> 18:40.954
I've asked Caleb over and
over again to-- to talk to me,

18:41.079 --> 18:42.163
to tell me what's going on.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.581
But he won't.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.959
What am I supposed to think?

18:46.084 --> 18:52.966
I'm turning into a jealous
girlfriend, and I hate it.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.594
So I'm done.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.554
 Wait, Cassandra.

18:57.679 --> 18:58.304
You can't.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.182
 I don't want to, Amy.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.227
Look, this whole thing
has made me realize

19:04.352 --> 19:08.189
just how much I love Caleb.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.442
What am I supposed to do?

19:10.567 --> 19:11.860
 You have to go with him!

19:11.985 --> 19:12.902
 Why do you care?

19:13.028 --> 19:13.778
 Because he's gonna propose!

19:19.284 --> 19:24.039
[sighs]

19:24.164 --> 19:25.957
 He wants to marry me?

19:26.082 --> 19:27.250
 [sighs]

19:27.375 --> 19:30.712
 That's why he's
been acting like this?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.965
Oh my God.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.091
Oh my God!

19:35.216 --> 19:36.051
Oh my God!

19:36.176 --> 19:37.052
He's proposing?

19:37.177 --> 19:38.386
He's gonna propose to me?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.722
 I-- I can't believe
I ruined the surprise.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.349
It's my baby brain at work.
I shouldn't have told you.

19:42.474 --> 19:43.641
- No!
- I'm sorry.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.852
 No, no no, you just
made me so happy!

19:45.977 --> 19:47.145
Don't apologize.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.521
 Yeah, you might be happy.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.274
But Caleb is gonna kill me.

19:51.399 --> 19:55.737
 Well, who says
Caleb has to find out?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.656
[laughs] See you later!

20:01.659 --> 20:02.577
CASEY: Nice run, Olivia!

20:05.914 --> 20:06.706
All right.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.626
You're up, Georgie.

20:09.751 --> 20:13.421
 See if you can make it past
the first barrel this time.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.216
[sighs]

20:16.341 --> 20:18.843
 And take your time.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.929
Control is just as
important as speed.

20:24.015 --> 20:24.766
[horse neighing]

20:24.891 --> 20:25.767
 Morgan!

20:27.686 --> 20:28.436
Hey!

20:28.561 --> 20:30.230
Whoa!

20:30.355 --> 20:31.231
[groans]

20:31.356 --> 20:32.399
CASEY: Georgie!

20:35.985 --> 20:37.904
Hey, you OK?

20:38.029 --> 20:38.947
 Yeah.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.782
Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.576
[groans] Thanks.

20:43.702 --> 20:44.744
It's Morgan.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.746
I think there's
something wrong with him.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.748
 OK.

20:48.873 --> 20:49.666
I'll check him out.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.710
 OK.

20:51.835 --> 20:52.585
 Yah!

20:52.711 --> 20:53.628
Yah!

20:53.753 --> 20:55.005
GIRLS: So good!

20:55.130 --> 20:56.423
Woo!

20:56.548 --> 20:57.590
Come on, Casey!

20:57.716 --> 21:00.051
Woo!

21:00.176 --> 21:01.011
 Yah!
Yah!

21:01.136 --> 21:01.886
GIRLS: Woo!

21:02.012 --> 21:02.887
Go Casey!

21:03.013 --> 21:03.888
Go Casey!

21:04.014 --> 21:06.224
Woo!

21:06.349 --> 21:07.267
Go, go go!

21:07.392 --> 21:08.226
Looking good!

21:08.351 --> 21:09.227
Awesome!

21:09.352 --> 21:12.355
Woo!

21:12.480 --> 21:13.982
 Nothing wrong with
that horse, at least

21:14.107 --> 21:14.899
when Casey's riding him.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.407
 [sighs]

21:22.532 --> 21:23.908
 Hey, you're back.

21:24.034 --> 21:24.826
How'd it go?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.119
 Oh, I got through it.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.371
We got a lot of
stuff on the list.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.290
 I didn't get a backpack.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.000
 You didn't.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.669
Well, do you want to
show me what you did get?

21:34.794 --> 21:39.174
 No, I didn't like any of it.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.300
 Wow.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.885
You got that under control.

21:42.010 --> 21:44.179
 Well, I admit it was a
struggle to get her to focus.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.348
But I don't need your
two cents, thank you.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.016
Why are you even here?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.060
Aren't you supposed to
be running a clinic?

21:50.185 --> 21:53.313
 I'm picking Amy up
for prenatal class.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.356
Casey doesn't need me.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.774
She's only got four students.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.734
 Well, what are
you really up to?

21:57.859 --> 21:59.486
This clinic?

21:59.611 --> 22:00.362
 What do you think?

22:00.487 --> 22:01.613
I'm supporting Casey.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.323
And I'm helping
Georgie and Jade.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.699
 No, no, no.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.701
There's more to it than that.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.790
 It's sort of a test run.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.333
Barrel racing's an
untapped market.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.501
There's tons of money in it.

22:14.626 --> 22:15.585
If it goes well,
I'm telling you.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.045
I'm going to expand fast.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.214
 Yeah, I knew it.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.173
You're too much.

22:20.298 --> 22:21.341
You know that?

22:26.179 --> 22:27.639
 I don't get it.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.975
I thought it was Morgan,
but clearly I'm the problem.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.310
What am I doing wrong?

22:32.435 --> 22:33.228
 It'll be fine.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.021
You'll figure it out.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.690
 Sorry I blamed you, Morgan.

22:36.815 --> 22:37.607
OK?

22:37.732 --> 22:40.485
 Here, I'll help you untack.

22:40.610 --> 22:41.945
 I saw you smirking at me.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.697
I know you think it's
hilarious that I'm doing

22:43.822 --> 22:45.490
this stupid girly sport, OK?

22:45.615 --> 22:47.450
 Barrel racing's not stupid.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.868
I grew up watching
Casey compete.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.120
And it's hard work.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.079
She's the real deal.

22:56.209 --> 23:00.588
My parents never wanted me to
rodeo, so Casey stepped up.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.507
That's why I'm here helping out.

23:02.632 --> 23:06.261
She's always been there for me.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.763
So get over yourself.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.098
Why do you care what
I think anyways?

23:14.060 --> 23:15.770
CASEY: You OK?

23:15.895 --> 23:16.855
 Yeah.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.481
Yeah, it's fine.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.401
 Um, is it all right if I take
Morgan to Heartland just to get

23:21.526 --> 23:23.069
in a little extra practice?

23:23.194 --> 23:24.446
 Sure.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.781
Think that would be OK.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.241
 Thank you all for coming.

23:28.366 --> 23:31.244
I hope you all get a lot
out of these classes.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.120
Yes.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.246
It's Tim, right?

23:33.371 --> 23:34.831
 Yeah.

23:34.956 --> 23:37.834
What makes you
qualified to do this?

23:37.959 --> 23:40.795
 I'm a registered midwife, and
I've been a childbirth educator

23:40.920 --> 23:41.921
for 10 years.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.757
 Do you have
children of your own?

23:43.882 --> 23:45.884
 Three rambunctious
boys, six and under.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.052
[chatter]

23:47.177 --> 23:48.803
 So shall we get started?

23:48.928 --> 23:53.725
 Uh, how many of these births
would you have attended?

23:53.850 --> 23:54.893
 Dad, can you
just let her talk?

23:55.018 --> 23:55.643
Please.

23:55.769 --> 23:56.603
MARGO: No, it's fine.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.146
I welcome questions.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.148
 She welcomes questions.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.442
MARGO: I'm proud to have
assisted nearly 100 births.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.401
 Wow.

24:03.526 --> 24:04.527
 100 births.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.487
100 births.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.739
 That's a lot.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.992
 What is your position
on pain medication?

24:16.206 --> 24:17.499
 What's his name?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.334
 This is Morgan.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.252
He and I need a lot of practice.

24:21.378 --> 24:22.295
Can you stand back there?

24:22.420 --> 24:23.213
 Mm-hmm.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.130
 All right.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.299
Go.

24:26.424 --> 24:27.926
 He likes you!

24:28.051 --> 24:29.302
 Hey, you.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.179
 Hey, Katie.

24:31.304 --> 24:35.725
I've got something I
think you're gonna like.

24:35.850 --> 24:39.354
 I wanted green, not pink!

24:39.479 --> 24:40.939
[huffs]

24:41.064 --> 24:42.816
 Hey, Katie, wait!

24:42.941 --> 24:45.652
 Green.

24:45.777 --> 24:48.029
MARGO: Earlier we
talked about swaddling.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.489
So let's review.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.574
What are some reasons you might
want to swaddle your baby?

24:51.700 --> 24:52.784
 Stay warm, sleep
better, cry less.

24:52.909 --> 24:53.702
[chatter]

24:53.827 --> 24:56.121
 Someone was paying attention.

24:56.246 --> 24:58.915
Now it's time for some
hands-on experience.

24:59.040 --> 25:03.503
In front of you you'll
find infant simulators.

25:03.628 --> 25:04.421
[baby crying]

25:04.546 --> 25:05.547
 Uh, um, OK.

25:05.672 --> 25:06.673
What do I do?

25:06.798 --> 25:08.299
 You saw the swaddling demo.

25:08.425 --> 25:09.384
 Uh-- Dad.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.552
Take it.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.469
You know how to do this, right?

25:11.594 --> 25:14.889
[baby crying]

25:15.765 --> 25:17.684
 I got this.

25:17.809 --> 25:18.935
Over, up.
AMY: Don't, Dad.

25:19.060 --> 25:19.811
 I got it.

25:19.936 --> 25:21.646
 OK.

25:21.771 --> 25:22.731
[baby stops crying]

25:22.856 --> 25:23.565
 Done!

25:23.690 --> 25:25.316
 OK, it's not a calf.

25:25.442 --> 25:28.403
 We won that.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.904
 Careful, Tim.

25:30.030 --> 25:32.073
The baby still needs to see you.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.116
[laughs]

25:33.241 --> 25:34.075
TIM: Right.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.251
 What's wrong, sweetheart?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.462
 I wanted green.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.922
 Well, it said
pink on the list.

25:48.048 --> 25:52.010
And it's not like your mom to
get things like that wrong.

25:52.135 --> 25:54.179
I thought pink was
your favorite color.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.473
 I like pink.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.224
 Well, is it the
princess, then?

25:58.350 --> 26:01.186
 I love the princess.

26:01.311 --> 26:04.272
 OK, well.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.316
I'll leave it in here for now.

26:06.441 --> 26:09.319
And if you still feel
the same way tomorrow,

26:09.444 --> 26:11.946
well, then we can talk
about taking it back.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.114
That sound OK?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.300
[chatter]

26:32.425 --> 26:35.303
 What's-- what's this?

26:35.428 --> 26:36.680
 It's an empathy belly.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.390
It's yours for the
duration of the clinic.

26:38.515 --> 26:39.766
Feel free to take it home.

26:39.891 --> 26:41.309
 Dad, you really don't
need to wear that.

26:41.434 --> 26:42.268
It's OK.

26:42.394 --> 26:44.813
 No, honey.

26:44.938 --> 26:49.651
I'm here for you no matter what.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.154
 I find these help prenatal
partners experience just a hint

26:53.279 --> 26:54.572
of what pregnancy feels like.
TIM: [groans]

26:54.698 --> 26:55.699
 Good.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.242
 OK, to wrap up
the first class,

26:57.367 --> 26:59.327
we're going to watch
a childbirth video.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.496
Everyone take a seat.

27:01.621 --> 27:05.000
 [groans]

27:05.834 --> 27:07.335
 [laughs]

27:07.460 --> 27:09.045
MIDWIFE (ON TV): 'Cause
when you push the baby out,

27:09.170 --> 27:10.839
you can't do anything
to change that.

27:10.964 --> 27:12.132
WOMAN (ON TV): [moans]
MIDWIFE (ON TV): Good push.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.508
Just like that.
WOMAN (ON TV): [moans]

27:13.633 --> 27:15.135
 How's this supposed to help?

27:15.260 --> 27:17.303
It seems more like
a scare tactic.

27:17.429 --> 27:19.514
 Well, it's good to know
what to expect during labor.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.932
WOMAN (ON TV): [moans]

27:21.057 --> 27:22.600
 And it tends to elicit
a strong reaction.

27:22.726 --> 27:24.811
So be prepared.

27:24.936 --> 27:25.979
MAN (ON TV): Good job.
MIDWIFE (ON TV): Wow.

27:26.104 --> 27:27.647
Good girl.
- Are you OK?

27:27.772 --> 27:28.356
MAN (ON TV): Good job, honey.
- Yeah.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.108
No, I'm fine.

27:30.233 --> 27:31.818
MIDWIFE (ON TV): Beautiful!

27:31.943 --> 27:33.445
 You know, you don't have
to stay here and watch

27:33.570 --> 27:34.362
this if you don't want.

27:34.487 --> 27:35.739
 No, no, honey.

27:35.864 --> 27:36.990
And leave you here alone?

27:37.115 --> 27:37.699
No way.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.242
WOMAN (ON TV): [moaning]

27:39.367 --> 27:40.285
 I'm here for you.

27:40.410 --> 27:41.202
Oh.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.163
I gotta-- oh.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.414
[groans]

27:44.539 --> 27:45.415
WOMAN (ON TV): [moans]
MIDWIFE (ON TV): Push.

27:45.540 --> 27:46.374
Good.
It's a--

27:46.499 --> 27:47.334
WOMAN (ON TV): [gasping]

27:47.459 --> 27:49.669
MIDWIFE (ON TV): It's a boy!

27:49.794 --> 27:53.173
[crickets chirping]

27:53.298 --> 27:58.136
[instrumental music]

27:58.261 --> 28:01.723
[heavy breathing]

28:03.683 --> 28:04.559
 Dad, look out!

28:04.684 --> 28:07.520
[tense music]

28:07.645 --> 28:10.857
[crash]

28:11.691 --> 28:14.861
[rock crumbling]

28:15.612 --> 28:17.530
[crash]

28:17.655 --> 28:18.573
KATIE: Georgie.

28:18.698 --> 28:19.741
Georgie!

28:23.203 --> 28:24.454
 Hey.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.830
Are you OK?

28:25.955 --> 28:28.208
 Can I sleep with you?

28:28.333 --> 28:29.834
 [sighs] Yeah.

28:29.959 --> 28:30.919
Yeah, sure.

28:31.044 --> 28:31.920
Here.

28:36.383 --> 28:38.259
[sighs]

28:38.385 --> 28:41.262
[guitar music]

28:41.388 --> 28:48.853
[sighs] [sighs]

28:54.275 --> 28:56.403
 How does a pink
backpack just go missing?

28:56.528 --> 28:59.322
JACK: I don't know.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.783
 [sighs] When did
she last see it?

29:01.908 --> 29:04.202
 I left it in Katie's
room last night.

29:04.327 --> 29:06.162
 Well, there's your answer.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.957
 Oh, she swears that she
doesn't know where it is.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.458
 Ooh.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.712
Well, six-year-olds have
an interesting relationship

29:13.837 --> 29:15.255
with the truth sometimes.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.799
 Well, you're right about
that, especially someone

29:17.924 --> 29:20.885
who's going through something.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.095
 What's she going through?

29:22.220 --> 29:24.014
 Well, she's been
acting out a bit.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.266
And she slept with
Georgie again last night.

29:26.391 --> 29:27.642
She won't tell me what's wrong.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.227
 Don't beat yourself up, Jack.

29:29.352 --> 29:30.937
She's probably just missing Lou.

29:31.062 --> 29:33.148
 Well, that's part
of it for sure.

29:33.273 --> 29:35.608
But I think there's a
little more to it than that.

29:35.734 --> 29:38.069
 She'll come around.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.822
 What did you say
that rig was called?

29:40.947 --> 29:43.116
 An empathy belly.

29:43.241 --> 29:44.492
 Well, I think it's working.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.499
 So what is it that's going on?

29:51.624 --> 29:52.500
 I don't know.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.419
I'm just not getting it.

29:54.544 --> 29:57.088
So I was hoping you could work
with us before the clinic.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.506
 Yeah.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.091
Hey, Dad.

30:00.216 --> 30:01.843
 Well, Casey let you bring
him to Heartland, huh?

30:01.968 --> 30:03.178
What do you think?

30:03.303 --> 30:06.931
 Morgan's amazing,
but me not so much.

30:07.057 --> 30:07.974
 I was just about
to help Georgie

30:08.099 --> 30:09.100
get in some extra practice.

30:09.225 --> 30:10.518
But do you have a minute?

30:10.643 --> 30:11.770
Can I talk with you?
- Yeah, I'm all yours.

30:11.895 --> 30:12.937
 OK.
You can warm up.

30:13.063 --> 30:13.772
I'll meet you out there.

30:13.897 --> 30:14.856
 Sure.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.316
 So what's up?

30:16.441 --> 30:18.610
 Well, [sighs]
I've been thinking.

30:18.735 --> 30:21.446
And I really appreciate you
being my prenatal partner

30:21.571 --> 30:22.530
and everything.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.324
But you have so much on the go.

30:24.449 --> 30:25.825
And I don't need to
waste your time anymore.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.077
 Don't worry about me.

30:27.202 --> 30:27.952
This is important.

30:28.078 --> 30:29.245
I'll make time.

30:29.371 --> 30:30.789
 OK.

30:30.914 --> 30:34.376
Um, I really appreciate you
coming to the first class

30:34.501 --> 30:35.293
and everything.

30:35.418 --> 30:39.673
But I think I'm OK on my own.

30:39.798 --> 30:42.425
 Oh, OK.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.010
Yeah, well, I've--

30:44.135 --> 30:45.762
I've got lots of
things to do, so.

30:45.887 --> 30:46.763
 Dad, I--

30:46.888 --> 30:47.639
 No, I-- I get it.

30:47.764 --> 30:48.556
Yeah.

30:52.852 --> 30:53.645
 It's OK.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.355
Good boy.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.524
Amy's gonna help us.

30:57.649 --> 30:58.566
 All right.

30:58.692 --> 30:59.776
Let's see what's going on.

30:59.901 --> 31:00.902
 OK.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.910
 Not too fast, all right?

31:09.035 --> 31:11.579
[horse neighing]

31:11.705 --> 31:12.539
Keep your hands down.

31:14.708 --> 31:15.625
It's OK.

31:15.750 --> 31:16.918
Inside leg, eyes up.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.754
[horse neighing]

31:19.879 --> 31:29.014
[sighs]

31:29.139 --> 31:30.015
 You don't have to say it.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.142
I know I'm the problem.

31:32.267 --> 31:33.852
 [laughs] I thought
you wanted my help.

31:33.977 --> 31:35.145
 Just forget it.

31:35.270 --> 31:35.937
I'm taking Morgan
back to the barn.

31:36.062 --> 31:36.980
I'm skipping the clinic.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.106
 Georgie, hold up.
Hey.

31:38.231 --> 31:39.441
 [sighs]

31:39.566 --> 31:40.817
 Since when do you just
give up on something?

31:40.942 --> 31:41.776
 Isn't it obvious?

31:41.901 --> 31:43.153
I suck at barrel racing.

31:43.278 --> 31:44.654
 You can't be perfect
right out of the gate.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.448
Hey, Georgie.
Come on.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.408
This is the first time you've
ever had to work at something.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.826
 No it's not.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.412
 Well, it kind of is, at
least when it comes to horses.

31:52.537 --> 31:53.788
So what, if it
doesn't come easy,

31:53.913 --> 31:57.751
then you're just gonna give up?

31:57.876 --> 32:00.128
 [sighs]

32:00.253 --> 32:02.088
 Come home soon, Mommy.

32:02.213 --> 32:03.256
Bye-bye, Mommy.

32:03.381 --> 32:04.424
I love you.

32:04.549 --> 32:07.177
 Don't hang up, OK?

32:07.302 --> 32:08.470
Lou?

32:08.595 --> 32:10.305
Yeah.

32:10.430 --> 32:11.639
Yeah.

32:11.765 --> 32:14.893
I've got a-- I've got
a question for you.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.395
Was that backpack
supposed to be green

32:17.520 --> 32:19.814
or was it supposed to be pink?

32:19.939 --> 32:20.857
Yeah.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.192
No, that's what I thought.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.568
OK.

32:23.693 --> 32:24.652
Will do.

32:24.778 --> 32:25.820
Yeah.

32:25.945 --> 32:26.780
Love you too.

32:26.905 --> 32:27.989
Bye.

32:31.576 --> 32:32.786
 Georgie, what's
going on with you?

32:32.911 --> 32:34.287
 I don't know.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.081
I'm hitting the first
barrel every single time.

32:36.206 --> 32:37.791
 No, that's not what I meant.

32:37.916 --> 32:40.001
[sighs] Are you OK?

32:40.126 --> 32:41.628
 What do you mean?

32:41.753 --> 32:45.006
 Well, it's almost like
you're holding back out there.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.466
And I have never
seen you like that.

32:46.591 --> 32:50.720
Usually I'm the one who
has to hold you back.

32:50.845 --> 32:53.431
Georgie, what is it?

32:53.556 --> 32:54.849
 I don't know.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.267
When I'm-- when I'm running
the pattern, it's like

32:56.393 --> 32:58.812
I'm nervous or something.

32:58.937 --> 33:00.897
 OK.

33:01.022 --> 33:04.317
 I've never felt that way
before, scared like that.

33:04.442 --> 33:07.028
Least, not when I'm riding.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.488
 Well, when have
you felt like that?

33:12.742 --> 33:15.286
Maybe during the accident?

33:18.790 --> 33:20.166
 Yeah.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.711
Yeah, I guess I've been
thinking about it a lot.

33:22.836 --> 33:23.545
 Yeah.

33:23.670 --> 33:24.629
Me too.

33:24.754 --> 33:25.880
It was pretty scary.

33:26.006 --> 33:26.881
 Yeah.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.550
It was.

33:28.675 --> 33:31.636
It was like I had no control
over what was happening.

33:31.761 --> 33:34.806
It's crazy how fast stuff
like that can happen.

33:34.931 --> 33:41.730
When you think of, [sighs]
you know, the other accident.

33:41.855 --> 33:42.689
 Like with your parents?

33:47.027 --> 33:48.111
Yeah.

33:48.236 --> 33:49.029
I get that.

33:49.154 --> 33:50.196
Believe me.

33:52.741 --> 33:56.661
 Do you think that could
be why I'm messing up?

33:56.786 --> 33:58.705
All the other kids in
the class are getting it.

33:58.830 --> 34:01.583
 Yeah, I do.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.835
To be a good barrel
racer, to be a good trick

34:03.960 --> 34:06.338
rider for that matter, you have
to let go of all your fear.

34:06.463 --> 34:10.592
You can't overthink
things too much.

34:10.717 --> 34:13.594
 So what should I do?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.681
 Well, Morgan knows
what he's doing.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.391
Why don't you trust
him to help you?

34:22.771 --> 34:24.773
 Should I try again?

34:24.898 --> 34:25.732
 Yeah.

34:25.857 --> 34:26.775
I think you should.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.572
 OK.

34:32.697 --> 34:33.572
 All right.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.449
I want you to take
your time, OK?

34:35.574 --> 34:37.911
Go nice and easy, and don't
you look at the barrels.

34:38.036 --> 34:39.829
 OK.

34:39.954 --> 34:41.081
OK, Morgan.

34:41.206 --> 34:44.083
Show me what to do.

34:44.208 --> 34:47.712
[horse neighing]

34:47.837 --> 34:48.588
 Yeah, eyes up, eyes up.

34:48.713 --> 34:49.630
Yep.

34:51.882 --> 34:52.967
Keep your hands down.

34:53.092 --> 34:56.638
[horse neighing]

34:59.724 --> 35:03.061
[laughs] That's it.

35:03.186 --> 35:04.145
JADE: Go Georgie!

35:10.694 --> 35:11.486
 Easy.

35:14.989 --> 35:15.865
 That's it!

35:15.990 --> 35:18.827
 That's it.

35:18.952 --> 35:22.497
 Keep your hands down!

35:22.622 --> 35:23.456
 Good!

35:30.922 --> 35:32.090
 Way to go, kid!

35:32.215 --> 35:33.591
 Good boy.

35:33.717 --> 35:34.843
 Nice job.

35:34.968 --> 35:37.095
That's a great note
to end the clinic on.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.179
 Good boy, Morgan.

35:41.558 --> 35:42.434
Good boy.

35:42.559 --> 35:45.186
[laughs]

35:45.311 --> 35:48.857
[guitar music]

36:11.212 --> 36:12.547
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hi.

36:12.672 --> 36:13.548
 Hey.

36:13.673 --> 36:14.591
 Hey.

36:14.716 --> 36:15.884
I looked for you
after the clinic,

36:16.009 --> 36:17.552
but you were already gone.

36:17.677 --> 36:20.221
 Well, I didn't want you to
think I was checking up on you.

36:22.849 --> 36:25.727
I might have been over
the line the other day.

36:25.852 --> 36:27.395
 I'm sorry too.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.357
I might've been a little harsh.

36:30.482 --> 36:31.566
I was nervous.

36:31.691 --> 36:32.692
Just wanted to prove
to myself that I

36:32.817 --> 36:34.235
still had it, that I can do it.

36:34.361 --> 36:35.737
 So how'd it go?

36:35.862 --> 36:37.572
 Great, I think.

36:37.697 --> 36:40.408
And I like teaching those girls
more than I thought I would.

 Thank you.

36:42.869 --> 36:43.787

36:43.912 --> 36:46.414
 But running that
cloverleaf again.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.917
That adrenaline rush, it
just came flooding back.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.001
 See?

36:50.126 --> 36:52.045
I told you you could do it.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.338
 So what about you?

36:53.463 --> 36:55.006
How'd it go on your
end of the deal?

36:55.131 --> 36:57.175
 Well, I made a few calls.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.720
But then I got wrapped up
with Amy's prenatal classes.

37:00.845 --> 37:02.263
 Amy's what?

37:02.389 --> 37:04.057
 Amy asked me to be
her prenatal partner.

37:04.182 --> 37:05.934
 Oh.

37:06.059 --> 37:09.979
 [laughs] But I still managed
to approach Caldwell Stables.

37:10.105 --> 37:11.106
 Caldwell?

37:11.231 --> 37:12.524
 Vern Caldwell.

37:12.649 --> 37:14.401
Yeah, old friend of mine.

37:14.526 --> 37:16.236
He owed me a favor.

37:16.361 --> 37:17.946
I got you a way better rate.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.781
You're gonna save a ton of cash.

37:19.906 --> 37:20.740

37:20.865 --> 37:21.741
Oh, that's amazing.

Ooh.

You're something else.

37:30.208 --> 37:31.584
 Look what I found.

37:38.717 --> 37:44.889
Katie, I know you
miss your mommy.

37:45.015 --> 37:47.892
But I'm also
wondering if you might

37:48.018 --> 37:52.647
be feeling a little bit nervous
about starting grade one.

37:52.772 --> 37:56.568
You know, meeting a new
teacher and making new friends.

37:59.571 --> 38:02.824
 I'll only go if
Mommy can take me.

38:02.949 --> 38:06.327
 Well, your mom's gonna
try real hard to get

38:06.453 --> 38:07.704
here for your first day.

38:07.829 --> 38:13.168
But if that can't
happen, will I do?

38:13.293 --> 38:14.336
I'll take you.

38:17.088 --> 38:18.340
You know what?

38:18.465 --> 38:21.551
I'd even sit in the
desk right behind you.

38:21.676 --> 38:22.927
 You wouldn't fit.

38:23.053 --> 38:24.054

38:24.179 --> 38:26.473
 Well, probably not.

what you need me to do.

38:30.268 --> 38:32.270

 Deal.

 Hey.

38:39.861 --> 38:42.489
Um, my dad wanted
me to return this.

38:42.614 --> 38:43.990
 Oh, Tim's not coming?

38:44.115 --> 38:45.367
 No, he's not.

38:45.492 --> 38:47.535
 I'm sorry to hear that.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.372
 He was a bit disruptive
the first class.

38:50.497 --> 38:52.499
 Oh, I didn't find that at all.

38:52.624 --> 38:54.876
He was just, um, enthusiastic.

38:55.001 --> 38:55.960
 Yeah.

38:56.086 --> 38:57.837
 [laughs] Actually,
it's the first

38:57.962 --> 39:01.174
time I've ever had a grandfather
attend one of my classes.

39:01.299 --> 39:02.676
I have to say, you're
pretty lucky to have

39:02.801 --> 39:03.802
such wonderful support.

39:33.039 --> 39:34.290
 Hey.

39:34.416 --> 39:35.667
Saw you out there
talking to Clay.

39:35.792 --> 39:37.502
What was that about?

39:37.627 --> 39:39.921
Um, nothing really.

39:40.046 --> 39:43.717
I-- I just told him that
it was really cool, what he

39:43.842 --> 39:46.011
said about Casey the other day.

39:46.136 --> 39:49.264
And that he was right.

39:49.389 --> 39:53.268
Barrel racing is actually
way harder than it looks.

39:53.393 --> 39:57.022
 Wait, so you actually
admitted you were wrong.

39:57.147 --> 39:59.357

And [sighs] it turns out that
might not be the only thing

 What do you mean?

40:07.615 --> 40:13.246
 Well, [sighs] I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but I think

40:13.371 --> 40:16.750
I might actually like Clay.

40:19.252 --> 40:20.045

40:39.272 --> 40:42.650
 Well, I hate to admit
this, but I actually

40:42.776 --> 40:44.569
missed you at class today.

40:44.694 --> 40:45.987
 You did, did you?

40:46.112 --> 40:47.364
 Yeah.

And I think maybe Margo
might have missed you too.

 Don't sound too surprised.

40:53.787 --> 40:54.996
Margo and I had a great rapport.

40:55.121 --> 40:59.334
 [laughs] I--

40:59.459 --> 41:01.961
I know you've been there
through my whole pregnancy.

41:02.087 --> 41:05.632
And I don't think I've told you
yet how much that means to me.

41:05.757 --> 41:06.466
 Mm.

41:06.591 --> 41:08.343
You're welcome.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.220
 I was thinking.

41:10.345 --> 41:14.599
Maybe if you're not too
busy, you can come with me

41:14.724 --> 41:15.684
