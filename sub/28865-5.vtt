WEBVTT

00:07.670 --> 00:09.706
Power cells for
the ship... check.

00:09.741 --> 00:12.709
Still alive... check.
We did it, Gary!

00:12.744 --> 00:14.193
Slow down, Little Cato.

00:14.194 --> 00:16.851
The party starts when
we find these dimensional keys.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.958
- Ava, we're on our way.
<i>- Really?</i>

00:19.992 --> 00:22.340
<i>Because that's the fourth time now
you've said that.</i>

00:27.483 --> 00:30.969
Do we have company?
We do.

00:31.003 --> 00:35.560
- Raiders?
- Are you Gary Goodspeed?

00:35.594 --> 00:38.459
I'm Tribore,
the leader of the Resistance.

00:38.494 --> 00:40.461
I admire your furs!

00:40.496 --> 00:44.395
- Not you, him!
- What if I am?

00:44.396 --> 00:46.985
We have business with him.

00:49.953 --> 00:54.475
- Recognize this?!
- Oh, no. Is that my...

00:54.510 --> 00:59.515
- my arm!
- Melanie! We avenge you!

01:01.137 --> 01:02.551
Why are they after you?

01:02.552 --> 01:04.727
I wore the skin
of their dead mother.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.729
It's a long story, alright?
Actually, that's...

01:06.763 --> 01:09.558
- Well, that's all of it.
- You're a skin-stealer.

01:09.559 --> 01:11.941
I'm with the DeWinters on this one.

01:11.975 --> 01:13.252
Quit missing them!

01:13.253 --> 01:16.014
- I'm gonna kill mommy.
- No, I'm gonna kill mommy!

01:16.048 --> 01:19.673
Ava! Ava? Nightfall!
Anyone?! We need help here!

01:19.707 --> 01:23.677
<i>- Gary, raiders?
- Much worse... DeWinters!</i>

01:23.711 --> 01:25.229
H.U.E., start the engines.

01:25.230 --> 01:27.508
You can always count
on H.U.E. to quickly...

01:27.543 --> 01:28.888
<i>Engines are a go.</i>

01:28.889 --> 01:30.856
All I had left were the engines, Ava.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.134
And now you have taken that, too.

01:34.722 --> 01:36.724
Ava, where are you?!

01:38.554 --> 01:42.298
Ever since the day
I held the torn flesh sack

01:42.299 --> 01:47.045
of my beloved Melanie,
I knew I had to hunt you down.

01:47.079 --> 01:49.116
It is my life's purpose.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.533
I quit my job!
I took the kids out of school!

01:52.568 --> 01:54.120
<i>Hello, Mommy!</i>

01:54.121 --> 01:55.639
I emptied my savings!

01:55.640 --> 01:59.299
You killed the mother
of my sweet children.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.542
We're gonna hunt you down,

02:01.577 --> 02:03.372
and we're gonna hunt
your mother down

02:03.406 --> 02:07.238
and kill her, as well.
An eye for an eye.

02:07.272 --> 02:11.103
Or more like...
a flesh sack for a flesh sack!

02:11.138 --> 02:12.838
Look, you got it all wrong, alright?

02:12.864 --> 02:15.935
I did not kill your wife, all right?
I simply wore her skin.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.662
Plus, you don't even know
where my mom is...

02:17.696 --> 02:20.147
- I don't.
- We already found her.

02:20.181 --> 02:24.910
- You did?
- She's a prisoner on planet Sorbo.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.914
Amazing details
a little DNA can tell.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.951
This has been great, uh...
but gotta jump!

02:39.304 --> 02:43.964
You maniac!
I'll hunt you wherever you go!

02:43.998 --> 02:45.482
<i>Bye, Mommy!</i>

02:45.483 --> 02:48.589
See ya, kids.
Stay in school, all right?

Wow. Oh, I just want to
dip her fingers in honey

03:49.270 --> 03:52.928
and stir my tea with it.
You know, normal guy stuff.

03:52.929 --> 03:57.175
Dude, your mother's notorious?
That's totally cool!

03:57.209 --> 03:58.865
Why didn't you brag about that?!

03:58.866 --> 04:00.384
Why would I brag about that?

04:00.385 --> 04:04.355
She left when I was young. Why?
I still don't know.

04:04.389 --> 04:06.079
Pancake?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.393
Either he's distracted
or he's had breakfast.

04:08.428 --> 04:11.050
- Or I just don't want a pancake.
- Where are you going?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.880
We have to get
the dimensional keys, Gary.

04:12.915 --> 04:15.676
To see my mom
before she gets executed.

04:15.711 --> 04:17.505
- To save her life?
- Oh, heavens, no!

04:17.540 --> 04:20.541
- Why would I want to do that?
- Oh!

04:20.543 --> 04:22.095
So heartwarming.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.720
She thought she got
the last word in abandoning me,

04:24.754 --> 04:26.134
but guess what...

04:26.135 --> 04:30.552
Now it's my turn to say a lot
and then abandon her.

04:30.553 --> 04:32.935
- Chookity-pok, pok, pok, pok.
- Not now, Mooncake, alright?

04:32.969 --> 04:34.868
I got a mom to yell at
before they kill her.

04:34.902 --> 04:37.318
Such a good son.

04:44.256 --> 04:47.052
<i>Welcome to
Sorbo Super Max Prison,</i>

04:47.087 --> 04:50.918
<i>where it's our privilege
to kill you!</i>

04:50.953 --> 04:54.507
Well, just hold on a second there.
What is your business here?

04:54.508 --> 04:57.753
Oh, you know...
we're here to survey the cells.

04:57.787 --> 04:59.270
For the saberbats.

04:59.271 --> 05:01.722
The saberbats are, you know...
we got that call,

05:01.757 --> 05:03.793
so, you know,
we came right down.

05:03.828 --> 05:08.046
- Got the call?
- The call came in.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.939
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, so we came right down.

05:11.974 --> 05:13.907
Was it Wesley in the front office?

05:13.941 --> 05:16.944
It sure was.
Good old front-office Wesley.

05:16.979 --> 05:19.602
Yeah, front-office Wesley's
a bit of a prick.

05:19.637 --> 05:23.053
- He is. He really is.
- Hey! Wes is my brother!

05:23.054 --> 05:25.263
You can't agree
to me calling him a prick.

05:25.297 --> 05:27.161
Uh, well, I... I...

05:27.196 --> 05:28.852
I'm just twisting your nips, man.

05:28.853 --> 05:31.614
We do have a crazy
saberbat infestation.

05:31.649 --> 05:36.516
I personally saw a 15-footer
rip my best friend Carlos in half.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.449
Lasted for 21 days.

05:38.483 --> 05:41.624
Saberbats are extremely
patient killers.

05:41.659 --> 05:43.349
I can still hear his screams.

05:43.350 --> 05:45.283
So much screaming.

05:45.317 --> 05:49.621
<i>- Saberbat!
- Hmm. So much blood.</i>

05:50.633 --> 05:52.013
Anyway, good luck.

05:52.014 --> 05:55.466
Oh, and if they're still killing Carlos,
tell him I say hey.

05:59.642 --> 06:01.713
Gary, you thought
about this day a long time.

06:01.748 --> 06:03.508
All right?
You brewed on it.

06:03.543 --> 06:05.337
You wrote a hundred-page essay.

06:05.372 --> 06:07.892
And then you boil it down
to a small haiku.

06:07.926 --> 06:11.551
You remember it.
Recite the words, Gary.

06:11.585 --> 06:15.796
"Painfully my heart
painfully burns painfully.

06:15.831 --> 06:19.257
- It burns painfully."
- You coming?

06:20.560 --> 06:22.700
I'm ready.

06:25.012 --> 06:26.668
Wait. No, I'm not.

06:26.669 --> 06:28.290
Maybe, I should also throw in.

06:28.291 --> 06:31.881
"What kind of a mom walks out
on a kid after his dad dies

06:31.916 --> 06:34.021
and has no one to look after him?!

06:34.056 --> 06:37.299
And then doesn't hear from her ever
about anything ever again?!"

06:37.300 --> 06:41.201
- Gary?
- Ooooh... Mom?

06:43.686 --> 06:47.552
She's even more tantalizing
than my groin suggested.

06:47.587 --> 06:50.210
Well, I... you know what?
I should be going.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.382
I need to go.

06:51.383 --> 06:52.625
- Gary.
- Yeah?

06:52.626 --> 06:55.248
- Nice seeing you.
- It was?

06:55.249 --> 06:57.286
Is? I mean, re...
Really, you mean it?

06:57.320 --> 07:00.289
I do.
Now, who are your friends?

07:00.323 --> 07:02.947
Clarence!
I'm the proud owner of your son.

07:02.981 --> 07:05.294
And may I ask,
after you are executed,

07:05.328 --> 07:06.605
what are you doing with your body?

07:06.606 --> 07:08.677
No reason.
Just curious.

07:08.711 --> 07:12.714
- Uh, all right. This is Little Cato.
- Prisoner Y!

07:12.749 --> 07:14.545
Oh!
Can you autograph my face?

07:14.579 --> 07:16.443
Autograph my face!
Please, autograph my face.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.133
- Autograph my face...
- A, uh, Tribore.

07:18.134 --> 07:20.102
I was hatched,
so forgive me if the whole

07:20.136 --> 07:22.932
mom/son thing doesn't resonate.

07:22.967 --> 07:24.657
So, uh... what you been up to?

07:24.658 --> 07:28.593
I mean, other than getting
sentenced to death?

07:28.628 --> 07:31.044
So much. Shame.

07:31.078 --> 07:33.888
Never get a chance to tell you, eh?

07:46.266 --> 07:47.922
Mom!

07:47.923 --> 07:50.408
All right.
I'm gonna bust you out, Mom.

07:54.619 --> 07:56.102
- Mom, stop!
- Faster!

07:56.103 --> 07:58.002
- Will you get off me?!
- Faster, you beast! Faster.

07:58.036 --> 07:59.900
Your little pogo stick
is hitting me in the back!

08:03.559 --> 08:04.835
Arghh!

08:09.116 --> 08:10.980
Mom, stop.

08:11.015 --> 08:13.362
Hey, Gary, you don't
happen to have a ship?

08:13.396 --> 08:15.951
Yes! Yes.
I have a ship!

08:15.985 --> 08:20.196
- And there's room for you.
- Oh, no. I'd just be crowding you.

08:20.231 --> 08:22.854
No, you wouldn't!
Seriously. Come on!

08:22.889 --> 08:26.117
Sure thing... son.

08:27.687 --> 08:30.965
- Hey, anything left of Carlos?
- Yeah, he's still dying.

08:30.966 --> 08:33.313
That's Carlos, right?

08:36.575 --> 08:38.577
And then what happened?

08:38.611 --> 08:40.785
I could listen to you
almost die forever.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.510
What happened was me thinking,

08:42.511 --> 08:45.170
this is gonna be a cakewalk,
but just my luck,

08:45.204 --> 08:47.655
a drop of Yidrian venom
gets on my shirt,

08:47.689 --> 08:50.381
and... boom!
Off come my clothes.

08:50.382 --> 08:52.280
- Just disintegrated.
- Mmmmmm.

08:52.315 --> 08:55.180
- Ugh, give me a break.
- And there's Parliament

08:55.181 --> 08:58.977
watching me try to escape
the castle, butt-bloody-naked.

08:59.011 --> 09:00.772
Best birthday ever.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.307
- Yeah, mmm.
- Oh, Mom, come here.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.809
Let me show you my collectibles.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.329
Tribore, love what
you've got going on, mate.

09:06.363 --> 09:08.780
But can I make
an itty-bitty suggestion?

09:08.814 --> 09:11.893
Suggest away, hot mama.

09:12.128 --> 09:15.925
Okay... loving it so far.

09:15.959 --> 09:19.100
Did that just happen?
Yes. Yes, it did.

09:19.135 --> 09:20.610
I feel like a tsar.

09:20.611 --> 09:24.260
- Okay, so, Mom...
- Wow! Do me next.

09:24.261 --> 09:27.143
Okey-doke.
What about...

09:27.177 --> 09:32.389
- Ha. This.
- It's perfect!

09:32.424 --> 09:34.702
- Nighty-night, kiddo.
- Okay, that's a closet,

09:34.736 --> 09:36.047
but I'll see you on the bridge.

09:36.048 --> 09:37.704
See you on the bridge, all right.

09:37.705 --> 09:40.190
All right.
Okay, hey.

09:42.537 --> 09:45.023
Gary, I know you're happy
your mom's back,

09:45.057 --> 09:48.888
- but just watch out for this.
- My man nips.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.718
- In between.
- The chesticles.

09:50.752 --> 09:53.513
- Your heart.
- Right. Forgot about that one.

09:53.514 --> 09:54.583
Okay, yeah, the heart.

09:58.553 --> 10:01.763
<i>Again our power cells
are close to empty.</i>

10:01.798 --> 10:03.498
Guys, it's not the power cells.

10:03.524 --> 10:05.319
If you reverse the intake valves,

10:05.353 --> 10:10.220
you can recycle your power, like this.

10:10.255 --> 10:12.050
- Whoa.
- She's the best.

10:12.084 --> 10:13.602
- Ooh!
- Whoa.

10:13.603 --> 10:15.536
<i>Full power has been restored.</i>

10:15.570 --> 10:18.677
That's awesome.
That's my mom, everybody!

10:18.711 --> 10:20.921
Thank you for this magical moment.

10:20.955 --> 10:23.406
- Can I hug you?
- You better.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.544
Mmm.

10:24.545 --> 10:26.892
You know, this ship
would be good for...

10:26.927 --> 10:28.134
Aw, no.

10:28.135 --> 10:29.895
- It's too dangerous.
- What?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.863
Uh, it's... it's just a little job.

10:31.897 --> 10:35.694
What kind of job,
my little lemon biscuit?

10:35.728 --> 10:40.077
Well, some very bad people
stole something that belonged

10:40.078 --> 10:44.082
to someone very important.
An ancient family heirloom.

10:44.116 --> 10:46.256
It's located in
the Polyhedron Fortress.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.431
I'm gonna be honest,
this sounds a lot

10:48.465 --> 10:52.366
- like you're pulling a bank robbery.
- Well... the heirloom's not theirs.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.299
- We're just...
- Stealing it back.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.784
It's like a danger-filled
reverse robbery.

10:56.818 --> 10:59.648
- I love those!
- Good. Can you fly?

10:59.649 --> 11:02.031
Oh, I'm gonna fly so good.

11:02.065 --> 11:04.792
I'm gonna fly so hard
and so crazy!

11:04.826 --> 11:06.310
You feel this?
Feel that.

11:06.311 --> 11:10.902
That's 14 years...
of just straight calisthenics.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.904
Confident kid.
I like that.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.941
Right, synchronize the ship
with the rotation of the fortress.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.943
Gary and I will go in together.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.220
So, just uh, you and...

11:19.221 --> 11:21.497
you and me, huh?
That's...

11:21.498 --> 11:23.293
That's totally awesome!

11:23.328 --> 11:24.880
- Yes!
- Chookity?

11:24.881 --> 11:26.330
You know what?
Let me ask my mom.

11:26.331 --> 11:28.298
Mom, can Mooncake come with?

11:28.333 --> 11:32.268
- Nope. Just you and me.
- Sorry, little buddy.

11:32.302 --> 11:36.134
I-I-I can get you in.
With the Eye of Fer.

11:36.168 --> 11:39.653
- Nobody wants to see your fur eye.
- Or do you?

11:39.654 --> 11:42.416
With it, I can teleport
anywhere my heart desires.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.866
I can get all up into the fortress,

11:44.901 --> 11:50.148
and then into your mom's fortress.
You know which one.

11:50.182 --> 11:52.460
- Oh, my...
- What's going on, Gary?

11:52.495 --> 11:55.566
Can't you see she's a con artist?
They're already looking for her.

11:55.567 --> 11:58.087
If I were you,
I'd watch my mouth, kiddo.

11:58.121 --> 11:59.985
You're good at finding stuff.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.091
Why didn't you try
finding your son?

12:02.125 --> 12:05.680
- How do you know I didn't?
- Sorry, not buying it.

12:05.715 --> 12:07.026
Hold on, Nightfall.

12:07.027 --> 12:11.445
- I want to do this.
- Let's go, son.

12:11.479 --> 12:13.756
- Mm.
- Huh?

12:13.757 --> 12:15.418
Nice.

12:17.589 --> 12:21.869
Hmm. My precious pancake
vault, it's been violated.

12:21.903 --> 12:26.011
Who's in here? Show yourself
or I'll use my little baton.

12:28.876 --> 12:32.052
- Oh, heavens.
- That sweet baby angel.

12:32.086 --> 12:34.364
Seems like you're
a little bit stressed.

12:34.399 --> 12:36.884
Who made him stressed?!

12:36.918 --> 12:39.576
Have we completely
eliminated the possibility

12:39.611 --> 12:42.234
that my griddlecakes
are irresistible?

12:42.269 --> 12:45.030
Uh-oh.
I've been here before.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.550
I think he's eating more
than your pancakes.

12:47.584 --> 12:51.070
I think he's eating his feelings.
Aren't you, boy?

12:51.071 --> 12:54.324
Mm. Chookity.

12:54.502 --> 12:56.745
Who's ready for a reverse robbery?

12:56.780 --> 13:00.438
'Cause I know I am!
I so am!

13:00.439 --> 13:02.268
- Ready, kid?
- I was born ready.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.581
Actually, you were born
during the rinse cycle

13:04.615 --> 13:06.754
- of a hover car wash.
- I was? Oh.

13:06.755 --> 13:08.585
Oh, that would explain a lot, actually.

13:08.619 --> 13:11.138
Well, chin up.
You are the son of a beloved hero

13:11.139 --> 13:12.795
and a notorious criminal.

13:12.796 --> 13:17.031
Here we... go!

13:18.698 --> 13:20.769
<i>I hope you know
what you're doing.</i>

13:20.804 --> 13:23.156
<i>Don't screw this up, boys.</i>

13:38.028 --> 13:39.511
- Got 'em.
- Okay, good!

13:40.824 --> 13:43.170
Oh, nice shot, Mom!
Whoo!

13:46.243 --> 13:48.625
<i>Nice working with you.</i>

13:53.181 --> 13:56.666
Out of pancakes again.
They're selling like...

13:56.667 --> 14:00.498
- Never mind.
- Mm. Chookity.

14:00.499 --> 14:03.295
Mm...

14:03.329 --> 14:05.780
Uh, I have an idea.

14:05.814 --> 14:08.161
But it all depends
on whether we have...

14:08.196 --> 14:10.591
folding chairs.

14:16.653 --> 14:22.175
Hey, little buddy.
I think you know why we're here.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.454
It's an intervention.

14:26.179 --> 14:30.080
- That's the vault!
- Squeezy walls... of course!

14:30.114 --> 14:31.770
It's all right.
We've got this.

14:31.771 --> 14:35.118
- Hang on.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

14:35.119 --> 14:36.983
Oh, my!
The gate is closing!

14:37.018 --> 14:39.537
- I can see that!
- Oh, go faster, go faster!

14:39.538 --> 14:42.817
- Oh, oh!
- Oh!

14:42.851 --> 14:44.093
We're goners, Gary.

14:53.275 --> 14:54.759
Hello, primate.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.038
Clarence, how the hell
did you get in there,

14:57.072 --> 15:01.248
- and do not say the eye of...
- Eye of Fer. Duh.

15:01.249 --> 15:02.456
Like I said,
it's one of the most valuable

15:02.457 --> 15:06.185
pieces of technology in
the universe.

15:06.219 --> 15:07.875
Oh-oh-oh...

15:08.981 --> 15:11.258
Well... crap.

15:11.259 --> 15:14.227
Mooncake, no matter
what size you are...

15:14.262 --> 15:17.403
right now, it's around a 42...
it's okay with us.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.405
We love you, and we just want

15:19.440 --> 15:23.236
to make sure
that you're complete.

15:23.271 --> 15:27.240
- Chookity.
- Yeah! Bring it in, boy!

15:27.275 --> 15:30.254
Help!!
He's eating me ali...

15:33.419 --> 15:35.904
I lower you down to the pit,
and you snag the gem.

15:35.939 --> 15:39.810
- Got it, gorgeous?
- Our first date... Oh!

15:42.290 --> 15:44.741
Hmm?

15:47.433 --> 15:51.126
- Oh, no. Oh, that is big.
- It's a Zargon slug!

15:51.161 --> 15:52.472
Oh, that is very big.

15:52.473 --> 15:55.476
Actually, for a Zargon slug,
it's quite small, but, still,

15:55.510 --> 15:57.270
let's get the hell out of here!

15:58.996 --> 16:00.791
Oof!

16:00.826 --> 16:02.205
Got it!

16:04.933 --> 16:08.558
- Let's go!
- Ouch!

16:13.148 --> 16:16.428
I got this, Mom.
Switch spots.

16:16.462 --> 16:18.291
I hardly think the back flip
was necessary,

16:18.326 --> 16:19.706
given the situation, but okay.

16:19.707 --> 16:21.778
You can never go wrong
with a back flip, kid.

16:21.812 --> 16:23.226
Write that down.

16:23.227 --> 16:25.920
Gary, you're killing me.
Will you stop it?!

16:25.954 --> 16:29.751
Get your crotch...
Your crotch is in my eyes!

16:29.786 --> 16:32.553
- Oh, my God!
- Get your face out of my crotch.

16:32.588 --> 16:34.169
- Arghh!
- Oh, my gosh.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.810
We did it.
Not bad, kiddo.

16:53.844 --> 16:56.190
- Thanks.
- You did good, my boy.

16:56.191 --> 16:57.537
I'm not your boy.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.505
From now on, your name is Jimmy.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.300
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

17:01.334 --> 17:03.544
No, Mooncake, please don't eat us.

17:03.578 --> 17:05.477
Is this about losing your powers

17:05.511 --> 17:07.339
or Gary not wanting
to hang with you?

17:07.375 --> 17:11.137
Because you're more than
a planet-destroying super weapon.

17:11.172 --> 17:14.693
You're my dude cake.
You'reeveryone's dude cake.

17:14.727 --> 17:16.521
- Uh!
- D-Don't worry, Mooncake.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.525
If I could crack Gary's brain
open and unfold it,

17:19.560 --> 17:22.010
you'd see all the love
that's in there.

17:22.045 --> 17:23.744
And then we could try
to roll it back up.

17:23.771 --> 17:25.392
But that might not be possible.

17:25.393 --> 17:27.671
And Gary's not the only one
who loves you.

17:27.705 --> 17:31.363
- We do, too, little biscuit.
- Mmm!

17:36.369 --> 17:38.060
Mm.

17:38.061 --> 17:39.821
Chook! Chook! Chook!

17:39.856 --> 17:43.016
Chook, chook, chook, chook,
chook, chook, chook!

17:45.586 --> 17:47.241
<i>Pretty good pep talk.</i>

17:48.450 --> 17:50.763
Pok, pok, pok, pok, pokity-pok...

17:50.798 --> 17:54.560
There goes my greatest customer.

17:56.645 --> 17:59.268
How did the reverse robbery go?

17:59.303 --> 18:01.581
And don't you leave out
any details!

18:01.615 --> 18:03.479
Oh!

18:03.514 --> 18:05.204
I know!
My mom was amazing!

18:05.205 --> 18:07.138
The things a mother will do.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.900
Mooncake, looking good, buddy.

18:09.934 --> 18:13.972
- Hey, Mom, come on, let's celebrate.
- Nah. Get some shut-eye.

18:13.973 --> 18:16.147
They'll be more adventures tomorrow.

18:36.374 --> 18:41.033
- Hello, dimensional key.
- What?

18:47.213 --> 18:50.872
So, you're leaving...
again.

18:50.906 --> 18:53.978
I think we both knew this
was never meant to be forever.

18:54.013 --> 18:57.948
- Right?
- Can I ask you one thing?

18:57.982 --> 19:01.054
Why don't you want anything
to do with me?

19:02.504 --> 19:08.234
Truth? The day I lost your dad,
my heart shattered.

19:08.268 --> 19:12.031
Whatever was left was too small
to love anything anymore.

19:12.065 --> 19:16.518
Yeah. See, I would have
taken even a tiny piece...

19:16.552 --> 19:21.247
- just one piece.
- Yeah...

19:21.281 --> 19:24.560
Maybe in another life, eh?
But not this one.

19:24.595 --> 19:29.876
- I'll see you around, kiddo.
- Tada!

19:29.911 --> 19:33.846
Oh. Guess I did the
big shave for nothing.

20:41.182 --> 20:44.634
Gary! Your mother left
with that family heirloom.

20:44.668 --> 20:47.671
- It was a...
- Let me guess, a dimensional key.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.224
How did you know?

20:49.225 --> 20:52.504
She's good at taking
what's important to me.

20:52.738 --> 20:55.527
That woman hasn't seen
the last of me.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.795
It's on.
