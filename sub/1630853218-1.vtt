The palace is noisy,

- so we decided to study here.

06:01.701 --> 06:03.129
Studying is good,

06:28.497 --> 06:29.763
Dad, I'm fine!

06:29.799 --> 06:33.027
Barbara, didn't we agree

horse riding?

06:33.062 --> 06:34.930
Then why did you
give me a horse?

06:34.965 --> 06:37.867
Well... You asked for a pony,

06:46.075 --> 06:48.075
- I told you: control!
- Control!

06:48.110 --> 06:52.046
Control, and--
What am I going
to do with you?

06:52.081 --> 06:56.017
Why don't you put me
in a glass jar? I'll
definitely be safe then!

06:56.052 --> 06:57.887
You'll take me out
of the jar occasionally,

06:57.922 --> 06:59.988
blow the dust off me
and check that nothing's--

07:00.023 --> 07:01.154

07:24.619 --> 07:27.620
The book!
Dispose of the book!

07:27.655 --> 07:29.886
And tell the post office
to stop delivering

07:29.921 --> 07:31.987
unsavory literature

07:33.123 --> 07:36.024

the entrance

07:53.340 --> 07:55.978
What's going on?
What's the matter?

07:56.013 --> 07:57.980
No idea,
I saw people do it,
so I joined in.

07:58.015 --> 07:59.148
The post office is closed.

07:59.183 --> 08:01.280
They said the royal postman
was robbed in the forest.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.117
- What? Again?
- Yeah.

08:03.152 --> 08:05.757
They said it was Bogey!

08:05.792 --> 08:09.629
Huge horns!
And those burning eyes...

08:09.664 --> 08:11.191
the size of saucers!

08:11.226 --> 08:13.325
Basil, why did you
go through the forest?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.097
You know everyone else
avoids it.

08:16.132 --> 08:18.297
I was running late,

08:18.332 --> 08:22.268
Basil, what about Princess
Barbara's birthday presents?

08:22.303 --> 08:25.040
I dropped everything
and ran...

08:25.075 --> 08:26.976
Ran for my life!

08:27.011 --> 08:29.044
The letters, the packages,

08:29.079 --> 08:31.750
and even a parcel

08:33.754 --> 08:34.918
Thank you.

08:37.219 --> 08:39.758
Oh! A letter!

08:39.793 --> 08:42.794
I-I kept a letter addressed
to Princess Barbara!

08:42.829 --> 08:44.026
It's from abroad!

08:44.061 --> 08:45.962
Go take it
to the palace, then.

08:45.997 --> 08:50.637
Me? How will I
dare to look
at the King again?

08:53.939 --> 08:55.301
Ahem.

08:55.336 --> 08:56.676
Timothy, will you go?

08:56.711 --> 08:59.679
Me? No, no, no, no, no.

Something is telling me,
dear colleagues...

09:04.114 --> 09:08.347

09:08.382 --> 09:11.020
Mind your own business,

09:11.055 --> 09:13.726
junior mail sorter?

09:13.761 --> 09:17.158

09:20.262 --> 09:22.735
Oh! It's

09:31.911 --> 09:35.044
Yep. Plus, I need

09:36.311 --> 09:38.311

Oh, Barbara, sweetie!
Oh, how it suits you!

09:49.324 --> 09:50.994
Quite the blushing bride!

09:51.029 --> 09:53.326
Bride? You moron!
She's not getting married!

09:53.361 --> 09:55.196
I said the dress was pretty
and you're calling me a moron.

09:55.231 --> 09:57.066
- You're a moron yourself.
- What are you talking about?

09:57.101 --> 09:59.002
You said "bride"
and that was ridiculous!

09:59.037 --> 10:01.741
Pedro, the dress
fits perfectly!

10:01.776 --> 10:03.776
The guests
will be overjoyed!

10:03.811 --> 10:06.042
I'm the only one
who's not allowed
to be overjoyed.

10:06.077 --> 10:09.815
It's too dangerous!
I could explode
if I get overjoyed!

10:09.850 --> 10:12.312
This stupid dress is
from the last century.

10:12.347 --> 10:14.281
Who am I supposed
to be impersonating?

10:14.316 --> 10:17.218
His Majesty insisted
on this particular dress.

10:17.253 --> 10:20.089
Well, in that case,
let<i> him</i> wear it!

10:20.124 --> 10:22.993
Your Highness,
such behavior
is unacceptable.

10:23.028 --> 10:26.293
I shall have
to report this
to His Majesty.

10:26.328 --> 10:27.228
Oh!

10:28.396 --> 10:30.770
Ugh... What a nightmare.

10:30.805 --> 10:32.464
- What's that noise?

10:32.499 --> 10:35.005
"Motrosickle" it's called.
I read about it in a magazine.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.172
The royal mail
has arrived!

10:37.207 --> 10:39.339
The mail!
At last!

10:39.374 --> 10:42.914
No mail for you! Those are
His Majesty's orders!

10:45.512 --> 10:48.986
Your Highness,
I demand that you--

10:50.418 --> 10:52.055
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

10:53.421 --> 10:54.827
At last! At last!
At last!

10:56.490 --> 10:57.731
Woo-hoo!

10:58.965 --> 11:01.966
Hi, Basil! Did you
bring me a new book?

11:02.001 --> 11:03.165
Howdy.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.969
Oh... Hello.

11:05.004 --> 11:06.432
Are you doing Basil's shift?

11:06.467 --> 11:09.006
Sure. And here's
a letter for you,
Your Highness.

11:09.041 --> 11:11.107
From some prince...

11:11.142 --> 11:12.339
Prince Edward?!

11:12.374 --> 11:14.847
Ahem, Prince Edward?

11:16.983 --> 11:19.753
You look even better
in real life
than in pictures.

11:19.788 --> 11:22.822
That's a very inappropriate
thing to say.

11:22.857 --> 11:24.758
Anyways, I can't pay
for your services now.

11:24.793 --> 11:25.858
I'm all dressed up,
you see?

11:26.861 --> 11:29.994
You can't possibly
buy my silence

11:30.029 --> 11:33.129
- Excuse me?
- I know everything.

11:33.164 --> 11:35.362
- What?
- Everything
a junior mail sorter

11:35.397 --> 11:37.199
can possibly know.

11:37.234 --> 11:40.972
"Oh, Prince Edward,
save me from this
claustrophobic prison,

11:41.007 --> 11:43.205
and from my father,
who doesn't let me breathe!"

11:43.240 --> 11:44.943
Have you been
reading my letters?!

11:44.978 --> 11:47.110
"Dear Barbara,
I can't wait to see you.

11:47.145 --> 11:48.540
I long to embrace you

11:48.575 --> 11:50.509
- and whisper sweet love
in your ear."

11:52.150 --> 11:53.787
You don't want
your royal daddy

11:53.822 --> 11:55.789
to find out
about all of this,
do you?

11:55.824 --> 11:57.791
What? What do you
want from me?!

11:57.826 --> 12:01.025
Well, let's start
with a royal kiss.

12:01.995 --> 12:03.522
How dare you?! You--

12:03.557 --> 12:05.832
You know what you are?
You're a weasel!

12:05.867 --> 12:08.329
