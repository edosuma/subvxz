Man, who farted?

00:36.756 --> 00:39.358
What the...?

00:39.426 --> 00:40.459
It's motor oil.

00:40.527 --> 00:43.229
That's right.

00:43.296 --> 00:44.797
Motor oil.

00:44.864 --> 00:46.465
And this is
a lighter.

Look, I know what you did,
I know what you took,

00:52.405 --> 00:53.806
so give it to me.

00:53.873 --> 00:56.575
How do you know that, space man?

00:56.643 --> 00:58.677
Nobody knows about that.

00:58.745 --> 01:00.746
Now, get your ass out of here.

If it's in here and
you're not telling me,

01:04.818 --> 01:08.187
then it's gonna burn
up along with you.

01:08.255 --> 01:12.157
But if it's in here
and you give it to me,

01:12.225 --> 01:14.326
maybe we can work something out.

01:14.394 --> 01:17.096
Hey, man, it's not in here.

01:17.163 --> 01:18.597

01:23.303 --> 01:25.237
Where is it?!

Stand up, will you?!

01:27.073 --> 01:28.240

01:29.609 --> 01:30.909
It's with my partner.

01:30.977 --> 01:32.111
And where's he?

01:32.178 --> 01:34.580
He's got a trailer
like this in the desert.

01:35.315 --> 01:37.249
30 miles east of Kingman!

01:40.120 --> 01:42.388

who in the hell are you?

02:14.721 --> 02:16.021
What?

02:16.089 --> 02:19.525
I asked, "Did you
say something?"

02:19.592 --> 02:21.160
You're talking gibberish.

Resting very comfortably.

04:44.077 --> 04:45.577
Well, she's sedated.

04:45.628 --> 04:47.479
But, really, she's fine.

04:47.547 --> 04:50.582
I mean, there is nothing
physiologically wrong with her.

04:50.650 --> 04:52.618
Everything works, she can hear,

04:52.685 --> 04:55.154
she just doesn't recognize
what she hears as speech.

04:55.221 --> 04:57.589
At least as speech in a language
she's familiar with.

04:57.657 --> 04:58.690
Okay.

04:58.758 --> 05:00.626
But she was able to read
questions that I typed

05:00.693 --> 05:02.561
on the computer and then
speak back to me. Okay.

05:02.629 --> 05:04.596
Really, she's fine.

05:04.664 --> 05:08.567
It's a kind of hysteria,
like hysterical blindness,

05:08.635 --> 05:12.571
where a person can see, but
they don't believe they can see.

05:12.639 --> 05:15.474
I'm sure you know
what I'm talking about.

05:15.542 --> 05:18.844
Based on
what I read in her file,

05:18.912 --> 05:20.846
you've been through
a lot of these things.

05:23.349 --> 05:24.349
God...

05:26.386 --> 05:29.388
I don't know how you do it.

05:32.892 --> 05:34.693
Uh, what now?

05:34.761 --> 05:37.996
There's really no actual way
of treating this.

05:38.064 --> 05:39.097
That's why I sedated her.

05:39.165 --> 05:40.465
I'm hoping when she wakes up,

05:40.533 --> 05:44.019
the condition will have
reversed itself.

05:44.103 --> 05:47.739
She's gonna be out for
a couple more hours at least,

05:47.807 --> 05:49.274

How did we get here?

06:43.296 --> 06:44.563
It's amnesia.

06:44.631 --> 06:46.565

'cause of the sedative.

reverse itself in time.

I'm speaking to you in Diné and
you're answering me in English.

15:41.534 --> 15:45.370
Forgive me. My name's
Jane Livingston.

15:45.438 --> 15:46.971
I'm a professor of
anthrolinguistics

15:47.039 --> 15:48.072
at Mesa University.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.974
No, no, no, please, forgive me.

15:50.042 --> 15:52.243
My name is Allison
DuBois. I work here,

15:52.311 --> 15:56.247
and the only language
that I speak is English.

15:56.315 --> 15:58.583
At least, up until
yesterday morning,

15:58.651 --> 16:01.319
when suddenly I couldn't
understand anything

16:01.387 --> 16:03.955
that anybody said.

16:04.023 --> 16:06.758
Up until now.
Up until you.

16:06.826 --> 16:08.760
<i>I saw the story</i>
<i>this morning</i>

16:08.828 --> 16:13.932
on the news, and I thought,
"My God, a murder!"

16:13.999 --> 16:17.936
I thought... maybe I could be of
some help to this investigation,

16:18.003 --> 16:20.271
speaking the language and all?

16:20.339 --> 16:21.606
But nobody here was interested.

16:21.674 --> 16:23.842
Well, I'm interested.

16:23.909 --> 16:26.511
I'm going to talk to my boss,
I'm going to get you involved.

16:26.579 --> 16:30.081
You know, I've heard
of people like you.

16:30.149 --> 16:32.951
Suddenly being able
to understand a language

16:33.018 --> 16:35.153
they've never been exposed to.

16:35.221 --> 16:36.821
It's called xenoglossia.

16:36.889 --> 16:41.292
Great. So it has a name?

16:41.360 --> 16:44.963
Even now, as we're speaking,
you have no awareness

16:45.030 --> 16:47.065
that I'm speaking
to you in Diné?

16:47.132 --> 16:50.301
No. It sounds like
you're speaking English.

16:50.369 --> 16:52.971
I mean, it sounds
great. Like a relief.

16:53.038 --> 16:55.240
Frankly, it's been
almost two days,

16:55.307 --> 16:57.242
and my husband and
my daughters...

16:57.309 --> 16:59.978
they're having a hard time
with the whole thing.

17:00.045 --> 17:03.581
Well, then...

17:03.649 --> 17:07.050
I guess maybe it was meant to be
that we meet each other today.

17:08.721 --> 17:12.924
I'm only teaching
one class this semester.

17:12.992 --> 17:15.727
So if you need any help,
a translator or someone

17:15.794 --> 17:18.329
to speak to your
family on the phone...

17:18.396 --> 17:19.864
Oh no, I couldn't do that.

17:19.932 --> 17:22.000
Sure you could.

17:22.067 --> 17:24.469
And we are going
to work together.

17:24.537 --> 17:26.304
You are going to
get me involved.

17:26.372 --> 17:27.372
Right?

17:31.143 --> 17:33.444
I have devoted my adult life

17:33.512 --> 17:35.947
to studying this
beautiful language.

17:36.015 --> 17:39.284
and these beautiful
people; I want to help.

17:39.351 --> 17:40.285
Really, I do.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.353
Thanks.

18:14.617 --> 18:16.884
So. Have you
told her yet?

18:16.936 --> 18:19.187
Nope. Not yet.

18:19.255 --> 18:21.222
Told her what?

18:21.290 --> 18:23.891
None of your
beeswax, just eat.

18:23.943 --> 18:26.561
Your sister chose not to
go to gym all last week,

18:26.629 --> 18:30.765
so now she has to stay late
for detention all this week.

18:30.833 --> 18:33.567
Wow, you are bad.

18:33.619 --> 18:35.470
And Mom doesn't even know!

18:35.537 --> 18:37.872
How is she supposed to know?

18:37.923 --> 18:39.540
She can't understand
a word you tell her.

18:39.608 --> 18:41.575
It's like talking to a dog.

18:41.627 --> 18:44.245
Hey.
What?

18:51.604 --> 18:54.522
Hello?

18:54.590 --> 18:57.642
Yes, Mr. District Attorney,
she's here.

18:59.128 --> 19:02.563
H-Hold on one second.
Let me go into another room

19:02.615 --> 19:04.616
so I can write down
everything for her.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.468
How much will you give me?

19:07.536 --> 19:08.870
For what?

19:08.937 --> 19:12.123
You can't tell her anything.
She can't hear.

19:12.207 --> 19:13.741
I'll write her a note.

19:13.809 --> 19:15.810
Girls, what are you
talking about?

19:19.181 --> 19:23.785
Aw. I love you, too, babe.
I love both you girls.

19:23.852 --> 19:26.754
You go for the pencil,
I'll break your hand.

19:26.805 --> 19:28.289
Give me $5.00.

19:28.357 --> 19:30.358
Three.
Deal.

19:32.528 --> 19:33.678
Aw.

19:34.963 --> 19:37.899
Your boss needs you
to go to this address.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.867
Was that Devalos?

19:41.570 --> 19:44.572
Hey, Dad. You got
three singles?

19:47.602 --> 19:50.471
Uh, hello, whoever you
are, I can't talk now.

19:50.539 --> 19:52.540
Oh, yes you can,
you can talk to me.

19:52.607 --> 19:53.541
I speak your language.

19:53.608 --> 19:56.010
Jane! Dr. Livingston.

19:56.077 --> 19:57.344
What are you doing?

19:57.412 --> 19:59.346
Oh, I'm heading out
to a murder scene.

19:59.414 --> 20:02.016
Out in the desert, about
30 miles east of Kingman.

20:02.084 --> 20:04.018
That's just off the reservation.

20:04.086 --> 20:05.686
A lot of Navajo live out there.

20:05.754 --> 20:07.688
Was the person
who was murdered a Navajo?

20:07.756 --> 20:09.356
I don't know.

20:09.424 --> 20:10.891
You want company?

20:10.959 --> 20:14.361
You won't be able to understand
anyone if I'm not there, right?

20:14.429 --> 20:18.466
I'm at the university.
Come by and pick me up.

20:18.533 --> 20:21.368
It's weird. Guy was beat to
a pulp, then shot in the knee,

20:21.436 --> 20:26.040
the shoulder, the cheek,
and then got in the ankle.

20:26.108 --> 20:27.041
All at close range.

20:27.109 --> 20:30.711
Okay. Now what
does that tell us?

20:30.779 --> 20:32.746
Shooter couldn't
make up his mind?

20:34.166 --> 20:36.116
Whew. Hey, guys.

20:36.168 --> 20:39.086
This is Dr. Jane Livingston.
From Mesa University.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.955
She's a linguist, and
she knows an awful lot

20:41.022 --> 20:42.590
about the Navajos
that live in this area.

20:42.657 --> 20:46.126
Believe it or not, if there's
anything you want to say to me,

20:46.178 --> 20:48.846
she can translate it into a
language that I can understand.

20:48.930 --> 20:49.980
It's nice to meet you.

20:50.065 --> 20:52.399
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you both.

20:54.135 --> 20:55.202
Is that him?

20:56.037 --> 20:57.971
Yeah.

20:58.023 --> 21:02.576
If you'd like me to take a look,
I might be able to identify him.

21:04.162 --> 21:07.681
I spend a lot of time with
these people. I might know him.

21:07.749 --> 21:11.018
Well, we think we already
have a lead on who the guy is.

21:11.086 --> 21:13.587
But, uh, if you
really want to...

21:20.162 --> 21:22.096
Ugh. It's okay.
It's okay, come on.

21:22.163 --> 21:23.531
Let's get some
fresh air.

21:23.598 --> 21:27.568
On second thought, maybe
that wasn't such a good idea.

21:27.636 --> 21:28.903
No.

21:43.585 --> 21:46.187
The detective was saying
that they believe this man

21:46.254 --> 21:48.522
and the man who was burned
to death knew each other.

21:48.590 --> 21:51.859
Used to work on the same
construction crew.

21:51.927 --> 21:54.228
And they found this rifle

21:54.296 --> 21:56.997
hidden under the trailer.

21:57.065 --> 22:00.134
They're not sure if it's even
connected to the murder.

22:02.137 --> 22:03.704
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

22:03.755 --> 22:06.173
Come on!

22:06.241 --> 22:08.175
Come on! Come on! Come on!

22:33.835 --> 22:36.604
They robbed a bank.

22:36.671 --> 22:39.006
They worked together.
They were a team.

22:41.076 --> 22:45.045
They robbed
the Deming First National Bank.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.548
Did she do what I
think she just did?

22:47.616 --> 22:50.083
It's what she does.

22:51.386 --> 22:52.686
<i>You all right?</i>

22:52.754 --> 22:55.889
I don't know.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.808
I guess.

23:00.061 --> 23:02.947
I've never seen anyone
like that before.

23:03.031 --> 23:07.034
A bullet in the head.

23:07.101 --> 23:08.285
Dead.

23:08.370 --> 23:09.703
I tried to warn you.

23:09.771 --> 23:11.372
Oh, I know.

23:13.325 --> 23:16.493
I'm sure he lived
a violent life.

23:16.578 --> 23:19.747
It's just...

23:19.798 --> 23:23.500
Navaho's a dying language.

23:25.637 --> 23:29.056
Even the kids growing up
on the reservations,

23:29.140 --> 23:32.343
so few of them
speak it these days.

23:34.346 --> 23:38.399
And now two more men
who did are gone.

23:40.518 --> 23:43.270
That makes me sad.

23:45.273 --> 23:48.275
That's ridiculous, right?

23:48.326 --> 23:52.863
No. It's kind of tragic,
actually.

24:20.275 --> 24:22.676
Hello.

24:22.744 --> 24:25.679
Yes, she's here.

24:26.681 --> 24:28.899
It's for you.

24:30.285 --> 24:31.485
Hello.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.220
Am I taking you away
from something?

24:33.288 --> 24:35.889
Hi, Jane.

24:35.957 --> 24:38.425
I am calling in my new
and unofficial capacity

24:38.493 --> 24:40.594
as aide to Allison Dubois.

24:40.662 --> 24:42.162
The district attorney phoned me.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.865
Asked me if I could pass on
some new info to you.

24:44.933 --> 24:47.768
Said he would have e-mailed it,
but he wasn't near a computer.

24:47.836 --> 24:50.637
Well, cool. I have an aide.
I like that.

24:52.257 --> 24:55.242
That gun they found buried
beneath the trailer--

24:55.310 --> 24:57.578
turns out it was used
in the bank robbery

24:57.645 --> 25:00.180
in Deming, New Mexico,
last week.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.683
A masked man came in
with an assault rifle

25:02.751 --> 25:04.985
and fired a warning shot
into the ceiling.

25:05.053 --> 25:07.087
Walked away with a little over
a million dollars.

25:07.155 --> 25:09.156
Oh, wow.

25:09.224 --> 25:13.794
Also, and he said this would
probably only make sense to you:

25:13.862 --> 25:17.364
"Guess now we know what
the man in the fire suit

25:17.432 --> 25:19.032
was looking for in the trailer."

25:19.100 --> 25:21.135
Yeah, I guess we do.

25:21.202 --> 25:22.936
And that's all she wrote.

25:23.004 --> 25:25.506
So, listen...

25:29.794 --> 25:33.714
I know that this is
hard for you.

25:33.782 --> 25:38.552
Isolating and frustrating--
but for what it's worth,

25:38.620 --> 25:41.722
even with
all the blood and gore,

25:41.790 --> 25:44.324
this has been a kick.

25:44.392 --> 25:47.394
I never in a million years

25:47.462 --> 25:49.963
imagined I'd meet
someone like you.

25:50.031 --> 25:51.865
And never in a million years

25:51.933 --> 25:54.768
did I imagine I'd meet you
the way I did.

25:54.836 --> 25:58.172
So... thanks.

25:58.239 --> 26:00.207
You know, this isn't over.

26:00.275 --> 26:03.210
Oh, I don't know, I'm thinking
it's kind of close.

26:03.278 --> 26:05.846
I don't know why I'd say that.

26:05.914 --> 26:09.316
You're the psychic, not me.

26:09.384 --> 26:12.085
I guess it's a feeling I have.

26:12.153 --> 26:17.157
And I wanted to say that to you,
because I like you, Allison.

26:17.225 --> 26:19.760
Oh, I like you, too.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.362
All right, enough of that.

26:22.430 --> 26:24.465
You get back to your family.

26:24.532 --> 26:27.434
I'm getting back to my books.

26:27.502 --> 26:30.704
This is your aide signing off.

26:42.867 --> 26:44.718
Hi. This is Dr. Natalie Salem.

26:44.786 --> 26:46.453
If you're calling
with a medical emergency

26:46.521 --> 26:48.188
please hang up and dial 911.

26:48.256 --> 26:49.890
If you need to speak
with me personally,

26:49.958 --> 26:51.325
please leave
a detained message...

26:52.994 --> 26:54.428
You okay?

26:54.496 --> 26:56.630
Everybody's tucked in.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.532
Who was on the phone?

26:58.600 --> 27:01.768
I was just checking
my voice mail at work.

27:03.771 --> 27:06.139
Just a work call.

27:06.207 --> 27:09.877
It's... it's nothing.
It doesn't matter.

27:21.623 --> 27:24.858
Hey, don't say anything.

27:24.926 --> 27:28.795
I mean, you know,
I really wouldn't be able

27:28.863 --> 27:33.066
to understand what
you said if you did.

27:33.134 --> 27:37.971
So... just listen.

27:42.277 --> 27:45.646
I think all this
is almost over--

27:45.713 --> 27:48.115
I do.

27:48.182 --> 27:49.616
And Jane called earlier,

27:49.684 --> 27:52.252
and she thinks
it's almost over.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.254
Those two guys are dead.

27:54.322 --> 27:56.023
We know what happened.

27:56.090 --> 27:58.759
We know why.

27:58.826 --> 28:02.963
And that's why I think
it's almost over.

28:10.438 --> 28:12.606
So who knows, I could
wake up in the morning

28:12.674 --> 28:13.974
and suddenly understand

28:14.042 --> 28:16.677
everything everyone's
saying to me.

28:16.744 --> 28:21.081
I could wake up in the
morning and we could talk.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.656
'Cause I sense that we
really need to do that.

28:33.761 --> 28:37.564
♪ ♪

28:53.181 --> 28:54.448
Anyway, that's it.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.683
That's all I wanted to say.

29:32.213 --> 29:34.525
I've got a squad car
heading over to her home now.

29:35.256 --> 29:36.357
As soon as they make contact
with her,

29:36.437 --> 29:38.438
we can figure out
if we actually need to send

29:38.506 --> 29:40.073
a protective detail over there.

29:40.141 --> 29:42.041
Beyond that...

29:43.277 --> 29:45.845
I keep calling
and getting no answer.

29:45.913 --> 29:48.748
Allison, it's not even 7:00
in the morning.

29:48.816 --> 29:50.950
Maybe she's a sound sleeper.

29:51.018 --> 29:53.286
Maybe she's in the shower.

29:53.354 --> 29:57.190
This-- bludgeoning
by tiki totem--

29:57.258 --> 30:01.027
frankly there's something
off about the whole thing.

30:01.095 --> 30:03.730
It doesn't sound like something
that's happening here, now.

30:03.798 --> 30:05.165
She's a college professor.

30:05.232 --> 30:07.200
And she really has
nothing to do

30:07.268 --> 30:09.068
with any of the things
we're investigating,

30:09.136 --> 30:12.739
save for the fact
that she's a translator for you.

30:15.910 --> 30:18.111
I can't help but think

30:18.179 --> 30:20.747
that you're letting your
imagination get the best of you.

30:23.384 --> 30:27.620
In any event, once we've
made contact with her,

30:27.688 --> 30:29.355
I will contact you.

30:29.423 --> 30:30.990
Why don't you go home.

30:31.058 --> 30:32.625
Have breakfast with your family.

30:33.928 --> 30:36.196
You'll call me as soon
as you make contact?

30:36.263 --> 30:39.132
Yes, I will call you.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.302
Thank you.

30:45.172 --> 30:47.774
Okay, the two of you,
kiss your mother good-bye.

30:50.177 --> 30:51.110
Oh.

30:51.178 --> 30:52.812
See you after school, Mom.

30:55.849 --> 30:57.784
See you after school, Mom.

30:57.851 --> 30:59.702
Have a good day, Chicklets.

30:59.787 --> 31:01.905
Okay, see you after school, Mom.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

31:01.989 --> 31:03.656
Can you tell me
what she's saying?

31:07.795 --> 31:09.662
It's a recorded message.
It's a voice mail greeting.

31:09.730 --> 31:11.731
It's nothing.

31:11.799 --> 31:14.000
Is she saying something
about being sick

31:14.068 --> 31:15.735
or being out of town?

31:15.803 --> 31:18.504
No, just "Leave
your name and number."

31:20.140 --> 31:22.442
No.

31:24.078 --> 31:25.879
Got to get the girls to school.

31:25.946 --> 31:27.113
School-- I got it.

31:27.181 --> 31:30.216
See you later.
Love you, too.

31:32.219 --> 31:34.087
Hi, this is Jane.

31:34.154 --> 31:35.588
I'm not here right now,
so please

31:35.689 --> 31:37.557
leave a message and I'll
call you back.

31:37.625 --> 31:41.227
Hey, uh, Jane, hi.
This is Allison.

31:41.295 --> 31:43.763
Listen, I'm worried about you.

31:43.831 --> 31:45.765
I had an awful dream.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.400
This man that
I've never seen before,

31:47.468 --> 31:49.402
he was-- he was blond.

31:49.470 --> 31:51.104
You were getting out
of the shower.

31:51.171 --> 31:54.290
He-he-- I think he killed you.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.409
He hit you with this tiki thing.

31:56.477 --> 31:59.178
It was-- it was all
very Polynesian.

31:59.246 --> 32:02.515
I don't know-- I mean...

32:02.582 --> 32:04.150
It's so crazy.

32:04.218 --> 32:06.119
I don't know,
maybe I'm going crazy.

32:06.186 --> 32:08.154
Can you just call me, please?

32:24.972 --> 32:26.272
Hi. This is Jane.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.274
I'm not here right now
so please leave a message...

32:35.316 --> 32:36.649
Hi, this is Jane. I'm not...

32:53.867 --> 32:55.702
Welcome back.

32:55.769 --> 32:58.404
Everybody at the bar
says to say good night.

32:58.472 --> 33:01.708
Turns out, that threesome
you were so excited about

33:01.775 --> 33:03.276
isn't gonna work out.

33:05.579 --> 33:07.113
You drugged me.

33:07.181 --> 33:08.781
You put something
in my drink.

33:08.849 --> 33:11.084
I just sensed you weren't
gonna bring me back here

33:11.151 --> 33:14.287
and tell me what I needed
to know on your own.

33:14.355 --> 33:15.838
Was I off base?

33:17.841 --> 33:19.359
So...

33:22.396 --> 33:23.363
Where's the money?

33:23.430 --> 33:24.864
What money?

33:24.932 --> 33:28.101
The money you and your friend
were bragging about

33:28.168 --> 33:30.103
grabbing from that bank
the other night.

33:30.170 --> 33:33.573
When you two were getting
trashed at Colby's bar.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.709
You know, you really
ought to watch what you say,

33:36.777 --> 33:38.711
'cause you never know
who might be listening.

33:38.779 --> 33:40.313
Wait a second.

33:40.381 --> 33:41.614
You speak Navajo?

33:41.682 --> 33:45.051
And five other
fairly useless languages.

33:45.119 --> 33:47.236
So I'm never gonna make
a million dollars,

33:47.321 --> 33:48.654
unless I take it from you.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.123
So tell me where it is.

33:51.825 --> 33:53.793
And you don't even
have to do it in English.

33:53.861 --> 33:55.261
I'm willing to work
for my money.

33:56.363 --> 33:58.231
You think I'm kidding?

33:58.298 --> 34:00.299
How about I shoot you
in the ankle?

34:00.367 --> 34:01.801
How'd that be
for a conversation starter?

34:04.938 --> 34:06.806
Yeah, you were
laughing your pants off

34:06.874 --> 34:08.708
about your little bank robbery
the other night,

34:08.775 --> 34:10.393
but you're not laughing now,
are you?

34:11.445 --> 34:12.911
What?

34:12.980 --> 34:15.081
You figured you were
in some college bar

34:15.149 --> 34:17.483
with a bunch of palefaces
who wouldn't understand

34:17.551 --> 34:19.717
a word you were saying?

34:19.770 --> 34:22.255
That was a big mistake, Tonto.

34:22.322 --> 34:25.291
Because my friend and I
were sitting right there,

34:25.359 --> 34:27.393
and we understood
just about everything.

34:27.460 --> 34:31.898
So what do you say
we stop making mistakes?

34:31.965 --> 34:35.368
Tell me where the money is
and maybe I won't kill you.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.603
Okay.

34:38.672 --> 34:39.772
You got nothing to say?

34:41.408 --> 34:42.809
How about we up the ante?

34:42.876 --> 34:44.643
How about I shoot you
in your knee?

34:46.513 --> 34:47.914
I'm gonna count to three.

34:47.981 --> 34:48.981
One...

34:50.250 --> 34:51.951
two... three.

34:55.922 --> 34:57.423
Hello.

34:59.426 --> 35:00.993
Lee?

35:01.061 --> 35:04.230
I-I can't understand you,
but I can recognize your voice.

35:04.298 --> 35:06.265
Lee, I can't understand you.

35:06.366 --> 35:09.435
Listen, you know that man
that I saw murder Jane,

35:09.503 --> 35:11.204
the blond man?

35:11.271 --> 35:13.940
He killed both
those Navajo bank robbers.

35:16.543 --> 35:18.127
Lee, what are you saying?

35:18.212 --> 35:19.745
Is this about Jane?

35:19.813 --> 35:22.048
Is-is this about Jane?

35:22.116 --> 35:23.950
Just text me.

35:24.017 --> 35:25.585
Text me.

35:42.064 --> 35:45.199
Are you coming to bed?

35:49.371 --> 35:51.372
Are you coming to bed?

35:54.877 --> 35:57.044
I'm going to bed.

35:59.081 --> 36:01.182
This is a real bonanza for you,
isn't it?

36:03.051 --> 36:05.720
This is just a great cover.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.789
And then you could totally
opt out of everything

36:07.856 --> 36:10.792
and, "hell, the little woman
wouldn't understand

36:10.859 --> 36:12.460
a word I was saying anyway."

36:12.528 --> 36:14.629
What do you want from me?

36:14.696 --> 36:18.099
Sorry, <i>no comprende.</i>

36:18.167 --> 36:21.268
You do understand
that I'm worried sick

36:21.320 --> 36:23.171
about my friend, right?

36:23.238 --> 36:24.806
She's just gone.

36:24.873 --> 36:27.875
She's apparently the victim
of some kind of foul play.

36:30.579 --> 36:33.748
Do you even care that I'm upset?

36:33.799 --> 36:36.050
That I'm worried?

36:36.117 --> 36:38.386
Because you're making
absolutely no effort

36:38.454 --> 36:39.987
to even try to communicate.

36:42.858 --> 36:44.859
And it's just killing me.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.922
I know.

37:34.810 --> 37:36.978
It's okay.

37:40.449 --> 37:42.083
You'd better.

No.

Hey, you can't
get in here.

37:52.628 --> 37:54.629
Nobody invited you in.

37:56.932 --> 37:59.867
I'm not impressed.

37:59.935 --> 38:02.870
Well, okay, maybe
I'm a little impressed.

I know that you and the man
who murdered those bank robbers

40:11.833 --> 40:13.701
were in it together,
and I told the authorities

40:13.769 --> 40:14.935
everything I know.

40:15.003 --> 40:18.139
I wouldn't have
expected you to do otherwise.

40:18.190 --> 40:20.841
By the way,
I checked my messages.

40:20.892 --> 40:23.343
Your calls meant a lot to me.

40:23.395 --> 40:26.380
Especially your premonition
about my untimely passing.

40:26.448 --> 40:28.983
Soon as I checked
into the house I rented,

40:29.051 --> 40:32.903
I saw the Polynesian decor
and the tiki on the dresser,

40:32.988 --> 40:36.523
and I knew exactly
what was going to happen.

40:36.575 --> 40:40.027
My greedy boyfriend wanted
all the money to himself.

he's out of the picture now.

40:47.035 --> 40:49.103
You murdered him?

40:49.171 --> 40:50.671
I defended myself.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.590
You helped me defend myself.

40:52.674 --> 40:55.893
Actually, I'll miss him.

40:55.977 --> 40:57.228
But at least I'll have

40:57.312 --> 40:59.880
over a million dollars
to keep me company.

Oh, Allison, don't be that way.

41:17.065 --> 41:18.332
Times are tough,

41:18.400 --> 41:19.566

aren't enough

41:19.618 --> 41:21.368
lucrative opportunities
for anthrolinguists

41:21.420 --> 41:22.670
these days.

41:22.737 --> 41:25.372
And teaching just doesn't
pay what it should.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.210
On the other hand,
crime totally pays.

41:29.277 --> 41:31.045
You can't run forever.

41:31.113 --> 41:32.963
Actually, I can.

41:38.620 --> 41:40.271
I trusted her and she used me.

41:40.355 --> 41:42.523

an all-access pass

41:42.590 --> 41:44.291
to our investigation.

41:44.359 --> 41:45.526
Some psychic.

41:45.594 --> 41:49.230
She fooled us all, Allison.

41:49.297 --> 41:50.765
Just a fact of life.

41:54.119 --> 41:56.570
At least not right away.

41:56.621 --> 41:58.272

they always do--

41:58.340 --> 42:00.741

we'll get her.

42:10.168 --> 42:12.486
