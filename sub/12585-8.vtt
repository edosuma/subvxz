00:34.200 --> 00:35.994
I thought of a new game this morning.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.454
A pancake fell on the floor,

00:37.537 --> 00:41.041
so I closed my eyes and put it
back on one of our plates.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.584
Now, I don't know whose plate.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.086
I call it Pancake Roulette.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.006
Mm.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.055
I'm gonna triple-jump this monkey.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.432
Could someone put pancake in my mouth?

00:57.515 --> 01:00.935
Bobby, I told you,
no video games at the table.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.687
-
I know, but this is homework.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.148
It's my assignment for PE class.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.859
I know I should have done it last night,

01:07.942 --> 01:09.819
but I was watching TV and...

01:09.903 --> 01:12.614
Wait, they're letting you
play video games in PE?

01:12.697 --> 01:15.700
Yeah! It's for people
who don't want to exercise.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.828
It's the Active Electronic
Lifestyle option.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.330
Well, that's asinine.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.874
PE is supposed to be about sports.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.376
They make video games for lots of sports:

01:25.460 --> 01:27.420
football, baseball, golf.

01:27.504 --> 01:31.549
My thumbs are gonna be huge.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.136
Get in the truck.

01:36.554 --> 01:40.100
This really isn't a good time
to put me back in PE.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.812
They're making everybody take
the Presidential Fitness Test.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.773
Bobby, when the President
asks you to take a test,

01:46.856 --> 01:48.149
you take the test.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.111
But they make you take it
in front of everybody.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.405
And they measure
your body fat with calipers.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.740
Calipers!

01:55.824 --> 01:57.867
Don't worry, Bobby. I'll help you train.

01:58.409 --> 02:02.622
It'll be great.
We'll set goals, design a program

02:02.705 --> 02:04.833
and chart your progress.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.298
Hill?

02:12.382 --> 02:13.633
What are you doing here?

02:13.716 --> 02:16.553
I thought all the doughy kids
were gonna take the easy way out.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.595
No offense, Hank.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.848
Well, you call 'em
like you see 'em, Coach.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.558
But that's why Bobby is here.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.435
He's taking the Presidential Fitness Test.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.604
Son, take your place in line.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.732
And do whatever Coach Kleehammer screams.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.001
What the heck is going on, Carl?

02:48.084 --> 02:50.170
I know the divorce hasn't been easy,

02:50.253 --> 02:52.797
but that's no reason to take it out on PE.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.216
School board wants more
computers in the classroom,

02:55.300 --> 02:56.718
and they said this counts.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.803
You got to understand my position, Hank.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.515
I can't believe you are spending
our tax dollars on...

03:03.308 --> 03:05.476
Lowrider Rampage.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.686
We're not spending a penny.

03:06.769 --> 03:07.770
It's a new program

03:07.854 --> 03:09.522
in conjunction with the community college.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.609
Their kids design the games
and our kids test them.

03:13.484 --> 03:14.360
Could be worse.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.154
There's a school in Houston
that sits around

03:16.237 --> 03:17.780
watching Kung Fu movies all day.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.409
But playing video games isn't
the same as doing a pull-up.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.453
These kids should be outside.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.705
Especially that one.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.624
He ain't a student, Hank.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.167
That's one of our student teachers.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.627
'Bout time you got here.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.962
Boys' bathroom stinks, dude.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.756
What? I'm not the janitor.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.716
And you need to show some respect.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.176
Hey, that's a sweet hat.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.969
Where'd you get it, Urban Outfitters?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.387
I got it at work.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.305
Oh.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.349
Do you work at Urban Outfitters?

03:44.432 --> 03:47.477
No. I work at Strickland Propane.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.937
It's not ironic?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.688
You're got-dang right it's not.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.441
How in the hell can a hat be ironic?

03:53.524 --> 03:55.526
Check out how aggro this guy is.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.238
Dang, I just got shot in the face!

03:59.280 --> 04:01.616
Come on.

04:06.996 --> 04:10.083
The President's Fitness Test
demands total focus.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.085
Those that pass will get a certificate,

04:12.168 --> 04:14.837
printed with a version
of the president's signature.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.799
Those who do not pass will get a magnet.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.717
A blank magnet!

04:29.310 --> 04:31.020
Strickland Propane.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.480
Taste the meat, not the heat.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.317
Uh, well, most people
put ketchup or mustard on it.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.028
No, I wouldn't recommend both.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.201
Ah, don't touch that!

04:45.285 --> 04:47.578
What are you people doing here anyway?

04:47.662 --> 04:49.747
I don't know. You got us curious
about propane.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.251
Check it out. Propane's a liquid
and a gas.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.335
I know that.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.463
I've been stocking that pamphlet
since before you were born.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.590
Hey, dude, how do we get
one of those hats?

04:59.674 --> 05:02.135
By dedicating your life to propane.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.595
You're not qualified to wear one of these.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.807
What if someone came up to you
with a leaky propane tank

05:07.890 --> 05:09.851
and all you could do
is stand there and say,

05:09.934 --> 05:12.270
"Duh, I don't know.
I'm just wearing the hat"?

05:12.353 --> 05:13.730
"Leaky propane tank."

05:16.232 --> 05:17.817
I think he's about to take a swing at us.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.901
Awesome.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.361
Leave.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.702
Boy, I'm glad I got you
out of that video game class, Bobby.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.997
Those teachers are
a couple of giblet-heads.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.332
Isn't this better?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.083
Pain leading to gain.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.378
Yeah, this is just great.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.505
What the heck is Hank Hill making?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.090
Maybe he going to hang up Gribble

05:41.174 --> 05:42.967
and beat him until candy comes out.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.303
No. If Gribble had candy inside him,

05:45.386 --> 05:46.971
Bobby Hill would've found it already.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.059
Standing long jump.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.479
Now, when I say "go,"
jump as far as you can.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.855
Swing your arms.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.148
And... go!

05:59.317 --> 06:00.276
Really?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.528
Uh, well...

06:02.612 --> 06:04.781
okay, son, uh, good effort,

06:04.864 --> 06:05.865
good effort.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.743
Hey, dudes, video game PE
is harder than I thought.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.953
Do you think you could
help me with my homework?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.538
Sorry, Joseph.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.998
I got to jump.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.959
The new game my teacher made
is about propane.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.713
Well, that figures.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.132
Those two idiots spelled it wrong.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.258
Hey, wait a second.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.844
This looks like Strickland Propane.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.846
See, I can't move my bobtail.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.431
Try pressing the red button.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.518
Oh, my God!

06:33.601 --> 06:35.978
Dad, it's you!

06:36.062 --> 06:37.814
-Cool!
-Cool!

06:37.897 --> 06:39.607
I tell you what.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.410
So, wait, when you play
this game, you get to be Hank?

06:51.285 --> 06:52.745
That sounds interesting.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.206
It's not interesting. It's thievery.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.292
You can't just take
someone's face without asking.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.502
Thank you!

07:01.754 --> 07:03.089
This is crazy.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.383
Those idiot gamers have put features

07:05.466 --> 07:08.261
of the Char King onto the Flamemaster.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.762
This won't stand.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.013
We have to do something.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.267
They're exploiting my business
for financial gain!

07:14.350 --> 07:17.353
Potentially huge,
incredible financial gain!

07:17.437 --> 07:20.106
Catalog every mention
of Strickland Propane

07:20.189 --> 07:23.484
and other verbiage for which I own
or intend to own a copyright.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.402
Yes, sir.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.363
Roger's already getting me
familiar with the game.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.323
I think I got all
the points I can in here.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.491
Let's go outside.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.535
Oh, my god.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.829
You just punched that motorist!

07:34.912 --> 07:36.247
I needed a vehicle.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.334
This is horrible!

07:42.086 --> 07:43.337
Hold on a second.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.173
I'm gonna engage these guys.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.424
Engage?

07:50.511 --> 07:52.180
Well, that's the basics.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.431
I got a delivery to make.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.350
Remember, cops are bad.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.359
Taste the meat and the heat.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.030
Oh, god, I just stabbed
a parking attendant.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.949
Where's the button to turn myself in?

08:16.370 --> 08:17.872
Well, Hank, as you can see,

08:17.955 --> 08:20.208
pretty much nothing happens
when you're not here.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.710
Sorry, Bobby, I can't train you right now.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.213
I've got some work to do
for Mr. Strickland.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.048
I'll help you, Bobby.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.674
All right, let's see what you got.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.468
Jump over the bar!

08:30.551 --> 08:34.388
Uh, actually, Dale,
I need your help with the video game.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.182
Bobby, I'll be right back.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.850
Go ahead and get started.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.479
I thought my dad knew me better.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.898
I am not a self-motivator.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.900
I'm not doing anything.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.944
I could help you
until your dad comes back.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.787
Try kicking your legs.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.002
Watch and learn.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.673
I'm going to teach you
a technique I call brain hand.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.967
It involves me mentally
shutting off my brain,

09:11.050 --> 09:13.261
and then moving it into my hands.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.017
Aw, come on!
If you threw a propane tank at a car,

09:20.101 --> 09:21.769
neither one of them would explode.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.063
Dale, make Hank wave back at me.

09:26.607 --> 09:27.608
My turn! I'm next!

09:28.317 --> 09:29.694
Where do I find Peggy?

09:32.154 --> 09:34.782
But I barely got to be Hank at all.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.784
Okay, that's enough messing around.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.161
I'm on official Strickland business.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.582
A Manager mode, huh?

09:43.332 --> 09:45.001
I didn't notice that before.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.836
That's kind of interesting.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.548
Wow, North Arlen's changed.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.926
There sure are a lot of
check cashing places.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.428
Oh, look at that pretty lady

09:55.511 --> 09:57.888
taking her little baby for a walk.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.223
Oh, no! Get him, Hank!

09:59.307 --> 10:00.516
Before he gets away!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.393
Huh? Well, okay.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.480
Well, this bobtail handles nicely.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.732
Hurry, Hank! Hurry!

10:10.484 --> 10:11.569
Don't chase him!

10:11.652 --> 10:13.237
Shoot him in the back!

10:13.321 --> 10:14.905
That's not how I do things.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.577
You did it!

10:20.161 --> 10:22.538
Hey, maybe this game doesn't
have to be about the mayhem.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.835
You'll never rob
a mini-mart again, buster.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.217
-<i>You've been promoted
to Senior Manager.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:37.094
Oh, my god, what's next?

10:37.178 --> 10:39.180
Regional Manager?

10:47.104 --> 10:48.397
Got-dang pimp.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.042
Excuse me.
I'm looking to upgrade my grill.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.921
Well, propane is ideal
for both home and business.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.006
Uh, okay...

11:16.759 --> 11:17.843
Well, bad news,

11:17.927 --> 11:18.928
Ol' Top.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.304
No need for us to fool around

11:20.388 --> 11:21.681
with this game anymore.

11:21.764 --> 11:22.848
What? Why?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.684
Well, there's no money in it.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.019
Lawyer says it's in the public domain.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.690
But there... there are three more levels
I haven't even seen yet.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.359
Yeah, well,
I ain't gonna make any money off it,

11:33.442 --> 11:35.152
so quit playing and get back to work.

11:42.451 --> 11:43.452
Okay.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.414
Grab the bar, you sissified
piece of lady snot!

11:47.748 --> 11:49.583
That's what my coach always says.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.174
Go! Go! Go!

11:57.258 --> 11:58.384
Almost there.

12:01.887 --> 12:05.224
Bobby, you got off the ground.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.809
What was it?

12:06.892 --> 12:07.977
Printer paper?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.186
No.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.438
Construction.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.733
This is why my dad hasn't been around.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.818
He wanted me to gut it out.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.194
And I did!

12:28.456 --> 12:29.331
All right!

12:29.415 --> 12:31.584
Drop and give me one!

12:31.667 --> 12:33.836
You pathetic little cockroach!

12:33.919 --> 12:35.004
Give me a push-up.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.589
Now! Now! Now!

12:45.598 --> 12:47.266
Cockroach did a push-up.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.393
Cockroach did a push-up!

12:49.477 --> 12:51.228
I gotta go tell my dad!

12:54.315 --> 12:55.733
Mom, I did a push-up

12:55.858 --> 12:58.068
a real live push-up,
not a lady one either.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.737
I gave a hundred and ten percent

12:59.820 --> 13:01.113
and I gotta go tell Dad!

13:03.199 --> 13:04.784
My face was on the ground,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.452
and then I started pushing,

13:06.535 --> 13:08.788
and then when I opened my eyes,

13:08.871 --> 13:10.998
the ground was moving away from my face!

13:11.081 --> 13:12.208
Uh-huh.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.002
Wanna see me do a push-up
without bending my knees?

13:15.085 --> 13:17.838
One more punk and I am Regional Manager.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.051
I think your father would love
to see you do a push-up.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.302
Right, Hank?

13:23.385 --> 13:24.428
Hmm.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.643
Well, that's a thinker.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.311
It sure is!

13:32.394 --> 13:34.605
I'm gonna go hit the showers.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.151
Well, that's the way you manage a region.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.123
Why'd you do that?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.416
To be dramatic.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.503
Well, quick! If you plug it back in,
it might start where I left off.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.546
A woman knows

13:58.629 --> 14:00.714
when her husband has an addiction, Hank.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.425
A woman who reads Parade Magazine knows.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.136
What? No! You're overreacting!

14:06.220 --> 14:07.054
Am I?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.223
Do you have any idea how your son's doing?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.474
Or the lawn?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.601
Nothing's wrong with the lawn.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.062
Hank, there's a brown spot.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.440
And there's also a brown spot on your son.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.358
What?

14:19.441 --> 14:20.776
What are you talking about?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.152
I'm lunging!

14:22.236 --> 14:23.696
I'm feelin' the burn!

14:25.406 --> 14:27.658
Was Bobby just doing lunges?

14:30.995 --> 14:32.413
Oh, my god, you're right.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.164
I didn't realize killing a man

14:34.248 --> 14:36.750
with my bare thumbs
would change me so much.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.920
I'll quit.

14:40.004 --> 14:40.838
Prove it.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.006
Trash that controller.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.054
"Ask Marilyn" says that people

14:49.138 --> 14:52.433
who own fancy electronics
are called' "technosexuals."

14:52.516 --> 14:53.559
Take it.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.104
Okay, let's go. Grab your feet.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.397
Come on. Grab 'em.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.359
Good try. "A" for effort.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.695
Nice work. All right, break time.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.281
Bobby, go get your Game Boy.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.282
What?

15:08.365 --> 15:09.658
Your Game Boy. Go get it.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.201
Is this a trick?

15:13.329 --> 15:14.204
Yes, it was.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.748
And, uh, and you passed.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.374
And for your reward...

15:17.458 --> 15:19.001
go get your Game Boy.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.836
Dad!

15:20.920 --> 15:22.212
Nice try!

15:42.650 --> 15:45.027
It's good to have you back, Hank.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.780
I figured out how to drink
my beer through osmosis.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.865
Yeah.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.368
Well, the game was way too easy anyway.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.328
The designers could've
bumped it up a notch.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.663
I still enjoy it.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.208
I found some folks on the Internet
who play against each other online.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.334
You can do that?

16:00.417 --> 16:02.670
Yeah, I'm not very good.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.672
There are too many Hanks on the screen.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.423
I never know which one to listen to.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.301
I didn't know playing online
was even an option.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.555
Uh, there's a smudge on my glasses.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.556
Excuse me.

16:15.599 --> 16:16.976
Mm-hmm.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.435
I'm so buzzed.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.361
Don't judge me, Lady Bird.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.912
No, no, not my pimp cup.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.541
How could you, Hank?

16:40.624 --> 16:42.710
All right, how about this?

16:42.793 --> 16:44.753
I'll only play one night
a week, after work.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.422
I won't even watch TV.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.425
-No.
-Well, what about you? You have hobbies!

16:49.508 --> 16:51.593
You play Boggle. Let's talk about that.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.054
Hmm-mm, you will not turn this
around on me.

16:54.138 --> 16:58.308
I married a man, Hank, not a... gamer.

17:05.149 --> 17:08.819
Carl, I need to find
those game quote-unquote teachers.

17:08.902 --> 17:09.737
Sorry, Peggy.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.613
Video game program's been cancelled.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.491
Bunch of parents found out their kids
were playing video games,

17:14.575 --> 17:16.452
started something called
an "action group."

17:16.535 --> 17:18.037
Scared the hell out of the district.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.788
I need to find them, Carl.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.498
I have a question about their game.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.877
Well, you can probably rule out
any place with girls.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.045
Go on, get.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.171
Get on back to PE.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.635
Body horror makes classic horror
look like Euro horror.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.637
Wait, what's body horror?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.264
Why are we even friends?

17:37.347 --> 17:39.058
Oh, thank God I found you.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.603
My husband Hank is addicted
to your Pro-Pain game.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.605
I need your help to get him to stop.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.066
Well, don't worry.
It'll fall out of style.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.859
Only like six people still play it.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.445
Yeah, things don't fall out
of style for Hank.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.696
There's only two things

17:52.780 --> 17:54.323
that will stop a gamer from gaming:

17:54.406 --> 17:56.283
boredom or humiliation.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.160
Though two percent stop
because of seizures.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.455
Hank is incapable of boredom or seizures.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.916
But humiliation...

18:08.670 --> 18:11.423
Taste the meat and the heat.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.093
My Hank died.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.553
Dude.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.097
I got pro-pained!

18:18.180 --> 18:19.389
Hey, everybody!

18:19.473 --> 18:20.974
I'm Hank Hill!

18:21.058 --> 18:22.976
I'm driving home to have a hot meal

18:23.060 --> 18:27.231
with my wife and my son,
whom I love so much!

18:28.982 --> 18:30.275
Yes!

18:30.776 --> 18:31.735
What?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.237
But I killed everyone.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.697
Escucha me.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.271
You?

19:07.354 --> 19:09.064
Well, that's first timer's luck.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.274
You won't get me again.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.367
Why won't you die?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.703
I am invincible.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.079
That's cheating.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.289
Tell me how.

19:25.372 --> 19:28.959
The programmers who made the game put me
in "Commissioner Mode."

19:29.042 --> 19:31.295
-What?
-There is no one above me,

19:31.378 --> 19:32.921
and I cannot be killed.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.424
And once this Commissioner
explodes itself,

19:35.507 --> 19:38.051
that is the end of the game.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.511
Forever.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.013
No, no, no.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.931
Can, can I try Commissioner Mode?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.766
Please, just 15 minutes.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.436
Don't do it. Don't do it.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.408
Well, thank you, Peggy.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.162
It feels good to blink.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.389
Way to go.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.849
-Bobby!
-Woo-hoo!

20:25.933 --> 20:27.559
Good job, Hill.

20:27.643 --> 20:28.894
You need two more to pass.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.778
Sorry, Coach, that's all I got.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.738
Take your magnet.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.698
Okay, next up!

20:48.413 --> 20:49.873
Tell me when to squeeze.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.583
I don't deserve it.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.502
What are you talking about? You did great.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.420
Why? I failed.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.340
I'm not getting
the President's Fitness Award.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.675
Bobby, turn around.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.596
You did one more pull-up

21:04.680 --> 21:06.181
than all these other kids.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.350
Yeah, you're right!

21:08.433 --> 21:10.852
And we'll start training
for next year right now.

21:10.936 --> 21:11.895
Great!

21:11.979 --> 21:15.148
Dad, do you think
I should shave off my body hair

21:15.232 --> 21:17.734
to be more aerodynamic next time?

21:17.818 --> 21:20.362
No, Bobby, I don't.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.191
-<i>Taste the meat and the heat.</i>
