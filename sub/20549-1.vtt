00:43.753 --> 00:45.744
Mother!

00:48.174 --> 00:50.165
Mother!

00:54.639 --> 00:57.973
Your mother can't be
with you anymore.

00:59.018 --> 01:01.009
Come.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.093
- Friend Owl.
- Excuse me, sir.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.641
I hope I'm not intruding, but...

01:41.727 --> 01:44.685
Well, I just had to come.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.852
Poor little fellow.

01:48.985 --> 01:51.977
So young to be without his mother.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.360
Well, if I can be of any help...

01:58.494 --> 02:00.451
Wait.

02:00.538 --> 02:03.246
I could use your help.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.617
Find me a suitable doe to raise Bambi.

02:06.711 --> 02:10.750
Oh, yes. Of course, yes.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.293
Food's so scarce.

02:13.384 --> 02:16.843
Does can barely feed themselves.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.300
Perhaps you could...

02:20.391 --> 02:25.056
Me? You know as well as I do,
a prince looks after the herd.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.928
Does care for the young.

02:27.064 --> 02:32.559
But you are his father, and
circumstances being what they are...

02:38.868 --> 02:41.576
- Until spring.
- Oh, excellent.

02:41.704 --> 02:45.368
After all, who better
to raise the young prince

02:45.458 --> 02:48.291
than the Great Prince himself?

03:26.999 --> 03:31.243
<i>Under the snow,
beneath the frozen streams</i>

03:31.337 --> 03:36.503
<i>There is life</i>

03:36.634 --> 03:38.625
<i>You have to know</i>

03:38.761 --> 03:41.002
<i>When nature sleeps, she dreams</i>

03:41.138 --> 03:45.553
<i>There is life</i>

03:45.643 --> 03:50.729
<i>And the colder the winter,
the warmer the spring</i>

03:50.815 --> 03:55.560
<i>The deeper the sorrow,
the more our hearts sing</i>

03:55.653 --> 03:58.065
<i>Even when you can't see it</i>

03:58.155 --> 04:03.446
<i>Inside everything</i>

04:03.536 --> 04:09.373
<i>There is life</i>

04:23.389 --> 04:27.348
<i>After the rain, the sun will reappear</i>

04:27.435 --> 04:31.770
<i>There is life</i>

04:32.857 --> 04:36.566
<i>After the pain, the joy will still be here</i>

04:36.694 --> 04:41.234
<i>There is life</i>

04:41.365 --> 04:46.576
<i>For it's out of the darkness
that we learn to see</i>

04:46.704 --> 04:51.198
<i>And out of the silence
that songs come to be</i>

04:51.292 --> 04:58.164
<i>And all that we dream of
awaits patiently</i>

04:58.257 --> 05:04.219
<i>There is life</i>

05:06.223 --> 05:13.186
<i>There is life</i>

05:49.934 --> 05:51.550
Good morning.

05:51.644 --> 05:55.558
Bambi, a prince awakens
before the forest does.

05:55.648 --> 05:58.686
If you're late again,
I'll have no choice but to...

06:00.110 --> 06:02.363
What was that?

06:02.446 --> 06:04.437
What was what?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.775
I guess it was my stomach.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.201
Then you should eat.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.740
Oh, well...

06:15.834 --> 06:20.123
I suppose I should
find you something to eat.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.967
Here.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.173
No, thank you.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.472
- Have you ever tried it?
- Well, no.

06:35.563 --> 06:41.479
Then how do you know
you don't like it if you've never tried it?

06:50.077 --> 06:54.162
Come along. We have to check
on the other deer in the South Wood.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.870
Bambi!

06:59.003 --> 07:02.962
A prince does not whoo-hoo.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.961
- He doesn't?
- He certainly does not.

07:06.051 --> 07:09.214
A prince maintains control at all times.

07:09.346 --> 07:13.010
Display dignity. Walk with pride.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.184
I'm okay!

07:37.916 --> 07:39.907
Cold! Cold!

07:50.054 --> 07:53.342
One, two...

07:53.432 --> 07:55.048
Two...

07:55.309 --> 07:56.424
Two...

08:29.343 --> 08:32.927
Don't you think it'd be better
if we got a little closer?

08:33.013 --> 08:36.096
The distance makes it easier
to spot danger.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.936
But it sure makes it
harder to play with them.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.273
Play is a healthy part
of a young deer's development.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.603
- Is that so?
- Mother says so.

08:49.697 --> 08:53.281
- One time, Mother and I were out...
- Bambi.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.108
A fawn came over and wanted to play...

08:55.202 --> 08:56.863
Bambi.

08:58.956 --> 09:03.541
I think it's best to
leave the past in the past.

09:03.627 --> 09:07.291
A prince does not look back,
only ahead.

09:08.507 --> 09:09.542
Yes, sir.

09:09.633 --> 09:13.376
Now, come. We still have
a lot of ground to cover today.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.336
Don't fall behind.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.005
Thumper!

09:53.343 --> 09:56.506
Bambi! Boy, am I glad to see you.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.216
What's wrong?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.840
They've been after me all morning.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.017
- Who has?
- Oh, big brother!

10:04.104 --> 10:06.015
It's them!

10:12.070 --> 10:15.199
- Hello, young prince.
- Hello, young prince.

10:15.282 --> 10:19.196
- Oh. Hello.
- Have you seen Thumper around?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.869
I think he's over there. Look, look.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.578
Oh, okay.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.251
I guess we will be leaving, then.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.262
Gotcha!

10:41.725 --> 10:44.843
Mama says you're gonna
take us to see the groundhog.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.723
What she says goes.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.055
Well, she's not the boss of me.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.733
If I don't want to, Mama can't make me.

11:00.911 --> 11:05.280
- Hi, Mama.
- What did your father tell you?

11:05.415 --> 11:09.625
- About what?
- About playing with your sisters.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.586
Oh, that one.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.587
A family that plays together

11:18.595 --> 11:21.178
stays together,

11:22.432 --> 11:27.177
even if it means
taking your dumb sisters.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.511
Bambi!

11:30.858 --> 11:33.441
Coming! I gotta go.

11:33.527 --> 11:37.771
But you can't go.
You can't leave me with the girls.

11:37.865 --> 11:41.950
Come on, Thumper. You gotta
take us to see the groundhog.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.647
Why don't you go with your friends
to see the groundhog?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.644
But I want to stay with you.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.897
Yes, well...

12:17.821 --> 12:21.189
I have to check on the South Meadow,
and it's very far.

12:21.283 --> 12:25.743
You go see the groundhog.
I'll meet you there later.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.445
Okay.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.574
I'll meet you.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.243
Hey, Thumper, wait for me!

12:40.844 --> 12:42.676
- You sit by me!
- No,no!

12:42.763 --> 12:44.754
Quiet!

12:45.807 --> 12:47.593
First one there's who I sit by.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.052
- Hooray! It's gonna be me!
- It's gonna be me!

12:51.146 --> 12:55.140
I'm sure glad your father let you come.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.945
He understands.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.360
He and I are best pals.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.750
Wake up, Flower. Wake up.

13:23.929 --> 13:27.217
Come on, Flower.
You're gonna miss the groundhog.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.680
Gosh, I hope
the groundhog sees his shadow,

13:33.063 --> 13:37.227
so I can get back to hibernating.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.729
Attention, everyone. Attention.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.029
Everybody, gather round.

13:43.115 --> 13:46.107
We'll be starting
in just a few moments, yes.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.283
Now, there's plenty of room.

13:48.370 --> 13:52.659
Ma'am, could you just scoot over one?

13:52.749 --> 13:54.911
Very nice.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.839
The young prince.
This is a special occasion.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.587
We decided we'll all sit by you.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.296
Greetings, greetings.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.301
Each year we gather round

14:10.392 --> 14:15.387
to watch the groundhog
emerge from his winter slumber,

14:15.480 --> 14:17.938
for if he sees his shadow...

14:18.025 --> 14:20.517
It means more winter!

14:20.610 --> 14:23.648
Yes. But if he doesn't...

14:23.739 --> 14:26.026
Spring is on its way!

14:27.159 --> 14:28.365
Yes.

14:28.452 --> 14:33.071
Now, without any further interruptions,

14:33.915 --> 14:36.043
the groundhog!

14:38.712 --> 14:40.749
The groundhog!

14:49.014 --> 14:51.005
Where's the groundhog?

14:51.099 --> 14:53.340
- Groundhog! Groundhog!
- Groundhog! Groundhog!

14:55.312 --> 14:57.679
Now, what seems to be the problem?

14:57.773 --> 15:01.391
I'm afraid to go out there.
I'll see my shadow.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.852
Well, that's entirely the point, isn't it?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.982
I don't care.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.156
Must we go through this every year?

15:18.502 --> 15:21.119
Hello, Bambi.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.585
Hi, Faline.

15:26.802 --> 15:30.170
- I almost didn't recognize you.
- Really?

15:30.263 --> 15:33.597
I guess it's 'cause
my spots are almost gone.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.892
And my antlers are coming in, too.
Can you see them?

15:36.978 --> 15:38.810
Well...

15:38.897 --> 15:41.514
I don't see anything.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.945
Well, I don't.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.986
Oh, well, yes.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.694
The groundhog!

15:54.788 --> 15:58.122
Why me? This is the last year.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.041
My nerves just can't take it anymore.

16:01.545 --> 16:05.755
- I see his shadow.
- More winter.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.924
More hibernating.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.469
No shadow, no shadow.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.258
Please, no shadow.
Please don't let there be a shadow.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.059
Please don't let there be a shadow.

16:21.106 --> 16:24.098
No shadow. No shadow.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.433
Oh, spring is here! Spring is here!

16:30.824 --> 16:36.820
<i>Oh, let's sing a gay little spring song
Let's get together and sing</i>

16:38.331 --> 16:40.413
Oh, that song.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.618
Oh, I'll never be frightened again.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.224
It looks like
I scared the shadow right out of him.

16:59.311 --> 17:02.019
Did you see the look on his...

17:04.107 --> 17:06.314
Hey! Hey, hey!

17:09.863 --> 17:13.401
Where's everybody going?
Forest on fire?

17:15.076 --> 17:16.907
Who are you?

17:16.994 --> 17:21.990
Name's Ronno,
and these are the boys, Stab and Jab.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.035
Well, I hope the three of you
have a nice day.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.622
I wouldn't go that way if I were you.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.457
That's where I saw a man.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.919
You saw a man?

17:36.890 --> 17:40.224
There I was, out in the meadow.

17:40.310 --> 17:44.599
Suddenly, I heard this voice
luring me in.

17:44.689 --> 17:48.432
"I'm here, I'm here."

17:48.985 --> 17:54.651
See, man's got this stick that can
make his voice sound like one of us.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.449
But I'm way too smart for that,

17:57.535 --> 18:00.197
so I crept up on him,

18:00.288 --> 18:02.450
real quiet.

18:05.001 --> 18:09.211
Then barn! I knocked him out
with my trusty antlers.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.879
That's quite a story.

18:14.970 --> 18:17.302
You think so?

18:17.389 --> 18:19.300
It's unbelievable.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.723
Yeah. Unbelievable.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.973
- You calling me a liar?
- No.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.805
- You wanna spar, do you?
- No!

18:27.899 --> 18:30.015
Clobber him, Bambi.

18:30.110 --> 18:33.148
Bambi? Isn't that a girl's name?

18:34.531 --> 18:36.568
Come on. Let's go.

18:36.658 --> 18:40.401
Just a little, friendly competition.

18:40.495 --> 18:43.112
Ronno!

18:43.206 --> 18:47.040
- Coming, Mother.
- Yeah. Maybe you should get going.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.665
Jeez, I was only
playing around with him.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.792
Isn't that right, Bambi?

18:52.882 --> 18:55.590
- Ronn0!
- I'm coming!

18:55.677 --> 18:58.419
Ma! How many times
do I have to tell you?

18:58.513 --> 19:01.255
Don't bother me
when I'm trying to make new friends.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.931
Sorry, dear.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.929
You big mama's boy!

19:05.020 --> 19:07.182
Why don't you run home
to your mama?

19:07.272 --> 19:09.229
You big old mama's boy!

19:09.316 --> 19:11.182
Thumper!

19:11.276 --> 19:12.892
Coming, Mama.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.977
Gotta go. See you, Bambi.

19:15.071 --> 19:18.359
So tell me,
what did the groundhog see?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.817
See you, Bambi.

19:21.995 --> 19:27.286
- Do you want us to walk you home?
- No. My father's coming for me.

19:27.375 --> 19:31.289
Well, it was nice
to see you again, Bambi.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.363
Bambi.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.000
Mother?

21:06.474 --> 21:08.761
I miss you so much.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.135
There, there.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.893
It's going to be all right. You'll see.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.941
Why did you have to go?

21:18.027 --> 21:21.270
Everything in the forest has its season.

21:21.364 --> 21:25.232
Where one thing falls, another grows.

21:25.326 --> 21:27.454
Maybe not what was there before,

21:27.537 --> 21:31.747
but something new and wonderful,
all the same.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.744
But I feel so alone.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.621
I'm always with you.

21:35.712 --> 21:39.797
Even when you can't see me, I'm here.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.715
I'm here.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.008
I'm here.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.216
I'm here.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.017
Hello.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.642
Hello?

21:56.524 --> 21:58.515
I'm here.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.232
Mother?

22:02.322 --> 22:04.359
It's me.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.067
I'm here.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.992
Hello.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.994
I'm here.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.499
Wait! I'm coming.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.808
Hello?

22:38.650 --> 22:41.108
Hello.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.937
I'm here.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.193
It's me.

22:48.368 --> 22:51.451
- Mother?
- I'm here.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.079
Hello.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.495
Hello.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.667
I'm here.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.519
Bambi!

23:31.119 --> 23:32.234
Run, Bambi!

23:53.433 --> 23:54.468
Run, Bambi!

23:55.310 --> 23:57.096
Go! Now!

24:13.077 --> 24:15.694
But it was Mother. I heard her voice.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.326
- It was one of man's tricks.
- I'm sorry.

24:19.417 --> 24:23.376
What if I hadn't gotten there in time?
You could have been...

24:23.463 --> 24:28.879
When I tell you to run, you run.
Never freeze like that, ever!

24:28.968 --> 24:32.131
I'm sorry.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.807
Let's go home.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.378
She's never coming back, is she?

25:13.763 --> 25:15.595
No.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.627
Friend Owl.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.142
Winter is coming to an end.

25:59.225 --> 26:05.016
You should have little trouble
finding a new home for Bambi.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.775
Big brother!

26:15.283 --> 26:18.321
Oh, big brother!

26:20.371 --> 26:22.578
Big brother!

26:26.794 --> 26:30.037
Every time we turn our backs,
he's gone.

26:30.131 --> 26:34.546
Search everywhere.
Leave no stone unturned.

26:40.475 --> 26:43.263
How come we're hiding
from your sisters?

26:44.604 --> 26:49.189
- I think they're sweet.
- Well, you don't have to live with them.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.277
Back up.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.946
Watch it!

26:57.784 --> 26:59.775
Come on! Push harder!

27:04.415 --> 27:06.793
So, where are we off to today?

27:06.876 --> 27:09.709
You're going to stay near the den,
where it's safe.

27:09.796 --> 27:13.790
But I'm ready for danger,
for adventure, for...

27:13.883 --> 27:15.624
The den.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.959
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.295
I'll stay and guard the den.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.438
Hey, Bambi.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.146
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.733
Come on.
You can tell your bestest friend.

27:40.827 --> 27:45.867
Well, my father
never takes me with him anymore.

27:45.957 --> 27:50.542
I guess I'm not
what a prince's son is supposed to be.

27:50.628 --> 27:54.041
- If I could just show him.
- Show him what?

27:54.131 --> 27:56.919
That I can be brave like him.

27:59.387 --> 28:03.597
If that's all it is, being brave is easy.

28:03.683 --> 28:06.015
- I can teach you.
- You can?

28:06.102 --> 28:08.434
Sure. Watch this.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.523
I think he's got a hairball.

28:14.610 --> 28:18.023
No, I'm being brave, silly.

28:18.114 --> 28:22.733
The trick is to be scarier
than whatever's scaring you. See?

28:28.249 --> 28:30.206
You look like a squirrel.

28:30.293 --> 28:32.330
Watch me!

28:37.842 --> 28:39.082
Flower!

28:39.176 --> 28:41.964
You just found your inner strength.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.967
0h, gosh!

28:45.057 --> 28:47.799
Okay. Now, stand very straight.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.726
Stick out your chest.

28:49.812 --> 28:53.771
Take the deepest breath
you ever took in your whole life.

28:56.986 --> 29:00.274
Now let it outwith a big grr.

29:03.993 --> 29:07.486
You're gonna need a lot of practice.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.743
Come on. Do what I do.
I'm a mountain lion.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.410
I'm a bear.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.414
I'm a turtle.

29:22.345 --> 29:27.135
What? Turtles are so scary.

29:31.187 --> 29:33.303
Come on. You can do it.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.265
Come on, watch this.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.864
Yeah, that's it. Come on. Try it again.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.368
Yeah. That was good.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.626
Come on, come on!

30:11.894 --> 30:14.056
Yeah, that's it.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.249
Watch this.

30:48.681 --> 30:53.847
See? There's nothing to it.
All it takes is one good grrr.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.061
Porcupine!

30:58.524 --> 31:01.357
Get out and stay out,
you trespassing hooligans.

31:02.361 --> 31:06.275
Trashy, muddy paws.
Couldn't you have anything nice?

31:07.700 --> 31:10.533
Well, we can always swim across.

31:14.457 --> 31:16.448
Let's go before he sees you.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.953
No. This is it.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.874
I can show my dad how brave I am.

31:22.465 --> 31:23.921
You better hurry.

31:29.555 --> 31:32.968
Don't worry. I'll take care of your dad.

31:36.479 --> 31:38.061
And remember what I taught you.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.782
I'm gonna walk across this log.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.245
Get off my property, you pesky squirrel.

31:56.332 --> 32:00.166
I'm not a squirrel. I'm the young prince.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.501
Where you going, princey?

32:02.630 --> 32:04.621
Not this way. Try again.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.918
Help! Help!

32:10.012 --> 32:12.925
There's this thing,
and it's got these eyes,

32:13.015 --> 32:15.598
and these claws like...

32:15.684 --> 32:19.097
And it walks around like this.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.520
And, well, you gotta see it.

32:23.776 --> 32:26.518
Well, come on!

32:28.864 --> 32:31.447
Try again! Try again!

32:31.534 --> 32:34.276
You don't understand.
I have to get across.

32:34.370 --> 32:39.536
Go around. In my day, we didn't wander
willy-nilly onto someone's property.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.283
We took the long way.

32:41.377 --> 32:45.371
It sometimes took days,
weeks, in the pouring rain,

32:45.464 --> 32:47.956
'cause we had a little thing
called respect.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.461
Bambi, you did it!

32:53.556 --> 32:56.014
Yeah? Oh, you did it all right.

32:58.561 --> 32:59.847
Behind you! Look out!

33:03.357 --> 33:04.643
Here I am!

33:06.485 --> 33:07.646
Here I am again!

33:08.654 --> 33:10.986
Hurry up! It's right over here.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.907
Oops. Wrong way. Nothing here.

33:30.426 --> 33:33.669
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything. Probably a bird.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.925
Yeah, that's it. A bird.

33:37.016 --> 33:38.848
Oh, no.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.016
That'll teach you.

33:41.103 --> 33:44.095
Think twice before
you trespass round here again.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.602
Mind your own beeswax next time.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.903
That's the problem
with these kids today.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.155
No respect. No respect at all.

33:58.245 --> 34:01.158
What are you looking at,
you big moose?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.686
Bambi, are you okay?

34:26.899 --> 34:28.105
How does it look?

34:31.570 --> 34:35.529
I'm not gonna lie to you. It ain't pretty.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.074
It's hopeless. I'm a coward.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.697
No. You're brave.

34:40.788 --> 34:45.328
No one's ever got
that far across before.

34:45.833 --> 34:49.202
That's the great thing about me.
I don't feel any pain.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.413
Watch this.

34:55.552 --> 34:58.044
See? Nothing.

34:59.807 --> 35:00.842
What was that?

35:00.933 --> 35:05.177
Probablyjust some poor, dumb animal
caught in a trap. So anyways...

35:06.814 --> 35:08.020
Bambi!

35:08.274 --> 35:11.562
Hey! I wasn't finished talking about me.

35:12.653 --> 35:16.271
- Just one more.
- Bambi, what happened?

35:16.365 --> 35:18.732
Bambi got stuck by a porcupine.

35:18.826 --> 35:21.568
- A porcupine? Where?
- Hold still!

35:21.662 --> 35:23.323
- It was nothing.
- Are you hurt?

35:23.414 --> 35:26.577
- Stop moving!
- I'm fine. Really. lt'sjust...

35:28.544 --> 35:29.909
Got it.

35:30.004 --> 35:33.793
Bambi. I thought
I recognized that scream.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.668
I'm surprised to see you moving.

35:35.759 --> 35:39.297
- It was only a porcupine.
- No, no, no.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.380
I'm talking about
how you froze out on the meadow,

35:42.474 --> 35:45.307
and right in front of your father.

35:45.394 --> 35:48.307
- Ronn0!
- Don't feel bad.

35:48.397 --> 35:53.142
If we didn't have cowards,
we couldn't tell who the brave ones are.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.112
I'm not a coward.

35:58.115 --> 36:01.824
Yeah, sure. Come on. Let's go.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.698
- I'm staying here.
- Come on.

36:04.788 --> 36:08.907
- Ronno, quit it.
- Leave her alone.

36:09.001 --> 36:12.869
Did you say something, Bambi?

36:12.963 --> 36:14.624
No. Well...

36:14.715 --> 36:16.831
I mean, yes.

36:17.926 --> 36:21.214
Leave her alone. Please?

36:21.305 --> 36:22.921
You tell him, Bambi.

36:23.015 --> 36:27.930
Oh, wook. It's the wittle bunny
and the wittle skunk.

36:28.020 --> 36:32.184
Does the young prince play with
the wittle bunny and the wittle skunk?

36:37.363 --> 36:38.478
Run!

36:42.242 --> 36:44.529
Run, Bambi!

37:01.387 --> 37:03.549
Other way! Other way!

37:04.640 --> 37:07.223
Turn around! Turn around!

37:18.445 --> 37:20.732
We made it.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.366
What's the matter?

37:25.452 --> 37:26.863
Too scared?

37:27.996 --> 37:31.079
Look at him. Look at him shaking.

37:31.166 --> 37:35.000
Now who's the baby, you big baby?

37:38.424 --> 37:39.585
Hello.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.461
I told you to stay near the den.

37:41.552 --> 37:45.591
When I give you an order,
I expect you to...

37:46.849 --> 37:48.431
How did you...

37:49.935 --> 37:51.926
Did you jump?

37:52.980 --> 37:54.391
Yes, sir.

37:55.566 --> 37:58.524
I didn't make a jump like that
until I had antlers.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.362
Yes. Well...

38:12.416 --> 38:15.329
We should be going

38:17.045 --> 38:18.297
home.

38:19.214 --> 38:22.377
He's never said
anything nice like that before.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.550
I guess he saw how brave you were.

38:25.220 --> 38:29.054
Gosh, what a jump. It was like flying.

38:29.141 --> 38:33.351
What's the big deal?
Anyone can make thatjump.

38:51.497 --> 38:54.990
Come on.
You jumped further than this yesterday.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.825
I don't know.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.582
You're not afraid, are you?

39:01.757 --> 39:05.000
You're too afraid. You cannotjump...

39:14.686 --> 39:16.597
- You did it.
- Let's do it again.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.596
And this time put it out further.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.064
Come on, Bambi. You can do it.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.609
Wait till your dad sees this.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.364
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Owl.

39:28.450 --> 39:33.115
Just thought I'd let you know
that the search is off to a flying start.

39:33.914 --> 39:34.949
Yes, well,

39:35.082 --> 39:37.289
no pun intended,

39:37.376 --> 39:41.461
with the flying, as I'm an owl.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.963
Yes, well.

39:45.050 --> 39:49.044
I've met with several does already
who would make excellent mothers.

39:49.137 --> 39:54.553
- Put it out further!
- Unless you've changed your mind?

39:54.643 --> 39:57.305
No, I have not.

39:58.772 --> 40:01.730
Hey, watch this! Watch this!

40:02.943 --> 40:06.982
- Did I make it?
- Yep. You did it.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.074
- What exactly are you doing?
- I'm practicing myjumps.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.992
Yeah. See?

40:14.997 --> 40:16.783
I see.

40:21.128 --> 40:24.996
I don't get it.
Yesterday he really liked it.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.832
What's he doing, anyway?

40:27.968 --> 40:31.677
I don't know,
but he sure does an awful lot of it.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.504
Well, why don't you ask him?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.678
Oh, he looks busy. I better not.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.510
Parents like it
when you ask them questions,

40:39.646 --> 40:42.434
lots and lots of questions.

40:42.524 --> 40:46.188
- Really?
- Go on. I'm right behind you.

41:05.213 --> 41:08.376
- What are you doing?
- Observing.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.125
Observing.

41:13.055 --> 41:16.548
- What's observing?
- Well, it's...

41:17.559 --> 41:19.391
It's...

41:20.729 --> 41:22.561
It's difficult to explain.

41:27.402 --> 41:30.235
You have to look, listen,

41:30.864 --> 41:33.572
and smell, all at the same time.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.650
I can do that.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.735
Look, listen, smell.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.243
Try to feel the forest around you.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.549
I don't feel anything.

41:53.595 --> 41:57.179
- Does playing in the meadow.
- How do you know?

41:57.265 --> 41:59.677
I feel it in my hooves.

41:59.768 --> 42:04.353
If there was danger, they'd know
to stomp, and I'd run to them.

42:04.439 --> 42:08.933
- But wouldn't you be scared?
- Perhaps, but I would still run to them.

42:09.027 --> 42:14.943
A prince may be afraid, but he can't
let fear stop him from acting.

42:15.075 --> 42:18.113
Wow. You know everything.

42:19.788 --> 42:21.370
Not everything.

42:22.958 --> 42:25.950
Well, the forest is waiting.

42:32.092 --> 42:33.298
Are you coming?

42:35.804 --> 42:36.919
Sure!

42:43.437 --> 42:45.144
- Big brother!
- Big brother!

42:45.272 --> 42:47.980
Oh, for crying out loud!

42:48.108 --> 42:50.975
Feel the forest. Feel the forest.

42:51.111 --> 42:52.977
- Feel the forest.
- Bambi!

42:53.113 --> 42:55.650
Feel the...

42:55.782 --> 42:57.568
Felt it.

43:04.583 --> 43:08.668
<i>Why does winter
always make you wait</i>

43:08.795 --> 43:12.504
<i>For a glimpse of sun?</i>

43:12.632 --> 43:16.591
<i>Takes a simple clue or leap of faith</i>

43:16.678 --> 43:19.511
<i>To know the time will come</i>

43:19.598 --> 43:22.681
<i>When long, cold nights</i>

43:22.809 --> 43:27.349
<i>Fade into memory
looking at the morning light</i>

43:27.439 --> 43:33.025
<i>And we will be together</i>

43:33.153 --> 43:36.691
<i>Leaving our cares behind forever</i>

43:36.823 --> 43:39.861
<i>At the first sign of spring</i>

43:39.993 --> 43:44.783
<i>The heat of the sun
will shine right through</i>

43:44.873 --> 43:48.707
<i>And never a moment comes too soon</i>

43:48.835 --> 43:52.499
<i>As the first sign of spring</i>

44:00.680 --> 44:04.799
<i>Air is getting warmer by the day</i>

44:04.893 --> 44:07.806
<i>As the thaw begins</i>

44:08.855 --> 44:12.564
<i>So put a corner on this page</i>

44:12.651 --> 44:15.643
<i>The leaves are green again</i>

44:15.737 --> 44:17.478
<i>And cloudy skies</i>

44:17.572 --> 44:19.404
I hear it, I hear it!

44:19.533 --> 44:23.492
<i>Are lifting away
right in front of our very eyes</i>

44:23.578 --> 44:29.574
<i>And we will be together</i>

44:33.088 --> 44:36.001
<i>At the first sign of spring</i>

44:43.014 --> 44:45.267
When will I get my antlers?

44:46.393 --> 44:49.886
Won't be long now
if you're anything like I was.

44:50.397 --> 44:51.603
Am I?

44:51.731 --> 44:54.894
Well, only one way to find out.

45:00.782 --> 45:02.614
Wow!

45:02.742 --> 45:05.780
<i>At the first sign of spring</i>

45:07.789 --> 45:11.532
<i>A new season's begun</i>

45:11.626 --> 45:15.290
<i>For a father and son</i>

45:15.380 --> 45:19.294
<i>And everything grows a little faster</i>

45:19.426 --> 45:23.465
<i>And every moment stretches longer</i>

45:23.597 --> 45:28.592
<i>And it will only get much stronger</i>

45:30.729 --> 45:35.565
<i>We will be together</i>

45:35.650 --> 45:39.564
<i>Leaving our cares behind forever</i>

45:39.654 --> 45:42.316
<i>At the first sign of spring</i>

45:42.449 --> 45:47.068
<i>The heat of the sun
will shine right through</i>

45:47.621 --> 45:51.910
<i>Never a moment comes too soon</i>

45:52.000 --> 45:55.493
<i>As the first sign of spring</i>

45:55.629 --> 45:58.621
<i>At the first sign of spring</i>

45:59.591 --> 46:05.678
<i>At the first sign of spring</i>

46:25.659 --> 46:28.492
Bambi, time to go to sleep.

46:29.204 --> 46:32.117
But I can't sleep. I'm wide awake.

46:32.207 --> 46:33.868
Try.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.207
Okay, I'll try.

46:39.965 --> 46:42.127
It was funny
when you chased that cricket,

46:42.217 --> 46:44.379
then there was one more,
then one more.

46:44.511 --> 46:46.718
Yes, yes.

46:46.846 --> 46:49.224
Now, get some sleep.

46:51.017 --> 46:53.975
Flower sleeps all winter.

46:54.062 --> 46:55.302
Why do we sleep?

46:55.647 --> 46:58.230
Everything must get rest.

46:58.358 --> 47:02.022
Some at night, some during the day.

47:03.238 --> 47:05.650
Some not at all.

47:11.371 --> 47:13.578
Mother's resting now, isn't she?

47:13.707 --> 47:15.323
Oh, I forgot.

47:15.417 --> 47:19.911
A prince leaves the past
in the past, right?

47:23.675 --> 47:26.087
That's enough questions for today.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.918
Now, please get some sleep.

47:28.054 --> 47:30.045
Okay.

47:31.016 --> 47:32.757
Good night.

48:17.604 --> 48:20.221
Come on, sleepyhead.

48:20.315 --> 48:24.809
Remind me never to let you
eat blossoms before bedtime.

48:24.944 --> 48:26.981
Wait. I hear trouble.

48:27.072 --> 48:28.654
What? What?

48:28.782 --> 48:31.149
Hornet nest, antler-high.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.496
Very good.

48:34.621 --> 48:38.410
- Wait! Now I see trouble.
- Where? Where?

48:38.500 --> 48:40.741
Rival stag, dead ahead.

48:40.835 --> 48:43.918
He's pretty small.
Shouldn't be any trouble.

48:44.005 --> 48:46.997
Oh, yeah? I can be plenty of trouble.

48:47.133 --> 48:50.467
- No, not you.
- Yes, me.

48:51.679 --> 48:53.932
Now you've had it.

48:55.308 --> 48:56.423
Gotcha!

48:56.518 --> 48:58.680
Now who's got who?

49:00.438 --> 49:03.681
- There you two are. Well, yes.
- Hello, Friend Owl.

49:03.817 --> 49:05.774
Well, hello.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.943
I've been meaning to speak to you.

49:09.030 --> 49:12.694
I've been looking everywhere.
I thought you'd be by the meadow now.

49:12.826 --> 49:15.534
I'm afraid I got a little

49:16.663 --> 49:17.869
distracted.

49:17.997 --> 49:22.537
So I see. Well, no matter.
I usually find what I'm after.

49:22.627 --> 49:27.212
Speaking of which,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

49:27.340 --> 49:29.957
- Mena.
- Great Prince.

49:30.051 --> 49:32.543
- Bambi, go to the den.
- Bambi.

49:32.679 --> 49:34.966
I've heard so much about you.

49:35.056 --> 49:36.638
You know, your mama and I
grew up together.

49:36.724 --> 49:38.806
- You did?
- Go to the den.

49:38.893 --> 49:40.634
But I want to hear about Mother.

49:40.728 --> 49:44.642
There'll be plenty of time for that
once you're settled in your new home.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.479
You're sending me away?

49:48.570 --> 49:50.982
No. Just let me explain.

49:51.072 --> 49:53.234
But I did everything you said.

49:53.366 --> 49:57.155
- I even heard with my hooves.
- Bambi, a prince does not...

49:57.245 --> 50:00.328
- That's all you care about, not me.
- Don't speak to me...

50:00.415 --> 50:03.703
I wish Mother was here instead of you!

50:06.588 --> 50:11.173
Oh, my. Well, I've certainly
made a muddle of things.

50:11.259 --> 50:13.250
No. This is my fault.

50:14.387 --> 50:16.594
Bambi needs a mother.

50:16.681 --> 50:20.174
A prince should not be raising a child.

50:27.609 --> 50:30.192
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

50:30.278 --> 50:33.111
Don't worry. We'll see each other again.

50:34.115 --> 50:37.528
We'll come visit you, if it's not too far.

50:37.619 --> 50:40.452
But Mama says it is too far.

50:42.790 --> 50:47.205
And if you get scared, just be scarier
than whatever's scaring you.

50:49.589 --> 50:50.875
Bambi.

50:51.799 --> 50:53.710
It's time to go.

50:53.801 --> 50:56.384
I'll never forget any of you.

50:56.471 --> 51:01.386
Of course not.
Can't forget your bestest friend.

51:04.646 --> 51:07.263
Being a prince means sacrifice.

51:08.316 --> 51:10.808
He must ignore his feelings

51:10.944 --> 51:13.811
and do what is best for others.

51:14.656 --> 51:16.238
Do you understand?

51:18.284 --> 51:20.491
I'll visit you soon.

51:20.620 --> 51:22.406
Be good for Mena.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.662
And never forget,

51:28.753 --> 51:31.666
you are a prince.

52:41.075 --> 52:42.986
Hello, Princess.

52:44.329 --> 52:47.492
You're not leaving
without saying goodbye?

52:47.582 --> 52:49.994
And I thought we were pals.

52:50.084 --> 52:52.917
I feel for you. Gosh, I really do.

52:53.004 --> 52:56.668
It's gotta be hard to have a father
that's so ashamed of you

52:56.758 --> 52:58.999
that he'd give you away.

53:05.391 --> 53:07.177
0h, yeah?

53:10.229 --> 53:11.390
Bambi!

53:21.949 --> 53:24.361
Bambi! Are you all right?

53:38.966 --> 53:41.378
Both of you get out of here. Now!

53:41.469 --> 53:43.460
Mommy!

53:45.056 --> 53:46.296
Bambi, run!

53:54.107 --> 53:55.939
Run, Bambi!

54:01.489 --> 54:04.572
Faster, Bambi.
Don't look back! Keep running!

54:04.659 --> 54:06.821
Keep running!

54:14.168 --> 54:15.329
Bambi!

54:34.522 --> 54:37.139
Where's Bambi?

54:49.370 --> 54:51.452
Look! It's Bambi!

54:54.167 --> 54:57.376
We gotta help him.
Make your brave face.

54:57.503 --> 55:00.370
- This one?
- Braver!

55:00.506 --> 55:03.874
- This one?
- No, no.

55:04.010 --> 55:07.628
Make the bravest face
you ever made in your whole life.

55:07.722 --> 55:09.463
This one?

55:12.560 --> 55:15.177
That's the one.

55:36.167 --> 55:40.081
Looky who's here. I guess
somebody didn't learn their lesson.

55:40.171 --> 55:41.582
I learned plenty.

57:35.661 --> 57:37.493
Bambi!

58:09.320 --> 58:10.401
Bambi!

58:23.334 --> 58:25.166
Bambi?

58:26.754 --> 58:28.870
Get up.

58:30.049 --> 58:31.835
Get up!

58:31.926 --> 58:34.213
A prince does not...

59:26.647 --> 59:28.479
Dad.

59:33.112 --> 59:34.568
I'm here.

59:36.574 --> 59:38.781
I'm here.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.769
It was raining and thundering.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.194
It didn't look good for the young prince.

01:00:16.322 --> 01:00:19.280
There were thousands of dogs,

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.949
but Bambi wasn't a bit scared.

01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:25.119
They came closer and closer.

01:00:25.206 --> 01:00:28.039
There was nowhere to go.

01:00:29.502 --> 01:00:34.292
Then a dog that was tall as a tree
roared from the shadows,

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.042
but Bambi was too fast.

01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:38.883
- Hejumped up...
- High in the air.

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:42.629
- And then came crashing...
- Crashing down.

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:45.215
Right on the big dog's head.

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:49.470
Quiet. I'm telling it.
But the best part was...

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.224
The best part was when Thumper

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:54.307
helped Flower make
his bravest brave face.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:58.019
- And scared all the dogs away. Oops.
- And scared all the dogs away. Oops.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:01.147
That's how it went.

01:01:01.242 --> 01:01:03.404
Hooray for Thumper!

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:05.906
- Look who's here.
- Oh, the young prince.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.249
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:10.994
You know, they're okay for sisters.

01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:14.248
- Just too bad they're girls.
- Hey!

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.257
Oops.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.707
What do you know, Bambi!

01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:27.098
Well, looks like
those antlers are finally coming in.

01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:29.388
Really? I hadn't noticed.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.512
Thumper's been telling us quite a story.

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:36.440
Yes, yes.
The one with the thousands of dogs.

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:38.359
Thousands?

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:41.858
What can I say? I'm a born storyteller.

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:44.111
I'll bet it seemed like a thousand dogs.

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.870
Twitterpated.

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:56.293
What's twitterpated?

01:01:56.422 --> 01:02:01.041
Well, it's...
I'll tell you when you're older.

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:04.719
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the young prince.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:07.797
One of these days we'll meet up again,
and when we do...

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:19.976
Get it off! Get it off! Mommy! Get it off!

01:02:20.112 --> 01:02:22.149
Mommy!

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:27.989
See? I told you turtles were scary.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:34.991
I gotta get going.
My dad's waiting for me.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.463
- Bye, Bambi.
- Bye, Bambi.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:42.999
Bambi, you never have time
for us anymore.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.630
Yeah. Isn't it wonderful?

01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:52.592
Hey, Dad. Where are we going today?

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.018
We're already there.

01:03:12.039 --> 01:03:13.200
Wow.

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:16.115
I never even knew this was here.

01:03:16.877 --> 01:03:19.209
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.389
This is...

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.805
This is where I first met your mother.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:39.305
- Really?
- Yes.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.687
I was just about your age.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.479
What were you like?

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:50.191
Me? Well, let me think.

01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:56.247
Actually, I was a lot like you.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:03.831
<i>For it's out of the darkness
that we learn to see</i>

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:08.509
<i>And out of the silence
that songs come to be</i>

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:15.183
<i>And all that we dream of
awaits patiently</i>

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:21.015
<i>There is life</i>

01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:23.349
<i>There is</i>

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:29.440
<i>There is life</i>

01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:04.941
<i>Look at that cloud</i>

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.489
<i>As high as a tree</i>

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:14.234
<i>At least that's how it looks to me</i>

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:20.615
<i>How about you?</i>

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:23.576
<i>What do you see?</i>

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:30.667
<i>What if we see things differently?</i>

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.173
<i>Show me</i>

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:39.847
<i>How the world looks through your eyes</i>

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:43.271
<i>Tell me about the sunrise</i>

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:46.850
<i>Let me see the stars shine</i>

01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:49.363
<i>Show me</i>

01:05:49.488 --> 01:05:54.779
<i>How the world looks through your eyes</i>

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:59.954
<i>And I can show you
how it looks through mine</i>

01:06:07.214 --> 01:06:09.205
<i>If I had wings</i>

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.712
<i>And I could fly</i>

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:19.049
<i>I would tell you all about the sky</i>

01:06:21.854 --> 01:06:24.516
<i>How about you?</i>

01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:27.898
<i>If dreams came true</i>

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:35.153
<i>What do you imagine you could do?</i>

01:06:35.242 --> 01:06:38.485
<i>Oh, show me</i>
