WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:06.207
(suspenseful orchestral music)

00:27.928 --> 00:30.664
(fire crackling)

00:36.870 --> 00:39.540
- [Witch] They're coming for me.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.782
I will never forget.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.922
I will never forgive.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.593
(screaming)

01:06.334 --> 01:08.602
I will live on.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.073
(low rumbling)

01:16.744 --> 01:19.347
(low thudding)

01:21.615 --> 01:25.286
(dramatic orchestral music)

02:54.842 --> 02:56.510
- Come along, Chloe.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.014
We're almost there.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.716
- I want to go home.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.784
- We can't.

03:03.817 --> 03:04.652
- Why?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.055
- It isn't safe anymore.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.757
- I want to go home.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.829
- Be brave, Chloe, please.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.467
This is our new home.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.768
- No, it's not.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.441
- [Arthur] Mrs. Gray.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.348
- You must be Arthur.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.750
- [Arthur] It's good
to meet you, Mrs. Gray.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.286
- Please, Adeline.

03:40.354 --> 03:43.190
- Is everything all right?

03:43.223 --> 03:47.227
- Hiding behind that tree
is my daughter, Chloe.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.700
She's not accustomed
to such change.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.168
She left so much behind.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.704
- She's not alone.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.208
We just have to
keep moving forward.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.743
- I'm so sorry we're late.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.977
- [Arthur] Don't be.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.213
We don't claim to
be easy to find.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.015
- Are we close to the house?

04:08.048 --> 04:09.283
- Very.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.150
This way.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.757
Have you come far?

04:16.790 --> 04:17.925
- Kent.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.594
Our street was bombed
three days ago.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.263
It's no place for a
child at the moment.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.999
- Sounds like you were
lucky to get out alive.

04:26.033 --> 04:26.867
- We were.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.570
- Well, you'll be
as far out of sight

04:29.603 --> 04:31.705
as it is possible to be here.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.474
You'll be staying at
the village's oldest

04:33.507 --> 04:35.242
and most secluded building.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.511
There are even
some in the village

04:37.545 --> 04:41.214
who are unaware of the
house in the woods.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.149
Here we are.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.384
(suspenseful orchestral music)

04:43.417 --> 04:45.052
Brynhill Manor.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.355
- [Adeline] Manor?

04:47.388 --> 04:49.823
- [Arthur] Not what
you were expecting?

04:49.857 --> 04:53.594
- You never mentioned we were
staying at a manor house.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.397
- I thought I
would surprise you.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.342
(whispering)

05:12.680 --> 05:15.416
(door unlocking)

05:22.055 --> 05:24.825
It has been vacant
for some time.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.131
- It's so vast,

05:32.966 --> 05:33.801
so cold.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.270
- You'll find blankets
in your bedrooms,

05:37.304 --> 05:39.139
lanterns too.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.542
- How can you expect
us to stay here?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.777
- It's all I have to offer.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.579
- Then we will look elsewhere.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.948
- There's nowhere else here.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.252
The next village
is an hour's walk.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.086
- But it's--

05:53.120 --> 05:54.888
- All you can afford.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.693
It's a roof over your
heads, nevertheless.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.864
Shall we continue?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.236
I'll show you around.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.942
- Unpack your bag, Chloe.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.544
- But, Mommy.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.746
- Unpack your bag, please.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.657
- My father bought the
manor many years ago

06:29.690 --> 06:33.093
with the aim of turning
it into our family home,

06:33.126 --> 06:36.697
but he died before he ever
had a chance to complete it.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.467
I've had some generous offers
to take it off my hands,

06:39.500 --> 06:42.836
but, in the end, I've
rejected them all.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.939
I realized that deep down,

06:45.973 --> 06:50.077
I didn't have the heart to
part with it permanently.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.449
- Why have you let us stay here.

06:55.483 --> 06:58.418
- This place has so
much unknown history,

06:58.452 --> 07:03.724
so much mystique that it had
intended to remain untouched,

07:03.757 --> 07:06.760
but your letter opened my eyes.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.030
I knew it was finally time
to reopen these doors.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.703
It's ready for a new
chapter, a new purpose,

07:15.736 --> 07:16.837
a new family.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.340
I've installed a bed
for you in there

07:20.373 --> 07:22.810
and another one
for Chloe in there.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.245
(door slamming)

07:25.278 --> 07:28.816
(ominous orchestral music)

07:28.849 --> 07:30.183
- What was that?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.856
- [Arthur] It's locked.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.426
- Where does this door lead?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.494
- [Arthur] To the east wing.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.762
- What' down there?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.732
- Not much, it's
fallen into disrepair.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.934
- Do you have the key?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.435
- Not on me, I'm afraid.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.538
- But you have dozens
of keys in your pockets.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.539
Surely one of them is--

07:51.572 --> 07:53.974
- I don't have it, Mrs. Gray.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.577
- All right.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.652
We were hoping to be
here for six months,

08:04.685 --> 08:06.353
maybe more.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.723
- You can stay here
as long as you need.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.927
- Would you like
to discuss payment?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.796
I can only offer five
shillings a week.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.197
- I won't accept a penny.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.499
- No, I'm not asking
for any charity.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.701
I will pay my way.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.336
- Mrs. Gray, I
only want to help.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.875
- Thank you, Arthur.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.848
(dreamy orchestral music)

08:40.721 --> 08:42.289
- I'm so cold, Mom.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.561
- Better?

08:51.431 --> 08:52.265
It's okay.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.435
They can't hurt us here.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.607
- Are we ever going back?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.108
Are we ever going home?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.611
- Of course we are, sweetheart.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.213
The war must come to an end.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.080
- When?

09:10.718 --> 09:13.220
- It's impossible to say.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.255
For the meantime,

09:15.288 --> 09:18.859
promise me you'll make
the best of it here.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.196
Didn't I always tell
you that one day,

09:23.230 --> 09:26.533
we'd have a big
house and garden?

09:26.566 --> 09:30.638
Imagine the games of hide and
seek we could play out there.

09:30.671 --> 09:34.507
There must be a thousand
trees to hide behind.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.114
How can I make this up to you?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.182
- [Chloe] You can't.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.050
- Why?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.520
Talk to me, please.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.624
- I miss him so much.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.233
- I know you do,

10:01.501 --> 10:03.270
but you're not alone.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.205
You have me.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.240
One day--

10:07.274 --> 10:08.776
- Don't say it.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.610
- What are you talking about?

10:10.644 --> 10:12.112
- Don't say it.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.380
- Say what?

10:13.413 --> 10:14.247
- Please.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.250
- One day we'll all be reunited.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.552
One day Daddy will come home.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.587
- No!

10:20.620 --> 10:21.955
- Daddy is coming home.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.490
- [Chloe] No, he isn't.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.858
- How can you say that?

10:24.892 --> 10:26.159
- Stop lying to yourself.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.128
He's never coming home.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.140
- I'm so sorry.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.317
Goodnight, Chloe.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.347
(knocking)

11:26.486 --> 11:29.056
(wind rushing)

11:32.559 --> 11:35.028
(glass shattering)

11:35.062 --> 11:38.631
(ominous orchestral music)

11:48.508 --> 11:52.012
(eerie atmospheric music)

12:11.698 --> 12:15.202
(eerie atmospheric music)

12:39.759 --> 12:42.529
(floor creaking)

12:44.097 --> 12:48.268
(ominous orchestral
music rising)

13:03.350 --> 13:05.752
(sighing)

13:05.785 --> 13:07.120
What am I doing?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.448
- Are you all right, Mrs. Gray.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.586
- Yes, this is all just
a bit of an adjustment,

13:39.619 --> 13:40.553
that's all.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.124
- Is there anything I can do.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.425
- No, Mr. Harper.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.794
You've been generous enough.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.965
There's a lot on my
mind, that's all.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.536
- You fear he's not coming back?

14:01.875 --> 14:05.278
- I can't bear the
thought of losing him.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.882
- Does he write to you?

14:08.916 --> 14:09.749
- Often.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.954
We were trying for another
child when he left.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.089
We were discussing names.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.761
- I'm sure he misses
you both terribly.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.966
- Chloe needs her
father more than ever.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.707
Do you ever get
lonely down here?

14:37.777 --> 14:38.778
- Sometimes.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.216
- [Adeline] Are you married?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.919
- I'm a widower.

14:47.854 --> 14:48.855
- I'm sorry.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.062
- She lived more in 30 years,

14:55.095 --> 14:57.530
than many would in a century.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.975
- How can you
stand it, the loss?

15:10.877 --> 15:14.281
- How you deal with loss
defines the rest of your life.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.784
(dramatic orchestral music)

15:17.817 --> 15:21.989
It can make you stronger
or it can tear you apart.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.493
I choose to accept that
loss will hurt us all

15:26.526 --> 15:27.860
sooner or later,

15:32.265 --> 15:35.768
but if you let it, life will
hold something else for you,

15:36.970 --> 15:40.807
something worth fighting
through the pain for.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
It took me 20 years to see it.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.726
(ominous orchestral music)

16:02.629 --> 16:05.032
(whispering)

16:06.399 --> 16:07.234
- Mom?

16:13.573 --> 16:16.909
(footsteps approaching)

16:26.453 --> 16:28.288
- It's time to get up.

16:35.062 --> 16:35.895
Chloe?

16:41.901 --> 16:44.737
(vase shattering)

16:53.280 --> 16:56.015
(woman laughing)

17:04.657 --> 17:05.492
Chloe?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.797
You had me worried sick.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.665
Why didn't you answer?

17:14.867 --> 17:15.702
Chloe?

17:20.273 --> 17:23.376
I haven't seen this one before.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.011
She's rather scary.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.114
- Don't.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.317
Don't touch her.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.823
- Is she one of yours?

17:36.856 --> 17:37.957
- [Chloe] No.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.494
- What's her name?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.597
- I don't know.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.200
- Well, choose one.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.475
Where did she come from?

17:58.010 --> 17:59.612
- I can't tell you.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.917
- You can't tell me?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.424
Who told you that?

18:15.262 --> 18:17.464
She told you that.

18:17.497 --> 18:21.668
(ominous orchestral
music rising)

18:25.205 --> 18:26.873
That's not possible.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.909
You know that, don't you?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.345
She's not alive.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.981
(low thudding)

18:37.850 --> 18:38.985
What have you done with it?

18:39.018 --> 18:40.520
- I haven't moved.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.426
- [Adeline] All right.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.166
(banging)

18:59.306 --> 19:02.909
(dramatic orchestral music)

19:09.949 --> 19:13.953
We all see things when
we need more sleep.

19:13.986 --> 19:14.887
- Even you?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.191
- [Adeline] Yes.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.560
- Okay.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.166
(whispering)

20:13.680 --> 20:16.349
(door creaking)

20:18.618 --> 20:22.422
(eerie atmospheric music)

20:22.455 --> 20:24.891
(whispering)

20:27.394 --> 20:31.331
(eerie atmospheric screeching)

20:35.802 --> 20:38.204
(whispering)

20:42.008 --> 20:45.778
(dramatic orchestral music)

20:49.516 --> 20:51.718
- [Adeline] Chloe,
come down, please.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.552
- What's going on?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.253
- We're leaving.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.588
- What are you talking about?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.657
- Chloe, come down now.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.725
- [Arthur] You can't.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.327
- We are.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.228
- There's nowhere
else for you to go.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.796
- I found this place, didn't I?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.765
There will be others.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.500
- [Arthur] Tell me why.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.537
- I can't begin to explain.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.904
- [Arthur] Look, I've
done everything I can.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.506
- No, it's not you.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.509
- Then what is it?

21:21.414 --> 21:24.183
- You'll think
I've lost my mind.

21:30.390 --> 21:34.260
We aren't safe here.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.464
- This place is as safe as
any you are likely to find.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.066
- That's not true.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.701
- Even if that were the case,

21:41.734 --> 21:43.670
surely you wouldn't risk
your daughter's life

21:43.703 --> 21:46.138
to search for somewhere else.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.014
- Are you sure we're
alone down here.

21:55.047 --> 21:55.882
- Certain.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.986
What makes you think otherwise?

22:08.495 --> 22:10.229
- I don't know.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.499
- I know what
you've been through,

22:12.532 --> 22:15.334
what you've both been through.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.936
Any mind would wander,

22:16.969 --> 22:19.406
but you're in no danger here.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.314
- [Chloe] Let's play a game.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.916
- No, no games.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.084
Slow down, please.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.352
- Hide and seek, hide and seek.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.587
- No.

22:34.621 --> 22:35.422
- Come on.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.288
- Chloe.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.592
Come back.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.094
Come back now.

22:43.396 --> 22:46.298
- [Chloe] I can't
hear you counting.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.501
(sighing)

22:51.604 --> 22:52.639
- [Adeline] Eight,

22:52.672 --> 22:53.640
nine,

22:53.673 --> 22:54.507
10.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.645
Ready or not, I'm
coming to get you.

23:10.757 --> 23:11.591
Okay,

23:12.459 --> 23:14.894
you can come out now.

23:14.927 --> 23:18.498
(ominous orchestral music)

23:19.599 --> 23:20.733
(grunting)

23:20.767 --> 23:22.001
- You gave up.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.570
- [Adeline] Well,
I've got you now.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.972
(laughing)

23:26.005 --> 23:27.173
- Let's play again.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.709
- [Adeline] Well, don't
go so far this time.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.944
- [Chloe] Too late.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.180
- When did you get so fast?

23:34.213 --> 23:36.549
- [Chloe] When did
you get so old?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.551
- Your mine this time.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.587
- [Chloe] Come on, then.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.392
- One,

23:46.425 --> 23:47.960
two,

23:47.994 --> 23:48.828
three,

23:52.765 --> 23:53.600
four,

23:54.467 --> 23:55.267
five,

23:55.301 --> 23:56.102
six,

23:56.135 --> 23:57.136
seven,

23:57.169 --> 23:58.337
eight,

23:58.370 --> 23:59.572
nine,

23:59.606 --> 24:00.372
10.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.510
Ready or not, here I come.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.588
I know I'm close.

24:22.328 --> 24:25.264
You're good, but
I'm not giving up.

24:28.434 --> 24:31.938
(eerie atmospheric music)

24:36.643 --> 24:39.045
(Chloe screaming)

24:39.078 --> 24:39.912
Chloe?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.650
(heart beating)

24:53.860 --> 24:57.797
(eerie atmospheric screeching)

25:03.202 --> 25:05.938
(woman laughing)

25:09.075 --> 25:12.478
(door knocking)

25:12.511 --> 25:13.512
- Mrs. Gray?

25:17.750 --> 25:20.186
I'm Detective Sergeant Nolan.

25:21.487 --> 25:23.422
I understand there's
concerns about your daughter.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.391
- [Adeline] Yes.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.159
- Do you mind if I look around?

25:27.193 --> 25:30.863
(dramatic orchestral music)

25:34.801 --> 25:38.437
- I've searched the
manor seven times over.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.439
She went missing in the woods.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.374
- Yeah, I have five officers
searching the grounds

25:42.408 --> 25:43.409
as we speak.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.013
How long has she been missing?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.547
- Over five hours.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.920
- [Detective Nolan] She ever
run away from home before?

25:53.953 --> 25:55.087
- No,

25:55.121 --> 25:57.189
she would never run away.

25:57.223 --> 26:00.960
- Well, new house,
tensions at home.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.863
- There were no tensions.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.397
- Chloe was happy?

26:14.841 --> 26:16.876
Could she be searching
for her father?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.277
- No.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.979
- Did you actually
see her taken?

26:20.012 --> 26:22.414
- No, but I heard her scream.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.386
- Well, we only have 30 minutes
of daylight left, Mrs. Gray,

26:27.419 --> 26:29.421
so we will continue
our search at dawn.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.891
- You can't stop now, please.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.493
She's out there somewhere.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.529
- And you need to
rest, Mrs. Gray.

26:37.563 --> 26:38.397
- Rest?

26:39.565 --> 26:41.167
My daughter has
been taken from me

26:41.200 --> 26:43.202
and you tell me to rest.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.073
- Goodnight.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.052
- Chloe.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.389
(crow cawing)

27:11.063 --> 27:11.864
Chloe!

27:24.543 --> 27:28.114
(ominous orchestral music)

27:34.153 --> 27:37.589
- [Ghostly Whispering
Voice] She has her.

27:40.827 --> 27:41.828
She has her.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.966
She has your daughter.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.836
- Who has her?

27:55.041 --> 27:55.875
Tell me!

27:58.778 --> 28:02.882
- [Ghostly Whispering Voice]
The witch has her now.

28:05.752 --> 28:09.822
(eerie atmospheric music rising)

28:16.262 --> 28:17.930
- [Detective Nolan] We've
searched the grounds, the woods.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.866
- Have you found Chloe?

28:23.569 --> 28:25.171
Have you found her?

28:26.338 --> 28:27.740
- We have someone
in for question,

28:27.774 --> 28:31.277
which means we're
getting closer.

28:31.310 --> 28:35.214
- You don't have any idea
where she is, do you?

28:37.649 --> 28:39.819
- Time, Mrs. Gray.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.921
We need time to find her.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.858
- Promise me.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.328
- Promise you what?

28:49.361 --> 28:53.265
- Promise me you won't
rest until you find her,

28:54.266 --> 28:55.434
dead or alive.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.771
- We're doing all we can.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.406
- That's not enough.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.976
- Can I have a word, sergeant?

29:16.722 --> 29:18.791
- [Adeline] What
did you say to him?

29:18.825 --> 29:21.427
- Not to waste any more time.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.162
I've knocked on every
door in the village,

29:23.195 --> 29:24.864
no sightings.

29:24.897 --> 29:28.600
No one's even willing to
help look for your girl,

29:28.634 --> 29:30.302
but I'll keep going.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.255
(ominous orchestral music)

29:49.288 --> 29:52.024
(Chloe laughing)

29:59.165 --> 29:59.999
- Chloe!

30:24.090 --> 30:27.326
(door slamming)
(eerie atmospheric music)

30:27.359 --> 30:30.129
(Chloe laughing)

31:00.659 --> 31:03.329
(door creaking)

31:07.833 --> 31:11.603
(Chloe laughing)
(eerie atmospheric music)

31:11.637 --> 31:14.573
(thunder crashing)

31:22.481 --> 31:25.051
(low thudding)

31:56.782 --> 32:00.186
(air raid horn sounding)

32:22.174 --> 32:24.910
(woman laughing)

32:28.480 --> 32:29.315
- Adeline.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.054
What are you doing in here?

32:35.087 --> 32:37.256
- I was looking for Chloe.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.094
I followed her up the stairs.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.996
- That's not possible.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.031
- I saw her.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.067
I heard her footsteps.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.402
- That could've been anything,

32:50.436 --> 32:54.473
shadows on the wall, the
echoes of your own footsteps.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.175
- I heard her voice.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.313
- We are alone here.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.682
Your mind is playing tricks.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.186
She's not here.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.560
- Do you believe I'll find her?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.767
You believe she's dead.

33:23.302 --> 33:26.372
- I still pray for her, for you.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.507
- How can you be so sure?

33:32.144 --> 33:34.146
Who wrote these letters?

33:37.383 --> 33:39.185
Have you read them?

33:39.218 --> 33:42.388
- Those stories are not true.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.023
- She wants us to suffer
as she has suffered.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.025
- I know what she wrote.

33:47.059 --> 33:49.795
- A vengeful witch lives
within these walls.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.063
- [Arthur] It's impossible.

33:51.097 --> 33:54.966
- What if the witch has Chloe.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.935
- These are lies,

33:56.968 --> 33:58.370
every single one.

34:01.973 --> 34:02.774
Lies.

34:07.113 --> 34:09.281
(sighing)

34:10.649 --> 34:13.952
Tell me you don't believe
in the supernatural.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.489
- I didn't.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.325
- It's make believe.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.859
- How do you know?

34:23.028 --> 34:24.763
- How can it be true?

34:26.865 --> 34:29.368
She has a history of delusion.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.771
- [Adeline] Who is she?

34:34.340 --> 34:37.008
- Her name is Mary, Mary Thomas.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.547
She lost her husband
a few years ago,

34:41.580 --> 34:46.252
but she would wait by the
window all day, every day

34:46.285 --> 34:47.553
for his return.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.258
She claimed he was
on his way home.

34:54.326 --> 34:58.497
To help her escape her pain,
I suggested she stay here.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.702
Her imagination got
the better of her.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.006
When you're alone and
scared, if you let it,

35:08.039 --> 35:11.109
the mind can conjure
horrific images.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.380
- What happened to her?

35:17.683 --> 35:19.084
- Due to the nature
of her madness,

35:19.117 --> 35:22.921
Mary was sent to a
psychiatric institution.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.391
- But what if Mary was right?

35:26.625 --> 35:29.195
- Come back to reality, please.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.400
- Do you have children?

35:37.336 --> 35:40.071
Do you have any
children, Arthur?

35:44.075 --> 35:44.910
- A boy.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.880
- If there was a chance,

35:50.115 --> 35:52.218
even the smallest chance,

35:53.652 --> 35:55.987
that going down the
darkest of paths

35:56.021 --> 35:59.358
would lead you back
to your missing boy,

36:01.827 --> 36:05.597
would you close the door
to your superstition

36:06.498 --> 36:08.734
or would you walk the path?

36:09.835 --> 36:13.905
(dramatic orchestral music)

36:13.939 --> 36:16.442
- I would do whatever I could.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.380
- This is my reality, Arthur.

36:24.483 --> 36:27.319
Everyone else is
giving up on her.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.557
If she's alive, then
I am her last hope.

36:31.590 --> 36:35.261
- Spirits do not attach
themselves to dolls.

36:36.362 --> 36:38.697
When we die, we go up there.

36:40.165 --> 36:43.101
- Evil can take a
hold of anything.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.846
- Do what is necessary.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.684
Good luck, Adeline.

37:30.382 --> 37:33.719
(footsteps approaching)

37:37.556 --> 37:41.059
(eerie atmospheric music)

38:02.614 --> 38:03.449
- Chloe?

38:40.285 --> 38:41.119
Chloe?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.222
Can you hear me?

38:47.225 --> 38:48.326
(growling)

38:48.360 --> 38:50.929
(low thudding)

38:52.531 --> 38:56.301
(intense orchestral music)

38:56.334 --> 38:59.070
(woman laughing)

39:09.314 --> 39:12.150
(heavy breathing)

39:27.666 --> 39:31.837
(birds chirping)
(wind howling)

39:33.171 --> 39:36.007
(camera flashing)

39:37.709 --> 39:41.212
(eerie atmospheric music)

39:56.695 --> 39:58.630
(Chloe screaming)

39:58.664 --> 40:02.100
(air raid horn sounding)

40:08.006 --> 40:08.974
- Mom!

40:09.007 --> 40:09.808
- Chloe!

40:09.841 --> 40:12.410
(low thudding)

40:22.488 --> 40:25.724
(dramatic piano music)

41:05.897 --> 41:08.634
(Chloe laughing)

41:08.667 --> 41:12.170
(eerie atmospheric music)

41:20.546 --> 41:23.414
(Chloe laughing)

41:23.448 --> 41:26.051
- [Chloe] You finally found me.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.057
- Chloe?

41:34.359 --> 41:35.193
It's me.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.830
- [Chloe] Come closer.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.334
- It's time to go home.

41:44.235 --> 41:46.304
- [Chloe] I want to play.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.040
- We need to go.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.609
- [Chloe] No!

41:50.642 --> 41:51.643
Come closer.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.848
I wanna play a game.

41:56.882 --> 41:57.683
- We're leaving.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.117
We're going home.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.052
(gasping)

42:01.086 --> 42:03.822
(woman laughing)

42:17.002 --> 42:20.772
- [Witch] You can't stop
seeing her, can you?

42:22.674 --> 42:25.410
Your imagination
knows no bounds.

42:29.314 --> 42:33.484
You want to know where your
daughter is, don't you?

42:36.888 --> 42:37.723
- Tell me.

42:38.624 --> 42:40.826
(witch laughing)

42:40.859 --> 42:42.360
- [Witch] Not yet.

42:44.462 --> 42:45.731
- Is she alive.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.869
Tell me where she is.

42:52.170 --> 42:56.074
- [Witch] Where did
you find such bravery?

42:56.107 --> 42:58.109
- Why won't you tell me?

42:59.310 --> 43:00.946
- [Witch] I wanna see
how far you will go

43:00.979 --> 43:02.313
to see her again.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.619
- I'll do anything.

43:09.788 --> 43:11.289
Whatever it takes.

43:18.864 --> 43:19.965
- Look at me.

43:23.201 --> 43:24.135
Look at me.

43:31.309 --> 43:32.143
- I can't.

43:33.211 --> 43:35.947
(witch laughing)

43:37.548 --> 43:40.318
- [Witch] If you
can not face me,

43:41.352 --> 43:43.621
how can you face the truth?

43:46.457 --> 43:49.194
(witch laughing)

43:53.331 --> 43:56.401
You are giving up
on her, aren't you?

44:00.471 --> 44:02.507
- I'm not afraid of you.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.375
- Well, you should be.

44:08.413 --> 44:12.417
- Are you going to tell
me where my daughter is?

44:14.820 --> 44:16.554
Tell me where she is.

44:18.356 --> 44:20.091
I'm not running away.

44:25.831 --> 44:26.898
Where is she?

44:29.267 --> 44:31.737
- [Witch] You are not
ready to know yet.

44:31.770 --> 44:34.339
(low thudding)

44:38.710 --> 44:42.213
(eerie atmospheric music)

44:54.592 --> 44:58.764
- [Arthur] Are you going
to tell me what happened?

45:01.166 --> 45:03.534
- Are you going to believe me?

45:03.568 --> 45:04.402
- Yes.

45:10.241 --> 45:11.576
- It's all true.

45:13.078 --> 45:14.712
(dramatic orchestral music)

45:14.746 --> 45:16.114
Mary was right.

45:16.147 --> 45:19.084
We're not alone down here.

45:19.117 --> 45:21.519
- Have you seen her?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.554
Have you seen the witch?

45:26.958 --> 45:29.928
- She knows where Chloe is.

45:29.961 --> 45:32.130
She's taunting me,

45:32.163 --> 45:36.968
testing me to so how far
I'll take my search for her.

45:37.002 --> 45:40.005
- And do you think
she's killed her?

45:41.506 --> 45:43.674
- I won't allow myself to.

45:50.849 --> 45:51.850
- I'm sorry.

45:54.052 --> 45:55.686
- For what?

45:55.720 --> 45:59.390
- I promised you I would do
everything I could to help you.

45:59.424 --> 46:00.525
I doubted you.

46:01.726 --> 46:04.395
- It's not too late to find her.

46:05.763 --> 46:09.801
I need to know why the
witch has taken my daughter.

46:11.002 --> 46:13.972
Mary's letters, I
need to read them,

46:18.944 --> 46:19.945
all of them.

46:40.665 --> 46:41.499
Help me.

47:06.391 --> 47:07.959
- [Arthur] Mary
has never recovered

47:07.993 --> 47:10.628
from her husband and child
being taken from her.

47:10.661 --> 47:13.831
Her grasp of the
real world is fading.

47:14.966 --> 47:17.535
Mary has offered many
identities to us.

47:17.568 --> 47:21.239
The most disturbing
of all is the witch.

47:21.272 --> 47:24.976
She believes the witch took
her family away from her.

47:25.010 --> 47:27.745
(low rumbling)

47:27.778 --> 47:31.282
(eerie atmospheric music)

47:33.084 --> 47:34.752
- Mary is the witch.

47:46.331 --> 47:47.933
I'm not going away.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.936
- [Witch] Neither am I.

47:52.203 --> 47:55.340
- I know why you're doing this.

47:55.373 --> 47:58.143
You believe they
took your child,

48:00.211 --> 48:01.446
your husband.

48:01.479 --> 48:02.981
(witch laughing)

48:03.014 --> 48:04.082
You're wrong.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.553
- How little you know.

48:09.887 --> 48:12.557
- Spare me your vengeance, Mary.

48:14.960 --> 48:17.862
I'm sorry you lost your family,

48:17.895 --> 48:20.565
but I won't let you take mine.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.200
(door creaking)

48:22.233 --> 48:23.068
- Mom!

48:24.435 --> 48:25.937
- [Adeline] Chloe.

48:27.472 --> 48:30.241
(witch laughing)

48:34.045 --> 48:36.581
- [Witch] Are you ready
to know the truth yet?

48:36.614 --> 48:37.949
- Open the door.

48:45.323 --> 48:48.726
(air raid horn sounding)

48:51.396 --> 48:54.966
(intense orchestral music)

49:04.275 --> 49:07.278
- [Witch] Aw, you
couldn't save her.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.516
You let her die.

49:15.320 --> 49:18.056
(witch laughing)

49:19.924 --> 49:24.662
Your helpless poor
little child died.

49:26.431 --> 49:30.635
You killed her, Mary, you.

49:30.668 --> 49:34.072
(screaming and laughing)

49:50.855 --> 49:54.359
(eerie atmospheric music)

50:52.883 --> 50:54.552
- How are you, Mary?

50:56.954 --> 51:00.158
Do you remember who
I am, my real name?

51:03.894 --> 51:06.097
- I'm Doctor Miles Litner

51:06.131 --> 51:07.798
and you've been under
my supervision here

51:07.832 --> 51:09.934
for almost two years now.

51:11.236 --> 51:13.204
Although, you've offered
us many identities,

51:13.238 --> 51:17.408
it's encouraging to be
talking to you at last, Mary.

51:20.711 --> 51:21.812
- Where am I?

51:23.281 --> 51:25.616
- [Doctor Litner] This is
a psychiatric institution.

51:25.650 --> 51:27.051
- A lunatic asylum.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.119
- No.

51:28.153 --> 51:29.454
We are here to help people,

51:29.487 --> 51:31.789
not to punish them.

51:31.822 --> 51:34.492
You've done nothing wrong, Mary.

51:36.527 --> 51:38.496
Has it come back to you,

51:38.529 --> 51:41.199
your past, what happened to you?

51:42.367 --> 51:43.201
- Some.

51:45.002 --> 51:48.839
- Would you tell me
exactly what you remember?

51:51.676 --> 51:52.610
Take your time.

51:52.643 --> 51:56.247
(dramatic orchestral music)

51:59.417 --> 52:00.385
- I remember

52:02.253 --> 52:09.860
smoke, screams, the
smell of burning flesh.

52:15.032 --> 52:19.136
My daughter Chloe, lying
beneath the rubble,

52:19.170 --> 52:21.439
(screaming)

52:21.472 --> 52:23.308
life leaving her eyes.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.312
- Two years ago,
your home in Kent

52:27.345 --> 52:28.279
was bombed.

52:29.447 --> 52:31.349
You were pulled to
safety by neighbors,

52:31.382 --> 52:33.884
but Chloe wasn't so fortunate.

52:35.152 --> 52:36.654
She died that day.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.826
- I couldn't save her.

52:42.893 --> 52:44.395
- You ran back into the wreckage

52:44.429 --> 52:47.198
to find her, but
it was too late.

52:48.433 --> 52:50.268
You did all you could.

52:54.071 --> 52:57.842
You did everything that
could have been done.

53:01.111 --> 53:04.282
The war has eroded
so many minds here.

53:05.816 --> 53:07.852
You're not the first to
try to distance yourself

53:07.885 --> 53:11.422
from its casualties,
from the truth.

53:11.456 --> 53:13.758
You couldn't live with yourself.

53:13.791 --> 53:17.528
You created a new world,
a new identity in Adeline,

53:17.562 --> 53:22.467
that allowed you to live
as a strong mother again.

53:22.500 --> 53:25.603
You imagined Chloe by your side.

53:25.636 --> 53:27.071
You imagined protecting her

53:27.104 --> 53:29.974
from the dangers
that killed her.

53:30.007 --> 53:33.010
In your fantasy,
you could save her,

53:34.945 --> 53:37.782
but deep down, you
knew the truth.

53:39.750 --> 53:44.021
And over time it seeped
in through the cracks.

53:44.054 --> 53:48.125
You couldn't stop Chloe
being taken from you.

53:48.158 --> 53:49.894
Your trauma always found a way

53:49.927 --> 53:54.031
to break in in the most
horrific ways imaginable.

53:55.700 --> 53:58.569
We hoped that by aiding
you in search for Chloe

53:58.603 --> 54:01.472
that it would trigger
these discarded memories,

54:01.506 --> 54:04.709
memories that would finally
open your eyes to the truth,

54:04.742 --> 54:05.576
to Mary.

54:11.616 --> 54:17.288
- Reality holds nothing
for me, not anymore.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.692
- You can't bring
her back, Mary.

54:22.993 --> 54:25.496
When you see her, talk to her,

54:26.697 --> 54:29.734
you're not talking
to your daughter.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.869
You're talking to an imitation,

54:31.902 --> 54:33.338
a pale imitation.

54:35.406 --> 54:36.641
She's not real.

54:41.011 --> 54:42.513
Loss hurts us all.

54:43.280 --> 54:47.452
In time, let me show you that
life still has much to offer.

54:47.485 --> 54:51.656
If we're to make any progress,
you need to accept the truth.

54:52.657 --> 54:54.325
You have to let her go.

54:54.359 --> 54:58.028
(dramatic orchestral music)

55:00.898 --> 55:02.467
Can you let her go?

55:11.809 --> 55:12.810
- I need to.

55:19.350 --> 55:20.351
- Thank you.

55:48.679 --> 55:52.349
You once asked me what
was behind this door.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.958
This is the east wing,

56:00.991 --> 56:03.093
home to 40 other
members of our family

56:03.127 --> 56:05.863
here at the Brynhill
Institution.

56:50.941 --> 56:54.344
- [James] We should
be getting back soon.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.187
It's nearly lunch time.

57:09.193 --> 57:10.595
- He's not real.

57:10.628 --> 57:11.796
He's not real.

57:13.097 --> 57:15.633
- [James] Are you all right?

57:15.666 --> 57:16.867
- He's not real.

57:16.901 --> 57:18.168
- [James] I said
are you all right?

57:18.202 --> 57:19.537
- He's not real.

57:22.807 --> 57:26.477
(dramatic orchestral music)

57:42.993 --> 57:43.828
I'm fine.

57:46.731 --> 57:48.566
- Shall we find Chloe.

57:49.433 --> 57:50.501
- She's here?

57:51.368 --> 57:52.369
- Of course.

57:53.270 --> 57:54.104
Come on.

58:33.077 --> 58:35.312
(laughing)

58:36.981 --> 58:39.183
- Let's play again.

58:39.216 --> 58:40.050
But, Mom.

58:55.199 --> 58:57.702
- The delusions have returned.

58:59.036 --> 59:01.005
She can't keep them out.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.506
- There was always a chance.

59:02.539 --> 59:06.543
- She was of clear mind
no more than an hour ago.

59:06.577 --> 59:08.746
- Mary is an extreme case.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.416
- It's impossible to watch.

59:12.449 --> 59:17.254
- Take it from me, there are
no easy cases here at Brynhill.

59:17.287 --> 59:19.356
We all want the best
for our patients,

59:19.389 --> 59:23.060
but unfortunately,
that's not always enough.

59:27.531 --> 59:30.635
- How do we get through to her?

59:30.668 --> 59:33.037
- It may be time to accept--

59:33.070 --> 59:34.238
- Accept what?

59:35.372 --> 59:37.608
- To accept that we can't.

59:37.642 --> 59:39.009
- No.

59:39.043 --> 59:41.145
No, there's always a way.

59:42.980 --> 59:45.415
- Read through the files.

59:45.449 --> 59:47.785
30 years of identical cases.

59:48.986 --> 59:52.122
When the patient reaches
complete self-awareness,

59:52.156 --> 59:56.093
catharsis, and descends
this far this quickly,

59:56.126 --> 59:57.895
they never come back.

1:00:01.198 --> 1:00:04.835
You have a good
heart, Doctor Powell.

1:00:04.869 --> 1:00:07.638
Don't let it cloud
your judgment.

1:00:14.011 --> 1:00:16.346
- What will you do with her?

1:00:21.118 --> 1:00:22.286
No.

1:00:22.319 --> 1:00:24.121
No, there must be another way.

1:00:24.154 --> 1:00:25.089
- Name one.

1:00:27.057 --> 1:00:30.127
There's little else
we can do for her.

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:32.262
I'm sending her to ward C.

1:00:32.296 --> 1:00:34.231
- A lobotomy is not the answer.

1:00:34.264 --> 1:00:36.300
- I have witnessed more
of these procedures

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:38.836
than I care to remember.

1:00:38.869 --> 1:00:42.372
I truly thought we had got
through to her this time.

1:00:42.406 --> 1:00:44.875
We provided her with
the opportunity to
discover the truth

1:00:44.909 --> 1:00:48.578
on her own and it only
brought more pain.

1:00:48.612 --> 1:00:50.715
- But, Mary has
this inner strength.

1:00:50.748 --> 1:00:53.483
She has this inner voice
that's fighting to keep her

1:00:53.517 --> 1:00:54.985
in the real world.

1:00:55.019 --> 1:00:56.821
I'm just asking you to
give her one more chance,

1:00:56.854 --> 1:00:58.756
one opportunity, so she
can accept the truth

1:00:58.789 --> 1:01:00.090
once and for all.

1:01:00.124 --> 1:01:02.659
- Delusions of the
witch will return.

1:01:02.693 --> 1:01:04.261
It's always the same routine.

1:01:04.294 --> 1:01:07.031
It's just a matter of time.

1:01:07.064 --> 1:01:09.399
- I know you've seen it too.

1:01:10.534 --> 1:01:12.369
- Why must she
suffer any longer?

1:01:12.402 --> 1:01:14.739
She needs us to help her.

1:01:14.772 --> 1:01:17.908
- 'Cause we are almost there.

1:01:17.942 --> 1:01:22.012
She will put her visions
and her past behind her.

1:01:26.516 --> 1:01:27.985
- She has one more night,

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:29.353
one last chance.

1:01:30.287 --> 1:01:32.757
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:01:32.790 --> 1:01:34.892
- That's not enough time.

1:01:36.226 --> 1:01:40.230
- This ends tomorrow
morning, one way or another.

1:01:55.145 --> 1:01:56.413
- What's wrong?

1:02:04.188 --> 1:02:06.190
- Look after her, James.

1:02:15.399 --> 1:02:17.401
Be good for your father.

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:23.073
I'll see you soon.

1:02:39.556 --> 1:02:40.891
- Goodbye, Mary.

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.537
- [Chloe] Goodnight, Mommy.

1:03:26.403 --> 1:03:28.805
- Why are the main lights on?

1:03:35.012 --> 1:03:37.681
- I couldn't leave, not tonight.

1:03:38.916 --> 1:03:39.816
How is she?

1:03:41.251 --> 1:03:42.719
- I followed her every footstep.

1:03:42.752 --> 1:03:44.254
I noted her every word.

1:03:44.288 --> 1:03:45.622
- [Doctor Powell] And?

1:03:45.655 --> 1:03:46.957
- I see no progress.

1:03:46.991 --> 1:03:47.992
- [Doctor Powell] Is
she showing signs--

1:03:48.025 --> 1:03:50.194
- No significant progress.

1:03:52.629 --> 1:03:54.999
- But Mary's on the road
to recovery, therefore--

1:03:55.032 --> 1:03:56.533
- It's not enough.

1:03:57.534 --> 1:03:58.368
It's over.

1:04:00.204 --> 1:04:02.339
Tomorrow morning
she goes to ward C.

1:04:02.372 --> 1:04:06.043
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:13.283
Goodnight, Doctor Powell.

1:04:18.788 --> 1:04:23.127
- You can't hide the
truth, not anymore.

1:04:26.396 --> 1:04:28.298
I followed your advice.

1:04:29.766 --> 1:04:31.969
I looked through the archives.

1:04:32.002 --> 1:04:33.904
- Then you saw the theme,

1:04:33.938 --> 1:04:36.040
the promise of
progress in a patient

1:04:36.073 --> 1:04:38.075
and then disappointment.

1:04:40.210 --> 1:04:45.382
- I saw reports of progress
in the eyes of other doctors.

1:04:48.585 --> 1:04:52.356
All disputed and eventually
overruled by you.

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:55.859
- I warned you of the
danger of letting your heart

1:04:55.892 --> 1:04:57.161
rule your head.

1:04:58.628 --> 1:05:01.398
- You resigned
them all to ward C,

1:05:03.300 --> 1:05:04.701
to a lobotomy.

1:05:04.734 --> 1:05:06.003
- We're here to help them,

1:05:06.036 --> 1:05:08.072
to make the difficult
decisions, to stop--

1:05:08.105 --> 1:05:10.040
- To stop them talking.

1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:18.415
Tell me about Frank Harris.

1:05:20.384 --> 1:05:23.153
- Forgive me, my
memory fails me.

1:05:25.589 --> 1:05:27.591
- How about James Isaac?

1:05:28.825 --> 1:05:29.926
Janet Parker?

1:05:34.564 --> 1:05:38.635
Why did you hide their files?

1:05:45.309 --> 1:05:48.312
What, still no
recollection, doctor?

1:05:50.647 --> 1:05:52.316
Refresh your memory,

1:05:53.917 --> 1:05:56.020
because it's all in here,

1:05:58.022 --> 1:05:59.256
just like Mary.

1:06:00.424 --> 1:06:02.359
All three were
once patients here,

1:06:02.392 --> 1:06:04.828
paranoid schizophrenics.

1:06:04.861 --> 1:06:06.430
Three wildly
different characters,

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:07.731
three different issues,

1:06:07.764 --> 1:06:09.966
but they shared one belief,

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.901
a belief denied by you.

1:06:13.437 --> 1:06:15.805
A belief that you
still deny today,

1:06:15.839 --> 1:06:17.241
even to yourself.

1:06:18.608 --> 1:06:22.979
Through her haunted
doll, the witch lives on.

1:06:23.013 --> 1:06:24.414
- Search too hard for logic

1:06:24.448 --> 1:06:26.316
in the beliefs of a
paranoid schizophrenic

1:06:26.350 --> 1:06:28.152
and you end up
believing them yourself.

1:06:28.185 --> 1:06:30.554
- The witch is tormenting
the weak-minded patients

1:06:30.587 --> 1:06:32.322
under your care

1:06:32.356 --> 1:06:35.592
and you silenced those
brave enough to describe

1:06:35.625 --> 1:06:36.793
what they see.

1:06:38.128 --> 1:06:40.097
You label them delusional
and if you believe

1:06:40.130 --> 1:06:41.765
that you could get
away with this,

1:06:41.798 --> 1:06:44.734
you are more delusional
than any of them.

1:06:44.768 --> 1:06:47.037
Now why are you
hiding the truth?

1:06:47.071 --> 1:06:50.674
- I won't let a fucking lie
destroy what I have here,

1:06:50.707 --> 1:06:52.176
what I have built.

1:06:52.209 --> 1:06:53.910
- [Doctor Powell] You
won't silence Mary

1:06:53.943 --> 1:06:55.645
and you will not silence me.

1:06:55.679 --> 1:06:56.546
Do you hear me?

1:06:56.580 --> 1:06:59.249
(knife slicing)

1:07:01.851 --> 1:07:04.688
(heavy breathing)

1:07:12.229 --> 1:07:16.400
(ominous orchestral
music rising)

1:07:32.382 --> 1:07:35.119
(shovel digging)

1:08:04.681 --> 1:08:07.917
(knocking and banging)

1:08:12.956 --> 1:08:16.460
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:08:38.748 --> 1:08:42.252
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:09:47.484 --> 1:09:50.220
(door knocking)

1:09:50.254 --> 1:09:51.755
- [DC Jones] Doctor Litner?

1:09:51.788 --> 1:09:52.956
- [Doctor Litner] Yes?

1:09:52.989 --> 1:09:54.991
- DC Jones, Harrington police.

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:56.192
May I have a word?

1:09:56.226 --> 1:09:57.561
- Yes, of course.

1:09:57.594 --> 1:09:59.229
Sit down.

1:09:59.263 --> 1:10:00.430
Can I get you a drink?

1:10:00.464 --> 1:10:01.831
- [DC Jones] Um, no, thank you.

1:10:01.865 --> 1:10:02.832
- [Doctor Litner]
It's no trouble.

1:10:02.866 --> 1:10:04.268
- [DC Jones] I'm on duty.

1:10:04.301 --> 1:10:06.770
- Oh, yes, of course.

1:10:06.803 --> 1:10:09.539
- This isn't a
social visit, doctor.

1:10:09.573 --> 1:10:11.074
- [Doctor Litner] Clearly.

1:10:11.107 --> 1:10:13.843
- I've been assigned to
a missing person's case.

1:10:13.877 --> 1:10:16.846
The person we're searching
for is your colleague,

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.715
Doctor Charles Powell.

1:10:19.949 --> 1:10:20.984
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1:10:21.017 --> 1:10:24.053
Tell me, when was the last
time you saw Mr. Powell?

1:10:24.087 --> 1:10:26.222
- Um, last Friday.

1:10:26.256 --> 1:10:28.057
We were assisting a patient,

1:10:28.091 --> 1:10:30.260
a particularly
challenging patient.

1:10:30.294 --> 1:10:31.595
- Ah, yes.

1:10:31.628 --> 1:10:34.063
Mrs. Mary Thomas.

1:10:36.032 --> 1:10:37.934
- Yes, that's correct.

1:10:37.967 --> 1:10:40.036
- Yes, I'd like for you
to arrange a meeting

1:10:40.069 --> 1:10:42.105
for me and Ms.
Thomas if possible.

1:10:42.138 --> 1:10:45.809
- I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

1:10:45.842 --> 1:10:47.844
- I can organize a
warrant if need be.

1:10:47.877 --> 1:10:50.414
- You misunderstand
me, constable.

1:10:50.447 --> 1:10:52.181
Following her
treatment, Mary Thomas

1:10:52.215 --> 1:10:55.218
is not capable of
talking to anyone.

1:10:58.655 --> 1:10:59.489
- Mm.

1:11:00.824 --> 1:11:03.427
- Doctor Powell is
relatively new here,

1:11:03.460 --> 1:11:05.061
learning the ropes.

1:11:05.094 --> 1:11:08.231
He gets emotionally
attached to the patients.

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:10.767
He can almost feel their pain.

1:11:12.035 --> 1:11:14.103
I suggested he left
early that day,

1:11:14.137 --> 1:11:17.040
took some time away
from the asylum,

1:11:17.073 --> 1:11:18.575
to clear his head.

1:11:19.443 --> 1:11:20.910
I believe it was about--

1:11:20.944 --> 1:11:24.381
- Let's stick to facts,
shall we, doctor?

1:11:26.082 --> 1:11:29.386
- I sent him home
at four o'clock.

1:11:29.419 --> 1:11:33.189
- Well, that completely
contradicts what his wife says.

1:11:33.222 --> 1:11:36.460
- Mrs. Powell said that he
was here working all night.

1:11:36.493 --> 1:11:37.627
- Impossible.

1:11:37.661 --> 1:11:39.162
- And you're sure?

1:11:40.029 --> 1:11:41.665
- I remember it vividly.

1:11:41.698 --> 1:11:42.866
I wished him well.

1:11:42.899 --> 1:11:45.369
He thanked me for
allowing him time away

1:11:45.402 --> 1:11:48.838
and he walked out of
site, off the grounds.

1:11:48.872 --> 1:11:50.707
- What was he wearing?

1:11:53.477 --> 1:11:54.878
- I don't recall.

1:11:56.079 --> 1:11:59.282
- And yet you say you
remember it vividly.

1:12:00.283 --> 1:12:02.251
- He wore a hat, a coat.

1:12:03.387 --> 1:12:05.755
- What was the
color of this coat?

1:12:05.789 --> 1:12:06.823
- Is that important?

1:12:06.856 --> 1:12:08.692
- Answer the question.

1:12:12.261 --> 1:12:13.697
- Gray.

1:12:13.730 --> 1:12:17.934
- A statement that matches
that of Mrs. Powell's at last.

1:12:17.967 --> 1:12:20.404
- He always wore a gray coat.

1:12:21.971 --> 1:12:22.806
- Perhaps...

1:12:26.476 --> 1:12:27.310
...this.

1:12:32.482 --> 1:12:36.085
An odd thing to forget
whilst walking home

1:12:36.119 --> 1:12:40.123
on a dismal day in December,
wouldn't you agree?

1:12:41.558 --> 1:12:45.729
I spotted this gray coat
buried on the staff coat rack.

1:12:47.130 --> 1:12:51.835
It matched the coat description
his wife described exactly.

1:12:51.868 --> 1:12:54.037
The last time she saw him.

1:12:55.171 --> 1:12:57.707
- We all own a gray coat.

1:12:57.741 --> 1:13:00.577
What attributes this
particular coat to him?

1:13:00.610 --> 1:13:02.479
- A prescription
in the left pocket

1:13:02.512 --> 1:13:03.947
to Mr. C. Powell.

1:13:05.782 --> 1:13:08.652
- Maybe he left it behind.

1:13:08.685 --> 1:13:12.188
- Some may suggest he
didn't leave at all.

1:13:12.221 --> 1:13:14.791
- And what does
it suggest to you?

1:13:14.824 --> 1:13:18.495
- I'm merely here
to ask questions.

1:13:18.528 --> 1:13:21.498
Mrs. Powell received a
telephone call that evening.

1:13:21.531 --> 1:13:22.866
It was from her husband.

1:13:22.899 --> 1:13:25.168
He said how he
needed to work late

1:13:25.201 --> 1:13:27.136
and that he had to have
a conversation with you.

1:13:27.170 --> 1:13:28.472
He seemed agitated.

1:13:28.505 --> 1:13:31.274
What could that conversation
have been about?

1:13:31.307 --> 1:13:33.943
- Something tells me you
think you already know.

1:13:33.977 --> 1:13:36.079
- Did you have
that conversation?

1:13:36.112 --> 1:13:37.981
Did you have some
sort of confrontation?

1:13:38.014 --> 1:13:39.449
- No.

1:13:39.483 --> 1:13:41.918
- Mrs. Powell described her
husband's demeanor as agitated,

1:13:41.951 --> 1:13:42.786
frustrated

1:13:44.287 --> 1:13:47.691
at the way you deal with
mentally fragile patients.

1:13:47.724 --> 1:13:50.627
- My patients are like family
to me, they are family.

1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:53.029
I treat them like my own.

1:13:53.062 --> 1:13:57.233
- Did Mr. Powell ever witness
you mistreating a patient?

1:13:58.134 --> 1:13:58.968
- No.

1:14:08.778 --> 1:14:12.148
You really should try
this whiskey, constable.

1:14:12.181 --> 1:14:15.051
It's Jim Watkins' favorite.

1:14:15.084 --> 1:14:18.755
Yes, Sir James Watkins,
the chief constable.

1:14:20.490 --> 1:14:21.858
- You know him well?

1:14:21.891 --> 1:14:24.327
- We share a love of golf.

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:28.364
He has a good swing, but
he's a terrible putter.

1:14:29.966 --> 1:14:33.102
You should be careful what
allegations you make against me,

1:14:33.136 --> 1:14:33.970
constable.

1:14:35.404 --> 1:14:39.509
You may find this becomes a
career-changing case for you.

1:14:41.077 --> 1:14:45.414
- You sound like a man
that has something to hide.

1:14:45.448 --> 1:14:47.884
- No, I'm afraid
it is Doctor Powell

1:14:47.917 --> 1:14:50.086
who has something to hide.

1:14:51.420 --> 1:14:54.591
If you were half the
detective you think you are,

1:14:54.624 --> 1:14:58.294
you would've searched
both his coat pockets.

1:15:12.876 --> 1:15:15.879
He would take the
wedding ring off.

1:15:15.912 --> 1:15:18.247
It was a ritual, a routine.

1:15:18.281 --> 1:15:20.083
All he told me was

1:15:20.116 --> 1:15:22.986
that when he put the wedding
ring back on in the morning,

1:15:23.019 --> 1:15:26.590
in his mind, nothing
had happened.

1:15:26.623 --> 1:15:27.724
- A mistress?

1:15:28.925 --> 1:15:32.195
- Miss Powell is not the
only woman in his life.

1:15:32.228 --> 1:15:34.197
In the minds of
those around him,

1:15:34.230 --> 1:15:37.701
he made sure he was
here on Friday night.

1:15:37.734 --> 1:15:41.404
In fact he would've
been with another woman.

1:15:42.572 --> 1:15:45.141
- [DC Jones] I need a name.

1:15:45.174 --> 1:15:47.644
- [Doctor Litner]
Miss Beverly Shaw.

1:15:47.677 --> 1:15:50.179
- Where can I find Miss Shaw?

1:15:50.213 --> 1:15:52.115
- Well, until Friday night,

1:15:52.148 --> 1:15:56.319
you would've found her on
Church Street, number 59.

1:15:57.887 --> 1:15:59.589
Along with Miss Shaw,
I fear Doctor Powell

1:15:59.623 --> 1:16:02.225
is another casualty of
Friday night's bombing raid

1:16:02.258 --> 1:16:04.560
on Harrington town.

1:16:04.594 --> 1:16:05.862
Such a tragedy.

1:16:07.997 --> 1:16:10.634
I'm afraid Doctor Powell
may remain a missing person

1:16:10.667 --> 1:16:11.768
indefinitely.

1:16:15.204 --> 1:16:18.474
I trust you can
see yourself out.

1:16:18.507 --> 1:16:20.710
Give my regards to the chief
constable when you see him,

1:16:20.744 --> 1:16:21.577
won't you?

1:16:22.912 --> 1:16:26.415
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:16:56.145 --> 1:16:58.047
- [Doris] Doctor Nolan!

1:16:58.915 --> 1:16:59.983
Doctor Nolan!

1:17:04.187 --> 1:17:05.021
- Doris?

1:17:06.189 --> 1:17:08.291
(crying)

1:17:17.633 --> 1:17:18.467
Doris.

1:17:23.306 --> 1:17:25.241
Doris, can you hear me?

1:17:27.110 --> 1:17:30.680
- Yes, I hear you.

1:17:30.714 --> 1:17:32.682
- [Doctor Litner]
Are you all right?

1:17:32.716 --> 1:17:33.549
- No.

1:17:35.584 --> 1:17:37.586
- Why are you down here?

1:17:41.090 --> 1:17:42.525
- I heard a voice

1:17:45.061 --> 1:17:46.996
and I followed it.

1:17:47.030 --> 1:17:50.199
- [Doctor Litner] But
I locked the door.

1:17:50.233 --> 1:17:52.235
- It didn't stay locked.

1:17:55.772 --> 1:17:58.574
- Please, please don't
send me back up there,

1:17:58.607 --> 1:17:59.575
please please.

1:17:59.608 --> 1:18:00.409
- [Doctor Litner] Why?

1:18:00.443 --> 1:18:01.878
- Because I'm afraid.

1:18:01.911 --> 1:18:03.479
- You're safe here.

1:18:06.716 --> 1:18:08.384
Stay with me, Doris.

1:18:10.353 --> 1:18:13.422
I need you to be
brave, to be honest.

1:18:15.091 --> 1:18:17.026
Can you do that for me?

1:18:18.527 --> 1:18:19.362
- Yeah.

1:18:21.197 --> 1:18:25.368
- I want you to tell me what
happened to you tonight.

1:18:27.470 --> 1:18:28.304
- I,

1:18:30.273 --> 1:18:33.910
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:18:33.943 --> 1:18:36.946
I lay in bed

1:18:40.784 --> 1:18:42.952
and I couldn't sleep

1:18:42.986 --> 1:18:43.820
and

1:18:45.421 --> 1:18:46.255
I,

1:18:47.757 --> 1:18:50.226
thought's kept just going

1:18:50.259 --> 1:18:53.930
round and round in my
head, like cockroaches

1:18:53.963 --> 1:18:56.299
and I heard the door unlock.

1:19:02.471 --> 1:19:03.807
It slowly opened

1:19:05.975 --> 1:19:08.044
and I thought it was you,

1:19:14.183 --> 1:19:15.852
'cause it had to be,

1:19:18.621 --> 1:19:21.791
but it wasn't.

1:19:25.128 --> 1:19:25.962
It was

1:19:28.297 --> 1:19:29.132
someone,

1:19:31.534 --> 1:19:32.768
something else.

1:19:35.704 --> 1:19:37.273
- What did you see?

1:19:42.778 --> 1:19:43.612
- Nothing.

1:19:44.547 --> 1:19:47.383
Just an empty corridor

1:19:49.052 --> 1:19:56.792
and then I heard this
sound of a child crying

1:19:59.295 --> 1:20:00.897
on the stairs

1:20:00.930 --> 1:20:02.765
and I,

1:20:04.167 --> 1:20:05.501
how could I just

1:20:08.004 --> 1:20:08.838
lie there?

1:20:09.839 --> 1:20:10.773
I couldn't.

1:20:15.011 --> 1:20:18.547
I wanted to, to help
her, to comfort her.

1:20:18.581 --> 1:20:21.918
- Doris, are you
taking your medication?

1:20:24.854 --> 1:20:26.689
- But it was no child.

1:20:28.557 --> 1:20:30.559
It was no child, doctor.

1:20:31.727 --> 1:20:33.696
It was something else.

1:20:33.729 --> 1:20:36.065
- Are you taking your meds?

1:20:36.099 --> 1:20:38.334
- It was a doll, Doctor Litner.

1:20:38.367 --> 1:20:40.003
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:20:40.036 --> 1:20:41.204
It was a doll.

1:20:47.710 --> 1:20:49.045
Not only a doll.

1:20:51.814 --> 1:20:54.383
There was life behind its eyes.

1:20:57.586 --> 1:20:59.355
It was a living doll.

1:21:03.192 --> 1:21:04.961
It was a living doll.

1:21:10.533 --> 1:21:13.002
You've seen it
before, haven't you?

1:21:13.036 --> 1:21:17.040
- You've suffered a
hallucination, nothing more.

1:21:18.207 --> 1:21:20.409
We've been down
this road before.

1:21:20.443 --> 1:21:23.812
For weeks, you were giving
me a story about a man

1:21:23.846 --> 1:21:25.714
looking through your window.

1:21:25.748 --> 1:21:27.951
You told me he was
trying to kill you.

1:21:27.984 --> 1:21:29.252
You were wrong.

1:21:30.786 --> 1:21:33.822
In time you came to
accept and understand

1:21:33.856 --> 1:21:35.791
that you were mistaken.

1:21:38.261 --> 1:21:39.595
- Not this time.

1:21:43.532 --> 1:21:46.936
We share this asylum
with a spirit, doctor,

1:21:46.970 --> 1:21:49.372
a hateful spirit.

1:21:50.573 --> 1:21:53.409
None of us are
safe, not even you.

1:21:56.879 --> 1:21:58.881
You know that I'm right.

1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:06.522
Even now I can hear her.

1:22:08.024 --> 1:22:09.792
She's talking.

1:22:09.825 --> 1:22:12.161
- What is she saying to you?

1:22:17.900 --> 1:22:20.103
- She's saying

1:22:21.904 --> 1:22:23.506
threatening words.

1:22:23.539 --> 1:22:24.373
- Tell me.

1:22:25.308 --> 1:22:26.509
- [Doris] I can't.

1:22:26.542 --> 1:22:27.376
- Tell me.

1:22:35.218 --> 1:22:39.388
- She saying the same four
words over and over again.

1:22:42.825 --> 1:22:44.493
You're going to die.

1:22:45.594 --> 1:22:47.263
You're going to die.

1:22:48.431 --> 1:22:50.099
You're going to die.

1:23:03.512 --> 1:23:06.849
But she's not saying
them to me, doctor.

1:23:09.718 --> 1:23:11.454
She's talking to you.

1:23:18.694 --> 1:23:20.929
(laughing)

1:23:25.634 --> 1:23:28.371
(child laughing)

1:23:45.754 --> 1:23:47.156
- It's not alive.

1:23:49.258 --> 1:23:50.359
It can't be true.

1:23:50.393 --> 1:23:53.129
(pills rattling)

1:23:56.465 --> 1:24:00.336
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1:25:04.567 --> 1:25:05.968
It can't be true.

1:25:13.509 --> 1:25:15.578
(head creaking)

1:25:15.611 --> 1:25:18.381
(whispering)

1:25:18.414 --> 1:25:22.518
(eerie atmospheric music rising)

1:25:33.529 --> 1:25:34.797
- All right, here we are.

1:25:34.830 --> 1:25:36.499
We are here finally,
on the grounds

1:25:36.532 --> 1:25:38.133
of the Brynhill Mental Asylum.

1:25:38.167 --> 1:25:40.203
If you've been on
this channel before,

1:25:40.236 --> 1:25:41.904
you know how long I've
waited for this day.

1:25:41.937 --> 1:25:44.373
And if you're new around here,
hit that subscribe button.

1:25:44.407 --> 1:25:47.443
I have brought Emma
along for this one.

1:25:47.476 --> 1:25:49.278
She's dying to
see inside it too,

1:25:49.312 --> 1:25:50.746
as you can tell.

1:25:50.779 --> 1:25:53.616
So, yeah, this asylum has
just been closed down.

1:25:53.649 --> 1:25:55.751
It's safe to say that it has
housed many people who were

1:25:55.784 --> 1:26:00.489
mentally disturbed and
yeah, many people are said

1:26:00.523 --> 1:26:02.258
to have died here.

1:26:02.291 --> 1:26:04.693
For decades, staff and
patients have gone on record

1:26:04.727 --> 1:26:07.230
claiming to have witnessed
paranormal activity here,

1:26:07.263 --> 1:26:09.265
so if we can get a
shot of something,

1:26:09.298 --> 1:26:11.634
anything close to
what they wrote about,

1:26:11.667 --> 1:26:13.936
then this is gonna be good.

1:26:15.738 --> 1:26:19.308
(ominous orchestral music)

1:26:28.016 --> 1:26:30.018
- No, you're gonna fall.

1:26:51.206 --> 1:26:54.176
- This place is
over 400 years old.

1:26:54.209 --> 1:26:56.612
Can you imagine
being a patient here?

1:26:56.645 --> 1:26:58.314
It is pretty creepy.

1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:20.336
Oh, that didn't work?

1:27:20.369 --> 1:27:21.370
Shocking.

1:27:24.607 --> 1:27:26.875
Let's try to find a
broken door or window,

1:27:26.909 --> 1:27:28.744
maybe around the back.

1:27:46.829 --> 1:27:47.796
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:27:47.830 --> 1:27:48.997
Emma?

1:27:52.601 --> 1:27:54.169
Emma, what's wrong?

1:28:30.973 --> 1:28:32.408
- [Emma] I can't.

1:28:33.809 --> 1:28:34.643
- Why?

1:28:38.581 --> 1:28:40.516
- I just, I can't, Sam.

1:28:41.717 --> 1:28:43.552
I can't do this.

1:28:43.586 --> 1:28:45.320
- It's just an empty building.

1:28:45.354 --> 1:28:48.791
We'll be in there for 20
minutes tops, I promise.

1:28:48.824 --> 1:28:51.326
What are you afraid of?

1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:54.963
(ominous orchestral music)

1:28:56.098 --> 1:28:57.265
- When I looked
through the window,

1:28:57.299 --> 1:28:59.034
I saw something move,

1:29:00.268 --> 1:29:05.007
like a shadow or
something, okay?

1:29:05.541 --> 1:29:06.775
- Are you sure?

1:29:10.145 --> 1:29:12.214
- No, but you know
what they saw.

1:29:12.247 --> 1:29:13.449
- What, do you believe them?

1:29:13.482 --> 1:29:14.316
Truly?

1:29:15.183 --> 1:29:16.419
- No.

1:29:16.452 --> 1:29:17.386
- [Sam] Then what
are you afraid of?

1:29:17.420 --> 1:29:19.154
- That they're right.

1:29:24.727 --> 1:29:26.328
- Can you be brave?

1:29:27.496 --> 1:29:28.797
- [Emma] Just take
me home, please.

1:29:28.831 --> 1:29:30.065
- We're gonna set
up the cameras,

1:29:30.098 --> 1:29:31.066
we'll have a little look around,

1:29:31.099 --> 1:29:33.101
and then we'll go home.

1:29:33.135 --> 1:29:36.304
10 minutes, that's
all I'm asking for.

1:29:37.406 --> 1:29:40.342
Can you do that for me?

1:29:49.284 --> 1:29:50.519
- Okay.

1:29:50.553 --> 1:29:52.020
- [Sam] It's such a buzz.

1:29:52.054 --> 1:29:53.856
You might even enjoy it.

1:29:53.889 --> 1:29:55.357
(sighing)

1:29:55.390 --> 1:29:56.725
You coming?

1:30:39.768 --> 1:30:42.170
(camera beeping)

1:30:42.204 --> 1:30:44.372
- Okay, Sam, we're set up.

1:30:47.442 --> 1:30:48.711
Sam?

1:30:51.046 --> 1:30:51.880
Sam?

1:31:24.647 --> 1:31:26.815
(gasping)

1:31:28.016 --> 1:31:31.854
Sam, are you trying to
give me a heart attack?

1:31:47.435 --> 1:31:50.038
(box creaking)

1:32:05.688 --> 1:32:07.022
- What was that?

1:32:11.193 --> 1:32:12.094
It's just--

1:32:12.127 --> 1:32:13.528
(box slamming)

1:32:13.562 --> 1:32:14.429
- I told you.

1:32:14.462 --> 1:32:15.530
I fucking told you.

1:32:15.564 --> 1:32:16.832
- It's nothing.

1:32:20.068 --> 1:32:21.737
It's nothing.

1:32:21.770 --> 1:32:24.506
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:32:24.539 --> 1:32:27.109
- No, don't go back down there.

1:33:29.838 --> 1:33:33.075
- I told you,
there's no one here.

1:33:33.108 --> 1:33:34.109
Now come in.

1:33:38.546 --> 1:33:41.383
It's just us and
some creepy doll.

1:33:43.719 --> 1:33:45.754
- [Emma] What doll?

1:33:45.788 --> 1:33:48.056
- In the chest, there
was a doll, I swear.

1:33:48.090 --> 1:33:48.924
- Funny.

1:33:52.227 --> 1:33:55.731
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:33:58.233 --> 1:33:59.534
We need to go.

1:33:59.567 --> 1:34:00.368
- No, not yet.

1:34:00.402 --> 1:34:01.036
- No, we need to leave.

1:34:01.069 --> 1:34:02.437
- No.

1:34:02.470 --> 1:34:05.207
(child laughing)

1:34:09.177 --> 1:34:13.248
(eerie atmospheric music rising)

1:34:21.056 --> 1:34:23.258
- Sam, I'm begging you, please.

1:34:23.291 --> 1:34:24.192
- All right, go.

1:34:24.226 --> 1:34:25.193
- No, I'm not going without you.

1:34:25.227 --> 1:34:26.061
- Go!

1:34:34.236 --> 1:34:37.740
(eerie atmospheric music)

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:02.397
(eerie atmospheric music rising)

1:35:05.367 --> 1:35:08.937
(dreamy atmospheric music)

1:35:15.410 --> 1:35:17.412
(eerie atmospheric music rising)

1:35:17.445 --> 1:35:19.815
(Sam screaming)

1:35:19.848 --> 1:35:20.916
- [Emma] Sam.

1:35:24.719 --> 1:35:26.889
(gasping)

1:35:32.961 --> 1:35:33.796
Sam, Sam.

1:35:34.729 --> 1:35:36.799
(crying)

1:35:47.976 --> 1:35:50.645
(head creaking)

1:36:06.929 --> 1:36:10.598
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:37:38.753 --> 1:37:42.424
(ominous orchestral music)
