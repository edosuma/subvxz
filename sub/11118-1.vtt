It is because man is choosing

But why?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.559
Because logic is so...

16:39.123 --> 16:40.374
hardly suitable.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.460
I can inspire
Neptune himself to join,

16:43.669 --> 16:46.838
and great whales
and serpents of the sea!

16:47.131 --> 16:50.342
Unfortunately, the quest
will be waged on land.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.510
It's no good, brothers.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.597
It seems I and I alone
can inspire such a mission.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.599
Whom will you send?

16:57.850 --> 17:02.187
Well, first, my old friend,
sir orren Neville-Smythe,

17:02.396 --> 17:03.605
a gallant knight and true.

17:03.814 --> 17:04.564
And?

17:04.773 --> 17:06.400
My dragon gorbash.

17:06.776 --> 17:10.320
He's young and impetuous,
but incredibly strong and brave.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.032
And? There must be three
to begin a magic quest.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.867
The laws so command.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.328
There will be another --
a leader.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.207
- Vvho?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.457
How, then?

17:22.666 --> 17:25.377
Tonight, after you both
have returned to your realms,

17:25.586 --> 17:27.921
I will turn to antiquity
for the choice.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.382
Its wisdom shall prevail.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.844
Well, whoever
antiquity chooses,

17:34.053 --> 17:36.889
your leader will have
his job cut out for him.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.643
I leave him this --
the shield of saturn.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.854
Forged from the mystic dust
of her rings,

17:44.063 --> 17:47.024
it will deflect
<i>any</i> dark magic spell.

17:47.275 --> 17:51.028
I have only implements of peace,
but perhaps he will find

17:51.237 --> 17:53.197
the flute
of healing sleep useful.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.074
It is from
the temple of the muses.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.868
When played, it will lull

17:58.077 --> 18:00.537
the most fearsome dragon
to sleep.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.247
Thank you, good brothers.

18:02.456 --> 18:06.956
Ommadon will not prevail,
and his crown shall be captured.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.296
So be it!

18:09.505 --> 18:12.049
May victory be ours!

18:17.805 --> 18:19.515
Hey, a war at last!

18:19.724 --> 18:21.600
Finally, I will see battle!

18:21.809 --> 18:24.144
Not a war, a <i>quest.</i>

18:24.353 --> 18:27.147
Well, whatever you call it,
I'm ready for it!

18:27.356 --> 18:30.025
Unfortunately,
so is ommadon.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.670
Carolinus:
Hear me now, antiquity!

18:51.297 --> 18:55.797
Hear me, great conglomeration
of spirits gone before!

18:56.469 --> 18:58.137
Make your will known!

18:58.888 --> 19:02.808
Who shall lead the quest
to capture the crown of ommadon?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.564
<i>Search the future.</i>

19:10.149 --> 19:13.902
<i>He will be the distant
descendant of great Peter,</i>

19:14.195 --> 19:15.779
<i>the dragon master.</i>

19:16.322 --> 19:19.450
Oh, I have heard
legends of great Peter.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.868
Centuries ago,
he tamed the dragons

19:22.078 --> 19:23.454
and taught them to speak.

19:23.663 --> 19:28.163
<i>777 generations
separate great Peter</i>

19:28.918 --> 19:31.003
<i>from he whom you seek.</i>

19:31.212 --> 19:34.381
By why so many generations
away from the original?

19:34.590 --> 19:37.175
<i>He is the first
of the descendants</i>

19:37.510 --> 19:39.678
<i>who is a man of science.</i>

19:40.054 --> 19:41.597
Why should that
be important?

19:42.014 --> 19:45.100
<i>Trust the judgment
of antiquity!</i>

19:45.309 --> 19:47.686
I do! I do -- implicitly.

19:48.062 --> 19:52.562
Tell me, in which century
will I find this champion?

19:53.150 --> 19:57.650
<i>10 hence from this --
our 9,000th.</i>

19:58.114 --> 20:02.159
That would make it the 20th
century by man's calendar.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.661
<i>The closing decades.</i>

20:07.873 --> 20:09.332
A silver acorn?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.544
<i>Drop it into
the limpid pool of time,</i>

20:13.087 --> 20:14.755
<i>and you will find him.</i>

20:15.214 --> 20:18.258
<i>And now, farewell.</i>

20:26.600 --> 20:30.020
Are you certain this is
the limpid pool of time?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.481
My dear young fellow,
i am one of

20:32.690 --> 20:34.108
the four magic brothers.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.485
I should know a limpid pool
of time when I see one.

20:40.990 --> 20:45.285
Man: Dragons and wizards
and dungeons and princesses --

20:45.870 --> 20:47.329
dragons and wizards

20:47.538 --> 20:51.083
and princesses and dungeons
and castles --

20:52.042 --> 20:55.920
Mr. Dickinson,
is this all you think about?

20:56.130 --> 20:57.339
Never mind what <i>I</i> think.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.967
What do you think of this
new "flight of dragons" game?

21:00.176 --> 21:02.761
It's fun.
What can I say?

21:03.137 --> 21:04.721
Just a couple
of thousand dollars,

21:04.930 --> 21:06.014
we can manufacture this,

21:06.223 --> 21:07.974
and we'll all be
livin' like kings!

21:08.184 --> 21:10.811
"Just a couple of thousand,"
he says,

21:11.270 --> 21:12.729
like it was peanuts.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.273
This is an heirloom.
It must be worth something.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.194
Your "heirs"
didn't "loom" so big.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.071
If I give you $50,
I'd be fired.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.031
"Flight of dragons" --

21:23.240 --> 21:25.784
aren't you writing
a book by the same name?

21:26.118 --> 21:28.453
<i>Was.</i> I don't have time
to work on it now --

21:28.662 --> 21:30.330
not with holding down
two jobs,

21:30.539 --> 21:31.957
but if this game sells --

21:32.166 --> 21:34.334
you know something,
Mr. Dickinson?

21:34.543 --> 21:38.630
Nothing personal,
but you're a real dragon nut.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.008
They fascinate me --
always have.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.845
I'm sure they
really existed at one time.

21:45.095 --> 21:48.473
See, I'm trying to dope out
how they breathe fire --

21:48.682 --> 21:50.684
I take back the "nut" part.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.644
<i>You're a dragon fanatic.</i>

21:52.853 --> 21:55.772
Right. I eat,
breathe, and sleep 'em.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.149
I hope to become a member
of england's dragon society,

21:58.359 --> 21:59.985
and I live here in Boston.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.445
Your turn, evil wizard.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.616
Why am I always
the bad guy?! Nine!

22:05.825 --> 22:10.287
Ha-ha! I got you blocked
in the enchanted ice passage --

22:10.496 --> 22:12.456
frozen stiff!

22:12.665 --> 22:15.334
Yeah, but an 11 will give me
dragon fire to melt it.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.586
That's going to be
our leader?!

22:18.087 --> 22:21.507
That's the <i>777th</i> son of --

22:21.715 --> 22:23.758
antiquity must know.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.678
Trust antiquity.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.179
How's he gonna stand up
to ommadon

22:28.389 --> 22:30.057
playing with toy dragons?

22:30.266 --> 22:33.394
Look! Look closely
at those small chessmen

22:33.602 --> 22:34.936
<i>he's playing with!</i>

22:35.563 --> 22:38.941
<i>The piece the pawnbroker
is playing with is ommadon!</i>

22:39.859 --> 22:42.528
<i>And there's me
and my brothers!</i>

22:43.404 --> 22:45.239
<i>Dickinson's piece is you!</i>

22:46.115 --> 22:48.992
<i>And in the background,
Princess melisande!</i>

22:49.910 --> 22:52.162
<i>Extraordinary!</i>

22:53.163 --> 22:57.083
<i>Somehow, Dickinson
knows what we look like!</i>

22:57.293 --> 22:58.419
<i>Somehow --</i>

23:00.254 --> 23:02.047
good old antiquity!

23:02.381 --> 23:04.716
I knew I could trust it!

23:05.384 --> 23:08.970
Gorbash, fly to
silvenair and wait for me.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.557
Tell melisande to summon
sir orren Neville-Smythe.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.058
Where are you going?

23:21.817 --> 23:24.820
Bring me to him!
I insist!

23:28.866 --> 23:30.450
What the heck happened?

23:31.619 --> 23:34.496
Hey, are you deaf
or something?

23:34.705 --> 23:36.373
Carolinus:
A splendid game!

23:36.874 --> 23:38.417
Come down and join it!

23:39.126 --> 23:39.835
What?!

23:40.586 --> 23:44.089
<i>Untranto kala!</i>

23:45.591 --> 23:47.843
12! Ha ha ha!

23:48.052 --> 23:49.595
There's no beating that!

23:49.803 --> 23:52.222
Come down, I say!
<i>Kala!</i>

23:53.057 --> 23:54.308
[Vibrating 1

23:58.270 --> 23:59.062
what happened?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.273
I'll explain
during the journey.

24:01.523 --> 24:02.565
Journey?

24:02.775 --> 24:07.275
<i>Sit</i> down!
<i>Szvisumaad kala!</i>

24:20.084 --> 24:22.836
Keep your wits.
We're almost there.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.755
That's what you
said before!

24:24.964 --> 24:26.048
Since those dice
burned out,

24:26.256 --> 24:28.466
it seems like we've
been falling for hours!

24:28.676 --> 24:32.137
Actually, it's been
more like 10 centuries!

24:34.807 --> 24:37.935
Welcome home, carolinus!

24:38.143 --> 24:40.019
Good old smrgol!

24:40.813 --> 24:42.397
A dragon!

24:42.731 --> 24:46.484
I'm actually seeing
a dragon -- a real dragon!

24:46.694 --> 24:48.654
Call me smrgol!

24:48.862 --> 24:52.532
Son of a gun -- a dragon!
I'm talking to a dragon!

24:52.741 --> 24:54.367
I'll get you down!

25:08.424 --> 25:09.716
A dragon!

25:09.925 --> 25:12.010
I'm riding
a blooming dragon!

25:12.219 --> 25:14.054
What'd you call me?!

25:14.263 --> 25:16.640
Ow! Turn your head.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.017
Whoops! I'm sorry.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.728
I've just been singed
by dragon fire!

25:21.937 --> 25:23.688
What a great way to travel!

25:32.156 --> 25:35.868
Well, if you
don't need me any longer,

25:36.785 --> 25:39.746
I hear the call
of my comrades --

25:40.748 --> 25:43.250
a mating dance, perhaps.

25:43.751 --> 25:46.378
Really, smrgol, at your age!

25:53.010 --> 25:57.347
You wanted dragons, my son.
Dragons you shall have.

25:57.598 --> 25:58.932
I'll never understand.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.017
All those toy chessmen
i carved --

26:01.226 --> 26:03.144
those dragons
and wizards --

26:03.353 --> 26:05.438
how did I know
what you look like?

26:05.647 --> 26:08.900
Why question?
Just trust antiquity.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.736
Am I dreaming all this?

26:11.945 --> 26:14.530
Am I on the game board
or in reality?

26:14.740 --> 26:18.493
Perhaps
somewhere in between.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.955
Imagination is the most potent
of all magic.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.498
Look!

26:23.749 --> 26:26.209
Another of your creations
come to life...

26:26.460 --> 26:28.628
Father! Father!

26:28.837 --> 26:31.256
...the Princess melisande.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.218
My fairy Princess.

26:34.593 --> 26:38.513
Oh, I made her everything
I'd ever desired in a woman.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.807
Well,
what I mean to say...

26:41.016 --> 26:44.185
What you mean to say
is just what you said.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.646
- Will I meet her?
- Yes...

26:47.981 --> 26:49.524
But not dressed like that --

26:49.733 --> 26:53.903
department-store seersucker
all charred by dragon exhaust.

26:54.488 --> 26:58.950
<i>Convento serculum kala!</i>

27:01.245 --> 27:02.746
I hope the fit is correct.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.581
As I explained
during the drop,

27:04.790 --> 27:07.542
my magic is quite limited
these days.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.840
Your highness,
may I present, uh...

27:14.591 --> 27:15.800
Sir Peter.

27:16.009 --> 27:19.804
Sir Peter, this is
the Princess melisande.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.681
Your highness.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.351
Oh, you must be he

27:24.560 --> 27:27.145
who my guardian has sought
to save our world.

27:27.938 --> 27:31.399
Uh, I...Suppose I am.

27:32.067 --> 27:32.734
Am i'.>

27:32.943 --> 27:34.861
trust in antiquity.

27:35.279 --> 27:38.323
Did you summon sir orren
Neville-Smythe, as I requested?

27:38.532 --> 27:40.283
He'll be here
by dawn tomorrow.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.286
Gorbash:
Carolinus! Hello!

27:43.495 --> 27:45.246
Another one!

27:45.455 --> 27:47.457
Hey, look at what
I've been saving!

27:47.666 --> 27:50.335
It's gold, gold, gold!

27:50.544 --> 27:52.629
Oh, that pain again.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.799
I've asked him
not to bellow so.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.343
Simply magnificent sight!

27:58.552 --> 28:03.052
But, sir Peter, it is only
gorbash, our house dragon.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.557
House dragon?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.601
You've met
the entire family.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.437
Gorbash,
this is sir Peter.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.481
Oh, yes.
How do you do?

28:11.690 --> 28:16.190
See? A soup tureen --
a bowl to you -- of solid gold!

28:17.487 --> 28:20.740
Really, gorbash, if your hoard
grows much larger,

28:20.949 --> 28:22.951
there will be no room
for furniture in the house.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.328
Blast! That's what
i keep tellin' ya!

28:25.537 --> 28:27.539
I need a cave of my own!

28:27.748 --> 28:30.709
Soon enough -- when
our quest is victorious.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.836
Well, sir Peter,
old buddy,

28:33.045 --> 28:35.172
your armies better be worth
their salt.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.464
We need power!

28:36.673 --> 28:38.216
My armies?

28:38.467 --> 28:40.385
Sir Peter has brought
no armies.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.721
What?! No armies?!

28:43.597 --> 28:44.764
Will you please --

28:44.973 --> 28:46.307
what good is he?!

28:46.767 --> 28:48.602
What good is he?!

28:48.977 --> 28:50.812
What good is he?!

28:51.146 --> 28:53.815
Calm down!
Just look at yourself.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.442
Release some gas
at once!

28:56.652 --> 28:58.028
Huh? Oh!

28:58.237 --> 28:59.488
And turn your head!

29:03.367 --> 29:05.285
Extraordinary!

29:05.577 --> 29:07.370
The fiery breath
has something to do

29:07.579 --> 29:10.832
with the dragon's ability
to fly, but what?

29:11.041 --> 29:13.043
Lam certain
you will figure it out.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.836
Smrgol: Help!

29:15.420 --> 29:17.255
Help me!

29:21.343 --> 29:22.761
Uncle smrgol!

29:22.970 --> 29:25.806
He's lost his fire!
Help him, gorbash!

29:51.123 --> 29:52.624
What happened, old friend?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.960
My -- my comrades...

29:56.169 --> 29:57.420
My cronies...

29:57.796 --> 29:59.923
The entire flight...

30:00.132 --> 30:00.924
They all --

30:01.550 --> 30:03.552
all turned against me.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.596
The other dragons?
Why?

30:06.805 --> 30:10.225
Because i-l wouldn't
denounce you and --

30:10.600 --> 30:13.436
and join...Ommadon.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.856
The other dragons
have gone over to ommadon?

30:17.065 --> 30:17.982
Aye.

30:18.608 --> 30:21.611
Aye, he's cast
a spell on 'em all --

30:22.529 --> 30:26.908
a flight of dragons
to protect his crown.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.558
What a strange use for gold.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.770
Because dragons tend
to ignite ordinary bedding,

30:55.145 --> 30:57.355
they must find
a soft metal to sleep on.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.275
And gold proves
most comfortable for them.

31:00.984 --> 31:04.237
Ah, hence the dragon's
need for a hoard.

31:05.906 --> 31:09.618
Perhaps we better continue
this conversation in my study --

31:09.826 --> 31:12.036
less chance
of interruption there.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.793
The last realm of magic --
my own personal dream.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.670
Wow! What a movie show!

31:23.131 --> 31:25.550
Oh, sit down, my son.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.135
I've got lots to explain.

31:32.516 --> 31:36.144
So, <i>that</i> is Peter Dickinson.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.438
That is the pathetic fool

31:39.648 --> 31:44.148
carolinus has enlisted
to steal my crown.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.279
Still...

31:47.656 --> 31:51.618
Antiquity must have had
a reason.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.162
Briag...

31:54.746 --> 31:56.205
Fetch me the fool.

32:07.717 --> 32:10.928
And so, you are the one person
from all the centuries

32:11.138 --> 32:12.764
whom antiquity has chosen.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.766
Because I am
a man of science?

32:15.976 --> 32:16.810
Well, aren't you?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.729
I was at first --
honor student, scholarships,

32:19.938 --> 32:22.273
awards, grants, research --

32:22.816 --> 32:24.526
<i>but how it all bored me!</i>

32:24.776 --> 32:26.444
<i>Who could ponder equations</i>

32:26.653 --> 32:28.988
<i>when he had the chance
to imagine dragons?</i>

32:29.197 --> 32:30.281
<i>So I turned
my back on it all</i>

32:30.490 --> 32:32.742
<i>and started on my book,
"the flight of dragons."</i>

32:33.493 --> 32:36.287
<i>"The flight of dragons."</i>

32:36.997 --> 32:39.666
Yes!
Yes, here it is.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.585
"'The flight of dragons'
by Peter Dickinson."

32:42.794 --> 32:44.086
But...

32:44.296 --> 32:45.922
It's impossible!

32:46.256 --> 32:48.383
That's not even
half finished!

32:48.592 --> 32:49.676
Of course not!

32:49.885 --> 32:52.554
This is my library
of unwritten books!

32:52.762 --> 32:56.098
See -- "beowulf,"
"the idylls of the king,"

32:56.308 --> 32:58.310
"gulliver's travels,"
"the tempest,"

32:58.518 --> 33:00.895
"Alice in wonderland,"
"the wizard of oz."

33:01.146 --> 33:03.022
Incredible.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.858
Nice to know you'll
finish it someday, eh?

33:06.067 --> 33:08.778
Oh! No fair peeking
at the end!

33:09.654 --> 33:11.530
You are unique --

33:12.032 --> 33:14.701
a man with one foot
in the realm of magic

33:14.910 --> 33:16.995
and the other
in the realm of science.

33:18.038 --> 33:21.666
Sir Peter, I present you
with the shield of saturn

33:22.000 --> 33:23.835
and the flute of Olympus.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.837
Sir, I'm no warrior.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.006
I'm awkward, clumsy.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.259
Not anymore, my son,

33:31.468 --> 33:34.721
for I believe you have found
your time and place.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.015
You are too modest,
sir Peter.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.684
Let us toast the quest.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.185
No. No, my dear.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.771
Cider makes evil magic
in the stomach.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.773
Oh, poor father.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.110
You know, I had a professor
with your condition,

33:49.444 --> 33:51.237
but it had nothing
to do with magic.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.406
It was plain stomach ulcers.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.075
Milk was the only thing
that helped.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.660
Milk. Really?

33:58.912 --> 34:03.041
Alas, gorbash has devoured
every cow within 20 miles.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.544
Father, waste a little magic
and change the cider.

enchanting, sir Peter?

a talisman.

to bring Peter back.

58:10.362 --> 58:12.614
Gorbash, old friend,

58:13.073 --> 58:15.492
you look like
you've seen a ghost.

58:17.327 --> 58:19.245
Matter of fact,
maybe you have.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.083
Who's laughing --

58:24.376 --> 58:27.128
making such
a confounding racket?

58:27.879 --> 58:30.631
I haven't slept a wink
all night.

58:31.091 --> 58:32.842
Missed my gold and --

58:34.386 --> 58:37.597
arak, good old boy...

58:38.223 --> 58:40.266
I thought you were dead.

58:40.475 --> 58:41.225
You know him?

58:41.435 --> 58:43.437
Know him?
Of course I know him.

58:43.645 --> 58:46.564
Lt's arak, a friend
of the family --

58:46.773 --> 58:49.025
like a big brother to you.

58:49.234 --> 58:50.860
What's the matter, gorbash?

58:51.361 --> 58:53.696
Did the sandmurks steal
your memory?

58:54.448 --> 58:58.118
Sandmurks?
Were there sandmurks here?

58:59.161 --> 59:02.205
Nonsense.
They live by the sea.

59:06.084 --> 59:09.587
Smrgol, you could always sleep
through anything.

59:10.297 --> 59:11.965
The whole trick with sandmurks

59:12.174 --> 59:14.634
is to get the big one --
the queen.

59:14.843 --> 59:16.261
The others are brainless
without her.

59:16.470 --> 59:20.970
Arak, you're supposed to be
dead, killed,

59:21.600 --> 59:24.811
dragged out to sea
by a giant squid.

59:25.854 --> 59:26.980
Quite right.

59:27.939 --> 59:30.399
<i>I woke up underwater.</i>

59:30.609 --> 59:32.235
Awaken, brave arak.

59:32.527 --> 59:35.238
I am solarius,
lord of this realm,

59:35.489 --> 59:37.449
and I can restore you.

59:37.699 --> 59:39.033
Why?

59:40.118 --> 59:42.745
Do I live once more?

59:42.954 --> 59:46.832
No. You are drowned.
But I have a task for you.

59:47.042 --> 59:49.961
Accomplish it,
and you will live again.

59:51.088 --> 59:53.173
Ommadon has enlisted
the sandmurks

59:53.381 --> 59:55.091
to defeat carolinus.

59:55.300 --> 59:57.093
You must destroy them.

59:57.302 --> 59:59.512
Give me life, and I will.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:01.180
After the task,

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:04.850
for nothing living can withstand
their terrible cries.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.105
Destroy them, and you will start
to breathe once more.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:11.357
It seemed like a fair bargain.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:16.112
I did my part, and as soon
as queen sandmurk was gone,

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.071
I started to breathe,

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.657
so solarius
obviously did his.

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:25.621
Good old gorbash.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:28.833
What times we used to have.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.877
Arak, i-I've got to explain.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.503
Explain later!

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:35.172
We have the sun
and must press on.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.633
Forward!

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:40.929
To the realm of the red death
and the red crown of ommadon!

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:03.368
You have friends about?

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:04.661
A female.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:08.540
Trouble --
she's protecting her cubs.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.707
Wait.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:13.669
If he's not careful,

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:16.381
he'll have a whole family
on his hands.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:21.052
I can't say I'd mind the chance
to rest, though.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:25.806
What the blazes?

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.019
Blazes --
we've gotta get loose.

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.853
It's dragon rose.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.192
Hold your breath.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.151
Don't breathe.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.406
Ugly, foul smell.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.532
Those goganflowers.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.127
Can't...Stay...Awake.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.219
[Sniffing 1

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.139
not a wolf for miles.

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:28.661
Well, whoever is doing
the shooting, god bless him.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.080
He certainly can handle
a longbow.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.957
I trust he's on our side.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:35.626
There he is.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:37.461
Good show, man.

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:39.714
I bow to such expertise

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.842
and doff this helmet
to a better man than l.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.428
And <i>I</i> doff my cap to you,
sir orren.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.680
By all that's holy!

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.892
I am Danielle of the woodland,
sir orren.

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:52.268
You know me?

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.479
My father sang
of your exploits.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.606
You have always been
a hero of mine.

01:02:56.815 --> 01:03:00.235
Oh, too good to be true.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.193
Hush!

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:03.029
You must forgive
the wood elves.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:06.157
They are petty outlaws
but good at their jobs.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.827
And this is their leader,
giles of the treetops.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:11.537
For shame.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.330
We saw the dragons.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.792
We thought they were
ommadon's raiders.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:21.088
A thousand pardons, sir orren.
Had we but known --

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:24.175
oh, think nothing of it,
little fellow.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:27.637
The way things are nowadays,
we all get a bit mucked up.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:29.681
Get your men down
from the trees

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:33.183
and awaken the dragons.
Hurry, now.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:37.355
Whatever your quest is,
i should be honored to join.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:42.064
Well, it's a bit unusual,
but, speaking for myself,

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:43.694
I should be honored --

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.113
nay, delighted --
to have you.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.700
I assure you my skills
will prove most useful.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:56.040
<i>Melisande: Danielle
has joined them, father,</i>

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:59.711
<i>and giles,
the elfin outlaw.</i>

01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:02.463
<i>Night is falling,</i>

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:05.758
<i>and they are but a day away</i>

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.970
<i>from the realm of ommadon.</i>

01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:14.225
Looks like an inn.

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:17.728
Hellsway -- last outpost
of civilization

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:19.939
before the realm
of the red death.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:24.648
Arak: And beyond that wall,
all is ommadon's.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.238
Peter: There seems to be
a castle guarding the gate.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:30.491
Aye...Gormlykeep,

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.494
the tollhouse
on the way to Hades,

01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:37.748
with a giant ogre
as tollkeeper.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:40.418
The ogre of gormlykeep?

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:42.670
I've heard tell of him.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:47.758
A lumbering, 3-eyed giant
as big as a house.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.721
Press on -- the hellsway inn.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.933
A good bed and some hospitality
will be welcome tonight.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.692
Innkeeper!

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.402
Innkeeper, I say!

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:08.696
At your service,
sir orren.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.574
How are my friends doing
below?

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:13.326
I will look to them.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:16.579
I do not usually allow
dragons in my cellars,

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:17.872
but for you --

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:21.167
who are those four
somber spoilsports?

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:23.961
Merchants from ommadon's realm.

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:26.297
You allow ommadon's swine?!

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:29.967
Shh! My inn
is between two worlds.

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.760
I cannot take sides.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.263
Well, <i>I</i> don't like 'em!

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:36.849
I'll see to the dragons
downstairs.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:46.484
On to ommadon.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:54.659
More wine?

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.119
Wine not?

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.211
This isn't wine.
It's mead...

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:08.506
But not bad.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:13.928
Peter, how'd that
"beacon street" song go again?

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.473
H' I came from Louisiana <i>h'</i>

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:20.476
h' with a banjo on my knee <i>h'</i>

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.479
<i>h' oh'. Susanna n'</i>

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:26.315
h' oh, don't you cry for me <i>h'</i>

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.817
h' I've gone to Alabama h'

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.986
h' with a banjo on my knee <i>h'</i>

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.740
n' pluck-a pluck-a
pluck-a pluck-a n'

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:36.200
I am ruined!

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:42.498
Those dragons -- they've
devoured over 100 hams,

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:47.290
60 cheeses, and at least
30 barrels of my finest mead.

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:51.173
Tut, tut.
You will be well paid.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.509
Dragons have gold,
you know.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.177
They have it with them?

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:58.056
You will be paid eventually.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.431
My father told me,

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:03.019
"never extend credit
to a dragon."

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:07.106
Shh. Too late
for such caterwaulings --

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:10.692
too late,
for the morrow brings --

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.695
[yawns 1

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:16.449
your rooms are ready.
Will you finally to bed?

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.493
Aye, good innkeeper.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.287
For we may not see
another night.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.041
I'll show you the way.

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:29.294
<i>Melisande:
And, lo, they sleep,</i>

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:33.257
<i>an all-too-brief surcease,
well-earned.</i>

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:35.968
<i>And but for the watchful moon</i>

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:39.471
<i>keeping her vigil o'er
the slumbering countryside,</i>

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:41.391
<i>all is still.</i>

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.477
Aaaaah!

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:45.978
What is it, child?

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:47.563
Something looms --

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.940
huge, terrifying,

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.362
with two mad eyes
where three once were!

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:55.947
Carolinus:
The ogre.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:59.241
Ommadon has sent
the ogre of gormlykeep.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:19.386
Smrgol, look!

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:24.095
Hmm?
Ach, what a terrible mess.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:25.684
Did we --

01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:27.685
don't -- don't admit
anything.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:28.854
Look!

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.692
The innkeeper --
murdered.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:33.984
It's horrible.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:37.821
I smell ogre.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.658
Giles: Help! Over here!

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:44.995
Giles, are you all right?

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.497
I'm near parboiled
to a fare-thee-well,

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.084
but I'd sooner be cooked
than crushed by that thing.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:51.627
Tell me what happened, man.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.962
I hid in the soup
when I first heard him.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.423
He reached in the window

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.426
and took Danielle and sir orren
from where they lay.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:14.858
Then off he goes.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:15.984
Where to?

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:18.654
The dungeon at gormlykeep,
no doubt.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.823
There they'll hold 'em
till ommadon decides

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:24.535
what foul deed
to perform on 'em.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:25.828
Oh, no.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.622
A fat lot of good <i>I</i> am
to this quest,

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:31.457
overcome by the sandmurks
and trapped by the elves' net

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.544
and in a stupor
when the ogre attacks.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.796
Now, now, Peter,
you've got a job to do,

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.298
and you'll do it.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.216
What's that?

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:43.136
Take the ogre of gormlykeep.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:50.560
Let me tell you something
about how to fight ogres.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.270
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:56.817
Good. The first thing to know
is about the bones in an ogre.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:57.818
They're thick.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:01.863
See, an ogre's arms and legs
are mainly bone.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:04.158
That's why biting is no use.

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:08.371

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:03.199
<i>volla.</i>

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:05.619
I guess logic <i>is</i> stronger
than magic.

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:09.121
Stronger than my magic?

01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:15.920
Noooooooo!

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:22.006
L...Have gathered...
The sum total

01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:25.513
of the world's evil

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:28.599
in one place,

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:32.062
and that place is me!

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:41.400
I...Am...Invincible!

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:46.200
No magic stronger!

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.081
L...Am the world,

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:56.002
and the world is ommadon.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:10.684
I can do anything!
Test me!

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:14.020
Allow me to reach up
and pluck down the sun.

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:15.563
You can't do that.

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:20.272
Why?! Why, you insect?!
Why?!

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:23.363
Seven heads,
and each one a simpleton.

01:27:23.655 --> 01:27:25.239
Don't you know
what you reach for

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:27.325
isn't in that position
anymore?

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:30.203
The sun is the sun!

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.038
I can see where it is!

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:33.873
Where it was, pipsqueak.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.249
Any schoolboy knows

01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:39.959
that light travels
at 186,300 miles per second.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:43.549
What you see is the sun's
position 8 1/2 minutes ago.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:47.136
No magic but mine
can move the sun!

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:49.138
I command it!

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:52.308
Not magic, gashead --
mathematics.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:55.353
And that's the answer
to why antiquity chose me.

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.146
You are magic <i>--</i>
mere illusion.

01:27:57.355 --> 01:28:01.692
I am science <i>--</i>
logic and the truth.

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:04.445
[ Roaring 1

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.074
you don't frighten me.

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:10.285
Nothing so horrible
could be real.

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:12.078
I deny you!

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:16.374
Deny me,
and you deny all magic.

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:19.294
Say it, then!

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:22.422
I deny all magic!

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:26.592
Deny this...

01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:40.606
Those incantations
can't hurt me.

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:43.026
I have some incantations
of my own.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.197
How about "a body in motion
tends to stay in motion"?

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:51.989
"Protons have 1,832 times
the mass of electrons."

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.164
"All light is bent
or refracted

01:28:57.374 --> 01:28:59.376
"as it goes from one medium
to another,

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:01.794
"save in a direction
perpendicular to the interface

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.504
between the two mediums..."

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:08.213
Aaaaaaaah!

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:11.596
"...upon the variations
from their specific type

01:29:11.805 --> 01:29:13.681
which individuals present."

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.934
"Gravity varies as to the
inverse square of the distance."

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:19.603
"The velocity of light
is equal to the wavelength

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:21.856
times the frequency
of vibration..."

01:29:22.983 --> 01:29:25.193
Aaaaaah!

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:28.613
"...are determined by the masses
present in space and time."

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:32.867
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:37.910
Come, devils, witches,
demons, ogres, trolls,

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:41.834
sandmurks, harpies,
ghouls, sorcerers.

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:45.338
Come algebra, anatomy,
astronomy, biology,

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:48.383
chemistry, geology,
geometry, mathematics,

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:51.011
meteorology, mineralogy,
oceanography,

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:54.513
paleontology, physics,
psychology, sociology,

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:56.599
trigonometry, and zoology.

01:29:56.808 --> 01:30:00.770
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:31.467
Behold, my darling --
the magic realm!

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:32.843
And look!

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:43.312
Caroli-i-i-nus!

01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:58.453
I am home.

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:02.749
<i>We</i> are home.

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:07.458
Well, gorbash,
awake at last?

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:12.425
Arak! I thought you were dead
beneath the sea!

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:15.428
No.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:16.930
Old friend!

01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:19.557
Oh, thank heaven,
you're still intact!

01:31:19.766 --> 01:31:22.393
We've won!
Sir Peter, we've won!

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:23.853
I don't understand.

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:27.732
Why the blazes do you call me
by this man name?

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:29.275
Gorbash?

01:31:29.526 --> 01:31:31.152
Of course gorbash.

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:33.029
Why so shocked,
sir orren --

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:35.656
you who practically
hatched me?

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:37.992
Sir Peter is gone.

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:40.036
Gone?! Where?!

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:41.829
As carolinus hoped,

01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:45.833
he used his knowledge
of science to deny magic.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:49.420
By denying magic,
he is lost to us forever.

01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:50.504
Melisande: Father!

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:53.133
Melisande!
She's awake!

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:56.343
Father!
Sir Peter was here!

01:31:56.553 --> 01:31:58.721
Yes. Yes, my darling.

01:31:59.014 --> 01:31:59.848
Look!

01:32:00.306 --> 01:32:02.182
The crown of ommadon.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:05.478
As foretold,
it awakened you.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:08.690
No. The kiss awakened me.

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:10.150
The kiss?

01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:12.902
<i>I was lost
in that sleep of death.</i>

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:15.696
<i>Then I felt his lips
upon mine.</i>

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:17.698
<i>I opened my eyes,</i>

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:20.075
<i>and, for an instant,
i saw his smile.</i>

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:22.370
<i>Then he was gone.</i>

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.539
<i>Awakened you
with a kiss, eh?</i>

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:31.041
<i>Well, perhaps he isn't
completely lost to magic.</i>

01:32:32.297 --> 01:32:36.050
May -- may I join him,
father?

01:32:36.593 --> 01:32:38.386
Of all questions,

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.721
I feared that the most.

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:42.765
May I?

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:45.601
That must be
your decision, child.

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:51.065
Go...And you may never return
to the magic realm,

01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:53.818
for even now, the great dome
of lnvisibility

01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:55.069
grows over our world

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:57.780
to protect its sanctity
for all time,

01:32:58.656 --> 01:33:01.450
and no one on the outside
may enter its boundaries,

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:06.080
save for the length of a dream
or flash of an inspiration.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:09.667
But it will stay
through the years

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:11.627
and the centuries
and the ages

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.297
a part of man for all time,

01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:19.464
and whenever man needs magic,
we will be here.

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:24.974
11!

01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:27.977
Your dragon fire
melts my ice!

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:30.229
Oh! You win!

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:32.607
Look, I gotta get back
to work.

01:33:33.066 --> 01:33:35.943
Wait a minute.
I do have some business now.

01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:38.279
I told you
that watch of yours --

01:33:38.655 --> 01:33:39.822
not the watch.

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:41.115
This.

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:42.908
Ye gods!

01:33:43.243 --> 01:33:44.494
Solid gold!

01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:46.328
Where did you find this?

01:33:46.663 --> 01:33:49.082
Oh, I had a horde.

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:51.417
I don't blame you
for not telling.

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:53.336
You can live off this
for years!

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:57.089
Travel --
Europe, Asia, cruises.

01:33:57.423 --> 01:34:00.300
No. I'll be satisfied
with a cottage

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:03.221
surrounded by trees
near a stream...

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:05.723
Like one I used to know.

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:09.727
Oh. Can I help you, miss?

01:34:11.855 --> 01:34:15.024
Where do you kids
get these things?

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:18.152
Melisande!
