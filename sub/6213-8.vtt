00:07.841 --> 00:09.376
( <i>murmuring</i> )

00:15.282 --> 00:17.184
Well, well, well,
what's new, new, new?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.719
Oh, Sabrina, hi.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.720
Arthur and I were just

00:19.720 --> 00:21.588
having a little
discussion about physics.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.124
Oh, looked a little more
like chemistry to me.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.826
So, I didn't know
you and Professor Carlin--

00:25.826 --> 00:28.695
or should I say Arthur--
were involved again.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.797
We've been seeing
each other, casually.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.432
He was just
keeping me company

00:32.432 --> 00:34.301
while I wait for
President Banning.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.103
My meeting was scheduled
an hour ago.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.504
I wonder what's keeping him.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.506
I'm sure he's just tied up
with something important.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.608
HILDA:
Stop, that tickles!

00:42.009 --> 00:43.644
( <i>giggling</i> ):
That tickles, too!

00:43.644 --> 00:44.878
Say it ain't so.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.547
Oh, I would if I could.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.651
Hi, Zellie, Sabrina.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.020
This is what
higher education
has sunk to.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.522
I love the academic life,
and guess what?

00:55.522 --> 00:57.758
I just made the Dean's List.

01:03.630 --> 01:10.037

01:41.501 --> 01:42.502
Could somebody
get that?

01:42.502 --> 01:44.605
This article
on hairstyle makeovers

01:44.605 --> 01:46.106
is too good to put down.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.110
Ooh, love Allen Iverson
in a scrunchie.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.912
Hi. Hope I'm not
bothering you.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.213
This will only
take a minute.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.448
Take that.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.085
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

01:58.085 --> 01:59.086
Checking out my new digs.

01:59.086 --> 01:59.486
What digs?

01:59.486 --> 02:00.387
We're the only ones

02:00.387 --> 02:01.421
who live in this house.

02:01.421 --> 02:02.556
With the possible
exception

02:02.556 --> 02:03.323
of microorganisms

02:03.323 --> 02:06.259
that may have
crawled up from
the earth's crust.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.394
Or not.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.695
The housing office said

02:08.695 --> 02:09.363
there was going
to be a vacancy here

02:09.363 --> 02:10.931
because someone
didn't pay their rent.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.165
That's ridiculous.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.300
Everyone paid
their rent, right?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.368
Right, which means

02:14.368 --> 02:16.169
you and your tape measure
can take a hike.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.404
Okay, okay.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.239
I guess I'll just have
to find another place

02:19.239 --> 02:21.575
big enough to hold my
high-frequency radio telescope.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.743
Come back!

02:22.743 --> 02:24.044
We'll throw someone out!

02:24.411 --> 02:27.080
I don't have time for
this bureaucratic stupidity.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.448
I have to go to
advanced calculus

02:28.448 --> 02:31.218
and deal with
my own stupidity.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.687
Can you believe
that housing office?

02:33.687 --> 02:34.821
Tell me about it.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.490
They said they'd
give me an extension.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.758
Extension?

02:37.758 --> 02:39.893
Morgan, you're the one
that didn't pay the rent?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.094
It's not my fault!

02:41.094 --> 02:42.963
Daddy put me on a tight budget

02:42.963 --> 02:46.033
and I had a couple
of emergencies.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.167
Prada pumps.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.070
I bought them in burnished
eggplant and spicy rust.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.238
Well, you got to
trade them in for

02:51.238 --> 02:52.673
some khaki-green
hundred-dollar bills

02:52.673 --> 02:54.541
or you're going
to be living out on the street.

02:54.541 --> 02:58.545
True, but shoe-wise,
I'm set for fall and winter.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.150
Morgan would be
totally embarrassed

03:03.150 --> 03:04.584
if she knew
I was asking you this

03:04.584 --> 03:05.986
but we've got to help her out.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.888
Mismanaging money
could happen to anyone.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.889
Couldn't happen to me.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.657
I don't have
enough money
to mismanage.

03:10.657 --> 03:13.193
I'd rather discuss who gets
Morgan's spacious bedroom.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.327
Mine is so small, I have

03:14.327 --> 03:16.363
to store my allergy medication
in my socks.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.864
At least you get to do it
in private.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.033
I have a roommate who watches
my every hygienic move.

03:20.033 --> 03:20.667
Right, like I care that

03:20.667 --> 03:23.837
you're a serial exfoliator.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.505
Guys, look, a roommate
is in crisis

03:25.505 --> 03:27.040
and I believe if
push came to shove

03:27.040 --> 03:28.475
she'd be there for us.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.177
This is Morgan
we're talking about?

03:30.177 --> 03:31.478
Look, all I can say is

03:31.478 --> 03:33.814
underneath Morgan's
shallow exterior...

03:33.814 --> 03:35.415
Is a shallow interior.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.750
Right, but underneath that

03:36.750 --> 03:38.752
is a decent, okay person.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.555
That's why I'm taking the money
I was saving for Josh's birthday

03:41.555 --> 03:43.690
and loaning it to Morgan.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.227
Okay, fine, I'm in.

03:47.227 --> 03:47.994
Me, too.

03:48.095 --> 03:48.762
But it's going to be

03:48.762 --> 03:49.563
pretty tight
for me this month.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.498
No luxuries, like--
what is that thing called?

03:51.498 --> 03:52.799
Oh, yeah-- food.

03:52.799 --> 03:56.069
And I'll be giving up
my lifeline-- Sudafed.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.510
Hi. Whatcha doing?

04:03.510 --> 04:05.946
Salem and I joined
the Other Realm Book Club.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.080
Oh, how nice for you.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.950
Well, while you're sitting
around, reading about life

04:09.950 --> 04:11.485
I'll be out living it.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.254
I've been invited to
a dinner party at Wayne's house.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.489
A dinner party?

04:15.489 --> 04:17.424
With the president
of my college?

04:17.424 --> 04:18.992
Oh, it's just
an intimate gathering--

04:18.992 --> 04:20.393
President Banning, <i>moi</i>

04:20.393 --> 04:22.262
and the people
who are really close to him.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.965
I wonder why
I wasn't invited.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.833
I thought Wayne and I
were friends.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.369
Well, maybe he doesn't want
to mix business with pleasure.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.204
Besides, you have a full life.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.439
You have your
reading group...

04:32.439 --> 04:33.807
with your cat.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.543
We may not be
the Algonquin Round Table

04:36.543 --> 04:38.712
but we have better snacks.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.647
Hilda, this is really
making me mad.

04:40.647 --> 04:41.882
Oh, come on.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.417
It's just one little
fabulous soiree.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.886
You could have
put in a good word

04:45.886 --> 04:48.021
and gotten Arthur and me
invited to that party.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.724
Instead, you throw it
in my face and laugh-- why?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.526
What are you getting
out of this?

04:52.526 --> 04:55.028
Inner peace, and from
what I understand

04:55.028 --> 04:56.563
a very tasty veal chop.

04:56.563 --> 05:00.300
Oh, the gravy, the gravy!

05:00.934 --> 05:03.136
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

05:03.136 --> 05:06.573
( <i>clears throat</i> )

05:06.573 --> 05:07.908
Ah, Hilda.

05:07.908 --> 05:08.942
Hi.
Hi.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.811
May I take your wrap?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.245
Sure, but if you don't mind

05:12.245 --> 05:14.481
I'd like to keep
my skirt on for the party.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.049
Talk to me after
the hors d'oeuvres.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.851
( <i>laughter</i> )

05:17.851 --> 05:20.120
Uh, Wayne, perhaps you can
settle the debate I'm having

05:20.120 --> 05:21.955
with the chair of
the philosophy department.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.224
Is this real or imitation crab?

05:24.224 --> 05:25.892
It's as real
as my affection

05:25.892 --> 05:28.195
for this charming
creature next to me.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.963
Hilda, do you know
Professor Carlin?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.665
Sure, he's dating
my older sister.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.433
Oh, excuse me.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.903
And, apparently,
this little trollop.

05:36.903 --> 05:40.006
Ashley, would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

05:40.006 --> 05:41.341
I know this is
a little awkward

05:41.341 --> 05:43.176
but there's no need
to get upset.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.811
Oops, too late.

05:44.811 --> 05:45.412
Zelda and I have an agreement

05:45.412 --> 05:47.347
that we don't date
each other exclusively.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.648
Oh, really?
Well, according to

05:48.648 --> 05:50.417
my understanding of
the word "agreement"

05:50.417 --> 05:51.852
both people have
to be in on it.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.986
Both people are.

05:52.986 --> 05:53.987
Yeah, you and Ashley.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.356
And I suppose when she needs
help with her homework

05:56.356 --> 05:57.757
you're right on top of it.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.493
No.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.296
So, have you guys decided
what you want yet?

06:03.296 --> 06:04.331
I'd like a frappuccino

06:04.331 --> 06:05.999
but since I lent
Morgan all my money

06:05.999 --> 06:07.367
I'll go with water.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.903
That sounds good--
make it two.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.474
Wow, a ten-dollar tip?

06:14.474 --> 06:16.543
That's more than I ever got
when I worked here.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.911
What's your secret?

06:17.911 --> 06:22.282
Flirting heavily with any guy
named Clyde, Irving or Morty.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.085
And just so you know,
this money

06:25.085 --> 06:27.287
is going to help buy your
surprise birthday present

06:27.287 --> 06:29.022
which, by the way, you'll
never guess in a million years.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.925
Photographer's vest,
medium, navy blue.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.426
Aha! Royal blue.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.729
Seriously, Sabrina,
those are really expensive.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.464
You're going
to have to serve Morty

06:37.464 --> 06:39.266
a lot of coffee cake
to afford that.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.533
I'm on it-- hey, Morty

06:40.533 --> 06:44.137
those new trifocals make
you look ten years younger.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.175
Oh, that purse!

06:49.175 --> 06:51.077
Ever heard of the
Endangered Species Act?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.546
Ever heard of shaving cream?

06:55.181 --> 06:56.549
Hey, Morgan,
nice ensemble.

06:56.549 --> 06:57.984
Where'd you get the purse?

06:57.984 --> 06:59.152
Is it new?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.687
To me.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.123
Before that, I believe it
belonged to the alligator.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.925
Excuse us.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.261
Quick question:
Why is Morgan buying

07:08.261 --> 07:10.597
an expensive alligator purse
when she owes us money?

07:10.597 --> 07:10.964
I don't know.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.833
Maybe it was a gift, or maybe
it's a cheap synthetic--

07:13.833 --> 07:15.735
you know, schmalligator.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.203
You don't really
believe that, do you?

07:17.203 --> 07:18.772
I'm giving her
the benefit of the doubt.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.140
She said she's going
to pay us back

07:20.140 --> 07:22.042
and we should believe her.
Any other questions?

07:22.042 --> 07:23.843
Yes. If there's
a schmalligator

07:23.843 --> 07:26.046
is there also
a schmocodile?

07:29.482 --> 07:30.650
Oh, I'm starved.

07:30.650 --> 07:33.219
What are you guys
having for dinner?

07:33.219 --> 07:34.454
BOTH:
Creamed corn.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.056
Oh, didn't you have that
last night?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.657
Had it for breakfast, too.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.794
I go through
weird food phases myself.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.530
One week, all I wanted
was shiitake mushrooms.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.332
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

07:45.332 --> 07:46.399
Now I'm on a sushi kick.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.036
I'll give her a sushi kick.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.073
Hi. Someone ordered
the Mount Fuji special.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.674
Someone right here.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.509
Just keep the change.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.144
Wow, thanks!

07:58.144 --> 08:00.480
God bless you.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.782
Miles, Roxy-- anybody
want some sushi?

08:02.782 --> 08:04.451
It's the best in town.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.220
I can't believe
you ordered sushi.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.055
I know, I've heard
all those stories

08:09.055 --> 08:10.523
about raw fish and bacteria

08:10.523 --> 08:12.192
but you don't have to worry

08:12.192 --> 08:14.260
if you're willing
to pay top dollar.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.064
Yeah, <i>our</i> top dollars.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.799
Hi. What's going on?

08:19.799 --> 08:20.934
Don't "hi" me.

08:20.934 --> 08:21.768
You told us
Morgan was broke

08:21.768 --> 08:25.005
and now she's spending our money
on purses and fish.

08:25.972 --> 08:26.773
Yikes!

08:26.773 --> 08:29.376
This is what they're getting
for freshwater eel?

08:29.376 --> 08:30.510
This is ridiculous.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.911
I'll go talk
to Morgan right now.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.180
Thank you, and how would
you like your corn served?

08:34.180 --> 08:35.482
To someone else.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.517
( <i>knock on door</i> )

08:37.517 --> 08:38.651
Morgan, it's me.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.622
Come on in, and bring
your complexion problems.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.858
Why? Are we having
a blackhead party?

08:44.858 --> 08:45.792
We may.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.460
Look what I just bought--

08:47.460 --> 08:48.895
an electronic pore cleanser.

08:48.895 --> 08:49.929
Now there's no need
to worry about

08:49.929 --> 08:52.198
those bumpy things
on the side of your nose.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.000
Funny, I don't worry about
stuff like that.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.402
I worry about
why you're spending

08:55.402 --> 08:57.170
the money you borrowed
on frivolous junk.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.038
Sabrina...

08:58.038 --> 08:59.439
It's immoral, it's unethical

08:59.439 --> 09:02.075
and nobody gives a hoot about
the side of your nose.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.010
They will once I shrink
these pores.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.145
Sabrina

09:05.145 --> 09:06.446
I am hurt that you would think

09:06.446 --> 09:07.847
I wasn't going to pay you back.

09:07.847 --> 09:11.084
Oh, and why would I think that?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.086
Relax, everything is fixed.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.421
I called my dad

09:14.421 --> 09:15.989
told him about
my budgeting problems

09:15.989 --> 09:17.524
and he said he was
going to send me

09:17.524 --> 09:18.658
a big, fat envelope.

09:18.658 --> 09:19.959
It'll be here tomorrow.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.828
Whew, that is such a relief.

09:21.828 --> 09:26.299
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some suctioning to do.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.735
Won't I miss that.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.509
I understand <i>why</i>
the caterer was naked.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.946
I don't understand why
there weren't any pictures!

09:39.946 --> 09:42.015
Zelda, I need
to talk to...

09:42.015 --> 09:44.084
Oh, hi, everybody.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.886
Um, just ignore us.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.756
Hilda, you interrupted
my book club.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.391
They can wait.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.725
There's something
I have to tell you.

09:52.725 --> 09:53.860
What is it?

09:54.527 --> 09:55.628
I can't tell you.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.664
Well, then, since I have guests
in the other room

09:57.664 --> 09:59.099
perhaps I'll go back.

09:59.099 --> 10:03.002
Your boyfriend is
two-timing you
with a 25-year-old.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.439
Gosh, look at the time.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.242
Hey, who's up for strudel
in the Other Realm?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.579
Hilda, you ruined
my book club.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.214
You've got
bigger problems, sister.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.048
Arthur Carlin--

10:15.048 --> 10:17.350
the man you wanted to take
to the dinner party--

10:17.350 --> 10:19.385
was at the dinner party
with someone else.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.753
SALEM:
So we heard.

10:20.753 --> 10:23.256
A 25-year-old chicky-poo.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.192
Only 630 years younger than you.

10:26.192 --> 10:29.195
Said the cat who spikes
his iced tea with Metamucil.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.231
I like the texture.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.634
And get this: Then Carlin
comes up with this lame excuse

10:34.634 --> 10:37.137
that you two have an agreement
to see other people.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.304
Well, we do.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.540
I'm the one that suggested it.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.942
Look, Hilda, to be honest,
it would have been nice

10:42.942 --> 10:44.677
if Arthur had taken me
to that party

10:44.677 --> 10:45.712
but he didn't.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.013
I'm okay with it.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.149
Likely story.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.651
Don't hold anything in, sister.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.186
Express your pain.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.587
The only pain I feel

10:54.587 --> 10:56.990
is your nails
digging into my back.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.091
Now, if you'll excuse me

10:58.091 --> 10:59.926
I'm going to start
my book for next week.

10:59.926 --> 11:03.396
Don't you even want
to know what she looks like?

11:03.396 --> 11:04.831
No!
Yes!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.200
I don't get it--
why is the mail late

11:07.200 --> 11:08.735
the one day
we're expecting money?

11:08.735 --> 11:10.003
If we don't get
our money back, we're not

11:10.003 --> 11:11.371
going to be eating anything.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.239
All I know is
I'm down to three decongestants

11:13.239 --> 11:14.274
and a packet of ketchup.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.109
And our physics class
starts in seven minutes.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.377
Oh, you guys go.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.246
I'll stay here and keep
an eye out for the cash

11:20.246 --> 11:22.916
and here is some Sweet 'N Low
for the road.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.923
Has the mailman been here yet?

11:29.923 --> 11:30.657
Nope.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.125
I wish he'd hurry up.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.127
I want to get
to Bloomingdale's.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.196
I'm trying to improve
my walking time

11:36.196 --> 11:37.830
between cosmetics and shoes.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.832
Well, it's better than
having no goals at all.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.334
He's here!

11:42.135 --> 11:44.604
Ah, yes, the mother lode!

11:44.604 --> 11:46.506
Careful, don't
tear the money!

11:46.506 --> 11:48.141
Oh, this isn't money.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.909
These are my bills.

11:49.909 --> 11:52.445
"The Oklahoma Earring
Trading Company"?

11:52.445 --> 11:54.480
"Just Washcloths"?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.649
Oh, the check
must be in here.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.952
"Dear Morgan...

11:58.952 --> 12:01.554
"I hope you're enjoying
all the purchases you made

12:01.554 --> 12:03.456
"because you won't
be making any more.

12:03.456 --> 12:07.594
At least not
with my money. Dad."

12:07.727 --> 12:11.998
Oh, my God, I've been cut off.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.100
I'm broke!

12:14.267 --> 12:15.235
Oh!

12:15.235 --> 12:18.605
That makes four of us.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.279
Daddy says until I learn
how to manage my money

12:26.279 --> 12:28.815
I'm not getting any more.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.384
Do I have a lawsuit here?!

12:31.384 --> 12:34.153
Morgan, I wasn't the only one
that helped you out.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.989
Miles and Roxie chipped in, too.

12:35.989 --> 12:39.892
They did? I had no idea
how much they cared about me.

12:39.892 --> 12:40.793
They don't.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.895
I guilted them
into doing it.

12:42.895 --> 12:45.031
Still, they took money
out of their own pockets

12:45.031 --> 12:46.065
and gave it to me.

12:46.065 --> 12:49.035
Sabrina, I am hopeless.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.038
I just wish that somewhere
along the way

12:52.038 --> 12:54.240
someone had taught me
how to stretch a dollar.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.642
Stretch a dollar?

12:55.642 --> 12:56.643
That's a good idea.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.444
Morgan, how much money
do you have left?

12:58.678 --> 12:59.646
A dollar.

12:59.646 --> 13:00.747
Thank you.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.315
Why are you taking
my last dollar?!

13:02.315 --> 13:03.116
None of your business.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.752
Your business is to go out
and get a job <i>at</i> a business.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.754
And I mean business!

13:09.022 --> 13:10.823
A job?

13:10.823 --> 13:15.828
I guess this is what they mean
by "bottoming out."

13:20.333 --> 13:21.100
Be right with you.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.869
Got to hang tens.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.037
( <i>chuckles</i> )

13:24.037 --> 13:25.738
How can I help you?

13:25.738 --> 13:27.940
I don't know. I've seen your ads
on Other Realm Cable

13:27.940 --> 13:29.776
but I'm still not sure
exactly what you do.

13:29.776 --> 13:33.046
Well, we launder money,
pinch pennies

13:33.046 --> 13:36.849
and, starting May 1st,
serve Cajun buffalo wings.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.185
Well, can you stretch
a Mortal dollar?

13:39.185 --> 13:42.255
Faster than a one-eyed possum
on a greased-up armadillo.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.656
I'll assume that's pretty fast.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.657
Here. Go crazy.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.992
You know, if you
help stretch

13:45.992 --> 13:47.694
you get a lot more
bang for your buck

13:47.694 --> 13:49.529
and I'll give you
a buffalo wing coupon.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.964
Oh, I've never stretched
anything before.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.900
Well, except maybe
the truth now and then.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.535
Well, just grab
the other half

13:55.535 --> 13:57.170
and give a good pull.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.373
Wow. This money's really hard
to hang on to.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.874
I hate this part.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.979
Oh, but I love this part. Whoo!

14:06.979 --> 14:09.816
Hey, I think
there's a game show here.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.319
You animal!

14:13.319 --> 14:17.857
It's like he grew an extra hand
over the weekend.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.293
CARLIN:
Isn't she gorgeous?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.328
She takes my breath away.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.564
Wow. I can
see why.
Mm-hmm.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.333
I think this calls
for a little Hearing Helper.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.901
She is a hottie.

14:28.901 --> 14:31.504
I cannot see how this babe
is your girlfriend.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.806
Well, it's not official yet,
but I'm working on it.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.041
I can definitely see myself

14:35.041 --> 14:37.009
spending the rest of my life
with this one.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.010
Oh, really?

14:38.010 --> 14:39.979
Well, here's what I see.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.318
Nobody makes a fool
of Zelda Spellman except me.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.921
And not only is he
showing off pictures
of that little hottie

14:48.921 --> 14:52.325
he's also talking about
spending the rest of
his life with her.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.693
Is that in the agreement?

14:53.693 --> 14:56.028
Hilda, we don't have
anything in writing.

14:56.028 --> 14:56.896
That was your
first mistake.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.198
Your second is letting him
string you along.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.434
Your third is reading
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

15:01.434 --> 15:03.302
Just watch reruns
of <i>Law and Order.</i>

15:03.302 --> 15:04.570
Oh, maybe you're right.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.273
If Arthur really is
that serious about
someone else

15:07.273 --> 15:09.909
I should at least
know about it.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.045
Oh, hallelujah!
My work here is done.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.615
Now, who else's life
can I get involved in?

15:15.615 --> 15:16.682
( <i>gasps</i> )

15:16.682 --> 15:18.117
( <i>yowls</i> )

15:24.791 --> 15:26.159
You got my money.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.594
Yep, every last cent
that Morgan owed us.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.863
Here's yours and yours.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.132
All right! This calls
for a celebration.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.700
Way ahead of you.
I ordered pizza.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.036
I'll eat anything that
wasn't grown in a husk.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.204
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

15:39.472 --> 15:40.873
Hi. What do I owe you?

15:40.873 --> 15:42.308
$11.50.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.580
Very funny. Now, how
about the real stuff?

15:47.580 --> 15:48.648
This isn't the real stuff?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.650
I thought it was.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.952
Here. Take mine.

15:54.353 --> 15:57.023
Guys, I got pies
that are getting soggy.

15:57.023 --> 16:01.360
Can somebody please give me
some usable cash?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.566
Sabrina, what's going on here?

16:06.566 --> 16:08.267
Oh, uh, you know, Morgan's dad

16:08.267 --> 16:10.203
has a really wacky
sense of humor.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.606
I bet he bought this fake money
at a joke shop, you know

16:13.606 --> 16:15.808
to teach her a funny lesson.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.778
It really is funny, isn't it?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.379
My sides are splitting.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.547
And so am I.

16:21.547 --> 16:22.548
I can't believe this.

16:22.548 --> 16:23.683
Me, neither.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.985
I was this close to starch
<i>and</i> the protein.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.753
Oh, well, there's
still good news.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.088
Even if the money is fake

16:29.088 --> 16:31.224
Morgan's out looking
for a job right now.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.258
She'll pay us back.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.427
With what?
Exploding quarters?

16:34.427 --> 16:36.696
It's a jungle
out there.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.799
I need a Perrier
and a biscotti.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.666
How'd the job hunt go?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.902
Very disappointing.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.770
None of the places
that I went to

16:44.770 --> 16:46.172
lived up to my standards.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.206
<i>Your</i> standards?

16:47.206 --> 16:48.508
Morgan, you're
supposed to be

16:48.508 --> 16:49.876
living up to
<i>their</i> standards.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.744
You know, you're never
going to get a job

16:51.744 --> 16:53.679
unless you stop acting
like a prima donna.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.948
Well, I don't know if I can.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.684
This is the way
I've always acted.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.387
Little tip: It doesn't
work for you anymore.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.289
It's not working
for us, either.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.224
Last night
I ate gum for dinner.

17:05.224 --> 17:07.293
We're not sunk yet. Morgan,
you work on your attitude

17:07.293 --> 17:08.361
and I'm going to go talk

17:08.361 --> 17:10.263
to the guy responsible
for this whole money mess.

17:10.263 --> 17:14.433
Finally, someone's going
to stand up to my father.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.070
Wally, I got a problem.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.372
You and me both.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.041
Bad enough I got to launder
money for these dang customers.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.776
Now they want me
to fluff and fold it.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.945
Well, this dang customer
wants to know why

17:25.945 --> 17:28.147
the dollar we stretched
turned into mini money.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.618
I guess that's what it's worth
in the Mortal Realm.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.719
You know, in Neptune

17:33.719 --> 17:35.321
you'd be living like a king.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.256
You'd freeze your butt off,
though.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.424
Well, can you do something?

17:38.424 --> 17:40.960
My friend drained my bank
account, and she won't get a job

17:40.960 --> 17:43.062
because she thinks
she's too good for everybody.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.631
Oh, that's a whole different
bucket of bait.

17:45.631 --> 17:48.000
Your friend doesn't
need money stretched.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.535
She needs Humble Pie.

17:49.535 --> 17:50.770
You mean that dark brown stuff

17:50.770 --> 17:52.405
that causes you
to become really modest

17:52.405 --> 17:53.940
and leaves that
unpleasant aftertaste?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.241
Not the way my wife makes it.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.777
Patty, come out here!

17:57.777 --> 18:02.648
Got a girl out here
who wants one of your
marvelous Humble Pies!

18:02.648 --> 18:04.984
They're really not
all that good.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.687
I can't bake anywhere near
as well as my mother.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.189
I'm not even worthy
of her recipe.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.525
Well, looks like someone's
been picking at the pie.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.694
Ain't nobody a bigger
pie picker than my Patty.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.563
Sold. I'll take one Humble Pie.

18:18.664 --> 18:19.799
Thanks.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.001
Sabrina, I'm not much
of a pie person

18:22.001 --> 18:24.704
and I'm really trying
to cut back on desserts.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.973
Oh, but this pie
is super low
in arrogance...

18:26.973 --> 18:28.007
I mean, calories.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.343
You know, you have been
out busting your butt

18:30.343 --> 18:31.510
trying to get a job

18:31.510 --> 18:34.046
and I thought
you could use
a little treat.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.581
It does look good.

18:36.415 --> 18:37.450
And you're right.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.218
After what I have
been through

18:39.218 --> 18:42.054
no one deserves
a little pampering
more than me.

18:42.054 --> 18:42.955
Absolutely.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.297
Mmm...

18:51.697 --> 18:53.332
This is fabulous.

18:57.103 --> 19:00.339
Mmm. Out of this world.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.308
( <i>magical ping</i> )

19:02.308 --> 19:04.744
And far better than I deserve.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.912
Oh, you deserve it.
Keep shoveling.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.315
This is really starting
to make me feel...

19:09.315 --> 19:10.783
Humble enough
to go look for work?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.451
Exactly.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.954
I just hope
that I'm worthy

19:14.954 --> 19:18.557
of all those wonderful
employers out there.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.292
Oh, I'm sure you are...

19:20.292 --> 19:21.327
now.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.497
Hilda, I can handle
this myself.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.832
You could, but then,
where would the fun be for me?

19:26.832 --> 19:27.333
( <i>gasps</i> )

19:27.333 --> 19:28.267
There he is!

19:28.267 --> 19:29.568
I know what
he looks like.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.737
Uh... Arthur.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.372
Zelda.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.907
You look lovely.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.842
Oh, right,
you big liar!

19:36.842 --> 19:38.010
Shh!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.345
Arthur

19:39.345 --> 19:40.346
we need to talk.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.814
Don't you think
if you want

19:41.814 --> 19:43.749
to start dating
someone exclusively

19:43.749 --> 19:45.284
you should tell
me about it?

19:45.284 --> 19:47.453
Oh, actually, I was
going to tell you tonight.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.454
Yeah, right.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.356
String her along
while you run around

19:50.356 --> 19:51.624
with that little Lolita

19:51.624 --> 19:54.694
whose picture you keep showing
to every Tom, Dick and Harry!

19:54.694 --> 19:59.732
You mean this picture
of the woman I adore?

20:00.433 --> 20:01.934
Wow. You look great.

20:01.934 --> 20:06.338
You see, I told you
you had nothing to worry about.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.345
I've never seen a person
try to make their own Velcro.

20:13.345 --> 20:15.881
Oh, it's just a little
birthday present insurance

20:15.881 --> 20:18.417
you know, just in case
Morgan doesn't get a job

20:18.417 --> 20:20.086
and I have to buy Josh a vest.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.353
What do you think?

20:21.353 --> 20:23.989
Stuff it with candy
and you've got a pinata.

20:23.989 --> 20:25.357
Well, I did it.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.692
I got a job.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.861
Great. Great.
Oh, that's fantastic.
Congratulations.

20:28.861 --> 20:29.862
Thanks.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.863
It won't be long

20:30.863 --> 20:32.631
before I'll be able
to pay you all back.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.266
Great, because
this birthday present

20:34.266 --> 20:36.168
would have been the end
of my relationship.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.270
So, where will you be working?

20:38.270 --> 20:40.439
In the coffee house...

20:40.439 --> 20:41.774
with you!

20:41.774 --> 20:44.643
We're going to have
so much fun together.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.545
Yeah, it's going
to be great.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.120
Look at her.
It's like she was born

20:54.120 --> 20:56.188
to clear tables
and schlep coffee.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.157
Yeah, I guess that Humble Pie
really did the trick.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.525
You gave her Humble Pie?!

20:59.525 --> 21:00.493
Yeah. Something wrong?

21:00.493 --> 21:01.494
Just a little.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.028
If someone who
eats Humble Pie

21:03.028 --> 21:04.864
runs into someone
who takes the cake

21:04.864 --> 21:06.265
it cancels out everything.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.666
Hi. My name is Morgan

21:07.666 --> 21:10.102
and I'm honored to be
your waitress today.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.504
What can I get for you?

21:11.504 --> 21:12.538
I'll take the cake.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.339
No!

21:13.339 --> 21:14.373
( <i>magical ping</i> )

21:14.373 --> 21:16.041
Get it yourself.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.443
I'm going on break.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.744
See you in three hours.

21:19.178 --> 21:22.515
So, I think the new girl's
really working out.
