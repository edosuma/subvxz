12:23.118 --> 12:26.827
Thank you, General.
Appreciate it.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.119
Will you gentlemen
excuse me for a second?

12:31.209 --> 12:33.200
Sure.
Okay.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.708
Champagne?
Thank you.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.211
Don’t tell me.
You’re sorry you came.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.842
No, not at all.

12:47.768 --> 12:52.888
It is not often that I get to observe
people this powerful in a relaxed situation.

Nah, that was too corny.
Definitely.

13:23.679 --> 13:28.719
I was thinking how
Booth would be bored
at a function like this.

13:28.809 --> 13:32.393
This kind of event
would make Seeley
very nervous.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.812
I don’t mean he’s incapable.
My brother’s very, very capable.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.642
It’sjust— It’s like Seeley’s
afraid ofsuccess.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.524
He stays in his comfort zone.
It drove our dad nuts.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.820
ReaHy?
Maybe that’s what made him
a good sniper.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.402
He doesn’t like to be visible above
the ridgeline, so he keeps his head low.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.909
Instinct.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.334

I cannot help but run that ridge.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.082
Can you give me an example?

14:06.805 --> 14:09.638
I bet you Seeley
never took that risk.

to be Stegman. Why?

there’s something to cash in on?

14:56.730 --> 14:59.938
You know, Bones
never gets in this late.

- Well, I’m here
about the meth lab body.
-OMy

15:28.678 --> 15:34.218
It’s extremely embarrassing for the state
police that this homicide victim...

15:34.309 --> 15:36.675
was blown up
during a training exercise.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.681
Uh-huh.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.684
And the superintendent, the governor,
various movers and shakers,

15:41.775 --> 15:44.391
would look kindly on it ifyou—

15:44.486 --> 15:48.149
ifyou simply neglected to give
that small detail to the press.

15:48.240 --> 15:53.451
And ifthe press digs up that the bodies
were burned and blown into several pieces,

15:53.537 --> 15:56.324
it makes the FBI. look sneaky.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.279

Oh, God. Why am I always
standing precisely
in the wrong place?

16:31.867 --> 16:33.983

16:36.079 --> 16:37.694
Jared Booth.
Good.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.368
Why good?
Because—

16:40.500 --> 16:42.707
Because—
Because he’s Booth’s
little brother.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.706
It would be a creepy way
to have sex with a Booth...

16:45.797 --> 16:47.708
without having sex
with the real Booth.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.836
- Kudos. I would not have had
the guts to say that aloud.
-Jared is a real Booth.

16:50.969 --> 16:54.757
Mmm.
Jared’s Booth—lite.
Booth is the real Booth.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.964

is Booth-lite?

- Only if he drowned after
being shot in the heart.

How did you find him?

17:13.575 --> 17:17.488
The realJim Stegman has DNA. on file
stemming from an assault charge 12 years ago.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.865

and this popped up.

nobody’s been in here

17:34.888 --> 17:37.550
This guy’s gone missing twice
and nobody reports it.

17:37.641 --> 17:41.509
- You sayJim ended up shot
and dumped in the river?
- That’s right. Shot and dumped.

and take a deposit,
then skedaddle.

here in my own town?

18:15.011 --> 18:18.595

he was shot, killed and dumped
in the river a week ago.

18:18.682 --> 18:21.173

four days ago.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.259
After pretending
to beJim Stegman.

killedJim and then committed,

was mar/(ed with a star.

was a little more torque.

and thanks to Clark,
it works.

/came in for the, uh—

19:26.750 --> 19:28.832
The grating you got
from Mike Campbell...

19:28.918 --> 19:32.285
was not the weapon used
to strike Anthony Pongetti
in the face.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.710

19:36.801 --> 19:39.258

a rather malleable
magnesium alloy.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.257
So for it to cause
that much damage—

19:41.348 --> 19:43.714
Yes, it would’ve been
bent from the impact.

19:43.808 --> 19:47.392
Yes. So what we’re looking for
is something heavier.

He was a con man. That’s all.

What did this man
want from us?

to profit off ofyour inventions.

24:50.323 --> 24:54.236
I postulate that each gunshot
was both precise
and deliberate...

24:54.327 --> 24:56.613
and did not occur
in a rapid fire succession.

24:56.704 --> 24:59.116
There’s no way
to tell that from the bones.

24:59.207 --> 25:01.118
No. Not from the bones.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.495
Close-range injuries.

25:03.586 --> 25:07.499
Middle ofthe foot, middle ofthe knee,
middle ofthe shoulder,

25:07.590 --> 25:09.546
dead center on the heart.

25:09.634 --> 25:11.465
Small-caliber weapon.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.463
You believe this was done
on purpose?

25:13.554 --> 25:15.465
Yes. Torture.

25:15.556 --> 25:19.765
- Someone was trying to get
information from this man.
- Pure conjecture, Dr. Edison.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.639
But it has logical integrity.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.898
So, three years ago,
Stegman and Pongetti,
they were arrested.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.854
They were working
some scam together.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.903
But we already knew
they were accomplices.
There was a third guy involved.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.406
They ratted him out.
He went tojail
for five years.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.829
Five-year sentence,
three years with parole.
Is the stool out?

25:41.916 --> 25:44.407
“Is the stool out?” No.
You mean “stoolie.”

25:44.502 --> 25:47.915
And the third guy
wasn’t the stoolie.
Stegman and Pongetti were.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.996
Okay. You go in there.
I’ll be in here.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.884

are you wearing?

25:58.975 --> 26:01.842

They won’t let me
work on Wall Street.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.517

/ ’d make less there.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.936
- What’s this about?
- Stegman and Pongetti.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.854
Parole officer told me
to stay away from them.

26:07.942 --> 26:11.184
But you didn’t stay away
from them, did you, Steve?

26:13.156 --> 26:15.488
Fine. I met with Stegman.

26:15.575 --> 26:20.410
- Why?
- He was making amends,
apologizing in the program.

26:20.496 --> 26:23.784
One small parole violation
and the FBI. gets involved?

26:23.875 --> 26:26.287
Stegman and Pongetti
are both dead.

26:26.377 --> 26:29.710
- You gotta be kidding.
-Shot

26:29.797 --> 26:34.837
it’s okay. You can take a moment to rejoice
in the death of your enemies. Go ahead

26:34.927 --> 26:38.010
Pongetti’s dead—
good. I’m glad.

26:39.015 --> 26:42.132
Stegman, he was okay.

26:42.226 --> 26:45.093
- He ratted you out.
- Pongetti ratted me out.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.474
Stegman backed him is all.

26:47.565 --> 26:50.477
I don’t begrudge.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.401

27:10.087 --> 27:14.126
Do you think he did it?
No. We’ll check his whereabouts,
but you know, I don’t think so.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.708
Nice hat, huh? Come on.
I’ll take you back
to the lab.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.215
What happened
with your RICO bust?

27:19.305 --> 27:21.216
Nothing. Why?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.138
You been talking to Cam?

27:23.226 --> 27:26.138
- No. Did you do something wrong?
- What do you mean?

27:26.229 --> 27:28.140
You didn’t get
the credit you deserve.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.267
- What did you do?
- Life is not always about credit.

27:30.358 --> 27:33.020
That’s not what you said before.
You said life is all about credit.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.897
You were going to Hawaii.
They were gonna put you
on a coin.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.070
Let’sjust forget about it.
Okay, Bones? Forget about it.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.149
Jared warned me that
you tend to sabotage yourself.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.367
Jared said that?
Mm-hmm.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.285
He said that
you’re afraid of success.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.785
Hmm. So, basically,
I’m a loser.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.615
No. He never said
the word “loser.”

27:49.710 --> 27:52.873
Do you think I’m a loser,
like that guy in there—

27:52.964 --> 27:56.548
some clown in some dumb-ass
uniform who can ’t do any better?
is that what you think?

27:56.634 --> 27:59.922
Well, anthropologically, males tend
to rank themselves into a hierarchy.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.799
There ’5 no shame in not being
at the top of the hierarchy.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.802
You’re not answering
the question, Bones.

Your forensic techs got
an ID. for the fingerprint
on the money bag.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.939
- Is it Stegman or Pongetti?
- Stegman.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.240
- But not the one you’re thinking of.
- The son?

28:23.327 --> 28:24.988
No. The wife.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.912
The fingerprint
belongs to Lily Stegman.

28:27.999 --> 28:32.333
Thanks. The fingerprints
belong to Lily Stegman. We know
because she works with kids.

28:32.420 --> 28:35.127
- She acted like she’d
never seen that money before.
- Well, she was lying.

- Can you explain that?

I’m ashamed.

wasJim—

29:07.914 --> 29:10.951
The day after he disappeared,
a package arrived for him.

29:11.042 --> 29:15.581
When he didn’t come back,
I started to think
he meant for us to open it.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.629
- That doesn’t make any sense.
- No, I understand. He’s gone. It’s sitting there.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.503
- Maybe he meant for you to have it.
- Yes.

29:21.594 --> 29:25.382

29:29.977 --> 29:32.810
And... a note.

29:34.690 --> 29:38.148
“Jim, do me a big favor. Hold on to this
until I can get it back from you.

Help yourselfto whatever you need. P.”

29:40.863 --> 29:43.104
P’ Pongetti.

29:43.199 --> 29:46.282
I know I should’ve called
the police. And when you came,
I should’ve told you.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.366
But by then—
You needed the money.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.538
And in a way, you felt like you earned it
for taking that old man in. Family.

29:52.625 --> 29:57.244
My teaching salary
barely pays the bills, and we’re
trying to have another child.

29:57.338 --> 30:00.330
So you were the one that hid the money
in the dust trap thing?

30:00.424 --> 30:02.585
- Yes.
- What does your husband know?

30:02.677 --> 30:04.588
Nothing. I promise.

30:04.679 --> 30:06.715
- She could just be protecting him.
- lam—

30:06.806 --> 30:11.470

about the money you found
or the... rest of it.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.597
- The rest of it?
- There’s more?

30:14.689 --> 30:17.601
Yes. I put it into
our safety deposit box.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.398
Okay. How much?

30:19.485 --> 30:23.023
$1 50,000.

30:27.576 --> 30:32.661
So I figured what happened
is that Pongetti got his cash
in some, you know, illegal way,

30:32.748 --> 30:34.784
maybe in a way that
could get him killed.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.957
Stegman, he’s about
to go visit his son.

30:37.086 --> 30:41.204
So Pongetti sends the cash
to his friend for safety.
Then Stegman gets killed.

30:41.298 --> 30:45.792
So, to go get that cash,
Pongetti decides
to pretend to be Stegman.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.798

irrational decisions.

Okay. I’ll be right there.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.650
Hello.
Dr. Brennan.

31:06.741 --> 31:09.528
I don’t want you to think
this is an intervention.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.529
I don’t know
what that means.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.453
An intervention is when
a group of loved ones
bands together...

31:14.540 --> 31:17.122
to help one oftheir own
make a difficult decision.

31:17.209 --> 31:20.201
Oh. Then—
Then it is an intervention.

31:20.296 --> 31:21.706
Are you my loved ones?

31:21.797 --> 31:25.540
I was troubled by a conversation
I had withJared Booth.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.671
Sweets came to me
with some theories
about Booth’s family life,

31:28.763 --> 31:30.674
and he pretty much nailed it.

31:30.765 --> 31:33.006
Nailed what?
Sit down.

31:38.647 --> 31:44.438
Booth andJared are children
ofa physically abusive, alcoholic father.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.735
Booth ’5 been digging jared out of trouble
since they were kids.

31:46.822 --> 31:50.064
Jared always comes up smelling like a rose,
and Booth takes the hit.

31:50.159 --> 31:52.070
He’s denying his brother
the opportunity...

31:52.161 --> 31:54.698
to take responsibility
and learn from
his own mistakes.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.529
You have no evidence ofthat.

31:56.624 --> 31:59.366
I’ve known the Booth boys
for 15 years.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.202
Now, it’s natural
to be protective
ofa younger sibling.

32:02.296 --> 32:07.086
Of course,Jared is a grown man,
an intelligent, talented,
capable adult.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.633
- I like him very much.
-Yeah?Well, cut it out.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.633
Booth shouldn’t be threatened
by the fact that his brother
is more successful.

32:13.724 --> 32:18.718
I am absolutely certain that
however it is Booth lost all
the credit for that RICO bust,

32:18.813 --> 32:20.724
it’s because ofJared.

32:20.815 --> 32:23.056
We’re all scientists here, right?

32:23.150 --> 32:25.436
Well, not you.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.901
What is
your evidence?
Howabout this?

32:27.988 --> 32:31.731
The last time I told Booth what
I thought ofJared, he didn’t
speak to me for six months.

32:31.826 --> 32:34.363
That is an anecdote.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.320
We’re saying maybe Booth deserves
the benefit ofthe doubt here...

32:37.414 --> 32:39.325
until all the evidence is in.

32:39.416 --> 32:43.034
Evidence.
I am comfortable with evidence.

32:45.673 --> 32:47.584
Okay. Here’s some evidence.

32:47.675 --> 32:50.508
The bullets that killed
both Stegman and Pongetti
were fired from the same gun.

32:50.594 --> 32:53.461
Which suggests they were
killed by the same person.
Thank you.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.714
Should I tell Booth?
No.
I’ll do it.

33:28.716 --> 33:31.958

about Booth losing credit
on the RICO case?

33:32.052 --> 33:35.465
No— What?
I mean, that’s the first
I’ve heard of it.

is that I believed you!

To be honest, I was—
Okay, never mind.
Just never mind, all right?

34:33.572 --> 34:37.941
Agents recovered the rest
ofthe cash from Lily Stegman’s
safety deposit box, right?

34:38.035 --> 34:40.902
The bills were bundled
with evidence bands.

34:41.038 --> 34:44.326
What does that mean?
The money is from the county
sheriff’s headquarters in Bowie.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.666
It was confiscated
during a drug bust.
Oh, 50, drug money.

34:47.753 --> 34:51.245
It was scheduled for transfer
to the Federal Reserve two weeks ago.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.547

Oh, so the fake one
was Pongetti?
Well, it had to be, right?

35:01.892 --> 35:04.759
I mean, geez, he got away
with over 200 grand.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.720

How come no one recognized him?

35:16.657 --> 35:21.902
Why? Because I let that big sheriff know that

35:21.996 --> 35:23.782
Why is that bad?

35:23.872 --> 35:27.535
If he was in it with Pongetti, then he thinks
he knows where the rest ofthe money is.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.038

over to the FBI.

36:32.649 --> 36:37.393
Don’t you know you’re
supposed to talk? Disorient?
Distract the perpetrator?

36:37.488 --> 36:39.274
- Booth?
- Not now, Bones.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.151
- You want me to try and shoot him?
- No.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.948
- Why? I’m a good shot.
- You are not a good shot.

36:44.036 --> 36:47.824
Well, you are. Maybe ifwe switched weapons,
you could hit him right between the eyes.

36:47.915 --> 36:50.201
- [Gunshot]
- [ Groans]
- Bones!

36:50.292 --> 36:53.079
- [Engine Starts]
- Bones, are you okay? Bones!

36:53.170 --> 36:55.877
I’m okay!

36:55.964 --> 36:57.955
[Screams]

37:07.726 --> 37:10.638
Lilyl
I’m okay

37:21.949 --> 37:25.316
Are you okay?
Huh?
I’m okay.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.983
,/‘,/‘ [Man Singing Rock, indistinct ]

38:00.070 --> 38:05.531
I would like to propose
a toast to my partner,
Seeley Booth.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.570
To Booth.
To Booth.
Cheers!

38:07.661 --> 38:09.572
I know who he is,

38:09.663 --> 38:12.200
but I forget sometimes
because—

38:13.834 --> 38:16.826
because he never
shines a light on himself.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.831
He shines it
on other people.

38:18.922 --> 38:21.459
Yeah. Right after I conked ‘em
on the head with it.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.007
[All Chuckling]

38:24.094 --> 38:29.839
Anthropology teaches us
that the alpha male
is the man wearing the crown,

38:29.933 --> 38:34.973
displaying
the most colorful plumage
and the shiniest baubles.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.600
He stands out
from the others.

38:37.691 --> 38:41.900
But I now think that anthropology
may have it wrong.

38:43.030 --> 38:47.899
In working with Booth,
I’ve come to realize...

38:47.993 --> 38:52.487
that the quiet man,
the invisible man,

38:52.581 --> 38:57.792
the man who is always there
for friends and family—

39:00.005 --> 39:02.587
that’s the real alpha male.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.045
And I promise...

39:06.136 --> 39:09.378
that my eyes will never
be caught by those...

39:09.473 --> 39:12.089
shiny baubles again.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.885
Happy birthday, Booth.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.357
- Happy birthday, Booth.
- Happy birthday.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.432
Thanks, Bones.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.813
[Booth]
Thank you.

39:23.904 --> 39:25.940
Uh, Bones. All right,
what are we doing?

39:26.073 --> 39:28.280
Come here.
What?

39:28.367 --> 39:30.528
Just come here
for a second.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.947
What you are doing
for your brother isn’t fair.

39:37.042 --> 39:41.126
Don’t get me mad at you
after that great speech.
Not after I got you shot.

39:41.213 --> 39:44.000
You didn’t get me shot.
I got me shot.

39:44.132 --> 39:47.750
I don’t want to talk
about my brother.
Would you prefer Sweets do it?

39:52.558 --> 39:54.469
I’m listening.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.471
Well, I forgot all
the psychological stuff,

39:56.562 --> 39:59.474
but basically, when you
rescue somebody all the time,

39:59.565 --> 40:01.726
ifyou keep getting
them out on bail—

40:01.817 --> 40:05.560
“Bail them out,” Bones.
Ifyou “bail them out”—

40:05.654 --> 40:08.691
You’re thwarting their ability
to help themselves.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.569
- [ Grumbles]
- Now you’re angry.

40:11.660 --> 40:14.367
Bones, you have to admit,
getting a psychological
lesson from you is like—

40:14.454 --> 40:21.576
Getting an anthropology
lesson from you?

40:21.670 --> 40:23.581
The RICO case.

40:23.672 --> 40:27.961
I traded my one shot at glory to keep
my brother from being arrested...

40:32.055 --> 40:34.091
for drunk driving.

40:34.182 --> 40:38.926
Booth, you know,
what if he does it again?

40:39.021 --> 40:42.479
What if he kills someone
next time? You shouldn’t
have done that.

40:42.566 --> 40:48.232
Right... says the woman who
got her father off murder charges.

40:50.991 --> 40:53.198
[Sighs]

40:54.286 --> 40:56.277
Faceit

40:56.371 --> 40:58.407
We do things for family.

40:58.498 --> 41:01.535
You’re right.
You’re totally right.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.081
No, I’m not.
What? Why?

41:09.176 --> 41:12.339
There’s no risk that
your father will kill again.

41:15.015 --> 41:17.006
Jared.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.265
You, uh, bringing me out here
to give me advice on your partner?

41:26.401 --> 41:30.144
Because I think
that ship has sailed.
No, no.

41:30.238 --> 41:33.776
What I gotta do here is,
I, uh—

41:33.867 --> 41:36.358
I gotta stop.
Do you understand?

41:37.412 --> 41:39.027
Stop?
Yeah.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.329
And you should stop too.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.498
I gotta stop what?

41:43.585 --> 41:45.826
The drinking. Stop it.

41:45.921 --> 41:47.832
[Chuckles]

41:47.923 --> 41:50.335
I’ll take that under advisement.
[Laughs]

41:50.425 --> 41:52.882
I’m serious,Jared.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.761
No more stepping in
to make things go away.

41:57.933 --> 42:00.470
I carry my own water, Seeley.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.893
Now you should go back inside
and enjoy your birthday party.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.971
Right.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.603
Cheers.
Yeah.

42:09.695 --> 42:12.107
Happy birthday to me.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.372
Hey.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.875
You gonna come back in
for cake?

42:30.966 --> 42:33.002
Bones, Ijust
need some time.

42:33.093 --> 42:36.085
Do you need time and space?

42:37.472 --> 42:39.463
Just some time.

42:59.161 --> 43:01.152
My dad drank.

43:52.547 --> 43:53.923
What’s that mean?
