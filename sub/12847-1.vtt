18:02.601 --> 18:03.667
Why?

18:03.669 --> 18:06.335
You can stop by my studio
and get some supplies.

18:06.337 --> 18:08.304
For what?

18:08.306 --> 18:10.106
You need a wedding dress,
don't you?

18:10.108 --> 18:11.942
Molly...

18:11.944 --> 18:14.210
you're already
doing so much.

18:14.212 --> 18:17.547
Ah, I've been meaning
to expand my repertoire anyway.

18:20.351 --> 18:21.350
Don't you have to work

18:21.352 --> 18:23.920
on your designs
for the winter line?

18:23.922 --> 18:26.957
Um, still waiting
for inspiration

18:26.959 --> 18:28.124
to come on those.

18:28.126 --> 18:30.827
Right now,
I'm all about weddings.

18:30.829 --> 18:32.796
Thank you.

18:32.798 --> 18:34.097
Thank you so much.

18:35.467 --> 18:37.934
I guess we should
head back?

18:37.936 --> 18:39.335
See you tomorrow.

18:39.337 --> 18:40.303
-Okay.
-Good luck.

18:41.306 --> 18:42.672
Not a scratch
on my car, okay?

18:42.674 --> 18:44.674
Drive safe.

18:46.845 --> 18:49.178
[♪♪♪]

18:54.219 --> 18:56.920
This isn't, like,
a more elaborate version

18:56.922 --> 18:59.623
of locking us
on the balcony, is it?

19:01.493 --> 19:03.660
[laughing]

19:12.786 --> 19:15.252
[♪♪♪]

19:19.893 --> 19:21.960
[microwave beeps]

19:29.736 --> 19:31.135
What are those?

19:31.137 --> 19:32.971
Dinner.

19:32.973 --> 19:34.706
Gross.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.707
You want some?

19:35.709 --> 19:36.841
Totally.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.743
Pizza bites! Mm.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.978
Ugh. I'm not
eating that.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.579
I'm gonna make
something else.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.549
Suit yourself.
I'm going upstairs.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.053
We'll figure it out
one of these days.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.656
Don't wait too long.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.025
Dads don't last forever.

19:54.027 --> 19:57.228
I lost my folks
too early.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.398
I'm sorry
to hear that.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.171
What are you making?

20:07.173 --> 20:08.472
Chili.

20:08.474 --> 20:09.541
It's the best
I could do

20:09.543 --> 20:10.775
until I can get
to a market.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.511
Luckily,
my mom taught me

20:13.513 --> 20:15.747
how to improvise
in the kitchen.

20:15.749 --> 20:17.181
She used to be
able to make

20:17.183 --> 20:18.182
the most amazing things

20:18.184 --> 20:19.717
outta absolutely
nothing at all.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.687
I would've given anything
to have a mom like that.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.721
Your mom didn't cook?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.289
Can you give me the salt?

20:25.291 --> 20:27.659
Yeah, well, she did,

20:27.661 --> 20:29.493
but all she made
my entire childhood

20:29.495 --> 20:31.062
was diet food.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.329
My therapist said
she was trying

20:32.331 --> 20:35.232
to spare me the pain of being
a chunky kid like she was,

20:35.234 --> 20:37.001
but there wasn't a day

20:37.003 --> 20:38.970
that I wasn't hungry
for something real.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.337
Uh-uh-uh! No.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.472
Sorry.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.307
That would explain
your fondness for comfort food.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.776
What about your dad?

20:44.778 --> 20:45.843
He was smart.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.445
He stayed out with his buddies
for dinner

20:47.447 --> 20:48.947
most of the time.

20:48.949 --> 20:51.148
When he was home,
all they did was fight.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.984
You know, I never once
saw them

20:52.986 --> 20:54.852
hold hands or kiss,

20:54.854 --> 20:57.655
or even hug each other.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.356
That's probably for the best.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.759
How can you say that?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.963
Can you get me the, uh,
spicy chili oil, please?

21:06.066 --> 21:07.231
Um...

21:07.233 --> 21:10.735
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
No, this one.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.137
Oh, hey, um, what were you
thinking for the hors d'oeuvres?

21:13.139 --> 21:16.107
Uh... I don't know,
I'm not sure.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.541
Hey.

21:17.543 --> 21:21.713
Maybe we could make
some dishes for the wedding

21:21.715 --> 21:23.047
from your mom's recipes.

21:23.049 --> 21:26.383
I mean, didn't she cook for
big groups of people every day

21:26.385 --> 21:28.953
when the inn was open?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.888
No, no, no, no.
Not-- Not those.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.790
I...

21:32.792 --> 21:34.626
I can't cook my mom's recipes.

21:34.628 --> 21:37.495
I mean, I can
cook my mom's recipes,

21:37.497 --> 21:39.463
I just I... I don't.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.566
We might be the worst
two people in history--

21:42.568 --> 21:43.935
[Overlapping]:
...To plan a wedding.

21:43.937 --> 21:45.136
Yeah.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.204
Yeah, you might
be right.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.607
[Charlie]:
Got your room ready.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.447
I love it.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.116
Yeah.

21:58.118 --> 22:00.217
Sheets are pretty good.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.653
Clarissa was always
going on and on

22:01.655 --> 22:03.587
about thread counts,

22:03.589 --> 22:05.089
pillow tops,
and all that.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.959
I never cared about
that stuff.

22:07.961 --> 22:10.327
I had what I needed.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.395
Charlie...

22:11.397 --> 22:12.429
What?

22:12.431 --> 22:13.497
Are you sure you're okay

22:13.499 --> 22:15.399
with us fixing up the place
for the wedding?

22:15.401 --> 22:16.968
Why wouldn't I be?

22:16.970 --> 22:19.037
Well, it's just...

22:19.039 --> 22:22.907
I'm sure every room
holds a lot of memories for you.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.910
Just leave the kitchen
the way it is.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.244
That's all I ask.

22:27.246 --> 22:29.280
I will.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.382
Yeah. Bathroom's down
the end of the hall,

22:31.384 --> 22:32.383
on the left.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.384
You're the only one using it.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.186
Nick's room
is on the opposite end.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.921
Charlie?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.156
Hmm?

22:39.759 --> 22:42.226

22:49.635 --> 22:51.703

23:56.936 --> 23:58.469
Snoop much?

23:58.471 --> 24:01.172
Sorry. I thought
this was the bathroom.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.707
This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.309
Well, it's just

24:05.311 --> 24:07.044
a bunch of stupid
ol' recipes

24:07.046 --> 24:09.013
that I made up
as a kid.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.347
[chuckles]

24:10.349 --> 24:13.151
Okay. Cookies,
sugar balls...

24:13.153 --> 24:14.218
Sugar balls?

24:14.220 --> 24:15.653
Yeah.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.221
Stick of butter rolled into
a ball, and dipped in sugar.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.322
Did you eat that?

24:18.324 --> 24:19.323
Yes, I did...

24:19.325 --> 24:20.624
Once.

24:20.626 --> 24:21.926
[laughs]

24:21.928 --> 24:23.194
Mm!

24:23.196 --> 24:26.764
Can you make me "Nick's
Famuss Chocklit-Chip Cookies?"

24:26.766 --> 24:27.899
No. No way.

24:27.901 --> 24:30.434
Oh! Why not?

24:30.436 --> 24:31.869
You got the tools
here and everything.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.939
Because the main ingredient...
is chicken.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.874
No, it's not.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.012
I'm gonna go ahead
and cancel that order.

24:41.014 --> 24:43.447
Good idea.
Uh, actually,

24:43.449 --> 24:45.683
if you're interested
in cookies,

24:45.685 --> 24:47.985
you might want...

24:47.987 --> 24:49.620
to try these.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.522
Mm. Those look delicious.

24:51.524 --> 24:52.523
They are delicious,

24:52.525 --> 24:53.724
and you can barely taste
the chicken, so...

24:53.726 --> 24:55.459
[chuckling]

24:57.363 --> 25:01.165
That there
is my first spatula.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.301
Really?

25:03.303 --> 25:05.369
Yeah. Learned to cook
with that.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.371
And it's hidden away
up here?

25:07.373 --> 25:09.140
It should be
on display somewhere.

25:09.142 --> 25:10.975
Like a ballplayer's
first glove.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.676
Oh, come on.
I'm hardly Derek Jeter.

25:12.678 --> 25:15.346
It's just a...
you know, it's a spatula.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.182
That's why you've held
onto it all these years?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.289
Let it inspire you.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.993
Mm-hmm. Okay.

Well...

25:33.366 --> 25:34.765
[sets book down]

25:34.767 --> 25:35.766
I should probably go.

25:35.768 --> 25:36.800
Yeah. Of course.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.704
Uh...

25:40.706 --> 25:41.906
Second door on the left.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.243
Uh, the other left.

25:45.245 --> 25:46.244
Yeah.

25:46.246 --> 25:47.245
There you go.

-'Night!
-'Night.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.925
Anyone?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.963
Wow.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.865
Somebody went shopping.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.078
[Nick]: Hey, Snoopy.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.414
Oh. Hi.

26:56.416 --> 26:59.450
I see you made my mom's
"Country Baked Omelette".

26:59.452 --> 27:02.086
-Hope that's okay.
-Yeah.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.988
I figured
I could probably make it

27:03.990 --> 27:05.256
without messing it up too much.

27:05.258 --> 27:07.458
Well, it smells
exactly the same.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.860
Do you want to try it?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.398
I'll try it and see.

27:24.177 --> 27:25.642
Oh, no! It's terrible,
isn't it?

27:26.679 --> 27:28.745
It's exactly
how I remembered it.

27:37.309 --> 27:38.374
[footsteps]

27:38.376 --> 27:40.010
Hey, so I talked
to my guy in New York

27:40.012 --> 27:42.412
and the food'll be here
in a couple days.

27:42.414 --> 27:43.413
That's great.

27:43.415 --> 27:44.380
Yeah.

27:44.382 --> 27:45.548
Can I show you
what I've been working on?

27:46.551 --> 27:47.583
Sure.

27:47.585 --> 27:50.320
All right.

27:50.322 --> 27:53.190
"Upscale Vintage Farmhouse."

27:53.192 --> 27:54.191
You see?

27:55.360 --> 27:58.295
It's classy... yet comfortable.

28:00.732 --> 28:02.199
What's wrong with it?

28:02.201 --> 28:03.366
It's perfect.

28:03.368 --> 28:06.402
Actually, I was thinking
that we would modernize the inn.

28:06.404 --> 28:07.637
You know, bring in

28:07.639 --> 28:10.006
some more metal
and glass,

28:10.008 --> 28:11.141
maybe some stone...

28:11.143 --> 28:13.443
That would ruin the whole vibe
of the place.

28:13.445 --> 28:14.577
No, no, no, no, no.
It'd be calming.

28:14.579 --> 28:16.880
It'd be more refined.
Minimalist.

28:16.882 --> 28:18.248
"Less is more,"
you know?

28:18.250 --> 28:21.417
So basically, "One Quail Egg
on a Plate: The Hotel"?

28:21.419 --> 28:24.120
If the egg is done right,
then yes.

28:24.122 --> 28:25.121
That is what I do.

28:25.123 --> 28:26.156
Okay,
how about this?

28:26.158 --> 28:27.390
You go work
on your idea,

28:27.392 --> 28:28.424
I'll work on mine,

28:28.426 --> 28:30.026
and we'll let
Amy and James decide

28:30.028 --> 28:32.162
if they want
a quail egg

28:32.164 --> 28:33.263
or a lobster roll.

We were just about to leave
and the lawyers called us back.

There's more going on
than we realized,

29:02.895 --> 29:04.727

It's okay, Amy,
don't worry about it.

Stay there and take care of her.
We've got this covered.

29:09.368 --> 29:11.368
But we haven't
picked a style yet.

29:11.370 --> 29:13.403
Well, you can do it from there.

29:13.405 --> 29:14.905
So you get
the idea, right?

29:14.907 --> 29:16.572

My menu concept doesn't
really gel with that.

29:31.756 --> 29:34.157
I was picturing a version
of what I do in the city.

29:34.159 --> 29:35.458
Simple, clean, elegant.

29:35.460 --> 29:36.826
I said "elegant" first.

29:36.828 --> 29:38.328
And I think that
we should incorporate

29:38.330 --> 29:39.396
those modern elements

29:39.398 --> 29:41.631
into the style
of the wedding itself.

29:41.633 --> 29:43.633
He has a point.

29:43.635 --> 29:46.036
I don't know,
what do you think?

29:46.038 --> 29:47.337
You decide.

29:47.339 --> 29:49.172
It's your special day.

29:49.174 --> 29:50.373
<i>Isn't it yours, too?</i>

29:50.375 --> 29:52.008
<i>Of course, but...</i>

29:52.010 --> 29:53.176
I'd be fine getting
married by Elvis

29:53.178 --> 29:54.377
at a drive-thru.

29:54.379 --> 29:56.046
[laughs]

29:56.048 --> 29:57.580
[phone chimes]

29:57.582 --> 29:58.949
It's my dad.

29:58.951 --> 30:00.150
<i>I really have</i>
<i>to talk to him.</i>

30:00.152 --> 30:02.085
That's fine, just tell us
which style you like.

30:02.087 --> 30:03.853
<i>What about both?</i>

30:03.855 --> 30:05.288
B... [scoffs] Both?

30:05.290 --> 30:06.289
[words catching]

30:06.291 --> 30:07.290
How are we supposed
to do that?

30:07.292 --> 30:09.092
<i>I'm really sorry,</i>
<i>Molly, I have to go.</i>

30:09.094 --> 30:11.861
<i>I know whatever you do,</i>
<i>it'll be amazing.</i>

30:11.863 --> 30:13.296
[chat-end alert chimes]

30:13.298 --> 30:14.797
[weary sighing]

30:15.800 --> 30:17.700
Now what do we do?

30:17.702 --> 30:19.102
Well, you heard the bride.
She wants both.

30:19.104 --> 30:21.604
"Minimalist Modern
Vintage Farmhouse"?

30:21.606 --> 30:22.839
That's not even
a real thing.

30:22.841 --> 30:24.274
Yeah. I know.
I was joking.

30:24.276 --> 30:26.843
But, clearly, she
liked mine better, so...

30:26.845 --> 30:27.844
[scoffs] No.

30:27.846 --> 30:29.879
Amy said she loved mine.
Okay? I heard her.

30:29.881 --> 30:33.116
[chuckles]

30:34.786 --> 30:35.952
Unless...

30:35.954 --> 30:37.720
What?

30:39.157 --> 30:42.025
Unless we really
can do both.

30:42.027 --> 30:44.327
[♪♪♪]

30:58.477 --> 30:59.942
You wanna see it?

31:01.146 --> 31:02.145
Yeah. Sure.

31:06.284 --> 31:08.284
Okay...

31:08.286 --> 31:11.821
So, the vintage
farmhouse lanterns set the tone,

31:11.823 --> 31:15.525
but the blue palette
will modernize the look,

31:15.527 --> 31:17.960
even the candles change...

31:19.331 --> 31:21.631
"Country meets city."

31:21.633 --> 31:23.900
Timeless and trendy...

31:23.902 --> 31:25.468
all at the same time.

31:25.470 --> 31:28.971
Well, I have to admit...
it's pretty cool.

31:33.845 --> 31:35.278
Why aren't you saying anything?

31:35.280 --> 31:37.347
I was expecting you
to say you were joking.

31:37.349 --> 31:41.084
No. No, I'm not joking.

31:41.086 --> 31:43.086
I think this can work.

31:46.691 --> 31:48.891
[♪♪♪]

31:48.893 --> 31:51.861
[nervous overlapping chatter]

31:51.863 --> 31:53.063
All right.
We need supplies.

31:57.135 --> 32:00.103
[Nick]: I don't know, for me,
I like the cool-tone whites.

32:00.105 --> 32:01.671
I actually like
the warm yellows.

32:01.673 --> 32:03.173
We want people
to feel like

32:03.175 --> 32:04.474
they can take
their shoes off.

32:04.476 --> 32:06.209
Ugh... there's nothing worse

32:06.211 --> 32:08.578
than women taking
their shoes off at a wedding.

32:08.580 --> 32:09.879
So tacky.

32:09.881 --> 32:11.481
Try wearing heels
for five minutes

32:11.483 --> 32:12.515
and then see how you feel.

32:12.517 --> 32:13.716
Well, all I'm saying

32:13.718 --> 32:15.751
is that you spend hours
getting ready for the wedding,

32:15.753 --> 32:17.420
and the second
the conga line breaks out,

32:17.422 --> 32:19.622
you all turn into
a bunch of hillbillies.

32:19.624 --> 32:20.790
I feel like you have

32:20.792 --> 32:22.758
some deep-seated issues
with feet.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.026
No, no, no, no, I just, uh...

32:24.028 --> 32:26.296
I like things to be
more refined, you know?

32:26.298 --> 32:27.797
And I don't?

32:27.799 --> 32:28.798
No, you don't.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.932
You like things
to be more comfy.

32:29.934 --> 32:31.968
What's wrong with comfy?

32:31.970 --> 32:33.403
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong with comfy.

32:33.405 --> 32:34.837
Just not all the time.

32:34.839 --> 32:36.506
If you grew up in a house

32:36.508 --> 32:39.809
where everything was white,
spotless, and off-limits,

32:39.811 --> 32:43.379
you'd see why I value comfort
above all else.

32:44.716 --> 32:46.483
It's okay to relax sometimes,
you know?

32:46.485 --> 32:47.450
Uh-huh.

32:50.054 --> 32:52.122
Do you realize that
you never sit down?

32:52.124 --> 32:54.524
I can rest when
I'm dead, right?

32:54.526 --> 32:56.292
You know what?

32:57.362 --> 32:59.061
I'm going to teach you
how to relax.

33:00.064 --> 33:01.063
No, thank you.

33:01.065 --> 33:03.966
Challenge accepted.

33:05.303 --> 33:06.936
Huh.

33:08.373 --> 33:09.606
Ooh!

33:09.608 --> 33:12.175
Look at these remnants.

33:12.177 --> 33:13.576
Dirt-cheap...

33:13.578 --> 33:15.044
and fabulous.

33:15.046 --> 33:17.813
Is this the wedding version
of Maria von Trapp

33:17.815 --> 33:19.882
using old curtains
to make playclothes?

33:19.884 --> 33:22.152
Yes! You know that movie?

33:23.255 --> 33:25.488
What, a guy can't
enjoy a good musical?

33:25.490 --> 33:28.424
Yeah, I just didn't
think that guy was you.

33:28.426 --> 33:31.127
It was my mom's
favorite movie.

33:31.129 --> 33:32.962
Used to watch it
every year.

33:32.964 --> 33:35.031
Mine, too!

33:35.033 --> 33:37.333
You're not gonna burst
into song, though, are you?

33:37.335 --> 33:38.334
[huffs unconvincingly]

33:38.336 --> 33:40.270
No.

33:41.339 --> 33:42.272
Yeah, you were.

33:43.642 --> 33:45.608
[Nick chuckles]

33:47.279 --> 33:51.548
Oh, I can totally
re-purpose this for Amy's dress!

33:51.550 --> 33:52.715
It's gorgeous.

33:52.717 --> 33:54.417
Yeah, it's nice.
You know,

33:54.419 --> 33:56.452
I betcha five bucks
this whole place

33:56.454 --> 33:57.753
and everything in it
is haunted.

33:57.755 --> 34:00.122
[chuckles]
Nothing's haunted.

34:00.124 --> 34:03.759
Oh. Except this box.

34:03.761 --> 34:05.828
There's definitely
a ghost in there.

34:05.830 --> 34:07.797
Oh, yeah? [gasps]

34:07.799 --> 34:08.797
[high voice]: Help me!

34:08.800 --> 34:10.632
I'm trapped inside
this antique store

34:10.635 --> 34:11.801
and I can't get out!

34:11.803 --> 34:12.802
[laughing]

34:12.804 --> 34:14.704
Nick! Is that you?

34:14.706 --> 34:16.438
Henry! Hey.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.674
How're you doing?
Good to see you!

34:17.676 --> 34:18.908
Uh, Henry, this is Molly.

34:18.909 --> 34:20.210
Very pleased to meet you.

34:20.212 --> 34:21.344
Hi!

34:21.346 --> 34:23.346
Wow, it's-- it's been ages.

34:23.348 --> 34:24.480
Yeah.

34:24.482 --> 34:25.681
So what brings you
back in these parts?

34:25.684 --> 34:28.618
Well, actually,
we are planning a wedding.

34:28.620 --> 34:29.851
[chuckling]

34:29.853 --> 34:31.621
Oh, I could tell.

34:31.623 --> 34:34.123
You two have
that certain something.

34:34.125 --> 34:36.458
Reminds me so much
of your parents when--

34:36.460 --> 34:37.659
We're not the ones
who are getting married.

34:37.661 --> 34:38.728
Oh?

34:38.730 --> 34:40.029
Yeah, we're helping
our best friends

34:40.031 --> 34:41.197
plan theirs.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.398
Yeah, we barely
know each other.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.033
We're practically
strangers.

34:44.034 --> 34:45.201
Yeah.

34:45.203 --> 34:47.402
[simultaneously]:
Ooh! That's cool!

34:49.040 --> 34:51.306
[♪♪♪]

34:51.309 --> 34:53.976
I don't believe it.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.580
[♪♪♪]

35:04.456 --> 35:05.921
No way!

35:05.923 --> 35:09.292
Gus! Tony!
Great to see you guys!

35:09.294 --> 35:11.294
Hey, this is
a friend of mine, Molly.

35:11.296 --> 35:12.962
-Molly, Tony and Gus.
-Hey.

35:12.964 --> 35:14.230
What are you guys doing here?

35:14.232 --> 35:16.266
We're here to help
whip this place into shape.

35:16.268 --> 35:17.900
Well, how did
you know?

35:17.902 --> 35:19.702
Your dad called.

35:19.704 --> 35:22.171
Really? He did?

35:22.173 --> 35:23.339
So what do you want done?

35:23.341 --> 35:24.340
Well, uh...

35:24.342 --> 35:25.941
budget's a little thin
on this one, guys.

35:25.943 --> 35:27.042
This is <i>gratis.</i>

35:27.044 --> 35:28.278
Your pop
called in a favor.

35:29.681 --> 35:30.680
You got paint?

35:30.682 --> 35:32.014
Yeah, in the back of
Charlie's truck.

35:34.552 --> 35:36.419
Seems like your dad's
really trying.

35:36.421 --> 35:38.154
Well, he called
a couple of friends,

35:38.156 --> 35:39.689
but he can still
barely talk to me.

35:39.691 --> 35:41.824
[quietly]:
Nicky, give your pop a break.

35:41.826 --> 35:43.726
He did the best he could.

35:44.763 --> 35:47.330
[♪♪♪]

35:52.852 --> 35:55.319
[♪♪♪]

35:56.322 --> 35:57.321
[Molly]:
"Salmon roe parfait"?

35:57.323 --> 35:58.322
[Nick]: Yeah!

35:58.324 --> 35:59.356
Oh, come on!

35:59.358 --> 36:00.658
We need to have
something on the menu

36:00.660 --> 36:01.959
that isn't...<i>nouveau.</i>

36:01.961 --> 36:03.928
You need to realize
the three main food groups

36:03.930 --> 36:06.397
aren't cheese, bacon,
and ranch dressing.

36:06.399 --> 36:08.232
Ah. But they're
the best food groups.

36:08.234 --> 36:09.233
[grumbles] Ah. Come on.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.200
We got to do
something better.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.502
Amy and James,

36:11.504 --> 36:12.904
they want something
more artful.

36:12.906 --> 36:14.171
-"Art"?
-Yes!

36:14.173 --> 36:15.472
Come on!
People want to eat.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.608
No, they want
an <i>experience.</i>

36:17.610 --> 36:20.578
How about the experience
of feeling full?

36:20.580 --> 36:22.146
Leaving people
full is easy.

36:22.148 --> 36:23.247
Anyone can do that.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.248
Leaving them satisfied,

36:24.250 --> 36:27.151
that means
engaging their senses,

36:27.153 --> 36:28.218
taking 'em on a journey,

36:28.220 --> 36:29.253
and that's gotta have

36:29.255 --> 36:31.422
sight, smell,
taste, everything.

36:31.424 --> 36:33.123
I got it.

36:33.125 --> 36:34.091
Okay.

36:34.093 --> 36:35.593
Chicken pot pie.

36:36.663 --> 36:39.697
Really? Did you hear anything
that I just said?

36:39.699 --> 36:41.131
Everybody loves
chicken pot pie!

36:43.502 --> 36:45.069
Wait a second...

36:46.372 --> 36:47.905
What if...

36:47.907 --> 36:49.306
What?

36:49.308 --> 36:50.975
What if we did both?

36:51.978 --> 36:55.046
[♪♪♪]

37:08.861 --> 37:10.661
Hot, hot, hot.

37:10.663 --> 37:12.029
Okay...

37:12.031 --> 37:13.998
Chicken pot pie--

37:14.000 --> 37:15.232
Nick Turner-style.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.801
It's got...

37:16.803 --> 37:17.902
cremini mushrooms,

37:17.904 --> 37:18.869
fresh leeks,

37:18.871 --> 37:20.571
roasted heirloom
garden vegetables,

37:20.573 --> 37:23.074
uh, hickory-smoked
organic chicken,

37:23.076 --> 37:25.943
and a rosemary-infused
biscuit crust.

37:25.945 --> 37:27.812
Sounds complex.

37:27.814 --> 37:30.014
Yeah, it-- [stammers]
Would you just try it? Come on.

37:33.486 --> 37:36.520
[♪♪♪]

37:43.562 --> 37:44.629
You hate it.

37:46.766 --> 37:47.965
This is literally

37:47.967 --> 37:49.867
the best thing
I've ever tasted.

37:51.604 --> 37:52.603
Seriously.

37:52.605 --> 37:56.140
Wow. Means a lot,
coming from you, thank you.

37:56.142 --> 37:57.374
You know what this is?

37:58.511 --> 38:01.612
This is the perfect compromise
for the wedding menu.

38:02.749 --> 38:04.782
It's Clarissa's comfort food...

38:04.784 --> 38:06.550
with a Nick Turner twist.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.120
I really want to
argue with you,

38:09.122 --> 38:10.354
but I think you're right.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.289
[laughs]
We could do pasta--

38:12.291 --> 38:14.058
Homemade pasta, with...

38:14.060 --> 38:15.626
butter-poached prawns,

38:15.628 --> 38:16.961
mustard greens,

38:16.963 --> 38:18.228
and hickory-smoked bacon.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.363
Fried chicken.

38:19.365 --> 38:22.399
With a Sriracha brine,
served on peashoots,

38:22.401 --> 38:23.567
and roasted
carrot purée.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.535
Meatloaf?

38:24.537 --> 38:25.536
<i>Veal</i> meatloaf,

38:25.538 --> 38:27.237
served with...
sweet tomato confit.

38:27.239 --> 38:28.873
And baked potatoes?

38:28.875 --> 38:30.440
Sweet potato...<i>gnocchi</i>

38:30.442 --> 38:32.877
served with kale
and arugula pesto.

38:32.879 --> 38:34.945
That sounds perfect! Oh!

38:37.950 --> 38:39.150
[both laughing]

38:39.152 --> 38:40.885
What about the wedding cake?

38:40.887 --> 38:44.121
I have a recipe for that,
upstairs, in my book.

38:44.123 --> 38:45.289
What's in it?

38:45.291 --> 38:46.290
Chicken.

38:46.292 --> 38:47.591
I'll call a bakery.

38:47.593 --> 38:48.726
Yeah. Good idea.

38:48.728 --> 38:50.695
Okay.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.934
[♪♪♪]

38:59.505 --> 39:00.738
[mock sobbing]

we can buy a house
anywhere in the country

52:24.195 --> 52:25.794
and not have to worry
about money for a while.

52:25.796 --> 52:26.929
I would rather
be broke

52:26.931 --> 52:28.364
than live
outside of Manhattan.

52:28.366 --> 52:29.331
Seems you're well on your way.

52:32.403 --> 52:34.336
Hi! We got the stuff.

52:34.338 --> 52:36.238
[Molly]: Great.
Can't wait to get started.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.306
[door slams]

52:37.308 --> 52:39.041
You guys okay?

52:39.043 --> 52:40.809
Yeah. We're fine.

52:40.811 --> 52:43.745
Just happy to be back here,
ready to help.

52:43.747 --> 52:44.880
Right?

52:44.882 --> 52:45.981
Of course!

52:48.752 --> 52:50.119
Where do we start?

52:51.488 --> 52:53.055
How are you with a mop?

53:00.337 --> 53:02.470
[♪♪♪]

53:04.274 --> 53:05.907
You missed a spot, Gus.

53:08.445 --> 53:10.478
I know it's hard
to visualize now,

53:10.480 --> 53:11.646
but once we get
it all cleaned up,

53:11.648 --> 53:13.348
it'll start
falling into place.

53:13.350 --> 53:15.716
I'm sure
it's gonna be great.

53:15.718 --> 53:17.218
What?

53:17.220 --> 53:18.219
[chuckling]

53:18.221 --> 53:20.288
I am cleaning mouse droppings
off the floor

53:20.290 --> 53:21.823
of my wedding venue.

53:21.825 --> 53:23.891
I know it's not what
you dreamed of, Ames,

53:23.893 --> 53:26.527
but your wedding
will still be beautiful.

53:26.529 --> 53:27.495
It's not the wedding.

53:27.497 --> 53:28.729
It's just,
before all this happened,

53:28.731 --> 53:32.267
I thought I knew exactly
how my life was supposed to be,

53:32.269 --> 53:33.801
and now I can't see it.

53:33.803 --> 53:34.802
Have you
talked to James?

53:34.804 --> 53:35.803
I tried,

53:35.805 --> 53:36.838
but he doesn't
understand.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.706
He thinks it's some kind
of a reality check,

53:38.708 --> 53:40.408
like this is supposed
to be good for us.

53:40.410 --> 53:43.678
Well, maybe in the end,
it'll bring you closer.

53:43.680 --> 53:46.014
You have each other.

53:46.016 --> 53:47.782
And you also have me!

53:47.784 --> 53:51.652
24-7, on duty from now
until you walk down that aisle.

53:55.425 --> 53:56.424
What?

53:56.426 --> 53:59.094
You look so happy.

54:00.097 --> 54:03.598
I thought you and Nick would've
killed each other by now.

54:05.935 --> 54:07.402
No way. [Gasping]

54:07.404 --> 54:08.870
Molly!

54:08.872 --> 54:09.937
Do you like Nick?

54:09.939 --> 54:10.938
No!

54:10.940 --> 54:12.507
Because that would
be amazing!

54:12.509 --> 54:14.342
We could be
"married couple BFFs."

54:14.344 --> 54:15.977
We could live
in the same neighborhood.

54:15.979 --> 54:18.279
Our kids could be
best friends!

54:18.281 --> 54:19.247
Amy, stop it!

54:19.249 --> 54:20.815
There's nothing
going on.

54:20.817 --> 54:22.317
-Are you sure?
-Yes. I'm sure.

54:22.319 --> 54:23.385
It's impossible.

54:23.387 --> 54:25.420
Neither of us wants
anything to do with love.

54:26.456 --> 54:28.789
Who said anything
about love?

54:30.093 --> 54:31.159
You did.

54:31.161 --> 54:32.960
No, I didn't.

54:32.962 --> 54:36.131
Very... very interesting.

54:36.133 --> 54:38.133
Just stop!

and radish leaves.

55:00.757 --> 55:03.058
Sriracha-brine fried chicken

55:03.060 --> 55:04.625
on rosemary-infused
buttermilk waffles.

55:04.627 --> 55:05.793
Pork medallions

55:05.795 --> 55:07.695
with roasted Brussels sprouts
and kale.

55:07.697 --> 55:12.767
And veal meatloaf with
braised heirloom tomatoes.

55:12.769 --> 55:14.202
So you decided against

55:14.204 --> 55:16.571
using your "Clarissa's"
restaurant menu?

55:16.573 --> 55:17.705
Uh...

55:17.707 --> 55:19.840
Actually, this is, uh,

55:19.842 --> 55:21.142
this is
more "Clarissa's"

55:21.144 --> 55:22.977
than anything I've done
in a long time.

55:22.979 --> 55:26.948
We're grateful
no matter what you make.

55:28.452 --> 55:30.918
Maybe I should've stuck
with what I was doing before,

55:30.920 --> 55:33.754
but, um, just wasn't
exciting me anymore.

55:33.756 --> 55:36.624
Hope you're not
too disappointed.

55:36.626 --> 55:38.493
Don't apologize.
The food is amazing.

55:38.495 --> 55:40.027
We're not disappointed.

55:40.029 --> 55:42.263
Uh, I'm sorry.
It looks great.

55:42.265 --> 55:43.364
I'm terrible.

55:43.366 --> 55:46.434
No, you're just terrible
at not being rich.

55:46.436 --> 55:47.502
[laughs]

55:47.504 --> 55:48.903
You know what?

55:48.905 --> 55:49.870
In 20 years,

55:49.872 --> 55:51.372
we're gonna look back
on this wedding

55:51.374 --> 55:52.840
and be glad
it was small

55:52.842 --> 55:53.841
and just about us.

55:53.843 --> 55:55.176
We're just getting
the "poorer" part

55:55.178 --> 55:56.244
of the vows
out of the way.

55:56.246 --> 55:58.513
Oh, no. The vows!
We haven't written them yet.

55:58.515 --> 55:59.680
I thought
we were just gonna do

55:59.682 --> 56:01.149
the regular ones
everyone else does.

56:01.151 --> 56:02.484
No, we talked about this,
remember?

56:02.486 --> 56:03.651
[James]: When?

56:03.653 --> 56:05.686
[Amy]: Can I just keep
one dream alive?

56:05.688 --> 56:08.123
You mean aside from
living happily ever after?

56:08.125 --> 56:09.290
Yeah, that too.

56:09.292 --> 56:10.691
Mm-hmm.

56:13.196 --> 56:14.629
I have an idea.

56:15.798 --> 56:18.466
[♪♪♪]

56:18.468 --> 56:19.467

56:19.469 --> 56:20.502
you could do
whatever you wanted with them,

56:20.504 --> 56:22.103
so, your call.

56:22.105 --> 56:24.205
What are you guys
talking about?

56:24.207 --> 56:25.706
These letters

56:25.708 --> 56:29.076
that Nick's mom and dad
wrote to each other.

56:29.078 --> 56:30.445
I thought maybe
they'd inspire you

56:30.447 --> 56:32.547
for your vows.

56:32.549 --> 56:34.215
"My lovely Clarissa--

56:34.217 --> 56:37.452
"I never knew
what love really meant

"and then everything
became clear to me.

I ever thought possible.

"I want to hold your hand
through it all,

You challenge me.
You make me better."

57:07.050 --> 57:09.750
"Love was just a word
until I found you."

"with you by my side...

...I'm home."

57:19.663 --> 57:21.262
Sounds a little
schmaltzy to me,

57:21.264 --> 57:22.263
to be honest.

57:22.265 --> 57:23.298
[James]: Yeah. I don't think

57:23.300 --> 57:24.566
I could say that
without laughing.

57:24.568 --> 57:25.633
You were right.

57:25.635 --> 57:27.602
Let's go old-school.

57:27.604 --> 57:28.736
Yeah.

57:28.738 --> 57:31.105
Yeah... bad idea.

57:31.107 --> 57:32.807
Uh, sorry.

57:32.809 --> 57:35.042
Okay, well,
let's get back to work.

57:35.044 --> 57:37.812
Um... right.

57:37.814 --> 57:39.013
So, if you...

57:39.015 --> 57:42.183
start wrapping these,
I can get to work on your dress.

57:42.185 --> 57:43.551
I still have
half the bodice to go.

57:43.553 --> 57:45.886
How about a bachelorette party
for two?

57:45.888 --> 57:48.489
Well, we could order pizza
and hang out while I sew.

57:48.491 --> 57:49.757
Just like when you first
moved to New York.

57:49.759 --> 57:51.492
Except with better wine.

57:51.494 --> 57:52.493
So if they're doing that,

57:52.495 --> 57:54.028
does that mean
I get a bachelor party?

57:54.030 --> 57:55.396
I don't know.
What did you have in mind?

57:55.398 --> 57:57.098
Not like there's a lot
of options around here.

57:57.100 --> 57:59.066
Uh, I'd be happy
playing video games

57:59.068 --> 58:00.468

a plate of nachos.

01:01:05.393 --> 01:01:06.592
Want some?

01:01:06.594 --> 01:01:08.927
Yeah! Yeah.
[laughs]

01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:10.463
All right.
Well, here.

01:01:10.465 --> 01:01:12.465
Take mine.

01:01:14.869 --> 01:01:17.102
I'm, uh...
I'm proud of you, son.

01:01:18.939 --> 01:01:21.840
I know Mom is, too.

01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:24.477
Hey.

01:01:24.479 --> 01:01:26.279
No tears until tonight.

01:01:26.281 --> 01:01:28.281
Why am I gonna cry tonight?

01:01:28.283 --> 01:01:29.482
Have you met Amy's mother?

01:01:29.484 --> 01:01:31.016
[laughing]

01:01:31.018 --> 01:01:32.050
Good morning!

01:01:32.052 --> 01:01:33.051
Hey.

01:01:33.053 --> 01:01:34.052
What's so funny?

01:01:34.054 --> 01:01:35.053
Nothing.

01:01:35.055 --> 01:01:36.221
You guys want some pancakes?

01:01:36.223 --> 01:01:38.123
Do you even have to ask?

01:01:38.125 --> 01:01:39.158
Okay, go. Go, sit.

01:01:40.227 --> 01:01:42.861
[Amy]: Looks like
a beautiful morning.

01:01:42.863 --> 01:01:44.797
[Molly]:
I love this breakfast room.

01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:45.831
[Charlie]: Me too.

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:47.400
[Molly]: It's such great light.

01:01:47.402 --> 01:01:49.368
This is so good.

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:50.836
[Amy]: Wow.

01:01:50.838 --> 01:01:52.171
[James]: My parents
are going to love this place.

01:01:52.173 --> 01:01:53.205
[Amy]: I just hope

01:01:53.207 --> 01:01:54.640
my mom and dad
can find it on time.

01:01:54.642 --> 01:01:55.841
[Molly]:
Oh, the rehearsal dinner--

01:01:55.843 --> 01:01:56.975
it's going to look
so pretty out there.

01:01:56.977 --> 01:01:58.243
[Nick]: Okay, everyone,
here we are.

01:01:58.245 --> 01:01:59.878
[Molly]: Oh, my gosh.
It's going to be perfect.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.246
Here we go, ladies.

01:02:02.216 --> 01:02:04.016
Bon appétit.

01:02:04.018 --> 01:02:05.618
Thank you.

01:02:09.757 --> 01:02:12.124
[♪♪♪]

01:02:17.164 --> 01:02:18.464
[Molly]: These are amazing!

01:02:18.466 --> 01:02:20.833
You know,
your mom used to do that.

01:02:22.102 --> 01:02:24.837
Watch people eat.

01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:26.505
I never knew why.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:30.343
I think I do.

01:02:31.612 --> 01:02:33.512
[♪♪♪]

01:02:33.514 --> 01:02:34.680
Yeah.

01:02:59.139 --> 01:03:01.540
[Molly]: I'd get married here
in a second.

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:04.744
Me too.

01:03:06.848 --> 01:03:08.447
Hypothetically.

01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:10.516
Of course.

01:03:14.255 --> 01:03:15.654
[Amy]: Can we take a look now?

01:03:15.656 --> 01:03:17.256
I'm dying!

01:03:17.258 --> 01:03:18.290
Yeah! Yeah. Come in.

01:03:18.292 --> 01:03:20.225
It's ready.

01:03:23.698 --> 01:03:27.966
[James]: Oh, wow. I can't
believe this is the same barn.

01:03:29.103 --> 01:03:30.936
Oh, Molly...

01:03:31.972 --> 01:03:33.305
I know it's not
what you had planned

01:03:33.307 --> 01:03:34.640
in the city, but--

01:03:34.642 --> 01:03:37.309
Stop.
It is beautiful.

01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:39.278
[chuckles]

01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:43.616
[♪♪♪]

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.958
All right, everyone,
welcome.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.093
In honor of my best friend,
James,

01:03:55.095 --> 01:03:56.429
and his lovely bride, Amy,

01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:57.897
and their wonderful parents,

01:03:57.899 --> 01:04:00.265
who are joining us
for rehearsal dinner,

01:04:00.267 --> 01:04:03.769
I have prepared my mom's
favorite fried chicken

01:04:03.771 --> 01:04:06.004
with a Nick Turner twist.

01:04:06.006 --> 01:04:08.206
It's a Sriracha brine

01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:12.010
served on a rosemary-infused
buttermilk waffle

01:04:12.012 --> 01:04:14.847
and it has a paprika crema
with it,

01:04:14.849 --> 01:04:16.081
so please enjoy.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:18.250
Ah.

01:04:18.252 --> 01:04:19.785
And, for you...

01:04:19.787 --> 01:04:21.720
special order.

01:04:21.722 --> 01:04:23.221
Macaroni and cheese?

01:04:23.223 --> 01:04:25.691
As promised.

01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:32.230
All right.

01:04:33.734 --> 01:04:36.034
You seem to be
taking this rather well, sir.

01:04:36.036 --> 01:04:39.037
There's a certain freedom
in charting a new course.

01:04:39.039 --> 01:04:41.507
It reminds me of when
I just started out.

01:04:41.509 --> 01:04:45.143
Meanwhile, my diamonds
are in the display window

01:04:45.145 --> 01:04:47.580
at 3rd Street
Pawn and Loan.

01:04:47.582 --> 01:04:49.515
We'll be okay,
Diane.

01:04:49.517 --> 01:04:51.116
I know.

01:04:51.118 --> 01:04:52.518
You do?

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.519
Yeah,
we did it once,

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:56.489
we can
do it again.

01:04:57.492 --> 01:04:58.791
I think this is
a good time for a toast.

01:04:58.793 --> 01:05:00.726
Mm.

01:05:00.728 --> 01:05:02.795
To Amy and James,

01:05:02.797 --> 01:05:05.531
who are charting
their own new course together.

01:05:05.533 --> 01:05:09.735
Someday, if the path goes in
an unexpected direction...

01:05:09.737 --> 01:05:11.837
don't be afraid to take it.

01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:15.774
It may lead you
to exactly where you need to be.

01:05:15.776 --> 01:05:17.576
Cheers.

01:05:17.578 --> 01:05:20.913
As long as our path doesn't
take us out of New York City.

01:05:20.915 --> 01:05:22.014
Cheers!

01:05:22.016 --> 01:05:23.949
You're never leaving Manhattan.
We know.

01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:25.851
You've made yourself
perfectly clear.

01:05:25.853 --> 01:05:28.453
And so have you.
You want out.

01:05:28.455 --> 01:05:30.656
You think I want to
raise kids in the city?

01:05:30.658 --> 01:05:33.191
[Amy]: What's wrong with
raising kids in the city?

01:05:33.193 --> 01:05:34.226
Nothing, but...

01:05:34.228 --> 01:05:35.628
the country gives us
room to breathe.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:38.330
Excuse me, but I need
some room to breathe.

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:41.233
Yeah. Good idea.

01:05:43.137 --> 01:05:45.437
[♪♪♪]

01:05:47.742 --> 01:05:51.043
It's just
pre-wedding jitters.

01:05:51.045 --> 01:05:52.545
I'm sure
they'll be fine.

01:05:52.547 --> 01:05:54.547
Excuse me.

01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:57.349
[♪♪♪]

01:05:59.153 --> 01:06:03.022
Do you think that
Amy and James are okay?

01:06:04.324 --> 01:06:06.358
I don't even think
they're in love.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.961
[sighing]

01:06:08.963 --> 01:06:10.395
Me neither.

01:06:12.033 --> 01:06:14.132
But then again...

01:06:14.134 --> 01:06:17.235
I mean, what do we
know about love?

01:06:18.372 --> 01:06:21.306
We don't even know
what it feels like.

01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:24.877
[♪♪♪]

01:06:27.982 --> 01:06:29.314
I think
it feels like this.

01:06:33.821 --> 01:06:36.354
[♪♪♪]

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.607
Yeah...

01:06:54.609 --> 01:06:56.609
I think
it feels like that.

01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:01.080
Okay, so we're
in agreement, right?

01:07:01.082 --> 01:07:03.181
Neither of us
is gonna say anything

01:07:03.183 --> 01:07:04.984
to James and Amy
tomorrow?

01:07:04.986 --> 01:07:06.919
Right?
It's their wedding.

01:07:06.921 --> 01:07:08.220
It's their decision.

01:07:08.222 --> 01:07:10.255
Yep. Agreed.
None of our business.

01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:11.757
Right.

01:07:11.759 --> 01:07:13.158
This is me.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.028
Right.

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.162
Goodnight.

01:07:17.164 --> 01:07:19.197
Goodnight.

01:07:22.569 --> 01:07:24.202
Is this, like,
the live version

01:07:24.204 --> 01:07:26.138
of "you hang up,
no, you hang up?"

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.507
No. No, because that
would just be sad.

01:07:28.509 --> 01:07:29.474
Totally.

01:07:29.476 --> 01:07:30.475
Right.

01:07:30.477 --> 01:07:31.610
-You hang up.
-No, you.

01:07:31.612 --> 01:07:33.478
[laughing]

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:36.181
So you're not gonna say
anything to James, right?

01:07:36.183 --> 01:07:37.850
As long as you don't
say anything to Amy.

01:07:37.852 --> 01:07:38.817
I'm not.

01:07:38.819 --> 01:07:39.818
Okay. Me either.

01:07:41.756 --> 01:07:44.189
[♪♪♪]

01:07:49.496 --> 01:07:50.829
Goodnight.

01:07:50.831 --> 01:07:53.198
Goodnight.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.734
[♪♪♪]

01:08:02.969 --> 01:08:05.136
[♪♪♪]

01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:27.524
[knocking on doors]

01:08:30.363 --> 01:08:31.462
-Amy--
-Hey.

01:08:31.464 --> 01:08:33.698
[Overlapping]:
We need to talk.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:37.568
I'm just trying to give you
a little "BFF Reality Check."

01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:38.602
I just need to make sure

01:08:38.604 --> 01:08:40.371
that you guys are really
on the same page.

01:08:40.372 --> 01:08:42.773
Are you sure that you and Amy
are still on the same page

01:08:42.774 --> 01:08:44.309
about what you want
for your future?

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.408
Ah, she's just nervous.

01:08:45.411 --> 01:08:46.845
Her whole life
was turned upside-down,

01:08:46.846 --> 01:08:48.011
and she hasn't had a chance
to process it.

01:08:48.014 --> 01:08:49.814
It's not just your wedding day.

01:08:49.816 --> 01:08:52.483
This is the rest of your life.

01:08:52.484 --> 01:08:55.553
I guess it's more about knowing
whether you're happy...

01:08:55.555 --> 01:08:57.587
or just going
through the motions.

01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.291
I'm not the guy
who doesn't believe in love.

01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:02.560
This from the girl who runs
from every relationship?

01:09:02.562 --> 01:09:04.694
Are you trying to talk me
out of getting married?

01:09:04.697 --> 01:09:06.731
Are you trying to talk me
out of marrying James?

01:09:06.733 --> 01:09:07.765
Of course not.

01:09:07.767 --> 01:09:09.834
I'm just saying,
if you're having doubts,

01:09:09.836 --> 01:09:10.902
you should talk to him.

01:09:10.904 --> 01:09:12.403
Okay, even if
I was having doubts,

01:09:12.404 --> 01:09:14.839
I would never leave Amy
on our wedding night.

01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:16.506
She doesn't deserve that.

01:09:16.509 --> 01:09:18.475
Especially after everything
she's been through.

01:09:18.478 --> 01:09:19.676
Okay.

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:21.779
-Well, I'm here if you need me.
-I'm here for you.

01:09:21.781 --> 01:09:24.448
[♪♪♪]

01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:31.256
[Charlie]: Welcome again.
Nice to see you.

01:09:31.258 --> 01:09:32.390
Please go on in.

01:09:32.392 --> 01:09:33.724
[woman]: Too bad this place
isn't open for business.

01:09:33.725 --> 01:09:37.194
It's stunning.
Just gorgeous.

01:09:39.099 --> 01:09:40.098
[Charlie]: Welcome. Welcome.

01:09:43.435 --> 01:09:46.104
[♪♪♪]

01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:52.076
Everything okay
with James?

01:09:52.078 --> 01:09:55.113
Yeah. Sure.
Why wouldn't it be?

01:09:55.115 --> 01:09:56.614
Is everything okay
with Amy?

01:09:56.616 --> 01:09:58.649
Of course. Yeah.

01:09:58.651 --> 01:10:02.220
It's the, um, happiest
day of her life.

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.655
Molly?

01:10:04.657 --> 01:10:07.658
You did a wonderful job
with Clarissa's roses.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.161
Wait.
They're Clarissa's?

01:10:10.163 --> 01:10:11.362
Mm-hmm.

01:10:11.364 --> 01:10:12.663
You didn't
say that before.

01:10:12.665 --> 01:10:14.232
I didn't say
a lot of things.

01:10:14.234 --> 01:10:15.499
But that's done now.

01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:17.701
[music rises]

01:10:17.703 --> 01:10:19.503
That's your cue.

01:10:19.505 --> 01:10:22.140
Okay. Here we go.

01:10:27.647 --> 01:10:29.480
[hushed]: Hey.

01:10:29.482 --> 01:10:31.449
You look stunning,
by the way.

01:10:32.652 --> 01:10:34.585
Thanks.

01:10:34.587 --> 01:10:36.354
You look...

01:10:36.356 --> 01:10:39.357
whatever the man-version
of stunning is.

01:10:39.359 --> 01:10:40.992
Thank you.

01:10:40.994 --> 01:10:43.594
[music continues]

01:10:43.596 --> 01:10:45.930
[♪♪♪]

01:10:47.434 --> 01:10:49.633
Uh... Where's James?

01:10:49.635 --> 01:10:51.369
Shouldn't he be
up here already?

01:10:51.371 --> 01:10:53.104
Do you think
something's wrong?
