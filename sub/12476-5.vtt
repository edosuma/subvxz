00:05.439 --> 00:07.473
<i> Man's destruction</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:10.142

00:11.278 --> 00:12.444

00:15.950 --> 00:19.018
<i> One man saw</i>

00:19.020 --> 00:22.621
<i> He created an ark for mankind</i>

00:22.623 --> 00:24.056

00:44.078 --> 00:45.477
<i> Previously on</i> Wayward Pines...

00:45.479 --> 00:47.146
JASON:

00:48.916 --> 00:51.116
<i> And Adam's the only one</i>

00:52.686 --> 00:54.353
JASON:
They're gone.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.088
This is a rare opportunity.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.724
With the Abbies retreated,
we can work without fear.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.060
I want to come with you.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.394
Let me find my son.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.596
(growling and snarling)

01:06.067 --> 01:07.966
(sniffling)

01:09.236 --> 01:11.770
But every time one thing here

01:11.772 --> 01:13.005
seems almost rational,

01:13.007 --> 01:14.406
two things pop up that make

01:14.408 --> 01:16.075
absolutely no sense at all.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.411
Every member
of our community has a duty

01:19.413 --> 01:21.914
to ensure the future
of the human race.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.415
Lucy has a choice.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.717
Actually, Rebecca,
she really doesn't.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.419
(crying):
I don't want to be a mom.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.922
Frank, help me with your sister.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.190
You told her.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.025
CJ:
The Abbies are gone, Doctor.

01:33.027 --> 01:35.094
But we have a chance
to secure our future

01:35.096 --> 01:37.096
and start forging a new path.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.297
You're underestimating them.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.932
(Abbies growling)

01:59.053 --> 02:00.986
(alarm ringing)

02:09.263 --> 02:10.963
THEO:
Please don't go to work today.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.031
Sorry. I have to.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.422
We should go someplace.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.525
Galapagos.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.861
Machu Picchu.

02:42.863 --> 02:46.465
I can't tell if you're
actually being serious.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.433
Oh, I am. Those
are real places.

02:48.435 --> 02:51.236
(scoffs) Those places
are very far away.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.150
(shower water running)

03:05.152 --> 03:07.186
Theo?

03:07.188 --> 03:09.955
How about a beach?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.223
Hawaii.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.393
Honey, we're
going to Hawaii.

03:20.634 --> 03:21.667
Can you pull
the projected estimates

03:21.669 --> 03:22.668
for the Peterson Project?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.169
I'm sorry.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.704
I was told to give
all the materials to Alex.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.905
What? To Alex?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.073
No, he hasn't been
brought up to speed.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.209
I think they're going
with his proposal.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.145
So they're stealing
my project away from me?

03:34.315 --> 03:35.380
I'm sorry.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.250
Push everything.
I want the entire team

03:38.252 --> 03:40.185
on a conference call
right away, okay?

03:40.187 --> 03:42.888
There's a man
in your office.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.757
He wouldn't wait
at reception.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.602
Rebecca Yedlin?

03:56.604 --> 03:59.071
David Pilcher.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.339
Tell me,

04:00.341 --> 04:03.575
is that Piers Park?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.677
My father used to
take me sailing there.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.446
Mr. Pilchner...
Pilcher.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.513
Right.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.848
Maybe you've heard of my book.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.516
<i>The Coming Crisis:</i>

04:11.518 --> 04:14.286
<i>Human Adaptation</i>
<i>to Environmental Pressure.</i>

04:14.288 --> 04:15.988
What is it that you want?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.690
Yes. Yes, of course.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.427
Uh... Well, I'd like you
to consider a project.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.630
An ambitious project.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.766
Something historic.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.371
And what kind
of a building would that be?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.706
Let me tell you
about it over dinner.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.978
PILCHER:
Montrachet.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.615
The most noble
of the white Burgundies.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.052
Californian Chardonnay
presents right from the bottle.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.888
Instant gratification
for the American palate.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.056
It should be about

04:51.058 --> 04:54.159
what ages,

04:54.161 --> 04:55.994
what lasts.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.138
My Harvard thesis.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.741
I haven't seen
this in years.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.678
You thought your title was bad?

05:15.582 --> 05:16.848
How did you get this?

05:16.850 --> 05:19.651
I surround myself with people

05:19.653 --> 05:22.654
who are very good
at getting me things I want.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.956
This is quite impressive.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.793
You're a fan of Henry Clubb,
I see.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.429
He's the reason
I'm an architect.

05:30.431 --> 05:34.333
In 1856, he built a settlement

05:34.335 --> 05:35.801
called the...
The Octagon City.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.836
Yes, I know.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.104
And it failed.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.873
Yes.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.945
What if we were to have
a second chance?

05:46.947 --> 05:50.716
To start over...

05:50.718 --> 05:53.518
with a small,
enlightened community?

05:53.520 --> 05:58.457
That grew gradually,

05:58.459 --> 06:00.892
until it became
the most essential,

06:00.894 --> 06:02.694
the most significant community

06:02.696 --> 06:05.664
that the world had ever known.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.599
You'd want to be a part of that,
wouldn't you?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.302
I think anyone would.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.137
You'd be surprised.

06:12.139 --> 06:15.140
I believe the flood
is coming, Rebecca.

06:17.144 --> 06:21.046
It will make all things new.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.881
We need an ark.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.583
I need you to design it.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.650
(sighs)

06:27.654 --> 06:29.421
What you're proposing sounds...

06:29.423 --> 06:31.656
Crazy. Yes, I know.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.760
You get used to people
looking at you

06:34.762 --> 06:36.428
as a crackpot.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.497
False prophet.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.066
It can weigh you down.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.201
Weigh anyone down.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.703
But if you
believe in something--

06:44.705 --> 06:45.771
if you...

06:45.773 --> 06:48.507
truly believe,

06:48.509 --> 06:51.276
then you'll fight for it.

06:53.247 --> 06:57.015
I was going to say what you're
proposing sounds expensive.

06:57.017 --> 07:01.052
I would be willing to pay
whatever it takes.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.956
I'm prepared
to give my last dime for this.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.593
I am searching
for dreamers like myself.

07:08.595 --> 07:12.898
Are you a dreamer,
Rebecca?

07:12.900 --> 07:15.367
Wouldn't you like
the opportunity...

07:17.571 --> 07:20.872
...to build the city you've
always dreamt of building?

07:22.443 --> 07:24.476

Hey, every girl in school

10:44.911 --> 10:46.745
There are no signs

10:46.747 --> 10:49.848

any blood work.

Oh, there is this, though.

Well, we're not sure.

It's not natural,
nor does it look like

11:20.380 --> 11:22.614
the combat scarring
we've seen

11:22.616 --> 11:24.115
on some of the males.

11:24.117 --> 11:27.052
It might be something
anthropological.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.654
Anthropological?

11:29.656 --> 11:31.489
They're not a lost tribe.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.658
They're animals. Gonna check
the Pilcher research again.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.662

11:37.664 --> 11:40.699
The Abbies that breached
the fence on Invasion Day,

11:40.701 --> 11:42.333
those were all males.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.802
I mean, we knew

11:43.804 --> 11:45.303
the females were
out there, obviously,

11:45.305 --> 11:48.306
and as with any species,
they're different.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.842
We just don't know
how different.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.145
Maybe I can unearth something
that will help us.

That one's Max.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.844
Another bully.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.011
He hated high school.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.047
Me, too.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.849
My ex-girlfriend--

12:30.851 --> 12:33.752
whenever I apologized,
she just stared at me.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.454
So I named her Margaret.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.089
I'm sorry, Margaret.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.595
We completed
the sweep on the town.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.797
No other Abbies were found.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.931
Good and the fence?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.533
The fence is secure.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.301
Then can you explain to me

12:50.303 --> 12:51.603
how an Abby ended up

12:51.605 --> 12:53.271
on our carousel on Main Street?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.640
Maybe she was here all along.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.908
She's docile.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.209
She could have
went undetected.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.043
KERRY: Maybe when
the fence was opened

12:59.045 --> 13:00.044
and the explorers left?

13:00.046 --> 13:01.312
Or someone helped it.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.181
Who would do that?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.624
Keep working on it.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.270
You could help

13:25.272 --> 13:26.571
those two
with the water samples,

13:26.573 --> 13:27.972
if it's not too
much trouble.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.341
You got a shovel handy?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.477
'Cause I could help you
dig some graves.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.079
Is that why you came back?

13:35.081 --> 13:37.081
To preach the end of the world?

13:37.083 --> 13:39.617
'Cause none of us
intend to die out here.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.319
When they come...

13:41.321 --> 13:43.822
it won't matter.

14:00.340 --> 14:05.043
Pines have a life expectancy
of over 5,000 years.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.312
It's a terrible
thing to outlive

14:07.314 --> 14:08.580
everything around
you, isn't it?

14:10.016 --> 14:12.817
Nature is cruel that way.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.620
(sighs)

14:15.622 --> 14:17.555
I'm not going back, CJ.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.293
We can't be completely sure
if the Abbies are gone.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.996
You should go back
where it's safe.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.065
No, I've made my decision;
I'm staying here.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.134
It's safer inside.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.304
Ben's out here.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.242
And I'm never gonna leave
my son again.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.043
I'm-I'm still his mother.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.647
I don't need
your protection.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.918
You might have to tell him
the same thing.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.524
That man is the reason
why my whole family is dead.

14:53.526 --> 14:57.495
Yes... but he's also the reason
why you're still alive.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.077
First time in Idaho?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.146
Yeah, it's beautiful.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.616
Across here.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.191
Oh, wow.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.564
This is where we will
build our tomorrow.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.601
Unfortunately,
all these trees

15:36.603 --> 15:39.570
will have to go,
except for the pines.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.072
They age better.

15:41.074 --> 15:44.876
Looks like there's
a town already there.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.211
Not for long.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.283
I'd like for you to meet
the rest of the team.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.385
Everyone...

15:54.387 --> 15:56.321
Ah.
meet our architect.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.388
Hi.
This is Rebecca.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.257
Hi.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.325
Hey.
I'm Megan.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.226
I loved your plans.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.063
The way you put
the cars and the garages

16:05.065 --> 16:06.264
in the back of the houses.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.066
It's just so elegant,

16:08.068 --> 16:10.835
and with everything close by,
who needs to drive anyway?

16:10.837 --> 16:12.603
I mean, it's such
an obvious way

16:12.605 --> 16:14.105
to encourage
socialization...

16:14.107 --> 16:15.974
but still...

16:15.976 --> 16:18.910
kudos.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.079
Thank you.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.915
Is that where we'll build
our base of operations?

16:23.917 --> 16:25.583
PILCHER:
Well, we've already started.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.085
It's on the other side
of the mountain.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.287
But you'll have...

16:29.289 --> 16:31.022
you'll have ample time
to explore up there

16:31.024 --> 16:32.256
after dinner tonight.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.825
Uh-huh.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.282
Hey, Jason.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.718
(door bell jingling) Rebecca,
as you may have heard,

17:00.720 --> 17:01.819
the Abby on Main Street

17:01.821 --> 17:03.988
was the only one.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.123
Good news.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.657
You designed this place.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.192
Now I need your help.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.962
It's my job to keep
this town safe.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.031
Are you sure the fence
is impenetrable?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.465
The fence is secure.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.135
What if you're wrong?
Then we're dead.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.570
My designs are not
the problem here, Jason.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.376
How are things at home?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.311
Fine.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.213
Good.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.682
Good.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.318
Then I trust you
told him everything?

17:34.320 --> 17:36.888
It's not good to keep
secrets, Rebecca.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.059
(door bell jingling)

17:42.362 --> 17:44.629
(door closes)

18:01.247 --> 18:03.014
(sighs)

18:16.196 --> 18:18.262
(students chattering)

18:21.601 --> 18:24.435
I-I'd-I'd like to re-reschedule.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.037
You're locker number four.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.872
Procreation room nine.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.312
Are there cameras?

18:34.314 --> 18:36.247
In the... in the rooms?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.815
There aren't cameras.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.385
Procreation room nine.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.326
(mellow jazz intro playing)

18:50.063 --> 18:51.629
(door closes)

18:51.631 --> 18:52.763
Hey, Frank.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.399
Meadow, hi.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.738

No. I-I mean,

20:32.398 --> 20:34.198

it's just this setup.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.167
Uh... should...

20:36.169 --> 20:38.936
um... let me...

20:43.243 --> 20:44.442
What?

20:44.444 --> 20:46.110
I get it.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.745
Okay? You don't like me.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.847
No. I mean... w-wait.
Th-that's not...

20:49.849 --> 20:51.649
Then what is it?

20:57.957 --> 20:59.757
You're right.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.925
We're not a good match.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.960
I-I'm more into blondes, anyway.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.967
Yeah, well, maybe you're not
a good match for anyone.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.969
Don't worry.
I'll let them know.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.706
(door opens)

21:15.708 --> 21:16.774
(door slams)

21:22.548 --> 21:24.282
Is he in?

21:31.991 --> 21:33.724
Yes, he's in.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.961
But he's very busy.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.462
And unfortunately,
we're not accepting

21:38.464 --> 21:40.464
any new walk-ins

21:40.466 --> 21:41.732
at this time.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.586
You asked to see me?

22:02.588 --> 22:04.655
I heard you caught
one of those creatures

22:04.657 --> 22:06.257
in the middle of town.
We did.

22:06.259 --> 22:08.793
She's secure in the lab.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.960
Still alive?

22:09.962 --> 22:13.130
Yes.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.032
You said "she."
How do you know that?

22:15.034 --> 22:16.934
It doesn't take a gynecologist,
Dr. Yedlin.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.371
So you have
a real lab here?

22:20.373 --> 22:22.440
In the Mountain, yes.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.808
We've been studying the males,

22:23.810 --> 22:26.877
but this could
be a real opportunity.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.946
We've never caught a female.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.881
Never even seen one.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.850
Little more the left,
I think, there.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.619
So who's running your
scientific research team?

22:35.621 --> 22:38.189
Because if somebody
has the appropriate training,

22:38.191 --> 22:39.957
I have yet to meet them.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.692
Well, it's not your training,
either.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.993
Unless you've completed

22:42.995 --> 22:44.895
a veterinary rotation
I'm not aware of.

22:44.897 --> 22:45.830
You need someone
who understands protocols,

22:45.832 --> 22:47.398
medical ethics.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.533
Unless those are part

22:49.535 --> 22:52.470
of the old rules that
Wayward Pines seems exempt from.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.740
Well, there are plenty of things
we're grateful to leave behind.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.475
But in this case, yes.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.876
The old rules
should still apply.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.044
Wonderful.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.413
Put me in charge then.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.914
Of the research.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.250
You need someone
who's qualified.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.419
I could do that.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.088
But if I support this,
and it moves forward,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.958
you may step on some toes.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.430
Great.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.765
Just let me know
when you'd like to start,

23:20.767 --> 23:22.767
and I'll introduce you
to your team.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.536
(Margaret growling)

23:25.538 --> 23:27.605
MEGAN:
Dr. Yedlin.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.273
Please, come.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.542
We're about to extract
some cerebrospinal fluid.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.943
Would you like to observe?

23:37.784 --> 23:39.350
Why isn't she sedated?

23:39.352 --> 23:40.518
It's also a study

23:40.520 --> 23:42.520
of the pain reflex.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.054
We need to know if pain

23:44.056 --> 23:45.356
can be used as a deterrent.

23:45.358 --> 23:46.791
She can be monitored,

23:46.793 --> 23:48.626
but she's not
to be touched in any way.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.797
Dr. Yedlin will be
joining your team, Megan.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.765
I'll actually be leading it,
per our agreement.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.300
Oh.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.969
Does Jason know about this?

23:58.971 --> 24:01.138
Jason is on board.
And Dr. Yedlin

24:01.140 --> 24:02.706
is a world-class surgeon

24:02.708 --> 24:04.308
who's received numerous awards

24:04.310 --> 24:05.476
and fellowships.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.644
Learning as much as we can,

24:06.646 --> 24:07.912
as quickly as we can,

24:07.914 --> 24:09.947
is what's best
for Wayward Pines.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.483
I'll leave you two to your work.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.085
I'm sure a world-class surgeon
and a world-class hypnotherapist

24:15.087 --> 24:17.455
have a lot to talk about.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.724
Excuse me.
Did she say "hypnotherapist"?

24:20.726 --> 24:23.561
That was a long time ago.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.897
I have completed many years
of study and research

24:26.899 --> 24:28.332
since then.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.767
I'll be by tomorrow morning.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.101
We'll lay out
a proper set of protocols.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.237
Wonderful.
I look forward to it.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.414
Do it.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.034
(low, indistinct conversation)

25:08.875 --> 25:10.407
(utensil clinking on goblet)

25:12.778 --> 25:16.046
First of all,
I would like to say

25:16.048 --> 25:18.382
how ecstatic I am

25:18.384 --> 25:21.385
about all the work
you've done.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.387
When we first met,
you told me that

25:23.389 --> 25:25.222
you wanted to blow up the world

25:25.224 --> 25:26.657
and start over.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.527
Well, believe me,

25:29.529 --> 25:31.862
you're well on the way.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.265
Your designs are amazing.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.037
REBECCA:
Thank you.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.272
Thank you, David.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.174
Thank you.

25:44.176 --> 25:48.078
I do have
a-a confession to make.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.314
It's important you understand

25:50.316 --> 25:53.150
the full scope of our plans.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.553
Okay. Terrific.

25:55.555 --> 25:59.690
Construction on the designs
that you've laid out,

25:59.692 --> 26:02.760
will-will not take place
for some time.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.930
Are we looking at a year?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.199
Five years?

26:09.201 --> 26:11.268
(laughter)

26:14.340 --> 26:17.841
This wine we're drinking--
Nerello--

26:17.843 --> 26:19.877
it's from Mt. Etna.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.111
It's my favorite wine.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.514
Grown on the side
of a volcano,

26:23.516 --> 26:25.215
but what is it
about this wine

26:25.217 --> 26:28.185
that makes it so special?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.454
Is it the grape or the vintner?

26:30.456 --> 26:32.590
Or is it the climate?

26:34.760 --> 26:35.893
No. It's the soil.

26:35.895 --> 26:39.563
The product of dozens,

26:39.565 --> 26:41.865
hundreds of eruptions
over thousands of years,

26:41.867 --> 26:45.936
constantly transforming
the chemical

26:45.938 --> 26:48.939
and mineral makeup
of that soil.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.810
And yet, after all that
turbulence and upheaval,

26:52.812 --> 26:56.647
after that violence,
and destruction,

26:56.649 --> 27:00.551
(chuckles) nature leaves us
with a beautiful

27:00.553 --> 27:02.686
and delicious gift.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.957
The timing, the location,

27:06.959 --> 27:10.327
were crucial.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.996
MEGAN: The next

27:11.998 --> 27:15.566
cataclysmic disaster
is right around the corner.

27:15.568 --> 27:16.800
And the only way

27:16.802 --> 27:20.004
to ensure our survival,

27:20.006 --> 27:22.973
is to slingshot
past the event.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.910
A select group of volunteers,

27:26.912 --> 27:30.781
all true believers,

27:30.783 --> 27:33.417
will be put into cryogenic pods,

27:33.419 --> 27:37.354
housed in this very facility...

27:37.356 --> 27:39.590
where we will sleep...

27:39.592 --> 27:41.925
for 2,000 years.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.994
When we awake,

27:43.996 --> 27:46.363
all our algorithms tell us

27:46.365 --> 27:49.466
the threat will
have passed,

27:49.468 --> 27:51.435
and we will build our Utopia.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.937
<i> Your</i> Utopia.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.807
MEGAN:
The Earth will be ready

27:56.809 --> 27:58.976
to begin again.
Now, Rebecca,

27:58.978 --> 28:02.846
I'm sure you have hundreds,
thousands, of questions

28:02.848 --> 28:04.381
(laughs)
about all of this.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.216
We'll be happy

28:06.218 --> 28:09.553
to elucidate you
on the details,

28:09.555 --> 28:10.888
but I thought
it was important

28:10.890 --> 28:12.556
at this stage to...

28:12.558 --> 28:15.025
to bring you up to speed.

28:15.027 --> 28:18.362
It is my hope that you will be
my partner and collaborator,

28:18.364 --> 28:22.866
as we witness the birth
of this new world.

28:27.973 --> 28:30.507
Uh... (chuckles)
this is, uh, uh,

28:30.509 --> 28:31.508
it's a lot to absorb.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.576
(Pilcher chuckles)

28:34.580 --> 28:36.246
Uh, of course, I'm...

28:36.248 --> 28:38.415
I'm honored to be
a part of this.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.018
And I can't wait.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.920
And this is, uh...

28:42.922 --> 28:45.556
It's a very bold plan.
It's amazing.

28:58.871 --> 29:01.805
Hey, how did it all go?

29:04.376 --> 29:05.743
I can't.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.946
Bec, tell me.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.050
What if you made
an error of judgment?

29:13.052 --> 29:14.384
What if--

29:14.386 --> 29:17.054
okay, just bear with me.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.389
What if you made a mistake,

29:19.391 --> 29:22.526
and you couldn't
find a way out of it?

29:22.528 --> 29:24.261
He's not for real, is he?

29:24.263 --> 29:26.497
I wish he wasn't.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.200
I was worried that something
like this could happen.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.905
I just wish I'd never
gotten involved with this.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.908
I just feel like
such a failure.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.877
You haven't failed.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.545
Just tell them you're out.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.781
They come after you, fine.
I'll take care of it.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.350
(phone ringing)

29:50.823 --> 29:53.056
Hospital.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.792
Got to go back.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.560
We're gonna
get through this.

29:56.562 --> 29:57.795
We are.

30:04.804 --> 30:07.738
THERESA:
I had a dream last night.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.273
I went back

30:09.275 --> 30:12.509
and I walked into the house,
and Ben was there,

30:12.511 --> 30:16.480
and he ran right
into my arms and...

30:16.482 --> 30:19.950
Ethan was really upset,

30:19.952 --> 30:22.286
but he was happy
that I was home.

30:22.288 --> 30:26.990
There is nothing left for me
inside that fence.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.325
Theresa...

30:32.531 --> 30:34.765
...you weren't
supposed to follow him.

30:34.767 --> 30:37.868
I could've taken
care of you,

30:37.870 --> 30:39.803
but you ended up here.

30:39.805 --> 30:42.105
You and Ben.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.942
(sighs)
And I had-I had to follow you.

30:46.979 --> 30:50.047
Adam, what are you saying?

30:50.049 --> 30:52.115
I wanted Ethan gone.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.519
I know it was wrong.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.187
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.024
I'm sorry.

31:06.332 --> 31:09.366
I was in the procreation room.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.201
With Meadow.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.639
I couldn't get past K.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.074
I wasn't into it.

31:19.712 --> 31:20.711
That happens.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.980
Meadow, Ashley...

31:24.483 --> 31:25.849
I mean I wasn't into<i> it.</i>

31:25.851 --> 31:28.418
No, I mean, I...

31:28.420 --> 31:29.887
I don't know,
they-they put you

31:29.889 --> 31:31.421
in this crazy room

31:31.423 --> 31:32.990
and you have to remember
all these steps, you know.

31:32.992 --> 31:33.991
(stammers)
Do you think that's it?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.225
That I just forgot

31:35.227 --> 31:36.894
some of the steps? I mean...
(stammers)

31:36.896 --> 31:38.161
I don't know if there's...

31:41.433 --> 31:44.167
You think maybe you're gay?

31:44.169 --> 31:46.103
I'm not gay at all.

31:46.105 --> 31:49.373
I'm, like, the opposite of gay.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.441
I'm feeling
very un-gay right now.

31:52.778 --> 31:55.412
The word doesn't
just mean happy.

31:56.282 --> 31:57.514
Has no one ever

31:57.516 --> 31:59.616
discussed this with you?

31:59.618 --> 32:00.851
Discussed what?

32:00.853 --> 32:02.920
Same-sex attraction.

32:04.857 --> 32:06.523
Doctor, please.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.691
There is nothing
wrong with you.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.359
(sighs)

32:09.361 --> 32:11.295
I'm just gonna tell them...
Y-you have to give me,

32:11.297 --> 32:12.562
you have to give me something.

32:12.564 --> 32:13.897
Can you give me something?

32:13.899 --> 32:15.299
A-a pill,
or some kind of treatment?

32:15.301 --> 32:17.034
Frank, just calm down.
No, please!

32:19.305 --> 32:20.704
Look...

32:20.706 --> 32:22.906
(sighs)

32:22.908 --> 32:25.042
Can you tell them that I'll,
that I'll do it again next time,

32:25.044 --> 32:26.243
and I'll remember all the steps?

32:26.245 --> 32:27.744
I'll-I'll do everything,
I promise.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.413
Frank, you don't need anything.
There are rules,

32:29.415 --> 32:30.647
okay?

32:30.649 --> 32:31.915
I have to reproduce.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.583
It's-it's
my glorious obligation.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.419
But if I'm sick,

32:35.421 --> 32:37.321
and they find out
that I can't do it...

32:39.291 --> 32:41.591
...they'll kill me.

32:41.593 --> 32:42.993
I won't let that happen.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.639
Rebecca.

32:57.810 --> 33:00.010
(sighs) Tell him.

33:00.012 --> 33:02.479
Why are you here?

33:02.481 --> 33:05.082
(softly):
Tell him.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.956
Xander and I are married.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.725
He's my husband.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.101
I was kidnapped,

33:24.103 --> 33:26.570
and put to sleep.

33:27.873 --> 33:30.707
When I woke up,
you weren't here.

33:30.709 --> 33:34.177
I was all alone
in this mess.

33:34.179 --> 33:37.381
I didn't know what to
make of this place,

33:37.383 --> 33:39.149
how to survive in this town.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.150
I thought you were dead.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.551
So you marry him?

33:41.553 --> 33:42.986
They match people together,
we don't...

33:42.988 --> 33:43.920
Hey, stop talking.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.258
How long?

33:49.862 --> 33:51.461
One year.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.563
But we haven't been together
for six months now.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.365
Oh, geez.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.134
Theo, please try
to understand.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.702
THEO:
What?

33:58.704 --> 34:03.206
That you married another man
while I was a popsicle?

34:03.208 --> 34:04.541
Or that you've lied to me

34:04.543 --> 34:05.809
since the moment I woke up?

34:05.811 --> 34:07.377
I haven't been lying.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.012
I just didn't want
to overwhelm you.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.547
But you dragged me into the bed

34:10.549 --> 34:12.849
that you shared with him.

34:12.851 --> 34:13.917
(sighs)

34:13.919 --> 34:15.252
This is not her fault, man.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.437
(grunting)
Theo!

34:35.374 --> 34:36.706
Oh, God.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.308
You all right?

34:41.547 --> 34:42.813
(door opens)

34:44.883 --> 34:46.149
(sighs)

34:48.053 --> 34:50.720
So, this is where you hide.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.690
You're, uh, you're not
gonna jump off are you?

34:53.692 --> 34:55.792
Very funny.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.931
Do you ever wonder
what's out there?

35:05.537 --> 35:08.305
All the time.

35:08.307 --> 35:11.274
They tell us
not to think about it,

35:11.276 --> 35:14.077
and I try not to think about it.

35:14.079 --> 35:18.448
But sometimes
I see it in my dreams.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.217
(sighs)
Where no one's telling us

35:20.219 --> 35:22.152
what to do all our lives.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.223
Where... I'm not gonna spend
the rest of my life

35:26.225 --> 35:27.591
washing people's hair.

35:27.593 --> 35:31.228
Hey, at least you have a job.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.330
I'm still unassigned.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.798
You're lucky.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.969
I doubt it.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.405
I'm sorry, Luce.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.975
I know.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.978
I'm having
a really hard time right now.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.981
I'll protect you, Frank.

35:52.117 --> 35:53.783
You're my kid sister.

35:53.785 --> 35:57.254
I think I'm supposed
to be protecting you.

35:59.091 --> 36:01.158
I'll protect you.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.195
Thank you.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.568
(computers whirring quietly)

36:14.106 --> 36:15.839
(growling)

36:18.777 --> 36:22.879
Don't worry,
no more tests for now.

36:22.881 --> 36:26.049
They haven't taught us
anything yet anyway.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.351
And I guess we'll see
what surprises

36:28.353 --> 36:30.287
a certain someone has in store

36:30.289 --> 36:32.355
for us both tomorrow morning.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.961
We were never supposed to meet.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.197
Did you know that?

36:40.199 --> 36:43.333
Pilcher thought
we would wake up,

36:43.335 --> 36:45.702
and, yes, you'd have been here,

36:45.704 --> 36:47.737
but you would be gone,

36:47.739 --> 36:52.642
and the Earth
would belong to us again.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.882
I remember waking up
on a gurney in a hospital.

37:02.654 --> 37:06.223
After I'd been attacked...

37:06.225 --> 37:08.725
and trampled...

37:08.727 --> 37:10.493
and left for dead.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.496
Before my husband died.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.500
He tried to put me
back together again.

37:17.502 --> 37:20.937
(sighs deeply)

37:20.939 --> 37:23.673
I miss him.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.309
You see? I can still
feel some things.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.281
Why am I talking to you?

37:31.283 --> 37:32.582
You can't understand me,
can you?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.118
You're just an animal.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.588
Aren't you, Margaret?

37:55.607 --> 37:57.207
HASSLER:
I can go.

37:57.209 --> 37:58.942
No, it's fine.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.955
I was remembering
the day that Ben was born.

38:13.725 --> 38:17.394
And he came out...

38:17.396 --> 38:18.962
screaming.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.831
And he looked right at me...

38:25.570 --> 38:28.571
...and he took
his little, tiny...

38:28.573 --> 38:31.408
palm and he just smacked me

38:31.410 --> 38:33.677
right in the cheek.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.579
(chuckles)

38:36.581 --> 38:38.181
It was the first thing he did.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.823
(crying):
I can't stop thinking about him

38:46.825 --> 38:49.826
being out here alone
and so scared.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.401
No mother should ever
have to outlive her child.

39:05.444 --> 39:08.178
(sighs)

39:10.649 --> 39:13.016
I know why you don't want
to return to Wayward Pines.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.121
You're out here
'cause you want to die.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.690
And I've been there.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.325
Every day I would just say,

39:22.327 --> 39:23.460
"This is it.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.861
This is how it ends."

39:24.863 --> 39:26.796
But I made peace with it.

39:26.798 --> 39:29.966
I don't have any more questions.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.335
I said everything

39:32.337 --> 39:34.971
that I was meant to say
in coming back.

39:34.973 --> 39:38.641
I just want you
to forgive me.

39:38.643 --> 39:42.145
We're all out here
stuck together.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.380
I can talk to you,

39:43.382 --> 39:46.216
I can do that.

39:46.218 --> 39:51.988
But I will never ever
be able to forgive you.

Hi, I'm Xander.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.416
I need you to come with me.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.762
I don't understand.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.033
I know.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.503
It's all very confusing.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.107
You were knocked unconscious
during the storm.

41:56.314 --> 41:58.348
It'll all make sense soon.

41:58.350 --> 41:59.616
I promise.
