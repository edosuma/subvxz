MY PARENTS ARE POOR.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.212
HEY, WILL YOU QUIT
SAYING THAT?
WE'RE NOT POOR.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.181
DAD IS GONNA FREAK
WHEN HE SEES HIS CAR.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.548
OK, WE'LL DEAL WITH

00:14.582 --> 00:15.683
RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA

00:15.716 --> 00:18.086

03:19.700 --> 03:20.801
OH, GOD, WALT,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.237
WE WERE JUST LOOKING

ARE WE POOR?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.610

03:29.643 --> 03:31.245
I COULD HAVE GONE
TO BILLY MILLER'S
PARTY TODAY.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.246
HIS PARENTS AREN'T POOR.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.815
ENOUGH TALK
ABOUT WHO'S POOR.

03:34.848 --> 03:35.716
I'M HOT!

03:35.749 --> 03:37.351
RELAX, EVERYBODY,
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE

03:37.385 --> 03:38.452

03:47.395 --> 03:49.463
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A NEW YORK
KIND OF THING TO DO.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.831
YEAH, WE SAW IT

03:50.864 --> 03:52.966
THEY WERE POOR KIDS,
DURING A RIOT.

MR. AND MRS. FINNERTY,

WITHOUT A SPRINKLER CAP
IS ILLEGAL.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.822
YEAH, SO I'M TOLD.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.857
GET IN THE CAR,
GET IN THE CAR!

04:16.890 --> 04:21.729
Police loudspeaker:
SIR, PLEASE STEP AWAY
FROM THE FIRE HYDRANT.

04:22.563 --> 04:25.065
THAT TICKET COST ME
175 BUCKS.

04:25.098 --> 04:29.337
MAN, YOU COULD GET 10 KIDS
AT THE SPLASHVILLE FOR THAT.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.071
WHY ARE YOU
STILL IN MY HOUSE?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.105
WHY ARE YOU SO SUSPICIOUS?

04:32.139 --> 04:34.708
WHY ARE YOU ANSWERING
MY QUESTIONS WITH QUESTIONS?

04:34.742 --> 04:35.576
WHY DOES THAT
CONCERN YOU?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.745
OH, GEE, I DON'T KNOW.
LET ME THINK. HMM.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.681

05:00.834 --> 05:01.702
I KNEW IT.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.504
GREGORY, PAY UP.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.742
THAT WAS A GAMBLERS
ANONYMOUS MEETING.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.911
THERE WAS
A ROULETTE WHEEL.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.447
WE'RE A VERY
LIBERAL CHAPTER.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.517
LOOK, MAN, YOU TURNED
MY HOUSE INTO THE TROPICANA.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.317

05:17.351 --> 05:18.986
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

05:19.019 --> 05:22.523
TO COVER THE CHAIR

I HAD A SMALL EMERGENCY.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.364
HOW SMALL?

06:04.398 --> 06:06.867
DID IT INVOLVE
THROWING UP IN MY CAR?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.736
NO. EEW.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.670

07:27.080 --> 07:31.218
BUT I DON'T HAVE
A CREDIT CARD!

07:31.251 --> 07:33.921
OK, MAYBE I WAS BEING
A LITTLE DRAMATIC,

07:33.954 --> 07:35.889
BUT IF LILY HADN'T HAD
THE CREDIT CARD,

07:35.923 --> 07:38.158
SHE WOULD STILL BE
IN TROUBLE NOW, RIGHT, LIL?

07:38.191 --> 07:40.127
YES.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.996
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY, RIGHT?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.498
OH, IT WAS.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.134

07:58.111 --> 08:02.650

THE LORD OF THE FLIES
OUT THERE.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.184

08:29.977 --> 08:31.945
WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.747
OH, IT'S COOL.

08:33.781 --> 08:34.715
"IT'S COOL"
IS NOT AN ANSWER, OK?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.283
"IT'S COOL" DOESN'T TELL ME
WHAT'S IN THE BOX.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.952
YES, IT DOES.
IT TELLS YOU IT'S COOL.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.988
IS IT ILLEGAL?

08:41.021 --> 08:41.955
MM...

08:41.989 --> 08:44.091
NO, NOT EVERYWHERE.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.927
CAN IT EXPLODE AND KILL
MY ENTIRE FAMILY?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.697
I CAN PERSONALLY GUARANTEE YOU
THAT IT WILL NOT.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.932
WHOA, WHOA.
THAT'S NOT SMART.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.234
WILL YOU JUST GET IT
OUT OF MY HOUSE, MAN.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.737
YEAH. HI.
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.639
YEAH. ONE SECOND, BABE.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.240
EXCUSE ME, ROCHELLE?

09:00.273 --> 09:01.341
YEAH, YEAH, NO.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.309
NO, UM, YOU SEE,

09:02.342 --> 09:04.745
I DO NOT WANT
TO GIVE YOU
MY ACCOUNT NUMBER.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.046
OK? AND I SHALL TELL YOU WHY.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.048
BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY
PUNCHED IT IN 3 TIMES,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.117
AND I'VE GIVEN IT
TO 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

09:10.150 --> 09:11.118
INCLUDING A BETH,
A JULIO,

09:11.151 --> 09:14.722
AND A GUY WHO WAS REALLY
RUDE TO ME NAMED KEVIN.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.356
OK? AND I THINK I SPEAK
FOR ALL AMERICANS

09:16.389 --> 09:18.826
WHEN I SAY WE'RE SICK
OF CALLING SOMETHING UP

09:18.859 --> 09:20.994
AND THEN KEYING IN
A NUMBER AND THEN
GETTING A VOICE

09:21.028 --> 09:23.931
AND THEM ASKING US
IMMEDIATELY WHAT
THE NUMBER WAS

09:23.964 --> 09:25.065
THAT WE KEYED IN BEFORE!

09:25.098 --> 09:26.299
AND THEN THEY TRANSFER US
TO SOMEONE ELSE

09:26.333 --> 09:28.769
AND THEN THEY ASK US
WHAT THE NUMBER WAS,

09:28.802 --> 09:30.037
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
THEY CUT YOU OFF

09:30.070 --> 09:32.673
AND YOU HAVE TO CALL BACK
AND START FROM THE START,
ALL RIGHT?

09:32.706 --> 09:36.043
SO WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE
JUST GET A PIECE OF PAPER--
YOU HEARD OF THAT--

09:36.076 --> 09:39.880
AND A PEN AND WRITE
THE DAMN NUMBERS DOWN!

09:39.913 --> 09:41.915
'CAUSE I'M SICK OF IT!

09:41.949 --> 09:45.252
YES! YES, I WOULD LIKE
TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR,

09:45.285 --> 09:46.654
THANK YOU.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.721
IT WAS LILY!

09:47.755 --> 09:49.089
I'M SORRY?

09:49.122 --> 09:53.126
LILY USED THE CREDIT CARD.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.162
LILY?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.397
OH. OH, HELLO?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.398
YEAH. YEAH,
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.202
SEE, I THOUGHT
I PUT MY WALLET DOWN
AND I MIS--

10:02.235 --> 10:04.705
OH, THERE IT IS.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.045
PLEASE TELL ME
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.715
VERY POSSIBLY.
DEFINITELY.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.718
TRUST ME.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.319
IT WAS.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.122
OH, MY GOD.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.056
WHAT?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.257
DON'T LOOK!

10:24.291 --> 10:26.994
WHO IS IT?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.662

10:42.843 --> 10:45.112
FINNERTY.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.680
PIRAMATI.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.115
WHAT'S UP?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.149
NOTHING.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.150
UH...

10:50.183 --> 10:51.985
GLIS.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.888
WAIT A MINUTE.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.890
DID YOU JUST SAY GLIS?

10:56.924 --> 10:58.759
YEAH. WHAT'S UP WITH GLIS?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.127
I DIDN'T SAY GLIS.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.396
YEAH, YOU DID.
WE ALL HEARD YOU.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.334
OH, I WAS MORTIFIED.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.739
WHY? GLIS IS A PERFECTLY
ACCEPTABLE WORD.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.240
IT'S SHORT FOR GLISSANDO.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.843
THAT'S WHEN YOU TAKE
THE BACK OF YOUR FINGER

11:15.876 --> 11:18.178
AND RUN IT ALONG
THE PIANO KEYS.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.782
YES, I WAS TALKING
TO YOU ALSO.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.184
OK, SO WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT, OK?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.053
SO, LIKE, YOU SAY,

11:26.086 --> 11:26.754
OK? AND HE SAYS,

11:26.787 --> 11:28.221
"OH, MY GOD,
DID YOU SAY GLIS?"

11:28.255 --> 11:30.057
AND THEN SHE SAID,
"WE ALL HEARD YOU
SAY GLIS."

11:30.090 --> 11:35.362
AND THEM I'M, LIKE, UH,

WITH MY CREDIT CARD?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.865

11:37.898 --> 11:40.233
IN ANY EVENT,
THAT'S A NICE SHIRT.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.936
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A BUG?

11:42.970 --> 11:44.271
NO, UH...

11:44.304 --> 11:46.239
I THINK IT'S A KITTY.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.110
RIGHT, SO,
TRACY, ALLISON,

11:50.143 --> 11:53.180
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME TO

12:05.458 --> 12:07.327
GLIS.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.798
OHH...

12:10.831 --> 12:12.099
OH, MY GOD,

12:12.132 --> 12:14.334
HE THINKS
I'M BRAIN DAMAGED.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.269
NO. HE LIKES YOU.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.037
WELL...

12:17.070 --> 12:19.239
THIS SHIRT'S ALL RIGHT,
ISN'T IT?

12:19.272 --> 12:19.940
I DON'T KNOW.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.408
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING
TO WEAR IT

12:21.441 --> 12:23.243
TO THE PARTY TONIGHT,
ARE YOU?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.212
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.014
WHAT?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.249
WHAT?!

12:29.549 --> 12:31.952
OH, GOD.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.987
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.856
IT'S COOL.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.358
DELICIOUS.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.880
CASH OR CHARGE?

12:59.913 --> 13:03.183
CHARGE.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.325
YOUNG LADY, FOLLOW ME.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.093
WHY?

13:13.126 --> 13:16.096
I WANT YOU TO LOOK OUT
THIS WINDOW.

13:16.129 --> 13:16.796
OH, OK.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.099
ALL RIGHT,
SHE'S COMIN' AROUND.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.302
I THINK IT'S
THE BIRTHDAY BOY'S TURN.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.503
COME ON, HENRY.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.972
HERE IT COMES!

13:25.005 --> 13:27.240
WHOO-HOO.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.043
GET READY.

13:30.077 --> 13:33.146
I DON'T WANNA GO!

13:33.180 --> 13:35.949
OH, YOU'RE GOIN'.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.085
HERE IT COMES!

13:38.118 --> 13:39.152
GRANDPA...

13:39.186 --> 13:40.187
IT STINKS.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.022
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
PRESSURE PROBLEM.

13:42.055 --> 13:46.126
NOBODY FLUSH THE TOILET
UNTIL THE PARTY'S OVER!

13:46.159 --> 13:47.494
ALL RIGHT?

13:47.527 --> 13:48.996
HERE WE GO.

13:49.029 --> 13:49.696
READY...

13:49.729 --> 13:52.432
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
LITTLE HENRY.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.601
HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S HAVING AN OK TIME.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.870
OH, YEAH, SURE,
AND WHY SHOULDN'T HE?

13:56.904 --> 13:58.371
HEY, IT WAS
A GREAT DAY.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.539
WASN'T IT, BABY?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.408
IT--IT WAS OK.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.075
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.

14:02.109 --> 14:06.113
IT WAS A FREAKIN'
DISASTER.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.115
WHOO!

14:08.148 --> 14:09.983
HEY, GUYS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

14:10.017 --> 14:12.152
ABOUT THE TUNNEL
OF ADVENTURE?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.121
IT'S A CAR WASH.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.422
I'M HOT!

14:15.455 --> 14:16.423
WHOOO!

14:16.456 --> 14:17.925
MR. AND MRS. FINNERTY,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.226
I REALLY DON'T FEEL GOOD.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.095
ALL RIGHT, JUST HOLD ON
THERE, PERRY.

14:22.129 --> 14:22.930
IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.465
OH, MAN, IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GONNA RUFE.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.134
OH, N-N-NOT IN THE CAR.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.101
NO! NO!

14:29.169 --> 14:31.905
OHH!
EEW!
OHH!

14:31.939 --> 14:33.106
OHH, YUCK!

14:34.975 --> 14:36.009
DO SOMETHING!

14:36.043 --> 14:39.913
* THE WHEELS ON THE BUS
GO ROUND, ROUND, ROUND... *

14:40.580 --> 14:42.649
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

14:45.485 --> 14:48.055
OK. OK, LOOK,
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID,

14:48.088 --> 14:49.289
BUT YOU CAN'T
HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE

14:49.322 --> 14:52.125
FOR SOME KID PUKING
IN GRANDPA'S CAR.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.994
PLEASE,
ALLOW ME TO TRY.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.395
COME ON, SEAN,

14:55.428 --> 14:56.463
IT WAS ONE BLOUSE.

14:56.496 --> 15:00.067
IT WAS BIG PARTY
AT A HOT GUY'S HOUSE.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.068
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:01.101 --> 15:06.173
ONE BLOUSE WOULD NOT
PUT OUR CARD OVER THE LIMIT.

15:07.207 --> 15:11.044
OK, I--IT WASN'T JUST
THE BLOUSE.

15:12.145 --> 15:12.980
WHAT?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.047
I HAD A PLAN.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.315
REALLY, I--I DID.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.550
NOW, HOLD ON
TO YOUR RECEIPT,

15:17.584 --> 15:20.087
JUST IN CASE YOU
NEED TO RETURN THESE.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.621
RIGHT.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.056
I'LL DO THAT.

15:23.090 --> 15:27.227
I CAN RETURN THESE
IF I HAVE TO, RIGHT?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.228
OF COURSE.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.197
FOR A FULL REFUND,
RIGHT?

15:30.230 --> 15:31.364
OH, SURE.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.599
NO QUESTIONS ASKED?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.101
NOPE.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.636
LIL, YOU'RE KILLIN' ME!

15:36.669 --> 15:38.405
I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW,

15:38.438 --> 15:39.506
I--I READ SOMEWHERE

15:39.539 --> 15:42.075
THAT COMPULSIVE SHOPPING
IS A DISEASE.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.710
A DISEASE.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.611
NO, NO, NO.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.080
CHOLERA IS A DISEASE, OK?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.615
SHOPPING IS WHAT
A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL DOES

15:48.648 --> 15:50.717
WHO WANTS TO LOOK CUTE
FOR THE BOYS

15:50.750 --> 15:54.487
WHEN SOMEBODY
GIVES HER A CREDIT CARD.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.526
IS THIS A PRESENT
FOR HENRY?

15:59.559 --> 16:00.193
NO.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.428
NO, THAT'S SOMETHING
OF MINE.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.496
WH

16:03.530 --> 16:05.098
I'M JUST A MAN
WITH A BOX.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.634
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.037
WEREN'T YOU TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING, LILY,

16:10.070 --> 16:11.171
LIKE, ABOUT CLOTHES

16:11.204 --> 16:12.239
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.273
SHE WAS TELLING US

16:13.306 --> 16:14.774
ABOUT HER FABULOUS
NEW WARDROBE.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.310
OH, DAD, I WAS SO CAREFUL,
I WAS NEUROTIC.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.247
I WASN'T GOING TO LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN
TO THOSE CLOTHES.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.317
* TAKE THIS PINK RIBBON
OFF MY EYES *

16:24.351 --> 16:28.421
* I'M EXPOSED
AND IT'S NO BIG SURPRISE *

16:28.455 --> 16:29.256
AAH!

16:29.289 --> 16:30.523
* DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW

16:30.557 --> 16:32.559
* EXACTLY WHERE I AM

16:32.592 --> 16:33.726
I'M SO SORRY.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.694
AAH!

16:34.727 --> 16:39.199
* EVERYONE IS FORCIN' ME
TO HOLD YOUR HAND *

16:39.232 --> 16:42.669
* OH, I'M JUST A GIRL...

16:44.171 --> 16:45.338
IT'S GLIS.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.174
HI, DEAN.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.409
YOU'RE LOOKING
SPECIAL, FINNERTY.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.211
THANKS.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.479
YOU WANT TO, UH...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.614
YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT
MY BACKYARD?

16:54.647 --> 16:56.683
OK.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.194
* THE MOMENT
THAT I STEPPED OUTSIDE... *

17:07.227 --> 17:09.362
YOU LOOK HOT,
FINNERTY.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.231
THANKS.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.732
* ...FOR ME TO RUN AND HIDE

17:12.765 --> 17:16.203
* I CAN'T DO
THE LITTLE THINGS... *

17:16.236 --> 17:17.270
MM--MM--

17:17.304 --> 17:19.206
ARE YOUR HANDS CLEAN?

17:19.239 --> 17:19.939
WHAT?

17:19.972 --> 17:21.274
I SAW YOU EATING
NACHOS EARLIER,

17:21.308 --> 17:23.710
AND I THOUGHT
THEY MIGHT BE GREASY.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.246
OK.
ALL RIGHT.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.747
MM...

17:29.282 --> 17:30.250
MM! THE CHAIRS!

17:30.283 --> 17:30.950
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.552
DO YOU TAKE THEM IN
AT NIGHT?

17:32.585 --> 17:33.653
NOT USUALLY, NO.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.322
THEN THEY'RE
PROBABLY FILTHY.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.190
LET'S JUST STAND UP.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.558
ALL RIGHT.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.462
MM...

17:42.495 --> 17:44.264
AND NOT USE OUR HANDS?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.499
I TOLD YOU,
THEY'RE CLEAN.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.202
OH, HANG ON.

17:52.639 --> 17:53.306
WHAT, ARE YOU

17:53.340 --> 17:56.109
GETTING READY
TO HAVE LOBSTER?

17:56.143 --> 17:58.411
BETTER.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.254
SEE, I THOUGHT WHAT
YOU WERE TELLING ME

18:07.287 --> 18:08.521
WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME
LESS UPSET.

18:08.555 --> 18:12.325
DAD, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO SHOW YOU
HOW RESPONSIBLE I WAS BEING.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.494
OH, WELL, NEXT TIME
YOU SHOULD JUST
STRIP NAKED

18:14.527 --> 18:17.530
AND PUT YOUR CLOTHES
IN A PLASTIC BAG.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.332
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND
NEXT TIME.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.868
OK, YOU'RE TAKING
THOSE CLOTHES BACK
RIGHT NOW.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.836
WELL, GREAT.
I ALREADY DID.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.538
NOT REALLY.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.775
HI. I'D LIKE TO RETURN...

18:29.376 --> 18:30.410
ALL OF THESE.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.412
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR RECEIPTS?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.746
YES, I DO.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.483
OK.

18:39.852 --> 18:40.787

18:41.921 --> 18:43.423
WHAT'S THIS?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.291
A STORE CREDIT SLIP.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.260
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL TAKE CASH.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.463
OH, SORRY.
IT'S OUR POLICY.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.604
OH, DEAR GOD, NO.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.305
HI.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.273
THAT SWEATER
IS SO YOUR COLOR.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.541
YOU HAVE TO GET IT.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.609
OH, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.345
WHY DON'T I USE
MY STORE CREDIT
TO BUY IT FOR YOU,

19:05.378 --> 19:08.848
AND YOU CAN GIVE ME
THE CASH.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.016
IT'S LIKE
A TRAVELER'S CHECK.

19:10.049 --> 19:13.653
AND IF YOU ACT NOW,
I'LL THROW IN
SOME EXTRA STOCKINGS,

19:13.686 --> 19:15.388

OH, YEAH?

19:20.293 --> 19:22.662
WELL, YOU'RE TOO OLD
FOR A JEANS SKIRT.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.399
IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE
A HOOKER!

19:27.400 --> 19:30.403
WELL, I GOTTA
HAND IT TO YOU.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.338
OK, SHUT UP.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.171
NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.207
I'M JUST GLAD
SHE HAD THAT CREDIT CARD

19:34.241 --> 19:35.408
FOR WHEN SHE NEEDED IT.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.376
SHUT UP.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.411
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
THAT MY LITTLE BABY
IS OK.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.679
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.813
I WANT YOU TO SHUT UP!

19:40.847 --> 19:44.317
ALL RIGHT, LILY,
DID THAT STORE HAVE
A TOY DEPARTMENT?

19:44.351 --> 19:45.585

20:04.371 --> 20:05.505
OK. GREAT.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.373

20:06.406 --> 20:07.374

20:09.542 --> 20:11.578
