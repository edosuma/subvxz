WEBVTT

00:05.977 --> 00:10.050
Only one creature
has carved a life for itself

00:10.097 --> 00:11.974
in every habitat on earth.

00:13.057 --> 00:16.413
That creature is us.

00:18.537 --> 00:24.487
All over the world, we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

00:24.537 --> 00:30.089
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.137 --> 00:34.254
This is the Human Planet.

00:46.017 --> 00:50.056
The sea covers 70%
of our planet's surface.

00:51.217 --> 00:55.654
It's home to three-quarters
of all life on earth.

01:02.857 --> 01:08.136
All the creatures found here are perfectly
adapted to thrive in the ocean...

01:10.577 --> 01:12.807
...all except one.

01:31.017 --> 01:33.611
We are not evolved for a life aquatic...

01:35.577 --> 01:40.128
...and we're way out of our depth
in this dangerous and alien world.

01:47.537 --> 01:51.974
But great opportunities await those people
who dare to venture into the water.

01:55.257 --> 01:59.455
As we immerse ourselves
ever deeper in the big blue,

01:59.497 --> 02:03.410
how do we overcome
the enormous challenges that confront us?

02:33.297 --> 02:37.176
Our relationship with the ocean
begins on the coast.

02:38.257 --> 02:42.330
Even here,
the sea is a force to be reckoned with.

02:45.857 --> 02:47.973
Galicia, in Northern Spain, is home

02:48.017 --> 02:52.135
to one of Europe's
most treacherous coasts.

02:54.017 --> 02:58.010
But the more extreme the conditions,
the greater the rewards,

02:58.057 --> 03:02.608
if, like Javier and Angel,
you're prepared to take the risk.

03:20.497 --> 03:24.126
Javier and Angel are on the hunt
for a strange creature

03:24.177 --> 03:27.806
that clings to the wave-battered rocks...

03:27.857 --> 03:30.496
at the bottom of these cliffs.

03:43.617 --> 03:48.008
They have to move fast.
Their quarry is only exposed at low tide.

03:54.257 --> 03:56.088
Vamos! Arriba! Arriba!

04:18.297 --> 04:21.175
It's goose barnacles they're after,

04:21.217 --> 04:25.733
a highly prized delicacy
that can sell for 200 euros a kilo.

04:26.457 --> 04:31.929
But it's not easy pickings.
Each year, about five collectors die.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.650
Few dare work when it's this rough.

04:35.697 --> 04:39.770
But those who do can charge
a premium for their harvest.

04:51.257 --> 04:55.136
Despite the onslaught,
Javier's filled his bag.

04:56.417 --> 05:00.376
Now it's Angel's turn,
and though it's getting even rougher...

05:04.177 --> 05:06.407
...he's going in with no safety rope.

05:13.177 --> 05:16.726
Working unattached
allows him to dash between waves

05:16.777 --> 05:20.770
and reach the lowest rocks,
where the biggest barnacles grow.

05:21.657 --> 05:24.774
But one slip could be fatal.

05:32.697 --> 05:36.451
Although the tide's coming in,
Angel's determined to collect more.

06:04.297 --> 06:07.414
Javier and Angel's gamble paid off.

06:07.457 --> 06:11.245
In two hours, they've gathered
enough goose barnacles

06:11.297 --> 06:16.166
to fetch around 800 euros.
Not bad for a day at the seaside.

06:26.977 --> 06:32.131
It's this abundance of food
that entices us into the waves.

06:32.177 --> 06:36.693
And just a little further out,
there are even greater riches.

06:39.217 --> 06:42.812
Coastal waters account forjust
one-tenth of the world's oceans,

06:42.857 --> 06:46.327
but they're home
to the vast majority of marine life.

06:51.857 --> 06:56.692
The trouble is, as we venture further
from the shore, the dangers escalate.

07:01.137 --> 07:03.856
Benjamin's training to be a harpoonist

07:03.897 --> 07:08.368
and he knows, any day now,
all he's learned could be put to the test.

07:26.497 --> 07:31.776
He lives on a small Indonesian island
called Lembata.

07:31.817 --> 07:34.285
Few crops grow in this rocky land,

07:34.337 --> 07:37.773
and even surviving from the sea
is a struggle.

07:40.977 --> 07:43.127
But there's one animal they wait for

07:43.177 --> 07:46.249
that can dramatically change
their fortunes.

08:03.217 --> 08:06.846
The whole village springs into action.

08:22.537 --> 08:25.051
It's a race against time
to get out to sea.

08:41.057 --> 08:43.446
Benjamin and the rest of the crew

08:43.497 --> 08:47.012
are about to take on
the biggest predator that's ever lived.

08:59.057 --> 09:00.888
They all know the risks,

09:00.937 --> 09:04.612
but opportunities don't come
much bigger than this.

09:06.617 --> 09:08.926
The sperm whale.

09:10.937 --> 09:16.375
Up to 1 8 metres long, these mighty
leviathans are powerful animals

09:16.417 --> 09:18.851
and they won't go down without a fight.

09:27.657 --> 09:30.171
With simple wooden boats
and handmade weapons,

09:30.217 --> 09:36.053
the whalers seem ill-prepared for battle,
but this is how it's been for 600 years.

09:37.817 --> 09:42.288
They can only harpoon the whale
when it surfaces to breathe...

09:44.097 --> 09:45.769
...so they need to move fast.

09:54.857 --> 09:58.770
Benjamin's brother prepares
to launch himself at the whale.

09:59.777 --> 10:02.689
This is the most dangerous moment of all.

10:09.457 --> 10:11.527
But he misses,

10:14.017 --> 10:17.612
and now someone else must step up
before the whale dives.

10:20.337 --> 10:22.692
Benjamin's moment has arrived.

10:43.137 --> 10:45.412
He's got it.

10:49.297 --> 10:52.687
But the battle has just begun.

10:56.257 --> 11:01.126
As the whale fights to break free,
they move to harpoon it again.

11:07.177 --> 11:10.613
They need to prevent it from diving
and pulling a boat under.

11:18.257 --> 11:21.169
But it's not enough.

11:24.497 --> 11:29.332
Terrified of the thrashing whale,
the crew scramble to safety.

11:40.377 --> 11:44.290
Another boat attacks
and harpoons the whale once more.

11:53.897 --> 11:59.290
Now dragging several boats,
the whale slowly tires.

12:11.977 --> 12:14.730
Eventually, its struggles are exhausted

12:14.777 --> 12:18.816
and a final cut, through its backbone,
is made.

12:34.937 --> 12:38.612
It's been an epic eight-hour battle,

12:38.657 --> 12:42.536
but Benjamin has shown his skill
and bravery...

12:47.217 --> 12:51.130
...and this time everyone returns
safely home.

12:53.897 --> 12:59.688
The death of a whale may be sad to us,
but this is their lifeline.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.695
One catch can feed a village for months,

13:02.737 --> 13:06.013
and this small-scale hunt in Lembata

13:06.057 --> 13:09.766
doesn't threaten whale numbers
in these oceans.

13:09.817 --> 13:13.173
They only take around six whales a year.

13:14.977 --> 13:19.493
Nothing is wasted. The meat is shared out.

13:19.537 --> 13:24.736
As the man who dealt the decisive blow,
Benjamin gets a larger share,

13:25.897 --> 13:30.368
and for a while at least,
his family won't be going hungry.

13:36.577 --> 13:39.250
Although we've evolved for a life on land,

13:39.297 --> 13:43.495
we've become
remarkably efficient oceanic hunters.

13:47.137 --> 13:49.935
Adaptability is the secret of our success

13:49.977 --> 13:53.014
at discovering new ways
to exploit the ocean.

13:58.817 --> 14:04.892
And in a few special places, this means
working with the creatures of the sea.

14:11.817 --> 14:14.456
These fishermen of Laguna in Brazil

14:14.497 --> 14:17.569
have forged one of the most
extraordinary partnerships

14:17.617 --> 14:21.895
between humans and wild animals
found anywhere on earth.

14:26.137 --> 14:30.096
Edson is up early
to fish the large numbers of mullet

14:30.137 --> 14:34.415
that migrate through these waters
every May.

14:35.537 --> 14:37.334
But there's a problem.

14:37.377 --> 14:43.134
The water's so murky, the fishermen
can't see where to cast their nets.

14:45.097 --> 14:51.332
So, they join forces with
the most intelligent animal in the sea.

14:51.377 --> 14:56.167
But, like all relationships,
a certain amount of patience is required.

15:05.497 --> 15:08.694
Finally, their friends surface.

15:11.737 --> 15:16.049
The local bottlenose dolphins
are celebrities in Laguna.

15:16.097 --> 15:22.127
In fact, Edson and his pal Alfredo
know each one by name.

15:29.577 --> 15:35.812
Incredibly, the dolphins drive the mullet
towards the fishermen,

15:35.857 --> 15:41.295
and even signal when to cast their nets,
with these distinctive dives.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.288
The fishermen say they can tell
the size of the school,

16:01.337 --> 16:03.771
and which way it's travelling,

16:03.817 --> 16:06.536
from the vigour and direction of the dive.

16:13.057 --> 16:16.527
The dolphins do the hard work,
herding the mullet.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.569
The fish are served
to the fishermen on a plate...

16:25.017 --> 16:29.295
...but what the dolphins stand to gain
is less clear.

16:29.337 --> 16:31.487
Since they detect prey by echolocation,

16:31.537 --> 16:34.210
they have no problem
hunting in the murky water,

16:34.257 --> 16:38.250
but picking off individuals
from the school is more difficult.

16:39.297 --> 16:43.210
It seems the nets panic the fish
into breaking formation,

16:43.257 --> 16:47.045
making them much easier
for the dolphins to chase down.

17:00.777 --> 17:07.091
As the nets are hauled in,
the benefits of teamwork are revealed.

17:13.337 --> 17:15.976
Edson and the other fishermen
have no doubt

17:16.017 --> 17:17.973
how much the dolphins help them.

17:54.817 --> 18:00.687
No matter how we catch it,
seafood is vital to human survival,

18:00.737 --> 18:06.016
providing the main source of protein
for about half the world's population.

18:11.057 --> 18:15.972
But there's a lot more to our ancient
connection with the sea than just food.

18:18.537 --> 18:21.097
The more we've come to depend
on the ocean,

18:21.137 --> 18:24.209
and the further we've pushed
into its vast frontier,

18:24.257 --> 18:28.216
the greater its influence
has become in our lives.

18:33.017 --> 18:36.692
The Pacific covers one-third of the globe.

18:40.457 --> 18:43.051
The tiny specks of land
in the middle of it

18:43.097 --> 18:46.931
are about as remote as life can get
for a human being.

18:59.337 --> 19:01.373
With so few options on land,

19:01.417 --> 19:07.731
the surrounding ocean underpins almost
every aspect of life on a Pacific island.

19:18.857 --> 19:22.452
Over 3,000 kilometres
from the nearest continent,

19:22.497 --> 19:26.331
Hawaii is one of the most isolated of all.

19:28.657 --> 19:34.732
There are few places where the sea has had
a greater impact on human existence.

19:50.177 --> 19:54.170
The ocean, significantly to us,
it's...it's our home.

19:54.217 --> 20:00.133
Our connection is so great,
we look at it as our origin.

20:00.177 --> 20:04.887
The water is who we are, and the water
is our mother, our father, our gods.

20:07.697 --> 20:11.895
For Tom "Pohako"Stone,
displaying his skill in the ocean

20:11.937 --> 20:15.646
is a central part of what it means
to be Hawaiian.

20:22.057 --> 20:24.491
Sliding on waves, as it was known,

20:24.537 --> 20:27.370
has been practised
by the Polynesians for millennia.

20:27.417 --> 20:32.332
But it was around 1,000 years ago,
when they arrived in Hawaii,

20:32.377 --> 20:34.413
that it evolved into surfing.

20:34.457 --> 20:39.929
When we actually learned
that we could construct boards

20:39.977 --> 20:42.366
to stand up and surf a wave,

20:42.417 --> 20:47.491
it became a very ritualistic component
of our culture.

20:49.857 --> 20:56.171
Far more than just a sport, surfing was
a sacred art form for Tom's ancestors.

20:56.217 --> 20:58.572
It was a core part of their society,

20:58.617 --> 21:04.328
and the noble pursuit
of warriors, kings and queens.

21:09.457 --> 21:13.735
We have a lot of history
about women that...that surf,

21:13.777 --> 21:18.293
and, you know, they surfed so well
that they actually reached godly status.

21:23.617 --> 21:26.211
We revered these women.

21:37.097 --> 21:40.692
From ancient origins,
surfing has now gone global.

21:41.777 --> 21:45.167
And for some,
searching for the ride of your life

21:45.217 --> 21:47.526
has become an extreme obsession.

21:55.217 --> 21:58.334
December 9th, 2009.

21:58.377 --> 22:01.574
The world's surfing elite
has gathered in Hawaii,

22:01.617 --> 22:06.327
to ride some of the biggest swells
to hit these shores in over a decade.

22:25.457 --> 22:30.053
Surfing's certainly changed,
but for many it's still a way of life,

22:30.097 --> 22:33.453
and the best riders are still
revered as gods

22:33.497 --> 22:36.455
amongst the worldwide surfing tribe.

22:47.577 --> 22:51.650
With waves over 1 5 metres,
five storeys high,

22:51.697 --> 22:55.326
this is a real test of skill and stamina.

23:20.137 --> 23:24.210
Ken Bradshaw is famed
for taming a 26-metre wave,

23:24.257 --> 23:27.135
probably the biggest ever ridden.

23:27.177 --> 23:32.171
But these unpredictable swells
can claim even the most seasoned surfer.

23:54.137 --> 23:57.015
Trapped in a rolling mountain
of white water,

23:57.057 --> 24:01.209
Ken is tossed around like a rag doll
in a washing machine.

24:04.097 --> 24:08.887
Just as he surfaces,
another giant breaker comes crashing in.

24:27.137 --> 24:30.925
After a relentless pounding
from six successive waves,

24:30.977 --> 24:34.856
Ken eventually escapes in one piece.

24:39.417 --> 24:42.329
All big wave surfers know the risks,

24:42.377 --> 24:46.211
but the adrenaline and the glory
is addictive.

24:48.017 --> 24:51.054
And just as the ancient Hawaiians
discovered,

24:51.097 --> 24:54.885
surfing is still the most
spectacular demonstration

24:54.937 --> 24:57.895
of our ability to conquer the waves.

25:56.217 --> 26:02.008
Our mastery of the sea is impressive,
but we'll never tame its full fury.

26:04.617 --> 26:07.131
The enormous waves of December 9th

26:07.177 --> 26:12.012
were created by intense
tropical cyclone activity in the Pacific.

26:14.497 --> 26:19.287
When warm waters fuel the ferocity
of depressions over the ocean,

26:19.337 --> 26:22.932
they can create
the most violent weather systems on earth.

26:24.497 --> 26:27.534
People must stay well away
from the raging sea

26:27.577 --> 26:30.489
during these tempestuous times,

26:30.537 --> 26:32.892
but they can't stop it coming to them.

26:39.057 --> 26:44.006
These super-storms, with winds
of over 300 kilometres per hour,

26:44.057 --> 26:46.810
wreak havoc on the human world.

26:51.177 --> 26:54.726
It can take years to recover
from the destruction.

27:02.857 --> 27:06.372
Sometimes over 1,600 kilometres wide,

27:06.417 --> 27:12.492
hurricanes and typhoons are persistent
reminders of the ocean's awesome force.

27:16.417 --> 27:19.966
It's little wonder that coastal people
look at these mighty waters

27:20.017 --> 27:21.689
with great reverence...

27:23.217 --> 27:26.573
...but not just for
the power of the ocean,

27:26.617 --> 27:29.654
but also the power
of the creatures that live in it.

27:34.657 --> 27:41.654
In the islands off Papua New Guinea,
Blais is known as a sorcerer of the sea.

27:46.577 --> 27:51.128
Possessing the mysterious ability
to summon sharks from the deep,

27:51.177 --> 27:55.932
he's one of the last so-called
"shark callers';

27:55.977 --> 27:59.447
a traditional hunting technique
steeped in superstition.

28:33.457 --> 28:37.928
Blais respects ritual,
but he also understands shark behaviour.

28:37.977 --> 28:43.973
Rattling in the water
mimics the activity of feeding fish.

28:44.017 --> 28:47.646
Sharks can detect these vibrations
from three kilometres away,

28:47.697 --> 28:49.972
but they don't always respond.

29:16.217 --> 29:20.176
And as industrial fishing
decimates shark numbers,

29:20.217 --> 29:23.095
the waits are getting even longer.

29:34.697 --> 29:39.293
Finally, a grey reef shark
emerges from the blue.

29:40.577 --> 29:43.455
Blais has appeased its spirit.

29:44.977 --> 29:49.971
But now he has to catch it,
and sharks are notoriously skittish.

29:56.697 --> 29:59.973
It's a game of cat and mouse.

30:05.937 --> 30:10.135
Blais tries to entice the shark close
enough to slip a noose around its neck...

30:14.777 --> 30:18.087
...but one false move and it's game over.

30:22.977 --> 30:28.927
Finally it takes the bait.
Slowly he prepares the noose.

30:51.977 --> 30:55.686
Blais can't keep hold of
the thrashing shark,

30:55.737 --> 30:59.207
but this wooden float prevents it diving.

31:17.137 --> 31:22.336
Then, as if under a spell,
the shark suddenly stops.

31:29.217 --> 31:33.893
But in fact the float exploits
a quirk in shark biology,

31:33.937 --> 31:39.807
exhausting it so much, it enters a state
known as tonic immobility.

31:42.217 --> 31:44.606
Blais approaches with caution.

31:45.617 --> 31:50.771
The shark is still very much alive
and its bite could cause serious injury.

32:03.857 --> 32:07.816
In the past, Blais would have
killed the shark for food.

32:09.577 --> 32:12.728
But today he lets it go free.

32:15.257 --> 32:19.170
Blais is committed to keeping
his shark-calling culture alive...

32:24.257 --> 32:27.055
...and this means keeping sharks alive.

32:44.057 --> 32:48.016
And it's not just traditions
that are threatened.

32:49.617 --> 32:51.653
In some seas around the world,

32:51.697 --> 32:55.292
a growing shortage of fish
is forcing people deeper and deeper,

32:55.337 --> 32:58.329
just to land a decent catch.

32:59.377 --> 33:04.053
So deep, they venture
to the very limits of human survival.

33:09.857 --> 33:12.610
Welcome to the world
of the Pa-aling divers,

33:12.657 --> 33:16.445
perhaps the most dangerous
fishing method of all.

33:17.897 --> 33:21.014
80 men, many of whom are still teenagers,

33:21.057 --> 33:24.333
are preparing to dive to over 40 metres,

33:24.377 --> 33:30.566
breathing air pumped through these
makeshift tubes by this rusty compressor.

33:31.777 --> 33:37.454
Joseph is one of the youngest aboard,
but he's aware of the risks.

33:44.057 --> 33:48.096
He's already witnessed
just how lethal his job can be.

34:06.057 --> 34:09.811
The seas around the Philippines
were once rich with life,

34:09.857 --> 34:11.813
but they've been so over-exploited

34:11.857 --> 34:17.568
that decent fish numbers
are only found at perilous depths.

34:31.257 --> 34:36.092
The divers guide the huge ball of nets
40 metres down to the sea floor,

34:36.137 --> 34:39.493
but all the while
their air supply is at risk.

34:41.337 --> 34:43.293
Back on the boat,

34:43.337 --> 34:46.886
the ailing compressor
and the ever-worsening tangle of tubes

34:46.937 --> 34:48.450
need constant attention.

34:50.777 --> 34:55.055
Like a failing heart
pumping through clogged arteries,

34:55.097 --> 34:57.292
if this circulation system fails,

34:57.337 --> 35:01.376
at this depth, it's almost certain death.

35:08.177 --> 35:10.372
Joseph and the team unravel the nets

35:10.417 --> 35:13.011
and lay them out
by securing them to rocks.

35:26.137 --> 35:27.809
They must work fast.

35:27.857 --> 35:31.372
Joseph knows, the longer he spends
at these depths,

35:31.417 --> 35:33.487
the more dangerous it becomes.

35:33.537 --> 35:37.416
With every breath,
more nitrogen dissolves in his body,

35:37.457 --> 35:42.577
making him increasingly vulnerable
to decompression sickness - "the bends".

36:02.337 --> 36:06.615
The top of the net is suspended
by plastic containers filled with air,

36:06.657 --> 36:10.252
creating a huge cavernous trap beneath.

36:18.097 --> 36:21.646
Now it's time to set the scare-line.

36:31.737 --> 36:37.448
The boats drag the 1,000-metre line
to form a huge circle around the net,

36:37.497 --> 36:40.534
and the divers position themselves
along it.

36:43.377 --> 36:49.009
Joseph and the team begin closing
the trap by swimming towards the net.

36:49.057 --> 36:52.447
The waving streamers
and the curtain of rising bubbles

36:52.497 --> 36:55.136
panics the fish and they flee.

37:02.417 --> 37:05.409
As the line of divers tightens,
more and more fish

37:05.457 --> 37:08.574
swim straight into the gaping net.

37:14.417 --> 37:16.453
This deep-sea round-up is so effective,

37:16.497 --> 37:20.092
it can take 50% of the fish
from a reef.

37:36.017 --> 37:40.169
The net is closed, and now Joseph must do
something even more dangerous,

37:40.217 --> 37:44.813
get inside and herd the catch
to the far end.

38:03.617 --> 38:08.008
On deck, the tangled web of tubes
is getting worse.

38:26.017 --> 38:30.647
Once the catch is concentrated, the net
is released from its anchor points.

38:37.337 --> 38:40.374
Now comes the most lethal stage of all -

38:40.417 --> 38:43.853
guiding the net
as it shoots to the surface.

38:43.897 --> 38:48.573
All too often, the divers ascend
too quickly and get the bends.

39:08.057 --> 39:12.414
As the catch is hauled onto the boat,
its size is revealed.

39:14.497 --> 39:17.489
Just under a tonne of fish isn't bad,

39:17.537 --> 39:22.736
but it's nowhere near what these fishermen
were landing a few years ago.

39:23.777 --> 39:29.807
And this isn't the only problem.
Some of the crew do have the bends.

39:29.857 --> 39:33.930
One diver has returned to the bottom
to relieve the symptoms,

39:33.977 --> 39:37.174
whilst, closer to the surface,
another is massaged

39:37.217 --> 39:40.448
to release the painful bubbles
in his spine.

39:45.057 --> 39:47.571
Every day, these Pa-aling divers

39:47.617 --> 39:51.246
are taking greater risks
for dwindling rewards.

40:11.257 --> 40:13.817
Joseph has his dreams,

40:13.857 --> 40:20.774
but the harsh reality is he'll be diving
twice again today, just to make ends meet.

40:23.057 --> 40:25.412
We've become so successful in the ocean,

40:25.457 --> 40:30.292
it's predicted that in 50 years
almost all the fish could be gone...

40:33.217 --> 40:36.687
...and this may not be
the only change to come.

40:38.177 --> 40:42.056
All around the world,
sea levels are rising.

40:42.097 --> 40:46.887
Soon our planet could be
even more dominated by the ocean,

40:46.937 --> 40:51.533
and our ability to survive here
will be pushed to the very limit.

40:58.617 --> 41:03.896
Yet there are some people who've
already adapted to life in a water world.

41:08.737 --> 41:13.811
In the coral seas between Borneo,
Sulawesi and the Philippines,

41:13.857 --> 41:17.167
there are people who live
more intimately with the ocean

41:17.217 --> 41:19.173
than any other culture on earth.

41:28.897 --> 41:33.254
The Bajau Laut build their lives
in the middle of the sea,

41:33.297 --> 41:35.891
often many kilometres from land.

41:47.617 --> 41:52.247
The ocean has a profound influence
on every aspect of their existence.

41:52.297 --> 41:55.733
They even measure the passage of time
by the rhythm of the tides

41:55.777 --> 41:58.371
rather than minutes and hours.

42:06.737 --> 42:11.253
And there are some whose relationship
with the sea runs even deeper.

42:20.577 --> 42:23.216
The Bajau, who live on houseboats,

42:23.257 --> 42:27.045
have almost completely
severed their ties with the land.

42:32.017 --> 42:35.089
Nohara rarely sets foot ashore.

43:01.857 --> 43:08.296
Nohara and her family usually only
visit land to trade for rice and fuel,

43:08.337 --> 43:11.135
or to mend their boats.

43:11.177 --> 43:14.726
But, like many Bajau,
Nohara gets "land-sick"

43:14.777 --> 43:17.245
and she prefers to stay aboard.

43:19.617 --> 43:24.327
Her family has no nationality,
no fixed abode and almost no money,

43:24.377 --> 43:27.892
but the ocean provides
everything they need.

43:30.617 --> 43:34.166
They eat a bewildering variety of seafood.

43:41.377 --> 43:46.212
Her children adapt to an aquatic
way of life from a very young age.

43:50.337 --> 43:54.615
Some Bajau children
spend so much time in the sea,

43:54.657 --> 43:57.535
their eyes adjust
to focus better underwater.

44:01.097 --> 44:06.125
But there's one member of this community
whose adaptation is even more staggering.

44:09.777 --> 44:12.769
Sulbin is an underwater hunter,

44:12.817 --> 44:16.605
and the living proof of just how far
we can push our bodies

44:16.657 --> 44:18.409
towards a life aquatic.

44:41.617 --> 44:47.089
Sulbin's search for supper takes him
on a incredible journey under the waves,

44:47.137 --> 44:51.050
and his abilities
will take your breath away.

44:55.337 --> 45:00.809
First he prepares
by entering a trance-like state.

45:19.337 --> 45:26.015
Sulbin is about to push his body
almost beyond the realms of possibility,

45:26.057 --> 45:29.936
and if you want to try and join him,
get ready to hold your breath

45:29.977 --> 45:31.854
for as long as you can.

45:37.457 --> 45:40.767
He takes one last breath.

46:02.857 --> 46:08.250
Focused and calm, Sulbin descends
20 metres to the sea floor.

46:18.177 --> 46:22.295
His heartbeat slows
to around 30 beats per minute.

46:23.857 --> 46:26.894
The pressure at these depths
crushes his chest,

46:26.937 --> 46:31.692
squeezing the air in his lungs
to one-third of its usual volume,

46:35.297 --> 46:38.812
Even without weights,
he's negatively buoyant enough

46:38.857 --> 46:43.089
to stride across the bottom of the sea
as if hunting on land.

47:00.697 --> 47:04.087
By now, the carbon dioxide in his blood
causes

47:04.137 --> 47:07.493
an almost irresistible urge
to gasp for air,

47:07.537 --> 47:11.610
but Sulbin must keep his mind on the hunt.

47:20.937 --> 47:26.057
After a minute and three-quarters,
Sulbin spots a fish.

47:37.777 --> 47:44.296
Sulbin can go even deeper than this
and stay down for up to five minutes,

47:45.497 --> 47:49.615
but he's not one to show off
and, after all, he's got what he came for.

47:52.457 --> 47:58.054
Two-and-a-half minutes of hunting
under pressure on one breath.

47:58.097 --> 48:02.010
Perhaps the idea of humans
existing as marine mammals

48:02.057 --> 48:04.412
is not so far-fetched after all.

48:16.337 --> 48:19.454
Through amazing adaptability
and endeavour,

48:19.497 --> 48:22.967
we've pushed our limits of survival
into the ocean,

48:23.017 --> 48:26.896
and, as we've immersed ourselves
deeper in the sea,

48:26.937 --> 48:30.168
it's had a profound effect on our lives.

48:36.177 --> 48:41.126
But as we continue to change the nature
of the greatest environment on our planet,

48:41.177 --> 48:46.809
how we'll adapt in the future
remains to be seen.

48:58.097 --> 49:02.932
The most technical and demanding shoots
Oceans programme

49:02.977 --> 49:05.730
were those that took place underwater.

49:07.017 --> 49:11.772
The dive camera crew were well prepared
to film fishermen in the Philippines.

49:11.817 --> 49:16.254
But they weren't quite prepared
for the dangers they'd witness

49:16.297 --> 49:18.811
and the friendships they'd forge.

49:22.097 --> 49:27.330
Liminangcong is home to the 80 Pa-aling
fishermen that the film crew will follow.

49:43.137 --> 49:48.086
Two fishing boats are crammed
with 80 divers, their food and provisions,

49:48.137 --> 49:51.334
before heading out for two weeks at sea.

49:55.097 --> 49:57.770
At the fishing grounds,
Simon and Roger are playing catch-up,

49:57.817 --> 50:02.288
as their technical underwater equipment
is slowing them down.

50:02.337 --> 50:04.805
They've just dropped the lines.
They didn't even tell us.

50:04.857 --> 50:07.325
The captain seems to be on a mission
to prove something today

50:07.377 --> 50:09.811
so we've got to go fast.

50:12.977 --> 50:16.447
Underwater filming is risky,
but these risks are nothing

50:16.497 --> 50:20.410
compared to those faced daily
by the compressor divers.

50:24.457 --> 50:28.006
Compressor diving
is a dangerous way to make a living.

50:29.257 --> 50:32.329
Air, often tainted with diesel,

50:32.377 --> 50:35.813
is pumped through thin plastic tubes
right down to the divers.

50:38.857 --> 50:42.167
At 64,Joning is one of
the veterans on the boat,

50:42.217 --> 50:45.414
and knows the harsh realities
of compressor diving.

50:59.537 --> 51:03.212
Most of the divers are young and fit,
and they need to be.

51:03.257 --> 51:04.656
It's physically demanding work

51:04.697 --> 51:09.213
and the men are totally reliant
on the compressor to keep them breathing.

51:25.857 --> 51:30.009
To use, basically, what's essentially
a garden hose down at 25 metres,

51:30.057 --> 51:31.888
to pump air into your mouth, is just mad.

51:34.977 --> 51:38.208
The biggest danger for these fishermen
is known as

51:38.257 --> 51:41.169
decompression sickness,
or "the bends".

51:43.097 --> 51:47.727
The bends can happen when divers
have been down deep for a long time,

51:47.777 --> 51:50.530
and then come up too quickly
to the surface.

51:50.577 --> 51:53.489
Nitrogen is absorbed into the body

51:53.537 --> 51:54.936
and, as the divers rise up,

51:54.977 --> 51:59.846
bubbles are formed that can lodge
in the joints, causing intense pain.

52:02.057 --> 52:07.370
Two guys are in real trouble
on this deep dive.

52:07.417 --> 52:10.250
Martin, a young diver, is in such pain

52:10.297 --> 52:13.972
that his friend tries to relieve it
by massaging him.

52:16.257 --> 52:19.408
Once on the surface,
it's obvious to everyone

52:19.457 --> 52:21.846
that Martin is still in trouble.

52:24.737 --> 52:31.210
If not treated, the bends can lead
to permanent injuries and even death.

52:33.337 --> 52:38.047
Meanwhile, the second diver,
Michael, is also having problems.

52:38.097 --> 52:41.169
It seems like two men just came up
with the bends.

52:41.217 --> 52:43.572
They went pretty deep on this dive,
trying to get more fish.

52:43.617 --> 52:47.769
But we've taken them onto our boat
to get some medical attention

52:47.817 --> 52:50.206
so, hopefully, they're all right.

52:51.297 --> 52:55.654
Simon tries to relieve their symptoms
with the crew's first aid supplies.

52:55.697 --> 52:57.130
One more.

52:57.177 --> 53:00.169
Michael's had 1 5 minutes on oxygen now.

53:00.217 --> 53:02.526
I've now put Martin back
onto another set of 1 5 minutes.

53:02.577 --> 53:06.695
This is the...you know,
the rudimentary decompression first aid

53:06.737 --> 53:08.329
we can give them at the moment -

53:08.377 --> 53:12.336
give them oxygen, give them water
to rehydrate and keep them warm.

53:12.377 --> 53:16.290
Both of them are saying
that their symptoms are decreasing

53:16.337 --> 53:20.455
and they are looking a lot more happy
than they did about half an hour ago.

53:20.497 --> 53:22.249
He gives them oxygen,

53:22.297 --> 53:26.051
which helps reduce the nitrogen
in their bodies and relieves their pain,

53:26.097 --> 53:29.612
but even this most basic
of diving first aid

53:29.657 --> 53:32.854
is not normally available
to the Pa-aling fishermen.

53:32.897 --> 53:34.296
No pain?

53:34.337 --> 53:36.487
This isn't surprising,

53:36.537 --> 53:40.735
as the fishermen in the Philippines belong
to the lowest wage earners in the country,

53:40.777 --> 53:45.567
earning about 25 US dollars
for a week's work.

53:46.897 --> 53:52.290
However, for many, like Joning and his
family, this is their whole way of life.

54:23.097 --> 54:27.136
His son had got the bends,
and now has to use crutches.

54:28.857 --> 54:33.055
But this isn't the only time
the dangers of compressor diving

54:33.097 --> 54:34.894
have hit Joning's family.

55:07.857 --> 55:09.575
I'm very sorry about that.

55:09.617 --> 55:13.166
That's...yeah, that's terrible.

55:15.657 --> 55:18.933
- That's very sad, isn't it?
- It is.

55:29.057 --> 55:32.606
Having spent a week living
and working with the compressor divers,

55:32.657 --> 55:36.650
Simon and Roger have become
very close to the fishermen.

55:38.737 --> 55:41.251
To fully understand their way of life,

55:41.297 --> 55:45.973
Simon needed to experience first-hand
what it's like to be a compressor diver.

55:48.777 --> 55:53.089
So Joning is keen to take him
on a shallow dive.

55:54.817 --> 55:58.332
I've seen the boys do it.
They've made it look easy.

55:58.377 --> 56:01.892
But we've had several guys that have
gone down with symptoms of the bends.

56:01.937 --> 56:05.009
I've got to admit I'm feeling
a little bit apprehensive, actually.

56:10.217 --> 56:15.416
Simon has scuba-dived for 1 6 years
and has logged over 3,000 dives,

56:15.457 --> 56:19.132
but this is diving at its most basic.

56:25.657 --> 56:29.093
The first minute, I've got to say,

56:29.137 --> 56:32.527
I was, er...a little bit petrified,
actually.

56:32.577 --> 56:36.968
This is a violent thing. It's just
punching air down your throat.

56:37.017 --> 56:38.086
It's quite mad.

56:38.137 --> 56:41.015
It took me a minute
to kinda get myself under control

56:41.057 --> 56:43.207
and then once you've got the hang of it,

56:43.257 --> 56:46.772
and once you believe in it
and trust in it, then you can swim on.

57:05.937 --> 57:07.893
There were a couple of times
when I lost it, though.

57:07.937 --> 57:09.814
I was flailing around everywhere.

57:09.857 --> 57:12.815
I was trying to find it again
and get it back in.

57:12.857 --> 57:18.011
But Joning was keeping a good eye on me,
and the rest of the guys were as well,

57:18.057 --> 57:23.768
but I wouldn't want to do that for
a whole sort of fish-catching session,

57:23.817 --> 57:25.216
that's for sure.

57:26.897 --> 57:30.776
A strong camaraderie
between the divers has been forged.

57:30.817 --> 57:34.173
The film crew have captured
a dramatic sequence,

57:34.217 --> 57:38.210
and the fishermen head home happy,
with a boatload of fish to sell.

57:57.777 --> 58:03.010
Joning and everyone on board have
finished another Pa-aling fishing trip,

58:03.057 --> 58:06.811
and all can return safe and sound
to their families.
