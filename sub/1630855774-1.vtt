00:13.737 --> 00:16.154
[Swat Officer 1]
Everybody down! El Paso police!

00:17.189 --> 00:18.915
[ominous music]

00:57.712 --> 00:58.644
[Swat Officer 1]
Dear God.

00:59.921 --> 01:01.958
We're going to need more
body bags.

01:13.625 --> 01:16.800
[Swat officer 2] It's like more
of the same everywhere we go.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.287
He's got a gun!

01:52.905 --> 01:54.252
Door!

01:56.909 --> 01:59.257
- [Swat officer 3]
Freeze mother fucker!
- Down, get down!

01:59.395 --> 02:01.017
- Down! Get down!
- Don't move!

02:02.432 --> 02:03.709
[man yelling]

02:04.503 --> 02:05.470
[Swat officer 1]
Stop!

02:05.608 --> 02:06.712
Motherfucker!

02:08.300 --> 02:09.784
Down, stay down.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.372
Don't move.

02:11.510 --> 02:13.305
[heavy breathing]

02:20.519 --> 02:21.934
[tense music]

02:22.763 --> 02:24.385
[clock ticking]

02:31.599 --> 02:32.635
Hey.

02:33.532 --> 02:34.982
[Detective Arden]
Yeah. Good morning.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.777
I certainly wouldn't say that.

02:36.915 --> 02:38.537
Yeah, so you heard.

02:38.675 --> 02:40.953
I got the basic highlights.

02:41.091 --> 02:42.576
Why don't you fill me in?

02:42.714 --> 02:44.440
[heavy sigh]

02:44.578 --> 02:46.821
27 dead bodies all shot
in the head between 2 and 4 AM.

02:47.995 --> 02:50.549
Four children, among
the victims. All Hispanics.

02:50.687 --> 02:55.105
No documentation on any of
them... and only one survivor.

02:55.244 --> 02:58.281
- I bet he's got one
hell of a story to tell.
- Hmm.

02:59.317 --> 03:02.182
I can't wait to hear it.

03:02.492 --> 03:03.735
Okay.

03:08.636 --> 03:09.361
Detective Arden.

03:09.499 --> 03:10.397
And she is...

03:28.449 --> 03:30.727
I spent a lot of time here.

03:30.865 --> 03:32.281
Thank the good lord.
Did you hear English?

03:32.419 --> 03:34.075
- I heard something...
- I heard English.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.422
Juan? Is it Juan?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.630
Sure.

03:36.768 --> 03:37.700
Juan.

03:37.838 --> 03:39.391
Johnny, John.

03:42.394 --> 03:44.051
Most call me, El Viajero.

03:44.189 --> 03:46.640
Uh, what does that mean?

03:48.020 --> 03:49.401
The traveler.

03:49.539 --> 03:52.887
Ooh. The traveler.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.200
The traveler, I like that.

03:55.338 --> 03:57.961
Look, I don't mean to be
rude here,

03:58.099 --> 04:01.137
but I haven't committed
any crimes. Please.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.656
I'm the victim here.

04:02.794 --> 04:04.899
I will fully cooperate with you.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.626
But after, please let me go.

04:07.764 --> 04:09.766
So you have somewhere to be?

04:09.904 --> 04:11.630
I do, in fact.

04:11.768 --> 04:14.254
I'm trying to make it to my
sister's wedding in San Antonio,

04:14.702 --> 04:15.738
It's tonight.

04:16.808 --> 04:19.155
It's why I traveled down here.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.881
So you're in this country
illegally?

04:21.019 --> 04:22.158
Oh, no, no.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.472
I was born here.

04:25.610 --> 04:27.957
- I live in South America.
Mm hmm.

04:28.095 --> 04:33.134
I find my low profile way of
getting around to be best suited
for my lifestyle.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.826
You said you were born here.

04:34.964 --> 04:37.207
Where's your documentation?

04:37.346 --> 04:40.176
I had an old ID, but
the pinche coyote was holding on
to all of our possessions.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.971
- Wait, the coyote?
- Yes.

04:42.109 --> 04:44.353
That was a large group
he smuggled across the border.

04:44.491 --> 04:46.216
That was a safe house
we were staying in.

04:46.355 --> 04:48.909
We were supposed to lay low
and leave the next morning.

04:49.047 --> 04:50.911
But it didn't work out that way.

04:51.049 --> 04:52.222
What happened?

04:52.361 --> 04:54.155
Some cartel bullshit.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.985
They wanted to send a message.

04:56.123 --> 04:57.607
They tied a man to a chair,

04:58.401 --> 04:59.713
and made the others watch.

05:00.023 --> 05:01.646
[offscreen gunshots]
Sick fuckers.

05:01.784 --> 05:04.131
Took their time too.

05:04.269 --> 05:06.375
Executing people

05:06.513 --> 05:07.962
one by one.

05:08.515 --> 05:10.827
But you're the only one
left standing.

05:11.587 --> 05:13.727
How are you
the only one unharmed.

05:13.865 --> 05:16.557
Haven't I been through
enough already tonight?

05:16.695 --> 05:19.215
Look, I cannot stress it enough
how important it is for me
to leave.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.217
Why are you so scared?

05:21.355 --> 05:22.460
You scared something?

05:22.598 --> 05:24.082
- Or maybe somebody?
- Yes.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.705
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I am. Yes.

05:26.843 --> 05:28.949
Well, I got to tell you,
you're in the safest place you
possibly can be.

05:29.087 --> 05:31.503
Did you see how many bodies
there were?

05:31.641 --> 05:33.919
I had to watch all of that!

05:34.057 --> 05:37.233
Would you feel safe
in some podunk jailhouse?

05:39.269 --> 05:40.892
- No offense.
- None taken.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.652
Speak for yourself.

05:43.412 --> 05:44.965
Detectives.

05:45.862 --> 05:49.176
You have no idea what is coming.

05:50.557 --> 05:52.213
And believe me...

05:53.318 --> 05:56.977
if I don't leave here
within the next 90 minutes,

05:58.185 --> 06:00.394
we are all going to be dead.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.570
Is that a threat, Mr. Garcia?

06:03.708 --> 06:06.158
No, no, not at all.

06:07.021 --> 06:08.126
It's a warning.

06:09.196 --> 06:12.855
There are powers far darker
than that of men.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.514
Forces for deadlier
than I or you,

06:17.169 --> 06:18.619
could even possibly comprehend.

06:19.517 --> 06:21.519
These lands

06:22.036 --> 06:24.176
are filled with magic.

06:25.971 --> 06:27.732
Creatures that defy...

06:27.870 --> 06:29.492
Our imagination.

06:32.495 --> 06:35.360
Well from one bullshitter
to another,

06:35.498 --> 06:36.706
I got to tell you, uh,

06:36.844 --> 06:39.122
I would have stuck
with the uh...

06:39.260 --> 06:40.434
Wedding.

06:40.572 --> 06:41.470
- The wedding story.
- Wedding.

06:41.608 --> 06:43.333
Yeah. I mean, that,

06:43.472 --> 06:44.783
- pulled in my heartstrings
a little bit.
- Yes.

06:44.921 --> 06:46.129
Everyone loves a big wedding.

06:46.267 --> 06:48.028
I feel sorry for you chubby.

06:49.547 --> 06:51.652
Look, you.

06:51.790 --> 06:55.656
Are not going anywhere until you
tell us about these people.

06:55.794 --> 06:57.382
I don't know any of
these people.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.419
I was on the bus with them
for all of 4 hours.

06:59.557 --> 07:02.629
I didn't get a chance to know
any of them.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.736
I know this one.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.255
I know this one.

07:08.393 --> 07:10.015
Okay.

07:10.153 --> 07:12.846
It's hard to tell, with all
the bullets in his face.

07:12.984 --> 07:15.435
Do you know this person
or do you not know this person?

07:15.573 --> 07:20.232
I am not sure if I met
him before or after...

07:21.095 --> 07:22.683
he died.

07:22.821 --> 07:24.858
- After he died?
- Yeah, what does that mean?

07:24.996 --> 07:26.480
Detectives.

07:26.618 --> 07:28.240
Death is never the end.

07:28.378 --> 07:30.311
- Oh, Jesus.
- Here we go.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.315
There are portals back and forth

07:35.006 --> 07:36.835
from one realm to the other.

07:36.973 --> 07:40.736
Problem is, sometimes portals
don't close once they're open.

07:40.874 --> 07:42.220
Sure.

07:42.358 --> 07:43.842
No one knew this better
than Gustavo.

07:44.774 --> 07:45.810
Gustavo.

07:46.742 --> 07:48.157
Tell us about Gustavo.

07:48.295 --> 07:50.159
When I knew him,

07:50.504 --> 07:52.920
we were in Argentina.

07:53.058 --> 07:55.785
He had a very special sight.

07:57.028 --> 07:58.478
He could see

07:58.616 --> 08:00.410
what no one else could see.

08:29.163 --> 08:30.406
[ominous music]

more intense]

11:02.385 --> 11:04.008
[rubik's cube noises]

11:04.594 --> 11:06.562
[Jessy] What do you mean you
don't want to go?

11:15.088 --> 11:17.987
You realize I already signed
you up for the tournament

11:18.125 --> 11:21.404
yesterday, and that I was gonna
get your plane tickets tomorrow?

11:22.992 --> 11:26.686
- Can you please explain
what's going on?
- I don't making...

11:27.479 --> 11:28.929
competitive times.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.380
I don't know what

11:31.518 --> 11:32.726
happening?

11:33.416 --> 11:35.487
- To me.
- You did 7 seconds.

11:36.488 --> 11:39.837
7 seconds, Guti,
that's 2 seconds away
from the world record.

11:39.975 --> 11:42.356
Right now I'm not doing
7 seconds.

11:45.187 --> 11:47.223
Look.

11:47.948 --> 11:50.468
I don't care about the money,
I already told you.
I don't care about the money.

11:50.606 --> 11:54.023
And if you get top ten,
it's 8,000 dollars.

11:54.610 --> 11:56.198
8,000 dollars in Argentina,

11:56.336 --> 11:58.856
you can live like Rockefeller
with that money.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.250
[Gustavo]
I'm going

12:14.975 --> 12:15.907
to make...

12:16.045 --> 12:17.806
you lose the money.

12:18.254 --> 12:20.291
you are investing in me.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
You drove your tenants crazy.

14:03.566 --> 14:05.637
- Podcast! Pod. Cast!

14:05.775 --> 14:06.638

19:21.160 --> 19:23.955
I, I will compete anyway.

19:24.853 --> 19:26.165
Uhm...

19:26.303 --> 19:28.132
Maybe, it's eh,

19:28.857 --> 19:29.927
like,

19:30.065 --> 19:31.411
you told me.

That's everything
I know about the guy.

30:10.947 --> 30:12.880
I don't think that's him.
I don't think so.

30:13.018 --> 30:15.365
So we're telling ghost stories
now, is that what you're doing?

30:15.503 --> 30:17.022
You ask what I know.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.129
Detectives can I get a word?

30:22.959 --> 30:23.718

something.

We ran his mug shot through
the image archives and we got
a match.

30:34.936 --> 30:36.524
We get a few of them actually.

30:36.662 --> 30:39.113
The first one that popped
up was 1996.

30:39.251 --> 30:41.874
Couple petty crimes,
shoplifting,
some traffic violations.

30:42.012 --> 30:45.188
But then we have another
mugshot,

30:45.326 --> 30:47.811
different name,
Antonio Salguero.

30:47.949 --> 30:49.986
That's pretty much
the same, right?

30:50.124 --> 30:52.436
Well this mugshot is from 1982.

30:52.574 --> 30:54.024
[Detective Gibbons]
Bullshit.

30:54.162 --> 30:56.095
He'd be ten years old in
this picture.

30:56.233 --> 30:57.786
Maybe he just looks
mature for his age.

30:57.925 --> 31:01.376
And here's one from 1973.

31:02.481 --> 31:06.519
- What?
- But there's this other
one odd fact.

31:06.657 --> 31:07.866
What's that?

31:08.004 --> 31:10.420
According to our records,
he's dead.

31:10.558 --> 31:13.388
- He's dead?
- Yeah. He died in 1997.
Car accident.

31:13.526 --> 31:15.632
[chuckling]

31:15.770 --> 31:17.737
Well, obviously he isn't dead,
so they must have IDed
the wrong guy.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.257
Look, maybe this is some weird
computer glitch or maybe someone

31:20.395 --> 31:22.742
put it in the wrong information
when they were entering
the data.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.574
But as far as the state of Texas
is concerned,
that's a dead man in there.

31:32.131 --> 31:33.961
- We have less than an hour.
- Yeah.

31:34.099 --> 31:35.134
Can I please go?

31:35.272 --> 31:36.895
[chuckling]

31:37.033 --> 31:39.242
We'll let you do that as soon as
you tell us the truth.

31:39.380 --> 31:41.796
I have told you the truth.

31:41.934 --> 31:44.316
I have complied completely.

31:44.730 --> 31:45.662
Juan Garcia died

31:45.800 --> 31:48.665
in a car accident in 1997.

31:48.803 --> 31:52.082
Mr. Garcia, we're going to ask
you one last time, for God's
sakes, tell us the truth.

31:52.876 --> 31:54.429
Come on, who are you?

31:56.949 --> 31:59.089
The reason I survived

31:59.227 --> 32:01.609
- the traffic accident.
- Okay?

32:01.747 --> 32:04.439
The reason I survived
last night.

32:04.577 --> 32:07.995
- Yeah.
- Is because I cannot die.

32:08.133 --> 32:09.617
[Arden scoffing]

32:10.549 --> 32:12.033
He can't die now.

32:14.001 --> 32:17.280
[Gibbons laughing]

32:20.939 --> 32:22.630
Are you telling us,

32:23.769 --> 32:25.253
that you're immortal?

32:25.391 --> 32:27.255
[everyone laughing]

32:28.843 --> 32:31.328
To a certain extent...

32:32.433 --> 32:33.779
that is correct.

32:35.332 --> 32:38.128
If you don't believe me, there's
a real quick way I can prove

32:38.266 --> 32:40.544
- that I'm not lying to you.
- How's that?

32:40.682 --> 32:42.857
Take your weapon and point it
at my head and pull the trigger!

32:42.995 --> 32:44.065
You know we're not
gonna be able--

32:44.203 --> 32:46.033
Take your weapon,
shut the fuck up!

32:46.171 --> 32:48.621
- Take your-- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck the up.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.003
- I'm not taking my gun out.
- Take your weapon, point it
at my head and pull the trigger.

32:51.141 --> 32:53.902
- Okay.
- I'm not fucking lying! Do it.

32:54.041 --> 32:56.008
And let's end this back
and forth.

32:58.907 --> 33:01.013
You know what?

33:01.151 --> 33:03.705
We're going to take you back
to your cell so you can calm
the hell down.

33:03.843 --> 33:04.741
No, no, no, no, no.

33:04.879 --> 33:06.536
That's not what I want.

33:10.850 --> 33:12.438
What's he doing?

33:16.546 --> 33:18.375
Remember,

33:18.513 --> 33:20.550
when I came in bleeding because
I tried to hack my hand off.

33:21.965 --> 33:24.002
Where's the scar?

33:24.140 --> 33:25.865
- How'd you do that?
- That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.315
But you don't listen.

33:27.453 --> 33:29.904
[spiritual flute music]

33:30.836 --> 33:32.010
I am.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.426
Matlalihuitl,

33:34.874 --> 33:36.669
Chalchiuhtlatona.

33:37.808 --> 33:39.293
I'm from Tenochtitlan,

33:40.501 --> 33:42.537
the capital of the Aztec Empire.

33:43.573 --> 33:45.230
542 years ago.

33:45.816 --> 33:46.714
Uh huh...

33:46.852 --> 33:48.474
See, so you lied to us.

33:48.612 --> 33:50.545
You said you were born
in the U.S.?

33:52.409 --> 33:54.239
Goddammit chubby.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.828
- Is that all you got from this?
- Yeah.

33:58.553 --> 34:01.039
You're barking up the wrong tree
with this magic shit.

34:07.769 --> 34:10.358
There's a series of murders,
that went unsolved around
these parts,

34:11.601 --> 34:13.327
Yeah, we, uh...

34:14.328 --> 34:16.088
- We have a lot of those.
- All the time.

34:16.537 --> 34:17.986
But these were different.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.609
Were they not?

34:19.919 --> 34:22.232
These victims were drained
of all their blood.

34:23.026 --> 34:24.545
That was, uh...

34:25.891 --> 34:27.927
very highly publicized.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.998
What if I told you who did it?

34:31.621 --> 34:33.312
Will you let me go?

34:34.002 --> 34:36.591
You better not be telling us

34:36.729 --> 34:38.214
a vampire story.

34:39.801 --> 34:42.804
You bet your asses
I'm telling you a vampire story.

34:51.744 --> 34:54.161
[spooky Halloween music]

35:29.955 --> 35:30.990

36:07.441 --> 36:09.788
[Vampire]
Return to me.

36:12.860 --> 36:14.413
You are...

36:14.551 --> 36:16.208
under my thrall.

36:17.658 --> 36:19.384
My word

36:20.005 --> 36:21.869
is your command.

36:22.007 --> 36:23.733
[dog barking]

[dog growling]

36:27.392 --> 36:28.910
Blah, blah!

36:29.048 --> 36:32.742
I want to suck your blood.

36:33.743 --> 36:35.538
[dog growling]

36:38.299 --> 36:39.645
Fucking Halloween.

36:40.681 --> 36:42.303
Come on, Ellie.

37:03.842 --> 37:05.119
[hissing]

37:08.018 --> 37:10.124
Must you disturb me?

37:10.262 --> 37:14.439
I have but one night a year
in which I can enjoy myself
in public.

37:14.577 --> 37:15.612
Hey asshole.

37:15.750 --> 37:16.993
Do you know what time it is?

37:17.131 --> 37:19.133
[Vampire]
You would call me for the time!?

37:19.478 --> 37:22.516
Don't you young people have
devices that tell you
such things?

37:22.723 --> 37:24.172
We do.

37:24.311 --> 37:26.830
They also tell us
when it's Daylight Savings Time.

37:26.968 --> 37:29.281
I'm sorry. Come again.
What was that? What?

37:29.419 --> 37:31.456
No, no, no, no, no.

37:31.594 --> 37:33.423
That's not right.

37:33.561 --> 37:35.977
It's like this in the fall
it goes forward.

37:36.115 --> 37:38.014
In the spring - backwards.

37:38.152 --> 37:39.636
It's the other way around dummy.

37:39.774 --> 37:41.949
Sunrise is one hour earlier.

37:42.087 --> 37:44.262
6 a.m. instead of seven.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.780
What does the sky tell you?

37:47.541 --> 37:48.990
Oh fuck.

37:49.128 --> 37:52.511
You have 15 minutes
until sunrise.

37:52.649 --> 37:54.720
How far away are you?

37:55.445 --> 37:57.033
Not that far.

37:57.171 --> 37:59.277
Tell me you weren't stupid
enough to go into town.

37:59.415 --> 38:01.140
Of course not.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.867
- I'm not an idiot.
- I'm dealing with a child.

38:04.005 --> 38:05.697
That's enough.

38:05.835 --> 38:08.700
I am hundreds of years,
your elder.

38:08.838 --> 38:11.634
I have lived a dozen lives.

38:11.772 --> 38:14.464
I have drank the blood
of kings and queens.

38:14.602 --> 38:16.155
I have destroyed armies.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.365
I have reigned terror all over--

38:18.503 --> 38:19.676
Blah, blah, blah.

38:19.814 --> 38:21.195
I'm hanging up.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.024
No, no, no.
Please, please, please, no.

38:23.162 --> 38:25.475
This is exactly why I try
to teach you how to drive.

38:25.682 --> 38:27.926
You insisted in the old ways.

38:28.064 --> 38:31.343
And now you want me to go
out there and put myself
at risk.

38:31.481 --> 38:33.897
Maribel, please.

38:34.035 --> 38:36.003
Exactly where are you?

38:37.384 --> 38:38.833
Old town.

38:39.489 --> 38:40.490
Excuse me.

38:42.285 --> 38:44.218
- Old town.
- Jesus.

38:44.667 --> 38:46.220
You're going to die.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.911
You're never going
to make it back here on time.

38:48.049 --> 38:49.672
You're always with
the pessimism.

38:49.810 --> 38:52.502
- Why can't you just fly?
- Fly?

38:52.882 --> 38:55.229
- Are you insane?
- Turn into a bat.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.956
I mean, you always told me
you can transform.

38:58.474 --> 39:00.407
Was that another one
of your lies?

39:00.545 --> 39:03.548
I lied? No, no,
I just haven't done it
in a while.

39:03.686 --> 39:05.515
So I'm a little out of practice.

39:05.653 --> 39:08.346
- Yeah, right.
- Silence!

39:08.829 --> 39:10.382
I'm your master.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.005
I command you.

that master thing.
I'm sorry, my love.

39:23.050 --> 39:25.155
I didn't mean that, please.

01:02:15.421 --> 01:02:17.043
Stay right where you are.

01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:19.908
Pick up will be arranged for you
tomorrow at 1800 hours.

01:02:20.219 --> 01:02:22.117
Why can't it be tonight!

01:02:24.257 --> 01:02:26.087
I'm ready waiting here.

01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:29.642
Save now.

01:02:30.401 --> 01:02:31.920
[sobbing]

01:02:32.956 --> 01:02:34.509
[Agent]
One more thing,

01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.649
does anybody know you're there?

01:02:37.961 --> 01:02:39.031
No sir.

01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:40.653
[Ramón gasping]

01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:43.863
[cocking shotgun]

01:02:50.111 --> 01:02:52.009
[door breaking]

01:02:58.188 --> 01:03:00.017
[tense ominous music]

01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:07.093
[animal screech]

01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:10.338
[Ramón yelling in pain]
[high pitched tone]

01:03:20.658 --> 01:03:23.006
[animalistic growling]

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.534
[horse neighing]

01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:47.858
[Ramón crying and laughing]

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.287
[animalistic growl]

01:04:03.425 --> 01:04:05.393
[Ramón yelling]

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.598
[Ramón yelling angrily]

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.580
[chaotic orchestral music]

01:05:04.866 --> 01:05:06.557

01:05:10.527 --> 01:05:12.460
[water flowing]

01:05:15.187 --> 01:05:16.360
[gurgling water]

01:05:23.022 --> 01:05:24.886
[Ramón coughing and wheezing]

01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:37.623
[distant horn]
[birds screeching]

01:05:54.605 --> 01:05:56.055
[birds screeching]

01:06:05.306 --> 01:06:08.205

[woman chanting]
[bells ringing]

01:07:09.163 --> 01:07:11.096
[Ramón laughing hysterically]

01:08:13.606 --> 01:08:15.160
[Ramón screaming in pain]

01:08:16.885 --> 01:08:18.370
[ropes tightening]

01:08:24.307 --> 01:08:25.894
[Ramón screaming in pain]

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:27.793
[ropes tightening]

01:09:45.388 --> 01:09:47.355
[birds screeching]
[forest noises]

01:10:10.136 --> 01:10:11.103
[cutting]

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:12.553
[Ramón gurgling]

01:10:21.872 --> 01:10:23.046
[woman groaning]

01:10:29.811 --> 01:10:31.123
[bones cracking]

01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:37.888
[bones cracking]

01:11:00.739 --> 01:11:01.843
[woman yelling]

01:11:06.676 --> 01:11:09.334
[animalistic growling]
[birds screeching]

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.382
[woman laughing]
[men growling]

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.023
[animalistic growling]

01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:24.512

01:12:35.212 --> 01:12:37.042

01:13:06.554 --> 01:13:07.728

01:13:39.932 --> 01:13:41.037
[somber music]

01:13:54.671 --> 01:13:57.950
[speaking indigenous language]

01:14:04.647 --> 01:14:08.582
[speaking indigenous language]

01:14:10.515 --> 01:14:12.827
[group chanting]

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:43.202
[people chanting and praying]

01:14:56.043 --> 01:14:57.907
[nature sounds intensifying]

01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:12.266
And you actually expect us
to believe that?

01:15:13.025 --> 01:15:14.233
Honestly, no.

01:15:14.855 --> 01:15:17.513
- But that's exactly
what happened.
- Here.

01:15:18.859 --> 01:15:22.345
- What's this?
- [Juan] A sacred bullet.

01:15:22.483 --> 01:15:23.898
It's filled with the sawdust...

01:15:24.036 --> 01:15:25.590
Of Christ's cross.

01:15:25.728 --> 01:15:27.488
It was forged with the iron,

01:15:27.626 --> 01:15:29.352
with the nails used to crucify
him.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:30.940
It can stop anything.

01:15:31.078 --> 01:15:32.700
Saint...or Sinner.

01:15:33.425 --> 01:15:36.739
Well, it doesn't matter now,
because the gun that shoots
the thing it...

01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:39.224
has been lost for 80 years.

01:15:40.432 --> 01:15:42.054
Why would you need
such a bullet?

01:15:42.192 --> 01:15:44.194
Because it's the only thing that
can stop what's coming.

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:47.197
And believe me,
if you don't let me go,

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:53.238
it will destroy everything in
its path to get to me.

01:15:53.894 --> 01:15:55.551
I thought you said you
couldn't die.

01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:58.657
There's one thing that
can kill me.

01:15:58.795 --> 01:15:59.969
San la Muerte.

01:16:00.694 --> 01:16:01.902
Saint Death.

01:16:03.075 --> 01:16:04.387
Santa Muerte.

01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:07.977
Santa Muerte, is Mexica.

01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:10.151
from Mexico.

01:16:10.289 --> 01:16:12.119
- Right.
- San La Muerte.

01:16:12.464 --> 01:16:14.224
Is a saint from Colombia.

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:15.674
Okay.

01:16:15.812 --> 01:16:18.090
It's who you go to when
you're desperate,

01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:19.575
for a favor.

01:16:19.989 --> 01:16:22.439
- Of course.
- Long time ago I...

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:25.753
I needed a favor.

01:16:27.272 --> 01:16:29.964
You asked me if I stole
this ring.

01:16:31.276 --> 01:16:33.485
No, detectives. No.

01:16:33.899 --> 01:16:35.660
This was my engagement ring.

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:37.938
I was married to a
beautiful woman.

01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:40.596
Anacaona.

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:42.943
We had a child.

01:16:44.876 --> 01:16:45.704
Itzcali.

01:16:47.223 --> 01:16:49.018
But both were chosen to be
sacrificed.

01:16:50.122 --> 01:16:53.678
So I made a deal with
San La Muerte.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.821
Their lives in exchange
for mine.

01:16:58.959 --> 01:17:01.617
When my time came, I was scared.

01:17:03.135 --> 01:17:04.792
So I ran away.

01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:06.725
It's why I survived.

01:17:06.863 --> 01:17:08.037
All this time.

01:17:08.175 --> 01:17:10.487
By being one step
ahead of death.

01:17:12.179 --> 01:17:14.388
I need an aspirin.

01:17:19.773 --> 01:17:21.153
[door opening and closing]

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:22.534
Uh...

01:17:26.469 --> 01:17:27.988
Okay.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:44.694
Why is this San La Muerte,
coming for you?

01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:46.351
Why today?

01:17:49.492 --> 01:17:51.011
He's always been coming for me.

01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:53.082
He has been for the majority
of my life.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.877
But I have to keep moving.

01:17:55.843 --> 01:17:59.122
I'm always several hours ahead
of him, usually no more than 12.

01:17:59.882 --> 01:18:03.023
But if I stand still or end up
in a predicament like this,

01:18:04.334 --> 01:18:06.026
he has time to catch me.

01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:08.028
And it never ends well.

01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:13.827
Mr. Traveler...

01:18:14.551 --> 01:18:16.933
The uh...
The markings on the bullet

01:18:17.071 --> 01:18:19.591
reminded me of something
I'd seen before,

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:21.697
at a crime scene.

01:18:24.044 --> 01:18:25.977
El Matador Divino.

01:18:26.115 --> 01:18:27.944
The Saint Killer.

01:18:28.082 --> 01:18:30.222
What is a saint killer?

01:18:31.361 --> 01:18:33.191
Where do you have this?
Is this here?

01:18:33.329 --> 01:18:34.779
You have to give it to me.

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:36.056
Okay.

01:18:36.194 --> 01:18:38.127
- Uh, hey, Arden.
- Yeah?

01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:41.509
Would you mind going out there
to the evidence cabinet and

01:18:41.647 --> 01:18:43.684
bringing me the weapon.

01:18:43.822 --> 01:18:46.031
To give to the suspect.

01:18:46.169 --> 01:18:48.551
Sure. Would you like me to
load it for you?

01:18:48.689 --> 01:18:50.691
Get the fuck out of here man.

01:18:50.829 --> 01:18:51.554
[Gibbons laughing angrily]

01:18:51.692 --> 01:18:53.038
Made my head itch!

01:18:54.074 --> 01:18:55.178
[scoffing]

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.664
I should have known
that I was fucked

01:18:58.803 --> 01:19:01.495
the moment I was locked up in a
room with a fucking gringo.

01:19:03.635 --> 01:19:05.982
tinker with our toys,
and it's us who get fucked!

01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:09.089
[Juan laughing]

01:19:15.923 --> 01:19:17.856
It is exactly what happened
to Malcolm?

01:19:17.994 --> 01:19:19.513
Who the fuck is Malcolm?

01:19:19.651 --> 01:19:21.618
You wanna know about
fucking Malcolm?

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.828
Oh, please don't.

01:19:23.966 --> 01:19:25.519
Let me tell you about Malcolm.

01:19:30.524 --> 01:19:33.492
[Mariachi music]

01:19:49.301 --> 01:19:50.682
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:51.165 --> 01:19:52.788
[Amy]
How's it going?

01:19:55.066 --> 01:19:56.861
I haven't been here in a while.

01:19:57.654 --> 01:20:00.865
- Doesn't look any different
than I remember.
- You always liked this place.

01:20:01.003 --> 01:20:02.314
That'd be nice to meet here.

01:20:02.452 --> 01:20:04.523
And I actually think this
was the table.

01:20:04.661 --> 01:20:06.629
Uh, when you broke up with me.

01:20:06.767 --> 01:20:09.218
- Come on.
- I'm just.

01:20:09.356 --> 01:20:11.565
I tried to convince myself
that the reason we broke up

01:20:11.703 --> 01:20:13.912
that night is because you were
just upset that they got your
order wrong.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:15.396
No, no, no.

01:20:15.534 --> 01:20:17.226
It was definitely you.

01:20:17.364 --> 01:20:18.848
Sure that's a little different.

01:20:18.986 --> 01:20:20.160
You were an asshole back then.

01:20:20.298 --> 01:20:22.334
Yeah I know you mentioned that.

01:20:22.472 --> 01:20:24.992
Also, you look like shit.

01:20:25.751 --> 01:20:27.650
- What happened to you?
- Yeah...

01:20:28.547 --> 01:20:29.928
Where is everybody?

01:20:30.066 --> 01:20:31.619
Are Gus and Ed joining us?

01:20:32.344 --> 01:20:35.623
What are you talking about?
Gus, Ed?

01:20:36.417 --> 01:20:37.833
They're all dead.

01:20:38.592 --> 01:20:39.731
Dead?

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:41.388
Yeah.

01:20:41.526 --> 01:20:42.872
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:45.461
- After Havana, what do--
- Shhh.

01:20:46.393 --> 01:20:48.498
I thought we'd never speak again
of what happened in Havana.

01:20:48.636 --> 01:20:49.534
I thought that was what
you wanted.

01:20:49.672 --> 01:20:51.260
Yeah that was what I wanted.

01:20:51.398 --> 01:20:53.365
Until all our friends
fucking died! Because of it.

01:20:53.503 --> 01:20:54.746
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:56.644
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

01:20:56.782 --> 01:20:57.853
Uhm...

01:20:58.888 --> 01:21:00.200
So, uh...

01:21:00.338 --> 01:21:01.649
I think

01:21:02.305 --> 01:21:04.273
we've all been cursed.

01:21:04.411 --> 01:21:06.862
And there is something
out to get us.

01:21:08.173 --> 01:21:09.416
Malcolm.

01:21:09.554 --> 01:21:10.624
[scoffing]

01:21:10.762 --> 01:21:12.074
Do you hear what you're saying?

01:21:12.212 --> 01:21:13.282
Here look I'll,

01:21:13.592 --> 01:21:15.111
prove it to you.

01:21:15.249 --> 01:21:17.976
Do you remember when we took
this picture?

01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:20.910
Yeah, it was right before we
went into that

01:21:21.531 --> 01:21:23.050
weird ceremony.

01:21:23.188 --> 01:21:24.914
Exactly.

01:21:25.052 --> 01:21:27.089
You don't remember anything
about that ceremony do you?

01:21:27.606 --> 01:21:28.849
No.

01:21:29.401 --> 01:21:31.403
What we saw.

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:32.991
We were not supposed to see.

01:21:33.129 --> 01:21:34.820
We were not supposed
to be there.

01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:36.822
That ceremony was secret
for a reason.

01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:39.273
And then none of that stuff
was supposed to get out.

01:21:41.655 --> 01:21:42.552
But I recorded it.

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:44.071
Wait, you recorded it?

01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.762
- Yes.
- Jesus, Malcolm.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.213
- I know.
- They were crystal clear
about that.

01:21:48.351 --> 01:21:50.871
I did it for your fucking
documentary, okay?

01:21:51.009 --> 01:21:53.149
And I thought it was all
bullshit anyway.

01:21:53.287 --> 01:21:56.049
I think that by recording it.

01:21:58.361 --> 01:21:59.742
I awoke something.

01:22:01.088 --> 01:22:02.434
and now it's coming for us.

01:22:02.572 --> 01:22:04.402
What do you mean
awoke something?

01:22:04.609 --> 01:22:06.783
Like a demon?

01:22:07.336 --> 01:22:08.337
Demons.

01:22:09.027 --> 01:22:10.511
And they're coming for
us. And they're going to

01:22:10.649 --> 01:22:12.824
take us over one by
one until we are all dead.

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:14.446
Malcolm, honey,

01:22:15.137 --> 01:22:16.276
are you on meds?

01:22:16.414 --> 01:22:18.623
None of this makes any sense.

01:22:18.761 --> 01:22:20.797
Look at the picture. Okay.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.696
You see, Gus?
See that he's wearing red?

01:22:22.834 --> 01:22:25.630
Red is the color of Siete Rayos
the ruler of fire.

01:22:25.768 --> 01:22:26.872
Do you want to know
how Gus died?

01:22:27.011 --> 01:22:28.978
He was burned alive.

01:22:29.116 --> 01:22:30.531
- Was it an accident?
- He was burned
from the inside out.

01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:31.877
What do you fucking think?
I don't know.

01:22:32.016 --> 01:22:33.534
Now look at Carol.

01:22:33.672 --> 01:22:35.467
See how her hair is like that?

01:22:35.605 --> 01:22:37.814
That's Kimbabula,
the ruler of wind.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:41.473
She was crushed by a hurricane
in her own fucking apartment.

01:22:43.475 --> 01:22:45.374
[Amy]
What about Ed?

01:22:45.512 --> 01:22:47.307
- See how he's holding
his crotch?
- Oh, yeah, that's...

01:22:48.135 --> 01:22:49.688
- That's typical Ed.
- Yeah.

01:22:49.826 --> 01:22:52.519
I think that's Mama Chola,
ruler of human pleasures.

01:22:52.657 --> 01:22:54.866
You remember that girl
he was hooking up with in Cuba?

01:22:55.004 --> 01:22:57.386
Well, I guess her vagina turned
to a fucking woodchipper

01:22:57.524 --> 01:22:59.802
because they had to hose him off
the ceiling.

01:23:02.529 --> 01:23:04.048
What about Miguel?

01:23:04.186 --> 01:23:05.946
He did this.

01:23:06.843 --> 01:23:07.879
Uhm...

01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:11.227
He died.
He died a week ago

01:23:12.711 --> 01:23:14.058
Uh, in front of me.

01:23:14.817 --> 01:23:16.370
[sighing]
Okay,

01:23:18.338 --> 01:23:19.649
let's stop this.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.238
Where's the recording?

01:23:23.067 --> 01:23:24.551
Let's destroy it.

01:23:24.689 --> 01:23:26.035
No, I already,
I already tried that. I tried.

01:23:26.173 --> 01:23:28.382
I tried it all. I melted it,
busted it apart.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.867
I threw it in the ocean
and just keeps on coming back.

01:23:31.489 --> 01:23:32.869
Why?

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.424
I think maybe they need it
to get out.

01:23:35.562 --> 01:23:38.910
I mean, we're the ones who heard
it and look what's
happened to us.

01:23:39.393 --> 01:23:42.465
Now, imagine if that thing goes
on YouTube or some asshole with
a podcast

01:23:42.603 --> 01:23:46.193
plays it for his listeners and
then you have 100 million
fucking maniacs.

01:23:46.331 --> 01:23:48.506
- It would be the end.
- Of the fucking world, yeah.

01:23:49.645 --> 01:23:52.234
Right, you said that it's
taking over us.

01:23:53.476 --> 01:23:54.753
As in possessing?

01:23:56.514 --> 01:23:58.240
If everyone else is dead,

01:24:00.104 --> 01:24:02.313
that means it has to be
one of us now.

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:04.660
Yeah.

01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:07.628
You... You think it's me?

01:24:08.664 --> 01:24:10.079
You're saying that I'm
possessed?

01:24:11.563 --> 01:24:12.875
Malcolm, stop acting crazy.

01:24:13.013 --> 01:24:14.877
I'm not possessed.

01:24:15.464 --> 01:24:16.603
It's me,

01:24:17.293 --> 01:24:18.122
Amy.

01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:21.677
That's just it I don't
think you are.

01:24:21.815 --> 01:24:24.473
I think you're tricking me
into believing you're Amy.

01:24:24.749 --> 01:24:27.579
You're actually the last
one of them.

01:24:28.718 --> 01:24:30.479
Nzambi Mpungo.

01:24:31.963 --> 01:24:34.310

- King Zombie.

01:24:35.449 --> 01:24:36.347
[Amy laughing]

01:24:36.485 --> 01:24:37.555
King Zombie.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.833
What the fuck?

01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:41.317
- Seriously?
- King Zombie.

01:24:41.455 --> 01:24:42.801
What makes you think that?

01:24:42.939 --> 01:24:46.081
Oh, for starters,
you invited me here

01:24:48.945 --> 01:24:50.568
thought it would be a
safe space.

01:24:50.706 --> 01:24:54.123
Something I'm familiar
with, a lot of people around.

01:24:55.435 --> 01:24:56.505
I feel safe, you know,

01:24:56.643 --> 01:24:59.266
I let my guard down and then...

01:25:00.716 --> 01:25:02.752
you rip me to shreds and
take the tape.

01:25:03.236 --> 01:25:06.377
I asked you here because
it was our favorite spot.

01:25:06.515 --> 01:25:08.862
I mean, it was our favorite
spot, it was my favorite spot.

01:25:09.414 --> 01:25:11.968
But this restaurant closed
down years ago.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:15.213
Now, I know Amy knows that,
but I don't know if she knows
that I know that.

01:25:16.628 --> 01:25:18.699
Mainly because I made a big
stink about never coming back

01:25:18.837 --> 01:25:20.805
to my favorite restaurant,
because of the heartbreak.

01:25:21.426 --> 01:25:22.703
But I came back.

01:25:22.841 --> 01:25:24.257
I love the food here.

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:27.294
So, no,

01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:29.883
I don't think this
place is real.

01:25:30.021 --> 01:25:32.403
I don't think these
people are real.

01:25:32.817 --> 01:25:34.577
I don't think you're real.

01:25:35.337 --> 01:25:37.270
At least the real Amy that I
used to know.

01:25:43.931 --> 01:25:45.416
[wind]

01:26:05.677 --> 01:26:07.438
I thought I had you there.

01:26:08.887 --> 01:26:11.027
- Now what?
- Well now I,

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.547
send you back to whatever
hell you crawled out from.

01:26:13.685 --> 01:26:16.067
[Amy laughing]

01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:18.345
And how are you going
to do that?

01:26:18.483 --> 01:26:20.727
Well...I have a secret plan.

01:26:22.522 --> 01:26:23.937
Did you want to hear it?

01:26:24.731 --> 01:26:26.284
Please.

01:26:26.905 --> 01:26:28.321

Where's the recording?

01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:45.432
You're never going to get it.

I forged the hell you
want to send me to.

01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:42.662
I breathed life into all
the beings that took
your friends.

01:28:43.835 --> 01:28:46.182
You never stood a chance.

01:28:47.494 --> 01:28:48.530
Fuck.

01:28:48.668 --> 01:28:52.016
You brought it, you fool.

01:28:55.916 --> 01:28:57.677
With this...

01:28:57.815 --> 01:29:00.852
I'll unleash an army of Nkisi

01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:03.338
to take over the world.

01:29:05.995 --> 01:29:08.308

Your human weapons

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.912
They can't, but this can.

01:29:31.573 --> 01:29:33.195
This is not possible.

01:29:33.678 --> 01:29:35.922
- How!
- Well like you said,

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.924
my human weapons can't hurt you.

01:29:38.062 --> 01:29:40.651
So I had to find something
that can kick your ass.

- No.
- That's right, baby.

[upbeat jazzy music]

01:30:01.672 --> 01:30:04.260
Welcome to the Mystic Museum,
fellow travelers,

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.849
home of oddities and strange
artifacts.

01:30:08.575 --> 01:30:11.613
- So what can I do for you?
- Are you the man
they call El Jefe?

01:30:12.683 --> 01:30:14.754
Haven't heard that in a
long time.

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:17.826
But yes,
I used to go by that name.

01:30:17.964 --> 01:30:20.967
We find ourselves
in a situation in which

01:30:21.105 --> 01:30:24.004
we might need some
sort of protection.

01:30:24.142 --> 01:30:26.110
Well you've come
to the right place.

01:30:26.248 --> 01:30:31.356
We have all sorts of amulets,
anything from chicken feed
to sage,

01:30:31.495 --> 01:30:33.945
protection from pretty much
anything you can think of.

01:30:34.083 --> 01:30:35.913
What if it's not for protection?

01:30:37.777 --> 01:30:39.399
What if we want to fight back?

01:30:39.537 --> 01:30:41.436
You're already in trouble,
aren't you?

01:30:42.954 --> 01:30:45.336
This thing that's come for you.
What is it?

01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:48.546
An angry ghost, a werewolf?

01:30:48.684 --> 01:30:50.790
- Bigger.
- Demons?

01:30:51.411 --> 01:30:53.137
- Bigger.
- The Devil?

01:30:53.413 --> 01:30:55.001
Satan himself.

01:30:55.139 --> 01:30:56.968
Maybe take it down a notch.

01:30:57.106 --> 01:30:58.176
This thing.

01:30:59.074 --> 01:31:00.351

Fucking Cubans.

01:31:12.018 --> 01:31:14.952
[El Jefe] What's coming for you
has been around a lot longer
than we have.

01:31:15.090 --> 01:31:16.712
Our weapons cannot hurt it.

01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:19.991
Only a weapon from its realm
can send it back to it.

01:31:21.268 --> 01:31:23.478
And I happen to have
such a weapon.

01:31:23.995 --> 01:31:26.204
- It's as good as you say
we'll take it.
- Yeah.

01:31:26.342 --> 01:31:28.690
We trust you man but we don't
have time for backstories.

01:31:28.828 --> 01:31:30.485
Back when I was younger,

01:31:31.347 --> 01:31:33.108
I started traveling the world

01:31:33.246 --> 01:31:35.213
trying to figure out who I was.

01:31:35.351 --> 01:31:38.078
So I grabbed the backpack,
some clothes,

01:31:38.216 --> 01:31:40.564
- my pet parakeet, Winokee.
- Nice.

01:31:40.702 --> 01:31:43.014
And that's how I wound up
in Zanzibar.

01:31:44.015 --> 01:31:45.258
I heard about a being

01:31:45.914 --> 01:31:48.019
an entity that reveals
the real you.

01:31:48.157 --> 01:31:52.645
So I took a leap of faith
and went to seek The Popobawa.

01:31:53.473 --> 01:31:54.612
The Popobawa.

01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.441
Yes, The Popobawa.

01:31:57.235 --> 01:31:58.582
A very powerful demon.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.100
Oh. Yeah.

01:32:00.238 --> 01:32:02.931
So I performed a ceremony
to summon him.

01:32:03.069 --> 01:32:05.830
So the third night
I saw him for the first time,

01:32:06.555 --> 01:32:08.453
he blended with the darkness.

01:32:09.144 --> 01:32:11.664
His sweaty skin
glistening in the moonlight.

01:32:12.803 --> 01:32:15.426
He stood by the doorway
staring at me.

01:32:15.564 --> 01:32:16.876
I couldn't move.

01:32:17.014 --> 01:32:18.533
I was hypnotized.

01:32:18.981 --> 01:32:21.501
I managed,
to utter a single phrase,

01:32:22.053 --> 01:32:23.330
show me.

01:32:25.194 --> 01:32:27.024
And in a blink he was on
top of me.

01:32:28.853 --> 01:32:30.096
El Jefe, that's a wild story
but we--

01:32:30.234 --> 01:32:31.960
And then he penetrated me.

01:32:32.098 --> 01:32:33.340
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

01:32:33.478 --> 01:32:35.757
He held me down with his
powerful arms.

01:32:35.895 --> 01:32:38.622
And he thrust himself inside of
me over and over,

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.625
bringing me closer and closer
to who I was meant to be.

01:32:42.073 --> 01:32:44.524
He made me feel things
that I never felt before.

01:32:44.662 --> 01:32:46.906
It was like a rainbow
exploded inside of me.

01:32:47.044 --> 01:32:48.355
Yeah. Okay.

01:32:48.493 --> 01:32:50.634
And when it was finally
done, he left

01:32:51.289 --> 01:32:53.429
and my heart was pounding
in my chest.

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.984
My lungs were screaming
for oxygen,

01:32:56.501 --> 01:33:00.713
and my body overflowed with his
energizing, demonic residue.

01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:03.198
Okay, but I still had doubts,

01:33:05.027 --> 01:33:07.374
- so I summoned him again.
- You...

01:33:07.616 --> 01:33:09.238
you summoned the demon again?

01:33:09.376 --> 01:33:10.723
Yes. There was a lot of
summoning.

01:33:10.861 --> 01:33:13.449
So for 19 nights
I continued to summon him,

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.797
and for 19 nights
the demon came to me

01:33:15.935 --> 01:33:17.730
and each night
I felt like he was digging

01:33:17.868 --> 01:33:20.284
deeper inside of me
to reveal who I really am.

01:33:20.422 --> 01:33:24.046
Yeah, man, this really doesn't
sound like it was a demon.

01:33:24.184 --> 01:33:25.461
No!

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.911
It was a demon.

01:33:27.429 --> 01:33:29.638
A powerful demon.

01:33:29.776 --> 01:33:31.675
He knew about my past.

01:33:31.813 --> 01:33:33.918
You've been a bad boy he
would tell me,

01:33:34.574 --> 01:33:35.679
and he was right.

01:33:35.817 --> 01:33:37.853
I needed to be punished.

01:33:37.991 --> 01:33:40.545
You should have heard the filthy

muscular embrace

01:33:56.216 --> 01:33:58.840
keeping me waiting for hours.

01:33:58.978 --> 01:34:00.773
And then he stopped showing
up at all.

01:34:00.911 --> 01:34:04.052
So I started adding
sacrifices to the ceremonies.

01:34:04.190 --> 01:34:08.332
I filled the shack with flowers
and, and chicken heads to bring
him back.

Winokee had to go.

01:34:27.075 --> 01:34:30.009
He didn't even mention that I
was wearing the shirt that he
said he liked.

01:34:31.493 --> 01:34:33.012
So I confronted him, I said,

01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:34.738

I was the one that called him.

01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:50.581
He said he could only stay for a
little while because he was
super busy

01:34:50.823 --> 01:34:52.894
and that things were
moving too fast.

01:34:54.102 --> 01:34:56.345
Then I found out.

01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:59.486
Well, it turns out that
the Popobawa had been around
for a very long time

01:34:59.901 --> 01:35:02.489
and, that he would just come to
any man that would call him.

01:35:02.869 --> 01:35:05.872
Yeah, well, no wonder
you were so tired, Mr. Popo.

01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:09.600

special, you know,
I thought I was the only one,

01:35:09.738 --> 01:35:11.395
but,

01:35:11.533 --> 01:35:14.743
no, he had that entire island
under his seductive grip.

01:35:16.745 --> 01:35:18.678
So I had to free them.

01:35:19.886 --> 01:35:22.924

not go in vain.

01:35:23.579 --> 01:35:25.098

I could find.

01:35:36.627 --> 01:35:38.560

01:35:39.319 --> 01:35:42.944

his despicable evil.
