00:01.841 --> 00:02.774
Hi.

00:02.809 --> 00:05.743
Whoo, flowers. Who are they from?

00:05.795 --> 00:06.911
- Peter.
- Don't want 'em.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.830
After you told me how
he acted that night,

00:08.882 --> 00:11.833
the only person I want drunkenly
passing out on the couch is Yolanda.

00:11.835 --> 00:16.888
Actually, these are for me for me
for writing that review for him.

00:16.923 --> 00:21.759
Aw, well, he should have sent a
maid for what he did to our bathroom.

00:21.811 --> 00:24.679
Oh my god. Gabi...

00:24.731 --> 00:26.898
his editor thought the
article was so good,

00:26.933 --> 00:30.935
Peter got me a gig! I'm writing
an article for an indie music blog!

00:30.987 --> 00:33.855
Here are the tickets!
I can't believe it!

00:33.907 --> 00:36.774
Now I'm the cool music journalist!

00:36.826 --> 00:39.827
That's so great, look
at you, with your words!

00:39.863 --> 00:41.946
I know! And I had so much
fun writing that review.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.749
And turns out... I'm really good at it!

00:44.784 --> 00:45.917
Sofia, maybe this is your thing!

00:45.952 --> 00:47.869
- Oh my god! I have a thing!
- You have a thing!

00:47.871 --> 00:48.870
- I have a thing!
- You're a writer!

00:48.922 --> 00:50.922
Aah! Who knew?

00:50.957 --> 00:52.707
My mom!

00:52.759 --> 00:54.709
You know what, Gabi?

00:54.761 --> 00:56.928
Maybe your mom wasn't
leading you to your soul mate.

00:56.963 --> 00:59.714
Maybe she was leading me to my passion.

00:59.716 --> 01:01.799
Ohh... that's so sweet.

01:01.851 --> 01:04.852
Still single down here, Mom!

01:04.888 --> 01:05.803
(squeals)

01:08.208 --> 01:09.690
What are these?

01:09.726 --> 01:11.742
Hm, grapes.

01:11.795 --> 01:12.794
Those are grapes, yeah.

01:12.796 --> 01:14.679
Just put that in there
and let them ferment,

01:14.714 --> 01:15.713
and then make Grandma some wine.

01:18.718 --> 01:20.017
Hey, Mom.

01:20.053 --> 01:22.036
(gasps) Oh. Benjamin Wheeler,

01:22.071 --> 01:25.907
you are going to drop to
your knees and thank me.

01:25.942 --> 01:27.992
There is literally nothing you
could say that would make me do that.

01:28.027 --> 01:29.010
Mm-hmm.

01:29.062 --> 01:30.962
Emma is officially potty-trained!

01:32.015 --> 01:34.665
- Oh, my god, thank you!
- Yes!

01:35.885 --> 01:37.785
I never thought this day would come.

01:37.837 --> 01:38.970
How'd you do it?

01:39.005 --> 01:41.656
I didn't. That tip money
you did on your dresser did.

01:43.126 --> 01:45.159
Turns out, the kid likes cash.

01:45.161 --> 01:46.928
(phone rings)

01:47.981 --> 01:48.980
Where's my phone?

01:49.015 --> 01:50.081
Uh, more importantly, where's Emma?

01:50.133 --> 01:51.098
(toilet flushes)

01:51.134 --> 01:53.851
Oh, no. Emma! Emma!

01:53.887 --> 01:55.970
Emma... Oh,
god... No!

01:56.022 --> 01:57.788
My phone!

01:58.808 --> 02:00.775
My bad, I couldn't potty-train her

02:00.810 --> 02:01.943
but I did teach her
flushing things is funny.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.710
Oh, no, I promise.

02:19.746 --> 02:20.795
I won't tell anybody.

02:21.915 --> 02:23.664
I have to tell somebody.

02:24.751 --> 02:25.750
Oh, Emma.

02:25.802 --> 02:27.668
You're not gonna believe
what just happened.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.886
Have you ever heard of Elena Rios?

02:31.975 --> 02:33.758
Yeah, me either.

02:33.810 --> 02:36.844
But she's a giant movie star in Spain

02:36.846 --> 02:39.730
and she's got a huge movie opening here.

02:39.766 --> 02:41.849
And her manager thinks that it
might help her get more press

02:41.901 --> 02:44.685
if she pretends to date
a famous American athlete.

02:44.737 --> 02:46.687
I guess they couldn't find
one, so they called me!

02:48.775 --> 02:50.775
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

02:50.827 --> 02:51.909
You're thinking about
Aunt Riley, aren't you?

02:53.863 --> 02:56.747
Well, I haven't told you this,
but we aren't dating right now.

02:56.783 --> 02:58.783
Plus this whole thing with Elena

02:58.835 --> 02:59.867
is strictly professional.

02:59.919 --> 03:01.786
It's just for publicity.

03:01.838 --> 03:02.870
Hey, dude, what's going on?

03:02.872 --> 03:05.756
Oh, um, Emma was just
explaining her story.

03:05.792 --> 03:06.841
So let me get this straight,

03:06.876 --> 03:08.759
he huffed, then he puffed,

03:08.795 --> 03:10.711
then he blew the house down?

03:11.798 --> 03:12.880
Got it.

03:12.882 --> 03:14.632
See ya, Ben.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.770
It's nice that Danny has someone
to talk to about literature.

03:23.893 --> 03:26.694
Hey, Tuck, how'd it go?

03:26.729 --> 03:28.813
Did your super hot producer
Julia agree to go out with me?

03:28.865 --> 03:30.731
She did. She did,

03:30.783 --> 03:32.900
but remember, man, I
work with this girl.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.869
Okay, so don't be too...

03:34.904 --> 03:36.704
you.

03:37.740 --> 03:39.707
Dude, you have nothing to fear, okay?

03:39.742 --> 03:40.875
I will be
polite, mature...

03:40.910 --> 03:42.710
What the hell?

03:42.745 --> 03:44.829
- Huh?
- That's Danny.

03:44.881 --> 03:46.747
On a date, with a movie star.

03:47.967 --> 03:50.835
What? Read your phone,
join the 21st century.

03:51.921 --> 03:53.721
Hey, guys.

03:53.756 --> 03:54.805
Yo, seriously, bro?

03:54.841 --> 03:56.841
- Elena Rios?
- Why didn't you tell us?

03:56.893 --> 03:57.925
So not a big deal.

03:57.927 --> 03:59.760
Uh-huh, yeah it is!

03:59.812 --> 04:00.845
Dude, look at the headline.

04:00.897 --> 04:03.731
It says, "This is such a big deal."

04:03.766 --> 04:06.651
God, I can't believe I thought
Riley was the best you could do.

04:06.686 --> 04:07.685
Congrats, bro.

04:09.906 --> 04:13.691
How could you not tell me that
you're dating a movie star, man?

04:13.743 --> 04:15.776
If I ever want to make it
on the entertainment desk,

04:15.828 --> 04:17.745
this is the kind of
story I need to break.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.697
Look, I'm trying to do something
important with my life, okay?

04:20.750 --> 04:21.781
Something that matters.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.834
Celebrity news.

04:23.870 --> 04:24.869
All right,

04:24.921 --> 04:27.705
just give me a piece of
exclusive information,

04:27.757 --> 04:28.756
like how'd you two meet?

04:28.791 --> 04:30.675
Oh, um...

04:30.710 --> 04:32.677
it's a long story.

04:32.712 --> 04:34.795
I had it written down, I'll go get it.

04:37.700 --> 04:40.735
Thanks for finally inviting me
to the cool girls lunch, ladies.

04:40.787 --> 04:43.721
I'm so tired of eating
with those HR gals.

04:43.773 --> 04:47.658
Apparently, everything I
say is offensive or racist.

04:47.694 --> 04:48.943
(scoffs) Narcs.

04:50.079 --> 04:51.979
To being young and single.

04:52.015 --> 04:53.047
Uh-huh, well,

04:53.082 --> 04:54.982
one of us is just young.

04:55.018 --> 04:58.836
But not as young as my husband, Brad.

04:58.888 --> 05:01.756
He's got a face that will
make you believe in God,

05:01.791 --> 05:04.141
and an ass that will make
you believe in the devil.

05:04.177 --> 05:05.826
I hear the sizzle.

05:05.828 --> 05:07.061
Where's the steak?

05:07.096 --> 05:08.996
Show these chicks some pics.

05:09.032 --> 05:10.665
Oh, well, here's the thing,

05:10.667 --> 05:13.651
my granddaughter flushed
my phone down the toilet.

05:13.686 --> 05:16.987
Makes you wish for the old days when
you could just pull it out by the cord.

05:17.023 --> 05:19.990
Like you pulled that story
just now out of your ass?

05:22.845 --> 05:23.844
No.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.862
No, I swear.

05:24.897 --> 05:26.881
I mean, I would bring him to the office,

05:26.916 --> 05:28.733
but he's off traveling the world.

05:28.768 --> 05:29.850
(laughing)

05:29.902 --> 05:31.752
A spiritual quest.

05:32.805 --> 05:35.072
Finding himself.

05:35.124 --> 05:37.641
I think I'm gonna find
myself the ladies room.

05:37.677 --> 05:40.077
Yeah. I'm gonna take this,
sometimes there's a line.

05:42.031 --> 05:43.114
What did I tell you?

05:43.149 --> 05:45.933
She is a compulsive liar. I honestly

05:45.985 --> 05:47.935
think that she's pathological.

05:47.970 --> 05:50.020
Like she's got a hot younger husband,

05:50.056 --> 05:52.907
and I don't like cats.

05:52.942 --> 05:54.984
But I guess when you
have no self-esteem and

05:55.010 --> 05:56.844
you're just desperate
to impress people,

05:56.846 --> 05:58.662
- then you...
- Excuse me, ladies.

05:58.698 --> 06:00.097
Have any of you seen Bonnie Wheeler?

06:00.133 --> 06:02.032
I'm her husband, Brad.

06:02.068 --> 06:04.135
I'm back from traveling the world.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.687
You're Bonnie's husband?

06:06.723 --> 06:08.038
That is what I just said, isn't it?

06:09.092 --> 06:11.025
We're Bonnie's co-workers.

06:11.077 --> 06:15.029
I'm Judy, but you can call
me any time you want to.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.947
That's great.

06:16.999 --> 06:19.734
She's told me so much about all of you.

06:19.769 --> 06:20.785
Especially you.

06:20.820 --> 06:21.886
She said you're the nicest.

06:23.740 --> 06:25.673
Anyways, I should go
find her. Enjoy your meal.

06:27.744 --> 06:28.809
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

06:28.861 --> 06:30.628
What?

06:30.663 --> 06:31.629
I think I just did something weird.

06:36.119 --> 06:38.018
Oh, Riley. Yo, what's up?

06:38.054 --> 06:39.637
Ugh, god, I don't know.

06:39.689 --> 06:41.122
Work's just a whole lot
of awkward right now.

06:41.157 --> 06:43.090
I got assigned to this case with Ross,

06:43.092 --> 06:45.993
and I think he must have heard
that I broke up with Danny,

06:46.028 --> 06:48.045
because he keeps suggesting that
we have lunch and I don't know...

06:48.097 --> 06:50.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:50.883 --> 06:53.851
I didn't really need an answer.

06:53.903 --> 06:57.838
But, you know, I am glad to see that
you're thinking about dating again.

06:57.890 --> 07:01.759
'Cause I'm sure you heard that Danny's
dating the hottest woman on the planet.

07:02.862 --> 07:04.678
Oh, my!

07:04.714 --> 07:05.763
Tell me everything you know.

07:05.798 --> 07:08.983
Wait, you didn't know that
Danny was dating Elena Rios?

07:09.035 --> 07:10.634
Elena Rios?

07:12.021 --> 07:14.088
Who's Elena Rios? I've
never heard of her.

07:14.123 --> 07:16.857
Well, you will if you
watch my broadcast tonight.

07:17.910 --> 07:19.960
Oh, my god, I
just... I just...

07:19.996 --> 07:22.980
I just thought that Danny and I
would have worked things out by now.

07:23.015 --> 07:26.884
I'm waiting for him to finally
apologize and admit that he was wrong

07:26.919 --> 07:29.737
so we can just fall back
into each other's arms

07:29.772 --> 07:32.756
and go back to making other people feel
bad about not being as in love as we are.

07:34.777 --> 07:37.645
Riley, I'm sorry that
I'm the one that told you.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.679
It's okay.

07:38.731 --> 07:40.631
I'll be okay eventually.

07:40.666 --> 07:43.067
Yeah, well I'm not gonna be
okay, you just broke my spine.

07:47.974 --> 07:50.107
I just can't believe that Tucker set
you up with me instead of himself.

07:50.159 --> 07:52.893
Well, I think it would
have been hard for him

07:52.945 --> 07:54.995
after I saw him strike
out with the donut girl,

07:54.997 --> 07:56.981
the graphics girl, and the coffee girl.

07:58.868 --> 08:00.768
But, if you miss him so much,

08:00.820 --> 08:01.902
he can come on our second date.

08:01.938 --> 08:04.672
Oh, a second date.

08:04.724 --> 08:06.140
Guess I didn't do as bad as I thought.

08:06.175 --> 08:09.710
Or maybe I should have had
that second glass of wine.

08:09.762 --> 08:11.695
Hey, works for me.

08:11.731 --> 08:13.614
Last chance to back out.

08:17.670 --> 08:18.969
No, I'm definitely good.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.073
Riley?

08:23.125 --> 08:24.892
Ross?

08:24.927 --> 08:25.843
Really?

08:26.996 --> 08:29.763
What? Just a little date.

08:29.815 --> 08:31.866
Dating. Me and Ross.

08:31.918 --> 08:33.851
We're... on a date.

08:33.885 --> 08:37.738
So feel free to share that
information with everyone.

08:39.692 --> 08:40.924
This is a date?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.727
I would have worn a more exciting
tie if I knew it was a date.

08:45.114 --> 08:46.697
I'm excited about your tie.

08:46.749 --> 08:48.048
Excuse me, can we get this to go?

08:50.036 --> 08:51.118
Have fun, kids.

08:53.973 --> 08:55.956
(chattering quietly)

08:59.946 --> 09:01.328
Ben: Hey, Mom.

09:01.364 --> 09:04.748
Sorry I'm late, but if it's any
consolation, I just had the best date.

09:04.784 --> 09:05.866
Yeah, I heard.

09:05.918 --> 09:07.701
What you talking about?

09:07.737 --> 09:09.703
I'm talking about the fact
that I'm married to a cheater.

09:10.740 --> 09:11.672
Brad cheated on you?

09:12.775 --> 09:13.774
No.

09:13.776 --> 09:15.593
You did!

09:17.680 --> 09:19.964
Well, in all fairness, we
never said we were exclusive.

09:25.281 --> 09:26.530
Oh, yeah, and the flower?

09:27.566 --> 09:28.799
Riley and Ross!

09:28.834 --> 09:32.486
I just saw Riley and Ross on a
date together. With each other.

09:32.521 --> 09:33.520
Uh...

09:33.522 --> 09:35.539
Yeah, man. Yeah, sorry about that.

09:35.591 --> 09:37.357
Why are you sorry?

09:37.393 --> 09:39.326
What? No reason.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.478
You pushed those together, man, not me.

09:41.513 --> 09:43.247
I did?

09:43.282 --> 09:44.381
Yeah.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.284
The newspaper, I mean, you
moving on with Elena Rios.

09:47.319 --> 09:48.318
Man, this is all your fault.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.337
Okay, I'm completely off the hook here.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.273
I mean, not with you, with
something at work, but who cares?

09:53.325 --> 09:54.341
Man, you're dating Elena.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.526
Doesn't count, it's not real.

09:57.563 --> 09:58.528
Wait a minute.

09:59.548 --> 10:00.681
What do you mean it's not real?

10:00.716 --> 10:03.500
Uh... did I say not real?

10:03.535 --> 10:06.403
I meant to say not real
fun yet, but you cut me off.

10:06.438 --> 10:07.487
Stop cutting me off, dude.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.488
Oh, no, no, no.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.340
You are not changing the subject, man.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.508
If you do not tell me the truth...

10:13.529 --> 10:15.429
I mean, there's not much
I can threaten you with,

10:15.464 --> 10:17.447
so please, man, just tell me the truth.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.216
Fine.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.301
The truth is it's
just a publicity stunt.

10:21.303 --> 10:22.352
We aren't really dating.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.654
You happy?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.423
What?

10:26.458 --> 10:29.593
Dude, I'm covering this premiere because
I told them that you two were dating.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.628
And I could get a juicy
interview, and now you're...

10:31.664 --> 10:33.580
now you're telling me
that you're fake dating?

10:35.501 --> 10:37.501
This is so much better.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.453
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no. You can't tell anyone.

10:39.455 --> 10:41.571
Nobody has this story, man,
this could be my big break.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.341
No, Tucker, please, don't say a word.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.425
I'm asking you as a friend.

10:46.528 --> 10:48.295
Really?

10:48.330 --> 10:50.364
The friend card?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.733
You know you only get to use that
once. You sure you want to use that now?

10:52.768 --> 10:54.351
Yes.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.369
Dammit!

10:55.404 --> 10:57.287
Shouldn't have wasted
mine on a sandwich.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.275
Hey, Emma.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.543
Can we talk?

11:04.630 --> 11:06.613
I can't believe Ross is back with Riley.

11:06.649 --> 11:07.698
I mean,

11:07.733 --> 11:10.517
I should probably just
give up on us already.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.619
Riley's obviously moved on.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.604
I might as well move on too.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.341
You agree?

11:18.394 --> 11:19.359
Yes.

11:19.395 --> 11:21.395
Great, I'm telling
people it was your idea.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.732
(sighs)

11:26.785 --> 11:28.385
Riley! Ross!

11:28.420 --> 11:30.320
Hey, man, how you been?

11:30.356 --> 11:31.405
Hey, Tucker. Good.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.774
Wow, that is a nice looking
briefcase you got there.

11:33.809 --> 11:36.326
I'm actually in the market for
one of these myself. You mind?

11:36.378 --> 11:39.613
Wow. Wow, it's nice, it's light, even.

11:39.648 --> 11:40.731
Handles a little bit slippery though.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.532
Oh, snap!

11:42.568 --> 11:43.717
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Oh, man! My fault.

11:43.769 --> 11:46.486
Let me get the door, man. Whoops!

11:50.542 --> 11:52.559
Okay, do you want to
tell me what's going on

11:52.594 --> 11:55.495
or should I be working on what I should
tell the police when they can't find you?

11:57.433 --> 12:00.717
So, um, Riles, any
chance you're dating Ross

12:00.753 --> 12:03.754
just because I told you that
Danny's dating Elena Rios?

12:03.789 --> 12:06.640
What? No!

12:06.692 --> 12:08.709
That's so... what?

12:08.744 --> 12:10.627
Hoo! Okay.

12:10.679 --> 12:12.279
That is a relief.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.697
Okay, 'cause, you know, their
relationship's not even real.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.632
What? What? What do you
mean, it's not even real?

12:15.684 --> 12:18.452
Oh, it's totally fake.
It's all for the cameras.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.388
- What kind of reporter are you?
- Oh, hello no!

12:22.441 --> 12:24.458
(forced laughter)

12:24.460 --> 12:26.309
I mean,

12:26.361 --> 12:27.444
it honestly happens all the time.

12:27.479 --> 12:29.329
But that's life when
you have a twin brother.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.398
God made two of them.

12:32.735 --> 12:35.302
That's us. I love this picture.

12:35.304 --> 12:36.353
It's real...

12:37.406 --> 12:38.622
it's real.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.641
Twin brother, huh?

12:41.693 --> 12:43.627
Do you think he'd go out with me?

12:44.730 --> 12:46.530
I don't know.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.498
He'd definitely go out with you.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.617
Oh! (forced laugh)

12:50.652 --> 12:52.502
I think we need more drinks.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.554
Brad, sweetie, why don't
you get us some refills.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.324
And feel free to take your time. Okay?

12:57.376 --> 12:58.475
Great idea.

12:58.510 --> 12:59.426
(both groan)

13:02.798 --> 13:05.398
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

13:05.434 --> 13:06.383
How's he in the sack?

13:08.303 --> 13:11.288
Oh, he is amaz... (gags)

13:12.724 --> 13:14.641
He is just awesome.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.543
He is okay.

13:19.515 --> 13:21.581
Oh, my god. Thank god. Ah, thank god.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.518
It's my son, New York
Ranger, Danny Wheeler.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.587
Did I mention that he is
dating rising star Elena Rios?

13:27.623 --> 13:30.323
Are you really dating Elena Rios?

13:30.375 --> 13:32.359
I love her!

13:32.394 --> 13:35.328
Yep. I'm escorting her to
her movie premiere tomorrow.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.315
Hey, if you're such a big fan, why don't
you come to the premiere with my mom?

13:38.350 --> 13:39.366
I've got tons of extra tickets.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.767
- No, honey, actually I think...
- Oh, I'd love to come!

13:40.803 --> 13:42.435
- All right.
- Oh!

13:42.437 --> 13:44.754
If you don't mind me third-wheeling
with you and your husband?

13:44.790 --> 13:46.723
Oh, is Brad back?

13:46.758 --> 13:49.493
Cool! I love him.

13:49.528 --> 13:50.544
He's like a brother to me.

13:58.453 --> 14:00.337
And that's how you do a fake kiss.

14:00.389 --> 14:02.355
But on camera, it will look muy real.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.308
Felt pretty real to me.

14:06.461 --> 14:07.394
Everywhere.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.633
You know, we don't have
to fake this, Elena.

14:13.669 --> 14:14.684
I like you.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.236
For real.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:25.647 --> 14:27.414
What was that?

14:28.483 --> 14:30.534
"The sound of two souls
crashing together."

14:30.586 --> 14:33.436
It's a line from my movie.

14:33.488 --> 14:35.288
I know it's not very good.

14:40.869 --> 14:42.202
Oh, Danny, hey!

14:42.237 --> 14:44.187
Uh, you remember Ross?

14:44.222 --> 14:46.106
I remember punching Ross.

14:46.141 --> 14:47.123
Ross.

14:47.175 --> 14:48.224
Danny.

14:48.226 --> 14:50.026
Ross.

14:52.047 --> 14:53.063
Danny.

14:54.199 --> 14:56.032
Take it you two are an item again?

14:56.068 --> 14:57.968
You take it right.

14:57.970 --> 15:01.037
But that shouldn't bother
someone dating Elena Rios.

15:01.039 --> 15:04.024
Really? Oh, my god,
she's gorg... Ow!

15:04.076 --> 15:05.842
That was my rib.

15:05.877 --> 15:08.812
Well, I gotta go get changed
for Elena's big premiere.

15:08.814 --> 15:10.797
But, you know, I can get you
guys tickets if you want to come.

15:10.832 --> 15:11.915
- Oh, no, I don't...
- We'll be there.

15:13.268 --> 15:14.234
So will I.

15:18.223 --> 15:21.791
Look, is it me, or are you just
dating me to make Danny jealous?

15:21.827 --> 15:25.078
(sighs) Ross...

15:25.130 --> 15:26.819
if you're going to continue
to be so insecure,

15:26.845 --> 15:28.173
I don't know if we're
gonna make it.

15:31.119 --> 15:32.969
Can't believe I have to do this.

15:32.971 --> 15:35.038
Please. I saw your last girlfriend.

15:35.073 --> 15:36.957
I'm so much hotter than her.

15:37.009 --> 15:38.858
My last girlfriend was Riley.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.927
Exactly.

15:40.963 --> 15:43.847
Fine, whatever. I'll walk down
the red carpet with you and Judy,

15:43.849 --> 15:44.931
but I got another date
with Julie tonight,

15:44.967 --> 15:46.416
so I'm going to roll
before the credits do.

15:46.418 --> 15:49.185
When you walk into work on Monday,
you can tell them you met someone else.

15:49.187 --> 15:50.203
Who?

15:50.238 --> 15:52.088
I don't know, how about
your actual husband, Brad?

15:53.325 --> 15:55.125
Oh, that's good.

15:58.063 --> 15:59.996
Tucker! Tucker!

15:59.998 --> 16:01.031
Just remember,

16:01.066 --> 16:02.999
you only get one question with Elena.

16:03.035 --> 16:04.317
So it better be amazing.

16:04.369 --> 16:06.102
Hey, yeah, I was just gonna, you
know, ask her about the movie.

16:06.138 --> 16:07.971
Maybe what's her favorite scene?

16:08.006 --> 16:09.906
No, don't ask her about the movie.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.841
No one cares about the movie.

16:11.893 --> 16:13.810
People want dirt.

16:13.862 --> 16:16.896
That means grab that little
shovel you call a microphone

16:16.932 --> 16:17.947
and start digging.

16:17.983 --> 16:19.866
Well, I...

16:19.918 --> 16:22.852
I mean, I kinda do sorta
know this one big secret.

16:22.888 --> 16:24.237
But I'd have to betray my friend.

16:24.289 --> 16:27.257
Pfft, Tucker, you work in television.

16:27.259 --> 16:29.125
You have no friends.

16:30.128 --> 16:31.227
You need to be heartless.

16:31.263 --> 16:34.164
Look at me. My grandmother just died.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.131
Nothing!

16:38.036 --> 16:39.002
Paparazzi: Over here, please!

16:39.004 --> 16:41.004
Just hold my hand and stop complaining.

16:41.006 --> 16:43.907
You're the one that told them we
were married in the first place.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.875
Which isn't even believable.

16:45.911 --> 16:48.828
Danny, I could see, but
you? I mean, come on.

16:49.881 --> 16:52.282
Ben, Ben, hey. Have you seen Danny?

16:52.317 --> 16:53.917
Did she just call you Ben?

16:53.952 --> 16:57.237
Oh, she calls everybody
Ben since the accident.

16:57.272 --> 16:58.288
You know, steel plate. (clicks tongue)

16:59.858 --> 17:01.224
My name is Brad and
I'm married to my mom.

17:01.226 --> 17:02.208
Got it.

17:02.244 --> 17:04.094
And I'm dating Ross for
all the right reasons.

17:05.230 --> 17:07.163
I mean, this is actually kind of fun.

17:07.165 --> 17:09.949
This is the easy part. Get
ready for the interviews.

17:09.984 --> 17:11.835
And if you don't know what to say,

17:11.887 --> 17:13.036
just say, "What a magical night."

17:13.070 --> 17:14.904
I know that's what everyone says,

17:14.906 --> 17:17.240
but I'm an actress, no
one's expecting much.

17:21.930 --> 17:24.196
Oh, my god. (scoffs)

17:24.249 --> 17:25.799
Can you believe them?

17:31.223 --> 17:34.224
Them, I believe. It's us I'm
having a little trouble with.

17:37.062 --> 17:38.995
What was I thinking,
inviting Riley and Ross?

17:38.997 --> 17:40.046
They look so in love.

17:40.082 --> 17:41.931
Now I'm never gonna get back together.

17:41.983 --> 17:45.034
Well, maybe she's just faking it
with Ross the way you are with Elena.

17:45.087 --> 17:46.953
I'm not faking it with Elena now.

17:46.988 --> 17:51.858
But, do you think if she found out that
Elena and I were definitely faking it,

17:51.893 --> 17:53.827
that she'd break up with Ross
and get back together with me.

17:53.879 --> 17:55.044
How would she find that out?

17:55.097 --> 17:57.831
Because you're gonna say that
our relationship's fake on TV.

17:57.866 --> 17:59.132
Really?

17:59.167 --> 18:00.800
You're gonna let me ask?

18:00.836 --> 18:02.235
This could make my career!

18:02.287 --> 18:05.171
Thank you, Danny.

18:05.223 --> 18:08.024
When I become famous, I will
not forget what you've done.

18:09.161 --> 18:10.160
Yeah, I probably will.

18:12.180 --> 18:13.947
Riley,

18:13.982 --> 18:15.915
this is ridiculous.

18:15.967 --> 18:18.101
You haven't taken your
eyes off of Danny and Elena.

18:18.103 --> 18:19.869
- Wh... (chuckles)
- Look,

18:19.905 --> 18:23.006
I really like you, but
this is obviously a rebound.

18:23.008 --> 18:24.824
No! No...

18:24.860 --> 18:26.242
Riley, Riley, I don't
want to be that guy.

18:27.813 --> 18:29.195
This is important. You
mean something to me.

18:30.916 --> 18:32.148
Okay.

18:32.184 --> 18:33.783
Okay. I'm...

18:33.819 --> 18:36.202
I'm not over what happened with Danny,

18:36.238 --> 18:38.104
but I really, really want to be.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.123
So, if you just give me a chance,

18:40.158 --> 18:44.944
I promise I will move on and
we could see where this goes?

18:44.996 --> 18:47.046
I've always wanted to
see where this goes.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.050
And we are here with Elena Rios.

18:51.086 --> 18:54.921
Elena, I just have one teensy
little question for you.

18:54.956 --> 18:58.241
Is it true the you're a fake couple set up
by your managers just to help your career?

18:59.294 --> 19:01.211
What a magical night.

19:01.263 --> 19:03.146
Right, mi querido?

19:06.218 --> 19:09.118
Uh, Tucker's right, we
were set up for publicity.

19:09.171 --> 19:12.088
But, it turned out to be so much more.

19:16.144 --> 19:17.994
This is a hundred percent real.

19:24.085 --> 19:26.853
Well, in that case, what's your
favorite scene in the movie?

19:28.924 --> 19:30.890
Danny! There you are.

19:30.926 --> 19:33.793
Oh, whoa!

19:33.828 --> 19:35.845
I can't believe I didn't think
you could do better than Riley.

19:35.897 --> 19:37.230
Congrats, bro.

19:38.283 --> 19:40.133
Well, aren't you gonna introduce us?

19:40.168 --> 19:41.751
Oh, right, sorry.

19:41.803 --> 19:43.102
- This is Elena...
- Ben?

19:43.138 --> 19:45.071
Julia? What are you doing here?

19:45.106 --> 19:47.090
My job. What are you doing here?

19:47.142 --> 19:50.009
You know when people say
it's not what it looks like?

19:50.045 --> 19:51.945
That's never been more true than now.

19:53.031 --> 19:55.114
Brad, why does everybody
keep calling you Ben?

19:55.166 --> 19:57.000
Well, because that's his name.

19:57.002 --> 19:57.984
He's my brother.

19:58.019 --> 19:59.018
Brad's my step-dad.

19:59.070 --> 20:00.954
Your brother's your step-dad?

20:00.989 --> 20:03.890
No. He's not, right Mom?

20:04.993 --> 20:06.876
No, sweetie.

20:06.912 --> 20:08.895
You're pretending to
be married to your son.

20:08.930 --> 20:10.914
You're on a date with your mom?

20:10.949 --> 20:14.183
Yeah, but it looks like
we're about to break up, so...

20:14.219 --> 20:17.754
Oh, my god! I was in a
telenovela like this once.

20:17.789 --> 20:18.755
Someone's about to get shot.

20:20.792 --> 20:23.092
I knew you didn't have a hot husband.

20:23.128 --> 20:24.744
I do, I do, I do!

20:24.796 --> 20:27.063
- She does. She really does.
- Yes!

20:27.098 --> 20:28.485
Look, I only told you I
was my mom's husband

20:28.511 --> 20:29.749
because I heard what
you said about her.

20:29.784 --> 20:32.135
My mom's a lot of things,
but she's not a liar.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.186
Well...

20:33.221 --> 20:36.039
Okay, she's a liar.

20:36.074 --> 20:37.991
- But not about this one specific thing.
- Yes.

20:38.043 --> 20:41.894
Look, Judy, all I ever
wanted was to fit in.

20:41.930 --> 20:44.948
And you know you're
the office Queen Bee.

20:44.950 --> 20:48.084
And if you say I'm cool, then
I'm cool. So, what do you say?

20:48.119 --> 20:50.920
Oh, is that all you wanted?

20:50.956 --> 20:52.038
Why didn't you just ask?

20:52.090 --> 20:54.123
Oh, okay then.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.959
Can we be friends?

20:55.961 --> 20:58.962
Hell no! You are so going down.

20:58.964 --> 21:02.015
The girls in the office
are gonna love this story.

21:02.050 --> 21:04.017
Judy, wait.

21:04.052 --> 21:06.135
I extended you an olive branch

21:06.187 --> 21:09.138
and you responded with an act of war.

21:09.190 --> 21:12.892
(whispering) You have no
idea what you've done, Judy.

21:14.145 --> 21:16.029
This is all your fault.

21:16.064 --> 21:17.981
- (groans)
- Don't you walk away from me, Judy.

21:19.150 --> 21:21.985
Wow. Dad was a saint.

21:25.791 --> 21:27.725
Julia! Hey.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.660
So, about me and my mom,

21:29.695 --> 21:31.629
we're not actually dating.

21:31.664 --> 21:33.564
Funny. Neither are we.

21:33.599 --> 21:35.699
- Does that mean you don't want to go...
- No, I'm good.

21:35.735 --> 21:38.769
Hey, how many guys can you say
dumped their mom for you?

21:38.804 --> 21:40.671
No? Okay.

21:42.642 --> 21:45.743
So, guess I'm gonna change
back into my weatherman tie.

21:45.778 --> 21:47.611
How'd it go with Julia?

21:47.647 --> 21:48.712
Bad news.

21:48.748 --> 21:50.648
Remember when you said
not to be me?

21:51.784 --> 21:53.450
I was me.
