WEBVTT

00:16.862 --> 00:19.896
So, how are you faring
in your, uh...

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
repaying the Side Step debts?

00:22.103 --> 00:25.068
I-I knocked off, like, $400,

00:25.172 --> 00:26.482
so, you know,

00:26.586 --> 00:28.931
only about infinity left
to pay back Dad and Geri.

00:29.034 --> 00:30.827
You'll get there.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.896
<i>♪ I can help ya♪</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:34.551
<i>♪ If you need somebody...♪</i>

00:34.655 --> 00:36.344
So, what's with all
the traffic lately, huh?

00:36.448 --> 00:39.724
There's, like, trucks
and trailers and, like,

00:39.827 --> 00:41.931
- deliveries 24-7.
- Yeah, well,
you may recall

00:42.034 --> 00:43.758
that your uncle went
behind my back

00:43.862 --> 00:45.379
and opened up this damn circus.

00:45.482 --> 00:46.896
Oh, he's just the uncle now?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.551
Yeah, and maybe we'd have
some of this under control

00:49.655 --> 00:51.620
if anybody had bothered to come
to the family meeting

00:51.724 --> 00:52.862
that I called?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.206
I've been saying
that we don't have

00:54.310 --> 00:55.655
enough room out here
for all this, but...

00:55.758 --> 00:57.793
apparently this and that
is all being worked out

00:57.896 --> 01:00.344
and I just shouldn't
worry myself about it.

01:00.448 --> 01:02.137
I'm being put out
to damn pasture.

01:02.241 --> 01:03.586
You know, I...

01:03.689 --> 01:04.862
I might as well just take
an Alaskan cruise

01:04.965 --> 01:06.724
and drink myself to death.

01:06.827 --> 01:08.827
<i>♪ Yes, it would

01:08.931 --> 01:10.310
<i>♪ To do you good...♪</i>

01:10.413 --> 01:12.206
August, could you give us a sec?

01:12.310 --> 01:13.620
Yeah, yeah, got it.

01:15.344 --> 01:16.689
You have a nice day, honey.

01:16.793 --> 01:18.241
You, too.

01:20.827 --> 01:23.724
You know, I, um,
I noticed that your usual

01:23.827 --> 01:27.517
ranch morning routine has become
more of an evening deal

01:27.620 --> 01:28.862
as of late.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.172
Just staying out of the heat.

01:30.275 --> 01:32.620
It's been 70 degrees all week.

01:32.724 --> 01:35.448
Any chance this has to do
with Liam and Stella?

01:35.551 --> 01:36.551
So, what are you,
what are you saying?

01:36.655 --> 01:38.827
You're saying that I-I changed

01:38.931 --> 01:40.137
my whole work schedule around

01:40.241 --> 01:41.724
just to avoid
my son and granddaughter?

01:41.827 --> 01:43.206
That's ridiculous.

01:44.827 --> 01:46.517
I agree.

01:47.724 --> 01:50.137
Yes, yes, I hear you, but you
don't need to worry about it.

01:50.241 --> 01:51.965
I got it under control.

01:52.068 --> 01:55.000
That was an outlier,
we took care of it in house.

01:55.827 --> 01:58.310
Look, if you want
to discuss this...

01:59.448 --> 02:02.344
Okay. Glad to hear it.
Yes, I...

02:04.586 --> 02:06.724
Yeah, all right.
Take care.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.034
Bye.

02:08.137 --> 02:10.482
What?

02:10.586 --> 02:12.034
I thought you were coming later.

02:12.137 --> 02:14.413
Took an earlier flight.
Wanted to surprise you.

02:14.517 --> 02:16.241
Well, consider me surprised.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.275
- Mm, hi.
- Hey.

02:23.793 --> 02:24.689
Um...

02:24.793 --> 02:26.103
you think you can cut class?

02:26.206 --> 02:27.655
There's, um, something
I wanted to run by you.

02:27.758 --> 02:28.827
Oh.

02:29.896 --> 02:32.862
Yeah, I guess I could finish
at home. Is everything...?

02:32.965 --> 02:36.103
Relax, only good things, okay?
Everything is fine.

02:36.206 --> 02:39.448
Or it will be once I get
some sushi in me.

02:39.551 --> 02:42.034
That's the business.
Let's do it.

02:42.137 --> 02:44.379
- Hey, Kelly?
- Yeah?

02:44.482 --> 02:46.137
It's really good to see you.

02:46.241 --> 02:48.793
You, too.

02:48.896 --> 02:51.103
Now, food.

02:51.206 --> 02:53.379
All right.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.379
Oh, good morning, sleepyhead.

03:02.482 --> 03:03.965
Late start, huh?

03:04.068 --> 03:07.034
Sleeping in is one of
the few perks of being fired.

03:08.517 --> 03:10.137
But I do have plans
outside the house today.

03:10.241 --> 03:12.103
- Mm.
- So, what's up?

03:12.206 --> 03:13.517
I'm just worried about you.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.758
- Cass, I...
- I know, I know. You're fine.

03:16.862 --> 03:18.827
But that word doesn't
inspire confidence

03:18.931 --> 03:21.689
when it's typically used to say
the exact opposite.

03:21.793 --> 03:23.517
I am fine.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.206
Honestly, I'm-I'm fine.

03:25.310 --> 03:26.896
I'm just trying to
figure things out.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.931
Well, have you spoken to Kevin?
You know, about job stuff?

03:32.034 --> 03:33.724
Ah, I don't want to bother him
with that stuff.

03:33.827 --> 03:35.241
Especially since
he just helped me

03:35.344 --> 03:36.482
celebrate getting this one.

03:36.586 --> 03:38.931
Anyways, shouldn't you be
off to HQ?

03:39.034 --> 03:40.862
There's no point in both of us
getting fired.

03:40.965 --> 03:43.655
No. Just know that
I am here for you.

03:43.758 --> 03:45.448
We may no longer be coworkers,

03:45.551 --> 03:47.034
but we're still neighbors.

03:47.137 --> 03:49.379
And I'd like to think
pretty good friends.

03:49.482 --> 03:52.655
Yeah, definitely both
of those things.

03:53.896 --> 03:55.241
Friends.

04:03.448 --> 04:05.413
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:05.517 --> 04:06.827
Hey.

04:06.931 --> 04:09.482
So, uh, have we solved
Operation Trey yet?

04:09.586 --> 04:11.655
No, not-not-not quite.

04:11.758 --> 04:14.137
I'm-I'm gonna talk to James,

04:14.241 --> 04:16.896
but last time things got
a little heated, you know?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.137
So I'm just gonna give it
some space.

04:19.241 --> 04:21.000
Let cooler heads prevail.

04:21.103 --> 04:22.172
I guess that makes sense.

04:22.275 --> 04:23.379
Yeah, yeah.

04:25.586 --> 04:28.758
So, is there any chance
that there is...

04:28.862 --> 04:31.724
something else
you're not talking about?

04:33.068 --> 04:34.448
What do you mean?

04:38.344 --> 04:39.793
Hmm?

04:39.896 --> 04:41.965
You did your <i>Mr. Mrs. Smith</i>
thing with Julia,

04:42.068 --> 04:44.172
which-- thanks for reading me in
on that, by the way.

04:44.275 --> 04:47.758
- Cass.
- No, it's fine. I get it.

04:47.862 --> 04:49.241
Just felt like you'd bought in.

04:49.344 --> 04:51.931
But now Julia is
working in D.C.,

04:52.034 --> 04:54.275
so she hasn't been able
to look into it.

04:54.379 --> 04:55.517
And you haven't either,

04:55.620 --> 04:58.068
and yet you're here fixating.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.965
It's hard to shake off.

05:00.068 --> 05:03.103
I mean, someone
targeting m-my unit.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.379
It's a big buy, right?

05:04.482 --> 05:05.586
And it doesn't
exactly fit the M.O.

05:05.689 --> 05:06.758
of an anarchist organization.

05:06.862 --> 05:08.827
Grey Flag didn't come after me

05:08.931 --> 05:10.482
until after I investigated Fenton.

05:10.586 --> 05:12.862
But these deaths happened
before any of that.

05:12.965 --> 05:14.827
Yes.

05:14.931 --> 05:17.275
And yet you're still
thinking about what Tommy said.

05:17.379 --> 05:21.310
When he said it, I guess I was
just hoping for an easy answer.

05:21.413 --> 05:25.827
But now the adrenaline has
worn off and I'm not so sure.

05:25.931 --> 05:28.689
- You think he's crazy?
- I don't know.

05:28.793 --> 05:31.724
Part of me thinks that Tommy's
probably been going downhill

05:31.827 --> 05:33.586
for a while,
and then these deaths,

05:33.689 --> 05:35.724
and then I'm on the news
getting kidnapped and...

05:35.827 --> 05:38.413
The story made sense to him,
but it doesn't to you.

05:39.379 --> 05:40.482
No.

05:40.586 --> 05:42.068
Okay, look,

05:42.172 --> 05:44.206
you have the intel
right in front of you.

05:44.310 --> 05:48.103
So if you are so sure that Tommy
is wrong and that you're right,

05:48.206 --> 05:49.793
there's no harm in proving that.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.206
That would also mean that
there's no one out there

05:52.310 --> 05:53.827
with a vendetta against you.

05:54.758 --> 05:58.586
So why don't we prove
Tommy wrong once and for all?

05:58.689 --> 06:00.931
Get you some closure.

06:12.724 --> 06:14.000
Thanks so much. All right.

06:14.103 --> 06:15.586
Hell of a shot on 17, man.

06:15.689 --> 06:17.482
I knew I liked you. I'll get it.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.517
Man, it's been a minute,
but, hey,

06:20.620 --> 06:22.137
I'm glad to know
that I still got it.

06:22.241 --> 06:24.655
Yeah.
You know, I've always admired

06:24.758 --> 06:26.310
the time you put in
down there at the V.A.

06:26.413 --> 06:28.206
It's been really nice
getting to know you better

06:28.310 --> 06:29.413
through all that.

06:29.517 --> 06:30.827
Yeah, likewise, man.

06:30.931 --> 06:31.724
I mean, it's important
for us to give back

06:31.827 --> 06:33.068
and uplift our community.

06:33.172 --> 06:34.413
Couldn't agree more.

06:34.517 --> 06:36.275
Now, that Ranger job

06:36.379 --> 06:38.172
has a lot of red tape involved,

06:38.275 --> 06:40.758
and some of that keeps you
from doing real work.

06:40.862 --> 06:42.586
The fact that they let you go

06:42.689 --> 06:44.931
over some small infractions?
Ridiculous.

06:45.034 --> 06:47.620
Yeah, it's, it's okay.
I'm doing okay with it.

06:47.724 --> 06:49.344
I'm just figuring out
what's next.

06:49.448 --> 06:50.931
And I'd love to help you
with that.

06:51.034 --> 06:54.344
On my side of things
there is no red tape.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.068
What matters is results.

06:57.172 --> 06:58.586
Not everybody can apply

06:58.689 --> 07:00.344
what we learn on deployment
back home like you.

07:00.448 --> 07:02.586
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

07:02.689 --> 07:03.793
So, look,

07:03.896 --> 07:06.482
the lobbying group I work with--

07:06.586 --> 07:08.758
we're in the market
for a consultant.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.896
Some security stuff, but
it's hardly a rent-a-cop gig.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.931
I'm talking brushing shoulders
with celebrities

07:14.034 --> 07:17.310
and senators alike
all for veterans' causes.

07:18.793 --> 07:21.344
I'm-I'm flattered, Andrew.
Really, I am.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.758
But, you know, I've been going
nonstop for years now

07:24.862 --> 07:27.482
and I'm just enjoying taking
this beat for myself

07:27.586 --> 07:29.448
right now, so...

07:31.034 --> 07:33.034
I'm hoping
we can change your mind.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.758
All right, what exactly
are we talking?

07:37.862 --> 07:40.275
We lobby for veteran support.

07:40.379 --> 07:43.206
Too many of our guys and gals
go put it all on the line

07:43.310 --> 07:44.689
to come back to nothing.

07:44.793 --> 07:47.241
It's unacceptable.

07:47.344 --> 07:48.620
You've got my attention.

07:48.724 --> 07:52.620
And things aren't always
as they seem in D.C.

07:52.724 --> 07:55.034
Things can get hairy.

07:56.172 --> 07:58.862
- So, is this the gig?
- Sort of.

07:59.862 --> 08:01.517
I'm ready to get you signing
on the dotted line.

08:01.620 --> 08:03.241
But with everything going on,

08:03.344 --> 08:05.068
not everybody shares
the same enthusiasm

08:05.172 --> 08:07.551
after what happened
with your Ranger gig.

08:08.413 --> 08:10.344
Just look at this as insurance.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.034
An entrance exam, even.

08:12.137 --> 08:15.344
Just think about it.
Look that over.

08:15.448 --> 08:17.689
It's plans for an upcoming gala.

08:17.793 --> 08:19.965
In all of it,
something doesn't add up.

08:20.758 --> 08:23.000
You figure it out,
you give me a call.

08:24.862 --> 08:26.655
All right. Will do.

08:26.758 --> 08:28.137
Thanks, Andrew.

08:28.931 --> 08:30.551
- Enjoy.
- Bon appétit.

08:30.655 --> 08:33.517
- Merci.
- Yeah.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.896
So, Charlie and Bravo?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.172
Uh, Sam Turner and Robert Ortiz.

08:38.275 --> 08:39.862
Right.

08:39.965 --> 08:42.034
Both died within months of
each other in different states.

08:42.137 --> 08:45.310
You know, I feel like
I'm-I'm reading tea leaves.

08:45.413 --> 08:48.689
You know, like, grasping for
a connection that isn't there.

08:48.793 --> 08:50.413
Uh, hi.
Queen of the tea leaves here.

08:50.517 --> 08:53.172
- Okay, well, that's different.
- Well, not really.

08:53.275 --> 08:56.517
When Miles disappeared,
everybody thought I was insane,

08:56.620 --> 08:58.344
but eventually it paid off.

08:58.448 --> 08:59.689
Yeah.

08:59.793 --> 09:01.310
But there's something else.

09:04.034 --> 09:06.137
Digging into the past like this,

09:06.241 --> 09:07.827
these connections
between my unit--

09:07.931 --> 09:11.206
it-it just, you know,
leads to a lot of pain.

09:11.310 --> 09:15.655
But sometimes it leads to
answers you desperately need.

09:17.068 --> 09:18.206
Yeah.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.
All right, let's do it, um...

09:20.103 --> 09:22.620
Sam Turner.

09:22.724 --> 09:26.931
Car accident six months ago,
died in Lincoln, Nebraska.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.862
- Yeah.
- Apparently,

09:28.965 --> 09:31.379
the witness said that
there were two vehicles

09:31.482 --> 09:33.103
with three people.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.103
Turner was in one,
two guys in the other.

09:36.206 --> 09:38.310
But one of them walked away
from the scene.

09:38.413 --> 09:39.827
Okay, hold on, hold on.

09:39.931 --> 09:42.310
Okay, the other witness
and the officers report

09:42.413 --> 09:43.448
two people on the scene.

09:43.551 --> 09:44.896
Both deceased.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.862
Uh, no mention of a third person
who survived.

09:47.965 --> 09:50.620
Weird, but we get conflicting
statements all the time.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.620
Right.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.413
Uh, okay, apparently,

09:53.517 --> 09:55.586
Turner was driving
ahead of the other vehicle

09:55.689 --> 09:58.862
when the witness heard the
second car blaring his horn,

09:58.965 --> 10:01.344
which spooked Turner...

10:01.448 --> 10:02.448
What?

10:02.551 --> 10:05.206
No, that, that can't be right.

10:05.310 --> 10:08.620
- Why?
- It doesn't make sense.

10:09.827 --> 10:12.310
Come on, you can't be serious.

10:12.413 --> 10:15.034
I'm just saying, the only thing
bigger in Texas is the hype.

10:16.448 --> 10:18.793
We've got enemy engagement
on route Indy.

10:18.896 --> 10:21.379
Hey, let's stay frosty, gentlemen.

10:22.517 --> 10:24.206
<i>I know Tommy's got
to have an opinion</i>

10:24.310 --> 10:25.344
on this one.

10:25.448 --> 10:26.931
- I ain't touching that.
- Typical.

10:27.034 --> 10:29.206
Yeah, your little orange
and white striped burgers...

10:38.000 --> 10:38.931
Looks like you've seen a ghost.

10:39.034 --> 10:41.379
Good to see you're okay, Turner.

10:41.482 --> 10:42.724
Thought we'd lost you.

10:42.827 --> 10:44.551
- So, what'd they say?
- Huh?

10:44.655 --> 10:45.689
What did the doc say?!

10:45.793 --> 10:48.206
Damn ears are still ringing.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.137
Hearing's shot.

10:51.241 --> 10:53.034
Doc says there's good news
and bad news.

10:53.137 --> 10:54.413
Bad news is that

10:54.517 --> 10:56.068
whatever hearing damage
I have now is permanent.

10:56.172 --> 10:57.448
It's just gonna keep
getting worse

10:57.551 --> 10:58.724
until it's gone completely.

10:58.827 --> 11:00.517
The hell is the good news then?

11:01.793 --> 11:03.931
20 years time...

11:04.034 --> 11:05.758
it'll be crickets,

11:05.862 --> 11:08.000
and I won't have to listen
to a damn thing

11:08.103 --> 11:09.137
any of you have to say again.

11:09.241 --> 11:12.068
I'll finally be at peace.

11:15.896 --> 11:18.172
<i>Uh, Walker, care to share
with the class?</i>

11:19.068 --> 11:20.655
Uh, yeah.

11:20.758 --> 11:23.896
Uh, the report says that Turner
swerved after hearing the guy

11:24.000 --> 11:25.275
blaring his horn,
but he wouldn't have.

11:25.379 --> 11:27.241
Or maybe couldn't have.

11:27.344 --> 11:28.275
And why not?

11:28.379 --> 11:29.586
Turner was deaf.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.206
At the very least,
headed that way fast.

11:32.310 --> 11:35.931
Uh, just saying,
it doesn't add up, you know?

11:36.034 --> 11:38.103
But, you know,
reports have inconsistencies,

11:38.206 --> 11:40.448
and witnesses aren't
always reliable...

11:40.551 --> 11:44.103
And sometimes an accident isn't
really an accident at all.

11:45.275 --> 11:46.413
No.

11:46.517 --> 11:48.896
So one of these two deaths
feels sus.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
And then Robert Ortiz,
a heart attack.

11:52.103 --> 11:54.137
I mean, heart attack is-is

11:54.241 --> 11:55.793
one of the leading
causes of death every year.

11:55.896 --> 11:56.827
- Right?
- Right.

11:56.931 --> 11:59.137
Well, we may not have access

11:59.241 --> 12:02.655
to his full medical history...

12:02.758 --> 12:05.206
but his widow moved back here

12:05.310 --> 12:08.448
after he passed
to be closer to her family.

12:09.482 --> 12:10.413
Laura.

12:10.517 --> 12:12.068
Uh, yeah.

12:12.172 --> 12:13.758
- Laura Ortiz.
- Yeah.

12:16.241 --> 12:17.310
Cass,

12:17.413 --> 12:20.344
if Tommy is wrong,

12:20.448 --> 12:24.344
then we would just be
stirring up her grief

12:24.448 --> 12:25.655
for no reason.

12:25.758 --> 12:28.620
And again, I raise you.

12:28.724 --> 12:30.206
If Tommy was right,

12:30.310 --> 12:34.206
then there is someone
hunting down your old unit.

12:35.758 --> 12:38.103
And there are only
two of you left.

12:46.413 --> 12:49.206
- I saw that.
- It was fair game.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.241
- Eh...
- Mm.

12:50.344 --> 12:51.896
If you say so.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.517
So-- thank you.

12:54.620 --> 12:56.000
Earlier...

12:56.103 --> 12:58.103
Yes, oh, yes, earlier,

12:58.206 --> 12:59.965
- you said you had
something to tell me.
- Mm-hmm.

13:00.068 --> 13:02.689
A good thing,
not a worrying thing.

13:02.793 --> 13:04.827
Not that I'm worried at all.

13:04.931 --> 13:06.931
I got a call the other day

13:07.034 --> 13:08.965
from our agency's
emerging talent division.

13:09.068 --> 13:11.206
They had
a very interesting offer.

13:11.310 --> 13:12.517
Yeah?

13:12.620 --> 13:14.379
They've asked me to head
a satellite venture

13:14.482 --> 13:15.827
they're starting.

13:15.931 --> 13:18.344
I would be scouting
and tracking upcoming talent

13:18.448 --> 13:20.724
at the collegiate
or even high school level.

13:20.827 --> 13:22.172
- Kelly...
- I know.

13:22.275 --> 13:23.448
...let's go.

13:23.551 --> 13:25.275
That is huge.
When would it start?

13:25.379 --> 13:27.482
- Where would it be?
What's the deal?
- Soon.

13:27.586 --> 13:31.758
Yeah, and...
I would be based out of Austin.

13:31.862 --> 13:33.448
Full-time.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.482
No more living out of suitcases,

13:35.586 --> 13:38.517
no more stolen weekends.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.137
I'd be coming home.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.310
- You'd be coming home.
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.413 --> 13:48.344
What do you...?

13:50.034 --> 13:51.862
What do you want to do?

13:52.827 --> 13:55.103
I know what I want to do.

13:55.206 --> 13:57.862
It's what you want to do
that I'm interested in.

14:02.103 --> 14:03.758
No, no, look, I'm sorry.

14:03.862 --> 14:05.137
It's just,
it's a lot to process.

14:05.241 --> 14:07.103
Um, you know,
things at work are, like...

14:08.655 --> 14:10.172
Not that it's about that.
I'm not making it about that.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.068
-'Cause it's not about that.
- Okay.

14:12.172 --> 14:14.068
It's just, this is a lot
to take in, you know?

14:14.172 --> 14:16.241
Look, you don't have
to decide right now.

14:16.344 --> 14:18.517
I know I just
sprung this on you.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.655
So think it over,

14:20.758 --> 14:24.310
and whatever happens next is
up to both of us.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.172
Okay?

14:28.620 --> 14:29.655
That was totally fair game.

14:33.413 --> 14:36.448
One last thing to knock off
our endless list.

14:36.551 --> 14:37.689
And I have another one.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.275
I told them
what we were going for,

14:39.379 --> 14:41.241
and this is what
they came back with.

14:41.344 --> 14:42.827
Mm. Oh, wow.

14:42.931 --> 14:45.448
You know what? That's actually
better than I imagined.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.862
I know, right?

14:46.965 --> 14:49.000
And we can give them
some feedback

14:49.103 --> 14:50.517
if something isn't
feeling right.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.896
Hey, thank you for
running point on this.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.965
- Partner.
- No, I had fun.

14:56.068 --> 14:57.000
But seriously,
let's do this photo shoot.

14:57.103 --> 14:58.379
Let's do it.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.931
This is gonna look so cute.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.000
I didn't know
y'all were out here.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.275
Yeah, we're taking pictures
for the website.

15:09.172 --> 15:10.655
Oh, um,

15:10.758 --> 15:13.586
that's a doodle a marketing guy
turned into a logo.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.241
This one not shiny
enough for you?

15:18.448 --> 15:20.517
Well, we just thought
that we could, you know...

15:20.620 --> 15:22.655
Yeah, I'll see you back
at the house, Abby.

15:26.068 --> 15:27.620
So he's still mad?

15:27.724 --> 15:30.344
Well, "mad" is putting it
a little simply, honey.

15:30.448 --> 15:31.586
But, um...

15:31.689 --> 15:35.034
Uh, he's still something.
I'll get into it.

15:39.448 --> 15:41.310
Let's do this.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.068
It looks great.

15:47.206 --> 15:50.137
Got to admit, Cordell.
This is quite a surprise.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.620
Yeah. Yeah, no, I-I know,

15:52.724 --> 15:54.655
um, it's been a long time.

15:54.758 --> 15:55.965
Since the medal ceremony?

15:56.068 --> 15:57.551
Yeah.

15:57.655 --> 16:01.448
Never seen so many
solemn faces getting rewarded.

16:02.413 --> 16:05.000
But what happened
to you boys after...

16:06.379 --> 16:08.896
Well.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.206
So, what can I help you with?

16:11.310 --> 16:13.896
- Is this Ranger business or...
- No, no. No, no, no.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.482
Strictly personal.

16:15.586 --> 16:17.206
Um...

16:18.344 --> 16:21.172
I-I'm really sorry
that we fell out of touch.

16:21.275 --> 16:23.724
I heard about Rob,

16:23.827 --> 16:27.000
and I wanted to see you.

16:27.103 --> 16:30.103
Express my condolences and...

16:31.862 --> 16:34.586
...just see what I missed.

16:37.482 --> 16:40.137
That last year he got a new job.

16:40.241 --> 16:41.758
We had another kid on the way,

16:41.862 --> 16:44.931
and Rob just wanted to bring in
some more money.

16:45.034 --> 16:46.137
We were good.

16:46.241 --> 16:47.724
Had a lovely church community

16:47.827 --> 16:51.206
and he'd even gotten rid of
his only vice-- Coffee.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.965
We were doing so well.

16:55.068 --> 16:58.655
But then his PTSD was set off.

17:00.655 --> 17:03.827
Uh, what triggered it?

17:03.931 --> 17:06.206
He couldn't sleep.

17:07.206 --> 17:09.172
And when he did, nightmares.

17:09.275 --> 17:11.827
He started changing,

17:11.931 --> 17:13.517
drinking,

17:13.620 --> 17:15.448
doing drugs
with his new coworkers.

17:15.551 --> 17:17.862
Rob was straitlaced since birth.

17:17.965 --> 17:20.275
And then he was different.

17:21.310 --> 17:23.689
Not the man I had known
for 20 years.

17:24.758 --> 17:28.068
That day,
he left the house in a tizzy.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.172
Hours later,
I get the phone call.

17:30.275 --> 17:31.482
Heart attack.

17:31.586 --> 17:33.931
Had something
to do with the drugs.

17:34.034 --> 17:36.172
He was so young and healthy.

17:36.275 --> 17:38.344
I'm so sorry.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.965
All right.
Y'all know the drill.

17:41.068 --> 17:43.379
We're gonna be doing
a tactical sight exploration.

17:43.482 --> 17:45.689
Gonna be heading out
at 0400 hours.

17:45.793 --> 17:48.827
Now, I got complete faith
in every one of y'all

17:48.931 --> 17:50.172
to see this thing through.

17:50.275 --> 17:52.172
- Hoorah?
- Hoorah.

17:52.275 --> 17:54.413
- Hoorah!
- Hoorah!

17:54.517 --> 17:56.655
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

18:02.310 --> 18:04.206
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Walker.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.413
- Need your help.
- Yes!

18:05.517 --> 18:06.758
Of course, Sergeant.

18:06.862 --> 18:09.551
What the hell
is your deal, Ortiz?

18:09.655 --> 18:11.275
Just trying to keep the team up.

18:11.379 --> 18:13.482
Well, you ain't a damn
cheerleader, are you?

18:14.344 --> 18:16.103
Where are they?

18:19.758 --> 18:21.586
- I want to be
ready for anything.
- The only thing you're about

18:21.689 --> 18:24.310
to be ready for with this
is a casket.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.482
You don't get this
under control,

18:26.586 --> 18:28.206
and I will run it up
the chain of command.

18:28.310 --> 18:30.862
Those boys will have you home
with a dishonorable discharge

18:30.965 --> 18:32.344
faster than you can blink.

18:33.172 --> 18:34.586
Is that clear?

18:34.689 --> 18:35.793
Yes, Sergeant.

18:38.931 --> 18:40.965
Hey.

18:41.068 --> 18:44.206
- What's going on, man?
- I'm-I'm trying, man.

18:44.310 --> 18:46.724
I just don't know
how to get through all this.

18:47.655 --> 18:49.689
- Do you trust me?
- With my life.

18:49.793 --> 18:52.586
Then believe me when I say
you've got this.

18:52.689 --> 18:54.931
All right?
And we've got you.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.068
No one does this alone.

18:59.310 --> 19:01.655
All right?

19:03.241 --> 19:06.275
Is there something
that I should know?

19:07.310 --> 19:09.793
Uh? No, no. Um...

19:09.896 --> 19:13.965
Rob was a good man.
He is a great man.

19:14.068 --> 19:15.896
The best of us.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.137
We all did what we had to do
to survive over there.

19:20.241 --> 19:23.310
And we all had vices.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.655
You know? I did.

19:26.758 --> 19:28.793
Rob did, and...

19:28.896 --> 19:30.965
I saw him

19:31.068 --> 19:33.482
start to change,

19:33.586 --> 19:34.689
and...

19:36.517 --> 19:39.896
And then-and then he worked
so hard to get better,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.448
and to spare you that struggle.

19:41.551 --> 19:43.655
You come in here
after all this time?

19:43.758 --> 19:46.827
You know,
whatever issues Robert had,

19:46.931 --> 19:49.344
they all stem from his time
in that hellhole.

19:49.448 --> 19:50.862
If it weren't, why would some

19:50.965 --> 19:53.448
military contractor work
suddenly set him off?

19:53.551 --> 19:55.758
I'm sorry,
did you say contractor?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.931
Do you have a-a name?

19:59.034 --> 20:00.931
I think it's time you leave.

20:02.172 --> 20:03.758
- I'm sorry?
- Leave.

20:03.862 --> 20:05.000
Please.

20:05.103 --> 20:06.206
Uh, of course.

20:06.310 --> 20:07.931
Um...

20:25.068 --> 20:27.655
I knew this was a bad idea.

20:27.758 --> 20:29.689
All we did
was drudge up the past

20:29.793 --> 20:31.517
and bring all that grief
back to her.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.310
And I feel terrible about it,

20:33.413 --> 20:35.655
- but if Ortiz was set up...
- No, no, no, stop, stop.

20:35.758 --> 20:37.137
Stop, please.

20:38.344 --> 20:42.172
You know, what happened to us
over there-- that was ugly.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.965
And then
the guilt that came after--

20:45.068 --> 20:47.724
the regret--
that was... that was ugly, too.

20:47.827 --> 20:49.448
And you come home

20:49.551 --> 20:51.758
and you're rewarded
for surviving

20:51.862 --> 20:53.137
when your brother didn't.

20:56.310 --> 20:57.827
Dealing with that...

20:59.000 --> 21:00.862
...that time in my life...

21:05.620 --> 21:08.517
I try to avoid it, uh,
because it hurts, you know?

21:08.620 --> 21:09.965
And now,

21:10.068 --> 21:12.620
finding this out about them...

21:12.724 --> 21:15.620
I just need a sec.
Can you just give me sec?

21:15.724 --> 21:18.413
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

21:28.137 --> 21:29.620
Come on, man.

21:29.724 --> 21:30.827
What is it?

21:30.931 --> 21:32.137
Is Walker--
I texted him earlier

21:32.241 --> 21:33.689
- and he's leaving me hanging.
- Oh.

21:34.689 --> 21:37.034
We're in one of those phases
where the line between

21:37.137 --> 21:39.931
former partner and current boss
is getting a little fuzzy.

21:40.034 --> 21:41.379
Y'all have been
driving each other nuts

21:41.482 --> 21:42.586
since you were
at the same level.

21:42.689 --> 21:45.137
It's what family does.

21:45.241 --> 21:47.000
You should talk to him about it.

21:47.103 --> 21:49.655
- I really think
he would hear it.
- You think so?

21:49.758 --> 21:52.551
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, right after Carolina
wins the Super Bowl?

21:52.655 --> 21:55.344
Was that an up-to-date
football reference, Captain?

21:55.448 --> 21:58.793
- I can hang, baby.
- Okay. Mm-hmm.

21:58.896 --> 22:02.275
Maybe also want to talk to me
about what happened with Trey?

22:02.379 --> 22:04.103
- It's-it's nothing to...
- Larry...

22:04.206 --> 22:06.172
I am pretty observant.

22:06.275 --> 22:09.413
I may have also been
on the receiving end of a few

22:09.517 --> 22:11.758
- fiery Cordi texts. Just...
- Look, we just...

22:11.862 --> 22:13.482
we-we reached a boiling point.

22:13.586 --> 22:14.827
- DPS got involved...
- O-Okay.

22:14.931 --> 22:17.172
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

22:17.275 --> 22:18.724
I know that if you fired Trey--

22:18.827 --> 22:21.620
the man that saved your life
and gave us this chance--

22:21.724 --> 22:23.172
it was for good reason.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.724
Okay?
I trust you.

22:25.827 --> 22:27.172
Wow.

22:27.275 --> 22:28.655
You...

22:29.586 --> 22:33.000
That trust means a lot.

22:34.206 --> 22:35.482
Walker and Perez
have been up in arms.

22:35.586 --> 22:37.137
And everyone, really,
it's like...

22:37.241 --> 22:38.517
Hey.

22:38.620 --> 22:40.137
I am not everyone.

22:40.241 --> 22:42.000
No, you are not.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.724
Kel, I don't know...

22:49.758 --> 22:53.000
I don't know
if I'm still good at this.

22:53.103 --> 22:56.068
- You know?
- We are doing this right now.

22:56.172 --> 22:57.344
No, but you know what I mean.

22:57.448 --> 22:58.896
Like, the obsession,
the worrying,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.137
the not letting you in...

23:00.241 --> 23:01.482
It's not...

23:02.482 --> 23:05.000
You have changed more than
you give yourself credit for.

23:05.103 --> 23:07.206
I don't need
your Ranger schedule

23:07.310 --> 23:09.482
or a blow-by-blow of your day.

23:09.586 --> 23:13.206
It's about this.
Us. Together.

23:13.310 --> 23:16.448
The both of us just sitting here
doing our own things?

23:16.551 --> 23:18.620
It's perfect.

23:19.413 --> 23:20.896
Okay?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Okay.

23:23.103 --> 23:24.758
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.827
You're gonna tell me

23:30.931 --> 23:33.137
that I should go talk to them,
and all I got to say to that

23:33.241 --> 23:35.034
is maybe they should have
thought about coming

23:35.137 --> 23:36.655
to talk to me.

23:37.862 --> 23:39.517
Well, I'd love to actually
have the conversation

23:39.620 --> 23:41.068
I came in here to have with you,

23:41.172 --> 23:44.551
but I'd feel a little bit better
if you took a breath.

23:44.655 --> 23:46.517
And put the cleaver down.

23:56.896 --> 24:00.068
I just don't want you
to have any regrets.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.689
Everybody's got some.

24:01.793 --> 24:03.103
But not like this.

24:03.206 --> 24:05.379
You know, we just
have gone through it lately,

24:05.482 --> 24:07.068
after my...

24:08.137 --> 24:09.862
I mean, I sh...

24:09.965 --> 24:11.482
I shouldn't have waited so long

24:11.586 --> 24:13.379
to try to patch things up
with my brother.

24:13.482 --> 24:15.482
This ain't anything like that.

24:15.586 --> 24:17.103
Oh, really?

24:17.206 --> 24:19.448
Nothing about a misunderstanding

24:19.551 --> 24:21.275
driving two people apart
for so long

24:21.379 --> 24:23.137
that they lose track of
what they were fighting about

24:23.241 --> 24:24.379
in the first place?

24:24.482 --> 24:26.034
I haven't lost track
of anything,

24:26.137 --> 24:27.586
not this time.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.620
Bon, I see that you are
going through something.

24:31.724 --> 24:33.137
- I do.
- Abeline, I ju...

24:33.241 --> 24:36.482
And you know you hold things
close to your chest

24:36.586 --> 24:37.862
for far too long.

24:37.965 --> 24:39.620
And you're right.

24:39.724 --> 24:45.000
I-I came in here to say
that I agree with you,

24:45.103 --> 24:46.793
I've got your back...

24:48.068 --> 24:49.448
...and I get it.

24:49.551 --> 24:51.586
I'm on your side.

24:51.689 --> 24:55.000
But also, I think you...
you do need to talk to them.

24:56.896 --> 25:00.482
Of course they should have
tried to talk to you first,

25:00.586 --> 25:03.000
but I think this
is one of those moments where

25:03.103 --> 25:05.896
we still need to do
the teaching.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.655
Lead by example.

25:07.758 --> 25:10.965
And bask in your superiority.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.172
I see it.

25:31.517 --> 25:32.896
<i>Andrew Hyde's office.</i>

25:33.000 --> 25:34.275
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

25:34.379 --> 25:35.310
Hi, this is Trey Barnett.

25:35.413 --> 25:36.689
<i>Mr. Barnett.</i>

25:36.793 --> 25:39.241
<i>I was told to expect
a call from you.</i>

25:39.344 --> 25:41.034
Yeah, is Andrew around?

25:41.137 --> 25:42.965
I solved the puzzle.

25:43.068 --> 25:44.586
The... test.

25:45.448 --> 25:46.517
Whatever.

25:46.620 --> 25:48.034
<i>Andrew is out of office,</i>

25:48.137 --> 25:50.034
<i>but I'm happy
to consider your results.</i>

25:50.137 --> 25:51.448
Okay.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.034
All right. So, Andrew
had me looking over, uh

25:54.137 --> 25:56.379
an event at the
Crosby Amphitheater in Cinci.

25:56.482 --> 25:58.034
<i>And what did you find?</i>

25:58.137 --> 26:00.862
Okay, so, the Crosby
was connected

26:00.965 --> 26:03.758
by a tunnel
to an old financial center.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.448
It was closed off in the '90s,

26:05.551 --> 26:08.034
but the buildings are
still connected to each other

26:08.137 --> 26:09.931
and they share
a backup generator.

26:10.034 --> 26:11.724
We would need to
account for that

26:11.827 --> 26:14.137
and clear
the surrounding facilities.

26:17.965 --> 26:19.689
<i>Someone will be in touch shortly</i>

26:19.793 --> 26:22.241
<i>to get you started on the next
steps of the hiring process.</i>

26:22.344 --> 26:24.862
<i>I'm sure Andrew will personally
reach out when he returns.</i>

26:24.965 --> 26:27.551
- Just like that?
<i>- Just like that.</i>

26:27.655 --> 26:29.758
<i>- Talk soon.</i>
- Thank you.

26:31.379 --> 26:32.931
Yeah!

26:33.758 --> 26:35.758
Cass, listen,
about earlier, back...

26:35.862 --> 26:36.965
You don't have to...

26:37.068 --> 26:38.379
I-I know, I know.
But I want to.

26:38.482 --> 26:39.862
Um...

26:39.965 --> 26:42.655
Seeing Laura,
everything came flooding back,

26:42.758 --> 26:44.620
and-and kind of had me spinning.

26:44.724 --> 26:45.793
I'm sorry.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.379
But I-I know I need to focus.

26:47.482 --> 26:48.655
And I am, um,

26:48.758 --> 26:51.275
ready to focus.

26:51.379 --> 26:52.482
So, we're doing this?

26:52.586 --> 26:54.206
- We're doing this.
- Okay.

26:54.310 --> 26:58.551
So she mentioned that
Rob had taken a contractor gig.

26:58.655 --> 27:00.206
Which feels like

27:00.310 --> 27:02.620
he could have been working
for Grey Flag when he died.

27:02.724 --> 27:04.689
Yeah, could have,
but we can't be sure.

27:04.793 --> 27:07.068
But Turner's accident reports

27:07.172 --> 27:09.862
and Ortiz's timely relapse...

27:09.965 --> 27:12.310
- The math ain't mathin'.
- No.

27:12.413 --> 27:13.931
Did Tommy say anything else?

27:14.034 --> 27:17.068
No, uh, he-he didn't
have a chance to.

27:17.172 --> 27:19.068
We were all kind of
stunned in the moment.

27:19.172 --> 27:20.379
So, what do you want to do?

27:20.482 --> 27:22.724
I'm gonna stop wasting time.

27:22.827 --> 27:24.172
What does that mean?

27:24.275 --> 27:26.586
It means that if Tommy
was right about that,

27:26.689 --> 27:28.517
he could be right
about everything.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.310
<i>we're sorry, the number
you are trying to reach</i>

27:32.413 --> 27:34.551
<i>is not in service at this time.</i>

27:34.655 --> 27:37.896
Okay, well, you did say that
the dude lives off the grid.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.379
So, maybe he's just
recycling burner phones.

27:40.482 --> 27:43.862
Or maybe something
is keeping him offline.

28:04.206 --> 28:07.172
Thought you said this guy
had crazy security.

28:07.275 --> 28:09.793
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't he be...

28:21.137 --> 28:22.758
Damn it.

28:38.965 --> 28:41.068
Oh, this doesn't look good.

28:41.172 --> 28:42.793
Yeah.

28:48.517 --> 28:49.862
Tommy!

28:49.965 --> 28:51.689
Tommy. No, no, no, no, no.

28:51.793 --> 28:53.137
Hey, hey, hey.

28:56.172 --> 28:58.689
Another one bites the dust.

28:58.793 --> 29:00.275
No, no.

29:00.379 --> 29:01.689
Hey, stay with me. Stay.

29:01.793 --> 29:03.448
- Stay with me.
- You c...

29:03.551 --> 29:06.137
- you came back.
- Yeah, I came back.

29:06.241 --> 29:08.103
- You're here.
- I'm here, yeah, I'm here.

29:08.206 --> 29:10.241
You were right, okay?
You were right.

29:10.344 --> 29:11.586
I should have listened to you.

29:11.689 --> 29:13.655
There's no cell service.

29:13.758 --> 29:15.931
Hey, hang in there, okay?

29:16.620 --> 29:18.310
No.

29:18.413 --> 29:21.137
No use.
This is it for me.

29:23.517 --> 29:24.965
Walker, whoever did this
was just here.

29:25.068 --> 29:26.758
They've got to be close.

29:28.724 --> 29:30.758
Go, go, go.

29:31.551 --> 29:34.482
I'm here, brother.
I'm right here, okay?

32:20.827 --> 32:22.862
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too. Um...

32:22.965 --> 32:24.448
so, what happened here?
You okay?

32:24.551 --> 32:28.793
Yeah, I, uh... He was trying
to run me off the road.

32:28.896 --> 32:30.034
But, uh,

32:30.137 --> 32:32.310

32:35.517 --> 32:37.241
Do you recognize him at all?

32:37.344 --> 32:40.172
No, no.
I've never seen him in my life.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.724
Everyone I saw in captivity
got scooped up.

32:42.827 --> 32:45.551
That is not the answer

32:45.655 --> 32:47.896
I was hoping for.

32:59.862 --> 33:01.103
Hey.

33:01.206 --> 33:02.586
Thought it was hot tub time.

Okay? Whatever.

33:26.931 --> 33:28.310
Yes.

33:29.896 --> 33:31.896
Look, we're...

33:32.000 --> 33:33.379
We're finally at a point
in our lives

33:33.482 --> 33:35.758
where we can

33:35.862 --> 33:36.862

- Mm-hmm.

33:36.965 --> 33:37.896
We're set in our careers,

33:38.000 --> 33:38.896
our son is grown...

33:39.000 --> 33:40.275
Mm, thinks he's grown.

33:40.379 --> 33:42.586
Okay, he's technically grown.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.206
Okay.

33:45.172 --> 33:48.068
You moving back to Austin.

33:49.034 --> 33:51.379
There's no way
I'm passing that up.

33:52.206 --> 33:53.379
Baby, I'm ready...

33:53.482 --> 33:57.448
I'm ready for this,
for us, for...

33:57.551 --> 33:58.655
everything.

33:58.758 --> 34:00.241

34:12.448 --> 34:14.724
Maybe we can find
a place that's ours.

34:14.827 --> 34:18.068
Not that your quarter-life
crisis rental isn't

34:18.172 --> 34:20.172
kind of impressive, but...

34:20.275 --> 34:22.068
I think I'd be okay with that.

34:22.172 --> 34:24.000
DJ wants a room anyway.

34:24.103 --> 34:27.344
- Mm.
- And he's hoping for a place
with a proper pool.

34:27.448 --> 34:29.068
- Oh, DJ's got pool money now?
- That's what he said.

34:29.172 --> 34:30.068
- Is that-is that how it is?
- I...

34:30.172 --> 34:31.793
I'm just the messenger.

34:49.827 --> 34:52.482
When you boys were little,

34:52.586 --> 34:55.034
I used to think about
y'all taking over.

34:55.137 --> 34:57.896
It took a while, but...

34:58.758 --> 35:02.206
...I did come to accept that
you and Cordell, you just...

35:02.310 --> 35:04.586
you just didn't have
that-that green thumb,

35:04.689 --> 35:06.206
so to speak.

35:06.310 --> 35:07.551
And if I was to be the last

35:07.655 --> 35:10.551
generation
of true Walker ranchers,

35:10.655 --> 35:13.000
then to hell with it, so be it.

35:13.103 --> 35:16.137
All I cared about was that
my sons were... were happy.

35:16.241 --> 35:18.931
And we appreciated that.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.379
So much.

35:20.482 --> 35:23.758
But then my son, who won

35:23.862 --> 35:25.758
the school-wide spelling bee
in the second grade

35:25.862 --> 35:28.275
and knew what a tort was
that very same year,

35:28.379 --> 35:30.758
suddenly found an interest.

35:31.931 --> 35:34.310
Started to think about
this place less as Walker Ranch

35:34.413 --> 35:36.586
and more like
Walker and Sons ranch.

35:36.689 --> 35:38.862
Daddy...

35:38.965 --> 35:40.137
But then you...

35:42.482 --> 35:44.344
You went and you did all this.

35:45.620 --> 35:47.103
On your own.

35:47.206 --> 35:50.793
And I still don't know how
it's all gonna shake out, but...

35:50.896 --> 35:54.482
I'm man enough to admit...

35:56.034 --> 35:57.413
...that it hurt.

35:58.379 --> 36:02.965
Wiped away a vision that,
that I'd become so fond of.

36:03.068 --> 36:04.862
Dad, I...

36:06.344 --> 36:09.379
Dad, I was never
my intention to hurt you.

36:09.482 --> 36:12.034
I mean, I was trying
to leave my mark

36:12.137 --> 36:13.689
and I overstepped,

36:13.793 --> 36:15.068
and I know that now.

36:15.172 --> 36:17.586
But this was as much for me
as it was for us.

36:17.689 --> 36:19.965
And I was hoping
that it could be ours.

36:20.068 --> 36:21.896
You know, like a family thing.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.241
This again.

36:24.344 --> 36:25.724
Well, this...

36:25.827 --> 36:28.413
this is based off
Granddad's signature.

36:28.517 --> 36:29.758
And the horseshoes
were Stella's idea.

36:29.862 --> 36:31.586
One for our past,

36:31.689 --> 36:35.172
our present
and our future, our...

36:35.275 --> 36:38.482
our evolving
family and business.

36:39.965 --> 36:43.034
Well, hell, William,
when you put it like that...

36:43.137 --> 36:45.034
Dad.

36:45.137 --> 36:48.793
I would really love for you
to a part of this.

36:55.724 --> 36:57.862
Daddy's signature
was damn chicken scratch.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.068
That ain't it.

36:59.172 --> 37:01.620
It's an artist interpretation.

37:01.724 --> 37:03.482
Yeah, well, that ain't it.

37:08.482 --> 37:10.620
This guy was definitely
Grey Flag.

37:12.586 --> 37:15.413
Yeah, I'd say
this about confirms that.

37:15.517 --> 37:18.586
Yeah. I mean, going after vets
in broad daylight--

37:18.689 --> 37:21.379
that feels like
a major escalation.

37:21.482 --> 37:23.275
Well, I mean, an anarchist group

37:23.379 --> 37:25.379
would definitely
take issue with the military,

37:25.482 --> 37:26.793
but specifically my unit?

37:26.896 --> 37:28.482
That's-that's different, Cass.
That's personal.

37:28.586 --> 37:30.034
Well, so, what are you saying?

37:30.137 --> 37:32.034
Are we looking at some sort of
Grey Flag splinter cell?

37:32.137 --> 37:34.275
No. I don't know. Maybe.

37:34.379 --> 37:35.758
But...

37:35.862 --> 37:38.931
The way they left Tommy
on display--

37:39.034 --> 37:42.758
they're kicking it
into a higher gear.

37:42.862 --> 37:44.758
Like they wanted
someone to find him.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.689
You know?
They wanted someone to know

37:46.793 --> 37:48.172
it was them.

37:48.275 --> 37:50.620

37:50.724 --> 37:52.103

someone is targeting my unit.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.689
And they know
a whole lot about you.

38:02.793 --> 38:04.758
- Stuff that isn't necessarily
common knowledge.
- Yeah.

38:04.862 --> 38:06.724
And they're in with Grey Flag.

38:06.827 --> 38:10.068
I mean, Turner, Ortiz,
now Tommy,

38:10.172 --> 38:12.586
all gone.

Yeah, I took the long way

38:56.551 --> 38:58.793
and I swapped cars,
just in case.

39:00.206 --> 39:01.758
So, did we pull it off?

39:01.862 --> 39:03.689
Did everyone buy
you actually firing me?

39:03.793 --> 39:05.655
Well, if the dirty looks
I'm getting are any indication,

39:05.758 --> 39:07.000
then we're in the clear.

Now we wait
