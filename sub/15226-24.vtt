01:25.751 --> 01:28.153
So, whatever
                happened to
                Heather?

01:28.220 --> 01:31.689
Interesting
   you should bring that up.

01:31.757 --> 01:34.625
I ran into her not long ago.

01:34.693 --> 01:38.096
I almost walked right by her.

01:38.164 --> 01:41.499
I wouldn't have recognized her
      in a million years,

01:41.566 --> 01:46.171
except for one little thing
      that never changes.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.539
What's that?

01:47.573 --> 01:49.608
My name.

01:49.675 --> 01:52.377
She yelled, "Hey, Jim!"

01:52.445 --> 01:55.613
Jim, Jim, Jim.

01:55.681 --> 01:56.948
Heather?

01:59.718 --> 02:01.853
You-you were in college?
                         Uh-huh.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.190
You had the education.
You had the wealth.

02:05.258 --> 02:09.360
You had the opportunities,
and you threw that all away.

02:09.428 --> 02:11.796
Now, you have nothing.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.798
I have peace of mind.

02:13.866 --> 02:16.734
Yeah, a very small piece.

02:16.802 --> 02:18.736
Maybe one sixteenth.

02:22.975 --> 02:25.643
Hey, uh, Elaine, have these
    stories helped you any?

02:25.711 --> 02:27.679
Uh, yeah, a little bit.

02:27.746 --> 02:29.080
Yeah, but you know
    what's really gonna help

02:29.148 --> 02:31.415
is that my kids are coming here
         after school.

02:31.483 --> 02:32.917
I mean, they're an important
     part of this decision,

02:32.985 --> 02:34.318
and I've got to hear
        what they think.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.454
Yeah.
                            JIM:
              Good idea, Elaine.

02:36.522 --> 02:39.257
We gain from experience,

02:39.325 --> 02:45.296
but we lose the wisdom that
comes from childlike simplicity.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.732
Right, Latka?

02:49.969 --> 02:52.203
Why-why are you asking me?

02:52.271 --> 02:53.838
There are
three other people here.

02:53.906 --> 02:56.307
I thought
          I'd ask the wisest.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.576
Oh...oh.
                (snorting)

02:58.644 --> 03:01.212
All right, wise guy. That does
it. You say good-bye to your...

03:01.280 --> 03:02.881
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
    No, no, no,
    no, Latka!

03:02.948 --> 03:04.648
Come on. No.
Latka, come on.

03:04.717 --> 03:07.151
Don't you have some kind
of turning point story?

03:07.219 --> 03:09.587
I bet you do. Come on, I bet
you can tell me a good one.

03:09.655 --> 03:11.089
It'll really help me a lot.

03:11.123 --> 03:16.094
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact,
and it will tear your heart out.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.434
(wind whistling)

03:39.151 --> 03:43.088
(speaking native language)

03:56.635 --> 03:58.303
No.

04:58.264 --> 05:01.199
Eh, dong ding, dong ding.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.168
Dong ding.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.502
Dong ding.

05:04.570 --> 05:05.637
Dong ding?

05:05.771 --> 05:07.338
(speaking in native language)

05:07.405 --> 05:08.673
Ding dong.

05:08.774 --> 05:11.008
Oh!
        Ding dong.

05:11.076 --> 05:14.645
Ding dong, ding dong.

05:16.915 --> 05:19.750
Dong ding.

05:19.818 --> 05:21.585
Latka...

05:26.125 --> 05:28.059
Latka...

05:32.598 --> 05:34.932
(speaking native language)

05:39.138 --> 05:40.038
Latka, Latka...

05:45.777 --> 05:47.211
Latka...

05:50.149 --> 05:51.115
No!

05:51.183 --> 05:53.251
<i>Si.</i>

05:55.020 --> 05:58.089
No!

06:00.492 --> 06:01.859
No.

06:04.696 --> 06:05.830
No!

06:46.638 --> 06:48.272
<i>Ja.</i>

06:48.340 --> 06:50.274
Latka...

07:16.802 --> 07:18.770
Mama...

08:20.132 --> 08:23.300
Oh, Mama... Mama.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.805
Bye-bye, Mama.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.678
(Latka and Jim sobbing)

09:42.781 --> 09:47.218
I-I-I miss Mama so much.

09:47.252 --> 09:51.589
Latka, I'm sorry I called
       you simple and childlike.

09:51.656 --> 09:55.493
Oh, it's okay,
sponge brain.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.195
LOUIE:
                           Halt!

09:58.263 --> 09:59.364
What do you kids want?

09:59.431 --> 10:00.964
We're looking
for Mommy.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.799
Oh, Mommy, how cute.
                 Give me a buck.

10:02.835 --> 10:03.967
(Elaine laughs)

10:04.035 --> 10:06.537
Come on, you guys,
          don't look.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.873
You remember Alex and Tony,
           don't you?

10:08.940 --> 10:10.741
Oh, hi, Alex.
Hi, guys.
Jennifer.
                Hey, Tony.

10:10.809 --> 10:12.276
Sit down.

10:12.343 --> 10:14.945
So, what's the
                  big emergency?

10:15.013 --> 10:16.647
Oh, well, it's not
     an emergency exactly.

10:16.715 --> 10:18.049
It's that,

10:18.150 --> 10:23.153
um... well, I've been
              offered a new job,

10:23.222 --> 10:24.988
and the man wants
to know about it right away,

10:25.057 --> 10:26.924
so I thought I'd ask you guys

10:26.991 --> 10:29.226
and what you thought
  before I told him anything.

10:29.294 --> 10:31.328
Take it.
   Yeah, take it.

10:31.396 --> 10:32.663
Well, wait a minute.

10:32.731 --> 10:34.165
We've got some things
       to consider here.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.734
Like what? Leaving
                all this behind?

10:36.802 --> 10:39.070
Yeah, all this?

10:39.104 --> 10:41.439
Jennifer, don't you have
      a mind of your own?

10:41.506 --> 10:44.775
No, she doesn't.
    No, I don't.

10:44.843 --> 10:47.444
Jennifer, stop that.

10:47.512 --> 10:49.546
She's just being cute.

10:49.648 --> 10:51.181
(Alex chuckles)

10:52.817 --> 10:57.088
Okay, all right,
we're going to move to Seattle.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.524
Wait a minute.
   What's this about Seattle?

11:00.592 --> 11:02.726
Oh, well-well,
    that's where the job is.

11:02.794 --> 11:04.895
Oh, it's on, it's on
       the Pacific Ocean,

11:04.963 --> 11:07.231
and there's plenty
   of fresh air and sunshine

11:07.299 --> 11:09.866
and wide open spaces,
     and you kids will have

11:09.934 --> 11:11.469
a lot of nice kids
         to play with.

11:11.503 --> 11:13.805
How's the money?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.640
The money's good.

11:15.707 --> 11:17.441
How's the TV reception?

11:17.508 --> 11:19.109
Good, I suppose.

11:19.177 --> 11:21.279
Take it.
         Yeah, take it.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.680
Are you sure?

11:23.749 --> 11:26.884
Mommy, we love you
and trust you

11:26.951 --> 11:28.786
and know you'll make
the right decisions.

11:28.853 --> 11:30.554
Oh...
                        Yeah!

11:30.622 --> 11:32.956
Guess whose
                  birthday is
                   coming up?

11:34.726 --> 11:36.260
Mommy, can we go now?
The carpool is waiting.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.628
Sure.
                           Yeah,

11:37.696 --> 11:41.231
you know how snarky
               those people get.

11:41.299 --> 11:42.934
Come here, give me a hug.

11:43.001 --> 11:44.034
A big hug.

11:44.102 --> 11:45.202
All right.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.305
Mm!
          Okay... bye.

11:47.372 --> 11:48.973
Guess we'd better go.
                  I know.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.408
Bye-bye. I'll
           see you later.
    Bye!

11:50.476 --> 11:51.709
Bye.
                          JASON:
                  See you, Alex.

11:51.777 --> 11:52.977
Bye, Tony.

11:56.348 --> 11:57.815
(sighs)

11:57.883 --> 11:59.150
(chuckles)

11:59.218 --> 12:00.785
The kids are leaving
                    it up to me.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.086
Mm-hmm.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.088
So, it's my decision.
                  (sighs)

12:04.156 --> 12:07.324
Well, I guess that moving to
Seattle would be best for them.

12:07.392 --> 12:08.592
What about you?

12:08.660 --> 12:11.361
Well, I don't want to go,

12:11.429 --> 12:13.798
but no, no, it wouldn't
      be horrible for me either.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.666
I mean, it's really a
          very good opportunity.

12:15.733 --> 12:18.669
And if I don't take it, ugh,

12:18.736 --> 12:21.471
I could spend the rest
    of my life here like, uh...

12:22.841 --> 12:25.176
Like...
            Like me?

12:25.243 --> 12:26.810
Well, no offense, Alex,

12:26.878 --> 12:29.613
but I'm a little bit more
    ambitious than you are.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.048
Oh, it's no big deal.

12:31.115 --> 12:33.751
My shorts are more
      ambitious than I am.

12:33.818 --> 12:35.819
It wasn't always like that,
       Elaine, you know.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.954
(chuckles)
          Sure, Alex.

12:38.022 --> 12:40.324
No, it wasn't.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.195
Let me just tell you
         a little story

12:44.262 --> 12:46.897
about, uh, ambition
        and Alex Reiger.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.901
(horns honking)

12:53.805 --> 12:56.907
Mr. Ambrose
will see you now.

12:56.975 --> 12:58.409
Oh, God.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.045
Uh, Alex?
             Huh?

13:01.113 --> 13:02.346
Why don't you relax?

13:02.414 --> 13:04.215
I'm sure you got the promotion.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.117
Boy, that'd be something, huh?

13:06.184 --> 13:08.386
Me, regional manager.

13:11.356 --> 13:12.557
Alex!

13:12.624 --> 13:14.625
Hi, Mr. Ambrose.
Nice to see you again.

13:14.692 --> 13:16.527
Hey, y-y-you want a drink?

13:16.595 --> 13:18.162
Uh, thank you, Mr. Ambrose.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.331
Yes, I would.
   I see.

13:22.467 --> 13:25.469
Excuse me, was that
  because I accepted a drink?

13:25.537 --> 13:27.204
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
            it was.

13:27.272 --> 13:29.073
Don't, don't let it bother you.

13:29.174 --> 13:31.075
Here, sit down.
                      Thank you.

13:33.745 --> 13:36.380
Uh, it says here you're
a pretty industrious guy.

13:36.448 --> 13:39.216
It says you're taking six
credits at night school,

13:39.284 --> 13:42.119
your efficiency reports
       are all top-notch,

13:42.187 --> 13:44.555
you support a wife and child.

13:44.622 --> 13:46.690
It says you even drive
     a cab on the weekends.

13:46.758 --> 13:48.759
Yeah, and if this
       doesn't work out,

13:48.827 --> 13:50.595
I'll be driving
        a cab full time.
           (chuckles)

13:50.662 --> 13:53.464
(sighs)
     Let's hope it doesn't
         come to that.

13:53.498 --> 13:55.165
Yeah, right.

13:55.233 --> 13:57.034
Well, all right, tell me
something about yourself, Alex.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.802
Just be informal.

13:58.870 --> 14:02.940
Well, I think I'd be
   a great regional manager.

14:02.975 --> 14:06.477
No, no, no, I want to know
      something about <i>you.</i>

14:06.545 --> 14:08.512
Oh, oh, you mean,
        you want to know

14:08.579 --> 14:10.281
something personal about me?
Exactly.
              Oh.

14:10.348 --> 14:12.616
Okay, uh, well,

14:12.718 --> 14:15.419
something personal is,
          uh... well, I guess

14:15.487 --> 14:18.389
you might say that I'm kind of
    a private type of person

14:18.457 --> 14:21.092
and, uh, with all due
           respect, Mr. Ambrose,

14:21.159 --> 14:23.394
I don't see what this
         has to do with the job.

14:27.498 --> 14:29.733
Uh, in case you haven't
noticed, Mr. Reiger,

14:29.801 --> 14:32.303
I intend to bust your butt
  a little in this interview,

14:32.371 --> 14:35.373
you know, like they did
        in the service.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.242
Oh, I see you don't know.

14:38.276 --> 14:41.011
I know because I was there.

14:41.079 --> 14:42.579
Mr. Ambrose, I begged to go.

14:42.647 --> 14:45.149
I had a medical problem.
     I was eight years old.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.951
Sense of humor.

14:48.019 --> 14:50.521
It's a plus, Mr. Reiger;
  I'm crediting you with that.

14:50.589 --> 14:51.855
You can stop now.

14:51.923 --> 14:54.292
Oh, well, thank goodness.

14:54.359 --> 14:56.193
My next words were
    gonna be "knock, knock".

14:56.228 --> 14:58.428
Not another quip,
                     I swear it.

14:58.496 --> 15:01.865
Right, there's something
I have to bring up here.

15:01.933 --> 15:05.368
I have a report here that says

15:05.436 --> 15:08.405
you punched somebody
            else's timecard.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.574
What? There's a report on that?

15:10.642 --> 15:12.076
Yes, there is.

15:14.078 --> 15:17.681
Holy cow, I mean, I-I didn't
think it was a big deal.

15:17.748 --> 15:21.518
I mean, uh, Mrs. Callan had
  to leave five minutes early

15:21.586 --> 15:23.587
because she had to take her
child to a doctor's appointment,

15:23.655 --> 15:25.389
and I just punched
                   her timecard.

15:25.456 --> 15:27.224
So, it's true, then?

15:27.292 --> 15:29.360
You stole from the company.

15:29.461 --> 15:30.694
No, no, I wouldn't say that.

15:30.762 --> 15:32.562
I mean, it was just
    five minutes, I mean...

15:32.630 --> 15:34.631
That's a rather extreme way
  of putting it, Mr. Ambrose.

15:34.699 --> 15:37.501
Well, how would you
   put it, then, Mr. Reiger?

15:37.602 --> 15:40.404
Well, I'm not sure.

15:40.471 --> 15:42.039
Why don't you put it this way?

15:42.107 --> 15:47.311
"I was wrong, I'm very sorry,
and it will never happen again."

15:47.379 --> 15:49.513
Mr. Ambrose, if you look
  at my performance record...

15:49.580 --> 15:51.182
I know about your
performance record.

15:51.283 --> 15:55.286
The words I want to hear are:
 "I was wrong, I'm very sorry,

15:55.353 --> 15:59.390
and it will never happen again."

15:59.457 --> 16:03.227
Mr. Ambrose, uh,
  please forgive me, but, uh,

16:03.295 --> 16:04.728
I still can't understand

16:04.796 --> 16:06.563
why this has become
       such a big issue.

16:06.631 --> 16:07.999
You're a very strong-willed,

16:08.066 --> 16:10.267
independent, young man,
Mr. Reiger.

16:10.335 --> 16:11.768
These are not bad qualities,

16:11.836 --> 16:14.305
but to succeed with this
company, you're going to

16:14.373 --> 16:16.874
have to be able to
defer to authority.

16:16.941 --> 16:18.709
Now, I don't think you can.

16:21.012 --> 16:23.314
"I was wrong.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.950
I'm very sorry.

16:26.017 --> 16:28.753
It will never happen again."

16:31.656 --> 16:34.424
Well, okay, uh...

16:34.492 --> 16:36.093
I knew there was
                a rule about it,

16:36.161 --> 16:37.928
and I'm sure there was
       a better way to handle it

16:37.996 --> 16:40.297
than I did, and I
           really want this job.

16:40.364 --> 16:42.032
And I'll be... I'll, I'll
      do this company real proud

16:42.100 --> 16:43.533
if I get it,
                     I swear it.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.135
You know, you have
       a real compulsion

16:45.203 --> 16:48.906
to put things your own way,
           don't you?

16:48.973 --> 16:50.808
Uh, I'll look over
        the information.

16:50.876 --> 16:51.842
I'll let you know.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.376
Thank you
for coming in.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.513
Hmm? Right, thank you.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.856
Yes?

17:10.796 --> 17:13.797
I was wrong, I'm very sorry,
and it will never happen again.

17:13.865 --> 17:16.066
You miserable, stupid,
        rotten jack-ass!

17:16.134 --> 17:17.901
I'm sorry,
                      I'm sorry.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.770
Boy, you really have to
          watch out what you say
           in this place! Sorry.

17:22.906 --> 17:27.176
Reiger, you may have missed a
 chance at a successful career,

17:27.244 --> 17:29.112
but you gained one thing.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.082
Me and death cab 412.

17:32.150 --> 17:34.151
It's waiting for
                  you here, sap.

17:42.727 --> 17:45.595
Oh, my God, that's the man
    who offered me the job.

17:45.663 --> 17:47.697
Mr. Thompson, hi.

17:47.765 --> 17:49.400
Oh.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.767
What are you doing here?

17:50.835 --> 17:53.036
Well, I was on my way
           to the airport and I,

17:53.105 --> 17:54.671
well, it began to bother me

17:54.739 --> 17:56.140
that I was going back
             without finding out

17:56.208 --> 17:57.641
if you want
                 the job or not.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.343
I have to know now.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.979
Wait, when you say now, you
don't mean right now, do you?

18:03.047 --> 18:04.081
Of course, I do.

18:04.149 --> 18:05.749
You mean immediately?

18:05.817 --> 18:07.251
Are you a little slow today?

18:07.319 --> 18:09.686
Uh, no.
              I think I'm making
         myself perfectly clear.

18:09.754 --> 18:14.191
Yeah, uh, well, could
I have just a minute?

18:14.259 --> 18:17.327
(sighing):
              Yes, I suppose so.

18:17.395 --> 18:18.728
Uh, I'll wait over here.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.030
Okay, thanks.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.532
Alex, what am I gonna tell him?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.201
I mean,
      what am I gonna do?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.136
This man wants a decision
       right this minute,

18:26.204 --> 18:27.838
and he's giving me one
   minute to think about it.

18:27.905 --> 18:29.139
What am I gonna
           tell him?

18:29.207 --> 18:31.375
Tell him you
                   wet your bed.

18:31.442 --> 18:32.877
What?!

18:32.944 --> 18:35.846
Jim, I'm... I'm not trying
to get out of the army.

18:35.914 --> 18:39.116
I'm trying to decide whether
or not to take a desk job.

18:39.183 --> 18:41.785
Tell him you
                  wet your desk.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.190
Elaine...
What am I gonna do?

18:46.257 --> 18:47.424
What am I gonna tell him?

18:47.491 --> 18:49.059
I can't make a decision
like, just like that.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.128
Elaine, Elaine,
     you're a strong woman

18:51.196 --> 18:53.230
who makes decisions
         all the time.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.931
Not decisions where
I could end up in Seattle

18:54.999 --> 18:57.301
in the rain screaming "Why?!".

18:57.369 --> 18:58.468
Well, then it's simple.

18:58.536 --> 19:00.003
Stay here where
                 the big news is

19:00.071 --> 19:03.440
that Mario's is trying
         out a new tomato paste.

19:03.508 --> 19:05.042
I mean, that man
is standing there

19:05.109 --> 19:06.943
waiting for a mature,
adult decision.

19:11.215 --> 19:13.751
Elaine, look, I, I don't know
       how to help you, but, uh,

19:13.818 --> 19:15.886
I don't think you need
      my help because deep down,

19:15.954 --> 19:18.121
I think you know what
            the right answer is,

19:18.189 --> 19:19.690
and all you gotta do
              is open your mouth

19:19.758 --> 19:20.958
and it's gonna
                 come right out.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.059
Now, trust it.

19:22.126 --> 19:24.261
The right answer
                  will come out.

19:30.902 --> 19:32.803
Mr. Thompson?

19:32.871 --> 19:35.906
Um, I've given this
a lot of thought,

19:35.974 --> 19:39.342
and, uh, my decision
is just not coming to me.

19:39.410 --> 19:42.112
Mr. Thompson, this decision
is very important, you know.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.614
I mean, this is not
the kind of thing...
                            Yes.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.950
It, it, it requires a lot
of time to think, you know,

19:46.017 --> 19:48.351
and I-I-I feel very
pressured right now

19:48.419 --> 19:50.588
and I feel very nervous and,
and it's making it a lot more

19:50.655 --> 19:51.889
difficult than it
should be, you know,

19:51.923 --> 19:54.691
and, uh, and I've asked
my friends for advice

19:54.826 --> 19:56.960
but their advice has
just confused me more.

19:57.028 --> 19:58.428
I love New York!

19:58.496 --> 20:01.064
I love New York, so I...
But Seattle sounds great.

20:01.132 --> 20:02.733
It really does, and the job
sounds wonderful, and I know

20:02.801 --> 20:04.234
Elaine...
it's a very good opportunity

20:04.336 --> 20:05.535
and I don't want
to really blow it.

20:05.603 --> 20:07.204
You see, my children's,
my children will be

20:07.271 --> 20:09.673
affected by this, too,
an-and if I didn't have to

20:09.774 --> 20:11.475
think about them, if I only
had to think about myself,

20:11.543 --> 20:13.611
then my decision would
be just as difficult

20:13.678 --> 20:15.379
because of the pressure
that you're putting on me.

20:15.447 --> 20:16.913
I mean, what kind
of person are you

20:16.981 --> 20:18.582
that you could do
this to somebody else?

20:18.650 --> 20:20.517
I mean, just because you
have a stupid plane to catch

20:20.585 --> 20:21.918
doesn't mean that
I have to make

20:21.986 --> 20:24.888
the most important decision
of my life so quickly!

20:24.956 --> 20:26.390
(crying)

20:26.458 --> 20:30.293
Elaine, get ahold of
             yourself. Huh? I...

20:30.362 --> 20:33.563
(sobbing)

20:33.665 --> 20:35.632
You're right.
I'm sorry.

20:37.568 --> 20:39.003
You're right.

20:39.070 --> 20:41.838
You're entitled
to a decision.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.610
I want that job, Mr. Thompson.

20:49.047 --> 20:50.547
Whew!

20:50.614 --> 20:52.882
Oh, I feel so much better.

20:52.950 --> 20:57.321
Oh, God, that was easier
than I thought.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.722
So, when do I start?

20:58.790 --> 21:01.124
Start what? Shock treatments?

21:03.361 --> 21:05.395
Elaine, you're much
  too emotionally high-strung

21:05.463 --> 21:07.397
for this job. I'm sorry, but...

21:07.499 --> 21:09.199
Wait a minute,
         wait a minute.

21:09.266 --> 21:11.702
After all that, you're not
     gonna give me the job?

21:11.769 --> 21:12.970
Well, I don't think
               there's any cause

21:13.037 --> 21:14.705
for <i>that</i> sort of
              thing, Miss Nardo.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.840
And you're not only not
gonna give me the job,
             Now, just a minute!

21:16.908 --> 21:18.542
you also called me
emotionally high-strung.
             Now, wait a minute!

21:18.609 --> 21:20.377
You know, it's difficult to
make a decision in two seconds!

21:20.445 --> 21:21.011
(groans)

21:23.048 --> 21:24.681
I just hit that man.

21:26.851 --> 21:28.018
I just hit him!
I know.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.419
He's turning red!
Elaine...

21:29.487 --> 21:31.988
As your employment counselor,
I have a few things

21:32.056 --> 21:33.957
that I would like
to talk over with you.
                           Alex,

21:34.024 --> 21:35.625
Alex, tell me I didn't
           really want that job,

21:35.693 --> 21:37.160
otherwise I wouldn't have
     done something that stupid.

21:37.228 --> 21:39.029
I mean, tell me I...
           Say something because

21:39.097 --> 21:41.031
you're not saying anything
         to make me feel better.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.734
You didn't kill him.

21:45.537 --> 21:49.439
Oh, Mr. Thompson,
    I... (stammering)

21:49.507 --> 21:52.275
if you change your mind,
       will you call me?

21:58.316 --> 22:01.251
I don't think
                  he'll call me.

22:04.088 --> 22:06.456
You know, Elaine,
I think you lucked out.

22:06.524 --> 22:09.993
As far as I'm concerned,
you got the best job

22:10.060 --> 22:13.196
you ever had,
being Elaine Nardo.

22:14.899 --> 22:17.467
Oh, Alex, that's so sweet.

22:17.535 --> 22:20.637
Aw, you like me,
                   that's sweet.

22:20.705 --> 22:24.374
Come on.
                    Oh...

22:24.442 --> 22:25.909
We didn't want
to tell you,

22:25.977 --> 22:29.546
but you would've felt
terrible without us.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.447
Oh, I know.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.750
I love you guys so much.

22:33.817 --> 22:37.554
I mean, that's the real reason
     why I didn't take this job.

22:37.621 --> 22:39.989
(sighs)

22:40.058 --> 22:42.926
I'm gonna go tell my kids.

22:43.027 --> 22:44.461
Bye.

22:44.528 --> 22:46.263
She did take the job!

22:46.331 --> 22:48.198
Shh!

22:59.778 --> 23:02.179
(theme song playing)

23:26.671 --> 23:28.004
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>
