Well, when you

up a 17-year-old girl

Wow, I've never seen a fake I.D.
as sophisticated as this.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.792
If these got
into the wrong hands,

07:53.792 --> 07:56.125
they could be a huge threat
to national security.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.917
That's what I was trying
to tell her father

07:57.917 --> 08:01.000
before he fell on all those
bullets coming out of my gun.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.291
Yes, Dad.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.417
And this is
all my fault.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.750
I used Steve to make
money, and-and...

19:36.458 --> 19:39.125
Kevin Ramage!

19:43.083 --> 19:45.750
Steve, thank God
you're okay.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.709
Well, Smith, you
solved the case.

19:47.709 --> 19:49.542
You found Guttenberg.
Good work.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.041
Take her away.

19:51.041 --> 19:55.291
But, sir, Guttenberg or not,
I can't arrest my own daughter.

19:55.291 --> 19:57.333
Can you do it?

19:58.667 --> 20:00.917
Smith, your lawyer's
here to see you.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.083
Lawyer?

20:02.083 --> 20:03.542
He says he's your lawyer.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.667
His official lawyer card
checks out.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.500
Hi, Steve.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.333
Hayley, why'd you take
the rap for me?

20:12.333 --> 20:14.583
I... I felt bad.

20:14.583 --> 20:17.667
Your life was in danger,
and it was all because of me.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.291
You had a skill,
and I-I took advantage of it.

20:20.291 --> 20:21.834
But we were partners,

20:21.834 --> 20:24.125
and then you told those girls
I was a loser.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.625
I know. I'm sorry.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.542
They-they put me on the spot,

20:27.542 --> 20:29.750
and I was, I was just trying
to look cool.

20:29.750 --> 20:33.166
I guess I deserve to be in here
for the next ten years.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.709
See you when I'm 29.

20:35.709 --> 20:37.542
Oh, you mean...

20:37.542 --> 20:39.208
yesterday?

20:40.917 --> 20:42.291
Guard!

20:42.291 --> 20:43.375
Thanks, little brother.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.625
Any time, sis.

20:44.625 --> 20:47.291
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.500
Open up cellblock H!

20:51.500 --> 20:55.125
Surprise inspection, ladies!
Let's whip 'em out!

20:55.125 --> 20:57.083
What a loser.
