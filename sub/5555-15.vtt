00:26.695 --> 00:28.729
- Good morning.
- Hey.

00:28.764 --> 00:29.796
I'm surprised you're up,

00:29.832 --> 00:31.865
given how late you got
in from L.A. last night.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.934
Oh. Mm.

00:33.969 --> 00:35.369
Well, I thought we could
play a little catch up

00:35.404 --> 00:36.336
before you got off to work.

00:36.372 --> 00:37.804
Oh!

00:37.840 --> 00:39.172
Beckett: I'm all ears.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.240
Thanks.

00:40.275 --> 00:41.608
Careful.
I made it a little strong this morning.

00:41.643 --> 00:42.843
Okay.

00:42.878 --> 00:44.277
Mm!

00:44.313 --> 00:47.014
[Laughs] Yes, that will wake the dead.

00:47.049 --> 00:48.815
Certainly make your job a lot easier.

00:48.851 --> 00:50.117
[Sighs] One interview,

00:50.152 --> 00:52.119
"He's the guy who killed me,"
case closed.

00:52.154 --> 00:54.454
Castle, I'm guessing that you found out

00:54.490 --> 00:56.089
something about your missing time,

00:56.125 --> 00:58.492
and that's what you want
to catch up with me on.

00:58.527 --> 00:59.626
Uh... Uh, yeah.

00:59.661 --> 01:00.927
Actually, yeah, I did. Um...

01:00.963 --> 01:03.231
But I was thinking how
about we eat first?

01:03.443 --> 01:04.131
Oh.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.665
Wow. That bad?

01:05.701 --> 01:06.933
[Door opens] Martha: Knock-knock.

01:06.969 --> 01:08.135
Are you decent?

01:08.170 --> 01:09.403
[Door closes] Mother!

01:09.438 --> 01:10.904
Oh.

01:10.939 --> 01:12.506
Welcome home, darling.

01:12.541 --> 01:13.874
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

01:13.909 --> 01:16.243
You know, you... you could've...
could've called first.

01:16.278 --> 01:18.178
I didn't want to disturb you
in case you wanted to sleep in.

01:18.213 --> 01:19.813
- Ah.
- Oh, darling.

01:19.848 --> 01:22.215
I thought I would just sneak in

01:22.251 --> 01:24.384
and make my boy a little breakfast.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.786
- Oh.
- Oh, well, phooey.

01:25.854 --> 01:27.054
You beat me to it.

01:27.089 --> 01:28.355
- Yeah, I... Well...
- You expecting someone?

01:28.390 --> 01:30.123
Oh, just old habit.

01:30.159 --> 01:32.159
So, uh, did you really come
just to make me breakfast?

01:32.194 --> 01:33.660
Because that does not sound like you.

01:33.695 --> 01:35.095
Oh, pishposh.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.129
Actually,

01:36.165 --> 01:38.231
I just got an advanced copy of my book

01:38.267 --> 01:40.467
that I wanted you to see.

01:40.502 --> 01:43.170
<i>Unsolicited Advice</i> by Martha Rodgers.

01:43.205 --> 01:45.572
Mother, I'm so proud of you! [Laughs]

01:45.607 --> 01:48.575
Oh, thank you. Read the dedication.

01:51.580 --> 01:53.257
"For Richard.

01:54.283 --> 01:56.116
Without your constant stumbles in life,

01:56.151 --> 01:59.019
the advice in this book would
not have been possible."

01:59.054 --> 02:00.053
Constant stumbles?

02:00.089 --> 02:01.054
Let's not make this about you.

02:01.090 --> 02:02.255
It... [Cellphone rings]

02:02.291 --> 02:03.356
One second.

02:03.392 --> 02:04.324
[Sighs]

02:04.359 --> 02:05.592
Hey, where are you?

02:05.627 --> 02:06.660
Beckett: Hallway.

02:06.695 --> 02:08.961
I, uh, snuck out through the bedroom.

02:08.997 --> 02:10.896
That would be the height of irony, huh?

02:10.933 --> 02:11.433
[Chuckles]

02:11.499 --> 02:14.134
Manage to successfully hide
our relationship from LokSat

02:14.169 --> 02:15.535
only to get outed by your mom.

02:15.571 --> 02:16.870
Look,
do you want me to sneak back at lunch

02:16.905 --> 02:18.038
so we can talk about what you found?

02:18.073 --> 02:19.339
No, no. Okay. [Stammers]

02:19.374 --> 02:20.307
I... I'll see you tonight.

02:20.342 --> 02:21.741
Okay. [Line beeps]

02:21.777 --> 02:22.809
Listen, I got to go.

02:22.845 --> 02:23.777
[Whispering] I love you.

02:23.812 --> 02:25.112
Bye.

02:25.147 --> 02:26.480
So, I just wanted to say...

02:26.515 --> 02:27.981
This is Beckett.

02:28.016 --> 02:30.150
All right, guys. What do we got?

02:30.185 --> 02:31.852
Esposito: Right now,
our victim is a John Doe.

02:31.887 --> 02:33.386
There's no phone or I.D. on the victim,

02:33.422 --> 02:35.355
but we scanned his prints
and we're running them now.

02:35.390 --> 02:36.890
From the blood trail,
looks like he was shot

02:36.925 --> 02:38.225
around the corner and collapsed here.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.259
Okay, I'm still not sure

02:39.294 --> 02:40.794
why you needed the captain to come down.

02:40.829 --> 02:42.529
Our victim was shot in the back.

02:42.564 --> 02:44.297
He bled out within a few minutes,

02:44.333 --> 02:46.900
then the killer took
the time and the risk

02:46.935 --> 02:48.268
to cut out the bullet.

02:48.303 --> 02:49.870
Obviously, our killer was worried

02:49.905 --> 02:51.371
that ballistics would lead back to him.

02:51.406 --> 02:52.439
[Camera shutter clicks]

02:52.474 --> 02:54.107
Which means the gun's
already in the system.

02:54.143 --> 02:55.408
Do you have a time of death?

02:55.444 --> 02:56.543
Between 9:00 and midnight.

02:56.578 --> 02:58.245
Ryan:
Got a hit on the fingerprint match.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.482
Our victim's name is Daniel Bardot.

03:05.654 --> 03:07.621
He's a Recruit Officer
at the NYPD Academy.

03:10.092 --> 03:11.057
He's one of us.

03:13.162 --> 03:15.028
Esposito: We got Bardot's phone records.

03:15.063 --> 03:16.897
Unfortunately,
the GPS was turned off on his cell.

03:16.932 --> 03:18.965
We still don't know what he
was doing in that neighborhood.

03:19.001 --> 03:20.300
What about calls?

03:20.335 --> 03:22.636
Last call he made was at 5:30
to a law firm in midtown.

03:22.671 --> 03:23.870
It only lasted a minute.

03:23.906 --> 03:25.138
Vikram's checking it out.

03:25.174 --> 03:27.641
My granny's stronger than all
three of you guys combined!

03:27.676 --> 03:29.543
- Bad flashbacks, bro?
- You got to want it!

03:29.578 --> 03:32.112
Pushups were the answer to everything
around this place.

03:32.147 --> 03:34.381
Police work is more than
just strength and endurance.

03:34.416 --> 03:35.749
It's about intellectual rigor.

03:35.784 --> 03:38.285
Oh, come on, you guys.
It wasn't all that bad here.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.087
Says the Academy All-Star.

03:41.123 --> 03:43.590
Oh, look. Recruit Officer Beckett.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.358
Oh! Recruit Officer Beckett.

03:45.394 --> 03:47.994
Ah. [Clicks tongue]
Recruit Officer Beckett.

03:48.030 --> 03:49.863
I'm gonna go download with
the Academy Commissioner.

03:49.898 --> 03:51.364
You guys head over to
Bardot's dorm room.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.035
There's got to be a clue
here as to who his killer is.

03:55.070 --> 03:56.203
[Knock on door]

03:56.238 --> 03:57.938
Hi, Deputy Commissioner Malone.

03:57.973 --> 03:58.972
I'm Captain Kate Beckett.

03:59.007 --> 04:00.473
Captain, nice to finally meet you.

04:00.509 --> 04:02.075
You're a bit of a legend
around these parts.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.510
Recruits have been
gunning for your records

04:03.545 --> 04:04.644
since I got here five years ago.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.979
So far, no one's gotten close.

04:06.014 --> 04:07.214
Yeah, well, they will.

04:07.249 --> 04:08.866
Every record falls in the end.

04:09.585 --> 04:10.884
Here's Bardot's file.

04:10.953 --> 04:12.919
I've assigned his instructor,
Sergeant Ortiz,

04:12.955 --> 04:14.588
to be your liaison.

04:14.623 --> 04:15.722
You know Sergeant Ortiz?

04:15.757 --> 04:16.723
Yeah, I do.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.524
He was my instructor when I was here.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.060
His tough love is the reason

04:20.095 --> 04:21.761
my name's on all of
those plaques out there.

04:21.797 --> 04:23.430
[Knock on door] Come in, Sergeant.

04:23.465 --> 04:25.432
Thank you, sir.

04:27.970 --> 04:29.269
Captain Beckett.

04:29.304 --> 04:31.113
It's so good to see you, Sergeant.

04:32.341 --> 04:33.940
So, what can you tell
me about Daniel Bardot?

04:33.976 --> 04:35.442
[Clears throat] Malone:
He was an admirable kid.

04:35.477 --> 04:36.810
Got a rough start in life.

04:36.845 --> 04:38.845
His parents were killed in
a robbery when he was nine.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.580
Not surprising when you
grow up in Hunts Point.

04:40.616 --> 04:41.982
The Irish Mafia's backyard.

04:42.017 --> 04:43.516
There's not a lot of good cops

04:43.552 --> 04:45.151
coming out of that dirty furnace.

04:45.187 --> 04:46.920
Don't have to tell me.

04:46.955 --> 04:47.988
I went toe-to-toe

04:48.023 --> 04:49.656
with that 'hood "Lucky Jack" Flanagan

04:49.691 --> 04:51.625
long before I was teaching you.

04:51.660 --> 04:53.460
Never could make a
charge stick on that guy.

04:53.495 --> 04:55.528
Bardot must have had a lot of fortitude

04:55.564 --> 04:56.863
to make it all the way over here.

04:56.898 --> 04:58.131
He was definitely driven.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.099
But he also had a tendency

04:59.134 --> 05:00.467
to let emotion get the best of him.

05:00.502 --> 05:02.535
He'd rush into situations
without thinking,

05:02.571 --> 05:04.237
and it had gotten worse
in the last few days.

05:04.273 --> 05:05.205
What do you mean?

05:05.240 --> 05:08.208
He kept fumbling
a tactical drill he usually aced,

05:08.243 --> 05:09.909
so I pulled him aside
and confronted him.

05:09.945 --> 05:11.678
He said he'd screwed something
up in his personal life.

05:11.713 --> 05:12.712
He didn't know what to do.

05:12.748 --> 05:15.448
I told him to cowboy up, set it right.

05:15.484 --> 05:18.439
And now I'm thinking he
died trying to do just that.

05:18.887 --> 05:21.187
Hayley: You didn't tell Kate
what happened in Los Angeles?

05:21.223 --> 05:22.689
- You chickened out.
- I did not chicken out, all right?

05:22.724 --> 05:23.957
I was interrupted.

05:23.992 --> 05:26.587
Now I'm wondering whether it
was a sign from the universe.

05:27.182 --> 05:27.961
What?

05:28.030 --> 05:30.430
The universe sent your
mother to tell you what?

05:30.465 --> 05:32.198
To take my own advice. [Tablet beeps]

05:32.234 --> 05:36.703
<i>I am erasing our mind for a reason...</i>

05:36.738 --> 05:38.772
- <i>To protect Kate.</i>
- Okay.

05:38.807 --> 05:39.806
[Tablet beeps] Enough.

05:39.841 --> 05:41.641
Go and talk to your wife.

05:41.677 --> 05:43.710
If I hadn't wiped my memory,

05:43.745 --> 05:46.012
Beckett's friends at the A.G.'s
office might still be alive.

05:46.048 --> 05:47.213
What if she can't forgive me?

05:47.249 --> 05:49.182
That decision's not yours to make, Rick.

05:49.217 --> 05:50.483
[Door opens]

05:50.519 --> 05:51.918
[Light switch clicks]

05:51.953 --> 05:55.855
What? Bardot's room is huge
compared to the one I lived in.

05:55.891 --> 05:57.557
Thing was barely a closet.

05:57.592 --> 05:59.292
Yeah, I never really bunked on campus.

05:59.328 --> 06:01.628
I got enough of communal
living when I was in the army.

06:01.663 --> 06:03.630
And besides, you can't really bring

06:03.665 --> 06:06.232
a ménage of cop groupies
home to a dorm room.

06:06.268 --> 06:07.434
What are you doing in here?

06:07.469 --> 06:09.035
We're investigating a homicide.
Who are you?

06:09.071 --> 06:10.570
Recruit Officer Rachel Decker.

06:10.605 --> 06:11.604
Did you know Daniel Bardot?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.606
Yes, sir. He was in my training company.

06:13.642 --> 06:15.075
You know what he was doing last night?

06:15.110 --> 06:17.610
No, sir. We invited him to go
out with us, but he begged off.

06:17.679 --> 06:20.046
Sir, if there's any way I can
help with this investigation,

06:20.082 --> 06:21.147
I want in.

06:21.183 --> 06:22.782
You forget your place, Decker?

06:22.818 --> 06:24.884
You're not even a lowly uniform.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.551
What could you possibly offer
these distinguished detectives?

06:30.302 --> 06:31.558
Insight.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.593
Did you train alongside Officer Bardot?

06:33.628 --> 06:34.594
Yes, ma'am.

06:34.629 --> 06:36.229
So you forged a bond with him

06:36.264 --> 06:38.064
against the evil Sergeant Ortiz,

06:38.100 --> 06:39.833
which means you have
information on Bardot

06:39.868 --> 06:42.302
that his higher-ups do not.
Is that correct, recruit?

06:42.337 --> 06:43.403
Yes.

06:43.438 --> 06:44.471
So then tell me,
what was he struggling with?

06:44.506 --> 06:46.422
What did he need to set right?

06:47.743 --> 06:49.107
I don't know.

06:49.279 --> 06:50.143
Sorry.

06:50.178 --> 06:52.178
Way to face-plant in front
of a superior, Decker.

06:52.214 --> 06:54.314
This is Captain Beckett.

06:54.349 --> 06:55.615
Captain, I...

06:55.650 --> 06:56.683
You're dismissed, recruit.

07:00.288 --> 07:01.659
That was a little harsh,
don't you think?

07:01.712 --> 07:02.479
I do not.

07:02.571 --> 07:04.758
Being put in her place is
exactly what Decker needs.

07:04.793 --> 07:06.159
She's the real deal.

07:06.194 --> 07:07.994
Her name could very well
be on all your trophies

07:08.029 --> 07:09.362
by the time she's done here.

07:09.398 --> 07:11.331
But she desperately needs
to learn a little humility.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.932
[Cellphone rings] Mm.

07:12.968 --> 07:14.634
[Cellphone beeps]

07:14.669 --> 07:16.369
Lanie, you find anything in the autopsy?

07:16.405 --> 07:17.437
I did.

07:17.472 --> 07:18.605
The bullet broke up when it hit a rib.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.340
Bardot's killer didn't
get all the pieces.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.442
I managed to pull a small
fragment from a kidney.

07:22.477 --> 07:24.043
I got a ballistics match.

07:24.079 --> 07:26.246
The 9mm that fired it
is in the database.

07:26.281 --> 07:29.282
Kate, it's NYPD...

07:29.317 --> 07:32.485
registered to the Academy.

07:32.521 --> 07:35.054
The murder weapon is missing
from the weapons cage

07:35.090 --> 07:37.457
assigned to Bardot's company,
Company 38.

07:37.492 --> 07:40.026
Lock on the CCTV security
closet was jimmied open.

07:40.061 --> 07:42.829
Someone killed the security
cameras in the weapons room

07:42.864 --> 07:46.032
between 7:30 and 7:35 last night.

07:46.067 --> 07:47.700
At that hour, it's mainly recruits

07:47.736 --> 07:49.035
who are left in the building.

07:49.070 --> 07:51.971
All faculty resides off-campus.

07:52.007 --> 07:53.773
And only members of Company 38

07:53.809 --> 07:55.442
have access to that weapons cage.

07:59.314 --> 08:02.749
So our killer is one of
Bardot's fellow recruits.

08:05.074 --> 08:06.553
14 suspects

08:06.588 --> 08:09.689
who eat, drink, and sleep police
training and techniques...

08:09.724 --> 08:11.256
Captain on deck!

08:14.062 --> 08:17.195
Who have spent months learning
how we catch killers...

08:20.541 --> 08:24.404
which makes them uniquely
equipped to plan a murder.

08:24.439 --> 08:26.372
So we are gonna have to
use every trick in the book

08:26.408 --> 08:29.242
to uncover who killed Daniel Bardot.

08:29.277 --> 08:31.678

Fidelis Ad Mortem

08:31.713 --> 08:34.179
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

08:35.013 --> 08:37.354
At ease, officers. Take a seat.

08:40.409 --> 08:41.692
Ortiz: Company 38,

08:41.745 --> 08:44.550
this is Captain Beckett
of the 12th Precinct.

08:44.801 --> 08:46.772
Because of last night's tragic event,

08:46.822 --> 08:50.224
she will be joining us today
as a special guest instructor.

08:50.259 --> 08:53.060
Respect her,
or your ass will meet my boot.

08:53.095 --> 08:55.095
Thank you, Sergeant.

08:55.130 --> 08:56.763
First of all, let me assure you

08:56.832 --> 09:00.400
that I have the <i> best</i> NYPD detectives

09:00.436 --> 09:02.870
looking into Officer Bardot's murder.

09:02.905 --> 09:05.572
That being said,
this is not going to be the last time

09:05.608 --> 09:07.074
that you lose one of your coworkers.

09:07.109 --> 09:09.443
That is a reality of this job.

09:09.478 --> 09:11.545
The temptation

09:11.580 --> 09:15.082
is going to be to remain stoic
in the face of adversity,

09:15.117 --> 09:18.885
to lock up your emotions
so as not to appear weak.

09:19.021 --> 09:21.200
That is a mistake.

09:21.504 --> 09:23.123
Avoid that temptation at all costs.

09:23.159 --> 09:24.191
Trust me.

09:24.226 --> 09:26.460
I have been at the edge of that map,

09:26.495 --> 09:29.062
and monsters lie there.

09:32.032 --> 09:33.738
Now look around.

09:33.897 --> 09:35.869
This is your team.

09:37.306 --> 09:39.873
No one is gonna understand
what you are feeling

09:39.909 --> 09:42.609
better than the woman or
man sitting next to you,

09:42.645 --> 09:44.611
so use them.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.817
Officer Chambers.

09:49.852 --> 09:51.985
I'm very sorry about the
loss of your fellow recruit.

09:52.021 --> 09:53.053
How do you feel?

09:53.089 --> 09:55.022
The city lost a great cop, ma'am.

09:55.057 --> 09:56.023
We should all aspire

09:56.058 --> 09:57.725
to be a guardian of justice like he was.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.394
Is that a PR statement for the <i> Post?</i>

10:00.429 --> 10:02.563
One of your brothers was gunned down.

10:02.598 --> 10:03.964
I asked you how you felt.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.532
We feel pissed off, Captain.

10:05.568 --> 10:06.734
Yeah, set us loose.

10:06.802 --> 10:08.936
Let us track down the son
of a bitch who did this.

10:08.971 --> 10:11.638
Beckett: Well, Officer Decker
already volunteered her services

10:11.674 --> 10:13.607
for that very role.

10:13.642 --> 10:15.542
The offer still stands, Captain.

10:15.578 --> 10:17.111
And frankly, I didn't become a cop

10:17.146 --> 10:18.946
to get in touch with my feelings.

10:18.981 --> 10:21.448
I'm here because bad
people exist in the world.

10:21.484 --> 10:23.083
And I can't wait to start

10:23.119 --> 10:25.786
putting them in prison
where they belong.

10:25.821 --> 10:29.256
All right.
Get ready for a training session.

10:29.291 --> 10:31.925
I just checked the front gate log.

10:31.961 --> 10:33.660
10 of the recruits were off-campus

10:33.696 --> 10:35.396
at the time of Bardot's murder.

10:39.168 --> 10:42.302
All right. Well, these three
all have the same hand stamp.

10:42.338 --> 10:43.837
The club across the street

10:43.873 --> 10:46.774
had a sign from last
night offering karaoke.

10:46.809 --> 10:49.276
So I'm gonna have my detectives
run these photos over there,

10:49.311 --> 10:51.111
but I'm guessing
they're gonna alibi out.

10:51.147 --> 10:53.814
Leaving these seven. Mm-hmm.

10:53.849 --> 10:55.015
You know, if word gets out

10:55.050 --> 10:56.417
that these recruits are suspects,

10:56.452 --> 10:57.484
it'll haunt their careers.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.286
Even if proved innocent.

10:59.321 --> 11:00.821
Well, then we need to
keep it to a tight circle.

11:00.856 --> 11:02.523
So what's the next move?

11:02.558 --> 11:03.690
Well, I think it's a safe bet

11:03.726 --> 11:05.492
that if one of these
seven killed Bardot,

11:05.528 --> 11:06.627
it was their first murder.

11:06.662 --> 11:08.729
And unless they're a
complete psychopath...

11:08.764 --> 11:10.798
Which the psych eval
would have revealed...

11:10.833 --> 11:13.467
Then they spent a long,
dark night of the soul,

11:13.502 --> 11:15.068
reliving the recoil of the gun

11:15.137 --> 11:16.970
and the knife cutting into Bardot's body

11:17.006 --> 11:18.205
to get that bullet out.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.406
Meaning what?

11:19.442 --> 11:21.642
Meaning they're on a razor's edge.

11:21.677 --> 11:23.277
And I want to put them in
a high-stress simulation

11:23.312 --> 11:25.579
and watch them shoot a gun.

11:25.614 --> 11:26.980
Man: <i>Lopez, Takata, you're up.</i>

11:27.016 --> 11:28.782
[Buzzer sounds]

11:34.757 --> 11:36.824
There. That pause. What is that?

11:36.859 --> 11:39.359
Hate to break it to you,
but that's normal for Takata.

11:39.395 --> 11:42.763
Guy's got a hitch in his
giddy-up I cannot cure.

11:42.798 --> 11:43.997
<i>Decker, Chambers, you're up.</i>

11:44.033 --> 11:45.165
[Buzzer sounds]

11:45.201 --> 11:46.166
[Hydraulics hiss]

11:46.235 --> 11:47.534
[Paintball gun fires]

11:50.139 --> 11:51.905
What about Decker?

11:51.941 --> 11:53.841
The other recruits
don't seem to like her.

11:53.909 --> 11:55.843
Every recruit's got a
problem with Decker.

11:55.878 --> 11:58.011
She's ultra-focused,
competitive as hell,

11:58.047 --> 11:59.680
and walled off from everyone.

11:59.715 --> 12:01.081
Kind of like you were.

12:01.116 --> 12:02.382
[Buzzer sounds]

12:04.587 --> 12:05.786
Hey, wait a second.

12:05.821 --> 12:07.020
Bardot's tactical gear,

12:07.056 --> 12:08.922
we didn't find it in his dorm room.

12:08.958 --> 12:10.757
No, we put lockers in so
they could keep it here.

12:10.793 --> 12:13.360
- And which locker is Bardot's?
- Seven.

12:16.065 --> 12:17.130
Ortiz: Am I witnessing

12:17.166 --> 12:19.399
one of Kate Beckett's famous hunches?

12:26.876 --> 12:29.743
The lab couldn't pull any
prints off that blue index card.

12:29.778 --> 12:31.144
Got our handwriting expert

12:31.180 --> 12:33.180
comparing against samples
from the other suspects,

12:33.215 --> 12:35.382
but he's not optimistic
given the block letters.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.683
- Is that Beckett?
- Yeah.

12:36.719 --> 12:38.218
Let me holler at her. Beckett.

12:38.254 --> 12:40.521
Hey, you remember that
phone call that Bardot made

12:40.556 --> 12:42.422
to that midtown law
firm on the day he died?

12:42.458 --> 12:45.592
Yeah, I went over there.
Only nobody remembers the call.

12:45.628 --> 12:48.395
So without more to go on,
it looks like a dead end.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.397
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

12:50.432 --> 12:52.533
[Telephone rings]

12:52.568 --> 12:53.867
Beckett's not here.

12:53.903 --> 12:57.337
She's at the Police Academy
working a high-profile murder.

12:57.373 --> 12:59.139
One of the recruit officers was killed.

12:59.174 --> 13:01.375
That's a little close to home.
These the suspects?

13:01.410 --> 13:03.310
Yeah, and three more
recruits just alibi'd out.

13:03.345 --> 13:05.312
Your victim was killed
by a fellow recruit?

13:05.347 --> 13:06.346
Appears so.

13:06.382 --> 13:07.981
And word is these four
were watching the fights

13:08.017 --> 13:10.117
at a local boxing gym at
the time of the murder,

13:10.152 --> 13:11.385
but that alibi's soft.

13:11.420 --> 13:12.986
Hey, just spoke with Liz from Vice.

13:13.022 --> 13:14.955
The boxing gym is a notorious hotspot

13:14.990 --> 13:16.657
for illegal steroids.

13:16.692 --> 13:18.725
Rumor has it that one of the trainers

13:18.761 --> 13:20.227
was dealing to a cop at the Academy.

13:20.262 --> 13:24.431
So the victim, Bardot,
stumbled onto a dirty cop.

13:24.466 --> 13:25.933
Well,
that would explain the threatening note.

13:25.968 --> 13:27.000
"Dead men tell no tales."

13:27.069 --> 13:28.869
But Bardot wouldn't back down,

13:28.904 --> 13:30.637
- so the cop kills him.
- Mm.

13:30.673 --> 13:32.239
What was the name of the
trainer that was dealing?

13:32.274 --> 13:34.174
Arthur Stinson,

13:34.209 --> 13:35.242
today's not your lucky day.

13:35.277 --> 13:36.443
[Door closes]

13:36.478 --> 13:38.211
It's actually the complete
opposite of your lucky day.

13:38.247 --> 13:39.546
Stinson: Look, man. I don't know

13:39.582 --> 13:41.481
what people been telling you,
but I don't sell drugs.

13:41.517 --> 13:42.783
Oh, really?

13:42.818 --> 13:44.318
'Cause that's exactly what
they've been telling us.

13:44.353 --> 13:45.519
And the stash that we found

13:45.554 --> 13:47.421
hidden in the false bottom
of your locker confirms it.

13:47.456 --> 13:48.422
So, here's the deal.

13:48.457 --> 13:50.090
We say nice things
about you to the D.A.,

13:50.125 --> 13:51.592
maybe get you a suspended sentence

13:51.627 --> 13:53.760
if you give up that cop
you've been dealing to

13:53.796 --> 13:54.761
at the Academy.

13:56.098 --> 13:57.397
But I can't.

13:57.433 --> 13:58.832
Well, I guess we're done here, then.

13:58.867 --> 13:59.833
Say hi to the jury for us.

13:59.868 --> 14:01.168
I-I can't because we've never met.

14:01.203 --> 14:02.869
All right? Look. [Sighs]

14:02.905 --> 14:04.438
The cop puts cash in the locker.

14:04.473 --> 14:06.039
I pick it up, I leave the drugs.

14:06.075 --> 14:07.007
That's it.

14:07.042 --> 14:08.041
So how do you know

14:08.077 --> 14:09.409
that you're dealing to a police officer?

14:09.445 --> 14:10.844
The buyer only arranges pickups

14:10.879 --> 14:12.713
on "Police Appreciation" nights.

14:12.748 --> 14:15.515
The NYPD doesn't pay a cover,
the gym's crawling with cops.

14:15.551 --> 14:16.984
How's the buyer contact you?

14:17.019 --> 14:19.353
They shove an index card in my locker.

14:19.388 --> 14:21.254
Note says when they want delivery.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.789
Hold on. A blue index card?

14:22.825 --> 14:24.658
Yeah.

14:24.693 --> 14:27.728
I think I know how Beckett
can smoke out our killer.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.033
The thing about
interviewing a suspect is

14:33.068 --> 14:35.202
you have to find what works for you...

14:35.237 --> 14:36.870
Your own personal style.

14:36.905 --> 14:39.306
Now, some people like good cop/bad cop.

14:39.341 --> 14:41.074
Others like bad cop/worse cop.

14:41.110 --> 14:43.377
But choosing just one
method is a mistake.

14:43.412 --> 14:44.978
Every suspect is different.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.947
And sometimes you don't know
how you're gonna go at them

14:47.016 --> 14:48.148
until they start talking

14:48.183 --> 14:50.050
because you only get one
shot in interrogation,

14:50.085 --> 14:54.662
and if you screw it up,
a killer might walk free.

14:55.591 --> 14:58.558
So, I want to try something.

14:58.594 --> 14:59.860
I need a volunteer.

15:01.997 --> 15:04.631
Yeah, Lopez.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.560
Right over here.

15:07.536 --> 15:09.236
Ms. Lopez, thank you for coming in.

15:09.271 --> 15:11.271
Anything I can do to help the NYPD.

15:11.306 --> 15:13.707
Uh, so a crime was committed last night,

15:13.742 --> 15:14.908
and your name was mentioned.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.610
I was wondering if you could
tell me where you were.

15:16.645 --> 15:18.612
Sure. I went to the fights
over at Harry's Gym.

15:18.647 --> 15:19.613
Mm-hmm.

15:19.648 --> 15:21.648
You go alone?

15:21.684 --> 15:23.884
No. Takata, Chambers,
Decker, we all went.

15:32.127 --> 15:33.593
You have anything to drink?

15:34.930 --> 15:36.697
Yeah, we had a few drinks.

15:36.732 --> 15:38.131
How many?

15:38.167 --> 15:39.700
I don't remember.

15:39.735 --> 15:40.834
What's in the bag?

15:40.869 --> 15:41.835
Why?

15:41.870 --> 15:43.403
I don't know. You put it on the table.

15:43.439 --> 15:44.821
It m-must mean something.

15:52.648 --> 15:54.715
Decker, take her place.

16:05.127 --> 16:06.727
Was Ms. Lopez telling the truth?

16:06.762 --> 16:07.928
Were you out last night?

16:07.963 --> 16:09.029
Yeah.

16:09.064 --> 16:11.565
And were the four of you
out together all night?

16:15.003 --> 16:17.537
Don't look at them. Look at me.

16:17.573 --> 16:21.249
Were the four of you together
all night watching the fight?

16:21.964 --> 16:23.176
No.

16:23.212 --> 16:24.978
Uh, Lopez and Takata left early.

16:25.013 --> 16:26.413
Chambers was still there when I left,

16:26.448 --> 16:29.716
which was right before the last fight.

16:29.752 --> 16:31.952
[Bag unzips]

16:33.522 --> 16:35.817
Do you know what a PED is?

16:36.399 --> 16:38.792
Yeah. It's a performance enhancing drug.

16:48.618 --> 16:51.571
Chambers, take Decker's place.

16:55.277 --> 16:56.810
- Chambers!
- Chambers!

16:58.347 --> 17:00.247
Where you running to, recruit?

17:01.817 --> 17:03.083
You don't want to miss the
rest of the Captain's lecture,

17:03.118 --> 17:04.084
do you?

17:04.118 --> 17:05.218
Turn over. [Grunts]

17:08.580 --> 17:10.580
- Ready to earn some extra credit?
- I want a lawyer.

17:10.616 --> 17:12.358
Yeah, well, you better get a good one.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.303
[Folder thuds] Juries
don't like cop killers.

17:14.594 --> 17:16.019
Wait. You think I popped Bardot?

17:16.055 --> 17:18.959
We found a stack of identical cards
in your dorm room desk.

17:19.065 --> 17:20.523
- Lawyer.
- You sent that to Bardot

17:20.559 --> 17:22.229
because he found out that
you were dealing drugs.

17:22.321 --> 17:23.420
Lawyer!

17:23.551 --> 17:24.560
Fine.

17:25.964 --> 17:27.063
You want in on a bet?

17:27.098 --> 17:28.031
On what?

17:28.066 --> 17:28.999
On you.

17:29.034 --> 17:30.400
You're not cooperating,

17:30.435 --> 17:32.235
so I'm taking protective
custody off the table,

17:32.271 --> 17:33.303
and a bunch of us are wagering

17:33.338 --> 17:34.437
on how long you're gonna last

17:34.473 --> 17:36.106
once the inmates find
out that you're a cop.

17:36.141 --> 17:37.607
I'm guessing under 12 hours,

17:37.643 --> 17:39.224
and I'm feeling real lucky right now.

17:40.679 --> 17:42.178
Wait.

17:42.214 --> 17:43.113
Can I make a deal?

17:43.148 --> 17:44.080
Depends.

17:44.116 --> 17:45.148
Start talking.

17:45.183 --> 17:46.583
Look, the fights, they didn't let out

17:46.618 --> 17:47.851
until after Bardot was murdered.

17:47.886 --> 17:49.185
Witnesses can verify I was there.

17:49.221 --> 17:50.582
So why did you threaten him?

17:51.923 --> 17:54.391
Bardot caught me with my stash
the morning he was killed.

17:54.426 --> 17:55.392
I sent the note

17:55.427 --> 17:56.793
hoping to keep him from ratting me out,

17:56.828 --> 17:59.129
only Bardot wasn't intimidated.

17:59.164 --> 18:01.698
But he offered a deal...
Five grand for his silence.

18:01.733 --> 18:04.200
Apparently he was desperate for cash,
so I paid up.

18:04.236 --> 18:05.468
He flagged a cab to the city.

18:05.504 --> 18:07.370
And why did he need
the money so urgently?

18:07.406 --> 18:08.505
Beats me.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.340
Nah, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.008
I don't know!

18:12.044 --> 18:13.877
But if anyone does,
it'd be his girlfriend.

18:13.912 --> 18:16.212
Okay. Does this girlfriend have a name?

18:17.649 --> 18:19.357
Recruit Officer Decker.

18:21.186 --> 18:23.520
[Grunting]

[Panting]

18:27.326 --> 18:29.459
[Grunting]

18:33.332 --> 18:35.565
I used to come here between classes,
too.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.334
I always enjoyed the extra practice.

18:37.369 --> 18:41.104
Except,
a mannequin doesn't resist arrest.

18:41.139 --> 18:42.205
I got it, Captain. Thanks.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.165
Show me.

18:58.651 --> 19:00.223
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Captain, okay, I got it.

19:00.258 --> 19:01.324
Shut up and listen, recruit.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.492
You might actually learn something.

19:02.527 --> 19:03.960
Come on. Turn around.

19:03.995 --> 19:05.161
[Sighs]

19:05.197 --> 19:06.830
Now, the fact that you're
a woman is an advantage,

19:06.865 --> 19:07.997
especially over men.

19:08.033 --> 19:12.135
We have a lower center of gravity,
so use it.

19:12.170 --> 19:13.803
Drop into your hips

19:13.839 --> 19:15.238
and then pull him past
the tipping point.

19:15.273 --> 19:17.271
Got it? Okay.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.781
Once the chest goes through,
the rest will follow.

19:24.816 --> 19:25.648
Try it?

19:26.752 --> 19:28.651
All right.

19:35.794 --> 19:36.993
[Grunts]

19:38.373 --> 19:40.897
Good. You're a quick study.

19:41.177 --> 19:43.633
Thanks, Captain.

19:43.668 --> 19:44.801
Esposito: We got the murder weapon.

19:44.836 --> 19:46.736
A dumpster diver found it
buried in a bag of garbage.

19:46.772 --> 19:49.239
The gun was wiped clean,
but not the rounds in the magazine.

19:49.274 --> 19:50.240
Check this out.

19:50.275 --> 19:51.775
The prints are a match to Bardot's.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.176
If Bardot loaded it,

19:53.211 --> 19:55.178
then he had to have been the one
who stole it from the Academy.

19:55.213 --> 19:56.746
So he was shot with his own gun?

19:56.782 --> 19:57.981
Question is,

19:58.016 --> 19:59.783
what was he doing with it
out there in the first place?

19:59.818 --> 20:01.384
The Academy is a stressful place.

20:01.420 --> 20:02.452
Plenty of pressures here.

20:02.487 --> 20:03.853
Especially since one mistake

20:03.889 --> 20:07.009
can put a stink on an entire cop career.

20:07.261 --> 20:09.025
Like, uh, getting caught

20:09.060 --> 20:11.004
fraternizing with another recruit.

20:15.066 --> 20:17.033

20:25.277 --> 20:27.577
Are you gonna have me booted?

[Breathes deeply]

20:30.015 --> 20:30.980
No.

20:34.719 --> 20:38.721
But I-I need you to be on the
up-and-up with me from now on.

20:38.757 --> 20:40.523
Of course.

20:40.559 --> 20:42.625
Anything you want to know.

20:44.062 --> 20:46.963
Officer Bardot leveraged
Chambers for five grand.

20:46.998 --> 20:50.133
Apparently he needed
that money urgently.

20:50.168 --> 20:51.494
Do you know why?

20:53.371 --> 20:54.708
No. No clue.

20:55.607 --> 20:56.739
I swear.

20:59.444 --> 21:02.412
Look, the truth is,
Danny was hiding something from me.

21:02.447 --> 21:04.280
He'd been going out at
night the last few nights,

21:04.338 --> 21:05.482
which was really unlike him.

21:05.517 --> 21:06.683
He'd slip into my room late.

21:06.718 --> 21:08.251
Said he'd been out for a midnight jog,

21:08.286 --> 21:10.353
but, I mean, I knew that was total BS

21:10.388 --> 21:11.721
because when he came in,

21:11.756 --> 21:13.790
he wasn't tired, he wasn't sweaty.

21:13.825 --> 21:15.458
Just always smelled like rotten fish.

21:15.494 --> 21:16.559
Really?

21:16.595 --> 21:18.328
Yeah. It was weird.
I asked him about it.

21:18.363 --> 21:20.263
He said he accidently stepped
in garbage on his run.

21:20.298 --> 21:22.398
But if that was the case, then...

21:22.434 --> 21:25.001
Why did he smell like
rotten fish every night?

21:25.036 --> 21:26.102
[Elevator dings]

21:26.137 --> 21:27.837
- Sweet and pungent shrimp?
- Where from?

21:27.873 --> 21:29.205
Chinatown, across the street

21:29.241 --> 21:30.807
from the back-alley computer repair shop

21:30.842 --> 21:32.041
where Bardot was dropped

21:32.077 --> 21:33.810
with five grand burning
a hole in his pocket.

21:33.879 --> 21:35.011
What was he doing there?

21:35.046 --> 21:36.679
Owner refused to talk when
I showed her his photo.

21:36.715 --> 21:38.248
So I looked into her.

21:38.283 --> 21:39.549
Word is she deals

21:39.584 --> 21:43.753
in black market software and hardware.

21:43.788 --> 21:45.321
Bardot may have bought
something from her.

21:45.357 --> 21:46.289
I wonder why.

21:46.324 --> 21:47.891
Let's get Bardot's laptop to Vikram,

21:47.926 --> 21:49.292
have him run a deeper search.

21:49.327 --> 21:50.793
- All right.
- Esposito: Yo!

21:50.829 --> 21:53.229
Decker's tip on Bardot's shoes paid off.

21:53.265 --> 21:54.230
The lab identified

21:54.266 --> 21:56.065
wild Scottish salmon
scales on the soles.

21:56.101 --> 21:57.800
And only three fish markets
import wild Scottish salmon.

21:57.836 --> 22:00.737
That's the same neighborhood
as the crime scene.

22:00.772 --> 22:02.805
And apparently,
Bardot went there on consecutive nights.

22:02.841 --> 22:04.607
We'll canvass the fish market,

22:04.643 --> 22:05.675
see if we can figure
out what he was up to.

22:05.710 --> 22:07.043
Okay.

22:08.914 --> 22:10.847
[Knock on door]

22:20.592 --> 22:21.990
You were right.

22:22.861 --> 22:26.329
I uncovered the real reason
I had my memories erased,

22:26.364 --> 22:28.343
and it's bad.

22:30.335 --> 22:33.026
I knew about LokSat a
year and a half ago...

22:33.277 --> 22:34.971
before your A.G. team was murdered,

22:35.006 --> 22:37.106
before Vikram sought you out

22:37.142 --> 22:39.876
and the hit squads came gunning.

22:39.945 --> 22:42.512
Beckett,
this was on me before it was on you.

22:42.547 --> 22:44.547
You knew about LokSat?

22:45.164 --> 22:47.350
Everything?

22:47.385 --> 22:49.265
Including their connection to Bracken?

22:50.088 --> 22:51.487
And you chose to forget this?

22:51.523 --> 22:52.911
Why?

22:54.059 --> 22:56.392
For reasons you know all to well.

22:56.428 --> 22:58.361
I was trying to protect you.

22:58.396 --> 22:59.729
From who?

23:06.338 --> 23:07.870
Uh, we found something you need to see.

I'll be right there.

23:11.610 --> 23:13.109

23:13.144 --> 23:15.381
I need time to process this.

23:17.182 --> 23:18.615
[Door opens]

23:18.650 --> 23:19.749
What is it?

23:19.784 --> 23:20.783
Ryan: Well,
we found street-cam footage of Bardot

23:20.819 --> 23:22.151
before he was killed.

23:22.187 --> 23:24.921
This is Bardot an hour
before he was murdered

23:24.956 --> 23:26.990
walking past the fish market,

23:27.025 --> 23:30.293
which is right across the alley
from a lingerie wholesaler.

23:30.328 --> 23:33.596
It is a known front for Jack Flanagan,

23:33.632 --> 23:35.198
A.K.A. Lucky Jack.

23:35.233 --> 23:37.567
He's the Mafia boss
who runs Hunts Point.

23:37.602 --> 23:39.135
Bardot grew up in Hunts Point.

23:39.170 --> 23:40.169
Esposito: Check this out.

23:40.205 --> 23:41.971
The law firm that Bardot contacted,

23:42.007 --> 23:43.640
they represent Jack Flanagan.

23:43.675 --> 23:44.707
Bardot was communicating

23:44.743 --> 23:46.275
to Flanagan through a third party

23:46.311 --> 23:47.377
so it couldn't be traced.

23:47.412 --> 23:48.745
And it gets better. Show her.

23:48.780 --> 23:53.082
Our victim was in league
with the Irish Mafia.

23:53.118 --> 23:56.619
Flanagan must have planted
Bardot in the NYPD as his mole.

23:56.655 --> 23:58.888
For all we know,
he's been grooming Bardot

23:58.923 --> 24:00.423
since he was a kid in
the old neighborhood.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.525
What I don't get is if Bardot
was working for Flanagan,

24:02.560 --> 24:05.395
why did Bardot bring
a gun to the meeting?

24:05.430 --> 24:06.629
Protection.

24:06.665 --> 24:08.364
Ortiz said that Bardot

24:08.400 --> 24:10.199
was looking ' to set something right.

24:10.235 --> 24:13.336
He had second thoughts about
being a mole for Flanagan.

24:13.371 --> 24:15.612
And then Flanagan killed him for it.

24:17.765 --> 24:19.263
Castle: <i>I was trying to protect you.</i>

24:19.356 --> 24:21.000
Beckett: <i> From who?</i>

24:21.417 --> 24:22.534
<i>From yourself.</i>

24:22.569 --> 24:24.169
Ryan: Bardot's computer.

24:24.204 --> 24:26.004
Vikram found a hidden folder

24:26.040 --> 24:29.007
that contains every NYPD file
of Flanagan and his crew.

24:29.043 --> 24:31.343
Surveillance photos, wire taps, C.I.s...

24:31.378 --> 24:32.611
Everything that Flanagan would need

24:32.646 --> 24:33.945
to stay one step ahead of the police.

24:33.981 --> 24:36.315
But how did Bardot hack into
the NYPD's secure network?

24:36.350 --> 24:38.417
It's hardwired into select
department computers.

24:38.452 --> 24:39.584
Including the computer

24:39.620 --> 24:41.653
in Commissioner Malone's
office at the Academy.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.722
Bardot must have snuck
into Malone's office,

24:43.791 --> 24:46.358
used a portable password cracker on it.

24:47.428 --> 24:48.894
That's what he got at the black market

24:48.929 --> 24:50.862
with the five grand he
squeezed out of Chambers.

24:50.898 --> 24:52.798
Flanagan used Bardot to get these files.

24:52.833 --> 24:55.167
After he got them,
he turned on his own mole.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.601
Bardot must have seen
the double-cross coming.

24:56.637 --> 24:58.236
He pulled his gun, they fought,

24:58.272 --> 24:59.705
Flanagan got the upper hand,

24:59.740 --> 25:01.373
then he shot Bardot in the back.

25:01.408 --> 25:02.941
All right. Let's dig into Flanagan.

25:02.976 --> 25:04.343
See if we can corroborate this.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.178
- You want us to pick him up?
- Nope. Not yet.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.946
I'm gonna have a
sit-down with Lucky Jack,

25:07.981 --> 25:09.537
see if I can rattle his cage.

25:10.767 --> 25:12.551
So you deny that Bardot supplied you

25:12.586 --> 25:14.186
with confidential NYPD files?

25:14.221 --> 25:15.620
Absolutely, with prejudice.

25:15.656 --> 25:17.189
That kid came in here

25:17.224 --> 25:19.628
looking for a job as
a lingerie salesman.

25:19.734 --> 25:21.427
Bardot was working for you...

25:22.262 --> 25:24.496
and I'm gonna prove that you killed him.

25:24.531 --> 25:25.764

25:27.102 --> 25:30.166
20 years you guys have
been coming in here

25:31.004 --> 25:34.072
with all these accusations against ol'
Lucky Jack.

25:34.108 --> 25:35.741
Your problem is that none of you

25:35.776 --> 25:37.776
ever follow it up with the proof.

So, unless you're here

See, that's how I know
I'm gonna take you down.

25:51.792 --> 25:54.259
It's the cocky ones
that are the easiest.

25:54.294 --> 25:56.027
You're so busy being clever,

25:56.063 --> 25:58.964
you don't see the matchstick
falling out of your pocket.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.266
Well, I'm gonna find that matchstick,

26:01.301 --> 26:03.368
and then I'm gonna burn you with it.

26:40.574 --> 26:41.840
Or throw around blame.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.619
[Liquid pours]

26:43.910 --> 26:45.410
You know, the novelist George Sand...

26:45.446 --> 26:47.112
Who was a woman, by the way...

26:47.147 --> 26:49.314
Once wrote "Lying,
like license, has its... "

26:49.349 --> 26:51.397
Castle, can you do me a favor?

26:52.957 --> 26:54.453
Anything.

26:54.488 --> 26:55.620
Stop talking.

27:03.597 --> 27:05.530
[Exhales]

27:06.815 --> 27:10.559
So, if we're not talking,
what are we doing?

27:14.308 --> 27:17.209
[Liquid pours]

27:36.096 --> 27:38.096
Esposito: Captain.

27:38.131 --> 27:40.632
Captain,
looks like Jack Flanagan's reach

27:40.667 --> 27:42.801
goes deeper inside the
Academy than just Bardot.

27:43.804 --> 27:45.103
What are you talking about?

27:45.138 --> 27:47.405
Well, one of the recruits went
to college on a scholarship

27:47.441 --> 27:50.509
awarded by a trust created
by Flanagan's law firm.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.945
Now, that scholarship was
financed by Flanagan himself.

27:53.981 --> 27:56.915
So Flanagan has a second
mole in the police academy?

27:56.950 --> 27:57.983
Who?

27:58.018 --> 28:00.485
I am not his mole, okay?
Neither was Danny!

28:00.521 --> 28:01.920
We found the police files that he hacked

28:01.955 --> 28:03.754
and then handed over to Flanagan.

28:04.177 --> 28:06.024
Oh, no.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.526
No, no, no.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.661
Danny must have made a
deal in order to save me.

28:09.696 --> 28:11.216
Save you from what?

28:11.965 --> 28:14.499
The man that knocked up my mother.

28:17.724 --> 28:19.471
You're Flanagan's daughter.

28:19.506 --> 28:21.673
A one-night stand does
not make him a parent.

28:21.708 --> 28:22.707
It makes him a donor.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.276
You took his blood money.

28:24.311 --> 28:25.911
He and my mother had an arrangement...

28:25.946 --> 28:27.579
Staying quiet on my paternity

28:27.614 --> 28:29.180
in exchange for monthly payouts to her

28:29.216 --> 28:30.282
and a college fund for me.

28:30.317 --> 28:31.349
But that was it.

28:31.385 --> 28:33.618
Then why did Bardot need to save you?

28:33.654 --> 28:34.719
A few weeks ago,

28:34.755 --> 28:37.122
Flanagan found out that
I joined the Academy.

28:37.157 --> 28:40.158
He demanded that I be his
inside woman... his mole.

28:40.193 --> 28:42.160
Threatened to "out"
me as his daughter if I didn't.

28:42.195 --> 28:44.996
Ruin my entire career
before it even began.

28:45.032 --> 28:47.832
'Cause no cop will ever
trust Lucky Jack's kid.

28:47.868 --> 28:49.668
I panicked.

28:49.703 --> 28:52.304
I ended up opening up to Danny.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.439
He was the one that
talked me off the ledge,

28:54.474 --> 28:57.290
told me that Flanagan was bluffing.

28:58.045 --> 28:59.544
I had no idea that he was

28:59.580 --> 29:01.813
gonna offer himself up in my place.

29:01.848 --> 29:03.415
[Sighs]

29:04.447 --> 29:06.563
What do I do, Captain?

29:11.725 --> 29:14.059
[Chair scrapes lightly]

29:18.612 --> 29:21.667
There is only one move
that you can make.

29:23.215 --> 29:25.570
Do you want to arrest Bardot's killer?

29:25.606 --> 29:27.105
Bring down Flanagan...

29:27.140 --> 29:30.275
Something the NYPD
hasn't done for 20 years?

29:32.492 --> 29:35.780
You're the one person
Flanagan might open up to.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.519
You need to wear a wire.

29:49.136 --> 29:52.263
All right, you get into trouble,
what are you gonna say?

29:53.800 --> 29:55.700
- Decker.
- What?

29:55.736 --> 29:56.668
Panic phrase.

29:56.703 --> 29:58.169
Oh, um...

29:58.205 --> 29:59.437
"I could really use a drink right now.

29:59.473 --> 30:00.572
- Do you have any Scotch?"
- Exactly.

30:00.607 --> 30:02.065
You say that, we're gonna rush in.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.909
You're gonna be fine.

30:04.945 --> 30:06.519
Okay.

30:06.969 --> 30:08.371
Okay.

30:10.917 --> 30:13.084
You really think she's ready for this,
Captain?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.753
Not everybody's as strong as you.

30:14.788 --> 30:16.554
I'd be damned if Flanagan makes her.

30:16.623 --> 30:18.456
He won't hesitate to put
a bullet in her skull.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.426
She can handle this.

30:36.109 --> 30:38.610
Come on. Come on. You got it.

it didn't have to play out this way.</i>

<i>I'm not afraid of you anymore.</i>

31:34.968 --> 31:36.267
Where the hell did she get a gun?

Now admit to killing Danny,
or I will end you.

31:40.253 --> 31:42.122

with your boyfriend's murder.

own up to what you did!

- Police!

31:51.974 --> 31:55.717
You can take him down,
just not like this.

31:55.832 --> 31:56.765
You are not him.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.333
Put the gun down.

31:58.368 --> 31:59.968
As soon as you start telling the truth.

32:00.003 --> 32:01.102
Come on, Captain. Do something.

32:01.138 --> 32:02.754
Flanagan, start talking!

32:06.176 --> 32:08.410
Okay. [Chuckles nervously]

32:08.445 --> 32:11.880
Your boyfriend, uh,
has a set of balls on him.

32:11.915 --> 32:15.250
I mean, he marches in here
and tells me to back down.

32:15.285 --> 32:16.651
And you know what I do?

32:16.687 --> 32:18.653
I say, "Sure, but you got to
do a little something for me."

32:18.689 --> 32:19.988
Okay?

32:20.023 --> 32:24.192
Now, your boy comes through,
we shake hands, and that's it.

32:25.796 --> 32:27.287
Then who killed him?

32:27.931 --> 32:29.431
I don't know who killed him.

32:29.466 --> 32:31.099
Did he mention having
problems with anyone?

32:31.134 --> 32:33.735
No. No, no. Look, um...

32:33.770 --> 32:35.470
When he left,
this car started down the street.

32:35.505 --> 32:36.842
Now, for a minute,

32:36.895 --> 32:38.907
I thought maybe he was being tailed.

32:38.942 --> 32:40.308
It was a... a dark Sedan.

32:40.344 --> 32:42.911
Now, that's it. That's it. I swear.

32:43.857 --> 32:45.365
What do you think?

32:46.225 --> 32:47.786
He's telling the truth.

32:50.643 --> 32:52.520
Stand down.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.461
Hayley: You are a hot mess.

33:33.497 --> 33:36.898
I take it that your talk with
Beckett last night went well?

33:36.933 --> 33:40.769
Less of a discussion,
more of an Irish intervention.

33:40.804 --> 33:42.604
So you just sat around drinking whiskey

33:42.639 --> 33:43.738
and avoiding the subject.

33:43.774 --> 33:46.274
Yes. But I can tell she's
still upset with me.

33:46.310 --> 33:48.243
She left this morning without waking me.

33:48.278 --> 33:52.280
So,
what do you plan on doing about that?

33:53.617 --> 33:54.475
Nothing.

33:54.554 --> 33:57.619
Well, that has to be the stupidest
thing I've heard all day.

33:57.654 --> 33:59.421
I am holding onto the thin hope

33:59.456 --> 34:01.723
that Beckett can find it
in her heart to forgive me.

34:01.758 --> 34:03.725
Rick, come on. Stop moping about.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.427
Go do something about it.

34:05.462 --> 34:06.661
What? Have Beckett's memory wiped?

34:06.697 --> 34:07.796
No.

34:07.831 --> 34:09.438
We track down LokSat.

34:10.233 --> 34:11.833
Our west-coast adventure yielded fruit.

34:11.868 --> 34:14.002
We have a window of time in
which LokSat arrived in L.A.

34:14.036 --> 34:15.969
If we scrub the identities
of everyone who landed

34:16.005 --> 34:17.672
in any area airport
via public or private,

34:17.708 --> 34:19.407
then sooner or later
we'll find our target.

34:19.443 --> 34:21.315
I can start now. Say the word.

34:22.212 --> 34:23.911
I'm not making any more decisions

34:23.947 --> 34:26.147
concerning LokSat without Beckett.

34:26.647 --> 34:29.184
Now that is the smartest
thing I've heard all day!

34:29.219 --> 34:30.418
Ohh. [Gasps]

34:30.454 --> 34:31.585
[Groans] I'm so sorry.

34:31.621 --> 34:33.487
Okay, I'll get you more aspirin.

34:33.523 --> 34:34.456
Beckett: You are not quitting.

34:34.491 --> 34:36.725
I'm unfit to be a cop, Captain.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.460
If you hadn't talked
me down back there...

34:40.208 --> 34:41.929
I had every intention
of pulling that trigger.

34:41.965 --> 34:43.630
But you didn't.

34:43.667 --> 34:46.034
You regained your wits,
you made the right decision,

34:46.069 --> 34:47.668
and that's what counts.

34:47.704 --> 34:50.138
There was a point in my
career where I wanted to quit.

34:50.172 --> 34:53.235
I lost faith that I became
a cop for the right reason.

34:55.245 --> 34:56.672
How'd you get your faith back?

34:56.777 --> 34:58.380
A man named Roy Montgomery helped me.

34:58.415 --> 34:59.647
He was my Captain.

34:59.683 --> 35:03.151
He didn't give up on me,
and I am not giving up on you.

35:03.186 --> 35:05.620
So don't let your father
define who you are.

35:05.655 --> 35:08.757
I have been trying to
outrun him my entire life.

35:08.792 --> 35:10.225
I'm tired of running.

35:10.260 --> 35:14.162
I'm gonna head back to the Academy,
clean out my room.

It's always disappointing.

35:31.014 --> 35:32.147
It happens.

35:32.182 --> 35:35.116
No, not to recruits like her.

Can't make out the driver, though.

35:46.196 --> 35:48.196
But you can make out the plate.

35:48.231 --> 35:49.264
Who's this registered to?

35:49.299 --> 35:50.498
It's one of ours.

35:50.534 --> 35:52.667
Issued to the Police Academy Motor Pool.

35:52.702 --> 35:53.768
Oh, come on, Beckett.

35:53.804 --> 35:55.603
Just because she's got good scores

35:55.639 --> 35:57.539
doesn't mean she'll make a good cop.

35:57.574 --> 35:58.606
I'd put her on the street

36:09.653 --> 36:12.420
Okay. Who's the car registered to?

36:21.932 --> 36:24.742
Yeah. Thanks for the update.

36:28.638 --> 36:30.267
Everything all right?

36:31.174 --> 36:32.941
Put your weapon down. Now.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.775
Have you lost your damn mind, Beckett?
What are you doing?

36:36.819 --> 36:39.172
Damn it, Ortiz, don't make this
harder than it needs to be!

36:39.220 --> 36:40.152
I know what you did.

36:40.187 --> 36:41.720
Wait, you think I killed Bardot?

36:41.789 --> 36:43.956
You suspected that Bardot
was working for Flanagan,

36:43.991 --> 36:45.257
so you followed him.

36:45.293 --> 36:47.893
And then when you found out he
was a mole, you took him out.

36:47.928 --> 36:49.395

Bardot over to I.A.?

and a mountain of debt!

37:37.244 --> 37:38.672
I took what I was owed.

37:38.818 --> 37:40.412
It doesn't have to end like this.

37:40.448 --> 37:41.814
Actually, it does.

37:41.849 --> 37:43.849
[Light switches click]

37:46.815 --> 37:48.746
[Whispering] I'm gonna draw him away.

37:50.658 --> 37:52.057
[Computer beeping]

37:52.093 --> 37:53.325
[Normal voice] Just give up, Malone.

37:53.361 --> 37:55.594
My detectives are onto you.

37:55.629 --> 37:58.397
[Whirring]

37:58.432 --> 38:01.333
Malone: No, they're onto Ortiz.

38:03.104 --> 38:05.571
[Glass shattering]

38:05.606 --> 38:07.706
[Hydraulics hiss]

38:07.742 --> 38:09.608
[Gunshots]

38:09.643 --> 38:10.776
[Hydraulics whirring, hissing]

38:10.811 --> 38:12.010
Damn it.

38:12.046 --> 38:13.612
[Air hisses]

38:19.038 --> 38:21.326
Beckett: So,
what are you gonna do, Malone?

38:21.445 --> 38:24.038
Kill me and stage it like Ortiz did it?

38:24.158 --> 38:26.124
Say you shot him in self-defense?

38:26.160 --> 38:27.759
[Whirring, hissing continues]

38:27.795 --> 38:29.060
Good plan, huh?

38:29.096 --> 38:31.463
Probably give me a medal.

38:31.498 --> 38:33.765
[Gunshot]

38:33.801 --> 38:35.400
Aah!

38:37.571 --> 38:39.471
[Whirring, hissing]

38:47.381 --> 38:49.080
Peek-a-boo. [Grunts]

38:53.554 --> 38:55.620
[Malone grunts, body thuds]

38:55.656 --> 38:57.556
[Siren chirps]

39:01.328 --> 39:04.462
Sarge,
I thought we finally got rid of you.

39:04.498 --> 39:05.897
Oh, it's gonna take more than a bullet

39:05.933 --> 39:07.699
to put me down for the long dirt nap.

39:07.734 --> 39:09.367
Esposito: Well, you best heal up quick.

39:09.403 --> 39:10.869
Got a new batch of recruits
coming in a few weeks.

39:10.904 --> 39:12.137
Ryan: All right, Sarge.

39:12.206 --> 39:13.104
We'll get you out of here.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.840
Medic. Thanks.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.308
Yeah.

39:25.152 --> 39:26.885
Beckett: Hey, how you holding up?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.220
Well, we caught Danny's killer,

39:28.255 --> 39:29.955
but Lucky Jack Flanagan's still free.

39:29.990 --> 39:33.021
Yeah, well, his time will come.

39:33.497 --> 39:35.627
Stay with the NYPD,
and you can help with that.

39:39.212 --> 39:41.600
But you can't do this
if you go it alone.

39:44.856 --> 39:47.713
Do you want to be a cop or not?

39:51.078 --> 39:52.611
Yes.

39:57.951 --> 39:59.451
[Knock on door]

40:00.367 --> 40:02.320
I can't do this anymore. [Sighs]

40:02.356 --> 40:03.688
Good. Neither can I.

40:03.724 --> 40:05.190
Wait, what are you talking about?

40:05.225 --> 40:06.892
What are <i> you</i> talking about?

40:06.927 --> 40:08.193
- I asked first.
- And I asked second.

40:08.228 --> 40:09.628
So you should answer first,
and I'll answer second.

40:09.663 --> 40:10.896
- Castle.
- O-Okay.

40:10.931 --> 40:13.431
[Inhales deeply] I can't
sit on the sidelines anymore

40:13.467 --> 40:14.633
where LokSat is concerned.

40:14.668 --> 40:16.401
I... People have lost their lives.

40:16.436 --> 40:17.802
And in a way, I am culpable.

40:17.838 --> 40:19.604
And I know you are trying to protect me,

40:19.640 --> 40:21.473
but I'm begging you not to.

40:21.508 --> 40:22.474
I want in.

40:22.509 --> 40:24.242
Good, because I need you in.

40:25.812 --> 40:27.345
This is our fight now.

40:28.347 --> 40:29.789
[Exhales deeply] Okay.

40:32.085 --> 40:34.273
Okay,
then there's something you should know.

40:35.096 --> 40:38.290
That mystery bullet wound
I got when I disappeared?

40:38.325 --> 40:40.992
I was shot in Los Angeles.

40:41.028 --> 40:42.794
Two hours before I took that bullet,

40:42.829 --> 40:44.529
LokSat came to town, arriving by plane.

40:44.564 --> 40:46.264
Uh, okay.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.166
There are three major airports

40:48.201 --> 40:49.968
along with dozens of private ones

40:50.003 --> 40:51.236
in the Los Angeles area.

40:51.271 --> 40:53.680
We're talking tens of
thousands of people.

40:54.712 --> 40:56.775
But maybe Vikram can
whittle that number down.

40:56.810 --> 40:58.977
We're looking for a needle
in a stack of needles,

40:59.012 --> 41:01.479
but LokSat is one of those needles.

41:01.515 --> 41:03.181
What do you say, Beckett?

41:03.216 --> 41:04.449
It's a place to start.

41:04.484 --> 41:05.265
No.

41:05.398 --> 41:06.681
This is.
