00:27.800 --> 00:32.880
<b>The King transformed his <i>En</i> 
into countless particles,</b>

00:32.880 --> 00:34.680
<b>and scattered them everywhere.</b>

01:09.910 --> 01:13.010
<b>If there are conditions I must meet 
for you to turn over Komugi,</b>

01:13.920 --> 01:14.940
<b>speak.</b>

01:25.980 --> 01:30.980
<b>This Person x And x This Moment</b>

01:35.750 --> 01:38.490
<b>It appears that only one of you is here,</b>

01:39.340 --> 01:42.010
<b>but I shall address this 
message to both of you.</b>

01:45.750 --> 01:48.190
<b><i>He knows exactly what we're doing.</i></b>

01:48.190 --> 01:49.750
<b><i>We won't be able to trick him.</i></b>

01:50.580 --> 01:54.770
<b>What I felt after coming into 
contact with your <i>Nen</i></b>

01:55.460 --> 01:59.180
<b>was not anger, fear, or hatred.</b>

01:59.180 --> 02:02.010
<b>Only senses of duty and resolve.</b>

02:02.910 --> 02:07.770
<b>If you are fighting for the survival 
of humanity, your battle is over.</b>

02:09.650 --> 02:11.410
<b>You need further explanation?</b>

02:11.860 --> 02:14.030
<b>It seems you doubt what you've just heard.</b>

02:14.580 --> 02:16.280
<b>Then I shall repeat myself.</b>

02:16.990 --> 02:20.280
<b>You have won... The battle is over.</b>

02:24.350 --> 02:27.540
<b>The rest of what I have to 
say is for your ears only.</b>

02:28.780 --> 02:31.770
<b>The reason I am here is quite simple.</b>

02:32.300 --> 02:33.540
<b>I have one motive...</b>

02:34.250 --> 02:36.590
<b>I wish to see the human named Komugi.</b>

02:36.970 --> 02:38.050
<b>That is all I want.</b>

02:39.760 --> 02:43.220
<b>That is really all I want.</b>

02:45.290 --> 02:47.370
<b>I desire nothing else.</b>

02:48.480 --> 02:50.470
<b>After coming into contact with your <i>Nen</i>,</b>

02:51.010 --> 02:54.090
<b>I learned my current state and fate.</b>

02:54.710 --> 02:58.570
<b>And having learned my fate, I simply wish</b>

02:59.190 --> 03:02.770
<b>to spend my remaining time with Komugi.</b>

03:03.870 --> 03:05.130
<b>That is all I want.</b>

03:22.630 --> 03:23.590
<b>Was this...</b>

03:24.250 --> 03:29.280
<b>Was this a plan you devised after 
discovering my personality?</b>

03:30.220 --> 03:32.410
<b><i>No, I already know the answer...</i></b>

03:32.410 --> 03:33.350
<b><i>It's impossible.</i></b>

03:33.700 --> 03:35.870
<b>You expect me to believe you?</b>

03:35.870 --> 03:38.730
<b>You think I'll just accept that explanation?!</b>

03:39.470 --> 03:43.820
<b><i>An omnipotent King would 
never lie to himself in order</i></b>

03:43.820 --> 03:45.870
<b><i>to fool a lower being like me!</i></b>

03:46.220 --> 03:50.210
<b>After all the killing you have done, 
and soon will do...</b>

03:50.210 --> 03:51.870
<b>A creature like you...</b>

03:52.310 --> 03:55.380
<b><i>The King admits defeat? Cares for a human?</i></b>

03:55.850 --> 03:58.380
<b>Impossible! That's impossible!</b>

03:59.530 --> 04:02.010
<b><i>He's doing this because it is the truth!</i></b>

04:03.190 --> 04:06.790
<b>I believe it was only a slight change...</b>

04:07.140 --> 04:07.960
<b>Huh?</b>

04:09.140 --> 04:16.020
<b>Something, somewhere, changed ever so slightly.</b>

04:16.800 --> 04:20.620
<b>In my current state, I am not a god,</b>

04:21.400 --> 04:22.530
<b>but I...</b>

04:23.400 --> 04:24.530
<b>No...</b>

04:24.960 --> 04:30.900
<b>Perhaps, I only feel this way 
because everything has fallen into place.</b>

04:32.180 --> 04:34.800
<b>You should know I have very little time.</b>

04:35.190 --> 04:37.110
<b>I want you to tell me her location,</b>

04:37.110 --> 04:38.920
<b>so I do not have to search for her.</b>

04:39.240 --> 04:40.880
<b>What are you saying?!</b>

04:40.880 --> 04:41.920
<b><i>Stop this...</i></b>

04:42.300 --> 04:45.900
<b>Yes, I know where she is!</b>

04:45.900 --> 04:48.450
<b>Why don't you just torture it out of me?</b>

04:48.450 --> 04:49.930
<b><i>I know the answer.</i></b>

04:50.560 --> 04:54.940
<b>We both know that isn't an option.</b>

04:55.750 --> 05:00.940
<b>Your aura is as strong and beautiful 
as any I have ever beheld.</b>

05:01.430 --> 05:02.810
<b><i>Stop this!</i></b>

05:04.050 --> 05:08.200
<b>All I can do is to ask you to help me.</b>

05:19.680 --> 05:21.280
<b>Don't!</b>

05:27.370 --> 05:31.920
<b>I am part Ant now...</b>

05:34.130 --> 05:40.700
<b>I know very well how important 
you are to the race...</b>

05:43.550 --> 05:44.800
<b><i>Not that...</i></b>

05:46.670 --> 05:48.300
<b><i>Don't go to such lengths...</i></b>

05:52.150 --> 05:53.880
<b><i>You mustn't do that...</i></b>

05:55.320 --> 05:56.380
<b>I'll tell you.</b>

05:58.940 --> 06:02.020
<b>But on one condition.</b>

06:03.940 --> 06:06.760
<b>May I use my power</b>

06:07.680 --> 06:10.260
<b>to watch your final moments with her?</b>

06:12.540 --> 06:14.770
<b>If that is what it takes to be with Komugi,</b>

06:16.050 --> 06:17.550
<b>you certainly may.</b>

06:24.970 --> 06:27.400
<b><i>Sorry, Killua...</i></b>

06:28.050 --> 06:29.360
<b><i>I couldn't</i></b>

06:30.150 --> 06:31.760
<b><i>keep our promise...</i></b>

07:22.550 --> 07:25.760
<b>4-7-1, marshal...</b>

07:34.460 --> 07:35.770
<b>Wake up, Komugi.</b>

07:36.550 --> 07:37.610
<b>It's time to play.</b>

07:49.520 --> 07:52.030
<b><i>We have a shocking news update.</i></b>

07:52.540 --> 07:54.360
<b><i>The true purpose of the summoning</i></b>

07:54.360 --> 07:59.100
<b><i>of all Republic of East Gorteau 
citizens to the capital city</i></b>

07:59.100 --> 08:01.770
<b><i>was a plot by the Supreme 
Leader to massacre them.</i></b>

08:02.240 --> 08:06.260
<b><i>The body of Supreme Leader Diego 
was discovered under the rubble,</i></b>

08:06.260 --> 08:09.170
<b><i>suggesting that the victims were 
likely forced into mass suicide.</i></b>

08:09.490 --> 08:14.720
<b><i>But the second-in-command, 
Secretary Bizeff, is still missing,</i></b>

08:15.290 --> 08:21.230
<b><i>so some authorities believe a 
revolution is the greater likelihood.</i></b>

08:21.750 --> 08:24.560
<b><i>Meanwhile, there has also been trouble</i></b>

08:24.560 --> 08:27.990
<b><i>in the NGL region of the Mitene Union, 
as international peacekeepers</i></b>

08:27.990 --> 08:31.650
<b><i>have sent queries regarding refugees,</i></b>

08:31.650 --> 08:33.990
<b><i>and have received no response.</i></b>

08:34.450 --> 08:36.450
<b><i>There have been rumors of</i></b>

08:36.450 --> 08:39.980
<b><i>illicit dealings between 
East Gorteau and NGL,</i></b>

08:39.980 --> 08:43.210
<b><i>and the international community 
seeks to use this incident</i></b>

08:43.210 --> 08:46.570
<b><i>as an opportunity to conduct 
a more forceful investigation.</i></b>

08:50.410 --> 08:54.590
<b>Yeah, the boss did his duty.</b>

08:55.280 --> 08:58.510
<b>No, I wasn't there to see it.</b>

08:59.330 --> 09:01.770
<b>It still isn't clear yet.</b>

09:02.870 --> 09:05.370
<b>Yeah, we're waiting on Palm.</b>

09:05.370 --> 09:07.950
<b>Can we really trust her alone</b>

09:07.950 --> 09:09.890
<b>to verify the King's death?</b>

09:09.890 --> 09:13.000
<b>Plus, that person was captured and</b>

09:13.000 --> 09:14.760
<b>converted by the enemy, yes?</b>

09:15.580 --> 09:18.830
<b>Well, that's a question of professionalism.</b>

09:18.830 --> 09:20.430
<b>It would be professional</b>

09:20.430 --> 09:23.460
<b>to provide a complete report 
in the safest manner possible.</b>

09:24.160 --> 09:27.160
<b>But those are the professionals who spend</b>

09:27.160 --> 09:29.400
<b>all of their time sitting in fully-furnished offices.</b>

09:29.780 --> 09:34.570
<b>And when we field Hunters are told 
to trust a partner, we trust them.</b>

09:35.080 --> 09:36.430
<b>We're all professionals...</b>

09:36.830 --> 09:38.260
<b>But I'm the one out in the field!</b>

09:38.260 --> 09:39.680
<b>I'm not sitting in an office!</b>

09:42.260 --> 09:46.020
<b>The Vice Chairman's faction won't 
accept that argument.</b>

09:46.020 --> 09:48.940
<b>If they find out, you can expect 
to be questioned, at the least.</b>

10:09.130 --> 10:12.920
<b><i>Uh, I am Netero...</i></b>

10:16.870 --> 10:19.650
<b><i>Chairman, thank you for a job well done.</i></b>

10:20.420 --> 10:23.290
<b><i>May you rest in peace.</i></b>

10:25.540 --> 10:30.980
<b>The same day, a video was streamed 
online in which Netero announced</b>

10:30.980 --> 10:34.660
<b>his resignation as Chairman 
of the Hunter Association,</b>

10:34.660 --> 10:37.490
<b>and gave instructions for 
choosing his successor.</b>

10:38.280 --> 10:41.670
<b>However, major news stories in the 
government-run media overshadowed it,</b>

10:41.670 --> 10:47.200
<b>and only a few realized that 
the video was his will.</b>

10:50.120 --> 10:52.580
<b>Now, let us drink.</b>

10:53.520 --> 10:55.220
<b>Let us drink.</b>

10:55.830 --> 10:57.510
<b>Drink to the human race.</b>

10:58.790 --> 11:06.310
<b>In every age, there will be good 
humans and bad humans.</b>

11:07.450 --> 11:10.250
<b>Human life is too long 
to devote to reproduction,</b>

11:10.250 --> 11:14.280
<b>yet too short to devote to learning, 
in the helix of time.</b>

11:15.990 --> 11:20.640
<b>Perhaps that is why humans succumb 
to desire and seek release.</b>

11:22.660 --> 11:30.450
<b>Despite the fact that life is complete 
with the sun, the land, and poetry.</b>

11:30.460 --> 11:33.920
<b>Supreme Leader Diego (Real) 
In his 30th year of retirement, 
on a farm, in an unnamed country</b>

11:39.820 --> 11:41.190
<b>It's over...</b>

12:01.840 --> 12:06.200
<b>But it feels like we 
haven't played in ages...</b>

12:06.530 --> 12:10.900
<b>Playing in real life is completely different 
than playing in my dreams.</b>

12:10.900 --> 12:11.770
<b>Yes.</b>

12:11.770 --> 12:16.210
<b>I thought I felt someone kick 
me hard in the stomach.</b>

12:16.210 --> 12:20.030
<b>After that, a strange person kidnapped me...</b>

12:21.390 --> 12:25.400
<b>But you must have saved me, Supreme Leader.</b>

12:25.980 --> 12:28.690
<b>It wasn't me. It was my subordinates.</b>

12:29.500 --> 12:30.850
<b>I was wrong?!</b>

12:30.850 --> 12:33.230
<b>I jumped to the wrong conclusion.</b>

12:33.980 --> 12:37.210
<b>I was unworthy of their loyalty...</b>

12:38.390 --> 12:41.770
<b>When they stop by, I must thank them.</b>

12:42.300 --> 12:44.230
<b>I will relay your gratitude.</b>

12:45.730 --> 12:47.090
<b>I'll be seeing them soon...</b>

12:53.690 --> 12:56.220
<b>I know. Let's begin.</b>

12:56.840 --> 12:57.930
<b>Yes!</b>

12:58.950 --> 13:01.920
<b>Once, you asked my name.</b>

13:01.920 --> 13:03.630
<b>Y-Yes...</b>

13:04.780 --> 13:06.720
<b>My name is Meruem.</b>

13:08.360 --> 13:09.860
<b><i>Meruem.</i></b>

13:11.360 --> 13:13.990
<b><i>It means the light that illuminates all.</i></b>

13:15.680 --> 13:18.340
<b>Meruem-sama?</b>

13:19.840 --> 13:23.190
<b>M-My name is Komugi...</b>

13:23.190 --> 13:25.480
<b>It is an honor to know you!</b>

13:25.960 --> 13:27.200
<b>I know.</b>

13:27.930 --> 13:28.840
<b>No...</b>

13:29.430 --> 13:30.510
<b><i>That isn't true.</i></b>

13:30.920 --> 13:32.200
<b><i>I knew nothing.</i></b>

13:32.990 --> 13:38.770
<b><i>I didn't understand what really mattered.</i></b>

13:40.680 --> 13:42.640
<b>Meruem-sama?</b>

13:42.640 --> 13:44.170
<b>No honorific is necessary.</b>

13:44.940 --> 13:46.410
<b>Don't make me repeat myself!</b>

13:46.410 --> 13:47.810
<b>No honorific is necessary!</b>

13:47.810 --> 13:50.830
<b>B-But, I could never do that!</b>

13:50.830 --> 13:54.010
<b>I would never dare address 
you without an honorific!</b>

13:54.010 --> 13:59.700
<b>Then if I beat you at Gungi, you will 
address me without the honorific.</b>

14:02.880 --> 14:04.530
<b>I understand.</b>

14:04.530 --> 14:08.850
<b>Do I die after I've addressed 
you without the honorific?</b>

14:08.850 --> 14:11.070
<b>Ah, that's right.</b>

14:12.020 --> 14:13.740
<b>There is no need for you to die.</b>

14:16.100 --> 14:19.000
<b>I am not the same person I was before.</b>

14:19.650 --> 14:22.330
<b>You should be prepared to lose.</b>

14:22.800 --> 14:23.990
<b>Yes!</b>

14:23.990 --> 14:26.970
<b>What do you want if you win?</b>

14:28.460 --> 14:30.760
<b>I would like another match!</b>

14:33.320 --> 14:34.620
<b><i>It was a foolish question.</i></b>

14:36.570 --> 14:37.880
<b>Let's begin, then.</b>

14:41.720 --> 14:43.770
<b>1-5-1, marshal.</b>

14:45.300 --> 14:47.280
<b>9-9-1, marshal.</b>

14:48.360 --> 14:50.710
<b>7-9-1, pawn.</b>

14:52.090 --> 14:54.460
<b>2-3-1, pawn.</b>

14:55.610 --> 14:57.900
<b>2-7-2, musketeer.</b>

14:59.500 --> 15:00.560
<b><i>Could it be?</i></b>

15:01.270 --> 15:03.580
<b>7-1-2, fortress.</b>

15:04.470 --> 15:05.550
<b><i>This is...</i></b>

15:05.750 --> 15:08.550
<b>Marshal</b>

15:06.310 --> 15:07.480
<b><i>...kokoriko?</i></b>

15:09.590 --> 15:13.050
<b>Komugi, do you mean to mock me?</b>

15:13.260 --> 15:14.510
<b>No.</b>

15:14.510 --> 15:16.170
<b>I want a sincere answer.</b>

15:16.530 --> 15:18.650
<b>I will not allow you to fool around.</b>

15:18.650 --> 15:23.060
<b>Yes, I have never fooled around 
while playing Gungi.</b>

15:24.640 --> 15:26.070
<b>Very well.</b>

15:26.480 --> 15:30.400
<b>If you lose, you will die.</b>

15:32.420 --> 15:33.490
<b>Yes.</b>

15:36.660 --> 15:40.540
<b>Certain Death</b>

15:38.140 --> 15:40.770
<b><i>Is she saying this will not 
mean her certain death?</i></b>

15:40.770 --> 15:43.600
<b><i>She had a number of other options.</i></b>

15:43.600 --> 15:47.370
<b><i>But all would only serve to lengthen the</i></b>

15:47.370 --> 15:49.680
<b><i>game without increasing her chances.</i></b>

15:50.910 --> 15:53.150
<b><i>If she thinks she has a chance to win...</i></b>

15:55.040 --> 15:58.060
<b>9-2-1, new lieutenant general.</b>

15:58.930 --> 16:00.320
<b><i>I want to see</i></b>

16:01.880 --> 16:03.060

16:15.500 --> 16:18.130
<b>4-6-2, spy.</b>

16:19.210 --> 16:21.330
<b><i>Th-This is...</i></b>

16:28.230 --> 16:29.400
<b><i>She</i></b>

16:30.200 --> 16:31.840
<b><i>has found a way out.</i></b>

16:32.470 --> 16:36.570
<b>That night, I realized something.</b>

16:36.570 --> 16:37.490
<b>Quiet!</b>

16:38.610 --> 16:39.990
<b>Let me think.</b>

16:48.190 --> 16:49.110
<b><i>Here.</i></b>

16:49.940 --> 16:51.110
<b><i>This is the only way to go!</i></b>

16:53.030 --> 16:54.520
<b><i>I should be able to checkmate her!</i></b>

16:55.040 --> 16:59.280
<b><i>When she's forced closer to my position, 
my advantage grows with each move.</i></b>

17:00.070 --> 17:04.840
<b><i>But if she slows down and allows 
me a turn to attack,</i></b>

17:04.840 --> 17:08.110
<b><i>she can't stop the knight 
and lieutenant general!</i></b>

17:09.660 --> 17:11.630
<b>2-6-1, knight!</b>

17:12.230 --> 17:13.760
<b><i>I reversed her new move!</i></b>

17:13.760 --> 17:14.630
<b><i>What now?</i></b>

17:21.440 --> 17:22.400
<b>What is wrong?</b>

17:23.150 --> 17:24.420
<b>Why do you cry?</b>

17:25.050 --> 17:26.240
<b>Am I...</b>

17:27.200 --> 17:30.150
<b>Am I allowed</b>

17:30.840 --> 17:33.400

<b>I...</b>

17:59.530 --> 18:01.220
<b>I have been poisoned,</b>

18:01.670 --> 18:02.930

18:03.550 --> 18:05.420
<b>Meruem-sama...</b>

<b>Komugi, I wanted...</b>

18:11.010 --> 18:13.690

playing against you.</b>

18:15.650 --> 18:19.290

18:57.580 --> 18:58.740
<b><i>I...</i></b>

19:00.660 --> 19:03.240
<b>I believe</b>

19:04.490 --> 19:07.400
<b>that I was born to be here today.</b>

19:10.840 --> 19:14.950
<b><i>...was born for this moment.</i></b>
