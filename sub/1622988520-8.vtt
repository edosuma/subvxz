00:06.397 --> 00:08.704
Previously on
"Kevin Can F... Himself"...

00:08.747 --> 00:10.097
Make it look
like a robbery,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.012
and as soon as it's done,
you'll get the money.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.101
You can't fire me.
They'll throw me
in prison.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.580
Change of plans.
We're leaving tonight.

00:15.624 --> 00:18.105
I don't know when
you got so broken.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.671
Uugh!

00:19.715 --> 00:21.934
Damn it! [Sniffs]

00:21.978 --> 00:23.240
Where are you going?

00:23.284 --> 00:25.155
Maybe I don't want
to waste the next 15 years

00:25.199 --> 00:27.549
trying to
distract myself.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.464
You are
the right person.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.205
You.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.771
Okay.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.425
[Clang!]There's someone
in the house.

00:34.469 --> 00:35.687
Is that a gun?

00:55.142 --> 00:56.447
What? I'm stressed out.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.797
Arrest me.

00:58.841 --> 01:02.105
Don't really.[Door opens]

01:02.149 --> 01:03.933
Hey.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.936
God. Patty.

01:06.979 --> 01:09.547
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. McRoberts.

01:11.462 --> 01:14.422
Hey, you.
Hi.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.815
Officer Ridgeway.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.600
Right.[Siren wailing in distance]

01:18.643 --> 01:21.559
Listen, I can't imagine how hard
all this has been for you.

01:21.603 --> 01:22.995
Yeah.But you may not want

01:23.039 --> 01:26.521
to go visit your mother,
or go out of town at all.

01:26.564 --> 01:29.176
In case
we need anything else.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.395
Uh, like what?

01:31.439 --> 01:35.617
We don't take shootings lightly,
and your husband --

01:35.660 --> 01:37.532
What about me?I was just saying

01:37.575 --> 01:39.316
you were involved
in a terrible ordeal,

01:39.360 --> 01:41.013
one we're gonna
get to the bottom of.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.320
I feel like I'm in
some sort of awful dream.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.061
But I don't
want you to worry.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.803
We know you did what you had
to do to protect your family.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.413
I just --
I don't understand

01:49.457 --> 01:52.068
why someone would
break into our home.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.027
Everyone thinks they're special,
that this can't happen to them.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.333
[Chuckles] No, no.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.988
Our home is crappy.
It's a dumb move.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.033
Around here, random break-ins
are usually drug-related.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.644
It's desperation.

02:02.687 --> 02:06.169
They're looking for anything
they can pawn for a few bucks.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.823
So, is that
what you think this is?

02:07.866 --> 02:09.912
S-Stealing for drug money?

02:09.955 --> 02:11.609
We'll know more
once the warrant goes through

02:11.653 --> 02:13.611
and we get into his place.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.352
When will that be?

02:15.396 --> 02:17.224
Likely tomorrow afternoon.

02:17.267 --> 02:20.444
And that lowlife won't be around
to let us in himself.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.272
Kevin made sure of that.[Scoffs]

02:22.316 --> 02:25.362
Wait. Did he --
Has he --

02:25.406 --> 02:27.799
They pulled the plug on him
a few minutes ago.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.410
Oh.

02:29.453 --> 02:32.848
Drugs really are
the scourge of our time.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.633
I'd argue heart disease. [Laughter]

02:35.677 --> 02:38.201
Just numbers-wise.

02:38.245 --> 02:42.031
Babe, this is not some sort
of smushed artery, alright?

02:42.074 --> 02:44.990
Some drugged-up dude
was in our house.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.079
He could've --

02:47.123 --> 02:48.429
We could've --

02:48.472 --> 02:51.301
I know. I know, babe.

02:51.345 --> 02:55.305
Kev, I've been a cop 22 years
now, and let me tell you,

02:55.349 --> 02:58.439
not very many families come out
of this stuff unscathed.

02:58.482 --> 02:59.788
You're one of
the lucky ones.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.877
Heh. Yeah.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.880
Lucky. Come on.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.843
[Laughter]

03:20.287 --> 03:24.856
â™ª

03:24.900 --> 03:26.684
Buddy!

03:26.728 --> 03:28.120
Alright!
I'm alright.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.731
No, you're not.

03:29.774 --> 03:33.256
Your airway's being constricted
by 230 pounds of idiot.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.084
[Laughter]

03:35.127 --> 03:38.305
I get a little emotional when
I think about losing you, Kev.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.655
Yeah. Well, I don't like
thinking about it, either.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.222
That's why you don't.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.485
You got to push all those
thoughts and feelings

03:44.528 --> 03:46.138
way down into your stomach

03:46.182 --> 03:47.966
until it creates,
like, a little hole

03:48.010 --> 03:50.926
where you can keep
all that stuff.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.755
A cookie pocket.

03:53.798 --> 03:57.106
That's an ulcer, Pete.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.063
No.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.327
It's a cookie pocket.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.893
You eat cookies,
and you feel better.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.286
Psh.
Thinks she's a nurse now,

04:03.330 --> 04:07.203
telling us what
a cookie pocket is. Heh.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.945
I just can't believe
that someone was in here.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.774
I know. And the dude was on
my hockey team in high school.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.079
Couldn't shoot
then, either.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.213
[Both chuckle]

04:17.257 --> 04:20.608
You okay, bro?
You look like Patty after --

04:20.651 --> 04:23.567
Oh, my God. Right now.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.265
I don't know, bro.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.702
It's like there's something
weighing down my eyebrows,

04:27.745 --> 04:29.747
making me frown.

04:29.791 --> 04:30.922
That's called marriage.

04:30.966 --> 04:34.622
[Both laugh]

04:34.665 --> 04:36.014
Did you hear
that one, son?

04:36.058 --> 04:37.973
I said,
"That's called marriage."

04:38.016 --> 04:39.017
Up top!

04:39.061 --> 04:40.976
[Both laugh]

04:41.019 --> 04:42.891
Yeah, it's, uh --

04:42.934 --> 04:44.980
It's just not doing it for me.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.896
Whoa.
This is serious.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.767
I know.
I know.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.378
That was a hilarious joke,

04:51.421 --> 04:55.512
and yet it's like
my laugh button's on the fritz.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.384
God.
What is wrong with me?

04:57.427 --> 04:59.864
No, y-you're being too hard
on yourself, son.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.997
Look, this all just happened.Yeah.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.392
Good Catholic repression
takes time.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.828
And sleep.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.395
You know what?
That's it.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.354
You need a good snooze
to fix you up.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.051
Yeah. Yeah.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.445
Maybe that'll do it.Sure.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.840
You want me to make you
a nice, comfy fort to nap in?

05:18.883 --> 05:21.277
No thanks, bro.Oh, come on.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.018
Makes you feel like a caveman
all tuckered

05:23.061 --> 05:24.846
from a long day
of hunting dinosaurs.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.587
I said no!

05:26.630 --> 05:28.284
I --

05:28.328 --> 05:30.765
I just need to be alone.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.332
I just wanted to help.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.769
I know, buddy. Look, he's
probably just starting

05:34.812 --> 05:37.424
to realize what we all knew
years ago.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.817
That forts are dumb?

05:39.861 --> 05:42.646
Yeah.
Forts are dumb.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.344
[Laughter]

05:49.131 --> 05:50.262
[Quietly]
Okay, what the hell --

05:50.306 --> 05:52.090
[Whispering] It was Nick.What?

05:52.134 --> 05:53.657
He wasn't supposed to come
for another week.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.399
Oh, trust me, I know.
But why listen to instruction

05:56.443 --> 05:58.096
when it's more fun
to come on a night when Kevin's

05:58.140 --> 05:59.446
amped on Red Bull
and has a gun?

05:59.489 --> 06:01.883
I know.
Who would give Kevin a gun?

06:01.926 --> 06:04.407
Oh. We did.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.148
You know the gun
you hit the trucker with?

06:06.191 --> 06:07.454
The one we planted
in the backyard?

06:07.497 --> 06:09.586
He found it.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.892
How?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.372
Because of course he did!

06:12.415 --> 06:14.069
Because he has a metal detector,
and it's Kevin!

06:14.112 --> 06:15.723
We should have
seen this coming.

06:15.766 --> 06:18.029
No -- Patty, you cannot
bail on me right --

06:18.073 --> 06:19.857
[Door opens]

06:24.645 --> 06:26.168
Here.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.910
Take a sip of this
every time you want to yell.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.434
Like a drinking game?Whatever gets you to be quiet.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.918
God.
It's kind of miraculous

06:36.961 --> 06:40.617
how little last night
helped us with anything.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.576
Tammy's still looking
for her dealer.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.447
Kevin's...

06:44.491 --> 06:46.318
still Kevin.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.929
This is why
you don't make plans.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.626
You make plans,
and God laughs.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.280
Then he kicks you
right in the balls.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.934
No.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.370
I still have plans.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.155
[Sighs]
Jesus, Allison, what's next?

06:57.199 --> 06:58.766
You gonna lure Kevin
to a booby trap

06:58.809 --> 07:00.681
with a jar of honey?

07:00.724 --> 07:02.465
No.
But what are you gonna do?

07:02.509 --> 07:06.121
Just roll over
and accept it?

07:06.164 --> 07:08.384
Everything happens
for a reason.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.431
Okay, you would hit me
if I said something like that.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.607
No, Tammy is not gonna know
that you dealt,

07:13.650 --> 07:16.871
and I am not gonna sit here
and rot as Mrs. McRoberts.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.744
[Sighs]

07:20.788 --> 07:22.616
What are your plans?

07:22.659 --> 07:24.748
Okay.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.358
We're gonna take the pill bottle
and the cash

07:26.402 --> 07:27.708
we were gonna plant
around Kevin's body,

07:27.751 --> 07:29.971
and we're gonna put them
in Nick's apartment.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.364
We connect him to Furies,
and he's the perfect candidate

07:32.408 --> 07:34.976
for, like,
the local dealer fall guy.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.369
It makes even more sense
than Kevin.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.546
Tha--

07:39.589 --> 07:41.765
That could work.Right?

07:41.809 --> 07:44.638
And he's dead,
so he's not even gonna mind.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.378
Plus, Tammy said that she still
doesn't have the warrant,

07:46.422 --> 07:47.379
so we have time.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.381
We just need to act fast.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.514
Jesus. Hold on!

07:51.558 --> 07:54.299
Hey --

07:54.343 --> 07:55.692
How does this help you?

07:55.736 --> 07:57.389
What do you get out of it?

07:57.433 --> 08:01.785
â™ª

08:01.829 --> 08:04.179
I get to know you're safe.

08:04.222 --> 08:10.141
â™ª

08:10.185 --> 08:16.191
â™ª

08:17.801 --> 08:19.237
Can I get a plastic bag?

08:22.589 --> 08:24.155
It's heavy.

08:28.638 --> 08:29.987
Thank you.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.207
[Siren wailing in distance]

08:38.953 --> 08:41.912
â™ª

08:41.956 --> 08:43.566
Patty: Oh.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.395
â™ª

08:46.438 --> 08:49.006
Oh. Shit. Jesus.

08:49.050 --> 08:52.357
â™ª

08:52.401 --> 08:55.665
[Both grunt]

08:55.709 --> 08:57.928
Shut up.What? I mean --

08:57.972 --> 08:59.626
Just help me.
Okay.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.192
Just --

09:01.236 --> 09:07.242
â™ª

09:07.285 --> 09:09.592
Okay.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.202
Let's stash this stuff
and get out of here.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.291
Okay.

09:13.335 --> 09:16.251
It's fine, Allison.
Nobody's home.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.992
Okay.
[Sighs]

09:20.124 --> 09:23.084
You think this guy hides stuff
in his sock drawer?

09:23.127 --> 09:25.652
Well, it's where my dad
kept our savings bonds.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.567
[Sighs]

09:27.610 --> 09:29.612
Okay.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.658
So...

09:31.701 --> 09:34.399
Kevin actually seems
affected by this.

09:34.443 --> 09:37.489
Yeah, today.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.666
And what about you?

09:39.709 --> 09:42.669
Are you, like...
okay?

09:42.712 --> 09:43.931
Do I not look okay?

09:43.974 --> 09:46.063
That's what I mean.
You look fine.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.543
You saw a dude get shot --

09:47.587 --> 09:49.501
you could even say
it's your fault --

09:49.545 --> 09:52.156
Ourfault.And it's like, "Oh, well,

09:52.200 --> 09:53.897
let's head over
and frame the guy."

09:53.941 --> 09:55.507
Well, what do you
want me to do?

09:55.551 --> 09:57.814
"Deal with it" and end up
crying in the bathtub again?

09:57.858 --> 09:59.816
That's useless.
Yeah.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.732
But it would freak me out
a lot less, believe it or not.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.389
Shoot.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.653
What have we said
about swearing?

10:10.697 --> 10:13.656
Okay.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.962
Help me.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.833
Why are we
unpacking for him?

10:16.877 --> 10:18.574
He was about to leave.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.358
If he broke into our house
for random drug stuff,

10:20.402 --> 10:22.099
why would he be
getting out of town?

10:22.143 --> 10:23.535
It looks premeditated.

10:23.579 --> 10:24.841
The minute Tammy sees this,

10:24.885 --> 10:27.148
she's gonna be asking
even more questions.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.845
Okay, well, I don't think

10:28.889 --> 10:30.064
you need to put his stuff
on hangers.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.258
[Panting]
Patty, hi.

11:34.302 --> 11:37.740
I --
I thought I'd stop by.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.177
See how you're doing.

11:40.221 --> 11:43.572
I was jogging.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.574
[Muffled]
I heard about Nick.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.750
That's tough.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.405
That's...nice of you.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.059
Not many people come by
with casseroles

11:52.102 --> 11:54.017
for this sorta thing.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.802
Definitely didn't think
you would.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.630
Well, I, uh --
I don't have a casserole.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.807
Well,
w-w-what was he doing?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.243
I, um...

12:02.286 --> 12:04.636
I heard that he broke
into somebody's house.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.683
Wasn't it
in your neighborhood?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.163
You know...

12:09.206 --> 12:11.208
Yeah.[Both chuckle]

12:11.252 --> 12:12.993
I guess it was.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.690
Uh...yeah, that's weird.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.520
Mm. Cops have been trying
to get in here, sniff around.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.435
But I know my rights.Yeah. 'Course.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.784
No warrant, no entry.No warrant, no entry.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.612
Goddamn right.Well, there's no telling

12:23.655 --> 12:25.440
what they could pin on him
if they actually got down there.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.442
QuÃ© frickin' Sera
as far as I'm concerned.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.660
Whatever else
they wanna put on him,

12:28.704 --> 12:31.054
I'm sure he's deserves it.
[Sighs]

12:31.098 --> 12:32.795
But, you know, eh,

12:32.839 --> 12:34.362
I'm not gonna make
the cops' lives easier

12:34.405 --> 12:36.668
by just lettin' 'em in.

12:36.712 --> 12:40.672
Nicky can deal with them
when he wakes up.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.849
Wakes up?

12:42.892 --> 12:44.241
Didn't you pull the plug?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.461
Yeah.
But he's still hanging on.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.811
I mean, they say it's critical,
but they don't know.

12:48.855 --> 12:52.467
Guys like Nick always
beat the odds somehow.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.643
[Glass shatters]

12:54.686 --> 12:59.300
â™ª

12:59.343 --> 13:02.520
I'll --

13:02.564 --> 13:04.827
I'll be praying for him.

13:04.871 --> 13:09.049
â™ª

13:09.092 --> 13:10.441
Yeah.

13:10.485 --> 13:18.101
â™ª

13:18.145 --> 13:20.887
Nick gets whatever's
coming to him.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.627
I don't know
what he was getting into,

13:22.671 --> 13:25.195
but I know I want
to stay out of it.

13:25.239 --> 13:33.856
â™ª

13:33.900 --> 13:42.865
â™ª

13:42.909 --> 13:51.569
â™ª

13:51.613 --> 13:53.745
Oh, great.
We've been waiting hours.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.747
Cable's out in the pool room,
and the fight's tonight.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.314
Sorry, bro. I'm off-duty.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.273
Looking for a beer.

13:59.316 --> 14:03.016
I tried going to work, but cable
maintenance just feels so...

14:03.059 --> 14:04.582
pointless.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.889
Not if you want to watch
the fight.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.892
I feel...different.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.373
I tried so many things
to make it better.

14:12.416 --> 14:15.767
Napping, sleeping it off,
resting my eyes.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.596
Still...
I'm just not myself.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.729
So, I figured
I'd try a beer.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.513
I've heard worse plans.

14:27.344 --> 14:30.086
It's like
it has no taste.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.175
What did I possibly do
to deserve this

14:32.219 --> 14:34.830
and someone
breaking into my home?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.180
Oh.
You had a break-in?

14:37.224 --> 14:40.923
Yeah, but I got to him
before he could take anything.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.578
I stopped him
right in his tracks.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.754
And what do I get for it?

14:45.797 --> 14:49.366
All of these...feelings.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.499
And beer with no taste.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.804
Life isn't fair, man.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.763
If it were, the universe
would send a cable guy

14:54.806 --> 14:57.244
who'd actually
fix the cable.

14:57.287 --> 15:00.247
Hey, bro, the world
is not unfair, okay?

15:00.290 --> 15:02.989
The world is broken,

15:03.032 --> 15:05.948
and I'm telling you,
it's been broken for awhile.

15:05.992 --> 15:09.647
Foreigner neighbors
steal your packages.

15:09.691 --> 15:13.390
Wives lose your 10% discount
at the liquor store.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.392
Sean Avery eats
in a Worcester restaurant

15:15.436 --> 15:16.785
and doesn't get assaulted.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.439
[Laughter]

15:18.482 --> 15:21.050
The world is going to hell
in a hand basket,

15:21.094 --> 15:24.880
and no one's doing
a thing about it.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.273
Thanks, but I don't really
feel like paying

15:26.316 --> 15:28.275
for another tasteless beer.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.972
Good.
This one's on the house.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.278
Why?

15:31.321 --> 15:33.802
'Cause the world
isgoing to hell.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.239
But youdid
something about it.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.806
Damn right.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.330
We need someone
who tells it like it is.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.071
And I got your next one.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.899
Well, alright, then.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.987
I accept.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.774
I can taste it again!

15:49.818 --> 15:51.341
[Laughing] Alright!

15:51.385 --> 15:53.039
Cheers, bud.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.997
[Sighs]

15:55.041 --> 15:57.913
I really thought we were dead
when she opened that door.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.742
I've never moved so fast
in my life, I swear.

16:00.785 --> 16:04.137
Ask any gym teacher
I've ever had.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.486
God.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.444
I think this is gonna work.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.490
We're done.
It's done.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.884
Is that even possible?

16:12.928 --> 16:15.235
Hey, that's littering.I gotta quit.

16:15.278 --> 16:18.238
Why not, right?

16:18.281 --> 16:19.369
Hey, this is gonna work.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.502
I know it.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.852
No, something's off.

16:23.895 --> 16:27.247
The way Tammy told me
to not go out of town, it --

16:27.290 --> 16:28.813
she's not done with me.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.729
And Nick is -- is still alive,
by the way.

16:31.773 --> 16:34.732
In a critical coma.

16:34.776 --> 16:38.040
You're just looking
for problems, Barbie.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.477
Even if he does wake up,
who's gonna believe him

16:40.521 --> 16:42.523
when he says
he's not the dealer?

16:42.566 --> 16:44.264
Uh, what about
when he says,

16:44.307 --> 16:46.831
"That broad hired me
to kill her husband"?

16:46.875 --> 16:49.095
Oh, honey,
you are not a broad.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.445
Listen to me.
You're all set, okay?

16:51.488 --> 16:52.663
You're free to go.
I get that.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.143
And you're welcome,
by the way.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.668
But I am still in a deep
pile of shit over here.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.540
You don't
know that for sure.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.107
[Sighs] I know, but
what am I supposed to do?

17:01.150 --> 17:04.110
Just sit around and hope
everything works out?

17:04.153 --> 17:07.330
What's the alternative?

17:07.374 --> 17:09.811
You always make fun of me
for saying "I hope," but --

17:09.854 --> 17:12.335
I remember once.No, but you're right.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.337
It's dangerous.
I need to know.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.252
I need to know
what Tammy's thinking.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.733
I need to know
if she's still onto me.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.561
And how are you
gonna do that?

17:20.604 --> 17:21.953
Like, we need to know
what's going on.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.565
We need to know
what to expect.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.132
What happened last night
cannot happen again.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.960
We need to be
a step ahead.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.919
How are you gonna
do that, Allison?

17:34.183 --> 17:35.880
Next time
you're hanging out,

17:35.924 --> 17:37.621
I want you to look
in that little notebook

17:37.665 --> 17:42.148
that she always writes in and --
and she what it says about me.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.540
Uh, I can't --

17:43.584 --> 17:45.194
Patty, I need
your help, okay?

17:45.238 --> 17:48.545
I hate saying that, but when
I'm alone, I just -- I...

17:48.589 --> 17:51.287
do things like
marry Kevin.

17:55.378 --> 18:00.166
Hey, you and -- you and Tammy
are friends, right?

18:00.209 --> 18:02.516
You're the one that said
that this could be good for us.

18:02.559 --> 18:03.908
It could be useful.

18:03.952 --> 18:06.737
And now it actually is.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.524
I don't know
if I can do it.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.179
Of course you can.
It's not a big deal.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.615
Girlfriends, you know,

18:14.658 --> 18:16.617
go through each other's stuff
all the time.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.097
If she catches you,
you just say,

18:18.140 --> 18:21.143
"Oh, I was borrowing
your lipstick" or something.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.580
You've never had girlfriends,
have you?

18:23.624 --> 18:26.366
â™ª

18:26.409 --> 18:29.195
I have you.

18:29.238 --> 18:32.154
Right?

18:32.198 --> 18:33.373
Yeah.

18:33.416 --> 18:40.249
â™ª

18:40.293 --> 18:42.338
Put it higher. I don't know.
He wants it lower.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.471
Oh, good.
Another banner.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.082
Damn right! [Laughter]

18:47.126 --> 18:48.431
Jesus, Kevin.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.216
Well, you seem
back to yourself.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.434
I'm not just myself.

18:51.478 --> 18:54.176
I'm improved, baby!

18:54.220 --> 18:56.352
Impossible, bro.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.441
It all began when I stopped
by the bar for a beer

18:58.485 --> 19:00.356
while I was supposed
to be at work.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.749
Great start.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.490
So, there I was,
surrounded by

19:03.533 --> 19:05.883
a bunch of good,
salt-of-the-earth guys

19:05.927 --> 19:07.581
having their
10:00 a.m. drink,

19:07.624 --> 19:12.107
and I start doing my thing,
you know?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.979
What's your thing?

19:15.023 --> 19:17.678
Telling it like it is.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.463
I thought your thing was
designing classy Red Sox jerseys

19:20.507 --> 19:23.205
you could wear to a funeral.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.207
That's my old thing, Neil.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.862
Telling it like it is
is what I do now,

19:27.905 --> 19:30.125
and these guys --
they loved it.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.735
Before you know it,
I got three free beers

19:31.779 --> 19:33.476
in front of me
with more on the way,

19:33.520 --> 19:34.651
and that's when it happened.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.653
Boom! I felt better!

19:36.697 --> 19:39.090
I felt like myself again!

19:39.134 --> 19:40.266
So you got drunk.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.442
He said 3 beers, Patty,
not 30.

19:42.485 --> 19:43.921
[Laughter]

19:43.965 --> 19:47.273
I suddenly understood
why the break-in happened.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.058
You know, like,
what it all means.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.234
I have
a higher calling, babe.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.236
I'm running for office!

19:54.280 --> 19:56.064
[Laughter]

20:00.677 --> 20:03.245
That's right.
I'm running for city council.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.508
Kevin McRoberts --
I'm tough on crime,

20:05.552 --> 20:08.468
but soft on the pointless stuff,
like taxes.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.121
[Laughter]

20:10.165 --> 20:13.081
Could that be
my campaign slogan?

20:13.124 --> 20:14.256
Damn.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.911
No, no. Not damn to you,
Mrs. Slutsky.

20:16.954 --> 20:20.436
I was obviously referring
to the Hoover.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.874
I'm also tough
on foul language.

20:23.918 --> 20:24.962
Okay.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.660
Can't believe
she bought that.

20:26.703 --> 20:29.750
Oh, Kev, you're in a position
every politician dreams of --

20:29.793 --> 20:31.317
all your constituents
are idiots.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.188
This thing is yours!

20:33.232 --> 20:36.757
Kev, don't you think this whole
thing is, like, kinda lame?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.324
Uh, no.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.674
I think it's classy
and important,

20:40.717 --> 20:44.721
like country clubs
or Jessica Rabbit.

20:44.765 --> 20:45.853
Oh.
Hey, Allison.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.289
I'm happy to se you.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.292
Has everything
about you changed?

20:50.336 --> 20:52.294
Hey, that hottie
Detective Tammy Ridgeway

20:52.338 --> 20:54.340
just called and said
that the guy that broke in here

20:54.383 --> 20:56.342
was some sorta drug dealer,

20:56.385 --> 20:58.779
a real scourge
of our time.

20:58.822 --> 20:59.997
Really?

21:00.041 --> 21:02.043
She told you that
for sure?
Yep.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.088
And I got him
off the streets. [Chuckles]

21:04.132 --> 21:07.744
The campaign is off
to a rockin' start!

21:07.788 --> 21:09.616
You're really running?Of course.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.052
It's my life's dream.

21:11.095 --> 21:12.358
Okay, it's just
that you usually, you know,

21:12.401 --> 21:15.012
forget about your life's
dream before lunch.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.188
Give me one example.

21:17.232 --> 21:18.581
Uh, well, three days ago,

21:18.625 --> 21:21.758
your life's dream
was to become a father.

21:21.802 --> 21:24.021
Oh, God.
I forgot.

21:24.065 --> 21:26.763
Man, that was
a close call, too.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.418
Oh,
what a hard week for you.

21:29.462 --> 21:33.988
It's just that I figured out
that my higher purpose is...

21:34.031 --> 21:37.339
fathering the entire community.
[Laughs]

21:37.383 --> 21:40.211
And it all begins tonight
at my first campaign event

21:40.255 --> 21:43.998
at the classy
and important Moose Lodge.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.869
You say "classy" a lot.

21:45.913 --> 21:48.045
Uh...do you know
what classy means?

21:48.089 --> 21:51.092
[Cellphone chimes]Uh, Kev, bad news.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.398
Looks like the Mooses
have pulled out.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.964
Oh, no.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.357
Hey, listen,
when you get elected,

21:55.401 --> 21:58.012
we revoke their liquor license
as payback.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.405
[Laughs]

21:59.448 --> 22:01.015
I-I don't know, Kev.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.669
I think you should probably
just throw in the towel.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.061
He's got a point.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.237
You know, finding a venue,
revoking stuff.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.544
It's -- It's -- It's just a lot
of verbs for you.

22:08.588 --> 22:09.937
[Laughter]

22:09.980 --> 22:12.287
That is true.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.028
So, let's forget this whole
"higher purpose" thing

22:14.071 --> 22:15.769
and play
ultimate hide and seek.

22:15.812 --> 22:18.641
[Laughter]

22:18.685 --> 22:23.342
No. I know how to handle
a little adversity, okay?[Doorbell rings]

22:23.385 --> 22:26.475
I just need to sit around,
do nothing at all,

22:26.519 --> 22:29.435
and wait for God
to provide a solution.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.784
And He always does.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.046
Like that gun
He put in your back yard.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.091
Exactly. Pew-pew.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.006
[Laughter]

22:37.617 --> 22:39.619
[Doorbell rings]

22:39.662 --> 22:42.404
Hi.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.972
Hi?

22:45.015 --> 22:48.279
Can I, uh, come in?

22:48.323 --> 22:49.846
Inside here?

22:49.890 --> 22:51.587
No, Kevin is home.
This is not a good time.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.415
It's not like that.
I promise.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.070
He could have opened the door
and it'd be fine.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.647
Thanks.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.132
I, uh...

23:15.176 --> 23:17.874
I like
your coffee table.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.833
It's very MoMa.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.312
Sam, what are you
doing here?

23:21.356 --> 23:22.705
Yeah. Right. Sorry.
I was sort of ramping up

23:22.749 --> 23:24.881
to the apology,
and, um...

23:24.925 --> 23:26.883
I am...

23:26.927 --> 23:29.625
sorry.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.932
You were trying to do
the right thing the other day,

23:31.975 --> 23:33.107
to work on your marriage,

23:33.150 --> 23:36.197
and I-I can't stand
the fact

23:36.240 --> 23:38.460
that we left things like that,
and --

23:38.504 --> 23:39.940
and then I heard
about that guy,

23:39.983 --> 23:43.552
the one who broke in here,
and...

23:43.596 --> 23:45.946
God, if something
ever happened to you,

23:45.989 --> 23:49.384
and the last things we said were
that you thought I didn't --

23:49.428 --> 23:52.605
[Sighs]

23:52.648 --> 23:54.781
I'm so sorry.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.739
I had to come by and see
how you were both doing

23:56.783 --> 23:57.958
after everything,

23:58.001 --> 24:00.134
and if you need anything,
don't --

24:03.137 --> 24:04.530
Wait, what are you doing?I don't know.

24:04.573 --> 24:08.316
We cannot do that here.I know.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.405
But I wanted to.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.408
So do I, but that's no reason
to risk blowing up your life.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.758
I mean... [Chuckles]

24:15.802 --> 24:17.064
isn't it?

24:18.805 --> 24:21.372
Do you mean that?

24:21.416 --> 24:23.853
Yeah.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.681
Yeah, I think I do.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.685
I left Jenn.

24:32.775 --> 24:34.516
You --

24:34.560 --> 24:35.561
Yeah.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.693
I can't stay in that house
anymore.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.216
I couldn't.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.045
And, uh, if you're feeling
that same way, too,

24:42.089 --> 24:46.615
then maybe
this is our chance, you know,

24:46.659 --> 24:49.705
to really be together.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.577
â™ª

24:51.620 --> 24:52.752
[Laughs]

24:52.795 --> 24:54.623
Oh, hey, Allison.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.407
God, do you always have
to enter a room like that?

24:56.451 --> 24:59.454
It's how winners
go through swinging doors.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.936
Oh. Now I know why
you never lasted as a waiter.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.546
You're proving my point.

25:04.590 --> 25:08.202
What kinda winner has ever
worked at a restaurant?

25:08.245 --> 25:09.551
Oh.

25:09.595 --> 25:12.859
Hey, there, Allison's boss
from the diner.

25:12.902 --> 25:13.816
How you doing, Kevin?

25:13.860 --> 25:16.036
I'm a winner, Sal.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.255
Sam.
Even better.

25:18.299 --> 25:21.389
Now, Sam, don't you feel
there's a dire need

25:21.432 --> 25:23.260
for real change
in this neighborhood?

25:23.304 --> 25:26.655
Uh...And I'm talking about
the good kind of change,

25:26.699 --> 25:29.832
the kind that gets things back
to the way they used to be.

25:29.876 --> 25:30.790
I actually like --

25:30.833 --> 25:33.227
Then please,
do the world a favor

25:33.270 --> 25:34.794
and vote for Kevin.

25:34.837 --> 25:38.580
[Laughter]

25:38.624 --> 25:41.844
Thanks.
Uh, well, I should get going.

25:41.888 --> 25:43.280
Um, I just came by
to tell Allison

25:43.324 --> 25:44.804
she could take some time off
if she needs it.

25:44.847 --> 25:47.589
It's a little slow right now,
anyways.

25:47.633 --> 25:48.721
Ugh! Wait!

25:48.764 --> 25:50.070
Stroke!
What?

25:50.113 --> 25:52.507
No,
it's not what you think.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.031
Allison is always saying
how your diner is dead.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.859
Devoid of customers.

25:56.903 --> 25:59.862
Slower than a herd of turtles
on a peanut butter race track.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.603
Okay.
Well, I never say that.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.083
It's perfect!

26:03.126 --> 26:05.651
Your diner is the perfect spot
to be my venue!

26:05.694 --> 26:07.304
It's so empty!
Okay.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.480
Well, it's not --But hey, with me,

26:09.524 --> 26:12.832
you'll have a solid stream
of hearty, hungry customers.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.050
Oh, my God.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.662
We'll call it
a "meat and greet"!

26:16.705 --> 26:18.620
Well, maybe Sam
doesn't want --
No, no.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.056
No, like a meatand greet.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.668
Meat like M-E-A-T.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.887
Right,
but maybe Sam doesn't --No, no, no.

26:24.931 --> 26:27.498
Meat, like salami.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.414
Ah!
Sam, it's perfect!

26:30.458 --> 26:32.286
Uh...sure.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.548
I could always use
the business.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.245
Yeah, baby!

26:35.289 --> 26:37.770
The campaign of Kevin
is saved!

26:37.813 --> 26:40.250
Neil: Damn it!

26:40.294 --> 26:42.383
He'll be fine.

26:44.167 --> 26:48.084
I always wonder what sucker buys
the product ina salon?

26:50.173 --> 26:51.653
Not many, I guess.

26:51.697 --> 26:55.875
Trust me, there are plenty
of suckers in this town.

26:56.963 --> 27:00.314
It's been a little slow.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.142
Did you even have
any appointments today?

27:02.185 --> 27:06.276
I mean, we could've gone
bowling or something.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.583
I was hoping
for some walk-ins.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.891
When did business
start dying down?

27:11.934 --> 27:13.893
I don't know.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.677
Recently.

27:15.721 --> 27:20.943
â™ª

27:20.987 --> 27:22.597
I, uh...

27:22.641 --> 27:25.600
heard you caught
your dealer.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.777
The guy who broke
into Allison's house?

27:28.821 --> 27:32.738
Yeah. We got into his house
this morning with a warrant.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.522
His aunt
offered me some coffee,

27:34.565 --> 27:36.176
which I'm pretty sure
was light with cream and spit,

27:36.219 --> 27:38.526
but we got
what we needed.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.095
That's...

27:42.138 --> 27:43.749
great.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.968
[Exhales sharply]

27:46.012 --> 27:49.102
So glad to have that lowlife
off the streets.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.930
Well, it's easy to call him
a lowlife,

27:50.973 --> 27:54.324
but he isn't much different
than any other guy in this town.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.805
Hey,
you wanna get outta here?

27:56.849 --> 27:58.415
I could close up shop
a little early

27:58.459 --> 28:00.548
and we could go
to Kevin's campaign event.

28:00.591 --> 28:01.810
Uh, I don't --
I don't know --

28:01.854 --> 28:03.594
Allison's been
texting me updates,

28:03.638 --> 28:05.727
and it seems like one of those
really fun train wrecks.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.207
They're not
my kinda company.

28:07.250 --> 28:10.036
Kevin's an idiot,
but whatever happened

28:10.079 --> 28:12.125
to "lowlifes are people,
too"?

28:12.168 --> 28:14.954
Yeah, um,
I meant Allison.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.433
What?

28:16.477 --> 28:18.435
I just don't get a good
feeling off her.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.220
I'd like to say I trust her
as far as I can throw her,

28:20.263 --> 28:23.832
but she's like this big.

28:23.876 --> 28:26.226
Yeah. Okay.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.749
We can skip watching
the downfall

28:27.793 --> 28:31.622
of the political system
and just hang out.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.624
Maybe go bowling.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.018
Thank you.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.759
Hey,
you got a ladies'?

28:37.803 --> 28:39.413
Yeah,
it's in the back.

28:39.456 --> 28:44.766
â™ª

28:44.810 --> 28:46.550
[Door opens]

28:46.594 --> 28:49.031
â™ª

28:49.075 --> 28:50.772
[Door closes]

28:50.816 --> 28:56.604
â™ª

29:00.260 --> 29:02.305
Remember,
Kevin McRoberts --

29:02.349 --> 29:04.351
Because the World is
Going to Hell.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.614
[Laughter]

29:06.657 --> 29:09.095
Okay.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.793
Okay, yeah, that is not
the campaign slogan, either.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.056
No, no. You gotta
keep it simple, like, uh --

29:14.100 --> 29:16.842
like maybe just your name
with an exclamation point.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.366
Kev!

29:19.409 --> 29:20.846
Hey. Hey.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.239
The ice cream truck, the good
one with the Mickey pops,

29:23.283 --> 29:24.632
it's only four blocks away.

29:24.675 --> 29:25.807
If we haul ass,
we can catch it.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.810
No, Neil,
what have I told you?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.681
I'm done hauling ass.

29:30.725 --> 29:34.207
From now on, I'm putting my ass
in the hands of the people.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.470
[Laughter]

29:36.513 --> 29:38.733
You talk a big game,
but I know you, man.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.822
The second you start a game
of ultimate hide and seek

29:40.866 --> 29:42.432
or see
that ice cream truck,

29:42.476 --> 29:44.434
you won't be able
to help yourself.

29:44.478 --> 29:48.395
Kevin McRoberts --
He Can't Help Himself.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.223
You know what, Neil?

29:50.266 --> 29:51.528
Maybe you're right.

29:51.572 --> 29:53.269
Let's play
ultimate hide and go seek.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.315
You hide first.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.620
Yes.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.405
Oh.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.842
Start counting to 3,000,
buddy.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.062
[Laughter]

30:03.105 --> 30:05.847
We shoulda started doing
that 10 years ago.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.023
Oh!
There she is.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.459
Our first lady.

30:09.503 --> 30:12.071
Just in time
for your big moment.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.812
Oh. Oh.

30:13.855 --> 30:17.903
You just stand right here,
and look the way you do.

30:17.946 --> 30:21.080
You know,
in my photography days,

30:21.123 --> 30:22.690
we'd call that
"camera meat."

30:22.733 --> 30:24.910
What photography days?

30:24.953 --> 30:26.868
I was a Boston Paparazzo.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.697
Oh, is that why you got punched
in the face by James Taylor?

30:29.740 --> 30:31.307
[Laughter]

30:31.351 --> 30:34.397
No.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.922
Hey, aren't those the cops
from the Vic House?

30:36.965 --> 30:38.358
Oh. Yeah.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.533
Kept in touch with them
after my trouncing

30:39.576 --> 30:41.665
of Sean Avery.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.363
And we have Mr. Harrison,

30:43.406 --> 30:46.583
who donated
quite handsomely, too.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.890
Buncha people
from the neighborhood.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.719
Everybody showed
for your boy!

30:51.762 --> 30:55.897
[Cheers and applause]

30:55.941 --> 30:56.898
Oh, here we go.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.292
Ready?
And smile.

30:59.335 --> 31:00.467
Thanks, Kevin.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.686
Mrs. McRoberts.
Looks great.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.558
Oh.
God, look at us.

31:04.601 --> 31:05.907
It's perfect.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.257
Like JFK and Jackie O.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.607
But poor.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.827
But that means
I get a Marilyn!

31:12.871 --> 31:14.437
[Laughs]

31:17.832 --> 31:19.399
[Line ringing]

31:19.442 --> 31:20.313
Patty: What? [Beeps]

31:20.356 --> 31:22.141
[Groans]

31:23.403 --> 31:26.275
[Muffled cheering]

31:26.319 --> 31:28.016
You okay?
Jesus!

31:28.060 --> 31:29.800
Sorry.Yeah, you should be!

31:29.844 --> 31:31.628
Whoa.What -- What the hell
were you thinking,

31:31.672 --> 31:32.847
offering this place?

31:32.891 --> 31:35.241
Oh, it seemed easier
than saying no.

31:35.284 --> 31:38.331
Sam, you can't give
into him like that, okay?

31:38.374 --> 31:39.767
It's what he's counting on.Counting on?

31:39.810 --> 31:41.856
He's not exactly
a puppet master, okay?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.423
It's Kevin.

31:43.466 --> 31:47.340
Sam, "it's Kevin" is why
he gets away with everything.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.558
It's why he always wins.

31:48.602 --> 31:49.951
You say that
like it's destined.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.692
It is!

31:51.735 --> 31:53.215
This whole world is designed
for guys like Kevin

31:53.259 --> 31:54.956
and Pete and Neil!

31:55.000 --> 31:58.568
I don't know that it's --Sam, he shot someone.

31:58.612 --> 32:01.223
Kevin shot someone
in our home,

32:01.267 --> 32:02.659
and the cops
couldn't care less.

32:02.703 --> 32:05.184
They're in there toasting him
right now.

32:05.227 --> 32:07.751
This whole game is rigged!
Fixed!

32:07.795 --> 32:09.840
And I-I should just give up,
you know?

32:09.884 --> 32:13.409
I should -- Why not?
I should just give up...

32:13.453 --> 32:16.195
and run away with you.

32:16.238 --> 32:19.024
You know, we could go to, like,
a lake town or a desert,

32:19.067 --> 32:21.852
where we could be
totally different people.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.203
I could be, like...

32:24.246 --> 32:26.205
Denise, and, uh,

32:26.248 --> 32:29.164
Denise makes her own bowls and
remembers to water her plants.

32:32.863 --> 32:35.431
What?

32:35.475 --> 32:38.260
Being with me
is giving up?

32:38.304 --> 32:41.481
That's not what I --

32:41.524 --> 32:44.223
Right now,
it seems like the right answer.

32:44.266 --> 32:47.617
It seems like it,
but it's not?

32:53.884 --> 32:56.148
I'm offering you
something real.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.019
Something...

32:58.063 --> 33:00.065
[Sighs]

33:00.108 --> 33:04.025
You just don't know
how to help yourself, do you?

33:05.157 --> 33:07.376
Oh, right, being
with you is gonna, what?

33:07.420 --> 33:08.464
It's gonna save me?

33:08.508 --> 33:09.944
It'd be an improvement.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.207
Oh. Okay.

33:12.251 --> 33:14.905
Um, you know, Kevin --
when we met,

33:14.949 --> 33:16.907
he got me out
of my parents' house,

33:16.951 --> 33:19.127
because he insisted that we move
in together after two months,

33:19.171 --> 33:21.695
and, so, I guess
I let him save me, too.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.262
I'm not Kevin.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.307
No, I know.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.961
But you know that there
are people who look at me

33:27.005 --> 33:29.485
and they don't see
a charity case?

33:29.529 --> 33:32.140
Who like me like this?

33:32.184 --> 33:34.751
Like this?

33:34.795 --> 33:37.537
Come on, you know you deserve
better than this place,

33:37.580 --> 33:40.105
than those idiots.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.932
You could be...

33:41.976 --> 33:43.456
more.

33:43.499 --> 33:46.067
â™ª

33:46.111 --> 33:48.504
That's not a compliment.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.376
God, I used to think
it was,

33:50.419 --> 33:54.293
but I am so done
with trying to be more.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.860
This is it.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.471
This should be enough.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.082
â™ª

34:01.126 --> 34:02.127
[Line ringing]

34:02.170 --> 34:04.433
Patty: What? [Beeps]

34:04.477 --> 34:09.177
â™ª

34:09.221 --> 34:10.961
Oh, Jumping Jehoshaphat.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.485
Licking Lucifer.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.313
[Laughter]

34:16.141 --> 34:18.969
[Laughter]

34:19.013 --> 34:22.364
Uh, whoa there.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.801
Is this Fun Allison
rearing her ugly head?

34:24.845 --> 34:28.631
I thought she drowned in that
water park eight years ago.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.157
Babe, cool it.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.507
That is not very
Jackie O behavior.

34:34.550 --> 34:38.337
Yeah, take a page out of
her book and drink alone.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.948
You have,
like, an image now.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.516
You gotta act like
a politician's wife.

34:43.559 --> 34:45.126
Don't you have
a public image?

34:45.170 --> 34:46.475
Uh, yeah.

34:46.519 --> 34:47.824
I'm living it right now.

34:47.868 --> 34:49.826
I'm a man of the people.

34:49.870 --> 34:54.309
[Cheers and applause]

34:54.353 --> 34:56.529
[Laughter]

34:57.312 --> 35:01.229
I know you think
you're some everyday hero...

35:02.796 --> 35:05.146
but you're just a dick,
Kevin.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.200
Everyday Hero.

35:15.243 --> 35:18.420
I like the sound of that.

35:18.464 --> 35:22.642
Kevin,
that's your campaign slogan!

35:22.685 --> 35:26.863
"Kevin McRoberts --
Everyday Hero."

35:26.907 --> 35:27.864
[Laughter]

35:27.908 --> 35:30.084
It's brilliant!
[Laughs]

35:30.128 --> 35:31.477
Cheers, everybody!

35:31.520 --> 35:33.783
Both: Everyday Hero!

35:33.827 --> 35:35.350
[Cheers and applause]

35:35.394 --> 35:40.225
[Cellphone vibrates]

35:40.268 --> 35:42.357
I told you,
I'm off tonight.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.925
[Door opens]

35:48.407 --> 35:50.060
[Bell dings]

35:50.104 --> 35:56.893
â™ª

35:56.937 --> 35:59.113
Bram, if you call again,

35:59.157 --> 36:01.289
I'm making you shovel
my walk all winter.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.428
Uh, Patty stepped out
to grab some cigarettes.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.386
Oh.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.040
Sounds familiar.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.871
I can leave her a message
if you want.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.655
Uh...

36:19.699 --> 36:21.135
I -- Well -- You --

36:21.179 --> 36:23.659
Sorry, you're --
you're Officer Ridgeway, right?

36:23.703 --> 36:26.662
Are you here to question
her again, or...

36:26.706 --> 36:29.796
No.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.102
Oh. Um...

36:32.146 --> 36:35.671
I just heard about the break-in,
so I thought I should stop by.

36:35.715 --> 36:38.935
See if I can bring her
a roast chicken or something.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.937
The break-in
was next door.

36:40.981 --> 36:44.724
No, I know, but it's still
pretty traumatic.

36:44.767 --> 36:47.074
Mm, she seems fine.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.945
Good, even.

36:48.989 --> 36:51.644
Actually [Chuckles]
you could say

36:51.687 --> 36:53.385
it's the happiest she's been
in years.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.474
â™ª

36:55.517 --> 36:58.128
[Scoffs]

36:58.172 --> 37:00.261
Well, good for her.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.440
[Sighs]

37:05.484 --> 37:07.660
But you know, actually,
the weirdest thing happened.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.488
I --

37:09.531 --> 37:13.405
When I heard about the break-in,
I wasn't totally surprised.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.581
Since we broke up, I've had
all these questions, you know?

37:15.624 --> 37:17.322
I-I guess I should've been
asking them all along,

37:17.365 --> 37:22.152
but the more I think about
what those questions would be,

37:22.196 --> 37:26.113
the less I think
she'd ever answer them.

37:26.156 --> 37:28.333
But hey, maybe you'll
have more luck.

37:28.376 --> 37:29.943
I'm not a cop, so...

37:29.986 --> 37:38.299
â™ª

37:38.343 --> 37:46.873
â™ª

37:49.441 --> 37:50.964
[Line ringing]

37:51.007 --> 37:53.358
Patty: What? [Beeps]

37:53.401 --> 37:56.361
Patty,
please call me back.

37:56.404 --> 37:57.927
Please.

37:57.971 --> 38:01.453
â™ª

38:01.496 --> 38:04.151
[Door opens]

38:05.413 --> 38:07.197
Hey.

38:07.241 --> 38:08.721
You waiting for me?
I've been trying to call you.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.897
I saw.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.682
But I wanted to yell at you
in person.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.989
No, don't.

38:16.032 --> 38:19.993
I am --
I am so sorry.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.125
Do you even know
what you're apologizing for?

38:26.086 --> 38:28.218
Then it doesn't count!Okay.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.524
Well, what did I do?

38:29.568 --> 38:31.352
Why are you yelling?Because.

38:33.441 --> 38:36.792
Because it sucked
what you asked me to do.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.797
With Tammy.

38:41.841 --> 38:44.060
Okay.

38:44.104 --> 38:48.369
Okay, you're right.
I-I am sorry.

38:48.413 --> 38:52.068
But I didn't think of it
as a big ask, you know?

38:52.112 --> 38:53.461
You pistol whipped
a trucker for me,

38:53.505 --> 38:56.638
so you understand
if I, you know,

38:56.682 --> 38:58.466
didn't think it would drain
the favor bank

38:58.510 --> 39:00.947
asking you to look
in a friend's purse.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.557
Allison...

39:04.559 --> 39:07.562
you know.

39:07.606 --> 39:08.433
I know what?

39:08.476 --> 39:12.262
You know, okay?

39:12.306 --> 39:14.874
You know that Tammy is not
just some friend,

39:14.917 --> 39:17.093
and you know why you shouldn't
have asked me to do that.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.704
Well, you never actually
said anything,

39:18.747 --> 39:20.096
and I didn't want
to just assume.

39:20.140 --> 39:24.057
Bullshit! You knew.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.580
And you framed Nick
for me,

39:25.624 --> 39:27.365
not out of the kindness
of your heart,

39:27.408 --> 39:30.237
but you did it so that when you
asked me to betray Tammy,

39:30.280 --> 39:31.412
I'd owe you one.

39:31.456 --> 39:32.892
Okay, that is not true.

39:32.935 --> 39:35.416
And also, "betray her"
is a little strong.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.419
You knew I wouldn't say no,
not to you.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.421
Oh, God.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.423
Did you actually look
in her notebook?

39:42.467 --> 39:44.469
Yes.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.340
And I hate myself for it.

39:49.996 --> 39:52.259
Uh, what did it say?Jesus, Allison!

39:54.522 --> 39:55.915
It said nothing.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.525
I did it for nothing.

39:57.569 --> 39:59.222
She doesn't think that
you want your husband dead.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.616
She thinks we talk too much.
She's jealous.

40:01.660 --> 40:05.054
She called you "meek"
and a "victim."

40:05.098 --> 40:06.665
Clearly,
she doesn't know you.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.144
Okay.

40:08.188 --> 40:10.103
But I can't take back
what I did.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.890
She's the only person
that I have,

40:14.934 --> 40:17.893
and you used it.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.460
You ruined it.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.028
I'm sorry, Tammy's the only
person that you have?

40:22.071 --> 40:23.159
That's a rude thing
to say.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.726
Be rude, Allison.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.467
At least rude is being shitty
out in the open.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.774
Okay. Well, sorry for asking
for your help.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.123
Jesus,
I thought I could.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.125
You know,
isn't that what we do?

40:32.168 --> 40:33.779
We've both done
terrible things,

40:33.822 --> 40:36.869
but we've done them
for each other.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.174
You know, at this point,

40:38.218 --> 40:42.091
I couldn't even tell you
who's done what.

40:42.135 --> 40:45.181
You're the one who tried
to kill her husband.

40:45.225 --> 40:47.183
And you're the one
who helped.

40:47.227 --> 40:48.707
And it was a bust.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.578
So...

40:50.622 --> 40:53.668
clearly, you're better off
with a different accomplice.

40:53.712 --> 40:57.890
Hey, I don't want you around
'cause you're a good accomplice.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.893
You've -- You've raised me
from the dead.

41:00.936 --> 41:04.157
Like, after all this,
you're gonna le--

41:04.200 --> 41:05.898
Without you...

41:07.247 --> 41:08.640
[Huffs]

41:08.683 --> 41:10.424
You're...

41:15.124 --> 41:16.343
What?

41:16.386 --> 41:22.697
â™ª

41:22.741 --> 41:24.699
Ugh.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.135
Okay. Yeah.

41:26.179 --> 41:27.441
You know what?
Never mind.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.964
Never mind.
I'm not gonna ask you for help.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.270
I'm not gonna ask you
for anything.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.011
So, let's just go back
to how it was.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.535
I'll get you a beer, and you'll
say, "Oh, it's not cold enough,"

41:34.579 --> 41:36.232
and that will be the extent
of our sharing, okay?

41:36.276 --> 41:39.148
So, let's just go back
to how it was.

41:39.192 --> 41:40.759
Fine.
Fine.

41:40.802 --> 41:43.718
â™ª

41:51.944 --> 41:54.990
Neil: How dare you?

41:55.034 --> 41:56.731
Oh.

41:56.775 --> 41:59.560
[Laughter]

42:03.782 --> 42:04.957
That's right.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.395
I heard everything.

42:08.438 --> 42:09.570
I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.267
What do you think
I'm talking about?

42:11.311 --> 42:12.617
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about

42:12.660 --> 42:14.967
unless you know
what you're talking about.

42:15.010 --> 42:16.185
I know
what I'm talking about,

42:16.229 --> 42:17.491
and I know
what you talked about,

42:17.535 --> 42:20.450
and therefore,
what I'm talking about.

42:20.494 --> 42:23.584
Well, now I definitely don't
know what you're talking about.

42:23.628 --> 42:26.195
Please, Allison,
being sardined in the closet

42:26.239 --> 42:28.633
for four hours may cut off
circulation in some places,

42:28.676 --> 42:31.287
but it doesn't
affect my hearing.

42:31.331 --> 42:33.507
Neil, it's not
what you think.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.509
I've been losing feeling
in my left leg

42:35.553 --> 42:37.555
thinking Kevin
was over me,

42:37.598 --> 42:41.167
that I'd hide and he would
never seek me ever again.

42:41.210 --> 42:42.995
[Laughter]

42:43.038 --> 42:46.302
But I think I know how to
get back in his good graces.

42:46.346 --> 42:48.000
No, Neil, don't.Hey, that's my phone.

42:48.043 --> 42:49.131
Stop!
Give me that!

42:49.175 --> 42:50.350
No, stop!Give me my phone.

42:50.393 --> 42:51.264
Hey, that's not yours!
Give it to me!

42:51.307 --> 42:52.395
Ahh!
Give me my phone!

42:52.439 --> 42:54.180
No, stop! Ahh!

42:54.223 --> 42:56.486
[Grunting]

42:56.530 --> 42:58.619

43:04.016 --> 43:09.064
â™ª

43:09.108 --> 43:12.546
What the fuck?!

43:12.590 --> 43:14.635
You're not gonna tell
Kevin anything.

43:14.679 --> 43:19.422
â™ª

43:19.466 --> 43:20.989
You okay?

43:21.033 --> 43:26.691
â™ª

43:26.734 --> 43:28.606
I'm fine.

43:28.649 --> 43:36.962
