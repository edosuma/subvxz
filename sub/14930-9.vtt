WEBVTT

00:04.772 --> 00:07.241
GOOD MORNING,
UNCLE EDDIE.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.509
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

00:08.542 --> 00:10.744
I'M TRYING TO COME UP
WITH SOME NEW JOKES
FOR MY ACT TONIGHT.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.514
OH! WHAT DO YOU GOT
SO FAR?

00:14.148 --> 00:17.551
THANK YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.652
GOOD TO BE HERE. GOOD--
HACK.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.822
HOW HARD CAN IT BE
TO COME UP WITH
A COUPLE OF JOKES?

00:21.855 --> 00:25.126
YOU KNOW,
SOME COMEDIANS WORK
THEIR WHOLE LIVES

00:25.159 --> 00:26.827
JUST TO COME UP WITH
A TIGHT 5 MINUTES.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.598
WELL, MAYBE I COULD
HELP YOU COME UP
WITH SOME STUFF.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.466
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

00:32.500 --> 00:35.569
OK, LET'S SEE. UM...

00:35.603 --> 00:38.239
HA HA. HA HA HA!

00:38.272 --> 00:40.408
SAUSAGE.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.076
SAUSAGE?

00:42.110 --> 00:45.213
IT'S FUNNY! SAUSAG--

00:45.246 --> 00:48.182
SAUSAGE IS FUNNY.
WRITE IT DOWN.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.085
I'M NOT WRITING IT DOWN.
IT'S JUST A WORD, OK?

00:51.119 --> 00:54.088
A JOKE NEEDS CONTEXT.
YOU CAN'T, YOU KNOW,

00:54.122 --> 00:57.425
JUST GO SAY, "SAUSAGE"
IN A VACUUM.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.731
SAUSAGE IN A VACUUM
IS FUNNY!

01:03.764 --> 01:06.634
SEE YOU LATER.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.202
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

01:08.236 --> 01:09.203
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

01:09.237 --> 01:11.405
I SHOULDN'T
GO OUT IN PUBLIC
LOOKING LIKE THIS?

01:11.439 --> 01:12.506
NO, BABY, YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL--

01:12.540 --> 01:14.742
FINE, FINE!
YOU GO TO THE STORE!

01:14.775 --> 01:17.145
I'LL JUST BE A SHUT-IN!

01:19.247 --> 01:20.248
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

01:20.281 --> 01:23.817
YOU KNOW, I GUESS
IT'S THAT TIME
OF THE PREGNANCY

01:23.851 --> 01:26.887
WHEN CLAUDIA
DOESN'T EXACTLY
FEEL...

01:26.920 --> 01:27.755
SEXY.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.191
DO YOU THINK I HAVE
BARNEY RUBBLE FEET?

01:30.224 --> 01:34.462
IF ANYTHING,
THEY'RE LIKE POINTS.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.432
OW! GOD, THAT'S LIKE
A NEEDLE!

01:38.466 --> 01:39.367
AAH!

01:39.400 --> 01:41.169
LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.870
OH...THANK YOU.

01:42.903 --> 01:46.407
HEY, I SAW ROSEMARY
MINERO DOWN AT
THE FLOWER SHOP.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.842
YOU THINK YOU LOOK
PREGNANT. SHE--

01:48.876 --> 01:50.010
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:50.043 --> 01:53.381
NOTHING, IT'S JUST
COMPARED TO ROSEMARY,
THAT YOU LOOK--

01:53.414 --> 01:56.184
OH, THANK YOU.
SO I'M NOT QUITE
AS REPELLENT

01:56.217 --> 01:59.487
AS THE MOST PREGNANT
WOMAN ON EARTH!

02:00.721 --> 02:02.756
BABY, YOU UP?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.258
YEAH.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.260
YOU WANT SOME LOVIN', HMM?

02:06.294 --> 02:08.262
NO.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.232
ARE YOU OK?

02:17.571 --> 02:18.939
WELL, I THINK
SHE LOOKS GREAT.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.176
YEAH, SO DO I,
BUT NO MATTER
WHAT I DO,

02:22.210 --> 02:23.911
I CAN'T MAKE HER
FEEL ANY BETTER.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.347
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL
MAKE HER REALLY HAPPY?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.381
A POLICE SCANNER.

02:27.415 --> 02:30.484
WHY WOULD
A PREGNANT WOMAN
NEED A POLICE SCANNER?

02:30.518 --> 02:33.887
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT 3 OF 'EM
IN MY TRUNK.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.324
THEY'RE NOT MOVIN'
AT ALL.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.526
HEY, LIL.
HEY, BABY.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.694
I'M HERE
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

02:40.728 --> 02:41.962
J

02:41.995 --> 02:43.964
I GOT SOME GREAT
NEWS.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.233
WHAT?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.534
YOU'RE A SCIENCENAUT!

02:46.567 --> 02:48.302
NO, I'M NOT.

02:48.336 --> 02:51.272
YEAH! YEAH,
YES, YOU ARE.
I GOT YOU IN!

02:51.305 --> 02:54.308
HERE. HERE'S YOUR
JACKET...

02:54.342 --> 02:55.943
WHAT IS "M DWARF"?

02:55.976 --> 02:58.379
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S A LOW MASS
STAR.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.413
IT'S JIMMY'S
PLEBE NAME.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.615
WHEN YOU'RE
A FULL NAUT, YOU CAN
CHOOSE YOUR OWN.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.850
I DON'T WANT--
YOU DO AS YOU'RE TOLD,
PLEBE!

03:02.883 --> 03:07.521
OK. I GOTTA GO. I'LL
SEE YOU AT THE SCIENCE
LAB AT 1600 HOURS.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.389
DON'T BE LATE.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.392
BRAD, SERIOUSLY--
PLEBE!!

03:14.995 --> 03:17.498
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
"M DWARF"!

03:17.531 --> 03:19.400
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

03:19.433 --> 03:22.570
IT'S ALL HE'S BEEN
TALKING ABOUT
FOR THE LAST MONTH.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.972
I'M NOT EVEN INTO
SCIENCE.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.039
SURE, YOU ARE.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.908
YOU'VE GOT THAT WHOLE
WEATHER KIT UP
IN YOUR ROOM.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.244
LILY,
THAT'S A HUMIDIFIER.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.280
JUST TELL
YOUR BOYFRIEND

03:32.313 --> 03:33.781
I'M NOT JOINING
HIS STUPID CLUB.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.550
NO, COME ON.
YOU SAW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO HIM.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.785
JUST GO TO ONE
MEETING.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.421
NO. I GOTTA KEEP
MY SCHEDULE OPEN
AFTER SCHOOL.

03:40.454 --> 03:44.325
WHAT IF
SOMETHING COMES UP?
WHAT IF I GET A DATE?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.262
OK. FINE.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.264
I'LL GO TO ONE MEETING.

03:50.298 --> 03:53.401
OK. I'M SURE BRAD
WILL APPRECIATE IT.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.304
PLEBE!

04:13.020 --> 04:16.790
HEY, UNCLE EDDIE.
OOH! HOW WAS YOUR
COMEDY THING LAST NIGHT?

04:16.824 --> 04:19.493
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY
I KILLED!

04:19.527 --> 04:21.995
YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE?
SAUSAGE.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.065
IT'S TOO CONFIDENT.
WHO DOES IT THINK IT IS?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.767
I'LL TELL YOU
WHO IT IS.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.871
IT'S ALL THIS OTHER CRAP
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER EAT
BY ITSELF...

04:30.904 --> 04:34.575
GROUND UP, STUFFED
INSIDE AN INTESTINE!

04:34.608 --> 04:35.509
IT'S NOT EVEN MEAT.

04:35.543 --> 04:38.312
IT SITS ON THE PLATE
GOING, "COME ON, EAT ME.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.014
EAT ME. YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.
YOU KNOW I'M GOOD."

04:41.048 --> 04:44.017
IT'S LIKE, HEY, LISTEN, MAN,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MEAT.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.953
IT'S HALFWAY BETWEEN
FOOD AND GARBAGE.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.821
I FEEL LIKE TAKING
THE SAUSAGE AND SAYING,

04:47.855 --> 04:52.560
"HEY, SAUSAGE, ENOUGH
WITH THE ATTITUDE,
ALL RIGHT"

04:54.362 --> 04:56.864
THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.099
HEY, REALLY FUNNY
STUFF.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.033
THANK YOU.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.770
KELLY GREEN.
I M.C. OVER AT
THE COMIC STRIP.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.937
OH, YEAH.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.739
YOU WANNA COME OVER
AND DO A SPOT ON MY
LINEUP THURSDAY?

05:05.773 --> 05:09.076
IF I DON'T HAVE TO
EAT ANY SAUSAGE,
I'LL BE THERE.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.579
WOW! YOU GOT YOUR
FIRST BIG GIG.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.114
HMM. SEE? I TOLD YOU
SAUSAGE WAS FUNNY.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.248
SAUSAGE ISN'T FUNNY.

05:15.282 --> 05:18.952
A PISSED OFF GUY
PUTTING SAUSAGE
IN ITS PLACE IS FUNNY.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.922
OK, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.692
WE GOTTA COME UP WITH
SOME MORE MATERIAL.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.426
THAT'S OK. I'M GOOD.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.696
NO, NO, NO. I GOT
SOMETHING NEW.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.033
FUTONS.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.570
WHAT? IT'S FUNNY.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.571
HEY.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.439
HI.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.641
EDDIE, THIS IS STEVE
FROM MY ECON CLASS.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.075
HOW YOU DOIN'?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.412
OK, IF WE INCREASE
MONEY SUPPLY,

05:44.445 --> 05:49.016
THAT HAS THE SAME
EFFECT AS LOWERING
INTEREST RATES.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.487
DO I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY FACE?

05:53.521 --> 05:54.422
NO.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.623
WHY ARE YOU
STARING AT ME?

05:55.656 --> 05:59.893
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO
BEAUTIFUL. I MEAN,
YOUR SKIN IS AMAZING.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.565
THANK YOU. I TRY
TO STAY OUT OF THE SUN

06:04.598 --> 06:08.168
AND I EXFOLIATE
WHEN I HAVE TOO MUCH...

06:08.201 --> 06:09.069
FOLIAGE.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.071
MAY I ASK YOUR AGE?

06:11.104 --> 06:14.074
STEVE, THAT IS
A DANGEROUS GAME.

06:14.107 --> 06:14.842
23.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.744
WHICH YOU JUST WON.

06:16.777 --> 06:21.415
CLAUDIA, HOW'S THAT BABY
MY BROTHER PUT INSIDE YOU?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.017
FINE, EDDIE.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.620
I WAS JUST CHECKING.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.657
HEY, SEAN,
JUST A HEAD'S-UP.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.960
THERE'S AN ENGLISH GUY
IN THE KITCHEN
HITTIN' ON YOUR WIFE.

06:32.993 --> 06:33.994
OH, YEAH. THAT'S COOL.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.596
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET A LOOK AT HIM.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.799
HE'S KIND OF A CROSS
BETWEEN YOU AND JUDE
LAW, MINUS YOU.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.802
YEAH, WELL, IS HE
MAKING HER FEEL SEXY?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.637
HE WAS MAKIN' ME
FEEL SEXY.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.105
ALL RIGHT, GOOD, SEE?

06:45.138 --> 06:47.841
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.076
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN'
ABOUT?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.277
REMEMBER HOW I SAID

06:50.310 --> 06:53.514
CLAUDIA HASN'T REALLY
BEEN FEELING THAT
ATTRACTIVE LATELY?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.616
I DECIDED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.118
HI. DOES CLAUDIA
FINNERTY LIVE HERE?

06:58.151 --> 07:01.188
YEAH. YEAH.
I'M HER HUSBAND SEAN.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.691
HI, I'M STEVE.
I'M HERE TO STUDY

07:03.724 --> 07:06.994
OH, HEY, STEVE,
HOW'S IT GOING?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.101
THANKS. I'M GONNA
GO INSIDE, OK?

07:14.134 --> 07:18.205
ONE SECOND.
I WANNA ASK YOU
SOMETHING, STEVE.

07:18.238 --> 07:18.972
UH...

07:19.006 --> 07:22.142
YOU FIND MY WIFE
PRETTY ATTRACTIVE?

07:22.175 --> 07:24.077
I GUESS.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.278
YEAH, SURE, I DO.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.881
I THINK SHE'S
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.249
OH, GOOD.
I'M GLAD FOR YOU.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.952
I AM, TOO. I'M LUCKY.
YEAH.

07:31.985 --> 07:35.188
I WANT YOU TO
HIT ON HER FOR ME.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.123
WHAT?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.057
JUST HIT ON HER,

07:37.090 --> 07:39.159
MAKE HER FEEL SEXY,
ATTRACTIVE,

07:39.192 --> 07:41.228
AN INTERNATIONAL STUD
LIKE YOU, YOU CAN
DO THAT, HUH?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.931
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA
BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.133
WHAT IF I PAID YOU
50 BUCKS?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.636
SEAN, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YA,

07:48.669 --> 07:51.071
YOU DON'T PAY OTHER GUYS
TO HIT ON YOUR WIFE.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.907
LOOK, I'VE BEEN WITH
CLAUDIA FOR 16 YEARS,
OK?

07:53.941 --> 07:55.976
I THINK I KNOW HER
BETTER THAN YOU DO.

07:56.009 --> 08:00.981
I THINK PRETTY BOY'S
GONNA GET TO KNOW HER
BETTER THAN BOTH OF US.

08:03.016 --> 08:03.951
JIMMY, HEY,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.687
HOW'D YOUR FIRST
SCIENCENAUTS MEETING

08:06.720 --> 08:10.057

08:14.762 --> 08:17.665
CAREFUL, NIMROD.
YOU'RE GONNA BURN
DOWN THE SCHOOL.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.232
HELIUM'S INERT,
YOU IDIOT.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.168
NOT IN A NUCLEAR
REACTOR, DUMB ASS.

08:21.201 --> 08:25.305
WELL, I DON'T SEE
A CYCLOTRON AROUND
HERE, NOW, DO YOU?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.141
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
A CYCLOTRON, ALL RIGHT.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.309
Chanting:
ARGUMENT, ARGUMENT!

08:29.342 --> 08:32.145
FELLAS, NO NEED
TO ARGUE. LET'S JUST
GET THIS CLEANED UP.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.782
"M DWARF, SOLAR WIND,"
WE NEED A CLEAN-UP!

08:34.815 --> 08:40.654
Chanting: PLEBES,
PLEBES, PLEBES, PLEBES!

08:40.688 --> 08:45.325
PLEBES, PLEBES, PLEBES,
PLEBES, PLEBES, PLEBES...

08:45.358 --> 08:47.661
WOW! SORRY, JIM.
I DIDN'T REALIZE

08:47.695 --> 08:50.864
YOU'D HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THAT MUCH
DORKERY.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.833
YEAH. IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.835
WELL, THANKS FOR
GIVING IT A SHOT.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.037
IT'S OK. THERE'S ANOTHER
MEETING TOMORROW.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.239
IF I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING,
I MIGHT SWING BY.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.576
REALLY? THAT WOULD MEAN
SO MUCH TO BRAD.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.778
THANK YOU, PUBE.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.280
IT'S PLEBE!

09:08.281 --> 09:09.950
WANNA TALK ABOUT
THE MEETING?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.052
NOT REALLY.
IT WAS JUST LAME.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.654
COME ON, JIM.
I WENT TO THAT SCHOOL.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.322
I KNOW WHAT GOES ON
AT THOSE MEETINGS.

09:15.355 --> 09:18.225
OH!

09:19.627 --> 09:21.729

09:43.250 --> 09:47.287
Woman: PERMISSION

CAPTAIN ROCKHARD.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.689
Captain: GR-ANTED.

09:48.722 --> 09:52.159
MY SPACE SUIT
IS WAY TOO HOT.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.796
LET ME HELP YOU,
LIEUTENANT HO.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.632
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

09:58.666 --> 10:01.401
ZERO GRAVITY.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.235
NICE!

10:02.269 --> 10:04.772
THAT'S JUST WRONG.
YOU JUST SAID YOU--

10:04.805 --> 10:09.109
YOU GOTTA STOP FALLING
FOR "I KNOW WHAT GOES ON
AT THOSE MEETINGS."

10:10.911 --> 10:14.181
SO HOW DO YOU GET IT
TO BOUNCE LIKE THAT?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.415
'SCUSE ME?

10:15.448 --> 10:16.850
YOUR HAIR.
IT'S SO BOUNCY.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.251
HOW DO YOU GET IT
TO DO THAT?

10:18.285 --> 10:21.021
I WASH IT
AND THEN I WALK.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.390
HEY, GUYS,
HOW'S THE STUDYING GOING?

10:23.423 --> 10:26.259
IT'S GOOD. YEAH.
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.627
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

10:27.661 --> 10:30.964
YEAH. WE'RE GONNA GET
A CUP OF COFFEE THEN
GO BACK TO STEVE'S PLACE.

10:30.998 --> 10:31.699
REALLY?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.767
YEAH. MY ROOMMATE'S
OUT OF TOWN,

10:33.801 --> 10:35.368
SO IT'LL BE
PRETTY QUIET.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.070
OH! OK. YOU
COMING BACK SOON?

10:37.104 --> 10:41.441
NO. NOT FOR A WHILE.
WE GOT A LOTTA STUFF
TO GET DONE. SEE YA.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.311
S-SEE YA LATER,
BABE. Bye.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.449
DO I HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THIS?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.419
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.988
I FORGOT MY BOOKS!

10:58.926 --> 10:59.727
OH, HEY, EDDIE.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.295
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
ALL DRESSED UP FOR?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.230
STUDYING.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.166
ALL RIGHT, THAT DRESS
DOES NOT SAY STUDYING,

11:06.199 --> 11:07.434
ALL RIGHT?

11:07.467 --> 11:10.771
IT SAYS, "LET ME JUST
RUN YOUR CREDIT CARD
THROUGH THE AGENCY,

11:10.804 --> 11:13.073
AND WE'LL GET STARTED."

11:13.106 --> 11:15.008
SO WHAT'S WITH
THE GETUP?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.745
I FOUND OUT HOW BIG
OF AN ASS YOUR BROTHER IS.

11:17.778 --> 11:21.081
OK, ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
ABOUT TRADE EMBARGOES?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.951
JUST ONE.
HAVE YOU EVER MODELED?

11:23.984 --> 11:26.353
NO. I HAVE NEVER
MODELED.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.654
I AM NOT A DANCER,

11:27.687 --> 11:30.257
AND NO ONE HAS EVER
TOLD ME I LOOK LIKE
A YOUNG JESSICA SIMPSON.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.060
CAN WE PLEASE
GET BACK TO STUDYING?

11:33.093 --> 11:33.894
SORRY.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.096
NOW, THE EFFECTS
THAT NASA HAS ON THE--

11:36.129 --> 11:38.031
NOW YOU'RE HOLDING
MY HAND.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.166
WHAT, DOES THAT
BOTHER YOU?

11:39.199 --> 11:41.935
NOT NEARLY AS MUCH
AS WHAT YOU'RE DOING
WITH YOUR FOOT.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.236
WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.739
I JUST FIND YOU
REALLY SEXY.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.741
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT
I'M NOT FLATTERED

11:47.775 --> 11:52.112
BY YOUR CONSTANT
COMPLIMENTING AND OGLING
AND...FOOTING

11:52.145 --> 11:55.448
BUT I AM MARRIED, OK?
SO, I'M SORRY. WE CAN'T
DO THIS ANYMORE.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.384
NO, NO, WAIT.
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.788
OH, RIGHT, IT'S MY FAULT
'CAUSE I'M SO IRRESISTIBLE,
RIGHT?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.856
NO, NO. IT WAS
YOUR HUSBAND'S FAULT.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.125
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.395
HE PAID ME
TO HIT ON YOU

12:08.428 --> 12:11.364
AND MAKE YOU FEEL
SEXY.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.499
WHAT?

12:12.532 --> 12:16.236
I JUST REALLY
NEEDED THE MONEY.
SOMEONE STOLE MY BIKE.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.471
MY HUSBAND PAID YOU
TO HIT ON ME?

12:18.505 --> 12:21.909
YEAH. IT WAS REALLY
AWKWARD.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.381
OK. UM, STEVE,

12:28.415 --> 12:29.716
THE NEXT TIME
WE SEE MY HUSBAND,

12:29.749 --> 12:34.254
I WANT YOU TO HIT ON ME
LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER HIT
ON ANYONE BEFORE.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.388
OK, NOW THIS IS
GETTING WEIRD.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.025
NO, IT'S NOT WEIRD AT ALL.
YOU JUST NEED TO
STAY PRETTY

12:38.058 --> 12:40.794
AND WEAR SOMETHING
THAT'S EASY TO TAKE OFF,
OK?

12:40.828 --> 12:41.661
I'LL DO THE REST.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.463
GOOD PLAN.
SO WHAT'S IN IT
FOR THE KID?

12:43.496 --> 12:46.133
HE GETS TO HIT ON ME
AND PASS ECON.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.837
AND I'M BUYIN' HIM
A BIKE.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.073
OH, HEY, UNCLE EDDIE.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.908
HOW'D YOU BIT GO
LAST NIGHT?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.243
DID YOU KILL?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.979
SOMETHING DIED.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.949
YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE?
HOT DOGS.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.284
THEY'RE TOO CONFIDENT.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.253
WHO DO THEY THINK
THEY ARE?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.487
I'LL TELL YOU
WHO THEY ARE.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.990
IT'S ALL THAT CRAP
YOU'D NEVER EAT,

13:10.023 --> 13:12.592
GROUND UP AND STUFFED
INTO INTESTINES.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.295
YET THEY SIT THERE
ON THE PLATE LIKE,
"COME EAT ME!

13:15.328 --> 13:16.997
YOU KNOW YOU WANNA EAT ME!"

13:17.030 --> 13:19.066
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
REAL MEAT!

13:19.099 --> 13:22.169
YOU'RE HALFWAY BETWEEN
FOOD AND GARBAGE.

13:22.202 --> 13:26.806
HEY, HOT DOGS,
EASY ON THE ATTITUDE.
WE GET IT!

13:28.175 --> 13:29.176
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT!

13:29.209 --> 13:31.979
I'M GONNA BRING ON
YOUR NEXT COMIC.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.148
THIS GUY'S ALMOST
AS CONFIDENT AS A HOT DOG.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.117
RIGHT FROM THE ISLE
OF STATEN,

13:37.150 --> 13:40.353
LET'S HEAR IT
FOR EDDIE THE "F"!

13:43.456 --> 13:45.392
DUDE, YOU STOLE MY BIT.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.127
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.261
THE HOT DOG THING
IS MY BIT.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.597
YOU DO A THING
ABOUT SAUSAGES.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.966
SAUSAGES, HOT DOGS.
IT'S THE SAME THING.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.334
I LO THIS CHARACTER!

13:54.367 --> 13:56.069
THE WHOLE PARANOID
COMIC THING--

13:56.103 --> 13:57.537
OOH, YOU'RE STEALING
MY BITS!

13:57.570 --> 14:01.241
EDDIE THE "F"!
EDDIE THE "F"!

14:05.112 --> 14:06.146
I'M REALLY SERIOUS.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.016
THAT GUY STOLE MY BIT,
AND I GOT NOTHING
TO DO NOW.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.583
UH...

14:10.617 --> 14:13.954
FUTONS...

14:13.987 --> 14:16.323
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT GUY STOLE OUR JOKE!

14:16.356 --> 14:18.058
WE HAVE TO GET BACK
AT HIM!

14:18.091 --> 14:20.627
I ALREADY TOOK CARE
OF IT.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.333
AAH!

14:26.366 --> 14:28.168
AAH!

14:28.201 --> 14:30.303
AAH!

14:30.337 --> 14:34.207
WELL, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD STEAL ONE
OF HIS JOKES,

14:34.241 --> 14:37.344
BUT...YOUR THING
WORKED.

14:37.978 --> 14:42.682
SO DOES THIS STRAIGHT
LINE MEAN THAT SUPPLY
IS ELASTIC OR...

14:42.715 --> 14:46.419
HA HA HA HA!
STEVE, YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.389
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:49.422 --> 14:52.960
OH, HI, SEAN.
STEVE WAS JUST
DRILLING ME.

14:52.993 --> 14:53.994
WHAT?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.229
I WAS JUST
ASKING HER QUESTIONS
FOR THE ECON EXAM.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.430
HA. RIGHT. ECON.
GOOD SAVE.

14:57.464 --> 15:01.301
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SURE
DRESSED NICE.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.471
WELL, IT'S ECON.
I WANTED TO FEEL SEXY.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.539
WHERE WERE WE?

15:06.573 --> 15:08.708
UM, MONETARY POLICY.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.111
OH, MONETARY POLICY.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.546
HA HA! GOOD SAVE AGAIN!

15:16.749 --> 15:21.021
YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING
SICK AND TIRED OF
CLAUDIA'S STUDY BUDDY.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.089
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.524
YOU PAID
A HORNY COLLEGE KID
WHO LOOKS LIKE A MODEL

15:24.557 --> 15:27.194
TO HIT ON YOUR WIFE,
AND IT SOMEHOW
BACKFIRED?

15:27.227 --> 15:31.431
TO HIT ON HER--JUST TO
STAY STUFF LIKE, "I LIKE
YOUR EYES, MRS. FINNERTY,"

15:31.464 --> 15:33.366
OR, "YOU GOT NICE HAIR,"
YOU KNOW?

15:33.400 --> 15:37.537
THIS KID IS FEELING
HER SUPPLY CURVES
ALL UP AND DOWN ON MY COUCH

15:37.570 --> 15:38.705
IN MY HOUSE!

15:38.738 --> 15:41.341
YOU STILL KNOW THAT GUY
THAT BREAKS INTO PEOPLE'S
HOUSES

15:41.374 --> 15:43.410
AND PUTS FOOD
IN THEIR BEDS?
NO, I DON'T.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.345
DAMN! OK. I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THIS KID.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.214
HEY, SEAN,
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.216
BEFORE YOU DO
ANYTHING STUPID,

15:49.249 --> 15:51.051
SHE KNOWS YOU PAID HIM.

15:51.084 --> 15:51.951
WHAT?

15:51.985 --> 15:53.987
YEAH, SO NOW SHE'S
GONNA GET HIM A BICYCLE

15:54.021 --> 15:58.291
SO HE'LL HIT ON HER
SOME MORE AND MAKE YOU
JEALOUS.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.092
WHY WOULD--

15:59.126 --> 16:01.028
WHY WOULD SHE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

16:01.061 --> 16:03.130
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DID SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.465
NO, WHAT I DID WAS TO
MAKE HER FEEL MORE
ATTRACTIVE,

16:05.498 --> 16:09.202
TO BE A GOOD HUSBAND.
WHAT SHE'S DOING IS
SPITEFUL AND WRONG.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.271
SHE JUST WANTS TO RUB
MY FACE IN IT.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.341
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME,
PARTNER.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.175
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.345
WELL, I GUESS THREE.
HIM, HER, AND ME.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.346
HEY, SEAN.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.482
LET ME KNOW IF YOU
NEED A FOURTH.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.883
HEY, JIM,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

16:23.916 --> 16:27.287
ACTUALLY, CAN IT WAIT?
I'VE GOT A SCIENCENAUTS
MEETING. IT'S IMPORTANT.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.257
OH, NO,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.
I GOT YOU OUT OF IT.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.725
BRAD, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS,
BUT, UM...

16:32.759 --> 16:36.329
I DON'T THINK JIMMY
WANTS TO BE A NAUT.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.531
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.533
HE SAID IT WAS
REALLY BORING.

16:40.567 --> 16:45.038
THAT'S FUNNY,
BECAUSE I GOT THE IMPRESSION
HE WAS REALLY INTO IT.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.174
A LOT. ACTUALLY,
IT WAS KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.510
BRAD, I'M TELLING YOU,
HE WAS REALLY UPSET
ABOUT THAT MEETING.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.813
HE CAME HOME AND WENT
RIGHT UP TO HIS ROOM
AND LOCKED THE DOOR.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.417
HE DIDN'T EVEN
COME DOWN FOR DINNER.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.519
ALL RIGHT, I...

16:59.552 --> 17:01.188
GUESS HE'S OUT.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.623
TRUST ME. HE'LL BE
MUCH HAPPIER THIS WAY.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.193
WHY THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.661
I THOUGHT SCIENCE
WASN'T YOUR THING.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.763
NO, IT IS MY THING!
I LOVE SCIENCE!

17:10.797 --> 17:14.201
I LOVE WATCHING
SCIENCE!

17:15.368 --> 17:19.139
THERE ARE MANY FORCES
THAT INFLUENCE
THE SUPPLY CURVE--

17:19.172 --> 17:21.241
TELL ME AGAIN.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.176
OH, SEAN, I'M SORRY.
ARE WE BOTHERING YOU?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.445
'CAUSE WE COULD GO UP
AND STUDY IN THE BEDROOM.

17:25.478 --> 17:29.149
OH, NO, BABE.
I'M JUST GONNA READ
THE PAPER.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.852
UH, THE FORCES
THAT INFLUENCE
THE SUPPLY CODE--

17:32.885 --> 17:37.790
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
SEE THAT CHART
FROM WAY OVER HERE.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.493
THAT'S BETTER.
Sean: HA HA HA HA!

17:40.527 --> 17:41.594
IS IT JUST ME,

17:41.628 --> 17:44.331
OR DOES PEANUTS
JUST KEEP GETTING
BETTER, HUH?

17:44.364 --> 17:45.165
HA.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.101
STEVE, IS THAT COLOGNE
YOU'RE WEARING?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.202
NO. NO.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.105
WOW. I THINK YOU JUST
NATURALLY SMELL LIKE
THE OCEAN.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.673
OH, WOW,
I LOVE THE OCEAN!

17:53.706 --> 17:55.542
LET ME SMELL!

17:55.575 --> 17:56.743
UM, THE SUPPLY CURVE--

17:56.776 --> 17:58.745
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE RIGHT, BABY.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.281
IT'S LIKE BEING
IN THE BAHAMAS.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.116
STEVE, WHAT IS THIS
SHIRT MADE OF?

18:03.150 --> 18:05.718
YEAH, WHAT
IS THIS, STEVE?
IS THIS COTTON?

18:05.752 --> 18:06.386
I'M NOT SURE!

18:06.419 --> 18:07.887
WHY DON'T I
CHECK THE LABEL?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.322
NO, IT'S INSIDE
THE SHIRT.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.124
HEY, MY WIFE WANTS
TO KNOW, STEVE.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
DO IT, SEAN?

18:13.193 --> 18:13.726
NO, NO--

18:13.760 --> 18:14.927
I THINK I SHOULD
DO IT.

18:14.961 --> 18:18.498
NO, NO, NO, MY WIFE
WANTS TO KNOW WHAT
THE SHIRT'S MADE OF,

18:18.531 --> 18:19.499
STEVIE!

18:19.532 --> 18:20.733
I DON'T NEED A BIKE
THIS BADLY.

18:20.767 --> 18:24.637
I'M SORRY, STEVE,
THAT I HAVE A HUSBAND
WHO IS SUCH AN ASS!

18:24.671 --> 18:26.072
HEY, I'M SORRY, STEVE,
THAT MY WIFE

18:26.105 --> 18:28.675
DOESN'T APPRECIATE WHEN
HER HUSBAND TRIES TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR HER!

18:28.708 --> 18:32.379
NICE? PAYING GUYS
TO HIT ON YOU
IS NICE!

18:32.412 --> 18:35.782
BABY, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD!

18:35.815 --> 18:37.784
AND I DO!
LET ME ASK YOU,

18:37.817 --> 18:40.620
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY
THE PAPER BOY

18:40.653 --> 18:42.822
TO TELL ME I HAD
A NICE RACK, HUH?!

18:42.855 --> 18:44.491
I DIDN'T PAY
THE PAPERBOY ANYTHING.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.458
TOMORROW I'M TALKING
TO HIS MOTHER.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.461
OK, BABY, I'LL APOLOGIZE
FOR EMBARRASSING YOU,

18:48.495 --> 18:52.565
BUT I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE
FOR TRYING TO MAKE YOU
FEEL PRETTY AND SEXY.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.568
YOU KNOW,
HERE'S AN IDEA THAT WON'T
COST YOU 50 BUCKS--

18:55.602 --> 18:58.705
HOW ABOUT IF YOU
JUST TELL ME THAT YOU
THINK I'M BEAUTIFUL?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.641
I DO IT ALL THE TI--
WHAT DID I JUST SAY
LAST NIGHT?

19:01.674 --> 19:04.844
YOU SAID, "LET'S DO IT
IN THE SHOWER."

19:04.877 --> 19:05.978
THANK YOU!

19:06.012 --> 19:09.549
"LET'S DO IT IN THE SHOWER"
IS NOT "YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL."

19:09.582 --> 19:10.550
YOU NEVER TELL ME THAT.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.018
OH, MY GOD, I ALWAYS
TELL YOU YOU'RE
BEAUTIFUL!

19:12.051 --> 19:15.322
I TELL YOU YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
WHEN YOU LEAVE AND COME IN,
WHEN YOU WAKE UP--

19:15.355 --> 19:16.456
THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT

19:16.489 --> 19:18.225
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
SAY THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND!

19:18.258 --> 19:21.894
NO, I DON'T, BABY.
I SAID IT BECAUSE
I MEAN IT.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.265
I MEAN IT.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.600
REALLY?
YEAH! LOOK AT YOU!

19:27.634 --> 19:28.835
YOU'RE A KNOCKOUT!

19:28.868 --> 19:31.538
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
A KNOCKOUT WHEN YOU'RE
9 MONTHS PREGNANT

19:31.571 --> 19:33.940
AND YOU NEED HELP
GETTING OUT OF BED
AND--AND--AND--

19:33.973 --> 19:37.810
AND WHEN YOU PEE A LITTLE
EVERY TIME YOU LAUGH.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.549
THAT'S THE SWEETEST
THING.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.885
EVERYTHING EXCEPT
THE PEEING PART.

19:46.386 --> 19:50.923
ALL RIGHT. I PROMISE
I WILL TRY TO HEAR YOU
WHEN YOU SAY THOSE THINGS.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.461
OK. I PROMISE I WON'T
PAY GUYS TO HIT ON YOU
ANYMORE.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.663
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.766
HEY, BABY,
YOU WANNA GUESS

19:59.799 --> 20:02.569
WHAT FABRIC
MY UNDERWEAR
IS MADE OUT OF?

20:02.602 --> 20:04.871
YOU DON'T WEAR UNDERWEAR.

20:07.507 --> 20:11.678
DOG STAR, SOLAR WIND,
SOMEBODY LET ME IN, PLEASE.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.681
PLEASE, DOG STAR!
OH, BRAD. THANK GOD!

20:14.714 --> 20:17.984
LISTEN, I KNOW WHAT LILY
SAID ABOUT ME, AND IT'S
NOT TRUE, MAN.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.252
I DO WANNA BE A NAUT.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.354
SORRY, JIM.
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.690
NO, I'M NOT JIM.
I'M "M DWARF"!

20:23.723 --> 20:24.957
PLEASE, COMMANDER,
LET ME IN.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.560
JIM, COME ON,
WHERE IS YOUR
DIGNITY, BUDDY?

20:27.594 --> 20:30.730
I DON'T HAVE ANY!
I JUST REALLY WANT
TO WATCH THE MOVIE.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.600
NO. WE'RE NOT DOING
PHASE 2 TONIGHT.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.568
WE'RE DOING PHASE 3.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.669
WHAT'S PHASE 3?

20:36.703 --> 20:40.307
GENTLEMEN! AND NOW
DANCING NEAR THE
ERLENMEYER FLASK,

20:40.340 --> 20:44.377
GIVE IT UP FOR
THE LOVELY VENUS!

20:47.680 --> 20:49.516
OH, MY!

20:49.549 --> 20:53.386
SORRY, JIMBO.
TIME TO GET SCIENCE-NAUTY.
