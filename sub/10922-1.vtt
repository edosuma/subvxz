01:05.980 --> 01:09.131
In the great Gold Rush, Alaska
was the hope and dream of men,

01:09.740 --> 01:11.253
the ruthless siren
of the Far North,

01:11.460 --> 01:13.257
beckoning thousands
to her icy bosom.

01:13.460 --> 01:15.530
Beckoning thousands
to her unknown regions.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.618
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier
to the gold fields.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.254
Over this Pass men faced
untold misery and hardship.

01:21.460 --> 01:24.054
Many lost their lives.
Some fell by the wayside,

01:24.260 --> 01:25.898
others lost courage
and turned back.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.579
But the brave went on.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.253
Far into the icy north,
deep into the silent nowhere,

01:34.460 --> 01:37.054
came an undaunted lone prospector.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.814
And somewhere in that nowhere
was another lone prospector.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.049
With cheerful optimism
our little Columbus descended,

02:36.260 --> 02:39.093
then stopped, stepped,
slipped and slid.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.455
"Now let me see,"
thought the little fellow.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.571
"Before I know where I am,
I must get there."

03:39.300 --> 03:41.734
There in that frozen wilderness
a dream came true,

03:41.980 --> 03:44.335
and a lone voice shrieked
into the solemn sky,

03:44.540 --> 03:48.533
"Eureka! I've found it,
a mountain of gold!"

03:54.340 --> 03:57.650
But the elements laughed,
roared and thundered.

04:01.580 --> 04:03.377
In that raging nowhere
was a lone cabin,

04:04.100 --> 04:06.056
and another lone man,
Black Larson,

04:06.260 --> 04:08.455
an unmitigated,
predatory scoundrel.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.416
Out of the lashing storm
came the Little Fellow

04:48.620 --> 04:51.896
to find shelter and perhaps
a little hospitality.

05:03.180 --> 05:04.772
There he sat,
resting his weary bones

05:04.980 --> 05:07.813
as the icy wind howled
through the knothole.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.939
"Come here," said Larson.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.893
"What are you doing?"

05:43.340 --> 05:44.819
"Eating, obviously."

05:45.020 --> 05:46.055
"Get out."

05:55.580 --> 05:56.808
"Go on!"

05:58.860 --> 06:00.134
"Get out!"

06:08.660 --> 06:11.333
The wind also was giving
Big Jim his troubles.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.929
Big Jim was the noble type.
He had suffered.

06:59.140 --> 07:02.735
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.778
"Get out," said Black Larson.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.414
"Or I'll fill you both
full of lead."

07:37.620 --> 07:39.656
"Now then,
the pair of you, get out!"

07:40.980 --> 07:42.095
"Out!"

07:42.900 --> 07:45.812
That kind of noise
Jim don't tolerate.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.294
"I'll stay right here, understand?"

08:37.700 --> 08:39.929
"Right here," said Big Jim.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.856
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here,"
said the Little Fellow.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.254
"Understand? We stay right here."

08:59.820 --> 09:00.809
And stay they did,

09:01.020 --> 09:03.534
for days and nights.
The cabin moaned and groaned.

09:03.740 --> 09:07.130
Two men walked and never talked,
hunger gnawed their bones.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.498
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.

09:18.060 --> 09:19.937
"I must have food!"

09:57.540 --> 09:59.178
"What are you eating?"
Said Black Larson.

10:00.780 --> 10:01.769
"Nothing."

10:01.980 --> 10:03.095
"Open your mouth!"

10:14.100 --> 10:15.852
"Liar! It's that candle."

10:16.820 --> 10:19.698
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."

10:23.260 --> 10:26.696
"If I thought you were holding out
on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"

10:55.220 --> 10:59.008
"One of us must brave that storm,
if we're to get food."

11:01.100 --> 11:02.852
"Come here, the pair of you."

11:04.300 --> 11:07.098
"We'll cut the cards
and the low man goes."

11:23.300 --> 11:25.211
"You're the man," said Jim.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.573
"Goodbye, good luck."

11:33.780 --> 11:36.055
"Don't forget
to bring home the bacon."

12:00.100 --> 12:04.298
Somewhere in that nowhere,
the law was looking for Black Larson.

13:03.940 --> 13:07.455
Desperate with hunger
and here it was Thanksgiving Day.

13:07.660 --> 13:10.333
Nevertheless there was something
to be thankful for.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.649
"Not quite done yet,
give it two more minutes."

13:22.860 --> 13:24.418
"Come on, come on," said Big Jim.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.857
After scouring the country for food,

16:00.060 --> 16:02.335
the Little Fellow had to admit
he had seen nothing,

16:02.540 --> 16:04.371
not even a field mouse.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.012
From the pangs of hunger,

16:15.220 --> 16:17.495
Big Jim was becoming delirious,
hysterical.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.656
In fact he was a pain in the neck.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.334
"Food, food!" he thundered.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.058
"I can put another shoe in the pot."

16:26.260 --> 16:28.535
"No, no, anything but that!"

16:31.380 --> 16:33.735
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.

17:23.260 --> 17:24.897
"What's the matter?"
Said the Little Fellow.

17:25.099 --> 17:27.056
"I thought you were a chicken."

17:35.900 --> 17:38.255
"Well, build up the fire,"
said Big Jim.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.968
"What's the matter with you?"
Said the Little Fellow.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.456
"Come, my pretty bird,"
said Big Jim.

18:05.660 --> 18:07.059
"Don't be childish."

18:18.700 --> 18:20.850
"Hey, quit it.
Don't be foolish, it's me!"

18:23.260 --> 18:25.091
"You!" said Jim.

18:26.340 --> 18:27.932
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."

18:28.140 --> 18:30.608
"You're telling me,"
said the Little Fellow.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.331
"You go inside. I'll take the gun
in case you lose it."

19:05.820 --> 19:06.809
Chicken or no chicken,

19:07.020 --> 19:09.614
the Little Fellow looks appetizing
to Big Jim.

21:49.060 --> 21:52.848
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled
onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.771
Then came the parting of the ways,

22:07.980 --> 22:11.052
Big Jim to his mine,
our hero to his fate.

22:11.260 --> 22:12.534
"Goodbye," said the Little Fellow.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.856
"It's been a great pleasure
knowing you."

22:30.260 --> 22:33.411
Treachery awaited Big Jim
at his mountain of gold.

22:48.260 --> 22:49.978
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes

22:50.180 --> 22:51.898
of Black Larson

22:52.100 --> 22:54.056
and saw there the soul of a skunk.

23:15.340 --> 23:17.251
Caught in a maelstrom
of desperate deeds,

23:17.460 --> 23:20.179
Black Larson swept on
to impending doom.

23:41.580 --> 23:44.936
And out of a dream
in that frozen waste, a city grew.

23:45.140 --> 23:48.177
And humanity warmed it with living,
loving and desiring.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.849
Georgia.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.258
Jack was a ladies' man.

24:11.660 --> 24:12.888
Georgia was quick and impulsive,

24:13.100 --> 24:14.692
proud and independent.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.216
In the evening Georgia worked
as a dancehall girl.

24:53.540 --> 24:55.451
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.696
Perhaps that's why she resented him.

25:25.380 --> 25:27.018
Out of the night
came the Little Fellow,

25:27.220 --> 25:29.939
towards the dancehall,
that beacon light of pleasure,

25:30.180 --> 25:32.171
that retreat of lost dreams.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.931
"Georgia,
why aren't you nice to Jack?"

27:20.340 --> 27:22.615
"I believe he really likes you,"
said the girl.

27:23.420 --> 27:25.490
"He likes everybody,"
said Georgia quite audibly.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.975
"I'm bored with this place,"
she continued.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.695
"I'd give it all up if I could find
someone honest and worthwhile."

27:35.420 --> 27:37.934
"Don't worry,
I'll find him someday."

27:39.460 --> 27:40.893
Then she turned

27:41.100 --> 27:43.739
and looked and looked

27:44.060 --> 27:45.618
and looked.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.132
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?"
Thought Jack.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.534
"Get down off that high horse."

29:18.740 --> 29:20.378
"Me and you are gonna dance."

29:21.460 --> 29:23.212
"Hey there, pan out a tune."

29:27.660 --> 29:29.935
"Just a moment,
I said we're gonna dance."

29:30.140 --> 29:31.858
"I beg your pardon," said Georgia.

29:32.060 --> 29:33.493
To show her utter contempt for Jack,

29:33.700 --> 29:37.010
she picked out the most deplorable
looking tramp in the dancehall.

29:37.580 --> 29:39.013
"Hey you, come here."

29:42.020 --> 29:44.375
"Yes, you. Do you want to dance?"

29:48.300 --> 29:51.576
"You see, I'm very particular
about whom I dance with."

32:25.500 --> 32:28.731
And there he stood,
the dauntless cavalier, guarding...

32:28.940 --> 32:30.214
her sanctuary.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.656
"If you wanna make a hit
with your lady friend,"

33:10.860 --> 33:13.772
"you should put your hat
on straight, like this!"

33:15.220 --> 33:17.017
"Take that you... Ouch!"

33:27.700 --> 33:28.928
"Huh! Very good."

33:29.140 --> 33:31.415
"Didn't know me own strength,"
said the Little Fellow.

33:56.860 --> 33:59.932
Hank Curtis' cabin was
a stone's throw from the dancehall.

34:00.140 --> 34:02.529
Hank was a mining engineer
who lived alone

34:02.780 --> 34:04.008
and occasionally went
on long expeditions

34:04.220 --> 34:05.175
into the Far North.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.859
Hank was kind and human,

34:07.060 --> 34:08.697
and our hero cold and hungry,

34:08.900 --> 34:11.460
and the beans smelled good
and the coffee was steaming hot.

34:11.659 --> 34:14.969
So the Little Fellow
devised a way of getting breakfast.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.173
Big Jim recovered from the blow
he received from Black Larson

36:00.380 --> 36:01.813
but lost his memory.

36:19.940 --> 36:21.896
Hank's partner arrives.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.295
Both are ready to leave
on a long expedition.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.616
Hank informs his partner
that the Little Fellow

36:26.820 --> 36:28.970
is to look after the cabin
while he's away.

36:33.020 --> 36:35.898
"Goodbye," said Hank.
"And don't forget to feed the mule."

37:03.940 --> 37:07.410
Since that night in the dancehall
the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia,

37:07.620 --> 37:10.180
but an incident
was to bring them together again.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.414
There she stood,
her loveliness lighting the room,

38:04.620 --> 38:06.212
filling his soul
with the music of romance

38:06.420 --> 38:07.978
for which he was so ill-fitted.

38:08.180 --> 38:11.297
As she introduced her friends,
his heart began to sing.

38:25.260 --> 38:29.014
As they warmed up by the stove,
he excused himself to get firewood.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.609
And in that cabin
his secret was revealed,

39:07.820 --> 39:09.253
his love for Georgia.

39:09.460 --> 39:11.371
And the girls giggled and laughed,

39:11.580 --> 39:13.332
perhaps in order to hide their pity.

39:13.540 --> 39:15.849
For in the world of the dancehall
it wasn't wise for the girls

39:16.060 --> 39:17.413
to reveal their hearts.

39:17.620 --> 39:20.692
And so they thought
they'd have a little fun with him.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.291
There in the gloaming they sat,

39:28.500 --> 39:30.730
their faces alight with mischief,

39:31.100 --> 39:33.614
but all the while
his heart was singing.

39:56.900 --> 39:59.460
And so she fooled and flirted
and stroked his hair.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.890
He knew she was fooling,
but he was happy.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.489
For she was near him,
holding his hand,

40:04.700 --> 40:06.099
smiling at him.

40:15.940 --> 40:17.453
"Nice place you have here,"
said Georgia.

40:17.660 --> 40:19.696
"I hope you will invite us again."

40:19.900 --> 40:20.935
What if she were fooling?

40:21.140 --> 40:23.335
He was enjoying
the warmth of her attention.

40:23.540 --> 40:25.929
And the lady was enjoying
the warmth of his chair.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.335
And now she was leaving.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.417
The light of her loveliness
would be gone.

40:52.620 --> 40:54.372
And he would be left
with an emptiness,

40:54.580 --> 40:56.935
to return to his bleak,
lonely existence.

40:57.140 --> 40:58.255
"Pardon me,"
said the Little Fellow,

40:58.460 --> 41:01.293
"But, uh..."
He was lost for words.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.178
"Would you really like
to come again?"

41:05.380 --> 41:07.974
"Of course," said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"

41:08.260 --> 41:10.535
"We'll come for dinner
New Year's Eve," said the ladies.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.729
"Very well," said Georgia.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.090
"We'll come to dinner
New Year's Eve."

42:12.100 --> 42:15.172
Of course at that moment
Georgia would forget her gloves!

42:34.540 --> 42:37.008
For the next few days the Little
Fellow hustled and shoveled

42:37.220 --> 42:39.370
in order to buy
that New Year's dinner.

44:02.580 --> 44:06.368
The eve of a new year.
New hopes and new dreams.

46:17.820 --> 46:21.210
And there was Georgia, caressing him
with her smiles and tender glances.

46:21.420 --> 46:23.650
And the girls called for a speech.

46:23.940 --> 46:25.339
But he was too happy to speak.

46:25.540 --> 46:28.452
All that mattered
was Georgia was there. Georgia!

46:28.660 --> 46:30.969
So he muttered and stuttered
and finally said,

46:31.180 --> 46:33.250
"I can't make a speech
but I'll do a dance."

46:33.460 --> 46:35.769
And a dance he did, with the rolls.

48:43.380 --> 48:48.135
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

48:48.340 --> 48:52.856
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

48:54.220 --> 48:59.499
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

48:59.700 --> 49:05.252
<i>And days of auld lang syne</i>

49:05.700 --> 49:11.650
<i>For auld lang syne</i>
<i>My dear</i>

49:11.860 --> 49:14.613
<i>For auld lang...</i>

50:02.660 --> 50:04.776
In the midst of all their revelry
the vague memory

50:04.980 --> 50:07.130
of a promise crept
into Georgia's mind.

50:08.260 --> 50:10.535
"Let's go up and visit
the Little Fellow," she said.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.773
"We'll have some fun
with him," said Jack.

50:49.980 --> 50:52.494
"We'll send Georgia in first,
then give him a scare."

51:46.660 --> 51:47.649
"Oh, forget it," said Jack.

51:47.860 --> 51:50.090
"How about giving me
a little attention?"

52:11.340 --> 52:12.978
A day or so later
in the Recorder's office,

52:13.180 --> 52:15.091
Big Jim tried to convince
the assayers

52:15.300 --> 52:17.097
that he had a mountain of gold.

52:21.220 --> 52:22.892
"Where is this place?" they said.

52:23.180 --> 52:25.489
But Big Jim's memory
had failed him.

52:25.700 --> 52:28.168
All he knew was
that it was near the cabin.

52:35.780 --> 52:37.008
"The cabin, that's it!"

52:37.220 --> 52:40.849
"F I could find my way to the cabin
I could find the mine."

52:41.380 --> 52:42.972
"But I can't remember."

52:58.620 --> 53:01.054
"Hey!" said Jack,
"Georgia's been looking for you."

53:01.260 --> 53:02.295
The Little Fellow knew otherwise.

53:02.500 --> 53:05.173
How dare that cad mention
her name so lightly?

53:05.380 --> 53:07.211
For two pins
he'd give him another thrashing.

53:07.420 --> 53:11.095
However being a little underweight
he would ignore the insult.

53:24.060 --> 53:26.449
But it was true.
Georgia had been looking for him.

53:26.660 --> 53:27.775
Georgia had written him a letter.

53:48.020 --> 53:51.979
And as he went looking for Georgia,
so Big Jim went looking for him.

53:59.620 --> 54:02.293
"You, you!" said Big Jim.

54:05.380 --> 54:09.293
"You! The very man
I've been looking for!"

54:09.500 --> 54:11.570
"The cabin, the cabin! Where is it?"

54:11.780 --> 54:13.099
"Answer me, I say!"

54:13.300 --> 54:15.814
"Can't you speak, man? Tell me!"

54:16.340 --> 54:18.729
"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"

54:19.380 --> 54:21.530
"At last I shall find
my mountain of gold."

54:21.740 --> 54:23.298
"To your feet man, quick!"

54:23.500 --> 54:24.819
"You're coming with me!"

54:25.020 --> 54:28.535
"Take me to the cabin
and I'll make you a millionaire!"

54:31.660 --> 54:34.493
"Georgia! Just a moment,"
said the Little Fellow.

54:41.500 --> 54:43.934
"Georgia, you don't have to explain.
I understand."

54:44.140 --> 54:46.017
"I love you.
I'll take you away from this life."

54:46.220 --> 54:47.938
"I'm going away, and when I return,"

54:48.140 --> 54:49.493
"I shall come back."

55:00.980 --> 55:03.892
Exhausted and footweary,
they arrived at the cabin.

55:08.260 --> 55:10.137
"Ah!" said Big Jim,
"it won't be long now."

55:10.340 --> 55:13.776
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow
we'll start for the mine.

55:14.300 --> 55:17.212
"Here, take a swig of this.
It'll put hair on your topcoat."

55:52.380 --> 55:55.452
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop,"
said the Little fellow.

56:56.060 --> 56:58.494
Then fate - it's always fate -
played its little joke,

56:58.700 --> 57:01.373
and again the elements laughed,
roared and thundered,

57:01.580 --> 57:04.378
but through it all
our heroes soundly slumbered.

57:24.060 --> 57:25.857
Then came the dawn.

57:32.580 --> 57:33.774
The Little Fellow awoke,

57:33.980 --> 57:35.971
blissfully ignorant
of what happened the night before,

57:36.180 --> 57:39.456
but feeling definitely conscious
of "the morning after".

57:55.620 --> 57:58.578
"Oh well, may as well tidy up
and get breakfast."

58:22.340 --> 58:25.377
"This is the worst liver attack
I've ever had."

58:38.180 --> 58:39.499
"Feel that rocking?"

58:39.900 --> 58:41.015
"It's the stomach."

59:30.660 --> 59:32.013
"It's not the stomach."

59:45.500 --> 59:47.297
"Let's go to the other side."

59:47.500 --> 59:48.853
"We'll see how far it
will go over."

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.054
"Something
must be missing underneath."

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.296
"I'll go outside
and see what it is."

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.651
"Now," said Big Jim,
"don't get excited."

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.136
"Take it easy, don't move,
don't breathe!"

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.372
"I said don't breathe, stupid."

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.417
"You can be most annoying
at times."

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.449
"If you'll only be cool, be calm,"
said Big Jim,

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.298
"We have nothing to worry about."

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.694
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower?"

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.339
"Now listen,
I've got a very good idea."

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.457
"Hold your hands like this,
then I can get out first."

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.018
"You see what I mean?"
Said Big Jim.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.688
"Your mind is chaotic.
You have no psychology."

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.572
"You have no control."

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.049
And Big Jim discovered his claim!

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.131
"Now we shall be rich," said Jim.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.171
"We shall be millionaires!"

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.969
And so they were.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.379
Now they were homeward bound

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:04.855
and they were leaving the hardship
and toil of Alaska

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.579
to live in the land
of milk and honey.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.499
To live, laugh and indulge themselves
in the lap of luxury.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.260
They were famous,
and sought after by the press.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.295
In their cabin deluxe

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.570
they were welcomed
and waited upon.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.175
The reporter wanted to write
the Little Fellow's life story,

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.689
"From Rags to Riches",
and he graciously consented.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.259
And Big Jim was manicured.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.849
"Not the nails," said he,
"the corns."

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.093
The reporter thought of a good idea,

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.416
to have the Little Fellow pose
in his mining clothes.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.417
It would make a human story.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.455
Georgia...

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:36.769
There she was in the steerage.
Neither knew of the other's presence.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.017
Georgia overheard the officer say
there was a stowaway aboard.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.539
"You!" said Georgia.

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:11.890
"I thought I'd never see you again."

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.818
And then she mistook him
for the stowaway.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.372
The officer was going
to put him in irons.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.492
But Georgia pleaded for him
and said she would pay his fare.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.652
"Heck!" said the Captain.
"That's no stowaway."

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.420
"That's Big Jim's partner,
the multimillionaire."

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.570
Then of course there were apologies.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.651
The Little Fellow
gathered himself together.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:58.658
James, the valet, was told
to prepare for an extra guest.

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.778
"Pardon me," said the reporter,
"but who's the lady?"

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.853
"Buzz buzz buzz!"

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.290
"Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations."

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:18.337
"This will make a great story,
and with a happy ending."

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.089
And so it was.

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.738
A happy ending.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:32.411
