00:04.004 --> 00:05.309
Previously on The Game...

00:05.353 --> 00:07.268
I meant to give you this
last night,

00:07.311 --> 00:09.096
but we were having
too much fun.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.532
It's nice to meet you, Brittany.

00:10.575 --> 00:13.056
I'm Allison Morris,
Jamison's ex.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.276
Union said we don't have
enough owner votes

00:15.319 --> 00:17.713
-to secure lifetime health care.
-So, it's on us, then.

00:17.756 --> 00:20.759
But the owners are unified.
We need you, Lik.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.196
Malik's looking out for Malik.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.241
To the new owner
of the Rick Fox Agency.

00:24.285 --> 00:27.070
Yes, the Tasha Mack
Mega Agency.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.593
Tasha, you're not certified

00:28.637 --> 00:30.117
'cause you didn't graduate
from high school?

00:30.160 --> 00:32.902
Loan's due in 48 hours.
Cash transfers only.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.425
I have Paxton on the line,
he doesn't think

00:34.469 --> 00:36.340
-that 48 hours is enough.
-The hell it isn't.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.169
You tell him to get his ass
to Vegas now.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.084
And cancel everything
for the next two days.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.305
-[clapping]
-Hey!

00:44.348 --> 00:46.263
-[gasps]
-Sleep on your own time.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.658
Erika, coffee, now.

00:51.094 --> 00:55.229
Paxton, where the hell are we
on this ridiculous deadline?

00:55.272 --> 00:57.492
Judge Peters
set a 1:00 p.m. hearing.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.146
She's good and she hates banks.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.104
That said, it may only buy us
about a week or so.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.237
A week is five dawg years
to the Colonel, okay?

01:03.280 --> 01:05.587
It makes the difference between
me losing this agency

01:05.630 --> 01:07.719
and putting a bullet
in his mangy ass.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.982
Get me that extension,
and stop eating!

01:11.071 --> 01:12.898
All the agents are on alert.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.248
We're ready to contact clients
as soon as you give the word.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.771
Okay, good work, Candice,
all right.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.294
But right now,
we need to keep this quiet.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.340
Last thing we need
are the players panicking.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.037
Hey, right, got it.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.821
Tasha, I just want you to know
as your number two,

01:22.865 --> 01:24.606
if we go down,
we go down together.

01:24.649 --> 01:27.087
Thanks, girl.
But we ain't going down.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.089
-Okay.
-Ha-ha!

Uh, come in.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.974
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.802
Are you up?

01:46.845 --> 01:50.066
Uh, yeah.
I can't sleep.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.590
Did you get my texts?

01:52.634 --> 01:55.550
Yeah.
Thought you could use a friend.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.725
-Thank you.
-Mm.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.728
PORSCHA: Tasha, how you
holding up?

01:59.771 --> 02:01.164
Porscha!

02:01.208 --> 02:02.948
Girl, I don't know.
You tell me.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.820
I'll have the financial plan
ready in a few hours,

02:04.863 --> 02:06.387
-then we'll know.
-All right.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.737
Erika?
Oh, damn.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.479
You sure you should be
doing that?

02:11.522 --> 02:13.350
Hey, hey, hey.
You assist me,

02:13.394 --> 02:14.873
and so does this.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.400

02:19.443 --> 02:22.185
Yo, my phone has been
blowing up all day.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.752
Like, I just want
some peace and quiet,

02:23.795 --> 02:25.319
but people keep on coming out
the woodwork.

02:25.362 --> 02:29.366
Anyone special?

02:29.410 --> 02:31.803
A couple old friends,
high school coach.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.241
-A cousin I thought was dead.
-[chuckles]

02:34.284 --> 02:35.938
TASHA: Listen up, everybody.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.681
[whistling]

02:41.422 --> 02:44.033
-Right-- Erika?
-Got it.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.601
Whatever you need to do
for the next 41 hours

02:46.644 --> 02:48.559
to be at your best,
then do it.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.258
'Cause this is the fight
of my life, and I need y'all.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.087
Damn it, I need all y'all.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.222
Go, now!

02:59.266 --> 03:01.659
[all muttering]

03:01.703 --> 03:03.313
Okay, here.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.228
Since we have some time off,

03:05.272 --> 03:07.187
how 'bout we have
some us time?

03:07.230 --> 03:08.927
-Us time?
-Mm-hmm.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.060
We can ride the High Roller
at the Stratosphere,

03:11.103 --> 03:13.149
because nothing
clears my head better

03:13.193 --> 03:14.759
than a good old scream-fest

03:14.803 --> 03:17.240
and some hot chicken from Hank's
with the extra pickles.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.373
Oh my gosh, it's so good.

03:19.416 --> 03:23.768
Yeah.
Uh... yeah.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.474
I guess you're not a
scream-it-out kind of guy, huh?

03:34.692 --> 03:38.174
More of a time-to-myself
kind of guy.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.613
I get it.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.182
Besides, I seen a lawyer
outside of Tasha's office,

03:46.226 --> 03:47.879
so something definitely
went down.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.620
Maybe she could use
some hot chicken.

03:49.664 --> 03:52.101
-Maybe.
-[chuckles]

03:52.144 --> 03:54.190
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.019

03:59.239 --> 04:00.675

if you need anything.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.894

where are the donuts?

04:26.788 --> 04:28.398
You stress-ate them
ten minutes ago.

04:28.442 --> 04:31.532
Then go get some more.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.840
-Erika!
-Okay, that's not a problem,

04:35.884 --> 04:37.581
but what kind of donuts
do you want?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.279
Do you like gluten-free,
do you want, like, dairy-free?

04:39.322 --> 04:40.323
Ooh, they have like

04:40.367 --> 04:42.325
-fried kinds.
-Erika!

04:42.369 --> 04:44.545
Erika, what is going on here?

04:44.588 --> 04:46.373

All I know

04:46.416 --> 04:49.245
is I'm the keeper of time, and
5:00 p.m. Saturday is D-Day.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.988
Tasha, look, I don't know
what's going on,

04:53.031 --> 04:54.250
but it looks like
you could use my help.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.470
No, this here is ICO.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.950
-IC-who?
-ICO.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.561
Inner circle only.
Get gone.

05:00.604 --> 05:01.910
No.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.827
Last night, I promised
to regain your trust,

05:05.870 --> 05:07.307
so let me prove my loyalty.

05:07.350 --> 05:10.440
Loyalty?
Oh, so you pledging allegiance?

05:10.484 --> 05:13.356
Yes.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.140
Here.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.707
Place your right hand
over my bible

05:16.751 --> 05:18.622
and repeat after me.

05:18.666 --> 05:22.452
I pledge allegiance to
the Queen Boss Bitch of America.

Boss Bitch of America.

05:27.109 --> 05:29.067

which she runs.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.547
To the agency which she runs.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.506

05:41.210 --> 05:42.777
Erika will brief you.

05:45.736 --> 05:46.955
Hi.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.435
So, it's gonna be
all hands on deck

05:48.478 --> 05:49.653
to pay off the Colonel's loan

05:49.697 --> 05:51.046
so he doesn't get control
of TMA.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.874

Erika, put my certificate up.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.398
-TMA?
-Yeah.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.358
-How is that even possible?
-Shit.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.578
Anyways, I am in control of...

06:04.538 --> 06:06.583
Uh-huh, nothing, apparently.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.932
How are we looking?

06:07.976 --> 06:10.021
I found a loophole
in the original

06:10.065 --> 06:12.415
-Rick Fox Agency deal.
-Rick Fox?

06:12.459 --> 06:13.938
When you acquired the company,

06:13.982 --> 06:16.332
it came with a reversion clause,
a ten-year buyback.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.160
If Rick activates the option,

06:18.203 --> 06:19.596
he has a year
to buy the agency,

06:19.640 --> 06:21.946
which gives you a year
to pay the Colonel

06:21.990 --> 06:23.600
and make this go away.

06:23.644 --> 06:27.169
Wow.
Paxton, this is brilliant!

06:27.212 --> 06:29.867
There's only one problem.
I'm not calling Rick.

Hey, wait, wait, wait, Tasha.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.959
Rick is in San Diego

golf tournament together.

No!

06:38.310 --> 06:40.443
That man was in love
with all of this.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.445
Now, CNN is just gonna
crack his heart,

06:42.489 --> 06:44.229
and besides,
I made that man a promise

06:44.273 --> 06:47.232
that I would die before I let
anything happen to this company,

06:47.276 --> 06:48.756
and that's a promise
I'm gonna keep.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.323
Tasha, time's ticking.
This is our best option.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.673

09:33.442 --> 09:35.009
'cause it screams money.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.228
[laughing]

09:38.316 --> 09:41.015
I am not selling
the jet, Porscha!

09:41.058 --> 09:42.669
Bring it up again,
I'm-a sell your ass.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.235
Paxton, she want me
to sell the jet.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.324
-Never gonna happen.
-It'll cover a third of the loan

09:46.368 --> 09:47.978
and put us in striking distance.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.763
-It's just a jet, we can...
-For centuries,

09:49.806 --> 09:53.070
Black women had to get everyone
where they needed to go.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.072
First, it was
the Underground Railroad.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.379
Then, we had to walk
white folks' kids to school.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.468
Then, we refused to sit
on the back of the bus

09:59.511 --> 10:03.603
till change came, so we could
buy cars for our families.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.953
Hell, my mama drove her car
until the wheels fell off.

10:05.996 --> 10:10.044
And now, I'm flying
my own jet, paid for?

10:10.087 --> 10:11.611
You know what that means?

10:11.654 --> 10:13.047
That means if this Black woman
can get there,

10:13.090 --> 10:14.396
then so can you.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.617
It means that they
have to listen.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.531
It means I belong.

10:19.575 --> 10:22.883
So, it's not just a jet,
and I'm not selling it.

10:22.926 --> 10:26.016
So, that's a hard no
on the jet, copy you.

10:26.060 --> 10:29.367
Bad news.
Judge Peters recused herself.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.805
Conflict of interest.
Her son's a student at OSA.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.850
-So, expel his ass.
-I wish.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.678
The stay is with Judge Allen.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.114
He has a standing
racquetball game

10:37.158 --> 10:39.073
Fridays at noon.
I'm headed there now.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.510
Well, don't just talk about it.
Be about it, Paxton, all right?

10:41.553 --> 10:43.643
Go, keep me posted.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.082
It's the Colonel.
He wants to meet.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.957
How 'bout that?
Three weeks as the players rep,

10:54.001 --> 10:55.437
and I did what y'all
been trying to do

10:55.480 --> 10:56.786
for the past five years.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.570
Yeah, I'd kiss the ring,
but that dumb stunt

10:58.614 --> 11:00.137
you just pulled
set us back a decade.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.487
Chance, I was in a position
to act, so I did.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.359
Yes, but you acted
before the strike fund

11:04.402 --> 11:07.057
was fully in place.
We're not ready.

11:07.101 --> 11:11.061
But Malik was only looking out
for Malik, just like always.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.715
Hey, he was looking out
for all the players,

11:12.759 --> 11:13.977
past, present, and future.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.849
Yeah, exactly.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.677
So, what is the league gonna do?
They gonna play or not?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.026
I'll know tomorrow
when we vote.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.462
But you're officially suspended.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.898
-What?
-I will be taking your vote

11:21.942 --> 11:23.813
by proxy, and voting no
for you and me.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.990
Ho, ho, ho, ho, hold up.
Dawg, I don't understand this.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.950
We got the owners on the ropes.
Now is the time, Chance.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.909
You don't understand because
you already got your millions.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.606
You don't have a family
depending on you

11:34.650 --> 11:36.217
like 99% of the league.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.177
They can't afford a strike.
Not now.

11:40.221 --> 11:43.833
Well, took you
long enough to call.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.835
Sensible people
should be sensible.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.184
I agree.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.273
-Please, sit.
-No.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.275
That's where I made
the deal with the devil.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.929
-I'll pass.
-As I recall,

11:52.973 --> 11:56.063
you asked this devil to dance,
and it was heavenly,

11:56.106 --> 11:58.195
until your son
opened the gates of hell.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.762
I have half your money
in pocket,

11:59.806 --> 12:01.329
and when the judge
grants our extension,

12:01.372 --> 12:02.504
you'll get the rest.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.071
So, can we just end this tantrum

12:04.114 --> 12:05.812
and get back to doing
business the right way?

12:05.855 --> 12:08.902
Oh, no, I never let emotion
get in the way of a deal.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.817
That's why I asked you here.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.602
-Listening.
-Tasha...

12:13.645 --> 12:15.996
you were 16 when you had Malik,

12:16.039 --> 12:19.782
and you turned managing him
into an empire.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.218
This is your vision,

12:21.262 --> 12:22.785
which is why
you should run your company.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.092
Well, I'm glad we see
eye to eye.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.790
Thank you
for ending this nonsense.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.313
No, no, no.

12:29.357 --> 12:32.490
Our deal stands.
I'm taking over TMA.

12:32.534 --> 12:36.059
-I want you to be involved.
-Involved?

12:36.103 --> 12:39.323
Legally, I had to put the agency
into a blind trust.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.412
Sadly, owners can't
represent players.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.458
I want you to run
daily operations.

12:43.501 --> 12:47.897
You want me to work for you
at the company I built?

12:47.941 --> 12:51.596
You will take home
a very nice salary.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.772
-Company will keep its name...
-Look,

12:52.815 --> 12:54.164
let me tell you something,

12:54.208 --> 12:55.862
you patronizing
fake-ass Jerry Jones.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.167
Who's having a tantrum now?

12:57.211 --> 12:58.734
What, you think
this is a game?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.083
This is my life.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.781
You will take my company
over your dead body.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.304
Tasha, be reasonable.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.350
You signed a non-compete.
If you don't work for me,

13:06.394 --> 13:08.265
you won't work as an agent
for two years.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.050
That's if I lose,
Colonel Cracker.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.226
No, that's when you lose,
Ms. Mack.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.709
Now...

13:17.753 --> 13:22.627
swallow that beautiful pride
and run TMA.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.369
Or Candice will.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.851
-My Candice?
-I'm giving you the opportunity

13:28.895 --> 13:30.635
to save the status quo.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.813
To the world,
you will be the mogul you are.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.077
No one ever has to know.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.601
I'll know.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.909
You'll have your money tomorrow.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.264
Ooh!
Miss Walk of Shame.

13:50.307 --> 13:53.745
Just passing through to rinse
pits, tits, and naughty bits

13:53.789 --> 13:55.312
before round two?

13:55.356 --> 13:57.793
Hardly.
I was helping Tasha all night.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.534
Ugh, left turn.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.057
What happened with your
hot and heavy plans

14:01.101 --> 14:02.319
with Mr. JJ Jiggles?

14:02.363 --> 14:04.452
Oh my gosh,
it was just off.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.151
So?
Did he see Allison?

14:08.195 --> 14:10.893
-Didn't come up.
-[laughing]

14:10.937 --> 14:13.287
And you didn't bring it up.
Classic Brit.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.464
Afraid of intimacy,
or are you afraid

14:16.507 --> 14:18.379
that your man is still stuck
on little miss blondie?

14:18.422 --> 14:23.036
Actually, I'm scared
that he doesn't know

14:23.079 --> 14:24.646
he's stuck on blondie.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.389
So wait, you and Garret
have these, like,

14:28.432 --> 14:30.217
heavy heart-to-heart talks?

14:30.260 --> 14:32.959
Girl, if I hadn't opened up
to him about my fears,

14:33.002 --> 14:34.786
I wouldn't be meeting
Apollo Maze tomorrow.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.136
-You're meeting Apollo Maze?
-Yes,

14:36.179 --> 14:37.789
but don't change the subject!

14:37.833 --> 14:39.879
Look, the best way
to get close to someone

14:39.922 --> 14:42.882
is to go through the tough stuff
and come out on the other side.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.014
Babe, that's where
the real intimacy is.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.365
Brit, just call him.
Be honest.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.020
-[sighs]
-I gotta go.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.369
Okay.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.636
-Hi.
-Is Candice here?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.290
No, she left after you did.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.336
Close her files, shut down
her emails, she's fired.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.859
-Okay.
-Set up a video call

15:03.903 --> 15:05.208
with all of the other agents.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.167
Can y'all close the damn door?
Mama!

15:08.255 --> 15:10.387
And tell the team to strap on
their astronaut diapers,

15:10.431 --> 15:12.302
it's gonna be
another all-nighter.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.957
Paxton, please tell me you got
your ass kicked in racquetball.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.742
Sorry.
Even took one to the nuts.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.614
Allen wouldn't grant a stay.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.572
-Erika, get me some ice, please.
-Damn it.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.357
-Ma!
-Hey.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.359
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey, baby.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.665
So, I did the right thing
with the walk-out, right?

15:27.709 --> 15:31.060
Of course, baby.
What you did was so brave.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.454
-Mommy's so proud of you.
-Good.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.890
So, what are
your clients saying?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.718
Can you nudge 'em
in support of the strike?

15:36.761 --> 15:38.241
[chuckles]
Hey.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.939
You know I got your back, right?

15:39.982 --> 15:41.418
-[chuckles]
-You know, Malik,

15:41.462 --> 15:42.985
you got a lot on your plate,

15:43.029 --> 15:44.465
so why don't you just
focus on your health,

15:44.508 --> 15:45.988
and start by getting some rest.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.250
-Me?
-Like, right now.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.557
No, Mama, you're the one
who look tired.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.167
Mom, what's going on with you?

15:51.211 --> 15:52.777
You said you needed a room
for a meeting or two,

15:52.821 --> 15:55.084
and this is a hell of a lot more
than that, Mama Mack.

15:55.128 --> 15:58.522
[chuckles]
It's just pre-planning, baby.

15:58.566 --> 16:02.483
You know, I got the New York
and Miami offices opening.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.919
That's all.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.705
This is for the strike,
isn't it?

16:07.749 --> 16:09.707
Whoo!
[grunting]

16:09.751 --> 16:14.408
Mack right, ah, ah, ah,
better get that act right.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.933
Malik, we need to talk.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.116
Mama, why didn't you tell me?

16:27.160 --> 16:31.077
How do you tell your child
you're about to lose everything?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.643
This is all my fault, isn't it?

16:33.688 --> 16:34.776
No.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.735
It's on me.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.913
I got greedy, I...

16:41.957 --> 16:43.393
should have never
bought Oakmont.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.961
Ma, how can I help you?
What can I do?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.746
Lik, there is nothing
you can do.

16:48.790 --> 16:53.186
Baby, even you can't raise
that kind of cash in 26 hours.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.668
I can't lose.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.281
I can't lose, Malik.
I can't.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.152
-Come here, Mama, come here.
-I can't lose.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.811
[sighs]
It's all I know.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.597
I mean, without this,
who the hell am I?

17:16.992 --> 17:18.994
JAMISON:
Clear your head, Jimmy.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.344
Clear your head.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.998
Breathe.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.434
[exhaling]

17:24.478 --> 17:27.263
That's right, man,
just get lost.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.222
Brittany looked
so good last night.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.833
Oh, come on, clear your head, J!
Clear your head.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.487
Breathe in.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.445
[inhales deeply]

17:35.489 --> 17:36.620
Out.

17:36.664 --> 17:37.795
[belching]

17:37.839 --> 17:39.493
Mm.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.930
Whoo, all right,
just, let's try this again.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.453
ALLISON: Hey, Jamison.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.543
Yo, great.
[chuckles]

17:46.587 --> 17:48.110
Now, I'm hearing voices.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.720
It's great, it's great,
it's perfect.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.374
[chuckles]

17:56.553 --> 17:58.947
-Allison.
-I knew you'd be here.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.691
This is where you came after
every game you ever lost.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.912
I haven't been back
since that day.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.092
What are you doing here?

18:14.528 --> 18:16.095
Keeping a promise.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.794
I was at the game last night.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.839
I'm so proud of you.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.147
I haven't seen that
since the, uh...

18:25.191 --> 18:26.931
Since it was in
my dad's office.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.498
Yeah.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.676
You haven't slept.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.331
You're still fighting insomnia.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.811
[laughing]

18:36.854 --> 18:38.769
Yeah, well, that's an
understatement this time.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.119
I...

18:43.644 --> 18:45.776
Allison, why are you
really here?

18:45.820 --> 18:47.213
The truth?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.304
I miss my best friend.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.744
That's just a little bit
about me and my label.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.615
I knew all that.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.487
I mean, I'm not--
I'm not a stalker or anything.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.403
I just...
What I'm saying is,

19:03.446 --> 19:04.839
I've been following
your career for years.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.362
I'm flattered.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.669
I'm-- I'm just here
to learn about you.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.279
It looks like
you're living large.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.716
I mean, you rented
a whole entire club

19:12.760 --> 19:14.370
for this meeting.
[laughing]

19:14.414 --> 19:17.156
Garret did this.
I mean, he's great,

19:17.199 --> 19:18.592
but he's not gonna help me
win a Grammy.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.376
[laughing]

19:20.420 --> 19:21.899
I'm just Raquel's teammate.

19:21.943 --> 19:24.206
-Babe.
-Ooh.

19:24.250 --> 19:28.079
Oh! Here.
I'll leave you to it.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.211
-Okay.
-Thank you, babe.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.301
Tell me about your roots,
your family.

19:32.345 --> 19:37.350
My dad was an ass,
so me and my mom had it rough.

19:37.393 --> 19:40.135
Bounced from city to city
till I found my voice, and...

19:41.876 --> 19:43.312
It's a lot of inspiration
in pain.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.184
That's why I love your sound.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.750
It's raw and it's real.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.448
I'm so glad you said that,
'cause I have this--

19:48.491 --> 19:49.971
this song that I've been
writing, and I would love

19:50.014 --> 19:51.842
-to play it for you.
-It's not an audition.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.235
It's not?

19:55.585 --> 19:56.978
I'm sold.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.719
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.068
I'd love to guide your career.

20:02.157 --> 20:05.116

-No.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.162
Okay.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.947

What happens next?

20:09.991 --> 20:11.688
Well, after meeting
other managers--

20:11.732 --> 20:15.692
and you should-- if you think
that we're a good fit...

20:23.787 --> 20:25.485
That's my standard contract.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.574
Have your attorney
take a look at it.

20:27.617 --> 20:30.141
Once you sign,
we start recording, and...

20:34.276 --> 20:35.843
Small incentive.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.192

20:37.236 --> 20:38.802
Mm-hmm,
and get used to it.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.456
Even without me,
your beautiful voice

20:40.500 --> 20:42.719
will be heard,
and it is beautiful.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.335
-Babe.
-What'd he say?

20:49.378 --> 20:50.901
-He's gonna sign me!
-What'd he say, what'd he say?

20:50.945 --> 20:53.252
-He wants to sign me!
-Ah!

20:53.295 --> 20:55.210
I told you!
Oh, I knew it!

20:55.254 --> 20:56.777
I knew it, I knew it.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.518
I will walk back the protest

20:58.561 --> 21:00.084
and get the team
to play Monday nights.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.912
And Tasha gets to keep
her agency.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.436
And we all get
our flowers today.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.090
This must be hard for you,
Malik.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.745
You're a good son.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.312
Beau...
[chuckles]

21:10.356 --> 21:12.358
Would never do anything
like that for me.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.185
Colonel, do we have
a deal or not?

21:14.229 --> 21:15.578
Your team voted to walk out.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.189
And I will get them
to walk back in.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.495
I believe that.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.671
You've become
quite a leader.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.369
But the union votes today.

21:23.412 --> 21:26.197
What if they decide to join
this charade and strike?

21:26.241 --> 21:27.938
Trust me,
that is not gonna happen.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.289
I won't give lifetime
health care to retired players.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.771
I'll accept
your original offer...

21:36.164 --> 21:37.861
...if we close right now.

21:40.386 --> 21:44.172
Son, if you didn't make
bonehead decisions...

21:45.826 --> 21:47.784
...you would have made
a fine owner.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.932
-Come with me.
-Come with you where?

22:04.975 --> 22:06.586
Look, I don't have time
for this.

22:06.629 --> 22:07.935
Come on.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.763

out here?

I had no idea
Brittany called you.

22:24.691 --> 22:27.128
Well, I can imagine
how hard it is for you

22:27.171 --> 22:28.999
to see this fine glass of wine

22:29.043 --> 22:30.479
knowing that you'll never
take a sip again.

22:30.523 --> 22:31.959
Tasha, I'm good.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.569
In fact, since we last spoke,

22:33.613 --> 22:35.266
I bought three more
Mercedes dealerships,

22:35.310 --> 22:37.181
was named ambassador-at-large
for the Bahamas,

22:37.225 --> 22:39.662
and also voted Nassau's
most eligible bachelor.

22:39.706 --> 22:42.317
All right, Slick Rick!
I see you.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.884
Who knows,
maybe I'll find Miss Right,

22:43.927 --> 22:46.626
and make her Mrs. Rick Fox.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.932
Oh, that's sweet.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.456
Did you see me
in Mogul Magazine?

22:50.499 --> 22:52.240
Yeah, real moguls
don't read Mogul.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.634
Why not?
Real people read People.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.511
I don't need
a white horse, Rick.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.208

half white.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.212
Look, I'm just a friend
looking to help.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.736
Let me be clear.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.828
If this goes down,
Tasha Mack Agency

23:14.871 --> 23:17.265
remains the Tasha Mack Agency.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.962
You initiate
your reversion clause

23:19.006 --> 23:21.356
and that'll buy me time
to pay back the loan.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.619
I keep control of TMA,

23:23.663 --> 23:25.273

to the Bahamas

23:25.316 --> 23:27.318

for my trouble?

23:29.930 --> 23:32.280
I knew that was coming.

23:32.323 --> 23:33.542
How much you want?

23:35.544 --> 23:36.632
Just one.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.820
All right,
get the papers together.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.518
I'll be back to sign 'em.

on my mom while I was away.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.494
Oh, it's nothing.
You know I love Miss Lula.

24:14.191 --> 24:19.458
Um, by my count,
I wrote you 47 letters.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.330
-[chuckles]
-But not a single response.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.638
I mean, you didn't really expect
me to write back, did you?

I mean, I was hoping one,
at least once.

No, I understood.

24:31.948 --> 24:36.910

till I saw Hard Blocks.

Don't we deserve to know
if what we had was real?

24:48.835 --> 24:51.359
No, the only thing that was real
is what happened to us.

24:51.402 --> 24:52.839
What happened to me.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.539
All right, we can't just--
we can't just erase that.

-No, we don't need to.

be honest with ourselves.

right now

that you don't love me,

we made about...

a couple hours ago.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.352
And she found me at this spot

29:49.396 --> 29:51.267
that I used to go
to clear my head.

29:51.311 --> 29:54.357
And for years, I thought about
what it would be like

29:54.401 --> 29:56.098
to see her again,
and then I was afraid

29:56.142 --> 29:57.621
that it would mess me up.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.580
-You know?
-Yeah.

30:01.712 --> 30:05.455
But, once it happened,
all I could think about was you.

30:08.763 --> 30:11.331
-[mouthing]
-[whispering]: Yeah, you.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.335
I do seem to have
that effect on people.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.597
Mm.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.207
-Right.
-Especially strippers.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.644
Oh, true.
True.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.124
How are we on the time?

30:22.168 --> 30:24.735
15 minutes,
and once Rick signs the deal,

30:24.779 --> 30:27.129
I will deliver a copy
to the Colonel.

30:27.173 --> 30:30.263
Oh, hell no!
Mm-mm.

30:30.306 --> 30:34.571
I am delivering and serving
this tangy dish myself.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.531
Foxy!

30:37.574 --> 30:40.360
-Hey.
-Hey, I see you, Bahamas-Obamas.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.492
Hey.
We need to talk.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.107
Rick, tell me the Colonel
didn't get to you.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.718
He offered me five percent
of the Fury.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.763
Malik's five percent.
You sold us out?

30:52.807 --> 30:56.680
It was ownership, Tasha.
Black ownership.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.117
What would you do?

30:58.160 --> 31:01.207
Half white, all devil.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.599
Tasha, don't be like that.

31:02.643 --> 31:05.037
I'd watch my back
if I were you, Rick Fox.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.866
'Cause karma is a boss bitch.

31:14.785 --> 31:17.266
-[laughing]
-Oh, and I do this thing

31:17.310 --> 31:18.833
where I try to avoid
tough conversations.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.618
Oh, well, I shut down
when things get tough.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.055
BOTH: I'm working on it.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.233
[chuckles]
Guess we have a lot to learn

31:27.276 --> 31:29.148
about each other, huh?

31:29.191 --> 31:31.672
Not gonna lie, though,
the more I learn about you,

31:31.715 --> 31:33.326
the more I want to know.

31:33.369 --> 31:37.896
I think... I might be falling
for you, Miss Pitts.

31:40.463 --> 31:41.856
Um...

31:42.988 --> 31:44.772
Do you wanna eat, or...

31:44.815 --> 31:46.861
Mm, yeah, but not a chicken.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.996
♪

32:04.400 --> 32:06.925
Well, you did it, Malik.

32:06.968 --> 32:09.318
I say we call Tasha
and give her the good news.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.146
Oh-ho-ho, no.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.844
No, she is never
to know about this, okay?

32:13.888 --> 32:15.194
-All right.
-MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

32:15.237 --> 32:16.760
please be seated.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.414
There will be time
for questions afterwards.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.983
[sighs]
After a league-wide vote,

32:22.027 --> 32:24.072
the 1,400 members
of the player's union

32:24.116 --> 32:27.858
have decided to follow the lead
of the Las Vegas Fighting Fury.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.904
We will not be playing tomorrow.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.993
The league is officially
on strike.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.299
-Questions?
-REPORTER: Did Malik Wright

32:33.342 --> 32:34.953
-instigate this?
-Yes.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.563
Malik Wright
did start the ball rolling,

32:36.606 --> 32:39.044
but we are all
in congruence now,

32:39.087 --> 32:41.046
everyone in the union that
voted for this strike.

32:41.089 --> 32:42.482
-You, sir.
-REPORTER 2: Are you upset

32:42.525 --> 32:44.266
-with Malik Wright?
-No.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.268
There's no reason
to be upset with Malik Wright.

32:46.312 --> 32:48.488

-COLONEL: To all clients,

32:58.454 --> 33:01.892
agents, and employees,
effective immediately,

33:01.936 --> 33:05.722
Tasha Mack will be stepping down
from the Tasha Mack Agency.

33:05.766 --> 33:08.508
Thatcher Holdings
has acquired TMA.

33:08.551 --> 33:12.860
We'd like to thank Ms. Mack
for her many years of service

33:12.903 --> 33:14.905
and passionate dedication,

33:14.949 --> 33:18.561
and welcome her replacement,
Candice Ross.

33:18.605 --> 33:21.695
I want to personally
thank you and assure you all...

33:21.738 --> 33:23.218
-[phone chiming]
-...that operations

33:23.262 --> 33:25.438
will continue as before.
