37:42.594 --> 37:44.594
Doug?

37:44.721 --> 37:48.306
- The Nepalese Kora was a blade
that had a distinct inward curve

37:48.433 --> 37:50.016
with a spatulated flare
at the tip,

37:50.143 --> 37:52.477
making it a weapon
for slicing and chopping.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.479
I will cut
across these sandbags.

your blades are.

The blade really wants
to chop and slice.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.133
The recovery of the blade
makes it one

38:23.260 --> 38:25.677
that wants to continue
for combat.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.887
One problem I have here
is this handle.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.306
It tends to roll.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.975

it will cut.
