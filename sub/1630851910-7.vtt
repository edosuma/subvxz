00:06.040 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:45.000 --> 00:46.280
Can I cover the body?

00:52.480 --> 00:54.000
You can go now.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.040
Let me see.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.160
-You need to see a doctor.
-I can't go to the doctor.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.560
You will have to do it.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.280
I can't, João.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.960
I'll tell you what to do.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.080
Bring some water, alcohol, and bandages.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
I can't.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.240
Listen to me.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.280
You're all I've got.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.920
Bring some thread and a needle too.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.480
Go on.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.160
I'll be back.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.560
-What happened?
-They are checking if there is a gas leak.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.800
Or an information leak.
They even checked my mattress.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.840
-Come on.
-They turned my room upside down.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.520
-They're still at it?
-They paid you a visit too?

03:38.600 --> 03:41.800
Bright and early. They kicked me out.
I barely had time to change.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.640
But my conscience is clear.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.880
As if that helps.
Now it's the same every week.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.720
Were you working
at the last 4th of July party?

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
Yes.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.800
Me and everyone else from the cafeteria.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.560
Why?

04:29.840 --> 04:31.360
Do you remember seeing Mia there?

04:32.960 --> 04:34.440
Yes, she was there.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.360
Did she seem cozy with anyone?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.320
James, Ramiro?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.400
No, they weren't there.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.800
But I saw her arguing with Dr. Miguel.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.360
Do you know why?

04:50.440 --> 04:52.640
No, they were talking in the back.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.160
I saw them
when I was taking bottles to the trash.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.720
But they stopped talking when they saw me.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.640
Can you answer me now?

05:02.680 --> 05:04.120
Who wants to kill you?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.200
The Americans.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.760
But they don't know they want to kill me.
They're just looking for someone.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.720
You have to run away.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.400
I have to stay and do my job.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.400
What are you involved in?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.760
Enough questions.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.280
There.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.040
You have to keep the wound protected.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.960
I have to go back to RARET.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.360
I'll help you clean the car.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.800
-Sir.
-Good morning.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.440
You know the drill.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.480
Can you open the trunk for me?

07:12.680 --> 07:13.920
What's wrong?

07:15.640 --> 07:16.680
You look terrible.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.920
I had a rough night.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.160
Those rough nights of yours
are becoming the talk of the town.

17:06.920 --> 17:07.760
Come in.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
I just came to see
if you're feeling better.

17:14.840 --> 17:15.880
Come on.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.520
It's infected.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.840
You should go see a doctor.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.000
I have you.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.560
They might interrogate everyone.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.800
I haven't seen anything.
I don't know anything.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.800
It would have been better
if you hadn't found me.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.600
Thank you, Ramiro!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.720
Fuck you.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.400
Why do you want to find out
what happened to Mia?

19:59.080 --> 20:01.000
Were you two involved?

20:02.800 --> 20:03.800
No.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.080
I don't believe you.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.520
-Come here.
-I can't.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.040
I have to go to work.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.640
They asked me for help
to bring Fernando's body from Guinea.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.440
I'm doing what I can.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.640
Thank you.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.240
Judging by the shape of the belly,
it should be a boy, huh?

21:20.400 --> 21:24.680
If boys make the belly pointier
and girls make it rounder.

21:24.760 --> 21:28.520
No one has been able to prove it yet,
but it is what they say, yes.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.320
Sofia, can you lie down
on the examination table, please?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.520
Let's have a listen.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.320
You just need to pull your shirt up a bit.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.960
That's it.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.480
It might be cold, okay?

21:50.800 --> 21:51.680
Just a little bit.

21:58.720 --> 21:59.600
Ramiro.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.160
It's beating so fast.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.680
That's totally normal.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.360
A baby's heartbeat
is much faster than ours.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.080
I'm gonna get me one of these.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.360
-Can I get up?
-Sure.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.800
I hope you'll be
just as excited if it's a girl.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.040
Girls are nothing but problems.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.680
And boys aren't?

22:37.200 --> 22:38.480
It's different.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.800
-Have you been feeling any nausea?
-Not yet.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.520
I'll prescribe some pills,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.920
but you should only take them
if needed, okay?

22:54.400 --> 22:57.720
What about the gas leak?
Have they solved the problem?

22:57.800 --> 23:01.800
I don't get involved in those things.
It's always difficult to find gas leaks.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.720
But I hope they'll find it soon
so we can rest.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.320
I hope so too.
Right. I'll see you in a month, yes?

23:07.920 --> 23:08.840
Thank you, Doctor.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.160
-Bye, Doctor.
-Bye.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.720
Don't worry. Thank you.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.040
He's with a patient.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.600
The prescription from the doctor.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.840
-Captain.
-Yes?

27:05.680 --> 27:08.640
Fernando Marcelino. Missing in action.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.360
What happened?

27:12.120 --> 27:13.200
Well, Fernando?

27:14.120 --> 27:15.720
Won't you tell us what happened?

27:28.360 --> 27:29.240
Here you go.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.480
Captain, may I?

27:33.280 --> 27:35.480
-Yes?
-Fernando's from back home.

27:35.560 --> 27:38.040
We were in the same platoon
when we were attacked.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.320
Come in. Maybe he'll talk
if you're here with us.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.520
During the attack,

27:45.680 --> 27:47.000
everything got muddled up.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.480
We didn't mean to leave anyone behind.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.360
I shot the darkies until my gun jammed.

28:07.240 --> 28:11.160
I was lost for days on end,
so I kept walking alongside the river.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.360
I knew I would reach the camp
if I walked south.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.760
-But I found a guerrilla group and we--
-How many?

28:25.880 --> 28:26.920
How many were there?

28:34.200 --> 28:35.080
Five.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.360
And they were heavily armed,
with Kalashnikovs and grenade launchers.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.160
I had the element of surprise,
so I attacked.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.520
I took down three with one round,
but then my gun jammed, and…

28:47.040 --> 28:50.160
I grabbed one of the dead guys'
Kalashnikovs to finish them off.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.560
One came near me. We started fighting
on the ground and then…

28:55.520 --> 28:57.280
then I got on top and I…

28:58.560 --> 29:01.560
I held the gun to his neck
till he lay still.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.080
I left the river
and continued along the dirt road.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.400
That's where I found the Commandos.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.000
We have to inform Lisbon.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.880
Your family needs to know you're alive.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.640
This son of a bitch is something else.
Who would've guessed?

29:19.320 --> 29:21.840
We need more tales of bravery like yours.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.000
This war is far from won.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.360
Will I be granted leave?

29:30.440 --> 29:31.800
I'll take care of that.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.960
You can go to Bissau for a few days.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.600
Can I go and keep him company?

29:35.680 --> 29:38.520
-So he doesn't get lost again.
-No way, beat it.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.280
Go on, go take a shower and rest.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.600
-If you'll excuse me, Captain.
-Go ahead.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.200
Take the bottle. Go on now.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.880
Maybe we'll get an American female doctor.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.600
-Dream on.
-You never know.

30:09.120 --> 30:13.480
My mother always said
that if we prayed really hard,

30:13.560 --> 30:15.320
our wishes would come true.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.760
You took us all by surprise.

30:18.640 --> 30:22.920
It was a surprise for me too.
But I just couldn't turn it down.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.600
Why did they consider you
for hospital chief of staff?

30:26.120 --> 30:28.200
Do you know anyone at São José Hospital?

30:28.280 --> 30:29.760
He doesn't think I deserve it.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.200
Not at all.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.480
Some bastards get lucky.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.640
I feel sorry for the patients, though.
All they'll get is aspirin from now on.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.680
Don't be envious.
It's bad for your health.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.680
-I'll call you when I go to Lisbon, okay?
-Deal.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.280
I hope it goes well.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.520
What do you think happened?

31:19.400 --> 31:20.640
The CIA is protecting him?

31:21.160 --> 31:23.480
Probably. And our government too.

31:24.440 --> 31:27.240
You only get a position like that
if you know the right people.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.240
James is having a pool party,
and everyone is invited.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.760
I don't think you should go.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.960
I don't have a choice.

31:43.480 --> 31:48.680
I think the pool party is just an excuse
to find out who got shot.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.920
If they find out it was you,
the entire operation will be compromised.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.000
What's that woman doing over there?

32:23.720 --> 32:26.440
-She's going to kill herself.
-Don't get involved.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.720
I know her.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.800
She has her child in her arms.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.480
And what will you tell
the police you were doing here?

32:33.080 --> 32:34.760
I can say I came alone for a walk.

32:34.840 --> 32:36.360
There is not much to do here.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.440
Close the door.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.640
I don't want you to be interrogated.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.560
We should all have the right
to choose how we want it to end.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.920
I understand you getting involved
with these people, João,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.240
but we're at war.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.920
We have a greater purpose,
and nothing can jeopardize that.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.920
Now we'd better leave.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.320
Come in.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.320
No pork sandwiches?

35:11.400 --> 35:14.640
Don't be such a yokel.
This is an American-style barbecue.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.400
I don't get why they mince the meat.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.880
That's for old people
who don't have any teeth left.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.520
Shut up. They might hear you.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.440
-Isn't João coming?
-I think so.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.320
I'll get you a glass of water.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.560
It's very hot.
You have to drink something.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.120
Hello, Carolina.

37:34.800 --> 37:35.840
Hello, sir.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.800
How are you?

37:37.320 --> 37:38.760
Moving on with my life.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.080
It's a shame
what happened to your husband.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.840
But you're young.
You'll find someone to take care of you.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.400
I know how to take care of myself.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.600
I have a job.
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.440
But if you ever need anything…

37:54.360 --> 37:56.160
You can count on my husband.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.640
Mrs. Sofia… Excuse me.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.560
Sofia.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.000
I'm going to lie down for a bit.
I've asked Anne.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.560
I'm bringing what you asked for.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.640
No need. Everybody is at the pool now.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.680
It hurts my face to smile all the time.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.240
It's not easy being a woman.

39:15.480 --> 39:19.400
We always have to live up

39:19.920 --> 39:23.400
to what's expected of us, don't we?

39:23.480 --> 39:24.360
Yes.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.440
What will you do now, Carolina?

39:41.280 --> 39:44.600
-What are your plans?
-Plans?

39:46.080 --> 39:48.240
Everybody makes plans.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.640
I wasn't brought up to do that.

39:55.400 --> 39:59.040
You've been handling things quite well,
given that you're a widow.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.840
We have to accept
the things we cannot change.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.560
You can trust me.

40:17.000 --> 40:17.960
Who is he?

40:18.680 --> 40:19.560
Excuse me?

40:20.960 --> 40:24.120
One of the engineers, perhaps?

40:26.880 --> 40:29.040
-Is he married?
-No.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.160
Is it João Vidal?

40:43.840 --> 40:46.280
Your secret is safe with me.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.480
No!

42:15.560 --> 42:17.200
Give me another ball.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.400
-This one?
-This one. With the head.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.600
Go!

42:20.680 --> 42:24.200
-João, come on in. The water is great!
-Coming, just having a cigarette first.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.640
-Wait.
-With the head!

42:26.720 --> 42:29.000
Bernardino, you have to get in too.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.480
Bernardino, do you have a cigarette?

42:39.520 --> 42:40.600
Thank you.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.360
Carolina!

42:56.920 --> 42:58.920
Can you pour me some of that sangria?

43:00.320 --> 43:02.280
And stay outside.
Don't go inside the house.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.400
Why?

43:03.920 --> 43:05.280
Just do as I asked.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.120
Something is burning.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.200
Fire!
