00:16.488 --> 00:18.178
<i>Dooku held for ransom</i>

00:18.926 --> 00:21.509
<i>After escaping capture by Jedi knights
Anakin Skywalker</i>

00:21.677 --> 00:23.433
<i>and Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

00:23.558 --> 00:26.508
<i>the villainous count Dooku
fell into the clutches of pirates</i>

00:26.941 --> 00:28.862
<i>Led by the brigand Hondo Ohnaka</i>

00:29.239 --> 00:30.797
<i>Eager to get custody of Dooku</i>

00:30.832 --> 00:33.028
The Republic agreed
to pay Hondo a hefty sum

00:33.063 --> 00:35.501
<i>in exchange for the Sith Lord</i>

00:35.673 --> 00:37.508
<i>But Anakin and Obi-Wan
had not counted</i>

00:37.676 --> 00:40.756
<i>on the treacherous cunning
of Ohnaka and his band</i>

00:47.473 --> 00:48.472
Master

00:49.406 --> 00:50.605
What happened?

00:51.219 --> 00:55.131
Well, I guess that pirate brew
is stronger than we thought

00:55.525 --> 00:56.756
I only took a sip

00:57.210 --> 00:59.006
We were drugged, obviously

00:59.521 --> 01:01.297
Why would they risk
losing the ransom?

01:01.833 --> 01:03.579
The deal appears to have changed

01:03.704 --> 01:05.762
They must be trying
to triple their payday

01:05.887 --> 01:09.255
A shrewd observation, Master Kenobi

01:09.662 --> 01:11.297
Great It's you

01:11.570 --> 01:14.817
I did warn you
these pirates were devious

01:15.126 --> 01:17.813
You will notice our shackles
are bound together

01:17.937 --> 01:20.144
I have tried to separate us

01:20.269 --> 01:22.213
to no avail

01:22.559 --> 01:24.869
It's bad enough
we have to be in the same cell

01:24.994 --> 01:28.129
but could you at least spare me
the sound of your constant chatter?

01:28.297 --> 01:30.676
And while I hold my tongue

01:30.801 --> 01:33.798
the two of you will devise
a brilliant strategy

01:33.922 --> 01:36.003
for getting off
this godforsaken planet?

01:36.421 --> 01:37.420
Yes

01:37.792 --> 01:38.791
Excellent

01:40.622 --> 01:42.929
I told you kidnapping the Sith Lord

01:43.054 --> 01:45.140
was a stroke of brilliance

01:45.470 --> 01:48.592
I can almost smell that spice now

01:48.717 --> 01:51.277
It'll be worth twice as much to us
on the black market

01:51.402 --> 01:55.298
But I think we could've gotten
a bigger ransom from the separatists

01:56.088 --> 01:57.087
You fool

01:57.500 --> 02:00.044
Sometimes I wonder
why I bother to keep you around

02:00.853 --> 02:04.835
If we tried to ransom count Dooku off
to the separatists

02:05.136 --> 02:08.155
they would simply send
their droid armies here

02:08.384 --> 02:09.806
to wipe us out

02:11.691 --> 02:14.575
Now as my sweet mother always said

02:15.253 --> 02:17.632
"Son if one hostage is good"

02:18.002 --> 02:19.352
"two are better "

02:19.686 --> 02:22.439
And three?
Well, that's just good business

02:23.407 --> 02:26.721
How much do you think they'll fetch?

02:26.846 --> 02:30.029
Don't you worry about how much
You'll get your cut

02:30.155 --> 02:32.838
Just see to it
that the Republic's ransom gets here

02:32.963 --> 02:35.041
Once we get the ransom for the Sith

02:35.166 --> 02:37.708
then we'll get the ransom
for the Jedi

02:37.833 --> 02:39.082
Thank you, mom

02:43.451 --> 02:44.890
The spice is on its way

02:45.014 --> 02:47.512
Hondo has asked me to go out
and meet the Republic senators

02:47.637 --> 02:49.509
and bring them here with the ransom

02:49.634 --> 02:52.930
But I want you to intercept that ship
and force it down

02:53.068 --> 02:54.584
Be careful

02:55.129 --> 02:57.044
I want that spice intact

02:58.832 --> 03:01.192
It's too risky
What about Hondo?

03:01.808 --> 03:05.734
Yeah, that nitwit couldn't kill a nuna
He depends on me for that

03:05.859 --> 03:08.330
I'll tell him the ship was destroyed
with everyone on it

03:08.454 --> 03:09.855
including the spice

03:09.980 --> 03:13.248
By the time he finds out the truth
we'll be long gone

03:17.524 --> 03:20.227
<i>- And we'll be landing
- Hidey ho, chancellor</i>

03:20.352 --> 03:23.829
<i>- Me-sa have a question
- In a moment, representative Binks</i>

03:24.783 --> 03:27.032
Good work, Senator Kharrus

03:27.156 --> 03:30.871
I am relieved you're about to arrive
at the pirates' stronghold safely

03:31.278 --> 03:34.525
Captain Hondo
the leader of those brigands

03:34.649 --> 03:36.277
will accept the ransom

03:36.537 --> 03:39.082
and turn count Dooku
over to the Jedi

03:39.207 --> 03:41.370
And then
they will bring him back with you

03:41.640 --> 03:45.077
Once we've landed,
our signal will be strong enough

03:45.202 --> 03:47.636
to set up proper communications

03:47.760 --> 03:49.209
<i>Thank you, Senator</i>

03:53.876 --> 03:56.502
Senator Kharrus representative Binks
take your seats

03:56.627 --> 03:58.675
We are coming in for a landing

03:59.120 --> 04:02.267
The last time I went
on one of these ransom missions

04:02.760 --> 04:04.951
I spent three weeks in a dungeon

04:06.116 --> 04:08.410
Representative Binks
stop fooling around

04:08.535 --> 04:10.846
We're landing
Secure yourself

04:11.151 --> 04:12.409
Me-sa trying

04:12.858 --> 04:14.368
Is-sa stucken

04:26.719 --> 04:29.325
- We're under attack
- We've been betrayed

04:41.055 --> 04:42.657
- Missile closing
- Bank left

04:48.526 --> 04:49.656
What the

04:50.442 --> 04:53.590
- Jar Jar, what are you doing?
- Sorry Me-sa fix it

04:54.187 --> 04:57.365
- Mack, what's going on back there?
- Sir, you must get out of the cockpit

04:59.548 --> 05:01.281
- We're hit
- Sir, you must leave

05:03.344 --> 05:05.014
Get back into your seat

05:12.406 --> 05:13.572
We're going down

05:35.456 --> 05:38.987
Don't you think our priority
should be escape first, eat second?

05:44.276 --> 05:48.153
Do control your protégé's insolence
so I can concentrate

05:51.435 --> 05:52.750
- Anakin
- What?

05:52.875 --> 05:56.319
Control your insolence
The count is concentrating

06:04.114 --> 06:06.735
Well done, if I do say so myself

06:07.298 --> 06:08.597
Most impressive

06:22.281 --> 06:24.233
Me-sa no see a senator Kharrus

06:25.748 --> 06:26.776
Pilots are dead

06:28.025 --> 06:30.150
Sir, over here
I found the senator

06:35.891 --> 06:37.108
He can't be dead

06:37.638 --> 06:40.685
We've got to figure out
a way to contact Coruscant

06:43.571 --> 06:45.399
They crashed into Doshar field

06:45.954 --> 06:49.349
Good, good
And you have the spice?

06:50.653 --> 06:52.497
No, not exactly No

06:52.622 --> 06:54.520
I think there are survivors

06:54.808 --> 06:58.094
We have to call it off
Maybe we should tell Hondo

06:58.725 --> 07:00.633
No one tells Hondo anything

07:01.104 --> 07:03.773
If anyone survived that crash
we'll take care of 'em

07:05.377 --> 07:06.360
Trust me

07:06.931 --> 07:08.920
we're getting that spice

07:17.784 --> 07:21.341
We do know where we're going
don't we?

07:21.466 --> 07:22.615
Hush, Anakin

07:22.740 --> 07:24.777
Do we know where we're going?

07:24.902 --> 07:25.901
Quiet

07:26.771 --> 07:30.647
I was brought this way
when I was captured, it was open then

07:31.481 --> 07:32.943
I found the door key

07:35.141 --> 07:37.139
This is the way to the hangar

07:37.264 --> 07:40.103
Yes, but are you sure it's safe?

07:40.272 --> 07:42.395
- The key works
- Is it safe?

07:42.945 --> 07:44.244
Of course it is

07:45.254 --> 07:46.253
Right

07:49.567 --> 07:51.645
Hold it right there, Jedi

08:01.050 --> 08:03.835
What were we thinking
following a Sith Lord?

08:04.265 --> 08:07.019
What to do?
What to do? What to do?

08:07.480 --> 08:10.515
I don't want to kill you, per se

08:11.165 --> 08:14.060
In fact
you seem like decent fellows

08:14.474 --> 08:17.268
Even you Count
This is just business

08:17.436 --> 08:21.119
and once I get my money
we can go back to being friends

08:22.092 --> 08:23.440
It's very simple

08:23.588 --> 08:27.267
Now, try not to complicate things
by breaking out again

08:31.518 --> 08:35.388
We have to get out of here before
the Republic arrives with the ransom

08:35.513 --> 08:37.669
For once, I agree with you

08:48.062 --> 08:51.152
- Any luck repairing the homing beacon?
- No, sir

08:55.368 --> 08:57.166
You-sa find rest, Senator

08:58.239 --> 09:00.308
Thosen with good in their heart

09:00.433 --> 09:02.349
always passen too soon

09:03.857 --> 09:07.857
Sir with the death of senator Kharrus
are you now in command of the mission?

09:08.165 --> 09:09.590
Technically, no

09:10.101 --> 09:11.904
Then, who is?

09:12.516 --> 09:15.638
Representative Binks
is the highest-ranking person here

09:15.806 --> 09:18.930
- We be missing you, Senator
- Sir, this place is dangerous

09:19.099 --> 09:21.696
Look, those geysers
are spitting out acid

09:23.753 --> 09:26.138
These-a beasties
don't like the geysers neither

09:29.070 --> 09:30.455
What is it, Sergeant?

09:30.579 --> 09:34.429
How are we gonna deliver the ransom
to the Jedi and get count Dooku back?

09:38.882 --> 09:41.296
You do not want to stand guard

09:41.818 --> 09:44.803
I do not want to stand guard

09:44.972 --> 09:47.616
You want to deactivate the cell bars

09:47.741 --> 09:50.219
and go out drinking

09:50.717 --> 09:53.579
I want to deactivate the cell bars

09:53.704 --> 09:55.053
and go out drinking

09:58.360 --> 09:59.361
Not bad

09:59.608 --> 10:03.053
Yes, most impressive, Master Kenobi

10:05.257 --> 10:06.617
What's-a that?

10:11.846 --> 10:13.344
You think this is trouble?

10:13.721 --> 10:16.341
They could be the ones we're
supposed to deliver the ransom to

10:16.465 --> 10:19.135
Or they-sa the ones
that be shooting us down

10:24.233 --> 10:27.384
You're right, Binks Incoming
Form a circle

10:36.522 --> 10:38.383
There's not enough cover out here

10:38.650 --> 10:41.197
They're cutting us off
from the shuttle

10:42.252 --> 10:43.843
We've got to regroup

10:47.960 --> 10:49.551
Follow me Let's hide

10:50.368 --> 10:51.509
Come on, men

11:00.998 --> 11:02.152
Where'd they go?

11:02.277 --> 11:04.632
I don't know
Maybe they fell in a crater

11:06.423 --> 11:07.650
Find the spice

11:07.775 --> 11:09.949
Should we look for the clones
in the crater?

11:10.074 --> 11:11.358
Get back here

11:11.483 --> 11:13.672
Once that geyser goes off
they're broiled

11:16.702 --> 11:19.284
- We're not gonna last long in here
- Don't worry

11:19.409 --> 11:22.048
As long as those beasties
are up there, we're safe

11:22.673 --> 11:24.421
When they run, we run

11:27.015 --> 11:30.505
See? Me-sa knew it was safe
since the beasties are nearby

11:52.066 --> 11:53.452
Come on, let's go

12:02.513 --> 12:04.961
Commander, you're right
The ransom's gone

12:06.729 --> 12:08.883
I suggest we stay here
and wait for the Republic

12:09.008 --> 12:11.335
- to send the rescue party
- We-sa can't wait

12:11.794 --> 12:13.585
We don't have much choice

12:14.027 --> 12:16.669
Ani and Obi are waiting for us
to deliver the spicen

12:17.081 --> 12:19.835
Those pirates are on speeders
How are we gonna catch them?

12:20.596 --> 12:22.257
Me-sa be having an idea

12:28.903 --> 12:30.445
Hurry it up, Dooku

12:36.455 --> 12:38.642
You should be more patient, Master

12:38.767 --> 12:41.434
After all, the count
is an elderly gentleman

12:41.559 --> 12:44.788
- and doesn't move like he used to
- I suppose you're right

12:45.198 --> 12:47.281
I would kill you both right now

12:47.406 --> 12:50.146
if I did not have
to drag your bodies

12:55.012 --> 12:56.457
Look There they are

12:57.089 --> 12:58.083
Giddy up

13:29.850 --> 13:32.517
Let him go, sir
We've got the spice back

13:39.682 --> 13:41.579
Now we just have
to get beyond that wall

13:42.084 --> 13:43.145
Let's go

13:59.937 --> 14:01.537
This is not going well

14:01.818 --> 14:03.516
Don't let them get away

14:09.742 --> 14:11.619
Hey, what are you guys doing?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.827
You're too heavy
I can't do it

14:17.144 --> 14:18.615
Drop Dooku

14:20.537 --> 14:23.382
I guess this means
we won't be friend?

14:26.516 --> 14:29.838
Right now that we have the spice
we need to find the compound

14:29.963 --> 14:32.086
- Anything to the south?
- Nothing, sir

14:32.211 --> 14:35.357
Who knows where
that pirate stronghold is from here

14:35.644 --> 14:37.195
Well, look at that

14:37.942 --> 14:39.016
Power lines

14:39.865 --> 14:41.513
They must lead somewhere

14:41.638 --> 14:44.228
There's-a power
dere's-a be people too

14:52.310 --> 14:53.181
Captain

14:53.504 --> 14:54.553
Well, Turk

14:54.788 --> 14:58.028
did the Republic arrive
with my spice?

14:58.316 --> 14:59.740
The Republic deceived us

15:00.118 --> 15:02.679
They didn't send the ransom
they sent an army

15:02.804 --> 15:04.552
They ambushed us in Doshar field

15:04.677 --> 15:06.782
I suggest we counterattack
with tanks

15:07.434 --> 15:10.439
- Where are your men?
- I was the only survivor

15:10.919 --> 15:13.281
I think they will attack us
to try and free the Jedi

15:15.335 --> 15:16.533
I warned them

15:17.154 --> 15:18.364
I didn't want

15:18.488 --> 15:19.914
to torture anyone

15:20.039 --> 15:22.741
But now even in a galaxy at war

15:23.669 --> 15:25.697
you hope to find some honor

15:26.092 --> 15:28.696
Let me take our tanks
I'll make 'em pay

15:29.487 --> 15:32.338
Go Stop them before they reach
the compound

15:32.960 --> 15:34.829
I will deal with the Jedi

15:35.459 --> 15:36.608
Yes, Captain

15:40.032 --> 15:41.760
We have to find a way out of here

15:41.884 --> 15:43.779
before Senator Kharrus
and Jar Jar arrive

15:44.108 --> 15:45.488
We'll look like fools

15:46.068 --> 15:48.630
I think it's time
to lose the dead weight

15:52.026 --> 15:53.487
You two, come with us

16:02.332 --> 16:05.421
There be some bombat clankens
coming this-a way

16:06.260 --> 16:08.238
What? Bombat clankens?

16:08.946 --> 16:09.973
Right there

16:10.098 --> 16:11.447
- Where?
- There

16:12.260 --> 16:14.666
- Wait
- Over there Come on There

16:16.271 --> 16:18.652
You're right Bombat clankers

16:22.798 --> 16:25.790
Representative Binks
we're going to need your services

16:25.914 --> 16:28.902
- for this part of the mission
- Who-sa? Me-sa?

16:29.027 --> 16:31.955
Yes, sir
You are the senate representative

16:32.309 --> 16:35.859
We need you to go out there
and negotiate with the pirates

16:37.838 --> 16:39.585
Me-sa no liken this idea

16:39.710 --> 16:42.775
but I think is-sa
what senator Kharrus woulda do-sa

16:44.092 --> 16:46.010
He's probably going
to get himself killed

16:46.135 --> 16:48.683
Don't worry
He's smarter than he looks

16:58.556 --> 17:01.441
I take it the Republic didn't arrive
with the ransom

17:04.740 --> 17:07.891
Your Republic obviously doesn't want

17:08.397 --> 17:09.607
the Sith Lord

17:10.013 --> 17:11.148
They didn't show?

17:12.476 --> 17:14.230
They did
They did show

17:14.355 --> 17:17.230
With a huge army
that they thought would be enough

17:17.355 --> 17:19.363
to get the better of me

17:19.813 --> 17:21.939
- Hondo
- That can't be right

17:22.324 --> 17:23.855
Are you calling me a liar?

17:24.558 --> 17:26.606
Isn't that kind of what you do
for a living?

17:27.342 --> 17:29.631
You reject my hospitality

17:30.068 --> 17:32.681
refuse to wait in your cell

17:33.273 --> 17:34.271
and now

17:34.396 --> 17:36.604
you're going to insult me?

17:36.994 --> 17:38.893
- I'm just saying
- Anakin

17:39.018 --> 17:40.730
What? He is a pirate

17:40.955 --> 17:44.771
Yes, but this may not be the best time
for you to speak

17:45.327 --> 17:47.062
- But you
- At all, Anakin

17:57.498 --> 17:59.645
What are you supposed to be?

18:00.727 --> 18:02.650
Me-sa representative Binks

18:02.930 --> 18:04.853
Me-sa coming to deliver the spicen

18:06.204 --> 18:08.379
Where's the army Turk reported?

18:08.769 --> 18:09.861
Don't know

18:10.048 --> 18:12.367
Let's fry this one and look around

18:12.859 --> 18:15.245
No if he's a representative

18:15.829 --> 18:18.229
he might be worth something as well

18:18.672 --> 18:20.620
You representative Bink

18:20.990 --> 18:22.767
we'll take you to your Jedi friends

18:23.145 --> 18:25.216
so you can negotiate

18:28.177 --> 18:29.185
Okey day

18:31.116 --> 18:32.518
Sir, they're taking

18:32.686 --> 18:35.229
- representative Binks hostage
- Get ready

18:41.798 --> 18:42.946
Sorry Sorry

18:54.340 --> 18:57.070
What happened to the power?
I was having fun

19:08.413 --> 19:09.527
What the

19:25.148 --> 19:26.472
Hold it right there

19:27.262 --> 19:28.718
Kill him Kill him

19:29.170 --> 19:31.639
He's no representative
He's a plague

19:32.442 --> 19:34.139
Who's-a plague-a? Me-sa?

19:35.619 --> 19:38.644
I wouldn't do that if I were you
Nice work, sir

19:44.908 --> 19:46.555
We're leaving without the spice?

19:47.275 --> 19:50.637
It won't be long until Hondo
figures out what's happened

19:57.816 --> 19:59.554
What are you doing?

20:08.398 --> 20:11.078
What chance
do you really have, Jedi?

20:11.888 --> 20:13.107
Now let me go

20:13.647 --> 20:15.511
and I might let you live

20:16.159 --> 20:18.011
Approach us, and he dies

20:21.228 --> 20:24.528
Looks like your forces
were destroyed, Jedi

20:25.786 --> 20:27.027
Ani Obi

20:29.237 --> 20:31.218
Me-sa have arrived with the spicen

20:31.715 --> 20:35.592
Excellent, Jar Jar, assuming he pirates
still have count Dooku to trade

20:43.265 --> 20:45.495
Well, that answers that question

20:50.560 --> 20:52.894
Commander
start the engines please

20:53.019 --> 20:54.757
So what now, Jedi?

20:55.835 --> 20:57.916
You're going to arrest me?

20:58.815 --> 21:01.392
- No Anakin, release him
- What?

21:01.995 --> 21:03.869
Captain
you have nothing we want

21:03.994 --> 21:07.123
and since we're not prisoners anymore
you have no bargaining power

21:07.248 --> 21:09.563
What?
You-sa was in bombad trouble?

21:10.142 --> 21:11.424
Me-sa rescued you

21:11.970 --> 21:14.507
No, Jar Jar
We weren't in any trouble

21:15.358 --> 21:17.174
Let's leave on even terms

21:20.037 --> 21:21.111
Hold
Hold

21:21.788 --> 21:22.592
Jedi

21:22.959 --> 21:24.298
after everything

21:24.908 --> 21:27.006
you're just going to walk away?

21:27.596 --> 21:30.506
We have no quarrel with you
and we seek no revenge

21:31.028 --> 21:32.027
Indeed

21:32.404 --> 21:33.739
Very honorable

21:34.048 --> 21:35.131
Master Jedi

21:35.837 --> 21:36.707
Captain

21:36.832 --> 21:40.394
you will find that count Dooku
doesn't share our sense of honor

21:40.519 --> 21:42.651
and he knows where you live

21:43.305 --> 21:49.516
