00:15.057 --> 00:19.019
Work harder! Keep on!

01:20.414 --> 01:21.707
Cut!

01:22.666 --> 01:26.378
Wake up! Even extras are actors.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.797
We're not making a ghost film now.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.675
Though you guys
play the roles of pedestrians,

01:31.842 --> 01:34.720
but your roles still have life an soul.

01:34.845 --> 01:39.683
Especially we've chance to act with
the Kungfu actress Queen Cuckoo Tu...

01:39.808 --> 01:41.768
so we should grasp this chance.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.770
Act smartly, OK?

01:46.690 --> 01:47.774
Action!

01:51.987 --> 01:53.197
Cut!

01:54.948 --> 01:57.201
- Who are you?
- I'm an actor.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.660
Aunt Ha!

01:58.952 --> 01:59.745
Yes.

01:59.828 --> 02:00.913
- Who is this guy?
- An extra.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.039
I'm an actor.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.081
Are you mistaken?

02:03.207 --> 02:04.917
How can you let him touch my machine?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.919
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
I just went to toilet.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.961
so I asked him to do the rehearsal.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.716
Find someone who knows how to act,
we need one urgently.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.426
- Let me do it.
- You?

02:15.511 --> 02:17.346
Show me the expression of "nervous".

02:17.596 --> 02:20.182
There're several kinds
of nervous expression.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.351
The one on the face of a husband
whose wife is delivering a baby.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.814
The baby is given birth.
But the wife is dead.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.943
The baby calls him dad, he's a genius.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.654
His dick is on his head, he's abnormal.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.032
He wins Mark Six...first prize!

02:37.866 --> 02:39.159
His son is dead...

02:40.160 --> 02:41.453
His wife comes back to life.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.163
His wife comes back to life.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.582
No more response,
if one is struck too hard emotionally...

02:45.791 --> 02:49.628
he will enter a state of mental coma,
he'll show no response.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.713
Is there another guy?

02:51.797 --> 02:54.800
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.093
I don't know what you were doing.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.470
Was there anything wrong
with my expression?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.389
I've said I didn't know
what you were doing.

03:00.514 --> 03:04.226
Aunt Ha, none of your extras
is smart enough.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.686
All these extras are above standard.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.730
Sunny, is it done?

03:09.398 --> 03:11.149
Everyone is waiting.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.485
OK...Director, it'll soon be done...

03:14.152 --> 03:15.863
- You, go and change your clothes.
- Thanks.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.240
- Stand in this position.
- Got it.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.951
- Lighting.
- Lighting is ready.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.578
- Settings.
- Settings ready.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.121
Actors.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.206
Stand-by.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.416
Sorry, Director.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.668
According to the character of my role.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.005
I want to play my role
with a bit naughtiness...

03:33.172 --> 03:35.132
But contradiction. Will this be better?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.594
OK, Speed.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.262
Speed.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.390
- Scene 3. Shot 4, take 1.
- Action!

04:57.297 --> 04:58.507
Cut!

04:59.132 --> 05:00.175
What is it?

05:00.676 --> 05:01.885
What's wrong with the guy behind.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.262
He's supposed to be dead.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.723
- What are you doing? Aunt Ha!
- What is it? Brother Sunny?

05:06.849 --> 05:08.267
What is your extra up to?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.061
How come you are still alive?

05:11.270 --> 05:14.982
As I said I'd play my role
with a bit naughtiness.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.694
So subconsciously
I don't want to die yet.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.906
You must pretend to be dead.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.825
Actually, I was dying.

05:24.992 --> 05:28.203
If you give me a bit more time,
I'll die eventually.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.790
Do you know how many frames of film
are there in one second?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.500
24 frames, Sister Cuckoo.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.003
Do you know
how long is the shot just then?

05:36.503 --> 05:37.713
I guess it about one minute.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.257
Do you know as you didn't want to die...

05:40.424 --> 05:43.343
that you've wasted how many seconds,
how many frames and how much money

05:43.552 --> 05:46.221
and how much time
and effort of everyone here?

05:46.722 --> 05:48.140
Are you fooling around here?

05:48.682 --> 05:52.352
I'm begging you, you'd better
find a professional extra for this role.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.688
Get someone smarter and shoot again!

05:55.189 --> 05:56.523
You'd better be smart!

05:56.648 --> 05:58.400
Go home and think about
when exactly you want to die.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.401
OK, Brother Sunny.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.362
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

06:02.487 --> 06:05.449
Don't ask me again, I really don't know
what you were doing.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.075
- Then I...
- Get lost.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.578
You remind me I must go to a meeting
of Neighbour Welfare Association.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.495
I'll be right back.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.080
You don't have to come back.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.459
I'm begging you, stop making trouble.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.839
Let the director watch your performance?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.800
Director, what kind of performance?

06:23.926 --> 06:26.094
You are shot to dead, ready.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.221
Action!

06:31.517 --> 06:32.518
Was it OK, Director?

06:32.684 --> 06:34.728
This is it, go and change your clothes.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.355
- Go ahead.
- Thanks...

06:38.106 --> 06:40.025
Where did you learn acting, man?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.694
- I've never learnt it.
- You're a real genius.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.614
You can make it if you work hard.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.035
Why are you still standing here?
Fuck off!

06:55.040 --> 06:55.833
What are you doing here?

06:55.958 --> 06:58.335
Unit manager,
I want to get a lunch box only.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.670
It's not yet lunch time.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.673
- As I'm leaving now, so I...
- Then you just go!

07:03.924 --> 07:05.968
Do you know why it's not yet lunch time?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.680
Just because of you, bastard,
you didn't want to die!

07:09.847 --> 07:11.390
And now everyone is working
and starving.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.100
I haven't eaten as well!

07:14.434 --> 07:18.564
Do you want to have lunch?
Share your lunch with that puppy!

07:21.733 --> 07:28.907
Shit, you're a dump of shit.
Your life is cheaper than ants.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.911
I ride a Mercedes,
you pick your nostril.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.665
You want to have lunch?
You better eat shit!

07:48.886 --> 07:52.514
Why did you just come back now?

07:56.268 --> 07:58.729
- You guys have lunch already?
- Shut up, get me a ping pong racket.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.439
OK!

08:03.734 --> 08:06.486
Where's the ping pong ball?
Get me one now.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.071
Quick.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.449
- Right away.
- Hurry.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.203
This is Neighbour Welfare Association.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.289
You mustn't be late,
many people are waiting for you.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.790
Hello, Aunt Ha?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.918
Nothing, I want to check the time
for tomorrow notice.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.002
You haven't for tomorrow.

08:22.085 --> 08:22.878
What about the day after tomorrow?

08:22.961 --> 08:24.505
Nothing for the day after tomorrow
and so on.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.383
Aunt Ha, where are you?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.885
None of your business, what do you want?

09:12.094 --> 09:15.472
I check with you again, is there notice
for role without dialogue?

09:15.681 --> 09:17.140
No.

09:17.266 --> 09:20.769
- Any role that can't be seen clearly?
- No.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.855
Any role that can't he seen completely?

09:23.021 --> 09:26.233
I can't see you now. Don't trouble me.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.312
- Aunt Ha, where are you?
- Go to hell!

11:06.959 --> 11:08.168
Dear fellows.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.256
The play "Thunder Storm" is adapted from
a well-known Chinese classic literature.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.174
You guys all know it well.

11:14.299 --> 11:18.011
Tomorrow, I'll be leading actor,
you guys want to see it, right?

11:18.762 --> 11:20.389
So, I'll see you guys tomorrow then.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.767
Kelly, is there anything to do
after dinner tomorrow?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.269
Taking a dump.

11:25.686 --> 11:29.106
Come and watch Uncle San's play
after taking a dump, it'll be fun.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.400
Remember to bring your dad and mom too.

11:31.567 --> 11:35.404
If they don't come, you can cry,
spit around.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.656
Do whatever you can until they come,
then you'll be a good girl.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.533
I pamper you, Kelly.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.955
Kelly, if I don't see you tomorrow.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.541
You'll result like this doll.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.753
You get that?

11:56.258 --> 11:58.719
Uncle Chi, the play "Thunder Storm"
will be on show tomorrow night.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.095
Have you studied the script well?

12:00.179 --> 12:02.931
Yes, don't worry.
I can even compose a song.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.309
Old Master sings
whenever he sees the maid.

12:05.434 --> 12:10.814
You're beautiful...

12:10.939 --> 12:13.317
Uncle Chi, I'm the one
who sing the theme song.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.278
And the role of "Old Master"
you play is a Chinese as well.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.989
When the maid sees the Old Master,
she will sing...

12:19.156 --> 12:24.661
You're so handsome, you're so smart...

12:24.828 --> 12:30.209
- Thank you much, please to...
- Uncle Chi, please don't...

12:30.375 --> 12:32.336
- I accept you...
- Are you OK?

12:32.503 --> 12:34.254
Think positive, Uncle Chi.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.840
Someone helps me, come on.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.051
Master Hung, morning.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.677
My play "Thunder Storm"
will soon be showing.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.846
Shall we make another rehearsal?

12:42.971 --> 12:46.266
Do I need to rehearsal? "Thunder Storm"
is about righteous, I knew it.

12:46.475 --> 12:49.061
We're triad society member,
we only talk about two things.

12:49.186 --> 12:52.523
First, about righteous,
second, about money.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.983
I'll talk about righteous first.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.737
"Righteous" is good, but we mustn't
ignore the love line of the story.

12:58.862 --> 13:03.075
Because the role you play
will finally be struck to death.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.952
Talking about "struck" (chopping),
let me tell you...

13:05.118 --> 13:08.705
There are two kinds of "struck"
(chopping) in our world.

13:08.789 --> 13:14.086
First, it is "dragging".
Second is "stabbing".

13:14.253 --> 13:21.218
Look, this scar was dragged by knife.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.262
While "stabbing" is like this.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.393
This scoundrel is new comer, sorry,
he shows no expression.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.603
"Stabbing" is like this.

13:33.397 --> 13:36.191
Be serious,
let us know if you feel the pain, OK?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.487
Your acting is lousy.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.656
Brother Sau, teaching him for me.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.075
Talking about "pain"...

13:45.200 --> 13:49.788
according to Stanisslavski,
master of acting from Russia.

13:49.955 --> 13:54.293
Pain is transmitted from your body to
the inside, and outside again.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.461
Let try one more time.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.384
Look, it's much better this time.

14:02.718 --> 14:05.262
Isn't it? He acts much better now.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.972
Let's try one more time.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.478
Right, a little bit more, more,
being stabbed.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.360
Maybe I can help you this way.

14:33.499 --> 14:36.668
This is working, tears come out now.

14:38.754 --> 14:42.549
Look clearly, remember this expression,
remember this feeling.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.136
Do remember this, get it?

14:46.428 --> 14:47.554
Let's go.

14:47.596 --> 14:48.931
What about own "Thunder Storm" tomorrow.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.307
No rehearsal needed for "Thunder Storm".

14:50.516 --> 14:54.019
We will come for sure,
promise is a promise!

14:54.686 --> 14:58.065
I'll bring hundreds of people
to watch your play as well.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.692
- It's a deal.
- Just don't worry.

15:00.859 --> 15:01.985
Faster.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.283
Get into position.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.702
Granny, you stepped on someone.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.789
I didn't step on anyone.

15:13.956 --> 15:17.125
You just couldn't feel when you
stepped on him, look at his foot.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.670
Yes, he's sweating as well.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.506
Give me some money and I'll
send him to the hospital.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.049
I have no money.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.176
Look at him, he's dying.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.053
I only have $100 left.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.513
Give me, that $100.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.349
Let's move!

15:38.230 --> 15:40.190
Granny, you've dropped some money.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.067
Really good luck.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.611
Sir...

15:44.820 --> 15:46.864
- Are you free tomorrow?
- What is it?

15:47.072 --> 15:49.199
"Thunder Storm" is on show
at Neighbour Theatre.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.910
"Thunder Storm"? Good!

17:10.071 --> 17:11.698
Miss, what's your name?

17:11.865 --> 17:12.741
Piu, and you?

17:12.950 --> 17:15.493
This is your name, really?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.746
Whatever I told you,
just call me Piu, idiot?

17:17.954 --> 17:19.580
You're really a student?

17:19.705 --> 17:23.252
Sure I am, I'm still a virgin,
isn't that great?

17:23.627 --> 17:24.837
It's your luck, Uncle.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.380
Let's play 'Chai Fist'?

17:26.839 --> 17:27.631
I don't know how to play it.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.008
You don't know 'Chai Fist'?
Have you been educated?

17:30.133 --> 17:31.218
Fanny, come here.

17:31.802 --> 17:36.014
Your belly is really big!
Mind you can't get into the coffin.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.891
'Chai Fist', Bingo!

17:38.058 --> 17:40.435
Come on, relax, have some fun.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.145
Cheer up, why did draw your face?
Your parents are dead or something?

17:42.354 --> 17:43.814
Chai Fist', Bingo!

17:43.981 --> 17:46.567
Triangle, rectangle, four!

17:46.942 --> 17:48.026
Good, I'll drink!

18:01.123 --> 18:03.584
Tonight is College Girls'
First Love Evening.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.962
So please mind your words,
do behave like a student girl.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.840
If clients complain about you again,
then I can't help you anymore.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.885
What College Girl? Just a damned trick.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.053
If I can be a college girl,
I won't be working here.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.471
You believe you did nothing wrong?

18:16.638 --> 18:18.891
Mamasan, the man at Table 7
is really ugly.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.726
I can't stand it and
I am not doing business with him.

18:20.809 --> 18:23.270
Do you all want to
be selecting on clients?

18:23.395 --> 18:24.688
No...

18:26.398 --> 18:27.691
You're too much.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.736
You are not professional,
you can concentrate on one single.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.154
One single spot?

18:32.321 --> 18:34.990
If that man is ugly,
you needn't look at him.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.784
If his ears are pretty,
just stare at his ears.

18:37.993 --> 18:41.997
If his mouth is ugly but the teeth
are nice, just look at his teeth.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.416
So you new comer are really ignorant.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.171
Let me deal with him.
Come on, watch what I'll do.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.714
Be smart.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.383
Hi!

18:57.971 --> 18:59.389
You're pretty.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.976
What's your name, Boss?

19:03.560 --> 19:04.978
My name is Pierre.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.856
It's a French name.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.528
Are everyone says I look like
a Frenchman, so I get a French name.

19:14.738 --> 19:18.492
If you can't pronounce that well,
just call me Pi or Erre.

19:23.038 --> 19:23.914
What's on?

19:24.122 --> 19:27.793
You used to be proud,
now you get a lesson.

19:28.293 --> 19:31.296
You can't blame me, he's a real rarity.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.423
Have you seen anyone
put a cockroach on his head?

19:33.549 --> 19:34.550
What's the problem?

19:34.758 --> 19:37.511
Look at LuLu,
she's playing with that cockroach now.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.433
I admit failure.

19:43.642 --> 19:46.144
OK, from now on,
you won't have clients to sit at.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.314
You'll be bored to death.

19:49.565 --> 19:51.316
You're all like this.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.443
Connie, come and teach her for me.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.656
You're not amateur, you should know
you must act in front of clients.

19:57.823 --> 20:00.701
But your problem is: you acting stinks.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.035
I can do nothing about it.

20:02.161 --> 20:05.372
I hear someone teaches acting for free.

20:05.581 --> 20:06.790
I'll take you to see him.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.876
Teaches acting?

20:15.090 --> 20:17.467
- Hey, men.
- Yes!

20:17.593 --> 20:19.636
Hurry up, start working.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.183
You again?

20:24.266 --> 20:25.058
Morning, Brother Sunny.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.894
Aunt Ha!

20:27.102 --> 20:28.312
I'm looking for him too.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.564
I haven't given you a notice,
what brings you here?

20:30.731 --> 20:33.734
Remember last time that you asked me
to think about the ways to die.

20:33.817 --> 20:37.112
I've thought over and
I have some new ideas now,

20:37.321 --> 20:40.449
and I believe my performance
will make you satisfied.

20:40.699 --> 20:43.869
I would have killed you in the past.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.371
Talking about knife,
it's different from a gun.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.333
The position of the wound
is usually under the armpit, here.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.629
The wound is a bit bigger,
and the face will twist more.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.715
If you're betrayed by your own friends,
you will even...

20:57.424 --> 21:00.719
I didn't expect...it's you...

21:01.261 --> 21:02.262
Get lost!

21:02.763 --> 21:04.097
Brother Sunny, I...

21:04.348 --> 21:07.851
I just want to act,
give me a chance please.

21:07.976 --> 21:08.977
Do you love standing here?

21:09.102 --> 21:11.146
OK, stand here, I won't pay you a dime.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.233
I'll act even if you don't pay me,
I only want a lunch box.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.568
But lunch box costs money too, beat it!

21:16.652 --> 21:17.861
Sunny.

21:18.862 --> 21:19.988
What is it, Martial Art Director?

21:20.113 --> 21:23.951
It's bad to use this mannequin
to disguise as a dead man.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.869
Figure it out, we're in a hurry!

21:26.036 --> 21:27.579
Yes, OK...got it.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.252
Thank you, Brother Sunny.

21:33.502 --> 21:34.378
Only a lunch box.

21:34.628 --> 21:36.547
No problem,
should I put some make up on?

21:36.672 --> 21:37.673
Put it on now.

21:40.926 --> 21:42.261
Director, the actors are ready.

21:42.553 --> 21:43.554
Actors are all ready.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.013
Action!

22:25.804 --> 22:28.056
Cockroach...

22:28.265 --> 22:29.349
Let's help sister Cuckoo.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.852
Cockroach!

22:38.400 --> 22:39.193
Go to hell!

22:39.401 --> 22:40.819
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid.

22:40.944 --> 22:43.197
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid,
it's OK now.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.364
Director, can we cut now?

22:44.573 --> 22:45.782
It's still running?

22:46.241 --> 22:47.367
Cut!

22:47.534 --> 22:49.161
- OK.
- Are you OK?

22:49.328 --> 22:51.997
Must you do all these
to kill a cockroach!

22:52.498 --> 22:53.832
Let's see if he's alright?

22:54.208 --> 22:56.668
I'm fine, Sister Cuckoo,
thanks for your concerns.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.337
Why don't you move at all?

22:58.795 --> 23:03.967
I didn't move
since Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.844
So I mustn't move.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.516
Do you hear that...

23:10.933 --> 23:14.061
He keeps on acting since the Director
hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

23:14.144 --> 23:17.356
This is what I always tell you:
professionalism.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.068
What's your name?

23:21.652 --> 23:23.278
I'm called Wan Tin Sau.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.240
- Yee, give him a cup of coffee.
- Yes.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.991
- Get his phone number for me.
- Yes.

23:28.116 --> 23:31.078
You...work in my team from now on.

23:31.662 --> 23:33.121
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.

23:33.789 --> 23:35.541
- Is this shot OK?
- Yes.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.417
Weapon comes.

23:38.377 --> 23:39.670
- Sunny.
- Yes.

23:39.795 --> 23:42.798
I am telling you,
even extras are important.

23:42.881 --> 23:46.802
The one who played the father,
we mustn't use him again.

23:47.010 --> 23:47.886
Got it, Sister Cuckoo.

23:47.970 --> 23:51.557
Sister Cuckoo,
I am the one who played the Father.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.687
In fact, it is like this...

23:59.606 --> 24:00.816
Fine...

24:00.941 --> 24:02.901
Let me clean it for you,
towel, get the towel.

24:05.571 --> 24:07.614
- Sister Cuckoo!
- Watch out!

24:16.540 --> 24:18.458
Sister Cuckoo, are you alright?

24:18.709 --> 24:19.835
Don't touch.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.047
Don't touch!

24:31.013 --> 24:32.431
Very pretty.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.644
Sister Cuckoo!

25:42.376 --> 25:44.628
Security guard, is there someone here
who teaches acting?

25:44.795 --> 25:48.298
I've been in the field of art for ages.

25:48.465 --> 25:52.010
Whether it's movie or TV,
I'm experienced.

25:52.177 --> 25:55.347
I was the creative director
in Amusement Park Theatre.

25:55.514 --> 25:58.600
So I can sing and dance.

25:59.226 --> 26:00.769
You mean you are the instructor here?

26:00.978 --> 26:04.773
Well, many people here
love theatre and play.

26:04.940 --> 26:07.401
They love studying plays with me.

26:07.568 --> 26:09.319
Those people introduce us here indeed.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.821
OK, this way please.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.865
It's you?

26:13.031 --> 26:15.993
Didn't you play in that film...that...

26:16.160 --> 26:17.035
The stupid man standing behind, falls
after stepping on a banana peel?

26:19.663 --> 26:21.582
You noticed my performance too?

26:22.249 --> 26:26.211
You idiot! Only an idiot will fall
after stepping on a banana peel.

26:26.420 --> 26:29.548
- Why don't you go dying?
- Thanks.

26:29.798 --> 26:32.968
- Are you really that stupid?
- You're flattering me.

26:33.135 --> 26:35.721
You damned extra, you are...

26:35.888 --> 26:39.600
In fact, I am an actor. That way please.

26:39.892 --> 26:41.018
Damned extra.

26:43.812 --> 26:45.647
What can I do for you?

26:45.731 --> 26:48.108
Frankly,
we're hostesses of a night club.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.443
I can tell.

26:49.735 --> 26:52.613
We're holding "College Girls'
First Love Evening" right now.

26:52.779 --> 26:56.700
These girls dare to say they don't
have the feeling of first love at all.

26:57.826 --> 26:59.536
How can you work like this?

26:59.828 --> 27:03.040
First love was shown at the stage
when we where babies.

27:03.165 --> 27:08.212
Say, when a baby sees a comforter,
he wants to suck it.

27:08.378 --> 27:10.923
This is a kind of love.

27:11.548 --> 27:14.635
Why did you suck a comforter?
You damned extra.

27:14.968 --> 27:17.221
In fact, I am an actor.

27:17.763 --> 27:20.098
Well, so why did you talk about
sucking a comforter?

27:20.599 --> 27:23.602
I'm going to explain everything to you.

27:23.894 --> 27:25.729
OK, let's explain it.

27:25.938 --> 27:30.317
First, you must dress up
like a college girls,

27:30.442 --> 27:32.778
about dialogue, at some vital points...

27:32.945 --> 27:36.448
such as: I love you, I hate you, etc.

27:37.658 --> 27:42.496
It'll be more impressive
if you have some tears in your eyes.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.206
Just like this.

27:49.753 --> 27:52.881
Do you see? That teardrop...

27:54.424 --> 27:56.385
Good, the teardrop is inside the eyes.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.347
Where is the teardrop? You damned extra.

28:01.139 --> 28:03.600
In fact, I am an actor.

28:06.520 --> 28:10.524
You might need something to help you
since you've no experience,

28:10.816 --> 28:13.986
and the simplest way is to eat Wasabi.

28:14.695 --> 28:16.738
Wasabi? What are you talking about?

28:16.989 --> 28:19.658
Must we be fooled by this damned extra?

28:19.950 --> 28:22.411
Miss, if you must call me an extra,

28:22.578 --> 28:25.581
you don't need to add 'damned'
in front of it.

28:29.585 --> 28:31.545
In fact, being club girls...

28:31.670 --> 28:34.131
If you can show some respect
to the others, then...

28:34.298 --> 28:36.258
- What are you calling us?
- Excuse me.

28:37.676 --> 28:39.219
Forget it, we are club girls indeed.

28:39.386 --> 28:40.804
I just don't like him
calling me that way.

28:43.265 --> 28:44.892
She's always like this, never mind her.

28:50.564 --> 28:51.982
It's OK...

28:55.986 --> 28:57.487
I've asked you not to stir up trouble!

28:59.490 --> 29:00.824
It's OK...

29:07.789 --> 29:09.082
It's OK...

29:09.833 --> 29:12.920
Why must you still behave like this?
Don't panic, it's alright.

29:15.339 --> 29:17.174
- Don't panic, it's alright.
- Club girls?

29:18.050 --> 29:20.719
It's alright...Don't panic,
take it easy, it's alright.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.930
How could I know he's so amusing?

29:23.138 --> 29:24.890
I brought you there as I thought
he charged for nothing.

29:25.098 --> 29:26.808
If you hadn't block my way, I'd have...

29:27.017 --> 29:29.978
Please, beware what you say
to the clients.

29:30.312 --> 29:31.730
- Go out...
- I'm sorry.

29:31.939 --> 29:33.774
What's going on?
This is a big night club.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.317
Get lost, I'm sorry.

29:35.526 --> 29:37.486
- Are there other hostesses?
- Yes, they're coming soon.

29:37.611 --> 29:38.737
Connie, come here.

29:38.904 --> 29:39.696
What is it, Mama Debra?

29:39.905 --> 29:41.448
Master Lung is here and he's drunk.

29:41.573 --> 29:44.034
He thought he's being dumped
and he wants his first lover back.

29:44.201 --> 29:46.036
All the girls here are college girls,
they'll suit him.

29:46.370 --> 29:49.331
Look,
he has scanned almost all my girls.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.333
But none of them suits his taste,
he's nuts.

29:51.500 --> 29:55.546
Look at his money, it's piled up.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.339
- Have you gone inside?
- Not yet.

29:57.548 --> 30:00.217
Wait here for a while.
Go and send some more girls here.

30:02.052 --> 30:03.679
I have so much money.

30:04.221 --> 30:06.181
Come and get it if you can.

30:06.723 --> 30:09.935
I want my first lover.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.397
First lover!

30:16.650 --> 30:17.651
You wanna try?

30:17.985 --> 30:21.488
I'll give it a shot, sometimes it's hard
to tell the taste of a rich man.

30:23.824 --> 30:25.033
Get lost.

30:29.121 --> 30:31.874
Hurry up, be smart.

30:33.584 --> 30:36.962
Master Lung, here come the beauties.
Say Hi to Master Lung.

30:38.005 --> 30:39.590
Boss.

30:42.593 --> 30:43.594
Get lost!

30:45.971 --> 30:47.806
- Master Lung, don't get mad.
- Go away!

30:48.724 --> 30:50.142
None of them is pretty!

30:50.851 --> 30:54.354
They are not sincere,
I want my first lover!

30:54.563 --> 31:01.737
First lover...

31:07.701 --> 31:09.411
They're all here for money!

31:14.917 --> 31:16.960
I am sincere.

31:20.339 --> 31:23.091
I really love you.

31:25.636 --> 31:29.890
Mary, I'll give you anything you want.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.560
I can give you
all the money on the table...

31:34.436 --> 31:40.234
as long as you don't leave me, Mary.

32:06.802 --> 32:09.054
- What is it?
- Are you alright?

32:09.429 --> 32:11.890
I've hit you hard, sorry.

32:12.057 --> 32:14.643
If that table wasn't there
and I could kick you,

32:14.893 --> 32:16.186
I wouldn't have been defeated by you.

32:16.311 --> 32:19.314
I'm not here to fight with you,
I'm here to learn acting from you.

32:19.523 --> 32:20.732
Go away.

32:25.195 --> 32:28.073
To some honest friends
who have the same interest as I do.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.743
I'll be more than willing to teach them.
Just a second.

32:44.923 --> 32:48.218
I'm coming, 1, 2, 2 and a half, 3.

33:11.492 --> 33:13.327
Must it take you so long for make up?
You damned...

33:13.494 --> 33:14.495
Don't again!

33:14.703 --> 33:17.581
- Your tie is high-classed.
- Thanks.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.417
Since I've taken your money,
I should act accordingly.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.669
- Where's the ping pong racket?
- Under the table.

33:23.045 --> 33:24.671
There're many people here,
let's go over there.

33:26.173 --> 33:28.634
I'm Wan Tin Sau, and you?

33:29.343 --> 33:30.761
Lau Piu Piu.

33:31.011 --> 33:32.304
What do you want to learn?

33:32.429 --> 33:34.264
How to pamper
those bastards in the night club.

33:34.473 --> 33:39.102
The first love feeling of college girls
must be built from the base.

33:39.269 --> 33:41.939
You can take me as your client,
and greet me first.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.357
Boss, want some fist games?

33:43.440 --> 33:45.817
Don't call me "Boss",
you're college girl now.

33:45.984 --> 33:47.569
You can say Good Morning,

33:47.653 --> 33:49.404
or Morning, Sir.

33:49.905 --> 33:51.114
Good morning, Sir.

33:51.406 --> 33:53.784
Try to lower your head a little bit,
pretend to be shy.

33:54.034 --> 33:57.746
Let your client touches your chin
and raise your head and then say.

33:58.288 --> 33:59.581
Morning, Sir.

33:59.748 --> 34:01.458
Your regards are bad, again.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.961
Give me glistened regards.

34:04.294 --> 34:05.712
Morning, Sir.

34:06.046 --> 34:10.884
Too glistened now, I'll faint, again.
Take it easy.

34:14.388 --> 34:15.597
Morning, Sir.

34:15.764 --> 34:18.308
These are eyes of dead body,
you'll scare others to death.

34:18.516 --> 34:23.605
Again. Be natural.

34:24.565 --> 34:26.024
Morning, Sir.

34:35.117 --> 34:36.034
Good!

34:36.118 --> 34:40.121
Now let's discuss about your action,
say, hugging.

34:40.455 --> 34:42.498
Hug me with your way.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.049
What for?

34:51.675 --> 34:52.885
What for?

34:53.092 --> 34:55.679
You needn't lock others
with your thigh every time.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.640
- Sorry, my job requires this.
- You must stop doing that.

34:58.765 --> 35:04.188
Being a college girl,
you needn't always take initiation.

35:04.396 --> 35:09.401
You can act shyly
so that men will hug you.

35:09.693 --> 35:11.195
What do you mean by shy?

35:12.154 --> 35:14.615
Like this.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.409
- Like biting a quail?
- Act on.

35:20.037 --> 35:22.706
Right, when men see you biting a quail,

35:22.915 --> 35:24.875
they'll naturally hold and hug you.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.880
Now you can put your head
on their shoulders.

35:40.390 --> 35:41.808
What for?

35:42.976 --> 35:44.603
Excuse me, my job requires this.

35:44.770 --> 35:46.522
You must stop doing that!

35:46.897 --> 35:48.524
Superficially it's all.

35:48.690 --> 35:52.194
If we go further, I must then ask you
about your first love.

35:53.403 --> 35:54.738
I never have first love.

35:55.030 --> 35:56.782
Everyone has first love.

35:56.907 --> 35:58.242
I said I never have one.

35:59.743 --> 36:02.329
You must have some unforgettable memory.

36:02.663 --> 36:03.664
No.

36:13.924 --> 36:16.510
Or you must have heard someone
say something you can never forget.

36:17.928 --> 36:19.054
Never!

36:19.179 --> 36:21.139
I hope I can be with you forever.

36:21.932 --> 36:24.726
Promise me, let me take care of you
for the rest of your life.

36:44.079 --> 36:46.748
Then you must have
unforgettable experience.

36:47.624 --> 36:48.709
Never!

36:52.421 --> 36:55.591
Being club girl? Didn't say
you'll take care of me?

36:56.800 --> 36:58.760
How come I have money
if you don't work as club girl?

36:58.927 --> 37:01.054
How can I take care of you
if I have no money?

37:02.931 --> 37:07.060
Now, imagine
I'm your first boyfriend lover.

37:19.907 --> 37:24.328
Sau, on the night of your play,
I was engaged in a transaction.

37:24.495 --> 37:27.164
So I was too busy to come, sorry.

37:27.414 --> 37:29.458
- Was there good response?
- Sure.

37:29.666 --> 37:32.753
It's good then.
I will surely come next time.

37:33.587 --> 37:39.718
Someone're shooing kids karaoke,
you aren't one of them?

37:39.885 --> 37:42.012
I've things to see you, excuse me.

37:42.221 --> 37:45.432
Take me new boy
to collect protection money for me.

37:45.682 --> 37:48.685
Help me improve his appearance...
About the way he speaks?

37:48.810 --> 37:53.565
Right, that's it,
you won't refuse my request, right?

37:55.442 --> 37:56.527
Thanks for teaching me.

37:58.987 --> 38:00.113
Over there.

38:00.364 --> 38:02.407
Being a triad member...

38:02.574 --> 38:04.701
you must have a unique appearance.

38:04.910 --> 38:06.662
It's right
you have a gold chain with you.

38:06.829 --> 38:11.375
You must try to look furious and severe.
Try it.

38:12.918 --> 38:16.213
More furious. Show some anger.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.299
Wrath.

38:26.223 --> 38:27.516
Throw that nibble away.

38:27.724 --> 38:29.977
This is it,
you know what you're going to say?

38:30.102 --> 38:30.894
I seem to know.

38:31.019 --> 38:33.480
Good, I'll remind you from time to time
in this dim place.

38:42.156 --> 38:43.866
Tong, over here a bit, right, cheer up.

38:44.032 --> 38:45.951
- Shooting a movie?
- What is it?

38:48.203 --> 38:49.288
I forget already.

38:58.255 --> 38:59.673
You know, HK is in economic recession.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.509
And being hit by financial storm,
it's all because of the 'Ross'.

39:02.718 --> 39:03.719
There are many factors.

39:03.886 --> 39:06.138
Now the S.E.
Asia collapses in economics...

39:06.346 --> 39:08.891
and that infects HK too.

39:09.099 --> 39:11.768
Those enterprises suffer much.

39:12.019 --> 39:16.773
The worse is there'll be
global economics recession soon.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.400
You have a view in economics.

39:18.609 --> 39:20.736
I majored Economics in HKU.

39:20.944 --> 39:22.362
Did you? I graduated this year.

39:22.488 --> 39:25.365
Did you? I graduated in 1996,
this is my name card.

39:25.824 --> 39:27.993
- You're my senior, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.829
- How come you shoot kids karaoke?
- I can't help.

39:36.210 --> 39:37.211
What are you doing now?

39:37.377 --> 39:39.713
Nothing, I fool with triad members.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.216
Seeing you shooting movie here,
I come to collect protection money.

39:43.050 --> 39:45.636
Brother Kei,
someone collects protection money.

39:47.346 --> 39:48.764
Who collects protection money?

39:58.565 --> 40:00.400
- Economics in HK is now...
- Is it you?

40:03.111 --> 40:04.321
Good.

40:10.619 --> 40:12.579
Bastard,
what triad groups are you come from?

40:35.727 --> 40:37.145
Dare you to fool me?

40:48.198 --> 40:49.408
Fix him!

40:52.244 --> 40:54.371
Kill you!

40:54.997 --> 40:58.167
Go to hell! Bastard...

41:01.295 --> 41:04.173
Dare you play with my bird?
Don't you know me?

41:04.923 --> 41:06.884
Don't come near...

41:08.135 --> 41:09.052
It hurts...

41:09.261 --> 41:12.681
Don't talk with me,
pretend we're at a duel.

41:13.265 --> 41:15.851
Make a call...pretend calling for help.

41:20.397 --> 41:22.024
I want to go home.

41:22.149 --> 41:24.193
You must act on until I shout cut.

41:24.359 --> 41:27.654
- You must be profession.
- I want to go home.

41:27.779 --> 41:28.697
It's a day.

41:30.407 --> 41:31.492
They're gone.

41:31.867 --> 41:33.410
Don't be afraid, they're gone, all gone.

41:33.827 --> 41:36.830
Take a chopper and a rush there,
get some fame.

41:49.927 --> 41:50.719
What's wrong?

41:50.844 --> 41:52.387
That scoundrel is still there.

41:52.554 --> 41:56.058
Concentrate! you're scoundrel too,
show some anger!

41:56.225 --> 41:58.143
I want to eat ice-cream.

41:58.644 --> 42:01.104
Bastard! Show some anger!

42:16.870 --> 42:18.205
You needn't do that.

42:32.386 --> 42:34.137
Forget it, I fear you now.

42:42.354 --> 42:44.481
What's up? You acted very well.

42:46.984 --> 42:48.193
What has happened?

42:48.360 --> 42:50.404
He acted really well to get this.

42:51.029 --> 42:52.573
He managed to collect $20.

42:52.698 --> 42:54.199
Why are you still crying?

42:54.366 --> 42:56.785
You managed to get $20 protection money
in front of a temple.

42:56.994 --> 42:58.620
You're making a fame for yourself.

42:58.745 --> 43:00.164
You do look like a hero.

43:00.372 --> 43:03.667
Keep the image and use it
to collect protection money now.

43:03.709 --> 43:06.086
Brother Sau, you're competent, great!

43:06.253 --> 43:07.045
You're flattering me.

43:07.129 --> 43:10.007
Let's get a feast, with this $20.

43:12.259 --> 43:15.262
What are you laughing at?
Keep this image, got it?

43:15.470 --> 43:18.640
- Stop laughing! Cry!
- Stop laughing! Cry!

43:18.932 --> 43:21.310
Be good, cry, cry now!

43:21.435 --> 43:22.769
What are you laughing at! Cry now!

43:22.853 --> 43:24.563
That under-graduate hold two choppers.

43:24.813 --> 43:27.691
And rushes over
while crying and shouting.

43:27.858 --> 43:30.736
He's crying loudly.

43:30.861 --> 43:34.156
He is capable
to play the spirit of a triad member.

43:34.364 --> 43:35.991
Thanks for his persistence,

43:36.116 --> 43:38.452
He managed to get $20
as a protection money.

43:38.577 --> 43:39.661
What are you talking about?

43:39.912 --> 43:41.747
Persistence, Aunt Ha.

43:41.872 --> 43:43.916
I believe that I'm a good actor,
do me a favour please.

43:44.082 --> 43:46.001
I have new experience
about holding choppers.

43:46.210 --> 43:47.628
I'd play well in a kung fu movie.

43:47.711 --> 43:50.380
What?
You've brought enough trouble to me.

43:50.547 --> 43:53.425
How dare you asking me for help?
Go away!

43:56.386 --> 43:57.804
Sorry, Brother Sunny, he's leaving now.

43:57.971 --> 44:00.641
I've looking for you.
Make up and get ready.

44:00.891 --> 44:02.017
Thanks!

44:03.185 --> 44:04.520
Director, we've found the stunt man.

44:04.686 --> 44:06.522
You said you can't find one just then?
You're wasting my time!

44:06.688 --> 44:07.689
I've found one now.

44:07.856 --> 44:08.774
You have no problem?

44:08.941 --> 44:12.027
No problem, I'll try my best to be
the stunt man for Sister Cuckoo.

44:12.236 --> 44:13.320
Director, no problem.

44:13.695 --> 44:15.155
Light the fire.

44:15.280 --> 44:16.073
Director.

44:16.281 --> 44:17.616
Beside responding with the hot fire,

44:17.783 --> 44:19.827
Can I show an expression
of cool loneliness?

44:20.118 --> 44:21.119
As you like,

44:21.286 --> 44:24.081
As long as you don't turn your face
to the camera, get it?

44:24.164 --> 44:25.207
Got it.

44:25.249 --> 44:27.709
Light the fire, just don't move.

44:30.087 --> 44:31.421
Ready.

44:31.713 --> 44:33.549
Who put the pigeons here?

44:33.715 --> 44:34.800
Director, I put them here intentionally.

44:34.967 --> 44:36.718
There're pigeons here in our last shot.

44:36.844 --> 44:39.930
If the pigeons fly,
they'll stir up the fire.

44:40.138 --> 44:42.057
- Take them away.
- Director...

44:43.100 --> 44:45.561
The mood of this shot will be better
if the pigeons are there.

44:45.727 --> 44:47.020
How much better?

44:48.397 --> 44:51.692
It's hard to say,
it's something abstract.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.318
Anyway, the mood will be better.

44:53.861 --> 44:55.195
Put them up and let's see the effect.

44:57.531 --> 44:59.449
That stunt man mustn't turn his head!

44:59.992 --> 45:01.285
Director, how do you like it?

45:01.743 --> 45:02.953
It's a bit better.

45:03.370 --> 45:07.708
Let's try the effect
with the pigeon's head towards me.

45:10.085 --> 45:13.046
Now put the pigeon's tail towards me.

45:15.632 --> 45:17.885
Take it away. Ready.

45:18.302 --> 45:19.928
It's better without the pigeons,
take it away.

45:20.596 --> 45:21.805
Ready.

45:21.972 --> 45:24.016
Where's my lighter?

45:27.269 --> 45:28.478
Man, bring me a lighter?

45:28.604 --> 45:29.646
Director, here it is.

45:29.771 --> 45:30.981
- Really?
- Yes.

45:31.190 --> 45:32.608
- It works?
- Yes.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.778
Hurry, quick, ready!

45:37.404 --> 45:39.531
Ready, keep your posture, don't move.

45:39.698 --> 45:41.783
Roll, action!

45:43.327 --> 45:44.536
What is it?

45:49.666 --> 45:52.044
What's wrong with you?
You screwed up every time!

45:52.503 --> 45:53.795
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
it's very hot here.

45:53.962 --> 45:56.131
I've told you already,
and you said no problem.

45:56.298 --> 45:57.341
Shall we try again?

45:57.633 --> 45:59.384
Again? Get a smarter guy.

45:59.593 --> 46:01.011
It's your fault, Sunny?

46:01.345 --> 46:03.805
Sorry, Director. Get lost!

46:06.099 --> 46:09.269
I've tried my best to help you,
don't ever come again.

46:10.437 --> 46:11.438
Just then...

46:11.605 --> 46:13.357
Do you smell BBQ chicken wing?

46:13.482 --> 46:16.235
I've sacrificed my arm
just for this movie.

46:16.443 --> 46:18.362
Unit Manager, give him an over-cooked
chicken wing rice lunch box.

46:18.529 --> 46:19.404
OK.

46:19.613 --> 46:20.948
You, don't ever let me see him again...

46:21.156 --> 46:22.241
Or I'll fire you instantly as well!

46:22.449 --> 46:23.450
Aunt Ha...

46:23.575 --> 46:26.245
Don't ask me anymore. Brother Sunny!

46:26.495 --> 46:27.955
Chicken wings rice.

46:29.498 --> 46:33.126
Let me see which is over-cooked,
the chicken wing or your arm.

46:33.544 --> 46:35.504
Not over-cooked, go away now.

46:36.338 --> 46:38.298
- Brother Sunny said I have a lunch box.
- Go away!

46:41.385 --> 46:42.594
Extras are human being as well.

46:42.845 --> 46:44.304
What? Repeat it loudly!

46:44.471 --> 46:45.472
Aren't extras human?

46:45.639 --> 46:46.849
Why must you always jump in me?

46:47.015 --> 46:49.977
- You want to know the reason?
- I want to know the reason.

46:50.143 --> 46:52.396
Because you're not entitled
to eat this lunch box!

46:54.898 --> 46:57.568
You thought you're talented
and teach others acting.

46:57.734 --> 46:59.486
You always talk about theory.

46:59.653 --> 47:02.531
You teach someone to be a triad member
and collect protection money.

47:03.740 --> 47:06.118
You're indeed insulting
the word 'acting'!

47:06.577 --> 47:08.537
Don't shout on, let's get to work.

47:09.997 --> 47:14.334
You talk about 'acting' in front of me?
Shit!

47:16.712 --> 47:18.046
Damn it!

47:19.089 --> 47:21.425
They dare to collect protection money
from those 2 ice-cream cars?

47:21.633 --> 47:23.552
I'm the protector
of those 2 ice-cream cars.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.596
They don't respect me at all.

47:25.762 --> 47:27.598
Men, get some weapons
and teach them a lesson.

47:27.764 --> 47:29.308
Sau, come with us.

47:29.558 --> 47:31.685
You can experience
how we fight for our right,

47:31.852 --> 47:33.687
and keep guard for us as well.
Men, let's go.

47:33.979 --> 47:36.648
Little Hung, where are you going?

47:36.815 --> 47:38.233
Granny, where are you doing here?

47:38.442 --> 47:39.735
You're getting better
with you tuberculosis.

47:39.943 --> 47:42.196
So mind you catch a cold,
have you taken your medicine?

47:42.279 --> 47:45.073
Yes, you're going to
fight with someone again?

47:45.157 --> 47:46.074
No.

47:46.283 --> 47:47.409
Don't go.

47:47.534 --> 47:48.660
I'm not fighting with anyone.

47:49.328 --> 47:51.997
- Don't go fighting.
- I'm not.

47:52.206 --> 47:56.418
Granny, he isn't going to fight,
he's going to act in a play.

47:56.668 --> 47:59.755
That Neighbour Theatre,
we're playing "Thunder Storm".

48:00.047 --> 48:01.465
"Thunder Storm"? It's a good play.

48:01.632 --> 48:03.759
Bruce Lee, Bark Yin,
Ng Chor Fan did it years ago.

48:03.884 --> 48:05.219
There was great response,

48:05.344 --> 48:06.762
so we're putting up one more show.

48:06.970 --> 48:08.514
We're hurrying for the rehearsal.

48:08.972 --> 48:10.724
You're acting in a play?

48:10.891 --> 48:12.184
Yes.

48:12.309 --> 48:18.440
Good, my grandson is an actor,
how smart he is!

48:19.775 --> 48:21.235
I'm very happy!

48:21.401 --> 48:23.737
OK, come on, go home now.

48:24.905 --> 48:28.534
She's put much saliva on my face.

48:29.034 --> 48:32.412
Your granny brought you up alone,
she's a real heroine.

48:32.621 --> 48:33.831
You're not.

48:37.167 --> 48:39.002
See how happy she is.

48:41.797 --> 48:45.175
Stop fighting anymore,
come and join our rehearsal.

48:52.641 --> 48:53.851
If you can defeat me,

48:54.017 --> 48:56.478
I'll swallow this plate.

48:56.687 --> 48:58.522
You aren't convinced?

48:59.398 --> 49:02.109
You should speak with stressing tone
"You aren't convinced?"

49:02.276 --> 49:04.653
This is raise my wrath from the inside.

49:04.820 --> 49:06.864
No need, as no one is watching.

49:06.989 --> 49:09.241
You suddenly want to play
"Fist of Fury".

49:09.449 --> 49:12.119
And make us to wear this costume,
this way is too much.

49:12.244 --> 49:15.038
I'm doing you a favour, right?

49:15.164 --> 49:17.624
- I only want to change the wig.
- Let's leave.

49:33.390 --> 49:35.434
That girl is pretty, your girlfriend?

49:35.642 --> 49:36.560
Sure.

49:36.768 --> 49:38.729
- Let's get serious, try again!
- Coming.

49:39.646 --> 49:41.273
If you can defeat me.

49:41.482 --> 49:44.693
I'll swallow this plate.

49:44.902 --> 49:47.488
You aren't convinced?

49:56.079 --> 49:57.623
Change the position, hurry.

50:45.838 --> 50:48.715
We're concentrated
when acting on the stage.

50:48.924 --> 50:51.176
It's dangerous if you suddenly rush up.

50:51.510 --> 50:54.179
I want to join you as you guys
were fevering up there.

50:54.429 --> 50:57.266
I chose "Fist Of Fury"
for some commercial reasons.

50:57.349 --> 50:59.852
Because there're fighting scenes,
audience will like it.

50:59.935 --> 51:01.687
The story is consisted
of blood and tears.

51:01.895 --> 51:02.980
Speaking of blood and tears,

51:03.147 --> 51:04.982
I wonder if my spine is injured.

51:05.440 --> 51:07.151
Last time I was in a bad mood
and I slapped at your face.

51:07.401 --> 51:08.944
So I came here to apologize.

51:09.111 --> 51:12.823
I'm grateful
as you watched our play tonight.

51:13.157 --> 51:14.700
- Thanks.
- You mean it?

51:16.326 --> 51:20.164
Thanks...

51:23.041 --> 51:24.459
Thanks.

51:27.713 --> 51:30.382
Thanks for your encouragement,
I'll remember it.

51:30.591 --> 51:31.675
You'll make it!

51:31.925 --> 51:34.595
Last time you taught me
pretending to be shy...

51:34.803 --> 51:37.681
and men really lift up my chin
and I said...

51:38.140 --> 51:39.349
Morning, Sir.

51:39.975 --> 51:41.810
They're all enchanted by me
and I'm making lots of money.

51:41.977 --> 51:42.769
Really?

51:42.853 --> 51:44.897
Surely,
I've made a fame in the night-club now.

51:45.022 --> 51:45.814
Congratulations.

51:45.981 --> 51:48.233
You will become an excellent club girl.

51:48.317 --> 51:49.151
Thanks.

51:49.318 --> 51:51.361
You will become
an excellent damned extra too.

51:51.570 --> 51:52.654
Thanks.

52:01.622 --> 52:05.667
Looks, it's so dark out there,
I can't see anything.

52:06.627 --> 52:09.630
No, it'll become scenic when dawn comes.

52:16.261 --> 52:17.262
I got to go.

52:18.972 --> 52:21.141
Those 3 guys are dead beat.

52:22.684 --> 52:24.812
What's wrong with you?

52:24.978 --> 52:25.854
What's wrong with me?

52:26.104 --> 52:29.399
Your lips are chapped,
you need lip balm?

52:29.650 --> 52:30.651
Thanks.

52:36.949 --> 52:39.284
I only have this, is it better?

52:41.495 --> 52:42.704
Yes, it's better.

52:45.415 --> 52:47.876
- You want some more?
- No, thanks.

52:49.670 --> 52:51.088
Forget it then.

52:52.297 --> 52:54.758
Go to hell, asshole!

52:54.842 --> 52:55.759
What's wrong with you?

52:56.051 --> 52:57.970
I hate people with chapped lips.

52:58.512 --> 53:00.889
But I don't want to have chapped lips.

53:01.306 --> 53:03.642
Why don't you
put some more lip balm then?

53:04.601 --> 53:06.019
OK, I'll put on some more!

53:07.896 --> 53:10.149
Go to hell, don't force yourself to!

53:11.900 --> 53:13.443
I do want to put some more on.

53:13.777 --> 53:14.570
I'm warning you,

53:14.736 --> 53:16.780
don't nag when I put it on your lips.

53:16.905 --> 53:20.409
I've said I want to put on some more.
Wait.

53:20.576 --> 53:21.869
You asshole!

53:22.077 --> 53:26.081
Put it on for me
like professional beautician, OK?

53:26.290 --> 53:27.499
OK.

54:51.416 --> 54:52.960
- Master Hung.
- What is it?

54:53.126 --> 54:56.880
How much is a night-club hostess
charge for overnight?

54:56.964 --> 54:59.424
Around $1000 to $1200
with a fair appearance.

54:59.633 --> 55:01.969
- What if she's pretty?
- How pretty is she then?

55:02.177 --> 55:04.096
I mean she's a real beauty.

55:04.263 --> 55:06.849
About $1 million to $10 million.

56:12.873 --> 56:14.500
Thanks, Boss.

56:36.271 --> 56:37.272
What is it?

56:37.439 --> 56:39.483
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

56:39.733 --> 56:41.610
- Where are you going?
- Going home.

56:42.569 --> 56:45.239
- And then?
- Going to work.

56:46.865 --> 56:48.158
Is it possible if you don't go to work?

56:48.325 --> 56:50.202
Are you supporting my living
if I don't go to work?

57:10.556 --> 57:11.849
What now?

57:16.854 --> 57:18.355
I'll support your living!

57:28.198 --> 57:31.702
Take care of your living first, nuts.

58:19.208 --> 58:21.293
Whether you despite me or not.

58:21.460 --> 58:23.921
I'm an actor.

58:26.048 --> 58:27.341
You're talking to me?

58:29.468 --> 58:31.929
You're calling yourself an actor,
fuck you!

58:32.846 --> 58:35.974
You owe me 3 lunch boxes,
I want to take them back now.

58:40.270 --> 58:43.690
Take them!

58:46.026 --> 58:47.903
Dare you take them!

59:19.601 --> 59:20.894
Thanks.

59:26.817 --> 59:28.569
- Wan Tin Sau!
- Stand there!

59:31.321 --> 59:32.406
Don't run!

59:33.198 --> 59:35.033
Aunt Ha, this is my lunch box.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.743
As you like, someone's looking for you.

59:36.952 --> 59:37.828
Come on.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.675
Mandy, you may go now.

59:53.093 --> 59:55.971
Go inside. Put down the lunch box.

01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:11.236
Close the door!

01:00:19.578 --> 01:00:23.290
Sister Cuckoo, director.

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:25.334
Take this seat.

01:00:25.918 --> 01:00:28.170
I want you to do an audition now.

01:00:28.462 --> 01:00:29.588
We're lovers.

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:32.132
Here is the dialogue before I die.

01:00:32.257 --> 01:00:33.175
Take a look.

01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:37.804
And my role is...

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.100
You play the role of Wan Tin Sau,
and I'll play the role of Cuckoo.

01:00:44.228 --> 01:00:45.229
OK.

01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:48.982
- Call "Action" now.
- Action.

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:53.153
Tin Sau...

01:01:01.245 --> 01:01:02.329
Cuckoo...

01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:05.374
Tin Sau...I...

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:11.004
You will be alright, Cuckoo...

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:13.715
I don't think I can make it...

01:01:14.508 --> 01:01:22.516
Cuckoo, I've encountered too much
failure in my life.

01:01:24.226 --> 01:01:26.478
I'm very tired.

01:01:27.729 --> 01:01:29.982
If I lose you too.

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:34.319
I can't hold on anymore.

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:37.823
You...take care.

01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:41.410
Don't go, Cuckoo...

01:01:42.911 --> 01:01:48.167
Cuckoo, answer me...

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:51.003
Speak to me, Cuckoo, speak something,
Cuckoo...

01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:56.758
Cuckoo...

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.678
Cut.

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:03.432
- Sister Cuckoo, clean it first.
- Get lost.

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:05.726
What's wrong? A running nose?

01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:07.436
You were really absorbed in the role.

01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:09.897
Not only absorbed in it,
very stunning too.

01:02:13.358 --> 01:02:16.445
Let me tell you,
I won't wait for Big Brother.

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:18.489
You can compromise on the schedule
with Big Brother.

01:02:18.572 --> 01:02:19.448
Who will compromise?

01:02:19.698 --> 01:02:21.658
I've had it, I want a new partner.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:23.702
You rather use this guy
than Big Brother?

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:26.622
Don't fucking, sorry.
Don't bullshit me, OK?

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:27.915
Cause I'm not doing business like this.

01:02:27.998 --> 01:02:29.333
"Oh", don't you bullshit me.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.043
We need some new blood.

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:32.461
New bloods are all around,

01:02:32.628 --> 01:02:34.046
but we're making a big budgeted movie.

01:02:34.213 --> 01:02:35.756
So you can't just introduce
a common guy like him to me.

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:36.882
He's not a common guy.

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.884
Mr. Shaw,
I've noticed him for quite some time.

01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:40.177
He's a real professional actor.

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:42.846
What professional?
We're talking about business here.

01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:44.348
Don't mix your personal feeling into it,
Sister Cuckoo.

01:02:44.932 --> 01:02:45.724
Let me tell you something man.

01:02:45.933 --> 01:02:47.976
I'm not going to work with these people
and that bitch.

01:02:48.143 --> 01:02:49.770
I'm not gonna work with this man,

01:02:49.895 --> 01:02:52.272
I don't want to see him,
I don't want to talk about it!

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:57.736
Mr. Shaw.

01:03:00.906 --> 01:03:02.950
I want you to be the leading actor
in my next movie.

01:03:03.075 --> 01:03:04.409
What do you think?

01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:07.412
Good.

01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:08.872
Here're the character,
background relationship.

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:10.123
Scenario, script...

01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:12.501
And the novel,
you may take them home for reference.

01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:13.961
I think they'll help you a lot.

01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:17.047
Here're the schedules
and the character's images.

01:03:17.256 --> 01:03:19.174
We'll get your measurement
as soon as possible.

01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:20.634
Any problem?

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:25.389
I'll surely have a lunch box everyday?

01:04:20.861 --> 01:04:23.238
Mama, I don't want
to do any business tonight.

01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:25.240
What? You fool me again.

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:26.492
I'm not fooling you.

01:04:26.575 --> 01:04:28.619
No? You're fooling me right now.

01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:31.413
Master Lung comes to see you,
he's willing to pay a lump sum.

01:04:31.538 --> 01:04:33.790
You must treat him nicely tonight.

01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:35.459
Stop fooling now.

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:37.377
I don't want to work anymore?

01:04:37.503 --> 01:04:40.297
You don't want to work?
You think you're a virgin.

01:04:41.423 --> 01:04:42.966
Why don't you just quit.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.968
I've fallen in love with someone.

01:04:45.302 --> 01:04:48.180
I don't know how to thank you
for giving me this chance.

01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:50.390
Just try your very best.

01:04:50.682 --> 01:04:54.812
I'll input all my strength
and time into this movie.

01:04:55.813 --> 01:04:59.233
I hope your girlfriend won't complain
if you can't accompany her.

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:01.777
I don't have girlfriend.

01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:04.279
You'd rather choose love than money?

01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.409
You're nuts! I don't care.

01:05:09.618 --> 01:05:11.453
You must treat him tonight,
whatever you do.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.247
We'll talk about it after that.

01:05:13.288 --> 01:05:14.790
Miss, get up and get your handbag.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:18.794
Master Lung, sorry,
I feel sick suddenly.

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:21.380
I'm afraid
I can't accompany you tonight, sorry.

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:24.299
Forget it, don't pretend like a virgin.

01:05:24.758 --> 01:05:26.802
I have lots of money.

01:05:29.054 --> 01:05:31.932
Take it, how's that?

01:05:34.434 --> 01:05:37.312
I'm really feeling sick, I can't.

01:05:38.397 --> 01:05:41.692
I don't want to hear "I can't".

01:05:42.192 --> 01:05:44.653
Is that clear? Say again.

01:05:46.488 --> 01:05:47.698
I really can't.

01:05:50.659 --> 01:05:51.869
Is it hurt?

01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:54.204
Didn't you say you're a dancing master?

01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.415
Yes, I can dance very well.

01:05:56.623 --> 01:05:58.041
Then what make you step on my feet?

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:00.460
Is it because your pace
is a bit too fast?

01:06:01.295 --> 01:06:02.713
Can you slow down your beat,
just for me?

01:06:02.838 --> 01:06:05.090
OK, just for you.

01:06:09.136 --> 01:06:13.098
Bitch! Last time I spent over
thousands of dollar on you.

01:06:13.265 --> 01:06:15.100
And now I came here and...

01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:17.060
you turn me down?

01:06:17.144 --> 01:06:19.188
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody here.

01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:20.856
I'll give you another chance.

01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:23.734
Say it again in front of everybody,
can you?

01:06:25.819 --> 01:06:26.904
I can't.

01:06:27.613 --> 01:06:30.908
Master Lung, stop beating her.
She's a little girl.

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:50.177
Master Lung, stop beating her.

01:06:50.677 --> 01:06:51.970
Can you?

01:06:59.353 --> 01:07:00.562
I can't!

01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:12.908
Let's go.

01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:18.539
Call someone for help!

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:22.709
- Morning!
- Morning!

01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:32.177
- Morning!
- Morning!

01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:35.973
- Are you Cuckoo Tu?
- Hello.

01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:38.433
It's you? I'm Lau Piu Piu.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.478
I'm your fans,
can I've your autograph, please?

01:07:41.645 --> 01:07:43.105
You're very beautiful,

01:07:43.272 --> 01:07:44.356
I love watching your movies.

01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:48.861
It's Cuckoo, ask for her autograph,
she's leaving now.

01:07:48.986 --> 01:07:52.197
In today's movie, You play the role
of a waiter at a Chinese restaurant?

01:07:52.364 --> 01:07:54.825
Or a bell boy a hotel?

01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:58.871
What's happened at your face?

01:08:00.038 --> 01:08:01.248
Don't bother.

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.709
Cuckoo,
who are you dating with recently?

01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:05.127
You guys are neighbours?

01:08:05.294 --> 01:08:06.503
You know him?

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.590
Sister Cuckoo helps me,
she wants me to be leading actor.

01:08:09.715 --> 01:08:11.842
- Go to hell.
- It's true!

01:08:12.009 --> 01:08:13.719
Sau, let's go.

01:08:13.844 --> 01:08:15.596
Mr. Shaw doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:17.680
- Really?
- Yes!

01:08:17.848 --> 01:08:20.434
I've said
you can make it someday, remember?

01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:22.644
I've said
he'll make it, he will make it.

01:08:22.769 --> 01:08:24.229
Cuckoo, ask him if you don't believe me.

01:08:24.354 --> 01:08:26.398
Sau, Mr. Shaw is flying
to the States this afternoon.

01:08:26.523 --> 01:08:27.399
Let's hurry.

01:08:27.483 --> 01:08:29.443
I think he wants to talk with you
before he departs.

01:08:29.651 --> 01:08:32.321
Do you remember,
I've said you'll make a fame.

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.531
Didn't I say this
to you that night on the beach?

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.450
I really said that to him
on the beach that night.

01:08:36.617 --> 01:08:37.743
The producer has reserved
the shooting range for you.

01:08:37.868 --> 01:08:39.411
You must practise shooting.

01:08:39.661 --> 01:08:41.412
He'll also teach you somersault,
and spring board.

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.041
And also fly with wire,
you have underwear on?

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:46.502
You must wear underwear
when flying with me.

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:47.461
I have.

01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:49.212
- OK.
- Let's go.

01:08:54.885 --> 01:08:56.386
Is your friend looking for you?

01:08:56.761 --> 01:08:58.180
No.

01:08:59.723 --> 01:09:01.140
I've something to give you back.

01:09:04.937 --> 01:09:06.145
You took it.

01:09:06.395 --> 01:09:08.732
Yes, I took it for fun.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:10.859
For fun? Is it funny?

01:09:11.193 --> 01:09:13.529
No, so I'm giving it back to you.

01:09:23.205 --> 01:09:26.082
- Anything else?
- No.

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:29.252
Goodbye.

01:09:38.178 --> 01:09:39.595
That's all.

01:09:51.567 --> 01:09:54.570
You said you'll support my living,
are you serious?

01:10:00.033 --> 01:10:01.577
Yes!

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:09.543
You mustn't cheat me.

01:10:10.335 --> 01:10:13.422
I've said yes,
I'm only waiting for you to say "yes".

01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:23.932
Why don't you go aside and chat,
just don't be late.

01:10:24.099 --> 01:10:25.100
OK.

01:10:55.464 --> 01:10:57.925
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Never mind, come there.

01:10:58.091 --> 01:10:58.884
Let me introduce.

01:10:59.051 --> 01:11:00.469
This is Peter, our Producer,

01:11:00.594 --> 01:11:02.554
And Johnny, our Associate Producer.

01:11:03.472 --> 01:11:04.890
Mr. Wan, morning.

01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:07.142
- Morning!
- Morning.

01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:08.977
- Sit down.
- Please sit down.

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:12.523
I've analysed the character.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.484
I've found there are 3 levels,
4 stages...

01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:17.861
And 5 different ways to act it.

01:11:18.028 --> 01:11:21.031
I've written it all down,
maybe we can discuss it.

01:11:21.198 --> 01:11:22.282
Very good.

01:11:22.574 --> 01:11:28.038
In order to let foreign audience
to accept me as a new actor...

01:11:28.247 --> 01:11:31.416
I'll have to
get an English name, Number.

01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:34.044
Number? Number One?

01:11:34.211 --> 01:11:35.838
Yes, Number One.

01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:38.090
Good, excellent.

01:11:38.215 --> 01:11:40.676
About the image, I also have...

01:11:40.926 --> 01:11:45.389
Tin Sau, the leading actor
was played by Big Brother.

01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:47.057
As he is too busy,

01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:49.059
we've decided to use a new actor.

01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:50.435
Just then he called us up,

01:11:50.602 --> 01:11:52.020
saying he has time for this movies.

01:11:52.146 --> 01:11:55.149
So he'll be the leading actor.

01:11:57.609 --> 01:11:59.027
Then...

01:12:01.405 --> 01:12:05.617
If so,
I can play the role of the scoundrel.

01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:08.704
For me, this is also a challenge.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.040
Sorry, we've chosen the actor
who plays the role of scoundrel.

01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:18.630
Then...I think...there is...

01:12:18.839 --> 01:12:22.050
Mr. Wan, just as Cuckoo has said...

01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:24.553
we all know you're a professional actor.

01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:25.471
Don't worry.

01:12:25.637 --> 01:12:28.515
We'll get you another role.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.850
Thanks.

01:12:32.686 --> 01:12:34.313
What role is it?

01:12:40.402 --> 01:12:41.862
You play the role of the lawyer.

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:45.574
Read the script,
and remember your lines.

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:47.534
Get prepared.

01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:49.786
How many lines are there?

01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:57.586
You've three.

01:12:57.753 --> 01:12:59.671
What are they?

01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:08.555
- The first is: "What".
- What?

01:13:08.806 --> 01:13:11.809
- The second is: "Yes".
- Yes...

01:13:12.476 --> 01:13:16.063
The third is: "Go away".

01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:24.613
I understand. I'll study them well.

01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:29.117
Mr. Wan, mind giving us back the script?

01:13:55.936 --> 01:13:57.271
Tin Sau.

01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:07.364
- Don't be like this.
- Sorry.

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.286
Mr. Wan, please take off the costume.

01:14:12.411 --> 01:14:13.954
We have clothes for you to change.

01:14:14.163 --> 01:14:15.372
This way please.

01:14:15.873 --> 01:14:16.999
Tin Sau.

01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:21.170
Sorry.

01:14:25.048 --> 01:14:27.509
Sister Cuckoo,
about the schedule of Big Brother...

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:28.844
Go out first.

01:14:29.052 --> 01:14:30.345
It's usual in movie business.

01:14:30.554 --> 01:14:31.847
Get out!

01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:52.784
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:58.665
My life is cheaper than ants.

01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:05.589
You ride a Mercedes,
while I pick my nose.

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:11.053
It's worse than dying.

01:15:12.346 --> 01:15:16.892
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

01:15:43.836 --> 01:15:46.964
Kid, still want to play a character?

01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:50.133
- How may lines?
- Definitely more than 3.

01:15:50.384 --> 01:15:52.427
- What kind of role is it?
- A good guy.

01:15:53.137 --> 01:15:54.054
What movies is it?

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:56.140
Don't ask so much, are you interested?

01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:57.641
- Yes.
- Come here.

01:16:08.193 --> 01:16:09.528
What is the situation?

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.029
I'm working on it.

01:16:11.238 --> 01:16:12.531
Frankly.

01:16:12.823 --> 01:16:14.658
I'm not a real Unit Manager.

01:16:14.867 --> 01:16:17.953
I'm Police Officer, he's my supervisor.

01:16:18.162 --> 01:16:20.372
We're from Criminal Intelligency Bureau.

01:16:20.581 --> 01:16:21.707
Or short-formed as C.I.B.

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:23.917
To make it simple, I'm an undercover.

01:16:24.459 --> 01:16:25.252
You're an undercover?

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.255
You don't believe that? I'm much better
than those so-called actors.

01:16:28.422 --> 01:16:30.674
I'm more skillful.

01:16:30.883 --> 01:16:32.926
Because I'm acting every day
when I work here.

01:16:33.177 --> 01:16:36.054
Though I have no script,
I never make any NG.

01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:38.474
Because any NG
will cause the death of me.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.060
So I should be the Best Actor in Oscar.

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:43.896
Mighty!

01:16:45.314 --> 01:16:48.734
Today I should be going on
a mission with my informant.

01:16:49.318 --> 01:16:51.987
But he suffers from epilepsy suddenly,
be can't go with me.

01:16:53.405 --> 01:16:54.490
I want you to substitute him,

01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:56.366
We'll pay you $800
for being our informant.

01:16:57.242 --> 01:17:00.537
Money is not important,
I only want to practise my acting.

01:17:00.662 --> 01:17:01.872
You surely can.

01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:12.633
Big Brother, policemen are outside,
you'd better run away.

01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:15.260
Buddy, just left, I'll stay behind.

01:17:22.643 --> 01:17:23.852
You betray me?

01:17:24.019 --> 01:17:26.772
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:32.027
What make me pull the trigger?

01:17:32.194 --> 01:17:34.238
I'll go to the robber's place
in an hour.

01:17:34.363 --> 01:17:37.491
And I want to install bugs
to collect their criminal evidence.

01:17:37.616 --> 01:17:39.868
But every time I got there,
they'll search me thoroughly.

01:17:40.077 --> 01:17:43.997
So, I want you to deliver a lunch box
to me, with the bugs inside.

01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:44.998
Then you go away.

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.834
- You mean I am...
- The delivery boy.

01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:47.960
I have no...

01:17:48.085 --> 01:17:50.754
Your role is important,
grasp the chance.

01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:53.257
What about the character,
the relation and background?

01:17:53.423 --> 01:17:55.467
The character,
the relation and background...

01:17:55.676 --> 01:17:58.554
are all on the menu of the coffee shops.

01:17:58.679 --> 01:17:59.972
Study them now.

01:18:00.097 --> 01:18:03.600
But you must act accordingly
when you are on the scene.

01:18:03.767 --> 01:18:04.768
Why choose me?

01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:06.979
We need a professional actor.

01:18:07.104 --> 01:18:08.438
I think that person is you.

01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:10.524
You're the leading actor this time.

01:18:23.954 --> 01:18:25.372
What is there in a Mixed Grill?

01:18:25.539 --> 01:18:27.166
Pork chop, beef steak, chicken wing,
sausage, egg.

01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:28.417
And Set Lunch A?

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:29.877
Sunny-side-up-egg, minced beef rice,
chicken corn soup.

01:18:30.085 --> 01:18:31.170
Coffee or tea.

01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:32.087
And Set Lunch B?

01:18:32.296 --> 01:18:34.047
Vegetable and pork rice, Chef'ss soup,
tea or coffee.

01:18:34.256 --> 01:18:36.216
- The charge for a cold drink is...
- $2.

01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:37.593
What is served all day round?

01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:38.927
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger.

01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:40.095
How much?

01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:44.766
- $20.
- Study it better, man.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.059
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger...

01:18:46.143 --> 01:18:47.478
What is there for in a Mixed Grill?

01:18:47.603 --> 01:18:49.688
You're a delivery boy now.

01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:51.190
Remember to play the role well.

01:18:51.356 --> 01:18:53.066
I'll go into their place soon.

01:18:53.192 --> 01:18:55.027
I'll order the steamed rice with tomato
and egg at once.

01:18:55.277 --> 01:18:57.863
You must deliver it to me
in exactly 10 minutes.

01:18:59.114 --> 01:19:00.199
Let's start.

01:19:00.407 --> 01:19:02.367
- It's formal?
- Yes.

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:04.620
- No more rehearsal?
- No.

01:19:05.829 --> 01:19:08.999
- Could you say "Action" first
- Action.

01:19:31.313 --> 01:19:32.523
- Ben.
- Mao!

01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:34.274
Why didn't you ask me
to go to Macau with you?

01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:35.359
I did page you for that.

01:19:35.567 --> 01:19:36.777
When did you page me?

01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:37.694
I think you didn't turn the pager on.

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.405
How come? I turn it on 24 hours.

01:19:41.198 --> 01:19:43.242
No wonder you're so poor.

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:44.785
Hey, check my dick...

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:48.121
This bastard takes advantages of
others all the time.

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:49.331
Feel free to check it.

01:19:50.415 --> 01:19:52.459
Chu, greet Brother Mao.

01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:55.128
Just call me Mao, Brother Chu.

01:19:56.088 --> 01:19:58.757
Leather jacket again? Is it a gathering
for leather jacket wears?

01:20:00.092 --> 01:20:01.176
We've the same design too.

01:20:01.552 --> 01:20:04.221
I'm here to deliver food...

01:20:04.429 --> 01:20:06.056
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5, please.

01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:07.474
- Kee.
- Yes.

01:20:07.683 --> 01:20:09.309
His jacket is worn out naturally.

01:20:09.434 --> 01:20:10.561
Look at the texture.

01:20:10.769 --> 01:20:14.064
His jacket must be worn
for at least 20 years.

01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:17.234
- Your grandpa left it to you?
- I bought it recently.

01:20:20.571 --> 01:20:21.780
Bastard.

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:27.744
I want one too.

01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:41.675
Order some food now.

01:20:41.884 --> 01:20:43.385
Time for meal.

01:20:44.052 --> 01:20:45.804
- Come over, help me.
- Time to eat.

01:20:45.929 --> 01:20:47.347
Mao, come here.

01:20:54.438 --> 01:20:55.439
Let's chat while eating.

01:20:55.647 --> 01:20:58.108
OK, good dishes!

01:20:58.275 --> 01:21:00.944
Good dishes? We can eat something
much better after the project.

01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:02.404
Project?

01:21:02.529 --> 01:21:04.907
Wait...no tomato and egg?

01:21:05.115 --> 01:21:07.784
I want tomato and egg,
I want rice with tomato and egg.

01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:10.412
No need, want tomato and egg?
Here it comes.

01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:11.705
How come?

01:21:12.539 --> 01:21:15.709
It's really tomato and egg, bingo.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.129
Scrambled egg?

01:21:19.254 --> 01:21:21.507
No, I want sunny-side-up.

01:21:21.715 --> 01:21:23.759
Let me order sunny-side-up with tomato.

01:21:24.051 --> 01:21:26.094
Sunny-side-up? Chu,
make one for him now.

01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:30.599
Why making trouble?
Delivery service is convenient.

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:32.684
You're asking for trouble indeed.

01:21:33.894 --> 01:21:34.978
Is it Kuen Fat?

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:42.110
How come the delivery is so fast?

01:21:42.236 --> 01:21:43.654
Yeah, I haven't ordered yet.

01:21:48.492 --> 01:21:49.827
Why is it taking so long?

01:21:49.993 --> 01:21:51.954
I still have something else to deliver,
men.

01:21:52.663 --> 01:21:53.455
Have you ordered anything?

01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:56.583
I ordered it, mutton stew.

01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.252
How come it is here so quick?

01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.336
Is it well done?

01:21:59.586 --> 01:22:02.256
Ask the cook for that, $39.8 please!

01:22:02.756 --> 01:22:04.174
- I'll pay.
- No need.

01:22:04.383 --> 01:22:05.592
Why not? Let me pay.

01:22:05.801 --> 01:22:07.219
- I've said I'll pay.
- It's alright.

01:22:07.386 --> 01:22:08.595
I will pay.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.181
You pay next time, it's my bill.

01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:15.018
No...don't do that.

01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:16.895
Let me treat you this time!

01:22:17.187 --> 01:22:20.357
Just $40
and you two push around and around.

01:22:20.524 --> 01:22:21.984
Why don't you pay by credit card,
asshole!

01:22:22.192 --> 01:22:23.485
What did you say, bastard?

01:22:23.610 --> 01:22:26.780
Don't move, either you pay now
or I'll take it back.

01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:28.073
Or I'll pay for you.

01:22:31.451 --> 01:22:32.744
What are you doing?

01:22:33.537 --> 01:22:35.914
I've said many times,
why don't you walk closer?

01:22:36.123 --> 01:22:37.666
Walk closer and shoot him from the top.

01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:39.918
Then blood won't splash on the wall.

01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:43.172
You never listen to me.
Can't you be a professional?

01:22:52.431 --> 01:22:55.100
But delivery boys
are very rude these days.

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:56.643
They are always like this.

01:22:57.311 --> 01:22:58.437
Let's eat.

01:23:00.022 --> 01:23:00.814
Who is it?

01:23:00.981 --> 01:23:04.485
I'm here to deliver some food.

01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:09.323
Go and take a look, Chu...

01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:20.792
How are you,
I'm here to delivery some food.

01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:22.294
OK.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.881
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5 please.

01:23:26.089 --> 01:23:26.882
You ordered that?

01:23:27.049 --> 01:23:29.635
No, I haven't.

01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:33.055
You haven't ordered?

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.515
Have you come to the wrong place?

01:23:38.602 --> 01:23:40.354
- No.7.
- No.7?

01:23:42.898 --> 01:23:44.942
It's No.1, send it to No.1.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.402
Do you still want it?

01:23:47.528 --> 01:23:50.614
Are you out of your mind,
I didn't order it.

01:23:50.739 --> 01:23:51.949
Rice with tomato and egg?

01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:01.458
What do you mean? Are you nuts, Go away.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.838
You want rice with tomato and egg,
I'll take it.

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:07.673
No, someone else ordered it.

01:24:07.798 --> 01:24:11.093
I said I want it, come here.

01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:15.514
Come here!

01:24:15.722 --> 01:24:17.474
Can you give it to us first?

01:24:24.314 --> 01:24:27.651
What a coincidence! No.1 also
ordered rice with tomato and egg.

01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:28.944
Is tomato and egg good?

01:24:29.153 --> 01:24:31.905
The egg and tomato are both nutritious.

01:24:32.114 --> 01:24:32.906
What do you mean nutritious?

01:24:33.073 --> 01:24:34.992
It contains a lot of Vitamin C.

01:24:35.159 --> 01:24:36.368
Other fruits contain that too.

01:24:36.493 --> 01:24:38.245
Other fruits don't contain
as much as tomato.

01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:39.746
You don't want the money?

01:24:41.373 --> 01:24:42.583
$25.5 please.

01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:43.709
How come it's so expensive?

01:24:43.917 --> 01:24:45.544
- It's one and a half order.
- How much for one order?

01:24:45.752 --> 01:24:46.879
$36.8.

01:24:46.962 --> 01:24:48.172
How come it is more expensive?

01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:49.673
It's 12.2 for one order.

01:24:49.882 --> 01:24:50.674
And how much for one and a half order?

01:24:50.924 --> 01:24:51.800
$36.8.

01:24:51.967 --> 01:24:53.051
You just said $25.5.

01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:54.887
It's $25.5.

01:24:55.053 --> 01:24:56.263
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

01:24:56.305 --> 01:24:57.097
What?

01:24:57.264 --> 01:24:58.765
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

01:24:58.932 --> 01:24:59.933
Ham and egg.

01:25:00.184 --> 01:25:01.268
How much is it?

01:25:01.435 --> 01:25:02.311
$12.2.

01:25:02.519 --> 01:25:03.520
How much if I want one and a half order?

01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:04.646
$25.5.

01:25:04.855 --> 01:25:06.190
How come there is
one and a half order for breakfast?

01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:08.442
You can order two extra sausages.

01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:10.527
How much if I want 3 extra sausages?

01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:11.570
Don't do that.

01:25:11.778 --> 01:25:13.113
How much is it?

01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:15.032
I'm only a delivery boy.

01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:16.533
I ask you how much it is.

01:25:18.035 --> 01:25:19.453
I don't know.

01:25:19.578 --> 01:25:20.704
How much?

01:25:20.829 --> 01:25:22.789
I'm really a delivery boy!

01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:25.250
You are not!

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:29.922
Kid, tell us frankly,
are you a delivery boy?

01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:32.508
- I've just started work today!
- Just started work today?

01:25:32.674 --> 01:25:34.718
I didn't know being delivery boy
must answer so many questions.

01:25:34.885 --> 01:25:36.011
Don't fucking fool me?

01:25:36.303 --> 01:25:38.889
What are you doing? Are you a cop?

01:25:39.097 --> 01:25:40.224
Yes, what's wrong?

01:25:40.307 --> 01:25:41.725
I'm really a delivery boy.

01:25:44.269 --> 01:25:47.564
Nothing...he's an idiot.

01:25:47.815 --> 01:25:50.359
Search him if you don't believe.
Search him!

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:57.449
Kid, I let you go now,
be smart in future!

01:26:03.413 --> 01:26:04.748
What is it?

01:26:09.419 --> 01:26:11.380
Why did you do this?

01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:19.596
What do you want?

01:26:27.688 --> 01:26:28.897
What is it?

01:26:32.609 --> 01:26:34.570
Want to harm me?

01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:17.362
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

01:27:30.751 --> 01:27:32.044
Cut.

01:27:34.838 --> 01:27:35.756
How's that?

01:27:36.006 --> 01:27:37.966
I'm fine, I'm still alive.

01:27:38.133 --> 01:27:40.594
I mean my performance.

01:27:40.886 --> 01:27:44.598
Very well, as this is your first time
being the leading actor.

01:27:45.057 --> 01:27:46.350
Good take.

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.186
Thanks.

01:27:49.686 --> 01:27:50.979
I'll call to police.

01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:57.402
- Police!
- Freeze!

01:27:57.486 --> 01:27:58.695
He's on my side...

01:27:59.404 --> 01:28:00.614
Call the ambulance!

01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:11.375
Piu Piu.

01:28:13.085 --> 01:28:15.462
What's going on? It's dark already,
and you didn't give me a call?

01:28:15.546 --> 01:28:17.297
- Shall I cook dinner for you?
- Just then I...

01:28:17.381 --> 01:28:19.508
What's happen to you?
Didn't you play as the leading actor?

01:28:19.716 --> 01:28:21.969
I don't care whether
you're a leading actor or an extra.

01:28:22.136 --> 01:28:23.554
You must support my living forever.

01:28:23.804 --> 01:28:25.931
Come on, try it
and see if it suits or not.

01:28:26.473 --> 01:28:29.560
Red? Is it lipstick?
You're dating someone else?

01:28:30.018 --> 01:28:31.353
I forgive you but...

01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:34.231
I won't cook for you
if you dare next time, go!

01:28:36.358 --> 01:28:39.444
What are you looking at?
Fight back, nuts!

01:28:43.073 --> 01:28:45.742
Piu Piu, I love you.

01:29:05.345 --> 01:29:06.430
Wait

01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:09.349
You two mustn't get married!

01:29:09.558 --> 01:29:10.559
Why?

01:29:10.684 --> 01:29:13.187
Because you guys are brother and sister.

01:29:14.313 --> 01:29:17.733
Sister, I'm sorry.

01:29:18.025 --> 01:29:20.944
It's not your business,
I'm willing myself.

01:29:21.153 --> 01:29:23.906
Your mood is wrong for this situation.

01:29:24.114 --> 01:29:25.115
I've told you before.

01:29:25.324 --> 01:29:28.827
Mood begins from your heart,
then goes to the outside of your body...

01:29:28.994 --> 01:29:29.786
and returns to the heart, got it?

01:29:29.953 --> 01:29:32.623
- Yes, got it.
- Don't be nervous.

01:29:32.915 --> 01:29:34.208
I'm not nervous.

01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:38.545
Sau, I think
the role of Master suits you more.

01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:40.214
Why don't you play it?

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:43.675
Forget it, I'm not talented in acting.

01:29:43.926 --> 01:29:45.761
I'd better be audience.

01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:47.554
Not at all.

01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:48.555
You're good.
