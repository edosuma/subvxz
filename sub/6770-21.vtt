WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:04.421
Mom, just because I'm in tonight

00:04.504 --> 00:07.882
does not mean
I'm feeling sorry for myself.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.218
Before I met your father,
I went to where the boys were.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.428
I didn't stay home.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.263
Well, Mom,
if I didn't stay home,

00:13.346 --> 00:14.431
I wouldn't be able to take

00:14.514 --> 00:16.433
your "do you have
a boyfriend yet?" calls.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.059
I just want you to be happy.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.437
-How's David?
-"How's David?"

00:20.520 --> 00:22.439
I-I don't think I've ever heard
you connect those two ideas.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.233
Well, I think he's been
a good friend to you.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.318
Yeah, he is, and he's actually
seeing someone.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.611
You know Camille from the store?

00:28.695 --> 00:32.323
She that girl with
the-the too short hair?

00:32.406 --> 00:33.742
(chuckles)
Yeah, Mom.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.618
Where's Kelly?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.454
She's out, with Matt.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.830
You know what?

00:38.913 --> 00:40.331
This is a great pep talk.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.416
(Kelly giggling, door opens)

00:41.499 --> 00:42.917
Oh, uh...

00:43.001 --> 00:45.795
Kelly and Matt are home,
and I'm not really dressed.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.464
Well, if you were out on a date,
you would be.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.840
Mom, shush.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.967
(Kelly and Matt giggling)

00:52.552 --> 00:54.304
-Is that your hand?
-Do you want me to move it?

00:54.387 --> 00:55.805
No. I like it.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.683
(Kelly squeals, giggles)

00:58.767 --> 01:00.268
What's happening?

01:00.351 --> 01:01.770
(Kelly laughs, door closes)

01:01.853 --> 01:02.812
(sighs)

01:02.896 --> 01:04.022
Nothing. Nothing.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.315
I'm going to bed.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.817
All right, well, get yourself
a nice, long nightgown, okay?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.235
I love you.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.029
Yeah, I'll get the jammies
with the feet.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.614
Love you, too. Bye.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.409
(Kelly and Matt laughing)

01:20.413 --> 01:22.415
(Kelly laughing)

01:28.254 --> 01:30.256
(Kelly continues laughing)

01:33.176 --> 01:34.719
(sighs)

01:34.803 --> 01:36.763
Ew.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.516
MAN (over radio):
Well...

01:39.599 --> 01:41.893
my fantasy
is that she doesn't talk.

01:41.976 --> 01:44.020
DAVID:
When? During sex?

01:44.103 --> 01:45.230
MAN:
<i>No. I mean, ever.</i>

01:45.313 --> 01:46.314
<i>Chicks can drive you nuts</i>

01:46.397 --> 01:48.358
with that yap-yap-yap--
especially the smart ones.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.361
You, pal, are lame.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.112
(tapping buttons)

01:53.196 --> 01:54.572
Okay, folks.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.700
Tonight's topic
is sexual fantasies.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.911
You present them,
I rank them with my...

01:59.994 --> 02:01.913
steam-o-meter.

02:01.996 --> 02:05.250
And, uh, that last call
gets negative two.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.335
(tapping buttons)

02:07.418 --> 02:08.877
You're on the air
with David Silver.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.088
CAMILLE:
Hi.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.382
<i>Are you still looking</i>
<i>for a fantasy?</i>

02:12.465 --> 02:13.883
'Cause I've got one
that may just

02:13.967 --> 02:16.052
-rock your world.
-Camille?

02:16.135 --> 02:17.887
Well, I'm very interested
in hearing it.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.641
My boyfriend takes me
somewhere nice,

02:21.724 --> 02:23.017
but crowded.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.229
And then we find a secret spot
and make love.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.398
DAVID:
Sex in a public place.

02:28.481 --> 02:32.402
You envisioning any...
specific locations?

02:32.485 --> 02:33.570
Oh, God, no.

02:33.653 --> 02:37.240
CAMILLE: Mmm, maybe the
planetarium at Griffith Park.

02:37.323 --> 02:40.076
Or there is a glass elevator
at the Beverly Center.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.954
Well, I think my steam-o-meter
just exploded.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.581
And you're lucky, caller.

02:44.664 --> 02:48.626
I'm fairly confident
this fantasy is doable.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.086
CAMILLE:
Mmm.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.421
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.463
Pretty sure.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.882
(chuckling)

02:56.467 --> 02:57.927
(sighs)

02:58.011 --> 03:00.054
(thudding,
Kelly squeals and laughs)

03:01.723 --> 03:02.932
(sighs)

03:03.016 --> 03:04.684
Oh, why me?

You know, we serve that here.
It's really good.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.768
Well, we were going to hire Nat,

05:10.852 --> 05:13.062
but they want to change
the whole campaign.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.190
So I was thinking, like,
a '60s-style cocktail party.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.567
STEVE:
Well, that sounds more like...

05:17.650 --> 05:18.818
advertising than PR.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.529
Yeah, well, Mr. Borst
has his own ideas.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.364
Which is why I need
to talk to Maddy.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.450
How would you like to have

05:25.533 --> 05:28.619
your picture taken
with some of L.A.'s cutest kids?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.207
She said no.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.170
How about $500
for one hour of work?

05:40.673 --> 05:42.467
She said,
"When hell freezes over."

05:42.550 --> 05:43.718
(gasps)

05:43.801 --> 05:44.594
We're going to have to talk

05:44.677 --> 05:46.512
to our daughter
about all this swearing.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.556
-Maddy, shame on you.
-KELLY: Come on, you guys.

05:48.639 --> 05:49.932
There will be
a top photographer there.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.434
You'll get something cute
for your baby book.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.769
Sounds great to me.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.771
My mom was on <i> The Hartley House,</i>

05:54.854 --> 05:56.731
and I grew up
around all these child actors.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.567
Print ads lead to commercials,
which lead to sitcoms,

05:59.650 --> 06:03.237
which lead to sex, drugs
and rock star boyfriends.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.406
Before you know it, we'll be
raiding her bank account,

06:05.490 --> 06:08.826
and then she'll be dissing us on
<i>E! True Hollywood Stories.</i> No.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.454
Or we could put the money
into Maddy's college fund.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.622
I'll go with her.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.790
You have copyediting.

06:13.873 --> 06:14.791
That's why God made pencils.

06:14.874 --> 06:15.833
So, just tell me where to go.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.502
-And when.
-12:00.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.586
Covato Studios.

06:18.669 --> 06:21.130
STEVE:
Covato Studios?

06:21.214 --> 06:24.592
Does the name Corey Feldman
mean anything to anybody?

06:25.885 --> 06:27.470
(chuckling)

06:31.766 --> 06:32.975
Hey. You look busy.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.811
Oh, yeah.
"Crazed" is more like it.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.312
What are you doing here?

06:36.395 --> 06:38.022
-Well...
-(motorcycle engine revving)

06:38.106 --> 06:39.315
(tires squealing)

06:43.569 --> 06:45.530
(tires squeal)

06:46.906 --> 06:49.492
MATT (grunts):
Wow.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.035
Man.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.830
Corners well, but the
front end's a little squishy.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.873
Yeah, I'll have my guy
dial that in.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.500
What just happened?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.502
Dylan's doing a little riding
in the high desert

06:59.585 --> 07:00.503
-this weekend.
-You know what?

07:00.586 --> 07:02.171
Talk to Mike.
He'll hook you up with one.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.007
And, uh, Kel, good luck
with the "crazed" thing.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.554
(engine revving)

07:14.433 --> 07:16.018
MATT:
Oh, wow.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.646
CR 125--
that is a beautiful machine.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.399
What happened
to my sensitive man who cooks?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.317
Oh, my grandpa--

07:23.401 --> 07:25.069
he owned a farm
in upstate New York.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.654
We used to dirt-bike there
all the time.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.738
So, since my caseload's light,

07:27.822 --> 07:29.448
I thought I'd tag along
with Dylan.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.200
You and Dylan-- road-tripping.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.660
What? You wanted us
to be friends.

07:32.743 --> 07:36.539
Yeah, in-in a... "let's go
get a beer" kind of way.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.875
What are you guys going
to talk about all weekend?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.710
Uh, nothing.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.005
Wait. You think we're going
to talk about you? Is that it?

07:44.088 --> 07:46.174
No.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.717
Have a nice trip.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.552
If you get hurt, I'll kill you.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.637
(Matt groans)

07:53.973 --> 07:55.433
Drive safe.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.145
Bye.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.568
(chuckles)

08:17.496 --> 08:19.457
Great look.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.583
Oh, you think so?

08:20.666 --> 08:21.751
Yeah.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.252
Sexy.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.421
-Very revealing.
-Mmm.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.423
Kind of like you
on the radio last night?

08:27.506 --> 08:29.050
(laughing):
Oh, did you hear that?

08:29.133 --> 08:30.384
Uh-huh.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.385
I don't know what came over me.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.431
(phone ringing)

08:37.015 --> 08:38.808
Now Wear This.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.770
DAVID:
<i>Hey. You want to take a trip to</i>

08:40.852 --> 08:41.938
the Santa Monica Pier?

08:42.020 --> 08:43.272
Clothing is optional.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.441
Are you serious?

08:45.524 --> 08:47.735
-When?
-Right now.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.820
David, I'm working.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.113
Well, I was working last night.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.448
It didn't seem
to bother you then.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.283
All right, meet me at closing.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.411
You drive, and I'll take care
of everything else.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.579
See you then.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.665
Okay. Bye.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.459
Hey, Donna.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.004
Do you mind if I leave
a couple minutes early tonight?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.465
Well, you know what you need
to get done, so...

09:09.548 --> 09:11.550
Okay. I'll get started.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.557
(sighs)

09:21.143 --> 09:24.105
There were supposed to be stars
with those stripes.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.440
Missed the memo.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.192
KELLY (chuckles nervously):
Uh, yeah, yeah.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.486
We'll, uh, get the
art department right on that.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.738
Taylor, I want 50 stars
for our 50 states.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.158
Our customers value patriotism
as much as they do my sausage.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.326
-Remember that.
-Got it.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.327
BORST:
Oh!

09:38.411 --> 09:41.163
The Weenie Babies!

09:41.247 --> 09:43.374
Keep him away from me.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.750
Yeah.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.130
That doesn't look like
a Borst sausage.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.883
Borst sausages have
that Borst sausage smile.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.385
Four more nationals

09:54.468 --> 09:56.512
and Mary here
is halfway to Yale.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.849
I just dumped Joshua's money
into that mutual fund.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.350
Yeah?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.352
How many commercials
has yours booked this year?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.313
Oh, um, we're just here
as a favor to a friend.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.189
BORST:
Oh.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.649
There's a corn-fed kid.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.234
Sign her up.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.361
You'll do.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.487
Oh.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.698
Rosy cheeks, twinkle eyes.

10:15.781 --> 10:19.285
That whole package has "Borst"
written all over it!

10:19.368 --> 10:21.287
Position one.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.876
Oh! And I have some notes

10:26.959 --> 10:29.962
on that ad copy, Taylor.
The big note is, "It stinks."

10:32.048 --> 10:34.383
(babies cooing)

10:34.467 --> 10:36.594
Um, is that bad?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.221
Are you kidding?

10:39.305 --> 10:40.389
It's great.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
She's lead bun.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.065
My daughter-- lead bun.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.407
(rock music playing)

10:58.491 --> 11:01.160
Uh, vodka martini straight up.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.373
(sighs)

11:15.674 --> 11:16.926
Here you go.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.054
Uh, martini equals no bubbles.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.597
(chuckles)

11:21.680 --> 11:23.766
I'm Noah, from your Wednesday
night meeting.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.311
You're in A.A.
and you work here.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.480
That's rich.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.774
Yep, certainly is, huh?

11:31.857 --> 11:33.442
So what's your name?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.319
-(sighs): Ellen.
-Ellen.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.405
You want to talk about it?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.448
I don't know;
you got a couple of hours?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.491
Yeah.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.284
As a matter of fact, I do.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.245
Right back.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.679
(clears throat)

12:01.762 --> 12:02.972
Well, I don't know about you,

12:03.055 --> 12:04.807
but I am fired up
and ready to go.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.643
Oh, I can't.

12:07.726 --> 12:11.105
This came in early
from the manufacturer.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.524
So, what, you have to
stock it tonight?

12:13.607 --> 12:17.111
No, but Donna's
in a terrible mood.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.237
So...
(chuckles)

12:18.320 --> 12:21.407
suddenly, there's a need
to inventory our fall line.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.454
Are you telling me
we have to do this another time?

12:28.539 --> 12:30.541
Hmm?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.880
Hmm?

12:38.757 --> 12:39.758
(chuckles)

12:49.101 --> 12:51.520
Careful.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.524
You know,
we don't actually have to

12:55.608 --> 12:57.610
go to Santa Monica
to be in public.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.790
(giggles)

13:22.635 --> 13:26.347
You were an absolute
lifesaver tonight.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.433
Ah... anytime.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.228
(sighs)

13:32.311 --> 13:34.522
There's nothing worse-- coming
home to an empty apartment.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.899
Yep. Especially
if you want a drink.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.277
Times like this,

13:40.361 --> 13:42.905
I usually just drive
to the beach.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.908
The pounding of the waves
just clears everything out.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.118
That's funny.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.913
I lived on a boat
for a long time.

13:50.996 --> 13:55.084
And, um, only thing that
kept me sane were those waves.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.252
Let's keep going.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.504
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.673
Let's go right to Malibu and
hang out till the sun comes up.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.632
What do you think?

14:01.715 --> 14:03.425
Drive.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.552
(Ellen laughs)

14:04.635 --> 14:05.761
My kind of girl.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.054
(engine starts)

14:17.523 --> 14:18.440
Camille?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.234
Donna, just a second!

14:20.317 --> 14:21.819
Camille, I think
I left my cell phone.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.738
Hey, Donna.

14:24.822 --> 14:25.906
How's it going?

14:26.865 --> 14:28.826
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

14:28.909 --> 14:30.995
(Donna groans)

14:39.878 --> 14:43.465
Janet, why were these
under the sofa cushions?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.426
Oh, my copyediting.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.677
I was looking
for that everywhere.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.429
Janet, that was due yesterday.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.307
Maddy's bun needed alterations.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.142
I was with the, uh, costumer.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.311
Um, her name's Catherine,
and she's from New York.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.771
Well, unless Catherine can get
us Polaroids of Pamela Lee's

14:57.855 --> 14:59.982
next wardrobe fitting,
I want you in a quiet corner

15:00.065 --> 15:01.859
with a red pen, flying.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.444
Don't you think
our daughter's career

15:03.527 --> 15:04.987
is a little more important
right now?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.323
Career? She's five months old!

15:07.406 --> 15:08.991
-(bell dings)
-Ooh.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.659
(Maddy cooing)

15:10.743 --> 15:14.788
I hope that these are all right,
because Gary, the props guy--

15:14.872 --> 15:17.458
he likes them
a little under-baked.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.793
You're out of control.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.670
I am not.

15:25.924 --> 15:27.676
I mean, Donna couldn't
possibly understand

15:27.760 --> 15:30.012
how I felt after Beth died.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.015
Or why I let my parents
make all the decisions for me.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.351
Well, Donna's
naturally strong, right?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.810
Yeah.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.480
It's hard for people like that
to understand weakness.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.565
Especially in people they love.

15:45.653 --> 15:49.239
Well, been a long time
since I fed seagulls.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.033
You're such a natural at it,
why don't you keep this?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.034
A souvenir.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.369
No, thanks.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.370
You sure?

15:54.453 --> 15:55.871
(chuckles)

15:55.954 --> 15:57.539
Okay.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.042
It's her loss.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.252
Your ex's, I mean.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.840
Thanks.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.387
I should, uh, probably go.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.554
Thanks for listening.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.224
Did your fair share, too.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.018
I guess...

16:18.102 --> 16:21.063
sometimes it's easier to open up
to a total stranger.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.524
Yeah.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.734
I guess that's what we are, huh?

16:25.818 --> 16:26.944
Strangers.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.629
Stay with me.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.799
(sighs):
Okay.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.099
I don't know if you ate already,
but I brought you a salad.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.100
Donna?

16:58.183 --> 16:59.435
Not hungry.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.446
Boy, this is really unnecessary.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.906
I left a message at your home

17:13.991 --> 17:16.993
that you didn't
need to be in till 1:00.

17:17.077 --> 17:20.539
Yeah, well,
I thought we should talk.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.623
Hi, Donna.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.171
Hey.

17:27.253 --> 17:30.466
I think I need some coffee.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.467
Here.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.470
Disinfects most staph
and strep infections.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.473
But only on nonporous surfaces.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.437
Yeah, that's what
she needs-- coffee.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.438
(Camille scoffs)

17:44.521 --> 17:46.315
She walked in on us having sex.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.443
Yeah, I know; I was there.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.986
Well, it's weird, all right?

17:51.069 --> 17:51.904
And she's uncomfortable.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.239
You know, I admit,
it was a little tacky,

17:54.323 --> 17:55.491
but that's not the problem.

17:55.574 --> 17:59.161
Donna's not a prude or a bitch,
but she's acting like both.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.454
You know why?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.122
Because she wants you back.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.504
That's ridiculous.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.672
David, there's
no other explanation.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.509
Who was I on the floor with
last night? That was you, right?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.385
Yeah, but this is not about me.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.512
Yeah, but I didn't
do anything wrong.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.847
You're completely blind.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.057
No, I'm not blind.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.642
Yeah, and the more blind
that you are,

18:21.725 --> 18:24.228
or you choose to be,
the more worried I get.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.031
Fired?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.491
KELLY:
No, not fired.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.492
Retooled.

18:38.575 --> 18:39.326
BORST:
Taylor! I want

18:39.409 --> 18:41.495
everything Weenie Babies
out of here!

18:41.578 --> 18:43.997
It was all just a bad,
talentless dream.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.542
No.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.919
This was Maddy's chance
to shine.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.045
We did everything right.

18:50.128 --> 18:53.257
Sh-She smiled when they asked,
we never complained.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.884
Whatever happened
to meritocracy?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.177
This is not your fault.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.596
Borst is temperamental
and completely erratic.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.558
The cookies were
a big hit, though.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.519
I want my Tupperware back.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.107
(cell phone ringing)

19:10.190 --> 19:11.358
Hello.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.777
DONNA: Hi, it's Donna.
We have to talk.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.406
Every time I work
behind the cash register,

19:17.489 --> 19:19.616
I get this creepy feeling
that turns into the icky feeling

19:19.700 --> 19:21.410
that turns into
this mad feeling.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.037
Mm, that probably makes
ringing up sales difficult.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.747
Please, come back
to the store, please.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.126
The way things are going today,
I would love that.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.587
Am I crazy for letting this
bother me so much?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.422
Yes. And, uh,

19:33.505 --> 19:35.132
possessive of something
that doesn't belong to you.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.425
And a little predatory, too.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.427
How do you really feel?

19:40.470 --> 19:42.556
So, they had sex? Ew.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.601
But so what?

19:45.684 --> 19:46.768
David isn't yours.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.478
I mean, he could be,
if you would ever

19:48.562 --> 19:50.439
get around to telling him
how you really feel.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.773
And come between
him and Camille?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.275
Now, that would be predatory.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.735
Fine.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.069
But as long as you're gonna keep

19:56.153 --> 19:57.195
some of your feelings
from David,

19:57.279 --> 19:59.281
I think you have to keep
all of your feelings from David.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.326
Even the ones
that make you feel crazy.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.953
Or else you're just
being unfair.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.457
Do you want to hear
something really annoying?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.918
Camille has flawless skin.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.085
Everywhere.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.296
I did not need to hear that.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.132
Well, I didn't need to see that.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.300
(Noah and Ellen laugh)

20:18.383 --> 20:20.177
Come on. Hey.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.471
Kelly, Donna, this is Ellen.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.473
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.516
Uh, could you guys do me a favor
and keep Ellen company?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.310
I'm gonna go next door
and, uh, get a blanket.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.771
Sure.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.606
-Be right back. Okay.
-Okay.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.442
We're gonna go have
a picnic on the beach.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.693
(chuckles):
Oh, wow.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.403
That'll be fun.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.490
Um, yeah, unfortunately, I have
to get going back to work.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.699
So, Ellen, take my seat.

20:42.783 --> 20:43.909
Go ahead.

20:43.992 --> 20:44.993
Sit down.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.998
-Fries?
-(chuckles)

20:50.082 --> 20:52.000
That is so gorgeous.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.168
Oh, thanks.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.170
Yeah, it's a Donna Martin
original.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.296
You make your own clothes?

20:56.380 --> 20:57.839
Mm-hmm.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.841
Yeah, she has
a whole store of them.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.843
See, Donna is this amazing,

21:01.927 --> 21:05.514
sexy, chic, unstoppable
designer/businesswoman

21:05.597 --> 21:07.724
who's way too with it
to be pining.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.309
Bye.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.520
(chuckles)
I paid her to say that.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.938
Just kidding.

21:13.021 --> 21:13.897
She's my best friend.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.023
It's her job to oversell.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.149
Anyway...
(chuckles)

21:16.233 --> 21:18.360
So, uh, how long have
you and Noah known each other?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.445
Oh, we just met last night.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.530
At the bar.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.531
Oh.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.533
Wow.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.832
Ellen, um, what do you do?

21:31.915 --> 21:34.543
Um...
(clears throat)

21:34.626 --> 21:35.335
I'm a temp.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.337
I-I mean, I don't

21:37.421 --> 21:39.840
own my own company or anything,
but, um, I get by.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.384
Oh, th-that sounds fun,

21:42.467 --> 21:44.594
getting to work
in new places all the time,

21:44.678 --> 21:45.595
meeting new people.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.639
Um, would you excuse me?

21:47.723 --> 21:51.018
I... I left my purse in the car.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.394
Sure.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.446
They got hills like that
on your grandpa's farm

22:02.529 --> 22:04.406
in upstate New York?

22:04.489 --> 22:05.449
We call them molehills.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.410
All right. Come on.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.581
(engine revving)

22:19.254 --> 22:20.756
Whoo-ha!

22:20.839 --> 22:22.758
Whoo!

22:22.841 --> 22:24.593
Come on!

22:36.396 --> 22:38.440
(excited shouting)

23:07.552 --> 23:09.429
You all right?

23:10.430 --> 23:12.474
Yeah.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.309
Is that how they ride
in upstate New York?

23:14.392 --> 23:17.187
(chuckles, groans)

23:17.270 --> 23:19.147
No, it was me being stupid.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.483
(people chattering in distance)

23:21.566 --> 23:24.069
What's going on over there?

23:25.695 --> 23:26.905
DYLAN:
I don't know.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.532
That's where we were
going to camp, but, uh,

23:28.615 --> 23:30.617
looks like
they got other plans.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.462
I've been watching
you guys ride.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.755
Nice jump.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.632
Thanks.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.509
So, when's the party start?

23:47.592 --> 23:48.677
You got an invitation?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.345
It's in my other pants.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.305
It starts at half past whenever.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.390
Don't be late.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.643
And, uh, make sure you bring
your stuntman with you.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.521
(chuckles)

24:17.789 --> 24:20.917
Hey, Donna, that was
a double order of fries.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.210
I'm not proud.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.837
(chuckles)

24:24.796 --> 24:27.716
Hey. Where's Ellen?

24:27.799 --> 24:30.177
Uh, she said she left
her purse in the car.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.261
Guess she'll be right back.

24:31.344 --> 24:32.429
Oh.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.431
So, what do you think?

24:34.514 --> 24:37.058
She seems nice.

24:37.142 --> 24:41.188
Yeah, yeah. It's like we have
this, um, connection, you know.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.940
I just like her.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.859
And I'm happy for you.

24:45.942 --> 24:46.943
Yeah.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.200
All right.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.243
She's fine. No damage.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.703
I'm telling you,
Kelly's gonna kill me.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.038
Not if you don't tell her.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.915
You kidding me?
She's all-knowing.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.083
Besides, I don't think
I can walk without a limp.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.753
Secret's safe with me.

25:04.836 --> 25:05.795
Thanks.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.756
(rock music playing
over speakers)

25:07.839 --> 25:10.258
Get some more ice.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.929
♪ Can you face me
with all my crimes? ♪

25:14.012 --> 25:17.015

leave me this time? ♪

25:18.183 --> 25:19.476

25:19.559 --> 25:21.770
Sure.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.104
Still hurts, huh?

25:23.188 --> 25:25.941
Ah, be fine by tomorrow.

25:26.024 --> 25:26.942
(sighs)

25:27.025 --> 25:28.902
So, you guys spending the night?

25:28.985 --> 25:32.322
Yeah.
That's, uh, that's the plan.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.825
Here, try this.

25:37.244 --> 25:41.414
Well, that's the biggest
mai tai I've ever seen.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.250
Yeah, it puts aspirin to shame.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.503
I helped make it myself.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.296
It's good.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.172
Thanks.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.174
Hey, come on,
let me show you around.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.676
Hey, Buddy, I'll be back.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.636
Gotcha.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.226
Careful, you're spilling it.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.313
Hey, forget it, Scoropsky.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.440
I didn't hunt down
the best acid in town

26:07.524 --> 26:09.192
to give it away for free.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.319

Hey.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.526
How'd you find me?

26:51.609 --> 26:54.571
In group, you said how much
you love passing out

26:54.654 --> 26:55.905
in the ladies' room here.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.201
They have velvet couches.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.661
I was waiting for you.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.705
Look, you can hate me
if you want to, okay?

27:03.788 --> 27:05.999
-You're going to eventually.
-Look, what's going on with you?

27:06.082 --> 27:08.251
Huh?

27:08.335 --> 27:09.502
Hey, talk to me.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.212
I don't understand
what's going on.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.756
One minute we're taking off
on a picnic,

27:12.839 --> 27:14.215
and then you're gone.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.093
Why don't you just
go on a picnic with Donna?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.219
Super successful Donna.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.722
All right, look, I'm getting you
out of here. Come on.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.432
She disapproves.

27:22.515 --> 27:25.060
Me, of us.

27:25.143 --> 27:29.272
I'm Ellen-- the loser typist.

27:29.356 --> 27:32.609
And Donna's this
clothing big shot.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.403
I don't even know
what you're doing here.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.447
Look, I got you a job.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.615
Okay?

27:38.698 --> 27:41.076
It's full-time, steady work.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.118
Distributor I know was hiring.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.536
So I thought of you.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.955
It's light typing,
good phone skills...

27:47.624 --> 27:49.292
...great personality.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.920
Sounds like you to me.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.297
Thank you.

27:54.381 --> 27:57.425
Well, I did the easy part.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.135
Rest is up to you.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.108
KELLY:
I am so sorry.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.944
Kelly, you don't have
to apologize.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.779
I just feel like this campaign

28:17.862 --> 28:19.614
has taken on a whole life
of its own.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.908
Well, it's almost over.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.494
Hey, um, did Steve come by
to pick up that check?

28:24.577 --> 28:26.079
Yeah, he did.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.580
And he's still here.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.999
Actually, that's why
I was calling you.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.668
He's still there? Why?

28:31.751 --> 28:34.546
Maybe you should come
and see for yourself.

28:39.717 --> 28:41.761
(techno-pop playing)

28:41.845 --> 28:43.263
(people chattering, whooping)

28:59.737 --> 29:02.031
(bicycle bell rings)

29:11.958 --> 29:13.376
Hey, hey, hey.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.753
There's a guy over there--
he has blue spray paint,

29:15.837 --> 29:17.714
and he's spraying
on people's skin.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.467
And it's so blue that it makes
your teeth really, really white.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.051
I thought you should know that.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.553
Do you feel all right?

29:23.636 --> 29:26.514
Yeah, yeah, man.
I feel so good it's scary.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.142
'Cause, you know, we can be back
in L.A. in a couple hours.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.519
Oh, no, no, no.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.022
It feels good
to be out of town. It does.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.526
So do you dance, or what?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.987
Uh, not really.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.239
Well, come and watch me then.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.328
(giggles)

29:48.411 --> 29:49.537
Doesn't hurt to watch.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.747
Ah.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.832
(chuckles)

29:54.584 --> 29:56.711
You know, thanks for
setting this up, man.

29:56.794 --> 30:00.089
I thought you were a real jerk,
but no way. I was way off, man.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.508
Come on.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.718
(imitating dirt bike engine)

30:03.801 --> 30:06.346
Take it easy
on the desert juice, huh?

30:21.444 --> 30:22.403
Hi.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.697
Hello.

30:27.492 --> 30:31.287
Now, Steve, point the shaft
of that kielbasa skyward.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.540
Not a problem.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.375
Oh... my God.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.626
I know.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.878
Oh, good. Let's get
some shots of that.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.880
Hurry, hurry.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.507
Oh, incredible.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.176
(laughs) You like that?
Looking good, Steve.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.553
Show me a muscle.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.721
-Muscle?
-Excellent.

30:48.805 --> 30:49.931
That's great.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.226
Oh, that's strong.
That's strong.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.310
Very good.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.270
Oh, that's perfect.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.272
Now, get all this, okay?

30:57.355 --> 30:59.482
Okay, ladies...

30:59.566 --> 31:01.734
you want Steve's sausage.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.571
It's very important to you.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.453
BORST:
Oh, that's perfect.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.496
You like that?

31:13.580 --> 31:15.456
Oh, that's good.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.253
Okay, everyone,
let's take a break.

31:20.336 --> 31:23.840
Say, uh, long enough to consider
other career options.

31:28.469 --> 31:29.637
Hey, baby.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.514
It's Daddy.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.308
I thought you were
picking up Chinese food.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.767
You didn't tell her?

31:34.851 --> 31:36.769
I couldn't find the right words.

31:36.853 --> 31:37.979
I'm the Sausage King.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.315
Yo! Ha!

31:40.398 --> 31:42.317
Oh? Tell me more.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.818
Well, Mr. Borst likes
my Nordic good looks.

31:43.901 --> 31:46.321
Does Jerry know your ancestors
are from Phoenix?

31:46.404 --> 31:48.990
He took one look at me
and he saw dollar signs.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.325
And so did I.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.701
He's talking national spots!

31:51.784 --> 31:52.994
WOMEN:
Bye.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.537
(giggling)

31:58.583 --> 32:01.836
Why don't I have the P.A.
make you a nice sandwich, okay?

32:01.919 --> 32:04.547
-Todd? Todd?
-(snaps fingers)

32:11.596 --> 32:14.140
(soft rock music playing)

32:25.443 --> 32:26.944
Closing up?

32:27.945 --> 32:28.988
Yeah.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.365
30% off today.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.908
Nothing left untouched.

32:31.991 --> 32:34.327
If you're looking for Camille,
I don't know where...

32:34.410 --> 32:35.536
She's at the gym.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.746
There you go.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.500
I'm sorry for what you saw.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.710
For not having

32:42.794 --> 32:45.672
the tact to realize
it would bother you.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.839
Thanks.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.883
So, Camille's got this idea

32:48.966 --> 32:49.884
in her head that I...

32:49.967 --> 32:53.554
Last night, I, um, I was
cleaning out my closet

32:53.638 --> 32:56.432
and I found...
and I found that dress

32:56.516 --> 32:58.726
that I wore
to our Christmas dance.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.020
Remember the one
with the horrible rhinestones

33:01.104 --> 33:02.021
all over it?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.064
Yeah.

33:03.147 --> 33:07.026
Every time I tried to touch it,
they scratched me.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.278
I think that's exactly
what my mom wanted. (chuckles)

33:09.362 --> 33:11.948
You told me in the parking lot
that you were proud to be going

33:12.031 --> 33:14.575
to the dance with the best
dancer at West Beverly.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.285
-I did not say that.
-Yes, you did.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.286
(sighs)

33:17.370 --> 33:20.373
Oh, my God, how lame was I?

33:20.456 --> 33:22.500
I also remember kissing you.

33:27.004 --> 33:31.175
Well, it's, it's impossible
to know how much you've changed

33:31.259 --> 33:33.219
unless you look back.

33:34.470 --> 33:35.805
Guess we've changed a lot, huh?

33:37.140 --> 33:39.225
-I should...
-Well, I should...

33:39.308 --> 33:42.103
I should get this done, yeah.

33:46.357 --> 33:49.318
I'm sorry, again.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.654
Me, too.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.532
Good night.

33:54.615 --> 33:57.118
What, um... what did you want
to talk to me about?

33:57.201 --> 33:58.202
Something about Camille?

33:58.286 --> 34:00.079
No, nothing. Never mind.

34:01.539 --> 34:05.793
Um, the-the dress
with the... rhinestones--

34:05.877 --> 34:07.295
did it still fit?

34:07.378 --> 34:10.172
I didn't try it on.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.135
Good night.

34:29.734 --> 34:33.321
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

34:33.404 --> 34:35.656
(dance music playing)

34:35.739 --> 34:38.201
Matt Durning, attorney at law.
I'm networking with you.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.494
Matt Durning, attorney at law!

34:39.577 --> 34:41.161
I'm networking with you!

34:41.245 --> 34:42.246
Matt Durning, attorney at law!

34:42.330 --> 34:43.498
I'm networking with you!

34:43.581 --> 34:44.373
Matt Durning, attorney at law!

34:44.456 --> 34:47.335
I'm networking with you people!
Come on!

34:47.418 --> 34:49.879
You know, I-I've never seen
a lawyer

34:49.962 --> 34:51.714
drumming up business at a rave.

34:51.797 --> 34:54.509
Yeah, well, he, uh,
he doesn't get out much.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.135
(woman chuckles)

34:56.219 --> 34:57.845
Oh, man, I feel good,
I feel good.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.597
You never told me what's in
this stuff.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.559
Um, uh, fruit punch
and a teensy bit of liquid acid.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.187
Acid? Like the drug acid?

35:06.270 --> 35:07.897
Well, just a teensy little bit.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.690
I don't do drugs.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.692
Oh.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.530
(laughing)

35:15.613 --> 35:16.781
(woman laughs)

35:18.449 --> 35:19.992
Come on. Let's dance.

35:20.076 --> 35:20.993
Whoo-hoo!

35:21.077 --> 35:22.036
(laughing)

35:24.831 --> 35:26.874
So are you two, like,
best friends?

35:26.958 --> 35:30.711
No, we're in love
with the same woman.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.713
Oh, cozy.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.340
Mm.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.551
So what do you think's
gonna happen?

35:36.634 --> 35:39.345
He's gonna marry her.

35:39.428 --> 35:42.431
Me? I don't know.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.517
Oh.

35:47.603 --> 35:48.729
Come on.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.439
I want to show you my tent.

35:50.523 --> 35:53.442
Come on. Come on!

35:53.526 --> 35:54.360
(Dylan chuckles)

35:54.443 --> 35:56.445
(people shouting, whooping)

36:13.170 --> 36:14.964
(tent flap unzips)

36:16.883 --> 36:18.384
Morning.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.386
Hey, did you get any sleep?

36:20.469 --> 36:22.388
(chuckles):
No.

36:22.471 --> 36:23.389
(sighs)

36:23.472 --> 36:25.391
Seen my friend?

36:25.474 --> 36:27.476
-Last time I saw
the engaged guy... -Mm-hmm.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.521
...he was under those trees
over there, baying at the moon.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.441
Wow. Excellent use
of the word "bay."

36:33.524 --> 36:34.483
(both chuckle)

36:34.567 --> 36:35.443
Come on.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.238
(both grunt)

36:42.199 --> 36:43.117
Look out.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.410
Come on.

36:44.493 --> 36:45.453
Hey.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.581
Sleepyhead?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.461
What time is it?

36:53.544 --> 36:55.671
What time is it?
Time to hit the trail.

36:55.755 --> 36:56.839
Come on.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.802
Whoa, geez.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.846
WOMAN:
Ow!

37:05.014 --> 37:08.100
Your knee hit me
right in the thigh.

37:10.269 --> 37:12.980
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.148
My mistake.

37:15.274 --> 37:16.525
My mistake.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.529
(sighs)

37:43.636 --> 37:45.805
How long have you been up?

37:45.888 --> 37:48.224
Uh, uh, I don't know.

37:48.307 --> 37:49.684
Since 5:00, 5:30.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.520
Plundering the shores again,
dear?

37:52.603 --> 37:55.523
No, I was working out, okay?

37:55.606 --> 37:56.899
As Sausage King,
it's important

37:56.983 --> 37:59.527
that I maintain
a certain imposing stature.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.653
(door opens)

38:00.736 --> 38:01.487
KELLY:
Hello?

38:04.615 --> 38:06.701
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.328
Bad news, Thor.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.913
The reign of
the Sausage King is over.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.540
What are you talking about?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.375
The Viking concept was great.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.585
Mr. Borst changed
his idea again.

38:16.669 --> 38:19.088
This was your idea, wasn't it?

38:19.171 --> 38:20.381
It was my job.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.924
Wasn't like me
to stand on the sidelines

38:22.008 --> 38:24.260
or you to get drunk
on the power of lead bun.

38:24.343 --> 38:25.219
Mm-mm.

38:25.302 --> 38:27.763
But seeing you wielding
a two-foot sausage

38:27.847 --> 38:30.349
was a little more
than I could take.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.226
-I know. It's a lot.
-Mm.

38:32.309 --> 38:33.561
Speaking from experience, honey?

38:33.644 --> 38:37.523
Anyway, I went
with my original idea,

38:37.606 --> 38:38.733
and he loved it.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.443
You'll get paid for the day.

38:40.526 --> 38:41.402
But unfortunately,

38:41.485 --> 38:43.237
I'm gonna need
that Viking costume back.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.238
-It's a rental.
-It's upstairs.

38:44.321 --> 38:47.241
Okay, okay, okay,
so the Viking thing is out.

38:47.324 --> 38:51.454
How about French or maybe
Northern Italian, huh? Huh?

38:51.537 --> 38:52.538
Honey.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.290
-What?
-You need to give Kelly

38:54.373 --> 38:55.374
the hat back, okay?

38:55.458 --> 38:57.376
Steve.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.421
KELLY:
Thank you.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.589
(chuckles)

39:01.672 --> 39:03.382
-Bye.
-Bye.

39:04.383 --> 39:05.426
(chuckles softly)

39:05.509 --> 39:08.971
Well, tonight in bed,

39:09.055 --> 39:11.265
you can still call me "Helga."

39:11.348 --> 39:13.184
(laughs devilishly)

39:13.893 --> 39:17.229
Yo! Ha! Yo!

39:17.313 --> 39:19.440
DYLAN: <i> What's the last thing</i>
<i>you remember?</i>

39:19.523 --> 39:21.233
Mud, stripes.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.277
Mud stripes on a girl's back.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.487
Me as the artist.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.489
I heard before I enrolled

39:26.572 --> 39:27.740
that law school changes you,
you know?

39:27.823 --> 39:29.283
It makes you... it makes you
too careful.

39:29.366 --> 39:30.993
One loose floorboard,

39:31.077 --> 39:34.121
one impulsive moment
can ruin lives.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.291
Look, Matt, last night
doesn't have to ruin anything.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.627
That girl, Amy,
said it's no big deal.

39:42.421 --> 39:44.548
No big deal.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.642

39:54.725 --> 39:59.063

that I still care? ♪

39:59.146 --> 40:00.314

40:00.397 --> 40:03.776

40:03.859 --> 40:05.653

40:08.781 --> 40:09.824
Hey. Hey, come in.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.327
I just... I just put on a song.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.164
I missed you.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.165
Yeah?

40:18.249 --> 40:21.502
How come you haven't returned
any of my calls?

40:22.628 --> 40:26.841
Well, I thought about
calling you here.

40:26.924 --> 40:31.137
But the last time I did that,
we ended up upsetting Donna.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.056
I thought about
mailing you a note,

40:34.140 --> 40:37.017
but then, uh, I was afraid
that Donna would see it

40:37.101 --> 40:39.520
in the outgoing mail
and she'd get her feelings hurt.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.522
Donna's a pretty big part
of my life.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.690
Yeah, mine, too.

40:42.773 --> 40:48.362
But I realize that the only way
that you and I can exist

40:48.445 --> 40:51.365
separately from her
is if I quit the store.

40:51.448 --> 40:52.867
Which I don't want to do.

40:52.950 --> 40:56.328
Or if you and I move to Canada.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.705
Is that what you want?

40:57.788 --> 40:59.582
(chuckles)

40:59.665 --> 41:02.251
Come here.

41:02.334 --> 41:05.004
It's a little drastic.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.214
Camille, you asked me
to figure this out, all right?

41:07.298 --> 41:10.509
But the truth is... we're fine.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.679
But if it makes you feel
any better,

41:13.762 --> 41:15.639
we can go update
our passports today.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.524
You know...

41:28.360 --> 41:30.279
...the point of my fantasy...

41:30.362 --> 41:31.739
Mm-hmm?

41:31.822 --> 41:33.365
...is that when you and I
are together...

41:33.449 --> 41:35.409
Mm-hmm?

41:35.492 --> 41:39.205
...no one else exists.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.041
You know what I'm saying?

41:42.124 --> 41:43.500
Yeah.

41:45.794 --> 41:46.712
Good.

41:46.795 --> 41:48.714
(David chuckles)

42:15.532 --> 42:16.408
Hi.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.452
Hey. The 10 was backed up.

42:18.535 --> 42:20.621
I was gonna call, but I didn't
want to wake anyone.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.165
Mmm, come to bed.

42:28.671 --> 42:29.755
Yeah.

42:37.471 --> 42:38.973
You okay?

42:39.056 --> 42:41.725
I missed you.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.646
Go back to sleep.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.776
Everything's fine.
