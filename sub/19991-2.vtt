01:04.330 --> 01:09.900
Sorry about this barnacles,
but it's spring cleaning time.

01:09.902 --> 01:11.469
- I forgive you.

01:13.573 --> 01:17.508
I take it back!

01:21.980 --> 01:25.950
- There, my masterpiece.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.786
What the--ahh!

01:33.026 --> 01:35.359
- Ah, perfect.

01:35.361 --> 01:39.630
No!

01:39.632 --> 01:44.435
What is that menace
up to now?

01:48.573 --> 01:51.942
How many--

01:51.944 --> 01:54.045
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:54.047 --> 01:59.050
- Will you please
turn that thing--

01:59.052 --> 02:00.618
- Oh, hey, Squidward.

02:03.356 --> 02:04.655
- What are you saying?

02:09.329 --> 02:10.428
Yay!

02:10.430 --> 02:13.731
- I can't hear you
over the hose noise.

02:13.733 --> 02:17.368
Hold on, I'll turn it off.

02:17.370 --> 02:21.806
Aww.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.410
- What's you want
to tell me, Squidward?

02:26.412 --> 02:27.411
- Turn off the hose.

02:27.413 --> 02:30.081
- I already did. Here, I'll turn
it back on just for you.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.883
- No, no, no. wait--

02:32.885 --> 02:34.585
- Yep, it was off.
How'd I do?

02:34.587 --> 02:39.623
- Horrible!
Everything you do is horrible!

02:39.625 --> 02:42.360
I wish you would
just move away already.

02:42.362 --> 02:46.831
- Move away?
But Squidward, I like it--

02:48.935 --> 02:53.437
- Did you see that? Huh, I
wonder what's making me sneeze.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.638
- Ahh!

02:54.640 --> 02:57.641
Probably all the barnacle dust
you kicked up.

02:57.643 --> 02:58.976
- Oh, Squidward,
that makes no sense.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.711
Who ever heard of dust
making you sneeze?

03:00.713 --> 03:03.981
- Oh, fine, maybe you're
allergic to your pineapple.

03:03.983 --> 03:08.786
- You can't be
allergic to a house.

03:10.423 --> 03:15.559
Or could you--
no.

03:16.229 --> 03:19.430
Oh, why do I even bother
trying to explain things to him?

03:19.432 --> 03:22.767
Of course you can be
allergic to a house.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.035
I ju--wait.

03:25.037 --> 03:28.806
You can be allergic
to a house.

03:56.469 --> 03:59.837
Ah, ah, ah.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.742
- Ah.

04:04.744 --> 04:08.679
- Gary, no, no, no, no!

04:11.050 --> 04:14.585
- Aww, playtime, that's nice.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.663
- Good mor--

04:25.665 --> 04:27.231
good mor--

04:27.233 --> 04:29.733
good--

04:29.735 --> 04:33.471
Good morning, Gary.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.713
Ahh!

04:50.922 --> 04:53.791
Ah--ah--ah--

04:53.793 --> 04:55.259
Ahh!

04:55.261 --> 04:59.830
- You okay in there, SpongeBob?

04:59.832 --> 05:01.131
- Oh, morning--

05:01.133 --> 05:02.967
Morning, Squidwa--

05:02.969 --> 05:05.970
- Oh my, having a little
sneezing fit are we?

05:05.972 --> 05:11.141
- Yeah, I think you were right.
I must be allergic to my house.

05:11.143 --> 05:15.145
- Oh, that's too bad.
I guess you'll have to move.

05:15.147 --> 05:18.282
- Move?
- Yes. You can't stay here

05:18.284 --> 05:20.651
or your allergy
will just get worse.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.987
Hey, look at that.
- Look at what?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.722
- See?

05:24.724 --> 05:27.258
Your allergy is already
getting worse.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.728
- But--but where will I go?
- Don't worry, SpongeBob.

05:30.730 --> 05:34.732
I'll help you find
a great new home...

05:34.734 --> 05:35.599
far away from here.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.135
- But, Squidward,
I love this old pineapple.

05:38.137 --> 05:41.539
We've had a lot of good times
together.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.240
Whee!

05:58.724 --> 06:00.925
Oh, Squidward,
my sneezing is getting worse.

06:00.927 --> 06:04.161
I'll miss my pineapple,
but I guess you're right.

06:04.163 --> 06:06.764
I ha-- I have to move.

06:06.766 --> 06:07.731
- Now you're talking.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.800
Trust me, you'll feel
so much better

06:09.802 --> 06:12.169
when you're clear of me--
your pineapple.

06:12.171 --> 06:15.039
- Squidward,
you're a good friend.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.608
- I know.

06:22.147 --> 06:26.350
- This would make a great new
house, what do you think?

07:17.403 --> 07:21.338

- Wait, wait, no, no, no!

07:33.886 --> 07:38.155
- Hey, Squidward, this is great.
What does this button do?

07:47.132 --> 07:49.033
- That's what it does.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.268
Aww, why couldn't I live
in that last place?

07:51.270 --> 07:55.272
- Oh, that house was too
dangerous for you. Ow.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.441
Besides, it was just a house.

07:57.443 --> 08:01.745
But this is a castle
with a moat and everything.

08:01.747 --> 08:04.882
It's a long way
from Bikini Bottom.

08:04.884 --> 08:05.949
- I know.
- Huh?

08:05.951 --> 08:07.084
- I mean,
don't worry about it.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.353
It's a short 11-hour commute
to the Krusty Krab from here.

08:09.355 --> 08:10.821
- Well, I don't know,
Squidward.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.825
It doesn't seem like
the safest neighborhood.

08:15.860 --> 08:19.363
- All right, SpongeBob, this is
the last house on my list,

08:19.365 --> 08:24.068
but I think it's got everything
you're looking for.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.035
What do you think?

08:25.037 --> 08:29.273
- I don't know.
It doesn't look like much.

08:29.275 --> 08:33.844
Wow.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.111
- Pretty!

08:36.381 --> 08:38.115
This place is amazing.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.417
It's like living
in the future.

08:40.419 --> 08:44.054
- Ooh, check out
these cool stairs.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.956
Whee!

08:45.958 --> 08:47.825
- Uh, SpongeBob?
- Whee!

08:47.827 --> 08:51.195
- Squidward? Squidward?

08:52.164 --> 08:53.831
- This place is awesome.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.433
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

08:56.435 --> 08:58.335
I can't believe
I get to live here.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.404
It's so much cooler
than your house.

09:00.406 --> 09:03.407
You're right.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.342
This place is way too cool
for you.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.811
- Wait, what?
- I mean, living in a place

09:07.813 --> 09:11.315
like this can put
a lot of pressure on a guy.

09:11.317 --> 09:13.917
The constant attention
you get,

09:13.919 --> 09:18.288
<i>and all the fabulous parties</i>
<i>you'd host.</i>

09:21.861 --> 09:23.460
Eh?
- Oh, it's quite good.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.462
- Certainly worthy
of this house.

09:25.464 --> 09:26.997
- Indeed.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.832
- Not to mention
all the covers

09:28.834 --> 09:31.335
of "Cool Calamari"
you'd have to pose for.

09:31.337 --> 09:34.838
No, I can't let you
go through that, SpongeBob.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.142
So I tell you what,
I'll live here for you.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.445
- Yeah, but where will I live?
- You can have my old house.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.814
- Really?
That is so nice of you.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.316
That way I'll be one house
closer to Patrick.

09:46.318 --> 09:47.351
- Great, it's a done deal.

09:47.353 --> 09:51.054
So if you don't mind, I have
a lot of settling in to do.

09:51.056 --> 09:52.790
Bye-bye.
- Okay, so I guess

09:52.792 --> 09:55.926
I'll see you la--

09:55.928 --> 10:01.799
- Now this is how
I was always meant to live.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.370
Bedtime.

10:09.574 --> 10:15.112
Oh, a built in alarm clock.
Hoo, this place has got it all.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.588
<i>- Ten, nine, eight...</i>

10:24.590 --> 10:27.124
Wha--what's happening?
<i>- Seven, six, five...</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:29.593
- Oh, no.
It's not an alarm clock.

10:29.595 --> 10:35.132
It's a countdown!
<i>- Four, three, two, one.</i>

10:48.379 --> 10:52.015
<i>Huh? What--what the--</i>
<i>uh.</i>

10:52.017 --> 10:55.519
That was horrible.

10:57.055 --> 10:58.922
<i>But this is even worse!</i>

10:58.924 --> 11:02.226
<i>Ahh!</i>

11:02.228 --> 11:06.897
- Doink.
Now this really feels like home.

11:06.899 --> 11:10.000
Ahh!

11:12.504 --> 11:15.272
- Squidward, you dropped in
for a visit.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.273
- I am not visiting.

11:16.275 --> 11:19.443
This is my house
and I want it back.

11:19.445 --> 11:23.547
- Sorry, Squidward, but you gave
it to me fair and square...

11:23.549 --> 11:24.181
pants.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.050
Besides, if I move out now,
I have no where to go.

11:27.052 --> 11:31.588
- Okay, fine, I'll just take
your old pineapple.

11:31.590 --> 11:32.623
Huh?

11:32.625 --> 11:36.994
- Sorry, Squidward,
but this is my house now.

11:39.231 --> 11:43.600
- Well, then, where am I
supposed to live?

11:43.602 --> 11:47.971
- Night, Squidward.

11:47.973 --> 11:51.141
Ow.

12:04.555 --> 12:09.293
- Maybe I'll do
a cute little button.

12:09.295 --> 12:13.196
Or something a bit more manly
perhaps.

12:16.402 --> 12:20.270
Upturned might be good, too.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.511
- Hi, Squidward.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.180
- Great.
The idiot found me.

12:30.182 --> 12:33.183
- Whatcha doing?
- I'm picking a nose.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.686
- Ooh!
I used to pick my nose too,

12:35.688 --> 12:39.623
until I finally
cleared it out.

12:41.693 --> 12:44.561
- I'm not picking my nose,
SpongeBob.

12:44.563 --> 12:49.099
I'm on the way to the hospital
for a nose job.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.400
Plastic surgery.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.502
I'm finally gonna get
the nose

12:52.504 --> 12:53.804
I should have been born with.

12:53.806 --> 12:57.808
- But, Squidward,
you're a beautiful flower.

12:57.810 --> 13:03.680
You don't need to change
a--ay--yay--yay--ay--

13:03.682 --> 13:05.315
Well, maybe a little work
wouldn't hurt.

13:05.317 --> 13:08.785
Hey, you want a ride?
- With you? Absolutely not.

13:08.787 --> 13:12.089
- Aww, come on, Squidward.

13:12.091 --> 13:16.360
I can get you there
lickity-split.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.332
- You can't dump
your garbage here, sir.

13:22.334 --> 13:25.769
- Oh, that's not garbage.
That's my friend, Squidward.

13:25.771 --> 13:29.806
We're here to check in.

13:29.808 --> 13:33.810
- Holy nostroly! You must be
here for the nose job.

13:33.812 --> 13:38.715
Let's, uh, get your paperwork
filled out.

13:38.717 --> 13:39.716
- You just relax, sir.

13:39.718 --> 13:42.252
The doctor will be ready
for you soon.

13:42.254 --> 13:45.822
Ah. This is nice.

13:45.824 --> 13:46.690
- Never fear, Squidward.

13:46.692 --> 13:50.093
Soon this dreary old room
will be so full of well-wishing

13:50.095 --> 13:51.628
you'll never want to go home.

13:51.630 --> 13:52.763
<i>- Five minutes later.</i>

13:52.765 --> 13:57.667
- SpongeBob,
get this garbage out of here.

13:57.669 --> 13:58.435
I can hardly move.

13:58.437 --> 14:02.305
- Oh, are you uncomfortable?
Here, let me help.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.879
- I love you.
- The bed is fine!

14:08.881 --> 14:10.747
- Fluff your pillow?
- No.

14:10.749 --> 14:14.651
- Fluff your IV bag?

14:14.653 --> 14:16.286
Enough, you buffoon!

14:16.288 --> 14:19.723
- Well, gee, Squidward,
I was just trying to be helpful.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.625
- If you want
to help so badly,

14:21.627 --> 14:26.463
why don't you just go volunteer
to be a candy striper?

14:26.465 --> 14:28.265
There's plenty of other people
in the hospital

14:28.267 --> 14:29.032
you could torture.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.269
- Squidward,
that's a great idea.

14:32.271 --> 14:34.805
I was born to serve.

14:37.842 --> 14:40.644
Hello, lady, can I be
a candy striper here at the--

14:40.646 --> 14:42.679
- Grab a uniform
out of the closet.

14:42.681 --> 14:47.417
- Ooh, thank you!
Thank you! Whoo!

14:47.419 --> 14:51.421
Ooh! Candy stripes.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.490
Strawberry.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.393
- Ah, Doctor,
Thank goodness you're here.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.929
- We were just looking
for another physician

14:58.931 --> 15:01.498
to join us on our rounds.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.934
And what seems to be
the problem today?

15:03.936 --> 15:06.903
My throat hurts.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.306
- Prescribe him
a numbing throat spray.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.508
Let's move on, shall we?
- Wait a second.

15:11.510 --> 15:16.780
I think
I've seen this before.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.917
Mm, yeah.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.519
Mm-hmm.

15:22.521 --> 15:26.690
I'll need one medical
sea-chicken.

15:39.538 --> 15:43.306
Hey, my keys.
And my throat feels better.

15:43.308 --> 15:46.343
- You see, doctors,
catfish are bottom feeders.

15:46.345 --> 15:47.744
The dirt on his face
led me to believe

15:47.746 --> 15:50.647
he had recently eaten something
that irritated his throat.

15:50.649 --> 15:53.316
Happens to my friend Patrick
all the time.

15:53.318 --> 15:57.354
Mm-hmm.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.522
Try a krabby patty
next time, sir.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.892
They go down smooth, and they
taste better than car keys.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.961
- Thanks doc.
- No need to thank me, sir.

16:04.963 --> 16:08.565
I'm here to help.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.333
- What treatment
might you prescribe

16:10.335 --> 16:12.669
for this next patient,
Doctor?

16:12.671 --> 16:13.637
- So what do you think?

16:13.639 --> 16:14.538
Will I be able to run

16:14.540 --> 16:17.240
in the Bikini Bottom marathon
next week?

16:17.242 --> 16:19.676
- Oh, my, no.
I'm afraid you're--

16:19.678 --> 16:23.446
- Of course. Friends don't let
friends miss marathons.

16:23.448 --> 16:26.650
We'll have you up
in no time.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.685
Ah!

16:28.687 --> 16:33.623
- What are you--

16:34.992 --> 16:37.661
- Most unorthodox.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.564
- He's a genius.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.733
- Thanks, doc.
- Ready, set.

16:46.772 --> 16:50.006
- And what seems to be
your problem today, ma'am?

16:50.008 --> 16:52.842
- Sometimes
I Just don't have it in me

16:52.844 --> 16:56.713
to puff up
under my own power.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.816
- Hi, Mrs. Puff.
- No! Not you!

16:59.818 --> 17:02.686
What are you doing here?

17:02.688 --> 17:07.457
- Don't worry, Mrs. Puff.
I'm a doctor...today.

17:07.459 --> 17:08.959
What is this crazy thing?

17:08.961 --> 17:11.627
Looks like some sort
of weird submarine.

17:11.630 --> 17:12.862
- You're kidding,
of course.

17:12.864 --> 17:16.700
We've placed her in an iron lung
to help puff her back up.

17:16.702 --> 17:20.002
- Ha-ha! Dive! Dive!
Up periscope!

17:20.005 --> 17:26.376
Load the torpedoes.

17:30.848 --> 17:34.951
- Help me.

17:34.953 --> 17:38.788
- Hey!

17:51.669 --> 17:53.470
- My legs!

17:53.472 --> 17:54.604
- Never fear, Mrs. Puff.

17:54.606 --> 17:57.941
I haven't lost a patient
all day.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.511
Let's get medical.

18:06.518 --> 18:07.951
- Oh, no.

18:09.388 --> 18:13.757
Oh. Actually, I feel like
my old self again.

18:13.759 --> 18:18.828
But you still don't get
a driver's license.

18:18.830 --> 18:19.429
Oh!

18:19.431 --> 18:24.467
- Wow. I've never seen anyone
work an iron lung like that.

18:24.469 --> 18:25.568
- So awesome.

18:25.570 --> 18:27.904
- We were on our way
to perform a surgery...

18:27.906 --> 18:31.675
- But we would be honored
to watch you perform it.

18:31.677 --> 18:35.612
- Me?
Perform a surgery?

18:38.115 --> 18:40.517
- Oh, yeah,
this is the life.

18:40.519 --> 18:45.955
And best of all, there's no
SpongeBob here to ruin it.

18:45.957 --> 18:50.026
- Oh, boy, surgery.
And on my first day too.

18:50.028 --> 18:53.463
- SpongeBob? No!
What are you doing here?

18:53.465 --> 18:56.566
- Nighty night,
Mr. Tentacles.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.702
- Wait, wait, no, no, no, no!

19:03.107 --> 19:06.643
- Oh, hi, everybody.
Hi, SpongeBob.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.912
- Doctor,
the patient's over here,

19:08.914 --> 19:10.413
and he's ready for you
to begin.

19:10.415 --> 19:15.485
- Oh, we're most eager to see
which tool you select first.

19:15.487 --> 19:19.622
- Hmm, mm--mm-mm--mm.
Let me see.

19:19.624 --> 19:23.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Phew.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.061
Here we go.

19:31.903 --> 19:36.106
Ooh!
Ah!

19:36.108 --> 19:38.975
- Okay, SpongeBob,
this can't be too hard.

19:38.977 --> 19:42.112
Just make an incision here,
and--no!

19:42.114 --> 19:44.681
Shoot!
Son of a gun!

19:44.683 --> 19:46.649
Ah, my bad.

19:46.651 --> 19:49.018
- I'll take that.

19:49.020 --> 19:52.756
- Ah-ha! Mmm, sushi.

19:59.064 --> 20:01.131
Eeh.

20:01.133 --> 20:05.769
He's uh, really going to pieces
over this nose job.

20:07.072 --> 20:10.006
Oh. Thank you.

20:10.008 --> 20:13.109
Let's try again, shall we?

20:18.015 --> 20:19.783
Order up!

20:25.990 --> 20:29.859
Yow!
That shouldn't be in there.

20:29.861 --> 20:33.563
Ooh!

20:36.001 --> 20:38.535
What?

20:38.537 --> 20:39.669
Oh.

20:39.671 --> 20:40.937
- Ta-da!

20:46.511 --> 20:48.945
Nurse, sponge.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.051
- Thank you, nurse.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.520
- I can't see!
I can't see!

20:57.522 --> 21:01.257
I want to see!

21:04.195 --> 21:08.164
I still can't see.

21:17.542 --> 21:18.541
- Ta da!

21:25.016 --> 21:25.782
There we go.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.983
You can wake him up now,
nurse.

21:26.985 --> 21:30.220
What--what happened?

21:30.222 --> 21:33.556
- I finished your nose job,
you silly goose.

21:33.558 --> 21:34.657
Take a look.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.059
- SpongeBob, you idiot.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.628
This isn't even close
to what I wanted.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.097
- Well, why didn't you say so?
Oh, nurse!

21:41.099 --> 21:45.668
- Wait, no, no, no!
I want a different doctor. I--

21:49.006 --> 21:51.140
No.

21:51.142 --> 21:53.176
No.
No.

21:53.178 --> 21:55.578
No.
No.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.914
No.
No.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.583
No!
No.

22:00.585 --> 22:04.187
No.
No--o--o--o--o!

22:09.093 --> 22:13.096
Stop! I don't want to change
my nose anymore.

22:13.098 --> 22:16.299
SpongeBob, I'll do anything.
Anything at--

22:16.301 --> 22:20.069
- How's about
the Squidward Classic?

22:20.071 --> 22:21.771
- Hey, not bad.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.107
This looks even better
than my old nose.

22:24.109 --> 22:27.944
- Well, I did have to use
a few of your other body parts

22:27.946 --> 22:30.380
to re-sculpt it.

22:30.382 --> 22:33.316
D'oh! Look at the time.
I have to go to work.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.985
- But you're a doctor.
You're at work.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.620
- No, I'm just a fry cook.

22:37.622 --> 22:40.657
But it was fun
playing with you guys. Bye!

22:40.659 --> 22:44.761
- Fry cook?
Ooh.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.329
- Don't be afraid, ladies.

22:46.331 --> 22:49.766
This sinus Adonis
is on the market.
