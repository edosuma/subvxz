00:00.250 --> 00:01.565
<i>So here's what 
you mised on Glee</i>

00:01.617 --> 00:02.951
<i>Coach Beiste is head over heels
for a guy</i>

00:03.036 --> 00:04.420
<i>named Cooter
who's a football recruiter.</i>

00:04.504 --> 00:06.425
<i>Rachel's running for class
president against Kurt and Brittany</i>

00:06.426 --> 00:07.400
and a guy from the hockey team.

00:07.492 --> 00:08.491
Vote Rick "The Stick"!

00:08.531 --> 00:10.081
<i>Burt's running for Congress
against Sue</i>

00:10.133 --> 00:11.750
<i>and Reggie "The Sauce,"
this guy who owns a pizza chain</i>

00:11.801 --> 00:14.136
<i>and who's gonna air a
commercial that'll out Santana.</i>

00:14.220 --> 00:16.138
Everyone's gonna know now,
because of you!

00:16.222 --> 00:17.139
<i>She thought the whole thing
was Finn's fault,</i>

00:17.223 --> 00:18.923
<i>so she slapped him really hard</i>

00:18.975 --> 00:20.525
<i>in front of God and everybody.
Ouch.</i>

00:20.593 --> 00:22.613
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

00:22.715 --> 00:25.301
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

00:25.421 --> 00:27.789
I'm sorry, but since a student
had lit firecrackers

00:27.875 --> 00:30.109
stuffed down his pants
three years ago,

00:30.177 --> 00:33.776
we've had a zero tolerance
physical violence policy.

00:33.870 --> 00:36.132
Is that why you suspended
all the kids who have been

00:36.216 --> 00:38.918
tossing slushees in our faces
for the past two years?

00:38.969 --> 00:41.671
Slushees are not on the school
board's approved list

00:41.755 --> 00:43.422
of suspend-worthy weapons.

00:43.474 --> 00:45.124
Here's what you have to
I didn't do it.

00:45.175 --> 00:46.425
We all saw
what happened.

00:46.477 --> 00:48.177
You slapped Finn in the face,
unprovoked.

00:48.262 --> 00:49.628
No. See, you don't get it.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.681
When I get really pissed off,
Santana gets taken over

00:51.765 --> 00:54.901
by my other evil personality.
I call her "Snixxx."

00:54.968 --> 00:57.069
Her wrath of words is called
"Snixxx juice."

00:57.137 --> 00:58.738
I'm kind of like
the Incredible Hulk.

00:58.805 --> 01:00.523
You can't blame me for anything
Snixxx does.

01:00.607 --> 01:03.109
I'm suspending you
and this Snixxx two weeks.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.610
No argument.

01:04.661 --> 01:07.479
Sectionals is next week.
If you suspend me, I won't be

01:07.531 --> 01:09.282
able to beat Grimace
and Mr. Shue's butts.

01:09.333 --> 01:11.284
Ms. Corcoran, I highly recommend
you do something about this.

01:11.335 --> 01:13.485
I'm sorry, Santana,
Sectionals is important,

01:13.537 --> 01:16.005
but you need to be
punished for what you did.

01:16.089 --> 01:17.656
I hate to say it, but I agree.

01:17.708 --> 01:18.991
This is garbage.

01:19.042 --> 01:20.960
Hamburglar Finn is fine.

01:21.011 --> 01:22.428
She didn't slap me.

01:22.495 --> 01:24.430
I know that it looked
and sounded like she did,

01:24.497 --> 01:26.465
but she actually didn't.

01:26.517 --> 01:28.184
What is it called in a play

01:28.268 --> 01:31.170
or a movie when you pretend to
hit someone but you don't?

01:31.221 --> 01:32.605
A stage slap?

01:32.672 --> 01:34.307
It was a stage slap.

01:34.358 --> 01:35.641
That's what it was.

01:35.692 --> 01:37.777
- What is your angle here, Finn?
- The truth.

01:37.844 --> 01:39.362
If she didn't
actually hit me,

01:39.446 --> 01:40.713
then you can't
suspend her, right?

01:41.282 --> 01:42.481
No.

01:42.533 --> 01:43.983
Then that's what happened.

01:45.569 --> 01:46.786
I'm a mischievous bitch,

01:46.853 --> 01:48.871
but I can't for the life
of me figure out

01:48.956 --> 01:50.156
what the hell
this is about.

01:50.675 --> 01:53.042
Well, I want Sectionals
to be a fair fight.

01:53.126 --> 01:55.107
And that can't happen without
you on the Trouble Tones.

01:55.185 --> 01:56.879
Well, actually, it would only be
a fair fight

01:56.964 --> 01:58.047
with me off the team.

01:58.131 --> 01:59.531
And I also kind of feel
bad for you.

01:59.583 --> 02:01.133
Look, I know we've been
at each other a lot

02:01.201 --> 02:02.251
over these past
couple of years,

02:02.336 --> 02:03.869
but the truth is I think
you're awesome.

02:03.921 --> 02:05.922
And when you hide
who you are,

02:06.006 --> 02:07.256
I feel like you hide

02:07.341 --> 02:09.058
part of that awesomeness
with it.

02:09.142 --> 02:12.178
And that's why you act out

02:12.229 --> 02:14.837
because you hurt inside...
every day.

02:17.436 --> 02:18.850
That's sweet...

02:19.436 --> 02:22.355
but if you think that,
in exchange for keeping me

02:22.406 --> 02:24.190
from getting suspended,
I'm gonna come...

02:24.241 --> 02:26.025
- ...back to the Glee Club?
- Exactly.

02:26.076 --> 02:27.860
You and all the Trouble Tones.
I have an idea

02:27.887 --> 02:31.230
for a lesson but it won't work
out if you're not there.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.732
Did Ms. Corcoran and Mr. Shue
already agree to this?

02:33.784 --> 02:35.868
Look, it's up to you.

02:35.919 --> 02:38.204
Either you can come back
to the choir room

02:38.255 --> 02:41.540
and embrace your awesome
or take a two-week vacation

02:41.592 --> 02:43.626
and enjoy your seat in the
audience for Sectionals.

02:52.719 --> 02:54.854
<i>I haven't been
this worried about a vote</i>

02:54.921 --> 02:56.422
<i>since Lambert versus Allen.</i>

02:56.473 --> 02:59.058
<i>Kurt needs this election
to get into NYADA.</i>

02:59.109 --> 03:01.611
<i>More importantly, he's
clearly the superior candidate.</i>

03:01.695 --> 03:03.380
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

03:03.412 --> 03:04.029
If elected,

03:04.030 --> 03:06.499
I will make sure to have sugary
treats available at all times.

03:06.599 --> 03:07.640
It helps the concentration.

03:07.672 --> 03:08.976
That's what
George Washington said.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.093
<i>I had to take a stand.</i>

03:10.117 --> 03:12.071
She's bribing the students
with Pixy Stix.

03:12.122 --> 03:13.205
Buying votes is illegal.

03:13.273 --> 03:14.740
It's also delicious.

03:14.791 --> 03:16.242
<i>Nobody cares.</i>

03:16.293 --> 03:17.994
<i>They're all so lost
in their own worlds</i>

03:18.078 --> 03:20.112
<i>that they can't see how
important this is to me.</i>

03:20.163 --> 03:22.298
<i>Elections have consequences,</i>

03:22.382 --> 03:24.717
<i>and the consequence of Brittany
winning this election is</i>

03:24.784 --> 03:27.670
<i>that I'll have to move to
New York without my best gay.</i>

03:27.754 --> 03:29.388
<i>What if I need
an emergency makeover</i>

03:29.456 --> 03:30.878
<i>or a last-minute souffl√©?</i>

03:30.906 --> 03:32.791
How's the concession
speech going?

03:32.843 --> 03:34.977
Can I print
an early copy on my blog?

03:35.062 --> 03:36.812
Who says I'm ready to concede?

03:36.897 --> 03:39.065
I'm leading that hockey playing
kid by ten percent.

03:39.132 --> 03:40.349
But that's mostly because

03:40.434 --> 03:41.901
he's in a medically
induced coma after

03:41.968 --> 03:43.235
being brutally checked
in a game last week.

03:43.303 --> 03:45.637
Also, you're trailing Brittany
by 17 points.

03:45.681 --> 03:47.772
If this was a horse race,
you'd be glue.

03:47.889 --> 03:50.076
And te glue that keeps
this school together

03:50.143 --> 03:51.410
when he gets
elected president.

03:51.478 --> 03:53.570
Oh, my God, it's Brittany.
Madam President?

03:53.930 --> 03:55.394
Don't worry about it, okay?

03:55.434 --> 03:57.983
We still have the rest of the day
to change the minds of the voters.

03:58.035 --> 03:59.201
What's the point?

03:59.286 --> 04:00.920
I'm gonna lose unless
I pull a JFK.

04:00.987 --> 04:03.255
You're gonna shoot Brittany?

04:03.323 --> 04:06.709
No, no... when Kennedy ran
against Nixon in 1960,

04:06.793 --> 04:09.962
he had all his Mob buddies in
Chicago stuff the ballot boxes

04:10.013 --> 04:11.130
so that he would win
Illinois.

04:11.181 --> 04:12.664
It won him the presidency.

04:12.716 --> 04:13.849
Wait... No!

04:13.934 --> 04:15.468
No, I can't
let you do this, okay?

04:15.519 --> 04:18.137
Come on. Can't we just do, like,
a great duet in the cafeteria

04:18.188 --> 04:20.101
or the library to just
drum up some support?

04:20.178 --> 04:21.946
I have Kennedy's
impeccable hairline.

04:21.970 --> 04:22.532
I know.

04:22.631 --> 04:25.336
Why can't I have his ends-
justify-the-means mentality?

04:25.461 --> 04:28.047
If I lose, and my resume
remains blank,

04:28.115 --> 04:29.848
I'm not gonna get into NYADA.

04:30.442 --> 04:32.120
And I can't accept that.

04:33.236 --> 04:35.488
You're seriously
considering cheating?

04:37.224 --> 04:39.492
What choice do I have?

04:45.114 --> 04:47.499
Can someone tell us
what's going on, please?

04:47.700 --> 04:49.954
This week, the Trouble Tones
and New Directions!

04:49.996 --> 04:51.404
will both be
singing music created

04:51.428 --> 04:53.643
- by ladies and for ladies.
- Oh, hell no.

04:53.701 --> 04:55.512
Next week, all of us will be
going to Sectionals,

04:55.542 --> 04:57.207
and one of us is
probably gonna win.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.849
But, Santana, we're
worried about you.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.647
Worry about yourself,
fetus face.

05:01.714 --> 05:05.384
Glee's about learning how to
accept yourself for who you are,

05:05.435 --> 05:06.530
no matter
what other people think.

05:06.577 --> 05:07.987
And that's what this music
is all about.

05:08.034 --> 05:10.906
So, wait, I don't even
get a say in this? Not cool.

05:11.508 --> 05:13.784
Everybody in this room knows
about you and Brittany.

05:13.823 --> 05:15.478
And we don't judge
you for it.

05:15.519 --> 05:17.502
We celebrate it
because it's who you are.

05:17.781 --> 05:19.582
Look, I know not everybody
outside of this room

05:19.666 --> 05:21.367
is as accepting and cool,

05:21.418 --> 05:24.336
but we're doing this assignment
this week so that you know

05:24.404 --> 05:28.114
in this rotten, stinking mean
world that you at least have

05:28.146 --> 05:30.065
a group of people who
will support your choice

05:30.071 --> 05:31.338
to be whoever
you want to be.

05:31.578 --> 05:32.445
That's it.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.140
That's what
we're doing here.

05:35.029 --> 05:36.209
Blaine? Kurt?

05:38.453 --> 05:39.718
Santana, Kurt and I have a song

05:39.719 --> 05:41.473
we like to sing to
each other in the car.

05:41.483 --> 05:43.622
And we want to sing
that for you right now.

05:43.673 --> 05:45.657
While there's nothing I'd love
more than having

05:45.709 --> 05:48.461
two Pretty Ponies serenade me,
I think we'd get further

05:48.512 --> 05:51.263
staging a "gel-ervention" for
Blaine than singing lady music.

05:51.331 --> 05:54.133
I know it's hard.
It was hard for me, too.

05:54.184 --> 05:55.434
But you can get
through this.

05:55.502 --> 05:57.186
If you could just stop
being so defensive.

05:57.270 --> 06:00.139
I'm trying, but your hideous
bow ties are provoking me.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.725
Wait, are we talking lady
on lady or girl on girl?

06:02.809 --> 06:03.976
'Cause there's
a big difference.

06:04.027 --> 06:06.612
Puck, focus, okay?

06:07.324 --> 06:10.788
Kurt, Blaine, why don't you
kick us off with what you got?

06:12.235 --> 06:16.122
<i>Made a wrong turn
once or twice</i>

06:16.189 --> 06:21.127
<i>Dug my way out,
blood and fire</i>

06:21.942 --> 06:26.611
<i>Bad decisions,
that's all right</i>

06:26.982 --> 06:31.369
<i>Welcome to my silly life</i>

06:32.305 --> 06:36.542
<i>Mistreated, misplaced,
misunderstood</i>

06:36.593 --> 06:38.877
<i>Miss No-way-it's-all-good</i>

06:38.929 --> 06:42.214
<i>It didn't slow me down</i>

06:42.265 --> 06:47.236
<i>Mistaken,
always second-guessing</i>

06:47.320 --> 06:52.471
<i>Underestimated, look,
I'm still around</i>

06:53.850 --> 06:55.945
<i>Pretty, pretty please</i>

06:56.029 --> 06:58.397
<i>Don't you ever, ever feel</i>

06:58.448 --> 07:04.177
<i>Like you're less than,
less than perfect</i>

07:04.200 --> 07:06.205
<i>Pretty, pretty please</i>

07:06.256 --> 07:11.419
<i>If you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing</i>

07:11.458 --> 07:15.130
<i>You are perfect to me</i>

07:15.215 --> 07:17.383
<i>The whole world stared,
so I swallowed the fear</i>

07:17.434 --> 07:19.802
<i>The only thing I should be
drinking is an ice-cold beer</i>

07:19.886 --> 07:22.388
<i>So cool in lying,
and we try, try, try</i>

07:22.439 --> 07:25.391
<i>But we try too hard,
and it's a waste of my time.</i>

07:25.442 --> 07:27.359
<i>Done looking for the critics
'cause they're everywhere</i>

07:27.427 --> 07:30.479
<i>They don't like my jeans,
they don't get my hair</i>

07:30.564 --> 07:32.898
<i>Strange ourselves,
and we do it all the time</i>

07:32.949 --> 07:34.483
<i>Why do we do that?</i>

07:34.568 --> 07:38.070
<i>Yeah!</i>

07:40.490 --> 07:42.374
<i>Oh, oh-oh-oh</i>

07:42.442 --> 07:45.995
<i>Oh, pretty, pretty please</i>

07:46.079 --> 07:49.965
<i>Pretty, pretty please,
if you ever, ever feel</i>

07:50.050 --> 07:52.718
<i>Like you're nothing</i>

07:52.785 --> 07:57.139
<i>You are perfect to me.</i>

08:02.229 --> 08:03.312
That's good! That's great!
How about that?

08:03.396 --> 08:04.847
Thank you, guys.

08:04.978 --> 08:06.630
Thank you, Finn, especially.

08:06.873 --> 08:09.582
You know, with all the horrible crap
I've been through in my life...

08:10.243 --> 08:12.461
now I get to add that.

08:15.992 --> 08:17.409
<i>Dear Journal,</i>

08:17.477 --> 08:19.361
<i>My campaign is in crisis.</i>

08:19.446 --> 08:21.113
<i>Polls have me neck-and-neck</i>

08:21.164 --> 08:22.481
<i>with Reggie "The Sauce"
Salazar,</i>

08:22.532 --> 08:24.637
<i>and his ad is set
to run any day now.</i>

08:25.071 --> 08:28.029
<i>Why would someone assume I'm
a friend of Ellen just because</i>

08:28.045 --> 08:30.756
<i>I'm mannish and highly
aggressive and have short hair</i>

08:30.823 --> 08:32.758
<i>and I only wear
track suits and I coach</i>

08:32.761 --> 08:34.716
<i>a girl's sport
and I married myself?</i>

08:34.789 --> 08:36.546
<i>It just doesn't make sense.</i>

08:36.591 --> 08:39.679
<i>The truth is, Journal,
I'm attracted to men.</i>

08:39.828 --> 08:42.479
<i>Sure, I can't stand watching
them eat or talking to them,</i>

08:42.534 --> 08:44.401
<i>but when it comes
to getting sexy,</i>

08:44.424 --> 08:47.710
<i>this gal's got a hole in her
heart only a fella can fill.</i>

08:47.730 --> 08:51.040
<i>Salazar's ad will put my
campaign on life-support,</i>

08:51.290 --> 08:53.117
<i>and if I want to win this race,</i>

08:53.147 --> 08:56.065
<i>I need 20 cc's
of man-candy, stat!</i>

08:56.124 --> 08:59.028
<i>So which one of
my hookups is ready</i>

08:59.060 --> 09:00.653
<i>for a prime-time photo op?</i>

09:00.729 --> 09:02.963
<i>Dan Quayle? Too needy.</i>

09:03.014 --> 09:05.266
<i>Stephen Baldwin? Train wreck.</i>

09:05.317 --> 09:07.318
<i>Oliver North. Biter.</i>

09:07.385 --> 09:10.154
<i>Matt Lauer? Too much crying.</i>

09:10.238 --> 09:11.939
<i>Johnny Cochran?</i>

09:12.007 --> 09:13.736
<i>Pretty sure he's dead.</i>

09:14.447 --> 09:16.021
<i>Eureka.</i>

09:16.209 --> 09:18.362
<i>That's the kind of guy I need.</i>

09:18.446 --> 09:21.852
<i>Better luck next time,
David Boreanaz.</i>

09:22.039 --> 09:24.752
<i>Sue Sylvester's found her man.</i>

09:27.663 --> 09:30.715
What is that animal you appear
to be so noisily enjoying?

09:31.043 --> 09:33.744
A chicken stuffed in a duck,

09:33.789 --> 09:36.408
jammed in a turkey...
a turducken.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.515
- It's like a barnyard in a bite.
- Wow.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.968
I've been exhausted lately,
and I'm trying to eat as much

09:41.019 --> 09:42.686
protein as I can
to keep up my strength.

09:42.771 --> 09:43.721
Why are you so tired?

09:43.805 --> 09:44.722
I've been working hard

09:44.806 --> 09:46.913
as the student election advisor,

09:47.061 --> 09:51.599
and my nights have been much
more, well, busier lately.

09:51.802 --> 09:54.488
Well, if you need help with
anything, just let us know.

09:54.489 --> 09:55.160
Yeah.

09:55.418 --> 09:57.768
I could use some help counting
the election ballots.

09:58.541 --> 10:01.481
My quadriceps have been
trembling like jelly all day.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.025
Cooter really pushed me
to my limit last night.

10:04.541 --> 10:06.692
So I take it things
are going well

10:06.743 --> 10:08.161
between you
and Mr. Mankins?

10:08.224 --> 10:10.802
Last night, Cooter asked
me to do something

10:10.803 --> 10:12.619
I never imagined I'd be doing.

10:14.516 --> 10:16.523
You think you can
handle this, Shannon?

10:16.549 --> 10:18.267
Give it to me, Cooter.

10:21.819 --> 10:23.636
Our connection is so amazing

10:23.641 --> 10:25.054
and we have so much
in common.

10:25.117 --> 10:26.918
I really feel like
I met my match.

10:27.003 --> 10:28.787
We are so happy for you, Coach.

10:28.871 --> 10:30.519
Cooter Mankins...

10:31.534 --> 10:33.241
he's the only one for me.

10:44.020 --> 10:49.107
<i>Please, baby, can't you see
my mind's a burning hell?</i>

10:49.192 --> 10:51.393
<i>I got razors a-rippin'
and tearing and strippin'</i>

10:51.444 --> 10:54.196
<i>My heart apart as well</i>

10:56.032 --> 10:59.651
<i>Tonight you told me that
you ache for something new</i>

10:59.735 --> 11:03.605
<i>And some other woman
is looking like something</i>

11:03.656 --> 11:05.373
<i>That might be good for you</i>

11:07.210 --> 11:12.414
<i>Go on and hold her till
the screaming is gone</i>

11:12.465 --> 11:15.917
<i>Go on, believe her when she
tells you nothing's wrong</i>

11:15.968 --> 11:20.755
<i>Ho-ho, but I'm the only one</i>

11:20.806 --> 11:23.842
<i>Who'll walk across
the fire for you</i>

11:26.929 --> 11:32.984
<i>And I'm the only one who'll
drown in my desire for you</i>

11:35.354 --> 11:37.322
<i>It's only fear that
makes you run</i>

11:37.406 --> 11:40.025
<i>The demons that
you're hiding from</i>

11:40.109 --> 11:43.945
<i>When all your promises
are gone</i>

11:43.996 --> 11:50.285
<i>I'm the only one</i>

11:51.587 --> 11:53.988
<i>Please, baby, can't you see?</i>

11:54.040 --> 11:56.491
<i>I'm trying to explain</i>

11:56.542 --> 11:59.844
<i>I've been here before
and I'm locking the door</i>

11:59.929 --> 12:03.331
<i>And I'm not
going back again</i>

12:03.382 --> 12:08.436
<i>Her eyes and arms and skin
won't make it go away</i>

12:08.504 --> 12:10.555
<i>You'll wake up tomorrow
and wrestle the sorrow</i>

12:10.640 --> 12:13.224
<i>That holds you down today</i>

12:13.309 --> 12:20.014
<i>Go on and hold her till
the screamin' is gone</i>

12:20.066 --> 12:25.654
<i>Go on, believe her when she
tells you nothing's wrong</i>

12:25.705 --> 12:31.859
<i>Well, I'm the only one who
walked across the fire for you</i>

12:34.080 --> 12:39.867
<i>And I'm the only one who'll
drown in my desire for you</i>

12:41.554 --> 12:45.256
<i>It's only fear that
makes you run</i>

12:45.341 --> 12:47.976
<i>The demons that
you're hiding from</i>

12:48.043 --> 12:52.347
<i>When all your promises
are gone</i>

12:52.398 --> 12:58.436
<i>I'm the only one</i>

13:07.863 --> 13:09.047
That was for you...

13:09.179 --> 13:10.132
Santana.

13:10.367 --> 13:12.485
Yeah, I know I was just
part of a phase,

13:12.536 --> 13:15.238
but whatever, happy to oblige,
always.

13:29.403 --> 13:31.849
- You kicked ass on that song.
- Thank you.

13:32.052 --> 13:34.185
Do think you need to get
your eyes checked, though.

13:34.236 --> 13:35.415
Say what?

13:35.491 --> 13:38.340
You sang almost the whole song to Shelby.
You hardly even noticed me.

13:38.388 --> 13:40.713
Yeah, that was so that
she would think of me...

13:40.848 --> 13:41.485
think of us...

13:41.486 --> 13:44.034
as the only ones that could
take care of Beth and stuff.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.385
The song was mainly about
baby-sitting for me.

13:47.063 --> 13:50.856
Look, my mom is going on a
Christian wine-tasting boat

13:50.940 --> 13:52.558
down the Ohio River
on Friday.

13:52.642 --> 13:54.109
The Jesus Booze Cruise.

13:54.177 --> 13:56.081
So I'm going to have
the house to myself.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.470
Want to come over, order in,

13:58.532 --> 14:00.639
rent a movie and not watch it?

14:01.616 --> 14:03.467
Remember in the hospital
after Beth was born?

14:04.274 --> 14:05.844
You told me you loved me.

14:06.239 --> 14:07.623
We can get that back.

14:08.395 --> 14:09.875
Sorry. Not interested.

14:10.425 --> 14:12.585
Let me be more clear.

14:13.213 --> 14:15.798
If you come over on Friday,

14:15.865 --> 14:18.200
you get to have sex with me.

14:18.633 --> 14:21.474
Look, I was into you
pretty hard a couple years ago

14:21.503 --> 14:23.366
'cause you were hot
like a pixie and I thought

14:23.397 --> 14:25.205
you were pretty much cooler than
every other girl in the school,

14:25.211 --> 14:27.699
but turns out,
you're kind of nuts.

14:27.761 --> 14:30.479
You're higher maintenance than
Berry and pretty much the most

14:30.546 --> 14:31.814
selfish person I've ever
met in my life.

14:31.881 --> 14:33.381
So thanks for the offer,

14:33.433 --> 14:35.851
but I'd rather
raw dog a beehive.

14:41.441 --> 14:43.826
So, what do you think
of the new assignment?

14:43.893 --> 14:45.494
It's pretty sweet, right?

14:45.561 --> 14:46.895
Do you realize
you're basically

14:46.946 --> 14:49.081
forcing me out
of the flannel closet?

14:49.165 --> 14:50.565
Salazar's ad's going to run.

14:50.617 --> 14:51.950
That's what's forcing
you to deal with this.

14:52.035 --> 14:53.786
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

14:53.870 --> 14:55.671
'Cause I don't want
you to die.

14:56.305 --> 14:57.873
A few weeks ago,
some kid who made one

14:57.924 --> 14:59.708
of those "It Gets Better"
videos killed himself.

15:00.087 --> 15:02.093
You deal with your anxiety
surrounding this stuff

15:02.094 --> 15:03.176
by attacking other people,

15:03.230 --> 15:04.664
and someday, that's not
going to be enough

15:04.665 --> 15:05.998
and you might start
attacking yourself.

15:06.034 --> 15:07.861
Well, thanks, but that's
never going to happen.

15:07.862 --> 15:08.699
I'd miss me too much.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.121
Look, you were my first.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.112
That means something to me.

15:13.826 --> 15:15.042
You mean something to me.

15:15.093 --> 15:16.793
If something ever were
to happen to you,

15:16.878 --> 15:18.157
and I didn't do
everything that I could

15:18.203 --> 15:20.738
to try and stop it, I'd never
be able to live with myself.

15:25.452 --> 15:30.289
<i>I came home
in the middle of the night</i>

15:32.237 --> 15:37.491
<i>My father says what you gonna
do with your life?</i>

15:37.865 --> 15:45.238
<i>Well, Daddy dear,
you're still number one</i>

15:45.290 --> 15:50.494
<i>Oh, girls,
they wanna have fun</i>

15:52.657 --> 15:58.585
<i>Oh, girls, they...</i>

15:58.636 --> 16:03.507
<i>The phone rings
in the middle of the night</i>

16:05.843 --> 16:12.733
<i>My mother says when you gonna
live your life right?</i>

16:12.800 --> 16:19.973
<i>Well, Mother dear,
we're not the founate ones</i>

16:20.024 --> 16:24.745
<i>Oh, girls,
they wanna have fun</i>

16:25.747 --> 16:31.918
<i>Oh, girls, they...</i>

16:31.986 --> 16:37.624
<i>It's all they really want...</i>

16:39.627 --> 16:44.381
<i>Those girls,
they want to have fun</i>

16:48.019 --> 16:53.724
<i>Some boys
take a beautiful girl</i>

16:55.109 --> 16:57.477
<i>Oh, and they hide her away</i>

16:57.528 --> 17:01.148
<i>From the rest of the world</i>

17:03.368 --> 17:05.368
<i>But not me</i>

17:05.453 --> 17:10.957
<i>I wanna be the one
in the sun</i>

17:11.025 --> 17:15.746
<i>Girls, they wanna have fun</i>

17:18.031 --> 17:22.886
<i>Oh, girls, they...</i>

17:22.970 --> 17:27.924
<i>That's all they really want</i>

17:31.396 --> 17:37.350
<i>Those girls,
they wanna have fun.</i>

17:49.319 --> 17:50.769
Thank you.

17:53.658 --> 17:54.978
We love you, Santana.

17:56.704 --> 18:00.590
One four-cheese, ass-kickin',
triple-dippin' chicken taquitos.

18:00.675 --> 18:02.709
Double the chicken.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.645
One Big Daddy Chicken Patty
with extra chicken.

18:05.713 --> 18:07.130
And instead of a side...

18:07.215 --> 18:09.099
- More chicken...
- you just want more chicken.

18:09.183 --> 18:11.456
Yeah. Smile for the camera.

18:12.136 --> 18:14.771
<i>Get those to
the Lima Times ASAP.</i>

18:14.856 --> 18:16.189
Sure thing, Coach.

18:16.257 --> 18:17.107
Hey, Cooter.

18:17.191 --> 18:18.424
What are you doing here?

18:18.476 --> 18:19.459
Oh, hey, Coach.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.562
Just, uh... just grabbing
some dinner with Sue here.

18:22.613 --> 18:25.949
Excuse me, Bluto, but I'm
on a date with my man,

18:26.033 --> 18:28.268
enjoying some disgusting
creamy pasta,

18:28.319 --> 18:30.771
and phoners with several
major media outlets.

18:30.838 --> 18:32.539
So why don't you just
hurry on to your next

18:32.606 --> 18:33.778
face-widening session

18:33.817 --> 18:36.243
at the John Travolta
Institute for Head Thickening

18:36.294 --> 18:37.610
and Facial Weight Gain.

18:37.662 --> 18:38.611
You're on a date?

18:39.351 --> 18:41.146
Y... Yeah, I guess.

18:41.263 --> 18:42.427
Listen, Home Perm,

18:42.505 --> 18:43.722
Cooter's been my
regular booty call

18:43.806 --> 18:45.518
since the late 1990s...

18:45.549 --> 18:49.344
Oop! My iPhone 5 is vibrating.
That's a new feature

18:49.395 --> 18:51.635
of the iPhone 5...
they vibrate now.

18:51.862 --> 18:54.483
<i>And I have to take this... it's
a reporter from USA Today,</i>

18:54.534 --> 18:56.785
the newspaper for people
who can't read.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.523
It's nice to see you, Cooter.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.580
Hey, Shannon, Shannon...

19:05.207 --> 19:06.441
You okay?

19:07.150 --> 19:07.813
No.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.082
No, I'm not.

19:11.171 --> 19:14.886
I thought you and I were
doing stuff, and stuff.

19:14.971 --> 19:16.855
Shannon, I didn't think
you were interested.

19:17.027 --> 19:19.778
Every time I gather up the courage
to ask you out on a date,

19:19.818 --> 19:23.588
we end up lifting weights at
the gym or at a protein seminar.

19:23.731 --> 19:25.768
So, last time, I said to
myself, "Dang it, Coot,"

19:25.898 --> 19:27.048
you just gotta make a move."

19:27.512 --> 19:29.129
And so I tried
to hold your hand,

19:29.184 --> 19:31.319
- and you punched me.
- It was a reflex.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.572
I thought you were trying
to steal my class ring.

19:33.656 --> 19:36.391
I like you, Shannon, and I
like hanging out with you,

19:36.442 --> 19:38.243
but the truth is,
I can't tell

19:38.327 --> 19:40.779
what's going on with us.
I'm not looking for a buddy.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.415
I'm a grown man.

19:43.404 --> 19:44.905
I mean, I need more than that.

19:57.316 --> 20:00.485
I don't have to ask who you
lovely ladies are voting for.

20:00.553 --> 20:03.772
- I'm Team Britt all the way.
- I'm voting for the hockey player.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.654
Rick "The Stick" Nelson.

20:05.816 --> 20:07.431
Well, I wouldn't worry too much

20:07.470 --> 20:09.444
about a spare vote
here or there, Brittany.

20:09.529 --> 20:13.481
My exit polling is putting you
well ahead of Lady Hummel.

20:13.669 --> 20:16.325
This election is "ovah"!

20:16.481 --> 20:17.703
That's right!

20:17.754 --> 20:19.037
Come on.

20:20.109 --> 20:21.893
One last interview
before you lose.

20:21.944 --> 20:24.279
- Hey, hey, hey, give it a break.
- Hey, just one more! Just a word!

20:24.363 --> 20:26.763
God, I feel like a lamb waiting
in line to be slaughtered.

20:26.807 --> 20:27.638
Chin up, Kurt.

20:27.785 --> 20:29.101
It's not over till all
the votes are counted.

20:29.171 --> 20:30.655
Yep, and you're
going to get loads.

20:30.706 --> 20:32.590
Look, look, Quinn is going into
the voting booth right now.

20:32.658 --> 20:34.459
She's definitely going
to vote for you.

20:36.896 --> 20:39.497
<i>I like what Kurt stands
for, and Brittany is insane,</i>

20:39.565 --> 20:41.633
<i>but just like my dad always
voted for the candidate</i>

20:41.701 --> 20:43.218
<i>that was least ethnic,</i>

20:43.302 --> 20:45.670
<i>I'm voting for the one
who's most girl.</i>

20:45.721 --> 20:48.139
<i>Brittany is
my Trouble Tones home girl,</i>

20:48.190 --> 20:49.891
<i>but thank God
for secret ballots</i>

20:49.976 --> 20:51.810
<i>because if Santana's
girlfriend wins this election</i>

20:51.861 --> 20:54.145
<i>I'm never going to hear
the end of it.</i>

21:09.819 --> 21:12.831
<i>If I lose, I don't have a
chance of getting into NYADA.</i>

21:12.882 --> 21:15.000
<i>It's not fair...
the difference between</i>

21:15.051 --> 21:17.252
<i>my dreams coming true and
managing a Sonic Burger</i>

21:17.336 --> 21:20.338
<i>depends on how many people
check a stupid box.</i>

21:27.361 --> 21:28.894
Hey, how's it going?

21:28.946 --> 21:31.414
I can't believe I agreed to let
District hold polling places

21:31.498 --> 21:32.898
in our gym today.

21:32.950 --> 21:34.750
It's like she's
rubbing it in my face.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.419
Don't take it personally.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.838
It's all just a big campaign
strategy for her.

21:38.905 --> 21:41.073
Coach Sue wants
you to have this.

21:41.124 --> 21:42.908
She says she hopes
it rubs it in your face.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.514
I don't understand
what happened.

21:48.582 --> 21:50.266
He said I was
uncommunicative.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.419
Aw, man, I'm so bummed out,
I feel like I'm living

21:53.470 --> 21:55.921
one of the tragic
country music songs.

21:55.973 --> 21:57.974
Well, then you need to go
tell him how you feel.

21:58.058 --> 22:01.049
We're going to go vote, and
you just got to go for it, okay?

22:01.132 --> 22:02.782
When this is all
over and done with,

22:02.850 --> 22:06.194
Sue's going to lose
the election and the guy.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.335
Thanks.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.284
<i>Jolene, Jolene</i>

22:20.352 --> 22:23.371
<i>Jolene, Jolene...</i>

22:23.455 --> 22:25.490
<i>I'm begging of you, please</i>

22:25.541 --> 22:28.284
<i>Don't take my man</i>

22:29.411 --> 22:31.695
<i>Jolene, Jolene</i>

22:31.747 --> 22:35.428
<i>Jolene, Jolene...</i>

22:35.500 --> 22:39.137
<i>Please don't take him
just because you can</i>

22:41.873 --> 22:44.175
<i>Your beauty
is beyond compare</i>

22:44.226 --> 22:46.427
<i>With flaming locks
of golden hair</i>

22:46.512 --> 22:50.398
<i>With ivory skin
and eyes of emerald green</i>

22:52.717 --> 22:55.152
<i>Your smile is like
a breath of spring</i>

22:55.220 --> 22:57.071
<i>Your voice is soft
like summer rain</i>

22:57.155 --> 23:01.108
<i>And I cannot compete
with you, Jolene</i>

23:03.445 --> 23:05.413
<i>He talks about you
in his sleep</i>

23:05.497 --> 23:07.898
<i>And there's nothing
I can do to keep</i>

23:07.950 --> 23:11.452
<i>From crying, when he calls
your name, Jolene</i>

23:14.623 --> 23:16.123
<i>And I could
easily understand</i>

23:16.208 --> 23:18.626
<i>How you could
easily take my man</i>

23:18.710 --> 23:21.379
<i>But you don't know
what he means to me, Jolene</i>

23:23.632 --> 23:25.466
<i>Jolene</i>

23:25.551 --> 23:30.388
<i>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene</i>

23:30.439 --> 23:35.926
<i>Please don't take him
even though you can</i>

23:35.978 --> 23:38.112
<i>Jolene</i>

23:38.196 --> 23:42.817
<i>Jolene</i>

23:42.901 --> 23:45.703
<i>Jolene.</i>

23:45.770 --> 23:47.154
Are you... are
you okay, Coach?

23:48.388 --> 23:50.741
Yeah. Fine.

23:50.792 --> 23:51.826
Are you?

23:52.901 --> 23:54.495
Yep. I'm, I'm great.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.083
Thank you.

24:16.101 --> 24:18.135
Saw the commercial.

24:18.186 --> 24:19.737
Whew. Smokin'.

24:19.804 --> 24:21.322
Who the hell are you?

24:21.406 --> 24:23.574
Josh Comen.
Sophomore rugby captain.

24:23.642 --> 24:24.942
Girls like you
are a challenge.

24:24.993 --> 24:26.777
You just need the right
guy to straighten you out,

24:26.828 --> 24:28.611
and I'm just
the man to do it.

24:28.861 --> 24:31.200
Move your busted creeper ass.

24:31.348 --> 24:31.982
Now.

24:32.034 --> 24:34.485
Easy, girls. I'm just trying
to make her normal.

24:34.536 --> 24:36.153
- She is normal.
- It's not a choice, idiot.

24:36.204 --> 24:38.005
But even if it were,
you'd be our last choice.

24:38.090 --> 24:41.125
Oh, I get it.
You're all a bunch of lesbos.

24:41.176 --> 24:44.378
So what if we are? You don't
stand a chance either way.

24:44.403 --> 24:45.964
Bye-bye.

24:45.999 --> 24:47.382
Walk away.

24:48.333 --> 24:52.303
<i>This was never
the way I planned</i>

24:52.354 --> 24:55.723
<i>Not my intention</i>

24:55.807 --> 24:59.810
<i>I got so brave,
drink in hand</i>

24:59.861 --> 25:03.180
<i>Lost my discretion</i>

25:03.231 --> 25:07.518
<i>It's not what I'm used to</i>

25:07.569 --> 25:10.655
<i>Just wanna try you on</i>

25:10.706 --> 25:13.991
<i>I'm curious for you</i>

25:14.042 --> 25:18.129
<i>Caught my attention</i>

25:18.196 --> 25:21.132
<i>I kissed a girl
and I liked it</i>

25:21.199 --> 25:24.585
<i>The taste of her
cherry Chapstick</i>

25:24.670 --> 25:28.756
<i>I kissed a girl
just to try it</i>

25:28.840 --> 25:31.809
<i>I hope my boyfriend
don't mind it</i>

25:31.876 --> 25:34.345
<i>It felt so wrong</i>

25:34.396 --> 25:36.313
<i>It felt so right</i>

25:36.381 --> 25:39.600
<i>Don't mean
I'm in love tonight</i>

25:39.685 --> 25:43.187
<i>I kissed a girl
and I liked it</i>

25:45.390 --> 25:46.824
<i>I liked it</i>

25:46.891 --> 25:51.195
<i>Us girls, we are so magical</i>

25:51.246 --> 25:52.947
<i>Soft skin, red lips</i>

25:53.031 --> 25:54.615
<i>So kissable</i>

25:54.700 --> 25:58.369
<i>Hard to resist,
so touchable</i>

25:58.420 --> 26:02.256
<i>Too good to deny it</i>

26:02.340 --> 26:06.010
<i>Ain't no big deal,
it's innocent...</i>

26:09.765 --> 26:13.217
<i>I kissed a girl
and I liked it</i>

26:13.268 --> 26:16.804
<i>The taste of
her cherry Chapstick</i>

26:16.888 --> 26:20.758
<i>I kissed a girl
just to try it</i>

26:20.809 --> 26:24.445
<i>I hope my boyfriend
don't mind it</i>

26:24.529 --> 26:26.280
<i>It felt so wrong</i>

26:26.364 --> 26:28.282
<i>It felt so right</i>

26:28.366 --> 26:31.485
<i>Don't mean
I'm in love tonight</i>

26:31.570 --> 26:34.938
<i>I kissed a girl
and I liked it</i>

26:37.275 --> 26:39.744
<i>I liked it.</i>

26:41.830 --> 26:43.164
Come here.

26:43.248 --> 26:45.166
Okay, okay. Update, y'all.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.634
Um, I told my parents
last night,

26:46.718 --> 26:48.002
and they were actually
okay with it.

26:48.086 --> 26:49.754
No way!

26:49.805 --> 26:51.288
I just have to tell my Abuela

26:51.339 --> 26:52.506
before she sees that
stupid commercial.

26:52.591 --> 26:54.507
But luckily she only
watches Univision.

26:55.353 --> 26:58.012
Excuse me, New Directions! and
Trouble Tones singing groups.

26:58.096 --> 27:01.649
Mr. Kurt Hummel, I need to see
you in my office immediately.

27:06.321 --> 27:07.325
First of all, Mr. Hummel,

27:07.378 --> 27:10.018
congratulations on your
early exit poll numbers.

27:10.202 --> 27:12.430
Things are looking very
good indeed for you.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.333
Thank you, Figgins. Now can you
tell me why I'm here today?

27:15.384 --> 27:17.752
There seems to have been
some irregularities

27:17.836 --> 27:19.754
with the student
council ballot boxes.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.839
What do you mean
by irregularities?

27:21.890 --> 27:24.425
Kurt won...
but by 190 votes.

27:24.509 --> 27:25.771
Well, that's great!

27:26.685 --> 27:27.511
Right?

27:27.563 --> 27:28.577
Well, the problem
is there's more

27:28.624 --> 27:30.804
ballots than there are seniors,

27:30.851 --> 27:33.384
and Kurt won by a
suspiciously wide margin.

27:33.435 --> 27:35.885
No, no, I-I didn't do it.

27:36.438 --> 27:38.356
I didn't cheat, I mean, I mean
I thought about it, but I-I-I...

27:38.407 --> 27:40.557
What do you mean
you thought about it?

27:40.609 --> 27:43.828
I... I thought about it because
I-I-I wanted to win so badly,

27:43.895 --> 27:45.329
and I was worried
that I wouldn't.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.427
But, but, I didn't cheat.
I-I worked really hard on this.

27:49.841 --> 27:51.168
I didn't cheat!

27:53.068 --> 27:54.635
Someone stuffed
the ballot boxes.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.303
They think I did it.

27:56.355 --> 27:58.022
If they can prove it,
I could be suspended.

27:58.106 --> 27:59.774
- Oh, my God, Kurt...
- And I lost.

28:00.255 --> 28:01.659
I lost the election.

28:01.743 --> 28:03.977
<i>I lost the lead
in West Side Story.</i>

28:04.029 --> 28:05.496
I can forget about
New York and NYADA,

28:05.580 --> 28:06.980
'cause they'll never
take me now.

28:07.032 --> 28:09.033
You know, the worst part
is that I really,

28:09.117 --> 28:10.284
for a second, thought I won.

28:10.335 --> 28:11.752
Kurt, I'm-I'm so sorry...

28:11.820 --> 28:13.254
I have to find Blaine.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.634
Rachel, I want you to
know, I didn't do this.

28:17.661 --> 28:18.377
I did it.

28:19.011 --> 28:20.961
What? What were you thinking?

28:21.013 --> 28:22.254
I-I-I... I wasn't thinking.

28:22.287 --> 28:24.692
I-I just... I wanted
to help him so bad.

28:31.655 --> 28:33.940
- You have to go tell Figgins.
- I can't, I'll get suspended.

28:33.969 --> 28:35.764
Rachel, Kurt'll get suspended.

28:41.814 --> 28:44.849
Who can tell me
the quadratic equation?

28:44.900 --> 28:46.618
Noah, I told you,
you don't have to

28:46.685 --> 28:48.286
ask permission to
go to the bathroom.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.238
It's x equals negative B
plus or minus

28:50.322 --> 28:52.407
the square root of
B squared minus 4AC.

28:52.491 --> 28:53.875
All over 2A.

28:54.474 --> 28:56.375
That's right.
Who told you?

28:56.860 --> 28:57.747
Um, I did.

28:57.876 --> 28:59.852
I've been doing the books
for my pool-cleaning business.

28:59.927 --> 29:01.427
I've got mad math skills, yo!

29:01.532 --> 29:03.734
<i>I'm like that Beautiful Mind
guy,</i> without all the crazy.

29:05.419 --> 29:06.703
You're go for Puckerman.

29:10.051 --> 29:12.613
- Class isn't over!
- Sorry. Family emergency.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.182
What happened? Where is she?

29:19.249 --> 29:20.516
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
called you, I just...

29:20.584 --> 29:22.585
- I don't have anybody else.
- Is she okay?

29:22.636 --> 29:24.520
She's with the doctor.
She slipped and

29:24.588 --> 29:27.106
hit her lip on the floor,
and there was blood everywhere.

29:27.191 --> 29:28.775
I turned my back
for three seconds.

29:28.859 --> 29:30.026
I'm freaking out now.

29:30.093 --> 29:31.260
They won't even let me
in the room with her.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.979
It's cool. I'm here now.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.981
Hi. Uh, her bottom
tooth went through her lip.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.699
Couple stitches, she'll be fine.

29:36.767 --> 29:39.335
Really? Wait. I want her to
see a plastic surgeon first.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.571
Well, I've gen
plenty of stitches.

29:41.622 --> 29:44.273
I live a somewhat active
lifestyle... judo, paintball...

29:44.325 --> 29:46.459
which means I've had more
stitches than Frankenstein,

29:46.543 --> 29:47.961
so if anyone's gonna
touch Beth's face,

29:48.412 --> 29:50.007
it's gonna be
a plastic surgeon.

29:50.379 --> 29:51.983
I'll page her.

29:56.138 --> 29:58.112
It's okay.
I'm here now.

29:58.229 --> 30:00.097
Everything's gonna be okay.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.146
Yeah. I did a good job.

30:07.231 --> 30:08.598
You're very pretty.

30:08.649 --> 30:11.133
You know, the advantage
of a relationship

30:11.185 --> 30:14.187
with a younger dude is that I
still got four me rounds in me

30:14.271 --> 30:15.655
before I need a steak
sandwich and a Coke Zero.

30:15.739 --> 30:17.774
You need to go.

30:17.825 --> 30:19.742
Before Beth wakes up.

30:20.911 --> 30:22.779
This was a mistake.

30:22.830 --> 30:24.614
I was a mess at the hospital.

30:24.665 --> 30:26.199
Yeah, I was like
freakin' Wolverine.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.867
Beth would have a big
scar on her lip

30:27.880 --> 30:29.437
for the rest of her life
if it weren't for me.

30:29.753 --> 30:32.705
Okay. This is just wrong. Go.

30:32.790 --> 30:33.873
Please. Go.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.208
You know what?

30:35.292 --> 30:36.492
Screw you.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.211
Yeah, you got
the boom and the pow,

30:38.295 --> 30:40.513
and your lips are cash money,
but what really turned me on

30:40.597 --> 30:42.432
about you was how much of
an ass-kicker you were.

30:42.499 --> 30:43.883
Winning all those
championships,

30:43.967 --> 30:47.002
going to New York, raising
Beth alone... all garbage.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.305
This was your chance to
get in on the ground floor

30:49.356 --> 30:51.107
of something really
special... me.

30:52.095 --> 30:54.685
But you're too much of
a coward to go for it.

31:01.438 --> 31:03.672
Santana,
you're all bones.

31:03.724 --> 31:05.845
Like Jesus on the cross.
Eat.

31:05.908 --> 31:08.667
Abuelita, I have something that
I want to talk to you about...

31:08.697 --> 31:11.607
Okay, who cares, talk
with your mouth full, hm?

31:12.566 --> 31:14.350
No, no, no. Come on.

31:14.401 --> 31:16.185
Come on.
Hmm?

31:18.572 --> 31:20.156
Ah. Okay.

31:24.998 --> 31:26.143
Look...

31:26.825 --> 31:29.715
I have to tell you a secret;
a secret that I've

31:29.800 --> 31:32.385
- kept hidden for a long time, but...
- You need salsa...?

31:32.469 --> 31:33.688
<i>No, no, no. Esc√∫chame.</i>

31:33.975 --> 31:35.132
Please...

31:35.866 --> 31:38.244
- You're so special to me.
- Santana, are you pregnant?

31:38.276 --> 31:39.861
Because I will beat you
up with this chair.

31:39.862 --> 31:40.978
No, it's not... it's not that.

31:41.032 --> 31:41.781
Okay.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.516
It's just that I've
watched you my whole life.

31:46.039 --> 31:48.156
And you've always
been so strong.

31:49.113 --> 31:50.993
Done exactly what you believe,

31:51.243 --> 31:53.657
and never cared about what
anyone else thought of you...

31:53.867 --> 31:56.381
Tell me about your life,
I know mine.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.767
Abuelita...

32:01.933 --> 32:03.921
I love girls

32:04.707 --> 32:07.158
the way that I'm supposed
to feel about boys.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.979
It's just something that's
always been inside of me,

32:11.063 --> 32:12.814
and I really want to
share it with you

32:12.898 --> 32:14.699
because I love you so much.

32:15.211 --> 32:16.812
I want you to know me.

32:16.896 --> 32:18.497
Who I really am.

32:19.233 --> 32:20.788
When I'm with Brittany...

32:21.676 --> 32:23.658
I finally understand what
people are talking about

32:23.742 --> 32:25.660
when they talk about love.

32:26.961 --> 32:28.450
I've tried so hard

32:28.485 --> 32:31.821
to push this feeling away,
and keep it locked inside...

32:32.494 --> 32:34.874
but every day just
feels like a war.

32:34.958 --> 32:38.026
I walk around so
mad at the world,

32:38.078 --> 32:40.079
but I'm really just
fighting with myself.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.446
I don't want to fight anymore.

32:45.593 --> 32:47.391
I'm just too tired.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.234
I have to just be me.

32:53.426 --> 32:54.777
Say something, please.

32:56.051 --> 32:58.397
Everyone has secrets, Santana.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.816
They're called secrets
for a reason.

33:01.739 --> 33:03.485
I want you to leave this house.

33:03.530 --> 33:05.765
I don't ever want
to see you again.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.744
- Abuela, you...
- Go.

33:08.790 --> 33:09.673
- You don't...
- Now.

33:09.741 --> 33:12.186
I'm the same person
I was a minute ago.

33:12.238 --> 33:13.605
You made your choice.

33:13.743 --> 33:15.377
Now I have made mine.

33:16.874 --> 33:18.284
But why?

33:19.132 --> 33:22.571
It's selfish of you
to make me uncomfortable.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.209
The sin isn't
in the thing,

33:27.260 --> 33:30.129
it's in the scandal,
when people talk about it aloud.

33:30.784 --> 33:32.204
So you're saying
it would've been better

33:32.241 --> 33:33.675
if I would've
kept this a secret?

33:40.205 --> 33:40.954
Abuela...

33:53.821 --> 33:55.271
I didn't bring protection.

33:55.322 --> 33:56.873
It's okay. I don't care.

33:58.483 --> 34:00.751
Under normal circumstances,
I'd take my chances,

34:00.819 --> 34:02.703
but we have a pretty
crappy track record.

34:02.788 --> 34:04.822
Maybe we'll get
lucky again.

34:04.873 --> 34:06.246
You mean unlucky.

34:07.230 --> 34:09.481
Look, trying to get Beth
back was a stupid idea.

34:09.806 --> 34:10.956
You're just figuring
this out now?

34:11.045 --> 34:12.163
But we made one
perfect baby.

34:12.214 --> 34:13.839
We can make another.

34:14.382 --> 34:16.350
We have
everything we need.

34:16.435 --> 34:17.668
Wait...

34:18.889 --> 34:20.550
Is this why you
invited me over?

34:21.273 --> 34:23.224
See, this is what happens
when you have anger sex.

34:23.308 --> 34:24.358
Why are you
angry at me?

34:24.443 --> 34:25.726
Fine! You don't want this?

34:25.811 --> 34:27.311
There's 20 other guys
at this school who would

34:27.362 --> 34:29.530
kill to give me what I want;
they would kill to love me.

34:30.029 --> 34:32.397
I'm not angry at you.
I let you down.

34:33.058 --> 34:34.158
We all did.

34:35.237 --> 34:36.237
You just spent a whole week

34:36.321 --> 34:37.264
helping Santana with a secret

34:37.284 --> 34:38.702
everybody already knows,
and not one person

34:38.781 --> 34:40.848
took ten seconds
to help you.

34:41.743 --> 34:43.027
And you're a frickin' mess.

34:44.362 --> 34:45.795
You have been for three years.

34:47.498 --> 34:49.101
Ever since I knocked you up.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.973
You don't need a baby
or a dude

34:56.041 --> 34:57.508
or anyone to make you special.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.011
If there's one person
that I'm sure

35:00.062 --> 35:03.116
is gonna get the hell out of this
town and make something of herself,

35:04.024 --> 35:05.164
it's you.

35:06.399 --> 35:07.730
Maybe I was just...

35:08.535 --> 35:11.704
getting all my crazy, bad
decisions out of the way early.

35:11.890 --> 35:14.025
I see you somewhere
warm and glamorous,

35:14.092 --> 35:18.045
like L.A. or Miami
or Toronto.

35:21.283 --> 35:22.713
Fine.

35:23.941 --> 35:25.670
But you have
to do something for me.

35:26.838 --> 35:27.955
You're staying here.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.791
You're gonna lie
with me and hold me.

35:32.111 --> 35:33.606
Okay.

35:34.512 --> 35:36.296
But no funny business.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.421
Who are you angry at?

35:44.756 --> 35:47.475
You know, the whole
"anger sex" thing.

35:51.898 --> 35:53.547
I need to tell you something.

35:54.564 --> 35:56.648
But you have to promise
to keep it a secret.

36:03.775 --> 36:04.870
How bad was it?

36:04.965 --> 36:06.394
Dukakis bad.

36:07.362 --> 36:09.830
Third place with 16%
of the vote.

36:09.897 --> 36:12.916
What does that mean for... us?

36:13.600 --> 36:16.036
Yeah, I have
the same question.

36:16.087 --> 36:17.788
Now that
the election's over,

36:17.809 --> 36:20.061
you two don't have to pretend
to be something you're not.

36:20.075 --> 36:21.705
- Now, Shannon...
- Cooter, have a seat

36:21.740 --> 36:23.168
on that Pilates ball
right over there.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.996
This is between me...

36:24.997 --> 36:26.965
and Brian Dennehy.

36:27.414 --> 36:29.498
I lost a lot in
the last 24 hours.

36:29.567 --> 36:32.269
Lost an election,
lost my reputation,

36:32.320 --> 36:34.655
I lost an enormous last-minute
bet I placed on myself

36:34.739 --> 36:37.489
with a very shady
bookie from Vegas.

36:37.574 --> 36:39.994
Cooter Mankins is the
best thing to happen to me

36:40.078 --> 36:43.831
since a sophomore named Becky
Jackson waddled into my life,

36:44.172 --> 36:47.391
and I will be damned
if I lose him, too.

36:49.438 --> 36:51.472
Shannon, I like you heaps.

36:52.104 --> 36:56.303
But I'd be lying if I told you
I didn't like Sue here, too.

36:58.123 --> 36:59.596
I don't know
what to say.

36:59.647 --> 37:01.315
I've had the same problem.

37:01.359 --> 37:03.420
I haven't known what
to say, either.

37:03.783 --> 37:05.635
But I feel like
I finally do.

37:06.411 --> 37:08.105
Cooter, I'm in love with you.

37:08.156 --> 37:10.741
And I'm sorry I haven't
told you till now,

37:10.808 --> 37:13.310
and I'm sorry I let
a tall, pretty blonde

37:13.361 --> 37:15.026
swoop in and snatch
you right away,

37:15.144 --> 37:16.401
but I'm telling you now,

37:16.433 --> 37:18.297
if I had to bench-press
a wildebeest

37:18.328 --> 37:20.150
just to prove to you
how much you mean to me,

37:20.201 --> 37:21.502
I would do it.

37:21.586 --> 37:24.488
I would do anything
to win you back, Coot.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.787
And I will not go down
without a fight.

37:33.181 --> 37:34.331
Okay, guys.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.799
Shelby and I just
wanted to say

37:35.850 --> 37:37.267
that you've really
inspired us.

37:37.335 --> 37:38.552
When we face off
at Sectionals,

37:38.636 --> 37:39.803
it will be with
more empathy,

37:39.854 --> 37:42.145
and a deeper understanding
of each other.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.307
- That's right.
- That's right!

37:47.529 --> 37:48.678
Where's Rachel?

37:48.730 --> 37:50.039
She never
misses applause.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.232
She's dealing with stuff.

37:52.625 --> 37:53.984
- Mr. Shue?
- Yeah.

37:54.980 --> 37:58.955
As the son of Ohio's
recently-minted Congressman...

37:59.148 --> 38:01.733
Yeah, Burt!

38:01.756 --> 38:04.581
and to dispel any lingering
clouds of suspicion,

38:04.667 --> 38:07.464
I would like to,
personally and publicly,

38:08.503 --> 38:11.176
congratulate President Brittany.

38:12.554 --> 38:15.255
The people have spoken,
and they want you, Brit.

38:15.847 --> 38:17.547
They want Pixy Stix.

38:18.709 --> 38:20.094
Rule wisely.

38:20.178 --> 38:21.762
Rule fabulously.

38:21.846 --> 38:23.263
That was the sweetest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

38:23.348 --> 38:24.714
Ooh!
Thank you, Kurt.

38:24.766 --> 38:27.050
You're still the most
unicorn of them all, so...

38:27.102 --> 38:28.885
Clap, clap, clap.

38:30.188 --> 38:32.239
Maybe I could put that
on my NYADA application.

38:32.323 --> 38:33.557
Don't give up hope, ever.

38:33.608 --> 38:34.775
We'll figure something out.

38:35.851 --> 38:37.191
Quinn, are you okay?

38:38.780 --> 38:40.447
Santana, will you
bring us home?

38:40.532 --> 38:42.583
- That's right!
- Thanks, Mr. Shue.

38:45.268 --> 38:48.471
So I picked a song that gives me
strength and gets me through.

38:48.596 --> 38:50.292
Same way all of you do.

38:50.839 --> 38:54.511
The struggle continues, but
at least I know I'm not alone.

39:10.228 --> 39:13.280
<i>Even</i>

39:13.364 --> 39:17.317
<i>Through the darkest phase</i>

39:17.402 --> 39:20.737
<i>Be it</i>

39:20.788 --> 39:24.291
<i>Thick or thin</i>

39:24.375 --> 39:28.128
<i>Always</i>

39:28.213 --> 39:32.282
<i>Someone marches brave</i>

39:32.333 --> 39:34.751
<i>Here beneath</i>

39:34.802 --> 39:39.840
<i>My skin</i>

39:39.924 --> 39:43.460
<i>And constant</i>

39:43.511 --> 39:46.930
<i>Craving</i>

39:46.981 --> 39:51.468
<i>Has always</i>

39:51.519 --> 39:53.303
<i>Been</i>

39:54.522 --> 39:57.858
<i>Maybe</i>

39:57.942 --> 40:01.945
<i>A great magnet pulls</i>

40:01.996 --> 40:04.981
<i>All souls</i>

40:05.033 --> 40:09.503
<i>Towards truth</i>

40:09.587 --> 40:12.656
<i>Or maybe</i>

40:12.707 --> 40:16.460
<i>It is life itself</i>

40:16.511 --> 40:20.330
<i>Leads wisdom</i>

40:20.381 --> 40:24.051
<i>To its youth</i>

40:24.135 --> 40:28.055
<i>Constant</i>

40:28.139 --> 40:31.675
<i>Craving</i>

40:31.726 --> 40:35.512
<i>Has always</i>

40:35.563 --> 40:37.481
<i>Been</i>

40:38.866 --> 40:42.786
<i>Craving...</i>

40:44.622 --> 40:47.658
<i>Ah-ha</i>

40:47.709 --> 40:51.912
<i>Constant craving</i>

40:51.996 --> 40:55.699
<i>Has al...</i>

40:55.750 --> 40:58.885

41:18.072 --> 41:19.556
<i>Ways been</i>

41:19.607 --> 41:25.395
<i>Has always been.</i>

41:31.938 --> 41:33.003
Rachel?

41:33.937 --> 41:35.905
I just, um,
told Principal Figgins

41:35.957 --> 41:38.508
that I rigged the election
so that Kurt would win.

41:39.139 --> 41:40.711
Kurt, please,
don't hate me.

41:40.762 --> 41:41.962
You're totally
in the clear.

41:42.046 --> 41:43.463
What did he say?

41:44.228 --> 41:46.249
He said
that he had no choice

41:46.301 --> 41:48.302
but to put it
on my permanent record,

41:48.386 --> 41:50.404
and that I'm suspended
for a week.

41:51.943 --> 41:56.179
Also he said that I was banned
from competing at Sectionals.
