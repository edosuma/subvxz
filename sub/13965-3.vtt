Alvis.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.673
Welcome to Spring Hill,
a little Company bio-dome

00:09.760 --> 00:11.671
I had set up
outside Old Town.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.377
Illenore Seyah Simms.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.754
It's an honor.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.386
She’s a guest of
The Company now.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.183
Ifyou need me,
we're there.

00:20.271 --> 00:22.512
Where are
your saviors now?

00:22.607 --> 00:23.767
No!

DUTCH: Turin,
what the hells
do you want?

00:34.785 --> 00:36.776
I want you to take some
unofficial assignments.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.036
Let's call 'em
"unsanctioned warrants".

00:39.123 --> 00:40.784
So, this is the deal.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.366
You use me, I use you.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.702
Because until we know
what Khlyen's endgame is,

00:45.796 --> 00:47.172
we're all being used.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.559
That's not the question,
little bird.

01:05.650 --> 01:08.016
The question is
why are you here?

01:09.070 --> 01:11.482
It's time for you to
come back to Arkyn.

01:11.572 --> 01:15.440
Is that what you wanted?
To shove a spike in my neck,

01:15.534 --> 01:17.399
and pump me
full ofgreen shit

01:17.495 --> 01:21.204
until I turn into a cold,
bloodless thing like you?

01:21.290 --> 01:24.703
Poor Yala, you really
don't remember, do you?

01:24.794 --> 01:26.000
Remember what?

01:26.087 --> 01:27.623
That it's already been done.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.795
You're a Six, Yala.
No!

DUTCH: Okay,
you've got us here.
What's the mission?

01:44.021 --> 01:47.309
About a week ago,
three of our own
got downed,

01:47.400 --> 01:49.186
north end of the Badlands,

01:49.819 --> 01:51.480
running ahead of
a Black Rain storm.

01:51.570 --> 01:52.605
JOHN: lt's Paulo.

01:52.697 --> 01:53.857
You know him?

01:53.948 --> 01:55.188
DUTCH: I've heard of him.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.656
Works with his wife,
Tanya?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.485
TURIN: They took on
her sister, Deena.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.659
Were they on a warrant?

02:02.456 --> 02:06.074
Level 2, salvage.
Everything else
about it is sealed.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.204
Northern Badlands,
that's just...
That's wasteland.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.502
There's nothing
out there to salvage.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.588
Gets weirder.
When the team
called in an evac,

02:12.675 --> 02:14.040
Khlyen intercepted
the message,

02:14.260 --> 02:15.375
covered it up.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.630
No rescue team was sent.

02:17.722 --> 02:19.713
I wanna know whether
our people are still alive.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.468
If they are,
bring them home.

02:21.559 --> 02:23.641
And find out what Khlyen
is trying to cover up.

02:23.853 --> 02:26.094
Coordinates are on there.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.314
Now, get the hell
out of here,

02:27.398 --> 02:29.138

ever saw this place.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.939

but they're not answering.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.222
There's nothing
showing on infrared.

03:11.317 --> 03:12.853
As far as I can see,
they're not in there.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.399
Yeah, but why would
they leave their ship?

03:14.487 --> 03:17.274
There's nothing
for 1,000 clicks
in any direction.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.775
And it'd been safer inside.

done with the place.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.093
Well, I'm gonna go out
on a limb here,
and say it's moss.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.592
In a ship?
In the desert?

03:47.686 --> 03:49.301

an evac a week ago.

stuff come from,
Johnny?

grow so fast?

what do you guys think,
that I'm a mossologist?

and controls are down.

for bedtime.

his stuff.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.350
If you really
want to piss him off,

06:01.445 --> 06:03.060
I could hire you.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.400
Is that an offer?

'Cause I could use

Wait, this isn't about what
happened under Spring Hill?

06:13.541 --> 06:16.032
Alvis, you can't be thinking
about leaving the Scarbacks.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.707
The faith has always been
everything to you.

06:17.795 --> 06:20.628
The faith almost turned me
into a mass murderer.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.088
That wasn't faith,
that was hate.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.915
Trust me, I'm familiar
with the difference.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.875
Really?

06:26.971 --> 06:29.804
What do you have
faith in? The Rack?

06:31.642 --> 06:34.349
I'm the wrong person
for you to talk to.

I don't know
what I believe in
right now.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.934
My knife.

06:48.409 --> 06:51.151
Maybe that makes you
the right person.

07:07.678 --> 07:11.170
So, Alvis?

07:11.265 --> 07:12.926
Yep.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.973
Any idea how long
he's gonna be with us?

07:16.312 --> 07:18.223
Just wondering if
we're gonna be setting up

07:18.314 --> 07:20.145
a confessional
in the mess area,
or anything.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.314
Don't want to see him
cutting himself

07:22.401 --> 07:24.016
before I've had
my morning coffee.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.102
We smuggled him
out of Old Town,

07:26.196 --> 07:29.438
so, until he finds
someplace else to go,
we're responsible for him.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.984
Ah! So, that's what
we're feeling.
Responsibility.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.780

So, you're here to
save us, or kill us?

You're Tanya, right?

07:45.674 --> 07:47.881
Maybe.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.422
Depends on who's asking.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.922
I'm Dutch.

And we're RAC Agents,

for evac.

07:56.769 --> 07:58.305
We sent that call
a week ago.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.511
What does the name
"Khlyen" mean to you?

08:03.651 --> 08:06.142
He's a RAC officer,
he's the one that
canceled your rescue.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.396
We want to know why.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.103
Tell me why
I should trust you.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.189
Because you were
doing yourjob.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.859
And the people
who were supposed
to be protecting you

08:14.953 --> 08:16.909
betrayed you.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.237
We've been there, too.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.757
We think you
stumbled over something
you shouldn't have seen.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.175
Are we right?

08:39.269 --> 08:42.887
If I tell you,
will you come down
with me to get Deena?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.102
Down where?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.769
Into the mine.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.813

What's all
the shiny shit?
Photonic crystals.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.297
They absorb the light.

ALVIS: You guys
have some nice toys.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.464
DUTCH:
Comes with the job.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.222
Like sexy jackets
and early death.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.098
Okay, we're here.
So, tell us what happened.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.641
What were you sent
to salvage?

09:25.733 --> 09:26.893
A monk.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.224
How do you salvage
a person?

09:28.318 --> 09:31.060
Didn't make any
sense to us, either,
but it's triple scale.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.942
I searched
The Company records
on the way here.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.988
There's nothing in 'em
about a mine in this area.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.941
The warrant came
with coordinates,
and they were right.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.992
You're here, aren't you?

09:40.789 --> 09:42.199
Hmmm! Touchy.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.415
Any thoughts on
the monk angle?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.618
All I can say is
that the faith
grew up in the mines.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.374
That's how I ended up
taking the robes.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.171
You were a miner?

09:51.341 --> 09:52.626
It's why he's with us,
D'av.

09:52.718 --> 09:57.007
Here I thought it was
Bring-a-Monk-to-Work Day.

09:57.723 --> 09:58.883
Is that my shirt?

10:00.476 --> 10:01.591
IS it?

10:01.685 --> 10:03.346
So, how did you guys
end up down here?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.143
We were out doing a recce
when the Black Rain started,

10:05.230 --> 10:06.265
so, we had no choice.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.563
Called in the evac,
and we went underground.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.641
Then our batteries
ran out.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.434
A few of the crystals
still had light.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.564
That's how we stayed safe.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.855
From what?
Paulo.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.274
D'AVIN:
Your husband?

10:18.452 --> 10:21.410
He's been trying to kill us.
Me and Deena.

10:21.497 --> 10:22.532
Kill you, why?

10:22.623 --> 10:25.285
I don't know.
Something happened
to him down here.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.286
The night
our lights when off,
he just snapped.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.913
He's still down here?
Is he armed?

10:30.130 --> 10:33.543
Come on. This way.

10:35.469 --> 10:39.508
Oh, good.
Wacko in the dark.
Love these missions.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.468
PAWTER: Dad,
you don't understand.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.642
Jelco shot Hillary Oonan
right in front of me,
and I can prove it.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.808
Whatever he's doing,
he's doing it under
orders from The Nine.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.480
Then I need to
talk to Mother.

one of The Nine Families.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.650
Please trust me.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.403
You're safer in
Spring Hill for now.

in every room
back home.

You get yours on
the black market?
(LAUGHS)

11:14.842 --> 11:18.255
I'm Qreshi, too.
Just not a Nine like you.

I don't see what's so
complicated about this.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.760
You just follow
the mine shaft.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.888
It's gonna split
in about 100 meters.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.470
This mine's at least
a century old.

tried to stay close
to the surface.

Yeah, he's right,
there's a three-way

12:19.448 --> 12:21.234
I'm not getting
any readings.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.691
It's probably why
Lucy didn't see
the mine in her scans.

sucking up all the EMR.

the part where I’m surrounded
by man-eating moss.

How long will it take you
to clear the rockslide?

23:07.971 --> 23:09.461

the bugs are the reason
they shut down the mine.

Maybe.

What does any of this
have to do with Khlyen?

23:43.423 --> 23:45.288
it looks like
an angry vagina.

aren't moss,
they're centipedes.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.296

Well, they must use

23:53.391 --> 23:55.882
If they move together,
they must have
some sort of hive mind.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.516
But it's notjust that,
they're...
Well, they're smart.

ground that ship?

24:03.026 --> 24:04.106
JOHN: Maybe.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.320
But they're definitely
smart enough to
corral Tanya into that pit.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.814
That must be
the way that they hunt.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.859
Yeah, but she was
running from Paulo.
Wasn't she?

24:11.200 --> 24:14.363
I don't think so.
How many skeletons
were down there with her?

24:14.662 --> 24:18.325
Two. So, Paulo and
Deena were already dead.

24:18.416 --> 24:21.123
She was, what,
hallucinating?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.701

there was no blood
after she shot Paulo.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.081

And maybe a bunch
of man-eating

You think that this
has something to do

with the plasma
that I took out of
Khlyen's biocomputer?

27:04.916 --> 27:07.623

they tried to
put in me on Arkyn.

slow down, not all
that's green
is space goo.

27:12.089 --> 27:15.422
Makes sense, though.
Might be why Khlyen
canceled the evac order.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.967
This could be
what he doesn't
want anyone to find.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.169
Maybe that’s what
drew the monks here.

with Khlyen and the Sixes.

people down here to
milk the mossipedes?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.854
She's my ship.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.493
Have you seen
my guard anywhere?

34:41.580 --> 34:42.911
He wasn't there
when Iwoke up.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.659
I think he went home sick.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.411
Well, you can play it
as tough as you want,

34:47.503 --> 34:49.835
but I still know
your weakness.

34:51.548 --> 34:54.335
You're too much a doctor
to kill someone you hate.

34:54.510 --> 34:57.252
(LAUGHS)
For now.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.882
We're not so different,
you and me.
(BEEPING)

34:58.973 --> 35:00.964
We're both outcasts,
both sent into exile

35:01.058 --> 35:03.424
by families that
didn't want us.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.390
We could get back at them.

35:07.481 --> 35:08.721
Together.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.398
This isjust the beginning.

35:12.486 --> 35:14.022
Actually,
I think this is the end.

35:15.656 --> 35:17.362
You're not gonna
kill yourself.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.111
Oh, no, that's not me.
That's you.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.817
I used your DNA
to unlock the bracelet,

35:21.912 --> 35:24.369
and reinstalled it
around your heart.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.825
I don't want to
kill you, Jelco.

35:25.916 --> 35:28.908
You're just a symptom.
And I have to
treat the disease.

35:29.336 --> 35:30.416
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

35:30.504 --> 35:33.496
Oh, oh, Iwouldn't
push that too far.
(G ROANS)

35:33.841 --> 35:35.706
Or the little prick
goes boom.

35:37.386 --> 35:38.546
(YELLS)

35:39.179 --> 35:40.555
(GROANING)

35:40.639 --> 35:43.506
Guard! Guard!

35:51.400 --> 35:52.435
Johnny?
JOHN: Pawter.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.733
Hi. Are you on your way?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.276
I’m heading in now.

35:56.363 --> 35:57.864
Great. I'm...

35:57.948 --> 35:59.063
(RADIO STATIC)

35:59.783 --> 36:03.742
Johnny? Are you there?
I'm getting static.
Johnny?

36:04.246 --> 36:05.406
(PAWTER GRUNTS)

36:18.594 --> 36:19.754
(EXHALES)

36:24.308 --> 36:25.388
Hey.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.386
When we were
under Spring Hill,

36:30.481 --> 36:33.314
I never did thank you
for killing me.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.640
I needed that.

36:35.277 --> 36:38.269
Yeah. You did.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.647
(DOOR HISSES)

36:42.242 --> 36:43.527
(SIGHS)

36:50.250 --> 36:52.832
How you doing?
Neverbeﬂer

36:55.297 --> 36:59.165
Okay, now,
without the bullshit.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.091
(SIGHS)

37:08.143 --> 37:11.226
You do this to take away
other people's sins.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.809
Does it work on yours?

37:14.983 --> 37:19.397
Thanks to you,
I didn't kill all those
people in Spring Hill.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.399
But I did kill a guard
to escape from prison.

37:22.658 --> 37:25.775
I need to bleed for that.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.863
Now I think it's time
I stopped running away
from what I really am.

37:29.957 --> 37:33.074
Which is?
A weapon.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.908
It's what he made me.
I might as well use it.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.163
No.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.120
Your sins
can be forgiven.

37:38.507 --> 37:42.716
Thanks, but you're
just not dressed for
absolution anymore.

37:42.845 --> 37:43.834
Hmm.

37:47.641 --> 37:49.302
When I saw that temple,

37:51.019 --> 37:53.271
I started to wonder
if there's a reason
you brought me here,

37:53.355 --> 37:56.722
a reason
that I went down
into those mines.

38:00.529 --> 38:01.814
Now, I know there was.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.403
Where did you get this?

38:03.657 --> 38:06.239
I found a body
down there, a monk.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.443
The salvage warrant.

38:10.205 --> 38:13.697
ALVIS: He cutoff
his own skin to leave
a message behind.

38:14.710 --> 38:19.329
DUTCH: This is his skin?
Do you know what it says?

38:19.423 --> 38:20.663
ALVIS: Yeah, here.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.501
(GASPS)

38:26.555 --> 38:29.513
It's all in the old tongue.
One of our oldest prayers.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.222
I know the part on my back.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.801
Twelve went to fight
the Devil in Arkyn,
but...

38:38.567 --> 38:41.058
Here, one came back.

38:42.196 --> 38:43.481
One came back, I...

38:43.572 --> 38:44.732
I think he was
one of the monks

38:44.823 --> 38:47.360
that went to fight
the Devil on Arkyn.

38:47.451 --> 38:48.907
D'avin saw that
when he was there.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.615
He said it was
someone’s memory.

38:55.959 --> 39:00.419
Your monks,
green liquid, Khlyen,

39:01.548 --> 39:03.163
what’s the connection?

39:15.646 --> 39:17.307
ALVIS: I’m gonna
jump ship on Leith.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.896
There's a monastery there
with some of
the original scriptures.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.064
Maybe I'll get answers
for both of us.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.495
LUCY: Dutch.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.864
Yes, Lucy?

39:33.956 --> 39:37.323
I’ve analyzed the microwave
radiation bursts from Arkyn.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.883
(GROANS) What the hells?

39:47.970 --> 39:49.801
This is where I come
to get away from you people.

39:49.930 --> 39:54.720
You didn't mention that
massive data transmission
Arkyn sent

39:55.811 --> 39:57.722
just before they
blew up the base.

39:57.813 --> 39:59.394
The piece I grabbed
was encrypted,

39:59.481 --> 40:01.142
uncrackable,
no point in telling you.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.147
And you didn't tell me
where it went.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.900
Because I don't know.
And that's not how
this arrangement works.

40:06.113 --> 40:08.479
Find out where it went.
Write me a warrant
to get there.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.155
I need to know
what's in that file.

40:10.284 --> 40:11.569
So, I'm your typist now?

40:14.037 --> 40:15.652
You know,
I've been thinking about

40:15.831 --> 40:20.871
how long people have been
making decisions for me,
pulling on my strings.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.497
This epiphany have
a foreseeable conclusion?

40:24.756 --> 40:29.546
I'm tired of other people's
decisions ruling my life.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.672
And I'm done taking orders.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.976
Here's the arrangement.

40:40.063 --> 40:43.772
You want my help
figuring out what's really
going on in The Rack,

40:43.859 --> 40:46.896
we do it my way.

40:46.987 --> 40:48.523
Illbeintouch.

40:48.614 --> 40:50.650
