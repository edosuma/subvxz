00:02.035 --> 00:05.801
<i>Tonight, an</i> Arrested Development
<i>you can't miss.</i>

00:05.905 --> 00:07.839
<i>A cavalcade of stars.</i>

00:07.941 --> 00:12.173
<i>The shocking final moments
will be presented live.</i>

00:12.278 --> 00:14.405
<i>And one of these people...</i>

00:16.816 --> 00:18.784
<i>will die.</i>

00:20.720 --> 00:23.280
<i>- The Bluths were desperate.</i>
- I assume you've seen this.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.483
<i>The press had them
all but finished.</i>

00:25.592 --> 00:28.789
<i>- What? What is it?</i>
- This isn't gonna work over the phone, Dad.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.022
Then get Bob Loblaw to hire me
another surrogate.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.759
That's kind of the point.
Mr. Loblaw no longer works for us...

00:33.867 --> 00:36.131
because someone wanted a boyfriend.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.568
- Well, don't blame me.
- I was talking to Lindsay, actually.

00:38.671 --> 00:41.265
But he was clearly turned off
to the both of you.

00:41.374 --> 00:46.903
Now, we're gonna need a new lawyer. And that
is going to mean about a $100,000 retainer.

00:47.013 --> 00:50.540
If we want a chance of keeping this family
going past the next few weeks...

00:50.650 --> 00:53.084
we're gonna have to pull out
all the stops.

00:53.186 --> 00:57.555
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about all of you getting jobs.

00:57.657 --> 00:59.921
The best place to look for a job...

01:00.026 --> 01:02.256
Who threw the tomato?

01:02.362 --> 01:04.421
<i>How the hell are we gonna
get a hundred grand?</i>

01:04.531 --> 01:06.556
I know this isn't exactly
what you're looking for...

01:06.666 --> 01:09.294
but Maeby was just accepted
into private school.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.394
- I've sent the check in already.
- No, that's not what I'm lookin' for at all.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.632
Michael, it's the most
prestigious private school in town.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.572
Oh, no. Not the Milford Academy.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.509
<i>Children were neither to be seen nor heard...</i>

01:19.612 --> 01:21.671
<i>at the school Buster had attended.</i>

01:21.781 --> 01:25.080
It's the exact opposite.
It's called "Openings."

01:25.185 --> 01:28.643
Oh, great. That sounds like another one
of those gradeless, structureless...

01:28.755 --> 01:30.655
New Age "feel-gooderies."

01:30.757 --> 01:34.454
They teach self-expression and getting
in touch with feelings, Michael.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.530
- I mean, I know you don't have any.
- The boy who couldn't cry.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.530
He's a robot!

01:39.632 --> 01:42.066
Oh, Michael can cry.
He just doesn't wanna rust.

01:42.168 --> 01:45.001
Yes, he's like the Steel Man
from <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

01:45.105 --> 01:47.164
- Tin Man?
- Is that what he's called?

01:47.273 --> 01:50.470
- He knows. - Since you sent the check,
this is how you're gonna pay for it.

01:50.577 --> 01:53.944
You're gonna be in charge of the house.
Cooking, cleaning, all of it.

01:54.047 --> 01:57.483
You're going to put Lindsay in charge
of the cooking? At least you'll lose weight.

01:57.584 --> 02:01.350
You know, Mom, I think the only time you ever
cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.513
You gave us cereal in an ashtray.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.818
Gob, pal? How about you?
Can you find some work?

02:05.925 --> 02:07.893
Oh, sure, Michael.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.053
As what? A waiter?

02:10.163 --> 02:12.188
Can I get you something, madam?

02:15.735 --> 02:17.965
- I will have a vodka, though.
- What? Oh.

02:18.071 --> 02:22.064
If you'd ever accidentally worked a day in your life,
you'd know there's no indignity in it.

02:22.175 --> 02:23.642
Great. She'll have a vodka.

02:23.743 --> 02:27.235
<i>Instead of selling out,
becoming housewives and waiters...</i>

02:27.347 --> 02:28.644
<i>why don't we have a big event?</i>

02:28.748 --> 02:31.979
Some sort of “Save Our Bluths" type thing.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.655
<i>We'll throw a legal defense fund dinner.
Ask for donations.</i>

02:36.756 --> 02:39.657
As long as we don't look desperate.

02:39.759 --> 02:42.421
We want 'em to think we'll take their help,
but don't need it.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.429
I should be seen a lot at the club.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.398
Yeah, our backs are against the wall,
and it's just hard to accept...

02:47.500 --> 02:49.400
that it's really come to begging.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.027
<i>Sometimes it's the only way to stay in the game.</i>

02:52.138 --> 02:54.436
<i>Please tell your friends about this show.</i>

03:02.315 --> 03:06.274
<i>Michael had asked Lindsay
to take care of the house.</i>

03:06.386 --> 03:09.378
<i>- And to his surprise, she was sort of doing it.</i>
- You're sort of doing it.

03:09.489 --> 03:13.357
Yeah, check it out. I found that
canned ham that we'd had forever...

03:13.459 --> 03:15.620
and I put it in a pot of boiling water.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.423
- And guess what I'm calling it?
- Soup?

03:17.530 --> 03:21.364
Hot ham water. You know,
I'm actually a really good mom.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.526
I think it's 'cause
Maeby's never around.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.968
You should send George Michael
to Openings too.

03:26.072 --> 03:28.040
Yes, it could help him
express his feelings.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.473
My son expresses himself just fine.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.137
- Isn't that right, Son?
- What? Yeah, it's fine.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.373
Yeah, I guess.
I don't care. Stop.

03:35.481 --> 03:38.143
Yes. He's a regular
Freddy Wilson, that one.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.049
- I don't know that reference.
- No, I don't either.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.055
Oh, I don't know either.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.058
<i>- It's this guy.</i>
- My son's fine where he is.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.720
He's got the S.A.T.'s coming up.
You gotta do well. You studying?

03:49.829 --> 03:52.627
Yeah, I'm taking a three real quick
so I can get a cream soda.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.428
- Oh, I'll get that for you.
- No, I will get it. I have to get it myself.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.265
Just relax.

03:58.371 --> 04:01.135
Just check the stove real quick.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.404
You know, Michael, if I may
take off my acting pants for a moment...

04:04.510 --> 04:07.172
and pull my "analrapist" stocking
over my head...

04:07.280 --> 04:10.647
George Michael has been
acting strange lately.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.421
He may have developed
what we in the soft sciences...

04:20.526 --> 04:22.756
refer to as obsessive-compulsive disorder...

04:22.862 --> 04:25.797
- or the OC Disorder.
- Don't call it that.

04:25.898 --> 04:29.595
I think ultimately it's because
he's afraid to express himself.

04:29.702 --> 04:34.139
<i>Actually, he was afraid his Aunt Lindsay
was going to burn the house down.</i>

04:34.240 --> 04:37.107
Hi. How are you?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.472
Cream soda.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.051
Maybe he does need this school.
Did you see this letter?

04:46.152 --> 04:47.710
You know, it's done wonders for Maeby.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.220
- "Maeby is an exceptional young lady."
- Exceptional.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.450
"We are sure that she is
destined for great things."

04:52.558 --> 04:56.119
- Great things.
- "And we wish her luck in all her"...

04:57.964 --> 05:00.626
It says "over." I'd probably have
to crack this open to be sure...

05:00.733 --> 05:02.633
but this sounds like
an expulsion letter.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.635
"She's never been to class."

05:04.737 --> 05:06.898
What boarding school would
lose track of its students?

05:07.006 --> 05:10.134
- Openings is not a boarding school.
- I thought it was a boarding school.

05:10.243 --> 05:14.236
<i>Actually, Maeby had been on
the set of a film called</i> Snowboarding School 2...

05:14.347 --> 05:16.975
<i>in her secret life
as a film executive.</i>

05:17.083 --> 05:19.415
There goes that nonrefundable tuition.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.419
It is the one rule they do have there.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.421
She should be punished for this.

05:23.523 --> 05:27.186
Tobias, if I can become a more traditional mother,
then maybe you could start being more of...

05:27.293 --> 05:29.488
Nontraditional mother.
Yes, you're right.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.495
After all, I am her father.

05:31.597 --> 05:34.065
The cars are still off,
and I rewashed all the clothes.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.158
<i>And that's when Michael decided...</i>

05:36.269 --> 05:40.000
<i>that perhaps Maeby's tuition
didn't have to go to waste after all.</i>

05:40.106 --> 05:42.336
<i>Meanwhile, Lucille went to work...</i>

05:42.442 --> 05:45.673
<i>- soliciting for the Bluth fund-raiser.</i>
- We have plenty of money.

05:45.778 --> 05:50.477
Don't get me wrong. But we can't use
our personal assets to defend the company.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.677
<i>Just then,
Gob arrived and decided to have a laugh.</i>

05:53.786 --> 05:56.778
Your drink, madam.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.823
- Can I get you anything...
- Get that one out of here.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.825
As you please.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.521
<i>But Lucille had never
made eye contact with a waiter.</i>

06:03.629 --> 06:06.427
- Can you drop these off at two?
- Why not?

06:06.532 --> 06:09.399
I'm just a waiter.

06:09.502 --> 06:12.767
<i>- So he kept it up.</i>
- We're all out of the halibut.

06:12.872 --> 06:17.241
<i>The joke was over,
but the lunch rush was just beginning.</i>

06:17.343 --> 06:19.402
- Hey, new guy. You wanna seat table four?
- Oh, yeah.

06:19.512 --> 06:23.039
<i>Back at the penthouse,
however, lunch was long overdue.</i>

06:23.149 --> 06:25.709
I don't suppose she left
anything for me to eat.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.719
No, just a soup and a half sandwich
and a whole sandwich for me.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.482
- Ah.
- Hello. Hey.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.490
So what's going on
with the fund-raiser?

06:32.592 --> 06:36.494
Well, uh, I don't think the Home Builder's
Organization is gonna be supporting us.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.064
Yeah, the HBO is not gonna want us.
What do we do now?

06:39.165 --> 06:42.623
Well, I think it's showtime. I think
we have to have a show during dinner.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.930
Hey, we could have some celebrities in.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.437
You know, Oscar winners
like, uh, Nicole Kidman.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.440
I don't wanna round up
a bunch of famous people...

06:49.542 --> 06:51.510
that have nothing to do
with our family as some stunt.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.910
- What's that got to do with us?
- Nothing. You're gonna write a speech about me...

06:55.014 --> 06:56.914
so they can see how wonderful I am.

06:57.016 --> 06:59.007
I think we got a better
chance at Nicole Kidman.

06:59.118 --> 07:01.746
- Oh? Huh?
- Actually, I may have an in with Andy Richter.

07:01.854 --> 07:05.255
Well, do you think you can get him?
I'm kidding. Of course not him.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.293
His brother does teach
George Michael at Openings.

07:08.394 --> 07:11.693
George Michael is going to
that New Age feel-gooderie?

07:11.798 --> 07:14.596
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're gonna poison him against you.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.191
Remember what happened
when we sent Lindsay to that kind of school?

07:17.303 --> 07:20.101
All of a sudden I was
the-the bad guy to her.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.573
And you don't respect Mom,
and you don't respect women.

07:24.977 --> 07:27.775
- Are you married?
- Damn school.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.611
I said to the teacher...
I said, "You poison her, I'll poison you."

07:31.717 --> 07:34.117
<i>George Sr. did more than just say it.</i>

07:34.220 --> 07:37.018
<i>He sent the man a basket
of poison muffins.</i>

07:37.123 --> 07:41.025
Do you know the Muffin Man?
There's a reward if you do.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.095
Then, would you like some foam
in your coffee?

07:43.196 --> 07:47.496
It's called a "cuppuccino,"
and wait till you see what it costs.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.330
You can say what you want
about the Milford Academy.

07:50.436 --> 07:54.167
The kids who came out of there,
prepared for life.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.968
Does anyone know how
to eat one of these?

07:56.075 --> 07:57.975
You know, George Michael's
gonna be fine, okay?

07:58.077 --> 08:00.910
I just want him to know how to express himself.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.811
<i>He was actually
having trouble expressing himself.</i>

08:03.916 --> 08:05.816
Why don't you tell the group
about yourself?

08:05.918 --> 08:08.512
My name is George Michael Bluth.

08:08.621 --> 08:11.089
I am a 16-year-old Caucasian male.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.522
My mom died.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.356
And I-I guess that's it.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.862
Hardly. See, if it were me, I would say...

08:18.965 --> 08:23.299
"I'm Donnie Richter. I have a brother named Andy.
He's an attention hog.

08:23.402 --> 08:27.896
He can't seem to really attract a real audience,
but I love the fat SOB anyway."

08:28.007 --> 08:30.840
I thought you looked like Andy Richter.
You guys are identical twins?

08:30.943 --> 08:32.842
Identical quintuplets, actually.

08:32.945 --> 08:36.278
<i>There was Andy the show-off,
Donnie the sensitive one...</i>

08:36.381 --> 08:40.511
<i>Chareth the flirt,
Rocky the risk-taker and Andy's stunt double...</i>

08:40.620 --> 08:43.714
<i>and Emmett who asked that
we not show his picture...</i>

08:43.823 --> 08:47.554
<i>although composite photography tells us
he'd look something like this.</i>

08:47.660 --> 08:50.128
<i>Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to go home tonight...</i>

08:50.229 --> 08:52.697
and write something about
how you really feel.

08:52.798 --> 08:55.892
Something critical. Bring it in tomorrow
and read it for the group.

08:56.002 --> 09:00.063
- Um, will this go toward my grade?
- Oh, we don't have grades here.

09:00.172 --> 09:05.041
A student either learns and gets an "L,"
or they fluctuate in their learning.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.442
- And what do we get for that?
- An "F."

09:07.547 --> 09:09.538
<i>- Maeby, meanwhile...</i>

09:09.649 --> 09:11.640
<i>- was about to have a learning experience.</i>
- Well.

09:11.751 --> 09:15.414
I understand you've been having trouble
with that expensive boarding school.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.421
That's right. I can read.

09:17.523 --> 09:19.548
Okay, first of all,
<i>Variety</i> got it wrong, all right?

09:19.659 --> 09:21.889
We didn't want this project.
It was a co-finance with Miramax.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.121
Poof, Miramax is gone.
We're still on the hook.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.130
It turns out Jamie Kennedy
can't even snowboard.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.326
All right, I'll listen to this later.

09:29.435 --> 09:33.804
Don't tell me where you've been.
It'll just make me worry more. But guess what.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.898
There's a new daddy in town.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.909
A discipline daddy.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.338
Oh, it's, uh... It's a parenting tape.

09:43.449 --> 09:46.577
If you wanna skip school, that's fine.
You'll just come to work with me.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.586
But you don't have a job.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.156
All right. Here.
Tell you what we're gonna do.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.784
We are going to stuff each one
of these gift bags with...

09:54.894 --> 09:59.763
a head shot, some glitter
and a decorative hand soap.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.425
And we're gonna send 'em to
every casting director in town.

10:02.535 --> 10:06.437
- And don't forget the funny notes.
- "I know where you live. Ha, ha"?

10:06.539 --> 10:09.702
- Casting directors hate this.
<i>- They really do.</i>

10:09.809 --> 10:11.868
The glitter queen struck again.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.640
Never hire Tobias Fünke.

10:14.747 --> 10:18.148
<i>And back at the country club,
something unusual had happened.</i>

10:18.250 --> 10:22.710
Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale. Unless,
did you expect me to follow you to your car?

10:22.822 --> 10:25.017
- They're your tips.
- Tips.

10:25.124 --> 10:30.391
<i>And Gob realized
he'd accidentally worked a day in his life.</i>

10:30.496 --> 10:32.396
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,
was being a mother...</i>

10:32.498 --> 10:34.557
<i>- when someone showed up who needed one.</i>
- Hey, sister.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.760
- How'd you get here?
- I walked.

10:36.869 --> 10:39.633
I tried hitchhiking,
but it's hard to do without a thumb.

10:39.739 --> 10:43.835
- I'm so hungry.
- Would you like to try some of this?

10:43.943 --> 10:46.309
Mmm.

10:46.412 --> 10:50.143
So watery, and yet there's
a smack of ham to it.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.308
It's hot ham water.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.751
- Yeah. <i>- Upstairs, George Michael
was struggling with his assignment.</i>

10:55.855 --> 10:59.814
- Can you think of anything critical
to say about my dad? - Are you serious?

10:59.925 --> 11:03.224
I have glitter in my lungs from
making goody bags for casting directors.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.320
And he's given me a hundred more
to do for homework.

11:05.431 --> 11:09.026
It's, like, " I don't do my homework.
George Michael does my homework."

11:09.135 --> 11:12.036
<i>And that's when he decided
it was time to cheat off of her.</i>

11:12.138 --> 11:14.038
It might help if
you expressed yourself.

11:14.140 --> 11:19.043
<i>It also gave him an opportunity
to smell her neck.</i>

11:19.145 --> 11:21.045
<i>And the next day,
Michael drove to Openings...</i>

11:21.147 --> 11:24.173
<i>in the hopes of recruiting
Donnie's brother for the fund-raiser...</i>

11:24.283 --> 11:27.775
<i>when he noticed his son
expressing himself rather well.</i>

11:27.887 --> 11:31.983
He pretends he's the great father all of a sudden
and acts like he's all worried about me.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.788
But it turns out he just does it
so I can help him with his joke of a career.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.022
No wonder Mom
wanted out so bad.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.065
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

11:41.167 --> 11:45.536
<i>Gob, meanwhile, was several days
in to being an accidental waiter.</i>

11:45.638 --> 11:48.937
<i>And he discovered that
a little flirting helped bring in the tips.</i>

11:49.041 --> 11:52.704
If you didn't have adult-onset diabetes,
I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar.

11:52.812 --> 11:57.875
Oh, Gob. You could charm
the black off a telegram boy.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.543
<i>Okay, we'll just tell you now.
She's the one who dies.</i>

12:00.653 --> 12:03.383
His name is Andy something.

12:03.489 --> 12:06.890
I think he's Ed McMahon's kid.
A song and dance man.

12:06.992 --> 12:09.228
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was there soliciting for the fund-raiser...</i>

12:09.228 --> 12:10.422
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was there soliciting for the fund-raiser...</i>

12:10.529 --> 12:13.726
<i>- but still hadn't noticed him.</i>
- We'll have the lobster tail.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.165
<i>- Until this happened.</i>
- And maybe later you can...

12:16.268 --> 12:19.396
save a little piece of tail for me.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.405
Come on!

12:21.507 --> 12:25.443
<i>I hope that isn't the sort of humor
Andy McMahon will be doing.</i>

12:25.544 --> 12:27.569
Lobster, Mom?

12:27.680 --> 12:29.739
<i>- And Michael went to confront Donnie.</i>
- Hey!

12:29.849 --> 12:32.818
<i>Nice haircut and thanks
for turning my son against me.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:35.011
Oh, oh. No, no. I-I'm Andy.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.521
Oh. Sorry.

12:37.623 --> 12:40.751
Oh, hey. How would you feel about
coming to a fund-raiser at our house?

12:40.860 --> 12:43.420
- How much does it pay?
- It's just a free dinner, but...

12:43.529 --> 12:45.429
- I'll be there.
- Great.

12:45.531 --> 12:48.932
- I'll be in the cafeteria.
- Oh, he's such a pig.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.195
You should know about
bad-mouthing family members.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.203
I heard what you had
my son say out there.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.273
He chose what to say.

12:55.374 --> 12:58.138
- Maybe we should include him in this.
- No need.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.441
You're the one that poisoned him against me.
How would you like that done to you?

13:01.547 --> 13:04.038
Are you threatening to poison me?

13:04.150 --> 13:08.177
I'm just expressing myself, man.

13:09.822 --> 13:13.280
- What did I tell you?
- How dare that Donnie Richter.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.986
Yeah, you gotta take care
of that guy, or I will.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.620
- Yeah, yeah. Let me.
- This is not your business. No.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.631
I'm just gonna pull him
out of that school.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.725
You're damn right, you are.
We can't have this happen. Not now.

13:23.836 --> 13:26.532
This family has got to stick together.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.539
I don't want Gob coming to this dinner.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.201
- Good idea.
- Guess where he's been getting his money.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.244
Is he following people
to their cars again?

13:33.345 --> 13:35.836
He's a waiter!

13:35.948 --> 13:38.143
- He is? Well, that's great.
- No, it's not great.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.343
Am I the only one that
thinks this family...

13:40.452 --> 13:42.443
is finally starting to become
sympathetic and relatable?

13:42.555 --> 13:45.456
That's what people wanna see, you know.
Lindsay's taking care of the house.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.822
Oh, I forgot about that.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.919
Tell the "housewife"
she's not coming either.

13:51.030 --> 13:54.158
If you don't want her, you don't want me either.
She's taking care of me.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.099
She glued my thumb back on.

13:57.203 --> 14:00.661
Sister's my new mother, Mother.
And is it just me, or is she looking hotter too?

14:00.773 --> 14:03.003
- Why don't you marry her?
- Maybe I will!

14:03.108 --> 14:05.770
We're veering away
from relatability again.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.745
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was
getting tired of being with her father.</i>

14:08.848 --> 14:11.612
Now what we do is we paint our lips
Joan Crawford red...

14:11.717 --> 14:15.676
pop on a little blue eyeliner and then
plant a lipstick kiss on every one of 'em.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.383
- Why the blue eyeliner? - Well, she felt
that her eyes were too close together.

14:19.491 --> 14:22.187
Hello? Uh, yeah, uh...

14:22.294 --> 14:25.786
It's a casting director.
Yes, he is available.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.959
Uh, let me put my, uh...
our, uh, assistant on the phone with you.

14:30.069 --> 14:33.470
Thank you, yes. I better get changed.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.597
Thanks, Deb. Yeah.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.869
So, he's Torture Victim
Number Four, right?

14:37.977 --> 14:40.377
No, that's great.
Yeah, he's really into discipline.

14:40.479 --> 14:43.141
<i>And George Michael
was about to get some discipline too.</i>

14:43.249 --> 14:45.149
You are no longer
going to that school.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.448
I don't wanna get into a big discussion about it.
It's just not right for you.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.318
Is this because I cheated off Maeby?
I've never done that before. I swear.

14:51.423 --> 14:54.620
I couldn't think of anything about you,
so I asked her to write it about her dad.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.992
- You cheated?
- Yeah, it was stupid of me.

14:58.097 --> 15:02.227
Now Donnie's met you. He's never gonna
believe you were up for a part in <i>Wicked.</i>

15:02.334 --> 15:06.293
You do what you have to. You think I want to give
that speech about Dad at the fund-raiser?

15:06.405 --> 15:10.842
Sometimes you say you hate your dad to get
a good grade or you like him to make some money.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.605
Sounds like you're doing a great job there.
We're keeping you in.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.907
- No...
- I don't wanna have a whole discussion about it.

15:16.015 --> 15:20.748
Donnie. Well, I guess
I owe you an apology.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.413
No.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.753
- It's Andy again, isn't it?
- Rocky. Andy's the pig.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.327
- Well, you're not exactly...
- I'm his stunt double.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.919
You think I like this?
I disgust myself.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.760
Let go of my dad.
You're gonna hurt him.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.927
Oh, no. I'm only making it look like that.
He's totally in charge of the situation.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.441
So what is the problem?

15:44.543 --> 15:48.604
Somebody sent my brother Donnie
a basket of poison muffins.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.773
It could've been the Muffin Man.
They never caught him.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.717
- How do you know about that?
- I saw it on <i>Why We Were Scared of the '70s.</i>

15:54.820 --> 15:57.550
And what ever happened to the Muffin Man?
Remember him?

15:57.656 --> 16:00.284
I always pictured a giant six-foot muffin...

16:00.392 --> 16:02.292
trying to eat me while I was eatin' him.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.794
It's kind of a fantasy
I go to a lot now.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.798
And he says <i>you</i> threatened to poison him.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.800
I was upset.

16:09.902 --> 16:13.531
I'd just heard that my son thought I was
a horrible father. But, no, I didn't poison him.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.573
Well, if I find out you did...

16:16.909 --> 16:19.377
Oh, uh, Andy wants to know,
at this dinner...

16:19.478 --> 16:22.311
- you want him to sing or anything?
- A song would be fantastic.

16:23.849 --> 16:27.216
You saw? I thought you didn't know
what I said about you.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.219
Well, that wasn't exactly the truth.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.846
But don't worry. I know you don't
have anything bad to say about me.

16:31.957 --> 16:35.518
No. You know what? I think Donnie was right.
I just wasn't digging deep enough.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.993
I think I might've meant what I said.
You never listen to me.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.430
You didn't ask me if I wanted to go to this school.
You didn't ask about what I said.

16:41.533 --> 16:44.593
You threatened my teacher.
You don't respect me.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.830
How can I respect you, man?

16:46.939 --> 16:49.203
<i>It was a complex situation...</i>

16:49.308 --> 16:51.208
<i>without an easy solution.</i>

16:51.310 --> 16:54.677
- Hello?
- The caterers didn't show up. I used the club.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.681
They said we owe them too much money.
I guess all those lunches.

16:57.783 --> 17:03.346
I've got 50 people coming in three hours
and nothing to feed them, no one to serve it.

17:03.455 --> 17:06.856
We have to make a good impression,
or we're finished.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.928
<i>Now that's a clear-cut situation
with the promise of comedy.</i>

17:10.029 --> 17:12.520
<i>Tell your friends.</i>

17:15.634 --> 17:19.627
<i>The Save Our Bluths party
was starting to heat up.</i>

17:25.077 --> 17:28.569
<i>But the same could not be said
for Lindsay's chicken.</i>

17:28.680 --> 17:30.614
What is going on?
They're getting restless.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.616
I can't offer to !@%$ them
in front of their husbands.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.879
This is what you're making?
Poached salmonella?

17:34.987 --> 17:37.455
It'll be fine.
I'll just put the sauce on them.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.456
What kind of sauce is that?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.458
Wait. This is the water
I thawed the chicken in.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.391
Oh. Well, that should go with chicken.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.089
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.098
<i>And some powerful players showed up.</i>

17:48.200 --> 17:50.259
George, Bill Kincade
from Fostco Industries.

17:50.369 --> 17:53.896
<i>- Sort of.</i> - Hope you don't mind.
I sent one of those stupid surrogates.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.668
- You got busted too?
- No, I had a prior engagement.

17:56.775 --> 18:00.939
- I'm at the Fire and Ice Ball.
- Coming through. Chicken in chicken sauce.

18:01.046 --> 18:02.946
Thank you very much for showing up.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.278
Maybe you could sing while
they're bringing out dinners.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.619
Uh, I'm not Andy. I'm Emmett.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.246
Uh, I'm not Andy. I'm Emmett.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.323
Andy sent me over to let you know
he's not gonna make it tonight.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.188
<i>Michael was suspicious.
I mean, think about it.</i>

18:15.294 --> 18:17.762
<i>We can't show Emmett
without blurring him.</i>

18:17.863 --> 18:21.629
Yeah, he's singing at
the Fire and Ice Ball tonight.

18:21.733 --> 18:24.531
Andy Richter is singing
at the Fire and Ice Ball?

18:24.636 --> 18:29.096
You know, I should send Andy
a little basket of poison muffins too.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.108
Muffins?

18:31.210 --> 18:34.179
Oh, my God. Dad?
You're the Muffin Man?

18:34.279 --> 18:37.146
You poisoned 25 teachers
during the '70s?

18:37.249 --> 18:39.183
Just the first two.
The others were copycats.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.014
- You poisoned Donnie, didn't you?
- We're losing them. Come on. Come on.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.716
Can I have your attention?
My son would like to say...

18:45.824 --> 18:47.883
just a couple of words about me.

18:47.993 --> 18:51.019
<i>And that's when Michael
noticed his own son.</i>

18:51.130 --> 18:53.223
- You came, huh?
- Yeah, well, it was wrong of me...

18:53.332 --> 18:55.823
to say what I did
about how I felt.

18:55.934 --> 18:59.461
No, you said what you felt, and maybe
it's about time I did the same thing.

18:59.571 --> 19:03.200
So why don't we just let him express himself?
Go ahead, Son.

19:03.308 --> 19:08.405
Um, I was going to say that you don't know
who my father really is.

19:08.514 --> 19:12.575
And-And-And that what has happened to us
is a great injustice...

19:12.684 --> 19:15.152
that we were never really
given a fair chance.

19:15.254 --> 19:18.553
But that's not the truth.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.591
We've been given
plenty of chances.

19:20.692 --> 19:23.490
And maybe, the Bluths
just aren't worth saving.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.826
Maybe we're not that likable. You know?
We're very self-centered.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.594
And my father may be the worst of us.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.692
Me too. You know, I-I seem to...

19:31.803 --> 19:34.400
I threaten people who I don't feel support me.

19:35.107 --> 19:39.168
He poisons them.
Anyway, here's my advice to you.

19:39.278 --> 19:42.042
Go and take a goody bag
and get out while you can.

19:44.983 --> 19:47.781
<i>The speech was disturbing, the food inedible...</i>

19:47.886 --> 19:51.117
<i>and the gift bags pretty frightening.</i>

19:51.223 --> 19:53.350
<i>And when Gob realized
he wouldn't get tipped...</i>

19:53.458 --> 19:55.517
Wait. No. No.
Where's everyone going?

19:55.627 --> 19:57.117
<i>The service got a little worse.</i>

19:57.229 --> 20:00.426
No one's leaving until I get my money!
I'll follow you to your cars!

20:00.532 --> 20:04.263
<i>Oh, and then that
old racist woman choked on Buster's thumb.</i>

20:04.369 --> 20:06.200
- My thumb! My thumb!
- This lady can't breathe.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.933
<i>All in all, it was one
of the Bluths' better dinner parties.</i>

20:11.143 --> 20:14.078
- Hey, what'd you think of the speech?
- You'd do great at Openings.

20:14.179 --> 20:17.842
You know, pal,
you do not have to go there.

20:17.950 --> 20:22.614
I've been very worried about your behavior.
You're always turning off burners and irons...

20:22.721 --> 20:26.714
and it may be OCD.

20:26.825 --> 20:30.625
OCD? No. I'm just cleaning up after Aunt Lindsay.
She never turns things off.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.629
Wow. Hmm.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.858
Explains why I saw hedge trimmers
zippin' around the driveway.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.162
I did it again, didn't I?
I'm so self-centered.

20:37.269 --> 20:40.432
From now on, I want you to just tell me
what's on your mind, okay?

20:40.539 --> 20:45.306
And I promise, you know,
I won't just hear what I wanna hear, okay?

20:47.112 --> 20:50.548
- I love my cousin.
- I love you, too, pal.

20:53.952 --> 20:56.113

20:56.221 --> 20:58.985
<i>The Bluth family gets some good news.</i>

They're all sending in donations.
And you know what the key was?

21:02.594 --> 21:05.324

21:05.430 --> 21:08.194
Well, I-I guess it really doesn't pay
to be desperate.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.860
It sure doesn't.

21:10.969 --> 21:13.802
<i>And cut.</i>

21:13.905 --> 21:15.805
Good job, man.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.535
Let's not celebrate yet.
We've still got the West Coast feed, guys.
