00:54.613 --> 00:56.615
If you open the
door that separates us

00:56.649 --> 00:59.518
from our creator.

00:59.551 --> 01:01.286
A false god in the sky.

01:01.754 --> 01:04.221
But you need
no doors to find God.

01:05.456 --> 01:09.796
If you believe my dear, Elizabetta,
you're not of sane mind.

01:10.930 --> 01:14.232
Can you look around this world
and believe in the goodness

01:14.266 --> 01:15.702
of a God,

01:15.735 --> 01:18.236
when all he shows us is pain.

01:20.907 --> 01:24.677
Famine, pestilence, greed,
war, disease, and death.

01:25.712 --> 01:27.847
They only rule this world.

01:28.715 --> 01:31.483
There's also
love and life and hope.

01:31.516 --> 01:33.385
Very little hope,
I assure you.

01:34.386 --> 01:38.891
Now, if a God of love
and life ever did co-exist

01:38.925 --> 01:40.660
with his fellow man,

01:40.693 --> 01:41.961
he is long since dead.

01:42.561 --> 01:47.499
Someone, some beast,
rules in this place.

01:47.532 --> 01:49.501
A false prophet in the sky.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.274
This is Chilly Billy.

01:56.308 --> 02:01.613
It's station 66.6 FM.

02:02.247 --> 02:08.586
Ghouls, werewolves, vampires,
ghosties with the mosties.

02:08.888 --> 02:11.724
It's Halloween, or as we
like to call it,

02:11.958 --> 02:14.459
Hell Hollows Eve.

02:18.765 --> 02:21.801
Up next for the ghoulies
and ghosties and hosties

02:21.834 --> 02:23.803
with the mosties we've
got all your favorites

02:23.836 --> 02:26.505
that go bump in the night.

02:35.882 --> 02:38.316
We've got a few new
stories and we'll be taking

02:38.350 --> 02:40.653
requests from some
loyal listeners.

02:40.686 --> 02:45.057
So buckle up because unlike
some we'll be right back.

03:30.569 --> 03:31.671
Fuck! Fuck!

04:33.833 --> 04:34.834
Hey guys.

04:34.867 --> 04:35.768
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.036
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:42.909 --> 04:44.043
You guys ready for tonight?

04:44.744 --> 04:45.278
Heck yeah.

04:45.912 --> 04:49.581
I spent all of my babysitting
money on this costume.

04:50.482 --> 04:51.751
This is going to be awesome.

04:56.689 --> 04:58.490
You need any help?

05:20.046 --> 05:21.747
What do you think you're doing?

05:21.781 --> 05:22.815
Nothing.

05:22.848 --> 05:24.650
Remember what
happened last year?

05:26.919 --> 05:28.453
We can't go through that again.

05:31.257 --> 05:33.159
Does anybody remember
where I put my helmet?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.994
I'm almost finished.

05:40.232 --> 05:42.101
We gotta be on the
lookout for bullies too.

05:43.169 --> 05:44.502
Speak of the devil.

05:52.812 --> 05:54.914
Hey kid, get off our turf.

05:55.448 --> 05:57.650
Leave my tree house alone, jerk.

06:02.088 --> 06:04.824
Hey, I just made those.

06:05.091 --> 06:06.491
Your club's stupid.

06:06.859 --> 06:08.560
I'm telling your mom.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.848
Hey guys, guess what I got?

06:30.582 --> 06:32.550
- All right.
- Nice.

06:44.997 --> 06:46.298
Uh-oh.

06:49.335 --> 06:50.535
I gotta go.

06:50.736 --> 06:51.771
Go?

06:52.271 --> 06:53.873
Why? It's not even late yet.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.809
10 missed calls from my
stepdad is why.

06:58.778 --> 07:01.013
Not tonight, it's Halloween.

07:02.782 --> 07:04.150
Let me go home and check in.

07:04.183 --> 07:05.351
Maybe that'll calm him down

07:05.384 --> 07:07.119
and I can catch up
with you guys.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.954
You want us to walk with you?

07:09.288 --> 07:10.689
We can wait outside your door.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.557
No, it'll be okay.

07:13.692 --> 07:15.795
Go have fun and save
some candy for me.

07:16.629 --> 07:17.763
Be safe.

07:17.797 --> 07:19.331
- Group hug.
- Group hug.

07:24.937 --> 07:26.639
Hey, call us if you need us.

07:41.487 --> 07:43.355
- Trick or treat?
- Trick or treat?

07:44.723 --> 07:46.725
- Trick or treat?
- Trick or treat?

07:46.759 --> 07:48.794
Trick or treat?

07:50.663 --> 07:51.964
Trick or treat?

07:51.997 --> 07:53.265
Stupid tree house club.

08:15.087 --> 08:16.288
This house is cheap.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.991
Ugh, can't eat those.

08:20.793 --> 08:21.794
Can't eat that.

08:22.795 --> 08:23.829
Are you kidding?

08:41.981 --> 08:42.982
This sucks.

10:46.071 --> 10:47.940
Happy Halloween.

10:47.973 --> 10:49.241
Happy Halloween.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.268
Kyra, get in the truck.

11:27.279 --> 11:28.514
You're grounded.

11:29.548 --> 11:30.482
For what?

11:30.816 --> 11:33.852
Sneaking off and causing more
destruction I gotta pay for.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.055
You and that
God-damn tree house.

11:37.022 --> 11:38.590
I swear it, I'll burn it down

11:38.624 --> 11:40.092
if you ever go there again.

11:40.727 --> 11:42.428
But everyone is out tonight.

11:43.095 --> 11:45.464
We were just going to
get some candy.

11:46.965 --> 11:48.067
I'll take this too.

11:48.768 --> 11:51.403
No sense in paying for
something you won't answer.

12:01.914 --> 12:04.049
What a no-good, sorry
excuse for a holiday.

12:12.324 --> 12:13.392
Your room.

12:13.693 --> 12:14.927
Now!

12:15.494 --> 12:16.962
This is so unfair.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.264
What'd you say girl?

12:26.004 --> 12:27.573
Please just let me go
out tonight.

12:28.374 --> 12:30.476
It was her favorite
night of the year.

12:38.651 --> 12:40.152
Not any more.

13:32.304 --> 13:33.405
Right, hit him in the head.

13:33.439 --> 13:35.307
Right between the eyes.

13:49.388 --> 13:51.691
Trick or treat?

16:45.597 --> 16:47.232
You did it again, didn't you?

16:48.968 --> 16:51.470
What kind of twisted demons
did you create this time?

16:55.675 --> 16:56.943
Dad, please.

16:56.976 --> 16:58.276
Dad, no, please.

16:58.745 --> 17:00.245
After all I've done
for you, girl.

17:00.512 --> 17:02.882
Good thing your mother isn't
here to see what you've become.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.617
Dad, please, no.

17:08.887 --> 17:10.222
No!

18:06.578 --> 18:09.816
Your soul is mine forever.

19:50.883 --> 19:54.654
We're back
in five, four, three.

19:56.656 --> 19:59.558
Woo, kiddies, we are just
getting started.

19:59.591 --> 20:02.460
But it's not always the young
ones that are being naughty,

20:02.494 --> 20:03.595
is it Paul?

20:04.462 --> 20:05.698
Nope.

20:05.731 --> 20:08.034
We got some grownups
that ain't never learned.

20:09.601 --> 20:10.803
Until they did.

20:38.965 --> 20:43.568
Tasty treat coming right up.

21:07.927 --> 21:08.995
Trick or treat?

21:10.129 --> 21:12.865
Well, now who are you?

21:13.366 --> 21:14.967
I'm Little Red Riding Hood.

21:15.001 --> 21:17.003
Oh, adorable.

21:17.535 --> 21:18.971
Well here, here's some candy.

21:19.171 --> 21:20.538
There you go.

21:21.741 --> 21:22.875
Wait a minute.

21:23.541 --> 21:25.778
Would you or your mother
want a cupcake?

21:25.811 --> 21:27.647
Are they gluten-free or vegan?

21:30.049 --> 21:32.718
Well of course they are.

21:32.752 --> 21:34.921
Of course.
Wait, hold on.

21:35.755 --> 21:36.923
Here you go.

21:37.356 --> 21:40.492
I'm good but sure my mom
will love one.

21:40.525 --> 21:42.594
They are very sweet and yummy.

21:42.895 --> 21:45.231
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:45.264 --> 21:47.066
You are so polite.

23:09.648 --> 23:13.719
You're kind of old to be
trick or treating, aren't you?

23:45.351 --> 23:46.852
It's not burned.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.855
What the fuck did you do to me?

23:55.027 --> 23:57.329
Say hello to death
you motherfucker.

24:03.302 --> 24:05.204
Die!

24:56.388 --> 24:58.724
What a nasty
way to go, Paul.

24:59.558 --> 25:03.362
Locals say that Grimsley
was never heard from again.

25:04.430 --> 25:07.833
Some say that he moved
away, but we know better.

25:08.367 --> 25:13.239
What a reminder, however,
to check those chocolates

25:13.873 --> 25:17.843
because you never know what
tricks are in your treats.

25:19.845 --> 25:21.347
And how do you not check
the chocolates

25:21.380 --> 25:22.715
in the first place, man?

25:23.149 --> 25:24.717
I don't know, shitty parenting?

25:25.751 --> 25:27.052
Super shitty.

25:28.154 --> 25:29.455
- Paul?
- Yeah.

25:29.488 --> 25:31.056
Do you like clowns?

25:31.090 --> 25:33.392
Dude, I fucking hate clowns.

26:04.523 --> 26:05.558
Yo, trolls?

26:05.591 --> 26:08.494
Man, you still got any
fuel left for this party?

26:08.527 --> 26:09.862
I got it.

26:09.895 --> 26:10.963
Can I cash value?

26:11.497 --> 26:12.765
Sure, bro.

26:13.899 --> 26:15.034
You're a good dude, man.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.938
Don't eat that.
Don't.

26:19.338 --> 26:21.040
- Okay, I won't.
- Good evening, ladies.

26:24.944 --> 26:26.145
No, don't eat that. Don't.

26:26.178 --> 26:27.279
I'm gonna need some of that.

26:28.914 --> 26:30.349
You know this is a
costume party, right?

26:30.583 --> 26:31.917
Yeah.

26:32.184 --> 26:34.353
So what are you
supposed to be?

26:35.321 --> 26:36.922
She's a cop, right?

26:37.289 --> 26:39.291
Don't you cops need bad
guys to chase?

26:43.462 --> 26:44.530
Oh that was funny.

26:44.563 --> 26:46.065
I thought it was
funny. I'm sorry.

26:46.098 --> 26:47.733
You're drunk.

27:02.514 --> 27:03.782
Fascinating, huh?

27:07.052 --> 27:08.320
What?

27:10.956 --> 27:12.324
I got a cure for that ailment.

27:12.726 --> 27:14.193
I'm not sure if I follow.

27:14.226 --> 27:16.262
However I'm probably
not interested.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.267
Well, if you change your
mind I've got a love letter

27:21.300 --> 27:22.434
with your name on it.

27:24.303 --> 27:27.106
Take two, call me in
the morning.

27:28.374 --> 27:29.475
First one's on me.

27:30.442 --> 27:32.011
Have fun.

27:32.044 --> 27:33.245
Will do.

27:51.997 --> 27:53.532
Trick or treat?

27:56.068 --> 27:58.537
Oh, hey baby, you ever play
red light, green light?

28:00.105 --> 28:01.540
I can go green all night long.

28:02.574 --> 28:03.575
Hey man.

28:03.609 --> 28:04.977
How's the party going, man?

28:07.146 --> 28:08.480
I gotta drop this off.

28:08.514 --> 28:09.815
I gotta dip.

28:13.452 --> 28:14.553
Go.

28:14.953 --> 28:16.488
Thanks, man. Thanks

28:16.522 --> 28:18.357
I need a little something
to take the edge off.

28:18.390 --> 28:19.258
You know what I mean?

28:19.291 --> 28:20.859
Look, man, I'm cool
with a lot of shit

28:20.893 --> 28:22.261
but I don't need
any details.

28:22.294 --> 28:24.163
And you didn't
get that from me.

28:25.931 --> 28:27.433
Get the fuck out of here.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.906
Watch it and keep your
hands to yourself.

28:35.274 --> 28:37.543
That's right, I ran
into you two.

28:37.777 --> 28:39.011
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:39.978 --> 28:41.480
Want me to make it up to you?

28:41.847 --> 28:43.449
I've got the
really good candy.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.484
If y'all want one
on the house?

28:47.286 --> 28:49.221
I understand if it's
not your thing.

28:50.155 --> 28:52.659
This is pure shit and
really expensive,

28:52.692 --> 28:55.427
mostly for celebrities
at festivals and whatnot.

29:02.434 --> 29:03.902
Bottoms up.

29:05.705 --> 29:06.939
Thanks, loser.

29:10.442 --> 29:11.610
Later, skanks.

29:18.016 --> 29:19.284
- Sup?
- Sup?

29:19.518 --> 29:20.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:32.097 --> 29:33.633
You're listening
to Chilly Billy

29:35.000 --> 29:36.969
on Psychotronic FM.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.539
666 FM.

29:42.742 --> 29:46.345
Ghouls, werewolves, vampires,

29:47.346 --> 29:49.014
ghosties with the mosties.

29:49.415 --> 29:54.987
It's Halloween, or as we like
to call it, Hell Hallows Eve.

29:56.656 --> 29:58.390
Can you dig it?

30:48.040 --> 30:48.842
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

30:48.875 --> 30:50.677
- Oh, hey bro.
- What's good, baby?

30:50.710 --> 30:51.678
You got the blue candy?

30:51.711 --> 30:53.680
Ah, you want some
of that trippy dippy?

30:53.713 --> 30:55.414
- That's right.
- I got that for you.

30:55.447 --> 30:56.649
Have fun.

31:12.464 --> 31:14.032
Fun night?

31:25.077 --> 31:26.512
I'd ask you the same thing

31:26.779 --> 31:28.480
if I didn't already
know the answer.

31:31.617 --> 31:37.356
See, honey, that is why
you are not my boyfriend.

31:43.128 --> 31:44.329
You're welcome.

32:00.112 --> 32:03.582
All right, this place is
a real fucking shit hole.

32:12.659 --> 32:14.092
You look like shit.

33:17.222 --> 33:18.390
What the fuck?

33:22.962 --> 33:25.197
What the fuck, man?
You took a picture of me?

33:26.465 --> 33:27.834
Did you take a picture of me?

33:30.670 --> 33:31.704
Are you all right?

33:40.512 --> 33:42.347
Fuck. What the fuck?

33:45.584 --> 33:46.819
What do you want?

33:46.853 --> 33:48.253
What do you want?

33:56.294 --> 33:57.329
A smoke?

33:57.764 --> 33:58.865
I got a nice car.

33:59.598 --> 34:00.599
Fuck.

34:02.935 --> 34:04.904
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

34:11.309 --> 34:12.543
Here, take my money.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.280
Here, have my money, man.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.284
Fuck.

34:19.786 --> 34:21.620
Fucking leave me
alone you freak.

35:02.995 --> 35:03.996
Fuck.

35:04.197 --> 35:05.031
Fuck.

35:05.064 --> 35:07.232
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

36:18.771 --> 36:21.540
I want you to call in
with your scariest ideas,

36:21.573 --> 36:24.043
your deepest fears, your
spookiest nightmares,

36:24.076 --> 36:26.979
so I can twist the knife
in to your stories.

36:27.013 --> 36:28.681
Can you dig it?

37:10.756 --> 37:11.824
Abs!

37:12.258 --> 37:13.793
Abs, you're not leaving are you?

37:14.093 --> 37:15.094
Are you leaving?

37:15.127 --> 37:16.128
No, don't leave.

37:16.361 --> 37:17.596
Party's just starting.

37:18.698 --> 37:19.765
Clearly.

37:21.566 --> 37:22.668
I gotta work.

37:22.702 --> 37:24.603
I'm sorry Matt didn't
show up again.

37:25.104 --> 37:26.404
Yeah, it's cool.

37:26.438 --> 37:27.539
He's a dick, so.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.276
Hey, don't be like that.

37:30.309 --> 37:32.945
There are loads of other
dudes here to hook up with.

37:32.979 --> 37:34.046
Fuck that guy.

37:34.379 --> 37:35.748
Well, that's not gonna happen.

37:35.948 --> 37:37.717
But I gotta take off.

37:37.750 --> 37:38.784
You be safe.

37:38.818 --> 37:39.852
Oh, no, you be safe.

38:41.981 --> 38:43.115
Fuck it.

38:46.018 --> 38:48.520
Well, if I'm gonna be
stuck here all night

38:48.553 --> 38:49.655
I shouldn't waste it.

38:55.061 --> 38:56.095
Boring Abbie.

38:57.296 --> 38:58.530
Never have any fun.

39:01.934 --> 39:03.169
Predictable Abbie.

39:03.769 --> 39:05.805
This is why no guys like you.

39:07.206 --> 39:08.207
Creepy.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.541
Creepy Abbie.

39:10.209 --> 39:11.944
Your only friends are dead.

39:17.615 --> 39:18.851
Whoa.

39:19.852 --> 39:21.187
Not tonight big guy.

39:30.562 --> 39:31.831
Maybe some other time.

39:53.252 --> 39:55.254
Who did he think he
was selling to?

40:08.868 --> 40:10.236
Hm, coconut.

40:13.305 --> 40:15.007
Weird choice.

40:18.978 --> 40:20.279
Impressive.

40:29.822 --> 40:30.890
Very impressive.

40:32.658 --> 40:33.993
Good for you.

40:46.272 --> 40:50.943
You know it's not often a
man keeps me up all night.

40:53.813 --> 40:54.980
You...

40:55.948 --> 40:59.018
You probably wouldn't be the
type of guy to Swayze a girl,

40:59.051 --> 41:00.152
would you?

41:01.320 --> 41:02.721
Probably be early.

41:09.829 --> 41:11.697
Is it getting hot in here?

41:16.202 --> 41:18.370
Oh, this old thing?

41:19.672 --> 41:21.207
I was just doing the dishes.

41:22.775 --> 41:23.843
Do you like it?

41:25.945 --> 41:27.246
It'll be our little secret.

41:29.081 --> 41:30.850
No need to be shy.

41:34.453 --> 41:36.055
Let me just.

41:37.857 --> 41:39.091
Get that out of the way.

41:40.392 --> 41:41.827
That a boy.

41:43.229 --> 41:44.396
That's it.

41:44.697 --> 41:46.132
That's muscular.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.035
So much more muscular than him.

41:52.805 --> 41:54.640
You feel so alive.

41:56.775 --> 41:57.843
Pardon me.

42:10.856 --> 42:12.158
So warm.

42:14.093 --> 42:15.361
So much better than him.

42:18.097 --> 42:22.268
Just start here and I'll
take care of you.

42:23.869 --> 42:26.138
And you'll take care
of me, won't you?

42:35.414 --> 42:37.316
What?
Don't you want to play?

42:39.018 --> 42:40.152
Let me just adjust.

42:40.953 --> 42:42.254
Just adjust it.

42:49.161 --> 42:50.229
There you go.

42:51.897 --> 42:52.998
We need two hands.

42:53.032 --> 42:55.134
Let's get this one
released here.

42:59.772 --> 43:01.073
So firm.

43:17.456 --> 43:19.091
I'll get that.

44:30.362 --> 44:31.964
No! No!

46:14.099 --> 46:15.501
No! No! No!

46:16.969 --> 46:21.573
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

46:21.607 --> 46:26.412
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

46:26.646 --> 46:27.980
No!

46:32.985 --> 46:34.119
Oh, man.

46:34.553 --> 46:35.954
What a dick.

46:35.988 --> 46:37.055
Oh.

46:38.190 --> 46:42.528
Welcome back kids to the
Psychotronic FM Halloween show.

46:42.762 --> 46:46.098
We continue down this dark
and dusty road on the night

46:46.131 --> 46:48.500
when the space between
the living and the dead

46:48.768 --> 46:50.135
is at its thinnest.

46:50.602 --> 46:54.173
When devils and demons
walk amongst us.

46:54.707 --> 46:57.976
When the skeletons in our
closet come out to play.

46:58.177 --> 47:00.647
But before we do any of that,
we've got to pay these bills.

47:00.680 --> 47:01.781
We got to keep the lights on.

47:01.815 --> 47:04.416
Especially when the things
that go bump in the night

47:04.616 --> 47:07.119
await us around every corner.

47:09.388 --> 47:10.222
Hello?

47:10.255 --> 47:11.990
Hey what's
Billy's biggest fear?

47:12.024 --> 47:13.058
Yeah, I'll ask him.

47:13.258 --> 47:14.626
Cool, happy Halloween.

47:14.661 --> 47:16.428
Hey, Bill, we've got a
caller on the line

47:16.462 --> 47:20.132
that wants to know what
your biggest fear is.

47:20.165 --> 47:21.166
My biggest fear?

47:21.433 --> 47:22.501
Mm-hmm.

47:24.069 --> 47:25.204
The dark.

47:31.043 --> 47:35.314
Good evening, Count Dracula.

47:41.721 --> 47:42.822
Hello?

47:42.856 --> 47:45.324
Let me ask you something,
what are you wearing?

47:45.357 --> 47:46.391
What?

47:46.425 --> 47:48.427
Answer
the question, Daryl.

47:48.728 --> 47:50.562
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

47:52.364 --> 47:53.700
Fucking Dracula.
Am I right?

47:56.068 --> 47:57.135
Not exactly.

47:57.169 --> 47:59.672
You generic-ass
walking copyright violation.

47:59.706 --> 48:01.440
Every fucking year, Daryl.

48:01.473 --> 48:02.441
Okay, you know what?

48:02.474 --> 48:04.376
You wear the same costume
every year, right?

48:04.944 --> 48:07.747
Hey, hey, I do that for
you and Lenny, dude.

48:07.780 --> 48:09.147
As a favor.

48:09.181 --> 48:10.683
Thank you so much, sweetheart.

48:12.584 --> 48:13.786
Put you in coffin right now.

48:14.152 --> 48:15.387
Okay, you know what?

48:15.420 --> 48:16.723
First of all, it's tradition.

48:16.756 --> 48:17.790
So...

48:19.124 --> 48:20.092
You know why I'm calling you?

48:20.125 --> 48:22.227
If you're calling about
the rabbits, I told you

48:22.261 --> 48:23.428
that I will have them.

48:23.630 --> 48:25.364
Lenny loves his rabbits.

48:26.164 --> 48:28.333
So now you're gonna
tell me what Lenny likes.

48:29.334 --> 48:30.637
Just a reminder, that's all.

48:30.670 --> 48:31.771
I will have them.

48:32.672 --> 48:34.306
Along with the?

48:34.339 --> 48:35.440
The pumpkins.

48:36.508 --> 48:37.543
Atta boy.

48:38.645 --> 48:40.379
Okay, I hate to
cut this short, Vin,

48:41.814 --> 48:43.148
but it's getting late.

48:43.615 --> 48:44.751
Sun's going down.

48:46.585 --> 48:48.153
And you know what that means.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.690
A vampire's gotta eat.

48:52.157 --> 48:53.325
Yeah, he does.

48:53.358 --> 48:54.526
Gay.

48:55.662 --> 48:56.729
Jerk off.

49:00.633 --> 49:02.067
You're so pretty.

49:03.836 --> 49:05.772
I can't believe I'm doing this.

49:06.773 --> 49:08.240
Look, you're not playing along.

49:08.273 --> 49:10.609
Because we're not
17 anymore, Chuck.

49:14.413 --> 49:15.614
We used to have fun.

49:16.816 --> 49:19.284
Come on, just a little?

49:19.953 --> 49:23.288
No, you had fun while I
had to convince

49:23.322 --> 49:25.557
the whole senior year that
you didn't fucking bone me

49:25.591 --> 49:27.092
in a closet.

49:27.326 --> 49:28.728
Well, that offer still stands.

49:28.761 --> 49:30.663
No, that's gonna be a
strong no for me.

49:30.964 --> 49:33.131
I'm only doing this
because Cat, you know Cat?

49:33.565 --> 49:35.100
She won't leave me alone.

49:35.969 --> 49:38.303
Well that's a real
confidence booster, Marie.

49:38.771 --> 49:40.539
You know chicks actually
really dig me.

49:41.373 --> 49:42.541
You know that?

49:42.574 --> 49:43.910
I'm a nice guy.

49:43.943 --> 49:45.845
Let me stop you right there.

49:46.445 --> 49:48.246
You know, we used to be friends

49:49.649 --> 49:53.185
before you turned into
a total fucking jerk

49:53.218 --> 49:55.287
who I only tolerate at parties.

49:57.790 --> 49:58.825
Works for me.

49:58.858 --> 50:00.292
Time's up love birds.

50:00.325 --> 50:01.894
Leave some closet for
the rest of us.

50:10.970 --> 50:13.906
As an officer of the law it
was your job to frisk him.

50:14.439 --> 50:16.676
Please don't make me do
anything else like that.

50:16.709 --> 50:18.276
I mean, can we do
something better?

50:40.833 --> 50:42.735
Thank you for such
another fun party.

50:42.769 --> 50:43.936
Thank you for coming.

50:46.304 --> 50:48.607
- See you at work.
- All right, be safe.

50:48.641 --> 50:49.642
Bye.

50:57.917 --> 50:58.951
- Hi.
- Hey.

50:58.985 --> 51:00.185
- Hiya.
- Marie?

51:01.888 --> 51:03.455
You're my fourth
pickup from here.

51:03.488 --> 51:04.657
Is it a busy party?

51:04.691 --> 51:05.825
I mean, I guess.

51:05.858 --> 51:08.260
I only called you because
some asshole blocked my car.

51:10.663 --> 51:12.665
Oh, just a few spares
in the back, you know?

51:12.932 --> 51:14.232
Never to careful.

51:17.502 --> 51:18.671
Is that the right address?

51:19.005 --> 51:20.305
Yeah.

51:49.836 --> 51:50.870
Good God.

51:51.104 --> 51:52.537
What are you doing?

51:53.305 --> 51:54.506
Are you okay?

51:59.478 --> 52:01.580
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

52:03.315 --> 52:04.449
Are you okay?

52:04.951 --> 52:06.853
I told him this isn't my house.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.689
Are you gonna arrest me?

52:11.423 --> 52:12.892
What's your address?
I'll call you...

52:17.730 --> 52:18.765
Stay here.

52:19.999 --> 52:21.399
Whatever,

52:22.334 --> 52:23.435
you're the cop.

52:34.747 --> 52:36.048
Jimmy?

52:37.482 --> 52:38.718
Jimmy are you home?

52:38.751 --> 52:39.886
You left the door...

52:55.735 --> 52:57.837
Way more remotes
than they have TVs.

52:57.870 --> 52:59.371
No, it's just
games in here.

52:59.404 --> 53:00.438
There's no safe.

53:03.876 --> 53:06.045
Hey Chuck, please help, man.

53:14.020 --> 53:15.520
Chuck, check this out.

53:17.690 --> 53:19.058
I'm the queen of England.

53:24.897 --> 53:26.032
Dude, let's go man.

53:26.065 --> 53:27.399
It's not worth it.

53:27.432 --> 53:28.533
One last check
and I'm done.

53:30.670 --> 53:32.404
Yeah, man.
Fucking shit.

53:36.175 --> 53:37.442
Is that the cops?

53:37.910 --> 53:39.679
She only wishes
she was a cop.

53:40.680 --> 53:41.814
Ain't that right, Marie?

53:46.185 --> 53:47.552
You son of a bitch.

53:50.122 --> 53:51.389
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

53:53.192 --> 53:54.694
Alex, dial 911.

53:54.727 --> 53:56.428
Dialing 911.

53:58.698 --> 53:59.899
Where the fuck are you going?

54:07.106 --> 54:08.674
Connection failed.

54:10.442 --> 54:11.610
Time to go, man.

54:11.978 --> 54:14.546
Nah, I wanna have a
little fun first.

54:16.615 --> 54:17.783
You're on your own.

54:23.122 --> 54:25.091
Why do you always
complicate things?

54:25.858 --> 54:27.026
Huh?

54:27.827 --> 54:29.494
You've been a stuck
up bitch to me

54:29.527 --> 54:30.997
ever since the sixth grade.

54:35.067 --> 54:38.871
Ever since your parents
died you turned me away.

54:44.110 --> 54:45.177
Look at me.

54:46.646 --> 54:47.880
Open your mouth.

54:57.023 --> 54:58.090
Son of a...

54:59.491 --> 55:00.625
Fuck you, Chuck.

55:01.761 --> 55:03.062
Get the fuck out of my house.

55:23.548 --> 55:24.884
Marie?

55:27.787 --> 55:29.487
This is your last chance, Marie.

55:35.261 --> 55:36.996
That was a sweet kick
to the face.

55:50.009 --> 55:51.509
Marie?

57:03.983 --> 57:04.984
And he screamed out,

57:05.017 --> 57:06.584
"Run, bitch. Run."

57:06.618 --> 57:07.720
So she ran.

57:36.215 --> 57:37.349
Fuck.

58:40.112 --> 58:41.247
Marie?

58:51.824 --> 58:54.760
Here's to another spooky year.

58:55.895 --> 58:56.996
Night ain't over yet though.

59:00.766 --> 59:02.268
Make sure you eat
before midnight.

59:02.301 --> 59:03.736
Remember what
happened last time.

59:04.436 --> 59:05.771
Okay, Boomer.

59:07.273 --> 59:09.975
That's right folks, the
wonderful people at Free Ride

59:10.009 --> 59:12.311
wanna make sure you make it
back in one piece tonight

59:17.983 --> 59:19.985

pies for 16.66 tonight only.

59:32.264 --> 59:34.466

59:39.071 --> 59:40.472

59:41.307 --> 59:42.441
Sorry, what's tonight?

59:43.509 --> 59:44.843
Halloween.

59:45.044 --> 59:46.745
It's like my favorite
night of the year.

59:46.779 --> 59:47.913
Wow, Halloween.

59:47.947 --> 59:49.982
Well sorry to
break it to you, bud,

59:50.015 --> 59:51.917
but nobody gives a shit
about Halloween.

59:51.951 --> 59:52.952
All right?

59:52.985 --> 59:55.187
It's just a bunch of
pre-pubescent little shits

59:55.221 --> 59:58.324
and creepy weirdos who like
feeding other people's children.

01:00:00.526 --> 01:00:02.061
Besides, who are you
supposed to be?

01:00:02.094 --> 01:00:03.762
You look like my
great-grandfather.

01:00:05.364 --> 01:00:07.299
Hey, there's no smoking in here.

01:00:08.133 --> 01:00:08.968
Whatever, dude.

01:00:09.001 --> 01:00:10.302
I'll give you five stars,
all right?

01:00:10.336 --> 01:00:12.037
That's not how
this ride works, okay?

01:00:15.107 --> 01:00:16.342
- Ride's over.
- Dude?

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:20.145
- Get out.
- I don't know where...

01:00:20.479 --> 01:00:22.948
- Are you fucking serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

01:00:23.683 --> 01:00:26.252
Another rider will be out
here to pick you up later.

01:00:28.487 --> 01:00:29.955
One star.

01:00:30.956 --> 01:00:32.091
Piece of shit.

01:00:37.062 --> 01:00:39.798
- Happy Halloween, bitch.
- Fuck you.

01:00:42.935 --> 01:00:44.169
Target acquired.

01:00:47.539 --> 01:00:48.841
So I've been making like

01:00:48.874 --> 01:00:51.176
a lot of money with this
outfit tonight.

01:00:52.544 --> 01:00:53.680
Like a super bunny.

01:00:53.713 --> 01:00:56.582
Like I've been fucking so
many guys at the same time.

01:00:56.615 --> 01:00:58.851
And like I make money so quick.

01:00:58.884 --> 01:01:00.286
- Rabbiting hard?
- Yeah.

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.253
Oh, yeah.

01:01:01.287 --> 01:01:02.488
Lucky you, if I have
to fuck one more clown

01:01:02.521 --> 01:01:03.889
I swear I'm gonna lose it.

01:01:03.922 --> 01:01:04.990
Mm, yeah.

01:01:05.024 --> 01:01:06.158
It's just really
exhausting, you know?

01:01:06.191 --> 01:01:07.860
Totally, totally.
And getting that...

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.361
Everywhere.

01:01:09.395 --> 01:01:10.929
It's really hard to wash out.

01:01:11.263 --> 01:01:12.865
Yeah, they're kind of creepy.

01:01:13.232 --> 01:01:14.133
Yeah.

01:01:14.166 --> 01:01:15.034
I don't like when they're
about to climax

01:01:15.067 --> 01:01:17.102
and then they hit me
with the flowers.

01:01:17.136 --> 01:01:18.237
Wait, what?

01:01:20.539 --> 01:01:21.874
Yeah!

01:01:21.907 --> 01:01:22.941
Where does it come from?

01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:23.976
Their dick?

01:01:24.009 --> 01:01:24.910
Everywhere.

01:01:24.943 --> 01:01:26.979
And it's just like, it's
just all over me.

01:01:27.579 --> 01:01:29.214
And it's like, it's
Tuesday, you know?

01:01:29.248 --> 01:01:31.250
I'm not, I'm not trying
to have that.

01:01:31.283 --> 01:01:33.085
I'm just trying to have
like just a simple,

01:01:33.118 --> 01:01:35.287
like simple fuck, simple
blow and just call it a day.

01:01:35.321 --> 01:01:36.422
- Yeah exactly.
- Yeah, totally.

01:01:36.455 --> 01:01:38.123
I don't need a skit.

01:01:38.324 --> 01:01:40.025
I'm not, this isn't a show.

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:42.628
A full-blown role
play situation.

01:01:42.662 --> 01:01:44.263
You should charge more for that.

01:01:44.296 --> 01:01:45.397
I should.

01:01:45.431 --> 01:01:46.465
Look.

01:01:46.498 --> 01:01:47.866
Look at that clown car.

01:01:49.535 --> 01:01:54.973
I have time but do I have room?

01:01:58.444 --> 01:01:59.845
I'm game.

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:11.523
Not it.

01:02:12.458 --> 01:02:13.660
Fuck me.

01:02:13.693 --> 01:02:16.261
- I already did the other weirdo.
- No, no, that doesn't count.

01:02:16.295 --> 01:02:17.096
Like fuck me.

01:02:17.129 --> 01:02:18.464
Like, that means you
wanna fuck 'em.

01:02:18.497 --> 01:02:19.565
So I'm out.

01:02:19.598 --> 01:02:20.899
You're in.

01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:22.901
Hey, ladies.

01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:26.872
Fuck you.

01:02:27.272 --> 01:02:28.240
Shall we?

01:02:28.273 --> 01:02:32.211
Let's go see what this
motherfucker's doing.

01:02:32.478 --> 01:02:35.347
Damn, did somebody order
some Count Chalkula?

01:02:35.715 --> 01:02:37.082
Definitely not.

01:02:37.116 --> 01:02:39.118
You know I can't eat
fucking cereal.

01:02:39.585 --> 01:02:41.320
And now I'm hungry.

01:02:41.688 --> 01:02:43.122
Ah, fuck me.

01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:45.157
- What?
- I think he's my ride.

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:52.197
Bye.

01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:08.013
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

01:03:08.313 --> 01:03:09.348
You gone die, bitch.

01:03:10.048 --> 01:03:11.450
Bye.

01:03:16.989 --> 01:03:18.390
You know, I can role
the windows up

01:03:18.424 --> 01:03:20.426
or even down if you want?

01:03:21.059 --> 01:03:24.396
Save it, you're not getting
any freebies from me.

01:03:26.532 --> 01:03:27.667
I'm just making conversation.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.636
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:29.669 --> 01:03:31.103
Shit.

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:40.012
Okay Bran Stroker,
what's on your mind?

01:03:41.547 --> 01:03:43.182
Actually Bram Stoker
was the author.

01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:45.484
He wasn't the vampire.

01:03:45.685 --> 01:03:49.388
Sure he was and then he
gets killed off in the end

01:03:49.421 --> 01:03:51.557
by Eddie van Halen or some shit.

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:55.060
So you're going home
for the evening?

01:03:56.395 --> 01:03:57.496
What do you mean?

01:03:57.797 --> 01:04:01.266
From my job as a prostitute?

01:04:03.636 --> 01:04:06.305
Not really making any
assumptions about your vocation.

01:04:08.775 --> 01:04:10.175
I'm going to see my pimp.

01:04:10.442 --> 01:04:11.744
He needs me for something.

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:14.179
I think he wants to take
me to a party.

01:04:15.447 --> 01:04:16.448
Your pimp?

01:04:18.584 --> 01:04:20.052
I always wanted to meet a pimp.

01:04:21.587 --> 01:04:23.723
Oh honey, he'd love your ass.

01:04:25.257 --> 01:04:26.659
This is you.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.595
You really wanna meet my pimp?

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.097
Yeah.

01:04:32.397 --> 01:04:35.033
And you're not some sort
of spy or that shit?

01:04:36.836 --> 01:04:38.638
It'd make me way
cooler if I was?

01:04:40.239 --> 01:04:41.406
Okay, fuck it.

01:04:42.107 --> 01:04:44.176
Although he might fuck
you up a bit.

01:04:44.209 --> 01:04:45.410
He's kind of hard to read.

01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:50.516
Take that hit.
Hit.

01:04:58.557 --> 01:05:00.259
Hey, Daddy.

01:05:06.298 --> 01:05:07.432
Who the fuck is this?

01:05:08.133 --> 01:05:09.468
He's my ride.

01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:10.837
Well what the fuck does he want?

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.639
I think he wants to
suck your blood.

01:05:14.874 --> 01:05:17.276
Nah, I think he wants
to suck my dick.

01:05:21.246 --> 01:05:22.214
Well, what is it?

01:05:22.247 --> 01:05:23.382
His blood or his dick?

01:05:28.053 --> 01:05:29.388
Time to go fruitcake.

01:05:35.795 --> 01:05:36.796
Did I miss something?

01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:03.488
Shit.

01:06:09.428 --> 01:06:11.864
Oh, seriously?

01:06:20.172 --> 01:06:21.741
- Why didn't you hit her?
- She's a woman.

01:06:22.008 --> 01:06:23.643
- What are you sexist?
- What?

01:06:23.676 --> 01:06:25.177
Equal opportunity.

01:06:29.749 --> 01:06:31.651
See, why can't you do that?

01:06:32.217 --> 01:06:33.385
She was really big.

01:06:33.418 --> 01:06:34.553
You fought the Taliban.

01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:36.656
You always do this, Daryl.

01:06:36.689 --> 01:06:38.290
You get in trouble and you
call me to bail you out.

01:06:38.323 --> 01:06:39.859
See, there's no I in team,

01:06:40.258 --> 01:06:41.593
- Daryl.
- You had a gun?

01:06:42.394 --> 01:06:43.562
Yeah, why?

01:06:43.595 --> 01:06:44.897
You should have used it
from the start.

01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:45.765
I don't like guns,
you know that.

01:06:45.798 --> 01:06:47.232
That's why I only
carry one around.

01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:49.636
So what do you wanna
do with her?

01:06:50.235 --> 01:06:51.470
I got her.

01:06:56.308 --> 01:06:58.477
So who's dick was I
supposed to be sucking?

01:06:59.444 --> 01:07:00.713
Who are you, mister?

01:07:02.247 --> 01:07:03.548
I'm fucking Dracula.

01:07:17.362 --> 01:07:19.364
Jesus Christ, you smell
like wolf pussy.

01:07:22.902 --> 01:07:25.772
Next year I'm going as
Hercules, no more masks.

01:07:26.304 --> 01:07:27.539
Where's your other glove?

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.776
Got stuck in your mom's pubes.

01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:32.277
Smell my finger.

01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:45.825
Sorry I'm late.

01:07:47.827 --> 01:07:50.262
As excuses go, that
one's pretty good.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.364
Boom.

01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:53.800
Another year.

01:07:58.805 --> 01:08:01.306
Dude, you make six
figures a year.

01:08:01.339 --> 01:08:02.642
Why are you still buying
the same fucking beer

01:08:02.675 --> 01:08:03.710
we had when we were
in high school?

01:08:03.743 --> 01:08:04.844
What's wrong with you?

01:08:05.144 --> 01:08:06.545
Works for me.

01:08:06.746 --> 01:08:07.914
Where's Lenny?

01:08:08.413 --> 01:08:11.818
Lenny wasn't looking so hot
so I told him to take a nap

01:08:12.085 --> 01:08:13.351
and I gave him a Valium.

01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:14.553
You roofied Lenny?

01:08:15.253 --> 01:08:16.823
So I was watching the
news yesterday

01:08:16.856 --> 01:08:19.323
and it had this full
report on Chango Chicken.

01:08:19.357 --> 01:08:20.727
Wait, don't change the subject.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.794
You roofied Lenny.

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:22.929
You ever eaten there?

01:08:22.962 --> 01:08:24.362
Yeah, the fast food
chicken chain.

01:08:24.395 --> 01:08:25.497
What about it?

01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:26.933
Yeah, so this report
was saying they tested

01:08:26.966 --> 01:08:29.769
eight separate locations
over 100 times

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:32.304
in the course of a month
and they found fecal matter

01:08:32.337 --> 01:08:34.974
in the ice more than
95% of the time.

01:08:35.573 --> 01:08:37.274
Fecal matter.
That's shit.

01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:38.477
Human shit.

01:08:39.011 --> 01:08:41.446
- Yeah, we know what that means.
- Unbelievable.

01:08:41.714 --> 01:08:43.548
- Right?
- How is that even possible?

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:45.785
Like mechanically?

01:08:45.818 --> 01:08:48.319
Is that not the most fucked
up thing you've ever heard?

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.388
I mean, you did just
roofie Lenny.

01:08:52.357 --> 01:08:54.727
Hey, speaking of which, wanna
go see if it's game time?

01:08:55.627 --> 01:08:56.863
Yeah.

01:08:58.798 --> 01:09:00.767
Again, I feel like I
can't stress this enough,

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.901
you roofied Lenny.

01:09:02.267 --> 01:09:03.870
- He'll be fine.
- Wakey wakey.

01:09:04.336 --> 01:09:05.938
I don't think he'll be fine.

01:09:06.706 --> 01:09:07.874
There we go.

01:09:07.907 --> 01:09:09.474
- There we go.
- God damn it.

01:09:09.508 --> 01:09:10.877
Why do you put that
shit all over him?

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:12.678
You know he's
just gonna tear it off.

01:09:13.946 --> 01:09:15.046
He looks awesome.

01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:16.048
He does not look awesome.

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:18.316
- All right, it's feeding time.
- Sorry dude.

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:20.987
I don't feel so hot.

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.654
Yeah, 'cause he
fucking drugged you.

01:09:22.688 --> 01:09:23.522
Okay.

01:09:23.555 --> 01:09:24.890
Okay Scottie, give him
some distance.

01:09:24.924 --> 01:09:25.957
All right, come on.

01:09:25.992 --> 01:09:27.492
Yeah, a lot of distance.

01:09:27.926 --> 01:09:29.729
Don't forget what
happened in 2014.

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:32.397
I fucked up that cape.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.466
Yeah.

01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:40.773
Cheers.

01:09:47.511 --> 01:09:48.848
Have I mentioned I
love this part

01:09:48.881 --> 01:09:50.683
because I fucking
love this part.

01:09:58.456 --> 01:09:59.859
Morning!

01:10:02.594 --> 01:10:03.595
Ahh!

01:10:04.664 --> 01:10:05.665
This never gets old.

01:10:06.598 --> 01:10:08.634
I can't hear you
all when you're talking

01:10:08.668 --> 01:10:09.802
all at the same time.

01:10:10.335 --> 01:10:13.840
Some of you might be wondering
why you're here right now

01:10:14.439 --> 01:10:17.810
and not at home safely tucked
away in your nightcaps.

01:10:17.844 --> 01:10:21.379
Well, I'm gonna need
you to think long

01:10:21.413 --> 01:10:23.582
and hard about your
recent actions.

01:10:23.615 --> 01:10:25.718
Some of you might think
this is a little bit extreme

01:10:25.751 --> 01:10:29.155
but to be honest we
don't give a shit

01:10:29.188 --> 01:10:30.823
what you fucking people think.

01:10:32.524 --> 01:10:34.492
Here's why.

01:10:36.428 --> 01:10:38.563
You don't seem to understand

01:10:39.065 --> 01:10:41.968
because none of you give a shit

01:10:42.335 --> 01:10:45.137
how your actions
affect other people.

01:10:46.438 --> 01:10:47.807
And I for one,

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.575
did not go overseas
and risk my fucking life

01:10:50.609 --> 01:10:52.812
to come back here and
watch you fucking dipshits

01:10:52.845 --> 01:10:54.080
rip my country apart.

01:10:55.715 --> 01:10:57.717
Yeah we didn't watch our
friend get all fucked up

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:59.051
for you fucks.

01:10:59.252 --> 01:11:01.620
Fucking medical
testing bullshit.

01:11:01.654 --> 01:11:02.655
Also that.

01:11:10.462 --> 01:11:13.465
So now each and every
one of you

01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:16.869
have a shot at redemption.

01:11:17.837 --> 01:11:20.139
Redemption, yay!

01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:24.442
Is his dick out?

01:11:26.879 --> 01:11:28.014
Why is his dick out?

01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.485
There you go.

01:11:37.056 --> 01:11:38.057
Kobe!

01:11:54.539 --> 01:11:55.975
Now,

01:11:56.008 --> 01:11:59.511
I don't want any of you
to say that I'm not fair.

01:12:00.046 --> 01:12:03.515
I want to give you all a
very fair chance.

01:12:04.516 --> 01:12:08.654
So in the spirit of fairness
we're gonna let you guys go.

01:12:12.158 --> 01:12:13.659
Y'all feel like running?

01:12:14.961 --> 01:12:17.163
Your best bet is to
head for the tree line.

01:12:18.664 --> 01:12:20.032
We won't
chase you there.

01:12:22.268 --> 01:12:26.839
And I mean this in all
sincerity, good luck rabbits.

01:12:29.942 --> 01:12:31.677
That means fucking run!

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:47.727
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:12:55.134 --> 01:12:56.836
I didn't even fucking
do anything.

01:13:02.742 --> 01:13:03.743
Help!

01:13:12.685 --> 01:13:13.618
No, no.

01:13:13.652 --> 01:13:15.587
You don't know how to
follow instructions.

01:13:21.593 --> 01:13:23.229
I love Halloween, I swear.

01:13:23.262 --> 01:13:24.830
I swear.

01:13:26.598 --> 01:13:28.868
What the fuck is going on?

01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:33.239
I can't hear and I
can't see anything.

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:37.710
What the fuck is that?

01:13:45.851 --> 01:13:47.219
10 points.

01:13:57.263 --> 01:13:58.864
Who the fuck are you people?

01:14:06.405 --> 01:14:08.774
Ooh, 10 points baby.

01:14:19.919 --> 01:14:20.953
What the fuck?

01:14:24.323 --> 01:14:25.623
What is that?

01:14:25.658 --> 01:14:26.725
anybody?

01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:33.065
Fuck!

01:14:38.237 --> 01:14:39.271
Did you see that?

01:14:39.305 --> 01:14:40.306
Oh shit!

01:14:53.719 --> 01:14:54.854
Help!

01:14:55.154 --> 01:14:56.288
Did you imagine that?

01:14:56.322 --> 01:14:58.991
Lenny, Lenny, Lenny.

01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:23.382
Help!

01:15:24.817 --> 01:15:25.951
Fuck, no.

01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:47.139
Help!
Help!

01:15:52.077 --> 01:15:53.245
Shit.

01:15:53.279 --> 01:15:54.413
What the fuck?

01:16:19.438 --> 01:16:21.307
No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:22.508 --> 01:16:24.777
Ooh, that was gross.

01:16:32.785 --> 01:16:34.153
Hey, Lenny.

01:16:34.186 --> 01:16:36.488
We got some beers over
here whenever you're done.

01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:38.757
Take your time, it's fine.

01:16:38.958 --> 01:16:40.326
We got a lot of time.

01:16:48.934 --> 01:16:50.469
So maybe fantasy football then?

01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:52.004
Switch it up.

01:16:52.905 --> 01:16:54.073
What the fuck, Scottie?

01:16:58.444 --> 01:16:59.912
Paul, what the hell, man?

01:17:00.212 --> 01:17:01.814
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:17:01.847 --> 01:17:03.215
Do you think it's kids
fucking around

01:17:03.249 --> 01:17:05.317
or did you forget to pay
the power bill?

01:17:06.418 --> 01:17:07.886
- Ow.
- Fuck off.

01:17:33.379 --> 01:17:34.446
Okay.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.581
Wow.

01:17:35.614 --> 01:17:40.419
Well, we apparently have
ghosts here at Psychotronic FM

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:45.090
and Chilly Billy has
stepped out with the sage

01:17:45.391 --> 01:17:47.326
to cleanse the studio.

01:17:47.359 --> 01:17:50.562
But in the meantime, we're
gonna be accepting calls

01:17:50.596 --> 01:17:56.001
for one final story
request of the night.

01:18:08.147 --> 01:18:09.415
Yeah, hang on a second.

01:18:09.448 --> 01:18:11.483
Bill, I've got some
callers on the line.

01:18:11.517 --> 01:18:12.618
What are you thinking about?

01:18:12.652 --> 01:18:14.420
Do you got a story in mind?

01:18:14.453 --> 01:18:16.355
Anything I can help
you out about

01:18:16.388 --> 01:18:19.158
with like witches or zombies?

01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:21.293
What flavor you want?

01:18:21.661 --> 01:18:23.595
Give me anything.
I can spin the best of them.

01:18:25.331 --> 01:18:26.432
Okay.

01:18:26.633 --> 01:18:28.000
Yes.

01:18:28.534 --> 01:18:30.035
Uh, let me ask him.

01:18:30.469 --> 01:18:32.271
Hey, Bill, we've got a
caller on the line

01:18:32.304 --> 01:18:36.342
saying she's been a fan of
yours for quite a while.

01:18:36.643 --> 01:18:37.943
Want to take this one?

01:18:38.544 --> 01:18:39.878
All right.

01:18:41.947 --> 01:18:44.049
You've got Chilly Billy
on the line, sweetheart.

01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:45.984
Oh my God, Chilly Billy.

01:18:46.018 --> 01:18:47.119
Yes.

01:18:47.152 --> 01:18:49.188
Can you tell us the one
about the house on the hill?

01:18:49.455 --> 01:18:52.024
None of my friends believe
me when I tell them

01:18:52.057 --> 01:18:53.559
that ghost hunters came to town.

01:18:54.694 --> 01:18:56.328
But of course darlin'.

01:18:56.362 --> 01:18:59.031
You sound pretty young
so you must've been a kid

01:18:59.064 --> 01:19:00.332
when those guys came to town.

01:19:02.267 --> 01:19:05.304
It started out on a cold
and lonely night.

01:19:06.105 --> 01:19:07.106
Kind of like tonight.

01:19:10.109 --> 01:19:12.211
GPS looks like we should
be coming up on the house

01:19:12.244 --> 01:19:13.512
in a few minutes.

01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:16.882
Super creepy.

01:19:17.416 --> 01:19:18.550
How do you even see out here?

01:19:18.584 --> 01:19:20.486
This fog is so intense.

01:19:24.623 --> 01:19:26.625
Watch out for that
down tree, Curtis.

01:19:36.435 --> 01:19:37.637
Wow.

01:19:38.537 --> 01:19:40.973
I'm not paying you to
damage the equipment.

01:19:44.677 --> 01:19:46.044
Hang tight.

01:19:46.078 --> 01:19:47.179
I'll see what I can do.

01:19:48.013 --> 01:19:49.281
I'll help you.

01:19:56.555 --> 01:19:59.158
I'm not so sure how we're
gonna get out of this one,

01:19:59.191 --> 01:20:00.259
it looks quite stuck.

01:20:03.495 --> 01:20:08.066
All right team, Simon, Judy
and myself, we'll head up

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.135
to the house, start
getting things sorted.

01:20:10.169 --> 01:20:12.471
Curtis, Vanessa,
you two stay back,

01:20:12.504 --> 01:20:14.674
see if you can get the van
up the rest of the way.

01:20:14.707 --> 01:20:16.408
Agreed?
Let's go.

01:20:18.043 --> 01:20:19.111
See you guys.

01:20:19.144 --> 01:20:20.479
Flash the headlights
when we arrive

01:20:20.512 --> 01:20:22.047
and I'll signal with
my flashlight.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.449
- All right?
- All right.

01:20:28.153 --> 01:20:30.255
So how do you suppose
we get out of this one?

01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:31.825
I don't know.

01:20:31.858 --> 01:20:34.226
I just know that it's not
gonna be me digging it out.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.395
Right.

01:20:36.428 --> 01:20:37.730
My mom's the host of the show,

01:20:38.096 --> 01:20:39.598
I don't have to do
any real work.

01:20:41.099 --> 01:20:42.735
Fine, let's go find
some stupid stick.

01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:11.764
Not funny, Curtis.

01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:13.465
Cut it out.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.534
Oh, come on now, it's Halloween.

01:21:52.639 --> 01:21:56.676
Well as you can see,
despite the fire damage,

01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:58.443
the building repairs
look intact.

01:22:00.512 --> 01:22:02.481
Let's go inside and see
what we can find.

01:22:20.633 --> 01:22:21.834
So what made you want to travel

01:22:21.868 --> 01:22:23.535
around the country
chasing ghosts?

01:22:24.837 --> 01:22:27.172
Did you do any research
before joining this team

01:22:27.205 --> 01:22:28.775
or are you just in it
for the paycheck?

01:22:28.808 --> 01:22:29.809
Huh.

01:22:30.275 --> 01:22:33.880
Why would I want to be
in these spooky ass woods

01:22:33.913 --> 01:22:35.614
without something in it for me?

01:22:35.648 --> 01:22:37.082
I don't know.

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.418
Okay, so what is it then?

01:22:39.451 --> 01:22:43.622
I mean you do realize that
none of this is real, right?

01:22:43.656 --> 01:22:46.425
Like it's just about finding
the truth and then showing it.

01:22:46.458 --> 01:22:50.295
See now that's what you think.

01:22:50.329 --> 01:22:51.798
Y'all should be wise
with the spirits.

01:22:51.831 --> 01:22:54.867
Respect them so they
respect you, look after you.

01:22:54.901 --> 01:22:56.168
Eurgh.

01:22:56.201 --> 01:22:57.870
Okay, now you just
sound like my mom.

01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:14.186
Judy, you okay?

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.455
We kind of lost you
there for a second.

01:23:16.488 --> 01:23:17.757
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:20.359
I don't know what just
happened there.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:24.797
I must be tired or, I don't
know, dehydrated or something.

01:23:25.263 --> 01:23:26.099
- Judy
- Let's do this.

01:23:26.131 --> 01:23:27.900
it looked like
you were kind of in pain

01:23:27.934 --> 01:23:29.134
there for a moment.

01:23:29.167 --> 01:23:32.437
Listen, if you need to take a
break, if you want to stop-

01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:33.673
No, no, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

01:23:33.706 --> 01:23:35.708
Let's just, let's move on.

01:23:42.915 --> 01:23:44.383
I'm okay.

01:23:47.219 --> 01:23:50.522
30 years ago it was said
that a terrible tragedy

01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:52.659
happened in this very room.

01:23:53.458 --> 01:23:57.629
A young deranged boy
locked himself in the house

01:23:58.163 --> 01:23:59.632
and set fire to it.

01:24:00.867 --> 01:24:02.769
Sorry, Judy.
One sec.

01:24:05.672 --> 01:24:06.906
Damn battery keeps dying.

01:24:15.648 --> 01:24:17.215
Hello?

01:24:18.918 --> 01:24:20.787
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.723
At this rate we're gonna
have to go back for more.

01:24:26.391 --> 01:24:27.660
We're ready.
All right, Judy.

01:24:29.662 --> 01:24:31.229
Curtis, this is pointless.

01:24:31.263 --> 01:24:32.165
Okay?

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:33.800
We should just go back
and ask for help.

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:34.934
Did you hear that?

01:24:36.636 --> 01:24:38.705
There is nothing out here
that's gonna help us.

01:24:38.738 --> 01:24:39.806
All right?

01:24:41.573 --> 01:24:42.909
Like I said,

01:24:44.777 --> 01:24:45.945
you just
have to have faith.

01:24:46.511 --> 01:24:47.612
Judy?

01:24:49.949 --> 01:24:51.249
Judy?

01:24:52.018 --> 01:24:53.385
Judy?

01:24:54.286 --> 01:24:55.655
Judy?

01:24:55.688 --> 01:24:58.523
Right, maybe we should call it.

01:24:58.758 --> 01:24:59.792
No, Tim.

01:24:59.826 --> 01:25:01.259
No.

01:25:02.028 --> 01:25:02.929
No way.

01:25:02.962 --> 01:25:05.263
This house is trying to
tell us something.

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.469
Anyway, our research
has indicated

01:25:10.502 --> 01:25:14.573
that a group of young
boys were with young Jacob

01:25:14.941 --> 01:25:18.044
when he locked himself inside
to vandalize the contents

01:25:18.077 --> 01:25:19.311
of this house.

01:25:20.646 --> 01:25:21.781
The boys claimed

01:25:21.814 --> 01:25:23.716
Jacob threatened violence
against them,

01:25:24.382 --> 01:25:25.484
so they ran.

01:25:26.152 --> 01:25:28.721
Oh, see that's why you
can't come trick or treating

01:25:28.755 --> 01:25:29.989
with us tonight.

01:25:30.022 --> 01:25:31.556
You're just a little baby.

01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:32.892
Mommy's boy.

01:25:33.425 --> 01:25:34.426
Wa.

01:25:34.459 --> 01:25:35.661
That was good.
That was good.

01:25:36.996 --> 01:25:38.164
You go into the basement,

01:25:38.197 --> 01:25:40.933
you grab one of those old
comic books they left behind,

01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:43.502
you can come out
with us tonight.

01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:15.467
Our research shows us
that the fire originated

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.670
in the...

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:32.551
In the basement.

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:38.390
Though Judy protested
her instincts

01:26:38.423 --> 01:26:40.092
her curiosity got the
better of her.

01:26:40.927 --> 01:26:45.330
Judy knew Simon and Tim wouldn't
want to go in the basement

01:26:46.165 --> 01:26:49.802
but she had to follow her
ghostly friend.

01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:05.685
Tim, we're gonna need
more light down here.

01:27:06.953 --> 01:27:07.987
Clearly.

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.422
As Tim helped Judy to her feet.

01:27:16.863 --> 01:27:17.997
They slowly...

01:27:19.866 --> 01:27:20.900
Fuck sake, Paul.

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.735
Help me fix whatever's going on.

01:27:25.004 --> 01:27:26.038
Paul!

01:27:27.539 --> 01:27:28.641
Fuck.

01:27:29.008 --> 01:27:30.408
Damn it.

01:27:37.582 --> 01:27:38.751
Jesus.

01:27:39.719 --> 01:27:41.053
Sorry, Bill.

01:27:41.854 --> 01:27:43.990
Well obviously we have
a power issue, so...

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:47.425
Do you want to just
call it a night?

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.594
This is our night.

01:27:50.329 --> 01:27:52.965
I've got a new version of
the story, just get it on.

01:27:52.999 --> 01:27:54.634
What the fuck's
gotten in to you?

01:27:55.301 --> 01:27:56.869
It's the fucking power, man.

01:28:08.014 --> 01:28:09.614
It should be back up in
about a minute.

01:28:18.157 --> 01:28:19.759
Hey, Bill, can I see that?

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.494
Thanks.

01:28:28.634 --> 01:28:29.669
- Hello?
- Do you know how

01:28:29.702 --> 01:28:31.070
difficult it is
for me to sit here

01:28:31.103 --> 01:28:32.604
- and listen to
- You got the wrong number

01:28:32.638 --> 01:28:34.206
the story
inaccurately be represented.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.541
Okay, well we already
told that story tonight.

01:28:36.574 --> 01:28:37.843
So tune in next year, all right?

01:28:37.877 --> 01:28:39.577
You can not
imagine the pain

01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:41.113
- that this has caused my family.
- Happy halloween to you

01:28:41.147 --> 01:28:42.181
too, darling. Okay?

01:28:42.214 --> 01:28:43.481
This is wron-

01:28:43.515 --> 01:28:44.951
Jesus.

01:28:47.853 --> 01:28:49.655
Right, where were we?

01:28:49.689 --> 01:28:52.925
Judy kept creeping down
those basement steps

01:28:53.292 --> 01:28:55.661
not knowing what she was
about to find.

01:28:56.796 --> 01:28:57.930
Jacob?

01:29:06.706 --> 01:29:07.707
Make a sign.

01:29:39.071 --> 01:29:40.806
Oh, Jesus. What was that?

01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:44.977
We're not here to hurt you.

01:29:46.846 --> 01:29:48.681
Show yourself.
We mean you no harm.

01:29:52.218 --> 01:29:53.853
Show yourself again.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.254
We mean you no harm.

01:30:00.326 --> 01:30:01.927
Jacob?

01:30:04.596 --> 01:30:06.999
Oh, God.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.635
Jacob?

01:30:19.611 --> 01:30:20.880
It's on fire.

01:30:20.913 --> 01:30:22.648
The house is on fire.

01:30:22.681 --> 01:30:24.750
Little baby scared of the dark.

01:30:25.184 --> 01:30:26.352
Let me out.

01:30:26.385 --> 01:30:27.787
I set the room on fire.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.155
Let me-

01:31:08.327 --> 01:31:09.795
Show yourself.

01:31:14.366 --> 01:31:18.070
I said show yourself you
little fucking snitch.

01:31:18.504 --> 01:31:21.040
Judy knew the boy had
locked himself inside,

01:31:21.073 --> 01:31:24.210
despite the reports of the
boys attempts to get him out.

01:31:29.949 --> 01:31:32.184
Hello persistent caller,
how can I help you?

01:31:32.218 --> 01:31:35.354
Finally, your
story is wrong.

01:31:36.021 --> 01:31:37.189
Wrong?

01:31:37.223 --> 01:31:39.258
How can it be wrong?
It's my buddy's story.

01:31:39.558 --> 01:31:41.626
No, it's inaccurate.

01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:45.197
How could you possibly
know this one?

01:31:45.231 --> 01:31:47.099
I've got a firsthand
source for this.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.968
Not as close as I do.

01:31:53.305 --> 01:31:54.373
What's your name, lady?

01:31:59.445 --> 01:32:01.113
Do you smell smoke?

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.149
Do you think it's the van?

01:32:03.849 --> 01:32:05.017
No.

01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:07.386
It smells like a forest fire.

01:32:12.124 --> 01:32:13.792
You think you're gonna
blackmail me, huh?

01:32:14.894 --> 01:32:16.162
You ain't blackmailing me.

01:32:37.283 --> 01:32:38.817
I hear you.

01:32:39.385 --> 01:32:41.253
I hear you you fucking punk.

01:32:45.057 --> 01:32:46.325
Where you gonna run now, huh?

01:32:59.872 --> 01:33:01.106
I got you, punk.

01:33:21.293 --> 01:33:24.296
How can you sit
there and listen to the story

01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:27.199
of my family and have their
name dragged through the mud?

01:33:32.104 --> 01:33:35.174
Curtis, this thing
says that the house is on fire.

01:33:41.847 --> 01:33:43.215
We gotta get them out of there.

01:33:51.090 --> 01:33:52.091
No, Jacob.

01:33:56.095 --> 01:33:57.796
No, Jacob.

01:34:25.124 --> 01:34:26.492
Let us out of here.

01:34:28.127 --> 01:34:29.261
Come on, let's go.

01:34:29.295 --> 01:34:30.863
I'm out of here.

01:34:32.531 --> 01:34:33.899
Pull!

01:34:34.967 --> 01:34:36.402
Pull! Pull the door!

01:34:36.435 --> 01:34:37.836
Unlock the door.

01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:38.904
It's stuck.

01:34:38.937 --> 01:34:40.105
It won't move.

01:34:40.406 --> 01:34:41.573
Pull.

01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:45.144
No.

01:34:45.177 --> 01:34:47.346
No, I can.
No, I can save him.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:48.881
No, no.

01:34:49.248 --> 01:34:50.249
No.

01:34:50.282 --> 01:34:52.051
No, I can save him.

01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:59.558
No, no, I can save him.

01:34:59.591 --> 01:35:00.959
I can save him.

01:35:00.993 --> 01:35:02.061
What's happening to her?

01:35:13.038 --> 01:35:15.107
What happened in there?

01:35:16.575 --> 01:35:19.044
My mother's last words
were about her and the boy.

01:35:19.278 --> 01:35:21.480
And it's taken me years
to track down the one

01:35:21.513 --> 01:35:23.082
who's responsible for
this tragedy.

01:35:25.184 --> 01:35:27.986
Your firsthand source is a
lot more than a misled story.

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.888
He's the one who
caused all of it.

01:35:30.222 --> 01:35:31.557
And who will pay for it.

01:35:33.092 --> 01:35:34.393
Mark my words.

01:35:35.461 --> 01:35:36.862
Paul?

01:35:38.597 --> 01:35:39.865
Paul!

01:35:41.066 --> 01:35:42.067
Help.

01:35:45.137 --> 01:35:46.205
Help. Help.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.981
Paul?

01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:59.518
Paul?

01:36:53.005 --> 01:36:54.106
No!

01:37:45.692 --> 01:37:48.026
There's a small bit
of justice in this world

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.261
for those who have been wronged.

01:37:49.294 --> 01:37:51.430
You know you get really sleepy
after you eat white people.

01:37:51.463 --> 01:37:52.732
Oh.

01:37:54.533 --> 01:37:58.036
For some we create
our own justice

01:37:59.338 --> 01:38:00.773
and revel in the insanity.

01:38:01.273 --> 01:38:02.608
That hits the spot, right?

01:38:04.476 --> 01:38:05.778
So how many I get?

01:38:05.812 --> 01:38:07.346
All of 'em.

01:38:07.379 --> 01:38:08.547
Wait, hold on.

01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:10.215
You got a little bit
of the pimp right here.

01:38:10.249 --> 01:38:11.483
There you go, got him.

01:38:11.517 --> 01:38:13.352
Yeah, it had glitter in it.

01:38:15.454 --> 01:38:17.589
Most have a worse
time figuring it all out.

01:38:18.524 --> 01:38:21.728
While the tragic few rely
on others to stay sane,

01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:24.129
or clean up our messes.

01:38:24.596 --> 01:38:28.233
It can cross years before
we feel any retribution

01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:32.037
or that the people who have
wronged us find their ends.

01:38:33.773 --> 01:38:38.811
But one thing is for
sure, we're not alone.

01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:59.197
Do you see that?

01:38:59.231 --> 01:39:00.566
What in the fuck?

01:39:00.867 --> 01:39:02.401
Holy shit.

01:39:03.569 --> 01:39:04.804
I knew it was Halloween.

01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:06.706
But white people
gotta get it together.

01:39:26.693 --> 01:39:28.560
Do you guys wanna go to
Waffle House?

01:39:28.594 --> 01:39:30.329
- Yeah.
- I know you don't.

01:39:30.562 --> 01:39:32.097
I'll start.

01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:54.620
This could be it.
Go on, open up.

01:39:55.621 --> 01:39:56.856
Come on, come on, come on.

01:39:56.889 --> 01:39:58.156
I can't fit.

01:39:58.190 --> 01:39:59.424
Come on, get in.

01:40:14.774 --> 01:40:16.341
Come on, come on, come on.
Go.

01:40:18.878 --> 01:40:20.579
Come on, come on, come on.

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.348
Come on. Jesus Christ.

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.255
Hello?
Is anyone there?

01:41:05.323 --> 01:41:06.893
Shit.
Fuck this.

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:09.361
You wanna watch a movie?

01:41:09.394 --> 01:41:09.896
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:41:09.929 --> 01:41:11.229
Let's go snuggle.

01:41:11.263 --> 01:41:12.364
Yeah.

01:41:33.019 --> 01:41:34.419
Like that.

01:41:34.453 --> 01:41:35.888
- What's wrong with yours?
- It's a dude

01:41:35.922 --> 01:41:37.389
- and that's his nose.
- What's wrong with your prostat?

01:41:37.422 --> 01:41:38.523
What the hell is that?

01:41:38.557 --> 01:41:40.026
- Look, mine's at least a dick.
- Keep on trucking, baby.

01:41:40.059 --> 01:41:41.293
Mine is at least a dick.

01:41:41.828 --> 01:41:43.663
Shit job for my tit job.

01:41:43.863 --> 01:41:45.263
I like that.

01:41:45.965 --> 01:41:47.365
So when are you gonna do it?

01:41:47.767 --> 01:41:48.935
The tits or the shit?

01:41:48.968 --> 01:41:50.535
You did the shit already

01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:52.337
so when are you gonna
do the tits?

01:41:52.939 --> 01:41:55.474
I think I'll need to do
like 10 more shit jobs

01:41:55.507 --> 01:41:56.475
and then we're even.

01:41:56.508 --> 01:41:57.677
Oh, okay.

01:41:57.710 --> 01:41:59.812
I kinda want them like
boulder size.

01:41:59.846 --> 01:42:01.279
Ah, yeah.

01:42:02.648 --> 01:42:05.317
I mean like mechanically
how is that even po-

01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.919
How flexible does your
ass have to be

01:42:06.953 --> 01:42:08.386
to shit in an ice machine?

01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:10.322
I think you just put
your ass in it.

01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:12.859
Have you seen my ass?
Get in the pumpkin.
