WEBVTT

00:03.769 --> 00:04.971
Where is he?

00:04.971 --> 00:06.342
Just calm down.

00:06.343 --> 00:07.043
Don't tell me to calm
down. I want to see him.

00:07.044 --> 00:09.282
Where is he?

00:09.283 --> 00:10.417
Come on.

00:14.996 --> 00:16.064
How the hell did this happen?

00:16.065 --> 00:17.334
We're still piecing it together.

00:17.335 --> 00:18.471
They found him last night

00:18.472 --> 00:19.473
in an alley near the shipyards.

00:19.474 --> 00:20.475
And who found him?

00:20.476 --> 00:21.745
An anonymous tip.

00:21.746 --> 00:22.981
By the time they got
there, it was too late.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.016
And when did you get here?

00:24.017 --> 00:25.320
This morning.

00:25.321 --> 00:26.423
Henry called, I caught the next flight.

00:26.424 --> 00:27.726
Well, why the hell
wouldn't anyone tell me...

00:27.727 --> 00:28.995
You were already on your way back.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.500
You wouldn't have done any good.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:59.102 --> 01:01.540
I'm sorry.

01:06.954 --> 01:09.560
Do we know who did this?

01:09.561 --> 01:11.163
I'm still looking into it.

01:11.164 --> 01:13.703
But you have some idea.

01:13.704 --> 01:15.274
We...

01:15.275 --> 01:17.077
we should talk when you're settled.

01:18.716 --> 01:20.184
Why?

01:20.185 --> 01:23.092
What's going on?

01:23.093 --> 01:24.730
Who did this?

01:24.731 --> 01:29.173
Look, it's too early to know for sure,

01:29.174 --> 01:30.744
but so far all the
evidence I've gathered

01:30.745 --> 01:32.180
points to Helen Magnus.

02:16.488 --> 02:17.923
You're out of your mind.

02:17.924 --> 02:19.560
I didn't believe it either at first.

02:19.561 --> 02:20.796
At first?

02:20.797 --> 02:22.134
We ran ballistics

02:22.135 --> 02:24.204
on the bullets we pulled from the body.

02:24.205 --> 02:25.742
They came from Magnus' nine mil.

02:25.743 --> 02:27.112
So?

02:27.113 --> 02:28.715
And she had gunshot residue on her coat.

02:28.716 --> 02:29.985
All that proves

02:29.986 --> 02:30.920
is that she fired the gun at some point.

02:30.921 --> 02:33.961
And he contacted me.

02:33.962 --> 02:35.699
Who, the big guy?

02:35.700 --> 02:37.570
Two nights before he died.

02:37.571 --> 02:38.706
He was concerned about Magnus.

02:38.707 --> 02:41.647
"Concerned"? Concerned about what?

02:41.648 --> 02:43.851
He said she'd started to slip. Mentally.

02:46.859 --> 02:48.963
I never saw any evidence of that.

02:48.964 --> 02:50.569
Yeah, well, she was hiding it.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.707
I'm a psychiatrist.

02:52.708 --> 02:54.544
Look, all I can tell
you is what he told me.

02:54.545 --> 02:55.547
Apparently,

02:55.548 --> 02:57.117
it's a condition she's had for years.

02:57.118 --> 02:58.854
He found out about it recently,

02:58.855 --> 03:00.024
agreed to let it slide,

03:00.025 --> 03:01.228
but it got to a point

03:01.229 --> 03:02.597
where he thought he had to do something.

03:02.598 --> 03:04.268
This is...

03:04.269 --> 03:05.638
this is crazy.

03:05.639 --> 03:07.108
This is Magnus we're talking about.

03:07.109 --> 03:08.678
Why would he make
something like that up?

03:10.316 --> 03:12.988
Will, just so you know...

03:12.989 --> 03:16.664
I have no choice but
to invoke article 9.

03:19.171 --> 03:22.043
Wait a second.

03:22.044 --> 03:23.281
Where is she?

03:23.282 --> 03:25.719
Level three isolation.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.891
What?!

03:27.892 --> 03:29.929
She didn't do this!

03:29.930 --> 03:32.836
Then she has nothing to worry about!

03:40.389 --> 03:41.825
Will...

03:41.826 --> 03:44.998
Oh, thank God.

03:47.707 --> 03:48.875
Are you okay?

03:48.876 --> 03:50.379
How could I be?

03:50.380 --> 03:53.219
They're telling me that I
killed one of my dearest friends.

03:53.220 --> 03:54.656
What do you mean, they're telling you?

03:56.126 --> 03:57.429
I don't remember what happened.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.099
Honestly, I have...

03:59.100 --> 04:02.306
I've absolutely no
memory of the past week.

04:02.307 --> 04:04.211
Well, were you injured?

04:04.212 --> 04:05.949
Were you exposed to something?

04:05.950 --> 04:07.854
No, physically I'm fine.

04:07.855 --> 04:09.023
The tox screen was negative.

04:10.962 --> 04:12.264
Someone did this to me.

04:12.265 --> 04:15.406
Someone deliberately erased my memories.

04:15.407 --> 04:16.776
How?

04:16.777 --> 04:17.810
I don't know!

04:17.812 --> 04:18.880
Aren't you listening to me?

04:20.952 --> 04:23.425
I'm sorry.

04:23.426 --> 04:24.828
I...

04:24.829 --> 04:27.367
I just...

04:27.368 --> 04:29.473
I'm just as confused as you are.

04:31.979 --> 04:35.788
Someone's trying to set me up.

04:35.789 --> 04:37.325
Someone's trying to make
it look like I killed...

04:37.326 --> 04:38.929
All right, listen to me, listen to me.

04:39.965 --> 04:41.000
Okay?

04:41.001 --> 04:42.270
We're going to get
to the bottom of this,

04:42.271 --> 04:44.976
I promise.

04:49.522 --> 04:54.332
He was one of my oldest friends, Will.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.269
You have to help me.

04:56.270 --> 04:57.439
Please?

04:59.211 --> 05:01.884
Of course.

05:42.984 --> 05:44.285
There you are.

05:44.286 --> 05:47.259
I've been looking all over for you.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.436
Is he, uh...

05:51.437 --> 05:53.407
Yeah.

05:53.408 --> 05:55.747
We moved him over an hour ago.

05:55.748 --> 06:00.357
He always said he wanted
to be laid to rest here,

06:00.358 --> 06:02.697
on the grounds.

06:02.698 --> 06:05.537
It looks nice.

06:05.538 --> 06:08.243
You did a good job.

06:14.192 --> 06:15.494
Will's back.

06:15.495 --> 06:16.563
He wants to see us.

06:16.564 --> 06:18.467
You tell him to wait a bit.

06:18.468 --> 06:21.141
He says it's important.

06:21.142 --> 06:22.276
Something about article 9.

06:24.516 --> 06:26.053
What?

06:29.095 --> 06:31.232
Declan doesn't actually
believe she did it.

06:31.233 --> 06:33.237
Doesn't matter.

06:33.238 --> 06:36.177
What's article 9?

06:37.581 --> 06:39.118
Well, according to
the Sanctuary charter,

06:39.119 --> 06:40.320
any time there's
suspicion of wrongdoing,

06:40.321 --> 06:41.824
they refer the matter

06:41.825 --> 06:42.960
to the other heads of household

06:42.961 --> 06:45.733
for review. It's Magnus' rule.

06:45.734 --> 06:47.371
What the hell are we going to do?

06:47.372 --> 06:48.339
Well, we can start by finding out

06:48.340 --> 06:49.910
who's really behind this.

06:49.911 --> 06:51.213
What do you guys know?

06:52.785 --> 06:54.822
Uh, big guy came to me.

06:54.823 --> 06:55.892
He said he was going to old city

06:55.893 --> 06:57.361
to meet someone.

06:57.362 --> 06:59.199
I went to Magnus' office before bed,

06:59.200 --> 07:00.937
but the door was closed.

07:00.938 --> 07:02.774
Come on...

07:02.775 --> 07:04.545
there's got to be somebody
who knows something,

07:04.546 --> 07:08.487
some proof that she's innocent.

07:11.362 --> 07:12.731
All right, I'm going to
check out the crime scene.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.235
I'll go with you.

07:14.236 --> 07:16.607
I guess I should try
to go through her files,

07:16.608 --> 07:18.646
see if there's anything to
indicate who was after her.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.350
Yeah, that's a good idea.

07:22.223 --> 07:25.462
You're the only guy who can do this.

07:25.463 --> 07:29.238
No one else can crack
her encryption codes.

07:31.879 --> 07:33.782
Damn...

07:37.625 --> 07:41.734
this is where they found his body.

07:48.484 --> 07:51.392
I should have been here.

07:51.393 --> 07:52.627
You think it would have helped?

07:55.335 --> 07:56.437
I don't know.

07:56.438 --> 07:58.675
Come on, let's look around.

07:58.676 --> 08:02.284
Get those freaky eyeballs
of yours into action.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.038
Have you noticed Magnus
acting strangely lately?

08:11.039 --> 08:13.377
You're asking me?

08:13.378 --> 08:16.818
I mean, she's a weirdo
pretty much all the time.

08:18.992 --> 08:21.129
Declan said that the big guy told him

08:21.130 --> 08:22.766
that she was starting to slip.

08:22.767 --> 08:24.471
Like amy winehouse slip?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.812
I don't know if screaming at paparazzi

08:27.813 --> 08:30.118
is quite her speed.

08:30.119 --> 08:31.687
It's more like little things.

08:31.688 --> 08:33.592
Huh...

08:33.592 --> 08:35.530
What?

08:37.436 --> 08:38.738
It's probably nothing.

08:38.739 --> 08:39.941
It's...

08:39.942 --> 08:41.578
last week she sends me this email

08:41.578 --> 08:42.948
asking me to pick up a new intake.

08:42.948 --> 08:45.955
I go to the address,
but it wasn't there.

08:45.956 --> 08:47.927
The abnormal wasn't there?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.434
No, like, the whole
building wasn't there.

08:50.435 --> 08:51.669
The address didn't exist.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.707
It must have been a mistake.

08:53.708 --> 08:54.877
Did you ask her about it?

08:54.878 --> 08:56.815
Yeah, she denied ever
having sent the email.

08:56.816 --> 08:58.085
Then the next day, I get
another email from her

08:58.086 --> 08:59.621
with the exact same request.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.462
It was weird...

09:06.606 --> 09:09.613
and you're not listening to me anymore.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.822
What is that?

09:20.239 --> 09:22.511
I knew your freaky eyeballs

09:22.512 --> 09:24.281
would come up with something.

09:29.662 --> 09:31.633
It's a surveillance camera.

09:31.634 --> 09:33.170
The cops set up hundreds
of 'em all over the city.

09:33.171 --> 09:34.640
Well, this one was pointed

09:34.641 --> 09:38.248
directly at our crime scene.

09:38.249 --> 09:40.620
No scheduled maintenance.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.758
There's no reason it should be gone.

09:42.759 --> 09:43.795
So it could have caught the whole thing.

09:43.796 --> 09:45.933
Yeah, well, the footage gets uploaded

09:45.934 --> 09:47.337
to the main server.

09:47.338 --> 09:48.005
I might be able to
hack in and retrieve it.

09:48.006 --> 09:49.642
Nice.

09:49.643 --> 09:51.045
That's the best news I've had all day.

09:51.046 --> 09:52.316
I'll put the word out
to some of my contacts.

09:52.317 --> 09:54.286
Maybe somebody knows something.

09:54.287 --> 09:55.857
Oh, hey,

09:55.858 --> 09:58.630
I managed to get into
the doc's computer.

09:58.631 --> 09:59.833
Felt like crap doing it, but...

09:59.834 --> 10:01.303
What'd you get?

10:01.304 --> 10:02.273
I'm just getting started,
but I did find these.

10:03.977 --> 10:05.948
Brain scans?

10:05.949 --> 10:07.218
Yeah, going back six years.

10:07.219 --> 10:10.091
Doc's been scanning herself regularly.

10:10.092 --> 10:13.031
The most recent one is two weeks ago.

10:13.032 --> 10:14.100
Huh...

10:14.101 --> 10:16.339
What is it?

10:16.340 --> 10:18.110
Find that video.

10:18.111 --> 10:19.814
All right.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.703
How did you get these?

10:28.704 --> 10:29.972
How do you think?

10:29.973 --> 10:32.144
Bloody hell.

10:33.882 --> 10:36.086
Don't tell me you're
actually buying into this.

10:36.087 --> 10:37.557
What do you mean?

10:37.558 --> 10:39.762
These scans show a
pattern of deterioration

10:39.763 --> 10:40.932
Lasting years.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.336
You're telling me nobody,

10:42.337 --> 10:43.972
none of us would have noticed anything?

10:43.973 --> 10:45.242
Well, the big guy noticed.

10:45.243 --> 10:46.412
In fact, coming clean about it

10:46.413 --> 10:47.816
Is probably what got him killed.

10:47.817 --> 10:49.252
Just stop it. Stop it!

10:50.923 --> 10:52.761
Magnus didn't do this!

10:52.762 --> 10:54.130
She's been set up.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.367
Somebody must have planted these.

10:55.368 --> 10:57.773
Who?

10:57.774 --> 10:59.209
Who had access to her computer?

10:59.210 --> 11:00.479
Think about it, Will.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.818
Why'd she bring you onboard last year?

11:02.819 --> 11:05.056
She's never needed any help before.

11:05.057 --> 11:07.328
She was looking for
someone to replace her.

11:07.329 --> 11:09.501
This is ridiculous.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.771
Look, if you can provide me

11:10.772 --> 11:11.907
with an alternate theory that works,

11:11.908 --> 11:13.242
I'm happy to listen.

11:13.243 --> 11:14.345
Until then, I got to proceed
based on the evidence.

11:14.346 --> 11:15.682
And what does that mean?

11:15.683 --> 11:18.923
The other Sanctuary
heads have charged me

11:18.924 --> 11:20.393
with gathering evidence against her.

11:20.394 --> 11:21.830
What is this, a witch hunt?

11:21.831 --> 11:23.334
We want to get to the truth,

11:23.335 --> 11:24.403
just like you.

11:24.404 --> 11:27.143
After all she's done for you, huh?

11:29.115 --> 11:30.317
That's not all.

11:31.856 --> 11:34.862
They've voted to send in a triad.

11:34.863 --> 11:36.198
A triad?

11:36.199 --> 11:38.236
A team of investigators

11:38.237 --> 11:41.077
uniquely qualified for
situations like this.

11:41.078 --> 11:44.986
And what makes them so
"uniquely qualified"?

11:44.987 --> 11:46.556
They're telepaths.

11:46.557 --> 11:50.566
They're going to get inside her mind.

11:53.206 --> 11:54.474
You know, they' I got to admit,

11:54.475 --> 11:55.978
I feel kind of...

11:55.979 --> 11:57.616
invaded, compromised.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.286
It's a common reaction.

11:59.287 --> 12:00.389
People tend to feel nervous

12:00.390 --> 12:02.359
around our skill set.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.831
Skill set.

12:03.832 --> 12:05.033
That's an interesting way of putting it.

12:05.034 --> 12:06.070
Listen, can I get you...

12:06.071 --> 12:08.508
No, we ate on the way here.

12:08.509 --> 12:10.480
I'm sorry.

12:10.481 --> 12:12.217
When we begin an investigation,

12:12.218 --> 12:13.520
it's really very hard

12:13.521 --> 12:15.225
not to read everybody's thoughts.

12:15.226 --> 12:16.695
You see, the first emotions we sense

12:16.696 --> 12:19.101
are often the most important.

12:19.102 --> 12:22.207
Okay, so, um,

12:22.208 --> 12:24.948
what am I thinking now?

12:24.949 --> 12:27.487
That you don't even know my name.

12:27.488 --> 12:30.561
Emma Correia.

12:30.562 --> 12:32.165
It's nice to meet you.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.234
I just wish it could have been

12:33.235 --> 12:36.241
under more pleasant circumstances.

12:38.181 --> 12:40.451
I've been an admirer
of Dr. Magnus for years.

12:40.452 --> 12:41.789
Oh, really? When did you meet?

12:41.790 --> 12:43.694
We never have.

12:43.695 --> 12:45.363
Her work saved me.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.168
I've never felt at home anywhere

12:47.169 --> 12:49.206
except the Sanctuary network.

12:49.207 --> 12:52.447
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

12:52.448 --> 12:54.686
How's your investigation going?

12:54.687 --> 12:57.226
Shouldn't you know already?

12:58.495 --> 13:00.033
Actually, no.

13:00.034 --> 13:01.502
It's not an exact science, Will.

13:01.503 --> 13:02.571
The mind is tricky,

13:02.572 --> 13:04.543
and to read it takes focus,

13:04.544 --> 13:06.648
concentration, proximity,

13:06.649 --> 13:08.185
you know, and even then,

13:08.186 --> 13:09.388
a person's thoughts aren't always

13:09.389 --> 13:10.825
out there in the open.

13:10.826 --> 13:12.428
That's why there's three of us.

13:12.429 --> 13:15.136
Doesn't it get noisy
with all the, you know...

13:15.137 --> 13:17.307
Luckily, we can shield our thoughts

13:17.308 --> 13:18.510
drom each other.

13:18.511 --> 13:21.250
It helps us to remain objective.

13:21.251 --> 13:23.388
Huh...

13:23.389 --> 13:25.493
Well, just...

13:25.494 --> 13:27.498
I wish I could get Magnus
to remember what happened.

13:27.499 --> 13:29.736
We'll be questioning her
later on this afternoon.

13:29.737 --> 13:30.873
You're welcome to sit in.

13:30.874 --> 13:31.875
Yeah.

13:31.876 --> 13:35.250
Yeah, I'd like that.

13:40.531 --> 13:43.269
I'm... flattered, Will.

13:46.678 --> 13:48.515
This is going to be tough.

13:53.261 --> 13:54.396
Is this going to upset me?

13:54.397 --> 13:55.566
Oh, yeah, it's bad news.

13:55.567 --> 13:56.601
You know that video you
wanted me to look at?

13:56.602 --> 13:58.105
Yeah.

13:58.106 --> 13:59.441
It's been deleted from
the police database.

13:59.442 --> 14:01.646
So someone on the police
force is gunning for Magnus?

14:01.647 --> 14:03.451
Well, that's what I thought, too,

14:03.452 --> 14:04.587
so I did some digging.

14:04.588 --> 14:05.623
It turns out

14:05.624 --> 14:07.527
The chief deleted it himself.

14:07.528 --> 14:08.898
The chief?

14:08.899 --> 14:10.301
Well, why would he do that?

14:10.302 --> 14:11.337
He and Magnus are old friends.

14:11.338 --> 14:12.540
Exactly.

14:12.541 --> 14:13.675
So...

14:13.676 --> 14:14.879
I hacked into his email account.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.482
Oh, boy.

14:16.483 --> 14:18.554
Don't worry, it's
completely untraceable,

14:18.555 --> 14:20.492
but look what I found.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.996
That is an email

14:21.997 --> 14:23.833
requesting the file be deleted.

14:27.710 --> 14:29.314
From Magnus.

14:34.861 --> 14:35.895
What?

14:51.902 --> 14:55.443
Okay, Remy. You got your money.

14:55.444 --> 14:59.487
Now, what have you heard?

14:59.488 --> 15:02.126
Your boss has been very busy lately.

15:02.127 --> 15:04.331
Meaning?

15:04.332 --> 15:06.002
I tracked down this dealer,

15:06.003 --> 15:08.808
and he said that she bought
a whack of red-list freaks

15:08.809 --> 15:10.011
last week.

15:10.012 --> 15:11.448
Red-list?

15:11.449 --> 15:12.551
Are you sure?

15:12.552 --> 15:13.720
Oh, yeah.

15:13.721 --> 15:15.124
According to him,

15:15.125 --> 15:18.665
she was all over the
weird, creepy stuff.

15:18.666 --> 15:19.901
Stuff nobody else wants.

15:19.902 --> 15:21.405
What exactly did she buy?

15:22.776 --> 15:24.513
Wouldn't tell me.

15:24.514 --> 15:26.718
Didn't want to rat out a client,

15:26.719 --> 15:29.592
but whatever it was,
she paid a lot for it.

15:29.593 --> 15:30.928
Way over market.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.504
That doesn't make any sense.

15:34.505 --> 15:36.842
What would Magnus want
with a bunch of red-Listers?

15:36.843 --> 15:37.979
Nothing legal.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.797
Shall we begin?

16:02.705 --> 16:05.812
I'm going to ask you to open your mind

16:05.813 --> 16:08.486
and allow us inside.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.015
Do you know why we're here?

16:21.016 --> 16:22.252
You're the triad, Emma.

16:22.253 --> 16:24.290
You're here to interrogate me.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.194
We don't want you to
think of it that way.

16:26.195 --> 16:29.636
This is an important matter,

16:29.637 --> 16:30.972
but you are still innocent

16:30.973 --> 16:33.010
until proven otherwise.

16:33.011 --> 16:35.283
Now, three nights ago,

16:35.284 --> 16:36.753
there was an incident in old city.

16:36.754 --> 16:40.128
Do you remember it?

16:40.129 --> 16:41.164
No.

16:46.778 --> 16:50.152
One of your oldest friends was killed.

16:51.256 --> 16:54.128
I don't remember.

16:54.129 --> 16:55.666
Do you remember going into the alley

16:55.667 --> 16:56.768
and firing your weapon?

16:56.769 --> 16:58.739
I can't...

16:58.740 --> 17:01.379
I don't know what happened.

17:11.839 --> 17:12.973
What is your relationship like

17:12.973 --> 17:14.042
With your staff?

17:21.963 --> 17:22.930
99 I didn't do this.

17:22.931 --> 17:24.200
Please,

17:24.201 --> 17:25.169
Just answer the questions.

17:26.742 --> 17:29.748
Why are you treating me
like a common criminal?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.819
This investigation is in accordance

17:31.820 --> 17:32.688
with your charter...

17:32.689 --> 17:34.024
someone did this to me,

17:34.025 --> 17:35.059
and you're all just sitting here

17:35.060 --> 17:38.167
instead of trying to find them!

17:40.072 --> 17:42.912
You're all in on this, aren't you?

17:48.259 --> 17:50.764
You've done something to me.

17:50.765 --> 17:51.901
- Magnus...
- No!

17:51.902 --> 17:54.105
No, leave me alone, all of you!

17:54.106 --> 17:55.877
Get out of my house!

17:55.878 --> 17:57.414
Okay, this is over.

17:57.415 --> 17:59.117
We can reconvene later.

18:07.339 --> 18:10.479
Her mind is chaotic, damaged.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.851
I've seen this type of thing before.

18:12.852 --> 18:14.455
Symptoms of advanced dementia.

18:14.456 --> 18:16.494
It makes it impossible
to read her thoughts,

18:16.495 --> 18:18.097
even with basic prompts to focus them.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.367
W... what does that mean?

18:19.368 --> 18:22.440
Telepathy is our most reliable
means of investigation,

18:22.441 --> 18:23.577
but it's not the only one.

18:23.578 --> 18:24.980
We'll need to look over

18:24.981 --> 18:26.618
the existing physical evidence

18:26.619 --> 18:27.988
until we can understand

18:27.989 --> 18:29.223
why we can't read her mind.

18:29.224 --> 18:31.396
Will, I'm... I'm sorry.

18:31.397 --> 18:33.299
I know you were hoping for better news.

18:39.181 --> 18:40.852
Hey, you wanted to see me?

18:40.853 --> 18:42.857
Yeah.

18:42.858 --> 18:45.964
Firewall intercepted an outgoing email.

18:49.908 --> 18:51.043
No way.

19:01.001 --> 19:02.705
What the hell are you trying to pull?

19:02.706 --> 19:03.940
Sorry?

19:03.941 --> 19:04.910
You sent an email

19:04.911 --> 19:06.212
to the heads of household

19:06.213 --> 19:07.181
requesting to be put in charge

19:07.182 --> 19:08.350
of this Sanctuary.

19:08.351 --> 19:09.386
You read my email?

19:09.387 --> 19:10.724
You're trying to discrrdit Magnus

19:10.725 --> 19:11.626
before the triad renders judgment

19:11.627 --> 19:12.929
because you want her job.

19:12.930 --> 19:14.365
Watch yourself, mate,
you're out of line.

19:14.366 --> 19:15.636
I'm out of line?

19:15.637 --> 19:16.939
You're making an end run around her,

19:16.940 --> 19:18.274
but I'm the one who's out of line?

19:18.275 --> 19:21.115
You realize what'll happen
if she's found guilty?

19:21.116 --> 19:23.286
There's a list of candidates
a mile long to take her place,

19:23.287 --> 19:24.657
And let me tell you,

19:24.658 --> 19:26.027
none of them will be as
pleasant to work for as me.

19:26.028 --> 19:27.063
For starters,

19:27.064 --> 19:28.198
they'll fire the whole staff,

19:28.199 --> 19:30.137
You included.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.110
And a year from now,

19:33.111 --> 19:35.248
if her memory clears up
and she's found not guilty,

19:35.249 --> 19:37.154
I'm more than happy to step down,

19:37.155 --> 19:39.092
let her take command again.

19:39.093 --> 19:40.662
That's more than I can
say for anyone else.

19:40.663 --> 19:42.299
You have no idea

19:42.300 --> 19:44.437
of the political landscape
you're dealing with.

19:44.438 --> 19:46.008
I want a copy

19:46.009 --> 19:48.414
Of all the evidence
you've collected so far.

19:48.415 --> 19:49.718
Oh, you think I'm
fabricating this, do you?

19:49.719 --> 19:50.753
Yeah.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.058
Hello?

19:53.059 --> 19:54.061
Heyy it's me.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.698
I got the video from the alley.

19:55.699 --> 19:57.770
It's downloading now.

19:57.771 --> 19:59.808
Good, we'll be right there.

19:59.809 --> 20:02.448
Turns out the police
maintain a backup database.

20:02.449 --> 20:04.085
It's only updated every three days,

20:04.086 --> 20:05.655
so there's some lag time
between the main system and...

20:05.656 --> 20:08.362
Yeah, yeah, I... I get it.

20:08.363 --> 20:11.236
So, what do you got?

20:13.341 --> 20:15.846
Can you fast forward a bit?

20:18.254 --> 20:19.354
Right there.

20:23.166 --> 20:24.868
It looks like he's waiting for someone.

20:29.815 --> 20:31.550
Oh. There.

20:31.551 --> 20:33.422
Dammit, who is that?

20:48.592 --> 20:49.694
Aw, come on, turnnaround.

21:18.565 --> 21:20.168
Come in.

21:22.341 --> 21:23.642
Scofield.

21:23.643 --> 21:24.845
Have a seat.

21:24.846 --> 21:26.215
It's not necessary.

21:26.216 --> 21:27.285
I just wanted to inform you,

21:27.286 --> 21:28.588
my colleagues and I

21:28.589 --> 21:29.556
have gone through the evidence,

21:29.557 --> 21:32.330
Discussed the issue at length.

21:32.331 --> 21:33.566
Let me guess.

21:33.567 --> 21:37.109
Dr. Magnus has a mental deficiency.

21:37.110 --> 21:38.211
She needs treatment.

21:38.212 --> 21:39.481
She's a hazard to herself

21:39.482 --> 21:40.483
and others.

21:40.484 --> 21:41.785
She's being set up.

21:41.786 --> 21:42.687
How can you still believe that?

21:42.688 --> 21:44.459
You've seen the video.

21:44.460 --> 21:47.700
I don't care about the video.

21:47.701 --> 21:50.674
I don't care what anyone
says, telepathic or otherwise.

21:52.579 --> 21:56.422
I see you may not agree with
our methods, Dr. Zimmerman,

21:56.423 --> 21:57.758
but I can assure you they're effective,

21:57.759 --> 21:58.927
and there's a good reason

21:58.928 --> 22:00.364
Dr. Magnus assigned this task

22:00.365 --> 22:01.600
to our kind.

22:01.601 --> 22:02.770
So what happens now?

22:02.771 --> 22:05.544
In the interim,

22:05.545 --> 22:07.748
Declan macrae will be
assuming responsibilities

22:07.749 --> 22:09.219
of this Sanctuary.

22:09.220 --> 22:10.421
I know that you believe

22:10.422 --> 22:13.429
he's somehow connected to Magnus' crime,

22:13.430 --> 22:14.465
but I can assure you

22:14.466 --> 22:15.667
that's not true.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.639
I have questioned him fully

22:17.640 --> 22:18.941
And read his mind.

22:18.942 --> 22:20.378
Yeah, well...

22:20.379 --> 22:25.224
A lot of good that did Magnus.

22:26.661 --> 22:27.896
You know, I'm sorry

22:27.897 --> 22:30.269
that you're disappointed, doctor,

22:30.270 --> 22:31.773
but really, it's for the best.

22:32.943 --> 22:34.012
Now, Dr. Magnus will be transported

22:34.013 --> 22:35.281
first thing in the morning.

22:35.282 --> 22:37.920
I suggest you take the
opportunity to say goodbye

22:37.921 --> 22:38.957
before then.

22:42.299 --> 22:43.568
You can't let them do this to me.

22:43.569 --> 22:44.604
We're doing everything we can

22:44.605 --> 22:45.606
to get you out of here.

22:45.607 --> 22:46.675
Henry is pulling out all the stops.

22:46.676 --> 22:47.678
Kate is talking to...

22:47.679 --> 22:48.680
No, you don't understand.

22:48.681 --> 22:50.385
They're all out to get me!

22:50.386 --> 22:51.921
Who?

22:51.922 --> 22:53.325
Declan,

22:53.326 --> 22:54.861
And that other one,
what's his name, Scofield.

22:54.862 --> 22:56.800
- They're working together.
- How do you know?

22:56.801 --> 22:58.437
Isn't it obvious?

22:58.438 --> 23:00.842
Will, they're trying to kill me!

23:00.843 --> 23:01.912
Look.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.349
Look at this.

23:03.350 --> 23:04.451
It's poisoned.

23:04.452 --> 23:05.654
Smell it.

23:05.655 --> 23:06.489
Smell it!

23:08.763 --> 23:11.736
They're going to destroy everything.

23:11.737 --> 23:13.506
Ashley told me.

23:13.507 --> 23:14.776
Magnus, this has nothing to do

23:14.777 --> 23:15.778
with Ashley.

23:15.779 --> 23:16.948
They killed her too!

23:16.949 --> 23:18.017
They killed my daughter!

23:18.018 --> 23:19.921
Okay, listen to me.

23:19.922 --> 23:22.996
You're exhausted. You need to rest.

23:22.997 --> 23:24.600
Don't patronize me.

23:24.601 --> 23:26.471
You said you were going to help me.

23:26.472 --> 23:27.574
I am trying to help you.

23:29.413 --> 23:30.915
Oh, no.

23:30.916 --> 23:31.917
What?

23:31.918 --> 23:34.457
Oh, no...

23:34.458 --> 23:35.593
they got to you too.

23:35.594 --> 23:38.867
No, look, I swear, I
am fighting for you.

23:38.868 --> 23:40.137
You're lying!

23:40.138 --> 23:44.515
Why is everyone lying to me?

24:07.035 --> 24:08.573
Dr. Magnus?

24:22.841 --> 24:24.310
Zimmerman!

24:24.311 --> 24:27.050
Henry, I need an immediate
perimeter lockdown.

24:27.051 --> 24:28.721
Uh, yeah, you're too late.

24:28.722 --> 24:32.530
She's already gone.

24:32.531 --> 24:35.604
Fisher, take collins and go after her.

24:35.605 --> 24:36.941
What the hell were
you doing here, anyway?

24:36.942 --> 24:39.079
We were just talking.

24:45.261 --> 24:46.597
Where are you on Magnus' files?

24:46.598 --> 24:48.267
Still scratching the surface, why?

24:48.268 --> 24:50.272
There's something in
there that Declan wants.

24:50.273 --> 24:51.676
I mean, think about it.

24:51.677 --> 24:52.979
He knew exactly what he had to do

24:52.980 --> 24:54.282
to discredit Magnus,

24:54.283 --> 24:55.652
and now that she's out of the picture,

24:55.653 --> 24:57.322
he can take his time, go
through the files one by one.

24:57.323 --> 24:58.258
Yeah, but wouldn't the telepaths know

24:58.259 --> 24:59.127
what he was up to?

24:59.128 --> 25:01.232
Not if one of them's in on it.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.569
Aw, you think?

25:02.570 --> 25:03.705
One of them could be

25:03.706 --> 25:05.643
blocking the other two
from reading his mind.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.850
Telepathic criminal, great.

25:08.851 --> 25:09.953
I know.

25:09.954 --> 25:11.624
Hey.

25:11.625 --> 25:13.261
Meet me at the pier in 20.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.168
Hello?

25:35.014 --> 25:36.083
I had to get you

25:36.084 --> 25:37.218
out of the range of the telepaths

25:37.219 --> 25:39.256
before I brought you here.

25:39.257 --> 25:40.426
What is this place?

25:40.427 --> 25:43.133
Storage facility.

25:43.134 --> 25:47.009
Part of the university
before they shut it down.

25:47.010 --> 25:49.014
My guy swears

25:49.015 --> 25:52.723
he spotted her coming in.

25:52.724 --> 25:54.226
Magnus?

25:54.227 --> 25:56.231
Doc?

25:56.232 --> 25:59.271
Are you down here?

25:59.272 --> 26:00.474
Magnus, it's Will and Kate.

26:03.751 --> 26:04.818
H... h... hold on a second!

26:04.819 --> 26:06.122
Leave me alone! Stay back!

26:06.123 --> 26:07.258
We don't want to hurt you.

26:07.259 --> 26:10.031
We're here to help you.

26:11.501 --> 26:12.871
Come on, Magnus.

26:12.872 --> 26:16.245
Now, you already knocked
me out once today.

26:16.246 --> 26:19.453
One per day, that's your limit.

26:22.495 --> 26:24.332
Will?

26:36.061 --> 26:39.568
What's happening to me?

26:39.569 --> 26:44.280
Magnus, let me help you.

26:49.293 --> 26:50.896
No, that can't be right.

26:54.505 --> 26:57.078
What the..?

26:58.047 --> 26:59.951
Oh, yeah?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.855
Try this one on for size.

27:04.864 --> 27:06.867
Oh, come on.

27:17.929 --> 27:21.101
Oh, man.

27:22.505 --> 27:23.908
We're not leaving her here.

27:24.946 --> 27:26.481
Well, you can't take her back there.

27:31.328 --> 27:32.997
Henry, what's going on?

27:32.998 --> 27:34.567
Hey, I kind of hit the motherlode here.

27:34.568 --> 27:36.104
Where are you?

27:36.105 --> 27:37.341
I'll be right there... Ow! What?

27:37.342 --> 27:38.643
Hello, mcfly?

27:38.644 --> 27:39.947
You can't go back there.

27:39.948 --> 27:41.217
The amazing Kreskins will read your mind

27:41.218 --> 27:42.319
and find out where Magnus is.

27:44.592 --> 27:45.660
What's going on?

27:45.661 --> 27:47.198
H... hello?

27:47.199 --> 27:49.603
Henry, can you meet me at dead bridge?

27:49.604 --> 27:51.040
Yeah, why?

27:51.041 --> 27:52.544
I can't tell you.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.682
Okay, I have no idea what that means.

27:54.683 --> 27:57.122
Good. Okay.

27:57.123 --> 27:58.625
Smooth.

28:00.230 --> 28:02.501
H... hello?

28:02.502 --> 28:04.239
Bye.

28:08.082 --> 28:10.554
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

28:26.627 --> 28:28.130
So I was going through her backup drive

28:28.131 --> 28:30.167
when I stumbled across a ghost directory

28:30.168 --> 28:31.404
labeled "Big Bertha."

28:31.405 --> 28:34.344
I tried to open it, and I found this.

28:34.345 --> 28:35.514
What is this?

28:35.515 --> 28:37.084
Some sort of encryption cipher.

28:37.085 --> 28:38.287
Csis-level coding,

28:38.288 --> 28:40.159
so whatever's in there's
got to be important.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.695
And you think this is
what Declan's after?

28:41.696 --> 28:43.700
I'd say it's a fair bet.

28:43.701 --> 28:45.271
"Big Bertha"?

28:45.272 --> 28:46.440
Does that mean anything to you?

28:46.441 --> 28:47.809
No.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.881
All right, stay on it.

28:49.882 --> 28:51.118
Let me know what you find out.

28:51.119 --> 28:52.455
Yeah. You got it.

29:03.182 --> 29:04.417
How did it go?

29:04.418 --> 29:05.652
Good.

29:05.653 --> 29:07.357
Henry thinks he's found something, so...

29:08.561 --> 29:10.298
Magnus!

29:10.299 --> 29:12.536
Put it down, Miss Freelander.

29:12.537 --> 29:13.706
Right now!

29:13.707 --> 29:15.210
You brought them here?

29:15.211 --> 29:16.546
No. No, it wasn't me.

29:16.547 --> 29:17.548
Actually, it was.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.884
What the hell is this?

29:18.885 --> 29:20.388
I could very well ask
you the same question.

29:20.389 --> 29:24.565
Dr. Magnus, you are hereby
remanded into custody.

29:24.566 --> 29:25.434
You'll come quietly, please.

29:25.435 --> 29:26.703
No. No!

29:26.704 --> 29:27.472
No!

29:28.976 --> 29:30.212
No! Get your hands off me! Let go of me!

29:30.213 --> 29:31.649
Hey, take it easy!

29:31.650 --> 29:33.554
Let go of me!

29:33.555 --> 29:34.889
She's becoming more dangerous.

29:34.890 --> 29:36.961
It's time to take extreme measures.

29:36.962 --> 29:38.832
Confine her in the shoe.

29:38.833 --> 29:39.935
Maximum security.

29:39.936 --> 29:43.243
Will! Will!

29:48.089 --> 29:50.026
You made a very big mistake, mate.

29:50.027 --> 29:53.100
We're not the enemy.

29:55.807 --> 29:57.677
What do you know about Big Bertha?

30:01.086 --> 30:02.255
Your silence won't help you,

30:02.256 --> 30:03.658
Dr. Zimmerman.

30:03.659 --> 30:05.095
You can't control your thoughts.

30:05.096 --> 30:06.531
Stop it, Scofield.

30:06.532 --> 30:07.802
You know as well as I do

30:07.803 --> 30:09.338
He knows nothing.

30:09.339 --> 30:12.146
Will, I can assure you
there is no conspiracy here.

30:12.147 --> 30:13.816
How do you know?

30:13.817 --> 30:15.052
You said yourself

30:15.053 --> 30:16.689
You can't read each
other's thoughts, so-

30:16.690 --> 30:18.494
We can read his, Dr. Zimmerman.

30:18.495 --> 30:20.098
And yours.

30:20.099 --> 30:21.836
Harboring a fugitive is a serious crime

30:21.837 --> 30:23.406
Under the Sanctuary charter, doctor.

30:23.407 --> 30:24.843
So you want to lock me up, too?

30:24.844 --> 30:27.315
Go ahead.

30:30.424 --> 30:33.697
Will, wait.

30:33.698 --> 30:34.800
Look, I want to apologize

30:34.801 --> 30:35.902
for the way Scofield treated you.

30:35.903 --> 30:37.506
You didn't deserve that.

30:37.507 --> 30:39.510
The emergence of
information on Big Bertha

30:39.511 --> 30:40.848
has everybody rattled.

30:40.849 --> 30:42.351
What the hell is Big Bertha anyway?

30:45.426 --> 30:48.166
Oh...

30:48.167 --> 30:49.569
I get it.

30:49.570 --> 30:52.776
So you get to know
all my inner thoughts,

30:52.777 --> 30:54.313
but when it comes to telling me

30:54.314 --> 30:56.218
why I'm being treated like a criminal,

30:56.219 --> 30:57.354
then everything's off limits, huh?

30:57.355 --> 30:59.392
Look, all right...

31:02.701 --> 31:05.407
But what I'm about to tell
you is heavily classified.

31:05.408 --> 31:08.547
Only a handful of people
in the world know it.

31:08.548 --> 31:10.652
Fine.

31:12.224 --> 31:13.592
As you know,

31:13.593 --> 31:15.497
we house many species
of deadly abnormals

31:15.498 --> 31:17.303
within the network.

31:17.304 --> 31:19.441
Normally, this isn't a problem,

31:19.442 --> 31:21.913
provided certain precautions are taken.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.486
However, there are certain abnormals

31:24.487 --> 31:25.822
that are so dangerous,

31:25.823 --> 31:27.260
we simply can't risk
keeping them around.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.329
How dangerous?

31:28.330 --> 31:30.935
Earthquakes, mass flooding,

31:30.936 --> 31:32.605
fires, atmospheric toxins,

31:32.606 --> 31:33.908
and believe me,

31:33.909 --> 31:35.279
the list of what these
abnormals are capable of

31:35.280 --> 31:36.481
goes on.

31:36.482 --> 31:40.424
Big bertha was one such abnormal.

31:40.425 --> 31:43.564
She could alter the magnetic
resonance in her body

31:43.565 --> 31:45.871
to manipulate tectonic plates.

31:45.872 --> 31:47.741
The destruction she caused

31:47.742 --> 31:49.212
was unimaginable.

31:49.213 --> 31:53.088
Dr. Magnus tracked,
captured, and euthanized her

31:53.089 --> 31:54.458
according to protocol,

31:54.459 --> 31:55.693
or so everybody thought,

31:55.694 --> 31:58.000
but now these files indicate

31:58.001 --> 32:00.539
that Big Bertha may
still actually be alive.

32:00.540 --> 32:02.076
I'm sure you can understand

32:02.077 --> 32:03.680
how unsafe that is.

32:03.681 --> 32:05.518
Whoever controls her

32:05.519 --> 32:07.689
has the power to ransom governments,

32:07.690 --> 32:08.825
level entire cities...

32:08.826 --> 32:10.664
let me explain something to you.

32:10.665 --> 32:11.966
I know Magnus.

32:11.967 --> 32:13.170
I work with her every day.

32:13.171 --> 32:14.440
There's no way that
she would ever unleash

32:14.441 --> 32:15.475
something like this.

32:15.476 --> 32:16.778
There was a time

32:16.779 --> 32:19.685
When I would have believed
you without question, Will,

32:19.686 --> 32:21.823
but now I'm not so sure.

32:34.688 --> 32:35.824
I thought you said you had it.

32:35.825 --> 32:36.926
Yeah, I did, I just...

32:36.927 --> 32:38.163
It's a lot different

32:38.164 --> 32:41.103
with you guys standing
over me like this.

32:44.646 --> 32:47.786
There.

32:47.787 --> 32:49.590
There's your Big Bertha file.

32:49.591 --> 32:51.629
Oh, my God. She's alive.

32:51.630 --> 32:52.765
Not only that,

32:52.766 --> 32:53.900
Magnus is moving her.

32:53.901 --> 32:54.569
Where?

32:54.570 --> 32:55.738
It just says

32:55.739 --> 32:56.840
She's in a container on the arabian sea.

32:56.841 --> 32:58.646
Look at the latest AIS data.

32:58.647 --> 33:00.149
What is she thinking?

33:00.150 --> 33:01.452
We need to mobilize

33:01.453 --> 33:02.889
the nearest Sanctuary
retrieval team immediately.

33:02.890 --> 33:04.794
If Big Bertha falls
into the wrong hands,

33:04.795 --> 33:05.829
it'll be disastrous.

33:07.201 --> 33:08.703
I'll make the arrangements.

33:11.912 --> 33:13.146
Still think she's innocent?

33:35.802 --> 33:37.706
I understand that you're leaving.

33:37.707 --> 33:39.978
May I ask why?

33:39.979 --> 33:41.750
Well, you know already.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.759
You feel that remaining here

33:45.760 --> 33:47.830
will put constraints on your ability

33:47.831 --> 33:49.367
to exonerate Dr. Magnus.

33:49.368 --> 33:52.174
Will, I admire your loyalty,

33:52.175 --> 33:53.444
but there comes a time

33:53.445 --> 33:55.014
when you have to put your emotions aside

33:55.015 --> 33:56.852
and face the logic of the situation.

33:56.853 --> 33:59.391
You think it's logical

33:59.392 --> 34:01.262
that she would shoot her lifelong friend

34:01.263 --> 34:02.366
In cold blood,

34:02.367 --> 34:04.771
that she would lie for years

34:04.772 --> 34:06.107
about harboring a deadly abnormal,

34:06.108 --> 34:07.378
and then send it on a pleasure cruise

34:07.379 --> 34:08.715
across the East African coast?

34:08.716 --> 34:09.949
You think that's logical?

34:09.951 --> 34:11.755
She's sick, Will.

34:11.755 --> 34:12.857
She's not herself.

34:12.858 --> 34:14.193
Right, I... I forgot.

34:14.194 --> 34:16.967
The mysterious
degenerative brain disease.

34:16.967 --> 34:20.040
Look, I know you're hurting.

34:20.041 --> 34:22.213
I feel the same way.

34:23.918 --> 34:26.356
Then why are you leaving?

34:28.094 --> 34:31.435
Well, because our work is done.

34:31.436 --> 34:33.808
The evidence speaks for itself, and...

34:36.047 --> 34:38.385
at least we found Big Bertha

34:38.386 --> 34:40.389
before something terrible happened.

34:46.237 --> 34:49.143
Well, goodbye, Will.

34:49.145 --> 34:54.223
I'm sorry that we ended up
on the opposite sides of this.

35:29.509 --> 35:32.114
Magnus...

35:35.658 --> 35:37.226
I don't know if you can hear me...

35:39.199 --> 35:42.105
or if you even care anymore...

35:44.244 --> 35:47.552
I just came to say goodbye.

35:49.423 --> 35:51.360
I'm sorry this happened.

35:51.361 --> 35:56.005
And I'm sorry I let you down,

35:56.006 --> 35:57.408
but I want you to know

35:57.409 --> 35:59.379
that I'm going to keep
searching for the truth

35:59.380 --> 36:01.619
as long as I can.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.092
I just...

36:04.093 --> 36:05.729
I can't do it from here anymore.

36:09.505 --> 36:11.308
Magnus?

36:11.309 --> 36:12.712
Magnus!

36:12.713 --> 36:15.686
I need help down here!

36:19.629 --> 36:20.998
We put her in a drug-induced coma

36:20.999 --> 36:22.702
to stop the seizures.

36:22.703 --> 36:24.038
I'm afraid her condition

36:24.039 --> 36:25.709
is accelerating.

36:25.710 --> 36:28.850
It doesn't look good.

36:30.488 --> 36:31.590
I'm sorry.

36:37.003 --> 36:39.007
Now, there's more bad news.

36:39.008 --> 36:41.079
We just got word from
our retrieval team.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.986
The ship we were tracking
was attacked by mercenaries.

36:43.987 --> 36:45.891
By the time we boarded it,

36:45.892 --> 36:48.497
the cargo had been stolen.

36:48.498 --> 36:51.605
Big bertha's gone.

37:17.768 --> 37:22.077
None of this makes any sense.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.768
They've voted to send in a triad.

37:59.769 --> 38:01.506
When we're beginning an investigation,

38:01.507 --> 38:03.545
it's really very hard not
to read everyone's thoughts.

38:03.546 --> 38:05.683
Telepathic criminal, great.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.587
If Big Bertha falls
into the wrong hands,

38:07.588 --> 38:08.757
it'll be disastrous.

38:08.758 --> 38:10.293
So far, all the evidence I've gathered

38:10.294 --> 38:12.265
points to Helen Magnus.

38:14.237 --> 38:16.074
Oh, my God.

38:23.794 --> 38:24.963
Where's the triad?

38:24.964 --> 38:26.299
They left hours ago, why?

38:26.300 --> 38:27.970
All right, we've got to
run a scan on Magnus' brain

38:27.971 --> 38:29.272
right now.

38:29.273 --> 38:30.877
Big guy's not dead.

38:32.616 --> 38:34.184
This can't be right.

38:34.185 --> 38:35.755
Where's the deterioration?

38:35.756 --> 38:36.790
It never existed.

38:36.791 --> 38:38.160
Those other brain scans weren't real.

38:38.161 --> 38:39.230
Then why did she flake out?

38:39.231 --> 38:40.265
I don't know,

38:40.266 --> 38:41.702
but I'm guessing she did it on purpose

38:41.703 --> 38:44.108
to conceal her thoughts from the triad.

38:44.109 --> 38:46.147
Okay, so you're Magnus,

38:46.148 --> 38:47.751
and you want to create these symptoms.

38:47.752 --> 38:48.921
What do you do?

38:48.922 --> 38:50.189
I don't follow you.

38:50.190 --> 38:51.392
Is there a type of abnormal

38:51.393 --> 38:53.264
that would cause her to act this way?

38:53.265 --> 38:54.299
Ozone beetle.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.369
What, are you crazy?

38:55.370 --> 38:57.173
Right there on the scan, the dark spot.

38:57.174 --> 38:58.710
What's an ozone beetle?

38:58.711 --> 38:59.980
It's a bug that crawls into your brain

38:59.981 --> 39:01.785
And nests in your
hippocampus, but they're...

39:01.786 --> 39:03.722
red-listed.

39:03.723 --> 39:06.161
The dealer she met last week.

39:06.162 --> 39:07.565
What does it do?

39:07.566 --> 39:09.937
It secretes this fluid that
gives you this wicked high,

39:09.938 --> 39:11.709
but if you leave it in there too long...

39:11.710 --> 39:13.178
It causes memory loss, paranoia,

39:13.179 --> 39:14.247
increased sensitivity to light.

39:14.248 --> 39:16.887
Which is why she hid in the basement.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.457
Okay, we've got to get it out of her.

39:18.458 --> 39:19.661
All right, I'll go get a room ready.

39:21.767 --> 39:23.002
Why would she do this?

39:24.707 --> 39:25.943
Do you still have that email

39:25.944 --> 39:27.045
that she sent you last week?

39:27.046 --> 39:29.117
Yeah, I think so.

39:30.454 --> 39:32.291
There.

39:34.329 --> 39:36.200
Right there.

39:37.471 --> 39:39.375
She spelled "retrieve" wrong.

39:39.376 --> 39:40.510
So?

39:40.511 --> 39:42.148
No, Magnus is a spelling nazi.

39:42.149 --> 39:43.217
She'd never do that.

39:43.218 --> 39:45.021
Five minutes ago I would have thought

39:45.022 --> 39:46.124
she'd never put a bug
in her head, either.

39:49.834 --> 39:50.903
Whoa...

39:50.904 --> 39:51.938
What the hell is that?

39:51.939 --> 39:54.143
Africa.

39:56.984 --> 40:01.461
I think we just found Big Bertha.

40:25.419 --> 40:27.390
We took the ship yesterday.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.027
They gave up the cargo
with no resistance.

40:29.028 --> 40:30.598
Good.

40:30.599 --> 40:31.934
We'll need to move it again
to our more secure location

40:31.935 --> 40:33.939
before the Sanctuary picks up the trail.

40:33.940 --> 40:35.042
There is a truck standing by.

40:38.418 --> 40:39.385
Ouvrez-le, vite, vite!

40:39.386 --> 40:41.390
Some things are simply too powerful

40:41.391 --> 40:42.426
to be left in the wrong hands.

40:59.568 --> 41:02.540
It's a tracking device.

41:05.182 --> 41:06.550
Freeze! Hold it!

41:07.621 --> 41:09.358
Don't move!

41:13.067 --> 41:14.536
Move it!

41:14.537 --> 41:16.208
Come on, let's go.

41:22.323 --> 41:23.591
Can you read my mind now?

41:26.333 --> 41:29.372
Big bertha's dead.

41:29.373 --> 41:33.249
I'm sorry we ended up on
opposite sides of this.

41:46.414 --> 41:48.385
Okay, so let me get this straight.

41:48.386 --> 41:50.089
You knew Emma was bad news

41:50.090 --> 41:51.292
from day one?

41:51.293 --> 41:53.097
Day one might be pushing it,

41:53.098 --> 41:54.332
but over the past few years,

41:54.333 --> 41:56.170
I'd noticed a series
of information leaks

41:56.171 --> 41:57.640
that couldn't be traced
back to the Cabal.

41:57.641 --> 42:00.714
So you came up with this insane plan

42:00.715 --> 42:02.386
to dangle Big Bertha in front of her.

42:02.387 --> 42:03.687
Drop an ozone beetle

42:03.688 --> 42:05.125
to take yourself out of the picture.

42:05.126 --> 42:06.729
Kill the big guy,

42:06.730 --> 42:08.199
which I'm still not entirely
sure about, by the way.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.469
And not tell any of us,

42:09.470 --> 42:10.604
so that we couldn't blow your cover.

42:10.605 --> 42:12.108
Quite simple, really.

42:12.109 --> 42:13.345
Oh, yeah.

42:13.346 --> 42:14.681
Yeah, yeah, it's totally simple.

42:14.682 --> 42:15.650
Okay, so spill.

42:15.651 --> 42:17.154
What is the gag on the big guy?

42:17.155 --> 42:19.560
The subcutaneous fascial layer

42:19.561 --> 42:20.996
of his species

42:20.997 --> 42:22.199
is four times thicker
than that of humans.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.436
The bullets didn't penetrate.

42:23.437 --> 42:25.274
But henry examined him.

42:25.275 --> 42:26.342
I mean, he was dead.

42:26.343 --> 42:27.512
In a manner of speaking.

42:27.513 --> 42:29.249
I tipped the bullets

42:29.250 --> 42:31.489
with the secretion of
a chilean shepherd frog.

42:31.490 --> 42:33.226
It slowed his heart
enough to feign death.

42:33.227 --> 42:35.698
Oh, my God, oh, my God, you're crazy.

42:35.699 --> 42:36.767
You're certifiably crazy.

42:36.768 --> 42:38.371
I should have let them take you away.

42:38.372 --> 42:39.608
Nonsense.

42:39.609 --> 42:41.378
I knew you'd figure it out.

42:41.379 --> 42:43.350
Besides, I'd left careful instructions

42:43.351 --> 42:44.920
to call the whole thing
off in two days' time

42:44.921 --> 42:46.458
if things went badly.

42:46.459 --> 42:47.560
The big guy.

42:47.561 --> 42:49.197
Huh...

42:49.198 --> 42:51.837
Speaking of which,
shouldn't he be back by now?

42:54.612 --> 42:55.780
Henry.

43:00.259 --> 43:02.964
If you ever do that to me again,

43:02.965 --> 43:05.837
I will shoot you myself, you got it?

43:05.838 --> 43:08.009
Got it.

43:09.882 --> 43:11.652
All right, what are
you standing there for?

43:11.653 --> 43:13.590
Let's go eat lunch.
