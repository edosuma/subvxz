00:04.526 --> 00:07.137
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.137 --> 00:09.835
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.835 --> 00:11.315

00:11.315 --> 00:14.405
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.405 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:20.150 --> 00:21.804
<i>The OCU is shutting down.</i>

00:21.804 --> 00:23.023
This task force was started

00:23.023 --> 00:24.676
because of what happened
to my wife.

00:24.676 --> 00:29.159
<i>I have always done everything
for the good of this unit.</i>

00:29.159 --> 00:30.987
I'm doing this for my family.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.467
We're also your family.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.121
I'm not taking the job, William.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.600
You're making a huge mistake.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.820
<i>My place is here
with my team.</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:40.692
<i>Always has been.</i>

01:00.277 --> 01:01.844
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

01:01.844 --> 01:02.888
Hey, babe.
I can't talk right now.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.542
I'm busy.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.067
Where are you?
I got dinner for us.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.895
I'll be home soon.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.202
Tino, what are you doing?

01:12.202 --> 01:14.552
I'm taking care of us.

01:17.468 --> 01:20.602
I told you
I don't want you to do that.

01:20.602 --> 01:23.561
<i>Tino, please, you're going
to get us both in trouble.</i>

01:23.561 --> 01:26.738
You got to turn around
right now.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.218
<i>Tino.</i>

01:29.350 --> 01:32.092
I can't believe this.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.227
<i>- Tino.</i>
- Babe, I got to jump.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.620
Tino.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.752
Ti--

01:46.193 --> 01:47.933
Pull to the side.

01:47.933 --> 01:50.153
Let's go.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.785
Tino?

02:21.750 --> 02:24.187
Tino, is that you?

02:28.060 --> 02:29.323
Tino?

02:38.419 --> 02:42.205
You have an impressive
and interesting history.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.294
I see you discharged
your weapon

02:44.294 --> 02:46.862
10 times in the line of duty.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.299
Two weeks ago was the 11th.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.216
My question is why.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.176
The guy had a gun pointed
at my sergeant.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.396
Why do you want
to go back to work?

03:02.747 --> 03:05.315
What do you want me to do,
go into retirement?

03:05.315 --> 03:08.449
It's not about what I want.

03:08.449 --> 03:11.191
I have to provide
for my family.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.627
Well, let's talk
about your family.

03:12.627 --> 03:15.934
Let's not.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.240
I understand your wife--

03:17.240 --> 03:20.330
What is it you want
to hear from me?

03:20.330 --> 03:21.723
That's not how this works.

03:21.723 --> 03:25.205
That is exactly
how this works.

03:27.032 --> 03:30.601
I just want to understand
your state of mind.

03:30.601 --> 03:33.169
That's why I don't like this.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.562
I don't like this.

03:34.562 --> 03:37.608
This is required
after firing your weapon.

03:37.608 --> 03:40.524
Mm-hmm.

03:40.524 --> 03:45.877
Detective, I'm here to help.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.271
You want something deeper,
and there's nothing there.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.621
I'm a cop.
There was a situation.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.145
I made a decision.
I did my job.

03:53.145 --> 03:57.019
Now I want to go back to it.

03:57.019 --> 04:02.285
You know, Detective,
I see a lot of cops.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.331
They come in here.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.158
They don't want to talk.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.379
They have this idea that
opening up is weak somehow.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.514
I say to them,
if that's true,

04:13.514 --> 04:16.256
why are you so scared to do it?

04:28.355 --> 04:29.399
I'll approve your RTD.

04:29.399 --> 04:32.272
Thank you.

04:32.272 --> 04:37.712
But just in case.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.844
Thank you.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.342
Detective Stabler.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.126
Hey.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.345
Where?

05:02.345 --> 05:04.826
Where are you?

05:04.826 --> 05:06.175
Listen to me.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.437
Don't talk to anyone.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.700
I'll be right there.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.311
OK.

05:15.576 --> 05:16.794
Can we take these off him?
He's a friend.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.754
I'll take full responsibility.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.414
Tino.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.199
What's going on?

05:30.199 --> 05:32.984
I screwed up.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.159
What do you mean
you screwed up?

05:34.159 --> 05:35.552
What happened?

05:35.552 --> 05:38.250
- These Cubans from Miami--
- Uh-huh.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.991
I went out there last week

05:39.991 --> 05:43.821
to earn some extra money
doing races, you know?

05:43.821 --> 05:47.912
I mean, Sherie planned on
starting a family.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.566
All right.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.960
So I start winning the races,
and this guy walks up to me.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.050
He's like, yo, you wanna
earn some real money driving?

05:55.050 --> 05:57.182
I'm like, what I got to do?

05:57.182 --> 05:59.707
He says just to meet up
with a van in the Bronx.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.491
And all I had to do
was if I see a cop,

06:01.491 --> 06:02.710
run interference.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.712
What was in the van?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.496
I heard them talking
about some kilos,

06:06.496 --> 06:07.845
but look,
I didn't ask no questions.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.848
Tino, look,
I mean, that's serious.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.981
I don't got the sway
to get you out of here.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.592
It's not about that.

06:15.592 --> 06:18.682
They took my wife.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.336
What do you mean
they took Sherie?

06:20.336 --> 06:21.903
The same guy that got
in touch with me out there

06:21.903 --> 06:23.644
got in touch with me here
and said,

06:23.644 --> 06:24.775
they're going to keep her

06:24.775 --> 06:26.255
to make sure
I keep my mouth shut.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.605
- What guy?
- I don't know.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.521
They gonna kill her.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.218
I need your help.
- OK.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.916
I need you to help me.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.006
OK, look, I'ma do everything
in my power to find her.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.401
Everything.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.714
Sergeant Bell?

07:33.714 --> 07:35.237
Deputy Inspector Thurman.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.978
Oh.

07:36.978 --> 07:37.935
Come in.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.720
Nice to meet you.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.156
It's just Ray, by the way.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.114
We can dispense with all
that other formality.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.333
May I call you Ayanna?

07:44.333 --> 07:45.943
Sure, have a seat.

07:45.943 --> 07:46.988
Yeah.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.470
Sorry to just drop in.

07:50.470 --> 07:54.430
I was just so excited to meet
and show my appreciation.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.477
The vacancy that opened up
when you declined the position,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.217
which I really respect,
by the way,

07:59.217 --> 08:03.352
paved the path for me
to move out of IB.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.223
So when they came
to me and said

08:05.223 --> 08:08.488
that I could be working
with Ayanna Bell,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.402
I jumped at the chance.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.492
I've been a big fan
for a while.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.971
How old are you?

08:13.971 --> 08:17.192
I'll be 34 on Easter.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.628
Oh, OK, sorry.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.195
It's all right.
That's all right.

08:20.195 --> 08:24.504
I've heard it my whole life,
as I'm sure you have, too.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.724
Well, Ray, congratulations.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.291
It is great meeting you.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.859
I really look forward
to working together.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.643
Yeah.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.471
Has anyone talked to you
about the new needs

08:35.471 --> 08:37.212
for the department?

08:37.212 --> 08:38.866
What new needs?

08:38.866 --> 08:41.433
Midtown just uncovered
five floors full of asbestos.

08:41.433 --> 08:46.003
We're looking for
some temp space.

08:46.003 --> 08:50.094
You have, what,
five people working here?

08:53.968 --> 08:55.186
Hey.

08:55.186 --> 08:58.494
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends.

08:58.494 --> 09:00.191
- There he is.
- Welcome back.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.279
Well, thanks very much.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.367
Let's not get too excited.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.368
It was just a couple of weeks.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.718
Everyone good?

09:04.718 --> 09:06.371
So you get the info on
the Cuban mafia for me?

09:06.371 --> 09:08.504
Yes, we started with the
database in Florida and--

09:08.504 --> 09:09.592
Elliot, everyone.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.594
I want you to meet someone.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.597
Ray, this is
Detective Elliot Stabler.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.599
Elliot,
Deputy Inspector Thurman,

09:16.599 --> 09:18.470
or you can call him Ray.
- Hey, Ray.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.776
Pleased to meet you, detective.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.300
I've heard so many
wonderful things.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.565
Sure you got the right guy?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.089
I'll get out of your hair.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.091
Have a great day.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.052
Let's make you official.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.016
So Lillian gave up on us?

09:42.016 --> 09:44.540
I will not pretend
to know the politics

09:44.540 --> 09:47.848
that goes down in 1PP.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.593
Welcome back.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.246
It's good to be back.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.508
Are you sure?

09:56.508 --> 09:57.814
I am.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.250
I'd like to get started.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.122
Let's do it.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.776
Sherie Alvarez.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.430
Last known was her apartment
around 8:15 last evening.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.650
Yeah, Jamie and I hit her
gym, checked the cameras,

10:07.650 --> 10:09.304
talked to some
witnesses, nothing.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.567
Put the BOLO out to
Transit Authority and DOT

10:11.567 --> 10:12.916
about an hour ago.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.788
- Any luck with her phone?
- Still working on it.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.181
Tino say anything about
this crew that was involved?

10:17.181 --> 10:19.053
A bunch of young
guns out of Miami,

10:19.053 --> 10:20.750
they're moving product north.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.100
What I do know is they're
into street racing.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.972
You put the best drivers
in these chase cars,

10:24.972 --> 10:26.669
you give them the
best shot at escaping.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.236
We have anybody like
that on our radar?

10:28.236 --> 10:30.281
Maybe there's a connection
to the corporation

10:30.281 --> 10:31.674
in the South Bronx.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.807
I mean, if you're Cuban,
that used to be home base,

10:33.807 --> 10:35.547
that or Hudson County.
- That's a good idea.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.810
I got a connection up there.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.160
You and me,
let's go for a ride.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.296
Is that--

10:45.296 --> 10:46.341
Who's that?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.864
No, can't be.

10:47.864 --> 10:48.865
Oh, Esteban, good to see you.

10:48.865 --> 10:49.910
You look good.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.302
Are you kidding?

10:51.302 --> 10:52.390
I look great.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.349
Who's this one?
- Detective Reyes.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.090
Oh.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.700
Listen, if he don't treat you
right, you let me know, OK?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.441
I'll tune him up.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.921
He's not as tough as he looks.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.487
I need your help.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.794
I need some information on
some young faces out of Miami.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.840
They're probably recent.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.712
They've got a connection
to street racing.

11:12.976 --> 11:16.632
There's a woman missing
who needs help.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.678
That's Tino's wife.

11:22.029 --> 11:25.336
Esteban.
Talk to me.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.469
Esteban.

11:27.469 --> 11:30.690
Boys out of Miami got
people scared, I understand.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.694
Just, who's the man in charge?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.521
I hope you find her.

11:36.521 --> 11:39.046
I do, but, uh,

11:39.046 --> 11:41.701
I've got to protect
my own family.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.238
So how soon can I get paid?

11:57.238 --> 11:58.761
Well, first,
we got to count it.

11:58.761 --> 11:59.980
Then we got to weigh it,
test the quality.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.460
I already booked my flight.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.421
Are you in some kind
of hurry, Ines?

12:09.641 --> 12:12.166
I'll let you know
when we're ready.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.260
Yo, what's going on with
that fool that got locked up?

12:19.260 --> 12:20.565
My guy at Rikers
said he's there

12:20.565 --> 12:22.089
through the weekend at least.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.699
Mm, the big shipment
isn't coming till

12:23.699 --> 12:25.788
the middle next week.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.051
OK.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.184
Let's move her.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.838
Wouldn't it be easier if
we just took care of her now?

12:31.838 --> 12:35.102
Listen, we dust her while her
husband's in jail, he'll talk.

12:35.102 --> 12:38.018
If she stays with us,
he'll keep his mouth shut.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.628
But I don't want to look
at her no more right now.

12:39.628 --> 12:40.934
She got blood on my new shoes.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.110
Get her out of here.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.553
OK, Jamie just got something
back from the drug unit

12:51.553 --> 12:52.510
down in Miami.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.077
What'd you find out?

12:54.077 --> 12:55.775
Bernanda Menendez.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.124
She did two years
for possession,

12:57.124 --> 13:00.083
supposedly got connected
with some major players

13:00.083 --> 13:01.693
out of Havana.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.913
She used to race cars
down in South Beach.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.001
She the shot caller?

13:05.001 --> 13:06.611
<i>I mean, she's savvy.</i>

13:06.611 --> 13:08.657
She got her degree while
she was still in prison.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.747
But even with her resume,
something's telling me

13:11.747 --> 13:13.444
she's not at
the top of the food chain.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.838
Oh, hold on.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.493
Sherie's ear pods,
brand new and very traceable

13:18.493 --> 13:19.973
through her husband's
cloud account.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.626
He sent the password
with written consent,

13:21.626 --> 13:23.890
and I got a warrant
signed by a judge.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.936
They're moving to the
Cross Bronx right now.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.111
Hey, where are you?

13:28.111 --> 13:29.460
About to hit Harlem.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.114
OK, turn around.

13:31.114 --> 13:34.117
We might have her moving
down the Cross Bronx.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.252
Sir, roll down the window.
Put out your hands.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.297
Nice and slow.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.299
Hands outside the window.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.784
How you doing today?

13:48.784 --> 13:51.352
Fine.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.876
Step outside the vehicle, please.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.971
- Where you headed?
- I ain't got to tell you that.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.886
OK, fair enough.
Put your hands on the hood.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.367
Search the vehicle.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.859
Anything?
- Nope.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.908
What is that?

14:25.908 --> 14:28.302
Credit card.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.391
What do you got?

14:30.391 --> 14:34.569
I ain't seen
one of these in a minute.

14:34.569 --> 14:37.746
But there's always
a combination.

14:54.937 --> 14:58.245
Sir,
it's my duty to inform you

14:58.245 --> 15:00.682
you're not free to go.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.995
Well, we found ear buds and
a relatively fresh bloodstain.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.866
And I'm no detective,
but I think they're both

15:10.866 --> 15:12.955
going to tie us back to Sherie.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.958
Well, we're looking at
two days for DNA to confirm.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.743
If she's alive and injured, we
don't have that kind of time.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.267
What about the driver?

15:20.267 --> 15:22.138
Well, he clammed up and
is asking for a lawyer.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.574
Hold on a second, Sarge.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.446
Worked in auto crime
for a bit before I got here.

15:25.446 --> 15:28.144
That trap is one of the most
sophisticated I've ever seen.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.841
A system that complex,

15:29.841 --> 15:32.932
there's only one guy
I know who could build them.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.195
Sarge, we may have a lead.
Let me call you back.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.893
It's impressive work.
Circuits are clean.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.808
Relief valve
is top of the line.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.202
There's a heat exchanger.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.551
You don't see those too often.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.900
Believe me.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.380
I'd love to take credit
for this,

15:46.380 --> 15:48.599
but I've been out of the
business almost two years now.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.210
But in your day,
though, right?

15:50.210 --> 15:53.996
Oh, brother, in my day, I was
the Michael Jordan of traps.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.085
So who's coming off the
bench to build like that?

15:56.085 --> 15:59.610
Maybe someone you worked with?

15:59.610 --> 16:00.655
It should be just
that easy, right?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.178
I should just give you a name?

16:02.178 --> 16:04.006
I'm no snitch.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.965
Hey, we're tracking a gang
of Cubans out of Miami

16:05.965 --> 16:08.271
who have kidnapped
a young woman.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.012
The only thing we know
about the trap in that car,

16:10.012 --> 16:11.840
it was designed
to hold a person,

16:11.840 --> 16:14.756
and there was blood in it.

16:14.756 --> 16:18.847
You want to be responsible
if we can't find her?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.459
<i>Let me go!</i>

16:22.459 --> 16:24.287
Let me go!
No!

16:28.422 --> 16:29.727
What happened?

16:29.727 --> 16:31.077
She was screaming
in the trap.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.515
Pulled her out.
Had to switch cars.

16:34.515 --> 16:38.040
I'm claustrophobic!

16:42.088 --> 16:44.612
Chaz got pulled over.

16:44.612 --> 16:45.656
What?

16:45.656 --> 16:48.007
He's in custody.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.751
- Does jefe know?
- No, no, no.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.666
And I want to keep it that way.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.059
We're going to keep it
quiet until the drop,

16:57.059 --> 16:59.888
and then we'll deal
with all this.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.543
Chaz was our driver.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.067
We can't do this without him.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.333
I'm going to
take care of her.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.467
And you find us another driver.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.042
So what's our play?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.826
You ever play flag football?

17:24.826 --> 17:27.350
Are you kidding me?
I crushed it in my day.

17:27.350 --> 17:30.440
Throw up your arm and
make sure they go deep.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.442
Here we go.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.791
Good coverage.
Good coverage.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.097
Keep your eye on the ball,
number two.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.794
Josh, you hug him.
That's right.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.100
Hug that ball.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.710
Hey, Nestor,
how are you doing?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.060
Oh, hey, no parents on the
field at pre-game, all right?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.758
Excuse me, uh, who are you?

17:43.758 --> 17:45.542
I got it, I got it!

17:45.542 --> 17:47.805
He's us.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.330
Got your name from
Georgio Sanz.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.810
Let's you and I have a chat.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.946
- Joey, cover for me here.
- Yeah.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.513
Look, I've got a
legit business now.

17:59.513 --> 18:00.949
It's a body shop.
- Mm-hmm.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.603
I busted my butt to open it
during the pandemic.

18:02.603 --> 18:05.258
I wouldn't do anything illegal.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.958
OK, so street racers
come to me from time to time,

18:09.958 --> 18:12.003
but I don't ask any questions.
- Ah.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.571
Building a trap is
illegal in New York State.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.920
Just because you
don't ask questions

18:15.920 --> 18:17.879
doesn't make you innocent.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.098
Come on, man.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.273
Don't do me like this,
all right?

18:20.273 --> 18:22.057
I only got my kid
two weekends a month.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.493
And I'm sure they
don't want to see you

18:23.493 --> 18:26.148
walked off the field in cuffs.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.198
What do you need?

18:34.243 --> 18:35.462
I got here as
quick as I could.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.028
What's up?

18:37.028 --> 18:39.074
You know, I never
looked at your entire file

18:39.074 --> 18:40.641
when you first joined the team.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.469
Even though I
told him he had to.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.687
Probably why I didn't.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.993
You ready to say sorry now?

18:44.993 --> 18:46.821
You have quite a backstory.

18:46.821 --> 18:47.909
That means he's impressed.

18:47.909 --> 18:51.478
No, I never said that.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.741
Is this you?

18:53.741 --> 18:55.656
That was me, yeah.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.093
You raced stock cars
in Jersey.

18:58.093 --> 19:01.488
A long time ago, way
before I joined the Academy.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.880
Oh.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.230
You any good?

19:04.230 --> 19:06.188
I was great.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.712
Didn't I tell you he was
going to say that? He's cocky.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.411
Well, it works for the part.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.934
What's going on here?

19:12.934 --> 19:14.631
Elliot made contact
with a guy named Nestor.

19:14.631 --> 19:17.765
He owns a shop where he
services street racers.

19:17.765 --> 19:21.377
He's going to walk us into the
street racing scene tonight.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.467
And we need an undercover
to play the part.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.991
Yeah, we know the
crew who took Sherie.

19:26.991 --> 19:29.733
They go to these races to
scout for their drivers.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.909
So if we can find out
who they are,

19:31.909 --> 19:34.216
maybe they'll
lead us to Sherie.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.045
You up for this?

19:37.045 --> 19:38.916
First undercover op?
Hell yeah.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.309
I feel ready.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.181
Sarge, I think we're
off to the races.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.226
No.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.881
All right, Jet and Reyes are
going to be backup for you.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.057
Jet is going to create
a whole online profile,

19:49.057 --> 19:51.102
social media handles,
family stuff.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.843
I need you to study up.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.018
Be on top of your game.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.237
We don't have a lot of time.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.282
You got it?

19:56.282 --> 19:57.761
100%.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.372
All right.

19:59.372 --> 20:02.070

20:30.359 --> 20:32.405
Well done.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.580
All right, you're going to need
to check in and pay

20:33.580 --> 20:35.277
the entry fee if you're
going to race.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.539
You could always scratch later.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.585
Just looks like you're serious.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.890
- Yo, Nestor.
- Hey!

20:39.890 --> 20:41.588
Hey.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.938
Let me
see what you're working with.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.292
All right, we're in.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.468
<i>This is bringing back memories.</i>

20:54.209 --> 20:56.690
So how many of those
therapy sessions have

20:56.690 --> 20:58.822
you had to do over the years?

20:58.822 --> 20:59.867
Let's just say
the next one,

20:59.867 --> 21:01.912
I get a free set
of steak knives.

21:01.912 --> 21:04.175
How'd it go?

21:04.175 --> 21:05.829
Fine.

21:05.829 --> 21:09.398
Oh, so you
clammed up as usual.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.531
- Did he call you?
- He didn't have to.

21:11.531 --> 21:12.662
I'm a woman.

21:12.662 --> 21:13.924
What the hell does that mean?

21:13.924 --> 21:15.143
Oh, come on, Elliot.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.624
We both know
you do not open up.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.104
It just irritates me
that you've been given

21:20.104 --> 21:24.108
an opportunity to talk,
and you won't take it.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.502
Unburden yourself.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.855
I'm done.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.422
Well, if you've
got so much to say,

21:33.422 --> 21:34.684
why don't you go talk him?
- We're not talking about me.

21:34.684 --> 21:37.121
We talking about you.
Go back.

21:44.215 --> 21:46.130
- Anything?
- Nothing.

21:46.130 --> 21:49.482
Hey, so you see the guy
over my left shoulder?

21:49.482 --> 21:51.527
The leather jacket?

21:51.527 --> 21:54.617
He picked up the trap
car from the garage.

21:54.617 --> 21:55.705
All right.

21:55.705 --> 21:58.229
You're going to introduce us.

21:58.229 --> 21:59.405
OK, we're going over there.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.668
Say I'm a friend
from out of town.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.365
You good?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.501
Hey, yo.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.198
What's up, Nestor?

22:10.198 --> 22:12.026
- Hey.
- Good to see you, man.

22:12.026 --> 22:14.681
Yeah, yo, this is
my boy from LA, Kevin.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.073
'Sup, man?

22:16.073 --> 22:18.598
From the Mecca?

22:18.598 --> 22:20.295
You do any racing up there?

22:20.295 --> 22:22.689
<i>Cerritos, Long Beach, Compton,</i>

22:22.689 --> 22:24.473
wherever the action is.

22:24.473 --> 22:25.866
Are we going to see
any of that

22:25.866 --> 22:28.216
West Coast flavor tonight?

22:28.216 --> 22:30.218
The field looks pretty weak.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.046
Yeah, it's not worth it
if one of these amateurs

22:32.046 --> 22:34.918
kicks off and sideswipes me.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.008
What's the payout tonight?

22:38.008 --> 22:40.359
6k.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.099
That's not enough for you?

22:42.099 --> 22:46.582
No, you race like me,
you got bills to pay, no.

22:46.582 --> 22:50.151
Nestor don't let anyone
touch his ride.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.548
So you must be decent?

22:58.115 --> 23:00.553
I'll lay 20k down to find out.

23:00.553 --> 23:04.513
All you got to do is win.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.297
<i>Oh, I can win.</i>

23:06.297 --> 23:10.563
You do, and there'll be more
where that came from.

23:13.566 --> 23:17.091
Go get your ride, Nestor.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.179
All you got to do is win.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.964
Hey, I told you I can win.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.971
Drivers.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.234
Are you ready?

23:30.234 --> 23:33.063
On the count of 3,

23:33.063 --> 23:35.501
1...
- Whoo!

23:35.501 --> 23:38.417
2, 3.

23:39.983 --> 23:42.769
Go!

23:54.258 --> 23:56.304
What do you want to do?

23:56.304 --> 23:59.655
The cops are here now.

24:07.576 --> 24:09.012
Hey, hey!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.584
You got him?

24:15.584 --> 24:18.065
- Don't move. Come on.
- Man, come on.

24:29.163 --> 24:32.296
How's the hand?

24:32.296 --> 24:33.341
It'll be all right.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.473
It's not the first time,
you know?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.126
Hitting a cop?

24:36.126 --> 24:37.824
Jumped a guy that was
supposed to pay me 20k.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.521
What else was I supposed to do?

24:41.871 --> 24:43.873
Yeah.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.791
You must be really broke.

24:48.791 --> 24:52.142
I just like money
and driving fast, man.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.492
I can respect that.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.667
Cristobal Ruiz,

24:54.667 --> 24:56.756
Guillermo Pasqual,
Santiago Elias.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.584
Let's go.
You made bail.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.324
Lucky, hombre.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.982
Do you have any idea
of the amount of strings

25:05.982 --> 25:08.507
I had to pull to get you out?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.812
That detective you hit?

25:09.812 --> 25:12.772
Reyes had to talk him
off the ledge.

25:12.772 --> 25:15.992
- I got us a number.
- What number?

25:15.992 --> 25:19.169
The guy who can get us
closer to finding Sherie.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.914
Go get cleaned up.

25:27.874 --> 25:31.486
We did get a number.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.270
I got something
you should hear.

25:33.270 --> 25:36.970
5-2 just sent this over
from their phone logs.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.841
<i>Baby, tell me you're OK.</i>

25:38.841 --> 25:40.321
I'm OK.

25:40.321 --> 25:42.018
<i>But they want me to
tell you something.</i>

25:42.018 --> 25:45.021
<i>Tell them I'll do whatever
if they just let you go.</i>

25:45.021 --> 25:47.546
<i>Tino, listen,
they said you're doing good,</i>

25:47.546 --> 25:49.373
<i>but you got to sit tight.</i>

25:49.373 --> 25:51.767
<i>A couple more days, then
they're going to let me go.</i>

25:51.767 --> 25:54.030
<i>Just keep doing
what you're doing.</i>

25:54.030 --> 25:55.945
<i>You understand?
- Sherie, I'm sorry.</i>

25:55.945 --> 25:57.643
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

25:57.643 --> 25:59.601
<i>And they're saying
I got to go.</i>

25:59.601 --> 26:00.950
<i>- Sherie, wait.
- I'm sorry.</i>

26:00.950 --> 26:02.822
<i>I love you.
- Wait!</i>

26:02.822 --> 26:04.650
OK, well, the good news
is Sherie's still alive.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.608
And they don't know
Tino's talked to us.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.915
But they need him quiet
for a few days more.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.569
That tells me they're
planning something.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.179
Bill.

26:12.179 --> 26:14.747
What are the odds they let
Sherie go once it's over?

26:14.747 --> 26:17.619
Well, that's not a bet
I'm willing to make.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.621
Sergeant.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.754
OK.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.669
Let me call the number
Cristobal gave me.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.584
It's our best option.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.848
CSU found prints
in the trap car.

26:28.848 --> 26:31.590
They're Cristobal's.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.592
Make the call.

26:40.381 --> 26:41.904
So how do you feel?

26:41.904 --> 26:45.429
Like we are running
out of time and options.

26:45.429 --> 26:48.128
I got some doubts, too.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.520
Why?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.131
He's just like you.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.829
Leaps before
he looks sometimes.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.440
I've learned to trust it
in you, so...

26:56.440 --> 26:58.965
Plus, we'll have his
back the entire time.

26:58.965 --> 27:01.750
Yeah.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.622
Anything else
you want to tell me?

27:06.755 --> 27:08.627
Yeah, thanks.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.151
For what?

27:11.151 --> 27:13.719
I made another appointment
with that shrink.

27:13.719 --> 27:14.807
Well, look at you.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.635
You're welcome.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.288
There is hope for you yet.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.551
I say that to myself
every morning in the mirror.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.337
I'm in.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.773
Going to meet Cristobal
this afternoon.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.427
OK, great.

27:26.427 --> 27:30.213
Stick around because I want to
go over next steps with you.

27:47.796 --> 27:50.364
You made it.

27:50.364 --> 27:52.714
Give me your wallet.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.324
What is this, a robbery now?

27:54.324 --> 27:55.674
Nah.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.938
I just ain't never seen
a California license.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.635
You're from California, right?

28:00.635 --> 28:02.681
Yeah.

28:02.681 --> 28:07.163
Come on, Fast and Furious.
Let me see your license.

28:14.170 --> 28:16.042
When did you take this picture, yesterday?

28:16.042 --> 28:17.783
Last month, I had it
suspended for a year.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.873
I just got it back.

28:21.961 --> 28:25.225
Walk with me.

28:25.225 --> 28:26.487
You have family?

28:26.487 --> 28:28.054
Brothers?
Sister?

28:28.054 --> 28:29.098
Parents?

28:29.098 --> 28:30.230
Sister.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.188
Parents are dead.

28:32.188 --> 28:35.278
You know, you can just look
this up on Facebook, dude.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.541
I did.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.893
I was making sure it syncs up.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.592
I want you to call your sister.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.725
Lydia, right?

28:48.857 --> 28:53.819
Or don't,
and be on your merry way.

28:53.819 --> 28:57.692
All right, all right.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.433
We'll text her first.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.739
When was the last time
you answered a number

29:00.739 --> 29:03.437
you didn't recognize?

29:05.613 --> 29:08.877
You know, I've been
thinking about something.

29:08.877 --> 29:11.793
How did you get out of jail

29:11.793 --> 29:15.666
if you had no money
and you hit a cop?

29:15.666 --> 29:18.757
Hm?

29:21.629 --> 29:23.457
Ask her.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.592
This Lydia?

29:28.592 --> 29:30.899
<i>Kevin?</i>

29:30.899 --> 29:32.683
<i>Whose phone is this?</i>

29:32.683 --> 29:35.251
<i>What kind of trouble have
you gotten yourself into now?</i>

29:35.251 --> 29:39.429
And I am not sending you
any more money.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.822
<i>Kevin?</i>

29:40.822 --> 29:44.347
Tell her
you'll call her back.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.001
Lyd.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.786
No, no, no, no,
that's a false alarm.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.484
I know.
All right, bye.

29:53.052 --> 29:55.358
Anything else?

29:55.358 --> 29:57.447
All right, how much money
are we talking about?

29:57.447 --> 29:59.014
Because I've had
enough of this, man.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.103
First one is free.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.584
Just to make sure you're in.
- Free? Free?

30:03.584 --> 30:04.933
No, I need to get paid.

30:04.933 --> 30:08.284
First one's free.

30:08.284 --> 30:12.811
Or we hold your sister
as collateral.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.948
We've done it before.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.866
Meet me at Melrose at 5:30.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.086
Don't be late.

30:29.566 --> 30:30.959
I'll be honest.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.701
I wasn't expecting your call.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.442
Yeah, me neither.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.357
I'm glad you did.

30:37.357 --> 30:42.275
So anything in particular
you want to talk about?

30:42.275 --> 30:43.798
Well, in answer
to your question,

30:43.798 --> 30:45.974
I don't like endings.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.497
- My question?
- From last week,

30:47.497 --> 30:51.501
when you asked me why
I wanted to go back to work.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.939
I don't like endings.

30:53.939 --> 30:57.116
Can you tell me more?

30:59.727 --> 31:01.947
Mm, yeah.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.992
Um,

31:03.992 --> 31:07.996
you know,
when I lost my wife, um...

31:10.912 --> 31:16.875
You know, that was the very
clear definition of--of...

31:18.050 --> 31:20.574
Of an ending.

31:20.574 --> 31:26.536
So this is about
the death of a loved one?

31:26.536 --> 31:29.670
Loss.

31:29.670 --> 31:34.066
It's a little more general.

31:34.066 --> 31:37.417
For example,
my kids, they're grown.

31:37.417 --> 31:41.116
You know, they've moved on.
They have lives of their own.

31:41.116 --> 31:46.295
And... I just feel loss.

31:49.951 --> 31:53.607
I, uh...

31:53.607 --> 31:56.610
it's like the ending
of my family.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.221
Um...

31:59.221 --> 32:01.223
I've just had that--

32:01.223 --> 32:07.142
that lens about everything
since my wife.

32:07.142 --> 32:11.146
I recently lost a friend,

32:11.146 --> 32:16.064
a very close friend, partner.

32:16.064 --> 32:19.198
Care to tell me
how that happened?

32:19.198 --> 32:23.463
Through neglect on my part.

32:26.031 --> 32:29.599
Fear,

32:29.599 --> 32:32.776
selfishness.

32:37.694 --> 32:41.350
Sounds like you're a man
in need of a new beginning.

32:50.707 --> 32:53.232
Excuse me.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.190
Uh, Doc, I'm sorry.
I got to go.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.279
Shall we make
another appointment?

32:57.279 --> 32:58.585
- Yeah, yeah.
- Before you leave?

32:58.585 --> 33:01.370
Yeah, I'll--I'll get
back to you on that.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.806
Thank you.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.779
Oh, what are the odds?

33:18.779 --> 33:20.781
Not you.

33:20.781 --> 33:21.956
Sorry about the other night.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.262
Sorry about the eye.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.828
You could have
given us a heads up.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.613
Yeah, we just--we didn't
have time to coordinate,

33:26.613 --> 33:30.486
but we appreciate
your help now.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.402
So I prepped
this car for you?

33:33.402 --> 33:35.143
Yeah.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.015
All right.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.712
Well, before I hand
over the keys,

33:38.712 --> 33:40.540
there's just one thing
we need to cover.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.503
Now we're good.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.942
- You good?
- Yeah, good.

33:51.942 --> 33:55.511
All right.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.964
All right,
mic check, one, two.

34:13.964 --> 34:16.837
<i>I hope you guys can hear me
because here I go.</i>

34:18.708 --> 34:20.536
He'll be fine.

34:22.625 --> 34:26.107
Yo!

34:26.107 --> 34:27.761
Hey, what's good?

34:31.547 --> 34:33.027
Yo.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.986
Hold it.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.771
Hey.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.557
Hey.

34:41.557 --> 34:44.560
I already went through this
with your boss man.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.824
You still don't trust me,
I'm out.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.739
<i>Go ask him.</i>

34:49.739 --> 34:53.830
Go ask him.

34:53.830 --> 34:57.095
Wait here.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.862
She's here.
Sherie's here.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.125
<i>I had eyes on her.</i>

35:27.125 --> 35:28.865
Back room, straight ahead.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.302
<i>But she seems OK.</i>

35:34.349 --> 35:37.135
Listen, I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm ditching the wire.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.321
Yo, what you doing in there?

35:50.974 --> 35:54.021
What do you think I'm doing?

35:54.021 --> 35:55.544
I told you to stay out here.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.332
<i>Open the door.</i>

36:01.985 --> 36:03.900
Open the door!

36:09.471 --> 36:10.864
I guess you're one of
those guys who doesn't

36:10.864 --> 36:12.996
wash his hands after he--

36:15.869 --> 36:18.437
Is that good for you, too?

36:18.437 --> 36:20.743
Let's go.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.486
Do we go in?

36:24.486 --> 36:26.749
Yeah, but we're not
going in guns blazing.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.362
There he is.
What's up, man?

36:30.362 --> 36:31.711
Kevin.

36:34.235 --> 36:37.760
Hey.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.851
You're a long way from Cali,
aren't you, pretty boy?

36:41.851 --> 36:43.766
You grow up there?

36:43.766 --> 36:45.768
Mostly.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.469
That's funny.

36:50.469 --> 36:55.865
I've never met no one from LA
without tan lines.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.563
I could show you tan lines,

36:57.563 --> 37:01.567
but I should buy you dinner
first, right?

37:01.567 --> 37:03.569
I like him.

37:03.569 --> 37:06.702
Told you.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.705
Cristobal tell you we're down
a couple of drivers right now?

37:09.705 --> 37:11.533
He did.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.143
And you want to help out?

37:13.143 --> 37:14.754
If the money's right.

37:14.754 --> 37:18.192
Well, no,
that's for the boss to decide.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.889
I thought he was the boss.

37:19.889 --> 37:23.066
No, no.

37:23.066 --> 37:28.289
The boss man is a real OG.

37:28.289 --> 37:32.293
And lucky for you, we're going
to go meet him right now.

37:35.427 --> 37:39.169
Come on, Kevin.
Trying to be a funny man, huh?

37:46.525 --> 37:48.527
They're heading out.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.459
Follow that car.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.374
Let's get Sherie.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.186
Police. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.841
Don't move.
Show me your hands.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.451
Get up.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.499
Police.
Drop your weapon.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.892
Hand behind your back.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.640
On your knees.
On your knees.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.295
All right, I got these two.
You go.

39:06.561 --> 39:07.693
Who's there?

39:07.693 --> 39:09.695
Sherie, it's me.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.914
Police, police.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.481
We're police.
- Tino, where is Tino?

39:13.481 --> 39:14.917
My husband, where's Tino?

39:14.917 --> 39:16.223
We have him. We have him.

39:16.223 --> 39:17.267
He's safe.
He's safe.

39:17.267 --> 39:21.010
Shh.

39:23.665 --> 39:26.059
Who the hell is that?

39:26.059 --> 39:27.408
Is there a car behind us?

39:27.408 --> 39:28.888
Yeah, it feels like
cops to me.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.237
Why would there be cops?

39:30.237 --> 39:31.194
How long have they
been following us?

39:31.194 --> 39:33.936
Since we left.

39:37.897 --> 39:40.639
Lose them.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.249
You want to work for us,

39:42.249 --> 39:43.990
you need to prove
you can follow orders.

39:43.990 --> 39:46.732
Just pull over.
See if they stop.

39:46.732 --> 39:49.604
We can deal with this
the real, real way.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.748
- What is he doing?
- He knows we're following.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.967
Keep up.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.280
All right,
they're chasing us.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.151
Get us out of here.
- I'ma blast these fools.

40:15.151 --> 40:16.631
No, hold on.

40:31.298 --> 40:34.519
All right.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.259
All right, Cali.

40:36.259 --> 40:38.218
We're going to
have fun with you.

40:38.218 --> 40:39.915
Just tell me where to go.
