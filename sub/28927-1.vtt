00:28.641 --> 00:32.845
Eight, nine, ten...

00:43.689 --> 00:46.691
Colossal 31,
it was an NVG mission,

00:46.693 --> 00:49.627
night vision goggles,
which means we're flying at night time

00:49.629 --> 00:52.798
using nothing but the, uh,
binoculars that we had.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.835
- <i>4143, you're in the group.</i>
- <i>South.</i>

01:00.473 --> 01:02.340
We had a Chinook unit
that was attached to us

01:02.342 --> 01:04.342
called the Washington
Air National Guard,

01:04.343 --> 01:06.644
who had been going
in and out of the same LZ

01:06.646 --> 01:08.814
during the day time,
weeks prior.

01:08.816 --> 01:11.282
So when they heard that we were
gonna be coming out of Bagram

01:11.284 --> 01:13.584
doing it under NVGs, they kinda
called us up and said,

01:13.586 --> 01:16.420
"Don't do it, because it's
really high on the ridgeline,

01:16.422 --> 01:18.957
very high winds,
and a very steep valley".

01:18.959 --> 01:21.959
But the Ground Force Commander
wanted to be exfilled under NVGs.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.835
So with that being said,
we put our most experienced pilot

01:30.837 --> 01:33.772
in command on board, we put
our most experienced PI,

01:33.774 --> 01:36.676
and we put four crew members
in the back, not just three.

01:39.712 --> 01:42.246
<i>You got a bad filter?
Hold your fort.</i>

01:42.248 --> 01:45.650
- <i>Hold her down.</i>
- <i>Roger that.</i>

01:45.652 --> 01:47.888
<i>Dropping back down
to about 500 AGO.</i>

01:48.922 --> 01:53.259
- <i>Maintain it at 81.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:57.296 --> 02:01.935
<i>Copy that, 06. Looks like
we're about two clicks from the LZ.</i>

02:10.276 --> 02:12.446
<i>We've only got 364 days to go.</i>

02:16.549 --> 02:21.420
The winds were pretty high,
the landing zone was essentially

02:21.422 --> 02:27.258
a rock ledge that was
probably 20 meters wide.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.761
<i>Colossal 31,
be careful on the approach,</i>

02:29.763 --> 02:32.597
<i>I see a lot of trees
on that ridge line.</i>

02:32.599 --> 02:38.570
What the pilots were trying to do
was back in with the ramp down,

02:38.572 --> 02:43.374
put the lip of the ramp on the
rock, uh, ledge, have the LRAS team,

02:43.376 --> 02:47.379
I believe was seven people,
uh, come onto

02:47.381 --> 02:52.051
the Chinook and then,
uh, fly away.

02:52.053 --> 02:54.686
They had to do
a tailgate landing.

02:54.688 --> 02:58.522
It's something we'd practiced,
it's in our ATM, this is what we do.

02:58.524 --> 02:59.961
<i>Alright,
I'm bringing her down.</i>

03:05.766 --> 03:07.735
<i>Keep it steady,
keep it steady.</i>

03:09.436 --> 03:10.836
So, we were tearing there.

03:10.838 --> 03:13.774
They kinda started drifting aft.

03:21.315 --> 03:24.485
<i>It's coming awful close
to that tree line, Colossal 31.</i>

03:33.928 --> 03:35.395
<i>We're right
on the ridge.</i>

03:43.871 --> 03:46.338
<i>A massive, 31.
Come in, come in.</i>

04:05.527 --> 04:08.527
Back at Bagram,
probably about eleven o'clock at night,

04:08.529 --> 04:12.732
our SP knocked on the doors
and said that, uh,

04:12.734 --> 04:15.469
Eric Totten's aircraft
went down.

04:16.603 --> 04:19.070
The aft rotor system hit a tree,

04:19.072 --> 04:21.140
causing the forward
and the aft rotor system

04:21.142 --> 04:24.879
to collide and completely tore
apart the entire helicopter.

04:25.879 --> 04:28.648
Nobody survived,
we lost all ten.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.852
There was nothing but burning
embers at the bottom of the valley.

04:32.887 --> 04:35.757
We were in disbelief that like,
"This cannot be happening right now."

04:41.728 --> 04:42.830
We were all listening.

04:43.865 --> 04:46.067
We were listening
for our friends to come home.

04:51.605 --> 04:52.905
And they never came home.

05:14.595 --> 05:17.964
What happened with the Apache?
They left our friends.

05:24.572 --> 05:27.073
So, this is all the stuff
I have from Afghanistan

05:27.075 --> 05:30.509
and, and my time
of active duty in the army.

05:30.511 --> 05:32.880
This is the actual patch
that we had on our flight suits,

05:32.882 --> 05:35.182
it says, "Ugly but well hung".

05:35.184 --> 05:37.683
This is 10th Mountain's,
a patch they gave to us.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.988
The Apache, the Hawk and the,
and the Chinook right there.

05:53.101 --> 05:55.001
So, they came in that night,

05:55.003 --> 05:56.770
we're standing in between
our B Huts outside,

05:56.772 --> 05:58.604
it was already getting dark

05:58.606 --> 06:00.909
and the captain starts
telling us about what happened.

06:02.677 --> 06:04.945
He starts telling us that,

06:04.947 --> 06:08.681
"I guess you heard,
the Chinook crashed last night.

06:08.683 --> 06:12.185
And those guys pretty much killed
themselves and everybody on board",

06:12.187 --> 06:15.590
and he came across blaming them.

06:17.059 --> 06:22.164
Sat there for... what seemed like
forever, I think, "What, what the hell?

06:23.498 --> 06:25.498
That's... that's horrible."

06:25.500 --> 06:26.901
And he said, "No,
that's not the worst of it."

06:28.237 --> 06:30.904
You know, you... "What do you
mean that's not the worst of it?"

06:30.906 --> 06:35.642
So, he goes, "10th Mountain's blaming
us, the Apaches, for leaving them.

06:35.644 --> 06:39.980
Your buddies left them."
At that point he said like,

06:39.982 --> 06:42.615
"If y'all hear anything
from 10th Mountain

06:42.617 --> 06:45.252
bad about us, just ignore them.

06:45.254 --> 06:46.954
They don't know
what they're talking about."

06:46.956 --> 06:48.123
And at that point,

06:49.258 --> 06:52.659
my blood pressure was
through the roof.

06:52.661 --> 06:54.094
I pointed at the captain
and told him,

06:54.096 --> 06:55.597
"Who the fuck are you

06:56.298 --> 06:58.932
to bad-mouth
American troops like that?

06:58.934 --> 07:01.101
Who the hell are you to leave
American troops on that mountain.

07:01.103 --> 07:05.808
Don't you ever do that.
How dare you leave our guys like that?"

07:08.244 --> 07:12.079
I read that every now and then
to remind me also that

07:12.081 --> 07:14.515
you gotta watch out
for everybody else in life.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.653
"He called upon us all the sum of
his knowledge and made a judgement.

07:19.655 --> 07:24.058
He believed in it so strongly that
he knowingly bet his life on it.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.962
That he was mistaken in his judgement
is a tragedy, not stupidity.

07:28.697 --> 07:31.164
Every supervisor
and contemporary who ever spoke

07:31.166 --> 07:33.802
to him, had an opportunity
to influence his judgement,

07:34.903 --> 07:37.738
so a little bit of all of us goes
in with every troop we lose."

07:46.015 --> 07:47.717
Now, gotta read that,
every now and then.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.967
<i>I haven't been up here since
these guys started shooting and stuff.</i>

08:05.969 --> 08:07.770
- <i>Oh really?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

08:09.506 --> 08:11.173
<i>Won't be surprised if we find
some RPGs in that woodpile down there.</i>

08:19.649 --> 08:22.350
<i>Stay to the right here, till we
can get over this thing, if not we can make</i>

08:22.352 --> 08:25.353
<i>a left turn. Don't descend
unless you have to, alright?</i>

08:25.355 --> 08:30.226
- <i>Roger.</i>
- <i>Keep the altitude that we got.</i>

08:33.296 --> 08:37.067
What we were being told
to expect coming into Afghanistan

08:38.134 --> 08:41.071
was that the insurgency
was ba... basically broken.

09:03.893 --> 09:04.828
<i>Roger and over.</i>

09:06.362 --> 09:11.032
So we'd turn on the lights,
we found a lot of Taliban and Al-Qaeda,

09:11.034 --> 09:15.305
and all of a sudden,
we were in contact just about everywhere.

09:27.183 --> 09:28.118
<i>Shit.</i>

09:29.486 --> 09:34.358
<i>I'm taking
fire. Just</i>...

09:35.258 --> 09:40.129
<i>Yeah, pick up your speed as fast as
you can. It's really not good up here.</i>

09:46.736 --> 09:49.340
<i>Nobody up here.</i>

09:50.940 --> 09:55.444
<i>We just received fire</i>

09:55.446 --> 09:59.147
<i>about two clicks east
of the Lumberyard...</i>

10:06.423 --> 10:09.792
<i>That looked to be a direct
hit, good shooting, Deadwood.</i>

10:24.508 --> 10:26.910
We were not making friends
when we first started, so...

10:27.811 --> 10:31.013
God help us.
We've got ten months left,

10:31.015 --> 10:32.449
and it will be brutal.

10:34.117 --> 10:36.720
We had to be perfect.

10:44.228 --> 10:47.963
On this day, it was a day mission,
we were just to follow several Chinooks

10:47.965 --> 10:51.100
as they made it to the different FOBs
dropping off different things and people.

10:55.838 --> 10:59.975
<i>Yeah, Deadwood 6-3,
uh, coming in from the West.</i>

10:59.977 --> 11:03.278
<i>We'd like to uh, open up their
range, give it a sweep here.</i>

11:03.280 --> 11:06.783
<i>Roger that.</i>

11:11.422 --> 11:13.424
We're flying across
the Gardez Desert.

11:15.460 --> 11:20.262
I was looking around and just at
that point...

11:20.264 --> 11:26.001
...I was thinking, "Jesus, what is
wrong?" It was like a solid rush of heat.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.542
Something's going wrong here,

11:32.544 --> 11:35.277
something... I wanna get out
of the helicopter.

11:35.279 --> 11:38.180
<i>The Apache helicopter went down</i>

11:38.182 --> 11:41.317
<i>while trying to land at the
Montgomery County Airport.</i>

11:41.319 --> 11:46.488
Jeez, we're roasting across
the desert floor at 120 knots.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.995
If I just get out of here,
all I gotta do,

11:52.997 --> 11:55.030
all I gotta do is just...

11:55.032 --> 11:57.966
- Maybe just open the door and jump out...
- jump out.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.068
<i>Daniel Flores'
chopper went down.</i>

12:00.070 --> 12:02.404
I got a hotspot under my helmet,
I gotta change my helmet here.

12:02.406 --> 12:04.140
I gotta move my helmet around.

12:04.142 --> 12:06.008
Jesus, I gotta get out of here.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.811
How did I even drive home?

12:09.146 --> 12:11.079
My wife will wake me up
any minute now.

12:14.286 --> 12:17.452
And I'm like Jesus.

12:17.454 --> 12:19.389
Just take a deep breath.
Just take a deep breath.

12:19.391 --> 12:21.457
I gotta get out of here. This is...

12:21.459 --> 12:24.161
Just take
a deep breath.

12:29.367 --> 12:35.338
That was my first bout of what
would later become claustrophobia,

12:35.340 --> 12:38.974
anxiety and anxiety attacks
that go with it.

12:38.976 --> 12:41.211
That was the first time I'd ever
experienced something like that.

12:42.379 --> 12:44.647
<i>Somewhere in the
crumpled metal of the Apache helicopter</i>

12:44.649 --> 12:48.253
<i>lies a clue as to what made it
fall from the sky.</i>

12:49.287 --> 12:51.555
We set up to do
traffic patterns.

12:51.557 --> 12:53.458
I was doing the flying
from the front seat.

12:54.993 --> 12:57.959
Just as I was
about to reduce power to land

12:57.961 --> 13:00.196
to the approach end
of runway 1-4,

13:00.198 --> 13:02.398
a Learjet calls up
on the radio saying,

13:02.400 --> 13:06.336
"Montgomery County traffic,
this is Learjet 6-5 Charlie.

13:06.338 --> 13:10.573
We are four mile final
for runway 1-4."

13:10.575 --> 13:14.210
I was thinking, "Yeah, this guy is gonna
be bearing down on us pretty fast".

13:14.212 --> 13:17.547
So as I'm starting to slow down,
even more to land,

13:17.549 --> 13:21.250
Tommy's thinking the same thing.
He took the flight controls,

13:21.252 --> 13:23.253
and we went forward
a little bit.

13:23.255 --> 13:25.357
That's the last thing I remember.

13:30.195 --> 13:32.463
<i>Less than five
minutes after take-off,</i>

13:32.465 --> 13:36.032
<i>the chopper fell to the ground,
it's landing gear mired in the mud.</i>

13:36.034 --> 13:40.637
<i>Chief warrant officers, Daniel Flores and
Thomas Einhorn were shaken up in the crash.</i>

13:40.639 --> 13:43.439
<i>Both were taken to Medical
Center Hospital in Conroe,</i>

13:43.441 --> 13:45.610
<i>put under observation,
then released.</i>

13:46.511 --> 13:50.583
How did I survive?
Literally by the grace of God.

13:53.251 --> 13:57.188
That was in August when
I had that first bout of anxiety.

13:58.424 --> 14:00.225
I went and saw
the flight surgeon.

14:01.259 --> 14:03.560
He... I told him
what was going on.

14:03.562 --> 14:06.597
He worked with me a little bit, not much.
He just said, "You, uh,

14:06.599 --> 14:10.032
you gotta learn to live with it, or you
want me to take you off flight status?"

14:10.034 --> 14:12.104
And there was no way
I could do that. So...

14:13.172 --> 14:15.240
I did what we all do
in the military.

14:16.374 --> 14:18.107
I fought through it.

14:29.155 --> 14:33.524
On that day, early October 2006,
we had already set the aircraft up,

14:33.526 --> 14:38.228
as we call them, we cocked them up
for the QRF, quick reaction force.

14:38.230 --> 14:41.132
We'd just sit around and wait for the
radios to come alive, to go help somebody.

14:43.202 --> 14:47.404
We were in the chow hall and
our Icom radios came to life.

14:47.406 --> 14:51.308
The Apache crew Deadwood
launch the QRF right now.

14:51.310 --> 14:52.645
We all looked at the radio,
going like,

14:53.679 --> 14:56.515
"Are they serious?
This has never happened before."

14:59.285 --> 15:02.753
We ran across the flight line.
The other Apache on the QRF,

15:02.755 --> 15:07.157
they were already sitting at 100
percent RPMs, waiting for me.

15:07.159 --> 15:09.159
<i>Clear right,
clear left. Clear.</i>

15:09.161 --> 15:11.662
We were stationed
at Bagram at the time.

15:11.664 --> 15:15.265
Most of our QRF missions were
just escorting Medivacs.

15:15.267 --> 15:17.769
So, it was a little odd
that we were actually dispatched

15:17.771 --> 15:22.038
to a firefight in the Tagab
valley, because as far as we know,

15:22.040 --> 15:24.977
at the time,
the Tagab was quiet.

15:51.805 --> 15:54.404
October 14th was
our first mission

15:54.406 --> 15:57.475
to roll down
through the Valley of Tagab,

15:57.477 --> 16:02.214
and meet with the senior members of
the village, and conduct a jirga.

16:05.217 --> 16:09.253
And we were also taking along a
donation of, um, school supplies,

16:09.255 --> 16:12.292
that we were gonna pass along
to the children of the village.

16:18.163 --> 16:21.133
I had turned 50 in 2006.

16:24.503 --> 16:27.539
And I arrived in Afghanistan.
I was not assigned to a unit.

16:29.209 --> 16:32.644
I was a forces
command fill,

16:32.646 --> 16:36.714
because they needed embedded
tactical trainers, ETTs.

16:38.985 --> 16:42.486
The job as an ETT,
as an embedded tactical trainer is...

16:42.488 --> 16:45.156
you're supposed to embed
with the Afghan army,

16:45.158 --> 16:48.258
and you... you liaise
between the US military

16:48.260 --> 16:49.461
and the Afghan military.

16:51.131 --> 16:54.899
We were two-man teams,
one officer and one senior enlisted.

16:54.901 --> 16:58.736
"Hall and Best, you go over there
and you guys report to your unit",

16:58.738 --> 17:01.839
and we reported, and they said, "Okay,
you guys are just gonna be paired up."

17:01.841 --> 17:03.174
It's total happenstance.

17:05.478 --> 17:08.881
You would have these
teams embedded and 100

17:08.883 --> 17:12.148
to 200 Afghan national
army personnel, you know.

17:13.619 --> 17:17.488
Because only once
you've got them sufficient

17:17.490 --> 17:21.528
to where they could secure and
govern themselves, could we leave.

17:24.497 --> 17:28.766
When we left Nijrab, my vehicle
was commanded by Lieutenant Hall,

17:28.768 --> 17:31.570
he was sitting
in the team chiefs' seat,

17:31.572 --> 17:34.608
and then I was the gunner
in the, uh, turret.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.910
And we had Naser
as our interpreter in the back,

17:38.912 --> 17:41.379
with radios to allow us
to communicate

17:41.381 --> 17:43.850
with the Afghan forces
that we were working with.

17:45.318 --> 17:48.453
I was a civilian
contractor. When I was working

17:48.455 --> 17:51.189
with the coalition forces
and NATO,

17:51.191 --> 17:53.358
my position was an interpreter,

17:53.360 --> 17:55.461
and I was doing
language services.

17:55.463 --> 17:57.930
Naser was, was one of those kids

17:57.932 --> 18:01.566
who loves his country so much,
he loves Afghanistan so much...

18:01.568 --> 18:04.870
...that he did whatever he could to help out.

18:04.872 --> 18:07.205
It wasn't
about the paycheck with him.

18:07.207 --> 18:09.874
It was all about helping
his country.

18:20.721 --> 18:23.254
In Afghanistan,
in the villages as soon as

18:23.256 --> 18:25.523
the light's up and after prayer,
they open up shop

18:25.525 --> 18:27.559
and they close
when they wanna close.

18:27.561 --> 18:30.863
Uh, so, when we were going down through,

18:30.865 --> 18:31.864
no shops were open.

18:35.302 --> 18:38.470
As we moved through
the little village of Afghania,

18:38.472 --> 18:43.442
we noticed that the kids weren't out
there waving, giving us thumbs up.

18:43.444 --> 18:46.612
We started seeing women and
children running from the fields.

18:48.816 --> 18:50.615
We continued on up the road

18:50.617 --> 18:53.419
and there was an Afghan
National Police post

18:53.421 --> 18:56.755
that you could always see Afghan
National Police walking on top of.

18:58.725 --> 19:01.495
The building was
completely abandoned.

19:02.797 --> 19:06.266
So that kind of put your Spidey
senses on tingle a little bit.

19:08.402 --> 19:11.036
As we roll
past that post,

19:11.038 --> 19:14.539
the Afghan commander
stopped the vehicle

19:14.541 --> 19:17.276
and was calling Naser,

19:17.278 --> 19:19.580
our interpreter on the radio,
and telling us to stop.

19:20.981 --> 19:25.753
Uh, so, I asked them what's going on.
He said, "Enemy, enemy".

19:27.288 --> 19:28.355
Stop right here.

19:31.525 --> 19:34.626
The Afghan commander
comes out, he walked out,

19:34.628 --> 19:37.295
he snatched the Dragon
off Sniper Rifle.

19:37.297 --> 19:39.600
He stuck it into
a hole in a compound.

20:03.892 --> 20:06.860
And he gets back out and smiles
and looks at me and goes,

20:06.862 --> 20:08.029
"Two. I got two."

20:09.764 --> 20:10.798
That's when I learned...

20:12.868 --> 20:14.801
what it sounds like
to get shot at.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.744
I began returning fire,

20:25.746 --> 20:29.015
and Lieutenant Hall called back
to the rear American vehicle

20:29.017 --> 20:32.486
to alert them that we were...
we had troops in contact.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.858
Big, long combo right, nine,
ten vehicles, something like that.

20:38.860 --> 20:42.761
The front three or four are the
ones getting engaged right now.

20:46.101 --> 20:50.937
I'm lieutenant, I have a
captain, uh, in the Humvee to my rear.

20:50.939 --> 20:53.540
Their radio's not working
or something, so he gets out

20:53.542 --> 20:56.810
and starts running up to us,
bounding and hopping.

20:56.812 --> 21:00.046
And, uh, he comes up to say,
"Hey, what's going on?"

21:00.048 --> 21:01.817
And that's when I kinda
give him the situation.

21:02.884 --> 21:04.753
Hey, get some guns
up high.

21:05.954 --> 21:09.022
When I turned my face,
I saw, uh,

21:09.024 --> 21:11.059
the rounds were hitting
in the Humvees.

21:14.864 --> 21:16.798
Four, shot to four o'clock.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.733
The whole time I'm trying
to call for air support.

21:23.405 --> 21:27.640
<i>Deadwood 6-7, Deadwood 6-7,
this is Vandal 1-6, over.</i>

21:27.642 --> 21:29.943
I know if I can get
some Apaches,

21:29.945 --> 21:32.445
they come with rockets, big guns

21:32.447 --> 21:34.649
and they can s... They come
with elevated positions.

21:44.893 --> 21:50.563
<i>Zero-five, 0-5,
6-7 to the blind and 8-4.</i>

22:00.176 --> 22:04.444
You don't wanna send one
aircraft out on its own ever.

22:04.446 --> 22:07.447
That was policy at the time,
in case one goes down,

22:07.449 --> 22:10.151
you wanna have somebody else there to
be able to provide support for 'em.

22:11.787 --> 22:16.723
<i>Stay up high
down in there.</i>

22:16.725 --> 22:20.027
When they dispatch us
to these situations,

22:20.029 --> 22:21.862
all we get is a brief,

22:21.864 --> 22:24.064
"Troops in contact
at this grid location.

22:24.066 --> 22:27.637
Here's a radio frequency,
go make contact with them and help them."

22:30.672 --> 22:34.674
<i>Vandal 0-5, Vandal 0-5,
this is Deadwood 6-7</i>

22:34.676 --> 22:38.511
<i>to the blind and Deadwood
8-4 inbound here rotations.</i>

22:38.513 --> 22:40.580
Their front seaters got put
in their coordinates to the entrance,

22:40.582 --> 22:42.484
to the Northern entrance
of the Tagab Valley.

22:44.153 --> 22:47.254
Where what we call, we're buster, we're
going as fast as we can. Military power.

22:47.256 --> 22:50.657
We didn't have any intelligence,
you know, on, you know,

22:50.659 --> 22:52.126
who these guys were
or what their...

22:52.128 --> 22:53.928
what their mission
actually was at the time.

22:53.930 --> 22:57.597
We knew we were supposed
to go talk to a Vandal 1-6,

22:57.599 --> 23:02.571
which was Lieutenant Hall and escort
him back, uh, back to their base.

23:04.106 --> 23:08.444
<i>Any Vandal elements, any Vandal elements.
This is Deadwood 6-3.</i>

23:10.646 --> 23:12.114
<i>All these people on the trail
to the right.</i>

23:14.750 --> 23:17.584
From the time we launched,
to the time we got to the north end

23:17.586 --> 23:20.888
of the Tagab, was all
of 15 minutes at the most.

23:20.890 --> 23:23.724
Those guys had already been
in a protracted fight

23:23.726 --> 23:27.695
for easily two hours
before we got called out.

23:27.697 --> 23:30.297
They were getting surrounded
by the Taliban.

23:30.299 --> 23:33.834
<i>Deadwood 6-7, is
that 1-6, we are in convoy,</i>

23:33.836 --> 23:35.604
<i>uh, to evac out of here.</i>

23:37.440 --> 23:40.943
<i>OK, coming in high? Big guy roger,
are you still in contact at this time?</i>

23:43.980 --> 23:48.549
From the standpoint
of a helicopter pilot,

23:48.551 --> 23:50.718
one of these things
is just like all the others.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.921
It's a lot more
of a significant experience

23:53.923 --> 23:56.824
for the guys who are actually
on the ground swapping bullets

23:56.826 --> 23:58.494
with the bad guys,
back and forth.

24:00.763 --> 24:06.267
5-3-3-7, this is 5-3-0,
coming hard now, coming hard.

24:11.141 --> 24:12.175
And where's it at?

24:14.111 --> 24:15.911
Man,
where the fuck are they?

24:20.117 --> 24:22.285
Fuck, they're shooting at
us from the trail.

24:24.321 --> 24:27.255
- And where's it at?
- Now we're getting hit from our two o'clock.

24:29.292 --> 24:31.992
The Afghans came out
and tried to envelop us

24:31.994 --> 24:34.629
on both sides,
kinda like a bull's horns,

24:34.631 --> 24:38.035
and tried to enclose us in
and circle us on both sides.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.143
Now the Afghans,
they fight hard and they fight

24:48.145 --> 24:51.746
with no body armor, they fight
with no pay, no socks,

24:51.748 --> 24:53.114
some of them don't have
boot laces,

24:53.116 --> 24:54.983
I mean, they... they fight hard.

24:54.985 --> 24:57.052
It was kinda
inspiring to, to work

24:57.054 --> 25:00.088
with these Afghan guys who,
who did so much for so little.

25:03.860 --> 25:07.762
Damn! I'm out.
Gonna need more rounds, need more rounds.

25:07.764 --> 25:11.632
Terry's in the gun shooting,
he's focused on,

25:11.634 --> 25:13.767
uh, firing rounds
and suppressing the enemy.

25:16.206 --> 25:20.875
I thought to myself,
because the Mark 19 had a lot of them,

25:20.877 --> 25:22.844
"Maybe that will be
the next target".

25:22.846 --> 25:25.849
I yelled at them to move,
move, move from that place.

25:27.751 --> 25:29.086
Move, move forward.

25:39.063 --> 25:40.862
That was an RPG.

25:40.864 --> 25:44.732
After they moved,
fortunately, uh,

25:44.734 --> 25:47.069
they had that place
with the RPG,

25:47.071 --> 25:49.737
but the, uh,
Humvee was not there.

25:49.739 --> 25:53.674
And that was our ride back
also to go to the base.

25:53.676 --> 25:57.679
So, uh, to make sure
we don't have to walk.

26:13.897 --> 26:16.831
Ceasefire!
Ceasefire! Ceasefire!

26:16.833 --> 26:20.835
Over about a 45-minute period,
we were able to quell the contact.

26:20.837 --> 26:23.771
We thought the fight is finished.

26:23.773 --> 26:26.942
One of the company commanders,
he sent one of his platoon soldiers

26:26.944 --> 26:30.812
with the squad to go down see the damages.

26:30.814 --> 26:33.948
When those people came
back, they brought the flag

26:33.950 --> 26:36.819
of the Taliban, which was
on top of one of the compounds.

26:36.821 --> 26:40.054
So we're just taking some photos.

26:40.056 --> 26:45.361
The Taliban already had
the Afghan army radio scanned.

26:45.363 --> 26:48.730
They was listening the Afghan army
communications on their radio.

26:48.732 --> 26:52.301
One of the Taliban guy,
maybe their leader or one of their men,

26:52.303 --> 26:56.272
he called the call sign of the
platoon Sargent when he answered,

26:56.274 --> 26:59.110
and respond, "Yes",
and he start, uh...

27:00.278 --> 27:03.978
Uh, sorry to say that, he said,
"We're gonna fuck you guys up."

27:03.980 --> 27:06.114
Target in!

27:12.989 --> 27:16.158
At this point, we still
had integrity of our convoy,

27:16.160 --> 27:19.028
with an American vehicle
in the lead, uh,

27:19.030 --> 27:22.765
followed by five Afghan vehicles,
and then an American vehicle.

27:22.767 --> 27:26.535
The senior person on this convoy
was in the rear vehicle.

27:26.537 --> 27:31.374
And he asked Lieutenant Hall to have our vehicle

27:31.376 --> 27:35.012
maintain our position while they moved up.

27:36.214 --> 27:38.180
Some of his people got out,
Captain got out,

27:38.182 --> 27:40.517
went to aggress
and move to another building.

27:56.301 --> 28:02.905
Move, move, move!

28:02.907 --> 28:04.276
Hey, watch
your rifle, Lee!

28:08.045 --> 28:10.815
They got shot on,
leave it, leave it don't touch.

28:14.553 --> 28:18.488
- Oh my God, dude.
- Where's Gus! We need air support.

28:22.893 --> 28:24.594
We had been calling
for the Apaches for three hours.

28:24.596 --> 28:27.464
Now we were running out of ammo,
running out of fuel, and...

28:27.466 --> 28:30.233
but I was so focused
on what was going on, uh,

28:30.235 --> 28:33.804
I didn't really worry about what
could happen if they didn't come.

28:41.112 --> 28:45.017
<i>I'm out a little
bit further.</i>

28:46.285 --> 28:49.086
We get over the northern end
of the Tagab Valley,

28:50.021 --> 28:53.025
and, uh, we're circling,
circling would seem like...

28:54.126 --> 28:55.394
Oh man, at least 30 minutes.

28:56.762 --> 28:59.896
<i>I see smoke in the
one o'clock, about two miles.</i>

28:59.898 --> 29:02.967
<i>Okay, we're, uh, armed.
We're armed all the way around.</i>

29:04.001 --> 29:07.404
<i>Deadwood 6-7,
do you have eyes on the Humvee, over?</i>

29:07.406 --> 29:09.406
<i>There's a couple
of Humvees.</i>

29:09.408 --> 29:15.011
<i>Vandal 1-6, Vandal 1-6,
this is Deadwood 6-7,</i>

29:15.013 --> 29:17.949
<i>over east now.
This is your location</i>

29:19.984 --> 29:24.187
Sure enough, we find a convoy
that was engaged on an orchard

29:24.189 --> 29:26.458
on the other side of a ravine.

29:27.626 --> 29:31.094
<i>Vandal 1-6,
just give us the direction</i>

29:31.096 --> 29:34.132
<i>where you're taking fire from,
we can put down some fire.</i>

29:38.504 --> 29:40.440
<i>Roger, Deadwood 6-7, 8-1.</i>

29:43.308 --> 29:45.876
<i>God dammit, do you have eyes
on our location, over?</i>

29:47.647 --> 29:52.315
<i>We've got eyes on
several</i>

29:52.317 --> 29:57.356
<i>along the roadway, uh,
kind of hiding behind a wall.</i>

29:58.557 --> 30:02.961
<i>Roger, Deadwood 6-7,
that's us in the Humvee, over.</i>

30:04.364 --> 30:09.566
<i>Okay, here is the situation,
what you need is to put fire on them.</i>

30:09.568 --> 30:15.004
<i>Roger, they are in the
orchard to our east.</i>

30:15.006 --> 30:19.379
- <i>Anything you can fire up in there will be granted.</i>
- <i>Roll it out, rolling.</i>

30:20.413 --> 30:23.581
He's trying to direct us
where we need to put fire down on.

30:23.583 --> 30:26.283
It's a little more difficult
for us during the day

30:26.285 --> 30:29.186
to identify specifically where
they're being attacked from,

30:29.188 --> 30:33.156
because, you know, at night time you
can see where the rounds are coming off,

30:33.158 --> 30:37.294
you can see where the fires are coming
from, uh, you can utilize the flare,

30:37.296 --> 30:40.633
but it's more difficult during the day,
'cause you're primarily using your naked eye.

30:43.336 --> 30:46.470
<i>Roger and
there's smoking going on over here</i>

30:46.472 --> 30:49.941
<i>that could be a village, and the orchard
to the east that you're talking about.</i>

30:51.511 --> 30:56.381
<i>Roger that, 6-7, that's
go ahead and fire that up.</i>

30:58.150 --> 31:00.019
<i>Okay,
we're gonna put down so fire.</i>

31:03.523 --> 31:07.691
<i>Alright, go ahead. That was some good shooting
right there that kicked up all the dirt.</i>

31:07.693 --> 31:12.532
<i>Yep, I saw it.
OK, let's come around.</i>

31:13.466 --> 31:17.034
<i>Coming around
Are you gonna fire rockets...</i>

31:17.036 --> 31:18.702
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna
try and fire rockets on this.</i>

31:18.704 --> 31:21.104
<i>Okay, you fire rockets and then
I'll clean up a gun.</i>

31:21.106 --> 31:25.044
<i>I got the gun now.
Finger's on the trigger.</i>

31:27.280 --> 31:30.682
- <i>Follow our guys a little bit and shoot into it.</i>
- <i>Okay</i>

31:30.684 --> 31:36.420
- <i>Eh, come on, right.</i>
- <i>Alright, coming right. 6-1 to...</i>

31:41.327 --> 31:43.260
<i>OK, fire when you...</i>

31:43.262 --> 31:49.166
<i>1-6 and 1-6</i>

31:58.644 --> 32:01.078
That's when Vandal gets
on the radio saying like,

32:01.080 --> 32:02.681
"Who are you guys shooting at?

32:02.683 --> 32:05.752
We are a convoy
at the south end of the Tagab."

32:09.789 --> 32:12.691
"We're all standing behind this
wall and shooting to our east,

32:12.693 --> 32:16.260
is that what you're seeing?" He says,
"Yeah. It... Every shooting to the east".

32:16.262 --> 32:19.399
I'm, "Well, that's us,
but I don't see you."

32:24.570 --> 32:29.308
<i>6-7, Deadwood 6-7. I believe
we are south of your location, over.</i>

32:30.811 --> 32:35.847
- <i>Hold up on this round.</i>
- <i>Alright, holding up.</i>

32:35.849 --> 32:38.650
<i>Roger that. He said
they're south of our location.</i>

32:38.652 --> 32:42.152
<i>6-1, see what these
guys are doing right here.</i>

32:42.154 --> 32:45.792
- <i>Deadwood 6-7</i>
- <i>Get ready.</i>

32:48.695 --> 32:49.695
<i>Go ahead.</i>

32:50.597 --> 32:55.534
<i>W-D-5-8-1-5-5-</i>

32:55.536 --> 32:58.372
<i>6-0-4-3-0.</i>

33:01.375 --> 33:03.810
<i>Roger. Good copy.</i>

33:05.378 --> 33:09.748
I was talking to, uh,
Lieutenant Hall on the radio,

33:09.750 --> 33:11.485
the radio reception
was crystal clear,

33:12.653 --> 33:15.389
but we were not supporting him.
He was...

33:16.423 --> 33:19.560
What? Five or seven kilometers maybe
further south of where we were.

33:20.694 --> 33:23.395
Oh my God,
who did we just shoot?

33:23.397 --> 33:24.663
Shoot.

33:43.750 --> 33:46.151
There were three Afghans that were hurt.

33:46.153 --> 33:50.755
- <i>Over here! I saw two police!</i>
- <i>Where, where?</i>

33:50.757 --> 33:55.193
The Captain got on the
radio and he called for a Medivac.

33:55.195 --> 33:59.331
The Medivac indicated
that they would push one up,

33:59.333 --> 34:03.103
but they would not land until the area was secure.

34:04.538 --> 34:07.272
So the Captain indicated
to Lieutenant Hall

34:07.274 --> 34:10.476
that he was taking half
the Afghans in the ambulance

34:10.478 --> 34:13.344
and they were gonna roll back
to combat output in Nijrab.

34:13.347 --> 34:14.815
"And you continue the fight."

34:18.518 --> 34:22.320
Lieutenant Hall indicated he
did not think it was a good idea.

34:22.322 --> 34:27.960
I was, uh, very vocal from my position
that it was an absolutely horrible idea.

34:27.962 --> 34:30.732
They needed to understand they
still had ten people pinned down.

34:31.697 --> 34:35.400
They took away a big gun,
on top of that Humvee is a 50-cal.

34:35.402 --> 34:37.603
We have a Mark 19,
an automatic grenade launcher.

34:37.605 --> 34:40.304
You split those up,
and you don't have anybody

34:40.306 --> 34:43.411
to cover for him
while he's reloading.

34:44.478 --> 34:47.545
Reload. I'm out.
I need more rounds.

34:47.547 --> 34:49.614
You don't choose
who leads you

34:49.616 --> 34:52.818
in those situations.
They get force-fed to you,

34:52.820 --> 34:55.387
and my job
as an enlisted soldier,

34:55.389 --> 34:57.925
is to mitigate
the mistakes they make.

35:01.329 --> 35:03.596
The shots are coming
from right below us.

35:13.941 --> 35:16.776
They left us with only one American
vehicle and the American vehicles

35:16.778 --> 35:19.812
were out there because we had
the most fire power,

35:19.814 --> 35:22.248
and because we could
communicate with the skies.

35:38.399 --> 35:43.571
So, this was a month after my first
real deal claustrophobic anxiety attack.

35:44.639 --> 35:48.909
<i>There's trails and everything down
here, they could be hiding in all those trees.</i>

35:48.911 --> 35:55.048
It was on the back of my mind.
If I had a moment to stop and reflect...

35:55.050 --> 35:58.484
Yeah, here it comes.

35:58.486 --> 36:03.826
<i>Deadwood 6-7,
we are in convoy, we need evac out of here.</i>

36:32.520 --> 36:34.988
And that's when I started realizing,
that as long as I can keep

36:34.990 --> 36:38.390
my mind preoccupied
with something else,

36:38.392 --> 36:41.863
yeah, the chances of having an
anxiety attack was much, much less.

36:44.600 --> 36:50.570
- <i>Roger, Deadwood 7-6, I'm right underneath you.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

36:50.572 --> 36:53.339
What we actually wound up
flying over first

36:53.341 --> 36:55.909
was a ground QRF force,

36:55.911 --> 36:59.880
that had been sent out
from their base to go help them.

36:59.882 --> 37:04.750
And so we supported those guys at
first for a good 10-15 minutes or so,

37:04.752 --> 37:07.956
before we realized this is not
where we're supposed to be.

37:10.492 --> 37:14.663
<i>Deadwood 6-7,
we are in the last vehicle in this convoy.</i>

37:16.064 --> 37:18.064
<i>Roger,
we have eyes on you.</i>

37:18.066 --> 37:21.734
As soon as they got over the orchard
where the fighting was going on,

37:21.736 --> 37:27.408
sure enough there was a volley of
RPGs and smoke from all the shooting.

37:30.914 --> 37:33.747
I quickly slammed the stick
to the left, lined up my rockets

37:33.749 --> 37:36.650
and fired off three high
explosive rockets.

37:36.652 --> 37:39.553
<i>Oh yeah,
oh yeah, oh yeah.</i>

37:39.555 --> 37:42.589
And I tell you, right now,
that felt great.

37:52.134 --> 37:53.166
<i>Come on back.</i>

38:03.847 --> 38:07.082
<i>Going in
look good at this point.</i>

38:09.818 --> 38:11.685
<i>Go around, you're in
a good position, over.</i>

38:11.687 --> 38:19.060
<i>Here we go.</i>

38:19.062 --> 38:22.129
RPG, 0-8. Yeah!

38:22.131 --> 38:27.136
<i>Deadwood 6-7, we are still
receiving fire from our inside, over.</i>

38:28.570 --> 38:31.471
<i>north and
south so we get a little more to run.</i>

38:31.473 --> 38:33.540
<i>Yes, and that way
he's coming in that direction.</i>

38:33.542 --> 38:36.478
- <i>I agree with them. Coming out</i>
- <i>OK.</i>

38:50.026 --> 38:53.930
- <i>6-1 is inbound</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

39:20.555 --> 39:22.723
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Good round,</i>

39:22.725 --> 39:25.026
<i>Deadwood 6-7
you're right on target.</i>

39:25.028 --> 39:27.997
<i>Okay, 6-7, roger.</i>

39:31.534 --> 39:33.634
We had all our Afghans
in the trenches,

39:33.636 --> 39:36.670
so we had to get everybody,
find them all with no radios.

39:36.672 --> 39:38.973
Get them all back in the vehicles
and I'm calling, I'm trying

39:38.975 --> 39:41.776
to talk to the Afghans and I
don't know, I don't know Dari,

39:41.778 --> 39:45.012
so I'm trying to find my interpreter,
and he's up on the front line,

39:45.014 --> 39:47.583
you know,
taking ammo to the Afghans.

39:48.952 --> 39:52.753
I had to call him and...
and provide cover fire for him

39:52.755 --> 39:55.690
to start bounding back to me,
and I had to grab him

39:55.692 --> 39:58.726
by the collar and...
and try to yell at him,

39:58.728 --> 40:01.663
"Hey, I need you with me, man.
I need you to stay with me."

40:02.833 --> 40:06.035
We finally got everybody together,
you know, we started, started to move out.

40:08.738 --> 40:13.876
<i>Deadwood 6-7, we
are loading up to evac out of here, over.</i>

40:15.678 --> 40:16.646
<i>Roger.</i>

40:18.816 --> 40:24.018
There was about 500 enemy
insurgents in the valley at that time.

40:24.020 --> 40:28.991
When we came down, all the... the enemy
insurgents decided to come out to the road

40:28.993 --> 40:32.760
because they knew we'd have to come
back, and they laid in probably seven,

40:32.762 --> 40:35.631
eight ambushes for us
along those 17 kilometers.

40:41.070 --> 40:48.210
<i>Roger, Deadwood 6-7, we are in route and we
are gonna have ambushes all the way home.</i>

40:48.212 --> 40:50.812
- <i>OK, we're going with 'em.</i>
- <i>OK, we stay with 'em.</i>

40:50.814 --> 40:55.718
<i>Roger won't be, uh,
location as you are north.</i>

40:57.620 --> 41:00.789
I could see that they were
starting to head north along the road.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.326
I rolled in, flying as fast as I
could, catching up the convoy,

41:04.328 --> 41:07.796
and roasted over them
at about 100 feet,

41:07.798 --> 41:09.998
to let them know
that we were with them,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.833
and for any other possible
ambushes in front of them to know

41:12.835 --> 41:15.904
that there's Apaches that are
protecting our guys on the ground.

41:40.764 --> 41:42.266
<i>Do you copy, 1-6.</i>

41:48.038 --> 41:51.139
The next village they came
up to, looked literally

41:51.141 --> 41:55.311
like an old western town,
with a dirt road down the middle.

41:59.383 --> 42:02.886
It was a tight one lane
road, with buildings on either side.

42:15.299 --> 42:18.434
That's when Vandal 1-6

42:18.436 --> 42:20.902
screams down the radio that
they're shooting from the rooftops.

42:20.904 --> 42:27.076
- <i>Rooftops, get down! Over.</i>
- <i>Shit!</i>

42:30.080 --> 42:33.916
They were literally putting the gun
over the edge and just squeezing

42:33.918 --> 42:37.086
the trigger and letting,
letting them fly.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.754
<i>We can take out that house.
That's where they were shooting them from.</i>

42:39.756 --> 42:41.960
<i>I'm checking to see
where the shots came from.</i>

42:43.361 --> 42:48.464
I was in a position right there, just above
the town, saw one building and I thought,

42:48.466 --> 42:51.200
"Alright, I'm fixing to put a
rocket right through the top of it."

42:53.404 --> 42:56.707
<i>Okay, we're armed,
we're armed all the way around.</i>

43:00.478 --> 43:01.712
But it didn't feel right.

43:03.448 --> 43:05.383
- <i>He's got nowhere to go if he get shot at.</i>
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

43:10.455 --> 43:12.357
- <i>Alright, just get ready.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

43:16.227 --> 43:20.864
I eased off and circled around, I thought,
"Alright. Give them a little bit of time

43:21.933 --> 43:24.333
before I go make a shot and
possibly kill innocents in there."

43:24.335 --> 43:26.835
Because it's still, it's
a country where normal people

43:26.837 --> 43:28.939
that don't wanna be in this war.
That's where they live.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.310
So, in my mind,
that was a good...

43:33.478 --> 43:35.712
a good decision
not to take that shot.

43:37.882 --> 43:41.250
<i>He's pointing that
way somewhere, what the heck?</i>

43:41.252 --> 43:43.352
<i>Those guys are
right in front of us.</i>

43:43.354 --> 43:45.855
<i>Vandal to Deadwood.</i>

43:45.857 --> 43:48.291
<i>Roger. See if there's
anybody down there as well.</i>

43:48.293 --> 43:50.461
<i>I'm looking and lost.</i>

43:52.397 --> 43:56.265
So that's when I started
making runs up and down the road,

43:56.267 --> 43:58.303
popping flares
to let people know that,

43:59.370 --> 44:01.172
"You mess with them,
we will level this town".

44:02.874 --> 44:05.276
- <i>I'll send some flares</i>.
- <i>Go ahead. Roger.</i>

44:06.844 --> 44:09.314
<i>Power. Speed.</i>

44:14.553 --> 44:17.486
<i>And flares away.</i>

44:17.488 --> 44:20.357
<i>We're throwing
flares everywhere.</i>

44:26.031 --> 44:28.198
The Afghans stopped
because they're taking fire,

44:28.200 --> 44:31.234
and they got out of the vehicles
to try and engage.

44:36.141 --> 44:38.442
<i>Deadwood 6-7,
we have</i>

44:38.444 --> 44:44.581
- <i>We are loading up to evac out of here, over.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

44:44.583 --> 44:46.849
They were out fighting, because they
didn't wanna be in their vehicles,

44:46.851 --> 44:49.053
so we get them back in the
vehicles and we start moving again.

44:50.556 --> 44:51.888
2-40!

44:57.395 --> 44:59.930
Oh fuck! Go ahead!

44:59.932 --> 45:02.900
We need airborne!
We need airborne!

45:03.935 --> 45:08.605
We were close to being black on ammo,
meaning that we were out of ammo.

45:08.607 --> 45:12.275
I had used all my Mark 19
rounds, so the guys in the skies

45:12.277 --> 45:15.848
had the only rounds
that were really being fired.

45:16.548 --> 45:19.583
Considering how many people
were stacked up against them,

45:19.585 --> 45:22.019
they were sitting ducks.

45:29.160 --> 45:33.497
The FOB was not even a mile away
and that's when Vandal 1-6

45:33.499 --> 45:37.166
yells out, "They're shooting from the
fields, they're shooting from the field."

45:37.168 --> 45:41.238
<i>6-7, 6-7</i>

45:41.240 --> 45:44.441
<i>They're in the fields,
in the fields. Over.</i>

45:44.443 --> 45:48.646
<i>They're in the fields,
6-7, in the fields.</i>

45:48.648 --> 45:53.049
<i>Roger, in the fields. I got
it, it's gonna be a tight turn backing up.</i>

45:53.051 --> 45:57.187
<i>Right down below
us, 6-7, right down below us.</i>

45:57.189 --> 45:59.925
My front seater saw somebody
run into the fields shooting.

46:00.992 --> 46:03.396
- <i>Here we go. You see 'em?</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

46:06.665 --> 46:07.599
<i>I didn't see 'em.</i>

46:09.034 --> 46:11.269
<i>Good shot, 6-7,
good shot.</i>

46:11.271 --> 46:15.274
<i>I got it,
alright, coming left.</i>

46:18.345 --> 46:23.015
- <i>Left.</i>
- <i>Yeah, take a left turn, I saw the guys on the ground.</i>

46:24.483 --> 46:27.084
We'd gotten so good at this
point with shooting rockets

46:27.086 --> 46:31.922
that I could put a rocket in a
window at a mile away. No problem.

46:31.924 --> 46:33.524
<i>Alright, straight on.</i>

46:33.526 --> 46:38.563
- <i>Oh, nice.</i>
- <i>Right there, there you go.</i>

46:38.565 --> 46:41.566
<i>I'm out of, I'm out of...</i>

46:41.568 --> 46:43.969
<i>Good round, 6-7,
good round.</i>

46:44.671 --> 46:47.106
- <i>Roll out.</i>
- <i>Alright out.</i>

46:48.440 --> 46:52.145
By about that time the convoy
made up the last hill to the FOB.

47:09.027 --> 47:11.598
<i>6-7, it's 1-6,
we are in the FOB, over.</i>

47:19.238 --> 47:21.037
If we would not
have shown up

47:21.039 --> 47:22.308
at the time that we did,

47:23.576 --> 47:25.510
the chances are they would
have had a lot more casualties

47:25.512 --> 47:27.612
if not all of them
getting killed.

47:27.614 --> 47:32.118
They secured our safe passage
out of that valley.

47:33.686 --> 47:36.019
I mean we shot a lot
of ordinance that day,

47:36.021 --> 47:38.456
in those,
in those three and a half hours.

47:38.458 --> 47:40.591
Terry brought
700 rounds of grenades,

47:40.593 --> 47:44.062
700 grenades that he shot.

47:45.433 --> 47:48.599
The Afghan are an amazing
fighting force and, uh,

47:48.601 --> 47:52.938
Matt is the best battle buddy
I've ever had.

47:57.143 --> 47:59.243
If we would have had to
run back through that gauntlet,

47:59.245 --> 48:01.212
without cover fire,

48:01.214 --> 48:02.683
who knows how many people
would have made it back.

48:04.284 --> 48:07.086
We saved them that day,
we saved them that day.

48:22.035 --> 48:24.235
We got back
that night and...

48:24.237 --> 48:26.338
And we had flat tires

48:26.340 --> 48:27.606
and we had no ammo.

48:27.608 --> 48:29.507
We were tired,

48:29.509 --> 48:31.142
and there was a point where I...

48:31.144 --> 48:33.177
you know, I sat on a berm

48:33.179 --> 48:34.748
and just kinda looked out
into the distance.

48:35.649 --> 48:38.617
You know, I needed a minute.

48:38.619 --> 48:41.152
And, uh, Naser came up
and sat down and I said,

48:41.154 --> 48:43.789
"Hey, you know,
I... we fired a lot of grenades,

48:43.791 --> 48:48.092
and we fired a lot of guns and,
we, we shot a lot of things, and...

48:48.094 --> 48:51.697
Uh, I'm sure we killed some bad
guys, but I'm worried that we...

48:51.699 --> 48:56.534
Uh, that we killed, you know, maybe,
maybe women and children. I don't know.

48:56.536 --> 48:59.240
And he kind of put his hand on my
shoulder and said, "We did good today."

49:00.139 --> 49:03.474
You know? "We did, we did good,
you did good today."

49:03.476 --> 49:08.647
That was huge. That little
ten seconds probably saved

49:08.649 --> 49:12.550
a lot of, a lot of therapy
and issues for me later in life.

49:21.629 --> 49:24.164
<i>Got us here in the nick of time.</i>

49:27.701 --> 49:30.204
You know,
this is a whole lot of lightning going on.

49:31.705 --> 49:33.805
And actually it's fixing
to rain like crazy

49:33.807 --> 49:37.174
on us here in just a second.
We need, gonna get on a Hawk,

49:37.176 --> 49:39.578
to get back in this thing,
and here it comes.

49:46.220 --> 49:50.589
Um, like I said,
we didn't... we didn't make it.

49:50.591 --> 49:56.063
This is just like Jurassic Park, so as
long as we don't move, we should be okay.

49:56.764 --> 50:00.164
But it's raining like crazy
and we are,

50:00.166 --> 50:04.438
in bad guy country. Dust off,
the other Apache and us.

50:06.340 --> 50:09.411
I'm expecting a T-rex any minute
now, so we're not moving.

50:10.845 --> 50:14.513
And I'm scared.
Signing out for now.

50:19.821 --> 50:22.089
- Ahem, Chris, it's 2006.
- Hey.

50:24.692 --> 50:29.294
And what are we doing, all of us
from Texas? Shoveling snow.

50:29.296 --> 50:31.396
- Snow!
- You'd think we lived in Amarillo.

50:31.398 --> 50:33.802
That's true.

50:35.202 --> 50:38.639
Anyway, sometime in the middle of the
afternoon, it's snowing like crazy.

50:40.841 --> 50:47.114
And it's been snowing
all night, all... our Christmas.

50:48.749 --> 50:51.684
We had two weeks left
before we would start packing up

50:51.686 --> 50:55.322
and heading home after a yearlong
battle there in Afghanistan.

50:56.256 --> 50:58.393
The fighting had
increased tremendously.

50:59.561 --> 51:01.326
At the morning brief,
we got the weather for the day,

51:01.328 --> 51:03.763
and we got all the missions
that were going out.

51:03.765 --> 51:05.932
One of the missions
that I'd heard was

51:05.934 --> 51:09.435
taking The Code
to the Korengal Valley

51:09.437 --> 51:11.570
in a Black Hawk
to go visit the FOBs.

51:11.572 --> 51:14.273
The Code is the General.

51:23.618 --> 51:29.656
I was gonna spend Christmas
Eve of 2006 with Captain McKnight

51:29.658 --> 51:32.227
and his company,
up in the Korengal outpost.

51:33.595 --> 51:35.928
We had been collecting
all these letters...

51:35.930 --> 51:40.533
...to see the smiles on troops faces when they open

51:40.535 --> 51:43.770
a "to any soldier" letter, it
just makes a huge difference.

51:46.675 --> 51:50.576
Completely socked in,
snow, fog, everything.

51:50.578 --> 51:53.681
I told my aide, "Alright,
we're gonna go New Year's Eve.

51:53.683 --> 52:00.354
And snowed out, fogged out. And January
5th, 2007 was a crystal-clear day.

52:04.526 --> 52:08.260
<i>Alright, okay.</i>

52:08.262 --> 52:10.964
<i>Flight brakes released,
panels in, lock lights on.</i>

52:10.966 --> 52:14.000
- <i>System check?</i>
- <i>Systems, I got no crosses, no transfers.</i>

52:14.002 --> 52:17.905
<i>We're full of gas,
are green, 3000 hydraulics,</i>

52:17.907 --> 52:20.974
<i>no caution or warnings.
Supporting systems are checked. We're good.</i>

52:27.850 --> 52:32.285
The Korengal Valley was the most hotly
contested valley in all of Afghanistan.

52:32.287 --> 52:34.688
The Valley of Death
is what some people called it.

52:34.690 --> 52:37.592
Asher, I hear we're on the back
side of the.

52:40.595 --> 52:44.834
And we started heading to the east
towards Jalalabad and then north to Asadabad.

52:49.538 --> 52:52.906
Two types of people
that troops often

52:52.908 --> 52:56.411
talk about regarding
who you'll find in a firefight,

52:57.379 --> 53:03.951
are those that will immediately
return fire or initiate fire,

53:03.953 --> 53:07.087
because their training
kicks in and they execute,

53:07.089 --> 53:11.091
and then, you have some
that are more contemplative

53:11.093 --> 53:14.461
and take a step back
and, and hesitate,

53:14.463 --> 53:18.665
but I didn't see too many
of those. What I saw mostly

53:18.667 --> 53:24.938
were troops that whenever, uh,
we needed fire on target,

53:24.940 --> 53:27.741
uh, rounds on target.
They would put it on target,

53:27.743 --> 53:31.112
and there's no greater
demonstration of that

53:31.114 --> 53:34.617
than that January 5th, 2007 day.

53:37.753 --> 53:40.489
<i>Dog 3-7, Deadwood 6-6.</i>

53:41.557 --> 53:44.927
<i>Deadwood 6-6,
Dog 3-7 read your over.</i>

53:46.062 --> 53:49.398
<i>0-1-6-6, hear you loud and clear.
We're about one minute out.</i>

53:51.366 --> 53:53.002
<i>Dog,
copy that one minute out.</i>

53:54.403 --> 53:57.838
We got radio traffic saying
that there's a troops in contact,

53:57.840 --> 54:01.876
a fight going on in the Pech River
Valley, right before the Korengal Valley.

54:01.878 --> 54:05.512
So, we had to land at Asadabad
to let that fight play out,

54:05.514 --> 54:09.050
because we could not go past there.
At that point, The Code gets out,

54:09.052 --> 54:14.721
the Black Hawk runs into the TOC and a second
later, they call us up on the radio saying like,

54:14.723 --> 54:17.926
"Deadwood, can you go
over there to that TIC,

54:17.928 --> 54:21.595
and help stop it so we can
go on to the Korengal valley."

54:21.597 --> 54:23.897
I probably said like, "We're
the only Apache out here,

54:23.899 --> 54:26.935
we're not allowed to go single
ship anywhere in this country."

54:26.937 --> 54:29.803
And right about then is
when the TOC called up saying,

54:29.805 --> 54:32.107
"The Code has just authorized
you to go single ship."

54:36.046 --> 54:37.680
<i>OK, copy.
Be looking for them.</i>

54:44.653 --> 54:47.188
So, we took off,
talked to Dog 3-7 on the ground

54:47.190 --> 54:50.692
and he said, "Up on this ridge line,
the entrance of the Shuryak Valley,

54:50.694 --> 54:55.065
there's, uh, somebody's shooting at 'em with
RPGs and some, you know, small arms fire."

54:57.167 --> 55:00.969
<i>Hey, Dog this is Deadwood 6-6,
where are you at from me right now?</i>

55:00.971 --> 55:04.039
<i>Is that you, uh,
are you on the main road?</i>

55:06.743 --> 55:09.210
<i>Dog 3-7, negative,
we are at control base.</i>

55:09.212 --> 55:13.783
<i>We are east of you right now,
as you're flying, over.</i>

55:15.819 --> 55:18.585
<i>Okay, uh, let's
right now.</i>

55:18.587 --> 55:23.693
<i>Fly to is in, and they just gave
us southeast of that.</i>

55:25.996 --> 55:30.832
<i>Dog 3-7 to Deadwood 6-6.
Dog 3-7, over.</i>

55:30.834 --> 55:35.738
<i>Yes, that last coordinate that
you gave me, is that friendly or enemy?</i>

55:37.174 --> 55:42.045
<i>That's enemy. You are
safety. Over.</i>

55:44.147 --> 55:46.017
<i>Deadwood 6-6, roger.</i>

55:47.651 --> 55:53.590
<i>Okay, that's enemy position. Just run
on the nose, right there somewhere.</i>

55:55.159 --> 55:56.491
<i>And some rockets.</i>

56:18.748 --> 56:23.017
<i>This spot level, I don't like, but it
looks like somebody come back to get 'em.</i>

56:33.563 --> 56:35.967
<i>No, that is not working.</i>

56:37.934 --> 56:40.535
And that's when the,
the gun stopped shooting.

56:40.537 --> 56:43.606
We could hear it cycling,
but no bullets were coming out.

56:45.076 --> 56:47.809
- <i>Can't be out of rounds already.</i>
- <i>No way.</i>

56:47.811 --> 56:51.146
<i>Sounds like the gun was
running, but it wasn't firing.</i>

56:51.148 --> 56:52.515
<i>Oh Jeez.</i>

56:54.151 --> 56:58.053
<i>OK, Dog 3-7, Deadwood 6-6, either we're
out of bullets or our gun is broken.</i>

56:58.055 --> 57:03.194
<i>We're gonna get back to ABAD and continue with
the mission, we'll be back in a little bit.</i>

57:04.295 --> 57:06.764
<i>This is Dog 3-7, copy, over.</i>

57:09.100 --> 57:11.102
At that point,
we went back to Asadabad.

57:12.903 --> 57:17.006
The crew chiefs on the ground there, at Asadabad,
said like, "Hey, do you need any fuel?"

57:17.008 --> 57:21.643
And I said, "No, but could you check
the gun, see if it's broke or not?"

57:21.645 --> 57:25.147
So, they open the avionics bay
and they check the gun,

57:25.149 --> 57:27.749
and sure enough,
we're just out of bullets.

57:27.751 --> 57:32.354
So the kid comes back with a big
ammo can of 30 millimeter,

57:32.356 --> 57:35.157
and then they look at us
and that's when we find out

57:35.159 --> 57:40.029
that they don't have the proper equipment
to load the 30 millimeter bullets

57:40.031 --> 57:45.201
into the Apache. Unbeknownst to
us, that was taken away a week ago.

57:45.203 --> 57:48.370
Bullets, going into the Korengal
Valley was an absolute necessity.

57:48.372 --> 57:50.875
We had to have bullets.

57:51.808 --> 57:56.011
So, I suggested, "Hey, how about if
we fly back down to Jalalabad here,

57:56.013 --> 58:00.382
and, uh, get our guys to put bullets
in our Apache, refill us with gas,

58:00.384 --> 58:02.951
and we'll be back up here
45 minutes tops,

58:02.953 --> 58:05.154
and then we can go on
into the Korengal."

58:05.156 --> 58:08.858
At that point I saw the...
the Code getting out of the TOC,

58:08.860 --> 58:11.227
and running
and getting into his Black Hawk.

58:11.229 --> 58:14.730
And right at that point,
Ark Angel gets on the radio and says like,

58:14.732 --> 58:17.367
"Hey, you guys.
The Code's ready to go.

58:17.369 --> 58:20.272
You've got rockets and missiles,
let's go."

58:22.840 --> 58:28.045
<i>5-3-7, roger. I just got word
that the General</i>

58:29.713 --> 58:32.818
<i>says that you have to have
an escort with you, over.</i>

58:34.419 --> 58:37.822
- <i>Alright.</i>
- <i>Dog 3-7 copy, over.</i>

58:46.163 --> 58:50.902
<i>This really sucks not having...
us going in here.</i>

58:52.370 --> 58:58.374
So, I took off, Ark Angel, the Black Hawk
with the Code, takes off right behind me.

58:58.376 --> 59:01.010
Rolling straight
into the Korengal Valley.

59:13.725 --> 59:18.130
<i>Korengal outpost, Lumberyard, this is
Deadwood 6-6, getting down with the Code.</i>

59:19.864 --> 59:23.268
<i>This is Lumberyard COP
control, copy that, over.</i>

59:25.203 --> 59:30.206
I call up the Lumberyard,
or Korengal outpost, or the COP,

59:30.208 --> 59:33.044
tell 'em that, uh, it's
Deadwood inbound with the Code.

59:38.917 --> 59:42.784
<i>Go in, take left turn now,
I'm at your right five o'clock high.</i>

59:42.786 --> 59:46.091
<i>Roger that.</i>

59:48.326 --> 59:52.097
<i>Uh, don't go any further south,
make a left turn now, make a left turn now.</i>

59:53.865 --> 59:57.369
<i>Yeah, pick up your speed fast as you
can, really not good up here.</i>

59:58.403 --> 01:00:01.037
We're moving out at a
pretty good clip because we know

01:00:01.039 --> 01:00:04.307
that there's enemy in the area.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:07.410
Holes started appearing
in the side of the helicopter,

01:00:07.412 --> 01:00:10.214
which, you know, either rivets
are popping or somebody's

01:00:10.216 --> 01:00:13.283
shooting at us and of course,
it was the latter.

01:00:13.285 --> 01:00:17.887
And the left engine catches
on fire as we're landing,

01:00:17.889 --> 01:00:20.992
uh, hard landing
inside the Korengal outpost.

01:00:22.761 --> 01:00:25.329
So, they're on the ground
dropping off the Code and the package

01:00:25.331 --> 01:00:28.332
and whatever else they had,
and I'm circling overhead

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:32.035
and Lessum and myself, my copilot,
were discussing like, "Okay,

01:00:32.037 --> 01:00:35.139
we'll go back to Jalalabad, get
some bullets in this helicopter,

01:00:35.141 --> 01:00:38.009
and that should be about the time we
come back to pick up the... the Code."

01:00:38.944 --> 01:00:41.412
<i>All he's gotta do is
drop off and we go back to Abad.</i>

01:00:41.414 --> 01:00:43.846
<i>Yeah, as far as we
know that's all he's doing.</i>

01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:46.082
<i>You know, we ought
to, I don't know how much time</i>

01:00:46.084 --> 01:00:49.453
<i>they've got, but, I think
we can run down to ABAD,</i>

01:00:49.455 --> 01:00:54.092
<i>and get, get bullets.</i>

01:00:55.327 --> 01:00:56.829
<i>Would be nice, wouldn't it?</i>

01:01:00.899 --> 01:01:04.133
At that point,
they came under attack.

01:01:04.135 --> 01:01:05.805
Oh my god!

01:01:14.113 --> 01:01:17.481
Now we're in full-fledged
ambush. There's rocket,

01:01:17.483 --> 01:01:21.252
propel grenades, criss-crossing
like Roman Candles.

01:01:21.254 --> 01:01:23.954
Open it up, open it up!

01:01:23.956 --> 01:01:26.791
And there's machine
gun rounds coming in.

01:01:27.859 --> 01:01:28.794
Eh!

01:01:34.866 --> 01:01:38.402
Captain McKnight comes
running up and, and grabs me

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:41.372
by the body armor and says,

01:01:41.374 --> 01:01:45.209
"Sir, the last thing I need is
a dead general in my base camp."

01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:47.478
Go, get out, get out!

01:01:52.117 --> 01:01:55.521
Coming down the hill,
the young man named Sergeant Vile.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:59.225
And Sergeant Vile gets shot.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.465
He gets up, ties up his own
tourniquet and we all go piling

01:02:08.467 --> 01:02:13.172
into the command post,
be that what it was.

01:02:17.076 --> 01:02:21.245
The Korengal outpost
was under pretty significant

01:02:21.247 --> 01:02:22.946
contact at this time.

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:24.982
Here you go.

01:02:24.984 --> 01:02:27.251
And I'm watching
Sergeant Vile,

01:02:27.253 --> 01:02:30.020
who is starting
to go into shock.

01:02:30.022 --> 01:02:34.326
But he was a mortar ballistic computer
operator, he had a very important job.

01:02:34.328 --> 01:02:38.564
He has a radio and he's punching numbers
into his mortar ballistic computer,

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:42.400
and his left arm
was severely wounded.

01:02:42.402 --> 01:02:45.171
There was blood dripping
on the plywood floor.

01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:49.474
I tapped the medic and say,
"You need to check him out,

01:02:49.476 --> 01:02:53.545
he's getting ready to go into shock".
Because he was visibly shaking.

01:02:53.547 --> 01:02:57.082
And, uh, the medic sort of
smirked at me and says,

01:02:57.084 --> 01:03:00.585
"You don't know Sergeant Vile,
sir." And I said,

01:03:00.587 --> 01:03:04.188
"That may be, but, you know,
he looks like he's gonna...", and so...

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:09.059
The medic goes over, I guess not wanting to upset the General

01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:13.298
and Sergeant Vile turns at him and growls,
you know, and get the F away from me.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.101
And this is, you know, the beauty

01:03:16.103 --> 01:03:20.239
of the American soldier is that he
didn't wanna let his teammates down.

01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:34.488
At this point, there's a string of bullets
coming at me between myself and Ark Angel.

01:03:36.455 --> 01:03:40.427
<i>Oh shit, what was that?
There, they are right there.</i>

01:03:42.496 --> 01:03:46.464
I rolled in hard left, and I
thought, "Jeez, I have no bullets."

01:03:46.466 --> 01:03:49.300
At that point, I could
not go to our rocket shops

01:03:49.302 --> 01:03:52.471
because the Korengal outpost
was right on the other side.

01:03:52.473 --> 01:03:54.474
- <i>See that smoke right there?</i>
- <i>Yeah, shit.</i>

01:03:56.176 --> 01:04:01.281
<i>Yeah, you're taking fire, just, uh, I
don't know if you saw it, it was left low.</i>

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:07.685
I squeezed over and I said,
"I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you."

01:04:07.687 --> 01:04:11.358
Shoved the helicopter over into a
negative G push, squeezed that trigger.

01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:15.393
- <i>It was right there. Right there, right there.</i>
- <i>Woah!</i>

01:04:18.699 --> 01:04:19.700
<i>Come on.</i>

01:04:21.668 --> 01:04:25.604
Nothing was coming out,
I was in a one and a half negative G push.

01:04:25.606 --> 01:04:29.276
The safety inhibit on the Apache keeps
me from firing rockets at that point.

01:04:30.677 --> 01:04:36.214
You could see flashes of everybody
shooting at us from that ridgeline.

01:04:36.216 --> 01:04:38.418
Was like the paparazzi
was right in front of us.

01:04:41.289 --> 01:04:43.489
I pull back on the stick

01:04:43.491 --> 01:04:46.660
at that time to get out of a
stream of gunfire coming at me.

01:04:48.028 --> 01:04:51.564
That's when I saw my... my wife

01:04:51.566 --> 01:04:55.400
and my kids at the front
of the door of our house...

01:04:57.772 --> 01:05:01.039
...thinking that...

01:05:01.041 --> 01:05:04.510
"How could dad have gotten killed
with less than two weeks left?"

01:05:08.816 --> 01:05:13.287
And then I looked and I saw my
daughter smiling saying, "No, uh...

01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:16.357
It's not gonna happen."

01:05:23.364 --> 01:05:26.732
My copilot says, "Daniel, you're hyperventilating."

01:05:26.734 --> 01:05:30.236
That was the point where like I thought, "No stop."

01:05:30.238 --> 01:05:32.738
Finally, I breathe again.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.306
So now, I'm trying
to line up the nose

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:38.746
and trying to get at least a half
a positive G to get a rocket out.

01:05:46.554 --> 01:05:47.688
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:53.762
And sure enough by the grace of God, I fire
one rocket and it goes right, center mass.

01:05:54.729 --> 01:06:00.534
<i>Combat Main, Combat Main. They were
just shooting at us underneath me right now.</i>

01:06:00.536 --> 01:06:05.239
<i>Combat main, they were just shooting at
us, just now. Did you see 'em?</i>

01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:08.510
<i>That was a big gun.</i>

01:06:10.646 --> 01:06:12.745
<i>Yeah, I saw some
big traces coming around here.</i>

01:06:12.747 --> 01:06:15.514
<i>It was a big
machinegun shooting</i>

01:06:15.516 --> 01:06:18.252
<i>traces out of the next spot and
we were not allowed to shoot.</i>

01:06:19.821 --> 01:06:23.155
Come back around, screaming on the
radio, telling the Korengal outpost,

01:06:23.157 --> 01:06:26.392
"We're taking fire from this spot.
Get a fire mission going."

01:06:31.566 --> 01:06:35.602
You hear the loud funk
of the mortar go off.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.741
The hang time's
probably about a minute.

01:06:41.743 --> 01:06:45.845
It's just silent in there except from
some of the machinegun rounds coming in.

01:06:45.847 --> 01:06:49.349
But nobody was talking
and you hear the explosion.

01:06:52.854 --> 01:06:54.854
The machinegun rounds stop.

01:06:54.856 --> 01:06:56.756
Vile gets confirmation

01:06:56.758 --> 01:06:59.158
of a first round direct hit.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.896
He pushes the mortar ballistic
computer across the picnic table

01:07:02.898 --> 01:07:06.366
to his private. He turns
to the medic and he says,

01:07:06.368 --> 01:07:08.369
"Now you can work on me."

01:07:09.705 --> 01:07:13.342
At that point, I could see
the Taliban running on the ridgeline.

01:07:14.543 --> 01:07:19.647
<i>Deadwood 6-6, we're engaged right now, we got
them, we got them straight in front of us.</i>

01:07:20.716 --> 01:07:25.417
And that's just when I begin to fire as
fast as I could, all the rockets I could,

01:07:25.419 --> 01:07:29.623
and actually remembering a World
War II pilot that I know, saying,

01:07:29.625 --> 01:07:31.858
"Wiggle the pedals back
and forth a little bit, that way

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.428
all your rockets
won't end up in one spot".

01:07:35.463 --> 01:07:38.498
I wiggled the pedals just a little bit right
and left, as I'm squeezing the rockets

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.235
and making my rockets hit
everywhere around them.

01:07:42.638 --> 01:07:43.903
- Fucking...
- There we go.

01:07:50.746 --> 01:07:56.683
<i>Deadwood 6-6, we got up on that spot. Combat
Main. Lumberyard, permission to.</i>

01:07:56.685 --> 01:07:59.719
Swing back around again, we're
running out of high explosive rockets.

01:07:59.721 --> 01:08:04.524
We start shooting
flechettes, 2000

01:08:04.526 --> 01:08:08.294
two-inch nails coming
at those guys ripping into them.

01:08:21.542 --> 01:08:23.910
After that, run out
of flechettes, come back around

01:08:23.912 --> 01:08:25.782
and I start shooting
white phosphorous.

01:08:31.386 --> 01:08:34.823
At that point,
I have nothing left.

01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:39.259
I call the... the, uh, Korengal
outpost, tell them like,

01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:41.731
"We are Winchester.
We are out of here."

01:08:43.765 --> 01:08:50.037
- <i>Alright, Deadwood 6-6, Winchester, we're out of here.</i>
- <i>Roger that, over.</i>

01:08:50.038 --> 01:08:52.706
<i>Fuck, why wouldn't that rocket
shoot on that first run? Damn it,</i>

01:08:52.707 --> 01:08:56.477
<i>that pisses me off.
And no gun. Dammit of all the...</i>

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.247
<i>Oh yeah, of all the times
not having a fucking gun, man.</i>

01:09:04.886 --> 01:09:05.888
<i>Yes.</i>

01:09:06.988 --> 01:09:11.457
The heroism of both
the Black Hawk crew

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:16.663
and the, uh, Apache crew,
was just unbelievable.

01:09:16.666 --> 01:09:19.399
They stayed on station

01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:21.904
when it was so risky,
so dangerous,

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.707
to help the troops
on the ground.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.411
<i>Alright, you sure
you guys did not take a hit</i>

01:09:30.412 --> 01:09:31.913
<i>cause they were shooting
all over you.</i>

01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:36.018
<i>Yeah 1-32, we took a hit, our
generator's out and our stabilizers out.</i>

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:40.787
<i>We're totally viable
but we're gonna have to shut down</i>

01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:43.756
<i>and take a look at it
when we get to ABAD.</i>

01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:48.631
<i>We're gonna have to fly around and
get another aircraft for.</i>

01:09:49.599 --> 01:09:51.598
<i>Sounds good.</i>

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.003
Much later that evening, they
sent, uh, another Black Hawk out

01:09:56.005 --> 01:10:01.509
to recover my team and me.
You know, I had five other stops

01:10:01.511 --> 01:10:05.079
I was gonna make that day, but that,
that sort of changed the whole dynamic

01:10:05.081 --> 01:10:09.350
of the visit
and so all the "to any soldier",

01:10:09.352 --> 01:10:11.819
uh, packages and letters,
they all stayed right there.

01:10:14.123 --> 01:10:16.557
We put Sergeant Vile
on our aircraft

01:10:16.559 --> 01:10:18.960
and medivacked him to Bagram.

01:10:18.962 --> 01:10:24.565
And before he got evacked, I pinned on his purple heart.

01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:28.602
He's a personal hero of mine today.

01:10:28.604 --> 01:10:33.809
This was the best teamwork I've ever seen.
It was completely unrehearsed,

01:10:33.811 --> 01:10:37.814
it was all instinctual. These pilots knew
what to do, the soldiers knew what to do.

01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:44.652
It was one of those days where I was never
prouder to be an American fighting soldier.

01:10:44.654 --> 01:10:50.058
Because everybody did their job
above and beyond the call of duty,

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:53.961
and avoided
what really could have been

01:10:53.963 --> 01:10:57.499
a catastrophic type of event.

01:10:57.501 --> 01:11:00.938
It was just
an incredible sight to see.

01:11:44.781 --> 01:11:49.985
It was a, a moment a few
years ago when he had, uh...

01:11:49.987 --> 01:11:53.089
tweaked his elbow pretty bad
and he was in a cast,

01:11:53.091 --> 01:11:56.591
and we were all just sitting
in here watching TV one night,

01:11:56.593 --> 01:12:00.997
and he just started sweating
profusely and got up and just...

01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:03.832
pacing around the room
and cussing saying,

01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:05.901
"I need to get out of this,
I need to get out of this cast

01:12:05.903 --> 01:12:07.969
right now, they need
to take this off."

01:12:07.971 --> 01:12:10.805
'Cause he was having an anxiety
attack from being claustrophobic.

01:12:10.807 --> 01:12:14.209
Then I started to think about it
more and looking back at like,

01:12:14.211 --> 01:12:17.746
when we were in Colorado
and packed into that gondola,

01:12:17.748 --> 01:12:21.650
packed in the long car rides
where you would start to notice

01:12:21.652 --> 01:12:25.553
he's a little off about something,
but he's trying to hide it,

01:12:25.555 --> 01:12:29.824
but he can't just quite do it.
It did humanize him a little bit

01:12:29.826 --> 01:12:34.663
to see him act this way,
you know, have this episode.

01:12:34.665 --> 01:12:39.534
But, uh, for the most part, I mean,
it was maybe two minutes of that,

01:12:39.536 --> 01:12:43.239
and then he calmed right back down,
and just sat back down and said,

01:12:43.241 --> 01:12:46.975
"Alright, I need to call the doctors tomorrow,
tell 'em to help me out with this",

01:12:46.977 --> 01:12:50.212
and then, we just went right back to
watching whatever we were watching.

01:12:50.214 --> 01:12:54.015
For a while there it was pretty
intense and with the cast thing,

01:12:54.017 --> 01:12:58.988
like Eric was talking about earlier,
on his arm, that surprised me also.

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:01.556
I really never have even thought
about something like that.

01:13:01.558 --> 01:13:05.527
I was thinking more of, you know,
the gondola, being in an enclosed space,

01:13:05.529 --> 01:13:08.965
kind of made sense to me,
but having something on your arm,

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:11.533
didn't really make any sense,
why that would bother him.

01:13:11.535 --> 01:13:15.137
He wrote this book and it, you know,
maybe thousands of people are gonna read

01:13:15.139 --> 01:13:18.773
and he's talking about it just
like it's a normal thing, but he...

01:13:18.775 --> 01:13:21.110
didn't quite talk about it
to everyone at home.

01:13:21.112 --> 01:13:25.647
And, uh, it was a little off-putting,
you know, reading it, but I mean,

01:13:25.649 --> 01:13:29.952
you understand it's a part of it and it's
a part of the story that he needs to tell.

01:13:42.866 --> 01:13:46.302
- Hey, you must be Matt.
- I'm Matt, nice to meet you.

01:13:46.304 --> 01:13:48.070
- Good to meet you, Ross Hovey.
- Hey Ross.

01:13:48.072 --> 01:13:50.672
- Ross, man.
- Good to see you, brother.

01:13:50.674 --> 01:13:52.842
- It's been a while.
- Yeah, great to see you.

01:13:52.844 --> 01:13:54.677
And who are these guys?

01:13:54.679 --> 01:13:58.147
Naser, my buddy. How are you?
Good to see you, Ross.

01:13:58.149 --> 01:14:01.884
- Naser, I'm Daniel, nice to meet you, brother.
- I'm Terry.

01:14:01.886 --> 01:14:04.820
Terry, nice to meet you, man, it's been years.

01:14:04.822 --> 01:14:08.191
- Yeah, I know, for sure.
- And you were the translator, is that right?

01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:10.327
- I was the translator.
- OK, yeah.

01:14:10.329 --> 01:14:12.261
That is too good,
and he was the door guy or...

01:14:12.263 --> 01:14:14.629
I was the gunner
up top the Mark 19.

01:14:14.631 --> 01:14:17.867
- He was the gunner, he was backseat and I was the TC.
- Alright.

01:14:17.869 --> 01:14:19.168
- So, Vandal 1-6.
- Yep.

01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:20.903
1-7.

01:14:20.905 --> 01:14:22.638
- And Naser.
- I was relaxing in the backseat.

01:14:23.942 --> 01:14:26.343
He was handing
the rounds up to me.

01:14:26.345 --> 01:14:28.878
That's pretty good,
I like that. Yeah.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.313
Well guys, you wanna
just step inside the bar,

01:14:31.315 --> 01:14:33.818
we can just hang out, grab a...
grab a cold drink if you'd like?

01:14:35.354 --> 01:14:39.923
A toast to our Afghanistan team,
our army family and friends

01:14:39.925 --> 01:14:43.060
and all those that didn't get to come back.
That didn't make it home safe.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:46.162
I remember that captain,

01:14:46.164 --> 01:14:49.698
from the 2-6 cab, he said like,
"Guys, everything's heating up

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:53.270
there in the Korengal and the
Pech, but don't forget the Tagab,

01:14:53.272 --> 01:14:56.807
'cause it is about
to explode and, uh,

01:14:56.809 --> 01:14:59.109
I thought ah, whatever.
Same thing, flew over it all year long.

01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:01.077
Two months after that,
I've forgotten what he's said

01:15:01.079 --> 01:15:05.115
and then all of a sudden one day
we're on QRF and they say,

01:15:05.117 --> 01:15:07.817
"We gotta take a tog out",
and I'm like,

01:15:07.819 --> 01:15:11.220
"Really? There's something going on?
There's firefighting in the Takab?"

01:15:11.222 --> 01:15:16.126
I say, "There's a convoy that's
been ambushed, and there's 200

01:15:16.128 --> 01:15:19.228
Taliban out there
that are surrounding them."

01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:21.698
I can't remember how long
it was, but it had to have been

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.202
five to ten minutes we were
supporting that QRF team.

01:15:25.204 --> 01:15:27.236
And that it?
It felt like five hours.

01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:30.209
I thought the same thing too.

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:34.144
I... I was looking up to the sky,
I'm like, "You guys are saying,

01:15:34.146 --> 01:15:36.713
'Hey I'm dropping rounds.'"
I'm like,

01:15:36.715 --> 01:15:39.416
"I don't see you,
let alone your rounds."

01:15:39.418 --> 01:15:41.851
That's hit me in the leg.

01:15:41.853 --> 01:15:44.688
Like you were saying, there were
ambushes all the way up there.

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:46.823
- Yeah, you didn't shoot anybody...
- That didn't need shooting.

01:15:46.825 --> 01:15:50.360
...that were up to good. They
were actually after our QRF.

01:15:50.362 --> 01:15:52.330
We were in the business of killing
and right then, business was good.

01:15:52.332 --> 01:15:55.265
All I could tell was,
that there was American

01:15:55.267 --> 01:15:58.701
made vehicles with A&A men in
them and they were under attack.

01:15:58.703 --> 01:16:01.838
Yeah, we started moving up and as
we started moving up, uh, you know,

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.408
it was literally seven different
ambushes waiting for us.

01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:07.978
They were laying on top,
not accurate firing,

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.414
but to hide themselves
in firing,

01:16:10.416 --> 01:16:16.953
when we got back, I had a 8k round
in between my vest and my dune.

01:16:16.955 --> 01:16:19.322
- Wow!
- That's I mean, so you know we were like, "Oh my gosh".

01:16:19.324 --> 01:16:22.926
- Holy mackerel!
- And yeah, they were, it was crazy.

01:16:22.928 --> 01:16:29.065
God bless the A&A, they would always
leave us in the Humvee sick.

01:16:29.067 --> 01:16:33.237
We had... I had to get Naser out and say,
tell them to move up, move up, move up.

01:16:33.239 --> 01:16:37.908
One of the Taliban, he already...
he was like, uh, the radio channel

01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:41.112
of the enemy because he was
scanning the communication.

01:16:41.114 --> 01:16:45.817
He called one of the sergeants, which he called
me, he took his handset, he answered, "Yes".

01:16:46.752 --> 01:16:48.119
Oh yeah?

01:16:48.121 --> 01:16:51.322
He said, "I'm gonna
fuck you all up."

01:16:53.325 --> 01:16:56.294
So, all you guys alive,
that's what the Taliban said.

01:16:56.296 --> 01:16:58.697
- Wow, it's just...
- Kudos.

01:17:03.404 --> 01:17:08.404
