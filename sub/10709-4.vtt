00:19.949 --> 00:21.715
Miss McCabe! Stop!

00:21.815 --> 00:23.252
I'm not letting you put me away!

00:57.290 --> 00:58.391
Stop!

00:58.491 --> 01:01.589
I know, I know,
I've failed my city.

01:16.653 --> 01:19.656
- Hold her!
- Does it look like I'm not trying?

01:49.918 --> 01:52.521
She can teleport. That is so cool.

01:52.621 --> 01:54.113
It's not teleportation.

01:54.213 --> 01:56.438
You never believe in superpowers.

02:02.483 --> 02:03.978
Camouflage!

02:04.674 --> 02:06.255
Still, equally cool.

02:06.355 --> 02:08.392
- Move fast!
- What I do.

02:19.282 --> 02:20.616
Oh, crap!

02:33.215 --> 02:36.257
Okay. That is actually
cooler than teleportation.

02:39.328 --> 02:41.938
Enough!
We're not putting you in jail.

02:42.038 --> 02:43.398
We just wanna talk.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.593
<i>Just talk.</i>

02:46.772 --> 02:50.078
Let me handle this. I kinda
have a rapport with meta-humans.

02:50.178 --> 02:52.312
You throw them
in your Pipeline prison.

02:52.412 --> 02:53.913
Not helping.

02:55.312 --> 02:56.587
Meta-humans?

02:56.687 --> 03:00.026
People who got powers
as a result of exposure to fallout

03:00.126 --> 03:02.441
from the S.T.A.R. Labs
particle accelerator explosion.

03:02.541 --> 03:04.485
Yeah, sorry to burst your bubble,

03:04.585 --> 03:07.200
but I wasn't even in Central City
when that went down.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.678
Felicity, you there?

03:08.778 --> 03:11.525
Just me and my fern,
or your fern,

03:11.625 --> 03:14.180
though, let's be honest -
I'm the one who waters it.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.776
- Tell her I said hi.
- Hi, Barry!

03:15.876 --> 03:18.334
Mari McCabe. I need to know whether
she was in Central City

03:18.435 --> 03:20.934
the night of December 11th, 2013.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.626
Miss McCabe was in Detroit

03:23.726 --> 03:25.936
the night
of the particle accelerator explosion.

03:26.036 --> 03:28.322
At least her credit card
was at the Big Belly Burger.

03:28.422 --> 03:30.576
She has a thing for their
iceberg shake.

03:30.676 --> 03:31.867
She wasn't in Central City.

03:31.967 --> 03:35.167
That's not possible!
What we've seen her do is not possible.

03:35.267 --> 03:37.743
A lot of people would say
what you do is impossible.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.245
I mean without reaction
to a dark matter explosion.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.750
What I can do -
I think it's magic.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.011
But it's not against the law,

03:44.103 --> 03:46.511
so I really don't see
what business I am of yours.

03:46.611 --> 03:49.818
My colleague has friends
who can help people like yourself.

03:49.918 --> 03:50.661
Look,

03:50.761 --> 03:54.399
the only thing I give a damn about
is nothing you two can help me with.

03:54.499 --> 03:56.030
Why not give us a try?

03:56.130 --> 03:57.822
We're actually pretty resourceful.

03:57.922 --> 03:59.857
Show up at my father's house,

03:59.957 --> 04:01.907
and you're gonna get
a really good idea

04:02.007 --> 04:04.400
of what it's like
to be disemboweled by a lion.

04:08.105 --> 04:10.009
I think that went pretty well.

04:10.109 --> 04:11.161
How do you figure?

04:11.261 --> 04:12.977
Usually, when I meet a meta
for the first time,

04:13.078 --> 04:14.562
I get beat up a little.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.304
- I need to talk to you.
- Is everything all right?

04:23.503 --> 04:24.772
Yes...

04:25.842 --> 04:27.079
No.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.777
I'm not sure. I'm...

04:28.877 --> 04:31.144
It's okay. It's okay.
What's going on?

04:31.244 --> 04:33.505
It's hard to explain, but, well...

04:33.606 --> 04:34.844
There are two men after me.

04:34.944 --> 04:37.803
- Did you call the police?
- It's not that kind of situation.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.302
I need you to help me find out
where this came from,

04:40.402 --> 04:42.781
how I got it, who gave it to me.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.850
What makes you think I could help you
with any of those things?

04:49.391 --> 04:51.633
I know you said
this was all just myth.

04:51.733 --> 04:54.613
I'm really hoping that's
the last thing you're wrong about.

04:54.713 --> 04:58.065
I'm sorry, Mari.
I'm very sorry about this.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.266
About what?

05:02.995 --> 05:06.699
I tried to do this in other way, Mari.
A more subtle way.

05:06.799 --> 05:10.670
But your surprising capacity
has given me no choice.

05:10.870 --> 05:15.048
Hand me the totem, or
I will have one of these men kill you.
