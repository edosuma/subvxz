00:36.360 --> 00:41.165
Karen?

00:41.199 --> 00:45.504
<i>â™ª Karen â™ª</i>

00:45.537 --> 00:48.005
Come on, wake up.

00:48.039 --> 00:50.609
Why?

00:50.642 --> 00:55.279
I need inspiration.

00:55.313 --> 01:00.318
Is it working?

01:01.118 --> 01:06.123
You're beautiful.

01:15.132 --> 01:20.137
You're so young.

01:22.808 --> 01:26.512
You're gonna break my heart.

01:26.545 --> 01:31.215
I've never broken
one single heart.

01:31.249 --> 01:35.754
I don't believe you.

01:35.787 --> 01:37.456
I swear.

01:37.489 --> 01:42.494
Girl scout.

02:14.392 --> 02:16.160
The mailbox
is full and cannot accept any

02:16.193 --> 02:17.462
messages at this time.

02:17.496 --> 02:22.501
Goodbye.

02:47.793 --> 02:48.894
Hi, Ramsey.

02:49.828 --> 02:52.431
You wanna come with me?

02:53.297 --> 02:56.133
Shh.

02:56.167 --> 02:58.135
Fuck!

02:58.804 --> 02:59.471
Shh.

02:59.504 --> 03:03.742
I know, I know.

07:02.781 --> 07:05.617
Hello, little.

07:05.650 --> 07:08.920
I'm here at the
lake house again.

07:08.954 --> 07:12.423
And I hope you'll forgive me.

07:12.457 --> 07:14.926
I'll bring you here
again sometime soon.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.965
I promise.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.469
And I hope you'll forgive me.

07:24.502 --> 07:27.138
I'll bring you here
again sometime soon.

07:27.172 --> 07:32.344
I promise.

07:33.645 --> 07:36.715
Hello, little.

07:36.748 --> 07:41.753
I'm here at the
lake house again.

12:17.795 --> 12:19.931
What are you doing?

12:19.964 --> 12:23.334
You scared me.

12:23.368 --> 12:26.371
Have you seen a dog?

12:26.404 --> 12:28.840
My dog's missing.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.741
I'll keep an eye out.

12:29.774 --> 12:32.410
Could you drive me
around to look for him?

12:32.444 --> 12:35.013
I'm gonna be in so much
trouble if I don't find him.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.414
It's
going to be dark soon.

12:36.448 --> 12:38.883
Just until it gets dark.

12:38.917 --> 12:42.754
You shouldn't just ask
for rides from strangers.

12:42.787 --> 12:44.222
What's your name?

12:44.255 --> 12:47.125
Karen.

12:47.158 --> 12:52.163
Now you're not a stranger.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.502
You're from LA, right?

12:56.535 --> 12:58.136
Yup.

12:58.169 --> 13:02.373
That's so cool.

13:02.407 --> 13:06.744
I'm gonna be an actress.

13:17.388 --> 13:20.992
I'm really about shaving.

13:21.025 --> 13:24.496
Are you?

13:24.530 --> 13:29.734
I don't know.

13:29.968 --> 13:34.973
You're good at it.

13:42.013 --> 13:44.516
Maybe you should try
looking again in the morning.

13:44.550 --> 13:48.554
Oh my God,
these guys are always here.

13:48.587 --> 13:49.821
Hey!

13:54.560 --> 13:56.894
Do you even have a dog?

13:56.928 --> 13:58.129
What?

13:58.162 --> 13:59.797
Do you?

13:59.831 --> 14:02.468
Why would I lie about
something like that?

14:02.501 --> 14:04.570
I don't know.

14:04.603 --> 14:09.807
Well, I'm not.

14:11.543 --> 14:14.345
We just passed him!

14:14.379 --> 14:15.813
I'm serious, I saw him!

14:15.847 --> 14:20.852
Stop!

14:24.122 --> 14:28.293
Damn!

14:28.326 --> 14:31.463
Bingo!

14:31.497 --> 14:36.502
Come here, Bingo!

14:36.535 --> 14:41.540
Shit.

14:43.207 --> 14:46.210
Come on, Bingo!

14:46.244 --> 14:48.112
Come here, boy!

14:48.146 --> 14:51.483
No one actually names
their dog "Bingo," by the way.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.952
If you don't believe
me, why don't you just leave?

14:54.986 --> 14:57.855
Come here, boy!

14:57.889 --> 15:02.628
Come on, Bingo!

15:41.467 --> 15:46.472
I'll be damned.

15:48.172 --> 15:50.542
Why would you leave me, huh?

15:50.576 --> 15:52.009
Don't you love me?

15:52.043 --> 15:54.412
Where do you live?

15:54.446 --> 15:57.048
You can just
drop us off at your place.

15:57.081 --> 15:57.882
It's late.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.984
Your parents are
probably worried.

16:00.017 --> 16:04.422
I don't live with my parents.

16:04.456 --> 16:09.461
Okay.

16:10.462 --> 16:13.197
You have a dog too?

16:13.231 --> 16:16.267
Yeah, someone took him.

16:16.300 --> 16:20.271
If anyone ever took
Bingo, I'd kill 'em.

16:20.304 --> 16:25.309
Yes, I would.

16:41.460 --> 16:46.465
Let's go!

17:17.796 --> 17:20.364
I'm Lana, by the way.

17:20.397 --> 17:22.468
See you tomorrow.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.001
What's tomorrow?

17:24.035 --> 17:29.040
Tuesday!

19:58.857 --> 20:00.792
You staying long?

20:00.826 --> 20:05.831
No.

20:25.450 --> 20:27.218
Hello?

20:27.251 --> 20:27.819
Hi.

20:27.853 --> 20:32.858
It's... it's Karen.

20:37.529 --> 20:38.897
Hey.

20:38.930 --> 20:43.935
Hey.

20:52.010 --> 20:55.781
This place is
different than I expected.

20:55.814 --> 20:59.283
What did you expect?

20:59.316 --> 21:01.285
I don't know.

21:01.318 --> 21:03.655
You want something to drink?

21:03.689 --> 21:06.792
I'd rather smoke.

21:06.825 --> 21:10.529
I keep
forgetting it's legal here.

21:10.562 --> 21:14.733
You still have to be 21.

21:14.766 --> 21:18.269
How old are you?

21:18.302 --> 21:21.473
19.

21:21.506 --> 21:24.676
You can get in trouble.

21:24.710 --> 21:28.447
I've done way worse.

21:28.480 --> 21:33.417
You want some?

21:33.452 --> 21:38.457
No, thanks.

21:41.392 --> 21:43.895
They were my
favorite pair of jeans.

21:43.929 --> 21:48.934
I always cut them and
make them too short.

21:53.672 --> 21:56.307
What are these?

21:56.340 --> 21:58.043
Look like I could've made 'em.

21:58.076 --> 22:01.980
But you didn't.

22:02.013 --> 22:03.782
So?

22:03.815 --> 22:08.587
So I could sell
them for a lot of money.

22:08.620 --> 22:12.591
It's more about the
process than the result.

22:12.624 --> 22:17.629
Like the emotion of the process.

22:18.930 --> 22:23.935
I get that.

22:29.373 --> 22:31.877
I like this one better, though.

22:31.910 --> 22:32.944
Oh.

22:32.978 --> 22:37.983
That's nothing.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.685
I wish I had a talent.

22:40.719 --> 22:43.420
I'm sure you do.

22:43.455 --> 22:48.325
Why?

22:48.359 --> 22:49.761
I don't know.

22:49.795 --> 22:54.800
People in this town
don't have talents.

23:00.806 --> 23:02.974
Can we play this?

23:03.008 --> 23:07.913
Yeah.

23:07.946 --> 23:11.550
You don't know how to?

23:11.583 --> 23:15.654
It's okay, it just
means you're young.

23:15.687 --> 23:17.354
I wish I was old.

23:17.388 --> 23:19.024
Why?

23:19.057 --> 23:22.393
So I could do whatever I want.

23:22.427 --> 23:24.395
You're only old when you know
what you want and that you'll

23:24.429 --> 23:27.666
never get it.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.568
That's sad.

23:29.601 --> 23:31.603
Yeah.

23:31.636 --> 23:34.606
I love this record, I
can't believe it's here.

23:34.639 --> 23:36.942
Aren't they all yours?

23:36.975 --> 23:39.144
Yeah, I just...

23:39.177 --> 23:43.148
I forgot.

23:43.181 --> 23:44.783
It's sort of popular.

23:44.816 --> 23:46.417
Or was.

23:46.451 --> 23:51.456
I... I don't know if
it's cool, really.

24:03.001 --> 24:06.504
I remember the first
time I heard this song.

24:06.538 --> 24:08.940
I was a freshman in college.

24:08.974 --> 24:12.544
I was at this guy's apartment,
and he had a roommate that was

24:12.577 --> 24:17.582
older who I had such a crush on.

24:18.617 --> 24:20.118
What happened?

24:20.151 --> 24:25.090
Everyone had sort of left the
room before he put this one on.

24:25.123 --> 24:28.059
We were sitting next to
each other on the couch...

24:28.093 --> 24:30.662
just listening.

24:30.695 --> 24:33.732
I thought he was
going to kiss me.

24:33.765 --> 24:37.969
But instead, he walked over
to the corner of the room...

24:38.003 --> 24:43.008
and then he put his arms
around himself like this,

24:43.375 --> 24:45.844
and he kind of just...

24:45.877 --> 24:50.615
danced the entire song
with his back to me.

24:50.649 --> 24:55.020
I don't think he even
knew I was watching.

24:55.053 --> 25:00.058
It's like I wasn't even there.

25:02.093 --> 25:07.098
It's funny how things matter
so much when you're young.

25:09.167 --> 25:11.569
I like it.

25:11.603 --> 25:14.105
What?

25:14.139 --> 25:18.643
The song.

25:18.677 --> 25:20.946
It's good, right?

25:20.979 --> 25:25.984
Tell me if it looks
as cool when I do it.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.912
Do you think I'd be any good...

25:53.945 --> 25:56.014
as an actor?

25:56.047 --> 25:58.016
I... I don't know.

25:58.049 --> 26:01.619
I've never seen you act.

26:09.995 --> 26:15.000
Aren't you gonna answer it?

26:15.734 --> 26:18.136
I'm not really
supposed to be here.

26:18.169 --> 26:19.537
Who is it?

26:19.571 --> 26:20.238
My ex.

26:25.944 --> 26:31.149
Don't call here again,
you cheating piece of shit.

26:33.985 --> 26:37.288
How'd you know?

26:37.322 --> 26:42.527
Men are scum.

26:50.835 --> 26:51.736
Did you see one?

26:51.770 --> 26:55.240
Yeah.

26:55.273 --> 26:57.108
How'd you do that?

26:57.142 --> 26:59.611
So you put your mouth
in a circle kind of,

26:59.644 --> 27:01.579
and just like blow
out with your...

27:01.613 --> 27:06.618
tongue, I guess?

27:31.242 --> 27:36.247
When are you going back to LA?

27:39.784 --> 27:40.952
I don't know.

27:40.985 --> 27:43.188
I don't have a...

27:43.221 --> 27:46.758
specific date.

27:46.791 --> 27:51.796
When I feel like it.

27:55.967 --> 27:58.670
Wanna see something cool?

27:58.703 --> 27:59.637
Sure.

27:59.671 --> 28:00.839
Okay.

28:00.872 --> 28:05.877
Just hit it.

28:22.026 --> 28:23.661
Should we put it out?

28:23.695 --> 28:27.132
Yeah.

28:28.733 --> 28:33.738
You wanna take it?

28:34.772 --> 28:36.007
Souvenir.

28:37.476 --> 28:42.680
That's a good souvenir.

28:50.088 --> 28:51.823
No one's me.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.024
I know, just don't talk.

29:01.299 --> 29:04.769
Am I blinking?

29:08.940 --> 29:10.008
One more time.

29:10.041 --> 29:14.879
Okay.

29:14.913 --> 29:19.717
One, two, three.

30:12.504 --> 30:14.872
Morning.

30:14.906 --> 30:16.542
What's this?

30:16.575 --> 30:20.245
Breakfast.

30:20.278 --> 30:22.213
Where'd you get these?

30:22.247 --> 30:27.252
I'll show you.

31:32.451 --> 31:36.854
Once, when I was little,
I peeled a clementine...

31:36.888 --> 31:40.291
and I held it up on my finger...

31:40.325 --> 31:42.126
just like this.

31:42.160 --> 31:46.465
And a little bird swooped down
and grabbed it off my finger.

31:46.498 --> 31:51.503
It was a like a little oriole
or a sparrow or something.

31:51.704 --> 31:53.404
It wasn't any bigger
than the clementine,

31:53.439 --> 31:58.444
and yet he managed to just
pick it up and fly away.

31:58.577 --> 32:03.582
It was the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

32:03.716 --> 32:06.117
It got ruined, though.

32:06.150 --> 32:08.920
Why was it ruined?

32:08.953 --> 32:13.958
No one believed me.

32:26.971 --> 32:29.941
Where's your place?

32:29.974 --> 32:33.010
Just across the lake.

32:33.044 --> 32:34.613
Where?

32:34.646 --> 32:36.648
You wouldn't like it.

32:36.682 --> 32:40.619
Why not?

32:40.652 --> 32:43.955
I'm not really
supposed to be here either.

32:43.988 --> 32:46.357
There's this guy...

32:46.391 --> 32:49.193
Tommy, he's older.

32:49.227 --> 32:52.230
He's gonna take me to LA.

32:52.263 --> 32:54.533
When?

32:54.566 --> 32:57.402
Soon.

32:57.436 --> 32:59.971
You should be careful.

33:00.004 --> 33:01.640
Why?

33:01.673 --> 33:03.475
There are people out there
that'll take advantage of you if

33:03.509 --> 33:06.110
you let them.

33:06.144 --> 33:09.448
Why would I let them?

33:09.481 --> 33:14.486
Never mind.

33:18.524 --> 33:23.327
You're cool.

33:23.361 --> 33:28.366
You are.

34:33.130 --> 34:38.135
Shit.

34:43.139 --> 34:48.145
Hello?

34:51.650 --> 34:55.654
Anybody home?

34:55.687 --> 35:00.692
Just a minute!

35:05.697 --> 35:06.297
Hey.

35:06.330 --> 35:07.064
Hi.

35:07.098 --> 35:08.165
I'm Beau.

35:08.199 --> 35:10.435
I do repairs,
check on the house.

35:10.469 --> 35:15.474
I think I noticed
your car a few days ago.

35:17.876 --> 35:21.412
So, um...

35:21.446 --> 35:23.080
what happened to the window?

35:23.114 --> 35:24.550
I don't know.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.684
Was there a storm?

35:25.717 --> 35:29.353
No, nothing too bad.

35:29.387 --> 35:32.256
You okay?

35:32.290 --> 35:36.495
Yeah, it's nothing.

35:36.528 --> 35:37.796
You should be careful.

35:37.829 --> 35:38.997
It's not very safe.

35:39.031 --> 35:41.165
That garbage bag won't keep
out an animal that wants in.

35:41.198 --> 35:42.734
Plus...

35:42.768 --> 35:47.773
that guy right there looks like
it could come down any day now.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.509
I mean, I got some
limbs off the roof but,

35:50.542 --> 35:52.678
uh, could be more.

35:52.711 --> 35:54.245
Especially if we do
get one of those storms,

35:54.278 --> 35:55.480
you know?

35:55.514 --> 35:59.150
It looks fine to me.

35:59.183 --> 36:01.218
Huh.

36:01.252 --> 36:06.257
Well, you're the expert.

37:20.766 --> 37:22.901
Did you see that?

37:22.934 --> 37:24.603
Very good.

37:24.636 --> 37:26.872
Will you come swim with me?

37:26.905 --> 37:28.607
I just want to
sit here for a minute.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.709
Come on!

37:30.742 --> 37:35.747
Maybe in a little bit.

37:44.623 --> 37:48.894
Who's that?

37:48.927 --> 37:50.495
Just this guy.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.698
He's doing some
work on the house.

37:52.731 --> 37:55.867
Mind if I use the bathroom?

37:55.901 --> 38:00.906
No.

39:05.637 --> 39:09.441
Shh.

39:09.474 --> 39:14.012
Watch this.

39:14.045 --> 39:18.049
Woo!

39:18.083 --> 39:19.551
Woo.

39:20.652 --> 39:22.386
I told Beau he
could swim with us.

39:22.419 --> 39:24.355
I thought you said
this was a pool party.

39:24.388 --> 39:25.090
I didn't say that.

39:25.123 --> 39:26.323
Yeah, you did.

39:27.826 --> 39:31.496
Cleared all the
branches for you.

39:31.530 --> 39:34.866
Great.

39:34.900 --> 39:39.905
Woo!

39:40.105 --> 39:41.573
Where'd he go?

39:41.606 --> 39:43.041
Gah!

39:44.543 --> 39:47.712
Beau, stop it!

39:47.746 --> 39:49.346
You're not gonna swim?

39:49.380 --> 39:50.615
Come on!

39:50.649 --> 39:52.117
Yeah, come on!

39:52.150 --> 39:53.051
Beau, stop.

39:53.084 --> 39:55.053
Did you see
that fish down there?

39:55.086 --> 39:55.687
What?

39:55.720 --> 39:56.320
Look.

39:56.353 --> 39:57.421
You guys have fun.

39:57.455 --> 39:58.523
Wait!

39:58.557 --> 39:59.658
Here.

39:59.691 --> 40:01.392
Hold onto me.

40:03.628 --> 40:04.930
We live in the most
beautiful place in the world,

40:04.963 --> 40:06.031
don't we?

40:06.064 --> 40:07.666
I think it's boring.

40:07.699 --> 40:12.403
You're boring.

40:12.437 --> 40:13.872
Beau.

40:13.905 --> 40:14.405
Yeah?

40:14.439 --> 40:17.909
What if Karen sees?

40:17.943 --> 40:22.948
Sees what?

40:23.315 --> 40:24.749
She's a dyke.

40:24.783 --> 40:27.485
And not your mom.

40:27.519 --> 40:30.856
How do you know?

40:30.889 --> 40:35.894
I know.

40:53.211 --> 40:56.481
I could
call the police, you know.

40:56.514 --> 41:00.986
I'm not
leaving without Ramsey.

41:01.019 --> 41:05.891
Stay as long as you want.

41:05.924 --> 41:08.793
You don't
get to invite me now.

41:08.827 --> 41:11.062
I broke in.

41:11.096 --> 41:14.132
I like knowing
exactly where you are.

41:14.165 --> 41:19.170
And what you're doing.

41:19.271 --> 41:24.476
You don't know everything.

41:27.012 --> 41:28.780
D.

41:58.076 --> 42:00.512
Come here.

42:00.545 --> 42:01.980
What?

42:02.013 --> 42:03.982
I wanna
show you something.

42:36.881 --> 42:41.886
Shh.

42:46.324 --> 42:47.759
What are you doing?

42:47.792 --> 42:52.797
It was
right over there.

42:55.934 --> 42:58.837
Pow.

42:58.870 --> 43:01.039
Why'd you do that?

43:01.072 --> 43:05.910
Just for sport.

43:05.944 --> 43:07.545
Come on.

43:07.579 --> 43:09.047
Where are you going?

43:40.645 --> 43:45.650
Lana?

43:50.188 --> 43:55.193
Lana?

44:00.632 --> 44:03.101
Hey!

44:03.134 --> 44:03.868
Come on.

44:03.902 --> 44:04.736
What?

44:04.769 --> 44:05.336
He's coming.

44:05.370 --> 44:06.237
Hey, stop.

44:06.271 --> 44:08.106
You're hurting me!

44:08.139 --> 44:09.607
Don't do anything stupid.

44:09.641 --> 44:11.242
What's wrong with you?

44:11.276 --> 44:16.047
Hey.

44:16.081 --> 44:18.683
You okay?

44:18.716 --> 44:23.721
Yeah.

44:24.789 --> 44:29.794
You good?

44:50.115 --> 44:52.250
Cold?

44:52.283 --> 44:53.818
Maybe.

44:53.852 --> 44:58.156
Here.

44:58.189 --> 44:59.023
Thank you.

44:59.057 --> 45:01.359
You're welcome.

45:01.392 --> 45:03.361
Are those for s'mores?

45:03.394 --> 45:04.062
Yeah.

45:04.762 --> 45:06.231
I'm like a boy scout.

45:06.264 --> 45:07.232
You're awesome.

45:07.265 --> 45:07.966
I know.

45:07.999 --> 45:10.702
I can't help it.

45:10.735 --> 45:13.271
Oh my gosh, Karen.

45:15.106 --> 45:16.708
I'm gonna get sticks.

45:16.741 --> 45:21.746
Okay.

45:37.829 --> 45:40.398
What are you doing?

45:40.432 --> 45:45.003
Like, what is this?

45:45.036 --> 45:47.272
She's not gonna...

45:47.305 --> 45:52.310
come up here after you,
if... if that's what you think.

45:52.710 --> 45:55.213
So you're supposed
to be watching me?

45:55.246 --> 45:57.048
Is that the deal?

45:57.081 --> 45:59.485
She's just worried about you.

45:59.518 --> 46:00.318
Okay?

46:00.351 --> 46:01.219
That's all.

46:01.252 --> 46:03.021
What does
she think I'm gonna do?

46:03.054 --> 46:06.824
I don't know.

46:06.858 --> 46:09.327
I don't know.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.094
I mean...

46:10.128 --> 46:12.096
This was just a cut.

46:12.130 --> 46:16.768
It was an accident.

46:16.801 --> 46:18.102
What did you say?

46:18.136 --> 46:19.737
What did you tell her?

46:19.771 --> 46:20.305
Nothing.

46:20.338 --> 46:22.006
What did you tell her?

46:22.040 --> 46:26.978
Nothing.

46:27.011 --> 46:32.016
She did this.

46:38.890 --> 46:40.291
Karen?

46:48.099 --> 46:49.167
At
the end of your message,

46:49.200 --> 46:50.301
press one.

46:52.103 --> 46:55.807
I'd burn this whole fucking
house down before I kill myself

46:55.840 --> 47:00.845
over you.

47:47.091 --> 47:52.096
Hey.

47:53.197 --> 47:55.400
All right.

47:55.434 --> 47:56.468
Where you headed?

47:56.502 --> 48:00.071
I have plans.

48:00.104 --> 48:04.510
Cool.

48:17.055 --> 48:20.958
Oof.

48:20.992 --> 48:22.160
Can I get
you another one?

48:22.193 --> 48:23.562
Um...

48:23.595 --> 48:25.196
Y... uh, yeah.

48:25.229 --> 48:30.234
Yeah.

49:17.516 --> 49:18.617
Thank you.

49:29.595 --> 49:31.430
Hello?

49:31.463 --> 49:33.532
You answered.

49:33.565 --> 49:35.434
Lana?

49:35.467 --> 49:38.537
Yeah.

49:38.570 --> 49:41.707
Are you okay?

49:41.740 --> 49:46.944
Do you think you
could come pick me up?

50:13.337 --> 50:18.342
Can we just go?

50:27.653 --> 50:32.658
Wanna get ice cream?

50:36.194 --> 50:37.061
Was that a yes?

50:37.094 --> 50:40.031
I didn't hear you.

50:40.064 --> 50:45.069
Yeah.

50:58.517 --> 51:03.522
So, how old are you, really?

51:07.124 --> 51:09.327
I'm sorry, it's just...

51:09.360 --> 51:10.429
sometimes, you seem...

51:10.462 --> 51:13.331
Like a liar?

51:13.364 --> 51:17.301
No.

51:17.335 --> 51:20.739
I'm not a famous artist.

51:20.772 --> 51:25.176
I know.

51:25.209 --> 51:30.214
You're still an artist, though.

51:36.655 --> 51:41.660
Tell me about your ex.

51:43.495 --> 51:46.431
When we first met...

51:46.465 --> 51:48.834
I went by her studio...

51:48.867 --> 51:52.103
and she asked me what I thought
about this painting that she was

51:52.136 --> 51:55.440
working on.

51:55.474 --> 52:00.479
I told her I didn't like
it, even though I did.

52:00.646 --> 52:03.715
Why?

52:03.749 --> 52:06.518
I don't know.

52:06.552 --> 52:07.853
And she tore it up.

52:07.886 --> 52:13.090
Completely destroyed it
right in front of me.

52:13.692 --> 52:17.361
Why'd she do that?

52:17.395 --> 52:22.400
I think she wanted
me to feel special.

52:24.836 --> 52:28.306
Did it work?

52:28.339 --> 52:31.877
Yeah.

52:31.910 --> 52:35.313
That's nice.

52:35.346 --> 52:40.351
It wasn't nice.

52:46.792 --> 52:49.561
Would he hurt you?

52:49.595 --> 52:53.865
Tommy?

52:53.899 --> 52:58.904
I don't think he cares
if I'm dead or alive.

52:58.937 --> 53:04.141
Please don't take me home.

53:30.569 --> 53:32.671
Can I braid your hair?

53:32.704 --> 53:34.439
What?

53:34.473 --> 53:39.478
Why?

53:43.982 --> 53:48.687
Okay.

54:29.326 --> 54:34.331
All done.

54:34.499 --> 54:39.504
Go look.

54:49.614 --> 54:51.850
Do you like it?

54:51.883 --> 54:54.453
Yeah.

54:54.486 --> 54:58.623
How'd you get so
good at eyeliner?

54:58.657 --> 55:01.626
Practice, I guess.

55:01.660 --> 55:03.695
Will you teach me?

55:03.729 --> 55:05.630
Tomorrow.

55:05.664 --> 55:10.669
Okay.

56:13.498 --> 56:16.535
I'm scared.

56:16.568 --> 56:18.937
Are you?

56:18.970 --> 56:21.006
No.

56:21.039 --> 56:26.044
Does anyone know
that you're here?

56:26.945 --> 56:32.349
Then there's nothing
to be scared about.

56:32.818 --> 56:37.622
Can I sleep in here?

56:37.656 --> 56:42.661
Yeah.

56:53.505 --> 56:55.874
Are you going to sleep?

56:55.907 --> 56:58.043
Yeah.

56:58.076 --> 56:59.811
Okay.

56:59.845 --> 57:00.946
Me too.

57:00.979 --> 57:05.984
All right.

01:00:06.865 --> 01:00:08.666
What are you doing here?

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.238
Stayed over.

01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:16.708
You should be careful.

01:00:16.741 --> 01:00:19.177
She's not who you think she is.

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:22.680
And what makes you
think I'm so innocent?

01:00:22.714 --> 01:00:25.150
Oh, so you're a dyke now too.

01:00:25.183 --> 01:00:26.351
Maybe I am.

01:00:26.384 --> 01:00:30.021
Yeah, right.

01:00:30.055 --> 01:00:35.060
You're an idiot.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.061
It was supposed
to be a compliment,

01:00:36.094 --> 01:00:41.099
you know that?

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:46.838
I'm just saying, a lot
of guys think you're hot.

01:00:46.871 --> 01:00:50.075
I mean...

01:00:50.108 --> 01:00:53.311
I do.

01:00:53.344 --> 01:00:56.648
You said that like
you thought of it.

01:00:56.681 --> 01:01:01.686
Everybody's thought of that.

01:01:58.877 --> 01:02:02.448
I just wanted to try it on.

01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:05.717
Do you mind?

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:10.755
Come here.

01:02:24.769 --> 01:02:29.774
Close your eyes.

01:02:53.131 --> 01:02:57.235
You're so young.

01:02:57.268 --> 01:03:01.105
Do you like it?

01:03:01.139 --> 01:03:06.144
Yeah.

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:21.359
Don't you like me?

01:03:21.392 --> 01:03:23.761
That doesn't matter.

01:03:23.795 --> 01:03:27.899
Yes, it does.

01:03:27.932 --> 01:03:31.503
I'm old.

01:03:31.537 --> 01:03:36.741
Not yet.

01:03:39.445 --> 01:03:44.450
Please.

01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:04.102
Take this off.

01:04:41.473 --> 01:04:46.478
Don't look at me.

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:34.192
Hey.

01:05:34.225 --> 01:05:39.230
Sorry.

01:05:58.584 --> 01:06:00.619
It's okay.

01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:04.155
It's not you.

01:06:04.188 --> 01:06:07.091
Tommy said that
he had a friend...

01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:10.962
who knew this producer in LA...

01:06:10.995 --> 01:06:15.366
and that if he liked me,
he'd introduce me to him.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.269
So last night we
went to the house...

01:06:18.302 --> 01:06:21.038
the guy with the
friend or whatever.

01:06:21.072 --> 01:06:26.077
Where I picked you up?

01:06:27.513 --> 01:06:31.450
It was a pretty
normal-looking place except...

01:06:31.483 --> 01:06:36.488
there was this camera
where a couch would be.

01:06:36.822 --> 01:06:38.990
I hadn't really thought I'd...

01:06:39.023 --> 01:06:44.028
have to be filmed or anything,
but that's pretty normal, right?

01:06:44.395 --> 01:06:46.598
I've never...

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:50.469
been to an
audition, not a real one.

01:06:50.502 --> 01:06:55.507
But the guy looked at me and
said that I looked too young.

01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:01.145
That nobody would touch
me unless I looked 18.

01:07:01.747 --> 01:07:04.348
And I said that I
could change and...

01:07:04.382 --> 01:07:07.653
put some makeup on but...

01:07:07.686 --> 01:07:11.422
he said that less was more.

01:07:11.457 --> 01:07:14.660
Or something like that.

01:07:14.693 --> 01:07:16.194
That I should just
take off my shirt,

01:07:16.227 --> 01:07:21.232
that it was babyish.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.136
And Tommy just sat there
and he didn't say anything,

01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:30.174
so...

01:07:30.341 --> 01:07:35.346
I don't know, I just did it.

01:07:37.816 --> 01:07:42.019
I told them that I... I
didn't want to be a model.

01:07:42.053 --> 01:07:46.190
That I wanted to be an actress.

01:07:46.224 --> 01:07:50.027
But he said it was all
the same in LA, that...

01:07:50.061 --> 01:07:53.264
his friend would have to see way
more than a girl in a bra if I

01:07:53.297 --> 01:07:57.503
expected to be
seen for anything.

01:07:57.536 --> 01:08:02.039
That the girls in LA were crazy.

01:08:02.073 --> 01:08:06.645
That they'd do anything
for a chance to be seen.

01:08:06.678 --> 01:08:10.047
Do you think that's true?

01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:13.785
I don't know.

01:08:13.819 --> 01:08:15.253
He said
it didn't matter, though,

01:08:15.286 --> 01:08:19.758
because he could
tell that I didn't want it.

01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:23.795
That I'd never make it.

01:08:23.828 --> 01:08:27.231
And then I got
kind of mad then...

01:08:27.265 --> 01:08:32.069
so I did it.

01:08:32.103 --> 01:08:36.675
I stood there and I
took off all my clothes.

01:08:36.707 --> 01:08:41.712
And I stared at the
camera for a really long time.

01:08:42.014 --> 01:08:44.783
And there was this...

01:08:44.816 --> 01:08:48.787
white sheet, like a
backdrop, and then some lights,

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:53.825
and after a while, I couldn't
really see him or Tommy anymore.

01:08:55.359 --> 01:09:00.163
It was just me.

01:09:00.197 --> 01:09:04.670
And then he told
me to turn around.

01:09:04.703 --> 01:09:09.707
His friend would need to
see something like that.

01:09:11.274 --> 01:09:13.879
That's when I could tell that...

01:09:13.912 --> 01:09:16.247
the sheet wasn't white, it was
kind of grey with some yellow

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:20.151
stains on it.

01:09:20.184 --> 01:09:25.189
And I realized this guy
didn't know anybody in LA.

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:28.225
And I was gonna
turn around and tell him that

01:09:28.259 --> 01:09:32.196
but...

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:37.234
I didn't.

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:42.573
I liked being told what to do...

01:09:43.942 --> 01:09:49.145
and knowing that they
had to be looking at me.

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:57.355
I hadn't really realized
how dry my mouth was...

01:09:57.623 --> 01:10:02.628
or that he had taken it out.

01:10:02.728 --> 01:10:04.830
It was like...

01:10:04.863 --> 01:10:08.332
you could hear it
before you could see it.

01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:15.272
And then he was just
standing there jerking off...

01:10:15.306 --> 01:10:17.643
while Tommy was
laughing, and then...

01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:21.345
then told me to
turn around and...

01:10:21.379 --> 01:10:25.717
so I did.

01:10:27.653 --> 01:10:28.720
I'm so stupid.

01:10:28.754 --> 01:10:29.588
No, you're not.

01:10:29.621 --> 01:10:30.489
Yes.

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:32.824
No, you're not.

01:10:32.858 --> 01:10:34.726
It's okay.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.460
You're here now.

01:10:35.494 --> 01:10:36.962
You're with me.

01:10:36.995 --> 01:10:41.900
Come here.

01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:45.504
It's okay.

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:49.775
I just
want it to disappear.

01:13:45.483 --> 01:13:50.488
Yo.

01:14:35.867 --> 01:14:40.538
What the fuck?

01:14:40.572 --> 01:14:41.072
Yo, what is it?

01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:44.442
Who are you?

01:14:44.476 --> 01:14:46.678
Give me the camera.

01:14:46.711 --> 01:14:47.879
What?

01:14:47.913 --> 01:14:49.180
Give me the camera.

01:14:49.214 --> 01:14:50.615
Take it off the tripod.

01:14:50.649 --> 01:14:51.750
Yeah, have it.

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:56.788
It's not even worth that much.

01:14:57.022 --> 01:14:58.089
Get the fucking camera!

01:14:58.123 --> 01:14:58.957
I'm going!

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:03.995
Put it on the couch.

01:15:04.963 --> 01:15:06.031
Get in the room.

01:15:06.064 --> 01:15:06.564
What?

01:15:06.598 --> 01:15:09.567
Get in here!

01:15:09.601 --> 01:15:12.871
Jesus.

01:15:12.904 --> 01:15:16.508
Get in the closet.

01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:20.779
Close the door!

01:15:20.812 --> 01:15:23.481
Did you think you
would get away with it?

01:15:23.515 --> 01:15:28.520
Did you?!

01:15:37.696 --> 01:15:38.663
Who... who
the fuck is she?

01:15:38.697 --> 01:15:43.868
What do you mean
"who the fuck is she?"

01:17:07.085 --> 01:17:08.286
Okay, okay, go.

01:17:08.319 --> 01:17:13.224
Go.

01:17:13.258 --> 01:17:15.894
Oh, come here, boy.

01:17:37.148 --> 01:17:41.820
Did you tell her
all this was yours?

01:17:41.853 --> 01:17:45.056
Did she listen to
your stories and...

01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:50.095
make you feel big and important?

01:17:50.595 --> 01:17:55.800
You mean like me?

01:17:57.335 --> 01:18:02.340
Yeah.

01:18:02.475 --> 01:18:06.678
Why are you here?

01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:10.782
This is my house.

01:18:10.815 --> 01:18:13.384
You can't fuck with me anymore.

01:18:13.418 --> 01:18:16.087
I'm here.

01:18:16.121 --> 01:18:19.824
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:18:19.858 --> 01:18:21.126
Where is she?

01:18:21.159 --> 01:18:23.995
Who?

01:18:24.028 --> 01:18:26.664
Lana.

01:18:26.698 --> 01:18:28.800
The little girl?

01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:31.903
I took her home.

01:18:31.936 --> 01:18:33.204
You shouldn't have done that.

01:18:33.238 --> 01:18:38.243
She's bored and she's a liar.

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:42.413
It's not worth it.

01:18:42.448 --> 01:18:46.784
I'm so sick of your lessons.

01:18:46.818 --> 01:18:49.687
I'm not like you.

01:18:49.721 --> 01:18:52.223
And what am I like?

01:18:52.257 --> 01:18:57.262
Old.

01:21:11.963 --> 01:21:13.264
Come here, boy.

01:21:13.298 --> 01:21:14.600
Come here, boy!

01:21:14.633 --> 01:21:17.168
Come here!

01:21:17.201 --> 01:21:18.069
Where's Lana, boy?

01:21:19.505 --> 01:21:20.338
Come on!

01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:22.373
Okay, fine!

01:21:36.988 --> 01:21:41.993
One, two, three four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:21:45.464 --> 01:21:50.034
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

01:21:50.068 --> 01:21:53.371
and one, two, three,
four, and five...

01:21:53.404 --> 01:21:54.972
and seven, eight.

01:21:55.006 --> 01:22:00.011
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:22:02.146 --> 01:22:03.915
Julie?

01:22:03.948 --> 01:22:04.450
All right, one sec...

01:22:04.483 --> 01:22:05.350
Julie!

01:22:05.383 --> 01:22:07.352
Mom!

01:22:07.385 --> 01:22:08.386
You said
you would help me...

01:22:08.419 --> 01:22:09.655
Okay, I will!

01:22:09.688 --> 01:22:11.122
Mom, we're hangin' out!

01:22:11.155 --> 01:22:13.459
Now!

01:22:13.492 --> 01:22:18.497
Okay, fine.

01:22:20.532 --> 01:22:24.402
Excuse me.

01:22:24.436 --> 01:22:29.441
Julie, who was that?

01:22:34.979 --> 01:22:38.015
Hi, I'm Julia Lawson, I'm
16 years old, and I'm from

01:22:38.049 --> 01:22:40.486
Florence, Oregon.

01:22:40.519 --> 01:22:42.286
Now what?

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.023
Show us something cool.

01:22:46.057 --> 01:22:48.259
I can make myself cry.

01:22:50.462 --> 01:22:55.299
Okay.

01:22:58.136 --> 01:23:03.141
What is she doing?

01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:16.187
What else would
you like me to do?

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.623
Take your top off.

01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:20.358
Shh.

01:23:20.391 --> 01:23:25.396
Shut up.

01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:34.506
Chill out, dude.

01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:40.746
I thought you wanted
me to hook you up.

01:23:40.779 --> 01:23:43.014
I do.

01:23:43.047 --> 01:23:48.052
Okay, turn around.

01:23:50.321 --> 01:23:51.055
Yeah!

01:24:28.527 --> 01:24:30.629
What are you doing?

01:24:30.662 --> 01:24:33.432
D left Ramsey here
for ya, if you want him.

01:24:33.465 --> 01:24:38.470
Said I could take him to
the shelter if you don't.

01:24:38.504 --> 01:24:40.037
Of course I want him.

01:24:49.146 --> 01:24:52.584
I changed the
locks on the doors.

01:24:52.618 --> 01:24:54.151
I know.

01:24:54.185 --> 01:24:57.756
New
window's open, though.

01:24:57.789 --> 01:25:02.794
Thank you.

01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:45.069
Such a good boy.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.845
Lana?

01:26:27.546 --> 01:26:32.751
It's Julia, actually.

01:26:34.285 --> 01:26:39.290
I know.

01:26:45.964 --> 01:26:49.568
I heard what you did.

01:26:49.601 --> 01:26:54.606
Where is it?

01:26:55.406 --> 01:26:59.745
In the lake.

01:26:59.778 --> 01:27:04.549
Thank you.

01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:09.588
Did you watch it?

01:27:09.788 --> 01:27:13.324
No.

01:27:13.357 --> 01:27:16.862
Good.

01:27:16.895 --> 01:27:21.900
Can I see you again?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.703
I don't think so.

01:27:24.736 --> 01:27:29.741
Why not?

01:27:29.841 --> 01:27:34.813
You're a good actor.

01:27:40.986 --> 01:27:46.190
Then why do I feel so sad?

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:51.630
You shouldn't have called here.

01:27:52.564 --> 01:27:57.569
Was any of it real for you?

01:27:57.936 --> 01:28:01.873
No.

01:28:01.907 --> 01:28:06.678
Then
you're a good actor too.

01:28:06.712 --> 01:28:09.748
I'm just old
enough to know better.

01:28:09.781 --> 01:28:10.649
Don't call here again.

01:28:10.682 --> 01:28:15.687
Karen?
