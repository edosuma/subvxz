WEBVTT

00:05.422 --> 00:08.539
Government sources tell us
the world's energy resources

00:08.634 --> 00:11.671
will be fully exhausted within five years.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.598
Space station
was completed today.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.939
Designed for a risky experimental mission.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.904
Onboard the orbiting lab
is the Shepard particle accelerator.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.901
If astronauts can get the Shepard working,

00:33.992 --> 00:35.698
it would produce free energy,

00:35.786 --> 00:37.697
solving the earth's energy crisis forever.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.629
As French officials announce
new energy-rationing provisions that...

00:48.715 --> 00:51.172
The dissolution of these
international alliances

00:51.260 --> 00:53.967
is setting the stage for armed conflict

00:54.054 --> 00:56.366
as the global energy crisis worsens.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.451
International effort is merely a drain

00:58.475 --> 01:00.466
of financial
and energy resources that can...

01:00.561 --> 01:02.247
- Yeah.
- And should be put to better use.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.271
I'll tell him.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.648
Okay.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.441
Thanks.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.649
Did you move at all?

01:10.112 --> 01:11.852
Forward or side to side?

01:11.947 --> 01:14.313
- Joe says you owe him a call.
- Did he ask you?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.524
I feel like honking the horn.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.346
Yeah, 'cause that's gonna
make us loads of new friends.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.156
Are you serious?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.737
Stop. Stop.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.410
Started a trend.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.880
Oh.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.336
Come on. That's like
the fourth blackout today.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.175
Fifth.

01:37.889 --> 01:38.924
Did he ask you?

01:41.226 --> 01:43.808
And? You know what I said.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.851
I'm not leaving you.
That mission could be years.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.579
You said you could be back in six months.

01:47.858 --> 01:48.858
Do you want me to go?

01:50.902 --> 01:52.262
Joe knows what we've been through.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.421
And yet, he still wants you on the crew.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.969
- There are other comm officers.
- Yeah, but he called you.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.028
Why are you pushing this?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.119
Why do you think?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.621
Forget about me and what I want,

02:05.542 --> 02:06.542
which is for you to stay.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.253
Why do you think?

02:15.927 --> 02:17.508
Because you're sweet.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.803
Because people are starving.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.513
Because our energy supplies
are running out.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.435
And this mission could unlock
an endless supply of power

02:34.529 --> 02:35.689
that could save us all.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
If you go...

02:40.786 --> 02:41.786
You and I...

02:42.621 --> 02:43.621
We'll survive.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.248
I'm afraid if you don't...

02:51.380 --> 02:52.380
No one will.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.410
Tad throttle control, 8636.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.501
Line secure.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.198
Accelerator system status?

03:35.298 --> 03:36.629
Holding for pre-ignition.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.876
Shepard team,
you are go for countdown.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.450
Play ball, got our
fingers crossed here at mission control.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.055
Let's make this first one count.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.996
- Status boosters?
- Go.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.331
- The gnc?
- Go.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.355
Power up.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.146
Commander, Shepard team
standing by for your go.

03:58.864 --> 03:59.864
On my count.

04:01.366 --> 04:06.030
Three... two... one... full Mark.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.013
Huntsville, this is commander kiel.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.233
Firing has failed.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.126
- Morning, beautiful.
- Oh, sorry.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.079
- I woke you.
- No. Look.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.551
I'm working.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.964
I've got a patient today

07:52.055 --> 07:55.422
with camptodactyly-arthropathy-
coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.976
What's that?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.818
I'll let you know
after I've done my homework.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.804
I'm getting sick
of only seeing you on a screen.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.725
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.122
It's the rest of the world
I'm worried about.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.069
I mean, you see the same news that I do.

08:13.868 --> 08:14.868
It's madness.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.153
Oil wars are spreading.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.288
Russia's threatening ground invasion now.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.284
Can you believe that? Ground invasion.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.514
Which will only waste
all their oil reserves.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.631
Anyway...

08:28.967 --> 08:31.333
Normal life is hanging by a thread.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.013
You?

08:36.307 --> 08:37.513
We're all on edge.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.974
And we only have enough fuel
for three more firings.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.767
- I remember.
- If this doesn't work...

08:46.317 --> 08:48.808
I can't even think about
what happens down there.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.400
I don't think any of us are feeling...

08:54.659 --> 08:55.659
Hopeful.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.407
I miss you more every day.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.291
Like I miss them.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.375
And maybe I'm an idiot...

09:07.172 --> 09:08.172
But I'm hopeful.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.311
And not just for the work
that you're doing.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.969
We can't go back in time
and know what we know now.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.059
But I was thinking...

09:21.478 --> 09:22.718
Maybe when you get back...

11:26.352 --> 11:29.389
- Welcome to American sunrise...
- Oh!

11:29.480 --> 11:31.641
As we open today...

11:31.733 --> 11:32.768
2-1.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.790
Tell mission control
we're effective because we are not wimps.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.840
Shit.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.674
Six hundred and ninety-four.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.306
Six hundred and ninety-four days
I've kept our O2,

12:14.400 --> 12:19.110
co2, n2, hydrogen, water vapor
and methane at optimal levels.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.022
You know how many pressure leaks
we've had?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.276
Not one.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.949
No microbe overgrowth, nothing.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.027
- You know why?
- This is a long speech, volkov.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.783
Because I disinfect the decks
every 72 hours.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.990
I disinfect the decks, actually.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.916
If you have a point, I'd make it now.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.709
There's one part of this station,

12:35.797 --> 12:37.503
one part that is not working.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.443
This is interesting.
Do you know what part that is?

12:39.467 --> 12:40.752
The Shepard accelerator.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.835
There are 8 billion people counting on us.
What are you saying?

12:44.222 --> 12:45.502
I don't have a problem with you.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.077
But your little German
boyfriend over here, I do.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.704
- Go back to your quarters.
- Don't treat me like you're my mother.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.122
- You're not.
- Okay, that's enough.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.352
Hey, chill out, volky.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.833
Two years on this station,

12:54.857 --> 12:56.563
and this man has delivered nothing.

12:56.651 --> 12:57.651
Volkov!

12:58.820 --> 13:01.186
You need to think very carefully
about what you're saying.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.944
We've both heard the reports.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.993
Germany is preparing for war.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.116
And every day that goes by,

13:11.624 --> 13:13.489
more and more Russians are starving.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.167
Maybe you're not in such hurry
to get the Shepard working?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.883
Easy! Easy!

13:31.978 --> 13:33.514
This stops now!

13:34.564 --> 13:36.520
If we can't keep
our shit together up here,

13:36.607 --> 13:38.487
how can we ever expect them
to do it down there?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.767
- Maybe they won't!
- Keep your mouth shut!

13:40.862 --> 13:42.398
We have a job to do.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.072
Another test aboard
the cloverfield space station.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.829
The 47th test
in just over two years is scheduled

13:56.919 --> 13:59.626
for 8:00 A.M. eastern standard time.
All eyes are on...

13:59.714 --> 14:01.817
This is huntsville,
we've got eyes and ears.

14:01.841 --> 14:02.921
Morning, huntsville.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.056
Copy that.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.131
- Schmidt, system status?
- Green across the board.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.718
Right this minute, they're
testing a particle accelerator up there,

14:15.813 --> 14:19.647
so we can learn how to make
unlimited energy down here.

14:19.734 --> 14:23.773
But those who have accepted
the cloverfield paradox is real

14:23.863 --> 14:25.319
know how dangerous that is...

14:25.406 --> 14:26.759
Shepard holding for pre-ignition.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.149
Commander, Shepard team
standing by for your go.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.608
Diagnostic mode off.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.364
X-deck modification complete.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.196
Stabilizer active.

14:35.917 --> 14:39.080
Qinhuangdao, confirm pre-ignition
sequencing authorization.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.661
You're a go for accelerator pre-ignition.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.880
Huntsville and qinhuangdao control,
we'll call you post blackout.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.279
- Copy.
- Stand by for protocol go.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.168
Why does the accelerator
worry you so much?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.096
Because that accelerator
is a thousand times more powerful

14:52.183 --> 14:53.673
than any ever built.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.635
Every time they test it,
they risk ripping open

14:56.729 --> 14:58.970
the membrane of space time,

14:59.065 --> 15:01.147
smashing together multiple dimensions,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.099
shattering reality.

15:03.194 --> 15:06.061
And not just on that station, everywhere.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.357
This experiment could unleash chaos,

15:10.451 --> 15:12.533
the likes of which we have never seen.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.412
Monsters, demons, beasts from the sea...

15:16.499 --> 15:20.037
To clarify, you believe their efforts
to solve the energy crisis

15:20.128 --> 15:21.743
might unleash demons?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.499
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.296
Volkov, we're ready
to take the Shepard online.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.874
- How's your station?
- Hold on.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.051
I'm calibrating our expensive compass.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.753
And not just here and now.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.841
In the past, in the future,
in other dimensions.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.217
You have no idea how much I would

15:38.312 --> 15:40.644
love to be wrong about this.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.331
- Monk, turn that shit off.
- If you want to know more,

15:43.359 --> 15:44.849
please, read my book...

15:46.654 --> 15:48.064
Gyro is calibrating.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.901
Our station is good.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.422
You should ask schmidt,
is his station good?

15:54.454 --> 15:57.537
- Jesus Christ.
- Please, Mr. monk,

15:57.623 --> 15:59.909
- hit us with your holy stick.
- Oh, come on.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.957
- Not now, that we really need...
- Schmidt.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.678
The farther we travel from home,
the clearer it becomes

16:13.764 --> 16:16.722
that there is a power
infinitely greater than us.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.304
Please show your mercy.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.852
And allow the Shepard to work this time.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.898
To provide the energy we need...

16:27.695 --> 16:30.653
To prevent our countries
from going to war.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.992
Please, god, be on our side.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.704
Amen.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.457
Amen.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.501
That was righteous.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.126
Back to work.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.336
Sunday school over yet?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.095
Schmidt, power up.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.232
Sequence running.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.229
Thirty to ignition.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.281
Commander?

17:17.578 --> 17:20.991
Three... two... one...

17:21.082 --> 17:22.082
Mark.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.424
Please,
don't break up on me, baby.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.194
Yes. Yes, yes!

17:56.242 --> 17:57.482
We have a successful collision.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.609
What's our output?

18:00.162 --> 18:02.073
We have positive energy flow.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.574
For the first time.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.952
Look at this, look at this.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.125
- Holy shit, you did it.
- It's working.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.796
- We are focused at 47 teravolts.
- Oh, man!

18:11.882 --> 18:13.247
Hamilton, viewscreen mode.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.552
- Yeah!
- Oh, man! Nice.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.593
Oh, yeah! Oh, that's pretty.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.268
Schmidt, tell me something.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.648
It says it hit 602...

18:45.041 --> 18:46.702
What the hell is happening?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.605
Extinguisher systems are down.

19:11.734 --> 19:12.814
Then we ventilate.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.611
I need 63m open, now!

19:20.701 --> 19:23.659
Oh, no. Something's wrong here, guys.
It's all scrambled.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.495
Qinhuangdao, do you copy?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.009
The O2 tanks are leaking.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.015
Our reserves are severely diminished.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.209
- Qinhuangdao, do you copy?
- The systems are scrambled.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.349
There's absolutely no guarantee

19:54.443 --> 19:56.775
any executable will function as expected.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.604
I'm rebooting the comms system.
I'm not picking up anything.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.482
Okay, what else?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.737
Life support at 74 percent.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.945
Main power is fried. This is backup.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.575
Temperature is all over the place

20:08.666 --> 20:11.203
and nothing gets better
until Mundy and I get our hands on it.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.853
We got the gear to fix all this?

20:12.920 --> 20:15.232
- Not by a long shot.
- Then request an ecl.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.109
- Get 'em to send some supplies.
- Just doesn't make any sense.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.777
The device was outputting
a massive amount of energy.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.195
Tam, please kill that alarm.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.988
But then there was
some kind of malfunction.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.407
Really schmidt? There was a malfunction?

20:23.431 --> 20:24.431
Kiel?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.100
It isn't there.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.031
The frequency for mission control?

20:31.856 --> 20:32.856
The earth.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.482
I can't find anything.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.611
We must have gotten turned around,
moved during firing.

20:40.698 --> 20:44.156
It's big, blue, full of angry people.
Keep looking, you'll find it.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.930
I've double checked
the radio target, but the target's gone.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.945
Guys, the systems are scrambled.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.279
Hamilton's right.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.615
It's... it's not here.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.163
We're not picking up any signals.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.495
The entire earth is not gone.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.126
Cycle the external cameras.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.251
All of them.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.741
We knew it was dangerous.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.740
That's why we had to go up in space
to fire this thing.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.072
No, come on. Bullshit.

21:49.725 --> 21:50.725
No.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.822
You did this.
I never trusted you.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.769
We all did this.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.437
The earth is gone!
The earth is gone!

22:59.461 --> 23:01.106
Are you sure
we've checked everything?

23:01.130 --> 23:03.066
Mundy, you've
asked that question six times.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.401
It's a good bloody
question, isn't it?

23:04.425 --> 23:05.289
This is your fault.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.486
Of course you're blaming me for this.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.863
Who else
made this happen? Who else?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.282
We've been working
on this for two years. You knew the risks.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.118
- Volkov's right. The earth is gone.
- You don't know this.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.704
- Somehow, we did it.
- Look out any goddamn window.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.205
Maybe we're missing something.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.165
We're missing the earth.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.770
This is our fault.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.731
All right,
here's what we're up against.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.617
The station's got problems
we don't have tools to fix.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.079
At this point, looking for home
is a luxury for us.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.952
First, we need to survive.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.079
We need to consider, evidence or not...

24:24.421 --> 24:27.504
That we might have ended
the lives of billions of people.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.048
We didn't destroy the earth.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.466
We just... lost it.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.003
Totally routine day. Copy that.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.260
Mundy, take schmidt and deal with the oz2.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.431
I'm a physicist.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.634
And now you work for Mundy.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.184
Oh, your lucky day.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.932
Tam, you and monk

24:43.023 --> 24:44.934
are gonna search and repair
all power leaks.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.516
Maybe we can get
this temperature under control.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.693
Hamilton, volkov, test all circuits.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.236
Then we can start looking for home.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.314
When the Shepard overloaded...

24:53.409 --> 24:56.196
Something went wrong
with the station's orientation system.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.430
We're gonna replace the circuits.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.785
No shit. If that's the problem,

24:58.872 --> 25:01.409
but, um, it might be the gyro.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.993
Then let's get that fancy compass fixed.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.006
- Volkov?
- Yes.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.794
I found the problem with the gyro.
â€œWhat? It's fried?

25:15.973 --> 25:18.464
- It's not here.
- What do you mean "it's not here"?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.018
I secured this when we fired the ship.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.413
This look okay?

26:50.651 --> 26:51.651
Tam.

26:55.989 --> 26:56.989
Tam?

26:59.493 --> 27:00.983
- You all right?
- Shh.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.299
What is that?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.211
It's coming from inside the wall.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.793
- In the wall?
- No, walls don't make noises like that.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.799
- We have to open it.
- Open it?

27:21.890 --> 27:23.801
- Volkov, get the tools.
- Volky!

27:23.892 --> 27:25.883
Okay, before you rip off that panel

27:25.978 --> 27:28.098
and damage god-knows-what,
can we at least discuss it?

27:29.690 --> 27:31.209
Mundy's right.
It could be dangerous.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.689
- We should open it.
- No, we're not!

27:32.776 --> 27:34.061
Who are you to decide?

27:34.153 --> 27:36.519
Stop! We're doing this.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.562
All right, good luck.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.285
Three, two, one...

28:08.520 --> 28:10.806
- We're here. We've got you.
- Hold on. Hold on.

28:10.898 --> 28:13.376
- We have to cut her free.
- We can't cut anything.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.128
Those lines going through her body
are power lines.

28:15.152 --> 28:15.982
She's dying!

28:16.069 --> 28:17.422
- Mundy, shut the power off.
- She's hurt, we can't leave her.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.982
- Hold on.
- She's dying.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.952
We don't have a choice,
we've gotta cut her out.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.733
We have a choice! Stop it!
We don't know what that is.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.222
- Shut it off!
- We can reroute the power later.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.326
Hold on.

28:27.956 --> 28:31.164
- Munay!
- Module 17 powered down.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.854
- Just breathe. It's gonna be okay.
- Power's down.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.459
All right, let's cut her out.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.815
Monk! She's bleeding out.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.125
I can't do anything
until she's out of the wall.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.381
- Help me.
- Guys, hurry!

28:41.220 --> 28:44.132
Help me... Hamilton.

28:45.682 --> 28:46.922
Hamilton.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.632
She just said your name.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.342
What is happening to me?

28:52.439 --> 28:55.852
What's happening to me? What's happening?

28:55.943 --> 28:57.228
We're gonna cut you free.

28:57.319 --> 28:58.855
- Quick.
- Please.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.546
Come on, guys. Let's get her out.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.175
Can you hold her leg
out of the way?

29:02.199 --> 29:04.406
- Okay, got it.
- Hurry up!

29:04.493 --> 29:06.413
Mundy, the saw. Quick!

29:07.329 --> 29:08.739
Hold on. Stay with me.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.395
- Careful with the pipe.
- That's no good.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.161
- Pull her down. All right.
- Careful.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.608
- It's gonna be okay.
- Grab her leg.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.293
This is a mistake.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.078
Schmidt, I need more light.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.173
You got her? Keep her down.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.368
- Breathe, breathe.
- Okay, okay, okay.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.302
Get something to strap her down.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.354
- Keep her still.
- All right, all right.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.441
Okay.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.777
No official public
statement has been made

30:44.801 --> 30:46.587
about what caused the explosion

30:46.678 --> 30:49.636
that was thought at first
to be a nuclear weapon.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.554
But we are being assured by authorities

30:51.641 --> 30:53.381
that is not what this is.

30:56.438 --> 30:57.438
Are you on call?

30:58.065 --> 30:59.065
Good.

30:59.733 --> 31:00.733
Yeah, I saw it.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.211
Has the hospital issued code orange yet?

31:07.657 --> 31:08.817
Shaw said what did it?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.614
Jesus Christ.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.342
- This is madness!
- Calm down.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.747
We can't stay calm.
Not with that woman lying there.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.819
Who is she?
And what the hell is she doing here?

31:26.843 --> 31:29.585
- She knew my name.
- We're all going mad.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.783
I'm not gonna say it again.
We have to stay focused.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.513
We have other problems to deal with.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.215
Speaking of other problems,

31:35.310 --> 31:37.392
how the hell are we supposed
to find the earth?

31:37.479 --> 31:39.686
Without the gyro, we're lost.

31:39.773 --> 31:40.773
Any ideas?

31:42.109 --> 31:43.599
Because honestly, I'm stumped.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.977
Youre assuming earth is still there.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.524
Earth disappears.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.606
Station does not feel the same.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.066
A woman appears in the wall.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.026
We're definitely not in Kentucky anymore.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.492
- Kansas.
- Kansas?

31:57.582 --> 31:59.994
Really? Who gives a shit?

32:00.794 --> 32:02.000
People from Kansas.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.715
I don't know what's going on,
but one thing is clear.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.842
The Shepard's done it,

32:10.929 --> 32:13.011
which means it might also undo it.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.680
Right now, the integrity of the station
is all that matters.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.224
We have repairs that need to happen,
immediately.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.111
Monk will give us an update
when there is one.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.522
Let's get to it.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.573
Meet me at x-deck in ten minutes

32:41.376 --> 32:43.583
kiel wants me with him...
I'm done with kiel

32:43.670 --> 32:46.628
you and I need to take control
if we're ever going to get home.

33:28.215 --> 33:31.298
Hey. The worms are missing.

33:34.971 --> 33:35.971
Guys?

33:36.556 --> 33:37.556
The worms are gone.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.927
I did, I told you I did.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.929
We have to think about the fact that

33:46.024 --> 33:46.854
rullshit... no...

33:46.942 --> 33:48.002
There might be a larger problem.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.045
We're gonna solve this thing.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.229
And what it we can't?

33:50.904 --> 33:52.384
But we will, goddamn it!

33:52.739 --> 33:55.230
Who else can fix this up here? No one.

33:55.325 --> 33:57.862
Now you focus and you
get your shit together. Understand me?

33:59.538 --> 34:01.654
Speak to me like that again...

34:02.791 --> 34:05.533
Anhd you and I will have a
bigger problem than the Shepard.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.204
You copy?

34:12.007 --> 34:13.293
(Sive me the wrench.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.579
Nol!

35:15.488 --> 35:16.488
What?

35:18.867 --> 35:19.867
What?

35:22.829 --> 35:23.829
Excuse me?

35:30.503 --> 35:31.503
Yes.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.384
I know.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.786
Hey, schmidt.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.329
I ook at these moisture levels.

36:51.626 --> 36:52.626
Huh.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.295
- What are you doing here?
- No.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.414
What are you two doing up here?

37:00.552 --> 37:03.794
- Against commander's orders.
- I don't answer to you, volkov.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.378
- No?
- No.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.673
Then who are you answering to?

37:06.766 --> 37:08.744
- German intelligence?
- Where did you get the gun from?

37:08.768 --> 37:09.768
Please, put that down.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.105
- Chancellor gerlach?
- Put that gun down, volkov.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.769
Did gerlach gi...

37:13.857 --> 37:16.064
Stop it!

37:16.151 --> 37:18.267
Who gave you the wartime orders...

37:18.361 --> 37:20.477
Put the gun down!
You need help, volkov.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.299
- To sabotage the Shepard?
- Drop it!

37:22.323 --> 37:24.563
Are you crazy? Put that gun down!

37:37.380 --> 37:38.665
- Monk!
- Help!

37:38.757 --> 37:39.942
How long has he been like this?

37:39.966 --> 37:41.331
He tried to kill us.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.653
Tam, why do you have a gun?

37:42.677 --> 37:45.419
He came to us on x deck,
threatened us with this.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.949
- Lock it away.
- Now there's a gun?

37:46.973 --> 37:48.338
Since when is there a gun?

37:48.433 --> 37:49.553
What happened, monk?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.216
Whoa. What the hell?

37:53.688 --> 37:55.833
- Do something, monk.
- Monk, what's going on?

37:55.857 --> 37:56.937
I don't know.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.231
We have to help him!

38:01.154 --> 38:02.394
- Oh, god.
- No.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.157
No.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.004
Well, we found the worms.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.002
Hamilton, she's awake.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.159
Okay.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.341
Ava.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.717
How are you on this station?

39:51.389 --> 39:52.845
I have the same question for you.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.183
I don't know.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.391
I was heading to x-deck.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.513
Find Mundy.

40:02.609 --> 40:03.849
You know Mundy?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.023
Of course I know Mundy.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.421
We've been on this station for two years.

40:10.867 --> 40:11.867
Mundy, kiel...

40:12.493 --> 40:13.493
Volkov.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.740
Jesus... Christ, volkov.

40:19.584 --> 40:20.790
Everyone except her.

40:24.756 --> 40:25.756
Who is that woman?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.259
Who are you?

40:30.428 --> 40:31.508
What do you mean, who am I?

40:33.014 --> 40:34.014
It's me.

40:35.808 --> 40:36.808
Mina.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.426
Mina Jensen.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.186
- I'm the Shepard engineer.
- No, tam...

40:43.358 --> 40:44.814
Tam is the Shepard engineer.

40:44.901 --> 40:46.016
What are you talking about?

40:48.529 --> 40:50.925
What are you even doing here.
You're supposed to be on earth.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.439
Why would I be on earth?

40:52.533 --> 40:54.319
Because you're our civilian coordinator.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.031
We trained together since exomars six.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.309
We're friends. I'm your friend.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.333
We've never med.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.250
How can you not know who I am?

41:10.927 --> 41:11.967
None of you know who I am?

41:13.805 --> 41:14.840
None of us.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.883
I don't understand.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.215
I don't understand.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.177
I don't understand.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.519
How can you not know me?

41:29.487 --> 41:30.567
How can you not know me?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.482
I'm the Shepard engineer.

41:53.636 --> 41:54.636
Listen to me.

41:57.849 --> 41:58.849
Ava.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.759
Don't trust schmidt.

42:03.688 --> 42:04.688
What?

42:05.106 --> 42:06.106
It was him.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.064
Schmidt sabotaged the Shepard.

42:34.969 --> 42:35.969
Commander.

42:37.597 --> 42:38.597
What's going on?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.756
Kiel, have you lost your...

42:43.811 --> 42:44.971
You're making a mistake.

42:45.897 --> 42:46.932
Stay out of this.

42:54.155 --> 42:56.692
- Jensen warned us about you.
- The woman in the wall?

42:56.783 --> 42:58.774
- I checked your communication logs.
- So what?

42:58.868 --> 43:01.450
We deciphered your messages from the bnd.

43:01.537 --> 43:02.367
The bnd?

43:02.455 --> 43:04.411
We trusted you!

43:04.499 --> 43:06.205
For two years, schmidt.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.187
- What are you talking about, kiel?
- Two years. Two years.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.997
You were ordered by German intelligence

43:10.088 --> 43:11.828
to keep the Shepard offline

43:11.923 --> 43:13.629
until Russia was neutralized.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.173
- I swear to you on my life...
- I saw the order!

43:16.260 --> 43:18.072
- I never received such an order.
- I saw your response.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.586
Have you lost your mind?

43:19.680 --> 43:21.170
Maybe I am losing my mind.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.130
But I'm gonna do everything I can

43:23.226 --> 43:24.807
to keep us alive and get us home.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.595
Until I say otherwise,

43:28.689 --> 43:29.895
this is where you stay.

43:30.358 --> 43:31.768
You're trusting her and not me?

43:33.402 --> 43:34.608
You need me, kiel!

43:35.113 --> 43:36.113
Kiel!

43:40.368 --> 43:41.762
Citywide destruction has been reported,

43:41.786 --> 43:44.448
stretching from the downtown area
to the residential suburb.

43:44.539 --> 43:46.029
Michael, are you safe?

43:46.124 --> 43:48.365
No, I'm... I'm headed to the hospital.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.658
It's gonna be a mess.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.584
Listen, can you get this message to Ava.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.705
Tell her I'm going to be in triage
for the next 72 hours.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.837
Michael, listen. We're trying
to get some answers here, but...

43:58.928 --> 44:00.043
It's gone.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.173
The station.

44:01.639 --> 44:02.639
We lost signal.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.306
- What?
- I know.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.678
We're scanning everywhere.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.475
It's off comms, off radar.

44:08.563 --> 44:09.563
Did it break apart?

44:10.481 --> 44:12.472
- Did the station fail?
- We don't know.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.892
Look, I promise [I'll get back to you
as soon as I know anything.

44:16.654 --> 44:17.654
I'm so sorry.

44:18.406 --> 44:19.646
Just don't lose hope.

44:20.366 --> 44:21.822
I believe it's still up there.

44:22.702 --> 44:23.702
Somewhere.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.496
Michael?

44:27.248 --> 44:28.248
I'll call you back.

45:18.925 --> 45:20.916
Help!

45:27.975 --> 45:30.261
Help! Help!

45:39.445 --> 45:42.653
Help! Help!

45:45.743 --> 45:48.826
Help! Help!

45:48.913 --> 45:54.124
Help! Help!

45:54.210 --> 45:56.997
Help! Help!

46:14.063 --> 46:15.223
Oh, shit!

46:17.858 --> 46:18.858
What the...

46:20.319 --> 46:21.319
Help!

46:22.613 --> 46:23.613
Whoal

46:30.037 --> 46:31.493
Ouch! Jesus.

46:35.334 --> 46:36.824
- Mundy?
- Get me out of here.

46:39.839 --> 46:41.454
Help me!

46:42.258 --> 46:43.258
Shit!

46:46.095 --> 46:48.177
- Help Mel
- Hamilton, help me out.

46:48.264 --> 46:49.720
Kiel, it's pulling me further in.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.172
- Okay.
- Pull me out!

46:53.477 --> 46:54.683
Oh!

46:56.188 --> 46:58.270
Oh, man.

47:00.985 --> 47:03.192
Has anyone ever seen anything
like that before?

47:05.531 --> 47:06.531
Guys?

47:13.622 --> 47:14.622
Where's my arm?

47:18.210 --> 47:19.666
Where's my bloody arm?

47:24.717 --> 47:26.582
- No pain?
- No.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.168
Not physically.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.219
It's like he was born this way.

47:31.307 --> 47:32.513
Except I wasn't, was 1?

47:32.975 --> 47:34.215
He's in shock.

47:34.310 --> 47:36.663
Can you stop talking like I'm a kid
and these are my parents?

47:36.687 --> 47:37.687
Sorry.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.141
I don't know the rules... now.

47:45.529 --> 47:47.360
Do you think there's any chance it...

47:47.448 --> 47:49.063
Might grow back?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.029
I don't know.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.782
I don't know what to believe anymore.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.599
This your way of apologizing?

48:24.318 --> 48:25.433
Kiel?

48:35.121 --> 48:36.201
Kiel?

48:55.599 --> 48:57.869
I need the whole crew
on m-deck, as fast as you can.

48:57.893 --> 48:59.121
Who let you out of the airlock?

48:59.145 --> 49:00.260
Just get here, now.

49:03.482 --> 49:04.482
What is it?

49:09.321 --> 49:10.321
What is that?

49:18.414 --> 49:20.075
That's my fucking arm.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.658
Hold it quick! Hold my arm.

49:23.752 --> 49:25.333
Quickly, come on!

49:25.421 --> 49:26.536
Hold it!

49:27.214 --> 49:28.249
Easy with it.

49:29.258 --> 49:31.419
Are you controlling it?

49:31.510 --> 49:33.071
'Course I'm not controlling it.
It's over there.

49:33.095 --> 49:33.925
Are you sure?

49:34.013 --> 49:36.158
Yes, I'm sure because
I'm giving you the finger right now.

49:36.182 --> 49:37.342
How is that alive?

49:37.391 --> 49:39.006
Logic doesn't apply to any of this.

49:39.101 --> 49:40.932
One thing is clear. The overload did it.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.601
None of us believed it was real,

49:42.688 --> 49:45.020
- but this is the paradox.
- Excuse me?

49:45.107 --> 49:48.144
Particles interacting with each other
across two dimensions.

49:48.235 --> 49:49.520
Okay, I'm gonna sit down.

49:49.612 --> 49:52.319
Two distinct realities in a multiverse,

49:52.406 --> 49:54.738
fighting to occupy the same space,

49:54.825 --> 49:56.361
creating chaos.

49:56.952 --> 49:58.232
These aren't the things we know.

49:58.829 --> 50:01.320
Because... they don't belong to us.

50:01.415 --> 50:04.373
- Jensen.
- My communication logs.

50:08.214 --> 50:10.876
Uh, guys, check out my arm.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.112
I think my arm's trying
to write something.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.095
Somebody get a pen. Schmidt.

50:22.728 --> 50:23.934
This is madness.

50:25.981 --> 50:26.981
Go.

50:27.650 --> 50:28.650
Oh, that's creepy.

50:32.905 --> 50:33.940
"Cut...

50:34.031 --> 50:35.191
Volkov...

50:36.200 --> 50:37.200
Open"?

50:44.833 --> 50:46.243
What are you talking about, arm?

50:56.011 --> 50:58.423
- It's nothing personal, volky.
- Mundy.

50:58.514 --> 51:00.846
- What? He's our friend.
- He was about to shoot me.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.764
- Well, you know, before that.
- Guys.

51:06.897 --> 51:07.897
Monk?

51:09.441 --> 51:10.851
Sorry, I can't do this.

51:10.943 --> 51:12.103
Come on. You're the doctor.

51:12.945 --> 51:13.945
I can handle it

51:50.274 --> 51:51.559
There's something...

51:56.780 --> 51:57.940
What the...

51:58.616 --> 52:02.484
- No way, Jose.
- What the...

52:02.995 --> 52:04.405
Come on.

52:17.968 --> 52:19.571
So we're hoping
that the piece of equipment

52:19.595 --> 52:20.835
you found in someone's stomach

52:20.929 --> 52:22.465
is what's going to save the day.

52:23.098 --> 52:24.098
Good luck, everybody.

52:26.185 --> 52:27.345
Putting it on the viewscreen.

52:31.190 --> 52:32.805
Look, there's cassiopeia.

52:33.901 --> 52:35.141
It's upside down.

52:37.696 --> 52:38.811
We're upside down.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.485
Guys, we moved and we're upside down.

52:42.576 --> 52:43.986
Check the other side of the sun.

52:44.620 --> 52:45.620
Scanning.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.248
My arm helped us find the earth.

53:02.471 --> 53:03.677
Targeting all receivers.

53:07.393 --> 53:08.599
Yes!

53:10.562 --> 53:12.598
I'd clap, you know, if I could.

53:13.190 --> 53:14.630
Let's let 'em know we're still here.

53:16.777 --> 53:18.438
We can receive, but we can't transmit.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.048
Let's make that happen as fast as we can.

53:20.072 --> 53:21.312
Let's request a shuttle

53:21.407 --> 53:22.807
and give 'em status on the Shepard.

53:22.866 --> 53:24.697
And, uh, have them send us some champagne.

53:24.785 --> 53:25.820
Or some dumplings.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.947
Wait! Shh. Guys, listen.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.183
Sources say the number
of those killed today

53:30.207 --> 53:32.414
could be even greater
than the blitz on Berlin.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.457
The 14-month-old European war...

53:34.545 --> 53:36.581
- Fourteen months?
- Shows no sign of resolution.

53:36.672 --> 53:39.664
- This, as China sends warships further...
- Wait, what?

53:39.758 --> 53:42.028
What the hell are they talking about?
What's going on down there?

53:42.052 --> 53:44.008
Diplomats from all Chinese embassies.

53:44.096 --> 53:46.212
All this with nations still reeling

53:46.306 --> 53:49.013
after the destruction
of the cloverfield space station.

53:49.101 --> 53:51.057
Hamilton, is there video?

53:51.145 --> 53:54.262
Recent attempts to create
safe renewable energy, the orbiting...

53:54.356 --> 53:56.347
- Oh, my god.
- Viewscreen on.

53:56.442 --> 53:59.229
Experienced a catastrophic failure
just two days ago.

53:59.903 --> 54:02.144
Losing its brave crew of six,

54:02.239 --> 54:05.823
debris from the cloverfield has crashed
into the Atlantic ocean.

54:05.909 --> 54:07.649
Salvage crews are en route.

54:08.287 --> 54:10.619
President usman is set to make a statement

54:10.706 --> 54:13.118
from the Rose garden at 5:00 P.M.
eastern standard time.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.243
I don't get it.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.598
It's much worse than we thought.

54:17.045 --> 54:19.661
It's not just particles
of two dimensions interacting.

54:20.966 --> 54:23.924
- We've traveled to another one.
- Are on fire, literally.

54:24.011 --> 54:25.467
To another dimension?

54:25.554 --> 54:29.263
People are tearing down houses
for firewood, leading to...

54:29.349 --> 54:30.384
So, hold on.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.555
If that's not our earth...

54:34.396 --> 54:37.103
Can someone please explain to me
how we're supposed to get home?

54:37.191 --> 54:39.591
We have to get
the Shepard fixed and fire it again.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.860
What we know about quantum entanglement
dictates it should bring us back.

54:43.947 --> 54:45.562
And perhaps undo the damage we've done.

54:46.825 --> 54:48.907
It doesn't matter
what earth that is.

54:49.495 --> 54:51.577
We should go down and get help.

54:51.872 --> 54:52.872
We heed to go home...

54:52.998 --> 54:53.998
10 our home.

54:54.708 --> 54:56.994
I ook at them. At their war.

54:57.544 --> 55:00.206
That will be us if we don't get back.

55:00.297 --> 55:01.377
I'm with monk.

55:01.465 --> 55:02.830
I say we go to that earth,

55:02.925 --> 55:04.210
the one we can actually see,

55:04.301 --> 55:05.837
and get the hell off this station.

55:05.928 --> 55:07.714
That place cannot save us.

55:07.805 --> 55:10.137
The longer we stay here,
the more dangerous it is.

55:10.724 --> 55:13.215
For us and for everyone back home.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.759
All circuits are busy now.

55:27.783 --> 55:29.523
I can't get through to your home yet.

55:29.618 --> 55:30.858
The circuits are busy.

55:31.495 --> 55:33.360
That means no calls will go through.

55:33.956 --> 55:35.287
I know what it means.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.130
My uncle's dead.

55:53.183 --> 55:54.844
There's nothing you could've done.

55:56.979 --> 55:57.979
Molly.

56:00.732 --> 56:01.847
Molly.

56:03.443 --> 56:04.808
We're gonna find your parents.

56:06.113 --> 56:08.273
The most important thing right now
is keeping you safe.

56:18.792 --> 56:19.792
Thanks.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.669
You shouldn't text while driving.

56:30.304 --> 56:31.304
You're a smart kid.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.462
Only in emergencies.

56:34.641 --> 56:35.641
This qualifies.

56:46.904 --> 56:47.904
What did this?

56:52.451 --> 56:53.451
We're not sure.

56:55.913 --> 56:57.494
Bad things are happening.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.747
But good people are gonna make it better.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.832
We're gonna need a lot of good people.

57:20.729 --> 57:22.014
I'm gonna close the door.

57:43.627 --> 57:44.833
Let me look at your arm again.

57:45.587 --> 57:47.027
I'm gonna do a better job this time.

58:02.646 --> 58:03.681
Thanks, monk.

58:05.691 --> 58:07.272
You got it working, didn't you?

58:09.987 --> 58:11.022
You got it working.

58:11.905 --> 58:12.905
Something went wrong.

58:18.370 --> 58:21.487
Shepard smashed a higgs boson, overloaded.

58:22.541 --> 58:23.997
Somehow you ended up here.

58:29.089 --> 58:31.080
Your dimension crashed into mine.

58:37.597 --> 58:39.178
Crew must be working on power.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.261
Trying to fire the Shepard again
to get you back home.

58:44.021 --> 58:45.306
Could you do me a favor?

58:46.314 --> 58:49.226
Would you mind mentioning to your crew
that your escaping my dimension

58:49.317 --> 58:50.602
will trap me in yours?

58:53.989 --> 58:55.149
I' ve been thinking...

58:55.490 --> 58:57.321
When we put out the fire, we ventilated...

58:57.951 --> 59:00.488
What if condensation caused
the Shepard to overload?

59:01.621 --> 59:02.861
Ventilation could fix that.

59:03.457 --> 59:04.457
Run the numbers.

59:04.499 --> 59:05.705
I'll check the circuits.

59:43.455 --> 59:44.455
Tam.

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:05.222
Schmidt.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:20.026
Ml deck, I need help in airlock 6.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:21.357
I can't get out!

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.134
Tam!

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:39.593
Hold on!

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:43.048
- Hold on.
- It's jammed.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.550
We gotta try and override it.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.427
Tam, we're gonna get you out.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.582
- Hurry! Come on!
- It's not working.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:54.018
Come on! Mundy, let's do it manually.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.278
Pull!

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:12.165
Pull! Pull!

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:14.503
What's happening?

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:22.841
Get her out!

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.308
- Tam!
- Let go!

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:07.925
Tam figured out
what we've been doing wrong.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.974
Condensation has been
throwing off our numbers.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.760
We needed to ventilate.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.194
We can't stay here.

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.487
This dimension is eating us alive.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.118
We need to fix the Shepard
and use it to get home.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.026
We can't.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:30.781
Not without tam.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:34.875
Maybe not.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:47.836
Are you sure about this?

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:56.057
All circuits are busy now, please...

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.605
All circuits are busy now.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.869
- Hello?
- Joe, anything?

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:15.163
Not yet, but there's no debris.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.330
That's a hopeful sign.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.909
We're looking everywhere, I promise.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:20.481
We'll figure out what happened to them.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:21.905
It's the goddamn paradox, isn't it?

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:26.249
You can't find the station
because it isn't here anymore.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:30.800
And they did this too?
What's happening here?

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.660
Michael, I'll call you
as soon as I know anything.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.675
Look, I just need you to write this down.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:40.188
I need you to contact Andrew and Nancy
pontanius in Philadelphia.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:43.440
My phone's not going through. So just...

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.909
Just tell them their daughter,
Molly, is okay...

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:03.541
- Can you install tam's algorithm?
- Yes.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.247
But I want all of schmidt's work.
What?

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.211
Done. Kiel.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:11.420
Once we get the Shepard operational,
we give her your work.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:14.597
We put her on an escape pod
and we send her home with the specs.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.595
- What do you need?
- Power.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.331
Parts of the core are irreparably damaged.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.970
What's left isn't sufficient to fire.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:21.763
How much?

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.818
I'd like 210 kilowatts
for at least eight seconds.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.770
Possibly as much as 12.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.581
I'd like to take a bath
with identical twins

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.293
- and a tub of rocky road.
- Figure it out.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.230
Hamilton, get Jensen whatever she needs.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.245
Let's get this done
and get the hell out of here.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.576
- You can change in here.
- Thank you.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.460
Nothing of mine would fit you, but, uh...

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.332
- Try this.
- Thanks.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:57.095
You know, as odd as it is for me
to suddenly have you up here,

01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:00.018
I realize
it must be much stranger for you.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.855
Maybe I'm not the same Ava
you're friends with.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.019
No, you're the same.

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.114
A little sadder perhaps.
The situation calls for it.

01:05:28.216 --> 01:05:29.216
Mina?

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.005
Did you know my family?

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:35.764
Of course.

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:38.799
Michael, Isaac...

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:41.311
Ayana.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:44.979
And your friend was...

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.316
Strong enough to stay.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.732
- Stay where?
- On earth.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.279
After the fire.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.821
What fire?

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:02.499
The power cell.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:09.458
The one I put in the house,
so they could...

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:12.631
Have reading lights at night,
so they would feel safe.

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:17.598
The fire.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.091
It killed them both.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:39.745
Hi, Mina.

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:44.035
A little visitor has come to see you.

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:45.957
Hi, aunty Mina.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:51.371
- We love you.
- Yes, sending love.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.707
Why don't you tell aunty Mina
about your soccer results?

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:54.961
I scored seven goals.

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:56.759
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.382
You only scored five.

01:06:58.473 --> 01:06:59.929
At the 89th minute I scored.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:07.147
Ava...

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.232
In this world, your family's alive.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:15.604
They're on earth.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.322
That's why you didn't come up here.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.116
You're down there...

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:28.036
With them.

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:41.755
If I divert everything
non-life supporting from the station,

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:44.761
I can get us up to 170,
maybe, maybe 180 kilowatts.

01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:46.558
- That's not enough.
- 210, I know.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:49.103
So, I started thinking about
what life-supporting elements

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.476
we could sacrifice,
which is when I landed on this.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.188
If I shut down the O2,

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.319
- I can get us up to 240.
- Power down the O2 pumps.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.692
There are six of us.

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:01.195
That gives us two hours of oxygen,
more or less.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.368
So we turn off the O2 pumps,
fire the Shepard,

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:04.819
then route the power generated

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.620
by the now operational Shepard,

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.824
restart the pumps. That's clever.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:10.294
I'm clever.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.460
Kiel, I need you for a minute.

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:24.965
Anything you need, I'm here to help.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.265
I won't let you down.

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.582
We're all dealing with a lot.
We've just gotta keep it together.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.606
They're alive.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.515
In this place, my children are alive.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.402
I'll do everything you need,
comply with every order,

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:41.652
but if we do get the Shepard to fire again
to get back to where we came from...

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:44.487
I won't be here.

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.158
You wanna take a pod.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.350
With volkov and tam gone,
there are enough vehicles for everyone.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:52.207
Ava.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.314
This goes against regulation,
I know, but I don't care.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:56.830
I need to go to see them.
â€œWhat about Michael?

01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:59.540
And Jensen said you weren't
on the crew of her mission.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.843
- That means you're down there, too.
- I know.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:03.885
Ava, that's not your family down there,

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.462
that's hers.

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.219
What's gonna happen when you get there?

01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:11.848
You will never understand
what this is like.

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:14.024
No, I won't.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.854
But as much as you wanna
see them, this isn't right.

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:19.776
This isn't just about me.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:22.526
The Ava that's down there
wants the same thing I do.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:23.617
I know her.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.363
She'll steal energy for her family

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:29.069
just like I did, and they won't survive.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.660
I don't just need to see them...

01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:34.625
I need to save them.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.287
Michael would want me to.

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:44.638
Okay.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:54.140
- If we close...
- Let's turn off the oxygen.

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:56.627
The pumps will need to be deactivated
from the maintenance ring.

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:57.651
Yeah.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:00.226
That means you'll be working
inside a giant oxygen tank.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:01.811
- One spark and...
- Kaboom!

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.773
Yeah. No, I get it. Kentucky fried Mundy.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.547
- That's not funny.
- I'll be on my comms through 27.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:09.538
Yeah.

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:16.076
It's gonna be tight.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:21.460
Let's have a look at some of the problems
we might come into.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.837
Listen, kiel... trust me.

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:27.136
Even with one stumpy arm,
I think I can get this done.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.405
All right, Mundy. What's your progress?

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:58.121
Shutting down the auxiliary O2 pumps
in maintenance room three.

01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:01.079
I can't understand
anything you just said.

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:03.210
I'm nearly ready to transfer the oxygen.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:09.094
Okay, we're good.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.263
Standing by on x-deck.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:14.554
- Ready on m.
- All right, Mundy.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:19.858
Okay.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:21.683
The oxygen's pouring in.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.275
I can feel it.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:24.986
Where's the power, Jensen?

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:28.273
Test the actuator.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.577
- Mundy, good work.
- Hooh.

01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:44.664
I gotta say the pure oxygen
in here is sweet.

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:46.090
Whoa!

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:47.758
Guys?

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:49.836
No.

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:50.795
Guys?

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:51.890
Ow!

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:53.892
Mundy?

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:04.563
Guys? Are you having any
magnetic issues...

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.030
Mundy?

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.158
Mundy?

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.014
Help!

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:37.102
What the hell?

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:38.854
Mundy!

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:40.981
Guys!

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.702
- Mina? No!
- My god.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.947
The maintenance deck gets more unstable
with every rotation.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.437
It's only a matter of time
before that thing rips the station apart.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.218
The ring's spinning off axis
by 17 degrees.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.472
Anything more than 25...

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.020
It won't hold.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:04.641
We'll all be in pieces.

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:07.853
So we decouple the maintenance ring.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:11.269
If we're going to survive...

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.274
We have to.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:14.572
Not you, not Jensen.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.324
To do that job in the time we have...

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.939
It will have to be the three of us.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:29.781
I want to give you some comforting advice,

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.582
but I have no idea how this is gonna go.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:35.877
Gravity will be unpredictable,
so be sharp.

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:37.389
Follow my lead.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:42.971
The schmidt that betrayed you...

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:45.970
You realize he's not me, right?

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.030
Oh, my god.

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:20.630
This isn't gonna hold much longer.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.091
Let's get across.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:30.147
Monk, get moving.

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:39.232
The ring's at 20.2 degrees.

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.748
Monk, you're almost there.

01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:57.917
271.5 degrees.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:08.352
Monk, look at me.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.067
Give me your arm.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.395
22.3.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.230
Hamilton, you need to hurry.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.742
23.7 degrees.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.087
23.4 degrees. Keep moving.

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:44.422
I'm clearing the debris.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:11.911
It's jammed.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.380
23.9 degrees.
We have to jettison that ring.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.314
What is it?

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.026
Kiel?

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:40.527
We have to shut down the hydraulics.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.402
Let's go.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.903
24.2 degrees.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:49.766
Wait. Kiel, what are you doing?

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.122
To decouple the ring,
this portal has to be locked.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.396
Wait, no. Kiel, we can do this remotely...

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.832
I'm the commander of this station.
I have to do this.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.876
You can get the station home.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.047
You can do it.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:05.219
There's no other way. You have to.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.100
It's okay.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:13.557
Oh, Jesus. The ring's at 24.8 degrees.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:26.406
Oh. Oh, god.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:33.994
24.9 degrees.

01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:32.639
So, Emma just called
for a review at six.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:34.800
- How late?
- Super late.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:38.012
- Isaac with Jenny?
- Yeah. I'm getting him at three.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.143
Thank you.
Oh, don't forget his antibiotics.

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:43.400
- Yes, no, I won't forget.
- Yes, you won't,

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:45.648
- no, you won't. Okay.
- No. I won't forget.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.343
You have something in your hair.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:49.948
Where? There?

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.447
- No. No, the other side.
- Did I get it?

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:54.641
- Good?
- It's over there now.

01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:56.101
- Did I get it?
- You keep missing it.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.353
- Where is it? Oh my god, what is it?
- How do you keep missing it?

01:19:58.377 --> 01:19:59.938
- It's gone. You're good. Yeah.
- Are you sure?

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:01.356
Yeah. You got it
a few seconds ago.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.961
I was just being stupid.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.070
Hey, beautiful.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.067
Just in case I don't make it
through this...

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:37.867
What I wanted to say
the last time we spoke was...

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:41.294
Maybe we'll try again.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:52.837
There's no time to think about

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.298
what we could have done
or what we'll do one day.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.055
The only choice we have...

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.646
Is to save the people that we still can.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.478
What's our oxygen level?

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:11.564
We've got 43 good minutes left.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:15.266
We'll prep the Shepard to fire twice.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.786
Once to overload,
which should get us home.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.738
Then again,
with tam's equation programmed in,

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.824
which should give us the energy we need.

01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:24.956
Jensen, copy all our data
from the Shepard and take it home.

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:26.647
This should eventually help your planet.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:29.173
Schmidt, get the Shepard
to countdown mode.

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:31.587
Here's kiel's firing key.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:35.220
Jensen and I will take pod three down
before you fire the Shepard

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:36.762
and hopefully get home.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:39.102
Okay.

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:41.270
Okay.

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:23.431
Ava?

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.668
Shit. Jensen.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.074
No.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.961
We all set on x-deck?

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:42.888
What are you doing?

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:44.967
I need the firing keys.

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:48.311
I can't let you take the Shepard.

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:52.433
I can't do that.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:55.519
It's not a request, monk.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:57.605
Please. Jensen.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:06.159
I'm sorry, but I need that key.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:24.183
No. No. No.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:25.893
Monk.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.805
Monk. No.

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:44.102
I won't let you take the Shepard
away from my world, schmidt.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.786
Jensen. Please.

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.158
Why've you come back?

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:50.366
You could've gone home.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:53.411
We were a crew.
We were never a crew.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:55.666
- Stay away from her, Hamilton.
- This had to happen

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.122
from the moment you wiped my crew,

01:24:57.217 --> 01:24:58.878
my station, from existence.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:01.835
- No.
- You can't have it both ways, Ava.

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:04.717
Your family here but the Shepard there.

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.218
You had everything you needed.

01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:08.121
We couldn't rebuild the Shepard
fast enough. Think.

01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:10.136
People are dying down there, every day.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.061
So, you're just gonna kill us?

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:14.936
If you're asking me if I am willing
to kill three people

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:17.984
to save eight billion...

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.193
Wouldn't you?

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:30.791
Go!

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:32.411
Go!

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:29.558
Ava.

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.426
Don't fail them again.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:36.763
That is your family down there.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.660
The same kids.

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:50.869
The same man you married.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.584
Hi, aunty Mina!

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:02.919
- Love you.
- Yes, sending love.

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:05.196
Um... why don't you tell
aunty Mina about...

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.552
You don't know
how bad it is down there.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:12.807
It'll only get worse.

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:26.067
Listen to their voices, Ava.

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.359
They need you.

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:44.460
You may be willing
to kill your children again.

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:53.011
But I won't let
those people down there die.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:37.430
Yes, I did. I learned my back handspring.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.245
Ava.

01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:25.224
I don't know.
Found an extra tickle.

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:52.959
I don't know where to start.

01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:00.892
But this isn't my world.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.523
As much as I want it to be.

01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:10.988
It isn't mine.

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:20.783
It's yours.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:23.577
Ava.

01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:27.043
You're not losing your mind. I promise.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.790
There's no other way to say this.

01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:35.839
I'm you.

01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:39.843
I have to be quick.

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:43.097
Attached to this message
are detailed construction

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:45.429
and operation plans
for the Shepard accelerator.

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:48.932
I'm praying it helps your planet.

01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:51.108
I have the same hope for mine.

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:58.734
I need to say two things
that won't make sense to you.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.319
But, please, hear me.

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:04.740
And understand how important
these both are.

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.128
First...

01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:12.497
If you've installed the power cell
at the house,

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:15.458
take it out, now.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.966
It's wrong, and it's dangerous.

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:21.890
And if these plans work,
you won't need to siphon power anyway.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:25.729
And two...

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.227
Whatever you're doing right now,

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:33.313
whatever meeting you're in

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:35.566
or wherever you're going, stop.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:40.112
Go to your husband and your children...

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:42.823
Right now.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:47.749
Go to them... and hold them.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.954
Hold them for as long as you can.

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:55.961
Kiss them and love them.

01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:58.134
And know how blessed you are

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.795
to have them in your life.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.469
That's all there is.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:09.182
That's all there is.

01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:39.255
Three... two... one...

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:40.804
Mark.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.042
Cloverfield, do you copy?

01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:23.298
Huntsville, this is Hamilton.
Can you hear us?

01:33:23.389 --> 01:33:24.595
Where have you guys been?

01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:27.173
That's something of a conversation.

01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:30.059
We can explain later. Listen...

01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:32.353
I'd rush an emergency team
up here for repairs.

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.764
Schmidt and I are all that's left.

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:41.066
Huntsville?

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:43.531
What did you do up there?

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.154
What's going on with the Shepard?

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:46.954
Stand by.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.283
We have a stable beam.

01:34:39.132 --> 01:34:41.293
The Shepard...

01:34:41.384 --> 01:34:42.464
Is working.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.825
Michael, we got them.

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:15.908
You did? You found them?

01:35:16.002 --> 01:35:17.458
Ava, the station.

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:18.580
We made contact.

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:27.168
She can't wait to see you.
She's coming back.

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:28.844
You're having her come back to earth?

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:30.842
Do they know what's happening here?

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:32.219
No, there wasn't time.

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:33.550
We lost contact.

01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:42.396
Listen, just get to the Delaware coast.
She's splashing down at 4:30.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:46.793
You're having her come back
to these things?

01:35:46.866 --> 01:35:48.356
There's nothing we could do.

01:35:48.451 --> 01:35:49.736
They couldn't stay up there.

01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:56.602
- Michael, there wasn't a choice.
- There is a choice.

01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:58.787
- Tell them not to come back.
- Listen to me.

01:35:58.878 --> 01:36:00.856
- You have to listen...
- Tell them not to come back!

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.666
Tell them not to come back!

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:05.123
Do you hear me?
Tell them not to come back!
