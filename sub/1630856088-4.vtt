WEBVTT

00:51.426 --> 00:52.427
Fine.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.304
Fine.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.002
What the hell?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.483
Hi. It's Barnes.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.944
I'm getting a really weird
reading out here and--

01:51.695 --> 01:52.696
Barnes.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.824
Outpost 47. Yeah.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.619
I need to speak to
Assistant Director Verdugo--

02:00.287 --> 02:01.872
Yeah. I'll hold.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.470
Du-Ho.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.056
Down!

02:21.016 --> 02:22.017
Kentaro!

02:24.311 --> 02:25.938
Kentaro, run!

02:25.938 --> 02:27.397
- Come on. Move on.
- Run!

02:30.400 --> 02:31.443
Let's go. Come on.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.077
Shit.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.642
- Nice shooting, Tex.
- At least I tried.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.894
- You could've gotten killed, you idiot.
- Quiet.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.957
What do we do now?

05:32.457 --> 05:33.834
We can't fight it.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.252
I wouldn't recommend it.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.226
I think we're in the clear for the moment.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.855
- Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!
- No, no.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.942
My legs are soaking wet.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.570
Then we gotta move quick.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.074
Come on, May.
Get up. Get up, get up.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.743
Come on. May, you good?

06:07.743 --> 06:09.953
Am I good?
I'm gonna die of hypothermia.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.371
Are you happy we came?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.173
Your work is a bold statement.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.841
Why this?

06:22.841 --> 06:24.092
Why now?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.056
House lights!

06:31.099 --> 06:32.059
You hesitated.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.853
It's a complicated question.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.649
And you've had months to
come up with an answer.

06:38.857 --> 06:39.816
Art...

06:40.442 --> 06:43.737
...comes from a place you don't
feel comfortable talking about.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.113
To me it's just intuitive.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.450
I respect your process.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.621
But if buyers are going
to plunk down money, good money,

06:52.621 --> 06:56.416
they want to know what they are getting.
Who they are getting.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.126
People...

06:58.126 --> 06:59.169
...don't buy the art--

06:59.169 --> 07:00.671
they buy the artist.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.048
I know, Kimi.

07:03.048 --> 07:03.966
I'm sorry.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.551
You have two hours before
we open the doors

07:05.551 --> 07:07.761
to figure out an answer
that makes me believe you.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.639
We both have a lot at stake tonight.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.062
Hey, Mom.

07:17.729 --> 07:22.442
"Kentaro Randa's assertive
exploration of parallels and interiors

07:22.442 --> 07:27.573
invites the viewer to challenge
their assumptions about identity."

07:29.032 --> 07:32.244
Who knew my son was so provocative?

07:32.870 --> 07:34.162
I'm not.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.332
Everyone's going to love it.

07:37.332 --> 07:41.295
It wouldn't be very "provocative"
if everyone loved it.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.550
Hey...

07:47.009 --> 07:48.302
...I'm proud of you.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.804
So is your father.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.765
He hasn't even seen it.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.268
He will tonight.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.062
He's coming straight from the airport.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.234
I'm going to get some air...

08:06.111 --> 08:10.032
...before everyone wants to meet
the "provocative" new artist.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.703
Kentaro...

08:14.703 --> 08:16.496
...you've worked hard for this.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.748
You deserve it.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.294
There are snacks.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.307
Did you just take my picture?

08:35.682 --> 08:36.600
No.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.811
Bullshit.

08:39.811 --> 08:40.979
I saw you.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.813
I was taking a picture
of my poster for my show,

08:42.813 --> 08:46.193
and you walked in front of it
gawking like a tourist.

08:50.113 --> 08:53.116
"Parallels and Interiors."
Sounds pretentious.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.368
Incredibly.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.795
You know what would be
incredibly respectful is if you...

09:10.050 --> 09:11.093
Yeah.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.096
- Deleted.
- Thank you.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.226
Is there a reason you don't like
your picture being taken?

09:22.521 --> 09:23.522
I...

09:24.022 --> 09:25.607
It's a very nice picture.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.697
Are you hitting on me?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.199
Just being honest.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.247
Is this really you?

09:41.957 --> 09:42.958
Yeah.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.543
Is there wine?

09:47.462 --> 09:50.591
It's cheap. Bad. Pretentious.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.260
Pretentious wine.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.636
Right.

09:54.636 --> 09:55.929
Do you like whiskey?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.223
I like expensive whiskey.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.934
You're in luck. Japan has
some very expensive whiskey.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.729
Cool.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.439
- I know a place.
- Now?

10:05.439 --> 10:07.191
But don't you have a show?

10:09.568 --> 10:10.903
I'll make an entrance later.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.114
Okay.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.574
I'm Kentaro.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.160
I'm May.

10:18.869 --> 10:19.870
May.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.706
May. Where are you going? Slow down.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.916
Slow down?

10:24.833 --> 10:27.669
Unless you want to add a set of toes
to what you already owe me,

10:27.669 --> 10:28.795
you need to speed your ass up.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.797
He's right, May. Conserve your energy.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.883
Wet legs,
you're gonna be fighting hypothermia.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.051
We gotta get you dry.

10:34.051 --> 10:37.554
No. Even if there was anything out here
to build a fire with,

10:37.554 --> 10:40.015
we can't sit still
with that Titan on the prowl.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.227
- You still think it's out there?
- Hell if I know.

10:43.227 --> 10:46.480
What are you ta-- What happened to
your centuries of experience now, huh?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.940
It's a Titan, May.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.067
They're like snowflakes.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.736
Never came across two that were same.

10:52.736 --> 10:56.657
Okay. Well, maybe there's some info
on these precious files of yours.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.741
Go to hell

10:57.741 --> 11:00.786
- and take your life's work with you.
- Hey. Easy with these. Now come on, May.

11:00.786 --> 11:01.995
Once the sun goes down,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.664
the temperature's gonna drop
by the minute.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.457
We've got no food, no shelter.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.959
No Du-Ho.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.627
Where the hell are we going?

11:08.627 --> 11:10.796
Northwest. We head for the coast.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.173
Greater probability
of running into people there.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.260
- I think I saw something from the plane.
- What?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.178
Saw what?

11:18.178 --> 11:21.139
Some kind of structure.
Looked like a big golf ball.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.601
It had to be man-made,
like a building or settlement.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.478
All right. All right.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.063
Did either one of you see it?

11:28.063 --> 11:29.147
No.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.734
But May did.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.528
What? No.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.780
No. You said you saw something.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.865
I didn't see anything.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.992
You're taking their side?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.035
Is it 'cause you're pissed at me?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.997
No. This has nothing to do with you.
This is about me freezing to death.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.623
I'm trying to save you. Will you just--

11:46.623 --> 11:47.708
Trust me.

11:57.593 --> 11:58.719
Sota?

11:58.719 --> 11:59.678
<i>Password.</i>

11:59.678 --> 12:01.346
Sota. It's me, man. Kentaro.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.472
<i>Who?</i>

12:02.472 --> 12:03.557
Kentaro.

12:03.932 --> 12:04.933
<i>Password.</i>

12:06.059 --> 12:09.271
Okay. Forget about it.
This place is a dump.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.189
Dump!

12:11.940 --> 12:12.941
Hurry up!

12:21.033 --> 12:22.784
Dump?!

12:22.784 --> 12:24.119
She didn't mean it.

12:24.828 --> 12:25.829
Prove me wrong.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.624
I like you.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.126
And you're too easy to mess with.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.508
Okay. You've proved me wrong.

12:38.509 --> 12:39.593
May, this is Sota.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.053
Owner.

12:41.053 --> 12:41.970
Manager.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.222
Asshole.

12:43.222 --> 12:44.640
Guilty of all charges.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.976
Wait. You have your own bottle?

12:48.894 --> 12:50.479
You are as pretentious as I thought.

12:50.479 --> 12:51.563
That's how it works here.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.814
Uh-huh.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.485
- But maybe we can do better.
- Okay.

13:00.906 --> 13:01.740
Okay.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.242
So, you're a successful artist.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.368
I designed the lighting here.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.454
- What? No way.
- Yeah.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.083
So, he lets me pretend,
and even open early for me.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.717
What do you do?

13:21.760 --> 13:22.845
Computer shit.

13:23.345 --> 13:27.391
It's not nearly as interesting as art.
How long have you been doing it?

13:27.391 --> 13:28.475
Since I was little.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.644
But as a job, I guess, since tonight.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.188
What? Like-- What do you mean?

13:33.188 --> 13:35.065
- Like, tonight's your first show?
- Yeah.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.193
Don't you feel like you should be there?

13:38.777 --> 13:40.237
I'm letting the suspense build.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.740
- It's all part of the act.
- Part of the act.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.075
Is this part of the act?

13:45.075 --> 13:46.451
What do you mean?

13:46.451 --> 13:50.122
The secret whiskey bar and you,
the artist, next big thing.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.041
Does he bring other girls?

13:53.041 --> 13:55.502
As a bartender, I can't say.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.379
Asshole.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.590
I mean, I didn't say it was a bad act.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.091
I mean, as far as acts go.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.219
This isn't an act.

14:06.805 --> 14:10.809
I judge an artist based on their art,
not on a suit and a haircut.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.157
What?

14:25.657 --> 14:27.534
Why isn't this stuff in the gallery?

14:28.076 --> 14:29.703
These aren't for sale.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.375
You're definitely
more than just a haircut.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.712
Kimi sent me to her stylist.

14:39.671 --> 14:40.964
People buy the artist.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.718
I mean, sure.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.056
Rich pricks who have
more money than good taste.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.144
Why don't you tell Kimi
what pieces you want in the show?

14:56.939 --> 14:57.981
It's her gallery.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.527
- She was taking a chance on me--
- Chance on you?

15:02.945 --> 15:04.655
Like, out of the goodness of her heart?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.199
Come on. That's bullshit.

15:07.741 --> 15:11.411
People don't give other people a shot
unless there's something in it for them.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.540
That's pretty cynical.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.251
That's life.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.677
You should probably go.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.763
The rich pricks are waiting.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.271
Come with me.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.148
Not really my crowd.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.233
Mine either.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.986
Get used to it, hotshot.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.574
Wait.

15:53.662 --> 15:54.663
Okay.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.373
Now you can go.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.562
Okay.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.980
Somebody has to say it.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.232
I don't see any buildings.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.485
It must be behind those hills.

16:26.612 --> 16:27.613
Must it?

16:27.613 --> 16:29.823
- Kentaro, we agreed--
- You all agreed.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.617
You got passion, kid. I'll give you that.

16:31.617 --> 16:34.369
- Stop treating me like a kid.
- Hold on.

16:35.120 --> 16:35.996
I know what I saw.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.206
- No, no, no.
- What?

16:37.206 --> 16:38.290
Over there.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.335
- What? Where?
- Right there. What is that?

16:41.335 --> 16:42.461
Oh, yeah. I see it.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.088
I don't know. Lights on an oil rig maybe,
or a local settlement.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.216
Point is, it's out there, right?

16:48.467 --> 16:50.636
- We follow something we can all see.
- Yeah.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.803
You don't know how far that is.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.264
That Titan can catch you
before you get halfway there.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.891
Whatever I saw is closer.

16:55.891 --> 16:58.644
- Yeah, if it exists.
- Okay. Kentaro.

16:59.895 --> 17:04.191
Look, you have a brilliant imagination,
but now is not the time to use it.

17:05.776 --> 17:06.609
I'm going.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.863
Alone if I have to.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.657
Oh, my God. You obstinate asshole.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.286
- So, what? You wanna die to prove a point?
- Do you?

17:16.286 --> 17:18.454
- No.
- Stop. Stop. Please, stop.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.250
You think you saw something?

17:21.250 --> 17:22.376
Yeah. I know what I saw.

17:22.376 --> 17:26.421
Then go, and don't stop until you find it,
and then get help.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.506
We'll do the same.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.300
Good luck.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.844
We're all gonna need it.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.561
No. We can't just let him leave.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.855
He's made his choice, Cate. Let's go.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.495
Dr. Barnes, I understand
you have something for us?

17:58.495 --> 18:00.664
<i>Yeah. Hold on. Sharing my screen now.</i>

18:00.664 --> 18:02.291
- What are we looking at here?
- <i>Radiation.</i>

18:02.291 --> 18:04.376
<i>Specifically, gamma rays
in the 30 exahertz range.</i>

18:04.376 --> 18:07.045
- Where is this radiation coming from?
- <i>That's the crazy thing.</i>

18:07.045 --> 18:09.298
<i>You only see these kinds
of spikes from pulsars.</i>

18:09.298 --> 18:12.301
<i>Supermassive black holes from outer space.</i>

18:12.301 --> 18:13.635
- But not this?
- <i>No.</i>

18:13.635 --> 18:15.095
<i>This was coming from the earth.</i>

18:15.095 --> 18:16.305
Where exactly on the earth?

18:16.305 --> 18:18.932
<i>Well, the detector that picked it up
is an old model,</i>

18:18.932 --> 18:20.017
<i>it's pretty much an antique.</i>

18:20.017 --> 18:22.019
- <i>They're pretty finicky.</i>
- I'll note it in the next budget request.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.770
- Where?
- <i>It was a rhythmic pulse,</i>

18:23.770 --> 18:25.522
<i>well, like a pulsar</i>

18:25.522 --> 18:28.609
<i>but as far as I know,
there aren't any pulsars in Alaska.</i>

18:30.110 --> 18:32.112
Thank you, Dr. Barnes.
Send us everything you have

18:32.112 --> 18:34.364
and we'll get an analysis team
out to you right away.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.241
<i>Wait! That's not the big thing.</i>

18:36.241 --> 18:38.410
<i>The last time anyone
saw readings like this</i>

18:38.410 --> 18:40.537
<i>was right before the last emergence event.</i>

18:41.121 --> 18:42.956
<i>From Janjira and Yucca Flats.</i>

18:42.956 --> 18:44.416
Before G-Day.

18:59.932 --> 19:01.975
<i>Kentaro!</i>

19:01.975 --> 19:03.310
May?

19:03.894 --> 19:04.895
Is that you?

19:05.979 --> 19:07.689
<i>Kentaro!</i>

19:07.689 --> 19:08.857
Cate?

19:09.650 --> 19:10.651
Shaw?

19:35.717 --> 19:38.178
<i>We shouldn't have let Kentaro go.</i>

19:38.762 --> 19:40.347
He won't survive the night.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.766
He just needs to hang on
until we get help.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.982
- Come on, May, let me carry that bag.
- No. Stop. No!

19:49.982 --> 19:51.066
He wants something.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.193
She's getting delirious.

19:55.654 --> 19:57.823
Few more steps, okay?

19:58.657 --> 20:01.118
Think of how warm it'll be
when we get there.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.122
Blankets, hot coffee.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.040
Whiskey.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.334
Come on.

20:32.191 --> 20:33.192
No.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.336
Shit.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.881
What? We're back at Dad's tent?

20:58.467 --> 20:59.801
How did this happen?

21:00.302 --> 21:01.637
We're walking in circles.

21:02.221 --> 21:05.599
Titans have odd effects
on their surroundings

21:05.599 --> 21:07.601
and how we experience them.

21:07.601 --> 21:12.105
The cloud we flew through, this place,
it's stranger than you think.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.858
It's stranger than anybody knows.

21:21.615 --> 21:23.867
If we don't warm her up, she's gonna die.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.411
We can all die if that Titan's still here.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.288
Well, I'm not leaving here without her.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.874
We are not losing another person.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.143
Beautiful.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.156
It is.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.956
Tell me why you don't wanna go
to your gallery opening again.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.670
Why does it matter to you if I go?

22:18.630 --> 22:19.715
Well, it doesn't.

22:19.715 --> 22:23.927
But I don't think you should be ashamed
to take credit for what you do.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.721
What do you do?

22:30.058 --> 22:32.811
I just brought you here
and bared my artist's soul.

22:33.812 --> 22:35.856
You haven't told me shit about yourself.

22:35.856 --> 22:38.275
I told you. I do computer shit.

22:38.275 --> 22:39.735
- Computer shit?
- Yeah.

22:39.735 --> 22:40.819
Yeah, okay. Come on.

22:53.999 --> 22:58.337
I'm from Tacoma. Tacoma sucks.
So, I came to Japan.

22:59.213 --> 23:00.631
Japan is cool.

23:01.507 --> 23:02.341
Is that better?

23:03.133 --> 23:04.134
I'm sorry.

23:04.635 --> 23:06.887
It's okay. You didn't make Tacoma suck.

23:11.308 --> 23:14.520
So, you can stay as long as you want,
or you can come with me?

23:14.520 --> 23:15.896
This is your party.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.732
I've already seen all the best stuff.

23:19.483 --> 23:20.817
Can I see you again?

23:26.990 --> 23:29.034
- Give me your number.
- This is your phone?

23:29.034 --> 23:30.702
Yeah. I like a physical button.

23:34.706 --> 23:35.707
You need to--

23:37.125 --> 23:38.168
Ignore it.

23:40.838 --> 23:42.172
Try not to break anything.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.132
How would you tell?

23:56.228 --> 23:57.688
Hello? Hey.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.315
I'm traveling.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.442
For work, yeah.

24:05.362 --> 24:08.073
No. Look, you gotta stop calling me.

24:11.118 --> 24:12.911
I'll call you when I'm back, yeah?

24:14.955 --> 24:15.956
Okay, you too.

24:17.082 --> 24:18.083
Yeah, bye.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.107
Beautiful.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.694
Beautiful.

24:46.987 --> 24:49.489
- This shit is so beautiful.
- May.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.285
Stay with me. May. May.

24:54.870 --> 24:56.330
My legs are burning.

24:57.039 --> 24:58.415
Like pins and needles?

24:58.415 --> 25:00.375
More like swords and daggers.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.211
That's really good.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.630
Your nerves are waking up.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.006
You don't have frostbite yet.

25:06.590 --> 25:07.716
Yet.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.092
Good bedside manner.

25:12.095 --> 25:17.893
Hey. If anything happens to me,
just get in touch with my sister.

25:17.893 --> 25:20.395
Her name is Lyra.

25:20.395 --> 25:21.688
No. Let's not go there.

25:22.940 --> 25:25.943
She's the only person that I can call.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.030
I'm gonna give you her number.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.156
I'm sure Kentaro knows h--

25:31.156 --> 25:33.951
No. He doesn't know shit.

25:33.951 --> 25:36.161
Hope you're not talking about me.

25:37.246 --> 25:39.039
Compliments of Du-Ho.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.708
Crackers and chocolate.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.919
How's she doing?

25:44.419 --> 25:45.379
Better.

25:54.555 --> 25:56.807
All right. Her pants are dry.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.063
We're gonna have to stoke that fire.

26:04.356 --> 26:07.568
This is nothing but kindling.
I mean, it's not gonna last very long.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.697
And who knows what's in your dad's papers.

26:12.364 --> 26:15.367
I mean, it could tell us
what he was doing here.

26:16.493 --> 26:19.329
Theories, discoveries, where he went.

26:25.002 --> 26:26.170
Let it burn.

26:45.022 --> 26:47.858
Get your gear on! We gotta move! Come on!

26:47.858 --> 26:49.276
Get back to where we hid before.

26:49.276 --> 26:50.444
- Come on.
- May!

26:52.779 --> 26:54.156
Go, go, go, go, go!

26:56.325 --> 26:58.285
- May.
- Wait, wait. Stop. Don't move.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.205
It could be anywhere. Listen.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.680
I can't run from that thing anymore.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.228
We may not have to.

27:24.728 --> 27:28.524
This morning,
Outpost 47 registered readings

27:28.524 --> 27:31.610
I consider noteworthy.

27:32.819 --> 27:33.862
Dr. Barnes.

27:34.363 --> 27:35.822
- Oh, my God.
- What?

27:35.822 --> 27:38.700
That can't be right.
These readings mirror--

27:38.700 --> 27:41.119
The gamma-ray flare
before the San Francisco...

27:42.663 --> 27:43.664
event.

27:44.331 --> 27:46.542
Call it what it was. An attack.

27:46.542 --> 27:48.877
Well, what do you suggest?
Full mobilization?

27:48.877 --> 27:51.255
- Try out your Titan warning system?
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

27:51.255 --> 27:53.674
- Create a worldwide panic?
- Better than a thousand dead.

27:53.674 --> 27:55.467
- <i>Or 10,000.</i>
- Excuse me.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.803
We don't know if these creatures
have malevolent intent.

27:57.803 --> 28:00.055
- <i>Excuse me!</i>
- Quiet down.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.934
Tim, you have something?

28:03.934 --> 28:07.062
<i>We can't dismiss Bill Randa's files.</i>

28:07.062 --> 28:10.357
Now, look, Lee Shaw was there.
He knows something that we don't.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.818
- <i>That's why he's going after the files.</i>
- Quiet!

28:14.194 --> 28:17.364
<i>Most of you all don't know me,
and if you do,</i>

28:17.364 --> 28:21.869
<i>I'm the troll from the basement
that you try to avoid in the break room.</i>

28:22.578 --> 28:25.497
It's fine. It's not like I work here
for the after-work karaoke anyway.

28:25.497 --> 28:26.707
Your point.

28:28.125 --> 28:30.919
<i>I thought that we were here</i>

28:31.503 --> 28:35.382
<i>to learn everything we can
in any way that we can</i>

28:35.883 --> 28:39.428
<i>so no one else has to lose
another loved one in a Titan event.</i>

28:39.928 --> 28:42.556
<i>And I would've thought
that a bunch of people</i>

28:42.556 --> 28:47.436
<i>who signed up to study
giant, atomic-powered monsters</i>

28:47.936 --> 28:49.771
<i>would be a little bit more
open-minded about it.</i>

28:52.816 --> 28:56.236
We may be knocked on our asses
but we're not done yet,

28:56.737 --> 28:58.780
'cause now we know how our enemy works.

28:59.489 --> 29:00.616
- We do?
- Yeah.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.285
That Titan didn't go after us,
it went after the fire.

29:03.994 --> 29:07.497
Didn't go after Kentaro, it went after
that burning airplane engine.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.501
That's how it's tracking us.

29:11.043 --> 29:12.878
It's drawn to the heat. Oh, my God.

29:12.878 --> 29:15.589
Then why did it toss that airplane
like a chew toy,

29:16.632 --> 29:18.133
and come chasing after us?

29:18.884 --> 29:22.095
Because my brother tried saving our asses
by shooting a flare at it.

29:22.095 --> 29:24.556
And after the flare,
we were the warmest things.

29:26.892 --> 29:30.479
And this is how we beat this damn thing.

29:31.146 --> 29:34.858
We dangle the biggest, brightest,
hottest object we can in front of it.

29:34.858 --> 29:37.110
Never been so thankful for a full bladder.

29:37.110 --> 29:39.154
Aviation fuel.

29:39.154 --> 29:40.239
Flint.

29:40.239 --> 29:43.700
Gonna light this thing brighter
than Times Square on VJ Day.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.077
What? What day?

29:45.077 --> 29:47.412
We build a bonfire. We feed it.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.832
And then while that Titan's
absorbing its heat,

29:51.416 --> 29:54.753
we hightail it to the coast.
I'll carry you if I have to.

30:15.774 --> 30:17.776
May, just a little further, okay?

30:18.569 --> 30:19.486
We're gonna make it.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.156
I'm not.

30:24.741 --> 30:28.787
Sooner or later
you're gonna have to ditch me, okay?

30:30.873 --> 30:32.791
Yes. And if the time comes,

30:33.834 --> 30:35.335
you ditch him too.

30:36.712 --> 30:38.380
Save yourself, Cate.

30:39.173 --> 30:41.592
One of us
has to make it out of here alive.

30:55.230 --> 30:56.398
<i>Who's there?</i>

31:00.694 --> 31:01.695
Hello?

31:07.701 --> 31:09.995
- Hello?
- <i>What are you doing here?</i>

31:11.038 --> 31:12.206
Are you real?

31:13.624 --> 31:15.417
<i>I thought I was alone.</i>

31:16.460 --> 31:17.503
So did I.

31:17.503 --> 31:18.921
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

31:26.929 --> 31:28.305
Dad...

31:33.852 --> 31:34.978
Don't leave me!

31:35.938 --> 31:37.189
Wait, Dad!

31:37.898 --> 31:38.899
It's me!

31:40.359 --> 31:41.360
Don't...

33:56.453 --> 33:57.913
I did sell a few pieces...

34:01.291 --> 34:03.293
...but Kimi dropped me anyway.

34:08.841 --> 34:11.051
"It's a huge opportunity," you said.

34:13.762 --> 34:15.097
"You're so talented."

34:16.181 --> 34:17.391
"You can do this."

34:18.225 --> 34:20.018
"I believe in you."

34:20.561 --> 34:22.771
That's what you said that time.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.400
How the hell...

34:28.150 --> 34:29.862
...would you know
if I was ready or not?

34:30.571 --> 34:32.989
But I didn't want to disappoint you.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.534
So I couldn't face you...

34:38.745 --> 34:41.748
How was I supposed to know
I'd never see you again?

34:42.416 --> 34:43.625
Dad?

34:48.589 --> 34:51.925
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

34:52.551 --> 34:54.052
Everybody loved it.

34:54.803 --> 34:56.263
Your mother loved it.

34:56.263 --> 34:57.639
I loved it too.

34:58.682 --> 34:59.933
I'm proud of you.

35:01.727 --> 35:02.728
Congratulations.

35:56.657 --> 35:58.408
Are we really doing this?

35:58.909 --> 36:00.577
It's a funeral pyre, Cate.

36:01.203 --> 36:03.956
Du-Ho always wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

36:03.956 --> 36:08.418
I'm just pouring one out for the guy
who loved getting one over on me.

36:08.961 --> 36:12.798
First night we met, brother,
I couldn't believe

36:12.798 --> 36:16.051
how you were drinking me
underneath the table that night.

36:16.051 --> 36:18.554
And then I realized

36:18.554 --> 36:20.931
- every time you took a shot...
- Do you hear that?

36:20.931 --> 36:22.391
- Shaw. Shaw! It's--
- ...all you really--

36:30.107 --> 36:32.609
- Go! Run!
- May!

36:34.820 --> 36:37.281
Hey, big boy! Big boy! Over here!

36:38.782 --> 36:41.243
Oh, Jesus. No. Where is it? No.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.915
Help! Help! Help!

36:54.631 --> 36:56.967
Need a shield to ride a rocket ship.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.094
Dinner time, you son of a bitch.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.524
May, come on.

37:12.524 --> 37:13.734
You can do this.

37:15.319 --> 37:16.403
The chopper! Let's go.

37:49.853 --> 37:51.605
- May! Come on!
- Oh, shit.

37:52.689 --> 37:53.815
I got you!

37:55.400 --> 37:56.568
- Come on, hurry!
- Kentaro!

37:56.568 --> 37:57.986
- Let's go!
- Kentaro?

37:57.986 --> 38:00.072
- Come on. Go.
- Go. Go.

38:02.157 --> 38:03.283
Pick it up!

38:35.065 --> 38:36.400
They said the signal was so weak,

38:36.400 --> 38:38.902
they almost didn't hear me
on the emergency channel.

38:41.196 --> 38:44.199
I never thought I'd thank someone
for abandoning their family,

38:44.199 --> 38:45.784
but here we are.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.162
Dad was there. Before me.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.207
- Just like at his camp.
- How do you--

38:52.207 --> 38:54.585
Someone had to fix the radio that I found.

38:54.585 --> 38:56.253
Left a mess of shavings behind.

39:00.048 --> 39:01.383
He made it out.

39:01.383 --> 39:02.634
He's alive.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.137
Thank you.

39:24.948 --> 39:29.912
No, no. Oh, goddamn it.

39:30.579 --> 39:31.580
Damn it.

39:42.716 --> 39:43.884
Colonel Shaw!

39:45.511 --> 39:47.262
It's an honor to finally meet you!
