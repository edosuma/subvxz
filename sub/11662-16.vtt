(serene music playing)

01:04.166 --> 01:05.166
Checkmate.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.400
Checkmate?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.133
I thought we were
playing yahtzee.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.300
Okay. That's a do-over.

01:13.367 --> 01:17.100
No. That is not a do-over.
You do this every time.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.066
Last time,
you thought it was checkers.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.533
Before that, it was battleship.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.367
And twice you yelled out
"snake eyes."

01:25.834 --> 01:27.133
No. That was for you.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.600
It was a mascara note.

01:34.834 --> 01:38.133
Anyway, the game's not over
till the fat lady sings.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.133
<i>♪ I'm singing in the rain ♪</i>
Hi, girls.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.533
You're in a good mood, Rose.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.467
Is someone expecting
her special visitor tonight?

01:50.533 --> 01:52.467
Oh, don't be silly, Blanche.

01:52.533 --> 01:55.066
I haven't had my special visitor
in years.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.066
Hey, neither have I.
It's amazing.

02:02.133 --> 02:04.433
When you live with women,
you get on the same cycle.

02:06.767 --> 02:09.867
I am talking about your date, Rose.

02:09.934 --> 02:12.033
Who is this secret man
you're seeing?

02:12.100 --> 02:15.066
His name's Ray.
He's a friend of Miles.

02:15.133 --> 02:17.800
You are dating a friend of Miles?

02:17.867 --> 02:20.467
-You scallywag.
-You skunkweed.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.233
What's that mean?

02:23.300 --> 02:25.500
I don't know.
What does yours mean?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.200
Girls, Ray and I aren't dating.

02:28.266 --> 02:30.100
Miles is in Europe
with some students,

02:30.166 --> 02:33.100
and I needed an escort for
the children's hospital fundraiser.

02:33.166 --> 02:36.200
Miles suggested I take Ray,
as a friend, that's all.

02:36.266 --> 02:38.133
Then you're missing
a prime opportunity.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.600
Going out with your
boyfriend's friend is very exciting.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.867
Take it from me.
I wrote the book on dating.

02:44.934 --> 02:46.767
Really? What's it called?

02:49.433 --> 02:51.500
It doesn't have a title,
you twit.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.300
Hi, oh. Sorry.
Well, good night.

02:57.367 --> 02:58.934
Oh, you're going
to bed already?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.600
What's so terrible
about going right to bed?

03:01.667 --> 03:05.266
Hey, Blanche, that's
a great title for your book.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.867
Rose was telling us about
this secret date tonight.

03:12.934 --> 03:14.700
What are you talking about?

03:14.767 --> 03:17.066
Rose has something
called a date, Dorothy.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.734
How can I explain this?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.200
You remember
when you went to a restaurant

03:22.266 --> 03:24.166
and a man pulled out your chair?

03:24.233 --> 03:26.834
If that had been a date,
he would have warned you first.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.633
I thought you were
going out with Stan.

03:31.700 --> 03:34.000
I am. I am.

03:34.066 --> 03:35.200
See you later.

03:35.266 --> 03:37.233
Oh, Blanche, favor.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.367
Dorothy, this has been
going on for months.

03:40.433 --> 03:43.000
"I have a date with Stan.
Can I borrow your bike?"

03:43.066 --> 03:47.066
He can't pick me up,
or my mother will hear the car.

03:47.133 --> 03:50.266
-Go on, honey. Take the bike.
-Thank you.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.600
-Dorothy.
-It's just around the block.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.533
-Dorothy.
-Oh, God.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.166
I hate what this does
to my hair.

04:00.133 --> 04:05.400
(mellow music playing)

04:05.467 --> 04:08.333
What's the matter?
A bad time with Ray?

04:08.400 --> 04:09.934
It wasn't Ray.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.033
His ex-wife Myra ran into the
Chowderhead's where we were eating

04:14.100 --> 04:15.767
and started yelling at me.

04:15.834 --> 04:17.734
She grabbed a lobster
out of the tank

04:17.800 --> 04:20.166
and forced me out of the booth.

04:21.967 --> 04:23.633
How was the lobster
at Chowderhead's?

04:23.700 --> 04:26.433
Scary.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.734
I don't know what to do.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.700
I tried to convince Myra he's just
a friend, but she wouldn't listen.

04:31.767 --> 04:34.033
For some reason,
she won't accept the divorce.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.834
I really feel threatened.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.667
Oh, please.
That's no threat.

04:37.734 --> 04:40.000
Where I come from, when someone
wanted to make a point,

04:40.066 --> 04:43.266
they'd tie string
around your finger.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.133
Come to think of it,
it wasn't string.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.367
It was a piano wire.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.333
Actually, it wasn't your finger.
It was your neck.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.767
Anyway, it was very popular.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.800
In fact, piano wire

04:55.867 --> 04:59.333
was our village's
second biggest export.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.100
Know what our biggest was?

05:01.166 --> 05:02.633
-No.
-No.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.066
Too bad.
I don't remember either.

05:06.133 --> 05:10.066
My God, I've left brain cells
all over the eastern seaboard.

05:12.233 --> 05:13.867
Rose. Psst. Psst.

05:13.934 --> 05:15.400
-Where's ma?
-Who?

05:15.467 --> 05:16.734
Where's ma?

05:16.800 --> 05:19.400
In the cemetery in St. Olaf.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.433
Why do you want to know?

05:22.500 --> 05:23.767
I thought we'd all go out

05:23.834 --> 05:26.133
and toilet paper
the Weston's' house.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.367
My ma.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.700
Don't worry.
She's gone to bed already.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.600
Well, did you have
a good time tonight?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.734
Oh, it was wonderful.

05:35.800 --> 05:41.333
Oh, girls, I cannot tell you how
nice it is to be with Stan lately.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.367
He's fun and attentive and sweet.

05:45.433 --> 05:47.667
Oh, even in the bedroom, he's just,

05:47.734 --> 05:52.400
well, he's really brought new
meaning to the word solicitous.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.300
What was the old
meaning again?

06:10.600 --> 06:13.200
So, Dorothy, do you love him?

06:13.266 --> 06:15.300
What does that mean, Blanche?

06:15.367 --> 06:18.767
He was my husband.
He was the father of my children.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.834
Of course, I have feelings for him.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.266
Well, what are they?

06:22.333 --> 06:24.867
Love.

06:24.934 --> 06:26.967
I guess I love him.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.767
I can't believe it.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.567
I don't love the fact
that he still keeps his toupee

06:31.633 --> 06:34.567
in the lettuce crisper.

06:34.633 --> 06:37.333
But it does look fresher,
and you deal with it.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.533
Dorothy, if you do love him,
tell your mother.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.033
She'll find out eventually.
Shouldn't it come from you?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.567
Oh, I guess so.

06:49.633 --> 06:51.633
That's settled.
Let's get a move on.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.000
Where are you going?

06:53.066 --> 06:55.633
To get the toilet paper
for the Weston's' house.

06:59.567 --> 07:02.533
But remember,
we have to be really quiet.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.533
Dreyfuss will bark at anything,
and Barbara carries a gun.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.900
Oh, what the hell.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.467
I understand, dear,
but we're not dating.

07:19.533 --> 07:22.200
Is that the woman who threatened
you with the lobster?

07:22.266 --> 07:23.934
Why are you talking to her?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.066
Well, she keeps calling,
what should I do?

07:26.133 --> 07:28.734
I'll get you off that phone.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.967
Rose,
I've fallen and I can't get up!

07:31.033 --> 07:32.500
Help me!

07:34.934 --> 07:38.300
I can't help you right now,
I'm on the phone.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.667
Myra. Myra, please.

07:48.734 --> 07:49.967
Who's on the phone?

07:50.033 --> 07:51.633
It's that woman
from the restaurant again.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.734
Give me the phone.

07:54.934 --> 07:57.166
So you're Myra?

07:57.233 --> 08:01.533
Who am I? Some call me Sophia,
others know me as the terminator.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.433
Of course, these people have corneas
that look like cotton balls.

08:07.934 --> 08:09.934
Maybe I'd better talk.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.100
Is that right? Well, listen, Myra,
I'm not afraid of you.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.000
I'm from Sicily.

08:14.066 --> 08:17.367
You know what the number one
export of our village is?

08:17.433 --> 08:18.767
Ransom notes.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.200
I had a flashback in the can.

08:28.533 --> 08:29.467
She hung up.

08:29.533 --> 08:32.467
Sure, she's not so tough
without her lobster.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.133
She must really be nuts
about that ex-husband.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.967
You have to be crazy to want
a relationship that badly.

08:41.033 --> 08:42.800
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.700
Relationships, Dorothy.
Human relationships.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.967
Remember when that guy asked you
to sleep over at his house?

08:50.033 --> 08:50.834
Yes.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.567
If that had been a relationship, you
would've been called a girlfriend.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.533
Instead of a dog sitter.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.500
Ma, I'm not proud of this, but...

09:06.834 --> 09:08.433
there's something
I have to show you.

09:13.633 --> 09:16.834
Oh, please. I've done a lot worse.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.867
I've done panties over pants...

09:21.233 --> 09:23.300
bras over blouses.

09:23.367 --> 09:25.734
Once I wore a shower cap
over my bonnet.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.400
No, Ma.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.867
I'm going out tonight...
with Stan.

09:32.367 --> 09:34.867
-No.
-Yes, Ma. I really am.

09:34.934 --> 09:36.700
I believe you. I said no.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.700
Ma, I've been seeing him
secretly for months now,

09:43.767 --> 09:45.133
and we're getting close.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.400
I see. So, what can I say?

09:48.467 --> 09:50.567
Do me one favor
on your way out.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.467
Will you back over me
with the car?

09:54.433 --> 09:56.100
I knew you'd take it well.

09:57.266 --> 10:00.100
Look, Ma, I'm going
to continue seeing Stan,

10:00.166 --> 10:03.467
and there's nothing you can do
to make me feel guilty.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.367
Where are you going?

10:05.433 --> 10:06.834
Chest pains.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.834
Ma, it's not
going to work!

10:11.900 --> 10:13.300
I don't feel guilty!

10:13.367 --> 10:15.500
-Dorothy!
-Nobody help her.

10:15.567 --> 10:18.133
We all know she's fine.
We know what she's doing.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.834
God, I hate that woman.
Ma!

10:23.700 --> 10:25.734
I have some news.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.767
I told my mother about us.

10:28.834 --> 10:29.734
How did she take it?

10:29.800 --> 10:31.000
Pretty well.

10:31.066 --> 10:32.433
Chest pains?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.100
You remember.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.934
Hey, you don't forget
your wedding day.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.066
Eat your potato.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.433
What?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.600
Oh, honey.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.967
I know it's an important
vegetable to you,

10:48.033 --> 10:50.333
but I'm really stuffed.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.200
Then stick your finger in it.

10:59.633 --> 11:01.200
Stan, you pig.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.967
Come on. I don't ask much.

11:05.033 --> 11:07.567
All right,
but we'll get you a hobby.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.700
There's something hard in here.

11:13.767 --> 11:18.033
It's a scalding hot ring!

11:22.533 --> 11:26.000
Oh, Stan, it's beautiful.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.467
And it's for you, Dorothy,
and it's for keeps.

11:30.533 --> 11:33.800
I'm through with the single life,
the bar scene--

11:33.867 --> 11:37.333
The puka shells. Oh, Stanley,
please say the puka shells.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.166
You're not leaving me
a whole lot of personality room.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.667
All right.
The puka shells.

11:44.734 --> 11:47.600
So, what I'm saying is...

11:51.433 --> 11:54.233
will you marry me, Dorothy?

11:54.300 --> 11:56.400
You know, again.

11:57.734 --> 12:01.266
Dorothy, these last few months
have been incredible,

12:01.333 --> 12:04.467
and after all the struggling,
we're finally into the good stuff.

12:04.533 --> 12:07.400
Let's share it.

12:07.467 --> 12:09.233
I don't know what to say.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.900
Don't you see?

12:10.967 --> 12:13.800
We belong together.
We're...

12:14.867 --> 12:19.166
an artful complement
of individual tastes,

12:19.233 --> 12:22.934
enhanced instead of
concealed by each other,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.900
and served in our natural juices.

12:29.533 --> 12:31.400
You got that from the menu.

12:35.967 --> 12:37.333
It was the special.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.734
Cajun prime rib.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.000
But I think it applies.

12:45.066 --> 12:46.467
Yes.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.033
-Yes?
-Yes, yes, yes, Stanley.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.333
I will marry you,
you know, again.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.333
I'm so happy. I feel lucky.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.000
I'm the lucky one.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.667
Dorothy Zbornak is going
to be my wife.

12:57.734 --> 13:00.266
I just want to tell the whole world.

13:00.333 --> 13:01.734
Me too.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.934
-But not your mother.
-But not my mother.

13:08.300 --> 13:13.367
(soft music playing)

13:13.433 --> 13:14.667
What you doing, Rose?

13:14.734 --> 13:17.533
Myra's been calling me at work
and threatening me,

13:17.600 --> 13:21.000
so I'm fixing a flashlight
so I can walk to my car at night

13:21.066 --> 13:23.433
in case she's planning
on surprising me.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.934
Good. Women should always
check their cars at night

13:27.000 --> 13:28.133
before they get in them.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.633
Blanche, that's a wonderful idea.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.333
I was just going to shine it
under my chin

13:33.400 --> 13:35.100
to make myself look scarier.

13:38.700 --> 13:42.033
I am really afraid.
I'm going to call the police.

13:42.100 --> 13:45.033
That's a good idea, honey.
Better safe than sorry.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.500
Girls... guess what
happened tonight.

13:48.567 --> 13:49.633
Give us a hint.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.500
The best thing that could happen
to a woman.

13:52.567 --> 13:55.500
The circus!
The circus is in town.

13:56.867 --> 13:59.100
No, no, Rose. No.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.433
It's about Stan.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.200
Well, I was close.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.433
Stan asked me to marry him.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.834
And?

14:07.900 --> 14:10.367
And... I accepted.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.967
Oh...
I don't know what to say.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.500
I sure as hell do. Group hug!

14:15.567 --> 14:16.900
Oh, honey.

14:16.967 --> 14:20.233
Dorothy, the ring. The ring.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.400
Oh, Dorothy, it's beautiful.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.000
Oh, are those baguettes?

14:25.066 --> 14:27.600
No. They're little pieces of potato.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.800
He hid the ring in the potato.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.934
-Oh...
-Ahh...

14:41.033 --> 14:44.066
Honey, if this is what you want,
we couldn't be happier.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.934
-It certainly is.
-Well, this is great.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.400
And you know what
we're going to do?

14:48.467 --> 14:51.867
We're going to have a big shower
and a beautiful wedding.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.567
It'll be wonderful.

14:53.633 --> 14:54.767
From here on in,

14:54.834 --> 14:58.600
I'm going to have to get used to
calling you Dorothy Zbornak.

15:02.467 --> 15:05.900
Rose, you've always called me
Dorothy Zbornak.

15:05.967 --> 15:08.100
I know, but I never really meant it.

15:12.633 --> 15:15.767
So, another tenant's meeting
I wasn't told about.

15:15.834 --> 15:19.500
What's the topic this time?
How to lose the old lady?

15:19.567 --> 15:21.967
No, Ma.
We're past the old business.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.433
We're into new business.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.567
Ma.

15:27.467 --> 15:30.333
Ma, Stan gave me
an engagement ring.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.166
I see. Excuse me.

15:44.934 --> 15:47.633
Ma, that's a microwave.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.700
I want to get this over with
as quickly as possible.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.667
Oh, Ma. I thought you'd
be happy for me.

15:54.734 --> 15:57.133
Stan has changed.
He's made a commitment.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.567
He's matured.

15:58.633 --> 16:02.266
Sophia, he put the ring in a potato.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.800
You're not helping, Rose.

16:09.867 --> 16:12.567
What happened to the
commitment he made last time?

16:12.633 --> 16:13.633
This one's different.

16:13.700 --> 16:14.934
This one is not different.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.200
He'll hurt you again.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.767
Promises mean nothing to him.

16:19.133 --> 16:20.400
You'll give the ring back.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.166
That's my final word.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.100
No. Excuse me. You'll pawn the ring.

16:26.166 --> 16:27.900
That's my final word.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.000
(serene music playing)

16:33.066 --> 16:36.400
"To keep Stan warm
on those cold winter nights,

16:36.467 --> 16:38.300
a head cozy."

16:41.433 --> 16:42.867
Lois, this is just too much.

16:42.934 --> 16:45.200
Where did you find
such a ridiculous thing?

16:45.266 --> 16:47.533
I make them myself.

16:49.367 --> 16:52.934
And it's the perfect color for Stan.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.300
Oh, Dorothy.
You crossed your legs.

16:55.367 --> 16:57.734
-You lose another sticker.
-Oh, Rose.

16:58.233 --> 17:01.867
Rose, these games of yours
are absolutely ridiculous.

17:01.934 --> 17:04.266
I can't think of anyone
with enough control

17:04.333 --> 17:06.767
to keep her legs apart
all the time.

17:13.934 --> 17:15.333
More chips?

17:17.467 --> 17:18.567
I just got off the phone.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.700
That stripper you called
is on his way over.

17:20.767 --> 17:22.967
I'll start another game
in the meantime.

17:23.033 --> 17:25.533
Pay attention. New game.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.200
-Oh...
-Oh...

17:27.266 --> 17:29.633
Oh, this is a
St. Olaf favorite.

17:29.700 --> 17:34.500
Everybody puts on a blindfold,
and then they choose a partner.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.000
Then they think of a number,

17:36.066 --> 17:38.400
and the other person
thinks of an object

17:38.467 --> 17:40.333
and then the bride
tags someone.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.900
They call out their number,
and then they switch with her.

17:43.967 --> 17:46.667
And so on and so on.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.467
And however many
switches there are,

17:50.533 --> 17:53.600
that's the number of children
the bride will have.

17:57.133 --> 17:59.000
And the numbers
have to add up

17:59.066 --> 18:01.133
and you can collect the objects.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.934
Okay. Put on your blindfold.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.700
Everybody wearing them?

18:06.767 --> 18:08.900
-Yeah.
-Yes.

18:10.834 --> 18:14.834
Okay. Spatula...11.

18:17.433 --> 18:18.633
Sorry to interrupt.

18:18.700 --> 18:22.567
I got a call from a Rose Nylund.

18:22.633 --> 18:25.834
My God, you are just perfect.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.967
Now, look,
that is her right there.

18:28.033 --> 18:32.400
She doesn't suspect a thing.
Have you got your handcuffs?

18:32.467 --> 18:33.567
Well, yes.

18:33.633 --> 18:34.533
Okay, great.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.700
Look, when I give you
one of these...

18:36.767 --> 18:38.033
Hey, aah!

18:39.533 --> 18:41.533
You go into your dance.
You got it?

18:41.600 --> 18:42.867
Listen, I think there's--

18:42.934 --> 18:46.533
Oh, my goodness, everybody,
just look who's here.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.000
Why, we must have
the music up too loud.

18:49.066 --> 18:50.633
I'll turn it down.

18:51.166 --> 18:53.166
("The Stripper" plays)

18:55.567 --> 18:57.600
There's your criminal.

18:57.667 --> 19:00.734
Prosecute her
to the utmost of the law.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.266
Hello!

19:02.333 --> 19:03.800
Blanche.

19:03.867 --> 19:05.500
Can you believe this?

19:05.567 --> 19:07.200
The stripper's here
and we're missing it

19:07.266 --> 19:09.533
because of these
stupid blindfolds.

19:11.333 --> 19:15.100
Okay, Furillo, drop your pants.

19:15.166 --> 19:18.367
It's time for a little
search and seizure.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.967
Touch me again,
and you're going to prison.

19:22.033 --> 19:24.133
Honk-honk!

19:25.533 --> 19:26.834
Blanche.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.200
Blanche, we have company.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.233
This means you're a real cop?

19:41.300 --> 19:42.667
Yes, ma'am.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.400
The name is... Devereaux.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.400
Blanche Devereaux.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.800
Woo-woo!

19:56.300 --> 19:58.934
Sophia, honey, you really ought
to go out on the lanai,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.333
-you're missing quite a shower.
-I'm not missing anything.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.400
Where I'm from, the marriages
are arranged by the parents.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.567
Is that what's bothering you,
Sophia?

20:07.633 --> 20:09.000
Nobody asked your permission?

20:09.066 --> 20:10.834
It's the Italian tradition.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.967
What do you think
fiddler on the roof was about?

20:15.800 --> 20:18.100
That's a Jewish musical.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.166
What do you mean "Jewish"?

20:19.233 --> 20:23.367
I remember there was
Enzo Stuarti, Dom Deluise.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.367
Boy, I gotta stop seeing these
things at dinner theatres.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.500
How's it going out there?

20:32.567 --> 20:34.233
The stripper used to be a cop,

20:34.300 --> 20:36.233
and the cop always wanted
to be a dancer.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.600
Now they're wearing
each other's hats,

20:37.667 --> 20:39.367
and it's really getting weird.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.033
Ma still won't join us?

20:43.100 --> 20:44.433
She's still upset.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.233
I cannot believe that
she's this stubborn.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.066
Maybe you should take
a different approach,

20:50.133 --> 20:51.567
a more traditional one.

20:51.633 --> 20:52.367
Like...

20:52.433 --> 20:55.867
I don't know.
Like set up a meeting

20:55.934 --> 20:58.000
and have Stan
ask for your hand...

20:58.066 --> 20:59.667
in an Italian sort of way.

20:59.734 --> 21:03.667
You want me to go in, bow
my head, and kiss her ring?

21:03.734 --> 21:05.934
You know, that just might work.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.533
I mean, she thinks of herself
as the Godfather.

21:10.233 --> 21:12.800
I'll just make her an offer
that she can't remember.

21:13.867 --> 21:18.533
(mellow music playing)

21:19.400 --> 21:21.600
Sophia, thank you for coming.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.266
I want you to know
how grateful we are

21:30.333 --> 21:32.100
you're seeing us at this time.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.967
Have I sat down yet?

21:34.033 --> 21:35.333
I'm sorry.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.600
No. I mean, am I this short?

21:38.667 --> 21:40.900
You two are like
a couple of redwoods.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.333
So, as is tradition,

21:48.400 --> 21:51.000
I'm ready to accept your
gifts and offerings.

21:51.066 --> 21:52.567
You may begin, Dorothy.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.367
I appreciate your
sense of ritual, Ma,

21:57.433 --> 22:02.033
but just so you know, I still have
Shady Pines on the speed dial.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.834
Moving on.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.000
What do you want, Stan?

22:07.066 --> 22:09.133
Stan wants to talk
about the wedding.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.200
Are you Stan?
Am I talking to you?

22:11.700 --> 22:13.767
I'm Stan, Sophia. Over here.

22:15.367 --> 22:18.633
Sorry. I thought it was another
"am I sitting" question.

22:19.734 --> 22:22.100
Anyway, Sophia,
it occurred to me

22:22.166 --> 22:24.233
that I never actually
asked your permission

22:24.300 --> 22:25.734
to marry your daughter.

22:25.800 --> 22:29.800
I guess in asking her hand,
I'm also asking your hand.

22:29.867 --> 22:31.867
So, what do you say?

22:31.934 --> 22:33.867
Will you be my mother-in-law?

22:33.934 --> 22:37.100
Marrying us both, eh?

22:37.166 --> 22:43.133
So, I suppose one could say
six years ago you left us both.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.333
Of course, that was after you spent
the entire marriage

22:45.400 --> 22:47.834
cheating on us both.

22:47.900 --> 22:52.000
The only difference is, you haven't
been forgiven by us both.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.767
So the answer is no.

22:54.266 --> 22:56.300
I don't trust you, Stan.

22:56.967 --> 23:00.800
And where there's no trust,
there's no family.

23:00.867 --> 23:03.900
You marry this man,
and we're no longer family.

23:04.867 --> 23:08.934
You do this...
you are out of my life forever.

23:22.967 --> 23:29.033
(theme music playing)
