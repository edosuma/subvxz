Right.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.539
She comes on December 23rd,
the Eve of Christmas Eve...

21:15.541 --> 21:16.807

21:16.809 --> 21:19.076

21:19.078 --> 21:20.945

21:20.947 --> 21:23.814

a truck and use that every year?

21:23.816 --> 21:25.383
Wouldn't that make more sense?

21:25.385 --> 21:27.251

21:27.253 --> 21:29.520
