WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.504
Donna.

00:03.571 --> 00:06.107
Where's the Icy Hot?
My shoulder's jacked.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.708
( Sighs )

00:07.775 --> 00:09.643
Oh. Never mind.
I got it.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.445
( Sighs )

00:12.946 --> 00:14.848
There we go.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.351
( Grunting )

00:17.418 --> 00:19.153
( Groans )
Get in there.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.797
Fire in the pit.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.634
I got fire in the pit!

00:35.436 --> 00:36.937
Aah!

00:37.004 --> 00:38.106
Ride it out.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.375
Aah!

00:41.442 --> 00:42.843
( Groans )

00:44.712 --> 00:46.747
Aah.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.048
Ohh.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.250
Whew.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.153
( Grunts )

00:52.220 --> 00:54.588
Ooh.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.357
Aah!

00:57.591 --> 00:59.093
Hot.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.061
Donna. Hey.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.264
Donna.
Hmm?

01:03.331 --> 01:04.498
You got to help me.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.301
Switch sides.
My shoulder is killing me.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.569
Just roll over.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.404
I can't. I've slept this way
for 20 years.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.840
Please stop talking.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.409
Okay.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.077
( Grunts )

01:17.145 --> 01:18.846
( Sighs )
There we go.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.971
( Sighs )

01:53.481 --> 01:54.748
Ow!

01:55.949 --> 01:57.351
What?!

01:57.418 --> 01:58.786
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?!

01:58.852 --> 02:00.154
My shoulder's hurt.
I can't sleep.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.223
-So you throw a book at me?!
-No.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.524
I was just -- I was trying
to build a wall.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.393
What? Why?

02:05.459 --> 02:08.396
I didn't expect
to see your face like that.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.863
Like what?

02:09.930 --> 02:12.666
Nothing.
It's just your, uh...

02:12.733 --> 02:14.001
Your sleepy face
is just a little --

02:14.067 --> 02:17.805
Uh, it's just
a little disconcerting.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.573
So you're saying
I'm ugly?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.242
No. No.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.543
I'm just saying...

02:22.610 --> 02:23.844
you're an ugly sleeper,
you know.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.045
Hmm.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.247
But conscious,
you're a 10.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.682
I mean,
I didn't even know --

02:28.749 --> 02:30.884
You're way out of my league
now, when you're awake.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.020
Whatever.
Good night.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.727
Could you do me a solid
and face the other way?

02:39.793 --> 02:41.529
Seriously?

02:41.595 --> 02:43.297
-It's just --
-No. This is how I sleep.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.832
All right, then,
can we switch sides

02:44.898 --> 02:46.033
and I'll look
at the closet

02:46.099 --> 02:47.301
and you can be back
behind me

02:47.368 --> 02:48.936
making all the zombie faces
you want?

02:50.070 --> 02:51.305
( Scoffs )

02:51.372 --> 02:53.207
Unbelievable.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.843
( Sighs )

02:55.909 --> 02:58.011
-I really appreciate it.
-Such a baby!

03:02.049 --> 03:05.419
( Groans )

03:05.486 --> 03:10.324
So, I'll just rest
in this gully
you've carved out.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.160
It's like sleeping
in a fat canoe.

03:15.729 --> 03:20.668
* I am not your ordinary guy

03:20.734 --> 03:22.370
Wow.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.305
Never knew you had
such a great view of the TV

03:24.372 --> 03:25.506
from your side of the bed.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.942
There's no glare.
Sound really comes alive.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.578
Okay, well,
don't get used to it,

03:30.644 --> 03:33.347
because soon as
your shoulder's better,
we're switching back.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.924
You know
it's like five steps

03:43.991 --> 03:46.527
from your side of the bed
to the bathroom?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.496
It's like a step and a half
from the closet.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.266
All right. Well, I will
update my records.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.802
Where's my lip balm?

03:54.868 --> 03:57.271
It's gotta be like 30 steps
from my side.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.407
That's a massive time-saver
for you.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.074
Okay, well,
sweetie, please,

04:01.141 --> 04:02.410
just write down everything,
all right --

04:02.476 --> 04:03.877
how many steps it is
from here to the kitchen,

04:03.944 --> 04:05.479
here to your friend's house --
whatever you want.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.881
And I promise,
when I get back,
we'll talk about it, okay?

04:07.948 --> 04:09.450
You don't really mean that,
do you?

04:09.517 --> 04:10.651
I don't.
Love you.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.454
**

04:13.521 --> 04:15.889
Man: This week's
Iron Vegan Challenge

04:15.956 --> 04:17.591
was exceptionally difficult.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.661
Each of you very talented
chefs were tasked

04:20.728 --> 04:22.730
with making a vegan fondue

04:22.796 --> 04:25.499
with nothing but chickpeas,
curried lentils,

04:25.566 --> 04:29.169
and water from the Dead Sea.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.271
Renee, the judges have spoken,

04:31.339 --> 04:36.577
and they find your fondue
to be more of a fon-don't.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.313
Take your knives and leave
the kitchen immediately.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.282
( Sobbing )

04:50.558 --> 04:52.225
Is Chale crying
at a cooking show?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.327
Shh!

04:53.394 --> 04:54.495
Mom.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.596
Jack, stop it.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.697
Hey, you said

04:56.764 --> 04:59.500
if we see something,
say something.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.001
That was weird.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.135
It was.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.504
Okay, look.
show's over.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.739
It's bedtime, anyway.
Let's go.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.808
( Sniffles )

05:09.710 --> 05:12.179
Babe. You were crying
pretty good there.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.716
Renee getting eliminated
caught me off-guard.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.288
Did you see that?

05:21.355 --> 05:22.923
Oh, honey.
It was kind of hard not to.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.057
Now, is there any --

05:24.124 --> 05:26.827
( Chuckles, sighs )

05:28.962 --> 05:31.965
( Cries )
I need a minute.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.037
Is there a chance that maybe
a member of his family

05:37.104 --> 05:38.872
was killed
on a cooking show?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.410
I wish.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.379
I mean, I love him so much,
and I'm going to marry him,

05:45.446 --> 05:46.547
but is it bad that I want

05:46.614 --> 05:48.449
to dial down his emotions
a little bit?

05:48.516 --> 05:51.351
Well, it's not wrong, honey.
It's just impossible.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.086
You can't change people,
you know?

05:53.153 --> 05:57.591
If you could,
your father wouldn't
have lucky sweatpants.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.826
Yeah, I just think

05:58.892 --> 06:00.694
with him moving down here
and living with us,

06:00.761 --> 06:02.996
you know, he doesn't have
any guy friends anymore.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.399
Oh! Maybe he could hang out
with Dad and his buddies.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.900
Ooh, honey, no.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.738
That's just throwing Chale
into a piranha tank.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.007
All that'd be left are bones
and his little glasses.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.677
Mom,
I have to do something.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.712
Okay, and I hear you,
but could we deal
with it tomorrow?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.481
I gotta go rotate
our mattress.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.183
That memory foam can't seem
to forget your father.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.820
**

06:26.887 --> 06:30.057
3, 4, 5 steps
from her side of the bed,

06:30.123 --> 06:33.360
and boom --
she's hitting porcelain.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.862
So, you're, like,
twice as far away.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.565
It's more than that.
It's like a marathon.

06:37.631 --> 06:41.234
Halfway to the bathroom,
I'm getting passed
by a Kenyan.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.604
I'm guessing people
from a lot of countries
are passing you.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.372
( Chuckles )

06:45.439 --> 06:48.375
Easy, guy. I don't see
your shirt coming off
in the pool, either.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.480
Anyway, she took over
the bedroom,

06:52.546 --> 06:53.781
and forget the bathroom.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.148
Her sink space
is like this.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.884
Mine -- right there.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.852
Okay, bad news, guy.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.921
It's not just the bedroom
and the bathroom.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.723
Donna's changed up
the whole house.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.291
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.358
Oh, am I?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.827
I've been divorced
three times, pal.

07:06.894 --> 07:07.961
I know women.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.663
You don't believe me?

07:09.730 --> 07:11.198
That's your favorite chair,
right?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.600
Let me ask you
one simple question.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.934
Does it recline
like the old one?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.469
It goes with everything else
in the room.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.804
Right, right.
But does it recline?

07:16.870 --> 07:18.539
It was a floor model.
We got 10% off it.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.041
I understand.
Does it recline?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.810
We got free delivery,
you know.
Does it recline?!

07:22.876 --> 07:26.647
No, it doesn't recline!
I hate this chair!

07:28.549 --> 07:29.783
All right,
fan out, boys.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.519
Let's take inventory
of everything she did.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.753
All right?
This ends now.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.454
Let's go.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.524
I'm guessing
this juicer ain't yours.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.726
Prime location,
right near an outlet.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.595
That's where my George Foreman
grill used to be.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.996
I loved that thing.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.998
Bad news on the DVR.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.534
-What's up?
-You don't want to know.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.635
Hit me!

07:47.701 --> 07:49.737
"Say Yes to the Dress,"
14 episodes --

07:49.803 --> 07:51.572
some of them repeats.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.041
Wow, yeah,
I'm telling you, man,

07:54.107 --> 07:55.876
this --
this is not good.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.878
Well, hey,
we just retired.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.346
We're gonna start
seeing things.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.914
I just found out

08:00.981 --> 08:03.216
the stray cat that's been
hanging around
outside our house

08:03.283 --> 08:04.718
is actually our cat.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.922
You got one hot sauce in here,
and it's way in the back.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.290
This whole fridge
is a joke.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.559
Okay, you know what?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.193
Just shut the door,
all right?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.596
I'm getting a blast
of cold air on the back
of my neck, and --

08:15.663 --> 08:18.732
Wait a second. That's why
she had me sit here.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.501
She told me
it was the head of the table.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.336
It's a round table,
guy.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.439
A-And look at this.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.942
Her coffee mug,
right in the place of honor.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.544
And mine,
it's way up he--

08:30.611 --> 08:32.546
( Groans )

08:32.613 --> 08:34.682
Wait a second.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.416
That's how
I hurt my shoulder.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.586
Go -- Aah.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.653
Aah!

08:39.720 --> 08:40.821
Okay,
whatever you're doing...

08:40.888 --> 08:41.922
Aah! I got it!

08:41.989 --> 08:43.256
...I'd stop.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.359
Duff, just do me a favor.
Get me an ice pack.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.761
No can do.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.163
All you got is
Brussels sprouts
and frozen yogurt.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.700
It's like
you don't even exist.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.934
**

08:55.869 --> 08:56.937
**

08:57.004 --> 08:58.205
Hey, babe.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.306
What's up?

08:59.372 --> 09:02.843
I'll tell you what's up --
the jig.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.845
The jig?

09:04.912 --> 09:07.748
That's right.
It's up.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.516
You almost got away
with it, too.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.651
What are you
talking about?

09:10.718 --> 09:12.485
This house
and everything in it,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.421
and how it's all
for your benefit.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.423
Let's start
with your coffee mug, huh?

09:16.489 --> 09:19.526
Yours is right here,
next to the coffee maker.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.062
And mine --
way up in Bursitis County!

09:23.797 --> 09:25.999
That is how
I hurt my shoulder.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.668
No,
you hurt your shoulder

09:27.735 --> 09:30.938
doing a cartwheel
at the bowling alley.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.172
That was not my shoulder.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.375
That was my ankle,
because I stuck the landing.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.979
Let me ask you
a couple questions.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.281
Where's my
George Foreman grill,
and where's my recliner?

09:41.348 --> 09:42.582
Probably up in the attic,

09:42.650 --> 09:44.117
with all the other stuff
you bought and don't use.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.019
Oh, you got an answer
for everything, don't you?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.389
And this refrigerator
is a joke.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.691
Oh, now you're mad
at the fridge?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.760
Yeah. You know what?
You feel that?

09:52.826 --> 09:53.827
Do you feel that?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.929
All that cold air
that hits my neck

09:55.996 --> 09:57.831
when I'm in the chair
that you made me sit at.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.032
-What?!
-Yeah.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.169
You begged to sit
in this chair, remember?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.737
You wanted your back
to the microwave

10:03.804 --> 10:05.806
so you could be surprised
by the ding.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.842
You chose this seat.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.043
Did I?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.645
Who really chooses --
the person who chooses

10:11.712 --> 10:14.581
or the person who creates
the illusion of choice?

10:15.415 --> 10:16.516
The person who chooses.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.386
Are you saying
that I somehow

10:19.452 --> 10:21.254
Jedi mind-tricked you
into all this?

10:21.321 --> 10:23.691
Look, I don't know
what techniques
you use or don't use.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.625
Okay, sweetheart,
obviously, you are upset.

10:25.693 --> 10:26.894
No, no, no, no.
Okay?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.528
Upset is when you find
a little black French fry

10:28.595 --> 10:30.163
in your box of onion rings,
okay?

10:31.899 --> 10:34.567
I am beyond,
and I'm making changes now.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.870
If I want a beanbag chair
in the bathroom,

10:36.937 --> 10:40.941
I'm getting a beanbag chair
in the bathroom.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.209
No.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.546
Babe, this house,
it works, okay?

10:46.613 --> 10:47.781
It's like
a beautiful old sweater

10:47.848 --> 10:49.082
that I have been knitting
for years.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.284
Please don't come in
and start pulling threads.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.452
This isn't working for me.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.754
And I hear you,
all right?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.255
But don't get mad at me

10:55.322 --> 10:56.656
for decisions
that were already made.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.692
I can't go back in time
and change them.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.493
But you are right,
all right?

11:00.560 --> 11:01.729
You should be
making decisions.

11:01.795 --> 11:02.863
Thank you.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.531
Okay, so let's make a deal,
okay?

11:04.597 --> 11:05.766
From this moment on,

11:05.833 --> 11:08.802
you and I have to agree
on everything.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.437
That's all
I've been trying to say.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.239
And I'm moving my mug right
over by the coffee maker.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.674
Okay, fine.
You win. You win.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.944
All right?
We are copacetic.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.212
Yeah. Copacetic.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.914
Great.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.416
I'm gonna go get caught up
on "Say Yes to the Dress."

11:25.252 --> 11:27.921
And I'm gonna look up
the word "copacetic."

11:27.988 --> 11:31.058
**

11:31.124 --> 11:33.360
So, I put the hammer down,
you know?

11:33.426 --> 11:34.728
She gave me
some dance-around

11:34.795 --> 11:36.897
about a fuzzy sweater
and all that.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.366
And I told her, "Hey.
No mas." You know?

11:40.768 --> 11:43.636
Anyway,
we're copacetic now.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.072
So, let me
get this straight.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.674
She let you move
one coffee cup
and you're happy?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.376
Not happy --
copacetic.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.345
And bonus --

11:52.412 --> 11:54.347
anything we want to change
in the future,

11:54.414 --> 11:55.783
we both got to agree on.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.684
It's a total victory.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.152
What are you
talking about, guy?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.954
You just argued your way
back to status quo.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.390
No, I'm telling you, I-I won.
She even said, "You win."

12:04.992 --> 12:06.593
She lollipopped you.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.428
What?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.463
Yeah.
It's like with my kids.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.065
Whenever they want
something big,

12:12.132 --> 12:13.633
I give them a lollipop,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.969
and they forget
about the big thing.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.873
So, his lollipop...

12:19.940 --> 12:22.042
is your coffee cup.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.445
Yeah, I did the math,
Chewbacca.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.447
**

12:30.583 --> 12:32.820
Hey, Uncle Kyle,
thanks again for doing this.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.288
And please don't say
anything to Chale
about what we're doing,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.090
'cause it would
really hurt his feelings.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.725
Gotcha.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.828
A couple of tatted-up
Brazilians fighting in a cage,

12:40.894 --> 12:42.195
some beers --
( Chuckles )

12:42.262 --> 12:44.431
We're gonna have your guy
manned up in about an hour.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.667
Give me a weekend,

12:47.734 --> 12:50.804
I'll kill every emotion
he's got.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.873
No, no. Just your basic
manning-up package.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.774
We don't need him dead
behind the eyes.

12:54.842 --> 12:58.278
All right!
Let's prepare to tussle!

12:59.947 --> 13:01.514
Okay, I've got some studying
to do,

13:01.581 --> 13:02.983
so I'm gonna
go grab my books.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.584
You have chips, some beer,

13:04.651 --> 13:06.519
so enjoy the whup-ass!

13:09.089 --> 13:10.924
What's up, bud?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.359
Oh, this fight's
gonna be great.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.094
This guy Novack
is an animal.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.228
Ooh.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.563
He once bit off
a guy's ear.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.698
The ref put it on ice
so they could reattach it.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.933
( Laughs )

13:20.000 --> 13:21.534
I mean, he can wear glasses
and stuff,

13:21.601 --> 13:23.470
but they just don't sit right
on his face.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.671
Here we go!

13:24.737 --> 13:25.839
Announcer:
Before this next fight starts,

13:25.906 --> 13:28.741
a bittersweet backstory
on Vladi Novack.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.045
He grew up in a refugee camp
in war-torn Croatia

13:32.112 --> 13:34.547
where his only friend
was his grandmother.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.748
He vowed to give her

13:35.815 --> 13:37.384
a better life
in the United States.

13:37.450 --> 13:40.921
Sadly, undiagnosed diabetes
claimed her life

13:40.988 --> 13:43.556
within hours
of arriving in New York

13:43.623 --> 13:45.358
before she could ever see

13:45.425 --> 13:48.728
the beautiful new home
Novack bought for her.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.899
Novack has dedicated
this fight to all
the grandmothers

13:51.965 --> 13:54.801
sitting in refugee camps
around the world tonight.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.137
Okay, what happened?!
I was gone for two minutes.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.839
( Voice breaking ) He bought
his sick grandmother a house.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.011
( Voice breaking )
And she never got to see it.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.146
**

14:09.249 --> 14:11.251
Hey, ki-- ids.
Hey, Mom.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.720
You want
a grilled cheese waffle?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.923
Um...n-no, thank you.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.457
Where'd this chair
come from?

14:17.524 --> 14:20.060
Dad did it.
It's awesome, right?

14:22.095 --> 14:24.564
There's a beanbag chair
in the bathroom.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.499
Also awesome!

14:31.972 --> 14:33.740
( Scoffs )

14:33.806 --> 14:36.076
Whoa. Buzzkill.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.344
Hey.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.246
I saw the recliner
in the kitchen.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.614
That's classy.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.815
What is that smell?

14:42.882 --> 14:43.917
My candle.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.018
It smells like meatloaf.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.219
'Cause
it's a meatloaf candle.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.554
Ew!

14:49.256 --> 14:50.757
And what are you wearing?

14:50.823 --> 14:51.858
Well, I was
up in the attic,

14:51.925 --> 14:53.660
and I found
my leg-compression pants

14:53.726 --> 14:55.428
that give me
a spa-quality massage.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.031
And my ab-shocker --
found this.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.268
Yeah. Six-pack abs
with ab-solutely no exercise.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.702
( Sighing ) Ohh.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.071
You're kidding me.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.172
I'm not kidding you,

15:05.238 --> 15:07.340
and I'm starting my workout
right now.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.977
( Grunts ) Ooh.
Honey.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.578
I thought that we had
an agreement

15:11.644 --> 15:14.881
that we were going to discuss
things like this.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.683
Let's talk about it.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.051
Ooh.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.821
While I lay back here,

15:21.888 --> 15:23.156
get a little ab workout,

15:23.223 --> 15:27.294
and watch the latest
Jason Bourne * DVD

15:27.360 --> 15:31.298
Well, you sound like
an iiidiot.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.465
Turn that thing off.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.534
Okay.
I'm turning it off.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.303
Not because
you told me to --

15:36.369 --> 15:38.805
because my workout's over,
anyway.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.173
Abs feel like
they're popping.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.741
Can you see them
through the shirt?

15:41.808 --> 15:43.576
You catching them?

15:45.645 --> 15:46.980
Where's the TV?

15:47.047 --> 15:48.581
Oh.
It's right over there.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.117
Mm.
Follow the thumb.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.184
Yeah.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.221
Oh!

15:54.287 --> 15:56.089
TV on the ceiling!
Yeah.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.490
That's ridiculous!

15:57.557 --> 15:59.626
Why don't you just staple
some magazines up there, too,

15:59.692 --> 16:02.429
and we can both read
without using our arms?

16:02.495 --> 16:03.596
Tell you what --
I'll consider it,

16:03.663 --> 16:05.498
but how are we gonna
turn the pages?

16:06.433 --> 16:07.867
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:07.934 --> 16:09.602
it's time to improve
the circulation

16:09.669 --> 16:10.970
in my walking sticks.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.074
( Whirring )
Here we go.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.176
I know you think
you're being cute,

16:16.243 --> 16:18.945
but all of this is going
back to the attic.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.982
Sorry, I can't hear ya!
Got leg bags inflatin'.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.951
Hope it's copacetic.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.520
( Sighs )

16:27.587 --> 16:30.590
Man, that feels good.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.192
Wow.
That got tight quick.

16:33.926 --> 16:34.994
Ohh.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.129
Oh, come on.
Get lower, man.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.230
Aah.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.531
Hey, Donna!

16:38.598 --> 16:39.666
Aah!

16:39.732 --> 16:40.833
Donna!

16:40.900 --> 16:41.934
( Groans )

16:42.001 --> 16:43.036
Hey, Donna!

16:43.103 --> 16:44.437
Ohh!

16:44.504 --> 16:46.106
Aah!

16:52.279 --> 16:53.913
Ohh!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.518
Donna! Donna!

16:58.585 --> 17:00.687
Donna!
What the hell?!

17:00.753 --> 17:03.356
Unplug my pants!
Unplug my pants!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.259
( Air hisses )
Okay.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.361
That's not working!
They're still compressing!

17:08.428 --> 17:10.330
Cut 'em off me!
Cut 'em off me!
All right.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.398
Okay.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.765
Cut 'em off me!
Okay. Okay.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.467
Hold on a second.
Careful with that.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.535
( Groans )

17:15.602 --> 17:17.604
( Air hissing )
Aah! Oh!

17:17.670 --> 17:20.473
Aah! Ohh.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.774
Aah. Ohh.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.910
Okay.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.044
( Sighs )

17:25.112 --> 17:26.179
Are you okay?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.380
Yeah.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.584
Ohh.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.453
( Exhales sharply )

17:33.520 --> 17:35.388
Now I remember why
I stopped using these things.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.790
They're crazy-dangerous.
Mm.

17:37.857 --> 17:43.530
So, obviously, this is not
just about making decisions.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.064
What's going on?

17:45.132 --> 17:47.434
( Sighs )

17:47.500 --> 17:49.169
I'm -- I'm
the George Foreman grill.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.237
There you go.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.904
What are you
talking about?

17:51.971 --> 17:53.072
I just looked
around the house

17:53.140 --> 17:55.375
at all this stuff
that I wasn't a part of,

17:55.442 --> 17:56.676
and...I don't know.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.511
I felt like I was somebody
who was just, like,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.281
shoved up in the attic
with all this other junk.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.316
I feel like
I don't matter.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.718
Oh, honey, no.
You matter.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.287
And I'm sorry
if I did anything

18:07.354 --> 18:10.390
to make you feel
like you didn't.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.392
You know, maybe I did

18:12.459 --> 18:15.094
subconsciously
do some stuff for me,

18:15.162 --> 18:17.230
but my intention was always
just to make this

18:17.297 --> 18:18.631
a big, happy house
for all of us.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.700
And you did an amazing job,
all right?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.735
It's just --
I'm home now.

18:22.802 --> 18:23.836
Yeah.
You know?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.605
And I have ideas, too.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.876
I just need you to trust
that my ideas --

18:41.954 --> 18:43.656
...my ideas are valid.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.096
All this stuff
is going back.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.864
Not my meatloaf candle.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.303
Fine.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.105
Total victory.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.773
**

19:04.844 --> 19:06.713
( Dog whimpering )

19:06.779 --> 19:09.048
( Somber music playing )

19:12.552 --> 19:14.721
( Sniffling )

19:25.365 --> 19:27.334
Hey,
what's going on with you?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.501
Nothing.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.270
Good movie.
Glad I picked it.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.807
Dog's having
a rough day.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.544
But this is really sad.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.878
I mean,
the dog is dying,

19:38.945 --> 19:41.381
and the kitten
just went over a waterfall.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.682
Nothing?

19:42.749 --> 19:46.686
Your Uncle Kyle
told me your little plan.

19:46.753 --> 19:50.457
Apparently, you want
an emotionless dreamboat.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.660
Well...you got him.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.734
Okay, Chale, look,
I made a huge mistake.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.636
I-I shouldn't have tried
to change you.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.039
Just be who you are,
because...I love that person.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.375
Really?

20:08.441 --> 20:10.009
Yeah.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.278
Okay, good.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.880
Because when the kitten
went over the waterfall,

20:13.946 --> 20:15.815
(Sobbing)
he had his little...

20:17.317 --> 20:19.719
It was just --
it was too much.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.521
You okay (Sobs) with this?

20:22.789 --> 20:23.923
More or less.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.058
Oh, thank you.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.060
( Sobbing )

20:28.127 --> 20:29.462
Oh.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.398
I'm sorry
it didn't work out, Chale.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.268
If it's any consolation,

20:35.335 --> 20:38.271
I'll pay for your flight
back to England.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.872
Dad,
we're not breaking up.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.574
Offer still stands.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.943
**

20:44.010 --> 20:47.314
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:47.380 --> 20:50.850
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:50.917 --> 20:53.052
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:53.119 --> 20:54.587
* Do, do, do, do

20:54.654 --> 20:58.257
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:58.325 --> 21:01.328
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:01.394 --> 21:03.963
* I just don't want no...
