“The Disciples of the Ram."

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:03.549
Let's just say that I've had one
or two experiences in my life...

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:07.390
...that have helped me
to keep an open mind.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:19.906
I don't particularly think what you're
experiencing is the ghost of that girl.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.033
Why not?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.445
Well, ghosts haunt specific places.

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.455
Usually where something terrible
has happened.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.366

But we moved and it's still happening.

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:35.505
Which is why I don't think it's a ghost.

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.586

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:41.128
You said that they were
trying to summon something.

they don't summon ghosts.
