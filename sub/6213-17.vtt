WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.071
Hey, your favorite college
girl's coming to see you.

00:04.071 --> 00:05.339
Felicity's here?

00:07.107 --> 00:08.609
I just came
to get my tennis racket.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.443
Josh and I
are going to go play.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.078
I didn't know you
still played tennis.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.579
Well, I haven't done it
in a while

00:12.579 --> 00:14.915
but I figure I'll get right back
in the swing of it.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.083
Oh, look...

00:16.083 --> 00:18.352
it's a letter from
your cousin Amanda's
school.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.620
And it's marked "urgent."

00:19.620 --> 00:22.189
No sense in opening
all our mail in one day.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.725
Hey, Amanda's not as bad
as she used to be.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.260
Besides, maybe our school

00:26.260 --> 00:28.228
is giving her an award
or something.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.496
No award.

00:29.496 --> 00:30.931
But I was first in my class

00:30.931 --> 00:32.399
to mail myself first class.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.667
Next time, you
might want to try

00:33.667 --> 00:35.065
getting all the stamps
on the envelope.

00:35.065 --> 00:35.402
Ow.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.738
Just out of curiosity
are you doing here

00:37.738 --> 00:38.906
in the middle of
a school week?

00:38.906 --> 00:41.108
I need help studying
for my witches license.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.443
If I flunk this test
I'll lose my magic powers.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.745
<i>Please</i> will you help me?

00:44.745 --> 00:47.047
Okay. We'd be happy
to tutor you.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.350
But be forewarned,
our witches training program

00:50.350 --> 00:51.518
is very intense.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.020
Yes. Their lessons
on hex education

00:53.020 --> 00:54.221
are not for the squeamish.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.389
That's because we're
very thorough.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.390
We made sure
that Sabrina knew

00:56.390 --> 00:58.992
that the exact angle when
pointing is 45 degrees.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.894
Actually, it's 47.

01:00.894 --> 01:01.828
No, it's 45.

01:01.828 --> 01:02.896
47.
45.

01:02.896 --> 01:03.897
Let's call it 46.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.566
Better yet, let's call it a day.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.034
Got to go.

01:10.904 --> 01:17.110
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:17.110 --> 01:23.517
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:23.517 --> 01:26.587
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:26.687 --> 01:30.691
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:32.859 --> 01:36.363
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:36.363 --> 01:40.601
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:47.674 --> 01:48.742
Okay, deuce.

01:49.209 --> 01:51.011
( <i>music playing</i> )

01:51.578 --> 01:52.746
Whoo!

01:53.013 --> 01:53.914
Oh!

01:58.685 --> 01:59.720
Oh!

01:59.720 --> 02:01.955
That's set. 6-3.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.956
That was great.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.458
We really play well together.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.827
Actually, the custom
is to shake

02:06.827 --> 02:08.028
then kiss.

02:08.028 --> 02:11.298
Oh, right, like Agassi and
Sampras at the French Open.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.434
That was so much fun.

02:14.434 --> 02:15.869
Let's play again tomorrow.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.838
Ooh, no, tomorrow's
not good for me.

02:17.838 --> 02:18.739
What about Sunday?

02:18.739 --> 02:19.740
Sunday's not good either.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.941
My parents are
coming to visit.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.275
Oh, right.
Well, what about

02:22.275 --> 02:24.011
any morning before work?
Pick one.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.512
I don't know--
whatever. Wednesday.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.547
Maybe I'm crazy,
but you don't sound like

02:27.547 --> 02:28.782
you really want to play.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.318
Look, Sabrina, it's
nothing against you

02:31.318 --> 02:34.121
but I prefer to play
with people who are...

02:34.121 --> 02:35.589
you know, at my level.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.591
Well, I thought we were
pretty well-matched.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.825
I mean, I won three games.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.994
Technically.
The truth is, I was
kind of holding back

02:40.994 --> 02:42.663
to make you feel
better about yourself.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.665
Gee, thanks.
I feel phenomenal.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.266
Hey, it's not your fault.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.536
Most girls just aren't able
to play as well as guys.

02:49.536 --> 02:50.937
You can't help it.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.673
It's just the way
you're programmed.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.608
The way we're programmed?

02:54.608 --> 02:56.009
What am I, a VCR?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.411
Why don't we just
drop it, okay?

02:57.411 --> 02:59.413
I'm starving. Let's go
get something to eat.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.480
I don't know.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.449
You know, I think I need
to eat with a girl

03:02.449 --> 03:03.617
to keep my skills sharp.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.052
You're just not up
to my level.

03:05.052 --> 03:08.155
Eating? You know, most girls
wouldn't want to admit that.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.057
Well, we don't like to brag.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.858
It's not the way
we're programmed.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.528
All right... before we commit
to getting cable

03:14.528 --> 03:15.996
we have to discuss
the options.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.631
We can go with
the premium package

03:17.631 --> 03:20.300
which gives us nine HBO's,
but no other movie channels.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.002
Or the platinum package

03:22.002 --> 03:24.204
which gives us movie channels

03:24.204 --> 03:27.007
the Home Surgery Network
and 16 HBO's.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.642
Which option's $20 a month?

03:28.642 --> 03:31.978
We get an on-off switch
and the German sitcom channel.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.514
You're not going to believe
what Josh just said.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.216
He had the incredible arrogance

03:36.216 --> 03:39.486
to say that women can't play
tennis at the same level as men.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.854
He creamed you,
didn't he?

03:40.854 --> 03:42.622
No, he did not.
And even if he did

03:42.622 --> 03:45.592
I mean, there are tons of great
women tennis players...

03:45.592 --> 03:47.394
Venus, Serena, Martina...

03:47.394 --> 03:48.829
I have to agree with Josh.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.630
When it comes to
physical prowess

03:50.630 --> 03:52.933
men are the stronger sex.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.236
There are exceptions.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.504
For the honor
of women everywhere

03:57.504 --> 03:58.572
you need to show Josh

03:58.572 --> 04:00.674
you're as good a tennis player
as he is.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.209
One little problem: I'm not.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.845
Yet. You can't expect to play
once a year and be great.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.413
You just need practice.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.316
And you need steroids.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.255
Ooh!

04:18.058 --> 04:21.595
Okay, practice doesn't
necessarily make perfect.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.830
I need professional help.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.233
Oh... like all women

04:26.233 --> 04:29.436
you suffer from severe
tennis envy.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.504
Wrong professional.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.273
Oh, by the way, Dr. Freud,
your fly's open.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.743
Andy Roddick;
much better.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.979
Whoa. This isn't Wimbledon.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.980
Who are you?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.314
Uh, let's put it this way

04:41.314 --> 04:44.217
I've won almost as many Grand
Slams as Anna Kournikova.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.652
Sabrina Spellman. Big fan.

04:45.652 --> 04:46.887
Nice to meet you, Sabrina.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.988
What can I do for you?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.556
Teach me everything
you know about tennis

04:49.556 --> 04:50.924
so I can be as good
as my boyfriend.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.392
Oh, and you have to
do it in one lesson.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.479
You hit the ball well, Sabrina.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.347
Now you just have to learn
how to hit it in the court.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.750
Now you tell me.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.619
That's good, Sabrina.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.388
Excellent.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.424
Sorry.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.425
For what?

05:25.425 --> 05:26.426
That was a great shot.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.928
Never apologize
for hitting a winner.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.096
Yeah, I guess then you'd
be apologizing all the time.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.097
You got that right.

05:31.097 --> 05:32.098
You have a lot
of potential

05:32.098 --> 05:33.366
but the thing you
need to work on

05:33.366 --> 05:34.334
is being more
competitive.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.735
That's the only way
you're going to win.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.037
I'll try that.
Thanks, Andy.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.839
You want to go get
something to eat?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.007
Thanks, but I should probably
get back to Wimbledon now.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.510
Oh, yeah, right.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.547
Double, double,
boil and trouble.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.482
Dress the cat
like Barney Rubble.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.053
Well, it looks better on me
than it did on John Goodman.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.654
Now you try one, Amanda.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.523
Incantations are so Middle Ages.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.991
Nobody does them anymore.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.259
That doesn't rhyme.

05:59.259 --> 06:02.462
Amanda, incantations are
a big part of the test.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.331
If you want the Witches Council
to pass you

06:04.331 --> 06:05.799
you better learn how to do them.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.000
Okay, if you insist.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.401
Incantations are so dumb

06:08.401 --> 06:11.404
make Aunt Zelda
suck her thumb.

06:11.404 --> 06:12.739
Now you're catching on.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.441
I'll say it loud.
I'll say it clear.

06:14.441 --> 06:15.742
Make Aunt Hilda disappear.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.344
Well done.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.845
I'll say.

06:18.845 --> 06:22.115
Now, get me Ann-Margrock
on the phone.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.451
Okay, now don't
hold back this time.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.020
I guarantee you I'm
going to give you a
run for your money

06:27.020 --> 06:28.288
even if I am just a girl.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.497
That's game. Five-one.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.099
Sabrina, you're hitting

06:39.099 --> 06:40.734
the ball really well.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.703
Yeah, but I'm still losing.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.273
I guess I just don't have it
in me to be competitive.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.607
Hey, Josh, I thought
that was you.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.775
Dave, what are you
doing here?

06:48.775 --> 06:49.943
My partner, he
didn't show up.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.211
Hey, are you up
for another game

06:51.211 --> 06:52.612
when you're finished?

06:52.612 --> 06:53.813
Boy, am I.

06:53.813 --> 06:56.082
Just give me a minute
while I polish Sabrina off.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.183
Polish me off?

06:57.183 --> 07:01.121
Shh... I'll show him
who's going to get polished off.

07:01.388 --> 07:04.057
Oh, "Competitive Ade."

07:10.230 --> 07:13.934
Mmm... fruity,
with a hint of rocket fuel.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.568
Okay, I'm ready...

07:15.568 --> 07:18.104
to wipe the court with you.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.244
15-love.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.813
I must say, I did love it.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.258
Whoo, my point!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.794
Game, set, match.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.762
That was an amazing
comeback, Sabrina.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.197
What happened to you?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.099
Well, I wanted to
play at your level

07:46.099 --> 07:47.734
so I just got
more competitive.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.003
And I made sure to
drink plenty of fluids.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.909
Okay, let's go over this
cable package one more time.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.243
Mm-hmm.

07:57.243 --> 08:00.613
We're getting coax select
service with digital four-pack

08:00.613 --> 08:03.750
cable modem ready, reduced-rate
digital pay-per-view

08:03.750 --> 08:05.352
and free splitters, right?

08:05.352 --> 08:08.188
Right.
Now, will you sign here
so I can start wiring?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.390
We've been negotiating
for over an hour.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.792
Whoo-hoo. I just
beat Josh at tennis.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.795
Congratulations.
And congratulations to Miles

08:15.795 --> 08:17.330
for getting us
a great cable deal.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.798
I'm not finished yet.

08:18.798 --> 08:19.866
There's more?

08:19.866 --> 08:21.668
Oh, yes. And
make no mistake

08:21.668 --> 08:23.603
without this we
have no deal.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.939
I want a free pen.

08:26.940 --> 08:27.974
He may be a techie nerd

08:27.974 --> 08:30.176
but when it comes to
negotiating, he's the best.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.211
I don't think so.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.879
I can get us a much
more competitive rate.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.481
Hey!

08:34.481 --> 08:36.516
Okay... here's what
you're going to give us:

08:36.516 --> 08:38.585
everything in this contract
plus free hookup

08:38.585 --> 08:40.420
free service
for the first three months

08:40.420 --> 08:42.455
all the premium channels
at no extra charge

08:42.455 --> 08:43.523
and that pen.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.758
This was my
late grandfather's pen.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.792
Why should I give it to you?

08:45.792 --> 08:46.893
Because you don't want us

08:46.893 --> 08:48.528
to take our business
to another cable company

08:48.528 --> 08:50.330
and I'm sure your boss
wouldn't want that either.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.332
You know, I'd hate to have
to write something negative

08:52.332 --> 08:53.666
about you under
"customer comments."

08:53.666 --> 08:54.801
Boy, she's getting ugly.

She sure is.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.537
See if you can get
the naked channel.

The last thing I want
is for you to lose your job.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.074
All right.

Okay, Amanda, this film

09:08.848 --> 09:10.383
all the etiquette rules
you need to know

09:10.383 --> 09:11.785
in order to get your
witch's license.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.186
Look, I want to pass the test

09:13.186 --> 09:15.188
but do I really have to watch
some ancient film

09:15.188 --> 09:16.423
about witch etiquette?

09:16.423 --> 09:17.524
Absolutely.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.793
You must learn the proper
way to ride a vacuum

09:19.793 --> 09:21.294
to dispose of
leftover potions

09:21.294 --> 09:23.630
and to write
thank-you notes.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.532

parents, Ben and Geri.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.244
Hey, great to
see you again.

I've been meaning
to ask you guys

09:39.746 --> 09:41.981
whose idea was
"Chunky Monkey"?

09:42.515 --> 09:45.118
So Josh tells us
you've become quite
a tennis player.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.188
He says you suddenly developed
this wild competitive streak.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.222
I like that.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.291
I like it more
than you do.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.459
Well, Geri and I play.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.994
Maybe we could book a court,
play some doubles tomorrow?

09:54.994 --> 09:56.529
Why wait till tomorrow?

09:56.529 --> 09:58.631
I'm ready to kick
some butt right now.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.183
Come on, Ben, look alive.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.651
Yeah, I told you
she was good.

10:18.651 --> 10:19.652
That was nice, Sabrina.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.087
I always wanted to do that
to him

10:21.087 --> 10:23.022
but he doesn't like to play
singles with me.

10:23.022 --> 10:23.723
Why not?

10:23.723 --> 10:24.724
He doesn't think

10:24.724 --> 10:25.959
I'm competitive enough.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.360
Apparently, only men are.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.896
Oh, now I see where
you got that attitude.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.131
It's time to put
an end to that.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.133
I propose a battle of the sexes.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.200
Women against men.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.236
Right here, right now, right on.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.937
I don't think
that's a good idea.

10:37.937 --> 10:39.506
Why not?
Afraid we'll beat you?

10:39.506 --> 10:40.540
Please.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.641
Well, then stop stalling

10:41.641 --> 10:43.076
and trade places with your mom.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.211
Come on, Josh.
If that's what the ladies want.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.746

you different.

Oh, and we're in this to
win; don't forget that.

shot, Sabrina.

11:11.971 --> 11:14.107
Have you ever thought of playing
professionally?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.242
No, it's not competitive enough
for me.

Hey, what's wrong
with you wimps?

11:18.044 --> 11:20.046

your Wheaties this morning?

Or did you just forget
how to hit a ball?

Would you lighten up a little
on Dad?

For some reason he doesn't like
being called wimp

about me being selfish anymore

was having a better time--

When he threw his racket

13:02.715 --> 13:04.717

his head against the wall?

I'm just as aggressive
and competitive as he is.

17:13.966 --> 17:16.903
I guess we just need
to remember that this
competition thing

17:16.903 --> 17:18.271
can get really
out of hand.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.239
Hey, I promise
to lighten up if you do.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.574
Deal.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.310
Now, what are we going
to do about my parents?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.279
Maybe if we can get them
back out on the court

17:26.279 --> 17:27.213
they'll see how much fun
we're having

17:27.213 --> 17:28.414
and they'll
lighten up, too.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.249
You know parents--
the only way they learn

17:30.249 --> 17:31.250
is by example.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.518
Worth a shot.

17:32.518 --> 17:35.021
Hey, if I become
my father

17:35.021 --> 17:37.590
and my father
becomes me--

17:37.590 --> 17:40.927
am I my own grandpa?

17:43.095 --> 17:45.531
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda,
thanks for trying

17:45.531 --> 17:47.800
but I'm mailing myself
back to school.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.101
ZELDA:
Not so fast.

18:49.595 --> 18:50.763
Hey, where's
your dad?

18:50.763 --> 18:51.964
Said he was going
to meet us here.

18:51.964 --> 18:52.965
Where's my mom?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.734
Said she was going
to meet us here.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.937
BEN:
Ball, please.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.106
Dad? Mom?

19:00.106 --> 19:02.141
You guys are actually
playing together?

19:02.141 --> 19:05.911
Well, if you can call
what she's doing playing.

19:05.911 --> 19:06.812
If I'm not playing

19:06.812 --> 19:09.281
how come I'm winning two-love?

19:09.281 --> 19:13.152
A lucky bounce, glare,
and a bad call on a great serve.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.654
It was out!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.856
Boy, we've got a
lot of work to do
with these two.

19:16.856 --> 19:17.957
How do you want
to start?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.692
We get in the car,
we never look back.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.292
You want to leave
them like this?

19:20.292 --> 19:22.128
I thought we were going
to set an example.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.729
They're together,
they're talking.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.331
With them, that's
as good as it gets.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.332
You really think so?

19:26.332 --> 19:27.500
This is who they are.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.068
They're never
going to change.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.670
The good news is,
that I can.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.138
That is good news.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.139
Race you to the car?

19:33.139 --> 19:34.874
Have you learned nothing?
Sorry.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.142
Hey!

19:47.453 --> 19:48.754
I've got to work
on that.

19:48.754 --> 19:49.422
You're playing
well, Sabrina

19:49.422 --> 19:50.322
but I've got
to get rolling

19:50.322 --> 19:51.891
I'm just going
to polish you off

19:51.891 --> 19:53.159
and then
I'm out of here.

19:53.159 --> 19:54.760
Polish me off.

19:55.094 --> 19:58.798
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt
to have one more little drink.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.475
Okay, I'm ready to play.

20:14.246 --> 20:15.247
Amazing.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.549
Is there any chance
you'll play mixed doubles

20:16.549 --> 20:17.683
with me at Wimbledon?

20:17.683 --> 20:19.885
No, you know,
I'm not really into

20:19.885 --> 20:20.720
the whole competitive thing.
