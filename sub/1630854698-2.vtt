Yay!

01:10.112 --> 01:12.031
The end.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.366
There are seven more pages, Mama.

01:14.366 --> 01:19.038
Gerhilde, what did we say
about calling me that?

01:19.038 --> 01:20.372
Fine... Governess.

01:20.372 --> 01:25.419
Papa never reads us stories
when he's home.

01:25.419 --> 01:29.423
Your papa is a very busy man.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.092
He travels near and far.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.053
That's why he hired me.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.933
I heard Lady Himmelman said
he hired you because he's a...

01:38.933 --> 01:41.769
..."tit man more than
an ass man."

01:43.187 --> 01:46.065
Gerhilde, please go
the fuck to sleep.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.363
I love you, Governess.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.663
And I you, child.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.928
Good night, Mama.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.104
Sir?

02:25.104 --> 02:26.313
Because
my stories

02:26.313 --> 02:28.315
don't have happy
endings any longer.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.152
That's why their papa
tells them stories no more.

02:34.864 --> 02:37.741
It is an honor to meet you.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.953
Six months is a long time.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.538
I'm happy to be home.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.165
It's been hard on them
since their mother's death.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.251
But I've been told
these past few months with you

02:47.251 --> 02:49.211
have been the happiest time
of their life.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.421
And mine.

02:53.549 --> 02:56.468
I've dreamed of this day
since I came here.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.680
But may I confess something?

02:59.680 --> 03:03.058
I didn't come here
for the children.

03:03.058 --> 03:08.188
I came so that one day I might
get close enough to steal

03:08.188 --> 03:12.318
the heart of the courageous
Rolf Van Klaussen.

03:26.498 --> 03:30.210
And I do mean
steal the heart, Nazi.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.589
Tell me where he is.

03:33.589 --> 03:36.258
I know he's in South America;
tell me how to find him.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.801
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.678
You have been overseeing
the export of arms

03:39.678 --> 03:40.679
through São Paulo.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.431
You've been sending them to him.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.849
Now tell me where he is.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.185
Fräulein?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.689
Papa!

03:55.653 --> 03:57.071
No.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.992
I'm sorry.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.124
Mama.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.835
<i>High up on these mountains ♪</i>

04:11.835 --> 04:13.420

05:39.882 --> 05:41.550
You cold?

05:49.808 --> 05:51.477
You look like shit.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.854
Good thing I brought you a gift.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.647
Uh, it's not a good time.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.776
Killed Biff Simpson
two nights ago

05:58.776 --> 06:00.944
in a brothel in Paris.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.280
An old SS haunt.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.199
Shot him through the face.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.287
Uh, if you are here
for confession,

06:10.287 --> 06:12.039
you are at the wrong place.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.541
Confessions are for sins.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.628
He tried to bargain
for his life.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.505
Claimed, if I let him live,

06:19.505 --> 06:22.382
he could bring me
a greater prize.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.927
What?

06:26.095 --> 06:27.096
Hitler.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.438
- You don't really believe...
- He claimed Hitler fled Europe

06:36.438 --> 06:38.857
via ratline and was living
down in South America.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.110
- And what proof did he have?
- We met the proof.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.778
The Colonel.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.406
- Bullshit.
- What other woman could rise

06:46.406 --> 06:48.826
- so high in the ranks?
- Eva Braun killed herself

06:48.826 --> 06:50.619
in the Führerbunker in 1945,
as did Adolf Hitler.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.204
How do you know?

06:52.204 --> 06:54.873
- Hitler's dead, Jonah.
- Says who? The Russians?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.708
They found his body
and just simply burned it?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.085
You really believe that?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.711
People believed
Eichmann was dead too,

06:59.711 --> 07:02.172
until Mossad found him
in South America.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.217
Eichmann, Mengele, Stangl,
Wilhelm Zuchs.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.969
Nazis don't just disappear.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.930
They don't simply
kill themselves.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.812
Before he died,
Biff Simpson said,

07:16.812 --> 07:19.898
"All roads lead through Genoa."

07:21.733 --> 07:23.235
Why Genoa?

07:23.235 --> 07:25.195
Didn't make
any sense to me,

07:25.195 --> 07:28.490
and then I realized
that Genoa is where Eichmann

07:28.490 --> 07:29.825
had fled Europe.

07:29.825 --> 07:33.662
Josef Mengele, too, in July '49.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.664
My contact pulled records

07:35.664 --> 07:38.917
showing that the ships
that ran from Genoa

07:38.917 --> 07:42.421
to Buenos Aires were charted
by a German steel conglomerate

07:42.421 --> 07:44.131
called Essen Industries.

07:44.131 --> 07:48.552
Turns out on April 29, 1945,
Essen Industries also chartered

07:48.552 --> 07:51.430
a ship from Genoa
to Buenos Aires.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.932
Hitler and Eva committed
suicide on the 30th.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.851
What, you think
they were on the ship?

07:55.851 --> 07:57.644
Among the names were
two crewmembers never before

07:57.644 --> 07:59.521
listed on any manifest:

07:59.521 --> 08:01.106
Erik Tolmann
and Frida Tolmann.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.818
Essen Industries' founder
is a man named Klaus Rhinehart.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.070
The Nazi financier.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.698
Now, he is a free man
living in, of all places...

08:10.741 --> 08:12.701
Buenos Aires.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.578
He runs Argentina's
steel industry.

08:17.289 --> 08:20.709
I can charter a plane,
fly us down there undetected.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.004
We find Klaus Rhinehart,
we find Hitler.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.716
We have to tell the Feds.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.134
Aw, fuck. Come on.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.887
What is... what has going to
the Feds ever got you?

08:31.887 --> 08:34.806
A fucking gag order to keep
quiet about Biff Simpson?

08:34.806 --> 08:38.101
A not guilty verdict
for Bishop Prentz?

08:42.564 --> 08:44.733
Why are you here, Jonah? Why me?

08:49.571 --> 08:52.783
Because I can't
do this alone, and...

08:55.619 --> 08:59.831
...I know that you're the only
one that might believe me.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.801
Well, you're in over your head.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.511
Why did you call me?

09:12.511 --> 09:14.846
Why did you call me
when you lost the Prentz case?

09:14.846 --> 09:16.306
Tell me, why?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.891
Maybe it's because you realized

09:17.891 --> 09:20.269
that justice is a privilege
reserved for the few.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.728
And maybe...

09:22.729 --> 09:25.482
...you were looking
for another path.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.776
We find Hitler...

09:28.819 --> 09:30.028
...and everything
that we have done,

09:30.028 --> 09:32.155
everything that
we have become...

09:35.367 --> 09:37.160
...will have been worth it.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.746
And it can finally be over.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.467
I thought you would understand.

10:00.684 --> 10:01.685
I'm in.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.733
But we can't do it alone,
so where are your friends?

10:09.192 --> 10:12.195
Uh, we're not exactly
on speaking terms.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.324
Then I'll do the talking.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.415
<i>Hola. Hola.</i>

10:23.415 --> 10:26.043
Tatiana Suarez-Pico here
for another installment

10:26.043 --> 10:28.378
of <i>Tatiana at the Movies.</i>

10:28.378 --> 10:31.548
I am here
with film star Lonny Flash

10:31.548 --> 10:34.718
talking about his new movie
<i>Eight Ways to Shabbat.</i>

10:35.719 --> 10:37.387
<i>Hola,</i> Lonny.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.889
<i>Bonjour,</i> Tatiana.

10:38.889 --> 10:42.684
In <i>Eight Ways to Shabbat,</i>
you play a Jewish hitman

10:42.684 --> 10:45.562
who has a crisis of faith
as he attempts to kill

10:45.562 --> 10:47.189
eight men before sundown.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.941
Two years away and now you're
garnering Oscar buzz.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.902
It must feel wonderful.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.363
Accolades and awards
are nice and all, but...

10:55.364 --> 10:59.284
...I make films for
the seamstress' girl in Nepal,

10:59.284 --> 11:02.329
for the salmon
farmer's kid in Yemen,

11:02.329 --> 11:04.456
for the Episcopalian
pastor's boy

11:04.456 --> 11:06.416
in Omaha, Nebraska who says,

11:06.416 --> 11:08.377
"Maybe when I grow up...

11:09.795 --> 11:10.921
...I can...

11:12.255 --> 11:14.299
...I can be a Jewish
movie star, too."

11:14.299 --> 11:16.426
My fans inspire me.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.594
Sorry.

11:24.434 --> 11:28.563
<i>Eight Ways to Shabbat</i>
hits theaters Friday the 21st.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.191
And... cut.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.736
Uh,
do you need a tissue?

11:34.736 --> 11:35.946
No, no.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.156
The tears are care
of Sandy Meisner.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.742
Mmm, no.
Not-not the tears.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.869
Uh...

11:44.121 --> 11:45.705
Your nose is bleeding.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.790
Ah.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.960
<i>Pásale algo así, ¿no? Ayúdale.</i>

11:49.960 --> 11:51.795
No, no, no, no. It's, uh...
It's okay.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.213
- Are you...? Okay.
- Thank you.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.923
Yeah, I'll see you next time,
all right? Thanks.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.258

<i>I'm sorry, sir,
there are no listings</i>

15:38.480 --> 15:40.690
<i>in Connecticut under that name.</i>

15:41.858 --> 15:43.068
The designers
are ready for you, sir.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.819
Oh. All right, Annette.
I'll be right there.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.906
We pared the design
down as you asked.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.575
Now, the wires allow
a lot more data input

15:50.575 --> 15:53.495
to be collected
within an instrument panel.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.290
Hey,
what the fuck, Mizushima?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.375
Hey.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.836
- What the fuck are you doing?
- It was an accident.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.254
You just
set us back three hours.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.422
Look, I just said
it was an accident.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.757
- You got a problem with us?
- Hey!

16:05.757 --> 16:07.133
You know what?
I'm out of here.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.718
- Come on, take a swing!
- Tough guy.

16:08.718 --> 16:09.928
Hey. Hey...

16:11.680 --> 16:12.639
Lay off him!

16:40.709 --> 16:42.210

17:31.926 --> 17:34.679

It's taking a while.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.185
I know.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.228
- Oh.
- It's crazy.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.064
Hmm.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.859

17:57.911 --> 17:59.454
Hurry up, man.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.052
I scream.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.307
You scream!

18:21.226 --> 18:22.977
We all scream.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.524
For ice cream.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.653
- Psycho.
- Let's get out of here.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.165

hmm?

19:06.521 --> 19:08.815
I see you haven't
changed a bit.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.816
No, I did.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.901
I got even more amazing.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.195
Can we just... can we just
focus on why we're here?

19:14.195 --> 19:15.238
Uh...

19:16.281 --> 19:18.032
Oh, you think you're still
giving orders, do you?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.784
Uh, didn't you hear?

19:19.784 --> 19:21.744
You charter a private jet
with Meyer's blood money,

19:21.744 --> 19:24.247
- you get to call the shots.
- Can we just please

19:24.247 --> 19:25.582
stop with these <i>mishegas...</i>

19:25.582 --> 19:26.875
Enough!

19:28.167 --> 19:31.504
Not letting your dysfunctional
family bullshit fuck this up.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.589
You get me?

19:35.592 --> 19:38.136
This is Klaus Rhinehart.

19:38.136 --> 19:41.264
German industrialist
and former Nazi financier,

19:41.264 --> 19:42.807
who now lives freely

19:42.807 --> 19:45.435
in Argentina as head of
the country's steel industry

19:45.435 --> 19:46.686
from which he makes a killing.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.605
When he travels,
it is with security.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.106
But lucky for us,
on Friday night

19:50.106 --> 19:52.066
he will be attending
the grand reopening

19:52.066 --> 19:54.861
of Buenos Aires'
oldest opera house,

19:54.861 --> 19:57.655
for which he helped
fund the restoration.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.741
There, we will take him.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.242
Alive.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.829
Klaus escaped Hitler
out of Germany.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.040
Klaus will know
where we can find him.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.417
One more run.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.044
One more run, then none of us

20:11.044 --> 20:13.212
have to see each other's
faces ever again.

20:15.465 --> 20:18.092
But, um, no one has found Joe?

20:19.677 --> 20:21.721
I have been looking
for Joe for years.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.934
I don't think
he wants to be found.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.886
All right.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.346
You can sit down.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.225
Well, I could have gone
to the police, Mr. Mizushima,

21:07.225 --> 21:08.434
after what happened yesterday.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.229
I don't stand for violence.

21:11.229 --> 21:15.650
This is a palace of invention,
not destruction.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.069
And I will not employ savages...

21:18.069 --> 21:20.738
Mr. Offerman, I can't
afford to lose another job.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.991
This is why I fired
the three heathens

21:22.991 --> 21:25.076
- who attacked you.
- Sir?

21:25.076 --> 21:27.578
And I'm very sorry
for what they did to you.

21:38.172 --> 21:41.092
How old were you when
they first imprisoned you?

21:42.093 --> 21:44.303
I read your file, so...

21:44.303 --> 21:45.722
Five.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.056
Five?

21:47.056 --> 21:49.183
I was in kindergarten
in San Francisco.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.855
I learned to read in the camps.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.150
"Internment camps,"
they called them.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.944
Yes.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.989
Two countries, two camps.

22:02.989 --> 22:06.159
Different in many ways,
but in the tenet, identical.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.412
To exterminate us.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.205
To extinguish our flame.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.625
Well, I see you, Joe.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.420
I see you.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.882
A young man drafted
to the front lines in Vietnam

22:20.882 --> 22:23.801
by a country that took
everything from him.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.720
No wonder your hand shakes.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.227
I wasn't drafted.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.395
I enlisted.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.730
Why?

22:35.730 --> 22:38.274
Because my father did.

22:38.274 --> 22:42.236
While we were imprisoned
in the camps...

22:43.279 --> 22:44.947
...he still served.

22:46.324 --> 22:47.700
And was killed.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.955
You know, I invited you here

22:52.955 --> 22:57.293
for more than just
to offer you an apology.

22:59.462 --> 23:03.508
I invited you here
to ask for your help.

23:03.508 --> 23:06.094
- Help?
- I recently learned

23:06.094 --> 23:11.099
that a man from my past
is still living in this world.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.018
A Nazi guard...

23:15.019 --> 23:17.814
...sadistic, cruel.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.941
And I need your help...

23:20.942 --> 23:22.902
...to find him.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.779
Why are you asking me?

23:25.905 --> 23:29.408
Because I know
a fellow forever soldier

23:29.408 --> 23:31.619
when I see one, Joe.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.874
You father fought
those monsters, too.

23:36.874 --> 23:39.001
He fought them.

23:39.001 --> 23:43.214
He fought them in France.
He fought them in Germany.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.924
He looked in their eyes.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.761
Black and cold,
the Nazi bastards.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.057
Your father died

23:53.057 --> 23:55.476
ridding the world
of this scourge, Joe.

23:56.477 --> 23:57.728
But evil is still here.

23:57.728 --> 24:00.565
You can join this struggle.

24:00.565 --> 24:03.484
A resistance against this evil.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.778
You can help.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.865
How?

24:10.825 --> 24:12.535
Enlist.

24:43.524 --> 24:48.112
We're here, amigo.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.573
<i>Ah, gracias.</i>

25:26.192 --> 25:27.652
<i>Get settled, unpack.</i>

25:27.652 --> 25:29.153
<i>Meet in the lobby at 8:00 p.m.</i>

25:29.153 --> 25:30.112
Hello.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.531
Welcome to the Hotel Palladio.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.628
This reminds me of that place
we ended up in in Rome.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.255
When you got us lost.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.673
No, we weren't lost. I just...

25:48.673 --> 25:51.884
You just wanted to show me
the real Rome. Uh-huh.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.511
Look, on the main streets

25:53.511 --> 25:55.388
we'd been mobbed by
the Flash fanatics.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.722
On the back streets...

25:56.722 --> 25:58.641
...it was just us.

25:59.809 --> 26:03.771
Come on, you had fun.
Don't deny it.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.149
The pizza was good.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.157
I'll see you tonight.

26:16.701 --> 26:18.035
Yeah.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.057
Look pretty tonight, boy.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.937
You should knock first.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.990
Do you never even think
about Spain?

26:56.991 --> 26:58.868
About what you did?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.790
I think about that boy
every day.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.044
I see him every day.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.133
I'll see you at 8:00.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.334
was at Ethel Shteinberg's

29:12.334 --> 29:15.045
And tomorrow starts her shiva.

29:15.045 --> 29:17.089

29:17.089 --> 29:18.591
- we've been out

- Yeah.

29:18.591 --> 29:21.135
- But you're a busy man, Simon.
- No.

29:21.135 --> 29:24.805
What? Taking on Friedrich
Peter and his Freedom Party

29:24.805 --> 29:26.432
- was no small feat.
- Well,

29:26.432 --> 29:28.142
I don't believe
a man responsible

29:28.142 --> 29:31.437
for the extermination
of 13,000 Jews in Ukraine

29:31.437 --> 29:34.356
is deserving of leading
Austria into a new era.

29:34.356 --> 29:35.566
- Bravo, my friend.
- No!

29:35.566 --> 29:37.860
Please, please.
I just do God's work.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.029
- A prophet stands before me.
- No, no, no prophet.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.071
A patsy.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.281
Come, come, my friend. Sit down.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.408
Yes, of course.

29:44.408 --> 29:48.287
Scott said that you needed
to see me right away.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.580
Well...

29:49.580 --> 29:52.666
I saw... him.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.752
Right on 79th Street.

29:54.752 --> 29:56.545
Getting into a car.

29:56.545 --> 29:57.671
Saw who?

29:57.671 --> 29:59.340
Viktor Frondheim.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.634
- Viktor Frondheim?
- Yes.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.929
- Sounds familiar.
- I remember him
from the camps.

30:04.929 --> 30:08.349
He was an SS guard on Block 11.

30:08.349 --> 30:12.228
If any Jews managed
to escape, they sent him,

30:12.228 --> 30:14.772
and he always came back
with them in his jaws.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.690
Dead.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.026
Like he was a bloodhound.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.819
So tell me, um...

30:20.819 --> 30:22.905
do you have any idea
where he might be going?

30:24.156 --> 30:27.910
Connecticut... I think,
because the car had, uh,

30:27.910 --> 30:30.663
- Connecticut plates.
- Hmm.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.499
Maybe you have
information on that?

30:33.499 --> 30:36.085
Somewhere? Perhaps I can see it?

30:36.085 --> 30:39.880
Perhaps something
that I could be helpful with?

30:40.923 --> 30:45.469
No, no, no. I'm very grateful
for the offer, but no.

30:45.469 --> 30:48.556
I-I would never put you
in that position.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.724
I can't have a prince
doing yeoman's work.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.059
Oh, no, please.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.686
I will take it from here.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.438
So...

30:56.438 --> 30:58.732
thank you for the tip,
my friend.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.319
I will take care of it.
How about that?

31:02.319 --> 31:03.862
You would do that for me?

31:03.862 --> 31:04.947
Of course.

31:04.947 --> 31:08.492
Oh, you are blessing
from Hashem.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.119
Meyer, for you, anything.

31:10.119 --> 31:12.079
- Oh.
- Please.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.039
And if you do happen
to see this, uh,

31:14.039 --> 31:15.833
Viktor Frondheim again,
do let me know.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.585
Of course.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.461
The prophet.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.591
Be well, my friend.

31:23.591 --> 31:24.925
Mazel tov.

31:37.438 --> 31:41.358
Scott, see if we have a file
on a Viktor Frondheim.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.573
Hold the elevator.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.719
Just as you said.
And the other file's there, too.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.596
Well done.

32:10.596 --> 32:11.972
Here.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.892
For your troubles.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.103
I wasn't drafted into this.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.480
I enlisted.

33:45.983 --> 33:50.279
I mean, I am dying to know.

33:51.739 --> 33:53.240
What did they do to you?

33:53.240 --> 33:56.201
Because you have undergone
a real transformation, friend.

33:58.495 --> 34:01.290
My parents
tried to rehabilitate me, too.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.042
I saw a social worker,
did therapy,

34:04.042 --> 34:05.502
repented, cried.

34:05.502 --> 34:08.338
Hell, I praised Jesus so much...

34:13.802 --> 34:16.847
...and a lot of love,
a man can change.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.641
But it didn't really take.

34:19.641 --> 34:20.726
So...

34:22.561 --> 34:25.063
Between pals, I'm just asking...

34:26.231 --> 34:28.150
...you faking?

34:29.693 --> 34:31.111
You can tell me.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.031
I'm a vault.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.289
She's over there.

35:09.233 --> 35:10.943
I failed you
in New York.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.446
So why bring me here?

35:16.448 --> 35:19.409
Take off your boots.
They're filthy.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.842
When I first
saw Adolf,

35:34.842 --> 35:38.303
I was just a child
and he was a...

35:38.303 --> 35:39.596
god.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.391
An eagle...

35:43.851 --> 35:47.145
...who soared on golden wings
above all the Earth.

35:50.399 --> 35:52.442
Your trousers are muddy.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.319
Take them off.

35:54.319 --> 35:57.531
He groomed me when I was
still a child, 17.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.826
I was a gymnast.

36:02.119 --> 36:03.328
Accomplished.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.622
He liked that.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.251
Your shirt.

36:14.548 --> 36:15.966
I remember

36:15.966 --> 36:18.719
our first night together
in his apartment in Munich.

36:19.761 --> 36:22.055
I crawled into bed with him.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.017
The eagle.

36:26.059 --> 36:29.271
And... uh, he was no god.

36:30.606 --> 36:31.899
He was...

36:33.442 --> 36:34.902
...small and...

36:36.320 --> 36:38.572
...pasty, and...

36:38.572 --> 36:42.409
balding, and sweaty,
and pathetic.

36:42.409 --> 36:45.454
But all the rest of them,
they still see the eagle.

36:45.454 --> 36:46.955
They don't see me.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.708
I sent for you
because you see me.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.251
You always have.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.338
And I deserve to be seen.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.679
He can't fathom
the way forward anymore.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.432
I can.

37:05.432 --> 37:08.560
I know how we can retake power.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.231
Clean yourself off.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.791
Now we can finally begin...

37:31.792 --> 37:33.335
...my way.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.644
<i>It's showtime.</i>

37:50.644 --> 37:53.355
<i>We find Klaus Rhinehart,
we find Hitler.</i>

37:56.274 --> 37:59.194
<i>Klaus will have his guards
watching him.</i>

37:59.194 --> 38:02.280
<i>We take them out,
then Millie will take Klaus.</i>

38:15.252 --> 38:17.254
Boss says you can take a break.

38:52.289 --> 38:54.124
Here you are, sir. Number 88.

40:37.227 --> 40:38.186
Hello?

40:54.077 --> 40:57.080
<i>¿Ochenta y ocho?</i>

40:57.080 --> 40:59.624
<i>Sí.</i>

41:38.830 --> 41:41.082
Come on, you're on.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.918
Don't touch me.
What are you doing?

41:42.918 --> 41:46.463
Hey, hey. Wait. What?
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

41:46.463 --> 41:49.549
Whoa, hey! Hey! Hey, come on!

41:56.681 --> 41:57.641
Oh, shit.

43:48.835 --> 43:49.836
Put it down.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.646
Run.

44:11.191 --> 44:13.526
I've been looking
for you, Klaus.

44:54.526 --> 44:56.569
<i>Gute Nacht,</i> motherfucker.

45:04.411 --> 45:06.413
Nazi fuck!

45:19.175 --> 45:20.552
What's in it and who's it for?

45:20.552 --> 45:22.137
I don't know.

45:25.140 --> 45:27.851
- Where are you taking it?
- Fuck you!

45:27.851 --> 45:29.477
Tell me
or you're a dead man.

45:29.477 --> 45:30.520
Who's it for?

45:30.520 --> 45:31.771
Ah!

45:59.799 --> 46:02.260
Moron.

46:06.848 --> 46:08.349
Drop the gun, Jonah.

46:08.349 --> 46:10.477
What the fuck
are you doing, Harriet?

46:11.478 --> 46:14.230
- I said drop the fucking gun.
- What the fuck are you doing?
