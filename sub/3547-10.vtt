00:00.083 --> 00:01.959
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.250 --> 00:04.750
<i>Orson's wife, Alma, disappeared.</i>

00:05.500 --> 00:07.083
<i>Gabby found a new calling.</i>

00:07.166 --> 00:09.041
Yes, I'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.458
<i>Someone new moved in.</i>

00:10.542 --> 00:12.792
He's a bachelor
who lives with his invalid sister.

00:12.875 --> 00:14.750
<i>But Lynette found a dark secret.</i>

00:14.834 --> 00:16.917
<i>Our neighbour is a paedophile.</i>

00:17.000 --> 00:19.583
You can't sit on this, Lynette.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.750
<i>Orson's mother revealed his past.</i>

00:21.834 --> 00:22.959
He cheated on Alma.

00:23.041 --> 00:25.500
Broke her heart,
for his precious Monique.

00:25.583 --> 00:26.750
Monique Polier?

00:26.834 --> 00:28.542
<i>And the police</i>
<i>couldn't find the evidence...</i>

00:28.625 --> 00:29.834
We couldn't find a toolbox.

00:29.917 --> 00:31.083
The man's a plumber.

00:31.166 --> 00:32.542
<i>...until Mike tried to hide it.</i>

00:32.625 --> 00:33.959
I'll take those.

00:40.875 --> 00:45.458
<i>The annual block party was</i>
<i>a winter tradition on Wisteria Lane.</i>

00:48.250 --> 00:52.291
<i>It was a way for the residents</i>
<i>to spread holiday cheer.</i>

00:54.166 --> 00:56.125
<i>Everyone was invited.</i>

00:58.375 --> 01:02.959
<i>Including Art Sheppard,</i>
<i>the newest resident of Wisteria Lane.</i>

01:04.583 --> 01:06.875
<i>But as the big night drew near,</i>

01:06.959 --> 01:10.500
<i>more than holiday cheer</i>
<i>was being spread around.</i>

01:10.583 --> 01:14.166
Hey. Did you hear about the new guy
that just moved in?

01:14.250 --> 01:16.750
Well, get a load of this.

01:16.834 --> 01:20.667
Apparently, the perv's got
all this weird stuff in his basement.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.125
No, seriously.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.875
It's like this
big kiddie trap full of toys.

01:27.959 --> 01:31.625
<i>By Sunday evening,</i>
<i>most of the gossiping had subsided,</i>

01:31.709 --> 01:33.709
<i>and the neighbourhood</i>
<i>was once again</i>

01:33.792 --> 01:36.542
<i>consumed by the spirit of the season.</i>

01:37.417 --> 01:39.750
<i>Friends laughed over eggnog,</i>

01:40.208 --> 01:42.667
<i>lovers kissed under mistletoe,</i>

01:43.625 --> 01:45.792
<i>and the mood was jolly.</i>

01:47.834 --> 01:52.000
<i>That is, until a certain guest</i>
<i>made his appearance.</i>

02:00.583 --> 02:03.166
Ho, ho, ho!

02:05.083 --> 02:07.458
Look who's here!

02:09.291 --> 02:12.208
Merry Christmas, everybody!

02:12.291 --> 02:14.125
Merry Christmas!

02:14.208 --> 02:17.000
Don't you do that!
Don't you know what he did?

02:17.083 --> 02:20.208
Now, kids, who's been good this year?

02:30.959 --> 02:33.417
Oh, come on. Everybody was naughty?

02:35.792 --> 02:38.208
What am I gonna do
with this fire truck?

02:38.291 --> 02:40.125
Joey, get back here!

02:44.333 --> 02:46.041
What's going on?

02:47.750 --> 02:49.291
I'm not sure.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.792
Let's go, girls.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.333
Art, maybe we should go.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.458
<i>Yes, for the residents</i>
<i>of Wisteria Lane,</i>

03:02.542 --> 03:05.291
<i>it was the most wonderful time</i>
<i>of the year.</i>

03:11.458 --> 03:14.333
<i>But for Arthur Sheppard and his sister,</i>

03:14.417 --> 03:18.500
<i>it had turned out</i>
<i>to be a very silent night.</i>

03:24.000 --> 03:26.125
<i>For the residents of Wisteria Lane,</i>

03:26.208 --> 03:29.709
<i>the holiday season could only begin</i>

03:30.000 --> 03:32.208
<i>once the decorations came out.</i>

03:34.583 --> 03:37.875
<i>For some, that meant</i>
<i>pulling out the coloured lights.</i>

03:39.917 --> 03:43.792
<i>For others, it meant locating</i>
<i>that holiday wreath.</i>

03:45.583 --> 03:49.875
<i>And then there were those</i>
<i>eager to display their Nativity scene.</i>

03:52.000 --> 03:56.542
<i>But for a romantic few,</i>
<i>it was all about the mistletoe.</i>

03:58.542 --> 04:00.709
You have to kiss me. It's the law.

04:03.625 --> 04:06.208
While you're in a good mood,
I thought I'd spring something on you.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.041
My parents are coming to town.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.542
Your parents? Really?

04:09.625 --> 04:13.458
And I wondered if you might be free
to join us for dinner Saturday.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.291
Absolutely!

04:15.375 --> 04:18.000
So I assume this means
they know about me?

04:18.083 --> 04:20.375
- But of course.
- And they know about me as in,

04:20.458 --> 04:21.917
"Mum, Dad, bloody good news!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.375
"I've got myself
a smashing new girlfriend"?

04:24.458 --> 04:27.333
That's adorable.
Please don't do it in front of them.

04:27.417 --> 04:28.625
Right.

04:28.709 --> 04:32.500
So, do you want me to make
reservations at that little French place?

04:32.583 --> 04:34.041
We could do that.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.959
But it's a four-hour layover
and they're going to be exhausted.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.000
And I thought we might have a more
enjoyable time

04:39.083 --> 04:42.041
if they came here
and you made dinner for them.

04:43.959 --> 04:47.083
Okay, I guess it's time
we have the conversation.

04:49.625 --> 04:54.917
Ian, haven't you ever wondered
why I've never cooked for you?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.959
I just assumed that you were lazy.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.959
I wish.

05:00.041 --> 05:03.375
My cooking is not good.

05:03.458 --> 05:06.333
Well, my parents won't be expecting
a gourmet meal.

05:06.417 --> 05:08.417
Will they be expecting
stomach cramps?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.250
Acid reflux? Night sweats?

05:10.333 --> 05:12.375
Come on. You can't be that bad.

05:18.417 --> 05:22.542
Oh, is it really important that
I make them a home-cooked meal?

05:22.625 --> 05:26.083
It's just they're very old-fashioned,
hearth-and-home types.

05:26.166 --> 05:29.875
And they might wonder
why you didn't make the effort.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.208
But it's okay.

05:31.291 --> 05:34.208
You'll win them over, eventually.

05:36.834 --> 05:39.125
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

05:40.542 --> 05:41.917
Thank you.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.333
Now, nothing elaborate.

05:44.417 --> 05:47.625
Just a simple roast and
something appropriate to go with it.

05:47.709 --> 05:50.959
Right. Like an ambulance.

05:58.834 --> 06:01.667
Amy, small steps, small.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.667
Little Miss Snowflake glides,
she doesn't stomp.

06:04.750 --> 06:08.125
- Is that better?
- Getting there, sweetie.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.959
If she was a horse,
we'd have to shoot her.

06:12.583 --> 06:16.125
- Poor thing. She tries so hard.
- Yeah, she's a trouper.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.250
- Let's dump her.
- What? Why?

06:18.333 --> 06:21.333
Pageant consultants are judged
on the strength of their roster.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.750
You know, we can't afford to bounce
every nose-picking no-talent,

06:23.834 --> 06:25.125
but we can definitely lose the one

06:25.208 --> 06:26.500
who's dragging us down,
and that's Amy.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.834
We can't do that.
Her mother died last year.

06:28.917 --> 06:32.542
Yes, I know. I know and it's tragic,
but we are running a business.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.875
Amy is sucking up all of our time
and we should be focusing on Sherri.

06:35.959 --> 06:38.583
She actually has a shot at winning.

06:39.417 --> 06:40.625
How will I tell her family?

06:40.709 --> 06:43.000
We'll do it together.
We'll be very diplomatic.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.250
Are you sure about this?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.208
The poor kid's
been through the wringer.

06:46.291 --> 06:48.125
Amy! For God sakes!

06:48.208 --> 06:51.709
Little Miss Snowflake
does not scratch down there!

06:51.792 --> 06:53.792
Well, then again,
her mother died a year ago.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.041
How long is she gonna milk it?

06:58.375 --> 07:00.792
Mother Hodge, I have your breakfast.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.208
Just put it over there.
I'll pick through it later.

07:03.291 --> 07:04.959
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

07:05.041 --> 07:06.875
<i>Oh, wait, wait, wait.</i>

07:06.959 --> 07:09.792
- What are you watching?
- Home movies.

07:10.875 --> 07:14.250
It's fun looking
back at the past, isn't it?

07:14.333 --> 07:18.208
Well, it's one way to kill time
while you're waiting for death.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.166
We also have cable.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.750
Have you decided
what you're gonna do about Orson?

07:24.834 --> 07:26.625
- Decided?
- Yes.

07:26.709 --> 07:30.166
- Have you called a lawyer yet?
- I don't think that's any of your concern.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.875
I don't mean to pry, but I think
you're a good Christian woman,

07:34.959 --> 07:37.667
and you deserve better than my son.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.750
Well, I will take that under advisement.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.542
If you give him a chance
he'll draw you back in.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.375
It's what he does.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.792
Just walk away.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.709
It's not that easy. I love him.

07:51.417 --> 07:53.417
You'll get over it.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.875
I did.

07:57.542 --> 07:58.875
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi.

08:03.041 --> 08:06.125
<i>- Merry Christmas!</i>
- Hello.

08:06.208 --> 08:07.959
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

08:08.041 --> 08:09.959
<i>Oh, wait, wait, wait.</i>

08:11.792 --> 08:15.500
Well, believe me, Rita,
he scares me, too.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.250
You know what?
We should have a meeting.

08:17.333 --> 08:21.333
Get all the moms together and
figure out what to do about this guy.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.125
Saturday, your house, sounds good.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.041
Hey, Rita, I gotta go.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.000
Sorry, I can't talk now.
I have somewhere to go.

08:39.083 --> 08:43.291
Well, my brother doesn't.
The youth centre just fired him.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.667
- Are you happy?
- I'm not sad.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.166
He shouldn't be around kids.
I saw those pictures.

08:49.250 --> 08:53.834
Those boys were on his swim team.
He was proud of them.

08:53.917 --> 08:57.375
Turning that into something dirty
says more about you than him.

08:57.458 --> 09:00.959
You can defend him all you want.
I know what I know.

09:04.917 --> 09:09.208
Did you know my brother got spit on
at the hardware store yesterday?

09:10.208 --> 09:13.625
That they refused to serve us
at the diner?

09:13.709 --> 09:17.208
That our tyre got slashed
at the church parking lot?

09:20.792 --> 09:24.291
I am not a well woman.
I don't need this stress.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.959
Well, I am sorry that happened.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.875
Have you considered,
even for a moment,

09:32.959 --> 09:34.375
that you could be wrong?

09:34.458 --> 09:36.458
That you misinterpreted what you saw?

09:36.542 --> 09:41.750
That you are ruining my brother's life,
and mine, over nothing?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.625
I have kids, okay?

09:46.709 --> 09:48.750
Better safe than sorry.

09:49.917 --> 09:53.083
As long as you're safe,
what do you care who's sorry?

10:07.834 --> 10:11.083
So, I'm cooking dinner
for Ian's parents tomorrow night,

10:11.166 --> 10:15.458
and it's the first time I'm meeting them,
so I sort of want to impress them.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.041
And yet you're cooking?

10:17.125 --> 10:18.834
Well, that's the thing.

10:18.917 --> 10:22.083
So I was hoping, you know,
if you're not too busy...

10:22.166 --> 10:25.542
Oh, no, no. These things
practically build themselves.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.667
Thank you. You are a lifesaver.

10:27.750 --> 10:31.583
Actually, I could probably
use the distraction.

10:33.750 --> 10:34.875
Oh?

10:36.041 --> 10:38.709
I asked Orson to move out last night.

10:41.417 --> 10:44.291
Oh, come on. Why would you bury
your toolbox in the woods?

10:44.375 --> 10:47.333
I knew the cops were looking for it
and I panicked.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.959
I was just trying
to buy myself some time.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.959
Well, you may have
bought yourself 20-to-life.

10:51.041 --> 10:54.291
- Let the guy enjoy his breakfast.
- Stay out of this, Carlos.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.417
Mike, I want you to look at me.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.875
Now, you look me in the eye
and you swear to me

10:58.959 --> 11:00.500
that you didn't kill anybody.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.458
How many times do I have to tell you?
I can't remember.

11:03.542 --> 11:06.208
You can't remember,
or you don't want to remember?

11:06.291 --> 11:07.667
Guys?

11:20.208 --> 11:22.417
Bree, you have got to go
to the police with all of this.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.375
I can't. Not yet.
I need some time to think.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.125
His wife goes missing,
then his mistress turns up dead?

11:28.208 --> 11:30.542
What is there to think about?

11:32.667 --> 11:35.792
I know it sounds suspicious,
but in my heart of hearts,

11:35.875 --> 11:38.166
I just can't believe
that Orson could do such a thing.

11:38.250 --> 11:41.458
Sweetie, we all want to believe
the best of the people we care about.

11:41.542 --> 11:46.166
But you cannot let your feelings
for a man blind you to cold, hard facts.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.542
What in the world...

11:54.125 --> 11:55.667
Oh, my God!

11:58.959 --> 12:02.458
- What's going on?
- They just arrested Mike for murder.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.667
What?

12:03.750 --> 12:08.166
They're saying he killed that woman
on the news, that Monique person.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.625
Oh, thank God.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.583
I can't believe we're gonna break
that little girl's heart.

12:15.667 --> 12:16.917
Do not wimp out on me here.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.375
We've gotta do
what's best for the business.

12:18.458 --> 12:21.000
- What if her father yells at me?
- Then I will jump in and defend you.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.208
Okay, but if you do,
try and be diplomatic.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.417
I'm always diplomatic.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.166
Now just get in there,
you spineless 'mo.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.792
Excuse me, Mr Pearce?

12:32.291 --> 12:35.959
I'm so glad you could come today.
This is my partner, Gabrielle.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.083
Pleasure to meet you.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.458
Shall we?

12:43.792 --> 12:46.834
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

12:46.917 --> 12:49.917
- Is there a problem with Amy?
- Not a problem, per se.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.333
We're just a little concerned

12:51.417 --> 12:56.000
that she might not have the
temperament for pageant competitions.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.375
And what does that mean?

12:57.458 --> 13:01.375
Well, when it comes to performing,
she's not exactly...

13:04.333 --> 13:07.417
Well, she tends to be...
Feel free to jump in.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.500
I have no idea
where you're going with this.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.709
Well, as Gabby and I discussed,
Amy has certain limitations.

13:17.792 --> 13:20.917
- Her odds of winning are slim.
- Vern!

13:21.000 --> 13:22.250
He is so competitive.

13:22.333 --> 13:26.000
I constantly have to remind him,
they're just kids.

13:26.083 --> 13:29.000
- When did you lose the joy?
- Oh, I think you know.

13:29.083 --> 13:32.166
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you dumping Amy?

13:32.250 --> 13:34.583
Of course not, Bill.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.959
Can I call you Bill?

13:37.041 --> 13:40.834
It's just we feel that Amy would benefit
from some private coaching.

13:40.917 --> 13:44.625
Maybe I could come to your house?
Say, Friday, 5:00?

13:46.834 --> 13:50.625
- Sure. Yeah, I guess.
- Great. It's a date.

13:51.917 --> 13:54.125
Maybe I should come, too.

13:54.208 --> 13:58.125
After the harsh things you said
about Amy, I don't think so.

14:01.041 --> 14:05.291
I'm gonna need a good lawyer,
and that may take a little research.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.291
And whoever takes my case
will need a retainer.

14:07.375 --> 14:10.542
So if you don't mind,
I promise I'll pay you back.

14:10.625 --> 14:12.500
Oh, okay.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.333
And make sure
he knows about my wrench.

14:14.417 --> 14:18.709
Apparently, they tested it and
found traces of this Monique's blood.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.583
What's wrong?

14:23.959 --> 14:28.000
I don't know if
you've picked up on this, Mike,

14:28.083 --> 14:30.166
but I haven't been happy.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.291
No, I didn't pick up on it.

14:33.375 --> 14:35.250
Well, I wanted to tell you this
weeks ago,

14:35.333 --> 14:37.542
and I wish that I had, because
now I know you're gonna think

14:37.625 --> 14:40.375
that I'm breaking up with you
over this whole blood-on-the-axe thing.

14:40.458 --> 14:43.000
- Wrench.
- Whatever.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.333
But believe me, that's not it.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.417
It's just

14:49.667 --> 14:51.959
we are moving too fast.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.417
What are you trying to say?

14:55.500 --> 14:58.458
Well, maybe we should
just take a break.

14:58.542 --> 15:01.125
You know, date other people.

15:02.750 --> 15:06.750
You're telling me this on the day
I'm put in a men's prison?

15:06.834 --> 15:09.250
Well, I said the timing was bad.

15:11.709 --> 15:15.750
I am sorry. I really am.

15:15.834 --> 15:18.500
I just can't do this.

15:36.792 --> 15:40.792
They told me somebody was coming,
but I did not expect it to be you.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.458
Is Edie getting you a good lawyer?

15:44.250 --> 15:46.792
I doubt it. She dumped me today.

15:47.542 --> 15:50.875
- What? Why?
- Well, I was arrested for murder.

15:51.625 --> 15:52.875
Still.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.625
It's tacky.

15:57.417 --> 15:58.875
Okay, then.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.291
I'll help get you out.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.625
What's your bail?

16:08.250 --> 16:09.667
$1 million.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.125
Oh.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.583
You don't have to help me, Susan.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.709
I want to.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.542
Aren't you gonna ask?

16:25.625 --> 16:26.792
What?

16:27.750 --> 16:29.792
If I killed that woman.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.583
I don't have to. I know you didn't.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.083
I wish I was that sure.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.792
I have these flashes
where I see her face,

16:47.875 --> 16:49.625
so I must have known her.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.125
What if I did?
Maybe something happened.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.667
Maybe I got angry. Maybe...

16:52.750 --> 16:56.875
There's an explanation for this,
and we're gonna figure it out.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.500
Don't worry about a thing.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.750
Miss Gabrielle, when are you
gonna come outside and watch me?

17:12.834 --> 17:16.000
Oh, the grass, honey,
and my allergies.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.166
Go ahead and practise.
I'll watch you from here.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.125
Are you sure I can't help with anything?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.166
No, I've been a single dad
for a while now.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.834
I got the dinner thing down.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.959
I've got the restaurant thing down.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.750
I can't bring myself to cook for one.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.041
Not that I ever cooked for two.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.959
Well, no restaurant tonight.
You are having dinner with us.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.500
Oh, that's sweet.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.792
It's the least I can do
to thank you for helping Amy.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.583
Oh, it's nothing.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.583
Yeah, she's a special girl.

17:54.583 --> 17:59.333
So, how is it for you,
being single again?

18:00.458 --> 18:02.583
Oh, honestly,

18:04.458 --> 18:05.625
I hate it.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.834
- It's like I've forgotten how to date.
- Me, too.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.583
You know, I even let a friend of mine
talk me into

18:09.667 --> 18:11.166
one of those speed-dating things.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.875
- How was it?
- I didn't even go in.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.375
I just sat in this hotel lobby,

18:15.458 --> 18:19.000
I watched all these lonely,
desperate single people filing in,

18:19.083 --> 18:21.709
and then it hit me, I'm one of them.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.458
I know what you mean.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.709
Did you see that?
It spun three times and then I caught it!

18:31.875 --> 18:34.709
- You didn't see.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, sweetie.

18:34.792 --> 18:38.291
- I was distracting Gabrielle.
- Oh, no, no, it's totally my fault.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.542
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Go outside and do it again.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.417
I promise, this time we're gonna watch.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.792
Come in.

19:02.291 --> 19:05.500
Hey. Wow. Oh, those are gorgeous.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.542
Well, I figured
you'd be too busy cooking

19:07.625 --> 19:09.542
to manage a centrepiece.

19:10.709 --> 19:15.583
Well, you may not be a good cook,
but you're certainly a tidy one.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.625
Don't worry. Dinner's all taken care of.

19:17.709 --> 19:21.875
We're having blanquette de veau
and a Grand Marnier soufflé.

19:21.959 --> 19:26.583
Well, that's very ambitious of you.
And when will Bree be done making it?

19:27.375 --> 19:28.709
5.30.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.542
But I am re-warming it all by myself.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.792
Oh, what's all this?

19:34.875 --> 19:38.583
- Mike was arrested for murder.
- My God.

19:38.667 --> 19:42.875
I mean, of course he's totally innocent.
I'm just trying to help him find a lawyer.

19:42.959 --> 19:46.458
Oh. Shouldn't his girlfriend
be doing that?

19:46.542 --> 19:48.542
Yeah. Edie dumped him.

19:52.417 --> 19:56.709
Okay, I know how this looks,
but I just feel bad.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.667
He's just a friend now.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.917
Yes, yes, a friend
you sat by for six months,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.709
hoping he'd wake up
and ravish you again.

20:05.792 --> 20:09.792
You are the only one
allowed to ravish me these days.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.583
So stop worrying.

20:17.291 --> 20:21.583
Orson, it's me again.
Please call. We need to talk.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.875
You always do the chips.
I think you're stealing money.

20:24.959 --> 20:28.208
- Well, I'll do the chips, you deal.
- You got it.

20:29.917 --> 20:32.625
Guys, why has it been so long
since we played poker?

20:32.709 --> 20:34.500
- I really need this.
- Oh, me too.

20:34.583 --> 20:39.375
There's nothing more relaxing than
an afternoon of finger food and girl talk.

20:39.458 --> 20:42.792
- Hi, ladies.
- Hey, how are you doing?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.792
So did you tell the police
that you think Orson killed Monique?

20:45.875 --> 20:48.875
- What?
- No, I did not.

20:48.959 --> 20:51.333
- And I don't plan to.
- But Mike is in jail.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.667
And you said yourself
you thought Orson did it.

20:53.750 --> 20:54.834
I said I had concerns,

20:54.917 --> 20:58.583
concerns that have disappeared
now that Mike has been arrested.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.792
What are you saying?
You think Mike is guilty?

21:00.875 --> 21:02.542
Hey, why don't we start that girl talk?

21:02.625 --> 21:06.625
I'll get the ball rolling.
Anybody have a yeast infection?

21:06.709 --> 21:08.333
They found Monique's blood
on the wrench

21:08.417 --> 21:10.500
that Mike was trying to dispose of.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.583
I mean, that hardly
screams "innocence."

21:12.667 --> 21:14.417
Her teeth were pulled!

21:14.500 --> 21:16.333
You don't think
that's worth telling the cops,

21:16.417 --> 21:18.333
she was messing around
with a dentist?

21:18.417 --> 21:20.500
Orson was slipping it
to the dead chick?

21:20.583 --> 21:23.166
Mike is innocent.
I know that in my heart.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.709
We all have convictions, Susan.

21:24.792 --> 21:27.250
I believe Mike's last one
was for manslaughter.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.041
Okay, okay, we've all made
some excellent points

21:30.125 --> 21:32.750
and blown off a little steam.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.542
Let's play some cards.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.875
If you're so sure that Orson is innocent,
why don't we go through his things?

21:38.959 --> 21:41.166
- Where's his desk?
- At his office.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.000
What did you think
you'd find there, anyway?

21:43.083 --> 21:46.667
I don't know. A blackmail letter?
A necklace made of teeth?

21:46.750 --> 21:49.375
- We're not gonna play cards, are we?
- Nope.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.125
Well, I'm certainly
not playing with a woman

21:51.208 --> 21:53.792
that is willing to let Mike take the fall
for her psycho husband.

21:53.875 --> 21:56.834
Well, needless to say, I won't be
cooking dinner for Ian's parents.

21:56.917 --> 22:00.083
- Fine. I'll cook myself.
- Good.

22:00.166 --> 22:01.792
Let me know if there are any survivors.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.917
And if you take Orson back,
you do the same.

22:11.583 --> 22:16.500
Well, that was incredibly awkward.
I'm sorry you both had to sit through it.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.875
Was it me? Was I out of line?

22:18.959 --> 22:22.000
- No way I'm taking sides.
- This'll blow over.

22:22.083 --> 22:24.083
- Yeah, right.
- I hope so.

22:24.166 --> 22:26.750
Bree, you can't bet
until you get all of your cards.

22:39.375 --> 22:42.166
- Hey, come on in, you're just in time.
- Thanks so much, Rita.

22:42.250 --> 22:46.709
I think it's such a good idea
that we all get together and talk, and...

22:46.792 --> 22:50.709
Wow! Wow! What is all this?

22:50.792 --> 22:54.500
Oh, we decided to stage a protest
in front of Art's house.

22:54.625 --> 22:55.917
A protest?

22:56.041 --> 22:59.458
Rita, I want the word "paedophile"
to really stand out.

22:59.542 --> 23:00.834
Do we have any glitter?

23:01.208 --> 23:04.083
Say "molester." It sounds scarier.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.291
I'm sorry.

23:05.375 --> 23:10.041
I thought we were all gonna talk about
how to keep an eye on this guy.

23:10.125 --> 23:12.083
We're past talking.
The guy's a menace.

23:12.166 --> 23:15.500
Well, that's what we think,
but we don't exactly have proof.

23:15.583 --> 23:19.083
The youth centre just fired him.
How much proof do you need?

23:19.166 --> 23:22.917
But, see, the only reason they fired him
is because people were gossiping.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.667
And the only reason they're gossiping

23:24.750 --> 23:27.375
is because of what
I told Mrs McCluskey.

23:27.458 --> 23:30.000
Yeah, and you told me
to spread the word.

23:30.083 --> 23:33.417
So that people could
watch their kids and be vigilant.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.333
So you wanna wait until
he actually molests one of our kids?

23:36.417 --> 23:38.875
- Whose side are you on, Lynette?
- Knock it off, Gert.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.250
Remember, if it weren't for Lynette,

23:41.333 --> 23:44.625
we never would have found out
about this creep.

23:44.709 --> 23:46.500
She's our hero.

24:40.834 --> 24:42.417
<i>...at their 42-yard line.</i>

24:42.500 --> 24:46.458
<i>The give to Harris, who is hit</i>
<i>immediately and dropped for a loss...</i>

24:51.083 --> 24:53.959
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- See you, sweetie. Have fun.

24:54.041 --> 24:56.166
So, I was thinking,

24:56.250 --> 24:59.333
you wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something after class?

24:59.417 --> 25:02.667
I'd love to grab a cup of coffee
or something.

25:07.417 --> 25:11.750
Oh, Amy, you are so lucky
to have such a nice dad.

25:12.583 --> 25:13.959
Yeah, I know.

25:15.542 --> 25:17.417
Leave him alone.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.875
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

25:19.959 --> 25:22.250
I don't want you dating him.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.959
Oh, sweetheart.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.750
I have a feeling
I know what this is about.

25:29.834 --> 25:32.125
- No, you don't.
- I think I do.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.709
You miss your mommy.

25:33.792 --> 25:37.500
And it feels funny seeing your daddy
be nice to somebody else.

25:37.583 --> 25:41.083
But believe me,
I'm not trying to replace your mom.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.125
Well, I am.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.250
And I have someone all picked out.

25:47.333 --> 25:51.208
- What?
- I want my dad to marry Sherri's mom.

25:53.041 --> 25:54.333
Sherri from class?

25:54.417 --> 25:56.542
We're best friends,
and we have it all planned out.

25:56.625 --> 26:00.166
Our parents are gonna get married,
and then we'll be real sisters.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.333
What about your dad?
Don't you care what he wants?

26:02.417 --> 26:04.250
My mom died.

26:04.333 --> 26:07.250
All my dad wants is for me to be happy.

26:08.291 --> 26:11.917
Now, get in there and teach me
how to work the runway.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.959
That's what we're paying you for, right?

26:21.542 --> 26:24.125
<i>...fights his way to the 25</i>
<i>for another first down,</i>

26:24.208 --> 26:25.792
<i>and that should just about do it.</i>

26:25.875 --> 26:29.792
<i>I tell you, with 1:12 left on the clock</i>
<i>with no timeouts remaining...</i>

26:55.333 --> 26:56.458
Orson?

26:59.208 --> 27:01.291
- Bree?
- Orson.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.625
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls?

27:05.709 --> 27:09.667
I was afraid you were calling
to ask me for a divorce.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.333
No, I wasn't.

27:12.625 --> 27:15.625
They arrested Mike
for the murder of Monique Polier.

27:15.709 --> 27:17.125
They did?

27:17.208 --> 27:19.750
The other night you wanted a chance
to explain everything.

27:19.834 --> 27:22.625
Well, here it is, and I want it all.

27:22.709 --> 27:27.792
If I find out you've left anything out,
then I will ask for that divorce.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.125
Okay.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.750
You're working so hard, Sherri.

27:50.834 --> 27:53.166
You must really want
to win this pageant.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.875
- More than anything.
- Oh.

27:55.959 --> 27:58.333
Well, I think dedication
should be rewarded.

27:58.417 --> 28:01.166
- So I have a little surprise for you.
- What is it?

28:01.250 --> 28:04.250
Well, you know how the pageant
starts with a big opening number?

28:04.333 --> 28:07.041
This year, all the contestants
are gonna dance in pairs.

28:07.125 --> 28:11.250
And I've arranged for you
to dance with your best friend, Amy!

28:14.959 --> 28:18.000
- What's wrong, sweetie?
- Well...

28:19.208 --> 28:20.959
Amy sucks.

28:23.375 --> 28:27.375
Well, I thought you two
were practically sisters.

28:27.458 --> 28:30.542
We are, but she still sucks.

28:30.625 --> 28:34.083
And first impressions are everything.
You said so yourself.

28:34.166 --> 28:37.125
- Well, that's true.
- And this is the opening number.

28:37.208 --> 28:39.250
If the judges see me
tripping all over that klutz,

28:39.333 --> 28:41.375
there's no way I'm gonna win.

28:41.458 --> 28:45.000
That's a good point.
Now I wish I hadn't told Amy.

28:45.083 --> 28:49.667
- You already told her?
- She was so excited.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.959
Well, she's your best friend.

28:54.041 --> 28:57.500
Why don't you just tell her the truth?
She'll understand.

28:57.583 --> 28:59.417
What if she doesn't?

29:00.291 --> 29:02.709
Well, friends come and go,

29:03.625 --> 29:06.000
but a crown is forever.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.542
I never loved Alma.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.041
My mother pushed us together,

29:16.125 --> 29:18.750
and I was stupid enough
to get her pregnant.

29:18.834 --> 29:20.458
You had a child?

29:21.375 --> 29:24.166
Alma miscarried
a month after the wedding.

29:25.041 --> 29:28.250
- I was trapped.
- Well, you could have left her.

29:28.333 --> 29:32.083
Mother wouldn't hear of it.
Divorce is a sin.

29:34.625 --> 29:37.041
So I stayed in the marriage,

29:37.125 --> 29:40.583
hoping I would come to feel
what I was supposed to.

29:41.709 --> 29:43.041
I never did.

29:43.125 --> 29:45.917
So I resigned myself
to a life without love.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.375
And then I met Monique.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.125
It was wrong. I didn't care.

29:55.709 --> 29:59.625
I loved her more than I'd loved anyone,
until you.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.834
So why couldn't you tell me this?

30:03.667 --> 30:05.250
Because you told me about Rex,

30:05.333 --> 30:07.500
how he cheated on you,
how hurt you were.

30:07.583 --> 30:10.667
Bree, I needed you to feel safe with me.

30:25.875 --> 30:29.083
So you stayed in a loveless marriage
because of your mother?

30:29.166 --> 30:31.250
I know how it sounds.

30:31.917 --> 30:35.583
But after my father died,
she was all I had.

30:36.166 --> 30:39.291
His death caused me to suffer
in a way that...

30:44.792 --> 30:47.000
I would have done anything for her.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.458
She saw that weakness
and she ran with it.

31:03.917 --> 31:07.041
You've got no idea
how manipulative she can be.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.333
She ruins lives.

31:13.125 --> 31:15.250
I've told you everything.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.959
What happens now?

31:19.083 --> 31:23.750
Well, first you pack up your things
and come home,

31:25.333 --> 31:30.083
and then we toss your mother out
on her evil ass.

31:30.959 --> 31:32.625
God, I love you.

31:54.125 --> 31:57.917
Hi! I'm so sorry I'm late!
Where are your folks?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.875
They're not coming.
Their plane was snowed in at O'Hare.

32:00.959 --> 32:03.333
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

32:03.417 --> 32:06.166
Well, no harm done, then, huh?

32:06.250 --> 32:09.291
- You're 40 minutes late.
- But they're not here.

32:09.375 --> 32:12.583
You didn't know that.
And where's dinner?

32:12.667 --> 32:15.041
Bree and I sort of had a fight.

32:16.500 --> 32:20.750
Look, I'm awfully sorry that I'm late.
I had an emergency.

32:20.834 --> 32:24.125
Did this emergency
have anything to do with Mike?

32:29.750 --> 32:31.667
I'm pretty sure that Bree's husband

32:31.750 --> 32:35.208
murdered the woman
the cops think Mike killed.

32:35.291 --> 32:38.333
- I went to his office...
- Oh, for God's sake, Susan.

32:38.417 --> 32:41.166
Ian, I found evidence. Look.

32:41.250 --> 32:45.333
Orson was committed to a
mental institution for over a year.

32:45.417 --> 32:47.333
I mean, doesn't that suggest
he's some sort of...

32:47.417 --> 32:48.667
I don't care!

32:50.458 --> 32:53.625
Tonight meant a great deal to me
and you blew it off.

32:54.333 --> 32:56.250
I said I was sorry, Ian.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.291
I have to help Mike. I'm all he's got.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.375
Actually, you're wrong. He's got me.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.542
What?

33:10.625 --> 33:13.333
Tomorrow I'll hire the best lawyer
in town to defend him,

33:13.417 --> 33:15.709
and I'll pay every cent of his bill.

33:17.041 --> 33:20.208
- You would do that for Mike?
- Yes.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.041
On one condition.

33:25.875 --> 33:27.917
You can't see him any more.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.083
Why?

33:30.166 --> 33:32.458
If you start visiting him,
being a friend to him,

33:32.542 --> 33:33.792
he'll fall in love with you again.

33:33.875 --> 33:37.750
Then you'll have to decide
whose heart to break, his or mine.

33:39.625 --> 33:43.375
As jealous ultimatums go,
that's very flattering,

33:43.458 --> 33:47.041
but I don't think that's necessary.
Mike and I are done.

33:47.125 --> 33:51.000
Then you should have no problem
accepting my generous offer.

33:51.709 --> 33:53.875
You would really get him
the best lawyer in town?

33:53.959 --> 33:55.834
An absolute piranha.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.875
Do we have a deal?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.917
Well, okay, then.

34:12.166 --> 34:14.500
You know, Mike barely remembers me.

34:15.667 --> 34:19.250
What makes you so sure
he would fall in love with me again?

34:21.208 --> 34:24.250
What a perfectly asinine question.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.041
How could he not?

34:38.917 --> 34:42.250
God, I was only in the house
15 minutes.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.625
- Are there more of them now?
- Yep.

34:44.709 --> 34:47.291
We don't want you
in our neighbourhood!

34:47.917 --> 34:49.917
Go ahead, say it. I know you want to.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.959
This is all your fault.
You should have listened to me.

34:53.041 --> 34:54.542
I know.

34:55.291 --> 34:59.417
But be fair, there is no way
I could have anticipated this.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.625
You tell people
Frankenstein's on the loose,

35:01.709 --> 35:05.125
then you're surprised
to see the torch-wielding villagers?

35:07.250 --> 35:11.458
I'm putting the kids to bed early.
I don't want them to see this.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.166
Is that an ambulance?

35:17.291 --> 35:18.875
I can't believe you're doing this!

35:18.959 --> 35:21.417
Amy, don't you want me
to have a chance?

35:21.500 --> 35:23.959
God, I hate you! I hate you!

35:26.333 --> 35:28.667
Don't ever talk to me again!

35:31.542 --> 35:33.375
Hi, Bill?

35:33.458 --> 35:36.542
I was wondering,
do you have plans Saturday night?

35:43.667 --> 35:45.792
Excuse me, can you tell me
what happened here?

35:45.875 --> 35:48.083
- Ma'am, I need you to step back.
- Okay.

35:48.166 --> 35:50.250
We're bringing in a female, late 30s.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.291
Get a crash cart ready.
She's in cardiac arrest.

36:02.875 --> 36:04.333
There he is!

36:12.625 --> 36:14.083
Stay out of here! Stay out!

36:14.166 --> 36:16.083
Stop it! Stop it!

36:16.166 --> 36:19.959
You can't do this to people.
Have you lost your minds?

36:20.041 --> 36:22.375
Well excuse us for wanting
to feel safe in our own homes.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.792
Well, that's my home
and I don't feel very safe right now.

36:24.875 --> 36:28.375
Please, please, all of you,
just leave this street.

36:28.458 --> 36:30.583
Please! I beg of you, go!

36:31.792 --> 36:36.208
Get off my street, please!
Wait! Wait, Art! Wait!

36:40.542 --> 36:42.083
I'm sorry.

37:02.083 --> 37:04.834
You're an idiot to take him back.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.166
I am no longer interested
in your opinion.

37:07.250 --> 37:09.000
I thought I made that clear.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.208
Where are you sending me?

37:10.291 --> 37:13.875
Oh, we've rented you a condo
in a lovely retirement community.

37:13.959 --> 37:15.750
It's our Christmas gift to you.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.709
So you're exiling me?

37:17.792 --> 37:20.291
Cutting me off
from my new grandchildren?

37:20.375 --> 37:22.458
That's our gift to them.

37:28.375 --> 37:30.834
You think you can be rid of me
that easily?

37:30.917 --> 37:33.458
It's over, Mother. I told her everything.

37:33.542 --> 37:36.959
Oh, I doubt that very much.

37:37.041 --> 37:40.917
- You still have secrets, my boy.
- So do you, Mother.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.250
And if you want them kept,
you'll keep mine.

37:56.959 --> 38:00.375
It's me. I have some bad news.
She's taking him back.

38:01.583 --> 38:05.542
Meet me on the corner in an hour.
We need to deal with this.

38:16.041 --> 38:18.917
Hi, I heard about Rebecca on the news.

38:20.041 --> 38:23.750
If there's anything I can do to help,

38:23.834 --> 38:25.583
with funeral arrangements,

38:25.667 --> 38:29.333
or help you call relatives...

38:30.792 --> 38:31.959
Wow.

38:33.917 --> 38:36.875
- You must be feeling really guilty.
- Oh.

38:37.917 --> 38:43.375
Of course. I feel just terrible.

38:43.458 --> 38:48.041
If you knew, if you could just know
how sorry I am.

38:58.792 --> 38:59.917
Hey!

39:01.750 --> 39:03.875
You know, in a weird way,

39:05.667 --> 39:07.125
I should thank you.

39:10.375 --> 39:15.041
My sister was
a really wonderful person.

39:17.667 --> 39:20.041
She always saw the best in me.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.333
But there are things she couldn't see.

39:26.750 --> 39:29.125
Or chose not to, God love her.

39:34.959 --> 39:37.375
- What do you mean?
- I think you know.

39:38.834 --> 39:42.375
See, I always knew that
I had to take care of Rebecca.

39:42.458 --> 39:46.625
So I could never let myself slip

39:46.709 --> 39:49.875
and do something that would hurt her.

39:49.959 --> 39:51.291
But now,

39:54.375 --> 39:55.834
I'm free.

39:58.208 --> 40:00.250
And all because of you.

40:09.125 --> 40:13.000
- You can't stay here.
- Oh, don't worry. I'm already packed.

40:14.750 --> 40:18.166
- Where are you going?
- Why? You gonna write?

40:22.750 --> 40:24.041
Well,

40:26.583 --> 40:28.125
goodbye, Lynette.

40:31.125 --> 40:34.917
You take care of that
beautiful family of yours.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
<i>There is a reason</i>
<i>people can't wait for Christmas,</i>

41:14.333 --> 41:17.709
<i>and it has little to do</i>
<i>with family reunions,</i>

41:21.125 --> 41:24.458
<i>or curling up with a cup of eggnog,</i>

41:30.166 --> 41:34.750
<i>or that unexpected kiss</i>

41:38.750 --> 41:43.166

<i>from that special someone.</i>

41:51.000 --> 41:52.291
<i>No.</i>

41:52.375 --> 41:54.792
<i>People look forward to Christmas</i>

41:55.917 --> 41:57.500

41:58.375 --> 41:59.834
<i>it's a time</i>

42:02.083 --> 42:03.792

42:04.500 --> 42:06.291
Hello, Alma.

42:06.375 --> 42:09.375
Don't just stand there.
Tell me everything.
