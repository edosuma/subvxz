Hello.
I'm R.L. Stine.

00:07.733 --> 00:10.233
I write the Goosebumps books.

00:10.233 --> 00:14.233
Welcome to dead house. I think
you're going to like your new house.

00:14.233 --> 00:18.733
But before you move in, I have
a few words of warning for you.

00:18.733 --> 00:21.233
Better look under the bed at night...

00:21.233 --> 00:23.233
before you go to sleep.

00:23.233 --> 00:25.233
And when you make new friends,

00:25.233 --> 00:29.233
always check to see
who's dead and who's alive.

00:29.233 --> 00:33.033

You're in for a scare.

And the weather for Dark Falls,

00:56.133 --> 00:59.033
scattered thunderstorms tonight
followed by more rain tomorrow,

00:59.033 --> 01:01.433
with a chance of clearing
in the afternoon.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.833
That's a chance of sunshine
in the afternoon.

01:04.233 --> 01:08.400
[ Boy ] Dark Falls?
I don't wanna live in Dark Falls.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.900
[ Woman ] Then I don't know
where you're gonna live.

[ Boy ]
But it's not fair!

01:12.833 --> 01:15.800
[ Man ] Josh, do you know how lucky
we are to have found this house?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.333
[ Josh ] I don't care.
I don't wanna move.

01:18.033 --> 01:21.533
Dark Falls.
What a dumb name for a town.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.900
- [ Sighs ]
- I think it's charming and evocative.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.900
[ Man ]
I thought you loved small towns, Josh.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.900
Whenever we passed through
small towns on vacations,

01:29.900 --> 01:31.833
you used to say,
"Why can't we live there?"

01:31.833 --> 01:34.267
That was when
I didn't know any better.

01:36.233 --> 01:39.233
[ Man ]
The real estate agent did admit...

01:39.233 --> 01:42.067
this town had lost some jobs recently.

01:42.567 --> 01:45.033
Great. We're moving to a
place that's totally dead.

01:45.033 --> 01:47.533
[ Woman ]
That's why we got the house so cheap.

01:48.033 --> 01:50.967
And fortunately, all your father needs to
make a living is a room with a computer.

01:50.967 --> 01:54.400
- I don't even need a room.
- I liked it where we were.

01:54.900 --> 01:58.267
Look at Amanda, Josh.
You don't see her making a big fuss.

01:58.267 --> 02:00.733
She wants to move here.
Don't you, Amanda?

02:00.733 --> 02:02.133
Not really.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.633
Come on, everybody.

02:04.633 --> 02:07.633
It's an adventure.
And wait till you see the house.

02:07.633 --> 02:09.633
It's really something.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.967
[ Josh ]
It's really something, all right.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.900
Something ugly!

02:28.400 --> 02:30.400
It won't be after we fix it up.

- [ Continues Barking ]
- [ Mom ] You saw someone upstairs?

03:12.367 --> 03:16.267
I saw the curtains move.
It must have been the wind, I guess.

03:16.267 --> 03:17.267
It's an old house.

03:17.767 --> 03:20.767
There'll be lots of cracks
and holes we have to patch up.

came down here last month.

- Where was he?

05:57.733 --> 06:01.567
He was in another room
sniffing at a closet door.

- Oh, that dog!

We made it in good time--
About nine hours.

- Come downstairs, Mr. Dawes.
- Compton. I insist.

06:18.133 --> 06:22.133

Honey, I thought we threw that out.

06:41.267 --> 06:44.200
I would never throw this out.
This wreath is a good-luck charm.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.567
- Looks like garbage.
- It's an antique.

06:47.567 --> 06:52.433
It's been passed down from
generation to generation in my family.

06:52.933 --> 06:53.933
I've never seen it.

06:53.933 --> 06:56.900
Because your father wouldn't
let me hang it in the old house.

- Thought we threw it out.
- Well, we didn't.

07:01.267 --> 07:04.700

17:29.600 --> 17:32.333
- Dead?
- But she wasn't.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.767
- Like a ghost?
- No. I don't know. I can't explain it.

17:34.767 --> 17:38.233
[ Mom ] I think you had
a bad dream, sweetheart.

17:38.233 --> 17:41.067
- No, I didn't. I saw her.
- [ Growling ]

17:41.067 --> 17:44.433
Her face, it was--
It was horrible!

17:44.433 --> 17:45.967
- [ Petey Barking ]
- Told you this place stinks.

17:45.967 --> 17:49.267
- [ Petey Growling ]
- Your first few nights in a strange house--

17:49.267 --> 17:52.633
I'm not surprised
you had a nightmare.

17:52.633 --> 17:56.500
- But I was awake, Mom.
- I've had bad dreams like that.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.400
Dreams that seemed so real
you could've sworn they happened.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.833
There's a hole in the wall, and the
wind whistles right through here.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.333
You must have heard the wind whistling
and it made you have a dream.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.733
No, I-- I saw her.

18:08.733 --> 18:12.233
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll patch
that hole tomorrow. It'll be fine.

18:12.233 --> 18:15.733
I'll stay with her
until she falls asleep.

18:15.733 --> 18:18.233
Everyone else, back to bed.

18:18.233 --> 18:20.233
We never should have moved.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.167
And that's all I'm gonna say.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.667
Come on, Josh.
Let's go.

18:26.667 --> 18:30.167
Close your eyes, sweetheart.
I'll be right here.

18:45.567 --> 18:48.067
That oughta keep
the boogey man out.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.567
Or boogey girl.

[ Chuckles ]
It was a joke, honey.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.400
I know.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.400
You're not liking it here,
are you?

18:57.900 --> 18:59.400
It's just that everyone thinks that

18:59.400 --> 19:02.400
I'm seeing things
or I'm dreaming things.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.400
I'm telling you, Dad, something
is wrong with this house.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.900
Honey, you said you saw
someone on the first night.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.900
But I checked everywhere,
and there wasn't a soul around.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
It's not just that, though.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
This whole town is weird.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.400
I mean, it's always dark,

19:20.400 --> 19:23.400
there's never anyone
out on the streets,

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
and those kids
we met yesterday--

19:25.400 --> 19:27.400
They didn't seem like normal kids.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
Sit down.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.800
This town's had a tough time.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.067
I didn't realize it at first,

19:35.467 --> 19:39.133
but most of the people
around here are out of work.

19:39.133 --> 19:42.600
We're lucky
we got this house so cheap.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.600
That means we can live for quite
a while on the money

19:44.600 --> 19:47.533
we got from selling the old house.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.633
You know what that means
for me, don't you?

19:49.633 --> 19:52.633
It means you get to work
on the book you're writing.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.633
That's right.

19:54.633 --> 19:57.133
Just...

19:57.133 --> 20:00.400
Try to remember
we're more fortunate than most.

20:01.833 --> 20:05.233
- Will you do that for me, Amanda?
- I'll try.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.667
That-a-girl.

20:15.167 --> 20:17.167
Hmm.

20:17.167 --> 20:20.667
We need to shim it out.
I'll get to it later.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.167
[ Hinges Creaking ]

20:38.800 --> 20:41.233
Dad really needs to do
some tree trimming back here.

20:41.733 --> 20:44.167
It's so dark.

20:44.667 --> 20:47.633
[ Amanda ]
This whole town seems dark.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.133
Hey. Dark Falls.

20:49.633 --> 20:51.133
[ Sighs ]
Yeah, creepy Dark Falls.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.100
Creepy, boring Dark Falls.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.500
Do you remember
that girl I saw last night?

20:58.500 --> 21:01.400
You mean your nightmare?

21:02.900 --> 21:05.300
It wasn't a nightmare, Josh.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.167
- That girl was in our house.
- [ Whimpers ]

21:08.167 --> 21:11.167
First you thought you saw
that Ray kid in our house,

21:11.167 --> 21:13.667
and now it's the dead girl.

21:13.667 --> 21:16.667
Well, don't you think
it's a little weird...

21:16.667 --> 21:18.667
that I imagined Ray,

21:18.667 --> 21:20.667
and then we met him?

21:20.667 --> 21:22.667
You're freaking me out, Amanda.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.667
I wish you'd just quit seeing things.

21:27.133 --> 21:30.033
Hey, money!

21:31.033 --> 21:34.533
I can't help seeing things
that are there.

21:37.467 --> 21:39.900

- Look at this.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.867
- Petey, did you do this?
- [ Whines ]

21:43.367 --> 21:46.367
- Pete couldn't have done that.
- You know what he's like.

Man, that's really in there.

- What is it?
- I didn't look.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.567
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- It's probably an animal.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.900
Are you sure you didn't
have another bad dream?

23:40.900 --> 23:43.400
This wasn't a dream!

23:44.400 --> 23:46.267

23:50.767 --> 23:54.267
Oh, it's just some junk.

It's-- It's a newspaper.

24:33.367 --> 24:35.367
The Dark Falls Daily.

24:35.367 --> 24:38.867
Look at the date.
It's from years ago.

24:38.867 --> 24:40.833
Listen to this headline:

24:41.333 --> 24:44.333
"Accident at chemical factory
kills workers."

24:44.333 --> 24:46.233
Why didn't you tell us about this?

24:46.233 --> 24:48.867
It was three years ago.

24:48.867 --> 24:50.300
What about pollution?

24:50.300 --> 24:52.600
What if dangerous chemicals
are still in the environment?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
No, no, no,
we tested the soil and water.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.567
There is no danger whatsoever.

I still think it's something
you should've told us about.

24:59.533 --> 25:01.400
Perhaps I should have.

- What about it?

- Something tore a hole in the drywall.
- Could be raccoons.

a different house to live in.

I keep seeing things...

26:49.433 --> 26:52.867
And hearing things,

26:52.867 --> 26:55.333
like people are trying
to get into this house.

26:55.333 --> 26:58.267
- Why would they want to do that?
- I don't know.

26:58.767 --> 27:00.767
But it's scaring me.

27:00.767 --> 27:02.667
I don't wanna scare you
even more,

over your fireplace--

- It gives me a creepy feeling.

Sometimes you look at something
and it just gives you a bad feeling.

Yeah?

27:43.300 --> 27:46.300
Well, it's just like
in those scary movies...

When the family brings
something old into the house

27:48.300 --> 27:50.633

just after we hung that thing up.

wait until Mom and Dad can help us.

But we couldn't.
No one expected this.

We're over by that house.
Come on.

- This is not funny, you two.

- I-it's the walking dead.
- The what?

36:07.367 --> 36:09.167
 [ Mr. Thurston ] It was
the accident at the chemical plant.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.133
All those contaminated
became the living dead.

36:12.133 --> 36:14.133
Now they need
the fresh blood of the living.

36:14.133 --> 36:17.633
And then the living become like them!
That's what they said in the cemetery!

We thought they were
gone for good!
