00:06.276 --> 00:07.300
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:07.511 --> 00:09.536
- Well, that must be tough.
- What?

00:09.746 --> 00:12.715
- Competing with your boyfriend.
- Not boyfriend, just competing.

00:12.916 --> 00:15.908
Any indecision you're feeling about
your future, I can help.

00:16.119 --> 00:20.021
Say the word and I will take
the cardiothoracic off the table.

00:20.223 --> 00:22.691
Feel free to apply
for the trauma fellowship.

00:22.893 --> 00:24.918
You're a little closed-off
for my taste.

00:25.128 --> 00:26.186
Emotionally withdrawn.

00:26.596 --> 00:28.928
Roxanne called twice.

00:29.332 --> 00:30.424
- So?
- So?

00:30.600 --> 00:31.430
So what?

00:31.635 --> 00:33.569
You plan on going through
with the pregnancy?

00:33.770 --> 00:35.795
- I was hoping to.
- What does Doug think?

00:42.979 --> 00:46.813
Do we even pretend to be
living in a democracy anymore?

00:47.017 --> 00:50.748
It's just a power play between career
Republicans and Democrats...

00:50.954 --> 00:52.581
...and who hates who more.

00:52.789 --> 00:55.724
If there were still guillotines
and burning at the stake...

00:55.926 --> 00:58.053
...they'd be doing that to each other.

00:59.196 --> 01:02.563
Hey, this is where
I do two reps of 10.

01:02.766 --> 01:04.995
- You want to go first?
- Go ahead.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.802
I didn't know anybody
stopped at these.

01:08.305 --> 01:10.603
End of your first trimester
you get energy.

01:10.807 --> 01:13.002
I have to keep my heart rate
under 140.

01:14.444 --> 01:15.911
So did you read it?

01:19.082 --> 01:20.379
What did you think?

01:21.451 --> 01:22.975
It's a good letter.

01:23.186 --> 01:26.747
You're very clear about what you want
and don't want from him.

01:27.490 --> 01:29.355
I had to write it all out.

01:29.559 --> 01:32.687
- But you're gonna talk to him?
- Oh, sure. Sure.

01:32.896 --> 01:34.193
I just...

01:35.899 --> 01:39.096
After he reads it I know Doug's
gonna go on his gut reaction.

01:39.302 --> 01:41.896
- I don't want him running back here.
- You don't?

01:46.610 --> 01:48.305
When are you gonna send it?

01:49.846 --> 01:52.906
I'm gonna fax it. I got his
fax number a couple days ago.

01:54.584 --> 01:56.142
What do you think he'll do?

01:56.486 --> 01:57.851
Honestly?

01:58.822 --> 02:00.255
He'll be on the first plane.

02:04.261 --> 02:07.424
Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I'm late. I'm sorry.

02:07.631 --> 02:09.360
- That's okay.
- Thanks for meeting me.

02:09.566 --> 02:11.693
I didn't mean to sound so mysterious.

02:11.902 --> 02:13.301
I didn't know what you drink.

02:13.503 --> 02:15.471
I gave up caffeine for Lent.

02:15.672 --> 02:18.800
Let me get right to the point.
We're both busy people.

02:19.009 --> 02:21.477
- It's about John.
- Carter?

02:21.678 --> 02:26.547
I've tried to bring this up with him
and got nowhere fast. Let me try you.

02:26.750 --> 02:31.619
If you two are involved, flirtation
or twice-a-day sex in the lab...

02:31.821 --> 02:33.789
...someone needs to let me know...

02:33.990 --> 02:35.548
...and I'll get out of the way.

02:35.759 --> 02:37.852
There's nothing going on between
me and Carter.

02:39.796 --> 02:43.664
Okay, maybe at one point I thought
there might be. But no.

02:43.867 --> 02:47.030
We haven't really spoken
in the last few months.

02:49.105 --> 02:50.470
So much for that theory.

02:50.674 --> 02:54.474
Honestly, he works so hard I
doubt he has time to cheat on you.

02:54.678 --> 02:57.579
You mean our relationship has
stalled out on its own?

02:57.781 --> 02:59.544
- I don't know about that.
- It has.

02:59.749 --> 03:00.579
I mean, it has.

03:00.784 --> 03:03.446
We have been at the lot-of-laughs
phase for too long.

03:03.653 --> 03:05.245
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:06.289 --> 03:09.383
You were my last resort
for an obstacle I could tackle.

03:09.592 --> 03:11.583
I wish I had better news for you.

03:13.463 --> 03:16.830
You know, I don't envy you.
He's one mixed-up guy.

03:18.468 --> 03:20.663
He is. Sweet, but mixed-up.

03:21.137 --> 03:23.162
A deadly combination.

03:29.612 --> 03:31.239
I think about your breasts all day.

03:32.082 --> 03:33.811
I think about you.

03:34.551 --> 03:36.018
I'll come to work with you.

03:36.219 --> 03:38.312
Do. I want you to.

03:41.658 --> 03:43.523
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:43.727 --> 03:47.094
Here we go again.
I lost power twice last night.

03:47.297 --> 03:48.696
We didn't.

03:49.799 --> 03:51.596
It's the weather. The humidity.

03:51.801 --> 03:54.031
It's arcing at the substation.

03:54.771 --> 03:55.760
I can't be late.

03:56.339 --> 03:58.773
- I love you.
- I love you.

04:05.849 --> 04:07.510
It's spring.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:02.806 --> 05:04.467
No, really. I admire you.

05:04.674 --> 05:07.165
- I like emergency medicine.
- It takes guts.

05:07.377 --> 05:08.344
What takes guts?

05:08.545 --> 05:13.175
To tackle something that got the best
of her the first time around.

05:13.383 --> 05:16.443
Good, because you're gonna get
a second chance to supervise her.

05:16.653 --> 05:18.985
What am I supposed to do with this?

05:19.189 --> 05:22.283
I called UPS. If they're not here
by this afternoon, let me know.

05:22.492 --> 05:23.982
The Oriental?

05:24.194 --> 05:25.752
It's gotta be in Bangkok by Sunday.

05:25.962 --> 05:28.624
Good boy, Carter. Mother's Day.

05:28.832 --> 05:30.060
- Oh, no.
- This week?

05:30.266 --> 05:31.927
You forgot your mothers?

05:32.135 --> 05:35.229
I better call the bowling alley.
That's what she likes.

05:35.438 --> 05:37.372
What are your kids doing?

05:37.574 --> 05:40.771
Every year, runny eggs
and burnt toast in bed...

05:40.977 --> 05:44.811
...two hours before I want to wake up.
I can't wait.

05:45.014 --> 05:47.380
I never let Mother know
what's in store.

05:47.584 --> 05:50.519
Last year it was a helicopter ride
and a concert.

05:50.720 --> 05:55.248
And this year I'm taking her to the
places she liked to take me as a kid.

05:55.458 --> 05:59.053
The zoo, the Adler, a little tearoom
back in our old neighborhood.

05:59.262 --> 06:01.696
Didn't think I had a mother, did you?

06:01.898 --> 06:03.832
Just trying to picture her.

06:04.434 --> 06:06.368
- So, what do we got here today?
- We?

06:06.569 --> 06:09.470
Didn't IKerry tell you?
I'm spending the day down here.

06:09.672 --> 06:11.401
IKerry just asked for the day off.

06:11.608 --> 06:15.738
As Acting Chief, I wanted a better
understanding of what goes on here.

06:15.945 --> 06:18.709
You want oozing pustules
or projectile vomiting?

06:18.915 --> 06:23.181
I don't want to see patients,
I just want to watch and marvel.

06:23.453 --> 06:25.751
So, together again.

06:34.030 --> 06:36.590
Bet you were about to call.
We got a late start.

06:36.799 --> 06:38.289
Hey, Reece.

06:38.501 --> 06:42.528
- Is Carla's van in the shop again?
- No. She just had a big day today.

06:42.739 --> 06:44.832
Next time she gets stuck,
tell her to call.

06:45.041 --> 06:47.874
We weren't stuck.
I love being with Reece.

06:48.077 --> 06:50.545
All right. Let's get him in here.

06:50.747 --> 06:52.612
I'll pick him up at 3, right?

06:52.815 --> 06:55.443
I'll bring him home
after speech therapy.

06:55.652 --> 06:57.643
I thought you were
going the signing route.

06:57.854 --> 07:00.186
I'm just doing what's best for my son.

07:01.424 --> 07:02.356
Be good, son.

07:07.564 --> 07:11.022
76-year-old male, came in
hypotensive, febrile, purulent sputum.

07:11.234 --> 07:13.168
See? The doctors came right in.

07:13.369 --> 07:15.701
- Septic.
- We had to tube him.

07:15.905 --> 07:19.397
Brought his pressure up with dopamine
and gave him some cefotaxime.

07:19.609 --> 07:21.042
Why don't you get him to ICU?

07:21.244 --> 07:24.771
We're waiting for beds upstairs.
Can you tell us what you have?

07:24.981 --> 07:28.473
74-year-old woman took a spill.
Temp's a little elevated at 99.9.

07:28.685 --> 07:32.086
Well, she fell out of her wheelchair
down the back stoop.

07:32.288 --> 07:34.586
I was ringing the doorbell up front.

07:34.791 --> 07:37.817
And I heard the bang
and my heart sank.

07:38.027 --> 07:41.519
I'm the Armstrong's neighbor.
I insisted on driving them in.

07:41.731 --> 07:46.168
BP's 160/90. Mr. Armstrong
reports symptoms of disorientation.

07:46.369 --> 07:49.463
Alzheimer's.
They don't want to call it that.

07:49.672 --> 07:53.164
- He frets about his health plan.
- Gladys doesn't have her hearing aid.

07:53.543 --> 07:56.842
I do the best I can
looking in on them.

07:57.046 --> 07:58.104
She's such a dear.

07:58.348 --> 08:01.977
- Army's not much of a cook.
- Okay, I get the picture!

08:02.185 --> 08:03.777
Have Carter and Lucy take a look.

08:03.987 --> 08:06.285
Are they done? Is she okay?

08:06.489 --> 08:09.356
And that is why I prefer
my patients anesthetized.

08:09.559 --> 08:12.050
Is she putting on weight,
Nurse what's-her-name?

08:12.262 --> 08:14.662
- Carol Hathaway?
- Is she porking out?

08:14.864 --> 08:17.298
I've had some fantasies
about that one.

08:17.500 --> 08:21.436
Okay, in Exam Four we have a
36-year-old with calf pain...

08:23.339 --> 08:25.773
...recurrent DVT on a heparin drip.

08:25.975 --> 08:27.602
You ever dream about Lizzie?

08:27.810 --> 08:29.573
- What?
- It'd be understandable.

08:29.779 --> 08:34.113
It's one motive I could follow
for the ER trying to poach her away.

08:34.317 --> 08:37.081
The trauma fellowship is not
about poaching, Robert.

08:37.287 --> 08:39.255
How long's it been, Mark...

08:39.522 --> 08:41.751
...since you had a trauma come in?

08:41.957 --> 08:42.982
What? Today?

08:43.192 --> 08:44.625
Five, six hours. Usually...

08:44.827 --> 08:48.763
If you actually had a trauma fellow,
for the last five or six hours...

08:48.965 --> 08:51.433
...that highly skilled
Surgical Resident...

08:51.634 --> 08:53.932
...would've been sitting on her hands.

08:54.137 --> 08:57.732
Or maybe babysitting gorks
waiting for ICU beds.

08:57.940 --> 09:02.843
We got a partial scalping on the way.
Fell down an escalator at O'Hare.

09:03.046 --> 09:06.243
- Not a moment too soon.
- Well, timing is everything.

09:06.716 --> 09:09.082
"Pher-Catch." That's what I need.

09:09.285 --> 09:12.083
That one has no perfume enhancement,
just pure...

09:12.288 --> 09:17.248
...synthetic pheromones for those who
want to maximize biologic signals.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.291
I should try this on Al.

09:19.495 --> 09:23.864
If you're in a committed relationship,
"Full-Pher" is for you.

09:24.067 --> 09:27.833
It has a sandalwood fragrance
but with a dopamine-like boost.

09:28.037 --> 09:29.595
And I'm not one for perfumes.

09:29.806 --> 09:34.573
This isn't perfume!
It's biochemical-awareness therapy.

09:34.777 --> 09:39.771
They say pheromones are responsible
for who you're attracted to.

09:39.982 --> 09:44.248
Exactly. Medical professionals
always understand.

09:44.454 --> 09:45.716
Looking for me?

09:46.289 --> 09:48.120
This is Phyllis...

09:48.324 --> 09:52.784
...Farr. And she experienced some
shortness of breath this morning.

09:55.798 --> 10:00.132
She has a history of A-fib and had
an embolic CVA two years ago.

10:00.336 --> 10:02.429
And she is now on Coumadin and Dig.

10:02.638 --> 10:07.439
One teeny, tiny little stroke.
And I was smoking like a chimney then.

10:08.010 --> 10:09.875
Some men are inherently
less receptive.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.512
I think it was just anxiety.

10:15.718 --> 10:18.016
I have a meeting with Marshall Fields.

10:18.221 --> 10:22.351
Miss Farr thinks she doesn't
need to stay. I'd like her admitted.

10:22.558 --> 10:25.288
Her dyspnea was relieved by nitro.
It could be angina.

10:25.495 --> 10:28.191
Darling, I am entirely
too young for that.

10:28.398 --> 10:30.866
I don't think we need
to admit you yet.

10:31.067 --> 10:34.434
But we should get you on an EIKG
and monitor you here in the ER.

10:34.637 --> 10:36.798
Also check a troponin with a CPIK.

10:37.006 --> 10:38.974
You're saying
to cancel Marshall Fields?

10:39.175 --> 10:42.008
They want you more
when they know you're busy.

10:45.214 --> 10:46.306
Did you send it?

10:46.516 --> 10:48.381
I am. Today.

10:48.584 --> 10:50.779
I'm ravenous.
You really do get cravings.

10:50.987 --> 10:52.249
Can you get to the cafeteria?

10:52.455 --> 10:55.515
Do they have a surf 'n turf?
That's what I feel like:

10:55.725 --> 10:57.886
A big, buttery lobster
and a thick, raw steak.

10:58.094 --> 11:01.586
- Morton's after the shift. My treat.
- No, I want it now.

11:01.798 --> 11:03.425
You have a patient for me?

11:03.633 --> 11:05.726
Sweet lady.
Watch out for the husband.

11:05.935 --> 11:08.028
Where's the rule-out
thoracic aneurysm?

11:08.237 --> 11:10.637
- Maggie's patient?
- Peter told me to take it.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.308
I think she died. Check in Sutures.

11:17.413 --> 11:19.074
Thoracic aneurysm?
Is that the patient?

11:19.282 --> 11:22.012
No. She's back from X-ray.
Where do they want her?

11:22.218 --> 11:23.810
Sorry. Check at the desk.

11:24.020 --> 11:27.183
Peter's already been paged on this,
but you'll want to see.

11:27.390 --> 11:31.656
It takes more than a scalp avulsion
to get my heart pumping.

11:31.861 --> 11:34.853
I had stuff in my hands.
Somebody shoved me from behind.

11:35.064 --> 11:37.464
- I hate escalators.
- How about here?

11:37.667 --> 11:38.861
Yeah. That hurts.

11:39.068 --> 11:41.468
- Elizabeth, nice to see you.
- Scalp injury?

11:41.671 --> 11:45.129
Ms. Price tried to get
to baggage claim headfirst.

11:45.341 --> 11:48.504
- Am I bleeding a lot?
- The scalp likes to gush.

11:48.711 --> 11:52.147
- Would you like to help me tie it off?
- Oh, I'd be delighted.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.718
- Curved IKelly, 3-0 Vicryl.
- I need some suction.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.721
They had our plane circling
for two hours because of the wind.

12:00.923 --> 12:03.517
It's about to storm. There it is.

12:03.726 --> 12:05.819
Think you can put a clamp on it?

12:06.028 --> 12:07.359
With your help.

12:08.698 --> 12:10.928
Holding steady...

12:12.034 --> 12:15.003
There you go. That's it.

12:15.671 --> 12:16.603
Got it.

12:16.806 --> 12:19.775
Now, show me your tip.

12:19.976 --> 12:22.171
You two want me to leave?

12:23.379 --> 12:25.244
Actually, it's surgeon talk.

12:25.715 --> 12:29.879
He elevates his clamp so that
I can slide my suture...

12:30.119 --> 12:31.677
That sounds worse, doesn't it?

12:31.888 --> 12:33.651
Well, you know what they say...

12:34.390 --> 12:36.051
Power's out.

12:36.259 --> 12:40.719
Okay, folks. In a few seconds, the
auxiliary generator will switch on.

12:40.930 --> 12:43.797
- Who's charge nurse for internal?
- Power failure.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.026
Make sure all vents are
plugged into the red outlets

12:48.471 --> 12:52.669
Okay, like I said, false alarm.
Power's been restored.

12:52.909 --> 12:54.399
I never heard no generator kick in!

12:54.610 --> 12:58.569
It takes a few seconds. Your family
would've been taken care of.

12:58.781 --> 13:00.681
You hope. My uncle's connected.

13:00.883 --> 13:04.410
- The machines are on a battery backup.
- I wasn't talking about machines!

13:04.620 --> 13:05.814
A little excitement?

13:06.022 --> 13:07.922
Did Roxanne find you?
She wants lunch.

13:08.124 --> 13:10.092
- It's a little busy.
- She was in Chairs.

13:10.293 --> 13:13.262
Can you help me reboot Miss Farr's
EIKG monitor?

13:13.462 --> 13:15.930
I think it shut off
when we lost power.

13:16.132 --> 13:17.292
Yeah, I'll try.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.731
- It's the perfect time.
- But we haven't gone public yet.

13:20.937 --> 13:22.768
All the more reason to act now.

13:22.972 --> 13:25.736
Some companies won't consider
clients with high-risk profiles.

13:25.942 --> 13:28.968
Especially those
with pre-existing conditions.

13:29.445 --> 13:32.846
Oh, Dr. Carter.
I seem to be powerless.

13:33.049 --> 13:36.018
Yes, I know.
I'll take care of that in a minute.

13:39.355 --> 13:41.619
I had a free hour and I thought...

13:41.824 --> 13:44.850
You hawking my patient?
She might have suffered an MI.

13:45.061 --> 13:48.155
- Lydia said her EIKG was good.
- Are you selling her insurance?

13:48.364 --> 13:53.529
It was a countermove. She was
selling me 100 shares of a pheromone...

13:53.736 --> 13:57.103
It is unethical to prey on people
while they're vulnerable.

13:57.306 --> 13:59.001
"Prey" on people?

14:00.443 --> 14:05.142
I sold insurance before I met you.
I sold you some before we went out.

14:05.348 --> 14:07.339
- Why are you picking a fight?
- I'm not.

14:07.550 --> 14:08.847
Why would I want to fight?

14:09.051 --> 14:12.248
I don't know.
But maybe you want to break up.

14:12.455 --> 14:14.753
It'd be easier over
some failure of mine.

14:14.957 --> 14:16.447
Wrong.

14:17.460 --> 14:19.724
If you want to break up, say so.

14:19.929 --> 14:21.658
Okay. I want to break up.

14:21.864 --> 14:25.630
I think it's sleazy to push insurance
on people when they're patients.

14:27.737 --> 14:29.568
Who left this patient in the hall?!

14:29.772 --> 14:32.104
I saw an X-ray tech.
Did he just leave her?

14:32.308 --> 14:33.570
There's no chart.

14:37.613 --> 14:39.171
Oh, God!

14:39.615 --> 14:41.515
What the hell happened?

14:49.025 --> 14:51.255
She's not breathing!
Let's get her to Trauma!

14:51.460 --> 14:53.860
- We need a hand here!
- What's going on?

14:54.063 --> 14:58.193
Female patient, no I.D. Respiratory
arrest. I think she's been beaten.

14:58.401 --> 15:00.301
- Put her on a monitor.
- We need help!

15:00.503 --> 15:04.234
- What is going on?
- A woman found in the hall.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.375
- It looks like she's been beaten.
- And sexually assaulted.

15:07.576 --> 15:09.305
I'm in. Bag her.

15:09.512 --> 15:11.639
I need postintubation film.

15:11.847 --> 15:14.782
- Is Peter still next door?
- He took Price to Radiology.

15:14.984 --> 15:17.578
BP's 110/80. Pulse ox is 97.

15:17.787 --> 15:21.689
- Order a head and belly CT.
- Fractured ribs. Where'd you find her?

15:21.891 --> 15:24.086
She was outside Exam Four on a gurney.

15:24.293 --> 15:26.318
I saw a tech bring her down
from X-ray.

15:26.529 --> 15:28.827
An X-ray tech or someone from Transpo?

15:29.031 --> 15:31.329
I don't know.
I'd never seen him before.

15:37.106 --> 15:38.368
- From Medicine?
- Sulla Andrews.

15:38.574 --> 15:40.439
- When was she found?
- Couple hours ago.

15:40.643 --> 15:41.871
When did you last see her?

15:42.078 --> 15:46.014
10:00 this morning. It didn't
make any sense that she disappeared.

15:46.215 --> 15:47.773
- She was a patient?
- Medical ward.

15:47.983 --> 15:51.578
- No wonder the cops are everywhere.
- I hope Dr. Corday got a good look.

15:51.787 --> 15:54.756
- Pretty scary.
- I'm looking over my shoulder.

15:54.957 --> 15:58.620
Police say we should alert all
staff to the possibility of a tech...

15:58.828 --> 16:02.195
...or someone who looks like one who
may be dangerous. Let's not panic.

16:02.398 --> 16:03.990
You mean not tell the patients?

16:04.200 --> 16:07.328
- It doesn't seem necessary now.
- The guy probably bolted.

16:07.536 --> 16:10.004
Don't leave any patients unattended.

16:10.206 --> 16:15.143
Don't relinquish patients to anyone
who doesn't have proper hospital I.D.

16:15.344 --> 16:16.868
What if you're not sure?

16:17.079 --> 16:20.173
There's a policeman stationed
in every hallway. Call them.

16:20.382 --> 16:21.440
All right?

16:22.618 --> 16:24.051
Oh, that smarts.

16:24.253 --> 16:26.153
We're trying to be gentle.

16:26.355 --> 16:27.822
Did you change these dressings?

16:28.023 --> 16:30.048
I thought you might want to x-ray her.

16:30.259 --> 16:33.422
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I just suddenly got tired.

16:35.798 --> 16:37.789
Oh, great. I need the right hip.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.998
Did she break anything, doctor?

16:40.202 --> 16:41.999
That's what this x-ray will tell us.

16:42.204 --> 16:46.470
I knew as soon as I heard that bang.
I knew she'd fallen.

16:46.675 --> 16:49.371
Oh, this is a waste of time.

16:49.578 --> 16:54.379
I think it would be best if we come
over here away from the x-ray, okay?

16:55.785 --> 16:57.650
It won't matter.

16:57.853 --> 17:00.845
Gladys, get your car.

17:01.056 --> 17:04.787
Have you had anything to eat?
You've been here for hours.

17:04.993 --> 17:07.428
- Shooting.
- I'm not hungry.

17:07.730 --> 17:09.993
Get the car! I'm not hungry.

17:10.199 --> 17:14.795
Army never eats. Look at him.
Like a scarecrow.

17:15.003 --> 17:17.199
I'm taking her home.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.397
- No one can help.
- How's everything going?

17:20.608 --> 17:24.339
Well, there certainly are plenty
of doctors on hand.

17:24.547 --> 17:25.980
I'm Dr. Carter.

17:26.182 --> 17:28.150
No one can help.

17:28.918 --> 17:30.317
You put her on IV antibiotics?

17:30.519 --> 17:34.717
She had a bleeding sacral decubitus
with surrounding cellulitis.

17:34.924 --> 17:36.619
- She has what?
- Bed sores.

17:37.193 --> 17:39.058
And she's in pain after a fall.

17:39.261 --> 17:42.697
I'm guessing it's a fractured hip.
Her leg is internally rotated.

17:42.898 --> 17:46.129
I'm Gladys, their neighbor.
I brought her in.

17:46.335 --> 17:47.859
Good work, Gladys.

17:48.070 --> 17:50.664
Okay, everything looks under control.

17:52.508 --> 17:54.703
You need any help with her husband?

17:54.910 --> 17:57.970
I was thinking about calling Psych.
He seems depressed.

17:58.180 --> 18:00.444
You might want to stay focused.

18:00.649 --> 18:02.412
But he's her primary caregiver.

18:02.618 --> 18:05.246
Her situation won't improve
unless he's able to help.

18:05.454 --> 18:07.979
Do you really think
he's gonna talk to Psych?

18:08.524 --> 18:09.422
Give it a try.

18:09.625 --> 18:10.819
Also...

18:11.093 --> 18:12.651
...Carol needs a break.

18:19.268 --> 18:21.099
Her name is Laurie Heller.

18:21.437 --> 18:24.531
Ward nurse said her bed
was empty after rounds.

18:24.740 --> 18:26.708
She's talking to the detective now.

18:28.010 --> 18:32.811
Unfortunately, no one up in Medicine
saw anyone resembling the man I saw.

18:34.283 --> 18:35.944
She hasn't regained consciousness?

18:36.151 --> 18:37.914
I don't think she will.

18:38.187 --> 18:41.748
She's been admitted since
a traffic accident 10 days ago...

18:42.958 --> 18:44.391
...in a vegetative state.

18:44.593 --> 18:46.254
Oh, God.

18:48.030 --> 18:52.057
Her family has just been persuaded
to extubate her...

18:52.268 --> 18:55.237
...and transfer her
to long-term nursing care.

18:56.338 --> 18:57.669
They've been hoping for a miracle.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.935
It's barbaric.

19:00.509 --> 19:03.410
Here I am, the worst eyewitness
in history.

19:03.612 --> 19:07.275
I could hardly tell them anything.
I didn't pay attention to the guy.

19:07.483 --> 19:09.075
I'm sure you helped.

19:09.418 --> 19:11.079
Average height, I think.

19:12.121 --> 19:16.751
White, but with a dark complexion.
Maybe Latino, maybe Middle Eastern.

19:16.959 --> 19:19.621
But he didn't have an accent,
as far as I remember.

19:19.828 --> 19:23.594
I don't know. I'm afraid that
what I do remember I'm making up...

19:23.799 --> 19:26.324
...because I don't want to be
of no help.

19:26.835 --> 19:29.235
Maybe talking to him scared him off.

19:31.974 --> 19:36.741
CT confirmed a splenic laceration.
Romano wants to do an ex-lap.

19:37.780 --> 19:39.042
He's gonna operate?

19:39.248 --> 19:42.217
Not that an operation's gonna mean
much to Miss Heller.

19:42.418 --> 19:43.885
Robert says she's a liability.

19:44.086 --> 19:45.610
What do you think?

19:45.821 --> 19:48.187
I think it's better than
doing nothing.

19:49.992 --> 19:51.983
She already got pushed down
an escalator.

19:52.194 --> 19:53.161
It wasn't intentional.

19:53.395 --> 19:55.659
You want her to sit here
while I get my badge?

19:55.864 --> 19:57.661
You're supposed to wear your I.D.

19:57.866 --> 20:00.892
- Since when does the P.D. Care?
- I can vouch for him.

20:01.103 --> 20:03.230
You'd think I was a felon!

20:03.439 --> 20:05.066
Is this Mark Greene's scalp lac?

20:05.274 --> 20:07.504
CT gave the green light to stitch.

20:07.710 --> 20:09.610
Put her in Sutures.
Wear your I.D.

20:09.812 --> 20:11.439
- How come?
- Because I said so.

20:13.015 --> 20:15.006
Carter, I heard a terrible rumor.

20:15.217 --> 20:18.550
- Apparently a patient got assaulted.
- That is true.

20:18.754 --> 20:21.279
I was asking about Roxanne.
Did you break up?

20:21.490 --> 20:23.424
- Who told you that?
- She did.

20:23.625 --> 20:27.026
- Yeah, it's true.
- She won't be coming around anymore?

20:27.229 --> 20:29.561
Can't you think of the rest of us?

20:29.765 --> 20:31.892
- You liked her?
- What's not to like?

20:32.101 --> 20:36.128
Miss Farr's a little altered.
Lucy wants to send her for a head CT.

20:36.338 --> 20:38.363
Doesn't Lucy have her own patient?

20:41.143 --> 20:42.474
What's this one called?

20:43.112 --> 20:45.307
Oh, shoot! What is that?

20:45.514 --> 20:48.176
It's right on the tip of my tongue.

20:48.751 --> 20:52.084
Did you get that hip x-ray result
back on Mrs. Armstrong?

20:52.287 --> 20:54.653
It's not done yet.
Psych is on the way down.

20:54.990 --> 20:56.252
I'm a little worried.

20:56.458 --> 20:59.291
- Miss Farr seems a bit confused.
- I'll check it out.

20:59.495 --> 21:01.588
I think she should have a head CT.

21:01.797 --> 21:04.288
- I'll see you later, Miss Farr.
- Sex.

21:06.235 --> 21:07.566
What?

21:08.037 --> 21:10.938
That's the name of the scent.
"Pher-Sex."

21:13.642 --> 21:17.043
- So your head hurts?
- It may be stuffy in here.

21:17.246 --> 21:21.444
We should put your perfumes away.
Some of them are a little strong.

21:21.650 --> 21:24.210
You have a very slender nose.

21:24.420 --> 21:26.718
- Do I?
- Makes common sense.

21:26.922 --> 21:30.790
The size of the VNO would correspond
to the size of the nasal cavity.

21:30.993 --> 21:31.960
VNO?

21:32.161 --> 21:36.222
Vomeronasal organ. Picks up
messages from other people's glands.

21:36.432 --> 21:39.833
Do you find yourself affected
by the opposite sex?

21:40.269 --> 21:43.033
Oh, I'd say I notice them.

21:43.238 --> 21:46.833
- What about your ability to bond?
- Follow my finger.

21:49.778 --> 21:52.338
Are you experiencing weakness
or numbness?

21:52.548 --> 21:57.884
People with deficient VNOs often
have trouble appreciating oxytocin...

21:58.087 --> 22:02.387
...which is the hormone that evokes
deep...

22:02.658 --> 22:03.625
Intimacy.

22:03.826 --> 22:06.624
I think we should set Miss Farr up
with a head CT.

22:06.829 --> 22:09.992
Dr. Carter, were you breast-fed?

22:14.903 --> 22:17.963
- So I missed another trauma.
- A tragic case, actually.

22:18.173 --> 22:22.007
- Is Romano doing the ex-lap?
- You needn't join us if you're busy.

22:22.211 --> 22:23.701
Well, he'll need an assist.

22:23.912 --> 22:26.779
- We both know I can handle that.
- You're an Intern.

22:26.982 --> 22:30.213
Stop seeing every move I make
as a competition, okay?

22:30.419 --> 22:31.386
Right.

22:32.121 --> 22:35.056
It looks as though you're going
for the trauma fellowship.

22:35.257 --> 22:36.884
I haven't made up my mind.

22:37.092 --> 22:41.051
How many surgical heavyweights does
it take to screw in a light bulb?

22:41.263 --> 22:43.891
Depends on what's at stake, I guess.

22:48.937 --> 22:51.201
I heard you were zonked-out
in the lounge.

22:51.406 --> 22:54.204
I closed my eyes for two minutes.
I was on a break.

22:54.409 --> 22:56.707
I'm entitled to 15 minutes
every four hours.

22:56.912 --> 22:59.608
I know. I've just never seen you
take one.

22:59.815 --> 23:02.249
Well, I'm gonna start.
I need to fax this.

23:02.451 --> 23:04.351
Be my guest. Or you want me to...?

23:04.553 --> 23:07.579
It's kind of personal.
I'll do it myself, if that's okay.

23:07.789 --> 23:09.689
Do I look like IKerry Weaver?

23:27.142 --> 23:28.939
Looks like we're out again.

23:33.615 --> 23:37.244
- I wish I hadn't made that incision.
- I can see enough to suction.

23:37.452 --> 23:38.646
I've got nothing.

23:38.854 --> 23:42.017
Everybody, hold on.
The auxiliary power will kick in.

23:43.825 --> 23:47.124
Don't worry, Mrs. Farr.
We keep flashlights by all the...

23:49.731 --> 23:51.221
What did I spill?

23:54.002 --> 23:55.401
Damn it!

23:55.904 --> 23:58.600
Auxiliary power is online.

23:58.807 --> 24:01.298
Come on. Damn it! Damn it!

24:01.510 --> 24:03.410
I need you on task. Hit every room.

24:03.612 --> 24:06.012
Make sure all vents are
in redundant plugs.

24:06.215 --> 24:08.046
- I'm coming.
- What's going on?

24:08.250 --> 24:10.115
Do you have any batteries?

24:10.319 --> 24:12.378
Leave it to the cops to be prepared.

24:12.588 --> 24:16.115
- Is this all the lighting we get?
- Lighting is not priority.

24:16.325 --> 24:19.556
Jerry, could you get my letter
out of that damn thing?

24:19.761 --> 24:21.251
We're gonna follow the plan.

24:21.463 --> 24:24.728
Critical equipment first,
patient concerns second.

24:26.201 --> 24:27.532
I wish it weren't getting dark.

24:27.736 --> 24:30.603
- What about the rapist?
- Still missing.

24:30.806 --> 24:34.572
Everyone, please calm down.
Everything is under control.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.651
Don't worry.
We do have a loss of power.

24:54.863 --> 24:58.822
Our backup generators will supply
power to the ventilator...

24:59.034 --> 25:01.559
...and to the pump
that delivers your meds.

25:03.272 --> 25:05.001
We need some light over here!

25:05.207 --> 25:07.539
I think Lucy's getting a flashlight.

25:07.743 --> 25:09.005
Oh, there we go!

25:09.211 --> 25:12.874
Oh, no, Gladys. The red plugs
are for priority medical use.

25:13.081 --> 25:13.979
Why?

25:14.182 --> 25:17.447
We need to conserve
our auxiliary power.

25:17.753 --> 25:22.053
Dr. Greene's looking for you. The ICU
wants to send down six criticals.

25:22.257 --> 25:25.385
They have this new backup generator
that never came on.

25:25.594 --> 25:26.959
Oh, boy! Here.

25:27.296 --> 25:30.390
Mr. Armstrong?
This is Dr. Myers from Psych.

25:30.832 --> 25:35.360
He just wanted to talk to you
in another room for a few minutes.

25:36.805 --> 25:39.239
Everyone can stay,
but until power's restored...

25:39.441 --> 25:42.239
...we won't be starting
any noncritical cases.

25:42.611 --> 25:45.273
- It's 670, I'm telling you!
- 670 is not transmitting.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.447
Jerry?

25:46.648 --> 25:48.343
Static is all I can hear.

25:48.550 --> 25:51.144
- I'm not getting a line.
- Outside lines don't work.

25:51.353 --> 25:53.753
This is hard-wired to the ICU,
isn't it?

25:53.955 --> 25:55.855
We can't take six more criticals.

25:56.058 --> 25:59.186
I'm trying to offer the ICU
four of our Life-Paks instead.

25:59.394 --> 26:01.692
- That'll only give us two!
- What can I do?

26:01.897 --> 26:04.695
Can you get radio contact
to the ICU?

26:04.900 --> 26:06.162
I can. B3 to 740.

26:06.368 --> 26:07.528
What's that noise?

26:07.736 --> 26:10.261
Sounds like a low battery.
I'll check.

26:11.540 --> 26:13.440
- Oh, sorry.
- Slow down.

26:13.642 --> 26:15.234
What's that smell?

26:16.912 --> 26:18.470
No retroperitoneal bleeding.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.705
The liver, duodenum
and pancreas look okay.

26:20.916 --> 26:23.248
This makes you hopeful about Y2IK.

26:23.452 --> 26:25.352
It's out everywhere in the building.

26:25.554 --> 26:27.647
- Did you call?
- I couldn't get through.

26:27.856 --> 26:29.983
Go check on the little nipper, Peter.

26:30.192 --> 26:32.387
Reece has this thing about the dark.

26:32.594 --> 26:34.118
It is just the spleen.

26:34.329 --> 26:37.662
- Do you have an extra flashlight?
- We'll fix you up.

26:37.866 --> 26:41.734
- I want a smoke!
- We would love to let you out, okay?

26:41.937 --> 26:43.768
I've got the code here.

26:44.639 --> 26:45.901
Is that it?

26:47.442 --> 26:49.103
The key pad's not getting juice.

26:49.311 --> 26:51.176
Fine! I'll smoke in here!

26:51.380 --> 26:56.579
Jerry, walk that guy out the employee
entrance. And call Engineering.

26:56.785 --> 26:59.686
You need an hour to get a ProTime?
I can't wait that long.

26:59.888 --> 27:01.549
Did an animal die around here?

27:01.757 --> 27:04.658
Anyone see where Psych
took Mr. Armstrong?

27:04.860 --> 27:07.658
She has a history of embolic CVAs
and now she's altered.

27:07.863 --> 27:09.353
- Miss Farr's worse?
- Who?

27:09.564 --> 27:11.532
I knew she needed a CT.

27:13.769 --> 27:15.327
Aren't we closed
to internal disaster?

27:15.537 --> 27:18.097
- Maybe they didn't get the news.
- Get it done!

27:20.742 --> 27:24.007
- What's with the doors?
- The generator's on a magnetic lock.

27:24.212 --> 27:27.909
The key pad which releases the door
is on nonessential power.

27:28.116 --> 27:30.243
- What does that mean?
- It means we're screwed.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.354
- Open up!
- Yeah, we're trying to.

27:34.556 --> 27:36.854
You have anything
to pry open the doors?

27:37.058 --> 27:40.824
- I'll check!
- We got a 33-year-old repairman...

27:41.029 --> 27:42.792
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah. Go on!

27:42.998 --> 27:45.728
A possible electrocution
and a 15-foot fall.

27:45.934 --> 27:48.732
He was found unconscious
at the foot of a power pole.

27:49.504 --> 27:52.405
Frequent PVCs in the field.
Normal sinus now.

27:52.607 --> 27:53.539
Let me try.

27:54.075 --> 27:57.636
He may have been struck by lightning.
His coworker said it went close.

27:58.013 --> 28:01.608
Okay, people. We're gonna take
him in through the window.

28:03.552 --> 28:07.648
We need you to get up and move
to the other side of the hall.

28:07.856 --> 28:09.915
Let's get all these chairs
out of here.

28:10.559 --> 28:12.288
Eric, can you give me a hand?

28:12.894 --> 28:14.759
- Can we get this window off?
- Lift.

28:14.963 --> 28:16.191
Why don't we smash it?

28:16.398 --> 28:17.695
No, no, no. We got it.

28:22.571 --> 28:23.868
Just the backboard.

28:24.072 --> 28:26.506
We need a gurney in here. Lengthwise.

28:26.708 --> 28:27.834
Are you ready?

28:30.078 --> 28:33.479
Good. Okay. Everybody grab hold.
Easy, easy.

28:36.785 --> 28:37.843
How're you doing?

28:39.287 --> 28:40.845
Welcome to County General.

28:42.591 --> 28:46.459
Get on the radio to Dispatch
and tell them we are closed to trauma.

28:46.661 --> 28:47.593
Got it.

28:47.796 --> 28:49.787
- She's crashing!
- Miss Farr?

28:49.998 --> 28:52.592
Get on it, both of you.
Jerry, page Benton.

28:55.170 --> 28:56.296
Reece?

28:58.874 --> 28:59.863
Where's her bottle?

29:00.075 --> 29:01.269
Reece, where are you?

29:02.244 --> 29:04.109
- It's Daddy.
- Right over here.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.553
What are you doing?

29:14.890 --> 29:16.289
What are you doing?

29:19.060 --> 29:20.288
What is that?

29:20.495 --> 29:24.124
You're looking at the sky.
Is this fun?

29:31.640 --> 29:34.871
- Penny for your thoughts.
- I hesitate to say.

29:35.777 --> 29:38.245
We're ready to close.
4-0 Vicryl, please.

29:38.613 --> 29:42.242
I was just thinking Miss Heller's
body's been through quite enough.

29:43.518 --> 29:45.611
An accident, a coma...

29:45.820 --> 29:47.412
...a brutal attack.

29:48.056 --> 29:50.650
The kindest thing might be
to let her go in peace.

29:51.426 --> 29:53.326
Of course, we can't.

29:53.528 --> 29:55.655
Careful what you ask for.

29:56.131 --> 29:57.689
She's bradying down.

29:57.899 --> 29:58.957
Don't tell me that.

29:59.167 --> 30:00.964
EIKG looks good.

30:01.169 --> 30:02.727
Looks like a lightning strike.

30:02.938 --> 30:05.099
I was up the pole.
That's all I remember.

30:05.307 --> 30:06.274
A flashover effect.

30:06.474 --> 30:07.941
I want to keep this shirt.

30:08.777 --> 30:11.143
- It's all yours.
- Full-thickness burns.

30:13.315 --> 30:14.577
What have we got?

30:14.783 --> 30:16.876
- What have you got?
- Hi, Reece.

30:17.085 --> 30:19.349
He took a hit of lightning,
fell 15 feet.

30:19.554 --> 30:23.354
No guarding or tenderness.
Let's prep for a lavage. Let's move.

30:23.825 --> 30:25.122
Hang on, man.

30:26.895 --> 30:29.830
- Why are you doing a nasotrach?
- So I won't paralyze her.

30:30.031 --> 30:31.623
All right, I'm in.

30:31.866 --> 30:33.595
Go ahead. Bag her.

30:34.369 --> 30:35.893
- Good job.
- Not really.

30:36.104 --> 30:38.800
Without a CT, I have no
idea what to do next.

30:39.007 --> 30:40.838
Don't you think she threw a clot?

30:41.042 --> 30:42.976
If she's inadequately anticoagulated.

30:43.178 --> 30:46.511
She needs heparin to thin her blood
and prevent further clotting.

30:46.715 --> 30:49.183
What if she's overanticoagulated?

30:49.384 --> 30:51.909
Then she needs IK and FFP.
Heparin would kill her.

30:53.922 --> 30:55.549
Good breath sounds. Hook her up.

30:55.757 --> 30:57.987
- That's why you needed a ProTime.
- Bingo.

31:00.929 --> 31:03.397
Is an AC of 14 okay in the vent?

31:04.299 --> 31:06.164
- We're dead.
- I'll bag her.

31:06.368 --> 31:07.835
What the hell?!

31:08.803 --> 31:10.361
Oh, we just lost backup.

31:10.572 --> 31:12.233
- This is still on.
- It's on battery.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.601
Patients on vents have to be bagged.

31:14.809 --> 31:16.140
Get them started.

31:16.344 --> 31:19.677
I lost my monitors for a 62-year-old.
History of CVA and heart disease.

31:19.881 --> 31:21.371
- Auxiliary power is out.
- Life-Paks?

31:21.583 --> 31:24.711
- We gave the extras to ICU.
- Go. I'll take care of this.

31:24.986 --> 31:25.975
What do you think?

31:26.187 --> 31:27.677
She can take that one.

31:27.889 --> 31:30.119
Thanks. What happened
to the generator?

31:30.325 --> 31:33.123
I thought it was supposed
to be foolproof.

31:33.328 --> 31:34.795
Apparently not.
Can you take Reece?

31:34.996 --> 31:36.759
Jerry can look after him.

31:36.965 --> 31:38.660
Mark, Carter needs you!

31:38.867 --> 31:41.131
Okay. Go, Mark. I got this one.

31:41.336 --> 31:42.200
Okay.

31:42.404 --> 31:44.167
- Another unit in.
- Still no pressure.

31:44.372 --> 31:46.169
Damn it! Damn it!

31:46.374 --> 31:50.538
I can't think without the alarms
blaring. Try phenyl ephedrine.

31:50.745 --> 31:51.905
Wait!

31:52.280 --> 31:55.078
Her neck veins are distended.
No pulse in the aorta.

31:55.283 --> 31:56.477
- Tamponade?
- Exactly.

31:56.685 --> 31:58.744
60-cc syringe, 18-gauge needle.

31:58.953 --> 32:00.443
You're going in blind?

32:01.890 --> 32:04.324
Okay. Retract the left lobe
of the liver.

32:04.793 --> 32:09.492
Pericardiocentesis without monitors.
Careful not to puncture the ventricle.

32:09.698 --> 32:11.063
It's all right. Got it.

32:11.266 --> 32:13.700
Give me a minute to check
the pressure.

32:14.135 --> 32:15.830
I think it's coming up.

32:16.504 --> 32:17.664
All in a day's work.

32:21.609 --> 32:24.271
We're boned. The wrong treatment
could kill her.

32:24.479 --> 32:27.915
- Don't worry. We're here with you.
- We need the CT.

32:28.149 --> 32:29.844
Watch her chest expansions.

32:30.051 --> 32:32.110
Whole-blood clotting time.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.345
- What?
- Something from the Dark Ages.

32:34.556 --> 32:36.615
Do you have an extra red top on you?

32:36.825 --> 32:39.453
Of her blood? Yeah.
I always hold one.

32:39.994 --> 32:43.395
- How long ago did you draw it?
- About 45 minutes ago.

32:45.133 --> 32:48.159
Yeah. No signs of clotting.

32:48.470 --> 32:51.166
- I'll say she's overanticoagulated.
- So we treat her?

32:51.372 --> 32:52.771
We do an LP first.

32:52.974 --> 32:54.498
Do you have a minute?

32:54.709 --> 32:57.269
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'll take over.

32:59.914 --> 33:01.347
Lavage is negative.

33:01.549 --> 33:04.074
- Blood in the urine.
- Could be ruptured bladder or kidneys.

33:04.285 --> 33:06.753
No CT. You want to do an ex-lap?

33:06.955 --> 33:07.944
Let me see this.

33:08.723 --> 33:11.283
Let's get a specimen cup
and set up a microscope.

33:11.493 --> 33:13.017
I've lost his pulse.

33:13.228 --> 33:14.820
- I think he's in V-tach!
- Move!

33:18.800 --> 33:21.030
Let's get the defibrillator back!

33:21.970 --> 33:24.768
- Carol, where's Haleh's patient?
- Exam One.

33:31.646 --> 33:33.705
- You okay in here?
- Fine.

33:36.084 --> 33:37.278
Get away from her.

33:37.485 --> 33:39.976
- What the hell?
- Step back. Security!

33:40.188 --> 33:41.655
- Hey, relax.
- Who are you?

33:41.856 --> 33:44.882
Tom Frawley. I'm an RN at Mercy,
but I live down the block.

33:45.627 --> 33:46.719
Do you have I.D.?

33:46.928 --> 33:49.761
I came in to help.
They said to irrigate her scalp lac.

33:50.465 --> 33:52.524
He's doing a real nice job.

33:55.403 --> 33:57.667
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't know you.

33:57.872 --> 33:59.032
It's okay.

34:01.476 --> 34:03.944
Good pickup. I've got him on Ativan.

34:04.145 --> 34:07.774
- He seemed pretty depressed.
- He's having suicidal ideation.

34:07.982 --> 34:10.416
- Really?
- It happens more than people know.

34:10.618 --> 34:14.018
A lot of thoughts about pulling the
trigger. He's a danger to himself.

34:14.222 --> 34:15.813
What about others?

34:16.324 --> 34:19.418
- I need that!
- I'll bring it back as soon as I can.

34:19.627 --> 34:21.389
- No pulse.
- I'll hook up the lead.

34:21.596 --> 34:23.757
Don't bother. I'll take a quick look.

34:27.869 --> 34:30.429
He's in fib. Let's shock him at 200.

34:30.638 --> 34:32.071
- Set.
- Clear!

34:33.241 --> 34:35.766
Damn! 300. Clear!

34:37.512 --> 34:38.501
375! Clear!

34:38.713 --> 34:40.772
- It's not charged yet.
- Batteries take longer.

34:40.982 --> 34:42.949
We'll be lucky if there's
a charge left.

34:43.150 --> 34:45.210
- Set.
- Clear!

34:46.187 --> 34:47.279
Got it. Thank God!

34:47.487 --> 34:51.891
Push lidocaine to 100 and keep an eye
on him. Where's the microscope?

34:52.994 --> 34:54.484
- How am I doing?
- Great.

34:54.696 --> 34:56.425
Maybe I'll take the MCATs.

34:56.630 --> 34:59.964
- Such a long way down.
- I know, Dottie.

35:00.168 --> 35:03.194
You said you heard a bang
when you walked up to the door?

35:03.404 --> 35:04.632
I did.

35:04.839 --> 35:08.331
You heard Dottie fall down the stoop
even without your hearing aid?

35:08.543 --> 35:12.707
Well, I heard a bang.
Can you see okay?

35:13.314 --> 35:14.576
Yes.

35:15.550 --> 35:18.417
That bedsore's a bad one, isn't it?

35:19.754 --> 35:21.688
That's not a bedsore.

35:27.095 --> 35:28.357
IKerry?

35:28.796 --> 35:31.890
- Anyone want fried chicken?
- You read my mind!

35:32.100 --> 35:33.533
Who fixed the doors?

35:33.735 --> 35:37.933
- They opened as we lost the generator.
- You lost the generator? Scary.

35:38.139 --> 35:42.303
It's been 40 minutes. Our battery
packs are guaranteed for 45.

35:42.510 --> 35:44.034
This chicken smells great.

35:44.245 --> 35:48.045
Everything in my freezer's gone
to mush. It was cook it or lose it.

35:48.249 --> 35:50.217
- You made this?
- Always cook with gas.

35:50.418 --> 35:51.680
So, what can I do?

35:51.886 --> 35:53.717
I've checked all the exam beds.

35:53.922 --> 35:57.585
See if Benton needs help in
Trauma One. Thank you so much.

35:57.792 --> 35:59.282
It's so good.

36:02.096 --> 36:03.961
Prep with the vitamin IK?

36:04.165 --> 36:07.032
And mannitol, in case she herniates.

36:07.235 --> 36:10.432
Don't worry, Carter.
I'm using a 22-gauge needle.

36:11.205 --> 36:14.197
- You holding up, Lydia?
- Oh, yeah. Strong hands.

36:14.409 --> 36:18.106
Don't be afraid to let Carter know
if you need to be spelled.

36:23.017 --> 36:24.951
Let's get the FFP.

36:26.454 --> 36:31.687
Give vitamin IK, 10 milligrams, slow
IV push. How are the pupils, Carter?

36:31.893 --> 36:33.622
Equal and reactive.

36:34.395 --> 36:35.828
Thanks for the backup.

36:36.030 --> 36:37.520
No problem.

36:39.534 --> 36:41.729
He zapped the guy back
with a shock to spare.

36:41.936 --> 36:44.928
- He puts urine under the microscope...
- And it's bright red!

36:45.139 --> 36:47.539
- He says it's not blood.
- Rhabdomyolysis?

36:47.742 --> 36:49.039
And myoglobinuria.

36:49.243 --> 36:53.179
He was breaking down muscle, probably
from the lightning and trauma.

36:53.414 --> 36:54.779
Sounds like you didn't need me.

36:54.983 --> 36:57.918
Didn't you say something
about some chicken?

37:13.935 --> 37:15.766
Well done, Dr. Corday.

37:18.673 --> 37:20.072
Thank you.

37:21.342 --> 37:25.176
I'd be remiss if I didn't say this.
You are an exceptional surgeon.

37:25.713 --> 37:29.979
It would be tragic for you to waste
your talents on a trauma fellowship.

37:37.792 --> 37:40.693
I'm aware that you don't relish
working with me.

37:41.596 --> 37:43.621
I'm in your face. I can't resist.

37:44.966 --> 37:47.457
But know this.

37:49.504 --> 37:53.235
I would do anything in my power
to have you stay in Surgery.

37:54.842 --> 37:57.936
Including making myself
as scarce as possible.

38:01.049 --> 38:03.142
I appreciate that.

38:05.186 --> 38:06.414
Think about it.

38:13.161 --> 38:14.651
I'll take over.

38:16.297 --> 38:17.924
The cops want to see you.

38:33.314 --> 38:36.408
The facility engineers found him
in the switch room.

38:40.655 --> 38:42.247
He hung himself.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.499
Is that the guy?

39:08.816 --> 39:10.249
That's him.

39:17.592 --> 39:20.493
- Get everybody back on vent.
- Reboot all monitors!

39:20.695 --> 39:23.061
- You got it!
- This place is a mess!

39:23.264 --> 39:26.563
- CT's holding a table.
- How are you doing, Mrs. Farr?

39:26.767 --> 39:28.792
We'll take that out when
you come back.

39:29.003 --> 39:31.369
I was very careful with your VNO.

39:31.672 --> 39:35.108
So, Carter, I need to ask you,
what was going on in there?

39:35.443 --> 39:37.536
I was worried that she'd herniate.

39:37.745 --> 39:40.942
I mean between you and me.
I was getting a weird energy.

39:41.149 --> 39:46.451
I mean, I couldn't tell if you were
being territorial or admiring me...

39:46.654 --> 39:50.556
I don't want to say that you
were flirting. Obviously...

39:50.758 --> 39:53.090
You weren't flirting with me,
were you?

39:53.294 --> 39:55.023
Oh, man!

39:55.229 --> 39:58.426
You know, I spilled those pheromones
on me, like a whole bottle.

39:58.633 --> 40:02.330
- Is that what I smelled?
- Maybe you picked up on a chemical.

40:02.537 --> 40:03.834
That's pretty far-fetched.

40:04.038 --> 40:08.498
I mean, I admired you when you
went for the LP. But that was it.

40:09.744 --> 40:11.541
I better get these to the lab.

40:14.549 --> 40:16.449
- Get him?
- Got him.

40:19.187 --> 40:23.385
Ten months after I retire,
they're bought out.

40:24.058 --> 40:26.185
Health plan's kaput.

40:27.728 --> 40:30.094
She can't get out of bed.

40:34.435 --> 40:37.029
I wrote my pension wrong.

40:37.238 --> 40:40.730
If I go first, she gets nothing.

40:41.042 --> 40:44.011
- I had to take care of her.
- I know.

40:44.679 --> 40:48.513
But what I don't know about
is the bullet.

40:49.450 --> 40:52.146
What kind it was...

40:52.353 --> 40:54.651
...and whether you were
firing from above.

40:55.156 --> 40:57.556
In that case,
it might've hit her bladder.

40:57.758 --> 41:01.057
Or if you were aiming
directly at her spine.

41:04.332 --> 41:07.495
It was a Walther automatic.

41:09.203 --> 41:12.172
I took it off a German officer.

41:16.744 --> 41:21.044
The Army gave me papers for it.

41:22.850 --> 41:24.715
At the end of the war...

41:25.019 --> 41:28.921
...pistols were the only thing...

41:29.123 --> 41:33.184
...they let us Gls keep.

41:35.429 --> 41:36.828
I see.

41:39.967 --> 41:41.229
God, what a day!

41:41.435 --> 41:43.903
ComEd says there was arcing
at the substation.

41:44.105 --> 41:46.733
According to Facilities,
our backup generator shut down...

41:46.941 --> 41:49.967
...because of a failed bearing
in the cooling fan.

41:50.177 --> 41:54.341
That makes it all clear.
I'm not 100o/o comfortable in the dark.

41:54.548 --> 41:58.314
I guess a candle-lit dinner
would not be an enticing offer?

41:58.519 --> 42:00.885
I'm afraid not. I'm heading home.

42:01.088 --> 42:03.352
Some advice: I wouldn't do that.

42:03.858 --> 42:06.850
Rule number one of trauma:
After a day like today...

42:07.061 --> 42:09.586
...you should shift gears,
not take it home.

42:09.797 --> 42:11.594
So, what do you suggest?

42:12.733 --> 42:14.064
We're out of here.

42:14.268 --> 42:15.792
Hope you have power at home.

42:16.404 --> 42:17.666
We'll be fine.

42:24.845 --> 42:26.972
- Looking for this?
- You got it out.

42:27.181 --> 42:30.173
It didn't go through
and I didn't have a number.

42:30.384 --> 42:32.477
That's okay. I'll fax it later.

42:32.687 --> 42:35.349
- Did you read it?
- No, you said it was personal.

42:39.193 --> 42:40.956
So it was a suicide pact.

42:41.162 --> 42:44.427
I wouldn't exactly call it that.
The wife wasn't in on it.

42:44.632 --> 42:48.159
Myers said it's not unheard of.
Depression over aging...

42:48.369 --> 42:50.360
...Ioss of control, a downward spiral.

42:50.571 --> 42:52.061
How long were they married?

42:52.540 --> 42:54.701
Fifty-four years.

42:55.042 --> 42:57.533
Makes you wonder if something
was always missing.

42:58.879 --> 43:02.315
I'm not the one to ask
what makes a lasting relationship.

43:04.251 --> 43:06.014
Never had a lasting relationship.

43:07.288 --> 43:10.223
Not that I don't want
to find that someone.

43:10.691 --> 43:11.817
Just haven't.

43:12.793 --> 43:14.021
I know.

43:14.228 --> 43:17.254
Your parents stayed together,
but they shut you out.

43:17.465 --> 43:21.902
They lived like childless jet-setters
and made marriage a mystery to you.

43:22.903 --> 43:25.997
My problem, on the other hand,
is that...

43:26.340 --> 43:29.275
...I was raised by such a capable,
self-sufficient...

43:29.477 --> 43:33.675
...single mom that it's hard for me
to see the need for a partner at all.

43:35.683 --> 43:37.810
How long was that Psych rotation?

43:46.293 --> 43:48.284
Go, go, go!

43:52.600 --> 43:55.000
- Hang in there.
- That's the hard part.

43:56.370 --> 43:58.201
You just gotta watch out.

44:02.042 --> 44:03.100
Here. You have a go.

44:03.310 --> 44:07.076
- No, after a fall like that...
- I'd be in traction for the season.

44:07.281 --> 44:10.341
You've gotta get back up
on your skis, on the slope.

44:10.551 --> 44:11.848
Okay.

44:12.319 --> 44:14.310
- I can do this.
- You can do anything.

44:14.522 --> 44:18.117
<i>Three, two, one! Go!</i>

44:18.325 --> 44:19.314
Go!

44:20.060 --> 44:22.688
Thank God for electricity!

44:28.936 --> 44:30.904
Why did I have to bring that up?

44:31.105 --> 44:32.572
Just give it a minute.
