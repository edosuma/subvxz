00:07.163 --> 00:08.781
<i>Morley: I'm not wrong about Flint.</i>

00:08.832 --> 00:11.483
<i>- To him we're all disposable.
- I don't believe that.</i>

00:11.534 --> 00:14.870
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

00:14.955 --> 00:16.171
You found the schedule.

00:16.256 --> 00:18.507
What if I forgo payment for the schedule

00:18.591 --> 00:20.542
in exchange for my share of the prize?

00:20.627 --> 00:21.961
We'll need some additional items.

00:22.012 --> 00:24.380
<i>- New guns... 12-pounders.
- You'll have it.</i>

00:24.464 --> 00:25.848
Without the Urca we have nothing.

00:25.932 --> 00:28.000
Without Vane we don't have the Urca.

00:28.051 --> 00:30.853
Our friend tried to protect
you. You left anyway.

00:30.937 --> 00:34.506
- Why?
- How did you feel when she threw you aside?

00:34.557 --> 00:36.692
<i>- (Max screaming)
- Eleanor, wait.</i>

00:36.776 --> 00:38.844
(grunting)

00:38.895 --> 00:41.363
<i>Eleanor: Listen to me
carefully. You are finished.</i>

00:41.448 --> 00:44.233
Unless you decide to join
the crew of Captain Flint.

00:44.317 --> 00:45.684
Looks like she just gave us a ship.

00:45.735 --> 00:47.820
Ship with no captain.

00:47.871 --> 00:50.122
- So sorry he did this to you.
- He didn't do this to me.

00:50.189 --> 00:51.657
You did.

00:54.694 --> 00:56.795

<i>(bell rings)</i>

02:44.110 --> 02:46.211
Captain Gates.

02:48.414 --> 02:50.299
(knocks)

02:51.634 --> 02:53.802
It's time.

03:01.794 --> 03:03.595
(crew murmuring)

03:13.606 --> 03:16.825
First item for the council
concerns leadership.

03:16.909 --> 03:19.528
As you know, I've been
asked to serve as captain

03:19.612 --> 03:22.281
of the Ranger when next we sail.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.649
Obviously that means less
time spent with you idiots.

03:24.701 --> 03:26.318
- (crew laughs)
- So...

03:26.369 --> 03:29.988
you will need somebody to act as
your quartermaster in the meantime.

03:30.039 --> 03:33.491
Unless anybody's got any better ideas,

03:33.543 --> 03:35.660
I was thinking Billy Bones.

03:35.712 --> 03:37.629
(cheering)

03:41.801 --> 03:43.018
I thought so.

03:43.102 --> 03:44.803
Billy.

03:47.023 --> 03:48.724
<i>Billy: Ahem.</i>

03:48.808 --> 03:52.177
Next item... careening.

03:52.228 --> 03:54.396
<i>- (grumbling)
- Man: Bad start, Billy.</i>

03:54.480 --> 03:57.115
She's long overdue. If
we're gonna win the Urca,

03:57.183 --> 03:58.984
the Walrus must be shipshape.
That means we tip her.

03:59.035 --> 04:01.153
Plain and simple. The question is,

04:01.204 --> 04:02.871
where do we do the tipping?

04:02.955 --> 04:05.957
- Wherever there's plenty of rum.
- (Laughing)

04:06.025 --> 04:07.826
As always, the ship's account is open.

04:07.877 --> 04:11.213
Rum casks and Mr. Simpson's
buttered oranges are on their way.

04:11.297 --> 04:13.749
And the pigs are being
readied for Mr. Silver's spit.

04:15.868 --> 04:17.369
Now, to return to the issue of location.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.803
What about the fuck tent?

04:18.870 --> 04:21.505
That's probably something we can discuss.

04:21.557 --> 04:24.760
(crew chanting) Fuck tent! Fuck tent!

04:26.212 --> 04:27.429
Mr. De Groot.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.384
You may not like what I have to say,

04:32.435 --> 04:35.354
<i>but if it remains unsaid, I fear the worst.</i>

04:35.405 --> 04:37.555
<i>I've inspected the shoreline
proposed by the captain</i>

04:37.607 --> 04:40.108
for this undertaking and
it is simply unsuitable

04:40.193 --> 04:42.577
to the task at hand. The anchorage is poor.

04:42.662 --> 04:44.562
<i>The incline too steep.</i>

04:44.614 --> 04:47.232
I cannot endorse it. The
risk for calamity is too high.

04:47.283 --> 04:50.252
<i>With the crew's assent,</i>

04:50.336 --> 04:53.905
I ask for time to find
a more suitable beach.

04:53.956 --> 04:55.340
<i>Flint: And delay our efforts by how long?</i>

04:55.408 --> 04:58.460
Two weeks? A month?

05:01.631 --> 05:03.515
A clean hull

05:03.582 --> 05:06.768
means an extra knot or two in speed,

05:06.853 --> 05:09.754
five degrees or more in coming about.

05:09.806 --> 05:12.524
It's essential to the job at hand.

05:13.926 --> 05:17.062
If we had weeks, we'd surely take them.

05:17.113 --> 05:19.597
But we must sail within days

05:19.649 --> 05:21.599
<i>if we are to meet the Urca.</i>

05:21.651 --> 05:24.069
Now, Mr. De Groot's concerns are valid...

05:25.738 --> 05:28.156
<i>but they come at a price.</i>

05:28.241 --> 05:32.627
$5 million in Spanish gold, to be exact.

05:32.712 --> 05:35.914
(crew murmuring)

05:43.339 --> 05:45.290
All those in favor of the captain's plan

05:45.341 --> 05:46.558
to careen here near the bay?

05:46.625 --> 05:49.144
All: Aye!

05:49.228 --> 05:51.146
It would appear the ayes have it.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.764
Nay.

05:57.636 --> 06:00.989
Mr. Morley's dissent is noted
along with Mr. De Groot's.

06:03.693 --> 06:05.527
All right, let's beach this bitch.

06:05.611 --> 06:09.281
Yeah, quick question, then. Where
are we on the issue of the fuck tent?

06:09.332 --> 06:12.584
- Crew: Yeah!
- This job is gonna happen fast.

06:12.651 --> 06:16.087
That means more risk, more danger.

06:16.155 --> 06:17.839
Now you've put a great deal of trust in me

06:17.924 --> 06:20.125
to serve in Mr. Gates' absence,
and I take that seriously.

06:20.176 --> 06:23.712
So given the potential
for distraction and delay

06:23.796 --> 06:25.514
at a time that we need to be at our best,

06:25.598 --> 06:28.300
perhaps we can all agree to forgo,

06:28.351 --> 06:31.887
just this once, a fuck tent.

06:36.976 --> 06:38.977
<i>(thumping)</i>

06:54.860 --> 06:56.962
(flies buzzing)

06:57.029 --> 06:59.080
You shouldn't have.

07:06.172 --> 07:08.173
(men shouting)

07:14.263 --> 07:16.932
Stale winds, still waters.

07:17.016 --> 07:19.651
Don't be such an old lady.

07:19.718 --> 07:21.069
The men will rise to it.

07:21.153 --> 07:23.721
What say you, Mr. Quartermaster?

07:23.773 --> 07:25.890
You think it's a good idea?

07:25.942 --> 07:28.109
Yeah, I think the captain
knows what he's doing.

07:31.664 --> 07:32.914
<i>(bell rings)</i>

07:32.999 --> 07:36.535
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

07:37.837 --> 07:39.955
Who's Mrs. Barlow?

07:43.543 --> 07:45.410
Number of years back,

07:45.461 --> 07:48.380
before you crewed up with us,

07:48.431 --> 07:51.883
Flint had us hunting a merchant ship,

07:51.934 --> 07:54.252
the Maria Aleyne.

07:54.303 --> 07:55.920
Sephardic trade...

07:55.972 --> 07:59.357
gold, pearls, jewels.

07:59.425 --> 08:03.061
"More than we'd ever know
what to do with," he said.

08:03.112 --> 08:05.814
But that's Flint's gift, isn't it?

08:05.898 --> 08:10.151
Always knows just what
to say to push us harder,

08:10.236 --> 08:13.955
further, make us all pull
together for the cause.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.541
We tracked that bitch for months

08:16.609 --> 08:19.077
without refitting or careening,

08:19.128 --> 08:21.830
till finally we spotted her.

08:21.914 --> 08:24.799
We lost good men taking her

08:24.884 --> 08:28.503
for a haul nowhere near
what Flint had promised.

08:28.588 --> 08:31.956
While I was exploring the hold,

08:32.008 --> 08:35.260
I chanced upon a cabin
and that's when I heard it.

08:35.311 --> 08:39.514
'Twas a man and a woman
begging for their lives.

08:40.765 --> 08:44.352
"Spare us, and our fortune's yours."

08:44.437 --> 08:48.490
For a moment, I thought all our shares

08:48.574 --> 08:50.825
were gonna be worth a whole lot more.

08:50.910 --> 08:54.663
But that's when the screams began.

08:57.533 --> 09:01.119
And when I watched the murderer leave,

09:01.170 --> 09:03.755
I saw him plain.

09:07.826 --> 09:09.260
Did you tell anyone?

09:09.328 --> 09:11.296
Gates.

09:12.548 --> 09:16.434
He was unmoved, to say the least.

09:16.502 --> 09:20.805
"Just one rich bastard
less in the world," he said.

09:20.856 --> 09:23.858
At the time, I'll admit, I took his point.

09:25.444 --> 09:28.229
But days later we come ashore.

09:28.314 --> 09:31.733
I see a lady waiting for Flint.

09:31.817 --> 09:35.787
The rest of the crew thought she's
just some fancy bit of Puritan tail.

09:35.854 --> 09:38.206
But when Flint reaches her,

09:38.290 --> 09:41.826
<i>two words escape his lips.</i>

09:41.877 --> 09:43.578
<i>"They're dead."</i>

09:43.663 --> 09:46.214
Hunting the Maria Aleyne

09:46.298 --> 09:48.800
was never about money.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.669
It was an execution.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.254
<i>All those men we lost taking her,</i>

09:53.339 --> 09:56.207
they died so Flint could settle

09:56.258 --> 10:00.044
<i>some personal vendetta for her.</i>

10:00.096 --> 10:02.931
You watch.

10:03.015 --> 10:06.735
Good men will die for some hidden agenda.

10:06.819 --> 10:08.987
The Barlow woman's agenda.

10:09.054 --> 10:10.739
Mark my words, Billy.

10:12.891 --> 10:15.076
It's all happening again.

10:19.632 --> 10:22.100
<i>(thumping)</i>

10:31.260 --> 10:33.261
(moaning)

10:33.345 --> 10:36.181
<i>(thumping, moaning continues)</i>

10:39.885 --> 10:42.053
(gasps)

10:53.199 --> 10:55.450
(sighs)

11:09.465 --> 11:12.000
<i>Miranda: Will you be staying long?</i>

11:13.469 --> 11:15.420
I have to get back.

11:20.309 --> 11:22.927
If you're upset with me,
I'd appreciate you saying so.

11:25.798 --> 11:27.432
You know why I'm upset.

11:28.934 --> 11:30.301
Because I read to him?

11:30.352 --> 11:32.470
There's a whole shelf full of books.

11:32.521 --> 11:34.972
Why'd you have to read him that one?

11:35.024 --> 11:38.109
Perhaps because I am no longer willing

11:38.160 --> 11:41.329
to bury it on a shelf and
pretend it has no meaning for me.

11:46.335 --> 11:50.338
That book is something
I shared with Thomas.

11:54.593 --> 11:56.878
<i>I just missed it.</i>

11:58.497 --> 12:00.832
Our life then

12:00.883 --> 12:03.468
when he was alive.

12:05.938 --> 12:07.639
I can feel myself forgetting it

12:07.690 --> 12:09.057
and I don't want to forget it.

12:10.860 --> 12:15.363
This place, this life that
we've been living here,

12:15.447 --> 12:18.650
it doesn't feel like living anymore.

12:21.821 --> 12:24.489
I can't be alone in feeling this way.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.460
Some part of you must feel it, too.

12:45.427 --> 12:47.729
Things will get better here.

12:49.682 --> 12:51.900
I promise you they will.

13:03.996 --> 13:05.780
Here you go.

13:14.406 --> 13:16.174
Christ.

13:16.241 --> 13:19.460
<i>One week without a ship and
you go completely to hell.</i>

13:19.545 --> 13:21.763
Is it too much to ask
that you not pick a fight

13:21.847 --> 13:24.349
over every insult thrown our way?

13:24.416 --> 13:27.101
<i>Especially when I'm out there
swallowing what little pride I have left</i>

13:27.186 --> 13:28.887
trying to set things right.

13:31.423 --> 13:33.691
I see we've graduated to opium.

13:39.064 --> 13:42.116
Miss Guthrie has dealt us quite a blow.

13:42.201 --> 13:44.652
But we still have assets.

13:44.737 --> 13:47.956
<i>Eight loyal men, my wits,</i>

13:48.040 --> 13:50.441
<i>and an unshakable captain.</i>

13:50.492 --> 13:52.076
(sniffs)

13:52.127 --> 13:54.412
I'm doing what I can to
regain us our livelihood,

13:54.463 --> 13:56.915
but once that's done,
this crew, such as it is,

13:56.966 --> 13:59.584
will need its captain back.

13:59.635 --> 14:01.502
See what you can do about finding him.

14:08.394 --> 14:10.345
Fuck you, Jack.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.593
It was an isolated incident.

14:42.661 --> 14:45.263
No cause for concern.

14:45.330 --> 14:48.499
Your girl humiliated one of
this island's strongest earners,

14:48.550 --> 14:50.301
threatened his crew with embargoes

14:50.352 --> 14:53.021
so they had no choice
but to toss him aside.

14:53.105 --> 14:54.689
I've had three other captains approach me

14:54.773 --> 14:56.441
all asking the same question...

14:56.508 --> 14:58.609
who's next to lose their livelihood

14:58.677 --> 15:00.611
<i>because they crossed her on the wrong day?</i>

15:00.679 --> 15:02.196
No one is next.

15:03.732 --> 15:06.567
Every morning for months now
when I walk the beach into town,

15:06.652 --> 15:09.704
I see Captain Lilywhite
standing on his stoop

15:09.788 --> 15:11.689
and jabbering away to
anyone who will listen

15:11.740 --> 15:14.409
<i>about the evils of a centralized fence.</i>

15:14.493 --> 15:16.828
Arguing that this island will never be free

15:16.879 --> 15:20.331
until we all come together to
cast off the tyrannical yoke

15:20.382 --> 15:23.084
of Queen Eleanor.

15:23.168 --> 15:25.253
I see him out there, too.

15:26.588 --> 15:28.539
And I have never seen
any more than three men

15:28.590 --> 15:30.207
paying him any attention.

15:30.259 --> 15:31.426
Half-wits, all of them.

15:31.510 --> 15:33.428
There were 12 of them this morning.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.815
This business with Vane has changed things.

15:38.934 --> 15:41.519
Get control of her, Mr. Scott,

15:41.570 --> 15:43.154
before it's too late.

15:46.191 --> 15:49.410
Sail spotted. The Andromache.

15:53.398 --> 15:55.500
<i>(door closes)</i>

15:57.336 --> 15:59.287
Captain Bryson is
arriving on the Andromache.

15:59.371 --> 16:00.738
<i>You'd best get down to the beach.</i>

16:00.789 --> 16:02.256
What did Captain Hornigold want?

16:05.377 --> 16:08.212
Let me guess.

16:08.263 --> 16:09.797
The captains grousing about last week

16:09.882 --> 16:11.132
think I've lost my grip on reason.

16:11.216 --> 16:13.518
<i>Fuck Hornigold.</i>

16:13.585 --> 16:15.269
Fuck the captains and fuck anyone else

16:15.354 --> 16:17.355
who doesn't like the
way I manage this place.

16:23.929 --> 16:26.814
What we're about to
attempt with Captain Bryson,

16:26.899 --> 16:29.117
it is very risky.

16:29.201 --> 16:30.985
If he will not cooperate,

16:31.070 --> 16:33.071
we cannot, under any circumstances,

16:33.122 --> 16:35.123
attempt to detain him.

16:35.207 --> 16:36.824
- What makes you think I'd try?
- 'Cause I know you.

16:36.909 --> 16:38.709
I know what you think is at stake.

16:38.777 --> 16:41.329
And I know you think you
cannot take no for an answer.

16:41.413 --> 16:43.164
Why should I?

16:45.717 --> 16:48.252
Eleanor, if you make a move

16:48.303 --> 16:50.088
against Captain Bryson or his ship,

16:50.139 --> 16:52.723
you'll be making a move against
the Guthrie Trading Company.

16:52.791 --> 16:54.675
A direct affront to your grandfather

16:54.760 --> 16:56.477
<i>and his interests in Boston.</i>

16:56.562 --> 16:58.629
That ship belongs to him.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.231
When he finds out what you've done,

17:00.298 --> 17:03.684
no one... not I nor your father...

17:03.769 --> 17:07.271
will able to protect you
from the consequences.

17:07.321 --> 17:11.075
If Bryson balks, we must let him go.

17:11.143 --> 17:15.029
And the guns Flint needs? What about them?

17:15.114 --> 17:16.781
We'll find them some other way.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.317
I never ask anything of you.

17:20.368 --> 17:22.086
This I must insist on.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.339
Tell me you understand.

17:29.294 --> 17:31.129
I understand.

17:45.978 --> 17:47.612
(playing)

17:47.679 --> 17:49.730
(laughing)

17:59.408 --> 18:01.075
- How we doing?
- Ahead of schedule.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.195
Ready to raise the keel. I think
we might actually pull it off.

18:04.246 --> 18:06.581
We'll have Billy to thank for that.

18:06.665 --> 18:08.049
<i>I have no idea how he's done it,</i>

18:08.133 --> 18:09.800
<i>but he's kept them to a schedule.</i>

18:09.868 --> 18:11.335
<i>I don't think I've ever seen a crew</i>

18:11.386 --> 18:12.720
<i>work this fast and this hard.</i>

18:14.506 --> 18:16.390
<i>A few more days, we'll
have the keel cleared</i>

18:16.475 --> 18:19.427
<i>and tarred and she'll be ready
to go back into the water.</i>

18:19.511 --> 18:21.429
Excuse me, Captain.

18:23.148 --> 18:25.266
That's it. Secure these ropes.

18:25.350 --> 18:27.602
<i>Man: Listen here, you smart-mouthed fuck.</i>

18:27.686 --> 18:29.604
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

18:29.688 --> 18:32.940
I said I've got the shits. What
part of that don't you understand?

18:33.025 --> 18:34.442
What's going on?

18:34.526 --> 18:36.894
His rotten pig gave the lot
of us the bloody squirts.

18:36.945 --> 18:38.529
It's possible it wasn't the pig, you know.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.114
Some people have weak constitutions.

18:40.199 --> 18:42.500
Hey! Settle down.

18:43.902 --> 18:45.536
(flies buzzing)

18:49.458 --> 18:51.909
Mmm. It's delicious.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.761
It's likely as not it wasn't the pig.

18:53.845 --> 18:56.380
It's just something that's
going around. Get back to work.

18:59.468 --> 19:01.936
Thank you. I'm glad someone here likes...

19:02.020 --> 19:05.389
(spitting) What the
fuck did you do to that?

19:05.440 --> 19:07.191
I cooked it... ?

19:07.259 --> 19:08.776
You absolutely did not.

19:08.860 --> 19:10.478
The men seemed to think it looked done.

19:10.562 --> 19:12.730
Yes, well, they'd eat it raw
if left to their own devices.

19:12.781 --> 19:15.233
(chuckles) That's awfully cynical.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.235
<i>(laughs)</i>

19:23.242 --> 19:24.492
Go get another pig.

19:27.379 --> 19:28.829
Do exactly as I say.

19:39.791 --> 19:42.093
<i>(man moaning)</i>

19:43.395 --> 19:45.763
(panting)

19:52.571 --> 19:54.855
Now you see how it can be?

19:54.940 --> 19:57.692
When I'm made to feel comfortable,

19:57.776 --> 20:02.330
<i>you are made to feel le toucher de dieu.</i>

20:05.417 --> 20:07.952
<i>It's like our bodies
are all made up of these</i>

20:08.003 --> 20:10.321
secret little compartments, she says,

20:10.372 --> 20:13.007
what's got pleasures hidden inside 'em.

20:13.091 --> 20:15.760
And it just takes someone

20:15.827 --> 20:19.297
who knows how to unlock 'em. That's it.

20:45.791 --> 20:49.460
Your friends, they have seen the reward

20:49.527 --> 20:51.545
<i>for gentle obedience.</i>

20:51.630 --> 20:54.198
If pleasure is what you want,

20:54.249 --> 20:57.885
I assure you I can give
it to you if you let me.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.760
(grunts)

21:07.729 --> 21:08.846
Indeed.

21:08.897 --> 21:11.816
<i>(Max sobbing)</i>

21:18.357 --> 21:20.524
<i>(Max sobbing)</i>

21:47.853 --> 21:49.353
- Captain Bryson.
- Mistress Guthrie.

21:52.190 --> 21:54.225
I trust your passage was comfortable.

21:54.276 --> 21:56.777
My cargo will be inventoried
and off-loaded in the morning.

21:56.862 --> 21:58.446
You'll find the books in good order.

21:58.530 --> 22:00.731
That's good to hear, but I was
hoping we could have a word.

22:02.284 --> 22:05.769
Seeing as our every word only
prolongs my stay in this cesspool,

22:05.821 --> 22:07.771
I trust you'll make it quick.

22:07.823 --> 22:10.374
I thought it best you heard from me first.

22:10.442 --> 22:13.461
One of our crews intends
to hunt the Urca de Lima.

22:15.664 --> 22:17.581
A move against a state asset?

22:17.632 --> 22:19.250
And your father hasn't quashed it?

22:19.301 --> 22:21.952
- No, he hasn't.
- Why on earth not?

22:22.003 --> 22:23.804
Why don't you ask him yourself?

22:23.889 --> 22:26.090
He'll be in my tavern shortly.

22:31.430 --> 22:34.482
I understood you meant
to hide his presence here.

22:34.566 --> 22:36.767
We did until this morning.

22:38.970 --> 22:40.187
Stand up, please, sir.

22:45.143 --> 22:48.245
Once upon a time Mr. Scott
was my personal houseboy.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.532
Until he proved himself worthy

22:51.616 --> 22:53.484
of greater responsibility.

22:53.535 --> 22:55.536
That earned him an education

22:55.620 --> 22:57.838
which he then passed on to my daughter.

22:57.923 --> 23:00.174
And look where that's gotten me.

23:01.826 --> 23:03.711
I'm afraid I still don't follow.

23:05.514 --> 23:08.933
Captain Bryson commands the
largest of my supply ships.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.602
My daughter needs the guns from that ship

23:11.669 --> 23:13.337
to arm Captain Flint

23:13.388 --> 23:16.273
for his move against the
Spanish treasure galleon.

23:16.341 --> 23:19.026
Parting Bryson from his guns, however,

23:19.110 --> 23:21.312
will require some convincing.

23:21.363 --> 23:24.949
Evidently, Eleanor knows better
than to try to do it herself.

23:25.016 --> 23:27.868
And how can she be sure
you won't betray her

23:27.953 --> 23:31.822
and alert Captain Bryson
to the fact of your arrest?

23:31.873 --> 23:35.159
Because Bryson would have no choice
but to liquidate our holdings here

23:35.210 --> 23:37.495
and return me to Boston a failure.

23:37.546 --> 23:41.582
Therefore, whatever resentments
I might feel towards my daughter

23:41.666 --> 23:44.969
and your friend the
captain, I must put aside.

23:45.036 --> 23:48.389
Absorb the blow, as it were.

23:48.473 --> 23:50.224
Like a rocky promontory.

23:52.377 --> 23:55.563
At any rate, I have a meeting to attend.

24:01.236 --> 24:02.937
Shall we?

24:06.525 --> 24:08.859
<i>(door opens)</i>

24:08.910 --> 24:10.561
<i>(door closes)</i>

24:10.612 --> 24:12.029
(men shouting)

24:20.589 --> 24:22.590
When I get my share of that Spanish gold,

24:22.674 --> 24:25.576
I'm going to fuck my
way through high society.

24:25.627 --> 24:28.212
Nary a duchess's snatch be uncharted.

24:28.263 --> 24:30.347
<i>(men laugh)</i>

24:32.968 --> 24:34.969
What the fuck is this?

24:35.053 --> 24:36.604
You said tie it to the palm.

24:36.688 --> 24:38.772
That palm. That one.

24:38.857 --> 24:41.525
<i>You tied it to the wrong fucking tree.</i>

24:44.312 --> 24:46.230
Yes, it matters.

24:46.281 --> 24:48.232
Jesus, fix it, will you, please?

24:52.404 --> 24:53.770
Christ.

24:53.822 --> 24:56.490
Give a man a little bit of power.

24:56.575 --> 24:58.325
What the fuck difference does it make?

24:58.410 --> 25:00.110
They're both trees, ain't they?

25:00.161 --> 25:02.296
Agreed.

25:04.082 --> 25:06.050
Quick fuck?

25:11.222 --> 25:13.591
(creaking)

25:19.514 --> 25:21.932
<i>(wind rustling)</i>

25:27.739 --> 25:29.990
(exhales)

25:30.075 --> 25:32.026
(purring)

25:32.110 --> 25:34.778
<i>Morley: Shove over, Randall.</i>

25:36.281 --> 25:38.949
The shade's mine for the next hour.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.651
Don't want no arguments.

25:40.702 --> 25:42.703
Did you bring me barnacle?

25:42.787 --> 25:44.788
Oh, fuck.

25:44.839 --> 25:47.007
Sorry, mate.

25:47.092 --> 25:49.009
I forgot.

25:49.094 --> 25:52.012
You promised. For Betsy.

25:52.097 --> 25:54.798
You're right.

25:54.849 --> 25:57.217
Hold my spot.

26:01.806 --> 26:03.057
What the... ?

26:05.677 --> 26:07.945
Hey, what the fuck is your problem?

26:08.012 --> 26:09.613
Morley: No problem at all, sir.

26:09.681 --> 26:11.848
Just doing my share for a worthy cause.

26:11.900 --> 26:14.234
Oh, so what is it? You tell me a story

26:14.319 --> 26:16.370
and I'm supposed to fall
in lockstep behind you?

26:16.454 --> 26:19.022
You wouldn't even raise your voice

26:19.074 --> 26:21.992
to question the captain's
plan. Didn't even consider it.

26:22.043 --> 26:24.962
Maybe I considered it and
decided it was making sense.

26:25.029 --> 26:26.580
Maybe.

26:26.665 --> 26:30.167
Or maybe there's something
you'd rather not say out loud.

26:32.370 --> 26:34.471
Thought when that lackey
Gates stepped aside,

26:34.539 --> 26:36.340
we might have finally
gotten a quartermaster

26:36.391 --> 26:38.425
who wasn't fully in the captain's pocket.

26:40.562 --> 26:42.262
Guess I was mistaken.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.583
How exactly does the most
feared captain of the high seas

27:02.667 --> 27:04.585
learn how to spice and glaze a pig?

27:04.669 --> 27:06.620
What do you care?

27:06.705 --> 27:10.290
Well, I don't, really.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.459
It's just that there's
something we need to talk about

27:12.544 --> 27:15.045
and I thought a little
small talk beforehand

27:15.096 --> 27:16.513
might be better than diving right in.

27:16.581 --> 27:18.882
What the hell are you talking about?

27:21.603 --> 27:23.303
What are we going to do about Billy?

27:25.056 --> 27:26.440
Beg your pardon?

27:26.524 --> 27:28.942
As much as it pains me to say this,

27:29.027 --> 27:31.729
as he has been nothing but
warm and welcoming to me,

27:31.780 --> 27:35.282
he appears to be straining at the seams.

27:35.366 --> 27:37.785
<i>I thought maybe we ought to have...
- Stop.</i>

27:37.869 --> 27:41.772
There is no we. Billy
Bones is a dutiful boatswain

27:41.823 --> 27:45.375
who commands enormous respect from
his crew as well as from myself.

27:45.443 --> 27:48.078
I trust him a thousand times more

27:48.129 --> 27:50.447
than I would a rodent like yourself.

27:50.498 --> 27:52.583
Understood.

27:54.052 --> 27:56.253
- All that being said...
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

27:56.304 --> 27:58.338
I saw Billy speaking with Mr. Morley

27:58.423 --> 27:59.973
late last week.

28:00.058 --> 28:01.925
At night.

28:01.976 --> 28:03.393
In secret.

28:03.461 --> 28:05.596
That supposed to mean something to me?

28:05.647 --> 28:08.816
Well, he lied about the page being blank.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.901
I believe it's wearing on him.

28:10.968 --> 28:13.237
I told you once,

28:13.304 --> 28:15.072
I won't tell you again.

28:15.139 --> 28:17.024
I trust Billy.

28:17.108 --> 28:18.492
<i>Trust me.</i>

28:18.576 --> 28:21.195
I'm purely in this for
myself and you know this.

28:21.279 --> 28:24.081
I've no reason to tell you
anything other than the truth.

28:24.148 --> 28:26.617
Both our futures depend on this.

28:26.668 --> 28:29.152
I haven't decided yet whether
you even have a future.

28:29.204 --> 28:31.004
But I can tell you this,

28:31.089 --> 28:33.340
trying to play me against my own crew

28:33.424 --> 28:35.793
will not help your cause.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.098
Turn your pig. It's almost done.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.644
<i>- (wind blowing)
- (Lantern squeaking)</i>

28:57.348 --> 28:59.867
(creaking)

29:24.475 --> 29:27.227
- I can't do it, Jack.
- Of course you can.

29:27.312 --> 29:30.213
You simply present my crew's haul to
Miss Guthrie as if it were your own.

29:30.265 --> 29:32.099
You get a percentage. Everybody wins.

29:32.183 --> 29:34.017
I get caught selling a
grain of salt for you,

29:34.068 --> 29:36.570
the girl puts my crew
on the outs same as you.

29:36.654 --> 29:39.740
<i>I just can't risk it.</i>

29:39.824 --> 29:42.075
It ain't you she has a problem with, Jack.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.027
Why stick with him?

29:45.246 --> 29:47.114
<i>Anne: It's a good question.</i>

29:47.198 --> 29:48.949
No, it's not.

29:49.033 --> 29:50.567
There are other ships.

29:50.618 --> 29:52.569
Had a few offers, have you?

29:52.620 --> 29:55.122
Makes sense. You'd be an asset to any crew.

29:55.206 --> 29:57.958
Now ask how many offers
good old Jack has received

29:58.042 --> 30:00.294
since our run-in with the lady Guthrie.

30:00.378 --> 30:02.379
(blows)

30:02.430 --> 30:04.581
My only assets are my wits,
and as the man who just lost

30:04.632 --> 30:06.917
5,000 pesos of his ship's own money,

30:06.968 --> 30:08.585
they are ill-valued at the moment.

30:08.636 --> 30:11.471
Join another crew right now, the only task

30:11.556 --> 30:15.275
I will be trusted with is
swabbing out the piss buckets.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.594
And that, my darling, I feel
compelled to state out loud,

30:17.645 --> 30:20.814
life is simply too fucking short!

30:22.901 --> 30:25.152
What, you're angry with me, too?

30:25.236 --> 30:27.204
Hey! Jack Rackham!

30:27.271 --> 30:30.123
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- A word.

30:30.208 --> 30:32.542
I'm sorry, I'd prefer you made an
appointment. Quite a full day ahead.

30:32.610 --> 30:35.462
You took one of my best
whores for your private use.

30:35.546 --> 30:39.633
Every day she's not under my
roof fucking costs me money.

30:39.717 --> 30:41.952
Ah, yes, but my crew
sees her as responsible

30:42.003 --> 30:43.720
for the loss of a great
deal of their money.

30:43.788 --> 30:45.722
They see this as a debt
being repaid, nothing more.

30:45.790 --> 30:47.724
Well, I see it as thieving bullshit.

30:47.792 --> 30:49.476
Then I believe we're at an impasse.

30:52.463 --> 30:55.232
Disagreement without
prospect of resolution.

30:55.299 --> 30:56.800
Fuck you, Jack. Give me back the whore.

30:56.851 --> 30:59.653
You'd take her back yourself
if you had the balls.

31:04.492 --> 31:07.194
A few less men outside
that tent than yesterday,

31:07.278 --> 31:09.997
which had fewer than the day before.

31:11.666 --> 31:13.483
Maybe I'll take you up on that offer

31:13.534 --> 31:15.619
sooner than later.

31:21.158 --> 31:23.176
What the hell was that?

31:23.261 --> 31:25.762
Do you have some problem with
us holding onto that whore?

31:27.932 --> 31:31.351
You do realize she's the only thing
keeping what's left of our crew at our side.

31:33.438 --> 31:34.972
Fuck you.

31:41.529 --> 31:42.980
(sighs)

31:43.031 --> 31:45.032
You want the guns from my ship...

31:47.035 --> 31:48.785
to hand over to a pirate?

31:48.853 --> 31:50.353
That is correct.

31:50.405 --> 31:52.322
Have you lost your mind?

31:52.373 --> 31:55.492
You know as well as I do your
family would never approve of this.

31:55.543 --> 31:58.128
What my family approves or does not approve

31:58.195 --> 32:01.298
rests solely on one thing... Eleanor... ?

32:01.365 --> 32:03.216
Profit.

32:03.301 --> 32:05.869
Eleanor's arranged a plan to deliver them

32:05.920 --> 32:08.839
<i>quite a bit of it upon the
success of this operation.</i>

32:08.890 --> 32:11.925
Enough to assuage any fears they
may have about repercussions.

32:12.010 --> 32:13.927
I find that hard to believe.

32:15.346 --> 32:17.380
You're a brilliant seaman, Dyfed.

32:17.432 --> 32:20.183
But in this instance,
you're out of your depth.

32:21.602 --> 32:24.988
Commerce in this place requires bold moves.

32:25.056 --> 32:28.692
I'm fortunate enough to have a
daughter who has found one for us.

32:34.732 --> 32:36.616
Perhaps you're right.

32:39.670 --> 32:41.254
<i>Maybe I am out of my depth.</i>

32:43.424 --> 32:45.959
And yet this feeling persists.

32:46.044 --> 32:47.594
And what feeling is that?

32:47.678 --> 32:50.597
I wonder, Mr. Guthrie, if
this might have something to do

32:50.681 --> 32:53.717
with His Majesty's Ship the Scarborough
currently docked at Harbour Island.

32:53.768 --> 32:55.852
Docked outside your home.

32:55.920 --> 33:00.107
<i>My intent was to stop there first
and unload the slaves in my hold,</i>

33:00.191 --> 33:01.758
<i>but when I saw her, I thought better of it.</i>

33:01.809 --> 33:05.946
His Majesty's ships often
use my port for resupply.

33:06.030 --> 33:09.066
What are you implying?

33:12.937 --> 33:14.871
I'd like to speak with your father alone.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.409
Whatever you can say to
him, you can say to me.

33:19.460 --> 33:22.079
Eleanor, it's all right.

33:33.341 --> 33:35.642
<i>(door opens)</i>

33:37.962 --> 33:39.679
<i>(door closes)</i>

33:43.267 --> 33:45.152
Your father can handle this.

33:45.236 --> 33:46.937
He'll get you those guns.

33:46.988 --> 33:48.939
Perhaps.

34:01.586 --> 34:03.170
I couldn't leave it to chance.

34:05.423 --> 34:08.458
Let us be frank.

34:08.509 --> 34:10.260
You and I both know the low regard

34:10.327 --> 34:12.045
in which your family in Boston holds you.

34:12.130 --> 34:15.181
Quite frank, it seems.

34:15.266 --> 34:17.684
If I returned unarmed and they find

34:17.768 --> 34:19.603
that I did so under these circumstances

34:19.670 --> 34:22.556
with only your orders as justification,

34:22.639 --> 34:26.193
I'll be buried in a shallow
grave somewhere out in Cambridge.

34:26.277 --> 34:29.512
And what exactly do you believe
"these circumstances" to be?

34:29.563 --> 34:32.114
The Navy on your doorstep.

34:32.183 --> 34:34.034
You and your daughter

34:34.118 --> 34:37.070
supporting a plan as reckless as this.

34:37.155 --> 34:40.407
It would seem, sir, that something's gone
terribly wrong with the operation here

34:40.491 --> 34:43.659
and you two are scrambling
to save yourselves.

34:45.496 --> 34:47.797
Tell me I'm wrong.

34:49.867 --> 34:53.386
Let me tell you how wrong you are.

34:53.471 --> 34:55.589
I knew you wouldn't approve.

34:55.672 --> 34:58.341
But I couldn't let him leave
here without giving up those guns.

34:58.392 --> 35:00.010
I'm sorry.

35:00.061 --> 35:01.811
With everything we've been through,

35:01.879 --> 35:03.880
with everything I've done for you...

35:03.931 --> 35:06.183
- I'm doing this for us both.
- You lied.

35:10.354 --> 35:11.738
Shame on you.

35:34.795 --> 35:36.429
The guns are yours.

35:37.765 --> 35:39.099
Mr. Hayes.

35:50.761 --> 35:53.146
Richard: Truly something
to behold, this place.

35:53.231 --> 35:54.898
You should be proud.

35:56.901 --> 35:59.069
Come now, Mr. Scott.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.122
It's as much your work as Eleanor's.

36:02.206 --> 36:05.742
What is this if not the
moment of your vindication?

36:07.411 --> 36:08.795
It's time we got you back.

36:08.879 --> 36:10.914
She'll get herself killed.

36:15.386 --> 36:18.638
If she proceeds with this
Spanish galleon business,

36:18.723 --> 36:20.640
attempting to steal
treasure from one empire

36:20.725 --> 36:22.292
to finance a war against another,

36:22.343 --> 36:24.177
she will get herself killed.

36:24.262 --> 36:27.130
Whether by English noose or Spanish sword,

36:27.181 --> 36:29.432
it's inevitable and you know it.

36:30.935 --> 36:32.936
If she proceeds...

36:34.655 --> 36:36.573
what did you say to Bryson in that room?

36:37.775 --> 36:39.993
Rest assured I had a plan.

36:40.077 --> 36:42.195
Not just to end this insanity,

36:42.280 --> 36:44.981
but to contend with what comes next.

36:45.032 --> 36:47.534
To keep her safe.

36:47.618 --> 36:49.502
I don't envy you.

36:49.587 --> 36:53.673
You know that she'll stop at
nothing to save this place.

36:53.758 --> 36:55.458
A place where she matters.

36:55.509 --> 36:57.994
<i>A place where you matter.</i>

36:58.045 --> 37:01.047
Except that in your
heart you know the truth.

37:03.267 --> 37:06.553
Places like this aren't meant to last.

37:08.172 --> 37:10.390
Help me, Mr. Scott.

37:11.976 --> 37:13.443
Please.

37:13.510 --> 37:16.313
Help me save her from herself.

37:30.578 --> 37:32.495
<i>(branch snaps)</i>

37:37.218 --> 37:39.336
Well, hello.

37:42.089 --> 37:44.057
There's no need to be afraid.

37:46.761 --> 37:49.179
You could help me if you like.

37:52.767 --> 37:54.351
Aren't you the Gladwin boy?

37:57.321 --> 37:59.939
Does your father know
you're out here all alone?

38:00.024 --> 38:01.691
I can take you to him.

38:04.061 --> 38:05.662
Oh!

38:05.729 --> 38:07.997
Witch!

38:27.017 --> 38:28.885
(grunting)

38:31.889 --> 38:33.056
(meows)

38:33.107 --> 38:36.142
Captain. Visitor.

38:42.783 --> 38:45.601
The guns are yours.

38:45.653 --> 38:47.821
Captain Bryson's preparing
to off-load them as we speak.

38:47.905 --> 38:51.107
Mr. O'Malley is on the
lookout to ensure he complies.

38:51.158 --> 38:53.209
Take a seat.

39:01.719 --> 39:03.503
To our endeavor

39:03.587 --> 39:06.589
and success close at hand.

39:10.428 --> 39:11.728
What's wrong?

39:11.795 --> 39:13.847
Your father step out of line?

39:13.931 --> 39:15.982
It's Mr. Scott.

39:16.066 --> 39:19.185
In order to guarantee
Captain Bryson's acquiescence,

39:19.270 --> 39:21.771
I put a plan into place
without Mr. Scott's knowledge.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.658
I lied to him.

39:25.743 --> 39:27.527
<i>Betrayed his trust.</i>

39:27.611 --> 39:30.029
I didn't want to, but I just
didn't think he would understand.

39:30.114 --> 39:32.031
Well, you can't expect him to.

39:32.116 --> 39:34.834
Nobody will believe it's
possible until we show them.

39:34.919 --> 39:36.986
But when that day comes,

39:37.037 --> 39:40.006
you know what they'll say?

39:40.090 --> 39:42.959
They'll say that it was inevitable.

39:46.347 --> 39:49.132
<i>(wind rustling)</i>

39:55.222 --> 39:57.807
(creaking)

39:57.858 --> 39:59.859

40:02.396 --> 40:04.147

40:05.649 --> 40:08.201
<i>Man: Get back!</i>

40:08.285 --> 40:09.702
<i>(men shouting)</i>

40:09.787 --> 40:11.621
Back off! Back off!

40:17.127 --> 40:20.029
Get away! Get away!

40:20.080 --> 40:22.632
Everyone, get up to the beach now! Come on!

40:24.218 --> 40:26.469
<i>(ship groaning)</i>

40:31.208 --> 40:33.009
<i>Billy: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

40:33.060 --> 40:35.345
<i>(cat meows)</i>

40:40.050 --> 40:41.734
<i>She's going!</i>

40:44.221 --> 40:45.488
Get out!

41:00.571 --> 41:02.922
<i>(Randall screams)</i>

41:03.007 --> 41:05.124
Oh, shit.

41:05.209 --> 41:06.793
Randall!

41:08.762 --> 41:11.214
- I'll go.
- Captain, there's no time.

41:11.265 --> 41:13.049
The mainmast is holding too much weight.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.467
We have to cut her loose!

41:14.552 --> 41:16.352
Save the mast. Don't wait for me.

41:18.922 --> 41:21.107
<i>(Randall screaming)</i>

41:23.310 --> 41:26.429
He's dug in. Help me.

41:26.480 --> 41:29.949
- (meows)
- Me leg! Me leg!

41:34.371 --> 41:37.073
Pull! Pull! One, two, three, pull!

41:37.124 --> 41:39.275
(screaming)

41:39.326 --> 41:41.544
It's taking too long.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.585
How much time do we have?

41:48.636 --> 41:49.752
We don't.

41:51.755 --> 41:53.556
Billy, the time is now!

41:53.624 --> 41:57.260
(wood cracking)

41:57.311 --> 41:59.095
(screaming)

42:00.598 --> 42:02.432
It's no bloody use.

42:10.474 --> 42:13.643
Your belt. Give me your belt.

42:13.694 --> 42:15.111
<i>(ship groaning)</i>

42:17.164 --> 42:18.648
<i>- Billy.
- Man: Cut the ropes!</i>

42:18.699 --> 42:20.833
- Billy!
- All right!

42:20.918 --> 42:23.119
Right.

42:24.538 --> 42:25.622
Do it!

42:25.673 --> 42:27.674
(muffled screaming)

42:31.595 --> 42:34.597
Bite. Bite down on it.

42:37.351 --> 42:39.185
Hold on, Randall.

42:39.269 --> 42:40.353
Hold on.

42:42.356 --> 42:44.774
All right, pull!

42:49.179 --> 42:50.897
(screaming)

42:55.402 --> 42:57.620
<i>(creaking stops)</i>

43:24.932 --> 43:26.933
(sighs)

43:48.005 --> 43:49.872
Shit.

44:06.273 --> 44:08.775
I talked to De Groot. You
did everything you could.

44:10.561 --> 44:13.730
Not everything.

44:13.781 --> 44:15.148
<i>I should have stopped Flint.</i>

44:15.232 --> 44:17.600
Honestly, son,

44:17.651 --> 44:19.569
how could you have done that?

44:22.456 --> 44:24.407
Careful, Billy.

44:28.829 --> 44:31.881
Flint pushed it through and I
went along when I knew better.

44:31.948 --> 44:34.000
Because you know what's at stake here.

44:34.084 --> 44:35.918
You know he's right.

44:35.969 --> 44:37.837
That's not why I...

44:44.428 --> 44:46.596
It's because I'm afraid of him.

45:15.325 --> 45:17.960
Billy and Morley.

45:18.011 --> 45:20.096
That night on the ship,

45:20.163 --> 45:22.048
what were they talking about?

45:24.000 --> 45:25.334
Well, I didn't hear much,

45:25.385 --> 45:28.271
but it sounded like they
were talking about a woman.

45:28.338 --> 45:30.606
Somebody Barlow.

45:46.790 --> 45:48.825
<i>(harpsichord music playing)</i>

46:04.341 --> 46:06.642
<i>(door opens)</i>

46:21.942 --> 46:23.359
Success?

46:25.362 --> 46:27.163
Would you mind?

46:34.955 --> 46:37.540
The music you were playing,

46:37.591 --> 46:41.010
<i>that's Purcell's Chaconne
if I'm not mistaken.</i>

46:44.882 --> 46:46.215
You have an educated ear.

46:47.584 --> 46:50.386
My father employed a
tutor for all his children

46:50.437 --> 46:52.688
so that they might learn
to appreciate music.

46:52.756 --> 46:55.942
I took to it the least of my siblings.

46:56.026 --> 46:59.395
But for reasons beyond
me, some of it stuck.

47:03.934 --> 47:06.736
<i>There's a pronounced sense of sadness</i>

47:06.787 --> 47:08.938
<i>in Purcell's pieces.</i>

47:08.989 --> 47:11.607
Considering your circumstances,

47:11.658 --> 47:13.242
I can understand their appeal.

47:15.045 --> 47:18.297
And what is it you think you
understand of my circumstances?

47:18.382 --> 47:20.216
Truthfully,

47:20.283 --> 47:23.085
I might know everything, Mrs. Hamilton.

47:25.389 --> 47:27.223
<i>Don't be alarmed.</i>

47:27.290 --> 47:30.643
<i>I have no intention of disclosing
your identity to anyone.</i>

47:30.727 --> 47:34.563
I'm sorry, sir. I think you have
me mistaken for someone else.

47:34.631 --> 47:37.350
The portrait in your room depicts you

47:37.434 --> 47:39.468
alongside Lord Thomas Hamilton,

47:39.519 --> 47:41.971
son of Alfred Hamilton,

47:42.022 --> 47:44.991
the lord proprietor of
these Bahama Islands.

47:46.476 --> 47:48.194
Forgive me.

47:48.278 --> 47:51.280
I must have gotten
disoriented and wandered.

47:53.917 --> 47:56.919
You see, I've had extensive dealings
with the earl over the years,

47:56.987 --> 48:00.623
and so I'd long heard of the tragedy

48:00.674 --> 48:03.426
that befell his eldest son.

48:03.493 --> 48:05.661
<i>But Thomas's wife,</i>

48:05.712 --> 48:08.848
long rumored to be the cheating sort,

48:08.932 --> 48:10.883
had begun a torrid affair

48:10.968 --> 48:13.386
with her husband's closest friend,

48:13.470 --> 48:17.390
a promising young officer
in His Majesty's Navy.

48:20.110 --> 48:22.979
And upon discovering the affair,

48:23.030 --> 48:25.698
Thomas went mad with grief.

48:27.517 --> 48:29.568
<i>His despair so great,</i>

48:29.653 --> 48:32.705
<i>even the asylum couldn't
protect him from himself.</i>

48:36.827 --> 48:38.995
As for Thomas's wife,

48:39.046 --> 48:42.498
she's said to have fled
London along with her lover.

48:42.549 --> 48:45.551
Partly out of shame,

48:45.635 --> 48:48.838
<i>partly to escape retribution.</i>

48:48.889 --> 48:51.474
Given the facts at hand,
I am forced to assume

48:51.541 --> 48:53.759
that the lover is none other

48:53.844 --> 48:56.479
than our friend Captain Flint.

48:57.781 --> 49:00.716
<i>Please understand, I raise this issue</i>

49:00.767 --> 49:03.402
<i>not to disturb or harass you.</i>

49:03.487 --> 49:07.273
In fact, I wish to help you.

49:09.443 --> 49:10.993
Help me?

49:11.061 --> 49:14.663
I can only assume that
your exile in this place

49:14.731 --> 49:17.616
has been less than ideal.

49:19.402 --> 49:22.004
I understand how desperation

49:22.072 --> 49:23.923
may have driven you here,

49:24.007 --> 49:28.044
but perhaps it's time
you were offered a hand

49:28.095 --> 49:30.262
and a return to civilization.

49:34.351 --> 49:36.769
And you could offer me that?

49:38.855 --> 49:43.275
Boston is quite a different
animal from London.

49:46.613 --> 49:48.781
More forgiving of one's past

49:48.865 --> 49:50.733
in a general sense.

49:50.784 --> 49:52.768
And in this specific sense,

49:52.819 --> 49:55.538
with my family's assistance,

49:55.605 --> 49:59.492
one might find total absolution there.

49:59.576 --> 50:01.994
<i>New identities.</i>

50:02.079 --> 50:04.964
<i>A clean start. A new life.</i>

50:05.048 --> 50:07.083
I could do that for you.

50:07.134 --> 50:09.585
Why on earth would you?

50:09.636 --> 50:12.638
<i>Because I know what it
is to be judged unfairly.</i>

50:12.722 --> 50:14.673
And because it's just possible that,

50:14.758 --> 50:17.560
while I am uniquely situated

50:17.627 --> 50:20.062
to offer you your freedom,

50:20.130 --> 50:22.932
you may be able to do the same for me.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.418
<i>Eleanor: Hello, Charles.</i>

50:51.094 --> 50:52.995
You've looked better.

50:53.046 --> 50:54.830
Fuck you.

50:54.881 --> 50:57.216
<i>We're alone.</i>

50:59.169 --> 51:02.104
You don't have to pretend with me.

51:04.441 --> 51:07.143
The fuck did I ever do to you?

51:08.728 --> 51:10.813
You made me look weak.

51:12.065 --> 51:15.284
Standing beside you, I was your lesser.

51:19.206 --> 51:20.539
I was a girl.

51:23.026 --> 51:24.410
<i>From the moment you met me,</i>

51:24.494 --> 51:26.662
<i>you must have known I'd
never settle for that.</i>

51:28.698 --> 51:31.033
For being less than.

51:31.084 --> 51:33.052
That's why I loved you.

51:36.139 --> 51:37.840
And you destroyed me.

51:39.759 --> 51:42.044
<i>I exposed you.</i>

51:42.095 --> 51:44.680
The weakness behind the mask.

51:49.069 --> 51:50.986
The fear.

51:53.723 --> 51:57.359
So much I have taken from you.

51:59.529 --> 52:01.197
And yet still...

52:03.750 --> 52:06.368
you know you could take it all back.

52:08.872 --> 52:11.540
You could be strong again.

52:11.591 --> 52:14.210
<i>You could resist me.</i>

52:16.046 --> 52:19.014
You could take this whole
fucking island from me.

52:22.686 --> 52:25.888
You know exactly what it is you need to do.

52:25.939 --> 52:29.608
Where it is you need to go to do it.

52:31.645 --> 52:33.562
(man's voice) If only you
weren't so goddamn afraid.

52:33.613 --> 52:35.764
(gasps)

52:35.815 --> 52:38.284
<i>(dogs barking)</i>

53:44.100 --> 53:45.467
(grunts)

53:45.518 --> 53:48.270
(groaning)

53:52.275 --> 53:54.810
Ain't this a sad sight?

53:59.899 --> 54:03.352
Miss Guthrie should
have just had you killed.

54:03.403 --> 54:05.854
It would have been more merciful.

54:05.905 --> 54:08.824
Now, are you going to
give me back me whore?

54:12.412 --> 54:15.030
Jesus! On my shoe!

54:15.081 --> 54:17.383
<i>Oh, fuck it. Put him out of his misery.</i>

54:25.258 --> 54:26.541
(sizzles)

54:26.593 --> 54:28.227
Oh, for Christ...

54:34.601 --> 54:36.568
(screams)

54:36.653 --> 54:39.355
(screaming)

54:44.411 --> 54:46.829
Wait!

54:46.896 --> 54:48.113
Listen to me!

54:54.204 --> 54:55.704
The whorehouse,

54:55.755 --> 54:58.424
<i>I'll cut you in for half.</i>

54:58.508 --> 55:01.043
We'll be partners.

55:01.094 --> 55:02.577
Please.

55:02.629 --> 55:05.631
(growls)

55:05.715 --> 55:07.099
<i>(gagging)</i>

55:07.183 --> 55:09.601
<i>(cracks)</i>

55:25.151 --> 55:27.403
<i>(door closes)</i>

55:29.956 --> 55:33.125
Do you know who I am, Pastor?

55:33.209 --> 55:35.210
I do.

55:35.278 --> 55:38.747
You're the reason this island
is infested with criminals.

55:40.133 --> 55:43.285
God teaches us not to
cheer when others stumble.

55:43.336 --> 55:46.638
In your case, I may ask His forgiveness.

55:46.723 --> 55:50.125
And what does God say about redemption?

55:50.176 --> 55:53.178
Accept His love and you'll find it.

55:53.263 --> 55:54.680
What if I was prepared to go further?

55:54.764 --> 55:56.348
Further?

55:56.433 --> 55:59.801
Penance for my past sins.

55:59.853 --> 56:03.071
<i>Good works.</i>

56:03.139 --> 56:05.023
<i>And they begin tonight.</i>

56:05.108 --> 56:07.109
Who's there?

56:07.160 --> 56:09.328
Mr. Scott.

56:09.412 --> 56:11.497
What are you doing here?

56:11.581 --> 56:13.532
I thought you might use a hand.

56:16.002 --> 56:18.454
Bastard's finally bringing
in the first of the guns.

56:20.323 --> 56:21.457
Took him long enough.

56:23.543 --> 56:25.627
He takes his cargo seriously.

56:28.214 --> 56:31.550
You look tired. Why don't I take over?

56:31.634 --> 56:34.470
Miss Guthrie told me I was to see
those guns off with my own eyes.

56:36.523 --> 56:38.807
I understand.

56:38.858 --> 56:40.642
(grunts)

56:48.201 --> 56:51.203
<i>Richard: I brought the
fiends to this place.</i>

56:52.705 --> 56:54.656
Encouraged them.

56:54.707 --> 56:56.708
Enriched them.

56:56.793 --> 56:59.161
Empowered them.

57:00.964 --> 57:03.832
It seems as though my penance
ought to be a simple one.

57:06.469 --> 57:08.170
I will see to it

57:08.221 --> 57:10.255
that they are cast out of this place.

57:11.558 --> 57:13.725
Soon.

57:13.810 --> 57:15.811
And for good.

57:19.849 --> 57:21.733
The Andromache. It can't be.

57:21.818 --> 57:23.318
Captain Bryson hasn't had time to unload.

57:23.386 --> 57:25.320
He didn't. She's riding low.

57:25.388 --> 57:27.689
<i>Those guns are still on board.</i>

57:27.740 --> 57:29.107
<i>Eleanor: What are we going to do?</i>

57:32.362 --> 57:34.363
Get them back.

57:39.402 --> 57:41.770
