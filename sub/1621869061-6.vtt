14:34.665 --> 14:36.458
-[both chuckle]
-Man!

14:36.542 --> 14:39.086
Great. Now there are two of you.

14:39.169 --> 14:43.382
[chuckles] Bear, it's okay. I want to
introduce you to Jimmy "Fat Man" Jacobs.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.717
[Jimmy] Fat Man.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.344
-I forgot about that.
-Jimmy and I played ball together.

14:47.428 --> 14:52.182
You're looking at the greatest defensive
end in the history of the Guardians!

14:52.266 --> 14:54.143
[both] Ah-ooh!

14:54.226 --> 14:55.227
[Jepperd laughs]

14:55.311 --> 14:58.314
Only 'cause you took those hits for me.
Made me look good.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.608
My head was harder,
but you took your fair share.

15:00.691 --> 15:05.529
Ain't that the truth. I got this funny
sorta static in my head these days too.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.698
Hard to focus sometimes.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.242
I think those are called concussions.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.038
Wait, so you must have
run across those other guys too, huh?

15:14.121 --> 15:16.248
Troy? Rocco?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.542
What about D-Train?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.295
Oh, they're not around anymore, man.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.254
[chuckles]

15:22.338 --> 15:24.381
I wonder how those guys are doing.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.967
We had some good times, didn't we?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.219
[Jepperd exhales]

15:31.764 --> 15:33.182
Yeah, well.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.225
You're working on the train now, huh?

15:35.309 --> 15:39.939
Oh, yeah. Been running charters and
hauling supplies to whoever hires us.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.650
Company's got me on maintenance
and crap like that.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.111
Ain't so bad,
but I sure do miss being on the field.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.613
Don't you?

15:48.238 --> 15:50.908
[inhales, exhales]

15:50.991 --> 15:52.326
Where's Gus?

15:54.662 --> 15:55.496
Hey, Gus.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.750
-It's all right. You can come out.
-The one with the antlers?

15:59.833 --> 16:00.668
Sweet Tooth.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.627
Jepp.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.630
-Hey, Gus. I'm not playing.
-Jepperd.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.257
[ominous music playing]

16:08.258 --> 16:09.134
Where is he?

16:10.094 --> 16:12.012
I think he went looking for Dog.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.182
[music builds to a climax]

16:17.059 --> 16:19.603
[sinister music playing]

16:22.690 --> 16:23.691
[Bobby warbles]

16:23.774 --> 16:24.858
What is it?

16:25.526 --> 16:26.610
What does it mean?

16:27.194 --> 16:28.862
This area's been marked.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.781
By the Last Men?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.118
We need to go.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.162
Right now.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.384
Bobby, go check the tunnels.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.803
But whatever you do, stay out of sight.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.138
-Check.
-Okay?

16:55.889 --> 16:59.643
Shouldn't we take the ribbons down?
That would keep the bad men away, right?

17:00.310 --> 17:01.228
[bolt clicks]

17:01.311 --> 17:03.230
They'd know we're here for sure if we did.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.649
Maybe we should hide, then.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.944
I can get the others and I can play
hide-and-seek, like you showed me.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.822
If they already know we're here,
hiding won't do any good.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.074
We wouldn't have time to run.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.161
-[chains rattling]
-[lock clicks]

17:18.579 --> 17:19.747
[Pigtail] Then what do we do?

17:24.001 --> 17:24.877
Mom!

17:26.336 --> 17:29.590
Hey. Everything's gonna be all right,
I promise.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.216
But I wanna help.

17:33.969 --> 17:37.097
Wendy, I promise.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.308
Do you trust me?

17:45.439 --> 17:47.900
-[sniffs]
-[ominous music playing]

17:50.903 --> 17:52.154
Someone's outside.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.453
[metal rattling]

17:59.536 --> 18:00.662
The outer fence.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.885
Who is he?

18:15.511 --> 18:16.553
A Last Man.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.099
[Pigtail] Why is he just standing there?

18:20.849 --> 18:23.352
-He knows we're here, doesn't he?
-[shushing]

18:25.312 --> 18:26.188
Let me think.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.069
Move on, please, move on.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.617
I thought we would have more time.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.703
Are we safe?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.458
[somber music playing]

18:50.587 --> 18:54.842
[indistinct radio chatter]

18:56.385 --> 18:57.719
[glass clinking]

18:58.428 --> 19:01.223
[Johnny] Oh, I can't remember
the last time I saw these.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.641
Mind if I have one?

19:04.685 --> 19:07.062
Rani, you shouldn't be exerting yourself.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.480
Oh, hush, I'm all right.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.649
[exhales]

19:11.608 --> 19:14.736
It'd be easier to pack
if we knew where we were going.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.946
Sorry.

19:16.029 --> 19:20.200
Are we going east? That's where
your little Last Men clubhouse is, right?

19:20.284 --> 19:21.243
Rani.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.412
General Abbot says it's classified.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.875
[distant chatter]

19:27.958 --> 19:29.334
So that's Abbot, then.

19:29.918 --> 19:30.919
[Dr. Singh] Rani.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.881
I thought he'd be less beardy.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.216
Rani, can you just stop, please?!

19:40.929 --> 19:41.763
[exhales]

19:42.723 --> 19:44.766
-Hey. What is it? What's going on?
-Hey.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.311
-I can't find all the letters.
-Take a breath and relax.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.770
[Dr. Singh] Don't tell me to relax!

19:48.854 --> 19:52.107
We almost just burnt to death,
then Abbot showed up, then you…

19:52.191 --> 19:53.233
[whispers] Okay.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.903
[stammering] And now I can't…
I can't find the tiles,

19:55.986 --> 19:58.071
and that means we can't play anymore.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.741
-I know.
-And w-what we gonna do about Trixie?

20:01.575 --> 20:03.452
They're never gonna let us bring her.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.369
Who's Trixie?

20:06.747 --> 20:07.956
That your kid?

20:08.999 --> 20:13.795
Our horse.
She really helped us out a few times.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.714
Hey.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.258
Can you, uh…

20:19.218 --> 20:21.178
Can you please just wait outside?

20:22.429 --> 20:23.597
Hmm.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.556
I can't.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.353
Where exactly do you think we're gonna go?

20:43.825 --> 20:44.743
Wait. Wait!

20:47.287 --> 20:50.916
I know you're freaking out,
but just try to breathe. It'll be okay.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.335
No, Rani, it's not going to be okay.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.588
How on earth am I supposed
to find a cure for the Sick?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.882
Everyone's been looking for one
for the last ten years.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.425
I don't know, but what I do know is

21:00.509 --> 21:03.262
we have more time together
than we did this morning.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.224
[exhales]

21:07.307 --> 21:11.561
[whispers] What do you think he's gonna do
when he finds out that we were bluffing?

21:12.521 --> 21:15.440
[stammering]

21:15.524 --> 21:17.526
If I didn't know the truth,
I would've believed you.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.529
Your explanation was very convincing.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.080
I'm gonna go pack my things.

21:30.163 --> 21:30.998
Adi.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.501
Adi, come on.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.586
[ominous music playing]

21:42.718 --> 21:44.720
[inhales sharply]

21:51.101 --> 21:53.687
[melancholic music playing]

22:10.996 --> 22:12.998
-[Dr. Singh exhales]
-[Rani sniffs]

22:18.003 --> 22:20.505
I remember when the first patient came in.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.430
Her name was Freya.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.308
Oh, Adi.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.019
It didn't seem like
anything to worry about at first,

22:34.102 --> 22:38.565
just a strange case of the flu,
something that would pass, and then…

22:40.317 --> 22:42.819
a week later she came back, and this time…

22:44.446 --> 22:45.989
she was worse, much worse.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.366
No matter what I did…

22:48.992 --> 22:51.328
no matter how hard I tried to help her…

22:53.538 --> 22:54.539
it didn't matter.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.250
[scoffs]

22:58.835 --> 22:59.795
Then she died.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.465
[Rani sighs]

23:03.548 --> 23:05.384
[Dr. Singh] I know.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.890
I still see them, you know.
All of them. Their faces.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.768
[ominous music playing]

23:14.851 --> 23:18.897
We said we were gonna take care of them,

23:18.980 --> 23:21.191
so they wouldn't be afraid, you know?

23:21.274 --> 23:22.442
[sniffs]

23:25.320 --> 23:27.823
[Dr. Singh]
But all the while, we knew they would die.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.327
And that more would come
and take their place.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.372
After a while, I stopped caring.

23:36.498 --> 23:40.001
Well, I had to,
just to keep going with it.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.089
It made me feel numb.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.429
Hmm.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.683
That's why I stopped being a doctor.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.060
[inhales, exhales]

23:57.561 --> 24:00.856
And after taking over
the clinic from Bell…

24:02.983 --> 24:05.068
and what we did to Doug and Nancie…

24:08.572 --> 24:10.866
that feeling's back, and for what?

24:14.494 --> 24:15.745
To find a cure.

24:16.913 --> 24:17.831
[chuckles]

24:17.914 --> 24:19.416
You don't honestly believe--

24:19.499 --> 24:20.709
I believe

24:21.418 --> 24:23.628
in you, Adi.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.380
[sniffs]

24:25.464 --> 24:27.007
And so did Dr. Bell.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.344
That's why she gave her journal to you.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.974
You can finish what she started.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.104
You're not alone in this.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.360
We've made it this far together,
haven't we?

24:47.444 --> 24:48.487
[chuckles]

24:50.030 --> 24:51.031
Together.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.533
Hmm?

24:57.579 --> 24:59.581
[indistinct radio chatter]

25:02.626 --> 25:05.170
[train whistle blowing]

25:06.671 --> 25:08.131
Gus, you in here?

25:08.882 --> 25:09.716
[Bear] Gus?

25:10.967 --> 25:13.678
I used to sneak off
and I'd get my ass whooped.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.472
He's a kid. He misses his toy.

25:15.555 --> 25:20.018
[Jimmy] Don't worry, T. I know every nook
and cranny of this train. We'll find him.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.521
You guys are hauling a lot of candy bars.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.731
Yeah, part of the same transpo job.

25:24.814 --> 25:27.150
Thought about snaggin'
a couple for myself.

25:28.026 --> 25:31.238
Well, if he isn't in here,
I can't imagine where he is.

25:35.659 --> 25:36.576
Gus?

25:37.577 --> 25:39.412
Sweet Tooth, come on.

25:39.496 --> 25:40.956
Stop playing games.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.208
You'll never guess what they have on here.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.043
A car full of Choc-O-Rockets!

25:46.211 --> 25:48.296
Your boy's quite the troublemaker, huh?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.756
Chip off the old block?

25:50.465 --> 25:52.842
I think Louisa was still pregnant
the last time I saw you.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.806
-Crazy you had one of them animal kids--
-Gus is not my kid.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.853
We should spread out.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.314
I'll check the next car.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.152
-[door closes]
-Dumbass.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.154
What happened, bubba?

26:13.863 --> 26:15.824
To Louisa and the baby?

26:15.907 --> 26:17.367
[somber music playing]

26:17.450 --> 26:18.827
They're gone, Jimmy.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.080
Just like D-Train and the others.

26:25.333 --> 26:26.626
I'm sorry, T.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.753
The Sick get 'em?

26:31.631 --> 26:33.508
What's with the deer kid, then?

26:35.135 --> 26:36.261
He's just a kid, um…

26:41.558 --> 26:44.060
He's just a kid I'm trying to help.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.357
Doesn't sound like the Jepp I remember.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.985
It used to be all about you.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.240
-Mm-hmm.
-[door opens]

26:58.908 --> 27:01.786
Gus! Christ, kid.
Where the hell have you been?

27:02.370 --> 27:04.122
Almost gave me a heart attack.

27:04.205 --> 27:07.250
I can't find him, Jepp.
I… I still can't find Dog.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.337
Hey. Buck up, kid.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.006
There's no crying in the apocalypse.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.634
I'll get you another Dog, I promise.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.968
[Gus] You don't understand.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.679
Pubba made Dog out of his own socks.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.682
It even still smells like him.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.313
[hopeful music playing]

27:28.396 --> 27:29.648
Hey.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.484
Hey. Remember I told you
about reaching Colorado?

27:33.735 --> 27:36.488
When we cross the big river,
we'll be in Colorado.

27:38.782 --> 27:39.658
Well…

27:41.201 --> 27:42.577
Tell me what you see.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.336
Does… Does that mean…

27:54.130 --> 27:55.507
Yeah, Sweet Tooth.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.384
We made it.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.761
We're in Colorado.

28:02.889 --> 28:03.973
[sighs]

28:05.350 --> 28:07.018
We made it to Colorado.

28:15.276 --> 28:18.697
All we have to figure out now
is where the hell GoGro is.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.241
[Jimmy] GoGro?

28:22.575 --> 28:23.952
Did you say GoGro?

28:24.703 --> 28:25.787
Yeah, you know it?

28:27.205 --> 28:28.415
Of course I know it.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.585
Well, where the hell is it?

28:33.837 --> 28:34.796
It…

28:36.172 --> 28:37.090
It's actually…

28:38.299 --> 28:39.134
It's, uh…

28:40.135 --> 28:41.469
Focus, Jimmy.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.513
No. I know I know it, it's…

28:44.222 --> 28:45.724
I hear it all the time.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.853
I'll check my cargo manifest. Yeah, yeah.

28:50.478 --> 28:51.813
[Jimmy exhales]

28:54.649 --> 28:56.735
-[Jepperd] G, as in GoGro.
-[Jimmy] GoGro.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.696
[exhales, chuckles]

28:59.779 --> 29:00.864
[giggles]

29:01.573 --> 29:02.449
I remember.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.867
It's short for Goss Grove,

29:03.950 --> 29:06.661
but nobody calls it that,
everyone calls it GoGro.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.705
It's a neighborhood outside of Essex City.

29:08.788 --> 29:11.249
-[Jepperd] That's the next stop.
-Thanks, other Big Man!

29:11.332 --> 29:12.417
[Jimmy] No worries, kid.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.753
-What's wrong?
-Last Men. On the train.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.297
What? What are Last Men
doing on this train?

29:17.380 --> 29:19.424
It's their charter, T.
I thought I told you that.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.176
You definitely did not
tell us that, Jimmy.

29:21.259 --> 29:24.387
They're moving operations south,
including the Choc-O-Rockets.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.346
General Abbot--

29:25.430 --> 29:26.598
Not important.

29:27.223 --> 29:30.393
-Where are they?
-In the next car, headed this way.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.352
Shit.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.980
Come on, let's take 'em. I'm done hiding.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.691
No. We don't know
how many of them there are.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.027
So what do we do?

29:39.736 --> 29:41.029
[exhales] Um…

29:42.155 --> 29:44.616
Follow me. Yeah.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.869
[suspenseful music builds]

30:12.060 --> 30:14.646
[Bear]
Uh, guys? There's nowhere else to go.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.399
I'll talk to 'em,
you guys stay out of sight.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.860
I'll tell them nobody's here,
they'll believe me.

30:20.944 --> 30:24.030
Jimmy, no offense, but you've never
been able to sweet-talk anybody.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.201
They're coming.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.455
We jump. It's our only option.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.793
[indistinct chatter]

30:43.174 --> 30:44.926
You gotta be shittin' me.

30:48.096 --> 30:48.972
[Gus] Jepp?

30:49.597 --> 30:50.890
What are we gonna do?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.193
We're gonna do something stupid.

31:16.916 --> 31:17.792
Hold it.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.461
[exhales]

31:22.130 --> 31:23.256
What's up, fellas?

31:24.507 --> 31:26.259
What are you doing here?

31:26.801 --> 31:30.430
Uh, you didn't hear? They--
We got a leak out back in the galley.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.348
It smells like gas.

31:32.432 --> 31:35.560
The caboose is off limits
until we can sort it out.

31:36.644 --> 31:37.896
Can't be too careful.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.772
The stove is electric.

31:42.358 --> 31:43.651
[inhales]

31:47.363 --> 31:48.239
What?

31:48.323 --> 31:49.449
The stove.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.452
It's electric. Not gas.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.123
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:59.500 --> 32:00.418
Jepperd.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.503
[music swells]

32:02.587 --> 32:03.546
Oops.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.258
-[Last Men clamoring]
-[clattering]

32:07.342 --> 32:09.218
-[Last Man 1] Get him! Get him!
-[door slams]

32:09.302 --> 32:11.304
What the hell did you do that for?

32:11.387 --> 32:12.472
[Last Man 1] Open this door!

32:13.056 --> 32:13.890
Dog!

32:13.973 --> 32:15.516
[banging on door]

32:16.351 --> 32:17.393
[Last Man 1] Bring the ax.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.271
-Jepperd! You hear me?
-[Jepperd grunts]

32:20.355 --> 32:22.315
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

32:22.398 --> 32:23.816
Jepperd, we gotta jump.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.862
No. Uh, take Gus.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.073
Jimmy and I will buy you some time.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.950
-No, we all go together.
-[banging on door]

32:32.033 --> 32:33.451
No, listen, Gus.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.286
No, Jepp. Together.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.747
[Last Man 1] Hey! I'm talking to you!

32:37.830 --> 32:40.124
-[banging on door]
-Listen to them, Tommy.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.754
I'mma buy you some time. I owe you
for taking all those hits for me.

32:44.837 --> 32:46.547
No, Jimmy.
They'll kill you for helping us.

32:46.631 --> 32:50.218
Let's face it, T.
You ain't the only one that's changed.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.261
My mind's never gonna be the same.

32:52.345 --> 32:56.683
But if I'm going out, I wanna be doing
the only thing I was ever good at.

33:03.773 --> 33:04.607
Go.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.110
-Be with your family.
-[Last Man 1] Jepperd!

33:07.193 --> 33:08.236
[mouthing] Go.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.279
[Last Man 1] Hey!

33:11.948 --> 33:13.282
Shit. Come on.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.119
[banging on door intensifies]

33:20.373 --> 33:22.000
Are we really gonna jump?

33:22.792 --> 33:24.043
Deep breath, Gus.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.754
Ready? Three, two, one…

33:26.838 --> 33:28.214
[Bear vocalizes]

33:29.757 --> 33:31.592
[Gus screams]

33:31.676 --> 33:34.012
[banging on door continues]

33:36.681 --> 33:39.434
[music swells]

33:39.517 --> 33:40.977
-[all grunting]
-[door clatters]

33:42.311 --> 33:44.105
-[Last Man 1] Where is he?
-Where's who?

33:44.188 --> 33:45.773
[Last Man 2] Check down there.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.608
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.735
What?

33:48.818 --> 33:50.403
So I can knock your lights out.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.989
[Last Men grunting]

33:53.072 --> 33:56.242
[train whistle blowing]

33:56.325 --> 33:59.078
[audience cheering]

33:59.162 --> 34:06.044
[announcer] Let's hear it
for Jimmy "Fat Man" Jacobs!

34:09.672 --> 34:13.051
[music builds, fades]

34:16.095 --> 34:18.097
[melancholic music]

34:28.691 --> 34:29.942
[sighs]

35:13.778 --> 35:16.572
[hybrids cooing]

35:17.698 --> 35:19.992
-[Aimee] Do you remember the plan?
-[Pigtail] Yeah.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.161
Follow the pipes. Hide in the church.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.539
Protect the others.
Wait until you come for us.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.958
-[Aimee] Good.
-Why aren't you coming now?

35:27.041 --> 35:30.211
I have to stay behind,
in case the bad men come.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.587
You shouldn't be alone.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.505
[Aimee] Pigtail,

35:33.089 --> 35:35.091
you need to look after the others.

35:36.008 --> 35:36.843
Hmm?

35:36.926 --> 35:39.011
What if I mess up?

35:39.095 --> 35:40.221
[Aimee] You won't.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.473
You remember when I said,

35:42.557 --> 35:45.601
"No matter what happens, you'll be strong,

35:45.685 --> 35:48.980
because you're Wendy.
Because you're my daughter."

35:51.065 --> 35:52.358
Go on now, go. Go.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.193
Promise you'll come for us?

35:54.861 --> 35:55.862
Cross my heart.

36:00.825 --> 36:01.826
[chuckles]

36:04.036 --> 36:04.996
Bobby ready.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.248
[Aimee] You have to get going.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.876
Just go.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.465
[narrator]
It's a difficult thing, letting go.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.347
It's tough to say goodbye.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.111
[Last Man 1] Hands, please.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.197
[acoustic guitar music playing]

36:49.874 --> 36:52.084
[indistinct chatter]

37:21.822 --> 37:23.783
[whispers] I just want to let you know,

37:24.951 --> 37:26.535
I let your horse go.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.790
She's free.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.046
[Dr. Singh] Thank you.

37:37.129 --> 37:38.965
[engine rumbling]

37:40.049 --> 37:41.092
[banging on roof]

37:48.307 --> 37:51.018
[narrator]
But the thing we don't always realize,

37:51.102 --> 37:52.603
when we let go of something…

37:52.687 --> 37:54.272
[Trixie neighing]

37:54.355 --> 37:56.232
…it opens up a little space

37:57.483 --> 37:58.401
to grow.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.536
It shows us who we are…

38:08.619 --> 38:10.288
[hybrids cooing]

38:10.371 --> 38:11.831
…what we're capable of.

38:17.753 --> 38:20.339
We find out what really matters,

38:21.173 --> 38:23.968
and who we really were, all along.

38:24.427 --> 38:30.433
[music intensifies]

38:33.019 --> 38:35.354
-[Jepperd] Hey, don't go too far off.
-[Gus] I won't.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.275
[Jepperd] Man.

38:39.358 --> 38:42.028
Hey, that was pretty cool,
what you did back there.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.196
Going back for Dog.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.532
What, you didn't think I had it in me?

38:47.533 --> 38:52.455
Hey, I know you're considering
going down south, but, uh…

38:53.456 --> 38:55.458
you can stick with us if you want.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.378
I'll think about it.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.298
[positive music playing]

39:02.381 --> 39:03.758
[Gus] Hey, you guys!

39:04.967 --> 39:05.843
What is it?

39:05.926 --> 39:08.429
I spy with my little eye

39:08.512 --> 39:11.974
something that begins with the letter E!

39:25.738 --> 39:28.449
-[Jepperd chuckles]
-[Gus] GoGro, here we come!

39:39.502 --> 39:42.963
