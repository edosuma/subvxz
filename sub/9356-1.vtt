31:30.456 --> 31:32.890
<i>one of these lucky girls</i>
<i>will be crowned</i>

31:32.959 --> 31:36.122
<i>your homecoming queen</i>
<i>of Lake Monroe High.</i>

31:36.195 --> 31:37.423
BOY: Yeah!

31:37.964 --> 31:39.431
<i>BURKLE: Thank you.</i>

31:41.667 --> 31:43.430
You vote for royalty here?

31:43.503 --> 31:45.733
We're a democracy. We're into voting.

31:45.805 --> 31:50.333
So then, anyone can be a princess?
Even you?

31:51.878 --> 31:53.505
Theoretically.

31:55.781 --> 31:58.306
Excuse me, everyone.
May I have your attention?

31:58.384 --> 32:00.215
- What are you doing? Sit down!
- No, no.

32:00.286 --> 32:04.222
I would like to nominate my cousin,
Carter Mason, to be your queen.

32:05.191 --> 32:08.354
I think that she would
make an excellent ruler.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.894
(SPARSE LAUGHTER)

32:09.962 --> 32:11.293
BOY 1: (WHOOPS) Carter?

32:12.865 --> 32:14.264
BOY 2: Yeah, right.

32:15.034 --> 32:19.130
- Carter. Carter!
- GIRL: Carter? That's hilarious.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.497
Was that for real? Wow!

32:22.775 --> 32:23.969
ED: Oh, man.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.201
Looks like I'm the queen.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.442
ROSALINDA: Carter!

32:30.683 --> 32:32.981
- Carter!
- Leave me alone.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.917
I order you to stop.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.050
You order me? You order me.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.650
I order you to take a long walk
off a short pier.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.490
You cannot order me to do anything.

32:43.563 --> 32:44.996
Wanna bet?
You're in my kingdom now.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.929
Okay, hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.090
Whoa, what's going on?

32:48.167 --> 32:51.136
Dad, she can't do it.
She can't act normal.

32:51.571 --> 32:53.630
- I am normal.
- Really? Okay.

32:53.706 --> 32:56.732
So, a normal person who has
never seen a hamburger before

32:56.809 --> 32:58.674
can order one in six languages?

32:58.744 --> 33:00.041
Really? You did that?

33:00.112 --> 33:01.943
I always speak to my staff
in their native tongue.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.676
They're not your staff.
They're lunch ladies, okay?

33:04.750 --> 33:06.479
Dad, can't you see
that this isn't gonna work?

33:06.552 --> 33:10.682
Carter, it's gonna work, okay?
We just have to give it a little time.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.515
(CARTER GRUNTS)

33:17.129 --> 33:18.596
It'll work.

<i>MAN ON RADIO:</i>
<i>It's gonna be a scorcher again today...</i>

33:57.236 --> 33:58.225
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hi, Carter.

33:58.304 --> 33:59.999
- Hello.
- Oh, great.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.973
Good morning, Carter.
What are you doing?

34:03.042 --> 34:04.339
Chores.

34:05.077 --> 34:09.103
- Chores? I do not understand.
- No, of course not.

34:09.949 --> 34:13.407
Perhaps I could learn this "chores."
You could teach me.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.415
You know, that's the best idea
you've had.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.821
What must I do?

34:18.891 --> 34:21.518
We'll start you off easy. Inventory.

34:21.594 --> 34:23.755
- Inventory?
- Counting.

34:25.531 --> 34:31.469
You count what's in here,
and put it in here. Have fun.

34:32.271 --> 34:36.469
Oh! And when you're done,
there's a whole other shelf, too.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.150
One.

34:59.699 --> 35:03.100
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Just peachy.

35:04.637 --> 35:06.605
- You got the bow?
- Uh-huh.

35:06.672 --> 35:07.934
Stay above that line.

35:08.007 --> 35:09.941
- What line?
- Right there.

35:10.009 --> 35:11.203
Okay.

35:17.083 --> 35:20.052
(CLATTERING)

35:20.419 --> 35:23.445
Carter, what's Rosie doing
in the bait shop?

35:23.522 --> 35:24.955
Chores.

35:25.024 --> 35:26.491
(ROSALINDA SCREAMS)

35:26.559 --> 35:27.617
Dad.

35:28.561 --> 35:29.755
JOE: Rosie!

35:30.496 --> 35:33.590
- CARTER: Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.259
I think I need to bathe.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.942
Carter, why don't you go on
in and clean this up, okay?

35:44.543 --> 35:48.445
- Why me? She's the one who did it.
- Come on, pal. I'll help you.

35:48.514 --> 35:51.415
- All right, it... It's not funny.
- (GIGGLING) Yes. Come on.

35:51.484 --> 35:53.179
- You know it's a little funny.
- All right. Here. Go.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.719
- You wanna laugh, too.
- No, I don't wanna laugh.

35:54.787 --> 35:56.186
- Yes, you do.
- This is serious. Come on.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.454
- What do you want for dinner tonight?
- Pizza.

36:00.526 --> 36:04.394
Pizza? We had pizza last night.
How about... How about burgers?

36:04.463 --> 36:06.829
How about this? Pizza and burgers.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.899
- Pizza and burgers.
- Yeah. I wanna do both.

36:08.968 --> 36:12.369
- One as an appetizer, or just together?
- I don't know.

36:16.575 --> 36:19.635
I didn't know we still
had all that stuff.

36:19.712 --> 36:22.237
- What's all this?
- A proper dinner.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.781
To thank you for helping me
clean up the mess

36:23.849 --> 36:26.044
that I made in your shop of bugs.

36:26.118 --> 36:27.949
- It's bait.
- I'm aware.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.446
Okay.

36:33.092 --> 36:35.083
- Here. Let me.
- No, no.

36:35.161 --> 36:37.789
Thank you, but tonight, I serve you.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.559
Well, I'm not gonna say no to that.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.858
It is for you.

36:41.934 --> 36:43.333
- For me?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.030
To wear. Okay. Fine.

36:46.105 --> 36:47.094
(SNICKERS)

36:48.007 --> 36:49.736
Come on, Carter.

36:52.111 --> 36:55.979
So, you cook?
I thought you had servants for that.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.640
Actually, my mother grew up a peasant.

36:57.716 --> 36:58.978
(MOUTHING)

36:59.051 --> 37:01.315
So she taught me many family recipes.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

37:10.796 --> 37:11.820
Wow!

37:11.897 --> 37:13.728
Yeah, that sounds kind of fancy.

37:13.799 --> 37:17.394
- Why don't we just order pizza?
- No, it's chicken and rice.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.767
Fantastic. Bring it on, Rosie.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.167
(JOE CHUCKLES)

37:21.240 --> 37:23.902
You know, I haven't had
a real home-cooked meal since...

37:23.976 --> 37:25.375
Forever.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.775
Right.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.241
Let's dig in!

37:33.285 --> 37:34.650
- How do you like it?
- That...

37:34.720 --> 37:37.883
That is really, really good.
Gee, I had no idea you can cook.

37:37.957 --> 37:41.085
- Thank you.
- This is terrific. You're wonderful.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.394
Thank you. Would you like a roll?

37:44.463 --> 37:46.294
- You made rolls, too?
- ROSALINDA: Yes.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.560
- I had no idea.
- Yes.

37:49.668 --> 37:50.657
Wow!

37:50.970 --> 37:53.700
Must be nice to play peasant for a day.

37:58.077 --> 37:59.977
Would you excuse me?

38:28.807 --> 38:31.002
You do not know me, Carter.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.144
What's the big deal?

38:34.213 --> 38:36.078
You'll be back with your servants

38:36.148 --> 38:39.743
and your personal chef
and private tutors soon enough.

38:43.923 --> 38:46.687
How much did your father
tell you about me?

38:46.759 --> 38:49.728
Other than the obvious,
I think we're on a need-to-know basis.

38:49.795 --> 38:54.858
I think you need to know that my name
is Rosalinda Marie Montoya Fiore,

38:54.934 --> 38:57.994
- and I am a royal princess.
- (SCOFFS) No kidding.

38:58.070 --> 39:01.335
I am from a small island nation
called Costa Luna.

39:01.407 --> 39:04.376
- Never heard of it.
- It is not on most maps.

39:04.677 --> 39:08.272
It is very small,
very unimportant to large countries,

39:08.347 --> 39:10.838
but very important to me.

39:22.461 --> 39:25.328
When my father died,
he left Costa Luna to me.

39:29.635 --> 39:30.795
You don't have to tell me...

39:30.869 --> 39:34.236
One month before my coronation,
our palace was attacked.

39:34.306 --> 39:37.901
Your father was very brave.

39:37.977 --> 39:39.968
He risked his life for you, I know.

39:40.045 --> 39:43.674
That's his job. He rescues
poor, oppressed princesses.

39:44.917 --> 39:48.148
Did he tell you we had
to leave my mother behind?

39:48.220 --> 39:52.054
The man who invaded Costa Luna
now holds her as a hostage.

39:54.093 --> 39:55.117
I didn't know.

39:55.194 --> 39:56.855
They told me
my becoming Rosie González

39:56.929 --> 39:58.954
was the only way to keep her safe.

39:59.031 --> 40:00.999
Stop. It's okay.

40:01.066 --> 40:05.025
Carter, whatever I did to make
you dislike me, I am truly sorry.

40:05.104 --> 40:09.803
I will try to blend in.
I will try to be from Iowa.

40:12.211 --> 40:15.203
It is the only way
to save my mother's life.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.753
Let's just start over.

40:22.755 --> 40:24.552
I would like that.

40:24.623 --> 40:27.353
But you need to lighten up
on this princess stuff.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.688
It's really annoying.

40:28.761 --> 40:33.494
Absolutely. Please, I only want
to be this typical American teenager.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.659
You know what?
I think we can arrange that.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.009
I love this place! What is it?

40:46.712 --> 40:49.579
It's a bowling alley. That's bowling.

40:49.648 --> 40:53.744
Just do what I do and don't draw
any attention to yourself, please.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.081
Right.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.054
- Thank you.
- Sure.

41:02.628 --> 41:05.062
- Carter! How you doing?
- Hi, Ed.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.361
- ED: Hi. How you doing, Rosie?
- I'm well, thank you.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.928
- What'll it be?
- Bowling, please.

41:12.004 --> 41:13.596
(CHUCKLES) No kidding.

41:16.742 --> 41:18.835
Five-and-a-half coming up.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.474
- Thank you.
- Sure.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.210
- What size?
- Excuse me?

41:26.952 --> 41:29.182
Your feet. What size?

41:29.254 --> 41:30.243
(STAMMERING)

41:30.322 --> 41:33.314
I do not know.
All of my shoes are made for me.

41:33.392 --> 41:35.986
There's a shock.
Just get her some shoes.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.392
Okay.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.075
Your Highness.

42:02.154 --> 42:04.019
ROSALINDA: Why, thank you, Edward.

42:05.023 --> 42:09.483
- It's Edwin, actually.
- Edwin. That is a wonderful name.

42:09.561 --> 42:13.759
Thank you. It's been
a pleasure serving you, milady.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.027
All right. Thank you, Romeo.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.029
Okay.

42:18.971 --> 42:21.439
You're not blending in. Pick a ball.

42:21.507 --> 42:22.599
Did you see that?

42:22.674 --> 42:26.735
- Yeah. Nobody ever does that for us.
- They do now.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.104
(CHELSEA CLEARS THROAT)

42:29.181 --> 42:32.116
- Your shoe's untied.
- Don't trip.

42:38.423 --> 42:39.515
DONNY: Oh!

42:41.894 --> 42:43.486
Careful there.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.563
Donny, you don't have
to carry that for her.

42:52.638 --> 42:55.368
She can do it herself
like a normal person.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.773
- So I'll just take this.
- DONNY: Whatever you say...

43:00.345 --> 43:02.643
- Carter.
- Right.

43:07.352 --> 43:11.254
- So, Donny is your boyfriend?
- What? No, no. He's just a friend.

43:11.323 --> 43:13.348
ROSALINDA:
But he is very special to you.

43:13.425 --> 43:17.623
I see the way you look at him.
It's the same way that Ed looks at you.

43:18.297 --> 43:22.131
Okay, you're obviously not from here,
so just bowl. You first.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.830
How do I win?

43:24.903 --> 43:27.997
You win by knocking down
those white pins.

43:28.740 --> 43:30.571
Okay, I'm ready.

43:32.244 --> 43:35.372
- What?
- You may fire at the target.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.840
You may fire it yourself.

43:47.659 --> 43:49.149
(PINS CLATTERING)

43:56.969 --> 43:58.527
Impossible.

43:59.771 --> 44:01.500
Nice shot, Rosie!

44:20.726 --> 44:22.455
You done already, Carter?

44:22.527 --> 44:25.428
Yeah. Our lane's
getting a little crowded.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.469
You don't really like your cousin,
do you?

44:31.536 --> 44:38.305
No, it's... It's just...
She can be sometimes, you know, a...

44:38.377 --> 44:40.572
Princess. She could win it all.

44:40.646 --> 44:42.637
She is getting really popular.

44:42.714 --> 44:46.480
The vote is on Monday. We can't
let her get more popular than we are.

44:46.551 --> 44:49.918
There's only one thing to do
in a situation like this.

44:49.988 --> 44:55.324
Excuse me! Excuse me! Roe!
Excuse me! Excuse me! Roe.

44:55.394 --> 44:59.057
You are such a natural.
Will you show us how to bowl like that?

44:59.131 --> 45:04.034
- Of course. But my name is Rosie.
- Oh! Roe's our nickname we gave you.

45:04.102 --> 45:06.593
We give all of our friends nicknames.
She's Chels.

45:06.672 --> 45:10.335
And she's Brookie and you're Roe.
You're one of us now.

45:15.447 --> 45:17.176
ROSALINDA: Carter?
CARTER: What?

45:17.249 --> 45:19.717
Why do you care so much
for this boy Donny?

45:19.785 --> 45:21.616
Who says I care for him?

45:24.089 --> 45:27.752
Fine. I've been totally in love with him
since, like, the third grade,

45:27.826 --> 45:29.293
when he kissed me
under the basketball hoop.

45:29.361 --> 45:31.727
- Is that what you want to hear?
- He is quite beautiful.

45:31.797 --> 45:33.594
Much like a prince.

45:34.299 --> 45:37.496
I wonder if he is
beautiful on the inside as well.

45:39.171 --> 45:43.540
- Shall we bowl again tomorrow?
- I can't. I'm working at the bait shack.

45:43.809 --> 45:45.572
I've never worked before.
Is this normal?

45:45.644 --> 45:47.805
Yes. Lots of kids have jobs.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.972
- Then I will help you.
- You can't.

45:50.048 --> 45:51.709
- Why not?
- Because it's mine.

45:51.783 --> 45:54.513
You can't have everything that's mine!

45:54.586 --> 45:58.352
Well, just... Want a job so bad?
Just go get one yourself.

46:00.792 --> 46:02.123
All right.

01:27:31.113 --> 01:27:32.478
- I am.
- Me, too.

01:27:32.548 --> 01:27:34.106

a little bit warmer?

01:27:34.183 --> 01:27:36.515

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:43.350

01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.952

01:27:45.027 --> 01:27:46.494
<i>AUTOMATED VOICE: Door opening.</i>
