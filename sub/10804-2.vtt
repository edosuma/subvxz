WEBVTT

00:20.647 --> 00:22.398
Good. Stay there.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.358
Matt?

00:24.442 --> 00:27.195
No. I haven't seen him since last night.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.364
I'll let him know what's going on.
Meet you at the precinct.

00:30.448 --> 00:33.326
And don't let anyone
talk to Grotto until then.

00:33.409 --> 00:34.994
It was a normal evening
at Metro-General

00:35.078 --> 00:38.289
when a lone gunman entered
and began firing into the crowd.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.792
Most of the patients are being moved
to other area hospitals.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.044
- Investigators say...

00:47.757 --> 00:50.384
The building's clear.
Perp is not in the building.

00:50.468 --> 00:53.722
Standby to lift lockdown.
All units hold position.

00:53.805 --> 00:57.141
We have a report of shots fired earlier
on a rooftop up on 10th.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.398
- Yeah?
- I lost my keys!

01:34.512 --> 01:36.973
- Your kid locked you out?
- Yeah.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.725
You some kind of idiot?

01:40.268 --> 01:41.394
Yeah.

02:03.041 --> 02:04.042
Oh, shit.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.629
No, no, no, no, no.
No! Matt!

02:07.712 --> 02:09.547
Come on, Matt, wake up.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.382
You okay, Matt? Come on.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.635
Get up! Matt! Matt, come on!

02:13.718 --> 02:15.637
Wake up. Wake up!

02:16.595 --> 02:17.806
Come on!

02:19.223 --> 02:21.685
Matt, can you breathe?

02:23.812 --> 02:25.772
Matt. Can you get up?

03:48.980 --> 03:51.941
Hey, Foggy, can I get some aspirin?

03:53.902 --> 03:56.946
You sure you don't want an x-ray?
Maybe a psych eval?

03:57.030 --> 03:58.489
An aspirin's fine, buddy.

04:00.784 --> 04:03.536
You got shot in the head.
You're lucky you're not in the morgue.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.663
It was just
a dumb mistake, man.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.167
-What?
-The gun on his ankle, I...

04:09.250 --> 04:13.462
I should've heard it, you know.
I should've felt it.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.089
- Are you serious?

04:15.173 --> 04:17.550
Yeah, but he's fast,
this guy, Foggy, he's...

04:18.676 --> 04:19.803
He's trained.

04:19.886 --> 04:21.720
He's a lunatic, Matt.

04:21.805 --> 04:24.223
I went to the hospital.
I saw what he did.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.893
-Where's Karen?
-We've been through this.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.103
Oh, yeah, that's right.

04:29.187 --> 04:31.189
Yeah, you're sure...
you're sure she's okay?

04:31.272 --> 04:33.441
She got Grotto to the NYPD.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.651
We're gonna meet there,
make a deal with the DA.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.446
Thanks.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.875
Thanks, buddy.
I'm gonna put on some pants.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.836
-No.
-It's okay. I know we need to get going.

04:52.919 --> 04:54.045
"We" don't need to do anything.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.797
-Foggy, I don't wanna do this right now.
-Karen's safe,

04:55.880 --> 04:57.298
you're safe...

04:57.381 --> 04:59.258
and our client will be safe
within the hour.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.927
-It's all taken care of.
-Except the shooter.

05:01.010 --> 05:02.761
He's still walking the streets
of Hell's Kitchen.

05:02.846 --> 05:05.223
-He's the cops' problem now.
-He's gonna plow right through the cops.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.307
I know what you're doing.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.725
You saw what he did to the Irish,

05:07.809 --> 05:09.018
you didn't see what he did
to the Mexican Cartel.

05:09.102 --> 05:11.855
He hung them on meat hooks,
and he left them there to die.

05:11.938 --> 05:13.522
-You want another round.
-Blood is being shed, Foggy.

05:13.606 --> 05:15.942
And you've donated
more than your fair share to the cause.

05:16.025 --> 05:19.778
-I need to stop him.
-You need to get rest. Okay?

05:19.863 --> 05:22.031
And when you wake up,
you need to consider

05:22.115 --> 05:25.493
putting that thing back
in whatever wacko box it came from.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.162
Better yet...

05:36.921 --> 05:37.922
Let go.

05:38.006 --> 05:39.423
You first.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.803
I don't wanna do this again.

05:44.888 --> 05:45.889
Then don't.

05:45.972 --> 05:48.266
You know what would've happened
if someone caught us stumbling home?

05:48.349 --> 05:51.810
-You wearing that thing?
-I appreciate it, Foggy.

05:51.895 --> 05:53.812
-You taking care of me.
-You should.

05:53.897 --> 05:56.232
But when the cops
try to take this guy down,

05:56.315 --> 05:58.651
it's gonna be one hell of a fight,
lives are gonna be lost.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.238
This guy's not gonna go down easy.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.034
- I need to help.

06:07.076 --> 06:08.411
You look like shit.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.081
Stay here. Get rest.

06:12.165 --> 06:15.876
We don't need people asking questions
we don't have answers to.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.171
I've covered for you enough as it is.

06:20.631 --> 06:25.428
And for now, let the NYPD
and the DA do their jobs.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.306
And trust me to do mine!

06:29.348 --> 06:30.474
Okay?

07:05.969 --> 07:07.511
That window bulletproof?

07:10.348 --> 07:13.684
Twenty cops outside that door.
You're safe.

07:14.978 --> 07:16.187
Where the hell are your boys?

07:16.270 --> 07:17.646
On their way.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.690
Place of birth?

07:19.773 --> 07:20.942
Queens.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.321
Relatives? Anyone we should place
into Witness Protection with you?

07:25.404 --> 07:26.780
No. I got no one.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.660
You don't seem rattled.

07:31.744 --> 07:34.122
A guy tries to blow your head off,
you ain't scared?

07:37.959 --> 07:38.960
I'm terrified.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.967
-Sorry. Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Mmm.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.094
The paperwork's almost done
and Brett's gonna be in in a minute.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.512
Where's Murdock?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.347
He took a sick day.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.436
You told us the Irish were attacked
by a whole gang of guys.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.938
I'm pretty sure
the word you used was "army."

08:00.023 --> 08:01.232
You want to tell me
why I'm now hearing

08:01.315 --> 08:02.566
this is all being done by one man?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.360
-Look, I didn't know you guys were--
-Who does he work for?

08:04.443 --> 08:05.944
-I got no idea!
-Well, what do you know?

08:06.029 --> 08:07.530
I know he's a sociopath, that's what.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.241
I mean, yeah, fine...

08:10.324 --> 08:12.826
I heard the rumors, okay,
but I didn't think...

08:13.995 --> 08:16.330
I thought it was ridiculous, okay?

08:16.414 --> 08:18.291
Ten, 20 guys could be
mowed down at a time.

08:18.374 --> 08:20.418
And with precision?
You know, tactically.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.921
Every hit was like
some kind of SEAL Team 6.

08:24.005 --> 08:26.840
Then people started saying
it was one guy doing all that.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.967
One man?
I thought it was a ghost story.

08:29.052 --> 08:31.220
Some...

08:31.304 --> 08:35.266
campfire shit you tell freshies
to make 'em crap their pants.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.351
But now...

08:37.435 --> 08:38.644
You saw.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.272
- That guy was the Grim Reaper.

08:42.065 --> 08:44.525
Mr. Grote, I'm Sergeant Mahoney.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.360
Got some clothes here for you.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.196
What? Am I arrested?

08:49.197 --> 08:51.574
Just protective custody
until we can figure out WITSEC.

08:51.657 --> 08:52.658
Why the peel?

08:52.741 --> 08:54.285
Or stay in the gown
with your ass hangin' out,

08:54.368 --> 08:56.329
-I don't care.
-Yeah.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.747
We pulled the security footage
from the hospital.

08:58.831 --> 09:01.084
-I got ten men going over it right now.
-Any leads?

09:01.167 --> 09:02.626
I was hoping you had something.

09:03.461 --> 09:05.963
Let's let him change. You two wanna
step outside with me for a sec?

09:19.727 --> 09:21.479
Now, the DA's office
is sending someone over

09:21.562 --> 09:23.356
to talk you through
Witness Protection options.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.023
-Today?
-Yeah, right now.

09:25.108 --> 09:27.860
And listen,
take whatever deal they offer, okay?

09:27.943 --> 09:29.445
You don't wanna mess with this psycho.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.029
So you do have a lead.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.158
I ever tell you what Clemons used to say?

09:34.242 --> 09:36.952
Gotta treat witnesses like mushrooms.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.164
Feed 'em shit, and keep 'em in the dark.

09:40.248 --> 09:41.749
That scum's on a need to know.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.959
So fill us in.
Who's bankrolling this guy?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.169
Who does he work for?

09:45.253 --> 09:47.088
The DA's office says
the shooter's independent.

09:47.171 --> 09:50.258
Vigilante type,
targeting different crime families.

09:50.341 --> 09:54.178
And not in a... a Daredevil way.
In a Death Wish way.

09:54.262 --> 09:55.429
-Holy shit.
-Yeah.

09:55.513 --> 09:58.391
Daredevil kicks ass, this whole city
cheers like we just won the World Series.

09:58.474 --> 09:59.850
But this guy?

09:59.933 --> 10:02.270
He does it, and the streets get bloody.

10:02.353 --> 10:06.649
Makes everybody stop and think twice
about the whole "hero" proposition.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.526
Well, what do you think?

10:08.609 --> 10:09.860
The whole force is split.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.987
Some cops want him off the street,

10:12.070 --> 10:14.198
others think he's making our jobs
a whole lot easier.

10:14.282 --> 10:16.450
But if you ask me,
it's only a matter of time

10:16.534 --> 10:18.911
before the wrong person
gets caught in the crossfire.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.874
Yeah, you put it that way,
I guess copycats were inevitable.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.710
No, it's not the first, just the latest.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.213
Yeah, we call them "Devil Worshippers."

10:29.297 --> 10:32.800
Nutjobs inspired by
the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

10:32.883 --> 10:36.304
Shit, most of 'em are just
ineffectual idiots, but this guy...

10:36.387 --> 10:39.307
all my years on the force,
I've never seen anything like him.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.919
Oh.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.422
Shit, it's not an assistant,
it's the actual DA.

12:34.505 --> 12:35.923
That's Reyes?

12:36.006 --> 12:38.551
In all her
defense-attorney-destroying glory.

12:38.634 --> 12:39.968
How do I look?

12:40.052 --> 12:41.679
Uh, semi-professional.

12:42.305 --> 12:45.182
-No, Foggy, I'm kidding. You'll be fine.
-Okay.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.850
Are they the ones that brought in Grote?

12:46.934 --> 12:49.269
Um, Franklin Nelson,
of Nelson and Murdock.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.815
This is my associate, Karen Page.

12:52.898 --> 12:55.734
Officers, I want you to prepare
Mr. Grote for transport.

12:55.818 --> 12:58.070
Excuse me,
but, transport where, exactly?

12:58.153 --> 12:59.196
Once he's in our custody,

12:59.279 --> 13:01.407
I want you to personally
handle all the arrangements.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.658
Just to put it out there,

13:02.741 --> 13:05.536
our client's already given us
a list of his conditions.

13:07.204 --> 13:11.208
Mr. Nelson, have you ever negotiated
a witness protection agreement?

13:11.834 --> 13:13.961
Well... speaking for my firm,

13:14.044 --> 13:16.339
I can attest that
we're all very fast learners.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.509
The District Attorney
appreciates your efforts,

13:20.593 --> 13:22.678
but our office will be
handling the case from here.

13:22.761 --> 13:25.138
Excuse me. Grotto is our client.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.099
And it would be in
Mr. Grote's best interest

13:27.182 --> 13:28.392
for you to recuse yourselves

13:28.476 --> 13:30.894
so he can bring in a legal team
with more expertise.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.480
You mean someone
you can push around.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.691
We had enough expertise
to handle Wilson Fisk.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.444
I'll say this once, Mr. Nelson.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.321
If, God willing,
your firm doesn't collapse

13:41.405 --> 13:43.366
under the weight of the chickens
and the fruit baskets

13:43.449 --> 13:46.452
you've been collecting
from your indigent clientele,

13:46.535 --> 13:48.746
there will come a time
when you need to ask a favor

13:48.829 --> 13:50.456
of the District Attorney's office.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.376
And depending on how
this situation resolves,

13:53.459 --> 13:57.838
that favor will either be forthcoming
or permanently withheld.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.008
Am I making myself clear?

14:01.091 --> 14:02.676
Of course.

14:03.469 --> 14:04.512
Now...

14:04.595 --> 14:05.721
if we're through?

14:08.516 --> 14:11.644
I'm sorry. Just one sec.

14:11.727 --> 14:12.936
About that favor...

14:13.020 --> 14:16.899
you wouldn't happen to have the number
for the U.S. Attorney's office?

14:18.150 --> 14:19.943
Oh, never mind, I got it.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.905
Uh, U.S. Department of Justice...

14:22.988 --> 14:25.574
Office of Enforcement Operations.

14:25.658 --> 14:26.950
What the hell are you doing?

14:27.034 --> 14:29.662
- Zealously protecting my client's rights.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.456
Local DA's don't have jurisdiction
over the witness protection program.

14:32.540 --> 14:36.168
That's solely determined by the
U.S. Attorney's office, a.k.a. the Feds,

14:36.251 --> 14:38.045
who are probably
just as douchey as you are,

14:38.128 --> 14:39.755
but at least they can
deliver on their promises...

14:41.006 --> 14:42.090
and their threats.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.969
Since this really isn't
working out between us,

14:46.053 --> 14:49.222
maybe I should just
deal with them directly.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.809
Kudos, by the way.
The cell service in here is awesome.

14:52.685 --> 14:53.686
Hang up.

14:53.769 --> 14:54.895
- Attorney General's office.
- One second.

14:54.978 --> 14:58.065
Yes, hi. Uh...
This is Franklin Nelson.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.567
-Spell it.
-Uh, yes, uh...

14:59.650 --> 15:01.318
-N-E-L--
-Hang up.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.907
What do you want?

15:07.533 --> 15:09.702
As I see it,
the District Attorney's office

15:09.785 --> 15:11.328
would like to receive
credit for any arrests

15:11.412 --> 15:12.871
that arise from Mr. Grote's testimony.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.583
And my client, on the other hand,
could definitely use

15:15.666 --> 15:18.001
the enthusiastic endorsement
of the New York DA

15:18.085 --> 15:20.253
when entering in his witpro agreement.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.173
In either case, he'll be requiring
legal representation,

15:23.256 --> 15:26.760
which will be provided
by the law firm of Nelson and Murdock.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.679
To put it in layman's terms...

15:28.762 --> 15:31.014
cut the shit, lady.
You're dealing with us.

15:33.601 --> 15:37.605
Let's find out if their low-life client
is even worth it.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.151
- Oh, Foggy...

15:43.235 --> 15:45.613
-that was amazing.
-That was just round one.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.366
I'll keep it simple.

15:49.450 --> 15:51.118
Give me a deal, put up a camera,

15:51.201 --> 15:53.912
I'll tell you everything
about those Irish pricks.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.999
Names, dates, their favorite titty-bars...

15:57.082 --> 15:58.709
That's not good enough.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.377
That's what he's got.

16:00.461 --> 16:04.381
Most of Mr. Grote's mob friends
are either dead or fleeing the country.

16:04.465 --> 16:06.675
If you want this office's endorsement,

16:06.759 --> 16:09.136
you'll have to give us someone
who's still breathing.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.846
What-- So how does my client manage that?

16:10.929 --> 16:13.849
We would like Mr. Grote to wear a wire
to meet one of his old associates.

16:13.932 --> 16:17.185
Our files show your organization
has had dealings with one Edgar Brass.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.647
Brass. You're out of your goddamn mind!

16:19.730 --> 16:21.189
- Grotto, calm down.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.275
-We need a second with our client.
-Fine.

16:25.736 --> 16:26.987
Who's Edgar Brass?

16:27.070 --> 16:29.532
Drug-dealing butcher
who's worse by a mile.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.241
They send me after him,
I'm as good as dead.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.576
--I get it, I do,

16:32.660 --> 16:35.287
but chances are,
the Feds are gonna ask for the same thing.

16:38.832 --> 16:39.875
Why Grotto?

16:39.958 --> 16:42.711
Because we know your client
has worked with Brass before.

16:43.879 --> 16:44.880
You got an in.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.007
If he could get Brass to talk,

16:47.090 --> 16:49.467
he would be instrumental
in taking down a major drug ring.

16:49.552 --> 16:51.094
If I don't?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.387
Then you're free to walk away.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.559
But don't expect to get very far.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.942
Oh, God.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.318
What the hell is that?

17:06.401 --> 17:08.779
You could call it "work product."

17:08.862 --> 17:13.366
Morgue reports generated by the shooter
who attacked you in the hospital.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.369
And all of these people were...
were killed by the same man?

17:16.453 --> 17:18.163
He's tracking gangs to their home turf

17:18.246 --> 17:20.207
and taking them out
with military precision.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.584
But it doesn't stop there.

17:21.667 --> 17:22.793
What do you mean, "doesn't stop"?

17:22.876 --> 17:24.502
His targets aren't random,
Mr. Grote.

17:24.587 --> 17:27.005
He knows exactly who he wants to hit.

17:27.089 --> 17:30.508
And if any of his intended marks
are lucky enough to escape...

17:30.593 --> 17:33.637
Say they're off buying a sandwich,
or in bed with the flu...

17:34.512 --> 17:36.599
recuperating under an assumed name

17:36.682 --> 17:37.850
at Metro-General...

17:37.933 --> 17:41.353
Sooner or later,
he gets to them, too.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.900
Jesus Christ.

17:46.984 --> 17:50.571
My office is offering you
a chance to save yourself.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.531
Whether you take it, is up to you.

17:53.616 --> 17:56.034
And your, uh... legal team.

18:01.832 --> 18:02.958
Reyes.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.504
And the police have
no idea who's doing this?

18:07.588 --> 18:09.214
It's an ongoing investigation.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.467
But our intelligence people
are close to completing a profile.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.636
A profile?

18:13.719 --> 18:15.095
- Even got a code name.
- Like what?

18:15.178 --> 18:18.015
-"Killdozer," or "Dumbass With A Gun"?
-Not quite.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.975
They're calling this one...

18:20.058 --> 18:21.518
"the Punisher."

18:28.776 --> 18:32.404
Check out the phone, man.
That's a brand new Ikea.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.156
Idiot.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.453
Oh, I suppose this is yours too?

18:40.537 --> 18:42.039
What do you care?

18:42.122 --> 18:44.082
A hundred in trade, come on, man.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.969
Go on, get the hell out of here.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.054
Go ahead.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.392
Shit.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.734
Do I know you?

19:10.818 --> 19:13.528
I need an NYPD mobile communications rig.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.156
One that gets
encrypted tactical frequencies.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.783
What do I look like, RadioShack?

19:19.201 --> 19:21.912
Anyway, dealing in this shit is illegal.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.963
Sure you're not a cop?
'Cause that's trouble I don't need.

19:31.922 --> 19:33.423
-Yeah...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:33.506 --> 19:35.718
I gotta ask, right?

19:35.801 --> 19:37.010
Just hold on.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.105
Yep.

19:48.981 --> 19:52.442
Straight outta
Officer McDipshit's dashboard.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.988
Gets your tactical bands,
surveillance feeds.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.573
Hell, it'll probably pick up
the mayor banging his boyfriend.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.326
It's a grand.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.536
We're talking about
a one-of-a-kind item.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.131
Video tape.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.345
Sure. What the hell.

20:21.764 --> 20:23.766
What about the double-barrel
under the counter?

21:01.719 --> 21:03.555
Hey, man, hold on.
Sure I can't get you anything else?

21:03.638 --> 21:06.308
You know, I got it all, man.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.392
Yeah, bondage...

21:07.475 --> 21:09.895
back-door, grannies,

21:09.978 --> 21:12.105
or maybe you're in the market
for something younger?

21:12.189 --> 21:14.817
She's barely 12.
Guaranteed.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.031
You like that, huh?

21:21.114 --> 21:23.408
For 100 bucks, she's all yours.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.040
That's my man.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.346
What the hell are you doin'?

21:46.264 --> 21:48.683
Hey, man, just take it easy.

21:51.937 --> 21:54.147
I'm just trying to make a buck!

21:55.648 --> 21:56.942
Thank you, Ms. Kwan.

21:57.025 --> 21:59.194
Yeah, and it shouldn't be
too much longer now.

21:59.277 --> 22:03.740
And yes, we very much
appreciate the kimchi.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.367
Okay. Bye.

22:07.452 --> 22:08.954
Anything else we've been ignoring?

22:09.787 --> 22:11.706
Uh, yeah. Um...

22:14.501 --> 22:15.668
There you go.

22:15.752 --> 22:16.837
Thank you.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.007
"Overdue."

22:20.090 --> 22:21.424
"Past due."

22:21.508 --> 22:23.176
"Final notice."

22:24.219 --> 22:27.264
Hey! "First notice." That's a win.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.806
Karen?

22:36.523 --> 22:37.690
What are you working on?

22:37.774 --> 22:40.235
-Um, the morgue reports.
-What?

22:40.318 --> 22:42.612
Uh, you know,
the stuff the DA showed us.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.240
I'm just running searches
on the names in the databases.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.324
Karen...

22:48.911 --> 22:51.246
I could have been
one of these people, Foggy.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.417
-He was after Grotto.
-I know.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.920
But how long can I tell myself
this is just bad luck?

22:59.046 --> 23:00.838
Fisk? And now this guy?

23:00.923 --> 23:02.840
I mean, what if I'm
drawing this stuff my way?

23:02.925 --> 23:05.052
You're not.
You're gonna be fine.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.887
-"Punisher" is just a nickname.
-Yeah, well, what if I deserve it?

23:07.971 --> 23:09.097
What are you talking about?

23:12.184 --> 23:13.893
Nothing. I just...

23:17.189 --> 23:18.815
None of this feels real, I guess.

23:18.941 --> 23:21.609
That asshole opened fire in a hospital.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.112
You're not the one
who deserves to be punished.

23:25.989 --> 23:29.742
And plus, you got away,
which kind of makes you awesome.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.996
I guess.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.583
Coffee?

23:36.666 --> 23:37.792
I'm buying.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.627
In that case, okay.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.011
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.598
I'm coming, I'm coming.

24:34.849 --> 24:35.850
Hey.

24:35.933 --> 24:36.934
Hey.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.396
Sorry, you startled me.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.314
I didn't mean to.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.526
-Come in.
-Uh, sure?

24:44.609 --> 24:45.735
Of course.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.903
Okay.

24:49.864 --> 24:52.034
I, uh... I heard what happened.

24:52.117 --> 24:53.326
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.289
No, uh, actually, I'm...
I'm barely holding on.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.499
I really don't enjoy
being used for target practice.

25:00.708 --> 25:01.834
Come here.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.297
- I'm glad you're okay.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.840
Me, too.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.389
How about you?

25:15.765 --> 25:17.100
Uh, me, yeah, I'm fine.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.605
Hair of the dog that bit you?

25:29.946 --> 25:31.614
It's, uh, it's not what it looks like.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.493
What does it look like?

25:37.620 --> 25:39.789
Sorry.
No, I don't mean to pry.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.958
-I just, I worry about you a little bit...
-No need. No need.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.460
-...sometimes.
-Appreciate it.

25:44.461 --> 25:45.795
There's no need to worry.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.757
Yeah, you know that doesn't help, right?

25:49.841 --> 25:51.801
You denying that there's anything wrong.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.553
- Karen, let's not...
- No, I...

25:53.636 --> 25:55.388
How many times can I hear
that you fell down the stairs,

25:55.472 --> 25:58.183
-or you walked into a door?
-Well, you know, I'm blind.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.017
And you know that I'm not an idiot.

26:06.358 --> 26:07.609
Okay, um...

26:10.528 --> 26:11.613
Let's say this.

26:12.947 --> 26:15.158
When, or if, you ever feel like...

26:16.534 --> 26:18.870
you can tell me
what's really going on with you...

26:21.123 --> 26:22.540
I promise that I'm here.

26:25.335 --> 26:26.919
Is that a deal?

26:27.003 --> 26:28.171
That is a deal.

26:30.548 --> 26:31.591
- Good.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.553
Now, what can you tell me about
the meeting with the DA?

26:35.637 --> 26:39.141
Yeah, um, it's...
Where to begin? Um...

26:39.224 --> 26:41.976
-Reyes showed up.
-Personally?

26:42.059 --> 26:44.146
- Uh, yeah.
- Any idea why?

26:44.229 --> 26:47.565
Well, uh, it wasn't to bask us
in the warmth of her personality,

26:47.649 --> 26:48.650
I can tell you that.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.318
Yeah, Reyes wouldn't buy a pack of gum

26:50.402 --> 26:52.154
if it didn't move her
political career forward.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.448
Well, she wants him on a wire.

26:55.532 --> 26:58.743
She's got him set up for a meeting
with some big fish in the mob named Brass.

26:58.826 --> 26:59.911
And are they gonna protect Grotto?

26:59.994 --> 27:03.206
Yeah. But he's scared shitless
over this psycho shooter, Matt,

27:03.290 --> 27:04.832
and I can't say that I blame him.

27:06.251 --> 27:09.629
Reyes even used it for leverage.
She called him "the Punisher."

27:11.548 --> 27:14.884
-What do they know about him?
-That he's very scary,

27:14.967 --> 27:17.220
but I could have told you that.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.557
So whatever they know about him downtown,
they're keeping it to themselves.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.267
All right, well, that's where we start.

27:22.350 --> 27:25.061
We need to put together a file,
a thorough one.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.896
Find out who this guy is,
what makes him tick.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.022
-Great.
-Yeah.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.649
Mm-hmm.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.944
You think, uh...
you think he's crazy?

27:35.363 --> 27:36.989
Uh, the Punisher? No.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.783
I think he was inevitable.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.119
Inevitable? How so?

27:43.330 --> 27:46.123
Maybe... maybe we created him.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.960
All of us.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.962
The moment that we let Daredevil,

27:51.045 --> 27:52.797
or the Devil of Hell's Kitchen,
or whatever it is--

27:52.880 --> 27:55.007
There's... there's no connection.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.469
Well, actually, I think
it's a pretty straight line, Matt.

27:57.552 --> 28:00.388
Daredevil practiced vigilante justice
in our backyard

28:00.472 --> 28:02.098
and we applauded him for it.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.808
I know that I did.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.143
And we never stopped to think
that maybe...

28:06.228 --> 28:09.231
his actions could open the door
for men like this.

28:09.314 --> 28:12.859
Men... men with guns.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.278
Men who think that the law
belongs to them.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.532
There... there's a difference.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.909
-Well, I don't see it. Not anymore.
-Yeah, well...

28:21.993 --> 28:23.370
Daredevil never killed anyone.

28:23.453 --> 28:24.871
Well, not that we know of.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.000
There's something about this city

28:29.083 --> 28:32.962
that makes good people want to
shoot their way out of bad situations.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.758
You think this "Punisher"
could be a good person?

28:37.550 --> 28:38.593
No.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.513
No, I'm just saying...

28:43.348 --> 28:44.974
he could be any one of us.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.107
I'm gonna get back to Foggy.

28:54.859 --> 28:58.070
-You know he hates prepping cases alone.
-Right.

28:58.154 --> 29:00.282
-Uh, if you need anything at all...
-No, I won't.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.617
-...you just let us know, okay?
-Okay, thanks.

29:03.618 --> 29:05.870
Thank you for coming around.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.455
Wait, Matt, I, um...

29:11.543 --> 29:12.877
We care about you.

29:16.881 --> 29:19.216
You're worth keeping around.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.521
How far away was this guy when he hit you?

29:31.604 --> 29:34.023
Four or five feet. Why?

29:35.400 --> 29:36.734
He could've killed you.

29:37.735 --> 29:41.197
And one inch in either direction,
your face would be spaghetti.

29:41.281 --> 29:42.949
I mean, look at that shot placement.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.618
I got lucky.

29:45.702 --> 29:47.161
Yeah, maybe.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.871
Or maybe it was a warning shot.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.459
He could've finished you off, but didn't.

29:53.751 --> 29:55.503
Talk about getting your bell rung.

29:56.504 --> 29:58.506
Can you fix it or not?

30:06.263 --> 30:09.183
I promised Betsy I wouldn't
do anything illegal anymore.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.185
I'm not a criminal, Melvin.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.939
You don't have a badge, either.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.609
Look, the man who did this has
already killed dozens in Hell's Kitchen.

30:17.692 --> 30:20.945
How much longer before innocent people
start getting caught in his crossfire?

30:21.028 --> 30:22.989
Yeah?

30:23.072 --> 30:24.115
You sure he didn't follow you here?

30:24.198 --> 30:25.867
I would never allow that to happen.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.786
Okay, it's just you'd never allow yourself
to be shot in the head before.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.372
I gave you my word, Melvin.

30:30.455 --> 30:32.874
When I promised to protect
you and Betsy, remember?

30:35.585 --> 30:37.086
I remember.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.883
It's just I can't just fix this.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.259
Why not?

30:43.343 --> 30:45.762
You gotta understand, it's not just
the cracked part that's broken.

30:45.845 --> 30:49.223
The crack makes the whole thing fragile
like a bird egg.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.559
I gotta make you a new one.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.936
Okay, well, how long is that gonna take?

30:56.856 --> 30:58.400
I don't know, a couple days, maybe?

30:58.483 --> 30:59.567
If I don't sleep.

30:59.651 --> 31:01.318
What can you do for me tonight?

31:03.320 --> 31:07.324
I don't know. Reinforce the cracks.
Replace some of the padding.

31:08.410 --> 31:10.453
Yeah, good. Do it.

31:10.537 --> 31:13.289
Okay, but it won't keep you safe.

31:13.373 --> 31:14.707
I thought that's what you wanted me to do.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.669
We keep each other safe, don't we?
Isn't that our deal?

31:17.752 --> 31:20.046
Yeah, just do your best, Melvin. Okay?

31:27.011 --> 31:28.805
Are you sure you're ready to go out again?

31:32.224 --> 31:33.435
Do I look ready?

35:04.979 --> 35:06.063
Hey, boy.

35:09.066 --> 35:10.777
--Good boy.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.332
Good boy.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.534
Jimmy and the boys
are unloading the trailer.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.161
We're breaking this down for parts.

36:13.047 --> 36:14.048
Come on.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.243
Hey... No, no, no!

36:45.705 --> 36:47.123
Don't! Don't!

37:42.553 --> 37:44.555
Reyes. Are we in position? Over.

37:44.638 --> 37:47.474
Eyes on Brass. He's moving.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.185
He's moving northeast
to the warehouse.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.813
- How far out?
- Five minutes.

37:51.896 --> 37:53.564
Sending in Grote in five.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.238
This is the frigging wire
you want me to wear?

38:01.322 --> 38:02.990
Why don't I just carry
a video camera with me

38:03.074 --> 38:04.075
and a guy with a boom mic?

38:04.158 --> 38:05.952
Relax, Grotto, you'll be fine.

38:07.036 --> 38:11.582
Look, either you are
the luckiest man in Hell's Kitchen,

38:11.665 --> 38:14.043
or someone up there thinks
you're worth saving.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.963
- I really hope that's true.
- We're all set on our end.

38:17.713 --> 38:18.755
Well, good for you, lady.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.008
Me? I got some serious
reservations about this shit.

38:21.092 --> 38:22.551
Should I be concerned?

38:24.095 --> 38:26.973
All we need is for Brass to admit
he's dealing drugs again.

38:27.056 --> 38:30.142
Okay, he doesn't have to say where,
he doesn't have to say to who.

38:30.226 --> 38:31.560
Just get him to confirm it. All right?

38:31.643 --> 38:33.896
Don't make it the first question.
Don't even make it the second one.

38:33.980 --> 38:35.439
Get there organically.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.066
You'll be in and out before you know it.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.861
-He's got no reason not to trust you.
-No?

38:39.944 --> 38:41.070
Look at this thing.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.364
It's like an eight-track player
around my neck.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.699
You came to us for a deal, Grotto.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.994
You wanna walk, walk.
We can always find someone else.

38:48.077 --> 38:51.873
After recent events,
we've got plenty of exciting prospects.

38:51.956 --> 38:55.251
Lots of low-lives are looking to
get out of the crime business for good.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.544
-I don't doubt that.
-Good.

38:57.628 --> 38:59.171
You know where we stand then.

39:00.131 --> 39:03.384
Maybe you should do
some counseling, Counselor.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.427
Hopefully before I change my mind.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.099
This is not a deal you walk away from.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.433
Not alive, no.

39:11.517 --> 39:12.809
You get them Brass

39:12.894 --> 39:14.979
and they get you away
from the psychopath hunting you.

39:15.062 --> 39:16.105
It ain't just him.

39:16.188 --> 39:17.899
What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?

39:17.982 --> 39:19.400
What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?

39:19.483 --> 39:20.609
They didn't.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.736
When Fisk went away,
so did a lot of corrupt cops.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.821
No one's palms
are getting greased anymore.

39:24.906 --> 39:26.073
We're getting you out. Clean.

39:26.157 --> 39:27.199
Yeah.

39:27.283 --> 39:28.742
Doesn't feel like getting out.
Feels like getting in.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.411
Deeper than before.

39:30.494 --> 39:32.413
- No, you're not.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.123
Grotto, this is your second chance.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.208
Just don't say anything incriminating,
you'll be fine.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.377
-You serious? Is he serious?
-No.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.379
- Is that a concern?
- No, I'm kidding.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.256
You're covered.
That's why we're here.

39:42.339 --> 39:45.259
Just let the other guy
do all the talking...

39:46.260 --> 39:47.844
and you'll walk out of there alive.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.222
Fine.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.225
These are your orders
for witness protection.

39:53.309 --> 39:54.310
Golden ticket.

39:54.393 --> 39:57.188
It's, uh, legally binding until midnight.

39:57.271 --> 40:01.233
Upon which, if not executed, they turn
into the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.

40:01.317 --> 40:02.609
--What?

40:02.693 --> 40:05.279
-Nothing.
-Let's go. It's time.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.740
Bet these assholes are
sending me to Florida.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.742
Actually, they are.

40:12.203 --> 40:13.913
Did I tell you I hate Florida?

40:13.996 --> 40:15.539
Only about a thousand times.

40:21.378 --> 40:22.379
Thank you.

40:23.339 --> 40:24.423
You're welcome.

40:26.717 --> 40:28.344
Kiss for good luck, sweetheart?

40:35.059 --> 40:36.685
I'll take it.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.902
Uh, so did you hear anything from Matt?

40:45.987 --> 40:49.406
Um, he said he's feeling a little better.
Uh, something about turning in early.

40:49.490 --> 40:51.158
Oh, that's good.

40:51.242 --> 40:53.995
- Yeah. I'm sure he's fine.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.361
It's showtime.
Target's inside the perimeter.

41:27.444 --> 41:28.654
Target?

41:28.737 --> 41:31.991
Only an expression, Nelson.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

41:32.074 --> 41:33.159
Stay with him.

41:37.663 --> 41:38.789
What the hell is he doing?

41:38.872 --> 41:41.792
Uh, from the look of the thing,
I'd say he's trying not to crap his pants.

41:46.338 --> 41:47.506
Yo, Brass!

41:48.299 --> 41:49.300
It's me, Grotto.

41:49.383 --> 41:51.760
Cut the spook act
and say something already!

41:55.806 --> 41:57.183
Shit, shit.

41:58.767 --> 41:59.768
Shit.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.647
You don't wanna deal, fine!

42:04.898 --> 42:07.609
Find someone else
stupid enough to buy H off you!

42:12.989 --> 42:14.158
Good one, asshole.

42:16.327 --> 42:18.704
Let's get this done.

42:18.787 --> 42:20.331
I got places I gotta be tonight.

42:27.379 --> 42:28.422
We lost visual.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.595
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday,
what do you call it? Abort!

42:34.678 --> 42:36.513
-Abort!
-I'm a cop, moron. Shut up.

42:36.597 --> 42:38.349
And sound.
I can't hear him anymore.

42:38.432 --> 42:40.434
Probably just interference from
the metal in the shipping crate.

42:40.517 --> 42:43.229
Most likely, ma'am.
We'll, uh, try adjusting the gain on it.

42:46.732 --> 42:47.858
Package is delivered.

42:47.941 --> 42:50.611
-What do you mean "package is delivered"?
-If I was you, I'd put that on.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.488
-What? Why? Why?
-Charlie one is now set.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.030
- Over.
- Roger that, Charlie one.

42:54.115 --> 42:56.200
Overwatch positions,
check in by the numbers.

42:56.283 --> 42:58.119
What exactly is an "overwatch position"?

42:58.202 --> 42:59.578
Let the police do their job.

43:02.539 --> 43:03.582
Charlie three is set.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.626
Clear fields of fire
in sectors one and five. Over.

43:05.709 --> 43:07.169
Charlie four is set.
Clear fields of--

43:07.253 --> 43:09.796
"Fields of fire"
doesn't sound like cop talk to me.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.465
That sounds like you're
planning an ambush.

43:11.548 --> 43:14.385
Really? You're using my client
as bait for the Punisher?

43:14.468 --> 43:17.096
Probably the first useful thing
your client's ever done in his life.

43:17.179 --> 43:19.681
Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun suing you.

43:19.765 --> 43:22.434
Whatever it is that you have
planned here for tonight, it ends now.

43:22.518 --> 43:24.103
We're getting Grotto out.

43:24.186 --> 43:26.188
We have a situation taking place
on Tac channel one, ma'am!

43:26.272 --> 43:29.065
Target is inbound.
Repeat, target is inbound.

43:38.492 --> 43:39.826
Take him out!

43:54.216 --> 43:55.259
Hold your fire! Move in!

43:56.552 --> 43:58.970
-Keep your bead!
-I'll go left!

43:59.054 --> 44:00.472
Hands in the air! Now!

44:02.766 --> 44:05.852
Shit! It's not him, it's a diversion.
Target's still out there!

44:09.940 --> 44:11.608
The bastard knew it was a trap.

44:45.934 --> 44:46.935
Shit.

45:23.514 --> 45:25.391
Grotto's getting away.
We have to go get him.

45:25.474 --> 45:26.517
No, you can't go out there.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.059
-Foggy!
-This place is about to become a war zone.

45:28.143 --> 45:29.645
-I don't care.
-I know it sucks,

45:29.728 --> 45:31.605
but the safest place to be
is in this room right now.

45:31.688 --> 45:33.690
--What the hell is that?

45:33.774 --> 45:36.151
Status report.
What's going on out there?

45:36.234 --> 45:37.694
Target acquired.

45:37.778 --> 45:39.112
-You know what to do.
-Negative.

45:39.195 --> 45:41.239
We do not, I repeat,
we do not have a clean target.

45:41.323 --> 45:42.324
Shit!

45:42.408 --> 45:45.035
You know what to do.
Take the shot!

45:45.118 --> 45:47.078
- No.
- Ten-four.

45:47.162 --> 45:49.498
Take the shot.
Repeat, take the shot!

46:39.631 --> 46:41.467
- We lost him!

46:42.258 --> 46:43.259
Foggy?

48:08.470 --> 48:09.513
Ground floor clear.

48:11.056 --> 48:13.058
They're gone. Repeat, they're gone.
