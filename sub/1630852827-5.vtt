00:19.160 --> 00:20.360
Isabel!

01:01.360 --> 01:02.640
Can I help you?

01:09.760 --> 01:10.760
You...

01:11.920 --> 01:13.000
You raped my mother.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.080
You're a monster.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.080
I don't know who you are.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.080
But you seem
to have it in for me.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.080
Come on in.

02:41.960 --> 02:42.960
Take a seat.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.720
No.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.040
It's very brave
of you to come here.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.000
-I'm not scared of you.
-You have no reason to be.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.720
How could you do that to my mom?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.400
All those girls...

03:07.600 --> 03:09.200
-You're a monster.
-Yes.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.120
You said that already.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.480
All I can say is...

03:19.760 --> 03:20.760
I was ill.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.960
And not a day goes by,
not a single day,

03:26.840 --> 03:28.520
that I don't regret what I did.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.200
My mom...
My mom's name is Isabel.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.040
I bet you don't even remember.
She was just one more to you.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.080
Isabel?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.040
No.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.160
Thank you for coming.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.200
I was never able
to apologize for what I did.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.720
That was all
I thought about in jail.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.040
Saying sorry.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.360
There's...
something you don't know.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.080
What's that?

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
No, nothing.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.120
I have to go.

05:11.120 --> 05:11.160
I have to go.
-I need to get home.
-Hold on.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.400
-I need to get home.
-Hold on.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.240
Let me get you a glass of water
before you go.

05:18.720 --> 05:19.920
You look thirsty.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
No, I'm fine.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.560
Can't I even get you some water?

05:35.800 --> 05:37.080
Well, I am a bit thirsty.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.280
Don't go anywhere.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.480
Do you want mouth-to-mouth?

07:06.200 --> 07:09.080
I don't know how you can
joke around after this.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.160
I thought I was going to die.
That my time would end...

07:14.680 --> 07:16.440
at the bottom of the lake...

07:17.400 --> 07:19.520
That I'd be food for the salmon.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.040
There are no salmon here.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.760
It's a manner of speaking.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.560
And how exactly
did you end up in there?

07:31.720 --> 07:34.880
For someone who didn't want
to drown, you had a good go.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.000
What exactly are you implying?

07:37.920 --> 07:39.240
That I did it on purpose?

07:40.520 --> 07:41.680
You'd have reason to.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.920
I didn't.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.800
I don't know what happened.
I was dizzy.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.080
I was seeing double.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.120
And I drove off the road.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.560
Okay, then.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.040
Well, now you have no choice

08:06.840 --> 08:08.640
but to let me give you
a ride home.

08:08.840 --> 08:09.920
No.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.000
-Are you going to hitchhike?
-No.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.880
My daughter
can't see me like this.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.040
If she does,
I'll lose any standing I have

08:19.040 --> 08:19.080
If she does,
I'll lose any standing I have
and that's not much.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.200
and that's not much.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
So?

08:56.440 --> 08:57.480
Sorry for the wait.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.160
I thought you might like a soda.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.040
There we none in the fridge,
so...

09:03.560 --> 09:04.920
Well, it's a big house.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.000
You shouldn't have bothered,
water would've been fine.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
It's cold.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.440
You're my father.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.040
What was that?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.760
Impossible. How old are you?

09:34.520 --> 09:35.560
Sixteen.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.120
You raped her 16 years ago.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.760
You look younger.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.080
I never thought my dad
would be someone like you.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.680
You should go.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.080
This isn't what...

10:00.000 --> 10:01.320
Thanks for telling me.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.920
I imagine your mom, Isabel...
that's her name, right?

10:07.680 --> 10:10.360
-She doesn't know you're here.
-No.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.400
She said my dad was
someone else,

10:13.560 --> 10:15.160
I found out on my own.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.160
Go home.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.640
Too many emotions today
for such a young girl.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.000
Juan. Heroin addict.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.240
He held up a bank
where Pedro's son worked

10:35.360 --> 10:36.480
as a security guard,

10:37.160 --> 10:39.040
and shot him three times.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.280
What do these two people
have in common?

10:44.040 --> 10:46.200
When one person
assaults another,

10:46.840 --> 10:49.440
they become
emotionally connected.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.120
The more serious the assault,

10:51.840 --> 10:53.840
the more intense the connection.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.400
The more hate or vengeance,

10:56.560 --> 10:58.560
the stronger the tie
that binds them.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.360
There is only one way to break
this emotional bond

11:02.520 --> 11:04.200
between victim and perpetrator.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.760
Remorse,

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
apology,

11:10.760 --> 11:11.840
and amends.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.320
Thank you very much.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.200
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.400
What if there's no remorse?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.320
I mean...

11:30.080 --> 11:33.040
What if the person
who commits the crime

11:33.160 --> 11:35.080
shows no sign of remorse?

11:35.080 --> 11:35.120
shows no sign of remorse?
Then there's very little
we professionals can do.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.640
Then there's very little
we professionals can do.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.000
Sorry, please,
just one more question.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.440
As an expert psychiatrist,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.080
are parents responsible
for the actions of our children?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.160
Well,
that's a very broad question.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.040
Why do you ask?
Is it for a study?

11:52.040 --> 11:52.080
Why do you ask?
Is it for a study?
No, I'm not a professional.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.720
No, I'm not a professional.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.680
It's just a doubt I've had
for a very long time.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.280
There's no easy answer.
Genetics are significant,

11:59.400 --> 12:01.000
but so is our childhood...

12:01.000 --> 12:01.080
but so is our childhood...
Please, I just need
a yes or no answer.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.360
Please, I just need
a yes or no answer.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.440
Are we parents guilty for acts
committed by our children?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.080
Is this your house?

12:22.240 --> 12:25.000
My mom brought me here
to get over what happened.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.840
I haven't been back since.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.120
It's not exactly the best,
I don't know whose it is.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.720
-But it's clean.
-Alright.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.640
-It'll do.
-And towels. Here.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.560
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.040
Sit, if you like...

12:58.560 --> 13:01.160
Or don't. Just do whatever...

13:01.160 --> 13:02.320
I'm going to change.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.480
It looks alright.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.600
The good news...

13:33.520 --> 13:36.600
is that I can still fit into
the clothes I had when I was 16.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.080
Right, I'll whip us up a soup.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.080
What?

13:47.120 --> 13:49.640
There's no food here.
You won't find anything.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.400
-There must be something.
-Okay.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
What?

14:01.520 --> 14:04.560
I totally trust canned food.
It's my main food group.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.800
It must be expired.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.560
2025.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.640
It doesn't take much
to make me happy.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.320
Just wait
till we find a can opener.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.000
We have a little girl.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.160
-There's no coffee.
-I know.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.000
Were you expecting apple pie
for dessert?

15:06.480 --> 15:09.040
You know canned food
can give you stomach problems?

15:09.040 --> 15:09.080
You know canned food
can give you stomach problems?
I live alone. Having someone
to cook for would be nice.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.680
I live alone. Having someone
to cook for would be nice.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.120
A bad stomach is about all
I don't have.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.640
Weird things
keep happening to me.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.800
I can't explain it but...

15:25.400 --> 15:26.480
it's weird.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.200
I did make the DoI presentation.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.920
I did.
Then suddenly it was gone.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.920
-Maybe it didn't save properly.
-No.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.480
I saved it, it wasn't deleted.
It was there.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.360
Suddenly nothing's
where it's meant to be.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.360
I take a couple of Valerian
and drive off the road.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.880
Ockham's razor.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.080
Nieto...

15:49.080 --> 15:49.120
Nieto...
The simplest solution
is the most likely.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.880
The simplest solution
is the most likely.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.280
You're under too much pressure.
You're spiraling.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.080
It's a miracle I got you
out of that lake alive.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.320
You have to quit the case.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.320
No.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.120
Let's go, it's getting late.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.080
Various ex-cons are protesting
to demand protection

17:30.080 --> 17:30.120
Various ex-cons are protesting
to demand protection
in light of the crimes
against former cell-mates.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.440
in light of the crimes
against former cell-mates.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.840
Piece of shit!

17:36.000 --> 17:37.200
You can't protect us!

17:39.160 --> 17:41.360
-Out of the damn car!
-We want protection!

17:42.120 --> 17:45.080
I'm losing it,
I want this to be over already.

17:45.080 --> 17:45.160
I'm losing it,
I want this to be over already.
That isn't up to you.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.760
That isn't up to you.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.040
Don't worry
about things you can't control.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.880
Don't you get it?

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
Do you know what fear is?
I'm scared.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.840
Nobody knows you're here.
The room is in my name.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.160
How would they find you?
Have some faith!

17:59.600 --> 18:01.120
-You have to sleep.
-Sleep?

18:01.120 --> 18:01.160
-You have to sleep.
-Sleep?
-Yes.
-Sleep.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.560
-Yes.
-Sleep.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.920
That's enough. Roberto, stop!

18:06.080 --> 18:08.200
-Please, stop. Calm down!
-What?

18:08.360 --> 18:10.600
-What?
-Relax. Calm down.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Relax, please.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.240
That's it.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.680
Lie down.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.160
Lie on the bed.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.160
Come on, lie down.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.480
Don't worry.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.000
This will help you sleep.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.760
Not this one.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.920
Look, the happy couple.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.800
The floor was covered in brains.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.840
I didn't know all that
could fit inside a skull.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.600
I replayed it in my head
all night.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.000
I never know how long to wait.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.000
Take it out,
I've been keeping track.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.480
What do I do with this?

20:00.720 --> 20:01.800
I'll throw it out.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.080
Thank you, honey.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.960
So, what we know so far
is that you went

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
to take out the trash

20:13.560 --> 20:15.960
and witnessed the murder.
Is that right?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.440
The garbage truck
hadn't passed yet,

20:19.600 --> 20:20.760
that's for sure,

20:20.880 --> 20:22.640
because I see it
from my balcony.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.120
They always leave the bins
scattered all over the place.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.800
I know they're in a rush but...

20:28.920 --> 20:32.600
Yes. The time doesn't matter.
I mean, it's not important.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.120
I need any details that may
help me identify the assailant.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.520
The assailant is
the killer, right?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.280
Yes, that's right.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.520
He was wearing a monkey mask.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.600
Yes, we know that.

20:50.800 --> 20:55.160
Anything else? Like...
His clothes, his neck, hands...

20:57.280 --> 20:58.680
His back.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.400
His back.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.240
You wish, buddy.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.120
Look, a bad guy.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.360
Move over, gorgeous.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.680
Any traces of DNA?

22:02.840 --> 22:04.840
-Plenty of traces.
-Let's see the report.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Don't waste your time
on the forensics.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.160
-Why's that?
-Be specific.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.880
Impossible. It's full of crap
from all across town.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.760
We'll keep it as a memento.
I'll go file it.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.480
I'm going to take a look.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.240
Hi.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.120
-Sorry to bother you.
-Hello, again.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.120
I saw you sitting here... May I?

22:38.080 --> 22:39.600
-Sure, go ahead.
-Thanks.

22:43.320 --> 22:47.720
Truth is, I've so many questions
I don't know where to start.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.560
Tell me your story.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.800
Just as you tell it
to yourself in your mind.

22:54.960 --> 22:55.960
Right.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.360
Look, I...
became a father by surprise.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.040
I was here on business,
opening an office

23:03.160 --> 23:05.320
for an important company
from my hometown.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.320
The mother wasn't even
my girlfriend but...

23:08.800 --> 23:09.840
she got pregnant.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.920
We got on well.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.160
Sorry.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.880
-Do you mind?
-No.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.400
Thanks.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.800
So... the kid wasn't planned,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.240
but he was very loved,
always, from the start.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.080
We were so excited.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.280
And the early years
were the best of our lives.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.960
But...

23:36.120 --> 23:37.640
as he grew,

23:37.800 --> 23:39.680
we knew something wasn't right.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.080
He had no empathy,

23:42.080 --> 23:42.120
He had no empathy,
he was manipulative
with his mother, with me...

23:42.120 --> 23:44.960
he was manipulative
with his mother, with me...

23:45.120 --> 23:48.720
He was cruel to everyone,
his friends, the help...

23:52.600 --> 23:55.480
Later, as time passed,
he did awful things.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.200
He caused so much pain.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.600
My wife couldn't handle
the stress, she fell ill.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.320
She died thinking
it was her fault,

24:06.440 --> 24:08.160
that she'd been a bad mother.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.640
Where did we go wrong?

24:11.520 --> 24:14.000
Why couldn't we fix him?

24:15.160 --> 24:18.360
In these cases,
parents are the first victims.

24:19.720 --> 24:20.720
But...

24:21.640 --> 24:26.000
diagnosing something so complex
requires an in-depth assessment.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.160
Tell me.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.920
What are
these awful things he did?

24:34.720 --> 24:35.760
I need specifics.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.840
You haven't even told me
your name.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.120
No.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.960
No. I'd rather not reveal that.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.640
I'm a psychiatrist.
There's patient confidentiality.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.440
Sure, but I'd rather not.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.080
Very well. I'm sorry.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.280
But I have to go.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.680
You... you can score down there.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.520
I have a proposition for you.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.200
I'm no gigolo.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.040
No, it's nothing like that.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.800
Get in.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.040
I told you to get in.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.960
Six thousand nine-hundred.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.360
Right.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.760
-Your car is still in the lake.
-And my ID card.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.040
Driver's license,
my credit cards...

26:15.600 --> 26:17.880
I was too busy fighting
for my life

26:18.040 --> 26:19.680
to remember to grab my purse.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.640
Someone has just graffitied
your car.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.880
-What?
-Right across the front.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.400
In luminous spray,
it reads "protection".

26:27.560 --> 26:29.120
-Did you see who it was?
-No.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.120
I wish.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.120
This is some steak,
it's bigger than the plate.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.280
I haven't eaten meat in...

26:42.680 --> 26:45.240
I believe it's the only food
a man should consume.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.440
It's noble, honest.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.680
Tendons, muscles... blood.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.720
That's one way of looking at it.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.880
I'd forgotten the flavor.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.440
Last week, I bought
a pack of mortadella.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.040
I was jumping for joy.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.120
Four slices of pure bliss.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.680
I had two in the morning,
another two at night...

27:08.880 --> 27:11.520
There is always bread
in the trash in Spain.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.800
What's up?
Do I have food on my face?

27:21.400 --> 27:23.000
You have strong features.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.880
I'd never noticed.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.200
Looking in the mirror
when you live like this,

27:30.360 --> 27:32.200
well... it's best avoided.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.960
I prefer to remember
how I used to be.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.080
Family?

27:40.520 --> 27:42.240
-I had.
-It's for the best.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.520
Family is a burden.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.120
I had a wife.

27:46.800 --> 27:47.800
And dreams.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.400
I came here
to set up a business.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.520
All my savings into one idea.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.840
My wife said...

27:56.040 --> 27:59.640
it'd never take off
and then the crisis hit in 2008.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.640
She took off immediately
with another guy.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.040
I don't blame her.

28:06.040 --> 28:06.120
I don't blame her.
I think she's living in a
detached house in Alpedrete.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.040
I think she's living in a
detached house in Alpedrete.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.200
So, you're on your own.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.240
Completely.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.200
I could die tomorrow
and nobody would miss me.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.480
Believe it or not,
that's a good thing.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.680
Can I ask you a question?

28:21.320 --> 28:22.960
What does one feel...

28:23.920 --> 28:26.160
when they're this rich?
Like, crazy rich.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.360
Power.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.160
Do you want dessert?

28:34.640 --> 28:36.320
If it's not asking too much...

28:37.200 --> 28:38.960
I'll have room, that's for sure.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.400
So...
What do you have planned for me?

28:43.440 --> 28:45.600
Any job you need done,
I'm your man.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
Glad to hear it.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.000
They key is adding
to your resume,

28:51.160 --> 28:52.920
so you can start over.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.160
You can always start over.

28:57.680 --> 28:58.680
Right?

29:06.880 --> 29:08.080
Yes?

29:13.160 --> 29:15.720
Okay. I'm on my way.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.040
-You okay?
-It was my kid's school.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.480
I'll be right back.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.480
-Hello.
-Hi. Thanks for coming.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.000
-Thanks for calling.
-I'll leave you so you can talk.

29:33.000 --> 29:33.040
-Thanks for calling.
-I'll leave you so you can talk.
Great.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.000
Great.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.480
What happened?

29:59.160 --> 30:00.160
Isn't it obvious?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.480
No, it's not.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.760
Why did you do it?
This isn't you.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.800
My job is to interrogate,
so you'd better start talking

30:16.960 --> 30:18.080
and get this over with.

30:19.840 --> 30:20.840
Sol.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.560
They were talking about you.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.320
You got in a fight over me?

30:34.880 --> 30:35.880
I'm sorry.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.760
I'm sorry you're having...

30:41.120 --> 30:43.440
to go through all this
because of me, really.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.080
I want to go live
with Grandma for a while.

30:52.840 --> 30:53.840
What?

30:55.160 --> 30:57.120
-I'm going to live with Grandma.
-No.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.720
Look, Sol, I know I haven't...

31:03.760 --> 31:05.000
been the best mom.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.560
I made mistakes,
I wasn't what you deserve...

31:10.040 --> 31:11.440
Maybe I haven't been the mom

31:12.600 --> 31:14.480
you would have wanted, but I...

31:19.960 --> 31:21.520
We've always been together.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.200
You're the best thing
in my life.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.520
Sol, look at me.

31:31.800 --> 31:32.800
Please.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.160
-I want to live with Grandma.
-Okay.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.280
This is like Paradise.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.080
If this were mine,
I'd never leave.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.520
I'm glad to hear it.

31:53.320 --> 31:56.040
-You'll be here a lot.
-As long as you need.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.400
So... about the contract,
what were you thinking?

32:00.400 --> 32:02.320
I'd like it all
to be above board,

32:02.440 --> 32:05.080
I need to start paying
my social security.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.880
But if you weren't thinking
along those lines...

32:08.000 --> 32:09.160
Whoa!

32:09.360 --> 32:11.120
A tennis court.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.400
If you like, I can help you
clean it up a bit.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.920
That won't be necessary.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.920
So, what will be
my job here exactly?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.080
-We're nearly there.
-Excuse my eagerness.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.360
When you live outside
of the general population

32:25.520 --> 32:28.640
-and have a chance to...
-Society is harsh...

32:29.480 --> 32:31.120
You don't know
how thankful I am.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.120
Down-to-earth people like you
just don't exist anymore.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.840
You live in a mansion, I live
in a windowless cardboard box,

32:39.440 --> 32:40.480
and even so...

32:43.200 --> 32:45.400
Turn around,
you'll see a lemon tree.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.280
A lemon tree? No. Where...?

33:23.080 --> 33:24.160
Isabel.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.200
-Am I alright?
-Yes.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.480
Isabel, excuse me.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.120
A quick question, Isabel.
Just one.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.360
You must have something to say.

33:39.640 --> 33:42.080
-Just give us something.
-No, don't close it.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.080
Just a moment.
Hang on, just one question.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.040
I do want to say something.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.640
About the lack of integrity

34:00.400 --> 34:02.080
and shameless actions

34:02.080 --> 34:02.120
and shameless actions
of certain so-called
journalistic professionals,

34:02.120 --> 34:05.640
of certain so-called
journalistic professionals,

34:05.800 --> 34:08.080
who couldn't care less
about the consequences

34:08.200 --> 34:10.280
or suffering caused
by their actions.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.240
And claiming as justification,

34:13.080 --> 34:15.960
the right to information,

34:16.120 --> 34:19.160
they're capable of stooping
to the lowest of the low,

34:19.280 --> 34:22.040
-because they're vultures.
-Is this aimed at me?

34:22.040 --> 34:22.120
-because they're vultures.
-Is this aimed at me?
What kind of journalism
rips families apart?

34:22.120 --> 34:25.160
What kind of journalism
rips families apart?

34:25.760 --> 34:27.200
Destroys people.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.440
So, you don't believe
in freedom of the press?

34:29.560 --> 34:32.320
-No.
-Do you want censoring?

34:32.520 --> 34:35.000
-No.
-Who decides what's relevant?

34:35.160 --> 34:38.040
This is from a representative
of the Police Force.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.040
PROTECTION

34:45.040 --> 34:48.000
What's going on there?
What the hell is Isabel doing?

34:48.120 --> 34:49.120
Wait here.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.960
If you let me speak,
all I'm asking for is respect

34:55.120 --> 34:56.240
and a right to privacy.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.640
We're talking
about a murderer.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.320
Shouldn't privacy come second
when people are dying?

35:02.520 --> 35:03.960
I'd remind you
the Constitution...

35:04.080 --> 35:06.120
What's the Constitution
got to do with the fact

35:06.280 --> 35:09.280
that you reported
I'd been raped as a minor?

35:09.480 --> 35:10.640
What does it...

35:11.000 --> 35:13.160
Why didn't you tell me
about your daughter?

35:14.160 --> 35:16.400
Because you were the patient,
not me.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.000
-What's it got to do with that?
-Thank you.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.080
That's enough for today, thanks.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.440
If we find anything,
you'll be the first to know.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.480
That's the worst thing
you could do.

35:29.920 --> 35:30.920
Nailed it.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.160
What a moment.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.000
-Where are you going?
-To demand protection.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.360
It's my duty, don't you think?

35:45.520 --> 35:46.520
No.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.560
I don't have to do
everything you ask.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.960
Someone who is unstable
needs a guide.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.200
Is that right?

35:53.360 --> 35:56.920
You think I'm just some loser
who's worthless on his own.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.360
No, it's not that.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.760
I don't want you to get hurt.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
But I will.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.560
Do what I tell you
and you'll be fine.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.600
Help me!

36:48.080 --> 36:50.560
Can anyone hear me?
Get me out of here, please!

37:05.040 --> 37:07.120
Your life will finally
have meaning.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.800
-Let me help.
-I've got it.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.560
I'll go get the rest.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.080
Don't worry,
it's only temporary.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.320
She's taking
her snorkeling gear.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.760
She won't even look at me.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.600
And you won't look at me...

37:34.800 --> 37:36.600
It's a good thing
there are only three of us.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.120
It must be hereditary.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.080
Everyone needs a breather,
and space sometime.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.240
I'm the only one who
wants to see you both.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.680
I could say no, I'm her mom.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.000
I can tell you from experience
that doesn't work.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.360
I want to know
her comings and goings,

37:54.520 --> 37:57.920
-what she eats and doesn't.
-What about you?

37:59.080 --> 38:01.920
-Who updates me on you?
-I can look after myself.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.160
You be careful. Your friend
lives in a rough area.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.720
-What friend?
-The one from the hostel.

38:10.360 --> 38:14.080
-Don't worry about me.
-What if you get robbed or hurt.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.000
You can leave the fish.
I think I can keep him alive.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.040
I doubt it, Mom.
You always forget to feed him.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
In you get.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.120
-Bye.
-Bye.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.440
Shame, they're leaving
you alone, Isabel.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.040
What a circus.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.640
They're in there
on hunger strike.

39:22.040 --> 39:25.160
And they won't come out
until you find the killer.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.560
Or until nature takes
its course.

39:29.680 --> 39:32.440
I don't want another two deaths
on my conscience.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.360
JUSTICE
WE WANT PROTECTION

39:40.520 --> 39:42.560
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.800
-This will do for a while.
-Yeah.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.800
Hey, how long can a person
last without food?

39:50.240 --> 39:52.000
Some, up to 73 days.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.920
I need a new wardrobe.
Something less perky.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.320
This report is so important,
Javi.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.040
-You get it, right?
-Then, are we with

40:02.200 --> 40:05.480
-these guys or the others.
-With whoever we need.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.840
Alright, I'm going home.
Call me with anything.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.120
Whatever time it is.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.800
You coming for dinner?

40:18.480 --> 40:19.800
Me, you and your wife?

40:20.640 --> 40:22.040
Threesomes aren't my thing.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.520
I thought you were modern.

40:30.400 --> 40:35.040
Javi, call my husband,
tell him I got caught up here.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.040
Right.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.080
Alright, rest up.

40:56.880 --> 40:57.880
I'm all done.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.840
Shall we head to your place
and unwind?

41:02.600 --> 41:03.640
I don't think so.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.440
Right.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.440
Okay, then.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.440
Next time you call,
I might be busy.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.520
I'll take the risk.

41:17.720 --> 41:18.720
Goodnight.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.240
Sol.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.240
That's the reaction you want
when visiting someone.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.840
-I thought you were my daughter.
-What, is she out past curfew?

42:05.040 --> 42:07.000
No. She's gone to
live with my mother.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.840
So, what is it?

42:17.120 --> 42:19.240
I've arranged
for your car to be rescued.

42:21.680 --> 42:22.920
You didn't have to.

42:24.680 --> 42:25.760
I didn't have to.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.480
-But I did.
-Thanks.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.240
Didn't they think it was odd,

42:31.360 --> 42:33.080
a police officer's car
in a lake?

42:33.080 --> 42:33.120
a police officer's car
in a lake?
-They didn't ask?
-It's all settled.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.760
-They didn't ask?
-It's all settled.

42:34.920 --> 42:35.920
Okay.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.120
Right. That was all.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.800
Bye.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.360
Want some soup?

42:44.560 --> 42:45.560
-Soup?
-Yes.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.880
I was going to open a can and...

42:49.000 --> 42:51.120
I don't want
to throw out the rest.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.040
Well... that seems like

42:54.240 --> 42:56.920
-a good enough reason.
-Let me open it.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.720
They're the same.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.960
Minestrone, I don't know if
it's any good, it might be crap.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.160
I hope you won't shoot me
this time.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.080
No.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.120
You can't be happy.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.000
You can't be happy.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.160
You can't be happy!
