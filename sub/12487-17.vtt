that you're looking at this
all wrong.

19:31.169 --> 19:34.339
- You said before that you were
the reason we lost last game.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.257
Look at the footage.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.050
We all lost the last game.

19:37.134 --> 19:40.012
Just like we all lost the game
before that.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.055
- I guess that makes sense.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.891
- I mean, we were so excited
about the playoffs we didn't

19:43.974 --> 19:46.435
think about how much pressure
we were putting on you.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.603
- Yeah, you're pretty awesome,

19:47.686 --> 19:50.272
but no one of us ever wins
or loses a game.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.858
- We win as a team
and we lose as a team.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.322
- My--my hand's not shaking.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.033
I'm thinking of football
and my hand's not shaking!

20:01.116 --> 20:01.658
My yips are gone.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.244
Thanks, guys.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.330
- You ready to book our
ticket to the playoffs?

20:06.413 --> 20:10.500
- Hey, we win as a team,
lose as a team.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.419
- ALL: Win as a team,
lose as a team.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.546
Win as a team, lose as a team.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.214
Win as a team, lose as a team.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.300
Win as a team, lose as a team.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.637
- Pro white buck
dogs special on three. Ready?

20:21.720 --> 20:22.721
- ALL: Break!

20:22.804 --> 20:23.764
- This is it, folks.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.015
Only seconds left,

20:25.098 --> 20:26.183
and the Bulldogs are down
by five points.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.561
We have to win
to make it to the playoffs!

20:29.645 --> 20:30.812
- MAN: One, two, three, four.
