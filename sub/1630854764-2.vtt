Honey, um...

00:19.061 --> 00:21.063
There's something
you should know about your mom.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.482
I'm a dirty liar.

00:23.482 --> 00:24.733
SOPHIE'S SON [on phone]:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:27.736
<i>Is this endless story
you're telling not even true?</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:29.863
Of course, it is!

00:29.863 --> 00:32.741
I quit lying last year when I turned 40.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.035
SOPHIE'S SON: <i>Mom--</i>
- Don't.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.246
But back in the day,
compulsive lying,

00:37.246 --> 00:39.456
well, it was kind of my jam.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.959
Especially when I was feeling insecure.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.337
And waiting to hear from the gallery
if my photos sold

00:45.337 --> 00:47.631
was making me hella insecure.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.466
You know you can actually
get a ticket for that.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.843
It's called "distracted walking."

00:50.843 --> 00:53.637
Oh, I forgot you minored
in sidewalk law.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.556
Plus, I am not even distracted.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.393
That yoga class really centered me.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.979
Oh, excuse me.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.064
Pardon me. Sorry. Important call.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.941
Life-changing moment! Sorry!

01:06.692 --> 01:08.694
Hello? Uh-huh.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.947
Really? That's amazing.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.533
Thank you so much for the phone call.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.369
Turns out, that wasn't my phone.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.957
But, uh, Brooke, your dog's operation
was a success.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.211
Wait, is that--

01:26.211 --> 01:27.713
Meredith!

01:27.713 --> 01:30.382
This is not how I wanted to meet her.
I look gross!

01:30.382 --> 01:33.385
She's a pop star
whose single is breaking out,

01:33.385 --> 01:36.597
and I'm a struggling photographer
whose face is breaking out. Look at this!

01:38.432 --> 01:40.267
That was a piece of nougat.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.020
Yeah, so it's all been
kind of a whirlwind.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.438
I did the <i>Today</i> show yesterday,

01:44.438 --> 01:47.649
I'm doing <i>The Tonight Show</i> tomorrow,
and <i>Last Week Tonight</i> next week.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.484
Plus, she's got
<i>The Late Late Show</i> on Friday,

01:49.484 --> 01:52.237
and then that segment for <i>Sunday Morning</i>
later that afternoon.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.323
You're a <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
Thursday pre-shoot away

01:54.323 --> 01:56.116
from having the world's
most confusing schedule.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.367
Ugh, come on!

01:57.367 --> 01:59.411
You know, it's been days
since I gave Rachel my number,

01:59.411 --> 02:02.164
and she still has it texted me yet!
But, she has time to tweet

02:02.164 --> 02:05.250
that Sarah Paulson was
a revelation as Roseanne Barr?

02:05.250 --> 02:06.627
That was Sarah Paulson in

02:06.627 --> 02:08.879
<i>Lower the Barr: the Life
and Unhinging of Roseanne Barr?</i>

02:09.713 --> 02:11.215
What a chameleon!

02:12.674 --> 02:16.261
Oh. Sid, my beer is all foam.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.389
- It's called <i>head</i>, not <i>foam</i>.
- Oh.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.433
Well then, why'd you
give me so much head?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.560
- Oh!
- Head!

02:23.560 --> 02:25.729
Clean it up, Meredith.
This is a family bar.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.565
No worries. I'll take it.
Old J-Boy loves head.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.984
Ah, love it when you
push the envelope, bro!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.194
What...

02:32.194 --> 02:34.905
Oh hey, what is Sophie doing outside?

02:35.531 --> 02:38.200
Babe, you gotta blend.
You look like the clown from <i>It.</i>

02:38.200 --> 02:39.576
- From what?
- From <i>It.</i>

02:39.576 --> 02:40.953
- From <i>what?</i>
- From <i>It!</i>

02:40.953 --> 02:42.287
<i>It</i> is the name of the movie.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.830
What is the name of the movie?!

02:43.830 --> 02:46.291
You know everyone can see you, right?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.713
You wanna stop being weird
and come inside?

02:51.713 --> 02:53.841
I don't know. It's gonna be so awkward.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.969
Jesse probably told her about our thing.
I'm sure she's threatened by it.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.096
- Nope. She doesn't care.
- Damn it.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.973
God, that makes it so much worse.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.975
Of course, Meredith
isn't threatened by me.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.726
She just released Song of the Year,
and I...

03:04.726 --> 03:07.145
I just sold a photo
for a crazy amount of money.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.814
Wow. Good for you!

03:08.814 --> 03:11.441
- Did she sell it?
- No! She's going full Elizabeth Holmes.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.903
Yeah, it was a huge bidding war
between the Prince of Liechtenstein,

03:14.903 --> 03:16.405
the CFO of Barry's Bootcamp,

03:16.405 --> 03:19.032
and the sisters from <i>Sister Sister</i>.
And just to be clear,

03:19.032 --> 03:22.035
the <i>Sister Sister</i> sisters were not
bidding together as sisters, so...

03:23.537 --> 03:24.997
Like I said,

03:24.997 --> 03:27.374
I had a <i>small</i> lying problem.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.960
SOPHIE'S SON: <i>Mom...</i>
- A medium lying problem.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.253
SOPHIE'S SON: <i>Mom!</i>
- Okay, fine.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.881
It was a huge [bleep] problem, okay?

03:36.925 --> 03:40.804
Ellen, watching Rachel's door
isn't gonna make her ask you out.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.433
Just like more water isn't gonna
bring back Planthony Hopkins.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.476
Do you think she changed
her mind about me?

03:46.852 --> 03:49.396
Of course, she did. Am I ugly?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.231
Charlie, you'd tell me
if I was ugly, right?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.109
Of course. I always tell ugly people
when they're ugly.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.112
Why do you think the fuggo super
won't fix our sink?

03:57.112 --> 03:59.114
You're right. I'm a dime.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.910
It must be my garbage personality.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.120
Ellen, if your personality is garbage,

04:05.120 --> 04:06.663
then call me a raccoon

04:06.663 --> 04:08.457
because I love it.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.293
Aw.
Well, then call me an ambulance

04:11.293 --> 04:14.004
because that compliment
damn near killed me.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.882
You just need to remind Rachel
how great you are.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.885
So, we are gonna spruce this place up,

04:19.885 --> 04:21.595
gonna put on our Sunday best,

04:21.595 --> 04:24.473
and then leave the door playfully ajar.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.518
When Rachel walks by, she won't be able
to resist asking you out.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.940
The only flaw in your plan is

04:32.940 --> 04:34.483
it's so bad in here.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.319
Yes. Should've had that threesome

04:37.319 --> 04:39.738
with Chip and Joanna Gaines
while I had the chance.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.116
Grilled cheese, coming in hot!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.702
Yes! This man is
a grilled cheese maestro.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.205
He's like the Eddie Vedder of cheddar.
May I?

04:48.205 --> 04:50.207
Dude, you never have
to ask about sharing stuff.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.584
Ooh...
- Food, shampoo, a journal...

04:52.584 --> 04:54.920
Okay, we've discussed this.
I'm not sharing a journal with you.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.422
I'm still gonna leave every other page
blank in case you change your mind.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.008
- I'm gonna go get some ranch.
- Yeah, ranch it up, baby!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.426
Mm, yum.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.846
Hey, hey, hey! Don't even think
about eating one of these.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.681
These are for me and Jesse.
- Seriously?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.432
There's, like, six of them.
- Yeah. Yeah!

05:07.432 --> 05:10.018
Two for me. Four for him. Zero for you.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.103
He's a hungry boy.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.980
Babe, you want ketchup, too?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.565
Uh, yes, please.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.819
- Just give me one, you freak.
- Meredith, stop it.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.987
- Give it to me...
- No! No!

05:19.987 --> 05:21.530
- Come on, I'm hungry, too!
- You don't get

05:21.530 --> 05:23.615
everything you want, sweetie!

05:23.615 --> 05:25.242
Hey, hey, hey, hey! What is happening?

05:25.909 --> 05:29.162
I don't know. All I did was offer her
a scrumptious grilled cheese.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.123
He's lying! He won't give me one

05:31.123 --> 05:32.791
because you're a hungry boy.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.793
What? Okay.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.837
Can everyone please just chill out?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.840
Sid, I know you're still mad at Meredith
about the whole proposal thing,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.509
but we're hanging out again,
and it's feeling really good.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.469
Yeah. I've had issues with Meredith

05:44.469 --> 05:46.180
way before she clowned you
in front of the nation.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.223
- Oh, really? What are they?
- I--

05:48.223 --> 05:51.101
Oh, oh, oh! I have an idea.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.645
When I was writing my album
in Sweden with Taag and Bjorn,

05:53.645 --> 05:57.357
we did a <i>Stor Dela Med Sig,</i>
or airing of grievances,

05:57.357 --> 06:00.444
and it really helped. What do you think?

06:00.444 --> 06:03.197
Okay, well, counter pitch to that idea.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.532
Uh, what if instead of airing
those grievances, right,

06:05.532 --> 06:07.534
we just bottle those bad boys up.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.454
We bury them deep inside us. Uh, forever.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.455
Mm...

06:11.455 --> 06:13.707
The Swedish have never
really steered me wrong.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.752
Not on meatballs, massages,
or house mafias.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.295
Hm.
- I'm in.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.679
I thought it went gangbusters
with Meredith earlier, no?

06:27.679 --> 06:30.140
Um... Yeah.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.809
Except that literally
everything you said was untrue.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.186
Okay, fine.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.480
I told a couple of harmless fiblets

06:36.480 --> 06:38.273
to feel better about myself.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.483
But who cares?

06:39.483 --> 06:42.653
And I know you lie about your age.
You do it all the time.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.530
<i>One senior ticket</i>

06:44.530 --> 06:47.533
<i>for the 2:45</i> Avatar.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.203
That's not a lie. <i>That</i> is a performance.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.746
That shit takes commitment.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.170
- Ramona. Hey!
- Sophie.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.173
I... I'm in early labor.
I think it's almost time.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.175
- Oh, my God. It's almost time!
- Yeah.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.595
You know Ramona from 5C?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.806
She hired me to photograph her home birth.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.891
Oh, so, the landlord will let her
give birth in her apartment,

07:12.891 --> 07:14.226
but I can't own a snake?

07:14.226 --> 07:16.937
Okay, well, why don't you
grab your stuff and come on up?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.272
The midwife is running a little late,

07:18.272 --> 07:20.148
so you're fine setting up
the birthing tub, right?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.025
Since you've shot a bunch of home births.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.444
Okay...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.446
I'm gonna go lay down.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.031
Kinda wish I just texted you.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.288
Sophie. Why does Ramona think

07:34.288 --> 07:36.540
you have so much experience
with home births?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.501
I've shot so many home births,

07:39.501 --> 07:42.004
I could practically perform one.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.466
Really? 'Cause your portfolio
is mostly corporate headshots

07:46.466 --> 07:48.510
and pet autopsies.
- Yeah.

07:49.845 --> 07:53.765
That's because a lot of my clients
are pretty high profile.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.685
I mean, it has been NDA after NDA.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.646
And I can't name names, but...

07:59.646 --> 08:02.900
one of my client's names rhymes with
Schmilaria Schmaldwin.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.484
Or should I say...

08:04.484 --> 08:05.903
<i>Schmilaria!</i>

08:06.612 --> 08:07.946
Sophie!

08:07.946 --> 08:11.450
Okay, okay, fine.
Okay. So, I lie... a lot.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.953
But not as much as <i>Schmilaria.</i>

08:21.293 --> 08:23.587
I gotta say, this home birth thing...

08:24.046 --> 08:25.881
not that hard.
- Soph...

08:28.550 --> 08:31.845
Oh, shit! Soph...
- What?

08:31.845 --> 08:32.930
There's a pump.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.392
But, now that that's done,

08:37.392 --> 08:39.811
I can get back
to what I actually know about,

08:39.811 --> 08:42.231
which is taking photos of Ramona's...

08:42.231 --> 08:43.565
<i>vagina.</i>

08:45.067 --> 08:46.527
Ah!
- Ah!

08:46.527 --> 08:48.529
Oh, my God, that water's,
like, a thousand degrees.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.989
Okay, okay, okay. New plan. Um...

08:50.989 --> 08:52.824
She's gonna give birth on the couch.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.201
And then we're gonna buy her a new couch,

08:54.201 --> 08:57.120
and then we're gonna spend
our entire lives paying off the couch.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.705
What? Soph, just...

08:58.705 --> 09:00.541
Just tell Ramona you don't know
what you're doing.

09:00.541 --> 09:04.169
No. I <i>can't</i>.
I <i>need</i> to do a good job here.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.506
Why? You won't even need gigs
like this once you sell your photo.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.133
What if I never sell it?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.970
What if this is as good as it gets for me?

09:16.431 --> 09:18.350
Fine. Let's-- Let's cool down this tub.

09:21.144 --> 09:25.023
No! My lungs are not ready for that.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.738
Okay, Sid! Grievances time!

09:31.738 --> 09:33.448
Hey, you know what?
Maybe instead of grievances,

09:33.448 --> 09:36.285
we just do like a compliment
circle instead. Here, I'll go first.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.496
You fine, girl.
Okay, now, it's your turn.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.666
- Let's do this.
- God, they're color-coded?

09:42.666 --> 09:45.002
Okay. I didn't get to <i>all</i> of them,

09:45.002 --> 09:46.211
but this is a good start.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.046
You sneeze like a toddler.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.798
I have a deviated septum.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.301

Hey!

09:59.474 --> 10:02.019
No name-calling, alright?
And these are all very petty.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.313
Maybe we can just fast-forward to the end.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.815
Oh, yeah? You wanna skip
to the grand finale?

10:06.815 --> 10:08.275
And I'm talking, of course,

10:08.984 --> 10:10.485
of the Burrito Incident.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.487
What Burrito Incident?

10:12.487 --> 10:15.866
'Twas the day of Jesse's first music
recital at the elementary school.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.619
And he'd been working
with these kids for months, preparing.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.954
Unrelated, I just started lifting.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.457
I was getting swole,
I started doing meal prep.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.627
<i>I made burritos for the week,
each one with fresh salsa,</i>

10:26.627 --> 10:29.505
<i>homemade pinto beans,
and a smidge of love.</i>

10:30.088 --> 10:32.883
<i>As I was leaving for work,
Jesse, you said you were</i>

10:32.883 --> 10:35.135
<i>so excited for the recital.</i>

10:35.135 --> 10:37.179
<i>And Meredith, you said you were</i>

10:37.179 --> 10:39.640
<i>too sick to go. Cough, cough.</i>

10:39.640 --> 10:41.934
<i>On my way out, I told you both,</i>

10:41.934 --> 10:44.394
<i>"Don't touch my burritos."</i>

10:44.394 --> 10:46.605
<i>And then, "Smell you later."</i>

10:48.190 --> 10:50.484
So glad you don't say that anymore.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.445
Anyway, that night, I returned
home before the recital

10:53.445 --> 10:55.113
because I forgot the flowers I got Jesse.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.032
<i>And that's when I saw it.</i>

10:58.492 --> 11:00.327
<i>Wednesday.</i>

11:00.327 --> 11:03.872
<i>As I looked closer,
I saw a trail of pinto beans.</i>

11:03.872 --> 11:06.583
<i>And on the other side of the door...</i>

11:06.583 --> 11:09.962
Oh! Mm!

11:09.962 --> 11:13.131
I was stuck at home,
starving with a 102 fever,

11:13.131 --> 11:14.716
bummed about missing the recital and...

11:16.260 --> 11:17.636
I shouldn't have eaten your food.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.429
I'm sorry.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.932
Yes! Okay! An apology.
See? That's progress.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.642
Now, please, just hug and make up.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.352
Okay, as a-- as a child of divorce,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.563
all this conflict is making me
very uncomfortable.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.815
You guys keep at it,
you're gonna have to promise

11:29.815 --> 11:32.734
to take me to Six Flags
to make up for it. And then never do.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.445
And then buy me a Six Flags T-shirt

11:35.445 --> 11:37.739
and gaslight me into <i>thinking</i> we went
by saying things like,

11:37.739 --> 11:39.908
"Well, if we didn't go,
where'd you get that T-shirt?"

11:40.826 --> 11:42.035
Let's get back to the Burrito Incident.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.121
I think we're done
with the Burrito Incident.

11:44.121 --> 11:47.165
You wish, 'Dith! There's more.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.292
Oh, great! There's more!

11:48.292 --> 11:50.752
I'm having a scotch!
I'ma do a scotch. You want a scotch?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.379
You two both look like
you could use a scotch.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.882
Three scotches coming up! Okey-dokey!

12:20.991 --> 12:23.493
"I don't have time
to go to your hotel room.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.829

then you are as dead as their wives.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.706
Who wants a spritz?

13:10.916 --> 13:12.793
Okay.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.712
I ran down to our apartment.
I grabbed this.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.922
Yes. Ice!

13:16.922 --> 13:18.465
Nope! Shrimp.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.388

of frozen shrimp in a tub

13:26.640 --> 13:28.183
- Yeah.
- Why?

13:28.183 --> 13:29.601
The ice trays were empty!

13:30.602 --> 13:32.771
It's fine! We'll just stir them around

13:35.858 --> 13:37.276

Anything? Say no.

I just said I was sick.
It's a kids' recital.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.518
What, am I spending
two hours on the C train

20:26.518 --> 20:28.312
so I can listen
to a bunch of second graders

20:28.312 --> 20:30.397
butcher <i>Hot Cross Buns</i> on the recorder?

20:30.397 --> 20:31.899
Mm!

20:36.111 --> 20:37.613
And remember when you were like,

20:37.613 --> 20:40.157
"Push!" And then, she pushed!

20:40.157 --> 20:43.035
And remember when you were like,
"Keep pushing!" And then she did,

20:43.035 --> 20:45.204
and then a freaking baby came out?!
- Oh, my God!

20:45.204 --> 20:46.705
Wow! Val!

20:46.705 --> 20:49.708
I could have never done that without you.
Like, legit.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.878
Soph, you are nothing short
of a lying psychopath,

20:52.878 --> 20:54.421
but you're my lying psychopath.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.759
Oh... speaking of...

20:59.384 --> 21:00.844
There's something I've gotta go do.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.057
Hey, Meredith.

21:06.183 --> 21:08.977
I wanted you to know that
my photo didn't actually sell.

21:09.770 --> 21:10.771
At all.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.606
- Oh.
- But it's fine.

21:12.606 --> 21:14.316
It's fine that it didn't sell.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.028
And that you're pretty and famous and cool

21:18.028 --> 21:20.197
because I did something incredible today.

21:20.197 --> 21:23.617
Something even you've never done.
I delivered a baby.

21:23.617 --> 21:26.036
Actually, Meredith had delivered a baby.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.080
Push!

21:28.080 --> 21:30.582
You can do this! I got you, Jen!

21:30.582 --> 21:33.293
But that's neither here nor there.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.421
And stupid, classy Meredith just said...

21:36.421 --> 21:38.131
That's really cool, Sophie.

21:39.758 --> 21:41.593
Oh.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.471
Hello?

21:44.471 --> 21:46.014
Yes.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.183
It did?

21:48.183 --> 21:50.477
Yes! Finally! Oh, oh, oh!

21:50.477 --> 21:53.981
Uh, just one sec.
It sold! In your face, Meredith!

21:53.981 --> 21:55.774
Whoa...

21:55.774 --> 21:57.985
I'm sorry. I'm just-- I-I'm so excited.

21:57.985 --> 22:00.529
Congratulations, Sophie.
That's great.

22:00.529 --> 22:02.739
I decided from then on,

22:02.739 --> 22:06.702
it was going to be a new, honest,
straightforward me.

22:06.702 --> 22:10.080
Uh, Sophie... Is that...

22:10.080 --> 22:11.790
shrimp in your hair?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.960
Oh! Oh, this?

22:15.836 --> 22:18.547
This is a time-release leave-in
conditioner pellet?

22:18.547 --> 22:21.633
It's injected into a shrimp's body
for added protein.

22:21.633 --> 22:25.304
Obviously, you have no idea
what's going on in the hair world.

22:25.304 --> 22:27.097
I've learned nothing.
