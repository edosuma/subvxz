01:30.780 --> 01:33.140
"Sweetheart..tell me what to do?"

02:04.270 --> 02:07.470
"One look at you..and the
earth slipped from under me."

02:08.150 --> 02:09.669

02:12.310 --> 02:14.790
"I don't understand, baby."

02:15.220 --> 02:17.050

"Give me your phone.."

02:18.230 --> 02:19.630

02:36.990 --> 02:39.410
"But I cannot give
my heart to all of you."

02:39.490 --> 02:41.710
"But they all want to dwell in it."

02:41.790 --> 02:43.910
"Not everyone can
handle its attitude."

02:43.990 --> 02:46.190
"Let me taste that attitude of yours."

02:46.270 --> 02:48.750
"You know I can handle it."

03:35.060 --> 03:37.310
"Crazy.. Crazy.."

04:52.830 --> 04:54.470
Ladies and Gentlemen.

04:54.790 --> 04:58.230
Today's party,
this celebration and honor..

04:58.310 --> 05:01.790
..is for a young
woman entrepreneur..

05:02.030 --> 05:05.750
..who has a carved a niche
for herself in record time.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.390
She completely redefines
the term 'Woman Power'.

05:09.790 --> 05:11.630
So without wasting any more time.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.830
Let's give a huge round
of applause for Janki Exports..

05:14.970 --> 05:19.490
..and it's dynamic, ravishing
and beautiful Managing Director.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.510
Sunaina Janki Verma.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.160
Yeah, Sunaina.

05:26.540 --> 05:27.430
Bravo.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.070
You deserve it.

05:29.670 --> 05:30.510
Cheers.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.110
It's my utmost privilege and honor..

05:33.320 --> 05:37.910
..to invite on stage, the
Managing Director of Janki Exports.

05:38.070 --> 05:40.510
Sunaina Janki Verma.

05:46.130 --> 05:46.830
All yours.

05:47.190 --> 05:48.150
A big hand.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.390
What is all this?

05:49.730 --> 05:50.830
What is happening in this party?

05:50.950 --> 05:54.030
Thank you, and I am honored
seeing you all here tonight.

05:54.470 --> 05:57.190
And friends,
it's the time to celebrate.

05:57.270 --> 06:01.030
This is the moment of
your success and my victory.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.670
And it's definitely
the biggest party for me.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.150
And I know it is for you.

06:10.650 --> 06:15.430
Janki Exports' achievement
..as well as mine..

06:15.830 --> 06:19.110
..is my biggest success.

06:20.190 --> 06:22.910
When life closes one door.

06:23.750 --> 06:27.870
And you feel tired..defeated..

06:28.180 --> 06:35.870
It's just your courage and
strength that opens many doors.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.120
And that's what makes
you discover the real you.

06:39.310 --> 06:40.410
The fighter in you.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.830
You must have heard..

06:44.990 --> 06:49.950
..behind every successful man,
there's a woman.

06:50.230 --> 06:52.150
But I would like to say..

06:52.270 --> 06:57.580
..behind every successful woman,
is a successful man.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.910
So please let me call
the honorable Vice-President..

07:01.030 --> 07:04.470
..of the International
Gems and Jewelry Association.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.350
Mr. Daniele Peterson, without whom..

07:07.550 --> 07:09.870
..nothing would've
been possible for me.

07:11.160 --> 07:11.970
Daniele.

07:18.510 --> 07:19.320
Thank you, Sunaina.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.350
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.710
I don't deserve all these praises.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.230
I appreciate the honor
being restored upon me.

07:26.310 --> 07:31.190
But the truth is it's Sunaina
who deserves all the credit tonight.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.590
I just saw her..and there
was a raw priceless diamond.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.270
And look where she is today.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.430
So please everybody,
let's call it for Sunaina..

07:43.510 --> 07:45.470
..and party with her tonight.
This is her night.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.350
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.910
And now may I please invite
on stage Mr. Muktesh Singh.

07:53.110 --> 07:55.470
Senior Marketing Manager,
Gitanjali Jewels..

07:55.550 --> 07:57.990
..to present Ms.
Sunaina Janki Verma..

07:58.070 --> 08:01.070
..with a much deserving
Gitanjali Diamond's memento..

08:01.150 --> 08:02.630
..as a token of honor.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.630
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:06.830 --> 08:07.870
Thank you.

08:15.110 --> 08:15.990
Come.

08:20.270 --> 08:21.430
Congratulations, ma'am.

08:21.510 --> 08:22.550
Thank you.

08:25.190 --> 08:26.070
Thank you so much.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.030
Thank you.

08:27.510 --> 08:29.630
Congratulations, Sunaina.
You're the pride of India.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.630
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.030
Congratulations.

08:32.630 --> 08:33.669
Let's go.

08:33.870 --> 08:34.669
Excuse me.

08:40.309 --> 08:41.950
Mr. KK, you're leaving already.

08:42.190 --> 08:43.590
Oh, hello Mr. Daniele.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.670
Won't you stay and
say hello to Sunaina..

08:45.750 --> 08:46.910
..the star of the evening.

08:47.230 --> 08:52.670
Sunaina, won't you say hello to Mr.
KK Malhotra of KK Exports?

08:53.790 --> 08:57.710
Mr. KK Malhotra,
what a lovely surprise.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.750
Daniele, who doesn't know him.

09:02.430 --> 09:07.110
Everything I am today..it's
all because of him.

09:09.350 --> 09:10.390
What happened?

09:10.830 --> 09:14.710
I think you're not
too happy with my success.

09:15.070 --> 09:15.940
Right?

09:17.350 --> 09:20.070
Monish. Why are you sweating?

09:22.670 --> 09:24.510
Relax, calm down.

09:24.950 --> 09:26.470
Why don't you get yourself a drink?

09:26.750 --> 09:29.350
No, thank you.
We've to be somewhere else.

09:29.630 --> 09:30.510
Come, dad.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.350
Okay, see you.

09:32.910 --> 09:34.070
One second, dad.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.670
Quite a leap, Ms. Verma.

09:38.380 --> 09:40.510
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:41.470 --> 09:44.790
You know Sunaina,
this is a game of snakes-n-ladders.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.470
You found an easy ladder..and
got to the top really quick.

09:50.310 --> 09:52.630
- But you never know..
- Raj.

09:53.110 --> 09:57.190
I am not scared of
any snakes..or ladders.

09:57.390 --> 10:00.110
I am way above your
snakes-n-ladders game.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.430
Nothing bothers me now.

10:04.310 --> 10:05.590
You have changed.

10:05.830 --> 10:07.310
Yes, I have.

10:07.510 --> 10:12.150
And I had to..that's
why today I am where I am.

10:12.950 --> 10:14.230
And you..

10:17.070 --> 10:17.950
Raj..

10:18.350 --> 10:21.230
Excuse me, Mr.
Daniele. I've to attend another party.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.270
We'll meet some other time. Okay?

10:24.630 --> 10:25.430
Come, Raj.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.680
How dare she look
into my eyes and talk?

10:46.950 --> 10:49.030
Who does she think she is?

10:49.430 --> 10:51.470
She was looking in
my eyes and talking to me.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.110
Has she grown so big?

10:53.990 --> 10:56.830
And dad..did you notice
that foreigner Daniele?

10:56.910 --> 10:58.750
How he was following her around?

10:58.990 --> 11:02.470
I admit that he got us some
big contracts in the beginning.

11:03.870 --> 11:05.870
There are many rumors in the market.

11:05.950 --> 11:09.230
Sunaina..has snatched our
business in Europe, Australia..

11:10.150 --> 11:11.790
..where we had the highest sales.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.360
This was bound to happen.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.470
This would've never happened if
you two had concentrated on business.

11:17.670 --> 11:18.750
You two are useless.

11:19.190 --> 11:19.870
Get lost.

11:20.030 --> 11:21.870
But dad, what's my fault?

11:22.030 --> 11:23.570
I said get out.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.310
Please dad, stop worrying.

11:49.670 --> 11:50.950
Everything will be fine.

11:51.150 --> 11:54.510
This is a result of your naivety,
and I have to pay for it.

11:55.590 --> 11:59.190
That Sunaina..has shaken the
very foundation of our business.

11:59.790 --> 12:01.110
She has ruined everything.

12:01.950 --> 12:03.310
- I am still here, dad.
- Shut up.

12:04.030 --> 12:04.990
And get out!

12:05.430 --> 12:07.790
I said leave me alone.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.910
First time dad's
insulted me like this.

12:12.710 --> 12:15.910
I just realized I am
only a live-in son-in-law.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.910
And I always thought I am his son.

12:20.030 --> 12:23.710
Monish, no need to lose your temper.

12:24.630 --> 12:27.030
You know the condition of our family.

12:27.430 --> 12:29.470
Try to understand Kishen's problems.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.630
Who will understand my problems?

12:32.150 --> 12:34.950
I never treated this
business as just another job.

12:35.830 --> 12:37.630
I worked hard day and
night for this business.

12:38.870 --> 12:40.150
See..here he comes.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.830
- Raj.
- Monish.

12:42.070 --> 12:43.950
What did I do wrong by supporting you?

12:44.630 --> 12:45.070
Leave me.

12:45.150 --> 12:46.430
And now I'm being
blamed for everything.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.430
But the fact is that
it's all your doing.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.430
Mom, stop him..please stop him.

12:49.510 --> 12:51.110
And now I am getting
sandwiched from both ends.

12:51.270 --> 12:51.910
Leave him.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.470
- You're a bloody loser, Raj.
- Leave him.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.270
I said leave him.

12:55.590 --> 12:58.270
- You're a loser, Raj.
- Leave him.

12:58.430 --> 12:59.790
How dare you call him a loser?

12:59.960 --> 13:01.990
- He is a loser.
- Don't cross your limits?

13:02.190 --> 13:03.310
He's ruined everything.

13:03.390 --> 13:03.990
Let's go.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.870
- Raj.
- I am being abused.

13:05.990 --> 13:07.110
Wait, son.

13:07.310 --> 13:09.190
He keeps fooling around,
drinking with his friends.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.400
Raj listen to me.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.270
Monty, who is she?

13:33.270 --> 13:35.340
Never seen her before in the club.

13:35.630 --> 13:38.950
- Hey Natasha, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

14:11.530 --> 14:14.070
Happy birthday to you.

14:15.630 --> 14:18.670
Happy birthday to you.

14:19.780 --> 14:23.350
Happy birthday Natasha.

14:52.620 --> 14:53.950
Oh come on, Kajal.

14:54.030 --> 14:56.910
I know you can calculate
and make a rough estimate for me.

14:57.670 --> 15:01.990
I told you..I will be
at Natasha's birthday party.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.430
Look, I need this report tonight.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.470
Any problem?

15:10.390 --> 15:11.830
No, thank you though.

15:12.150 --> 15:13.340
Your first time here?

15:16.870 --> 15:17.870
Yeah, it's my first time.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.110
Let me guess, friend's birthday.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.670
Yeah, it's my friend's birthday.

15:24.350 --> 15:27.790
- Happy birthday.
- Okay, alright..

15:28.750 --> 15:30.870
- So..
- It was nice meeting you.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.310
You're hot.

15:34.310 --> 15:36.550
Listen buddy,
I think you've had enough to drink.

15:36.630 --> 15:37.750
Let's all have a good time.

15:37.830 --> 15:38.790
- Got to go.
- Hey..

15:40.070 --> 15:42.150
- Let's have some fun.
- Get off.

15:45.190 --> 15:46.150
Get off!

15:52.510 --> 15:53.470
Hey..

15:56.030 --> 15:57.350
- Leave me.
- Raj.

15:57.510 --> 15:59.190
- What do you think of yourself?
- What are you doing?

15:59.270 --> 16:00.870
- I won't spare you.
- Everyone's watching.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.230
Raj, what's wrong with you?

16:16.070 --> 16:18.150
I never saw you so serious.

16:18.230 --> 16:19.550
Forget it, Monty.

16:20.150 --> 16:21.670
I need to find that girl, buddy.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.470
She's humiliated me..like
I've never been humiliated before.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.270
I must find her at any cost.

16:27.910 --> 16:29.350
I need to find that girl.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.550
- See this..
- Come see..

16:32.710 --> 16:34.390
She slapped him only once.

16:34.470 --> 16:37.990
- And your video's showing it four times.
- One..two..three..four..

16:39.030 --> 16:41.590
Jojo my boy, this is my style..

16:41.670 --> 16:43.270
..which is always larger than life.

16:43.430 --> 16:44.310
Now this..

16:44.710 --> 16:46.430
This will hit Raj badly.

16:46.690 --> 16:48.310
Bloody fool thinks he's a rock star.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.670
And always showing off.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.830
Now watch the fun.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.030
I've forwarded this video to Facebook,
Twitter, Whatsapp..

16:56.230 --> 16:58.870
..disco groups,
stud groups..everywhere.

16:58.950 --> 17:01.230
And even to that stupid Raj.

17:01.510 --> 17:03.430
Soon the entire city will know..

17:03.510 --> 17:07.270
..that Raj Malhotra
was slapped by a girl.

17:08.310 --> 17:09.230
Ba****

17:09.670 --> 17:11.069
How dare you make a video of me?

17:11.940 --> 17:13.550
- You call yourself a friend.
- Bloody..

17:15.190 --> 17:16.790
- How dare you hit me?
- Shut up.

17:17.230 --> 17:19.030
You've shown your true colors.

17:19.550 --> 17:20.829
You should be happy.

17:20.910 --> 17:22.630
I made you a star overnight.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.310
What do you think of yourself?

17:24.390 --> 17:25.069
Stop this.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.069
Monty, take him away.

17:28.390 --> 17:29.670
Leave me.

17:30.070 --> 17:32.230
His video's got 10,000 likes, Jojo.

17:32.430 --> 17:34.750
I made you a star overnight,
thankless man.

17:34.910 --> 17:35.510
Get lost.

17:41.670 --> 17:42.910
Come on, Raj, you've had enough.

17:44.110 --> 17:45.550
You looked everywhere for her.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.630
What can we do if we can't find her?

17:48.310 --> 17:49.670
You need to relax, dude.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.310
That girl how dare she?

17:54.910 --> 17:56.590
Why are you getting so worked up, Raj?

17:56.710 --> 17:57.790
Just forget it.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.150
Let her go to hell.

18:01.550 --> 18:02.590
I won't spare her.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.870
But how will we find her?

18:05.110 --> 18:06.630
We don't even know her name.

18:06.870 --> 18:09.470
Why are we ruining our night for her?

18:12.070 --> 18:13.110
Squeeze me.

18:15.390 --> 18:18.390
- Do you have a light?
- No, I don't.

18:18.470 --> 18:22.030
- Then what do you have?
- I have nothing.

18:25.150 --> 18:27.230
But I can see your light.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.350
It's not for you.
You need to leave.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.630
- Hey honey..
- Hot.

18:34.750 --> 18:37.510
Dude, I am never coming
back to this club again.

18:37.590 --> 18:39.150
We need to go right now.

18:40.030 --> 18:41.870
Why are we ruining your night for her?

18:43.230 --> 18:44.990
We need to go right now.

18:45.070 --> 18:47.110
No..I think you should
light his light.

18:47.350 --> 18:47.990
Seriously.

18:48.350 --> 18:49.950
Dude..Monty, wait up.

18:54.110 --> 18:56.470
Look at what's happened to them.

18:56.550 --> 18:58.630
If you don't look
after them properly..

18:58.710 --> 19:00.270
..it spoils the entire garden.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.550
Fool.

19:01.990 --> 19:04.070
Don't let me catch you
again being so careless.

19:04.550 --> 19:05.750
Concentrate on your work.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.470
- Give it to me.
- Stupid fool.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.230
Hello, grandma.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.570
Sunaina.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.630
After so long.

19:13.870 --> 19:15.750
You're looking so beautiful, come on.

19:15.830 --> 19:16.910
Come, sit.

19:17.630 --> 19:19.590
What brings you here today?

19:19.790 --> 19:21.190
How are you?

19:21.270 --> 19:22.990
I am good, thanks to your blessings.

19:23.390 --> 19:29.430
Dear, my blessings and
best wishes are always with you.

19:29.750 --> 19:30.790
So what is it?

19:31.390 --> 19:34.350
Actually grandma, sir sent
me here with an important task.

19:34.790 --> 19:37.990
Your sir is always praising you.

19:43.150 --> 19:44.910
Sir called up from Europe.

19:45.670 --> 19:48.430
I need Mr. Raj Malhotra's
signatures on these papers.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.870
Raj isn't at home right now.

19:51.110 --> 19:53.590
- You've never met him, dear.
- No.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.830
No one knows when he comes or goes.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.310
- Here's some tea.
- Have tea.

20:00.350 --> 20:01.630
Thank you.

20:02.470 --> 20:05.390
Bhola, go check whether
Raj's in his room or not.

20:06.030 --> 20:09.030
Grandma,
when the entire world wakes up..

20:09.230 --> 20:10.630
..that's when Raj sir falls asleep.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.910
And disturbing his
peaceful slumber now..

20:13.030 --> 20:15.630
..would mean getting kicked out.

20:15.950 --> 20:19.350
He's already kicked me twice
before..and sprained my back.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.110
I don't have the courage anymore.

20:21.190 --> 20:23.070
- Go on, go do your work.
- Okay.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.990
Sunaina, I suggest that
you give me the papers.

20:27.150 --> 20:28.510
I will take his signatures.

20:30.350 --> 20:33.450
Grandma..this is very
urgent and important.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.390
As soon as these papers are signed..

20:35.590 --> 20:36.780
..I'll come and collect them.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.870
Give them to me.

20:38.030 --> 20:40.310
I'll get it signed and send it over.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.870
- See you then.
- Okay Dear, bless you.

20:43.190 --> 20:44.470
Keep coming more often.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.350
I really like it.

20:47.150 --> 20:48.670
Fine, I'll come again.

20:49.630 --> 20:50.350
Thank you.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.430
Bye.

20:55.850 --> 20:58.130
Bhola..don't disturb
me in the morning.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.130
It's me, not Bhola.

21:00.670 --> 21:02.210
Its afternoon already.

21:05.890 --> 21:06.770
You're just too much.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.530
Get up..

21:08.860 --> 21:10.210
Get up, son.

21:17.870 --> 21:18.570
Tell me.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.850
Here you go, son.
Keep this envelope carefully.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.850
It has important documents.

21:24.050 --> 21:24.690
And yes..

21:24.830 --> 21:27.690
You need to sign these
papers immediately.

21:28.390 --> 21:30.330
And deliver them to the office.

21:30.610 --> 21:32.730
Grandma, please. Don't bore me.

21:32.890 --> 21:36.010
- I won't go.
- Shut up you fool.

21:36.370 --> 21:39.210
Your dad has such high hopes with you.

21:39.530 --> 21:40.570
So what?

21:42.450 --> 21:45.330
Son, you should go to the office.

21:46.290 --> 21:48.130
Concentrate on the business.

21:48.570 --> 21:51.370
All of this belongs to you.

21:51.770 --> 21:52.970
And what's this?

21:53.170 --> 21:56.210
Always fooling around
with your friends every night.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.170
Drinking every day.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.650
It's either this girl..or that.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.650
I know everything.

22:02.970 --> 22:05.090
Kishen doesn't like this at all.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.250
Grandma, I don't like him either.

22:07.570 --> 22:09.490
Business..work..money..attitude.

22:09.690 --> 22:11.170
That's all dad ever thinks about.

22:12.490 --> 22:14.130
Did he ever ask me what I want?

22:14.210 --> 22:15.090
Or what's in my heart.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.450
If you have so many
complaints with him..

22:17.530 --> 22:19.490
..then why don't you
say something to him.

22:19.690 --> 22:22.490
When he's at home, you're not.

22:22.730 --> 22:25.130
He's a dictator.
He will never understand me.

22:26.650 --> 22:29.970
Okay, son. Do as you want.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.450
But at least come
down and have breakfast.

22:32.830 --> 22:35.510
I've made your favorite 'lasunia'.

22:37.720 --> 22:43.050
Grandma..that's lasagna.

22:43.330 --> 22:46.730
But for you I can even eat 'Lasunia'.

22:47.260 --> 22:52.770
- Love you, grandma.
- Love you too, son.

22:57.770 --> 23:00.410
- You should call.
- You think so..

23:00.490 --> 23:01.330
Vishal.

23:01.410 --> 23:03.050
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, ma'am.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.130
Monish sir was asking you.

23:05.290 --> 23:07.450
- Okay, any phone calls?
- Yeah.

23:08.810 --> 23:11.690
There was a call from
Diamond Trading Corporation.

23:11.770 --> 23:13.690
Their representative
is coming on Monday.

23:13.770 --> 23:16.450
Okay, you have the schedule.
But book it for the morning.

23:16.610 --> 23:17.450
Yes, ma'am.

23:17.770 --> 23:19.570
- Oh..take my bag.
- Yes.

23:19.810 --> 23:20.610
- Okay.
- See you.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.490
Hey, Monish.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.370
I heard you were looking for me.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.490
What's up?

23:26.810 --> 23:31.250
Yes.. I swear..if it wasn't for you..

23:31.330 --> 23:32.650
..work would have been so boring.

23:32.850 --> 23:34.010
Don't start that again.

23:34.250 --> 23:35.130
What to do?

23:36.250 --> 23:37.930
Whenever I look at you,
I feel something.

23:38.970 --> 23:41.170
Monish, what do you want?

23:41.610 --> 23:42.530
Okay, anyway..

23:42.920 --> 23:46.010
Our big boss, the company's Godfather.

23:46.410 --> 23:48.770
Mr. Daniele Peterson
is coming down from London.

23:49.730 --> 23:51.530
Oh really, he's coming again.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.970
This time he's going to
give us a huge international deal.

23:55.050 --> 23:56.050
Okay?

23:56.810 --> 24:01.290
KK sir has said that
you will go to meet him.

24:02.410 --> 24:03.770
You have about two hours.

24:04.810 --> 24:05.850
Here's the file.

24:06.250 --> 24:08.010
- Okay, I got to go. Bye.
- Catch you.

24:08.090 --> 24:08.930
All the best.

24:32.450 --> 24:34.250
Oh man, she works in our office.

24:40.570 --> 24:43.410
Raj..what brings you
to our office today?

24:44.090 --> 24:46.050
There was a girl downstairs,
in the parking.

24:46.170 --> 24:47.410
Do you know who she is?

24:47.650 --> 24:48.890
Not here too.

24:49.100 --> 24:50.930
Here, have a cigarette.

24:52.250 --> 24:52.970
Right.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.540
For your kind information,
Mr. Raj Malhotra.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.720
This is the office
of Gems and Jewelry.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.810
And beautiful girls often come here.

25:08.890 --> 25:10.410
I am not talking about
those who visit the place.

25:10.490 --> 25:12.290
I am talking about her.

25:13.050 --> 25:13.850
Her.

25:14.410 --> 25:15.180
Her?

25:16.370 --> 25:17.570
She is Sunaina.

25:17.970 --> 25:21.410
Our company's Business
Development Manager.

25:22.290 --> 25:24.770
Why do you have her
photo in your mobile?

25:24.970 --> 25:26.530
Sunaina..

25:27.910 --> 25:29.350
KK Exports..

25:30.700 --> 25:34.610
Business Development Manager.

25:37.650 --> 25:39.090
For your kind information, Raj..

25:40.730 --> 25:45.130
She's hot..sexy..but
she's very-very tough.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.210
She's not an easy catch, bro.

25:48.050 --> 25:49.250
You cannot win her over.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.370
Don't you know me?

25:52.730 --> 25:54.250
I know you too well.

25:55.210 --> 25:56.530
You cannot win her over.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.130
Are you trying to challenge me?

26:02.570 --> 26:03.570
Want to make a bet?

26:03.970 --> 26:05.200
Fine, it's a bet then.

26:05.770 --> 26:07.010
You cannot win her over.

26:07.690 --> 26:09.890
10 days..and she will be in my bed.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.290
What? Are you crazy?

26:13.450 --> 26:15.330
You will lose this bet.

26:18.450 --> 26:22.630
If I lose..then my bank-balance,
my property, my shares..

26:23.370 --> 26:24.570
..it will all be yours.

26:25.170 --> 26:26.810
I will be your slave.

26:28.530 --> 26:31.930
But remember..Raj Malhotra..

26:32.010 --> 26:35.250
..never loses a bet.

26:37.650 --> 26:39.530
But what if you lose?

26:40.490 --> 26:42.050
What kind of childishness is this?

26:42.290 --> 26:44.730
You know I don't have
anything to give you.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.050
Even if you lose..

26:50.000 --> 26:50.930
..give me one rupee.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.090
10 days..

27:00.210 --> 27:05.090
We'll see Raj Malhotra,
how you win this bet.

27:09.770 --> 27:12.030
And in India this is
how the industry works.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.330
Yeah, that's how it is.

27:15.130 --> 27:16.210
Thank you.

27:16.530 --> 27:18.530
I know, but I think
it will grow further.

27:20.820 --> 27:21.940
Thank you.

27:29.410 --> 27:30.730
Why are you looking at me like that?

27:30.810 --> 27:32.770
You're an uncut unique diamond.

27:32.930 --> 27:36.010
And it's priceless.
Only I know what that's worth.

27:36.890 --> 27:37.610
Thanks.

27:38.330 --> 27:39.250
Here's the contract.

27:39.460 --> 27:41.450
Oh, let me take a look at this.

27:45.690 --> 27:47.210
I trust you blindly.

27:47.530 --> 27:51.250
All this would be nothing
if it wasn't for you.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.330
This is all because of you, Sunaina.

27:53.770 --> 27:56.330
You're not going to read that.

27:56.810 --> 28:01.370
I would sign my life,
my will, my everything to you.

28:02.730 --> 28:03.850
Really?

28:05.650 --> 28:06.810
Thank you for everything.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.410
I have something for you.

28:08.610 --> 28:09.930
I want you to have this.

28:13.850 --> 28:15.530
I..I can't accept that.

28:15.850 --> 28:17.850
Please..please..

28:19.210 --> 28:20.210
Daniele..

28:27.930 --> 28:29.330
I hope you like it.

28:30.610 --> 28:32.970
- I can't accept this, this is too much.
- Please, stop.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.930
It's a small token of my appreciation.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.570
Please, from me to you.

28:38.610 --> 28:41.170
Well..I guess, thank you.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.050
You know,
I've to get back to the office.

28:45.410 --> 28:46.570
But I will see you tomorrow.

28:46.650 --> 28:49.530
No, I am off tomorrow. Flying out.

28:50.190 --> 28:51.410
Such a short trip.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.890
I am here for you,
and I am here for this deal.

28:54.060 --> 28:54.810
That's all.

28:55.050 --> 28:56.690
- Let me walk you out.
- Okay.

29:00.590 --> 29:03.010
- I am going to miss you.
- So you're going to miss me.

29:03.090 --> 29:04.810
I always miss you.

29:05.930 --> 29:07.930
Well. It was nice seeing you.

29:13.890 --> 29:14.690
Good morning.

29:15.490 --> 29:17.810
You? How did you get here?

29:17.960 --> 29:19.550
Well, the door was open, so I came in.

29:19.630 --> 29:21.050
Shut up.
How dare you?

29:21.370 --> 29:22.610
How dare you?

29:22.690 --> 29:23.490
Listen to me, Sunaina..

29:23.640 --> 29:24.730
I don't want to hear anything.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.370
- Get out you bloody stalker.
- What happened?

29:26.450 --> 29:27.300
- Try to..
- What happened, Sunaina?

29:27.380 --> 29:30.210
Mr. Dixit, this bloody loafer
followed me all the way here!

29:30.330 --> 29:31.840
Throw him out immediately.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.330
- But Sunaina, listen to me..
- I don't want to hear anything.

29:34.930 --> 29:36.650
Call the security, call the police.

29:36.730 --> 29:37.950
Throw this rascal out.

29:38.030 --> 29:40.490
Okay, relax. I am leaving.
Okay. Chill.

29:41.650 --> 29:43.130
What's this?

29:43.450 --> 29:45.290
You're mistaken, dear.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.570
- That's Raj. KK sir's son.
- What?

29:48.650 --> 29:50.010
- KK sir's son.
- Yes.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.610
Did you call the police? Let's go.

29:58.650 --> 30:01.730
No..I'm really sorry.

30:01.890 --> 30:03.770
I didn't know, and I got carried away.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.730
No, it's okay. Please don't be sorry.

30:06.530 --> 30:07.330
Chocolate.

30:08.330 --> 30:10.530
Actually..I've been looking
for you to apologies.

30:10.770 --> 30:14.410
And what a pleasant surprise,
that I found you in my office.

30:14.930 --> 30:16.050
Please have a seat.

30:17.090 --> 30:18.090
No, it's okay.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.370
Okay, as you wish.

30:20.580 --> 30:21.850
Let's talk.

30:22.170 --> 30:25.850
You know, Sunaina..my life
completely changed after that day.

30:27.050 --> 30:28.810
I am a completely changed man.

30:29.170 --> 30:31.850
You see, a man who never
set foot in his office..

30:32.170 --> 30:34.650
..gets dressed and arrives
in the office at 9.

30:35.170 --> 30:37.450
Can you imagine..
It's all because of you.

30:40.450 --> 30:41.970
Whatever happened was unintentional.

30:42.370 --> 30:44.970
- I am sincerely sorry, I..
- Sunaina, please.

30:45.130 --> 30:48.010
Let's just cut these apologies
and let's start all over again.

30:48.170 --> 30:49.370
I am Raj Malhotra.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.250
I am Sunaina.

30:54.570 --> 30:56.930
Look, I've some important
work to take care of.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.450
- Please excuse me.
- Sure.

31:06.410 --> 31:07.570
Okay!

31:07.750 --> 31:12.810
So the guy you slapped
turns out to your boss' son.

31:13.090 --> 31:15.410
Wow! What a lovely coincidence.

31:15.890 --> 31:17.530
It's a crazy coincidence.

31:18.250 --> 31:19.930
What is your problem?

31:21.300 --> 31:23.410
That night he was drunk, right.

31:23.530 --> 31:25.170
And you slapped him.

31:26.090 --> 31:27.610
Didn't you?

31:28.050 --> 31:29.760
You just hit the jackpot.

31:29.970 --> 31:31.930
He's so rich. He's so handsome.

31:32.170 --> 31:33.560
Natasha, shut it.

31:34.940 --> 31:40.690
I don't understand whether I can
keep working in that office or not.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.890
Why? Is he firing you?

31:44.530 --> 31:45.970
I don't know what's in his heart?

31:46.210 --> 31:48.410
Forget him..I'll tell you one thing.

31:48.490 --> 31:51.450
If I was in your place,
then definitely..

31:51.690 --> 31:54.090
Natasha, please. I am under stress..

31:55.130 --> 31:57.130
..and all you can think of is romance.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.690
I am a romantic girl,
so I'm bound to think of romance.

32:00.930 --> 32:02.890
But I don't understand this.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.370
Aren't you bored of living alone?

32:06.250 --> 32:08.530
I want to see you happy.

32:09.050 --> 32:12.250
Why don't you call
mom to stay with you?

32:13.850 --> 32:17.130
I would keep mom with me always.

32:17.290 --> 32:20.290
But her dance institute
is in Pune, and..

32:20.770 --> 32:24.570
..for some reason,
she doesn't like Mumbai.

32:24.910 --> 32:27.530
Don't worry,
I am there with you always. Okay.

32:27.610 --> 32:28.970
- Take good care of yourself.
- Okay.

32:29.050 --> 32:30.730
And give my love to your mom.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.110
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:32.190 --> 32:33.650
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.010
It's from our new contemporary line.

32:41.140 --> 32:42.410
I think you guys will love it.

32:42.550 --> 32:43.810
- No-no..
- Same old..

32:43.890 --> 32:46.210
- We don't like it.
- Not good.

32:47.130 --> 32:48.290
I don't like this.

32:48.530 --> 32:50.570
- Sunaina, all okay.
- Sir.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.810
Please meet our guest from China.

32:52.890 --> 32:53.770
Hi.

32:54.030 --> 32:57.850
This is Ms.
Tchang Lee, Mr. Dong, Tsetsi..

32:57.980 --> 33:01.650
..and Mr. Fung Lui from
Chai-Tow Fuk Gems and Jewel.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.290
- 'Ni Hau' (Hello), everyone.
- Hello. Hello.

33:03.370 --> 33:05.130
I am Raj Malhotra. Please have a seat.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.130
You can speak Chinese, wow!

33:09.270 --> 33:12.050
- Very good.
- Yes, little bit. Thank you.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.730
- Sir, they are..
- Sunaina.

33:15.290 --> 33:18.450
You know China is a beautiful place,
with beautiful people.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.210
And the technology,
the brain that they have.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.460
I think no wonder you guys
are ruling the entire world right now.

33:24.790 --> 33:28.370
And I must say, last time
I went to Beijing and Shanghai..

33:28.640 --> 33:30.810
..these are one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.010
Thank you, Mr. Raj.

33:32.090 --> 33:33.650
When you visit China, be our guest.

33:33.940 --> 33:35.290
Oh, thank you so much.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.090
I'll surely keep that in mind.

33:37.710 --> 33:40.170
So tell me one thing,
how can I help you?

33:40.250 --> 33:42.170
I mean what sort of
designs are you looking for?

33:42.490 --> 33:43.370
Some different designs.

33:43.450 --> 33:45.610
Your company has a
great reputation in China.

33:45.730 --> 33:48.330
- And we love India.
- Yes, India-China..brothers.

33:48.410 --> 33:50.850
Brothers-Brothers..

33:50.930 --> 33:52.330
But not brother-sister.

33:54.810 --> 33:56.730
- So, Mr. Dixit.
- Yes.

33:59.090 --> 34:03.530
Remember that stuff in my cabin..which
has been lying around for a while.

34:03.610 --> 34:04.450
Get them.

34:05.730 --> 34:06.710
But son, it's been lying
unused for over 10 years..

34:06.790 --> 34:09.610
Mr. Dixit. Just do as I say. Go.

34:11.370 --> 34:13.250
And now we're going to
show you the latest collection.

34:13.409 --> 34:14.889
It's called the
'Dhool-Collection' (Dust).

34:16.130 --> 34:20.650
Raj sir, what you're asking
for..has been rejected thrice.

34:22.010 --> 34:25.050
Sunaina, even kids
can sell the good stuff.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.969
Try selling the bad ones..

34:28.770 --> 34:29.850
Now watch what happens.

34:31.090 --> 34:32.770
Mr. Dixit, let me.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.250
You don't like it much?

34:34.850 --> 34:36.969
Tell him to calm down.

34:37.770 --> 34:41.370
And now..presenting
the 'Dhool-Collection'.

34:41.690 --> 34:44.969
- Dust! Dust!
- No-no-no, don't worry.

34:45.770 --> 34:46.810
This is not dust.

34:46.889 --> 34:50.010
This is the royal filtered
sand of Jaisalmer.

34:51.650 --> 34:52.810
- You know Jaisalmer?
- Yes-yes.

34:52.929 --> 34:54.610
The famous tourist place of India.

34:54.690 --> 34:55.650
Exactly.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.770
So this jewelry has
to be kept in the sand.

35:01.990 --> 35:03.010
Look at this.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.290
Very good design.

35:05.370 --> 35:06.130
See this.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.010
These are all unique pieces.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.530
In fact, the one you're
holding..the blue one..

35:10.670 --> 35:12.490
..it's also the Feng-Shui
color of prosperity.

35:12.730 --> 35:13.520
It's nice.

35:16.010 --> 35:18.190
And this young lady, is only for you.

35:18.610 --> 35:20.410
Wow! Beautiful.

35:20.530 --> 35:21.890
Thank you so much.

35:22.890 --> 35:26.410
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

35:26.490 --> 35:28.730
My order, 10,000 pieces.

35:28.930 --> 35:30.250
Yes..my first order.

35:31.290 --> 35:32.410
- Mr. Dixit.
- Yes.

35:32.490 --> 35:35.330
- How many do we have?
- We do have enough.

35:35.570 --> 35:36.970
Okay, so done.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.210
Sunaina, complete the paperwork.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.370
I think the deal is done.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.250
- 'Saiche'.
- Thank you..'saiche' (Goodbye),

35:45.330 --> 35:51.890
And Mr. Dixit. From my side, 1 kg
of pure filtered sand from Jaisalmer.

35:52.130 --> 35:55.130
- India to China, a gift.
- Thank you..

35:55.440 --> 35:56.370
Just remember..

35:56.580 --> 35:57.890
India-China..brothers.

35:57.970 --> 35:59.450
But not brother-sister.

36:03.450 --> 36:04.410
Cheers.

36:06.050 --> 36:09.570
No one thought you would impress
those Chinese the way you did.

36:10.250 --> 36:14.690
On a more serious note,
you left everyone speechless.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.050
I didn't leave them speechless.

36:17.790 --> 36:19.890
In fact, I left Sunaina speechless.

36:21.650 --> 36:23.010
If she's MBA in marketing..

36:23.090 --> 36:26.410
..then even I am double MBA in love.

36:26.730 --> 36:28.090
That you are.

36:32.540 --> 36:35.690
But tell me..what is your game-plan?

36:35.900 --> 36:38.930
What's the point in knowing the plan?

36:40.790 --> 36:42.410
Leave the plan to me.

36:42.890 --> 36:44.490
Just remember the date.

36:47.090 --> 36:49.570
18th July..see you.

36:50.930 --> 36:52.570
Will he win the bet?

36:52.650 --> 36:57.010
And yes, I will win the bet.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.490
Rascal, he can even read minds.

37:02.570 --> 37:04.930
Ma'am, this is the entry
of Singapore's Michael Jewelers..

37:05.010 --> 37:06.570
..which we had sent the delivery.

37:06.650 --> 37:09.490
Ma'am, I've sent the
courier you asked me to.

37:09.710 --> 37:12.130
No more parties for me. Yeah.

37:13.850 --> 37:15.730
Well, I need to take
care of dad's business now.

37:16.030 --> 37:16.810
Yeah.

37:17.130 --> 37:18.370
I am a changed man now.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.290
Will you guys let me work or not?

37:20.690 --> 37:22.010
Let me work.

37:22.290 --> 37:23.170
Bye.

37:28.450 --> 37:38.130
"O beloved..you've colored
me..in color of love."

37:38.890 --> 37:47.970
"I am treading down the
lane..I always kept away."

37:48.050 --> 37:55.490
"O beloved..you're quite a charmer."

37:55.660 --> 38:03.850
"O beloved..you've
filled me with love."

38:04.250 --> 38:15.050
"You made a place for
yourself in my heart."

38:18.010 --> 38:23.130
"My vagabond beloved.
My crazy lover."

38:23.280 --> 38:28.490
"My vagabond beloved.
My brimming glass of love."

38:28.570 --> 38:33.650
"My vagabond beloved.
My crazy lover."

38:33.730 --> 38:38.970
"My vagabond beloved.
My brimming glass of love."

39:00.170 --> 39:04.460
"O beloved.."

39:10.640 --> 39:12.330
- Sir, excuse me.
- Sunaina.

39:12.410 --> 39:14.250
- Sorry to disturb you.
- No-no..tell me.

39:15.130 --> 39:16.890
Actually, it's Saturday..

39:17.080 --> 39:18.450
..and normally that
means half-day in office.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.290
So we were planning on leaving.

39:21.020 --> 39:22.920
Oh shoot,
I was so busy that I didn't realize.

39:23.230 --> 39:24.690
Look Sunaina, you guys carry on.

39:24.770 --> 39:26.090
It's going to take me a while.

39:26.210 --> 39:28.610
Because I am just working
on a strategy for the company.

39:29.210 --> 39:31.810
Its-it's a new growth
plan that I am making.

39:31.890 --> 39:33.450
So I am going to take some time.

39:33.610 --> 39:34.810
But you guys carry on.

39:35.010 --> 39:37.250
If it's urgent,
then we don't mind staying.

39:37.490 --> 39:38.570
No-no-not at all.

39:38.650 --> 39:41.850
Because knowing me,
I can be here all night.

39:42.090 --> 39:42.890
All night.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.810
Look, I've a problem.

39:45.020 --> 39:49.770
If I take on a task, then
I can't rest until I don't finish it.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.410
And call it a problem or my habit.

39:53.550 --> 39:54.610
This is how I am.

39:55.530 --> 39:57.850
Okay, I guess..have a good weekend.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.170
You too.

40:02.410 --> 40:04.170
Okay guys, we can all leave.

40:16.970 --> 40:20.010
Yeah Monty, I am bored.

40:20.970 --> 40:23.280
No.. order a drink for me.
I am coming.

40:26.210 --> 40:28.370
I wonder how people
can work for 8-10 hours.

40:28.490 --> 40:29.770
Well..I'll see you.

40:30.810 --> 40:34.570
You know, I am finding
something very strange about Raj.

40:35.030 --> 40:36.050
Strange?

40:36.700 --> 40:38.010
I can understand.

40:38.410 --> 40:39.890
It happens in the beginning.

40:40.050 --> 40:42.050
Everything seems strange.

40:42.210 --> 40:43.770
Shut up, Natasha.

40:44.130 --> 40:45.610
What I mean is..

40:46.930 --> 40:48.330
Raj is different.

40:49.610 --> 40:52.090
He isn't just into party and clubbing.

40:53.210 --> 40:55.530
In fact..he knows his work.

40:56.170 --> 40:59.850
I mean..he's still
working in the office.

41:00.490 --> 41:01.410
Can you believe it?

41:01.850 --> 41:03.530
I am feeling really guilty.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.810
We're partying here..

41:08.410 --> 41:10.930
..and he's still there.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.330
You're so serious.

41:17.210 --> 41:21.410
If he's working in the office,
then let him.

41:21.570 --> 41:22.890
You can't stay without him.

41:23.690 --> 41:25.530
I think you have fallen for him.

41:25.770 --> 41:29.890
Listen, I am not the
emotional love type, okay.

41:30.570 --> 41:32.650
You're the best judge, you know.

41:34.970 --> 41:38.010
But..I guess there's
something in his heart.

41:38.170 --> 41:39.410
I mean he's different.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.090
He's not the same guy
I met on the first day.

41:42.290 --> 41:44.810
- You know what, you're hooked.
- What?

41:45.290 --> 41:46.410
You're in love.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.330
- You're in love, Sunaina.
- I am not in love.

41:48.410 --> 41:49.210
You're in love.

41:49.290 --> 41:51.730
- Yes, you're in love.
- I am not in love.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.890
Natasha, come back here.

42:04.190 --> 42:05.430
Good morning.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.510
Happy birthday, dear.

42:07.590 --> 42:09.310
Thank you so much, mom.

42:09.510 --> 42:10.750
So, how are you?

42:11.430 --> 42:12.990
I am absolutely fine.

42:13.110 --> 42:14.670
How are you?

42:14.750 --> 42:15.990
How is work?

42:16.070 --> 42:17.710
I hope you take breakfast on time.

42:17.830 --> 42:20.510
- And I hope you don't skip lunch.
- Mom.

42:21.070 --> 42:24.830
If you're worry so much,
why don't you come live with me?

42:25.310 --> 42:26.910
I want to.

42:27.430 --> 42:30.470
Once these kids dance
competition is over..

42:30.670 --> 42:33.310
..I'll come over immediately.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.830
Mom, do one thing.

42:37.070 --> 42:40.670
Buy a big cake on my behalf,
and eat it.

42:41.390 --> 42:43.750
And also give it to the kids.

42:45.470 --> 42:46.910
I am fasting today.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.510
Fasting. What for?

42:50.430 --> 42:53.510
Since when did you start fasting?

42:53.630 --> 42:55.070
Well, it's your birthday today..

42:55.550 --> 42:58.230
..so I thought of fasting, and I did.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.270
Mom, you're the best.

43:00.390 --> 43:03.110
You know I miss you so much,
and I love you.

43:03.310 --> 43:06.030
I miss you too, dear. And I love you.

43:09.070 --> 43:10.350
Who sent these flowers?

43:11.750 --> 43:14.030
Ma'am, someone delivered
this in the morning..

43:14.270 --> 43:15.350
..and said it's for you.

43:15.430 --> 43:16.910
- For me?
- Yes, madam.

43:18.750 --> 43:20.430
- Make me a cup of tea, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

43:24.700 --> 43:28.230
Sunaina, today is the
most beautiful day of my life.

43:28.390 --> 43:29.630
Happy Birthday.

43:37.590 --> 43:39.990
- Hello.
- Hope you like carnations.

43:40.950 --> 43:42.150
They are from you.

43:42.470 --> 43:43.830
Happy birthday Sunaina.

43:46.230 --> 43:47.430
Thank you, sir.

43:48.430 --> 43:49.790
Sunaina, don't be formal.

43:50.630 --> 43:52.390
I am your boss only in the office.

43:53.190 --> 43:54.390
You can call me Raj.

43:54.710 --> 43:55.550
What say?

43:56.070 --> 43:59.990
- Dinner..you and me.
- Dinner?

44:00.310 --> 44:01.590
Yes, dinner.

44:02.830 --> 44:06.910
Are you asking me out on
a dinner date, Mr. Raj Malhotra?

44:08.110 --> 44:09.390
Maybe.

44:10.590 --> 44:12.670
But I am fasting today?

44:13.550 --> 44:14.990
Fast.. What?

44:15.310 --> 44:16.590
You mean..you're fasting.

44:18.550 --> 44:20.030
Fasting on your birthday.

44:20.990 --> 44:22.270
Yes..so?

44:23.790 --> 44:25.590
Fine.
We can eat other things.

44:25.670 --> 44:29.870
Like fruits, juices..sago and all.

44:30.870 --> 44:32.910
But I don't even drink water.

44:33.830 --> 44:36.950
- Oh..okay.
- I am so sorry.

44:38.510 --> 44:39.870
Maybe some other time, Raj.

44:39.950 --> 44:41.510
But thank you for the flowers.

44:50.790 --> 44:53.150
I will break your fast, Sunaina.

45:15.070 --> 45:17.550
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

45:19.550 --> 45:21.990
"Excuse me..wanna
touch you-touch you."

45:23.990 --> 45:26.550
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

45:26.670 --> 45:28.710
"Let me take you in my arms."

45:28.790 --> 45:30.990
"Fix you in my heart."

45:31.150 --> 45:33.430
"Stay away..don't touch me."

45:33.510 --> 45:35.070
"You don't know.."

45:35.150 --> 45:37.350
"The entire.."

45:37.430 --> 45:39.590
"The entire country's after me."

45:39.710 --> 45:44.070
"The entire country's after me."

45:44.150 --> 45:48.590
"The entire country's after me."

45:48.670 --> 45:53.030
"The entire country's after me."

46:10.910 --> 46:14.190
"My lips want to touch yours."

46:15.510 --> 46:19.150
"I want to love you..and
sway in your arms."

46:19.870 --> 46:22.390
"My lips want to touch yours."

46:22.470 --> 46:24.670
"I want to love you..and
sway in your arms."

46:24.750 --> 46:26.990
"Since it met you, it's restless."

46:27.070 --> 46:29.350
"My desires are out of control."

46:31.430 --> 46:33.750
"Stay away..don't touch me."

46:33.830 --> 46:35.510
"You don't know.."

46:35.630 --> 46:37.710
"The entire.."

46:37.830 --> 46:39.990
"The entire country's after me."

46:40.070 --> 46:44.470
"The entire country's after me."

46:44.550 --> 46:48.990
"The entire country's after me."

46:49.070 --> 46:53.470
"The entire country's after me."

47:02.470 --> 47:06.350
"Your capricious body
makes my heart restless."

47:06.870 --> 47:10.310
"There's no peace without you."

47:11.310 --> 47:13.910
"Your capricious body
makes my heart restless."

47:13.990 --> 47:16.150
"There's no peace without you."

47:16.270 --> 47:18.350
"You're my love..you're my choice."

47:18.630 --> 47:20.910
"My heart is all yours."

47:23.110 --> 47:25.110
"Stay away..don't touch me."

47:25.190 --> 47:26.990
"You don't know.."

47:27.070 --> 47:29.150
"The entire.."

47:29.230 --> 47:31.390
"The entire country's after me."

47:31.470 --> 47:35.950
"The entire country's after me."

47:36.030 --> 47:40.350
"The entire country's after me."

47:40.430 --> 47:42.870
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

47:44.950 --> 47:47.430
"Excuse me..wanna
touch you-touch you."

47:49.430 --> 47:51.950
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

47:52.030 --> 47:54.150
"Let me take you in my arms."

47:54.310 --> 47:56.830
"Fix you in my heart."

48:12.270 --> 48:14.430
"Stay away..don't give me s*** now."

48:14.510 --> 48:16.230
"You don't know.."

48:16.310 --> 48:18.510
"The entire.."

48:18.590 --> 48:20.670
"The entire world's after you."

48:20.750 --> 48:25.150
"The entire world's after you."

48:25.230 --> 48:28.430
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

48:29.630 --> 48:33.680
"Excuse me..wanna
touch you-touch you."

48:34.150 --> 48:35.390
"Excuse me.."

48:37.510 --> 48:39.230
- I am not going to blink now.
- No.

48:39.310 --> 48:40.750
- You're going to blink.
- You're going to blink.

48:40.830 --> 48:42.830
- You're going to blink now.
- You're going to blink first.

48:45.230 --> 48:45.990
Hey Raj.

48:47.190 --> 48:47.990
You lost.

48:48.750 --> 48:49.710
Where have you been?

48:49.830 --> 48:50.790
You hardly come to the pubs either.

48:50.870 --> 48:51.750
Just been busy.

48:51.870 --> 48:53.470
- First meet Sunaina.Sunaina, Harry.
- Hi.

48:53.550 --> 48:54.270
Hi.

48:55.270 --> 48:57.950
Raj, that's the same girl
who slapped you in the pub.

48:58.030 --> 48:59.430
- This is nice..
- Dude, just come here.

48:59.510 --> 49:01.110
- Harry..
- Where are you taking me?

49:01.190 --> 49:02.590
She is my serious girlfriend.

49:02.790 --> 49:04.430
Fine, so she is your
serious girlfriend.

49:04.510 --> 49:06.030
But together we've gone
around with many girls.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.230
What's the big deal?

49:07.310 --> 49:09.270
Plus you know she's smoking hot.

49:09.350 --> 49:10.990
Harry, don't talk nonsense. Please.

49:11.070 --> 49:12.230
Let me take her tonight.

49:12.510 --> 49:14.950
Come on..come on..
come on..hook me up.

49:15.150 --> 49:16.150
I said don't talk nonsense.

49:20.430 --> 49:23.070
Raj, you bloody ba****

49:24.590 --> 49:25.630
Raj.

49:27.150 --> 49:27.630
Raj.

49:27.710 --> 49:29.590
Next time behave yourself.

49:29.950 --> 49:30.990
- Okay.
- Let's go.

49:33.990 --> 49:36.470
Raj, mind you..you
have changed a lot.

49:38.310 --> 49:39.750
Look what you've done.

49:47.790 --> 49:50.990
Such a temper..such madness.

49:51.350 --> 49:53.150
Didn't you hear what he was saying?

49:54.710 --> 49:58.030
My goodness, you're so angry.

49:58.710 --> 50:00.230
I didn't know this about you.

50:38.970 --> 50:40.070
I think it's too late.

50:41.390 --> 50:44.030
"O beloved.."

50:44.390 --> 50:45.990
- Yes.
- I'll leave now.

50:46.230 --> 50:49.630
"You're such a charmer."

50:49.830 --> 50:53.110
"O beloved.."

50:53.430 --> 50:58.190
"You've filled me with love."

51:11.070 --> 51:16.110
I brought KK Exports to this
level..with years of hard work.

51:18.110 --> 51:21.030
And now I am watching
it gradually crumble.

51:21.230 --> 51:23.150
Why are our quotations failing?

51:23.230 --> 51:25.230
Why is this happening with us, sir?

51:25.350 --> 51:26.950
That's not the case, Dixit.

51:27.830 --> 51:30.830
Everyone knows about us in the market.

51:31.390 --> 51:33.390
And when a company's
reputation falls..

51:33.830 --> 51:35.950
..then even the lowest
quotations seem high.

51:36.670 --> 51:38.550
No one trusts us anymore.

51:39.310 --> 51:41.350
Everything is almost over.

51:41.950 --> 51:43.670
Nothing's left anymore.

51:43.870 --> 51:45.230
Nothing at all.

52:00.550 --> 52:02.150
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

52:03.470 --> 52:05.350
I called to inform you, that..

52:06.190 --> 52:11.390
..KK Exports has sent a quotation
to the clients from Canada.

52:12.010 --> 52:16.110
I am..mailing those
quotations to you.

52:16.830 --> 52:18.190
Thank you, Monish.

52:18.550 --> 52:20.110
You're always welcome, Sunaina.

52:20.510 --> 52:21.870
I am sorry, Sunaina madam.

52:24.150 --> 52:26.630
This time my share..will
be a little extra.

52:27.990 --> 52:30.710
Don't worry,
you'll get your commission.

52:39.710 --> 52:44.110
Mr. Malhotra, your given quotation
is a bit on the higher side.

52:44.790 --> 52:47.710
No problem,
we can always make some changes.

52:53.030 --> 52:55.830
I am extremely sorry,
but we finalized another company.

52:56.550 --> 52:57.270
What?

52:57.710 --> 52:58.750
But-but, sir.

53:01.310 --> 53:03.670
May I know the name
of company you've finalized?

53:04.110 --> 53:05.350
I will tell you.

53:05.510 --> 53:06.790
Janki Exports!

53:18.430 --> 53:19.430
Gentlemen.

53:20.230 --> 53:21.270
I knew it.

53:22.590 --> 53:23.510
I just knew it.

53:24.870 --> 53:26.430
What are your intentions?

53:26.750 --> 53:27.830
What do you want?

53:30.150 --> 53:31.110
Business.

53:31.510 --> 53:34.830
Good and fair..business..

53:35.470 --> 53:37.190
..which I learnt from you.

53:40.870 --> 53:43.030
Mr. Malhotra, your coffee is coming.

53:43.230 --> 53:45.070
Thank you, I'll like to leave.

53:53.830 --> 53:55.550
- Well, I have your contract.
- Yes.

53:57.550 --> 53:58.590
Sign here.

53:59.310 --> 54:00.270
Pen, please.

54:17.630 --> 54:20.150
Why am I counting?

54:21.270 --> 54:23.750
I am sure it's all here.

54:24.830 --> 54:26.230
I trust you.

54:27.430 --> 54:29.510
By the way,
there is one thing Sunaina.

54:30.110 --> 54:31.350
I am sorry.

54:32.430 --> 54:33.870
Sunaina ma'am.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.910
I must address you as ma'am now.

54:38.910 --> 54:40.510
You have really ruined
my father-in-law..

54:41.110 --> 54:44.390
..I mean KK Exports, for good.

54:46.880 --> 54:49.910
The bank yesterday sealed
our office in New Mumbai.

54:51.830 --> 54:55.590
And..our storehouse
was sealed long ago.

54:58.750 --> 55:00.350
I don't see Daniele.

55:00.710 --> 55:02.390
That's none of your business.

55:04.270 --> 55:08.470
Monish, I think you
have everything you need.

55:09.030 --> 55:10.110
Shall we?

55:10.830 --> 55:13.230
Okay. Okay.

55:15.910 --> 55:17.150
There was another thing.

55:18.430 --> 55:20.510
KK sir got what he deserved.

55:21.830 --> 55:24.190
But I can't see Raj's condition.

55:26.310 --> 55:29.150
Earlier..he was a Casanova.

55:30.630 --> 55:33.630
And now, he's always
drunk..like typical 'Devdas'..

55:34.750 --> 55:37.670
..and keeps wandering on the streets.

56:05.790 --> 56:08.110
What's going on, KK?

56:08.790 --> 56:10.150
What's wrong with you?

56:10.590 --> 56:13.430
You've been taking
lot of stress these days.

56:14.390 --> 56:15.230
Nothing.

56:15.430 --> 56:16.510
Usual business.

56:18.110 --> 56:20.070
There's nothing to worry about now.

56:20.430 --> 56:21.710
No work-no business.

56:33.190 --> 56:34.910
Doctor, what's wrong with dad?

56:35.230 --> 56:36.710
Very high BP.

56:37.470 --> 56:41.430
If you don't take care of him,
then it can lead to a serious problem.

56:42.470 --> 56:45.350
So you my boy,
better take good care of your dad.

56:45.710 --> 56:47.670
And let him rest, okay?
Take care.

56:49.790 --> 56:52.710
Raj, this is all because of that bet.

56:53.190 --> 56:54.710
I won't spare that Sunaina.

56:55.350 --> 56:56.350
You wait and watch.

57:04.820 --> 57:06.820
- Stop.
- Sunaina! Sunaina!

57:07.150 --> 57:08.700
Get lost. Leave me.

57:09.030 --> 57:10.140
What's wrong, Raj?

57:14.180 --> 57:16.220
You look furious today.

57:16.610 --> 57:18.250
Did you forget who you are?

57:18.610 --> 57:21.530
You've become that Daniele
Peterson's mistress just to ruin us.

57:25.330 --> 57:26.450
You..

57:27.810 --> 57:28.850
You can say that.

57:29.210 --> 57:30.370
Go on, Raj.

57:32.850 --> 57:36.850
I won't feel offended
by anything you say.

57:37.530 --> 57:39.250
Please, continue.

57:39.810 --> 57:41.250
Last warning, Sunaina.

57:42.610 --> 57:44.290
Do not cross your limits.

57:44.690 --> 57:47.050
My dad's in grave state
of shock because of you.

57:47.570 --> 57:49.370
What? Because of me?

57:50.210 --> 57:51.210
What happened?

57:52.250 --> 57:53.570
What happened to KK sir?

57:54.690 --> 57:57.250
Oh really..are you that concerned?

57:57.370 --> 58:00.210
Yes, I am concerned for him.

58:00.810 --> 58:03.610
I have always cared for you,
and your family.

58:04.450 --> 58:06.690
In spite of everything
that's happened between us.

58:07.450 --> 58:10.090
I know nothing will happen to him.

58:10.570 --> 58:11.970
He will be just fine.

58:12.450 --> 58:13.650
Such sympathy.

58:15.490 --> 58:18.050
I know you hate us all.

58:19.290 --> 58:20.650
That's not true.

58:21.090 --> 58:23.010
Please, try and understand.

58:24.530 --> 58:26.570
I have everything today..

58:28.010 --> 58:31.330
..but yet, I have nothing.

58:32.730 --> 58:33.450
No.

58:34.090 --> 58:35.330
Why did it happen?

58:36.250 --> 58:39.450
And was it entirely my fault?

58:39.650 --> 58:40.770
I've missed you.

58:41.410 --> 58:43.770
I've missed you every moment.

58:44.130 --> 58:46.170
I want things to go
back to the way they were.

58:46.370 --> 58:47.850
They can't, Sunaina.

58:48.570 --> 58:49.970
I love you.

58:51.650 --> 58:54.770
And I know..you cannot forget me.

58:56.810 --> 59:01.010
- No, it's too late now.
- No-no..it's not too late.

59:02.960 --> 59:07.290
- We can start a new life together.
- No Sunaina, no.

59:07.370 --> 59:08.930
- Please don't leave me.
- Leave me.

59:11.010 --> 59:12.730
Please don't go.

59:14.850 --> 59:16.050
I love you.

59:19.730 --> 59:21.370
Don't leave me.

59:26.090 --> 59:27.050
Mr. Dixit.

59:30.450 --> 59:31.690
Yes, dear. What is it?

59:32.130 --> 59:34.250
Where has Mr. Raj disappeared to?

59:34.730 --> 59:36.050
He hasn't been coming
to the office either.

59:36.610 --> 59:37.850
And his phone's switched off too.

59:37.970 --> 59:39.810
It's hard to predict these rich brats.

59:40.050 --> 59:42.250
He started coming
to the office on his own..

59:42.330 --> 59:44.410
..and now he's stopped coming.

59:45.570 --> 59:47.210
Is there a problem? Should I call him?

59:48.130 --> 59:50.650
- No. No problem.
- Okay.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:04.850
"My heart's restless.."

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.690
"I am waiting for you."

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:14.650
"Ward off the jinx from you.."

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:19.890
"..and chuck it away."

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:25.490
"My heart's stuck on you."

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:30.290
"There's no peace."

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:39.570
"The dreams in my
eyes..keep shattering."

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:47.370
"O beloved..you've hurt my heart."

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:56.010
"O beloved..your
intentions were wrong."

01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:06.370
"Your name make my lips shiver."

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:15.170
"My vagabond beloved.
My crazy lover."

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:19.380
"O beloved."

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:28.650
"O beloved.."

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:32.250
Raj, where the hell are you?

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.170
How irresponsible can you be?

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:37.730
Do you know the state I am in?

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.770
How can you do this to me?

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:41.290
I am so worried, Raj.

01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:42.970
You just disappeared.

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:45.130
No phones. No messages.

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:47.770
I called you number of times,
but no information.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:49.610
Couldn't you even call?

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:53.370
In the last three days
I looked everywhere for you.

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.650
Where are you?

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:57.210
Raj, I want to meet you.

01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:59.010
I want to meet you now.

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.930
You missed me a lot, didn't you?

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:03.050
I..I can understand.

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:05.450
You must be feeling horrible.

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.810
I am sorry.

01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:09.330
I am-I am really sorry.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.410
There's a lot I want to say to you.

01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:16.290
But I can't say
everything on the phone.

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:22.090
Why don't you..come over
to my bungalow in Madh!

01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:23.970
Yeah..

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:25.570
..come soon.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.650
- Can't wait to see you.
- I am coming.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.010
I miss you.

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:34.450
Can't wait to see you.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:16.490
"My parched life..wants
to get drenched in your love."

01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:21.610
"I've the entire world.."

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:26.250
"..yet you're the one I miss."

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:30.770
"I am incomplete.."

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.250
"I am incomplete.."

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:37.890
"I am incomplete..without you."

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:07.290
"You're making these moments..fiery."

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:15.930
"I have been..craving for you."

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:22.930
"My arms are waiting for you."

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:27.250
"I have become your relief."

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:34.610
"I can feel you..more than myself."

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.930
"More than myself."

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.610
"I am incomplete.."

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.850
"I am incomplete.."

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:46.570
"I am incomplete..without you."

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.410
"I am incomplete.."

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.730
"I am incomplete.."

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:57.250
"I am incomplete..without you."

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:25.570
"I want to pick the
dew drops..from your lips."

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:34.370
"And stay close to your body."

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:45.570
"My body's so fiery..that
fuels you desire."

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:52.970
"I'm completely lost..in your refuge."

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.370
"It's lost.

01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:57.970
"I am incomplete.."

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:00.250
"I am incomplete.."

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:05.130
"I am incomplete..without you."

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:07.650
"I am incomplete.."

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:10.210
"I am incomplete.."

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:15.010
"I am incomplete..without you."

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:33.090
Who could it be at this hour?

01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:35.650
Wait here, I'll go check.

01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:42.930
Must be Monish.

01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:45.090
He's so restless.
Monish..

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:46.450
- Hi
- Hi.

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:49.010
How did you like the surprise?

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:50.850
18th July, right?

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:53.930
Good evening, son.

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.250
D-D-D-Dad, you.

01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:59.730
When did you return
from your Europe trip?

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.050
I didn't go there forever.

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:06.450
As soon as I landed,
he brought me here straightaway.

01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:10.890
First time my son's arranged
for a huge celebration on my birthday.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:12.570
- Wow!
- Wow.

01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:14.170
What a romantic ambiance!

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:16.770
But romantic ambiance on birthday?

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:18.290
Dad..

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:21.370
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Great.

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:23.010
Thank you, son.

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:24.450
Thank you very much, son.

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:28.210
- Now he even goes to the office.
- I see.

01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:29.170
Yes, dad.

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:32.650
- But son, why are you so scared?
- No, dad.

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:33.690
Be relaxed.

01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:37.130
And I even heard that you really
impressed those Chinese delegates.

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:39.770
- Wow! Very good.
- Yes.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.930
Sunaina. You here?

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.330
And that vermillion on your forehead?

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:12.930
Dad, Sunaina and I got married.

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:24.529
Stop it, Raj.

01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:26.930
How much more are you going to drink?

01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:28.330
Stop it now.

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:30.649
Stop it? You want me to stop.

01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:33.649
Why did you have to bring dad here?

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:38.170
You know I don't get along with dad.

01:08:38.569 --> 01:08:40.450
I had to lie to him
that I married Sunaina.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.130
I am in a mess.

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:44.609
Who says you're in a mess.

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:47.970
It's like you said, in 10
days Sunaina will be in your bed.

01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:50.529
And now not just for 10 days..

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:52.529
..Sunaina is all yours for 10 months,
10 years..10 generations.

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:53.729
Just shut up, okay.

01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:55.770
You played it dirty,
and you know that.

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:57.609
Raj, I am sorry.

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:00.490
But you know we had a bet.

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.649
And you won that bet.

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:04.609
You're a winner, bro.

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:06.450
You said..

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:11.529
..that if I lose this bet,
then I must pay you one rupee.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:14.649
Here's the money.

01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.170
There's no time to think.

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:23.850
I will support Raj.

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:33.410
If you want his happiness as well,
then just say yes.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:42.410
Fine, then..make the preparations.

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:47.130
Bless you.
Bless you. Now that's like my son.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:50.010
See you then.
I've things to do.

01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:54.130
Invite our relatives.
Make the preparations.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:05.530
Sunaina, you're crying.

01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:13.290
That's enough, dear.

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:18.170
First wipe your tears.

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:23.530
Now you're the daughter-in-law
of Malhotra family.

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:26.970
I'll see to it that
you have a grand wedding.

01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:29.010
But..

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:30.850
I am telling you.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.650
Even your KK sir has agreed.

01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:38.490
My grandson has chosen you.

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:41.410
I will get you two married.

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:50.410
'Punjabi folk songs.'

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:03.850
Monty.

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:06.450
Congrats, Raj.

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:08.370
- Hi, congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:09.370
Thank you.

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.290
Yes.

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:13.090
You're right,
they both look so good together.

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.770
Gather around,
the engagement ceremony's beginning.

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:16.970
Yes.

01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:49.730
Thank you.

01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:51.370
Hello, congratulations.

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:52.290
Hi.

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:58.050
- Sir, this is Mr. Daljeet Singh.
- Hello.

01:11:58.810 --> 01:11:59.690
Yes..

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:01.330
Very good.

01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.250
Mr. Daljeet,
I am really pleased to meet you.

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:05.890
- Right.
- KK..this isn't right.

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:09.210
Why are you angry?

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.330
Honestly speaking,
everything happened so soon..

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:14.690
Otherwise how can we not invite him?

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:17.570
I found out from Hansraj.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:20.690
I mean your son's wedding,
and I don't know.

01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:24.890
I am so sorry,
everything happened so quickly.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:27.530
And..this is just the engagement.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.330
You must attend the wedding.

01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:31.570
Look KK, big or small.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.570
I am going to attend the engagement,
the musical night..

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:37.890
..and the.. What is it called?
The henna ceremony, all of them.

01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:39.890
Of course.

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:40.970
Hello.

01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:42.210
Hi, come on.

01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:43.450
Harry is here.

01:12:46.330 --> 01:12:47.210
Hello.

01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:50.370
Congrats, Raj.

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:59.090
Listen buddy..let's forget
what happened between us.

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.290
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:03.130
Thank you.

01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:04.450
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:05.930
- Hi, Sunaina.
- Hi.

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:07.290
Congratulations.

01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:08.290
Thank you.

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:11.850
I didn't know you're
actually getting married.

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:13.410
Come on.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.450
- That's like it.
- It's okay.

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:20.130
- Let's take a picture.
- Come.

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:24.470
Sister-in-law, congratulations.

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:27.350
- How nice.
- Thank you.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:30.550
Let me introduce you.
This is Janki, Sunaina's mother.

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:31.750
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:33.470
- Congratulations..
- You too.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:37.910
Come, Janki. Let me introduce
you to all the relatives.

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:46.950
Let me introduce you, this is Shobha.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.990
She runs an NGO..

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:49.510
- ..for the betterment of women.
- Hello.

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:52.550
And this is Deepa. Raj's aunty.

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:56.910
And this is Janki, Sunaina's mother.

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:58.630
Nice to meet you.

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:01.430
Honestly speaking, you look
more like Sunaina's elder sister.

01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:05.350
Do you do Yoga?

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:09.350
- Actually I teach dancing to kids.
- I see.

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:12.990
It helps me pass time
and exercise as well.

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:48.070
What a plan?

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:50.070
From Julie you became Janki..

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:51.750
..and trying to get your
hands on a bigger share now.

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:52.630
Wow!

01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:56.510
How dare you try to have any kind
of relations with such rich people?

01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:57.830
How dare you?

01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:01.790
The daughter of a bar-dancer,
a sex-worker like you..

01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:03.950
..is looking to be my
friend's daughter-in-law.

01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:05.230
I heard everything!

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:15.510
It's a good thing I found
out everything on time.

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:17.990
Please don't say that.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:20.430
- At least let me clarify..
- Be quiet!

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:22.550
I don't want to hear anything.

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:25.390
You and your daughter leave right now.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.390
Please..please don't do this.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:32.430
I kept my daughter
away from all this..

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:34.630
..and gave her a good upbringing.

01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:35.990
Rajan, take her away.

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:39.070
- Come on..your game's up.
- Leave me.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:40.030
Leave me!

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:43.870
I won't go.
I will give up my life here.

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.910
I won't allow this injustice.

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.270
I won't let you break
this relationship.

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:49.390
Did you two hear?

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:50.830
I won't allow it.

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:52.670
You won't listen like this.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.830
Now I will show you.

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:57.310
- Come with me. Come on!
- Please don't do this.

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.950
- I will show you who you are?
- Please listen to me.

01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:01.670
Don't do this. Please.

01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:03.590
Let me show everyone your real face.

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.710
- Show them your ugly face.
- My daughter's life will be ruined.

01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:08.030
Now say what you want to say.

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:10.550
Mom, what happened?

01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:13.550
KK sir, what the hell is happening?

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.830
Shut up..and keep your voice down.

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:21.750
Did you tell Raj about
your mother's background?

01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:26.150
Raj, do you know about this.

01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:28.150
About what, dad?

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:29.550
Then listen up everyone.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.870
I will show everyone..her real face!

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:35.750
She was a bar dancer!

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:44.270
A sex-worker!

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.070
What is he saying?

01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:58.750
Raj, try and understand.

01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:00.670
This is a very old thing.

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:05.230
All this has nothing
to do with this relationship.

01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:08.950
My mom started a new life.

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.310
Shouldn't we encourage
a person like this?

01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:15.830
Listen, Raj.

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:20.630
Don't humiliate us like
this in front of everyone.

01:17:21.190 --> 01:17:24.910
A bar dancer..sex-worker.

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:28.990
And you want us to forget your past..

01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:30.950
..and let you make a fool of us.

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:32.630
That won't happen.

01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:35.790
If someone wants to
make her life better..

01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:37.190
Just shut up.

01:17:37.630 --> 01:17:39.390
No one wants to listen to you.

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:41.670
And anyway, dad.

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:43.710
I made a bet with Monish.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.270
Otherwise..she is no match for us.

01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:48.670
This is was just a charade.

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:51.990
And after that,
I am not interested in her.

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:58.310
You're such a lowlife!

01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:04.190
"My past won't let you live."

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:07.670
"I can't see you in pain, dear."

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.680
"So I am willingly..going
far away from you."

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:16.510
I can't see you like this, Sunaina.

01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:19.990
You won't understand, Daniele.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:24.270
Can't you just forget all this?
Start a new life?

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:26.190
Haven't you had enough?

01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:29.950
There's so much more
in life than this.

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:32.430
We can start something new together.

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:34.150
Think about it, Sunaina.

01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:38.190
I can't forget.

01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.070
You've been so sweet to me.

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:48.550
You're the only one supporting me.

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:53.470
But I am just not ready to commit.

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:59.390
There's still something
that..I need to do.

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:03.430
I am sorry.

01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:07.030
Okay.

01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:24.030
Here you go, buddy.

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:30.950
KK..finally I caught you.

01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:33.950
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:37.470
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, come-come-come.

01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:43.150
Hey..this is my pretty looking
darling daughter Sanjana.

01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:44.870
Recognize him?

01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:47.110
KK uncle.

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:50.030
He used to cuddle you in
his arms when you were a kid.

01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:51.710
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello, dear.

01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:53.670
Where are you going?

01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:54.710
I am sorry, dad.

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:56.710
Actually I've to go for Liza's party.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.390
So could you excuse me?

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:01.550
- Could you please excuse me?
- When are you going to come back?

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.710
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:05.790
What can I say?

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:08.750
You're my darling, papa.

01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:10.670
You're the world's best papa.

01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:12.670
- Bye.
- Have fun, enjoy.

01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:17.830
- Kids grow up so soon.
- Yeah.

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:19.750
How are things with you?

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:22.790
What do I say?

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:25.270
Nothing's hidden anymore.

01:21:25.670 --> 01:21:27.110
You know it too.

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:29.230
Business is in doldrums.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.590
Everything's in deficit.

01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:35.430
How much?

01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:37.270
200 million?

01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:38.710
250 million?

01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:40.390
1 billion?

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.150
Your friend's still alive.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:44.910
Speak up.

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:49.230
No..this isn't right.

01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:51.550
I have an idea.

01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:55.430
My daughter Sanjana..

01:21:58.270 --> 01:22:01.150
She's my responsibility
and my tension.

01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:03.390
And your son Raj.

01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:07.510
Why don't we get these two married?

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.110
Your tension will be my tension,
and my tension will be yours.

01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.990
What say?

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:22.590
Isn't this drink just great?

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:27.830
It turned our friendship
into a relation, KK.

01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:06.810
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:34.910
Hi.

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:42.630
Meet Raj.

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.570
Yes, my fiancé.

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:50.510
Hey, you lucky man.

01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:55.910
Come on, let's go to the bar.

01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:57.990
Come on.

01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:02.870
Hey..

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.430
- Some coke?
- No.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.790
- Or something harder.
- I'll have a scotch.

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:12.710
- Scotch.
- Yup.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.510
- Andre.
- Yes.

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:17.560
Scotch.

01:24:19.670 --> 01:24:21.790
- Enjoy, buddy.
- You too.

01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:27.790
Take you drink.

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:57.160
Hey, where's Sanjana?
My fiancé.

01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:34.750
"O beloved.."

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:40.070
Yes.

01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:41.830
Raj sir's here, madam.

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:46.910
Wait, I am coming.

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.270
Sunaina.

01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:50.830
Sunaina.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.430
Call, Sunaina.

01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:56.270
- Sir..
- Raj.

01:27:57.710 --> 01:27:58.710
Raj.

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:01.150
Raj, come inside.

01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:03.430
Carefully. Come on.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:06.430
- Raj please..
- Just a minute.

01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:08.550
- Carefully.
- Just a minute.

01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:12.000
Come on.
Carefully.

01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:13.410
Raj.

01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:18.230
Careful.
Come on.

01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:22.070
Here.
Make him sit here.

01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:29.630
Sunaina.

01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:36.150
- Open the guest room.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:37.790
- And look after him.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:42.430
Hello.

01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:43.830
Sunaina ma'am..

01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:46.830
..I want to tell you
about a deal of KK Exports.

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:51.070
I don't want any more information.

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:54.630
Do not call me again.

01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:05.990
What's wrong with Sunaina now?

01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:41.190
"Spend these
moments..with me tonight."

01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:48.270
"Tease your sleep away..and
stay awake with me."

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.390
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:59.110
"Give me love."

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:02.750
"Give me love."

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:10.030
"Let me come closer."

01:30:11.230 --> 01:30:13.590
"Give me love."

01:30:13.670 --> 01:30:17.270
"Give me love."

01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:24.470
"Let me bring you closer to me."

01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:05.150
"I want to burn gradually.."

01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:11.630
"..in your heat."

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:19.190
"All the inhibitions in my heart.."

01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:26.110
"..let me give it all to you."

01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:33.470
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:36.350
"Give me love."

01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:39.870
"Give me love."

01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:46.510
"Let me come closer."

01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:50.780
"Give me love."

01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:54.430
"Give me love."

01:31:54.510 --> 01:32:02.110
"Let me bring you closer to me."

01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:41.750
"Walk with me for miles.."

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:49.000
"..with your breath
entwined with mine."

01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:56.280
"Let's complete journey first,
and then you can stop."

01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:03.390
"At my threshold."

01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:10.750
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:13.510
"Give me love."

01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:17.110
"Give me love."

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:24.910
"Let me come closer."

01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:27.990
"Give me love."

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:30.870
"Give me love."

01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:38.590
"Let me bring you closer to me."

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.250
Hello.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.440
Who is this? Where is Raj?

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:10.280
He isn't here. But who are you?

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.670
I am Sanjana, his fiancée.
But who are you?

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.120
Sunaina.

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.800
Who Sunaina?

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.760
His first love.

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.520
What? Shut up, you..

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:35.800
Dad!

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.480
Dad!

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:40.040
What happened, dear? What?

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.520
Leave me, dad.

01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:44.200
That Raj, who does he think he is.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.320
What did he do?

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.360
How dare he? He's ignoring my calls.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.080
My calls, how dare he.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.880
So he ignored your calls,
that's all right.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.360
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.040
- After our engagement, I threw a party.
- Yes.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.080
He's been missing since
then with some girl.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.600
How do you know he's with a girl?
Which girl?

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.120
- Some Sunaina, dad.
- Sunaina, who?

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.160
She answered Raj's phone.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.920
Fine, calm..calm down..

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.480
Dad, I don't want
to get married anymore.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.040
You please keep him away from me.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.000
I just can't stand
this guy anymore, dad.

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.760
- Look, dear.
- Nobody loves me.

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.640
- Even you don't love me.
- No.. no..

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.680
- Nobody loves me.
- I love you, dear.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.360
- I love you, dear.
- Nobody loves me.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.360
I love you the most.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.400
- Here you go.
- Keep it here.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.200
- Anything else?
- You can go.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.200
Okay-okay.

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.040
Don't worry, Kapoor.

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.640
Don't worry.
I'll deal with this personally.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.600
I'll talk to Raj..

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.840
..you can't break relationships
over such trivial things.

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:42.920
Okay-okay.

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.960
What's wrong? What did Kapoor say?

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.280
It's just as I feared.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.000
Raj's completely humiliated us.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.840
He's back with that Sunaina again.

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.320
Don't worry, I will talk to Raj.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.120
No.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.720
You won't say anything to him.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.200
Now I will speak with him personally.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:03.880
I will deal with him.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.360
At least finish your tea.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.160
KK sir.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.200
Why are you standing? Please, sit.

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.440
Oh just shut up.

01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.200
I didn't come here to sit.

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.920
What do you want?

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.760
You've ruined everything.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.720
Leave my son alone.

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:30.480
Sir, I was really sad..to
hear about your health.

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.760
If you don't mind me asking,
honestly without offending you..

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.740
..if there's anything
I can do for you..

01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.120
I don't want anything!

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.440
Call Raj.

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:42.760
Yes.

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:49.800
Yes, dad.

01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:55.000
You're so high..that
you've been going around..

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.040
..with the same person that ruined us.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.320
It's all because of her..

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.480
It's all because of her..

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.400
..that the Kapoor family
severed all ties with us.

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.540
Dad. We shouldn't
have rejected Sunaina.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.000
She's been through so much hatred.

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.160
But now..

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.200
Now I am with her.

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.360
Forever and ever.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:36.970
Go away, dad.

01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:39.560
You never understood me..

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.100
..and you will never
understand Sunaina either.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.640
You shouldn't have
spoken to him like that.

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.120
It's not right.

01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:56.680
Nothing is right.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.720
- It's not right.
- Sunaina.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.320
It's not right.

01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:14.640
Its okay, Sunaina.

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:16.640
It will all be fine.

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.880
Okay guys, we all raise our glasses
for our very own Raj Malhotra..

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.720
..who has at last found his soul-mate,
his lady love.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.800
Well..love is beyond my understanding.

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.400
Why don't you tell us
about this real-sublime love?

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.480
So come on, guys.

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.360
Put your hand together
for Raj Malhotra.

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.320
All to you man.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.720
Thank you, guys.

01:39:46.670 --> 01:39:48.000
Where do I begin?

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.000
Now I finally understood
what true love is.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.560
And..

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.960
What started as a bet,
as a deceit, a game..

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:03.400
..soon turned into love
without me even realizing it.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.320
And today she is with me.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.040
I just feel on top of the world.

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.920
- So cheers to that.
- Cheers to that!

01:40:10.130 --> 01:40:12.230
- Cheers.
- Cheers

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.720
Raj, I've already reached here.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.640
We were supposed
to have dinner together.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.560
What happened?

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.280
Oh, God. Sunaina, I completely forgot.

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.840
I am on my way.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.000
Sorry guys, got to go.

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.800
But this party will
continue tomorrow, okay.

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.120
See you, buddy. See you.

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.840
I mean he just left.

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.680
He's already a henpecked
husband even before the wedding.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.960
Raj was never like this.

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.600
- Anyway, cheers to that.
- Yes.

01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:50.000
Hey, brother-in-law.

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.880
- You really took Sunaina for a spin.
- Monish, you here?

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:56.040
You changed the entire scene.

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.040
I must admit..what a move.

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.240
- Hats off to you, brother. Hats off.
- What nonsense.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.200
Whether anyone
understands this or not..

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:07.280
..but I understand
your move really well.

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.080
You see..this love and other things,
it was just an excuse.

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.880
Actually..you wanted
to get your hands..

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.520
..on Sunaina's wealth
and her entire business.

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.440
Give me a hug! Give me a hug!

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.600
Bro, I think you've had enough.

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.920
- But..
- And you keep guessing.

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.000
We're going to party tonight.

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:28.560
Keep guessing.

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.880
Keep guessing.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.320
Keep guessing. Great.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.280
He's such a smart operator.

01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:00.880
"My arms are waiting for you."

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:05.240
"I have become your relief."

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:12.680
"I can feel you..more than myself."

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.080
"More than myself."

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.640
"I am incomplete.."

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:20.000
"I am incomplete.."

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:24.640
"I am incomplete..without you."

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.040
- Hello.
- I am on my way.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.120
I'll see you soon.

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:35.200
"I am incomplete..without you."

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.120
Wow. Sunaina,
what a pleasant surprise.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.200
And you're looking gorgeous as ever.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.200
The same dress..

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:35.000
..the candles.

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.880
How could I forget this day?

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.640
But you remembered.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:46.480
18th July, how can I forget?

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.320
How can I forget?

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.880
Yes, Sunaina. 18th July.

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.680
It was the beginning of our love.

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.440
Do you have more surprises for me?

01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.320
Just wait and watch.

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:02.960
Oh Sunaina,
I am so lucky to have you in my life.

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:06.680
I mean..I am alive only
because of you, Sunaina.

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.240
I love you, Sunaina. I truly love you.

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:11.920
What's the matter, Raj?

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.600
You're a bit too loving today.

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.240
Sunaina..

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.480
..I am so happy today
I just can't describe myself.

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:23.000
You know..for the
first time in my life..

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.480
..I've realized what true love is.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.960
And I didn't realize
when I fell in love with you.

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.240
I just..

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.560
I just can't believe it, Sunaina.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.960
I just can't believe it.

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.320
You have to believe it. I did too.

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.800
Remember? Or did you forget?

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:47.760
You got so romantic, and remember
what you said with enthusiasm?

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:50.280
Remember?

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.080
When I completely trusted you.

01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:00.240
I didn't know..it was
just a big charade for you.

01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:03.110
'And anyway, dad.
I made a bet with Monish.'

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:05.080
'Otherwise..she is no match for us.'

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:08.480
A planned unscrupulous game of deceit.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.280
Just to win a bet, to take me to bed.

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.640
Raj..

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:18.400
..today you're the loser.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.720
But Sunaina, try to understand.

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.760
No, Raj. It's my day.

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.000
Sunaina, forget about the past.

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.200
Things are better now.

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:31.800
Everything has changed now.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.200
No, Raj.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.720
The change will come now. After today.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.760
Sunaina, what are you saying?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:38.920
What's wrong with you?

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.600
Everything is perfect between us.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:41.400
I love you.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.080
And you love me too, Sunaina.

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.240
Forget all this.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.240
Hello, Raj.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.280
Surely you need a drink.

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.040
Come on.

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.280
Bring me your glass, Mr. Raj Malhotra.

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.160
Sunaina, what is he doing here?

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.000
What the hell is he doing in my house?

01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.480
Your house?

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.840
Raj..

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.000
..you always drink so much.

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:08.360
First mistake.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.240
You forgot,
as a gift for your first love.

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.480
You gave me this house.

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:22.600
I am sorry Raj,
what kind of love was this..

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.280
..which drove my mother
to commit suicide?

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:30.080
And I had nowhere to go to.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.960
I lost everything.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:37.840
And the Sunaina that truly loved you.

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.960
You killed that Sunaina,
along with my mother.

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.280
And now you came back to
me looking for that Sunaina again.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:54.680
Raj, your love was
always a lie and deceitful.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.840
This innocent face..sweet talks..

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.960
The pretence of love..

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.920
It was all to take revenge, right?

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:19.760
Right?

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.480
Security! Security!

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:31.680
I won't leave you.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.480
Security! Security!

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.240
I won't leave you, Sunaina.

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.720
I will kill you.

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.560
I will kill you.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.000
I won't leave you, Sunaina.

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.640
If you're not mine,
then you can't be anyone else'.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.160
They think I am crazy.

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.200
They say that you don't love me.

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.280
You won't leave me, Sunaina.

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.320
Sunaina, you know I love you.

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:44.880
I can't live without you.

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.320
And I know you will come back to me.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.760
No, it's nothing.

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:50.280
She is just angry.

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:53.000
But I will convince her. Yes.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.120
Sunaina..why do you keep leaving me?

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.160
You left me again, Sunaina.

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.680
Why did you leave me again, Sunaina?

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.400
I will love you all my life, Sunaina.
Please come back.

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.240
Please.

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.440
Sunaina is coming.

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.240
I do come sometimes for a walk..

01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.160
- Mister..look..
- What happened?

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:19.000
- Sunaina is coming.
- Sunaina.

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:20.920
She loves me a lot.

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.080
- Sunaina.
- Where is she?

01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.200
Sunaina is coming.

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.120
- Where is Sunaina?
- I love her.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.320
I think he's crazy.

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:30.000
Come, Sunaina. Come, sit.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.840
That innocent face..your sweet talks..

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.560
I miss all of it so much.

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.520
'And anyway, dad.
I made a bet with Monish.'

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.160
'And after that,
I am not interested in her.'

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.600
'A sex-worker.'

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:45.560
'Sex-worker.'

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.200
"I am incomplete.."

01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.640
"I am incomplete.."

01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.680
Let's go.

01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:48.150
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:50:48.230 --> 01:50:50.470
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:52.790
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:55.070
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:57.390
"My heartbeat's got no drive,
beloved."

01:50:57.470 --> 01:51:01.070
"Hold my heart tight, beloved."

01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:06.590
"Every inch of my body
craves for your love."

01:51:06.670 --> 01:51:08.870
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:11.190
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:13.510
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:51:13.590 --> 01:51:15.670
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:18.110
"Your earrings shine."

01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:20.390
"Your waist sways like lightening."

01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:22.710
"You shine so brightly.."

01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:24.910
"..even the stars blink at you."

01:51:24.990 --> 01:51:27.350
"Your earrings shine."

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:29.630
"Your waist sways like lightening."

01:51:29.710 --> 01:51:31.950
"You shine so brightly.."

01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:34.910
"..even the stars blink at you."

01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:46.350
"I want to spend
a love-filled night.."

01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:48.710
"..only with you."

01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:53.390
"I swear..I'll do as you say."

01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:57.550
"I am crazy about
your deceitful love."

01:51:57.950 --> 01:52:02.510
"You're the only
guy I am interested in."

01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.750
"Everyone's watching..can't you see."

01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:06.790
"Come on baby, go crazy."

01:52:07.070 --> 01:52:08.790
"Leave all inhibitions, be free"

01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:10.950
"Take me in your arms, and be mine."

01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:13.390
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:15.750
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:18.030
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:52:18.110 --> 01:52:20.230
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:22.630
"Your earrings shine."

01:52:22.710 --> 01:52:24.910
"Your waist sways like lightening."

01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:27.230
"You shine so brightly.."

01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:30.150
"..even the stars blink at you."

01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:44.070
"Drink few drops of
my intoxicating love."

01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:48.630
"And let your intentions sway."

01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:53.150
"Love me..don't leave any dearth."

01:52:53.230 --> 01:52:57.710
"Let your heart be one..with mine."

01:52:57.790 --> 01:53:00.030
"Forget the world.."

01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:02.110
"Come baby, me and you."

01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:04.110
"Play it cool, watch the show."

01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:06.390
"Let the world talk if they want to."

01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:08.710
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:10.990
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:13.310
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:15.590
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:17.910
"Your earrings shine."

01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:20.030
"Your waist sways like lightening."

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:22.510
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

01:53:22.590 --> 01:53:25.390
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

01:53:58.910 --> 01:54:05.950
"I want to burn gradually.."

01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:12.670
"..in your heat."

01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:20.190
"All the inhibitions in my heart.."

01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:26.470
"..let me give it all to you."

01:54:27.150 --> 01:54:34.310
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:37.230
"Give me love."

01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:40.190
"Give me love."

01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:48.030
"Let me come closer."

01:54:49.190 --> 01:54:51.670
"Give me love."

01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:55.190
"Give me love."

01:54:55.430 --> 01:55:03.190
"Let me bring you closer to me."

01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:42.940
"Walk with me for miles.."
