09:04.892 --> 09:06.546
They were minor,but playing devil's advocate,

09:06.589 --> 09:08.852
even if Molly attacked Aiden
first, which I doubt,

09:08.896 --> 09:11.376
her injuries indicatedisproportionate force.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.727
Unless she actually fell.That'd bea pretty vigorous fall

09:13.770 --> 09:15.859
to cause a broken leg.But Molly didn't show up

09:15.903 --> 09:17.252
at the preliminary hearing
to testify.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.994
That raises questions.Like what? She's lying?

09:20.037 --> 09:21.604
Victims in D.V. casesdon't show up to prelims

09:21.648 --> 09:23.911
all the time.Same with trials.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.869
Speaking of, Molly hasn't
gotten back to me.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.959
If she doesn't show,it'll sink our case.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.048
But we have the 911 call.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.702
Mm-hmm.And that's another thing.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.922
If Molly did fall,
why did shecall the cops?

09:34.965 --> 09:36.271
Why didn't the boyfriend?

09:36.314 --> 09:38.055
Because Aiden was afraid.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.057
Afraid for his future.
He needed those minutes

09:40.101 --> 09:41.798
between the 911 call
and the cops arriving

09:41.842 --> 09:43.234
to craft his lie.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.627
That's for coming in,Ms. Park. I'm Mark Callan.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.107
I heard the other lawyer
got sick.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.761
He did, but I've been broughtup to speed on the case.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.371
I just wantedto talk to you in person.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.894
To serve me with a subpoena?

09:50.938 --> 09:52.461
Excuse me?

09:52.504 --> 09:53.593
Your D.A. investigator
emailed me a subpoena.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.724
That's improper service.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.247
I see you nailedCivil Procedure.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.206
Not exactly,
but I do my homework.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.425
And since I just acknowledged
that I did receive it..

10:00.469 --> 10:02.297
Service is effective.That's good.

10:02.340 --> 10:05.300
You feel ready to testify?

10:05.343 --> 10:07.824
Mr. Callan, I came to assure
the new prosecutor--

10:07.868 --> 10:09.783
well, you--that I am.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.523
I know I may not fit the bill
of battered woman,

10:11.567 --> 10:12.786
but please don't mistake
my lack of tears

10:12.829 --> 10:15.658
for lack of emotion.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.355
I'll see you in court.
Thank you.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.621
Can't tell if her poise
helps us or hurts us.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.451
Hmm.
I don't doubt her pain,

10:26.495 --> 10:28.149
but juries latch on
to visible grief.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.238
They want to feel
what the victim feels.

10:30.281 --> 10:33.067
What's up with you?

10:33.110 --> 10:35.025
Opposing counsel
on this case...

10:35.069 --> 10:37.419
- Yeah?
- Emily Lopez.

She seems to be fine, but...

10:39.987 --> 10:41.684
Not fine?Yeah, and I don't know
what to do.

10:41.728 --> 10:42.946
And you think you shouldsit this one out?

There's a conflict
of interest

with me and Emily dating?

10:45.688 --> 10:47.559
It's a gray area,but I understand.Thanks, man.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.952
I'll sit in on Sam's case.

Uh, Sam's what?

in the Raymond case.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.088

you asked for.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.366
So the Raymond caseis in Lola's court?

11:11.409 --> 11:12.846
And Amy Quinn is
the opposing counsel.

11:12.889 --> 11:16.023
Don't most judges deny
motions to suppress?

11:16.066 --> 11:17.633
The implication being
my job will be easy?

11:17.677 --> 11:18.852
Oh, just an observation.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.073
You're gonna kill it, Sam.

- Sexy?

11:37.261 --> 11:40.612
Yes. Very sexy.

11:40.656 --> 11:43.746
So...tomorrow's
my day off,

11:43.790 --> 11:45.313

out to lunch.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.837
And before you say no,

11:47.881 --> 11:49.926
I promise to have you back
in exactly one hour.

Okay. [ clears throat ]

for the croissant.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.384
Well, I'll still be there,just in case.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.824
What is Joshua Raymond's
probationary status?

12:17.867 --> 12:20.043
He's on formal felonyprobation for three years

12:20.087 --> 12:21.784
for possession with intent
to sell narcotics.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.220
Officer Schneider,

12:23.264 --> 12:25.179
what happened on the morning
of January 5th?

12:25.222 --> 12:27.007
At approximately 11:15 a.m,

12:27.050 --> 12:28.660
I conducted
a routine probation search

12:28.704 --> 12:31.011
of defendant's residence.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.752
He lives with his granny,
Eloise Raymond.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.842
I then recovered a 9-millimeter
semi-automatic handgun

12:35.885 --> 12:37.278
in his bedroom closet.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.409
Did Mr. Raymond--

12:38.453 --> 12:39.976
Objection.
Leading the witness.

Overruled.
Let's let Ms. Powell

12:41.282 --> 12:42.849
finish her question first,
counsel.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.460
Officer Schneider,
did Mr. Raymond violate

when you found the gun--

12:46.766 --> 12:48.985
Objection.Leading and legal conclusion.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.901
Sustained.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.294
Officer,
can you please tell us

12:53.337 --> 12:55.818
whether Mr. Raymond's
probation prohibits

12:55.862 --> 12:57.646
the possession of firearms?

12:57.689 --> 12:58.908
Oh, it most definitely does.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.519
No further questions,
Your Honor.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.782
Ms. Quinn, your witness.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.747
Officer Schneider,
did you have a warrant

13:11.791 --> 13:14.141
when you searched
Mr. Raymond's residence?

13:14.184 --> 13:15.533
- No.
- Why not?

13:15.577 --> 13:17.231
Because when he agreed
to felony probation,

13:17.274 --> 13:19.450
he waived
his search and seizure rights.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.930
Meaning his probation officer
or police officer

13:20.974 --> 13:23.498
such as yourself could search
his home at any time

13:23.541 --> 13:25.587
without probable cause?

13:25.630 --> 13:26.936
That's exactlywhat that means.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.590
Officer, isn't it true
that your mother

13:28.633 --> 13:30.984
lives on the same street
as Mr. Raymond?

13:31.027 --> 13:32.986
Yeah. She does.

- Do you love your mother?
- Yes.

Don't you agree that Mr. Raymondis a no-good thug?

13:39.166 --> 13:41.559
- Objection. Argumentative.
- I'll rephrase.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.866
Isn't it true that you referred
to Mr. Raymond

13:43.910 --> 13:45.868
as a no-good thug
when you arrested him?

13:45.912 --> 13:48.305
Yeah, I did. So?

13:48.349 --> 13:50.960
So isn't it true
that your probation search

13:51.004 --> 13:52.875
was part of a pattern
of harassment?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.355
- Objection.
- No, it's not true at all.
