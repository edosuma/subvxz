he's telling the truth.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.905

pay cash to a total stranger

15:08.366 --> 15:10.159
and not get a pink slip?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.965
...you'd know it ain't true.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.133

cut me a break here.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.798
What's the point of this?

16:04.839 --> 16:08.509
Officer, the point is that-that

16:04.839 --> 16:08.509
Joey is just a sweet, innocent

16:08.551 --> 16:12.138
goofy guy who's, uh,

16:08.551 --> 16:12.138
who's just a child at heart.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.098
Yeah, he starts off every day

16:14.140 --> 16:16.225
with The Three Stooges

16:14.140 --> 16:16.225

16:16.267 --> 16:17.644
It's true.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.938
Here they are. See?

16:19.979 --> 16:24.358
Woo-woo-woo

16:19.979 --> 16:24.358
woo-woo-woo...woo.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.319
Woo.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.405
Joey even has Teenage Mutant

16:26.360 --> 16:29.405
Ninja Turtle slippers.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.909
Oh, not the slippers.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.244
This is Michael Angelo

16:36.830 --> 16:39.248
and I don't know who this is.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.250
Because Comet bit his head off.

16:45.546 --> 16:49.216
You see, officer,

16:45.546 --> 16:49.216
Joey is a fair and trusting man.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.177
I mean, like a big kid.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.053
I mean, he would

16:51.218 --> 16:53.053
never rip anybody off

16:53.095 --> 16:56.307
so he would never expect

16:53.095 --> 16:56.307
anyone to rip him off.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.809
Well, I had my doubts

16:57.851 --> 17:00.353
but the Ninja Turtle

16:57.851 --> 17:00.353
slippers put me over the top.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.188
Mr. Gladstone,

17:00.394 --> 17:02.188
I won't be taking you in.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.482
- Oh!

17:02.229 --> 17:04.482
- Thank you, officer.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.819
Thank you, officer.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.819
I...okay, fine.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.111
But don't leave town.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.780
We still need to

17:09.153 --> 17:10.780
ask you a few questions.

17:10.822 --> 17:11.948
And Miss Tanner,

17:10.822 --> 17:11.948
I'm afraid we'll be

17:11.990 --> 17:14.241
impounding your vehicle.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.576
That's okay.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.871
As long as you're

17:15.618 --> 17:17.871
not impounding Joey.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.582
I'll let myself out.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.460
- Joey!

17:21.624 --> 17:24.460
- 'Joey!'

17:25.879 --> 17:27.129
Lucky break.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.506
Who would've known

17:27.171 --> 17:28.506
all your goofy stuff

17:28.548 --> 17:30.299
would've saved

17:28.548 --> 17:30.299
your butt, huh, Joey?

17:30.341 --> 17:31.718
You know, next time

17:30.341 --> 17:31.718
he gets in trouble

17:31.759 --> 17:33.052
he should take

17:31.759 --> 17:33.052
a driver's license picture

17:33.093 --> 17:34.721

17:33.093 --> 17:34.721

17:34.762 --> 17:36.514

17:34.762 --> 17:36.514

17:43.103 --> 17:44.522
You mean, you're not?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.940
Oh, no. I feel great.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.608
D.J.'s present

17:47.650 --> 17:51.029

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
All this time I thought you

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
guys were laughing with me

17:53.113 --> 17:55.909
and you were actually

17:53.113 --> 17:55.909
laughing at me.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.827
Thanks. Appreciate it.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.167
'Joey!'

18:06.794 --> 18:08.796
'Joey, where you going?'

18:08.838 --> 18:11.382
I don't know.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.382
I need to go for a walk.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.343
Maybe I'll go down

18:11.424 --> 18:14.343
and get a Goofy Joey slurpee

18:14.385 --> 18:16.679
and, uh, maybe

18:14.385 --> 18:16.679
look for an apartment.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.681
Okay, but you heard the officer.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.266
"Don't leave town."

18:21.684 --> 18:23.143
Look, Joey, I know

18:21.684 --> 18:23.143
that you're upset

18:23.185 --> 18:26.313
but really, I mean, you're

18:23.185 --> 18:26.313
taking this the wrong way.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.315
We-we need to talk.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.692
Yeah, well, I've heard enough.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.652
Whoa. No, she's right.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.737
Let's talk.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.988
Come with us, friend.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.990
Come on, you guys.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.990
This is ridiculous.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.617
- No, it's not.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.617
- Alright.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.748
Alright, fine.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.748
What do you want to talk about?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.292
You, and what you

18:43.790 --> 18:46.292
mean to this family.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.711
Joey, we love having you here.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.546
It's so great

18:48.753 --> 18:50.546
growing up in a house

18:50.588 --> 18:53.299

19:26.040 --> 19:27.959
So I'm good for a few laughs.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.959
Big deal.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.086
You're good for

19:28.001 --> 19:30.086
a lot more than that.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.129
Joey, you've pulled this family

19:31.170 --> 19:32.630
through a lot of rough times.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.549
Yeah, like remember when

19:32.672 --> 19:35.549
I was afraid of the dentist?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.217
You were there to make it okay.

Look. We're in luck.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.056
A courage detector.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.809
Last time I was here

19:42.098 --> 19:44.809
it was a spit sucker.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.855
Well, it does that, too.

- Really?

20:04.328 --> 20:07.456
- Yeah. Here, take a look.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.083
See?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.459
See in the back

of your throat there

20:10.501 --> 20:13.337
that little hangy-ball thing?

Hey, yeah. What is that?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.133
That's your courage hangy-ball.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.510
I thought that

20:17.175 --> 20:19.510
was there for decoration.

20:22.388 --> 20:26.142
You see, Joey? If it wasn't for

20:22.388 --> 20:26.142
you, I wouldn't have any teeth.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.772
And I'd be still

20:28.435 --> 20:31.772
riding a tricycle.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.942
You see, Joey? You taught

20:31.814 --> 20:34.942
her how to ride a two-wheeler.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.986
I let her fall into the bushes.

No way. Not until you say so.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.121
Okay, let's do it!

20:48.288 --> 20:51.042
Alright, you're

20:48.288 --> 20:51.042
doing it, Michelle.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.085
Let go!

20:52.126 --> 20:53.627
Are you sure?

20:53.669 --> 20:54.670
Let go!

20:54.712 --> 20:56.630
Are you really, really sure?

20:56.672 --> 20:59.508

'Way to go!'

You did it all by yourself.

Uh-uh, Joey. I did it with you.

So there's no way

21:19.820 --> 21:21.114
you're leaving this house.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.740
Because you were

21:21.155 --> 21:22.740
there for the girls

21:22.782 --> 21:24.909
and I want you to be

21:22.782 --> 21:24.909
there for my kids.

about what happened

21:48.307 --> 21:50.350
Until I met you guys

21:50.392 --> 21:53.562

21:50.392 --> 21:53.562
to be a part of a family.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.693

21:56.482 --> 21:59.693

and wish I was a part

22:01.112 --> 22:02.863

22:06.659 --> 22:09.287

22:11.247 --> 22:14.708
moved in with you guys..

you're gonna stay?
