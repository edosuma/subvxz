WEBVTT

00:19.833 --> 00:21.458
<i>This is Europe.</i>

00:22.333 --> 00:25.750
<i>In England,
the city of Coventry is burning.</i>

00:26.250 --> 00:31.000
<i>Since August, the Luftwaffe have dropped
200 tons of bombs there,</i>

00:31.000 --> 00:34.375
<i>murdering hundreds of people
and injuring many more.</i>

00:35.125 --> 00:37.375
<i>The Germans raided again last night,</i>

00:37.375 --> 00:41.166
<i>knocking out utilities
and setting the city on fire.</i>

00:51.833 --> 00:54.375
You're doing it wrong again.
- Ugh.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.458
You're making this so complicated.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.750
It's really not.

00:58.750 --> 01:02.291
That lipstick is the only way
to get a camera into the damn prison.

01:04.833 --> 01:08.500
It's been almost five months since
these men were captured at Dunkirk.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.250
The Nazis are
bombing the hell out of Great Britain.

01:11.250 --> 01:14.333
You don't have to convince me
of the mission. I volunteered.

01:16.958 --> 01:17.916
Try it again.

01:21.458 --> 01:22.625
Apply the lipstick.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.916
Use the compact to hide your hand
as you click the camera.

01:26.916 --> 01:29.666
- While the guard is there?
- Say you have to freshen up.

01:30.166 --> 01:33.458
- You know nothing of lipstick.
- You'd be surprised.

01:33.458 --> 01:34.750
Be my guest.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.583
You're holding it wrong.

01:46.083 --> 01:50.250
- Hm. How will you press the button?
- Could you just give me a moment?

01:53.083 --> 01:54.708
Mm-mm-mm!
- Damn it!

01:56.916 --> 02:01.250
The roll of film is under the lipstick.
The tiny lens is on the bottom.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.083
Aim it at their faces,

02:03.083 --> 02:05.791
and tell them to look at you.

02:05.791 --> 02:09.708
There are 12 shots on the roll.
I just used one, so you have 11 left.

02:10.791 --> 02:11.875
Okay.

02:41.583 --> 02:45.375
Monsieur Fry! Sit down.
We were just talking about you.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.333
Miss Aube.

02:50.333 --> 02:54.333
The six of hands and the keyhole are
perfectly obvious, of course.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.916
Poor, kind Mr. Fry, you're here all alone.

02:58.375 --> 03:02.500
But what intrigues me is
the eye in the window.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.458
Wait.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.000
Hm.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.041
Of course.
It makes perfect sense.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.541
He's totally alienated from himself.

03:13.041 --> 03:16.041
These cards present
a great opportunity for you.

03:16.041 --> 03:16.958
See,

03:18.041 --> 03:20.583
we've been here
at the villa for a month already.

03:20.583 --> 03:23.458
We've been watching you.
You must turn inwards

03:23.458 --> 03:26.958
and listen to your primal impulses
to liberate yourself.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.875
Trusting the great light
will emerge from overwhelming darkness.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.875
You think you can learn
everything you need to know

03:36.875 --> 03:39.166
from the news on the radio, don't you?

03:39.166 --> 03:41.083
As a journalist, I suppose I do, yes.

03:41.083 --> 03:44.458
By the time it's on the radio,
it's already yesterday's news.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.041
We wanna know what's happening right now.

03:48.375 --> 03:51.916
If you see the present clearly,
the future holds no threat.

03:56.708 --> 04:00.250
Do these cards show you
where I might find Max Ernst?

04:00.250 --> 04:01.625
- Hm.

04:02.625 --> 04:05.083
- Ah!
- I think he is in the pool.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.500
Thanks a lot.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.791
Mr. Ernst!

04:11.791 --> 04:12.625
Oh.

04:14.291 --> 04:15.833
Uh, I have some news for you.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.458
Uh...

04:21.458 --> 04:25.916
After some considerable pressure
from the Museum of Modern Art in New York,

04:25.916 --> 04:30.416
the US government has finally
issued you an entry visa.

04:31.125 --> 04:32.833
Oh, thank you.

04:34.958 --> 04:38.875
You and your wife can now, uh,
legally emigrate to the United States.

04:40.958 --> 04:42.750
My wife? Marie-Berthe?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.416
No, uh, let me look at this. Sorry.

04:46.541 --> 04:47.500
Uh...

04:48.541 --> 04:49.750
Luise Strauss-Ernst?

04:50.250 --> 04:53.041
We divorced in 1927.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.375
It says she's in Marseille.
- Not with me.

04:56.375 --> 04:59.333
So are you planning to travel to America
with her or not?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.916
I would do it. I'd even remarry her,

05:02.916 --> 05:06.458
but I haven't seen her in years
and I'm married to someone else.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.500
Marie-Berthe.
- Exactly.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.583
Very complicated.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.250
You've never loved
more than one person at once?

05:13.250 --> 05:15.875
I've been married to the same woman
for nine years.

05:16.666 --> 05:18.458
And... And... And where's she?

05:19.625 --> 05:21.250
You know, the point, Mr. Fry,

05:21.250 --> 05:24.333
is that I'm here in Marseille
heartbroken and alone.

05:24.333 --> 05:25.416
Haven't you noticed?

05:25.416 --> 05:29.458
I was put in the camp,
and my love abandoned me.

05:29.458 --> 05:30.708
This was her robe.

05:32.041 --> 05:36.000
But she was not my wife.
She was a beautiful English painter.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.708
You feel that?

05:41.833 --> 05:42.833
Broken.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.625
I'm gonna hold onto this.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.458
- Did you hear the news?
- Hm.

05:55.416 --> 05:58.666
- Willkie's ahead across the Northeast.
I mean Coventry.

05:58.666 --> 06:02.333
It's all over the radio now.
The Luftwaffe bombed the hell out of it.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.333
Major civilian casualties.
Whole city's on fire.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.791
They don't call it blitzkrieg for nothing.

06:07.791 --> 06:10.958
Now, why is Churchill letting
these people get slaughtered?

06:10.958 --> 06:13.958
The sooner the British accept
the reality of the situation,

06:13.958 --> 06:17.500
the better it'll be for all,
including the good citizens of Coventry.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.708
You think the Germans will win this thing.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.333
Look around you, Bingham.
Resistance is waning.

06:23.333 --> 06:27.375
Fascists in Italy, Spain,
Germany, now most of France.

06:27.375 --> 06:30.458
This is the new world order. Us and them.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.416
Democracy and fascism.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.875
Two superpowers.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.583
Jesus.

06:36.083 --> 06:40.375
It's not like they're Communists. At least
they still believe in free enterprise.

06:40.375 --> 06:44.000
Henry Ford sold over 60,000 Model Cs
in Germany in the last five years.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.833
- We have to work with these people.
Here you go.

06:46.833 --> 06:47.916
Thanks, Steve.

06:50.708 --> 06:53.208
You're talking about
doing business with Nazis.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.000
America's business is business, Bingham.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.000
Going forward,
it only makes good common sense

07:00.000 --> 07:01.541
to shore up our position at home

07:01.541 --> 07:04.625
and protect our interests abroad.
Anything to avoid more war.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.000
Willkie understands that.
And when he gets elected next week,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.375
believe me, the US government's
gonna be singing a very different tune.

07:39.666 --> 07:43.375
Victor, take the art into the house.
We can't leave it baking in the car.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.208
Hello?

07:48.666 --> 07:50.041
- Peggy?
- Oh!

07:50.041 --> 07:53.625
Wow! [chuckles] If it isn't
Miss Mary Jayne Gold of Chicago.

07:53.625 --> 07:57.583
I haven't seen you since...
When was it? Gstaad? Yes!

07:57.583 --> 07:58.833
Winter of 1937.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.083
What are you still doing here?

08:01.083 --> 08:03.250
- There's a war on.
- Is there?

08:03.250 --> 08:05.625
- And where are you off to?
- Oh, the tailor.

08:05.625 --> 08:06.958
And how's your father?

08:06.958 --> 08:08.250
I wouldn't know.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.166
I'm doing the rounds down south
before I head back to New York.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.458
- Victor and I just cleaned out Picasso.
- These ones are mine.

08:14.458 --> 08:18.583
Marcel Duchamp tells me that Max Ernst
has been living here. Is that true?

08:18.583 --> 08:20.583
In the flesh.
- And you are?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.958
In a hurry. Oh, so good to see you, Peggy!

08:25.625 --> 08:26.958
- Okay.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.166
Victor!

08:48.375 --> 08:50.750
Comrades! Good morning.

08:51.416 --> 08:54.750
Look who's here.
Who was the lucky lady last night?

08:55.958 --> 08:56.833
Ladies.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.416
Two women?
How do you give both enough attention?

09:01.416 --> 09:04.791
It's because I'm an economist.
Increase demand, increase supply.

09:06.375 --> 09:10.333
But what about Miss Mary Jayne Gold?
I see how she looks at you.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.583
Yeah, she looks at me the same way
that she looks at a dog.

09:14.583 --> 09:19.375
Doesn't she have something going on
with the American consul? Uh, Patterson?

09:19.375 --> 09:20.666
Why would you think that?

09:20.666 --> 09:22.708
He's come to the lobby
to pick her up.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.041
He's a chatty one.

09:26.916 --> 09:29.166
Why are you keeping track
of her private life?

09:29.166 --> 09:33.041
I'm the concierge of this hotel.
Eyes and ears. I keep track of everything.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.000
And you have to stop distracting yourself.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.958
You're in pain. We all are.

09:37.958 --> 09:41.458
But what you are getting
from these women is just temporary relief.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.625
We must channel all our–

09:43.625 --> 09:47.458
...energy into revolution! Yes, I know!
I am getting people out every day.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.541
I am talking about fighting back.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.125
Weapons?

09:54.125 --> 09:55.208
Weapons?

09:55.208 --> 09:56.625
Paul, no.

09:56.625 --> 10:00.375
When the French army demobilized,
we dropped our guns and walked away.

10:00.375 --> 10:03.708
There must be piles of weapons
buried all over this country.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.208
We need a concrete plan
and to recruit more people.

10:11.916 --> 10:15.583
There I was, running around Paris,
trying to hide my collection.

10:15.583 --> 10:19.125
I wanted to start
in the basement vaults of the Louvre,

10:19.125 --> 10:21.916
but the curators were busy
worrying about the Mona Lisa

10:21.916 --> 10:25.708
to bother with my stash
of worthless modern paintings.

10:25.708 --> 10:30.458
So, finally, I managed to convince
some museum underlings

10:30.458 --> 10:32.500
to crate it up and ship it for me.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.083
They had to put "household items"
on the export forms.

10:38.083 --> 10:42.166
God help me if Vichy bureaucrats
are smart enough to look inside.

10:42.166 --> 10:45.333
Hopefully, it's on its way
to New York already on a boat.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.333
Lucky paintings.
Mm.

10:47.333 --> 10:50.875
Victor's upset 'cause we've been trying
to get Alfred Barr of the MoMA

10:50.875 --> 10:53.958
to write an affidavit of moral support
since the summer.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.291
I might have to marry him to get him out.

10:57.416 --> 10:58.500
Don't laugh.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.833
Just give it time, Victor.
He finally came through for Max this week.

11:02.833 --> 11:06.208
Lucky Max.
- He's not the only one waiting for a visa.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.791
Barr is overwhelmed
with all the appeals for help from Europe.

11:10.791 --> 11:13.625
-<i>He's</i> overwhelmed?
- He's put his wife in charge.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.541
- Can you imagine?
- Marga?

11:15.541 --> 11:19.041
That's a great idea.
I knew her at Harvard. She's pushy.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.333
Which gives me a great idea.
Why don't you help me?

11:23.333 --> 11:25.833
Me? [scoffs] God no.

11:25.833 --> 11:29.000
What if I get arrested
or, worse, expatriated?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.583
I'm not insane, Varian.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.291
Don't forget, unlike you, I'm a Jew.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.708
Got caught up in a hotel raid
only last week.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.541
I'm on the next plane
straight out of here.

11:44.708 --> 11:45.708
Miss Guggenheim.

11:47.666 --> 11:48.583
Call me Peggy.

11:52.208 --> 11:53.083
It's gorgeous.

11:53.916 --> 11:55.291
It's strange.

11:55.875 --> 11:56.875
I love it.

11:58.541 --> 12:02.000
I'll take all of it. I wanna take it all
back to New York with me.

12:02.791 --> 12:03.708
Peggy.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.416
Tomorrow is my birthday.

12:06.416 --> 12:08.416
You must be my birthday present.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.875
Let's throw you a birthday party!

12:12.458 --> 12:16.666
You know, in Köln, when I was a kid,
we always, uh, toasted at midnight

12:17.291 --> 12:19.541
going into the birthday.

12:19.541 --> 12:21.000
<i>Reinfeiern.</i>

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Huh.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.208
Well, then, that's just what we'll do.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.708
This is Camp des Milles.

12:41.333 --> 12:45.541
Here's the first of your false passports.
Do you remember all the prisoners' names?

12:45.541 --> 12:47.083
Michael Bretherton...

12:48.916 --> 12:50.458
Ian Canning, Dennie Williams.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.750
They need to peel off
when out doing labor.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.583
If they can get to the villa,
we'll get them to England.

12:55.583 --> 12:58.375
Am I supposed to tell them this
in some sort of code?

12:59.666 --> 13:01.958
- English is the code.
- Oh.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.541
You can safely assume
the guards don't speak English,

13:04.541 --> 13:06.458
especially if you speak quickly.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.666
Okay.

13:07.666 --> 13:11.833
They eat lunch in shifts. Time it right
and we'll get a different guard each time.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.125
If someone comes snooping around,

13:17.125 --> 13:20.875
just pull out, drive around
for a few minutes, and then meet me here.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.875
I don't know how to drive a car.

13:23.416 --> 13:24.583
Seriously?

13:43.250 --> 13:45.000
Hello, madam.
- Hello.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.458
I'm here to see my husband
Michael Bretherton.

13:47.458 --> 13:50.375
My husband.
- Bretherton?

13:51.500 --> 13:52.416
Let's see.

13:53.958 --> 13:54.791
Yes.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.333
Proof of identity?

14:06.416 --> 14:08.416
A visitor for Bretherton in Block D.

14:14.416 --> 14:16.041
- Thank you. Open up!
- Thank you.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.083
Yes. See you later.

14:42.541 --> 14:45.041
They're throwing a birthday party
for Max Ernst tonight.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.250
Thank you.

14:46.875 --> 14:50.291
Many artists will be there.
Duchamp, Chagall...

14:50.291 --> 14:51.208
Chagall?

14:51.916 --> 14:54.000
Could be your chance
to convince him to leave.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.458
What about Ernst's first wife?

14:56.458 --> 14:58.708
- How many does he have?
Too many.

14:59.291 --> 15:04.708
Turns out that the woman listed
on his entry visa to the United States

15:04.708 --> 15:10.000
divorced him in 1927.
And she's somewhere in Marseille.

15:10.750 --> 15:15.375
- Let's find her.
- Well, we can try. It's Luise Strauss.

15:19.791 --> 15:23.250
What if the U.S. doesn't let him
into the country without his ex-wife?

15:23.250 --> 15:25.583
Maybe they can split it.
I'll talk to Bingham.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.583
The MoMA reached out
to Patterson directly,

15:27.583 --> 15:30.166
so we have to go through him.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.208
I'll do it.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.750
Talk to Patterson?

15:33.750 --> 15:34.708
Why not?

15:35.875 --> 15:37.000
I'm happy to do it.

15:38.666 --> 15:39.583
Okay.

15:40.708 --> 15:43.583
Go on! Move! Go on!

15:50.000 --> 15:51.125
Your wife.

15:51.125 --> 15:52.875
I don't have a wife.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.333
Oh, darling,
you're just as much of a joker

15:55.333 --> 15:56.875
as the day we got married.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.333
Go on.

16:04.666 --> 16:07.708
Hello, darling.
Mutual friends sent me.

16:07.708 --> 16:11.000
I'm staying at the Villa Air-Bel
just east of here.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.500
Meet me there
as soon as you can get away from work

16:13.500 --> 16:17.041
so we can get you home
as soon as possible. Do you understand?

16:21.208 --> 16:23.166
Hold still. Look right here.

16:29.708 --> 16:30.875
I got the picture.

16:37.916 --> 16:38.958
Two more to go.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.791
Hello, darling.
It's so good to see you.

17:20.666 --> 17:23.458
Excuse me. That's Elizabeth Arden.

17:29.041 --> 17:30.833
That color is discontinued.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.250
Thank you.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.375
I love you, and I will be in touch.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.416
Slide over.

17:54.833 --> 17:56.708
That was a close one. Let's go.

18:21.916 --> 18:23.333
Oh. Let's go.

18:34.291 --> 18:35.416
Excuse me.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.416
Where are they?

18:44.416 --> 18:46.875
Last I heard, at the Splendide.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.916
Well, but they are not there now.
I saw Walter Benjamin myself.

18:50.916 --> 18:52.458
Then he disappeared.

18:52.958 --> 18:55.958
Two days later,
we found his body dead in Spain.

18:56.875 --> 18:57.750
Really?

18:57.750 --> 18:59.958
Yeah. And now nothing.

18:59.958 --> 19:03.125
Max Ernst, André Breton,

19:03.125 --> 19:05.458
Hans Bellmer, Marcel Duchamp,

19:05.458 --> 19:07.500
Alma Mahler, Franz Werfel,

19:07.500 --> 19:09.375
Heinrich Mann, Golo Mann...

19:10.208 --> 19:13.125
We know that
Mr. Chagall is still in his cottage,

19:13.625 --> 19:15.458
but what about the others?

19:17.750 --> 19:18.750
Your

19:20.041 --> 19:24.708
American Emergency Rescue Committee
set up in a new place in Marseille, uh?

19:24.708 --> 19:28.208
We watch the lines of people
waiting day and night,

19:28.208 --> 19:29.541
but all nobodies.

19:30.291 --> 19:33.041
All the important people
on Mr. Fry's list,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
they're gone.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.916
Maybe they're flying them out of here
on hot air balloons.

19:49.916 --> 19:51.958
- What?
- Out of sight, out of mind.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.166
You should be glad.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.458
No, the Germans are not glad.
And I am not glad.

19:56.458 --> 20:00.375
You are responsible for these Americans,
and they are making a fool of me.

20:00.375 --> 20:02.291
I want to go through these people

20:02.291 --> 20:07.291
working on this committee with you now,

20:07.291 --> 20:08.375
one by one.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.583
I just need a pen.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.375
This one.

20:14.500 --> 20:18.583
Mary Jayne Gold's father is
an old friend of the family. Sensible guy.

20:18.583 --> 20:22.125
He doesn't want his daughter
making trouble any more than you do.

20:22.125 --> 20:25.833
Does Mr. Gold know that
his daughter is working as a prostitute?

20:25.833 --> 20:27.166
What?

20:27.166 --> 20:31.291
Mary Jayne Gold's police file
clearly states that she's a prostitute.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.541
An American blonde with a small dog.

20:34.541 --> 20:37.625
I've read the file myself.
She's all over town.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.916
There must be
a misunderstanding.

20:39.916 --> 20:42.458
Miss Gold is an adventurous young woman.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.208
But she's not, you know...

20:44.958 --> 20:47.250
A blonde with a small dog?

20:49.541 --> 20:51.333
Have you seen her recently?

20:52.166 --> 20:53.333
Can't say that I have.

20:55.708 --> 20:57.083
Door closed, please.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.625
Oh, can I help you?

21:12.416 --> 21:16.791
- I was just waiting to see Mr. Patterson.
- Well, he's already in a meeting.

21:17.958 --> 21:21.125
I work with Mr. Varian Fry
at the Emergency Rescue Committee.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.708
But do you have an appointment?

21:24.500 --> 21:27.291
No, um, but I have an urgent message.

21:27.291 --> 21:30.583
It's regarding a visa
issued for the German artist Max Ernst.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.583
Ah, Monsieur Ernst stays in Marseille.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.875
Actually, Mr. Ernst is
throwing a party tonight.

21:37.791 --> 21:39.083
I'd love to meet him.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.458
And ta-da! Ready!

22:31.583 --> 22:34.791
- Whoo!

22:34.791 --> 22:38.541
Whoo! Whoo!

22:40.250 --> 22:42.750
And, um, what about the backstroke?

22:43.875 --> 22:46.541
Well, you gotta keep practicing.
Just a second.

22:46.541 --> 22:49.125
Uh, do you need anything more,
Mr. Patterson?

22:49.125 --> 22:50.958
I'm leaving a bit early tonight.

22:50.958 --> 22:52.041
Something special?

22:52.041 --> 22:57.041
Well, yes, actually. I'm going to a party
at a château called the Villa Air-Bel.

22:57.666 --> 22:58.625
A real château?

22:58.625 --> 23:01.416
All Marseille will be there!
It's Max Ernst's birthday.

23:01.416 --> 23:04.250
Have a good evening.
- Have a good evening.

23:07.666 --> 23:10.750
Uh, no, that means, uh, good evening.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.208
Yeah, Daddy can speak French.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.208
Yes, I can. I just don't like to.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.166
The house looks so beautiful.

23:39.166 --> 23:41.166
You don't look too bad yourself.

23:44.041 --> 23:45.916
How many guests are we expecting tonight?

23:46.625 --> 23:49.500
And there's supposed to be a band?

23:49.500 --> 23:51.958
You realize that
Vichy outlawed jazz music?

23:51.958 --> 23:54.541
If undercover cops come,
we'll all end up in jail.

23:54.541 --> 23:57.916
Varian, it's a party.
Can you even try to have some fun?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.416
Maybe you're right.

24:14.166 --> 24:15.666
Oh, big party!

24:16.166 --> 24:17.041
Oh!

24:18.791 --> 24:20.208
I'm going to dance.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.666
We're going to dance.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.250
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey, we're gonna dance ♪</i>

24:25.875 --> 24:27.875
Tonight's my night, brother.

24:28.541 --> 24:31.166
I can feel it in my bones.

24:32.041 --> 24:35.416
Stamp my feet so hard, they'll feel
the earth rumble back in Ouidah.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.666

24:37.666 --> 24:39.375

25:00.791 --> 25:02.708
Lisa?

25:04.208 --> 25:06.291
I've come to coax you out.

25:06.291 --> 25:07.250
No, thank you.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.125
Rumor is you're quite the dancer.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.250
I'm not in the mood for a party.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.250
Is this about Mr. Benjamin?

25:24.458 --> 25:26.125
Not just Mr. Benjamin.

25:26.750 --> 25:29.208
Nobody in this house has
anything to celebrate.

25:29.708 --> 25:31.291
Max Ernst is alive.

25:32.375 --> 25:35.750
We're all alive. I mean, I think
that's as good a reason as any.

25:36.333 --> 25:39.750
There's no blueprint
for what we're doing here, Lisa.

25:39.750 --> 25:42.041
We're all just trying to do
the best we can.

25:42.541 --> 25:46.375
That's what you tell yourself
so you can sleep at night.

25:47.666 --> 25:49.208
Who said I sleep at night?

26:08.625 --> 26:09.916
Thank you.

26:10.458 --> 26:13.875
Thank you.
Food.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.083
Bravo!

26:20.083 --> 26:22.291
Bravo!

26:28.583 --> 26:31.625
Your Mr. Fry is
full of surprises, isn't he?

26:31.625 --> 26:32.541
Mm.

26:32.541 --> 26:35.833
These refugees
will never want to leave France.

26:36.791 --> 26:40.333
Apparently, there's a painting
by Winston Churchill himself

26:40.333 --> 26:42.416
floating around the Côte d'Azur.

26:42.416 --> 26:44.875
Churchill is a painter?
- Why not?

26:45.708 --> 26:48.833
On the radio, that man sounds very boring.

26:48.833 --> 26:51.375
All painters sound boring on the radio.

26:51.375 --> 26:55.125
Well, not Chagall.
Who is that man?

26:55.125 --> 26:59.583
My husband is
the most beloved artist in France.

26:59.583 --> 27:02.958
Maybe he is, dear Bella,
but Duchamp is the most important.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.500
And Chagall's still a Jew.

27:05.500 --> 27:09.833
With a US visa he refuses to use,
despite my best efforts.

27:11.291 --> 27:12.708
France is my home.

27:13.458 --> 27:17.500
In the end, the Nazis
will come for all of us, Marc. Even you.

27:21.416 --> 27:23.583
Oh. The chicken.

27:23.583 --> 27:24.750
Oh!

27:25.333 --> 27:26.375
Brava!

27:27.750 --> 27:29.291
Thank you, Madame Nouget.

27:29.291 --> 27:30.750
Thank you!

27:33.875 --> 27:36.500
My friend Victor Serge likes to say

27:36.500 --> 27:40.333
among the refugees of fascism
waiting here in exile,

27:41.083 --> 27:46.125
we have enough brilliant minds
to revitalize an entire nation.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.583
Hear, hear.
- Thank you, my friends.

27:48.583 --> 27:52.166
This dark journey
would be unbearable without you.

27:52.833 --> 27:55.416
And Monsieur Fry, for your hospitality

27:56.541 --> 27:59.250
and your deep commitment to our cause,

27:59.916 --> 28:02.333
thank you for being our North Star.

28:03.833 --> 28:06.166
Speech, Varian, speech!
- No.

28:06.166 --> 28:10.208
Speech!

28:10.208 --> 28:11.208
Yes.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.208
Thank you, André.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.041
You honor me greatly.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.083
Uh, when I was young--

28:20.083 --> 28:22.166
- You're still young.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.041
When I was younger, uh,

28:24.666 --> 28:26.333
art was my North Star,

28:27.416 --> 28:29.666
my truest companion,

28:30.583 --> 28:33.083
and my savior in times of

28:34.250 --> 28:36.083
great confusion and pain.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.125
And it is the honor of my life

28:39.625 --> 28:42.166
to return the favor now to artists

28:43.583 --> 28:47.500
and to writers
whose work has given me so much.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.166
So thank you.

28:54.250 --> 28:58.875
Now I suggest that
we all change places for the next course.

28:59.625 --> 29:03.291
- If there is a next course, of course.
Okay!

29:03.291 --> 29:05.375
- Do it.
Let's go.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.541
I'm going to miss you terribly.

29:15.833 --> 29:16.916
Mm.

29:17.875 --> 29:19.458
- Hello.
- Hello.

29:21.416 --> 29:23.750
You and Thomas seem cozy.

29:25.208 --> 29:26.833
- Are you jealous?
- No.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.958
Who's your little date?

29:28.958 --> 29:30.458
None of your business.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.791
- But God damn, huh?

29:34.125 --> 29:35.541
The US consul.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.000
Word gets around.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.333
Word's also gotten around

29:41.333 --> 29:44.791
that you've slept with
every pretty little refugee in Marseille.

29:44.791 --> 29:46.750
So good thing for you

29:46.750 --> 29:50.000
this city is bursting
with desperate women.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.916
A French policeman
today referred to you as a prostitute.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.791
What were you doing
talking to a French policeman?

29:59.791 --> 30:02.541
I'm not gonna apologize
for using every tool at my disposal

30:02.541 --> 30:04.750
to try and save people's lives.

30:04.750 --> 30:05.791
Oh, please.

31:24.291 --> 31:27.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

31:27.500 --> 31:29.166
Ten, nine,

31:29.166 --> 31:31.250
eight, uh, seven...

31:31.250 --> 31:33.000
six, five...

31:33.000 --> 31:34.666
Stop! Stop!

31:35.208 --> 31:36.666
Four, three,

31:36.666 --> 31:38.041
two, one, me!

31:38.041 --> 31:42.208
Happy birthday!

31:42.208 --> 31:43.333
Whoo!

31:54.083 --> 31:54.916
Hey!

31:56.375 --> 31:57.750

Ooh!

33:20.083 --> 33:21.208
Whoo!

33:50.041 --> 33:51.291
What about her?

33:52.333 --> 33:54.583
Too tidy.

33:54.583 --> 33:57.250
- If anything, she works for the Gestapo.

33:58.791 --> 33:59.916
What about him?

34:01.666 --> 34:02.541
Constipated?

34:02.541 --> 34:03.875
I say, um...

34:03.875 --> 34:05.166
National Police.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.125
National Police.

34:08.958 --> 34:11.875
Mary Jayne, which one
of your fancy friends here

34:11.875 --> 34:13.208
is a British spy?

34:15.583 --> 34:16.791
How should I know?

34:17.833 --> 34:18.666
Why?

34:18.666 --> 34:23.333
British intelligence is funding local
resistance cells. I want to start one.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.375
Really?

34:25.375 --> 34:26.458
Count me in.

34:27.166 --> 34:30.625
There's a guy you should meet.
He's a sharpshooter at Camp des Milles.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.458
He's an ally. I'm sure of it.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.583
Maybe I can recruit some here.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.541
What do you know about sharpshooters
and resistance cells?

34:42.291 --> 34:45.625
The British are fighting the Nazis
by themselves. They need help.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.583
- You have to take me home right now.
- Mm.

34:50.375 --> 34:53.208
My boss just arrived.
He cannot see me like this.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.208
Where do you work?

34:54.208 --> 34:57.875
The American consulate.
Consul Patterson is right over there.

34:57.875 --> 35:01.875
- Oh my God. What is he doing here?
Don't act so surprised.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.958
- I didn't invite him.
- No?

35:04.708 --> 35:06.708
What is wrong with you?

35:06.708 --> 35:08.583
I have to get out of here <i>now.</i>

35:09.083 --> 35:10.625
All right, let's go.
- Ugh.

35:10.625 --> 35:11.708
Let's go.

35:13.291 --> 35:14.583
Jesus...

35:23.625 --> 35:25.375
Oh. Hi.

35:29.708 --> 35:32.041
What's a pretty girl like you
doing in a dump like this?

35:40.333 --> 35:41.166
It's, uh...

35:42.166 --> 35:43.791
couture, actually.

35:46.916 --> 35:48.041
Let's get you a drink.

36:19.583 --> 36:21.625
Varian!

36:21.625 --> 36:24.000
- Lena! I was wondering where you were.
Come.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.375
- Look who I found.
Hi. Who is this?

36:26.375 --> 36:27.375
Luise Strauss.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.875
I'm... I'm Varian Fry.
I'm with the Emergency Rescue Committee.

36:31.875 --> 36:35.125
This is amazing.
We have a visa with your name on it.

36:37.625 --> 36:38.625
Oh, oh, oh!

36:38.625 --> 36:40.958
Max?
Excuse me.

36:41.791 --> 36:42.791
Luise.

36:43.458 --> 36:44.958
Are you real?

36:47.166 --> 36:50.041
Don't know.
What are you doing here?

36:50.041 --> 36:53.000
Now you can marry her
and travel to America.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.291
What, right now?

36:55.291 --> 36:58.500
- Once was enough, believe me.
- But you're on the same visa.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.208
No.

37:00.208 --> 37:02.458
You are the mother of my only child,

37:03.750 --> 37:05.125
and I am a man of honor.

37:05.791 --> 37:06.625
You are?

37:07.416 --> 37:08.250
Since when?

37:11.166 --> 37:14.041
Don't worry.
If she doesn't wanna marry you,

37:15.166 --> 37:16.125
I'll do it.

37:18.291 --> 37:19.250
Chin-chin!

37:21.291 --> 37:23.541
Ladies and gentlemen.

37:25.750 --> 37:29.875
At the end of this wonderful evening,

37:29.875 --> 37:32.000
your chance to make a wish.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.416
One wish.

37:37.583 --> 37:41.583
And we will send it out into the universe.

37:44.208 --> 37:46.041
You light your candles...

37:48.791 --> 37:49.791
like me.

37:55.458 --> 37:58.375
And push it gently

37:59.708 --> 38:00.916
into the lake.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.541
What did you wish for?

38:55.375 --> 38:57.166
I wished for this war to end.

39:00.875 --> 39:01.875
Nothing else?

39:03.166 --> 39:04.166
For a cigarette.

39:07.041 --> 39:08.333
You don't smoke.

39:08.333 --> 39:09.333
No?

39:29.125 --> 39:30.708
<i>What did you wish for?</i>

39:31.500 --> 39:33.291
I don't believe in wishes.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.416
If we want something,
we just have to make it happen.

40:04.041 --> 40:06.291
- That dress fits you like a glove.

40:14.458 --> 40:15.416
Hm.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.833
Good night, Lisa Fittko.

40:25.500 --> 40:26.666
I'm sorry. I...

40:27.625 --> 40:29.166
I can't do this again.

40:29.166 --> 40:30.375
What?

40:30.375 --> 40:32.625
Did you know
we were having a party tonight?

40:34.500 --> 40:37.541
- Are you spying on me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

40:44.833 --> 40:45.916
You have to go.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.250
Fucking princess.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.166
<i>Mademoiselle Letoret!</i>

41:44.333 --> 41:45.333
Why are you yelling?

41:45.333 --> 41:47.666
I need to send a wire
to the State Department.

41:47.666 --> 41:51.625
- Okay.
- Uh, keeping an eye on Varian Fry. Stop.

41:51.625 --> 41:54.083
Questionable behavior. Stop.

41:54.083 --> 41:58.625
Is the Emergency Rescue Committee
working against American interests? Stop.

41:59.666 --> 42:03.250
- These people are fucking crazy.
- You want me to put that in the cable?

42:06.750 --> 42:11.000
- How was the party last night?
- Well, I decided not to go.

42:14.125 --> 42:16.791
And then
we come in the front.

42:19.583 --> 42:23.000
And then we say, "Hello, sun."

42:23.750 --> 42:24.583
Oh.

42:25.541 --> 42:26.875
Feel the sun.

42:27.583 --> 42:30.375
And then we do the warrior pose.

42:55.250 --> 42:58.166
Thank you for meeting
me here, where no one can hear us.

43:07.791 --> 43:11.250
These are perfect.
I'll have the passports made.

43:11.958 --> 43:13.291
She's good, this one.

43:14.958 --> 43:15.958
And Varian?

43:16.458 --> 43:18.958
- He can't be involved in this.
- Why not?

43:21.250 --> 43:24.541
- He just can't.
We have a war to win, Thomas.

43:24.541 --> 43:27.875
Varian Fry's already involved,
whether he knows it or not.
