couples friends are a myth,

with tables for four.

04:55.926 --> 04:57.627
I want friends!

04:57.661 --> 04:58.961
Any friends.

04:58.996 --> 05:00.196
Okay, sweetie.

05:00.230 --> 05:01.364
I'll call the Van Houtens.

05:01.398 --> 05:02.965
Not the Van Houtens.
But...

05:03.000 --> 05:05.301
They're always bragging
about their trip to Rome.

05:05.335 --> 05:08.070
It was 12 years ago,

05:08.105 --> 05:09.939

an observation?

05:11.675 --> 05:13.543

no friends.

05:13.577 --> 05:15.278
It's easier to focus,

05:15.312 --> 05:18.881

for whatever art form I choose.

05:18.916 --> 05:21.417

05:21.452 --> 05:22.452

I can imagine

05:27.691 --> 05:29.225

05:29.259 --> 05:30.593
BART:
I can think of worse.

05:30.627 --> 05:32.094
The saddest thing would be

05:32.129 --> 05:33.796
if you were driving
and texting Lisa

05:33.831 --> 05:35.331
and you hit her.

05:35.365 --> 05:38.100

texted before she died was,

05:38.135 --> 05:40.102
"I got your message."

05:40.137 --> 05:41.637
Good night.

05:43.774 --> 05:45.741

make good points.

05:45.776 --> 05:48.978
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the moment of truth

05:49.012 --> 05:50.513
on <i>Topiary Wars.</i>

05:59.356 --> 06:03.893
This Taj Mahal should be

Military History Channel?

06:15.138 --> 06:16.906
We're going to that game party,

06:16.940 --> 06:19.208
and we're going to be
charming and witty.

06:19.243 --> 06:21.210
You're not going to
eat too much,

06:21.245 --> 06:23.613
and we're not going to
stay too late.

06:23.647 --> 06:26.682
MARGE: You will not sing
unless there's a sing-along,

06:26.717 --> 06:30.253
and never take the tray
out of the caterer's hand.

06:30.287 --> 06:32.855
Don't be too loud,
and don't be too quiet.

06:32.890 --> 06:35.791

you get that psycho look.

06:35.826 --> 06:37.026
(jittering)

06:37.060 --> 06:38.594
And stay in the living room.

06:38.629 --> 06:41.564

and watch a basketball game.

06:41.598 --> 06:43.099
Can I check out
what toys they have?

06:43.133 --> 06:44.166
No.

06:44.201 --> 06:45.201
(groans)

06:45.235 --> 06:47.436
Dinner party
at the neighbors'.

06:47.471 --> 06:49.071
At least I can drink.

06:49.106 --> 06:50.473
One drink.

06:50.507 --> 06:53.309
Wha...?!
Walking distance, Marge!

06:53.343 --> 06:56.345
I've been looking forward
to this all week.

06:57.548 --> 06:59.448

this app!

06:59.483 --> 07:00.483

07:03.020 --> 07:05.555
You were charming
enough to win me,

07:05.589 --> 07:08.190
and that day you didn't
have a drink in you.

07:14.298 --> 07:16.465
Marge! Homer!

07:16.500 --> 07:19.001
Mwah! Mwah!

07:19.036 --> 07:20.970
(quietly):

07:21.004 --> 07:24.106
You know, I have more cheeks.
(chuckles)

07:24.141 --> 07:26.409
I'd like you to meet
my wife Wallis.

07:26.443 --> 07:27.843
(deep voice):
How ya doin'?

07:27.878 --> 07:30.713
Wallis has unearthed the most
delightful entertainment

07:30.747 --> 07:32.815
to thrill us for hours on end.

07:32.849 --> 07:36.118
It's a murder mystery,
and we're all suspects.

07:36.153 --> 07:37.520
(crowd gasps)

07:37.554 --> 07:41.357
Great! I've always wanted
to try and solve a crime.

07:41.391 --> 07:42.792
(crowd gasps)

07:42.826 --> 07:45.027
Please, everyone,
read your bio.

07:45.062 --> 07:46.462
(gasps)

07:46.496 --> 07:49.699
I am a humble farmer
from Yorkshire.

07:49.733 --> 07:52.435
Humble I can be!

07:52.469 --> 07:53.970
That's the spirit!

07:54.004 --> 07:56.138
Wallis and I have found
this game to provide

07:56.173 --> 07:58.808
a full evening of
<i>divertissement,</i>

07:58.842 --> 08:01.310
building in suspense
to a masterful climax.

08:01.345 --> 08:02.812
We've rented costumes

08:02.846 --> 08:06.015
you'll find accurate to period
<i>and</i> conducive to character.

08:06.049 --> 08:08.217
We will serve food and wine

08:08.251 --> 08:10.853
appropriate to period
and palette.

08:10.887 --> 08:12.288
(excited murmuring)

08:12.322 --> 08:15.725
We've programmed music
to cover every dramatic event.

08:15.759 --> 08:17.393
Hired a Foley artist.

08:17.427 --> 08:19.228
(steady galloping)

08:19.262 --> 08:21.764
I believe the mare
has a slight limp.

08:21.798 --> 08:23.733
(erratic galloping)

08:23.767 --> 08:25.735
Yes. Yes!

08:25.769 --> 08:30.506
So, for the next three hours,
I welcome you to the moors of...

08:30.540 --> 08:31.641
Question.

08:31.675 --> 08:32.808
Uh, it says here

08:32.842 --> 08:34.477
the murderer is
Admiral Wainsworth.

08:34.510 --> 08:35.578
Who's that?

08:35.611 --> 08:36.879
(crowd groaning, murmuring)

08:36.913 --> 08:39.582
You've... you-you've given away
the game!

08:39.616 --> 08:40.982
Well, you know...

08:41.018 --> 08:42.183
Why you...!

08:42.219 --> 08:43.785
(both grunting)

08:45.789 --> 08:47.723
Thank you so much!

08:47.758 --> 08:51.360
Now Wallis will once again
withdraw into melancholia!

08:51.395 --> 08:53.996
(monotonous):
Birth, school, work, death.

08:54.031 --> 08:56.766
Worth, drool, shirk, breath.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.235
Mirth, cruel, quirk, meth.

08:59.269 --> 09:01.971
Just so you know, mer,
you were going to be

09:02.005 --> 09:04.874
a dashing Russian count
with multiple lovers!

09:04.908 --> 09:07.877
Well, as we
say in Russia,

09:07.911 --> 09:09.412
"Good-bye in Russian!"

09:09.446 --> 09:10.946
<i>Do svidaniya!</i>

09:15.480 --> 09:18.416
Uh, nice night
for a walk.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.550
(sighs)

09:19.585 --> 09:22.987
I'd like to be alone
for a while.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.789
You want to be
more alone?

09:24.823 --> 09:26.123
Yes.

09:30.796 --> 09:32.463
More?
Mm-hmm.

09:35.267 --> 09:36.901
What the...?! D'oh!

09:36.935 --> 09:38.436
(groaning)

09:38.470 --> 09:40.771
That's good.

09:43.175 --> 09:45.443
Okay, I slept on the couch

09:45.477 --> 09:47.478
and I flipped
the sweaty cushions over.

09:47.512 --> 09:49.480
What else can I do?
It's okay.

09:49.514 --> 09:51.816
I mean, those people didn't even
want us at that party

09:51.850 --> 09:53.584
in the first place.

09:53.619 --> 09:57.755
I think it's time we learn
to live with being ostracized.

09:57.789 --> 09:59.156
Mmm...

09:59.191 --> 10:02.326
Don't you dare say
"ostrich eyes"!

10:02.361 --> 10:04.495
Because... uh...

10:04.529 --> 10:05.930
Oh! Oh, okay, okay!

10:05.964 --> 10:07.198
What should we do?

10:07.232 --> 10:08.833
Nothing. I give up.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.701
No more dinner parties.

10:10.736 --> 10:14.038
Our whole social life
will be us watching TV

10:14.072 --> 10:15.873
and you going to Moe's.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.376
I see.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.811
(quietly):
Woo-hoo!

10:20.846 --> 10:21.979
(rattles)

10:23.115 --> 10:26.017
Well, if that's
how you think it has to be.

10:26.051 --> 10:27.551
Yes, for us.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.220
But not for Lisa.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.721
Never for Lisa.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.090
We're going to help
her make friends.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.558
It might be easier with Maggie.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.361
She's always getting letters
from the day care center.

10:37.396 --> 10:38.896
Those are
past-due bills.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.532
They'll get
their blood money.

10:41.566 --> 10:44.902
And Lisa will get a friend.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.904
After this,
we'll do makeovers.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.539
(groans)

10:51.877 --> 10:53.844
So where are
all the friends?

10:53.879 --> 10:55.346
I don't know.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.182
I invited everyone
that Lisa's ever met.

10:58.216 --> 11:00.851
Who are you?
Gus Huebner.

11:00.886 --> 11:04.021
I was on Lisa's coed soccer team
two years ago.

11:04.056 --> 11:06.590
Well, Lisa's gonna be here
in five minutes,

11:06.625 --> 11:09.427
and the only kid who showed up
is Gus freakin' Huebner.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.095
Watch your mouth.
(groans)

11:11.129 --> 11:13.764
Oh, no, you're
right, Homer. Abort!

11:13.799 --> 11:15.366
Abort!
Oh, no.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.202
I was the only chump who
showed up at this train wreck.

11:18.236 --> 11:20.304
Well, I'm not leaving
till I get a party.

11:20.338 --> 11:23.307
Fine, fine. Homer,
give him a party.

11:23.341 --> 11:26.477

theme playing)

11:39.725 --> 11:42.326
(Homer shouts)

11:51.803 --> 11:53.971
Gus Huebner?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.806
Is that you?

11:57.542 --> 11:58.909
(chuckles):
I wish.

11:58.944 --> 12:01.112
That kid can play youth soccer.

12:05.650 --> 12:07.585
Are you guys okay?

12:07.619 --> 12:09.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
I'm fine.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.955
Yeah. That's...
Nothing's going on.

12:10.989 --> 12:12.723
Right, right.
Nothing.

12:12.758 --> 12:13.524
What's for dinner?

12:13.558 --> 12:15.259
Pizza. Mmm.

12:15.293 --> 12:16.527
Lots of pizza.

12:26.805 --> 12:29.707
So, as her teacher, I was
wondering if you could tell me

12:29.741 --> 12:33.177
why Lisa has such
trouble making friends.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.846
Marge, this is
when I normally eat lunch.

12:35.881 --> 12:39.517
So I'll just tell you
Lisa is... unique.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.552
And we're done.

12:46.191 --> 12:47.658
All right. For some reason,

12:47.692 --> 12:50.895
square dancing is a part
of the gym curriculum.

12:50.929 --> 12:53.330
Now, I'm gonna open the divider
to the girls' gym,

12:53.365 --> 12:57.568
and if you don't find a dance
partner within ten seconds,

12:57.602 --> 13:01.672
there is something very wrong
with you!

Aw.

13:19.457 --> 13:21.192
That's tough
luck, Lisa.

13:21.226 --> 13:23.394
Looks like you're dancing

13:23.428 --> 13:25.062
Careful of your toes.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.597
I got me cleats on!

13:26.631 --> 13:28.566
I'll dance
with Lisa.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.168
Tumi? But you're from
the other second grade.

13:31.203 --> 13:33.871

Answer me!

17:16.172 --> 17:19.741
Oh, I wouldn't say I paid
someone to be your friend.

17:19.775 --> 17:22.609
I just gave her money
for records and ice cream.

You gave away ice cream?!

a friend eventually.

your "I'm Sorry" cake,

17:45.768 --> 17:47.068
but, in a way, I'm not.

17:47.103 --> 17:50.505
I guess what I'm trying to say
is I like cake.

17:50.539 --> 17:52.173
Marge, don't feel bad.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.843
You did what any parent
would do.

17:54.877 --> 17:56.911
No, I think
I went too far.

17:56.946 --> 17:58.880
Let me tell you a little story

17:58.914 --> 18:02.584
about a chubby unpopular boy
named Homer.

18:02.618 --> 18:05.120
Is that the boy
you named me after?

18:05.154 --> 18:06.921
It is you,
you idiot!

18:06.956 --> 18:08.323
Whoa.
Little Homer had

18:08.357 --> 18:10.191
a devil of a time
making friends.

18:10.226 --> 18:12.293
No one wanted to come visit him.

18:12.328 --> 18:15.563
<i>So I decided to take matters</i>
<i>into my own hands.</i>

18:15.598 --> 18:17.732
<i>I paid a couple of boys,</i>

18:17.766 --> 18:22.237
<i>Lenny and Carl,</i>
<i>to make my Homer feel loved.</i>

18:22.271 --> 18:25.840
<i>A relationship</i>
<i>I continued to this day.</i>

18:25.875 --> 18:28.376
You pay Lenny and Carl
to be my friends?!

18:28.410 --> 18:31.346
Yes, but Barney's
yours for nothing.

18:31.380 --> 18:32.847
Aw.
Hmm.

18:32.882 --> 18:34.916
Well, that makes me
feel better.

18:34.950 --> 18:36.317

18:36.352 --> 18:37.919

really true?

18:41.490 --> 18:42.790
(laughs)

18:42.825 --> 18:44.626
I wouldn't pay
ten cents to a lion

from eating you!

18:46.529 --> 18:47.529
(groans)

18:50.299 --> 18:53.434
Lisa, just say
something to me.

18:53.469 --> 18:54.936

every psychiatrist

19:09.518 --> 19:12.153

19:12.188 --> 19:15.557
<i>is for Mom to stop crying.</i>

19:15.591 --> 19:17.158
Mom, stop! Stop!

19:17.193 --> 19:20.395
Stop. I'm sorry.

19:20.429 --> 19:21.396
Oh...

19:21.430 --> 19:22.964

19:24.867 --> 19:26.401

19:28.437 --> 19:29.938

19:29.972 --> 19:31.139
It's funny, but...

19:31.173 --> 19:33.975
hurting your feelings
made me feel better.

19:34.009 --> 19:35.910
Mm, try to forget that.

19:35.945 --> 19:38.179
But when I grow up,
I'll find other weird kids,

19:38.214 --> 19:41.449
and we will have the most
intense relationships ever.

19:41.483 --> 19:43.918
And I'll always
love you.

19:43.953 --> 19:45.186
Aw.

19:45.221 --> 19:47.055
Happy Mother's Day.

19:47.089 --> 19:49.724
Mother's Day?!
Mother's Day?! Crap!

19:51.195 --> 19:54.008
Okay, initially I was just
gonna be your friend

19:54.009 --> 19:55.643
till I could
afford a nice belt.

19:55.677 --> 19:57.178
But I like you, Lisa,

19:57.212 --> 19:59.447
and I want to keep
being friends with you.

19:59.481 --> 20:00.982
Great. But from now on,

20:01.016 --> 20:03.718
we have to be totally honest
with each other.

20:03.752 --> 20:05.386
You're absolutely right.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.388
I'm not really a vegetarian.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.123
Have you ever tried horse meat?

20:09.158 --> 20:11.125
