00:02.654 --> 00:05.353
[sneezes]

00:05.440 --> 00:07.833
[growls]

00:07.920 --> 00:09.966
I'’m sorry I'’m keeping you awake.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.142
The antihistamine isn'’t working.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.578
How much did you take?

00:13.665 --> 00:15.667
The recommended dose.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.495
What kind of
alcoholic are you?

00:17.582 --> 00:21.760
Whatever the box
says, triple it.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.328
[groans]

00:24.415 --> 00:27.027
Did you ever think
it would come to this?

00:27.114 --> 00:32.467
Sleeping on a fold-out couch
with a face full of cat ass? No.

00:32.554 --> 00:35.296
We'’ve got
to get our own place.

00:35.383 --> 00:37.907
We can'’t stay
with Marjorie forever.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.910
You sure? We'’re probably
gonna outlive her.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.348
If we dispose of the body
discreetly,

00:44.435 --> 00:46.350
I bet we can hang here
for a couple years.

00:46.437 --> 00:49.875
Maybe even cash her
Social Security checks.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.964
You'’ve really
thought this out.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.097
Well, unlike you, I don'’t
live in the problem.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.056
I live in the solution.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.276
[clinking]

00:59.363 --> 01:01.800
I hope that'’s someone
breaking in to kill us.

01:03.976 --> 01:08.242
Oopsie.

01:08.329 --> 01:11.158
Oh, hello.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.594
You okay?

01:14.422 --> 01:17.555
I am awesome.

01:17.642 --> 01:18.817
Are you drunk?

01:18.904 --> 01:20.515
No.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.736
Please tell me
you didn'’t drive home.

01:24.823 --> 01:27.174
Oh, give me some credit.

01:27.261 --> 01:30.133
[laughing]:
Plus, I couldn'’t find my car.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.397
You mean mycar.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.269
Right.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.880
You are so pretty for your age.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.710
Uh-oh.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.973
Bathroom.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.368
[retching]

01:48.847 --> 01:51.894
Oh, my God,
they'’re eating it!

01:51.981 --> 01:52.938
Oh.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.549
[gagging]

01:54.636 --> 01:56.116
[gagging]

01:56.203 --> 01:57.421
Stop!

01:57.508 --> 02:00.076
Shoo! Go away!
Go away!

02:00.163 --> 02:01.947
Oh, God.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.601
[retching]

02:03.688 --> 02:06.387
[retches]

02:06.474 --> 02:09.041
[retching]

02:11.043 --> 02:13.524
When did I eat corn?

02:15.657 --> 02:16.745
Corn.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.401
[all retching]

02:38.375 --> 02:39.550
[sighs]

02:40.943 --> 02:42.031
You get her down?

02:42.118 --> 02:44.903
Yeah. Had to hose her off first.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.254
Put her on her side?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.517
Just like I used to do with you.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.130
How'’s it going here?

02:54.217 --> 02:56.611
I'’m just counting my blessings.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.569
I'’m at zero.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.572
[sighs]

03:01.659 --> 03:03.922
Violet'’s no angel, but I'’ve
never seen her drunk like this.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.969
Oh, come on. She'’s a kid.
It'’s what they do.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.319
Her mother
and grandmother are alcoholics.

03:09.406 --> 03:10.625
Doesn'’t mean she is.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.192
Doesn'’t mean she isn'’t.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.802
She gave a baby
up for adoption.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.107
Let her have a
freakin'’ drink.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.153
I guess.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.329
I still have
to talk to her about it.

03:19.416 --> 03:22.941
Yeah, teenage girls love a good
heart-to-heart conversation

03:23.028 --> 03:26.118
with their mother.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.120
I wouldn'’t know.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.649
Oh, you'’re good.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.086
Go to sleep.
Oh.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.088
Night.

03:42.265 --> 03:45.181
[sneezes]

03:45.268 --> 03:47.139
[sighs]

03:47.227 --> 03:48.315
[sighs and groans]

03:48.402 --> 03:50.273
Bite me.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.149
All right, kitties,
come get your breakfast.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.804
That'’s odd.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.590
They'’re usually starving
in the morning.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.857
You didn'’t feed '’em anything
last night, did you?

04:08.944 --> 04:10.989
BOTH:
We did not.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.732
Good morning.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.212
How you feeling?

04:16.298 --> 04:17.517
Awful.

04:17.605 --> 04:18.606
Oh. What'’s wrong?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.564
She'’s hungover.

04:20.651 --> 04:23.611
You need to take some aspirin
and drink plenty of fluids.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.526
Christy, let me
handle this.

04:25.613 --> 04:31.009
Sweetheart, the only real cure
for a hangover is to drink more.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.620
Mom, please!

04:32.707 --> 04:35.710
I'’m her grandmother.
I should deny her my wisdom?

04:35.797 --> 04:39.714
No. Just help Roscoe
get to school.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.064
It'’s okay, I got that.

04:42.151 --> 04:45.067
I was trying to get rid of her,
but thanks.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.287
[Christy sighs]

04:47.374 --> 04:49.724
Violet, listen,
I'’m in no position

04:49.811 --> 04:51.682
to judge you
for last night, but...

04:51.769 --> 04:53.380
Then don'’t.

04:55.469 --> 04:59.124
Is it just me, or is she getting
harder to love?

04:59.211 --> 05:02.171
When was she easy to love?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.044
Really?

05:06.131 --> 05:08.090
A bacon cheeseburger?
What?

05:08.177 --> 05:10.222
You just had a heart attack.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.355
There'’s lettuce on it.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.532
So, how'’s our daughter doing?

05:15.619 --> 05:17.186
Broke, homeless, and alcoholic,

05:17.273 --> 05:20.232
but better
than her father'’s arteries.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.539
Is there a plan
for the old landlord?

05:22.626 --> 05:25.063
Is she gonna pay him the money
she owes him?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.543
[laughs]

05:26.630 --> 05:29.329
Oh, you'’re serious.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.635
Yeah, I'’m serious.
She could go to jail.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.507
Oh, please, they don'’t
throw you in jail

05:33.594 --> 05:35.944
for running out
on the rent.
How do you know?

05:36.031 --> 05:37.772
Alvin, unless you'’re talking
a Class A felony,

05:37.859 --> 05:39.556
the worst she'’s looking at is
community service,

05:39.643 --> 05:41.602
picking up trash
on the side of the highway,

05:41.689 --> 05:45.170
which can be actually
quite lovely this time of year.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.303
See, right there,
that'’s the problem.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.913
Aw, man, just '’cause
you can still fit

05:49.000 --> 05:50.524
in your Boy Scout uniform

05:50.611 --> 05:52.308
doesn'’t mean
you have to act like one.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.920
You raised Christy
with no respect for the law,

05:56.007 --> 05:58.183
no appreciation
for right and wrong.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.968
The girl is
a borderline criminal.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.404
Key words there-- Iraised her.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.536
You ran out.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.320
Oh, come on with that.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.930
This guy wasn'’t there
when she was growing up, either.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.324
You'’re gonna blame him
for how she turned out?

06:08.411 --> 06:10.326
Now you'’re just being an idiot.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.328
Am I?
I'’m uncomfortable.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.246
You were her only role model.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.856
Everything she knows
about being a woman

06:18.943 --> 06:20.423
and a mother,
she learned from you.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.252
It'’s a miracle

06:23.339 --> 06:24.949
the two of you never got thrown
in jail together.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.778
It'’s not a miracle.
I run faster than her.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.175
Anyway, I-I can'’t help thinking

06:33.262 --> 06:35.133
that somehow
this is all my fault.

06:35.220 --> 06:38.223
If maybe I had been sober
when my daughter was growing up,

06:38.310 --> 06:40.965
she wouldn'’t be turning tricks
on the street right now.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.838
That'’s it.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.840
I'’m Bonnie. I'’m an alcoholic.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.668
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.887
I'’ve got to tell you, Mary,
I think you'’re right.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.149
I think your daughter'’s
a whore '’cause of you.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.633
I don'’t say that
with any judgment,

06:56.720 --> 06:58.853
because I'’m responsible
for this hot mess over here.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.681
Hey!

07:00.768 --> 07:02.117
Excuse me. I'’m sharing.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.162
This is supposed
to be a safe space.

07:04.249 --> 07:08.253
Oh, my God, how the hell
do you turn my screwups

07:08.340 --> 07:09.690
into your suffering?

07:09.777 --> 07:12.562
The same way Jesus did.

07:14.521 --> 07:18.525
Mom, you really want to take
responsibility for the past,

07:18.612 --> 07:20.048
help me now!

07:20.135 --> 07:21.876
For God'’s sakes,
I'’m homeless.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.530
I'’m sleeping on my
sponsor'’s couch

07:23.617 --> 07:25.836
and feeding her
cats vomit.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.925
What?

07:29.753 --> 07:31.799
Sorry, I forgot you were here.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.151
Get a job.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.544
Make money.

07:37.631 --> 07:38.762
Help us get a home.

07:42.157 --> 07:45.377
You realize I kiss
my cats on the lips.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.652
Well, uh, I must
say, you'’ve had, uh,

07:58.739 --> 08:00.175
quite a smashing
career in advertising.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.829
Thank you.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.744
I like to think I could
sell veal to a vegan.

08:05.572 --> 08:09.314
That'’s not a bad slogan,
you can use that.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.795
So, you did
your postgraduate work

08:11.882 --> 08:13.667
at Southern Methodist
University?

08:13.754 --> 08:15.625
Yep, go Meth or go home.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.326
And you started out writing
ad copy for Ogilvy and Mather?

08:21.413 --> 08:24.112
Loved Ogilvy,
Mather was a little gropey.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.768
Okay.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.857
And then you were
with BBDO in New York?

08:29.944 --> 08:31.815
Yep, I was VP BBDO-NYC.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.991
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.602
[chuckles]

08:37.125 --> 08:38.996
So, why did you leave?

08:39.082 --> 08:40.083
To be completely
honest,

08:40.171 --> 08:41.695
I was bored.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.871
I had knocked it
out of the park so many times

08:43.957 --> 08:45.960
with the food campaigns,
I got pigeon-holed.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.570
I mean, sure, I-I'’m proud of--

08:47.657 --> 08:49.180
"Eggs, they'’re not just
for breakfast anymore,"

08:49.267 --> 08:51.313
but who wouldn'’t be?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.184
Good heavens, that was you?

08:53.271 --> 08:56.492
It was a team, but yeah.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.363
And from there,
I went on to create,

08:58.450 --> 09:00.452
"Beef, it'’s what'’s for dinner."

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
"Pork, the other white meat."

09:02.629 --> 09:06.197
"Got milk?" Which, by the way,
I pitched as a joke.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.199
Fascinating.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.592
So, why did you choose
our agency?

09:09.679 --> 09:11.420
Honestly?

09:11.507 --> 09:12.987
You represent all the big
players in Silicon Valley,

09:13.074 --> 09:14.554
and that'’s the future,

09:14.641 --> 09:16.164
and that'’s what I want
to be part of.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.861
Well, I have to tell you,
Ms. Plunkett,

09:17.948 --> 09:19.907
I am very impressed.Thank you.

09:19.994 --> 09:23.345
You are the most spectacular
liar I have ever met in my life.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.347
Excuse me?

09:27.305 --> 09:30.047
I'’ve been in the ad business
for over 30 years.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.136
Now, you think I don'’t know
who came up with

09:32.223 --> 09:33.877
"They'’re not just
for breakfast anymore"?

09:33.964 --> 09:35.923
I said it was a team.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.882
You are so
pathologically shameless,

09:38.969 --> 09:40.841
I'’m almost tempted to hire you.

09:40.928 --> 09:44.801
Well, as I told Nike,
"Just do it."

09:45.759 --> 09:46.673
Get out.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.544
Thank you for your time.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.072
Hey.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.813
Hey.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.032
What you doing?

09:58.119 --> 09:59.250
Nothing.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.688
You'’re still in your pajamas?

10:01.775 --> 10:02.776
Looks like it.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.693
Okay.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.651
Okay.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.228
We need to talk.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.926
Ah, damn.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.276
I thought
we had a plan.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.844
You were gonna apply
to a local college,

10:27.931 --> 10:31.587
get a part-time job, you know,
get on with your life.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.458
I'’m going to.When?

10:33.545 --> 10:35.156
Back off.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.984
Did you forget what
I just went through?

10:37.071 --> 10:38.681
And do you remember why?

10:38.768 --> 10:40.335
You gave up the baby

10:40.422 --> 10:41.815
so you could make
something of yourself.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.643
I'’m going to my room.Violet.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.080
You'’re a smart girl,
you could do anything.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.648
Yeah, except make you
stop talking.

10:48.735 --> 10:52.347
I swear to God, I am getting
real tired of your attitude.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.044
Seriously?
You'’re gonna lecture me

10:54.131 --> 10:55.959
after you got us
kicked out of our house?

10:56.046 --> 10:59.006
Okay, I may have messed up,
but I'’m still trying.

10:59.093 --> 11:02.052
I am working my ass off
so we can get back on our feet.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.097
You just gave up.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.272
Get out of my way.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.273
Don'’t you!

11:05.360 --> 11:06.753
Hey!

11:06.840 --> 11:09.364
You are messing
with the wrong broad!

11:09.451 --> 11:12.149
[shouting]

11:12.236 --> 11:14.630
Whoa, Roscoe, stay there.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.285
Stop it!

11:17.372 --> 11:19.940
You'’re upsetting
the cats!

11:21.855 --> 11:23.944
What the hell is going on?!

11:25.554 --> 11:27.164
She wants me
to have a great life.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.863
How can I have any kind of life
when I deserted my baby

11:29.950 --> 11:31.691
and I don'’t even know
if she'’s okay?!

11:34.084 --> 11:35.956
Oh, honey.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.961
[whispering]: I never would have
tackled her if I knew.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.748
VIOLET:
I think about her all the time.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.275
I know. I know.

11:52.886 --> 11:56.106
Hey, why don'’t we
go see her?

11:56.193 --> 11:57.586
Really?

11:57.673 --> 12:01.329
The Taylors offered
an open adoption.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.679
That means you can visit
any time you want.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.508
You want me
to call them?

12:08.466 --> 12:09.816
Okay.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.428
Come on, you get washed
and dressed.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.736
Then we'’ll head
right over there.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.520
Okay.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.696
Wait, Violet, I'’ll get you
some clean towels.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.744
[knocking on door]

12:24.831 --> 12:26.702
ROSCOE:
I'’m still out here!

12:29.966 --> 12:30.880
Wow.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.534
Very impressive résumé.

12:32.621 --> 12:33.840
Thank you.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.232
Ever since I was a little girl,

12:35.319 --> 12:38.496
all I wanted to do
was trade stocks.

12:39.976 --> 12:44.372
I used to have
a kitten named Nasdaq.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.895
Cute.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.854
I started young, too.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.943
Sitting on my dad'’s lap,
reading The Wall Street Journal.

12:50.030 --> 12:53.555
Oh, my God, did we grow up
in the same house?

12:53.642 --> 12:55.557
I think we did.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.080
I don'’t know about you,

12:57.167 --> 12:59.604
but I had no interest
in dolls or boys.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.129
All I cared about was IPOs,

13:02.216 --> 13:06.742
currency spreads,
mergers and acquisitions.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.657
Papa used to say,

13:08.744 --> 13:12.443
"Every time a closing bell
rings, an angel gets its wings."

13:12.530 --> 13:15.969
Do you know,
for my tenth birthday,

13:16.056 --> 13:19.233
my dad took me and my friends
to the New York Stock Exchange.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.062
Wow, you had friends.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.586
Until that day.

13:29.069 --> 13:32.942
So, Bonnie, 22 years
at Merrill Lynch.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.944
Why'’d you leave New York?

13:35.031 --> 13:36.816
Can I confide in you, Louanne?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.121
Of course.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.776
I came back to take care
of my daughter.

13:40.863 --> 13:44.127
She'’s... mentally ill.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.695
Oh, dear, I'’m sorry.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.436
Yeah, it'’s been
pretty difficult.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.438
Honestly, I thought
I was gonna retire,

13:50.525 --> 13:53.180
but I need to go back to work
in order to pay for her care.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.877
Sure, sure.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.270
I mean, if she doesn'’t
have 24-7 nursing,

13:56.357 --> 13:57.880
she just tears off her helmet

13:57.967 --> 14:00.143
and runs into the wall
over and over.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.058
Oh, my God.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.930
Well, uh, I would love
to have someone

14:04.017 --> 14:05.540
with your background
come and work with us.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.542
Thank you, Louanne.

14:07.629 --> 14:11.851
Thanks for looking
out for me, Papa.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.941
Now, obviously, we'’re not
a big firm like Merrill,

14:15.028 --> 14:17.160
so we couldn'’t pay you
a base salary

14:17.247 --> 14:18.509
anywhere near
what you'’re used to.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.728
I understand.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.556
What are you thinking?

14:21.643 --> 14:24.428
Well, we couldn'’t go any higher
than $85,000 a year.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.522
Oof.
[laughs uncomfortably]

14:31.609 --> 14:33.916
I'’m not gonna lie,
that'’s quite a drop.

14:34.003 --> 14:37.441
But we have
a great bonus package.

14:37.528 --> 14:40.488
Mm-hmm.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.490
Gosh, I'’m sorry.

14:42.577 --> 14:43.926
I-I don'’t want
to waste your time.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.667
No, wait,
wait, wait.

14:45.754 --> 14:50.280
Uh, what if we were
to, uh, go up to $100,000?

15:02.727 --> 15:05.252
Oh, boy.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.689
You'’re really squeezing
me here, Louanne.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.866
All right, let'’s do this.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.086
That is great.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.870
Huh, you know,
I just realized

15:14.957 --> 15:16.916
that if you were
at Merrill back in the '’90s,

15:17.003 --> 15:18.395
then you had
to know Phil Eldridge.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.093
Phil Eldridge?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.182
Of course!

15:22.269 --> 15:23.748
Who didn'’t know Phil Eldridge?

15:23.835 --> 15:25.098
Guess who'’s running
our bond department?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.317
Phil Eldridge?

15:27.404 --> 15:28.579
You just stay here.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.624
He'’s right across the hall.

15:29.711 --> 15:30.581
I'’m gonna go get him.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.582
Yay.
Yay.

15:34.716 --> 15:38.807
LOUANNE: Phil, you will never
guess who is in my office.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.765
Bonnie Plunkett.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.767
PHIL:
Who?

15:52.429 --> 15:55.084
This is little
Gwyneth'’s room.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.346
Excuse the mess.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.044
It'’s still a work in progress.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.784
Wow.

15:59.871 --> 16:03.571
When I was a baby,
I slept in the shopping cart.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.617
And here she is.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.752
Oh...

16:13.233 --> 16:14.582
She'’s beautiful.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.803
She looks really happy.

16:18.890 --> 16:19.935
Yeah.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.502
I don'’t want to brag,

16:21.589 --> 16:25.419
but, uh, the doctor says
she has perfect poos.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.510
I-I-It...
No.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.862
Do you want
to hold her?

16:33.949 --> 16:36.125
VIOLET:
Uh...

16:36.212 --> 16:38.823
No, that'’s okay.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.304
Can I?

16:41.391 --> 16:42.305
Sure.

16:42.392 --> 16:45.787
Hi, Gwyneth.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.963
Oh, hi.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.923
Aren'’t you a
happy baby?

16:54.187 --> 16:57.712
Thank you so much for letting us
come visit on such short notice.

16:57.799 --> 16:58.669
Anytime.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.976
[whining]

17:03.065 --> 17:04.719
Um...

17:04.806 --> 17:07.026
Sorry, here.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.423
Hey.

17:13.510 --> 17:14.858
What'’s going on?

17:14.945 --> 17:16.383
Nothing, she'’s great.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.906
Everything'’s great.

17:17.992 --> 17:20.996
And that'’s
a good thing, right?

17:21.083 --> 17:23.172
Yeah.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.782
I just don'’t have
any excuses now.

17:25.869 --> 17:27.655
What are you
talking about?

17:27.742 --> 17:30.745
I gave her up so that she
could have this great life.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.790
And she does.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.184
And so that I could
have a great life, too.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.577
And you can.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.971
But what if I can'’t?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.234
What if I fail?

17:41.321 --> 17:44.106
I mean, at least
if I kept her,

17:44.193 --> 17:46.935
I could have been this
miserable single mom like you,

17:47.022 --> 17:49.198
and everyone would
feel sorry for me.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.683
But now I'’m actually gonna
have to do something.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.384
It'’s gonna be okay.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.125
You'’ll see.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.650
Buckle up, Suzanne.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.522
This is what you'’ve got
to look forward to.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.745
BONNIE:
I wouldn'’t work here
even if youdid believe me!

18:18.836 --> 18:20.403
I don'’t get it.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.362
What am I doing wrong?

18:24.929 --> 18:27.367
Come on, God, help me out here.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.759
Give me a sign.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.500
Hey!

18:30.587 --> 18:32.023
Oh.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.024
Okay.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.765
A sign.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.811
Building manager,
building manager.

18:36.898 --> 18:39.770
I think I'’ve got a résumé
in here for that somewhere.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.605
[television playing
indistinctly]

18:52.740 --> 18:55.134
Go eat vomit.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.923
Oh, good,
you'’re home.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.838
Yep.

19:03.925 --> 19:07.102
I'’m home.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.756
I have good news.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.237
You found my real mom?

19:12.934 --> 19:15.110
Yes, she doesn'’t want
to see you.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.507
I got a job.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.510
For money?

19:23.597 --> 19:26.339
Even better.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.951
They'’re paying you in keys?

19:30.038 --> 19:33.389
No, I'’m managing
an apartment building.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.130
They'’re paying me
with a free apartment.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.959
We have a home.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.439
Don'’t mess with me.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.181
Honest to God.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.183
Oh, Mom!

19:44.270 --> 19:45.401
That'’s incredible!

19:45.488 --> 19:47.142
I know!

19:47.229 --> 19:48.883
Wait, wait.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.667
Do you know how to manage
an apartment building?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.060
I do not.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.455
That'’s okay!
Let'’s jump again!
