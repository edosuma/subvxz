00:58.329 --> 00:59.310
You.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.459
You expecting somebody else?

02:18.169 --> 02:21.150
- I've missed that smell.
- Camembert, I believe.

02:22.969 --> 02:25.289
What? No, money.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.539
I like to smell a little money once
in a while.

02:28.969 --> 02:32.590
She's not kidding.  Hide some
and watch her.  It's uncanny.

02:33.169 --> 02:34.400
There he is.

02:46.370 --> 02:50.020
- Mr. Nabbit, hi!
- Oh, hi.

02:51.169 --> 02:52.680
- Glad you could come.
- Thanks.

02:52.969 --> 02:55.069
- Thanks for having us.
- It's a pleasure.

02:56.569 --> 02:57.550
Who are you?

02:59.569 --> 03:02.310
I'm Cordelia Chase.
We spoke on the phone.

03:02.569 --> 03:05.979
Oh, right.  So, you must be Angel?

03:06.770 --> 03:09.539
Nice to meet you.  This is Wesley.

03:10.370 --> 03:12.159
- Lovely party.
- Isn't it nice?

03:13.969 --> 03:15.900
Oh, my God, is that Welling Harding?

03:19.370 --> 03:22.810
I have no idea.  I don't
know most of these people.

03:23.569 --> 03:25.919
I don't even talk to the people.

03:26.569 --> 03:28.639
They come and I think they have fun.

03:28.969 --> 03:31.289
- These are crab.
- If it's a bad time....

03:31.969 --> 03:35.340
Miss Chase said that
you could only meet at night.

03:36.770 --> 03:38.379
It's more convenient.

03:38.569 --> 03:41.310
And we'd be less
conspicuous during the party.

03:43.969 --> 03:46.879
I think it's good.
We won't be interrupted.

03:48.770 --> 03:52.560
I always said I'd make a billion
dollars in the software market...

03:53.569 --> 03:55.360
...and learn to talk to girls.

03:58.969 --> 04:00.370
I'm still working on 2,

04:00.770 --> 04:02.520
Tell us about your case.

04:03.770 --> 04:05.310
My case.

04:09.770 --> 04:12.370
It somewhat has to do with blackmail.

04:13.969 --> 04:16.500
- Go on.
- Familiar with Dungeons and Dragons?

04:16.970 --> 04:17.949
I've seen a few.

04:19.370 --> 04:21.540
- The role-playing game?
- Oh.  Game.

04:23.569 --> 04:24.439
Right.

04:24.769 --> 04:28.100
I used to play a lot in high
school.  It's cool.

04:29.569 --> 04:33.329
You get to be someone else.
A wizard, warrior.  World is magic.

04:34.370 --> 04:37.699
Fighting troglodytes
and romancing demon princesses.

04:38.569 --> 04:39.939
It's a rush.

04:40.970 --> 04:43.069
Did someone find out you
were a nerd?

04:43.970 --> 04:46.220
No, that's public record.

04:47.569 --> 04:51.779
But some of us got really into it.

04:52.970 --> 04:55.220
Especially the demon-romance part.

04:55.370 --> 04:59.870
And then we heard
about this place where the real....

05:02.569 --> 05:05.689
- We joked about getting tail.
- You went to Madam Dorion's.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.529
Just once.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.730
- It's a demon brothel.
- Or twice.

05:12.170 --> 05:15.470
In Bel Air, I believe.
There are many stories about it.

05:16.370 --> 05:18.370
- And how many...
- Twelve times.

05:18.769 --> 05:22.420
- ...people knew about you going?
- Just my friends.

05:24.769 --> 05:27.509
My security guys already
identified the guy with...

05:28.370 --> 05:31.490
...the pictures.
Lenny Edwards.  I can't find him.

05:33.769 --> 05:35.800
We'll see if we can do better.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.230
If my stockholders
see these pictures--

05:39.769 --> 05:42.680
- They won't.
- Don't worry.  We're discreet.

05:43.970 --> 05:47.759
We'll mingle here for a few hours,
so no one suspects.

05:48.769 --> 05:51.120
Hey, David.
Nice to see you.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.750
Nice seeing you again.  Yeah.

05:55.970 --> 05:57.300
I have no idea.

05:58.970 --> 06:01.949
When I moved here
I thought it was all glamour...

06:02.569 --> 06:04.670
...but there's an unseen world.

06:05.569 --> 06:06.439
More than one.

06:46.410 --> 06:47.600
Got him!

06:53.610 --> 06:55.860
Bobby!  Bobby!

07:12.209 --> 07:13.860
No, no, no!

07:15.209 --> 07:16.860
- Dog him.
- Gunn, come on.

07:20.610 --> 07:21.480
Go!

07:24.810 --> 07:26.459
- They're back!
- Open up!

07:28.410 --> 07:29.670
Keep a look out.

07:32.009 --> 07:33.800
Let's get him inside.  Come on.

07:38.610 --> 07:39.980
It's gonna be all right.

07:50.009 --> 07:51.170
Get them in.

08:11.009 --> 08:13.110
I got you.
Just a couple more steps.

08:14.610 --> 08:16.009
You're gonna make it.

08:16.410 --> 08:17.779
Three more.

08:18.209 --> 08:19.750
All right.  Here we go.

08:20.009 --> 08:22.329
Easy, easy.

08:23.610 --> 08:24.980
Yeah. There we go.

08:26.009 --> 08:29.129
- Hey, Gunn.
- Right here, man.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.200
He picked me up like I was a baby.

08:33.808 --> 08:35.840
He's dust, Bobby, forget about him.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.480
- I'm not a baby.
- He needs a doctor.

08:44.610 --> 08:45.980
Not anymore.

08:52.409 --> 08:53.460
James?

08:54.210 --> 08:55.889
How are we fixed for tonight?

08:57.809 --> 09:00.580
We took canned food.
Wasn't much behind Mel's.

09:00.809 --> 09:03.759
We got that.  I told
them we don't take squatters.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.240
Everybody eats.

09:07.409 --> 09:09.230
Okay, you guys are lucky.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.340
We don't do vampires.  Sorry.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.220
- I just came to talk.
- Sorry.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.159
You know Lenny Edwards?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.409
- If I did, I won't tell.
- Discreet, good.

09:45.850 --> 09:46.720
It's essential.

09:47.049 --> 09:50.379
Is it discreet for a client to
be photographed here...

09:51.250 --> 09:52.509
...and then blackmailed?

09:53.049 --> 09:55.330
- What?
- Bad for business, I guess.

09:56.049 --> 10:00.620
If I can find Lenny Edwards, maybe I
can stop it before word gets out.

10:02.049 --> 10:04.889
- Who's the girl?
- Not sure.  The client's David Nabbit.

10:06.850 --> 10:07.929
Lina!

10:15.850 --> 10:17.289
Talk to Lina.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.919
- He's a pretty one.
- He's a vampire, Lina.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.210
Really? We can make an exception.

10:23.649 --> 10:26.740
Just don't do that face thing,
and we'll get along great.

10:29.049 --> 10:31.370
Look, Ma, no hands!

10:37.450 --> 10:39.769
That's not why he's here, Lina.

10:41.649 --> 10:42.809
I'm looking for him.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.750
Your boss wants you to cooperate.

10:55.450 --> 10:56.820
Vampires.

11:03.850 --> 11:05.220
Seen my brother?

11:09.850 --> 11:11.850
- Gunn, we need to talk.
- What up?

11:12.850 --> 11:16.259
- What happened to Bobby?
- Not that.  That's done.

11:17.649 --> 11:19.860
- We're dying, Gunn.
- Everybody dies.

11:20.049 --> 11:22.610
I'm making sure that
when we die we stay dead.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.649
It shouldn't have happened.
You're reckless.

11:26.649 --> 11:29.000
- I do what I have to.
- You do more than that.

11:29.649 --> 11:33.580
Three weeks and no teeth.  You had
to ring the dinner bell like that?

11:34.450 --> 11:37.049
You couldn't go
another day without death.

11:37.450 --> 11:38.850
- I like this?
- You love it.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.809
You won't be happy until you're dead.

11:43.450 --> 11:45.309
- You're wrong.
- Well, I hope so.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.139
Because I don't want to lose you too.

11:55.450 --> 11:57.730
Not gonna happen, little sister.

11:59.049 --> 12:01.789
All right?  It's never gonna happen.

12:05.049 --> 12:06.379
Chain!  You found them?

12:06.850 --> 12:10.220
He led me right to it.
It's close, right around the corner.

12:11.049 --> 12:14.070
- Nice.
- Next to the blue jean factory.

12:14.649 --> 12:16.720
Now we can do some real damage.

12:17.049 --> 12:19.580
Incoming!  Moving fast.
Rooftop to rooftop.

12:20.649 --> 12:22.090
- You were followed?
- No.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.639
Let's check it out.

12:35.649 --> 12:39.129
- What do you want?
- Big question.  What do I want?

12:42.850 --> 12:46.919
Love, family, a place
I can call my own, but you know what?

12:47.649 --> 12:50.350
- What?
- I'll never have any of those things.

12:51.250 --> 12:55.009
Unless things go the way I want
them to, neither are you.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.269
- Where's pictures of David Nabbit?
- Don't know him.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.379
You only get one lie.
I should have told you.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.419
Look, pal, you're
obviously not from around here.

13:13.450 --> 13:16.679
But trust me, you do not
want to see my bad side.

13:17.649 --> 13:20.740
You show me yours, I'll show you mine.

13:21.850 --> 13:25.009
Now I'm from around here.
I'm taking over, understand?

13:26.049 --> 13:30.019
I will dog you every night
until you bring me what I want.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.149
Are we clear?

13:32.049 --> 13:33.519
Yeah, okay. See you tomorrow.

13:40.450 --> 13:44.070
- Vampire is moving in.
- Yeah, he ain't gonna stay too long.

13:48.850 --> 13:51.970
This should take care
of your expenses to date.

13:53.649 --> 13:55.970
I appreciate what
you did at the party.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.899
At the party?

14:00.250 --> 14:01.830
What we did at the party?

14:02.649 --> 14:06.340
- It was a wonderful party.
- We had a good time.  It meant a lot.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.470
You were paying us to be there.

14:11.049 --> 14:14.029
I do that all the time.
You guys actually hung with me.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.259
I'm in charge of the....

14:21.250 --> 14:25.820
- I think there must be some mistake.
- I think Mr. Nabbit can write a check.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.809
No mistake.  I believe
in rewarding good work.

14:31.450 --> 14:35.070
This is generous, Mr. Nabbit,
but we're not finished yet.

14:35.649 --> 14:39.929
It's only money.  And it's David.
You guys call me David, okay?

14:41.049 --> 14:44.740
I like David.
It's such a masculine name.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.110
It feels good in your mouth.

14:50.049 --> 14:52.470
Well, David.
You won't be disappointed.

14:53.049 --> 14:56.309
We'll earn every cent of
your confidence in our firm.

14:57.850 --> 14:58.759
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:59.049 --> 15:01.789
- Feels good in your mouth?
- I was flustered.

15:11.730 --> 15:14.850
- You're a sneaky son of a bitch.
- You have the photos?

15:15.330 --> 15:17.399
Yes.  And a little something extra.

15:22.529 --> 15:23.399
Love that.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.059
Whatever he pays you isn't enough.

16:18.330 --> 16:19.659
Get him!

16:21.330 --> 16:22.909
Come on!  Speed up!

17:34.529 --> 17:36.849
Alonna!  Don't shoot.

17:39.930 --> 17:42.210
- What are you playing at?
- We're not playing.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.470
- You'll get killed.
- You first.

17:46.529 --> 17:47.859
Let's dust him.

17:59.130 --> 18:02.250
For some reason, I think you
don't like me too much.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.019
Maybe I'm just overreacting.

18:11.730 --> 18:13.869
You pretend you're
different from them?

18:14.130 --> 18:16.589
Yeah.  I'll pretend I
just saved her life.

18:21.329 --> 18:24.240
You put a lot of work into this.
Some clever stuff.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.180
I'm impressed.
I have a few suggestions.

18:27.930 --> 18:29.650
- We're not interested.
- Yeah.

18:30.930 --> 18:31.910
You should be.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.579
Who do you think that would've killed?

18:36.329 --> 18:38.680
- We're on the same side.
- Same side of what?

18:39.329 --> 18:41.079
I didn't come here to kill you.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.140
It don't matter why you're here,
or what you are.

18:45.930 --> 18:49.190
If you come here again,
don't count on any long goodbyes.

19:12.569 --> 19:16.359
Nice work.  Nabbit will be greatly
relieved to get these back.

19:19.769 --> 19:21.099
Oh, my.

19:22.170 --> 19:23.539
It's upside down.

19:27.569 --> 19:29.990
Not something you'd have framed.

19:29.970 --> 19:32.849
- How does it feel?
- I can't imagine it's pleasant.

19:35.369 --> 19:36.809
I'm talking to Angel.

19:37.769 --> 19:39.589
Oh, right.  Sorry.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.329
It feels--

19:42.569 --> 19:43.900
It feels better.

19:49.769 --> 19:53.420
- You should rest.  You look--
- Like I've been beaten and stabbed?

19:55.769 --> 19:58.750
- Want to see the check again?
- I want to find those homeless kids.

19:59.369 --> 20:01.190
- They're living together.
- How many?

20:01.769 --> 20:05.029
Six, seven, maybe more.
A couple weren't older than 16.

20:05.970 --> 20:10.539
Twenty minutes' ride from billionaires
and crab puffs, kids going to war.

20:11.369 --> 20:14.490
This isn't something new.
They've been pushed to this.

20:15.569 --> 20:19.710
I understand their stake-first-
ask-questions-later state of mind.

20:21.569 --> 20:22.579
It's how they survive.

20:23.369 --> 20:26.319
And the idea of a vampire
in a white hat...

20:26.970 --> 20:29.950
...probably seems a little
give-me-a-breaky.

20:30.569 --> 20:32.289
They're gonna get killed.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.289
There has to be a nest in the area.

20:35.970 --> 20:38.710
- Find out where the kids live.
- Consider it done.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.000
I'll find the nest before they do.

20:43.170 --> 20:46.609
He'll have to be close, probably
a 10-block area.

20:47.369 --> 20:49.440
It'll have to have sewer access.

20:54.569 --> 20:56.390
Can I see that check again?

20:56.970 --> 20:58.299
Street trash.

20:59.970 --> 21:03.589
That's what they are.
Just stupid, human street trash.

21:05.369 --> 21:08.180
For 70 years we ruled
this neighborhood.

21:08.970 --> 21:10.650
It was our neighborhood.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.859
Decent people used to
live here, working people.

21:14.970 --> 21:19.539
And now? You can't even finish one
without wanting to puke!

21:23.970 --> 21:28.319
And whose fault is it?  Theirs?
I don't think so.

21:29.970 --> 21:32.140
It's our fault.  We let this happen.

21:32.970 --> 21:35.710
We got lazy.  We dropped our guard.

21:39.569 --> 21:42.829
Ty, you ever been
lured into an ambush before?

21:44.369 --> 21:45.740
Of course not.

21:46.769 --> 21:48.910
Ty's been around for as long as me.

21:49.769 --> 21:53.029
He's survived, like me,
because he's smart.

21:55.170 --> 21:56.750
But they did this to him...

21:56.970 --> 22:00.450
...and that means that they could
do it to any one of us.

22:01.769 --> 22:02.819
And why?

22:04.170 --> 22:08.740
Because this street trash
ain't afraid to go for the heart.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.380
And now that's what we're gonna do.

22:18.569 --> 22:21.059
No more picking them off one by one.

22:21.569 --> 22:26.140
We concentrate on the heart.
Take the heart and the rest will fall.

22:29.130 --> 22:29.829
I can't hear it.

22:30.329 --> 22:32.609
- He could be useful.
- Don't listen to her.

22:32.730 --> 22:36.140
There's something different about him.
He knows things we don't.

22:36.930 --> 22:38.960
- He didn't have to do it.
- He would've died.

22:39.329 --> 22:41.960
- Maybe.
- No "maybe."  We'd have killed him.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.549
- Guy bugs me.
- Everyone bugs you.

22:47.130 --> 22:49.269
- You bug me the most.
- What?

22:50.130 --> 22:52.519
I'm trying to keep you alive.
Don't trust him.

22:52.529 --> 22:55.509
If he's not looking
to kill, what's he want?

22:56.130 --> 22:58.549
Why would he come
to a place like this?

23:33.930 --> 23:34.799
Where are they?

23:41.730 --> 23:44.289
- I got some food.
- I'm not hungry.

23:45.329 --> 23:46.700
When did you eat last?

23:47.130 --> 23:49.160
Seems like just yesterday.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.069
- Poe went shopping.
- Alone?

23:51.329 --> 23:53.430
Jason had his back.  They were fine.

23:54.329 --> 23:57.630
- Like last time?
- No cops, no chase.

23:59.130 --> 24:00.390
Come on, you eat this.

24:00.930 --> 24:03.000
They got some other stuff.

24:03.329 --> 24:06.700
Hamburger, and some apples
and lots of other stuff.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.420
We'll have a home-cooked meal.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.089
- What?
- Get everybody out.

24:14.130 --> 24:15.569
- What is it?
- Just do it, go!

24:15.930 --> 24:18.140
Come on, everybody!
Get up!  Get up!

24:21.930 --> 24:25.900
- Get everybody into the daylight.
- Don't they have to be invited?

24:26.130 --> 24:27.390
Chain!

24:27.930 --> 24:29.009
- Cops?
- I don't know.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.900
Are they in? Where are they?

24:32.130 --> 24:33.430
Go, go, go!

24:40.529 --> 24:42.069
I don't see nothing.

24:43.529 --> 24:45.529
- There is nothing.
- Oh, God.

24:50.130 --> 24:51.599
Alonna!

25:15.329 --> 25:17.859
Gunn!  Gunn!

25:35.089 --> 25:39.509
You know?  There's nothing like riding
in a convertible with the top down...

25:40.490 --> 25:43.819
...to make you see the sun and sand.

25:46.490 --> 25:49.859
- Smell that salt air?
- That's not salt.

25:50.690 --> 25:53.670
I don't think it's air either.
But reality's a choice.

25:54.289 --> 25:57.099
You see what you see
and I'll see what I see.

25:59.089 --> 26:01.259
A man in an alley
pushing a shopping cart.

26:01.490 --> 26:06.059
- I see a tan lifeguard-type with--
- No, over there.

26:11.089 --> 26:13.650
These kids have electricity
in their building.

26:14.089 --> 26:16.900
Maybe they tapped a power line
and run it illegally.

26:17.690 --> 26:20.529
If I find the tap, it will
tell us where they are.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.480
Ask this guy if he's seen
our young vampire killers.

26:24.890 --> 26:26.359
I'll check for any taps.

26:26.690 --> 26:29.710
You ask and I'll check for taps?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.559
You can imagine him as
a buff, young stud...

26:33.890 --> 26:36.519
...while I am stuck
with the naked truth.

26:40.490 --> 26:41.359
Ask me in.

26:52.490 --> 26:54.349
You'll get a lot of people killed.

27:00.289 --> 27:01.730
I suck, okay?

27:03.890 --> 27:06.380
- You don't want to be here.
- They want you to go.

27:06.890 --> 27:09.630
I don't need advice
from some dude that's dead.

27:10.490 --> 27:13.190
You have no idea what it's like
down here.

27:14.089 --> 27:16.650
Some of you will die.
Maybe all of you.

27:19.490 --> 27:23.250
People die all the time,
some just for talking too much.

27:26.690 --> 27:28.089
- We're done.
- I can help.

27:30.289 --> 27:32.920
Unless you want to die,
then you're on your own.

27:35.690 --> 27:38.599
- I'm always on my own.
- You don't have to be.

27:39.289 --> 27:40.589
Why not do this together?

27:44.089 --> 27:45.559
You figure it out.

27:47.690 --> 27:48.740
Let's go.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.559
Hold up.  Give me 10 minutes
to check it out.

28:09.289 --> 28:10.690
If you're not back in 10?

28:11.089 --> 28:14.000
Come on down and
kill anything that moves.

29:14.690 --> 29:15.920
Alonna?

29:18.890 --> 29:20.190
Hey, big brother.

29:23.089 --> 29:25.579
- What took you so long?
- Oh, God.

29:26.089 --> 29:27.170
You're not...

29:30.890 --> 29:31.940
...dead.

29:32.089 --> 29:32.890
Well....

29:35.690 --> 29:37.059
No.

29:37.490 --> 29:39.700
Don't be sad.  I'm not.

29:39.890 --> 29:41.710
- They killed you.
- Do I look dead?

29:44.690 --> 29:47.109
I'm stronger, faster
and better than ever.

29:50.089 --> 29:50.960
Want to see?

30:29.529 --> 30:31.279
Right track, but the wrong team.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.769
All that rage and hatred we got?
We'll keep it...

30:35.529 --> 30:39.710
...except on this side
there's no guilt, no grief.

30:40.930 --> 30:43.700
Just the hunt and the kill
and the fun.

30:45.130 --> 30:47.450
How often did we go out
during the day?

30:47.529 --> 30:48.930
Alonna, I can't do this.

30:49.930 --> 30:51.819
You were made for this.

30:54.130 --> 30:56.380
All that misery and moping, gone.

30:57.130 --> 30:59.230
I wasn't gonna let
you get hurt.

31:00.130 --> 31:02.200
I protected you.
You were my sister.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.720
I still am.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.849
So why don't you kill me?

31:09.130 --> 31:10.359
Why don't you?

31:14.529 --> 31:15.970
You can't!

31:16.329 --> 31:18.890
You got the guilt.
I got the best guilt cure.

31:19.329 --> 31:23.049
I can free you.
Our family can stay together...

31:24.730 --> 31:25.990
...forever.

31:40.329 --> 31:41.839
Trying to open that?

31:43.329 --> 31:46.000
- They locked you in?
- No, I love meat lockers.

31:46.930 --> 31:49.319
You should've tried
to call us on your cell phone.

31:52.329 --> 31:54.119
You probably forgot you had it.

31:56.529 --> 31:58.210
Those things hardly ever work.

31:58.930 --> 32:01.980
Besides, it was a lot easier
and quicker to just....

32:02.529 --> 32:06.779
Look, I'm the boss here.  I make
the calls, and I have to go.

32:08.529 --> 32:10.039
You're welcome!

32:12.730 --> 32:16.519
Remember when we were kids in
that shelter on Plummer Street?

32:18.730 --> 32:20.869
Second floor was all rotted out.

32:22.930 --> 32:26.930
You used to dare kids to cross, and of
course you were the best at it...

32:28.930 --> 32:30.609
...because you were the bravest.

32:33.130 --> 32:37.059
I wanted to be like you so bad, so I
went up, and the floor gave out.

32:38.529 --> 32:43.029
I would have broken my neck, but
you'd been watching me the whole time.

32:44.529 --> 32:48.390
You were standing below,
and you caught me.

32:51.130 --> 32:53.230
You've always been
looking out for me.

32:57.130 --> 33:00.680
You don't have to anymore.
It's my turn to look out for you now.

33:01.329 --> 33:02.980
- How?
- Look at you.

33:03.730 --> 33:06.819
You're running, hiding, cold
and hungry.  Is that living?

33:10.930 --> 33:14.549
You're the one falling now.
Let me catch you.

33:15.730 --> 33:17.589
Don't you want to stop falling?

33:21.730 --> 33:23.240
I'm gonna fix it.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.549
Say goodbye to
everything you ever knew.

33:35.529 --> 33:36.759
Goodbye.

33:46.289 --> 33:47.549
Let's get out of here.

33:52.289 --> 33:54.569
What are you waiting on?
How did he get out?

33:55.289 --> 33:57.319
Yo, don't.  We're leaving.

33:57.690 --> 33:59.480
- Leaving?
- I don't think so.

34:07.289 --> 34:10.840
She was so sweet, your sister.

34:11.489 --> 34:14.469
So smooth going down.
If you know what I mean.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.340
You wanted a war?  Well, this is it.

34:21.690 --> 34:24.039
- Here is the deal:  You can go.
- What?

34:25.289 --> 34:28.170
If you go now, and I
never see any of you again...

34:28.889 --> 34:31.030
...you get to live.

34:31.889 --> 34:32.760
Are you high?

34:33.090 --> 34:35.829
L.A. is mine, you'll want
to stay out of it.

34:36.690 --> 34:39.289
These kids, my town,
off-limits from now on.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.239
Who the hell are you?
You know who I am, fool?

34:46.889 --> 34:48.010
The name's Angelus.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.309
I wasn't actually talking to you.

34:52.889 --> 34:56.190
Do we have a truce?
Or do you want to die?

35:00.090 --> 35:02.690
Truce? We can take them.

35:03.690 --> 35:05.230
They'll take some of you.

35:10.289 --> 35:13.840
You came all this way, you're not
gonna kill any vamps?

35:16.289 --> 35:17.519
I already did.

35:48.210 --> 35:52.039
I asked for a coffee.  I know
it must be in here someplace.

35:55.409 --> 35:57.940
Are you all right?
You haven't said a word.

35:58.409 --> 36:00.940
I was just thinking about those kids.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.730
Yes.  That place was pretty awful.

36:04.409 --> 36:06.579
And I thought my
first apartment was bad.

36:07.409 --> 36:09.829
Can you believe
people live there?

36:13.409 --> 36:16.670
It certainly gives one a sense of
perspective, doesn't it?

36:17.010 --> 36:21.579
It does.  And I think,
perspectively speaking...

36:23.010 --> 36:26.909
...I might want to prostitute
myself to billionaire David Nabbit.

36:28.409 --> 36:29.110
Cordelia.

36:30.210 --> 36:34.280
What I mean is, he's a nice
guy who wants companionship.

36:35.010 --> 36:36.269
I could use some security.

36:36.809 --> 36:40.920
- So when I say "prostitute," I mean--
- Prostitute.

36:41.610 --> 36:44.659
- For instance.
- Do you think you could?

36:45.809 --> 36:49.110
I don't know.  I could
probably learn to love him.

36:50.610 --> 36:53.730
Looks aren't everything, or chemistry.

36:54.210 --> 36:58.780
Personality, that's important.
That makes up for a lot of other....

37:02.010 --> 37:04.780
It's not what's
on the outside that....

37:06.809 --> 37:09.480
Yeah. Never mind.

37:10.409 --> 37:11.989
I'm fine here.

37:12.809 --> 37:15.019
Poor, alone.

37:35.010 --> 37:38.309
- What you doing here?
- Skulking, professionally.

37:41.010 --> 37:45.510
I'm glad for what you did, okay?
But I don't need no guardian angel.

37:46.409 --> 37:48.510
It's not gonna change things.

37:48.809 --> 37:51.510
They'll keep coming,
and we'll keep fighting.

37:53.010 --> 37:54.199
I know.

37:56.610 --> 38:01.179
That's it?  You ain't gonna talk
at me, be our daddy figure?

38:02.610 --> 38:05.659
What can I tell you
that you haven't already learned?

38:11.010 --> 38:12.619
- I killed her.
- You didn't.

38:14.610 --> 38:15.550
Near enough.

38:19.409 --> 38:21.369
She was the reason, man.

38:26.610 --> 38:29.730
How come you do it?
How come you're out here?

38:30.210 --> 38:31.929
What else are we gonna do?

38:36.809 --> 38:39.199
- I'll be around.
- I don't need no help.

38:40.409 --> 38:41.920
I might.
