WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.109
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:08.109 --> 00:09.210
I FOUND THIS
IN THE WEIGHT-ROOM TRASH.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.781
A SMALL DOSE CAN
MIMIC FOOD POISONING.

00:10.781 --> 00:12.383
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
IN THERE WITH COLE
THIS MORNING.

00:12.383 --> 00:14.515
GLORIA, I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.518
SHE'D STILL BE HERE IF IT
WEREN'T FOR YOUR DERANGED
MONSTER OF A SON.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.090
I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO
THE SCHOOL BOARD

00:19.090 --> 00:21.122
ABOUT HAVING HIM KICKED
OUT OF GREEN GROVE HIGH.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.723
- IT'S DANNY.
- WHAT ABOUT DANNY?

00:22.723 --> 00:24.225
I THINK THAT
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.157
MAYOR ROLLINS,
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.798
- WHY DON'T YOU HEAD ON HOME?
- YOU TWO HOOKING UP
OR SOMETHING?

00:27.798 --> 00:30.030
NO, SHE'S LIKE...
SHE'S LIKE MY SISTER.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.103
ARCHIE, WE NEED TO TALK.

00:32.103 --> 00:34.505
- I BROKE UP WITH HIM.
- SO VIKRAM HAD A SEPARATE
SECRET ACCOUNT

00:34.505 --> 00:38.038
- IN BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT?
- IT WAS A BUSINESS ACCOUNT FOR
A COMPANY CALLED MARNA, INC.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
- I HAD FUN TONIGHT.
- TOO BAD YOU BLEW IT.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.542
I DID NOT TAKE
THAT NECKLACE
FROM REGINA.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.315
YOU LIED TO US
OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
WE'RE DONE.

00:53.124 --> 00:54.685
READY?

00:56.357 --> 00:58.459
READY AS I'LL EVER BE.

01:07.798 --> 01:09.700
HEY, UH,

01:09.700 --> 01:11.672
THANK YOU, GUYS, FOR COMING.
DO YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?

01:11.672 --> 01:12.743
WE'RE FINE HERE.

01:15.806 --> 01:19.380
OKAY, UM, I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU BOTH

01:19.380 --> 01:22.353
THAT I HAD THE NECKLACE,
OBVIOUSLY.

01:22.353 --> 01:25.316
AND I BETRAYED YOUR TRUST BY
KEEPING SOMETHING SO--

01:25.316 --> 01:28.119
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU DIDN'T KILL REGINA?

01:28.119 --> 01:30.861
LACEY, I DON'T-- I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT.

01:30.861 --> 01:32.693
WHO WOULD LEAVE THE NECKLACE
IN YOUR LOCKER LIKE THAT?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.795
- THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT.
- YEAH, SAYS YOU.

01:36.527 --> 01:38.669
YOU HAD SO MANY CHANCES
TO TELL ME, DANNY.

01:38.669 --> 01:41.472
- IT WAS NEVER A GOOD TIME, JO.
- REALLY?

01:41.472 --> 01:44.435
HOW ABOUT AFTER THE RAID
WHEN WE WERE IN THE DINER?

01:44.435 --> 01:47.208
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE
IF I HAD TOLD YOU THEN?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.780
JO, WOULD YOU HAVE
STUCK BY ME?

01:49.780 --> 01:51.812
WE'LL NEVER KNOW,
WILL WE?

01:54.485 --> 01:57.117
YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO SAY?

01:58.349 --> 01:59.690
I GUESS NOT.

01:59.690 --> 02:03.324
YOU TWO HAVE CLEARLY
ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MINDS.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.297
IT'S JUST
TOO MANY SECRETS, DANNY.

02:28.179 --> 02:31.452
Doug:
UH... UM...

02:32.783 --> 02:34.625
( exhales )
INFINITY?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.188
HOW'D YOU GET THAT VIDEO?

02:37.188 --> 02:39.159
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.392
YOU SENT ME A VIDEO OF
TWO PEOPLE DOING STUFF,

02:41.392 --> 02:43.194
- WITH THEIR BODIES AND LIPS.
- SHHH!

02:43.194 --> 02:45.366
WHO MADE THE VIDEO, DOUG?

02:47.538 --> 02:50.741
OKAY, I...
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHO MADE THAT.

02:50.741 --> 02:53.944
THE PERSON THAT FILMED IT
HAS ASKED FOR THEIR IDENTITY
TO REMAIN A SECRET.

02:53.944 --> 02:56.807
- GOD, IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?
- OH MY GOD, YOU'RE GOOD.

02:56.807 --> 02:58.879
- YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THAT!
- DOUG, THAT'S DISGUSTING!

02:58.879 --> 03:01.852
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT!
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH
MY OWN SHAME, RICO.

03:01.852 --> 03:05.516
OKAY, SO AFTER THE PARTY
I WENT BACK TO DANNY'S PLACE
TO GET ELOISE'S COAT,

03:05.516 --> 03:09.660
AND I SAW DANNY
AND THAT LACEY GIRL
BEING...

03:09.660 --> 03:11.722
YOU KNOW, SEXUAL.

03:11.722 --> 03:15.266
AND THEN
I SAW THAT DANNY MASK
IN THE BUSHES, SO I JUST--

03:15.266 --> 03:17.728
YOU WORE A MASK?!
OF THE GUY YOU WERE FILMING?

03:17.728 --> 03:20.331
ARE YOU TRYING TO BE
THE CREEPIEST GUY
IN THE WORLD?

03:20.331 --> 03:22.773
- NO, IT JUST HAPPENS.
- YOU HAVE TO DELETE THAT VIDEO.

03:22.773 --> 03:25.376
- ( groans )
- HOW WOULD LACEY FEEL
IF THAT GOT OUT?

03:25.376 --> 03:27.938
- AND WHAT ABOUT JO?
- WHY WOULD JO CARE?

03:27.938 --> 03:32.413
NO REASON, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
JUST, LOOK, DELETE THE VIDEO

03:32.413 --> 03:34.915
AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T
GET OUT TO ANYONE ELSE.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.887
- ( sighs )
- GOD, DO YOU KNOW HOW BADLY

03:36.887 --> 03:38.949
YOU VIOLATED THE MATHLETE
CODE OF ETHICS?

03:38.949 --> 03:41.952
- PRETTY SURE THAT'S
JUST ABOUT MATH THOUGH.
- ( groans )

03:46.927 --> 03:48.859
( chatting )

03:53.304 --> 03:55.766
- HEY, COACH, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I CAN'T TALK, DANNY.

03:55.766 --> 03:57.868
I NEVER SHOULD'VE
COVERED FOR YOU.

03:57.868 --> 03:59.940
WHAT-- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.815
I COVERED FOR YOU
AND NOW I'M OUT OF A JOB.

04:04.815 --> 04:06.877
WAIT WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED?

04:06.877 --> 04:10.250
COACH LARSON CAVED.
HE TOLD THE SCHOOL BOARD

04:10.250 --> 04:12.823
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO COLE
AND THAT I KEPT IT QUIET.

04:14.685 --> 04:17.858
SORRY, DANNY,
I COULDN'T COVER
FOR YOU THIS TIME, KID.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.930
GET READY.

04:19.930 --> 04:22.533
YOU'RE IN
FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.500
( theme music playing )

04:34.875 --> 04:36.777
The cover-up that led
to the termination

04:36.777 --> 04:39.810
of Coach Harry Chandler
has put the community of
Green Grove back on edge.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.913
Word has now leaked out that
the player who left the team

04:42.913 --> 04:45.386
immediately after the alleged
poisoning incident

04:45.386 --> 04:47.418
was Danny Desai,
the prime suspect

04:47.418 --> 04:49.860
- in the Regina Crane
murder investig--
- ( TV clicks off )

04:49.860 --> 04:53.494
GOD-- KAREN,
AFTER EVERYTHING SHE'S
GONE THROUGH LATELY.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.566
NOT TO MENTION DANNY.

04:55.566 --> 04:57.628
I HAVE TO SAY
I KINDA FEEL FOR HIM.

04:57.628 --> 04:59.900
SO YOU'RE ASSUMING
HE DIDN'T DO IT?

04:59.900 --> 05:02.903
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
BUT IF THERE WAS
ACTUAL EVIDENCE,

05:02.903 --> 05:05.536
THE FARRELLS WOULD'VE
PRESSED FORMAL CHARGES--
WITH ME.

05:05.536 --> 05:08.979
JUST BECAUSE THERE'S
NO EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S INNOCENT.

05:08.979 --> 05:12.443
HONEY, I KNOW YOU'RE HURT
THAT DANNY LIED ABOUT
HAVING THAT NECKLACE--

05:12.443 --> 05:13.984
I'M SICK OF TALKING
ABOUT THIS, MOM.

05:13.984 --> 05:18.489
JUST...
AT LEAST THINK ABOUT
HOW SCARED HE MUST'VE BEEN

05:18.489 --> 05:20.851
IF IT WAS LEFT
IN HIS LOCKER LIKE THAT.

05:20.851 --> 05:22.593
YEAH, IF.

05:22.593 --> 05:25.426
AND I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE
SO QUICK TO BELIEVE HIM.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.558
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME
FOR WEEKS NOT TO TRUST DANNY.

05:27.558 --> 05:30.631
THERE'S MORE
TO THE REGINA CRANE CASE
NOW THAN JUST DANNY.

05:33.063 --> 05:36.567
WHATEVER.
I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR CHEMISTRY, SO.

05:44.915 --> 05:46.076
HELLO, KAREN.

05:47.117 --> 05:49.950
KAREN, VERY NICE
TO SEE YOU.

05:50.921 --> 05:52.953
I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING
A PRIVATE MEETING, MARK.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.955
I APOLOGIZE, MRS. DESAI.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.928
AS PRESIDENT
AND VICE PRESIDENT
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD,

05:57.928 --> 06:01.462
WE OFTEN FIND IT HELPFUL
TO BE PRESENT

06:01.462 --> 06:03.894
- WHEN DISCUSSING
A STUDENT'S FUTURE HERE.
- HIS FUTURE?

06:03.894 --> 06:06.867
KAREN, PLEASE.
HAVE A SEAT.

06:16.146 --> 06:18.649
IT'S COME TO OUR ATTENTION
THAT DANNY HAS VIOLATED

06:18.649 --> 06:22.883
A STRICT CONDITION
OF HIS CONTINUED ENROLLMENT
HERE AT GREEN GROVE HIGH.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.956
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- AFTER DANNY GOT INTO
A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION

06:25.956 --> 06:29.820
WITH ARCHIE YATES,
PRINCIPAL TANG CONVINCED
THE BOARD NOT TO EXPEL HIM,

06:29.820 --> 06:32.963
ON THE CONDITION HE ATTEND
SCHOOL-SPONSORED THERAPY.

06:32.963 --> 06:35.065
SORRY-- WHICH I DID.

06:35.065 --> 06:37.828
- YOU MISSED A SESSION, DANNY.
- OCTOBER 19th.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.800
- ( snorts )
- WAIT, UM,

06:39.800 --> 06:42.703
THAT'S-- I WAS WORKING
THE MATHLETE BOOTH
AT FALL FEST.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.475
DR. REIDY SAID
THAT WOULD BE OKAY.

06:44.475 --> 06:46.937
NO, DR. REIDY DOESN'T HAVE
THE AUTHORITY TO SAY
THAT IT'S OKAY.

06:46.937 --> 06:49.640
WHY DIDN'T YOU EXPEL HIM
TWO WEEKS AGO THEN?

06:49.640 --> 06:51.912
I MEAN WE ALL KNOW
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

06:51.912 --> 06:53.884
WITH A MISSED
THERAPY SESSION.

06:53.884 --> 06:56.817
IT'S ABOUT THE RIDICULOUS
ACCUSATIONS THAT MY SON

06:56.817 --> 06:58.919
POISONED ANOTHER PLAYER
ON THE SOCCER TEAM.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.991
I WILL ADMIT THAT THE SCANDAL
HAS INTENSIFIED

07:00.991 --> 07:04.525
THE, UH, UNEASE SURROUNDING
DANNY'S PRESENCE HERE.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.426
I-I DIDN'T POISON COLE.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.199
PLEASE. YOU GOTTA
BELIEVE ME.

07:09.199 --> 07:12.603
COACH CHANDLER
AND COACH LARSON TELL
A VERY DIFFERENT STORY.

07:12.603 --> 07:15.836
NOT TO MENTION
COLE FARRELL HIMSELF.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.438
YOU CAN'T JUST EXPEL
DANNY LIKE THIS.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.911
THERE MUST BE SOME SORT
OF RECOURSE HERE.

07:20.911 --> 07:23.974
PRINCIPAL TANG?

07:23.974 --> 07:26.817
ANY, UH...

07:26.817 --> 07:29.880
"RECOURSE" YOU CAN
THINK OF... SIR?

07:30.981 --> 07:32.723
WE COULD HAVE A HEARING.

07:32.723 --> 07:34.585
( scoffs )

07:34.585 --> 07:38.959
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY HEARING?
- THE STUDENT BEING CONSIDERED
FOR EXPULSION

07:38.959 --> 07:42.863
CAN INVITE ANYONE TO ATTEND
AND SPEAK FOR HIM.

07:42.863 --> 07:46.967
AND THE SCHOOL BOARD
CAN ASK PEOPLE TO ATTEND
AND SPEAK AGAINST HIM.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.970
FINE. WE'LL HAVE
THE HEARING QUICKLY--
TOMORROW AFTERNOON

07:49.970 --> 07:53.143
BEFORE THIS TURNS INTO
SOME SORT OF MEDIA CIRCUS.

07:53.143 --> 07:57.578
- DOES THAT WORK
FOR YOU, MRS. DESAI?
- I GUESS IT HAS TO.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.653
- WE'LL SEE YOU ALL TOMORROW.
- I LOOK FORWARD TO IT, KAREN.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.657
( door opens )

08:10.961 --> 08:13.093
THE SOCCER TEAM IS
IN SERIOUS UPHEAVAL.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.527
SCOTT SAYS EVERYONE'S
REALLY LOOKING TO ARCHIE
FOR LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW.

08:16.527 --> 08:18.669
HE'S A GREAT CAPTAIN.
I'M SURE HE'LL GET
THEM THROUGH IT.

08:18.669 --> 08:20.931
SOMEONE'S GUSHING
ABOUT THEIR EX.

08:20.931 --> 08:23.974
IT'S NOT LIKE I BROKE UP
WITH ARCHIE FOR ANY SORT
OF BAD REASON.

08:23.974 --> 08:25.876
- IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT ANYMORE.
- WHATEVER,

08:25.876 --> 08:28.178
I JUST HOPE
THIS IS THE FINAL NAIL
IN THE SOCIO'S COFFIN.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.911
YEAH, ME TOO.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.983
WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING FUN.

08:32.983 --> 08:35.015
GET OUR MINDS OFF
ALL THIS CRAZINESS.

08:37.147 --> 08:39.990
WHAT? WHY IS THAT SUCH
A SHOCKING THING TO SAY?

08:39.990 --> 08:42.122
IT'S NOT,
IT'S JUST...

08:42.122 --> 08:44.995
YOU'VE JUST BEEN
SO ALOOF LATELY.

08:44.995 --> 08:48.098
- I'VE REALLY
FELT IT, LACE, A LOT.
- WHY ARE YOU SITTING WITH US?

08:49.630 --> 08:50.831
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS,

08:50.831 --> 08:53.533
POST-ARCHIE, IT'S BEEN
A LITTLE WEIRD.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.136
WANNA COME OVER TONIGHT?

08:56.136 --> 08:58.268
HANG OUT?

08:58.268 --> 09:00.540
YOU TOO, JANA.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.873
( bell ringing )

09:10.320 --> 09:13.153
COLE, YOU KNOW
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.255
UM, ACTUALLY, I DON'T.

09:17.127 --> 09:20.260
WHEN I CAME TO VISIT YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL, YOU WERE
UPSET I LEFT THE TEAM.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.133
YEAH, THAT WAS BEFORE
I KNEW COACH FOUND MOTHBALLS
IN THE TRASH.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.766
WHY WOULD I POISON YOU?
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.968
- I TOOK YOUR POSITION.
- YOU KNOW I DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT THAT.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.340
YOU WERE MY FRIEND, COLE.
YOU ARE MY FRIEND.

09:31.942 --> 09:34.004
WE BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER.

09:35.345 --> 09:37.948
( chuckles )
THIS IS BECAUSE
OF ARCHIE, ISN'T IT?

09:37.948 --> 09:39.780
HE'S GOTTEN INSIDE
YOUR HEAD ABOUT ME.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.182
COME ON, YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH HE HATED
HAVING ME ON THE TEAM.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.755
SERIOUSLY?

09:44.755 --> 09:46.687
YOU GONNA ACCUSE
MY CAPTAIN NOW?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.989
THAT'S NICE, DESAI.
THAT'S REAL NICE.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.122
Rico:
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HE'D DO THAT?

09:52.122 --> 09:55.165
- POISON SOMEONE
OVER A SOCCER POSITION?
- WHO KNOWS.

09:55.165 --> 09:58.969
- DANNY IS FULL OF SECRETS.
- SO I GUESS YOU'RE
OVER HIM NOW?

09:58.969 --> 10:02.032
TRUST ME, I CAN
BARELY LOOK AT HIM.

10:02.032 --> 10:04.875
JO. HEY, CRAZY DAY, HUH?

10:04.875 --> 10:06.937
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

10:06.937 --> 10:09.880
NO, I'VE BEEN KEEPING
A LOW PROFILE.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.713
- LACE, YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY
MET RICO, HAVE YOU?
- YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.345
- HEY, RICO.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU IN--
IN PERSON.

10:15.345 --> 10:18.849
- IN PERSON?
- WHAT? I MEAN, NOT LIKE I'VE--

10:18.849 --> 10:21.251
I MEAN NOT LIKE
I'VE SEEN YOU NOT IN PERSON
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

10:21.251 --> 10:24.995
IT'S JUST JO'S TALKED ABOUT YOU
AND YOU'VE BECOME LIKE THIS
CONCEPT, THIS IDEA--

10:24.995 --> 10:29.299
AND NOW, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE HUMAN... PERSON
IN PERSON.

10:29.299 --> 10:32.032
SO, UM, I'VE GOT TO GET
TO CLASS, I THINK.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.034
RIGHT, OKAY.

10:34.965 --> 10:38.769
- OKAY, THAT WAS WEIRD.
- NO, THAT WAS RICO.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.641
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
DANNY?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.643
I SAW HIM IN THE HALL.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.946
MANAGED TO ESCAPE
BEFORE HE SPOTTED ME.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.349
( exhales )
I THINK IT MIGHT BE EASIER
IF HE GETS EXPELLED.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.683
ARCH.

10:54.154 --> 10:58.388
LACEY.
HANGING OUT
WITH JO MASTERSON, I SEE.

10:58.388 --> 11:01.161
- NICE TO SEE YOU TOO, ARCHIE.
- IT'S FINE.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.965
JO'S JUST AS FREAKED OUT
BY DANNY AS EVERYONE ELSE.

11:05.996 --> 11:08.068
OKAY, YEAH.
I'M SORRY, JO.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.970
IT'S BEEN A WEIRD
COUPLE OF DAYS.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.202
EVERYONE'S REELING.
YOU KNOW, THE TEAM.

11:12.202 --> 11:14.875
HAS COACH LARSON
STEPPED IN?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.949
YEAH, BUT HE'S NO REPLACEMENT
FOR COACH CHANDLER.

11:18.949 --> 11:21.451
AND I KNOW HE LIED ABOUT
FINDING THAT STUFF
IN THE TRASH,

11:21.451 --> 11:24.054
- BUT I GET IT.
- YOU DO?

11:24.054 --> 11:26.056
WELL YEAH, HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT THE TEAM.

11:26.056 --> 11:29.059
AND, YOU KNOW, WHY MAKE
DANNY'S LIFE HARDER?

11:29.059 --> 11:31.992
BUT YOU STILL THINK DANNY
POISONED COLE, RIGHT?

11:31.992 --> 11:34.895
MAYBE HE DID.
WHO KNOWS?

11:34.895 --> 11:37.297
AFTER EVERYTHING I FEEL
KIND OF BAD FOR THE GUY.

11:37.297 --> 11:41.001
- WEIRD, HUH?
- YEAH. WEIRD.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.103
WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, LACE.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.935
YEAH, YOU TOO.

11:48.378 --> 11:50.881
HE'S BEING REALLY NICE
ABOUT DANNY.

11:50.881 --> 11:52.743
I GUESS.

11:53.944 --> 11:57.047
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT DANNY SAID
THAT NIGHT AT THE CEMETERY?

11:57.047 --> 12:00.320
- ABOUT ARCHIE SETTING HIM UP?
- WHAT, YOU BELIEVE HIM?

12:00.320 --> 12:03.423
WHY WOULD ARCHIE SUDDENLY
CHANGE HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE
ABOUT DANNY NOW?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.998
I KNOW HOW HARD
THIS MUST BE FOR YOU.

12:07.998 --> 12:10.400
YOU STOOD UP FOR DANNY
FROM THE BEGINNING.

12:12.062 --> 12:13.934
BUT YOU HAVE
TO MOVE ON.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.768
YOU JUST HAVE
TO LET HIM GO.

12:27.517 --> 12:28.979
Karen:
I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD GO BACK.

12:28.979 --> 12:31.021
SAYS THE WOMAN TAKING
A PERSONAL DAY FROM WORK.

12:31.021 --> 12:34.054
I'M TRYING TO FOCUS ON TOMORROW.
I'M CALLING EVERY PARENT
AND TEACHER I CAN

12:34.054 --> 12:35.525
UNTIL I FIND PEOPLE
TO SPEAK FOR YOU.

12:35.525 --> 12:37.327
NO ONE'S GONNA SPEAK
FOR ME, MOTHER.

12:37.327 --> 12:39.189
HAVE YOU TRIED TALKING
TO JO AND LACEY AGAIN?

12:39.189 --> 12:42.232
THEY'RE BARELY
SPEAKING TO ME NOW.

12:42.232 --> 12:44.294
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GONNA GET EXPELLED.

12:44.294 --> 12:46.496
I REALLY THOUGHT
I WAS MAKING PROGRESS
AT THAT PLACE.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.338
DON'T GIVE UP.
WE HAVE TO FIGHT.

12:48.338 --> 12:52.242
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO TESS,
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP
GET JO ON BOARD.

12:52.242 --> 12:56.276
I MEAN, IT REALLY HELPED
WHEN SHE STOOD UP FOR YOU
AFTER REGINA DIED, RIGHT?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.208
NOT REALLY.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.952
BUT IT WAS NICE.

13:01.952 --> 13:04.214
WE'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

13:13.824 --> 13:15.926
SO NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME

13:15.926 --> 13:18.298
VIKRAM DESAI HAD A SECRET
COMPANY IN CONNECTICUT?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.901
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS, KYLE.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.133
HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT
APARTMENT IN CONNECTICUT?

13:23.133 --> 13:25.475
OR THE MONEY THAT WAS SENT
TO REGINA FROM THE BANK ACCOUNT

13:25.475 --> 13:27.307
- IN THIS COMPANY'S NAME?
- MMM.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.580
YOU SAID IT WAS CALLED MARNA?
WHAT DID KAREN DESAI HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT IT?

13:30.580 --> 13:33.543
SHE CLAIMS SHE NEVER KNEW
VIKRAM WENT TO CONNECTICUT
FOR BUSINESS.

13:33.543 --> 13:36.346
BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS
I CHECKED THE ONLINE
FILING LOGS,

13:36.346 --> 13:38.889
AND A COMPANY NAMED MARNA
FILED PAPERWORK

13:38.889 --> 13:41.151
FOR A BUILDING PERMIT
TWO YEARS AGO.

13:41.151 --> 13:44.024
AT CITY HALL
HERE IN GREEN GROVE.

13:45.055 --> 13:47.157
AND?

13:47.157 --> 13:50.530
AND WE CAME IN TO PULL
THE ACTUAL FILES,
AND THEY WERE GONE.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.233
MISSING.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.266
- STRANGE, ISN'T IT?
- ( laughs )

13:56.266 --> 14:01.141
COME ON, KYLE, NOW YOU THINK
SOMEONE IN CITY HALL IS HIDING
BUILDING PERMITS? WHY?

14:01.141 --> 14:03.213
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND.

14:03.213 --> 14:05.275
VIKRAM WAS DOING SOMETHING
WITH THIS COMPANY--

14:05.275 --> 14:07.577
SOMETHING HE DIDN'T WANT
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT.

14:07.577 --> 14:10.921
WHO CARES?
VIKRAM IS DEAD.

14:13.523 --> 14:16.156
I KNOW.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.428
THERE MUST BE SOMEONE
COVERING FOR HIM.

14:18.428 --> 14:21.291
SOMEONE WHO YOU THINK
MURDERED REGINA CRANE?

14:21.291 --> 14:23.263
I'M JUST TRYING
TO SOLVE THIS CASE.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.135
WELL, YOU'RE NOT DOING
A VERY GOOD JOB.

14:25.135 --> 14:29.269
THE PRIME SUSPECT
IS OUT THERE POISONING
OTHER STUDENTS.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.441
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT HIM?

14:31.441 --> 14:36.146
JOHN, CAN YOU JUST LOOK
INTO WHAT MIGHT'VE HAPPENED
WITH THOSE FILES, PLEASE?

14:36.146 --> 14:37.607
( sighs )

14:40.150 --> 14:42.382
OKAY, I'LL...

14:42.382 --> 14:44.284
I'LL SEE WHAT
I CAN FIND OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

15:02.302 --> 15:05.105
WOW.
IF LOOKS COULD KILL...

15:05.105 --> 15:07.007
( sighs )

15:07.007 --> 15:09.239
WHAT DO YOU WANT, TYLER?

15:09.239 --> 15:12.142
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING,

15:12.142 --> 15:14.614
SINCE EVERYBODY FOUND OUT
ABOUT THIS POISONING THING.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.617
I'M SURE ALL THIS
WILL MAKE GREAT FODDER
FOR YOUR DOCUMENTARY.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.990
NAH, I KILLED IT.

15:19.990 --> 15:22.492
IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE PARTY.

15:22.492 --> 15:24.924
YOU MEAN WHAT YOU DID
AT THE PARTY.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.326
COME ON.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.299
CAN'T YOU
LET ME OFF THE HOOK?
I'LL TAKE FULL BLAME.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.063
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M ASKING YOU
TO GO OUT WITH ME AGAIN.

15:33.063 --> 15:34.965
I KNOW THAT'S NOT LIKELY.

15:34.965 --> 15:37.207
BUT CAN WE
AT LEAST BE FRIENDLY?

15:37.207 --> 15:39.309
LIFE AT THIS SCHOOL
IS JUST

15:39.309 --> 15:41.311
SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING
WITH YOU IN IT.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.545
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
- THANK YOU.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.049
ALL I ASK.
HOW'S DANNY?

15:49.049 --> 15:51.121
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

15:51.121 --> 15:53.984
SO EVEN YOU'VE
PHASED HIM OUT?

15:56.026 --> 15:58.158
YOU HEAR ABOUT
THE EXPULSION HEARING
TOMORROW?

16:00.190 --> 16:02.232
WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWING
PEOPLE FOR MY MOVIE,

16:02.232 --> 16:04.594
IT WAS SUCH A STRUGGLE

16:04.594 --> 16:07.237
TO FIND ANYONE TO SAY
ANYTHING NICE ABOUT HIM.

16:07.237 --> 16:10.270
AND NOW THERE MIGHT NOT
BE ANYONE LEFT.

16:13.743 --> 16:16.246
Lacey:
COME ON, YOU SO HAVE
A CRUSH ON SCOTT.

16:16.246 --> 16:19.209
OH, SHUT IT.
CAN'T I JUST DISLIKE JANA
FOR HER PERSONALITY?

16:23.113 --> 16:25.655
- HEY.
- TWICE IN ONE DAY.

16:27.317 --> 16:30.590
UM, ARCH, I KNOW IT'S BEEN
WEIRD SINCE WE--

16:32.262 --> 16:34.394
SINCE I ENDED THINGS,

16:34.394 --> 16:36.166
BUT I'D LIKE TO TRY
AND BE FRIENDS.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.198
IF THAT'S COOL WITH YOU.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.231
YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE?

16:42.672 --> 16:44.734
- IT'S-- IT'S POSSIBLE.
- UH, LACEY, HI!

16:44.734 --> 16:46.306
- YOU REMEMBER ME? IT'S--
- RICO.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.778
- RIGHT.
- I KNOW. WE TALKED
LIKE TWO HOURS AGO.

16:48.778 --> 16:50.640
RIGHT, OF COURSE.
UM...

16:50.640 --> 16:53.483
I JUST HAD
A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT...

16:53.483 --> 16:56.746
JO AND HER HAIR.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.152
DON'T MOVE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:02.152 --> 17:03.553
- YEAH, NO.
- OKAY.

17:03.553 --> 17:05.455
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR
HAIR ISSUE.

17:05.455 --> 17:07.597
SWEET, THANKS, MAN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

17:07.597 --> 17:10.130
IT'S JUST-- IT'S PRIVATE.
GIRLS.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.332
UM...

17:12.332 --> 17:14.334
OKAY, WHAT'S--
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

17:14.334 --> 17:17.307
SOMEONE HAS A VIDEO
OF YOU AND DANNY HOOKING UP.

17:17.307 --> 17:18.738
HOLD ON, WHAT?

17:18.738 --> 17:21.341
THIS MATHLETE, DOUG,
FILMED YOU AND DANNY

17:21.341 --> 17:24.244
AFTER THAT PARTY
AT DANNY'S HOUSE
THROUGH A WINDOW,

17:24.244 --> 17:27.177
LIKE, BEING INTIMATE...
PHYSICALLY.

17:27.177 --> 17:30.520
- YEAH, OKAY, I GET IT.
- WELL, ANYWAYS, I TOLD
DOUG TO DELETE IT,

17:30.520 --> 17:32.582
AND HE SAID HE WOULD,
BUT CLEARLY HE DIDN'T

17:32.582 --> 17:36.126
BECAUSE A GUY ON THE DEBATE TEAM
JUST SAID DOUG SHOWED IT
TO HIM A FEW HOURS AGO.

17:36.126 --> 17:37.757
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DID THAT!

17:37.757 --> 17:40.160
- THAT IS SO FREAKING--
- CREEPY, YEAH, I KNOW,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.732
I SHAMED HIM,
BUT CLEARLY IT DIDN'T TAKE.

17:42.732 --> 17:45.695
YOU SHOULD TRY CONFRONTING HIM,
BECAUSE HE'S EXTREMELY
INTIMIDATED BY WOMEN.

17:45.695 --> 17:49.099
UM, NOT THAT INTIMIDATED,
SINCE HE'S AN AMATEUR
PORN DIRECTOR.

17:49.099 --> 17:51.641
- OH NO, HE WAS WEARING A MASK,
SO EVEN IF YOU SAW HIM--
- A MASK?!

17:51.641 --> 17:54.704
- OH MY GOD, WHAT?
- SHOULD I NOT HAVE SAID
THAT PART?

17:54.704 --> 17:57.177
LACEY, I JUST...
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW,

17:57.177 --> 17:59.449
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
IF THIS THING GOT OUT...

18:01.211 --> 18:03.853
IT WOULD BE BAD,
YOU KNOW, FOR-- FOR YOU.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.817
OKAY, SO YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT, RIGHT?

18:07.817 --> 18:10.220
RIGHT, GREAT,
YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT, OKAY.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.122
OKAY.

18:14.524 --> 18:16.366
( doorbell rings )

18:21.301 --> 18:24.103
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:26.276 --> 18:28.238
I DON'T TRUST YOU, DANNY.

18:28.238 --> 18:31.341
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
EVER TRUST YOU AGAIN.

18:31.341 --> 18:33.343
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GET EXPELLED

18:33.343 --> 18:35.285
FOR SOMETHING
THAT YOU DIDN'T DO.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.560
HE SAID
HE FELT BAD FOR ME?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.362
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ARCHIE.

18:52.362 --> 18:54.504
IT WAS STRANGE, PHONY,

18:54.504 --> 18:56.806
SEEMED LIKE HE WAS TRYING
TO COVER SOMETHING.

18:56.806 --> 18:59.539
IF HE DID POISON COLE
TO GET YOU KICKED
OFF THE TEAM,

18:59.539 --> 19:01.511
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY WAY TO PROVE IT?

19:01.511 --> 19:03.543
AT THIS POINT?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.445
PROBABLY NOT.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.777
WHO'S GONNA LISTEN
TO ME, ANYWAY?

19:09.419 --> 19:11.221
MY MOTHER'S RIGHT.
MY BEST CHANCE

19:11.221 --> 19:13.883
IS TO FIND SOME PEOPLE
TO SPEAK FOR ME TOMORROW.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.427
( forced laugh )

19:18.458 --> 19:20.159
WHAT ABOUT TYLER'S MOVIE?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.192
( laughs )
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

19:22.192 --> 19:25.535
HE SAID THAT HE INTERVIEWED
A LOT OF PEOPLE--
BEFORE ALL THIS.

19:25.535 --> 19:27.867
SOME OF THEM SAID
NICE THINGS ABOUT YOU.

19:27.867 --> 19:31.471
HOW CAN YOU HANG OUT
WITH THAT GUY AFTER WHAT
HE DID AT MY PARTY?

19:31.471 --> 19:34.644
WHO I HANG OUT WITH IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
ANYMORE, IS IT?

19:35.845 --> 19:38.648
DANNY, IF HE CAN
EDIT TOGETHER A VIDEO

19:38.648 --> 19:41.180
OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE ON YOUR SIDE,

19:41.180 --> 19:43.453
YOU CAN SHOW IT
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD
TOMORROW.

19:43.453 --> 19:46.456
Kyle:
ME? SPEAK FOR DANNY?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:46.456 --> 19:48.488
I HAD TO ASK.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.361
KAREN'S STRUGGLING
TO FIND PEOPLE.

19:51.361 --> 19:54.394
I TEXTED JO ABOUT IT,
SHE WON'T EVEN
WRITE ME BACK.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.567
BESIDES, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SAID THIS CASE WAS
MORE COMPLICATED NOW.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.969
WELL, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
DANNY'S OFF THE HOOK.

19:59.969 --> 20:03.533
AND IT MAY GET
REAL SIMPLE AGAIN IF I CAN'T
GET MAYOR ROLLINS TO HELP ME.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.605
A VERY SIMPLE,
STRAIGHTFORWARD DEAD END.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.477
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

20:09.539 --> 20:11.811
DID YOU EVER TALK
TO GLORIA CRANE ABOUT
REGINA AND VIKRAM?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.913
I TRIED, BUT IT DIDN'T
GO TOO WELL.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.287
SHE WAS BEYOND INSULTED
THAT I WOULD EVEN SUGGEST

20:17.287 --> 20:20.420
THAT HER DAUGHTER COULD BE
CONNECTED TO A MARRIED MAN,
DENIED THEY EVER MET EACH OTHER.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.922
HEY, I CAN'T
REALLY BLAME HER.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.626
I MEAN, COME ON.
CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF IT WERE JO?

20:26.626 --> 20:29.429
I'D NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING
SORDID LIKE THAT ABOUT HER.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.702
( sighs )
GLORIA MUST BE
IN SO MUCH PAIN.

20:32.702 --> 20:35.735
I KIND OF GET WHY
SHE'S TARGETING DANNY
SO AGGRESSIVELY, YOU KNOW?

20:35.735 --> 20:38.538
CLEARLY, I SHOULD'VE
SENT YOU TO INTERVIEW HER.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.510
MAYBE YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN
THROUGH TO HER FOR ME.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.648
- ( music playing softly )
- ( laughter )

20:48.648 --> 20:51.921
OH MY GOD, I LOVE
JENNIFER LAWRENCE'S
HAIR LIKE THIS.

20:51.921 --> 20:55.285
- IT'S SO STYLISH.
- UGH, I HATE THAT BITCH.

20:55.285 --> 20:56.986
"HUNGER GAMES"
CAN BITE MY ASS.

20:56.986 --> 20:58.758
DID YOU GUYS SEE
"WINTER'S BONE"?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.260
HER FACE WAS, LIKE,
REALLY DIRTY IN IT.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.394
YEAH, BUT SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE, LIKE, SUPER POOR
IN THAT, I THINK.

21:04.394 --> 21:06.566
I MEAN, SHE ATE SQUIRRELS.

21:07.697 --> 21:09.669
LACEY, YOU OKAY?

21:09.669 --> 21:12.041
YEAH, I'M FINE.

21:12.041 --> 21:13.873
- I'M JUST TIRED.
- ( phone vibrates )

21:13.873 --> 21:16.406
- SOMEONE JUST SENT ME
A WEIRD VIDEO.
- ( beeps )

21:16.406 --> 21:17.877
OH MY GOD.

21:20.410 --> 21:24.354
- THAT CAT IS
PLAYING THE HARP!
- ( laughs )

21:24.354 --> 21:26.416
SOMEONE'S EASILY AMUSED.

21:27.457 --> 21:29.419
YOU GUYS, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.566
IF YOU FOUND OUT THAT I DID
SOMETHING BAD--

21:36.566 --> 21:38.828
UPSETTING, DO YOU THINK
YOU'D BE ABLE TO FORGIVE ME?

21:38.828 --> 21:40.600
- OF COURSE.
- LACEY!

21:41.971 --> 21:44.604
THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD DO
TO MAKE ANY OF US HATE YOU.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.876
I'M SURE THERE'S SOMETHING.

21:46.876 --> 21:50.480
THERE'S NOTHING.
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.942
ALWAYS WILL BE.
GOT IT?

21:57.747 --> 22:00.620
Danny Desai?
Yeah, he's okay, I guess.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.623
I almost wet my pants
the first time I was
alone with him,

22:03.623 --> 22:06.426
but after that,
it's been...

22:06.426 --> 22:08.528
all right.

22:09.799 --> 22:12.762
WOW, ALMOST WET HIS PANTS,
BUT DIDN'T.

22:12.762 --> 22:15.405
AFTER HEARING A RAVE REVIEW
LIKE THAT,

22:15.405 --> 22:17.437
THE SCHOOL BOARD
WON'T DARE EXPEL ME.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.570
NO OFFENSE, BUDDY,
BUT THE COMPLIMENTS CAME
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.

22:20.570 --> 22:23.743
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME AWHILE
TO DIG THEM UP, SO WHY DON'T
YOU JUST CHILL OUT, OKAY?

22:25.575 --> 22:28.678
OKAY, COME ON, CAN YOU THINK
OF ANYONE WHO MIGHT'VE SAID
SOMETHING NICE?

22:28.678 --> 22:30.720
THE SOCCER TEAM?

22:30.720 --> 22:33.583
- DANNY, I THOUGHT THEY--
- HATED ME BY THE TIME I LEFT?

22:33.583 --> 22:35.925
PRETTY MUCH,
BUT NOT COLE.

22:35.925 --> 22:39.789
UM, ANY CHANCE YOU
INTERVIEWED COLE FARRELL

22:39.789 --> 22:42.592
- AFTER HE GOT BACK
FROM BEING SICK?
- MAYBE.

22:42.592 --> 22:44.494
- HOLD ON.
- ( rewinding )

22:46.035 --> 22:47.667
HOW MANY INTERVIEWS
DID YOU DO?

22:47.667 --> 22:49.839
YOU NEED TO DO A LOT
TO MAKE A GOOD MOVIE.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.642
- I TOOK THIS THING
REALLY SERIOUSLY.
- I REMEMBER, BELIEVE ME.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.546
OKAY.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.412
HE'S TRYING TO HELP.
COULD YOU AT LEAST BE CORDIAL?

23:02.412 --> 23:03.913
I'M SORRY.

23:03.913 --> 23:07.056
IT'S JUST KINDA HARD
TO BE AROUND HIM AFTER
WHAT HE DID, YOU KNOW?

23:08.958 --> 23:11.561
HARD TO BE AROUND SOMEONE
AFTER THEY'VE HURT YOU--

23:11.561 --> 23:13.693
YEAH, I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THAT FEELS.

23:15.825 --> 23:18.828
I KNOW I DON'T
DESERVE THIS--

23:18.828 --> 23:21.631
YOU, HELPING ME,
BUT I'M GLAD THAT
YOU'RE HERE.

23:21.631 --> 23:24.774
IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I GOT A SHOT.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.738
FOUND IT.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.616
Uh, Danny's a great guy.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.048
He was a real
asset to the team.
It's a shame he quit.

23:39.048 --> 23:41.120
Tyler:
Some other players
have said he was

23:41.120 --> 23:44.754
- the reason you got sick.
- No, that rumor is so bogus.

23:44.754 --> 23:48.558
A lot of the team had
real been nasty to Danny

23:48.558 --> 23:51.601
- ever since he joined.
- Okay, but is is possible

23:51.601 --> 23:55.465
- Danny did that to you?
- I mean, I guess anything's
possible.

23:55.465 --> 23:58.568
But the Danny I know?
He would never do something
like that.

23:58.568 --> 24:00.670
- He's my friend.
- ( taps keyboard )

24:00.670 --> 24:02.812
I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T
A SMEAR PIECE.

24:02.812 --> 24:05.615
DANNY, WE HAVE TO SHOW THIS
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD TOMORROW.

24:05.615 --> 24:07.877
NO.

24:07.877 --> 24:10.620
WE... WE HAVE TO SHOW THIS
TO COLE.

24:17.827 --> 24:19.829
THANKS FOR AGREEING
TO SIT DOWN WITH ME, GLORIA.

24:19.829 --> 24:21.831
I KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY.

24:21.831 --> 24:24.093
- IT'S BEEN A BIT
OF A HECTIC TIME.
- I'M SURE.

24:24.093 --> 24:26.195
FOR COACH CHANDLER

24:26.195 --> 24:29.098
TO HAVE HIDDEN EVIDENCE
THAT A PLAYER MAY HAVE
BEEN POISONED,

24:29.098 --> 24:31.070
IT'S SHOCKING.

24:31.070 --> 24:35.044
FOR SOME BIZARRE REASON
HE SEEMED TO HAVE A SOFT SPOT
FOR THAT DESAI BOY.

24:35.044 --> 24:37.777
RIGHT, BUT

24:37.777 --> 24:40.249
HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK THERE
WAS SOLID EVIDENCE

24:40.249 --> 24:42.682
THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.955
REALLY? THEN WHY
DO YOU THINK HE ASKED
HIM TO LEAVE THE TEAM?

24:48.017 --> 24:50.089
I DON'T KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

24:50.089 --> 24:54.193
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S FAIR TO KICK
HIM OUT OF SCHOOL?

24:54.193 --> 24:56.566
DANNY IS BEING
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL

24:56.566 --> 24:59.228
BECAUSE HE MISSED
A SCHOOL-REQUIRED
THERAPY SESSION.

24:59.228 --> 25:01.531
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT THE REAL REASON.

25:02.832 --> 25:03.903
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT, TESS?

25:04.934 --> 25:06.936
LOOK,

25:06.936 --> 25:09.979
I CAN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE

25:09.979 --> 25:12.011
HOW MUCH PAIN
YOU MUST BE IN.

25:13.983 --> 25:16.215
IF I EVER LOST JO,

25:16.215 --> 25:18.688
I WOULD BE--

25:18.688 --> 25:20.620
( sighs )

25:22.091 --> 25:24.924
BUT, GLORIA,
KAREN IS A MOTHER TOO

25:24.924 --> 25:27.256
AND SHE'S STRUGGLING.

25:27.256 --> 25:30.099
AND I KNOW YOU THINK
DANNY IS RESPONSIBLE

25:30.099 --> 25:32.602
- FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO REGINA--
- I DON'T THINK.

25:32.602 --> 25:35.935
I KNOW. CALL IT
A MOTHER'S INTUITION.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.207
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT BOY IS EXPELLED

25:38.207 --> 25:40.069
AND THEN I WILL MOVE
HEAVEN AND EARTH

25:40.069 --> 25:41.941
UNTIL HE PAYS FOR WHAT
HE DID TO MY DAUGHTER.

25:41.941 --> 25:45.815
KYLE INSISTS THAT THE CASE
IS MORE COMPLICATED NOW--

25:45.815 --> 25:47.847
YOUR HUSBAND IS IN
OVER HIS HEAD.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.549
YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE
COMING TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT DANNY DESAI

25:50.549 --> 25:52.622
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND IS
TOO INCOMPETENT TO ARREST HIM

25:52.622 --> 25:54.754
AND YOUR DAUGHTER FOLLOWS HIM
AROUND LIKE A PUPPY DOG.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.026
DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY DAUGHTER LIKE THAT.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.229
I THINK WE'RE
DONE HERE, TESS.

26:00.229 --> 26:01.891
HAVE A NICE DAY.

26:06.265 --> 26:09.098
I mean, the Danny I know?
He would never do something
like that.

26:09.098 --> 26:10.940
He's my friend.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.942
YEAH, I SAID ALL THIS
BEFORE I KNEW EVERYTHING--

26:12.942 --> 26:16.045
THE COACH'S COVER-UP,
THE MOTHBALLS IN THE TRASH.

26:16.045 --> 26:18.848
COLE, WE WERE
TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME
IN THAT WEIGHT ROOM.

26:18.848 --> 26:21.981
WHEN COULD I HAVE POISONED YOU?
AND WHY WOULD I LEAVE
THE MOTHBALL PACKAGE

26:21.981 --> 26:24.914
RIGHT THERE
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

26:24.914 --> 26:27.086
I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.158
THEY'RE GONNA
EXPEL ME, COLE!

26:29.158 --> 26:32.021
PLEASE.

26:32.021 --> 26:34.293
I NEED YOU TO SPEAK
FOR ME TODAY.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.066
I'M ALREADY SPEAKING
AT THE HEARING.

26:37.066 --> 26:39.198
GLORIA CRANE CALLED ME.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.070
ARCHIE'S SPEAKING TOO.

26:41.070 --> 26:42.932
SHOCKING.

26:42.932 --> 26:45.274
MAYBE WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SHOW
EVERYONE THIS INTERVIEW.

26:45.274 --> 26:48.978
- THE BOARD, ARCHIE.
- ( huffs ) YOU CAN'T.

26:48.978 --> 26:50.379
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT THEN,

26:50.379 --> 26:51.981
I DIDN'T KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT HAD HAPPENED.

26:51.981 --> 26:53.643
YOU'RE NOT GIVING US
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

26:53.643 --> 26:56.245
PLEASE, DON'T.

26:56.245 --> 26:58.387
THIS TEAM MEANS
SO MUCH TO ME.

26:58.387 --> 27:00.750
HOW'S IT GONNA LOOK
IF I'M SEEN DEFENDING HIM

27:00.750 --> 27:03.292
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S IN THE NEWS?

27:03.292 --> 27:05.955
I WAS YOUR FRIEND, OKAY?

27:05.955 --> 27:07.997
I WAS.
AND PEOPLE TURNED
ON ME BECAUSE OF IT.

27:07.997 --> 27:10.700
LOOK, WE GET ALL THAT, COLE,
BUT COME ON...

27:10.700 --> 27:12.161
DANNY SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO BE EXPELLED BECAUSE

27:12.161 --> 27:14.403
YOU'RE AFRAID YOUR TEAMMATES
ARE GONNA BE MAD AT YOU.

27:14.403 --> 27:15.935
WE'RE NOT GONNA
SHOW THE VIDEO.

27:20.069 --> 27:22.341
LOOK, SAY WHATEVER YOU HAVE
TO SAY

27:22.341 --> 27:24.674
TO THE BOARD TODAY.
OKAY?

27:24.674 --> 27:26.045
I GET IT.

27:33.182 --> 27:35.124
WHY'D YOU LET HIM
OFF THE HOOK?

27:37.887 --> 27:40.389
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BE
AN OUTSIDER ON THAT TEAM.

27:40.389 --> 27:42.932
AND I DON'T WANNA
PRESSURE COLE

27:42.932 --> 27:44.864
INTO DOING ANYTHING
THAT'S GONNA HURT HIM.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.166
- BUT NOW YOU'RE GONNA BE--
- EXPELLED?

27:48.237 --> 27:49.839
MAYBE, WE'LL SEE.

28:02.852 --> 28:04.683
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TALK TO DOUG?

28:04.683 --> 28:07.987
- I DECIDED NOT TO.
- LACEY, NOW HE'S SENDING IT
OUT TO PEOPLE!

28:07.987 --> 28:10.820
I EVEN HEARD
A FEW CHESS CLUB GUYS
TALKING ABOUT IT.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.462
- I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
CONFRONTING THAT CREEP DOUG.
- LACEY, HE--

28:13.462 --> 28:15.424
IF IT MAKES IT TO MY FRIENDS,
THEN SO BE IT.

28:15.424 --> 28:17.326
THEY'LL BE MAD,
BUT THEY'LL FORGIVE ME.

28:17.326 --> 28:18.998
YEAH, BUT JO MIGHT NOT!

28:18.998 --> 28:21.030
JO? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

28:21.030 --> 28:24.033
OF COURSE SHE WILL.
I MEAN, IT'LL BE WEIRD,

28:24.033 --> 28:26.035
- BUT SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.
- NO NO, SHE WON'T!

28:26.035 --> 28:28.137
OKAY?
SHE'S IN LOVE WITH DANNY!
OKAY? I KNOW!

28:28.137 --> 28:30.039
SHE TOLD ME
SHE LOVES HIM,
LIKE, A LOT.

28:33.112 --> 28:33.983
OKAY.

28:36.345 --> 28:37.917
BUT NOT ANYMORE, RIGHT?

28:39.288 --> 28:42.451
- AFTER DANNY LIED TO US ABOUT--
- NO, SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T.

28:42.451 --> 28:45.995
I KNOW JO REALLY WELL
AND I KNOW SHE'S LYING.
SHE'S STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

28:45.995 --> 28:49.028
LACEY, IF SHE FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU AND DANNY...

28:49.028 --> 28:51.931
- IF SHE SEES THAT VIDEO...
- SHE'S NOT GONNA SEE IT.

28:53.062 --> 28:55.064
TAKE ME TO DOUG.

29:01.911 --> 29:04.013
( chatting )

29:13.222 --> 29:14.984
JO, YOU CAME.

29:14.984 --> 29:17.827
- ARE YOU-- ?
- SHE JUST SIGNED UP TO SPEAK.

29:17.827 --> 29:20.159
I CAN'T TAKE ANY CREDIT
FOR CONVINCING HER THOUGH.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.134
- THANK YOU.
- I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

29:38.848 --> 29:42.251
- SO I HEARD
YOU'RE SPEAKING TODAY.
- YEAH.

29:42.251 --> 29:45.084
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.
IT'S JUST WHEN
THE SCHOOL BOARD CALLS,

29:45.084 --> 29:47.116
YOU KNOW,
YOU ANSWER IT.

29:47.116 --> 29:50.319
Bruce:
ALL RIGHT THEN, WE WILL NOW
HEAR WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY,

29:50.319 --> 29:53.492
AND THEN MAKE
AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT
WHETHER TO GIVE MR. DESAI

29:53.492 --> 29:57.026
A SECOND CHANCE,
DESPITE HIS RECENT INFRACTION.

29:57.026 --> 30:00.830
UP FIRST IS ARCHIE YATES.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.533
( sighs )

30:07.236 --> 30:11.010
MR. YATES, YOU PLAYED
SOCCER WITH MR. DESAI.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.142
WHAT WAS
YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE?

30:13.142 --> 30:16.045
UH, WELL,

30:16.045 --> 30:19.188
HE WAS A REALLY
GOOD SOCCER PLAYER.
HELPED THE TEAM.

30:19.188 --> 30:21.490
TO BE HONEST,
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING AGAINST THE GUY.

30:23.452 --> 30:25.594
IT WAS JUST HARD--
FOR THE TEAM.

30:25.594 --> 30:27.456
PLEASE EXPLAIN.

30:27.456 --> 30:29.999
HE WAS...

30:29.999 --> 30:32.461
DIFFICULT.
I MEAN,

30:32.461 --> 30:35.865
THE GUYS WERE ALL
FREAKED OUT BY HIM.

30:35.865 --> 30:38.938
I MEAN, I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT WE WERE ALL KIND OF
RELIEVED WHEN HE QUIT.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.072
I'M SORRY.
ALLEGEDLY QUIT.

30:43.072 --> 30:45.945
YOU HAD A PHYSICAL
CONFRONTATION WITH MR. DESAI.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.177
- TELL US ABOUT THAT.
- OH, TO BE HONEST...

30:50.119 --> 30:52.051
IT WAS PRETTY SCARY.

30:54.523 --> 30:56.555
THE LOOK IN HIS EYES
WHEN HE PUNCHED ME,

30:56.555 --> 30:58.888
IT WAS INTENSE.

30:58.888 --> 31:01.190
I STILL THINK
ABOUT IT SOMETIMES.

31:01.190 --> 31:04.233
OKAY, THANK YOU,
MR. YATES.

31:05.494 --> 31:06.565
YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR.

31:13.943 --> 31:16.045
Bruce:
THANK YOU, MR. STEVENS.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.207
I'M SORRY HAVING
MR. DESAI IN YOUR CLASS

31:18.207 --> 31:20.409
MADE TEACHING
MORE STRESSFUL.

31:23.612 --> 31:26.355
NEXT UP WE HAVE
COLE FARRELL.

31:36.265 --> 31:39.128
MR. FARRELL, TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH MR. DESAI.

31:40.129 --> 31:42.531
I LIKED DANNY.

31:44.573 --> 31:46.905
I STILL LIKE DANNY.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.377
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

31:48.377 --> 31:51.180
- ( crowd murmuring )
- A GOOD GUY?

31:51.180 --> 31:52.942
YOU DO CONTEND

31:52.942 --> 31:55.614
THAT DANNY DESAI
WAS THE ONLY PERSON

31:55.614 --> 31:57.586
IN THE WEIGHT ROOM THAT DAY
YOU GOT SICK?

31:57.586 --> 31:58.687
PLEASE, GLORIA.

32:00.089 --> 32:02.921
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING
DANNY DIDN'T DO IT.

32:04.153 --> 32:06.195
I MEAN, I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

32:06.195 --> 32:08.027
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

32:12.601 --> 32:14.103
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

32:20.609 --> 32:22.471
IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE, RIGHT?

32:23.472 --> 32:24.643
I'LL TAKE IT.

32:27.276 --> 32:30.149
I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I WISH I COULD TAKE IT ALL BACK,

32:30.149 --> 32:32.551
- BUT IT JUST HAPPENED.
- JUST HAPPENED?

32:32.551 --> 32:35.624
HOW DO YOU "JUST HAPPEN"
TO PUT ON A MASK AND FILM
TWO PEOPLE HOOKING UP?

32:35.624 --> 32:38.027
- THAT'S A REALLY
SMART QUESTION.
- ( clicking )

32:38.027 --> 32:40.689
- DOUG, YOU SAID
YOU'D GET RID OF IT.
- I KNOW, BUT...

32:40.689 --> 32:43.492
SUDDENLY I HAD THIS THING
THAT PEOPLE WANTED

32:43.492 --> 32:46.195
AND IT MADE ME FEEL
SO, YOU KNOW, AWESOME.

32:46.195 --> 32:49.498
LOOK, THE CHESS CLUB GUYS
WANNA HANG OUT WITH ME!

32:49.498 --> 32:52.971
THEY ARE, LIKE,
REALLY CHOOSY, SOCIALLY.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.974
ALL RIGHT, DOUG, LET ME
EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN HERE.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.746
YOU'RE GONNA DELETE THAT VIDEO
FROM YOUR PHONE.

32:57.746 --> 33:00.309
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE A LIST OF EVERYONE
THAT YOU SENT IT TO

33:00.309 --> 33:02.251
AND YOU'RE GONNA DELETE IT
FROM THEIR PHONES,

33:02.251 --> 33:04.183
AND THEIR DESKTOPS,
AND THEIR LAPTOPS.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.415
OH MY GOD,
WILL YOU PLEASE STOP
CLICKING THAT RETAINER?

33:09.358 --> 33:10.759
YEAH, I CAN DO
ALL THOSE THINGS.

33:10.759 --> 33:13.692
GOOD. AND IF YOU DON'T
IT'LL BE MY MISSION

33:13.692 --> 33:16.765
TO MAKE THE REST OF YOUR
HIGH-SCHOOL EXPERIENCE
HURT, BADLY.

33:16.765 --> 33:19.368
THE SAME WAY CERTAIN PEOPLE MAY
BE HURT IF THEY SAW THAT VIDEO.

33:19.368 --> 33:22.201
- GOT IT?
- YEAH.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.133
- GO.
- OH, RIGHT.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.481
WOW, THAT WAS HARDCORE.

33:34.243 --> 33:37.246
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE YELLED AT ELOISE
LIKE THAT THOUGH.

33:37.246 --> 33:39.318
SHE DOESN'T FORGET.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.220
SHE DOESN'T FORGET.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.751
( groans )

33:42.751 --> 33:45.654
I KNOW IT'S EASY
TO CONDEMN DANNY.

33:47.756 --> 33:49.658
I KNOW HE'S MADE
SOME MISTAKES,

33:51.600 --> 33:55.404
BUT I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND
HOW HARD HE'S TRYING
TO START OVER.

33:57.666 --> 34:01.039
SO PLEASE, GIVE HIM
ONE MORE CHANCE.

34:02.111 --> 34:03.672
THANK YOU.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.447
MRS. MASTERSON,
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.480
EXCUSE ME, BRUCE,
BUT DOES THIS BOARD

34:11.480 --> 34:13.552
REALLY BELIEVE THAT
IT'S APPROPRIATE

34:13.552 --> 34:15.454
FOR THE WIFE
OF OUR CHIEF OF POLICE

34:15.454 --> 34:18.487
TO DEFEND THE PRIME SUSPECT
IN MY DAUGHTER'S MURDER
INVESTIGATION?

34:18.487 --> 34:21.130
I COULD ASK
THE SAME QUESTION, GLORIA.

34:21.130 --> 34:24.193
HOW IS IT APPROPRIATE
THAT YOU TO HAVE ANY SAY

34:24.193 --> 34:26.095
IN DANNY DESAI'S FUTURE
AT THIS SCHOOL?

34:26.095 --> 34:29.138
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU TOLD ME
OVER BREAKFAST TODAY

34:29.138 --> 34:32.141
- THAT IT WAS YOUR MISSION
TO GET HIM KICKED OUT?
- NO, I NEVER SAID THAT!

34:32.141 --> 34:35.644
- YES, YOU DID.
- DANNY DESAI IS A THREAT
TO EVERY PARENT HERE.

34:35.644 --> 34:38.647
HOW CAN YOU STAND THERE,
DEFENDING A SERIAL KILLER?

34:38.647 --> 34:41.780
DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY SON THAT WAY!

34:41.780 --> 34:44.082
- KAREN, DON'T.
- MRS. DESAI, PLEASE.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.684
MRS. MASTERSON HAS
THE FLOOR NOW.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.617
- IT'S JUST MY OPINION, KAREN.
- SCREW YOU!

34:48.617 --> 34:51.790
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GIVE MY OPINION OF YOUR CHILD
AND CALL HER WHAT SHE WAS--

34:51.790 --> 34:53.592
- A WHORE?
- ( crowd gasps )

34:58.697 --> 35:02.671
- SIT DOWN.
- OKAY, EVERYONE
CALM DOWN PLEASE.

35:02.671 --> 35:04.833
JUST CALM DOWN.

35:06.635 --> 35:10.108
OKAY, LAST ONE
TO SPEAK IS JO MASTERSON.

35:19.748 --> 35:22.791
MS. MASTERSON, TELL US
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

35:22.791 --> 35:25.594
- TO DANNY DESAI.
- WELL, IT'S, UM...

35:25.594 --> 35:28.727
IT'S COMPLICATED.

35:30.459 --> 35:32.201
BUT I KNOW HE'S
A GOOD PERSON.

35:32.201 --> 35:35.334
OKAY, CAN YOU
ELABORATE ON THAT?

35:37.706 --> 35:40.769
( sighs )
I CAN'T. I JUST...

35:40.769 --> 35:42.811
I KNOW IT.

35:42.811 --> 35:45.614
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
SINCE HE GOT BACK.

35:45.614 --> 35:47.776
IT HASN'T
ALL BEEN EASY.

35:47.776 --> 35:50.779
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"IT HASN'T BEEN EASY"?

35:52.381 --> 35:54.853
TO BELIEVE IN HIM,
TO TRUST HIM.

35:56.785 --> 35:59.358
BUT IN THE END I CAN'T
TURN AWAY FROM HIM.

35:59.358 --> 36:03.592
WHY, JO?
EXPLAIN TO US WHY
YOU CAN'T TURN AWAY FROM HIM?

36:03.592 --> 36:05.634
I WISH I COULD.

36:06.695 --> 36:09.198
IT WOULD BE

36:09.198 --> 36:11.900
A LOT EASIER
FOR ME IF I COULD.

36:11.900 --> 36:15.604
TO MOVE ON FROM HIM,
TO LET HIM GO.

36:15.604 --> 36:17.646
BUT HE'S JUST...

36:18.947 --> 36:21.650
THE MOST AMAZING PERSON.

36:23.512 --> 36:26.815
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I FEEL LIKE...

36:30.759 --> 36:32.861
WHEN I'M WITH HIM,
I JUST FEEL SO...

36:34.623 --> 36:37.526
I MEAN, HOW COULD
HE BE THIS BAD PERSON,
IF I'M FALLING--

36:37.526 --> 36:39.728
( murmuring )

36:45.234 --> 36:47.976
OKAY, THANK YOU
SO MUCH, JO.

36:47.976 --> 36:49.738
YOU MAY SIT DOWN.

37:16.004 --> 37:17.906
HEY.

37:19.908 --> 37:21.470
HEY.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.973
- SO WHEN DO YOU HEAR?
- COULD BE ANY MINUTE.

37:24.973 --> 37:27.376
ANY HOUR.

37:27.376 --> 37:30.279
I GUESS IT DEPENDS
ON HOW LONG IT TAKES
FOR THEM TO RECOVER

37:30.279 --> 37:32.651
FROM MY MOTHER CALLING
REGINA CRANE A WHORE.

37:32.651 --> 37:36.024
YEAH, PROBABLY WON'T GO
IN THE PLUS COLUMN.

37:36.024 --> 37:38.287
PROBABLY NOT.

37:38.287 --> 37:40.629
JO, ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID--

37:40.629 --> 37:42.491
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

37:42.491 --> 37:44.693
I WAS JUST--

37:44.693 --> 37:46.895
I REALLY WANTED TO HELP.

37:46.895 --> 37:48.997
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THAT CRAP
WITH ARCHIE

37:48.997 --> 37:51.700
AND GLORIA? I MEAN
I WAS PRETTY REVVED UP.

37:53.642 --> 37:56.305
RIGHT.
WELL, UM...

37:56.305 --> 37:57.476
THANK YOU.

38:00.609 --> 38:02.611
JO, WHAT WE HAVE...

38:04.813 --> 38:07.316
OUR RELATIONSHIP--

38:07.316 --> 38:09.758
IT'S VERY SPECIAL.

38:10.959 --> 38:13.522
AND...

38:13.522 --> 38:15.724
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD DO WITHOUT IT.

38:16.725 --> 38:18.327
OKAY?

38:19.928 --> 38:22.070
TEXT WHEN YOU HEAR, OKAY?

38:22.070 --> 38:24.072
I WILL.

38:31.039 --> 38:33.011
HEY, CHIEF MASTERSON!

38:33.011 --> 38:35.984
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
OUR CONVERSATION THE OTHER DAY,

38:35.984 --> 38:39.388
AND YOU WERE RIGHT--
IT IS TIME FOR ME TO STEP UP
AND HELP YOU OUT.

38:39.388 --> 38:42.421
THIS IS MARILYN ROSSI.
MARILYN, I WANT YOU TO MEET

38:42.421 --> 38:44.923
CHIEF OF POLICE
KYLE MASTERSON.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.695
- GREAT TO MEET YOU, CHIEF.
- MS. ROSSI.

38:46.695 --> 38:48.957
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT, JOHN?
- IT'S ABOUT MARILYN.

38:48.957 --> 38:51.460
SHE'S A TOP-NOTCH
INVESTIGATOR,
CURRENTLY WORKING

38:51.460 --> 38:53.732
FOR A WELL-RESPECTED
PRIVATE FIRM.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.564
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE MY CREDENTIALS?

38:55.564 --> 38:57.766
NO THANKS,
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

38:57.766 --> 39:01.339
- I DON'T GET WHAT'S GOING ON.
- WELL, IT SEEMS THE CRANE
INVESTIGATION

39:01.339 --> 39:02.871
HAS GONE A LITTLE OFF COURSE

39:02.871 --> 39:05.544
AND I THINK MARILYN HERE
CAN REALLY HELP US OUT.

39:05.544 --> 39:08.076
- YOU DON'T HAVE
THE AUTHORITY TO--
- ACTUALLY I DO!

39:08.076 --> 39:10.849
I SPOKE TO ALBANY.
THEY'RE FULLY ON BOARD.

39:10.849 --> 39:14.022
THEY'RE NOT REALLY LOVING
THE BAD P.R. GREEN GROVE
HAS BEEN GETTING

39:14.022 --> 39:17.456
AND THEY WANT
TO SEE THIS CASE SOLVED
ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

39:17.456 --> 39:20.659
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
I CAN PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.461
WE'LL GET ALONG GREAT.

39:22.461 --> 39:25.994
NOW YOU GO SOLVE
THIS THING, YOU TWO!

39:29.498 --> 39:31.039
LET'S START
AT THE BEGINNING.

39:31.039 --> 39:32.941
WALK ME THROUGH
THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME

39:32.941 --> 39:35.574
AND SHOW ME EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE ON DANNY DESAI.

39:38.507 --> 39:40.479
JO, HEY.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.950
HEY.

39:41.950 --> 39:43.952
I HEARD ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID
AT THE SCHOOL BOARD.

39:43.952 --> 39:47.556
I GET IT, YOU KNOW?
WHY YOU STOOD UP
FOR DANNY LIKE THAT.

39:47.556 --> 39:49.588
IT'S HARD TO LET GO.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.060
YEAH...

39:52.060 --> 39:54.623
ESPECIALLY SINCE
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

39:54.623 --> 39:57.896
- OH, WOW. JO, I--
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PRETEND, LACEY.

39:57.896 --> 40:01.129
I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS,
AFTER THE WAY I ACTED
AT THE HEARING.

40:01.129 --> 40:02.971
EVEN DANNY PROBABLY KNOWS.

40:05.974 --> 40:09.107
- I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.
- I-- I GET WHY YOU DIDN'T.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.480
YOU THOUGHT IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN WEIRD, RIGHT?

40:11.480 --> 40:13.582
THE THREE OF US
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP?

40:13.582 --> 40:14.643
YEAH.

40:16.485 --> 40:18.987
PLUS I KNOW
THAT HE DOESN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

40:18.987 --> 40:22.120
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T?
- I JUST KNOW.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.994
BUT EVEN IF HE DID...

40:27.656 --> 40:29.628
I HOPE YOU KNOW I NEVER
WOULD'VE DATED HIM

40:29.628 --> 40:32.030
WITHOUT TALKING
TO YOU FIRST.

40:32.030 --> 40:35.003
I CARE ABOUT YOU
SO MUCH, LACEY.

40:35.003 --> 40:37.466
ABOUT US.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.109
I CARE ABOUT US TOO.

40:41.109 --> 40:42.671
WANNA...?

40:47.876 --> 40:51.650
I WANNA THANK YOU BOTH
FOR BEING SO PATIENT THROUGH
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.051
- I KNOW--
- CUT TO THE CHASE, MARK.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.957
DANNY, I'M SO SORRY.

41:00.989 --> 41:04.092
THE SCHOOL BOARD HAS DECIDED
TO UPHOLD THE EXPULSION.

41:05.994 --> 41:08.667
I TRIED, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE I CAN DO.
