00:01.120 --> 00:03.170
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

00:03.170 --> 00:04.580
I've been waiting.

00:04.580 --> 00:07.380
I wanted to come with you,
meet my sister.

00:07.380 --> 00:08.580
You know, Sibyl told me
all about her --

00:11.710 --> 00:13.250
May: John Garrett's here
with Nathaniel,

00:13.250 --> 00:14.380
and they have
Gordon's powers.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.380
Stay back.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.420
If he's not here for Jiaying,
what's he after?

00:20.420 --> 00:21.620
Sousa, shoot him!

00:24.460 --> 00:26.880
They took Simmons.
May, where are we going?

00:26.880 --> 00:28.580
May: We're not going anywhere.
You are.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.290
The Zephyr's been hijacked.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.960
Why am I here?
My pal Sibyl
ran the numbers,

00:32.960 --> 00:35.120
and every outcome
where we don't come out on top

00:35.120 --> 00:36.670
has one thing in common.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.540
Fitz.
And now you're gonna
take us to him.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.580
What the hell just happened?

01:11.580 --> 01:14.460
They disappeared.
Dropped off satellite.

01:14.460 --> 01:15.920
Did they jump? I thought
the Time Drive wasn't working.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.210
They didn't jump.
How do you know?

01:17.210 --> 01:19.120
They didn't jump.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.830
Okay, how do you
drop off satellite?

01:21.830 --> 01:23.000
Don't they surround
the planet?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.210
You move above them.

01:26.710 --> 01:29.500
Daisy, I can feel your guilt.
This isn't your fault.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.710
I should've quaked
that psychopath's bones apart

01:31.710 --> 01:33.120
when I had the chance.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.460
Yo-Yo: 616 requesting
permission to land.

01:35.460 --> 01:36.880
You're clear, 616.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.380
They have Kora.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.170
Maybe she'll have
answers.

01:41.420 --> 01:43.540
We can't tell her
about Jiaying's death.

01:43.540 --> 01:45.000
She should know
what her boyfriend did.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.380
Kora's not stable.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.460
Hearing that her mother died
might set her off.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.460
If she's a bomb, then
what's the plan if she explodes?

01:50.460 --> 01:51.880
Leave that to me.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.540
I won't make the same mistake
I made with Nathaniel.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.120
The potential Inhumans
are safe.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.790
We dropped them
at a hospital,

02:08.790 --> 02:10.880
made sure they're being
taken care of.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.830
You must be Daisy --

02:13.670 --> 02:14.790
Where did they take
Simmons?

02:16.580 --> 02:19.000
Daisy, that's enough!
Not until she talks!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.040
Put her down, Agent Johnson!
That's an order.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.580
Look, there's no reason
to hurt each other.

02:34.580 --> 02:35.710
I'm here to help.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.540
How, exactly?

02:38.540 --> 02:40.710
Save lives, of course.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.920
I want to be
an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.670
50,000 miles above Earth
and rising, sir.

03:10.670 --> 03:12.880
Should be a killer view.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
And lay off the "sir."

03:15.960 --> 03:18.170
We're trying to make it
so no one has to call
anyone "sir" ever again.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.330
Send the signal.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.830
S.H.I.E.L.D.
can't follow us?

03:22.830 --> 03:26.290
Not at this range.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.580
We're all alone up here.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.830
Just like Nakatomi Plaza.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.670
Yipee-ki-yay?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.750
I'm staying posted
right here.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.750
Who knows what other powers
they stole.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.000
And with Garrett
being able to teleport...

04:09.000 --> 04:10.380
Mack: When we confronted
the older Gordon,

04:10.380 --> 04:12.830
Fitz designed a device
to trap him in a room.

04:12.830 --> 04:15.460
Now, if we can find Fitz's specs
on this hard drive,

04:15.460 --> 04:16.790
we should be able to
rig something up.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.920
Until then,

04:18.920 --> 04:21.330
I'm your new babysitter.

04:24.620 --> 04:27.710
We know that there's
some strategy at play here

04:27.710 --> 04:30.290
because Sibyl's been
predicting our every move.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.330
Exactly. These guys put up
a fight, but Kora...

04:33.330 --> 04:35.620
That was too easy,
I know.

04:35.620 --> 04:39.290
But now she's selling us
this story of compliance.

04:39.290 --> 04:42.420
We may be predictable,

04:42.420 --> 04:44.460
but so is the enemy,

04:44.460 --> 04:47.210
because they're always
planning to ruin our day.

04:47.210 --> 04:49.880
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.670
I'm a perfect candidate,

04:51.670 --> 04:54.120
with the perfect instrument
to save lives.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.580
Didn't seem like
it was your priority

04:55.580 --> 04:56.830
when you were
attacking Li.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.620
I killed him...to be clear.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.830
During his last-ditch effort
to do the same to me.

05:01.830 --> 05:04.040
How do we know that's not
Malick's plan with Simmons?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.290
Where are they?

05:05.290 --> 05:06.920
Out of reach.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.040
But our goal is to reduce
suffering, believe me.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.500
I've suffered plenty
at his hands.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.670
What do you mean
"instrument"?

05:13.670 --> 05:16.380
Knowledge of history
yet to be written.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.960
Lives have already
been spared with it.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.500
My own.
Agent Daniel Sousa.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.620
Those two soldiers
you just locked in a cell.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.580
Not all lives were saved.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.500
Some were taken.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.290
I'm sorry
about your parents.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.210
They didn't deserve
to die.

05:34.210 --> 05:37.500
But it's also
the proof you needed.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.120
Proof?

05:41.210 --> 05:43.500
You must realize it
by now.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.120
Proof that this is
a new timeline.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.500
He gets it.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.580
That old one that you
were fighting to preserve

05:50.580 --> 05:52.710
is long gone.

05:52.710 --> 05:56.080
Director, you still remember
growing up with your parents.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.290
Daisy grew up without a sister
because I died alone weeks ago.

06:00.290 --> 06:02.210
Yet here we are.

06:02.210 --> 06:04.710
We have much more definitive
proof than that.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.500
It's a brand-new day.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.170
Why not let S.H.I.E.L.D.
make this universe

06:08.170 --> 06:09.380
the best it can be?

06:09.380 --> 06:11.500
And how do you plan
on doing that?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.210
Killing.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.750
Yeah, I'm not sure
you understand

06:15.750 --> 06:17.460
the S.H.I.E.L.D.
motto here, lady.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.670
It's not your motto,
it's your method.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.170
Do you want me to list
the people you've chosen to kill

06:22.170 --> 06:23.750
to protect others?

06:23.750 --> 06:25.120
Coulson:
There's no need.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.040
We've all made
hard choices.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.170
Then another list,
of easy choices.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.580
30 names
we can kill right now

06:33.580 --> 06:36.040
to save thousands
of innocent lives.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.420
It sounds like Project Insight
with a fancy new bow on it.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.120
These are names you know --
history knows --

06:41.120 --> 06:44.790
committed unspeakable acts.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.210
We're not a death squad.

06:46.210 --> 06:49.500
Well, Sibyl predicted
you'd say that.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.080
And that Daisy would say --

06:51.080 --> 06:53.040
Let me talk
to my sister alone.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.380
I'd like nothing more.

07:12.580 --> 07:14.290
Why are you really here?

07:14.290 --> 07:16.710
I thought
I just explained --
We're not morons.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.830
Despite whatever Nathaniel
has told you.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.120
Nathaniel thinks
S.H.I.E.L.D. is

07:20.120 --> 07:22.420
another institution
hell-bent on control.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.460
And maybe in an old timeline
it was, but...

07:25.460 --> 07:27.710
I believe there's a chance
we could work together.

07:27.710 --> 07:29.000
What makes you think
that we would ever --

07:29.000 --> 07:30.580
You.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.960
I've always wanted a sibling,

07:38.960 --> 07:42.290
and we have the same blood.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.880
You believe
in S.H.I.E.L.D.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.580
There must be a reason.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.250
You grew up in Afterlife.

08:08.290 --> 08:11.500
I wasn't aware
I was confined.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.420
I thought I had
a happy childhood.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.080
Didn't you?

08:18.080 --> 08:21.380
Every child
loves her mother.

08:21.380 --> 08:24.040
Not every mother
loves her back.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.960
I'm sorry
you didn't get that.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.540
I'm sorry
you threw it away.

08:32.540 --> 08:38.000
I just want to spend time
together, to talk.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.670
With you and me
on the same page,

08:41.670 --> 08:43.670
we can do anything.

08:45.380 --> 08:49.080
What, like a --
like a sister superhero squad?

08:50.250 --> 08:53.960
Sibyl said
there is no future

08:53.960 --> 08:56.790
where Daisy Johnson
lets her sister fight alone.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.670
She was right.

09:30.620 --> 09:35.460
I like to think about the first
law of thermodynamics...

09:35.460 --> 09:37.580
That no energy in the universe
is created --

09:37.580 --> 09:40.250
And none is destroyed.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.790
That means that every bit
of energy inside us,

09:44.790 --> 09:47.210
every particle,

09:47.210 --> 09:49.120
will go on to be
a part of something else --

09:51.670 --> 09:55.420
As much as I would love to
watch you leave Fitz catatonic,

09:55.420 --> 09:57.830
I need you to show me
where he is now.

09:59.670 --> 10:02.960
I miss you.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.210
I'm here.

10:05.210 --> 10:06.580
Together. We're --

10:06.580 --> 10:08.170
Professional,
and matter of fact,

10:08.170 --> 10:10.000
and there's this chasm
in the middle of the room

10:10.000 --> 10:12.620
of all these things
of --

10:12.620 --> 10:15.330
I'm supposed to be able to see
whatever memory I want.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.500
You are blocking me.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.420
How?

10:18.420 --> 10:20.250
I'm not doing anything.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.500
Maybe it's you.

10:23.040 --> 10:23.920
Maybe you're not
equipped to --

10:26.460 --> 10:29.170
Tell me how.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.210
John,
bring in the grandson.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.250
Deke? He's here?

10:46.250 --> 10:47.960
And trying to play hero.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.670
He doesn't know anything,
please, you can't --

10:55.290 --> 10:58.710
Hi, Nana.
How's your day been?

11:11.250 --> 11:12.960
Hey,
I was just coming to...

11:12.960 --> 11:15.750
That's...different.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.330
Going somewhere?

11:17.330 --> 11:20.210
Look, I know that you want to
help, believe me, I know.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.330
But just for once,
don't, okay?

11:22.330 --> 11:24.040
If you're chasing a lead
and you need backup --

11:24.040 --> 11:25.380
I have to do this
on my own.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.000
You know, I learned
a long time ago

11:28.000 --> 11:30.210
not to let somebody do
something stupid on their own.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.620
You learned that
in the Army?

11:33.620 --> 11:35.210
Brooklyn Scout Troop 87.

11:35.210 --> 11:36.670
Boy Scouts.

11:36.670 --> 11:38.670
We were kinda the bad boys
of the Boy Scouts.

11:41.710 --> 11:44.250
Have you ever left your post
before?

11:45.210 --> 11:47.830
Like snuck off the base
and, I don't know,

11:47.830 --> 11:49.210
played pool
and got drunk?

11:51.080 --> 11:52.880
You think I'm the kind of person
that would do that?

11:54.290 --> 11:56.710
Then this'll be
your first time.

11:56.710 --> 11:57.710
You coming?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.580
May said this ship
can't travel far in space.

12:04.580 --> 12:05.790
It can't.

12:05.790 --> 12:08.250
Sibyl's whole plan
is based on her projections.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.710
So the only way to get ahead
is to act unpredictably.

12:11.710 --> 12:14.250
Do things against our nature,
which, for you --

12:14.250 --> 12:16.710
Is leaving my post.
And you?

12:16.710 --> 12:18.290
Sibyl dropped Kora
in my lap

12:18.290 --> 12:19.920
because they knew
I'd want to save her.

12:19.920 --> 12:24.040
The thing is, I already have
a sister to save.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.920
Her name
is Jemma Simmons.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.380
Won't we use all the fuel
getting out of the atmosphere?

12:31.380 --> 12:32.790
Well, almost.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.750
We'll find Z1's location,

12:34.750 --> 12:36.250
we'll aim for it,

12:36.250 --> 12:38.960
we'll burn the rest of our fuel
and float.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.120
Yeah.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.620
So it's a 100,000-mile
Hail Mary?

12:44.460 --> 12:46.210
As long as you know
what you're doing.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.420
Yeah...

12:51.420 --> 12:54.250
You have flown this thing
before, right?

12:54.250 --> 12:55.830
A few times?

12:56.880 --> 12:59.210
A time?

12:59.210 --> 13:01.710
It's your last chance
to stay behind.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.250
Without fail.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.540
What? You said you've done this
zero times.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.250
I mean, everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D.
has flown a Quinjet.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.420
Literally everyone.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.580
I hear take-off is
a piece of cake.

13:16.580 --> 13:20.330
Then how are you gonna
get the hangar doors open

13:20.330 --> 13:23.040
without
Director authorization?

13:26.670 --> 13:28.750
This is the only way
to bring back Deke and Simmons.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.290
By stealing the Quinjet?

13:30.290 --> 13:31.460
Abandoning your sister?

13:31.460 --> 13:32.960
No.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.750
Well, yes, actually.
Exactly that.

13:35.750 --> 13:38.670
If we're gonna beat Sibyl, we --
we have to be unpredictable.

13:38.670 --> 13:40.790
We can't --
We can't play by her rules.

13:46.170 --> 13:49.080
How's this
for unpredictable?

13:49.080 --> 13:50.710
Authorization granted.

13:53.540 --> 13:55.920
Now give me that seat
before I change my mind.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.960
First Simmons and Deke.
Now Mack and Daisy.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.620
They're heading to space --

14:34.330 --> 14:36.000
This isn't smart.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.830
I don't like it.
I do.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.330
If you're trying to beat
a super-computing oracle,

14:40.330 --> 14:42.040
you have to go
against the flow.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.790
Shake things up.

14:43.790 --> 14:46.830
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
going rogue...

14:46.830 --> 14:48.670
Yeah, I've seen that happen
before.

14:51.380 --> 14:54.040
It's up to us
to predict her next move.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.620
What were you feeling
off her...

14:55.620 --> 14:58.000
you know,
aura or whatever?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.460
She seemed sincere.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.250
Her rage
was tamped down.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.920
Why don't you
take a run at her,

15:02.920 --> 15:04.750
see what else
comes to the surface?

15:08.790 --> 15:09.960
Leave him alone!

15:09.960 --> 15:12.080
It's okay, Jemma,
he's got nothing --

15:12.080 --> 15:13.420
Oh!

15:14.210 --> 15:16.210
Okay.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.620
That was something,
but I'm okay.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.420
He'll tire out eventually.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.420
Someone's got a mouth
on him.

15:22.420 --> 15:25.920
Physical pain won't break you,
congratulations.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.040
Now let's try
the emotional variety.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.330
That's usually
a little harder to break.

15:30.330 --> 15:35.120
What if I crack her skull,
put her in a coma,

15:35.120 --> 15:38.750
and then go fishing around
in her brain?

15:38.750 --> 15:41.000
Stop!
How is she blocking me
from Fitz?!

15:45.920 --> 15:47.040
Never mind.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.040
If you think that
you can --

15:49.170 --> 15:51.710
That's for my old man.

15:54.540 --> 15:57.540
Find a way to get whatever
that is out of her head.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.710
Guys, my stomach feels...

16:15.710 --> 16:17.120
Whoa.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.210
Thank you.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.620
Now that we're
out of the atmosphere,

16:33.620 --> 16:36.580
we should be able to
lock on to the Zephyr.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.000
My goodness.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.170
It's really something,
huh?

16:47.670 --> 16:49.830
All right.

16:49.830 --> 16:52.040
Better strap in there,
buddy.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.670
This next part's
gonna be tricky.

16:53.670 --> 16:56.210
Seriously, if this isn't
timed out just right,

16:56.210 --> 16:58.080
we will freeze to death
in the dark void of space.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.330
So, buckle up,
Danny Boy.

17:00.330 --> 17:03.960
Okay.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.750
Triangulating burn path
to Z1.

17:06.750 --> 17:10.920
Executing controlled burn
in 3, 2, 1.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.960
Where's Daisy?

17:26.960 --> 17:28.880
Places to go,
people to see.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.380
Well, I want to
talk to her.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.750
I can feel
your disappointment,

17:33.750 --> 17:35.040
but I was hoping
that you and I

17:35.040 --> 17:36.080
could get to
know each other --

17:36.080 --> 17:38.500
I already know you.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.040
The Cavalry.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.040
I saw how you handled
that poor girl in Bahrain.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.170
She was out of control.

17:44.170 --> 17:45.880
I made peace with that
a while ago.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.250
What you did was sickening.
She was just a child.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.880
Who would have done
worse.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.250
Isn't that what your list
is about?

17:51.250 --> 17:52.830
She had a power
that she couldn't control.

17:52.830 --> 17:53.880
That wasn't her fault.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.540
She fed off suffering.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.830
Do you?

17:57.830 --> 17:59.380
Did you take pleasure
in killing?

17:59.380 --> 18:00.960
Li thought
I was out of control.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.960
You were.
I saw it.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.040
I was being confined.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.710
Suffocated.
I needed out!

18:07.710 --> 18:10.170
Okay, calm down, show me that
you can control your power.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.540
Or what? Huh?
You'll strangle me?!

18:12.540 --> 18:13.290
Kora --

18:13.290 --> 18:14.750
You want to see control?

18:36.040 --> 18:38.170
You okay?

18:38.170 --> 18:41.080
She took out the Lighthouse's
power with one punch.

18:44.830 --> 18:47.250
And lowered
our firewalls...

18:47.250 --> 18:49.080
for Sibyl.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.420
That's what
Kora was here for.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.210
Sibyl was still
in the power grid --

19:06.210 --> 19:08.210
Yeah, now she's back
in our computers.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.920
At least
she's just code.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.120
I know what that's like.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.080
Thirsty, Sibyl?

19:15.080 --> 19:18.170
"I know only hunger now."

19:18.170 --> 19:20.500
That's not creepy at all.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.500
"You killed my Hunters.
Prepare to meet the same --"

19:25.500 --> 19:27.750
You know, maybe don't recite
the messages out loud,

19:27.750 --> 19:30.540
I can read English,
so I'm good.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.580
Hey, can you read
the rest of it?

19:40.080 --> 19:42.500
You just said you know
what it's like to be code.

19:48.290 --> 19:50.580
I don't...think so...

19:59.920 --> 20:01.620
Daisy: We're never going home,
are we?

20:05.250 --> 20:07.120
You think
it's still out there?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.880
The O.G. timeline?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.420
I pray it is. But...

20:11.420 --> 20:14.620
...who knows?

20:14.620 --> 20:17.120
All right, this should be

20:17.120 --> 20:22.170
everything but the life support
and grav systems.

20:24.210 --> 20:27.500
Okay.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.620
Should try
to conserve oxygen.

20:48.250 --> 20:52.170
Enoch said this will be the
team's last mission together.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.210
Even if we survive?

20:58.210 --> 21:00.880
That was my impression,
yeah.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.830
Well, maybe it's time.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.500
We've had a crazy run.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.120
What?

21:10.120 --> 21:12.540
How can you say that?

21:12.540 --> 21:15.620
It's just -- That's it?
Just, "Talk to you later"?

21:15.620 --> 21:17.500
That...

21:17.500 --> 21:20.040
Look, we have these things
called phones.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.380
Now, I know -- I know you
millennials like to use them

21:22.380 --> 21:23.960
just for taking pictures
of yourselves,

21:23.960 --> 21:27.250
but in the '80s, we actually
used them to talk to each other.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.500
I'm serious. What...

21:29.500 --> 21:31.420
We're not just
gonna turn into

21:31.420 --> 21:34.290
the people who used to
work together

21:34.290 --> 21:36.460
and, you know, "Well, hey,
I'm in town,"

21:36.460 --> 21:38.620
and, "We used to be close
a long time ago."

21:38.620 --> 21:39.880
That's...

21:39.880 --> 21:42.710
Sounds like we might.

21:42.710 --> 21:44.380
Mack...

21:44.380 --> 21:46.290
The...

21:49.750 --> 21:53.170
You guys are my family.

21:53.170 --> 21:55.880
I don't know
who I am without you guys.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.040
Daisy --
No, it's --

21:58.540 --> 22:01.620
You know exactly
who you are.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.670
With anyone.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.960
Ugh, oof.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.880
What?
Really. Subtle.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.290
Stop.
Cool.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.790
In the --
In the time loops, we...

22:24.790 --> 22:26.290
we kind of kissed.

22:26.290 --> 22:28.620
Whatever.
He's a dork.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.580
See, that's messed up, because
he doesn't remember that.

22:30.580 --> 22:33.580
Then why are you smiling?

22:33.580 --> 22:35.330
'Cause Yo-Yo owes me $20.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.670
It won't be the same.

22:41.670 --> 22:45.380
No, it won't.

22:48.330 --> 22:49.750
But...

22:51.330 --> 22:53.500
...that's okay.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.620
But why
won't this work?!

23:01.620 --> 23:04.120
I'm the only one
who can use the device.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.330
There's a zero percent
probability

23:06.330 --> 23:08.460
you'll be able to extract
the implant with it.

23:08.460 --> 23:10.290
Fitz isn't coming to save you
this time.

23:10.290 --> 23:12.040
You know that for sure?

23:16.210 --> 23:17.710
Nathaniel:
Sorry about that.

23:17.710 --> 23:20.920
Just used to getting
the things I want, I guess.

23:23.380 --> 23:24.790
I'll climb in your mind
with you.

23:27.670 --> 23:29.420
Find that little wizard
myself.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.120
The more you dig,
the deeper Fitz will go

23:34.120 --> 23:35.540
until he's disappeared
completely.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.250
Then the race is on.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.830
If he moves, kill him.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.420
Enoch: We must act now.
Yeah, of course.

23:54.420 --> 23:56.960
This will be the hardest thing
you have ever done.

23:56.960 --> 24:00.500
Hello, there he is.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.500
Now, let's go deeper.
What happened next?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.670
Power's back up
in the rest of the base.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.790
Yo-Yo said the prisoners
are...

24:07.790 --> 24:09.170
What are you doing?

24:09.170 --> 24:10.380
Sibyl's looking
for something.

24:10.380 --> 24:11.750
Communication files.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.750
You can read it.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.790
Ehhh, I'm getting
bits and pieces.

24:15.790 --> 24:18.170
I'm trying to slow her down by
disrupting the log aggregation,

24:18.170 --> 24:19.330
and that is literally

24:19.330 --> 24:21.250
the first time I've heard
those words out loud.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.670
How do you even know
what that is?

24:22.670 --> 24:23.710
I don't know
what that is.

24:23.710 --> 24:26.250
I just...
know how it works.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.880
But all I can do
is slow her down.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.830
The only person who can purge
her from the power is --

24:29.830 --> 24:31.080
Kora.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.500
She got Sibyl in,
so she can get her out.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.000
We got to get her
to come around.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.880
She's due
for the Coulson talk.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.210
I don't think so.

24:42.210 --> 24:44.120
That's your duty now.

24:44.120 --> 24:48.170
I've got a new superpower I'm
very busy with, but so do you.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.290
We're not
who we used to be.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.830
But I -- I talked to her
already,

24:52.830 --> 24:55.250
and -- and -- and
look how that turned out.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.040
You were trying
to get a rise.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.710
To see how dangerous
she is.

24:58.710 --> 25:00.290
Now see how good
she can be.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.460
Like you did with Yo-Yo.

25:01.460 --> 25:04.380
Like you always did
with her sister.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.880
With me.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.670
Brand-new day, right?

25:40.750 --> 25:42.830
God! Okay, okay, okay,
you got me.

25:42.830 --> 25:44.460
The automatic locks
are --

25:47.880 --> 25:49.830
Durant.

25:49.830 --> 25:52.210
You know, S.H.I.E.L.D.
killed him once.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.460
He tried
to cut my throat.

25:54.460 --> 25:58.380
Hey, I was just
following orders.

25:58.380 --> 26:01.170
You see?

26:01.170 --> 26:04.250
These are the lives Malick
is saving, Kora.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.540
Not heroes, hit men.

26:06.540 --> 26:08.500
Who now owe their lives
to him.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.040
And so do you.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.000
You would prefer
we didn't survive?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.580
We want you to stop helping
Nathaniel and the Chronicoms

26:14.580 --> 26:16.120
sow chaos.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.500
They're tearing us away from
a timeline we need to restore.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.000
There.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.210
Now we're
a little bit closer to it.

26:34.210 --> 26:35.710
Does that feel better?

26:40.330 --> 26:42.330
Kora: I can keep pushing
the stream

26:42.330 --> 26:44.420
back toward your timeline
if you want.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.750
Your new friend Sousa
would be next.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.170
Or...

26:47.170 --> 26:49.710
We start checking names
off your list?

26:49.710 --> 26:50.960
Not a chance.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.710
What's the first name?

26:52.710 --> 26:53.620
Yo-Yo.

26:53.620 --> 26:54.750
Why not?

26:54.750 --> 26:55.960
Let's hear them.

26:55.960 --> 26:58.080
If she's gonna go kill,

26:58.080 --> 26:59.790
let's at least point her
in the right direction.

26:59.790 --> 27:02.620
There's no name that comes free
of consequence, we have to --

27:02.620 --> 27:04.040
Grant Ward.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.960
He's just a child right now.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.920
You're not against
killing kids.

27:14.880 --> 27:19.250
So much pain can be averted
with one death.

27:19.250 --> 27:21.000
Andrew can be here
with you.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.960
Rosalind. Lincoln.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.420
Is Garrett next, then?

27:24.420 --> 27:26.210
Because it was your Messiah's
right hand

27:26.210 --> 27:27.710
who made Ward who he was.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.880
Without Garrett,
Ward would've been worse.

27:29.880 --> 27:33.120
We've seen a world
where Ward was good,

27:33.120 --> 27:35.830
where he was put on the right
path by the right person.

27:35.830 --> 27:37.210
People can change.

27:37.210 --> 27:38.460
Even you.

27:38.460 --> 27:40.540
My mom thought that,
too.

27:43.170 --> 27:46.290
No, this is who I am.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.790
Who I'm meant to be.

27:47.790 --> 27:51.000
And someday,
I'm gonna show her that.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.120
Jiaying's here.

27:57.670 --> 28:00.210
How about we show her
right now?

28:09.170 --> 28:11.710
We used to hope for this,
you know.

28:11.710 --> 28:14.620
Everyone in my time.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.920
It was a dream,
but a dream we all thought --

28:16.920 --> 28:19.000
Sousa...

28:19.000 --> 28:22.290
Preserve oxygen.
Copy that.

28:22.290 --> 28:23.920
What are your intentions?

28:23.920 --> 28:25.750
Sir?

28:25.750 --> 28:28.170
With Daisy.

28:28.170 --> 28:31.210
I don't have
any intentions.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.000
Well, then,
you better get some.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.880
And quick.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.790
'Cause this thing
is coming for you.

28:36.790 --> 28:37.620
This...thing?

28:40.960 --> 28:42.500
She's into you.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.460
And I'm not even sure
she knows it yet,

28:44.460 --> 28:46.170
but pretty soon,
she'll figure it out.

28:46.170 --> 28:47.670
And when she does...

28:49.670 --> 28:51.250
...watch out.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.790
'Cause when she gets something
into her head --

28:52.790 --> 28:56.750
She won't stop.
Yeah, I noticed.

28:56.750 --> 28:59.420
But listen...

28:59.420 --> 29:01.420
Daisy's been hurt.

29:01.420 --> 29:04.000
Bad.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.920
So I'm happy
she's ready to dive back in,

29:07.920 --> 29:09.620
and I'm happy it's you.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.250
I like you.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.460
You seem like a good man.
Thanks, I --

29:13.460 --> 29:16.290
Even if you're a little,
you know, straight ahead --

29:16.290 --> 29:17.540
Wait, is that bad?

29:17.540 --> 29:19.790
But I'm not about
to let her get hurt again.

29:21.710 --> 29:22.750
You hear what I'm saying?

29:22.750 --> 29:24.170
I think so.

29:24.170 --> 29:25.330
I think you're...

29:25.330 --> 29:26.500
threatening me. Sir.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.620
No.

29:28.620 --> 29:31.420
Not just me.

29:31.420 --> 29:34.500
Every member
of this team.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.620
And we have technology
at S.H.I.E.L.D. that
you've never even --

29:36.620 --> 29:38.750
I hear you.

29:38.750 --> 29:40.170
Loud and clear.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.210
I would never hurt her.

29:51.710 --> 29:53.670
Hmm.

29:53.670 --> 29:56.790
Imagine that.

29:56.790 --> 30:00.380
The man out of time
and Quake.

30:00.380 --> 30:03.000
Just like a damn comic book.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.040
Hold on.
What did you just call her?

30:04.040 --> 30:06.080
Hmm? Uh, Quake.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.880
It's, uh --
It's her superhero name.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.670
Really?

30:10.670 --> 30:13.540
Yeah. Yeah, really.

30:13.540 --> 30:17.750
Quake?
Mm-hmm.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.920
Do you not hear
how hilarious that sounds?

30:23.540 --> 30:24.750
Quake.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.830
I do now.

30:36.580 --> 30:38.000
Quake.

30:44.380 --> 30:45.790
Simmons:
I've studied brains before,

30:45.790 --> 30:47.710
but it's another thing
to study your own.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.670
Do not despair.

30:49.670 --> 30:52.290
Yours is one of the
better brains I have seen.

30:52.290 --> 30:54.330
You look at a lot of brains,
Enoch?

30:54.330 --> 30:57.750
The 19th century was
a strange time for humanity.

31:05.170 --> 31:06.620
Much better.

31:06.620 --> 31:10.580
Have to admit, I might be
getting a bit jealous...

31:10.580 --> 31:13.080
of all the time you two
are spending together.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.620
Fitz, I think we may be close
to a working design.

31:16.620 --> 31:19.920
Well, I'm not.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.540
I need better materials.
Not this salvaged scrap.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.790
It's a good thing
we are building a time machine,

31:24.790 --> 31:27.420
as it does not matter
how long it takes.

31:27.420 --> 31:30.170
Well, thanks for the vote
of confidence, Enoch.

31:30.170 --> 31:31.330
Can you give us
a moment?

31:31.330 --> 31:32.790
Yes.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.620
Oh, to yourselves.

31:39.620 --> 31:40.920
Of course.

31:42.670 --> 31:44.420
With this working,
and you in the building phase,

31:44.420 --> 31:48.620
we'll be able to rush back to
the temple before we know it.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.580
Or not.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.670
Enoch's not wrong.

31:56.670 --> 32:00.460
It doesn't matter
how long we take.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.000
So...

32:04.830 --> 32:06.920
We don't have to rush.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.500
We could just
take some time to...

32:09.500 --> 32:11.330
live.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.960
Fitz...
We've built a nice home
for ourselves here.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.120
We could spruce it up.

32:18.080 --> 32:22.120
Live, together.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.080
No mission,

32:24.080 --> 32:27.960
no end of the world.

32:27.960 --> 32:31.920
We could just...be.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.620
Is this
about the blood work?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.120
No.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.920
And yeah.

32:39.920 --> 32:44.290
But because we deserve it
regardless.

32:44.290 --> 32:46.330
We don't even know
if it's --

32:46.330 --> 32:48.000
Listen.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.080
If May and Coulson
taught us anything,

32:51.080 --> 32:52.880
it's that we should
take the time that we have.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.330
Ominous.

32:57.330 --> 33:00.750
But I need to see that home
you built.

33:00.750 --> 33:03.670
Let's cycle through
your last memories together.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.620
I'm gonna give you
something

33:11.620 --> 33:14.080
no one has given you
in a long time.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.580
And what's that?

33:16.580 --> 33:18.670
The truth.

33:58.710 --> 34:00.170
It's okay.

34:04.920 --> 34:08.120
It's okay, she can heal.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.670
That's her power.
She just --

34:09.670 --> 34:11.750
She just needs some help.

34:15.710 --> 34:17.880
Just take my energy.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.670
Come on.
Take my energy.

34:20.670 --> 34:23.120
Go on.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.000
Mom, please.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.380
Please heal.

34:35.420 --> 34:38.750
Her neck,
it's shattered.

34:38.750 --> 34:40.920
A quake...

34:40.920 --> 34:42.210
Where's my sister?

34:42.210 --> 34:44.120
You know who did this,
Kora.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.420
No, he must have
had a reason.

34:52.460 --> 34:56.670
She attacked Nathaniel,
or he was protecting me --

34:56.670 --> 35:00.710
Your mother died
protecting Daisy from him.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.790
Here we go.
No.

35:09.790 --> 35:12.250
No, this isn't what the implant
was built to do.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.670
We have no choice.
Wait a minute.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.710
It was supposed to forget
your location, that's all.

35:15.710 --> 35:16.960
I know,
but that was before we knew.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.460
Not this.

35:19.460 --> 35:22.080
Never this.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.750
You have to be strong,
okay?

35:23.750 --> 35:25.210
And if you remember,

35:25.210 --> 35:27.460
you won't be able to be strong
to do what you have to do.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.750
No, no, no!
Where we are?

35:30.750 --> 35:32.460
You can't ask me
to do this!

35:32.460 --> 35:34.000
Saying goodbye
is hard enough!

35:34.000 --> 35:36.330
Yeah, but you won't remember
what you've forgotten.

35:36.330 --> 35:38.710
You won't know.
Where are you?!

35:38.710 --> 35:40.710
But I'll feel the guilt
inside.

35:40.710 --> 35:43.120
The guilt for having left,
a part of me being torn away --
Listen to me.

35:43.120 --> 35:46.500
I don't want to forget!
I don't want to forget!
Hey, hey, it's gonna be --
it's gonna be okay.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.620
I don't want to forget!
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.710
I don't want to forget,
I don't want to forget,

35:50.710 --> 35:51.960
I don't want to forget,
I don't want to forget.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.540
Mm!

36:06.120 --> 36:08.670
We'll see
if it even matters.

36:08.670 --> 36:10.580
The two of you
have just scored front-row seats

36:10.580 --> 36:12.960
to the greatest show
on Earth.

36:22.790 --> 36:24.380
Are you okay?

36:24.380 --> 36:27.620
Am I okay? Are you okay?
What happened in there?

36:27.620 --> 36:30.040
I'm guessing from his attitude
that he didn't find Fitz.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.750
Fitz?

36:31.750 --> 36:33.620
Who's Fitz?

36:39.210 --> 36:43.330
Jiaying wasn't perfect,
but you loved each other.

36:43.330 --> 36:44.790
I felt it.

36:44.790 --> 36:46.290
No.

36:46.290 --> 36:49.920
She loved who I was.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.670
I changed and it faded --

36:52.670 --> 36:55.670
a long time ago.

36:55.670 --> 36:58.540
That change was painful,

36:58.540 --> 37:02.380
but Nathaniel is using that pain
against you.

37:02.380 --> 37:03.380
Using you.

37:03.380 --> 37:05.960
Nathaniel isn't using me.

37:05.960 --> 37:09.120
He saved me.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.040
He showed me
how to live again.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.960
And I can never repay him
for that.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.960
All he wants is chaos.

37:14.960 --> 37:18.290
Chaos.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.500
You're not using my pain?

37:24.380 --> 37:27.500
Do you know
what I'm capable of?

37:27.500 --> 37:29.380
You think you feel
what's inside me?

37:31.790 --> 37:33.670
Yes.

37:48.380 --> 37:49.750
Kora...

38:07.540 --> 38:09.210
Time to go, sunshine.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.120
What are you, like,
a computer genius now?

38:20.670 --> 38:22.210
Yes.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.170
What do we have here?

38:25.170 --> 38:27.380
The last thing
Sibyl accessed.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.120
The S.H.I.E.L.D. bases.

38:31.120 --> 38:35.960
Yep. Everything from the Hub
to the Sandbox to the...

38:35.960 --> 38:39.170
Oh, no.
Coulson, what is it?

38:39.170 --> 38:41.290
They didn't go to space
to hide.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.830
I have a visual on Z1.

38:44.830 --> 38:46.880
A few minutes out.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.170
Be prepped for docking.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.670
Hey.

38:53.670 --> 38:55.210
Thank you.

38:55.210 --> 38:56.580
For what?

38:56.580 --> 38:58.790
Just, being here.

38:58.790 --> 39:02.710
It was nothing,
but you're welcome...

39:02.710 --> 39:04.080
Quake.

39:06.210 --> 39:07.500
I'm sorry, what, now?

39:07.500 --> 39:10.580
Nothing, just happy to help,
Quake. Whatever you need.

39:10.580 --> 39:12.250
Are you being funny?

39:12.250 --> 39:13.670
Uh, is it funny?

39:13.670 --> 39:16.380
Not if that's what you like
to be called...Quake.

39:16.380 --> 39:19.120
I --
The press called me that.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.620
I never --
You should probably have a Q
on your utility belt

39:21.620 --> 39:23.420
so people know it's you.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.000
That is really smart,
yeah.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.290
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
make fun of the person

39:28.290 --> 39:31.080
who can literally
turn you to dust.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.750
Yeah, you can Quake me.
No, I get it.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.330
That's why they call you
that.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.620
Mack, what's happening?

39:42.620 --> 39:44.460
You tell me.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.920
That's why
he came up here.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.540
To call reinforcements.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.580
Sir, the Chronicom ships
are --

40:04.830 --> 40:09.580
What did I say
about calling me sir?!

40:09.580 --> 40:12.330
Was I not very specific

40:12.330 --> 40:16.420
about how the new world order
would be structured?

40:16.420 --> 40:18.210
These are
the Chronicom ships?

40:20.500 --> 40:23.580
Sibyl contacted her home planet
years ago.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.880
Had her Hunters make some
modifications to their fleet.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.710
The signal we sent
called them here.

40:34.380 --> 40:37.580
To all Chronicom vessels,
this is Nathaniel Malick.

40:37.580 --> 40:39.920
Your Predictor Sibyl
has given you your marks.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.710
You may fire
whenever you want.

40:49.710 --> 40:52.500
Repeat, this is the Lighthouse,
do you copy?

40:52.500 --> 40:54.290
Man: 10-4 Lighthouse,
this is the Hub.

40:54.290 --> 40:55.710
Good to hear from you.

40:55.710 --> 40:56.960
We thought that base
was decom--

40:59.120 --> 41:01.120
Oh, no.

41:06.170 --> 41:08.460
They're doing it.

41:12.750 --> 41:14.920
They're destroying
S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:32.710 --> 41:35.540
Garrett: Always wanted to be
a part of something bigger.

41:35.540 --> 41:37.580
And we're just getting started.

41:42.830 --> 41:43.830
Kora.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.920
You are a sight
for sore eyes.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.080
Thank you for today.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.670
Couldn't have done it
without you.

42:02.790 --> 42:04.500
Did we give people
new life?

42:04.500 --> 42:07.250
We did.

42:07.250 --> 42:09.670
By ending so, so many.
