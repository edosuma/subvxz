09:10.724 --> 09:12.160
Honestly, it's just
one less thing

09:12.203 --> 09:13.509
hanging over my head right now.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.510
Can you do me a favor
and make sure

09:14.554 --> 09:15.772
nothing goes wrong
tomorrow?

09:15.816 --> 09:17.513
JHARREL:
And Keisha's already met

09:17.557 --> 09:20.298
with Claudette and Shanice
about where they'd like to go.

09:20.342 --> 09:24.041
So would you like us
to contact family for you both?

09:24.085 --> 09:26.000
We can probably get them
out here in time.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.655
I do hope to reach out
eventually.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.178
But I want to learn

09:30.221 --> 09:31.701
what I can about
what's happened

09:31.745 --> 09:33.660
in these intervening years
before I do.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.226
I owe my son that much.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.098
Okay.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.708
How about you, LaDonna?

09:38.752 --> 09:41.624
Your mom's been
reaching out.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.061
Um, no, that's okay.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.367
Seems like a whole hassle.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.934
But maybe next time.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.023
I a-- I actually was
thinking a library.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.546
The library?

09:50.590 --> 09:51.939
Really?
Wh-- Yeah.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.767
I mean, I need to,
you know, brush up

09:53.810 --> 09:56.073
on fashion and gossip
that I missed.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.597
REV:
I'd enjoy that.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.424
And I'd like to go
to a house of God.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.992
I hear Detroit has
some beautiful old churches.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.648
Okay.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.607
Let's do this.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.348
HAYDEN:
Where's Dr. Andre?

10:10.392 --> 10:12.046
MILDRED:
I don't know,

10:12.089 --> 10:13.264
but you want to see
something cool?

10:20.707 --> 10:23.927
I kind of did it to Shanice's
ankle monitor by accident

10:23.971 --> 10:26.669
when we were hanging out,
and no one came to get her.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.760
Now she can just take it off
and on whenever she wants,

10:30.804 --> 10:32.806
and the guards can't tell.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.460
[door opens]

10:35.504 --> 10:36.984
ANDRE:
Ah, wonderful.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.550
You're both here.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.901
I hope to have your
help in figuring out

10:40.944 --> 10:42.903
why some of us have powers,

10:42.946 --> 10:44.644
why some of us don't

10:44.687 --> 10:45.775
and how they all work.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.864
Sounds groovy.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.694
Let us take
a baseline pulse first.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.438
I was born this way.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.048
It wasn't an accident.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.441
All right.

10:59.484 --> 11:02.444
So, what kind
of a doctor were you?

11:02.487 --> 11:05.839
I was a medic in the Great War.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.711
When I returned,
I ran a clinic,

11:08.755 --> 11:12.846
but then I began focusing on
respiratory and bronchial issues

11:12.889 --> 11:14.891
in my research.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.328
It was most groundbreaking.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.069
It was indeed

11:19.113 --> 11:21.245
a splendid affair,

11:21.289 --> 11:24.509
and I raised
the remaining funds needed

11:24.553 --> 11:25.685
to move us to human trials.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.557
And would you believe,

11:28.600 --> 11:29.993
they loved the story
of how that last rat

11:30.037 --> 11:31.821
was the final subject I cured.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.257
[chuckles]

11:33.301 --> 11:34.868
I even told them

11:34.911 --> 11:37.392
that it was my assistant
that named him Gustavo.

11:37.435 --> 11:41.091
With all due respect, sir,
I would appreciate you

11:41.135 --> 11:43.311
not referring to me
as your assistant.

11:43.354 --> 11:46.923
Andre, focus
on what matters.

11:46.967 --> 11:50.492
We are so very close
to curing whooping cough,

11:50.535 --> 11:51.972
and eventually
all bronchial diseases

11:52.015 --> 11:54.452
with this new chemical medicine.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.803
We both know
it's the work

11:56.846 --> 11:58.718
that truly matters.And we both know

11:58.761 --> 12:01.546
I am the one in the lab
all hours.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.766
I am the one
taking the calculations

12:03.810 --> 12:06.073
and refining the treatment.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.031
I should receive
the credit I deserve.

12:08.075 --> 12:11.339
Andre, you should be pleased
I mentioned you

12:11.382 --> 12:12.775
in the first place.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.126
Till tomorrow.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.047
Earth to Andre.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.919
Ah. Yes.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.530
My apologies, Shanice.
I'm just, uh...

12:28.573 --> 12:29.879
Focused on your work.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.402
Yeah.

12:31.446 --> 12:35.406
Any insights
into these... powers?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.408
Not as much as I'd like.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.497
If I could just get access
to what I need,

12:39.541 --> 12:42.413
I know I could find answers,
but my hands are tied.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.415
I know it's frustrating,

12:44.459 --> 12:46.548
but you don't have
to solve it all right away.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.332
That's easy for you to say.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.465
You're allowed out in the world,

12:50.508 --> 12:52.206
instead of being trapped in
here like a rat in a cage.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.425
And a useless one at that.Look, I know.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.905
It's not fair.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.602
I tried to stand up
for you, too,

12:57.646 --> 12:59.517
when we met up with Keisha...I know.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.171
It is appreciated.

not seeing your daughter

13:07.525 --> 13:09.745

13:09.789 --> 13:12.139
I am not certain of anything.

13:12.182 --> 13:16.883
I feel like I barely made things
right between us, and...

13:16.926 --> 13:19.581
I don't want
to mess it up again.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.149

who I am

13:30.897 --> 13:33.943
But I was just married to him
two weeks ago.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.554
Am I just supposed
to flip a switch?

13:42.430 --> 13:44.867
Uh, please,

13:44.911 --> 13:47.957

Do you really think going rogue
is a good idea?

she leaked the video.

taking a different exit

in our human trials.

our lucky number seven.

this treatment.

they don't know anything.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.152
Yeah, then why not let us in
on what they got?

34:27.195 --> 34:30.372

with their local partners?
