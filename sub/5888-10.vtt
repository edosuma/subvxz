NARRATOR:
A few weeks ago,

00:03.962 --> 00:06.339
an invisible dome crashed down
on Chester’s Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.920
Why the dome is here
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.136 --> 00:14.503
we still don 't know.
Every day, it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.305
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.180
Some say
we 7/ be stuck here forever,

00:21.980 --> 00:25.723
but we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.892
DON:
Hunter May, meet my son, Dale.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.442
We need you to work your magic.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.862
- Send one message into the dome.
- Barbie!

00:32.074 --> 00:34.110
- Don'tjump!
JULIA: Barbie!

00:34.326 --> 00:36.863
Maybe the guys who took Barbie
are the same ones who want the egg.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.990
- How would they even know?
- We'll protect it.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.572
No better place to hide
than right under my dad's nose.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.248
And you all think it powers the dome.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.917
- That's the working theory, right?
- Yeah.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.996
It's my job to lead the people
of this town to freedom.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.673
BARBIE: Who are you?
- A friend of mine. Pauline Verdreaux.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.800
- Pauline Rennie?
- James' mother.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.677
That door's the way back
into the dome.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.849
BARBIE:
I know where this is. Grew up there.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.973
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.645
What the hell?

01:06.108 --> 01:08.770
- We're back somehow.
- Pauline?

01:13.824 --> 01:15.064
Paane?

01:20.163 --> 01:21.198
It's me.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.406
That's impossible. You...

01:24.293 --> 01:26.204
What are you doing here?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.924
Did the dome send you?

01:34.386 --> 01:36.217
Like Linda and Dodee
to torment me?

01:36.430 --> 01:37.840
What?

01:38.056 --> 01:39.796
No, Jim.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.434
It's really me.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.304
No, no.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.893
No, you died.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.480
- You died nine years ago.
- l was never dead.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.185
You drove your car into a tree.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.566
I saw the wreck.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.569
| read the report.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.115
I picked out your casket.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.826
It was a cadaver.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.534
Lester Coggins helped me,
and Lyle too.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.290
He knew what to use
to make the car burn

02:10.505 --> 02:11.961
so that there would be nothing left.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.666
- It was the only way.
- The only way for what?

02:16.887 --> 02:19.378
It was the only way
to get out of Chester's Mill.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.263
I told you about my visions.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.844
You saw my paintings.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.100
I knew something terrible
was coming.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.145
So you ran away
and left me and Junior?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.727
To protect my family.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.937
I thought the dome would follow me.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.818
And you would never let me go.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.400
You're gonna stand here

02:42.162 --> 02:45.450
in your son's room
and make excuses to me?

02:45.666 --> 02:49.033
- Stop it.
- You destroyed him, Pauline.

02:49.544 --> 02:53.378
- You destroyed your own son.
- Stop.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.208
For all these years,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.466
- I thought it was my fault.
- Jim.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.766
Jim, I came back.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.845
Jim, I came back!

03:11.650 --> 03:13.982
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.900
Look at this.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.569
See anything strange?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.484
Its leaves have turned.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.695
Like it's fall.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.743
Except it's summer.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.287
The temperature's dropped
in the last two days.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.784
This is an oak.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.286
One of the first to change.

03:32.504 --> 03:33.960
Any idea why this is happening?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.172
Somehow the dome
is accelerating the seasons.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.043
Normally, fall's my favorite.

03:41.555 --> 03:47.175
Book by the fire, nice glass of Pinot,
but this is just odd.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.054
JULIA:
Oh, my God.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.390
REBECCA:
Julia.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.267
Julia?

04:00.532 --> 04:01.692
You came back.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.648
I did.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.579
I'm gonna get everybody out.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.158
What happened?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.330
How are you here?

04:17.048 --> 04:19.130
Barbie, how the hell
did you get back?

04:21.303 --> 04:22.418
Let's talk inside.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.549
It's freezing.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.219
Since when did it become Alaska
in here?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.639
No kidding.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.602
And, uh, Melanie's not here.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.024
Junior either.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.272
We have the whole place
to ourselves.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.696
Better keep each other warm.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.068
[NORRIE CHUCKLES]

04:49.247 --> 04:51.078
Wait, Melanie hasn't been here
in like a day.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.998
She's probably at Julia's.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.875
Out doing Jane Fonda exercises,
whatever people did in the '80s.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.169
Come back.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.384
Oh, my God, Joe. The egg is gone.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.882
What? You think she took it?

05:07.098 --> 05:09.589
The way she protects that thing,
I bet she did.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.176
Come on, let's go find her.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.605
Junior?

05:27.244 --> 05:28.825
Sorry.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.951
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- It's okay.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.205
I should go.

05:37.838 --> 05:38.873
Julia might be worried.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.497
I shouldn't have let us fall asleep.

05:41.716 --> 05:45.379
If she's mad I didn't come home,
I'll just blame it on you.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.466
Tell her you looked me up
down here.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.263
What?

05:50.475 --> 05:52.090
I was just kidding.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.186
Um...

05:57.816 --> 05:59.772
You're sure the egg's safe
down here?

05:59.985 --> 06:03.898
Uh, this place is built
to withstand nuclear bombs.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.103
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

06:05.323 --> 06:10.568
- It's the safest place in town.
- Well, I guess I'll see you later.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.329
Yes. See you later.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.512
ANGIE:
Junior.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.223
- Angie?
- Think about what you're doing.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.192
With her down here?

06:45.447 --> 06:46.653
It's not what you think.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.231
You're gonna wanna follow
your heart.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.066
Don't.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.905
[GASPS]

06:54.581 --> 06:56.037
I don't know what you mean.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.119
MELANIE:
Junior?

07:02.339 --> 07:03.670
Did you say something?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.798
- No.
- Okay.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.255
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.393
Angie?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.096
Angie?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.579
So you jump off an underground cliff

07:38.792 --> 07:41.033
and somehow land all the way
in Zenith?

07:41.252 --> 07:44.039
- Where you wake up on a playground.
- Surprised the hell out of me too.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.416
But the same thing happened
to Sam and Lyle.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.873
REBECCA:
And you feel okay?

07:48.093 --> 07:51.176
No physical injuries
or psychological disturbances?

07:51.388 --> 07:55.256
The way there was a blur,
but I woke up, I was fine.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.716
The way back,

07:58.353 --> 08:01.265
I had this memory
from a long time ago.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.096
What?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.646
It was just something
from when I was a kid.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.272
How'd the others fare?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.605
Well, Lyle,

08:11.950 --> 08:14.737
he didn't come up out of the water
with the rest of us.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.035
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.784
You know, maybe he came up first.
He drowned.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.286
Or maybe he's trapped
somewhere in between.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.494
I don't know. What matters
is that we can use that cliff

08:25.714 --> 08:28.046
to get everybody out of here,
but we need a plan.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.123
Last thing we want is a stampede.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.006
Let's start with the people we trust.
I will walkie Tom and Andrea.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.883
Have them meet us at Sweetbriar
in an hour.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.555
All right.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.893
There's finally a way out.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.725
And I don't know if we should take it.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.771
SAM:
Melanie.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.979
Sam? How are you alive?

08:52.198 --> 08:55.361
SAM: I survived the fall.
Listen, I'm not back to hurt anyone.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.027
- Especially you.
- You killed--

08:58.246 --> 09:00.202
I didn't push you into the crater
that night.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.116
- So it was Lyle?
- Yes.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.624
I helped bury you. We all did.
And then we ran.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.376
And I've regretted it every day since.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.517
Imagine if you'd trusted me
and protected the egg.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.219
Maybe none of this
would've happened.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.805
Maybe the dome
wouldn't have come down.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.232
Maybe no one would've died.
Melanie.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.813
I am so sorry, Melanie.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.276
For everything.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.526
I have a lot of unfinished business.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.237
I figured this might be
my only chance.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.578
You never know
how many chances you're gonna get.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.174
PAULINE:
Jim, what are you doing?

10:02.393 --> 10:04.384
JIM:
I was just thinking.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.724
About us.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.899
I thought maybe I'd find Junior
out here.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.573
It's exactly as it was the day I left.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.445
It was my way of keeping you alive.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.867
I used to come out here
and stare at these

10:29.087 --> 10:31.874
and try to figure out
what made you so--

10:32.090 --> 10:33.796
Crazy?

10:34.884 --> 10:35.919
--tormented.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.424
Where were you, Pauline?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.681
How did you get inside the dome?

10:44.435 --> 10:48.144
Through a cellar door
on Barbie's family property in Zenith.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.062
Barbie?
You saw Dale Barbara in Zenith?

10:50.275 --> 10:53.859
Fate, I guess.
He came back with me. And Sam.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.278
And a former student of mine
and Lyle.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.939
Except Lyle didn't make it.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.450
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.080
But why would you want
to come here?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.578
For Junior.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.166
And you.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.837
I shouldn't have run like that.
Whatever my reasons, I was wrong.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.918
No, you weren't.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.178
You were right.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.976
About the pink stars falling,

11:26.186 --> 11:28.802
about the dome,
about everything, all of it.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.436
I wasn't a good man back then.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.313
I know that.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.028
I didn't listen.
I kept pushing you away.

11:39.240 --> 11:44.405
But the dome has shown me things,
a new way to be.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.529
And now it's brought you
back to me.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.084
Pauline, I can--
I can prove to you that I've changed.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.331
Jim, I don't know.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.635
You loved me once before,
didn't you?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.811
Yes. Very much.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.849
Well, then we can be a family again.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.690
I'm gonna lead everyone out of here.

12:20.198 --> 12:24.692
And when it's over,
when you and me and Junior are out,

12:27.497 --> 12:28.828
we'll be together.

12:33.294 --> 12:37.503
I have always believed that the dome
is here to protect us. What if it still is?

12:37.715 --> 12:41.173
Maybe it started out that way, okay?
But there's barely any food left.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.501
You got no medical supplies.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.676
All of a sudden,
it's getting colder by the hour.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.880
I realize that.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.261
But Lyle didn't make it.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.219
I mean, if these people die getting out,
that's on us.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.805
What I know is,
we stay here, we die here.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.936
And what's waiting in Zenith?

12:58.152 --> 12:59.813
The playground
is under surveillance.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.281
You were interrogated, beaten.

13:02.490 --> 13:06.153
That's because they wanted the egg.
So I say this: Let's give it to them.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.245
My dad sent that video, right?
He's behind this whole thing.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.698
So my thinking is,
if we give him what he wants,

13:13.918 --> 13:15.158
maybe they leave us alone.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.167
So we leverage the egg.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.840
I go first,
and I tell them that it's theirs

13:23.052 --> 13:24.667
so long as they let the whole town
through.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.502
You come last with the egg.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.264
I have to go first.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.057
No.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.261
You're-- No.
There's no way I'm letting you do that.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.971
