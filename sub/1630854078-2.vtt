WEBVTT

00:02.254 --> 00:04.091
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:04.217 --> 00:05.637
[Esther] I don't care
what they do to me.

00:06.304 --> 00:07.807
[Janine] They're not going
to let you die.

00:08.183 --> 00:11.774
They will keep hurting you,
again and again,

00:11.857 --> 00:14.153
until you do what they say!
That is their job!

00:14.487 --> 00:18.871
Twenty-two of these women
worked with the Resistance.

00:19.455 --> 00:20.625
And you can save them.

00:20.917 --> 00:23.673
A prisoner exchange? You can't.

00:24.508 --> 00:25.593
[Rose] Did you see her?

00:26.637 --> 00:27.514
Yeah.

00:27.806 --> 00:29.935
And what she needed to do
was done?

00:30.895 --> 00:31.939
Yes.

00:32.691 --> 00:33.859
It's his wedding ring.

00:34.277 --> 00:39.245
They also sent a finger.
A severed finger.

00:39.746 --> 00:41.124
[Serena] You don't know
what she is.

00:42.001 --> 00:44.130
I'm taking my husband home
to bury him.

00:44.923 --> 00:48.471
The Waterford name has power,
and that will be respected.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.269
[June] I killed him.

00:51.436 --> 00:53.691
[prosecutor] These events
did not occur in Canada.

00:54.150 --> 00:55.903
It is not a concern
of the Crown.

00:56.947 --> 00:59.201
There can't just be
no punishment.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.289
[prosecutor] That is between

01:01.372 --> 01:04.086
you and your deity of choice,
Ms. Osborn.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.757
It's okay.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.178
[prosecutor] But the Crown
has no quarrel with you.

01:10.307 --> 01:11.518
You're free to go.

01:12.771 --> 01:14.524
I thought I'd be in jail.

01:15.484 --> 01:16.486
But you're not.

01:19.534 --> 01:20.369
No.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.043
I'm not.

02:04.373 --> 02:05.250
[imperceptible]

02:09.926 --> 02:10.845
[imperceptible]

03:44.156 --> 03:45.576
[machinery whirring]

03:46.995 --> 03:48.331
[beeping]

03:51.797 --> 03:52.799
[Mark] Okay.

03:54.051 --> 03:55.721
We're ready for you,
Mrs. Waterford.

03:57.474 --> 04:00.564
Your accommodations
have been arranged and vetted.

04:02.234 --> 04:05.323
Our security detail
will be with you at all times.

04:06.827 --> 04:10.041
And of course I'll be by
your side every step of the way.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.337
Just like you protected Fred.

04:15.928 --> 04:17.472
A lot went into arranging this.

04:20.730 --> 04:21.773
[door opens]

04:24.153 --> 04:27.451
When God calls us,
all we can do is heed him.

05:20.265 --> 05:21.685
Blessed day, Commanders.

05:22.937 --> 05:24.148
Welcome home.

05:25.191 --> 05:28.239
We thought we'd roll out
the red carpet. [chuckles]

05:32.164 --> 05:34.961
Thank you for allowing me
to bring Fred home,

05:35.253 --> 05:36.463
where he belongs.

05:37.340 --> 05:40.388
We'd never leave a brother
out in the cold.

05:41.516 --> 05:43.604
My condolences for your loss,
Mrs. Waterford.

05:48.112 --> 05:49.616
Your friends the Putnams

05:49.699 --> 05:51.828
have offered their home
for Fred's wake.

05:53.749 --> 05:54.876
How nice of them.

06:13.371 --> 06:15.501
Fred always saw
so much promise in you.

06:16.753 --> 06:17.713
Like a father.

06:19.634 --> 06:22.264
If he could see you now,
all settled,

06:23.684 --> 06:25.103
on a more fruitful path.

06:28.276 --> 06:31.281
June really did bring
so much suffering to all of us.

06:31.866 --> 06:33.160
Well, the Lord has blessed me.

06:35.164 --> 06:36.083
And you.

06:39.047 --> 06:40.509
Oh, look at us all,

06:41.343 --> 06:44.391
getting along
like friendly diplomats,

06:44.474 --> 06:45.686
trying to bury the hatchet.

06:46.688 --> 06:47.940
We'll see, hmm?

06:49.736 --> 06:50.696
We, uh...

06:52.198 --> 06:55.789
thought we would escort you
to your hotel.

06:55.914 --> 06:58.587
We thought you might
want to freshen up.

06:59.004 --> 07:01.091
I'd like to see the church
that you've selected

07:01.175 --> 07:03.179
for Fred's service if it's
not too much trouble.

07:05.099 --> 07:06.686
I think we can accommodate that.

07:31.986 --> 07:33.907
Not a popular church, I take it.

07:35.326 --> 07:36.621
Out of respect for you,

07:36.704 --> 07:38.457
we thought we'd make
Fred's funeral

07:38.667 --> 07:41.171
as quick and simple as possible.

07:42.925 --> 07:47.016
He will be laid to rest
at Granary Burial

07:47.100 --> 07:49.730
with other revolutionaries.

07:51.150 --> 07:51.985
Nice touch.

07:54.406 --> 07:57.162
We figured you'd want to
get back to Canada,

07:58.038 --> 07:59.416
move on with your life.

08:00.711 --> 08:02.255
Take in a Leafs game.

08:02.965 --> 08:04.969
I hear this might
finally be their year.

08:06.096 --> 08:07.641
I'm not much of a hockey fan.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.856
You'd love it.
It's elegant yet brutal.

08:17.327 --> 08:18.245
Hardly the farewell

08:18.329 --> 08:20.876
befitting one of the
Founding Fathers of Gilead.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.757
It's tasteful.

08:26.178 --> 08:28.725
It looked like a pack of wolves
tore into Fred.

08:30.353 --> 08:31.898
Not really the work of the Eyes.

08:33.735 --> 08:35.989
It made me wonder
what really happened to Fred.

08:37.325 --> 08:38.452
[Lawrence] I can't even imagine.

08:39.872 --> 08:41.208
We can't control
what the Americans do

08:41.291 --> 08:42.670
along the border,
Mrs. Waterford.

08:48.222 --> 08:51.395
There's only one person who
could express that kind of rage.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.315
And there's no way

08:53.399 --> 08:54.860
that she could've gotten
to Fred on her own.

09:00.664 --> 09:01.916
Could you imagine

09:02.918 --> 09:04.755
what the other
Commanders would do

09:05.841 --> 09:07.135
if they knew that

09:07.803 --> 09:10.726
you had helped a Handmaid
kill her Commander?

09:13.523 --> 09:14.609
Bold accusation.

09:16.821 --> 09:20.077
I encourage you
to give Fred a proper funeral.

09:21.496 --> 09:22.875
One that he deserves.

09:23.668 --> 09:26.089
I'm just one Commander.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.304
Nick's on the rise,

09:31.058 --> 09:33.521
but he's still a puppy.
There's only so much we can do.

09:34.272 --> 09:35.274
You'll figure it out.

09:37.111 --> 09:38.865
You're nothing
if not resourceful.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.221
[Aunt Lydia]
Even through the tragedy

09:50.555 --> 09:52.225
of Commander Waterford's death,

09:52.601 --> 09:58.445
our good Lord has found a way
to grace us with opportunity.

09:59.907 --> 10:01.994
This is your moment to shine

10:02.078 --> 10:04.750
in the sunlight
of the Spirit, girls!

10:05.627 --> 10:09.467
A chance to impress
prospective Commanders.

10:10.219 --> 10:15.062
To do his good works and to
make yourselves truly worthy.

10:16.733 --> 10:20.574
Oh, blessed be this day!

10:24.497 --> 10:25.917
I wish you were coming with me.

10:27.170 --> 10:30.468
Well, be good
and you'll be safe.

10:32.221 --> 10:34.100
Blessed be the stupid fruit.

10:35.937 --> 10:37.524
You're gonna get us in trouble.

10:44.914 --> 10:46.374
Don't you look lovely, dear.

10:47.544 --> 10:48.797
Blessed day, Aunt Lydia.

10:49.632 --> 10:51.218
May the Lord make me worthy.

10:52.428 --> 10:54.474
Be obedient and He will.

10:56.019 --> 10:57.063
Go along.

11:02.574 --> 11:03.618
Nice work, dear.

11:04.745 --> 11:05.705
Thank you.

11:05.789 --> 11:08.210
Since you have been
such a help to Esther,

11:08.628 --> 11:12.051
I will allow you to accompany
her as her minder.

11:13.136 --> 11:14.264
Thank you, Aunt Lydia!

11:14.849 --> 11:17.646
Now, the Putnams
have expressed interest

11:17.980 --> 11:19.525
in a new Handmaid.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.948
Esther is young and fertile.

11:24.242 --> 11:26.581
And, perhaps,
under your tutelage,

11:27.039 --> 11:28.375
she might impress them.

11:29.587 --> 11:30.881
She's come a long way.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.095
I hope she's ready.

11:34.972 --> 11:37.018
You both have come so far.

11:39.147 --> 11:42.529
It is my hope this time that
we can all shine together.

11:43.823 --> 11:44.783
Get yourself dressed.

11:44.867 --> 11:45.952
Oh, Aunt Lydia,

11:46.996 --> 11:48.875
do you think if the Putnams
choose Esther,

11:48.958 --> 11:51.296
that maybe I can visit her?

11:52.340 --> 11:54.720
Honey, don't get
ahead of yourself.

11:55.346 --> 11:56.557
-Okay. Yeah.
-Go get ready now.

11:57.809 --> 11:58.686
All right.

12:04.573 --> 12:06.076
[people chattering indistinctly]

12:26.659 --> 12:28.705
[indistinct chatter continues]

12:43.233 --> 12:44.653
Blessed day, Mrs. Waterford.

12:44.945 --> 12:45.905
Blessed day.

12:52.586 --> 12:53.504
Serena.

12:54.422 --> 12:56.259
Safe and sound. Praise be.

12:56.426 --> 12:57.470
Praise be.

13:05.695 --> 13:08.659
If only we were meeting
on a less sorrowful occasion.

13:09.912 --> 13:11.498
Fred was like a brother to me.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.293
Yes.

13:14.170 --> 13:16.884
The Lord always meets us
in our time of need.

13:17.051 --> 13:18.136
Mmm.

13:19.973 --> 13:20.975
Indeed.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.148
Come. We're so happy
you're here.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.371
[Commander Putnam] Mr. Tuello.

13:32.666 --> 13:33.835
Commander Putnam.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.462
Congratulations
on your promotion.

13:35.547 --> 13:37.592
I look forward
to future negotiations.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.807
Thank you. This is as far
as you go, Mr. Tuello.

13:41.349 --> 13:42.602
I'm sure you understand.

13:42.769 --> 13:46.109
According to our agreement,
I'm to accompany Mrs. Waterford.

13:47.236 --> 13:48.196
Relax, Mark.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.743
Serena is among friends.

13:57.841 --> 13:59.511
[Grace] Ah, you're so far along.

14:00.178 --> 14:02.057
Yes. Just a few more months.

14:02.349 --> 14:04.353
You're so--
Missed so much already.

14:04.437 --> 14:06.817
I wish you could stay in Gilead,

14:07.276 --> 14:08.529
and we could
make up for lost time.

14:08.613 --> 14:09.573
If He wills it.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.202
May the Lord
guide all of our paths.

14:12.829 --> 14:14.290
-Amen.
-Amen.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.461
Excuse me.

14:16.712 --> 14:18.966
I have some last-minute
funeral details to attend to.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.135
[Naomi] Of course.

14:24.561 --> 14:25.479
Well?

14:26.356 --> 14:29.236
The Council believes
that their current plan

14:29.320 --> 14:31.074
for the funeral
is more than adequate.

14:32.577 --> 14:33.913
You didn't ask, did you?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.292
We both know how it works here.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.463
A woman's word
never trumps a man.

14:40.092 --> 14:41.512
There seems to be
a lingering feeling that,

14:41.595 --> 14:43.766
for all Fred's
admirable qualities,

14:44.559 --> 14:47.481
he was somewhat of a traitor.

14:49.318 --> 14:51.072
Blessed day, Mrs. Waterford.

15:11.237 --> 15:12.322
[sighs]

15:25.516 --> 15:26.434
[Rita] Where's June?

15:26.518 --> 15:28.146
[Moira] She's gardening
in the winter.

15:30.484 --> 15:33.824
[Rita] I, uh, did see this flyer
for real estate classes?

15:33.949 --> 15:34.868
[Moira] Mmm!

15:34.951 --> 15:37.498
Yes! A hundred... No, I totally,
I can see that on you.

15:37.582 --> 15:38.458
A hundred percent.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.170
-Real estate mogul!
-[Rita] Stop.

15:40.295 --> 15:41.590
[Rita and Moira laughing]

15:42.132 --> 15:43.093
-Hey, sorry.
-Hey, June.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.053
[Rita] Hey.

15:44.513 --> 15:47.184
I got caught up
on the gardening thing.

15:47.977 --> 15:49.564
[Rita] It's okay.
It's nice to see you.

15:49.689 --> 15:52.111
All right,
who's ready to party hard?

15:52.194 --> 15:53.488
I call Twister.

15:53.572 --> 15:55.785
[Moira] Tw... [scoffs]
Stop playin'.

15:55.868 --> 15:57.496
[Rita] Ooh, Monopoly!

15:57.789 --> 15:59.835
-[Moira] You cannot do that!
-[Rita] 'Kay.

16:02.674 --> 16:05.220
[Luke] No, we're not
playing Monopoly.

16:05.303 --> 16:06.222
[Moira] Why?

16:06.305 --> 16:10.021
[Luke] Because you always get
upset when we play Monopoly.

16:10.147 --> 16:12.401
[Moira] See, now,
see that is step-- No.

16:12.527 --> 16:14.280
[Luke] You do.
You take it too far.

16:14.488 --> 16:16.869
And I just want a nice,
a nice evening so...

16:21.169 --> 16:23.214
[Moira] How 'bout
I roll the dice?

16:23.298 --> 16:24.676
See who goes first?

16:24.759 --> 16:26.429
[Rita]
Like a Monopoly-style race.

16:35.197 --> 16:37.451
-You okay?
-Yeah.

16:39.413 --> 16:41.627
[Moira] Oh, look. You can,
uh, wear this top hat

16:41.710 --> 16:43.338
when you go to the ballet.

16:43.421 --> 16:44.298
-Okay.
-[bell dings]

16:44.381 --> 16:46.052
Oh, that's the bread.
I'll be right back.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.221
-Quick, quick.
-Don't touch my money.

16:47.304 --> 16:48.139
[Moira] I got a one.

16:48.223 --> 16:50.770
It's when you roll the one,
it means you're number one.

16:50.853 --> 16:52.565
[Luke] You don't get to
just make up the rules.

16:52.649 --> 16:54.903
[Moira] I'm not making up
the rules. You just said...

16:55.655 --> 16:57.407
Like, I'm not making up
the rules.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.080
[Luke] All right. That's what
I gotta beat, a one?

17:00.163 --> 17:01.708
[Rita] It needs
a few minutes to cool.

17:01.792 --> 17:03.169
[June] No worries. Hey.

17:05.257 --> 17:06.760
You know she went back
to Gilead, right?

17:07.386 --> 17:08.388
Serena?

17:10.267 --> 17:12.354
-What's her plan?
-I don't know.

17:14.149 --> 17:17.532
She can't waltz back and forth
between Canada and Gilead

17:17.615 --> 17:20.203
like she's, what,
a fuckin' queen or something?

17:22.374 --> 17:23.334
Yeah.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.675
When is she going to get
what she deserves?

17:29.806 --> 17:31.225
Maybe they'll put her
on the Wall.

17:35.233 --> 17:39.283
Maybe they'll take her baby away
and make her a Handmaid

17:42.039 --> 17:43.374
and then put her on the Wall.

17:51.140 --> 17:52.769
You remember
when she slapped you?

17:53.102 --> 17:54.146
Jesus, June!

17:54.271 --> 17:56.442
Look it! I don't want to talk
about Serena.

17:56.943 --> 17:57.987
[June] But you remember, right?

17:58.071 --> 17:58.906
[Moira] June.

17:58.989 --> 18:00.534
After that fucked-up
baby shower.

18:00.701 --> 18:02.120
June, shut the fuck up!

18:03.206 --> 18:04.626
She was pissed at me

18:05.670 --> 18:06.797
but I was pregnant

18:07.632 --> 18:10.846
and so she went
and she hauled off on you.

18:10.971 --> 18:13.476
Shut up. Sh-fuck!

18:15.313 --> 18:16.315
Stop it.

18:19.196 --> 18:21.618
I may not have been a Handmaid
but I struggle too.

18:24.248 --> 18:25.333
I struggle every day.

18:26.377 --> 18:28.256
Every fucking day.

18:35.813 --> 18:36.773
Rita, I'm sorry.

18:37.775 --> 18:38.694
Good.

18:40.865 --> 18:42.033
What the fuck is wrong with you?

18:51.093 --> 18:52.137
[breathing unsteadily]

18:57.732 --> 18:59.443
[chattering indistinctly]

19:15.768 --> 19:16.603
[door opens]

19:23.115 --> 19:24.076
Commander Blaine.

19:30.421 --> 19:31.298
[Mark] Hello.

19:32.467 --> 19:33.344
Blessed day.

19:34.179 --> 19:35.975
Blessed day, Aunt...

19:37.728 --> 19:38.647
Lydia.

19:39.439 --> 19:40.441
Praise be.

19:45.828 --> 19:46.871
Go on now.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.042
Keep a sharp eye.

19:58.729 --> 19:59.647
[exhales]

20:00.315 --> 20:03.947
The Lord's light shines
through the most righteous.

20:05.826 --> 20:07.622
Blessed day, Mrs. Putnam.

20:09.626 --> 20:10.669
Mrs. Waterford.

20:11.588 --> 20:13.341
I am so sorry for your loss.

20:14.343 --> 20:15.303
Thank you.

20:17.600 --> 20:22.067
And yet, the Lord has made
His countenance shine upon you.

20:24.697 --> 20:27.077
I'm just grateful to be
an instrument in His plan.

20:28.412 --> 20:29.331
Ah.

20:29.874 --> 20:31.753
Well, you are a...

20:34.216 --> 20:35.970
marvel, Mrs. Waterford.

20:37.472 --> 20:39.434
Mrs. Putnam, please follow me.

20:45.446 --> 20:48.369
-[girl crying]
-[Martha] Angela! Come here!

20:50.582 --> 20:52.168
We're finally
out of that stupid gym

20:52.252 --> 20:53.337
and we're just standing around.

20:55.216 --> 20:56.343
We have to do something.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.640
Anyone who does something
ends up dead.

20:59.349 --> 21:00.309
Or worse.

21:01.311 --> 21:02.732
The smartest thing
to do is just...

21:04.151 --> 21:06.155
Just follow the rules
and stay alive.

21:06.488 --> 21:08.660
Trust me. Here we go.

21:13.503 --> 21:16.050
Mrs. Putnam, this is Esther.

21:27.823 --> 21:28.867
She's so young.

21:31.455 --> 21:32.958
And I heard
she used to be a Wife.

21:34.879 --> 21:39.847
Which means she understands
the respect you deserve.

21:42.978 --> 21:45.526
You have come so far,
haven't you, dear?

21:47.195 --> 21:48.114
Yes, Aunt Lydia.

21:49.074 --> 21:49.909
By His Grace.

21:55.169 --> 21:56.421
-Fine.
-Ah!

21:57.758 --> 21:58.885
Come along, dear.

22:01.348 --> 22:05.106
Remember, mind your manners
and all will be well.

22:06.233 --> 22:07.318
[clears throat]

22:09.155 --> 22:10.199
[exhales]

22:11.828 --> 22:13.080
[Martha] Angela,
come back here!

22:14.124 --> 22:15.836
-[Naomi] Angela, sweetie!
-Hi!

22:16.128 --> 22:18.007
-[Angela] Blessed day.
-Hi, sweet girl.

22:18.508 --> 22:19.552
Can I give you a hug?

22:19.635 --> 22:20.762
[Angela murmurs indistinctly]

22:20.846 --> 22:22.098
Okay. Okay.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.689
Okay.

22:26.023 --> 22:27.025
Thank you.

22:28.444 --> 22:29.572
Have you been having fun, huh?

22:30.156 --> 22:31.158
[Naomi clears throat]

22:31.659 --> 22:32.828
That's enough, please.

22:33.914 --> 22:36.001
Cecelia, come and get
Angela, please.

22:36.084 --> 22:37.211
Okay, okay. Here we go.

22:37.504 --> 22:39.257
Ready? Okay, go ahead, baby.

22:39.341 --> 22:40.343
-[Angela] Okay.
-Go ahead.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.073
You have a beautiful daughter,
Mrs. Putnam.

22:54.997 --> 22:56.584
I thank God for her every day.

23:02.387 --> 23:04.266
And for those
who brought her to me.

23:25.809 --> 23:26.644
Okay.

23:32.322 --> 23:33.240
Gentlemen,

23:34.159 --> 23:35.077
Praise be.

23:36.914 --> 23:38.083
Blessed be the fruit.

23:39.837 --> 23:40.922
May the Lord open.

23:43.762 --> 23:46.517
Aunt Lydia has told me
a lot about you.

23:49.314 --> 23:51.193
May God make me truly worthy.

23:51.944 --> 23:53.238
[Commander Putnam]
I am sure you will be.

23:53.322 --> 23:54.157
[Aunt Lydia chuckles]

23:55.577 --> 23:57.413
[Commander Putnam] Will you
excuse us a moment, Gentlemen?

23:59.502 --> 24:01.046
I'll join you in the pool house.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.310
You too, Aunt Lydia.

24:10.774 --> 24:11.651
I'm sorry?

24:14.030 --> 24:15.491
[Commander Putnam]
Blessed day, Aunt Lydia.

24:17.453 --> 24:18.372
Oh.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.587
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

24:27.431 --> 24:28.392
Good.

24:33.318 --> 24:34.864
[breathing unsteadily]

24:42.880 --> 24:43.840
[door closes]

24:49.184 --> 24:50.478
You don't have to be scared.

24:52.941 --> 24:55.321
God sees your heart.

24:57.951 --> 25:01.458
Allow the gifts
God blessed you with

25:02.460 --> 25:04.715
to be seen by all others.

25:08.515 --> 25:09.558
[chuckles]

25:09.975 --> 25:12.648
That just means I want to
get to know you a little better.

25:15.069 --> 25:16.196
[chuckles softly]

25:17.574 --> 25:18.576
Praise be.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.586
You care for a chocolate?

25:38.282 --> 25:39.367
[imitates motor noises]

25:52.435 --> 25:53.437
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

25:58.113 --> 25:59.658
[making urging noises]

26:04.752 --> 26:05.712
[makes urging noises]

26:15.523 --> 26:17.652
[humming teasingly]

26:31.471 --> 26:32.306
You all right?

26:37.609 --> 26:38.569
Um...

26:40.990 --> 26:41.992
Yeah.

26:42.828 --> 26:43.996
I gotta tell you something.

26:53.516 --> 26:56.062
Serena knows I killed Fred.

26:59.110 --> 27:00.237
How could she know that?

27:01.281 --> 27:03.661
I did something.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.671
I sent her a finger.

27:12.637 --> 27:14.015
It was Fred's finger.

27:15.434 --> 27:16.269
What?

27:18.983 --> 27:20.319
I cut it off of him.

27:24.202 --> 27:25.120
[chuckles]

27:31.800 --> 27:33.679
'Cause I wanted her to know
it was me.

27:35.642 --> 27:39.065
Do you want her to come after us
and our family?

27:39.148 --> 27:40.150
No.

27:40.234 --> 27:43.908
But I know her and I know
what she's capable of.

27:43.991 --> 27:45.327
And I know she has a plan.

27:45.410 --> 27:47.164
-This is what she's doing--
-Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

27:47.248 --> 27:49.043
You're obsessing over her!

27:50.045 --> 27:52.341
You... You sent her a finger!

27:53.636 --> 27:55.723
How is that gonna
help our family?

27:55.807 --> 27:57.226
How is that gonna help you?

27:58.353 --> 28:00.357
That is not gonna get
Hannah back.

28:04.323 --> 28:05.242
I know!

28:10.503 --> 28:12.006
You don't think I know that?

28:14.468 --> 28:15.680
I know that.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.795
-June?
-What?

28:32.797 --> 28:35.637
You gotta be here.
You gotta be right here.

28:36.387 --> 28:38.224
All right?
Because I need you here

28:38.308 --> 28:41.774
and Nichole needs you here.

28:43.653 --> 28:45.489
Your family needs you...

28:46.366 --> 28:47.201
here.

28:47.284 --> 28:48.203
And if you're not,

28:48.286 --> 28:49.956
I don't know
what's gonna happen, June...

28:51.835 --> 28:52.921
to us.

29:01.479 --> 29:02.439
I'm sorry.

29:04.736 --> 29:05.738
It...

29:08.619 --> 29:09.871
Fuck. I'm sorry.

29:13.128 --> 29:17.052
She's gone, all right?

29:17.971 --> 29:19.725
She's probably terrified of you.

29:21.144 --> 29:22.146
-Yeah.
-Right?

29:22.479 --> 29:24.860
You know?
'Cause you won, you're here.

29:26.446 --> 29:27.866
She can't get to you.

29:29.493 --> 29:30.872
-Yeah.
-All right?

29:30.955 --> 29:34.378
So, you gotta let go of her.

29:34.755 --> 29:36.424
Forget about her. Fuck her.

29:37.301 --> 29:38.386
Yeah.

29:40.933 --> 29:41.852
Okay.

29:42.854 --> 29:43.898
Fuck her.

29:47.697 --> 29:48.616
Fuck her.

30:00.263 --> 30:01.265
Fuck her.

30:10.450 --> 30:11.537
[exhales]

30:18.216 --> 30:20.095
[people chattering indistinctly]

30:26.148 --> 30:27.359
[breathing unsteadily]

30:33.204 --> 30:34.331
[Calhoun] Mrs. Waterford.

30:35.543 --> 30:36.670
What a surprise.

30:38.966 --> 30:40.093
Commander Calhoun.

30:41.220 --> 30:42.849
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

30:43.057 --> 30:43.976
[door opening]

30:52.451 --> 30:54.581
[Calhoun] Is there something
we can help you with?

30:57.670 --> 31:00.467
I was hoping to speak with you
on behalf of my husband.

31:09.485 --> 31:13.159
Fred dedicated his life
to this great nation.

31:15.288 --> 31:17.376
Thank you
for honoring his legacy.

31:18.754 --> 31:20.465
You're welcome, Mrs. Waterford.

31:24.014 --> 31:27.522
I would like for my unborn son
to be proud of his father.

31:28.314 --> 31:29.651
And for people to see

31:30.235 --> 31:32.364
what you gentlemen here
have created,

31:34.118 --> 31:35.495
God's Kingdom on Earth.

31:39.211 --> 31:42.217
Perhaps it's time that
we show Gilead to the world.

31:44.764 --> 31:45.850
Now, I've been to Canada.

31:45.933 --> 31:47.310
I know what they think of us.

31:48.396 --> 31:50.358
If we are to be respected,

31:50.483 --> 31:52.070
I think we need to show them

31:52.154 --> 31:55.035
that we grieve
just like they do.

31:55.953 --> 31:59.501
I think we need to make Fred's
funeral an international event,

31:59.961 --> 32:01.548
broadcast across the globe.

32:03.844 --> 32:07.392
Mrs. Waterford, the, uh,
stress you've been under

32:07.476 --> 32:10.482
would unmoor anyone,

32:11.735 --> 32:13.071
especially in your condition.

32:13.488 --> 32:15.743
[Lawrence] We've shown
the world our fist.

32:16.787 --> 32:19.584
It's time
to show them our humanity.

32:20.293 --> 32:21.755
[Commander Putnam]
Why should we listen to you?

32:22.255 --> 32:24.301
You don't even adhere
to our way of life.

32:25.386 --> 32:28.894
You have no wife,
no child, no family.

32:30.606 --> 32:31.650
Thank you, uh,

32:32.275 --> 32:34.404
Commander Putnam,
for reminding me

32:34.488 --> 32:37.410
of the untimely passing
of my wife.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.291
Let's not be hasty, Warren.

32:41.878 --> 32:43.799
Doesn't hurt
to hear all the details.

32:46.555 --> 32:47.974
I've watched you gentlemen

32:48.266 --> 32:51.147
squander one opportunity
after another

32:51.438 --> 32:54.403
that could've led
to more prosperity.

32:54.486 --> 32:58.244
The public mourning
of one of our peers

32:58.369 --> 33:01.000
is an opportunity
we cannot waste.

33:01.417 --> 33:03.045
But a traitor's funeral

33:04.214 --> 33:05.843
for all the world to see?

33:06.343 --> 33:07.513
How will that make us look?

33:08.932 --> 33:09.809
[Nick] Merciful.

33:11.646 --> 33:13.024
We'll look merciful.

33:16.990 --> 33:18.994
I served Commander Waterford
for many years.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.710
He wasn't perfect.

33:26.593 --> 33:28.429
But the least we can do
is honor the sacrifices

33:28.513 --> 33:29.724
he made to our nation.

33:31.978 --> 33:33.899
Sacrifices that yielded
a miracle.

33:36.529 --> 33:39.076
Barren woman made fruitful
by His grace.

33:40.286 --> 33:44.378
And a symbol
that could accelerate

33:44.629 --> 33:46.841
the international acceptance
of Gilead

33:48.135 --> 33:51.100
so that we can finally
take our rightful place

33:51.643 --> 33:53.271
among the nations of the world.

33:54.899 --> 33:57.863
Well, if you will excuse us,
Mrs. Waterford,

33:57.947 --> 34:00.911
we have official business
to discuss.

34:22.037 --> 34:23.497
[murmuring indistinctly]

34:34.771 --> 34:36.148
I don't want to get posted.

34:37.025 --> 34:38.194
[exhales]

34:39.572 --> 34:42.494
Get your Commander to like you,
you'll get pregnant faster.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.255
Do you really think that being
pregnant is gonna protect me?

34:48.799 --> 34:50.426
It's your only protection.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.460
Sure.

35:17.732 --> 35:18.900
[Mark exhales]

35:19.861 --> 35:21.321
Least you can say you tried.

35:25.079 --> 35:27.250
The worst they can do is say no.

35:33.387 --> 35:35.183
[sighs] Have you got
a cigarette?

35:47.625 --> 35:48.919
[knocking at door]

36:02.403 --> 36:04.282
I got them to say yes.

36:07.413 --> 36:10.086
-How?
-By not being a woman.

36:22.778 --> 36:24.824
-I'll leave you both to it.
-Great.

36:28.330 --> 36:30.167
Well, I'd like to immediately

36:30.251 --> 36:31.504
start talking
about the guest list.

36:32.005 --> 36:32.881
Why not?

36:33.257 --> 36:35.679
I think it's important
that we invite

36:35.762 --> 36:36.889
Commanders from out of town.

36:38.434 --> 36:40.187
-Any in particular?
-Yes.

36:40.897 --> 36:42.442
-Commander Johnson.
-Mmm-hmm.

36:43.444 --> 36:44.446
Davidson,

36:45.156 --> 36:46.576
uh, Commander Scott.

37:12.210 --> 37:13.253
[car door opens]

37:29.077 --> 37:30.079
I'll take it from here.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.248
Yes, Sir.

37:35.131 --> 37:36.968
I was wondering
if we'd get to talk.

37:39.222 --> 37:40.266
How is she?

37:42.478 --> 37:44.775
That file you pulled together
for her was good.

37:47.948 --> 37:48.867
And Nichole?

37:50.161 --> 37:51.413
She's well cared for.

37:56.924 --> 37:58.093
You've risen fast,

37:58.720 --> 38:00.849
while somehow
managing to help June.

38:03.646 --> 38:04.857
That takes talent.

38:05.191 --> 38:06.819
To fly under the radar
like that.

38:08.823 --> 38:11.286
Just trying to stay
out of trouble.

38:16.213 --> 38:18.050
Wouldn't you like to see
your daughter in person

38:18.133 --> 38:19.595
rather than asking about her?

38:21.306 --> 38:22.475
That's a pipe dream.

38:23.561 --> 38:25.231
I know you got
a complicated past.

38:27.694 --> 38:30.032
But America can be
a very forgiving place.

38:32.286 --> 38:33.581
If you make amends,

38:34.792 --> 38:36.336
gain us some visibility,

38:37.255 --> 38:38.800
play your part for a while.

38:41.681 --> 38:44.728
I'd like to help you
and your daughter.

38:45.981 --> 38:47.066
If you'll let me.

38:49.362 --> 38:50.532
We could help each other.

38:55.917 --> 38:56.836
I'll remember that.

39:02.890 --> 39:04.142
[radio chattering indistinctly]

40:42.756 --> 40:43.716
I don't know.

40:47.641 --> 40:48.810
It must be hard...

40:51.439 --> 40:52.526
seeing your daughter

40:54.404 --> 40:55.782
and having to leave her behind.

40:59.706 --> 41:00.750
You get used to it.

41:02.336 --> 41:03.380
Unfortunately.

41:10.770 --> 41:12.440
I stole some
from the Putnam house.

41:14.695 --> 41:15.572
I mean,

41:16.448 --> 41:18.410
one little rebellion won't hurt.

41:20.874 --> 41:22.418
We'll keep it between us.

41:24.255 --> 41:25.257
[gasps excitedly]

41:38.868 --> 41:40.329
I know it's weird,

41:42.082 --> 41:43.126
but having a baby...

41:44.505 --> 41:46.216
it's the most incredible thing.

41:47.468 --> 41:50.808
Tiny feet and hands
grew inside me.

41:52.019 --> 41:53.188
It's wild! It's...

41:58.991 --> 42:02.331
it's the most complete love
you'll ever know.

42:09.596 --> 42:11.642
Even if someone else
is raising her.

42:23.415 --> 42:25.419
They treat you the best
when you're pregnant.

42:26.296 --> 42:27.549
It's like a princess.

42:31.097 --> 42:31.932
Yeah.

42:33.602 --> 42:34.688
No. I bet they do.

42:39.906 --> 42:40.867
I'm gonna miss you.

42:43.789 --> 42:46.085
Maybe Aunt Lydia will
let us be walking partners.

42:49.676 --> 42:50.637
Maybe.

43:00.531 --> 43:01.407
You know,

43:03.579 --> 43:05.833
I really didn't like you
when we first met.

43:08.798 --> 43:10.050
[laughs] Yeah.

43:16.522 --> 43:17.941
And I was right the first time.

43:21.447 --> 43:22.449
[Janine] What?

43:23.869 --> 43:24.788
Why?

43:27.209 --> 43:28.128
You...

43:31.552 --> 43:32.804
You don't care about me.

43:36.729 --> 43:38.649
You just wanted to see
your daughter, right?

43:40.110 --> 43:41.154
[Janine exhales]

43:41.404 --> 43:42.741
No, you lied to me.

43:46.205 --> 43:47.207
You used me.

43:48.418 --> 43:49.420
Like Aunt Lydia.

43:52.092 --> 43:53.094
Like they all do.

43:56.142 --> 43:57.227
And you're one of them.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.693
Esther, I was trying
to help you survive.

44:01.444 --> 44:02.864
Like June helped me.

44:04.116 --> 44:05.118
You're not June.

44:06.454 --> 44:07.790
You know, you're a disgrace.

44:10.420 --> 44:13.218
And I fucking hate you.

44:15.765 --> 44:16.683
[Esther gasps]

44:18.687 --> 44:20.440
[coughing]

44:21.902 --> 44:23.238
[Janine] Oh, my God, Esther.

44:24.616 --> 44:25.660
[coughing]

44:26.494 --> 44:28.331
Now we're gonna make June proud.

44:30.545 --> 44:32.172
[coughing]

44:32.924 --> 44:34.051
Esther? What happened?

44:35.178 --> 44:37.224
Help! Help!

44:40.773 --> 44:41.984
[retching]

44:44.280 --> 44:46.702
-What did you do?
-[both coughing]

44:48.747 --> 44:50.835
What did you do? Help, someone!

44:52.129 --> 44:54.634
-[both coughing]
-Somebody, help!

44:55.176 --> 44:56.220
[Aunt Lydia] What happened?

44:56.470 --> 44:57.515
[both coughing]

44:57.599 --> 44:59.393
What happened? No!

44:59.811 --> 45:02.107
Janine! Janine, what happened?

45:02.190 --> 45:03.401
No, no! No!

45:03.527 --> 45:04.905
Oh, God! No!

45:05.488 --> 45:08.244
No, darling, come here.
No, no, no! Janine!

45:08.746 --> 45:10.415
Janine, no, no!
Look at me, dear.

45:10.498 --> 45:13.881
No! Help us! Someone!
Sit 'em up.

45:13.964 --> 45:16.093
No, sweetheart, no, no, no.

45:16.177 --> 45:20.435
No, no, honey!
No! Help us! Oh, God, no!

45:46.571 --> 45:47.532
[sniffles]

45:54.086 --> 45:55.130
[sobbing]

46:21.558 --> 46:22.560
[door opens]

46:39.886 --> 46:42.349
Take as much time as you need.
They can wait.

46:43.309 --> 46:44.269
[Serena] I'm ready.

47:08.569 --> 47:09.444
[church bell tolling]

47:10.739 --> 47:12.743
[classical music playing]

48:15.536 --> 48:16.955
[music flourishes]

48:28.729 --> 48:29.981
[church bell tolling]

48:48.100 --> 48:50.104
[classical music
continues playing]

49:11.648 --> 49:13.652
[classical music
continues playing]

49:58.575 --> 50:00.579
[classical music
continues playing]

50:46.796 --> 50:48.758
[classical music
continues playing]

52:09.545 --> 52:10.379
[music stops]

52:10.463 --> 52:11.966
[people chattering indistinctly]

52:13.260 --> 52:14.930
So, uh...

52:16.266 --> 52:18.479
what do you think the chances
are of having a second date?

52:18.563 --> 52:20.650
[chuckles] Whoa, back off!

52:20.859 --> 52:23.155
Yeah, yeah. I'm always
a bit forward, right?

52:23.238 --> 52:25.075
-Yeah, just a little fast.
-[laughs]

52:26.411 --> 52:28.081
Mmm. Take you home?

52:28.165 --> 52:29.292
Yeah. We should go.

52:31.547 --> 52:32.925
-Ready?
-Ready.

52:34.637 --> 52:35.639
[June] ...more than anything.

52:35.722 --> 52:37.391
-[Luke] One-track mind.
-[June laughs]

53:23.233 --> 53:24.360
What the fuck?
