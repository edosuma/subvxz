00:38.081 --> 00:41.083
What is it?

00:41.084 --> 00:42.998
I don't really know.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.435
I just...

00:45.436 --> 00:48.265
I can't stop thinking about
what happened with us.

00:50.267 --> 00:53.661
- Do you know what they call it?
- Mmmm.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.446
Stockholm Syndrome.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.667
What do you
got to do to get that?

00:59.668 --> 01:01.625
Be kidnapped?

01:01.626 --> 01:04.584
- Held hostage, or something?
- Yeah.

01:04.586 --> 01:05.586
And then what?

01:07.589 --> 01:09.460
And you fall for your captor.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.073
So they say.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.753
My name is Kaj Hannson.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.279
My name is Kaj Hannson.

02:06.474 --> 02:07.996
I'm the outlaw.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.117

over this bridge, man,

02:42.118 --> 02:43.423

02:43.424 --> 02:45.729
Are you here for

Hold on, hold on, hold on.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.488
Oh. Let me get that for you.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.620
Thank you, son. Uh-huh.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.969
Ooh.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.151
Is that all of your deposits?

04:00.152 --> 04:02.458
Yes, and I would
like a monthly statement.

04:05.157 --> 04:08.290
Let's see here,
cock this bastard.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.511
And Whoooo-aaahh!

04:11.512 --> 04:12.729
Giddy-up!

04:12.730 --> 04:14.383
Woo!

04:14.384 --> 04:15.471
Get on the ground!

04:15.472 --> 04:17.647
You, you, on the ground!

04:26.918 --> 04:28.920
The party has begun.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.619
Alright.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.577
You, stand up. Stand up, huh?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.450
Tie her up, tie her
up, hands and feet.

04:38.539 --> 04:41.497
What are, what are you
do, what are you doing?

04:41.498 --> 04:42.456
What the fuck.

04:42.457 --> 04:43.847
Are you doing? Huh?

04:43.848 --> 04:46.023
Hey, did you just
set off the alarm?

04:46.024 --> 04:47.982
Did you just set off the alarm?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.289
Yes.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.943
That's very good.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.554
Now sit down.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.033
Sit down.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.689
Call the Chief of Police, okay?

04:59.690 --> 05:01.648
Do you understand me? Yes.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.432
Alright. Help!

05:03.433 --> 05:04.868
Why, what, what?

05:04.869 --> 05:06.522
Who said that?

05:06.523 --> 05:08.132
What's wrong, what's wrong?

05:08.133 --> 05:10.221
Oh, c'mon, where's,
where's the bank manager?

05:10.222 --> 05:12.702
Who's, who's the bank manager?

05:12.703 --> 05:14.314
Davin. Davin!

05:16.054 --> 05:17.403
Has she been shot?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.969
No, she hasn't been shot.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.667
She's obviously got a
muscle cramp or something.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.799
Get her a banana and
get everybody out!

05:22.800 --> 05:23.887
C'mon, go!

05:23.888 --> 05:25.585
Go, go, yes, go! Please stand,

05:25.586 --> 05:27.717
slowly make your
way to the exits.

05:27.718 --> 05:28.762
Remain

05:28.763 --> 05:30.111
calm.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.373
Please, please.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.375
Did you get him on the line?

05:33.376 --> 05:34.811
Wa, waiting. You're waiting?

05:34.812 --> 05:37.161
Here we are.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.512
It's all for a good
cause, ladies, huh?

05:39.513 --> 05:42.297
Chief, there's an emer...
Hold that bloody thought.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.386
There, ah?

05:44.387 --> 05:47.781
An American with a machine
gun has taken over Kreditbank.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.479
Kreditbank?

05:50.480 --> 05:53.787
This is Bianca
Lind at Kreditbank.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.529
Um, there, there's an
American with a big gun.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.704
Yeah, yeah.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.140
Is anyone else hurt there?

05:59.141 --> 06:01.882
Ah, my, my colleague is tied up.

06:01.883 --> 06:02.883
No, No. And...

06:02.884 --> 06:04.363
Ask him what he wants?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.929
He's asking what you want?

06:05.930 --> 06:06.930
Tell him that I want him.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.367
Right now, I want him here

06:08.368 --> 06:09.325
in 10 minutes or I
shoot you in the face.

06:09.326 --> 06:11.021
And then hang up, tell him that.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.422
He wants you here in ten minutes
or he shoots me in the face.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.771
Was he surprised?

06:21.772 --> 06:23.338
I mean, did he sound surprised?

06:23.339 --> 06:25.166
I mean,

06:25.167 --> 06:26.994
fuck, right?

06:26.995 --> 06:30.389
I just robbed the
biggest bank in Sweden.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.304
I mean, he's gonna be surprised.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.873
Eck.

06:40.791 --> 06:41.791
What do you want?

06:50.497 --> 06:52.411
Tie her up.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.763
Oh, please.

06:57.591 --> 06:58.939
Please, I have children.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.028
Uh, stop.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.899
Do not fuck with me.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.423
Okay?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.728
Behind the back.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.469
Tie her hands up
behind the back.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.167
Do not give me those eyes.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.912
C'mon, get outta here!

07:15.913 --> 07:18.088
Done with you, you two,
get, go, go, go, go!

07:18.089 --> 07:19.916
Are we okay?

07:19.917 --> 07:21.091
Police! He has a gun!

07:21.092 --> 07:23.093
Police!

07:23.094 --> 07:25.614
There's, there's a crazy man in there.
He was gonna kill us all.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.630
Our Social
Democratic Prime Minister.

07:37.631 --> 07:41.024
Olof Palme is a fierce
critic of Nixon and Vietnam.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.252
Ah, hey, stop, freeze.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.732
What is wrong with you?

07:52.733 --> 07:54.734
You could have
taken her head off!

07:54.735 --> 07:56.170
Is there anymore of you?

07:56.171 --> 07:57.171
No, easy, easy. Huh? Tough guy?

07:57.172 --> 07:58.564
Easy. Huh?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.391
You are so lucky I don't
blow your brains out!

08:00.392 --> 08:02.002
Goddamn! Hey, just relax.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.786
Oh, I'm gonna get...
Sit down, sit down!

08:03.787 --> 08:05.484
Get in there, sit down!

08:05.485 --> 08:06.485
Okay, okay, whoa.

08:08.226 --> 08:11.098
Sit down!

08:11.099 --> 08:12.795
Did you see that,
I shot the gun,

08:12.796 --> 08:16.190
boom, right out of his
hand! Ha, right there.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.063
Now you have to
stop crying, okay?

08:20.064 --> 08:21.978
It's making me really,
really nervous.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.416
You got to sit down right,
right in that chair, okay?

08:27.550 --> 08:29.378
Okay, I'll sit here.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.119
And keep my eyes on the door.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.424
Okay.

08:34.861 --> 08:36.340
Where's my hat?

08:36.341 --> 08:37.995
Get my hat, it's
right over there.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.953
Yeah.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.259
Thank you.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.433
Give me the radio, too.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.958
Let's have some music.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.003
Ah, yeah, just sit
it right there.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.483
Now, get, get outta here.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.094
You, you get the
fuck outta here.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.372
The Chief has arrived.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.896
It is on now.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.071
I got an idea.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.507
Let me see the walkie, c'mon.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.988
Where's the walkie? Hmm? C'mon.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.555
Okay, here, thank you.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.730
Sing this.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.035
What you don't like Dylan?

09:19.036 --> 09:20.602
Huh?

09:20.603 --> 09:22.169
What kind of cop
doesn't like Dylan?

09:22.170 --> 09:24.084
What kind of person
doesn't like Dylan?

09:24.085 --> 09:25.085
Sing!

09:40.188 --> 09:42.406
Now we're getting somewhere.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.799
Bloody Americans.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.019
Why can't they just stay home?

09:46.020 --> 09:47.977
Set up on the second
floor, let's go.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.893
We're gonna use
the bank offices.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.680
Stay active, morning gentlemen.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.769
We don't have time
to waste, that's it.

10:04.995 --> 10:08.695
The first
ever hostage crisis in Sweden.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.045
Are we live?

10:12.046 --> 10:13.307
We're live.

10:16.485 --> 10:17.920
Alright everybody.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.096
This is Chief Mattsson.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.621
- Get down, get down.
- Coming out.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.231
You better not be armed!

10:24.232 --> 10:26.016
No, no, no, not armed.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.410
What's your name?

10:30.673 --> 10:32.674
You can call me

10:32.675 --> 10:34.720
the Outlaw, huh?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.939
Remember the Alamo.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.246
Woo!

10:39.987 --> 10:41.465
You alright, Vinter?

10:41.466 --> 10:42.510
What happened? Oh, oh,

10:42.511 --> 10:43.816
you worried about the cop?

10:43.817 --> 10:45.556
Ah, how 'bout that
you guys, huh?

10:45.557 --> 10:47.297
First thing he wants to
know is how the cop is!

10:47.298 --> 10:48.777
Don't worry about him!

10:48.778 --> 10:50.431
Get outta here, huh,
we're done with you now.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.868
Get outta here,
huh, go on beat it.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.437
Beat it, you heard me.
Oh, God, we're done with you.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.006
Get to the hospital.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.529
I'm not leaving.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.400
Hey, you guys
having a drink or what?

11:03.401 --> 11:04.664
You wanna talk to him or me?

11:06.535 --> 11:08.841
I would like to
talk with Ms. Lind.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.581
She here?

11:10.582 --> 11:12.410
Yeah, she's fine,
stand up, stand up.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.066
Is that you?

11:17.938 --> 11:19.460
Where are the others?

11:19.461 --> 11:21.114
I'm doing the talking.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.550
Alright?

11:22.551 --> 11:25.684
Bring me Gunnar Sorensson.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.424
Now.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.470
Gunnar Sorensson?

11:29.471 --> 11:30.558
That's right.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.255
From Kalmar Prison.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.127
We can't do that.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.519
Let me tell you,

11:35.520 --> 11:38.174
What you can and
cannot do, alright?

11:38.175 --> 11:40.699
Listen to me,
just walk, just walk.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.745
Alright. Nice and easy, get
down, real easy, I mean easy.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.269
Bring me Gunnar Sorennsson

11:46.270 --> 11:49.011
by 3 p.m.,

11:49.012 --> 11:51.013
or I'm gonna shoot
her in the head, okay?

11:51.014 --> 11:53.363
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy,

11:53.364 --> 11:56.410
you don't want to do that.
You don't want to hurt her.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.977
Now you've come to a bank.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.674
You want money?

11:59.675 --> 12:01.371
That's right, money.

12:01.372 --> 12:02.503
Right, I want

12:02.504 --> 12:04.505
one million.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.549
US dollars

12:05.550 --> 12:06.812
un-marked.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.248
You hear me?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.206
American? That'll
take some time to...

12:10.207 --> 12:11.642
And I want two pistols,

12:11.643 --> 12:13.688
and a getaway car and
bulletproof vests,

12:13.689 --> 12:15.690
for, for the hostages, too.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.953
That's a little one sided.

12:17.954 --> 12:21.000
And who is this hostage,
just you, cowboy?

12:21.001 --> 12:23.480
Me and Gunnar, you get it?

12:23.481 --> 12:26.005
We will let the ladies
go when it's over.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.441
When we're free.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.965
I'll talk with the Ministry.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.750
Give us a few hours.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.102
I thought I was talking to
somebody with some authority?

12:36.712 --> 12:38.758
I thought I was talking
to a bank robber?

12:44.981 --> 12:47.113
Better not see
any cops on this floor.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.505
Huh?

12:48.506 --> 12:49.637
I'm gonna be upstairs.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.205
You alright?

12:52.336 --> 12:54.163
C'mon.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.817
Bring those mics please.

13:01.693 --> 13:04.130
Only if you
have a clear shot, right?

13:04.131 --> 13:05.219
Yes, I understand.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.482
Everybody behind the line.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.614
Step back, everybody.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.229
How do you know
Gunnar Sorensson?

13:16.230 --> 13:18.666
Oh, everybody
knows Gunnar Sorensson.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.060
He's the greatest bank
robber in the whole world.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.893
Didn't he kill someone?

13:27.894 --> 13:32.201
Listen, it's a couple
hour drive from Kalmar,

13:32.202 --> 13:33.681
hmm?

13:33.682 --> 13:36.466
I brought us a cribbage
board, some cards.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.338
I don't have any red pegs,

13:38.339 --> 13:41.297
but I have some matchsticks
that we can use.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.039
Alright? Do you play cribbage?

13:44.867 --> 13:47.347
I have to pee.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.348
I don't wanna die.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.050
Let me take her to a restroom.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.531
Do I look like an idiot?

13:57.967 --> 13:59.360
Have some decency.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.845
Okay, I mean one of
you can go at a time,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.237
but if you don't come back,

14:08.238 --> 14:09.457
I'll shoot the other one.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.808
C'mon, Klara, you go.

14:13.809 --> 14:16.289
You go, if you have to.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.900
I do, but you go on.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.816
No, I don't trust myself.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.516
Alright, then,
then I'll go first.

14:29.390 --> 14:32.087
Will you untie my hands?

14:41.141 --> 14:42.533
Now listen.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.536
I just wanna make sure
you come back, okay?

14:46.537 --> 14:48.190
She's not as strong as you.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.504
Come back now, ya hear?

15:32.801 --> 15:34.716
Oh.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.406
Did you think about leaving me?

16:45.134 --> 16:47.179
Okay, come with me.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.007
- It's him, it's him.
- Mr. Sorensson?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.878
Mr. Sorensson,
why have you been released?

16:50.879 --> 16:52.227
Mr. Sorensson,
who is in the bank?

16:52.228 --> 16:53.272
There is nothing to say.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.056
Keep moving.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.623
- Keep moving.
- Give a statement!

16:56.624 --> 16:58.304
Why are you here, Mr. Sorensson?

16:58.887 --> 17:00.584
Is that mine? Ok.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.282
You went?

17:08.549 --> 17:11.942
I'm coming out with
Gunnar Sorensson!

17:11.943 --> 17:13.683
He's agreed to

17:13.684 --> 17:15.032
help us.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.122
Negotiate.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.431
Yes, yes, yes.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.218
You know this guy?

17:26.262 --> 17:28.002
I'm not sure yet.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.487
Let us have one
hostage for Gunnar, huh?

17:34.488 --> 17:36.358
You keep forgetting

17:36.359 --> 17:38.839
that I am the one
making the demands.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.321
I see Gunnar, I don't
see my car, huh?

17:43.149 --> 17:44.149
Is it you?

17:47.022 --> 17:48.414
Next time I see you,

17:48.415 --> 17:51.765
I want you to be puttin'
keys to a Mustang 302

17:51.766 --> 17:54.811
like Steve McQueen had
in Bullitt, understood?

17:54.812 --> 17:56.552
Oh, yeah.

17:56.553 --> 17:57.901
I like that movie.

17:57.902 --> 17:58.902
Yeah.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.738
I did it!

18:08.739 --> 18:09.826
Yeah!

18:09.827 --> 18:11.176
You're free, hah!

18:11.177 --> 18:13.091
We're set, I've
got a boat for us

18:13.092 --> 18:14.962
we sail tonight.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.182
You crazy bastard, Kreditbank?

18:17.183 --> 18:19.793
Yeah, like Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.621
Wait, wait,
wait are you on something?

18:21.622 --> 18:23.449
Yeah, why, you want some?

18:23.450 --> 18:24.928
We are surrounded by
every cop in the capital.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.278
You should have told
me you were doing this.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.149
Yeah, I want to surprise you.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.933
What'd they offer you?
Huh, what do you mean?

18:29.934 --> 18:31.239
What do they
want you to kill me?

18:31.240 --> 18:32.632
I'd never do that.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.155
Yeah, I know
you'd never do that,

18:34.156 --> 18:35.461
but what'd the offer you?

18:35.462 --> 18:36.723
A little money? Nothing.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.116
Nothing, nothing No.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.291
C'mon. I'm a mediator.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.553
Oh, a mediator. Yeah.

18:40.554 --> 18:44.296
That sounds important.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.385
Hey, meet the girls, huh?

18:46.386 --> 18:49.779
Hey, girls, I want you
to meet my best friend,

18:49.780 --> 18:52.652
Gunnar Sorensson.

18:52.653 --> 18:56.046
Bum-ba-da-bum-bum-ba.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.440
Oh, sorry, this is Bianca.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.746
Bianca, Gunnar.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.269
And um?

19:01.270 --> 19:02.270
Klara. Klara.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.359
Gunnar, Klara. Hi.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.926
And...

19:05.927 --> 19:08.581
one government-issue pistol.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.235
Look at all this stuff.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.019
Why did you bring all this?

19:12.020 --> 19:13.629
Yeah, well,
in case we get delayed.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.550
You know, who knows what
we're gonna need, right?

19:17.417 --> 19:18.460
It's good, right?

19:23.858 --> 19:24.946
What?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.123
You didn't disable the cameras?

19:29.124 --> 19:31.343
No, I, I didn't think...

19:31.344 --> 19:32.605
You think I should of?

19:32.606 --> 19:34.433
I just thought,

19:34.434 --> 19:35.956
you know, we're
not gonna be here

19:35.957 --> 19:37.176
very long, you know?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.396
Where is the tape room?

19:42.093 --> 19:43.964
Down that hall.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.184
By the deposit vault.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.013
I'll check it out.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.668
Alright, well... it's,

19:52.669 --> 19:56.063
I just don't think it's that
big of deal, you know, I mean.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.673
Where are you going?

19:57.674 --> 19:59.327
No, yeah, right, right.
You stay with the girls.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.590
Yeah, yeah, I know,
of course, of course.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.291
I just...

20:28.662 --> 20:30.967
Somebody there?

20:47.942 --> 20:50.249
Hey. Look what I found.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.077
Who's he?

20:54.078 --> 20:55.254
He was hiding.

20:57.865 --> 20:58.995
Who are you, huh?

20:58.996 --> 21:00.040
I'm Elov.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.041
You know him?

21:01.042 --> 21:02.477
No. No.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.913
What do you do, huh?

21:03.914 --> 21:05.654
You a cop? No.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.961
I'm not.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.529
I've worked on a cruise ship.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.140
A cruise ship? What to America?

21:13.141 --> 21:14.446
Yes. Oh, right on.

21:14.447 --> 21:15.448
Sometimes, yes.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.841
What were you doing
in the supply room?

21:18.842 --> 21:20.974
I beg you, please,
just let me go.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.236
- Well he's not a cop.
- No.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.499
I'll tell you that.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.893
I say we let him go.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.025
Uhm.

21:29.592 --> 21:32.115
We could use another, um,

21:32.116 --> 21:34.074
another body, ya know?

21:34.075 --> 21:35.641
Kaj Hansson.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.512
Escaped from prison
seven months ago,

21:37.513 --> 21:39.514
and now he robs a bank
in order to spring

21:39.515 --> 21:41.603
his old bank robber
pal, Gunnar Sorensson.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.823
Chief, a man in the back hall

21:43.824 --> 21:45.390
is demanding to speak with you.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.914
Well, who is it?

21:48.481 --> 21:51.135
Mrs. Lind's husband is here.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.313
Come over, and let,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.967
let you talk to him.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.926
Don't let them boss you around.

21:59.927 --> 22:03.408
Yeah, whoa, whoa,
whoa! What do we get, huh?

22:03.409 --> 22:04.931
Yeah, we're hungry!

22:04.932 --> 22:06.454
Yeah, we could
starve to death in here

22:06.455 --> 22:07.716
waitin' for this Mustang!

22:07.717 --> 22:09.718
It's coming, and

22:09.719 --> 22:11.241
and we will bring you food.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.808
And beer.

22:12.809 --> 22:16.246
Yeah, food, beer,
cigarettes, Marlboro Reds.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.161
Yeah, yeah, slowly.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.946
Bianca, are you okay?

22:19.947 --> 22:21.862
Are you okay? I'm okay.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.646
What are you doing here?

22:24.647 --> 22:26.126
Why are you not with the kids?

22:26.127 --> 22:27.170
Well, I had to come.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.085
I, I mean. Go home.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.479
And make them dinner.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.612
And don't tell them about

22:33.613 --> 22:34.961
this.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.354
Okay, I won't.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.877
When will you be home?

22:37.878 --> 22:40.009
She'll be home
tonight if, ah, beanpole

22:40.010 --> 22:42.011
over here can keep
his promises, 'kay?

22:42.012 --> 22:43.100
Yeah, listen. Whoa.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.712
Let me take her spot.

22:46.713 --> 22:47.974
Ooh.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.628
Woohoohoohooooh.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.065
Sounding off like he's got
a pair, huh?

22:52.066 --> 22:54.372
I like that, I like that.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.895
But no.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.636
How about that, Gunnar?

22:57.637 --> 22:58.854
Why don't you come over
here and help us out?

22:58.855 --> 22:59.855
You heard him.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.293
He says no.

23:03.686 --> 23:04.686
I said no.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.340
Okay?

23:06.341 --> 23:08.037
In case you haven't
noticed, your wife's a fox.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.649
Hey. And you're not, huh? C'mon.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.085
No, wait, wait, please.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.913
It won't be long, okay.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.305
Write this down.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.437
Please, write it down.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.873
Okay, give me a pen, c'mon.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.354
I don't have one. Jakobsson.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.747
Okay, I got it.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.313
You take the herring
out of the fridge.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.880
I already deboned it,

23:24.881 --> 23:26.273
so you don't have
to worry about bones

23:26.274 --> 23:27.492
for Martin and
Mia when they eat.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.971
Why are you saying this?

23:28.972 --> 23:30.495
Because the fish, so
you can cook the fish.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.800
Okay, write this down.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.368
You take a, a
tablespoon of flour

23:34.369 --> 23:35.978
onto a plate,

23:35.979 --> 23:37.415
and add some salt and pepper,

23:37.416 --> 23:38.894
and then you put the fish in.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.330
In the plate?

23:40.331 --> 23:41.506
On the plate, and
then you turn it over.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.464
Okay. And you put

23:42.465 --> 23:43.899
a spoon on butter into the pan,

23:43.900 --> 23:45.466
and heat it up
until it gets brown.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.163
When the butter gets brown?

23:47.164 --> 23:48.338
The butter gets brown.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.384
And then you put the fish in,

23:50.385 --> 23:52.517
and you fry it for, um,

23:52.518 --> 23:54.257
four or five minutes. Not more.

23:54.258 --> 23:57.130
On each side because Mia
doesn't like when it's burned.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.784
I know. 'Cause she won't eat it.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.350
So, so that's important.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.135
Four or five minutes.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.093
And then, ah, the potatoes
I boiled last night.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.399
So you don't need to do
anything, you just take

24:05.400 --> 24:07.184
Bianca, Bianca,
I don't know, I, I.

24:08.708 --> 24:09.970
I love you.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.538
I love you, too.

24:13.539 --> 24:18.499
And the lingonberries jam is
in the jar your mom gave us.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.022
The green jar.

24:20.023 --> 24:23.069
It's in the side, in
the door of the fridge.

24:23.070 --> 24:26.115
Um, if I die, you can,
you can live on fish.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.421
You won't die.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.118
She won't die!

24:29.119 --> 24:30.163
She won't right?
Please don't tell them.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.686
Yes, she won't die

24:31.687 --> 24:33.383
as long as he gives me
what I need, alright?

24:33.384 --> 24:35.560
I need a Mustang! Please
don't tell them.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.431
Please don't tell Mia.
I need unmarked bills!

24:37.432 --> 24:38.824
I need food, I need cigarettes!

24:38.825 --> 24:40.347
You're not helpin'
me at all, Jack!

24:40.348 --> 24:43.437
It's all on its way, Kaj.

24:43.438 --> 24:48.051
Or, excuse me, would
you prefer Mr. Hansson?

24:49.705 --> 24:50.837
We know it's you.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.057
Call me whatever you want, okay?

24:55.058 --> 24:56.929
Hmm, good.

24:56.930 --> 24:59.540
And you cannot leave
with these hostages.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.281
Ah, yes,

25:01.282 --> 25:04.414
we will be taking the
hostages out of here.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.416
No, you can't.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.897
It's Prime Minister's orders.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.423
The car's a death
trap without them.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.208
The car is coming.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.950
You're free to go on your own.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.520
You might have to
kill one of them

25:22.521 --> 25:23.739
so we can get out of here.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.669
Some people,
quite properly appalled

25:41.670 --> 25:43.497
at the abuses that occurred,

25:43.498 --> 25:46.805
will say that
Watergate demonstrates

25:46.806 --> 25:49.808
the bankruptcy of the
American political system.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.419
Excuse me, Olof?

25:52.420 --> 25:54.247
Not now, please.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.683
I just received a call

25:55.684 --> 25:57.163
from Kaj Hansson at Kreditbank.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.471
He says he'll kill
the hostages, sir.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.605
This whole thing is absurd.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.172
Hello?

26:06.173 --> 26:08.174
Hello, Mr. Prime Minister.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.479
Mr. Hansson.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.569
Your Chief of Police

26:11.570 --> 26:12.961
says

26:12.962 --> 26:15.529
that you won't let us
leave with the hostages.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.487
That's quite right.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.881
So then you want
to be responsible

26:19.882 --> 26:22.536
for the deaths of
innocent citizens?

26:22.537 --> 26:24.016
No, of course not.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.322
Well, then,
let us leave with them.

26:26.323 --> 26:27.933
That is simply impossible.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.065
Olof,

26:31.415 --> 26:33.416
I am gonna count to 10,

26:33.417 --> 26:37.682
and if you don't agree to let
us leave with the hostages,

26:37.683 --> 26:39.640
then I'm going to kill.

26:39.641 --> 26:40.989
Klara, yeah.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.252
So, beginning now.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.689
Ten!

26:44.690 --> 26:45.820
Nine!

26:45.821 --> 26:48.301
Eight! No, no, no!

26:48.302 --> 26:49.737
Stop that!

26:49.738 --> 26:52.131
Do you agree? Seven!

26:52.132 --> 26:53.393
Stop it. Stop it!

26:53.394 --> 26:54.829
Sorry. Let go of me!

26:54.830 --> 26:56.178
Don't touch me again!

26:56.179 --> 26:57.571
Six! Five!

26:57.572 --> 26:59.181
- Four!
- Now you listen to me,

26:59.182 --> 27:00.269
Mr. Hansson.
Please stop you don't

27:00.270 --> 27:01.531
- wanna do this.
- Hey!

27:01.532 --> 27:03.055
Back off! Alright?

27:03.056 --> 27:04.796
Do you agree? Three!

27:04.797 --> 27:06.232
You stop that! Now!

27:06.233 --> 27:07.233
- Two, one, do you agree?
- No!

27:07.234 --> 27:08.277
Listen to me.

27:08.278 --> 27:10.105
Mr. Hansson!

27:10.106 --> 27:11.847
No!

27:15.068 --> 27:17.896
You have 'til tomorrow
to change you mind

27:17.897 --> 27:19.028
or one of them dies.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.422
Fuuuuuck!

27:22.423 --> 27:23.597
Fuck!

27:33.086 --> 27:34.652
You,

27:34.653 --> 27:35.784
you coward.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.091
Ah!

27:39.092 --> 27:40.832
You shut your mouth.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.672
I thought they'd cooperate.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.196
You know, I thought
they'd cooperate.

27:57.197 --> 27:59.372
I didn't think the
Prime Minister of Sweden

27:59.373 --> 28:01.069
doesn't give a shit
if they live or die.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.550
I mean, what's
that say about us?

28:05.901 --> 28:07.772
You know what they told me?

28:07.773 --> 28:11.819
That you kill a hostage, they
get you a plane out of here.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.387
How crazy is that, man?

28:18.044 --> 28:20.175
- No, no, no pills, no.
- No, I got to.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.524
- No, you need the sleep.
- Yeah, I can't, I can't

28:21.525 --> 28:23.091
I can't go to sleep.
This is wide open.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.832
I don't trust the cops.
We can't sleep.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.921
There's a vault
in the back there.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.793
We can sleep in there.

28:28.794 --> 28:29.794
I can't take this anymore.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.186
Don't worry.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.448
- I want go home.
- It's okay.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.189
It's gonna be okay.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.365
Bianca?

28:37.280 --> 28:39.282
You got a key to the vault?

28:58.301 --> 29:00.608
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

29:02.523 --> 29:05.177
Get in, in, in.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.744
Gunnar Sorensson is here

29:06.745 --> 29:09.181
to help us broker a
peaceful resolution.

29:09.182 --> 29:10.486
And the hostages?

29:10.487 --> 29:11.879
Can you confirm
their identities?

29:11.880 --> 29:13.838
Yes, Elov Erikkson,

29:13.839 --> 29:17.015
Bianca Lind and Klara Mardh.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.712
Has Mr.
Hansson harmed any of them?

29:18.713 --> 29:21.236
Actually,
we spoke half an hour ago

29:21.237 --> 29:23.151
with a gentleman
hiding out in Hawaii

29:23.152 --> 29:25.850
who claims to be the
real Kaj Hansson.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.982
And what did he say?

29:27.983 --> 29:29.375
He said he's gonna sue all of us

29:29.376 --> 29:30.942
for spreading libelous rumors.

29:30.943 --> 29:33.118
Said he would never
take hostages.

29:33.119 --> 29:36.512
So if the robber's not
Kaj Hansson, who is it?

29:36.513 --> 29:38.384
Well, we are working on that.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.038
And the girls,
have, have they been harmed?

29:40.039 --> 29:41.387
Yes,

29:41.388 --> 29:42.476
and we fear

29:43.564 --> 29:45.043
he may rape them.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.916
Bullshit! Turn
that off. Goddamn!

29:51.311 --> 29:53.007
Why would they say that?

29:53.008 --> 29:54.444
Cops lie to get what they want.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.447
Do I look like a rapist?

30:01.234 --> 30:02.451
Jeez, if I knew
we were going to be

30:02.452 --> 30:03.801
spending all night in here,

30:03.802 --> 30:05.106
I would have brought
your 12-string.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.804
This guy can play, okay?

30:06.805 --> 30:09.981
In Kalmar, Gunnar played
beautifully, all night long.

30:09.982 --> 30:12.853
Remember, ah, Helsingborg?

30:12.854 --> 30:14.637
At the fair.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.552
- We used to sing.
- Hmm.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.903
No, thank you.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.948
We used to knock this
Dylan song out of the park.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.776
Remember that?

30:22.777 --> 30:24.299
- Tomorrow is a long time.
- Ah, yeah.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.249
Nice one.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.340
Bring the canisters in here.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.067
I'm sorry.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.286
I'm sorry, I just, I
wanted to listen to music.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.507
I, I didn't know until I,

33:09.291 --> 33:12.119
I like music, I like when
you were singing before.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.731
I had one of them when I was 19.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.263
So, um, so you're
from Helsinborg?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.005
Born there.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.702
Grew up in the states.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.836
- Yeah, yeah, the accent, I.
- Mmhmm.

33:38.494 --> 33:40.322
I remember, I ah,

33:42.020 --> 33:43.717
I saw a photo in Helsinborg

33:45.501 --> 33:47.547
paper maybe, five,
six years ago.

33:49.723 --> 33:50.941
That was you, right?

33:53.901 --> 33:55.207
You broke into

33:56.338 --> 33:57.861
elderly couple's house.

33:59.472 --> 34:02.082
And the old man's heart
started acting up.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.433
His wife asked you to
get his heart medicine,

34:06.131 --> 34:08.002
and you did and
you saved his life.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.397
Wasn't me.

34:23.496 --> 34:26.063
When we get out of here,

34:26.063 --> 34:29.501
they're gonna put a transmitter
under the car, right?

34:29.502 --> 34:31.545
They're gonna track us.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.636
But if Gunnar and I could
slip out of the car,

34:34.637 --> 34:37.857
near the cove, and somebody
else drove it up the E4.

34:37.858 --> 34:39.164
Just for a couple hours.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.775
That'd give us enough time to

34:43.036 --> 34:44.647
sail across the Baltic.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.563
You think you could
do that for me?

34:49.565 --> 34:51.001
What, me? Yeah.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.571
You don't know how to drive?

34:56.572 --> 34:58.051
Yes, yes, I do.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.271
Then you could do it.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.622
No.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.798
Where are you going, what's...?

35:05.799 --> 35:07.756
I'm gonna go to France.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.063
And take the money.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.500
Gonna get a plastic surgeon.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.981
Start over, you know?

35:19.856 --> 35:22.423
I remember, um,

35:22.424 --> 35:25.253
the Helsinborg's
robber had a, a wife.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.388
And a kid.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.696
It was an ex-wife.

35:34.697 --> 35:35.698
And a son.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.139
What was the name of
the Helsinborg robber?

35:42.705 --> 35:46.534
That little priss's
name was Lars, okay?

35:46.535 --> 35:48.188
But that's not me.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.625
That's not who I am.

35:53.499 --> 35:55.892
I have a daughter. And a son.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.461
I'd like to see
them again, Lars.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.149
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.585
Were you sleeping?

36:37.586 --> 36:39.544
No, no, of course not.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.067
Where are you?

36:41.068 --> 36:42.460
Have you been freed?

36:42.461 --> 36:44.462
No, I'm, I'm still at the bank.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.115
Wha, what, what does that mean?

36:46.116 --> 36:47.334
I, I don't have much time.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.467
I just, um...

36:50.947 --> 36:53.122
I, I miss Mia and
Martin so much.

36:53.123 --> 36:56.430
I just wanna hear
their voices, I...

36:56.431 --> 36:59.303
I can't really think
about anything else.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.565
What about me?

37:00.566 --> 37:01.653
Tcha.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.177
I'm kidding.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.397
I just got Mia down.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.660
Can you, can you wake her up?

37:08.661 --> 37:10.314
She really needs
to sleep, Bianca.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.881
I know, but...

37:14.014 --> 37:15.320
You didn't tell her, did you?

37:17.191 --> 37:18.931
You did.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.106
It's all over the news.

37:20.107 --> 37:22.064
She would have found out.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.370
Christopher, I told
you, I, I asked you not to.

37:23.371 --> 37:24.893
I'm not as strong as you.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.982
I'm, can you please just worry

37:26.983 --> 37:28.636
about getting
yourself out of there.

37:28.637 --> 37:29.637
Of course, yes.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.422
I'll, I'll try harder tomorrow.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.642
I didn't
mean it like that, I'm...

37:36.689 --> 37:38.342
Is he listening?

37:38.343 --> 37:39.866
No.

37:40.954 --> 37:41.998
No, he's not listening.

37:43.826 --> 37:45.262
He's,

37:45.263 --> 37:46.567
he let me call.

37:46.568 --> 37:47.787
He didn't have to.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.093
He's not all bad.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.486
What are you saying?

37:52.487 --> 37:54.749
Uh, uh, I just mean,
nobody's all bad.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.100
No, but that man is an animal.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.060
Bianca?

38:01.061 --> 38:02.192
Yes?

38:03.585 --> 38:06.718
How, um, how did
the fish turn out?

38:06.719 --> 38:09.155
I took a
meatloaf out of the freezer.

38:09.156 --> 38:10.288
It was easier.

38:11.724 --> 38:12.812
Right.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.596
Well, I have to, um...

38:15.597 --> 38:16.597
Be careful.

38:16.598 --> 38:17.598
Yeah, good night.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.387
How was the fish?

38:23.910 --> 38:25.171
They had meatloaf.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.193
Bianca, Bianca.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.542
What's going on?

38:48.543 --> 38:49.543
Huh?

38:50.937 --> 38:52.154
What are you two,

38:52.155 --> 38:53.417
what are you two up to, huh?

38:53.418 --> 38:54.462
It's my period.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.508
What's going on?

38:57.509 --> 38:58.639
Uh.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.945
I need tampons.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.226
She, she got her period.

39:02.470 --> 39:03.644
She need tampons.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.254
What?

39:05.255 --> 39:07.648
Where are we supposed
to get tampons?

39:07.649 --> 39:10.651
Wha... don't you have any?

39:10.652 --> 39:12.044
It's way too early.

39:12.045 --> 39:13.785
It's not supposed to come yet.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.962
It's the trauma.
Her body is stressed.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.268
Huh.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.141
Okay, yeah, I see, okay.

39:22.577 --> 39:23.882
Ask the cops.
Yeah, I'll get the,

39:23.883 --> 39:25.231
I'll, I'll get the cops.

39:25.232 --> 39:26.451
Thank you.

39:28.627 --> 39:29.757
Hey!

39:29.758 --> 39:31.759
Emergency!

39:31.760 --> 39:33.935
Emergency! It's Klara!

39:33.936 --> 39:35.807
Shit! Easy, easy. Easy.

39:35.808 --> 39:37.199
What happened?

39:37.200 --> 39:39.506
It's Klara, she's bleeding man.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.465
You know, we know
you're not Kaj.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.510
Who are you?

39:43.511 --> 39:46.078
Don't worry about that
right now, okay, Kojak?

39:46.079 --> 39:47.732
Alright, we got bigger problems.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.168
Alright, she's, she's.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.778
What did you do to her?

39:50.779 --> 39:52.345
I didn't do anything,
man, it's her time.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.739
It's, it's, you know, c'mon.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.131
She, she, I need some,

39:56.132 --> 39:57.959
tampons, okay?

39:57.960 --> 40:00.962
Look, we need to check the
health of all of the hostages.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.312
You don't need anything, okay?

40:03.313 --> 40:06.359
Except to get Klara
some tampons, okay?

40:06.360 --> 40:09.188
And if you get them, I will
bring everybody out here,

40:09.189 --> 40:10.798
and you can give 'em a
clean bill of health.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.147
Alright?

40:12.148 --> 40:13.584
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

40:13.585 --> 40:14.672
Thank you.

40:19.808 --> 40:20.982
We were supposed to be covering

40:20.983 --> 40:22.419
the Crayfish Festival today,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.029
but as you can see,

40:24.030 --> 40:26.205
media has arrived
here and in the square

40:26.206 --> 40:27.641
from all over Europe.

40:27.642 --> 40:28.816
The police are desperate here

40:28.817 --> 40:30.470
in Central Stockholm.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.341
Authorities
have received over 200 calls

40:32.342 --> 40:34.474
from citizens
offering suggestions

40:34.475 --> 40:36.042
to end this crisis.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.749
Mrs. Lind,
ah, how are you feeling?

40:48.750 --> 40:50.534
Not so good.

40:50.535 --> 40:51.839
I like to go home.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.015
Don't worry, sweetheart.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.626
We're taking care of everything.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.236
Is that so?

40:57.237 --> 40:58.585
You think we should trust
you and your partner?

40:58.586 --> 41:00.457
My dear, dear girl.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.284
You are not thinking straight.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.722
Hey, don't patronize her.
Okay, we've had enough of that.

41:04.723 --> 41:05.940
All of us.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.202
Don't listen to him.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.335
You see, everybody's fine.

41:09.336 --> 41:11.772
Alright, we just
need the tampons.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.992
We need the bag that
hopefully has the vests in it,

41:13.993 --> 41:15.602
and you have to convince
the Prime Minister

41:15.603 --> 41:18.084
to let us leave today
or somebody dies.

41:19.085 --> 41:20.347
I'm trying.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.914
Okay, c'mon.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.872
Go get us some breakfast
now, it's taken so long.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.395
Alright?

41:26.396 --> 41:28.789
Our deal is expiring soon.

41:28.790 --> 41:30.183
You shut up about the deal.

41:35.536 --> 41:38.451
Do you see how cozy they are?

41:38.452 --> 41:39.975
The way they speak to us.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.196
Yeah.

41:48.375 --> 41:49.375
Pick it up.

41:50.725 --> 41:52.987
- Me?
- Yeah. Pick it up.

41:55.077 --> 41:56.513
Hello?

41:56.514 --> 41:58.732
I am Vincent Oberg with

41:58.733 --> 42:00.517
the Swedish Television
outside the Kreditbank.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.518
Who's this?

42:01.519 --> 42:02.997
Uh, this is Bianca Lind.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.912
Who is it? It's a journalist.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.610
Mrs. Lind, Vincent
Oberg, Swedish Television.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.307
Yeah, you just said that.

42:08.308 --> 42:10.309
All of Sweden
would like to know,

42:10.310 --> 42:12.591
what is it like being stuck
in there with those criminals?

42:13.443 --> 42:14.748
It's not too bad.

42:14.749 --> 42:16.011
We want to leave with them.

42:17.230 --> 42:18.360
With the robbers?

42:18.361 --> 42:20.275
That's correct.

42:20.276 --> 42:22.757
But why, I, I don't understand?

42:23.845 --> 42:25.454
'Cause we want to live.

42:25.455 --> 42:27.239
Sure, but, but you trust them?

42:27.240 --> 42:29.458
More than we trust our police.

42:29.459 --> 42:31.983
Ah, why haven't you left then?

42:31.984 --> 42:33.898
Because our own Prime Minister

42:33.899 --> 42:35.464
refuses to let us go.

42:35.465 --> 42:37.815
He doesn't seem to care.

42:37.816 --> 42:39.730
You think this is political?

42:39.731 --> 42:41.688
Could you connect me
to Vincent Oberg, thank you.

42:41.689 --> 42:43.211
Everything is political.

42:43.212 --> 42:44.212
But surely the Prime Minister

42:44.213 --> 42:45.474
cares about your life.

42:45.475 --> 42:46.954
The Prime Minister's
on line two.

42:46.955 --> 42:48.608
I'll patch him into
the switchboard.

42:48.609 --> 42:49.827
Hang up, that's it.

42:49.828 --> 42:51.393
That's all I have to say.

42:51.394 --> 42:53.570
Hold on, Miss Lind? Hold on.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.311
I have the Prime
Minister on the line.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.749
Sir, you're live with Miss Lind.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.098
You hear this?

43:00.099 --> 43:01.490
Hello? Hello?

43:01.491 --> 43:03.971
Mrs. Lind, I've been listening.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.494
It's not that simple.

43:05.495 --> 43:08.149
Mr. Prime Minister, it is.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.935
If you let us go, we might live.

43:11.284 --> 43:13.502
If the police don't interfere,

43:13.503 --> 43:15.984
nobody will get hurt
and we will survive.

43:17.551 --> 43:19.378
You can save our lives.

43:19.379 --> 43:21.206
And the best way to do that,

43:21.207 --> 43:22.773
is not to let 'em out
on the roads with you.

43:22.774 --> 43:24.862
But we are willing
to take that risk.

43:24.863 --> 43:27.038
I wish that
would make a difference,

43:27.039 --> 43:29.518
but as Prime Minister,
I'm responsible

43:29.519 --> 43:31.172
for all the Swedish people.

43:31.173 --> 43:33.087
Exactly.
But all the Swedish people

43:33.088 --> 43:35.829
are not in here, we are
trapped in here. We.

43:35.830 --> 43:37.483
And,

43:37.484 --> 43:38.876
and if the police comes in,

43:38.877 --> 43:41.008
and they start shooting,
he will shoot back,

43:41.009 --> 43:42.880
and then nobody will survive.

43:42.881 --> 43:44.751
We live in an orderly society.

43:44.752 --> 43:46.884
We should not be able
to violent methods

43:46.885 --> 43:48.146
to do such things.

43:48.147 --> 43:49.843
He's not violent.

43:49.844 --> 43:52.193
And this is not the time
to talk about this society.

43:52.194 --> 43:53.282
I am violent, hey?

43:54.980 --> 43:56.763
Did you hear what
I said last night?

43:56.764 --> 43:58.243
- Now you listen to me.
- Okay,

43:58.244 --> 44:00.811
If I'm not allowed to
leave here right now,

44:00.812 --> 44:03.552
one of these hostages
is going to die.

44:03.553 --> 44:05.337
Please, stop it.
Alright, and if it's Mrs. Lind,

44:05.338 --> 44:07.078
I hope you have the guts

44:07.079 --> 44:08.906
to walk over to her house,

44:08.907 --> 44:11.560
and look her small son
and her small daughter

44:11.561 --> 44:14.346
in the eyes and say that
you did the right thing.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.130
I got an idea, come here, mmhmm.

44:16.131 --> 44:17.523
- What?
- I've got an idea.

44:17.524 --> 44:18.611
Give me your pistol,
I need the pistol.

44:18.612 --> 44:20.091
Why?

44:20.092 --> 44:21.353
Give it me, here, hey,
let her go, alright?

44:21.354 --> 44:22.746
Go.

44:22.747 --> 44:24.051
Where are you taking her, man?

44:24.052 --> 44:25.227
Where are you going?

44:26.968 --> 44:28.491
Okay, okay.

44:31.146 --> 44:32.669
You wanna see your
kids again, right?

44:32.670 --> 44:33.670
Yes, of course.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.671
Right, okay.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.368
I got to kill someone, right?

44:36.369 --> 44:38.413
I mean, I've got to and I,
I think it should be you.

44:38.414 --> 44:40.198
What? You know, I,

44:40.199 --> 44:42.983
they will never let any
of us out of here alive

44:42.984 --> 44:45.725
if they don't believe
that I killed somebody.

44:45.726 --> 44:47.031
Okay?

44:47.032 --> 44:48.162
So,

44:48.163 --> 44:49.686
think?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.688
So you wanna,
you wanna shoot me?

44:51.689 --> 44:54.995
Yeah, I, I wanna
put this vest on you.

44:54.996 --> 44:56.649
Okay, you understand?

44:56.650 --> 44:59.957
I'm gonna go out there
by the stairs with you.

44:59.958 --> 45:02.350
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
pretend to negotiate.

45:02.351 --> 45:05.310
We'll have a given signal, okay?

45:05.311 --> 45:07.878
You try to run, I shoot,

45:07.879 --> 45:10.837
up close at an angle, alright?

45:10.838 --> 45:11.839
It'll hurt.

45:12.753 --> 45:13.928
It'll hurt a lot,

45:14.886 --> 45:16.191
but you won't die.

45:19.368 --> 45:20.979
Have you done this before?

45:24.243 --> 45:25.722
Gunnar has.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.550
He did it a few years ago.

45:30.510 --> 45:32.119
Now listen, if
you're too scared,

45:32.120 --> 45:34.034
I'm just gonna make Elov do it.

45:34.035 --> 45:36.210
I am not too scared.

45:36.211 --> 45:39.344
It's just, you are so much
more valuable than he is.

45:39.345 --> 45:42.651
You're a woman, you're a mother.

45:42.652 --> 45:45.045
You're extremely valuable.

45:45.046 --> 45:46.786
Alright, the only
part I don't like,

45:46.787 --> 45:49.049
is then we're gonna have to
leave without you, alright?

45:49.050 --> 45:51.965
I'll take Klara, I'll take Elov.

45:51.966 --> 45:53.575
We'll get in the car, we'll go.

45:53.576 --> 45:56.361
The cops will come
in, they'll find you,

45:56.362 --> 45:59.800
and they'll just take you
straight home to your children.

46:04.239 --> 46:05.239
So,

46:07.373 --> 46:09.809
you and the others will survive,

46:09.810 --> 46:11.290
and I can go home?

46:22.475 --> 46:24.564
Do you belong to
the Swedish Church?

46:26.305 --> 46:27.435
Yeah.

46:27.436 --> 46:28.437
I do.

46:30.222 --> 46:33.224
Dear God who holds
his children dear.

46:33.225 --> 46:35.095
Look to me, as little as I am.

46:35.096 --> 46:37.445
My fate is in your hands.

46:56.248 --> 46:57.466
Bianca. Yes?

46:58.641 --> 46:59.990
Bianca, that'll be our signal.

46:59.991 --> 47:01.166
I'll say your name.

47:02.036 --> 47:03.123
And then

47:03.124 --> 47:04.908
you'll run,

47:04.909 --> 47:06.084
and I'll fire.

47:07.172 --> 47:08.172
Okay?

47:11.263 --> 47:12.698
Hey!

47:12.699 --> 47:13.700
Pigs!

47:14.744 --> 47:15.833
C'mon out!

47:18.139 --> 47:19.139
Alright, alright.

47:19.140 --> 47:20.575
Listen to me.

47:20.576 --> 47:21.707
I'm done.

47:21.708 --> 47:23.274
Okay, I'm done.

47:23.275 --> 47:25.406
One of two things is
gonna happen right now.

47:25.407 --> 47:28.975
You're gonna get me my
car and my unmarked bills,

47:28.976 --> 47:30.629
and I'm gonna drive outta here,

47:30.630 --> 47:33.066
or I am gonna kill this woman.

47:33.067 --> 47:34.459
- You understand?
- Oh, relax,

47:34.460 --> 47:36.156
you're not going
to shoot anyone.

47:36.157 --> 47:37.592
Oh, really?

47:37.593 --> 47:39.464
We know who you are.

47:39.465 --> 47:40.813
Now.

47:40.814 --> 47:43.903
You are the Helsignborg robber,

47:43.904 --> 47:45.210
Lars Nystrom.

47:46.951 --> 47:48.516
Ah, you're a big softie.

47:48.517 --> 47:50.737
Maybe even a bit of a queer.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.957
I'm not queer, asshole!

47:53.958 --> 47:55.480
It makes sense with the,

47:55.481 --> 47:57.482
- the long hair.
- Shut up! Shut up!

47:57.483 --> 47:59.571
- Yeah, Bianca can feel it.
- Shut up, no!

47:59.572 --> 48:01.312
Bianca, look at
me. You don't talk to Bianca!

48:01.313 --> 48:02.270
I talk to Bianca! Bianca,
look over here.

48:02.271 --> 48:03.444
No! No!

48:03.445 --> 48:05.185
Ah!

48:07.493 --> 48:08.536
Oh.

48:08.537 --> 48:09.581
Shit!

48:11.714 --> 48:13.411
- What's going on?
- Shut up.

48:13.412 --> 48:14.499
Lars?

48:25.424 --> 48:27.642
Oh, Oooooh!

48:27.643 --> 48:29.383
Fuck! Oh!

48:29.384 --> 48:30.602
Shit.

48:47.968 --> 48:51.579
Vinter, how could I
be so bloody wrong?

48:51.580 --> 48:52.841
Gunnar!

48:52.842 --> 48:54.583
- Sit, sit.
- Gunnar!

48:56.846 --> 48:58.195
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

48:58.196 --> 48:59.500
Oh, shit.

48:59.501 --> 49:00.981
What happened? Oh, shit.

49:02.026 --> 49:03.027
Huh?

49:04.376 --> 49:05.854
What happened, man?

49:05.855 --> 49:07.508
She tried to escape, okay?

49:07.509 --> 49:09.032
She tried to escape and I...

49:09.033 --> 49:11.469
I shot her, I, I, I...

49:11.470 --> 49:12.600
You shot her?

49:12.601 --> 49:14.516
Accidentally, I, I...

49:15.343 --> 49:16.865
You're insane.

49:16.866 --> 49:18.345
You come in here,

49:18.346 --> 49:19.825
- and you, you killed.
- Shut up!

49:19.826 --> 49:21.783
- An unarmed woman!
- Get back, back!

49:21.784 --> 49:23.481
Sit down!

49:25.875 --> 49:27.442
Oh, fuck.

49:58.299 --> 50:00.257
Ten minutes ago,
we heard more gunfire

50:00.258 --> 50:02.346
inside the Kreditbank.

50:02.347 --> 50:04.130
Chief Mattsson has
confirmed that

50:04.131 --> 50:06.437
one of the hostages,
Miss Bianca Lind,

50:06.438 --> 50:08.569
has been killed by Lars Nystrom.

50:08.570 --> 50:11.616
Did her bizarre trust in
him lead to her death?

50:11.617 --> 50:15.533
And why are authorities
loading tear gas into the bank?

50:15.534 --> 50:17.970
They are growing desperate
to end this ordeal,

50:17.971 --> 50:20.973
but they must now await Prime
Minister Palme's approval

50:20.974 --> 50:24.063
to let Nystrom leave with
the remaining hostages.

50:24.064 --> 50:27.284
I'm Vincent Oberg, live
from Central Stockholm.

50:27.285 --> 50:28.503
They're buying for time.

50:30.418 --> 50:33.986
They're gonna drill a
hole through the ceiling,

50:33.987 --> 50:36.162
and then they're gonna
give us the tear gas.

50:36.163 --> 50:38.426
No, don't worry, there's
solid concrete up there.

50:40.037 --> 50:41.907
Did I ever tell you
about my buddy, Pete?

50:41.908 --> 50:43.126
Pete Noonan?

50:43.127 --> 50:44.344
Who?

50:44.345 --> 50:46.172
My Vietnam Navy buddy?

50:46.173 --> 50:49.784
Got exposed to that gas, 90
seconds, scrambled his brain.

50:49.785 --> 50:51.657
I mean, he's a
babbling idiot now.

51:03.756 --> 51:04.886
Yep.

51:09.501 --> 51:10.502
What is that?

51:18.075 --> 51:19.858
You hear that?

51:19.859 --> 51:21.164
Yeah, I hear it.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.600
What is it?

51:22.601 --> 51:24.384
I don't know.

51:24.385 --> 51:26.866
Get in here,
get in here. Both of you.

51:40.619 --> 51:42.402
What is it?

51:42.403 --> 51:43.491
You see anything?

51:47.321 --> 51:48.713
A microphone.

51:48.714 --> 51:50.584
A microphone?

51:50.585 --> 51:51.585
Let me see.

51:53.197 --> 51:54.676
What do you mean?

51:56.939 --> 51:58.245
Outside.

52:00.900 --> 52:03.336
Come here, come.

52:10.562 --> 52:13.085
Wait in here.

52:18.526 --> 52:20.484
You're alive.

52:20.485 --> 52:22.007
Oh, my God.

52:22.008 --> 52:23.965
I thought you were dead.

52:23.966 --> 52:25.793
Oh,

52:25.794 --> 52:26.794
my God.

52:26.795 --> 52:28.274
Oh, my God.

52:28.275 --> 52:30.363
Come here, come here.

52:30.364 --> 52:31.583
Let me see you.

52:32.932 --> 52:36.631
Oh, God, oh.

52:38.677 --> 52:40.808
It just went black
when I hit the floor.

52:40.809 --> 52:41.854
Shh.

52:44.422 --> 52:46.988
They slipped a microphone
in here, they're listening.

52:46.989 --> 52:49.339
We have to be quiet.

52:49.340 --> 52:51.689
They think we don't know.

52:51.690 --> 52:53.952
So now, we talk
for the microphone,

52:53.953 --> 52:56.259
try to get everyone out.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.347
When he gets here,

52:57.348 --> 52:59.175
we'll figure out what to say.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.828
We need to speak loudly.

53:02.004 --> 53:03.396
What the fuck?

53:03.397 --> 53:04.397
Shit.

53:05.660 --> 53:07.052
What's going on?

53:07.053 --> 53:09.010
Well, it's the
same thing you did, man.

53:09.011 --> 53:10.577
Same thing.

53:10.578 --> 53:12.057
Careful, careful, careful.

53:12.058 --> 53:13.363
Careful, careful, careful.
Sorry, sorry.

53:13.364 --> 53:14.364
Careful.

53:14.365 --> 53:15.365
Careful, careful, ya.

53:15.366 --> 53:16.757
I don't understand.

53:16.758 --> 53:18.281
I pulled the same
stunt that you did.

53:18.282 --> 53:20.152
At, at the Goteberg robbery?
What?

53:20.153 --> 53:21.762
When you shot Joelle,

53:21.763 --> 53:23.111
and he had the vest on
and you fooled everybody.

53:23.112 --> 53:24.722
What are you talking about?

53:24.723 --> 53:26.071
She's got a vest on.

53:26.072 --> 53:27.420
What, I, I taught you that?

53:27.421 --> 53:28.682
Yeah.

53:28.683 --> 53:29.901
You believed that story?

53:29.902 --> 53:31.424
That didn't happen?

53:31.425 --> 53:32.513
Of course not.

53:34.689 --> 53:37.256
I mean, nice play,
Lars, it's risky,

53:37.257 --> 53:39.737
but it's fucking crazy, man.

53:39.738 --> 53:43.306
I mean, how, how could you
not know she wasn't dead?

53:43.307 --> 53:46.396
Well, I, I was, I don't know.

53:46.397 --> 53:48.006
It's just a little bruise.

53:48.007 --> 53:49.703
I got scared, man.

53:49.704 --> 53:50.923
You got scared?

53:52.098 --> 53:54.099
Listen, here's the plan, okay?

53:54.100 --> 53:55.753
There's a microphone.

53:55.754 --> 53:57.755
We can go in there, we
can say whatever we want,

53:57.756 --> 54:00.801
but they have to believe
that Bianca is dead.

54:00.802 --> 54:01.802
Tch.

54:04.719 --> 54:06.242
I need ice and painkillers.

54:06.243 --> 54:08.114
Ice and pain killers?

54:10.159 --> 54:11.944
You jerk.

54:13.685 --> 54:15.338
Chief? Hmm?

54:15.339 --> 54:16.862
They're back in the vault.

54:20.082 --> 54:22.170
Ice and painkillers help

54:22.171 --> 54:23.607
at this time of the month.

54:23.608 --> 54:25.173
I'm, I'm really hungry.

54:25.174 --> 54:27.698
Quit your bitchin'
or I'll kill you too.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.834
Yeah, yeah, Mattsson here.

54:33.835 --> 54:36.054
Chief Mattsson, now
you've got one dead hostage,

54:36.055 --> 54:37.490
you want another?

54:37.491 --> 54:38.752
Are you gonna let us
drive out of here?

54:38.753 --> 54:40.667
I have the authority

54:40.668 --> 54:42.147
to let you leave here
first thing in the morning.No.

54:42.148 --> 54:43.888
Now put Gunnar on the line.

54:43.889 --> 54:45.411
I'm not gonna
put Gunnar on the line.

54:45.412 --> 54:47.761
You can talk to
me, I'm in charge.

54:47.762 --> 54:49.154
This is Gunnar.

54:49.155 --> 54:51.809
How are the others?

54:51.810 --> 54:53.550
The others?

54:53.551 --> 54:55.247
Klara's scared.

54:55.248 --> 54:56.640
She's got cramps.

54:56.641 --> 54:57.858
We can send down a doctor.

54:57.859 --> 54:59.077
We don't need a doctor.

54:59.078 --> 55:00.339
We need ice and painkillers.

55:00.340 --> 55:01.340
And food.

55:01.341 --> 55:02.428
And food.

55:02.429 --> 55:03.690
And cigarettes.

55:03.691 --> 55:04.735
I have cigarettes.

55:06.259 --> 55:07.391
Want one?

55:13.832 --> 55:16.921
You're not allowed
to smoke in the vault.

55:16.922 --> 55:18.967
Well, Klara,

55:20.012 --> 55:22.535
this is my vault now.

55:22.536 --> 55:23.536
And we smoke,

55:25.191 --> 55:26.584
if I say we smoke.

55:29.282 --> 55:31.022
'Cause I'm in charge.

55:39.205 --> 55:41.162
Now,

55:41.163 --> 55:43.861
the only food we
have is one pear.

55:43.862 --> 55:47.343
And no, you can't have
any, so don't even ask.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.127
You want some food?

55:49.128 --> 55:50.347
You ask the cops.

55:52.523 --> 55:54.785
Start beggin' the cops.

55:54.786 --> 55:57.222
No, and you don't get any.

55:57.223 --> 55:58.223
Yum,

55:58.224 --> 55:59.224
yum,

55:59.225 --> 56:00.443
yum.

56:04.578 --> 56:06.405
Boy, this pear is delicious.

56:06.406 --> 56:08.408
- Huh, Gunnar?
- Something's wrong.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.370
Thank you.

56:16.808 --> 56:19.941
Ah, it's better that
he underestimates me.

56:25.773 --> 56:27.339
I don't know.

56:27.340 --> 56:28.601
That's how it starts.

56:28.602 --> 56:30.081
Yeah.

56:30.082 --> 56:33.214
Steve McQueen works
at this machine shop.

56:33.215 --> 56:35.435
When he gets out of
jail, he robs a bank.

56:37.350 --> 56:39.133
That's such a good movie.

56:39.134 --> 56:41.048
I saw it three times.

56:41.049 --> 56:43.050
Have you seen it?

56:43.051 --> 56:45.270
You look like Ali MacGraw.

56:45.271 --> 56:47.446
They, they let you
watch movies in prison?

56:47.447 --> 56:49.187
Oh, yeah.

56:49.188 --> 56:51.319
Yeah, they let you
see prostitutes in prison.

56:51.320 --> 56:53.844
Yeah, well, if you
get the conjugal room.

56:53.845 --> 56:55.193
They give you a couch.

56:55.194 --> 56:56.977
What do you have to pay them?

56:56.978 --> 56:58.980
That's pretty much
how prostitution works.

57:00.678 --> 57:03.420
Well, I know that.

57:06.379 --> 57:07.772
I was just saying, you know?

57:25.920 --> 57:28.748
- Fuck, why wouldn't you call man?
- I bring you supplies.

57:28.749 --> 57:29.836
What is your problem?

57:29.837 --> 57:31.142
What if I freaked out?

57:31.143 --> 57:33.710
- Just relax, Lars.
- Huh?

57:33.711 --> 57:36.103
You know how I
found out who you are?

57:36.104 --> 57:37.888
I don't give a shit, man.

57:37.889 --> 57:39.542
Bianca told us.

57:39.543 --> 57:40.891
Before you killed her.

57:40.892 --> 57:43.459
She was just
pretending to like you.

57:43.460 --> 57:44.635
Trying to survive.

57:45.897 --> 57:47.375
You know that, right?

57:47.376 --> 57:48.855
Screw you, man.

57:48.856 --> 57:49.987
Screw

57:49.988 --> 57:51.379
you.

57:51.380 --> 57:53.686
Oh, little touchy
about her, are we?

57:56.821 --> 57:58.126
Sorensson, we need to chat.

57:59.867 --> 58:01.085
Why?

58:01.086 --> 58:03.523
A mediator talks to both sides.

58:05.830 --> 58:07.527
I was hoping he'd
sell you out by now.

58:08.789 --> 58:10.574
He's been lying to you Lars.

58:25.414 --> 58:27.459
You trying to
mess with his head?

58:27.460 --> 58:29.548
Well, someone has to.

58:29.549 --> 58:31.463
What happened to
our arrangement?

58:31.464 --> 58:33.900
Look, I, I didn't
know it was Lars, then.

58:33.901 --> 58:37.643
Oh, don't tell me
he's your best friend.

58:37.644 --> 58:39.863
You're the only
one you care about.

58:39.864 --> 58:41.517
End this before dark,

58:41.518 --> 58:43.693
or you will have the
same sentence as Lars.

58:49.787 --> 58:51.962
Now, what's up,
hey, what's going on?

58:51.963 --> 58:53.094
- We cool?
- Yeah.

58:54.443 --> 58:55.574
Yeah.

58:55.575 --> 58:56.923
Are you two alright?

58:56.924 --> 58:58.708
No, we're still
starving and tired.

58:58.709 --> 59:00.101
You just let us leave with him.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.453
They need to wear those vests.

59:05.977 --> 59:07.239
You have all of them?

59:08.588 --> 59:10.589
I see.

59:10.590 --> 59:12.417
Hey, look,
you wanna be concerned,

59:12.418 --> 59:13.984
get us keys to the Mustang.

59:13.985 --> 59:15.333
Oh, yeah.

59:15.334 --> 59:17.857
No, no no, whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:17.858 --> 59:19.467
C'mon, man.

59:19.468 --> 59:21.774
We don't need you in here,
back up and toss 'em.

59:21.775 --> 59:22.776
Huh, just toss them.

59:26.780 --> 59:28.128
Hey!

59:29.391 --> 59:30.696
Open the door! Jesus.

59:30.697 --> 59:32.306
Did you know he
was gonna do that?

59:32.307 --> 59:33.656
No! Did you know
he was gonna do that?

59:33.657 --> 59:35.005
You know, you are crazy, man.

59:35.006 --> 59:36.310
Were you in on this?

59:36.311 --> 59:37.877
No, you heard what I said.

59:37.878 --> 59:39.226
Fuck!

59:39.227 --> 59:40.358
Everyone to the vault.

59:40.359 --> 59:41.794
You alright, you okay?

59:41.795 --> 59:44.014
I need, I need the painkillers.

59:44.015 --> 59:45.712
Klara needs her painkillers.

59:48.367 --> 59:49.933
There's, there's no painkillers.

59:49.934 --> 59:51.761
There's no food, it's just ice.

59:55.766 --> 59:57.375
Go to the vault.

59:57.376 --> 59:58.464
Move, move, move, move.

59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.293
Cover the vault!

01:00:04.165 --> 01:00:05.165
Hold your positions.

01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:07.211
Await my orders.

01:00:08.866 --> 01:00:10.431
They're in position.

01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:12.609
Do not lower your weapons!

01:00:14.741 --> 01:00:17.221
The crisis here
has grown stranger still.

01:00:17.222 --> 01:00:19.223
Almost like an American movie.

01:00:19.224 --> 01:00:20.920
The police are threatening force

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:22.966
and the International
Media are baffled

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:25.403
by the irrational
behavior of the hostages.

01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:28.362
Psychiatrists are now
advising the police

01:00:28.363 --> 01:00:30.321
that the hostages
may be brainwashed.

01:00:30.322 --> 01:00:33.019
Everybody open your mouths.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.065
Hands over your ears.

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:37.328
Here we go.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.905
Jesus, what was that?

01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:50.341
Are the others gone?

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:51.734
We've lost the audio, yeah?

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.736
Is that it? Yeah.

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:55.346
Okay, he
blew up the fucking mic.

01:00:55.347 --> 01:00:57.000
Let's get a camera down there.

01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:58.479
Okay, we'll use the same
setup. No, no, no,

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.220
not until we
penetrate the ceiling.

01:01:00.221 --> 01:01:01.744
- We can use the same...
- Increase the drilling

01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:03.528
for the next three
hours, nonstop!

01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:04.921
Okay, Ingemar... And then turn up the heat.

01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:06.749
Yes, but... To suffocate them.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.272
Listen to what I'm saying.

01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:09.882
And then we freeze them. Ingemar?

01:01:09.883 --> 01:01:11.579
And then back again,

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.929
on, off, on, off, on, off,
on, Hang on, Ingemar, they're

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.060
going to get sick, okay? Of, on and off.

01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:15.758
What's gotten into you? No.

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:17.498
It's the hostages
I'm thinking of. Yeah, the hostages.

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:19.196
They have not eaten or drank... If
the hostages want our help

01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:20.937
they need to show
us some respect.

01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:22.373
All I am say...

01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:24.244
Oh, they... you look
what they're doing.

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:25.811
Those criminals that
think they're in charge.

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.117
But we are in charge.

01:01:27.118 --> 01:01:28.771
So let's turn up the heat,

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.773
and when they call
us, they will,

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.600
you do not answer the
phones, you hear me?

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:33.950
Do you hear me?

01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:35.256
I do Chief. Then get to it.

01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:38.998
Okay, you heard him, okay?

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:40.348
The heat goes up, yeah, go.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:16.993
This was a bad idea.

01:02:16.994 --> 01:02:17.995
What was?

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:20.083
All of it.

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:21.084
Everything.

01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:22.215
How can you say that?

01:02:22.216 --> 01:02:23.695
How could you say that?

01:02:23.696 --> 01:02:26.872
They're about to gas
us to death, alright?

01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:28.309
And you're taking their side?

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.050
If I was on their side.

01:02:35.142 --> 01:02:36.316
If I was on their side,

01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:38.579
you would be dead by now.

01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:43.976
Shit.

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:45.761
I'm not gonna let
you gas us to death!

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:46.979
No, Lars!

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.241
No, no!

01:02:51.202 --> 01:02:52.203
Cover the bloody hole!

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.379
Get the medic!

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.510
A medic!

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:57.947
No gas!

01:02:57.948 --> 01:02:58.948
No gas!

01:02:58.949 --> 01:03:00.645
No! Lars. No!

01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:02.299
Use your head.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.083
You kill a cop, we're all dead.

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:05.128
You killed a cop.

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:06.129
I did not.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.217
Yes, you did.

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:08.696
That was my idiot partner.

01:03:08.697 --> 01:03:10.002
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not so stupid!

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:12.048
You were there,
you got accessory!

01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:13.745
I did not pull the trigger.

01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:15.400
Not dead, anyway.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:17.357
Oh, yeah?

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:21.231
Is that it? Huh?

01:03:21.232 --> 01:03:22.536
Put it down. You put it down.

01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:24.321
Put it down.

01:03:24.322 --> 01:03:25.888
- You put it down.
- Please, stop this.

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:26.977
Please, listen to me.

01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:29.456
Please.

01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:30.632
Please, stop.

01:03:35.202 --> 01:03:37.725
C'mon, Gunnar.

01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:41.729
Oh, that's the way it is, huh?

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:43.688
So either I bust you out,

01:03:43.689 --> 01:03:45.690
or you turn me in,

01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:47.257
or you kill me, huh?

01:03:47.258 --> 01:03:50.216
It's a win win for
you, is that it, huh?

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:53.002
I've been giving you second
chances all your life, Lars.

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:57.920
I know, that is what brothers
do for each other, man!

01:03:57.921 --> 01:04:00.271
That is what having
each other's back means!

01:04:02.229 --> 01:04:05.014
Look, you don't wanna leave
me with me, I don't wanna go.

01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:06.015
Turn me in.

01:04:06.016 --> 01:04:07.494
Turn me in, I don't care.

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:08.495
What are they offering you, huh?

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:09.757
A lot.

01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:10.846
Yeah, how much am I worth, huh?

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.760
I just said, a lot.

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:14.545
Huh, c'mon, put
the gun down. Let's fight. What?

01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:15.894
C'mon, man, let's fight!

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:16.982
C'mon, like old times, c'mon!

01:04:16.983 --> 01:04:18.941
Put the gun down
and let's fight,

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.377
and then you can turn me in,

01:04:20.378 --> 01:04:21.813
and I won't even tell everybody

01:04:21.814 --> 01:04:22.858
how you've turned into
a little bitch cop

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.946
who stabbed me in the back.

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:25.078
Oh, my God.

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.645
He's like a child!

01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:29.081
Oh!

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:56.717
Stop!

01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:58.198
Stop!

01:04:59.547 --> 01:05:00.853
It's enough, stop!

01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:03.594
Off me!

01:05:07.164 --> 01:05:09.557
It's enough. It's enough.

01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:21.786
It's okay.

01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.179
Do it.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.572
Pull the trigger.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.444
I don't wanna see you killed.

01:05:27.445 --> 01:05:28.445
Please?

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:30.796
Just do it.

01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:51.859
Look who's got both guns now.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.557
Oh. Gee...

01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:55.776
Let's just all relax now.

01:05:55.777 --> 01:05:56.909
Yeah?

01:05:58.519 --> 01:05:59.868
Alright.

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:02.479
We good?

01:06:04.482 --> 01:06:06.397
Oh, we're great, Lars, yeah.

01:06:15.797 --> 01:06:17.974
Alright, let's get some rest.

01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:21.064
Gotta be alert on those roads.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.502
I'm very sorry, Frederick.

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.135
Let me see.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.318
It's gonna be okay.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.365
You were...

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:04.672
you were unbelievably
brave, you know?

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:07.892
Really.

01:07:09.677 --> 01:07:11.157
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:07:12.419 --> 01:07:13.985
It's incredible.

01:07:13.986 --> 01:07:16.031
Yeah, I was very brave.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.033
Lars?

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.210
Can I call home?

01:07:25.389 --> 01:07:28.392
You can't, no.
I mean, you can't.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.438
My...

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:35.051
my daughter

01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:37.575
probably thinks I'm dead and,

01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:40.186
and my parents, I.

01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:44.407
I can't even imagine what
they're going through.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:46.365
They just have to right now.

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:47.845
For a little bit longer.

01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:50.108
It's the only way we're
gonna get out of here.

01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:52.458
It's the only thing
that makes it worth it.

01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:53.678
Yeah.

01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:57.463
Okay.

01:07:57.464 --> 01:08:01.641
My father wishes I died a
long time ago, you know, so.

01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:04.296
No. Yeah, no,
you're better off...

01:08:04.297 --> 01:08:05.950
Yeah.

01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:07.778
I mean, look, I mean, I don't
want it to sound like that.

01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:10.694
Like I, I hate it when,
you know, professionals

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:13.175
act like it's all their
parents fault, you know?

01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:16.526
I mean, I, I deserved every
sentence I've ever gotten.

01:08:16.527 --> 01:08:18.397
And then some.

01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:20.529
You were not afraid of prison?

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:22.444
No, it's just

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:24.447
once you start making
money the easy way,

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:26.189
you can't go back.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:29.365
And then I stabbed somebody.

01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:30.930
What?

01:08:30.932 --> 01:08:33.194
I did, I, um,
there was this kiddiefiddler.

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:34.413
Like a real creep, like.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.502
Gunnar and I knew it for a fact.

01:08:37.504 --> 01:08:39.939
He lived down the hall from
us and we, we found out,

01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:41.987
and I took a butter
knife and I stabbed him.

01:08:47.906 --> 01:08:49.037
And Gunnar was

01:08:50.778 --> 01:08:52.127
with you, you, you were

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.345
living with Gunnar? Yeah, uhhuh, uhhuh.

01:08:54.346 --> 01:08:57.263
And then we were cellmates.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:03.312
You really love him, don't you?

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:06.316
He's like my brother. Hmm.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.492
You know, he was,

01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:11.408
he was really a,

01:09:13.975 --> 01:09:16.020
you know, he was really
strong, you know?

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.544
He taught me everything.

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:19.285
Ya know?

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:23.898
I don't know, Lars.

01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:57.687
We're going to send in tear gas.

01:10:57.688 --> 01:10:59.776
You have one minute to give up.

01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:01.691
Place your weapons into the bag,

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.997
slide it under the hole
so we can see them.

01:11:03.998 --> 01:11:06.826
One minute or we start the gas.

01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:08.524
No, no, no, no, no!

01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:09.525
What do you mean, you
said you were gonna...

01:11:09.526 --> 01:11:10.613
One minute!

01:11:10.614 --> 01:11:11.918
It's not the phone.

01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:13.442
You have to press
the red button.

01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:14.834
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey?

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:15.835
Hey, you said you
were gonna let us go?

01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:17.315
Things have changed.

01:11:17.316 --> 01:11:18.664
- What do you mean? What?
- Lars?

01:11:18.665 --> 01:11:20.144
We should do what he says. Fuck no!

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.406
No way, man!

01:11:21.407 --> 01:11:22.799
You, you, you said we could go!

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.453
One minute!

01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:26.498
How can they do that,
they can't gas us all!

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:27.934
I know they wanna
kill me, but for what?

01:11:27.935 --> 01:11:29.414
- Toss the guns in the bag.
- No way!

01:11:29.415 --> 01:11:31.547
- The guns in the bag!
- Fuck you! No!

01:11:31.548 --> 01:11:32.809
No retreat, man!

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:34.941
Why would they wanna
kill all of us?

01:11:34.942 --> 01:11:37.117
What you doing with
that? Put that down. Hey, don't touch her!

01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.510
Do not fucking touch her!
Calm down! Calm down!

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:40.512
I will blow your head off!

01:11:40.513 --> 01:11:41.513
Are you okay?

01:11:45.692 --> 01:11:47.346
I have an idea.

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:53.830
We're sending in the gas Lars.

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:55.222
Yeah, no, that's great,

01:11:55.223 --> 01:11:57.486
you just a, you pump the gas in,

01:11:57.487 --> 01:12:01.272
and then, ah, Elov and
Klara will die, no problem.

01:12:01.273 --> 01:12:03.318
They will be just fine.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.754
No, no, no,
they, they won't be fine.

01:12:04.755 --> 01:12:05.798
They have nooses
around their necks,

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:06.799
so when you put the gas in,

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.235
they'll pass out,

01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:09.194
and then they'll be
strangled to death,

01:12:09.195 --> 01:12:10.674
and it'll be your fault.

01:12:12.066 --> 01:12:14.459
What nooses? I
don't believe you.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.594
The nooses I
put around their necks.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.033
Uh... let me see.

01:12:23.034 --> 01:12:24.383
Hold on a minute.

01:12:25.863 --> 01:12:28.038
Set up the CCTV camera,
bring it over here.

01:12:28.039 --> 01:12:30.079
We're gonna place it inside
the hole to take a look.

01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:34.174
We're sending down a
camera through the hole.

01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:36.438
Now stay away,

01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:39.354
and don't do any
bloody shooting.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.486
Oh, shit, get down,
get down, get down.

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:42.966
On the ground like you're
dead, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.098
Get down.

01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:53.238
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:56.197
Now you let them free.

01:12:57.808 --> 01:13:00.418
All you have to do
is give me what I want,

01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:02.681
and let me leave
with my hostages

01:13:02.682 --> 01:13:04.640
and all this will be over.

01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:06.859
Let them out of those nooses!

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.166
Understood?

01:13:16.435 --> 01:13:17.436
Chief?

01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:19.568
You go down there.

01:13:19.569 --> 01:13:20.699
What you mean me?

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.005
I can go. No!

01:13:22.006 --> 01:13:24.094
I need you here.

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:27.227
You go down and
you let them out.

01:13:27.228 --> 01:13:30.144
Just go on, I, I've
lost all, bloody...

01:13:32.103 --> 01:13:33.191
Go on.

01:13:34.322 --> 01:13:35.584
Okay, we're gonna open the door

01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:37.803
and let them go, hang tight.

01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:40.154
Fuck! I mean, I'm sorry,
I'm coming down.

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:44.288
Do it, do it, do
it, do it, open the door!

01:13:44.289 --> 01:13:45.377
Open the door!

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.338
Jesus Christ, I
really fucked it up.

01:13:57.302 --> 01:13:58.542
I'm going to open the door now.

01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:05.048
- Alright, back up, back up, back up!
- Okay, easy.

01:14:05.049 --> 01:14:06.310
Back up.Easy.

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.138
Why are you here?
Where's Mattsson?

01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:09.487
He sent me.

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:10.489
Your car's ready.

01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:16.015
And he says that your
deal is over, Sorensson.

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:17.713
You're in this all the way now.

01:14:17.714 --> 01:14:18.845
Huh.

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:29.725
Keep your eye on the front door.

01:14:29.726 --> 01:14:31.291
See if you can take him.

01:14:31.292 --> 01:14:33.119
Stand back everybody.

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:36.819
Everybody behind the line.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.298
I can't wait to take a shower.

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:39.431
I'm quitting this job.

01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:51.398
So what's
gonna happen to us, man?

01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:53.009
Let's just get to France,

01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:54.576
and then we'll see what happens.

01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:56.621
Most likely you go your
way, I go mine, right?

01:14:56.622 --> 01:14:58.319
I think so, yes.

01:15:04.412 --> 01:15:06.283
You gonna give me the gun?

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:08.329
Why, you gonna help me?

01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:10.723
It's up to you.

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:47.020
Klara, come with me.

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:50.153
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:15.178
Why did he leave
that radio behind?

01:16:15.179 --> 01:16:17.180
What do you mean?
Well, it's for her.

01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:20.487
Yeah, he's a tender
brute, that Lars.

01:16:20.488 --> 01:16:22.142
Ibsen?

01:16:23.622 --> 01:16:25.536
Send in some gas.

01:16:25.537 --> 01:16:27.973
Just enough to bring
someone back from the dead.

01:16:27.974 --> 01:16:29.627
Yes, Chief.

01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:33.065
There's no harm if
she really is dead.

01:16:33.066 --> 01:16:34.153
Is it?

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:21.027
The money is in the trunk.

01:17:23.203 --> 01:17:25.248
Just keep your eyes on her.

01:17:27.164 --> 01:17:28.555
Get in the
middle, get in, get in

01:17:28.556 --> 01:17:31.471
get in, get in, get in.
Go in back.

01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:33.299
Back off, easy, easy.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.300
Listen to me.

01:17:34.301 --> 01:17:35.867
Listen to me.

01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:37.216
We've cleared the traffic
along the Hamngaten.

01:17:37.217 --> 01:17:38.784
You can take that
to the highway.

01:17:40.003 --> 01:17:41.134
Clear the way!

01:17:43.615 --> 01:17:45.485
There's nothing, Chief.

01:17:45.486 --> 01:17:47.227
No, yeah, it was worth a try.

01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:50.361
Just turn it off.

01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:54.452
Wait, do you see that?

01:17:56.889 --> 01:17:58.411
It's the Chief.

01:17:58.412 --> 01:18:00.065
Listen very carefully.

01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:02.415
Oh, listen to that purr!

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:05.202
Hahahaha, yes, yes!

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:08.813
Oh, yeah! Alright, here we go!

01:18:09.902 --> 01:18:12.164
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:13.905
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!
- Hold your fire!

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:16.734
Hold your fire, who did that?

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:18.431
- I'm gonna kill her!
- I'm gonna blow his

01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:19.694
- brains out right now!
- It was a mistake!

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:20.826
It was a mistake, I'm sorry!

01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:24.960
- Hold your fire!
- Was that gunfire?

01:18:24.961 --> 01:18:26.831
Hey, you want me to kill him?

01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:30.008
I will blow his brains
all over this car!

01:18:30.009 --> 01:18:32.707
Right on National TV!
We'll replace the tires.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:34.665
- Calm down.
- You lied to me, man.

01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:36.014
- Come out and I'll, I'll.
- No!

01:18:36.015 --> 01:18:37.842
- Escort you to the lobby.
- No!

01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:39.670
While they find a new tire.
I'm not leaving this car.

01:18:39.671 --> 01:18:41.367
Lars, I'm not
going back in there. I'm not...

01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:43.239
Look into the eyes of those men.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.762
Those volunteers,
they're terrified.

01:18:44.763 --> 01:18:46.068
You're not safe out here.

01:18:46.069 --> 01:18:48.026
I don't trust them anymore.

01:18:48.027 --> 01:18:49.202
I will kill her.

01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:51.900
Let's go.

01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:53.902
Back off! Back off! Back off!

01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:55.294
Stand down,
stand down! Everybody back off,

01:18:55.295 --> 01:18:56.774
or I'll blow her brains out.
Hold your fire!

01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:57.949
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Hold your fire!

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:58.950
Back up!

01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:01.954
I hate you! I hate you!

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.043
Hold your fire!

01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:07.089
I don't know what happened.

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:09.178
You'll be safer in here.

01:19:09.179 --> 01:19:11.746
This is so bad,
man, this is so bad.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.878
Ah, yes, it's terrible, I
don't understand what happened.

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.575
I'm very sorry.

01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:17.969
You tell them to
stop pointing their guns.

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:20.493
You tell them to stop
pointing their guns, man!

01:19:20.494 --> 01:19:22.321
And now we'll just wait in here

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:24.150
until they replace that tire.

01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:27.500
And in the meantime,
we should ah,

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:30.112
get Mrs. Lind's body
out of there, huh?

01:19:30.113 --> 01:19:33.419
Have you, no, do you have the,

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.117
you have the key to the vault?

01:19:35.118 --> 01:19:36.162
Please?

01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:39.557
Let's go back to the vault.

01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:43.038
I'm not going back to the vault.

01:19:43.039 --> 01:19:45.431
- C'mon, man, we got to.
- Please?

01:19:45.432 --> 01:19:47.695
No, you never go back.
Never go back!

01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:52.352
You don't want to leave her
in there. It's not right.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.441
We're going back to the vault.

01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:57.096
- Shit!
- C'mon.

01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.795
Put your guns down.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:01.971
Shame on you.

01:20:04.887 --> 01:20:07.062
Alright, alright,
go, go, go, go, go.

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:08.759
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:20:13.112 --> 01:20:14.765
Oh, shit!

01:20:14.766 --> 01:20:16.158
I got 'em, I got 'em.

01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:17.333
Here, take this,
take this, take this.

01:20:17.334 --> 01:20:18.769
- No closer.
- Ah, shit.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:20.553
Got it, got it, got
it, got it, got it!

01:20:20.554 --> 01:20:22.033
Give me that,
give me that, give me that,

01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:23.382
get in! In, in, in.

01:20:23.383 --> 01:20:24.819
Get back!

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.516
Stay back!

01:20:26.517 --> 01:20:28.213
Oh, you're not going in as well?

01:20:28.214 --> 01:20:30.737
Stay back.

01:20:30.738 --> 01:20:32.130
I have a confession to make,
Get out. Get out, they know!

01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:34.002
Lars? Lars! Wait.

01:20:34.003 --> 01:20:35.351
I know Mrs. Lind
is not inside the vault.

01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:36.526
Hey!

01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:37.657
Turn on the gas!

01:20:37.658 --> 01:20:38.738
Turn on the gas!

01:20:40.748 --> 01:20:42.706
Oh, God. Guys!

01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:44.360
No gas! Help!

01:20:44.361 --> 01:20:46.231
No gas! Oh shit, man,
it's gonna go to our brains.

01:20:46.232 --> 01:20:48.494
Oh fuck, no! No!

01:20:48.495 --> 01:20:50.628
- No, turn off the gas!
- I can't breathe.

01:20:52.325 --> 01:20:53.891
I don't want to die!

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:56.067
Please? Please?

01:20:57.461 --> 01:20:59.201
I'm not going back to prison!

01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:00.811
You said we had a deal, I'm
not going back to prison.

01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:03.553
I'm not going back.

01:21:03.554 --> 01:21:04.902
I'll shoot her.

01:21:04.903 --> 01:21:06.208
You hear me?

01:21:06.209 --> 01:21:08.340
No!

01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:09.559
You understand?

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.343
Turn off the gas!

01:21:11.344 --> 01:21:13.563
I will kill her.
Turn it off or I'll shoot her.

01:21:13.564 --> 01:21:16.174
Turn off the gas! Chief!
We need to turn off the gas.

01:21:17.524 --> 01:21:18.698
Your dead, Mattsson.

01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:19.787
Turn off the gas!

01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:22.137
Turn off the gas!

01:21:22.138 --> 01:21:23.616
I'll kill her, and make sure

01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:25.177
- we do it properly this time.
- Nooooo!

01:21:27.056 --> 01:21:29.492
Goddamnit, no gas!

01:21:29.493 --> 01:21:30.755
No gas, we give up!

01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:33.278
Please, help!

01:21:33.279 --> 01:21:35.498
No more gas!

01:21:35.499 --> 01:21:38.718
No more gas! Place the guns where
we can see them.

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:40.633
- Throw them in front of you.
- No more gas!

01:21:40.634 --> 01:21:42.419
Gas masks everyone!

01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:46.291
Get the hostages out first.

01:21:46.292 --> 01:21:48.641
Lars and Gunnar are left
alone with us in there?

01:21:48.642 --> 01:21:50.470
It was self defense, your honor.

01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:03.178
Step back from the door!

01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:07.878
Hostages first!

01:22:07.879 --> 01:22:08.879
C'mon!

01:22:11.491 --> 01:22:12.665
I said up!

01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:14.667
Stand up!

01:22:14.668 --> 01:22:15.755
You ladies first.

01:22:15.756 --> 01:22:16.974
C'mon.

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:18.455
Let's go together.

01:22:19.586 --> 01:22:21.196
They're gonna shoot Lars.

01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:24.461
C'mon, c'mon.

01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:27.637
We're coming out.

01:22:27.638 --> 01:22:29.204
Stay behind me.

01:22:29.205 --> 01:22:32.033
You have an angle on him?

01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:33.773
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:35.559
Don't be afraid, sweetheart.

01:22:36.429 --> 01:22:37.429
You're safe now.

01:22:39.693 --> 01:22:42.000
You separate them before
they get to the lobby.

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:53.185
You wanna go back to prison?

01:22:55.927 --> 01:22:57.146
Everyone got out alive.

01:22:58.669 --> 01:23:00.322
Now you owe me my freedom.

01:23:40.972 --> 01:23:42.495
Go, go, get, get, get.

01:23:43.888 --> 01:23:46.324
No!

01:23:52.288 --> 01:23:53.679
No.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.854
No!

01:23:54.855 --> 01:23:56.421
No, please, don't hurt him.

01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:57.422
Don't.

01:24:07.694 --> 01:24:09.565
All the
hostages have been freed.

01:24:09.566 --> 01:24:10.957
Including Mrs. Bianca Lind

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:12.742
who was previously thought dead.

01:24:12.743 --> 01:24:14.613
This will surely go down as one

01:24:14.614 --> 01:24:16.311
of the strangest episodes.

01:24:16.312 --> 01:24:18.095
On record, with
the entire nation

01:24:18.096 --> 01:24:21.229
captivated by
every twist and turn.

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:24.014
You can see the
exhaustion on their faces.

01:24:24.015 --> 01:24:26.583
A shellshocked
expression on their faces.

01:24:28.237 --> 01:24:30.325
How do you feel, Mrs. Lind?

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:50.868
Get back to work, fellas.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:24:59.703
You have a visitor, Nystrom.

01:25:01.444 --> 01:25:02.531
Who?

01:25:02.532 --> 01:25:03.750
I don't know.

01:25:09.582 --> 01:25:10.582
Bianca?

01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:13.629
Oh, wow.

01:25:25.772 --> 01:25:28.687
What are you doing here?

01:25:28.688 --> 01:25:31.082
Have you, um, heard from Gunnar?

01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:33.649
He's free, you know?

01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:34.912
He won his appeal hearing.

01:25:36.609 --> 01:25:37.609
So he's out.

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:41.787
And I'm in.

01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:43.180
Your ah,

01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:45.400
husband is okay?

01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:47.880
Christopher, he's great.

01:25:47.881 --> 01:25:49.621
He's a good man.

01:25:49.622 --> 01:25:50.797
We're all good.

01:25:53.713 --> 01:25:55.715
What are you gonna
do when you get out?

01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:59.589
Leave Sweden, I guess.

01:26:09.468 --> 01:26:11.514
Why? Hey?

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:14.908
What is it?

01:26:16.475 --> 01:26:17.911
I don't know, I just,

01:26:21.393 --> 01:26:23.961
I can't stop thinking about
what happened with us.

01:26:26.616 --> 01:26:28.095
I still have a,

01:26:29.488 --> 01:26:32.187
a scar on my back
because of you.

01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:35.146
But I'm alive.

01:26:36.582 --> 01:26:37.931
I survived.
