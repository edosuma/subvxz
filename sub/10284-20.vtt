Previously on ER...

00:04.917 --> 00:06.792
It'd help if you could
write a letter or something.

00:06.813 --> 00:09.385
- All right. What kind of work?
- An E.M.T.

00:09.641 --> 00:11.437
I'll help your brother out, no worries.

00:11.468 --> 00:14.233
- I just don't know how I fit in.
- Oh, I understand that.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.062
Well, you won't have to wait long.

00:16.463 --> 00:19.211
- So, we're still waiting?
- Oh, it's only been a week.

00:20.062 --> 00:23.313
- Well, I sent you a few e-mails.
- Never got any of them.

00:23.534 --> 00:25.751
Where are the groceries, Mike?
I gave you $100.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.170
- How much you got left?
- I don't know.

00:27.274 --> 00:29.223
Come on !
Smile for the camera, birthday girl.

00:29.277 --> 00:32.003
Ovarian cancer.
First time around.

00:32.204 --> 00:35.652
- First?
- But they say the third time's a charm.

00:36.089 --> 00:39.403
- Happy Birthday.
- I'm going to send Alex away.

00:39.467 --> 00:41.963
I just can't help but feel like
I'm giving up on him.

00:42.187 --> 00:44.291
And we both know that's not true.

01:23.006 --> 01:25.731
It was so smoky, I could barely see.

01:25.776 --> 01:29.883
The flames were eating the walls
like maggots on dead meat.

01:30.095 --> 01:31.570
So, where was the little boy?

01:31.785 --> 01:36.050
Well, I looked everywhere for him,
and when they radioed me to get out,

01:36.106 --> 01:38.340
something told me to check again.

01:38.746 --> 01:40.211
- Was he there?
- Yeah.

01:40.407 --> 01:42.990
He was behind the dresser.
He could barely breathe.

01:43.005 --> 01:44.173
- ...can I call you back in five minutes?
- And just about the time

01:44.196 --> 01:47.900
I went to get him-- boom!
The second floor caved in.

01:48.255 --> 01:50.992
- Tony, have you heard this?
- It's time for you to go to school.

01:51.196 --> 01:55.161
Well, it's teacher conferences today, and me
and Mike are having a cartoon marathon.

01:55.176 --> 01:58.423
Oh, really? Well, Mike needs to go find
a job, and you need to go to Heather's.

01:58.435 --> 02:01.933
Heather's sick, and I start
at Home Depot tomorrow.

02:04.428 --> 02:07.893
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah, great.

02:09.136 --> 02:11.121
We should recheck the K
on your diabetic in two.

02:11.136 --> 02:12.572
I did. It was 3.6.

02:12.638 --> 02:14.470
- Still ketotic?
- Yeah, but only one plus now.

02:14.498 --> 02:18.170
40-year-old female, observed a syncopal
event with transient LOC at a travel agency.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.320
Oh, damn.

02:20.676 --> 02:23.772
A & O times three, pulse 88,
resps 26, sat 96.

02:23.806 --> 02:25.912
- Well, listen to you.
- He hasn't hurt you, has he?

02:25.947 --> 02:28.343
I'm fine. I just got dizzy.

02:28.377 --> 02:30.861
All right, I'm Dr. Pratt.
We're going to take a look at you, okay?

02:31.226 --> 02:34.073
I didn't eat breakfast.
I-I just got dizzy.

02:34.725 --> 02:36.100
I want to go home.

02:36.117 --> 02:38.812
We'll try to make it quick, all right?
Just put her in curtain two, okay?

02:38.848 --> 02:40.470
I'll roll her in.
Newbie, you finish up the run sheet.

02:40.508 --> 02:41.753
No problem.

02:42.347 --> 02:44.082
- Not bad, man.
- Tight, huh?

02:44.217 --> 02:45.621
Very tight.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.243
- So, this your first day?
- Two MIs, an MVC on a Dan Ryan

02:49.258 --> 02:51.483
- and the shift's not even half over.
- How's Dumar treating you?

02:51.516 --> 02:55.100
- He's cool, man. Real cool.
- He's not giving you a hard time?

02:56.148 --> 02:58.652
He made me stock the rig
and get the coffee. But...

02:58.675 --> 03:00.942
it's not like I had to shine
the rims or anything.

03:01.155 --> 03:03.001
Just make sure it doesn't get
in the way of your school work.

03:03.038 --> 03:04.053
It won't.

03:04.187 --> 03:05.891
Hey, Pratt, you see this?

03:05.917 --> 03:08.610
Kovac is having a mandatory
department dinner next week.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.391
Now, why would I want to hang out
with you losers on my free time?

03:11.635 --> 03:16.460
Hey, it's better than the time, uh,
Weaver took us to the Olive Plantation.

03:16.577 --> 03:19.972
- Yeah, I was hugging the toilet for days.
- Okay, too much information.

03:20.007 --> 03:22.341
Hey, you guys met my brother?
It's his first day on the job.

03:22.846 --> 03:24.371
- Congratulations.
- Hey, buddy.

03:24.415 --> 03:26.153
- Heard you started today.
- Thanks for everything.

03:26.176 --> 03:28.990
You got it. Hey, be careful.
The ladies love the uniform.

03:29.185 --> 03:31.380
- We'll see.
- Look. Here.

03:31.405 --> 03:34.300
- Department dinner.
- Sounds like fun.

03:34.408 --> 03:36.072
Obviously, you haven't been.

03:36.278 --> 03:39.471
- Yeah, beats work.
- All right, all right, speaking of which--

03:39.688 --> 03:41.630
Marquez, staple gun lady in three,

03:41.648 --> 03:45.312
Sam, liter of NS and get an EKG
for the new one in two.

03:45.395 --> 03:47.251
What's this, uh, dinner all about?

03:47.305 --> 03:50.120
Well, after County's lousy
Joint Commission survey,

03:50.136 --> 03:53.593
Kovac probably just wants
to boost morale.

03:57.275 --> 03:59.203
What about emergency power
for all the rooms?

03:59.216 --> 04:00.240
We're getting to that.

04:00.256 --> 04:02.150
And the bathrooms still
aren't ADA compliant.

04:02.176 --> 04:05.213
First I need to upgrade the nurse call
systems and get automatic fire doors.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.921
Well, you'll have plenty of time
to do that when we close.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.913
- Just-Just give me another week, okay?
- I gave you a month. We're too busy.

04:09.935 --> 04:12.840
- We're busy every day.
- Soccer player has a positive culture.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.983
Start vancomycin.
Look, I haven't even prepared the staff.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.512
Well, you have the rest
of your shift to do so.

04:18.947 --> 04:20.490
What about the patients?

04:20.577 --> 04:23.871
We've increased capacity
at the urgent care clinic.

04:23.906 --> 04:27.542
- You promised shuttles to other facilities.
- We don't have enough money for that.

04:27.576 --> 04:29.721
You have no idea what
it's like to be down here.

04:29.746 --> 04:33.813
I covered trauma in this E.R. for 20 years.
We're trying to improve the way it works.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.780
- How long are you going to shut us down?
- For as long as it takes.

04:36.816 --> 04:38.612
So we can comply with trivial rules?

04:38.655 --> 04:40.932
Without accreditation,
we can't run this hospital.

04:40.977 --> 04:43.732
- Come on, Donald...
- In 12 hours, we close the E.R.

04:43.775 --> 04:45.250
End of story.

04:54.637 --> 04:56.671
You heard what he just said.
We're closing down.

04:56.718 --> 04:58.750
- It's only temporary.
- How do you know?

04:58.807 --> 05:00.851
Old boys running around here
checking for cracks in the ceiling,

05:00.908 --> 05:03.892
- and now we're having some dinner.
- Oh, we have the dinner every few years.

05:03.916 --> 05:07.482
Just drinks and dancing.
Usually you can't bring a date.

05:07.578 --> 05:10.252
- Maybe I'll bring Wilson.
- The cop?

05:10.547 --> 05:13.940
They say white men can't jump,
but he sure can...

05:15.186 --> 05:18.620
- Who you bringing?
- I... I don't know.

05:19.507 --> 05:23.080
You know, Sam, it's obvious
you got some stuff going on.

05:23.288 --> 05:26.270
You don't need to keep it all in.
Nurses stick together.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.412
No, I...
Honestly, I don't know who I'd bring.

05:31.128 --> 05:33.423
It's the first time in my life
I've really been alone.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.430
You're kidding me.

05:36.116 --> 05:39.603
No, and now that Alex is out of the house,
I got to find something to do with myself.

05:39.715 --> 05:44.320
Girl, it's called the rabbit. It costs
a grip, but it's worth every dime.

05:44.337 --> 05:45.601
Oh, God.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.430
You'll be saying more than that,
trust me.

05:49.396 --> 05:51.240
Excuse me.
Hold on.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.593
Oh... get that look off your face.

05:59.205 --> 06:02.840
- How are you?
- Mets to the...

06:04.327 --> 06:07.731
liver, lungs, bones.
Not a K... Kodak moment.

06:09.405 --> 06:12.860
- I'm sorry. Are you getting chemotherapy?
- No, I'm done.

06:13.975 --> 06:16.741
Keep him on the monitor,
and call for an ICU bed!

06:17.728 --> 06:22.231
Hi. Uh, this is Diana Moore.
She's, uh, here for syncope.

06:22.717 --> 06:25.860
- History of ovarian cancer.
- I'm Dr. Kovac.

06:26.165 --> 06:29.172
It's not history, Sam.
It's right now.

06:29.407 --> 06:32.210
Metastatic.
End stage.

06:33.316 --> 06:36.081
- Doctors need to know that.
- You two know each other?

06:36.297 --> 06:40.283
- She's been here before.
- Not as... a patient.

06:41.445 --> 06:42.943
Diana's a photographer.

06:43.077 --> 06:46.142
She's, uh, doing a project
on hospice patients.

06:46.335 --> 06:48.851
Oh, that's right, yeah.
I re... I remember you.

06:48.946 --> 06:51.433
Wow, you've got pretty
bad ascites here.

06:51.857 --> 06:54.702
Your abdominal cavity
is accumulating fluid.

06:54.946 --> 06:57.312
I know what ascites is.

06:59.396 --> 07:02.041
I took a picture of it.
It looks like I'm pregnant.

07:02.267 --> 07:05.780
- BP's 92/58.
- She's depleted intravascularly.

07:05.835 --> 07:08.471
- Okay, run in a liter of NS.
- No, no IVs.

07:08.505 --> 07:11.231
I told the paramedics, I'm D... DNR.

07:13.527 --> 07:16.800
- It's just an IV for rehydration.
- No. I know how... I know, okay?

07:16.918 --> 07:19.381
I know... I know how this starts,
and-and then you...

07:19.556 --> 07:24.252
You get sucked into the-the hospital vortex,
and it... and it never ends up well.

07:24.547 --> 07:28.251
- The fluids will make you feel better.
- No. Listen...

07:28.837 --> 07:30.351
to me. No.

07:30.536 --> 07:36.221
No IVs, no blood tests, no...
no-no monitors, no-no medicines.

07:38.406 --> 07:41.213
- I'm going to Costa Rica.
- What's in Costa Rica?

07:41.246 --> 07:42.832
The beach.

07:46.985 --> 07:50.413
Sam, give her a liter
of oral rehydration solution.

07:50.447 --> 07:53.690
Just stay long enough to show us
you can hold that down, okay?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.320
Okay.

07:57.834 --> 08:00.373
Hey, shouldn't we at least
drain some of the fluid?

08:00.407 --> 08:01.923
We can't do a paracentesis.

08:02.104 --> 08:04.622
Why? It'll help her breathe easier,
it'll make her more comfortable.

08:04.649 --> 08:06.081
You heard her-- no blood tests.

08:06.255 --> 08:09.711
It's a needle in the belly. It'll take
you five minutes. Come on, Luka.

08:09.766 --> 08:12.340
Ray's right. We can't tap
the fluid without checking labs.

08:12.376 --> 08:15.412
She could be dangerously anemic,
coagulopathic-- not a good idea.

08:15.446 --> 08:18.331
She doesn't want any treatment, Sam,
so let's respect that, all right?

08:18.748 --> 08:21.522
Luka, your favorite skin popper
won't let me I & D her abscess.

08:21.578 --> 08:23.800
- Sign her out AMA and get her out of here.
- Yeah, but she knows you.

08:23.816 --> 08:25.101
- Maybe if you could talk to her...
- No.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.672
We can't keep convincing people
to stay if they don't want to be here.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.153
We can't even take care of
the ones we already have.

08:30.817 --> 08:32.092
Okay, listen up.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.943
We got reassignments for all
of you during the E.R. closing.

08:35.005 --> 08:36.679
How are they just going
to tell us this today?

08:36.865 --> 08:39.431
I thought I could prevent this,
but Anspaugh's not budging.

08:39.476 --> 08:41.623
- How long are we shutting down for?
- I'm not sure.

08:41.765 --> 08:44.522
Great. I'm sure I'll wind up
giving enemas in Geriatrics.

08:44.548 --> 08:47.682
No, you're going to ICU.
Malik, Geriatrics.

08:47.715 --> 08:50.060
Pratt, Family Medicine.
Abby, you're going to the NICU.

08:50.075 --> 08:52.213
I'm not going to the NICU.

08:52.526 --> 08:56.651
Right. I'll, uh, fix that.
Uh, Gates goes to Anesthesia.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.703
- What about me?
- You're going to the cafeteria.

08:58.735 --> 08:59.972
Cafa-what?

09:00.076 --> 09:02.323
Oh, why don't they just give me a jockey
suit and sit me out on the lawn?

09:02.346 --> 09:05.482
- Well, do we get to keep the same shifts?
- Will we still get our choice of schedule?

09:05.506 --> 09:08.261
Uh, you'll have to talk to your
supervisors about shift scheduling.

09:08.307 --> 09:10.472
Well, give it to us straight.
Are they going to shut down the residency?

09:10.506 --> 09:13.190
These are just alternate rotations
until the E.R. opens again.

09:13.216 --> 09:15.381
Yeah, that's what they told
the residents at MLK in Los Angeles.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.320
And now they're scrambling
for spots in other programs.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.371
No. Our didactic programs
for the residents will continue,

09:20.386 --> 09:22.890
and for our attendings, there'll
be some administrative duties

09:22.916 --> 09:24.803
to help correct the JC deficiencies,

09:24.836 --> 09:28.153
and we'll also be assigned clinical shifts
in the urgent care center, okay?

09:28.346 --> 09:32.711
- Great. Med refills, URIs and back pain.
- Yeah. I bet we're closing for good.

09:32.748 --> 09:35.750
I'm with you. Something stinks,
and it's not the diarrhea in four.

09:35.807 --> 09:37.842
Uh, who has Johnson?

09:38.198 --> 09:39.162
Oh, I did.

09:39.267 --> 09:41.902
No pneumonia, but are you aware
he has multiple rib fractures?

09:41.936 --> 09:46.032
- Yeah, the kid plays rugby.
- So, uh, guess who's, uh...

09:50.476 --> 09:53.851
- Guess who's going to Family Medicine?
- I don't know. Who?

09:54.018 --> 09:57.432
Yours truly.
No nights, no weekends. Now...

09:57.478 --> 10:01.490
maybe you can come over for some dinner.
We can crack open a bottle.

10:01.715 --> 10:04.681
- You know?
- Yeah, maybe.

10:04.936 --> 10:08.952
Hey, Betina, I saw your abstract
on neuroimaging and autism.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.383
Pretty cool stuff.

10:10.616 --> 10:12.962
Paper's coming out
in Neuroscience next month.

10:12.977 --> 10:15.901
Wow. Very impressive.
But not surprising,

10:15.945 --> 10:19.663
considering you managed to enroll
such a big cohort of autistic children.

10:19.707 --> 10:23.262
And the way you correlated the MRI
findings with the tissue specimens...

10:23.465 --> 10:26.072
I mean, no one's ever done
that on this scale before.

10:26.207 --> 10:28.290
- You actually read it?
- I sure did,

10:28.336 --> 10:31.312
and if you ever have time to talk
about it more, I'd love to chat.

10:31.497 --> 10:34.430
I'm looking for some areas to focus
clinical research in the E.R.

10:34.477 --> 10:36.411
I'd be interested in collaborating
with your department.

10:36.557 --> 10:39.833
- Are you free for lunch tomorrow?
- Sounds great.

10:40.055 --> 10:42.071
Okay, great.

10:46.177 --> 10:47.440
What just happened?

10:47.627 --> 10:50.591
Blunt trauma to the head and arms.
Assaulted with a baseball bat.

10:50.675 --> 10:52.411
- Alert times three.
- Got it.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.592
- Okay, put him in trauma one.
- What happened?

10:54.638 --> 10:58.420
I was at a sci-fi convention, and
some Romulan... ...started beating me!

10:58.458 --> 11:00.112
Get a C-collar.

11:00.296 --> 11:03.802
He accused us Intergalactic Rebel
Warriors of being inferior.

11:04.008 --> 11:07.851
He was just being uppity, 'cause Romulans
are biological cousins to Vulcans.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.532
- Of course.
- Where is your pain?

11:09.577 --> 11:12.203
Mostly in my shoulder.
My arm hurts, too.

11:12.235 --> 11:14.340
Okay, let's get a line in,
get him some morphine.

11:14.378 --> 11:17.070
And a C-spine film to his right
shoulder and left forearm.

11:17.086 --> 11:18.421
It hurts.

11:19.237 --> 11:21.852
Well, you dislocated
your shoulder anteriorly.

11:22.086 --> 11:25.291
- Am I going to die?
- Not... today.

11:29.557 --> 11:32.150
- Have you seen that patient?
- She stumbled off, so did my doctor.

11:32.175 --> 11:33.992
- Can you find him?
- Yeah, I'll send someone over.

11:34.005 --> 11:36.772
Today? Next year?
During Cinco de Mayo? When?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.552
- Have you seen Diana?
- Who the hell is that?

11:38.577 --> 11:40.581
The photographer lady,
she was in curtain two.

11:40.608 --> 11:43.060
- Sam, where are the glucometers?
- They're all packed up.

11:43.105 --> 11:44.643
They were supposed to leave
one in the trauma room.

11:44.677 --> 11:46.461
- And the test strips?
- Uh, you're on your own.

11:46.507 --> 11:49.381
I get that Klingons used to be
enemies of the Federation,

11:49.408 --> 11:52.491
- but we have nothing to do with that.
- Okay, move your toes.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.491
- Good. Can you feel me touching your foot?
- Yes.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.132
I never heard of Intergalactic
Rebel Warriors.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.872
- What show were you on?
- We're still in the conceptual stage,

12:00.908 --> 12:03.372
- but we're about to land a deal.
- Looks like you're right.

12:03.405 --> 12:06.582
- Anterior shoulder dislocation.
- C-spine is clear.

12:06.607 --> 12:09.222
And he's got a nightstick fracture of the left ulna.

12:09.246 --> 12:12.513
- Okay, let's get a sugar tong splint.
- Let's give him, uh, 100 of Propofol...

12:12.538 --> 12:14.602
- ...for his shoulder reduction.
- Propofol?

12:14.638 --> 12:16.532
Yeah, I just got credentialed to use it.

12:16.606 --> 12:18.992
Why don't we try, uh,
scapular manipulation, you know?

12:19.008 --> 12:20.563
Put it in without having
to knock him out.

12:20.605 --> 12:23.030
No, n-no, reductions are much easier,
if you have good sedation.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.423
Sedation has risks.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.512
Morris, I need you to dispose
some patients out here.

12:26.535 --> 12:28.543
We got a full waiting area, and
the clock is ticking. Come on.

12:28.768 --> 12:31.382
Okay, uh... let's get set up
for the Propofol,

12:31.397 --> 12:33.440
and we'll do the reduction
when I get back.

12:33.708 --> 12:37.191
All right, let's get him prone, and
we'll try the scapular manipulation.

12:37.835 --> 12:40.440
W-- He--
Morris said he wants to use sedation.

12:40.555 --> 12:42.932
- He's a kid with a new toy.
- Well, the kid's the attending,

12:43.008 --> 12:44.673
so even if you're right,
you have to talk to him about it.

12:44.777 --> 12:47.591
If it goes in easy, great.
If not, then we'll try the Propofol.

12:47.615 --> 12:48.960
Let me roll you over.

12:52.588 --> 12:55.831
Hey... I've been looking
all over for you.

12:57.638 --> 13:00.903
I got to get an airline ticket
before the price goes up.

13:00.918 --> 13:03.502
Come here.
Come on, sit down, please.

13:10.468 --> 13:12.621
I had malaria once.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.602
I didn't feel...

13:17.655 --> 13:19.182
as bad as this.

13:21.465 --> 13:25.353
Look, the fluid in your belly
is compressing your lungs.

13:25.375 --> 13:29.050
If you let us take some of it off,
it'll make it easier for you to breathe.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.611
I just want to get o-on the plane.

13:32.027 --> 13:33.601
I understand that...

13:34.685 --> 13:38.210
okay? But you are breathless
and you're pale,

13:38.487 --> 13:41.680
and flight crews are trained
to spot people just like you.

13:43.548 --> 13:45.193
I'll wear blush.

13:47.306 --> 13:49.250
The paracentesis will only
take a few minutes.

13:49.277 --> 13:50.443
Sam...

13:52.046 --> 13:55.532
I have friends i-in Costa Rica...

13:57.077 --> 13:58.810
And they're waiting for me.

14:00.088 --> 14:01.873
And it's all planned out.

14:04.717 --> 14:07.400
This is your only chance to get there.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.863
Come on, trust me on this.

14:19.408 --> 14:22.673
- ICU has beds for our intubated patients.
- Well, there are only three stepdown beds,

14:22.688 --> 14:24.000
but these others can go to telemetry.

14:24.016 --> 14:27.663
Yeah, we have 11 patients going to medicine.
They can use the GYN floor for overflow.

14:27.685 --> 14:30.173
- Uh, what about the waiting room?
- Send them to urgent care.

14:30.207 --> 14:31.543
The E.R. is closing at 8:00.

14:31.608 --> 14:35.110
How do you say "This is going to hurt"
in Intergalactic Rebel Warrior?

14:35.808 --> 14:38.002
- What the hell are you doing?
- He did it.

14:38.148 --> 14:40.162
- What?!
- Gates thought he'd try it this way.

14:40.206 --> 14:42.842
Yeah, and it worked.
No need for Propofol.

14:42.877 --> 14:45.840
- Well, who made that call?
- I did. His shoulder's back in.

14:45.878 --> 14:47.623
That's not the point;
I gave you an order.

14:47.675 --> 14:50.632
So do what a boss does.
Take credit for my resourcefulness.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.831
I'm writing you up.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.191
Why, because my approach was better
than the attending?

14:55.206 --> 14:56.882
Go home; you're done.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.500
You can't send me home.

15:02.525 --> 15:04.250
You should have thought about
that before, cowboy.

15:04.307 --> 15:06.773
- I helped the guy without sedation.
- You went against my orders.

15:06.807 --> 15:08.831
- Oh, come on, Morris.
- You're supposed to be a soldier.

15:08.855 --> 15:11.512
- I am a soldier. A real one.
- Could have fooled me.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.170
Y-You're acting like I killed the guy.

15:13.207 --> 15:16.280
I am sick and tired of you not taking
orders. In the time that you got here,

15:16.308 --> 15:18.730
you have placed a subclavian line
without supervision,

15:18.775 --> 15:21.290
you tapped a VP shunt without
even calling neurosurgery,

15:21.316 --> 15:25.410
you overrode an attending to give Digibind
to a guy that was already brain dead...

15:25.438 --> 15:26.993
- What, you keeping score?
- You transpose numbers,

15:27.006 --> 15:28.123
- you falsify charts.
- You sound like...

15:28.177 --> 15:30.262
- you're slow as hell with documentation...
- like my high school girlfriend.

15:30.308 --> 15:33.382
And still you act like you're
God's gift to medicine,

15:33.568 --> 15:36.513
like, like you're too good
to seek advice or need help.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.673
You're arrogant and dangerous,
and I've had enough.

15:38.708 --> 15:41.211
- We all have. Go home.
- Where's Kovac?

15:42.128 --> 15:44.453
- This is my call, not his.
- Okay.

15:46.966 --> 15:49.421
- What was that about?
- I sent him home.

15:49.717 --> 15:50.921
I tried that once.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.613
Yeah, well, this time he's getting
a letter in his file.

15:57.486 --> 15:59.363
So how did you cut your leg?

16:01.018 --> 16:03.060
I was trying to get the chip out.

16:03.457 --> 16:04.883
What kind of chip?

16:06.135 --> 16:09.183
A neurogenic biomatrix nanosilicate chip.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.843
The aliens put it there.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.091
And, uh, did the aliens
do anything else to you?

16:21.688 --> 16:23.753
Not that I didn't consent to.

16:24.148 --> 16:25.111
Look...

16:25.865 --> 16:28.382
They want me to go back
and report my findings.

16:28.635 --> 16:29.712
Really?

16:29.935 --> 16:32.710
I'm willing to give them a report,
but I don't want them tracking me!

16:32.737 --> 16:35.551
Hey, Sam, can you page Psych
for a consult, please?

16:35.767 --> 16:37.990
- Katey's already down here.
- Katey?

16:44.275 --> 16:47.870
We're gonna move you to exam three
to do the procedure, and you're all set.

16:47.955 --> 16:51.430
One ticket to Costa Rica.
Tomorrow evening, 7:55.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.252
Seat 13B.

16:55.815 --> 16:59.943
- You ever been to Costa Rica?
- Only on the Discovery Channel.

17:02.077 --> 17:04.632
That's where my dad bought
me my first camera.

17:08.005 --> 17:09.579
My family lived there...

17:11.048 --> 17:15.012
when I was 15 for six months.

17:16.776 --> 17:18.410
It was very magical.

17:19.575 --> 17:22.712
Very beautiful.
The sunsets, the beaches.

17:22.747 --> 17:24.492
Sounds romantic.

17:25.886 --> 17:27.260
Yeah.

17:29.317 --> 17:31.060
It's where I met Paul.

17:34.467 --> 17:37.502
He was a journalist for the BBC.

17:38.177 --> 17:40.243
The only guy who ever got me.

17:40.607 --> 17:42.163
Is he going to meet you there?

17:43.167 --> 17:44.223
No.

17:46.278 --> 17:48.313
He died in Baghdad.

17:49.785 --> 17:54.640
He was embedded with a Marine unit,
and they drove over an IED.

17:54.785 --> 17:56.411
I'm so sorry.

17:56.856 --> 17:59.643
Sorry... yeah...

17:59.867 --> 18:02.153
I never had his kid.

18:04.997 --> 18:06.703
- What do you think?
- Please hide me.

18:06.776 --> 18:08.783
We should, uh, put her on a 72-hour hold.

18:08.808 --> 18:11.380
She cut her leg open.
She's a danger to herself.

18:11.406 --> 18:15.033
- She's a crazy bird.
- Aren't we all?

18:15.095 --> 18:18.000
My best friend thinks I'm nuts
sitting around waiting for you to call.

18:18.107 --> 18:21.752
- Okay, look, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

18:22.305 --> 18:24.301
The moment I jump in the pool,
you get out.

18:24.336 --> 18:25.483
Katey, that's not--

18:25.507 --> 18:28.062
Hey, this is Katey Alvaro,
fourth year on Psych.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.523
Do we have any beds?

18:30.188 --> 18:32.483
You know, I pulled out my best for you.

18:32.928 --> 18:35.773
Hey, don't get me wrong.
The sex was great.

18:35.905 --> 18:38.012
I'm not talking about the sex.

18:38.065 --> 18:40.451
No, that's great.
I-I'll bring her right up.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.421
- I should have called you.
- You should have call...?

18:43.688 --> 18:46.011
- You dropped off the face of the Earth.
- Okay, it was wrong.

18:46.038 --> 18:50.630
No, it was, it was more than wrong.
It was wussy, immature, tenth-gradish.

18:50.677 --> 18:51.881
You're right.

18:53.126 --> 18:54.453
What happened?

18:54.968 --> 18:57.191
You start dating Neela or something?

19:01.037 --> 19:02.580
Okay, can we talk about this?

19:02.847 --> 19:06.771
What's there to talk about?
You're stupid, and I'm done.

19:10.106 --> 19:12.330
Did Morris tell you not
to do the procedure?

19:12.367 --> 19:15.851
Well, yes, but... b-but scapular
manipulation doesn't pose any real risk.

19:15.878 --> 19:17.172
That's not the point.

19:17.395 --> 19:19.410
- I saved the guy from being sedated.
- Doesn't matter.

19:19.435 --> 19:21.911
You were out of line, and now
you're going over his head to me.

19:21.945 --> 19:24.122
My way was better, and
it doesn't merit being written up.

19:24.137 --> 19:27.461
Actually, it does. When an attending tells you
to do something, you do it or discuss it.

19:27.585 --> 19:30.492
Now you're gonna go home
and think about that, okay?

19:33.155 --> 19:35.653
- Am I, am I in trouble?
- Morris...

19:36.435 --> 19:38.181
that's one of the best moves
you ever made.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.951
See? I knew it!
He can't go against me.

19:41.007 --> 19:43.170
He shouldn't even be able
to go against residents.

19:43.206 --> 19:45.032
- There was a resident in the room?
- Uh, let's leave me out of it.

19:45.105 --> 19:47.450
- You should have stopped him.
- Oh, please, like he's going to listen to me.

19:47.475 --> 19:50.541
- He doesn't even listen to you.
- Well, maybe I should send you home, too.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.270
Okay.

19:54.878 --> 19:56.521
Well... well, not today.

19:57.416 --> 19:59.792
But I'll do it, Abby.
Don't test me.

20:03.418 --> 20:05.823
- It wasn't life threatening.
- Doesn't matter.

20:05.876 --> 20:08.583
Morris is the attending.
It's his decision.

20:13.306 --> 20:15.613
Got my Coltrane, my...

20:16.036 --> 20:20.030
Margaret Bourke-White books,
new timer for my camera.

20:20.497 --> 20:22.601
- You seem at peace.
- Yeah.

20:22.886 --> 20:24.332
Why stress this?

20:24.927 --> 20:27.860
My friend's gonna cook,
drink wine on the beach.

20:30.858 --> 20:32.312
That necessary?

20:32.335 --> 20:35.741
Uh, it's a precaution
for the invasive procedure.

20:37.167 --> 20:38.870
I-I said no blood.

20:38.906 --> 20:41.440
It's just platelets;
your count's a little low.

20:42.176 --> 20:45.660
- I'm still gonna get out of here.
- I promise you.

20:49.397 --> 20:53.023
- Platelets running, belly's prepped.
- Lido's drawn up and ready.

20:53.395 --> 20:56.002
Got to get my film to my publisher.

20:57.498 --> 20:59.530
And my camera to Yolonda.

21:00.157 --> 21:01.822
Who's Yolonda?

21:02.606 --> 21:06.661
She's a girl I mentor
in a photography... program.

21:09.066 --> 21:12.281
Okay, a little sting,
so you won't feel the big needle.

21:12.996 --> 21:15.443
- Vitals?
- A little tachy, but BP's good.

21:18.928 --> 21:19.860
Okay.

21:20.565 --> 21:23.050
You're gonna feel some pressure here.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.112
That's it.

21:29.818 --> 21:33.383
If the bottle fills up, clamp the tubing
before you switch to an empty one.

21:33.406 --> 21:34.932
Yeah, got it.

21:35.205 --> 21:37.780
I need to see if I have enough miles...

21:38.465 --> 21:39.930
to upgrade.

21:41.807 --> 21:45.350
- Why skimp on your last plane ride?
- She refused the morphine.

21:45.415 --> 21:48.351
Okay, the painful part is over, anyway.

21:49.667 --> 21:53.252
- Eh, fluid's bloody.
- Just a little; shouldn't be a problem.

21:53.316 --> 21:57.490
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

21:57.927 --> 22:00.033
I feel weird.

22:01.626 --> 22:02.832
Diana?

22:02.907 --> 22:03.920
Diana, come on.

22:03.976 --> 22:05.743
Systolic's only 84.
Get the crash cart.

22:05.777 --> 22:07.621
- Come on, Diana.
- Sam, she's DNR.

22:07.635 --> 22:08.983
No, no, no.

22:09.006 --> 22:10.591
We talked her into this,
we at least got to get her back

22:10.607 --> 22:12.182
to where she was when
she walked in here. Please?

22:12.208 --> 22:14.130
No crash cart, no CPR.

22:14.177 --> 22:16.890
Give her a liter of NS
and lower the head of the bed.

22:27.206 --> 22:29.193
BP's 88 over 45.

22:29.647 --> 22:31.542
Damn it. Urticaria.

22:31.605 --> 22:33.822
Another liter of NS
and DC the platelets, now.

22:33.836 --> 22:34.883
Crackles at the bases.

22:34.975 --> 22:37.340
50 of Benadryl and get her
on the non-rebreather.

22:37.377 --> 22:39.602
- Diana.
- What happened?

22:39.768 --> 22:41.910
You had a bad reaction to some
of the blood products.

22:41.977 --> 22:43.461
Okay, I'll start another line.

22:43.505 --> 22:46.330
Oh, no, I don't want that.
I don't want any of this.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.051
You dropped your pressure;
you have no choice.

22:48.078 --> 22:49.411
Yes, I do. Stop.

22:50.116 --> 22:52.612
- We need a way to get her fluids, fast.
- No, no.

22:52.648 --> 22:56.100
Listen to me. This is very serious.
Platelet allergy can be life threatening.

22:56.117 --> 22:58.260
- Especially in your condition.
- Great.

22:58.958 --> 23:02.252
What is it about hospitals?
It's a toxic environment.

23:02.485 --> 23:04.020
Everybody gets worse here.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.480
125 of methylpred, and have epi at the bedside.

23:06.505 --> 23:08.411
It's gonna be okay, Diana.

23:09.878 --> 23:12.542
Really?
I don't think I'm gonna be okay.

23:12.745 --> 23:16.093
- Want me to start a subclavian?
- She's coagulopathic.

23:16.116 --> 23:19.040
Let's give the meds a chance
to kick in and then reassess.

23:19.997 --> 23:22.923
Hang in there, Diana.
We'll come and check on you soon.

23:28.377 --> 23:29.851
Sam shouldn't have pushed that.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.600
That was Diana's only chance
to get on that plane.

23:31.638 --> 23:34.010
Dr. Kovac, people are asking
about this dinner thing.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.513
Morris, just tell Marquez
to officially close us to trauma.

23:36.547 --> 23:38.410
No problem. So how are we affording
such a fancy place?

23:38.435 --> 23:40.242
- It's not Ladokern, is it?
- Don't worry about it.

23:40.277 --> 23:41.911
You didn't get in bed
with a pharmaceutical company?

23:41.926 --> 23:43.203
Guys, come on, we have a lot of work to do.

23:43.215 --> 23:45.262
Say it isn't so. They're Satan.
Trust me, I know.

23:45.275 --> 23:48.633
Hey, I got a 14-year-old with altered
mental status and respiratory distress.

23:48.776 --> 23:50.823
We were walking home from rehearsal;
he said his back hurt.

23:50.857 --> 23:52.663
Then he just sat down
and stopped making sense.

23:52.676 --> 23:54.360
Please...

23:54.556 --> 23:56.451
All right, Ray, can I get a hand over
here? Come on, let's go.

23:56.515 --> 23:57.902
- What's your friend's name?
- Demitri.

23:57.928 --> 23:59.330
Does your friend have
any medical problems?

23:59.347 --> 24:00.503
I don't know.

24:01.127 --> 24:02.133
Demitri.

24:02.266 --> 24:03.832
Hey, man.
Wake up, Demitri.

24:04.006 --> 24:06.113
Wake up.
One, two, three.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.990
- Sat's only 76.
- You sure it's picking up?

24:09.005 --> 24:11.241
- Yeah, we got a good wave form.
- All right.

24:11.416 --> 24:15.293
We got shallow resps, decreased
at the bases. Throw me the bag.

24:15.305 --> 24:17.332
- Does he take any medicine?
- We're in orchestra together.

24:17.347 --> 24:18.573
We're not really friends.

24:18.636 --> 24:20.613
- Anybody call his parents?
- Yeah, Timmy's on it.

24:20.706 --> 24:22.881
Pulse is thready, tacky at 125.

24:23.025 --> 24:24.841
- You guys take any drugs?
- We don't mess with that.

24:24.877 --> 24:26.550
Okay, did he fall?
Did you guys get in a fight?

24:26.566 --> 24:27.832
He just passed out.

24:27.846 --> 24:30.581
Okay, all right, we're gonna need
to tube him-- seven-oh and a Mac two.

24:30.607 --> 24:32.132
I got access; what do you want?

24:32.177 --> 24:36.113
CBC, trauma panel, tox screen, type
and cross. Call for a portable chest

24:36.138 --> 24:39.000
and let surgery know that they need
to come down and do a trauma eval.

24:39.018 --> 24:41.141
It's not my fault, I swear.

24:41.418 --> 24:42.982
Let's get an ABG.

24:49.645 --> 24:51.522
- Didn't call me back this morning.
- What?

24:51.576 --> 24:54.231
- You didn't call me back this morning.
- Morris is such a little bitch.

24:54.297 --> 24:56.352
- What happened?
- He's sending me home.

24:56.616 --> 24:59.350
- What did you do?
- I reduced a shoulder, that's what I did.

24:59.376 --> 25:00.460
I don't get it.

25:00.476 --> 25:02.602
I was trying to do what was safest
for the patient, right?

25:02.618 --> 25:05.330
And then he shows up
a-and he pulls this big power trip.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.422
- So you went against him?
- That's not the point.

25:08.478 --> 25:11.371
- Well, it kind of is.
- Well, no, it kind of isn't. It... the point...

25:11.435 --> 25:13.283
You know what? I don't even want
to talk about it, forget it.

25:13.306 --> 25:15.272
Why don't you just tell Morris
you're sorry?

25:15.397 --> 25:17.733
- I'm not sorry.
- So what?

25:17.775 --> 25:20.911
- So what? I'm not a kiss ass.
- So you want to get written up?

25:20.955 --> 25:23.133
He doesn't have the balls
to write me up.

25:23.165 --> 25:24.633
- Neela.
- What?

25:24.735 --> 25:28.103
Since you've been ignoring Dr. Crenshaw's
pages, he asked me to read this to you.

25:28.118 --> 25:31.140
"Get your ass into the trauma room, now."

25:31.585 --> 25:33.172
- I got to go.
- Where you going?

25:33.197 --> 25:35.821
- W-What'd you have to say to me?
- Nothing. I'll call you later. Just...

25:36.227 --> 25:37.860
go apologize to Morris.

25:39.217 --> 25:40.971
- Suction!
- All right, I'm in!

25:41.006 --> 25:43.332
- Bag him up.
- Sat's are in the 70s, Pratt.

25:43.346 --> 25:46.492
- Blood gas is ugly. PH only 7.02.
- What's happening?

25:46.517 --> 25:48.403
He may have taken something
that's making him acidotic.

25:48.416 --> 25:51.372
There's no gap, but...
Hey, you know what? Listen, Todd.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.710
It's very important you tell us the truth.
Did you guys take any pills?

25:54.736 --> 25:57.230
I told you, we were
at orchestra practice all day.

25:57.407 --> 25:59.672
- I can't bag him above 80.
- That's because of this.

25:59.755 --> 26:01.271
Yikes. What is that, pneumonia?

26:01.306 --> 26:03.682
Seems unlikely without a fever,
but we got to cover it.

26:03.705 --> 26:05.251
750 of Ceftriaxone.

26:05.278 --> 26:09.210
It hurts me when you ignore my pages,
truly. It wounds me to the core.

26:09.676 --> 26:11.882
- You rang?
- Yeah, we got a 14-year-old

26:11.905 --> 26:13.912
- with severe hypoxia and this film.
- Pneumonia?

26:13.935 --> 26:16.351
H and H is back.
Hemoglobin's 6.2.

26:16.377 --> 26:18.280
- Pulmonary hemorrhage.
- That's what I'm thinking.

26:18.297 --> 26:20.621
- Any history of trauma?
- We still don't know,

26:20.646 --> 26:23.401
- and his buddy's not being too helpful.
- I told you, I don't know anything.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.522
Look, Todd, if you know something,
you got to tell us right now.

26:31.546 --> 26:34.212
- Hey, hey, Todd! Get back here!
- All right, sonosite, please.

26:34.227 --> 26:36.501
And a chest tube tray,
sterile sixes and a ten blade.

26:36.535 --> 26:38.901
What did you do to him?
What did you do to him?

26:38.916 --> 26:42.130
- Nothing, I swear.
- Yeah? Then why are you running?

26:43.486 --> 26:45.273
You know, your friend could die?

26:46.027 --> 26:48.761
- He could?
- Yes! Did you do something to him?

26:48.916 --> 26:50.680
I wanted the solo.

26:53.336 --> 26:54.581
What did you do?

26:55.237 --> 26:58.100
I kept praying he'd get sick,
but when that didn't work...

26:58.356 --> 27:01.361
We did this experiment in chemistry
where we used sulfur,

27:01.376 --> 27:03.212
and I saw what happens
when you heated it up,

27:03.245 --> 27:05.590
so I figured eating it couldn't be good.

27:06.287 --> 27:07.461
You...

27:08.686 --> 27:10.061
You put it in his food?

27:10.107 --> 27:12.321
Listen, our school orchestra
goes to Milwaukee tomorrow,

27:12.336 --> 27:15.443
and I wanted to play the solo.
I didn't mean for all of this to happen.

27:18.176 --> 27:19.642
I'm sorry.

27:22.167 --> 27:24.761
I'm sorry this didn't go
the way we wanted.

27:29.356 --> 27:33.620
Why don't you, uh... just sign me out.

27:34.437 --> 27:35.971
I have a plane to catch.

27:36.008 --> 27:40.750
Diana, you can leave, but nothing's changed.
They're not gonna let you on that plane.

27:41.556 --> 27:42.871
Well, why?

27:43.608 --> 27:45.010
We can send you home.

27:45.048 --> 27:47.113
Hospice can bring you pain medications.

27:47.128 --> 27:49.802
- No, but I'm not in pain.
- Not right now, but sometimes

27:49.827 --> 27:53.333
when people die this way, they get...
they get really uncomfortable.

27:53.347 --> 27:56.430
Well, what can you do?
Another para... paracentesis?

27:56.476 --> 27:58.462
We can't... we can't risk you bleeding.

28:02.677 --> 28:04.072
Why can't...

28:05.048 --> 28:08.111
Why can't I just fall asleep
and not wake up?

28:09.996 --> 28:12.601
You've seen this.
It doesn't always work that way.

28:16.016 --> 28:18.553
The fluid in your body
is gonna continue to build up,

28:18.576 --> 28:22.452
and as it does, it'll compress your lungs
and make it harder for you to breathe.

28:23.405 --> 28:25.301
I'll feel like I'm drowning.

28:28.557 --> 28:31.243
We're not gonna be able to get
to everyone before the E.R. closes.

28:31.278 --> 28:32.290
But what about my headache?

28:32.307 --> 28:34.630
- It could be a brain tumor.
- I can't wait till next week.

28:34.645 --> 28:36.361
I've got the mother
of all yeast infections.

28:36.376 --> 28:38.911
I'm sorry to hear that, but you'll have
to go find a doctor somewhere else.

28:38.948 --> 28:41.221
- We've got a list of local clinics here.
- How long will the E.R. be closed?

28:41.235 --> 28:43.290
- We don't know.
- We need a room!

28:43.315 --> 28:45.572
- We're closed. You guys know that.
- You got to take this.

28:45.608 --> 28:47.641
No, we can't.
Turn around and go to Good Shepherd.

28:47.675 --> 28:50.123
- No, listen, it's Dr. Pratt's brother.
- Chaz?

28:50.207 --> 28:53.431
- He kind of overdid it.
- Somebody, I'm not feeling too good.

28:53.467 --> 28:55.343
- What happened?
- Happy hour overload.

28:55.378 --> 28:57.903
- Hey, we need a gurney over here!
- Trauma Two's open.

28:57.926 --> 28:59.871
Sam, we got this.
Go give the nursing report on Diana.

28:59.896 --> 29:01.951
- We got a bed for her upstairs.
- My appendix is bursting!

29:01.978 --> 29:04.370
- She's going home.
- No, she wants to be admitted.

29:04.526 --> 29:06.183
What?
To the hospital?

29:06.205 --> 29:09.712
- No. She is not dying here.
- Sam, just make the call, okay?

29:10.877 --> 29:13.763
Hey, Sam, I got these kids
doing fence plowing.

29:13.775 --> 29:14.792
What the hell is that?

29:14.807 --> 29:17.673
A bunch of knuckleheads run full-speed
into a fence and try to break it.

29:17.727 --> 29:18.823
Do we have time to treat them?

29:18.845 --> 29:20.760
Hurry up;
they have to be out of here in an hour.

29:20.776 --> 29:21.673
- Hey, Pratt...
- Yep?

29:21.706 --> 29:23.002
You got to get to Trauma Two.

29:23.125 --> 29:24.881
- Your brother's here.
- Yeah, I know, he's working.

29:24.906 --> 29:26.742
- No, he's drunk.
- What?

29:26.775 --> 29:29.631
Demitri's parents just called.
He's got sickle cell.

29:31.315 --> 29:33.741
- You're kidding.
- At least makes sense.

29:33.776 --> 29:36.443
Yeah, means the white out
is acute chest syndrome.

29:36.747 --> 29:38.022
What's that?

29:38.047 --> 29:41.163
Um, Dr. Barnett will explain everything.
Ray, take them upstairs, okay?

29:41.176 --> 29:44.020
- Where you going?
- It's my brother.

29:46.355 --> 29:47.843
All right, let's go.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.661
I just spoke to Dr. Kovac.

29:54.615 --> 29:57.170
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

29:58.157 --> 30:00.933
It's fine, Sam.

30:01.146 --> 30:06.340
No, this isn't what you want. It's
the hospital vortex. You said it yourself.

30:06.565 --> 30:08.040
Come on, let me take you home.

30:08.075 --> 30:10.821
We'll tell your friends
to meet you there instead.

30:11.046 --> 30:13.370
It's okay.
It's okay.

30:13.586 --> 30:15.562
Don't say that. Come on.

30:17.316 --> 30:22.192
Sam, look, actually, there is no one,
okay? I-I-I just...

30:23.328 --> 30:25.330
I did my thing...

30:26.148 --> 30:27.532
my whole life.

30:27.556 --> 30:33.580
And I... I didn't develop any real
relationships, and I don't have any kids.

30:34.135 --> 30:35.373
So...

30:39.298 --> 30:40.972
Okay.

30:44.015 --> 30:46.662
But you are still not doing this here.

30:47.687 --> 30:49.363
Not like this.

30:52.916 --> 30:54.572
Sam, I can't.

30:56.276 --> 30:59.023
Look at me.
I can't do this alone.

31:03.417 --> 31:04.953
Pulse ox is dropping.

31:05.505 --> 31:07.351
- Breath sounds equal.
- Chaz, wake up.

31:07.376 --> 31:09.162
- Breathe for us, buddy. Come on.
- I have one beer.

31:09.176 --> 31:11.593
Hell, I have four beers.
But 15 shots of tequila?!

31:11.677 --> 31:13.563
- It's a paramedic tradition.
- Yeah, tradition my ass!

31:13.577 --> 31:14.693
What the hell were you guys thinking?!

31:14.707 --> 31:18.062
- Sat's only 89. He needs a tube.
- No! 15 liters oh-two by mask.

31:18.075 --> 31:19.562
That's not gonna work
if he's hypoventilating.

31:19.577 --> 31:23.692
What are you, frat boys? You guys see
people die from alcohol poisoning all the time.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.093
- Yep, he's still got a gag.
- Barely.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.311
Chaz, come on, man.
Chaz, hey!

31:28.397 --> 31:30.501
Pratt, his GCS is trending down
and so are his sat's.

31:30.516 --> 31:33.160
- We need to tube him.
- Not yet; he's arousable.

31:34.347 --> 31:36.551
- See, look at that, he's talking.
- Mac two and an eight-oh.

31:36.578 --> 31:38.032
I said no. You're not putting
a tube in my brother.

31:38.055 --> 31:39.382
Once he aspirates, it's gonna be a mess.

31:39.406 --> 31:41.941
- It's easy to extubate him later.
- I'm not putting him on a vent!

31:42.005 --> 31:45.633
Marquez, place an NG. We'll evacuate
his stomach so he can't aspirate.

31:45.677 --> 31:48.250
- That's gonna make him vomit.
- Chaz, come on, wake up, man.

31:48.305 --> 31:51.023
He better wake up or I'll kill
you guys, I swear, I'll kill you.

31:51.078 --> 31:53.521
Hey, come on. Hey, hey.

31:54.758 --> 31:55.782
Hey.

31:56.297 --> 31:58.731
- I'm sorry.
- Sat's up to 92.

31:58.966 --> 32:00.690
Good. That's good.

32:01.667 --> 32:04.702
- Let's put him on a non-rebreather.
- I'll call for a med-surge bed.

32:07.158 --> 32:08.892
This is nice.

32:09.247 --> 32:11.521
It's very... chic.

32:15.098 --> 32:16.442
Thank you.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.001
Here.

32:20.088 --> 32:21.550
Did you do all these?

32:22.037 --> 32:25.261
Uh... yeah, mostly.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.001
Some... are friends.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.470
I thought you had no friends.

32:31.605 --> 32:36.151
Well, uh, kind of friends
that you bunk with in Kabul,

32:36.178 --> 32:38.900
or let you sleep on their floor
in Marrakech.

32:40.445 --> 32:41.891
I haven't told them.

32:43.425 --> 32:44.861
Diana?

32:49.356 --> 32:51.542
They'll read about it in the obit.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.481
I bet you underestimate them.

32:59.575 --> 33:01.191
That's Paul.

33:08.446 --> 33:10.900
A week before the bomb went off.

33:11.438 --> 33:13.202
I'm sorry.

33:15.705 --> 33:17.843
Oh, here, let me help you.

33:19.778 --> 33:22.293
Yeah, got you.

33:25.806 --> 33:27.230
Sit down.

33:27.597 --> 33:29.461
You know Sam?
You don't have to...

33:31.356 --> 33:35.301
You don't have to stay.
I'm sure you have a family to go home to.

33:36.608 --> 33:40.192
Actually, uh, my son
is away at school, so...

33:41.467 --> 33:44.181
He's been, you know, having problems.

33:45.308 --> 33:46.472
A picture?

33:46.677 --> 33:48.820
- What's that?
- Picture?

33:49.417 --> 33:51.803
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

34:00.035 --> 34:01.973
Here. There's Alex.

34:02.817 --> 34:04.931
It's an old one, but he looks
pretty much the same.

34:04.967 --> 34:07.162
- Well, he's beautiful.
- Thanks.

34:11.206 --> 34:16.371
I used to think you had to chose
between family and career.

34:16.407 --> 34:19.433
By the time I figured out
you could have both,

34:19.746 --> 34:25.601
it was too late, 'cause I was...
I was already sick.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.053
Yeah, well, I got pregnant at 14,

34:30.078 --> 34:33.002
so by the time I realized
you could have a career,

34:33.226 --> 34:35.141
my kid was in preschool.

34:37.317 --> 34:39.652
So, nursing isn't what you wanted?

34:40.367 --> 34:44.242
Uh, I actually never thought
about what I wanted.

34:44.447 --> 34:46.612
Feeding Alex was the reality.

34:56.105 --> 34:58.171
It's never too late to choose.

35:01.658 --> 35:03.271
You have time.

35:06.487 --> 35:08.893
The room is ready for
Mrs. Sherman on Four South,

35:08.908 --> 35:12.411
and the surgical step down says they
will make room for our pertussis kid.

35:12.437 --> 35:14.452
Do you think it's a good idea
to put a coughing toddler

35:14.475 --> 35:16.470
in a room with a bunch
of surgical post-op patients?

35:16.507 --> 35:19.072
- No, but it's the only option.
- Dr. Kovac...

35:19.107 --> 35:21.571
- You can't send me out, Doc.
- can you sign this discharge?

35:21.606 --> 35:24.571
Look, we'll give you a taxi voucher
to get to a shelter, okay?

35:24.608 --> 35:27.772
- Oh, you know what them shelters like.
- I'm afraid that's all we can offer.

35:27.806 --> 35:29.440
You don't need to stay in the hospital.

35:29.478 --> 35:32.353
Dr. Barnett, I finished packing up
Trauma One, and I found this.

35:32.375 --> 35:34.193
Oh, it's a violin.
My patient must have left it.

35:34.207 --> 35:35.771
- I'll take care of it, thanks.
- All right.

35:35.907 --> 35:38.991
- Hey, how's he doing?
- We're going to monitor him overnight.

35:39.127 --> 35:41.702
Hey, you know if you get admitted,
you can't be a paramedic?

35:42.088 --> 35:44.002
- Is he for real?
- I'm afraid so.

35:44.027 --> 35:46.981
- Oh, hell, no.
- It's a joke. Sit your ass down.

35:47.587 --> 35:49.813
Oh! What-What happened?

35:50.298 --> 35:52.951
His first day as an EMT.
Got initiated.

35:53.076 --> 35:54.522
Damn traditions.

35:55.126 --> 35:57.131
Um, I'll be up in a sec.

35:58.655 --> 36:00.401
Hey, Betina, Betina?

36:02.268 --> 36:03.652
About earlier...

36:03.895 --> 36:06.912
I'm sorry about how I came off.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.123
"How you doing, girl?"
"Maybe we could have dinner."

36:09.348 --> 36:11.941
- "Crack open a bottle of wine"?
- Yes, yes, yes,

36:12.006 --> 36:13.992
but I do want to hear
about your research.

36:14.176 --> 36:17.162
Then you're going to have
to read up like your buddy, Morris.

36:17.475 --> 36:21.161
I'll do that, but I still want
to take you out.

36:21.677 --> 36:25.883
There's this E.R. department dinner
next week, Thursday night.

36:26.075 --> 36:27.363
An E.R. dinner?

36:27.406 --> 36:29.350
- You're kidding me.
- And I thought maybe

36:29.376 --> 36:35.272
afterwards, we could get a drink
in a bar in a public spot.

36:36.318 --> 36:38.001
Sounds better.

36:38.345 --> 36:39.920
Come on, what do you say?

36:41.328 --> 36:42.643
Call me.

36:48.718 --> 36:51.732
Hey, you forgot this.

36:52.597 --> 36:53.672
Thanks.

36:57.588 --> 36:59.383
Demitri's still not awake?

37:00.116 --> 37:02.782
Well, he's got a tough road ahead of him,

37:03.306 --> 37:05.802
but the disease did this to him, not you.

37:06.675 --> 37:07.993
You sure?

37:08.635 --> 37:10.321
Yeah, I'm positive.

37:11.458 --> 37:14.022
Sulfur doesn't make you sick,
not like this.

37:15.666 --> 37:18.413
- You know you got lucky.
- I know.

37:23.457 --> 37:27.533
Look, when the time is right,
you'll get the solo, okay?

37:29.118 --> 37:32.082
Have you ever felt, like, jealous?

37:32.675 --> 37:34.863
Wanted something someone else had?

37:38.708 --> 37:39.952
Sure.

37:41.776 --> 37:46.613
Hey, but in the end, I believe
people get what they deserve.

37:47.185 --> 37:49.332
And if you're patient, and you're committed,

37:49.868 --> 37:51.370
then you can get what you want--

37:52.367 --> 37:53.863
whatever you want--

37:55.175 --> 37:58.311
whether that means a violin solo,

37:58.676 --> 38:03.701
or a better grade, or even a girl.

38:12.836 --> 38:13.980
Sarah?!

38:16.578 --> 38:17.822
Sarah!

38:24.558 --> 38:28.200
- I didn't like Happy Feet.
- What? What kind of a kid are you?

38:28.395 --> 38:32.031
- Everybody likes Happy Feet.
- Well, I'm not everybody.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.132
- Hey, you're home?
- Yeah, I got off early.

38:35.176 --> 38:37.970
- Where you guys been?
- The video store.

38:38.176 --> 38:39.673
We ran out of movies.

38:41.245 --> 38:45.183
You know, if you want, you can join us.
We got a bunch of Jackie Chan movies.

38:45.398 --> 38:48.760
- Charlie Chan.
- Okay, Charlie Chan.

38:49.317 --> 38:52.190
Sarah, can you, uh, give
Mike and I a second to talk?

38:52.208 --> 38:53.441
Sure.

38:56.117 --> 38:58.962
- What's up?
- What's in the thermos, Mike?

39:00.105 --> 39:03.521
- I haven't been drinking.
- So, what's in the thermos?

39:03.535 --> 39:05.530
I felt like having a little
bit of orange juice.

39:05.565 --> 39:07.553
- Yeah. Prove it.
- What-- what's your problem?

39:07.576 --> 39:09.820
I don't have to prove a damn thing.
You need to relax.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.652
I need to relax? You've been
drinking while driving with Sarah?

39:12.677 --> 39:14.610
- I was not.
- Let's see.

39:14.776 --> 39:16.350
- Let go of that.
- Give me that.

39:16.448 --> 39:17.542
Let go.

39:19.115 --> 39:22.993
That's it!
I'm done with you!

39:24.865 --> 39:25.981
Tony!

39:26.987 --> 39:29.310
Come on, Tony.
It was only a little.

39:29.338 --> 39:32.440
- You're out, you're moving out.
- We just went around the corner!

39:32.476 --> 39:33.910
- I should have never let you in.
- What are you doing?

39:33.977 --> 39:37.673
- I fall for this crap every time.
- Please, Tony, listen to me.

39:37.706 --> 39:40.610
I'm done listening, too.
You're drunk.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.581
- You'll always be a drunk.
- Come on, Tony.

39:42.605 --> 39:44.132
Get out of my way.

39:44.676 --> 39:47.690
Look, I'll change, okay?
That's what you want.

39:47.717 --> 39:50.051
- Yeah, how many times have I heard that?
- Tony, what are you doing?

39:50.075 --> 39:51.873
- Stay here.
- Tony?

39:54.436 --> 39:55.592
I got a job.

39:55.616 --> 39:57.972
Yeah, and the day the rent's due,
you're going to go blow it at a bar.

39:58.006 --> 40:00.353
- That's not true.
- It's true. It's always true.

40:00.375 --> 40:02.963
And you know what else?
You weren't a fire chief.

40:03.005 --> 40:05.031
You were a second-rate captain
who got demoted

40:05.058 --> 40:06.902
because none of the other guys
wanted to go into the fire with you.

40:06.918 --> 40:08.800
- Son of a bitch.
- Face facts, old man--

40:08.815 --> 40:10.821
you killed that rookie, didn't you?

40:13.005 --> 40:16.042
You left him.
You left him burning in that building,

40:16.077 --> 40:18.040
'cause you were too out
of it to go save him.

40:18.078 --> 40:21.483
- Why don't you just face it?
- You can't talk to me like that!

40:23.908 --> 40:25.253
You killed him.

40:26.008 --> 40:27.482
You killed your career.

40:27.515 --> 40:30.783
And the only way Mom could
escape you was to die herself.

41:44.657 --> 41:46.650
You did it, Dr. Kovac.

41:47.746 --> 41:48.952
I don't like this.

41:49.005 --> 41:52.160
Hey, it's not all Mercedes and racquetball.

41:52.275 --> 41:57.560
I know that, but I'm beginning to feel like
the politics aren't worth the paycheck.

41:58.117 --> 42:01.333
First you make me fire Weaver.
Then I spend half my time in BS meetings.

42:01.378 --> 42:05.693
- I'm flooded with paperwork, and now this.
- Well, welcome to management, Luka.

42:06.318 --> 42:07.713
This isn't me.

42:08.668 --> 42:10.140
I'm resigning as Chief.

42:10.806 --> 42:14.052
Luka, part of being the boss
is being the bad guy.

42:14.105 --> 42:17.751
I'll leave that to someone else.
I just want to be a doctor.

42:18.175 --> 42:19.453
Have a good night.

42:24.945 --> 42:30.013
