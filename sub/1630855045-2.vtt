00:12.178 --> 00:14.472
<i>Kick-off of the 2030 NBA draft.</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:16.433
<i>- As improbable as it seems...</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:19.519
<i>...there's no clear-cut consensus
on the number one pick.</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:22.689
<i>Will it be the high-flying dynamo,
Damani Alexander?</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:26.693
<i>Or one of the phenomenal Bell Brothers,
Josh and Jordan Bell?</i>

00:26.818 --> 00:28.445
<i>-A pair of young superstars...</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.697
<i>...rising on the horizon, looming large.</i>

00:30.697 --> 00:34.701
<i>They chose to skip the draft festivities,
preferring to watch from home tonight,</i>

00:34.826 --> 00:37.662
<i>waiting to see what will happen.
I can only imagine the nerves...</i>

00:37.829 --> 00:39.456
<i>We were a net tied together...</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:45.086
<i>until the shots stopped falling...</i>

00:47.630 --> 00:49.382
<i>until we started losing...</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:53.845
<i>until we stopped playing together.</i>

01:37.847 --> 01:38.848
Stay focused.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.517
Hey, green, green!

01:49.442 --> 01:52.737
We’re in last place, Bron.
I gotta make the plays.

01:53.321 --> 01:57.283
This losing stuff has me dazed.
I... I gotta be fearless, face defeat,

01:57.283 --> 02:00.370
and keep shootin'. Show grit
that's pure hot and deep-rooted.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.373
- If you can hear me, King James...

02:04.165 --> 02:08.211
- ...please banish this cold streak.
- And bless JB with an early release

02:08.378 --> 02:12.590
- of the LeBron 21s. Size nine. Amen.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.264
- Look, man, I stank tonight.
- Come on, man. You balled. It’s one game.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.976
Four games. Four!
And if we lose the next one,

02:22.976 --> 02:24.894
that means goodbye
to Beacon Academy,

02:24.894 --> 02:27.814
goodbye to the NBA,
and goodbye to our future.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.025
I won't have a future if I don't turn in
my assignment. Just cool out.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.653
Man, I'm talking
about our lifelong dreams ending

02:33.653 --> 02:34.863
if we don't win this week...

02:34.988 --> 02:37.115
- ...and you say cool out?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.659
See, that's what I'm talking about
right there.

02:39.909 --> 02:43.079
What's the common denominator
of this cold streak?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.082
- Your little girlfriend.
- You're blaming Alexis for losing?

02:46.082 --> 02:49.377
Think about it. She comes back to school,
and then what? Bang! We losing?

02:49.377 --> 02:54.090
- You are wild, bro. Are you jealous?
Look, all I'm saying is maybe,

02:54.257 --> 02:57.260
just maybe,
you've upset the basketball gods.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.555
It's called the King James Bible,
but LeBron is not your savior, all right?

03:00.555 --> 03:04.058
You got jokes
but the game is sacred, man.

03:04.058 --> 03:07.562
- Sometimes, it demands a sacrifice.
- You sound crazy.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.734
- Yo, are y... Are you good? You s...
- Hey, look.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.154
Just worry about the game, all right?
I got me covered just fine.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.893
<i>Hey, you. What's up?
How's your night going?</i>

03:48.269 --> 03:49.395
Better now.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.066
<i>I knew the strong ones
had a little magic in their souls.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:55.068
<i>Persevered. Never quit.</i>

03:55.235 --> 03:58.988
<i>Because they saw the unseen,
chased the impossible,</i>

03:58.988 --> 04:01.741
<i>believed in something greater
than themselves,</i>

04:01.741 --> 04:03.826
<i>and had the faith
that they could be great too.</i>

04:04.577 --> 04:07.538
<i>That's what I wanted. What I needed.</i>

04:15.380 --> 04:17.131
Caught you leaning. Watch the hips.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.259
Man can't move without his hips.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.136
Hips don't lie. Am I right?

04:22.136 --> 04:25.014
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.142
- Filthy! You got Gillespie’d!
- Yo, what that mean?

04:28.810 --> 04:31.813
Once upon a time, somebody knocked over
Dizzy Gillespie's horn,

04:31.813 --> 04:33.273
- and it bent the bell.
- Oh.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.318
- Zuma bent you like Dizzy's bell.
- What? He was fouling me all night, okay?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.279
And the refs clearly forgot
how to use their whistles.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.282
All right. Come on, now.
You gotta give him credit, okay?

04:42.282 --> 04:46.077
- He put a spell on y'all. He hexed you.
- Dang, Dad. Have some faith in us.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.496
Faith is fine,
but you gotta put in the work.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.914
Faith without works is dead.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.375
Chuck. Be easy.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.421
All right, look. We're in a hole,
but we can climb out.

04:57.130 --> 05:03.052
Still get back in the race. One win,
and we back in. Say it. "One win...

05:03.344 --> 05:04.762
- One win...
-"...and we back in."

05:04.762 --> 05:06.597
- ...and we back in.
- One win and we back in.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.601
Good morning, Maya.
- Good morning.

05:10.601 --> 05:14.230
I hope you're hungry.
We are overflowing in flapjacks.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.569
Oh, take some home for your dad, too.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.325
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just a long week.

05:26.909 --> 05:27.910
Hmm.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.829
- Maya.
- Yeah?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.497
Now you tell me, is that D?

05:32.874 --> 05:36.794
- Like, "D" for dancing? Like...
- Uh. Slide to the left.

05:36.794 --> 05:40.006
- Hey! Now slide to the right.
- Now, where is your head at, JB?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.091
Yo, it's probably on his girlfriend.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.384
- Girlfriend?

05:45.053 --> 05:47.972
- My man. How she look?
She fine.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.140
Ooh!

05:50.558 --> 05:52.352
How long have you had a girlfriend?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.853
Who said you could have a girlfriend?

05:53.853 --> 05:56.814
And how do you have time for a girlfriend
when you don't have time for homework?

05:56.939 --> 06:00.526
- I got time for both. It’s cool.
- I am privy to your progress reports.

06:00.651 --> 06:04.030
So, no, it's not "cool."
You do not have time for both.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.115
She's a girl, all right? It's not a crime.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.952
Until your grades are up,
you do not have a girlfriend. Understand?

06:11.496 --> 06:12.830
A social life is a perk

06:12.830 --> 06:16.042
as long as you taking care of business
in school and on the court.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.127
Yeah, we can get you help
if you need help.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.046
But you cannot fall so far behind, JB.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.048
Can I just go?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.593
- Please?
- Go.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.889
Get...

06:30.306 --> 06:32.016
You need to get a handle on that.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.518
- Honey, honey.
- He is spiraling.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.061
Listen, he's gonna be okay.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.566
I got an appointment, babe.
I don't wanna be late.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.902
- You want me to come?
- Mm-mm. I'm good.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.737
You s...

06:50.118 --> 06:54.205
<i>Basketball rule
number two. Work smart, live smarter.</i>

06:54.205 --> 06:55.623
Oh! Let's go!

06:55.748 --> 06:57.041
<i>Play hard, practice harder.</i>

06:57.041 --> 06:58.000
All right. Here we go.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.919
<i>Honor the greatness inside you.</i>

06:59.919 --> 07:01.629
<i>- Believe in the process.</i>
- Can I come in?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.840
<i>Rejoice at the result.</i>

07:05.258 --> 07:07.510
- Yo!

07:07.635 --> 07:09.554
- What's your problem, bro?
- Mom won't let me see Alexis

07:09.679 --> 07:11.305
'cause you had
to open your big, old mouth.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.099
Hey, yo, I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was a secret.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.435
(OVER PHONE) <i>I live rent free
in Filthy's head.</i>

07:15.435 --> 07:16.686
<i>He can't make a move</i>

07:16.686 --> 07:18.938
<i>without thinking about me first.
I played this dude my whole life.</i>

07:18.938 --> 07:20.773
<i>He's never beat me.</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:22.108
<i>If he's filthy, then I'm dirty.</i>

07:22.233 --> 07:24.277
- Why is he like this?
- You clowned him in fourth grade.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.156
He brought a guinea pig to show and tell.
Everybody clowned him.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.993
Oh, snap. Dude, the coach
from Beacon Academy just liked the post.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.369
- Coach Howard?
Yeah.

07:34.328 --> 07:39.459
Oh, my God. How can this get any worse?
I've been doing everything I possibly can.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.838
Been praying to whoever will listen.
I guess they're not hearing me.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.758
Look, I know what I gotta do.
It's time to get drastic.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.677
Wait. Drastic how?

07:51.262 --> 07:53.097
- Magic.
- Johnson?

07:53.764 --> 07:56.726
No. Not no Magic Johnson. Magic, magic.

07:57.185 --> 08:01.230
Look, I heard of a priest who said
the Pelicans were cursed.

08:01.230 --> 08:07.612
And if they can get cursed, so can we.
Which is why I think we need voodoo.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.531
- I'm not about to play with you.
- Bro, what are you talking about?

08:10.656 --> 08:14.202
<i>Talking about benediction,
as in, getting back in the good graces.</i>

08:15.828 --> 08:17.788
-  Maybe he is cursed.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.832
<i>And unblocking the blessings.</i>

08:19.957 --> 08:21.667
Can't shoot for nothing! Golly.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.377
<i>As in Filthy gets his groove back.</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:29.967
Chuck.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.428
Sorry to bring you in so abruptly.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.764
Tell me something good, Doc.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.518
I wish I could. Your numbers
have nearly doubled since I last saw you.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.895
And like I said during your initial visit,

08:41.270 --> 08:44.315
controlling your diabetes
was going to be a key factor.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.775
Right.
- Right now,

08:45.775 --> 08:47.527
you're looking at renal failure.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.949
We'll run more tests,
but a transplant may be imminent.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.619
-  A tra...
- Listen, it could be six years.

08:56.744 --> 09:00.122
It could be six months.
But I won't mince words, Chuck.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.457
This is dire.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.335
I'd like to discuss options.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.013
- Bro, it is hotter than a fire ant's butt

09:16.138 --> 09:17.682
and you got us walking to a voodoo store?

09:17.807 --> 09:19.141
- Yup.
- You're buying beignets.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.978
Hey, Alexis. You will not believe

09:21.978 --> 09:24.772
- what Filthy got us walking to.
- You really think this is a good idea?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.774
I mean, if you have a better one,
I'm all ears.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.611
Voodoo isn't a joke. There's no shortcut
for solving real-life problems.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.696
Trust me on that.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.699
Doesn't your dad light a candle, like,
every day in the hopes that your mom

09:34.699 --> 09:37.076
will find her way home?
Isn't that some kind of magic?

09:37.201 --> 09:40.454
She's not coming back,
no matter how many candles he lights.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.958
- Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I...
- Just don't put all your faith in magic.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.084
This is real-life.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.714
<i>Maya the Defiant.</i>

09:49.880 --> 09:54.051
<i>Sometimes, it was endings with her,
other times it was sunsets.</i>

09:54.719 --> 09:57.221
<i>She reminded me of what it meant
to face defeat.</i>

09:57.513 --> 09:59.348
<i>To lose big, and to keep going,</i>

09:59.348 --> 10:02.226
<i>even when the past tried to drag you down
like an anchor.</i>

10:14.405 --> 10:16.949
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the House of Voodoo.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.701
We got all your voodoo needs.

10:18.701 --> 10:22.622
Spells, curses, rabbit's feet, potions, keychains.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.416
You got anything to help me sleep?

10:25.708 --> 10:28.336
- Yeah, whiskey.
-  Are you for real?

10:28.336 --> 10:30.796
It's the French Quarter.
Age ain't but a number.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.431
Hey, Maya. Look,
they got love potions if you need one.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.602
If I need a love potion for someone,
they're not worth it.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.859
Yo, what is wrong with you?
And what are we here for anyway?

10:53.361 --> 10:57.657
Um. Victory oil? Ah, good luck balm?

10:58.866 --> 11:02.536
To be honest with you
my sweet, sweet brother, I don't know.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.955
But I will when I see it.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.671
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Found what you're looking for?

11:13.381 --> 11:15.925
Uh... Yeah. Yeah.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.971
<i>If he's filthy then I'm dirty.</i>

11:24.141 --> 11:25.518
A Zuma doll.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.103
Use your legs, bro. Come on.

11:29.855 --> 11:30.856
Come on.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.900
- Oh!

11:32.900 --> 11:34.402
Yeah!
- Oh!

11:36.529 --> 11:39.740
- RKO out of nowhere.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.200
- You can't see me.
- You can't see him.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.044
You know, this thing
is surprisingly well-made.

11:53.045 --> 11:57.133
- How'll we know if it works?
- I don't really know, but that was fun.

11:58.843 --> 11:59.844
It's your dad.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.932
I went to the doctor's,
and the news wasn't that good.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.268
I need to leave something for you.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.110
Basketball rules of life.

12:16.694 --> 12:20.364
Basketball rule number one.
"The ball is your heart."

12:22.533 --> 12:25.035
You auditioning
for the <i>Real Househusbands of New Orleans?</i>

12:26.537 --> 12:28.330
- Hey, babe.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.583
Well, wife's rule number one is

12:30.583 --> 12:32.543
clean the skillet
after you make flapjacks.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.213
What are they doing?

12:36.213 --> 12:40.342
Long as nothing breaks,
I don't wanna know. Are you okay?

12:42.094 --> 12:44.221
- Yeah, I'm just tired.
Hmm.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.182
What'd your doctor say?

12:46.182 --> 12:50.561
She said that I should be more attentive
to my beautiful, hardworking wife.

12:51.353 --> 12:54.064
- That's what she said?
- Mm-hmm. Why don't you come here?

12:54.732 --> 12:57.151
And what you gonna do?
- Uh. Maybe I'll give you

12:57.151 --> 13:01.238
one of them famous Chuck Bell
karate-grip foot massages.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.699
You don't have to ask me twice.

13:08.579 --> 13:13.584
So, how's that...
...dream job treating you?

13:14.043 --> 13:18.672
Nobody tells you with great power
comes great piles of paperwork.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.424
- Mm-hmm.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.511
Problem is, what I'm good at,
there's no time for.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.306
Yeah, I haven't had a moment to sit down
with my family.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.226
Hmm. Baby, you're gonna find the balance.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.436
I hope so.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.687
Oh!

13:33.813 --> 13:35.397
- Knock it off!
- Knock it off!

13:36.649 --> 13:40.486
I'm crunkin'. Criss-crossin'.
Flossin'. Flippin'.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.655
Taking left then flippin'.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.783
Stop on a dime, dippin'. Watch out!

13:45.950 --> 13:49.328
Gonna leave you slippin'
while I swoop in for the finish. Swish!

13:50.371 --> 13:52.581
Money!

13:52.998 --> 13:54.500
Give this man a new wallet.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.629
Remember when you was two,
and I taught you the game?

13:59.129 --> 14:01.298
Man, your mom thought I was crazy.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.218
You had a ball in one hand,
a bottle in another.

14:05.636 --> 14:09.181
I was crazy.
I was crazy about my twin boys.

14:11.016 --> 14:14.770
Son, you is a straight baller.
Come here. Come on.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.689
- Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad.
- Come here, boy.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.195
- Dad, what's going on?
- What? You too big for a hug?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.866
Yes. But real talk.

14:28.075 --> 14:32.830
I know you had a doctor's appointment.
Is everything okay? Like, you're not sick

14:32.830 --> 14:34.373
- or anything like that, right?
- No.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.501
Your old man is just getting old.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.132
Hey, ball your next game.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.848
Boy.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.189
I mean, school sucks. Basketball sucks.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.483
- Not seeing you sucks.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.819
Wait. So, she won't let you see me at all?

15:04.194 --> 15:06.697
Nope. Not until I get my grades up.

15:07.948 --> 15:11.410
Well, just tell her we're studying.
I mean, she'd like that, right?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.954
Think about it.
Then we could hang out more.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.040
Dang, I miss you.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.167
...he beat me to the summit,
then we have the Renaissance...

15:18.167 --> 15:19.752
- Your mom.
Hey!

15:20.836 --> 15:23.297
- You can't do everything.
- I can't?

15:23.422 --> 15:27.509
You know you can lean on me. I mean,
I am your Vice P. I got your back.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.553
Hey, why don't you
delegate some tasks my way?

15:29.678 --> 15:31.513
I'm more than qualified.

15:31.513 --> 15:35.726
He is. He's been Vice Principal for,
is it five years? Right, Basil?

15:36.268 --> 15:38.062
- Yes, Janice.
- Mm-hmm.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.315
I know we haven't spoken
about my promotion.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.026
Doesn't matter.
Best candidate got the job. Period.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.569
- Mm-hmm.
- I got you.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.782
Just consider me your Vice Princi-pal.

15:50.115 --> 15:55.996
Magic realism and speculative fiction.
Artists like Octavia Butler

15:56.121 --> 15:57.665
- and Gabriel Garcia Marquez...
Yeah.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.501
...use the genre
to elevate people of color.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.254
Words open doors to new worlds,
to better tomorrows.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.675
They allow faith to overwhelm fear.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.929
And when you doubt, it allows belief.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.975
You have to believe that magic is real.

16:16.600 --> 16:21.230
So, in the <i>Parable of the Sower,</i>
what does that mean to you?

16:22.523 --> 16:23.524
Alexis?

16:23.983 --> 16:27.444
The main character is empathetic
and feels others' literal pain.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.782
She's lost, but she trusts her instincts.

16:32.449 --> 16:36.078
Her voice is her instrument.
Her passion becomes her drive.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.330
Nice.
- Oh.

16:38.789 --> 16:42.042
So, she has superpowers like Iron Man.
He's dope.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.502
JB, we raise our hands.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.297
Okay. So, your outlines
for the passion project

16:47.589 --> 16:50.926
- are due one week from today.
- Great. More work. Dope.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.220
Hey, Ms. Rojas-Pierre, you like Iron Man?

16:53.345 --> 16:55.848
He took his disability
and made it his superpower.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.852
No, Wolverine's better.
He got healing powers, baby. He can't die.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.478
Okay. Let's focus.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.982
He had an arc reactor for a heart.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.066
- Yo.
Yo!

17:06.066 --> 17:08.736
- Chill out, bruh.
- JB, this is your last warning.

17:08.861 --> 17:13.115
Have you seen the Avengers movies?
They are dope. Yo, <i>Infinity War?</i> Yo!

17:13.407 --> 17:15.534
- Sit down, JB.
- You are bugging, Maya.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.411
- Thanos was like what?
Okay. That is enough.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.330
Mr. Bell, you already got
your last warning. You go. Now.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.761
- Ma.
- Detention, JB? Seriously?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.596
You put Ms. Rojas-Pierre in that position?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.514
- Mom, it wasn't that seri...
- Dr. Bell.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.808
And there is never a time for disrespect.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.644
Certainly never with a teacher.
One infraction point.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.189
- Mom.
- Dr. Bell.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.691
I mean, imagine if your mom was here.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.575
I am horrified. Mortified, Dr. Bell.

17:56.575 --> 18:01.288
I promise it will never happen again.
To be sure, I'm taking his phone.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.706
- Mom!

18:04.249 --> 18:05.375
Dr. Bell.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.799
You stopped taking your medication,
didn't you?

18:13.759 --> 18:14.843
JB.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.056
It was just for a month or so.
I was doing fine, then...

18:19.056 --> 18:24.436
No, no, no, no. Listen to me, JB.
Your ADHD is not going away.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.648
You will be dealing with this
for your entire life.

18:27.648 --> 18:31.318
I don't wanna be this way, Mom.
I hate taking the pills.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.112
They make me feel dead inside.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.868
Okay. Okay.
Well, we'll talk to your doctor.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.372
And we'll get you a tutor.
Whatever you need.

18:45.749 --> 18:49.545
I should have known.
I... I mean, I saw you flailing.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.131
- I guess I was just too busy...
It's not your...

18:52.256 --> 18:54.007
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, Mom.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.968
I just wanna be okay.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.012
You will. We all will.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.813
Sorry, Dr. Bell.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.692
Boy, call me Mom.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.614
But only when we're alone, okay?

19:21.034 --> 19:25.789
<i>What do I bring to Beacon next year?
That's easy. Showtime, baby.</i>

19:26.415 --> 19:30.502
<i>Oh, I see one of my biggest fan boys
is watching the live. Whaddup, Filthy?</i>

19:30.794 --> 19:32.921
<i>Hey, Filth, the court is mine.</i>

19:33.547 --> 19:36.842
<i>This season, next season.</i>
<i>I am that guy.</i>

19:37.342 --> 19:40.387
<i>Hey, actually, I should be asking Filthy
this question directly.</i>

19:40.512 --> 19:42.181
<i>Who thinks he should join my live?</i>

19:42.347 --> 19:46.185
He's just one dude, yo. There's gonna be
a bunch of Zumas in your life, all right?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.563
So what? Let this clown
keep talking trash?

19:49.813 --> 19:52.482
Nah. Use your superpower and light him up.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.611
Filthy style. Hey, give me the phone.
Come on.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.909
Hey, real talk. You don't want none
of this smoke, Zuma.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.869
 <i>I don't want that knotty haircut.</i>

20:03.994 --> 20:07.873
<i>You wanna talk about hair?
You know you jealous of my mane, man.</i>

20:08.123 --> 20:10.000
Mm!
-  Look, if my hair was a tree

20:10.000 --> 20:11.126
You'd climb it

20:11.251 --> 20:15.547
You'd kneel down beneath and enshrine it
Every day before school, I unwind it

20:15.672 --> 20:17.841
<i>And right before games, I entwine it</i>

20:17.966 --> 20:21.470
These twists on my head, I designed it
That mop on your head

20:21.470 --> 20:22.721
- We decline it
- We decline it

20:23.138 --> 20:27.309
<i>Say what you want, man, I don't mind it
Just know I got gold</i>

20:27.434 --> 20:29.019
<i>-You still mining it!</i>
<i>You still mining it!</i>

20:29.186 --> 20:31.897
- Oh!  Hey, good job, man.
- Yeah!  Get it!

20:46.370 --> 20:49.122
<i>I mean, she'd like that, right?
Think about it.</i>

20:59.216 --> 21:00.467
You getting really good.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.262
Just pop over? You can't text?

21:04.054 --> 21:07.099
My fault. My mom took my phone.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.976
And I'm sorry for trippin'
in English class like that.

21:08.976 --> 21:12.145
It's like my mind gets all twisted,
and I can't stop.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.189
Come sit.

21:18.068 --> 21:22.990
When I get all twisted, I write music.
It helps. What helps you?

21:25.867 --> 21:26.868
Nothing really.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.329
I'll help you, JB.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.253
Nobody sees me... except you.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.757
Are you okay?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.473
I have ADHD.

21:50.726 --> 21:55.188
I'm supposed to take meds, but...
it makes me all dizzy, and I can't sleep.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.317
So, I stopped and I figured
I can handle things on my own.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.362
- And my mom found out...
- It's okay. I'm right here.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.043
That song you were playing...

22:43.070 --> 22:46.948
I...
I googled your doctor.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.243
You're going to see a kidney specialist?

22:51.495 --> 22:54.164
- Dad, a... are you dying?
- No.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.126
- No, son. I'm... I'm not.
- Look, I'm not a little kid.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.087
I... I know.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.298
Come over here, man. Come on.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.065
- Remember my favorite playoffs?

23:20.232 --> 23:23.235
Lakers down 16
at the end of the third, right?

23:24.152 --> 23:27.989
Kobe, Shaq, Phil.
The whole legacy is in balance.

23:27.989 --> 23:31.159
And what happened? Come on, what happened?

23:33.203 --> 23:34.996
- They went off.
- Mm-hmm.

23:35.872 --> 23:40.085
Mamba lobbed it up to Shaq Diesel,
like, bam!

23:40.293 --> 23:42.879
- You know, they came back and won.

23:42.879 --> 23:46.591
Yeah, well, that's me. I'mma come back,
and I'mma win this thing.

23:47.717 --> 23:51.179
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.272
Yo, Pops.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.442
Hey. Uh-uh.
There are rules in this house,

24:04.067 --> 24:07.279
- and one is you do not sneak out.
- I wasn't even gone long.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.240
Okay. I don't care.
Your mom and I need to know where you are.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.744
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- Don't break our trust. Both of you.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.705
What did I do?

24:17.831 --> 24:21.293
Something happens to one of you,
the other one feels the repercussion.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.170
And that's forever, you understand?

24:25.088 --> 24:27.048
Now, I'm not gonna tell your mom.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.802
But you better get your act together fast.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.723
All right.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.604
Hey...

24:42.105 --> 24:44.107
- So was it worth it?

24:45.609 --> 24:46.735
Yeah, man.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.113
It was magical.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.429
- What in the...?

25:16.014 --> 25:18.975
What are you doing with a voodoo doll?
Give me that.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.650
Look, I need a little bit of magic,
okay, Mom? I gotta break this curse.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.362
Look, we're losing.

25:30.779 --> 25:34.824
And my career, my future,
my dreams are in flux.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.952
What if we don't get into Beacon?

25:37.160 --> 25:38.703
And what player do you know
that's five-seven?

25:39.079 --> 25:40.121
Dad is six-one.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.541
We need a miracle.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.336
I hear you, but this is not something
you play with.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.756
- Why?
- Because voodoo isn't just magic.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.344
- It's a religion. We need to honor that.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.347
Look, when your ancestors were stolen
from their homes in Africa

25:57.347 --> 26:00.559
and brought to America,
they carried with them their traditions

26:00.767 --> 26:03.478
to fight even when victories
were few and far between.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.856
- You can still win, son.
- I gotta win...

26:08.942 --> 26:10.026
for Dad.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.114
Let's go.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.618
Come on, man. Remember the play.

26:19.619 --> 26:22.414
Oh, I hope it's a good game today.
We really need this win.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.792
Come on, boys. You got this!

26:25.792 --> 26:27.627
All right, kids.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

26:27.627 --> 26:28.920
- All right.

26:30.463 --> 26:32.382
<i>At halftime, the Tigers at 27.</i>

26:32.507 --> 26:34.718
<i>Your Langston Hughes Lions, 20.</i>

26:35.802 --> 26:38.722
<i>Everybody give a big hand
to the Lion pep squad.</i>

26:45.478 --> 26:47.105
I know you're carrying a lot.

26:49.274 --> 26:53.445
My office is always open.
And my home is always open.

26:55.238 --> 26:58.283
No judgement. Just me and you.

27:01.745 --> 27:02.746
Thanks.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.956
You always know.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.342
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

27:17.344 --> 27:21.056
But they used to be so close
when they were little. What happened?

27:22.015 --> 27:25.435
- Well, Zuma got big, Filthy didn't.
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.852 --> 27:29.230
But they're the same dudes.
They're more alike than they know.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.818
Someone just needs to remind them.

27:42.702 --> 27:44.871
Timeout. Timeout.

27:53.963 --> 27:57.217
All right, first, um, I'm proud of you.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.969
You...  ...uh, you fought through

28:00.637 --> 28:03.014
and like I always told you,
it's not about that score.

28:03.598 --> 28:08.561
The question is, did we execute?
Yes, right? We executed.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.355
You was good on your matchups.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.149
<i>I gotta win...</i>

28:14.818 --> 28:15.819
<i>for dad.</i>

28:16.486 --> 28:20.740
<i>Your dad loves you.
We both do, win or lose.</i>

28:21.908 --> 28:25.662
And look, if you wanna break a curse,
start believing in yourself.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.331
Wholly and solely.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.376
It's in you.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.216
It's like I always say,
it's not what's on that score...

28:38.216 --> 28:39.426
Hold on, Coach.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.054
Y'all acting like we lost already.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.932
And Big V...
...what's going on with your face?

28:47.100 --> 28:48.309
Look, why we playin'?

28:48.309 --> 28:49.894
- 'Cause there's a game.
No.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.648
Because there's a game that we love.
It's in us.

28:53.857 --> 28:57.485
There's no shame in losing
because it makes us tougher, but we fight.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.531
And we keep fighting, through strife,
through struggle.

29:01.906 --> 29:06.286
But we gotta have faith in ourselves.
Our strength is our belief in us.

29:06.870 --> 29:07.871
In all of us.

29:07.871 --> 29:11.374
You heard him? It's in us, y'all,
all right? What we gonna do, Filthy?

29:11.624 --> 29:13.710
- We're gonna win this game.
- I know that's right.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.503
We should still pray though, right?

29:16.546 --> 29:18.006
- Oh, yeah, no doubt.
Mm.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.244
<i>We were always a net tied together.</i>

29:49.621 --> 29:51.247
<i>And when we believed in each other...</i>

29:52.624 --> 29:53.958
<i>it was like magic.</i>

30:10.975 --> 30:11.976
Go!

30:16.898 --> 30:18.066
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.740
Whoo!

30:28.910 --> 30:30.411
Let's go, all the way!

30:31.746 --> 30:34.666
Stay in the game. Stay in the game.
Stay on your man. Keep 'em up.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.643
Hell yeah! Yeah!

31:04.070 --> 31:05.321
<i>The ball was our wand.</i>

31:05.321 --> 31:07.740
<i>All we had to do
was wave it and have faith</i>

31:07.740 --> 31:10.159
<i>that all the work we put in would pay off.</i>

31:10.910 --> 31:13.454
<i>But there's also this thing called "luck."</i>

31:13.454 --> 31:15.164
<i>And now it's time, folks,</i>

31:15.331 --> 31:17.542
<i>the moment we've all been waiting for.
Selection is in.</i>

31:17.667 --> 31:21.629
<i>With the first pick in the 2030 NBA Draft,
the Los Angeles Lakers...</i>

31:26.050 --> 31:27.218
Yeah!
