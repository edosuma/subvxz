Bandits marked. Reference south.

01:00.454 --> 01:04.754
Black Sheep 2, angels 15. Alpha Check.

01:06.135 --> 01:10.476
Affirm. Estimated mark 4 miles.

Everybody out of burners.

Mark clear.

01:20.043 --> 01:22.965
Permission to splash target.

Break break, Black Sheep 44- 1,
This is Turkish AWACS Güney.

This is Turkish AWACS Güney.

01:36.122 --> 01:39.212
NATO friendlies in sector.

01:53.500 --> 02:01.517
THE MOUNTAIN II

02:51.209 --> 02:54.967
As a part of the kuffar
coalition...

02:59.953 --> 03:03.710
...having interviewed civilians...

03:06.960 --> 03:10.883
...and filmed idolaters...

03:11.397 --> 03:13.650
...I

03:17.670 --> 03:20.717
I regret...

03:23.546 --> 03:24.584
I regret Nothing!

03:24.585 --> 03:26.520
I REGRET NOTHING!

03:26.521 --> 03:29.567
The world must know these animals- -

03:34.803 --> 03:36.904
Keep filming.

03:36.905 --> 03:37.779
Do it!

03:37.780 --> 03:39.056
Do it you scum! Do it!

03:39.057 --> 03:42.563
Think I'll give you my fear?
Do it!

04:04.988 --> 04:06.574
The wind...

04:06.575 --> 04:09.746
...is intensity 2, from 3 o’clock.

04:09.831 --> 04:11.830
Distance 800 meters.

04:11.831 --> 04:16.039
A taut bow is pulled...

04:16.040 --> 04:19.253
To unleash the arrow.

05:31.923 --> 05:34.016
Ms. Balaban?

05:34.017 --> 05:36.812
Ms. Balaban, are you alright?

05:39.819 --> 05:42.704
Are you hurt anywhere?

05:42.705 --> 05:45.787
- What?
- Are you hurt?

05:45.788 --> 05:47.750
No.

05:51.449 --> 05:53.822
Please come with us.
We’re here for you.

05:53.823 --> 05:59.447
Sir, we need to head to the village.
We're too exposed.

05:59.448 --> 06:01.129
Mustafa, give me time.

06:01.130 --> 06:03.016
Five minutes tops, sir.

06:03.017 --> 06:07.651
Eşref, buy us time.
Drop anyone armed in the alleys.

06:07.652 --> 06:09.310
Earman in the alleys.

06:09.311 --> 06:11.653
- Who are you?
- Special Forces, ma’am.

06:11.654 --> 06:13.251
Combat search and rescue.

06:13.252 --> 06:16.021
Oğuz, Bekir.
Find Ceyda's civilian outfit.

06:16.022 --> 06:19.779
Baybars, gather mags.
We’re leaving.

06:20.257 --> 06:21.761
Where?

06:21.762 --> 06:24.977
Home, Ms. Balaban.
We’re going home.

06:52.587 --> 06:55.759
Here we go again, into the shit- -

06:57.610 --> 06:59.406
Join me only if you want it.

06:59.407 --> 07:02.288
I’ll never be accepted.

07:02.289 --> 07:05.045
My leg aches even when jacking off.

07:05.046 --> 07:07.506
Do you want it or not?

07:07.654 --> 07:09.990
Jacking off?

07:10.076 --> 07:11.662
Bekir...

07:11.663 --> 07:15.170
C’mon drink. Less
talk more sips.

07:17.928 --> 07:19.807
Whatever happened to that girl?

07:19.808 --> 07:23.900
You know, the one you told me about
at the relay station?

07:23.901 --> 07:26.657
Oh man, still remember that...

07:26.658 --> 07:29.537
She got married two months ago.

07:46.498 --> 07:49.922
We never had a girl whose voice
rang like toasted glass.

07:49.923 --> 07:51.134
You’re drunk again.

07:51.135 --> 07:54.099
You know what? We never really
forget someone.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.357
We carry lost ones behind our backs like
sacks of memories.

07:57.358 --> 08:00.114
We’re like porters, man.

08:00.115 --> 08:03.038
We pray, we cuss, we endure.

08:03.039 --> 08:05.710
But those memories prowl in
our heads like foxes.

08:05.711 --> 08:09.218
The dead and lost loves are the same.

08:09.219 --> 08:12.143
We only reminisce about them.

08:12.144 --> 08:15.903
Sometimes I see Captain
Yaşar in my dreams,

08:15.904 --> 08:18.740
His final glance at me.

08:21.166 --> 08:24.170
Worry in his eyes.

08:24.382 --> 08:27.513
Not for himself, you know?

08:28.100 --> 08:31.481
But afraid for me instead.

08:32.217 --> 08:34.056
What would he have said ?

08:34.057 --> 08:36.980
If he knew we were signing up for
Special Forces trials...

08:36.981 --> 08:40.126
...first he would lovingly
pat our backs.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.159
Then he’d tell a dirty joke.

08:42.159 --> 08:45.593
After that he would probably
cuss us out.

08:45.594 --> 08:47.722
Probably.

08:49.144 --> 08:51.146
Oğuz.

08:51.186 --> 08:55.487
We’re alive cos of Sergeant Kemal
and him. We need to be worthy.

08:55.488 --> 08:58.492
Otherwise we’re trash.

09:02.464 --> 09:05.218
To the unforgotten.

09:13.338 --> 09:16.007
Arif, what do you see?

09:16.008 --> 09:17.658
Iraq, sir...

09:17.659 --> 09:23.105
The land of betrayal and enmity.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.714
We’re 24 km southeast of the mountain.

09:33.715 --> 09:35.892
They will be here soon.

09:35.893 --> 09:37.508
Ammo status?

09:37.509 --> 09:42.991
We gathered what we could but they
are all AK rounds sir.

09:42.992 --> 09:49.301
These men were reinforcements.
Real assault troops are south.

09:53.095 --> 09:56.165
We need to reach the
landing zone quickly.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.517
- Bekir?
- Yes, sir.

09:57.518 --> 09:59.709
Get an AK, we can booby trap it.

09:59.710 --> 10:04.704
Why just me?

10:04.705 --> 10:08.436
Why?

10:08.437 --> 10:13.239
My team was also there.
Why just me?

10:13.240 --> 10:16.003
My cameraman Phillip,
producer Nechirwan could...

10:16.004 --> 10:19.481
...have been here with us, alive.

10:19.551 --> 10:22.246
Because they weren’t Turks...

10:22.247 --> 10:25.919
that’s why you did nothing.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.913
It is not that simple Ms. Balaban.

10:29.914 --> 10:32.719
Ceyda will do. No need for Ms.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.281
Don’t worry, I won’t keep reminding
you of your racist preferences.

10:36.282 --> 10:38.664
Remind us if you like.

10:38.665 --> 10:41.899
I can’t endanger the lives of my men
for those who aren’t Turkish citizens.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.706
-  Do you know who I am- -
-  Oh we do.

10:43.707 --> 10:46.754
Your views, your articles, your
opposition, they don’t concern us.

10:46.755 --> 10:47.934
A mission is a mission. Bekir?
- Yes sir.

10:47.935 --> 10:50.068
-  Bekir?
-  Yes sir.

10:50.069 --> 10:51.453
Scout ahead with Oğuz.

10:51.454 --> 10:53.322
We leave from the rear with Ceyda.

10:53.323 --> 10:55.524
We head for the villages
10 km west.

10:55.525 --> 10:56.817
Keep your eyes peeled.

10:56.818 --> 10:59.704
Ceyda wears my helmet and the kevlar
vest Eşref brought.

10:59.705 --> 11:02.125
If she takes it off, make her wear it.

11:02.126 --> 11:07.125
Are we all set?

11:57.321 --> 11:59.324
How is your ear?

11:59.325 --> 12:05.228
I have reconstruction surgery
in two weeks sir.

12:05.538 --> 12:08.953
Are you two kidding me?

12:08.954 --> 12:11.929
Just get your honorable discharge.
Why are you still in service?

12:11.930 --> 12:14.733
One of you has a platinum shoulder.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.267
The other one half lame.
What trials, what training?

12:18.268 --> 12:20.956
Sir, if you only let us explain
the situation...

12:20.957 --> 12:22.921
I don’t think you understand.

12:22.922 --> 12:27.227
We have no use for damaged men
who might risk their teams.

12:27.228 --> 12:29.871
Say we accept you, what do we
do with your friend?

12:29.872 --> 12:32.670
Cook behind enemy lines?

12:32.671 --> 12:34.475
Shit.

12:34.476 --> 12:35.808
What did you say?

12:35.809 --> 12:38.844
-  Selim.
-  Attention!

12:38.845 --> 12:45.074
-  I will take it from here.
-  Yes sir.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.932
At ease.

12:58.933 --> 13:01.708
Units are not about individualism.

13:01.709 --> 13:04.646
But about cohesiveness.

13:04.647 --> 13:07.662
If one man falters,
the entire team may fall.

13:07.663 --> 13:12.164
That is why old wounds are important.

13:12.526 --> 13:17.257
‘The short- termer has no rifle,
and the other is Bekir.’

13:17.258 --> 13:21.391
Yaşar's last words to me.

13:23.966 --> 13:27.800
- Are your two years up?
- They will be in two months sir.

13:27.801 --> 13:33.383
Bekir becomes a specialist,
myself a Lieutenant.

13:33.384 --> 13:36.379
Yaşar was my classmate.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.823
My friend.

13:38.824 --> 13:42.484
If they had send us to you
instead of HQ...

13:42.485 --> 13:46.706
...I would gladly have died to
avenge him.

13:46.707 --> 13:54.414
I won't throw kids he
saved into the flames.

13:54.518 --> 13:57.607
My answer is no.

14:00.189 --> 14:02.388
They are not kids anymore sir.

14:02.389 --> 14:05.184
Bekir wakes up gasping in the night...

14:05.185 --> 14:09.371
...to nightmares of Sergeant Kemal
whispering his wife’s name as he dies.

14:09.372 --> 14:10.677
Leyla.

14:10.678 --> 14:13.626
The other wants to dedicate himself
to a cause for the first time.

14:13.627 --> 14:18.323
They might be many things sir,
but they are not kids.

14:18.324 --> 14:22.659
If they died to make us live...

14:22.660 --> 14:25.121
...then let us live, sir.

14:25.122 --> 14:29.087
Let us make others live.

14:29.088 --> 14:32.079
You have two months.
Prepare well.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.965
The trials and classes will be hell.

14:37.607 --> 14:40.821
Yes!

14:47.751 --> 14:50.086
There aren’t real deserts you know.

14:50.087 --> 14:52.086
They are all wind erosion.

14:52.087 --> 14:54.738
Huh? Eurovision?

14:54.739 --> 14:57.401
Man, use the internet once for
something other than porn.

14:57.402 --> 14:59.548
Kidding, just kidding.

14:59.549 --> 15:01.936
Here we are, alone again.

15:01.937 --> 15:04.542
This is my fucking destiny.
My fate.

15:04.543 --> 15:08.847
Snow, winter, desert, sand...
Death and Oğuz.

15:08.848 --> 15:11.078
Dare you to nag when
Lt. Colonel's around.

15:11.079 --> 15:12.669
Oh I’m sorry, ‘sir’.

15:12.670 --> 15:17.542
I meant, I don’t pull
rank because it’s you.

15:17.543 --> 15:22.097
Tell me, do you think it was worth
risking 7 national treasures for Ceyda?

15:22.098 --> 15:24.730
Bekir Özbey, national treasure.

15:24.731 --> 15:28.851
Answer me you dolt.

15:28.852 --> 15:31.442
I don’t know.

15:31.443 --> 15:37.050
Well if you ask me she can
be a little more respectful.

15:37.051 --> 15:40.454
Bekir...

15:40.455 --> 15:43.338
662 Tamu Cizre, this is Storm Bringer.

15:43.339 --> 15:44.991
Package is safe, over.
- T- 155’s are ready sir.

15:44.992 --> 15:48.333
We can illuminate the area, over.

15:48.334 --> 15:50.674
Still undetected, no needs, over.

15:50.675 --> 15:54.110
Copy that Storm Bringer, on standby.

15:54.111 --> 15:57.172
Where are you from, Ms. Balaban?

15:57.173 --> 15:59.832
Is this you tactic?

15:59.833 --> 16:01.958
Excuse me?

16:01.959 --> 16:04.833
The others are robots.
I’m a package.

16:04.834 --> 16:08.445
Are you supposed to be the kind one?

16:08.446 --> 16:15.353
I wish the soldiers I train
would hear of what you just said.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.702
I believe this belongs to you.

16:19.703 --> 16:25.293
Other than us, you can
photograph anything you like.

16:25.294 --> 16:27.746
You don’t have to be nice.

16:27.747 --> 16:30.725
And you don’t have to be grateful.

16:30.726 --> 16:32.786
I’m not.

16:32.787 --> 16:35.333
I know.

16:45.465 --> 16:49.472
I’m from Milas.

17:21.377 --> 17:24.619
They executed everyone, even children.

17:24.621 --> 17:27.041
Sons of whores.

17:41.758 --> 17:43.223
Where are we?

17:43.224 --> 17:46.418
36- 25 to 41- 75.

17:46.419 --> 17:49.925
These are Yezidi grasslands.

17:58.523 --> 18:02.261
This is recent sir.
Maybe 2- 3 hours.

18:02.262 --> 18:06.377
They don’t struggle during killings.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.953
Fathers lie to their children so
that it’s over quickly.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.494
Otherwise they torture those who
resist. Pull nails... gouge eyes...

18:10.495 --> 18:12.811
Their only fault is to exist.

18:12.812 --> 18:15.735
To their killers,

18:15.736 --> 18:18.635
 Yezidi are not human, but devilspawn.

18:18.636 --> 18:23.955
Their sin is to have a religion
the others can’t understand.

18:23.956 --> 18:27.002
This is not our fight.

18:28.681 --> 18:31.339
No sir. It’s not.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.201
Because this is no fight at all.

18:35.202 --> 18:37.236
- Sir?
- Go ahead Arif.

18:37.237 --> 18:39.365
They’re coming.

18:49.564 --> 18:52.930
Let them come.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.639
We are death’s lovers.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.077
Take off your berets.

18:58.078 --> 19:01.341
Take a look at them.

19:01.342 --> 19:05.528
Are you here for those berets?

19:05.529 --> 19:08.786
From the 200 selected NCO and
officers in these trials...

19:08.787 --> 19:13.417
...only 20 will join active duty.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.279
But why?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.420
What is our nature?

19:17.421 --> 19:20.308
Are we heroes? Warriors?

19:20.309 --> 19:22.690
Legends?

19:22.691 --> 19:25.895
If you’re seeking such things, you’re
in the wrong place gentlemen.

19:25.896 --> 19:29.356
We are nothing.
Our aim is to be forgotten...

19:29.357 --> 19:31.262
...unknown.

19:31.263 --> 19:33.852
Our names won’t be carved into stone.

19:33.853 --> 19:36.579
They won’t sing about us.

19:36.580 --> 19:41.766
For if we gather fame, that means
we have failed.

19:41.767 --> 19:45.386
Our nature is to utterly serve
the Turkish people.

19:45.387 --> 19:47.527
We are death’s lovers...

19:47.528 --> 19:49.433
...and only us...

19:49.434 --> 19:52.498
...because both suffering and fear
of her must stay away from our people.

19:52.499 --> 19:57.757
If one day when you let out
your last breath...

19:57.758 --> 20:00.133
...the only thing you see is your
blood...

20:00.134 --> 20:02.024
...and the only thing you hear is
silence...

20:02.025 --> 20:03.781
...know that you are not alone.

20:03.782 --> 20:08.347
Those before you, those after you,
all of Special Forces...

20:08.348 --> 20:10.694
...will die with you...

20:10.695 --> 20:13.590
...and be reborn with you.

20:13.591 --> 20:18.617
-  One dies...
-  ...a thousand rise!

20:42.560 --> 20:45.522
-  Good luck, gentlemen.
-  Sir yes sir!

21:12.344 --> 21:16.311
Oğuz, they’re coming. Oğuz!

21:16.312 --> 21:18.859
Bekir...

21:18.859 --> 21:21.989
Oğuz?

21:27.637 --> 21:30.518
Oh they’re here man. Oğuz?

21:30.519 --> 21:33.610
Shut up, stop using the comm.
You’re gonna get us killed!

21:33.611 --> 21:37.327
Hush damn it!

21:38.157 --> 21:41.068
- Tamu Cizre.
- Your orders, sir.

21:41.069 --> 21:44.033
Illuminate them.

21:55.833 --> 21:59.052
Copy Storm Bringer. Illuminating.

22:16.249 --> 22:19.074
Arif.

22:19.075 --> 22:22.080
The night births the moon.

22:23.631 --> 22:26.301
To rise and fall.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.943
Mecnun moans as his blood...

22:39.784 --> 22:42.746
...joins beloved Leyla.

23:05.937 --> 23:07.932
These men came from the west, Mustafa.

23:07.933 --> 23:14.250
There were none west this morning.

23:14.251 --> 23:16.066
662 Tamu Cizre.
This is Storm Bringer.

23:16.067 --> 23:19.455
What do you see?

23:19.456 --> 23:23.519
Veysel, it’s me, Doğan.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.050
Your orders, sir.

23:25.051 --> 23:28.506
Kurds are exhausted north. They
can’t hold. The pincer has closed.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.247
How many?

23:30.248 --> 23:32.843
The jihadis are encircling the
mountain to shut off the border.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.650
You need to hurry.

23:35.651 --> 23:38.043
Sir, how many?

23:38.044 --> 23:39.422
Two thousand.

23:39.423 --> 23:41.114
Get out of there.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.576
What does this mean?

23:43.577 --> 23:45.347
This area is surrounded.

23:45.348 --> 23:49.303
Such bad luck. We’re in the middle
of total invasion.

23:49.304 --> 23:51.128
Sir.

23:51.129 --> 23:54.594
This truck works.
We can reach the climb to the mountain.

23:54.595 --> 23:56.465
Won’t Turkey send you reinforcements?

23:56.466 --> 23:58.551
It's not sanctioned.

23:58.552 --> 24:02.726
We're on our own.

24:02.727 --> 24:06.649
The situation is deteriorating.

24:06.650 --> 24:10.833
Those two thousand men,
in order to hide from American bombers...

24:10.834 --> 24:17.434
...will climb the mountain.
We need to find safe shelter.

24:17.435 --> 24:20.908
Commander...

24:20.909 --> 24:25.032
There is a place...

24:25.033 --> 24:28.163
There is a place, gentlemen!

24:28.164 --> 24:31.183
A dark place.

24:31.184 --> 24:36.847
A place that will lend you
strength, even if you have none.

24:36.848 --> 24:39.802
You’ve finished the obstacle track.

24:39.803 --> 24:43.183
You think you’re done for, but no.

24:43.184 --> 24:49.971
Now, together,
we discover that place.

24:49.972 --> 24:53.041
You!

24:53.042 --> 24:55.706
Bekir Özbey, Ankara. Your orders, sir!

24:55.707 --> 24:58.441
-  You’re a wounded vet.
-  Right leg, sir.

24:58.442 --> 25:00.069
I don’t care.

25:00.070 --> 25:02.380
You ran the track, does it hurt?

25:02.381 --> 25:03.578
Yes, sir.

25:03.579 --> 25:05.189
I don’t care.

25:05.190 --> 25:07.711
Can you limp?

25:07.712 --> 25:09.403
A little sir.

25:09.404 --> 25:13.241
I don’t care! Run!

25:13.242 --> 25:15.158
Run Bekir, run! Go!

25:15.159 --> 25:20.502
Sir, yes sir!

25:20.503 --> 25:22.977
That pain will be honey
during missions, Bekir!

25:22.978 --> 25:24.813
Your eyes will tear up!

25:24.814 --> 25:27.001
Your teeth will ache!

25:27.002 --> 25:33.910
But I’ll make you find that dark place!

25:33.911 --> 25:36.586
The mind is formed of gears, gentlemen.

25:36.587 --> 25:38.825
It unifies the body.

25:38.826 --> 25:41.329
The mind has nothing to lose...

25:41.330 --> 25:42.758
Motivate the body.

25:42.759 --> 25:45.728
Here’s something to push you, Bekir!

25:45.729 --> 25:49.040
I’ll eliminate you!

25:49.041 --> 25:52.497
Lungs, spleen giving up!

25:52.498 --> 25:58.347
Platinum screws, whole body bankrupt!

25:58.348 --> 26:02.459
But you can’t go to that
dark place only for yourself.

26:02.460 --> 26:06.952
Bekir Özbey, back here
in 30 seconds...

26:06.953 --> 26:11.523
Or I'll eliminate your friend Oğuz too.

26:11.524 --> 26:16.766
He’ll make it!

26:16.767 --> 26:18.431
Your creed!

26:18.432 --> 26:19.807
Race!

26:19.808 --> 26:20.980
Music you listen to!

26:20.981 --> 26:22.070
Favourite food!

26:22.071 --> 26:24.090
...don’t matter!

26:24.091 --> 26:27.068
Only two important things, gentlemen!

26:27.069 --> 26:30.007
Homeland... and the guy next to you!

26:30.008 --> 26:34.162
You die and kill for these
two things.

26:34.163 --> 26:38.168
If need be, your friend will cripple
his leg once again...

26:38.169 --> 26:43.581
...but he will never
let his friend down!

27:04.022 --> 27:07.824
Your wound will be a privilege, Bekir.

27:07.825 --> 27:11.604
Every day you’ll get
electro- physical therapy.

27:11.605 --> 27:13.960
You will weep from pain, understood?

27:13.961 --> 27:16.105
Yes, sir.

27:16.106 --> 27:20.473
You think it’s over rookies?

27:20.474 --> 27:26.096
On your feet!

27:26.097 --> 27:28.978
Into the lake up to your chest.

27:28.979 --> 27:31.901
Sponges will not touch the water.

27:31.902 --> 27:34.782
We are here until dawn, guys!

27:34.879 --> 27:36.913
Your body temperature will fall.

27:36.914 --> 27:40.040
When the shivering starts
and suddenly stops...

27:40.041 --> 27:42.982
...know that you are freezing.

27:42.983 --> 27:48.227
Don’t get wasted, get out and
be eliminated.

27:48.228 --> 27:51.176
Gentlemen, we will check every
sponge in the morning.

27:51.177 --> 27:55.220
One drop of water when squeezed,
and you’ll still be eliminated.

27:55.221 --> 27:59.297
I’m not really a tea guy. But I’d take
Turkish coffee though.

27:59.298 --> 28:02.930
- Wow sir, no tea for us?
- Come here and have some Oğuz.

28:02.931 --> 28:06.388
Sir if you wouldn’t mind, you can
bring it here. The water is beautiful.

28:06.389 --> 28:10.334
Come here sir, we’ll warm you up.

28:10.335 --> 28:12.322
Looks like you want to run again Bekir.

28:12.323 --> 28:15.311
No sir, I just want to
warm up.

28:15.312 --> 28:18.734
Love of the homeland will warm you, Bekir!

28:21.671 --> 28:24.658
You are thunderbolts, rookies!

28:24.659 --> 28:26.782
You are avalanches!

28:26.783 --> 28:29.220
Whirlpools!

28:29.221 --> 28:32.203
The bottom of the sea...

28:32.204 --> 28:34.493
...depths of the earth...

28:34.494 --> 28:36.787
...even the highest place in the skies...

28:36.788 --> 28:39.482
...is your home!

28:39.483 --> 28:40.945
You will be afraid!

28:40.946 --> 28:42.998
Fear is good.

28:42.999 --> 28:48.394
Fear will keep you alive.

28:48.453 --> 28:51.298
But not fear of heights...

28:51.299 --> 28:54.494
...because eagles
don’t fear heights!

28:54.495 --> 29:03.605
How the wicked bullet
pierced his brow

29:03.606 --> 29:12.564
His black eyes suddenly frozen

29:12.565 --> 29:21.809
Only her son’s bloody beret in
her hands

29:21.810 --> 29:31.138
Oh mother, I would lie if
I said he will come back

29:31.139 --> 29:39.224
Beautiful mother, dear mother,
it’s not easy

29:39.225 --> 29:48.911
It’s not easy

29:48.912 --> 29:57.025
Never easy

29:57.026 --> 30:06.647
It’s not easy

30:06.648 --> 30:38.547
Never easy

30:40.417 --> 30:42.101
What is this place, exactly?

30:42.102 --> 30:45.472
Tomb of Sargon. An Akkadian king.

30:45.473 --> 30:46.897
Take Baybars and Eşref.

30:46.898 --> 30:50.052
You have command.
We need to shelter there.

30:50.053 --> 30:51.930
Yes sir.

30:53.840 --> 30:58.140
Baybars.

31:01.329 --> 31:05.866
Everybody finish their meals.
We join them in ten minutes.

31:05.867 --> 31:08.159
Why did they want you to rescue me?

31:08.160 --> 31:09.076
Does it matter?

31:09.077 --> 31:12.356
Throughout my career I’ve written
articles opposing you.

31:12.357 --> 31:15.451
Good fucking job.

31:15.452 --> 31:17.638
Bekir.

31:18.801 --> 31:20.896
Forgive him.

31:20.897 --> 31:24.615
Special Forces took him out of the
fight, but not the fight out of him.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.127
It’s alright.

31:26.128 --> 31:28.304
I appreciate speaking your mind.

31:28.305 --> 31:30.779
Our thought, is our mission.

31:30.780 --> 31:32.993
And that is to get Ceyda
Balaban, out of Iraq.

31:32.994 --> 31:34.684
-  That’s all?
-  It is.

31:34.685 --> 31:37.530
So Turkey will idly watch
this barbarity.

31:37.531 --> 31:40.625
Those who suffer here were once
a part of us.

31:40.626 --> 31:44.867
If we warred for all our parts, we’d need
to drive tanks to Altai Mountains.

31:44.868 --> 31:49.710
This is not a war,
it’s a crime against humanity.

31:53.866 --> 31:57.750
Am I supposed to shut up and remain
silently grateful because you saved me?

31:57.751 --> 31:59.496
Nobody wants you grateful.

31:59.497 --> 32:03.125
But you should respect those who
volunteered into this shit, for you.

32:03.126 --> 32:04.206
You’re right.

32:04.207 --> 32:07.489
Respect for you and for the institution
you serve are two different things.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.206
Give me a break.

32:09.207 --> 32:13.620
Tell that to the sheep who lock up
soldiers and then declare them heroes.

32:13.621 --> 32:16.680
Blood and life.

32:16.681 --> 32:18.331
That’s what we offer here.

32:18.332 --> 32:22.064
Bekir, enough.

32:22.104 --> 32:25.225
Bombardment will soon begin, pack up.

35:11.737 --> 35:13.461
Eşref!

35:13.462 --> 35:16.301
He can take care of himself, go!

35:26.099 --> 35:29.040
C4. Basic Semtex 1A.

35:29.041 --> 35:31.002
Find the fuse.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.332
Found.

36:01.333 --> 36:04.658
- No backup trigger.
- Same here.

36:04.659 --> 36:07.495
We ready?

36:09.359 --> 36:14.146
Stop it! Stop it!

36:15.280 --> 36:17.717
Stop it!

36:17.718 --> 36:20.718
Son of a ...!

36:28.598 --> 36:31.602
FG 1, this is FG 2.

36:31.638 --> 36:34.970
The tomb is clear, waiting for you.

37:01.506 --> 37:03.955
Not interested.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.486
What?

37:05.487 --> 37:06.841
Not interested in what?

37:06.842 --> 37:11.774
In what you’re doing. I don’t care.
I’m here to buy books.

37:11.775 --> 37:13.867
Since you are you prepared to
be this defensive...

37:13.868 --> 37:17.309
Am I under attack? Never mind,
don’t answer that, no need.

37:17.310 --> 37:20.099
I'm really not interested.

37:20.100 --> 37:23.433
Do all guys who approach you
give up this easily?

37:23.434 --> 37:27.163
Unless they're shameless, sure.

37:28.161 --> 37:29.948
I have this theory.

37:29.949 --> 37:32.566
In essence, all men are actually
invaders.

37:32.567 --> 37:35.116
Women on the other hand, are castles.

37:35.117 --> 37:37.871
One aims to conquer and occupy,
proving himself.

37:37.872 --> 37:42.533
The other wants to remain secure
and repel the onslaught.

37:42.534 --> 37:44.074
True romantic.

37:44.075 --> 37:46.379
But then there are some invaders...

37:46.380 --> 37:49.663
...so interesting and
so original...

37:49.664 --> 37:52.464
...that the castle decides...

37:52.465 --> 37:54.911
...to open its gates without resistance.

37:54.912 --> 37:58.655
And you think you’re one of these
interesting invaders?

37:58.656 --> 38:01.258
You aren’t doing great, let me tell you.

38:01.259 --> 38:04.586
Want to grab coffee?

38:04.587 --> 38:07.230
I also have a theory.

38:07.231 --> 38:11.301
Ultimately you're looking
for a nanny. Not a lover.

38:11.302 --> 38:12.629
Possible.

38:12.630 --> 38:17.346
That’s not so enjoyable for
us women, though.

38:18.725 --> 38:21.533
Why specifically Special Forces?

38:21.534 --> 38:24.359
There was a feeling I had during combat.

38:24.360 --> 38:27.005
An awareness.

38:29.470 --> 38:32.783
A moment where the true
value of life just hit me.

38:32.784 --> 38:34.745
Turtle.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.632
- Turtle?
- I mean a turtle personality.

38:37.633 --> 38:39.389
Because I’m green?

38:39.390 --> 38:43.000
Think of a turtle.
Crossing the road.

38:43.001 --> 38:46.809
Disregarding the cars. It
thinks it's shell will protect it.

38:46.810 --> 38:49.260
But in reality, it’s fragile.
Can be crushed at any second.

38:49.261 --> 38:52.727
Turtle personalities don’t really
care about what happens to them.

38:52.728 --> 38:55.653
A wise woman would stay away
from such a damaged man.

38:55.654 --> 38:57.708
I should just get up and leave.

38:57.709 --> 39:00.067
Why don’t you?

39:00.068 --> 39:02.089
How long until your first mission?

39:02.090 --> 39:06.070
Assuming I pass the trials...

39:06.474 --> 39:09.570
...five more years.

39:09.571 --> 39:12.282
How long do you need me for?

39:18.028 --> 39:21.284
Check it.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.735
You said Akkadian...

39:28.736 --> 39:32.199
...but face is Alexander the Great.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.884
I guess I shouldn’t be surprised
you’re a history expert.

39:35.885 --> 39:39.155
Somewhere my college professor
is laughing.

39:39.156 --> 39:44.166
Load it.

39:44.389 --> 39:46.965
Sargon was a king who lived
4000 years ago.

39:46.966 --> 39:52.472
Successive civilizations built
on top of their ruins.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.715
Sumerians, Egyptians, Persians,
Babylonians, Greeks.

39:54.716 --> 39:56.933
All the way to our present day.

39:56.934 --> 40:00.980
Some built tombs,
some placed mosaics.

40:00.981 --> 40:04.404
Some drank kymyz.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.944
To you, all soldiers are noble.

40:07.945 --> 40:10.911
But you see, all of those
civilizations also had soldiers.

40:10.912 --> 40:13.957
In the end they fought, and killed
each other for more and more.

40:13.958 --> 40:17.859
They still do.

40:19.637 --> 40:24.761
Is that how you justify your
hate of the military?

40:24.762 --> 40:27.834
By placing blame of war on only soldiers?

40:27.835 --> 40:31.262
Again.

40:31.263 --> 40:36.345
We don’t think all soldiers are noble.

40:36.346 --> 40:42.945
Only those who serve their people.

40:42.946 --> 40:44.820
What good will learning this do for me?

40:44.821 --> 40:47.633
Hopefully nothing.

40:47.634 --> 40:49.804
Have you ever killed someone?

40:52.909 --> 40:55.580
How does it feel?

40:57.398 --> 41:00.863
It’s a stain.

41:03.820 --> 41:06.991
Get ready.

41:22.016 --> 41:25.952
Sir, I’ll carry you.

41:25.953 --> 41:28.916
I will sir! I’ll carry you!

41:31.510 --> 41:35.100
Oğuz, wake up! Oğuz!

41:38.751 --> 41:41.771
You’ll take my rifle.

41:41.772 --> 41:44.426
This is a dangerous place, Oğuz.

41:44.427 --> 41:50.333
When I’m about to fall asleep at night,
I always wake up and look around me.

41:50.334 --> 41:53.048
I’m human too.
I feel fear as well.

41:55.819 --> 41:58.613
One dies! A thousand rises!

42:09.707 --> 42:12.585
Oğuz?

42:14.685 --> 42:17.838
The water’s freezing. Are you alright?

42:17.839 --> 42:19.828
Don’t do this to yourself.
Get up.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.559
I’m okay here.

42:21.560 --> 42:26.117
This training will devastate you.

42:30.254 --> 42:34.525
You remember stuff you’re supposed
to forget and internalize it. Don’t.

42:44.648 --> 42:49.251
When they saved us...

42:49.252 --> 42:53.323
...they thought I did what I did
because of bravery.

42:53.324 --> 43:00.670
As if I were defiant before the
sniper who was shooting at us.

43:00.671 --> 43:03.745
That’s a lie.

43:03.746 --> 43:06.087
I was depleted.

43:06.088 --> 43:10.375
I lost.

43:10.376 --> 43:16.000
I just didn’t want to leave Bekir behind.

43:16.001 --> 43:19.634
Wanting death is a weird thing.

43:19.635 --> 43:22.765
Having it be your only escape.

43:24.522 --> 43:28.443
You kind of want to fall in the dark.

43:28.444 --> 43:33.481
The thought of it becomes sweet.

43:33.482 --> 43:38.561
I still couldn’t leave that mentality.

43:38.562 --> 43:41.136
What if I died there?

43:41.137 --> 43:43.818
What?

43:43.819 --> 43:45.484
Not physically.

43:45.485 --> 43:50.478
What if I can never regain my
enthusiasm or normality?

43:50.479 --> 43:56.523
That is why I must go back and
face that moment once again.

43:56.524 --> 44:03.138
That terror and awareness has become...

44:03.139 --> 44:07.710
...the only thing that makes me happy.

44:07.711 --> 44:09.966
The only thing that makes you happy?

44:09.967 --> 44:13.261
I know, it sounds strange.

44:13.262 --> 44:15.308
You’ll immediately talk about men,
women and relationships...

44:15.309 --> 44:18.303
...how you’re hurt at this.

44:18.304 --> 44:21.229
No, I won’t.

44:21.230 --> 44:24.938
You think you’re so smart.

44:24.939 --> 44:29.398
But being human
is not about ending fear.

44:29.399 --> 44:35.411
It’s about accepting them,
moving forward despite them.

44:35.412 --> 44:39.000
I fear stuff too.

44:39.674 --> 44:41.554
Like what?

44:41.555 --> 44:44.603
Like catching cold tomorrow.

44:55.764 --> 44:58.360
Up, up, up.

44:58.361 --> 45:02.598
-  What now?
-  Get up.

45:02.599 --> 45:07.373
Oh I’m sorry? I thought your only happiness
was awareness and terror?

45:07.374 --> 45:09.593
You’re something terrible too.

45:09.594 --> 45:12.792
No thanks, I’m going to find myself a
normal guy. You can keep flailing.

45:12.793 --> 45:17.947
- Nailing?
- I said flailing, idiot.

45:19.936 --> 45:22.437
662 Tamu Cizre.

45:22.438 --> 45:27.112
662 Tamu Cizre.

45:27.113 --> 45:31.495
662 Tamu Cizre.

45:31.496 --> 45:36.106
- Are we too high up?
- No, sir. Must be a jammer.

45:36.107 --> 45:38.763
Keep trying.

45:38.764 --> 45:41.269
662 Tamu Cizre.

45:41.270 --> 45:44.859
Visual, sir.

46:04.873 --> 46:08.442
Ceyda? What will they do to the women.

46:08.443 --> 46:12.875
What do you think they’ll do?

46:12.876 --> 46:15.656
They are on our way, sir.

46:15.657 --> 46:18.645
Don’t get emotional.

46:18.646 --> 46:22.401
If we ignore this too, I’m about
to lose all emotion anyways.

46:22.402 --> 46:27.273
We can also head for the other peak.

46:27.274 --> 46:29.640
What do we do, sir?

46:29.641 --> 46:31.356
How long have you been hungry?

46:31.357 --> 46:32.581
Seven days, sir.

46:32.582 --> 46:33.727
Thirst?

46:33.728 --> 46:36.260
Two days, sir.

46:36.261 --> 46:39.860
Man, you guys are fucked.

46:39.861 --> 46:41.997
How long have being awake, rookie?

46:41.998 --> 46:44.830
Three days, sir.

46:44.831 --> 46:48.163
Quit the trials.
This life isn’t for you.

46:48.164 --> 46:51.029
Gentlemen, I got a big table inside
for all of you.

46:51.030 --> 46:52.812
Brought some delicious food.

46:52.813 --> 46:56.489
Like what you ask?
Alexander Kebab.

46:56.490 --> 46:58.654
Marinated lamb kebab.

46:58.655 --> 47:01.043
Ayran, tea, coffee.

47:01.044 --> 47:04.007
Baklava. Both walnut and
pistachio baklava.

47:04.008 --> 47:07.750
And of course we have what?

47:07.751 --> 47:09.526
Water. Boys, we have water.

47:09.527 --> 47:11.918
I had huge ice cubes brought for you.

47:11.919 --> 47:17.915
When you drop them in, you will
hear them crackle, gentlemen.

47:17.916 --> 47:21.646
All you have to do, is to tell us...

47:21.647 --> 47:22.669
...the name on your piece of paper.

47:22.970 --> 47:26.684
Down!

47:50.314 --> 47:52.755
Yavuz.

47:52.756 --> 47:56.768
Go get some grub.

47:56.769 --> 48:01.923
Sir.

48:01.924 --> 48:06.426
I’ll cuss, sir.

48:06.427 --> 48:10.405
Oh no, sir, he’s going to cuss!
Maybe we should skip him?

48:10.406 --> 48:14.485
This is torture training, skippy.
Cuss, sing, makes no difference.

48:14.486 --> 48:19.045
Please sir, don’t have him sing.
That will be the real torture.

48:19.046 --> 48:21.970
Tell us the name on your piece
of paper, go eat hot food.

48:21.971 --> 48:25.709
Sleep like a log. Let this
suffering end, Bekir.

48:25.710 --> 48:28.965
This life is not for you.

48:43.625 --> 48:46.325
The enemy will not offer you food.

48:46.326 --> 48:49.558
They won’t give you warm
beds as you give up!

48:49.559 --> 48:52.337
They won’t help with the pain!

48:52.338 --> 48:56.793
Tell me.

48:56.794 --> 49:00.171
Tell me buddy.
Give me the name,

49:00.172 --> 49:06.450
-  Give me ...
-  Forgive me during nightime. As the moon crosses the sky

49:06.451 --> 49:12.895
Forgive me before dawn
Right when we break up

49:13.376 --> 49:19.958
For you, are the rain to my deserts

49:19.959 --> 49:26.270
You are the morning to my night

49:26.271 --> 49:32.084
You are the comrade to my life

49:32.085 --> 49:36.636
The blanket to my winter

49:54.592 --> 49:56.810
-  Sir, he’s approaching the record.
-  He'll pass it.

49:56.811 --> 49:59.940
35, 36.

50:06.494 --> 50:09.867
38, 39, 40.

50:09.868 --> 50:13.793
41, 42.

50:22.452 --> 50:24.496
These guys were forged in fire.

50:24.497 --> 50:25.813
They won’t give up easily.

50:25.814 --> 50:29.665
Captain, I 'm thirsty.
Give me some more?

51:09.903 --> 51:12.424
I am not Superman,
bullets do affect me.

51:12.425 --> 51:15.013
Baybars, what about you?

51:15.014 --> 51:17.601
Me too sir.

51:24.084 --> 51:30.934
I’m Superman sir. Got one in the leg,
then became a red beret.

51:30.935 --> 51:33.338
Why don't you open your
arms and run before us. Bekir.

51:33.339 --> 51:37.809
Cover for us.

51:37.810 --> 51:40.406
Sing Ankaran Turgut while you run.

51:40.407 --> 51:42.953
Oh man, how I miss his songs.

51:56.377 --> 51:57.744
Arif, your target?

51:57.745 --> 51:59.917
3 o’clock, sir.

51:59.918 --> 52:01.764
If it misses, the gasoline...

52:01.765 --> 52:04.147
Won’t miss.

52:04.148 --> 52:05.988
Get ready for contact.

52:05.989 --> 52:07.744
On three.

52:07.745 --> 52:09.574
One.

52:09.575 --> 52:12.328
On point with Bekir.

52:12.329 --> 52:16.513
Two.

52:16.514 --> 52:17.160
Three.

52:17.161 --> 52:20.911
Safety's off. First contact in the head.

52:23.697 --> 52:26.697
Wear your helmet!

53:14.488 --> 53:17.910
Sniper!

53:19.857 --> 53:22.443
Get down!

53:27.278 --> 53:30.502
Why does the poet toil,

53:38.194 --> 53:40.407
To weave the poem.

53:51.238 --> 53:52.358
Are you alright?

53:52.359 --> 53:54.654
Yes!

55:19.866 --> 55:22.454
Alright, it’s alright.

55:29.227 --> 55:31.993
Don’t be afraid.

55:31.994 --> 55:33.709
You’re safe.

55:33.710 --> 55:39.931
It’s over.

55:57.959 --> 56:01.210
May God give you blessings.

56:01.211 --> 56:09.113
May God repay your kindness
in abundance.

56:09.114 --> 56:10.596
Amen.

56:10.597 --> 56:12.901
Amen.

56:12.902 --> 56:14.960
Amen.

56:14.961 --> 56:18.630
Amen.

56:21.511 --> 56:22.762
Amen we say, oh Lord, as we open
our hands to your holy domain...

56:22.763 --> 56:30.520
...let us not be without your grace,
let our hearts know contentedness.

56:30.521 --> 56:31.526
Amen.

56:31.527 --> 56:35.562
We believe there is no limit
to you mercy.

56:35.563 --> 56:39.336
Your charity and will is infinite.

56:39.337 --> 56:42.062
- Bless us with those, oh Lord.
- Amen.

56:42.063 --> 56:43.815
You adore the good, those who repent.

56:43.931 --> 56:50.057
Let us be able to reach you
as we ourselves repent, Lord.

56:50.058 --> 56:51.086
Amen.

56:51.087 --> 56:54.510
Lighten the unbearable
loads on our souls...

56:55.238 --> 56:59.487
...do not let us be helpless, Lord.

56:59.488 --> 57:00.384
Amen.

57:00.385 --> 57:05.520
Give us, her friends, her brother Mete,
her father Veysel...

57:05.521 --> 57:09.365
...and mother Ayşe strength to bear
the pain, oh Lord.

57:09.366 --> 57:22.682
Defend our homeland, our people, our flag,
our sacred values oh God ...

57:22.683 --> 57:24.768
-  Amen!
- El Fatiha.

57:37.708 --> 57:40.128
My condolences, Veysel.

57:45.109 --> 57:47.546
Do you need anything at all?

57:47.547 --> 57:49.837
A leave perhaps?

57:49.838 --> 57:53.018
I thought I knew death, sir.

57:53.019 --> 57:56.526
Back in 94, General Osman and we
used to fly over dead bodies...

57:56.527 --> 58:00.325
...in UH helicopters...

58:00.495 --> 58:04.002
...we used to find out who died
where, with our noses.

58:04.003 --> 58:07.552
Back then America would refuse
giving night vision to our birds.

58:07.553 --> 58:11.020
We used to find our martyrs with nose.

58:11.021 --> 58:13.609
I thought I knew death.

58:13.610 --> 58:16.323
Now I know I didn’t.

58:16.952 --> 58:19.377
Turns out death...

58:19.378 --> 58:21.629
...is waiting for my wife
at the door of the funeral home...

58:21.630 --> 58:24.677
...as she washes my girl’s dead body.

58:24.678 --> 58:27.183
I waited.

58:27.184 --> 58:28.855
I cried.

58:28.856 --> 58:32.349
I cried for dresses she’d never wear.

58:32.364 --> 58:35.989
I cried for fights we’d never have.

58:37.710 --> 58:41.537
I cried for a life unlived.

58:42.555 --> 58:46.946
If only she could love a man,
get married...

58:47.777 --> 58:50.824
...have children.

58:50.825 --> 58:55.252
When I woke up from the daydream, I had
punched the mortuary wall 20 times.

58:55.253 --> 58:58.260
Blood, tears and water were everywhere.

58:58.261 --> 59:00.265
Had the undertaker bandage my hand.

59:00.266 --> 59:03.479
Three broken bones.

59:03.691 --> 59:05.401
No need for a leave.

59:05.402 --> 59:08.241
Have them send painkillers.

59:22.298 --> 59:25.555
We’ve eaten a third of our ammo.

59:29.484 --> 59:33.072
We need to reach the LZ fast, sir.

59:33.075 --> 59:37.502
We are surrounded. Tracks are
everywhere. Already engaged too.

59:37.503 --> 59:38.906
We’re pushing our luck.

59:38.907 --> 59:42.495
Do you know what they first teach you
when you get Search and Rescue command?

59:42.496 --> 59:44.749
Lying.

59:44.960 --> 59:47.173
That’s not what they literally say.

59:47.174 --> 59:50.181
But it’s the essence of it.

59:50.182 --> 59:53.021
If morale is low
nothing else matters.

59:53.022 --> 59:56.737
You can’t just tell the naked truth
to your men on days of casualties.

59:56.738 --> 59:58.658
You have to build a lie.

59:58.659 --> 01:00:01.081
Then you need to believe it yourself.

01:00:01.082 --> 01:00:03.252
What kind of a lie?

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.346
A beautiful one.

01:00:08.225 --> 01:00:11.983
That they’ll be remembered after death.

01:00:16.662 --> 01:00:19.355
Know how many men
died under my command?

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:22.479
I don’t know.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.523
23.

01:00:25.027 --> 01:00:29.202
I've always consoled myself that I would
always be reminded of those 23 men.

01:00:29.203 --> 01:00:32.914
But each passing day I forget
their faces a little more.

01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:04.121
Peshmerga. (Iraqi Kurdish security forces)

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:07.085
Pesheng.

01:01:07.547 --> 01:01:10.094
**Kurdish**
How’s your Turkish?

01:01:10.095 --> 01:01:13.739
**Kurdish**
Better than your Kurmanji (Kurdish dialect).

01:01:27.094 --> 01:01:29.960
You’re in bad shape.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.500
I will give you morphine.

01:01:36.952 --> 01:01:38.872
What’s your name?

01:01:38.873 --> 01:01:41.377
Çiya.

01:01:51.196 --> 01:01:54.285
We aren’t PKK (Kurdish
Worker's Party), Turk.

01:01:54.286 --> 01:01:56.708
We are Zerevani (Kurdish
militarised police force).

01:01:56.709 --> 01:01:58.630
Tell me Çiya, what happened?

01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:02.096
They sent us from Şeqlawe.

01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:05.020
Then DAESH (Islamic State of Iraq
and the Levant) invasion began.

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:06.983
We couldn’t slow them.

01:02:06.984 --> 01:02:09.197
How many were you?

01:02:09.198 --> 01:02:11.576
How many men were you, Çiya?

01:02:11.703 --> 01:02:14.081
80.

01:02:16.507 --> 01:02:18.968
Now, just 1.

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:21.936
Commander?

01:02:21.937 --> 01:02:24.400
Those boys were entrusted to me.

01:02:24.401 --> 01:02:26.656
Me.

01:02:26.657 --> 01:02:29.536
Now they’re food for this cursed mountain.

01:02:37.808 --> 01:02:40.271
Don’t waste them on me.

01:02:40.272 --> 01:02:43.402
You will need them yourself.

01:02:48.668 --> 01:02:51.382
But don’t leave me here.

01:02:51.383 --> 01:02:53.888
Don’t abandon me.

01:02:53.889 --> 01:02:55.809
Do it.

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:58.232
Aim at my heart.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:02:59.778
End it.

01:02:59.779 --> 01:03:02.033
Enough.

01:03:02.075 --> 01:03:04.880
In God’s name, enough.

01:03:05.961 --> 01:03:08.340
Do it, end it.

01:03:08.341 --> 01:03:10.136
Enough.

01:03:10.137 --> 01:03:12.726
My soldiers' are waiting for me, commander.

01:03:12.727 --> 01:03:15.315
They await me.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.365
Right now you are marble.

01:03:44.366 --> 01:03:47.873
Before your first mission we will
chisel your for 5 years.

01:03:47.874 --> 01:03:52.593
History, geography, medicine, chemistry,
guerilla warfare, psychology...

01:03:52.594 --> 01:03:55.432
...and languages will be your curriculum.

01:03:55.433 --> 01:03:59.903
You will either pass a difficult education
or again, be eliminated.

01:03:59.904 --> 01:04:01.948
You’re screwed, Bekir.

01:04:01.949 --> 01:04:04.997
Because you are the last castle.

01:04:04.998 --> 01:04:07.797
Men with knowledge as well as bravery...

01:04:07.798 --> 01:04:09.718
...those who do not bow to emotion...

01:04:09.719 --> 01:04:12.767
...first to go in, last to come out.

01:04:12.768 --> 01:04:16.734
You will save lives more
than you will take them.

01:04:16.735 --> 01:04:19.115
This will be a hard life.

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:21.914
Maybe a short one.

01:04:21.915 --> 01:04:25.130
Your families will share you with us.

01:04:25.131 --> 01:04:27.846
They will be happy with the crumbs.

01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:32.528
You’ll miss many graduations,
anniversaries and weddings.

01:04:32.529 --> 01:04:34.821
On your child’s birthday...

01:04:34.822 --> 01:04:38.556
...bullets will rain atop some mountain.

01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:41.128
Still, it will be worth every second.

01:04:41.129 --> 01:04:45.472
This love, is such a love
that even if it consumes you...

01:04:45.473 --> 01:04:47.978
...kills you...

01:04:47.979 --> 01:04:50.150
...you will never let go.

01:04:50.151 --> 01:04:53.205
Welcome amongst us, brothers.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.771
Sir, Çardaklı has visual.

01:05:34.344 --> 01:05:35.972
It looks so green.

01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:38.897
I guess Sinjar’s only stream
flows there.

01:05:38.898 --> 01:05:42.320
Five minutes rest, then we move on.

01:05:42.949 --> 01:05:45.452
Copy that.

01:05:45.496 --> 01:05:48.000
Are you Turuk?

01:05:48.003 --> 01:05:48.687
Excuse me?

01:05:48.688 --> 01:05:50.394
Turuk?

01:05:50.395 --> 01:05:52.052
Yes, we are Turks.

01:05:52.053 --> 01:05:54.482
I’m also Turuk.
Çardaklı is also kin.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:56.669
They are all Turuk.

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:59.573
Çardaklı is a Turkmen village.

01:05:59.574 --> 01:06:03.121
We are Turuk alright.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.266
Wafer?

01:06:17.267 --> 01:06:20.621
Not this time.

01:06:20.622 --> 01:06:22.105
Looks clean.

01:06:22.106 --> 01:06:25.388
Just some civilians.
Around 30 to 40.

01:06:25.389 --> 01:06:27.414
Where’s the LZ?

01:06:27.415 --> 01:06:28.978
Ahead, 100 meters lower altitude.

01:06:28.979 --> 01:06:34.079
We need to call the T- 70s sir.
They’ll just about make it.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:40.203
I can see Turkey from here.

01:06:44.649 --> 01:06:46.352
What’s your name?

01:06:46.353 --> 01:06:48.023
Enegül.

01:06:48.024 --> 01:06:49.332
Enegül.

01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:54.003
I’m Bekir, Enegül.
That is Oğuz.

01:06:54.004 --> 01:06:57.635
I tried talking, she doesn’t respond.

01:07:03.239 --> 01:07:06.388
They carved nasheeds on
her back with a knife.

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:09.867
Sons of whores.

01:07:09.868 --> 01:07:12.455
Then again, that only insults the whores.

01:07:12.456 --> 01:07:15.006
These are the realities you still ignore.

01:07:15.007 --> 01:07:18.355
This time, those who suffer aren’t arabs
or kurds either...

01:07:18.356 --> 01:07:22.171
...they are Iraqi Turks.

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:24.283
At least they will live.

01:07:24.284 --> 01:07:30.511
Here, in this barbarity...
How does one live?

01:07:32.253 --> 01:07:36.559
100 men, against 1000. How
do they survive?

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.788
This has no simple answer, gentlemen.

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:41.252
Is there a historical precedent? Yes.

01:07:41.253 --> 01:07:44.405
There are the Carthaginians.
Under Hannibal’s command.

01:07:44.406 --> 01:07:46.820
He did something similar at Cannae.

01:07:46.821 --> 01:07:49.549
Naturally, the truth is...

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:55.586
...we need to examine the english theorist
B.H. Liddell Hart and his concepts.

01:07:55.587 --> 01:07:59.647
During this battle, Romans were,
as always, too confident...

01:07:59.648 --> 01:08:00.564
You know what I miss?

01:08:00.565 --> 01:08:04.656
...in three main columns,
they attacked with the middle strongest.

01:08:04.657 --> 01:08:07.105
Fist- fighting you.

01:08:07.106 --> 01:08:11.624
I wish I could just tussle once
more before you became my superior.

01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:13.787
You’re seriously crazy, man.

01:08:13.788 --> 01:08:16.671
Bekir, Oğuz, what’s going on?

01:08:16.671 --> 01:08:20.529
Sir, our friend Bekir here
wants to fight me one last time.

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:22.136
You fucking rat.

01:08:22.136 --> 01:08:25.350
According to Hart’s doctrine
How do 10 men fight against 100?

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:28.745
Answer it properly, go out during
the break, and beat each other up.

01:08:28.746 --> 01:08:30.874
I'll allow it.

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:35.376
Sir, 1000 people will always crush 100.
Reality of numbers.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:39.098
The only way to win, according to Hart
is to fight indirectly.

01:08:39.099 --> 01:08:40.741
How, explain that too.

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:46.783
To focus on the vulnerable joints
using any trick and advantage possible.

01:08:46.785 --> 01:08:49.308
Oh yes.

01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:52.095
Our final fight.
The closing of an era.

01:08:52.096 --> 01:08:54.024
A clean punch to the face wins.

01:08:54.026 --> 01:08:56.075
What’s the matter bro?
Scared of two?

01:08:56.076 --> 01:08:58.098
May he who fears you, become you.

01:08:58.099 --> 01:09:03.870
Come on shithead.
Come.

01:09:03.871 --> 01:09:07.419
You’re learning something. Come.

01:09:18.595 --> 01:09:20.551
You alright?

01:09:20.551 --> 01:09:21.926
You alright man?

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:24.541
Dude... you indirect warfare shit.

01:09:24.542 --> 01:09:26.544
Who ever hits the nose?

01:09:26.545 --> 01:09:30.691
Sorry man, not intentional.
I’m not Emin Boztepe.

01:09:30.692 --> 01:09:33.948
Stop, don’t stand.
Look up.

01:09:36.558 --> 01:09:39.374
I fell in love with a girl.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.144
We met the other day.

01:09:41.145 --> 01:09:45.381
I think she likes me.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.246
100 billion galaxies.

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:51.254
In each one, 100 billion stars,
countless planets.

01:09:51.255 --> 01:09:53.694
And a girl likes Bekir.

01:09:53.694 --> 01:10:00.522
She might be the woman I marry.

01:10:00.523 --> 01:10:02.933
What the shit?

01:10:02.934 --> 01:10:06.483
You’re serious.

01:10:06.484 --> 01:10:10.759
Way to go Bekir. Live that life.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.723
How does one live a life?

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:28.419
Where the cloud casts a shadow,
that’s the LZ, sir.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:30.169
Looks like my hometown.

01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:33.592
Do they have 50 calibre
echoing in Bilecikm too?

01:10:33.593 --> 01:10:37.157
You don’t know our girls.

01:11:59.275 --> 01:12:01.327
Salam- u- Alaikum

01:12:01.328 --> 01:12:02.633
Alaykumu as- salām.

01:12:02.634 --> 01:12:05.242
Are you Turkish soldiers?

01:12:05.243 --> 01:12:08.529
-  We are.
-  Prepare qelyanalti, move it.

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:10.394
Qelyanalti?

01:12:10.395 --> 01:12:11.949
What is that?

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:14.592
Afternoon breakfast.

01:12:14.593 --> 01:12:18.425
Would be rude to refuse, right?

01:12:18.426 --> 01:12:20.885
I agree.

01:12:20.886 --> 01:12:23.304
Only fighter left in our village is Boran.

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:26.620
Go speak to him.

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.390
- Welcome.
- Hello.

01:12:31.391 --> 01:12:33.168
How many in this village, Boran?

01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:35.702
25 adults, 15 children.

01:12:35.703 --> 01:12:38.124
I’m the only one who
can carry a weapon, sir.

01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:42.703
Gentlemen, rest without bothering anyone..

01:12:42.704 --> 01:12:44.097
Last stop before returning home.

01:12:44.098 --> 01:12:49.535
You can rest in my home. Come.
Don’t stay out. Come in.

01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:07.014
Thanks, we are being a burden.

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.650
Don’t you mention it commander.

01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:11.418
The children here dream
of becoming Turkish soldiers.

01:13:11.419 --> 01:13:14.231
We grow up with your tales.

01:13:14.232 --> 01:13:17.959
- Your Turkish is great, Boran.
- I went to school in Gaziantep.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.334
Before the war my father
used to import from Turkey.

01:13:20.335 --> 01:13:23.243
The cobblestones on the village
square were his goods.

01:13:23.244 --> 01:13:25.844
After he died we never got to finish.

01:13:25.845 --> 01:13:29.372
If you don’t mind me asking,
what happened your leg?

01:13:29.373 --> 01:13:31.962
When those animals attacked
Talafar three years ago...

01:13:31.963 --> 01:13:35.022
...we went to defend as a family.

01:13:35.023 --> 01:13:37.088
I got one on the knee.

01:13:37.089 --> 01:13:42.291
Commander, these lands were
the most fertile around Sinjar.

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:45.353
Wheat and fruit used to grow
here.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.817
After the war all were ruined.

01:13:47.818 --> 01:13:50.497
Ottomans used to called this place
Turkmenreach.

01:13:50.498 --> 01:13:52.158
Nothing to reach anymore.

01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:56.940
We’re surrounded. Like an island
on a sea of arabs and kurds.

01:13:56.941 --> 01:14:01.679
Storm Bringer...

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.643
662 Tamu Cizre.
This is Storm Bringer.

01:14:04.644 --> 01:14:07.966
Our new call sign, 923 Mountain.

01:14:07.967 --> 01:14:12.309
Mountain, your signal is weak,
but copy that.

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:16.272
662 Tamu Cizre.
Mountain standing by.

01:14:16.737 --> 01:14:22.015
Mountain, this is Wolf. Veysel?

01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:25.412
I am here, sir.

01:14:25.413 --> 01:14:28.573
Terrorists crushed both Iraqi army
and the kurds. The region is falling.

01:14:28.574 --> 01:14:32.686
Their main battalion, 100 strong are
pillaging towards the last village.

01:14:32.687 --> 01:14:34.637
Are you ready for extraction?

01:14:34.638 --> 01:14:37.058
Which village?

01:14:37.059 --> 01:14:38.140
Çardaklı.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:45.822
Arrival noon tomorrow.
LZ confirmation.Exit before dawn. Over.

01:14:51.551 --> 01:14:52.645
I know commander.

01:14:52.646 --> 01:15:00.017
Let us see you off unharmed,
that alone is enough.

01:15:03.738 --> 01:15:06.583
Lt. Colonel, this is a Shia village.
- I know.

01:15:06.584 --> 01:15:09.085
Will you listen to me one minute?

01:15:09.086 --> 01:15:15.248
Veysel!

01:15:15.493 --> 01:15:17.877
They will kill slaughter everyone here.

01:15:17.878 --> 01:15:20.177
Our mission is not to defend them.

01:15:20.178 --> 01:15:24.311
- The mission isn’t the issue here.
- The mission is the entire issue!

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:28.580
My own feelings and desires are
of no consequence.

01:15:28.581 --> 01:15:34.250
The mission is the only issue.

01:15:34.251 --> 01:15:37.328
In your world, your sense of
responsibility means idealism.

01:15:37.329 --> 01:15:39.859
An altruistic dream of helping everyone.

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.447
In mine it’s to keep my men alive,
whom I love like family...

01:15:43.448 --> 01:15:46.318
...these brave, few men.

01:15:46.319 --> 01:15:49.379
The entire issue is the mission.

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.316
No, sir.

01:15:51.317 --> 01:15:55.075
The issue here, is
what bravery really is.

01:15:55.076 --> 01:15:59.085
Bravery is not killing the enemy, or
defending borders drawn on a map.

01:15:59.086 --> 01:16:01.760
There is only one righteous
reason for bravery in war.

01:16:01.761 --> 01:16:04.390
And that is defending the innocent.

01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:09.067
That war is coming commander.
That war is coming here.

01:16:09.068 --> 01:16:10.864
Does this village deserve it?

01:16:10.865 --> 01:16:14.078
Do these people deserve that fate?

01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:17.629
Say something.

01:16:23.729 --> 01:16:26.776
Enegül come here.

01:16:27.362 --> 01:16:29.784
Come, dear.

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:32.499
Tell her.

01:16:32.668 --> 01:16:34.898
Tell her so she knows.
Say "We’re leaving".

01:16:34.899 --> 01:16:37.663
Say "There won’t be a single living
person here, tomorrow afternoon”.

01:16:37.664 --> 01:16:39.751
What will they do to this girl, sir?

01:16:39.752 --> 01:16:41.882
Tell her, so she knows.

01:16:41.883 --> 01:16:44.397
Tell her!

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:52.012
If courage is leaving this girl,
and all the villagers to their fate...

01:16:52.013 --> 01:16:55.018
...I would rather be a coward.

01:16:55.562 --> 01:16:58.860
You can keep on being brave.

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:24.464
“Sir”? What are you doing here?

01:17:24.842 --> 01:17:27.098
It was crowded, I wanted some fresh air.

01:17:27.099 --> 01:17:29.519
What are you yourself doing out?
You’re a married man now.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.734
I was looking for you, dumbass.

01:17:31.735 --> 01:17:35.158
C’mon, it was my mother’s dying wish,
We have to make my dad dance.

01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:37.079
C’mon.

01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:41.005
Where is Ece by the way?

01:17:41.675 --> 01:17:43.595
We broke up.

01:17:43.596 --> 01:17:45.100
Why man?

01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:46.519
No idea.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.318
I guess 2 years with me,
is like 20 years with you.

01:17:52.786 --> 01:17:55.665
You know, I don’t have many friends.

01:17:56.378 --> 01:17:59.383
Actually I only have one.

01:17:59.928 --> 01:18:03.687
Thank God though, I get to
observe this one idiot.

01:18:03.688 --> 01:18:08.404
This guy thinks too much, Oğuz.
More he thinks, more he fucks up.

01:18:08.992 --> 01:18:12.208
He thinks he’s alone.

01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:15.464
But he ain’t.

01:18:15.883 --> 01:18:18.389
He needs to know this.

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:21.480
- This friend of yours?
- Exactly.

01:18:21.481 --> 01:18:24.026
I’ll tell him, if I see him.

01:18:24.489 --> 01:18:27.996
Bro, they told me a ring might
cause problems during a jump.

01:18:27.997 --> 01:18:30.753
We came up with this solution.

01:18:30.754 --> 01:18:32.172
Respect, man.

01:18:32.173 --> 01:18:34.220
3 years ago you said you’d get married.

01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:36.726
Here we are and you’re getting married.

01:18:36.727 --> 01:18:38.856
This is how we live, I guess.

01:18:38.857 --> 01:18:40.902
Learn by falling and getting back up.

01:18:40.903 --> 01:18:42.572
I wish you the same.

01:18:42.573 --> 01:18:44.744
Me?

01:18:44.745 --> 01:18:47.626
Yeah, I can’t do that. You’re
married to your right hand.

01:18:47.627 --> 01:18:49.880
Left.

01:18:52.264 --> 01:18:55.478
Get up come on. I need to watch
you ruin this dance, move it.

01:18:55.479 --> 01:18:57.860
Me? Not a chance.

01:18:57.861 --> 01:19:01.515
I’ll order you and you’ll fucking do it.

01:19:01.516 --> 01:19:02.934
C’mon.

01:19:02.935 --> 01:19:04.355
You know what?

01:19:04.356 --> 01:19:06.126
I beat you up so good that day,
I kinda miss it now.

01:19:06.126 --> 01:19:09.613
How quickly you forgot 3 years
ago. I popped your nose open.

01:19:09.613 --> 01:19:10.630
- Oh really?
- Yes really, move.

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:14.303
- Let’s see how you do in Ankara.
- Game on.

01:19:55.235 --> 01:20:00.023
Is Turkey pretty sister Ceyda?

01:20:00.023 --> 01:20:02.316
Dawn will break Enegül, go to sleep.

01:20:02.446 --> 01:20:02.316
Sister Nabat tell us. You went there.

01:20:06.916 --> 01:20:06.758
The soil is not orange like it is here.

01:20:10.299 --> 01:20:12.970
Ashen and green.

01:20:13.599 --> 01:20:16.355
There is cold and warm.

01:20:16.356 --> 01:20:21.198
Dew falls on flowers each
morning, without harming them.

01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:25.125
Their mountains have waterfalls.

01:20:25.336 --> 01:20:27.590
Their peaks aren’t bald like ours.

01:20:27.591 --> 01:20:29.846
They have it all.

01:20:29.847 --> 01:20:33.436
All the good, all the bad.

01:20:33.438 --> 01:20:38.908
When you walk in autumn, your feet
may be wet or dry.

01:20:39.913 --> 01:20:43.377
A bird may shit or land on you.

01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:45.426
Are their birds pretty?

01:20:45.427 --> 01:20:47.639
They are.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.605
Storks fly all around.

01:20:50.606 --> 01:20:54.823
Falcons hunt lesser birds on hills.

01:20:54.824 --> 01:20:59.291
Skylarks nest on city roofs.

01:20:59.628 --> 01:21:01.631
Their cities are like fields.

01:21:01.632 --> 01:21:05.515
Antep, İstanbul, Ankara.

01:21:05.516 --> 01:21:08.189
Buildings until the horizon.

01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:10.987
Will we go one day?

01:21:13.787 --> 01:21:15.666
We will, Enegül.

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:17.003
We will.

01:21:17.004 --> 01:21:19.256
Go to sleep.

01:21:29.325 --> 01:21:31.037
Sir.

01:21:31.038 --> 01:21:33.459
Bekir and Arif are on sentry.
Others are resting.

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.050
Cizre will send the T- 70 at dawn.

01:21:38.555 --> 01:21:41.228
You will be a good officer, Oğuz.

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.607
Despite me.

01:21:45.865 --> 01:21:49.081
20 years from now...

01:21:49.082 --> 01:21:53.884
...hundreds of men will look to
your words for everything...

01:21:53.885 --> 01:21:57.601
Some of them will be troopers,
natural born soldiers.

01:21:57.602 --> 01:22:00.358
Others young and foolish.

01:22:00.359 --> 01:22:04.825
But all of them will follow your
example, Oğuz.

01:22:04.995 --> 01:22:08.179
If you show wisdom and awareness,
they will be wise and aware...

01:22:08.179 --> 01:22:12.479
...if you show loyalty and bravery
they’ll grow to be loyal and brave.

01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:13.986
But above all...

01:22:13.987 --> 01:22:19.444
...those under your command will
live and die by your decisions, Oğuz.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:23.541
Then a day will come ...

01:22:23.541 --> 01:22:27.359
... Where'll you’ll have to decide between
what’s right and the mission.

01:22:27.434 --> 01:22:30.086
The right thing is the mission, sir..

01:22:30.087 --> 01:22:33.000
What’s right, is the right thing, Oğuz.

01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:43.416
I’ve ignored many right things for missions.

01:22:43.516 --> 01:22:47.196
Back when we were your age
we served southeast with Yaşar.

01:22:47.197 --> 01:22:49.845
We were both born and raised
in Eskişehir.

01:22:49.846 --> 01:22:54.914
But if you asked us the city 
of our origin, we’d say Şırnak.

01:22:54.915 --> 01:22:58.949
Not because of time stayed there...

01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:01.782
...but because of our souls we spent.

01:23:01.783 --> 01:23:06.444
If you only knew the friends we
had to lose for missions.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:08.500
Seven years ago, Captain Yaşar...

01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:11.339
...caught Bekir and I cussing at
each other once again.

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.734
We've already been warned 20 times.

01:23:13.735 --> 01:23:19.169
Seeing that we were hopeless he assigned 
a latrine to each and forbid us using any other.

01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:24.844
“You will clean your respective
shits every single day” he said.

01:23:24.845 --> 01:23:29.905
He had this smile on his face.

01:23:29.906 --> 01:23:35.257
He was smiling because they’d given
us the same punishment back in '88.

01:23:35.258 --> 01:23:43.584
We became so polite within a week.

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:46.824
He was my Bekir, Oğuz.

01:23:46.825 --> 01:23:50.291
My best friend.

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:55.194
I had chose the mission 
but unable to make it.

01:23:55.195 --> 01:23:59.734
He died because of me.

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:05.915
What would you do?

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:07.501
Sir, I...

01:24:08.324 --> 01:24:11.335
My head says we need to get out.

01:24:11.336 --> 01:24:13.814
This has no end
and numbers never lie.

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.562
True.

01:24:15.563 --> 01:24:19.613
But my heart, sir...

01:24:19.614 --> 01:24:22.494
...it’s trying to fool me.

01:24:22.495 --> 01:24:27.449
Says we can’t abandon villagers to murder.

01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:29.590
Maybe, there’s a chance that...

01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:32.169
...we defend this place and live...

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:37.725
...then look back and say that
as Turkish soldiers...

01:24:37.726 --> 01:24:47.803
...we did the right thing
as well as our duty.

01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:14.518
Commander, what is going on?

01:27:14.519 --> 01:27:16.730
All the village children have boarded.

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:22.810
Time for the unruly one.

01:27:22.811 --> 01:27:25.466
- I won’t go.
- You’re the mission, Ceyda.

01:27:25.467 --> 01:27:27.583
I’ll do something, sir. I can be
of use!

01:27:27.584 --> 01:27:31.744
No. You returning, is not
open to discussion.

01:27:31.745 --> 01:27:34.489
Just promise me one thing.

01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:37.914
You will not speak of this.
You will not write it.

01:27:37.915 --> 01:27:40.570
It will be a secret forever.

01:27:40.571 --> 01:27:42.189
Why?

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.025
We are nothing.

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:47.367
Shadows. What we do must not be known.

01:27:47.368 --> 01:27:53.510
Promise me.

01:27:59.643 --> 01:28:04.790
I promise!

01:28:11.131 --> 01:28:16.360
Open it when you arrive.

01:29:00.589 --> 01:29:02.880
071 Wolf, this is Mountain.

01:29:02.881 --> 01:29:04.965
Mountain, this is Wolf.
Your orders were clear!

01:29:04.966 --> 01:29:08.256
Why have you not exfil?!
What the hell are you doing Veysel?

01:29:08.257 --> 01:29:10.396
Sir we’ve delivered Ceyda.

01:29:10.397 --> 01:29:14.370
But they had to leave early
due to the coming storm.

01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:18.182
What storm Veysel?!

01:29:18.183 --> 01:29:25.301
Sir, I will consult my team
one by one, just to be sure.

01:29:25.302 --> 01:29:31.449
Master Sergeant Mustafa Şahin.
I concur with my commander.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:36.640
Staff Sergeant Arif Sayar.
I agree, sir.

01:29:36.641 --> 01:29:42.097
First Lieutenant Oğuz.
The weather is terrible, sir.

01:29:42.098 --> 01:29:47.358
Sergeant Baybars Yücel.
I concur, sir.

01:29:48.715 --> 01:29:53.466
Specialist Bekir Özbey.
Likewise sir.

01:29:58.788 --> 01:30:05.042
Master Sergeant Eşref Çullu.
A storm is coming, sir.

01:30:10.289 --> 01:30:15.208
We have team comfirmation.
What is your orders, sir?

01:30:15.799 --> 01:30:21.990
-  Noted.
-  Standing by for orders, Sir?.

01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:29.691
We'll try again tomorrow.
May God help you all. Out.

01:30:34.265 --> 01:30:37.144
In 1950, we used to say ‘Iraqi Turks’.

01:30:37.145 --> 01:30:40.995
Then we're forced
to call them Turkmen.

01:30:40.996 --> 01:30:45.843
For us, land that is to be defended,
is land where our people live.

01:30:45.844 --> 01:30:48.183
These villagers are our people.

01:30:48.184 --> 01:30:50.713
- Eşref, you have it with you?
- Always, sir.

01:30:50.714 --> 01:30:52.612
- Baybars?
- Your orders, sir.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:55.546
Go, raise it on the village peak.

01:30:55.547 --> 01:31:00.363
Today, this place is homeland.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.215
This is not an American film.

01:31:25.216 --> 01:31:28.467
Last minute air support won’t
clear out those hundred men.

01:31:28.468 --> 01:31:29.594
Mustafa.

01:31:29.595 --> 01:31:31.532
Everything is here sir.

01:31:31.533 --> 01:31:33.854
4 mags per rifle.

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:36.562
I got two rockets, for emergencies.

01:31:36.563 --> 01:31:40.183
I can rig the C4’s for remote
detonation with a comm.

01:31:40.184 --> 01:31:43.355
The village also has some gasoline.

01:31:43.356 --> 01:31:46.009
I'll crack open the DskH rounds...

01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:49.766
... and fill the shells and powder
inside gas canisters as shrapnel...

01:31:49.767 --> 01:31:53.119
Good. Divide all the benzene and
paraffin equally.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.575
Oğuz, explain.

01:31:54.576 --> 01:31:56.643
There are two routes into the village.

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:59.271
The mosque path and the school path.

01:31:59.272 --> 01:32:02.002
The mosque path is wider
but we got a choke point here.

01:32:02.003 --> 01:32:04.286
This is the joint. Vehicles
must cross here.

01:32:04.287 --> 01:32:06.608
We can use it.

01:32:06.609 --> 01:32:08.307
I can rig a killbox with the C4’s.

01:32:08.308 --> 01:32:10.752
Two on each side of the road.

01:32:10.753 --> 01:32:14.070
- Will take care of every truck.
- Then what?

01:32:14.071 --> 01:32:17.163
No IED will kill 100 men.

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:21.647
Man to man engagement if they slip pass.

01:32:21.648 --> 01:32:25.497
I just wish we had a
guardian angel.

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:31.599
You will go high.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.054
Always wanted to be a muezzin as a kid.

01:32:34.055 --> 01:32:38.169
- Why didn’t you do it?
- They said I had a horrible voice.

01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:40.387
If they reach iron sights I’m fucked.

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:45.095
Need someone to keep the mosque clean.

01:32:45.096 --> 01:32:48.244
- Boran, can you do this?
- Say die, and I’ll die, sir.

01:32:48.245 --> 01:32:49.880
How do we position sir?

01:32:49.881 --> 01:32:52.239
You, Mustafa, Oğuz and I, 
we’re the vanguard.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.334
After we collect our blood toll
at the bottleneck...

01:32:55.335 --> 01:33:00.752
...we come here, to point green,
to you and Mustafa.

01:33:10.079 --> 01:33:14.355
‘Baybars Cocktail’.

01:33:14.356 --> 01:33:16.283
Yücel Cocktail.

01:33:16.284 --> 01:33:19.824
Molotov was his surname.

01:33:19.825 --> 01:33:22.757
They must never know our real numbers.

01:33:22.758 --> 01:33:26.273
We need someone to run around,
carrying ammo to displacers.

01:33:26.274 --> 01:33:28.871
Veysel Commander?

01:33:28.872 --> 01:33:36.630
Let me help.

01:33:36.631 --> 01:33:42.223
The battle makes the warrior.

01:33:42.224 --> 01:33:48.391
Let me help.

01:33:48.392 --> 01:33:53.610
No mercy for those who try
to take this village.

01:33:53.611 --> 01:33:56.736
Make every invader crawl.

01:33:56.737 --> 01:34:00.867
They will curse the day they
first took a step here.

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:02.708
They won’t fear death.

01:34:02.733 --> 01:34:04.834
They’ll fear us.

01:34:04.992 --> 01:34:08.090
Village flank is the only weak
point. Where the school faces.

01:34:08.091 --> 01:34:10.018
How many rounds do you have left?

01:34:10.019 --> 01:34:11.738
300.

01:34:11.739 --> 01:34:13.459
I’ll be stingy.

01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:16.351
- What is this place?
- Coalhouse.

01:34:16.352 --> 01:34:18.248
It has a shelter under it.

01:34:18.249 --> 01:34:20.372
Bring all remaining civilians here.

01:34:20.373 --> 01:34:22.885
This place falls, the village falls.

01:34:22.886 --> 01:34:25.064
The Last Castle.

01:34:25.065 --> 01:34:28.017
Sir. This is not the Last Castle.

01:34:28.018 --> 01:34:33.238
We are.

01:34:53.639 --> 01:35:01.088
No matter what
keep the door closed.

01:35:01.322 --> 01:35:04.256
Sir, please. Ceyda is gone.
If you would only allow it.

01:35:04.257 --> 01:35:06.477
Keep the comms on so I can hear.

01:35:06.478 --> 01:35:09.494
Use only initials.

01:35:09.495 --> 01:35:12.062
And you can’t ask me.

01:35:12.063 --> 01:35:14.279
Go ahead then.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.319
Well, I was just a kid
back then, 15 or 16.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.985
Her initial was “E”.

01:35:20.986 --> 01:35:22.903
She was 3- 4 years older than I.

01:35:22.904 --> 01:35:26.742
You know how you look at something
disgusting and cringe?

01:35:26.743 --> 01:35:31.330
That’s how she looked at me, like shit.

01:35:31.331 --> 01:35:34.269
Turns out she liked me.

01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:36.481
Then she invites me to drink lemonade.

01:35:36.482 --> 01:35:40.328
I swear, sir, next thing I know
I open my eyes in her bedroom.

01:35:40.329 --> 01:35:42.875
Somehow, it really happened.

01:35:42.876 --> 01:35:47.052
For 11 seconds.

01:35:47.053 --> 01:35:49.222
A.

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.160
From Sarıyer.

01:35:51.161 --> 01:35:52.638
We had dated for a year.

01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:54.412
I took her to a romantic dinner.

01:35:54.413 --> 01:35:56.891
She was pretty scared.

01:35:56.892 --> 01:35:59.143
As if I’d dump her 
after we made love.

01:35:59.144 --> 01:36:00.973
But that’s not what happened.

01:36:00.974 --> 01:36:03.702
We dated for another 1.5 years.

01:36:03.702 --> 01:36:07.449
Then she dumped me.
Who would've thought.

01:36:07.449 --> 01:36:11.168
Mine was also a girlfriend. Z.

01:36:11.168 --> 01:36:13.099
And?

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.614
That’s all you need to know rookie.

01:36:14.615 --> 01:36:15.955
Sheesh.

01:36:15.956 --> 01:36:22.128
It’s going to be pretty hard for
Sergeant Mustafa to remember 60 years ago.

01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:24.177
F.

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:26.454
She was singer.

01:36:26.455 --> 01:36:28.108
A singer?!

01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:30.617
In a tavern.

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:33.924
Met her on the first day of rookie leave.

01:36:33.925 --> 01:36:36.483
Seeing my haircut, 
thought I was an officer.

01:36:36.484 --> 01:36:38.459
I didn't deny it.

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:44.519
Then, in a couple of months. I gathered 
my courage and declared my love.

01:36:44.519 --> 01:36:48.068
Oh God.

01:36:48.069 --> 01:36:52.160
It was the 80’s. Everybody was romantic.

01:36:52.161 --> 01:36:54.387
F was an incredible woman.

01:36:54.388 --> 01:36:55.860
Breasts the size of my head.

01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:58.753
She's like a film star
and a diva rolled into one.

01:36:58.753 --> 01:37:01.005
Wonder where she is now.

01:37:02.256 --> 01:37:04.462
I was 19.

01:37:04.462 --> 01:37:07.625
Had a two year girlfriend.

01:37:07.625 --> 01:37:11.740
We were into each other,
but could never be alone.

01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.299
Couldn’t get past second base.

01:37:13.299 --> 01:37:14.673
Anyways,

01:37:14.698 --> 01:37:18.814
she had this best friend. Whom would 
invite me to help with her homework.

01:37:18.814 --> 01:37:20.500
B.

01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:22.874
She seduced me a little.

01:37:22.875 --> 01:37:27.454
I was a teen so I couldn’t resist.

01:37:27.455 --> 01:37:30.150
Well, after my girl found out,
of course she dumped my ass.

01:37:30.151 --> 01:37:32.319
Woah...

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.968
You see sir...

01:37:33.969 --> 01:37:35.572
...this scoundrel...

01:37:35.573 --> 01:37:37.850
should have been eliminated.

01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:42.654
Funny thing is, they’re still besties.

01:37:47.438 --> 01:37:50.126
I’m a classic guy.

01:37:50.127 --> 01:37:55.320
Sebahat. My first and only love.

01:37:55.321 --> 01:37:58.614
She was the beauty of Akçaabat.

01:37:58.615 --> 01:38:01.769
We got hitched a day before deployment.

01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:05.149
Couldn’t wait, in event 
something happens to me.

01:38:05.150 --> 01:38:08.380
Next day I was on a convoy to Kerşan camp.

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.930
Suddenly an RPG hit our 
Unimog’s rear tire.

01:38:10.941 --> 01:38:12.919
Two died on impact.

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.107
PKM rounds bouncing everywhere.

01:38:16.108 --> 01:38:17.670
Then I realize, I’m shaking.

01:38:17.671 --> 01:38:19.726
Thnking I’ll never see Sebahat again.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:24.691
I accept it. You know how people
feel, ‘nothing will happen to me’...

01:38:24.692 --> 01:38:26.748
...this was the moment it ended.

01:38:26.749 --> 01:38:31.383
A sergeant with shrapnel sticking out of his
jaw screams at us to remain calm...

01:38:31.384 --> 01:38:35.505
...he puts in a cassette. Rock music
begins playing in the vehicle.

01:38:35.506 --> 01:38:40.124
Outside ricochets keep rhythm..

01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:43.618
Suddenly I begin enjoying it.

01:38:43.619 --> 01:38:45.865
I realize I’m probably going insane.

01:38:45.866 --> 01:38:47.822
You were a kid back then Eşref.

01:38:47.823 --> 01:38:51.289
Frankly sir, I still got the same feeling.

01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:53.432
Only now, I never shake.

01:38:53.433 --> 01:38:56.270
I’ll find Sebahat even if I die.

01:38:56.271 --> 01:38:59.592
- Visual!
- It’s time, gentleman.

01:39:03.601 --> 01:39:06.298
Arif, talk to me.

01:39:06.299 --> 01:39:07.803
Battalion.

01:39:07.804 --> 01:39:15.595
200 plus change. 
8 tactical Hiluxes.

01:39:15.596 --> 01:39:18.101
And one Abrams.

01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:39.616
Abrams?

01:39:39.617 --> 01:39:40.897
More good news.

01:39:40.898 --> 01:39:43.095
- What’s the formation?
- Two columns, sir.

01:39:43.096 --> 01:39:45.309
Infantry ahead and rear.
Classic Saddam.

01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:48.650
Five minutes.

01:39:56.289 --> 01:40:00.097
Fear is good.
You’ll run faster.

01:40:00.098 --> 01:40:02.224
They have a tank!

01:40:02.225 --> 01:40:06.417
But we have a Bekir.

01:40:07.216 --> 01:40:10.322
Eşref, do what you do best.

01:40:10.323 --> 01:40:16.395
And if you get exposed earman,
know that I watch over you.

01:40:16.396 --> 01:40:22.436
- Bekir?
- Ready sir.

01:40:22.437 --> 01:40:29.153
Come, all of you.

01:40:30.406 --> 01:40:33.411
Wear this.

01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:42.472
Would this stop a bullet, sir?

01:40:42.473 --> 01:40:45.229
No. But it will stop ricochets.

01:40:53.386 --> 01:40:55.014
Take cover. Over there.

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:57.473
They’re approaching the chokepoint.

01:40:57.474 --> 01:41:04.961
Arif, shrink your profile.

01:41:07.537 --> 01:41:09.763
Brave die once, cowards thousands.

01:41:09.764 --> 01:41:13.105
Brave die once, cowards thousands.

01:41:13.106 --> 01:41:15.568
Use Channel 4 for detonation.

01:41:15.710 --> 01:41:18.130
One. Two.

01:41:25.936 --> 01:41:27.812
Three.

01:41:50.714 --> 01:41:54.252
The road is narrow.

01:41:54.546 --> 01:41:57.310
Move the men and trucks first!

01:41:59.736 --> 01:42:01.939
Trucks! Trucks!

01:42:11.468 --> 01:42:13.513
Four.

01:42:15.921 --> 01:42:18.716
Now.

01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:24.825
Move! Move!

01:42:25.746 --> 01:42:28.250
Why yell on a mountain?

01:42:28.251 --> 01:42:30.170
To defy fate.

01:42:38.608 --> 01:42:40.608
Move!

01:42:53.971 --> 01:42:55.971
Move!

01:43:22.705 --> 01:43:24.792
Flanks!

01:44:05.769 --> 01:44:09.192
Move it!

01:44:10.868 --> 01:44:13.901
Baybars! We can’t hold this tank!

01:44:13.902 --> 01:44:16.615
Run to the chokepoint!

01:44:28.349 --> 01:44:31.396
Boran, get ready!

01:44:38.368 --> 01:44:42.166
Arif, they’re leaking in!

01:44:47.707 --> 01:44:49.877
Bekir, back! Covering fire!

01:45:48.013 --> 01:45:49.826
You’re doing good.

01:45:49.827 --> 01:45:53.844
Press the comm. Say the mosque is clean.

01:45:53.845 --> 01:45:56.265
Repeat what I said.

01:45:57.208 --> 01:45:59.795
The mosque is clean.

01:46:15.905 --> 01:46:17.418
You again?

01:46:17.419 --> 01:46:19.849
I can’t even die alone?

01:46:19.849 --> 01:46:20.342
Eşref!?

01:46:20.733 --> 01:46:22.318
- Two.
- Two.

01:46:22.319 --> 01:46:24.374
Two.

01:46:24.375 --> 01:46:27.772
Baybars, where’s my SMAW 
(Shoulder-launched Multi-purpose Assault Weapon)?!

01:47:05.859 --> 01:47:07.685
Sweet roses blossom

01:47:07.686 --> 01:47:11.374
So the bees taste

01:47:11.375 --> 01:47:16.449
Roses pinned to chests

01:47:16.450 --> 01:47:19.750
To wither in time

01:47:31.097 --> 01:47:33.332
Arif.

01:47:33.333 --> 01:47:36.568
Arif, get down!

01:47:41.022 --> 01:47:43.860
Load up!

01:47:44.152 --> 01:47:47.533
Arif, move!

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:33.098
Arif, come in, Arif.
- They are in the village, sir.

01:48:33.098 --> 01:48:36.395
Arif, Get to Last Castle.

01:49:34.904 --> 01:49:38.260
Sir. The flank is falling.

01:49:38.261 --> 01:49:41.850
On our way, Baybars.

01:49:50.413 --> 01:49:56.524
Guys, fall back. We’re right behind you!

01:49:56.525 --> 01:50:00.546
Sir, I'll cover you.

01:50:00.547 --> 01:50:03.167
- Mustafa.
- Sir.

01:50:03.168 --> 01:50:09.054
The other day my son asked
"Dad are you a hero?".

01:50:09.055 --> 01:50:12.130
What did you say?

01:50:12.131 --> 01:50:15.157
I said I was not...

01:50:15.158 --> 01:50:19.735
...but that I served under one.

01:50:28.863 --> 01:50:31.700
Go!

01:50:32.707 --> 01:50:34.423
Humans grow from the cradle

01:50:34.424 --> 01:50:36.551
To lie sleep in the grave

01:50:48.326 --> 01:50:50.955
Cover me!

01:50:55.625 --> 01:50:57.261
Arif, how many do you see?

01:50:57.262 --> 01:50:59.055
10, sir.

01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:01.917
9.

01:51:01.918 --> 01:51:06.248
Arif, Remember my son?

01:51:06.248 --> 01:51:10.309
Of course I do, sir. 
Handsome like his dad.

01:51:15.722 --> 01:51:17.998
Arif! Behind!

01:51:32.179 --> 01:51:34.119
Boran!

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:38.674
- Hang in there buddy!
- I’m good, sir.

01:51:56.467 --> 01:51:58.720
Promise.

01:51:58.721 --> 01:52:02.019
He will be my ward, sir!

01:52:08.162 --> 01:52:11.042
Heroes gladly fall

01:52:11.043 --> 01:52:12.880
To protect their homeland

01:52:12.881 --> 01:52:15.051
One dies,

01:52:15.052 --> 01:52:18.350
a thousand rise!

01:52:40.238 --> 01:52:41.784
Arif, sitrep.

01:52:41.785 --> 01:52:43.622
Eşref’s here sir.

01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:45.229
Boran...

01:52:45.230 --> 01:52:47.316
- Boran what?
- He’s critically wounded.

01:52:47.317 --> 01:52:50.532
Get out of there now.

01:52:56.298 --> 01:52:59.638
Bring Arif and the others.
- Yes sir.

01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:03.648
- Bekir?
- Huh?

01:53:04.819 --> 01:53:05.947
Thanks.

01:53:05.948 --> 01:53:07.658
What, why?

01:53:07.659 --> 01:53:09.955
Just, thanks.

01:53:10.876 --> 01:53:13.255
I ain’t used to this, scrub.

01:53:13.256 --> 01:53:16.179
I’d expect daft history lessons from you.

01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:18.267
Huns, Ithiopans, Hittites and stuff.

01:53:18.268 --> 01:53:21.484
- Ethiopian.
- What?

01:53:21.485 --> 01:53:23.905
They are called Ethiopians.

01:53:25.536 --> 01:53:27.624
That’s more fucking like it.

01:53:27.625 --> 01:53:29.962
Let’s go.

01:54:26.769 --> 01:54:29.690
- Eşref!
- Eşref!

01:54:29.902 --> 01:54:32.656
Eşref!

01:54:33.702 --> 01:54:35.871
Eşref!

01:54:39.758 --> 01:54:41.929
Don’t.

01:54:44.938 --> 01:54:46.482
Where’d it come from?

01:54:46.483 --> 01:54:48.362
Shield.

01:54:48.363 --> 01:54:49.658
What?

01:54:49.659 --> 01:54:51.579
Make me your shield.

01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:53.875
Eşref, I’m won’t leave you here.

01:54:53.876 --> 01:54:59.137
I can’t feel my legs.
Use your head, Arif.

01:55:00.642 --> 01:55:03.606
Make me your shield.

01:55:04.737 --> 01:55:07.240
Come on.

01:55:24.368 --> 01:55:28.041
4 o’clock.

01:55:34.099 --> 01:55:37.479
Tell Sebahat.

01:55:40.531 --> 01:55:43.494
I know, you’ll find her.

01:56:01.249 --> 01:56:03.504
Are you excited Bekir?

01:56:03.505 --> 01:56:08.432
A little, sir, mostly because
I get to have a stubble after today.

01:56:08.433 --> 01:56:11.732
You already know Baybars,
your classmate.

01:56:11.733 --> 01:56:14.531
Everybody can do everything in MAK 8.

01:56:14.532 --> 01:56:17.152
But we also have specialists
among us.

01:56:17.152 --> 01:56:20.995
Arif is our marksman,
Baybars will be heavy weapons.

01:56:20.995 --> 01:56:23.794
Earman (Eşref) is infiltration.

01:56:23.795 --> 01:56:26.841
Why do they say Earman?

01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:32.397
If Eşref likes you, maybe one day
he’ll tell the tale, Bekir.

01:56:32.398 --> 01:56:35.613
Don’t worry, nobody likes him.

01:56:36.577 --> 01:56:38.580
Sir?

01:56:38.581 --> 01:56:42.422
Why do we fold each other’s parachutes?

01:56:42.423 --> 01:56:44.302
So that you remember.

01:56:44.303 --> 01:56:47.058
No man is responsible for himself only.

01:56:47.059 --> 01:56:50.440
We always take care of each other first.

01:56:52.532 --> 01:56:54.118
Ready!?

01:56:54.119 --> 01:56:55.830
Did you fold it properly?

01:56:55.831 --> 01:56:59.547
Can’t recall really.

01:57:39.186 --> 01:57:41.356
Eşref?

01:58:00.531 --> 01:58:04.019
Sir, they’re surrounding us.

01:58:04.019 --> 01:58:07.276
Everybody load up.

01:58:10.807 --> 01:58:12.608
Last!

01:58:12.609 --> 01:58:14.695
Last.

01:58:19.862 --> 01:58:21.823
Last.

01:58:22.086 --> 01:58:25.884
Nabat, I’ll help you to the shelter.

01:58:26.179 --> 01:58:30.185
The battle makes the warrior, commander.

02:00:07.843 --> 02:00:10.556
Oğuz, wake up. Oğuz!

02:00:18.003 --> 02:00:20.505
Bekir!

02:00:33.688 --> 02:00:37.445
One. One, two, three.

02:00:47.879 --> 02:00:51.998
'Allah is Great'! 'Allah is Great'!

02:00:51.998 --> 02:00:54.395
'Allah is Great'!

02:02:04.888 --> 02:02:05.889
No!

02:02:05.890 --> 02:02:08.395
Sir!

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:38.386
Sir.

02:02:38.387 --> 02:02:40.974
Sir!

02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:33.551
I had a daughter Ceyda.

02:03:33.552 --> 02:03:37.185
If she had lived I’d want 
her to be like you.

02:03:37.186 --> 02:03:42.279
With heart, knowledge, defiance.

02:03:44.704 --> 02:03:48.169
I’d want criticizing the 
country and the military.

02:03:48.170 --> 02:03:51.052
The state, and the people too.

02:03:51.053 --> 02:03:55.184
I’d want her uncovering our faults.

02:03:55.437 --> 02:03:58.317
Just as long as she had love.

02:04:02.163 --> 02:04:06.045
Love for the country and all its faults.

02:04:06.046 --> 02:04:09.553
If you want to honor us...

02:04:09.973 --> 02:04:13.020
...just love, Ceyda.

02:04:33.824 --> 02:04:36.453
Remember the good things...

02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:39.336
...our banter...

02:04:39.337 --> 02:04:44.180
...brotherhood and the laughter.

02:04:45.059 --> 02:04:47.311
Remember the football match.

02:04:49.319 --> 02:04:51.531
Bekir.

02:04:51.532 --> 02:04:55.792
Tell them my last command was to
extract all remaining villagers.

02:04:55.793 --> 02:04:58.672
They won’t refuse.

02:04:59.844 --> 02:05:02.265
Oğuz.

02:05:19.977 --> 02:05:22.481
Don’t forget.

02:05:22.943 --> 02:05:25.864
The reason...

02:05:26.582 --> 02:05:30.988
...don’t forget it.

02:06:06.707 --> 02:06:10.233
We’ve laid out all the plans
from HQ, sir.

02:06:10.234 --> 02:06:12.945
Normally they ransom, but not now.

02:06:12.946 --> 02:06:15.636
Ceyda put the yezidi on the news...

02:06:15.637 --> 02:06:17.238
...they’ll execute her.

02:06:17.239 --> 02:06:20.891
It will take at least a week for them
to move south of Raqqa to the mountain.

02:06:20.892 --> 02:06:24.875
We need to make
good use of that week.

02:06:24.876 --> 02:06:30.023
Know why we are saving this woman?

02:06:30.024 --> 02:06:37.324
A known journalist who built a career
on criticizing us.

02:06:37.325 --> 02:06:40.319
Being a Turk used to
have some meaning.

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:44.236
- Still does, sir.
- Does it?

02:06:44.236 --> 02:06:46.954
Does it, still?

02:06:46.954 --> 02:06:50.150
They will behead a Turkish woman
and record it on camera.

02:06:50.150 --> 02:06:55.024
The world will watch.

02:06:57.917 --> 02:07:01.265
Beyond all duties, we soldiers
have a moral duty.

02:07:01.265 --> 02:07:05.324
To put our life and our existence
on the line for the benefit...

02:07:05.325 --> 02:07:10.215
...of all of our people, and stand
with them against any enemy.

02:07:10.216 --> 02:07:11.912
She can hate us...

02:07:11.913 --> 02:07:16.718
...or love us, makes no difference.
Our duty is absolute to our people.

02:07:16.719 --> 02:07:20.568
That responsibility is why you exist.

02:07:20.569 --> 02:07:24.176
It’s why you’re coming with us.

02:07:24.177 --> 02:07:26.026
Gentlemen.

02:07:26.027 --> 02:07:30.267
This is your first MAK 8 operation.

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.227
The time has come.

02:07:47.228 --> 02:07:51.894
Indeed it has.

02:07:51.895 --> 02:07:55.722
Time to let live.

02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:38.614
Sir, through pass!

02:09:39.535 --> 02:09:42.058
- Let do dammit.
- C’mon Oğuz!

02:09:42.059 --> 02:09:46.291
- Penalty!
- No it was nothing.

02:09:46.292 --> 02:09:48.214
- What happened?
- Penalty.

02:09:48.215 --> 02:09:49.895
What penalty sir?
Sheesh.

02:09:49.896 --> 02:09:51.527
Bekir, don’t offend a superior officer.

02:09:51.528 --> 02:09:53.861
Aw sir, this here is peer pressure
from rank.

02:09:53.862 --> 02:09:55.212
I used to be a civilian too!

02:09:55.213 --> 02:09:58.998
Sir you already gave us
this half- lame...

02:09:58.999 --> 02:10:01.058
If you‘re all going whine
let’s stop playing.

02:10:01.059 --> 02:10:02.689
You already have Baybars as keeper.

02:10:02.690 --> 02:10:04.616
Oh! Poor officers are sad.

02:10:04.617 --> 02:10:11.046
It’s alright sir. Win the game.

02:10:12.287 --> 02:10:14.745
Get used to how officers are, Bekir.

02:10:14.746 --> 02:10:16.121
They got the easy life.
Easy life!

02:10:17.710 --> 02:10:20.751
- You too Brutus?
- Oh didn’t see you here sir!

02:10:20.752 --> 02:10:22.515
Well this has to stop.

02:10:22.516 --> 02:10:25.898
I’m forming MAK 11.
NCOs only!

02:10:25.899 --> 02:10:28.842
C’mon move!

02:10:28.843 --> 02:10:30.177
We can do this!

02:10:30.633 --> 02:10:36.396
Still lots of places to go to
They’ll never forget us here

02:10:36.486 --> 02:10:41.875
We’ll sing a folk song and leave

02:10:41.875 --> 02:10:47.763
We’ve existed by loving, being loved

02:10:47.763 --> 02:10:53.074
Sometimes fighting, dying, rising

02:10:53.074 --> 02:10:58.784
Baked in an oven of meaning

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:04.340
We adore wise beauties and leave

02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:09.866
We adore wise beauties and leave

02:11:09.866 --> 02:11:17.691
We leave after paying all dues

02:11:17.691 --> 02:11:21.811
We leave singing a song that endures

02:11:22.305 --> 02:11:28.776
