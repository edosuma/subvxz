00:08.399 --> 00:11.011
Previously onMom...So I came home,

00:11.054 --> 00:12.447
marched right
into the bathroom,

00:12.490 --> 00:14.536
told Andy I wanted
to deepen our relationship,

00:14.579 --> 00:16.407
and you know what he said?

00:16.451 --> 00:18.540
"Can I finish my shower first?"

00:19.584 --> 00:22.022
When I get home I just want
to take a shower and relax.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.198
I don't want to talk
about my feelings.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.461
Especially when I'm not
wearing pants.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.332
It's Jill. Safety first.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.292
Andy wants a break from her.

00:32.684 --> 00:35.078
Tammy, alcoholic.ALL: Hi, Tammy.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.558
Lately I've been looking
for ways to deepen

00:36.601 --> 00:37.907
my spiritual connection,

00:37.950 --> 00:41.345
so, um, I decided to takea peaceful nature hike.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.653
No phones, no earbuds,not even gum.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.134
And that's when I realized

00:47.177 --> 00:51.921
hell is other people
while also walking uphill.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.401
This couple behind me--
and I feel compelled

00:53.444 --> 00:56.099
to point out that the guy
was wearing leggings--

00:56.143 --> 00:59.407
anyway, they were going on
and on in great gory detail

00:59.450 --> 01:01.800
about this tick that had
set up shop in his...

01:01.844 --> 01:04.412
well, let's just say
his swimsuit area.

01:05.630 --> 01:09.069
She told me this
one over breakfast.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.548
I mean, how am I supposed
to achieve inner peace

01:10.592 --> 01:12.463
when I'm listening to them
yakking about hot compresses

01:12.507 --> 01:14.422
and tweezer angles and himpassed out on the kitchen table?

01:14.465 --> 01:15.771
I thought, "You know,

01:15.814 --> 01:17.164
I'll just speed up
so I don't have to hear it."

01:17.207 --> 01:18.904
But then I realized I'd neverknow how it turned out,

01:18.948 --> 01:22.125
so I pretended to drink waterto catch the end.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.518
He's fine.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.434
He just needs the leggingsto trust the woods again.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.307
Anyway, I never
connected with God,

01:30.351 --> 01:32.657
but I do know what to do
in case a tick

01:32.701 --> 01:35.747
ever sets up shop in my hoo-ha.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.099
[applause]

01:39.142 --> 01:42.058
Someone else, please.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.495
Jill, alcoholic.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.844
ALL:
Hi, Jill.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.325
Well, Andy and I
are still on pause.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.848
I guess we have
a different definition

01:49.892 --> 01:51.328
of what "pause" means.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.941
See, now, that was a pause.

01:55.985 --> 01:59.684
Oh, she was acting. I didn't
know what was happening.

01:59.728 --> 02:03.079
People, we're at day 16,
and I'm coming unglued.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.733
I'm also regretting the fact
that I let Andy be the one

02:04.776 --> 02:06.996
who gets to say, "Pause over."
[chuckles]

02:07.039 --> 02:11.522
I just wish I knew what
was going on in his head.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.220
I mean, he has told me
that sometimes I can be

02:13.263 --> 02:17.006
a bit too much, but if
loving hard and living large

02:17.049 --> 02:19.487
means I'm too much,
then guilty as charged.

02:22.490 --> 02:26.233
I just feel so helpless,
and as we all know,

02:26.276 --> 02:28.713
that is a dangerous feeling
for an alcoholic.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.892
But I mean, I-I'm not gonna
drink or use over it.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.678
I may have gone
on a bit of a shopping spree,

02:36.721 --> 02:39.724
American Express called
to make sure I was okay.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.639
They're so sweet.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.902
Anyway, thanks.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.904
[applause][clears throat]

02:45.948 --> 02:47.079
Bonnie, alcoholic.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.516
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.821
Don't worry, Jill.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.736
Adam and Andy are watching
football tonight,

02:51.780 --> 02:53.390
so I'll find out
what's going on in his head.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.957
I'm sorry,
I know that was cross talk,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.177
but she usually sits next to meand I just whisper to her

02:57.220 --> 02:59.222
while Marjorie drones on.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.747
Marge, bring us home.
Big finish.

03:04.140 --> 03:13.193
♪

03:26.336 --> 03:27.511
Whoa.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.819
Whoa.
[gasps] Hey.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.168
[chuckles]:
Hey.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.735
What are you doing up so late?

03:33.778 --> 03:36.390
Uh, I'm just, uh,
watching this movie.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.827
It's an infomercial
for Flex Seal.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.046
Well, it's riveting.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.005
They're making a boat
out of rags.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.180
Could've used that
when I was trying

03:44.224 --> 03:45.747
to get out of the Philippines.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.316
Well, good night.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.839
Wait.

03:50.882 --> 03:51.927
How was your night with Andy?

03:51.970 --> 03:53.145
Great.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.712
Wait, wait.

03:54.756 --> 03:57.062
He hasn't talked to Jillfor 16 days.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.238
Did he say why?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.413
It didn't come up.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.762
You were with him all night

04:00.805 --> 04:02.720
and it didn't come up?
No.

04:02.764 --> 04:03.982
Then what the hell
did you talk about

04:04.026 --> 04:05.680
for five and a half hours?

04:05.723 --> 04:08.596
Oh, the end of the early game,
and then the whole late game.

04:08.639 --> 04:11.207
Which actually had
a successful onside kick.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.775
I mean, you just don't see it
since the rule change.

04:13.818 --> 04:16.995
Really? The only couples friendswe've ever had are in crisis,

04:17.039 --> 04:19.215
and you didn't ask him
anything about it?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.216
No.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.913
[groans] That is so men.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.046
No feelings allowed.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.917
Oh, no, there were
plenty of feelings.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.529
You have to understand,
this onside kick...

04:28.572 --> 04:31.314
If you say the words
"on," "side"

04:31.358 --> 04:33.316
or "kick" one more time,

04:33.360 --> 04:35.100
I'm going into the kitchen,
grabbing a can of soup,

04:35.144 --> 04:37.538
and throwing it at you
as hard as I can.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.540
Sorry.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.020
Just really changed the ga...

04:42.064 --> 04:44.022
Sorry.

04:44.066 --> 04:47.548
Think. Did he say
anything at all?

04:47.591 --> 04:49.680
Anything at all
that might explain

04:49.724 --> 04:51.247
how he's feeling about Jill

04:51.291 --> 04:53.597
or if anything's changed
in their relationship?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.077
He really didn't, Bonnie.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.340
The man's got a lot
on his plate right now.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.256
He's breaking in a new partner,he's trying to make sergeant,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.084
he had the Raiders plus three,

05:02.127 --> 05:04.173
which the onside kick
completely just...

05:04.216 --> 05:06.523
I'll just go get the can
of soup myself.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.399
Wait a second.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.922
Wait one damn second.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.097
Huh? What?

05:15.140 --> 05:17.229
Andy's new partner.Tell me more.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.970
What? I don't know,
she was on plainclothes,

05:19.014 --> 05:21.233
and then she spent
plainclothes..."She"?

05:21.277 --> 05:23.105
She? She?

05:23.148 --> 05:24.411
That's what I said.

05:24.454 --> 05:28.110
Well, he's been partnerswith Bert for ten years.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.285
What happened to Bert?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.765
He reunited
with his twin brother

05:30.808 --> 05:33.245
and they got picked
to do The Amazing Race.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.033
You know, there was a third one,but Bert ate him in the womb.

05:40.644 --> 05:44.126
Wow, well, Andy was blindsided.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.302
And-and, uh, you know,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.783
now he spends 12 hours a day
in a car with Joanna.

05:48.826 --> 05:49.914
The skank.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.612
Okay, ladies.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.614
I know our brains
are excellent machines

05:53.657 --> 05:55.311
for jumping to conclusions,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.748
but we don't know anythingabout this Joanna.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.098
I know her. I see her
all the time at the ER.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.100
Well, there you go.I'm sure she's very...

06:02.144 --> 06:05.321
Hold on, Marjorie, I want
to hear what Wendy has to say.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.019
You get one a year.
Make it count.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.632
Tell me everything about her.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.198
She's nice.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.985
Is that it?

06:17.028 --> 06:18.029
Kinda.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.640
Somebody get me a can of soup.

06:19.683 --> 06:20.989
I'll get it out of her.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.121
I don't know
what you want from me.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.472
She has two dogs,
Barkley and Slayton.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.083
Aw, now I feel bad
for calling her a skank.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.826
But she still is.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.916
What does she look like?

06:34.959 --> 06:36.613
Your nostrils are scaring me.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.137
Yeah. This is
getting out of hand.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.443
Calm down, Jill.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.879
You're right.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.535
Wendy, honey,

06:45.579 --> 06:47.494
what does she look like?

06:48.495 --> 06:51.062
I don't know. She's just nice.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.369
Around 40 years old.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.675
Kind of average-looking.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.460
[gasps] Before me,
average was Andy's type.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.810
Okay, okay,
you have no reason to suspect

06:59.854 --> 07:01.464
that Joanna and Andy
have anything

07:01.508 --> 07:03.684
beyond a professional
relationship.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.729
And, Jill,
you agreed to this break

07:05.773 --> 07:06.904
to give him time to think,

07:06.948 --> 07:08.732
and you have to honor
that agreement.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.343
Okay, but I made that agreement
before I knew about

07:11.387 --> 07:13.694
average Joanna
and her two damn dogs.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.696
Oh, and she also collects
vintage dolls.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.828
What, have you watched
a documentary on this woman?

07:17.872 --> 07:20.483
My kingdom for a can of soup.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.227
Steak, Tater Tots, beer and me.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.664
Your four favorite food groups.[chuckles]

07:27.708 --> 07:29.057
It all looks great.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.059
And again, my apologies.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.104
I did not know I was striking
your handsome face

07:33.148 --> 07:34.715
with the zipper side
of the pillow.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.718
Apology accepted,
but if anybody at the bar asks,

07:37.761 --> 07:40.024
I took a guy with a knife down.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.026
How's Jill doing?

07:42.070 --> 07:43.375
[sighs]
Not good.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.465
The Joanna bombshell sent her
into a tailspin,

07:45.508 --> 07:46.814
but she'll be fine.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.250
Yeah, but Jill's fine
and normal fine

07:48.293 --> 07:49.599
are not the same fine.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.906
Go on.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.169
Well, you know.
She comes with a side of drama.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.954
It's like Andy says,
she's a bit of a handful.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.438
Tell me the Tater Tot

08:02.482 --> 08:05.049
is not the most perfect form
of potato.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.922
You got the crispy outside,
you got the fluffy inside...

08:07.965 --> 08:09.271
Do you think I'm a handful?

08:12.317 --> 08:14.102
What do you mean?

08:14.145 --> 08:16.191
Is that what you say about me?

08:17.192 --> 08:18.454
I don't say that.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.456
Andy says that about Jill.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.547
What I say about you is...
other stuff.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.376
Wow.

08:27.419 --> 08:28.551
Is that a good wow?

08:28.595 --> 08:29.726
It is not.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.686
I want you to explain to me

08:32.729 --> 08:34.862
how I got in trouble
for something that Andy said.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.386
You know how.I-I really don't. I...

08:37.429 --> 08:40.781
But since you're already mad,
I'll take your Tots.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.178
Hey, I'm just calling to see
how you're doing.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.876
[quietly]:
I'm doing a lot better now.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.399
Why are you whispering?

08:50.442 --> 08:52.880
Because Andy and Joanna have
their windows rolled down

08:52.923 --> 08:55.230
and they're right in front
of me at the stop sign.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.797
So you're following them?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.146
Yep.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.540
And do they know you're there?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.019
I don't think so.

09:02.063 --> 09:05.022
I took my housekeeper's car
as a disguise.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.460
But I really wish I would've
peed before I came out here.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.681
Okay, I want you
to listen to me.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.510
This is very, very wrong.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.470
I brought binoculars,
tacos and a jar to pee in.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.781
Hey, you didn't mention
that your housekeeper's car

09:24.825 --> 09:25.956
is also a Range Rover.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.392
Yeah, I gave her my old one.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.613
I put that woman through hell.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.398
Technical question:
can you see anything?

09:33.442 --> 09:35.923
Not really. Just give me
a heads-up if they turn.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.620
[sighs]
I got a better idea.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.666
How about I introduce you
to the Bonnie Plunkett School

09:39.709 --> 09:41.145
of Surveillance Techniques.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.887
Normally a masterclass
I teach out by the airport.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.150
I'm doing great.
We're right behind 'em.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.369
Yeah. That's your first mistake.

Oh, honey, I'm not gonna say
anything like that.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.574
Breaks my heart
to see you suffering.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.229
I will talk
to the two of you later.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.884
I can't believe I blew it.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.886
This was
the best relationship I've had

19:08.930 --> 19:10.279
since my marriage ended.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.803
Mm. I remember,
and you said

19:12.847 --> 19:17.286
that you would never meet anyone
you cared about ever again.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.809
But you did.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.856
And it's gonna happen
this time, too.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.294
Hey.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.427
I didn't know I was walking
into the girls' dorm.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.692
Heh-heh-heh.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.043
Always three.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.305
What did Andy do now?

19:36.349 --> 19:38.481
If I tell you,
you'd have to pay for it.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.004
I appreciate the heads-up.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.093
Now get out.
Bad time to have a penis.
