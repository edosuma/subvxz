WEBVTT

00:08.399 --> 00:11.011
Previously onMom...So I came home,

00:11.054 --> 00:12.447
marched right
into the bathroom,

00:12.490 --> 00:14.536
told Andy I wanted
to deepen our relationship,

00:14.579 --> 00:16.407
and you know what he said?

00:16.451 --> 00:18.540
"Can I finish my shower first?"

00:19.584 --> 00:22.022
When I get home I just want
to take a shower and relax.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.198
I don't want to talk
about my feelings.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.461
Especially when I'm not
wearing pants.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.332
It's Jill. Safety first.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.292
Andy wants a break from her.

00:32.684 --> 00:35.078
Tammy, alcoholic.ALL: Hi, Tammy.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.558
Lately I've been looking
for ways to deepen

00:36.601 --> 00:37.907
my spiritual connection,

00:37.950 --> 00:41.345
so, um, I decided to takea peaceful nature hike.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.653
No phones, no earbuds,not even gum.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.134
And that's when I realized

00:47.177 --> 00:51.921
hell is other people
while also walking uphill.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.401
This couple behind me--
and I feel compelled

00:53.444 --> 00:56.099
to point out that the guy
was wearing leggings--

00:56.143 --> 00:59.407
anyway, they were going on
and on in great gory detail

00:59.450 --> 01:01.800
about this tick that had
set up shop in his...

01:01.844 --> 01:04.412
well, let's just say
his swimsuit area.

01:05.630 --> 01:09.069
She told me this
one over breakfast.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.548
I mean, how am I supposed
to achieve inner peace

01:10.592 --> 01:12.463
when I'm listening to them
yakking about hot compresses

01:12.507 --> 01:14.422
and tweezer angles and himpassed out on the kitchen table?

01:14.465 --> 01:15.771
I thought, "You know,

01:15.814 --> 01:17.164
I'll just speed up
so I don't have to hear it."

01:17.207 --> 01:18.904
But then I realized I'd neverknow how it turned out,

01:18.948 --> 01:22.125
so I pretended to drink waterto catch the end.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.518
He's fine.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.434
He just needs the leggingsto trust the woods again.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.307
Anyway, I never
connected with God,

01:30.351 --> 01:32.657
but I do know what to do
in case a tick

01:32.701 --> 01:35.747
ever sets up shop in my hoo-ha.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.099
[applause]

01:39.142 --> 01:42.058
Someone else, please.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.495
Jill, alcoholic.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.844
ALL:
Hi, Jill.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.325
Well, Andy and I
are still on pause.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.848
I guess we have
a different definition

01:49.892 --> 01:51.328
of what "pause" means.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.941
See, now, that was a pause.

01:55.985 --> 01:59.684
Oh, she was acting. I didn't
know what was happening.

01:59.728 --> 02:03.079
People, we're at day 16,
and I'm coming unglued.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.733
I'm also regretting the fact
that I let Andy be the one

02:04.776 --> 02:06.996
who gets to say, "Pause over."
[chuckles]

02:07.039 --> 02:11.522
I just wish I knew what
was going on in his head.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.220
I mean, he has told me
that sometimes I can be

02:13.263 --> 02:17.006
a bit too much, but if
loving hard and living large

02:17.049 --> 02:19.487
means I'm too much,
then guilty as charged.

02:22.490 --> 02:26.233
I just feel so helpless,
and as we all know,

02:26.276 --> 02:28.713
that is a dangerous feeling
for an alcoholic.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.892
But I mean, I-I'm not gonna
drink or use over it.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.678
I may have gone
on a bit of a shopping spree,

02:36.721 --> 02:39.724
American Express called
to make sure I was okay.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.639
They're so sweet.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.902
Anyway, thanks.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.904
[applause][clears throat]

02:45.948 --> 02:47.079
Bonnie, alcoholic.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.516
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.821
Don't worry, Jill.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.736
Adam and Andy are watching
football tonight,

02:51.780 --> 02:53.390
so I'll find out
what's going on in his head.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.957
I'm sorry,
I know that was cross talk,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.177
but she usually sits next to meand I just whisper to her

02:57.220 --> 02:59.222
while Marjorie drones on.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.747
Marge, bring us home.
Big finish.

03:04.140 --> 03:13.193
â™ª

03:26.336 --> 03:27.511
Whoa.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.819
Whoa.
[gasps] Hey.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.168
[chuckles]:
Hey.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.735
What are you doing up so late?

03:33.778 --> 03:36.390
Uh, I'm just, uh,
watching this movie.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.827
It's an infomercial
for Flex Seal.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.046
Well, it's riveting.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.005
They're making a boat
out of rags.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.180
Could've used that
when I was trying

03:44.224 --> 03:45.747
to get out of the Philippines.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.316
Well, good night.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.839
Wait.

03:50.882 --> 03:51.927
How was your night with Andy?

03:51.970 --> 03:53.145
Great.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.712
Wait, wait.

03:54.756 --> 03:57.062
He hasn't talked to Jillfor 16 days.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.238
Did he say why?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.413
It didn't come up.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.762
You were with him all night

04:00.805 --> 04:02.720
and it didn't come up?
No.

04:02.764 --> 04:03.982
Then what the hell
did you talk about

04:04.026 --> 04:05.680
for five and a half hours?

04:05.723 --> 04:08.596
Oh, the end of the early game,
and then the whole late game.

04:08.639 --> 04:11.207
Which actually had
a successful onside kick.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.775
I mean, you just don't see it
since the rule change.

04:13.818 --> 04:16.995
Really? The only couples friendswe've ever had are in crisis,

04:17.039 --> 04:19.215
and you didn't ask him
anything about it?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.216
No.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.913
[groans] That is so men.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.046
No feelings allowed.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.917
Oh, no, there were
plenty of feelings.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.529
You have to understand,
this onside kick...

04:28.572 --> 04:31.314
If you say the words
"on," "side"

04:31.358 --> 04:33.316
or "kick" one more time,

04:33.360 --> 04:35.100
I'm going into the kitchen,
grabbing a can of soup,

04:35.144 --> 04:37.538
and throwing it at you
as hard as I can.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.540
Sorry.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.020
Just really changed the ga...

04:42.064 --> 04:44.022
Sorry.

04:44.066 --> 04:47.548
Think. Did he say
anything at all?

04:47.591 --> 04:49.680
Anything at all
that might explain

04:49.724 --> 04:51.247
how he's feeling about Jill

04:51.291 --> 04:53.597
or if anything's changed
in their relationship?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.077
He really didn't, Bonnie.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.340
The man's got a lot
on his plate right now.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.256
He's breaking in a new partner,he's trying to make sergeant,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.084
he had the Raiders plus three,

05:02.127 --> 05:04.173
which the onside kick
completely just...

05:04.216 --> 05:06.523
I'll just go get the can
of soup myself.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.399
Wait a second.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.922
Wait one damn second.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.097
Huh? What?

05:15.140 --> 05:17.229
Andy's new partner.Tell me more.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.970
What? I don't know,
she was on plainclothes,

05:19.014 --> 05:21.233
and then she spent
plainclothes..."She"?

05:21.277 --> 05:23.105
She? She?

05:23.148 --> 05:24.411
That's what I said.

05:24.454 --> 05:28.110
Well, he's been partnerswith Bert for ten years.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.285
What happened to Bert?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.765
He reunited
with his twin brother

05:30.808 --> 05:33.245
and they got picked
to do The Amazing Race.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.033
You know, there was a third one,but Bert ate him in the womb.

05:40.644 --> 05:44.126
Wow, well, Andy was blindsided.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.302
And-and, uh, you know,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.783
now he spends 12 hours a day
in a car with Joanna.

05:48.826 --> 05:49.914
The skank.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.612
Okay, ladies.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.614
I know our brains
are excellent machines

05:53.657 --> 05:55.311
for jumping to conclusions,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.748
but we don't know anythingabout this Joanna.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.098
I know her. I see her
all the time at the ER.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.100
Well, there you go.I'm sure she's very...

06:02.144 --> 06:05.321
Hold on, Marjorie, I want
to hear what Wendy has to say.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.019
You get one a year.
Make it count.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.632
Tell me everything about her.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.198
She's nice.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.985
Is that it?

06:17.028 --> 06:18.029
Kinda.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.640
Somebody get me a can of soup.

06:19.683 --> 06:20.989
I'll get it out of her.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.121
I don't know
what you want from me.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.472
She has two dogs,
Barkley and Slayton.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.083
Aw, now I feel bad
for calling her a skank.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.826
But she still is.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.916
What does she look like?

06:34.959 --> 06:36.613
Your nostrils are scaring me.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.137
Yeah. This is
getting out of hand.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.443
Calm down, Jill.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.879
You're right.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.535
Wendy, honey,

06:45.579 --> 06:47.494
what does she look like?

06:48.495 --> 06:51.062
I don't know. She's just nice.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.369
Around 40 years old.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.675
Kind of average-looking.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.460
[gasps] Before me,
average was Andy's type.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.810
Okay, okay,
you have no reason to suspect

06:59.854 --> 07:01.464
that Joanna and Andy
have anything

07:01.508 --> 07:03.684
beyond a professional
relationship.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.729
And, Jill,
you agreed to this break

07:05.773 --> 07:06.904
to give him time to think,

07:06.948 --> 07:08.732
and you have to honor
that agreement.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.343
Okay, but I made that agreement
before I knew about

07:11.387 --> 07:13.694
average Joanna
and her two damn dogs.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.696
Oh, and she also collects
vintage dolls.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.828
What, have you watched
a documentary on this woman?

07:17.872 --> 07:20.483
My kingdom for a can of soup.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.227
Steak, Tater Tots, beer and me.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.664
Your four favorite food groups.[chuckles]

07:27.708 --> 07:29.057
It all looks great.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.059
And again, my apologies.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.104
I did not know I was striking
your handsome face

07:33.148 --> 07:34.715
with the zipper side
of the pillow.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.718
Apology accepted,
but if anybody at the bar asks,

07:37.761 --> 07:40.024
I took a guy with a knife down.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.026
How's Jill doing?

07:42.070 --> 07:43.375
[sighs]
Not good.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.465
The Joanna bombshell sent her
into a tailspin,

07:45.508 --> 07:46.814
but she'll be fine.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.250
Yeah, but Jill's fine
and normal fine

07:48.293 --> 07:49.599
are not the same fine.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.906
Go on.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.169
Well, you know.
She comes with a side of drama.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.954
It's like Andy says,
she's a bit of a handful.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.438
Tell me the Tater Tot

08:02.482 --> 08:05.049
is not the most perfect form
of potato.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.922
You got the crispy outside,
you got the fluffy inside...

08:07.965 --> 08:09.271
Do you think I'm a handful?

08:12.317 --> 08:14.102
What do you mean?

08:14.145 --> 08:16.191
Is that what you say about me?

08:17.192 --> 08:18.454
I don't say that.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.456
Andy says that about Jill.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.547
What I say about you is...
other stuff.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.376
Wow.

08:27.419 --> 08:28.551
Is that a good wow?

08:28.595 --> 08:29.726
It is not.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.686
I want you to explain to me

08:32.729 --> 08:34.862
how I got in trouble
for something that Andy said.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.386
You know how.I-I really don't. I...

08:37.429 --> 08:40.781
But since you're already mad,
I'll take your Tots.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.178
Hey, I'm just calling to see
how you're doing.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.876
[quietly]:
I'm doing a lot better now.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.399
Why are you whispering?

08:50.442 --> 08:52.880
Because Andy and Joanna have
their windows rolled down

08:52.923 --> 08:55.230
and they're right in front
of me at the stop sign.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.797
So you're following them?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.146
Yep.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.540
And do they know you're there?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.019
I don't think so.

09:02.063 --> 09:05.022
I took my housekeeper's car
as a disguise.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.460
But I really wish I would've
peed before I came out here.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.681
Okay, I want you
to listen to me.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.510
This is very, very wrong.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.470
I brought binoculars,
tacos and a jar to pee in.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.781
Hey, you didn't mention
that your housekeeper's car

09:24.825 --> 09:25.956
is also a Range Rover.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.392
Yeah, I gave her my old one.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.613
I put that woman through hell.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.398
Technical question:
can you see anything?

09:33.442 --> 09:35.923
Not really. Just give me
a heads-up if they turn.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.620
[sighs]
I got a better idea.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.666
How about I introduce you
to the Bonnie Plunkett School

09:39.709 --> 09:41.145
of Surveillance Techniques.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.887
Normally a masterclass
I teach out by the airport.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.150
I'm doing great.
We're right behind 'em.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.369
Yeah. That's your first mistake.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.805
You never want
to be right behind them.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.112
In fact, the best place to be
is in front of them.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.461
Well, how do I do that?

09:52.504 --> 09:53.767
And lesson one begins.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.856
All right, I'll pull over.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.205
No, you don't have to stop.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.902
Scooch your seat back,
here I come.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.730
You want to go over
or under?

10:00.774 --> 10:03.167
Well, pretty-pretty sure
I got to go over.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.604
Okay, on my mark.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.997
One, two, three.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.391
Keep your foot on the pedals.
Foot on the pedals.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.611
And... eject!

10:11.654 --> 10:14.091
Aah! Oh, my God,
that worked!

10:14.135 --> 10:15.658
[laughing]
Ooh.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.748
Yeah, I only swerved four
feet over the yellow line.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.271
Nothing from your boyfriend
up there.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.403
What kind of cops are they?

10:21.446 --> 10:24.014
The kind bonded by lust.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.668
All right, watch and learn.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.322
I'm gonna pull out
in front of them.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.760
Usually I just sketch this up
on an overhead projector,

10:30.804 --> 10:33.067
but let's see if
it actually works.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.336
Mirror! Mirror!
Right. Right.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.731
Oh, God, I can only see her.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.168
And me, looking desperate.

10:47.211 --> 10:50.562
And a little puffy
from those tacos.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.042
Nobody stalks their boyfriend

10:52.086 --> 10:53.696
'cause their life is
working out.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.961
How is it possible
I've been sober all this time,

10:58.005 --> 11:00.703
and I'm still driving around,
chasing men?

11:00.747 --> 11:03.488
Yeah, I thought sobering up
would get rid of my crazy, too,

11:03.532 --> 11:05.795
but nope, still crazy.

11:05.839 --> 11:09.625
Just a little less confused
during Fantasia.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.324
Mm. Maybe we should just stop
and go home.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.370
I'm proud of you, Jill.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.720
I knew if I came out here
and spent some time with you,

11:17.764 --> 11:19.243
you'd start to see that...

11:19.287 --> 11:20.984
Oh. They're pulling over.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.333
Quick, don't lose 'em.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.639
Uh, hang on.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.685
[tires squealing]

11:28.383 --> 11:30.428
[both panting]

11:30.472 --> 11:32.648
Wow. They didn't
notice that, either.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.954
[chuckles]
This is fun.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.042
It isfun.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.872
â™ª

11:38.915 --> 11:42.397
Two cops, two coffees,
no doughnuts. [scoffs]

11:42.440 --> 11:44.399
Another myth exploded.

11:45.922 --> 11:49.230
Is it horrible that I wish
she were drop-dead gorgeous?

11:50.927 --> 11:52.712
I mean, I can't lose him to her.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.236
Well, that's
awfully shallow, Jill.

11:55.279 --> 11:59.544
Although that mustache
isn't doing her any favors.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.373
No, wait. That's just a shadow.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.984
No, wait.

12:04.027 --> 12:06.813
Well, what the hell
is that, then?

12:06.856 --> 12:09.206
If I lose him to somebody
less pretty than me,

12:09.250 --> 12:10.599
then it means it's me.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.166
You know, my insides.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.473
And I can't Botox my insides.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.779
[sighs]
If only we could.

12:16.823 --> 12:17.737
Right?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.394
Oh, God,
now they're laughing together.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.005
And that's his real laugh,

12:25.048 --> 12:27.747
not the fake one
he takes pity on me with.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.836
Adam has one of those, too.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.576
Heh-heh-heh.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.926
Always three.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.276
Yeah, and they never
make eye contact.
Never.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.321
You know, I don't
have a fake laugh.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.975
If something's not funny,
I just don't laugh.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.498
And that's
what makes you awesome.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.805
Because you're authentic.
You are the real deal.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.549
I know I'm not supposed
to call him, but...

12:47.592 --> 12:49.769
I need to know if he's thinking
about me at all.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.687
Okay, he's picking up.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.254
He's checking caller I.D.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.342
And...

12:58.386 --> 12:59.691
he's putting it back down.

12:59.735 --> 13:00.823
[angry grunt]

13:00.867 --> 13:02.520
He sent me to voice mail.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.131
Because he's at work.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.786
They probably have a rule where
they can't take personal calls

13:06.829 --> 13:09.527
while they're having coffee
and-and-and laughing.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.400
Okay, well, then you call him.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.097
Well, technically, I think
that's a personal call...

13:14.141 --> 13:16.186
Call him.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.538
Okay.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.540
All right, he's
picking it up...

13:22.584 --> 13:24.455
he's looking at it...

13:24.499 --> 13:26.501
and he's...Hey. Andy.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.286
Wh-What isup?

13:29.330 --> 13:30.940
[nervous chuckle]

13:30.984 --> 13:32.594
That's a good question.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.598
Thanks for calling. I got to go.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.906
Oh, he picked up for you.
That says everything.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.299
But, Jill, you're on a pause
with Andy. I'm not.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.823
He probably picked up for me

13:43.866 --> 13:45.868
because he thought it was
something to do with Adam.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.478
[ringtone playing]It's him.

13:47.522 --> 13:48.958
Disguise your voice.[sighs]

13:49.002 --> 13:50.830
It's Tammy. Calm down.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.310
[sighs]:
Hi.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.660
Jill and I
are following Andy around...

13:55.704 --> 13:58.620
I brought licorice.Catch me up.
Red or black?

13:58.663 --> 14:00.491
Red. I'm not a serial killer.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.580
Oh, God, please tell me
you didn't tell Marjorie

14:02.624 --> 14:03.843
what we're doing.

14:03.886 --> 14:04.974
Mm-mm. She fell asleep
on the couch.

14:05.018 --> 14:05.975
She doesn't even know I'm here.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.672
Good, 'cause I am not up for

14:07.716 --> 14:09.065
the "Don't Stalk
Boyfriends" speech.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.676
Mm.[like Marjorie]:
Girls, part of being sober

14:11.720 --> 14:15.550
is not making choices
you're gonna have to make
an amends for down the road.

14:15.593 --> 14:19.032
[like Marjorie]:
Keep your focus
on yourself and your sobriety.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.903
[like Marjorie]: You know,
it would be nice if someone else

14:20.947 --> 14:22.862
cleaned the cat box
once in a blue moon.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.995
It's not involved with sobriety;
it's just super annoying.

14:26.039 --> 14:26.996
[all laughing]

14:27.040 --> 14:30.260
â™ª

14:30.304 --> 14:31.783
Now, this is recovery.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.047
I'm following a cop instead
of them following me.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.222
[Bonnie and Jill chuckle]

14:35.265 --> 14:37.050
Ooh, their woo-woo lights
are on!

14:37.093 --> 14:38.616
Everybody down!
We've been made!

14:38.660 --> 14:40.357
No, I think they spotted
that drunk guy

14:40.401 --> 14:41.706
stumbling out
of the bowling alley.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.839
Oh, no shirt on.
Such a giveaway.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.366
What's up with those,
Pavarotti?

14:49.410 --> 14:51.499
I swiped them from Marjorie.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.893
She uses them to keep an eye out
for the coyotes

14:53.936 --> 14:55.503
during the cats' playtime.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.942
Ooh, Joanna's strong.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.901
That's a solid half nelson.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.425
Andy very dainty with the cuffs.

15:04.468 --> 15:05.687
Yeah. Comes from a lifetime

15:05.730 --> 15:07.732
of being the biggest person
in the room.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.431
He accidentally crushed a bunny
when he was six.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.259
Oh, my God.That's so sad.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.739
I know. I've been trying
to get him into therapy.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.046
Easter's a very difficult
holiday for him.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.400
[gasps]
Andy just opened
the back door for her!

15:23.444 --> 15:26.229
Yeah, he kind of had to.She's got her hand
full of drunk guy.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.579
Drunk-gonna-vomit guy.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.146
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!

15:31.408 --> 15:33.541
Joanna's caught a little splash
on her sleeve.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.412
[gasps]
And Andy is wiping it off
for her.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.458
That is intimate behavior!

15:38.459 --> 15:39.982
I-I'm trying to think if Adam

15:40.026 --> 15:41.984
would wipe someone's vomit
off mysleeve.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.246
I guess he would.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.595
Of course he would.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.771
He's a gentleman.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.342
[clicks tongue, sighs]

15:52.386 --> 15:54.518
Aren't you glad we don't drink
like that anymore?

15:54.562 --> 15:55.998
And keep our shirts on?

15:56.042 --> 15:58.870
[chuckles softly]Yeah. We're so healthy now.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.222
â™ª

16:03.266 --> 16:05.442
Aw. Who bet theywere taking him
to the hospital?

16:05.486 --> 16:06.835
I did.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.142
Damn it, I thought jail
was a stone-cold lock.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.882
Thank you, thank you.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.059
Oop. They're
dragging him out.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.583
Marone,
shirtless puker's out cold.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.063
And he lost a sneaker.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.065
Been there. You know,
people don't understand.

16:19.108 --> 16:21.981
Every time you see a lone
sneaker in the middle of a road,

16:22.024 --> 16:23.983
there's a story.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.551
Hey, when did Joanna have time
to put on lipstick?

16:27.595 --> 16:30.119
Oh, cut her some slack--
she's got puke on her sleeve.

16:30.163 --> 16:31.991
What are you guys doing?

16:32.034 --> 16:33.122
Get in. Close the door.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.428
We're spying
on Jill's boyfriend.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.998
Dang it, I miss everything
since I took the night shift.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.782
Ooh. Licorice.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.958
Hey, what's going on
with the drunk guy?Yeah, did he hit his head?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.525
No. We got to pump
his stomach.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.048
Yeah! I win again. Pay up.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.963
And there's a warrant out
for his arrest,

16:48.007 --> 16:49.486
so he's going to jail after.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.401
Yes! Come to mama!

16:52.924 --> 16:55.492
Hey. See, now, right there,
why do they have to stand

16:55.536 --> 16:57.842
so close while they're
going over the little notepads?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.106
"He puked on you,
yes he did, done."

17:00.149 --> 17:01.977
Hey, there's this guy
in radiology,

17:02.021 --> 17:03.805
his name's Lorne,
he was in Desert Storm...

17:03.848 --> 17:06.982
Nobody cares about
Desert Storm Lorne.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.157
Joanna does.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.072
They just moved in together.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.596
What?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.598
Yeah. They found
this cute little one-bedroom

17:14.642 --> 17:16.165
in a converted firehouse.

17:16.209 --> 17:19.038
You mean to tell me we've been
following them around all night

17:19.081 --> 17:20.691
and she's got a boyfriend?

17:20.735 --> 17:22.954
This firehouse,
does it still have the pole?

17:22.998 --> 17:26.393
Oh, I always wanted a house
with a fireman's pole.

17:26.436 --> 17:29.613
Oh, you guys, Andy's
not cheating on me.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.224
He loves me.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.574
My sweet little bunny
killer loves me.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.098
[knocks on door][others gasp]

17:36.142 --> 17:38.144
Step out of the car.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.623
No, uh...

17:39.667 --> 17:41.147
just Jill.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.020
How ya been?

17:46.369 --> 17:48.067
â™ª

17:48.110 --> 17:50.286
Wendy, don't you need
to get back inside?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.767
I'm the head nurse--
I can do whatever I want.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.682
Head nurse?Since when?

17:54.725 --> 17:56.814
Last year,
right after I moved.

17:56.858 --> 17:59.426
You moved?Do you guys listen
to anything...

17:59.469 --> 18:02.255
Shh! It's getting heavy.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.952
I wish I could read lips.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.172
I can. I took a class
out by the airport.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.174
It's like a major university
out there.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.740
You can study anything.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.438
We don't need to read lips,
you guys.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.135
This is a full-on breakup.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.354
What makes you say that?

18:14.397 --> 18:16.747
He just handed her a
key and she's crying.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.140
Ooh. Here she comes.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.360
Act like we
don't know everything.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.410
What happened?How'd it go?

18:27.454 --> 18:28.716
We're just sitting here.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.763
[crying]:
Well, the pause is over.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.852
Now we're on full stop.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.593
Oh, honey.

18:36.637 --> 18:40.423
I guess it's true,
I am a bit too much.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.424
No.
No.
No.

18:41.468 --> 18:42.512
I am.

18:42.556 --> 18:43.774
[sniffles]

18:43.818 --> 18:45.776
But for the record,
so are all of you.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.429
â™ª

18:51.217 --> 18:52.261
Go ahead and say it.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.263
I should've kept
the focus on myself.

18:54.307 --> 18:57.788
Oh, honey, I'm not gonna say
anything like that.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.574
Breaks my heart
to see you suffering.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.229
I will talk
to the two of you later.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.884
I can't believe I blew it.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.886
This was
the best relationship I've had

19:08.930 --> 19:10.279
since my marriage ended.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.803
Mm. I remember,
and you said

19:12.847 --> 19:17.286
that you would never meet anyone
you cared about ever again.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.809
But you did.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.856
And it's gonna happen
this time, too.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.294
Hey.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.427
I didn't know I was walking
into the girls' dorm.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.692
Heh-heh-heh.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.043
Always three.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.305
What did Andy do now?

19:36.349 --> 19:38.481
If I tell you,
you'd have to pay for it.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.004
I appreciate the heads-up.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.093
Now get out.
Bad time to have a penis.
