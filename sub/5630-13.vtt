WEBVTT

00:07.454 --> 00:10.481
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thanks.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.227
Hit me.

00:15.229 --> 00:16.758
21.

00:16.760 --> 00:17.840
- Oh!
- Yes!

00:17.842 --> 00:19.555
Okay. Excuse me!

00:19.557 --> 00:21.802
Can I get another drink over here?

00:23.252 --> 00:25.215
This is unreal.

00:25.217 --> 00:26.363
Do you want to take it up to the room?

00:26.365 --> 00:28.194
Maybe later. I want to go out.

00:30.194 --> 00:32.356
Gentlemen. Lady.

00:32.357 --> 00:33.855
Thank you.

00:40.648 --> 00:43.510
Eight, nine, thousand.

00:43.512 --> 00:46.056
Thank you.

00:46.058 --> 00:48.138
Ma'am. You've had a nice night.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.669
I'd like to offer you a car home.

00:49.671 --> 00:52.166
Aw, that's so sweet.

00:52.168 --> 00:55.080
I'm actually okay to drive.

00:55.082 --> 00:56.462
Thanks.

01:02.156 --> 01:03.320
Hey!

01:04.819 --> 01:06.816
Where are you going?

01:06.818 --> 01:09.280
The city. I want to spend some of this.

01:09.282 --> 01:10.478
You're gonna drive?

01:10.480 --> 01:11.693
How many whiskeys did you have? Seven?

01:11.695 --> 01:13.141
Oh, now you're counting?

01:13.143 --> 01:15.439
Yeah, when I'm dealing with
a drunk, I count drinks.

01:18.354 --> 01:21.764
Find someone else that needs saving.

01:21.766 --> 01:23.962
You know what? Knock yourself out.

01:57.341 --> 01:59.503
You know why I pulled you over?

01:59.505 --> 02:01.967
I have no idea, Officer.

02:01.969 --> 02:04.081
You were swerving.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.794
Oh, um... I didn't realize that.

02:07.796 --> 02:09.657
Coming from the casino?

02:09.660 --> 02:12.972
- Yeah.
- Where's the cash?

02:13.473 --> 02:14.636
- Why?
- Look,

02:15.140 --> 02:17.232
hand it over, we can
forget the whole thing.

02:19.714 --> 02:22.409
Or I could throw you on top of the hood,

02:22.411 --> 02:24.673
throw the cuffs on you, take
you in for drunk driving.

02:25.473 --> 02:27.736
No...

02:53.360 --> 02:55.754
Drop the piece!

02:55.756 --> 02:57.819
Patrolman, drop the gun, or I drop you.

03:07.276 --> 03:09.905
Officer Watkins, huh?

03:09.907 --> 03:11.902
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

03:11.904 --> 03:13.234
And you're under arrest.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.298
Pretty sure you know
the rest of the speech.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.625
- You good?
- Yeah.

03:20.627 --> 03:22.690
I guess I was just hoping it wasn't true.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.593

03:32.346 --> 03:33.644
How many girls you rob?

03:33.646 --> 03:34.975
Were they all coming from the casino?

03:36.043 --> 03:37.273
Hmm?

03:37.275 --> 03:38.704
IAD's gonna rip you apart.

03:38.706 --> 03:39.903
It's better to confess here. Trust me.

03:39.905 --> 03:42.067
Antonio.

03:45.831 --> 03:48.026
I don't know who we
grabbed, but he ain't a cop.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.259
What are you talking about?

03:49.261 --> 03:50.557
Ran his badge number.

03:50.559 --> 03:53.454
Belongs to a Patrolman, Sam Mularz.

03:53.456 --> 03:55.317
Caucasian.

04:01.945 --> 04:03.043
Who the hell are you?

04:03.045 --> 04:06.671
I'm the guy who asked for an attorney.

04:06.673 --> 04:08.536
We'll get him ID'd.

04:08.538 --> 04:10.733
I'll get our witness down here.

04:16.927 --> 04:18.857
Watts!

04:18.858 --> 04:20.855
Shouldn't you be out chasing pickpockets?

04:20.857 --> 04:22.786
Oh, that stings. You still riding pine?

04:22.788 --> 04:25.449
Well, splinters in my ass and soft hands.

04:25.451 --> 04:26.947
Commander. Morning.

04:26.949 --> 04:27.912
Sergeant Voight around?

04:27.914 --> 04:29.611
Yeah. I'll buzz you in.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.005
You lose this fight to a fireman...

04:35.007 --> 04:37.202
I don't care if you are
doing it for charity...

04:37.204 --> 04:38.866
You find your own way home.

04:38.868 --> 04:40.231
So you'll give me a ride if I win?

04:40.233 --> 04:42.929
That's a good point. Likely not.

04:42.931 --> 04:46.158
Burgess. I heard the engagement's off.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.722
Well, your voice sure carries, Sarge.

04:48.724 --> 04:50.986
Sorry. Sucks, huh?

04:50.988 --> 04:52.850
I'm fine. I'm fine.

04:52.852 --> 04:54.148
So...

04:54.150 --> 04:55.547
Adam and I are both professionals.

04:55.549 --> 04:57.045
It'll be like it never happened.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.344
- Okay. Good.
- Yeah.

04:58.346 --> 05:00.940
'Cause I've seen those
women go into a tailspin.

05:00.942 --> 05:03.371
"I'm gonna be alone forever.
My eggs are drying up."

05:03.373 --> 05:05.635
So I am glad you're not worried.

05:05.637 --> 05:07.566
Except they do dry up.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.964
And you owe me $20.

05:09.966 --> 05:12.127
You're my rock.

05:12.129 --> 05:14.558
Squad 212.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.655
Intelligence wants you
to pick up a witness.

05:16.657 --> 05:18.653
Cool.

05:18.655 --> 05:20.484
I will... I'll meet you
in, like, one second.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.581
All right.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.812
- Could I just...
- Mm-hmm.

05:31.473 --> 05:33.602
I wanted to let you know I'm
putting a transfer order in.

05:33.604 --> 05:37.164
I filled out... I filled
out my PAR form this morning.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.062
This is exactly what I was talking about.

05:39.064 --> 05:41.459
Never, ever date a fellow cop.

05:41.461 --> 05:43.057
Yeah,

05:43.059 --> 05:44.223
well, here we are, Sarge.

05:44.225 --> 05:46.320
Burgess, if you put in a transfer order,

05:46.322 --> 05:49.483
you have no idea what
you're gonna end up with,

05:49.485 --> 05:51.148
what boss you're gonna be working for.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.212
Yeah, no, I understand that completely.

05:53.214 --> 05:56.009
If you could just sign off
on that, I'd appreciate it.

05:56.011 --> 05:58.839
Are you okay?

05:58.841 --> 06:00.603
No.

06:00.605 --> 06:01.968
Okay.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.533
Okay. You and me.

06:03.535 --> 06:05.398
We're just... we're just gonna be in here,

06:05.400 --> 06:09.260
and you are gonna feel
whatever you need to feel, okay?

06:09.262 --> 06:10.492
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:10.494 --> 06:12.522
Okay.

06:14.489 --> 06:17.550
Thank you.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.710
Kristy Bradford: hit
three sevens on the slots

06:23.712 --> 06:25.374
at the Marquise Casino last week.

06:25.376 --> 06:27.138
Pulled over by a uniformed police

06:27.140 --> 06:28.637
who demanded cash to let her go.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.134
She resisted. He did this to her.

06:31.136 --> 06:32.998
Yeah, just crushed the orbital bone

06:33.000 --> 06:35.429
with, what we assume, the butt of his gun.

06:35.431 --> 06:37.061
Broke two ribs. She's 22.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.225
Yeah, why the hell wasn't
I looped in on your sting?

06:39.227 --> 06:41.721
Internal Affairs confidential
matters brought us in.

06:41.723 --> 06:43.320
They wanted it kept inside the unit.

06:43.322 --> 06:44.785
We thought we were going after dirty cops.

06:44.787 --> 06:46.416
You thought?

06:46.418 --> 06:47.948
Well, the offender we have in custody

06:47.950 --> 06:49.912
was impersonating the police.

06:49.914 --> 06:51.610
He looked the part, but
he's not one of ours.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.941
Okay, so you two start
working together on this.

06:53.943 --> 06:56.437
Share files. Share information.

06:56.439 --> 06:58.768
Just keep this airtight
till we know what's going on.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, tell them, commander.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.031
We heard her.

07:03.831 --> 07:05.960
I got a problem with fake cops.

07:05.962 --> 07:07.857
So do you.

07:10.356 --> 07:12.785
Have a seat.

07:28.435 --> 07:30.863
We have Kristy Bradford
here to see Sergeant Voight.

07:30.865 --> 07:33.194
Of course. I'm Detective Lindsay.

07:33.196 --> 07:34.892
Would you follow me?

07:48.278 --> 07:50.907
I'm sorry. I don't see him.

07:50.909 --> 07:55.235
The man who attacked
me was... I can still...

07:55.237 --> 07:56.267
I'm sorry.

07:56.269 --> 07:58.764
Please don't apologize.

07:58.766 --> 08:00.862
I was alone, and I shouldn't have been,

08:00.864 --> 08:03.458
with all that money.

08:03.460 --> 08:06.855
But you're supposed to trust the police.

08:06.857 --> 08:10.783
He came up to the car, and
he was so friendly at first.

08:10.785 --> 08:13.480
I don't understand.

08:13.482 --> 08:16.010
If this isn't the man who attacked me,

08:16.012 --> 08:18.874
then there are more like him out there?

08:18.876 --> 08:20.039
And we're gonna find them.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.503
He has my ID.

08:22.505 --> 08:24.667
He said he'd come after
me if I came to the police.

08:24.669 --> 08:26.364
I thought that you had him.

08:33.158 --> 08:35.054
Okay,

08:35.056 --> 08:38.085
so...

08:38.087 --> 08:39.582
Gerard Garner.

08:39.583 --> 08:42.878
Where's my lawyer?

08:42.880 --> 08:44.410
First things first.

08:44.412 --> 08:46.407
No, you ain't getting no
interview without a lawyer.

08:46.409 --> 08:48.871
I'm not here to give an interview.

08:48.873 --> 08:51.202
Just an offer.

08:51.204 --> 08:53.799
It's good for 30 seconds.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.397
We know you didn't rough up our witness.

08:55.399 --> 08:57.561
This is her. Last week.

08:57.563 --> 08:59.325
That means you must be part of a crew.

08:59.327 --> 09:02.789
Another thing: I didn't
have any bullets in my gun,

09:02.791 --> 09:04.120
and I merely asked that
woman for the money.

09:04.122 --> 09:05.252
All in your favor.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.050
So, from last night's incident,

09:07.052 --> 09:08.748
since it was an undercover cop you robbed,

09:08.750 --> 09:11.878
the only real victim
is the City of Chicago.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.539
Give us the name of whoever's
behind this crew of fake cops,

09:16.541 --> 09:19.901
and you walk.

09:19.903 --> 09:20.900
Walk?

09:20.902 --> 09:22.931
As soon as we make an arrest.

09:29.292 --> 09:31.055
Six seconds.

09:31.057 --> 09:32.121
Five.

09:32.123 --> 09:33.419
Bug.

09:33.421 --> 09:34.851
That's who put me on.

09:34.853 --> 09:36.448
Yo, dude ain't right, man.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.246
This lady right here...

09:38.248 --> 09:40.411
He probably did this.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.709
He went off script.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.273
Bug's real name?

09:43.275 --> 09:44.639
Clayton Howard.

09:44.641 --> 09:46.070
He's the one in charge?

09:46.072 --> 09:48.135
As far as I know.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.399
Hey, Bug got me the badge and the car.

09:50.401 --> 09:51.530
Gave me a phone.

09:51.532 --> 09:52.630
Phone calls some dude on the floor

09:52.632 --> 09:53.928
who's watching people.

09:53.930 --> 09:55.027
Looking for winners.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.424
The phone connects to
a spotter at the casino.

09:57.426 --> 09:59.421
Right. I never met him.

09:59.423 --> 10:01.119
All right.

10:01.121 --> 10:02.984
So, who else is in this crew?

10:02.986 --> 10:04.449
I don't know.

10:04.451 --> 10:06.147
Look, I only knew Bug.

10:07.081 --> 10:08.977
Clayton "Bug" Howard.

10:08.979 --> 10:10.276
He lives in Calumet Park.

10:10.278 --> 10:11.673
He's got robbery, armed robbery,

10:11.675 --> 10:13.105
strong-arm robbery, aggravated robbery...

10:13.107 --> 10:14.936
I'll see if Kristy IDs bug.

10:14.938 --> 10:16.501
All right, loop in our guy at the casino.

10:16.503 --> 10:18.399
Anyone shady he flagged
the past two months.

10:18.401 --> 10:20.396
We need to ID the spotter.

10:24.161 --> 10:25.258
Okay.

10:25.260 --> 10:27.156
Take your time.

10:28.722 --> 10:30.917
That's him.

10:30.919 --> 10:33.681
Please tell me you've got him.

10:33.683 --> 10:36.744
We're working on it.

10:36.746 --> 10:38.342
I mean this.

10:38.344 --> 10:41.638
No pressure if you don't
want to talk about it, but...

10:41.640 --> 10:44.935
My cousin Matty said you were hot.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.300
I told him I didn't see it,

10:46.302 --> 10:49.130
to be honest.

10:49.132 --> 10:51.527
But he... he wants your number.

10:51.529 --> 10:55.355
I don't know.

10:55.357 --> 10:59.051
This is him. Clayton Howard.

10:59.053 --> 11:00.982
Although I got no idea why he matters.

11:00.984 --> 11:04.611
Someone beat us here.

11:04.613 --> 11:06.576
Mouse, did you send another
squad car as an assist?

11:06.578 --> 11:07.741
We're at Howard's house

11:07.743 --> 11:08.972
and there's another car on scene.

11:08.974 --> 11:11.869
You got the plate?

11:11.871 --> 11:13.468
Why do you need the plate off a squad?

11:13.470 --> 11:17.630
Just... what's the plate?

11:17.632 --> 11:20.659
It's Mary 84512.

11:23.358 --> 11:27.285
That vehicle was downed two
weeks ago for maintenance.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.215
What does that mean?
What are we doing here?

11:29.217 --> 11:32.612
Just drop an anchor. We're rolling to you.

11:32.614 --> 11:34.876
Always half in the dark with these guys.

11:34.878 --> 11:35.908
I don't know.

11:38.973 --> 11:40.103
They're in the house already.

11:40.105 --> 11:42.733
I don't know. Dispatch must've sent him.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.165
No, we kept it off the zone.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.662
Remember?

11:45.664 --> 11:48.327
It's a big intelligence case.

11:54.387 --> 11:57.483
Squad, 10-1, 10-1! Shots fired at police!

12:05.907 --> 12:07.304
We are southbound on Western

12:07.306 --> 12:08.602
chasing a Chicago police squad

12:08.604 --> 12:10.933
license Mary 84512.

12:10.935 --> 12:13.497
Mary 84512, copy.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.595
Step on it.

12:14.597 --> 12:16.493
- You want to drive?
- Just go faster, Roman.

12:26.650 --> 12:28.312
Come on, Roman.

12:39.401 --> 12:41.297
Roman? Roman!

12:44.895 --> 12:46.624
Who is this guy?

12:54.750 --> 12:56.346
Hold on!

13:08.101 --> 13:09.830
Roman?

13:09.832 --> 13:11.528
Roman!

13:11.530 --> 13:13.326
Yeah...

13:15.792 --> 13:17.055
2113 squad.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.918
Roll us an ambulance. My partner's injured.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.750
Offender is armed, on foot,

13:21.752 --> 13:23.880
and wanted for the attempted
murder of a policeman.

13:23.882 --> 13:25.745
Copy that, 2113. Backup on the way.

13:29.337 --> 13:31.367
We got the grid locked down. BOLO's out.

13:31.369 --> 13:32.665
Don't worry, we'll get him. All right.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.097
Thanks.

13:34.099 --> 13:36.561
Kim.

13:36.563 --> 13:37.593
- Hey.
- Are you all right?

13:37.595 --> 13:39.823
I'm fine. Roman got it worse.

13:39.825 --> 13:42.254
- They catch the guy?
- No. They're locking down a grid.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.452
Platt's on her way. I mean, why the hell

13:43.454 --> 13:44.917
didn't they tell us who we were chasing?

13:44.919 --> 13:47.082
Hey, listen.

13:47.084 --> 13:49.545
How are you doing, really?

13:49.547 --> 13:51.211
With everything?

13:51.213 --> 13:52.375
Fine. I'm fine.

13:52.377 --> 13:53.574
How are you?

13:53.576 --> 13:55.705
You're fine. Really?

13:55.707 --> 13:59.001
'Cause I'm terrible.

13:59.003 --> 14:00.333
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:00.335 --> 14:01.398
I got... yeah...

14:01.400 --> 14:04.062
I got to write on this, so...

14:06.061 --> 14:08.090
That's two squad cars in two days.

14:08.092 --> 14:09.922
Yeah.

14:09.924 --> 14:11.287
Looks like he's running hurt.

14:11.289 --> 14:13.151
Yeah. Check out the trunk.

14:16.216 --> 14:18.511
Well, that's not department issue.

14:18.513 --> 14:20.875
That blood on the barrel...
We know whose it is?

14:20.877 --> 14:22.140
No, sir. We don't.

14:22.142 --> 14:23.938
And we probably won't for a while.

14:29.734 --> 14:31.263
How you doing, Patrolman?

14:31.265 --> 14:33.959
Could've used a heads-up about who he was.

14:33.961 --> 14:35.291
Person of interest.

14:35.293 --> 14:36.689
It's always half a story with you.

14:36.691 --> 14:37.688
We almost got killed.

14:37.690 --> 14:39.053
Hey, hey, hey. Roman, back it up.

14:39.055 --> 14:42.283
Or what? I'm talking to your boss.

14:42.285 --> 14:45.845
I waved at the guy. He
emptied his mag in our car.

14:52.973 --> 14:54.702
Officer Mularz?

14:54.704 --> 14:55.868
- Hey.
- Yeah.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.166
Detective Halstead.

14:57.168 --> 14:59.562
I'm Detective Lindsay.
We're with Intelligence.

14:59.564 --> 15:02.026
We got a couple questions about your badge.

15:02.028 --> 15:04.690
That. I reported it lost two weeks ago.

15:04.692 --> 15:05.922
It's embarrassing.

15:05.924 --> 15:07.287
I got my suspension days coming.

15:07.289 --> 15:08.952
How'd you lose it?

15:08.954 --> 15:11.049
I work security at a club.

15:11.051 --> 15:12.581
Strip club.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.711
Girl comes in, wants
to see the girls dance.

15:14.713 --> 15:17.575
- Says she got a thing for cops.
- Nice.

15:17.577 --> 15:19.473
Wanted to see my badge.

15:19.475 --> 15:21.038
And I came clean with this to my sergeant.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.869
Yeah. Problem is, someone used your badge

15:22.871 --> 15:26.565
for a robbery last night.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.028
Oh, man.

15:29.030 --> 15:31.258
I hate hearing that.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.023
Every cop's worst nightmare, right?

15:33.025 --> 15:37.418
Especially when a lady almost
gets her face bashed in.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.881
15 minutes ago,

15:39.883 --> 15:41.313
another person posing as a cop

15:41.315 --> 15:43.278
opened up on two of our own,
and he's still out there.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.509
Okay, I just reached the
point where I don't know

15:44.511 --> 15:45.642
what this has to do with me.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.406
- Are you involved?
- In robbing people?

15:47.408 --> 15:48.671
That's right.

15:51.737 --> 15:53.399
I ought to lay you out
right where you stand.

15:53.401 --> 15:56.495
I'd advise against trying that.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.392
Sam? Sam, come on.

15:59.464 --> 16:00.827
You're jammed up with the department.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.759
You need money. Your badge was used.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.556
You know how easy it is to get a duplicate?

16:04.558 --> 16:06.754
Sure. But why dupe yours?

16:06.756 --> 16:08.851
I don't know. Because whoever's behind this

16:08.853 --> 16:10.715
maybe knows I got open CR numbers on me,

16:10.717 --> 16:12.214
and I'm an easy target right now.

16:12.216 --> 16:13.779
Got you standing here in
front of me, didn't it?

16:13.781 --> 16:15.410
Sam, we're not buying it.

16:15.412 --> 16:17.074
Why don't you tell us what's going on here

16:17.076 --> 16:19.172
before somebody gets killed.

16:19.174 --> 16:22.135
This thing's going south real quick.

16:22.137 --> 16:24.066
You guys want to keep talking?

16:24.068 --> 16:26.863
It's gonna be through my union rep.

16:26.865 --> 16:29.060
You all have a great day.

16:33.523 --> 16:35.386
Clayton Howard.

16:35.468 --> 16:38.562
Ran two of ours off the
road, then ditched his squad.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.959
We're sitting on his apartment,
but he knows it's burned.

16:40.961 --> 16:43.157
Investigative alert's out.
They're running a grid search.

16:43.159 --> 16:45.255
Every copper in Chicago's
got his photo right now.

16:45.257 --> 16:46.254
He'd better hid.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.685
Prints on the car being processed.

16:47.687 --> 16:50.449
It's CPD issue. Registered
to the 33rd district.

16:50.451 --> 16:52.213
The other's to the 32nd.

16:52.215 --> 16:54.410
How do you steal two squads
from two different districts?

16:54.412 --> 16:56.741
Well, how about you do me
a little favor and find out?

16:56.743 --> 16:58.772
Sergeant, that was the casino.

16:58.774 --> 17:00.470
I think they found our spotter.

17:00.472 --> 17:01.535
You two.

17:01.537 --> 17:02.601
All right.

17:05.165 --> 17:06.796
Hey, Timmons.

17:06.798 --> 17:09.326
Commander sent me over to
help out with this mess.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.758
You got a perimeter established?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.021
Yeah, we got two blocks by two blocks,

17:13.022 --> 17:15.486
and every available
copper's going yard to yard.

17:15.488 --> 17:17.349
With your permission,
let's go four by four.

17:17.352 --> 17:19.248
I'll make a call. We'll
get twice the units.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.311
Yeah. Let's do it.

17:23.045 --> 17:25.074
Hey, sergeant, looks like
you got plenty of bodies.

17:25.076 --> 17:27.138
I'm thinking we can get
back in the car today.

17:27.141 --> 17:28.270
What... are you out of your mind?

17:28.271 --> 17:29.769
The guy took a swing at police.

17:29.771 --> 17:32.066
It's an Intelligence case.
I'm sure they're on it.

17:32.068 --> 17:33.597
Or not. We'll never know.

17:33.599 --> 17:36.793
Oh, good, 'cause I was really
wondering what your opinion was.

17:36.795 --> 17:38.158
You're gonna do this search.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.589
Report to 103rd Street. Right now.

17:44.487 --> 17:46.649
So, it's, like, over over?

17:46.651 --> 17:48.547
I don't know. You're gonna have to ask her.

17:48.549 --> 17:50.511
She gave the ring back.

17:50.513 --> 17:51.810
Anyway, moving on, right?

17:51.812 --> 17:52.974
Yeah.

17:52.976 --> 17:55.039
Your guy. He came back.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.271
How long was he here?

17:56.273 --> 17:58.735
About two hours. Sitting at table seven.

17:58.737 --> 18:01.465
Watching people play.
Sending text messages.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.463
Yeah? You get his phone?

18:02.465 --> 18:03.796
Yeah, we took his phone.

18:03.798 --> 18:05.460
He get any calls?

18:05.462 --> 18:07.391
Not since we detained him.

18:16.782 --> 18:19.743
Ah. What's up, gentlemen?

18:19.745 --> 18:22.306
Agh... what happened here?

18:22.308 --> 18:25.170
He ran. Fell down the stairs.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.266
Hmm. Give us a minute with him, would you?

18:28.268 --> 18:30.231
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

18:35.626 --> 18:37.256
- So?
- Look, guys,

18:37.258 --> 18:39.320
it's like I told them already, okay?

18:39.322 --> 18:41.651
I'm a card counter. I'm not a spotter.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.914
Come on, that's all I do. That's it.

18:43.976 --> 18:46.671
There's no way I'm involved
with any of these robberies.

18:46.673 --> 18:48.935
Okay, well, I guess you're their problem.

18:48.937 --> 18:51.199
Wait, wait. Guys, hold up. Wait.

18:51.201 --> 18:54.295
I mean, what if I can help you out?

18:54.297 --> 18:55.660
Yeah?

18:55.662 --> 18:57.591
I mean, I know you're looking
for someone down there.

18:57.593 --> 19:00.022
A shady guy, watching
all the action, right?

19:00.024 --> 19:03.018
That's who you're looking for, right?

19:03.020 --> 19:04.450
Show us.

19:04.452 --> 19:06.981
Well, he's not here today.

19:06.983 --> 19:08.446
Okay.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.776
Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:10.778 --> 19:12.840
You bring a video from yesterday,

19:12.842 --> 19:14.406
and I can show him to you, okay?

19:14.408 --> 19:16.969
I will point him out.

19:16.971 --> 19:19.732
Yesterday. 5:00 p.m.

19:21.499 --> 19:23.861
Table seven. Big guy.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.424
High school football
ring on his right hand.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.522
What? I'm observant.

19:28.524 --> 19:30.220
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

19:30.222 --> 19:32.284
All right, we're gonna need a screen shot.

19:33.884 --> 19:36.479
So I ran the spotter
through Faces of the Nation.

19:36.481 --> 19:38.876
Now, what came back is Franklin Haynes.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.508
He did two stints for armed robbery.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.039
LKA puts him in Bucktown.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.269
Known associates?

19:44.271 --> 19:47.166
Well, none other than
Mr. Clayton "Bug" Howard.

19:49.432 --> 19:51.928
Franklin Haynes! Chicago PD!

20:02.517 --> 20:04.579
Clear.

20:22.190 --> 20:23.954
Here lies Franklin Haynes.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.151
Everything he knew about
this crew died with him.

20:26.153 --> 20:27.849
Yeah, we're still
waiting on the ballistics,

20:27.851 --> 20:30.079
but the blood on Howard's
shotgun is a match for Haynes.

20:30.081 --> 20:31.711
They're cleaning house.
Whoever runs this crew

20:31.713 --> 20:32.710
knows we're closing in.

20:32.712 --> 20:34.841
- Officer Mularz?
- Lawyered up.

20:34.843 --> 20:35.906
We're going through those channels

20:35.908 --> 20:37.071
to set up another interview.

20:37.073 --> 20:39.235
You got nothing to connect
him to the other guys?

20:39.237 --> 20:40.468
Not yet.

20:40.470 --> 20:42.365
But you like him.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.130
- We do.
- Hmm.

20:44.132 --> 20:47.326
All right, where are we at locating Howard?

20:50.690 --> 20:52.519
Ruzek?

20:52.521 --> 20:54.817
Oh, we're still searching.

20:54.819 --> 20:56.815
Must've found a good
hiding spot within the grid.

20:56.817 --> 20:59.812
The GPS units that were in the
stolen squads... they're gone.

20:59.814 --> 21:00.943
And that's not easy to do.

21:00.945 --> 21:02.109
It's like a Russian doll down there.

21:02.111 --> 21:03.207
It's a box inside a box...

21:03.209 --> 21:04.239
Inside a box.

21:04.241 --> 21:05.771
So we got nothing off the cars?

21:05.773 --> 21:08.368
They were from two different districts,

21:08.370 --> 21:10.699
but both squads were sent
to the same motor pond

21:10.701 --> 21:12.329
in Area South a month ago.

21:12.331 --> 21:14.327
It could be Clayton Howard's got a hookup

21:14.329 --> 21:16.025
inside the motor pool.

21:16.027 --> 21:17.357
You two.

21:20.289 --> 21:23.417
Hey, you got your head on straight?

21:23.419 --> 21:25.114
Yeah, it's just...

21:25.116 --> 21:26.780
I'll be honest. I didn't see it coming.

21:26.782 --> 21:27.944
You know? I feel like I let her down.

21:27.946 --> 21:31.274
That's not what I asked.

21:31.276 --> 21:33.438
Yes, sir. My head's on straight.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.003
Okay.

21:36.836 --> 21:39.731
Sergeant. Lawrence is clear.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.028
You checked backyards, under cars?

21:42.030 --> 21:43.992
There's a trailer behind
one house, but no one's home.

21:43.994 --> 21:44.991
It's locked up.

21:44.993 --> 21:46.523
Then Lawrence is not clear.

21:46.525 --> 21:47.655
Well, what am I supposed to do?

21:47.657 --> 21:50.418
Crack open someone's private property?

21:54.415 --> 21:56.544
Hey. Hey, you need to calm down.

21:56.546 --> 21:58.010
You're still alive, right?

21:58.012 --> 21:59.973
I'm not worried about
what could've happen to me.

21:59.975 --> 22:02.204
I'm worried about you.

22:05.036 --> 22:06.266
You the shift supervisor?

22:06.268 --> 22:08.064
I am. You got a problem with your vehicle?

22:08.066 --> 22:09.529
Two of them, actually. We were wondering

22:09.531 --> 22:11.260
if you can tell us where
we can find these cars.

22:11.262 --> 22:13.424
Give me a second.

22:17.089 --> 22:18.119
You want a french fry?

22:18.121 --> 22:19.917
No, thanks.

22:21.617 --> 22:23.213
Maybe.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.375
The cars were stolen off your lot.

22:27.377 --> 22:28.373
Nope.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.670
They were signed out, Detective.

22:30.672 --> 22:32.535
- Show me.
- Right there.

22:32.537 --> 22:34.999
Officer Sam Mularz. I remember her.

22:35.001 --> 22:36.331
Her?

22:36.333 --> 22:37.562
Yeah. Yeah, she's real pretty.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.326
Came in with her partner.
Big guy. Black guy.

22:40.328 --> 22:42.257
He signed out a car two weeks before that.

22:42.259 --> 22:44.853
That's not her name. That's a stolen badge.

22:44.855 --> 22:47.118
Black officer... is this him?

22:47.120 --> 22:49.082
Yep. One and the same.

22:49.084 --> 22:50.214
Do you have cameras in here?

22:50.216 --> 22:52.445
We need anything you got on the partner.

22:54.245 --> 22:55.775
I got a match on the female partner,

22:55.777 --> 22:57.838
on one Elizabeth McKenney.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.938
She's got priors.

22:58.940 --> 23:00.602
Shoplifting and resisting arrest.

23:00.604 --> 23:02.899
You got an address?

23:02.901 --> 23:05.430
Right there. Off Western.

23:05.432 --> 23:07.826
Send Burgess and Roman? Or is he still...

23:07.828 --> 23:09.358
benched until his feelings get unhurt?

23:09.360 --> 23:11.988
No, he's fine. Send him.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.287
Okay.

23:16.386 --> 23:18.081
Ms. McKenney?

23:18.083 --> 23:20.013
If this is about the
stereo, I turned it down.

23:20.015 --> 23:23.142
Bitch is crazy, and you
can tell her I said that.

23:23.144 --> 23:25.373
It's not. Can we come in?

23:25.375 --> 23:28.136
Ah, it's so messy in here right now.

23:28.138 --> 23:30.001
I'd be embarrassed.

23:30.003 --> 23:31.399
Clayton Howard!

23:40.323 --> 23:42.219
Stay down!

23:44.119 --> 23:45.382
Stop! Police!

23:45.384 --> 23:47.247
2113, I'm a 10-99 unit

23:47.249 --> 23:48.546
requesting immediate backup.

23:48.548 --> 23:51.975
Offender entered a
building on 119th and Union.

23:51.977 --> 23:53.206
I'm in pursuit.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.371
Copy, 2113. Backup on the way.

23:55.373 --> 23:58.634
119th and Union.

24:44.548 --> 24:47.210
Ugh! Ah!

24:49.309 --> 24:50.505
Roman!

24:59.897 --> 25:00.927
You okay?

25:00.929 --> 25:01.992
Yeah.

25:24.827 --> 25:27.156
You like beating up women, Bug?

25:28.656 --> 25:31.551
Girl you put in the hospital last week...

25:31.553 --> 25:32.983
She seems to think you do.

25:32.985 --> 25:34.447
Thought you enjoyed it.

25:36.081 --> 25:38.343
She should've gave it up.

25:39.610 --> 25:42.404
Blood on the shotgun we
found in your stolen squad

25:42.406 --> 25:44.802
is a match for Franklin Haynes.

25:44.804 --> 25:47.133
Sounds like you know everything.

25:47.135 --> 25:50.628
I don't.

25:50.630 --> 25:53.425
Cars...

25:53.427 --> 25:56.987
the badges...

25:56.989 --> 25:58.818
Where'd you get them?

25:58.820 --> 26:00.051
You don't know that part?

26:00.053 --> 26:03.346
That's the best part.

26:03.348 --> 26:05.844
Maybe I'll enjoy it as much as you.

26:08.975 --> 26:12.236
Where'd you get them?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.899
Oh, my God. This is great.

26:19.330 --> 26:22.424
Let me tell you something.

26:22.426 --> 26:26.885
That uniform you put
on? I take it seriously.

26:26.887 --> 26:29.981
My father... he wore that uniform.

26:29.983 --> 26:33.777
Men I know died in that
uniform protecting this city.

26:33.779 --> 26:36.507
All the times I been pulled over by cops,

26:36.509 --> 26:39.072
frisked by cops,

26:39.074 --> 26:42.833
shoved down on the
sidewalk face-first by cops,

26:42.835 --> 26:44.764
lied to by cops,

26:44.766 --> 26:47.394
knocked around by cops,

26:47.396 --> 26:51.257
ripped off...

26:51.259 --> 26:53.354
by cops...

26:53.356 --> 26:55.352
all those times.

26:55.354 --> 26:58.381
Too many to count.

26:58.383 --> 27:01.878
It gives me great pleasure to serve one up.

27:04.809 --> 27:06.638
Who?

27:08.872 --> 27:10.867
I want a deal first.

27:10.869 --> 27:12.831
Takes a name to get a deal.

27:12.833 --> 27:15.295
Otherwise you're just shaking your ass.

27:18.793 --> 27:21.155
Detective Martin Watts.

27:21.157 --> 27:24.617
Works in robbery, burglary.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.011
Oh!

27:30.013 --> 27:32.042
The look on your face just
made that so much better for me.

27:32.044 --> 27:35.438
Watts gave you the badge and the cars?

27:35.440 --> 27:38.102
He gave me the blueprint.

27:38.104 --> 27:41.031
The badge and the cars
was just the first step.

27:41.033 --> 27:44.727
The whole thing was his idea.

27:47.891 --> 27:51.685
Watts arrested both Howard
and Haynes on burglary charges.

27:51.687 --> 27:53.650
Instead of pushing their
cases, he put them to work.

27:53.652 --> 27:55.082
And our first offender?

27:55.084 --> 27:57.478
No, they don't look connected.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.309
Watts turned out Howard,

27:59.311 --> 28:01.008
and then he must've brought in his friend.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.206
Watts was the catching detective

28:02.208 --> 28:03.405
for anything out of the casino.

28:03.407 --> 28:04.869
He could've buried anything he wanted.

28:04.871 --> 28:08.466
We can't stitch up a cop on
a tip from a repeat offender.

28:08.468 --> 28:10.064
You think I want to go after one of ours?

28:10.066 --> 28:11.495
I mean, girls got robbed and beaten.

28:11.497 --> 28:13.360
We don't know how many. We
don't know who else got hurt,

28:13.362 --> 28:16.190
because the guy in charge
was investigating himself.

28:22.185 --> 28:24.280
We got to play this really carefully.

28:26.680 --> 28:30.806
Antonio, you got eyes on Watts' vehicle?

28:30.808 --> 28:32.404
Negative.

28:32.406 --> 28:34.235
Mouse, any movement on his phone?

28:34.237 --> 28:35.733
Last ping was inside the house.

28:35.735 --> 28:36.998
He hasn't moved in over an hour.

28:39.531 --> 28:41.093
Sarge, you got movement upstairs.

28:43.859 --> 28:45.089
Chicago PD!

28:52.082 --> 28:53.812
- Clear.
- Clear.

28:53.814 --> 28:56.476
Watts, if you're up there,

28:56.478 --> 28:58.806
come on down, now, nice and slow.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.934
It's just me. I'm coming down.

29:08.397 --> 29:09.660
What the hell's going on?

29:12.892 --> 29:16.052
He came home and he was looking for Jenni.

29:16.054 --> 29:17.251
Jenni is...

29:17.253 --> 29:18.816
Our daughter.

29:18.818 --> 29:21.347
She's out with friends.

29:21.349 --> 29:23.577
But he said he had an active case,

29:23.579 --> 29:26.007
and he took his gun.

29:26.009 --> 29:27.139
His shotgun.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.403
Oh, my God.

29:29.405 --> 29:30.869
- Sarge?
- Yeah.

29:30.871 --> 29:32.932
It's not about money now.

29:32.934 --> 29:34.031
I found this stash.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.028
It was hidden in a panel in the bedroom.

29:36.030 --> 29:38.626
All right, he knows we're closing in.

29:38.628 --> 29:40.790
Please.

29:40.792 --> 29:43.687
Whatever's going on...

29:43.689 --> 29:48.114
He's a good man.

29:48.116 --> 29:49.546
Do you know where he'd go?

29:53.277 --> 29:56.005
Martin Watts, he's one of ours.

29:56.007 --> 29:57.937
Suspected of armed robbery, battery,

29:57.939 --> 29:59.202
and first degree murder.

29:59.204 --> 30:01.898
Been on the job 20 years.
He's armed and trained,

30:01.900 --> 30:03.763
and he's not gonna be happy to see us.

30:03.765 --> 30:06.526
We believe he's barricaded
in one of those RVs.

30:06.528 --> 30:08.357
We sealed off a one-block perimeter.

30:08.359 --> 30:10.322
No one comes in or out until he's in cuffs.

30:10.324 --> 30:12.852
All right, SORT, you hang
back until I give the signal.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.817
There's no need to spook him.

30:14.819 --> 30:17.413
IAD, you're here to observe.

30:17.415 --> 30:20.243
He's all yours once we got him.

30:20.245 --> 30:23.140
All right, I know this isn't easy.

30:23.142 --> 30:25.637
But if he makes a move,

30:25.639 --> 30:27.834
don't hesitate.

30:27.836 --> 30:29.932
Let's do it.

30:31.832 --> 30:33.728
Hank?

30:33.730 --> 30:37.290
Me and Watts worked the
same district for 11 years.

30:37.292 --> 30:40.852
I know him better than any
negotiator HQ's gonna send.

30:40.854 --> 30:43.216
So let me bring him in.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.748
Let me do this.

30:51.908 --> 30:54.669
If it puts you in danger, Trudy...

30:54.671 --> 30:56.733
Understood.

31:01.296 --> 31:04.258
Hey, Watts! It's Trudy.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.256
Are you alone in there?

31:06.258 --> 31:08.487
I'm alone and I'm armed.

31:08.489 --> 31:10.950
Okay, well,

31:10.952 --> 31:12.715
you're making everybody
a little tense out here,

31:12.717 --> 31:16.443
so why don't you come on out,
and we'll all relax, okay?

31:16.445 --> 31:18.508
You need to back up!

31:20.208 --> 31:22.636
I can't do that, Watts.

31:22.638 --> 31:24.934
I'm coming in.

31:24.936 --> 31:26.132
I'm coming in now.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.297
It's just me.

31:28.299 --> 31:29.295
Coming in.

31:29.297 --> 31:30.860
Okay.

31:50.764 --> 31:51.961
Put down your weapon.

31:51.963 --> 31:52.994
Put it down!

31:52.996 --> 31:55.024
Putting it down. Putting it down.

31:57.723 --> 32:00.651
Okay, I'm just...

32:12.039 --> 32:14.901
I don't know what your goal is,

32:14.903 --> 32:18.231
but no way am I walking out of here.

32:18.233 --> 32:20.428
Either I take care of
this, or one of yours does.

32:26.256 --> 32:28.285
How did we get here?

32:36.311 --> 32:39.405
You remember I got shot?

32:39.407 --> 32:41.536
The bullet lodged in my spine.

32:41.538 --> 32:43.867
They put me on medical.

32:43.869 --> 32:46.630
I'm making half a city wage
trying to remember how to walk.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.194
I get back on the job and
I'm right back to it...

32:49.196 --> 32:53.089
chasing dirtbags in foreign cars

32:53.091 --> 32:56.085
who pull down my salary in a night.

32:56.087 --> 32:58.715
I was... I was owed more.

33:01.474 --> 33:03.869
Watts?

33:03.871 --> 33:07.365
Martin?

33:07.367 --> 33:10.595
Everybody gets hurt.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.160
I got shot, too.

33:12.162 --> 33:13.658
- Remember?
- Yeah.

33:13.660 --> 33:14.890
And the brass gave me a desk

33:14.892 --> 33:16.654
and they made it very clear

33:16.656 --> 33:19.451
that that was my one and only choice.

33:19.453 --> 33:22.448
And all I wanted to do was be out there.

33:24.414 --> 33:26.510
Can I please have a drink?

33:38.630 --> 33:41.824
But now,

33:41.826 --> 33:45.388
I got a whole building to protect.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.219
And that was my reward,

33:47.221 --> 33:49.183
because I didn't let it break me.

33:52.548 --> 33:56.141
It... it doesn't happen all at once.

33:56.143 --> 33:59.604
It's inch by inch,

33:59.606 --> 34:01.701
until one day, you're
alone with a bag of money,

34:01.703 --> 34:05.464
and you just... you reach in,

34:05.466 --> 34:07.894
and you're just so far
from where you started.

34:11.824 --> 34:14.520
There's no way back.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.483
Okay, okay.

34:17.485 --> 34:21.311
Just breathe, okay?

34:21.313 --> 34:23.574
It was my plan,

34:23.577 --> 34:25.040
but at the end, I worked for them.

34:25.042 --> 34:28.469
I tried to shut it down.

34:28.472 --> 34:30.235
But... but Howard...
he just came back at me.

34:30.237 --> 34:33.197
He said he wanted two cars.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.994
He tried to cover our tracks.

34:39.326 --> 34:41.222
A man's dead.

34:47.549 --> 34:50.844
I didn't pull the
trigger, but that's on me.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.338
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:55.340 --> 34:57.769
Virginia and your daughter...
They do not deserve this.

34:57.771 --> 35:00.698
You cannot do this to your daughter.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.496
You cannot.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.323
Martin.

35:27.136 --> 35:30.463
You... you drank all my booze. I need...

35:30.465 --> 35:33.094
Could you get another
bottle? It's in the...

35:33.096 --> 35:34.725
the cupboard.

35:34.727 --> 35:36.756
- Heck yeah.
- Okay.

35:58.699 --> 36:02.126
But I'm gonna need your ankle piece first.

36:41.182 --> 36:42.279
I'm sorry.

36:42.281 --> 36:44.576
Come on, before the cameras get here.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.122
Always check the ankle piece.

37:02.389 --> 37:03.917
What was his name?

37:03.989 --> 37:05.419
From the academy?

37:05.421 --> 37:06.818
Hammered that into us.

37:06.820 --> 37:08.316
I still feel him standing over me.

37:08.318 --> 37:09.681
Officer Llewyn.

37:09.683 --> 37:11.046
- Llewyn.
- Mm.

37:11.048 --> 37:13.210
Stood too close to the females.

37:13.212 --> 37:15.041
Hmm.

37:15.043 --> 37:18.237
That whole time, all I could think was,

37:18.239 --> 37:21.268
that could be any of us
sitting in that chair.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.529
How easy mistakes pile on each other.

37:27.355 --> 37:28.730
Sergeant?

37:28.729 --> 37:29.951
You wanted to see me?

37:29.957 --> 37:32.722
Yeah. How you feeling?

37:32.717 --> 37:35.577
Fine.

37:35.584 --> 37:38.344
When I asked you to sit on that house,

37:38.342 --> 37:41.843
I thought it was one thing...
Turned out it was another.

37:41.852 --> 37:45.868
And I didn't intend to
put you in a bad situation.

37:45.874 --> 37:48.805
And I apologize.

37:48.804 --> 37:50.899
That it?

37:50.901 --> 37:52.663
That's it.

37:55.230 --> 37:57.492
So, a real cop was behind this?

37:57.494 --> 37:59.089
Well,

37:59.091 --> 38:01.154
he hadn't been a real cop for a long time.

38:13.575 --> 38:14.938
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:14.940 --> 38:16.968
- I...
- Yeah, sorry.

38:18.235 --> 38:20.264
Certainly earned your paycheck today, huh?

38:20.266 --> 38:22.129
- I'll say.
- You all right?

38:22.131 --> 38:23.927
Yeah, I'm good.

38:23.929 --> 38:24.959
Yeah?

38:24.961 --> 38:27.789
Yeah. Uh...

38:27.790 --> 38:28.787
Anyway, I'll see you.

38:28.789 --> 38:31.884
Kim?

38:31.886 --> 38:34.314
You know, Sergeant Platt
and I are pretty close.

38:34.316 --> 38:35.380
She's...

38:35.382 --> 38:37.011
She loves you.

38:37.013 --> 38:39.375
Yeah, we'll call it a
mutual admiration society.

38:39.377 --> 38:41.306
Okay.

38:41.308 --> 38:42.439
She and I were talking,

38:42.441 --> 38:45.169
and... I don't have to be coy here.

38:45.171 --> 38:48.265
She told me that you're transferring out.

38:48.267 --> 38:50.229
Yeah, that's right.

38:50.231 --> 38:53.725
Because it's that difficult
to see him at work every day?

38:53.727 --> 38:55.556
Because...

38:58.388 --> 39:01.782
Because I feel really
guilty about calling it off.

39:01.784 --> 39:03.081
But it needed to be called off.

39:03.083 --> 39:06.677
So... there's plenty of
other places I can work, Erin.

39:06.679 --> 39:09.373
Yeah, no, I hear you.

39:09.375 --> 39:12.569
But you know that when Platt
signs off on that paperwork

39:12.571 --> 39:15.000
and takes it to the commander,
she's gonna want to know why.

39:18.165 --> 39:21.625
You know how hard it is
already to be a female cop.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.889
And this will follow you around.

39:23.891 --> 39:26.653
You. Not him.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.617
For the rest of your career.

39:31.682 --> 39:35.675
And I'm telling you, you have a
really bright one ahead of you.

39:37.974 --> 39:39.870
Just think about it.

39:40.804 --> 39:43.566
Yeah.

39:47.197 --> 39:49.260
I'm really sorry.

39:51.059 --> 39:52.090
I got to go.

39:52.092 --> 39:54.153
Yeah.

39:57.985 --> 40:00.113
All right. Two Bison Tail Porters.

40:00.115 --> 40:01.745
They're my favorite new craft brewery.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.110
They sent over two free cases.

40:03.112 --> 40:04.141
It's kind of bitter, though, right?

40:04.143 --> 40:05.140
Mm.

40:05.142 --> 40:06.639
- What up?
- Tony!

40:06.641 --> 40:09.135
Hey, heard your middleweight
got injured today.

40:09.137 --> 40:11.499
You're gonna have to forfeit, huh?

40:11.501 --> 40:13.797
Actually, I was thinking
I might offer my services.

40:13.799 --> 40:14.963
No. No, no way.

40:14.965 --> 40:16.727
Why not? I trained for this.

40:16.729 --> 40:20.956
You trained for Roman.

40:20.958 --> 40:23.485
Right. I'm looking at
you out of peer pressure,

40:23.487 --> 40:24.851
just to be clear.

40:24.853 --> 40:26.316
- Screw it. I'm in.
- Ohh.

40:26.318 --> 40:27.781
- Let's box.
- There, you all heard it.

40:27.783 --> 40:28.780
That was binding.

40:28.782 --> 40:30.611
Okay.

40:30.613 --> 40:33.141
You're gonna be needing this.

40:36.372 --> 40:38.268
Hey, Adam. This is Bryn.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.233
And I was just telling Bryn

40:40.235 --> 40:43.429
that you're kind of licking
your wounds a little bit.

40:43.431 --> 40:44.627
Well, it turns out that so is she.

40:44.629 --> 40:46.258
So, you know.

40:46.260 --> 40:47.324
Cheers.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.119
So, you're a cop?

40:52.121 --> 40:53.217
I am.

40:53.219 --> 40:56.647
Wow, you must have so many crazy stories.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.776
I got some crazy stories.

41:04.572 --> 41:08.666
Look, Bryn...

41:08.668 --> 41:10.497
I'm just not...

41:10.499 --> 41:12.128
No problem.

41:12.130 --> 41:14.093
Sorry.
