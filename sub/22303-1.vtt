Whoo!

41:15.573 --> 41:17.507
(man) It's already
worse than I imagined.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.310
(man)
Pretty sure I just saw a cougar

41:20.411 --> 41:23.613
about ten feet
from my front door.

41:23.681 --> 41:24.747
I hear something out there.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.850
[bear growls]

41:26.951 --> 41:29.986
You see things here that you
wouldn't see anywhere else.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.588
(man) I didn't come
here to get killed.

41:31.689 --> 41:32.822
[bleep].

41:32.923 --> 41:34.924
(man) This is so hard
doing this alone.

41:35.025 --> 41:38.161
You reach a point where
you just don't care anymore.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.129
(man) I will not spend
another night in there.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.233
I'm not enjoying myself,
that's for sure.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.134
(man)
What am I doing out here?

41:46.305 --> 41:52.781
