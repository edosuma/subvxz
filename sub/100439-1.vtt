00:08.258 --> 00:10.677
What is Mythic Quest?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.307
Some may say it's just a video game.

00:18.393 --> 00:23.106
When it first debuted,
MQ was hailed as a masterpiece.

00:23.690 --> 00:27.027
Now played in 20 different countries
on six continents,

00:27.110 --> 00:32.783
it's the biggest massive
multiplayer role-playing game of all time.

00:32.866 --> 00:37.079
But in such a fickle industry
where fortunes can turn

00:37.663 --> 00:39.581
and titans fall...

00:41.041 --> 00:42.793
they must stay relevant.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.839
And today,
they find themselves on the precipice

00:46.922 --> 00:49.967
of their most important event
since launch.

00:50.592 --> 00:56.056
Their first major expansion,
Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.853
And it all falls on the shoulders
of one man.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.438
Creative Director Ian Grimm.

01:03.522 --> 01:08.485
When I first created MQ,
my intention wasn't to just build a game.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.737
I wanted to build a world.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.533
And Raven's Banquet is
the next step into that world.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.119
Of course,
one person cannot do this alone.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.206
It takes thousands of people
to keep a world like this up and running.

01:21.832 --> 01:25.169
People like
Executive Producer David Brittlesbee...

01:26.211 --> 01:27.921
Lead Engineer Poppy Li.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.426
People like Brad Bakshi,
Head of Monetization.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.263
One thing MQ has
that no other game can boast

01:36.346 --> 01:41.185
is a Nebula Award-winning writer,
C.W. Longbottom.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.311
At your service.

01:42.394 --> 01:46.899
But it all eventually must funnel through
the vision of its creator.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.859
And he dreams big.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.361
When we think about cultural touchstones,

01:51.904 --> 01:55.073
we think ET, Star Wars, Avatar,

01:55.490 --> 01:59.828
and yet our industry dwarfs
the traditional entertainment business.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.289
So when we think about legends...

02:03.290 --> 02:05.959
why not think, Mythic Quest?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.252
True, indeed.

02:07.336 --> 02:10.672
And when we think of visionary,
world-building artists,

02:10.756 --> 02:14.551
instead of just Spielberg,
Lucas, and Cameron,

02:14.635 --> 02:16.553
why not think...

02:18.180 --> 02:19.348
Grimm?

02:23.101 --> 02:25.771
I'm sorry, I gotta stop. What is this?

02:26.730 --> 02:29.274
-It's a commercial for the game.
-It's a commercial for you.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.442
It's still going.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.908
Oh, my God.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.453
I think it's brilliant.

02:57.177 --> 03:01.932
One new continent,
over a thousand new playable items,

03:02.015 --> 03:06.186
all built on the most robust code base
in the history of MMOs.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.438
I don't mean to toot my own horn here,

03:08.522 --> 03:12.317
but my team and I have built
something remarkable, so...

03:13.652 --> 03:15.612
Raven's Banquet is ready to launch!

03:15.696 --> 03:18.532
-All right! Incredible.
-Thank you.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.828
Absolutely stunning, Poppy.
This expansion is going to blow them away.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.747
But are we sure that we're finished?

03:25.831 --> 03:28.250
I think it's finished. We've been on it
for two years. It's perfect.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.920
No, it's like we're almost there,
we're almost perfect.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.505
-Where did you get that?
-I have my own.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.757
Nobody remembers "almost perfect,"
do they?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.926
It's like-- This.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.469
Okay, now what's this, Pop?

03:39.970 --> 03:40.971
That's a shovel.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.641
It's just a little MTX item
I designed for myself.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.435
The whole game's your vision.
I thought that the--

03:46.518 --> 03:48.395
Right,
it's just that something's off about it.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.439
Right? Like it's not entirely...

03:51.940 --> 03:53.150
cool.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.569
"Cool"? "Cool."

03:55.652 --> 03:57.821
No, it is cool though,

03:57.905 --> 04:00.949
because it provides
an entirely new game mechanic: digging.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.953
The players can now literally
change the landscape of the game.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.707
-Pop, no one's gonna buy that.
-If I may?

04:08.790 --> 04:11.502
Maybe the shovel needs a backstory.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.671
Who birthed this mysterious terra-spade?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.589
The gods themselves?

04:16.673 --> 04:21.470
Did they suckle at the bosom of Hera
like babes at their mother's teat?

04:22.137 --> 04:24.640
-That's pretty good.
-Yeah, teats I can sell. Let's do that.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.100
Let's not. Let's not do teats.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.270
Accounting's on three, Marketing's on two,

04:30.354 --> 04:32.105
Tech Support's on six,

04:32.189 --> 04:35.400
and this...
this is where the magic happens.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.530
All the dev team heads are here
and, well, I oversee it all.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.615
Whoa. Is that your office?

04:42.616 --> 04:45.536
No. No, it's not. That's Ian's.
He's creative director.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.704
Why's it so much higher
than everyone else's?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.499
No, it's not that much higher.
It's an architectural anomaly, that's all.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.919
And the most powerful person doesn't
always have the biggest office, Jo.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.505
In fact, I'm not the most powerful person
at this company.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.508
This whole studio is owned by
a parent conglomerate in MontrÃ©al.

04:59.591 --> 05:00.592
You know what?

05:00.676 --> 05:03.804
You're gonna kinda learn about all this
at the staff meeting in a few minutes.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.597
Speaking of which, as my assistant,

05:05.681 --> 05:07.683
I'm gonna need you
to take copious notes because,

05:07.766 --> 05:09.726
you see, the staff meeting is, well,

05:09.810 --> 05:13.397
it's a crucial part of how this place
runs, and I'm at the head of it all.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.399
Is that the meeting you're talking about?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.444
No. No, that can't be
because they wouldn't do it without me.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.405
Why are they all meeting without me?

05:23.490 --> 05:27.578
But it's my thing. It's just my one thing.
Don't leave. Meeting's not over.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.080
Hey, guys?
Are you having a staff meeting in here?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.291
No, actually, we just finished up.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.126
Who's this?

05:34.209 --> 05:36.378
This is Jo. She's my new assistant.
Jo, this is the team.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.588
Hi.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.591
Hello. Okay, well, if that's it--

05:40.674 --> 05:44.094
Ian wants to change my shovel
and delay the launch.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.222
"Delay the launch"?
No, Ian, on time and on budget, remember?

05:47.306 --> 05:50.142
Poppy, what's the name of the first game
you ever fell in love with?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.602
-Contra.
-New girl, go.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.103
-Grand Theft Auto.
-Brutal. I love it.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.313
David?

05:54.396 --> 05:56.565
I've always been partial to Ms. Pac-Man,
but I don't see why that--

05:56.648 --> 06:00.652
Everybody has that game that they fell
in love with because they make an impact.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.280
Those games were somebody's legacy.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.115
This is my legacy.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.742
-Our legacy.
-Our legacy. Whatever.

06:06.825 --> 06:07.910
It's not my legacy.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.078
We have a couple more days
until code lock, right?

06:10.162 --> 06:12.539
So just let me noodle. Just let me noodle
on this one little thing.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.625
-Just let me noodle. Let me noodle.
-You used the word again.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.544
You used the "noodle" word. When you use
the noodle word, I start to get worried.

06:17.628 --> 06:21.965
David, I promise you I will not ask you
to push the expansion.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.638
I like her. She's gonna do all right.
Meeting adjourned?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.431
-Meeting adjourned. Yeah.
-Great.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.945
Man, they're having another
meeting without us? Such bullshit.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.948
Why don't they want our opinions?
We only play this game 24 hours a day.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.741
I know, isn't it great?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.285
Yeah, it's great, but it's just like

06:50.369 --> 06:52.955
we're worth so much more
than just logging bugs all day, you know?

06:53.372 --> 06:56.166
Come on, Rachel. We've only been
working here for like six months.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.169
Yeah, but, I mean,
you just have so many great ideas.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.338
-I feel like they should hear them.
-I do?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.006
Yeah. There was one you had the other day.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.884
It was, like, about increasing
the hill trolls' kick radius.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.514
You have a really good memory.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.266
Thank you.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.017
Your ideas are just really good.
So are you.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.602
Need my shit.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.191
You should probably get back to work,
because, you know,

07:21.275 --> 07:22.568
they track our eyeballs.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.903
Sure, sure. Yeah. That's a good idea.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.907
Yeah, take that, you little bitch.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.702
This is the best job I've ever had.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.745
Yeah.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.881
Brad, I need your help.
I wanna leak the shovel to Polygon.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.008
And then when all the critics love it,
which they will,

07:46.091 --> 07:48.760
they'll write about it,
and then Ian won't be able to change it.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.305
Very Machiavellian. I'm impressed.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.099
Well, you know,
I'm always thinking three steps ahead.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.185
What, "three steps ahead"?
Hey, that's a lot of steps.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.187
-Yeah, I'll go you one step--
-Don't get any closer.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.190
Sorry. I'm gonna tweak the haptic feedback
so that when you hit the--

08:01.273 --> 08:04.484
I don't really care about any of that.
All right, I'm in on your plot, okay?

08:04.943 --> 08:08.614
But if you want people to
like your shovel, forget the critics.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.158
There's only one person
you need to appeal to.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.286
Yeah.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.370
Not...

08:17.915 --> 08:19.833
-Pootie Shoe?
-Pootie Shoe.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.336
-Pootie, Pootie, Pootie... Shoe.
-Shoe.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.298
Hey, guys! This is Pootie Shoe.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.885
Wanna say hello to all my Pootie-cuties
and my Pootie-dudies,

08:29.968 --> 08:32.596
and of course
all of my LGBTQ Pootie-fruities.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.765
-I hate Pootie Shoe.
-Yeah, he's a real piece of shit.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.558
But he's a piece of shit
with over ten million followers,

08:38.644 --> 08:40.645
so if he likes your shovel,
you're good to go.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.149
Yeah, yeah, but he's a 14-year-old boy.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.527
Do you think he's really gonna understand
the subtle nuances?

08:46.610 --> 08:48.946
Fourteen-year-olds these days
are much more savvy than you think.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.323
-Your shovel's incredible, right?
-Yeah, absolutely.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.784
-Then Pootie's your man.
-Can you wrap it up?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.744
Mom, what the fuck? I'm streaming, Mom.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.080
Okay, well, can't you just pause it or...

08:58.163 --> 09:02.084
No, I can't pause it. It's in front of
ten million fucking people right now.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.627
-All right then.
-Get out. Scram!

09:03.710 --> 09:04.753
-Boy.
-Get the fuck out!

09:04.837 --> 09:07.506
You're trying to act important in front
of all your friends. I get it. Okay.

09:07.589 --> 09:11.218
Hi, sorry about that. That was not chill.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.179
My mom can be a little bit frustrating
sometimes,

09:14.263 --> 09:18.976
but overall, she's a great employee,
and she is a great mom as well.

09:24.481 --> 09:28.986
Dig, dig, dig, dig. Do you get my point?

09:29.069 --> 09:33.407
The shovel's just kinda boring,
but there is something here.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.327
What do you think about...

09:39.288 --> 09:41.123
It's not quite right, is it, David?

09:41.206 --> 09:44.585
I feel like maybe I wanna try
a couple stabby motions as well.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.628
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.672
I'm loving all this.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.465
You noodling and everything.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.051
Quick thing. I'm worried about the time.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.469
David, I'm moving as fast as I can.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.847
It's not my fault these watermelons
don't explode like real heads.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.640
I can get you real heads.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.684
Not human.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.438
-That's commitment.
-Jo, please don't get him heads.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.524
Human or otherwise.
What are you even doing out there?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.277
-I'm assisting Ian.
-You're my assistant. Assist me.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.070
-David, what's going on?
-Unbelievable.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.238
What is happening?

10:13.322 --> 10:15.991
My assistant is emasculating me
in front of the entire team,

10:16.074 --> 10:18.285
-that's what's happening.
-No, no, I mean in-- You know what?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.454
-Ian.
-Hey, Poppy!

10:20.537 --> 10:21.872
-What are you doing?
-Good news.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.417
I have turned the shovel into a weapon,
so now it's a dual-purpose.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.920
This is something that people
are gonna buy. Check this out.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.174
It's not quite right, but I'm close.

10:32.257 --> 10:35.219
I just, I'm not sure if it's like a...
if it should be a--

10:35.302 --> 10:36.720
Maybe it's an uppercut motion?

10:36.803 --> 10:40.766
Yeah, no, I don't want the shovel
to kill people. I just want it to dig.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.810
"Dig"? Do you have any idea what
the TTP on an item like this is gonna be?

10:43.894 --> 10:47.105
-Yeah, it's gonna be like--
-"TTP," guys, is "time to penis."

10:47.189 --> 10:51.568
It's the time it takes for a player
to use a new item to make a penis.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.237
Yes, I know what TTP is.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.613
Yeah, David, stop mansplaining.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.865
They're not gonna make dicks, Ian.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.909
You give the public a shovel,
they dig dicks.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.661
You give them a pen, they draw dicks.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.162
You give them some clay...

11:02.246 --> 11:03.872
Definitely gonna sculpt dicks.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.417
Ian, would you please tell my assistant
to get into the booth.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.587
I don't tell women what to do.
I allow them to make their own choices.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.089
-Thank you.
-Yeah, absolutely.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.966
Ian, they're not gonna turn them
into dicks.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.051
I'm gonna actually put a limiter on it
so they can't.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.928
Shovel with rules. That's really cool.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.223
Yeah, let's put as many rules
in the game as we can. That's super fun.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.517
Can you tell him
not to turn it into a weapon?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.853
-David, David, David.
-I can't tell them to do anything.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.145
Poppy.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.941
Why are we all here?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.442
Oh, my God, he's gonna give a speech.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.988
You are not just denying us
an opportunity to play.

11:36.071 --> 11:40.367
You are also denying that
eight-year-old boy. And I just think--

11:40.450 --> 11:43.078
She turned me into the gnome, didn't she?
Turn me back to the knight.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.580
-David, don't.
-David, switch me back.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.707
-David, don't.
-David, switch me back.

11:46.790 --> 11:47.791
-No.
-David.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.959
-David.
-Switch me back, David.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.628
-David. David! David, no.
-Switch me back please, David!

11:51.712 --> 11:53.755
I feel like I'm in the middle
of my parents' divorce again.

11:53.839 --> 11:54.840
And I'm forced to take sides.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.051
I know what you're gonna say.
It's my job to take sides. I'm the boss.

11:58.135 --> 12:01.972
But it's like all these creative types,
they make me feel like I'm not the boss.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.600
And maybe that's because my mom told me
I'm not creative or talented,

12:04.683 --> 12:06.727
and my dad was too drunk
to stand up to her.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.272
Oh, God, I don't know what to do.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.608
Would you just please tell me what to do,
Carol?

12:12.983 --> 12:15.819
I don't know, David,
because I'm not a therapist.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.405
This is Human Resources.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.782
Right, right.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.702
But maybe you could just help me out?

12:26.330 --> 12:29.875
Okay, okay. What's your management style?

12:29.958 --> 12:36.089
Well... I'd say I'm kinda like a conductor
of an orchestra.

12:36.173 --> 12:39.801
I don't know how to play an instrument
and I don't understand music,

12:39.885 --> 12:43.305
but it's like
when I wave my hands in the air,

12:43.388 --> 12:47.309
it just kinda all comes together.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.520
Okay, no,
that's not what a conductor does.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.105
-Is it not?
-It is much more complicated than that.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.815
I don't know.
I've never been to a symphony.

12:53.899 --> 12:57.945
My mother said it was gonna make me
too soft, and then my dad agreed.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.656
Actually, that is one thing
they always agreed about.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.367
Oh, my God. We should get into that.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.452
See,
even saying it I'm getting a little...

13:09.790 --> 13:11.416
-My mom--
-David!

13:12.543 --> 13:14.461
I think our time is up.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.933
Hey, guys, Pootie Shoe here.

13:28.016 --> 13:31.728
You guys know I don't like hating,
but I gotta say, not digging this shovel.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.438
Pootie-pun intended.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.984
I tried to dig a dick,
but it won't let me, which is weak sauce.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.737
You know how I feel about people
censoring my art. Hashtag free Pootie.

13:40.821 --> 13:44.366
Seriously, a dick?
That's all you can think of to do with it?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.619
If I wanted to dig holes all day,
I'd fire my gardener.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.373
Let's hope the rest of Raven's Banquet
is better than this.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.751
It's a whole new world-building mechanic,
you piece of shit.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.296
-Poppy. Pop-Tarts.
-What the hell, Brad?

13:57.379 --> 13:58.714
Pootie hates the shovel.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.341
Yeah, I saw that. Don't worry, we got
something that's gonna get him back.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.343
If I may? Picture it.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.013
The hero must vanquish his enemy,

14:06.096 --> 14:09.266
but the weapons of the old gods
are insufficient.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.269
So he must pray upon the altar of--

14:12.352 --> 14:14.021
Jesus, skip the story.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.773
The story is everything, you Neanderthal.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.734
Now, if you please.

14:18.817 --> 14:22.779
The hero must pray upon the altar of Ares
to send him...

14:26.533 --> 14:28.952
"Ian's Shovel."
The best new weapon in the game.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.581
The wood nymph is the loot crate
that gets them to buy it.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.293
What happens when this shovel is awarded?

14:37.878 --> 14:41.173
It must leave the bosom
of this fair maiden.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.968
Then what might the hero gaze upon?

14:46.220 --> 14:48.388
I am so utterly and completely confused.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.225
-Breasts.
-No. That part's clear.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.186
I don't understand
what you want me to do with this.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.271
Will you help us patch it?

14:56.355 --> 14:59.233
No.
'Cause I don't want to sell Ian's Shovel.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.734
I want to sell my shovel.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.695
But your shovel sucks. I think it does.
I actually don't know the difference.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.239
But Ian didn't like it,

15:05.322 --> 15:07.449
and he seems to have a pretty good grip
on what dorks like.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.953
-You knew Pootie wouldn't like it.
-Yeah, of course I did.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.247
But you knew that too, right?
You're always three steps ahead.

15:13.330 --> 15:18.126
And you only did this
to get me to code your sexy loot crate.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.838
Yeah. Are you still piecing this together?

15:20.921 --> 15:24.383
Brad, you are such an asshole.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.468
And now you're caught up.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.764
-I thought everyone knew.
-Yeah. I did too.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.338
Hey, can I get a coffee?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.257
I'm coming, Ian!

16:07.759 --> 16:09.595
I think about you all the time.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.682
Stupid stuff like the way
you chew on your braids sometimes.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.768
And then I catch you
and you get embarrassed and--

16:16.852 --> 16:19.479
But it's the cutest thing I've ever seen.

16:19.563 --> 16:22.900
And I know this is totally crazy...

16:23.901 --> 16:25.861
but I think you feel something too.

16:27.404 --> 16:30.115
So this is me asking you...

16:31.366 --> 16:32.618
if you feel the same.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.788
I don't know. Do you think that'll work?

16:36.872 --> 16:40.250
-I don't know.
-This is your thing, isn't it?

16:40.334 --> 16:43.295
You're Human Resources. You're supposed to
help with work-related personal problems.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.422
Dear God, you work with this person?

16:45.506 --> 16:48.008
Yeah, Dana. She's in Testing with me.
She's got, like, long hair.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.053
No. I don't wanna know. I should not know.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.096
Why? Are you gonna rat me out?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.432
If I rat you out, it would be to me.

16:55.891 --> 16:58.602
I'm starting to think nobody
in this office understands what I do.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.063
Carol. Are you already in a session?

17:01.146 --> 17:02.272
-No, actually.
-Sorry.

17:02.356 --> 17:04.316
I was just feeling kinda depressed.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.026
That's okay. I'll come back. It's cool.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.694
No. Do not come back.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.405
It's not her.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.867
Okay. Thank you for coming.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.746
I have called an emergency meeting

17:17.829 --> 17:20.790
because I have noticed
a lot of abuse in this office.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.166
Oh, no. Has someone been harassed?

17:23.252 --> 17:24.837
Yeah, David. Me.

17:25.546 --> 17:29.049
You are all abusing the office
of Human Resources.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.761
Carol, do we have to do this right now?
We are in the middle of a shovel crisis.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.222
Actually, Carol,
I think I have a fix for Ian.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.892
We're gonna take your shovel and we're
gonna put it into a sexy new loot crate.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.018
Poppy's already on board.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.104
No, no. Carol, I am not coding his whore.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.439
-Guys, I called this meeting--
-Carol, she's not a whore.

17:44.523 --> 17:48.569
She's a nubile, young wood nympho
with a really complex backstory.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.279
-C.W.?
-If I may--

17:50.362 --> 17:51.446
No, you may not.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.615
-Carol, my apologies.
-Sure.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.534
They get a little unwieldy.
You have to rein them in.

17:55.617 --> 17:56.910
-I have an idea.
-I'm sorry.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.370
Carol, why are the testers here?

17:58.453 --> 18:00.664
Because we have ideas too.
Great ideas, actually.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.249
Well, Dana has all the good ideas,
to be honest.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.750
No. No, I don't. No.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.753
Great. The brand-new employees have ideas

18:06.837 --> 18:08.881
on how to improve
our billion-dollar enterprise.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.591
Jo, make sure you get all this down.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.467
-Lay 'em on us.
-See? He wants to hear.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.554
-I don't wanna--
-"Testers overstepped their bounds."

18:15.637 --> 18:16.638
I do have an idea.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.974
The whore thing is a little weird,
I think.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.642
Preposterous.

18:20.726 --> 18:24.229
I will not sit here and take notes
from this jumped-up popinjay.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.981
-I am the head writer.
-You're like 80, man.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.318
Hey, hey. Have some respect, tester.
The man won a Nebula Award.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.694
That was 1973.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.405
You met him at a state fair
when he was selling rotisserie chickens.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.449
-Also award-winning.
-The man's a dual threat.

18:35.532 --> 18:39.494
-Guys, if we could, just for one second--
-I'm sorry. This guy sleeps in the office.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.121
Only when he drinks too much, Carol.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.831
Which is every day.
I'm pretty sure he lives here.

18:42.915 --> 18:43.999
That's not true, is it?

18:44.583 --> 18:49.755
Carol, to understand my present,
you must also understand my past.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.090
Albania, 1939--

18:52.174 --> 18:53.926
No! No more fucking backstory!

18:57.012 --> 19:00.140
I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge.

19:00.599 --> 19:01.600
We should code lock,

19:01.683 --> 19:04.853
let QA do final verification,
and then just release the shovel as is.

19:04.937 --> 19:08.857
David, the shovel is not ready as is,
okay? I just need a little bit more time--

19:08.941 --> 19:10.984
Expansion goes live on Monday.

19:11.068 --> 19:14.112
It's Friday at 5:00 p.m.
He's gonna ask you to push it.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.658
No, he's not. He actually promised me he
wasn't gonna ask me to push the expansion.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.118
David, I'm going to ask you
to push the expansion.

19:20.202 --> 19:24.081
What? No. No, no.
No, you said there was enough time.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.333
You said we had this.
You promised me you wouldn't push it.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.252
There isn't. We don't. And I lied.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.546
-You're fucking me.
-Yes.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.047
-You're fucking me.
-But I'm not enjoying it.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.590
-It's for the game.
-I knew this was gonna happen.

19:33.674 --> 19:37.135
-It doesn't make me feel better.
-You are a dick.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.512
-You're a dick!
-Oh, my--

19:38.595 --> 19:40.889
Jo, please. Thank you.
I don't need your help.

19:40.973 --> 19:43.392
David, Poppy is being a dick, okay?

19:43.475 --> 19:46.019
The expansion is not ready.
It needs to be pushed.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.063
-Just a little bit, then I got it.
-It does not need to be pushed.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.107
-No. David, do not push it.
-Just a little bit.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.568
-Not a little bit, not at all.
-Just a little bit.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.070
-Do not push it.
-Push it. Push it.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.322
-Push the expansion.
-Do not push it.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.586
David,
if you don't make a goddamn decision...

20:10.669 --> 20:13.213
Okay, I choose Mom! Poppy.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.340
-Shit, "I choose Poppy" is what I meant.
-Yes!

20:15.424 --> 20:16.758
Ian, I know you're the visionary,

20:16.842 --> 20:20.846
but I am the executive producer,
and I'm gonna make an executive decision.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.308
The code is locked. Everybody, go home!

20:24.391 --> 20:27.644
Fine! You know what?
You wanna ruin the game? Don't trust me.

20:27.728 --> 20:28.937
What do I know about the game?

20:29.021 --> 20:31.356
I don't know anything about the game.
I'm only the creator.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.734
"Ian exudes masculinity."

20:33.817 --> 20:36.069
You made the right decision, David.
You did a good thing.

20:36.153 --> 20:37.529
Thanks, Mom. Poppy.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.366
Meeting adjourned.

20:43.452 --> 20:46.455
We did it. We locked Raven's Banquet.

20:47.456 --> 20:49.124
This calls for a drink.

20:51.877 --> 20:52.878
Okay.

21:00.469 --> 21:03.639
No, no, no! I need more blood.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.979
No! No.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.986
Shit. Shit!

21:19.446 --> 21:20.656
What are you doing?

21:25.244 --> 21:26.912
-I'm working.
-Yeah, I know.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.830
I got an alert
from the version control system

21:28.914 --> 21:30.457
that someone was butchering my code.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.459
Cool, thanks, Pop! Thanks for coming in!

21:32.543 --> 21:34.461
Why couldn't you just let me
have this one thing?

21:34.545 --> 21:35.838
I appreciate all the help!

21:35.921 --> 21:37.172
That's all I wanted.

21:37.256 --> 21:40.717
I just wanted one thing in the whole game

21:40.801 --> 21:43.762
that I could point to and say,
"That's mine."

21:44.596 --> 21:46.598
-Seriously?
-That's it.

21:46.682 --> 21:50.435
Poppy, the entire game is yours.
You're the one that built it.

21:50.519 --> 21:51.687
I built your vision.

21:53.647 --> 21:56.233
It's like you're this brilliant painter--

21:56.316 --> 21:57.317
Yes.

21:57.860 --> 22:00.654
Just let me finish my--
You're this brilliant painter...

22:00.737 --> 22:01.738
Okay.

22:03.657 --> 22:05.158
...and I'm your favorite brush.

22:05.242 --> 22:10.122
I'm just, like, some tool that you use
to create your masterpiece.

22:12.249 --> 22:15.335
I like that metaphor, but it's not
quite right, is it? I think if you--

22:15.419 --> 22:17.462
Are you seriously about to noodle
on my metaphor right now?

22:17.546 --> 22:20.507
-What's the paint in that scenario?
-Could you just listen to what I'm saying?

22:20.591 --> 22:23.468
Do you have any idea
how frustrating that is?

22:23.886 --> 22:26.180
All right. Okay.
You're right. You're right.

22:26.263 --> 22:28.098
Poppy, you're right. You're right. Look.

22:28.515 --> 22:32.769
In that... somewhat flawed metaphor,

22:32.853 --> 22:36.732
you are both the painter and the brush.

22:37.774 --> 22:42.696
I'm just the guy who stands behind you
and tells you what to paint.

22:43.697 --> 22:47.117
But you're the one
that actually makes it happen.

22:47.618 --> 22:50.621
I wish I could do that, but I can't.
I need you.

22:53.123 --> 22:55.751
And that makes me so frustrated,
but I do it anyway

22:55.834 --> 22:59.671
because it's what makes the game better,
and that's all that matters.

23:08.680 --> 23:14.269
I just know that this thing
can be the coolest item in the game,

23:14.353 --> 23:15.687
and they will love it.

23:15.771 --> 23:19.566
I don't know why I know that. I just do.

23:23.695 --> 23:27.533
Start by adding an acceleration curve
on the front end to get a weightier swing.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.328
Pop the big motors on
with smaller pulses at the finish,

23:31.411 --> 23:33.872
so you get that, like, crunch sensation.

23:33.956 --> 23:37.501
And boost the initial velocity
of the blood particles at impact.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.089
And that'll make it cooler?

23:42.506 --> 23:44.633
Yeah, that'll make it cooler.

23:46.844 --> 23:48.387
And they will love it.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.975
I don't know how I know that.

23:58.564 --> 23:59.940
-I just-- Hold on.
-Great. Awesome.

24:00.023 --> 24:02.651
-Let's get to work on it immediately.
-I was gonna do the "I just do."

24:02.734 --> 24:04.570
-I know what you were gonna say.
-It was gonna be really cool.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.573
-We're running out of time here.
-You never let me have my moment.

24:11.076 --> 24:13.078
Pootie, Pootie, Pootie... Shoe.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.621
Reviews.

24:17.332 --> 24:18.500
All right, guys.

24:20.002 --> 24:23.505
As you know,
Raven's Banquet dropped this morning.

24:24.131 --> 24:28.343
You best believe your boy spent all day
in his PJs just bombing that joint.

24:28.427 --> 24:31.471
First off, I have to say...

24:34.933 --> 24:36.268
thanks to Rager Body Mist

24:36.351 --> 24:39.479
for keeping your Pootie smelling fresh
and his parents' mortgage paid in full.

24:40.898 --> 24:42.983
Rager. Smell the rage.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.235
Come on, you little piece of shit.

24:45.319 --> 24:46.737
But let me get real with you guys.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.573
You know my love
for Mythic Quest runs deep.

24:49.656 --> 24:53.702
So this statement that I'm about
to lay down is really, really heavy.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.625
Raven's Banquet...

25:01.668 --> 25:03.629
is a straight-up masterpiece.

25:03.712 --> 25:04.755
Oh, my God!

25:06.048 --> 25:07.132
Yes!

25:07.216 --> 25:09.009
The thing that I love most...

25:10.344 --> 25:11.720
is the shovel.

25:14.348 --> 25:17.726
These guys just always find a way
to surprise me.

25:18.310 --> 25:21.396
Exploding people's heads with this thing
is straight fire.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.607
Pure crunch, man.

25:24.274 --> 25:25.651
Now, let's make it official.

25:25.734 --> 25:28.570
Shut up, shut up, shut up! He's giving
the rating. He's giving the rating.

25:32.658 --> 25:33.909
Four B-holes.

25:34.993 --> 25:37.079
Four B-holes! Four B-holes!

25:37.162 --> 25:39.081
Four, four, four B-holes.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.499
Four B-holes!

25:41.083 --> 25:42.292
Four B-holes!

25:42.376 --> 25:43.794
Are those buttholes?

25:43.877 --> 25:46.129
Yeah.
So, he has this butthole rating system.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.549
Anything above two is exceptional.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.133
This job is so weird.

25:50.634 --> 25:52.886
Yeah. Isn't it the greatest?

25:55.305 --> 25:57.015
Yep. It's the greatest.

25:57.099 --> 25:58.559
I'm gonna play this game forever.

26:04.857 --> 26:09.278
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Traffic was a nightmare.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.363
-What's up?
-We got four buttholes.

26:11.947 --> 26:13.490
Dear God.

26:14.199 --> 26:17.411
I took a lover in Guam once.
She had three.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.038
But four...

26:21.832 --> 26:23.250
that's the dream.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.669
What?

26:28.839 --> 26:30.841
Hey, expansion's a hit.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.593
Reddit, Steam, Kotaku, all positive,

26:32.676 --> 26:34.469
and we're selling thousands of shovels
every hour.

26:34.553 --> 26:37.389
Biggest item in the game.
So congrats to you.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.141
Or to Ian. Whichever of you won.

26:39.224 --> 26:40.851
I can't keep track anymore,
and I don't really care.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.769
-It's both of us. Both of us won.
-Great.

26:42.853 --> 26:44.188
Where is he?

26:44.271 --> 26:47.065
Well, you have done it again.

26:47.149 --> 26:52.070
You have turned my vision into a reality,
and I could not be more proud.

26:52.571 --> 26:56.617
But, of course, I could not have done this
without my muse.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.785
My partner, really.

26:58.869 --> 27:01.371
You may have seen her around the office
these last few days

27:01.455 --> 27:02.789
a little worse for wear,

27:02.873 --> 27:05.292
but I can tell you
that I never lost faith in her.

27:07.169 --> 27:09.838
In fact, I wanna bring her up here.
Where is she?

27:09.922 --> 27:11.131
Get up there, Pop.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.508
He's talking about the shovel.

27:12.591 --> 27:15.052
The shovel! There she is. Heyo!

27:15.135 --> 27:16.553
-Hell yeah!
-Sweet!

27:18.138 --> 27:19.223
To the shovel!

27:20.557 --> 27:21.975
To Mythic Quest!

27:22.434 --> 27:24.686
Ian. Ian. Ian.
