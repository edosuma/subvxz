00:03.062 --> 00:05.379
(man breathing loudly)

00:07.416 --> 00:09.324
<i> -I think I'm dying.</i>
-Can you tell me your address?

00:09.343 --> 00:11.326
<i> I'm not anywhere.</i>
<i> Aah, I'm bleeding. Yeah.</i>

00:11.345 --> 00:13.012
<i> -I think I was shot.</i>
-Okay.

00:13.163 --> 00:14.496
-Can you tell me your name?
<i> -Edgar.</i>

00:14.590 --> 00:16.015
Okay, Edgar. You said
you didn't know where you were?

00:16.166 --> 00:18.017
<i> Woods. Last thing I remember.</i>

00:18.168 --> 00:19.501
Are there any landmarks
around you?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.336
Something to help
narrow down your location?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.671
<i> It's too dark.</i>
<i> I think I'm underground.</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:26.508
I think I'm buried alive.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.610
(panting)

00:30.031 --> 00:32.573
(insects chirring)

00:46.213 --> 00:48.547
<i> MAN (over radio):</i>
<i> 118, this is Fire 1.</i>

00:48.698 --> 00:50.883
<i> We're looking for a needle</i>
<i> in a haystack out here.</i>

00:51.110 --> 00:52.867
(sirens wailing)

00:52.961 --> 00:55.679
(horn honking)

00:59.894 --> 01:02.452
All right, victim's name
is Edgar Hill.

01:02.546 --> 01:04.304
He told dispatch
that he was carjacked,

01:04.398 --> 01:07.215
got shot and buried in some sort
of coffin out here.

01:07.309 --> 01:08.959
Based on the size
of an average male,

01:08.977 --> 01:10.903
that box is probably
86 by 30 inches.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.813
That's 45 feet of cubic space,

01:12.965 --> 01:14.556
most of which is taken up
by Edgar.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.317
So he's got ten minutes
to an hour's worth of air left.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.078
We don't know how long
he's been underground, right?

01:19.229 --> 01:20.562
BOBBY: Or which piece
of ground he's under.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.989
Cell towers can only limit
the search by so much.

01:23.142 --> 01:24.474
Let's fan out.

01:24.493 --> 01:27.160
Hey, Cap, do we know how serious
that gunshot wound is?

01:27.313 --> 01:28.403
Blood loss may have
gotten him already.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.130
Dispatch still has him
on the line.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.832
Hopefully, they can
keep him talking.

01:31.984 --> 01:34.384
HEN:
And not hyperventilating.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.180
<i> (Edgar breathing loudly)</i>

01:47.166 --> 01:48.181
I know you're scared,

01:48.334 --> 01:49.666
but staying calm
will help you stay alive.

01:49.759 --> 01:52.111
The faster you breathe,
the more oxygen you consume.

01:52.262 --> 01:54.262
And we want you to save
as much oxygen as you can

01:54.281 --> 01:56.022

<i> You understand?</i>

01:56.117 --> 01:58.117
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

01:58.268 --> 02:01.620
A mystery is unfolding in the
deep, dark woods at this hour,

02:01.847 --> 02:03.271
where it appears a man was shot

02:03.365 --> 02:05.440
and buried alive
earlier tonight.

Nothing, Cap.

HEN:
If he's really out here,

02:21.033 --> 02:23.142
shouldn't he be able
to hear us?

<i> on the scene.</i>

02:25.371 --> 02:27.795

02:27.815 --> 02:30.407
Can barely hear anything.

-We've got a pulse.
-Roll him on his side.

-I'll clear his airway.
-Found the bullet wound.

05:30.238 --> 05:32.556
-(groaning)
-Pulse 120 and thready.

05:32.574 --> 05:36.150
BP 90/50. Breath sounds
severely diminished bilaterally.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.336
He's aspirated.
We've probably got

05:37.487 --> 05:38.986
hypovolemic shock.
While we're waiting,

05:39.006 --> 05:40.730
let's start a line.

05:40.824 --> 05:42.582
EDGAR:
I'm so sorry.

05:42.734 --> 05:43.917
I'm so sorry, Lizzie.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.219

<i> TAYLOR: We've had no official</i>
<i> word from rescue personnel,</i>

for well...

05:55.004 --> 05:57.080
-Oh, coming through.
-...over...

05:57.099 --> 06:01.768
Uh, it appears
the man has been found.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.086
There you see him.

06:03.179 --> 06:05.697
First responders
literally pulling him

06:05.849 --> 06:07.607
from the ground moments ago.

We do not yet have the identity
nor the condition of the victim,

06:12.206 --> 06:15.115

06:15.267 --> 06:18.118
Investigators are now beginning
to arrive on the scene

<i> BOBBY: Detective,</i>
<i> it's good to have you back.</i>

06:39.233 --> 06:42.216
It's good to be back.
So what do we got?

06:42.310 --> 06:43.810
Victim is on the way
to the hospital.

06:43.962 --> 06:45.070
Looks like
he got shot in the back,

06:45.221 --> 06:47.147
put in a coffin
and buried up here.

06:47.299 --> 06:50.391
coffin? I thought the victim
said it was a carjacking.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.226
That's what he told dispatch.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.414
So carjackers that dig holes
and bring coffins. That's new.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.157
Victim say anything
when you pulled him out?

06:57.251 --> 06:58.992
He was calling out
to somebody named Lizzie,

06:59.144 --> 07:00.252
saying he was sorry.

07:00.403 --> 07:02.028
Could've been his wife
or girlfriend?

07:02.180 --> 07:04.923
-Your guys did that?
-No, victim did.

07:05.074 --> 07:07.426
Tried to punch
and claw his way out.

07:07.577 --> 07:09.169
Buried alive.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.097
Well, that's the stuff
of nightmares.

07:19.498 --> 07:22.107

Harry?

07:48.284 --> 07:50.469
Didn't you hear me calling you?

07:50.620 --> 07:51.711
No. I thought I saw...

07:51.863 --> 07:52.971
-What?
-(car engine starts)

07:53.198 --> 07:55.715
Come on. I got to drop you off.

07:55.867 --> 07:56.975
I don't want
to be late for work.

07:57.202 --> 08:00.145
You know, you jumped
like you saw a ghost.

08:02.298 --> 08:04.891
NATHANSON:
It's normal
to be curious about him.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.968
The man who kidnapped you.

08:07.062 --> 08:09.713
I can't believe
my dad showed you that.

08:09.806 --> 08:10.989
You're not in trouble, Harry.

08:11.216 --> 08:13.066
You didn't do anything wrong.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.719
Your father's just concerned.

08:15.812 --> 08:18.079
He's a snitch.

08:21.409 --> 08:24.410
Well, he's a snitch
who loves you.

08:24.563 --> 08:26.913
Can you tell me what made you
want to look that up?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.414
No. I don't want
to talk about it.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.760
Not with you, and not with them.
They weren't kidnapped.

08:34.072 --> 08:35.847
None of you have any idea
what that was like.

08:36.074 --> 08:39.500
But we want to...
understand what happened to you.

08:39.594 --> 08:42.020
How is that gonna help me?

08:42.247 --> 08:45.506
One of the ways
we move past our trauma

08:45.526 --> 08:48.601
is to confront it and share it.

08:48.754 --> 08:50.362
You're just like them.

08:50.589 --> 08:52.438
Everybody wants me to move on,
like nothing happen.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.090
That's not what I meant.

08:54.109 --> 08:57.518
The last thing I want is for you
to pretend it didn't happen.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.596
Because it did.

08:59.689 --> 09:01.856
I see him sometimes.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.434
See him where?
In your dreams?

09:04.527 --> 09:06.193
No.

09:06.288 --> 09:10.131
I only see him when I'm awake.

09:12.444 --> 09:14.386
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> She called it a breakthrough.</i>

09:14.537 --> 09:16.296
<i> BOBBY:</i>
<i> Isn't it?</i>
<i> Harry's starting to open up.</i>

09:16.390 --> 09:18.223
Well, to her.
Not to me or Michael.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.392
-He still doesn't trust us.
-Well, look,

09:20.619 --> 09:23.711
I know that it hurts, feels like
Harry's shutting you out, but

09:23.805 --> 09:25.805
try to be patient. It's just
gonna take a little time.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.457
What if we're running out
of time?

09:27.475 --> 09:30.384
He barely said a word
on the way back to Michael's.

09:30.478 --> 09:33.813
And now he's visiting that
damned Jeffery Hudson website.

09:33.965 --> 09:35.298
Harry's looking for answers.

09:35.317 --> 09:36.816
Something terrible happened
to him.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.985
He can't confront Jeffery, so
he's trying to understand him.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.970
Yeah. That's what
my therapist said.

09:41.064 --> 09:43.248
But it should be noted
that neither of you are

09:43.399 --> 09:45.825
on that website
with crosshairs over your face.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.645
-And the things
that they wrote about me.
-Aren't true.

09:48.663 --> 09:50.330
You didn't drive that man
to do anything.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.591
Hudson made his choices,
didn't care who he hurt,

09:52.818 --> 09:54.317
and that is on him, not on you.

09:54.336 --> 09:56.502
Oh, Harry still blames me.

09:56.655 --> 10:00.824
I mean, it just feels like the
harder I try to hold on to him,

10:00.917 --> 10:03.226
the more he slips away.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.110
<i> RANSONE:</i>
<i> It's quite a story, Mr. Hill.</i>

10:12.337 --> 10:14.112
(exhales) I know, right?

10:14.263 --> 10:18.024
Yeah. Well, the tale is
a little thin, though.

10:18.176 --> 10:20.343
You say
that a man took you hostage

10:20.395 --> 10:22.120
at gunpoint and made you drive
to the woods.

10:22.347 --> 10:25.123
But you don't remember anything
that happened after he shot you.

10:25.274 --> 10:27.608
They say trauma can screw
with your memory.

10:27.702 --> 10:32.113
You also don't remember where
you were when he got in the car.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.633
It all happened so fast. I...

10:34.860 --> 10:37.469
I-I think I was driving home.

10:37.696 --> 10:38.878
Okay, from where?

10:39.030 --> 10:42.223
(sighs) I don't remember.

10:43.034 --> 10:44.217
And if I was to ask you

10:44.369 --> 10:46.627
if you got a good look
at your abductor?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.538
Never saw his face.

10:48.556 --> 10:50.039
Right.

10:50.058 --> 10:52.041
He had one
of those things on, a...

10:52.060 --> 10:55.044
What do you call it?
A, uh... a baklava.

10:55.063 --> 10:57.322
-Balaclava?
-Yeah.

10:57.549 --> 10:59.807
Exactly.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.308
My mind's just not all there.

11:01.403 --> 11:02.902
Maybe we should start
from the beginning,

11:03.054 --> 11:05.238
see if we can help
jog your memory.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.815
Mr. Hill. I hope
you don't mind, but I'm...

11:07.909 --> 11:09.242
Now's not a good time,
Ms. Kelly.

11:09.394 --> 11:12.153
Taylor Kelly. Channel 8 news.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.821
(laughing):
Well, I'm a big fan.

11:13.915 --> 11:15.081
-Yeah.
-She can stay.

11:15.233 --> 11:18.067
TAYLOR:
Well, that's great.

11:18.086 --> 11:19.844
Maybe you'd like
to give an on-camera statement

11:19.996 --> 11:21.587
about your ordeal.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.014
I'm sure the public will want

11:23.241 --> 11:26.426
to hear your account
of this atrocious crime.

11:26.578 --> 11:27.577
I don't remember much.

11:27.595 --> 11:30.096
Is your wife here?
Maybe she can talk

11:30.248 --> 11:32.765
about her relief
after your miraculous rescue.

11:32.918 --> 11:34.250
-Lizzie?
-Mm-hmm.

11:34.343 --> 11:36.419
EDGAR:
Yeah, she's not here.

11:36.438 --> 11:40.590
-Is she home?
-She's on a trip. A cruise.

11:40.683 --> 11:42.108
-In Alaska.
-Mm.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.518
-Girls' cruise trip thing.
-Oh.

11:44.538 --> 11:48.598
You know, communication
out there can be pretty spotty.

11:48.616 --> 11:51.784
We can call the ship. I'm sure
they could track her down.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.546
Well, reservation wasn't
under her name.

11:54.697 --> 11:57.457
She'd still be on the manifest.
All passengers are.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.034
You know, uh...

12:00.053 --> 12:02.036
I don't feel so good. Um,

12:02.130 --> 12:04.280
maybe if we could
finish this later...

12:04.299 --> 12:07.058
-If you could leave a card...
-BOTH: Of course.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.980
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

12:13.900 --> 12:15.900
You might want
to call me first, Mr. Hill.

12:16.127 --> 12:19.070
If you're in trouble,
I can help you.

12:20.982 --> 12:22.815
(door closes)

12:22.968 --> 12:23.983
That was weird, right?

12:24.135 --> 12:26.486
His little song and dance
about the wife?

12:26.638 --> 12:27.971
No comment.

12:27.989 --> 12:30.231
His story doesn't
make any sense.

12:30.325 --> 12:32.475
What kind of carjacker
puts someone in a coffin?

12:32.568 --> 12:35.402
-Your firefighter boyfriend
tell you about that?
-No.

12:35.497 --> 12:37.313
I watched your crime scene techs
pull it out of a hole

12:37.332 --> 12:39.332
and put it in the back
of their van.

12:39.484 --> 12:42.318
Come on.
I can help you, Detective.

12:42.337 --> 12:43.911
You must have a theory.

12:44.005 --> 12:45.838
Off the record?

12:45.991 --> 12:49.250
All right, here's what
I can tell you. Off the record.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.919
I'm putting an officer
on Mr. Hill's door.

12:52.013 --> 12:53.772
No one is going in or out
other than hospital staff.

12:53.923 --> 12:56.274
Wow. You think the alleged
carjacker could come back?

12:56.501 --> 13:00.236
No. But I'm pretty sure
you'll try.

13:11.349 --> 13:13.458
Yeah. Buck is convinced
he heard the bells

of the Old North Church in the
background when she called.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.188

13:52.724 --> 13:54.148
<i> He was in medical school.</i>

13:54.167 --> 13:56.742

14:04.752 --> 14:06.660
Eva.

14:06.754 --> 14:08.421
She called this morning.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.757
Wants to come by the station

14:11.852 --> 14:13.759

Or maybe I am.

<i> MAY:</i>

Buried alive.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.132
You did a great job.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.603
He sounded so scared, trapped,

14:56.712 --> 14:59.230
thinking he was gonna die.

14:59.382 --> 15:01.215
You think that's how Harry felt?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.808
Your brother wasn't buried
in the woods.

15:02.903 --> 15:06.887
No, he was walled up under
some stairs. Totally different.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.799
May, I'd really
rather not relive it,

15:09.817 --> 15:11.392
if that's okay with you.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.653
You know, we're-we're trying

stop bringing it up?

15:18.476 --> 15:21.644

15:21.737 --> 15:23.087
We<i> are</i> talking about it.

15:23.314 --> 15:25.314
Y-Your brother has
his therapist.

15:25.408 --> 15:28.501
Your mom has hers. Hell, I'm
even considering talking to one.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.503
Right, but we're not talking
to each other.

15:30.597 --> 15:35.324
Dad, we all went through it,
in our own ways,

15:35.343 --> 15:37.101
but we aren't
processing it together.

15:37.253 --> 15:38.511
We're barely processing it
at all.

15:38.663 --> 15:41.255
We are all doing the best
that we can.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.333
Are we? He hasn't been back
to the house.

15:44.427 --> 15:48.112
And I can't help but notice,
neither have you.

15:48.339 --> 15:51.507
(sighs)
You know, that's not gonna
solve the problem.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.267
MAY:
No,

15:53.286 --> 15:56.037
but it could be a step
in the right direction.

15:59.367 --> 16:02.460

16:06.708 --> 16:08.299
You look good.

16:08.526 --> 16:09.801
Thank you.

16:10.028 --> 16:13.137
-What do you want, Eva?
-I'm leaving, Hen.

16:13.865 --> 16:15.956
California.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.868
You know, I've done my time,
gotten clean.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.886
It will be two years next month.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.039
And I figure
it's time for a-a fresh start.

16:23.132 --> 16:25.057
Well, congratulations.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.226
Safe travels.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.970
So, two years
without getting high--

16:29.990 --> 16:32.398
it's a long time
to sit with your mistakes,

16:32.492 --> 16:36.477
the things you've done
and the people you've hurt.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.904
And I know I hurt you.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.291
In ways that I don't even
have the words for.

16:43.745 --> 16:45.486
I'm one of your steps.

16:45.505 --> 16:49.215
I owe you so much.
You saved my life.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.584
You took in my kid.

16:51.736 --> 16:54.403
And despite everything
I did to you,

16:54.422 --> 16:57.181
-you never once
took it out on him.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.684
How do you know that?
Did you talk to Denny?

16:59.835 --> 17:02.186
No. I know you.

17:02.413 --> 17:03.763
Look.

17:03.915 --> 17:06.932
Look, look. I'm-I'm...

that you're doing better,

17:09.696 --> 17:11.696

17:11.847 --> 17:15.366

taking the time to hear me out.

20:47.062 --> 20:49.247

someone trained you well.

20:49.398 --> 20:51.082
Eli.

20:51.191 --> 20:53.642

in Boston, Howie?

20:53.661 --> 20:57.046
-Chasing ghosts. Long story.

<i> Hey.</i>

21:00.668 --> 21:03.652
-Heard you were back.
-I missed you, too.

21:03.746 --> 21:06.322
-Also heard you caught yourself
a real head-scratcher.
-Mm.

21:06.415 --> 21:09.583
-Buried-alive guy.
-Yeah. Bobby tell you
about that?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.176
No. Taylor Kelly.

21:11.329 --> 21:14.346
-Heard you two really got
into it at the hospital.
-(sighs)

21:14.499 --> 21:16.832
You posted a uni
to keep her out?

21:16.925 --> 21:19.335
I couldn't help myself.
The woman's a menace.

21:19.428 --> 21:20.761
I'm just trying to figure out

21:20.855 --> 21:23.856
how Edgar Hill ended up
buried alive...

21:24.008 --> 21:27.009
and why he won't tell anyone
what happened.

21:27.028 --> 21:29.436
Uh, isn't that the police's job?

21:29.530 --> 21:33.440
I don't think they have any idea
what they're looking for.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.961
Mm. Edgar Hill.

21:37.112 --> 21:39.188
Carjacked, shot
and buried alive.

21:39.281 --> 21:41.114
Claims to have no memory
of what happened

21:41.134 --> 21:42.708
and no idea
of who might want to hurt him.

21:42.860 --> 21:44.284
-Married?
-Yeah.

21:44.411 --> 21:45.786
Lizzie. Married ten years.

21:45.880 --> 21:46.971
Current whereabouts unknown.

21:47.198 --> 21:48.806
He said she was
on a cruise to Alaska.

21:49.033 --> 21:52.518
Let me guess. He lied?

21:53.871 --> 21:55.721
"I'm sorry, Lizzie."

21:55.873 --> 21:57.723
That's what he said

21:57.875 --> 21:59.650
when you pulled him
out of the hole, right?

21:59.760 --> 22:02.803
How do you know that?
I didn't tell you that.

22:02.897 --> 22:05.138
What? You think
you're my only source?

22:05.158 --> 22:07.066
ATHENA:
Were you able
to track down the coffin?

22:07.218 --> 22:09.068
Was able to trace it
to the store, but that was it.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.145
They couldn't tell me who bought
those specific boards.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.648
Just gave me a list
of everyone who made a purchase.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.559
It's gonna take some time
to run down all these.

22:16.577 --> 22:18.502
Did learn
something interesting, though.

22:18.654 --> 22:21.839
The manager at the store said
that they all knew Edgar Hill.

22:22.066 --> 22:23.248
Apparently, he shopped there.

22:23.401 --> 22:26.085
Well, he is a contractor,
so that's not surprising.

22:26.237 --> 22:27.753
He'd been in a lot
the last couple of weeks,

22:27.905 --> 22:31.164
but, oddly, manager couldn't
find any purchase records.

22:31.184 --> 22:34.727
So he's coming into the store,
but not buying anything?

22:36.856 --> 22:38.522
You think
he's visiting a friend?

22:38.674 --> 22:40.691
<i> TAYLOR:</i>
<i> The wife didn't have</i>
<i> any friends.</i>

22:40.843 --> 22:42.693
At least according
to the neighbors.

22:42.845 --> 22:44.195
But then, past few weeks,

22:44.346 --> 22:46.589
they started noticing a van
parked down the street.

22:46.607 --> 22:48.849
And one of them
saw Lizzie getting out of it.

22:48.943 --> 22:52.111
Could've been anyone's van.
Could've been the pool guy.

22:52.263 --> 22:53.537
Okay, never had a pool,
but I'm pretty sure

22:53.689 --> 22:54.763
you don't meet with them

22:54.782 --> 22:56.022
inside their van.

22:56.117 --> 22:58.767
You think
she was having an affair.

22:58.861 --> 23:00.544
I think there was definitely
something wrong

23:00.696 --> 23:02.195
with that marriage.

23:02.289 --> 23:04.030
<i> RANSONE:</i>
<i> He was having</i>
<i> financial troubles.</i>

23:04.125 --> 23:06.032
And still managed
to find a way to pay

23:06.127 --> 23:10.137
for three life insurance
policies on the wife.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.038
They don't have kids.

23:12.133 --> 23:14.058
She didn't work
outside the home.

23:14.209 --> 23:16.802
And he let the policy
on himself lapse.

23:16.954 --> 23:18.378
Lizzie was furious
when she found out.

23:18.472 --> 23:21.790
The mail carrier said they had a
screaming match in the driveway.

23:21.809 --> 23:23.550
Over life insurance?

23:23.569 --> 23:25.886
He told her she'd never get
another penny out of him,

23:25.980 --> 23:28.054
dead or alive.

23:28.149 --> 23:30.574
She told him, money or not,

23:30.801 --> 23:32.968
she'd rather see him dead.

23:33.061 --> 23:35.896
Still, one thing
just doesn't make sense.

23:35.990 --> 23:37.656
The Hills had two cars.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.309
A seven-year-old sedan
and a brand-new Range Rover.

23:40.327 --> 23:42.661
Fancy car like that
would make Edgar a target.

23:42.813 --> 23:44.422
Except he claims
that he was driving the sedan

23:44.649 --> 23:45.739
when he got carjacked.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.241
But he had the keys to the SUV.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.653
Did you check the garage
at their house?

23:50.746 --> 23:52.655
Empty. Both cars are gone.

23:52.673 --> 23:55.081
I tried to ask Edgar about it,
but he stopped talking.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.934
Suppose the wife could have it.

23:57.161 --> 23:58.602
Or maybe he gave it to a friend.

23:58.754 --> 24:01.272
Someone who works
at a home improvement store?

24:01.499 --> 24:04.166
<i> TAYLOR:</i>
<i> Okay, I know it sounds crazy,</i>
<i> but hear me out.</i>

24:04.185 --> 24:05.443
The marriage is in trouble.

24:05.670 --> 24:08.854
Lizzie wants out until
she discovers the money is gone.

24:09.006 --> 24:10.339
Edgar's business is failing.

24:10.357 --> 24:12.265
He's about to lose everything
he has.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.009
She's invested years
into that marriage.

24:14.028 --> 24:16.679
She is not about
to walk away with nothing,

24:16.697 --> 24:18.180
or worse, half of nothing.

24:18.199 --> 24:20.291
But Edgar still has
those life insurance policies,

24:20.442 --> 24:21.850
and they're worth millions.

24:21.869 --> 24:23.276
Just not as long
as Lizzie's alive.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.612
The house, the cars,
the retirement accounts--

24:25.706 --> 24:27.539
they're worth millions.

24:27.692 --> 24:29.875
But only if Edgar is dead.

it was a professional hit?

31:14.022 --> 31:15.430
She was not happy.

31:15.449 --> 31:18.950
So she decided to turn
the tables on her husband then,

31:19.103 --> 31:20.711
<i> have you kill him instead.</i>

31:20.938 --> 31:22.212
