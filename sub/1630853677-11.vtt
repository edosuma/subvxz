- Oh,

00:36.870 --> 00:38.664

00:38.664 --> 00:39.665
No.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.250
So you think she will pay for it?

- I'm not... thrilled about spending
so much time with Jessie.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.130

that Ben and I hooked up

00:58.308 --> 01:01.770

We hang out all the time.

You didn't know her.
