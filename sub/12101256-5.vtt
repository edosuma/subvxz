Mira! Mira, do something!

18:24.103 --> 18:25.805
[thud]

18:35.314 --> 18:38.117
[gasping]

18:42.221 --> 18:45.324
Why didn't you do something,
hmm?

18:45.358 --> 18:46.459
Are you a coward?

18:46.492 --> 18:47.460
‐Hey!
‐Are you a coward now?!

18:47.493 --> 18:48.160
Violet: Ok, stop it!

18:48.194 --> 18:48.995
Is that what you are?!

18:49.028 --> 18:49.996
Stop!

18:50.029 --> 18:51.497
We could have saved Zuma!

18:51.530 --> 18:52.198
You saw her‐

18:52.231 --> 18:52.865
We could have done that.

18:52.898 --> 18:53.733
You saw her, ok?

18:53.766 --> 18:55.468
She was‐ I don't know
what she was,

18:55.501 --> 18:56.802
but it wasn't Zuma.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.738
It wasn't her.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.740
It was the shadow.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.542
I saw it down there right
before she attacked you.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.377
What did you see?

19:04.410 --> 19:05.344
I don't know.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.880
It was like a shadow came alive.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.516
It did something to Zuma
and I think it killed Claire

19:10.549 --> 19:13.719
and now it is going to kill us.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.822
What is it?

19:16.856 --> 19:19.692
I'm... I'm not sure.

19:23.062 --> 19:29.201
Remember that piece of
whatever this is that got out?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.537
What if it got back
to the Dark One?

19:31.570 --> 19:35.007
You know, like what if
it kinda just went home,

19:35.041 --> 19:37.376
like it's a piece of her?

19:37.410 --> 19:39.712
Zuma was trying to get this,
which can only mean

19:39.745 --> 19:45.651
that whatever was controlling
her was sent by the Dark One.

19:45.685 --> 19:50.723
She knows a piece of her is
in this and she wants it back.

19:50.756 --> 19:55.528
There was this tale that
went through the Sisterhood.

19:55.561 --> 19:56.328
What tale?

19:56.362 --> 19:58.264
It was long before
you were turned.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.733
It was a hunter,
the Vanator.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.602
Michaela tried for decades
to conjure one up.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.604
It's a spirit form
the Dark Realm

20:05.638 --> 20:07.740
and it hunts its prey
in the darkness.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.276
It‐ it kills anyone that stands
in its way

20:10.309 --> 20:11.410
until it gets what it wants.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.945
It's unstoppable.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.447
It's un‐killable.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.083
So you think that's
what this is?

20:17.116 --> 20:18.784
A Vanator?

20:20.319 --> 20:22.955
Well then there must be
some way to destroy it.

20:22.988 --> 20:23.956
No.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.025
Only the one that summons
it can destroy it.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.861
Well, I don't think the Dark One
is gonna have a change of heart,

20:28.894 --> 20:30.930
so... I don't know.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.432
Like, we‐ we try to outrun it.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.233
Yeah.

20:34.266 --> 20:34.934
Get it to lose our trail.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.902
[thunderous sounds]

20:36.969 --> 20:39.472
We can't outrun it.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.441
It's not gonna be safe out there
until dawn.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.776
Can we keep it out?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.311
I mean, maybe?

20:45.344 --> 20:47.613
I mean, we're gonna try.

20:47.646 --> 20:48.781
We gotta mark our territory.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.616
How?

20:50.649 --> 20:52.451
What does any of this have to do
with The Vanator?

20:52.485 --> 20:54.320
We need to protect ourselves
right now!

20:54.353 --> 20:56.722
We've gotta bind our territory.

20:56.756 --> 21:01.794
A mark a line of blood
in every entrance.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.129
We gotta mark the whole house.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.563
Mira, upstairs.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.767
You take the bedrooms
on the left.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.539
Come on!!!

21:27.987 --> 21:32.758
[whispering voices]

21:36.862 --> 21:39.598
Jack's voice: Violet, come
quickly. I'm here.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.634
Come outside.
We'll be safe.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.837
Jack?

21:49.041 --> 21:49.875
I'm coming.

21:50.609 --> 21:51.577
I'm coming!

21:51.610 --> 21:53.546
Jack, I'm coming.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.450
Jack! Jack! I'm coming!

21:59.585 --> 22:00.986
She left us.

22:01.020 --> 22:01.887
What?

22:01.921 --> 22:03.489
She just walked out.

22:03.522 --> 22:04.857
It's that thing, isn't it?

22:04.890 --> 22:06.659
The Vanator.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.163
Violet!

22:13.766 --> 22:14.934
Violet!

22:16.035 --> 22:17.603
Violet!

22:21.040 --> 22:21.941
Jack!

22:21.974 --> 22:23.609
Jack's voice:
Violet! Come find me.

22:23.642 --> 22:24.844
Jack!

22:24.877 --> 22:26.412
Jack, I'm gonna save you!

22:26.445 --> 22:27.680
Jack's voice: You're close.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.415
Jack!

22:29.448 --> 22:31.717
Tell me where you are!

22:34.787 --> 22:38.157
Ivory: Violet! Violet!

22:38.190 --> 22:39.091
Violet! Violet!!

22:39.124 --> 22:40.893
Vanator: Violet,
we can be whole.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.429
Ivory: Violet! Violet!

22:43.462 --> 22:45.598
But I shouldn't.

22:45.631 --> 22:46.565
Ivory: Violet, no!

22:46.599 --> 22:47.600
I really shouldn't.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.034
Violet, no, no!

22:49.068 --> 22:50.069
Yes.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.036
Close your eyes, Violet.

22:51.070 --> 22:51.937
She must be free.

22:51.971 --> 22:52.905
No!

22:52.938 --> 22:53.772
I will free her.

22:53.806 --> 22:57.443
Violet, Violet don't!

22:57.476 --> 22:58.711
Don't do it!

22:58.744 --> 23:00.613
No!

23:01.146 --> 23:03.148
[gun shots]

23:08.053 --> 23:09.855
This needs to happen.

23:23.903 --> 23:24.937
Ivory.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.145
Violet!

23:37.650 --> 23:39.618
Come on. Come on.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.619
Come on, wake up.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.421
Come on. Come on.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.825
Mira!

23:48.794 --> 23:49.962
Mira!!

23:51.530 --> 23:52.798
Mira!!!

23:52.831 --> 23:54.300
Close your eyes!

23:54.333 --> 23:57.002
Call out to me so I can follow
your voice!

24:00.205 --> 24:01.540
Mira!!!

24:02.007 --> 24:04.009
This way! I'm here!

24:17.022 --> 24:18.023
[banging]

24:25.297 --> 24:26.865
You killed her?

24:27.733 --> 24:29.501
[stammering]
Uh...uh...

24:29.535 --> 24:33.973
I had to. The thing wouldn't
let her go!

24:34.006 --> 24:37.276
What if she's still under
the influence of that thing?

24:40.879 --> 24:42.715
Come on, Violet. Fight.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.049
Fight! Fight!

24:44.083 --> 24:45.551
She could kill us
if you're wrong.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.886
Just shut up, ok?!

24:47.920 --> 24:48.988
[sobbing]
Fight, please.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.957
Come back! Come back!

24:55.027 --> 24:56.228
[gasps]

24:57.029 --> 24:59.732
[catches her breath]

25:10.075 --> 25:11.977
Where's the amulet?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.981
Where is the amulet?

25:23.722 --> 25:26.025
Where ishe

25:30.229 --> 25:32.097
I have it.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.033
Put the gun down.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.803
Is it empty?

25:38.670 --> 25:40.672
Did I open the amulet?

25:41.140 --> 25:43.842
No. Just put the gun down.

25:51.683 --> 25:52.684
Ok.

25:59.758 --> 26:01.994
How are you feeling?

26:02.027 --> 26:05.130
Like I just got stabbed
in the heart.

26:10.135 --> 26:14.206
You looked right at it,
didn't you?

26:14.239 --> 26:16.208
That's how it gets control.

26:16.241 --> 26:21.380
I thought I was talking to Jack.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.782
But it wasn't her.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.118
It got inside my head.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.087
It didn't want you dead.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.190
No, not until I opened
the amulet

26:31.223 --> 26:34.693
and let the darkness get out.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.762
I'm sorry.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.964
For what?

26:38.997 --> 26:40.666
I'm gonna get us killed.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.935
I just know it.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.837
Why would you say something
like that?

26:44.870 --> 26:47.106
Because I don't wanna die, ok?

26:47.139 --> 26:50.242
After what I felt earlier.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.144
What you felt?

26:53.479 --> 26:56.648
Mira, you better tell us.

26:58.283 --> 27:04.990
When that vampire attacked me
upstairs I was so scared.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.158
We're all scared.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.426
This is different.

27:07.459 --> 27:13.265
I'm not used to feeling human
emotions and it overwhelmed me.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.801
But you're a sister.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.069
You've been trained to fight.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.004
I'm not like you, ok?

27:19.037 --> 27:21.974
I was a normal person
with a normal life

27:22.007 --> 27:25.811
and you took that away
from me, Ivory.

27:25.844 --> 27:29.081
When I look at you,
when I close my eyes

27:29.114 --> 27:33.819
and think of what I'm most
afraid of, it's you.

27:33.852 --> 27:34.853
What?

27:36.288 --> 27:40.826
You turned me and you
don't even remember.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.895
You stormed my parents' house.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.797
You and your Sisterhood.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.467
You drank my family dry.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.802
My baby brother.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.305
My real sisters.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.040
My mother.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.981
Mira, I'm sorry I caused you
that pain‐

28:03.015 --> 28:05.717
I know that wasn't you, Ivory,

28:05.751 --> 28:12.024
but when I look at you
all I see is that monster.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.293
[thunderous sound]

28:14.326 --> 28:17.763
It's trying to get past
our defences.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.065
Maybe we should just give it
what it wants

28:20.098 --> 28:21.333
and it will leave us alone.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.901
That will never happen.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.137
What's inside my amulet
is too powerful.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.039
It's not gonna be safe out there
until dawn.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.774
It only hunts at night.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.943
We won't last that long.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.778
Listen, Mira.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.880
I know I'm the reason
why you're here.

28:34.913 --> 28:39.885
I know it's my fault but
you have to listen to us.

28:39.918 --> 28:44.122
Together we're gonna get
through this, ok?

28:44.156 --> 28:45.090
Ok.

28:45.123 --> 28:47.793
We're all exhausted.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.928
We're all scared.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.396
We just stay downstairs
until dawn

28:51.430 --> 28:55.133
and then we'll just get as far
from here as we can.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.468
Ok?

28:58.337 --> 29:00.205
‐Ok.
‐Ok.

29:19.124 --> 29:20.425
Hey, what're you reading?

29:20.459 --> 29:22.127
The history of vampires.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.364
Maybe there's something in here
about beating a Vanator.

29:25.397 --> 29:29.201
You know, it's worth
a shot anyway.

29:29.234 --> 29:32.137
What're you doing?

29:32.170 --> 29:33.305
It's cold.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.140
I'm gonna light a fire.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.990
Mira?

29:52.024 --> 29:57.863
Mira? We're over here.
We need your help.

29:57.896 --> 30:01.166
Have you come back for us?
Help us.

30:01.199 --> 30:04.002
Mira please, we're in here.

30:04.036 --> 30:07.005
Mira, Mira please.

30:09.975 --> 30:16.248
You said that Michaela tried
to conjure a Vanator.

30:16.281 --> 30:18.150
Do you remember anything
about that?

30:18.183 --> 30:22.454
Ivory: It was so long ago,
those memories are kinda hazy.

30:22.487 --> 30:26.358
I'm thinking that
if Michaela knew

30:26.391 --> 30:28.493
then maybe Abraham did, too.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.063
And maybe he put something
in this book.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.102
Mira?

30:38.503 --> 30:42.441
Mira, put down those swords.

30:42.474 --> 30:46.311
She must be whole again.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.348
Ivory, somehow
The Vanator got her.

30:53.218 --> 30:56.888
Give me the amulet.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.258
Get back.

31:00.292 --> 31:04.463
Mira, don't listen to what
it tells you to do.

31:04.496 --> 31:07.065
Don't listen to them.
Help us.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.500
Give it to me.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.503
Mira, I know you're in there.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.206
You need to fight it.

31:14.239 --> 31:15.574
Help us.

31:16.541 --> 31:23.248
[sobs]

31:23.281 --> 31:24.916
I can't.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.487
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.188
Yes, you can.
You can.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.557
I'm so scared.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.259
No, don't be scared.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.061
Fight the fear.

31:36.094 --> 31:40.265
Ivory: Come on, do it.
You can do it.

31:40.298 --> 31:41.967
Listen to us.

31:45.303 --> 31:48.607
Give me the amulet.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.519
Oh, Mira.

32:00.552 --> 32:04.523
I know you're not that monster,
Ivory.

32:07.325 --> 32:09.327
I'm sorry.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.066
No, no, no, no, no, Mira.
Please don't.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.101
Put down the swords.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.469
Mira, please.
Don't do it.

32:17.502 --> 32:20.439

32:29.481 --> 32:41.860
[sobbing]

32:41.893 --> 32:45.997
She did it for us.

32:46.031 --> 32:52.804
She was my last sister
and now it's just me.

32:52.838 --> 32:55.407
I don't deserve
to be the last.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.475
Ivory.

32:56.508 --> 32:59.945
Ivory, don't break now.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.148
We need you, ok?

33:03.181 --> 33:06.318
I don't remember changing her.

33:06.351 --> 33:09.154
It's true.

33:09.187 --> 33:11.490
Because there was so many.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.458
It's not your fault.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.126
It's not.

33:19.564 --> 33:22.467
I was a normal person, too.

33:22.501 --> 33:25.470
I was gonna have a family.

33:25.504 --> 33:29.307
I was gonna give my mother
grandchildren.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.510
This is the Dark One's fault.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.378
All of this.

33:33.411 --> 33:36.214
This shit is what her evil does.

33:40.285 --> 33:46.558
You say that but you
don't really know, Violet.

33:46.591 --> 33:49.494
You've never really felt
the darkness.

33:59.905 --> 34:05.377
Watching my dad try to fight
his darkness and die trying,

34:05.410 --> 34:10.181
seeing the Dark One take control
of Jack, I've felt it.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.349
Believe me.

34:11.383 --> 34:15.053
But you've never felt it
inside of you.

34:15.086 --> 34:19.057
The people that I've drained
and left to rot.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.191
Mira's family?

34:20.225 --> 34:23.595
I don't even remember.

34:23.628 --> 34:28.366
Because the enjoyment
that I felt in killing,

34:28.400 --> 34:34.339
the pleasure that I took
in people's pain.

34:34.372 --> 34:36.575
[sobbing]
That's not who I was before.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.543
It's not who you are now.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.582
Ok? Ok.

[thunderous sounds]

34:45.083 --> 34:46.284
[gasps]

34:49.521 --> 34:51.590
I'm never gonna forget
that darkness.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.159
That despair.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.928
And you're never gonna
understand it.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.066
But I will, though.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.936
I have to, because
this shit ends now.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.406
Wait! No, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

35:08.440 --> 35:09.374
Violet!

35:09.407 --> 35:10.141
Wait, wait.

35:10.175 --> 35:11.076
What're you doing?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.077
Enough hiding.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.246
But The Vanator, it's gonna
make you open it

35:15.280 --> 35:16.281
and then it's gonna kill you.

35:16.314 --> 35:18.149
That's all it knows what to do.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.352
You said that The Vanator
could be stopped

35:20.385 --> 35:21.620
by whoever summoned it,

35:21.653 --> 35:25.490
so if the Dark One summoned it
and this is part of her...

35:28.259 --> 35:30.061
But we don't know that
for certain.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.329
What choice do we have?

35:31.363 --> 35:35.100
We might survive 'til dawn
but what about the next night?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.201
And the next one?

35:36.234 --> 35:40.472
We can't outrun this thing
and we can't even kill it

35:40.505 --> 35:42.474
but the Dark One can
so I find‐

35:42.507 --> 35:44.643
Violet. Don't.

35:44.676 --> 35:49.114
I've never felt the darkness
like you have, you're right.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.248
But I'm a Van Helsing

35:50.281 --> 35:55.487
and it's my duty to resist
and destroy the darkness.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.189
But are you strong enough?

35:58.857 --> 36:00.992
I guess we'll see.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.249
Oh, Violet.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.709
Come to me.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.252
Come to me.

37:35.253 --> 37:39.524
Come, I command thee.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.441
Come, I command thee.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.310
Come to me.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.392
Don't listen to them.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.430
You have served your purpose.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.466
Help me purge the darkness.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.336
The darkness must be purged.

38:58.870 --> 38:59.871
No.

39:01.806 --> 39:03.508
Give it to me.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.276

You did it.

Did what?

39:55.693 --> 39:58.496
The Dark One's still out there.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.832
All I did is buy time.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.901
But it's something.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.903
It has to be.

40:06.804 --> 40:09.974
We've all lost so much.

40:10.008 --> 40:16.481
Jack, Vanessa, your sisters.

40:16.514 --> 40:21.119
That's why we need to end it
once and for all.

40:21.152 --> 40:25.323
I know what you were trapped in
all those years.

40:25.356 --> 40:28.459
Nothing was your fault.

40:28.493 --> 40:31.429
It was all I could do not
to fall off the edge.

40:40.805 --> 40:41.739
What?

40:41.773 --> 40:42.674
What? What'd you find?

40:42.707 --> 40:46.377
It's Jack. It's Jack!

40:46.411 --> 40:47.946
I‐ I've flipped through
this book over and over.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.983
This‐ this definitely
was never here before.

40:52.016 --> 40:57.655
Jack Van Helsing, 2000 ‐ 1778?

40:57.689 --> 40:58.990
Do you think this has
anything to do

40:59.023 --> 41:01.025
with the amulet changing, too?

41:03.094 --> 41:04.729
I don't know.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.832
But if Jack travelled back
in time...

41:07.865 --> 41:09.567
To 1778.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.737
She could have changed
both these things.

41:18.876 --> 41:21.546
‐No way.
‐What?

41:22.580 --> 41:24.682
These numbers. See?

41:24.716 --> 41:25.850
Yeah, what about 'em?

41:25.883 --> 41:28.686
They‐ they look
like coordinates.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.022
She must want us
to go somewhere.

41:31.055 --> 41:33.157
But this is a place
that Jack knew?

41:33.191 --> 41:34.759
It must be.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.595
And these numbers,
they tell you where?

41:37.628 --> 41:43.534
Um... latitude and longitude.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.872
It's on the east coast.

41:47.905 --> 41:53.011
Orientation class was my
favourite and Jack knew that.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.079
I can't believe she's gone.

41:55.113 --> 41:59.550
But she left us a sign,
and we're gonna find it.

You know the darkness now.
