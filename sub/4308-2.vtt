01:08.687 --> 01:12.624
You awake?

01:12.626 --> 01:15.326
Why?

01:15.328 --> 01:18.696
Redneck foreplay.

01:18.698 --> 01:22.166
Hey, baby, you awake?

01:25.403 --> 01:29.005
- Mmm...
- Or, would you like to get awake?

01:29.007 --> 01:31.207
Good and awake?

01:31.209 --> 01:38.247
Mmm... not now.

01:45.222 --> 01:47.257
Aren't you late for work anyway?

01:47.259 --> 01:50.561
Uh-uh.

01:50.563 --> 01:52.629
Took the day off.

01:52.631 --> 01:55.266
Dad's idea.

01:55.268 --> 01:58.102
Taking Daniel to lunch today?

01:58.104 --> 01:59.704
Mmm-hmm.

01:59.706 --> 02:03.608
Going to the Country
Kitchen in Mattsville.

02:03.610 --> 02:05.309
Mattsville?

02:05.311 --> 02:07.211
Everybody be watchin'
us around here.

02:07.213 --> 02:08.812
You know, it's too much of a
statement if we go out to

02:08.815 --> 02:12.683
lunch in Pawley, like we're all of
a sudden buddy-buddy, you know?

02:12.685 --> 02:14.619
Statement?

02:14.621 --> 02:17.055
In everybody's face, you know?

02:17.057 --> 02:18.423
I wanna be a little like Sweden.

02:18.425 --> 02:19.958
Sell goods to both sides.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.128
Honey, shouldn't you
be on his side?

02:23.130 --> 02:25.764
Huh?

02:25.766 --> 02:27.732
Shouldn't you be on his side?

02:27.734 --> 02:28.600
No.

02:28.602 --> 02:34.173
I should be on our side, as in
save the damn business side.

02:34.175 --> 02:36.942
Nobody seems to
understand that but me.

02:46.353 --> 02:49.455
Daniel?

02:51.192 --> 02:53.592
Daniel, honey, we're home.

02:57.864 --> 02:59.165
He's not here.

02:59.167 --> 03:01.500
Oh.

03:03.770 --> 03:07.239
Aren't you even a
little concerned?

03:07.241 --> 03:09.041
Concerned?

03:09.043 --> 03:12.612
He was locked up for 20 years,
mother, and he's been out two days,

03:12.614 --> 03:13.580
and now he's not here.

03:13.582 --> 03:15.281
No note, nothin'.

03:15.283 --> 03:19.319
Well, what do you want me
to do about it, honey?

03:20.956 --> 03:22.922
I don't want you to
do anything, mother.

03:22.924 --> 03:24.590
Just cook.

03:27.361 --> 03:29.362
Hello.

03:29.364 --> 03:32.032
I'll meet ya outside.

03:32.034 --> 03:33.333
It's John.

03:33.335 --> 03:35.469
We're gonna go look for him.

03:40.975 --> 03:44.077
There are people around here,
mom, who wanna see Daniel dead,

03:44.079 --> 03:46.279
people who would do it
themselves, if they thought

03:46.281 --> 03:48.315
they could get away with it.

03:48.317 --> 03:51.818
We should at least get
him a cheap phone.

04:18.012 --> 04:19.712
My mother is driving me crazy.

04:19.714 --> 04:20.880
What's she doing?

04:20.882 --> 04:21.947
Nothing.

04:21.950 --> 04:23.282
Absolutely nothing.

04:23.284 --> 04:24.817
Oh.

04:24.819 --> 04:26.319
Let's go.

04:26.321 --> 04:28.354
Uh, okay.

04:48.409 --> 04:49.776
Hello.

04:49.778 --> 04:52.779
Hello, sir.

06:08.555 --> 06:10.022
Does this work?

06:10.024 --> 06:13.292
Not miracles, I would think.

06:17.298 --> 06:20.699
That'll be $3.16, sir.

06:20.701 --> 06:22.801
Sir?

06:26.874 --> 06:29.074
Four-nineteen.

06:36.917 --> 06:39.418
Thank you, sir.

06:48.211 --> 06:49.939
_

07:56.362 --> 07:57.629
There he is.

07:57.631 --> 08:00.632
Oh, pull over.

08:09.776 --> 08:12.711
What's that like?

08:12.713 --> 08:16.248
I can't imagine.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.783
What's he eatin'?

08:17.785 --> 08:21.687
Looks like a candy
bar or somethin'.

08:39.740 --> 08:42.375
He's just feeling the grass.

08:46.647 --> 08:48.949
This isn't very cool, is it?

08:48.951 --> 08:50.116
Ahem.

08:50.118 --> 08:51.251
Not on our part, no.

08:51.253 --> 08:52.719
Shouldn't we take him home?

08:52.721 --> 08:54.588
I think we should
just leave, you know?

08:54.590 --> 08:56.289
Yeah, but you don't
know this town.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.991
Amantha, we can't follow him
around for the whole day.

08:57.993 --> 09:00.494
I know, but--

09:02.697 --> 09:04.365
No.

09:04.367 --> 09:06.968
No, you're-you're right.

09:10.906 --> 09:12.039
Oh, hey!

09:12.041 --> 09:13.274
Look, it's Daniel!

09:13.276 --> 09:14.542
John just got here!

09:14.544 --> 09:16.111
We'll see ya later!

09:16.113 --> 09:18.380
Ahem.

09:25.056 --> 09:27.190
Hello?

09:27.192 --> 09:29.126
Anybody home?

09:36.768 --> 09:39.470
Hello?

09:44.810 --> 09:47.912
Mom?

09:47.914 --> 09:49.780
Mom?

09:49.782 --> 09:52.549
In here.

09:54.853 --> 09:56.887
Oh, hey.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.923
Hey.

10:00.325 --> 10:02.159
You feeling all right?

10:02.161 --> 10:03.828
Resting.

10:03.830 --> 10:06.831
So, where's everybody else at?

10:06.833 --> 10:09.801
Out.

10:09.803 --> 10:11.836
I was gonna take
Daniel to lunch.

10:11.838 --> 10:13.759
I got here early, so--

10:15.957 --> 10:18.059
That's a sweet gesture, Teddy.

10:18.094 --> 10:19.010
Can I get you something?

10:19.012 --> 10:20.512
Aspirin-- Tums?

10:20.514 --> 10:22.847
No.

10:22.849 --> 10:25.016
No, I'm fine.

10:25.018 --> 10:30.121
- Just--
- Okay.

10:30.123 --> 10:34.359
There's some stuff on the
counter, um, milk and meat.

10:34.361 --> 10:37.128
Should I just put those
things in the fridge?

10:37.130 --> 10:38.530
Yeah.

10:38.532 --> 10:40.432
That'd be nice.

10:40.434 --> 10:42.701
Thank you, Teddy.

10:42.703 --> 10:44.802
Okay, mom.

10:44.804 --> 10:46.237
Uh, sorry.

10:46.239 --> 10:48.373
Janet, I keep forgetting.

10:48.375 --> 10:50.942
Oh, you can call me mom, Teddy.

10:50.944 --> 10:54.845
I think that's all right.

10:54.847 --> 10:57.447
I don't know.

10:57.449 --> 11:01.084
I'll tell you what.

11:01.086 --> 11:03.553
How about when he's around,
I'll call you "Janet,"

11:03.555 --> 11:05.555
and "mom" when he's not?

11:05.557 --> 11:09.459
It'll be our little secret.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.928
I'd like that, Teddy.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.045
You staying the whole week?

11:29.047 --> 11:30.213
Oh, just a few days.

11:30.215 --> 11:31.147
Try to get the DA

11:31.149 --> 11:33.683
to meet with me
while I'm in town.

11:33.685 --> 11:37.421
There's not much to do here
until they make their move.

11:37.423 --> 11:40.090
Justice Row still feel
positive about everything?

11:40.092 --> 11:41.825
Of course.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.894
What about the press conference?

11:43.896 --> 11:47.732
- Well, uh--
- I can take it.

11:47.734 --> 11:49.867
Everyone knows how hard
it must be for Daniel,

11:49.869 --> 11:56.674
- but we were hoping he could
be a little more-- - Normal?

11:56.676 --> 11:58.809
Less esoteric.

11:58.811 --> 12:01.645
Well, he does have a
unique situation.

12:01.647 --> 12:06.583
- So, by definition--
- I know.

12:06.585 --> 12:07.951
We understand.

12:07.953 --> 12:10.553
It's the public I'm worried about.

12:10.555 --> 12:11.821
You know, first impressions.

12:11.823 --> 12:13.823
- He is who he is, John.
- I know.

12:13.825 --> 12:16.493
But, at some point, he's gonna
have to be more proactive.

12:16.495 --> 12:18.528
You know, it wouldn't hurt for
him to declare his innocence

12:18.530 --> 12:19.195
from time to time.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.664
Do we have to talk
about this, right now?

12:21.666 --> 12:23.066
No.

12:23.068 --> 12:24.167
No.

12:24.169 --> 12:27.837
Ahem.

12:27.839 --> 12:29.472
I'm sorry.

12:29.474 --> 12:30.907
I'm sorry.

12:30.909 --> 12:35.445
I just... I just thought
we'd all get some time off

12:35.447 --> 12:37.314
for good behavior.

12:37.316 --> 12:40.717
To gear up so quickly, after
all it took to get him out,

12:40.719 --> 12:45.822
after all that he's been
through, it just seems like

12:45.824 --> 12:48.091
cruel and unusual punishment.

12:50.094 --> 12:55.499
Does a girl have to come
out and say, "hold me?"

12:55.501 --> 12:56.867
Hey.

12:56.869 --> 12:58.068
Hi.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.270
Hi.

13:00.272 --> 13:03.339
I needed this.

13:03.341 --> 13:06.643
There is not a lot of hugging
going on in the nuclear family.

13:06.645 --> 13:07.444
Amantha?

13:07.446 --> 13:09.713
What-- am I smushing your droid?

13:09.715 --> 13:10.915
Amantha?

13:10.917 --> 13:12.616
Amantha, we talked about this.

13:12.618 --> 13:13.951
Uh-uh.

13:13.953 --> 13:15.786
Somebody didn't get the memo.

13:17.456 --> 13:18.689
We had an agreement.

13:18.691 --> 13:19.823
I know.

13:19.825 --> 13:22.059
Hey-hey, this isn't Atlanta,
before the media attention.

13:22.061 --> 13:23.527
The media sucks.

13:23.529 --> 13:29.734
- Oh, God... mmm... mmm...
- Oh... okay.

13:29.736 --> 13:31.602
We never even had an
official last poke.

13:31.604 --> 13:32.837
Oh, no-no-no.

13:32.839 --> 13:34.738
We-we kinda did.

13:36.075 --> 13:37.975
Okay, look.

13:37.977 --> 13:45.116
This will be the official...
official, okay?

13:59.233 --> 14:00.500
Amantha, stop.

14:00.502 --> 14:03.436
Don't turn around.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.944
He's gone.

14:18.652 --> 14:20.987
We are idiots.

14:27.862 --> 14:30.897
Well, wanna get lunch?

14:41.910 --> 14:43.177
Hey, don't be shy.

14:43.179 --> 14:47.749
You can go back for seconds,
thirds, as much as you want here.

14:47.751 --> 14:51.286
People eat more than I recall.

14:51.288 --> 14:52.221
Yeah.

14:52.223 --> 14:54.657
You know, buffets used to just
be for Sundays after church.

14:54.659 --> 14:56.325
Now, it's seven days
a week around here.

14:56.327 --> 14:58.661
Can't even really compete as a
business model without one.

15:03.767 --> 15:07.570
Say, was the Ming Dynasty
around before you went in?

15:07.572 --> 15:08.738
I'm sorry.

15:08.740 --> 15:11.908
Chinese buffet up
on the interstate.

15:11.910 --> 15:12.875
No.

15:12.877 --> 15:16.378
You know, when it first opened, it
was all you could eat for $3.99.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.947
You never seen so many dumb Georgia
crackers descendin' on egg rolls

15:18.949 --> 15:21.783
and sweet and sour chicken
in all your life.

15:21.785 --> 15:23.919
That's interesting.

15:23.921 --> 15:26.922
I guess.

15:28.225 --> 15:29.925
Can we be frank?

15:29.927 --> 15:32.361
I would hope so.

15:32.363 --> 15:36.665
Do you plan on workin'
at the store?

15:36.667 --> 15:39.968
I hadn't really thought
about it, Ted.

15:39.970 --> 15:43.171
Look, my daddy'd kill me, if he knew
we were having this conversation.

15:43.173 --> 15:45.741
He'd just as soon give you the
keys to the store and walk away,

15:45.743 --> 15:47.042
if that's what you wanted.

15:47.044 --> 15:48.543
He's a good man.

15:48.545 --> 15:51.647
And I would, too,
for that matter.

15:53.683 --> 16:00.222
Point is, there are small town
politics involved here with your, uh,

16:00.224 --> 16:02.692
your ongoing situation and all.

16:02.694 --> 16:04.494
You know, some people
have made up their minds

16:04.496 --> 16:07.430
about things, and there's just nothin'
that's ever gonna change 'em.

16:07.432 --> 16:08.998
You know, they're just dug in.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.766
People are funny that way.

16:10.768 --> 16:13.937
But, not "ha-ha" funny.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.938
What?

16:15.940 --> 16:18.107
No.

16:18.109 --> 16:26.549
Anyway, in these uncertain economic
times and tight profit margins,

16:26.551 --> 16:29.685
I mean, I'm just thinking about
Jared's future, primarily.

16:29.687 --> 16:31.053
I see.

16:31.055 --> 16:33.590
It's damn complicated.

16:33.592 --> 16:37.961
Well, I appreciate you sharing
this information with me, Ted.

16:37.963 --> 16:42.599
I'm sure it's a load to carry.

16:42.601 --> 16:43.933
Kinda sensitive, too.

16:43.935 --> 16:46.102
You know what I mean.

16:46.104 --> 16:48.505
I don't talk.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.142
I guess not-- not after
everything you've been through.

16:56.246 --> 16:57.446
You had enough?

16:57.448 --> 16:59.048
Yes, I have.

16:59.050 --> 17:02.150
All right.

17:06.556 --> 17:10.025
Amantha?

17:10.027 --> 17:12.261
Amantha?

17:14.664 --> 17:20.702
We never should've-- I never
should've gotten involved with

17:20.704 --> 17:25.307
- a client's sister, much less--
- No summation now, please.

17:30.579 --> 17:32.346
Well, hey, there.

17:32.348 --> 17:34.516
Long time no see, Amantha.

17:34.518 --> 17:35.984
Been watchin' my figure.

17:35.986 --> 17:37.552
Well, it shows.

17:37.554 --> 17:39.687
So, ya'll want the meat
and three special?

17:39.689 --> 17:41.522
Uh, sure.

17:41.524 --> 17:44.292
I'll just have a piece of pie.

17:44.294 --> 17:45.960
What kind?

17:45.962 --> 17:49.096
Doesn't matter.

17:49.098 --> 17:50.764
I'll surprise you.

17:50.766 --> 17:53.100
Great.

17:56.304 --> 17:59.040
God, I hate this town.

18:02.577 --> 18:05.079
Sure you don't wanna
hit a bucket?

18:05.081 --> 18:07.148
I'd rather watch.

18:07.150 --> 18:09.317
Suit yourself.

18:11.353 --> 18:14.055
Yes, my wife says I'm nosy.

18:14.057 --> 18:17.893
I like to think of myself
more as-as curious.

18:17.895 --> 18:20.395
So, if I happen to cross
some kind of imaginary line

18:20.397 --> 18:23.932
with you, just let me know.

18:23.934 --> 18:26.268
Sure.

18:26.270 --> 18:31.707
So, my buddies said you could have
conjugal visits on death row.

18:31.709 --> 18:36.478
I told 'em it was all BS,
more like an urban legend.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.414
There are no conjugal visits.

18:39.416 --> 18:40.415
I knew it!

18:40.417 --> 18:42.584
You couldn't even touch
another person, right?

18:42.586 --> 18:44.419
No touchin'.

18:44.421 --> 18:48.489
That's gotta work
on your psyche.

18:48.491 --> 18:51.559
You weren't supposed to, anyway.

18:51.561 --> 18:53.962
What do you mean,
wasn't supposed to?

18:53.964 --> 18:57.065
Things were a lot different
when I was first incarcerated.

18:57.067 --> 19:01.336
A certain element of guards
were less supervised.

19:01.338 --> 19:06.108
So, it, uh, created an
environment for things to occur.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.577
Things-- what-what, uh,
what kinda things?

19:08.579 --> 19:10.679
Encounters, I guess.

19:10.681 --> 19:15.317
Well, not by chance, more
like an initiation of sorts.

19:15.319 --> 19:17.285
Initiation?

19:17.287 --> 19:20.055
Yeah.

19:20.057 --> 19:22.992
Maybe it was when they first saw
somethin' akin to optimism

19:22.994 --> 19:27.697
on your face, or a bit of peace,
or just that moment when

19:27.699 --> 19:33.369
you began to believe that...
you could survive it

19:33.371 --> 19:36.438
in some paradoxical way.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.308
I don't know why they did it.

19:39.310 --> 19:43.980
Justification's a
slippery slope, Ted.

19:43.982 --> 19:47.817
So, one mornin', you go off
for your weekly shower,

19:47.819 --> 19:51.454
and this group of inmates
with particular compulsions

19:51.456 --> 19:54.291
suddenly appear.

19:54.293 --> 19:57.862
You understand at once why
they're there, but there's

19:57.864 --> 19:59.797
nothin' you can do about it.

19:59.799 --> 20:04.101
You can fight it, some symbolic
gesture to your manhood,

20:04.103 --> 20:06.903
but you can't stop it.

20:06.905 --> 20:13.076
So, it happens... repeatedly.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.681
Shit.

20:17.683 --> 20:20.750
But then, it's over.

20:20.752 --> 20:25.122
Just as quickly as they
appeared, they're gone.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.624
It's the strangest thing, Ted.

20:27.626 --> 20:28.792
There you are, alone again.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.128
The water's still runnin'.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.230
The guards reappear
like they never left.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.231
Maybe they didn't.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.267
I don't know now.

20:37.269 --> 20:42.039
So, you finish your
shower and get dressed.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.775
Word gets back before you do.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.444
Decent guys on the row
won't look at you now.

20:47.446 --> 20:51.248
They're too embarrassed for ya.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.951
Then, there are the ones who,
when you pass by their cells,

20:53.953 --> 20:56.320
they look at you with the
basest form of curiosity,

20:56.322 --> 20:59.857
Ted, like you were some
freak show, and they wanna

20:59.859 --> 21:02.993
get all their money's worth
because, more than anything,

21:02.995 --> 21:07.031
they're aroused
by another shame.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.767
You know?

21:09.769 --> 21:13.103
Then, there's a very special group
on the row who look at you

21:13.105 --> 21:16.907
with this look, like-- how
can I describe it for ya,

21:16.909 --> 21:22.746
Ted, so you can
really understand it?

21:22.748 --> 21:25.282
It's like they can pull you
into their cell and not just

21:25.284 --> 21:33.724
do things to ya, but literally
consume you, take your breath,

21:33.726 --> 21:39.864
eat your heart, and shit you
out like you were nothin'.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.738
I'm sorry.

21:49.675 --> 21:54.245
I'm sure that was more
than you were-- ahem.

21:57.816 --> 22:04.521
But, it is difficult to
gauge things in this world.

22:04.523 --> 22:10.894
And like you, I suppose, hard
to know where the lines are.

22:13.698 --> 22:16.433
Anyway--

22:45.164 --> 22:46.665
I don't know how he got in.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.700
You need to get that little
son of a bitch some action.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.768
He's frustrated.

22:49.770 --> 22:50.836
I don't see how.

22:50.838 --> 22:52.838
I castrated him.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.840
Then, he's pissed off, 24/7.

22:54.842 --> 22:56.041
Awe.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.643
Most of the time, he's sweet.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.612
He's sweet.

23:00.614 --> 23:02.881
Just here for a
quickie, Senator?

23:02.883 --> 23:09.153
Marcy, you need to go easy
on the flirting at the cafe.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.521
I flirt with everybody.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.090
Sheriff's suspicious.

23:12.092 --> 23:13.491
Isn't that his job?

23:13.493 --> 23:15.394
Marcy.

23:15.396 --> 23:18.831
If I stop flirting, won't it
make him more suspicious?

23:18.833 --> 23:21.900
You are way too damn
smart to be a waitress.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.936
Life isn't fair.

23:33.448 --> 23:36.550
Guess who came in
for lunch today.

23:36.552 --> 23:38.652
I don't know, Marcy.

23:38.654 --> 23:41.153
The ghost of Strom Thurmond?

23:41.155 --> 23:43.656
No-- that was last week.

23:43.658 --> 23:46.626
Amantha Holden and her
lawyer from Atlanta.

23:46.628 --> 23:49.729
Yeah, I heard he landed.

23:49.731 --> 23:54.233
Did your other source tell you
that they were doin' the nasty?

23:57.737 --> 23:58.904
How do you know that?

23:58.906 --> 24:00.973
'Cause there's a special kind
of mad that a girl gets

24:00.975 --> 24:03.276
with a boy who's diddlin' her.

24:07.616 --> 24:09.782
Is that good news
for the home team?

24:09.784 --> 24:14.520
Well, I don't know yet, but I sure
don't see how it could hurt us.

24:16.490 --> 24:19.125
I didn't have time
to stop for flowers.

24:19.127 --> 24:21.294
Well, it's the
thought that counts.

24:21.296 --> 24:23.496
Oh-- mmm.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.776
How'd you get inside?

24:46.050 --> 24:48.185
Hi.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.921
Let's go.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.723
He did it.

24:53.725 --> 24:55.058
What?

24:55.060 --> 24:56.560
I believe he did it.

24:56.562 --> 24:59.330
Maybe he wasn't alone, but
he was damn sure in on it.

24:59.332 --> 25:01.733
What makes you so sure?

25:01.735 --> 25:04.669
Oh, hell, I don't know.
I'm just runnin' my mouth.

25:04.671 --> 25:07.138
Well, you can't just come
in out of the blue and say

25:07.140 --> 25:08.039
somethin' like that, Teddy.

25:08.041 --> 25:10.709
- I mean-- goodness!
- I know... I know.

25:10.711 --> 25:12.777
- I mean, really.
- I know, Tawney!

25:12.779 --> 25:16.482
Damn-- I'm just blowin'
off some steam!

25:19.319 --> 25:20.252
Well, what happened?

25:20.254 --> 25:22.288
Did somethin'-- did
somethin' happen today?

25:22.290 --> 25:24.857
Nothin' I can put my finger on.

25:24.859 --> 25:26.325
He's just a weird guy.

25:26.327 --> 25:28.694
- Oh, Teddy, good grief.
- I know.

25:28.696 --> 25:30.829
Who wouldn't be weird?
All right, I get it.

25:30.831 --> 25:38.102
But, when we was at lunch, I just
got a really bad feelin' from him.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.939
I gotta share my
feelings with somebody.

25:40.941 --> 25:43.275
It's not like I can go sharing
my inner feelings about this

25:43.277 --> 25:46.244
down at the Masonic Lodge.

25:46.246 --> 25:49.080
No.

25:49.082 --> 25:51.817
I-I'm glad you share with me.

25:58.192 --> 26:00.293
You wanna pray about it?

26:00.295 --> 26:01.227
What?

26:01.229 --> 26:05.298
Just about everything that's going
on in our lives, right now.

26:05.300 --> 26:08.134
I don't wanna pray about
everything, Tawney, especially

26:08.136 --> 26:10.670
not about him and his shit.

26:20.937 --> 26:22.638
How's it lookin', Ted?

26:22.640 --> 26:25.574
Secret is to make everybody so
hungry, they'll eat anything.

26:25.576 --> 26:26.676
That's not true.

26:26.678 --> 26:31.047
Big Ted is the best
cook in the family.

26:31.049 --> 26:34.750
I guess this could take a
long time, couldn't it?

26:34.752 --> 26:35.918
It could.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.953
Time is money.

26:36.955 --> 26:38.955
Well, not so much
for the government.

26:38.957 --> 26:39.989
They get paid either way.

26:39.991 --> 26:41.858
Hmm.

26:41.860 --> 26:46.195
Jared is gonna, you know, need some
things over the next few years.

26:46.197 --> 26:47.330
College looming.

26:47.332 --> 26:48.531
Of course.

26:48.533 --> 26:53.036
I guess, what I wanna know is, are
you gonna be backin' us, John?

26:53.038 --> 26:56.673
To bet honest with you, Ted,
that's Justice Row's call.

26:56.675 --> 27:01.478
But, they're very
positive, so far.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.081
Think there's a chance in hell
they'd just cut it loose?

27:05.083 --> 27:07.950
You know, just let him go?

27:07.952 --> 27:13.355
If it's in their best interest,
politically and otherwise,

27:13.357 --> 27:15.191
anything's possible.

27:15.193 --> 27:17.093
I'm the one person around
here you don't need

27:17.095 --> 27:20.863
to sugarcoat things for.

27:20.865 --> 27:23.399
Anything is possible, Ted.

27:23.401 --> 27:25.968
But, I'd be real surprised,
if they let it go.

27:25.970 --> 27:31.774
And they could stretch it out
for years, if it suited them.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.510
Ahem.

27:34.512 --> 27:36.812
Uh, didn't we just eat?

27:36.814 --> 27:39.115
That was two hours ago,
which around here is like

27:39.117 --> 27:41.050
eight hours in dog years.

27:41.052 --> 27:44.353
Oh.

27:44.355 --> 27:47.623
Well, if it isn't
Teddy and Tawney.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.158
Hi-- we-we brought cupcakes.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.193
That's nice.

27:50.195 --> 27:52.328
And some beer.
Is that all right?

27:52.330 --> 27:56.132
Long as you promise
not to shotgun 'em.

27:56.134 --> 27:58.866
Well, you know, I am a pork
eater, just for the record.

27:58.971 --> 28:01.138
I just do what I'm told.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.774
I've been known to cook up
some baby back ribs myself.

28:03.776 --> 28:05.909
Oh, be careful now.

28:05.911 --> 28:07.611
First, you're eatin'
a pork sandwich.

28:07.613 --> 28:09.579
Next thing you know, you're
drinkin' the blood of Jesus.

28:09.581 --> 28:10.614
Teddy!

28:10.616 --> 28:12.850
I'm just kiddin' with him.

28:16.554 --> 28:18.522
Your turn.

28:20.825 --> 28:25.029
Hey, uh, I'm runnin' to the store.
I'll be right back.

28:40.079 --> 28:42.347
Mom?

28:42.349 --> 28:44.082
Everything's ready.

28:44.084 --> 28:47.018
Great.

28:47.020 --> 28:48.720
Mom?

28:48.722 --> 28:51.257
Yes, Amantha?

28:51.259 --> 28:54.727
I don't know.

28:54.729 --> 28:57.230
Can I get somethin'?

28:57.232 --> 28:59.299
The slaw.

28:59.301 --> 29:01.802
Okay.

29:20.288 --> 29:23.023
Hey, Danny, boy!

29:23.025 --> 29:25.192
Whoo!

29:25.194 --> 29:27.461
Top of the mornin' to ya.

29:27.463 --> 29:31.765
Ah... I know you're
awake, Danny.

29:31.767 --> 29:35.236
Ah... you're always awake.

29:35.238 --> 29:37.705
You know, you'd think you'd
get tired of making pancake

29:37.707 --> 29:42.776
batter to the same
memory, year after year.

29:42.778 --> 29:45.345
Ain't happened yet.

29:48.783 --> 29:50.050
Okay.

29:50.052 --> 29:52.785
So, uh, if you didn't strangle
the life out of our sweet

29:52.787 --> 29:57.557
Hannah, what do you
bust a load to, huh?

29:57.559 --> 30:00.960
Memories of ice cream?

30:00.962 --> 30:03.296
Prom?

30:04.932 --> 30:10.870
Ugh... mmm... maybe you
just get the shivers

30:10.872 --> 30:14.807
from me gettin' the shivers.

30:14.809 --> 30:17.710
Maybe that's all you got.

30:25.485 --> 30:28.221
Why are we the only ones
cleaning up, again?

30:28.223 --> 30:30.056
It's the 1950's, Amantha.

30:30.058 --> 30:32.191
You just don't know it.

30:32.193 --> 30:34.227
Them were some damn
fine ribs, daddy.

30:34.229 --> 30:35.428
Thank you, Teddy.

30:35.430 --> 30:36.663
Yeah-- sure were, pop.

30:36.665 --> 30:38.731
You only ate one there, boy.

30:38.733 --> 30:39.599
That's all I wanted.

30:39.601 --> 30:41.968
You ain't going vegan on
us now, are ya, Jared?

30:41.970 --> 30:43.703
No.

30:43.705 --> 30:46.873
Hey, there's not anything
else planned, is there?

30:46.875 --> 30:48.874
I'm gonna have to
scoot in a minute.

30:48.876 --> 30:50.376
Planned-- like what?

30:50.378 --> 30:51.844
I don't know.

30:51.846 --> 30:54.180
Like a plaque presentation?

30:54.182 --> 30:56.515
I don't know, Amantha.
That's why I'm asking.

30:56.517 --> 30:57.816
No.

30:57.818 --> 30:58.918
The pie was it.

30:58.920 --> 31:03.223
Oh, speaking of, that was
excellent pie, Janet.

31:03.225 --> 31:04.924
Thank you, Teddy.

31:04.926 --> 31:07.327
Oh, let me get that.

31:07.329 --> 31:08.929
Thank you.

31:08.931 --> 31:10.998
Hey, you wanna go ahead
and, uh, grab your stuff?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.233
I'll be right back.

31:22.310 --> 31:24.044
Hello.

31:24.046 --> 31:25.712
Hello.

31:25.714 --> 31:29.849
I'm sorry I haven't
said more to you.

31:29.851 --> 31:32.185
I guess I was afraid.

31:32.187 --> 31:36.456
Not of you-- I just didn't
know what to say, exactly.

31:36.458 --> 31:40.093
I understand.

31:40.095 --> 31:44.564
But, I'm glad you're here, home.

31:44.566 --> 31:47.134
Thank you.

31:47.136 --> 31:50.103
I-I'm glad, too.

31:50.105 --> 31:53.473
Please, take a seat,
if you'd like.

32:02.116 --> 32:05.785
Sure is a beautiful day.

32:05.787 --> 32:11.024
It, um, has lots of colors.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.829
Do you have, like, a-a
favorite season, Daniel?

32:15.831 --> 32:19.233
A favorite season?

32:19.235 --> 32:22.970
Personally, I like
the fall a lot.

32:22.972 --> 32:27.241
But also, I love it when it
rains on a hot summer day,

32:27.243 --> 32:31.245
even though that's
technically not a season.

32:33.382 --> 32:39.120
What is it that you love about
rain on a hot summer's day?

32:39.122 --> 32:46.094
I don't know... calms me down.

32:46.096 --> 32:49.764
Makes the plants happy.

32:49.766 --> 32:53.935
And the thunder,
I love the thunder.

32:53.937 --> 33:00.274
It makes me think of God,
but not in a bad way.

33:00.276 --> 33:02.976
What is it?

33:02.978 --> 33:07.380
I'm just so aware that most of what
I draw on from inside my head

33:07.382 --> 33:10.316
are things I've read about.

33:10.318 --> 33:15.722
My real life experiences are
actually rather narrow.

33:15.724 --> 33:23.563
I don't think about the seasons,
not for the longest time anyway.

33:23.565 --> 33:25.232
I'm sorry.

33:25.234 --> 33:27.100
I don't mean to sound pitiful.

33:27.102 --> 33:29.302
No, oh, no, you
don't, not really.

33:29.304 --> 33:32.539
I don't feel that way--
sorry for myself.

33:32.541 --> 33:39.313
I do feel I am being received
sometimes that way by others.

33:39.315 --> 33:41.916
And I know I have a
part in that somehow.

33:41.918 --> 33:46.520
I just don't have
it figured out yet.

33:46.522 --> 33:51.559
That'll probably take some
time-- figurin' things out.

33:57.433 --> 34:00.568
What is it?

34:00.570 --> 34:04.172
The place where I
was had no windows.

34:04.174 --> 34:07.609
Just these thick walls
surrounded by more thick walls.

34:07.611 --> 34:13.716
So, I never knew if it was rainin'
or even heard the loudest thunder.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.650
It's so sad.

34:15.652 --> 34:20.757
Oh, it's-it's not as bad as it
sounds, because I-I didn't sense

34:20.759 --> 34:22.458
things in a normal way.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.626
I didn't miss them.

34:23.628 --> 34:33.870
If-if I couldn't sense them,
I-I-- they weren't real to me.

34:33.871 --> 34:40.043
What was real to you, Daniel?

34:40.045 --> 34:42.712
The time in between the seconds.

34:46.684 --> 34:53.590
And my books...
and my friend.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.393
Now that I'm here in this
world, where everything's

34:56.395 --> 35:03.100
marked by hours, or dates, or events,
I find myself in a state of

35:03.102 --> 35:05.069
constant anticipation.

35:05.071 --> 35:08.572
What it is I'm anticipatin',
I'm not always sure,

35:08.574 --> 35:13.477
nor is it necessarily
a pleasant feelin'.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.747
But, in the case of the
inevitable rain and thunder,

35:16.749 --> 35:23.455
which I am sure to experience,
thanks to you, Tawney,

35:23.457 --> 35:27.258
I am very much looking
forward to that.

35:27.260 --> 35:32.230
It will be glorious, Daniel.

35:32.232 --> 35:34.632
You won't be disappointed.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.545
Daniel?

35:47.547 --> 35:53.450
We'll have more conversations.

35:53.452 --> 35:56.053
I look forward to that.

36:00.558 --> 36:01.491
It's time to go?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.026
Yeah.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.762
Okay.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.165
I'll meet you out in the car.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.700
Okay.

36:13.037 --> 36:14.503
Uh, listen.

36:14.505 --> 36:17.373
All that stuff you told me today
after lunch, I don't know if you was

36:17.375 --> 36:18.741
pulling my leg or not.

36:18.743 --> 36:21.443
Why would I pull your leg, Ted?

36:21.445 --> 36:22.577
I don't know.

36:22.579 --> 36:24.579
Like a game?

36:24.581 --> 36:25.613
No.

36:25.615 --> 36:28.549
Do you play games, Ted?

36:28.551 --> 36:32.620
It's just not a
world I understand.

36:32.622 --> 36:38.959
Anyway, um, well, this may be
stupid of me, or crass, but, uh,

36:38.961 --> 36:41.896
I got you a little eye candy.

36:41.898 --> 36:44.131
A little somethin' to help
you, uh, you know, transition

36:44.133 --> 36:45.933
into the outside world.

36:45.935 --> 36:48.236
You know, get your mind right.

37:04.124 --> 37:06.525
What was you and star
man talkin' about?

37:06.527 --> 37:08.493
The weather.

37:08.495 --> 37:10.195
On Mars?

37:10.197 --> 37:11.129
No.

37:11.131 --> 37:15.801
You know, he didn't even hear
thunder while he was in there.

37:15.803 --> 37:17.469
Didn't even have a window.

37:17.471 --> 37:18.904
Darlin', he was on death row.

37:18.906 --> 37:21.140
He's not guaranteed a view.

37:21.142 --> 37:21.740
I know.

37:21.742 --> 37:24.477
It just seemed-- I don't know.

37:24.479 --> 37:26.479
What'd ya'll talk about?

37:26.481 --> 37:29.649
Nothin'.

37:29.651 --> 37:32.418
I just gave him a
homecoming gift.

37:32.420 --> 37:35.354
You did-- what?

37:35.356 --> 37:37.222
Dirty magazine.

37:37.224 --> 37:39.091
You did not!

37:39.093 --> 37:41.193
Why not?

37:41.195 --> 37:42.361
I don't know.

37:42.363 --> 37:44.729
Just seems tacky or somethin'.

37:44.731 --> 37:48.567
Hey, he doesn't have a wife or
girlfriend to come home to.

37:48.569 --> 37:50.335
He needs some kind of release.

37:50.337 --> 37:51.936
Maybe if he chokes that
chicken a few hundred times,

37:51.938 --> 37:53.371
he won't be so weird acting.

37:53.373 --> 37:56.607
You keep saying he's weird,
but, you know, I don't--

37:56.609 --> 37:58.676
I don't see it that way, really.

37:58.678 --> 38:01.646
Oh, he's weird.

38:01.648 --> 38:02.513
Goodness!

38:02.515 --> 38:05.083
You've been lookin' at me?

38:05.085 --> 38:08.053
Yeah, I've been lookin' at ya.

38:08.055 --> 38:09.387
You're my wife.

38:09.389 --> 38:12.057
Can't I look at ya?

38:12.059 --> 38:14.159
Yeah, yeah.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.795
I just-I just didn't-- I didn't
know you were lookin' at me.

38:16.797 --> 38:19.698
Well, I tried to turn away,
but you're just so beautiful.

38:19.700 --> 38:22.100
I couldn't take my
eyes off of you.

38:22.102 --> 38:27.205
Well, thank you, Teddy.

38:27.207 --> 38:29.574
Why are you still covered up?

38:29.576 --> 38:30.241
I don't know.

38:30.243 --> 38:34.512
Um, 'cause I just-I just-- I didn't
know you were lookin' at me.

38:34.514 --> 38:37.749
And, you know, I-I was just
planning on taking bath,

38:37.751 --> 38:40.919
and I didn't expect you to
come in on me like this.

38:40.921 --> 38:46.492
And, um, I'm a
little embarrassed.

38:46.494 --> 38:48.761
Why?

38:48.763 --> 38:50.496
It isn't a sin.

38:50.498 --> 38:51.731
We're man and wife.

38:51.733 --> 38:54.633
I know.

38:54.635 --> 38:56.502
Let me see ya.

39:02.110 --> 39:02.843
Come on, Tawney.

39:02.845 --> 39:05.212
Let Teddy have a little peek.

39:26.368 --> 39:27.969
Okay.

39:27.971 --> 39:29.103
You've had your look.

39:29.105 --> 39:33.807
Now, can I take my bath?

39:33.809 --> 39:39.680
Yeah, sure-- if
that's what you want.

39:39.682 --> 39:42.315
It is, if you wouldn't mind.

39:50.325 --> 39:57.197
You know, we haven't made
love since Daniel got out.

39:57.199 --> 39:59.333
So?

39:59.335 --> 40:01.835
Maybe it's just coincidence.

40:01.837 --> 40:03.403
What do you mean?

40:03.405 --> 40:06.306
I don't know.

40:06.308 --> 40:10.144
I thought maybe you had some
kinda-kind of big crush

40:10.146 --> 40:12.613
on him or somethin'.

40:12.615 --> 40:15.082
Don't be silly.

40:15.084 --> 40:21.522
I'm offended you would
even suggest that.

40:21.524 --> 40:25.392
I'm sorry.

40:25.394 --> 40:27.862
You know I get a little
insecure sometimes.

40:35.169 --> 40:37.003
