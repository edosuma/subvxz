WEBVTT

00:09.480 --> 00:11.600
"Redback" is the code name

00:11.680 --> 00:15.000
for a major terror attack
on British soil.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.560
<i>Alexander Kutiev was bugged.</i>

00:17.480 --> 00:19.120
This was in his flat.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.920
I will throw the bottle.
Everyone will die.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.520
<i>Evacuate the building.</i>

00:25.600 --> 00:26.640
Don't open the doors!

00:26.720 --> 00:28.680
-Did you apply for Glen's job?
-No.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.280
What are you two talking about?

00:30.360 --> 00:33.240
Adam is going to give the Scots
their referendum.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.600
Comms got a flag
from Rieper Hansen, in Denmark.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.680
The head of Cybersecurity's
gone AWOL.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.200
He's disappeared

00:40.280 --> 00:42.960
and stolen a process
for the creation of biofuels.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.600
-Where's Torben?
-Who the hell are you?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.760
-Get off!
-IC, one male.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.440
Assumed armed with nerve agent.
It's the bastard who killed Glen.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.080
He almost beat her to death.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.320
Think it might've been a play?

00:55.400 --> 00:58.160
I'll call doctor Hassan.
See how she reacts to hyoscine.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.560
I'm not doing it.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.360
If this terror attack
Kutiev has warned us goes ahead,

01:02.440 --> 01:03.720
you'll wish to God you had.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.920
Torben?

01:18.040 --> 01:18.920
Get off!

01:21.880 --> 01:22.920
<i>Where is he?</i>

01:24.480 --> 01:25.840
<i>I don't know!</i>

01:26.280 --> 01:28.320
<i>Where is he?</i>

01:29.480 --> 01:31.360
<i>On the fucking floor!</i>

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
<i>Come on. Radio check.</i>

01:32.520 --> 01:35.360
<i>One IC, one female</i>
<i>in and out of consciousness.</i>

01:35.440 --> 01:38.040
<i>Ambulance called.</i>
<i>You let that go on too long.</i>

01:38.720 --> 01:39.920
<i>Is she gonna live?</i>

01:41.600 --> 01:42.480
<i>Yes.</i>

02:47.360 --> 02:49.480
HEADQUARTERS

02:49.560 --> 02:51.920
Katrine Poulsen's condition
is listed as "stable".

02:52.000 --> 02:54.040
No new information on Torben Jensen.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.840
Our number one priority
is to find this guy,

02:58.440 --> 03:01.600
a man capable of causing carnage
with chemical weapons

03:02.280 --> 03:03.920
and almost beating a woman to death.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.320
-Thirty seconds.
-Have the cash ready.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.600
He's our link.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.840
He wants to find Torben
as much as we do.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.120
So if we find him, we find Torben.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.800
We find him, we've got Glen's killer.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.520
We find him, we get Redback.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.760
So find him.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.760
-Lose the hat, Sherlock.
-Yes, ma'am.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.080
Forty-three seconds.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.440
She's not as myopic as people think.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.480
Only a fool would bet against her.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.280
Check with the other desk,

03:34.360 --> 03:36.440
make sure they're not seeing
on the target's photo.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.040
A man who can get a nerve agent
doesn't just arrive on thin air.

03:39.120 --> 03:39.920
Sure.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.880
William.
I apologise for keeping you waiting.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.560
-Prime Minister.
-I'm afraid I have a few minutes.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.680
I'll go straight to the point.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.760
It's my opinion
that rather than risking the Union,

04:04.840 --> 04:06.400
that you should cancel
the referendum.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.760
Yes, I won't be doing that.

04:11.680 --> 04:12.600
Meeting over.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.000
Prime Minister, we're in a new game.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.360
We didn't devise the rules.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.680
Russia did.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.400
What makes you think you can win?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.280
The polls.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.400
The polls.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.600
Forget the polls.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.920
They take no account
for what you're up against.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.320
Russia is adept at undermining
and controlling small states.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.320
Creating one in Scotland
would be a coup

04:36.400 --> 04:38.280
and they would do everything
in their power

04:38.360 --> 04:40.040
to get the result that they want.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.040
Well.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.760
I have every confidence

04:46.840 --> 04:49.480
that your department
is more than capable of handling it.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.600
I'm so sorry, I do have to go.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.080
Forty-three seconds, bang on.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.560
Never gamble on an Ogilvy
when pride's on the line.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.600
-Declan was in on it?
-Of course.

05:07.040 --> 05:07.840
What's up?

05:07.920 --> 05:09.800
I'm going to interview
Katrine Poulsen again.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.680
After what happened,
she might be more cooperative.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.400
Did William say anything to you about

05:16.400 --> 05:17.480
Glen's replacement?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.640
That's what you're thinking about
right now?

05:22.720 --> 05:23.960
-The job's yours.
-Don't.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.160
I believe I'll convince Scotland

05:29.240 --> 05:31.480
that going in alone
is not in their best interest.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.080
How are you going to do that?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.240
I'll knock on every door
if I have to.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.040
You're gonna go
and knock on every door?

05:37.560 --> 05:40.440
Because if not, your no lies approach
just started with a big one.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.320
If you don't vamoose,

05:41.400 --> 05:43.360
the Israelis are gonna go home
very pissed.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.400
-I'm going.
-I need a favor.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.120
If I have to stop walking,
I think Nikki would implode.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.440
Holly wants to see me.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.760
Shit.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.800
Can I talk you out of it?

05:56.920 --> 05:57.720
No.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.440
Nikki's got a flat she never goes to,
because we work her so hard.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.720
I don't want any of my team.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.760
This has to be off-off books.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.640
The DPS will go bat-shit crazy.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.800
You're not Margaret Thatcher.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.920
The PM can't go walkabout
without security.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.240
-Keys.
-Thanks.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.200
Thanks. Fine.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.240
Yes, I'm going.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.640
Hi, Leanne.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.160
I have a private meeting
this afternoon.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.800
I need to organise new security.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.800
I read that report
into William Ogilvy's daughter.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.600
Can you find out if she's available?

06:43.480 --> 06:44.440
Great, thanks.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.800
Thanks.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.240
You need to answer some questions.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.000
How long were you watching me
getting beaten up?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.920
Police on the scene
said you let it go too long.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.360
He was trying to get information
that we needed.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.480
How many more times?

07:18.560 --> 07:21.360
I don't know where Torben is.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.360
Do you know that I'm pregnant?

07:31.800 --> 07:32.640
Why didn't you say?

07:33.240 --> 07:34.040
How is it?

07:34.600 --> 07:35.640
The baby?

07:35.720 --> 07:36.880
Piss off.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.640
Look the man who attacked you
knew where to find you.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.600
OK? We can keep you
and the baby safe.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.480
Yeah.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.560
You really have
my best interests at heart.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.640
Where are you going?

07:56.040 --> 07:56.840
Torben?

07:57.560 --> 07:58.880
She doesn't leave this room.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.560
What, you lost him?

08:21.560 --> 08:22.760
Now we have nothing!

08:23.400 --> 08:25.080
Get changed. You're coming with me.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
Are you okay?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.360
I'm bringing Poulsen in.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.080
We both know you can't arrest me.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.560
If you wanna help the case,
just stay here.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.880
...every floor, every outdoor space,
ambulance bays, car parks.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.720
Get a warrant. Whatever it takes!

09:13.520 --> 09:15.000
I wanna know where Torben went.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.720
-How's Marcus?
-He's getting his nose reset.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.400
He's gonna bitch about this
for weeks.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.520
So, Katrine.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.760
How did Torben know
where to find her?

09:25.840 --> 09:26.640
Are they in contact?

09:27.360 --> 09:28.800
I'll interview her again.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.600
Here.
Prime Minister's secretary called.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.680
-Needs you on a job.
-I'm busy.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.560
William okayed it.

09:38.080 --> 09:38.880
God.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.080
I'll handle our Danish friend.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.880
Just let her stew for a while.
Impatience is her weak spot.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.040
Beatrice...

09:54.840 --> 09:55.720
Your mentor.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.480
His Civil Honor.
He'd want you to have it.

09:58.080 --> 09:58.960
Spare me.

11:13.160 --> 11:13.960
Yeah?

11:15.360 --> 11:18.280
Just heard back
from the data vampires downstairs.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.000
They went eight levels deep
on the Torben account.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.800
This was in a Cayman account
for 35 seconds and then it was gone.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.840
Do we still think
the man at the hospital was Torben?

11:27.920 --> 11:29.640
Looks like him, but it wasn't.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.320
Say Poulsen made a mistake.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.800
So, why'd he run?

11:32.880 --> 11:34.360
Caught sight of Beatrice, perhaps.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.360
He wouldn't be the first man
to run a mile.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.080
That's a joke.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.680
I spoke to her earlier today.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.160
She still doesn't know.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.520
Know what?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
About Glen's job.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.640
Well, she soon will.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.800
Could you have Marcus step in?

11:51.880 --> 11:53.680
Marcus is still at the hospital.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.200
So, who's that?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.120
So, you're telling me
that I can't walk back?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.840
Can't let you through
without your pass.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.920
I work here, mate.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.000
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.640
Miss Poulsen.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.880
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,
but Mr. Ogilvy will see you now.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.880
We'll have all four nations' cameras
pointed at us.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.560
If he doesn't share
a platform with me,

13:24.640 --> 13:25.920
then how's that gonna look?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.320
Either we're united
in this "no campaign",

13:28.400 --> 13:30.840
or he's putting his personal views
above his party.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.480
Find out when he can meet
because this needs sorting.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.560
Thanks, Leanne.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.240
I'm out of commission
for the next hour.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.360
Emergencies only.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.520
No, I'll be back for that.
See you later.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.120
Thank you for agreeing to this.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.680
Well, it's my father
you should thank.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.120
I don't know what this is.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.400
You'll give a speech for him tonight?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.680
-It was supposed to be Glen.
-Whitelaw.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.720
His idea. Mark my father's 30 years
in the service.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.320
Well, he's a remarkable man.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.720
Yes. When they broke the mould,
they made him.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.240
Do you know what you're going to say?

14:36.920 --> 14:38.280
Working with your father.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.400
Do you worry it puts a strain
on your relationship?

14:43.960 --> 14:46.880
Well, I figured I'd see more of him
if I went into the service.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.640
And having a

14:50.920 --> 14:54.160
powerful, strong-minded man
for your father...

14:55.400 --> 14:56.600
Is that a help?

14:58.120 --> 14:59.280
Or a hindrance?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.400
May I ask where this is going,
Prime Minister?

15:05.320 --> 15:06.920
Up a blind alley, clearly.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.240
I'm sorry. As you were.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.800
My father treats everyone
according to merit.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.320
No help. No hindrance.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.120
What can we expect in there?

15:21.600 --> 15:23.760
It's a private meeting.
Just me and one other.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.320
-Male? Female?
-A woman, yes.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.240
The flat's owned
by one of our political advisers.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.520
And no one knows you're coming here?

15:34.080 --> 15:36.000
Until a couple of hours ago,
neither did I.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.240
You wait here.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.520
My meeting's already arrived.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.440
Don't scare her.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.720
Copy that.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.000
-All clear?
-Yes.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.600
All clear. Bring him in.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
I don't mind.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.560
No, I couldn't.
It's a public building.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.920
I didn't think
you'd care about rules.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.440
I obey all the rules
that are insignificant.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.280
It's good karma for the ones I break.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.880
Care to tell me what you were doing
running rampant in my back yard?

17:28.960 --> 17:33.160
There wasn't much back and forth
between our agencies, so I...

17:33.680 --> 17:35.480
I thought I might force the issue.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.200
Well, actually,
I was on the phone to your boss.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.320
We go back a long way.
He's very fond of you, by the way.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.880
He's expecting me to put you
on a plane back to Denmark.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.560
Yet, here we are.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.560
What did you discover
in the Torben files?

17:49.040 --> 17:50.560
That he took me for a fool.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.400
Might have been that.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.880
The person we're interested in is
the one who assaulted you yesterday.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.720
I didn't see his name in the files.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.720
Well, would you like to give it to me
and I'll put it in?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.000
I'm offering you a way out,
you appreciate that.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.760
A way out of what?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.560
Torben father of...

18:13.080 --> 18:14.200
He's a wannabe arms dealer,

18:14.280 --> 18:17.040
which means you're either a shit spy
or you're in on it.

18:17.920 --> 18:18.960
Which is it?

18:30.920 --> 18:32.720
You buried your little sister.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.760
Who was more like a daughter to you.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.800
You've been overlooked at work.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.680
You have more red flags
than a Moscow parade.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.800
It was Torben
who pulled me out of the fog

18:46.880 --> 18:48.520
after my sister died.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.080
So him and, and this,

18:51.520 --> 18:53.960
they are the most hope
that I've had in years.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.880
If he used me,
then I want to rip his heart out.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.080
Well, that's why
you're not on the plane home.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.000
No.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.760
The reason is that your people,

19:06.920 --> 19:08.080
they have nothing.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.680
So, right now, I'm your best bet
at finding Torben.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.600
So, let's stop this messing around,
shall we?

19:20.240 --> 19:21.040
Very good.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.880
I'm gonna enjoy watching you.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.400
Goodbye, Miss Poulsen.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.040
It's been my absolute pleasure.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.440
See you around.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.440
-Code blue.
-What are you doing?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.760
Stand still! On your knees!
Drop onto your hands!

20:07.840 --> 20:09.520
-Get on the floor now!
-Code blue.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.040
Do it now!

20:11.120 --> 20:12.000
Clear the area.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.920
-Get him out.
-What's happening?

20:14.000 --> 20:14.960
Just do what she says.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.040
Lie flat on the ground.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.120
Quickly now.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.120
Shit!

20:21.640 --> 20:23.480
We'll get you back to Downing Street.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.320
-Well, who are you?
-I'm a photographer.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
What, press?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.120
I was sent an email telling me where.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.360
Who sent the email?

20:29.440 --> 20:30.320
It was anonymous.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.320
You thought to break in

20:32.400 --> 20:34.560
past the PM's security detail
and no one would mind?

20:34.640 --> 20:37.040
I was just told
it would make my career.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.800
It'll get you ten years in jail.
Hope it was worth it.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.040
The photo's already been uploaded
to the cloud.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.000
How about I upload you to the cloud?

20:50.840 --> 20:52.840
It's an absolute shit show.
I want you to get on this.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.240
Gross invasion of privacy.
Not in the national interest.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.160
Go on.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.920
I told you the DPS
would lose their shit.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.040
You cannot just sack off
your armed guards.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.800
I wanted privacy.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.200
You'll have double the guard
next time you go to the toilet.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.320
-You've made your point.
-And well done, you.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.040
He says you threatened to kill him.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.640
We have a photo of the PM
with a code name scrawled across it.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.480
-Redback.
-He was a pap, not a fucking killer.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.360
I couldn't see
what he was pointing at the PM.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.680
He's lucky I didn't take him out.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.960
The TV crew is waiting for you.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.880
I was led to believe
you were reliable.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.240
No. Don't you dare
try and put this on us.

21:42.320 --> 21:44.320
His main selling point
is his honesty,

21:44.920 --> 21:47.600
which the tabloids
are now questioning, thanks to you.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.680
For taking a secret detail
to meet your bit on the side,

21:49.760 --> 21:51.120
maybe questions should be asked.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.600
Get rid of her.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.320
Now.

21:56.080 --> 21:56.960
Look,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.040
my team were handpicked.
I can vouch for them with my life.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.560
The PM's location was leaked
and it wasn't us.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.360
I mean, the guy had a key,
for God's sake.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.520
Your dad was right about you.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.240
Sorry?

22:12.120 --> 22:13.880
I had you on a short list of one

22:13.960 --> 22:16.440
for Glen Whitelaw's job,
but your father...

22:17.600 --> 22:19.280
he told me you weren't up to it.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.720
-He...
-Now you can go.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.440
Well, Jonathan, I can confirm
that after a fruitful conversation,

22:38.080 --> 22:39.080
we've worked out a schedule

22:39.160 --> 22:41.160
whereby the leader
of the opposition and I

22:41.240 --> 22:43.680
will take turns going up to Scotland

22:44.200 --> 22:47.480
to convince people
that a no-vote is the right vote.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.400
And, yes, there will be crossovers
where we both appear on stage.

22:51.960 --> 22:55.560
After all,
this is beyond party politics.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.480
The state of the Union is paramount.

22:58.560 --> 23:02.280
Prime Minister, when will you tell us
who the mystery woman is?

23:04.080 --> 23:06.480
Well, Jonathan, we're here today
to talk about the referendum.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.280
The people have a right to know.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.120
This is the single biggest issue
facing the United Kingdom...

23:13.200 --> 23:15.280
How does your wife feel
about this situation?

23:17.040 --> 23:18.880
I think the statement
that both political parties

23:18.960 --> 23:21.120
are making by appearing on stage
at the same time

23:21.200 --> 23:24.400
sends a very clear message
to the people of Scotland.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.800
We want you in the UK.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.680
The photographer's info
came from spoofed email addresses

23:32.760 --> 23:34.960
saying the PM would be with a woman
at such and such a place.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.000
And the combination to a lock box.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.520
No digital fingerprints on the email.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.520
There's no doubt about it.
The sender's an expert.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.920
You think this is linked to Redback?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.680
If it is, I'm not seeing the play.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.760
So, what do you want me to do next?

23:54.640 --> 23:55.440
Hey?

23:55.960 --> 23:58.480
Well, you're the boss, right?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.920
-Congrats, Levi.
-Yes, top one.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.320
So, William told you?

24:08.560 --> 24:09.360
Found him!

24:10.000 --> 24:10.960
Berlin just emailed.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.040
-Right.
-Oleg Adamov.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.120
Worked for the GRU.
Hardly any paperwork.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.040
Kabul market, 1996.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.080
And Leppo Airport, 1999.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.720
Paris, 2017. He was there.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.560
Zagreb post office, '05. Jesus!

24:26.640 --> 24:28.920
All right, this guy
is a serious player.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.640
Let's get that picture circulated.
I want eyes on the street.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.440
My money's on him
still being in London, okay?

24:34.520 --> 24:35.760
Let's bring him in.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.920
If that's alright with you.

24:38.920 --> 24:39.720
Sure.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.880
Comrade Adamov,

25:03.560 --> 25:05.800
so nice to see you.

25:06.760 --> 25:07.640
Gavril.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.840
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.160
I'm sorry.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.760
Look, we always knew
this might happen.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.360
That poor girl
lost her mum a month ago.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.000
And she's come to you for support.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.160
That's exactly why I'm trying
to keep her name out of the press.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.040
Yes, but

26:12.240 --> 26:14.320
eventually
you're going to have to tell them.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.080
That's who you are.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.560
That's why you were elected.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.960
You tell the truth.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.920
And...

26:26.600 --> 26:30.360
And if you do tell them
that Holly's your daughter,

26:31.080 --> 26:33.640
I think we all
need to be sure that she is

26:34.280 --> 26:35.200
your daughter.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.680
A DNA test will prove it.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.600
Unequivocally.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.720
Okay.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.400
But if we do do it,
I don't wanna lie to her.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.320
We need to have her consent.

26:54.800 --> 26:55.640
So get it.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.360
The name's Bond.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.720
James Bond.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.680
Yeah, more like Octo-pussy.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.200
A bit overdressed
for the late shift, mate.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.440
-You're not coming to the knees-up?
-No.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.160
And neither are you.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.640
What?

27:29.720 --> 27:31.160
I'm sorry, Cinderella,

27:31.240 --> 27:33.760
but the likes of you and me,
we're never invited to the ball.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.600
Forty-nine known acquaintances
of Oleg Adamov,

27:37.680 --> 27:38.960
so get your dialling finger out.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.200
Wait. Seriously?

27:42.200 --> 27:44.280
Then why did Beatrice
tell me to hire a tux?

27:44.840 --> 27:45.680
Hey, it's funny.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.560
But I look the fucking business.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.640
Right.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.440
She wants updates every hour.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.320
Hi.

28:13.800 --> 28:14.600
<i>Hi.</i>

28:15.600 --> 28:17.320
<i>I saw your press conference.</i>

28:18.800 --> 28:19.880
Yes.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.400
As train wrecks go, that was

28:24.160 --> 28:25.200
one of the best.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.120
<i>I won't mind</i>
<i>if you wanna tell them about me.</i>

28:28.200 --> 28:29.640
From the photo, I don't

28:30.160 --> 28:32.280
think you can be identified.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.400
<i>That's good, I suppose.</i>

28:36.840 --> 28:38.200
When you're ready,

28:39.080 --> 28:41.480
we'll tell them who you really are.

28:45.920 --> 28:46.720
Okay.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.400
But if we do that,

28:48.480 --> 28:52.360
the press will treat you
like public property.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.400
<i>I can handle it.</i>

28:57.520 --> 28:59.040
We all say that till it happens.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.080
When they come at you,
they're like a wolf pack.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.920
They'll pick your private life
to bits.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.360
<i>Your mum's, too.</i>

29:07.880 --> 29:10.440
I don't think we had anything
to hide, Mum and me.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.080
<i>The thing is</i>

29:12.160 --> 29:14.080
I don't wanna put you through it,

29:14.880 --> 29:16.120
if there's any doubt.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.520
<i>What do you mean?</i>

29:18.600 --> 29:20.160
I mean, if we're gonna go public.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.120
If?

29:22.840 --> 29:23.800
Then...

29:27.320 --> 29:29.040
we need to know for certain.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.200
Know what?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.280
That I'm

29:33.840 --> 29:35.960
really your father.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.840
But you are.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.720
Mum told me.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.280
Look, I know this is hard,

29:49.360 --> 29:51.720
but we just have to know for certain.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.240
So...

29:55.640 --> 29:56.720
A DNA test

29:57.240 --> 29:59.240
<i>would let us know where we stand.</i>

30:03.680 --> 30:05.120
You don't want this, do you?

30:05.560 --> 30:07.280
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

30:08.400 --> 30:09.800
Your mum told me there was

30:11.560 --> 30:12.840
a one-in-three chance.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.120
What do you mean, one-in-three?

30:18.200 --> 30:19.720
That you could be

30:20.480 --> 30:23.320
someone else's besides... besides me.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.480
She never told me that.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.720
Anyway, it's just best
if there's no doubt.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.000
<i>You wouldn't need to worry</i>
<i>about any of the...</i>

30:37.800 --> 30:40.080
<i>You know, the cost or the hassle.</i>
<i>We'd take care of everything.</i>

30:40.160 --> 30:41.080
I've got to go.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.000
"A one-in-three chance?"

30:58.200 --> 31:00.200
Did you really think
that was a good idea?

31:01.600 --> 31:03.960
A one-in-three chance?

31:04.040 --> 31:06.840
Good God Almighty, Adam!

31:35.600 --> 31:36.960
Are we gonna have a problem?

31:45.880 --> 31:50.160
You're my boss because our boss
sees some game in that choice.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.120
When my granddad came to London,

31:56.520 --> 31:58.320
the B&Bs had these signs.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.320
"No blacks, no Irish, no dogs."

32:03.320 --> 32:05.320
He'd bark for a full house.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.920
If the only way I get this job

32:09.000 --> 32:12.480
is through anti-nepotism bullshit,
I'll take it.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.120
Well, he's counting on that.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.400
Look,

32:17.440 --> 32:20.000
everybody said
I'd never make it to this level.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.720
I'm not giving it up.

32:24.120 --> 32:28.000
So, get on board
or put in for a transfer.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.240
Maybe that's his play.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.720
Look...

32:34.440 --> 32:36.160
Life gets complicated, so

32:36.720 --> 32:38.440
when it's simple,
I hang onto it, yeah?

32:39.360 --> 32:41.720
I get to tell you what to do,

32:41.800 --> 32:43.160
you get to do it.

32:43.240 --> 32:47.040
Any problems arising from that fact
will get dealt with.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.400
I've got a photo of my dad,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.080
right, when he was
about seven years old,

32:58.160 --> 32:59.840
and he's holding a jam jar.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.160
Inside he's caught

33:02.920 --> 33:04.480
a wasp and a bee.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.960
The look on his face.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.840
Jane Austen said
that all men are surrounded

33:32.920 --> 33:35.520
by a neighbourhood
of voluntary spies.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.960
Well, that was certainly my life
growing up.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.640
A neighbourhood of spies
at the breakfast table.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.640
And the grandest of them all
was my father.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.960
William Ogilvy, as you all know,
is a legend.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.320
In fact, he's a man of many legends.

33:55.720 --> 33:59.080
Tonight was organised
by our friend Glen.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.080
Taken too soon.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.640
Glen often used to say

34:05.080 --> 34:07.520
that what makes Dad
such a brilliant spy

34:07.600 --> 34:10.160
is his ability to be all things
to all people.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.720
To many of you he's a leader,
a friend,

34:14.520 --> 34:15.760
a boss,

34:15.840 --> 34:17.560
pretty tough if needs be.

34:19.680 --> 34:21.400
To me he is a father.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.280
And a teacher.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.440
I wouldn't be who I am,
if it weren't for him.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.680
I wouldn't be where I am,
if it weren't for you.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.680
Great men affect lives.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.600
They affect worlds.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.160
They affect change.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.760
They're the earthquakes
beneath our feet.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.920
My father continues to affect me
on a daily basis.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.160
I give you William Ogilvy.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.080
William Ogilvy.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.800
Quite the speech.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.400
Yeah, it did have
a few more jokes in it,

35:34.480 --> 35:36.320
but when it came to it,
I didn't feel...

35:40.200 --> 35:43.400
You always said I got further
on my looks than my sense of humour.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.680
Did I?

35:46.320 --> 35:48.080
I thought I said that
about your mother.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.000
She knew how to hold a silence,
as well.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.240
Just the right amount of time.

36:06.640 --> 36:09.680
Before she said what was on her mind.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.640
You talked the Home Secretary
out of giving me Glen's job.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.080
There it is.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.520
I'm good enough
to organise this shindig,

36:19.600 --> 36:20.760
but not for the Service?

36:22.560 --> 36:24.560
We live in precarious times.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.000
I backed Levi for sound reasons.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.160
The fact you're complaining about it
rather proves my point.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.760
We have a critical terrorist threat.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.360
The fate of the Union
is in our hands.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.880
I trust you know what to do.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.280
Now you're trying to butter us up
as the new boss.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.640
-Cheers, lads.
-Congratulations, mate.

37:17.720 --> 37:18.520
Yeah.

37:18.960 --> 37:19.760
Tops.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.440
A wasp and a bee
are trapped in a jam jar, yes?

37:29.480 --> 37:30.800
Which one would win?

37:31.960 --> 37:35.240
I don't know. A wasp and a bee
are trapped in a jam jar.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.360
Which one would win?

37:38.360 --> 37:39.600
It isn't a joke, mate.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.240
You're telling me.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.040
Fuck.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.920
Pull yourself together.

39:06.320 --> 39:07.800
I met your father today.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.360
I see where you get
your charm and ethics.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.800
Everybody's talking about you.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.600
Who would work for their own father
if promotion wasn't guaranteed?

39:22.320 --> 39:24.040
Is this your best play?

39:25.160 --> 39:26.520
Just trying to rile me.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.200
How did that make you feel?

39:28.280 --> 39:31.720
That your own dad didn't think
that you were up to it.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.520
Look, I've had a pretty shitty day,
so shall we just get on with it?

39:38.680 --> 39:39.800
You've heard of hyoscine?

39:41.520 --> 39:42.320
Yeah.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.160
You know, you are good.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.040
You never drop it, do you?
Not for a second.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.200
Which means
you could be telling the truth.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.440
High praise.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.520
Either you are
the heartbroken girlfriend

39:55.600 --> 39:59.000
searching for her terrorist boyfriend
who she had no clue about

40:00.400 --> 40:02.240
or you're in on it.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.200
Allied to the man who beat you up.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.600
Well, he nearly fucking killed me.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.080
And you let that happen, not me.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.080
Tell me where to find Oleg Adamov.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.120
Who?

40:16.200 --> 40:17.480
The man who attacked you,

40:18.320 --> 40:19.480
who killed my friend.

40:22.760 --> 40:26.040
I don't care whether you trust me
or not, because I know the truth.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.040
How about I inject you with this

40:34.640 --> 40:36.120
and then we find out for sure?

40:38.560 --> 40:40.080
Scared the mask will slip?

40:45.040 --> 40:46.160
No, I'm...

40:48.000 --> 40:50.400
I'm just wondering
what it will do to my baby.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.880
Look, if you're telling the truth,

40:57.600 --> 41:00.800
I will share everything that we have
on Torben and Adamov.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.560
And we'll find them together.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.000
Okay.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.560
Do it.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.440
What the fuck? What are you doing?

42:02.120 --> 42:03.840
Your father,
he wouldn't have hesitated.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.880
In our line of work,
trusting people costs lives.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.560
You and me, we're not there yet.

42:12.640 --> 42:15.560
No, but we want the same things
for different reasons.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.720
But we want the same things.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.480
Your father had a chance
to put me on a plane, but he didn't.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.800
And surely you can trust him?

43:06.320 --> 43:07.920
What shall we drink too?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.480
To the friendship of nations.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.080
And to the peaceful skies
above our heads.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.640
And to the peaceful skies
above our heads.

43:17.840 --> 43:18.920
Red spider.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.320
Red spider.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.960
Where are you up to with Redback?

43:39.040 --> 43:41.160
Find whoever is trying to buy
the BF100 process,

43:41.240 --> 43:43.120
and then we've got a trail to Adamov.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.120
I was so sorry
to hear about your mum.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.000
We've intercepted chatter

43:48.080 --> 43:50.240
about a credible threat
to your Prime Minister.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.560
This man here.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.840
And he used the word "Redback."

43:53.920 --> 43:55.880
-What?
-You heard it before?

43:55.960 --> 43:57.680
I'm not your fucking mate, Cornwell!

43:57.760 --> 43:59.360
I'm coming for you!

43:59.440 --> 44:00.520
Can we talk about this?

44:00.600 --> 44:03.160
Not right now, no.
We can talk this through with Irene.

44:03.240 --> 44:06.160
What is Redback? It's some kind
of terror threat, isn't it?

44:06.240 --> 44:07.080
We don't know.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.400
I lost my boy.

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
I'm sorry.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.440
