00:11.428 --> 00:13.888
In Hollywood,

00:13.930 --> 00:16.433
the fastest way to the top

00:16.474 --> 00:19.561
is to work for someone
who's already there.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.777
The system dictates that one
must first be a slave

00:27.819 --> 00:29.487
before you can be a success.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.242
Few people have the drive
to endure the indignities

00:34.284 --> 00:36.244
that make up the system.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.711
This drive is usually
motivated by greed.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.424
Sometimes ambition.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.637
Sometimes, even love.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.100
There are stories of love...

01:02.520 --> 01:07.067
Inspiring success over the
most insurmountable odds...

01:10.236 --> 01:11.571
Empowering stories...

01:13.948 --> 01:16.534
Where we are not crucifying
one another,

01:16.576 --> 01:18.495
but playing fair.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.837
This...

01:35.887 --> 01:38.306
Is not one of those stories.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.711

vampires feeding ♪

02:08.753 --> 02:12.090

02:31.192 --> 02:34.320
You have no brain.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.321
You're an intern.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.199
You are here in service
of Joyce Holt,

02:38.241 --> 02:40.577
CEO of Fountain Pictures.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.829
What you think means nothing.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.873
What you feel
means nothing.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.749
You are nothing.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.043
A thousand nobodies land
at LAX every day,

02:49.085 --> 02:51.296
ready to kill to get inside
these gates.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.881
- Anything she wants--
- You get it.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.716
Everything you do,
you run through us.

02:54.757 --> 02:59.053
Can't take it?
Roll on back to bumfuck Iowa.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.600
Hi.
I'm L--

03:03.641 --> 03:04.642
Late.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.227
They told me 9:00.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.937
9:00 means 8:30.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.822
Meredith Lockhart's
in your office.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.032
The "Times'" run another piece,

03:19.073 --> 03:20.408
calling
the "Wanderlust Chronicles"

03:20.450 --> 03:24.120
the most relevant book series
of the decade.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.289
Referenced
the impending bidding war.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.809
I called the apothecary
in Melbourne.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.020
They aren't making
the almond sage one anymore.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.274
I'll call again.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.868
I debated between this
and the Dior,

04:03.910 --> 04:08.206
but Gucci makes me look
less Hollywood power dyke.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.290
Please.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.418
You love being
a Hollywood power dyke.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.378
That's true.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.797
All right, my friend.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.424
What is it gonna take
to make this happen?

04:18.466 --> 04:22.011
You gonna make me beg?
I'm happy to do so.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.304
You know the corporate BS

04:23.346 --> 04:25.348
that comes
from a mainstream studio?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.391
It's not me.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.434
For my books,
I want a home

04:28.476 --> 04:31.187
that's more punk rock,
artist-driven.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.231
Punk rock and artist-driven's
not gonna pay

04:33.273 --> 04:34.899
pay for that $2,500 coat.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.567
This $2,850, bitch.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.780
If for no other reason, Meredith,

04:40.822 --> 04:43.574
don't you want to support
a female CEO

04:43.616 --> 04:45.118
in this fucking boys' club
town?

04:45.159 --> 04:46.911
You mean the token female.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.746
Fountain's the most
misogynistic monstrosity

04:48.788 --> 04:49.664
out there.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.291
'Cause my hands
have been tied.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.542
But I'm sure you've heard--

04:52.583 --> 04:55.378
Redmond's about to croak,
and you're gonna take over.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.550
Ain't gonna happen, Joyce.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.679
Here you go.
Should be all there.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.890
Double meat, no bun,
side of jalapeño,

05:07.932 --> 05:09.726
mega-mint agua fresca, no ice,

05:09.767 --> 05:13.354
and vegan banana bread pudding,
hold the coconut.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.982
I like the whole braided,
Amish, art chick look

05:16.024 --> 05:16.941
you got going on.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.359
Where, uh--where you from?

05:18.401 --> 05:19.569
Colorado Springs.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.572
Um, excuse me.
The skinless chicken breast?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.365
It's for her dog,

05:24.407 --> 05:26.909
so if you could put it
in a separate box,

05:26.951 --> 05:28.494
that would be great.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.954
I've been on this lot
for six years.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.664
I could...be your in-guy.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.708
All right, mate.
Give it a rest.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.419
My sister?
She's not interested.

05:36.461 --> 05:40.006
Yeah, well, your loss.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.799
Huh.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.552
I always wanted a brother.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.265
First day?

05:49.307 --> 05:51.017
It's that obvious?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.311
Nah.
You're a natural.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.855
Let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

05:55.897 --> 06:00.109
Let me guess.
Travis, Joyce's dog Wesley?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.779
He used to work for me
before Joyce poached him.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.447
Travis, that is.
Not the dog.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.240
Work for you?

06:06.282 --> 06:07.617
Yeah.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.078
Martin Bruhl,
VP of Production.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.081
Lou Simms.
VP of Hail Caesar's.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.125
- Oh ho. Wow.
- Sorry, bad joke.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.752
Terrible joke.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.463
It's all right, though.
I've heard worse.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.674
You gotta be careful, though.
Travis is--

06:23.716 --> 06:25.760
- Batshit crazy?
- Yep.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.221
He and Alex are Joyce's
wrecking crew.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.639
They've been fired
hundreds of times,

06:29.680 --> 06:31.224
but she'll never get rid
of them.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.267
Because?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.685
They know where the bodies
are buried.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.856
Can't get to her
without going through them.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.526
Is getting to her
a goal around here?

07:07.885 --> 07:09.178
Excuse me?

07:11.222 --> 07:14.267
I finished everything
on the list you gave me.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.647
I also went ahead and did
tomorrow's work as well.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.649
Congratulations.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.280
I'm gonna need you to, uh--

07:27.321 --> 07:28.489
Sorry.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.077
Hey, Greta!

08:17.622 --> 08:19.665
I survived my first day!

08:37.808 --> 08:40.394
We're gonna move
to Hollywood one day.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.731
It's always warm.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.859
You can have short sleeves
in December.

08:48.277 --> 08:52.657
And we can have a lemon tree
in our backyard.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.909
- Promise?
- Promise.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.185
Our lunch with the new
investors just confirmed.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.979
"Wanderlust Chronicles."

09:23.020 --> 09:24.605
Meredith Lockhart's
book series.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.606
I'm working on it.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.191
What does that mean?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.318
You either got them
or you failed.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.778
Means I'm working on it.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.406
- I heard Universal is--
- You heard wrong.

09:42.290 --> 09:46.043
I promised them
to the new investors, Marty.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.589
- I'm aware.
- There's a clock on the offer.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.632
Five billion dollars
are at stake, Martin,

09:51.674 --> 09:54.468
money needed to save
this fucking place.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.140
And how do you plan
on getting Redmond involved

09:59.181 --> 10:00.683
in all this?

10:00.725 --> 10:01.892
I don't.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.479
Keep the investors on ice
until he dies already.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.189
Copy.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.817
And get the rights
to the books, or we're fucked.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.696
Well, I'll be fine,
but you'll be fucked.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.241
Please tell me you got
in touch

10:17.283 --> 10:18.242
with Meredith's assistant.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.702
I've left word
like five times.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.037
He's not returning.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.164
Leverage your relationship.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.875
Go dirty if you need
to go dirty.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.794
We need those fucking books.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.426
Plug your nose.
It's gonna smell like shit.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.678
Don't laugh.
She's fired six people

10:37.720 --> 10:39.138
over this fucking tea.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.390
- What's it for?
- Getting pregnant.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.268
'Cause, come on,
she's gonna be such a lit mom.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.314
I'm happy to make it.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.024
And risk getting fired
your first week?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.776
Be number seven?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.279
I think I can handle it.

10:55.321 --> 10:59.033
All right.
Knock yourself out.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.039
How do you think lunch went?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.499
They were placating us.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.250
If Redmond isn't gone soon,
I'll guarantee you,

11:08.292 --> 11:09.835
they'll pivot,
and we'll lose them.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.758
Yep.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.552
Yeah, yeah.
I'm with her now.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.429
All right. Copy.

11:21.555 --> 11:22.890
Well, speak of the devil.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.768
Redmond is requesting you
at his house.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.603
God damn it.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.568
Wait in the car.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.004
Look what the cat dragged in.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.241
Keeps me young.

12:27.413 --> 12:32.835
Doctors are telling me
that I'm in my final days.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.090
Oh Jesus,
you're a terrible actress.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.426
No wonder you never made it.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.806
Rumor has it,

12:45.848 --> 12:47.391
you've been talking
to investors

12:47.433 --> 12:49.435
about outside capital.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.772
- Not true.
- That's what I told them.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.566
I said, she wouldn't do that.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.318
She gave me her word

12:57.359 --> 12:59.945
that she would run the studio
the way I wanted,

12:59.987 --> 13:02.072
the way my father ran it.

13:02.114 --> 13:07.369
The last great American studio,
run by Americans.

13:08.078 --> 13:11.373
What a novel fucking idea
that is, huh?

13:11.415 --> 13:16.253
No chinks, no wops,
no A-rabs.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.881
Am I right?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.137
Do I have your word?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.979
You have my word.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.532
I assume that didn't go well.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.496
Shit.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.624
What?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.167
Uh...

13:57.962 --> 13:59.129
What?

14:00.881 --> 14:03.300
Looks like you were right.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.803
Meredith's getting into a deal
with Universal.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.225
Universal, real fucking
punk rock.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.810
They're backing up
the cash truck.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.104
There's no way
we can match this.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.605
I'm sorry.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.233
I went down
every single avenue.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.943
I mean, as long as that
cheap fuck is still breathing,

14:20.985 --> 14:24.196
there's no way we can--
we can compete with this.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.658
My hands are tied.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.702
I'm sorry.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.042
Get out.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.398
What the fuck are you doing?

15:41.440 --> 15:42.691
Open this door again,

15:42.733 --> 15:43.943
and you'll be slinging smoothies

15:43.984 --> 15:45.694
at the Van Nuys Jamba Juice
so fast,

15:45.736 --> 15:47.863
you won't know
what fucking hit you.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.239
Out.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.996
I am fucking neurotic, Tom.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.290
The film business is
in the last innings.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.085
You know how many
out-of-work, white, male

16:01.126 --> 16:03.295
studio execs there are
in this town right now?

16:03.337 --> 16:05.381
Those books are
a big fucking problem.

16:05.422 --> 16:08.008
Joyce--she promised them
to our new investors.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.513
Maybe pretend
that I didn't say that.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.724
If that information was to leak
to the press or something,

16:15.766 --> 16:17.309
then, uh...

16:17.351 --> 16:19.687
Redmond wouldn't be too happy,
you know?

16:24.441 --> 16:26.485
All right, speak to you soon.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.480
Just leave it.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.360
Yes, ma'am.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.362
You from the South?

17:14.283 --> 17:16.910
Colorado.

17:16.952 --> 17:20.247
Girls from Colorado
don't say "ma'am."

17:20.289 --> 17:22.666
Too much Tennessee Williams
growing up.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.506
What color
were these resoled?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.468
- Black?
- And the original color was?

17:32.509 --> 17:33.469
Red.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.387
Therefore, they should have
been resoled...

17:35.429 --> 17:38.640
- Red.
- Right.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.851
Travis, get in here.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.776
Eight mil a year,

17:48.817 --> 17:51.361
and the crazy bitch resoles
her shoes.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.362
Mm-hmm.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.823
Why are rich people always
so fucking cheap?

17:54.865 --> 17:58.327
Doesn't make sense.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.329
Ooh.
Hey.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.082
Heidi.
9 o'clock.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.795
Don't you dare invite her
to sit.

18:07.836 --> 18:11.757
Lou!
Come sit!

18:11.799 --> 18:15.094
I fucking hate you.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.137
Only if you let me buy
the next round.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.722
Oh, well, in that case,

18:18.764 --> 18:22.017
Señor, Don Julio 1942,
por favor?

18:22.059 --> 18:22.893
Three, please.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.478
Uh, none for me.
I'm good.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.647
Harvard bitch is sober.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.898
Unfathomable, I know.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.775
Just remember,
I may be her ho this week,

18:29.817 --> 18:31.235
but that means you're up next.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.986
Queen is on a tear.
- Mm.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.238
See, one week she loves you,

18:34.279 --> 18:36.990
gives you an $80 candle
that she got in a gift basket.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.284
Next week...
You're dead.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.203
But you do end up
with a very nice candle

18:41.245 --> 18:43.122
you can put in your shitty
Echo Park apartment,

18:43.163 --> 18:44.915
so when you bring home
the guy you met on Grindr,

18:44.957 --> 18:46.166
he thinks you're super legit.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.085
Not sure a candle
would cut it for me.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.674
Your friends back home.

18:53.715 --> 18:57.302
They teachers, accountants,
social workers?

18:57.344 --> 18:58.262
Kill me now.

18:58.303 --> 19:02.099
Proximity to greatness
is intoxicating.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.726
I saw Ryan Gosling's dick
on a set visit once.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.146
I mean, it was just
from the side, but still,

19:07.187 --> 19:09.439
made my fucking year.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.649
Speaking of dicks...

19:10.691 --> 19:13.902
Whoa, seriously dude.
Nobody wants to see that.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.029
I do.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.490
All right,
I'm gonna get my fuck on.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.867
Bye, bitches.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.245
My apologies.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.956
Crude and inappropriate
are his default settings.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.291
Got it.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.792
Whoops.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.963
Careful.
Joyce gave him his start.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.673
Back in the day,
they used to...

19:34.715 --> 19:36.508
No, we're just friends.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.178
Marty Bruhl belongs
to Joyce Holt.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.525
Okay.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.612
That's it.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.535
Your studio migrating
into our bedroom?

20:03.577 --> 20:07.414
God, don't even get me started.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.082
I should just cancel
that fucking show.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.709
I'm not even close
to being ready.

20:10.751 --> 20:11.627
Stay home and work.

20:11.668 --> 20:12.753
Don't.
Don't fucking do that,

20:12.794 --> 20:13.795
not right now.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.089
You're building the show up
way too much.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.174
Don't be so precious.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.885
I'm the one
being too precious?

20:19.927 --> 20:23.472
'Cause you're so chill
and whatever about your work.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.724
I'm not an artist.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.517
Yeah, well, guess what?

20:29.269 --> 20:31.230
Neither am I.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.443
I'm Joyce Holt's plus-one.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.784
- New coat?
- Yeah.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.203
What's the occasion?

20:46.245 --> 20:50.165
Looks like more
than just dinner with the boys.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.833
You can come.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.965
I lost this week.

20:58.006 --> 20:58.882
I don't like losing.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.634
There'll be other books.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.635
Come on!
Come out.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.678
Get dressed.
It'll be fun.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.346
Food's supposed
to be incredible.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.431
No.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.391
Tonight's the only night

21:07.432 --> 21:08.976
I don't have to go out
this week.

21:09.017 --> 21:12.938
Happy to stay home and wear
sweats and look like shit.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.606
You never look like shit.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.029
Have fun tonight.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.240
I love you.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.745
Love you too.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.969
I was 19 when I moved here.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.220
Penniless.

21:45.262 --> 21:48.098
A lost cause,
my teachers told me.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.143
There was a passage I
read once as a girl

21:51.184 --> 21:54.187
that, for whatever reason, resonated.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.023
It was written
by Marilyn Monroe

21:56.064 --> 21:58.066
shortly before her death.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.153
And as sad as it may read now,

22:01.194 --> 22:06.158
it encapsulates the very thing
that draws people here.

22:06.199 --> 22:09.161
This town.
This business.

22:09.202 --> 22:12.456
The promise.
That sense of hope.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.499
Magic.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.408
Dude, your girlfriend's back.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.410
Do you have any gum?
Mints?

23:40.877 --> 23:44.756
I have a pomegranate acai
throat lozenge.

I didn't have anyone
in my life

24:46.401 --> 24:48.987
telling me that I had
any worth.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.448
I was so desperate
for that validation.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.409
We all need that one person
in our lives

24:54.451 --> 24:57.162
to tell us that we can do it,

24:57.204 --> 24:58.914
that we matter.

When I first moved here,

25:26.525 --> 25:29.986
as I looked
into the Hollywood night,

25:30.028 --> 25:32.489
there must be thousands
of girls sitting alone

25:32.531 --> 25:35.075
just like me, dreaming.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.871
But I'm not gonna worry
about them,

25:39.913 --> 25:43.083
because I'm dreaming
the hardest.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.878
Because I'm dreaming
the hardest.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.673
We do what we have to do,

25:49.714 --> 25:51.841
in order to get what we want.
