WEBVTT

00:22.272 --> 00:23.189
HEY, JAMES.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.651
THANK YOU NOTE
FROM ME AND GINA.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.861
LOTS OF HAPPINESS.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.529
YEAH. THEY'RE
BEAUTIFUL DISHES.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.615
AS FAR AS THE ELOPEMENT,
I HOPE EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD.

00:32.699 --> 00:33.825
OH, YEAH, SURE.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.827
GINA WENT HOME EARLY?

00:35.910 --> 00:37.120
YEAH. SHE CAME HOME
AROUND 2:00.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.371
SHE WAS FEELING
A LITTLE QUEASY.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.664
I GUESS THAT'S
TO BE EXPECTED.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.665
AFTERNOON, ALL.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.541
GREG.
HEY.
GREG.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.755
HOW'S IT GOIN', ANDY?

00:46.838 --> 00:50.050
STOCKING UP
FOR OUR 4:00 TO 1:00?

00:50.133 --> 00:52.010
4.75 FOR SNACK
REPLACEMENTS.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.053
OH, YEAH.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.181
4.75. SAY NO MORE.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.223
EVEN THOUGH, UH...

00:57.307 --> 00:59.559
I'M NO LONGER
DRINKING DAIRY.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.686
HEY.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.687
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

01:02.771 --> 01:03.855
4.75 FOR SNACK
REPLACEMENTS.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.648
UH, TOMORROW OK?
YEAH.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.234
THERE YOU GO.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.736
BROUGHT
YOUR DINNER, HUH?

01:09.819 --> 01:11.571
YEAH. I MADE PASTA SALAD,
WHICH MY KIDS HATE.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.573
NOW I'M EATING IT
THE LAST 3 NIGHTS.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.075
LONG AS
I BRING A MEAL,

01:15.158 --> 01:16.576
I DON'T MIND
A 4:00 TO 1:00.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.078
I SORT OF ENJOY IT.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.579
ME, TOO.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.039
YOU MISS
YOUR TV SHOWS.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.249
THAT'S ONE NEGATIVE.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.667
THAT'S TRUE, HUH?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.837
HEY. HEY, HEY.
HEY. HEY.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.591
YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.676
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, ANDY?

01:33.760 --> 01:37.055
ABOUT EVERY TIME I COLLECT
FOR SNACK REPLACEMENTS,

01:37.138 --> 01:39.265
YOU STIFF ME ON THE CHANGE.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.600
WHAT HAPPENED? OH.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.769
I PUT IN A NICKEL
FOR A QUARTER.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.104
THAT'S...

01:44.187 --> 01:46.439
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A FEDERAL CASE.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.775
LAST TIME, YOU PAY YOUR SHARE
WITH PENNY ROLLS.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.694
BANK TELLER BUSTS SYLVIA.
SHE'S 14 CENTS LIGHT.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.779
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

01:52.862 --> 01:54.614
EXCUSE ME.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.698
15th SQUAD.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.783
THANKS.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.577
ANDY.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.079
HE DID IT AGAIN.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.081
WE GOT A DOA
UNDER THE FDR.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.624
CAR FIRE.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.793
OH, MY GOD, ABBY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

02:06.876 --> 02:08.795
IS YOUR STOMACH
ALL RIGHT?

02:08.878 --> 02:09.879
I'LL BE RIGHT
OVER THERE.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.631
JUST SIT DOWN.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.716
TRY AND STAY CALM.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.761
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MEDAVOY?

02:16.845 --> 02:19.389
PUSH-IN ROBBERY AT HER
AND KATHY'S APARTMENT.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.807
James: IS ABBY
ALL RIGHT?

02:20.890 --> 02:23.476
ABBY'S SHOT IN THE ARM.
KATHY'S DEAD.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.561
OH, MY GOD.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.642
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

03:45.725 --> 03:46.601
FEMALE DOA.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.102
SHOT DURING A ROBBERY.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.604
2 WOMEN SHARED
THE RESIDENCE.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.939
ONE OF THEM'S
ON THE JOB.

03:51.022 --> 03:51.898
YEAH. WE KNOW ABBY.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.107
SHE'S PREGNANT,

03:53.191 --> 03:56.569
BUT SHE WAS LIVING
WITH THE FEMALE DOA.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.737
YEAH. OK.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.784
YOU WANT SOME WATER
TO DRINK?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.827
UH, NO. THANKS, GREG.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.079
HI, ABBY.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.623
ABBY, I'M SO SORRY.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.166
I CAN'T BELIEVE
ALL THIS HAPPENED.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.293
CAN YOU TRY AND
TELL US ABOUT IT?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.255
WE'D COME HOME
FROM GROCERY SHOPPING.

04:15.505 --> 04:19.300
THE GUY MUST HAVE FOLLOWED US
INTO THE BUILDING.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.678
KATHY HAD JUST
UNLOCKED THE DOOR

04:21.761 --> 04:24.472
WHEN HE PUT THE GUN
IN MY BACK

04:24.555 --> 04:26.307
AND TOLD US BOTH
TO GO INSIDE.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.811
WE DID EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAID.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.438
AND THEN I TOLD HIM

04:32.522 --> 04:34.190
TO JUST TAKE
THE MONEY AND GO.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.947
Jill: THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

04:41.030 --> 04:44.701
KATHY TRIED TO GET THE GUN
THAT WE KEEP IN THAT DRAWER.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.952
WAS HE GETTING VIOLENT?

04:46.035 --> 04:47.620
IS THAT WHY
SHE DID THAT?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.455
I DON'T KNOW.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.124
WHAT, HE JUST
SUDDENLY SHOT?

04:53.960 --> 04:56.296
SHE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT ME.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.299
I COULD SEE HER GETTING
MORE AND MORE WORRIED,

04:59.382 --> 05:03.052
AND, UH, AND THEN SHE JUST
SUDDENLY PROTECTED ME.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.138
AND THE GUY SHOT HER.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.890
I RAN FOR THE BEDROOM,
AND THE GUY SHOT ME, TOO.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.600
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GOT
HIT IN THE ARM.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.895
THEN HE LEFT.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.065
I DON'T THINK
THE WHOLE THING

05:16.274 --> 05:17.900
COULD HAVE TAKEN
MORE THAN A MINUTE.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.111
WHAT KIND OF A LOOK DID
YOU GET AT HIM, ABBY?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.571
WHITE.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.948
UH...30s.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.200
DRUGGIE LOOK.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.827
NO FACIAL HAIR.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.162
MAYBE 5'10".

05:29.245 --> 05:30.663
SO, PRETTY
NONDESCRIPT-LOOKING.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.582
WHAT DID HE TAKE?

05:32.665 --> 05:35.043
UH, JUST THE KEYS.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.211
BUT HE MADE NO EFFORT
TO ROB THE PLACE?

05:37.295 --> 05:38.588
NO.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.839
HE PROBABLY
GOT YOUR CAR.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.591
I'LL WANT TO GET THOSE
PARTICULARS FROM YOU.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.052
I NEED TO LIE DOWN.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.595
SURE.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.563
WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN
TO CATCH THIS GUY.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.066
AS TRAGIC AS IT IS,

05:58.149 --> 05:59.567
YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW

05:59.650 --> 06:01.569
IS TO TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF AND THE BABY.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.945
OK.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.289
NO BLOOD TRAIL
FROM THE DOOR TO THE PHONE.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.540
NO.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.625
NOT TOO MUCH SIGN
OF A STRUGGLE, EITHER.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.584
SHE SAID
THE WHOLE THING

06:16.667 --> 06:18.086
WAS OVER
IN ABOUT A MINUTE.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.045
RIGHT.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.089
YOU WANNA GO KNOCK
ON SOME DOORS?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.673
LET'S DO IT.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.606
BE CAREFUL.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.191
STILL HOT
AS HELL.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.192
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:41.275 --> 06:42.902
CAR WENT UP
ABOUT 4:00.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.195
FIRE STARTED
IN THE INTERIOR.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.863
GIRL SITTING IN
THE PASSENGER SEAT

06:45.947 --> 06:47.365
WITH A BULLET
IN HER HEAD.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.908
YOU KNOW IT'S A GIRL?

06:48.991 --> 06:51.035
YOU CAN STILL MAKE OUT
SOME MUSCLE TISSUE

06:51.119 --> 06:52.578
IN THE BREAST AREA.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.287
HAVE ANY I.D.?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.123
NOT ON HER.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.749
CAR'S REGISTERED
TO A JERRY TORELLI.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.960
SOME SON OF A BITCH.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.795
WANTED HER
GOOD AND DEAD.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.214
THAT GUY OVER THERE
SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.215
ALL RIGHT.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.634
I'LL TALK TO THE FIREMEN.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.889
THANKS.

07:11.973 --> 07:12.807
HOW YOU DOIN', SIR?

07:12.890 --> 07:14.267
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

07:14.350 --> 07:15.935
JIM CHANEY. I SAW IT FROM
MY WINDOW RIGHT THERE.

07:16.018 --> 07:16.978
WHAT'D YOU SEE, JIM?

07:17.061 --> 07:20.231
WHITE GUY DUMPS GASOLINE
INTO THE CAR,

07:20.314 --> 07:23.109
LIGHTS IT--BOOM--
EXPLOSION. INFERNO.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.569
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.237
THE GUY RUNS THAT WAY,

07:26.320 --> 07:27.488
GETS IN THE CAR
THAT'S WAITING,

07:27.572 --> 07:28.739
CAR JAMS OFF
SOON AS HE'S IN.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.283
DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT HIM,

07:30.366 --> 07:32.118
WHAT HE WAS WEARING?

07:32.201 --> 07:33.744
NO, CHIEF. MY EYES
WAS ON THAT FIRE.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.079
YEAH, OK.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.665
LISTEN, UM, I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A GIRL INSIDE.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.251
OTHERWISE, I'D HAVE
TRIED TO HELP.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.170
YOU TALKED TO US.
YOU HELPED.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.463
DID YOU GIVE THE COP

07:43.546 --> 07:44.922
YOUR NAME AND NUMBER
AND ALL THAT?

07:45.006 --> 07:45.923
YES.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.925
THEY SAID THE FIRE MARSHAL
CALLED THE OWNER.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.343
THEY KNOW NOT
TO DO THAT.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.178
WELL, LUCKILY, THEY
DIDN'T REACH HIM.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.762
ALL RIGHT. LET'S
GET OVER THERE.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.778
Man: WHO'S THERE?

08:07.862 --> 08:10.615
DETECTIVES.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.116
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.368
YOU JERRY TORELLI?
YEAH.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.870
I'M DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.205
THIS IS DETECTIVE SIMONE
AND RUSSELL.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.956
NOTHING BAD
HAPPENED, DID IT?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.166
YOU DRIVE A '92 PONTIAC?

08:20.249 --> 08:22.126
MY DAUGHTER JULIE
DOES.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.003
IT'S REGISTERED
IN MY NAME.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.171
DOES JULIE LIVE HERE
WITH YOU, SIR?

08:25.254 --> 08:26.881
YEAH. SHE'S JUST
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.674
AS LONG AS
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.884
WHEN DID YOU
LAST SEE JULIE?

08:29.967 --> 08:31.385
WE JUST SAW HER.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.803
SHE WAS JUST HERE
FOR MY BIRTHDAY PARTY

08:32.887 --> 08:34.305
TILL, UH, MAYBE 3:00.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.306
LONG AS SHE'S ALL RIGHT,

08:35.389 --> 08:37.183
THE HELL WITH WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE CAR.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.018
THAT CAR'S LICENSE PLATE IS
INVOLVED IN AN INVESTIGATION

08:39.101 --> 08:40.978
THAT WE'RE CONDUCTING
RIGHT NOW, MR. TORELLI.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.480
SO NOTHING TO BE
ALARMED ABOUT.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.982
WHERE'D YOUR DAUGHTER GO
WHEN SHE LEFT?

08:45.066 --> 08:45.983
I PRESUME ERRANDS.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.527
SHE GOT A BOYFRIEND,
MR. TORELLI?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.403
I HAD TO BREAK THAT OFF.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.322
SO WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH THE LICENSE PLATE?

08:51.405 --> 08:52.657
SOMEONE PUT IT
ON ANOTHER CAR?

08:52.740 --> 08:53.991
WHAT ELSE
CAN YOU TELL US

08:54.075 --> 08:55.243
ABOUT HER FORMER
BOYFRIEND, SIR?

08:55.326 --> 08:56.827
Woman: YOUR ICE CREAM'S
MELTING, JERRY.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.539
YEAH. THESE ARE
POLICE DETECTIVES.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.666
THEY THINK THE JERK
STOLE THE LICENSE PLATE

09:01.749 --> 09:02.708
OFF JULIE'S CAR.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.418
Simone: HELLO, MA'AM.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.878
ARE YOU HER MOTHER?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.171
NO. LOIS IS INSIDE.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.339
I'M JERRY'S
SISTER-IN-LAW.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.674
THE JERK'S NAME
IS SAM DePAUL.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.633
YEAH, JERK.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.510
OR "THE CREEP,"
WE CALL HIM.

09:12.593 --> 09:13.594
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.263
MY NIECE JAMIE
KNOWS WHERE HE LIVES.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.722
SHE'S HERE, TOO.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.349
WE'LL NEED TO TALK TO
HER THEN, IF THAT'S OK.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.517
SO, WHAT, THE JERK
USED HER PLATE

09:19.600 --> 09:21.519
TO PULL OFF SOME KIND
OF ROBBERY?

09:21.602 --> 09:23.187
THAT'S WHAT
THE INVESTIGATION'S ABOUT?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.106
LET US JUST TALK
WITH YOUR NIECE.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.066
DID I SAY THIS WAS
A BAD KID?

09:27.149 --> 09:28.359
IS MY JUDGMENT CONFIRMED?

09:28.442 --> 09:30.695
TAKE IT EASY
IN FRONT OF LOIS.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.363
COME ON. JUST
LET HER KNOW

09:32.446 --> 09:33.698
THERE'S NO CAUSE
FOR CONCERN.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.616
MY WIFE'S
THE NERVOUS TYPE.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.872
WHAT IS IT, JERRY?

09:41.956 --> 09:42.873
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.126
HONEY, THESE ARE DETECTIVES.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.795
THEY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE JERK.

09:47.878 --> 09:48.921
MY WIFE LOIS.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.257
WELL, JULIE WASN'T
SEEING SAM ANYMORE.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.633
WE UNDERSTAND THAT,
MA'AM.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.968
WE'RE HOPING THAT JAMIE

09:54.051 --> 09:55.886
WILL KNOW WHERE
WE CAN FIND HIM.

09:55.970 --> 09:56.887
ME?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.389
IS YOUR NAME JAMIE?

09:58.472 --> 10:00.474
DO YOU KNOW WHERE JULIE
WENT THIS AFTERNOON?

10:00.558 --> 10:01.726
NO.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.645
TELL THEM ABOUT
THE PHONE CALL.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.732
JULIE GOT A PHONE CALL
JUST AFTER LUNCH.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.275
SUDDENLY SHE'S
IN A BIG HURRY

10:09.358 --> 10:10.484
TO SKIP OUT
ON JERRY'S BIRTHDAY.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.485
WHERE WAS SHE GOING?

10:11.569 --> 10:12.737
I'M NOT GETTING HER
IN TROUBLE.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.905
NO ONE'S GETTING
INTO TROUBLE.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.157
WHO CALLED
FOR JULIE?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.491
SAM DePAUL?

10:18.826 --> 10:20.911
ALL RIGHT. YEAH. SHE WAS
GONNA GO MEET HIM,

10:20.995 --> 10:22.330
BUT SHE MUST HAVE
CHANGED HER MIND.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.749
'CAUSE SAM CALLED BACK LATER,
SAID SHE NEVER SHOWED UP.

10:24.832 --> 10:25.750
UH-HUH.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.627
SO I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.628
BUT DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE LIVES?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.338
I KNOW HIS BLOCK.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.756
WANNA TAKE A RIDE
WITH US?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.424
MAYBE YOU CAN
POINT IT OUT.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.593
GETS ME OUT
OF CLEANING UP.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.931
Jerry: AT LEAST WE KNOW
JULIE'S ALL RIGHT.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.350
THANKS.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.187
WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.576
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SOMETHING

11:00.660 --> 11:02.828
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT
NECESSARILY, GINA.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.789
M.E.'S ON NOTICE. AS SOON
AS THEY'RE DONE WITH KATHY,

11:04.872 --> 11:06.749
HE'S GONNA CONTACT ME.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.252
ABBY--ABBY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT NOW.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.963
TOMORROW'S TIME ENOUGH.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.590
YEAH. I PERSONALLY

11:14.674 --> 11:16.258
PUT THE FELONY ALARM
OUT ON YOUR CAR.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.762
TRY AND GET SOME REST.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.889
I'LL CALL YOU WITH
ANY DEVELOPMENTS.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.975
ABBY?

11:25.059 --> 11:28.604
WORRIED ABOUT KATHY'S
ARRANGEMENTS.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.981
THAT DOCTOR FROM NYU
IS COMING UP--

11:31.065 --> 11:32.274
GUY FROM ACROSS THE HALL.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.694
HE IS? GOOD.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.821
YEAH. I'LL BE INTERESTED
TO HEAR HIS STORY.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.864
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT, JILL?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.491
GREG, GUY WHO LIVES
ACROSS THE HALL

11:40.574 --> 11:41.784
CALLS AND WANTS
TO TALK TO US,

11:41.867 --> 11:43.536
WE WANT TO HEAR
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.787
OH, YEAH. NO.
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.705
THAT'S ALL.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.664
YEAH.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.708
Jill: THAT'S THE GUY.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.003
ARE YOU DETECTIVE
KIRKENDALL?

11:53.087 --> 11:54.630
YEAH. THANKS
FOR COMING IN.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.465
SURE.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.800
THIS IS DETECTIVE MEDAVOY.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.885
HE'S ALSO WORKING
ON THE CASE.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.679
HELLO.
HOW DO YOU DO?

12:01.762 --> 12:02.930
DETECTIVE MARTINEZ.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.725
I REALIZE
HI.
YOU PROBABLY THINK

12:05.808 --> 12:08.477
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED
IN MY APARTMENT,

12:08.561 --> 12:09.645
BUT I'M A RESIDENT
AT NYU

12:09.729 --> 12:11.355
AND I HAD JUST BEEN
CALLED TO OPERATE.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.648
WE UNDERSTAND.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.816
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US

12:13.899 --> 12:15.985
ABOUT THE INCIDENT
ACROSS THE HALL?

12:16.068 --> 12:20.072
I HEARD A GUNSHOT COME
FROM THE LESBIANS' APARTMENT.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.659
I WENT TO MY PEEPHOLE
TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON

12:23.743 --> 12:25.745
AFTER, OH,
A MINUTE OR SO,

12:25.828 --> 12:27.329
THE LESBIAN WHO'S A COP

12:27.413 --> 12:29.081
CAME TO THE DOOR
AND LOOKED OUT.

12:29.165 --> 12:33.586
SHE WAS CRYING AND SCREAMED
THAT KATHY WAS DEAD.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.504
THAT'S THE OTHER LOVER.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.839
DID YOU SAY
ANYTHING TO HER?

12:36.922 --> 12:38.758
I WASN'T SURE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.342
I MEAN, IF SHE
HAD JUST USED A GUN,

12:40.426 --> 12:41.719
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
HER NEXT TARGET.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.345
OH, SO YOU JUST
KEPT WATCHING HER

12:43.429 --> 12:44.680
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE,

12:44.764 --> 12:46.682
A PREGNANT WOMAN AT RISK
FROM A MURDERER.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.227
EXCUSE ME. I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THE SITUATION WAS.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.688
AND THERE WAS CERTAINLY
NO GUNMAN IN THE HALLWAY.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.690
SO, IF YOU ASK ME,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.692
SHE WOULD BE YOUR
MOST LIKELY SUSPECT.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.445
GOD KNOWS, SHE AND
THE OTHER ONE FOUGHT ENOUGH.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.946
YOU AN EXPERT ON THAT
THROUGH YOUR PEEPHOLE?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.448
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

13:02.531 --> 13:05.451
DR. BONAN, AS CONCERNED
AS YOU UNDERSTANDABLY WERE

13:05.534 --> 13:07.620
ABOUT MIGHT BE GOING ON
IN THE HALL

13:07.703 --> 13:09.622
IN THE APARTMENT
ACROSS THE WAY,

13:09.705 --> 13:10.790
DID YOU GO RIGHT
TO YOUR PEEPHOLE

13:10.873 --> 13:12.041
WHEN YOU HEARD
THE GUNSHOT?

13:12.124 --> 13:15.377
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
BY "RIGHT TO THE PEEPHOLE."

13:15.461 --> 13:17.630
SHE MEANS,
WAS THERE AN INTERVAL

13:17.713 --> 13:18.923
BEFORE YOU LOOKED OUT?

13:19.006 --> 13:20.966
MAYBE...A MINUTE.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.221
IT'S A STRESSFUL THING
HEARING SHOTS LIKE THAT.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.639
PARTICULARLY FOR
SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF--

13:26.722 --> 13:28.933
RUNS AWAY, DOESN'T
HAVE THE DECENCY

13:29.016 --> 13:30.893
TO CALL IN WHAT HE SAW
FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

13:30.976 --> 13:31.852
GREG.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.729
AND THEN DESCRIBES
PEOPLE WITH EPITHETS.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.814
I'M REPORTING WHAT I SAW,

13:34.897 --> 13:36.440
AND I'M ENTITLED
TO MY SUSPICIONS.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.567
ABSOLUTELY, SIR.
YES, YOU ARE.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.903
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

13:40.986 --> 13:43.239
UH, NO.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.740
I APPRECIATE
YOUR COMING IN.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.747
ASSHOLE.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.458
GREG, I THINK YOU GOTTA
HOLD OPEN THE POSSIBILITY

13:54.542 --> 13:56.752
THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS
WITH ABBY'S STORY.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.170
IN WHAT REGARD?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.755
I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE
PERSONALLY

13:59.839 --> 14:00.756
IF THERE WAS A BLOOD TRAIL

14:00.840 --> 14:02.424
FROM WHERE ABBY GOT SHOT
TO THE PHONE.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.802
THERE'S A MILLION POSSIBLE
EXPLANATIONS FOR THAT.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.262
OF COURSE THERE ARE,

14:06.345 --> 14:07.763
AND THE FACT THAT THIS
JERK ACROSS THE HALL

14:07.847 --> 14:09.682
DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY
LEAVE THE APARTMENT.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.267
YOU YOURSELF ESTABLISHED A
POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THAT--

14:11.350 --> 14:12.977
THE INTERVAL BEFORE HE
WENT TO THE PEEPHOLE.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.436
YEAH, I KNOW.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.689
SO HOW CAN YOU JUMP
TO ABBY'S LYING?

14:16.772 --> 14:19.316
GREG, WE GOTTA LOOK AT
THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUARREL.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.778

MAYBE SHOT KATHY.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.821

FOR SAYING THAT, JAMES.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.617
Jill: IT'S JUST
A POSSIBILITY.

NO, I REALLY AM.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.955
DETECTIVE MEDAVOY?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.790
YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

14:34.874 --> 14:35.958
YOU CAUGHT A HOMICIDE

14:36.041 --> 14:37.376
INVOLVING A UNIFORM
IN THIS PRECINCT?

14:37.459 --> 14:38.544
UH, YEAH. ABBY SULLIVAN.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.462
WE'RE LOOKING
AT IT, ALSO.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.839
IS THAT RIGHT?

14:41.922 --> 14:43.215
SOME PEOPLE
IN THE BUILDING

14:43.299 --> 14:44.800
ARE TALKING
TO REPORTERS,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.010
SAYING THAT IT WAS
A LOVERS' QUARREL.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.972
ABBY SAYS THE PERPETRATOR
WAS A PUSH-IN STICKUP GUY.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.807
DID ABBY?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.852
THEY JUST RECOVERED
OFFICER SULLIVAN'S CAR.

14:54.935 --> 14:58.731
UH, WE SHOULD CHECK OUT
THAT CAR ANGLE.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.859
UM, OBVIOUSLY
KEEP YOU APPRISED.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.110
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.031
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
DON'T GO OVER THERE

15:07.114 --> 15:07.990
AND CHECK OUT
ABBY'S CAR WITH YOU?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.867
NO. THAT'S FINE, JAMES.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.493
CRIME SCENE PROBABLY
WON'T PROCESS IT

15:11.577 --> 15:12.703
TILL MORNING ANYWAYS.

15:12.786 --> 15:13.996
WAS THAT GINA BEFORE?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.205
YEAH. I'M CONCERNED
WITH HER.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.999
SHE'S HAVING SOME
FEMININE DIFFICULTY.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.500
SHE'S A LITTLE CONCERNED,
SO I WANT TO BE WITH HER.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.877
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.753

15:20.836 --> 15:22.671
BUT I WANT TO BE
WITH HER, AS WELL.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.381
DON'T TAKE WHAT WE WERE
SAYING WRONG, GREG.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.758
I'M SURE THERE'S AN
EXPLANATION FOR EVERYTHING.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.009
OH! YEAH, YEAH.

WE DO THAT?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.441
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A PLAN, JILL.

15:42.524 --> 15:43.901
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SNAP BEFORE.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.737

MR. AND MRS. TORELLI,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.155
THAN NOT TO HAVE
TO TELL YOU THIS.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.948
NO.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.908
YOUR CAR WAS RECOVERED.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.995
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS FOUND
DEAD INSIDE.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.164
SHE'D BEEN SHOT,

19:25.247 --> 19:28.167
AND THE CAR WAS
THEN SET ON FIRE.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.668

19:32.004 --> 19:33.755
YES, I'M AFRAID SO,
MRS. TORELLI.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.175
YOU SAID JUST
THE CAR WAS STOLEN.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.931
WHO DID IT? THE KID
I FORBADE HER TO SEE?

19:43.015 --> 19:46.351
HE IS OUR MAIN SUSPECT,
THIS SAM DePAUL.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.687
WE'D HOPED TO HAVE HIM

19:48.770 --> 19:50.606

19:50.689 --> 19:52.941
LOOK, FOLKS,
AS HARD AS IT'LL BE,

19:53.025 --> 19:54.484
IF HE DOES TRY

19:54.568 --> 19:56.945
WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOU
NOT SAYING THAT YOU KNOW

21:23.699 --> 21:26.618
AHH. WE SPENT HALF

21:26.702 --> 21:29.663
THE DOA's MOTHER PUT HER

21:38.338 --> 21:39.673
UP THERE ON--
YOU KNOW, THE CRIB.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.675
THIS IS LIKE
A MORTAR ATTACK.

21:41.758 --> 21:45.262
HEY, BOBBY. YOU LOOKIN'

21:45.345 --> 21:46.847
WHY? YOU GOT ANYTHING?

21:46.930 --> 21:48.015
HE WAS A PASSENGER

21:48.098 --> 21:49.850
IN A CAR STOP I DID
5:00 THIS MORNING.

21:49.933 --> 21:50.851
WHERE WAS THIS?

21:50.934 --> 21:53.020
HAD TO BE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF HIS PLACE.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.688
HIS BUDDY'S DRIVIN'.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.356
WHILE I'M WRITIN' HIM UP
FOR A BUSTED HEADLIGHT,

21:56.440 --> 21:59.026
THIS ONE GETS OUT,
WALKS INTO THE BUILDING.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.861
YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO SEE

22:00.944 --> 22:02.696
2 DETECTIVES SITTIN'
ON THE PLACE?

22:02.779 --> 22:04.031
YEAH, I SAW 'EM.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.116
AND THEY DON'T MOVE ON THE GUY
WHEN HE'S WALKIN' IN?

22:06.199 --> 22:09.494
WELL, UH, THEY WEREN'T
PAYIN' TOO MUCH ATTENTION.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.496
YOU GOT YOUR RACK LIGHTS ON,
AND THESE MORONS,

22:11.580 --> 22:13.457
THEY'RE SLEEPIN'
THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.792
I GUESS YOU KNOW WHERE
TO PICK THIS GUY UP.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.712
DRIVER'S NAME IS,
UH, JOE RIZOLLI.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.797
HERE'S HIS PEDIGREE.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.845
THEY'RE SLEEPIN' WHILE
THE SUSPECT IS WALKIN' IN.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.389
THOSE GUYS, THEY
COULD SLEEP FOR ANDY.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.017
AFTER I LEFT YOU
AND ANDY LAST NIGHT

22:32.100 --> 22:33.643
AND DROPPED
THAT GIRL OFF,

22:33.727 --> 22:34.895
I WENT
BY A FILLING STATION

22:34.978 --> 22:36.563
ABOUT A BLOCK FROM
THE CRIME SCENE.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.565
GUY ALMOST PASSED OUT
DENYING HE SOLD GAS

22:38.648 --> 22:40.067
IN A CONTAINER
YESTERDAY.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.069
PROBABLY THIS RIZOLLI
AND HIS PAL SAM

22:42.152 --> 22:44.321
ARE WHO HE DIDN'T
SELL IT TO.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.576
GOOD MORNING.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.037
ANDY, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.582
THAT SAM DePAUL? HE GETS TO
HIS PLACE AT 5:00 THIS MORNING,

22:55.665 --> 22:57.501
NIGHT WATCH
TOTALLY MISSES HIM.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.668
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.837
MARTELLI
FROM DOWNSTAIRS,

23:00.921 --> 23:02.756
HE PULLS OVER THIS CAR
WITH A BUSTED HEADLIGHT.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.007
DePAUL
IS THE PASSENGER.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.675
NOW, THERE'S NO WAY
THAT MARTELLI KNOWS

23:05.759 --> 23:07.094
THAT WE'RE LOOKIN'
FOR THIS GUY.

23:07.177 --> 23:10.097
SO HE LETS DePAUL OUT WHILE
HE'S WRITING THE DRIVER UP.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.015
DePAUL JUST WALKS
ACROSS THE STREET,

23:12.099 --> 23:14.184
RIGHT INTO
HIS BUILDING. BOOM.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.602
AND BOTH NIGHT WATCH GUYS
GOT THEIR HEADS

23:15.685 --> 23:17.104

23:17.187 --> 23:18.939
I DON'T KNOW
HOW ANYBODY SLEEPS

23:19.022 --> 23:21.108
ANYWHERE BUT THEIR
OWN BED, ANYWAYS.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.943
HIM AND ME, WE'RE UPSTAIRS
TRYING TO CATCH ONE HOUR

23:23.026 --> 23:24.778

23:24.861 --> 23:27.030
Fancy:
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

23:27.114 --> 23:29.408

23:29.491 --> 23:30.909

23:30.992 --> 23:32.452

23:32.536 --> 23:34.413
THEY LET HIM WALK PAST
INTO HIS HOUSE,

23:34.496 --> 23:36.081
AND THEY SNOOZE
RIGHT THROUGH IT.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.583
LET'S GO PICK HIM UP. WE
OUGHT TO GET THIS OTHER GUY

23:38.667 --> 23:40.210

23:43.380 --> 23:44.965
Martinez: HEY.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.633

23:46.716 --> 23:48.635
ACTUALLY, GINA'S NOT DOIN'

23:48.718 --> 23:50.637
SHE'S WHAT THEY CALL
SPOTTING.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.972
OH, SORRY, JAMES.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.390
Fancy: SHE SEEING
A DOCTOR?

23:53.473 --> 23:54.641
Martinez: 9:15.

23:54.724 --> 23:55.976
YOU WANT TO GO THERE, JAMES?

23:56.059 --> 23:57.477
SHE TOLD ME
TO GO TO WORK

23:57.561 --> 23:59.062
WHILE HER MOTHER TAKES
HER IN, BUT I DID THINK

23:59.146 --> 24:01.481
I'D GO OVER THERE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR'S TIME.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.983

24:03.066 --> 24:05.485

PRETTY BADLY VANDALIZED.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.987
JILL'S FOLLOWING THAT OUT.

GO PICK THIS JERK UP.

24:12.075 --> 24:15.662

FOR BACKUP ON THE OTHER GUY.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.664
I'LL HAVE A GOOD
THOUGHT, MARTINEZ.

24:17.747 --> 24:18.665
THANKS, ANDY.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.803

OF YOU, GREG.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.805
I JUST GOT WHAT
YOU USUALLY ASK FOR.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.515
I APPRECIATE IT.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.352
HOW'S YOUR ARM?

24:39.436 --> 24:41.021

24:51.615 --> 24:53.116
JILL'S ON THAT.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.038
I SHOULD TELL YOU,
ABBY, UH...

24:58.121 --> 25:00.540
YOUR CAR WAS
PRETTY BADLY VANDALIZED.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.542
STRIPPED, YOU MEAN?

25:02.626 --> 25:05.045
NO. VANDALIZED...

25:05.128 --> 25:08.048
LIKE, UH...SOMEONE
WAS ACTING IN ANGER.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.551
YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'D WANT
TO HURT YOU LIKE THAT?

25:11.635 --> 25:12.636
NO.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.391
I'VE, UH...I'VE GOT
SOME OTHER QUESTIONS

25:18.475 --> 25:19.851
IF YOU'RE UP TO IT.

25:19.935 --> 25:20.852
SURE.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.854
UM, ONE
OF YOUR NEIGHBORS

25:22.938 --> 25:26.566
SAID HE HEARD A LOT OF FIGHTING
BETWEEN YOU AND KATHY.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.318
OH, THE JERK RESIDENT
AT NYU?

25:28.401 --> 25:29.986
HE HATES US.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.240
IS IT TRUE, THOUGH? HAD YOU
AND KATHY BEEN FIGHTING?

25:33.323 --> 25:35.992
WE'D BEEN UNDER A LOT OF
STRESS 'CAUSE OF THE BABY.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.160
I'D HAVE MORNING SICKNESS,

25:37.244 --> 25:39.329
AND KATHY WOULD JUST
BE WORRIED ABOUT ME.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.747
UH-HUH.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.041
DISAGREEMENTS
ANYONE WOULD HAVE.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.751
RIGHT.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.837
GREG...KATHY AND I
LOVED EACH OTHER.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.590
WE WERE A COUPLE.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.925
AND--AND COUPLES
HAVE DISAGREEMENTS.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.885
I--I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.971
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD.

26:02.602 --> 26:05.272
ON THE OTHER HAND,
ABBY, UH...

26:05.355 --> 26:07.524
THERE'S NO WITNESSES
TO CORROBORATE YOUR STORY.

26:07.607 --> 26:08.733
CERTAIN DETAILS

26:08.817 --> 26:10.360
NOT CORROBORATED
BY THE CRIME SCENE--

26:10.443 --> 26:12.946
SAY WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING AT, GREG.

26:13.029 --> 26:16.032
LACK OF A BLOOD TRAIL
TO THE PHONE, FOR EXAMPLE,

26:16.116 --> 26:18.034
CORROBORATING YOUR ACTIONS
AFTER YOU WERE SHOT.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.786
I PRESSED MY ARM
AGAINST MY SHIRT.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.121
I SEE.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.373
ASK THE QUESTION YOU
WANT TO ASK, GREG.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.376
I THINK YOU KNOW
THE QUESTION, ABBY...

26:26.459 --> 26:29.462
IF POSSIBLY YOU
AND KATHY HAD A FIGHT,

26:29.546 --> 26:30.463
AND IN YOUR ANGER--

26:30.547 --> 26:32.299
DID I KILL HER?

26:32.382 --> 26:33.592
DID I KILL KATHY?

26:33.675 --> 26:35.302
YOU KNOW THESE TYPE CRIMES,

26:35.385 --> 26:37.220
THE SPOUSE IS ALWAYS
THE FIRST SUSPECT.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.556
NO, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THESE TYPE CRIMES!

26:39.639 --> 26:41.808
I KNOW THE PERSON
I LOVED IS DEAD.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.977
AND THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION IS NO,

26:44.060 --> 26:45.979
I DID NOT KILL HER.

26:46.062 --> 26:48.273
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.566
MY GOD, GREG.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.499
I BELIEVE WHAT
YOU'VE TOLD ME, ABBY...

27:06.583 --> 27:08.293
AS FAR AS IT GOES.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.295
BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S
MORE YOU COULD SAY

27:10.378 --> 27:12.589
ABOUT THE VANDALIZING
OF YOUR CAR.

27:16.593 --> 27:20.263
THE CAR BEIN' ON DELANCY,
THAT'S MAYBE SIGNIFICANT.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.600
OK.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.771
I HAVE AN OLD GIRLFRIEND
WHO LIVES THERE.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.856
DENISE McCALL.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.525
IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS NOW,

27:32.609 --> 27:34.527
BUT SHE TOOK US
BREAKING UP REALLY BAD.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.363
LIKE HOW?

27:36.446 --> 27:39.324
LIKE SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE ME
ALONE FOR MONTHS AFTER...

27:39.407 --> 27:41.159
CALLING, COMING OVER.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.453
IT WAS VERGING
ON STALKING.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.709
HAVE YOU SEEN HER
RECENTLY?

27:51.294 --> 27:54.547
2 WEEKS AGO, I GO INTO
THE SUBWAY, AND THERE SHE IS.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.134
OBVIOUSLY, SHE SAW
THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.512
THE LOOK ON HER FACE...

28:00.595 --> 28:02.514
DID SHE SPEAK
TO YOU AT ALL...

28:02.597 --> 28:04.182
MAKE ANY SORT
OF THREAT?

28:04.265 --> 28:06.226
NOT IN SO MANY WORDS.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.645
BUT SHE WAS REALLY UPSET...

28:08.728 --> 28:10.271
ANGRY.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.984
DO YOU THINK SHE COULD BE
INVOLVED IN THIS SOMEHOW...

28:15.068 --> 28:18.571
POSSIBLY HIRED THE GUY
THAT DID THIS?

28:18.655 --> 28:20.573
I THINK IT COULD
BE POSSIBLE.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.034
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
HE DIDN'T ROB ANYTHING.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.204
DAMN IT, ABBY! YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD ME ABOUT THIS BEFORE!

28:26.287 --> 28:27.580
I ONLY STARTED
THINKING ABOUT IT

28:27.664 --> 28:29.541
AFTER YOU TOLD ME
WHERE THE CAR WAS FOUND.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.251
A FORMER LOVER
WHO WAS STALKING YOU!

28:31.334 --> 28:32.752
YOU DIDN'T FIND THAT

28:32.836 --> 28:35.338
NO! I THOUGHT IT WAS
A PUSH-IN ROBBERY, GREG!

28:35.422 --> 28:36.589
OH, SURE.
A PUSH-IN ROBBERY

28:36.673 --> 28:38.341
WHERE NOTHIN'
HAPPENS TO GET STOLEN,

28:38.425 --> 28:40.760
BUT ONE OF THE LOVERS
MURDERED.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.721
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
TO ME LIKE THIS?

28:42.804 --> 28:44.597
IF DENISE WAS INVOLVED,

28:44.681 --> 28:46.641
I OBVIOUSLY KNEW
NOTHING ABOUT IT.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.311
YEAH.

28:51.521 --> 28:52.689
ALL RIGHT.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.363
WHAT'S THIS DENISE'S
ADDRESS?

29:04.325 --> 29:05.577
IF SHE'S NOT THERE,

29:05.660 --> 29:08.747
YOU SHOULD CHECK
AT A BAR CALLED LULA'S.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.874

29:43.239 --> 29:44.991
WITH HER PREGNANCY
BEING AT RISK,

29:45.074 --> 29:46.326
BUT NOTHING'S FOREGONE.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.995
I WAS WORRIED
WE WERE IN THE PROCESS

29:49.078 --> 29:50.914
OF, UH, THE BABY DYIN'.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.832
OH, WELL, THAT'S NOT
A FOREGONE CONCLUSION.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.585
NO. SHE HAS TO COMPLETELY
REST AND BE OFF HER FEET.

WELL, SHE
SHE HAS TO

DO THAT

29:57.587 --> 29:59.672

ON THAT FRONT, UH...

30:21.069 --> 30:22.987
IT TURNS OUT
THAT A-ABBY THINKS

BEEN SOME KIND OF, UH,

UH, SHE WASN'T AT HOME
OR THE BAR ABBY SAID.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.389

HIS PAROLE OFFICER

30:49.472 --> 30:51.558
A GOOD ADDRESS
7 WEEKS AGO.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.977
LET'S TRY THAT.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.729
THINKING ABBY'S FORMER LOVER
MIGHT'VE HIRED THE GUY?

30:56.813 --> 30:59.732
YEAH. UH...THAT'D
BE THE SCENARIO.

30:59.816 --> 31:00.817

31:09.075 --> 31:10.410

31:13.997 --> 31:15.081
THAT'S RIGHT.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.499
DID YOU CALL YOUR

31:19.168 --> 31:20.336
YEAH. I TALKED TO HER
ON THE PHONE.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.505
SHE WAS GONNA PICK ME UP,

31:42.609 --> 31:43.610
WELL, WHEN'D YOU SAY THAT?

31:43.693 --> 31:45.695
THAT MUST'VE
WENT RIGHT BY ME.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.114
HEY! HEY! YOU SHOOT
A GIRL IN THE HEAD,

32:22.565 --> 32:24.651
SHE'S PRETTY GOOD-LOOKING
FOR A DETECTIVE, ISN'T SHE?

32:24.734 --> 32:27.570
LOOKS KINDA LIKE A
CHARLIE'S ANGEL OR SOMETHING.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.659
SO NOW YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

32:37.747 --> 32:39.499
YOU KNOW

32:39.582 --> 32:42.502
YEAH. SHE USED TO DATE
A FRIEND OF MINE.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.253
YOU SEE HER LAST NIGHT?

32:44.337 --> 32:46.130
I WENT CLUBBIN'
LAST NIGHT.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.256
WITH WHO?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.925
SAM DePAUL.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.510

32:55.431 --> 32:56.516
BUT BEFORE YOU AND
SAM WENT CLUBBIN'

32:56.599 --> 32:58.685
YOU HAD A LITTLE
ADVENTURE WITH GASOLINE.

32:58.768 --> 32:59.686
EXCUSE ME?

32:59.769 --> 33:01.479
YOU HELPED SAM DePAUL

33:01.562 --> 33:03.648

BODY IN HER CAR, JOE.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.358
THAT PUTS YOU
IN A BAD SPOT.

33:05.441 --> 33:06.693
SEE, THAT DON'T
PUT ME NOWHERE.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.528
I DIDN'T KNOW NOTHIN'
ABOUT NO FIRE.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.405
ARE--ARE YOU
A DUMMY, JOE?

33:11.614 --> 33:14.701
YOU WANT TO BE LOCKED UP
FOR LIFE OVER THIS?

33:14.784 --> 33:17.829
YOU, JOE RIZOLLI, THE
ACCESSORY TO MURDER?

33:17.912 --> 33:19.539
LISTEN TO ME. LOOK,

33:19.622 --> 33:21.958
I DIDN'T KNOW NOTHIN'
ABOUT NO GASOLINE.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.670
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS,

33:25.753 --> 33:26.713
SAM CALLED
TO PICK HIM UP.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.673
I GET THERE, AND HE--

33:28.756 --> 33:31.134
HE'S GOT THIS PEPSI
BOTTLE FULL OF GAS.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.720
I SAID, "I'LL TAKE YOU
WHERE YOU WANT TO GO,

33:33.803 --> 33:34.971
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO KNOW NOTHIN'

33:35.054 --> 33:37.724
ABOUT THAT PEPSI BOTTLE."
SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.684
I TOOK HIM
WHERE HE WANTED.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.686

AROUND THE CORNER

WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

33:57.785 --> 34:02.415

HE GOT OUT OF THE CAR...

34:02.498 --> 34:04.333

34:04.417 --> 34:06.669
THEN HERE COMES SAM
RUNNIN' BACK.

THAT SMART-ASS ATTITUDE

ABOUT THE GASOLINE.

IT HAD YOUR PRINTS.

37:10.519 --> 37:13.105
NO. THE CUTTING UP
IS ON SOMEONE ELSE.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.402
SHE PLANNED
THIS WHOLE THING.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.403
WHO'S TEQUILA?

37:19.487 --> 37:20.696
A FRIEND.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.281
HE KNOWS THE NUT JOB
FROM THAT BAR LULA'S,

37:22.365 --> 37:23.282
WHERE THEY MET.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.867
SHE'S A DYKE.

37:24.951 --> 37:25.660
WHO'S A DYKE?

37:25.743 --> 37:26.911
DENISE WHO HIRED ME.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.080
SHE WANTED SOMEONE
TO TAKE OUT THE OTHER DYKE.

37:29.163 --> 37:30.623
SO TEQUILA SAYS
"I KNOW WHO YOU CAN GET."

37:30.706 --> 37:31.791
SHE PUTS ME WITH HER.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.626
BUT I WASN'T GONNA DO IT.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.712
I JUST WANTED TO GET A LITTLE
ROBBERY OUT OF IT FOR MYSELF.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.089
THEN I GET ATTACKED.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.132
SO WHAT HAPPENED
WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.884
YOU WANT TO LOOK
AT MY SHEET?

37:41.968 --> 37:43.636
I GOT ONE THING ON THERE
WITH A KNIFE.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.304
THAT WAS ALSO SELF-DEFENSE.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.640
SO, YOU WERE GONNA
DOUBLE-CROSS DENISE,

37:47.723 --> 37:49.600
TAKE HER MONEY,
BUT--BUT NOT DO THE MURDER.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.726
SHE'S A DYKE.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.104
THE TWO RUNNING AROUND
THE APARTMENT,

37:53.187 --> 37:54.230
DYKES, TOO.

37:54.313 --> 37:55.815
Martinez:
YEAH, WE KNOW THAT.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.066
SO WHAT DID
DENISE SAY TO DO?

37:57.149 --> 37:58.818
KILL THE ONE
WHO AIN'T PREGNANT,

37:58.901 --> 38:00.111
TAKE THE CAR,

38:00.194 --> 38:01.612
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
A ROBBERY.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.656
SHE KNEW THEIR SCHEDULE,

38:03.739 --> 38:05.116
WHEN THEY WENT SHOPPING,

38:05.199 --> 38:06.492
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

38:06.575 --> 38:08.619
SO, YOU, UH,
YOU FOLLOWED 'EM HOME,

38:08.703 --> 38:09.620
BUSTED INTO THE APARTMENT--

38:09.704 --> 38:11.622
AND WAS GONNA ROB 'EM,

38:11.706 --> 38:13.124
AND THEN
THERE WAS COMPLICATIONS,

38:13.207 --> 38:15.626
'CAUSE DENISE, WHO ACTS
LIKE SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING,

38:15.710 --> 38:18.838
DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN' ABOUT THERE
BEING A GUN IN THE HOUSE.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.089
THE ONE
I'M SUPPOSED TO SHOOT--

38:20.172 --> 38:21.424
KATHY.

38:21.507 --> 38:22.591
THE ONE
WHO AIN'T PREGNANT.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.303
SHE GOES INTO A DESK DRAWER,
GETS A GUN.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.596
NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT?

38:27.680 --> 38:29.181
THAT IS AN ACT
OF SELF-DEFENSE.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.183
SO YOU AND SELF-DEFENSE
ARE, LIKE, BEST FRIENDS.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.019
I WAS NEVER
RAISING A GUN TO THEM

38:33.102 --> 38:35.104
UNTIL SHE GOT ONE HERSELF.

38:35.187 --> 38:38.441
<i>I </i>TOLD THE OTHER ONE
TO GO IN THE BEDROOM.

38:38.524 --> 38:39.608
WAS GONNA GRAB
THE LOOT I COULD GET

38:39.692 --> 38:41.027
AND BE DONE WITH IT.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.112
BUT THEN THE TOUGH ONE'S
GOTTA RUN, GET A GUN,

38:43.195 --> 38:44.655
TURN THE WHOLE THING
INTO A SHOOTOUT.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.616
BUT SHE DIDN'T
GET A SHOT OFF AT YOU.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.118
NO.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.787
TURNS OUT
I'M THE QUICKER DRAW.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.042
LOOK...

38:56.125 --> 38:59.962
WHO YOU'RE AFTER
IS THIS DENISE.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.882
SHE IS JUST THIS SIDE
OF CRAZY.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.051
SO WHERE DO WE FIND HER?

39:05.134 --> 39:07.720
I'D TRY LULA'S.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.388
OR WHERE SHE LIVES.

39:10.890 --> 39:11.807
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

39:11.891 --> 39:12.975
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

39:17.146 --> 39:18.022
WHAT'S UP?

39:18.105 --> 39:19.398
YEAH, UM...

39:19.482 --> 39:21.025
ABBY JUST CALLED.

39:21.108 --> 39:22.526
DENISE McCALL IS SITTING
ACROSS THE STREET

39:22.610 --> 39:23.736
FROM HER APARTMENT.

39:23.819 --> 39:24.612
IS SHE ARMED?

39:24.695 --> 39:25.571
I DON'T KNOW.

39:25.654 --> 39:27.031
BUT YOU'D BETTER
GET OVER THERE.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.075
HANK WILL TAKE CARE
OF THIS GUY. HANK?

39:29.158 --> 39:30.576
UH...SO, MY SITUATION?

39:30.659 --> 39:32.411
Martinez:
I DON'T KNOW, TOMMY.

39:32.495 --> 39:33.913
YOU JUST ADMIT
YOU SHOT A WOMAN DEAD.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.082
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN JUST
LET WALK RIGHT AWAY.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.959
I TOLD YOU
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

39:45.674 --> 39:49.762
Woman: PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT
TO THE DREAMS OF THEIR LIVES,

39:49.845 --> 39:50.679
AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT

39:50.763 --> 39:51.847
TO THE COURAGE
OF SEEKING HAPPINESS.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.099
Greg: HOW WOULD THAT
APPLY TO THIS?

39:53.182 --> 39:54.600
THE INSTANCE
OF ABBY'S...

39:54.683 --> 39:57.103
[WOMAN TALKING]

39:57.186 --> 39:58.604
Greg: YEAH, WE WOULD.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.566
ABBY AND I WERE THE ONES
TALKING ABOUT HAVING A BABY.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.777
WE WERE THE ONES
MADE PLANS FOR OUR FAMILY.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.612
THEN COMES
THE INTERLOPER.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.947
MEANING KATHY.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.907
PEOPLE PRESCRIBE THEIR
OWN TRAGEDIES, YOU KNOW.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.450
IF EVERYONE
HAD JUST BEHAVED,

40:11.534 --> 40:12.701
SHE'D BE ALIVE,

40:12.785 --> 40:14.620
AND I'D BE LOOKING
AT MOTHERHOOD.

40:14.703 --> 40:15.913
NOW KATHY'S DEAD.

40:15.996 --> 40:18.040
BUT YOU'RE STILL NOT ON YOUR WAY
TO HAVING A BABY.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.208
Denise: THAT'S OK.

40:19.291 --> 40:21.127
DOOR'S OPEN
FOR ABBY AND ME NOW.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.628
YOU'RE WAY OFF, DENISE.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.422
SHE DOESN'T WANT
NOTHIN' TO DO WITH YOU.

40:24.505 --> 40:27.091
WELL, WITHOUT THE WANNABE
NOVELIST IN THE PICTURE

40:27.174 --> 40:28.634
WHO WRITES LIKE CRAP--

40:28.717 --> 40:29.802
AND I SHOULD KNOW,

40:29.885 --> 40:30.803
'CAUSE I WAS AT ONE
OF HER PATHETIC READINGS--

40:30.886 --> 40:32.304
YOU FOLLOWED 'EM AROUND,
DIDN'T YOU?

40:32.388 --> 40:33.764
I DID MY HOMEWORK.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.057
YOU FOLLOWED 'EM UNTIL
YOU KNEW THEIR PATTERNS,

40:35.141 --> 40:37.059
AND THEN YOU STUCK
THIS TOMMY ON 'EM.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.812
I HAD HIM PUT PEOPLE
IN THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACES.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.148
WAS IT YOU TORE UP
ABBY'S CAR?

40:42.231 --> 40:44.483
IN A FIT OF LOVE.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.651
OH, YEAH.

40:45.734 --> 40:49.155
YOU GIVE ME ALL
THE WEIRD LOOKS YOU WANT, OK?

40:49.238 --> 40:52.450
BUT SHE'S GONNA
COME AROUND NOW.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.577
FEELING AS STRONGLY
AS YOU DO, DENISE,

40:54.660 --> 40:55.995
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

40:56.078 --> 40:57.580
YOUR SIDE OF IT
GETS ON RECORD.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.081
MAYBE STARTING WITH
HIRING THIS TOMMY LANG

40:59.165 --> 41:00.624
TO KILL KATHY.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.002
OH, GEE, I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK.

41:03.085 --> 41:07.673
THEN WE CAN STACK MY WRITING
UP AGAINST HERS.

Martinez:
SO, UH, DENISE,

41:15.931 --> 41:17.600
DO YOU WANT TO PUT
AN END TO THIS?

Denise:
ABBY AND I...

[VOICES CONTINUE]

41:33.115 --> 41:37.703
DOESN'T SHOW
AN OUNCE OF REMORSE.

41:37.786 --> 41:40.539
I'D NEVER SAY IT
IN COURT, BUT...

41:40.623 --> 41:41.790
DENISE
HAS CROSSED THE LINE

41:41.874 --> 41:44.043
OF NOT UNDERSTANDING
RIGHT AND WRONG.

41:44.126 --> 41:47.546
SHE'S NOT
THE PERSON YOU KNEW.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.382
SHE WAS JEALOUS WHENEVER
WE WERE TOGETHER.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.551
POSSESSIVE OF MY TIME.

41:52.635 --> 41:56.055
OF WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

41:56.138 --> 41:59.892
FIRST, I WAS JUST
SO GLAD TO BE LOVED.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.231
WHEN I KNEW IT WAS OVER,

42:05.314 --> 42:07.066
WE WENT TO COUNSELING
FOR 6 MONTHS

42:07.149 --> 42:09.235
TO HELP HER GET READY.

42:09.318 --> 42:12.154
I KNEW NOTHING WAS GONNA
GET HER OVER IT.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.240
FINALLY, I JUST LEFT...

42:14.323 --> 42:17.243
CUT OUT EVERY
PART OF MY LIFE

42:17.326 --> 42:18.577
WHERE DENISE
WAS INVOLVED

42:18.661 --> 42:20.246
SO SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO SEE ME,

42:20.329 --> 42:23.249
TRY TO KEEP FROM
HURTING HER.

42:23.332 --> 42:24.542
EVEN BEFORE
KATHY AND I MET

42:24.625 --> 42:28.045
AND DENISE REALLY
STARTED STALKING US,

42:28.128 --> 42:30.256
I'D FEEL HER
FOLLOWING ME

42:30.339 --> 42:33.676
LIKE SOME...
HAUNTED SPIRIT.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.094

42:35.177 --> 42:38.347

THAT WAY MYSELF.
