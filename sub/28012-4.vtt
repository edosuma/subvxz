Ah, I just figured
you were seeing someone new.

41:49.043 --> 41:50.576
There's a guy.

41:50.613 --> 41:52.538
A guy? [CHUCKLES]

41:53.228 --> 41:54.627
I'm not surprised.

41:54.712 --> 41:56.462
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- You like him?

41:57.384 --> 41:58.698
I do.

41:59.197 --> 42:00.936
So, what do you want... my permission?

42:01.535 --> 42:02.663
You don't me owe anything.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.621
You know, we had a thing,
but it's cool.

42:04.658 --> 42:05.939
Uh, it was more than a thing.

42:05.976 --> 42:07.801
You were the first love of my life.

42:09.118 --> 42:10.893
It was all right.

42:13.924 --> 42:15.657
You love him?

42:16.062 --> 42:17.400
[CHUCKLES] No.

42:17.437 --> 42:20.386
It's way too early for all that.
[CLEARS THROAT]

42:20.423 --> 42:22.750
Mainly, I just feel stupid
around him all the time.

42:23.051 --> 42:24.442
What do you mean?

42:24.595 --> 42:26.148
I don't know. I'm always a...

42:26.728 --> 42:28.705
afraid I'm gonna say the wrong thing,

42:28.802 --> 42:30.444
laugh at the wrong time.

42:30.818 --> 42:33.150
I don't know how
to be myself around him.

42:33.396 --> 42:35.361
Never did this before.

42:37.774 --> 42:40.584
WREN: Just relax.
Don't think about it too much.

42:41.930 --> 42:43.791
He's a guy. He probably
doesn't notice anyway.

42:43.853 --> 42:46.433
[BOTH LAUGH]

42:50.370 --> 42:52.646
It was never awkward with us.

42:54.129 --> 42:56.363
We spent a long time together.

42:58.345 --> 43:00.813
Those were the best years of my life.
