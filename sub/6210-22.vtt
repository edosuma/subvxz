00:01.867 --> 00:03.701
Hilda, this kitten
could use some mittens.

00:03.702 --> 00:04.936
I made you
a turtleneck,

00:04.937 --> 00:06.304
and you haven't
worn it once.

00:06.305 --> 00:07.271
I love that sweater.

00:07.272 --> 00:09.340
I shredded it
in less than an hour.

00:09.341 --> 00:12.277
I can't get through
<i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

00:12.278 --> 00:13.845
Can someone please
tell me what happens,

00:13.846 --> 00:15.046
so I can write
my book report?

00:15.047 --> 00:17.148
Oh, honey,
don't take a shortcut.

00:17.149 --> 00:18.349
You need to discover
the love

00:18.350 --> 00:20.551
between Catherine
and Heathcliff on your own.

00:20.552 --> 00:22.120
You're right.

00:22.121 --> 00:23.287
Aunt Hilda?

00:23.288 --> 00:24.356
Sorry. Never read it.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.623
Emily Bronte bugged me.

00:25.624 --> 00:26.892
She was in my English class,

00:26.893 --> 00:29.527
and she always thought
she was so brilliant.

00:29.528 --> 00:33.064
I know a way
I can find out on my own.

00:33.065 --> 00:34.365
<i>Take me into the book</i>

00:34.366 --> 00:36.267
<i>Knowing what happens</i>
<i>would be heaven</i>

00:36.268 --> 00:38.069
<i>Flip ahead to page 211</i>

00:40.706 --> 00:42.373
Heathcliff!

00:42.374 --> 00:44.509
Heathcliff!

00:44.510 --> 00:46.545
Dang, these moors are cold.

00:47.579 --> 00:48.813
All right.

00:48.814 --> 00:51.049
You're right.
I'll read the book.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.952
I tried to warn you:
no shortcuts.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.821
Did Heathcliff
ask about me?

00:59.224 --> 01:01.158

only you can prevent laughter.

01:19.478 --> 01:21.012
( <i>mellow theme playing</i> )

01:21.013 --> 01:23.648
Oh, stupid
crossword puzzle!

01:23.649 --> 01:25.583
This is not gonna turn out ugly

01:25.584 --> 01:27.618
like that tic-tac-toe
incident, is it?

01:27.619 --> 01:29.053
You know,
despite my dating history,

01:29.054 --> 01:31.122
I can't think of a word
for a male turkey.

01:31.123 --> 01:32.156
Coffee!

01:32.157 --> 01:33.925
No, something
with three letters.

01:33.926 --> 01:36.628
I stayed up all night
finishing my book report

01:36.629 --> 01:37.929
without any shortcuts.

01:37.930 --> 01:39.197
Good girl.

01:39.198 --> 01:40.197
( rubbery squeaking )

01:41.634 --> 01:42.734
I know I'm sleep-deprived,

01:42.735 --> 01:45.370
but is Aunt Hilda
cleaning her ears with rope?

01:45.371 --> 01:46.938
It's mental floss.
it clears your mind.

01:46.939 --> 01:49.907
Plus, gives you a quick burst
of temporary knowledge.

01:49.908 --> 01:52.076
Ew! I wish you'd
do that in private.

01:52.077 --> 01:54.712
Of course.
A male turkey is a tom.

01:54.713 --> 01:56.014
Thank you, mental floss.

01:56.015 --> 01:58.282
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I believe that is a shortcut.

01:58.283 --> 01:59.784
Technically, yes,
but it gives your mind

01:59.785 --> 02:01.219
a minty-fresh feeling.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.387
( marching band music playing )

02:03.388 --> 02:04.889
Did Salem join
a marching band?

02:04.890 --> 02:06.191
Anything's possible.

02:06.192 --> 02:09.092
Yesterday, he wanted to be
a June Taylor dancer.

02:09.094 --> 02:10.562
It's election time

02:10.562 --> 02:12.297
in the Other Realm!

02:14.500 --> 02:18.003
I want you...to vote.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.271
And I want you
to stop calling me.

02:21.473 --> 02:22.841
Was that Uncle Sam?

02:22.842 --> 02:25.376
Uh, in the Other Realm,
he's known as Uncle Roy.

02:25.377 --> 02:26.811
We're not sure why.
Mm.

02:26.812 --> 02:29.113
Hey! There's a proposition
that would make it legal

02:29.114 --> 02:31.516
to tell your mortal boyfriend
about your magic.

02:31.517 --> 02:33.117
It's too bad
I'm not old enough to vote.

02:33.118 --> 02:34.252
Oh, honey, you are.

02:34.253 --> 02:36.187
In the Other Realm,
the voting age is 17.

02:36.188 --> 02:37.455
Really?

02:37.456 --> 02:38.857
I feel so grown-up.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.024
¶ I get to vote ¶

02:40.025 --> 02:41.526
¶ I get to vote ¶

02:41.527 --> 02:42.894
And I don't.

02:42.895 --> 02:44.095
Salem, you're
a convicted felon.

02:44.997 --> 02:47.131
Not to mention a cat.

02:47.132 --> 02:49.734
But I wanted to vote to change
the pronunciation of Friday

02:49.735 --> 02:52.103
to "Fridyah."

02:52.104 --> 02:54.005
Hey, if this boyfriend
proposition passes,

02:54.006 --> 02:55.473
I could tell Harvey
everything.

02:55.474 --> 02:57.008
Well, except for the fact

02:57.009 --> 02:59.177
that I don't really care
that Michael Jordan retired.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.544
And I can tell
my honey, Hank,

03:00.545 --> 03:01.779
that I'm a witch.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.715
Your first date's
not until tonight.

03:03.716 --> 03:04.816
He's already your honey?

03:04.817 --> 03:06.651
It's called optimism.

03:06.652 --> 03:08.386
Look, there's an orientation
this afternoon

03:08.387 --> 03:10.855
for first-time voters. I get
to choose a political party.

03:10.856 --> 03:13.057
Oh, well, I hope
you'll join mine:

03:13.058 --> 03:15.493
the Social Democratic
Do-Gooder Party.

03:15.494 --> 03:17.328
No, join my party.
It's called the Party Party.

03:17.329 --> 03:19.297
Our slogan is: "Party!"

03:21.500 --> 03:23.735
Will you help me?
I'm not a very good seamstress.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.203
Well, then it was
kind of an odd choice

03:25.204 --> 03:27.072
for you to volunteer
for the costume committee.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.205
It's for the church play.

03:28.206 --> 03:29.707
It's the Lord's work.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.309
Okay, well,
I'm busy after school today,

03:31.310 --> 03:33.044
but I can help you
and the Lord tomorrow.

03:33.045 --> 03:35.380
Yes. Your girlfriend
is a saint.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.315
Are you tired from working
on your book report too?

03:37.316 --> 03:39.517
No. For once
I finished early.

03:39.518 --> 03:41.152
I'm tired because...

03:41.687 --> 03:42.753
( sighs )

03:42.754 --> 03:43.988
My mom's in her third trimester,

03:43.989 --> 03:45.590
the baby's pushing
against her bladder,

03:45.591 --> 03:48.058
and the toilet-flushing
is keeping me up all night.

03:48.059 --> 03:49.995
Well, I thought you made a bed
out of fertilizer bags

03:49.996 --> 03:51.729
in the garage.
I did.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.164
My dad's using it.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.234
You know, I can
tell you anything.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.003
I hope you feel
the same way.

03:59.238 --> 04:00.572
I will.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.006
Very soon.

04:02.007 --> 04:02.974
All right, everybody,

04:02.975 --> 04:04.142
take a seat,

04:04.143 --> 04:06.344
so we can talk
about the issues.

04:06.345 --> 04:08.313
I assume that everyone here

04:08.314 --> 04:10.614
has figured out
your family secret...

04:10.615 --> 04:11.516
What?

04:11.517 --> 04:13.751
...because, as absolutely
everyone knows,

04:13.752 --> 04:16.654
if you haven't solved
your family secret,

04:16.654 --> 04:18.389
you can't vote.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.423
What?

04:19.423 --> 04:20.357
So just as a formality,

04:20.358 --> 04:21.358
let's have a show of hands.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.560
Those who have.

04:22.561 --> 04:24.729
And those who haven't.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.800
Oh, come on,
I can't be the only one.

04:29.801 --> 04:31.235
I've just about got it.

04:31.236 --> 04:33.671
I've started taking
ginkoba. Want some?

04:33.672 --> 04:35.140
No.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.075
Are they chewable?

04:37.076 --> 04:38.142
Zellie,
will you do my hair?

04:38.143 --> 04:39.977
When we were young girls
in our early hundreds,

04:39.978 --> 04:41.312
I liked the way you fixed it.

04:41.313 --> 04:42.680
Oh, all right.

04:42.681 --> 04:44.582
( <i>harpsichord theme playing</i> )

04:44.583 --> 04:45.783
Oh!

04:45.784 --> 04:48.452
I haven't worn this
since I was almost beheaded.

04:48.453 --> 04:49.754
Why didn't you guys
tell me you have to

04:49.755 --> 04:51.756
solve your family secret
before you can vote?

04:51.757 --> 04:53.691
Well, that's new.
You used to only have to know

04:53.692 --> 04:55.059
how to work a toaster.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.861
What a surprise.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.030
A witch rule that works
to my disadvantage.

04:59.031 --> 05:00.331
Sabrina, don't worry.

05:00.332 --> 05:02.633
You'll figure out the family
secret in time to vote.

05:02.634 --> 05:04.535
How many clues have you solved?

05:04.536 --> 05:06.003
Wait a minute
while I add them up.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.873
One.

05:08.874 --> 05:11.108
Sabrina, I had no idea
you were so slow.

05:11.109 --> 05:12.143
I-- I mean, um--

05:12.144 --> 05:13.345
Behind.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.647
I think you could use a tutor.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.014
Well, that's not a bad idea.

05:17.015 --> 05:18.983
I'm really ready
to buckle down.

05:18.984 --> 05:20.685
Bring on a professional.

05:20.686 --> 05:23.288
Hello, I'm Mr. Saberhagen,

05:23.289 --> 05:24.589
and you may refer to me

05:24.590 --> 05:27.358
as "Mr. Saberhagen."

05:27.359 --> 05:29.394
How did I end up
with <i>you</i> as my tutor?

05:29.395 --> 05:30.928
Hey, I solved
my family secret

05:30.929 --> 05:32.029
with only two clues.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.765
Now, let's turn
to the puzzle board.

05:34.766 --> 05:36.434
Let's remove
the dirty clothes

05:36.435 --> 05:37.801
from the puzzle board.

05:37.802 --> 05:40.038
That's not a StairMaster,
young lady.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.475
Okay, well,
I know this clue:

05:44.476 --> 05:47.145
Spellman, so the family secret
must be about us.

05:47.146 --> 05:48.045
Look out, Harvard.

05:48.046 --> 05:49.146
Let's begin
at the beginning.

05:49.147 --> 05:50.849
First clue.
What is it?

05:52.150 --> 05:53.618
Chickens?
Chickens?

05:53.619 --> 05:55.085
Do they look
like chickens?

05:55.086 --> 05:56.487
Next clue.

05:56.488 --> 05:59.324
Okay. M plus a picture of fire.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.158
M plus fire...

06:01.159 --> 06:02.193
I've got it!

06:02.194 --> 06:03.594
M'fire.

06:03.595 --> 06:05.864
Right! M'fire.
That makes so much sense.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.065
Let's use it
in a sentence:

06:07.066 --> 06:09.333
"Run, run,
the house is on m'fire."

06:09.334 --> 06:10.635
I've got a better one:

06:10.636 --> 06:11.902
"You're m'fired."

06:11.903 --> 06:13.104
You can't m'fire me.

06:13.105 --> 06:14.505
I m'quit.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.576
( magical ping )

06:18.577 --> 06:20.644
Oh, more
campaign flyers.

06:20.645 --> 06:23.147
Yes, I'm definitely voting
to save the magical ping.

06:23.148 --> 06:24.649
Who'd want to change it
to a ding?

06:24.650 --> 06:25.884
Me. I'm sick of the ping.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.351
I'd love to hear a ding.

06:27.352 --> 06:28.753
But the ping has such a ring.

06:28.754 --> 06:29.787
But the ding has zing.

06:29.788 --> 06:31.923
I can't discuss politics
with you.

06:33.959 --> 06:36.227
So, Hank, tell me about you.

06:36.228 --> 06:37.262
Well, let's see...

06:37.263 --> 06:38.929
I collect jaguars.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.164
Jaguars?

06:40.165 --> 06:41.499
Be right back.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.900
Sure, foxy lady.

06:46.238 --> 06:47.204
( rubbery squeaking )

06:48.841 --> 06:49.907
All right.

06:49.908 --> 06:51.275
Okay, what were
we talking about?

06:51.276 --> 06:53.611
Oh, yes. Jaguars.

06:53.612 --> 06:55.779
Do you know that my favorite
is the Vicarage

06:55.780 --> 06:57.415
with the 3.4 liter XK engine

06:57.416 --> 06:59.550
with 4-speed transmission
and electric overdrive--

06:59.551 --> 07:02.153
Hilda, I collect jaguars,

07:02.154 --> 07:03.487
as in cats.

07:03.488 --> 07:06.090
Oh, be right back.

07:06.091 --> 07:07.325
( huffs )

07:07.326 --> 07:09.526
I guess I have to go back
to Salem and grovel.

07:09.527 --> 07:10.662
( sighs )

07:10.663 --> 07:12.563
Ooh, a brain teaser.

07:12.564 --> 07:13.765
Heart minus L?

07:13.766 --> 07:16.133
Heart means love, and love minus
the L would be: of. Ha.

07:17.836 --> 07:20.038
I guess my groveling days
are over.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.373
Mrs. Quick,
I was just wondering

07:22.374 --> 07:24.341
how you solved
that clue so fast.

07:24.342 --> 07:26.010
Well, actually...

07:27.512 --> 07:28.979
I'm addicted
to game shows.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.515
Well, at least
it's legal.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.750
I went to
a 12-step meeting for help.

07:32.751 --> 07:34.252
It was fun.
They give you clues,

07:34.253 --> 07:36.955
and you had to solve when and
where the meetings were held.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.789
It wasn't the best way
to kick the habit.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.625
Oh, well, I've got
this new game at home.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.894
It's called, um,
"Guess the Family Secret."

07:42.895 --> 07:44.295
You wanna come over
and try it?

07:44.296 --> 07:45.563
Well, I really shouldn't.

07:45.564 --> 07:48.499
It's been a long, hard road
staying clean.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.634
Oh, well, come on.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.636
You can always be
a social game player.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.138
Well, I usually watch
<i>Little House</i> reruns

07:54.139 --> 07:55.706
after school, but...

07:55.707 --> 07:58.209
What the heck.
I have 'em all on DVD. Heh-heh.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.813
Hey, Sabrina, you ready
to help me with my costumes?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.414
Oh, no,
I totally forgot.

08:03.415 --> 08:04.815
I made other plans.

08:04.816 --> 08:07.418
Oh, okay, Sabrina.
I'll meet you at your house.

08:07.419 --> 08:10.120
I can't wait to see
your new game. Heh.

08:10.121 --> 08:12.022
You're having
Mrs. Quick over to play?

08:12.023 --> 08:15.192
Harvey! You'd do
anything for me, right?

08:15.193 --> 08:17.094
I'm not feathering
my hair again.

08:17.095 --> 08:19.663
No, I want you to help Valerie
out with her costumes.

08:19.664 --> 08:21.432
What can I do?

08:24.569 --> 08:27.171
I am not going to twirl.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.607
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Vote yes on Prop. 2,000,002.</i>

08:29.608 --> 08:32.643
<i>It's time to stop the growing</i>
<i>abuse of mental floss.</i>

08:32.644 --> 08:34.010
<i>Paid for</i>
<i>by the Witches Who Want To Stop</i>

08:34.011 --> 08:35.379
<i>The Growing Abuse</i>
<i>Of Mental Floss.</i>

08:35.380 --> 08:37.581
That's ridiculous.
That'll never pass.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.716
It will if I have something
to say about it.

08:39.717 --> 08:42.219
Mental floss
encourages lazy habits,

08:42.220 --> 08:45.056
and even your mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.724
I'm going right now
to campaign for the cause.

08:47.725 --> 08:50.061
It is every witch's
right to floss,

08:50.062 --> 08:51.361
and I will fight
for that right

08:51.362 --> 08:53.330
with every fiber
of my being.

08:53.331 --> 08:55.866
But first, another
date with Hank.

08:55.867 --> 08:56.834
Mmm.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.337
Salem, are my aunts home?

08:59.338 --> 09:01.438
Hilda and Zelda
have left the building.

09:01.439 --> 09:02.540
Excellent.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.075
Keep watch and warn me
if they come home.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.009
Ooh! Throwing
a crazy party,

09:06.010 --> 09:08.746
complete with trash-can punch
and spit swapping?

09:08.747 --> 09:11.415
No, I'm having
my Algebra teacher over.

09:11.416 --> 09:12.516
( laughing ):
Yeah, right.

09:12.517 --> 09:14.585
How pathetic would that be...?

09:14.586 --> 09:16.120
Oh, you're serious.

09:16.121 --> 09:17.321
( knocking on door )
Yoo-hoo?

09:17.322 --> 09:18.455
Oh, come on in.

09:20.292 --> 09:21.726
A cat...

09:21.727 --> 09:23.694
eating a banana.

09:23.695 --> 09:25.429
How strange.

09:25.430 --> 09:27.332
Oh, uh, he's part chimp
on his mother's side.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.699
Wait here.
I'll go set up the game.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.571
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Mrs. Quick, come on down.</i>

09:33.572 --> 09:35.072
( game show music playing )

09:36.675 --> 09:39.177
This is the best
at-home version

09:39.178 --> 09:40.611
I've ever seen.

09:40.612 --> 09:42.413
Okay, well, let's take
our places and get started.

09:42.414 --> 09:43.947
( buzzing )

09:43.948 --> 09:46.216
Is this a genuine
Goodson-Todman buzzer?

09:46.217 --> 09:47.751
( buzzing )
Let's get started.

09:47.752 --> 09:49.453
We don't know
how much time we've got.

09:49.454 --> 09:51.422
Look at the microphone.

09:51.423 --> 09:53.491
Oh, look at my name!

09:53.492 --> 09:54.525
Look at the clues.

09:54.526 --> 09:56.226
There's even a glass of water.

09:56.227 --> 09:58.061
Neat.

09:58.062 --> 10:00.164
I've got to
move things along.

10:00.165 --> 10:01.498
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And here's our host,</i>

10:01.499 --> 10:02.667
<i>Monty Hall.</i>

10:02.668 --> 10:03.834
( cheering and applause )

10:03.835 --> 10:05.770
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.240
Monty Hall?!

10:09.241 --> 10:10.274
You pay a little extra.

10:10.275 --> 10:11.342
Oh!

10:11.343 --> 10:14.345
It's time to guess
the family secret.

10:14.346 --> 10:15.413
Let's solve the puzzle.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.315
But before we do,
a word with our contestants.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.784
Uh, Mrs. Quick, tell us
something about yourself.

10:19.785 --> 10:23.021
Well, I was born
in Terre Haute, Indiana,

10:23.022 --> 10:25.289
and a lot of people
don't know this, Monty,

10:25.290 --> 10:28.626
but it's the stewed-fruit
capital of the United States.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.428
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
First clue.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.096
Look, I didn't take that
from little old ladies

10:32.097 --> 10:34.164
in chicken suits, so I'm not
gonna take it from you.

10:34.165 --> 10:35.532
All right?

10:35.533 --> 10:37.402
First clue. Sabrina?

10:37.403 --> 10:38.368
( buzzing )

10:38.369 --> 10:40.337
Pass.
Oh. Eh-heh.

10:40.338 --> 10:41.839
Mmm, birds in a house...

10:41.840 --> 10:43.808
Uh, birdhouse
would be too obvious.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.143
So, what else do you call that?

10:45.144 --> 10:47.444
Oh, an aviary.
Aviary?

10:47.445 --> 10:49.346
Yeah, but aviary
doesn't make any sense,

10:49.347 --> 10:51.015
so it must be a word
that sounds like aviary.

10:51.016 --> 10:52.483
Oh!
( buzzes )

10:52.484 --> 10:53.617
"Every."

10:53.618 --> 10:54.551
( dinging )

10:54.552 --> 10:55.486
( audience cheering )

10:56.922 --> 10:58.723
Next clue now.
Sabrina?

10:58.724 --> 11:00.124
( buzzing )
Pass.

11:01.393 --> 11:02.593
Uh, let me see.

11:02.594 --> 11:04.494
"M plus fire"

11:04.495 --> 11:05.495
eq--

11:06.498 --> 11:07.798
Sabrina.

11:07.799 --> 11:08.665
Aunt Zelda!

11:10.168 --> 11:11.835
You're just in time
for the bonus round.

11:14.306 --> 11:15.806
Well, can't we finish the game?

11:15.807 --> 11:17.407
I've got the fever.

11:17.408 --> 11:18.842
I'm hot!

11:21.413 --> 11:23.281
Okay, well, I'll just
get started on that novel.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.017
Sabrina,
what were you thinking?

11:26.018 --> 11:28.719
That I could avoid this ugly
scene that's about to happen.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.522
Sabrina, using a shortcut
to solve your family secret

11:31.523 --> 11:33.591
can have serious
consequences.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.459
I just wanna be
able to vote.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.561
And Mrs. Quick
is really lonely.

11:37.562 --> 11:39.863
You leave me no choice
but to punish you.

11:39.864 --> 11:42.066
<i>To learn the error</i>
<i>of her ways</i>

11:42.067 --> 11:45.436
<i>No shortcuts</i>
<i>for one days</i>

11:45.437 --> 11:47.337
And might I say,
nice rhyme.

11:47.338 --> 11:50.875
That means no modern
conveniences for 24 hours.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.610
And if you try something
like this again

11:52.611 --> 11:54.112
the Witches' Council
will intervene,

11:54.113 --> 11:55.646
and they're a lot
more strict than I am.

11:55.647 --> 11:57.881
Now clean up this mess.

11:57.882 --> 12:01.085
And I was hoping Family Secret
would go into syndication.

12:02.521 --> 12:05.222
Sabrina! Wake up!

12:05.223 --> 12:07.091
Come on, shake a leg!

12:07.092 --> 12:08.593
If I continue
with this shiatsu,

12:08.594 --> 12:10.261
you'll have to pay me.

12:10.262 --> 12:11.996
( grunts )

12:11.997 --> 12:14.165
It's so late!

12:14.166 --> 12:15.566
How come my alarm
didn't go off?

12:15.567 --> 12:17.601
I believe an alarm clock
would go under the umbrella

12:17.602 --> 12:19.670
of modern conveniences.

12:19.671 --> 12:20.838
Oh, so apparently
our forefathers

12:20.839 --> 12:22.139
were late for everything?

12:26.044 --> 12:27.377
( groans )

12:27.378 --> 12:29.280
They've had hairdryers
since the '70s.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.915
They're not modern!

12:30.916 --> 12:32.249
I'm late! I'm late!

12:36.488 --> 12:38.155
I'm beginning to see
a pattern here.

12:38.156 --> 12:40.991
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

12:40.992 --> 12:42.192
Sorry.

12:45.897 --> 12:47.832
Hey, why weren't you
on the bus this morning?

12:47.833 --> 12:49.233
It's a modern convenience.

12:49.234 --> 12:51.202
And I'm against them
and for solar energy.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.204
Everybody with me?

12:53.205 --> 12:56.006
Sabrina, this is
a very complicated equation,

12:56.007 --> 12:58.175
so I'm allowing
the use of calculators.

12:58.176 --> 13:00.077
Oh, great.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.147
( magical whoosh )

13:03.148 --> 13:06.083
It's a good thing
I don't have a pacemaker.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.785
You know, I'm still not
happy with the dress.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.086
The bodice isn't right.

13:09.087 --> 13:10.387
You're telling me.

13:10.388 --> 13:11.688
I look like a house in it.

13:11.689 --> 13:13.891
I need you for one
more fitting. Please?

13:13.892 --> 13:16.026
I can't. I have plans.

13:16.027 --> 13:18.495
And they all involve
me wearing pants.

13:19.097 --> 13:20.764
Hey, Sabrina, after school,

13:20.765 --> 13:22.533
are we still on
for the Slicery and pinball?

13:22.534 --> 13:24.068
I can't. Too modern.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.903
How about a rousing game
of mah-jongg?

13:25.904 --> 13:27.771
What's this new
anti-modern kick you're on?

13:27.772 --> 13:29.039
Oh, if you call
being concerned

13:29.040 --> 13:31.008
about this planet
we call home a "kick."

13:31.009 --> 13:33.944
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to find a buggy heading uptown.

13:33.945 --> 13:35.645
You know, sometimes
I get the feeling

13:35.646 --> 13:37.714
Sabrina doesn't
tell me everything.

13:37.715 --> 13:40.751
Well, since you don't have
anything to do after school...

13:45.924 --> 13:48.559
I need to learn how to say no.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.094
Sabrina, I need
to speak with you.

13:51.629 --> 13:53.764
Uh, I'm still working
on that algebra equation.

13:53.765 --> 13:55.399
Oh, who cares about that?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.634
I was up half the night
working on the second clue

13:57.635 --> 13:58.702
to the family secret game.

13:58.703 --> 13:59.669
Really?

13:59.670 --> 14:01.305
I don't wanna
talk about it.

14:01.306 --> 14:03.407
A real stumper,
but I think I've got it. M--

14:03.408 --> 14:04.642
No. I need to solve it myself!

14:04.643 --> 14:05.742
I don't wanna hear it.

14:05.743 --> 14:07.844
But-- But--

14:07.845 --> 14:10.081
But it's all right here.
Ah! I can't see!

14:10.082 --> 14:13.284
Oh, then I guess
you don't want to know.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.317
Right.

14:14.318 --> 14:17.121
I don't wanna know.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.990
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

14:24.662 --> 14:26.931
( booming voice ):
<i>No shortcuts!</i>

14:27.999 --> 14:29.233
Oh, this can't be good.

14:30.334 --> 14:33.104
Apparently,
I'm on the lone prairie.

14:33.105 --> 14:34.338
Maybe it's not so lone.

14:34.339 --> 14:36.073
Mrs. Quick?

14:36.074 --> 14:38.209
Oh, no, I guess
she was an accomplice.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.343
Sabrina,

14:39.344 --> 14:40.877
what are you doing here?

14:40.878 --> 14:43.581
Aren't you wondering
what you're doing here?

14:43.582 --> 14:46.450
I'm dreaming.
This is one of my favorites.

14:46.451 --> 14:48.819
Michael Landon should
be along any minute.

14:50.589 --> 14:51.956
I'm here at election
headquarters

14:51.957 --> 14:53.691
where a very heated
debate has erupted

14:53.692 --> 14:55.025
over mental floss.

14:55.026 --> 14:57.828
Now, arguing in favor
of flossing is Hilda Spellman.

14:57.829 --> 14:59.597
Hilda Spellman has gone
on record as saying,

14:59.598 --> 15:01.064
"A vote against mental floss

15:01.065 --> 15:03.367
would be a vote
against family values."

15:03.368 --> 15:05.503
Interestingly enough,
arguing for the opposition

15:05.504 --> 15:07.738
is her sister,
Zelda Spellman.

15:07.739 --> 15:09.006
Now, Zelda--
Uncle Roy!

15:09.007 --> 15:10.541
Uncle Roy, please,
could we have a word?

15:10.542 --> 15:12.076
What is your take
on all of this?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.744
This mental floss debate

15:13.745 --> 15:16.046
has turned into
a smear campaign.

15:16.047 --> 15:19.183
I've never seen so much
mudslinging in my life.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.785
ZELDA:
Hilda, using mental floss

15:20.786 --> 15:21.919
is a crime against nature!

15:21.920 --> 15:23.720
HILDA:
Get your knee out of my spine!

15:23.721 --> 15:24.889
Ow!

15:25.390 --> 15:26.457
( gasps )

15:26.458 --> 15:27.491
Oh, good. You're up.

15:27.492 --> 15:29.160
What's the quickest
way out of here?

15:29.161 --> 15:30.928
If you're looking
for a shortcut,

15:30.929 --> 15:32.462
I don't know any.

15:32.463 --> 15:35.032
Oh, no shortcuts.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.933
So I've been sent
to the prairie

15:36.934 --> 15:38.935
because back then,
shortcuts didn't exist.

15:38.936 --> 15:40.404
Are you here
to explain things?

15:40.405 --> 15:42.539
Well, I am a guide.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.541
Have you got anything to eat?

15:44.542 --> 15:45.909
Oh, you want something to eat.

15:45.910 --> 15:48.245
I get it. So I'm supposed to
make something from scratch

15:48.246 --> 15:50.614
without using shortcuts and then
my punishment will be over.

15:50.615 --> 15:51.982
I'll be zapped back, right?

15:51.983 --> 15:53.350
I'm a little deaf,

15:53.351 --> 15:55.419
so let's go with yes.

15:56.688 --> 15:57.754
You know,
these dirt floors

15:57.755 --> 16:00.591
are really hard to get clean.
Mrs. Quick?

16:00.592 --> 16:02.626
I am gonna make bread
and butter from scratch.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.195
Oh, that's not how my dream
usually goes,

16:04.196 --> 16:06.530
but...okay.

16:06.531 --> 16:08.465
( <i>upbeat country theme playing</i> )

17:07.025 --> 17:09.827
Okay, I made
homemade bread and butter

17:09.828 --> 17:11.494
with no shortcuts.

17:11.496 --> 17:13.296
We're about to be
sent back home.

17:13.297 --> 17:15.833
This is my dream and
I'm not ready to go home.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.335
You know, Sabrina,
you're kind of bossy.

17:18.336 --> 17:21.305
This bread's got dirt on it.
Just eat it.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.641
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

17:24.876 --> 17:27.377
Well?
Thank you.

17:29.146 --> 17:31.114
That-- That should have worked!

17:31.115 --> 17:32.149
( crackle )

17:32.150 --> 17:33.183
Oh!

17:33.184 --> 17:35.686
Stupid embers.

17:35.687 --> 17:38.322
Hey, that clue wasn't fire.

17:38.323 --> 17:39.856
It was ember.

17:39.857 --> 17:41.292
M plus ember

17:41.293 --> 17:42.759
equals member.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.628
That's really good, Sabrina.

17:44.629 --> 17:47.297
That makes much more sense
than what I had.

17:47.298 --> 17:48.665
"M'fire."

17:48.666 --> 17:50.334
Okay,

17:50.335 --> 17:52.269
I figured it out by myself.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.670
We're ready to go.

17:55.206 --> 17:57.107
Big nothing.

17:57.108 --> 17:58.675
Valerie?

17:58.676 --> 18:01.578
I've never dreamed
about two students before.

18:01.579 --> 18:04.247
Sabrina, you decided
to help out after all.

18:04.248 --> 18:06.583
Is this a cool place
for our church play?

18:06.584 --> 18:08.085
"Prayer-ee Days?"

18:08.086 --> 18:09.853
Is Michael Landon with you?

18:09.854 --> 18:11.488
This authentic
log cabin

18:11.489 --> 18:15.125
is Westbridge's only
historical monument.

18:15.126 --> 18:16.526
Unless you count me.

18:16.527 --> 18:17.995
He's a tour guide?

18:17.996 --> 18:19.563
I've been in Westbridge
this whole time?

18:19.564 --> 18:21.298
I could've just walked home.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.035
What do you and Mrs. Quick
talk about?

18:27.339 --> 18:30.140
Okay, why is my boyfriend
wearing a bonnet?

18:30.141 --> 18:31.575
He's filling in
for Mrs. Bogle,

18:31.576 --> 18:32.542
the pastor's wife.

18:32.543 --> 18:33.843
Of all days
for her to have

18:33.844 --> 18:35.879
an allergic reaction
to corn.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.815
I've never dreamed
about three students before.

18:38.816 --> 18:41.051
I'm beginning to feel
my life is empty.

18:41.052 --> 18:42.987
Uh, Mrs. Quick,
come with me.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.756
<i>This teacher's blue</i>
<i>and needs a lift</i>

18:45.757 --> 18:47.224
<i>For all her trouble</i>
<i>here's a gift</i>

18:50.394 --> 18:52.596
What a wonderful dream.

18:52.597 --> 18:54.832
Alone with Harrison Ford,

18:54.833 --> 18:57.467
dancing in the gardens
of Versailles.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.071
Go back to sleep.

19:01.072 --> 19:03.573
Go back to sleep.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.145
I'm tired
and I'm filthy.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.580
We know the feeling.

19:09.581 --> 19:10.714
Where have you guys been?

19:10.715 --> 19:11.881
The campaign trail.

19:11.882 --> 19:13.951
Oh, sure, we indulged
in a little mudslinging,

19:13.952 --> 19:15.485
but the tips were great.

19:16.587 --> 19:18.489
So how was life
on the prairie?

19:18.490 --> 19:19.990
You knew about that?

19:19.991 --> 19:21.291
We had to sign the release form.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.327
Lucky for you,
the Witches' Council was so busy

19:23.328 --> 19:25.028
with the election,
they didn't have time

19:25.029 --> 19:26.363
to send you back
to the real prairie.

19:26.364 --> 19:28.598
Oh, so you're trying
to sugarcoat the fact

19:28.599 --> 19:30.734
that they took a <i>shortcut?!</i>

19:30.735 --> 19:31.802
Oh! That reminds me.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.636
I need to floss
before I go vote.

19:33.637 --> 19:35.371
Not to mention,
shower.

19:35.372 --> 19:36.173
Me first!

19:37.208 --> 19:38.442
I've touched parts of animals

19:38.443 --> 19:40.777
you wouldn't put in sausage.

19:40.778 --> 19:42.079
( cries out )

19:42.080 --> 19:44.381
I can't remember anything
about the issues.

19:44.382 --> 19:45.983
Well, we've been standing
in line so long,

19:45.984 --> 19:47.818
your mental floss has
probably worn off.

19:47.819 --> 19:48.852
I, on the other hand,

19:48.853 --> 19:50.753
couldn't be more
ready to vote.

19:50.754 --> 19:51.855
Well, then I'll
just re-floss.

19:51.856 --> 19:53.990
It's still legal, you know.

19:55.726 --> 19:57.528
( rubbery squeaking )

19:59.331 --> 20:01.565
Now, I'm an informed voter
once again.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.104
Oh! Democracy blows!

20:09.840 --> 20:10.941
So far I've got:

20:10.942 --> 20:13.543
"Every member
of the Spellman..."

20:13.544 --> 20:15.345
I'm getting there.

20:15.346 --> 20:17.347
What's the rush?
I didn't get to vote, anyway.

20:17.348 --> 20:19.583
Hey, the election
results are on.

20:20.818 --> 20:22.786
I wonder if mental floss
got voted out?

20:22.787 --> 20:24.321
ANNOUNCER ( over TV ):
<i>...Terseck, 244.</i>

20:24.322 --> 20:25.723
Oh, that stinks!

20:25.724 --> 20:27.390
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And this just in:</i>

20:27.391 --> 20:29.926
<i>the "Tell A Mortal Boyfriend"</i>
<i>proposition has failed.</i>

20:29.927 --> 20:31.127
Thank you very much.

20:31.128 --> 20:32.763
Now Harvey's gonna
continue thinking

20:32.764 --> 20:34.431
he's losing his mind
forever.

20:34.432 --> 20:35.633
Let's not beat ourselves up.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.400
I'm sure our votes
wouldn't have mattered.

20:37.401 --> 20:38.702
<i>What a close race.</i>

20:38.703 --> 20:41.104
<i>One vote in favor would have</i>
<i>called for a runoff.</i>

20:41.105 --> 20:42.439
<i>Two votes would've won it.</i>

20:42.440 --> 20:43.740
HILDA:
I don't know what's worse:

20:43.741 --> 20:46.010
that we lost,
or that Zelda gets to gloat.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.544
That Aunt Zelda
gets to gloat.

20:47.545 --> 20:49.146
Oh, I'm not gloating.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.748
There are some propositions
that passed

20:50.749 --> 20:52.682
that I'm very unhappy about.

20:52.683 --> 20:54.684
Did you hear the good news?
What?

20:54.685 --> 20:56.920
Thank God it's Fridyah!

20:56.921 --> 20:58.722
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

21:01.392 --> 21:04.128
Oh, I've forgotten
how much I love this book.

21:05.663 --> 21:06.896
Oh, no!

21:06.897 --> 21:09.099
This chapter's missing.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.267
( huffs )

21:11.102 --> 21:13.670
I'm going to the library.

21:13.671 --> 21:15.005
Oh, what the heck.

21:16.975 --> 21:17.841
Heathcliff!

21:18.676 --> 21:20.477
Heathcliff!

21:20.478 --> 21:22.146
Looking for a chapter?

21:22.147 --> 21:23.647
Taking a shortcut?

21:23.648 --> 21:25.382
It was a mistake.

21:25.383 --> 21:28.585
I'm on the moors because
I was looking for Roger Moore.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.721
Dudley Moore?

21:31.722 --> 21:33.790
Oh, all right,
I took a shortcut.

21:33.791 --> 21:36.960
You told me we were
going for ice cream.
