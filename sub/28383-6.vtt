<font color="#11FF11">So, Britain's Got Talent series 13.</font>

00:15.140 --> 00:17.031
<font color="#FFFF00">Series 13.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Unlucky for some.</font>

00:17.033 --> 00:20.832
<font color="#11FF11">Ha! What a load</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of superstitious nonsense.</font>

00:20.833 --> 00:23.833
# There may be trouble ahead...

00:27.833 --> 00:29.832
<font color="#FFFF00">Bloody fantastic.</font>

00:29.833 --> 00:31.832
THEY SCREAM

00:31.833 --> 00:32.872
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my goodness!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow!</font>

00:32.873 --> 00:35.513
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, good Lord!</font>

00:38.833 --> 00:39.833
<font color="#11FF11">This is what I think!</font>

00:39.834 --> 00:41.833
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you!</font>

00:45.873 --> 00:49.832
<font color="#FFFF00">There's nothing superstitious</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about good old series 13.</font>

00:49.833 --> 00:52.832
<font color="#11FF11">And some of this year's acts</font>
<font color="#11FF11">will prove just that.</font>

00:52.833 --> 00:59.832
# There'll be moonlight and music
And love and romance... #

00:59.833 --> 01:01.672
<font color="#FFFF00">Absolutely incredible.</font>

01:01.673 --> 01:03.672
<font color="#00FFFF">Beautifully done.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Seriously scary.</font>

01:03.673 --> 01:05.833
<font color="#FFFF00">That was unbelievable.</font>

01:07.833 --> 01:09.833
<font color="#11FF11">I, for one, couldn't be more excited</font>
<font color="#11FF11">about series 13.</font>

01:17.833 --> 01:21.833
<font color="#11FF11">What is going on?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, it's season 13, guys.</font>

01:23.833 --> 01:25.832
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Is there anybody there?</font>

01:25.833 --> 01:27.832
<font color="#11FF11">Hello?</font>

01:27.833 --> 01:28.833
Hello.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.192
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Hello.</font>

01:30.193 --> 01:31.832
Hello.
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi.</font>

01:31.833 --> 01:34.832
<font color="#11FF11">What's your name?</font>
Russell T Bird.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.832
<font color="#11FF11">How old are you, Russell?</font>

01:36.833 --> 01:38.032
Reverse 17.

01:38.033 --> 01:40.832
<font color="#11FF11">71.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">71.</font>

01:40.833 --> 01:41.833
<font color="#FFFF00">He's 71, man.</font>

01:41.834 --> 01:43.833
<font color="#11FF11">You look early 20s.</font>

01:44.833 --> 01:45.833
I love you.

01:45.834 --> 01:49.032
<font color="#11FF11">Do you have a day job</font>
<font color="#11FF11">or are you a retired gentleman?</font>

01:49.033 --> 01:51.832
I'm sort of retired, as such.
<font color="#11FF11">What were you doing before?</font>

01:51.833 --> 01:53.832
Doing a bit of distributing
and stuff like that.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.352
<font color="#11FF11">What were you distributing?</font>
Magazines.

01:56.353 --> 01:59.832
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, right.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">So, why Britain's Got Talent now?</font>

01:59.833 --> 02:02.832
Because I've always wanted
to be on it.

02:02.833 --> 02:06.032
And it'll be like a little reward
for all my efforts

02:06.033 --> 02:08.032
since I was a teenager.

02:08.032 --> 02:11.832
<font color="#11FF11">OK.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Russell, we're all rooting for you.</font>

02:11.833 --> 02:13.833
<font color="#11FF11">The stage is yours, sir.</font>
Thank you.

<font color="#11FF11">Good luck, my friend.</font>
Do I do it again?

04:16.833 --> 04:18.832
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, do it again.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Good luck.</font>

04:18.833 --> 04:19.833
<font color="#FFFF00">Here we go, come on!</font>

04:21.833 --> 04:23.832

# Together in electric dreams

# Oh-oh

05:04.833 --> 05:06.832
# We'll always be together

05:06.833 --> 05:11.832
# However far it is. #

DISTORTED BUZZING

05:34.833 --> 05:36.352
<font color="#11FF11">The weird thing was,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">after all that,</font>

05:36.353 --> 05:37.832
<font color="#11FF11">you didn't really play it that much.</font>

05:37.833 --> 05:39.832
<font color="#11FF11">Like, a few notes.</font>

05:39.833 --> 05:41.193
<font color="#11FF11">I couldn't believe it.</font>

05:43.673 --> 05:46.832
<font color="#11FF11">Well, look, it was</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a wonderfully exuberant performance.</font>

05:46.833 --> 05:48.832
<font color="#11FF11">I loved it.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It was joyous.</font>

05:48.833 --> 05:49.833
Thank you.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.832
<font color="#00FFFF">It didn't matter that you couldn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">play, didn't play, whatever.</font>

05:54.833 --> 05:57.832
<font color="#00FFFF">I really enjoyed it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It was good fun.</font>

05:57.833 --> 06:00.832
<font color="#00FFFF">And you know what,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I actually really like your voice.</font>

06:00.833 --> 06:02.832
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

06:02.833 --> 06:06.832
<font color="#00FFFF">I actually think that it was better</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">when it didn't work, that.</font>

06:06.833 --> 06:08.512
Oh, right.

06:08.513 --> 06:10.832
<font color="#00FFFF">But you still threw</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">some amazing shapes, Russell.</font>

06:10.833 --> 06:12.833
Amanda, thank you.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.832
<font color="#FFFF00">I actually quite liked your voice.</font>

06:16.833 --> 06:18.832
<font color="#FFFF00">It was like, you know,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the guy in Back To The Future.</font>

06:18.833 --> 06:21.672
<font color="#FFFF00">You know, the sort of nutty</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">professor. </font>All the time, Simon.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.872
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I get that.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I like it.</font>

06:22.873 --> 06:25.832
<font color="#11FF11">I got to go back and fix my guitar.</font>

06:25.833 --> 06:26.833
<font color="#00FFFF">Great Scott!</font>

06:26.834 --> 06:28.832
<font color="#FFFF00">You're nuts.</font>

06:28.833 --> 06:30.832
<font color="#FFFF00">But you are fantastically nuts,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by the way.</font>

06:30.833 --> 06:33.872
<font color="#FFFF00">And like a true professional,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you just carried on.</font>

06:33.873 --> 06:35.832
I had to for these.

06:35.833 --> 06:37.832
CHEERING

06:37.833 --> 06:38.833
Thank you.

06:39.873 --> 06:42.833
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I'd like to kick it off</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with a yes.</font>

06:43.833 --> 06:46.352
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>
Thank you.

06:46.353 --> 06:47.833
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes from me, Russell.</font>

06:48.833 --> 06:51.833
<font color="#11FF11">Russell, you just got four yeses!</font>

07:04.513 --> 07:06.872
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know what, you carried on,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the show must go on.</font>

07:06.873 --> 07:09.832
<font color="#FFFF00">What a pro.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What a professional.</font>

07:09.833 --> 07:12.832
<font color="#00FFFF">I love the fact he kept performing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">while they tried to fix it.</font>

07:12.833 --> 07:14.192
<font color="#FFFF00">I know.</font>

07:14.193 --> 07:17.833
<font color="#00FFFF">Have you got your lucky socks on?</font>
My lucky socks? Yes, I do.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.832
<font color="#11FF11">Remember that time</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he electrocuted himself</font>

07:21.833 --> 07:23.833
<font color="#11FF11">while he was just hammering</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that nail in?</font>

07:25.833 --> 07:28.192
A lot of things could go wrong.
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, God...</font>

07:28.193 --> 07:31.513
It's a dangerous trick, so...
<font color="#00FFFF">It's, like, high-stakes.</font>

07:32.833 --> 07:33.833
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you superstitious?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes.</font>

07:40.673 --> 07:41.832
<font color="#11FF11">Oh...</font>

07:41.833 --> 07:43.192
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh...</font>

07:43.193 --> 07:44.833
<font color="#11FF11">OK.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">OK.</font>

07:47.833 --> 07:49.833
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello.</font>

07:51.353 --> 07:52.833
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello.</font>

07:57.833 --> 07:58.873
<font color="#11FF11">That's pretty scary, isn't it?</font>

08:00.833 --> 08:02.833
We are Brotherhood.

08:03.833 --> 08:06.833
Welcome to our game of mystery...

08:07.833 --> 08:10.353
{\an8}..with this sword.

08:11.673 --> 08:12.832
<font color="#FFFF00">Yep, that's a sharp sword.</font>

08:12.833 --> 08:15.032
The game is simple.

08:15.033 --> 08:19.833
Under one of four boxes
will be this sword.

08:21.833 --> 08:25.833
We will fall on three of them, not
knowing where the sword is hidden.

08:30.833 --> 08:31.833
Dec...

08:31.834 --> 08:33.832
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, ho-ho.</font>

08:33.832 --> 08:35.832
<font color="#FFFF00">See you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Get out there.</font>

08:40.193 --> 08:44.033
Take this sword and place it upright
under one of the boxes.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.832
We cannot see which box you choose.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.833
Our lives are in your hands.

08:55.833 --> 08:58.832
As it's series 13, choose wisely.

08:58.833 --> 09:00.353
<font color="#FFFF00">Good luck.</font>

09:02.833 --> 09:04.833
Simon...

09:05.833 --> 09:09.833
You will decide
which boxes we fall onto.

09:14.833 --> 09:15.833
Dec...

09:17.673 --> 09:21.833
This blindfold will prevent you
from seeing which boxes Simon picks.

09:23.833 --> 09:30.832
Simon, these four envelopes contain
numbers that correspond to each box.

09:30.833 --> 09:34.832
You will pick different boxes
for each of us to fall onto.

09:34.833 --> 09:38.352
As one of the boxes
contains the sword,

09:38.353 --> 09:41.873
your choice will determine our fate.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.832
Brother, stand above your box.

09:46.833 --> 09:47.833
<font color="#FFFF00">He's saying that number.</font>

09:54.833 --> 09:57.833
Brother, stand above your box.

10:03.833 --> 10:07.193
Simon, you have now chosen our fate.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.832
<font color="#FFFF00">It's best you don't watch this.</font>

10:15.833 --> 10:18.833
<font color="#FFFF00">And you put a sword there, yeah?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yes.</font>

10:20.033 --> 10:21.833
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, don't try this at home.</font>

10:24.833 --> 10:26.833
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, God...</font>

10:43.033 --> 10:44.833
<font color="#11FF11">Urgh...!</font>

10:56.833 --> 10:58.833
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, he's jumped on box four.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">God, I nearly died.</font>

11:11.833 --> 11:13.353
<font color="#FFFF00">The last one's jumping, Dec.</font>

11:18.833 --> 11:20.033
AUDIENCE GROANS

11:40.833 --> 11:43.832
<font color="#FFFF00">Is that where you put the sword?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yes.</font>

11:43.833 --> 11:44.833
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow.</font>

11:47.833 --> 11:49.672
<font color="#00FFFF">Brilliant.</font>

11:49.673 --> 11:50.832
<font color="#00FFFF">Simon...</font>

11:50.833 --> 11:54.832
<font color="#FFFF00">Next time, how about we have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">two boxes and David does it?</font>

11:54.833 --> 11:55.833
<font color="#FFFF00">And I'll choose.</font>

11:55.834 --> 11:59.832
<font color="#00FFFF">As a dangerous kind of concept</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and everything else,</font>

11:59.833 --> 12:02.833
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought it was a really</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thrilling act. So, well done.</font>

12:03.833 --> 12:05.832
<font color="#11FF11">It was great.</font>

12:05.833 --> 12:08.352
<font color="#11FF11">We're always saying</font>
<font color="#11FF11">we like to see danger on this show.</font>

12:08.353 --> 12:12.193
<font color="#11FF11">I love the presentation,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">seriously scary. Well done, guys.</font>

12:13.833 --> 12:16.192
<font color="#00FFFF">It was very different.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know how you did it.</font>

12:16.193 --> 12:18.832
<font color="#00FFFF">And I'd like to see more. So, I'm</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">going to kick this off with a yes.</font>

12:18.833 --> 12:20.832
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a yes from me.</font>

12:20.833 --> 12:21.833
<font color="#11FF11">I'm going to say yes.</font>

12:22.833 --> 12:24.833
<font color="#FFFF00">Four yeses.</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you very much.</font>

12:33.833 --> 12:35.833

<font color="#FFFF00">Well done.</font>

12:52.490 --> 12:55.489
Good evening, Manchester!

12:55.490 --> 12:57.489
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you think you can win?</font>

12:57.490 --> 12:58.490
Absolutely.

12:58.490 --> 12:59.490

<font color="#FFFF00">Think?</font>

13:15.330 --> 13:17.490
<font color="#00FFFF">Welcome to Britain's Got Talent.</font>
Thank you.

13:18.490 --> 13:21.490
<font color="#11FF11">We are all rooting for you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">So, take it away.</font>

13:26.490 --> 13:27.530
Let's hope it goes OK.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.490
Big day for us to day.

13:34.490 --> 13:35.529
BUZZER

13:35.530 --> 13:37.489
<font color="#FFFF00">We've had a lot of acts like this</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on before.</font>

13:37.490 --> 13:39.490
<font color="#FFFF00">So, I would have loved it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to have been a surprise.</font>

13:41.330 --> 13:43.490
Is this it?
<font color="#00FFFF">The judges are ready for you.</font>

13:51.690 --> 13:54.490
BUZZER

13:56.490 --> 13:58.489

<font color="#00FFFF">I just wasn't overly enjoying it.</font>

14:02.490 --> 14:04.490
So nervous.
<font color="#00FFFF">Good.</font>

14:06.490 --> 14:08.529
It's the first audition for us.

14:08.530 --> 14:12.850
For this, we come to the best
Got Talent in the world.

14:16.490 --> 14:19.489
Our performance today
is very dangerous.

14:19.490 --> 14:22.489
Today, I could really hurt
the woman I love.

14:22.490 --> 14:24.489
<font color="#FFFF00">It's over to you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Good luck.</font>

Thank you.

14:27.010 --> 14:30.489
I want to win with my girlfriend.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.489
When we win, we are married.

14:32.490 --> 14:35.330
<font color="#00FFFF">Argh!</font>
I swear.

14:38.490 --> 14:39.530

14:52.490 --> 14:54.489
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, you have 23 years.</font>

14:54.490 --> 14:56.489

Yes.
I know her four years.

15:12.330 --> 15:15.489
<font color="#FFFF00">And are you married?</font>
No, not yet.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.489
AUDIENCE: <font color="#11FF11">Aw...!</font>

15:17.490 --> 15:22.489
<font color="#FFFF00">Why Britain's Got Talent,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not America's Got Talent?</font>

15:22.490 --> 15:27.489
For us, the British Got Talent
is the best TV show in the world.

16:36.170 --> 16:40.489
# All the shine
Of a thousand spotlights

LAUGHTER

19:03.490 --> 19:06.009
<font color="#11FF11">We have seen</font>
<font color="#11FF11">some other acrobatic acts,</font>

19:06.010 --> 19:10.489
<font color="#11FF11">but we haven't seen them in such</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a beautiful, romantic setting</font>

19:10.490 --> 19:12.489
<font color="#11FF11">as the one you just did.</font>

19:12.490 --> 19:16.489
<font color="#11FF11">And there's a beautiful connection</font>

19:16.490 --> 19:21.490
<font color="#11FF11">And it was really just so romantic,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">so gorgeous from start to finish.</font>

19:24.530 --> 19:27.489
<font color="#00FFFF">I have to say,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you make it look easy.</font>

19:27.490 --> 19:30.489
<font color="#00FFFF">And I know it's probably one</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of the most difficult things to do.</font>

19:30.490 --> 19:32.489
<font color="#00FFFF">Your strength is unreal.</font>

19:32.490 --> 19:34.489
<font color="#00FFFF">And you were so graceful</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and beautiful.</font>

19:34.490 --> 19:36.489
<font color="#00FFFF">I loved the story.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It was heartbreaking.</font>

19:36.490 --> 19:39.490
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought you did a great job.</font>

19:41.490 --> 19:43.489

<font color="#FFFF00">Great chemistry.</font>

19:43.490 --> 19:46.489
<font color="#FFFF00">Fantastic song, of course.</font>

19:46.490 --> 19:48.170

<font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>

20:47.010 --> 20:49.490
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll show you some highlights</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from previous series.</font>

20:50.817 --> 20:53.817
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God, memory lane, man.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">One of my favourite moments.</font>

20:57.817 --> 21:00.816
<font color="#FFFF00">You know, that is my legacy.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Remember that?</font>

21:00.817 --> 21:01.817
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I remember that.</font>

21:04.817 --> 21:06.657
<font color="#FFFF00">It was amazing.</font>

21:07.817 --> 21:09.816
<font color="#FFFF00">We look happy.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">We are happy.</font>

21:09.817 --> 21:12.817
Seriously, I literally feel like
I've watched this on TV.

21:14.657 --> 21:16.816
<font color="#FFFF00">Come on, guys,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">let's make some memories.</font>

21:16.817 --> 21:18.817
<font color="#11FF11">Let's make some dreams come true.</font>

21:21.177 --> 21:23.656
<font color="#FFFF00">Good luck. Straight on.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's all yours.</font>

21:23.657 --> 21:24.816
<font color="#FFFF00">Enjoy it.</font>

21:24.817 --> 21:26.817
<font color="#FFFF00">Good luck.</font>

21:35.817 --> 21:38.496
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello, girls.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Where are you from?</font>

21:38.497 --> 21:42.503
We are a dance company
called Khronos Girls.

21:42.505 --> 21:43.824
And we are from Croydon.

21:43.825 --> 21:45.824
And we're just here
to share a message

21:45.825 --> 21:47.825
and hopefully you guys enjoy.

21:49.825 --> 21:51.025
Khronos Girls!

21:52.825 --> 21:56.824
We're an all-female dance company
and we're 15 to 18.

21:56.825 --> 21:58.345
Khronos means power.

21:59.825 --> 22:02.825
<font color="#00FFFF">Our message is so important.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Girls can do anything.</font>

22:05.825 --> 22:08.824
To perform for the Royal family,
that's the top, top, top.

22:08.825 --> 22:10.824
Could you just imagine going,
"One and two and three"

22:10.825 --> 22:14.825
in front of the Queen?
<font color="#00FFFF">Stop scaring me.</font>

22:15.825 --> 22:18.824
For us to be the very first
all-female dance company to win,

22:18.825 --> 22:21.825
it'd just be a dream come true.
Honestly.

22:24.825 --> 22:27.024
Our piece is based on
the suffragettes.

22:27.025 --> 22:28.824
And with everything
that's going on now,

22:28.825 --> 22:31.864
we really want to use our voice
to tell the people of our generation

22:31.865 --> 22:33.824
to get up and vote.

22:33.825 --> 22:35.504
And especially, women,
you have a voice

22:35.505 --> 22:37.824
and anything that happens
will directly affect us.

22:37.825 --> 22:39.824
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:39.825 --> 22:40.825

23:42.825 --> 23:45.825
THEY ALL SHOUT

23:48.825 --> 23:50.824
It's your vote that matters!

23:50.825 --> 23:52.825
<font color="#00FFFF">Go on, girl.</font>

23:56.825 --> 23:58.825
<font color="#00FFFF">I've got major goose bumps.</font>

24:22.825 --> 24:25.825

24:53.825 --> 24:55.824
<font color="#00FFFF">Absolutely extraordinary.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">Great message. Great energy.</font>

24:57.825 --> 25:00.184
<font color="#00FFFF">You danced for your lives.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Well done.</font>

25:00.185 --> 25:03.825
<font color="#11FF11">Khronos Girls,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you came to set the place on fire.</font>

25:04.825 --> 25:08.824
<font color="#11FF11">Yes, I felt that passion.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You know, we were there with you.</font>

25:08.825 --> 25:11.824
<font color="#11FF11">What an incredible message,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">girl power!</font>

25:11.825 --> 25:12.825
<font color="#11FF11">Yes!</font>

25:15.865 --> 25:18.824
<font color="#FFFF00">I felt like I was watching</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a show in the West End.</font>

25:18.825 --> 25:21.824
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it's my favourite dance act</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we've seen throughout the series.</font>

25:21.825 --> 25:23.824
<font color="#FFFF00">I really do.</font>

25:23.825 --> 25:25.824
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, it was immaculate.</font>

25:25.825 --> 25:27.025
<font color="#FFFF00">Really good.</font>

25:28.825 --> 25:31.824
<font color="#11FF11">This is an incredibly easy yes.</font>

25:31.825 --> 25:34.824
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, for girl power!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Whooo!</font>

25:34.825 --> 25:37.824
<font color="#FFFF00">We've got three yeses from me.</font>

25:37.825 --> 25:39.864
<font color="#00FFFF">Four yeses from a girl.</font>

25:39.865 --> 25:42.824
<font color="#00FFFF">Through to the next round!</font>

25:42.825 --> 25:43.825
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

25:52.825 --> 25:53.825

<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know what it is,</font>

26:02.825 --> 26:05.824
<font color="#00FFFF">but this year feels like there's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a lot more old-school stuff. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

26:05.825 --> 26:06.825
<font color="#FFFF00">I love all that stuff.</font>

26:06.826 --> 26:09.344
<font color="#11FF11">They're ready for you,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">if you're ready. </font>Is that right?

26:09.345 --> 26:11.824
Shall I go?
<font color="#11FF11">Yes. Let's do it. It is all yours.</font>

26:11.825 --> 26:14.825

<font color="#11FF11">We actually know each other.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Welcome to Britain's Got Talent.</font>

26:36.825 --> 26:38.824
<font color="#11FF11">For those of us</font>
<font color="#11FF11">who haven't already met you,</font>

26:38.825 --> 26:42.024
<font color="#11FF11">can you introduce yourself?</font>
My name is Colin Thackery.

26:42.025 --> 26:43.824
I'm 88.

26:43.825 --> 26:47.824
And as you can see,
I'm a Chelsea Pensioner.

26:47.825 --> 26:49.825
APPLAUSE

26:51.665 --> 26:54.824
My name's Colin Thackery

26:54.825 --> 26:56.824
and I live at
the Royal Hospital at Chelsea,

26:56.825 --> 26:58.824
hence my uniform.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.824
It's a happy place
to spend one's retirement.

27:01.825 --> 27:04.824
I've been singing for 80 years
in various ways,

27:04.825 --> 27:06.824
when I was in rank in the Army.

27:06.825 --> 27:09.344
And it was good fun.
Good fun.

27:09.345 --> 27:13.824
The song I'm singing this afternoon
is called The Wind Beneath My Wings.

27:13.825 --> 27:17.825
It's in tribute to a really lovely
lady who I love very much.

27:20.980 --> 27:25.140
My wife and I were married in 1950
for 66 years.

27:26.460 --> 27:29.460
I never got any promotion
in the Army before I met her.

27:30.460 --> 27:36.300
So anywhere I got was entirely due
to her gentle support all the time.

27:38.460 --> 27:41.459
Joan died in December 2016.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.460
And she died in my arms.

27:45.460 --> 27:49.459
She was sitting in her chair
and she suddenly said, "Colin..."

27:49.460 --> 27:52.459
Instantaneously,
I knew she was dying.

27:52.460 --> 27:54.460
And she died in my arms.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.459
I miss her like mad.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.820
I talk to her all the time.
Tell her what's happening.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.459
If she knew I was on this stage,

28:05.460 --> 28:08.459
I think she'd be rather chuffed,
really.

28:08.460 --> 28:11.459
And I should be very proud
to sing to her,

28:11.460 --> 28:15.460
because she was, truly,
the wind beneath my wings.

28:19.460 --> 28:22.459
I'm going to sing you a song
that is dedicated, actually,

28:22.460 --> 28:24.139
to my late wife.

28:24.140 --> 28:25.459
AUDIENCE: <font color="#FFFF00">Aw...!</font>

28:25.460 --> 28:26.460
Erm...

28:27.460 --> 28:31.459
<font color="#11FF11">Colin, I think it's extraordinary</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you've come here.</font>

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
<font color="#11FF11">The stage is yours.</font>

28:32.461 --> 28:34.460
Thank you very much.

28:48.460 --> 28:54.460
{\an8}# It must have been cold there
In my shadow

29:00.460 --> 29:05.460
# To never see sunlight on your face

29:08.820 --> 29:13.460
# You did your best to make me shine

29:17.460 --> 29:21.460
# You always walked a step behind

29:26.460 --> 29:32.500
# I was the one with all the glory

29:35.820 --> 29:41.460
# While you were the one
With all the strength

29:44.460 --> 29:49.140
# A beautiful face without a name

29:52.460 --> 29:57.460
# I never once heard you complain

30:01.460 --> 30:06.460
# Did you ever know that
You're my hero

30:08.980 --> 30:15.460
# And everything
That I'd like to be?

30:18.460 --> 30:23.460
# I could fly higher than an eagle

30:26.140 --> 30:31.460
# Cos you are the wind
Beneath my wings

30:38.820 --> 30:43.460
# It might have appeared
To go unnoticed

30:48.460 --> 30:52.500
# But I have it all here
In my heart

30:56.500 --> 31:01.460
# I want you to know
I know the truth

31:05.460 --> 31:11.460
# I would be nothing without you

31:12.460 --> 31:18.460
# Did you ever know that
You're my hero

31:21.460 --> 31:27.460
# And everything
That I'd like to be?

31:30.500 --> 31:35.460
# I could fly higher than an eagle

31:38.460 --> 31:46.460
# For you are the wind
Beneath my wings. #

31:52.460 --> 31:58.459
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

31:58.460 --> 32:00.460
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, Colin!</font>

32:16.460 --> 32:18.460
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done, Colin!</font>

32:19.460 --> 32:22.299
<font color="#11FF11">Well, Colin, there is not a dry eye</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in the house.</font>

32:22.300 --> 32:23.460
Thank you.

32:24.660 --> 32:27.459
<font color="#11FF11">It was just the most</font>
<font color="#11FF11">perfect tribute.</font>

32:27.460 --> 32:30.499
<font color="#11FF11">And you sang with such heart</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that it affected all of us deeply.</font>

32:30.500 --> 32:32.459
<font color="#11FF11">It was beautiful.</font>

32:32.460 --> 32:35.460
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

32:38.460 --> 32:41.299
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, Colin,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I really, really loved that.</font>

32:41.300 --> 32:44.819
<font color="#00FFFF">You showed to everyone it's never</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">too late to do the things you love</font>

32:44.820 --> 32:47.460
<font color="#00FFFF">and to sing about the people</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that you love. That was wonderful.</font>

32:52.460 --> 32:56.139
<font color="#11FF11">As I was listening to the words,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I've never thought of it before,</font>

32:56.140 --> 32:58.659
<font color="#11FF11">thinking that all of the men and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">women that fought for their country</font>

32:58.660 --> 33:01.459
<font color="#11FF11">are the wind beneath our wings</font>
<font color="#11FF11">because, if it wasn't for you,</font>

33:01.460 --> 33:02.659
<font color="#11FF11">we wouldn't be here.</font>

33:02.660 --> 33:05.459
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:05.460 --> 33:08.460
<font color="#11FF11">Congratulations.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It was a lovely tribute.</font>

33:11.460 --> 33:14.459
<font color="#FFFF00">You are going to have a moment.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">And it was sincere and it was real</font>

33:14.460 --> 33:17.459
<font color="#FFFF00">and you are what this show</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is all about. So, thank you.</font>

33:17.460 --> 33:19.460
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:23.460 --> 33:26.459
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's start with David.</font>

33:26.460 --> 33:29.459
<font color="#11FF11">I'm going to kick this off</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with a very easy yes.</font>

33:29.460 --> 33:31.459
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes from me, Colin.</font>

33:31.460 --> 33:32.660
<font color="#11FF11">And from me.</font>

33:35.460 --> 33:36.460
<font color="#FFFF00">You've got four yeses.</font>

33:36.461 --> 33:37.820
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:45.460 --> 33:47.459
<font color="#FFFF00">Four yeses.</font>
Yes.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.820
<font color="#11FF11">See you again.</font>
I look forward to that.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.980
<font color="#11FF11">Hello?</font>

34:58.460 --> 35:00.459
<font color="#FFFF00">Is that it?</font>

35:00.460 --> 35:04.459
CLOCK CHIMES

35:04.460 --> 35:06.460
<font color="#00FFFF">Oooh...</font>

35:07.460 --> 35:10.460
<font color="#11FF11">Do you reckon they're people?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No, no. No, they ain't.</font>

35:27.460 --> 35:30.459
{\an8}# I see a little silhouetto
Of a man

35:30.460 --> 35:34.139
# Scaramouch, Scaramouch
Will you do the fandango?

35:34.140 --> 35:37.459
# Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening

35:37.460 --> 35:41.459
# Galileo, Galileo

35:41.460 --> 35:43.459
# Galileo, Figaro, magnifico

35:43.460 --> 35:45.459
<font color="#11FF11">I love them.</font>

35:45.460 --> 35:47.459
# No, no, no, no, no

35:47.460 --> 35:49.459
# Mama mia, mama mia

35:49.460 --> 35:50.979
# Mama mia, let me go

35:50.980 --> 35:55.499
# Beelzebub has a devil
Put aside for me

35:55.500 --> 36:01.460
# For me

36:04.460 --> 36:07.459
# Nothing really matters

36:07.460 --> 36:11.459
# Anyone can see

36:11.460 --> 36:15.459
# Nothing really matters

36:15.460 --> 36:20.460
# Nothing really matters to me. #

36:30.460 --> 36:32.459
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, I like that.</font>

36:32.460 --> 36:35.460
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:42.460 --> 36:45.459
<font color="#00FFFF">What do we do now?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know.</font>

36:45.460 --> 36:48.459
<font color="#FFFF00">David, you've got to talk to them.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh!</font>

36:48.460 --> 36:50.459
<font color="#FFFF00">That's what we do.</font>

36:50.460 --> 36:52.459
<font color="#11FF11">Well, it was extraordinary.</font>

36:52.460 --> 36:54.459
<font color="#11FF11">We always say we want to be</font>
<font color="#11FF11">surprised on this show.</font>

36:54.460 --> 36:58.459
<font color="#11FF11">Well, statues coming to life</font>
<font color="#11FF11">singing Bohemian Rhapsody,</font>

36:58.460 --> 37:00.460
<font color="#11FF11">that counts as being very surprised.</font>

37:03.460 --> 37:06.459
<font color="#FFFF00">The dog thing, I don't know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what that is. It didn't sing.</font>

37:06.460 --> 37:08.459
<font color="#FFFF00">It just raised its paw up.</font>

37:08.460 --> 37:10.139
LAUGHTER

37:10.140 --> 37:13.459
<font color="#FFFF00">That's my only criticism.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Apart from that, I mean...</font>

37:13.460 --> 37:16.459
<font color="#FFFF00">I love seeing things</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've never seen before.</font>

37:16.460 --> 37:20.460
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know who came up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with this idea, but it works.</font>

37:21.460 --> 37:24.459
<font color="#11FF11">I am going to kick this off</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with a yes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes from me.</font>

37:24.460 --> 37:27.459
<font color="#11FF11">It's a yes from me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Four yeses.</font>

37:27.460 --> 37:29.460
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:26.660 --> 38:28.460
<font color="#11FF11">Hello.</font>

38:30.460 --> 38:34.459
<font color="#11FF11">What's your name?</font>
My name is Ben Hart.

38:34.460 --> 38:37.459
<font color="#11FF11">Ben, where are you from?</font>

38:37.460 --> 38:39.140
I'm from London.

38:41.460 --> 38:44.460
My name is Ben Hart,
I'm 28 and I am a magician.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.459
I've been doing magic
since I was a tiny little kid.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.460
In fact,
I can't even remember not doing it.

38:52.820 --> 38:54.459
I perform my own shows,

38:54.460 --> 38:57.459
I've invented magic tricks
for other people.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.459
It's quite rewarding
to watch people being transported

39:00.460 --> 39:03.140
to some sort of magical place
they hadn't considered before.

39:04.460 --> 39:07.299
I wanted to come on
Britain's Got Talent to show my work

39:07.300 --> 39:08.459
to the biggest audience possible.

39:08.460 --> 39:11.460
And who knows, I might even end up
at the Royal Variety Show.

39:12.460 --> 39:16.500
I hope that they will see
that magic can be real.

39:19.460 --> 39:21.459
<font color="#11FF11">We are intrigued</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in what you are going to do.</font>

39:21.460 --> 39:24.459
<font color="#11FF11">You are a man of mystery.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Take it...</font>

39:24.460 --> 39:26.460
<font color="#11FF11">..whatever it is, away.</font>

39:31.460 --> 39:33.459
Now, before the show,
we met some of you

39:33.460 --> 39:37.459
and we asked some of you
to stare into a drinking glass

39:37.460 --> 39:40.659
and then to visualise an object
inside of it.

39:40.660 --> 39:43.459
And once you'd done that,
we asked you to write it down

39:43.460 --> 39:45.459
on a single piece of confetti.

39:45.460 --> 39:46.819
I can see all sorts of things
in here.

39:46.820 --> 39:49.459
Someone's written,
"A glass of water."

39:49.460 --> 39:51.459
"A £50 note."
That sort of thing.

39:51.460 --> 39:54.460
One of these objects
will select itself.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.460
<font color="#00FFFF">I love stuff like this.</font>

40:06.980 --> 40:10.459
Simon, would you read out what's
written on that piece of confetti?

40:10.460 --> 40:12.300
What object is that?

40:13.460 --> 40:15.499
<font color="#FFFF00">It's something I don't like.</font>

40:15.500 --> 40:17.459
OK.
<font color="#FFFF00">An egg.</font>

40:17.460 --> 40:18.460
An egg?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.459
An egg...

40:21.460 --> 40:23.459
It is a reminder
that everything in our life

40:23.460 --> 40:25.299
starts as something smaller.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.499
It is fragile, it is...
It's perfect.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.459
So, all I have to do

40:29.460 --> 40:32.459
is visualise that piece of confetti
getting heavier.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.460
And if you listen,
you may be able to hear it.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.500
And I have to visualise
it changing form.

40:47.460 --> 40:48.460
Growing.

40:48.461 --> 40:49.660
<font color="#00FFFF">What...?</font>

40:58.460 --> 41:01.460
<font color="#00FFFF">That's mental.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">That's so cool.</font>

41:15.460 --> 41:17.460
<font color="#FFFF00">That was amazing.</font>

41:21.460 --> 41:22.460
Thank you all so much.

41:22.461 --> 41:25.459
Now, for this next piece, I will
need somebody from the audience.

41:25.460 --> 41:28.459
I will take this paper aeroplane,
I will throw it into the audience

41:28.460 --> 41:31.459
and one of you will catch it.
Coming out over there.

41:31.460 --> 41:32.820
See, it soars gracefully.

41:34.460 --> 41:37.459
I'm going to get you to unfold
that piece of paper for me,

41:37.460 --> 41:39.819
where you'll find it's not
any old piece of paper.

41:39.820 --> 41:43.459
It's a seating plan
of this very theatre.

41:43.460 --> 41:46.459
Take that piece of paper for me,
hold it behind your back.

41:46.460 --> 41:48.299
Then, I'm going to give you
this pen.

41:48.300 --> 41:51.459
I'm going to make you take this pen
and make a dot or a mark

41:51.460 --> 41:53.459
somewhere on the page
behind your back

41:53.460 --> 41:55.459
so that you don't know where
you're going. Do that for me now.

41:55.460 --> 41:57.459
Just a little dot.
Have you done that?

41:57.460 --> 41:59.459
OK, great.
Will you have a look?

41:59.460 --> 42:01.459
Where did you put your little mark
on the paper?

42:01.460 --> 42:05.460
<font color="#00FFFF">The seat number is L34.</font>
OK, L34.

42:06.980 --> 42:08.459
L34?

42:08.460 --> 42:09.460
Is this 34?

42:10.460 --> 42:12.459
Hello!

42:12.460 --> 42:14.459
What's your name?
<font color="#00FFFF">My name's Annika.</font>

42:14.460 --> 42:17.459
Annika, I think you'll be
absolutely perfect for this.

42:17.460 --> 42:19.819
Are you OK to help me?
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>

42:19.820 --> 42:21.459
OK.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.459
Would everyone here give Annika
a huge round of applause

42:23.460 --> 42:25.460
as she comes on stage?

42:27.460 --> 42:29.459
Quick as you can, Annika.
Follow me.

42:29.460 --> 42:30.820
Watch your step on the way up.

42:33.140 --> 42:35.139
These are two auto-conductive cages.

42:35.140 --> 42:37.459
You can see underneath them,
you can see through them,

42:37.460 --> 42:39.459
you can see above them.
This one's exactly the same.

42:39.460 --> 42:42.459
And they're connected in circuit
to this Tesla coil.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.460
I need you to step up
into this cage.

42:46.460 --> 42:47.979
Nicely done.

42:47.980 --> 42:51.459
Now, Annika, I need you to keep
your hands behind your back.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.660
Are you ready?

42:54.460 --> 42:56.459
Don't worry.

42:56.460 --> 42:59.499
And so, all I have to do
is to complete the circuit.

42:59.500 --> 43:05.500
Five, four, three, two, one.

43:18.460 --> 43:19.500
<font color="#00FFFF">But how...?</font>

43:24.660 --> 43:27.660
Annika, everyone. Thank you so much.
Thank you for helping me.

43:37.460 --> 43:38.499
Thank you, all.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.460
<font color="#00FFFF">Whooo!</font>

43:45.300 --> 43:46.659
<font color="#00FFFF">That's blew my mind a bit.</font>

43:46.660 --> 43:51.459
<font color="#11FF11">Well, you are a man of mystery,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">aren't you?</font>

43:51.460 --> 43:53.459
<font color="#11FF11">Simon, you look very confused.</font>

43:53.460 --> 43:55.459
<font color="#FFFF00">That was unbelievable.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean...</font>

43:55.460 --> 43:59.460
<font color="#FFFF00">..the egg and that and that.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Unbelievable.</font>

44:03.460 --> 44:08.139
<font color="#00FFFF">I love to hate these kinds of acts</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because that's just done my head in.</font>

44:08.140 --> 44:09.459
<font color="#FFFF00">It's magic.</font>

44:09.460 --> 44:12.499
<font color="#00FFFF">It's an exciting feeling</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to see what you're going to do next</font>

44:12.500 --> 44:15.299
<font color="#00FFFF">if we put you through,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because that was amazing.</font>

44:15.300 --> 44:17.140
<font color="#00FFFF">Well done.</font>

44:18.460 --> 44:21.659
<font color="#FFFF00">I kind of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">love this sort of air of mystery</font>

44:21.660 --> 44:24.139
<font color="#FFFF00">and this sort of Victorian vibe</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm getting.</font>

44:24.140 --> 44:26.459
<font color="#FFFF00">You have great showmanship,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">great charm and charisma.</font>

44:26.460 --> 44:29.300
<font color="#FFFF00">You did a great job.</font>
Thank you.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.459
<font color="#11FF11">I'm going to kick this off</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with a yes.</font>

44:33.460 --> 44:34.460
Thank you.

44:35.460 --> 44:37.459
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm saying yes.</font>
Thank you.

44:37.460 --> 44:38.499
<font color="#11FF11">It's a yes from me.</font>

44:38.500 --> 44:42.819
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, if I was going to give you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">one piece of constructive criticism,</font>

44:42.820 --> 44:46.460
<font color="#FFFF00">that would have been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a gorilla in that.</font>

44:48.460 --> 44:51.459
<font color="#FFFF00">But it's for yeses.</font>

44:51.460 --> 44:53.460
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:01.460 --> 45:03.459
<font color="#11FF11">Wow!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done.</font>

45:03.460 --> 45:04.980
<font color="#11FF11">Fantastic.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done.</font>

45:24.037 --> 45:27.236
I'm pretty pumped for this.
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you?</font>

45:27.237 --> 45:31.036
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't believe we're here at</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Britain's Got Talent. It's amazing.</font>

45:31.037 --> 45:33.647
<font color="#11FF11">What would you do</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with quarter of a million pounds?</font>

45:33.648 --> 45:36.897
<font color="#00FFFF">Spend it on filling my whole room</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with chocolate bars.</font>

45:38.897 --> 45:41.416
<font color="#FFFF00">The judges are ready for you.</font>
What, are they actually?

45:41.417 --> 45:43.896
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Come on, follow me. Let's go.</font>

45:43.897 --> 45:46.096
Is this it?
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah.</font>

45:46.097 --> 45:48.897
<font color="#FFFF00">Enjoy, OK?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Good luck, fellas. Enjoy.</font>

45:57.897 --> 45:59.896
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:59.897 --> 46:01.097
<font color="#00FFFF">Aw...!</font>

46:02.897 --> 46:04.896
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello.</font>

46:04.897 --> 46:07.896
Hi.
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, that was a good reaction.</font>

46:07.897 --> 46:10.896
<font color="#FFFF00">You haven't done anything yet.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you? </font>Good, thank you.

46:10.897 --> 46:13.055
<font color="#FFFF00">Just give me your names and ages,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">starting with you, please.</font>

46:13.057 --> 46:14.576
<font color="#11FF11">I'm Jacob, I'm 14 years old.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

46:14.577 --> 46:17.281
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm Noah and I'm 15.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Good.</font>

46:17.283 --> 46:19.282
I'm Tom, I'm 15.
<font color="#FFFF00">Good.</font>

46:19.283 --> 46:20.283
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm Jake and I'm 15.</font>

46:20.284 --> 46:24.642
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, so, I'm guessing you are a band.</font>

46:24.643 --> 46:26.282
Yes.
<font color="#FFFF00">Got it.</font>

46:26.283 --> 46:28.282
<font color="#FFFF00">And what are you called?</font>
Chapter 13.

46:28.283 --> 46:31.282
<font color="#FFFF00">Who put you together?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Or did you put yourselves together?</font>

46:31.283 --> 46:34.282
We were all in School Of Rock,
the musical, together.

46:34.283 --> 46:37.282
<font color="#FFFF00">OK. Whose idea was it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for you to be your own band?</font>

46:37.283 --> 46:39.282
Well, me and Noah shared a room.

46:39.283 --> 46:41.962
And we were always
just sort of imagining

46:41.963 --> 46:44.282
what it would be like
to be in a band

46:44.283 --> 46:47.282
and then we started talking
to these two and then...

46:47.283 --> 46:49.282
<font color="#FFFF00">Good for you.</font>

46:49.283 --> 46:51.322
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, listen, good luck.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I hope this goes great.</font>

46:51.323 --> 46:53.283
Thank you very much.

47:00.643 --> 47:03.283
<font color="#FFFF00">They look great, don't they?</font>

47:09.283 --> 47:12.282
One, two, three, four.

47:12.283 --> 47:15.283
# Like a fool
I went and stayed too long

47:16.283 --> 47:19.282
# Now I'm wondering
If your love's still strong

47:19.283 --> 47:21.282
# Oooh, baby

47:21.283 --> 47:25.283
# Here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered

47:26.283 --> 47:32.123
# I'm yours

47:40.123 --> 47:42.322
<font color="#00FFFF">I love Stevie Wonder!</font>

47:42.323 --> 47:45.322
# Music is a world within itself

47:45.323 --> 47:50.282
# With a language we all understand

47:50.283 --> 47:54.282
# With an equal opportunity

47:54.283 --> 47:58.282
# For all to sing, dance
And clap their hands

47:58.283 --> 48:02.283
# They can feel it all over

48:03.283 --> 48:07.282
# They can feel it all over, baby

48:07.283 --> 48:10.283
# They can feel it all over

48:11.283 --> 48:14.283
# They can feel it all over

48:31.283 --> 48:32.283
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes!</font>

48:34.283 --> 48:35.283
Make some noise!

48:36.283 --> 48:38.282
<font color="#11FF11">Whaaa...!</font>

48:38.283 --> 48:40.282
# Sneaking out the back door

48:40.283 --> 48:43.282
# To hang out
With those hoodlum friends of mine

48:43.283 --> 48:45.283
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, that's got it going!</font>

48:46.283 --> 48:49.282
# Greeted at the back door

48:49.283 --> 48:51.283
# "I thought I told you
not to go outside"

48:54.963 --> 48:58.283
# Trying your best
To bring some water to your eyes

48:59.283 --> 49:02.282
# Thinking it might stop her
From whipping your behind

49:02.283 --> 49:06.282
# I wish those days
Could come back once more

49:06.283 --> 49:10.282
# Why did those days
Ever have to go?

49:10.283 --> 49:11.482
# I love them so

49:11.483 --> 49:15.322
# Do-do do-do duh de-de-de
De-de-de do

49:15.323 --> 49:17.282
# De-do duh-do

49:17.283 --> 49:20.282
# Well, if you believe in things

49:20.283 --> 49:23.643
# You don't understand
Then you suffer

49:25.283 --> 49:26.483
# Superstition ain't the way

49:41.283 --> 49:42.482
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, that is magnificent!</font>

49:42.483 --> 49:47.283
# Yeah. #

49:52.283 --> 49:55.283
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

50:18.283 --> 50:20.282
<font color="#00FFFF">I honestly can say</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't think I've ever seen</font>

50:20.283 --> 50:23.322
<font color="#00FFFF">four young musicians so together.</font>

50:23.323 --> 50:27.482
<font color="#00FFFF">The drummer, you are amazing.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The guitar playing was spot on.</font>

50:27.483 --> 50:30.282
<font color="#00FFFF">Some of the faces you were pulling</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">were fantastic.</font>

50:30.283 --> 50:31.283
<font color="#00FFFF">You, especially.</font>

50:33.283 --> 50:36.282
<font color="#00FFFF">I just think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you are absolutely incredible.</font>

50:36.283 --> 50:38.283

<font color="#11FF11">It was so refreshing</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that you were so brilliant.</font>

52:07.283 --> 52:10.282
<font color="#11FF11">And also, they were original</font>
<font color="#11FF11">versions of those songs.</font>

52:10.283 --> 52:13.482
<font color="#11FF11">It was faultless, guys.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You came, you conquered.</font>

52:13.483 --> 52:15.283
Thank you.

52:19.283 --> 52:22.282
<font color="#FFFF00">This is so well-deserved</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what you just had.</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">kids watching this show,</font>

LAUGHTER

52:33.283 --> 52:35.282
<font color="#FFFF00">I think what's really exciting is</font>

52:35.283 --> 52:38.282
<font color="#FFFF00">the last time I remember seeing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and hearing something like this</font>

52:38.283 --> 52:40.323
<font color="#FFFF00">was a band called Busted.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That was fantastic.</font>

I love it.

53:31.283 --> 53:32.323

53:33.283 --> 53:35.122
<font color="#11FF11">It's Derek Duvall here.</font>
