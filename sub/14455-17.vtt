WEBVTT

00:12.380 --> 00:15.383
Narrator: Coming up --
why is Q playing matchmaker?

00:15.416 --> 00:17.251
We just took home
three different girls last night

00:17.285 --> 00:19.287
'cause of me.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.055
What's got Sal making headlines?

00:21.089 --> 00:22.690
My friend
just texted me,

00:22.723 --> 00:26.327
"I just saw your balls
on the news."

00:26.360 --> 00:30.631
And why is Q taking it all off
in tonight's punishment?

00:31.799 --> 00:34.602
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.669
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.006
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:40.841 --> 00:43.544
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:43.577 --> 00:45.546
Joe: Larry!

00:49.350 --> 00:50.451
Today,
we're sitting

00:50.484 --> 00:52.120
in a waiting room
at Focus Pointe Global

00:52.153 --> 00:54.488
showing our text messages
to strangers.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.590
Except that the embarrassing
texts that we're getting

00:56.624 --> 00:58.192
have been sent to us
by the other guys.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.128
The goal is to get the stranger
to help you write a reply,

01:00.161 --> 01:01.662
and if they don't,
you lose.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.097
Oh, sorry,
I was texting.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.232
What are we doing?
Of course he was.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.069
Joe: What's with
that sweater?

01:09.103 --> 01:10.271
What's wrong with it?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.606
I got this with you guys,
on tour.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.742
He fell for it.
You shouldn't
listen to us.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.144
Turn the collar up
for a second.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.711
Yeah.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.647
You look like
you're being born.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.283
Oh, here we go.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.585
Fire up them
texting fingers, buddy.
All right.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.287
Which focus group
are you here for?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.388
Um...

01:29.290 --> 01:32.193
Oh, okay. Okay.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.928
New text coming in.
Me, uh, the --

01:34.962 --> 01:36.130
Oh, excuse me
one second.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.931
I'm sorry.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.433
Read it out loud.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.175
Oh, man.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.877
This is my buddy.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.280
His mother has
a very large nose.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.382
It almost looks like
a deviated septum, you know?

01:54.415 --> 01:56.550
And she
kind of talks...

01:56.584 --> 01:57.785
I mean, he's taking it
the wrong way, though.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.987
I got to write a --
oh, geez.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.429
Right?
Thank you.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.931
"You're a terrific guy."

02:10.964 --> 02:13.701
Oh, here we go.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.408
I did a hashtag.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.310
I didn't say her name
or my buddy's name,

02:22.343 --> 02:23.777
but I did #honkers.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.582
I said,
"Dude, I'm so sorry.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.883
You weren't
meant to see that.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.319
But my offer
is real."

02:32.386 --> 02:33.721
Here you go.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.056
Oh!
Ah, geez.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.058
Sal:
"Ah, geez."

02:38.091 --> 02:40.528
Do it, do it.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.767
He's going for it.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.872
I'll write,
"Oh, yeah?"

02:51.905 --> 02:53.541
Oh, my God,
this guy's perfect.
Oh!

02:53.574 --> 02:55.209
Dude, give me a "yo mama" joke
to write back.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.344
I got to
defend myself, here.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.446
Not only does he have
the guy's help,

02:58.479 --> 03:00.013
but the guy is
literally helping him

03:00.047 --> 03:01.482
insult someone's mother.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.150
Your mama's so fat...

03:03.183 --> 03:04.918
"Your mama's so fat..."

03:04.952 --> 03:09.257
...she looks like she ate
a live human being.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.591
**

03:10.624 --> 03:12.393
I hope
that was his side job.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.998
Wait, wait, wait!

03:19.833 --> 03:21.302
He beat me to it.
Are you kidding me?

03:21.335 --> 03:22.436
He just wrote...

03:27.308 --> 03:29.277
How is that...

03:29.310 --> 03:31.412
This is some "Carbonaro"
going on here.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.647
I'm writing him back.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.749
"I win
in the long run, jerks."

03:35.783 --> 03:39.887
Send.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.555
I've written
the first text.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.893
Oh. Oh, boy,
what do we got here?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.195
That's text
you don't want to get.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.032
What?

03:54.902 --> 03:55.969
Shoot.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.037
Oh!

03:57.070 --> 03:59.039
Nothing outrageous,
you know,

03:59.072 --> 04:00.408
just a little
light revenge.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.012
Oh,
is this another one?

04:09.817 --> 04:13.521
Yeah, I kind of
lost the dog in the breakup.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.956
So, what I did is,
had my friend start dating her,

04:15.989 --> 04:17.791
and I have
a look-alike dog.

04:17.825 --> 04:21.629
So, the plan is to,
like...swap the dogs.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.700
Joe:
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.101
The saga continues.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.338
What am I supposed to do?
He switched them.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.279
Sal:
He's loving it.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.616
He's, like, loving the situation
he finds himself in.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.984
What do you do
in this situation?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.389
I love this guy!
I love him!

04:48.422 --> 04:51.224
Q, good job, man.
Good job.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.126
You're really saving
my bacon, here, pal.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.062
Murr: Hold up.
One more text, one more text.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.598
Put -- put -- ah --
ah, give me a phone.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.199
Somebody give me a phone.
Somebody give me another phone.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.634
Start barking.
Start barking.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.035
I'll start barking.
I'll start barking.
Ready?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.971
You go, "Get off me,
get off me."

05:04.004 --> 05:06.407
I'm the cop, you're the guy,
you're the dog.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.577
Brian, It's me.
I'm running with the dog.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.712
Put your hands
where I can see them!

05:11.745 --> 05:13.514
Man,
I loved that dog.

05:13.547 --> 05:17.017
Oh. Oh, boy,
what do we got here?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.019
Murr: Brian, it's me.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.889
I'm running with the dog.
I'm running!

05:26.226 --> 05:28.829
Put your hands
where I can see them!

05:28.862 --> 05:30.731
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!

05:30.764 --> 05:33.033
Put your hands where
I can see them, now!

05:43.777 --> 05:46.213
Yeah, but you said,
"Take the dog and run."

05:46.246 --> 05:48.315
But when I said
"Take the dog and run,"

05:48.348 --> 05:49.983
I didn't
literally mean "run."

05:50.017 --> 05:51.685
Well,
that's what I told him!

05:53.020 --> 05:54.955
I know how to
get out of this.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.291
"New phone...
who dis?"

05:59.326 --> 06:00.928
That'll get us
out of this.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.130
Murr:
Well-done, Q.

06:03.163 --> 06:06.066
Are you doing
the dental focus group?

06:07.334 --> 06:09.336
I got it. I got it.
I got -- here we go.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.804
I did it a couple times.
It's cool. It's easy.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.706
It's like 15 minutes.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.542
Oh, got a text here.

06:14.575 --> 06:19.513
It says...

06:22.750 --> 06:24.017
Sal: Oh!
Murr: Uh!

06:28.756 --> 06:31.024
Oh, yeah, I can see
the confusion.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.560
I mean, Christmas is
something universal.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.862
Everybody celebrates
in some fashion, you know?

06:34.895 --> 06:38.065
Yeah. I mean, it's out there
in the commercial world and...

06:38.098 --> 06:39.399
Here we go.
Here we go.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.201
Oh.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.576
Yeah...

06:48.609 --> 06:51.579
That's well-played,
there.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.149
You went
for the kill.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.286
**

07:01.388 --> 07:03.891
It still says it.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.432
Oh, my God, I've never
seen Joe this way!

07:12.466 --> 07:18.405
Staring at it's not
gonna change it, Joe.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.643
Are they ready
for me?

07:24.612 --> 07:27.815
He's out.
He's out.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.583
What, you guys don't think
I'm gonna say it?

07:29.617 --> 07:32.452
Oh!
Oh, no.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.321
I would suggest
you not say it.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.790
Don't you dare.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.561
"Also, super odd
that you would do

07:40.594 --> 07:42.262
a black Santa
when you're white."

07:42.295 --> 07:43.631
Oh.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.968
All that worrying
for nothing.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.637
What should I write back
to that one?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.343
Wow.
Thank you for that.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.978
I appreciate that.
That's well-said.

07:59.479 --> 08:04.284
Sal,
the texts begin now.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.520
**

08:12.292 --> 08:15.796
Oh, man.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.665
My friend
just texted me,

08:17.698 --> 08:19.767
"I just saw your balls
on the news."

08:23.370 --> 08:25.438
Ugh. 'Cause I know
what he's talking about.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.507
A bunch of bullies
from the neighborhood tied me

08:27.541 --> 08:29.376
to the goalpost
over at the school, there,

08:29.409 --> 08:30.744
and they pulled
my pants down.

08:30.778 --> 08:34.314
So, they videotaped it,
and they put it on YouTube.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.415
Yeah.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.087
I guess it went viral,
and now, he did probably saw --

08:40.120 --> 08:42.022
Oh, here we go.
New text!

08:47.394 --> 08:50.598
I live
by the school,

08:50.631 --> 08:52.600
and the eighth graders
do this thing, you know,

08:52.633 --> 08:54.668
a spring-break
ritual tradition

08:54.702 --> 08:56.136
where they haze people.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.338
And I work on that block,
so I pass the schoolyard.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.573
All of a sudden,
before you know it,

08:59.607 --> 09:02.175
I'm on the goalpost
of the soccer field.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.011
And then, they did
the Snapchat and everything.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.379
And then, they put a cat face
on my balls and all that stuff.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.547
They thought
it was funny, like,

09:07.581 --> 09:09.983
they put all the filters
on my balls and stuff.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.219
New text coming in.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.290
Okay.
Oh, what is this now?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.359
A video.
Look at this.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.732
Joe:
"Dude, saw your balls on TV!

09:24.765 --> 09:26.399
You're famous, bro!

09:26.433 --> 09:28.736
Balls! Balls! Balls!

09:34.207 --> 09:35.676
Yeah.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.745
I can't
get it to stop.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.749
This thing won't stop.
It's on loop.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.393
That's the big issue
is that

09:53.426 --> 09:55.996
she is the one
that's not enforcing anything.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.365
She's not even recognizing
the fact that his phone

09:58.398 --> 10:00.333
is just yelling,
"Balls!"

10:00.367 --> 10:03.570
You know
what I'm saying?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.472
What's the word?

10:05.505 --> 10:06.774
Balls! Balls! Balls!

10:06.807 --> 10:08.141
"Balls"?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.843
No.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.578
Taveres.
Taveres Jackson?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.613
Are you guys --
Oh, wait.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.017
Don't even say it.
Are you kidding me?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.385
You're the balls guy!

10:18.418 --> 10:20.287
Oh, my God.
Aw, man.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.822
Dude!

10:23.824 --> 10:26.794
Balls!
Guys, "Balls" is here!

10:26.827 --> 10:29.663
Laugh at it. "Balls," like...
Just laugh at it.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.265
Just laugh at it.
Just laugh at it.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.734
I just want
to save face.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.468
What would be a good thing
to tell them back

10:35.502 --> 10:37.204
where it just puts this
to bed for now?

10:40.540 --> 10:43.243
Joe: And after all that,
she didn't help you write back.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.947
Narrator:
Sal's not LOLing

10:46.980 --> 10:50.017
because he's first up
on the loser board.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.651
Tonight, we're competing
head-to-head

10:51.685 --> 10:54.321
at a single's mixer hosted
by the dating app Bumble.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.023
One of us will be trying
to get a girl's number

10:56.056 --> 10:57.691
while the other guy
plays his wingman.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.159
Catch is,
the wingman will be doing

10:59.192 --> 11:02.062
everything he can to sabotage
the other guy's chances.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.764
If you get a phone number,
you win.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.599
If you don't get a number,
the wingman wins.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.068
We're back
in the game, boys.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.169
Don't tell my wife.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.810
Murr's trying
to get a number.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.211
Yeah, and Q's got to
sabotage him.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.647
Anything you dish out,
I can explain away.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.449
Oh, you think
you got that, huh?
Guaranteed.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.152
Okay, watch this.
Excuse me, excuse me.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.020
My friend's been
staring at you for 20 minutes.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.789
He won't stop. It's weird,
and I apologize for that.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.690
I have. I have.
You are so beautiful,

11:30.724 --> 11:32.159
and I can't --
I'm sort of shy.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.561
And we're in.
He's my wingman tonight,
so...

11:34.594 --> 11:37.164
Oh, I'm the wingman,
yeah.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.199
Yeah, like, just last night
alone, what did you take home,

11:39.232 --> 11:41.434
three different girls last night
'cause of me?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.136
No, no, no, no, no.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.838
I drive for Uber.
I'm an Uber driver.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.307
Oh.
I took three
different girls home.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.309
Oh, nice.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.611
You were saying that
the girls here are too old.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.914
Like, I feel like
the old one.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.549
Nice, Q.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.617
Ouch.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.287
He thought
you were 32.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.293
Um, but -- I mean...

12:10.397 --> 12:12.232
That's the game.
That is the game.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.466
Can I get
your phone number?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.769
Oh. Oh, yeah.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.605
You're not
in my age group?

12:18.638 --> 12:19.873
So, wait,
what just happened?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.678
Well-played.

12:25.712 --> 12:28.015
Joe:
Best in the business.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.651
There's two right there.
Two bitties right there.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.186
"Two bitties."

12:33.220 --> 12:34.654
You went old school,
like when we used to hang out.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.025
To be clear,
Joe used to say "bitties."

12:38.058 --> 12:39.993
Are you two
on a date

12:40.027 --> 12:41.361
or are you gonna start
talking to other people?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.563
Where'd you get
them egg rolls?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.933
Where do you
get them?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.969
Hey.
How are you?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.237
This is
my friend Sal.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.039
Joe: What are we drinking?
Jameson and ginger ale.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.573
Oh, Jameson
and ginger ale.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.908
Yeah, he used to be
a bartender.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.343
So, he started --

12:56.376 --> 12:57.811
Well,
I owned the bar.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.813
No more Jameson
for me.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.781
Oh, they own a bar?
Do you go there a lot?

13:02.816 --> 13:04.617
It's in Guam.
You've been to Guam.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.154
Yeah, I've been
to Guam three times.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.190
I know the, uh -- the, uh --
not the mayor of Guam --

13:10.223 --> 13:11.691
what's it called?
The ambassador.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.894
The ambassador.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.228
That's right, yeah.
So...

13:15.262 --> 13:17.797
Okay, 'cause...

13:17.831 --> 13:20.367
Joe is trying to undercut
Sal's credibility.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.801
The governor.
The governor.
Yeah.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.571
The governor and his family
is friends with my family.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.273
So, it's just weird
that you're from Guam

13:26.306 --> 13:27.607
'cause I wrote
to the governor yesterday.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.342
Yeah. Tell her about
your depression.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.846
Nice one, Joey.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.515
I used to be depressed.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.218
So, can he get
your number?

13:38.251 --> 13:39.486
You want
to give him your number?

13:39.519 --> 13:40.720
I didn't --
he's just kidding.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.990
Anybody want
to give him your number?

13:43.023 --> 13:44.091
I would love it.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.260
Really? Okay.
Murr: Oh!

13:47.294 --> 13:49.762
I know he's being forward,
but that's cool.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.499
Hey, why I'm here.
I'm your wingman.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.267
Narrator: Murr and Joe
don't need a date

13:54.301 --> 13:56.036
because they're keeping
each other company

13:56.069 --> 13:58.005
on the loser board.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.606
Today,
we're at Lot-Less,

13:59.639 --> 14:01.841
and Q and I
are feeling awfully down.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.043
What's bothering us?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.511
Oh, don't worry.
Sal and I are gonna tell you.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.578
Yeah, and then,
after we tell you,

14:05.612 --> 14:06.779
you have to
go up to a shopper

14:06.813 --> 14:09.216
and get them to encourage you,
no matter what we say.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.418
I can't do it, man.
Well, if you can't,
you lose.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.490
Joe: Oh, this guy
looks depressed.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.092
Oh, that's Q.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.560
Aw, you look down,
bud.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.930
Sal: Q, you sure you don't want
to play this game for real?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.731
And just, like, you know,
just tell somebody

14:24.764 --> 14:26.066
what you're feeling
so down about?

14:26.099 --> 14:27.935
That's
Classic Steakhouse?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.637
Oh, okay, thank you.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.040
You know what, I'm just
having the worst day.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.975
"I'm having trouble
with the neighborhood bully."

14:35.008 --> 14:37.010
I'm having trouble
with my neighborhood bully.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.447
He's not bothering me. No,
no, no, he's not bothering me.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.350
I'm paying him
to bully my daughter.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.087
I'm paying him
to toughen up my daughter.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.721
But I don't think
he's harsh enough.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.657
I don't think
he's --

14:50.690 --> 14:53.260
Wait.
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.427
No, no.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.430
This is called "discouragement
and abandonment."

14:57.464 --> 15:00.633
So, you think
I've wasted $5,000?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.806
No.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.110
That was the clearest loss
we've ever had.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.547
Do you know if these
are any good?

15:14.581 --> 15:15.582
It's to cheer me up.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.916
"I've been writing
a letter

15:16.950 --> 15:18.385
for the past six months,
every day."

15:18.418 --> 15:20.120
For the past six months, every
day, I've been writing a letter.

15:20.153 --> 15:23.256
"And I can't get Danica McKellar
to write me back."

15:23.290 --> 15:25.959
And I can't get
Danica McKellar to read it.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.427
Do you know who
Danica McKellar is?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.429
Do you remember the TV show
"The Wonder Years"

15:29.462 --> 15:30.730
in the '80s?
Remember?
Yeah.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.665
You know, Winnie Cooper,
who was the little girl?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.467
That's Danica McKellar.
I still have a crush on her.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.736
I've been writing her a letter
every day for six months --

15:36.769 --> 15:38.705
182 1/2 letters --

15:38.738 --> 15:40.173
and she just hasn't
written me back.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.777
So,
that's my situation.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.181
What do you think?

15:49.749 --> 15:50.950
Well, that's neither
here nor there.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.956
Writing letters.

15:56.990 --> 16:00.160
Yeah, 182.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.231
That would be discouraging
my current behavior,

16:04.264 --> 16:06.533
and that's the opposite
of what I need, here.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.205
That's discouraging.
That's discouraging.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.776
Narrator: Murr's gonna need all
the encouragement he can get,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.546
'cause he's about
to be punished.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.713
All right,
all right.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.215
Somebody's missing.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.216
Oh, there's a reason
for that.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.152
We've talked about,
for years,

16:25.185 --> 16:28.288
shaving Q's head
to his scalp

16:28.321 --> 16:30.923
and making a wig
out of his luscious locks

16:30.957 --> 16:33.226
and forcing Murray
to wear it.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.694
Yeah.
But here's the thing --
we're about to do that,

16:34.727 --> 16:36.396
and Murray's
gonna have to wear it

16:36.429 --> 16:38.231
for the rest
of the season.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.134
Okay, have a seat.
Let's get Andrew in here.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.803
We're bringing in our friend
Andrew of Andrew DiSimone Wigs.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.672
What's up, Q?
How you doing?
Good. Listen --

16:45.705 --> 16:47.074
Best in the business?
That's right, baby.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.309
'Cause I don't trust this hair
to just anybody.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.878
No problem.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.281
**

16:54.314 --> 16:56.616
Oh, the front's
the first?

16:56.649 --> 16:59.786
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.788
You look crazy!

17:03.556 --> 17:08.828
Wow.
Oh, my God.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.665
**

17:15.102 --> 17:19.206
There it is.
Wow.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.874
You look like a complete
psychopath right now.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.876
Baby steps through.
Baby steps through.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.178
Come on,
what's going on?

17:25.212 --> 17:26.346
Here we go.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.485
Aah!
What is this?!

17:32.519 --> 17:33.853
Oh, my God!

17:33.886 --> 17:36.489
No, no!
That hair's
going on that head.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.527
You know
how we always said

17:40.560 --> 17:42.129
how funny it'd be to make
a wig of his hair

17:42.162 --> 17:43.830
that you have to wear
for the rest of the season?

17:43.863 --> 17:47.066
That was a joke, guys!
Oh, that was no joke!

17:50.170 --> 17:52.505
And here we are.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.208
Here it is? This is it.
Release the kraken.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.076
Let's do this.
One...

17:57.110 --> 17:59.078
All:
...two, three.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.414
Oh, my God!

18:01.448 --> 18:03.616
It's got the wave.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.885
Q:
Oh, my God.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.254
Ew!
Whoa!

18:07.287 --> 18:09.622
Oh, my God.
All right, here we go.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.324
All right. Here we go.
Turn around.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.260
You got to
turn around.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.262
Don't look!
You're looking over my shoulder.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.263
I saw you!

18:16.296 --> 18:17.564
Oh, my God!

18:17.597 --> 18:19.031
Murr:
On three, turn around.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.000
One, two, three.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.006
Look at this.
Look.
What does
it look like?

18:27.039 --> 18:28.275
Is it bad?

18:28.308 --> 18:29.276
Oh, my God!

18:31.311 --> 18:33.213
Oh, my God.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.948
So, Murr, you have to
go get a passport photo.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.019
We made you get
a driver's-license photo

18:40.052 --> 18:42.289
when you had no hair
on your head.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.357
And now we're making you
get a passport photo

18:44.391 --> 18:45.658
when you have that.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.194
Stop screwing with
my travel!

18:47.227 --> 18:49.028
How long does a passport --
isn't it like 10 years?

18:49.061 --> 18:50.830
10 years.

18:50.863 --> 18:51.898
So, you just
have to go ask people

18:51.931 --> 18:54.000
where the
passport office is.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.402
Q: I don't think you're ready
for the responsibility

18:55.435 --> 18:56.903
of having
great hair like that.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.506
You think it's just flipping
around looking sexy, it's not.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.940
With great hair
comes great responsibility.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.175
Yeah, you got
that right, pal.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.643
It smells like Q.

19:03.676 --> 19:04.944
What does
it smell like?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.814
It smells like whiskey
and pot.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.084
All you got to do is find
the passport place, buddy.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.353
I'm in
a hairy situation.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.054
I got to get
a new passport fast.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.823
I'm choking on my hair.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.758
Oh, okay.
I got plenty more,
so it's okay.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.293
It's okay.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.161
When you go there, is it free
or do you have to pay?

19:22.195 --> 19:23.930
You have to pay.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.568
Q, how did you have this
on your head?

19:28.601 --> 19:30.470
This is day one.
Yeah.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.671
This is months.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.939
We're coming into
the summertime, too.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.275
Do I have to comb it?
Do I have to wash it?

19:35.308 --> 19:36.909
No, you can't wash it
or comb it.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.045
That's as fresh as the hair's
gonna be, right now.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.747
It's only getting worse,
is your point?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.682
It's deteriorating.
It's like me.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.118
So, that's it.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.620
Now you got to go
get a passport photo.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.523
Man: Guess what came in.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.992
Is this
my passport?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.461
No!

19:54.494 --> 19:56.996
Oh, my God.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.299
Are you kidding me?!
Oh, my God.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.767
Wow. You are never
getting through TSA.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.769
Oh, my God.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.504
Do you have your license
on you?

20:04.537 --> 20:07.139
Look at this.
You know what's funny?

20:07.173 --> 20:08.841
When he doesn't
have the hair

20:08.875 --> 20:10.209
and he shows this,
they're gonna be like,

20:10.243 --> 20:11.578
"What? Do you have
anything else?"

20:11.611 --> 20:13.746
And it's that.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.282
He takes
the license out.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.216
You need two proofs of ID?
There you go.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.185
Well, the good news is,
your hair came in really nice.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.191
Hey, it's Q,
here with Casey.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.926
You're watching
"Impractical Insider",

20:26.959 --> 20:28.661
and you are in
for a treat.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.997
We got some stuff that we had to
cut out of the episode.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.132
A lot of stuff got cut, and now,
you get to watch bonus footage.

20:33.165 --> 20:36.202
Yeah.
And when I say
a lot of stuff got cut...

20:36.235 --> 20:39.472
Yeah.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.043
Q: Wow.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.578
It would kind of be funny
if you guys were like,

20:45.612 --> 20:47.547
"Nah, there's
no punishment for Murr."

20:48.581 --> 20:50.216
We said this
as a joke.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.584
We were drunk
when we said this.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.085
Yeah, but we
wrote it down, though.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.455
That's the problem.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.956
This is crazy.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.359
They called it
a "Q-pée."

21:00.393 --> 21:01.594
That's nice --
Q-pée.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.296
I used to have this
for years.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.164
I walked around like this
for three years straight.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.333
Sal, actually,
said the best thing.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.034
We were driving one night,
and he said,

21:08.067 --> 21:10.670
"I feel like we're
hanging out in our 20s."

21:10.703 --> 21:12.805
'Cause that was, like,
from the time

21:12.839 --> 21:14.374
I was 28 to the time
I was, like, 31

21:14.407 --> 21:15.842
is when I had it.
Right, right.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.378
And he's like, "I feel like
we're back, like, hanging out."

21:18.411 --> 21:20.747
And here we are.
Here it is.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.782
Oh, my God!

21:22.815 --> 21:24.984
It's got the wave!

21:25.017 --> 21:26.653
Oh, my God.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.054
Are you that grey?

21:28.087 --> 21:30.089
Oh, my God. This is what
my hair looked like?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.624
Do you know
how hot it is?
Sal: Is it hot?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.760
Yeah, it's so hot.
Oh, today's mild, too.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.463
You're not gonna have
a good go this summer.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.266
When the wig was completed,
it was in my bedroom

21:40.299 --> 21:41.968
'cause it was the safest place
in the house.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.470
That makes sense.
That's where I'd put it.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.204
All of a sudden, I walk into the
room and I'm smelling something.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.939
And I asked my wife,
"What's that smell?"

21:46.973 --> 21:50.076
And it was Q.
It was another man.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.811
It smells like
a smoky scent.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.746
Q: Can I put that on,
or won't it fit my head?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.682
I'm not sure.
Oh, please, put it on.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.783
Oh, yes.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.353
This looks like
Revolutionary War

22:00.387 --> 22:02.088
Like I'm about to bust in
and be, like,

22:02.121 --> 22:05.257
"Ah, no taxation
without representation!"

22:05.291 --> 22:07.126
Is the passport office
this way or this way?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.160
Do you know?

22:08.194 --> 22:09.295
You're in Washington --

22:09.328 --> 22:11.163
I'm in it, but...
I got to find it fast.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.500
I don't want to wig out.
I got to get there fast.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.904
Bud, do you know,
is the passport office this way?

22:17.937 --> 22:19.872
Q: "You're bald, huh?"

22:19.906 --> 22:22.842
I used to be bald, too,
but not anymore.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.545
Sal: Murr, shoot us
completely straight --

22:25.578 --> 22:28.014
do you, like,
feel more confident right now?

22:28.047 --> 22:30.550
I do.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.486
And the fun continues.

22:38.925 --> 22:42.395
'Cause I brought a whole
entourage to really sell it.

22:42.429 --> 22:46.198
He's showing up
with reindeer and elves.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.668
In March,
at a Jewish school.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.937
"Of course I'm vetting.
I'm not an animal."

22:50.970 --> 22:52.539
I got one.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.107
Oh.
Oh, that's unfortunate.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.680
That's one of
the reindeer...

23:01.914 --> 23:03.416
Now, that wasn't
my intention.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.318
Aw, Blitzen straight
rocked Little Karl.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.192
Blitzen, why you got to
do it like that?

23:14.360 --> 23:16.596
I'll start barking.
I'll start barking.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.930
Sal: Ready?
Wait a second. Ready?

23:17.964 --> 23:19.432
You go, "Get off me.
Get off me."

23:19.466 --> 23:20.967
Wait,
how do you record audio?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.869
You press that button
and hold it.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.336
Got it.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.838
Put your hands
behind your back!

23:28.407 --> 23:30.877
I said, "Put you hands
where I can see them!"

23:39.752 --> 23:41.053
The funny thing --

23:41.087 --> 23:43.556
why'd the bullet
happen so late?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.960
It didn't record.
