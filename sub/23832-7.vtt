WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:15.515 --> 00:19.936
Midari, I don't recommend
pulling the trigger on that gun.

00:20.020 --> 00:24.441
You're begging for your life?
Man, how boring!

00:24.524 --> 00:27.444
That's my gun. Look at the barrel.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.447
It has a red mark, right?

00:31.740 --> 00:35.076
I filled the barrel with lipstick.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.248
I put three bullets in.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.753
In other words, there's a three
in six chance the gun will misfire.

00:45.503 --> 00:49.799
That's 50 percent,
and you're taking all the risk.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.596
No luck, huh?

00:55.013 --> 00:58.391
That was a lie.
I didn't put a single bullet in.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.351
What? Seriously?

01:01.853 --> 01:02.687
Jeez.

01:03.271 --> 01:07.859
By the way, it seems that lipstick
isn't enough to cause a gun to misfire.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.404
I don't care.
Let's go on to the next round.

01:11.946 --> 01:16.576
Midari, why did you ask me
to play this game?

01:18.328 --> 01:21.414
Why else? For the thrill of it!

01:21.498 --> 01:25.043
The thrill of risking your life
is pure joy!

01:25.126 --> 01:29.756
I want to go numb to a thrill
you could never get in real life!

01:31.049 --> 01:35.678
Money's not good enough.
It doesn't make me feel anything.

01:36.137 --> 01:42.811
No matter how much I make or lose,
it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter...

01:47.148 --> 01:52.028
I can't see out of my left eye at all.
Why do you think that is?

01:52.112 --> 01:56.574
The president took it as the prize
for a gambling match!

03:39.719 --> 03:41.888
Something always felt off
since I was little.

03:42.472 --> 03:47.852
Winning, praise, the fear of others,
even when I made a fortune at the academy.

03:48.436 --> 03:52.523
None of it really made me happy.

03:53.733 --> 03:57.946
Now, you owe 300 million yen.

03:59.155 --> 04:05.495
- Do you have a way to pay it?
- Of course not!

04:06.162 --> 04:09.666
Gambling's so damn boring.

04:10.208 --> 04:14.087
Debt doesn't mean a goddamn thing to me.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.883
I see. That lack of fear
is what makes you good at gambling.

04:19.717 --> 04:25.223
I'd prefer people like you
pay with your lives, not money.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.977
But you're not the type men really like.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.188
You may not be appropriate
for a life plan.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.482
I know...

04:40.446 --> 04:44.242
The other side. Have you ever seen
the other side of the moon?

04:45.326 --> 04:47.078
Of course you haven't.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.748
Perhaps you've seen a picture of it.
But I've never seen it for myself.

04:51.332 --> 04:57.213
Everyone's just lying to me.
Maybe there's an alien base there.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.882
You can't totally deny
that ridiculous idea, can you?

05:01.009 --> 05:01.926
What are you--?

05:04.846 --> 05:09.183
I just realized that I've never seen
the back of someone's eye socket.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.439
I'll buy your left eye
for 300 million yen.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.442
What color is the back of an eye?

05:17.525 --> 05:21.946
Where are the nerves? How do they connect?
How does it smell? Is there blood?

05:22.030 --> 05:25.950
I want to know, not from reading it
in a book, but from seeing it myself.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.829
She doesn't see me as human.

05:30.663 --> 05:35.460
We can do the removal operation tomorrow.
You have class. We can do it after school.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.966
You're insane! You're a pervert!

05:42.050 --> 05:43.217
President!

05:53.478 --> 05:54.771
Impressive.

06:04.155 --> 06:09.243
I see. Yes, I've never seen anyone
tear their own eye out.

06:11.621 --> 06:16.918
It wasn't that interesting.
Thanks. You can go.

06:23.591 --> 06:28.554
That's not fair!
I... stabbed out my eye!

06:30.139 --> 06:33.643
This was your idea, right?
Take more pleasure in it!

06:33.726 --> 06:37.063
I told you, I'm satisfied. Thanks.

06:38.314 --> 06:44.570
I finally understand...
Pain... This pain is true gambling!

06:44.654 --> 06:48.574
President, one more time!
Let's gamble once more!

06:49.158 --> 06:52.954
You're out of money, right?
I've seen what I had to see.

06:53.037 --> 06:57.875
- There's no point to gamble with you.
- I've got another eye, right?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.837
Let's gamble once more
for 300 million yen.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.714
Midari, join the student council.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.385
Not interested! I just want to gamble--

07:08.302 --> 07:10.221
If you do...

07:11.055 --> 07:12.640
someday, I'll kill you.

07:15.810 --> 07:20.148
It was the greatest experience of my life.
My brain went numb.

07:20.815 --> 07:24.735
I finally understood why
the whole world loves to gamble.

07:24.819 --> 07:29.615
I don't want the pain. I don't want
to die. That's what makes it great!

07:29.699 --> 07:31.742
You're the same, right, Yumeko?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.203
I couldn't say.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.249
Don't even try to hide it.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.378
I told you that we're the same.
That's how I know.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.132
The president's the greatest,
but she refuses to do it with me.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.260
So, I'm counting on you, Yumeko.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.387
It's time for round two.

07:51.888 --> 07:56.392
How do I line these up? Unlike
the first round, where there was no hint,

07:56.476 --> 08:00.062
this time there's information
that Yumeko and I definitely share.

08:00.146 --> 08:06.068
The way all three of us lined our cards up
in round one Me, Ikishima, Yumeko.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.071
I should match one of our hands.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.617
Yumeko would know
that my brain is only capable

08:12.700 --> 08:14.869
of coming up with those three options.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.246
But the problem is...

08:18.164 --> 08:21.584
I only remember how my cards
and Yumeko's were lined up

08:21.667 --> 08:23.836
since that's all I was looking at.

08:25.963 --> 08:29.592
Wait. Isn't it normal
not to remember them all?

08:30.176 --> 08:33.888
Normally, you couldn't remember
the order of three sets of five cards.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.723
If Ikishima remembers something,

08:35.806 --> 08:39.143
she'd be more likely to remember
my cards instead of Yumeko's.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.021
But that's not true for Yumeko.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.399
I can say for sure that Yumeko
remembers all the hands.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.945
That's it! I'll copy Yumeko's hand
from round one.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.950
I'll only say this once more.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.453
Mary, join the student council.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.334
May I ask one question?

09:04.502 --> 09:07.630
What is it? I'll be happy
to answer any questions.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.593
It's about the house pet system.

09:12.677 --> 09:18.391
The way you turn humans into house pets
is terrible. Why do you go that far?

09:24.647 --> 09:25.815
Pretty, isn't it?

09:26.774 --> 09:31.821
But even these cute fish live in a world
where it's survival of the fittest.

09:32.530 --> 09:36.784
If you gathered the fish at the bottom
of the food chain, what would happen?

09:38.244 --> 09:42.164
A new bottom would form.

09:42.832 --> 09:47.962
And sometimes, the weak fish
would steal food from the strong.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.008
So, what if these were humans?

09:52.842 --> 09:57.013
I want to see for myself.
I'm very curious.

09:59.181 --> 10:03.394
The odds this game will end in a tie
are 100 percent.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.188
Hey! What are you talking about?

10:06.272 --> 10:08.691
The risk of gambling
is the greatest pleasure!

10:08.774 --> 10:13.613
You and I are the same that way, right?
You want to risk death with me, right?

10:14.196 --> 10:16.032
Risk death, huh?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.619
I was right to limit it to three games.

10:19.702 --> 10:24.874
You're lying! You want to feel
the risk of death if you lose, right?

10:24.957 --> 10:28.586
No. I'm not feeling
any fear at all right now.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.131
Because I believe in Ryota.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.928
I'm putting in six bullets!
If you think you can get a draw, then try!

10:38.721 --> 10:40.181
As you wish.

10:43.768 --> 10:48.689
I hope Yumeko sees what I'm trying to do.
Please... I'm begging you!

10:49.440 --> 10:50.691
You're ready, right?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.693
Show your cards.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.744
Five to three. Yumeko wins!

11:06.832 --> 11:08.459
She got all five right?

11:08.876 --> 11:11.754
Without any sign...
How could she do that?

11:12.421 --> 11:13.923
It can't be a coincidence.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.259
Trying to get them right means
taking the risk of getting them wrong.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.304
She took the risk to get results.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.265
Yumeko.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.769
You really were just who I hoped you were.

11:28.687 --> 11:31.774
Midari, are you ready?

11:33.109 --> 11:34.777
I sure am! Aim carefully!

11:35.361 --> 11:36.779
One in two...

11:36.862 --> 11:40.199
There's a one in two chance
the bullet comes out.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.786
It's way better than that was.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.591
I'm gonna die!

12:08.269 --> 12:09.103
No luck?

12:09.186 --> 12:13.941
Nope. This is my gun. The second chamber
doesn't contain a bullet either.

12:15.401 --> 12:21.115
You're so cold.
You're not scared to fire? You sadist!

12:21.198 --> 12:25.619
I'm not. I knew this was my gun.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.874
The bullets weigh something, right?
There's a difference of six bullets.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.376
This gun doesn't even weigh
a kilogram, right?

12:32.960 --> 12:35.629
But the bullets probably weigh
15 grams apiece.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.423
That's a ten percent difference.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.633
I can tell that.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.013
That's right. You can tell.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.975
Of course you can't!
What's the deal with your senses?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.227
But I was able to tell.

12:51.061 --> 12:56.233
That's inhuman.
At this rate, I'm going to lose for sure.

12:56.317 --> 13:00.738
Yumeko really is amazing.
She read my mind perfectly.

13:00.821 --> 13:04.742
Yes. Understood.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.911
Ryota, time for game three.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.830
I can help her get all of it again.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.461
What is this? That's cheating!

13:17.838 --> 13:20.424
What is this?

13:21.008 --> 13:22.301
That's cheating! Cheating!

13:22.384 --> 13:24.470
Right. Just line up the cards.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.640
Shut up! She could get killed! You can't--

13:27.723 --> 13:31.477
Ryota! Line up the goddamn cards!

13:31.560 --> 13:37.316
If you can't do it in ten seconds,
I'll kill Yumeko! Ten, nine...

13:37.399 --> 13:41.320
- No way! If she does that, Yumeko will...
- ...eight, seven, six, five...

13:41.403 --> 13:45.908
I have to line them up.
It's no good. I can't think of anything.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.576
And if I can't...

13:50.913 --> 13:51.830
Okay.

13:52.957 --> 13:53.832
Yumeko.

13:58.170 --> 14:02.091
Midari, that isn't very nice
of you at all.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.095
This is your punishment.
I put two bullets in.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.939
You're the best!

14:17.022 --> 14:21.443
I had the wrong idea. I thought you were
like me, that you rejoice in risk-taking.

14:22.027 --> 14:26.448
But I was wrong! You're a thinker.
The same type as the president!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.786
If you're putting in two bullets, so am I.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.290
No. How can she do that
in this circumstance?

14:38.878 --> 14:43.048
You're ready, right, Yumeko?
Reveal the cards.

14:52.057 --> 14:52.892
How boring.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.396
Did you know that Ryota is right-handed?

14:58.355 --> 15:03.027
But for the first two games,
he used his left hand to flip the cards.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.406
In addition to that,
the wave card was backwards.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.410
Which means one thing.

15:12.244 --> 15:17.416
The video we saw was reflected in
a mirror. Left and right were backwards.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.419
But now, he's using his right hand.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.672
In other words,
this time there's no reflection.

15:24.214 --> 15:27.134
But that doesn't explain
how Ryota was able to recreate

15:27.217 --> 15:29.929
the way I lined up my cards
in the second game.

15:30.012 --> 15:34.183
He should've lined it up backwards.
But that wasn't what happened.

15:34.975 --> 15:40.439
Which means our image
was reversed as well.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.443
We were both looking at reversed images.

15:45.152 --> 15:48.447
There's no way you could trick someone
with such a stupid cheat.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.951
Please don't insult me, okay?

15:52.701 --> 15:55.454
Ryota's actions
were just what I predicted.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.248
She took this cheating into account

15:58.332 --> 16:00.501
and perfectly incorporated it
into her plan.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.379
I knew I couldn't beat her.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.590
Yumeko, congratulations.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.094
You lose.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.727
How?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.729
She got them all wrong!

16:20.813 --> 16:22.398
I can't believe it!

16:22.481 --> 16:25.734
I can't believe a girl like you
appeared before me!

16:26.819 --> 16:31.240
I can't take it anymore.
It's your turn. Show your cards, Yumeko!

16:31.907 --> 16:35.869
I've been looking so long...
for the greatest woman imaginable,

16:35.953 --> 16:37.746
one like the president.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.748
Control me! Please!

16:40.332 --> 16:45.671
Like the boy you keep with you.
Let me join you.

16:45.754 --> 16:50.092
I wanted a girl like you to kill me.
I'll entrust you with everything.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.595
Rule over everything I have!

16:53.679 --> 16:58.726
Show your hand and let me die!

16:58.809 --> 17:01.729
You, it has to be you!

17:01.812 --> 17:03.480
Anything else is just masturbation.

17:03.564 --> 17:08.610
You're the only way I can feel
the joy I felt on that day. Do it!

17:10.195 --> 17:12.239
This is just what I expected.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.035
I knew instantly
that you were trying to lose.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.246
Why'd you agree
to let Ryota be the dealer?

17:19.329 --> 17:22.624
You didn't have any guarantee
that we didn't have a sign.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.626
No, wait...

17:24.710 --> 17:28.255
The only reason you pulled the trigger
without hesitation during the first game

17:28.338 --> 17:31.550
was that you didn't care
if you were in danger.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.927
Well, that's fine, though.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.638
But this is just terrible.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.642
Wait! Hey, don't flip over another card.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.146
This particular cheat
was made to be found out.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.023
This wave card.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.569
What if there was another wave on it?

17:50.652 --> 17:54.156
You couldn't tell if it just happened
to be upside-down.

17:54.740 --> 17:59.161
You can't have done all this
just to win the game. So, why?

18:00.204 --> 18:04.166
Victory to you is being killed.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.086
That is your victory condition.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.673
Yumeko got everything wrong too!
It's a draw again!

18:13.175 --> 18:17.679
This doesn't make sense. It doesn't
make any sense. It just doesn't.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.309
Why put two bullets in? You could've
put in zero since you knew you'd win.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.603
Putting in two
and then getting them all wrong

18:24.686 --> 18:26.688
just increases the risk you'll get shot.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.943
It's simple.
There are six chambers in the gun.

18:31.026 --> 18:34.696
After I put in two bullets,
there were four chambers left.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.700
If the score difference was five,
one bullet would definitely be fired.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.204
If you get all five cards wrong,
a tie's impossible.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.623
I knew that that's what you'd think.

18:45.791 --> 18:50.712
If you decided to get one or two right,
I might get shot.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.382
This isn't gambling.

18:54.091 --> 18:58.220
It's just a stupid game, pointless,
and not even entertaining!

18:58.804 --> 19:02.850
You just said
that you and I weren't alike, right?

19:02.933 --> 19:04.226
I agree.

19:04.309 --> 19:08.147
Gambling is fun because both sides
have the chance to feel pain.

19:08.605 --> 19:12.234
Why are you trying to monopolize
all the pain for yourself?

19:13.026 --> 19:17.823
You're not enjoying the gambling.
You just want to die!

19:18.448 --> 19:21.243
You're the type I hate most.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.745
In short...

19:25.455 --> 19:28.876
you piss me off!

19:31.461 --> 19:33.755
What is she saying?

19:34.631 --> 19:38.677
She risked death
to force the game to a tie.

19:40.262 --> 19:46.185
She's insane. She's far beyond
what I imagined, what I dreamed!

19:46.768 --> 19:48.187
Yumeko!

19:48.270 --> 19:51.607
You're my goddess!

19:53.775 --> 20:00.699
- This was a waste of time, huh?
- Yumeko! Wait!

20:00.782 --> 20:03.452
Yume... it has to be you!

20:03.869 --> 20:07.456
Just one shot is all I need!
Give me pain, please!

20:10.042 --> 20:11.293
THE GIRLS THAT REFUSE

20:11.376 --> 20:12.961
I refuse.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.963
What did you say?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.466
Did you not hear me?

20:18.050 --> 20:21.303
I said I refuse to join
the student council.

20:22.179 --> 20:26.683
May I ask why? You don't like
the way we treat house pets?

20:27.392 --> 20:30.395
You have a strong sense of justice?

20:31.813 --> 20:33.857
I don't have to answer that.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.321
Goodbye.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.373
Is Yumeko upset?

20:49.998 --> 20:51.416
- Ryota?
- Yes?

20:51.500 --> 20:56.338
Want to go to a sweets buffet?
The coin flip determines who pays.

20:56.922 --> 20:57.839
Tails, it's me.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.842
Heads, it's you. How about it?

21:01.718 --> 21:04.388
No, things are pretty tight this month.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.847
Are you absolutely sure?

21:09.476 --> 21:11.853
Fine, I'm a man. I'll do it.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.522
Thank you.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.315
Here we go.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.823
Please. Tails.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.492
May I ask something?

21:26.368 --> 21:29.121
Why did you keep recreating my hand

21:29.204 --> 21:31.290
even though you realized
they were cheating?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.792
Why are you asking?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.002
Please.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.296
I want an answer.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.424
Well, there was no time.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.302
I couldn't really think.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.556
And actually...

21:47.639 --> 21:49.016
to be honest...

21:49.725 --> 21:54.229
I thought you'd realize
that I didn't know what to do.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.066
I hoped you would.

21:59.651 --> 22:04.323
I'm sorry. I know that with your life
on the line, I should've thought more.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.783
I see. I understand.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.746
It's tails. You win, Ryota.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.373
Yes!

22:13.457 --> 22:15.334
I'm saved!

22:16.460 --> 22:22.674
Thank you, Ryota. Thanks to you,
I had a very fun time gambling.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.677
Sense of justice?

22:26.386 --> 22:29.347
It just makes me angrier
how wrong she was.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.725
There's only one reason.

22:32.350 --> 22:37.189
She doesn't see house pets as humans.
She sees them as a lower race.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.232
In other words...

22:39.941 --> 22:42.277
she insulted me.

22:43.445 --> 22:47.574
And that was a bad idea.
I'll make her regret it.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.085
- It's been forever!
- Thank you!

24:22.169 --> 24:24.504
The school started
to revolve around Yumeko.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.089
Of course, you're welcome!

24:26.173 --> 24:29.134
If that happens...
you'll form an idol unit with me.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.927
