WEBVTT

00:00.105 --> 00:04.672
A peace treaty has been ratified
with the Emperor of France.

00:04.829 --> 00:07.299
Who will now be our gallant ally.

00:07.505 --> 00:09.320
It'll come to war again.

00:09.622 --> 00:12.992
I am in love with Sonya
and I want us to be married.

00:12.993 --> 00:14.025
You had better know that

00:14.025 --> 00:16.989
I can never recognise that
intriguer as my daughter!

00:16.989 --> 00:18.989
My father made it a
condition of his consent

00:18.989 --> 00:20.928
that the marriage not
take place for a year.

00:20.929 --> 00:22.056
I'll wait.

00:22.057 --> 00:24.993
- You're so lovely.
- You mustn't say that!

00:24.993 --> 00:26.037
Why ever not?

00:27.065 --> 00:30.001
Will you tell Prince
Andrei when he comes

00:30.001 --> 00:31.985
that our engagement is at an end...

00:31.985 --> 00:33.061
and I cannot be his wife.

00:33.061 --> 00:35.073
He loves me, Sonya!

00:35.073 --> 00:38.029
I'd do anything...
I'd run away with him!

00:38.029 --> 00:40.029
You're to come with us, sir.

00:40.029 --> 00:42.005
We've been betrayed!

00:42.005 --> 00:43.053
No!

00:43.053 --> 00:45.057
I will go to him, wherever he is!

00:45.057 --> 00:47.997
He's a married man,
he has a wife in Poland!

01:55.989 --> 01:58.005
Andrei, I'm so sorry about this.

01:58.005 --> 02:00.029
Yes, well...

02:00.029 --> 02:04.009
Just to confirm, I have received
a refusal from Countess Rostova,

02:04.009 --> 02:05.037
and rumours have reached me

02:05.037 --> 02:06.349
about an intrigue with your

02:06.374 --> 02:08.000
brother-in-law. Is that correct?

02:08.001 --> 02:10.032
Yes, but that's all over.
Anatole has left Moscow.

02:10.032 --> 02:12.049
Well, it makes no difference.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.993
When you see Countess Rostova,

02:13.993 --> 02:16.013
tell her that she was
and is completely free,

02:16.013 --> 02:17.057
and I wish her no ill.

02:17.057 --> 02:18.997
Is that all?

02:20.021 --> 02:22.073
Look here, I'm sure it was
a moment of madness,

02:22.073 --> 02:25.021
and she regrets it bitterly.

02:25.021 --> 02:28.077
She loves you, I'm sure
of it, and you love her.

02:28.077 --> 02:30.029
Remember when you came to me

02:30.029 --> 02:33.001
and told me how madly
you were in love with her?

02:37.005 --> 02:40.013
I know you believe a fallen woman
should be forgiven, Pierre,

02:40.013 --> 02:42.029
and I admire you for it.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.077
But I'm a different sort of man.

02:44.077 --> 02:47.009
I cannot forgive, and I WILL not.

02:49.981 --> 02:51.981
Here are her letters,
and her portrait.

02:51.981 --> 02:54.033
I would be grateful if you
would return them to her.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.981
Andrei, think how
she must be suffering.

02:58.013 --> 02:59.993
Will you do as I ask?

03:02.065 --> 03:05.045
Yes, of course.

03:05.045 --> 03:06.985
Then take them.

03:07.989 --> 03:09.045
And if we are to remain friends,

03:09.045 --> 03:12.005
I ask you never to speak
to me about this again.

03:13.057 --> 03:14.985
Goodbye.

03:51.073 --> 03:54.001
You're not well.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.053
I wish I were dead.

03:55.053 --> 03:57.037
No...

03:57.037 --> 03:59.655
No, no, don't say that.

04:05.029 --> 04:06.077
What did he say?

04:08.069 --> 04:11.065
Only that you are free,
have always been free,

04:11.065 --> 04:13.613
and he bears you no ill will.

04:14.049 --> 04:16.000
Yes, that's like him.

04:18.069 --> 04:20.985
I know it's all over.

04:20.985 --> 04:24.464
And I'm tormented by the
wrong I've done him.

04:26.073 --> 04:28.013
But will you...?

04:34.029 --> 04:36.648
Will you ask him if he can forgive me?

04:37.981 --> 04:39.033
Of course I will.

04:39.033 --> 04:40.061
But, Natasha...

04:41.065 --> 04:44.073
What happened?
How did it come about?

04:44.073 --> 04:48.989
Did you...? Did you love that scoundrel?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.013
Don't call him that!

04:51.013 --> 04:52.065
I don't know.

04:52.065 --> 04:54.985
I don't know anything any more.

04:54.985 --> 04:56.025
I'm so unhappy.

04:57.985 --> 05:00.053
I've spoilt everything, haven't I?

05:02.029 --> 05:04.997
Don't try to talk about it now.

05:04.997 --> 05:08.025
Later, when your soul is clear,

05:08.025 --> 05:10.041
remember, I'm always your friend.

05:10.041 --> 05:14.981
If you need help, or advice,
or just to pour your soul out,

05:14.981 --> 05:17.033
remember me, dear Natasha.

05:17.033 --> 05:19.033
Don't talk to me like that.

05:20.037 --> 05:21.989
I don't deserve it.

05:23.009 --> 05:25.001
I'm ruined, aren't I?

05:25.001 --> 05:28.001
No... for God's sake, no. Listen.

05:28.001 --> 05:30.490
If I were not married myself,
and a better man than I am...

05:30.491 --> 05:32.985
I mean, worthy of you...

05:32.985 --> 05:35.045
I would go down on
my knees this minute

05:35.045 --> 05:37.997
and ask for your hand and your love.

05:41.037 --> 05:42.069
Oh...

05:44.005 --> 05:45.013
Pierre...

06:22.993 --> 06:24.592
Courage, mademoiselle.

06:26.989 --> 06:31.009
Oh, Ilya, when shall we
have our Natasha back?

06:31.009 --> 06:34.009
The doctor says she's making
good progress, physically.

06:34.009 --> 06:36.053
It's as if the spirit
were gone from her.

06:36.053 --> 06:39.045
She doesn't want to
read, or talk, or sing...

06:39.045 --> 06:42.009
Pierre seems to bring
her a little comfort.

06:42.009 --> 06:46.053
We should never have let her engage
herself to that cold-hearted man!

06:46.053 --> 06:49.065
To gain her affections and then
leave her alone for a year...

06:49.065 --> 06:52.017
almost as if he wanted
her to betray him!

06:56.073 --> 06:57.993
Oh, Ilya...

06:59.013 --> 07:01.005
... where's our lovely girl gone?

07:21.057 --> 07:24.001
Oh, God, in your mercy, forgive me,

07:24.001 --> 07:26.057
and show me the way
to lead a better life.

07:31.989 --> 07:35.981
Vive l'Empereur!
Vive l'Empereur!

07:39.138 --> 07:43.362
_

07:44.057 --> 07:46.989
Across the river, Russia.

07:49.021 --> 07:51.009
The time has come, gentlemen.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.057
Sound the advance.

07:59.061 --> 08:03.981
This breach of our treaty cannot
and will not be endured.

08:03.981 --> 08:05.025
Hear, hear!

08:05.025 --> 08:07.005
I will not make peace with that man

08:07.005 --> 08:10.077
unless he withdraws every one of
his soldiers from Russian soil!

08:13.045 --> 08:14.663
Drubetskoy.

08:16.045 --> 08:17.077
Come here.

08:22.061 --> 08:25.017
I appoint you to take
my message to Napoleon.

08:27.013 --> 08:30.001
I thank Your Majesty
for this great honour.

08:34.017 --> 08:36.044
Make sure he understands.

08:36.044 --> 08:40.013
Not one single French soldier
to remain on Russian soil.

08:40.013 --> 08:42.057
Now, go... and may God be with you.

09:07.017 --> 09:08.630
Wait here, sir.

09:22.009 --> 09:23.057
Monsieur Drubetskoy.

09:23.057 --> 09:26.308
- Sire, the Emperor...
- You are very young.

09:29.005 --> 09:31.013
I do not want war

09:31.013 --> 09:33.057
and I never wanted it.

09:33.057 --> 09:37.021
Your master has brought
it all upon himself.

09:37.021 --> 09:40.033
He could have had
Moldavia and Wallachia.

09:40.033 --> 09:42.013
Let him bear the consequences.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.997
Your generals have
no stomach for a fight.

09:45.997 --> 09:47.369
On... On the contrary,

09:47.394 --> 09:49.044
- Your Majesty...
- Don't argue with me.

09:49.045 --> 09:51.073
I know everything.

09:51.073 --> 09:54.989
I know the state of
your miserable army.

09:54.989 --> 09:57.069
You have 200,000 men.
I have three times that.

09:57.069 --> 10:00.005
Sire, if you are prepared
to withdraw your troops

10:00.005 --> 10:03.009
beyond the Neman, then
the Emperor will negotiate.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.989
C'est trop tard, mon petit.

10:07.989 --> 10:09.033
It's too late.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.025
I'm going to take your country.

10:11.025 --> 10:13.029
But it's all right.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.989
It's not your fault.

10:16.057 --> 10:19.025
Tell your master
he'll receive my letter.

10:24.073 --> 10:27.025
It's considered a great
honour, monsieur,

10:27.025 --> 10:29.993
to have one's ear pulled
by the Emperor.

10:31.025 --> 10:32.065
Oh, right...

10:32.065 --> 10:33.981
Thank you.

10:41.985 --> 10:45.017
Well, we're at war again.

10:45.017 --> 10:48.981
Napoleon's crossed the Neman and
he's advancing towards Smolensk.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.029
- Oh, Ilya!
- Don't fret, my dear,

10:51.029 --> 10:54.025
he'll be driven back before
he gets anywhere near Moscow.

10:54.025 --> 10:55.997
But Nikolai...

10:55.997 --> 10:58.009
Nikolai's a seasoned officer now.

10:58.009 --> 11:00.017
He knows how to look after himself.

11:00.017 --> 11:02.981
All we can do is hope and pray.

11:02.981 --> 11:05.049
- Papa, let me enlist!
- Absolutely not!

11:05.049 --> 11:07.069
I won't allow it... a boy of 15!

11:07.069 --> 11:10.073
All my friends are volunteering!

11:10.073 --> 11:14.057
If you won't find me a commission,
I'll run away and find one myself!

11:19.033 --> 11:22.029
It might be best to let him join up...

11:22.029 --> 11:23.275
- Ilya!
- ... find him a billet

11:23.300 --> 11:25.841
where he can look the part, but...

11:27.017 --> 11:28.648
... stay out of danger.

11:29.049 --> 11:31.009
Is anywhere safe now?

11:40.993 --> 11:43.057
Ah, Tikhon... it's good to see you.

11:43.057 --> 11:46.057
- How are things?
- All well, Your Excellency.

11:46.057 --> 11:49.049
Ah, we have been waiting
and waiting for your arrival!

11:49.049 --> 11:51.997
Do step in, Prince Andrei!

11:51.997 --> 11:53.049
Do I need your invitation?

11:53.049 --> 11:55.981
- No, of course...
- Are you mistress of this house now?

11:55.981 --> 11:57.049
No, not at all...

11:57.049 --> 12:00.021
Where are my father and
Princess Marya? And my son?

12:00.021 --> 12:02.025
Inside, waiting for you, Prince.

12:05.065 --> 12:06.993
Papa! Papa!

12:10.077 --> 12:12.997
How are you, Masha?

12:12.997 --> 12:15.057
So, you're going to war again?

12:15.057 --> 12:17.077
Run along.

12:17.077 --> 12:20.037
What else is there for me to do?

12:20.037 --> 12:22.021
The French grow closer by the day.

12:22.021 --> 12:23.985
I wish you could stay with us.

12:24.993 --> 12:27.997
Your little boy hardly knows you.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.753
Well, it can't be helped.

12:35.017 --> 12:38.033
I hope you're finding my son a
responsive pupil, Monsieur Dessales?

12:38.033 --> 12:40.049
Oh, yes. Of course,
he's still very young,

12:40.049 --> 12:43.017
but already I detect a certain
gift for la mathematique.

12:43.017 --> 12:46.009
Ah! Unlike his Aunt Marya, here!

12:47.061 --> 12:49.025
The hours I've wasted,

12:49.025 --> 12:51.989
trying to instil the principles
of algebra and geometry

12:51.989 --> 12:53.746
into that muddled little head!

12:53.868 --> 12:58.001
Ah, we ladies, the higher studies
are not for us, I think!

12:58.001 --> 13:00.049
We have a different kind
of wisdom, you know?

13:00.049 --> 13:03.041
And what might that be?

13:03.041 --> 13:06.049
If you don't know, Prince,
far be it for me to tell you!

13:10.061 --> 13:14.057
I see you were entertaining your
idiotic pilgrims again today, Marya.

13:14.057 --> 13:16.069
They're good people, Father.

13:16.069 --> 13:20.989
They know when they're onto a
good thing, I'll say that for them!

13:20.989 --> 13:22.985
How can anyone be so gullible?

13:26.809 --> 13:30.048
I know, I know. I see you looking at me.

13:30.049 --> 13:32.041
I should treat her more kindly.

13:32.041 --> 13:37.017
But she drives me to distraction
with her stupid religiosity...

13:37.017 --> 13:41.041
the way she moons about the
house with her eyes full of tears.

13:41.041 --> 13:44.021
What's she got to be mournful about?

13:44.021 --> 13:48.009
La Bourienne... now, she
makes the most of herself.

13:48.009 --> 13:50.017
She makes herself agreeable! Eh?

13:51.057 --> 13:53.057
If you're asking me...

13:53.057 --> 13:55.634
I wouldn't have said it,
but as you ask...

13:56.993 --> 13:59.025
I think you treat Marya abominably,

13:59.025 --> 14:02.061
when anyone can see how much
she loves you and respects you.

14:02.061 --> 14:04.057
And, again, if you ask me,

14:04.057 --> 14:07.049
I think that French woman
stirs things up between you.

14:07.049 --> 14:09.065
She should never have been
my sister's companion.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.005
She's not worthy.

14:12.057 --> 14:15.077
So, that's it! You had
to say it, didn't you?

14:15.077 --> 14:18.057
I didn't want to judge, but you did ask.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.077
And, Father, you know that I'm right.

14:22.005 --> 14:23.771
How DARE you?

14:24.981 --> 14:26.037
Get out!

14:26.037 --> 14:27.993
GET OUT!

14:27.993 --> 14:30.049
I don't want to see
your face any more!

14:45.997 --> 14:50.053
Once upon a time, there was
a very great nobleman

14:50.053 --> 14:52.719
and his name was Bluebeard.

14:54.001 --> 14:58.045
Now, this nobleman
had a beautiful young wife,

14:58.045 --> 15:00.041
but she died,

15:00.041 --> 15:04.017
and some people thought
that it was Bluebeard's fault,

15:04.017 --> 15:06.005
but didn't dare say so.

15:08.021 --> 15:11.065
And then, one day,
Bluebeard thought to himself,

15:11.065 --> 15:15.041
"It's about time I got myself
another beautiful, young wife..."

15:21.985 --> 15:23.732
Tell the story, Papa, tell it!

15:25.029 --> 15:27.061
Papa!

15:27.061 --> 15:29.065
Come here, I'll tell you the story.

15:29.065 --> 15:31.053
But I want Papa to tell it!

15:33.005 --> 15:35.017
Just come and say goodbye to him.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.989
I will not! Go away!

15:36.989 --> 15:40.001
But Andrei's leaving... Think!
You may never see him again!

15:40.001 --> 15:42.997
And whose fault is that?
You made me quarrel with him!

15:42.997 --> 15:44.053
I blame YOU for this!

16:20.017 --> 16:22.065
Andrei, I wish you didn't have to go.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.993
Thank God I can.

16:25.021 --> 16:28.017
- It's a shame that you can't.
- Why do you say that?

16:29.049 --> 16:31.061
When you're going
to that dreadful war

16:31.061 --> 16:33.061
and Papa's so old that he may not...

16:35.025 --> 16:37.025
Andrei, let me ask you one thing...

16:37.025 --> 16:39.073
don't go with bitterness in your heart.

16:41.073 --> 16:44.049
Only forgiveness
will make us truly happy.

16:44.049 --> 16:48.017
Forgiveness is a woman's
virtue. I'm not capable of it.

16:48.017 --> 16:52.069
When I see Anatole Kuragin again,
I shall challenge him and kill him.

16:52.069 --> 16:55.013
And then, perhaps, my
mind will be at peace.

17:24.981 --> 17:29.077
I wish you would play again
properly, and sing again.

17:29.077 --> 17:33.009
Sometimes I try, but it
feels wrong, you know?

17:33.009 --> 17:36.013
As if I've no voice left to sing with.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.001
It will come again.

17:38.001 --> 17:40.013
You've been very ill.
You know, it takes time.

17:41.029 --> 17:44.037
- What I did to Andrei...
- He should have forgiven you.

17:44.037 --> 17:46.077
To leave you alone for a year
for no good reason...

17:46.077 --> 17:49.077
and how could you have known
what sort of man Kuragin is?

17:49.077 --> 17:51.985
Natasha, you made one mistake,

17:51.985 --> 17:54.021
in a life that's all
been bringing happiness

17:54.021 --> 17:56.021
to everyone you know... one mistake!

17:57.037 --> 17:59.045
I mean, look at me.

17:59.045 --> 18:02.009
My life is one mistake after another.

18:02.009 --> 18:03.053
Is that how you see it?

18:03.053 --> 18:05.033
How could I see it otherwise?

18:05.033 --> 18:09.009
I wanted to change the world
for the better, help my fellow men

18:09.009 --> 18:12.049
and look at me... a fat,
drunken aristocrat

18:12.049 --> 18:14.077
who makes a bungle
out of everything.

18:14.077 --> 18:17.053
Natasha, I've done nothing
with my life, nothing!

18:17.053 --> 18:19.037
You've been very kind to me.

18:19.037 --> 18:21.077
And that's only because I...

18:21.077 --> 18:23.029
Never mind.

18:25.005 --> 18:26.985
No-one's as kind as you.

18:28.077 --> 18:31.808
No-one understands me
as well as you do.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.005
If you hadn't have been
there... then, and now...

18:35.005 --> 18:37.049
I don't know what would have
happened to me, because...

18:37.049 --> 18:39.001
If you knew how...

18:39.001 --> 18:40.053
No, this is wrong!

18:40.053 --> 18:42.001
What? What's wrong?

18:47.053 --> 18:48.997
Natasha, I think...

18:50.053 --> 18:53.029
I think it's best if
I don't visit you so often.

18:54.073 --> 18:56.021
But why?

18:58.077 --> 19:00.017
Because I...

19:02.045 --> 19:03.065
Tell me.

19:31.981 --> 19:34.013
First, get some stationery...
eight quires.

19:34.013 --> 19:38.001
Here's a sample, exactly the same,
get it from Minsky's, nowhere else...

19:38.001 --> 19:41.981
and varnish, sealing wax...
It's all on this list.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.009
Give my compliments to
the Governor of Smolensk...

19:44.009 --> 19:47.005
But, Papa, the French are
already approaching Smolensk!

19:47.005 --> 19:49.077
They're on our doorstep.
Didn't you read Andrei's letter?

19:49.077 --> 19:53.013
Nonsense, don't interfere!
Off you go, Tikhon! Off you go.

19:58.037 --> 19:59.981
Tikhon.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.881
Go to the Governor, tell him
my father refuses to leave,

20:03.041 --> 20:04.053
and ask him what can be done for us.

20:04.053 --> 20:07.001
For how many days will
we still be safe here?

20:07.001 --> 20:09.061
All right, Princess.
I'll see how the land lies.

20:09.061 --> 20:11.049
And come back quickly.

20:11.049 --> 20:12.712
Safe journey!

20:15.029 --> 20:17.057
No, no, no, she can't...

20:18.057 --> 20:21.041
The French can't be
near Smolensk already.

20:22.069 --> 20:24.694
No, no, no, no...

21:17.069 --> 21:19.053
The town is surrendered!

21:19.053 --> 21:20.638
Leave! Leave!

21:22.041 --> 21:24.005
Turn it round!

22:06.061 --> 22:08.073
Done for! Russia's done for!

22:08.073 --> 22:10.989
Go ahead, boys, take the lot!

22:10.989 --> 22:13.009
Leave nothing for the French!

22:13.009 --> 22:14.989
I'll set the fire myself.

22:23.057 --> 22:26.029
Tikhon! What in God's name
are you doing here?

22:26.029 --> 22:28.021
The master refused to leave, sir.

22:28.021 --> 22:29.069
Tell him he must!

22:29.069 --> 22:32.005
Tell him the French will be
at Bald Hills within days!

22:32.005 --> 22:35.029
Do you understand? He MUST
leave now, as must you!

22:35.029 --> 22:36.993
Yes, Your Excellency.

22:36.993 --> 22:38.029
Is everything lost now, then?

22:38.029 --> 22:40.049
Far from it. But, for
now, you have to go!

22:40.049 --> 22:41.981
GO!

22:54.005 --> 22:56.025
- No! No!
- But, Papa, Andrei said...

22:56.025 --> 22:59.041
Did he think I would abandon my
home to that accursed Frenchman?

22:59.041 --> 23:00.061
Never!

23:00.061 --> 23:02.981
Bald Hills must be defended,
to the last man!

23:02.981 --> 23:04.810
Summon the militia! Give me my jacket.

23:06.005 --> 23:08.049
Not that one! The full dress uniform!

23:08.049 --> 23:11.077
Papa, the militia aren't here
any more! Everyone's going!

23:11.077 --> 23:14.985
They would never dare disobey
me! You go, if you want to.

23:14.985 --> 23:16.065
I'm making my stand here!

23:16.065 --> 23:18.045
Tikhon, buckle my sword!

23:18.045 --> 23:19.989
Do it!

23:19.989 --> 23:21.037
Do it!

23:39.989 --> 23:42.021
Grandpa's going to war, isn't he?

23:51.013 --> 23:52.993
Quickly!

23:55.009 --> 23:56.057
Papa!

24:05.001 --> 24:07.069
We must carry him to Bogucharovo!

24:07.069 --> 24:10.053
We'll be safe there
for a while, at least.

24:18.045 --> 24:20.041
Carry on. I'm going to take a detour.

24:20.041 --> 24:23.017
There's a place ahead where the
men can bathe, if they want to.

24:23.017 --> 24:24.293
Very good, Your Excellency.

25:41.045 --> 25:43.061
Good day, Master.

25:43.061 --> 25:45.001
Where are the family?

25:45.001 --> 25:46.571
All gone away, sir.

25:49.053 --> 25:51.005
Thank God for that.

26:08.025 --> 26:11.041
It's all right, Your Excellency,
it's not too cold.

26:11.041 --> 26:13.065
If you fancy it, I
could order this lot out,

26:13.065 --> 26:16.057
- you could have it to yourself.
- No, no, let them bathe.

26:18.997 --> 26:20.993
So much healthy flesh.

26:22.603 --> 26:24.077
And all of it cannon fodder.

26:45.989 --> 26:48.065
May I be of any assistance,
Your Excellency?

26:48.065 --> 26:51.037
No, thank you. We're going to
our estate in Bogucharovo.

26:51.037 --> 26:53.065
- It's over there.
- I wouldn't advise it.

26:53.065 --> 26:55.981
The French are only
two days behind us.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.001
Go to Moscow. You'll be safe there.

27:40.045 --> 27:41.985
Dear heart...

27:45.017 --> 27:46.065
Daughter...

27:49.045 --> 27:50.993
My heart aches...

27:54.037 --> 27:56.037
Forgive me.

27:56.037 --> 27:58.017
Of course I forgive you, Papa.

28:02.077 --> 28:04.735
Andryushka...

28:06.981 --> 28:08.037
I want to see him.

28:12.005 --> 28:14.033
He can't come, Papa.

28:14.033 --> 28:16.025
He's away, with the Army.

28:19.009 --> 28:21.013
Russia lost...

28:23.057 --> 28:25.041
They destroyed her.

28:29.073 --> 28:31.005
Pu...

28:32.073 --> 28:34.001
Pu...

28:35.077 --> 28:37.017
What is it, dear?

28:39.009 --> 28:41.458
Put on your white dress.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.065
I like it.

29:30.041 --> 29:31.981
Tikhon...

29:35.997 --> 29:38.604
Tikhon, I wished for his death...

29:40.033 --> 29:43.029
I prayed for it, and all
the while, he loved me!

29:47.981 --> 29:49.033
He loved me...

30:28.033 --> 30:31.057
As soon as we've buried my father,
we must all leave for Moscow.

30:31.057 --> 30:33.989
Are you sure this is
the best? If we stayed,

30:33.989 --> 30:37.033
I am sure we would be very
well-treated by the French officers.

30:37.033 --> 30:40.009
I won't stay to see the
enemy in my father's house.

30:40.009 --> 30:42.049
- If you please, Your Excellency?
- Yes, what?

30:42.049 --> 30:44.989
The peasants are making
difficulties about the horses.

30:44.989 --> 30:48.057
You see? They know they, too, will
be well-treated by my countrymen.

30:48.057 --> 30:51.045
The French will put us
under their protection.

30:51.045 --> 30:52.507
Truly, Princess, it will be for

30:52.532 --> 30:54.017
- the best...
- I would rather die

30:54.017 --> 30:56.001
than beg my enemy to protect me.

30:56.001 --> 30:58.041
It would be an insult
to my father's memory.

30:58.041 --> 31:00.069
Tikhon, I am sure this must
be a misunderstanding...

31:00.069 --> 31:03.009
send Dron the Head Man
to me, please. Immediately.

31:03.009 --> 31:05.025
They're waiting outside,
Your Excellency.

31:23.013 --> 31:25.041
Dronushka, what is this?

31:25.041 --> 31:28.005
Now, after our misfortune?

31:28.005 --> 31:29.989
We all walk under God, Princess.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.049
I need to leave, this evening, or
tomorrow morning at the latest.

31:33.049 --> 31:36.057
Can you have the horses
ready and the carts loaded?

31:36.057 --> 31:38.069
There are no horses, Princess.

31:38.069 --> 31:41.053
Of course there are horses!
What are you talking about?

31:41.053 --> 31:43.045
It's God's punishment, Princess.

31:43.045 --> 31:46.009
Most of the horses were
taken for the Army,

31:46.009 --> 31:47.997
and, as for the rest of them,

31:47.997 --> 31:50.013
there's nothing left to feed them with.

31:50.013 --> 31:51.466
Lies!

31:51.466 --> 31:54.068
What it is, Your Excellency,
they've got it into their heads

31:54.069 --> 31:57.009
that they'd be better off
waiting for the French.

31:57.009 --> 31:58.065
You haven't understood.

31:58.065 --> 32:01.025
You have my word that
you will be housed and fed

32:01.025 --> 32:02.993
at our estate near Moscow.

32:02.993 --> 32:05.049
If you stay, the enemy will destroy you.

32:05.049 --> 32:07.989
The French will set us
free and give us land!

32:07.989 --> 32:09.057
What have you ever done for us?

32:09.057 --> 32:11.981
How can you say that?!

32:11.981 --> 32:15.037
You wouldn't dare to if my father
were alive or my brother were here.

32:15.037 --> 32:18.021
Now, I order you to have the
horses ready for departure!

32:32.077 --> 32:35.985
Beautiful country... we should
find plenty of fodder here.

32:35.985 --> 32:38.065
We need to secure it
before the French get to it.

32:38.065 --> 32:40.993
And a few pretty girls?

32:40.993 --> 32:43.029
Mine's the little one in front.

32:43.029 --> 32:46.029
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- What can we do for you, sweet-face?

32:46.029 --> 32:48.985
My mistress wishes to know
your name and your regiment,

32:48.985 --> 32:51.745
if you please, and if you would
come to the house and speak to her.

32:51.746 --> 32:55.009
Certainly. I'm Lieutenant Ilyin
of the Pavlograd Hussars

32:55.009 --> 32:57.041
and this is Count Rostov,
our squadron commander.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.450
And we will be delighted
to speak with your mistress...

32:59.451 --> 33:01.009
might we know her name?

33:01.009 --> 33:03.214
She is the Princess Marya Nikolayevna

33:03.239 --> 33:05.013
Bolkonskaya, Your Excellency.

33:05.013 --> 33:07.065
Her father, the Prince, died yesterday,

33:07.065 --> 33:10.985
and the peasants have been taking
advantage of the situation.

33:10.985 --> 33:13.591
I am sorry to hear of it.
Please show us the way.

33:24.049 --> 33:27.013
I am ashamed to have to beg
for your assistance, sir.

33:27.013 --> 33:29.073
Not at all, Princess.
This is an outrage,

33:29.073 --> 33:32.985
and I am only too happy
to be able to assist you.

33:32.985 --> 33:35.760
It will be both a pleasure and an
honour to escort you away from here

33:35.761 --> 33:38.985
and I promise you, no-one will
dare cause you any trouble.

33:45.049 --> 33:47.057
Thank you, Count Rostov.

34:21.009 --> 34:23.072
My dear Prince, can it be true?

34:23.072 --> 34:25.033
Smolensk in flames,

34:25.033 --> 34:28.013
and Napoleon advancing on Moscow?

34:28.013 --> 34:31.021
Oh, our army will stop him
well before Moscow,

34:31.021 --> 34:35.009
and you know, Moscow is
a long way from Petersburg.

34:35.009 --> 34:39.013
But if it comes to the worst,
what is to happen to us?

34:39.013 --> 34:41.016
Are we all to be guillotined?

34:41.016 --> 34:43.996
No, no, no, dear lady,
Napoleon is magnanimous.

34:43.996 --> 34:47.981
I suppose, we shall all have to
brush up our French again, though.

34:49.041 --> 34:52.053
Ah, Bilibin! Interesting
times we live in.

34:52.053 --> 34:54.077
The lovely Helene
not here this evening?

34:54.077 --> 34:58.013
Ah, no... she had to
accept another invitation.

35:06.033 --> 35:09.013
Two lovers, one absent husband,

35:09.013 --> 35:11.993
and she's in a delicate condition.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.065
Of course, the child
is not Bezukhov's.

35:18.029 --> 35:20.009
I'm sure she'll sort it out.

35:24.049 --> 35:25.997
Marry me...

35:27.037 --> 35:30.009
... and I'd be yours and yours alone.

35:30.009 --> 35:33.041
That's impossible... isn't it?

35:33.041 --> 35:36.005
- Aren't you still marriedto Bezukhov?
- No!

35:36.005 --> 35:37.993
Well, only in name.

35:39.005 --> 35:40.049
You see, we've...

35:41.057 --> 35:42.997
He's never...

35:44.985 --> 35:46.993
I can't say it in modesty...

35:46.993 --> 35:48.033
You're saying...

35:49.993 --> 35:51.061
... it could be annulled?

35:51.061 --> 35:53.069
Why not?

35:53.069 --> 35:56.985
I'm sure if I write to Pierre,
he'll do anything I asked.

35:56.985 --> 35:58.981
He's such an obliging soul.

36:03.037 --> 36:05.077
You do want to marry me, don't you?

36:05.077 --> 36:07.041
Well...

36:07.041 --> 36:09.025
Yes, of course!

36:12.993 --> 36:14.981
Then I'll write to Pierre directly.

36:26.041 --> 36:28.053
You're still wasting your time,

36:28.053 --> 36:30.981
turning over cards like a little boy?

36:30.981 --> 36:33.061
I'm trying to determine
my fate, Catiche.

36:33.061 --> 36:36.013
Someone told me that you
were going to the war.

36:36.013 --> 36:38.021
Yes, I'm considering it.

36:38.021 --> 36:39.985
You?

36:39.985 --> 36:41.989
You know nothing about war.

36:46.001 --> 36:48.025
Then perhaps it's time I found out.

36:54.025 --> 36:56.029
'My dear mother and father,

36:56.029 --> 36:59.005
'I hope you are making
plans to leave Moscow.

36:59.005 --> 37:01.997
'Otradnoye will be
much safer for you.

37:01.997 --> 37:06.009
'As for myself, you will be happy
to hear that I am well and safe.

37:06.009 --> 37:08.989
'The Pavlograd Hussars
have been held in reserve,

37:08.989 --> 37:12.021
'so I have been buying
new horses for the regiment.

37:12.021 --> 37:14.985
'We're in a beautiful
part of the country.

37:14.985 --> 37:18.049
'No-one would think
that we were at war.'

37:18.049 --> 37:20.997
"A short time ago, I was
able to be of service

37:20.997 --> 37:24.997
- "to Princess Marya Bolkonskaya..."
- Ah!

37:24.997 --> 37:27.461
"The family estate was in
the path of the French advance,

37:27.461 --> 37:29.068
"and as I happened
to be in the area,

37:29.069 --> 37:32.053
"I was happy to escort the
Princess for part of her journey

37:32.053 --> 37:34.069
"to a place of greater safety.

37:34.069 --> 37:37.989
"She was very grateful,
as you can imagine..."

37:37.989 --> 37:40.053
There's a bit crossed
out there, can't read it.

37:40.053 --> 37:45.053
"... and asked me to send her
warmest good wishes to you all."

37:45.053 --> 37:46.073
Well!

37:46.073 --> 37:48.057
If something should come of that,

37:48.057 --> 37:50.037
it could solve all our problems.

37:50.037 --> 37:53.053
'I will soon be arriving in Voronezh,
where I have been invited

37:53.053 --> 37:56.017
'to spend the evening with
the Governor and his wife.

37:56.017 --> 37:58.053
'I understand they're
old friends of yours,

37:58.053 --> 38:01.049
'so I am very much looking
forward to meeting them.'

38:03.049 --> 38:06.045
Ah, here they are,
the men of the moment!

38:06.045 --> 38:09.033
You are welcome, gentlemen!
Please... take a drink.

38:09.033 --> 38:10.053
Thank you.

38:16.037 --> 38:18.686
Rich pickings.

38:20.997 --> 38:23.077
It is such a pleasure
to meet you at last.

38:23.077 --> 38:25.053
A pleasure for me, too.

38:25.053 --> 38:28.057
We heard of your rescue
of Princess Marya.

38:28.057 --> 38:31.053
Ah! Well, it was fortunate
that I was passing.

38:31.053 --> 38:34.029
You made a great impression
upon the Princess.

38:34.029 --> 38:35.937
Did you know that she's here in

38:35.962 --> 38:38.028
- Voronezh, with her aunt?
- Really?

38:38.029 --> 38:40.025
Yes, she is.

38:40.025 --> 38:43.001
And, of course, you will call
upon her tomorrow morning,

38:43.001 --> 38:44.985
to pay your respects.

38:44.985 --> 38:47.005
I should be very pleased
to see her again.

38:47.005 --> 38:49.001
You know, it's just the match for you.

38:49.001 --> 38:51.045
Would you like me to arrange it?

38:51.045 --> 38:52.993
If only it were that simple.

39:01.033 --> 39:02.061
He's here!

39:18.057 --> 39:20.045
Count Rostov.

39:22.041 --> 39:24.005
Princess.

39:24.005 --> 39:27.013
I was so happy to hear
you were in Voronezh.

39:27.013 --> 39:29.101
It really does seem
like fate, doesn't it?

39:29.126 --> 39:31.005
Yes, it does.

39:31.981 --> 39:33.687
I hope your family are well.

39:33.688 --> 39:36.069
Yes, very well... that is to say,
my sister was quite ill,

39:36.069 --> 39:38.049
but I believe she's recovering now.

39:38.049 --> 39:39.989
Oh, I hope so.

39:39.989 --> 39:42.009
I liked her very much
when I met her,

39:42.009 --> 39:43.985
and I hope to see more of her.

39:43.985 --> 39:45.025
I hope you do.

39:47.985 --> 39:50.993
Strange how things turn
out sometimes, isn't it?

39:52.069 --> 39:54.013
Yes, it is.

40:26.013 --> 40:27.724
Ah, Prince Andrei!

40:29.001 --> 40:30.037
Welcome back, Your Grace.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.849
I'm delighted to be under

40:32.874 --> 40:35.064
- your command again.
- Good lad!

40:35.065 --> 40:38.037
I'm very glad to see you.

40:38.037 --> 40:39.672
How is your father?

40:41.017 --> 40:43.061
I learned of his death
only yesterday.

40:43.061 --> 40:46.069
Oh! I'm so, so sorry to hear that.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.637
I loved and respected him.

40:50.001 --> 40:52.009
He was a great soldier in his day.

40:55.013 --> 40:56.053
Well, well.

40:58.013 --> 41:00.566
So, you'll be at my side on the day?

41:01.049 --> 41:04.005
I thank you for the honour,
but I request permission

41:04.005 --> 41:06.462
to be allowed to fight on the
front line with my regiment.

41:06.463 --> 41:08.029
It'll be bloody.

41:08.029 --> 41:10.009
But you don't need
me to tell you that.

41:11.053 --> 41:14.981
I expect to lose 200,000 men.

41:14.981 --> 41:17.045
God-willing, he'll lose more.

41:17.045 --> 41:19.057
He thinks he's invincible.

41:19.057 --> 41:21.017
He'll find he's not.

41:22.069 --> 41:24.989
We're fighting on our own soil now.

41:25.989 --> 41:29.825
We can't give him a clear run
to Moscow, not without a fight.

41:30.077 --> 41:31.981
So...

41:33.069 --> 41:35.005
... it has to be here.

41:36.069 --> 41:38.065
We'll stop him here...

41:38.065 --> 41:40.029
at Borodino.

41:41.049 --> 41:42.985
Good.

41:44.065 --> 41:45.985
Good luck, my boy.

41:47.041 --> 41:48.989
I hope we meet again.

42:12.993 --> 42:15.069
Excuse me, sir...
what's this place called?

42:15.069 --> 42:17.077
Bordino... No, Borodino.

42:17.077 --> 42:19.041
And are all these ours?

42:19.041 --> 42:21.989
That's right... and
over there, the French.

42:21.989 --> 42:24.981
Look! There. You can
see their fires on the hill.

42:24.981 --> 42:27.728
And you are, sir? What, a doctor?

42:28.041 --> 42:29.077
No, no...

42:29.077 --> 42:33.005
Um... I'm just here
to see what's going on.

43:22.001 --> 43:23.029
Count Bezukhov!

43:24.069 --> 43:26.017
Dolokhov.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.659
I am so glad I saw you, old friend.

43:34.985 --> 43:38.029
God knows whether either of us
will be alive after tomorrow.

43:39.989 --> 43:41.989
I am very sorry we fell out.

43:42.993 --> 43:44.985
I wronged you, Petrushka,

43:44.985 --> 43:46.507
and I beg your forgiveness.

44:13.017 --> 44:15.005
Who is that fool?

44:15.005 --> 44:17.037
- Hey, watch yourself!
- I do beg your pardon.

44:17.037 --> 44:19.049
I'm looking for Prince Bolkonsky.

44:19.049 --> 44:20.989
He's that way.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.001
Pierre?

44:28.005 --> 44:29.463
What in hell's name
are you doing here?

44:29.488 --> 44:31.024
Looking for you!

44:31.025 --> 44:33.981
And I thought I would see if
there was anything I could do,

44:33.981 --> 44:35.985
for Russia and so on...

44:35.985 --> 44:37.049
For God's sake, Pierre...

44:37.049 --> 44:39.985
we're about to fight
the bloodiest battle yet...

44:39.985 --> 44:41.605
I have to look after you now?

44:43.009 --> 44:46.069
You just turn around
and go straight home,

44:46.069 --> 44:49.985
- while you still have the chance...
- No, no! I'm here now.

44:49.985 --> 44:53.005
It's all right... I promise
I won't get in your way.

44:56.073 --> 44:58.005
Very well.

44:59.985 --> 45:01.033
Come on, then.

45:09.077 --> 45:11.709
So, you think we'll win tomorrow?

45:12.077 --> 45:14.993
I think we'll hold them to a standstill,

45:14.993 --> 45:16.053
which is as good as winning.

45:16.053 --> 45:18.021
I sense it in our men.

45:18.021 --> 45:21.021
They're ready to die this
time, they won't run away.

45:23.073 --> 45:24.997
It won't be pretty.

45:26.057 --> 45:29.001
Really, you should go back to Moscow.

45:29.001 --> 45:32.061
No, no, not now I've come all this way.

45:32.061 --> 45:34.069
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

45:34.069 --> 45:36.596
- You're not afraid?
- No!

45:38.033 --> 45:41.021
No, why should I be?
If death comes, it comes.

45:42.985 --> 45:45.009
What do I have to lose?

45:45.009 --> 45:47.049
I feel very much the
same, my friend.

45:49.997 --> 45:52.005
I spoke to Natasha
just before I came here.

45:52.005 --> 45:54.985
She still loves you, Andrei,
and she longs for your forgiveness.

45:54.985 --> 45:56.029
That's all over now,

45:56.029 --> 45:58.053
and I thought we'd agreed
we'd never speak of it.

46:14.001 --> 46:16.029
I went back to Bald Hills.

46:16.029 --> 46:18.997
I was walking through the orchard.

46:18.997 --> 46:22.077
There were a couple of
peasant girls there, very young,

46:22.077 --> 46:25.065
picking the plums and eating them.

46:25.065 --> 46:28.057
They thought they were
doing something naughty.

46:28.057 --> 46:31.532
When they saw me,
they ran away laughing.

46:32.077 --> 46:35.049
I wanted to tell them, "It's all
right... take as many as you like."

46:38.013 --> 46:41.005
They were picking up their
skirts as they ran away.

46:41.005 --> 46:43.553
I could see their little feet...

46:44.061 --> 46:45.993
... flashing white.

46:53.073 --> 46:55.053
It was her soul I loved.

46:57.001 --> 46:58.768
Was it all an illusion?

47:05.017 --> 47:06.069
You know, one time,

47:06.069 --> 47:11.053
she was trying to tell me about
some old man she met in the forest,

47:11.053 --> 47:13.807
who'd been very kind to her.

47:14.053 --> 47:17.057
She was trying to find
the right words to tell it...

47:17.057 --> 47:19.680
how special the moment had been.

47:21.997 --> 47:24.997
She couldn't find the words,
but it didn't matter.

47:26.989 --> 47:28.562
It was in her eyes, Pierre.

47:28.739 --> 47:30.073
I know.

47:30.073 --> 47:32.077
- It was her soul I loved...
- I know.

47:32.077 --> 47:34.029
... and that animal, Kuragin...

47:35.049 --> 47:38.021
... all he saw in her was a piece
of sweet flesh to feed on.

47:39.029 --> 47:41.025
Well, it's all over
and done with, now.

47:41.025 --> 47:44.045
- No, it doesn't have to be.
- Enough. Time to sleep.

47:44.045 --> 47:46.053
You need to be fresh
in the morning and so do I.

47:46.053 --> 47:48.005
- Andrei...
- Enough!

48:01.041 --> 48:02.077
Warriors!

48:04.005 --> 48:07.049
Here, at last, is the
battle you longed for!

48:07.049 --> 48:11.985
Act as you acted at Austerlitz
and victory is assured!

48:13.069 --> 48:15.985
"Posterity will remember you

48:15.985 --> 48:18.069
"as the heroes who fought and won

48:18.069 --> 48:21.033
"in the great battle of Borodino!"

48:21.033 --> 48:24.017
Vive l'Empereur!

48:24.017 --> 48:25.061
What?

48:27.021 --> 48:29.989
- What's happened? Has it begun?
- Yes, if you please.

48:29.989 --> 48:32.811
My master left a horse for you...
all the gentlemen have gone,

48:32.935 --> 48:34.073
and General Kutuzov
left an hour ago.

48:34.073 --> 48:36.013
Why didn't you wake me?

48:36.013 --> 48:38.993
My master said to let
you sleep, Your Excellency.

48:43.041 --> 48:44.073
Excuse me...

48:44.073 --> 48:46.001
I beg your pardon.

48:50.061 --> 48:52.013
Excuse me, excuse me...

48:52.013 --> 48:53.029
I beg your pardon.

49:18.981 --> 49:20.009
Who's that?

49:20.009 --> 49:21.049
You, sir!

49:22.077 --> 49:25.017
Count Bezukhov, at your
service, Your Grace.

49:25.017 --> 49:28.057
Anything I can do to help... I should
like to get in the thick of it!

49:28.057 --> 49:30.867
Oh! Would you now?

49:32.005 --> 49:34.582
All right, show him the way.

49:36.993 --> 49:38.997
God be with you, my boy.

49:38.997 --> 49:40.021
Follow me.

50:02.053 --> 50:05.989
Sir, you shouldn't be here...
it's too dangerous!

50:05.989 --> 50:08.001
It's all right. I won't get in the way.

50:08.001 --> 50:10.053
Let me know if there's
anything I can do.

50:13.073 --> 50:16.033
Are you not scared, Master?

50:16.033 --> 50:17.916
No, I don't seem to be... are you?

50:18.053 --> 50:19.996
When you could have your guts
spilled at any minute?

50:19.997 --> 50:21.045
Of course I'm scared!

50:49.045 --> 50:52.025
- We're getting cut to pieces!
- Nothing to do but endure.

50:55.017 --> 50:57.029
Courage, lads!

51:10.017 --> 51:14.985
Colonel, it is my duty to report...
only eight charges left.

51:14.985 --> 51:16.033
Do we continue firing?

51:16.033 --> 51:18.001
Yes, of course.

51:18.001 --> 51:20.053
You - run to the ammunition 
cart, get the reserves!

51:20.053 --> 51:21.993
I'll go! I'm strong.

51:21.993 --> 51:24.073
- This is no place for you, Master.
- No, no, I'll help you carry them.

51:41.005 --> 51:42.849
Here they are, Master!

52:53.041 --> 52:56.025
Sir, the ammunition
boxes got blown up!

53:02.017 --> 53:04.045
Help me, brother! Help me!

53:36.997 --> 53:39.029
Sire, Marshal Murat's compliments.

53:39.029 --> 53:41.037
Reinforcements are necessary!

53:41.037 --> 53:43.073
Reinforcements?
We're only two to one!

53:43.073 --> 53:47.025
Marshal Murat says one more 
division would finish the job.

53:47.025 --> 53:51.009
Sire, the Russians are attacking
our left flank! We can't hold them!

53:51.009 --> 53:53.049
- Sire... the Imperial Guard? 
- No.

53:53.049 --> 53:56.053
I'm not going to risk losing
the Imperial Guard in this shambles.

53:56.053 --> 53:58.069
Order the army to
withdraw and regroup.

53:58.069 --> 54:01.033
Meanwhile, keep up
with the bombardment.

54:01.033 --> 54:03.069
There's more than
one way to skin a cat.

54:15.045 --> 54:16.069
Look at that dog!

54:18.001 --> 54:20.001
The things you see in a war.

54:20.001 --> 54:21.073
Look out!

54:23.013 --> 54:24.989
Get down, sir!

54:25.065 --> 54:26.989
Get down, sir!

54:26.989 --> 54:28.005
Get down!

55:02.989 --> 55:04.073
All right, Your Excellency.

55:04.073 --> 55:07.021
It's a bad one, but we'll do our best.

55:19.069 --> 55:21.053
Show it to me...

55:21.053 --> 55:23.017
There you are, sir.

55:26.073 --> 55:28.009
Anatole?

55:28.009 --> 55:29.065
Anatole.

55:29.065 --> 55:31.005
Kuragin.

55:31.005 --> 55:32.989
Bolkonsky.

55:32.989 --> 55:35.592
Bolkonsky, have pity.

55:36.065 --> 55:38.017
Look what they've done to me!

56:54.077 --> 56:57.001
Gentlemen, we have 
endured everything

56:57.001 --> 56:59.766
the enemy could throw at us
and have driven them off.

57:01.001 --> 57:05.041
Napoleon has suffered a mortal 
wound from which he will not recover.

57:05.041 --> 57:09.001
The spirit of his army has been broken.

57:09.001 --> 57:10.033
And now?

57:11.061 --> 57:12.993
Do we go on the offensive?

57:15.037 --> 57:17.049
No.

57:17.049 --> 57:18.989
We retreat.

57:19.993 --> 57:22.065
We lost half our army at Borodino.

57:22.065 --> 57:24.993
Let us not lose the other half.

57:24.993 --> 57:26.057
Abandon Moscow?

57:27.073 --> 57:30.576
Abandon Russia's sacred 
capital without a fight?
