WEBVTT

02:05.335 --> 02:07.504
You look like you're doing all right.

02:09.881 --> 02:12.675
Father Time has his way with us all.

02:13.885 --> 02:15.887
Looks like you must have pissed him off.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.106
Why we here?

02:29.025 --> 02:32.821
All right. You know that thing
the State PD is asking about,

02:32.904 --> 02:35.073
the Lake Charles murder.

02:36.157 --> 02:39.869
Shouldn't that have been in the papers
or online somewhere by now?

02:41.120 --> 02:43.498
I mean, we can't trust them.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.750
I mean, if they go cover
something like that up,

02:45.834 --> 02:47.752
who knows what else they've covered up.

02:48.503 --> 02:49.921
What you think?

02:51.673 --> 02:56.094
I think you don't look particularly healthy,
listening to you talk.

02:56.511 --> 03:00.765
Your eyes, you seem kind of brittle, Rust.

03:01.599 --> 03:05.186
Most of the last decade I spent stone drunk.

03:05.645 --> 03:08.064
Functional, but hammered.

03:08.982 --> 03:13.486
Went back to Alaska.
Spent eight years working fishing boats, bars.

03:13.653 --> 03:15.572
I thought you didn't like the cold.

03:15.655 --> 03:17.073
I hate it.

03:17.156 --> 03:20.410
And then I come back here to Louisiana
for the first time in 2010.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.120
And why is that?

03:22.412 --> 03:25.790
The same reason I'm sitting
across the table from you now.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.210
A man remembers his debts.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.464
I don't dwell in the past.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.884
Well, it must be nice.

03:35.967 --> 03:39.178
I'm not interested in whatever
it is you think you owe me.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.847
Well, I don't owe you.

03:40.930 --> 03:44.017
We left something undone.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.519
We got to fix it.

03:46.603 --> 03:49.856
I've been working on this for two years.
Me. Myself.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.900
I never called you.
I never bothered you with it.

03:51.983 --> 03:53.234
Yeah, why would you?

03:53.318 --> 03:56.905
Shit, man! What, did you alienate
every other person in your life

03:56.988 --> 03:59.240
and then finally you came back
to me in the rotation?

03:59.324 --> 04:00.283
You know, not for nothing,

04:00.366 --> 04:02.368
but if you hadn't clipped Ledoux back then,

04:02.452 --> 04:04.871
we might have got the whole fucking story
out of him.

04:06.497 --> 04:10.043
You know, I think I'm going to finish this beer
and say so long.

04:10.126 --> 04:12.128
I'm not much of a drinker nowadays.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.173
In fact, I hadn't had a drop in three weeks
till I ran into you.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.258
I don't need you to drink, Marty.

04:17.342 --> 04:19.385
- I need you to help me.
- Why would I?

04:19.844 --> 04:21.888
They say you can't account for your time.

04:21.971 --> 04:26.100
They got eyewitnesses placing you
at the Lake Charles crime scene.

04:26.184 --> 04:28.978
You got some storage shed
that you won't let 'em look at.

04:29.062 --> 04:30.438
- That's right.
- Why not?

04:30.521 --> 04:33.024
Why not shoot straight with them?
You're innocent.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.776
Help them stop wasting their time.

04:34.859 --> 04:38.154
Fucking since when did guilt
and innocence define the State PD?

04:38.696 --> 04:40.323
Come the fuck on!

04:40.406 --> 04:42.283
I don't know the sprawl of this thing,
all right?

04:42.367 --> 04:46.537
The people I'm after, they're all fucking over.
They're in a lot of different things.

04:46.621 --> 04:48.623
Pieces. Family trees.

04:49.540 --> 04:53.127
The only way for you to understand
what I'm onto here is for me to show you.

04:53.211 --> 04:55.296
You got to come see what I got.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.465
No. You know what?

04:57.548 --> 05:00.259
I don't think I've been
very clear with you, Rust.

05:00.343 --> 05:04.055
If you were drowning,
I'd throw you a fucking barbell.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.809
Why would I ever help you?

05:14.023 --> 05:16.484
Because you have a debt.

05:26.244 --> 05:28.246
You got some fucking sack.

05:28.538 --> 05:31.165
What's that mean, I have a debt?

05:31.249 --> 05:34.585
Means the way shit went down in '95,

05:34.669 --> 05:36.754
this is on you, too, buddy.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.473
What do you got to show me?

07:03.007 --> 07:04.550
What you packing?

07:08.221 --> 07:09.847
.38.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.725
Hollow-point?

07:13.101 --> 07:14.560
Yeah.

07:14.644 --> 07:16.187
That'll do it.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.698
You can never be too careful.

07:44.298 --> 07:48.052
All right, remember
there was no physical evidence

07:48.219 --> 07:52.140
connecting Dora Lange to
Ledoux's place out in the woods.

07:52.223 --> 07:56.644
Meaning it probably didn't happen out there.
Nobody was in a hurry to bring that up.

07:56.727 --> 08:00.398
Two. Women and children going missing.

08:00.481 --> 08:04.110
All taken from areas within
a 10-mile radius of schools

08:04.193 --> 08:06.988
that were funded by
Tuttle's Wellspring initiative.

08:07.071 --> 08:10.575
We establish a connection,
who's in, who's out, you know?

08:10.658 --> 08:14.245
I mean, do people disappear in equal numbers
in other parts of the state?

08:14.370 --> 08:17.165
- How many schools were there?
- Fourteen.

08:17.248 --> 08:19.500
Now, I've covered a surface area.

08:19.584 --> 08:22.712
I pulled runaways in state
and missing persons.

08:22.795 --> 08:26.424
Now, if you'll notice, there's twice as many
along the bayous. I don't know why.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.759
Hell, someone should do a study as to why.

08:29.427 --> 08:31.262
Now you're just throwing up stats.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.348
Why was Tuttle so interested
in the Lange case?

08:34.515 --> 08:37.685
Remember Charlie Lange
said what Ledoux told him?

08:37.768 --> 08:40.188
He said there's a group of men, sacrifices.

08:40.271 --> 08:42.773
Well, I think Tuttle recognized the scene.

08:42.857 --> 08:45.860
That's why he came down there
jiminy quick with a fucking taskforce,

08:45.943 --> 08:48.321
and that's why he tripped out
when I talked to him in '02.

08:48.404 --> 08:50.198
Okay, so what happened to him?

08:50.990 --> 08:55.870
I mean, I'm looking around here
and I don't see or hear anything

08:55.953 --> 08:57.872
that doesn't make this all conjectural.

08:59.123 --> 09:01.083
1988.

09:01.209 --> 09:06.464
Accusations of child molestation
at a preschool funded by Tuttle.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.133
The name of that school
was Shepherd's Flock.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.720
It shuts down, reopens two years
later on Pelican Island

09:12.803 --> 09:17.308
under the name Light of the Way Academy,
where Rianne Olivier went.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.561
Now, I got an enrollment list.
Sixteen kids in the class.

09:20.645 --> 09:22.355
One of them turned out to be a young man

09:22.438 --> 09:25.233
who just showed up
for solicitation in New Orleans.

09:30.988 --> 09:35.576
<i>Now this is 2010.
His name is Toby Boelert.</i>

09:35.952 --> 09:38.079
<i>Goes by the name of Johnny Joanie.</i>

09:47.338 --> 09:49.173
Shepherd's Flock.

09:50.508 --> 09:53.261
Why are you asking me about that place?

09:53.344 --> 09:57.473
After that place shut down,
there was a lot of talk going around...

09:58.766 --> 10:00.518
You ever see that reverend,

10:01.477 --> 10:03.020
Billy Lee Tuttle, around?

10:03.104 --> 10:06.482
You know, I think so.
But who can remember way back?

10:07.108 --> 10:08.818
That's how it all started.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.529
Memory be fucked.

10:12.655 --> 10:16.659
I decided it all had to be a dream anyways.
And I don't remember if...

10:20.037 --> 10:21.414
We'd go to sleep.

10:22.873 --> 10:26.127
Only sometimes I didn't feel like I was asleep.
I felt like I was still awake.

10:26.210 --> 10:29.130
But I must have been asleep
because I couldn't move.

10:29.672 --> 10:33.551
Just sort of see under my eyelids.

10:34.510 --> 10:35.970
Then what?

10:36.762 --> 10:38.472
I don't know.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.057
There were men,

10:41.559 --> 10:43.602
taking pictures.

10:44.395 --> 10:48.024
Sometimes other things.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.736
- Who were they?
- I don't know.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.071
They had animal faces.

10:54.155 --> 10:56.907
That's why I decided it had to be a dream.

10:56.991 --> 11:00.244
They had animal faces.
Well, it had to be a dream.

11:00.328 --> 11:02.621
Any other kids see this?

11:02.705 --> 11:03.706
One girl.

11:05.041 --> 11:09.170
I don't remember her name.
She first started talking about it.

11:09.253 --> 11:11.630
She seen it, too, the faces.

11:11.714 --> 11:15.009
- I do not remember her name.
- Marie Fontenot.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.304
Maybe.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.390
You ever see any of these men's faces?

11:21.474 --> 11:24.727
Once. They didn't all have animal faces.

11:26.937 --> 11:31.150
Three younger men. I don't remember them.
Just one.

11:31.817 --> 11:34.195
He had bad scars all around his mouth.

11:34.278 --> 11:37.198
Like the bottom half got all burned up.

11:39.158 --> 11:41.035
And you know what?

11:41.118 --> 11:43.996
I thought that meant it was a dream, too.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.877
No, I don't think it was a dream.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.088
<i>I don't understand.</i>

11:52.171 --> 11:56.384
Are you saying that you think
that this hypothetical killer

11:56.467 --> 11:59.136
was an old school teacher?

11:59.220 --> 12:02.681
Or it might, what, involve State PD?

12:02.765 --> 12:05.393
Goddamn, what happened to you, man?

12:06.435 --> 12:08.854
You remember him?

12:09.688 --> 12:11.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.734
You and I are on the case in Erath.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.445
A girl comes forward and says
she was chased through the woods

12:16.529 --> 12:18.656
by a spaghetti monster with green ears.

12:18.739 --> 12:23.702
Now I think that this is our man
with the scars on his face.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.454
I've got three references.

12:25.538 --> 12:30.042
Seventeen years ago, that old revival church
said a tall man with scars came through.

12:30.126 --> 12:35.131
Kelly Reider, in the hospital.
And, now, this hooker from the Quarter, Toby.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.924
I don't know who he is.
I don't know where he is.

12:37.007 --> 12:40.719
I don't know where this thing fucking starts,
but it ends with him.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.849
All right, you know that little township
down around Erath?

12:44.932 --> 12:48.102
All right?
That's where the Tuttle family is from.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.855
Now, it used to be a pirate hideout.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.482
Now they turned it
into plantations or whatnot.

12:53.566 --> 12:56.152
Had a very rural sense of Mardi Gras.

12:57.319 --> 13:00.030
You know, the men on horses,
animal masks, and such.

13:00.114 --> 13:02.825
- Courir de Mardi Gras.
- That's right.

13:02.908 --> 13:07.121
Now, they had an annual winter festival,
all right, heavy on the Saturnalia.

13:07.204 --> 13:10.791
A place where that Santeria
and Voudon all mashed together.

13:10.875 --> 13:11.876
Have a look.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.878
From the winter festival.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.547
Blindfold.

13:17.423 --> 13:19.425
Antlers. Mask.

13:21.469 --> 13:26.599
I got these from a series an artist
did in Kenner, right after Katrina.

13:26.682 --> 13:31.270
Says he kept running across these
"stick things" as he called them.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.855
Look familiar?

13:34.064 --> 13:37.109
I think our man had a real good time
after the hurricane.

13:37.610 --> 13:40.863
Chaos. People missing. People gone.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.281
Cops gone.

13:43.282 --> 13:45.409
I think he had a real good year.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.912
What do you need me for?

13:48.954 --> 13:53.918
You got friends on the force.
You have access that I don't. Databases.

13:54.084 --> 13:57.588
I need case files. I need missing persons.
I need homicides.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.341
I need title transfers, auto and home.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.177
I got a list of names. I'm gonna need
background checks, tax records.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.970
Anything we can get on Ledoux.

14:05.054 --> 14:06.388
Jesus Christ, man.

14:06.472 --> 14:09.350
I wouldn't have called you
and I wouldn't have fucking bothered you

14:09.433 --> 14:12.061
if State wouldn't have pulled me in
on this Lake Charles case.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.646
Well, if you need help,

14:13.729 --> 14:16.440
why don't you just give it
to Papania and Gilbough?

14:16.524 --> 14:19.068
No, they may be pawns in this thing
and not even fucking know it.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.653
- Come on.
- Look, Eddie Tuttle

14:20.736 --> 14:22.863
is the goddamn senator of this state.

14:22.947 --> 14:25.741
The late Reverend Billy Lee Tuttle
is his cousin.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.785
I'm telling you, it's a fucking family thing.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.371
That's what I mean
when I talk about the sprawl, Marty.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.582
Eddie Tuttle is the reason that
the Lake Charles thing never made the wire.

14:33.666 --> 14:36.377
Look, man, you have
some compelling stuff here.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.295
And you might have something.

14:41.257 --> 14:46.845
But all this "sprawl," as you call it,
which I would call "conjecture,"

14:46.971 --> 14:49.598
this shit about the Tuttles and the State PD,

14:49.682 --> 14:53.561
do you know how fucking crazy that sounds?

14:53.644 --> 14:55.938
It's like you've been alone too long.

14:56.021 --> 15:02.236
Like you, maybe, told yourself this story
and kept drinking until you believed it.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.571
Marty.

15:07.157 --> 15:10.828
I had my time where I wondered
if this was all in my head.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.206
That time passed.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.500
Really?

15:21.505 --> 15:24.383
What happened to Billy Lee Tuttle?

15:27.761 --> 15:30.681
There's something
you're going to have to look at.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.183
No other way around it.

15:38.314 --> 15:39.732
<i>You still take your coffee black?</i>

15:40.691 --> 15:42.943
Green tea,
if you have it.

15:43.027 --> 15:45.779
I've been trying to stay away
from coffee, you know,

15:45.863 --> 15:47.656
a little bit healthier.

15:47.740 --> 15:51.368
So, Mace, is she back from Chicago yet?

15:51.577 --> 15:54.705
- Three months ago.
- Three months?

15:57.249 --> 15:59.793
- What was that? That...
- AmeriCorps.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.588
Teaching.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.548
And Audrey, how is she?

16:04.632 --> 16:07.134
She's fine at the moment.

16:07.217 --> 16:10.554
She sometimes decides
she doesn't need her meds.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.558
I like her boyfriend. He watches out for her.

16:14.642 --> 16:17.478
She had an art show in New Orleans.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.937
Sold some paintings.

16:19.021 --> 16:24.777
Well, that's good. That's great.
I should buy one, I mean, if I can afford it.

16:29.865 --> 16:32.284
So the reason I...

16:32.368 --> 16:35.287
I mean, like I said on the phone,

16:35.371 --> 16:37.581
I want to ask you about those cops.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.460
They just wanted to know
about you and Rust.

16:41.585 --> 16:42.920
Mostly Rust.

16:43.003 --> 16:47.132
They wanted to know about the fight in '02.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.681
- Did you tell them?
- No.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.101
But they think Rust did something.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.646
I know. He didn't.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.690
I didn't think he did.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.614
You talk to him?

17:13.409 --> 17:15.327
No. Not since.

17:16.620 --> 17:17.621
You?

17:18.414 --> 17:22.000
Yeah. I mean, after they brought me in.
Yeah.

17:23.419 --> 17:26.255
- How is he?
- Different. Same.

17:26.338 --> 17:29.842
I mean, he's lived rough for a long time now.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.221
He always did, it seemed like.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.515
Taken a toll.

17:39.268 --> 17:41.103
He needs my help.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.772
Are you going to help him?

17:47.568 --> 17:48.736
Yes.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.654
Why?

17:52.489 --> 17:53.657
I have to.

17:54.658 --> 17:57.035
What is it?
What do the police think he did?

17:57.119 --> 17:59.705
I can't talk about that. It's P.I. stuff.

17:59.788 --> 18:03.250
He's hiring the firm. I'm hiring him.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.418
All this time,

18:04.501 --> 18:06.336
you two, and just...

18:07.004 --> 18:08.338
Just like that?

18:10.674 --> 18:12.426
I took some convincing.

18:15.471 --> 18:17.639
<i>I looked in Billy's eyes.</i>

18:17.973 --> 18:19.516
He looked in mine.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.685
He got me suspended.

18:24.062 --> 18:27.775
Now, Billy Lee Tuttle
owns three houses in Louisiana.

18:27.858 --> 18:31.278
One in Shreveport, one in Baton Rouge,
one in New Orleans.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.989
Also one in Florida.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.826
I waited till he went on his
Spring Ministry Tour in 2010.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.412
Look, Rust, I changed my mind.

18:40.496 --> 18:43.457
If you did something,
I don't want to hear about it.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.376
Remember I told you
about my stint in robbery?

18:47.002 --> 18:49.213
I make a pretty ace B&E man.

18:51.215 --> 18:54.009
<i>Now,
I staked his places out for weeks.</i>

18:54.092 --> 18:57.638
<i>Checked surveillance.
Mapped security. I found ingresses.</i>

18:57.721 --> 18:59.640
<i>And here I am, you know,</i>

18:59.723 --> 19:02.684
my whole life is this
one expanding, circular fuck-up

19:02.768 --> 19:04.144
and I think it's about to close out

19:04.228 --> 19:06.688
<i>with me getting clipped in a home invasion.</i>

19:06.772 --> 19:08.398
<i>All right, what I'm saying is</i>

19:08.482 --> 19:11.610
<i>I was aware that I might have lost my mind.</i>

19:23.455 --> 19:25.666
<i>But after the second home,</i>

19:27.376 --> 19:30.295
<i>doubt got taken behind the woodshed
and put down.</i>

19:33.882 --> 19:37.678
You'll notice he never reported
the Baton Rouge break-in.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.013
Just the Shreveport house.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.766
I found those in the safe there.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.936
The paper stock's over 15 years old.

19:46.019 --> 19:49.022
- God damn it.
- These...

19:49.106 --> 19:52.609
They aren't as bad if you don't
know what you're looking at.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.574
Motherfuck!

20:05.914 --> 20:06.957
And

20:10.419 --> 20:12.504
there was a videotape.

20:28.312 --> 20:30.230
Take a look.

21:42.803 --> 21:43.845
No!

21:45.472 --> 21:46.765
God!

21:48.183 --> 21:49.393
Jesus!

21:52.729 --> 21:53.855
Fuck!

22:00.070 --> 22:01.196
Fuck!

22:04.408 --> 22:05.909
You watch all of that?

22:06.743 --> 22:07.744
Yeah.

22:09.204 --> 22:12.165
I had to see if any of the men
took off their mask.

22:12.249 --> 22:13.792
None did.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.378
Fuck!

22:17.504 --> 22:21.258
I won't avert my eyes. Not again.

22:23.260 --> 22:24.761
Jesus Christ.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.059
That little girl's Marie Fontenot.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.357
Did you kill Tuttle?

22:37.441 --> 22:38.400
No.

22:38.483 --> 22:43.321
I assumed that he was thinking
he was going to be blackmailed.

22:43.405 --> 22:46.575
And I think some people
took him out after they found out

22:46.658 --> 22:49.661
what was taken from the safe,
before he had a chance to.

22:51.747 --> 22:55.000
What can I do to help?

22:57.419 --> 23:00.839
We start by pulling everything
there is on Dora Lange.

23:01.965 --> 23:05.886
And I got names, I got family members,
Tuttle connections.

23:05.969 --> 23:11.266
Any information that we can get
on Reggie or Dewall Ledoux.

23:11.349 --> 23:15.562
All right, we can coordinate
out of your offices if you want.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.738
You shouldn't have that.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.161
Nobody should have this.

23:39.461 --> 23:43.173
<i>I'm glad that you're doing good,
Maggie.</i>

23:44.257 --> 23:46.843
It seems like everybody is happy,
and it's...

23:48.095 --> 23:50.013
It's good to see.

23:51.389 --> 23:55.352
Thank you for everything.

23:57.312 --> 24:00.190
I haven't seen you in over two years, Marty.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.987
Did you come here to say goodbye?

24:09.241 --> 24:12.702
Thank you, Maggie. I mean that.

24:40.856 --> 24:45.193
There's not gonna be a bunch of people
coming in and out of this place, is there?

24:45.277 --> 24:47.487
What do you think, Rust?

24:50.866 --> 24:54.286
<i>Practical terms,
we're doing an identify and locate.</i>

24:54.369 --> 24:58.707
Now, I can't afford to subscribe
to all the databases that I used to,

24:58.790 --> 25:03.587
but I got the AutoTrackXP
for motor vehicle records.

25:03.670 --> 25:09.217
I got FlatRate Info for
the QI National People Locator.

25:09.301 --> 25:11.386
Public records, of course.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.638
All right, that sounds good.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.355
How you been?

25:22.439 --> 25:25.108
You know, besides work, what do you do?

25:27.777 --> 25:28.987
Sorry. I just...

25:29.070 --> 25:32.407
I don't ever remember you askin' me
a personal question before.

25:33.783 --> 25:38.705
You know, I just stay busy...

25:39.206 --> 25:41.708
Fish, girlfriends.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.543
You seein' anybody?

25:44.461 --> 25:47.547
Not really. Some dates.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.883
You know, it's all pretty casual.

25:52.260 --> 25:55.931
<i>I did have somethin' goin'
for a while, this Filipino girl.</i>

25:56.014 --> 25:57.849
<i>But that didn't pan out.</i>

26:02.812 --> 26:06.024
<i>Quiet life. I don't stay out late.
I just... I go home.</i>

26:21.081 --> 26:23.500
<i>- You?
- Yeah, I'm about the same.</i>

26:24.626 --> 26:27.587
<i>No girlfriend, just go to work and go home.</i>

26:50.944 --> 26:54.823
How about that girl you were seeing in '02?
What ever happened with her?

26:54.906 --> 26:59.953
Yeah, that was never going to last.
It never should have started.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.122
Yeah. No way.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.791
She had problems.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.960
You always liked 'em crazy.

27:07.961 --> 27:09.629
Yeah. That I did.

27:09.713 --> 27:11.673
Why did you quit, Marty?

27:13.383 --> 27:16.136
You could've been boss, you know.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.722
LT, at least. Captain.

27:19.764 --> 27:22.600
I did another four years after you left.

27:22.684 --> 27:26.521
And I guess the job just kind of
ran its course with me.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.065
How's that?

27:29.149 --> 27:32.861
I was gonna play baseball, ride bulls.

27:32.944 --> 27:36.656
You know, you end up becomin'
somethin' you never intended.

27:37.907 --> 27:41.494
I guess you never really even know why.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.167
I suppose I could've been a painter.

27:47.250 --> 27:51.171
You know, a historian.
Old scenes, new details.

27:52.130 --> 27:55.008
Yeah? Yeah, you do much paintin'?

27:55.091 --> 27:58.970
No. Little late in the game to
start somethin' like that, I reckon.

27:59.095 --> 28:02.640
Life's barely long enough
to get good at one thing.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.143
If that long.

28:05.226 --> 28:07.937
Yeah. So be careful what you get good at.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.863
What do you call a black man
who flies a plane?

28:16.946 --> 28:18.615
I don't know.

28:18.698 --> 28:21.951
A pilot, you racist bastard.
What else would you call him?

28:24.245 --> 28:27.582
Speaking of, you know I've been
takin' some writing courses.

28:27.665 --> 28:30.794
And... No, I have.

28:30.919 --> 28:35.507
And I've been tinkerin' around
with this thing off and on.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.133
True crime.

28:37.217 --> 28:38.885
And that's the genre, not the title.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.054
- You serious?
- Yeah.

28:41.137 --> 28:44.474
You know, what happened in '95,
and some other old cases.

28:44.557 --> 28:50.563
And all I need from you, Bobby,
is some old copies of case files.

28:53.566 --> 28:56.403
You still like your single malt, don't you?

28:58.530 --> 29:01.157
I guess I do.

29:03.118 --> 29:06.204
What, business gotten so bad,
you got to become a writer?

29:06.287 --> 29:09.207
Nope. I've always wanted to do it.
I just never had the time.

29:09.290 --> 29:13.086
And in regards of files,
I'd like to avoid Fuck and Suck,

29:13.169 --> 29:15.255
the two dicks I spent last Saturday with.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.467
Papania and Gilbough.
I hear you.

29:20.844 --> 29:22.262
Of course, man, whatever you need.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.600
- Appreciate it, Bobby.
- No problem.

29:29.185 --> 29:33.314
Missing persons mostly,
maybe far back as the '80s.

29:33.398 --> 29:37.735
Well, anything before '05 that never became
part of an official investigation,

29:37.819 --> 29:39.946
it isn't gonna be in the computers.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.157
You're gonna have to sort through the files.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.669
Thank you.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.534
<i>Found somethin'. Background.</i>

30:26.659 --> 30:30.205
Dewall Ledoux transferred title
on a truck to a Jimmy Ledoux.

30:30.288 --> 30:32.665
Appears like that might be a cousin.

30:32.749 --> 30:37.086
I found him in White Castle.
Owns an auto shop.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.256
All right.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.425
Did you pull that Marie Fontenot file?

30:43.593 --> 30:48.181
There wasn't one.
Report's gone. Back-trackin' that.

30:55.104 --> 30:58.733
Marty, this is Robert Doumain.
He owns the place.

30:59.817 --> 31:02.111
Hey, how's it goin'? Nice spot.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.699
He's not a cop no more, Robert.

31:07.617 --> 31:09.911
You got somethin' against cops?

31:10.828 --> 31:14.582
Bob had a little boy. Been missin' since '85.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.046
Sorry.

31:21.631 --> 31:26.970
<i>Jimmy Ledoux came up spotless.
Three kids, wife's a teacher.</i>

31:27.053 --> 31:29.639
<i>He coaches his boy's peewee football team.</i>

31:32.892 --> 31:34.227
Any relation?

31:34.310 --> 31:37.105
So many Ledouxs around,
I never had to worry about a connection.

31:37.188 --> 31:40.066
But, yeah, my dad's second cousin
or somethin'.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.443
My pop didn't like them none.

31:42.527 --> 31:46.114
Said they weren't white enough
to be white trash.

31:46.197 --> 31:48.074
What's this about exactly?

31:48.157 --> 31:50.577
Man asked us to locate his daughter.

31:50.660 --> 31:53.788
It was a long time ago, but it looks like
she might have known Dewall.

31:53.871 --> 31:54.914
Sorry to hear that.

31:54.998 --> 31:58.251
Must know what happened to them.
Sick shits.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.838
Pop said they died too quick.

32:01.921 --> 32:05.633
Is there anything you remember
that you can tell us about these guys?

32:05.717 --> 32:08.469
Just they were nuts. Looked at you funky.

32:09.637 --> 32:12.473
Reggie was always asking
about the girls in my school,

32:12.557 --> 32:15.768
and couple of times I saw him,
Dewall just said kooky stuff.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.981
Any chance you ever saw
a third man with them?

32:20.064 --> 32:24.193
A man who had a bunch of scars
on the bottom of his face?

32:29.073 --> 32:31.701
It's weird you say that.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.578
I remember that face.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.915
My pop let 'em use our deer camp once,
took me with 'em.

32:37.999 --> 32:41.628
I was, like, 11.
They were, maybe, 10 years older than me.

32:41.711 --> 32:43.963
They introduced us. The guy,

32:45.048 --> 32:48.217
his face, underneath his nose
and cheeks, scarred.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.013
Gave me funny looks all night.

32:52.096 --> 32:54.557
Every time I glanced at him, starin' at me.

32:56.768 --> 32:59.771
Any chance this man with scars
was another Ledoux?

32:59.854 --> 33:02.940
No. I don't know. I don't think so.

33:04.442 --> 33:08.655
Next mornin', the men were too hungover
to hunt. Pop and I went home.

33:08.738 --> 33:12.075
You ever see him again,
the guy with the scars?

33:13.785 --> 33:15.828
Never again.

33:15.912 --> 33:17.413
I'd remember.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.055
Fuck, I don't like this place.

33:35.264 --> 33:37.767
Nothin' grows in the right direction.

33:39.936 --> 33:42.105
Where'd this woman come from?

33:43.356 --> 33:47.318
Tax records.
Drew a paycheck from Tuttle's father.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.738
Some kind of domestic.

33:52.949 --> 33:53.950
How'd you find her?

33:54.784 --> 33:59.455
Well, I had to get federal income tax records
from '40 to '59.

34:00.873 --> 34:05.086
Match social with credit check run
in the late '90s

34:05.169 --> 34:08.005
for Section 8 housing in Alexandria.

34:09.173 --> 34:11.676
Good job. Look at you.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.513
High praise from a bartender.

34:31.320 --> 34:35.324
She gets tired easy,
especially hot as it is.

34:35.408 --> 34:37.410
I don't understand what this is about.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.412
Thank you.

34:39.495 --> 34:44.751
We're private investigators
hired to do ancestral research,

34:44.834 --> 34:47.003
mineral rights along the coast.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.049
I never knew them Tuttle people,
but I heard stories.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.385
No, thank you.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.304
You think she might get some money
out this?

34:56.387 --> 35:00.349
Quite possible.
Depends on what we find out.

35:04.562 --> 35:06.022
Miss Dolores.

35:07.440 --> 35:11.444
You worked for Mr. Sam Tuttle
19 years, right?

35:11.527 --> 35:13.863
Yes. Erath.

35:16.741 --> 35:18.326
Then Shreveport.

35:18.409 --> 35:21.120
So you knew his son, Billy Lee?

35:21.204 --> 35:22.580
Right?

35:22.663 --> 35:25.833
- A cousin, Eddie?
- Little boys.

35:26.334 --> 35:29.086
- I remember 'em.
- What about extended family?

35:29.170 --> 35:32.215
Cousins, you know,
might have been close to the boys?

35:33.049 --> 35:35.384
Those days, families were bigger.

35:36.219 --> 35:40.890
All sorts of brothers, cousins,
kids just running around.

35:40.973 --> 35:45.561
Did Sam Tuttle have kids
outside his marriage that you know about?

35:45.645 --> 35:48.022
Don't you know it.

35:50.149 --> 35:53.486
Now, people kept their own back then.

35:53.569 --> 35:57.240
I mean, a man's house was his own.

35:58.032 --> 36:02.245
Mr. Sam, he had lots of children,

36:02.328 --> 36:04.163
all types.

36:05.748 --> 36:07.625
He didn't like a woman...

36:11.254 --> 36:14.090
See, once she had it done to her,

36:14.757 --> 36:17.844
he didn't like 'em but that one time.

36:17.927 --> 36:19.887
Not after that.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.390
With all these kids runnin' around,

36:23.975 --> 36:28.729
you remember one that maybe had
scars all across the bottom of his face?

36:29.564 --> 36:33.359
I think that was Mr. Sam's grandchild.

36:33.442 --> 36:37.071
His daddy did that to him, that poor boy.

36:37.989 --> 36:41.534
I think that child was a Childress.

36:41.617 --> 36:44.245
What, Fi? He was a LeBeau or a Childress?

36:44.328 --> 36:46.581
From Mr. Sam's other family?

36:49.417 --> 36:52.837
I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.422
No, it's okay.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.466
Miss Dolores,

36:58.759 --> 37:00.803
could you have a look at somethin' for me?
One thing.

37:00.887 --> 37:03.681
Just have a look. See if you recognize it.

37:13.316 --> 37:14.942
You know Carcosa?

37:16.319 --> 37:17.320
What is it?

37:22.950 --> 37:25.953
Him who eats time.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.499
Him robes...

37:32.126 --> 37:35.296
It's a wind of invisible voices.

37:36.047 --> 37:37.465
"Mineral rights," my ass.

37:37.548 --> 37:39.216
- What y'all doin'?
- Rejoice.

37:40.343 --> 37:42.762
Death is not the end. Rejoice!

37:42.845 --> 37:43.971
You need to leave, now.

37:44.055 --> 37:45.973
Death is not the end.

37:46.057 --> 37:47.350
You need to leave.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.435
You know Carcosa.

37:50.561 --> 37:53.648
You rejoice. Carcosa...

38:22.385 --> 38:25.554
The rest of the family,
they don't really talk to Aunt D.

38:25.638 --> 38:28.391
She crazy. Dementia.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.645
She never had any kind of good life.
But most days, she can't even make sense.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.814
Yeah? She sure made sense to me.

38:36.023 --> 38:38.234
That should worry you, mister.

38:49.078 --> 38:50.997
I sure hope that old lady was wrong.

38:51.706 --> 38:55.334
- About what?
- About death not being the end of it.

39:04.051 --> 39:07.096
Did some back-trackin'
on the Marie Fontenot stuff.

39:07.179 --> 39:08.472
Got some old sheets.

39:08.556 --> 39:12.018
Sheriff signed off on the report made in error.

39:12.101 --> 39:15.021
But he didn't take
the original complaint on her.

39:15.104 --> 39:16.439
Deputy did.

39:18.315 --> 39:19.692
Got a name?

39:20.901 --> 39:22.778
You ain't going to believe this shit.

39:23.571 --> 39:25.489
Steve Geraci.

39:25.573 --> 39:27.450
So I did some double-checkin'.

39:27.533 --> 39:31.245
Before CID, he was with
Vermilion Parish Sheriff's.

39:31.328 --> 39:33.789
Erath was his beat.

39:33.873 --> 39:37.668
If it got covered up,
Steve might know something.

39:37.752 --> 39:41.630
Didn't say a fucking word
when we asked about it in '95.

39:41.714 --> 39:44.050
I never did like that cocksucker.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.343
Where is he now?

39:46.427 --> 39:48.804
Well, this is the thing.

39:50.598 --> 39:55.728
He's from Iberia, originally.
After CID, he went home.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.856
He's sheriff of Iberia Parish.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.233
- Shit.
- Yeah.

40:01.317 --> 40:06.155
Rust, the only person can arrest
a sheriff in this state is the governor.

40:06.238 --> 40:09.283
Well, we ain't lookin' to arrest him, Marty.

40:09.366 --> 40:11.535
Just have a little chat.

40:11.619 --> 40:13.537
He ain't gonna talk with you.

40:13.621 --> 40:17.041
I got a car battery and two jumper cables
who argue different.

40:17.124 --> 40:18.876
Don't even start with that shit.

40:18.959 --> 40:20.961
What do you recommend, Marty?

40:21.045 --> 40:24.590
Well, fuck, why don't you talk to him?
You two always liked each other.

40:25.466 --> 40:27.676
Well, what can I say? I'm a people person.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.678
Start with that, then.

40:34.517 --> 40:37.478
Come on.

40:37.561 --> 40:39.980
Just try to relax. Take your time.

40:43.442 --> 40:44.777
There you go.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.862
- Okay.
- Nice shot.

40:46.946 --> 40:48.864
What was that? Fifteen on the green?

40:49.073 --> 40:52.034
I don't know.

40:56.205 --> 40:59.708
Hey, you know, on the phone, you were
saying somethin' about that Fontenot girl.

40:59.792 --> 41:02.211
- Yeah.
- Why is that on your radar?

41:02.628 --> 41:05.589
It's nothing. It's just...

41:05.673 --> 41:08.425
Extended family wants a locate.

41:09.593 --> 41:12.471
I didn't remember at the time, back in '95.

41:13.264 --> 41:16.475
- I was hittin' the bottle a lot back then.
- Yeah. Who wasn't?

41:17.852 --> 41:19.937
Twenty years ago, you know.

41:21.814 --> 41:24.900
My recall, girl's mom was single.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.528
Drug charges.

41:32.366 --> 41:35.161
Little girl went to live with her birth daddy.

41:36.078 --> 41:39.248
I think. That is, if I'm rememberin' right.

41:41.500 --> 41:46.088
Momma didn't make a fuss after
the first notice, so she was fine with it.

41:49.258 --> 41:53.095
You talk to the family directly, back then?

41:53.179 --> 41:57.183
No. Ted Childress, the sheriff. He knew 'em.

41:58.809 --> 42:00.144
Childress.

42:01.604 --> 42:03.272
Now, watch this.

42:07.902 --> 42:09.695
You like that?

42:09.778 --> 42:12.573
Seized it off a good ol' boy,
had a quarter bag of weed.

42:14.074 --> 42:16.702
You got to love this country.

42:16.785 --> 42:19.788
- Good to see you again, man.
- Good to see you.

42:22.374 --> 42:27.004
Hey, that client you got,
askin' about the Fontenot girl.

42:28.631 --> 42:31.133
You let 'em know I'd be happy to talk to 'em.

42:31.217 --> 42:36.055
Yeah. Distant relatives,
Saint Louis, trying to settle a tiny inheritance.

42:36.138 --> 42:37.973
Don't worry about it.

42:39.016 --> 42:43.062
Okay, well, they want to talk,
you let 'em know.

42:43.145 --> 42:44.146
Yeah.

42:44.230 --> 42:46.440
Don't go too fast, Sheriff.

42:46.523 --> 42:48.400
Not me.

42:48.484 --> 42:51.779
- Let's do it again sometime.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

43:01.956 --> 43:02.998
Hey.

43:04.416 --> 43:07.086
Better get those jumper cables ready.

43:07.169 --> 43:09.004
Motherfucker's lyin'.

43:53.048 --> 43:54.133
Rust.

43:56.218 --> 43:58.345
- It's good to see you.
- Bullshit.

44:05.936 --> 44:08.147
I talked to Marty.

44:08.230 --> 44:10.691
Well, you talked to the cops, too.

44:10.774 --> 44:12.276
Yes, them, too.

44:13.569 --> 44:15.446
How are you?

44:15.529 --> 44:17.531
What did Marty tell you?

44:17.614 --> 44:19.950
He wanted to know
what the police asked me about.

44:20.034 --> 44:23.412
He said he was helpin' you with somethin'.
That's it.

44:25.289 --> 44:28.459
- How long you've been back?
- Hear you got a big house.

44:29.043 --> 44:31.962
Marty says the girls are doin' fine.

44:32.046 --> 44:33.047
That's good.

44:34.840 --> 44:39.386
Rust, just tell me it's somethin'
that's not gonna get him hurt.

44:40.721 --> 44:42.848
Well, I can't tell you that.

44:45.601 --> 44:49.563
It never sat right with me then,
and it doesn't now.

44:49.646 --> 44:52.274
You askin' me to lie to you about him.

44:54.151 --> 44:57.321
Get on out of here.
You're classin' the place up.

45:05.704 --> 45:07.664
Why did you quit, Marty?

45:08.665 --> 45:11.335
What's the real reason? What happened?

45:11.418 --> 45:14.254
You tell me why you come back, for real.

45:14.338 --> 45:15.672
You first.

45:17.383 --> 45:18.926
Why'd you quit?

45:19.802 --> 45:23.389
Well, I saw somethin'.

45:24.640 --> 45:25.849
A baby.

45:28.602 --> 45:32.773
<i>Tweaker tried to
dry the kid in a microwave.</i>

45:42.574 --> 45:45.327
<i>Saw that, what he'd done, and I thought,</i>

45:48.455 --> 45:49.957
"Never again."

45:52.000 --> 45:57.464
I thought I never wanted to look
at anything like that anymore.

46:04.012 --> 46:05.347
Your turn.

46:06.265 --> 46:09.351
Why'd you... Why'd you come back?

46:15.691 --> 46:16.984
For this.

46:18.068 --> 46:20.112
Somethin' I had to see to.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.408
Before getting on with somethin' else.

46:31.915 --> 46:36.503
My life's been a circle
of violence and degradation

46:36.587 --> 46:38.505
long as I can remember.

46:40.424 --> 46:42.384
I'm ready to tie it off.

46:45.554 --> 46:47.306
See you on the boat.

47:00.569 --> 47:05.782
After the other day, I was thinkin',
"Why don't I see Steve and the boys more?"

47:07.201 --> 47:09.745
Ain't been out to my camp in a while.

47:11.413 --> 47:16.084
You know, if I don't get out here
three or four times a year,

47:16.502 --> 47:19.588
- I'm a basket case.
- I hear you.

47:24.134 --> 47:27.846
I do love a reason to drink beer
first thing in the mornin'.

47:32.184 --> 47:35.103
Say, Steve, I was wanting to ask...

47:36.647 --> 47:40.776
You know that Fontenot girl,
remember, goin' off with her daddy?

47:42.194 --> 47:43.654
I just wasn't clear.

47:43.737 --> 47:48.033
Was it you knew for a fact
that she went with her daddy?

47:48.116 --> 47:50.911
Or somebody told you that's what happened?

47:52.204 --> 47:55.374
The family talked to Sheriff Childress.

47:55.457 --> 47:59.002
The girl's aunt and uncle, he knew them.

48:03.549 --> 48:05.050
Who were they?

48:11.056 --> 48:15.185
I'm startin' to think this wasn't just
a friendly invitation from an old pal?

48:15.269 --> 48:17.062
It's definitely that.

48:18.146 --> 48:19.898
Well, then try this, then.

48:19.982 --> 48:22.276
I said all I remember about the girl,

48:22.359 --> 48:25.696
let's just have a good time
and don't ask again.

48:26.905 --> 48:30.951
- I'm with you 150% on that.
- All right.

48:31.827 --> 48:33.495
Thing is, Steve,

48:35.163 --> 48:36.331
I ain't gonna ask you.

48:39.459 --> 48:40.669
He is.

48:46.091 --> 48:48.385
I wouldn't if I was you, Steve.

48:50.512 --> 48:53.015
You're out of your jurisdiction,
Sheriff.

48:53.098 --> 48:56.226
You realize who I am now, you assholes?

48:56.310 --> 48:58.854
Yeah, I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

49:00.355 --> 49:01.982
- Marty...
- Don't look at me.

49:02.065 --> 49:04.610
I ain't never been able to control him.

49:04.693 --> 49:05.694
Come on.

49:06.737 --> 49:08.697
You're done after this.

49:08.780 --> 49:11.617
I'll have boss cracker
splittin' your ass in Angola.

49:11.700 --> 49:12.868
Yeah, we'll talk about that,

49:14.161 --> 49:16.038
and some other things. Come on.

49:33.388 --> 49:36.683
That church Cohle talked about,
supposed to be right here.

49:36.767 --> 49:39.227
- We're lost.
- We're not lost.

49:39.311 --> 49:41.480
We goin' in the right direction,
we're headin' south.

49:41.563 --> 49:43.148
And that's gonna head us to 49.

49:43.231 --> 49:45.734
No, we're not looking for the 49.
We're lookin' for the church.

49:45.817 --> 49:48.320
I know we're looking for the church,
we ain't got to no church.

49:48.403 --> 49:50.155
Ain't seen nothing that
even resemble no church.

49:50.238 --> 49:51.490
Ain't nobody out here to even ask.

49:51.573 --> 49:54.326
Just let me know when you see somethin'.
Let me know when you see somethin'.

49:54.409 --> 49:55.911
There ain't nothin' to see.

50:00.374 --> 50:02.084
Hey! Hey!

50:06.421 --> 50:07.422
Yes, sir.

50:07.506 --> 50:11.718
You know there's a little church around here?
Pretty old? Black minister?

50:11.802 --> 50:14.096
You must mean Son of Life, sir.

50:15.263 --> 50:17.599
That place shut down.

50:17.683 --> 50:20.310
'05 I think. Just after all them hurricanes.

50:23.105 --> 50:26.692
- You live around here?
- No, sir. I live in St. Martin.

50:26.817 --> 50:28.360
Got a parish contract.

50:28.443 --> 50:31.947
Take care of some cemeteries, public schools.

50:32.030 --> 50:34.116
All right. Thanks.

50:34.199 --> 50:37.786
- Hey. You know how to get to 49 from here?
- Sure.

50:37.869 --> 50:43.250
About a half mile, you'll see a left, PR 1435,
take that.

50:44.042 --> 50:48.964
About seven miles of fields,
you'll hit 49 before Crowley.

50:49.047 --> 50:51.717
- Know your way around?
- Yeah, boss.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.593
I know the whole coast.

50:53.677 --> 50:54.970
- My family...
- Thanks.

51:15.449 --> 51:19.202
My family's been here a long, long time.
