WEBVTT

00:16.517 --> 00:18.185
DEENA: Previously on Powers...

00:18.269 --> 00:19.478
Where the fuck
have you been?

00:19.603 --> 00:22.106
At Supershock's.
He's lost his mind.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.482
He's literally crazy.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.193
We have seven
possible Powers bodies

00:26.277 --> 00:29.613
that have just
dropped out of the sky
dead all around the city.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.365
Fuck me.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.534
Come on, Patrick.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.703
I know you can hear me
if you want to.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.205
Why would Supershock
be killing all the Powers?

00:38.289 --> 00:40.207
It's not.
It's this Morrison maniac.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.293
Kutter's in a coma
because of that asshole.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.544
(SCREAMS)

00:43.627 --> 00:45.045
Where are you hiding him?

00:45.129 --> 00:47.256
Why are your
powers hiding Morrison?

00:47.339 --> 00:48.507
Where is he?

00:48.632 --> 00:49.800
CALISTA: He tried to kill me.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.635
He kept calling me "Janice".

00:52.136 --> 00:54.472
DR. MARRS: Have you had
any contact with an
active Power?

00:54.597 --> 00:56.474
All right. Call dispatch.
This body...

00:56.640 --> 00:57.892
Aah!

00:57.975 --> 01:00.144
DR. MARRS: Every Power
that we have contact with is,

01:00.269 --> 01:04.023
technically,
if you think about
it, a biological hazard.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.400
(BEEPING)
We don't know how
this environment is affecting

01:06.484 --> 01:08.486
our biological machines.
(CRACKLING)

01:08.611 --> 01:10.488
WALKER: Supershock killed
the senator.
(GASPS)

01:10.613 --> 01:14.909
If a Power at this level
is taking the law
into his own hands,

01:16.410 --> 01:17.661
what the fuck do we do?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.164
Let's do this.
Let's stop him.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.832
I would like to help.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.878
(CHUCKLES)

01:26.003 --> 01:29.882
So, how do we kill
the highest-level
Power ever?

01:30.007 --> 01:31.509
DEENA: We give him
something he wants.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.469
Everybody, meet Morrison.

01:34.345 --> 01:36.889
Morrison, everybody.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.394
(WIND HOWLING)

02:20.641 --> 02:22.393
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

02:35.447 --> 02:37.116
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

02:37.241 --> 02:38.867
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

04:33.023 --> 04:34.983
WALKER: Why would he just
turn himself in?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.276
He didn't even
put up a struggle.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.444
DEENA: He didn't.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.821
Dude just surrendered.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.700
That motherfucker has
outlived his expiration date.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.119
Can I trust you in there?

04:45.202 --> 04:48.247
Sure.
I brought him in, didn't I?

04:48.372 --> 04:50.791
You didn't answer
my question, Detective.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.920
Yes, Sir. I just want to get
a confession out of him,

04:55.713 --> 04:57.798
put his ass on ice
for the rest of
his sorry life,

04:57.881 --> 04:59.925
and get back to
fighting the good fight.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.051
All right then.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.471
Maybe Morrison is a key
to at least figuring out

05:04.555 --> 05:06.181
where the hell SuperShock is.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.267
The bastard won't
survive SuperShock.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.687
Perhaps.
But it's a chance
I'm willing to take.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.896
Commander...

05:12.980 --> 05:14.148
CROSS: Let's put the
word out there.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.150
Talk to your
reporter friend at PTB.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.444
Nicole Glantz.
Tell her we've got Morrison.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.362
That's not a good idea.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.906
Fine. (SIGHS)

05:23.532 --> 05:25.159
Gary, get Fuller in here.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.702
Fuller?

05:27.411 --> 05:29.830
Can you think
of a less conspicuous
Deep Throat?

05:30.122 --> 05:32.416
Meanwhile, get what you can
out of Morrison.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.335
Confession, clue,
stock tips, whatever.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.713
And keep him
out of your head, Pilgrim.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.758
Remember, he's been
working people for decades,
maybe longer.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.220
Don't worry.
I have a good fucking idea
of how to handle him.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.805
As Powers continue to die,

06:27.930 --> 06:30.098
murdered and falling
to the streets,

06:30.182 --> 06:32.100
the institution
charged with investigating

06:32.184 --> 06:34.228
and stopping
these killings has,

06:34.311 --> 06:35.354
and I quote,

06:35.479 --> 06:37.481
"No comment."

06:37.564 --> 06:39.650
What is the Powers
Division hiding?

06:39.775 --> 06:43.904
Is it their complete
and utter inability to
keep the public safe?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.656
We want answers.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.496
Big man, big appetite.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.498
Hey, I like it spicy too.

06:54.623 --> 06:57.501
I wasn't expecting you.
Like, actually you.
Like...

06:57.584 --> 06:59.419
I was thinking you'd send
like a minion or something.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.754
Someone from
the Powers Division

07:00.838 --> 07:02.714
tells my assistant
they've got a tip,

07:02.840 --> 07:04.758
I'm all ears.
They can't use my name.

07:04.842 --> 07:08.345
Absolutely no,
Mr. "Unnamed Source."
You have my word.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.013
So, what's the story?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.765
You've got something
on the Powers killings?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.642
We've got
a suspect in custody.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.810
Who?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.563
Oh, come on.
Don't chicken out now.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.816
His name is Morrison.

07:21.900 --> 07:22.943
The Morrison?

07:23.026 --> 07:24.903
SuperShock's nemesis.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.615
But he's dead.
He's been dead
for a long time.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.076
(CHUCKLES) Nope.
Holy shit.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.704
He's behind the killings?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.206
Does SuperShock know?

07:36.290 --> 07:37.875
If he did,
would I be out here?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.793
And Cross.
He's buried this,
hasn't he?

07:39.877 --> 07:43.255
Commander Cross.
He's afraid of SuperShock
going all vigilante.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.215
Yeah. Morrison's a maniac.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.885
Total. And he's sitting
in Powers Division right now

07:48.010 --> 07:50.220
like a fox in
a goddamn henhouse.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.556
Hell, yes. Ah.

07:52.723 --> 07:53.724
Hey, thank you.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.434
Thank you.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.062
Holy shit!

07:59.187 --> 08:01.565
Move the fuck over,
James Bond.
(DIALING)

08:03.066 --> 08:04.067
(DOOR CLOSES)

08:04.860 --> 08:08.196
Detectives Pilgrim and Walker,
resuming questioning

08:09.823 --> 08:12.075
of suspect John Morrison.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.997
So you're The Ghost?

08:17.915 --> 08:20.125
You are SuperShock's
nemesis? (CHUCKLES)

08:20.709 --> 08:21.960
I thought you'd be...

08:23.295 --> 08:24.755
I don't know, more.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.798
What are you doing here?

08:26.924 --> 08:29.843
Why did you come in
peacefully with
Detective Pilgrim?

08:29.927 --> 08:33.347
Let's just say
I'm not the man
I used to be.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.933
Stop fucking around,
Morrison,
what does that mean?

08:36.058 --> 08:37.309
Time, Detective.

08:38.644 --> 08:39.937
Cosmic drainer.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.147
She gets us all eventually,

08:42.272 --> 08:43.774
even The Ghost.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.567
Ever since my
powers failed me,

08:45.651 --> 08:47.611
I've tried to
lead a quiet life.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.030
A simple life.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.908
I've taken great pains
to avoid controversy.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.452
You lost your powers...
So stabbing a police officer

08:55.577 --> 08:57.829
in the guts is your idea
of a quiet life?

08:57.955 --> 09:01.541
That was a mistake.
A grave error in judgment.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.461
Your colleague
took me by surprise.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.254
Yeah, I bet he fucking did.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.965
We have
a surprise for you too.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.133
A surprise?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.718
WALKER: We kind of
told the press

09:11.802 --> 09:13.804
we're hiding you here,
so it's only a matter of time

09:13.887 --> 09:16.056
before SuperShock finds out.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.058
Why would you do
something like that?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.643
Grave error in judgment.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.061
Or some shit like that.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.771
You've been
standing in front
of the oncoming train

09:22.854 --> 09:24.773
that is SuperShock
all your life.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.608
You can't blame
us if it hits you.

09:26.692 --> 09:27.818
So, I'm bait?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.111
WALKER: Yeah.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.154
Whatever happened
to protect and to serve?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.949
We do it on
a case by case basis
here at Powers Division.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.494
(SIGHS)

09:38.829 --> 09:40.622
I hope you're not going to
let your colleague here

09:40.706 --> 09:42.624
convince you to do
something you'll regret.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.751
Are you talking
to her or me?

09:46.169 --> 09:48.463
See, I think you're confusing
the good cop, bad cop thing.

09:48.547 --> 09:52.050
See, uh, I'm the good
cop and she is...

09:52.175 --> 09:57.180
Well, Detective Pilgrim
would just as soon kill
you as talk to you.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.682
You know why?

10:01.351 --> 10:04.688
Because you didn't just
stab her colleague,

10:05.230 --> 10:07.024
you violently attacked
the man she loves.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.483
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:11.945 --> 10:13.030
What do you want from me?

10:13.155 --> 10:14.281
WALKER: I want your help.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.409
Yeah, you're probably
the last person alive

10:17.534 --> 10:20.120
that knows SuperShock
as well as Janice.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.622
Giving us a hint,
or a clue,

10:22.706 --> 10:24.499
anything that would
get through to him

10:24.583 --> 10:29.379
to stop him from
tearing apart the city,
fuck the whole world,

10:29.504 --> 10:30.881
would be a big help.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.050
That's a tall order.
Huh?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.886
And quite frankly,
there isn't time to
give you the full story.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.387
You have time.
(CHUCKLES)

10:37.929 --> 10:39.014
I'll give you the headline.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.098
Please.

10:40.223 --> 10:45.062
SuperShock is completely, 100%

10:45.145 --> 10:47.230
out of his mind.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.733
If he decides to destroy
the entire world,

10:49.858 --> 10:53.111
there's absolutely nothing,
and I mean nothing,

10:53.236 --> 10:57.866
that any of us,
living Power or otherwise,
can do about it.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.459
You look so good.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.461
(CHUCKLES)
I look like an idiot.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.921
You look heroic.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.091
Calista? Can I talk
to you for a second?

11:14.174 --> 11:17.594
Honestly, do you
ever get used to this?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.471
Oh, no, that's always
the hardest part,

11:19.596 --> 11:21.431
is getting used
to the outfit.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.518
Yeah.
Not so much for me.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.771
(CHUCKLES)
That's because you always
wanted to be a Power.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.024
Well,
you're a Power now too.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.862
What's up?
What's up is that.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.781
We're feeling
a little not consulted.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.074
About what?

11:39.157 --> 11:40.575
About him joining the team.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.911
We talked about this.
And you made a decision.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.913
We need him.
He doesn't want in, Calista.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.833
You're forcing
this on him and us.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.000
MARTINEZ: He's untested.

11:49.126 --> 11:52.045
I would say he's just going
to get himself killed,
but so what?

11:52.129 --> 11:54.131
What's 'what' is
he's going to get us killed.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.966
No, I won't.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.635
They're right.
This is a bad idea.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.095
Krispin, don't...

12:00.178 --> 12:02.430
Honestly, I hate Powers.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.142
I hate you.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.811
The last thing
I want is to be part
of this bullshit.

12:10.856 --> 12:11.940
Certainly Retro
Girl must have warned

12:12.023 --> 12:13.400
you about this,
Detective Walker.

12:15.777 --> 12:16.945
She didn't tell you?

12:17.028 --> 12:18.321
She told me enough.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.407
Then you know about Caracas.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.242
I know about the earthquake.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.994
It was no earthquake,
Detective.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.705
It was SuperShock.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.456
Oh, the fuck you say.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.542
They did a good job
of covering it up.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.669
Well, Janice did.

12:32.794 --> 12:36.298
Man, that woman
knew how to spin a story.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.595
Thousands and thousands of
innocent people killed

12:41.678 --> 12:43.972
at the hands of
an out-of-control monster,

12:44.055 --> 12:47.142
and the world
believes it was
a natural disaster.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.397
And the cherry on top
is that a grateful
public is convinced

12:52.522 --> 12:55.150
that SuperShock, Retro Girl,

12:56.026 --> 12:59.654
and that poor devil
Cobalt Knight
came to the rescue.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.199
My God!

13:03.158 --> 13:04.618
(CHUCKLES) Genius.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.620
So you had
nothing to do with it?

13:06.703 --> 13:08.747
I was rotting away
in a Gulag.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.041
Put there by
Khrushchev himself.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.752
Even if I wanted
to mix it up with Patrick,
by then,

13:13.877 --> 13:15.795
my powers had begun to wane.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.631
You know that
Patrick thinks
you're responsible

13:17.714 --> 13:19.257
for just about
every chaotic thing

13:19.382 --> 13:21.885
that's happened
in the world since

we had quite the game
of cat-and-mouse

going for a while,
but that was a long time ago.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.309
And since then?

Since then?
Well, let's see.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.690
(SIGHS) I read the newspaper.
I drank red wine.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.108
I joined a bowling league.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.736
I opened a record shop.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.366
Always did have
a passion for music.

13:44.449 --> 13:48.745

of staying far away

13:48.828 --> 13:50.747

do with Powers.

What about SuperShock,
where has he been
for 40 years?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.296
Well, I can only imagine

13:58.421 --> 14:00.423
that Retro Girl must have
convinced him to retire.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.551
Kept him and his madness
out of public view.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.303
Kept him protected
and isolated,

14:05.428 --> 14:08.807
and in so doing,
protected the world from him.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.936
When I heard
she had been murdered, well,

14:13.019 --> 14:14.312

just a matter of time

14:14.437 --> 14:16.106

was in the Navy,
he was in the blockade.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.522
All this grief.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.900
Just end it.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.528
Rip out the world's heart

24:49.071 --> 24:51.532
and simply watch it die.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.535
Save yourself.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.374
I can't do that, Janice.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.752
I can't do that.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.255
I'm sorry, Janice.
I just can't do that.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.674
(ECHOING) Janice!

25:10.426 --> 25:11.469
Janice!

25:14.597 --> 25:15.598
Patrick.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.229
Patrick?
(WIND HOWLING)

25:24.440 --> 25:26.108
(SWITCH CLICKING)

25:26.192 --> 25:27.526
Patrick?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.452
He's not here.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.457
Wow, this is where
the greatest superhero
of all time made his home?

25:42.667 --> 25:43.709
It's depressing.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.379
In a weird way, I get it.
Really?

25:46.462 --> 25:48.547
The noise.
It gets to you
after a while.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.716
Of the city?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.259
No, of the world.

25:52.343 --> 25:53.886
Super-hearing.
It's kind of a bitch.

25:56.639 --> 25:57.807
Wow. Huh?

26:00.226 --> 26:02.436
All of these magazines
are from the 80s.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.985
It's Janice's handwriting.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.486
Morrison was right.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.573
Janice convinced
Patrick to come stay up here.

26:15.992 --> 26:19.245
She was taking care of him.
Was keeping him calm.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.539
ZORA: How did she find
the time to do that?

26:21.664 --> 26:22.915
I mean,
she had personal appearances.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.333
She's fighting
battles all over the world.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.836
How did she come up here
to take care of him?

26:26.919 --> 26:30.172
Hardly a hop,
skip, and a jump away,
even for Powers.

26:31.382 --> 26:32.508
Things you do for love.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.012
What do you think, Walker?

26:37.304 --> 26:38.973
I'm thinking she
should have told me.

26:40.725 --> 26:42.977
You know,
I could have helped her.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.604
Helped him.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.106
Well, is that even possible?

26:47.189 --> 26:48.983
To help him I mean?

26:49.066 --> 26:52.069
Well, she did it
for 40 years.

26:58.075 --> 27:01.037
She didn't just come to him,
he came to her.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.538
That looks familiar.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.046
Yeah. It's the final approach
to Griffith Park.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.342
Yeah, sure, okay.

27:15.426 --> 27:16.635
(BOTH LAUGHING)

27:19.180 --> 27:20.222
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:27.063 --> 27:28.564
What the fuck.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.857
How'd you get my address?

27:29.940 --> 27:32.359
Such a thing as privacy,
you know?

27:32.443 --> 27:34.195
Not when it comes
to public safety.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.405
Glantz...

27:36.822 --> 27:38.199
You're tap dancing
on my last nerve.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.743
I'm gonna need
you to get gone,
before I get you gone.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.870
What happened at
Powers Division

27:42.953 --> 27:44.705
between Morrison
and SuperShock?

27:52.671 --> 27:54.298
None of your
goddamn business.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.759
I know about SuperShock.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.261
Off the reservation,
isn't he?

27:59.345 --> 28:01.472
We've got cellphone
footage of SuperShock
grabbing Rainbow

28:01.597 --> 28:02.973
right before her death.

28:03.224 --> 28:06.602
In that case,
I've got you withholding
evidence of a crime,

28:06.727 --> 28:09.438
I can haul your
ass to jail right now
until you turn it over.

28:09.522 --> 28:11.440
I'm just trying to
get to the truth.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.442
Oh, give me
a fucking break, Nicole.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.069
SuperShock is
terrorizing the city,

28:15.152 --> 28:18.322
and Powers Division
hasn't got one goddamn
clue what to do, do you?

28:18.447 --> 28:21.200
You guys are fucked
and now so is the world.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.368
It's a good story.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.744
It's a fucking
Pulitzer Prize...
(GRUNTS)

28:33.420 --> 28:34.797
(CRACKLING)

28:39.593 --> 28:41.387
Oh, no, not this,
not right now.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.683
MARTINEZ: This is like looking
through grandpa's garage.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.144
Document scans go
back to the 1940s.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.396
Anything on SuperShock?
Yeah, tons.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.274
Triphammer documented
everything up to Caracas.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.818
Pretty much the same
with Retro Girl
until her death.

28:57.611 --> 28:58.988
Oh, man.

28:59.113 --> 29:00.281
What?

29:00.781 --> 29:02.491
It's his personal diary.

29:04.285 --> 29:07.163
"I don't actually believe
in everlasting love,

29:07.246 --> 29:10.124
"but if there were a candidate
it would have been Janice.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.835
"She made me feel whole for
the first time in my life."

29:15.379 --> 29:16.463
Shouldn't have read that.

29:16.547 --> 29:17.590
No.
Hmm.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.176
Okay.

29:20.301 --> 29:22.678
The name Janice
first appeared in 1985.

29:23.345 --> 29:24.680
Listen to this.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.807
"Feels weird to
call her Janice.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.851
"Maybe someday
I'll get used to it.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.729
"She introduced me
to Diamond today.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.439
"Cocky fucker.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.608
"Why she shtups him,
I have no idea."

29:37.902 --> 29:39.028
But he was Diamond.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.864
Yeah, no shit.
Here's another entry.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.325
"Janice got
serious on me today.

29:44.408 --> 29:47.661
"Over wine she warned me,
one day we may have to
deal with a Power

29:47.745 --> 29:51.665
"that can't be fought,
can't be stopped.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.125
"Not even by her.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.377
"She genuinely
looked frightened.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.881
"Never thought
I would see that in her."

29:59.006 --> 30:01.091
Man, she was talking
about SuperShock.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.468
Yeah.
(DOOR OPENS)

30:03.469 --> 30:04.511
Did you find him?

30:04.595 --> 30:05.596
No.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.599
There's a chance that
we might find him at
Griffith Park.

30:08.724 --> 30:09.767
So how do we stop him?

30:09.892 --> 30:11.227
How did Retro Girl do it?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.605
She just took care
of him for so long.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.025
I wonder if SuperShock
even remembers it...

30:19.109 --> 30:22.655
Well, he's...
He's our responsibility now.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.574
Do you have a plan?

30:25.699 --> 30:27.534
I have some ideas.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.955
Mostly, I have faith, hope.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.417
Oh, so,
not a great plan then?

30:35.501 --> 30:37.419
I have faith
that you guys

30:38.087 --> 30:41.215
can be better
heroes than I was...
Am.

30:41.799 --> 30:44.760
You know why
Janice didn't tell me
about Patrick?

30:44.843 --> 30:47.179
Because she was
protecting me.

30:47.263 --> 30:49.765
She knew "Diamond"
couldn't handle it.

30:51.892 --> 30:54.270
Put on that suit
for all the wrong reasons,

30:57.022 --> 30:59.900
and she couldn't trust me.
Not with this.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.071
So, the question is...

31:05.447 --> 31:07.283
(SIGHS)

31:07.366 --> 31:08.784
Do you guys trust me?

31:13.497 --> 31:15.207

Hmm?

31:43.652 --> 31:45.195

off to a bad start.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.671
Okay, here's the thing.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.341
A very important thing
you need to know.

32:07.343 --> 32:10.012
I have not been
in control of my
actions lately.

32:10.763 --> 32:13.015
Shit just gets to me,

32:13.140 --> 32:16.852
and, well,
I leap before I look,
you understand?

32:18.228 --> 32:19.229
Yeah.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.735
You nearly killed
the only man I ever loved.

32:26.904 --> 32:28.822
That's a fucking
lot to say. (SCOFFS)

32:29.698 --> 32:31.200
And you think
I'd wanna kill you.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.870
When all I really
wanna do is kiss you.

Shit.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.831
Where's Diamond?

33:19.540 --> 33:21.792
He's not here right now.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.257
Why do you look
so familiar to me?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.759
Uh, well, you saved
my life once.

33:31.552 --> 33:32.719
You let me
just call Diamond?

33:32.803 --> 33:34.513
I'm sure he'd want to know
you're looking for him.

33:34.596 --> 33:35.931
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

33:36.473 --> 33:37.766
Give him a buzz.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.893

Oh!

33:39.977 --> 33:42.020
(CHUCKLES)

33:42.104 --> 33:44.106
Yeah, you see,
we can't help ourselves.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.025
See, that's the sad
fucking lot of the Powers.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.280
It's gonna be your ruin.
It's gonna be my ruin.

33:51.989 --> 33:54.116
I tried to
explain that to Janice

33:54.199 --> 33:55.951
year and years
and years ago.

33:56.076 --> 33:59.204
You used your
Powers for good.
You wanted to help people.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.290
I don't know about all that.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.084
Matter of fact,
I don't know too much
about anything nowadays.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.713
Mister SuperShock?
I... I have to go.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.632
I just remembered
who I saw you with.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.635
Yeah? Walker.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.803
With Diamond?

34:14.928 --> 34:15.971
No.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.348
No, it was Morrison.

What...

34:31.111 --> 34:32.529
What did I... I'm sorry.

34:32.654 --> 34:33.822
You're gonna be
all right.

34:34.156 --> 34:35.741
I'm gonna put it back in.

Is it all right
if we wait here with you?

35:31.088 --> 35:33.840
You know, Walt used to
bring his daughters here.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.054
One day he asked me
if he could make
a cartoon about me.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.724
And I said, you know,
you already got
that little mouse.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.226
What do you need me for?

around for a long time.

Yeah, too long.
Some people think.

35:52.734 --> 35:53.735
Me especially.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.904
You must be tired.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.449
Honey, you have no idea.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.577
That's why we're here, Sir.
To help.

36:04.246 --> 36:05.789
How're you gonna do that?

36:06.873 --> 36:08.000
We're Powers.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.171
We came to say
you don't have
to fight any more.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.926
We're ready to pick up
where you left off.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.720
If you'll let us.

36:24.099 --> 36:25.767
What are you
gonna call yourselves?

New Unity.

(LAUGHING)

36:36.111 --> 36:37.738
"New Unity."

36:38.989 --> 36:40.866
Can't you come up
with something
a little bit more original?

36:40.949 --> 36:42.868
We didn't mean
any disrespect by it, Sir.

36:42.951 --> 36:45.871
We just wanted to honor
what the original
Unity stood for.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.289
What you stood for.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.042
Well, you know,
I'll say one thing.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.336
You got a lot of moxie.

36:55.464 --> 36:56.715
I killed Hitler.

36:58.425 --> 36:59.676
With these two hands.

37:03.639 --> 37:07.100
I stood on top of
Mount Saint Helens
and stopped the lava flowing

37:07.184 --> 37:10.062
until that volcano
choked on itself.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.649
I have seen
things and done things

37:14.650 --> 37:16.109
that none of you
could ever imagine.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.738

put on your flying suits

37:20.322 --> 37:23.241
and turn into superheroes...

give it a try.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.329

37:27.454 --> 37:29.456
being a Power,
it'll destroy you,

37:29.539 --> 37:30.999
eat you up inside,

The world is better off
without Powers, trust me.

So,

37:47.641 --> 37:49.518
I think you better
get out of my way.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.675
you're just broken.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.511
(SCREAMS)

39:06.595 --> 39:07.929
(BOOMING)

39:09.431 --> 39:10.932
WALKER:
That's enough, Patrick.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.187
Diamond,
I've been waiting for you.

39:16.313 --> 39:17.647
Did Janice send you?

39:21.902 --> 39:23.278
Yeah.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.698
Yeah, Janice sent me.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.870
She said to say sorry
she couldn't make it.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.332
Yeah, I was waiting
and then these kids showed up

39:35.457 --> 39:36.750
and I had to
take care of them.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.084
I know, right?
(CHUCKLES)

39:38.168 --> 39:39.628
Fucking young Powers.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.589
Always trying
to make a name
for themselves.

39:42.672 --> 39:43.840
Yeah.

39:44.633 --> 39:48.136
They wanna fight the
top dog and they think
they know everything.

39:48.261 --> 39:49.346
Like you once.

39:49.471 --> 39:50.472
Yeah, shit...

39:50.597 --> 39:53.266
You couldn't
teach me anything, could you?

39:53.350 --> 39:54.893
I was a cocky son of a bitch.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.978
I think you
turned out all right.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.438
Yeah.

39:59.815 --> 40:02.108
Morrison's done something
with Janice, hasn't he?

40:03.318 --> 40:04.778
Ah, shit, man.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.739
This all has to end.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.908
No, no, no. Patrick!

40:10.492 --> 40:12.327
Patrick. Pat...

40:12.452 --> 40:14.162
(LAUGHING)

40:14.246 --> 40:15.330
Patrick!

40:16.748 --> 40:18.166
(THUNDER BOOMING)

40:21.837 --> 40:23.004
(GRUNTS)
No, Patrick.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.422
There's no other choice

40:24.506 --> 40:28.343
as long as Morrison
is on this
god-forsaken earth.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.428
The apes can't
hide him forever.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.389
I've tried to be
a good steward.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.599
I can't protect
them from themselves.

40:34.683 --> 40:36.142
They all deserve to die.

40:36.226 --> 40:37.602
Janice would not want this...

40:37.686 --> 40:39.020
She's dead.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.397
Janice is dead.

40:40.522 --> 40:43.358
The apes killed her.
They murdered her.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.026
They're all gonna die now.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.403
I killed her.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.284
I'm not Diamond.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.493
I'm Morrison.

40:53.577 --> 40:55.620
I've been here the whole time.

40:55.704 --> 40:58.874
Pretending to be Diamond,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.252
so I could get close
to everybody you love.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.715
See, that's how
I killed Cobalt Knight.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.009
And it's how I
killed Retro Girl.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.219
What are you gonna do?

41:11.303 --> 41:12.804
How many times
have you tried to kill me,

41:12.888 --> 41:14.723
and I always come back?

41:15.557 --> 41:16.892
I will never

41:17.392 --> 41:18.560
ever

41:19.060 --> 41:21.313
stop coming after you.

41:21.396 --> 41:25.275
The only way that this ends
is when we're both dead.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.819
If that's what it takes.

41:27.903 --> 41:30.113
What are you going to do?
Fly us both into the sun?

41:30.906 --> 41:32.449
Sacrifice yourself?

41:32.574 --> 41:35.076
We both know
you don't have that in you.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.786
And you never did.

41:36.912 --> 41:38.830
And you can't stop
me any other way.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.374
(GRUNTS)

41:46.546 --> 41:48.882
I don't know
what Janice ever saw in you.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.602
Details are still
emerging regarding

42:00.685 --> 42:02.771
SuperShock's deadly rampage,

42:02.854 --> 42:04.397
but the facts are these.

42:04.481 --> 42:07.525
JPL has confirmed
SuperShock was the source

42:07.609 --> 42:10.570
of the unnatural
disaster that
occurred earlier today.

42:14.449 --> 42:17.202
He attacked and nearly killed

42:17.285 --> 42:20.288
Detective Deena Pilgrim
of Powers Division.

42:20.372 --> 42:24.292
Her partner, Detective Walker,
is missing and presumed dead,

42:24.417 --> 42:26.670
also at SuperShock's hand.

42:26.795 --> 42:30.298
And we anticipate
the death toll will
only continue to rise.

42:31.049 --> 42:34.636
Powers Division still
refuses to comment on
the mysterious death

42:34.719 --> 42:39.975
of Morrison,
the criminal mastermind,
also known as "The Ghost".

42:41.393 --> 42:44.646
Retro Girl lied to us.

42:44.729 --> 42:48.984
Our greatest hero was
directly responsible for
covering up murders

42:49.109 --> 42:53.029
committed by
another so-called hero,
SuperShock.

42:53.154 --> 42:56.741
We trusted Retro Girl.
We trusted her
to keep us safe.

43:03.331 --> 43:06.584
Let me be clear.
Powers are dangerous.

43:06.668 --> 43:09.879
Whatever perceived
benefits society may reap,

43:10.005 --> 43:11.506
we will sow
nothing but our own

43:11.631 --> 43:13.133
destruction if we
trust them again.

43:13.717 --> 43:17.470
Which is why
Congress has convened
an emergency session

43:17.554 --> 43:21.349
to bring Senator
Brown's anti-Powers
legislation back to the floor.

43:21.975 --> 43:25.562
A bill that,
if passed, will make the
use of powers illegal.

43:25.895 --> 43:28.523
This legislation will
change the course of history.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.735
To which I can only say this.
They have my vote.

43:32.485 --> 43:35.071
The age of Powers is over.

43:35.196 --> 43:38.533
As of today,
Retro Girl is truly dead.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.326
And in a world without heroes,

43:41.286 --> 43:42.912
we must protect ourselves.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.397
(MONITORS BEEPING)

44:10.356 --> 44:11.524
(GASPS)

44:11.608 --> 44:13.026
Walker...

44:46.392 --> 44:48.311
MAN: Interesting, no?

44:48.436 --> 44:50.438
WOMAN:
They're all interesting.

44:50.522 --> 44:53.274
MAN: But this one
in particular, I think.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.819
WOMAN: How long have you
been observing him?

44:55.944 --> 44:57.570
MAN: Ten iterations.

44:57.654 --> 45:00.698
I really do think
he'd be an ideal candidate.

45:00.782 --> 45:02.158
WOMAN: Perhaps.

45:02.283 --> 45:05.620
I shall bring it
to the full council
for further review.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.580
MAN: Of course.

45:07.664 --> 45:11.376
WOMAN: In the meantime,
put him through
the level two trials.

45:11.459 --> 45:13.962
Let's see what
he's truly made of.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.255
MAN: As you wish.

45:15.338 --> 45:16.923
(SCREAMING)
