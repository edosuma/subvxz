02:20.918 --> 02:24.001
I found Father Carlton this morning.

02:24.084 --> 02:28.501
He was taken to the hospital,
but he never regained consciousness.

02:28.584 --> 02:30.168
Why was he here?

02:30.251 --> 02:33.959
He had an appointment with
His Eminence this afternoon.

04:42.209 --> 04:44.834
Let's talk about our beliefs

04:44.918 --> 04:47.043
and what we can learn about them.

04:47.126 --> 04:50.751
We believe nature is solid

04:50.834 --> 04:53.043
and time a constant.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.168
Matter has substance
and time a direction.

04:57.251 --> 05:00.293
There is truth in flesh, huh,

05:00.376 --> 05:02.376
and the solid ground.

05:02.459 --> 05:05.543
The wind may be invisible, but it's real.

05:05.626 --> 05:10.918
Smoke, fire, water, light...
they're different.

05:11.001 --> 05:15.709
Not as to stone nor steel,
but they're tangible.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.126
And we assume time has an arrow,

05:18.209 --> 05:20.709
because it is as a clock.

05:20.793 --> 05:23.418
One second is one second for everyone.

05:23.501 --> 05:26.459
Cause precedes effect.

05:26.543 --> 05:30.209
Fruit rots, water flows downstream.

05:30.293 --> 05:33.084
We're born, we age, we die.

05:33.168 --> 05:35.251
The reverse never happens.

05:35.334 --> 05:39.501
None of this is true.
Say goodbye to classical reality,

05:39.584 --> 05:43.584
because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level

05:43.668 --> 05:47.043
into ghosts and shadows.

08:36.001 --> 08:38.418
From Job's friends insisting

08:38.501 --> 08:41.708
that the good are rewarded
and the wicked punished,

08:41.793 --> 08:43.751
to the scientists of the 1930s

08:43.833 --> 08:48.501
proving to their horror a theorem
that not everything can be proved,

08:48.584 --> 08:51.876
we've sought to impose
order on the universe.

08:51.959 --> 08:55.459
But we have discovered
something very surprising.

08:55.543 --> 08:59.043
While order does exist in the universe,

08:59.126 --> 09:02.584
it is not at all what we had in mind.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.918
Professor Birack, in relativity,

09:05.001 --> 09:07.959
geometry breaks down on the cosmic
scale and in quantum physics,

09:08.043 --> 09:11.084
logic breaks down
on the sub-microscopic scale...

09:30.543 --> 09:33.376
- What's this?
- I don't know.

09:33.459 --> 09:36.126
Birack did that whole series of debates
on the BBC a few years ago.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.251
Oh, with the English priest. Right.

09:38.334 --> 09:40.501
Maybe they're planning another one.

10:17.126 --> 10:21.501
He died before his appointment
with the Cardinal,

10:21.584 --> 10:23.584
but he left a diary.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.251
You... you must help us.

10:33.418 --> 10:34.793
Please.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.751
<i>The discovery of this supernova</i>

11:04.834 --> 11:07.751
<i>has immense significance
to the scientific community.</i>

11:07.834 --> 11:10.668
<i>Particles collected date
from pre-Cambrian times,</i>

11:10.751 --> 11:13.293
<i>before man walked on Earth.</i>

11:13.376 --> 11:15.543
<i>Light from the explosion
was hurled through space</i>

11:15.626 --> 11:18.668
<i>at 186, 000 miles per second,</i>

11:18.751 --> 11:23.293
<i>and is just now reaching us
across the vast expanse of the universe.</i>

12:07.959 --> 12:10.251
He was the guardian priest.

12:10.334 --> 12:13.001
Apparently, he lived here
for over 30 years.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.543
Once a week,
he would venture out for food.

12:18.209 --> 12:20.376
And every day,

12:20.459 --> 12:22.959
he opened this door.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.668
Built in the 1500s...

12:49.751 --> 12:52.043
by arrangement
with the Spanish government.

12:52.126 --> 12:56.168
- Who knew about this?
- Only the members of this forgotten sect.

12:56.251 --> 12:58.709
The Brotherhood of Sleep.

12:58.793 --> 13:02.001
There was a vow of silence.

13:02.084 --> 13:06.543
Even their very existence
was kept from the Holy See.

13:06.626 --> 13:09.209
The Vatican didn't know?

13:09.293 --> 13:12.293
The guardian priest
would keep the secret

13:12.376 --> 13:15.376
and before he died
would pass it on to another.

13:15.459 --> 13:18.709
The sect had enormous
power and authority.

13:18.793 --> 13:21.168
Their actions were never questioned.

14:18.293 --> 14:21.668
- Latin.
- Some of it's in Latin.

14:21.751 --> 14:24.293
Some in Coptic...

14:24.376 --> 14:27.584
Greek, numbers.

14:27.668 --> 14:29.584
It's not easy to decipher.

14:29.668 --> 14:34.626
The original text has been
distorted over the years.

14:34.709 --> 14:37.043
- Distorted?
- Rewritten.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.168
Writing upon writing,

14:39.251 --> 14:41.584
sometimes two or three times,

14:41.668 --> 14:44.209
and improperly erased.

14:44.293 --> 14:47.001
You can still see the old writing...

14:47.084 --> 14:48.751
underneath.

14:49.876 --> 14:51.584
What is it?

14:54.543 --> 14:58.418
A secret that can no longer be kept.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.959
- Do you feel it?
- Yes. Something.

15:05.043 --> 15:07.751
It was never here before.

15:07.834 --> 15:11.084
- It started a month ago.
- What started?

15:11.168 --> 15:14.209
A change in the Earth...

15:14.293 --> 15:16.376
and the sky.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.959
His power.

15:21.043 --> 15:23.043
- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

15:23.126 --> 15:25.834
- The whole thing. It doesn't make sense.
- It violates common sense.

15:25.918 --> 15:27.959
That's the whole point.
That's what Einstein couldn't accept.

15:28.043 --> 15:29.626
I can't accept it either.

15:29.709 --> 15:32.751
Do you know anything about
spontaneous human combustion?

15:32.834 --> 15:34.709
Walter, come on.
That's Schrodinger's cat.

15:34.793 --> 15:36.418
- I know, I know.
- So what's the point?

15:36.501 --> 15:38.876
The point is, until the cat
is observed by someone,

15:38.959 --> 15:41.959
he's not in any definite state,
either alive or dead.

15:42.043 --> 15:45.043
He's in a wave superposition state,
both dead and alive at the same time.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.459
- Huh?
- Okay.

15:46.543 --> 15:49.459
Only when we open the box
and observe the cat

15:49.543 --> 15:52.626
does he materialise into reality,
either dead or alive.

15:52.709 --> 15:55.876
- But it doesn't make sense.
- That is the entire, complete point.

15:55.959 --> 15:58.209
It doesn't make any common sense.

15:58.293 --> 16:00.709
Our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.918
Why do I want a PhD in this?

16:03.001 --> 16:04.918
Particle beam weapons, research grants.

16:05.001 --> 16:07.668
A millionaire when I'm 40.
Now I remember.

16:11.793 --> 16:14.418
- You're really gonna like this.
- Class cancelled?

16:14.501 --> 16:17.084
"Will the following students
please see Professor Birack."

16:17.168 --> 16:18.876
- Shit, there I am.
- Me too.

16:18.959 --> 16:22.168
No, all of us. And we heard Birack wants
us to cancel our plans for the weekend.

16:22.251 --> 16:23.626
- What?
- That's not all.

16:23.709 --> 16:25.751
A couple of biochemistry's
finest are coming with us.

16:25.834 --> 16:28.043
- And someone to translate Latin.
- Coming with us where?

16:28.126 --> 16:31.376
This is just not gonna happen!
I have serious plans for the weekend.

16:31.459 --> 16:34.334
Four o'clock, Walter, Birack's office.
Oh, I gotta ditch Pagels again.

16:34.418 --> 16:37.168
- He's not gonna like it.
- Well, sleep with him. Get an "A".

16:38.168 --> 16:41.251
- So what about your plans?
- I was gonna study, actually.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.793
Me too. I'm Brian Marsh, by the way,

16:43.876 --> 16:45.876
since we're spending
the weekend together.

16:45.959 --> 16:49.459
I know. Catherine Danforth.

16:49.543 --> 16:51.043
I know.

16:53.043 --> 16:55.168
So where did you transfer from?

16:55.251 --> 16:57.793
Kneale. Theoretical physics.

16:57.876 --> 17:01.209
I came here to study with Birack.
You're applied physics, right?

17:01.293 --> 17:03.584
So why are you taking Birack for theory?

17:03.668 --> 17:05.751
I wanna know what the math means.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.751
Birack's ruthless.
He wants philosophers, not scientists.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.917
Well, I've read his books.
He's a brilliant man.

17:12.001 --> 17:16.959
Just when I think I've got it,
visualised it, it just all goes away.

17:17.042 --> 17:20.084
I start seeing old-fashioned
classical reality again.

17:20.167 --> 17:23.542
I want the clock put back.
I wanna put it all into a little box.

17:23.626 --> 17:27.501
But whenever I try,
it just, uh, slithers out.

17:28.584 --> 17:31.418
Some things aren't changed
by quantum physics though.

17:31.501 --> 17:34.918
- Such as?
- Well, for instance,

17:35.001 --> 17:39.668
every theoretical physicist
I know wonders why it is

17:39.751 --> 17:42.084
that no one who looks like you

17:42.168 --> 17:46.751
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.834
That's not true and that's
an extremely sexist thing to say.

17:50.918 --> 17:53.376
Confirmed sexist and proud of it.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.834
Hey. I was just joking.

18:01.751 --> 18:03.501
What happened?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.418
You talk numbers, you get romantic.

18:07.501 --> 18:09.918
You talk people, you clam up.

18:12.918 --> 18:15.668
Just a little miscue, that's all.

18:15.751 --> 18:17.668
It's not your fault.

18:19.251 --> 18:22.084
I'm sorry. I'll see you later.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.959
Hey, wait.

18:27.543 --> 18:30.584
This conversation isn't what
I had in mind. Can we start over?

18:33.751 --> 18:35.209
Okay.

18:35.293 --> 18:37.084
Okay.

18:37.168 --> 18:39.084
I was hoping that you would need
some help with your theory,

18:39.168 --> 18:41.459
and that maybe we could discuss it

18:41.543 --> 18:45.209
over... over dinner or something.

18:46.751 --> 18:50.001
Well, I suppose
something could be arranged.

18:50.084 --> 18:55.126
There are other things
that I need help with... over dinner.

18:56.293 --> 19:00.001
I have volunteered our services
to the Archdiocese.

19:00.084 --> 19:02.334
Now, each of you
is a competent physicist,

19:02.418 --> 19:05.084
even though you don't have
a degree to prove it.

19:05.168 --> 19:07.709
Participating in this examination

19:07.793 --> 19:11.376
will greatly improve your
classroom averages, I might add.

19:12.709 --> 19:14.709
Plan to take your meals there.

19:14.793 --> 19:17.293
We'll bring cots to sleep on.

19:17.376 --> 19:21.209
- There are other departments joining us.
- Excuse me, sir.

19:21.293 --> 19:24.334
Is there some reason why you're not
telling us what we're gonna be doing?

19:26.293 --> 19:27.793
In time.

20:05.126 --> 20:07.709
It's your disbelief that powers him.

20:07.793 --> 20:10.334
Your stubborn faith in...

20:10.418 --> 20:12.959
in common sense...

20:13.043 --> 20:15.584
that allows his deception.

20:16.918 --> 20:20.334
He lives in the smallest parts of it...

20:21.709 --> 20:23.709
in the atoms.

20:23.793 --> 20:25.209
Smaller.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.418
Invisible.

20:31.876 --> 20:34.376
He lives in all of it...

20:35.751 --> 20:38.293
in the sum of its parts.

20:41.043 --> 20:43.876
We must translate this book.

20:43.959 --> 20:46.501
You must prove it scientifically.

20:47.501 --> 20:49.501
Convince the outside world.

20:49.584 --> 20:52.751
The outside world doesn't want
to hear this kind of bullshit.

20:53.793 --> 20:55.793
Just keep it locked away.

20:55.876 --> 20:58.834
You've already managed that
for 2,000 years.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.584
No prison can hold him now.

21:15.501 --> 21:17.876
- Hi.
- HI.

21:17.959 --> 21:21.709
It's getting cold out here. I thought
this was supposed to be California.

21:23.043 --> 21:25.543
- Did you have a class tonight, or...?
- Library.

21:25.626 --> 21:26.751
Oh.

21:26.834 --> 21:30.043
Actually, I was hoping you'd
have a cup of coffee with me again.

21:31.626 --> 21:34.001
This is starting to become a habit.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.334
Okay.

21:35.418 --> 21:36.751
Okay.

22:32.959 --> 22:34.376
Good morning.

22:35.501 --> 22:37.001
Thank you.

22:42.001 --> 22:44.626
- We didn't get much sleep.
- Mm-hm.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.501
Who needs sleep?

22:49.001 --> 22:51.043
We do. Today's Friday.

22:52.043 --> 22:54.334
Can I tell you something?

22:54.418 --> 22:56.668
- Oh, please, don't.
- I want to.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.543
Tell me next time...

23:00.626 --> 23:02.668
if there is one.

23:02.751 --> 23:04.959
Or the time after that, or...

23:06.168 --> 23:08.209
two years from now.

23:09.793 --> 23:12.001
Who was he?

23:12.084 --> 23:15.126
The one who gave you
such a high opinion of men?

23:17.168 --> 23:20.918
I wouldn't like it if either of us
jumped to conclusions.

23:21.001 --> 23:24.584
How do you know I was going to say
what you think I was gonna say?

23:25.584 --> 23:27.293
Because if you don't...

23:28.501 --> 23:30.543
I don't wanna know.

25:01.418 --> 25:03.543
Oh, please, don't tell me.

25:03.626 --> 25:06.626
- This place gives me the creeps.
- Well, it was abandoned.

25:06.709 --> 25:08.626
Hmm. I never would've guessed.

25:08.709 --> 25:11.043
- I hear it used to be a beautiful church.
- When?

25:11.126 --> 25:14.376
In the 1950s. My husband's
parents used to come here.

25:14.459 --> 25:17.459
And then for some reason,
it was closed down.

25:17.543 --> 25:19.501
- Well!
- Yeah.

25:19.584 --> 25:20.876
Hmm.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.376
Hi. I'm, uh, Leahy.
I'm looking for Birack.

25:29.459 --> 25:32.626
Hi. Brian Marsh.
He's over in... There he is.

25:32.709 --> 25:34.543
Ah. Thanks.

25:46.793 --> 25:48.418
- Professor Birack.
- Yes.

25:48.501 --> 25:51.043
- Hi. I'm Paul Leahy.
- Oh. Dr Leahy.

25:51.126 --> 25:53.334
I'm glad you could come. Yes.

25:53.418 --> 25:55.459
Well, all I really know about
what's going on here is

25:55.543 --> 25:57.501
what one of your students
told me on the telephone.

25:57.584 --> 26:01.043
We're just getting organised. If you have
some equipment, find a spot over there.

26:01.126 --> 26:03.918
- All right.
- We're making this the central lab.

26:04.001 --> 26:08.584
Sure. Well, what are we
actually doing here?

26:13.293 --> 26:16.084
You're the only one with any brains
getting out of here at night.

26:16.168 --> 26:20.668
Well, I gotta cover for Leahy over
the weekend. Extra credit seminar. Wow.

26:23.834 --> 26:25.918
- Hi, Frank.
- Don't leave.

26:26.001 --> 26:29.209
Excuse me. I have to set up.

26:29.293 --> 26:31.793
- Hi.
- Hello!

26:31.876 --> 26:34.251
Frankie, who's that?

26:34.334 --> 26:37.501
Susan Cabot. Radiologist. Married.

26:37.584 --> 26:39.793
- Ah. How married?
- Very.

26:39.876 --> 26:41.834
- Oh. Hi, Doc.
- Hi. I'll be working upstairs.

26:41.918 --> 26:43.876
I want you to set up
the basic panel down here.

26:43.959 --> 26:46.793
Right. What are you
supposed to be testing?

26:46.876 --> 26:49.251
- I don't know.
- Compounds? Basic structures?

26:49.334 --> 26:52.293
When I know, you'll know.
Uh, Leahy.

26:54.001 --> 26:56.459
- Great.
- Science marches on.

26:56.543 --> 26:58.209
Yeah.

26:59.959 --> 27:01.959
- Need any help?
- No, I'm okay.

27:02.043 --> 27:05.584
There better be a diploma in my mailbox
when I get home on Monday.

27:22.751 --> 27:25.043
I really can't believe this is happening.
I had a date tonight

27:25.126 --> 27:27.459
with this beautiful young trial attorney
from Century City.

27:27.543 --> 27:30.209
- Where were you taking him?
- Please, it isn't funny!

27:33.668 --> 27:37.543
- What are they doing?
- They're watching us.

27:37.626 --> 27:40.376
They started coming around when I got here
at nine o'clock this morning.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.918
- I'm Calder. Microbiology.
- Brian Marsh.

27:43.001 --> 27:44.418
- Walter.
- Lomax.

27:44.501 --> 27:46.001
- Engineering.
- Biochemistry.

27:46.084 --> 27:47.751
- Nice to meet you.
- Lomax.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.626
How you doing?

27:49.709 --> 27:51.793
So anybody know what
this whole deal's about yet?

27:51.876 --> 27:54.084
- Not a clue.
- Nobody's got a clue.

27:56.251 --> 27:58.834
I'm getting my doctorate in theology.

27:58.918 --> 28:01.501
Analysis of ancient scriptures.

28:01.584 --> 28:05.584
This shouldn't be too difficult,
except for the numbers.

28:55.251 --> 28:58.709
It's so wonderful
what you're doing, Father,

28:58.793 --> 29:01.834
opening the church again.

29:20.043 --> 29:22.418
Are you all right?

29:22.501 --> 29:24.501
We're ready.

30:04.376 --> 30:06.751
He's gaining strength.

30:07.834 --> 30:11.418
I can feel it all around us now.

30:53.626 --> 30:55.709
So what's going on?

30:58.709 --> 31:01.001
Something downstairs.

31:01.084 --> 31:02.751
Yeah? What?

31:03.834 --> 31:08.376
I hate to tell you guys,
but this is real bullshit.

31:23.459 --> 31:26.793
I know there's a reason why
nobody's opened this thing yet, right?

31:27.793 --> 31:29.626
Let me have your pen for a second.

31:30.751 --> 31:34.084
- Is this some kind of toxic crap?
- Could be.

31:34.168 --> 31:37.959
Okay, but I still don't understand
why we're not taking direct samples.

31:38.043 --> 31:40.668
I mean, what's the big mystery?

31:50.709 --> 31:54.376
Catherine's entering these equations
upstairs. They're translated from Latin.

31:54.459 --> 31:56.334
Differential equations?

31:56.418 --> 31:58.168
From a book written 2,000 years ago.

31:58.251 --> 31:59.959
We hadn't invented
differential equations...

32:00.043 --> 32:01.459
Right.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.293
Professor Birack, I don't think
we have too much to worry about.

32:53.376 --> 32:56.209
The lid on that thing won't open. Look.

32:56.293 --> 32:58.209
It's incredibly elaborate.

32:58.293 --> 33:01.501
Right here, there's a...
there's a weird locking mechanism.

33:01.584 --> 33:04.459
Looks like it can only
be opened from the inside.

33:51.876 --> 33:54.084
<i>Ha-ha-ha-ha!</i>

33:54.168 --> 33:56.376
<i>Ha-ha-ha-ha!</i>

34:03.543 --> 34:05.959
I'm going back.

34:06.043 --> 34:07.543
Look at this.

34:10.708 --> 34:14.251
Now, a friend of mine at UCLA
did a study of chronic schizophrenics.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.958
They're supposed to have
stereotyped routines that they repeat

34:17.043 --> 34:18.876
every 20 minutes or so.

34:18.958 --> 34:22.918
Like a stuck record in their brains
repeating the same phrase over and over.

34:23.001 --> 34:25.918
Well, I have been watching them
on and off all day,

34:26.001 --> 34:27.876
and they don't seem
to be making any movements.

34:27.958 --> 34:30.626
- They just stand there.
- With those kinds of problems,

34:30.708 --> 34:33.708
- let them stand there if they want to.
- Ooh!

34:33.793 --> 34:36.501
You okay?

34:36.583 --> 34:38.668
Yeah. I bumped into something
this afternoon.

34:38.751 --> 34:40.876
- It's starting to hurt.
- Probably nerves.

34:40.958 --> 34:43.376
It's a bruise, Walter.
You don't bruise from nerves.

34:43.458 --> 34:47.918
I used to break out when I was 12.
Doctor said it was homosexual panic.

34:55.376 --> 34:57.834
- Ah, I'll see you Monday morning.
- You got anything for me?

34:57.918 --> 35:01.709
No, I'm afraid not. I'm guessing on the
acidity based upon the corrosion samples.

35:01.793 --> 35:03.418
- The figures you gave me.
- Yeah.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.626
- Well, it can't be that high.
- I know, but you asked me to guess.

35:05.709 --> 35:07.626
- All right, get outta here.
- Goodnight, sir.

35:07.709 --> 35:11.584
- Hey, what's with the "sir" business?
- Okay, goodnight, Sir Doc.

35:11.668 --> 35:14.001
Better. A lot better.

35:37.668 --> 35:39.668
My God!

36:24.834 --> 36:27.043
Aaagh!

36:27.918 --> 36:29.543
Aaagh!

36:51.793 --> 36:54.293
- Look, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes.

36:54.376 --> 36:56.584
Nobody's really saying
much of anything here.

36:56.668 --> 36:59.751
We're getting to the first round of tests
and nobody's stopped since we got here.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.626
Get to the point.

37:01.709 --> 37:06.334
Nothing anywhere ever is supposed
to be able to do what it is doing.

37:06.418 --> 37:09.334
Now, settle down now.
Go back to work.

37:09.418 --> 37:12.709
A lifeform is growing
out of pre-biotic fluid.

37:12.793 --> 37:16.126
It's not winding down into disorder.
It's self-organising.

37:16.209 --> 37:19.626
It's becoming something. What?

37:19.709 --> 37:22.209
I mean, an animal? A disease? What?

37:23.959 --> 37:29.168
The hardest thing to hear for any of us
is something we don't agree with.

37:32.793 --> 37:36.501
"I saw a star fall from heaven
unto the bottomless pit,

37:36.584 --> 37:39.959
and he was cast out
as water from the flood..."

37:46.793 --> 37:48.918
This is crazy.

38:13.126 --> 38:15.334
- Man.
- Hadn't you seen it yet?

38:15.418 --> 38:20.168
No. For the last four hours, I've been
carbon dating the corrosion on the lid.

38:20.251 --> 38:22.959
We're talking about seven million years.

38:23.043 --> 38:24.709
- What?
- Yeah.

38:26.459 --> 38:29.043
I'm going topside.

38:30.293 --> 38:33.543
- Want me to wait for you?
- No, uh-uh. Go on.

39:21.043 --> 39:24.293
This whole section's a kind of history.
Part of it was indecipherable,

39:24.376 --> 39:27.334
as if someone were deliberately
trying to erase it.

39:27.418 --> 39:31.043
I managed to piece together most of it.
Okay, it kind of starts here.

39:31.126 --> 39:35.376
"The container was buried somewhere
in the Middle East eons ago by..."

39:35.459 --> 39:38.918
It gets a little wild here...
"the father of Satan,

39:39.001 --> 39:41.668
"a god who once walked the Earth
before man...

39:41.751 --> 39:44.459
but was somehow banished
to the dark side."

39:44.543 --> 39:47.584
Apparently, the father
buried his son inside the container.

39:47.668 --> 39:50.376
This was the section
someone was trying to erase.

39:50.459 --> 39:53.168
Now later on here,
"Christ comes to warn us.

39:53.251 --> 39:58.501
He was of extra-terrestrial ancestry,
but a human-like race."

40:19.209 --> 40:21.334
Uhhh!

40:46.251 --> 40:47.293
Uhh!

41:00.126 --> 41:03.959
Finally, they determine Christ is crazy,
but he's also gaining power

41:04.043 --> 41:07.376
converting a lot of people to his beliefs,
so they kill him.

41:07.459 --> 41:10.626
But his disciples keep the secret
and hide it from civilisation

41:10.709 --> 41:13.418
until man could develop a science
sophisticated enough

41:13.501 --> 41:15.334
to prove what Christ was saying.

41:15.418 --> 41:18.293
Something like this can really
fuck up your weekend.

41:18.376 --> 41:23.001
How did the Roman Catholic Church manage
to keep this a secret for 2,000 years?

41:23.084 --> 41:25.334
Apparently, a decision was made...

41:25.418 --> 41:29.001
to characterise pure evil
as a spiritual force,

41:29.084 --> 41:32.793
even within the darkness
in the hearts of men.

41:34.293 --> 41:36.459
It was more convenient.

41:36.543 --> 41:40.043
In that way, man remained
at the centre of things.

41:40.126 --> 41:43.084
A stupid lie.
We were salesmen, that's all.

41:43.168 --> 41:46.626
We sold our product...

41:46.709 --> 41:49.543
to those who didn't have it.

41:49.626 --> 41:51.543
The new life.

41:52.751 --> 41:55.834
Reward ourselves,
punish our enemies...

41:55.918 --> 41:59.876
so we can live without truth.

41:59.959 --> 42:01.376
A substance.

42:02.501 --> 42:04.584
Malevolence.

42:04.668 --> 42:06.834
That was the truth.

42:06.918 --> 42:09.084
Asleep...

42:09.168 --> 42:11.251
until now.

42:19.334 --> 42:23.043
Help me break this up.
The others shouldn't hear this.

42:24.751 --> 42:28.584
Faith is a hard thing to come
by these days. Look at this.

42:31.084 --> 42:34.334
That thing down there just directed
a fairly sizable burst of energy.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.626
Directed?

42:36.709 --> 42:40.543
In a straight line, with the precision
of less than a millisecond.

42:42.543 --> 42:45.584
Everybody's acting like we should
really be taking this seriously.

42:46.834 --> 42:49.584
You two aren't taking
this seriously, are you?

43:04.626 --> 43:08.584
What are we supposed to do?
Just go back to work?

43:08.668 --> 43:10.959
What would you rather have,
a wreath of garlic?

43:11.043 --> 43:14.709
A benediction? A crucifix?

43:17.918 --> 43:22.209
Then it really is Old Scratch
knocking at the door.

43:22.293 --> 43:26.043
A few minutes ago, a vibration
was triggered on that thing downstairs.

43:26.126 --> 43:29.084
A strong one. Some kind of...

43:29.168 --> 43:32.043
kinetic emission came out of it.

43:32.126 --> 43:34.084
Now, if it can transmit
a signal strong enough...

43:34.168 --> 43:36.626
It can move other objects

43:36.709 --> 43:39.918
instantaneously across a distance.

43:40.001 --> 43:41.876
Without outside intervention.

43:41.959 --> 43:43.918
Psychokinesis.

43:45.084 --> 43:48.001
Mind-directed energy.

43:48.084 --> 43:51.751
- Don't tell the others yet.
- Why not?

43:51.834 --> 43:56.126
They have a right to know that this...
that it... it's conscious.

43:56.209 --> 43:58.543
Not until you prove
it wasn't something else...

43:58.626 --> 44:01.001
a power surge or a draft of air.

44:04.126 --> 44:05.584
All right.

44:26.418 --> 44:28.293
You missed the big history lesson.

44:33.043 --> 44:35.376
You're not gonna believe
what's been going on up here.

44:57.334 --> 44:58.834
Want one?

45:01.126 --> 45:03.709
Anyone ever tell you that
you could pass for Asian?

45:05.793 --> 45:07.209
Phew!

45:10.709 --> 45:13.543
- What was that all about?
- No sense of humour.

45:13.626 --> 45:15.459
- Have you seen Susan?
- Who?

45:15.543 --> 45:18.709
- Radiologist, glasses.
- Oh, yeah. She's right outside.

45:24.043 --> 45:25.126
Where?

45:34.626 --> 45:37.834
- She was there.
- I think somebody ought to tell her.

45:37.918 --> 45:41.459
Look, am I crazy or are we
stroking ourselves heavily here?

45:44.043 --> 45:46.751
Thank you for taking the time
to share your thoughts.

46:07.959 --> 46:09.793
Susan?

46:19.709 --> 46:21.501
There's more to it.

46:34.001 --> 46:38.168
There's some kind of power...
directed outward.

46:38.251 --> 46:40.459
A controlled force.

46:40.543 --> 46:44.626
- What's it doing?
- Reaching out.

46:44.709 --> 46:46.709
Influencing.

46:47.834 --> 46:49.668
Changing things.

46:52.543 --> 46:55.209
Moving objects by thought.

46:58.209 --> 47:00.418
Extraordinary intervention.

47:00.501 --> 47:03.418
An intelligent cause other than man.

47:10.376 --> 47:12.209
Susan?

47:13.876 --> 47:15.751
Hello?

48:14.084 --> 48:16.001
Suppose...

48:16.084 --> 48:19.626
what your faith has said
was essentially correct.

48:21.209 --> 48:25.668
Suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything.

48:25.751 --> 48:30.501
A god willing the behaviour
of every subatomic particle.

48:31.626 --> 48:36.251
Now, every particle has an anti-particle.

48:36.334 --> 48:39.334
Its mirror image.

48:39.418 --> 48:41.876
Its negative side.

48:41.959 --> 48:45.668
Maybe this universal mind

48:45.751 --> 48:50.293
resides in the mirror image
instead of in our universe,

48:50.376 --> 48:52.793
as we wanted to believe.

48:54.709 --> 48:57.334
Maybe he's anti-God,

48:57.418 --> 48:59.876
bringing darkness instead of light.

48:59.959 --> 49:02.834
Why weren't we told the truth?

49:02.918 --> 49:06.626
Without the technology to confirm,

49:06.709 --> 49:09.168
it would have been another legend.

49:09.251 --> 49:11.959
But he was our prisoner, not yours!

49:13.501 --> 49:16.043
We had a responsibility

49:16.126 --> 49:18.584
to warn the rest of the world.

49:19.626 --> 49:22.834
Only the corrupt
are listened to now,

49:22.918 --> 49:26.376
and they tell us
what we want to hear.

49:28.209 --> 49:31.543
We believe it to be divine light.

49:34.501 --> 49:36.626
It just got colder in here.

49:36.709 --> 49:38.918
I know.

49:39.001 --> 49:41.459
Suddenly, as if...

49:41.543 --> 49:44.293
as if something...

49:44.376 --> 49:47.084
moved through the room.

49:56.126 --> 49:57.959
Listen, do you realise
what's going on up there?

49:58.043 --> 50:00.293
We are on the brink
of the ultimate truth!

50:00.376 --> 50:02.501
Oh, this priest is a real case.

50:02.584 --> 50:06.709
He is looney tunes, and I'm
beginning to wonder about Birack too.

50:06.793 --> 50:09.418
I'm going back. Come on, Calder.

50:09.501 --> 50:11.251
Come on, Frank!

50:12.501 --> 50:17.959
You're outta your minds!
This is a joke. This is caca.

50:21.668 --> 50:23.251
Come on!

50:28.334 --> 50:29.668
Caca.

51:16.793 --> 51:18.084
Ugh!

51:26.376 --> 51:27.459
Aagh!

51:33.668 --> 51:35.043
Aaagh!

51:37.418 --> 51:38.251
Aagh!

51:39.793 --> 51:41.459
Aagh! Aagh!

51:43.168 --> 51:45.334
Aaagh! Aaagh!

52:18.418 --> 52:19.584
Hello?

52:34.959 --> 52:38.668
- Where's Wyndham?
- Uh, he left.

52:40.334 --> 52:41.418
When?

52:42.418 --> 52:44.876
Oh, about 20 minutes ago.

52:44.959 --> 52:47.126
We tried to talk him
out of it, but, uh...

52:47.209 --> 52:50.043
- Has anyone seen Susan?
- Who?

52:50.126 --> 52:53.501
The radiologist. Glasses?

52:55.084 --> 52:57.001
Well, maybe she left too.

52:58.209 --> 53:00.501
Maybe they both had the right idea.

53:33.251 --> 53:37.668
<i>This is not a dream. Not a dream.</i>

53:37.751 --> 53:41.918
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

53:42.001 --> 53:45.626
<i>We are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro-interference.</i>

53:46.668 --> 53:50.168
<i>You are receiving
this broadcast as a dream.</i>

53:50.251 --> 53:52.959
<i>We are transmitting from the year 1-9...</i>

53:55.168 --> 53:56.793
- Uhh!
- Walter?

53:56.876 --> 53:58.668
- What?
- Have you seen Mullins?

53:58.751 --> 54:01.084
- What? No.
- Susan?

54:01.168 --> 54:03.126
- Who?
- Radiologist. Glasses.

54:03.209 --> 54:05.668
Come on, man! I was asleep.

54:05.751 --> 54:08.293
We can't find them. And Wyndham's left.

54:08.376 --> 54:10.918
Couple of the others
are talking about leaving.

54:11.001 --> 54:13.251
We're gonna have a meeting
in the lab in half an hour.

54:13.334 --> 54:15.376
- Mullins left?
- I don't know.

54:15.459 --> 54:17.793
I'm gonna go downstairs
and look for him.

54:20.543 --> 54:22.793
Well, since I'm up now.

54:45.126 --> 54:47.626
If I don't come back,
you can have my Porsche.

55:46.376 --> 55:49.001
<i>You are receiving this broadcast in order</i>

55:49.084 --> 55:51.709
<i>to alter the events you are seeing.</i>

55:51.793 --> 55:54.959
<i>Our technology has not developed
a transmitter strong enough</i>

55:55.043 --> 55:57.376
<i>to reach your conscious state
of awareness.</i>

55:57.459 --> 55:58.668
What?

56:01.668 --> 56:03.876
What were you dreaming?

56:04.876 --> 56:07.918
Your kingdom, Father,
does not include my unconscious.

56:09.334 --> 56:12.918
It's mine, and I may abuse it
any way I wish...

56:14.084 --> 56:16.626
without having to confess
what's in it.

56:18.043 --> 56:20.334
Something I haven't told you.

56:20.418 --> 56:24.126
The Brotherhood of Sleep...

56:24.209 --> 56:26.959
Anyone in close proximity...

56:27.043 --> 56:29.168
has the same dream.

56:30.251 --> 56:32.751
The one you had just now.

56:56.001 --> 56:57.334
Um...

56:57.418 --> 56:58.834
Excuse me, but I...

57:12.418 --> 57:16.126
The guardian priests
had the dream for years.

57:16.209 --> 57:18.418
What does it mean?

57:20.168 --> 57:22.751
A premonition.

57:22.834 --> 57:25.584
The dream evolves, unfolds.

57:25.668 --> 57:28.959
We shall start to have it
every time we go to sleep.

57:30.168 --> 57:33.334
As if it's pushing everything else out.

57:35.209 --> 57:37.834
Making room for itself.

57:39.376 --> 57:40.668
Mullins?

57:45.376 --> 57:47.751
Do you think he really just took off?

57:47.834 --> 57:50.834
I mean, like he was actually
believing this whole business?

57:51.834 --> 57:54.043
Why is everybody
looking at me that way?

57:54.126 --> 57:57.834
- Cos you're being asshole-ish.
- That's very asshole-ish of you to say.

57:57.918 --> 58:00.501
Look, Mullins is probably
off asleep someplace.

58:00.584 --> 58:03.418
Or he's boffing the radiologist.
I hope he's getting laid.

58:03.501 --> 58:06.918
I hope they're both on their way
to a nice Chinese restaurant.

58:30.543 --> 58:33.168
How can you keep working like this?

58:33.251 --> 58:35.293
It's... 3:30.

58:35.376 --> 58:37.709
No wonder I'm so tired.

58:37.793 --> 58:39.626
I keep getting these figures
in the computer,

58:39.709 --> 58:41.418
but they're not making any sense.

58:41.501 --> 58:43.959
I stopped making sense
about 15 minutes ago.

58:44.043 --> 58:46.793
No, I mean these equations
are beyond me now.

58:46.876 --> 58:49.918
- They're like another language.
- Mmm.

58:50.918 --> 58:53.709
Go get some sleep.
I'll wake you in half an hour.

58:53.793 --> 58:56.251
- Oh, 45 minutes?
- Okay.

58:57.459 --> 59:00.126
Hey, are you okay?

59:00.209 --> 59:03.001
No.

59:03.084 --> 59:05.209
I know what you mean.

59:05.293 --> 59:09.376
I just want to go home, pretend
none of this is really happening.

59:11.251 --> 59:14.251
- What's that?
- Hmm?

59:14.334 --> 59:17.001
Oh, it's just a bruise I got somehow.

59:18.001 --> 59:20.584
Finally stopped hurting.

59:21.793 --> 59:23.709
It looks like a figure of some kind.

59:23.793 --> 59:25.918
- No, I got to close my eyes.
- Okay.

59:26.001 --> 59:28.084
- I'll wake you.
- Thanks.

59:45.251 --> 59:46.584
Hello?

59:47.709 --> 59:51.751
I'm opening the door, if you want to stop
what you're doing and put your clothes on.

01:00:01.626 --> 01:00:04.418
Big doings in the lab tonight.
There's a meeting.

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.959
Oh, give me just 15 minutes.

01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:09.668
- You want me to come back?
- Later.

01:00:18.084 --> 01:00:20.209
- Any luck?
- Can't find anybody.

01:00:20.293 --> 01:00:23.251
- I'm going up to the lab.
- Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

01:00:26.626 --> 01:00:28.668
We're having a meeting in the lab.

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:30.168
Lisa!

01:00:32.376 --> 01:00:34.584
Mona Lisa!

01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:42.418
Lisa?

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:52.334
This whole building is gonna
have to be encased in concrete.

01:01:52.418 --> 01:01:55.501
No way. A building this size?
I say we launch the fucker into space.

01:01:55.584 --> 01:01:57.543
I'm hearing something.

01:02:21.918 --> 01:02:24.834
- Where are the others?
- We think they've left.

01:02:24.918 --> 01:02:27.126
Kelly's asleep.
I didn't want to wake her up.

01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:31.168
I'm asking you to stay.

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:34.126
The work that we do
in the next 48 hours is critical.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:37.918
How many of you have fallen asleep
tonight? Come on, please, tell me.

01:02:38.001 --> 01:02:40.668
Come on, please!

01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:46.168
You dreamed... You dreamed
about the front of this church.

01:02:47.293 --> 01:02:50.084
About a dark figure coming out.

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:55.001
Didn't you... Didn't you feel it?

01:02:56.501 --> 01:02:58.626
Not like a dream.

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:00.959
Like something else.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.418
Here.

01:03:04.668 --> 01:03:06.793
I had the dream too.

01:03:06.876 --> 01:03:11.918
This image of something that didn't
seem to belong to my subconscious.

01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:15.459
Almost if I was watching
something pre-recorded.

01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:18.084
- Tachyons?
- One possibility.

01:03:18.168 --> 01:03:22.418
- What's that?
- It's a Greek word.

01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:24.418
It means "swift one".

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:28.543
So what is the dream? Huh? Precognition?

01:03:28.626 --> 01:03:31.751
Previous knowledge of a future event?

01:03:32.959 --> 01:03:36.418
A shared vision of something
that is yet to occur?

01:03:36.501 --> 01:03:39.959
- Caused by that thing downstairs?
- Perhaps not.

01:03:40.043 --> 01:03:44.084
Tachyon is a subatomic particle
that travels faster than light.

01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.126
Supposing it isn't a dream.

01:03:46.209 --> 01:03:49.293
Supposing it's a message.

01:03:49.376 --> 01:03:53.209
What if these dreams,
premonitions, omens...

01:03:53.293 --> 01:03:55.751
What if they're really...

01:03:55.834 --> 01:03:59.043
visual messages sent
by other human beings?

01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:01.751
Photographs. Video signals.

01:04:01.834 --> 01:04:04.459
- From where?
- The future.

01:04:04.543 --> 01:04:07.418
Anything traveling faster
than the speed of light

01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:09.626
would appear to be
going backward in time.

01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:12.668
A future scientist calculates
the exact spot...

01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:14.959
that the Earth occupied
in space in the past,

01:04:15.043 --> 01:04:17.709
given trajectory and speed.

01:04:17.793 --> 01:04:20.584
He then beams a tachyon signal

01:04:20.668 --> 01:04:22.584
at that spot,

01:04:22.668 --> 01:04:26.751
transmitting video information
backwards through time.

01:04:26.834 --> 01:04:31.251
For us to receive as electrical
impulses, neural stimulus.

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:34.043
- Man, oh, man.
- For what purpose?

01:04:34.126 --> 01:04:36.001
Could be a warning.

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:38.709
To show us what's going to happen.

01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:41.084
A sort of...

01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:43.668
remote camera view of the future,

01:04:43.751 --> 01:04:46.209
so that we can change it.

01:04:57.251 --> 01:05:00.584
Someone has finally shown up to tell us.

01:05:02.126 --> 01:05:04.751
I think it's time we stood up
for what we are.

01:05:06.418 --> 01:05:09.418
I think there's something wrong with
this. I'm not getting anything now.

01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:11.543
It's gone dead.

01:05:14.418 --> 01:05:16.584
Maybe the generator's dead.

01:05:16.668 --> 01:05:19.876
No, it looks more like
the units downstairs were cut off.

01:05:26.668 --> 01:05:29.543
Hello? Hello?

01:05:30.918 --> 01:05:32.709
Hey, Wyndham!

01:05:34.876 --> 01:05:38.668
Hello? Hello?

01:05:41.418 --> 01:05:43.543
Come here. Look at this.

01:05:50.918 --> 01:05:54.209
I've got a message for you,

01:05:54.293 --> 01:05:56.959
and you're not going to like it.

01:05:57.043 --> 01:05:59.209
Look at his chest.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:06.584
Pray for death.

01:06:11.959 --> 01:06:14.043
Jesus Christ!

01:06:35.709 --> 01:06:41.584
♪ Amazing grace!

01:06:41.668 --> 01:06:47.418

no.

01:08:36.209 --> 01:08:37.626
Kelly?

01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:49.084
Agh!

01:09:58.876 --> 01:10:01.126
Hey. Hey, you guys!

01:10:01.209 --> 01:10:03.418
They got the back doors
blocked away there.

01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:05.959
- What the hell is happening here?
- What's going on?

01:10:06.043 --> 01:10:09.459
The back doors are blocked!
We can't get through the back door.

01:10:09.543 --> 01:10:12.626
You okay?
Have you checked the windows?

01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:28.668
What's going on here?

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.751
We can't get out of here!

01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.959
It's in here! Don't come in here!

01:10:35.043 --> 01:10:36.626
Aaagh!

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:37.626
Go, go, go!

01:11:38.751 --> 01:11:40.376
Lock the door!

01:11:42.043 --> 01:11:44.543
Come on! Get over here!

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:04.376
The sun's coming up.

01:14:52.626 --> 01:14:55.876
Normally, I love
being dominated by women.

01:14:57.501 --> 01:15:01.084
Lisa, I'm sorry about
what I said before.

01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:03.334
You don't look Asian at all.

01:15:07.918 --> 01:15:09.209
Shit.

01:15:10.376 --> 01:15:12.918
I thought I heard Walter.

01:15:20.668 --> 01:15:21.751
Walter?

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:23.959
Walter!

01:15:28.251 --> 01:15:31.418
- What the fuck do you want?
- Where are you?

01:15:31.501 --> 01:15:33.918
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

01:15:40.334 --> 01:15:43.209
Hey. Can you dig through
and get me out of here?

01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:49.709
- I don't know. The wall's pretty thick.
- Are you all right?

01:15:49.793 --> 01:15:52.584
Well, that's a relative
thing right now, but, yeah.

01:15:52.668 --> 01:15:54.584
Wait a second.

01:16:04.376 --> 01:16:07.418
They're just standing there outside.
Not trying to get in.

01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:09.751
They've stopped attacking for some reason.

01:16:09.834 --> 01:16:12.418
Hey, Walter, where are you, exactly?

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.668
I'm in this closet.

01:16:14.751 --> 01:16:17.376
I think we can
get through with this.

01:16:17.459 --> 01:16:19.709
It's gonna take a while.

01:16:19.793 --> 01:16:22.209
Walter, we're gonna
try and dig through.

01:16:22.293 --> 01:16:25.793
- How long will it take?
- A couple of hours.

01:16:25.876 --> 01:16:28.793
Oh, great. I'll tell you what.
I'll hang on here anyway.

01:17:38.418 --> 01:17:41.126
Well, get ready to pull me back.

01:17:53.334 --> 01:17:55.001
Come on, Brian!

01:17:55.084 --> 01:17:58.084
Get up here! Come on, Brian. Brian!

01:17:58.168 --> 01:17:59.918
- Come on! Come on, let's go!
- Now!

01:18:00.001 --> 01:18:03.168
Come on! Come up here.
Come on, man. Hurry up!

01:18:03.251 --> 01:18:06.126
- Come on! Come on, Brian.
- Hurry!

01:18:06.209 --> 01:18:09.918
Come on! Come on, Brian. Come on!

01:18:13.876 --> 01:18:16.043
Come on.

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:22.126
You guys seen any movies you like?

01:18:43.959 --> 01:18:45.584
All right.

01:18:45.668 --> 01:18:49.126
A Jewish mother goes to the airport
to meet her daughter.

01:18:49.209 --> 01:18:52.918
The daughter steps off the plane
with an eight-foot-tall Zulu warrior

01:18:53.001 --> 01:18:55.209
with a bone through his nose.

01:18:55.293 --> 01:19:00.168
The mother screams, "You fool!
I said a 'rich' doctor!

01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:14.501
<i>Not a dream.</i>

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:18.209
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

01:19:18.293 --> 01:19:23.043
<i>We are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro-interference.</i>

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:27.043
<i>You are receiving this broadcast
as a dream.</i>

01:19:27.126 --> 01:19:30.793
<i>We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9...</i>

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:56.543
We can try the hallway
after it gets dark.

01:19:56.626 --> 01:20:00.126
If I can make my way up front, I could
break some windows, call for help.

01:20:02.376 --> 01:20:05.084
No one out there can help us.

01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:30.043
The other morning you said that
you had something to tell me.

01:20:33.543 --> 01:20:36.251
And you probably...

01:20:36.334 --> 01:20:38.959
think that none of that matters now.

01:20:40.959 --> 01:20:43.043
But you're wrong.

01:20:43.126 --> 01:20:45.209
It's the only thing that does.

01:21:48.084 --> 01:21:52.084
Worker ants,
driven to a higher purpose,

01:21:52.168 --> 01:21:54.501
unknown to the individual.

01:21:55.876 --> 01:21:58.001
Street people...

01:21:58.084 --> 01:22:00.459
our colleagues, all controlled.

01:22:03.334 --> 01:22:05.793
- Demonic possession?
- Of a kind.

01:22:07.626 --> 01:22:11.251
Not what we would expect, though.
Never that.

01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:14.459
Why would he need us?

01:22:14.543 --> 01:22:17.668
The book says his purpose
is to bring the Father

01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:21.751
back from the dark side,
wherever that is.

01:22:21.834 --> 01:22:24.459
There could be a limit as to
what he could do, you know,

01:22:24.543 --> 01:22:27.459
as a volume of liquid.

01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:31.043
He controls simple organisms easily.

01:22:32.459 --> 01:22:37.043
But maybe he needs something more
complex to complete a life cycle,

01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:39.001
a host in which to live.

01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:40.626
Hello?

01:22:42.126 --> 01:22:43.584
Hello?

01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:47.501
- Walter?
- It's Kelly. She's changing again.

01:22:47.584 --> 01:22:52.126
The swelling's gone down, as if the
liquid was absorbed into her system.

01:22:52.209 --> 01:22:54.668
I can see tissue changes on her face.

01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:57.126
Also, I think her bone structure
is changing.

01:22:57.209 --> 01:23:01.751
Maybe this is the only way
he could actualise his power.

01:23:02.751 --> 01:23:06.668
A parasite growing into its host.

01:23:06.751 --> 01:23:09.834
This could be
some kind of gestation period.

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:12.126
I knew I'd seen it before.

01:23:12.209 --> 01:23:15.584
Kelly had a mark. It was a
bruise, almost like a figure.

01:23:15.668 --> 01:23:18.459
I saw it in a history book...
the astrologer's staff,

01:23:18.543 --> 01:23:21.334
used in ritual magic in the Middle Ages.

01:23:21.418 --> 01:23:24.126
- The mark was on her?
- Yes.

01:23:24.209 --> 01:23:26.959
As if she were chosen.

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.626
- Walter!
- What?

01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:34.209
Keep watching her closely.
Anything that you see, tell us!

01:23:34.293 --> 01:23:36.584
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:23:36.668 --> 01:23:40.251
God... and Father...

01:23:41.418 --> 01:23:43.168
of our Lord...

01:23:44.834 --> 01:23:47.543
Jesus Christ.

01:23:47.626 --> 01:23:50.668
I appeal to your...

01:23:50.751 --> 01:23:52.668
holy name,

01:23:54.084 --> 01:23:56.834
humbly begging that you...

01:24:00.584 --> 01:24:03.334
will grant us help...

01:24:05.334 --> 01:24:07.543
against this...

01:24:10.876 --> 01:24:12.709
unclean...

01:24:14.793 --> 01:24:16.584
spirit.

01:24:25.959 --> 01:24:27.209
Thou...

01:24:29.793 --> 01:24:32.751
tormenteth these creatures...

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:34.709
of hell.

01:24:38.876 --> 01:24:41.084
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

01:25:13.876 --> 01:25:16.001
Look down...

01:25:16.084 --> 01:25:18.709
upon these, thy servants,

01:25:18.793 --> 01:25:21.751
caught in the coils of...

01:25:37.376 --> 01:25:39.584
Where are you?

01:25:43.959 --> 01:25:45.501
Christ,

01:25:50.501 --> 01:25:53.001
where are you?

01:26:04.168 --> 01:26:05.876
Holy shit!

01:26:07.168 --> 01:26:11.709
Get me the hell out of here!
Help me! Help me get out of here!

01:26:11.793 --> 01:26:14.168
They're gonna kill me!
I don't want to die!

01:26:14.251 --> 01:26:16.043
Help me! Help!

01:26:16.126 --> 01:26:17.751
Help me!

01:26:17.834 --> 01:26:21.668
- Behind the door. Behind the door!
- You can't, Brian!

01:26:23.626 --> 01:26:26.293
Oh, God! Help!

01:26:26.376 --> 01:26:29.293
Help me! Oh!

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.001
Hey!

01:27:32.001 --> 01:27:32.959
Aagh!

01:27:50.626 --> 01:27:53.084
Uhh! Aaagh!

01:27:59.376 --> 01:28:00.668
Aagh!

01:28:37.418 --> 01:28:38.918
Come on!

01:28:48.334 --> 01:28:49.376
Aagh!

01:28:50.584 --> 01:28:51.959
Come on!

01:29:07.584 --> 01:29:09.876
Aaaagh!

01:29:24.251 --> 01:29:26.751
It's not working!

01:29:34.543 --> 01:29:36.334
Aaaagh!

01:29:36.418 --> 01:29:40.376
Father!

01:31:13.209 --> 01:31:15.918
Father!

01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:17.168
Aagh!

01:31:34.793 --> 01:31:36.668
- Uhh!
- Aaaagh!

01:31:58.501 --> 01:32:00.709
I could.

01:32:00.793 --> 01:32:02.501
I could.

01:32:18.918 --> 01:32:20.959
Unclean spirit.

01:32:38.043 --> 01:32:40.168
Uhh!

01:32:40.251 --> 01:32:42.584
Aagh!

01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:45.709
Aagh!

01:33:07.293 --> 01:33:08.834
Abomination!

01:33:24.209 --> 01:33:25.709
Aagh!

01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:31.251
Father.

01:33:32.793 --> 01:33:37.584
Come to freedom!

01:34:24.043 --> 01:34:26.501
Christi Dominio!

01:34:26.584 --> 01:34:27.584
No!

01:36:00.376 --> 01:36:02.418
We stopped it.

01:36:04.001 --> 01:36:06.168
We stopped it here.

01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:10.376
Through the grace of God...

01:36:11.626 --> 01:36:13.918
I stopped it.

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:16.876
The future conjured up by the...

01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:20.751
that vile serpent...

01:36:22.668 --> 01:36:24.876
will not happen now.

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:41.834
The smaller parts could not live

01:36:41.918 --> 01:36:44.251
without the strength of the whole.

01:36:44.334 --> 01:36:47.459
They had to die, to fade away,

01:36:47.543 --> 01:36:50.501
as the whole was thrown
back and repelled.

01:36:53.334 --> 01:36:55.001
We're safe...

01:36:56.001 --> 01:36:58.459
but he's waiting on the other side.

01:37:02.168 --> 01:37:04.043
She died for us.

01:37:09.126 --> 01:37:11.584
<i>This is not a dream. Not a dream.</i>
