00:01.534 --> 00:03.869
Narrator:
Kids, in the spring of 2013,

00:03.871 --> 00:06.772
We were all tying up loose ends
before the big wedding.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.340
<i>I was right here</i>
<i>in this very room,</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:09.942
<i>Putting the finishing touches</i>
<i>on the house.</i>

00:14.147 --> 00:17.149
Oh, come on!

00:17.151 --> 00:19.318
Narrator: <i>Barney and robin</i>
<i>were wrapping up rehearsal</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:20.319
<i>For their first dance.</i>

00:20.321 --> 00:22.788
That was amazing.
We can do better.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.989
Back to one, everyone!

00:23.991 --> 00:27.159
Reload the cannons,
we'll go again right away.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.495
(sighs)

00:29.497 --> 00:30.896
Narrator: <i>And lily and marshall</i>
<i>were packing</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:32.898
<i>For their year in Italy.</i>

00:32.900 --> 00:34.166
(phone rings)

00:34.168 --> 00:36.168
Hello.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.037
How's my favorite
daughter-in-law?

00:38.039 --> 00:39.038
Oh, things are

00:39.040 --> 00:40.339
A bit crazy here.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.341
We've got this big move to rome
coming up,

00:42.343 --> 00:43.909
And I, I just can't shake
the feeling

00:43.911 --> 00:46.178
That I'm forgetting something,
you know.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.881
I know, I know,
I'm being crazy, right?

00:48.883 --> 00:50.582
Right, judy?

00:50.584 --> 00:51.583
Right,
judy?

00:51.585 --> 00:54.153
You're moving to rome?!

00:55.088 --> 00:56.188
(whispering):
Is that my mom?

00:56.190 --> 00:58.824
Don't mention rome.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.240
You didn't tell
your mom about rome?

01:15.242 --> 01:16.241
It didn't feel right.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.910
This isn't
over-the-phone news.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.178
This is face-to-face news.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.047
I was gonna tell her
when we see her at christmas.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.348
You were gonna wait and tell her

01:23.350 --> 01:25.951
After we had already been living
there for six months?

01:25.953 --> 01:28.587
That... Was a great plan.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.655
Damn it.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.425
Hey, mom, it's marshall.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.127
If you're moving to rome,

01:35.129 --> 01:39.131
I at least need to see
my grandson before you go!

01:39.133 --> 01:41.600
Of course, and that is why
we would love

01:41.602 --> 01:43.869
For you to come visit us
for a week.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.904
No.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.639
The place will be all packed up.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.309
Oh, oh, uh, okay, hey, mom,
better idea:

01:50.311 --> 01:52.778
How about we all come visit you
for a week?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.413
I can't go to minnesota
for a week.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.615
I have a job.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.118
Okay, mom, here's the plan:
Um, lily has to work,

01:59.120 --> 02:02.888
So marvin and I will come visit
you for a whole week,

02:02.890 --> 02:04.490
And I-I'll see if I can
get a last-minute flight.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.994
You are going to take
my infant son

02:08.996 --> 02:11.296
Away from me for a whole week?

02:11.298 --> 02:14.333
Whoo!

02:14.335 --> 02:16.668
So, what do you want
to do tonight--

02:16.670 --> 02:18.937
Drink ourselves blind,
set a car on fire?

02:18.939 --> 02:21.573
(gasps) ooh, watch a movie
that doesn't start

02:21.575 --> 02:24.176
With a desk lamp jumping
on top of a capital "I"?

02:24.911 --> 02:26.745
I'm all yours, teddy westside.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.181
Actually, tonight
it's teddy westchester.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.450
Got to head up to the house,
take care of some stuff.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.819
Oh, yeah,
how's the restoration going?

02:33.821 --> 02:36.421
Actually, done.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.422
You finished the house?

02:37.424 --> 02:39.258
Well, I want to see it.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.026
Marshall already canceled
the cable, huh?

02:41.028 --> 02:42.327
And the wi-fi.
It's like <i>little house</i>

02:42.329 --> 02:43.595
<i>On the freaking prairie</i>
<i>up there.</i>

02:43.597 --> 02:44.696
Mm-hmm.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.934
Well, the wedding
planning is done,

02:48.936 --> 02:52.504
So tonight is all about relaxing
and celebrating

02:52.506 --> 02:54.473
Everything that makes us
awesome,

02:54.475 --> 02:55.307
Which is why

02:55.309 --> 02:57.643
I requested our favorite table.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.678
The one by the window.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.148
Where we were sitting the night
we saw those two bums fighting.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.983
Both:
Over a sandwich.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.519
(both laughing)

03:07.521 --> 03:09.154
We almost called the cops.
(sighs)

03:09.156 --> 03:11.323
And then we realized
they weren't fighting at all.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.724
They were making love.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.492
(sighs)

03:13.494 --> 03:15.127
Over a sandwich.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.496
Oh, I almost forgot.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.997
(gasps)

03:18.999 --> 03:20.065
Ha-ha, yeah.
No way,
is that...?

03:20.067 --> 03:22.334
El piramide.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.037
The first cigar
we ever smoked together.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.638
Aw, barney.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.339
(chuckles)

03:27.341 --> 03:28.907
Woman:
Excuse me.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.075
Hi.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.743
Could you not?
Thanks.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.978
Uh...

03:32.980 --> 03:34.179
Dude, I'm not gonna
light 'em up in here.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.148
I'm just looking
at 'em.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.016
Right, but even
when they're unlit,

03:38.018 --> 03:40.219
The smell-- it's very...

03:40.221 --> 03:41.220
Pungent.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.188
Exactly--
thank you.

03:43.190 --> 03:46.725
It's a very pungent smell.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.994
So, could you not?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.062
Thanks.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.066
Okay.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.501
(sighs)

03:56.503 --> 04:00.739
I'm sorry, can you also
put the bag away?

04:00.741 --> 04:05.844
It-it's just really
unappetizing to look at.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.379
You're unappetizing to look at.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.915
You know what?
Um, I'll put them away, okay?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.083
Enjoy your night.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.185
We'll try.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.855
Did those two just become
our archenemies?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.090
No, robin, they've
always been

04:18.092 --> 04:19.057
Our archenemies.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.461
They've only just
revealed themselves.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.695
Hi, kristen?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.864
Everyone pronounces it wrong.
(groans)

04:25.866 --> 04:27.899
The "r" is
after the "I."

04:27.901 --> 04:28.934
Kirsten.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.369
And before the "I."

04:30.371 --> 04:33.238
(sighs)
it's krirsten.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.706
Your table's ready.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.211
Wow, they're "trerrible."

04:39.213 --> 04:40.212
You know what?

04:40.214 --> 04:42.114
Don't even think
about them, okay?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.283
Tonight is about
celebrating us.
You're right,
you're right.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.052
We shouldn't let
a couple...
Man:
Nope, nope.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.487
I'm a self-diagnosed
claustrophobic.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.889
I have to sit
next to the window.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.591
No, that's our table,
that's our table,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.293
That's our table,
that's our table,
that's our table,

04:54.295 --> 04:55.894
That's our table.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.796
(groans)

04:57.798 --> 04:59.064
You know what?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.166
Screw celebrating us.
You know what we're gonna do?

05:01.168 --> 05:04.169
Both:
Make those smug,
obnoxious sons of bitches pay.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.604
Aw...

05:05.606 --> 05:07.739
(both giggle)

05:07.741 --> 05:09.941
Narrator:
<i>So aunt lily and I drove up</i>
<i>to westchester.</i>

05:09.943 --> 05:10.942
(phone rings)

05:10.944 --> 05:13.178
Hey, baby,

05:13.180 --> 05:14.179
How's minnesota?

05:14.181 --> 05:15.947
Marshall:
It is so much fun.

05:15.949 --> 05:20.285
Marshall, I made you this
welcome-home ice cream sundae.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.988
But I can't remember,
do you like crushed nuts?

05:22.990 --> 05:23.989
Marshall:
I love

05:23.991 --> 05:25.090
Crushed nuts.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.558
Oh!

05:28.094 --> 05:31.029
Anyway, it's,
it's great to be home.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.464
How's judy doing?

05:32.466 --> 05:33.598
Oh, she's great.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.866
It's cute, you know,
she keeps joking

05:34.868 --> 05:36.601
About how she's not
gonna let us leave.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.969
I'm really not.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.604
It's not a joke.

05:39.606 --> 05:40.605
(laughing)

05:40.607 --> 05:44.976
(all laughing)

05:44.978 --> 05:46.812
Judy's going to talk him
out of going to rome.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.947
I knew something was going
to screw up our plans,

05:48.949 --> 05:50.349
And this is it.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.818
She is going to convince him
never to leave the country.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.786
I think
you're imagining things.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.989
Oh, yeah? Well, check out
what's already on facebook.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.624
Inconclusive.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.460
Oh, really?

06:03.463 --> 06:04.730
It's getting
conclusiver.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.731
Hey, lily.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.033
What?
Come on.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.969
Okay, open 'em.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.405
Your eyes-- sorry,
they should have been closed.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.406
That one's on me.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.407
Let's try again.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.575
Wow.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.978
Ted, you did this
all yourself?

06:19.980 --> 06:22.981
Just like ryan gosling
in   <i>the notebook.</i>

06:22.983 --> 06:25.016
I was pretty manly
till I mentioned

06:25.018 --> 06:27.018
Ryan gosling
in <i>the notebook,</i> huh?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.587
Even I haven't seen it, ted.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.323
Just think, this is the house

06:31.325 --> 06:33.091
Your kids are going
to grow up in.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.927
They are going to
roast marshmallows

06:35.929 --> 06:37.763
In this fireplace.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.764
They're gonna
experiment

06:38.766 --> 06:40.999
With recreational drugs

06:41.001 --> 06:42.167
On that porch.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.435
They're gonna sit
on a couch right here

06:43.437 --> 06:45.170
And listen to your
boring stories about...

06:45.172 --> 06:48.173
"for sale" sign?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.076
Are you selling this place?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.044
Yeah.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.479
Why?

06:55.448 --> 06:59.451
Because I'm moving to chicago.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.026
Ow.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.060
So, what are
we gonna do--

07:09.062 --> 07:10.295
Put something in their food,

07:10.297 --> 07:12.431
Key their car?
Ooh,

07:12.433 --> 07:14.032
Do either
of those cigars explode?

07:14.034 --> 07:17.202
Hold on, wile e. Coyote,
I think I got something.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.539
He's checking
out the hostess.

07:20.541 --> 07:24.075
Now, a guy who's happily in
a relationship sees a girl

07:24.077 --> 07:28.513
Like that, he'll check her out
maybe 14, 15 times, tops.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.116
16 times, tops.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.920
So krirsten's more invested
in the relationship

07:34.922 --> 07:37.055
Than her fella is.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.090
That could spell trouble.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.859
Challenge accepted.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.995
Hey, do you think it's bad luck
for a bride

07:43.997 --> 07:46.998
To break up two strangers
a week before her wedding?

07:47.000 --> 07:51.336
I'd say it's very bad luck...
For krirsten.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.371
(both laughing)

07:56.576 --> 07:59.311
Ow, I hate this table so much!

07:59.313 --> 08:00.512
Why would you move

08:00.514 --> 08:02.147
To chicago?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.949
Because it's the perfect town
for me.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.017
I-it's like a clevelandy
new york,

08:06.019 --> 08:07.619
And-- don't act like
you haven't noticed--

08:07.621 --> 08:09.988
My hair excels in the wind.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.122
Besides,

08:11.124 --> 08:12.190
You're moving to rome.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.960
Yeah, for a year,
a-and when we get back,

08:14.962 --> 08:16.928
We need you to be here waiting
for us,

08:16.930 --> 08:20.699
Hopefully living in this house
with your future bride.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.968
Wha... What future bride?

08:22.970 --> 08:23.969
The girl.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.136
She's out there

08:25.138 --> 08:27.138
Walking around new york city
right now,

08:27.140 --> 08:29.608
Probably in a pair
of really cute boots

08:29.610 --> 08:31.443
That she's gonna let me borrow
whenever I want

08:31.445 --> 08:32.777
Because we're the same size.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.379
She is out there, ted.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.982
Is she, really?
Because I've looked.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.016
I have looked high

08:38.018 --> 08:40.318
And low for someone I can love

08:40.320 --> 08:42.888
And adore and cook waffles for.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.322
The closest I've come is
marshall.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.490
He does love your waffles.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.625
It's the
cinnamon.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.193
I add cinnamon.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.029
She's not in new york.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.631
Maybe she's in chicago.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.400
Okay, you are being ridiculous.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.036
You are going to find someone
here in new york

08:58.038 --> 09:00.138
That you love
just as much as I love marshall.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.506
And you,

09:01.508 --> 09:05.577
If you let judy talk you out
of going to Italy, so help me,

09:05.579 --> 09:09.247
I will never let you stuff
my ravioli again.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.982
I'm gonna take you
off speaker.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.384
Lily, you got to relax.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.487
Okay, my mom is psyched
about Italy.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.088
She keeps making jokes
about how she's gonna

09:17.090 --> 09:20.659
Come live with us in rome
and sleep on the couch

09:20.661 --> 09:22.027
And cook every meal for us

09:22.029 --> 09:23.995
So we never have to go
to a restaurant

09:23.997 --> 09:25.163
The whole year we're there.

09:25.165 --> 09:25.997
It's not a joke.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.032
By not saying no

09:27.034 --> 09:29.100
To me right now,
you are giving me

09:29.102 --> 09:31.202
Your full consent
for that to happen.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.571
(laughs)

09:32.573 --> 09:35.073
(laughing and mumbling)

09:35.075 --> 09:36.107
(forced laugh)

09:36.109 --> 09:37.676
I got to go.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.744
Barney:
"I'm probably saying
some political stuff

09:39.746 --> 09:40.912
Right now to sound smart."

09:40.914 --> 09:43.448
"I'm probably referring
to some snooty podcast

09:43.450 --> 09:45.517
To sound even smarter."

09:45.519 --> 09:47.052
"I'm probably saying
something in french."

09:47.054 --> 09:48.053
Aah!

09:48.055 --> 09:49.054
My god...

09:49.056 --> 09:50.956
Ow.

09:50.958 --> 09:51.957
Okay,

09:51.959 --> 09:52.958
You want to break them up?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.259
I got a plan.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.394
It's something I know has worked
in the past,

09:56.396 --> 09:57.929
But it-it's, it's risky,

09:57.931 --> 10:00.398
So it's, it's not too late
to call it off.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.034
No way, I'm in.
Good, 'cause it's too late
to call it off.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.936
Observe.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.104
And that is
why the senate

10:06.106 --> 10:07.606
Can't push anything through.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.474
And doug mand said
the same thing in his podcast.
It's like,

10:09.476 --> 10:11.810
"après moi le déluge!"

10:11.812 --> 10:13.044
(laughing)

10:15.414 --> 10:17.482
Ooh.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.583
Oh, my gosh.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.985
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.253
Yes, yes, yes.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.421
Yes!

10:23.423 --> 10:24.222
Man:
What?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.457
Krirsten:
Yes!

10:25.459 --> 10:28.293
(chuckles) even though
a ring in a champagne glass

10:28.295 --> 10:30.128
Is a total cliché
and this is a cushion cut.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.130
And how long have I been hinting
that I want a princess cut?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.164
But yes!

10:33.166 --> 10:34.799
That's a mistake.
That's not from me.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.801
It's not?

10:36.803 --> 10:40.138
We've only been together
seven years.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.008
Now it becomes clear.
Here we go.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.410
You want commitment the same way
you want my brother

10:45.412 --> 10:47.979
To work for you.
I'm sorry I didn't put an
engagement ring in your drink.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.316
The way you chug booze,
I'm surprised you even noticed.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.518
So, when are you leaving?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.153
Day after the wedding.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.154
What?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.323
You can't miss the day
after the wedding.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.693
That's when we sit around
all hungover, drinking mimosas

11:01.695 --> 11:03.862
And talking smack
about who looked fat.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.930
That's my christmas.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.900
Why are you in such a rush
to get out of there?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.871
Oh.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.306
Of course.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.375
You're not leaving
because you think

11:17.377 --> 11:19.611
The love of your life
isn't in new york.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.680
You're leaving because
you think she is.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.114
And this time next week,

11:23.116 --> 11:26.051
She'll be married
to your best friend.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.019
(phone rings)

11:28.021 --> 11:29.554
(sighs) baby!

11:29.556 --> 11:30.955
I am in the middle

11:30.957 --> 11:34.959
But real quick: If you let judy
come to rome with us,

11:34.961 --> 11:37.028
You are going to have
to find someone else

11:37.030 --> 11:39.064
To do your laundry
and massage your feet.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.966
Oh, my gosh, she's going to do
all that, won't she?

11:41.968 --> 11:44.135
Lily, you have to stop
freaking out.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.337
Nothing is going to screw up
the plan.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.972
We're doing this.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.240
I love you.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.975
I love you, baby. Bye.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.512
(phone rings)

11:54.514 --> 11:55.914
Hello?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.248
Hi. Marshall eriksen?

11:57.250 --> 12:00.318
I'm calling from the new york
state judiciary committee.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.887
Uh, you applied for a judgeship
a few months ago, remember?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.422
Uh, of... Of course.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.857
Well, I have good news.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.059
We have a last-minute opening
on the bench.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.028
What are you saying to me
right now?

12:10.030 --> 12:11.529
I'm saying congratulations.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.598
We want you to be a judge.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.073
So, you want me to be a judge?
Yes.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.942
And I would start a week
from Tuesday?
Yes.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.111
Could I maybe start
a year from Tuesday?
No.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.946
Got to be a week from Tuesday?
Yes.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.414
And I'd be a real judge?
Yes.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.381
With a robe?
Yes.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.416
Gavel?
Yes.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.118
Wacky southern accent?
No.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.352
(bad southern accent):
Now, counselor,

12:34.354 --> 12:35.754
Are you absolutely sure?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.455
Yes.
And I have to be
in new york for this?

12:37.457 --> 12:39.090
Yes.
I can't telecommute?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.192
No.
I couldn't be the crazy
speakerphone judge?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.927
No.
Could I be a hologram?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.629
No.
Animatronic robot

12:44.631 --> 12:46.765
Like abe lincoln
from the hall of presidents

12:46.767 --> 12:49.601
That I control from afar
with a joystick?
No.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.970
Do you remember the giant
jor-el head from <i>superman?</i>

12:51.972 --> 12:53.071
Yes.
Well, what if I...?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.773
No.
Is there any way

12:54.775 --> 12:56.374
That I could do this

12:56.376 --> 12:59.444
And also spend
the next year of my life

12:59.446 --> 13:01.279
In Italy with my wife?
No.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.281
This is such a big decision.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.717
I-I'm not good at big decisions.

13:05.719 --> 13:08.153
Are you sure you want
to be a judge?

13:09.889 --> 13:13.057
Wow. Now that we've broken up
a seven-year relationship

13:13.059 --> 13:14.926
Just 'cause they
stole our table,

13:14.928 --> 13:16.761
I feel kind of...
Awesome?

13:16.763 --> 13:19.164
I was going to say horny,
but yeah, awesome, too.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.266
(both laughing)

13:21.268 --> 13:22.467
No way.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.102
Are you kidding me?
What?

13:24.104 --> 13:25.069
Barney:
Whoa. Is there
going to be a fight?

13:25.071 --> 13:26.404
Okay, here's the play.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.339
You take the girl, and
the guy and I will watch.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.975
Hello. Just the people
we want to see.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.646
We got in a pretty big fight
because of you guys.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.281
We had to call our
therapists after hours.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.283
Not cool.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.118
Anyway, it got us
to where we are now.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.519
We're getting married!

13:42.488 --> 13:43.788
And I'm taking
her last name.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.290
You should think
about doing the same thing.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.925
Well, good night.
Good night.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.693
Good night.
Congratulations.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.129
Yes, definitely.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.164
That was us.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.000
We made that happen.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.002
We're pretty cool.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.371
And, you know,
a week from today,

14:00.373 --> 14:03.842
We are going to be legend...
Wait for it...

14:03.844 --> 14:04.943
Married.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.811
Legend-married.
Legend-married.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.047
(both laughing)

14:09.049 --> 14:12.150
Robin scherbatsky,
I love you so damn much.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.786
I love you, too,
barney scherbatsky.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.454
That sounds good.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.989
Shh.
Think about it.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.524
Ted:
<i>They're happy.</i>

14:19.526 --> 14:21.359
<i>And I'm happy for them.</i>

14:21.361 --> 14:24.062
I want them to have an amazing
life together. I just...

14:24.064 --> 14:26.030
I just think it would
be best for everyone

14:26.032 --> 14:31.002
Did something happen recently
between you and robin?

14:31.004 --> 14:32.704
No.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.205
Where's the poop, ted?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.576
She called me up the other day.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.411
<i>She was trying</i>
<i>to dig up this locket</i>

14:40.413 --> 14:42.347
<i>She had buried behind</i>
<i>the central park carousel,</i>

14:42.349 --> 14:45.216
<i>And I blew off that</i>
<i>big interview to go help her.</i>

14:45.218 --> 14:49.120
And then... It started raining.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.392
I'll, uh...

14:54.394 --> 14:55.727
I'll see you
at the wedding.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.395
Yeah.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.397
Ted: <i>Even now,</i>
<i>after all these years,</i>

14:59.399 --> 15:01.866
There's still just
this part of me where,

15:01.868 --> 15:03.368
If there's even
the slightest chance

15:03.370 --> 15:05.203
Something I do
could make robin smile,

15:05.205 --> 15:08.239
I don't even think about it--
I just do it.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.607
I mean, if I could make

15:09.609 --> 15:11.442
That locket magically appear,
I would.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.544
I would open a vein in my arm

15:13.546 --> 15:15.747
If I could bleed
that locket out,

15:15.749 --> 15:17.815
Just to make her happy.

15:19.118 --> 15:22.086
That's just
a really sucky way to feel

15:22.088 --> 15:24.355
About your best friend's
fiancée.

15:26.191 --> 15:29.460
So I'm going to come
to the wedding, and, uh,

15:29.462 --> 15:32.196
You know, I'll have a good time,
but after that, I...

15:33.299 --> 15:34.499
What?

15:35.768 --> 15:39.037
(sighs)
I know where the locket is.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.438
What?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.607
I know where the locket is.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.642
It-it was a few years ago,

15:44.644 --> 15:46.244
<i>Right before you were</i>
<i>supposed to marry stella.</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:48.046
<i>I went down to the bar</i>
<i>one night</i>

15:48.048 --> 15:49.881
<i>To get a drink,</i>
<i>and what should I see?</i>

15:49.883 --> 15:50.982
Lily!

15:50.984 --> 15:52.750
Hey, girl.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.452
I got a question for you.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.089
Why isn't ted marrying me?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.457
Whoa...

15:59.459 --> 16:01.559
I'm sorry. Oh, god.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.927
I'm sorry.

16:02.929 --> 16:06.397
I just... I-I should
be happy for him,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.466
And yet here I am,

16:08.468 --> 16:12.170
Moving off to japan just
to get away from him.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.272
And-and I guess
to see those...

16:14.274 --> 16:17.008
Those terra-cotta warriors
and the great wall.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.743
Well, that's china.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.011
What? This?

16:20.013 --> 16:21.312
No, it's just a paper plate.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.314
(plate shatters)

16:23.316 --> 16:24.849
Uh, we should
get out of here.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.150
Come on. Come on.
Oh, totally.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.586
I know just where we should go.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.024
Man, you're fast
when you're drunk.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.094
But at least you're still
making good decisions.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.962
Central park,
around midnight,

16:37.964 --> 16:39.931
Digging a hole
with a spoon.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.099
Solid.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.134
Jackpot. (sighs)

16:43.136 --> 16:44.168
What is that?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.371
My something old.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.977
This locket was my grandma's.

16:52.979 --> 16:56.814
She kept it hidden in her butt
all through world war ii.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.116
What? Where was she?

16:58.118 --> 17:00.618
Winnipeg.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.986
(laughing)

17:01.988 --> 17:02.954
Oh, come on.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.289
Lily, it's a joke.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.291
Yeah, I was
going to wear this

17:07.293 --> 17:08.493
When I married ted.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.961
I guess that's not
going to happen.

17:09.963 --> 17:13.398
So I am taking it
with me to japan.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.968
Okay, lily, help me put
this locket in my butt.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.736
Okay. Uh, you know what?

17:18.738 --> 17:23.074
Why don't we put it
in this pencil box instead?

17:23.076 --> 17:27.011
