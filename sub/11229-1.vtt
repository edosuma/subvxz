00:19.960 --> 00:21.580
Pocket Monsters.

00:21.580 --> 00:24.220
Pokemon for short.

00:24.220 --> 00:27.890
They are this world's strange,
mysterious creatures.

00:27.890 --> 00:30.340
The number of species are 100,

00:30.340 --> 00:31.570
200,

00:31.570 --> 00:33.050
300...

00:33.050 --> 00:35.720
No, possibly even more than that.

00:38.420 --> 00:43.240
Pokemon and humans put their powers
together as friends and partners.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.240
In other times, they face off
against opponents.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.390
They exist all over the world.

00:53.030 --> 00:56.290
This boy is Satoshi of Masara Town.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.310
Aiming to become a Pokemon Master,
he battles and catches them.

01:02.310 --> 01:04.720
His journey of training continues.

01:07.340 --> 01:09.800
With as many meetings as there are Pokemon,

01:09.800 --> 01:12.780
and with just as many partings,

01:12.780 --> 01:17.570
many stories have been woven in this way.

01:18.840 --> 01:19.930
Yes.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.730
It has been this way since a long,

01:22.730 --> 01:24.480
long time ago.

01:32.820 --> 01:39.950
A long time ago...
In an era before monster balls had
come into existence...

03:41.970 --> 03:43.150
Aaron-sama.

03:43.450 --> 03:44.410
Aaron-sama!

04:00.060 --> 04:01.390
Aaron-sama!

04:01.850 --> 04:03.050
I can hear you, Lucario.

04:03.930 --> 04:05.470
An incredible number of troops are coming!

04:06.610 --> 04:10.340
If we get caught up in them, our castle won't stand a chance!

04:10.340 --> 04:11.990
At this rate...

04:15.860 --> 04:18.980
The fight can't be stopped anymore.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.680
I cannot leave this place.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.150
As Queen, I will share the same fate as the castle.

05:05.210 --> 05:06.070
Leen-sama.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.290
Aaron-sama!

06:09.700 --> 06:10.860
Aaron-sama.

06:10.860 --> 06:11.900
Lucario.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.080
Your eyes...

06:13.080 --> 06:14.690
I am fine.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.530
Leave this place.

06:18.410 --> 06:21.400
I've abandoned the castle.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.730
I can't return ever again.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.030
What are you saying?

06:28.660 --> 06:30.090
Please wait!

06:36.860 --> 06:37.990
Aaron-sama!

06:48.100 --> 06:50.350
Why?

07:11.030 --> 07:12.170
The tree...

07:12.170 --> 07:15.700
The Tree of World's Origin is weeping.

08:26.130 --> 08:26.920
Aaron!

09:27.090 --> 09:30.180
Queen Leen believed

09:30.180 --> 09:32.350
that the Wave-user Aaron had used the power

09:32.350 --> 09:37.200
of the Tree of World's Origin where Mew is said to live.

09:37.990 --> 09:39.770
And then what?

09:39.770 --> 09:44.750
The hatred and anger that shrouded the land subsided.

09:44.750 --> 09:49.560
The Pokemon returned to their respective homes.

09:50.290 --> 09:54.470
And so peace again returned to this land.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.280
That's good!

09:59.420 --> 10:05.360
And so, Aaron became known as the "Hero of the Wave."

10:06.180 --> 10:08.990
Tell me the Hero of the Wave story again sometime!

10:08.990 --> 10:10.470
Sure.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.460
And now...

10:29.770 --> 10:37.480
Pocket Monsters

10:31.440 --> 10:37.480
Theatrical                          Edition

11:22.070 --> 11:39.210
Mew and the Hero of the Wave

11:24.990 --> 11:39.210
Lucario

11:45.130 --> 11:48.870
Aiming to become a Pokemon Master, Satoshi and the others continues their journey,

11:48.870 --> 11:51.890
and they have arrived here, at Aldoran Castle.

11:51.890 --> 11:58.220
They are here to participate in a festival commemorating the Hero of the Wave, Aaron.

11:58.220 --> 12:00.810
Whoever wins the Pokemon battle in the castle...

12:00.810 --> 12:04.930
will be named the Hero of the Wave for that year.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.400
When you go to an event in a castle, you have to wear old-fashioned garments!

12:12.150 --> 12:14.130
I don't have any!

12:15.020 --> 12:17.170
It says that they have some prepared in the castle.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.010
Really?

12:18.010 --> 12:19.720
I wonder if they have the hero's outfit too!

12:21.050 --> 12:23.440
We should dress Pikachu up too!

12:23.740 --> 12:25.070
That might be good!

12:56.890 --> 12:58.950
We can pick from any of these?

12:58.950 --> 13:00.360
Which one should I wear?

13:00.360 --> 13:01.580
I can't decide!

13:01.580 --> 13:02.930
Where's the hero's outfit?

13:04.340 --> 13:06.090
I'll take... uh...

13:25.900 --> 13:26.870
Ta-da!

13:28.650 --> 13:30.400
How's this, Pikachu?

13:34.460 --> 13:36.210
Onee-chan?

13:36.210 --> 13:37.590
That is correct.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.630
It suits you.

13:39.630 --> 13:40.660
Doesn't it?

13:41.380 --> 13:42.800
I'm a hero!

13:42.800 --> 13:44.100
How's this, Pikachu?

13:55.730 --> 13:57.280
This might be cute!

13:57.280 --> 13:58.360
It looks good on you!

13:59.440 --> 14:02.070
The Pokemon Battle is starting soon.

14:02.070 --> 14:02.730
All right.

14:02.730 --> 14:04.060
Pikachu, let's go!

14:12.760 --> 14:14.760
While everyone is preoccupied with that,

14:14.760 --> 14:17.810
we'll take all the Pokemon in the castle!

14:19.080 --> 14:21.030
We need to change clothes first.

14:21.030 --> 14:22.740
What should I pick?

14:22.740 --> 14:23.800
Hurry up!

14:24.990 --> 14:27.030
This is so wonderful!

14:28.610 --> 14:29.580
So fast!

14:40.660 --> 14:43.300
The Queen of this country

14:43.300 --> 14:45.620
and Lady of Aldoran Castle...

14:45.620 --> 14:48.110
Eileen-sama!

14:57.140 --> 14:58.620
The Queen...

14:58.620 --> 14:59.500
This might be wonderful!

15:00.350 --> 15:04.180
In tribute to the Hero of the Wave, Aaron, who saved the world,

15:04.180 --> 15:05.830
we will now begin the Pokemon Battle!

I vow to battle eternally

15:31.040 --> 15:36.390
A smile with a bit of tears

15:36.890 --> 15:42.500
I won't forget any of you

15:43.080 --> 15:48.310
My feelings leap over the distance

15:49.010 --> 15:56.660
They'll reach you now, surely

15:58.280 --> 16:01.070
Intensely move ahead and cut through the wind

16:01.260 --> 16:03.850
Intensely I'll go all the way to the end

16:04.180 --> 16:06.290

16:10.170 --> 16:12.760
Steadily my power rises

16:13.150 --> 16:15.740
Steadily courages bursts forth

16:16.070 --> 16:20.780
Let's believe in limitless strength

16:35.320 --> 16:37.950
Intensely move ahead and cut through the wind

16:38.290 --> 16:40.890
Intensely I'll go all the way to the end

16:41.240 --> 16:43.400
Completely ablaze

16:47.220 --> 16:49.830
Steadily a plan comes to mind

16:50.180 --> 16:52.800
Steadily my attacks become unstoppable

16:53.160 --> 16:55.250
Absolute perfection

16:59.030 --> 17:01.660
Steadily my power continues to rise

17:02.050 --> 17:04.650
Steadily my courages bursts forth

17:04.980 --> 17:10.089
Run through the shining goal

17:21.430 --> 17:23.040
Manyula is unable to battle!

17:23.040 --> 17:24.730
Pikachu wins!

17:24.730 --> 17:28.660
Therefore, this year's Hero of the Wave is Satoshi of Masara Town!

17:29.900 --> 17:31.880
All right! We did it!

17:34.600 --> 17:35.600
Pikachu!

17:46.270 --> 17:48.620
You are Pikachu are the best partners, aren't you?

17:49.090 --> 17:50.460
A woman?!

17:54.230 --> 17:55.480
I'm Kid.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.270
Nice to meet you.

17:56.270 --> 17:56.970
I'm Satoshi.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.380
I am called Takeshi.

18:00.140 --> 18:03.510
I would like to become the best partner with a beautiful lady like...

18:03.510 --> 18:04.680
Ow, ow, ow!

18:03.120 --> 18:04.300
Right, right.

18:04.670 --> 18:07.220
Let's look over there.

18:30.130 --> 18:34.800
This is the Hero's Staff, which belonged to Hero of the Wave, Aaron.

18:36.370 --> 18:38.940
Only the one who wins the battle at the festival

18:38.940 --> 18:43.010
and is chosen as the hero is allowed to hold this.

18:43.170 --> 18:44.140
Awesome.

18:44.710 --> 18:47.340
Now, please accept this, Satoshi.

18:47.340 --> 18:47.960
Okay.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.670
So this is the Hero of the Wave's staff...

18:58.560 --> 18:59.730
Why?

19:02.810 --> 19:04.250
Did you say something?

19:04.510 --> 19:05.410
No.

19:08.780 --> 19:12.910
In commemoration of the Hero who protected this country, Aaron,

19:12.910 --> 19:14.250
let the festivities begin!

19:37.030 --> 19:38.360
K... Kid-san!

19:38.360 --> 19:40.410
M-M-May I have a dance with you?

19:40.410 --> 19:41.410
Of course.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.780
I'm honored!

19:47.240 --> 19:49.080
You don't have to be so nervous.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.320
I'll lead you.

19:50.470 --> 19:51.250
I'm so moved!

20:06.740 --> 20:07.770
Oh yeah!

20:08.630 --> 20:09.570
All right.

20:09.570 --> 20:11.470
Everyone, join the party!

20:21.130 --> 20:22.920
Excuse me for a moment.

20:25.590 --> 20:26.480
There!

20:33.370 --> 20:36.000
All right! I'm going to have a feast!

20:36.650 --> 20:37.470
Wait there.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.060
You can't do that.

20:39.060 --> 20:41.090
The Hero must not leave his seat.

20:41.350 --> 20:42.570
No way...

21:04.030 --> 21:06.540
Isn't this our chance to steal the Pokemon?

21:06.540 --> 21:08.560
I want to dance more!

21:08.560 --> 21:10.870
I've finally got a chance to wear such a nice dress!

21:09.750 --> 21:10.870
Excuse me.

21:12.990 --> 21:14.960
Your dancing is quite skillful.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.540
N-No...

21:16.910 --> 21:19.580
What a man! I could be in love!

21:20.940 --> 21:22.210
Feels good!

21:25.110 --> 21:26.570
Have we met somewhere before?

21:26.570 --> 21:29.510
N-No, we couldn't have...

21:32.350 --> 21:36.270
What a feast! This is the best!

21:50.730 --> 21:53.590
Takeshi-kun, could you get me a drink?

21:53.590 --> 21:54.880
Of course!

21:54.880 --> 21:56.290
Just wait a moment!

22:15.230 --> 22:16.630
It's morning there already, isn't it?

22:17.610 --> 22:19.950
Have you finished breakfast, Banks?

22:19.950 --> 22:22.190
I had a croissant and coffee.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.500
You should have a salad too.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.960
I think I'll have a vegetable juice.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.110
Make sure you put celery in it.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.500
That's a little...

22:31.500 --> 22:33.030
You can't just eat things you like.

22:33.030 --> 22:34.420
Sorry to trouble you.

22:35.390 --> 22:38.690
Have you finished dinner, my lady?

22:38.690 --> 22:42.640
It's a castle party, so I'm sure they have quite a selection.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.240
I'll save it for later.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.090
It can wait until I'm done with work.

22:46.090 --> 22:47.230
What a pity.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.840
I'm used to it.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.940
Besides that, transfer a map of the castle to me.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.300
Would you mind if I send it after I shower?

22:54.300 --> 22:55.340
No way.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.660
I'm holding off dinner for this.

22:57.660 --> 23:00.260
Then please wait 30 seconds.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.330
20 seconds.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.520
As you wish.

23:06.170 --> 23:07.770
Sorry I kept you waiting.

23:07.770 --> 23:09.590
I shall transfer it now.

23:09.590 --> 23:10.660
Thanks.

23:10.660 --> 23:13.260
Don't push yourself.

23:13.260 --> 23:14.660
Right, right. I know.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.650
Chief butler, Banks-sama.

23:22.170 --> 23:25.170
Those could be our rivals.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.920
Where did Pikachu and the others go?

23:47.670 --> 23:48.670
Gonbe?

25:10.880 --> 25:11.670
Um...

25:12.930 --> 25:13.840
Err...

25:14.890 --> 25:15.950
Could you be...

25:15.950 --> 25:18.780
Grand swing!

25:47.600 --> 25:49.140
Amazing.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.550
I found you.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.590
Put this locator beacon on Mew, got it?

26:46.020 --> 26:47.540
It's you guys!

26:48.620 --> 26:49.900
It's Mew!

27:29.780 --> 27:31.640
They're overdoing it.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.710
They only need to put on the beacon...

27:39.680 --> 27:40.380
What?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.310
You sure have a lot of free time.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.330
You guys have a lot of free time too.

28:24.290 --> 28:25.040
Pikachu!

28:25.040 --> 28:26.770
And Nyasu too!

28:29.100 --> 28:30.150
Mew?

28:36.010 --> 28:37.390
Instant teleportation?

28:48.850 --> 28:52.020
Pikachu, you're heavier than you look...

29:05.680 --> 29:08.460
You guys always get caught in the moment.

29:20.670 --> 29:21.720
This is trouble.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.330
So someone had this hundreds of years ago.

29:37.330 --> 29:38.720
It feels so strange.

29:43.410 --> 29:44.300
Why?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.150
I heard it again.

29:50.300 --> 29:53.840
We will now begin the evening party.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.870
The Hero of the Wave will see it off.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.870
Now, the Hero's pose!

29:59.870 --> 30:01.310
The Hero's pose?

30:19.960 --> 30:21.190
Why?

30:24.910 --> 30:26.010
What's wrong?

30:26.010 --> 30:28.210
There's something in this!

30:55.060 --> 30:56.020
Aaron-sama!

30:59.900 --> 31:02.190
Why did you abandon the castle?

31:02.600 --> 31:03.450
Telepathy?

31:04.070 --> 31:05.040
Why?!

31:05.040 --> 31:06.260
What are you saying?

31:20.770 --> 31:22.000
That's...

31:22.000 --> 31:23.340
Lucario.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.720
Lucario?

31:24.720 --> 31:28.320
He was the Hero, Aaron's, Pokemon.

31:28.320 --> 31:28.710
Yes.

31:28.710 --> 31:29.930
He was in here?

31:42.770 --> 31:44.290
Is this Aldoran Castle?

32:00.330 --> 32:01.500
Lucario.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.920
This is the castle where we'll both live starting from today.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.490
The training will be tough.

32:06.490 --> 32:07.020
Yes, sir.

32:07.590 --> 32:12.210
I intend to teach you everything I know as a Wave-user.

32:12.210 --> 32:13.590
Aaron-sama!

32:13.910 --> 32:14.950
The Wave is within us.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.240
Believe in your Wave.

32:54.970 --> 32:55.750
Lucario.

32:59.140 --> 32:59.530
Leen-sama!

33:01.230 --> 33:03.240
I am not Leen.

33:04.810 --> 33:08.440
Queen Leen is my ancestor.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.460
My name is Eileen.

33:18.060 --> 33:20.470
You have been asleep all this time.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.390
I've been asleep?

33:22.620 --> 33:24.350
Time has passed.

33:25.540 --> 33:27.600
Impossible...

33:27.600 --> 33:30.810
This room was ours just yesterday...

33:31.330 --> 33:34.740
It might feel like it was yesterday to you, however...

33:34.740 --> 33:38.410
For us, it happened long ago.

33:43.980 --> 33:48.490
We heard that you disappeared within the battle.

33:48.490 --> 33:51.080
What happened exactly?

33:51.080 --> 33:53.380
Two troops closed in on us

33:53.380 --> 33:56.090
and attempted to get this castle caught up in the fight.

33:56.550 --> 33:59.050
I was sent out as a scout.

33:59.050 --> 33:59.920
But...

33:59.920 --> 34:03.200
It was already too late to stop the fight.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.620
The Hero Aaron stopped that, didn't he?

34:05.620 --> 34:06.470
What?

34:06.470 --> 34:10.750
According to the legend, Aaron saved the castle.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.150
That couldn't...

34:12.150 --> 34:13.360
Is that wrong?

34:14.060 --> 34:17.100
Aaron-sama abandoned the castle and ran.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.150
And he sealed me away...

34:19.150 --> 34:20.920
This might be different from the legend.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.870
What's this all about?

34:27.810 --> 34:31.889
There's no way to tell the truth now.

34:31.889 --> 34:34.130
What should I do?

34:34.670 --> 34:35.719
Lucario.

34:35.719 --> 34:39.690
You're free to stay here until you've sorted out your feelings.

34:39.690 --> 34:42.300
Aldoran Castle welcomes you.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.330
My Queen.

34:45.330 --> 34:47.060
I'm grateful.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.440
I'm Satoshi.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.230
Did you mistake me for someone?

34:51.940 --> 34:53.010
Aaron?

34:53.010 --> 34:54.870
Oh, because of these clothes?

34:54.870 --> 34:55.719
No.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.260
Your Wave is the same as Aaron's.

34:59.910 --> 35:02.270
We haven't seen that Pokemon before, have we?

35:03.300 --> 35:06.490
They said that Pokemon's been sealed away for hundreds of years!

35:06.780 --> 35:09.000
I want! I want him!

35:09.000 --> 35:10.410
There's trouble!

35:11.180 --> 35:12.140
Mew was...!

35:12.140 --> 35:13.300
What's wrong?

35:13.300 --> 35:14.480
Mew was...

35:14.480 --> 35:15.840
Mew was here!

35:16.160 --> 35:17.070
My!

35:17.070 --> 35:19.600
So this boy saw Mew!

35:19.600 --> 35:22.760
Those who see Mew are said to be granted happiness.

35:23.030 --> 35:24.550
That's not it!

35:24.550 --> 35:25.840
What is it?!

35:25.840 --> 35:29.150
Mew disappeared with Pikachu and Nyasu!

35:30.070 --> 35:30.600
Mew?

35:32.560 --> 35:33.520
A Pokemon?

35:33.800 --> 35:38.010
This is Lucario, a Pokemon the Hero Aaron had sealed away.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.350
He just woke up.

35:39.350 --> 35:40.840
No way!

35:40.840 --> 35:42.650
Did you really see Mew?

35:42.650 --> 35:44.080
Are you mistaking things?

35:44.080 --> 35:45.450
I saw it too.

35:45.890 --> 35:48.870
From a tower I was touring, I saw Mew take Pikachu and Nyasu,

35:48.870 --> 35:51.640
then it transformed into Pidgeot and flew away.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.290
Why did Mew do that?

35:53.760 --> 35:55.250
It was probably a prank.

35:55.250 --> 35:59.210
Mew occasionally appears in this castle and plays pranks.

35:59.830 --> 36:03.630
He often takes toys, but he's never returned them.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.490
He took Nyasu too?

36:06.490 --> 36:09.930
We planned to steal Pokemon, but our own got stolen instead.

36:09.930 --> 36:12.060
Well, that's not what I meant...

36:12.510 --> 36:14.370
Please tell me where Mew is!

36:14.370 --> 36:16.650
I'm going to find Pikachu!

36:34.170 --> 36:36.780
That appears to be a large tree,

36:36.780 --> 36:39.120
but it is actually an enormous, stone mountain.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.080
That might be amazing.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.840
We call that the Tree of World's Origin.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.760
The Tree of World's Origin.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.550
Mew lives there.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.440
All right.

36:53.440 --> 36:57.790
But Mew has the ability to transform into any Pokemon,

36:57.790 --> 37:01.610
so it rarely shows its true form to anyone.

37:01.980 --> 37:04.240
So how can we find it?

37:04.970 --> 37:08.230
Lucario can read the Wave of all things.

37:08.230 --> 37:11.160
He is said to be able to guide the Hero even in bleak darkness.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.760
Lucario, you will be able to find Mew, right?

37:15.760 --> 37:16.620
Yes.

37:17.270 --> 37:19.830
Will you lend your power to Satoshi?

37:20.740 --> 37:22.930
If the Queen wishes for it.

37:23.630 --> 37:24.520
Satoshi-kun.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.260
I'll lend you a hand too.

37:27.590 --> 37:28.790
Kid-san!

37:29.640 --> 37:32.910
You're that adventurer, Kid Summers!

37:34.010 --> 37:37.270
I've been next to you all this time, but I never realized it!

37:37.820 --> 37:39.360
I have failed!

37:39.360 --> 37:42.430
I am deeply, deeply regretful!

37:42.430 --> 37:44.990
I'm so honored to meet you!

37:44.990 --> 37:46.000
She's famous?

37:47.020 --> 37:47.850
Certainly!

37:49.160 --> 37:50.830
According to my ranking book,

37:50.830 --> 37:53.120
she's quite high up!

37:53.980 --> 37:57.180
The record for the quicket trip around the world in a hot-air balloon,

37:57.180 --> 38:00.660
the record for the deepest independent submarine dive,

38:00.660 --> 38:03.920
the longest solo space walk, and it goes on!

38:03.920 --> 38:06.530
She holds various world records.

38:06.530 --> 38:08.500
She's a super woman!

38:09.780 --> 38:11.120
Wow!

38:11.120 --> 38:14.000
I'll feel safe with someone like you around!

38:14.300 --> 38:15.490
Please!

38:15.750 --> 38:18.060
I would also like you to help.

38:21.710 --> 38:22.620
Actually,

38:22.620 --> 38:26.550
I came here to go to the Tree of World's Origin

38:26.550 --> 38:28.030
and unlock its mystery.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.850
Is that so?!

38:30.850 --> 38:33.010
I'd go with you even if you didn't ask.

38:33.010 --> 38:33.840
Roger!

38:34.910 --> 38:37.470
Then you will depart tomorrow morning.

38:37.470 --> 38:40.840
Pikachu must be playing with Mew right now.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.210
I hope so...

39:11.870 --> 39:13.250
What are you doing?!

39:14.210 --> 39:17.280
Be quiet. It's only because you were standing behind me.

39:19.260 --> 39:20.720
I'm counting on you tomorrow.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.760
I absolutely have to find Pikachu.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.530
Are you that Pikachu's master?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.590
Master?

39:28.410 --> 39:29.940
It's not like that.

39:29.940 --> 39:31.510
Pikachu and I are friends.

39:32.510 --> 39:33.930
Friends?

39:34.700 --> 39:38.370
If your friend disappeared, you'd look for him too, right?

39:38.960 --> 39:42.090
I'm guiding you on the Queen's orders.

39:46.610 --> 39:47.960
What's with him?

40:21.270 --> 40:24.550
May the Wave protect them.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.810
It's as if we're in the clouds.

40:41.810 --> 40:44.330
Lucario's fine in this, isn't he?

40:44.330 --> 40:46.060
He's using the Wave.

40:46.060 --> 40:47.400
Wave?

40:48.130 --> 40:52.720
Hey, didn't Lucario say that Satoshi's Wave was the same as Aaron's?

40:52.720 --> 40:53.850
That's right.

40:53.850 --> 40:55.650
Just what is a Wave?

40:55.650 --> 40:58.790
Everything has this thing called a Wave within them.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.180
Then there's a Wave within me too!

41:01.180 --> 41:04.150
People normally call them something like chi or auras, right?

41:04.150 --> 41:06.270
And Lucario can see those!

41:06.870 --> 41:07.760
Yes.

41:07.760 --> 41:13.860
In legendary times, people who mastered the Wave were called Wave-users.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.550
Aaron was one of them.

41:24.100 --> 41:27.510
If this Aaron's Wave was the same as Satoshi's...

41:27.670 --> 41:30.110
Maybe Satoshi can use the Wave!

41:30.110 --> 41:31.180
Maybe!

41:33.890 --> 41:34.960
Maybe not.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.860
No good.

42:15.390 --> 42:16.950
What's that...

42:17.740 --> 42:19.640
He'll wake up eventually.

42:36.270 --> 42:38.030
It's all done!

42:38.030 --> 42:39.510
This is Satoshi's.

42:39.510 --> 42:40.180
Here.

42:40.180 --> 42:41.760
This is Masato's.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.160
Here.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.420
This is Haruka's.

42:43.420 --> 42:43.890
Here!

42:43.890 --> 42:45.210
This is Kid-sa...

42:45.210 --> 42:45.960
Huh?

42:47.870 --> 42:49.570
What Pokemon is this?

42:50.730 --> 42:51.470
Hey!

42:51.470 --> 42:53.080
That's Kid-san's!

42:56.930 --> 42:57.930
You made it cry!

42:57.930 --> 42:59.590
Bullying's not nice!

43:00.080 --> 43:01.600
This is Usohachi!

43:01.600 --> 43:03.340
It specializes in fake crying!

43:05.780 --> 43:06.100
Hey!

43:13.230 --> 43:15.070
Don't take other people's belongings.

43:15.070 --> 43:16.130
Have this instead.

44:24.820 --> 44:27.190
This feels kind of nice.

45:17.910 --> 45:19.370
What was that?

45:40.040 --> 45:42.000
It's huge!

46:19.860 --> 46:21.560
Geysers.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.770
We'll have to wait until they calm down.

46:26.270 --> 46:27.130
That's...

46:27.580 --> 46:28.810
A hotspring?

46:35.990 --> 46:37.630
So relaxing...

46:46.340 --> 46:47.920
You followed us.

46:48.650 --> 46:50.120
Why don't you come in with us?

46:53.310 --> 46:54.510
Usohachi!

46:57.750 --> 47:01.110
Usohachi's a rock type, so it's not good with water.

47:01.110 --> 47:01.840
No way!

47:06.220 --> 47:10.260
I wish Pikachu could be with us in this hotspring too.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.330
He'd definitely be happy.

47:12.330 --> 47:12.800
Yeah.

47:27.510 --> 47:28.560
Lucario.

47:28.560 --> 47:30.410
Put your feet in too.

47:30.410 --> 47:31.780
It feels nice.

47:31.780 --> 47:33.820
I'll pass.

47:33.820 --> 47:35.270
Don't hold back.

47:36.100 --> 47:36.960
Then...

47:43.120 --> 47:43.870
Right?

47:44.470 --> 47:45.080
Yes.

47:50.970 --> 47:51.910
Lucario!

47:53.230 --> 47:54.570
Come in!

47:54.570 --> 47:55.610
It feels great!

47:55.730 --> 47:57.140
It feels great!

48:07.000 --> 48:08.640
What's with him?

48:08.640 --> 48:10.700
Maybe he doesn't like hotsprings?

48:10.700 --> 48:11.520
Satoshi!

48:11.520 --> 48:12.240
Over here!

48:13.200 --> 48:14.420
What's up, Haruka?

48:15.860 --> 48:16.790
Look there!

48:18.220 --> 48:20.240
Is that a flower?

48:20.240 --> 48:21.330
I'll take a look.

48:24.620 --> 48:26.460
Satoshi's pretty flexible.

48:26.460 --> 48:28.040
Like an Aipom.

48:47.150 --> 48:49.870
You shouldn't pick out the flowers from the mountain.

48:50.520 --> 48:51.570
Sorry.

48:51.570 --> 48:53.020
Well, it couldn't be helped.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.000
Let's re-plant it later.

48:56.000 --> 48:56.590
Yeah.

49:02.770 --> 49:04.410
This is a Time flower.

49:04.410 --> 49:05.870
Time flower?

49:05.870 --> 49:10.430
This flower shows a miracle of time for Wave-users.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.390
Will this be okay?

49:31.390 --> 49:32.320
Sure.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.450
Haruka, give it to me.

49:34.450 --> 49:34.730
Here.

49:39.960 --> 49:40.570
What?

49:58.100 --> 49:59.250
What was that?

49:59.690 --> 50:01.300
It's a Time flower.

50:01.300 --> 50:02.510
A Time flower?

50:02.890 --> 50:08.180
According to the legends, it reveals a miracle of time for Wave-users...

50:08.180 --> 50:09.440
So this is what they meant.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.400
How mysterious.

50:11.400 --> 50:16.480
The miracle must've happened because Satoshi and Aaron share the same Wave.

50:20.940 --> 50:25.920
Pikachu and I weren't like this when we first met.

50:25.920 --> 50:26.740
Is that so?

50:27.710 --> 50:29.810
We didn't get along at all.

50:29.810 --> 50:32.280
I got shocked by his electricity so many times.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.030
How did you become friends?

50:34.030 --> 50:35.160
Tell us!

50:35.160 --> 50:39.170
I want to know how you and Pikachu became friends too, Satoshi!

50:40.450 --> 50:43.300
One day on our journey, a flock of Onisuzume attacked us...

50:44.930 --> 50:49.510
and we became friends thanks to overcoming that hardship together.

51:04.560 --> 51:05.830
So that's what happened.

51:06.450 --> 51:09.760
From then on, Pikachu trusted me,

51:09.760 --> 51:11.750
and I trust Pikachu too.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.780
You should be able to do it too.

51:24.780 --> 51:26.470
I trust you, Lucario.

51:44.740 --> 51:45.840
All right, that's enough!

52:02.340 --> 52:04.290
What's with all this trust?!

52:05.130 --> 52:06.730
People can't be trusted!

52:08.170 --> 52:09.430
Wait a second!

52:11.890 --> 52:13.470
Are you talking about me?

52:13.470 --> 52:16.850
If it becomes inconvenient for you, you might abandon Pikachu.

52:17.150 --> 52:19.570
I'll never abandon Pikachu!

52:21.020 --> 52:22.040
How would you know?

52:24.210 --> 52:27.430
Besides, someone called a legendary hero

52:27.430 --> 52:30.460
couldn't possibly have abandoned his Pokemon!

52:30.460 --> 52:32.330
You're just spouting nonsense!

52:33.150 --> 52:34.080
What?!

52:34.780 --> 52:36.130
Stop it!

52:36.130 --> 52:37.200
But this guy...

52:37.200 --> 52:43.170
Maybe Pikachu ran off because he was fed up with staying with a master like you.

52:44.260 --> 52:45.130
What did you say?!

52:51.600 --> 52:52.410
Satoshi!

52:52.780 --> 52:53.640
Cut it out!

53:04.470 --> 53:05.280
Stop fighting!

53:17.190 --> 53:19.680
They've started fighting among themselves.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.230
Who cares about that? I'm hungry.

53:22.230 --> 53:22.970
I'll go fi...

53:22.970 --> 53:23.550
No!

53:24.840 --> 53:26.630
Don't open it...

53:31.100 --> 53:32.770
Satoshi, you said too much.

53:32.770 --> 53:33.820
But...

53:33.820 --> 53:35.930
He said Pikachu ran away from me.

53:36.680 --> 53:39.920
That's because you said some rude things to Lucario.

53:43.880 --> 53:44.360
Yeah.

53:54.850 --> 53:56.700
I bet you've never had this before.

54:01.070 --> 54:01.630
Here.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.210
It's called chocolate.

54:04.210 --> 54:05.050
Chocolate?

54:05.990 --> 54:10.670
They say it's good to eat sweet things when you're upset or irritated.

54:21.800 --> 54:22.400
Right?

54:41.330 --> 54:42.970
I'm at peace...

54:54.180 --> 54:58.150
It's about time you got back to that brat boy and the others, isn't it?

55:10.020 --> 55:11.490
He wants to play some more.

55:16.100 --> 55:17.920
Wait until the morning.

55:44.070 --> 55:45.150
Pikachu.

56:25.440 --> 56:27.440
Lucario, what's wrong?

56:31.960 --> 56:34.910
This is where I was sealed away.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.020
Why?

56:46.990 --> 56:48.110
Why?

56:54.600 --> 56:55.590
A Time flower...

57:04.320 --> 57:05.540
Aaron-sama!

58:10.900 --> 58:12.400
Stop it, Lucario!

58:12.400 --> 58:13.590
These aren't real!

58:30.350 --> 58:32.120
That was scary.

58:32.120 --> 58:35.030
This was a battlefield in the past.

58:37.060 --> 58:40.060
Lucario was telling the truth.

58:40.060 --> 58:43.240
Does that mean the legend was wrong?

58:43.240 --> 58:47.510
But Aaron didn't seem like a bad person.

58:47.510 --> 58:52.030
Maybe he sealed Lucario to protect him from those troops?

58:56.130 --> 58:57.070
Why?

59:08.090 --> 59:08.720
Sorry.

59:11.080 --> 59:14.560
I sad all those rude things without knowing your feelings...

59:18.880 --> 59:19.750
Sorry.

59:22.780 --> 59:24.290
Satoshi.

59:24.290 --> 59:26.580
Never abandon Pikachu.

59:29.160 --> 59:29.830
I know.

59:36.430 --> 59:37.310
Lucario!

59:41.440 --> 59:43.010
Hey, what's wrong, Lucario?

59:54.770 --> 59:55.570
Regirock!

59:57.860 --> 59:58.700
What's going on?

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.490
Everyone, this way!

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:16.890
Let's go!

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.410
In here.

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:05.580
I wonder if they reached the Tree of World's Origin.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:13.180
Why did Regirock come out and attack us?

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:15.600
It told us not to get closer.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:16.870
It was a warning?

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:23.280
It might be protecting the Tree of World's Origin from intruders.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.270
This is...

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.420
The lowest level of the Tree of World's Origin, isn't it?

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.440
Then, Pikachu is...

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.390
Above us.

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:26.950
All right. I'm coming, Pikachu!

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:28.590
Do you know where you're going?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.110
Either way, we're just going up!

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:32.320
Right, Lucario?

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.190
For now.

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:34.060
All right!

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.810
Ah, Satoshi!

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.480
What are those?

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.770
Survey modules.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.380
Survey modules?

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.460
I'm gathering more data around here.

01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:48.190
Banks, time for work.

01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.040
Wake up.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.230
I've been waiting, my lady.

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.860
Look.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.450
The Tree of World's Origin has, for thousands...

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:04.210
No, for tens of thousands of years, protected Pokemon here from outside interference.

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:06.210
Congratulations on the new discovery.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.650
Save the celebrations for when we solve everything.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.380
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.890
I'm counting on you to analyze the data.

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:13.190
As you wish.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.650
I'm getting excited!

01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:17.680
Me too!

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.570
I'm getting pretty excited too!

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.090
This is a treasure mountain swarming with rare Pokemon!

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:33.040
No, an underground treasure!

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.670
This stone mountain is alive!

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:31.900
It is a mineral lifeform created by nature.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:38.260
The Tree of World's Origin has been living off of light energy for tens of thousands of years.

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:40.710
An amazing discovery!

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.570
Yeah.

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:43.450
But...

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.020
The mystery hasn't been solved yet.

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:51.920
Mew must have some connection to the Tree of World's Origin.

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.330
Hey!

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.810
Pikachu!

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:23.100
I'm over here!

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.630
What?

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.050
Pikachu!

01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:39.310
If you're there, answer!

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:40.870
Pikachu!

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.620
Pikachu!

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:53.570
Pikachu!

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.060
I'm coming now!

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.650
Regice!

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:19.130
We're not enemies!

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:20.740
We're only here to look for a friend!

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.860
It doesn't look like someone you can convince.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.580
Let's go back!

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.210
Lucario!

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.880
What's going on...

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:43.310
Everyone, run!

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:44.440
What's wrong?

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.380
It's Regice!

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.060
It's here!

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.170
We'll find another path!

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:03.740
In here!

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:18.880
Someone!

01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:20.660
Save us!

01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:26.600
Team Rocket?

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.250
I don't care if it's brat boy or whatever!

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:33.020
Do something about those guys!

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:41.590
Everyone, this way!

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:47.020
Registeel's here too!

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.729
That's...

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:26.870
Musashi! Kojiro!

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:16.460
Musashi, wait up!

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:20.819
Geez, you're such a slowpoke.

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:22.370
I'll leave you behind!

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:23.340
Behind you!

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.910
Now wait here.

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:28.060
Come on, we're not kids.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:29.260
That won't...

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.300
W-What's this?!

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:32.700
Go, Sabonea!

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.180
Sabonea, Pin Missile!

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.080
It didn't work?

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.740
What's that?!

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:51.870
I really don't like this feeling!

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.080
Musashi!

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.520
Kojiro...

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.400
Chiriin!

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.180
Get away from here!

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:17.490
What's going on here?

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.730
They're here again!

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.480
It's coming!

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.210
Now, while we still have time!

01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:50.130
Okay.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.980
Banks, what is this?

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:12.020
This is likely what can be seen as the Tree of World's Origin's immune system.

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.820
It's trying to get rid of the bacteria inside it.

01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:17.430
Bacteria?

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.800
You mean us?

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.230
No way!

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:23.250
That's the proof that this Tree of World's Origin is alive.

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.840
Banks, find an escape route for us.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.760
I am.

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:33.920
Wait for a little longer.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:38.860
Watch out!

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:42.850
Lucario!

01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:49.570
Pokemon aren't treated as bacteria.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.790
I'll hold them back.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.880
Kid-san, take care of everyone.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.260
I got it.

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.210
That way!

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.370
Lucario.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:12.510
Until you meet with Pikachu...

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.670
I'll stay with you.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.220
Thanks.

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:29.760
Jupitol, Bullet Seed!

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.170
Heigani, Bubblebeam!

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.070
All right.

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.850
Let's go!

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:45.550
This way, this way!

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:22.880
What?

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:53.600
Masato!

01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:55.170
Onee-chan!

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.330
You guys, run!

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.170
Takeshi!

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:08.180
Masato!

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.000
Everyone, come out!

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.600
How horrible...

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:53.350
Pikachu's voice!

01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:58.920
Satoshi?

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:18.830
Pikachu!

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.190
Pikachu!

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:39.420
Wait right there!

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:35.560
Pikachu!

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:50.730
Kid-san!

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:55.760
Pikachu!

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:57.710
Satoshi!

01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:02.410
I met up with Pikachu.

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.350
Pikachu, this is Lucario.

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.560
He guided us all the way here.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.030
Mew!

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.180
Mew just wanted to play!

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:17.980
Nyasu!

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:25.220
Thanks.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.250
Regice.

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:35.130
We should get out of here.

01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:35.690
Let's go!

01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:36.260
Heigani!

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:36.770
Jupitol!

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.590
Kid-san, what about the others?

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.500
Everyone was sucked up by those things...

01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:55.440
Musashi and Kojiro too?

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:57.390
Oh no!

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.170
This way!

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:16.150
My lady, the escape route is right above you!

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:16.790
Roger!

01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:20.150
Sunlight!

01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:22.130
We'll make it!

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.470
It's above this!

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:35.930
Lucario!

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.480
Satoshi.

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.950
You guys get out of here.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:00.480
Pikachu, sorry.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.250
Just when I met up with you...

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:05.790
This tree sees us as intruders...

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:13.770
Satoshi!

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.080
Pikachu!

01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:17.920
Okay!

01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:20.840
Okay, I got it!

01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:40.420
Kid-san, just what...

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:45.200
Mew told the tree that you guys weren't bacteria.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:45.870
Mew did?

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:51.510
This Tree of World's Origin and Mew share their powers

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:53.200
and live together in symbiosis.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.180
Mew.

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.080
Thanks.

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.800
Mew!

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:14.430
He's heating up.

01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:22.900
Just when I thought we were saved...

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.080
Doesn't this seem kind of bad?

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.600
Let's find Nyasu and get out of here!

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.500
OW!!

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.270
Kojiro?

01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:42.490
Everyone, come back!

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.010
My lady.

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:49.850
There is an abnormality in the Tree of World's Origin's life signs.

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:51.520
It seems so.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.350
There's a disturbance in its energy flow.

01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:55.830
What do you mean?

01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:01.170
The sudden activity within the immune system might have caused a great deal of damage.

01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:04.520
At this rate, if the energy flow stops,

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.780
the Tree of World's Origin will collapse!

01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:36.060
My Queen, are you all right?

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.610
I am fine.

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.980
But...

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:42.340
I'm worried about the children.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:48.000
Mew and the Tree of World's Origin are one.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.060
That's why when the tree is weak,

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.110
Mew is also...

01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.240
Is he telling us to come with him?

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:35.820
This is...

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.720
Could it be?

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.540
Aaron-sama!

01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:58.700
This is...

01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.700
I see!

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:03.150
Aaron came here by himself after sealing away Lucario.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.180
This has to be the Tree of World's Origin's heart.

01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:16.480
A Time flower.

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.410
Come out, Mew!

01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:39.130
Mew.

01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:42.280
I know that you and this tree are one.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.910
Please, lend me your power!

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.950
The Wave is within me!

01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:56.860
Take my Wave!

01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:28.930
Aaron sacrificed his own life to stop the fight.

01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:31.030
So this was the truth.

01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:36.540
Aaron-sama.

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:52.050
You want me to use my power to save the tree this time?

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.250
All right, I'll...

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.530
Wait, Lucario.

01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:03.560
If you use your Wave here, then you'll follow the same fate as Aaron did.

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.630
I know.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:08.540
Lucario.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.520
The Wave is within me!

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.300
My Wave isn't enough by itself?

01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:28.380
If my Wave is the same as Aaron's, then...

01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:29.140
What?

01:27:35.190 --> 01:27:37.290
I should be able to do it too...

01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:44.630
Don't, Satoshi!

01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:46.480
If you do this, then you'll also...

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:49.540
If we don't do this now, then this tree will collapse,

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:51.520
and all the Pokemon below will die!

01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:54.570
Satoshi...

01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.880
I'll do whatever I can!

01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:47.470
Leave the rest to me!

01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.910
Lucario!

01:28:50.630 --> 01:28:53.380
The Wave is within me!

01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:28.800
Thanks, Mew.

01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:32.450
That's good.

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:33.730
You're all better!

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.210
The tree's life signs have returned to normal.

01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:42.840
Everything's fine now.

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.670
Yeah.

01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:47.260
Banks, keep everything here confidential.

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.810
You won't publicize it?

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.540
Put it away carefully.

01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:52.610
As you wish.

01:30:56.530 --> 01:30:57.430
Lucario!

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.160
Satoshi...

01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:02.860
Lucario.

01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:29.410
Lucario.

01:31:29.410 --> 01:31:30.800
I'm sorry.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.120
Aaron-sama.

01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:35.530
I didn't...

01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:37.790
I didn't have a choice but to seal you away.

01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:40.840
If I hadn't...

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.610
You would've followed me no matter what...

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:48.440
...and followed the same fate as me.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.430
Of course!

01:31:50.890 --> 01:31:52.970
Meaningless fights...

01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:55.360
and throwing away lives...

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.730
Just myself will be enough.

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.480
But...

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.890
I have no regrets.

01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:09.930
In that castle...

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:16.190
I was able to live such beautiful days with you and Leen-sama.

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.910
That's what it means to live.

01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:27.150
I doubted you...

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.780
Thank you...

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:32.770
Lucario.

01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:36.910
Every day I spent with you...

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.270
was a lot of fun...

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.590
Aaron-sama!

01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:44.430
Lucario.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.030
If I could, once more...

01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:52.520
I'd like to see you one more time.

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.070
My friend...

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.310
Aaron-sama!

01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:12.470
I was foolish.

01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:13.650
Lucario.

01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:14.730
That's not it!

01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:17.530
You're a great Wave-user!

01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:18.450
Satoshi.

01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:22.980
Lucario!

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:24.130
Hang in there!

01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:25.110
Don't die!

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:28.170
I won't be dying.

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:33.030
I'll be... going back to Aaron-sama's... side...

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:11.240
Hey, everyone!

01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:13.110
Satoshi!

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.590
Pikachu!

01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:15.580
Kid-san!

01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:19.690
You made it out okay!

01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:20.160
Yeah!

01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:23.000
Kid-sama, I'm so glad you're safe!

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.750
Where's Lucario?

01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:31.830
He...

01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:35.720
He went back to his friend's side.

01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:37.760
Did he...

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.570
It can't be...

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.330

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.020
yuusha

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:23.840
yuusha

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.730
minna

01:39:24.730 --> 01:39:25.440
minna

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.290
minna

01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:47.600
A new curtain rises

01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:50.870
We've come about a roundabout way

01:35:51.570 --> 01:35:55.030
But we finally met

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.600
On my smouldering feelings

01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:03.830
You cast a magic spell

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:08.170
Let's open that heavy door

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.820
Come on, let's go!

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.300
It's the beginning of an adventure

01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:20.290
Look, let's jump out there!

01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:24.200
To the other end of that sky

01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:39.740
The map of the future I imagine

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.050
If I'm with you, I'll always

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:47.140
Do as we please

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.780
Facing these hardships

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.090
This ball of unrelenting strength

01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.270
Let's carry it and walk out

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.050
That's right! Everything began

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.080
Right here

01:37:09.970 --> 01:37:12.540
On this land

01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:15.860
We'll trust so much that it shakes

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.130
No matter how small

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.310
Dreams are, we won't lose them

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.650
In the world out there

01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:28.860
Our friends are waiting

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:35.280
Sometimes a few tears plop out

01:37:35.730 --> 01:37:40.740
On nights like that

01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:48.730
Without sitting still and worrying

01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:55.500
I'll come running

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:24.670
Water, Grass, Electric

01:38:24.670 --> 01:38:27.920
Bug, Bird, Gas

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.920
Rock, Ice, Fire

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.720
Ground, Flying, Psychic

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.990
Normal, Fighting, all of them

01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:47.780
Are my friends, so...

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.730
That's right! Everything began

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.620
Right here

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:57.300
On this land

01:38:57.730 --> 01:39:00.640
We'll trust so much that it shakes

01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:03.680
Everyone, in reality

01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:06.650
Is lonely when they're by themselves

01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:10.170
At this pace

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:13.780
I'll just keep on making friends

01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:14.770
Rapidly

01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:15.610
Rapidly

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:16.390
Courage

01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:17.280
Courage

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.130
Comes forth

01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:18.820
Comes forth

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:19.740
Comes forth

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:20.550
Comes forth

01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:21.360
Gradually

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.200
Gradually

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.020
Heroes

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:23.840
Heroes

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.730
Everyone

01:39:24.730 --> 01:39:25.440
Everyone

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.290
Everyone
