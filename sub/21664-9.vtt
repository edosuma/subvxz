08:49.181 --> 08:50.681
- No, thank you.
I do not eat candy.

08:50.781 --> 08:51.948
- I don't either.

08:52.048 --> 08:53.881
I just offer it to others
as a goodwill gesture.

08:53.981 --> 08:55.181
- Goodbye, Robbie.

08:55.281 --> 08:57.314
I have run out of hands
and require the use

08:57.414 --> 08:59.548
of a table to maximize
my study efficiency.

09:01.681 --> 09:03.381
- [sniffing]

09:04.881 --> 09:06.381
- That was weird.

09:06.548 --> 09:08.581
- His behavior didn't seem
out of the ordinary to me.

09:08.681 --> 09:09.881
- Exactly my point.

09:09.981 --> 09:11.848
He acts like you.

09:11.948 --> 09:16.548
Is it possible he comes
from the same place as you?

09:16.648 --> 09:18.381
- He said he was
from Cleveland, so...

09:18.548 --> 09:22.614
- No. I mean, is it possible
he's an android, too?

09:22.714 --> 09:24.114
- I don't know.

09:24.214 --> 09:26.581
I wasn't programmed
to detect other androids.

09:26.681 --> 09:29.548
- Then it looks like I'll
have to find out myself.

09:37.248 --> 09:38.614
- Hey, Frankie!

09:41.281 --> 09:45.114
Right. I don't exist now that
you don't need rescuing.

09:45.214 --> 09:46.748
- Having girl trouble,
Coleslaw?

09:46.848 --> 09:48.114
- Nah.

09:48.214 --> 09:50.048
In fact, Frankie and I were
together just last night.

09:50.148 --> 09:51.281
- [laughs]

09:51.381 --> 09:53.014
Must have been
some hang out sesh,

09:53.114 --> 09:54.748
if today she's
running from you.

09:54.848 --> 09:56.514
[laughs]

09:59.914 --> 10:01.814
Hey, Frankie Fresh.

10:01.914 --> 10:03.248
- Hello, Andrew LaPierre.

10:03.348 --> 10:04.681
- Why don't you
put that down,

10:04.781 --> 10:06.414
so everybody can see
those eyes of yours?

10:06.514 --> 10:07.914
- FRANKIE: Finishing this
book is my priority.

10:08.014 --> 10:09.281
- Wow. You must
really be into it.

10:09.381 --> 10:10.414
What are you reading?

10:10.514 --> 10:11.914
- Advanced mechanical
engineering.

10:12.014 --> 10:13.548
Flue dynamics
and energy transfer.

10:18.248 --> 10:20.681
- Wow. She really
doesn't like you.

10:20.781 --> 10:22.081
- Yes, she does.

10:22.181 --> 10:23.848
- She has a funny
way of showing it.

10:23.948 --> 10:26.014
- COLE:
[sighing]

10:26.114 --> 10:27.681
- [clears throat]

10:32.881 --> 10:33.981
- DAYTON:
I'll be home by dinner.

10:34.081 --> 10:37.214
I'm at, uh, Frankie's.

10:39.081 --> 10:40.414
Yeah, I will.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.948
Bye, Cole.

10:42.048 --> 10:43.881
Cole says hey.

10:43.981 --> 10:47.214
Actually he says,
whaddup?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.414
But more sad than that.
- FRANKIE: Sad?

10:49.514 --> 10:51.114
I know this is what
I'm experiencing,

10:51.214 --> 10:52.548
but I do not know why.

10:52.648 --> 10:54.781
- Life sure would be easier,
if you were a real girl.

10:54.881 --> 10:57.314
Cole would stop moping,
you'd stop being sad.

10:57.414 --> 10:59.114
- Then it is settled.
- What is?

10:59.214 --> 11:01.581
- I must become
a real girl.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.914
- Well, hello,
Mr. Grumpy Whiskers.

11:08.014 --> 11:10.114
Welcome to my pop-up
cat café.

11:10.214 --> 11:11.914
It's good to see you
outside the kiddie cooler.

11:12.014 --> 11:13.414
- Is that cat
drinking coffee?

11:13.548 --> 11:15.848
- Oh, don't be silly.
My cats don't drink coffee.

11:15.948 --> 11:19.748
This is a decaf feline latte,
made with organic saucer milk.

11:19.848 --> 11:20.981
- Have you seen Tammy?

11:21.081 --> 11:22.614
I'm supposed to meet
her for a tutoring session.

11:22.714 --> 11:24.848
- I thought Frankie
was your tutor?

11:26.114 --> 11:27.548
Oh, what a shame.

11:28.948 --> 11:32.414
- Oh! Here we are again...
Like we're meant to be.

11:32.548 --> 11:34.548
It must be our chemistry.

11:34.648 --> 11:37.214
- I'm here to talk math,
not science.

11:37.314 --> 11:39.181
- Whaddup, Tam-Tam?

11:40.681 --> 11:42.148
- BRB.

11:43.814 --> 11:45.448
- Tammy, I need
to study.

11:48.548 --> 11:50.181
Hey, Tammy, can we get
back to work?

11:50.281 --> 11:52.248
I could really use your
help factoring quadratics.

11:52.348 --> 11:54.114
- In a second, Cole.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.014
Someone can't take a hint.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.248
- Doesn't this guy
ever get tired

11:57.348 --> 11:58.981
of getting blown
off by girls?

11:59.081 --> 12:00.414
- You wanna say
that again?

12:00.548 --> 12:02.614
To my face?
- [laughs]

12:09.940 --> 12:12.073
- Boys! Boys!
Don't fight over me.

12:12.173 --> 12:13.940
- Why don't you just
stay out of my business?

12:14.040 --> 12:15.540
- Why don't you just
give up on Frankie?

12:15.640 --> 12:17.173
She's obviously
not into you.

12:17.273 --> 12:18.640
- Are you kidding me?

12:18.740 --> 12:20.373
- [bells jingling]
- What the heck?

12:20.473 --> 12:23.007
- That is what I do when
Puff Catty and Anderson Pooper

12:23.107 --> 12:25.007
decide they don't
want to get along.

12:25.107 --> 12:26.640
- We're not cats,
Miss Hough.

12:26.740 --> 12:28.807
- Well, you sure are
fighting like cats.

12:28.907 --> 12:31.307
Now both of you,
back to your litter boxes.

12:34.673 --> 12:36.540
- [cats screeching]

12:36.640 --> 12:39.407
- [hissing]
Boys! Behave!

12:39.507 --> 12:40.907
- A real girl?

12:40.940 --> 12:42.773
- I believe I already
have a head start.

12:42.907 --> 12:44.240
Androids aren't supposed
to be capable of

12:44.340 --> 12:47.707
feeling things like sadness,
like-liking a boy,

12:47.807 --> 12:49.640
or the feeling I get
from being with you,

12:49.740 --> 12:52.773
Dayton Reyes, my BFF.
- Aww.

12:52.907 --> 12:55.940
- But I do feel those things
and I want to feel more.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.540
I want to be
a real girl.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.240
- But how can
you do it?

12:59.340 --> 13:01.073
There are so many
aspects of being human,

13:01.173 --> 13:03.073
besides the emotional side.

13:03.173 --> 13:07.707
There's the physical,
mental, fashionable.

13:07.807 --> 13:09.007
- I'm not sure.

13:09.107 --> 13:10.673
It will certainly
be a complex process,

13:10.773 --> 13:12.040
but worth it,

13:12.140 --> 13:15.107
especially if it means Cole
and I are no longer sad.

13:18.907 --> 13:20.907
- Frankie, I'm supposed
to empty the dishwasher

13:20.940 --> 13:23.107
before mom gets home,
so don't forget.

13:23.207 --> 13:25.473
And don't do too
good a job.

13:25.573 --> 13:27.407
I'm only human,
remember?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.907
- I have a great deal
to learn about being human.

13:31.007 --> 13:33.273
Is it really true that making
mistakes is required?

13:33.373 --> 13:35.973
- Well, it's not so much
that it's required.

13:36.073 --> 13:38.207
It's more that
we can't help it.

13:38.307 --> 13:39.407
- I understand.

13:39.507 --> 13:41.640
Is that why your top
does not match your skirt?

13:41.740 --> 13:43.707
- This is a look!

13:43.807 --> 13:46.140
Besides,
it was laundry day.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.140
It's all I had
that was clean.

13:50.573 --> 13:51.607
- KINGSTON:
I'm sorry, son.

13:51.707 --> 13:52.640
No, no, no, no, no.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.073
Of course, I want
to watch you play.

13:54.173 --> 13:56.973
I'm just... I'm jammed
up at work right now.

13:58.473 --> 14:01.740
Good luck and... hey,
let me know how it goes.

14:01.907 --> 14:05.040
[chuckles]
All right, bye.

14:05.973 --> 14:07.240
- PEGSI: You've got mail,
Mr. Kingston.

14:07.340 --> 14:08.907
- I get mail all day
and all night.

14:09.007 --> 14:10.707
Big whoop.
- It's from WARPA.

14:10.807 --> 14:12.173
- W-W-WARPA?

14:12.273 --> 14:13.973
What are you waiting for?
Read it to me.

14:14.073 --> 14:15.773
- "Kingston,
we are very disappointed

14:15.907 --> 14:17.640
"about the continued
delays with Project Q.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.173
"We'll be at your
office in two days.

14:19.273 --> 14:20.773
"Failure to deliver
would not be good

14:20.907 --> 14:22.973
for our relationship
or your health."

14:23.073 --> 14:26.607
- We have made no significant
progress on Project Q,

14:26.707 --> 14:29.973
you round mound
of annoying sound.

14:30.073 --> 14:31.473
Well, get to work.

14:31.573 --> 14:35.307
We only have a few days
to find that android, or...

14:35.407 --> 14:39.007
or it will not be
good for your health, hmph.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.240
- [laughs]

14:44.340 --> 14:46.473
Well, now this is
the Jenny I know.

14:46.573 --> 14:49.640
Jenny! When I ask you
to unload the dishwasher,

14:49.740 --> 14:52.240
I expect you to do it.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.707
- What are you talking
about, Mom?

14:54.807 --> 14:56.640
- The dishes, Jenny.
Where are they?

14:56.740 --> 14:59.773
- [plates smashing]
- Found them.

14:59.907 --> 15:01.407
- Care to explain?

15:01.507 --> 15:02.640
- Uh... Frankie did it.

15:02.740 --> 15:05.040
- Frankie, did you put
the dishes in the freezer?

15:05.140 --> 15:06.740
- That is correct, mom.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.207
- [laughing]
Good one, Frankie.

15:09.307 --> 15:11.407
- That's right.
It was a joke.

15:11.507 --> 15:13.573
I was trying to teach
her how to make a joke.

15:13.673 --> 15:16.073
Right, Frankie?
[laughing]

15:16.173 --> 15:17.707
Oh, pretty funny,
Frankie.

15:17.807 --> 15:19.273
- WILL & JENNY:
[laughing]

15:19.373 --> 15:22.707
- I think she nailed it.
- JENNY: [laughing]

15:22.807 --> 15:24.307
- FRANKIE: Ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha!

15:24.407 --> 15:26.073
- JENNY & WILL:
[continue laughing]

15:28.773 --> 15:31.540
- Did she just
take my moose mug?

15:31.640 --> 15:32.940
Sig, wait up!

15:33.040 --> 15:35.373
You know I can't drink
juice without my moose mug.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.273
- What do you think
you're trying to do?

15:38.373 --> 15:39.940
- I was just following
your direction

15:40.040 --> 15:41.607
and not doing your
chores perfectly.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.073
- I didn't mean
that wrong.

15:43.173 --> 15:44.907
Can't you do my chores
wrong, the right way?

15:44.940 --> 15:46.473
- Perhaps,
if you teach me.

15:46.573 --> 15:48.440
- That would defeat the whole
purpose of our arrangement.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.907
Just don't blow this,

15:49.940 --> 15:52.740
or I'll have to tell Mom about
Dayton knowing your secret.

15:54.773 --> 15:57.507
- How long did the Anglo-
Zanzibar War of 1896 last?

15:57.607 --> 15:58.773
- Thirty-eight minutes.

15:58.907 --> 16:00.473
It was the shortest
war in history.

16:00.573 --> 16:01.707
Next question.

16:01.807 --> 16:03.040
- Let's see...

16:03.140 --> 16:04.540
Whoa!
- [spray can rattles]

16:07.407 --> 16:09.673
- What's that doing
on the ground?

16:11.707 --> 16:13.040
Let's go clean that off.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.540
It could stain
your silicone skin.

16:21.573 --> 16:23.607
- Miss Gaines! Freeze!

16:23.707 --> 16:26.673
- Mr. Manhart! This is
not what it looks like.

16:26.773 --> 16:29.973
- It looks like Miss Gaines
has vandalized school property

16:30.073 --> 16:33.173
and finds it amusing.

16:33.273 --> 16:36.240
This is no time for
games, Miss... Gaines.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.040
Vandalism is punishable
by expulsion.

16:39.140 --> 16:42.107
You're in some serious
trouble, young lady.

16:43.476 --> 16:45.943
- What do you have to say
for yourself, Miss Gaines?

16:47.910 --> 16:49.210
- You can unfreeze now.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.676
The can was on the ground.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.110
Frankie just picked it up
because I tripped over it.

16:54.576 --> 16:56.176
- A likely story.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.943
But, since I've literally
caught you red-handed,

16:58.043 --> 16:59.543
I have no choice
but to turn you in.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.610
- Will this take long?
I really need to study.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.243
- Oh, let's go.

17:09.576 --> 17:11.810
- [cellphone ringing]

17:13.810 --> 17:15.310
- Dr. Gaines.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.675
Ah, yes.
Hello, Miss Hough.

17:18.810 --> 17:20.710
Frankie did what?

17:20.810 --> 17:22.343
Are you sure?

17:22.443 --> 17:25.109
Expulsion?

17:25.210 --> 17:28.576
Uh... uh...
I understand.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.510
Oh, Frankie...

17:34.610 --> 17:37.176
I hope our time together
isn't coming to an end.

17:38.243 --> 17:39.810
- Would you quit studying
for a minute.

17:39.876 --> 17:41.310
This is really serious.

17:41.410 --> 17:43.110
- I have parallel processing,
so I can multitask.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.510
- You could get expelled
for vandalism.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.843
- They would not do that.
I'm innocent.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.343
- You know that and I know that,
but the school doesn't.

17:50.443 --> 17:53.010
We need to find the guilty
party and clear your name.

17:53.110 --> 17:55.076
- But who is
the guilty party?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.076
- I have my suspect.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.343
Have you ever heard of

18:00.443 --> 18:02.410
the great English computer
scientist Alan Turing?

18:02.510 --> 18:04.510
He invented...
- The Turing Test.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.810
A mechanism used to distinguish
between a person and a machine.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.310
- Exactly.

18:08.410 --> 18:11.043
I think it's time
we give Robbie a little quiz

18:11.143 --> 18:13.976
to determine if he is
a person or a machine.

18:14.076 --> 18:15.610
Thank you for
participating in

18:15.710 --> 18:19.076
the Red Carpet
Club survey, Frankie.

18:19.176 --> 18:20.843
Okay, now leave.

18:20.943 --> 18:22.276
Hi, Robbie!

18:22.376 --> 18:25.310
As a new student
who recently experienced

18:25.410 --> 18:26.510
our Red Carpet Club
welcoming service,

18:26.610 --> 18:28.810
we'd like to get your
feedback on how we did.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.443
- We'd be glad to help.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.176
- When you say "we,"
who are you talking about?

18:33.276 --> 18:34.376
- Who are you
talking about?

18:34.476 --> 18:36.010
I thought we were
saying "we" today

18:36.110 --> 18:37.543
because you
keep saying it.

18:37.643 --> 18:39.276
- Right.

18:39.376 --> 18:41.443
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

18:41.543 --> 18:45.076
If I said, shall I compare
thee to a summer's day,

18:45.176 --> 18:46.443
what comes to mind?

18:46.543 --> 18:49.243
- I would say
I'm more of a fall.

18:49.343 --> 18:53.810
- Do the parts of your body ever
function in unexpected ways?

18:53.876 --> 18:55.576
- I once found out that
my nose can function

18:55.676 --> 18:58.310
as a coin purse when
I got a penny stuck in it.

18:58.410 --> 19:00.210
- Thank you for
taking our survey.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.810
- You're quite welcome.

19:02.910 --> 19:06.110
Isn't there anything
else you'd like to ask me?

19:06.210 --> 19:07.176
- Such as?

19:07.276 --> 19:09.343
- If I like you back?

19:14.243 --> 19:15.843
Salutations, Andrew.

19:15.943 --> 19:17.943
I hope you enjoyed
the Red Carpet Club survey.

19:18.043 --> 19:19.443
- Huh?

19:19.543 --> 19:21.810
- Did Dayton not ask you to take
the survey for new students?

19:21.876 --> 19:23.243
- Unh-unh.

19:23.343 --> 19:25.343
Sounds to me like Dayton's
looking for an excuse

19:25.443 --> 19:27.810
to get some extra
Robbie time.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.576
- Oh. Ooh.

19:30.676 --> 19:32.410
[laughs]

19:34.210 --> 19:36.143
- Ugh.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.943
- Okay, Frankie,
I am at a loss.

19:40.043 --> 19:42.076
I can't find any
bad disc sectors,

19:42.176 --> 19:44.576
any bad code, nothing.

19:44.676 --> 19:48.976
- Mom, I did not spray paint
those words on the lockers.

19:49.076 --> 19:51.010
I found the can.

19:51.110 --> 19:52.943
- I want to believe you.

19:53.043 --> 19:54.676
But isn't it a little
coincidental

19:54.776 --> 19:57.976
that someone wrote
"robots rule" on the lockers?

19:58.076 --> 19:59.376
- Seemingly.

19:59.476 --> 20:01.076
Dayton Reyes believes
Robbie Turnbull wrote it.

20:01.176 --> 20:02.743
- And why would
he do that?

20:02.843 --> 20:04.210
- It is unknown.

20:04.310 --> 20:05.776
May I return
to my studies?

20:05.876 --> 20:07.710
I have fallen behind my targeted
pace of knowledge input.

20:07.810 --> 20:11.876
- Frankie, do you understand
how serious this is?

20:11.976 --> 20:15.343
If you're found guilty, they
could expel you from school.

20:15.443 --> 20:16.543
- Since I'm innocent,

20:16.643 --> 20:18.310
I am confident
the truth will come out.

20:18.410 --> 20:20.976
May I go study?
Please?

20:21.076 --> 20:22.643
- Fine.

20:22.743 --> 20:26.176
But until I can figure
out exactly what is going on,

20:26.276 --> 20:27.976
you need to stay
in the house.

20:28.076 --> 20:30.243
- I'm grounded?
Like a human?

20:30.343 --> 20:32.710
- Oh, no, it's just...
[laughs]

20:32.810 --> 20:37.476
a precaution, to keep you
and everyone else safe.

20:42.276 --> 20:43.843
- [doorbell rings]

20:46.243 --> 20:48.010
- I have excellent news,
Dayton Reyes.

20:48.110 --> 20:50.010
I have been grounded.
- Congratulations?

20:50.110 --> 20:51.643
- I recognize
the negative connotation,

20:51.810 --> 20:53.543
but it feels nice to
participate in a human activity.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.643
- What do you want me to do
with these library books?

20:55.810 --> 20:58.343
Should I put 'em on the table,
or do you wanna eat 'em here?

20:58.443 --> 20:59.543
- I don't eat books.

20:59.643 --> 21:01.076
I simply memorize
their contents.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.410
- I know, Frankie.

21:02.510 --> 21:04.310
It just seems like you're
going through them so fast,

21:04.410 --> 21:05.676
it's like you're
consuming them.

21:05.810 --> 21:07.210
- Unfortunately,
it's not fast enough.

21:07.310 --> 21:08.810
At current pace,
it will be impossible

21:08.910 --> 21:10.876
to achieve my knowledge goal
in time for the competition.

21:10.976 --> 21:13.176
- We can do it, Frankie.
We just have to work harder.

21:13.276 --> 21:15.443
- The competition is now
less than two days away,

21:15.543 --> 21:17.543
and even with my multi-
tasking capabilities,

21:17.643 --> 21:19.410
there are still
too many distractions...

21:19.510 --> 21:20.910
Such as dusting mom's lab.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.976
- Still doing Jenny's chores?
- Let's bring the flashcards.

21:32.810 --> 21:33.910
Dayton Reyes!

21:34.010 --> 21:35.943
- I know, I know,
the flashcards. I'm getting...

21:36.043 --> 21:37.176
- I have an idea.

21:37.276 --> 21:38.843
The last time
I used this,

21:38.943 --> 21:41.376
I was able to process
tasks at double the speed.

21:41.476 --> 21:44.110
If I use it to study, I can
absorb data at double the speed.

21:44.210 --> 21:45.376
- I don't know, Frankie.

21:45.476 --> 21:47.543
You said that battery
made you go a little nuts.

21:47.643 --> 21:49.010
It sounds really
dangerous.

21:49.110 --> 21:51.476
- Do you think
it is a mistake...

21:51.576 --> 21:53.010
just like a human
might make?

21:53.110 --> 21:54.143
- But, Frankie...

21:54.243 --> 21:55.476
- You promised to
help me, Dayton Reyes,

21:55.576 --> 21:57.810
and I need your help.
