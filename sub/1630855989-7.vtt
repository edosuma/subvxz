00:37.600 --> 00:41.560
Sauraha, Nepal.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.800
This rhino is not lost.

01:06.160 --> 01:10.240
He is on his way to find food.

01:14.120 --> 01:19.240
To get it, he must travel through
a new and alien world.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.640
This rhino in his lifetime

01:30.640 --> 01:35.360
has seen more changes than
any of his previous generations.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.880
Across the globe,

01:42.880 --> 01:46.440
animals of all kinds
are now contending

01:46.440 --> 01:48.960
with one newly dominant species...

01:50.400 --> 01:51.960
...us.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.720
Like so many wild creatures,
he's had to learn

02:03.720 --> 02:07.960
how to live in the human world.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.040
Some animals

02:25.040 --> 02:27.160
have changed their behaviour

02:27.160 --> 02:30.600
to make the most
out of living amongst us.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.960
These long-tailed macaques
live in Bali.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.440
They have developed
new interests

02:52.440 --> 02:55.440
brought by human visitors.

03:04.240 --> 03:08.200
Every morning,
the troop heads for a building

03:08.200 --> 03:11.240
in the centre
of their territory.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.680
Uluwatu Temple.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.840
Tourists come here every day -
in crowds.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.440
So the temple grounds
are full of opportunities...

03:41.480 --> 03:43.600
...if you know where to look.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.520
There is a constant supply
of hats...

04:16.560 --> 04:18.120
...and sunglasses.

04:22.560 --> 04:26.400
And if you've mastered
the element of surprise...

04:27.960 --> 04:31.040
...it's easy to get them.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.120
But this harvest
is not for eating.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.960
It's for bargaining.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.760
Seems like a fair trade.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.440
But there are greater rewards
to be had

05:09.440 --> 05:12.480
for those who know
how to get them.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.960
And this old male
appears to be doing...

05:23.240 --> 05:24.760
...very well.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.960
He and the other elders
in this troop

05:33.960 --> 05:38.320
have both experience
and knowledge.

05:43.520 --> 05:48.240
They've been working the temple
for over ten years,

05:48.240 --> 05:50.880
and now concentrate
on the big stuff...

05:56.720 --> 06:01.240
...things that human beings
just can't do without.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.360
No-one wants to walk home
with just one shoe.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.360
And these old boys can't wait

06:21.360 --> 06:25.080
to get their hands
on the latest tech.

06:42.680 --> 06:46.920
They've worked out
that we simply can't survive

06:46.920 --> 06:49.160
without our phones...

06:52.040 --> 06:54.720
...or our wallets.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.200
The older males understand

07:17.200 --> 07:20.040
something the youngsters
have yet to learn...

07:22.720 --> 07:26.240
...the art of the deal.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.040
A banana?

07:33.080 --> 07:34.640
How dare you!

07:37.880 --> 07:39.480
A bar of chocolate?

07:39.480 --> 07:40.920
That's better.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.880
The real skill
is in the negotiations.

07:53.280 --> 07:58.120
The macaques are playing us
at our own game.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.600
They demand...

08:04.040 --> 08:05.920
...whatever they want.

08:17.240 --> 08:22.480
Humanity has spread
to every corner of the globe.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.920
We have become
a force of nature.

08:37.920 --> 08:42.160
We have altered
80% of the land's surface.

08:49.440 --> 08:53.840
Eight billion people
now live on this planet...

08:54.880 --> 08:57.520
...and we are changing
the world around us

08:57.520 --> 08:58.840
at such speed...

09:01.880 --> 09:06.800
...that, for animals,
the challenge is to keep up.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.760
New York City.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.720
Ants.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.040
This particular species
is thought to have arrived here

09:23.040 --> 09:25.520
with the first European settlers.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.000
They are now known as pavement ants

09:32.000 --> 09:36.960
because they live almost exclusively
in our towns and cities.

09:47.640 --> 09:52.400
And they're thriving
because of junk food.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.480
And here on Broadway Avenue,

09:56.480 --> 09:58.480
there's a lot of it.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.680
This is what every pavement ant desires.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.520
And to get it...

10:12.400 --> 10:15.960
...the ants use
the city's thousands of miles

10:15.960 --> 10:17.600
of underground tunnels.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.720
This scout is closing in
on its target.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.480
But the animals with which
they share the pavement

10:35.480 --> 10:38.480
are 40 million times
their weight...

10:42.040 --> 10:45.520
...so it's best
to stay in the cracks.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.880
Jackpot!

10:55.880 --> 10:57.880
A meat mountain.

10:58.920 --> 11:02.720
This is too big a job
for just one ant.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.280
This worker is female,

11:07.280 --> 11:10.160
as they are
in all ant colonies,

11:10.160 --> 11:15.120
and she leaves a trail of pheromones
to mark a path.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.720
She communicates
with every sister she meets

11:21.720 --> 11:24.960
as she returns to the nest,

11:24.960 --> 11:28.200
and news on the street
spreads fast.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.480
This ultra-processed meat

11:43.480 --> 11:46.120
is very different
from their original food.

11:47.960 --> 11:52.200
But their digestive system
is the key to their success.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.680
It's able to keep up
with the way

11:55.680 --> 11:58.800
humans constantly change
their diet.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.880
Nowadays, the vast majority
of what they eat

12:05.880 --> 12:08.040
comes from human food.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.360
On Broadway alone,

12:17.360 --> 12:20.120
pavement ants
eat the equivalent

12:20.120 --> 12:24.840
of a staggering 60,000 hot dogs
every year.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.880
The calories
in a single hot dog

12:30.880 --> 12:32.440
could fuel the growth

12:32.440 --> 12:35.160
of the entire ant colony
for a month...

12:36.160 --> 12:39.640
...if only they can get it
back to the nest.

12:53.280 --> 12:57.880
But this slow work
makes them vulnerable.

13:02.800 --> 13:07.000
They aren't the only ones
partial to fast food.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.680
It's a race
to get their prize home.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.520
There may be losses...

13:22.640 --> 13:26.440
...but the colony as a whole
will now thrive.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.240
In fact, pavement ants
are so successful here

13:34.240 --> 13:37.840
that they outnumber
human New Yorkers 1,000 to 1.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.880
But success in the human world
can be harder to achieve

13:47.880 --> 13:51.800
if your reputation precedes you.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.680
Here in India,

14:03.680 --> 14:07.920
this cobra is heading directly
for a village.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.720
It has detected
the scent of prey.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.920
Nearly two metres long,

14:19.920 --> 14:23.120
it has enough venom
in a single bite

14:23.120 --> 14:25.200
to kill ten people.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.200
Snake bites are responsible

14:42.200 --> 14:45.360
for nearly 60,000 deaths a year

14:45.360 --> 14:47.120
in India alone.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.960
They travel so silently

14:57.960 --> 15:01.480
that their presence
is often undetected.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.280
And when they are hunting...

15:16.560 --> 15:19.080
...there is no place
they won't go.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.400
A toad.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.280
Each tip of its forked tongue

16:21.280 --> 16:24.360
collects chemical signals
from the prey

16:24.360 --> 16:27.200
and helps to reveal
its position.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.320
But up close...

16:35.640 --> 16:37.920
...the snake relies on movement

16:37.920 --> 16:41.000
to precisely locate its prey.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.800
The toad must pick its moment
to escape.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.760
Every time
it touches the ground...

17:18.000 --> 17:21.320
...the toad leaves behind a scent.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.920
It can hide...

17:35.360 --> 17:38.640
...but the trail
will lead the snake to it.

18:14.960 --> 18:19.160
These cobras
don't just hunt here.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.040
They live here.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.680
They have found a home where
the Hindu villagers revere them

18:27.680 --> 18:31.000
and consider them
to be demigods.

18:33.800 --> 18:38.320
Remarkably, scientists believe
that this tolerance

18:38.320 --> 18:41.080
has led to a change
in the snakes' behaviour.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.560
They move more slowly

18:46.560 --> 18:49.360
and are less likely
to strike if disturbed.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.680
One of the most feared animals
on the planet

18:55.680 --> 18:59.400
has found a place
where they are accepted

18:59.400 --> 19:02.240
and can coexist
with human beings.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.360
But for many animals
living in the human world,

19:13.360 --> 19:17.160
it pays to keep a low profile.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.560
Here in Melbourne, Australia,

19:24.560 --> 19:28.080
one creature has perfected
the art of camouflage.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.840
A frogmouth chick.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.040
Its father helps to hide it
during the day.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.320
They are nocturnal birds,

19:53.320 --> 19:55.920
and as day turns to night,

19:55.920 --> 19:58.760
its parents come out
of the shadows

19:58.760 --> 20:02.440
to reap the rewards
of urban living.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.680
The city lights create

20:07.680 --> 20:10.400
excellent conditions
for hunting.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.600
Every night in the city

20:13.600 --> 20:16.640
is as bright
as when there is a full moon.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.560
So city frogmouths often...

20:29.600 --> 20:31.960
...have their mouths full.

20:36.360 --> 20:41.640
He's growing fast, and today
he just won't sit still.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.240
And now he has revealed
his presence.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.720
The first rule
of frogmouth behaviour is

20:53.720 --> 20:56.400
don't move in the day.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.040
But this is the one time
in a frogmouth's life

21:00.040 --> 21:04.480
when the urge to fly
simply cannot be suppressed.

21:12.360 --> 21:17.960
But he's not ready
to leave home just yet.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.560
Come night-time...

21:25.720 --> 21:27.760
...he's hungry again.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.040
He is wide awake...

21:40.840 --> 21:44.600
...and wants to take off
where he left off.

21:49.560 --> 21:53.240
But he's getting
unwanted attention,

21:53.240 --> 21:58.280
and this time his parent
is not nearby to protect him.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.440
Humans bring pets,

22:04.440 --> 22:09.960
and cats in Australia
kill a million birds a day.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.320
His first proper flight.

23:00.840 --> 23:04.320
But unless he can find
a safe place to roost,

23:04.320 --> 23:06.440
he is still in peril.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.120
Made it.

23:19.760 --> 23:23.880
But if he is to survive
in the city, like the adults,

23:23.880 --> 23:27.160
he'll have to learn
how to blend in.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.240
Some animals are so bold

23:44.240 --> 23:46.960
that they don't even
try to hide.

23:49.640 --> 23:55.160
To see a large predator in the
built-up world is a rare sight.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.800
And here in Lake Tahoe,
in North America,

24:01.800 --> 24:06.040
these black bears
are particularly big...

24:08.640 --> 24:12.040
...and they're heading
right to the centre of town.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.160
Winter is approaching,

24:16.160 --> 24:19.160
and these bears need to put on
as much weight as possible

24:19.160 --> 24:21.200
before the snow arrives.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.440
This is a great place to gorge.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.040
It's now bear country.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.640
Why struggle for a meal...

24:43.920 --> 24:46.000
...when you can cross the street...

24:47.280 --> 24:49.040
...for a takeaway?

24:55.920 --> 24:58.280
There's so much food here

24:58.280 --> 25:01.480
that some of the bears
are 50% heavier

25:01.480 --> 25:03.320
than their country cousins.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.120
But why stop here?

25:11.720 --> 25:15.400
Some bears
just want to dine in.

25:22.680 --> 25:28.080
A lucky few are able to get
an easy meal from the human world.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.280
But when WE venture to the natural
world in search of food...

25:35.920 --> 25:38.880
...the harvest
is on a different scale.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.120
In just four decades,

25:42.120 --> 25:46.680
fishing reduced
fish populations by half...

25:48.440 --> 25:51.960
...and created great problems
for the ocean predators

25:51.960 --> 25:54.640
that once had such food
to themselves.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.760
Off the coast
of Vancouver Island,

26:04.760 --> 26:07.800
humpback whales inhabit waters

26:07.800 --> 26:10.760
where herring
have been overfished.

26:15.640 --> 26:20.680
Humpbacks, however, are
renowned for their ingenuity.

26:22.640 --> 26:27.040
12 years ago, an adult male
called Conger

26:27.040 --> 26:30.600
adopted a totally new way
of feeding.

26:31.880 --> 26:35.080
When the density of fish
in the water is low,

26:35.080 --> 26:37.640
and birds are diving
to catch them...

26:39.760 --> 26:41.760
...the humpback opens its mouth

26:41.760 --> 26:45.840
and creates a space that
the fish mistake for shelter.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.920
The fish swim in...

26:57.880 --> 27:00.960
...and the trap is closed.

27:07.160 --> 27:11.560
Conger was the first humpback
whale to be seen doing this.

27:14.720 --> 27:19.480
Now 30 whales in the area
use this same technique.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.600
The population of humpbacks
here is growing,

27:28.600 --> 27:31.160
and you might think
that this would

27:31.160 --> 27:33.800
reduce fish stocks even more,

27:33.800 --> 27:36.680
but something surprising
is thought to be happening.

27:38.320 --> 27:42.520
These tiny phytoplankton
are the basis of the food chain

27:42.520 --> 27:46.120
and need a vital ingredient to grow.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.560
Iron.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.520
Whale faeces are rich in iron...

28:01.840 --> 28:06.520
...and great whales produce it
in enormous quantities...

28:07.960 --> 28:13.520
...so the phytoplankton flourishes,
and herring feed on it.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.680
Whale faeces, in fact,

28:18.680 --> 28:22.320
are helping to restore
the whole ecosystem.

28:24.480 --> 28:28.160
The herring attract seabirds,

28:28.160 --> 28:31.720
diving birds attack them
from beneath,

28:31.720 --> 28:35.520
and gulls and shearwaters
dive on them from above.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.400
Even bald eagles
benefit from this rich feast.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.600
Astonishingly, even though
Conger and all the other whales

29:23.600 --> 29:26.240
are feasting on fish,

29:26.240 --> 29:30.960
their role in fertilising
the ocean is so influential

29:30.960 --> 29:35.120
that herring numbers here are
actually predicted to increase.

29:42.240 --> 29:46.600
And the role they play in
rejuvenating the environment...

29:52.360 --> 29:56.560
...is having an even greater
impact on the human world.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.400
The flourishing plankton
also collects carbon

30:08.400 --> 30:10.800
from the atmosphere,
just as trees do...

30:13.280 --> 30:17.040
...so much so
that each great whale

30:17.040 --> 30:22.240
has the same impact
as a forest of 30,000 trees.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.800
Our great whales
were once hunted...

30:34.800 --> 30:38.040
...and if they return
to their pre-whaling numbers,

30:38.040 --> 30:41.760
it's estimated that this
would be equivalent to planting

30:41.760 --> 30:45.280
over 30 billion trees.

30:59.120 --> 31:03.720
Whales are now being recognised
as benefiting humanity.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.920
But for most large animals,

31:10.920 --> 31:15.200
competition with humans
brings conflict.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.600
This six-tonne African
bull elephant is in his prime.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.800
To stand the best chance
of winning fights for females,

31:28.800 --> 31:30.720
he needs to be big.

31:32.640 --> 31:37.040
He can smell
highly nutritious food is near.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.840
But crossing the boundary
to reach it

31:48.840 --> 31:51.280
is a dangerous journey.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.680
He must wait
for the cover of darkness.

32:10.280 --> 32:16.080
These Kenyan farmers are
preparing for the night ahead.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.440
They have had to guard
their crops every night

32:21.440 --> 32:23.040
for the last two months.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.520
With only two days
until harvest,

32:29.520 --> 32:32.720
this is a critical time.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.480
In a single night,

32:42.480 --> 32:45.800
a bull elephant
can destroy the entire crops

32:45.800 --> 32:47.680
produced by ten farmers.

33:04.360 --> 33:07.080
But he's taking a huge risk.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.200
He's twice the height
of a man...

33:48.640 --> 33:50.680
...and he won't back down easily.

33:54.880 --> 33:59.840
This human-wildlife conflict
happens night after night.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.280
And each year,
it takes the lives

34:05.280 --> 34:10.240
of up to 200 elephants
and 20 people in Kenya alone.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.840
This standoff
is potentially lethal.

34:19.640 --> 34:22.040
The farmers
have had to call for help

34:22.040 --> 34:25.160
from a team
of highly experienced rangers.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.600
Although they're armed,

34:43.600 --> 34:47.040
their task is to drive
the elephant out of the field

34:47.040 --> 34:48.600
without harming it.

34:51.720 --> 34:54.120
But the bull is determined...

34:56.040 --> 34:57.840
...to hold ground.

35:02.760 --> 35:06.000
The rangers
will have to get closer...

35:08.040 --> 35:09.480
...on foot.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.200
The rangers have to resort...

35:29.200 --> 35:32.560
...to firecrackers.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.640
The bull is driven
from this field...

35:54.960 --> 35:57.720
...and retreats deep into the bush.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.040
Fortunately for this bull,

36:09.040 --> 36:12.520
the battle
has been resolved peacefully.

36:12.520 --> 36:16.600
And efforts like these are seeing
fewer elephants killed,

36:16.600 --> 36:20.960
and their population in Kenya
is starting to rise again.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.760
But conflict with wildlife

36:24.760 --> 36:27.560
is now occurring
on a far greater scale

36:27.560 --> 36:28.760
as a consequence

36:28.760 --> 36:31.640
of the way we are changing
the world's climate.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.000
Some arid regions

36:37.000 --> 36:40.720
are now experiencing
unusually high rainfall.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.920
And that is good
for growing crops

36:47.920 --> 36:50.040
here in northeastern Africa.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.400
But it's also
the perfect conditions

36:55.400 --> 36:58.040
for one particular insect.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.360
Desert locusts.

37:18.920 --> 37:22.320
They're normally solitary creatures,

37:22.320 --> 37:25.200
but emerging from the sand
in great numbers

37:25.200 --> 37:27.960
triggers a dramatic physical change.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.720
They turn a vivid yellow

37:37.720 --> 37:39.800
and become highly social.

37:41.400 --> 37:45.600
Together,
they are an unstoppable army.

37:46.880 --> 37:51.560
On foot,
they can cover a mile a day.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.480
But they can only go so far
in this way.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.440
They need to find height.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.920
Up here, they begin
their final transformation.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.080
Normally,
it takes an individual insect

38:34.080 --> 38:37.360
at least a month
to become a winged adult...

38:38.880 --> 38:42.720
...but in their social form,
their development speeds up.

38:58.480 --> 39:02.760
Now all they need
is for their wings to harden.

39:14.240 --> 39:18.720
Once airborne, they can travel
60 miles in a day.

39:39.560 --> 39:44.040
Swarms merge
and they become a plague.

39:47.720 --> 39:52.280
This one contains
billions of individuals,

39:52.280 --> 39:54.480
and eats as much in a day

39:54.480 --> 39:58.080
as the entire population
of Germany.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.200
Today in northeastern Africa,

40:28.200 --> 40:31.640
as a consequence
of climate change...

40:32.640 --> 40:35.200
...devastating surges of locusts

40:35.200 --> 40:37.520
are becoming more frequent.

40:48.120 --> 40:52.360
Two worlds are colliding.

41:00.520 --> 41:05.560
Unintentionally, humanity has
created exactly the conditions

41:05.560 --> 41:10.040
that cause this species
to explode in numbers.

41:35.440 --> 41:38.200
But another group of animals
has seen

41:38.200 --> 41:40.680
an even more dramatic rise

41:40.680 --> 41:43.520
as a consequence of OUR actions.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.640
We have increased the numbers
of a few species

41:50.640 --> 41:52.680
almost astronomically.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.880
By weight,

41:55.880 --> 41:59.920
70% of the world's birds
are now chickens

41:59.920 --> 42:02.560
or other domesticated fowl.

42:13.200 --> 42:18.120
We rear 70 billion farm animals
each year...

42:19.680 --> 42:22.480
...and every one of them
needs feeding.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.760
Producing the food

42:25.760 --> 42:29.000
for such numbers
of domesticated animals

42:29.000 --> 42:32.760
is having a profound impact
on the natural world.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.400
The Amazon rainforest -

42:43.400 --> 42:46.240
twice the size of India.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.080
It's so rich,

42:50.080 --> 42:54.760
it contains one in every ten
species on the planet.

42:55.880 --> 43:00.600
And it's home to this sloth
and her ten-month-old baby.

43:07.760 --> 43:11.440
He was born into an environment

43:11.440 --> 43:14.560
virtually untouched by humanity.

43:23.200 --> 43:28.640
But now human beings
are claiming even this space.

43:56.280 --> 44:00.400
Year after year, we clear
over two million hectares

44:00.400 --> 44:02.240
of the Amazon forest -

44:02.240 --> 44:05.720
an area the size of Wales.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.920
And we use nearly all of it

44:14.920 --> 44:17.480
to make more space
for cattle...

44:18.680 --> 44:22.600
...and to grow soya
to feed our livestock.

44:27.280 --> 44:31.440
Today, habitat destruction
is the biggest problem

44:31.440 --> 44:35.040
we have created for wildlife
around the world.

44:41.120 --> 44:44.480
This porcupine
has survived the fire...

44:47.640 --> 44:49.680
...and is being rescued.

44:58.440 --> 45:03.120
It's being relocated
to pristine forests.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.400
This will be its new home.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.520
Only a fortunate few animals

45:21.520 --> 45:25.000
are being given
such a second chance.

45:47.600 --> 45:51.800
A healthy natural world is
not only vital for wildlife...

45:53.000 --> 45:56.880
...but for our own very existence.

46:01.800 --> 46:06.600
Somehow we must find ways
to redress the balance.

46:13.920 --> 46:18.440
Currently, the vast majority
of agricultural land,

46:18.440 --> 46:20.680
more than 75%,

46:20.680 --> 46:23.360
is used to raise livestock,

46:23.360 --> 46:25.920
and this is very inefficient.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.760
There are solutions.

46:33.560 --> 46:36.400
One is considering what we eat.

46:45.920 --> 46:49.200
If we shift away
from eating meat and dairy

46:49.200 --> 46:52.400
and move towards
a plant-based diet,

46:52.400 --> 46:57.160
then the sun's energy goes directly
into growing our food.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.960
And because
that's so much more efficient,

47:06.960 --> 47:10.520
we could still produce
enough to feed us,

47:10.520 --> 47:14.360
but do so
using a quarter of the land.

47:18.320 --> 47:22.880
This could free up an area
the size of the United States,

47:22.880 --> 47:28.520
China, the European Union
and Australia combined...

47:30.880 --> 47:35.880
...space that could then
be given back to nature.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.960
And human innovations
may be able

47:43.960 --> 47:46.680
to do even more for wildlife.

47:49.680 --> 47:54.200
High-tech farms
now grow plants vertically,

47:54.200 --> 47:59.520
yielding up to 350 times
the food grown in the same area.

48:03.680 --> 48:07.080
This is one of many solutions
we already have,

48:07.080 --> 48:10.360
and others
are surely on the horizon.

48:22.920 --> 48:26.200
To find ways
to protect all life on Earth

48:26.200 --> 48:31.320
means reimagining how we live
on this planet in the future.

48:31.320 --> 48:33.160
Human ingenuity,

48:33.160 --> 48:36.600
our extraordinary ability
to find solutions,

48:36.600 --> 48:39.960
gives me hope that we can.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.280
It will be the major challenge

48:42.280 --> 48:45.240
for this generation
and the next.

49:12.080 --> 49:13.800
To film the impact

49:13.800 --> 49:15.920
that fires are having
on the Amazon,

49:15.920 --> 49:17.280
the Planet Earth III team

49:17.280 --> 49:20.960
joined a local
volunteer fire brigade.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.240
The fire brigade
are responding to a patch

49:25.240 --> 49:27.760
of primary rainforest
that is burning.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.480
It's been burning
for two days now.

49:29.480 --> 49:32.280
It's difficult to know
what we're going to see.

49:34.880 --> 49:37.880
The fires
are mainly lit illegally...

49:39.440 --> 49:41.800
...to clear space for cattle.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.640
Battling fires
is dangerous work.

50:01.640 --> 50:05.760
But the firefighters
face them every day.

50:07.240 --> 50:09.280
For the wildlife film crew,

50:09.280 --> 50:12.240
this is a totally new experience.

50:13.240 --> 50:17.160
And these fires
can be unpredictable.

50:17.160 --> 50:19.520
Neil, don't spend long
in there.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.360
Oh!

50:52.600 --> 50:55.400
With the ground team retreating,

50:55.400 --> 50:59.480
the safest way to carry on
filming is with the drone.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.360
Have we lost the drone?
I think Abi has seen it.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.560
Abi is on her way.

51:30.560 --> 51:33.360
Can you confirm you're on
your way to the drone, Abi?

51:52.040 --> 51:55.400
The drone is damaged
beyond repair.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.360
Don't worry about it.
I mean it.

51:58.360 --> 52:01.000
Don't worry about it.
It's absolutely fine.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.600
It's not OK. It is. It's OK.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.320
It's equipment.
We've got a spare.

52:04.320 --> 52:06.960
The main thing is,
we're all safe. No-one's hurt.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.560
The team regroup...

52:13.520 --> 52:15.960
...and decide to move away
from the heart of the fire

52:15.960 --> 52:18.080
to its fringes

52:18.080 --> 52:21.240
to look for animals
caught up in the flames.

52:23.400 --> 52:26.640
There's been reports
of a monkey in the trees, so...

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Ah!

52:31.280 --> 52:33.520
The problem is, there's fires
all the way along here,

52:33.520 --> 52:35.920
as well as all along here, so...

52:35.920 --> 52:38.080
It's hard to know what all
this wildlife is going to do

52:38.080 --> 52:40.400
when their home
is burnt up like this.

52:42.320 --> 52:46.360
I don't know what it's like
for these rainforest animals

52:46.360 --> 52:47.840
to be experiencing a fire.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.760
It's horrific for me, so...

52:50.840 --> 52:53.480
...I don't know
what it is for them.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.080
The fires burn into the night.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.120
The following day,

53:14.120 --> 53:17.040
the crew accompany
the firefighters

53:17.040 --> 53:20.840
in the search for animals
in the aftermath.

53:22.240 --> 53:25.000
Oh, my God, there are flames
all inside of it.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.680
Little termite...

53:28.200 --> 53:30.280
Oh, my God!

53:32.000 --> 53:36.040
Remarkably,
some animals have survived.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.240
Clearing land for farming

54:35.240 --> 54:37.720
is not a problem
unique to the Amazon.

54:39.800 --> 54:43.640
Agriculture now takes up
half of the habitable land

54:43.640 --> 54:45.520
on the planet.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.320
To produce food with less impact
on the natural world

54:50.320 --> 54:53.200
requires new approaches.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.360
And that led the wildlife
film crew to a farm

54:58.360 --> 55:00.520
in a warehouse.

55:05.040 --> 55:06.880
We're in the middle of the city!

55:06.880 --> 55:09.080
I can't believe so much food

55:09.080 --> 55:11.600
being grown
in such a small space!

55:14.400 --> 55:18.880
Here in Los Angeles,
6,000 miles from the Amazon,

55:18.880 --> 55:22.520
this farm is part of
a burgeoning food revolution.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.320
This is the most productive
farm in the world,

55:27.320 --> 55:30.080
and it's our goal to reduce the
amount of land and resources

55:30.080 --> 55:32.480
necessary to grow
down to the bare minimum.

55:32.480 --> 55:34.920
It took a while
to understand that, for nature,

55:34.920 --> 55:36.960
agricultural use of land

55:36.960 --> 55:40.640
was the primary, like, destructive
behaviour of humanity.

55:40.640 --> 55:43.840
As we expand
this means of growing,

55:43.840 --> 55:47.000
I'm very hopeful that
this approach can ultimately

55:47.000 --> 55:49.240
give a lot of land back
to nature

55:49.240 --> 55:52.040
and allow that biodiversity
to re-establish and flourish.

55:54.360 --> 55:57.840
Not only does this farm
use less space...

55:59.040 --> 56:03.240
...but it also uses 90% less water,
