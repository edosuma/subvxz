<i>[Bandon] Previously on The Fosters:</i>

00:02.009 --> 00:02.995
- Hey.
- Well, look who's here?

00:03.080 --> 00:04.914
Ana and I work in the program together.

00:04.965 --> 00:06.899
I got 60 days, clean.

00:06.934 --> 00:08.951
- I don't...
- Let's just go somewhere and talk, OK?

00:08.986 --> 00:11.003
So she can lie to me again? No.

00:11.038 --> 00:14.941
<i>[Stef] We got a letter from Ana. She
wants to see the twins to make amends.</i>

00:15.055 --> 00:17.823
Did she really send you a letter,
asking if she could see us?

00:17.858 --> 00:20.726
- Yes, she did.
- Well, I want to. See her.

00:20.761 --> 00:22.728
My dad won't let me sleep over at your
house because he thinks you're gay.

00:22.730 --> 00:24.196
I know you're not. I
have to do what he says.

00:24.248 --> 00:27.550
You made it seem like you just found
out so Jesus would miss his team dinner.

00:27.601 --> 00:29.602
That's not true. I was upset...

00:29.636 --> 00:30.953
Yeah, that Emma was going to be there.

00:30.988 --> 00:33.506
I didn't get the principal job.

00:33.508 --> 00:37.810
The woman who got it isn't even
really an educator. She's corporate.

00:37.844 --> 00:41.480
- What's going on with you? Is it Wyatt?
- We're kind of taking a break.

00:41.515 --> 00:43.649
You having trouble being with
Wyatt? You've gotta get some help.

00:43.651 --> 00:47.243
We've gotta convince the neighbors that
having us here is actually a good thing.

00:47.244 --> 00:50.273
Hence, Community Day.
Everyone out! Out of the house!

[knocks]

01:11.762 --> 01:15.748
So would you like a drink or
anything? I can... water or iced tea.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.800
I can make you an Arnold Palmer.

01:17.834 --> 01:19.552
No, thanks.

01:19.603 --> 01:22.021
I have to get to work.
I was just dropped by

01:22.039 --> 01:25.574
to see how it's going, with Girls United.

01:25.626 --> 01:27.643
Well, it's not really going anywhere.

01:27.678 --> 01:31.564
I mean, no one wants
to rent to a group home.

01:32.633 --> 01:34.383
Couldn't you buy a house?

01:34.418 --> 01:37.486
[chuckles] Yeah, if I won the lottery.

01:37.521 --> 01:39.605
Hey, how'd you get my address?

01:39.640 --> 01:43.476
Oh, um, you can pretty much find out
where anyone lives on the Internet.

01:43.510 --> 01:49.298
Well, this is it. What do you think?

01:49.333 --> 01:51.317
I think I'd give you an unacceptable.

01:51.351 --> 01:53.386
[chuckles]

01:55.155 --> 01:58.391
So, um, what about the county?

01:58.425 --> 02:00.893
Can't they help you find you a house?

02:00.944 --> 02:03.963
Right now they're threatening
to revoke my license.

02:03.997 --> 02:06.032
Why?

02:06.066 --> 02:09.835
Because one of my girls nearly
burned a house while we were in it.

02:09.870 --> 02:11.037
That wasn't your fault.

02:11.121 --> 02:13.923
No, but it's my responsibility.

02:13.974 --> 02:16.726
There was underground stuff going on
that we should have told you about.

02:16.777 --> 02:19.528
Well, you know what? Maybe
it's all for the best.

02:20.764 --> 02:22.848
Why do you say that?

02:22.850 --> 02:24.617
I don't know.

02:27.554 --> 02:29.438
I'm tired, Callie.

02:32.376 --> 02:35.261
- She can't just give up.
- You blame her?

02:35.295 --> 02:37.663
County's always breakin' her balls
over things like loose toilet seats

02:37.698 --> 02:40.533
when other group homes are
barely feedin' the kids.

02:40.567 --> 02:44.587
And you know most the girls, they
all about attitude, not gratitude.

02:44.708 --> 02:46.642
What if we, like, organize a fund-raiser?

02:46.676 --> 02:50.146
Like a bake sale? You
know how much a house cost?

02:50.197 --> 02:52.248
Too bad one of us doesn't
know somebody rich.

02:52.282 --> 02:54.250
No. I'm not asking Robert for money.

02:54.252 --> 03:00.122
OK. You know, if it wasn't for Sophia, I'm
not even sure we'd have a relationship at all.

03:00.157 --> 03:01.323
- Hmm.
- What?

03:01.374 --> 03:02.992
Speak of the devil.

03:07.130 --> 03:09.048
[man] Excuse me.

03:09.082 --> 03:12.134
- So, I probably should have called.
- It's OK.

03:12.169 --> 03:16.005
No, I promised I wouldn't show
up, without your mom's knowing.

03:16.056 --> 03:18.090
But I wanted you to
hear this from me, first.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.051
She's been here a lot on school nights.

04:02.053 --> 04:04.970
- We're studying.
- Yeah, right.

04:05.021 --> 04:07.189
- Brandon gets to rehearse on school nights.
- Hey, leave me outta this.

04:07.224 --> 04:11.060
Hayley's going through a hard time,
her parents are getting divorced.

04:11.111 --> 04:13.946
- Boy, has she milked that one.
- I thought she was your friend.

04:13.980 --> 04:17.065
She is. It's just when it comes to
guys she can be like super needy.

04:17.117 --> 04:19.118
- Oh, I'll tell her you said so.
- You better not.

04:19.152 --> 04:22.071
- Connor can be kinda needy.
- It's not just girls.

04:22.072 --> 04:24.957
- Sorry.
- Hey, you got slammed, huh?

04:24.991 --> 04:28.410
Like five minutes before my shift was
supposed to end. Thought we gave away food.

04:28.412 --> 04:30.246
- Let me make your plate.
- No, it's OK.

04:30.248 --> 04:35.084
- Why can't I get a job?
- You can when you're 16.

04:35.135 --> 04:39.221
All right, so I have some news, everyone.
The new principal starts tomorrow.

04:39.256 --> 04:40.973
- Have you met her?
- Not yet.

04:41.007 --> 04:42.975
- It should have been you.
- No sour grapes.

04:43.009 --> 04:46.061
- I hope she's nice.
- She can't be worse than Snatchez.

04:46.096 --> 04:48.230
What did you call her?

04:48.265 --> 04:49.265
Uh, I have some news, too.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.100
[sighs] Good, I hope.

04:51.151 --> 04:54.019
Robert Quinn has offered

04:54.070 --> 04:57.106
to have a fund-raiser at
his house for Girls United.

04:57.108 --> 04:58.274
Wow, that's generous.

04:58.325 --> 05:00.025
So, you asked him for help?

05:00.076 --> 05:02.194
Well, I asked for Rita.

05:02.245 --> 05:04.163
That was a nice thing to do.

05:04.197 --> 05:07.116
- Yeah, so it's this Saturday.
- Wow, that's fast.

05:07.118 --> 05:08.951
Yeah, Robert thinks they
can pull it together.

05:09.002 --> 05:10.953
Can we help?

05:10.955 --> 05:13.038
You know, maybe... do you
think the band would play?

05:13.089 --> 05:14.123
Really?

05:14.125 --> 05:15.257
You guys are great.

05:15.292 --> 05:17.092
Yeah. I have to ask everyone.

05:17.127 --> 05:18.210
What can we do?

05:18.261 --> 05:19.295
Just come.

05:19.346 --> 05:21.213
- Can I invite Hayley?
- No.

05:21.264 --> 05:23.215
It's mostly just gonna be their friends.

05:23.266 --> 05:24.300
We'll, all be there.

05:26.136 --> 05:28.137
And I have some other news, too.

05:31.391 --> 05:35.144
Robert signed the abandonment
papers. So I can get adopted.

05:35.195 --> 05:38.397
[all cheering]

05:38.448 --> 05:40.950
Talk about burying the lead!

05:40.984 --> 05:42.318
- That's great.
- Oh, my goodness.

05:42.369 --> 05:45.321
- Oh, our baby!
- That's good news.

So, you know, it's a work in progress.

06:09.145 --> 06:11.263
But it's got that 80's
sound you were talking about.

06:11.314 --> 06:13.232
- I like it.
- It's sweet.

06:13.266 --> 06:14.900
Sweet?

06:14.934 --> 06:17.186
You know me, I'm not really
a one true love kinda girl.

06:18.989 --> 06:23.359
It's a little... soft, for me.

06:25.996 --> 06:27.096
I'll re-write it then.

06:27.130 --> 06:28.998
I like the melody.

06:29.032 --> 06:33.969
Yeah, no, the lyrics, so
I'll "edge" it up a bit.

06:34.004 --> 06:37.206
We should work on the set for this weekend.

06:37.257 --> 06:39.008
Sorry, I gotta bounce.

06:40.010 --> 06:41.377
But we need to rehearse more.

06:41.379 --> 06:43.212
Well, I can't cancel, I have a date.

06:46.116 --> 06:47.933
I'm free the rest of the week.

06:49.052 --> 06:51.353
Yeah, I'm good. We'll have Jasper, too.

06:51.388 --> 06:53.222
All right.

06:53.224 --> 06:54.223
Later.

06:57.961 --> 06:59.061
What?

06:59.095 --> 07:00.195
Dude.

07:02.132 --> 07:05.768
Lou has a history, with boys in the band.

07:05.819 --> 07:07.169
She blows through them like the wind.

07:07.203 --> 07:09.038
But there's nothing going on.

07:09.132 --> 07:11.066
Yet.

07:11.101 --> 07:14.837
Look, the other guys were no loss

07:14.871 --> 07:18.874
but we've got great chemistry.
I don't want any drama.

07:18.908 --> 07:21.593
Me either. Don't worry.

07:24.764 --> 07:26.482
So, like, how many guys?

07:32.689 --> 07:36.291
So, have you guys talked about Ana?

07:38.595 --> 07:40.496
If you're sure you want to
see her, we'll arrange it.

07:40.530 --> 07:42.364
She's just gonna cry and
say how hard she's tried

07:42.366 --> 07:44.333
but nothing ever works
because everyone's against her.

07:44.367 --> 07:45.501
You don't know what she's gonna say.

07:45.535 --> 07:48.103
I know she's the reason that Mom got shot.

07:48.105 --> 07:50.305
And I know she knew it when she
showed up at the women's shelter

07:50.340 --> 07:51.995
and acted like she
needed my help when really

07:51.996 --> 07:52.996
she just wanted more money for drugs.

07:53.259 --> 07:55.310
- OK, well, you don't have to see her.
- Don't worry, I'm not.

07:55.312 --> 07:58.931
I'm done. Can I go do my homework?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.184
Yeah, OK, go ahead.

08:02.218 --> 08:03.869
You didn't take out the garbage!

08:03.903 --> 08:05.187
Honey, I know, just...

08:05.221 --> 08:07.923
[sighs] Fine. I'll do it.

08:19.936 --> 08:21.787
It's hard not to resent Ana.

08:21.838 --> 08:25.541
She got to have her babies and
she didn't take care of them.

08:26.709 --> 08:28.577
It's not fair.

08:31.648 --> 08:33.381
I know.

08:38.914 --> 08:41.023
<i>I'm totally unqualified for this job.</i>

08:41.318 --> 08:42.434
I know that's what you're thinking.

08:42.469 --> 08:46.622
- No, I wasn't...
- That's what I'd be thinking.

08:46.657 --> 08:49.592
And I'd resent the fact that they
hired someone with a business background

08:49.626 --> 08:52.562
instead of an experienced
educator, like yourself.

08:52.564 --> 08:54.530
Well, I'm sure they had their reasons.

08:54.565 --> 08:57.417
They think you can run
a school like a business.

08:57.468 --> 09:00.303
I think they're wrong. I can
make Anchor Beach solvent.

09:00.337 --> 09:04.140
But I can't make it a
good school, without you.

09:04.174 --> 09:06.976
I'm giving you complete
authority over curriculum.

09:07.027 --> 09:10.947
We'll share administrative tasks and I'll
focus primarily on budget and finance.

09:10.981 --> 09:15.735
I would like to find the funds to reinstate
the music and arts and school club programs.

09:15.786 --> 09:18.955
And athletics. We don't want to lose
students because we don't offer team sports.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.006
Agreed.

09:20.057 --> 09:22.942
Good. We're on the same page.

09:22.993 --> 09:27.547
Oh, hi, Jude, come on in. This
is our new principal, Ms. Porter.

09:27.598 --> 09:28.664
This is my son, Jude.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.683
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:30.734 --> 09:34.370
And you can call me Monte.

09:34.372 --> 09:36.606
- Well, I'm gonna go get settled in.
- Great.

09:38.392 --> 09:40.409
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

09:40.444 --> 09:43.346
I need to talk to you about Connor.

09:47.284 --> 09:51.154
So it's gonna be a casual garden party.

09:51.188 --> 09:53.356
We've invited mostly friends.

09:53.390 --> 09:56.159
It's short notice, but
we expect a nice turn out.

09:56.161 --> 09:58.161
Well, if there's anything I
can do, please let me know.

09:58.163 --> 09:59.996
I think it would nice if you spoke.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.013
OK.

10:01.064 --> 10:05.001
And Callie, we thought
you could introduce her?

10:05.035 --> 10:06.886
Sure. [Clears throat]

10:06.937 --> 10:08.047
Maybe you could bring some of the girls,

10:08.048 --> 10:10.627
so they could share their
stories with the guests?

10:10.630 --> 10:12.041
Hmm. You know, it would be difficult

10:12.109 --> 10:15.077
to get the girls in juvenile
detention sprung for the day.

10:15.112 --> 10:19.715
But actually, Cole and
Kiara are in group homes,

10:19.766 --> 10:21.584
so that shouldn't be a problem.

10:21.618 --> 10:22.935
- And Daphne.
- Oh yeah, Daphne as well.

10:22.986 --> 10:26.589
Uh, there's also something
else need to discuss.

10:26.623 --> 10:30.476
When our friends ask us what our
connection is with Girls United,

10:30.511 --> 10:34.580
and with you, Callie, what should we say?

10:36.366 --> 10:38.601
We think it should be up
to you. What we tell people.

10:38.635 --> 10:42.338
[Robert] And whatever
you decide is OK with us.

10:42.372 --> 10:46.526
Um... I think, if you could just tell
people we're friends or something.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.980
I can't tell people you're my sister?

10:51.014 --> 10:54.150
[Jill] Honey, Callie's going to be
surrounded by a lot of strangers...

10:54.152 --> 10:56.020
What about when they say
how much we look alike?

10:56.021 --> 10:58.090
Everybody always says something.

10:58.098 --> 11:02.074
We smile and thank them for the compliment.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.026
And we respect Callie's privacy.

11:09.833 --> 11:12.935
So, should I come by early
Saturday morning to help set up?

11:13.003 --> 11:14.820
Sure.

11:14.871 --> 11:16.706
Why don't you sleep over, Friday night?

11:16.757 --> 11:20.643
Then you'll be here and
we can get ready together.

11:22.746 --> 11:24.463
You're welcome, of course.

11:25.616 --> 11:27.583
Yeah, sure. That would be fun.

11:29.286 --> 11:32.471
You think I hit my son in the face?

11:32.506 --> 11:35.408
- Is that what you told them?
- No.

11:35.442 --> 11:39.128
I was trying to give him a spanking and
he ran away from me, into a door jam.

11:39.130 --> 11:42.031
- That's what I said.
- OK, so why am I here?

11:42.065 --> 11:45.051
Connor, would you mind stepping
out so we can talk to your dad?

11:51.875 --> 11:54.844
Mr. Stevens, do you think it's appropriate
to spank a thirteen year old boy?

11:54.846 --> 11:56.722
I think it's none of your damn business.

11:56.723 --> 11:58.573
And quite frankly, this is all your fault.

11:58.577 --> 12:00.332
- My fault?
- Yeah, you were the chaperone

12:00.333 --> 12:01.733
on the seventh grade camping trip,

12:01.741 --> 12:05.416
and allowed our sons to spend the night
in a tent together without my permission.

12:05.451 --> 12:08.052
Why is that a problem?

12:08.087 --> 12:09.186
Because her son is gay.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.672
- Which I have no problem with...
- Clearly you do...

12:11.708 --> 12:15.009
Would you allow a boy and a girl
to share a tent? No. You wouldn't.

12:15.044 --> 12:16.344
My son has not defined
his sexuality in any way.

12:16.346 --> 12:18.813
The point is, Connor knows the rules.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.916
- Whose rules?
- Mine, my rules, for my son.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.952
And he violated them,
OK? And I punished him.

12:23.986 --> 12:25.687
Do you know the definition of bullying?

12:25.738 --> 12:27.205
Connor doesn't bully your son.

12:27.239 --> 12:29.958
Making threats, spreading rumors,
attacking someone physically or verbally

12:29.975 --> 12:33.027
or excluding someone
from a group on purpose.

12:33.062 --> 12:34.829
Connor stands up for Jude.

12:34.831 --> 12:38.433
I'm not talking about Connor. I'm
talking about you. You are the bully.

12:41.670 --> 12:44.505
I told him his dad would be
angry if we shared a tent.

12:44.557 --> 12:48.576
I'm partly to blame. I... I knew he
didn't want Connor spending the night here,

12:48.627 --> 12:50.511
but I guess...

12:50.546 --> 12:54.182
I just think he's wrong and ridiculous.

12:54.216 --> 12:56.317
Maybe we shouldn't be friends.

12:56.352 --> 12:58.286
No, that is not the answer.

13:00.389 --> 13:03.925
So, do you think it's true,
that he didn't hit Connor?

13:05.060 --> 13:07.095
I don't think he hit him in the face.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.833
Look, I don't want you to worry.

13:11.867 --> 13:12.934
OK?

13:12.968 --> 13:15.737
I'm dealing with this.

13:15.771 --> 13:17.839
OK, go up and do your homework.

13:25.814 --> 13:27.665
- Maybe they shouldn't be friends.
- What?

13:27.716 --> 13:29.951
Why would you say that?

13:29.985 --> 13:33.821
There are other kids in his grade who
have parents who are progressive and kind.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.541
So the bully wins and Connor suffers.

13:36.575 --> 13:37.875
He's already suffering.

13:37.927 --> 13:41.796
And maybe trying to educate his
dad is just making things worse.

13:41.830 --> 13:45.450
Well, sometimes it's my job to educate
the parents as well as the kids.

13:45.484 --> 13:47.502
And he's practically the
only friend that Jude has.

13:47.504 --> 13:50.305
Yeah, which isn't great.
Jude needs more friends.

13:50.339 --> 13:54.208
When have you ever
backed down from a fight?

13:54.243 --> 13:57.378
Let's say this was another kid at
school. What would you tell his parents?

13:57.413 --> 14:00.181
That if we didn't stand up to
bullies and try to educate people

14:00.215 --> 14:03.234
we wouldn't have civil
rights and marriage equality.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.455
OK. How's the new principal?

14:07.506 --> 14:11.059
[scoffs] More supportive than you.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.151
- [knocking]
- I'm in here!

14:20.185 --> 14:22.270
[Mariana] I just need
to grab some nail polish.

14:24.873 --> 14:26.207
Nice look.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.176
Take the nail polish and get out.

14:33.732 --> 14:36.718
Hmm, what do you think?
Cherry red or mint green?

14:36.752 --> 14:37.685
I don't care. Take them all.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.688
Seriously, what is with that towel?

14:40.690 --> 14:43.925
On my God! Moms are going to kill you!

14:43.959 --> 14:46.644
- Not if you don't tell them.
- Oh, I'm telling them.

14:48.614 --> 14:50.865
No. No! No! No! No! No!

14:50.899 --> 14:52.500
What do you want, huh?

14:53.569 --> 14:55.470
What do you want to keep your mouth shut?

14:55.504 --> 14:58.673
I know you want something.

15:00.376 --> 15:03.211
Hey. Uh, come on in.

15:07.349 --> 15:08.616
[door shuts]

15:20.172 --> 15:22.670
Uh, considering everything that
happened, I'd like to be present.

15:24.176 --> 15:25.096
It's fine.

15:25.911 --> 15:27.246
I'll be in the other room.

15:28.865 --> 15:30.666
OK, sit down.

15:33.086 --> 15:34.603
You changed your hair.

15:35.889 --> 15:38.657
Oh, uh, yeah.

15:39.860 --> 15:40.826
It nice.

15:42.629 --> 15:47.450
So, Stef, I want to thank you and
Lena for allowing me to do this.

15:48.535 --> 15:50.586
It was their choice.

15:50.637 --> 15:52.638
Well, thank you.

15:56.309 --> 15:57.510
[sobs quietly]

15:57.544 --> 16:01.514
I don't really know exactly where to start.

16:01.516 --> 16:04.116
I, um...

16:04.151 --> 16:06.452
I... I made an inventory.

16:08.421 --> 16:11.223
It's what they call it in AA.

16:11.225 --> 16:15.211
It's basically just a list of all
the terrible things I did to you

16:15.245 --> 16:19.999
and ways I let you down when
you were little and recently.

16:20.033 --> 16:22.168
It's long.

16:22.202 --> 16:24.203
It's too long.

16:24.254 --> 16:28.040
I think what I...

16:28.074 --> 16:29.909
... what I really want to say...

16:31.111 --> 16:33.662
... what I'm most ashamed of...

16:36.850 --> 16:40.953
... is that I loved getting
high more than I loved you.

16:42.589 --> 16:45.591
And it wasn't because you weren't lovable.

16:45.625 --> 16:48.661
You were beautiful children

16:48.712 --> 16:51.580
who just got a really raw
deal with me as your mother.

16:54.701 --> 16:58.704
I'm just so grateful that
God found you two great moms

16:58.738 --> 17:02.508
who could love you and take care
of you the way I should have.

17:07.146 --> 17:10.115
What we do in these cases is to
write a letter to the district

17:10.150 --> 17:12.184
as well as the State
Department of Education.

17:12.219 --> 17:16.155
For students engaged in bullying.
We're talking about a parent.

17:16.156 --> 17:19.191
Who is spreading rumors and
participating in exclusion.

17:19.226 --> 17:22.027
We don't know that he's told
anyone but his son and...

17:22.061 --> 17:25.079
- Me, in your presence...
- That he believes Jude is gay.

17:25.115 --> 17:27.132
He didn't say "believes" he said "is."

17:27.166 --> 17:29.018
He also said he doesn't
have a problem with it.

17:29.052 --> 17:32.771
He won't allow his son to share a tent
with Jude during a school supervised trip.

17:32.822 --> 17:34.974
But they weren't supervised, in the tent.

17:35.008 --> 17:36.041
What are you suggesting?

17:36.076 --> 17:37.977
I'm not suggesting anything.

17:38.011 --> 17:40.980
None of the boys or girls
were supervised in their tents.

17:40.982 --> 17:44.583
And Jude has not said he's gay. And
no one has the right to label anyone.

17:44.618 --> 17:47.686
I agree. And we don't have the
right to label the parent as a bully

17:47.721 --> 17:49.722
because he has rules
about who he allows his son

17:49.756 --> 17:51.657
to socialize with and
under what conditions.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.493
- I disagree.
- As a parent you have that right.

17:54.527 --> 17:56.862
But as Vice Principal of this
school it's a conflict of interest

17:56.897 --> 17:58.764
for you to use your position to retaliate.

17:58.798 --> 18:00.416
Retaliate?

18:00.450 --> 18:01.600
That's how it could be construed.

18:01.635 --> 18:03.352
And we can't afford to get sued.

18:04.738 --> 18:08.274
How about I just use my
position as a parent then?

18:11.544 --> 18:13.562
You should have asked me what happened.

18:13.597 --> 18:16.148
I did. You wouldn't talk about

18:16.199 --> 18:19.301
I didn't want to tell
you that my dad still...

18:21.087 --> 18:23.222
- ... spanks me.
- I'm sorry.

18:23.273 --> 18:25.057
I just...

18:26.526 --> 18:29.328
I know what it's like to get hit
and feel like you can't tell anyone.

18:32.132 --> 18:35.017
You didn't tell your mom what we did?

18:36.236 --> 18:37.269
Did you?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.121
No.

18:43.143 --> 18:47.780
So is there anything you want to say to me?

18:47.814 --> 18:49.932
It's OK, you can tell me how you feel.

18:49.966 --> 18:51.817
You can be honest.

18:53.620 --> 18:54.920
Mariana?

18:56.756 --> 19:00.442
I know you, I know you must have
something you want to say to me.

19:01.761 --> 19:03.462
[scoffs]

19:03.496 --> 19:06.632
You don't know me. You
don't know anything about me.

19:08.535 --> 19:12.471
You want me to be honest? I feel nothing.

19:12.505 --> 19:16.642
I look at you and you're nothing.

19:18.278 --> 19:20.496
You're just a very sad stranger.

19:24.551 --> 19:27.152
I'm done. I'll wait outside.

19:28.405 --> 19:29.521
[Ana sobs]

19:32.258 --> 19:34.093
Don't cry.

19:35.395 --> 19:37.146
She didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.248
- Don't do that.
- What?

19:39.282 --> 19:42.217
Don't try to take care of me.
You always used to do that.

19:42.252 --> 19:46.839
No matter how long I left you alone,

19:46.873 --> 19:48.073
to go get high...

19:48.124 --> 19:51.927
Mariana, she would always
get angry but you...

19:51.978 --> 19:54.146
You would never stay mad at me

19:54.180 --> 19:55.914
because I'd cry

19:55.949 --> 19:59.802
and you'd try to make me feel better.

20:04.891 --> 20:08.827
That was not your job then
and it's not your job now.

20:17.871 --> 20:20.606
[soft rock music]

20:24.444 --> 20:26.311
Hey.

20:29.382 --> 20:31.233
You OK?

20:33.370 --> 20:35.621
You told me DNA doesn't make a family.

20:37.457 --> 20:39.441
- It doesn't.
- Then why did you want a baby?

20:42.195 --> 20:44.263
[forced chuckle]

20:44.297 --> 20:46.432
I... I wanted...

20:46.466 --> 20:48.067
A real daughter.

20:48.101 --> 20:50.202
Honey, you are my real daughter.

20:52.038 --> 20:53.972
But I'll always be adopted.

20:55.892 --> 20:58.243
And Ana will always be my birth mother.

20:59.913 --> 21:03.098
I hate that I come from her.

21:04.184 --> 21:05.818
Why couldn't I come from you?

21:05.869 --> 21:08.987
Oh, my baby.

21:12.058 --> 21:17.496
I wish with all my heart that I
could have carried you inside me.

21:18.798 --> 21:20.866
Sometimes I...

21:20.900 --> 21:23.545
[sighs] ... I feel guilty
that I wasn't there for you

21:23.546 --> 21:24.546
from the moment you were born.

21:25.772 --> 21:27.806
But I realized something

21:27.841 --> 21:31.443
when I lost Frankie?

21:31.478 --> 21:35.681
Was that you only carry a baby
in your belly for nine months.

21:35.715 --> 21:38.550
But you carry your child
in your heart forever.

21:38.585 --> 21:41.253
That's the only place that it counts.

21:42.505 --> 21:45.290
You do come from me.

21:45.358 --> 21:47.292
And from Mom.

21:48.995 --> 21:51.213
And giving birth to you,

21:51.247 --> 21:53.298
that wouldn't have made me
love you any more than I do.

21:56.102 --> 21:58.036
Are you sure?

21:58.071 --> 21:59.204
Would it make you love me more?

21:59.239 --> 22:01.974
No. That's crazy.

22:02.008 --> 22:03.075
OK.

22:03.109 --> 22:07.079
So, how about we both
stop acting crazy, huh?

22:09.048 --> 22:11.049
Come here.

22:11.084 --> 22:13.652
[groans happily]

22:13.686 --> 22:15.921
- I love you.
- I love you.

you could relate to it.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.224
And this is who you think I am?

23:22.276 --> 23:24.944
It's kinda how you advertise.

23:24.995 --> 23:27.830
Did Mat tell you I have a history
of screwing guys in the band?

23:27.881 --> 23:29.098
He just said to be careful.

23:29.132 --> 23:31.017
Because I'm a cold-hearted bitch.

Believe I don't believe in Prince
Charming or happily ever after

23:35.122 --> 23:37.056
or "I can't live without you."

23:37.090 --> 23:39.875
- I think...
- You know what Mat didn't mention

23:39.910 --> 23:41.827
was that one of those guys
turned out to be a coke head

23:41.862 --> 23:43.946
and the other one was
a crazy jealous freak.

23:43.948 --> 23:45.881
He just doesn't want anything to happen.

23:47.684 --> 23:50.686
Well, neither do you. So what's the issue?

24:05.469 --> 24:11.207
<i>I really like Sia and Fiona
Apple and like Alana Davis.</i>

24:12.209 --> 24:14.293
Do you listen to them?

24:14.344 --> 24:17.396
Yeah, kinda. They're sort of depressing.

24:17.447 --> 24:21.467
I like music that's about something.

24:23.303 --> 24:26.355
- Is Brandon's band good?
- Yeah, they're awesome.

24:26.357 --> 24:30.159
So, like the guy you told
me about, before Wyatt,

24:30.177 --> 24:33.262
The one you loved, was it Brandon?

24:33.313 --> 24:36.198
- Why do you say that?
- Your eyes light up when you talk about him.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.918
Well, that's because he's my best friend.

24:40.137 --> 24:42.772
And my brother, soon.

24:44.908 --> 24:48.044
You know, Robert signed the papers?

24:49.680 --> 24:50.846
What about Wyatt?

24:50.848 --> 24:53.949
I don't know about Wyatt right now.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.752
Did you guys break up?

24:58.588 --> 24:59.555
I'm not sure.

25:03.410 --> 25:04.727
Why do you call our dad Robert?

25:04.761 --> 25:10.332
I guess, because Donald is my dad.

25:12.335 --> 25:13.502
Is it true?

25:15.439 --> 25:18.474
He killed your mom in a car accident?

25:18.508 --> 25:21.210
- Well, he was driving.
- And he went to jail?

25:21.212 --> 25:25.197
He was drinking, so,
yeah. But he's out now.

25:25.248 --> 25:27.183
So why aren't you and Jude with him?

25:27.217 --> 25:30.302
You know, he's just...
He can't take care of us.

25:30.337 --> 25:32.388
Our dad can take care of you.

25:32.390 --> 25:35.274
I'm getting adopted by Stef and Lena.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.159
Will we still be friends?

25:37.161 --> 25:39.929
Of course, yeah.

25:41.098 --> 25:42.198
We'll always be sisters.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.168
We should probably get some sleep.

25:49.723 --> 25:52.058
You should probably know, the guest room,

25:52.109 --> 25:53.876
it's haunted.

25:55.629 --> 25:57.980
[giggles] I'm kidding.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.649
But if you want, you can sleep in here.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.568
OK.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.398
<i>But sometimes I wake up</i>

26:16.433 --> 26:19.268
and see this woman standing
at the end of my bed.

26:19.302 --> 26:21.287
- [both giggle]
- Stop it!

26:44.311 --> 26:46.979
[woman chattering]

26:51.952 --> 26:54.036
[exhales deeply]

26:54.038 --> 26:56.188
Where did you get these?

26:56.223 --> 26:58.691
Rita told me about the pictures you took

26:58.742 --> 27:01.010
of some of the girls, that
helped them get foster families.

27:01.044 --> 27:05.681
And, you know, these
are really great photos.

27:05.715 --> 27:08.701
- You're talented.
- Thank you.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.921
And for doing this. It means a lot.

27:14.858 --> 27:17.526
Hello?

27:17.561 --> 27:18.894
Oh, wow, this is beautiful.

27:21.464 --> 27:22.631
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.767
Oh, my gosh, it's only been
one night, but we missed you.

27:24.818 --> 27:27.653
I missed you, too.

27:30.724 --> 27:34.276
Oh, my gosh, your hair is back.

27:34.311 --> 27:36.495
Well, it was never really gone.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.297
No, I missed brunette Mariana.

27:38.331 --> 27:40.132
Yeah, I did too.

27:40.183 --> 27:42.134
You just wanted to be the
only blonde in the house.

27:42.185 --> 27:44.019
You watch it.

27:44.070 --> 27:45.834
So, Rita and the girls are downstairs

27:45.835 --> 27:47.903
by the pool where
everything's kind of happening.

27:47.992 --> 27:50.092
They have a pool? Can I live here?

27:50.094 --> 27:52.011
[all chuckle]

27:54.998 --> 27:56.198
Hey hey, what's so important?

27:56.249 --> 27:58.300
Hayley's sort of freaking out.

27:58.335 --> 28:00.219
Oh. Why?

28:00.270 --> 28:03.022
She wanted me to blow this
off today to take care of her.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.157
I gotta take care of
myself sometimes, you know?

28:07.043 --> 28:08.878
Yeah, I do know.

28:11.848 --> 28:13.816
It was so good to meet you.

28:13.850 --> 28:16.151
I wouldn't mind living here.

28:16.153 --> 28:20.956
We'll be lucky to still live where
we do now that you quit your job.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.676
You must be Lena. I'm Jill.

28:23.727 --> 28:24.977
Hi. It's nice to finally meet you both.

28:25.011 --> 28:26.896
I'm Robert. Thanks for coming.

28:27.007 --> 28:29.975
Well, thank you for what you're
doing for Callie and for Girls United.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.860
It's our pleasure.

28:31.895 --> 28:35.531
And, uh, thank you, for signing the papers.

28:35.565 --> 28:37.666
Of course. I just want Callie to be happy.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.753
- Well, we love her very much.
- Mm.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.855
Yes, I can see that.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.441
How soon do you think
before you can adopt her?

28:45.475 --> 28:49.745
Well, we have to get a court
date, but a couple weeks, probably.

28:52.515 --> 28:55.417
Well, it looks like most everyone's here.

28:55.452 --> 28:57.653
Yes, uh, let's get this party started.

28:57.655 --> 28:58.737
Let's do it.

29:04.627 --> 29:06.562
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

29:06.613 --> 29:08.597
Thank you all for coming,
on such short notice.

29:08.631 --> 29:12.334
I guess now we know who
our real friends are.

29:12.336 --> 29:17.239
Jill and I, we recently heard
about Girls United through a friend.

29:18.341 --> 29:20.376
And we were very impressed

29:20.410 --> 29:23.295
by what this group home
does for at-risk girls,

29:23.346 --> 29:25.381
providing a safe and...

29:25.383 --> 29:29.051
You know, you look a
lot like a girl I know.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.037
Really?

29:32.072 --> 29:35.891
Unfortunately, they had a fire
recently and they lost their house.

29:35.925 --> 29:39.228
And that's really why we're here
today, it's to help raise money

29:39.230 --> 29:41.163
so that they can get a new home.

29:43.166 --> 29:45.884
She's a blonde.

29:45.919 --> 29:46.885
Who is?

29:46.920 --> 29:48.153
The girl you look like.

29:48.188 --> 29:49.938
Is she pretty?

29:49.989 --> 29:52.791
Not as pretty as you.

29:52.826 --> 29:55.961
But I've always been into brunettes.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.680
[Robert] ... enjoy Someone's Little Sister.

31:20.264 --> 31:23.932
for what you did for, well,
for not only Girls United

31:23.950 --> 31:27.219
but for having my back,
for not letting me give up.

31:28.922 --> 31:31.089
It's really Robert we should thank.

31:31.141 --> 31:34.059
But I know it wasn't easy for
you, to ask him to do this.

31:34.110 --> 31:37.830
Oh, he signed the papers.
So I can get adopted.

31:37.864 --> 31:39.031
That's great.

31:39.082 --> 31:41.884
And he's not making me sign the, uh,

31:41.935 --> 31:44.019
liability waiver, whatever.

31:44.053 --> 31:45.721
Right, yeah.

31:45.772 --> 31:48.824
So he said that he trusts that

31:48.826 --> 31:51.660
I don't want anything from him.

31:51.711 --> 31:55.514
And why? Why don't you
want anything from him?

31:56.866 --> 32:00.402
- Like money?
- No.

32:00.436 --> 32:01.670
Like a relationship.

32:03.506 --> 32:05.674
I mean, it's quite obvious,
Callie, he loves you.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.360
He barely knows me.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.562
Oh, now come on.

32:10.613 --> 32:12.531
It doesn't take very
long to love you, Callie.

32:12.565 --> 32:15.384
You're pretty amazing, you are.

32:15.418 --> 32:17.469
You're kind, you've got
a compassionate heart.

32:17.504 --> 32:21.523
And besides, you're his daughter.

32:23.326 --> 32:24.409
So.

32:24.460 --> 32:28.263
So he never had the chance
to be a father to you and,

32:28.298 --> 32:31.016
I mean, it's pretty
clear that he wants to be.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.986
If you'll let him.

32:34.037 --> 32:37.372
I just... I really can't
figure out why you wouldn't.

I'm just saying that
maybe it's not too late

32:59.689 --> 33:00.689
to get back the job you have and love.

33:01.693 --> 33:04.161
And what about Jude? Who fights for him?

33:04.212 --> 33:07.325
I do. It's not a conflict of
interest for me to write a letter.

33:07.336 --> 33:10.304
Frankly, I think that there's
some grey area here, Lena.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.140
So you agree with Monte?

33:12.142 --> 33:14.909
- I'm not saying that...
- Hey.

33:14.943 --> 33:17.862
Hey. I didn't know you were coming.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.014
- Yeah, I wanted to make a donation.
- Oh, that's nice.

33:20.048 --> 33:22.016
- You should check out the silent auction.
- Yeah?

33:22.050 --> 33:24.018
But don't you dare outbid me
on that trip to Puerto Rico.

33:24.052 --> 33:25.853
Like that's gonna happen.

33:25.855 --> 33:27.939
Excuse me. I need something to drink.

33:27.990 --> 33:31.859
[music continues]

33:35.931 --> 33:40.568
So, how are the kids?
After meeting with Ana?

33:41.737 --> 33:43.604
They're OK. They're OK.

33:43.639 --> 33:46.474
At the moment, I'm a little bit
more concerned about my wife.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.776
- Why? What's going on?
- She quit her job.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.629
What? Why?

33:51.663 --> 33:54.515
Not for the reason that she thinks.

33:54.550 --> 33:57.852
In my opinion, I think she lost
the principal job and the baby.

33:57.854 --> 34:02.540
And she wants control over
something and sometimes...

34:02.591 --> 34:04.425
The only control you have is to quit.

34:06.595 --> 34:08.563
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

34:08.597 --> 34:10.630
- [music ends]
- [applause]

34:12.734 --> 34:15.418
Thank you. Thanks for listening.

34:15.471 --> 34:17.554
Uh, we're gonna go ahead and
turn it over to the people

34:17.589 --> 34:20.174
you really came to hear from. Callie?

34:20.208 --> 34:22.443
[applause]

34:30.351 --> 34:33.286
Hi. My name's Callie.

34:33.322 --> 34:39.126
And I... I was at Girls United.

34:39.161 --> 34:43.281
At first, I didn't think I
belonged there, no one does.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.081
[Callie giggles]

34:45.117 --> 34:49.003
But Rita, the amazing woman
that runs the whole thing,

34:49.054 --> 34:54.225
she... she doesn't let you get
away with your... bad word deleted.

34:54.275 --> 34:55.860
[quiet laughter]

34:55.911 --> 34:58.112
Not because she's a hard ass, which she is,

34:58.146 --> 35:00.932
but because she cares.

35:00.966 --> 35:05.920
She really cares about every
girl that walks through her door.

35:05.954 --> 35:09.023
And it's because of her and the other girls

35:09.057 --> 35:12.593
and my wonderful brother and foster family,

35:12.644 --> 35:16.614
that I finally believed I
could have faith in my future.

35:16.648 --> 35:20.701
Rita, you are the heart
and soul of Girls United.

35:20.703 --> 35:23.471
You work tirelessly for not much money

35:23.505 --> 35:25.673
and not a lot of gratitude.

35:25.675 --> 35:28.359
But thank you for not giving up.

35:28.410 --> 35:30.795
You've given me the courage

35:30.829 --> 35:35.349
to embrace everything that I am.

35:35.384 --> 35:39.487
And to not be afraid of accepting love.

35:41.490 --> 35:43.491
So I want to acknowledge Robert Quinn...

35:45.427 --> 35:49.230
for not only being a really nice guy

35:49.264 --> 35:50.398
but for being my father.

35:52.451 --> 35:55.169
It's a long story.

35:55.171 --> 35:58.272
We only really found out
about each other recently.

35:58.307 --> 36:03.110
But I'm really grateful
to have him in my life now.

36:05.197 --> 36:08.382
So thank you, Robert and thank you Jill

36:08.417 --> 36:12.086
and my sister, Sophia

36:12.088 --> 36:14.088
for being so kind to me.

36:15.107 --> 36:17.959
- And now, Rita?
- [applause]

36:25.050 --> 36:27.885
Hi, everyone, I'm Rita Hendricks.

36:27.936 --> 36:31.022
I met most of you at this amazing event.

36:31.056 --> 36:32.974
I really don't know what to say.

36:32.991 --> 36:36.794
We thought Girls United
was over but, I don't know,

36:36.828 --> 36:38.212
love can move mountains, make miracles

36:38.214 --> 36:41.182
and maybe just get us a new house.

36:41.216 --> 36:45.152
I'll never forget this night and, um...

36:45.187 --> 36:48.706
... we all thank you, very much.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.658
[applause]

36:52.094 --> 36:55.763
- Come here.
- OK. OK. What'd you have to tell me?

36:55.797 --> 36:56.931
It's not too late!

36:56.965 --> 36:58.065
What's not?

36:58.100 --> 36:59.900
For us to be a family.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.623
Sophia, I'm getting adopted by the Fosters.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.541
Dad didn't sign the papers.

37:07.592 --> 37:11.562
I mean, he did but they
didn't actually ever get sent

37:11.596 --> 37:13.514
Because I took them out of
the mail and I ripped them up.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.478
Hey.

37:26.529 --> 37:29.715
So are you OK?

37:29.749 --> 37:33.502
That Callie acknowledged Robert and Sophia?

37:33.553 --> 37:35.470
Yeah. Are you?

37:35.505 --> 37:36.505
I think so.

37:36.556 --> 37:38.323
Yeah.

37:41.444 --> 37:42.711
Did you quit your job because of me?

37:42.745 --> 37:45.664
How did you know about that?

37:45.666 --> 37:48.600
I overheard. Sorry.

37:52.605 --> 37:54.523
- [forced chuckle]
- Is it my fault?

37:54.574 --> 37:56.575
- No.
- No.

37:56.577 --> 38:01.263
No, I quit my job because someone
has to stand up to bullying.

38:03.299 --> 38:05.695
I'm your mom first, and I
care more about defending you

38:05.696 --> 38:07.345
than I do about keeping my job.

38:10.206 --> 38:12.090
You shouldn't, defend me.

38:12.125 --> 38:13.325
Why not?

38:15.128 --> 38:19.231
Because we did do something
on the camping trip that was...

38:19.265 --> 38:21.399
... wrong, I guess.

38:26.205 --> 38:29.207
Dad, please listen, OK, I just thought

38:29.242 --> 38:32.060
if she had more time that
she would see we're a family.

38:32.095 --> 38:34.312
The Fosters are my family.

38:34.363 --> 38:36.148
You just told everyone we are.

38:38.167 --> 38:42.170
Sophia, let me talk to Callie alone, OK?

38:50.897 --> 38:52.981
[exhales deeply] I'm
trying not to be mad at her.

38:55.001 --> 38:56.868
[exhales deeply] I think she's just...

38:56.870 --> 38:58.837
Gotten attached to you.

39:00.973 --> 39:02.140
Yeah, we all have.

39:04.861 --> 39:07.662
So how long do you think
until you can get new copies?

39:07.697 --> 39:09.915
[sighs]

39:13.719 --> 39:14.836
I can't.

39:18.057 --> 39:22.561
I can't sign the papers, again.

39:22.612 --> 39:24.613
Signing them the first time,

39:24.664 --> 39:26.948
was the hardest thing
that I have ever done.

39:26.999 --> 39:31.753
And after hearing you today,
say that... I'm your father...

39:33.639 --> 39:36.775
I can't abandon you. I
know it's what you want.

39:38.778 --> 39:39.744
I love you.

39:39.779 --> 39:42.731
I don't love you.

39:42.782 --> 39:44.866
And I will never live
in this house with you.

39:44.901 --> 39:46.902
And I will never call you my father again.

39:46.953 --> 39:48.837
- Wait, Callie...
- No, you promised me!

39:48.871 --> 39:51.873
I know. I do, I want you to be happy

39:51.924 --> 39:55.510
I won't be happy. I'm
never going to be happy.

39:59.599 --> 40:02.851
I'm so sorry, OK? I just
want you to be with us.

40:02.902 --> 40:04.736
I'm your sister.

40:04.770 --> 40:07.489
No, you're not. You're
a spoiled little brat.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.875

Hey, Callie? What's going on?

40:43.726 --> 40:45.427
Robert's not letting me get adopted.

40:45.478 --> 40:47.345
I thought he signed the papers?

40:47.396 --> 40:48.422
I can't believe how stupid I am.

40:48.423 --> 40:50.523
I knew I couldn't trust
him. I can't trust anything.

40:50.566 --> 40:52.767
And I knew this was gonna
happen, Brandon, I knew it.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.736
Come here, come here, sit down with me.

41:00.860 --> 41:04.579
Take some breaths. OK,
just take some deep breaths.

41:05.831 --> 41:06.831
[exhales deeply]

41:09.418 --> 41:12.370
No matter what, they can't
make you live with them.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.758
We'll still be your family.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.795
I'm never getting adopted.

41:20.846 --> 41:21.763
You don't know that.

41:21.797 --> 41:24.466
Yes I do.

41:24.517 --> 41:26.651
If Robert doesn't sign the papers.

41:28.421 --> 41:30.322
Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be,

41:30.356 --> 41:33.642
Maybe this is the way it
was always supposed to be.

41:37.430 --> 41:40.482
I gave up so much to be adopted.
