00:20.387 --> 00:21.784
Maybe you didn't notice the way

00:21.785 --> 00:23.549
my lawyer was looking at your fiancÃ©e.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.281
What are you talking about?

00:25.282 --> 00:27.679
Or the way she was looking back at him.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.743
Charlie, that guy is everything you're not.

00:32.508 --> 00:35.238
<i>* Men. *</i>

00:37.837 --> 00:39.234
Where the hell is she, Alan?

00:39.235 --> 00:40.966
Calm down; don't work yourself into a tizzy.

00:40.967 --> 00:42.732
A tizzy?

00:42.733 --> 00:44.429
I don't have tizzies.

00:44.430 --> 00:46.594
Women have tizzies. You have tizzies.

00:47.594 --> 00:51.923
Me, I am outraged,
I am furious, I am, I am...

00:51.924 --> 00:53.055
Miffed?

00:53.056 --> 00:54.953
Do not complete my sentences

00:54.954 --> 00:56.418
if you don't grasp the concept.

00:56.419 --> 00:58.316
Sorry.

00:58.317 --> 00:59.915
She should've been home hours ago.

00:59.916 --> 01:01.614
I'm sure there's a
perfectly good explanation.

01:01.615 --> 01:03.246
Oh, really? And what would that be?

01:03.247 --> 01:05.610
Okay, well, after the barbecue ended,

01:05.611 --> 01:07.308
Chelsea stayed behind to help clean up.

01:07.309 --> 01:09.573
And then she and Brad got to talking

01:09.574 --> 01:11.271
about all the things they have in common.

01:11.272 --> 01:14.035
You know, their love of horses, children...

01:14.036 --> 01:16.100
Probably just lost track of time.

01:16.101 --> 01:17.864
Because, you know, he's so easy to talk to.

01:17.865 --> 01:19.197
Not to mention how...

01:19.198 --> 01:21.028
good-looking he is.

01:22.195 --> 01:24.625
Or she got diarrhea.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.756
Oh, maybe she called.

01:26.757 --> 01:29.421
Oh, look, there's two messages.

01:30.844 --> 01:32.727
This is Jenny from Malibu Day Spa.

01:32.762 --> 01:34.735
I just wanted to confirm
your Saturday appointment

01:34.770 --> 01:36.138
for a bikini wax.

01:39.056 --> 01:40.434
Bikini wax?!

01:40.469 --> 01:42.342
Uh, I wear a European-cut bathing suit.

01:42.377 --> 01:44.058
I like to keep it tidy down there.

01:44.093 --> 01:46.902
Anyway, I'm sure the next one is Chelsea.

01:46.937 --> 01:49.568
Hi, Mr. Harper. This is Jenny again.

01:49.603 --> 01:51.319
Just a reminder- we can no longer accept

01:51.354 --> 01:52.661
a personal check from you...

01:53.223 --> 01:56.143
I should've just gone with her
to that stupid charity thing.

01:56.178 --> 01:57.398
True. If you'd made a little effort,

01:57.433 --> 01:58.697
you wouldn't be in this situation.

01:58.732 --> 02:00.767
But I bet she knew I wouldn't go

02:00.802 --> 02:01.523
when she asked me.

02:01.558 --> 02:03.731
In fact, I bet she was
counting on me not going,

02:03.765 --> 02:05.630
so she could be alone with this Brad guy.

02:05.665 --> 02:06.979
Do you really think Chelsea
would do something like that?

02:07.014 --> 02:08.239
Why not? That's what I'd do.

02:09.614 --> 02:11.475
I mean, hypothetically.

02:11.509 --> 02:13.401
If I were ever in that situation.

02:13.436 --> 02:15.176
Again.

02:16.007 --> 02:17.165
Right.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.953
The point is, I've been honest
through this whole thing.

02:19.988 --> 02:21.422
She's the one who's been deceitful.

02:21.457 --> 02:23.319
She's nothing but a manipulative,

02:23.353 --> 02:25.463
calculating, two-faced... Hey, honey.

02:25.498 --> 02:27.123
(sweetly): Oh, hi, baby.

02:28.531 --> 02:29.657
How was the party?

02:29.692 --> 02:30.711
It was great.

02:30.746 --> 02:33.377
There was, like, 80 kids
taking turns riding a horse

02:33.412 --> 02:34.816
for the first time in their lives.

02:35.224 --> 02:37.231
So, what, there was just one horse?

02:37.698 --> 02:38.753
No.

02:38.788 --> 02:40.684
Good, 'cause that would've
been a tough day for the horse.

02:41.783 --> 02:44.306
Sorry I'm late, but after we got
the kids back on the busses,

02:44.341 --> 02:46.896
a bunch of us hung out to
chat and help clean up.

02:46.931 --> 02:48.614
Yeah, yeah, that's what I figured.

02:50.122 --> 02:52.293
I just want to jump in
the shower and go to bed.

02:52.328 --> 02:53.774
Okay, I'll be right up.

02:53.809 --> 02:55.287
Night, Alan. Night.

02:55.321 --> 02:57.366
Glad you had a good time.

02:58.072 --> 02:59.374
Well done.

02:59.409 --> 03:02.363
You sublimated your anger and
came from a place of love.

03:02.398 --> 03:03.424
You took the high road.

03:03.459 --> 03:05.322
Really? Is that what you call it?

03:05.357 --> 03:07.454
'Cause I call it a
complete and total betrayal

03:07.489 --> 03:08.724
of my testicles.

03:11.253 --> 03:12.789
If you'd done it as much as I had,

03:12.824 --> 03:14.261
you'd call it the high road.

03:14.296 --> 03:17.287
* Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *

03:17.322 --> 03:20.558
* Ah. * * Men. * * Men. *

03:27.078 --> 03:28.134
Hey, Chels?

03:28.169 --> 03:31.124
So, when you say a bunch
of you stayed to clean up,

03:31.159 --> 03:32.877
how many are you talking about?

03:32.912 --> 03:34.501
I don't know; a couple.

03:34.535 --> 03:36.297
Uh-huh.

03:37.695 --> 03:40.225
You know, technically, a couple is two.

03:40.260 --> 03:41.882
So are you saying there were two people

03:41.917 --> 03:44.345
in addition to you and
Brad or just you and Brad?

03:44.380 --> 03:46.131
What are you getting at?

03:46.166 --> 03:48.559
Nothing. Just trying to get
an accurate head count.

03:48.594 --> 03:50.587
You could've come with me, you know.

03:50.622 --> 03:51.780
I know.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.910
to do some things together once in a while.

03:55.576 --> 03:57.080
We do plenty of things together.

03:57.115 --> 03:58.517
Besides sex.

03:58.552 --> 03:59.880
Oh...

04:01.286 --> 04:03.860
When Brad's wife was alive,
they played tennis every day.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.582
Probably what killed her.

04:06.457 --> 04:08.108
She was hit by a car.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.580
Maybe she was chasing a tennis ball.

04:13.681 --> 04:15.815
You know, like a dog.

04:17.178 --> 04:19.333
You throw it, they run after it,

04:19.368 --> 04:20.776
even if there's traffic...

04:21.505 --> 04:23.921
Goofy dogs.

04:27.437 --> 04:29.435
<i>* Men. *</i>

04:30.870 --> 04:32.693
(crowd cheering)

04:32.728 --> 04:35.076
What the hell is that?

04:35.111 --> 04:38.166
Two guys in a cage beating
the snot out of each other.

04:38.941 --> 04:41.883
I can't believe I wasted so
many years watching cartoons.

04:42.759 --> 04:44.550
Turn it down.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.333
Aye, aye, Captain Douche.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.540
What did you say?

04:48.575 --> 04:50.573
Aye, aye, Captain. I'll do that.

04:52.514 --> 04:55.001
Why are you on the couch?
You and Chelsea have a fight?

04:55.036 --> 04:56.656
No, we didn't have a fight.

04:56.691 --> 04:58.273
Were you farting in your sleep?

04:58.902 --> 04:59.984
No.

05:00.019 --> 05:01.316
Did you screw up the sex?

05:02.439 --> 05:04.007
What the hell are you talking about?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.853
You know, there's more than
one way to satisfy a woman.

05:06.888 --> 05:08.889
Oh, really? Like what?

01:19.745 --> 05:08.924
I'm not sure.

05:11.623 --> 05:13.467
Get out!

05:13.502 --> 05:14.505
Fine.

05:16.473 --> 05:19.425
We wouldn't have these problems
if you just put a TV in my room.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.836
We wouldn't have these problems

05:20.871 --> 05:23.050
if I just put a python in your room.

05:23.085 --> 05:25.519
TouchA(Copyright), douchA(Copyright).

05:25.554 --> 05:26.553
What?

05:26.588 --> 05:28.421
I said touchA(Copyright), douchA(Copyright).

05:34.889 --> 05:37.311
BERTA: * I really can't stay *

05:37.346 --> 05:40.270
(in deep voice): * Baby, it's cold outside *

05:40.305 --> 05:42.207
(normal voice): * I've got to go away *

05:42.242 --> 05:44.804
(deep voice): * Baby, it's cold outside... *

05:44.839 --> 05:46.590
You mind? I'm trying to sleep.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.761
Hey, I didn't see you there.

05:48.796 --> 05:50.094
What'd you do?

05:50.128 --> 05:51.877
I don't want to talk about it.

05:51.912 --> 05:54.120
Fine. I'm not one to pry.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.764
Money?

05:58.799 --> 06:00.372
No.

06:00.407 --> 06:01.710
Old girlfriend?

06:01.745 --> 06:02.868
No.

06:02.903 --> 06:04.725
She find those Polaroids?

06:04.760 --> 06:05.951
No.

06:07.247 --> 06:09.000
How did you know about the Polaroids?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.043
You just told me, you dirtbag.

06:12.021 --> 06:14.511
So, what did you do,

06:14.546 --> 06:16.161
try to sneak in at 2:00 a.m.

06:16.196 --> 06:18.231
smellin' of booze and pole dancer?

06:18.543 --> 06:21.631
For your information,
Chelsea's the one who came home late.

06:21.666 --> 06:23.528
And she was smelling of horse.

06:23.563 --> 06:26.100
Oh, good Lord, Charlie,
you can't compete with a horse.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.592
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

06:27.627 --> 06:28.809
Seriously.

06:28.844 --> 06:33.371
and you're blessed,
but you ain't no Seabiscuit.

06:33.948 --> 06:37.317
When have you seen my... tallywacker?

06:37.352 --> 06:41.388
I don't know, maybe the nine or
ten times I found you passed out

06:41.423 --> 06:44.372
in your bathtub, holding onto it
like it was a flotation device.

06:45.811 --> 06:47.211
Sorry about that.

06:47.246 --> 06:48.479
Don't be.

06:56.710 --> 06:57.936
Mmm, boy!

06:58.810 --> 07:00.179
Breakfast,

07:00.214 --> 07:03.407
the most important meal of the day.

07:03.442 --> 07:05.263
Three scrambled egg whites,

07:05.298 --> 07:09.152
two slices of "I can't believe
it's not buttered" rye toast

07:09.187 --> 07:10.905
and to flush it through me,

07:10.940 --> 07:14.530
a piping hot cup of freshly ground coffee.

07:14.565 --> 07:16.847
(coffee grinder whirring)

07:16.882 --> 07:18.638
Shut that thing off!

07:18.673 --> 07:19.720
(whirring resumes)

07:51.807 --> 07:54.591
Don't push me. I'm not in the mood.

07:54.626 --> 07:56.637
Did you sleep on the couch last night?

07:56.672 --> 07:58.074
What's it to ya?

07:58.109 --> 07:59.408
Oh, Charlie, what'd you do?

07:59.443 --> 08:01.341
Nothing. Nothing?

08:01.376 --> 08:05.764
I may have compared Brad's
recently deceased wife

08:05.799 --> 08:07.768
to a ball-chasing dog.

08:07.803 --> 08:09.830
Whose balls?

08:09.865 --> 08:12.529
Tennis balls.

08:12.564 --> 08:14.531
Get your mind out of the gutter.

08:14.566 --> 08:17.903
All right, look- while this is
admittedly a bump in the road,

08:17.938 --> 08:19.583
you do have an opportunity here

08:19.618 --> 08:21.654
to really improve your
relationship with Chelsea.

08:21.689 --> 08:23.275
How do you figure?

08:23.309 --> 08:24.324
Well, think about it-

08:24.359 --> 08:25.792
the reason you're threatened by Brad

08:25.827 --> 08:27.924
is because he's a much better man than you.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.476
No, he's not.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.393
I would never come on to
another guy's fiancA(Copyright)e.

08:34.428 --> 08:35.755
Okay, first of all, we don't know

08:35.789 --> 08:36.977
that he's come on to Chelsea.

08:37.013 --> 08:38.736
And secondly, I've seen you hit on a bride

08:38.770 --> 08:40.107
while she was walking down the aisle.

08:40.143 --> 08:41.774
That was a joke.

08:41.808 --> 08:44.483
I asked her what she was doing later.
Everybody laughed.

08:44.518 --> 08:47.702
My point is, if Chelsea is
looking around for a better guy,

08:47.737 --> 08:50.060
why not make that guy you?

08:50.095 --> 08:52.941
Because I'm not a better guy than me.

08:53.891 --> 08:55.191
Not yet.

08:55.226 --> 08:57.715
But you do have something going
for you that Brad doesn't.

08:57.750 --> 08:58.596
What's that?

08:58.631 --> 09:00.664
Room to improve.

09:01.549 --> 09:05.799
Lots and lots of room to improve.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.747
***

09:08.782 --> 09:10.570
And keep in mind, you're the underdog here,

09:10.605 --> 09:12.014
and everybody loves an underdog.

09:12.049 --> 09:15.138
Then how come nobody loves you?

09:15.173 --> 09:18.653
The principle is still sound.

09:18.688 --> 09:21.111
Just go up there and tell Chelsea you know

09:21.146 --> 09:22.348
that you're a flawed human being,

09:22.383 --> 09:25.932
but that you will spend the rest
of your life trying to be better

09:25.967 --> 09:28.181
because she deserves the best.

09:28.798 --> 09:31.259
So, lie.

09:31.294 --> 09:32.651
You don't have to lie.

09:32.686 --> 09:34.130
Don't you think you're a flawed human being?

09:34.165 --> 09:36.381
Of course I do. But I know me.

09:36.416 --> 09:38.698
I'm not gonna spend the rest
of my life doing anything,

09:38.733 --> 09:40.841
let alone try to be a better human being.

09:40.876 --> 09:42.528
Oh, come on, Charlie.

09:42.563 --> 09:44.954
Look at every New Year's
resolution I've ever made.

09:44.989 --> 09:48.468
I've got the best of intentions,
but by January third or fourth,

09:48.503 --> 09:51.385
there I am broke, hung over,
and coughing up stripper glitter.

09:52.346 --> 09:53.819
Okay, lie.

09:55.325 --> 09:58.381
<i>* Men. *</i>

09:58.994 --> 10:02.088
Hey Chels... I brought
you some orange juice.

10:02.687 --> 10:03.776
Thank you.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.664
Is there any coffee?

10:04.699 --> 10:07.615
No, no, my stupid brother broke the grinder.

10:11.324 --> 10:13.528
There's vodka in this orange juice.

10:13.563 --> 10:16.815
Whoopsie, that's mine.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.820
It's 8:00 in the morning.

10:18.855 --> 10:21.255
Hence the orange juice.

10:24.099 --> 10:28.940
about my unfortunate remarks last night.

10:28.975 --> 10:32.686
And tell you I love you and
I'll spend the rest of my life

10:32.720 --> 10:35.712
trying to be a better man
because you deserve the best.

10:35.747 --> 10:38.033
Well, I appreciate you saying that.

10:38.068 --> 10:41.335
So... we're good?

10:41.370 --> 10:43.480
Yeah.

10:43.515 --> 10:45.065
Great.

10:45.099 --> 10:47.109
So what do you want to do today?

10:47.144 --> 10:48.973
Your choice - whatever
makes you happy. Really?

10:49.008 --> 10:51.227
I'll go anywhere, I'll do anything.

10:51.262 --> 10:53.155
Of course, you'll have to drive.

10:53.190 --> 10:56.351
Well, I was thinking of
going to Beverly Hills

10:56.386 --> 10:57.626
for this charity blood drive.

10:57.661 --> 10:58.406
Great.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.707
We'll give blood together.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.235
Nothing I like better on a Sunday

11:01.270 --> 11:03.270
than tapping a vein for a good cause.

11:03.305 --> 11:05.585
Terrific. Brad will be happy to see us.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.659
Brad?

11:07.694 --> 11:08.998
It's his charity.

11:09.033 --> 11:11.705
He's got another charity?

11:11.740 --> 11:12.945
What the hell's this guy's problem?

11:12.980 --> 11:15.435
It's not a problem, Charlie.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.715
He's a very caring and compassionate man.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.331
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a freakin' saint.

11:20.150 --> 11:23.108
And you were already
planning on seeing him again.

11:23.143 --> 11:24.975
Well, yeah. He told me

11:25.010 --> 11:26.102
about the blood drive last night.

11:26.137 --> 11:29.124
Right, right, while you were "cleaning up."

11:29.159 --> 11:30.848
What's "this"?

11:30.883 --> 11:33.201
Oh, I think you know what "this" is.

11:33.236 --> 11:35.914
Just go to hell!

11:35.949 --> 11:37.115
Hey, hey-hey,

11:37.150 --> 11:39.255
I'm not the one sneakin'
around seeing somebody

11:39.290 --> 11:40.871
behind my fiancA(Copyright)'s back!

11:40.906 --> 11:42.437
I am not sneaking around!

11:43.563 --> 11:44.973
Figuring that I wouldn't.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.327
Very sneaky!

11:46.362 --> 11:47.416
Drop dead!

11:47.451 --> 11:51.389
(grinder whirrs, revving up)

11:51.424 --> 11:52.621
Fixed it.

So...

12:06.215 --> 12:10.640
*****

12:12.267 --> 12:15.116
Okay, first of all,
I have nothing to be sorry about.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.757
And second, I am not gonna
discuss my personal life

12:17.792 --> 12:19.937
with someone whose current
girlfriend is a gym sock.

12:20.653 --> 12:22.665
Wow, no wonder she left.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.535
You just lash out for no reason.

12:25.685 --> 12:27.048
EVELYN: Hello?

12:27.083 --> 12:28.525
Out here!

12:28.560 --> 12:30.142
That's my reason.

12:30.177 --> 12:31.821
Boo-hoo. When you gonna stop

12:31.855 --> 12:33.435
blaming your problems on your mommy?

12:35.966 --> 12:36.678
Hey, boys.

12:36.713 --> 12:38.229
Charlie, where's your bride-to-be?

12:38.264 --> 12:39.632
We were gonna finalize the guest list.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.109
She's not here.

12:41.143 --> 12:42.304
She told him to go to hell.

12:42.339 --> 12:44.482
Will you please shut up?

12:44.517 --> 12:46.869
Oh, Charles, what did you do?

12:46.904 --> 12:48.764
<i>I didn't do anything!</i>

12:48.799 --> 12:50.449
He slept on the couch last night.

12:50.484 --> 12:52.594
Nobody's talking to you!

12:52.629 --> 12:54.807
And this is what we've been living with.

12:56.272 --> 12:59.816
Stop heating your socks in the
microwave, you little freak!

13:00.657 --> 13:03.461
Charlie, please don't
let this girl get away.

13:03.496 --> 13:04.830
Don't worry, I won't.

13:04.864 --> 13:06.585
Good, 'cause she's one in a million

13:06.620 --> 13:08.519
and you're a dime a dozen.

13:08.554 --> 13:12.829
Yeah, but I'm the underdog,
and everybody loves the underdog.

13:12.864 --> 13:15.287
Oh, God, now you sound like your brother.

13:17.059 --> 13:18.885
How do you plan on getting her back?

13:18.920 --> 13:21.381
I'm gonna become a better man.

13:21.416 --> 13:24.543
Great, so no plan at all.

13:25.796 --> 13:28.011
<i>* Men. *</i>

13:34.404 --> 13:36.374
What's the forecast?

13:36.879 --> 13:40.249
(slurring): High tonight, low tomorrow.

13:40.284 --> 13:43.734
A hundred-percent chance of hangover.

13:45.005 --> 13:46.088
Heard from Chelsea?

13:46.122 --> 13:50.081
She's staying with her
father for a few days.

13:50.116 --> 13:52.754
At least that's what she e-mailed me.

13:52.789 --> 13:55.040
You don't think she could be with...

13:55.075 --> 13:57.889
Go ahead, say it.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.935
Braa-ad!

14:03.047 --> 14:04.294
You know what?

14:04.329 --> 14:05.851
If she is, fine.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.045
Good riddance.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.001
I was never meant to be tied
down to one woman, anyway.

14:10.036 --> 14:11.930
Well, you are by nature a free spirit.

14:11.965 --> 14:14.036
(sobbing): I miss her, Alan!

14:14.071 --> 14:16.639
I can't live without her!

14:16.674 --> 14:18.048
And you don't have to.

14:18.082 --> 14:19.220
Remember our talk?

14:19.255 --> 14:20.242
Becoming a better man?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.107
Screw it!

14:21.142 --> 14:23.138
I'm as good as I'm ever gonna be!

14:23.173 --> 14:24.931
If she doesn't like it, the hell with her!

14:24.966 --> 14:27.393
That is true. In a healthy relationship,

14:27.428 --> 14:29.352
your partner needs to
accept you for who you are.

14:30.007 --> 14:33.543
(sobbing): Oh, she deserves
better than me, Alan!

14:33.578 --> 14:36.246
She's such a wonderful gal!

14:36.281 --> 14:37.519
I know, I know.

14:37.554 --> 14:39.913
She's-she's like an angel!

14:39.948 --> 14:42.726
She... She sure is.

14:42.761 --> 14:46.346
Then why is she running off with Braa-ad?

14:49.007 --> 14:52.797
This is not angel behavior, Alan.

14:52.832 --> 14:54.463
You know what kind of behavior this is?

14:54.498 --> 14:57.241
Charlie behavior.

14:58.730 --> 15:02.187

and I turned her into me!

O- Okay. Well...

why don't you stay here

15:32.328 --> 15:33.877
and I'll go sleep in your room.

15:33.912 --> 15:35.651
No, no, no, don't go.

You're wearing pajama bottoms, right?

15:47.822 --> 15:49.577
Shh...

15:50.595 --> 15:53.234
Exactly how drunk are you?

15:56.533 --> 15:58.352
Both questions...

15:58.387 --> 16:00.026
asked and answered.

16:17.335 --> 16:19.918
No... no, he's up.

16:19.953 --> 16:22.375

16:41.144 --> 16:42.412
You got a phone call.

17:48.199 --> 17:50.908
So, what's new?

No, no, we don't.

17:54.626 --> 17:56.037
I'm sorry.

The reason I got so upset

18:16.861 --> 18:18.130

18:18.165 --> 18:20.767
well, you kind of touched a nerve.

18:20.802 --> 18:22.914
Yeah, I do that. I'm a nerve toucher.

Yes, Charlie, it's important to me.

18:56.607 --> 18:57.527
Okay.

Did you and Brad do
anything other than talk?

work on our relationship?</i>

fall and can't get up.

20:54.890 --> 20:58.441
Yeah, well... I guess I kinda had it coming.

20:58.476 --> 21:00.440
But you tried.

21:01.530 --> 21:03.184
I did.

21:05.162 --> 21:07.513
I just have one question.

21:08.674 --> 21:09.762
What's that?

21:09.797 --> 21:12.467
Did you really vomit on a baby?

21:18.125 --> 21:20.694
Don't beat yourself up too much.

21:20.729 --> 21:22.345
We've all done that.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.876
You're kidding.

most of us do it on our own babies.
