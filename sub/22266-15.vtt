WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.493
OLIVER: <i>My name is
Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:05.378
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.464 --> 00:08.798
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:08.884 --> 00:11.342
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:13.795
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:13.889 --> 00:15.755
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:15.933 --> 00:18.220
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:20.302
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:20.938 --> 00:22.099
OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:22.272 --> 00:24.264
The new police captain,
she's on my payroll,

00:24.358 --> 00:26.224
<i>along with a few other
city officials.</i>

00:26.318 --> 00:28.480
<i>See, guys like you never understand.</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:31.313
<i>Why destroy a city,
when you could take it over?</i>

00:33.492 --> 00:35.779
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.531
The injury caused his lung
to recollapse.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.199
Oliver Queen, you're under arrest.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.530
On what charges?

00:40.624 --> 00:42.957
Murder, assault, burglary,
and kidnapping,

00:43.043 --> 00:45.376
all stemming from your activity
as the Green Arrow.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.494
I think I just found something.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.170
There's a record on how Watson
found out you were Wild Dog.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.338
There's an audio recording.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.963
The FBI's provided definitive proof
that Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.544
I'm gonna release
the defendant on bail.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.506
What's your name?

00:58.183 --> 00:59.594
Laurel Lance.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.514
- Ollie.
- Yeah.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.316
Jean here has some good news for you.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.565
I'm only used to good news
if it's accompanied by bad news.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.193
Well, this news is unequivocal, Oliver.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.608
I can get the case
against you dismissed.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.651
Uh...

01:18.996 --> 01:20.988
Have a seat. Tell me more.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.453
I pored over the discovery documents
produced by the district attorney.

01:24.876 --> 01:28.085
Apparently, the FBI leveraged
Rene Ramirez

01:28.171 --> 01:29.161
to testify against you

01:29.256 --> 01:32.124
based on surveillance that was leaked
by a known criminal.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.253
Cayden James.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.959
JEAN: "Fruit of the poisonous tree."

01:35.262 --> 01:36.969
It's a legal metaphor positing that

01:37.055 --> 01:38.717
if the source of the evidence
is tainted,

01:38.807 --> 01:40.139
the evidence itself is tainted.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.179
Mr. James' actions
were not only illegal,

01:43.270 --> 01:44.636
but his death makes it impossible

01:44.730 --> 01:46.722
to corroborate the evidence
against Mr. Ramirez.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.148
So, if there's no case against Rene,
there's no case against me.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.691
We're going before Judge McGarvey

01:50.777 --> 01:52.609
on my motion
to dismiss this afternoon.

01:52.696 --> 01:53.903
Jean, you sure?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.360
You can just make this go away?

01:56.450 --> 01:58.157
Ollie, she's positive.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.489
Okay, I know you're not used
to getting good news,

02:00.579 --> 02:02.616
but this is what it sounds like.

02:06.877 --> 02:10.041
Mr. Mayor, we got an emergency
at SCPD.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.337
Like I said, it was accompanied
by some bad news.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.756
Jean, this is wonderful.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.174
I will see you at the courthouse
this afternoon.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.250
Okay.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.544
So?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.596
Laurel just walked into
police headquarters.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.423
- What, to surrender?
- Not exactly.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.300
She told them she's Laurel Lance.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.428
Our Laurel Lance.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.057
Okay, why is she claiming
to be Laurel Lance?

02:31.151 --> 02:34.064
Well, Dinah is out for blood
and Laurel Lance, public figure,

02:34.154 --> 02:37.363
is a much more difficult target
than Black Siren.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.235
Except it's a lie.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.068
It's all one big lie.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.620
Well, we need to get to her
before she gets to the press.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.492
I woke up in a cell

02:47.542 --> 02:49.454
and I managed to break down the door,

02:49.628 --> 02:51.585
and I just... I ran.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.083
They held you for two years?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.539
I don't remember.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.000
<i>They kept me drugged.</i>

02:57.094 --> 02:59.928
REPORTER 1: <i>The Black Canary was
reported dead, killed in a prison riot.</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:01.504
<i>Damien Darhk, he stabbed me.</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:03.298
<i>And then next thing I knew, I was...</i>

03:04.559 --> 03:05.549
<i>I was in that cell.</i>

03:05.644 --> 03:07.601
I don't know how,
but this is really, really bad.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.099
Rather, we should have
seen this coming.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.179
Should've known
that she'd eventually

03:10.273 --> 03:11.559
try to pull something like this.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.107
Why would Damien Darhk
do this to you?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.434
REPORTER 2: <i>Why would
he fake your death?</i>

03:14.528 --> 03:16.895
I don't know why
he would wanna fake my death.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.398
Maybe... Maybe to torture
the Green Arrow?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.654
So you know who the Green Arrow is?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.736
Ollie! Ollie!

03:26.915 --> 03:28.907
I never thought I'd see you again.

03:32.879 --> 03:33.869
Daddy.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.122
Daddy.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.839
- Daddy.
- REPORTER 1: Can you tell us any more

03:37.926 --> 03:39.087
information on...

03:39.469 --> 03:40.710
REPORTER 2: You notably
outed Miss. Lance

03:40.804 --> 03:42.420
as the Black Canary at her funeral.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.880
And now it seems
a little suspicious

03:43.974 --> 03:46.341
in light of the recent allegations
that you are the Green Arrow.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.183
It doesn't and it's not.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.979
I have made no secret of the fact
that when necessary,

03:52.065 --> 03:55.558
I have been in contact
with Green Arrow and his team.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.936
He told me about Laurel Lance.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.315
I wasn't talking to myself.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.567
Is that true, Miss Lance?

04:00.657 --> 04:01.864
REPORTER 3: Miss Lance, is Oliver Queen
the Green Arrow?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.656
I really do think that Miss Lance

04:10.125 --> 04:12.492
could use some time with her family
and some privacy.

04:13.003 --> 04:13.993
Let's go.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.086
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

04:27.642 --> 04:28.632
(CLICKS)

04:30.562 --> 04:32.599
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

04:32.689 --> 04:34.726
You said you wanted me
to be more like Laurel,

04:34.816 --> 04:35.977
so I thought I'd give it a try.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.024
Oh, I really wish I'd believe that.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.023
Where's the money
you stole from the city?

04:40.739 --> 04:41.729
Yeah...

04:41.948 --> 04:43.780
About that, slight hiccup.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.359
So, I went to where I stashed it,

04:46.745 --> 04:48.236
and it's been cleaned out.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.492
It's gone. Poof.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.073
So, without the money you, what,

04:52.209 --> 04:54.166
decided to become Laurel Lance,

04:54.252 --> 04:56.915
'cause she's a public figure
and harder to kill?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.666
You're really that afraid
of Dinah Drake, aren't you?

05:00.759 --> 05:02.125
Not just afraid of Dinah.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.382
Afraid of whoever manipulated
Cayden James

05:05.472 --> 05:06.758
into thinking I killed his son.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.181
'Cause that's probably
who killed James, too.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.426
Who did it? Anatoly?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.635
Or Diaz?

05:13.021 --> 05:14.011
THEA: Or you?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.727
I mean, she could've
just easily killed both of them.

05:17.901 --> 05:21.315
I don't exactly have
an airtight alibi for Cayden.

05:21.404 --> 05:25.114
I believe his son was killed
when I was incarcerated at A.R.G.U.S.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.399
OLIVER: Who did it?

05:26.868 --> 05:29.656
Anatoly or Diaz?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.658
Talking out of school
will get me in trouble.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.708
Look, whoever went after James
is clearly coming for you next.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.584
So, why don't you cooperate with us?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.124
Help us find the money,

05:39.381 --> 05:40.917
and maybe we can just protect you.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.794
Little trivia.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.637
There's a Thea Queen on the Earth
that I come from, too.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.215
Only she's not
as pathetically naive as you.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.425
Look.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.187
This is a lot simpler
than you're making it.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.144
You're gonna protect me
and you're going to help protect me

05:59.234 --> 06:03.353
by going along with the story
that I'm the real Laurel Lance.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.436
Yeah?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.114
Why would we do that?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.441
I don't know.

06:08.535 --> 06:12.449
Maybe because of all the reporters
that are just in the next room.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.164
You know, it's only a matter of time
before they ask me

06:16.167 --> 06:18.033
who the Green Arrow is again.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.836
What would you like me to tell them?

06:23.842 --> 06:25.174
We're done here.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.806
Mr. Mayor, may I speak to you
for a minute?

06:35.979 --> 06:36.969
Yes.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.851
- What's all the fuss?
- Laurel Lance just turned up alive.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.357
- Believe it or not, she's actually...
- I know who she is.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.277
Sorry to pull you away,
but payday is Friday.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.233
And my officers
aren't gonna get their checks.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.444
Captain Hill, I'm still working

06:52.537 --> 06:53.903
on recovering the money
that was extorted.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.535
And I have an idea to buy us time
that I wanted to run past you.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.661
Let's hear it.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.084
The department has
years of seized assets.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.661
Sports cars, mansions,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.667
even a stuffed polar bear,
if you can believe it.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.006
- Mmm-hmm.
- At least two-thirds of the property

07:06.092 --> 07:07.833
has cleared the court process
for sale.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.342
If we auction it off,
we can raise as much as $30 million.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.421
Thirty?

07:13.642 --> 07:15.178
Set that in motion.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.301
Thank you.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.268
- Hello.
- Don't talk to me.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.645
Captain Hill,
can I talk to you for a minute?

07:23.735 --> 07:25.852
- It's about Laurel Lance.
- That's a hell of a thing, isn't it?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.153
She said they faked her death

07:27.238 --> 07:29.321
and then she was
held captive for two years.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.943
Yeah, sure is.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.984
Anyone catch that case yet?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.489
You want it? It's yours.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.033
But right now she's going
to the hospital for a GSW.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.322
I'm patient.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.124
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

07:46.341 --> 07:48.549
- C-Dog.
- Hey, Zoe.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.218
Great. Love that that name's
sticking around. That's amazing.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.259
The babysitter had to go home
two hours ago.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.422
Where's my dad?

07:56.142 --> 07:57.223
Have a seat.

07:59.854 --> 08:00.890
Something happened.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.855
He's gonna be okay,

08:03.191 --> 08:04.648
but I need to tell you about it.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.270
This is inappropriate.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.731
My motion should be heard
in open court.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.316
I requested to be heard in chambers.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.034
Oh, to what, hide the embarrassment
of having your case dismissed?

08:16.121 --> 08:18.534
Actually we're taking Mr. Ramirez
off our witness list.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.491
Considering he was your sole witness
against Mr. Queen,

08:21.584 --> 08:24.122
- I renew my motion to have...
- He's not our sole witness.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.755
What? No, no, no, no.
Discovery on this case is closed.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.298
This is newly discovered information,
Your Honor.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.592
We'll make the witness' proffer
available to the defense,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.010
in accordance with <i>Brady v. Marilyn.</i>

08:33.096 --> 08:34.212
Who is the witness?

08:34.304 --> 08:36.342
Someone with enemies
on both sides of the law.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.140
That's why we're doing this
in chambers

08:38.393 --> 08:40.350
and why I granted
the district attorney's request

08:40.437 --> 08:41.472
for a suppression order.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.852
All right, I get it, it's sensitive.
What is the witness' name?

08:45.942 --> 08:46.932
Roy Harper.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.026
How did they even find Roy?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.486
I mean, we didn't know where he was.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.037
We didn't even know
what name he was working under.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.409
I didn't think anybody did.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.953
- Did you?
- No. No...

09:04.044 --> 09:06.661
God, I couldn't even find him
for your guys' wedding reception.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.542
It doesn't matter how they did it.
They did.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.917
Now we have to figure out
what to do next.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.715
He's definitely not
cooperating voluntarily.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.921
Well, it's been two years.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.718
I mean, there might be some
pressure points we don't know about,

09:14.804 --> 09:16.215
some people he cares about, some...

09:17.640 --> 09:19.222
- It's been a long time.
- OLIVER: Either way,

09:19.309 --> 09:21.471
we need to know
what Roy is going to say in court,

09:21.561 --> 09:24.304
which means we need to know
where he is right now.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.558
Oliver, he's a state witness.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.723
I know our whole thing is extralegal,

09:27.817 --> 09:29.979
but maybe we should let
your lawyer deal with this.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.608
The DA's office does not have
the capabilities of finding Roy.

09:32.697 --> 09:36.065
Which means,
this was either Diaz or Anatoly.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.650
You think whoever's
pulling the strings on this

09:37.744 --> 09:38.734
is still tugging them?

09:38.828 --> 09:40.990
Well, if you're in the mood
for some witness tampering,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.038
I think I have a line
on where the DA is holding Roy.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.457
They rented out several rooms in
the top floor of a hotel downtown.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.830
Hotel. Easily guarded position
with lots of civilians,

09:47.921 --> 09:50.834
we break in, get spotted, Oliver,
we make their case for them.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.713
Guys, if Ollie is right, and Roy
is in trouble with Diaz or Anatoly,

09:54.803 --> 09:56.669
we need to be protecting him.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.510
So we wait until dark to do recon.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.934
And then find
possible points of entry.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.397
No exertion or sudden movements.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.849
Don't wanna risk reopening the wound.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.935
(QUENTIN CLEARING THROAT)

10:13.029 --> 10:15.442
Hey, could you...
Could you give us a minute please?

10:17.534 --> 10:18.524
(SIGHS)

10:18.701 --> 10:20.818
What, is Mom coming
to visit or something?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.324
(SIGHING) Okay, firstly,
she's not your mom.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.659
And second, no.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.866
I called her right after your
little performance for the cameras

10:26.960 --> 10:28.952
and told her to hold off a bit
while I checked you out.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.287
That poor woman has been burned
enough by this sort of thing.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.048
More of Laurel's stuff.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.839
You know, I was just getting used
to the last outfit.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.386
Well, Forensics has that one.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.556
Anyway, you wanna pass
for the real Laurel,

10:42.851 --> 10:44.433
you better get used to her style.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.886
You call this "style"?

10:47.564 --> 10:50.523
Look, are you here just to make sure
my health insurance is up to date

10:50.608 --> 10:52.349
or are you here
to protect me from her?

10:56.239 --> 10:57.400
Just get dressed.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.320
Hey.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.625
Laurel Lance,
she died in this hospital.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.747
I pronounced her.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.119
There was an autopsy.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.963
Of course, I've seen
my share of things

11:15.049 --> 11:17.211
I once would've
considered miraculous.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.795
I mean, in a world where a man
can run faster than light,

11:20.889 --> 11:22.425
I suppose anything's possible.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.097
That's why I need
to rule out the chance

11:24.184 --> 11:25.595
that this person
could be an impostor.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.142
The DNA test will tell us that.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.012
Excuse me.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.185
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.069
Look, I know what you're
doing here, all right?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.021
You're going after Laurel 'cause
of what happened to your friend,

11:39.115 --> 11:40.196
and I get that, okay?

11:40.283 --> 11:43.401
It's what I would do
if someone I love was dead.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.577
You mean it's just what you do
with a criminal, Quentin,

11:45.663 --> 11:47.199
which, by the way, is what she is.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.952
Yeah, but you and I both know that,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.910
but, you know, she's turned herself
into a beloved public figure.

11:52.670 --> 11:56.710
She's also said that she's got
no compunctions about outing Oliver.

11:58.593 --> 11:59.834
I don't think
she'll stop with him.

11:59.928 --> 12:03.046
- So you're doing this for my sake?
- For all of our sakes.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.431
I've been making progress
with her, Dinah.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.266
Okay? I'm not finished.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.472
But if she lives as my Laurel...

12:09.562 --> 12:12.100
She's not your Laurel.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.854
Your Laurel wouldn't have murdered
Vince or anyone else.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.191
She did.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.021
And you are delusional
if you think you can change her.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.107
No. I'm telling you,
I've been changing her, okay?

12:23.201 --> 12:26.569
All I'm asking for you
is just a chance. Please?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.781
What's taking her so long?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.711
- Where'd she go?
- The police officer took her.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.417
Said something about a safe house.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.468
No, no. I am the lead detective
on this case.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.056
- You did this.
- What are you talking about?

12:52.146 --> 12:53.887
I wanna know where she is, too,
you know.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.182
(SIGHS)

13:02.615 --> 13:03.981
Is my father not coming?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.408
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Mr. Diaz.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.364
(CAR STARTING)

13:21.467 --> 13:23.629
I'm guessing Roy's in the room
with the police outside?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.972
Yeah. Eating the wrong end
of a phone book.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.716
(SIGHS) It's risky terrain.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.392
You just told me
he's getting beaten on.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.511
You're still not sure
we should do this?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.305
Two-man team on the balcony.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.390
JOHN: If we can get past them,
that's our best bet.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.816
John, he's in there 'cause of me.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.727
He's been on the run for three years.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.028
Oliver, that's his choice.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.614
I know that,
but did I learn anything from it?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.324
Roy put on the hood.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.657
He sacrificed himself for me.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.405
And I asked you to do the same thing,

13:52.498 --> 13:55.206
at the expense of your safety
and your family.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.956
Difference was,
I wanted to put on the hood.

13:58.046 --> 14:01.539
Oliver, listen, I've been good
for the past two months, good.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.173
But instead of
giving me back the hood,

14:03.259 --> 14:04.716
you've had Cisco make me a new suit.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.885
There it is.
It's a 15-second opening.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.091
That is our window.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.152
We got it from here.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.571
Head back to SCPD
before you're missed.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.277
Laurel.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.904
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

14:30.161 --> 14:32.995
Is it Laurel or "Laurel" these days?

14:33.247 --> 14:35.455
So confusing,
this doppelganger business.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.666
But you seem
to have figured it out.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.209
Diaz killed Cayden.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.745
He told me.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.171
No honor among thieves.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.957
Or crime lords, I guess.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.754
Well...

14:47.178 --> 14:50.171
Diaz manipulated the both of us,
lied to the both of us.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.971
This whole time,
he's had his own agenda.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.048
That doesn't bother you?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.679
I'm not sentimental.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.681
I am Russian.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.351
I'm in the city for two reasons only.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.981
One is revenge against Oliver Queen,

15:04.195 --> 15:05.902
and two is money.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.065
I'm happy to work
with whoever can get me either.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.991
You're in the city
because the Bratva cast you out.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.444
Well, there's that, too.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.333
There is a 15-second window

15:20.420 --> 15:22.252
where neither roof guard
is watching the HVAC vent.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.328
We can get in that way.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.210
All right, well, did you see him,
is he okay?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.880
- We can get him out.
- I know. And I'm coming with you.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.257
I thought you didn't do this anymore.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.468
Ollie, it's Roy.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.140
Right, but, Thea,
you shouldn't do this.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.517
And I understand it's hypocritical
pointing out

15:37.603 --> 15:39.560
that you have a personal involvement.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.808
Doesn't make me wrong.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.684
More importantly,
you have not been field-ready

15:44.777 --> 15:46.063
since you got out of your coma.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.941
I'll be fine. Okay?

15:48.322 --> 15:49.938
And did you guys
even measure the vents?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.193
Because you should be asking

15:51.284 --> 15:52.946
if I'm the right size
to fit through them.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.276
Don't think either of you two can.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.452
Where are you guys keeping my suit?

15:59.834 --> 16:00.824
You okay?

16:00.918 --> 16:02.409
It's just like riding a bike.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.244
It really isn't.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.663
I can buy you a few extra seconds.

16:07.717 --> 16:08.707
I'm ready.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.083
All right.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.507
What's that for?

16:17.768 --> 16:19.430
There's not a home game tonight,
is there?

16:42.752 --> 16:43.742
(GRUNTS)

16:44.378 --> 16:45.368
OFFICER: You wanna keep going,

16:45.463 --> 16:47.295
or are you gonna testify?

16:48.424 --> 16:49.665
I'm not a lawyer,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.716
but I'm pretty sure
torturing your witness

16:51.802 --> 16:53.213
isn't gonna be great for your case.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.554
You don't think we know how to
put you in a world of hurt

16:57.099 --> 16:58.340
without leaving a mark?

17:03.064 --> 17:04.054
No.

17:04.898 --> 17:05.888
(GROANING)

17:12.740 --> 17:14.196
Are you getting this?

17:14.575 --> 17:16.406
I'm enhancing their badge numbers.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.984
And just when you thought
Oliver took down

17:18.079 --> 17:19.319
all the crooked cops last year.

17:19.914 --> 17:20.904
I'm going in.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.785
FELICITY: <i>I wouldn't.
They got six more guys in the hall.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:23.911
Stand down.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.867
I know it's hard,
but you have to wait.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.247
(GROANING)

17:31.300 --> 17:32.711
I'm working up an appetite here.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.168
Hey.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.345
We're gonna get some
Big Belly Burger.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.010
You decide to play nice,
I might give you the fries.

17:54.657 --> 17:55.647
Is that my hood?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.066
It looks good on you.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.998
I'm sorry if you're seeing someone.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.579
I'm not. I didn't take your advice.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.836
No kids, no wife,
and I really, really hate minivans.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.297
How did they find you?

18:17.388 --> 18:19.471
I was in St. Roch

18:19.557 --> 18:21.423
and the Star City cops,
they tased me,

18:21.517 --> 18:22.803
and they threw me
in the back of a van.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.763
They knew everything,
they knew about Oliver,

18:24.854 --> 18:27.016
they knew about me faking my death,
they knew it all.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.597
SCPD SWAT incoming.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.107
Speedy, you wanna
get out of there now.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.354
Speedy, move.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.154
Okay, we're leaving.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.815
No, you're leaving.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.524
I'm in no shape to be swinging
from the rooftops.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.235
I'm not leaving without you.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.745
- They're coming in hot.
- You gotta go right now.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.289
Damn it, Speedy, get out of there!

18:46.375 --> 18:47.365
I'm getting you out of here.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.918
- No, you can't. You have to go.
- No.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.168
I'm not leaving you.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.837
GREEN ARROW: <i>Speedy, they're right
outside the door!</i>

18:53.716 --> 18:56.049
I'm not losing you again.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.335
Just go sit.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.590
Thea.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.807
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

19:12.026 --> 19:13.016
I needed some air.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.185
You're gonna need air.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.399
- What the hell did you just do?
- I just saved your life.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.110
There's too many of them in there.
They would have killed you both.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.486
Look...

19:25.414 --> 19:27.326
We will get Roy back.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.040
I am promising you,

19:29.460 --> 19:30.826
we will get him back.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.470
They're really
circling the wagons now.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.092
They've upped security tenfold.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.469
He was bleeding internally,

19:45.559 --> 19:47.642
so if we don't get to him soon,
they're going to kill him.

19:47.728 --> 19:51.017
They will not, because they need him
alive to testify against me.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.598
Not "they." Diaz.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.308
I pulled financials
on both the police officers

19:54.402 --> 19:55.392
that were torturing Roy.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.443
They both receive generous
dividend payments

19:57.530 --> 19:59.863
from stocks of a Corto Maltese-based
shell corporation.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.656
They financed the company
that was manufacturing

20:01.742 --> 20:03.404
the drug I used to treat my injury.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.944
Ricardo Diaz's company.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.995
Both officers were on duty
when Cayden James was killed,

20:08.082 --> 20:09.323
and all the officers
that were there tonight,

20:09.417 --> 20:11.124
we have reason to believe
they're working with Diaz, too.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.959
So Diaz has been playing us
since the beginning.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.833
Or he's just been playing you.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.258
She's upset. She's worried about Roy.

20:23.681 --> 20:24.671
Yeah, so am I.

20:28.686 --> 20:31.599
- I had to pull you out of there.
- No, you could've come in.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.351
I come in there, and it's you and me

20:33.441 --> 20:35.603
against a SWAT team,
in a tight space,

20:35.693 --> 20:37.150
nobody comes out of there.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.856
Especially not Roy.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.439
You know, there are times

20:43.784 --> 20:48.074
when I feel like my life
completely fell apart when Roy left.

20:48.289 --> 20:52.499
From my bloodlust, to Malcolm,
to the coma...

20:53.794 --> 20:57.378
Knowing he was out there,
that he was okay,

20:58.174 --> 21:00.587
it made my life
just a little bit easier.

21:01.469 --> 21:04.428
Ever since Mom died,
I haven't known much of anything

21:04.513 --> 21:07.426
other than the fact
that I want to make sure he is safe.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.224
And I will do whatever it takes
to make sure that happens.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.722
We all will, Speedy.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.182
JOHN: Felicity may have just
found something.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.186
SCPD just requisitioned
a transport prisoner van.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.858
They're moving Roy
to a new safe house.

21:18.944 --> 21:19.934
We just don't know when.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.065
That's it.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.317
That's when we get him.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.899
There's something else.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.489
DINAH DRAKE: No, no, no, no, okay.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.662
You know what, who can tell me
where Laurel Lance is?

21:30.748 --> 21:31.738
Can you tell me that?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.249
And when will he be available?

21:35.920 --> 21:38.003
No, no, no, no. No, thank you.
I'll call back.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.580
I swear, this isn't me, okay?

21:41.175 --> 21:42.416
I need to speak with you.

21:43.677 --> 21:44.793
You too.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.851
Turn the cameras off.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.850
(CLICKS)

22:03.489 --> 22:06.106
Cayden James was murdered
right there.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.991
By Ricardo Diaz.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.946
- Oh, my God.
- And it was covered up by the SCPD.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.328
I thought Cayden James
was killed by another inmate

22:15.417 --> 22:17.079
when he was transferred
to Iron Heights.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.876
Felicity found out
what actually happened.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.291
Never made it to Iron Heights.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.462
The cops on duty
are on Diaz's payroll.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.338
They faked the transfer.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.509
Doing that would take...

22:27.596 --> 22:30.680
A systemic breach
of the police department.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.883
Worse than last year's corruption.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.468
I didn't think
that was even possible.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.723
Neither did I.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.355
Dinah, I know that
you don't believe in me right now,

22:39.441 --> 22:41.649
and I know the two of you
don't trust each other,

22:41.735 --> 22:42.725
for good reason,

22:43.279 --> 22:46.488
but the both of you
believe in the badge.

22:47.157 --> 22:50.321
I need you working together,
I need to know how deep this goes.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.995
I need to know who in that room
we can trust.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.910
Which means you gotta
put your vendetta on hold.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.415
Okay.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.167
We can work it out at my place.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.623
The walls here have got ears.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.550
And this is why
I couldn't find Laurel.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.381
'Cause those bent cops sprung her.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.212
Or they took her someplace worse.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.764
Diaz's feelings were so hurt
when you tried to run.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.805
It's as if you don't trust him
or something.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.936
I'm still trying to figure out
why you do.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.359
For me, it's more a matter
of money than trust.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.395
Either way, Diaz better.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.444
Why blow up city
when you can control it, yes?

23:29.575 --> 23:30.565
(GRUNTING)

24:00.064 --> 24:01.726
You're as good as they said you were.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.609
Do you know
that fighting for trophies

24:07.821 --> 24:09.778
is not the same
as fighting for your life?

24:11.283 --> 24:12.990
Break you of your bad habits.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.863
Welcome to the team.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.868
That's a lot of money
for a man with bad foot.

24:23.087 --> 24:27.001
I didn't break it,
I just had to break him.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.596
Building a family, Anatoly.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.799
Family.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.474
Isn't that what "Bratva" means?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.429
- "Brotherhood"?
<i>- Da.</i>

24:45.275 --> 24:46.732
See, family,

24:47.778 --> 24:49.189
they rely on one another.

24:49.655 --> 24:52.443
Family trust each other.

24:52.866 --> 24:57.702
See, when a family does well,
each member prospers.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.580
But if just one person

25:02.126 --> 25:04.584
betrays their family...

25:08.340 --> 25:09.751
Give us the room!

25:09.925 --> 25:10.915
Move!

25:12.511 --> 25:13.501
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

25:17.850 --> 25:20.513
The money that you stole from Cayden

25:22.604 --> 25:24.436
was also my money.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.474
I earned it, just like you.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.977
Except I didn't take
more than my share.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.941
Well, you've got it all back,
obviously.

25:32.406 --> 25:33.442
So why am I here?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.615
It's 'cause our business
is not concluded.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.535
You might have convinced Anatoly that
you're worth staying in bed with,

25:38.620 --> 25:41.112
but I have a psycho vigilante
coming after me.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.538
Dinah Drake.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.615
Mmm?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.038
I see it all.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.879
I know it all. I control it all.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.211
I've been working on this for months.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.636
See, Cayden, he's just a small piece
of a much larger puzzle.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.840
And so are you.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.424
I just wanna
get the hell out of this city.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.759
Where you wanna go?

26:03.979 --> 26:04.969
Hmm?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.771
- Do what?
- Live.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.601
Without always having to look
over my shoulder.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.318
I don't want you
to worry about Dinah Drake.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.484
I don't want you
to worry about Oliver Queen

26:19.953 --> 26:21.319
or any of those chumps

26:21.789 --> 26:24.406
who can't see two inches
past their face.

26:25.042 --> 26:29.252
Anatoly said that you had a plan
to take control of the city.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.584
Now, isn't that something...

26:36.428 --> 26:37.839
Worth staying in bed for?

26:43.685 --> 26:44.971
I don't know, Felicity.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.473
Maybe it's a little soon, bringing up
taking back the mantle from Oliver,

26:49.566 --> 26:50.727
but it's been two months.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.400
A hell of a two months, though.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.394
And Oliver's not just ready
to step down,

26:54.488 --> 26:56.445
not with everything that's going on.
It's too much.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.439
It's crazy what's...

26:59.952 --> 27:01.318
They're moving Roy in 10 minutes.

27:09.795 --> 27:10.785
(TIRES SCREECHING)

27:14.133 --> 27:15.123
Don't move.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.005
Roy, back away from the door.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.097
It's a decoy.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.846
They faked Cayden James' transfer,
they faked this one, too.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.515
So where is Roy?

27:35.529 --> 27:38.488
Mr. Harper. Good to meet you.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.283
You said they were moving him.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.959
Yeah, they must have put Roy
into a different vehicle

27:52.045 --> 27:53.786
when they were in the underground
and I didn't have eyes on them.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.130
Which means he could have been
picked up at any point last night.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.752
How many cars left the hotel
in that time frame?

27:57.843 --> 27:58.959
Nearly 300.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.544
I'm tracking license-plate numbers,
but it's gonna take some time.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.221
If it takes more than an hour,
I'm gonna start breaking fingers.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.216
There's that Queen temper.

28:06.310 --> 28:09.269
I'll contact Lyla, see if A.R.G.U.S.
can help with finding Roy.

28:13.734 --> 28:14.975
How are you holding up?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.060
- I've been better.
- Yeah, I know.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.441
It's because you're blaming yourself
for Roy's situation

28:19.531 --> 28:21.773
instead of accurately blaming
Ricardo Diaz.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.779
Well, Roy wouldn't be
in this situation

28:23.869 --> 28:26.407
if he didn't fall on his sword
for me three years ago.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.158
That was his choice, Oliver.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.661
And I believed then and
I still believe it was the right one.

28:30.876 --> 28:34.040
I'm worried that I didn't
rescue him from that hotel room

28:34.129 --> 28:35.245
'cause I wouldn't have been able

28:35.339 --> 28:37.205
to bear the responsibility
if things went bad.

28:37.591 --> 28:38.957
You didn't go into that hotel room

28:39.051 --> 28:41.759
because your gut told you
things would go bad.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.386
And that gut's kept you alive
for 11 years

28:43.472 --> 28:44.804
and it kept Roy alive last night.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.756
Maybe. How do I know?

28:46.850 --> 28:49.388
I could ask Cisco
to find a parallel universe

28:49.478 --> 28:50.468
in which you did.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.269
But in the meantime
if you could just stop

28:52.356 --> 28:56.270
finding ways to blame yourself,
that would be so great.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.236
- Is that what I'm doing?
- That's what you're always doing.

29:00.697 --> 29:01.813
Maybe you have a point.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.774
Last night, John basically asked me

29:04.868 --> 29:06.860
why I haven't given him
the hood back.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.156
Yeah, I know, he told me.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.409
I told him you probably just thought
it wasn't the right time.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.081
Am I on the money?

29:13.335 --> 29:14.451
I don't know.

29:19.174 --> 29:22.258
You have a strength
one doesn't see much.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.881
You wanna join my team?

29:27.975 --> 29:29.307
Sure.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.095
Do you offer medical and dental?

29:33.021 --> 29:36.185
You know, my police friends are
telling me you're not cooperating.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.979
You're not playing ball.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.276
You won't testify against Queen?

29:41.363 --> 29:43.070
If you actually think
that I would do that,

29:43.573 --> 29:44.609
then you're an idiot.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.108
(CHUCKLES) One of us is.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.741
See, but I'm not the type of guy
that believes giving a beating

29:53.583 --> 29:54.994
is the only way

29:55.711 --> 29:56.952
to cause some pain.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.382
How's Speedy?

30:06.054 --> 30:07.966
She came out of retirement.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.968
Why would she do that?

30:10.851 --> 30:14.265
Why the hell would Queen
let his baby sister

30:15.188 --> 30:16.850
dress up like Will Scarlet?

30:18.358 --> 30:19.769
All right, I gotta ask.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.564
That's a moot point.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.316
You see, the real question is,

30:32.539 --> 30:34.747
who do I gotta bring the pain to?

30:36.418 --> 30:38.000
Do I gotta bring it to you?

30:41.465 --> 30:42.876
Or her?

30:50.932 --> 30:53.015
Shift sergeant was definitely
in on it. Look at this.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.177
(SIGHS) Diaz has got
his fingers in deep.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.179
Listen.

30:58.648 --> 30:59.980
Thanks for doing this, all right?

31:00.525 --> 31:02.687
- Backing off Laurel.
- It's temporary.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.895
Until we can get the department
back under control.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.146
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

31:11.661 --> 31:12.651
Hi, Daddy.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.995
- Hi.
- Speak of the devil.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.873
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.162
I've got a lot I'd like to say.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.414
Can we not do the whole
screaming thing,

31:21.505 --> 31:22.712
because the only thing
that's gonna happen

31:22.798 --> 31:24.755
is my father's gonna have to
renovate his apartment.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.047
Plus,

31:26.301 --> 31:27.633
I'm here about Ricardo Diaz.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.553
I would ask how you're doing, but...

31:37.020 --> 31:39.854
Felicity and A.R.G.U.S.
are working on locating Roy.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.768
You know, it's been a while
since I offered you

31:45.862 --> 31:47.694
a little big-brother advice.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.405
Do you mind?

31:53.203 --> 31:54.535
This should be good.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.160
When we find Roy... Not if, but when

31:59.418 --> 32:00.750
we find Roy,

32:03.380 --> 32:05.087
I think maybe you should go with him.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.380
- Where?
- Wherever he's going.

32:11.054 --> 32:15.264
I mean, Thea, I'd miss you like crazy

32:16.101 --> 32:18.764
but you said that you haven't
been the same without him.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.350
So maybe you shouldn't be
without him.

32:22.107 --> 32:25.566
- You really think I should go?
- I don't want you to go, obviously.

32:26.027 --> 32:31.273
But you've seen what... What having
Felicity in my life has done for me.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.988
You deserve that same
kind of happiness, Speedy.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.532
Wherever it is.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.205
JOHN: Got news.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.203
- Location on Roy?
- Laurel.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.287
She showed up at Lance's apartment
with intel on Ricardo Diaz.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.547
He has some plan
to take over the city,

32:56.641 --> 32:59.258
whatever that means.
I don't exactly have details.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.561
No, he just let you leave
after you stole all that money.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.474
Let you come over here
and tell us all of this.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.981
Well, I'm rather charming.
Don't you think?

33:09.446 --> 33:10.687
So where's Roy?

33:12.073 --> 33:14.190
They had him brought
to some rundown casino.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.401
I heard some guys talking about it
on my way out.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.158
- I can take you there.
- So Diaz can take these guys out?

33:19.539 --> 33:20.746
Is that part of the plan?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.698
Look, we really don't
have a choice, okay?

33:22.792 --> 33:24.078
We need to take this chance.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.660
All right, why are you doing this?

33:26.046 --> 33:27.378
Going against Diaz?

33:27.464 --> 33:31.083
Because it occurred to me
that if I'm gonna be Laurel,

33:31.593 --> 33:33.550
I should probably
start acting like it.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.087
(SIGHS)

33:41.269 --> 33:43.682
Yeah, John.
We have a location on Roy.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.058
Let's get ready to move.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.689
All right, fine.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.941
- Just this once.
- No.

33:49.486 --> 33:52.069
You don't trust me.
I don't trust you.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.488
So I'd rather
be in the field shorthanded.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.087
Only two guards.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.043
Diaz clearly wasn't expecting us.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.543
Black Siren didn't warn him.

34:13.717 --> 34:14.833
- Let's go.
- Wait.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.965
If we go in there without
knowing our primary objective,

34:17.054 --> 34:18.091
no one is coming out.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.092
Our primary objective is to get Roy.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.674
What about Diaz? He's in there, too.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.101
And we just found out that he's
the one that's behind everything bad

34:24.187 --> 34:26.520
that's been happening in the city
for the past six months.

34:27.524 --> 34:28.981
So let's get 'em both.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.820
- Overwatch, you in yet?
- FELICITY: <i>Uplinking now.</i>

34:34.906 --> 34:36.693
<i>Huffing and puffing and blowing
all those firewalls down,</i>

34:36.783 --> 34:37.773
<i>but before I finish,</i>

34:37.867 --> 34:40.405
if he's a smart guy,
and we know that he is,

34:40.495 --> 34:42.487
this will definitely tip him off
that you're there.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.447
- We need to know where Roy is.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

34:44.623 --> 34:46.081
I pulled the blueprints of the casino
from the city.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.157
I'll guide you through.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.538
<i>Head up the escalator.</i>

34:52.465 --> 34:56.175
Three vigilantes, including your
red girlfriend just showed up.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.048
It's time for a change of scenery.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.424
You know what to do.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.140
Four hostiles with full autos
right in front of you.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.494
- Which way?
- According to thermals,

35:31.588 --> 35:34.080
Diaz has Roy
through the door on the north wall.

35:38.178 --> 35:41.421
Unit 545 requesting backup.
Shots fired.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.055
Arrows.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.841
Make that, "Arrows fired."

35:45.769 --> 35:47.055
Get away from him!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.688
On the ground. Now!

35:54.319 --> 35:56.732
I love it when you visit me,
Mr. Mayor.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.692
I love it even more when you leave.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.112
No kill shots. I need him alive.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.502
Speedy! No!

36:14.005 --> 36:14.995
(GRUNTING)

36:33.316 --> 36:34.306
Ahh!

36:57.674 --> 36:58.664
We have a problem.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.125
One of Diaz's cops
alerted the legitimate cavalry.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.926
The SCPD is headed your way en masse.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.398
So you're just a hired hand?

37:23.658 --> 37:25.365
I used to be Pakhan.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.030
You cost me that.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.282
I've got him. Go help Speedy.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.371
Ugh!

37:40.925 --> 37:41.915
(GROANING)

37:43.970 --> 37:44.960
(SIRENS BLARING)

37:46.097 --> 37:47.178
You okay?

37:49.184 --> 37:50.174
Don't move.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.806
Not all those guys are on my payroll.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.428
Yet.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.601
But even the ones who aren't,

37:56.691 --> 38:01.186
they find the anti-vigilante bill
very motivating.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.394
Speedy.

38:02.697 --> 38:03.778
Get in the van

38:04.240 --> 38:05.902
and drive Roy away.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.109
- What about Diaz?
- I got Diaz.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.658
No, you don't.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.410
You know that, right?

38:14.709 --> 38:16.416
If you stay here,

38:16.836 --> 38:18.498
you're gonna get yourself a collar.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.419
And it's not like you can
just take me away with you, right?

38:22.801 --> 38:24.258
But you already knew that.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.669
That's why you let your sister
drive off.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.588
You made your choice.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.675
Freeze!

38:46.950 --> 38:48.157
How do you feel?

38:48.827 --> 38:51.194
Like I've been beaten within an inch
of my life with a telephone book.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.823
JOHN: Two broken ribs
and a bruised lung.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.405
Gotta take it easy
for a few days, Roy.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.411
Well, that's the good part
about being a fugitive.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.284
There's nowhere else I have to be.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.495
How's Anatoly?

39:01.840 --> 39:05.459
SCPD. I had to bail. What about Diaz?

39:05.927 --> 39:06.917
Same.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.548
How are Quentin and Dinah doing

39:08.638 --> 39:11.176
with their investigation
into the SCPD?

39:11.266 --> 39:12.256
They're working on it.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.762
I'm not a lawyer,
but what are the effects of us

39:14.853 --> 39:17.470
having the government's star witness
in our protection instead of theirs?

39:17.564 --> 39:19.226
OLIVER: Not as much as you would think.

39:19.524 --> 39:23.268
They'll add witness tampering
and obstruction to their

39:23.361 --> 39:24.897
very long list of charges.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.395
Cherry on top.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.819
We did it all for Thea.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.952
And for Roy.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.577
I would have done it
for any of you guys.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.881
(SIGHS) My father's asleep.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.671
I came to see you.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.599
Okay.

40:00.940 --> 40:01.930
(OLIVER SIGHS)

40:06.404 --> 40:07.485
You didn't set us up.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.655
Gee, Ollie, you sound surprised.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.949
So I came by to say thank you.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.113
And yet still unconvinced.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.739
You're not Laurel.

40:16.915 --> 40:17.996
Not our Laurel.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.783
And saying that you are
to a bunch of press...

40:21.753 --> 40:24.587
No. That does not make it so.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.673
You're right. I'm not.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.048
But I'm willing to try.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.722
And I can't make any promises.
I am who I am,

40:36.059 --> 40:39.678
but I'm willing to try if you're
willing to give me the space to.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.308
Well, that sounds fair.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.811
You're staying here?

40:45.902 --> 40:47.359
Quentin, he...

40:47.528 --> 40:49.736
My father offered me his couch.

40:50.865 --> 40:54.324
It's pretty on point with the whole
"rescue Laurel Lance" story, so...

40:54.410 --> 40:55.400
Yeah.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.154
I'll be checking in.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.995
Looking forward to it.

Home sweet home.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.092
Nice.

41:20.687 --> 41:23.304
For the past three years, I've been
sleeping with the cockroaches.

41:26.275 --> 41:29.109
I feel like
I should have been there with you.

41:29.404 --> 41:32.112
Is that too presumptuous
or confusing?

41:32.198 --> 41:33.905
I know that last time
we saw each other

41:33.992 --> 41:35.153
I said that
we should probably see...
