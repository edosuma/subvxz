00:28.069 --> 00:30.094
<i>Although each of the world's countries</i>

00:30.205 --> 00:31.433
<i>would like to dispute this fact,</i>

00:31.539 --> 00:32.972
<i>we French know the truth:</i>

00:33.074 --> 00:35.304
<i>The best food in the world</i>
<i>is made in France.</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:37.469
<i>The best food in France</i>
<i>is made in Paris.</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:42.073
<i>And the best food in Paris, some say,</i>
<i>is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.</i>

00:42.183 --> 00:44.549
<i>Gusteau's restaurant</i>
<i>is the toast of Paris,</i>

00:44.652 --> 00:46.279
<i>booked five months in advance.</i>

00:46.388 --> 00:49.118
<i>And his dazzling ascent</i>
<i>to the top of fine French cuisine</i>

00:49.224 --> 00:51.556
<i>has made his competitors envious.</i>

00:51.659 --> 00:54.958
<i>He is the youngest chef ever</i>
<i>to achieve a five-star rating.</i>

00:55.096 --> 00:57.223
<i>Chef Gusteau's cookbook,</i>
Anyone Can Cook!

00:57.332 --> 00:59.459
<i>Climbed to the top of the bestseller list.</i>

00:59.567 --> 01:01.865
<i>But not everyone</i>
<i>celebrates its success.</i>

01:01.970 --> 01:04.870
<i>Amusing title,</i> Anyone Can Cook!

01:04.973 --> 01:08.670
<i>What's even more amusing is that</i>
<i>Gusteau actually seems to believe it.</i>

01:08.777 --> 01:11.268
<i>I, on the other hand,</i>
<i>take cooking seriously.</i>

01:11.379 --> 01:15.145
<i>And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.</i>

01:53.421 --> 01:55.412
<i>This is me.</i>

01:55.790 --> 01:59.226
<i>I think it's apparent</i>
<i>I need to rethink my life a little bit.</i>

01:59.327 --> 02:00.919
<i>What's my problem?</i>

02:01.029 --> 02:02.963
<i>First of all, I'm a rat.</i>

02:05.033 --> 02:07.524
<i>Which means life is hard.</i>

02:08.770 --> 02:13.104
<i>And second, I have a highly developed</i>
<i>sense of taste and smell.</i>

02:14.542 --> 02:18.876
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

02:18.980 --> 02:21.141
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

02:21.249 --> 02:24.878
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

02:24.986 --> 02:28.422
<i>This is Emile, my brother.</i>
<i>He's easily impressed.</i>

02:28.523 --> 02:32.084
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

02:32.327 --> 02:35.262
<i>This is my dad. He's never impressed.</i>

02:35.697 --> 02:38.598
<i>He also happens to be</i>
<i>the leader of our clan.</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:42.166
<i>So, what's wrong</i>
<i>with having highly developed senses?</i>

02:42.270 --> 02:46.400
- Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

02:46.975 --> 02:50.411
<i>Turns out that funny smell</i>
<i>was rat poison.</i>

02:50.512 --> 02:53.879
<i>Suddenly, Dad didn't think</i>
<i>my talent was useless.</i>

02:53.982 --> 02:56.450
<i>I was feeling pretty good about my gift,</i>

02:56.551 --> 02:58.951
<i>until Dad gave me a job.</i>

02:59.387 --> 03:00.684
Clean.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.022
Clean.

03:02.157 --> 03:03.522
<i>That's right. Poison checker.</i>

03:03.625 --> 03:04.751
Cleanerific.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.360
Cleanerino.

03:06.828 --> 03:08.557
Close to godliness.

03:09.497 --> 03:13.797
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

03:14.035 --> 03:15.764
Never mind. Move on.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.372
<i>Well, it made my dad proud.</i>

03:18.473 --> 03:23.069
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

03:23.178 --> 03:25.738
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

03:25.847 --> 03:29.442
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

03:29.551 --> 03:31.542
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

03:31.653 --> 03:34.144
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

03:35.356 --> 03:37.221
<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>we have different points of view.</i>

03:38.326 --> 03:39.816
<i>This much I knew:</i>

03:39.928 --> 03:43.864
<i>If you are what you eat,</i>
<i>then I only want to eat the good stuff.</i>

03:44.032 --> 03:45.499
<i>But to my dad...</i>

03:45.600 --> 03:46.726
Food is fuel.

03:46.834 --> 03:50.463
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

03:50.572 --> 03:52.130
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.730
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

03:53.841 --> 03:55.706
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

03:55.810 --> 03:57.402
where nothing is poisoned?

03:57.512 --> 04:00.072
First of all, we are not thieves.

04:00.181 --> 04:03.048
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.345
It's dangerous.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.181
<i>I know</i>
<i>I'm supposed to hate humans,</i>

04:06.287 --> 04:08.312
<i>but there's something about them.</i>

04:08.423 --> 04:12.792
<i>They don't just survive.</i>
<i>They discover, they create.</i>

04:13.161 --> 04:15.322
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>just look at what they do with food.</i>

04:15.430 --> 04:16.920
<i>GUS TEAU ON TV:</i>
<i>How can I describe it?</i>

04:17.031 --> 04:20.990
<i>Good food is like music you can taste,</i>
<i>color you can smell.</i>

04:21.101 --> 04:23.570
<i>There is excellence all around you.</i>

04:23.671 --> 04:27.198
<i>You need only be aware to stop</i>
<i>and savor it.</i>

04:31.112 --> 04:33.307
<i>Oh, Gusteau was right.</i>

04:33.581 --> 04:36.141
<i>Oh, mmm, yeah.</i>

04:36.551 --> 04:38.143
<i>Oh, amazing.</i>

04:38.853 --> 04:42.016
<i>Each flavor was totally unique.</i>

04:46.094 --> 04:49.291
<i>But combine one flavor with another,</i>

04:49.397 --> 04:52.161
<i>and something new was created.</i>

04:57.872 --> 05:00.363
<i>So now I had a secret life.</i>

05:08.216 --> 05:10.776
<i>The only one who knew about it</i>
<i>was Emile.</i>

05:11.085 --> 05:13.280
Hey, Emile. Emile.

05:13.621 --> 05:15.612
I found a mushroom.

05:15.723 --> 05:19.056
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

05:19.494 --> 05:22.588
<i>He doesn't understand me,</i>
<i>but I can be myself around him.</i>

05:22.697 --> 05:24.426
Why are you walking like that?

05:24.532 --> 05:27.501
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

05:27.602 --> 05:29.661
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

05:29.771 --> 05:30.965
that we handle food with?

05:31.072 --> 05:33.131
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?

05:33.241 --> 05:34.299
All the time.

05:34.409 --> 05:36.969
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

05:37.078 --> 05:38.204
Well, go ahead.

05:38.313 --> 05:40.907
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.981
What have you got there?

05:46.754 --> 05:48.449
You found cheese?

05:48.956 --> 05:53.290
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chÃ¨vre de pays!

05:53.494 --> 05:55.985
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

05:56.097 --> 05:57.064
And...

05:59.300 --> 06:02.497
This rosemary! This rosemary

06:02.603 --> 06:06.266
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.733
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'll... You know...

06:09.844 --> 06:14.247
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

06:14.349 --> 06:15.976
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

06:16.084 --> 06:17.642
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

06:17.752 --> 06:18.776
Emile!

06:18.886 --> 06:20.786
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

06:20.888 --> 06:22.378
We got to cook this.

06:22.490 --> 06:26.950
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

06:28.229 --> 06:29.196
Yeah.

06:29.897 --> 06:32.161
The key is to keep turning it.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.667
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

06:36.904 --> 06:39.099
That storm's getting closer.

06:39.407 --> 06:44.106
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

06:55.957 --> 06:57.424
You got to taste this!

06:57.525 --> 07:01.825
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

07:01.929 --> 07:04.796
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

07:06.033 --> 07:09.935
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

07:10.037 --> 07:13.234
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

07:13.508 --> 07:17.968
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

07:18.079 --> 07:20.741
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

07:20.848 --> 07:24.284
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

07:24.385 --> 07:26.910
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

07:27.021 --> 07:28.955
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

07:35.897 --> 07:38.024
Saffron.
- Not good.

07:38.132 --> 07:39.599
Saffron.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.568
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.104
I've been down here a million times.

07:45.206 --> 07:48.369
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

07:48.476 --> 07:50.467
You've been here a million times?

07:50.578 --> 07:54.115
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

07:54.382 --> 07:56.179
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

07:56.284 --> 07:59.549
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

07:59.654 --> 08:02.521
Wait. You read?

08:02.623 --> 08:07.424
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

08:07.528 --> 08:12.124
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

08:12.233 --> 08:16.363
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.936
I don't like secrets.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.873
All this cooking
and reading and TV-watching

08:21.976 --> 08:24.274
while we read and cook.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.472
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

08:27.582 --> 08:28.981
Why do I let you?

08:33.654 --> 08:35.712
What's taking those kids so long?

08:36.791 --> 08:39.817
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

08:40.061 --> 08:43.655
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

08:43.764 --> 08:46.426
<i>Forget mystique.</i>
<i>This is about your cooking.</i>

08:46.534 --> 08:49.002
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

08:49.136 --> 08:50.383
<i>Great cooking</i>
<i>is not for the faint of heart.</i>

08:50.418 --> 08:51.631
<i>Great cooking</i>
<i>is not for the faint of heart.</i>

08:51.739 --> 08:54.367
<i>You must be imaginative,</i>
<i>strong hearted.</i>

08:54.475 --> 08:56.534
<i>You must try things that may not work.</i>

08:56.644 --> 08:58.737
<i>And you must not let anyone</i>
<i>define your limits</i>

08:58.846 --> 09:00.973
<i>because of where you come from.</i>

09:01.082 --> 09:03.346
<i>Your only limit is your soul.</i>

09:03.451 --> 09:10.414
<i>What I say is true. Anyone can cook.</i>
<i>But only the fearless can be great.</i>

09:11.125 --> 09:12.490
Pure poetry.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.618
<i>But it was not to last.</i>

09:15.029 --> 09:17.896
<i>Gusteau's restaurant lost</i>
<i>one of its five stars</i>

09:17.999 --> 09:22.663
<i>after a scathing review</i>
<i>by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.</i>

09:23.237 --> 09:25.364
<i>It was a severe blow to Gusteau,</i>

09:25.473 --> 09:28.499
<i>and the brokenhearted chef</i>
<i>died shortly afterwards,</i>

09:28.609 --> 09:32.705
<i>which, according to tradition,</i>
<i>meant the loss of another star.</i>

09:32.947 --> 09:35.313
Gusteau is dead?

09:49.530 --> 09:50.724
Run!

09:53.301 --> 09:55.394
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

10:14.355 --> 10:15.870
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

10:15.905 --> 10:17.385
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

10:19.660 --> 10:21.093
Try to grab you.

10:24.565 --> 10:26.396
Emile, swing to me.

11:00.134 --> 11:03.570
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

11:07.642 --> 11:09.442
Let me through!
- The book.

11:09.477 --> 11:10.171
Let me through!
- The book.

11:11.445 --> 11:13.640
Excuse me. Move, move.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.990
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.869
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

11:36.537 --> 11:37.970
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

11:38.172 --> 11:39.662
Push off. Come on.

11:40.675 --> 11:41.835
Get hold!

11:45.579 --> 11:48.480
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

11:49.517 --> 11:51.109
Hey, wait for me!

11:56.057 --> 11:58.184
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

11:58.292 --> 12:00.852
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.760
I'm coming!

12:03.631 --> 12:06.623
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.792
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

12:08.903 --> 12:10.837
Come on. Reach for it.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.000
You can do it.

12:17.178 --> 12:18.668
- Remy!
- Dad!

12:18.779 --> 12:21.509
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

12:27.521 --> 12:29.455
Guys, wait. Stop!

12:29.557 --> 12:31.616
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

12:31.726 --> 12:35.389
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

12:38.032 --> 12:39.260
Dad?

12:42.403 --> 12:43.370
Dad?

12:54.215 --> 12:55.705
Which way?

13:46.233 --> 13:47.668
<i>I waited</i>

13:50.104 --> 13:51.571
<i>for a sound,</i>

13:53.974 --> 13:55.464
<i>a voice,</i>

13:57.711 --> 13:59.235
<i>a sign,</i>

14:01.649 --> 14:03.082
<i>something.</i>

14:21.936 --> 14:25.702
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

14:27.975 --> 14:30.034
Why do you wait and mope?

14:30.477 --> 14:34.743
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

14:35.916 --> 14:37.383
probably forever.

14:37.818 --> 14:40.548
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

14:41.222 --> 14:44.953
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

14:45.159 --> 14:49.858
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are lonely.

14:49.964 --> 14:52.159
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.599
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

14:55.703 --> 14:57.432
If you focus on what you've left behind,

14:57.538 --> 14:59.904
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

15:00.007 --> 15:02.202
Now go up and look around.

15:39.346 --> 15:40.506
Champagne!

15:41.916 --> 15:43.008
What are you doing?

15:44.218 --> 15:45.344
I'm hungry.

15:45.552 --> 15:46.951
I don't know where I am,

15:47.054 --> 15:48.749
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

15:48.856 --> 15:52.451
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.563
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

15:58.232 --> 15:59.893
But I am hungry.

16:01.602 --> 16:03.263
Food will come, Remy.

16:03.370 --> 16:07.932
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.318
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.863
Paris?

17:11.472 --> 17:14.964
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

17:17.077 --> 17:18.271
Wow.

17:20.981 --> 17:22.675
It's beautiful.

17:23.884 --> 17:26.478
The most beautiful.

17:26.819 --> 17:29.414
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

17:29.523 --> 17:31.957
You've led me to your restaurant.

17:33.027 --> 17:38.226
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

17:38.332 --> 17:39.697
I got to see this.

17:40.367 --> 17:41.925
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.

17:42.036 --> 17:43.731
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.

17:43.837 --> 17:45.566
I need
more soup bowls, please.

17:45.672 --> 17:48.266
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.640
I need two salmon, three
salade composÃ©e, and three filet.

17:51.745 --> 17:53.645
Three orders
of salade composÃ©e working.

17:53.747 --> 17:55.442
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

17:55.549 --> 17:57.918
Three filet working. I need plates.

17:58.185 --> 18:00.847
Fire seven.
Three salade composÃ©e up.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.854
Don't mess with my mise!

18:03.090 --> 18:04.182
Open down low.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.226
I'm getting buried here.

18:07.394 --> 18:10.090
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

18:10.197 --> 18:12.222
<i>Bonjour,</i> chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.

18:12.332 --> 18:14.823
- Evening, chef.
Ordering <i>deux</i> filet.

18:14.935 --> 18:16.800
Hey, boss, look who is here.

18:16.904 --> 18:19.304
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

18:19.406 --> 18:21.033
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

18:21.141 --> 18:23.666
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

18:24.978 --> 18:28.106
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

18:28.215 --> 18:32.413
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

18:32.519 --> 18:34.350
- My mother?
- Renata.

18:34.455 --> 18:37.288
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

18:37.591 --> 18:40.992
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

18:41.095 --> 18:42.357
She died.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.658
I'm sorry.

18:45.766 --> 18:49.361
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.994
You know, afterlife-wise?

19:00.814 --> 19:03.908
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

19:04.151 --> 19:07.484
I think she hoped it would help me,

19:07.588 --> 19:09.988
you know, get a job here.

19:10.090 --> 19:12.752
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

19:12.860 --> 19:13.918
Any son of Renata's is more than...

19:14.027 --> 19:17.656
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

19:17.764 --> 19:18.822
We have already hired him.

19:18.932 --> 19:22.663
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

19:22.769 --> 19:24.498
We needed a garbage boy.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.605
Oh, garbage. Well...

19:27.808 --> 19:29.503
I'm glad it worked out.

19:39.286 --> 19:40.685
I can't believe it.

19:40.954 --> 19:44.117
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

19:44.358 --> 19:47.452
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

19:47.661 --> 19:49.219
Which one is the chef?

19:51.665 --> 19:53.997
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.724
Who is next in command?

19:55.836 --> 19:58.634
The sous chef. There.

19:58.972 --> 20:02.874
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

20:03.143 --> 20:06.476
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

20:06.680 --> 20:10.776
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

20:10.884 --> 20:13.682
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

20:13.887 --> 20:16.981
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

20:17.691 --> 20:19.818
Oh, him? He's nobody.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.986
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.960
No, he's a <i>plongeur</i> or something.

20:24.064 --> 20:26.555
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

20:26.667 --> 20:29.898
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

20:30.003 --> 20:32.233
How do you know?
What do I always say?

20:32.339 --> 20:33.966
Anyone can cook.

20:34.074 --> 20:38.010
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.672
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?

20:42.449 --> 20:47.079
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

20:48.889 --> 20:52.518
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

20:52.726 --> 20:54.626
It's your restaurant. Do something.

20:54.728 --> 20:57.891
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

20:57.998 --> 20:59.462
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

20:59.497 --> 21:00.927
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

21:08.308 --> 21:11.106
Table five coming up,
right now.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.282
Coming down the line.
Set.

21:29.396 --> 21:31.455
Hot! Open oven!

21:49.116 --> 21:50.708
Coming around.

22:11.305 --> 22:14.741
<i>Oui,</i> chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

22:35.195 --> 22:37.789
Fire those soufflÃ©s
for table six, <i>ja.</i>

22:37.998 --> 22:39.932
Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

22:45.305 --> 22:47.705
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

22:47.808 --> 22:49.275
It has a wonderful finish.

23:08.729 --> 23:11.163
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

23:11.264 --> 23:12.322
<i>Oui,</i> chef.

23:54.074 --> 23:55.974
Remy! What are you waiting for?

23:56.076 --> 23:57.907
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

23:58.011 --> 24:00.673
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

24:55.502 --> 24:59.962
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.667
Move it, garbage boy!

25:03.376 --> 25:05.936
You are cooking?

25:06.146 --> 25:09.582
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

25:09.683 --> 25:11.742
Where do you get the gall

25:11.852 --> 25:15.481
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

25:15.589 --> 25:17.580
I should have you drawn
and quartered!

25:17.691 --> 25:20.785
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.

25:21.962 --> 25:23.429
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

25:23.530 --> 25:28.695
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

25:28.802 --> 25:31.930
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!

25:34.207 --> 25:35.504
Soup?

25:36.209 --> 25:37.870
Stop that soup!

25:38.078 --> 25:41.775
No!

25:56.196 --> 25:57.288
Waiter.

25:58.899 --> 26:01.197
Linguini!

26:01.401 --> 26:02.891
You're fired!

26:03.103 --> 26:06.038
F- l-R-E-D! Fired!

26:06.139 --> 26:08.437
She wants to see the chef.

26:08.542 --> 26:10.635
But he...

26:26.026 --> 26:29.894
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

26:29.996 --> 26:32.157
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.

26:32.265 --> 26:36.326
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

26:36.503 --> 26:38.130
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

26:38.238 --> 26:39.865
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.338
Someone is asking about your soup.

26:51.451 --> 26:54.045
What are you playing at?

26:56.456 --> 26:57.718
Am I still fired?

26:57.824 --> 26:59.951
You can't fire him.
- What?

27:00.060 --> 27:03.359
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

27:03.463 --> 27:04.760
If she write a review to that effect

27:04.864 --> 27:06.832
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

27:06.933 --> 27:10.096
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

27:10.203 --> 27:12.467
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

27:12.572 --> 27:14.733
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?

27:14.841 --> 27:17.708
And what belief is that,
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Tatou?

27:17.811 --> 27:18.800
Anyone can cook.

27:23.683 --> 27:29.383
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

27:29.789 --> 27:32.053
He has taken a bold risk

27:32.158 --> 27:36.561
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

27:36.930 --> 27:39.922
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,

27:40.033 --> 27:41.523
who are we to deny him?

27:42.769 --> 27:44.999
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

27:45.105 --> 27:49.269
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

27:49.376 --> 27:50.741
you shall be responsible for it.

27:52.846 --> 27:54.279
Anyone else?

27:56.282 --> 27:58.147
Then back to work.

27:58.852 --> 28:02.379
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

28:02.622 --> 28:07.992
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

28:08.261 --> 28:11.025
Very close attention.

28:11.331 --> 28:15.768
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

28:16.002 --> 28:19.369
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

28:20.640 --> 28:21.868
Rat!

28:24.310 --> 28:25.800
- Rat!
Get the rat.

28:26.012 --> 28:28.071
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

28:28.181 --> 28:29.773
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.

28:30.483 --> 28:32.348
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

28:32.452 --> 28:34.977
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

28:35.155 --> 28:36.679
Do you know what would happen to us

28:36.790 --> 28:39.258
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?

28:39.359 --> 28:40.986
They'd close us down.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.494
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.

28:43.596 --> 28:47.726
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

29:24.404 --> 29:28.238
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

29:28.341 --> 29:30.468
They expect me to cook it again!

29:30.710 --> 29:33.474
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

29:33.580 --> 29:35.707
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.

29:35.815 --> 29:38.841
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!

29:38.952 --> 29:43.855
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

29:44.124 --> 29:46.592
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

29:47.127 --> 29:49.595
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

29:49.929 --> 29:54.025
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

29:58.071 --> 30:01.472
I need this job. I've lost so many.

30:01.841 --> 30:05.937
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

30:07.147 --> 30:08.375
Did you nod?

30:08.481 --> 30:10.608
Have you been nodding?

30:12.085 --> 30:13.848
You understand me?

30:14.387 --> 30:16.048
So I'm not crazy!

30:17.257 --> 30:19.316
Wait a second, wait a second.

30:20.393 --> 30:23.089
I can't cook, can I?

30:25.098 --> 30:26.861
But you...

30:27.534 --> 30:30.332
You can, right?

30:31.571 --> 30:34.039
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

30:34.140 --> 30:36.540
Whatever you did, they liked it.

30:37.143 --> 30:39.703
Yeah. This could work.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.775
Hey, they liked the soup!

30:45.285 --> 30:50.348
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

30:53.960 --> 30:56.394
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

30:57.197 --> 31:00.360
But we're together on this. Right?

31:02.068 --> 31:03.558
Okay.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.774
So this is it.

32:16.242 --> 32:20.079
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...

32:22.282 --> 32:23.647
Not much.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.380
It could be worse.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.887
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.423
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

32:33.459 --> 32:34.858
<i>Are you...</i>

32:34.961 --> 32:37.259
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

32:37.363 --> 32:39.661
<i>The best kind of dream.</i>

32:40.033 --> 32:41.193
<i>One we can share.</i>

32:42.435 --> 32:44.027
<i>But why here?</i>

32:44.570 --> 32:46.094
<i>Why now?</i>

32:47.040 --> 32:48.769
<i>Why not here?</i>

32:49.042 --> 32:50.771
<i>Why not now?</i>

32:51.577 --> 32:55.604
<i>What better place to dream</i>
<i>than in Paris?</i>

33:08.728 --> 33:10.958
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

33:12.465 --> 33:13.659
Oh, no.

33:15.535 --> 33:16.968
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

33:17.070 --> 33:19.868
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

33:19.973 --> 33:21.099
Eggs, gone!

33:21.207 --> 33:24.608
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

33:24.711 --> 33:27.202
That's what I get for trusting a...

33:29.849 --> 33:31.646
Hi. Is that for me?

33:41.728 --> 33:44.356
That's good. What did you put in this?

33:46.432 --> 33:47.922
Where'd you get that?

33:51.137 --> 33:55.836
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

33:59.078 --> 34:02.479
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

34:02.582 --> 34:03.844
Come on, Little Chef!

34:04.083 --> 34:05.880
"Though I, like many other critic,

34:05.985 --> 34:09.318
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

34:09.422 --> 34:13.984
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

34:14.092 --> 34:16.083
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!

34:16.529 --> 34:20.693
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.632
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

34:26.472 --> 34:27.803
Well...

34:35.614 --> 34:36.911
You know.

34:39.985 --> 34:44.116
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

34:44.223 --> 34:47.681
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

34:48.995 --> 34:51.463
So let's do this thing!

34:54.467 --> 34:55.728
I...

35:07.146 --> 35:12.584
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

35:12.819 --> 35:16.585
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

35:17.190 --> 35:18.452
Soup.

35:31.304 --> 35:32.271
You little...

35:33.439 --> 35:34.531
Ow!

35:44.183 --> 35:45.445
You son of a...

35:53.359 --> 35:55.122
You got...

36:10.676 --> 36:12.576
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

36:12.678 --> 36:15.238
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.

36:15.348 --> 36:17.782
We've got to figure out something else.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.114
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

36:20.219 --> 36:22.915
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

36:23.022 --> 36:25.718
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

36:25.825 --> 36:29.056
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

36:30.329 --> 36:31.455
Little Chef?

36:33.666 --> 36:35.327
Oh, you're hungry.

36:42.675 --> 36:45.075
Okay. So let's think this out.

36:45.511 --> 36:49.743
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear

36:50.550 --> 36:51.574
human.

36:51.684 --> 36:54.551
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

36:54.654 --> 36:57.680
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

36:57.790 --> 36:59.883
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

36:59.992 --> 37:02.984
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

37:03.095 --> 37:04.960
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

37:05.064 --> 37:06.031
We gotta communicate.

37:06.132 --> 37:10.364
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

37:12.305 --> 37:14.136
The rat! I saw it!

37:14.340 --> 37:17.400
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

37:18.444 --> 37:21.242
What are you doing in here?

37:21.447 --> 37:26.384
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

37:26.485 --> 37:27.816
Get out.

37:29.488 --> 37:32.855
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

37:33.659 --> 37:36.628
That was close. Are you okay up there?

37:48.975 --> 37:50.499
How did you do that?

38:04.657 --> 38:07.023
That's strangely involuntary!

38:09.061 --> 38:13.088
<i>One look and I knew</i>
<i>we had the same crazy idea.</i>

38:14.066 --> 38:15.590
Okay.

38:26.212 --> 38:29.010
Where are you taking me? Wait.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.552
Wait. I'm sorry.

38:44.230 --> 38:45.322
Okay.

38:55.374 --> 38:56.341
Okay.

39:56.202 --> 39:57.499
<i>Ã votre santÃ©!</i>

40:03.342 --> 40:04.741
All right.

40:31.670 --> 40:32.898
That should do it.

40:36.709 --> 40:41.737
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.

40:41.847 --> 40:46.511
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

40:46.619 --> 40:51.113
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

40:52.224 --> 40:54.590
Listen, I just want you to know

40:54.693 --> 40:57.526
how honored I am
to be studying under such...

40:57.630 --> 41:00.997
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.499
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

41:02.601 --> 41:03.966
Well, I...

41:04.069 --> 41:06.469
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

41:06.572 --> 41:08.767
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

41:08.874 --> 41:11.502
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.

41:11.610 --> 41:15.068
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.445
But still I'm here. How did this happen?

41:17.550 --> 41:20.144
Because, well, because you...

41:20.252 --> 41:22.379
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.

41:22.488 --> 41:24.149
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

41:24.256 --> 41:27.191
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

41:27.293 --> 41:28.487
Got it?

41:33.999 --> 41:38.095
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food

41:38.204 --> 41:40.229
Chine-easy.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.974
- Excellent work, FranÃ§ois, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

41:46.078 --> 41:50.310
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

41:50.416 --> 41:52.646
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

41:52.751 --> 41:57.313
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

41:57.423 --> 41:58.583
What are corn dogs?

41:58.691 --> 42:00.907
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

42:00.942 --> 42:03.124
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

42:03.429 --> 42:04.555
Whip something up.

42:04.663 --> 42:08.190
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

42:08.300 --> 42:11.497
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

42:11.604 --> 42:15.506
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.

42:42.078 --> 42:43.306
Get my lawyer!

42:44.213 --> 42:46.306
Well, the will stipulates

42:46.415 --> 42:50.181
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

42:50.286 --> 42:51.583
no heir appears,

42:51.687 --> 42:55.987
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

42:56.092 --> 42:58.083
I know what the will stipulates.

42:58.194 --> 43:03.461
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

43:07.770 --> 43:09.635
There's not much resemblance.

43:09.739 --> 43:13.266
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

43:13.375 --> 43:16.538
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

43:16.645 --> 43:19.910
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

43:20.082 --> 43:22.175
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

43:22.284 --> 43:27.244
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

43:27.356 --> 43:28.823
Highly suspect!

43:28.924 --> 43:30.789
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

43:30.893 --> 43:32.485
- May I?
- Of course.

43:32.595 --> 43:34.062
But the boy does not know.

43:34.163 --> 43:38.497
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

43:38.601 --> 43:42.594
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

43:42.705 --> 43:45.606
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

43:45.708 --> 43:48.233
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

43:48.344 --> 43:51.279
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.211
Find out how much of this is real.

43:53.315 --> 43:55.875
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

43:55.985 --> 43:57.714
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

43:57.820 --> 44:02.086
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

44:02.892 --> 44:05.087
He knows something.

44:05.194 --> 44:09.324
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

44:15.671 --> 44:16.797
What are you doing?

44:16.906 --> 44:18.874
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

44:18.974 --> 44:20.703
No! You waste energy and time!

44:20.810 --> 44:23.802
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

44:23.913 --> 44:25.073
Well, Mommy never had to face

44:25.181 --> 44:26.739
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,

44:26.849 --> 44:28.282
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

44:28.384 --> 44:29.749
and all of the different cooking times,

44:29.852 --> 44:31.046
but must arrive on the customer's table

44:31.153 --> 44:33.246
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

44:33.355 --> 44:36.017
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

44:38.661 --> 44:41.789
What is this? Keep your station clear!

44:41.897 --> 44:43.592
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

44:43.699 --> 44:45.257
Messy stations slow things down.

44:45.367 --> 44:47.665
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

44:47.770 --> 44:49.465
I'll make this easy to remember.

44:49.572 --> 44:53.064
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

44:55.144 --> 44:57.408
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.

44:57.513 --> 45:00.209
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

45:00.316 --> 45:01.442
Always return to this position.

45:01.550 --> 45:05.145
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

45:05.254 --> 45:08.155
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

45:08.257 --> 45:10.851
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.689
I know the Gusteau style cold.

45:12.795 --> 45:16.094
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

45:16.198 --> 45:19.099
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

45:19.201 --> 45:23.001
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

45:23.105 --> 45:24.572
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

45:24.673 --> 45:27.972
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

45:28.110 --> 45:30.044
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

45:30.145 --> 45:32.477
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?

45:32.581 --> 45:36.779
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

45:36.886 --> 45:37.853
Listen.

45:39.288 --> 45:42.815
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

45:43.192 --> 45:46.093
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

45:46.195 --> 45:48.129
and there are only two way
to get first pick.

45:48.230 --> 45:52.030
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

45:52.334 --> 45:54.894
<i>VoilÃ !</i> The best restaurant get first pick.

45:55.004 --> 45:58.997
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

45:59.108 --> 46:02.976
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

46:03.078 --> 46:05.638
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

46:05.748 --> 46:07.238
And then he get fired

46:07.349 --> 46:10.079
for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.

46:10.185 --> 46:11.948
Horst has done time.

46:12.054 --> 46:13.043
What for?

46:13.155 --> 46:16.522
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

46:16.625 --> 46:18.559
I defrauded a major corporation.

46:18.661 --> 46:22.153
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

46:22.264 --> 46:24.789
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

46:24.900 --> 46:27.596
I killed a man with this thumb.

46:27.870 --> 46:29.804
Don't ever play cards
with Pompidou.

46:29.905 --> 46:33.466
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.

46:33.876 --> 46:37.073
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

46:37.179 --> 46:40.148
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

46:40.549 --> 46:41.743
So you see.

46:41.850 --> 46:46.184
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

46:46.288 --> 46:49.689
- We?
- <i>Oui.</i> You are one of us now, <i>oui?</i>

46:49.992 --> 46:54.520
<i>Oui.</i> Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.

46:54.897 --> 46:57.365
- Thank you, too.
- For what?

46:57.599 --> 46:59.066
For taking it.

47:03.806 --> 47:05.000
The rat!

47:07.209 --> 47:10.235
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

47:13.916 --> 47:15.781
Have you decided this evening?

47:15.884 --> 47:19.945
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.

47:20.055 --> 47:23.616
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

47:23.726 --> 47:24.784
I know about the foie gras.

47:24.893 --> 47:26.690
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

47:26.795 --> 47:28.922
What does the chef have that's new?

47:30.866 --> 47:32.493
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

47:32.601 --> 47:33.590
Yes. What do I tell them?

47:33.702 --> 47:35.397
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

47:35.504 --> 47:36.801
What are you blathering about?

47:36.905 --> 47:38.998
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

47:39.108 --> 47:41.576
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

47:43.178 --> 47:44.509
This is simple.

47:44.613 --> 47:46.740
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

47:46.849 --> 47:48.510
something we haven't made
in a while...

47:48.617 --> 47:52.383
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

47:53.455 --> 47:58.085
They are asking for food from Linguini?

47:58.527 --> 48:00.995
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

48:01.096 --> 48:02.654
Were we saying that?

48:03.499 --> 48:06.434
Very well. If it's Linguini they want

48:06.535 --> 48:11.097
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

48:11.206 --> 48:14.300
Something definitely off menu.

48:14.710 --> 48:16.302
Oh, and don't forget to stress

48:16.412 --> 48:18.880
- its Linguini-ness.
- <i>Oui,</i> chef.

48:18.981 --> 48:23.145
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

48:23.252 --> 48:28.554
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread Ã  la Gusteau.

48:28.657 --> 48:30.284
- Colette will help you.
- <i>Oui,</i> chef.

48:30.392 --> 48:33.259
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

48:33.729 --> 48:36.163
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

48:36.265 --> 48:37.994
Gusteau himself said so.

48:38.100 --> 48:41.467
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

48:41.804 --> 48:43.135
"Sweetbread Ã  la Gusteau.

48:43.238 --> 48:45.729
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

48:45.841 --> 48:48.776
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purÃ©e,

48:48.877 --> 48:51.402
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

48:51.513 --> 48:54.277
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

48:54.616 --> 48:57.744
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

48:57.853 --> 49:00.378
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

49:00.489 --> 49:02.480
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

49:02.591 --> 49:03.785
Veal stomach?

49:12.434 --> 49:13.492
Okay.

49:21.510 --> 49:23.910
I'll be right back. Where...

49:25.314 --> 49:27.214
Hey, I got to... Hey!

49:27.549 --> 49:31.576
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

49:31.787 --> 49:33.880
Let's see, over here...

49:33.989 --> 49:35.251
I'll be back.

49:36.425 --> 49:37.483
Thank you.

49:38.393 --> 49:39.860
Excuse me. I'm going to...

49:39.962 --> 49:42.556
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

49:42.698 --> 49:44.359
I'm going to pick that up.

49:44.466 --> 49:46.661
I got some of that spice.

49:47.569 --> 49:48.763
Okay.

49:49.004 --> 49:50.130
What are you doing? You're supposed

49:50.239 --> 49:51.536
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

49:51.640 --> 49:52.971
This is the recipe.

49:53.075 --> 49:55.134
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

49:55.244 --> 49:57.769
What else have you...
You are improvising?

49:57.880 --> 50:00.314
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

50:00.415 --> 50:02.645
You're right. I should listen to you!

50:03.585 --> 50:04.950
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

50:05.053 --> 50:07.613
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

50:07.723 --> 50:09.748
Where is the special order?
- Coming!

50:09.858 --> 50:12.122
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

50:12.227 --> 50:14.889
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

50:14.997 --> 50:17.295
- The special?
- Come get it!

50:19.401 --> 50:22.063
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

50:27.376 --> 50:31.472
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

50:34.583 --> 50:35.675
Sorry.

50:37.619 --> 50:40.179
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

50:40.289 --> 50:43.315
<i>Ja.</i> It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

50:43.425 --> 50:47.020
- Did you taste it?
- <i>Ja,</i> of course, before he changed it.

50:47.129 --> 50:49.927
Good. What? How could he change it?

50:50.032 --> 50:52.125
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

50:52.234 --> 50:53.223
Ow!

50:53.335 --> 50:54.302
They love it!

50:54.403 --> 50:57.133
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

50:57.239 --> 50:59.002
I have seven more orders!

50:59.107 --> 51:01.735
That's wonderful.

51:06.448 --> 51:07.574
I'd like one of those.

51:10.118 --> 51:11.608
Special order!

51:15.490 --> 51:16.457
What is that?

51:16.558 --> 51:19.857
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

51:28.203 --> 51:29.636
To Linguini.

51:29.738 --> 51:32.298
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, <i>ja?</i>

51:32.808 --> 51:34.776
Drink now, there's plenty.

51:39.147 --> 51:41.513
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

51:42.584 --> 51:44.575
We really did it tonight.

51:49.458 --> 51:50.789
Dah!

51:54.529 --> 51:56.121
Got your toque!

51:57.132 --> 51:58.497
Oh, seriously now.

51:58.700 --> 52:03.330
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

52:03.438 --> 52:06.100
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

52:06.208 --> 52:10.008
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

52:11.613 --> 52:15.105
The <i>plongeur</i> won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

52:15.217 --> 52:17.947
He's gotten all he needs.

52:20.722 --> 52:23.589
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

52:25.093 --> 52:26.617
Good for you.

52:26.728 --> 52:30.721
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

52:30.832 --> 52:34.928
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

52:35.037 --> 52:39.235
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

52:39.341 --> 52:43.368
not to appreciate
this '61 ChÃ¢teau Latour.

52:43.578 --> 52:47.639
And you, <i>Monsieur</i> Linguini,
are no idiot.

52:48.583 --> 52:51.450
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

53:15.277 --> 53:17.142
- Remy!
- Emile?

53:17.512 --> 53:19.377
I can't believe it! You're alive!

53:19.481 --> 53:21.039
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

53:21.149 --> 53:23.083
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

53:23.185 --> 53:25.346
And what are you eating?

53:28.223 --> 53:29.986
I don't really know.

53:30.092 --> 53:33.289
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

53:33.395 --> 53:38.094
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

53:38.200 --> 53:41.692
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

53:51.213 --> 53:54.580
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

53:54.683 --> 53:58.949
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

53:59.054 --> 54:02.217
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

54:03.125 --> 54:07.084
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

54:07.462 --> 54:10.795
So, where did you train, Linguini?

54:10.899 --> 54:13.197
Train? All right.

54:13.435 --> 54:17.929
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

54:18.039 --> 54:19.370
- It's not.
- I knew it!

54:19.474 --> 54:23.205
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

54:23.311 --> 54:24.903
Monday was my first time.

54:25.013 --> 54:27.777
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

54:27.883 --> 54:30.147
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

54:30.285 --> 54:33.482
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

54:33.588 --> 54:35.613
Do you like animals?

54:35.724 --> 54:38.454
What?
Animals? What kind?

54:39.294 --> 54:43.094
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,

54:43.198 --> 54:44.358
rats.

54:45.867 --> 54:46.959
I brought you something to...

54:48.136 --> 54:49.160
No, no, no, no!

54:49.271 --> 54:50.932
Spit that out right now!

54:51.873 --> 54:55.001
I have got to teach you about food.
Close your eyes.

54:55.510 --> 54:59.913
Now take a bite of... No! No! No!

55:00.048 --> 55:03.415
- Don't just hork it down!
- Too late.

55:03.652 --> 55:04.914
Here.

55:05.220 --> 55:09.589
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

55:12.127 --> 55:14.152
- See?
- Not really.

55:14.262 --> 55:17.493
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

55:17.599 --> 55:20.625
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

55:20.735 --> 55:23.829
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

55:24.306 --> 55:29.369
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

55:29.478 --> 55:33.073
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

55:34.015 --> 55:35.175
Okay.

55:35.650 --> 55:39.108
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

55:39.321 --> 55:41.312
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

55:41.423 --> 55:43.152
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

55:43.258 --> 55:45.089
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world

55:45.193 --> 55:47.161
being combined
into infinite combinations.

55:47.262 --> 55:50.322
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

55:50.432 --> 55:51.797
I think...

55:52.968 --> 55:55.493
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.

55:55.604 --> 55:57.071
But that was interesting.

55:57.172 --> 55:59.936
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?

56:00.041 --> 56:01.406
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

56:01.510 --> 56:03.808
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

56:03.912 --> 56:05.470
- Yeah! But...
- What?

56:05.580 --> 56:08.515
Thing is, I kind of have to...

56:09.050 --> 56:11.041
What do you "have to"
more than family?

56:11.152 --> 56:12.449
What's more important here?

56:12.554 --> 56:14.146
Well, I...

56:15.624 --> 56:17.615
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

56:17.893 --> 56:19.554
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

56:19.661 --> 56:21.526
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

56:21.630 --> 56:23.120
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

56:23.231 --> 56:24.823
Nopety nopety no.

56:24.933 --> 56:27.595
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

56:27.702 --> 56:31.035
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

56:31.139 --> 56:33.539
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

56:33.642 --> 56:37.738
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

56:38.079 --> 56:39.410
If you're going to name a food,

56:39.514 --> 56:42.449
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

56:42.584 --> 56:47.817
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

56:47.989 --> 56:52.153
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

56:54.162 --> 56:59.534
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

57:02.404 --> 57:04.372
My son has returned!

57:28.263 --> 57:33.860
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

57:33.969 --> 57:37.803
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

57:38.006 --> 57:42.409
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

57:42.510 --> 57:46.037
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

57:46.147 --> 57:49.207
Yeah, well, about that...

57:49.317 --> 57:51.114
You look thin. Why is that?

57:51.219 --> 57:54.711
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

57:57.392 --> 58:00.418
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?

58:00.528 --> 58:03.588
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

58:03.698 --> 58:06.360
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

58:06.468 --> 58:10.302
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

58:10.505 --> 58:13.941
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...

58:14.042 --> 58:16.840
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

58:16.945 --> 58:21.882
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

58:21.983 --> 58:24.611
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?

58:24.719 --> 58:26.949
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.

58:27.055 --> 58:29.319
We're not birds. We're rats.

58:29.424 --> 58:32.359
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

58:32.460 --> 58:35.452
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

58:35.563 --> 58:36.587
Maybe that's a good thing.

58:36.698 --> 58:39.132
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

58:39.234 --> 58:41.464
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

58:41.569 --> 58:44.060
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

58:44.172 --> 58:46.231
I want to add something to this world.

58:46.341 --> 58:49.435
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

58:49.544 --> 58:52.206
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

58:52.313 --> 58:56.010
I've been able to
observe them

58:56.117 --> 58:59.052
at a close-ish sort of range.

58:59.154 --> 59:01.418
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

59:01.523 --> 59:05.152
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

59:06.528 --> 59:09.588
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

59:11.199 --> 59:13.633
You know, I'm going to stay here.

59:14.402 --> 59:17.894
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

59:18.006 --> 59:21.169
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

59:21.276 --> 59:23.176
Is that a problem?

59:23.411 --> 59:26.972
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

59:34.489 --> 59:35.683
We're here.

59:45.900 --> 59:48.368
Take a good long look, Remy.

59:50.004 --> 59:51.164
Now, this is what happens

59:51.272 --> 59:54.799
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.

59:55.777 --> 59:59.235
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

01:00:00.482 --> 01:00:02.609
We must live carefully.

01:00:04.052 --> 01:00:06.782
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

01:00:07.288 --> 01:00:10.883
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

01:00:15.764 --> 01:00:18.164
- No.
- What?

01:00:18.967 --> 01:00:25.167
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

01:00:25.373 --> 01:00:28.342
Can only be more of this?

01:00:28.543 --> 01:00:33.742
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

01:00:33.948 --> 01:00:39.113
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

01:00:39.554 --> 01:00:42.751
And it starts when we decide.

01:00:43.358 --> 01:00:47.590
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

01:01:11.486 --> 01:01:12.851
Hey! Yeah.

01:02:10.945 --> 01:02:12.105
Stop it.

01:02:46.481 --> 01:02:47.709
Good morning.

01:02:49.918 --> 01:02:51.385
Good morning.

01:02:52.654 --> 01:02:56.954
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?

01:02:57.058 --> 01:02:58.582
That's big.

01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:01.491
That's big. What did he say?

01:03:06.034 --> 01:03:07.001
What?

01:03:07.936 --> 01:03:09.597
What, you can't tell me?

01:03:11.673 --> 01:03:16.372
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

01:03:16.477 --> 01:03:17.842
Oh, I see how it is.

01:03:17.946 --> 01:03:20.574
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

01:03:20.682 --> 01:03:23.412
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

01:03:23.518 --> 01:03:24.985
Wake up. Wake up.

01:03:26.321 --> 01:03:29.085
I thought you were different.

01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:32.857
I thought you thought I was different.

01:03:33.328 --> 01:03:34.625
I thought...

01:03:38.333 --> 01:03:39.857
I didn't have to help you!

01:03:39.968 --> 01:03:43.301
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:44.496
But...

01:03:45.406 --> 01:03:50.002
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.277
My mistake.

01:03:54.015 --> 01:03:57.314
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

01:03:57.518 --> 01:04:00.453
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

01:04:00.822 --> 01:04:04.519
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

01:04:04.625 --> 01:04:07.958
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

01:04:08.062 --> 01:04:09.791
At least not without your help.

01:04:09.897 --> 01:04:13.298
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

01:04:13.768 --> 01:04:17.568
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

01:04:18.039 --> 01:04:19.768
When I added that extra ingredient

01:04:19.874 --> 01:04:22.707
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:25.005
That wasn't me either.

01:04:25.113 --> 01:04:28.014
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

01:04:28.116 --> 01:04:29.913
I would've followed the recipe.

01:04:30.018 --> 01:04:31.383
I would've followed your advice.

01:04:31.486 --> 01:04:33.317
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:37.585
- Because I love your advice.
- But...

01:04:37.692 --> 01:04:39.353
But I...

01:04:39.727 --> 01:04:41.024
Don't do it.

01:04:41.129 --> 01:04:44.428
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:49.702
- I have a...
- What? You...

01:04:49.804 --> 01:04:54.002
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?

01:04:54.142 --> 01:04:59.409
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

01:04:59.614 --> 01:05:00.774
Little...

01:05:01.816 --> 01:05:03.977
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.

01:05:04.085 --> 01:05:06.076
A tiny chef?

01:05:06.187 --> 01:05:08.712
Yes. Yes. He's...

01:05:10.558 --> 01:05:13.686
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

01:05:15.396 --> 01:05:19.162
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

01:05:20.301 --> 01:05:24.203
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

01:05:24.405 --> 01:05:29.172
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

01:05:29.277 --> 01:05:31.472
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

01:05:31.579 --> 01:05:33.604
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

01:05:33.714 --> 01:05:36.444
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!

01:05:39.987 --> 01:05:41.113
No! No!

01:06:26.367 --> 01:06:28.892
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

01:06:29.003 --> 01:06:31.904
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

01:06:32.006 --> 01:06:35.100
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:37.734
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

01:06:37.845 --> 01:06:39.676
What? What? Spit it out.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.216
It's come back. It's popular.

01:06:47.522 --> 01:06:51.151
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

01:06:51.259 --> 01:06:52.351
My last review condemned it

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.984
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:54.095 --> 01:06:58.293
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

01:06:58.399 --> 01:07:02.165
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:04.033
<i>"Monsieur</i> Boyardee."

01:07:04.138 --> 01:07:05.127
TouchÃ©.

01:07:05.239 --> 01:07:08.606
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

01:07:08.776 --> 01:07:11.745
- The last word.
- Yes.

01:07:11.846 --> 01:07:14.144
Then tell me, Ambrister,

01:07:15.082 --> 01:07:19.018
how could it be popular?

01:07:19.954 --> 01:07:24.516
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:27.753
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

01:07:27.862 --> 01:07:29.090
He is Gusteau's son.

01:07:29.197 --> 01:07:33.099
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

01:07:33.201 --> 01:07:34.532
The boy knows!

01:07:34.635 --> 01:07:37.627
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

01:07:37.738 --> 01:07:42.141
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

01:07:42.243 --> 01:07:44.677
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

01:07:44.779 --> 01:07:46.838
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

01:07:46.948 --> 01:07:48.643
Yes. He's consorting with it.

01:07:48.749 --> 01:07:51.274
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.

01:07:51.385 --> 01:07:53.876
- The rat.
- Exactly!

01:07:55.189 --> 01:07:57.783
Is the rat important?

01:07:58.025 --> 01:08:01.256
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

01:08:01.362 --> 01:08:03.626
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:06.393
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.025
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

01:08:11.072 --> 01:08:13.131
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:16.471
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

01:08:16.577 --> 01:08:17.669
But, oh, no!

01:08:17.778 --> 01:08:21.975
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...

01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:30.680
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

01:08:50.611 --> 01:08:52.511
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.

01:08:52.613 --> 01:08:54.979
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

01:08:55.082 --> 01:08:57.550
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

01:08:57.652 --> 01:08:59.279
What are you so worried about?

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:00.615
Isn't it good to have the press?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.349
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:05.857
Not if they're over his face!

01:09:06.394 --> 01:09:10.057
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

01:09:10.163 --> 01:09:15.124
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

01:09:15.236 --> 01:09:17.203
The deadline passes in three days.

01:09:17.305 --> 01:09:20.240
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

01:09:20.341 --> 01:09:22.468
and no one will ever know.

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:25.444
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.

01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:27.979
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:32.609
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

01:09:38.326 --> 01:09:39.554
- No, no, no.
- What?

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.957
Try this. It's better.

01:09:56.043 --> 01:09:58.170
Well, because you...

01:10:22.436 --> 01:10:23.403
Rat!

01:10:29.944 --> 01:10:32.174
Disgusting little creatures.

01:10:42.056 --> 01:10:44.991
<i>I was reminded</i>
<i>how fragile it all was.</i>

01:10:45.893 --> 01:10:48.020
<i>How the world really saw me.</i>

01:10:49.563 --> 01:10:52.794
<i>And it just kept getting better.</i>

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:53.499
Remy!

01:10:53.534 --> 01:10:54.466
Remy!

01:10:54.568 --> 01:10:55.830
Psst! Psst!

01:10:58.005 --> 01:11:00.405
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

01:11:00.608 --> 01:11:04.135
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

01:11:04.345 --> 01:11:08.145
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

01:11:08.249 --> 01:11:11.116
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!

01:11:11.218 --> 01:11:12.981
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

01:11:13.087 --> 01:11:14.179
I didn't think you meant them.

01:11:14.288 --> 01:11:16.381
Look, I'm sorry.

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:18.958
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

01:11:19.059 --> 01:11:23.621
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:25.028
Wait here.

01:11:30.905 --> 01:11:32.167
It's locked?

01:11:39.213 --> 01:11:41.010
Remy, what are you doing in here?

01:11:41.115 --> 01:11:43.913
Okay. Emile shows up with...

01:11:44.018 --> 01:11:47.954
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

01:11:48.155 --> 01:11:50.214
Yeah, it's a disaster.

01:11:50.324 --> 01:11:53.953
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:56.160
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

01:11:56.195 --> 01:11:58.260
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

01:11:58.365 --> 01:12:02.165
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

01:12:02.269 --> 01:12:04.897
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

01:12:05.005 --> 01:12:07.064
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?

01:12:07.174 --> 01:12:08.232
Or microwave burritos?

01:12:08.342 --> 01:12:10.401
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

01:12:10.511 --> 01:12:12.274
About as French as a corn dog!

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.504
Coming soon!

01:12:13.614 --> 01:12:15.514
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

01:12:15.616 --> 01:12:17.208
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

01:12:17.318 --> 01:12:18.979
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.

01:12:19.086 --> 01:12:21.486
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

01:12:22.556 --> 01:12:26.617
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

01:12:26.727 --> 01:12:29.992
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:31.121
Here it is.

01:12:31.565 --> 01:12:33.863
Hey. Your will!

01:12:33.968 --> 01:12:38.598
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:42.640
Linguini?

01:12:43.477 --> 01:12:46.207
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?

01:12:46.313 --> 01:12:48.144
This used to be my office.

01:13:11.438 --> 01:13:12.905
He's your son?

01:13:13.007 --> 01:13:15.874
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:19.969
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.931
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

01:13:21.966 --> 01:13:23.782
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

01:13:25.185 --> 01:13:26.854
No! No! The rat!

01:13:32.927 --> 01:13:35.725
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!

01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:38.195
- It's getting away!
Hey, Mr. Chef!

01:15:12.526 --> 01:15:14.118
You!

01:15:14.228 --> 01:15:18.892
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

01:15:22.136 --> 01:15:24.104
Bottoms up, Linguini!

01:15:24.204 --> 01:15:26.604
<i></i>

01:15:26.707 --> 01:15:27.969
Cheers, <i>ja.</i>

01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:37.507
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!

01:16:38.712 --> 01:16:41.772
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

01:16:41.882 --> 01:16:43.315
What is the secret to your genius?

01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:47.012
Secret? You want the truth?

01:16:47.688 --> 01:16:53.149
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.592
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.

01:16:55.696 --> 01:16:56.663
No.

01:16:56.764 --> 01:16:59.528
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.

01:16:59.633 --> 01:17:01.123
How did you find out?

01:17:01.235 --> 01:17:04.500
Well, some part of me just knew.

01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:06.369
The Gusteau part?

01:17:07.775 --> 01:17:12.405
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

01:17:12.613 --> 01:17:15.241
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:18.909
Something's stuck in my teeth.

01:17:22.422 --> 01:17:23.719
Health Inspector.

01:17:23.824 --> 01:17:26.452
I wish to report a rat infestation.

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.752
It's taken over my...

01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:30.227
Gusteau's restaurant.

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:31.388
<i>Gusteau's, eh?</i>

01:17:31.532 --> 01:17:35.696
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

01:17:35.803 --> 01:17:37.896
<i>It must happen now!</i>
<i>It's a gourmet restaurant!</i>

01:17:38.005 --> 01:17:40.872
<i>Monsieur,</i> I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.

01:17:40.974 --> 01:17:43.067
But the rat!
You must...

01:17:44.745 --> 01:17:46.645
It stole my documents.

01:17:47.848 --> 01:17:49.406
It's past opening time.

01:17:49.516 --> 01:17:51.950
He should have
finished an hour ago.

01:17:53.854 --> 01:17:56.084
<i>Bonjour, ma chÃ©rie.</i>
Join us.

01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:58.317
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

01:17:58.525 --> 01:18:00.823
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

01:18:02.095 --> 01:18:04.495
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

01:18:07.134 --> 01:18:08.863
- It's him.
- Ego?

01:18:08.969 --> 01:18:09.936
Anton Ego!

01:18:10.137 --> 01:18:11.399
Is that Ego?

01:18:12.172 --> 01:18:13.605
I can't believe it.

01:18:13.774 --> 01:18:17.039
- You are <i>Monsieur</i> Linguini?
- Hello.

01:18:17.144 --> 01:18:21.638
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

01:18:21.748 --> 01:18:25.445
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

01:18:25.552 --> 01:18:27.713
as you are new to this game.

01:18:28.989 --> 01:18:30.251
- Game?
- Yes.

01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:33.417
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

01:18:33.527 --> 01:18:38.658
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

01:18:38.866 --> 01:18:40.925
You're Anton Ego.

01:18:42.502 --> 01:18:45.403
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.

01:18:47.007 --> 01:18:49.976
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.607
I don't like food. I love it.

01:18:58.051 --> 01:19:02.283
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

01:19:03.657 --> 01:19:07.616
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:10.859
Pray you don't disappoint me.

01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:21.607
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

01:19:21.708 --> 01:19:24.836
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

01:19:26.713 --> 01:19:28.271
Don't give me that look.

01:19:28.382 --> 01:19:30.543
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:35.088
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:36.450
And that's another thing.

01:19:36.556 --> 01:19:39.457
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

01:19:39.559 --> 01:19:42.153
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.

01:19:42.262 --> 01:19:43.752
All right, that's it!

01:19:47.868 --> 01:19:49.597
You take a break, Little Chef.

01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:50.931
I'm not your puppet,

01:19:51.038 --> 01:19:54.132
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

01:19:54.241 --> 01:19:56.038
The rat is the cook.

01:19:56.143 --> 01:19:57.592
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

01:19:57.627 --> 01:19:59.041
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

01:19:59.146 --> 01:20:02.115
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:06.583
You stupid...

01:20:09.122 --> 01:20:12.353
Wow. I have never seen that before.

01:20:12.459 --> 01:20:15.758
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.

01:20:17.264 --> 01:20:18.754
I'm sorry, Remy.

01:20:18.865 --> 01:20:19.854
I know there are too many guys.

01:20:19.967 --> 01:20:20.934
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

01:20:21.034 --> 01:20:22.865
It's okay. I've been selfish.

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:24.995
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?

01:20:25.105 --> 01:20:28.074
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

01:20:28.175 --> 01:20:29.335
- In fact...
- Yeah.

01:20:29.443 --> 01:20:31.809
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

01:20:33.447 --> 01:20:34.971
Little Chef?

01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:49.191
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.

01:21:08.849 --> 01:21:09.907
Oof!

01:21:26.133 --> 01:21:27.532
Little Chef?

01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:29.563
Little Chef?

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.895
Hey, Little Chef.

01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:35.299
I thought you went back
to the apartment.

01:21:35.509 --> 01:21:39.639
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.007
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

01:21:45.052 --> 01:21:46.952
Look, I don't want to fight.

01:21:47.154 --> 01:21:49.782
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:53.323
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?

01:21:53.427 --> 01:21:54.689
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

01:21:54.795 --> 01:21:56.695
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

01:21:57.964 --> 01:21:59.522
people will be disappointed.

01:21:59.933 --> 01:22:01.525
It's weird.

01:22:01.635 --> 01:22:04.570
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,

01:22:04.671 --> 01:22:07.469
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.

01:22:07.574 --> 01:22:10.338
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

01:22:10.444 --> 01:22:12.605
is because of you.

01:22:14.247 --> 01:22:15.942
I haven't been fair to you.

01:22:16.049 --> 01:22:19.507
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

01:22:19.719 --> 01:22:21.414
You've been a good friend.

01:22:21.621 --> 01:22:24.647
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...

01:22:26.593 --> 01:22:27.890
What is this?

01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:30.056
What's going on?

01:22:32.499 --> 01:22:33.488
What...

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.567
Hey...

01:22:35.168 --> 01:22:36.465
You're...

01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:39.630
You're stealing food? How could you?

01:22:39.739 --> 01:22:42.867
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

01:22:43.076 --> 01:22:45.306
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

01:22:45.412 --> 01:22:46.811
And don't come back

01:22:46.913 --> 01:22:50.371
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

01:22:58.492 --> 01:23:01.757
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

01:23:02.295 --> 01:23:05.696
We are what we are, and we're rats.

01:23:07.167 --> 01:23:10.967
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

01:23:11.438 --> 01:23:12.837
Steal all you want.

01:23:12.939 --> 01:23:15.874
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

01:23:30.457 --> 01:23:32.925
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

01:23:33.026 --> 01:23:37.827
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

01:23:43.203 --> 01:23:44.761
Come in!

01:23:44.971 --> 01:23:48.168
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

01:23:48.275 --> 01:23:52.143
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

01:23:55.482 --> 01:23:56.972
Attention.

01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:59.853
Attention, everyone.

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.250
Tonight is a big night.

01:24:02.455 --> 01:24:06.323
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

01:24:06.526 --> 01:24:10.485
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

01:24:11.198 --> 01:24:14.167
And he's going to order something.

01:24:14.768 --> 01:24:16.793
Something from our menu.

01:24:17.504 --> 01:24:21.600
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:23.573
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?

01:24:23.677 --> 01:24:27.306
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

01:24:27.414 --> 01:24:28.642
I'm hungry!

01:24:28.748 --> 01:24:31.376
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

01:24:31.484 --> 01:24:34.544
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

01:24:34.921 --> 01:24:36.980
- Observe.
- No, wait!

01:24:38.625 --> 01:24:42.493
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.

01:24:45.065 --> 01:24:51.334
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:54.969
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

01:24:55.075 --> 01:24:57.475
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

01:24:57.777 --> 01:25:01.543
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

01:25:01.648 --> 01:25:04.378
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?

01:25:06.386 --> 01:25:10.550
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

01:25:10.657 --> 01:25:12.522
Yeah! Let's...

01:25:12.959 --> 01:25:14.153
Okay.

01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:18.496
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

01:25:18.698 --> 01:25:22.759
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

01:25:22.869 --> 01:25:26.635
And I, in return, will not kill you.

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:33.573
<i>Au revoir,</i> rat!

01:25:40.787 --> 01:25:43.449
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

01:25:43.556 --> 01:25:45.080
Yes, I think I do.

01:25:45.592 --> 01:25:49.722
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

01:25:49.829 --> 01:25:51.888
you know what I'm craving?

01:25:52.966 --> 01:25:56.231
A little perspective.

01:25:56.436 --> 01:26:01.499
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

01:26:01.608 --> 01:26:04.406
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?

01:26:04.511 --> 01:26:09.414
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

01:26:09.516 --> 01:26:10.676
I am...

01:26:11.818 --> 01:26:14.582
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

01:26:14.688 --> 01:26:18.055
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,

01:26:18.158 --> 01:26:19.682
I'll make you a deal.

01:26:19.793 --> 01:26:23.889
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

01:26:23.997 --> 01:26:28.024
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

01:26:28.134 --> 01:26:29.931
I'm afraid I...

01:26:31.638 --> 01:26:34.004
Your dinner selection?

01:26:34.708 --> 01:26:39.475
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

01:26:39.579 --> 01:26:43.037
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

01:26:46.786 --> 01:26:49.687
I will have whatever he is having.

01:26:56.529 --> 01:27:00.021
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

01:27:00.233 --> 01:27:03.259
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:06.371
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

01:27:06.573 --> 01:27:10.339
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

01:27:10.677 --> 01:27:13.043
You are free.

01:27:13.246 --> 01:27:16.647
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:17.978
As you are.

01:27:18.084 --> 01:27:22.714
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

01:27:22.822 --> 01:27:25.222
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

01:27:25.325 --> 01:27:28.055
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!

01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:30.129
You only tell me stuff I already know!

01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:33.222
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:35.301
Why do I need to pretend?

01:27:37.404 --> 01:27:39.031
But you don't, Remy.

01:27:39.839 --> 01:27:41.466
You never did.

01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.418
No. My other left!

01:27:52.619 --> 01:27:54.416
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

01:27:54.621 --> 01:27:56.919
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

01:27:57.223 --> 01:27:58.212
Dad!

01:27:58.858 --> 01:28:01.383
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

01:28:04.931 --> 01:28:06.990
I love you guys!

01:28:09.068 --> 01:28:10.126
Where are you going?

01:28:10.236 --> 01:28:12.761
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

01:28:12.872 --> 01:28:16.433
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:25.947
It's your recipe.

01:28:26.052 --> 01:28:28.111
How can you not know
your own recipe?

01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:31.156
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.

01:28:31.257 --> 01:28:34.351
Then make it come to you again, <i>ja?</i>
Because we can't serve this!

01:28:34.461 --> 01:28:35.428
Where's my order?

01:28:35.528 --> 01:28:37.894
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

01:28:37.997 --> 01:28:39.055
This is what they're ordering.

01:28:39.165 --> 01:28:41.497
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:43.296
We cannot be all out. We just opened.

01:28:43.403 --> 01:28:46.395
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

01:28:46.506 --> 01:28:48.633
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:50.106
I don't know what I did.

01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:51.939
We need to tell
the customers something.

01:28:52.045 --> 01:28:53.945
Then tell them... Tell them...

01:29:00.053 --> 01:29:02.385
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

01:29:02.489 --> 01:29:04.514
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

01:29:04.624 --> 01:29:08.628
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

01:29:09.062 --> 01:29:10.029
Rats!

01:29:11.798 --> 01:29:13.356
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

01:29:13.833 --> 01:29:15.460
Don't touch him!

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:20.136
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

01:29:21.441 --> 01:29:23.739
I know this sounds insane, but...

01:29:23.843 --> 01:29:26.403
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.

01:29:26.513 --> 01:29:28.310
But that doesn't mean it's not

01:29:28.414 --> 01:29:30.609
the truth.

01:29:31.317 --> 01:29:35.549
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

01:29:36.322 --> 01:29:40.224
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

01:29:40.326 --> 01:29:45.423
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

01:29:45.765 --> 01:29:47.699
He's been controlling my actions.

01:29:49.769 --> 01:29:53.330
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:56.634
The reason Ego is outside that door.

01:29:56.876 --> 01:29:59.674
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.

01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:01.538
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

01:30:01.648 --> 01:30:04.617
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?

01:30:06.352 --> 01:30:10.516
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:13.458
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:18.998
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

01:30:19.732 --> 01:30:22.132
What do you say? You with me?

01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:11.076
Dad.

01:32:15.181 --> 01:32:18.150
Dad, I don't know what to say.

01:32:18.351 --> 01:32:22.378
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.

01:32:22.789 --> 01:32:26.657
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

01:32:26.859 --> 01:32:29.623
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.

01:32:29.729 --> 01:32:33.563
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

01:32:34.267 --> 01:32:36.667
This really means that much to you?

01:32:44.677 --> 01:32:47.646
We're not cooks, but we are family.

01:32:47.847 --> 01:32:50.839
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

01:32:58.825 --> 01:33:02.454
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

01:33:02.662 --> 01:33:04.789
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.651
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

01:33:29.686 --> 01:33:31.383
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

01:33:31.591 --> 01:33:37.029
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:39.821
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

01:33:49.542 --> 01:33:51.510
We need someone to wait tables.

01:34:06.793 --> 01:34:09.819
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

01:34:09.929 --> 01:34:12.193
Please, take all of the time you need.

01:34:15.368 --> 01:34:17.962
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

01:34:22.275 --> 01:34:24.607
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:27.042
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

01:34:27.146 --> 01:34:30.673
Easy with that sole meuniÃ¨re.
Less salt. More butter.

01:34:30.883 --> 01:34:32.783
Only use the mimolette cheese.

01:34:32.919 --> 01:34:36.548
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

01:34:36.756 --> 01:34:39.384
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composÃ©e.

01:34:39.492 --> 01:34:42.586
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

01:34:42.762 --> 01:34:46.926
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

01:34:47.133 --> 01:34:49.465
Good. Too much salt. Good.

01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:52.570
Don't boil the consommÃ©,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

01:34:52.672 --> 01:34:53.764
Sorry.

01:34:57.376 --> 01:34:59.537
Colette, wait! Colette.

01:34:59.979 --> 01:35:04.006
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.

01:35:04.116 --> 01:35:05.674
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.

01:35:05.785 --> 01:35:08.253
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

01:35:11.357 --> 01:35:13.848
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

01:35:13.993 --> 01:35:16.962
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?

01:35:35.448 --> 01:35:37.313
What? I am making ratatouille.

01:35:38.484 --> 01:35:40.952
Well, how would you prepare it?

01:36:12.985 --> 01:36:16.148
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

01:37:07.039 --> 01:37:08.802
No, it can't be.

01:37:09.408 --> 01:37:13.037
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

01:37:20.052 --> 01:37:21.679
I can't remember the last time

01:37:21.787 --> 01:37:25.086
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

01:37:26.058 --> 01:37:28.856
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

01:37:28.961 --> 01:37:31.054
of having my waiter be the chef.

01:37:31.263 --> 01:37:34.198
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

01:37:35.267 --> 01:37:37.735
Then who do I thank for the meal?

01:37:38.604 --> 01:37:40.299
Excuse me a minute.

01:37:51.317 --> 01:37:52.306
You must be the chef...

01:37:52.418 --> 01:37:54.545
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

01:37:54.653 --> 01:37:56.712
until all the other customer have gone.

01:37:58.758 --> 01:37:59.918
So be it.

01:38:21.614 --> 01:38:24.139
<i>At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.</i>

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:30.289
<i>But as Linguini explains,</i>
<i>Ego's smile disappears.</i>

01:38:35.895 --> 01:38:39.956
<i>He doesn't react</i>
<i>beyond asking an occasional question.</i>

01:38:40.499 --> 01:38:44.868
<i>And when the story is done,</i>
<i>Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...</i>

01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:46.631
Thank you for the meal.

01:38:46.739 --> 01:38:49.606
<i>... and leaves without another word.</i>

01:38:51.877 --> 01:38:55.813
<i>The following day his review appears.</i>

01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:02.446
<i>In many ways,</i>
<i>the work of a critic is easy.</i>

01:39:02.655 --> 01:39:06.887
<i>We risk very little,</i>
<i>yet enjoy a position over those</i>

01:39:06.992 --> 01:39:11.053
<i>who offer up their work</i>
<i>and their selves to our judgment.</i>

01:39:11.297 --> 01:39:16.667
<i>We thrive on negative criticism,</i>
<i>which is fun to write and to read.</i>

01:39:17.203 --> 01:39:23.733
<i>But the bitter truth we critics must face</i>
<i>is that in the grand scheme of things,</i>

01:39:23.843 --> 01:39:27.836
<i>the average piece of junk</i>
<i>is probably more meaningful</i>

01:39:27.947 --> 01:39:31.212
<i>than our criticism designating it so.</i>

01:39:31.584 --> 01:39:35.714
<i>But there are times</i>
<i>when a critic truly risks something</i>

01:39:35.821 --> 01:39:40.121
<i>and that is in the discovery</i>
<i>and defense of the new.</i>

01:39:40.226 --> 01:39:44.822
<i>The world is often unkind</i>
<i>to new talent, new creations.</i>

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:47.498
<i>The new needs friends.</i>

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.327
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>I experienced something new,</i>

01:39:51.537 --> 01:39:56.497
<i>an extraordinary meal</i>
<i>from a singularly unexpected source.</i>

01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:59.337
<i>To say that both the meal</i>
<i>and its maker</i>

01:39:59.445 --> 01:40:02.937
<i>have challenged my preconceptions</i>
<i>about fine cooking</i>

01:40:03.048 --> 01:40:05.744
<i>is a gross understatement.</i>

01:40:06.152 --> 01:40:09.349
<i>They have rocked me to my core.</i>

01:40:10.089 --> 01:40:13.547
<i>In the past, I have made no secret</i>
<i>of my disdain</i>

01:40:13.659 --> 01:40:18.619
<i>for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,</i>
<i>"Anyone can cook."</i>

01:40:18.931 --> 01:40:25.131
<i>But I realize only now</i>
<i>do I truly understand what he meant.</i>

01:40:25.437 --> 01:40:29.373
<i>Not everyone</i>
<i>can become a great artist,</i>

01:40:29.475 --> 01:40:33.809
<i>but a great artist</i>
<i>can come from anywhere.</i>

01:40:34.413 --> 01:40:37.678
<i>It is difficult to imagine</i>
<i>more humble origins</i>

01:40:37.783 --> 01:40:41.651
<i>than those of the genius</i>
<i>now cooking at Gusteau's,</i>

01:40:41.754 --> 01:40:44.587
<i>who is, in this critic's opinion,</i>

01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:48.922
<i>nothing less</i>
<i>than the finest chef in France.</i>

01:40:49.128 --> 01:40:51.791
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,</i>
<i>hungry for more.</i>

01:40:51.826 --> 01:40:54.454
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,</i>
<i>hungry for more.</i>

01:40:54.833 --> 01:40:56.357
<i>It was a great night.</i>

01:40:56.468 --> 01:40:58.197
<i> The happiest of my life.</i>

01:40:58.304 --> 01:41:02.832
<i>But the only thing predictable</i>
<i>about life is its unpredictability.</i>

01:41:02.942 --> 01:41:06.105
<i>Well, we had to let Skinner</i>
<i>and the health inspector loose,</i>

01:41:06.212 --> 01:41:08.612
<i>and of course they ratted us out.</i>

01:41:08.981 --> 01:41:10.608
<i>The food didn't matter.</i>

01:41:10.716 --> 01:41:13.082
<i>Once it got out</i>
<i>there were rats in the kitchen,</i>

01:41:13.185 --> 01:41:15.244
<i>oh, man, the restaurant was closed</i>

01:41:15.354 --> 01:41:18.084
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:20.124
But don't feel too bad for him.

01:41:20.226 --> 01:41:23.718
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

01:41:24.063 --> 01:41:26.623
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know?

01:41:31.136 --> 01:41:33.195
<i></i>

01:41:34.807 --> 01:41:36.934
Got to go. Dinner rush.

01:41:44.516 --> 01:41:46.177
You know how he likes it.

01:41:51.557 --> 01:41:53.149
Thanks, Little Chef.

01:41:59.832 --> 01:42:02.665
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

01:42:02.768 --> 01:42:05.896
- Don't you always?
- Which one would you like?

01:42:07.039 --> 01:42:08.870
Surprise me.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.716
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

01:42:21.186 --> 01:42:24.849
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?

01:42:26.759 --> 01:42:29.853
Come on. Bring some food over here,
we're starving!
