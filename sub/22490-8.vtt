00:19.152 --> 00:20.983
It's alive!

00:41.508 --> 00:42.975
Oh, yeah!

00:43.009 --> 00:46.035
I'm wealthy and successful.
Fantastic!

00:49.015 --> 00:50.482
Ready for this?

00:50.517 --> 00:51.779
You're going down, devil.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.945
Seacrest, out.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.929
You gotta love
being a stay-at-home dad.

01:09.969 --> 01:11.937
But some days are tougher
than others.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.599
Don't worry, Dad.
Señor Clean is on the job.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.201
Señor Clean, Señor Clean

01:17.243 --> 01:19.234
Need a little help?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.508
Thanks, Señor Clean!

01:24.551 --> 01:27.748
Oh, no. I no finished yet.

01:27.787 --> 01:29.118
Ha ha. What?

01:29.155 --> 01:31.020
Go see a movie, kids.

01:31.057 --> 01:32.854
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:32.892 --> 01:34.951
My wife will be home soon.

01:34.994 --> 01:37.758
Not with her brake lines cut,
she won't!

01:37.797 --> 01:40.664
Señor Clean gets it done

01:40.700 --> 01:43.828
Sometimes with my penis!

01:45.839 --> 01:47.500
Seacrest, out!

02:00.019 --> 02:02.749
Well, it is
scientifically possible...

02:02.789 --> 02:05.053
to fly a crew of men
to the asteroid...

02:05.091 --> 02:07.559
and destroy it,
saving our planet.

02:07.594 --> 02:11.621
However, it will cost
80,000 trillion dollars.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.825
Sir, is that a made-up number?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.061
Yes.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.602
The fine citizens
of this country...

02:20.640 --> 02:24.098
are reluctant to support
another tax increase.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.011
Therefore,
Congress is asking America...

02:27.046 --> 02:29.913
to vote on who goes into space.

02:29.949 --> 02:32.076
Don't we have
highly trained astronauts?

02:32.118 --> 02:34.814
Oh, that's something of a myth.

02:34.854 --> 02:35.912
And how can people vote?

02:35.955 --> 02:38.253
They can call
our special 800 number.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.418
You can vote
as many times as you like.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.826
But each call costs you $30,000.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.796
Kids, get your parents' permission.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.766
As your leader, I would be honored
if America selected me...

02:47.800 --> 02:51.133
to lead a dangerous suicide
mission into outer space.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.038
But this letter from my daddy
says I don't got to go.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.098
Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!

02:56.142 --> 02:57.632
Zoom, zoom, zoom!

02:59.145 --> 03:00.908
Zoom, zoom, zoom!

03:00.947 --> 03:02.209
The results are in...

03:02.248 --> 03:04.239
and the man Americans
have selected...

03:04.284 --> 03:06.980
to lead the meteor mission
is Harrison Ford.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.454
Ford has starred in more
top-grossing motion pictures...

03:09.489 --> 03:11.013
than any other actor alive.

03:11.057 --> 03:14.720
And now the fate of the world
is in his capable hands.

03:14.761 --> 03:18.959
Listen, I'm 62 years old.
I'm just an actor.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.829
You people are all insane.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.596
Go get him, Han Solo!

03:22.635 --> 03:24.569
I'd like to meet
the team of engineers...

03:24.604 --> 03:26.504
who will accompany me
on this mission.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.666
Actually, the remaining
five spots on the flight...

03:28.708 --> 03:30.903
will by filled by Aerosmith.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.845
We need a cool theme song
for this mission.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.507
I'm ready to ro-o-o-ock!

03:36.950 --> 03:40.181
My God. Did you just get off
the centrifuge trainer?

03:40.220 --> 03:44.350
No, I just shot smack
into both my eyeballs! Yow!

03:44.390 --> 03:46.221
That's terrible!

03:46.259 --> 03:49.194
Aw, Steven Tyler's
been clean for years.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.197
I have to write an angry letter.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.324
"Dear assfaces..."

03:53.366 --> 03:55.561
Ladies and gentlemen,
I gathered you here today...

03:55.602 --> 03:59.470
to volunteer my services
to go blow up that meteor.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.973
I mean, come on. I blew up
the friggin' Death Star...

04:02.008 --> 04:04.772
with my eyes closed.
Heh. No problem.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.279
That was just a movie, dude.

04:07.313 --> 04:12.444
Four, three, two, one, zero.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.715
Liftoff. Liftoff.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.982
Yeah!

04:21.060 --> 04:23.324
All right, this is it, people.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.354
We gotta make a perfect
three-point landing...

04:25.398 --> 04:26.831
on the surface
of a chunk of rock...

04:26.866 --> 04:29.164
traveling
14,000 kilometers an hour...

04:29.202 --> 04:30.829
and use our
positioning software...

04:30.870 --> 04:32.667
to determine
the exact locations...

04:32.705 --> 04:34.332
in which to detonate
our charges...

04:34.374 --> 04:36.239
fracturing the meteor
into small enough pieces...

04:36.276 --> 04:39.302
that will burn up harmlessly
in the earth's atmosphere.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.540
Then we gotta turn
this puppy around...

04:41.581 --> 04:43.071
and get home in one piece.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.310
Can we do this?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.681
Yeah!

04:45.718 --> 04:47.015
Are you with me?

04:47.053 --> 04:48.384
Yeah!

04:48.421 --> 04:53.484
U.S. A! U.S. A!
U.S. A! U.S. A!

04:53.526 --> 04:56.586
U.S. A! U. S...

04:59.098 --> 05:01.658
Now, that sucks donkey dung.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.126
Gotta lay low for a while.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.256
Ah, this looks
like a good spot.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.766
Once I get my body back
and reverse the gypsy curse...

05:34.801 --> 05:36.928
or whatever the hell
my origin is...

05:36.969 --> 05:39.802
I won't be hanging out
in any lettuce patches.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.799
Huh? Who's there?
Come and get some!

05:51.317 --> 05:53.945
What are you? Zombies?

05:53.986 --> 05:55.544
We have no souls.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.453
We feel no pain.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.890
With your soul,
we can finally free ourselves...

05:59.926 --> 06:02.292
from this wretched
lettuce patch.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.156
Soul, gimme your soul.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.689
So-o-o-oul

06:13.940 --> 06:15.965
- Soul! Soul!
- Soul!

06:17.110 --> 06:19.806
Gimme your soul.
Your soul!

06:23.149 --> 06:24.741
With their new souls...

06:24.784 --> 06:27.446
nothing could stop
the Lettuce Head Kids.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.751
That's where I come in.
I'm Buffy.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.121
I fight evil. It's what I do.

06:32.158 --> 06:35.093
And that's how season eight
would've started.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.096
Jesus, no wonder you quit.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.288
Give me the boobies!

06:42.468 --> 06:44.800
Seacrest, out.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.771
And welcome to
the fourth annual...

06:46.806 --> 06:49.536
Winter Pet Games
Downhill Skiing Competition.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.668
Let's hear from
some of those pet owners.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.440
Muffin was born to ski.

06:53.479 --> 06:56.175
This is Flopsy's decision,
not mine.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.944
I couldn't keep him
off the slope...

06:57.984 --> 07:00.316
even if I wanted to.
And I don't.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.378
Mr. Muggs didn't choose skiing.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.151
Skiing chose Mr. Muggs.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.350
Always nice to hear
from those pet-o-philes...

07:07.393 --> 07:09.054
Hoo-hoo,
they really hate it...

07:09.095 --> 07:11.222
when you call them that.
And they're off!

07:11.264 --> 07:12.891
You've really gotta
question the wisdom...

07:12.932 --> 07:15.400
of sending all the racers
down the hill at once.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.732
You sure do...

07:16.769 --> 07:18.430
if you're a communist, maybe!

07:20.072 --> 07:21.562
Part of being colorblind...

07:21.607 --> 07:25.543
is not being able to see
those red warning flags.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.409
Oh, there goes Flopsy.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.143
He won the Canadian nationals
earlier this year.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.152
Oh, Canada!

07:35.788 --> 07:38.348
Oh, the agony of defeat.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.261
It's Mr. Muggs!

07:45.298 --> 07:47.789
Mr. Muggs is leading the pack!

07:52.138 --> 07:54.402
Mr. Muggs wins it!

07:54.440 --> 07:57.637
What a great day
for animal sports.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.042
- Ohh. Eww.
- Gross. Eww.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.350
We now return to
<i>Behind the Music Presents...</i>

08:09.388 --> 08:11.117
<i>Electric Mayhem.</i>

08:11.157 --> 08:14.718
Times were good for Dr. Teeth
and his Electric Mayhem.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.729
The band landed a steady gig
with the Muppet Theater...

08:17.763 --> 08:19.560
and the pay was reliable.

08:19.599 --> 08:22.067
But the good times
were not to last.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.069
After a five-year run...

08:24.103 --> 08:25.968
Electric Mayhem
got the pink slip...

08:26.005 --> 08:28.701
that would change
their lives forever.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.574
<i>The Muppet Show</i> was a good gig
while it lasted.

08:31.611 --> 08:34.078
Got a lot of tail
with that kind of exposure.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.741
I even got to sleep
with Josie of the Pussycats...

08:36.782 --> 08:38.374
back when that meant something.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.044
But Kermit just couldn't keep up
the rent on the theater...

08:41.087 --> 08:45.251
and well, the mob shut us down.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.259
With their steady paycheck
suddenly gone...

08:47.293 --> 08:48.988
the band did what they could...

08:49.028 --> 08:51.019
kids' parties, bar mitzvahs...

08:51.063 --> 08:53.759
and even offering children
piano lessons.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.427
Oh, holy [Bleep].
You make me wanna pee myself.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.902
That was terrible.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.906
The band's woes weren't limited
to financial trouble.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.204
Come on, Tommy Lee's rich,
good-looking.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.539
Couldn't have been that bad.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.375
Like, he gave me hepatitis C.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.973
I only have five years to live.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.540
Are you gonna show me
those boobs?

09:11.584 --> 09:13.677
[Bleep] you, Howard. I'm dying!

09:13.719 --> 09:15.619
The band pinned
their comeback hopes...

09:15.655 --> 09:17.384
on their
<i>Star Search</i> special.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.721
But no one could foresee
the consequences...

09:19.759 --> 09:22.250
for the band's
most beloved member.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.559
Oh, ho ho. Did you see that?

09:24.597 --> 09:28.328
The drummer looks like
an epileptic rag doll.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.425
Ho ho ho!

09:29.468 --> 09:30.560
Aah!

09:30.603 --> 09:31.900
Get off me! Ha ha ho!

09:31.938 --> 09:33.405
Help! Where's Johnny?

09:33.439 --> 09:35.907
After a long history
of behavior problems...

09:35.942 --> 09:39.742
the on-air attack of Ed McMahon
was the last straw.

09:39.779 --> 09:44.011
The courts ruled that the band's
drummer Animal be put down.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.819
Oh, no! Oh, no!

09:52.858 --> 09:54.826
A reunion? Now?

09:54.860 --> 09:56.919
No, not happening, brother.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.727
Check it, my man.
Animal's dead.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.666
And Zoot?
I haven't seen Zoot in years.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.602
Not since he was
picked up in Tokyo...

10:04.637 --> 10:07.538
with 37 pounds of hash
in his bag.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.599
Today, Electric Mayhem
is no more.

10:10.643 --> 10:14.443
For these aged rockers,
there are no regrets.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.777
Hey, that's life, man.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.512
It took me this long to realize
that fame isn't what's important.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.282
It's good friends and good health.
