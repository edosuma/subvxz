02:05.821 --> 02:07.170
A company called FORYM.
- Yeah.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.519
- I thought you were a PI.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.695
- No, I told you he went back
to grad school.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.045
- In genetics
and forensic science.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.525
We test DNA samples

02:14.569 --> 02:17.006
that used to be considered
too small or too degraded.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.268

02:27.234 --> 02:30.715
- 1996,
Haley West is 15 years old.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.456
Raped and strangled
on prom night.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.502
- Hold on,
this was one of Cragen's.

02:34.545 --> 02:37.200
I remember--I remember him
talking about it.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.637
But is it cold?

02:39.681 --> 02:42.118
Didn't they catch
the--the boyfriend?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.815
- Ian Ridley, yes.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.296
He actually did confess,
and he's still doing time,

02:46.340 --> 02:49.299
but he recanted at sentencing,

02:49.343 --> 02:51.388
and the only DNA
found on Haley's body

02:51.432 --> 02:52.650
was from his saliva.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.522
I was approached
by a true crime writer

02:54.565 --> 02:56.001
looking into
wrongful convictions.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.047
He asked me if we could try
to salvage old DNA,

02:58.090 --> 03:00.136
so I'm coming to you.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.531
- Well, let's pull the files,
see if anything's there.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.143
- 654.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.580
West.
Haley West, right here.

03:14.759 --> 03:18.241
Wow, she's so young.
And a sweet face.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.504

Ian's not the killer.

03:24.769 --> 03:28.251
Hm, Burton Lowe,
the writer, he's here.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.778
- Nick, I thought you said
this place was a dump.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.303
- Ah, well, they've
fixed it up since I left.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.435
Burton Lowe,

03:42.918 --> 03:44.876
- Captain,

03:51.143 --> 03:53.624
- Burton.
- Olivia.

03:55.365 --> 03:59.195
You haven't changed.
- Neither have you.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.632
And now that we've established

04:01.676 --> 04:04.026
that we're both liars...
-

04:04.069 --> 04:05.419
- Nick, you didn't tell me

04:05.462 --> 04:09.727

04:09.771 --> 04:11.512
- Should I have?

04:11.555 --> 04:16.212
- Um, we are old friends.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.214

was an English professor.

05:12.486 --> 05:16.011
When I was 16, I started
dating one of her students.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.447
He was a senior.

05:17.491 --> 05:21.233
He was 21 years old,
and he asked me to marry him.

05:21.277 --> 05:25.237
- Look at this.
Serena would be proud.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.978

05:27.022 --> 05:29.154
that wasn't
Serena's strong suit.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.766

05:38.947 --> 05:42.516
So I called
my former captain, Cragen,

05:42.559 --> 05:45.345

that the boyfriend...

05:45.388 --> 05:48.086
- Ian Ridley.
- Confessed within 48 hours.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.654
- He did, but he was 18,
concussed, traumatized--

05:50.698 --> 05:52.221
- Concussed?

05:52.264 --> 05:54.310
- His initial story was that he
and Haley were making out

05:54.354 --> 05:56.747
when an unknown assailant
knocked him out.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.184
When he came to,
Haley was gone.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.969
- And they found
her strangled, beaten body

06:01.012 --> 06:03.058
two hours later
in Fort Tyron Park.

06:03.101 --> 06:06.931
- My take, he was probably
so guilt-ridden

06:06.975 --> 06:08.846
about what happened.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.282
- He convinced himself
that he did it?

06:10.326 --> 06:11.719

06:11.762 --> 06:13.373
- How'd you
get involved, Burton?

06:13.416 --> 06:16.114

before she died.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.465
I promised her
I'd do right by him.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.292
At his parole hearing,

06:20.336 --> 06:23.165
the board was ready to release
Ian if he showed contrition.

06:23.208 --> 06:27.517
When it was time for Ian
to apologize, he couldn't.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.998
25 years behind bars,

06:30.041 --> 06:31.956
two words away
from walking free,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.393

"I believe in two things,
the truth and miracles.

06:37.701 --> 06:40.443
I know the truth,
and I need a miracle."

06:40.487 --> 06:43.707
- New DNA technology
can be that miracle.

If there's even 15 cells
from the original sample,

06:46.057 --> 06:48.495

07:23.921 --> 07:25.880

M.E. Rogers had no reason

I pulled a favor

That wasn't very gentlemanly.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.165
- I didn't mind.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.134
- When a father is absent,

22:33.177 --> 22:34.962
it is not unusual
for a younger girl

22:35.005 --> 22:37.834
to be attracted
to an older man.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.401
- That's what this is about?

22:40.837 --> 22:43.187
- It happens a lot more
than you think.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.798
- How old were you?

22:46.930 --> 22:49.672
- Almost 17.
- And he was?

22:49.716 --> 22:51.805
- Older than 17.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.462
- Hey, beautiful.
Midnight snack?

23:07.821 --> 23:11.259

23:11.302 --> 23:13.827
- Can you believe?

23:13.870 --> 23:15.916
All those years,

23:15.959 --> 23:17.613

23:17.657 --> 23:21.269

23:21.312 --> 23:23.880

23:26.317 --> 23:28.189

- What?

23:29.364 --> 23:32.628
- Us cycling

23:32.672 --> 23:36.153
picnicking on the Great Lawn
as night falls

23:36.197 --> 23:38.199

surround us.

That could be my nanny.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.570
No, it's a text from Amaro.

24:01.614 --> 24:04.704

24:04.747 --> 24:06.445
"from Haley's underwear,

Mm.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.898

24:26.334 --> 24:29.859
Listen, I will--
I will call Carisi,

24:29.903 --> 24:32.601
and I will push him
to get Ian released.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.385
- Okay, he needs a lawyer.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.738
- And I know
exactly who to call.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.044
- My client
was completely absolved

24:41.088 --> 24:42.655
by the DNA evidence.

24:42.698 --> 24:47.094
He spent 25 years in prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.531
What possible reason
could there be for a delay?

24:49.575 --> 24:51.446
- The DA's office
is supportive.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.361
We've agreed to release
Mr. Ridley from prison.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.363
- But you haven't vacated
the conviction.

24:55.406 --> 24:56.625
- You said Roger killed her.

24:56.669 --> 24:57.931
He should pay
for what he did to Haley.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.149
- Yes, he should.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.499
- We all want justice,
but I can't

25:00.542 --> 25:02.370
just declare Murray guilty
without due process.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.067
- You did it to Ian
25 years ago.

25:04.111 --> 25:06.200
- Burton, please.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.681

the judge to expedite,

25:08.724 --> 25:10.552

to start prepping my witnesses.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.162

- My expert witnesses.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.603
Where's Amaro?

25:19.082 --> 25:20.431
- Well, thank you, counselor.

25:20.475 --> 25:22.216
Before I put Ian in the car,
he told me

25:22.259 --> 25:24.740
he feels safe in your hands.

25:24.784 --> 25:27.351
I just wish he'd had
a real lawyer the first time.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.353
It's gonna be
an adjustment for him.
