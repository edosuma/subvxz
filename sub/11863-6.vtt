00:09.558 --> 00:11.599
To your knowledge, did
the Departed drink more

00:11.600 --> 00:12.974
than two alcoholic
beverages daily?

00:12.975 --> 00:15.475
Yes.

00:18.141 --> 00:20.182
To your knowledge,
was the Departed

00:20.183 --> 00:22.140
born in a hospital?

00:22.141 --> 00:24.058
I think so.

00:25.558 --> 00:29.558
To your knowledge,
did the Departed ever
attempt suicide?

00:36.433 --> 00:38.558
I don't know.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.640
I understand you want
to protect your
husband's privacy,

00:45.641 --> 00:47.974
but the more questions
you answer honestly,

00:47.975 --> 00:50.933
the better chance
your claim will be
processed.

00:54.433 --> 00:57.057
He told me...

00:59.058 --> 01:01.432
He took some pills once

01:01.433 --> 01:03.558
in high school.

01:08.433 --> 01:10.933
So is that a "yes"?

01:15.391 --> 01:16.932
Yes.

03:25.516 --> 03:27.557
Hello?

03:27.558 --> 03:28.765
Hello. Angel?

03:28.766 --> 03:32.141
I'd like to make an appointment.

03:54.725 --> 03:56.099
Hey.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.349
I'm Angel.

03:57.350 --> 03:59.641
I'm Nora. Come on in.

04:09.766 --> 04:11.724
Have a seat.

04:11.725 --> 04:13.349
Can I get you
something to drink?

04:13.350 --> 04:16.765
No. Thanks.
I'm good.

04:16.766 --> 04:18.265
Nice mattress.

04:18.266 --> 04:19.932
That for us?

04:19.933 --> 04:21.391
That's for me.

04:22.850 --> 04:24.725
You want me to watch you?

04:27.266 --> 04:29.640
No, I want you to shoot me.

04:39.225 --> 04:40.557
No way.
No fuckin' way.

04:40.558 --> 04:42.224
Just...

04:42.225 --> 04:44.974
$2,000 for two seconds.

04:44.975 --> 04:47.182
Your ad specifically said,

04:47.183 --> 04:49.599
"Nothing is
forbidden."

04:49.600 --> 04:52.182
Lady, I fuck people.
I don't kill them.

04:52.183 --> 04:55.100
If I wanted to die,
I wouldn't need you.

05:00.225 --> 05:01.766
I'll talk you through it.

05:15.350 --> 05:17.850
It's Kevlar.

05:21.058 --> 05:23.974
All you have to do...

05:23.975 --> 05:25.932
is aim right here.

05:25.933 --> 05:27.683
Just above the stomach,
just below my heart.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.516
You've done this before?

05:34.016 --> 05:37.015
Yes.

05:37.016 --> 05:40.224
Why didn't you
just get the person
that shot you last time?

05:40.225 --> 05:41.766
She said she wouldn't
do it again.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.683
I need another thousand.

05:51.558 --> 05:53.058
OK.

06:05.016 --> 06:08.516
Go ahead.

06:26.975 --> 06:28.933
What if I miss?

06:30.475 --> 06:32.558
You won't.

06:40.808 --> 06:43.225
What happened to you?

06:57.225 --> 06:59.640
Hold it up.
Two hands.

06:59.641 --> 07:01.307
All right?

07:01.308 --> 07:02.808
OK?

07:06.850 --> 07:08.474
Aim right here!

07:08.475 --> 07:11.890
Just pull the trigger, OK?

07:11.891 --> 07:14.474
On 3.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.349
1...

07:16.350 --> 07:18.307
2...

07:18.308 --> 07:19.433
3!

07:20.850 --> 07:21.850
Do it!
Just wait!

07:21.851 --> 07:23.515
Just do it!
I can't!

07:23.516 --> 07:24.141
Just do it!
I can't!

07:24.142 --> 07:26.516
Do it now!

09:17.600 --> 09:20.224
Nora Jamison Durst,

09:20.225 --> 09:22.057
you have provided the
appropriate documentation,

09:22.058 --> 09:26.182
certifying the respondents'
status as "Departed"?

09:26.183 --> 09:27.974
Yes, I have.

09:27.975 --> 09:29.807
And you wish to dissolve
the marriage between

09:29.808 --> 09:32.807
yourself, the plaintiff,
and the respondent,

09:32.808 --> 09:34.600
Douglas Isaac Durst?

09:36.100 --> 09:38.474
I do.

09:38.475 --> 09:40.974
And is there any matter
of custody or removal

09:40.975 --> 09:43.974
of children, here named
Jeremy and Erin,

09:43.975 --> 09:46.682
to be resolved
within this application?

09:46.683 --> 09:49.141
My children are also
Departed, Your Honor.

09:52.183 --> 09:54.058
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:56.891 --> 09:59.807
Should the departed
respondent return,

09:59.808 --> 10:01.515
this will remain binding.

10:01.516 --> 10:05.515
Do you still want to proceed?

10:05.516 --> 10:09.433
My husband was sleeping with
our kids' preschool teacher.

10:14.225 --> 10:16.515
Yes, I'd like to proceed.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.890
All right.

10:17.891 --> 10:20.640
The court hereby grants
a Judgment of Divorce.

10:20.641 --> 10:24.724
While you're here,
would you like

10:24.725 --> 10:27.224
to legally revert
to your maiden name?

10:27.225 --> 10:28.474
It's just another form...

10:28.475 --> 10:31.475
No, thank you.
I'd like to remain
Nora Durst.

10:39.141 --> 10:40.641
Hey.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.474
Hey.

10:44.475 --> 10:46.474
That's a traffic ticket,
I can get you out of it.

10:46.475 --> 10:48.057
Oh. Divorce.

10:48.058 --> 10:50.515
I just got myself out of it.

10:50.516 --> 10:52.515
Oh. Small world.

10:52.516 --> 10:54.474
Me, too.

10:54.475 --> 10:56.307
You're joking.

10:56.308 --> 10:59.807
No, I should have got
the hint when she joined
the Guilty Remnant.

11:04.516 --> 11:06.515
Oh, you're not joking.

11:06.516 --> 11:08.099
Oh, no.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.599
I don't know how to joke.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.390
Do you want to go to Miami?

11:14.391 --> 11:16.140
What?

11:16.141 --> 11:17.682
I was supposed to go
to this work conference
in Manhattan

11:17.683 --> 11:19.682
on Friday, but it's
gonna be terrible,

11:19.683 --> 11:22.683
and I was thinking
maybe Miami instead.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.765
Oh, uh...

11:26.766 --> 11:29.015
Oh, I live with
my daughter, so I...

11:29.016 --> 11:30.808
Oh, fuck your daughter.

11:33.391 --> 11:36.015
I'm sorry. That...

11:36.016 --> 11:38.557
I am so sorry.

11:38.558 --> 11:39.683
Look...

11:48.808 --> 11:50.390
Department of Sudden Departure.

11:50.391 --> 11:53.724
Hi, Tracy. Is he in?

11:53.725 --> 11:56.140
Yes, he is.
OK, thank you.

11:56.141 --> 11:57.641
Hey.

12:01.308 --> 12:04.724
Come in.

12:04.725 --> 12:08.224
Ma'am, the benefits
aren't determ...

12:08.225 --> 12:11.265
Right, but our office
has nothing to say about...

12:11.266 --> 12:13.474
Hello? Ma'am?

12:15.141 --> 12:17.974
I feel like I have
the same conversation
80 fuckin' times a day.

12:17.975 --> 12:19.015
I have no idea what you mean.

12:19.016 --> 12:21.557
Sit.

12:23.100 --> 12:27.140
So, uh, you ready
for your panel,
whatever, at DROP?

12:27.141 --> 12:29.140
Yes, sir.
They put me on Day Two,

12:29.141 --> 12:31.807
along with Rhode Island
and Connecticut.

12:31.808 --> 12:35.599
Just don't let them
bully you into taking
questions about the data.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.557
All right, they gave us
a pass last year, but they're
gonna want answers this time.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.765
"I'm sorry, Sir or Madam,
I'm not qualified

12:39.766 --> 12:42.974
"to analyze the data
from our questionnaires.

12:42.975 --> 12:45.974
I don't even have access
to it before it goes to our
statisticians in Annapolis."

12:45.975 --> 12:47.974
Oh, shit.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.557
Annapolis. Speaking of,

12:49.558 --> 12:52.640
what are you doing on 121?

12:52.641 --> 12:53.641
What?

12:53.642 --> 12:54.766
I just got this email.

12:57.225 --> 13:01.015
"Please inquire ID 42ECN
as to the manner

13:01.016 --> 13:03.640
by which he/she presents
Question 121."

13:03.641 --> 13:04.766
What are you doing?

13:08.891 --> 13:11.391
OK.

13:14.683 --> 13:17.265
I'm not doing anything.

13:17.266 --> 13:20.849
It says here you're
100% affirmative.

13:20.850 --> 13:24.390
Every single one
of your applicants
answers 121 "yes."

13:24.391 --> 13:27.224
Isn't that what we're
supposed to be looking
for, a pattern?

13:27.225 --> 13:29.432
Everyone else who ask
the questions get
plenty of "nos."

13:29.433 --> 13:32.224
It's only a pattern for you.

13:32.225 --> 13:36.099
Maybe you're, um...

13:36.100 --> 13:39.099
mentioning what happened to you,

13:39.100 --> 13:42.140
hmm, you know, before you roll,

13:42.141 --> 13:44.308
just to get people comfortable?

13:45.808 --> 13:47.641
I would never do that.

13:49.141 --> 13:51.765
OK. Sure.

13:51.766 --> 13:55.432
No, I know.
I'll talk to Annapolis.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.765
Mmm.

13:57.766 --> 14:00.016
Well, enjoy the conference, OK?

14:01.891 --> 14:02.891
Hey.

14:06.141 --> 14:08.515
When you took it,

14:08.516 --> 14:11.182
when they asked you 121,

14:11.183 --> 14:13.390
what'd you answer?

14:13.391 --> 14:16.765
I said yes, all 3 times.

14:21.683 --> 14:23.432
Hello.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.265
You've reached
the Durst residence.
Please leave a message.

14:25.266 --> 14:28.099
Hi, Nora.
It's Rick Carson.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.765
Just wanted to thank you again
for being a panelist

14:30.766 --> 14:34.182
at this year's
Departure-Related Occupations
and Practices conference.

14:34.183 --> 14:37.390
Your unique perspective is
really valuable to us.

14:37.391 --> 14:41.182
And a heads-up. We're expecting
a big crowd this year,
so register early.

14:41.183 --> 14:43.599
I'm really looking forward
to meeting you in person.

14:54.850 --> 14:55.850
Look in the Bible.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.557
Look right now.
Look today!

14:57.558 --> 15:00.349
They're poisoning us!

15:03.850 --> 15:05.725
Have you seen this?

15:12.308 --> 15:13.640
He's still here.

15:13.641 --> 15:15.265
He's hiding
in a basement in Sicily.

15:15.266 --> 15:17.224
Don't trust the Vatican.
The Pope is still here.

15:22.891 --> 15:25.224
Any fucking time now.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.849
Fuck you!

15:26.850 --> 15:27.683
Sons of bitches.

15:27.684 --> 15:30.516
Can't do this to us!

15:49.808 --> 15:51.765
Ms. Durst.

15:51.766 --> 15:54.015
You are staying
with us for two nights?

15:54.016 --> 15:55.599
Mm-hmm.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.890
So what's up with all
the people outside?

15:57.891 --> 16:00.099
There's a lot more
than last year.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.432
Well, you know, anything
about the Departure
for some people.

16:02.433 --> 16:03.682
Can't let it go.
Hmm.

16:03.683 --> 16:05.682
This is the hotel's
code of conduct.

16:05.683 --> 16:08.432
Please read carefully and sign.

16:08.433 --> 16:11.265
We had some issues
with your conference
last year.

16:11.266 --> 16:12.390
Really?

16:12.391 --> 16:13.016
Better cancel the kegger.

16:13.017 --> 16:15.225
Heh heh!

16:20.516 --> 16:22.307
Registration is
on the third floor.

16:22.308 --> 16:23.807
Enjoy your stay.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.683
Thank you.

16:28.016 --> 16:29.307
OK.

16:29.308 --> 16:32.057
There you go.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.682
Hi.

16:33.683 --> 16:35.682
Nora Durst.

16:35.683 --> 16:37.682
Durst. Great.

16:37.683 --> 16:39.432
Uh...

16:39.433 --> 16:42.725
Here's your welcome bag.
Let me look up your badge.

16:46.391 --> 16:48.390
Hey, you want
a good cry, read that.

16:48.391 --> 16:50.890
He lost 4 people on the 14th.

16:50.891 --> 16:52.890
That's terrible.

16:52.891 --> 16:55.099
Isn't it? Um...

16:55.100 --> 16:57.349
looks like somebody already
picked up your badge.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.890
What?
I just got here.

16:59.891 --> 17:03.057
Well, somebody must have
picked it up by mistake.

17:03.058 --> 17:04.640
No worries.

17:04.641 --> 17:07.265
This'll get you in
to all the events.

17:07.266 --> 17:10.265
Sorry for the confusion, OK?

17:10.266 --> 17:12.682
Next person? Hi.
Your name, please?

17:12.683 --> 17:14.016
Williams.

17:18.266 --> 17:21.515
'Scuse me. I'm sorry.
I need my badge.

17:21.516 --> 17:23.807
I... I'm a panelist
tomorrow.

17:23.808 --> 17:27.348
I work for the Department
of Sudden Departure
and I'm a legacy.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.515
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.640
I'd like to give you
a legacy decal to go
on your guest badge,

17:31.641 --> 17:34.057
but we don't have any left.

17:34.058 --> 17:35.724
No, of course.
Thank you.

17:35.725 --> 17:37.724
But you understand
that if somebody
took my badge...

17:37.725 --> 17:39.515
Well, I'm sure it was
just an innocent mistake.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.557
Why don't you go
into the mixer?
Everyone is in there.

17:41.558 --> 17:43.350
I'm sure your badge
is in there, too.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.141
Yes.
Next person, please.

17:55.058 --> 17:57.890
They can
deny it all they want.
North Korea lost people.

17:57.891 --> 18:00.558
We can't ignore the possibility.

18:03.475 --> 18:07.099
Oh! God.
Hey there, easy...

18:07.100 --> 18:10.349
"Guest"?

18:10.350 --> 18:11.724
What's up? Marcus.

18:11.725 --> 18:14.349
I have the most
interesting job
at the conference.

18:14.350 --> 18:15.557
And I don't believe
in name tags.

18:15.558 --> 18:17.682
If you want to know
what I do, just ask me.

18:17.683 --> 18:19.015
It's a fucking
madhouse this year.

18:19.016 --> 18:23.515
You might want
to watch out for
Baldy over there.

18:23.516 --> 18:26.932
He's working the room,
asking people, "Do you really
want to feel this way?"

18:26.933 --> 18:29.307
It's a great fucking pitch.
I give him that.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.765
I mean, who the fuck
wants to feel this way?

18:31.766 --> 18:34.224
I have to go.
It was nice meeting you.

18:34.225 --> 18:35.807
Hey, hey, hey, Guest.

18:35.808 --> 18:39.807
So you're seriously not
gonna ask me what I do?

18:39.808 --> 18:41.724
OK, what do you do?

18:41.725 --> 18:45.140
You don't want
to know what I do.

18:45.141 --> 18:47.140
OK.

18:50.725 --> 18:56.099
We can't deny
the rising instances

18:56.100 --> 18:59.474
of Post-Departure
Delusion Disorder.

18:59.475 --> 19:02.432
Or some pundits have

19:02.433 --> 19:05.015
cheekily taken to calling it

19:05.016 --> 19:06.808
"The Prophet's Dilemma."

19:09.266 --> 19:11.557
For most of humankind's
existence,

19:11.558 --> 19:14.599
certain individuals
have come forth

19:14.600 --> 19:18.349
as self-professed interpreters

19:18.350 --> 19:20.640
of the world's mysteries.

19:20.641 --> 19:21.849
But what happens

19:21.850 --> 19:27.224
when those conversations
with God go wrong?

19:27.225 --> 19:30.849
Following a catastrophic
event or circumstance,

19:30.850 --> 19:34.890
let alone one that defies
scientific explanation,

19:34.891 --> 19:38.015
the incidence
of prophetic delusion

19:38.016 --> 19:39.599
rise dramatically.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.640
And this isn't
just megalomaniacs

19:42.641 --> 19:46.224
who make the news for a week.

19:46.225 --> 19:49.224
This is happening
to our friends,

19:49.225 --> 19:53.849
our neighbors, our own families.

19:53.850 --> 19:59.224
This belief that a higher power
is speaking to us,

19:59.225 --> 20:04.265
whether through dreams
or signs, even voices,

20:04.266 --> 20:07.265
is a powerful coping mechanism,

20:07.266 --> 20:10.640
and if left unchecked,

20:10.641 --> 20:13.557
it is a very dangerous one.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.183
Thank you, sir.

20:40.433 --> 20:43.350
I can wait as long as you want.

20:54.475 --> 20:57.558
I am so sorry.
I thought you were
somebody else.

20:59.016 --> 21:01.432
You don't remember me, do you?

21:01.433 --> 21:04.099
No.

21:04.100 --> 21:08.224
Last year, you called me
a heartless bitch at
the farewell party.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.599
I don't know...
no, that wasn't me.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.640
Yes, it was.
Your name is Nora.

21:12.641 --> 21:15.265
You lost your husband and kids.

21:16.475 --> 21:19.265
You work
for Linden-Bix?

21:19.266 --> 21:20.890
I do.

21:22.850 --> 21:24.849
You said my kids disappeared

21:24.850 --> 21:25.766
because I gave them
Frosted Flakes.

21:25.767 --> 21:29.474
No, I mentioned a correlation

21:29.475 --> 21:31.515
between eating cereals
high in sugar

21:31.516 --> 21:34.515
and pre-adolescent
Departures in a
cocktail conversation.

21:34.516 --> 21:38.307
And then you made me cry
in front of a roomful
of people.

21:38.308 --> 21:40.765
I am sorry.
Last year I didn't...

21:40.766 --> 21:42.640
I...

21:42.641 --> 21:45.600
I was having a really hard time.

21:47.308 --> 21:49.683
You're doing so much better now.

21:59.641 --> 22:01.599
May I have
your attention, please?

22:01.600 --> 22:05.140
The breakout session
of the Brandenburg Carousel
has been moved to Room 6-B.

22:05.141 --> 22:09.850
6-B in 10 minutes
for the Brandenburg
Carousel. Thank you.

22:15.766 --> 22:17.766
I'll take the next one.

22:34.433 --> 22:36.015
Holy shit! It's Guest!

22:36.016 --> 22:38.015
Oh, get in here.
We haven't seen you.

22:38.016 --> 22:40.015
You know, actually...
She's crazy, this one.

22:40.016 --> 22:41.057
I was just going.
No, no, you're not.

22:41.058 --> 22:43.057
You're going up
the elevator. Ha ha!

22:43.058 --> 22:44.224
This is wild.

22:44.225 --> 22:45.807
Get this, get this.

22:45.808 --> 22:48.224
I gave this young lady
my best "you don't
want to know,"

22:48.225 --> 22:51.390
and she still refused
to ask me what I do.

22:51.391 --> 22:53.015
Oh, I like her.
Well, guess what, Guest?
We got you now.

22:53.016 --> 22:56.932
You're coming up to
the hospitality suite
for drinks.

22:56.933 --> 22:58.613
Thanks, but I have
a panel tomorrow,
so I...

23:00.641 --> 23:03.390
Fuck, Marcus!
No, no, no, no.

23:03.391 --> 23:05.599
You have a choice, Guest.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.224
You can play by
the rules of this fucking
depressing conference

23:08.225 --> 23:12.307
like everybody else,
or you can go down
the rabbit hole with us.

23:12.308 --> 23:15.224
So what's it gonna be?

23:15.225 --> 23:16.890
You want to spend
the next two days
of your life dying,

23:16.891 --> 23:20.515
one panel at a time,
or do you want to live?

23:23.558 --> 23:26.057
Oh, ho, ho! Oh, yes!

23:26.058 --> 23:28.682
Oh, poor Patrick Johansen.

23:28.683 --> 23:31.765
It's a fuckin' tragedy,
what happened to him, yeah.

23:31.766 --> 23:34.307
Four! He lost 4.
Did you read the book?

23:34.308 --> 23:36.724
I try not to read
anything that comes
in a fuckin' tote.

23:36.725 --> 23:38.807
Leave that shit to the oranges.

23:38.808 --> 23:41.057
- What's an orange?
- The badges.

23:41.058 --> 23:42.140
You know,
some people have
the orange stickers?

23:42.141 --> 23:43.640
The legacies?

23:43.641 --> 23:46.224
Legacies, orphans, survivors.

23:46.225 --> 23:49.015
Whatever they want to be
called this year.
It's awful.

23:49.016 --> 23:50.682
It's a fucking tragedy.

23:50.683 --> 23:52.682
It's like I'm supposed
to treat them better
than anyone else?

23:52.683 --> 23:54.265
How many times am I
supposed to say
I'm sorry, right?

23:54.266 --> 23:57.765
Right, right.

23:59.641 --> 24:01.265
You pregnant, Guest?

24:01.266 --> 24:02.599
What?

24:02.600 --> 24:05.682
Any suicidal
thoughts, history
of heart problems?

24:05.683 --> 24:06.308
No.

24:06.309 --> 24:08.974
What is this?

24:08.975 --> 24:10.515
Don't worry.

24:10.516 --> 24:13.640
FDA's gonna
approve them
next year. Have fun.

24:46.433 --> 24:50.307
Yo, Guest! Guest!

24:50.308 --> 24:52.974
Why the fuck
would you work
for the DSD?

24:52.975 --> 24:55.099
I like giving people money.

24:55.100 --> 24:58.474
Whoa, whoa.
All those questions
you ask, seriously.

24:58.475 --> 25:01.807
So you really think
you're gonna find out
why them?

25:01.808 --> 25:03.390
You're gonna crack the case?

25:03.391 --> 25:05.015
I'm sorry, Sir or Madam.

25:05.016 --> 25:08.015
I'm not qualified
to analyze the data
from our questionnaires.

25:08.016 --> 25:09.599
I don't even have access to it

25:09.600 --> 25:11.640
before it goes
to our statisticians
in Annapolis.

25:11.641 --> 25:13.265
It's a fucking scam.

25:13.266 --> 25:17.015
The insurance companies
won't pay out on
the Departures

25:17.016 --> 25:19.390
because they're
technically not dead,

25:19.391 --> 25:22.099
and then your Department

25:22.100 --> 25:24.140
created this little
questionnaire

25:24.141 --> 25:25.724
so that people
won't want to collect
on their benefits.

25:25.725 --> 25:29.557
Hey, look, if
your fucking dad died

25:29.558 --> 25:31.932
in a jet ski accident, right,

25:31.933 --> 25:35.890
would you have to answer
150 yes or no questions

25:35.891 --> 25:37.932
about what food he liked

25:37.933 --> 25:40.140
or whether he had anal sex?

25:40.141 --> 25:43.474
We do not ask questions
about anal sex.
Ha ha ha!

25:43.475 --> 25:45.724
He's fucking with you, Guest.

25:45.725 --> 25:49.057
He's fucking with you.
You do an important job.

25:49.058 --> 25:52.515
We all do an
important job,
all of us!

25:52.516 --> 25:53.890
OK. Marcus?

25:53.891 --> 25:55.515
Yes?

25:55.516 --> 25:56.475
What do you do?

25:56.476 --> 25:59.849
You don't want to know!

26:01.516 --> 26:03.890
You know that's my line!
That's my line!

26:03.891 --> 26:06.266
I say that.
That's my pickup line.

26:09.141 --> 26:11.099
Open.

26:16.891 --> 26:18.890
You sell these?

26:18.891 --> 26:19.766
Forty grand a pop.

26:19.767 --> 26:22.474
Our basic models are cheaper,

26:22.475 --> 26:24.641
but they're less convincing.

26:26.933 --> 26:29.599
It looks exactly like you.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.141
Down to the appendectomy scar.

26:34.808 --> 26:37.349
We take photos
of the Departed
and home videos,

26:37.350 --> 26:40.390
whatever they
give us, and then
we slowly generate

26:40.391 --> 26:43.349
every little thing
that made them them.

26:43.350 --> 26:47.390
You know, scars,
tattoos, piercings,
body hair.

26:47.391 --> 26:50.015
Then, 4 to 6 weeks later, voila.

26:50.016 --> 26:52.015
They got their loved one back.

26:52.016 --> 26:55.057
You make people pay
$40,000 for this?

26:55.058 --> 26:57.015
Uh, heh heh heh!

26:57.016 --> 26:59.307
You think I'm soulless?

26:59.308 --> 27:02.932
You think I'm taking
advantage of these
poor, grieving people.

27:02.933 --> 27:06.224
But no, no, no, no.
They're coming to us,
you know?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.640
And......
look at this.

27:08.641 --> 27:12.140
140 million bodies disappeared.

27:12.141 --> 27:13.682
That's demand.

27:13.683 --> 27:16.724
We are simply
providing
the supply.

27:16.725 --> 27:19.807
It's pretty amazing,

27:19.808 --> 27:22.515
helping someone
rebuild the person
they lost,

27:22.516 --> 27:25.307
bit by bit.

27:25.308 --> 27:28.849
This, they can bury
in the ground.

27:28.850 --> 27:32.891
This is here,
this, this.
This is real.

27:36.266 --> 27:37.890
I want them to have that.

27:37.891 --> 27:40.808
I want them to have
something real.

27:44.266 --> 27:47.807
It's a pretty good pitch.
I'll give you that.

27:49.183 --> 27:51.182
So tell me, Guest,

27:51.183 --> 27:53.266
am I soulless?

27:54.766 --> 27:56.266
No.

27:58.141 --> 27:59.808
You have a soul.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.682
Can I kiss you?

28:06.683 --> 28:08.683
I want to kiss you.

28:10.391 --> 28:13.140
You're married.
I am married.

28:13.141 --> 28:15.807
But I still want to kiss you,

28:15.808 --> 28:18.015
and I believe

28:18.016 --> 28:19.891
you want to kiss me.

28:23.308 --> 28:24.808
OK.

28:27.891 --> 28:31.390
What? Ha ha!
What are you doing?

28:36.058 --> 28:38.224
You go, girl.

28:38.225 --> 28:40.640
Check this out.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.599
Really? You're
making me jealous.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.849
This is horrible, horrible.

28:51.850 --> 28:53.557
Don't look at this.

28:53.558 --> 28:54.890
Shh! Shh!

28:54.891 --> 28:59.225
Guest!
Guest! Guest! Guest! Guest...

29:05.266 --> 29:07.640
Nora Durst?
Yes?

29:07.641 --> 29:10.265
Security! Open up!

29:10.266 --> 29:13.265
Open this door now!
I'm coming.

29:13.266 --> 29:16.183
Open up!

29:18.350 --> 29:21.682
Yes?
Nora Durst?

29:21.683 --> 29:24.307
Yes?
You need to pack up
your things.

29:24.308 --> 29:26.765
We're escorting you
from the hotel.
What?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.724
I don't understand.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.724
You destroyed hotel property.

29:30.725 --> 29:33.724
The mirror in the bar?
I wasn't in the bar.

29:33.725 --> 29:36.307
Let's go, Ms. Durst.
Wait! Stop!

29:36.308 --> 29:39.890
You... listen to me!
I wasn't in the bar
last night.

29:39.891 --> 29:43.307
Someone took my badge.
They're... they're
pretending to be me.

29:43.308 --> 29:46.682
See? The conference,
they gave me this

29:46.683 --> 29:48.724
because my badge was stolen.

29:48.725 --> 29:50.432
That's the person
you should be
looking for.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.057
They're impersonating me!

29:52.058 --> 29:53.640
I'm not with your conference.

29:53.641 --> 29:56.015
I'm with the hotel.
You signed the code
of conduct.

29:56.016 --> 29:58.682
You broke it.
We want you out.
Let's go.

29:58.683 --> 30:00.724
You can't
do this! I didn't do
anything wrong!

30:00.725 --> 30:04.682
I have... I have a panel
in a few hours!

30:04.683 --> 30:07.474
If we see you
on these premises again,
we're gonna call the police.

30:24.433 --> 30:25.933
Morning.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.682
Thanks for printing those out.

31:09.683 --> 31:12.390
Um, I lost my ID
at a conference.

31:12.391 --> 31:13.974
I have to get back
for a panel I'm on.

31:13.975 --> 31:17.683
I work for
the Department of
Sudden Departures.

31:23.225 --> 31:26.100
This is good.

31:50.225 --> 31:53.640
So, Nora Durst,
what are you doing
back in my hotel

31:53.641 --> 31:57.640
with a fake credential
and a gun?

31:57.641 --> 32:00.807
That's not for...
I forgot I had that with me.

32:00.808 --> 32:02.975
I am supposed to be
on a panel this morning.

32:05.058 --> 32:07.057
So, why did you throw a bottle

32:07.058 --> 32:08.265
at the mirror behind
the hotel bar?

32:08.266 --> 32:10.682
I wasn't in the bar.

32:10.683 --> 32:13.682
Someone is impersonating me.

32:13.683 --> 32:16.599
No offense,
but who would want
to pretend to be you?

32:16.600 --> 32:19.015
I don't know.
There are a lot
of sick people out there.

32:19.016 --> 32:22.640
Maybe somebody's doing it
for attention. I...

32:22.641 --> 32:25.640
My husband and two children
are... departed,

32:25.641 --> 32:27.766
and that sort of thing,
it gets a lot of sympathy.

32:31.308 --> 32:33.600
Jesus, your whole family?

32:34.350 --> 32:37.015
What are the odds?

32:37.016 --> 32:39.850
One in 128,000.

32:44.225 --> 32:46.224
OK, let's try this on for size.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.265
I know how these
conferences can be.

32:48.266 --> 32:51.224
Away from home, new people.

32:51.225 --> 32:53.599
So maybe things got out of hand,

32:53.600 --> 32:55.224
- one drink too many...
- No...

32:55.225 --> 32:56.599
No, no...
Listen to me.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.599
Maybe you did go
down to that bar

33:00.600 --> 33:01.849
and things got out of control.

33:01.850 --> 33:05.265
Maybe you've been
under a lot of stress

33:05.266 --> 33:08.599
and you just...

33:08.600 --> 33:10.265
lost your grip on things.

33:10.266 --> 33:13.265
Is that possible?

33:13.266 --> 33:15.640
No, that is not possible.

33:15.641 --> 33:16.849
Please, just...

33:16.850 --> 33:20.599
She is probably
on my panel right now.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.807
The other panelists
don't know me.

33:22.808 --> 33:26.015
She could walk onstage
with my badge and nobody
would stop her,

33:26.016 --> 33:28.433
so please!

33:33.391 --> 33:35.599
All right.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.974
If I walk you down
to that conference room

33:37.975 --> 33:40.557
and there's no one there
pretending to be you,

33:40.558 --> 33:44.640
then you leave this hotel
and I never see your face
again. Deal?

33:44.641 --> 33:46.141
Deal.

33:56.183 --> 33:58.182
I'm sorry. The session's
already started.

33:58.183 --> 33:59.849
We're just gonna be a minute.

33:59.850 --> 34:01.807
Next we have
Marquee Jackson
from Vermont.

34:01.808 --> 34:04.765
Beside him, we have
Olivia Livingstone

34:04.766 --> 34:06.765
from the Rhode Island
branch of the DSD,

34:06.766 --> 34:08.849
which has the highest
participation rate

34:08.850 --> 34:11.474
in the benefit program
in the country.

34:11.475 --> 34:14.474
Next, we have
Jonathan Van Meter,
also from Vermont,

34:14.475 --> 34:17.931
and beside him,
Nora Durst from New York.

34:17.933 --> 34:20.391
Mrs. Durst is also
a triple legacy.

34:21.891 --> 34:23.224
Well, fuck.

34:23.225 --> 34:26.264
I need two guys
to the Waterloo
Room right now.

34:26.266 --> 34:29.639
...Pritcher,
liaison with the Canadian
Departure Census,

34:29.641 --> 34:32.764
and he'll talk
about how they collect
their data up north.

34:32.766 --> 34:35.556
And finally, Daniel McCallum
from Connecticut.

34:35.558 --> 34:37.724
Daniel served on
the Review Committee...

34:37.725 --> 34:41.139
Excuse me!
I have a question.

34:41.141 --> 34:42.599
Uh, we haven't started
the panel yet...

34:42.600 --> 34:45.014
I have a question
for Nora Durst.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.014
We will open the floor
to questions...

34:47.016 --> 34:49.224
I am not Nora Durst.

34:51.808 --> 34:53.764
I have been watching you people

34:53.766 --> 34:57.182
for the last two days,
listening to you,

34:57.183 --> 34:59.557
and you are all blind.

34:59.558 --> 35:01.515
Puppets.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.932
Ma'am.
The Department
of the Sudden Departure

35:03.933 --> 35:06.640
is an elaborate smokescreen
to give the public

35:06.641 --> 35:07.183
the illusion of progress.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

35:07.184 --> 35:09.349
Excuse me.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.515
Their questionnaires
are sent to incinerators

35:11.516 --> 35:12.849
outside of Tallahassee, Florida.

35:12.850 --> 35:15.140
Shut this off!
Their benefit payments

35:15.141 --> 35:16.932
are a way to silence us all.

35:16.933 --> 35:20.390
In 2005, the Israeli
Mossad was experimenting

35:20.391 --> 35:21.974
with a plasma ray
that could target

35:21.975 --> 35:25.724
all human matter and
leave almost no residue.

35:25.725 --> 35:29.849
Where are your experts
and panels on that?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.807
Another martini, dirty.

35:45.808 --> 35:47.974
Thank you.
Let me give you my card.
You can keep it open.

35:47.975 --> 35:50.683
Manager says
whatever you need,
it's on the house.

35:53.183 --> 35:56.515
What'd they do,

35:56.516 --> 35:57.765
if the drinks are on them

35:57.766 --> 36:00.349
because you've been
seriously wronged?

36:00.350 --> 36:04.515
Maybe they're just
rewarding me for being
a loyal customer.

36:04.516 --> 36:06.515
Nah.
Nah?

36:06.516 --> 36:09.140
Isn't the way the world works.

36:09.141 --> 36:11.515
Indeed it is not.
Heh heh!

36:11.516 --> 36:12.765
I'm sorry to interrupt.

36:12.766 --> 36:15.557
Would you mind
signing this for me?

36:15.558 --> 36:17.140
Oh, absolutely.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.182
Should I make it out to anyone?

36:19.183 --> 36:20.974
To Gail.
To Gail. Sure.

36:20.975 --> 36:22.891
Please.
No problem.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.182
God Bless.

36:26.183 --> 36:27.724
Heh heh! Thank you.

36:27.725 --> 36:29.683
Take care.

36:31.183 --> 36:32.432
What?

36:32.433 --> 36:34.099
I hear it's amazing,

36:34.100 --> 36:36.432
your book.

36:36.433 --> 36:38.432
Ah, the writing's
so-so.

36:38.433 --> 36:40.474
People respond to the idea.

36:40.475 --> 36:43.350
Why no question mark?

36:44.850 --> 36:47.057
"What's Next," period.

36:47.058 --> 36:49.849
I mean, no offense,
but it's not like
you know what's next.

36:49.850 --> 36:51.765
Exactly. No one knows.

36:51.766 --> 36:55.932
But we can't spend our lives
waiting around for something
that may never come.

36:55.933 --> 36:59.224
Back.

36:59.225 --> 37:00.682
Sorry?

37:00.683 --> 37:03.225
Something that may
never come back.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.807
You lost someone?

37:10.808 --> 37:13.225
I did.

37:16.308 --> 37:17.890
You know,
my daughter... ahem...

37:17.891 --> 37:20.682
about a year ago,
she was out in
our backyard,

37:20.683 --> 37:22.349
chasing around some
of her friends,

37:22.350 --> 37:25.890
and she was laughing.

37:25.891 --> 37:29.890
Then she saw me
watching her and she
looked guilty,

37:29.891 --> 37:33.141
like she wasn't sure
if it was OK
to be happy.

37:35.225 --> 37:38.890
But this, what we've
experienced...

37:38.891 --> 37:41.265
it isn't grief.

37:41.266 --> 37:43.766
It's never-ending.

37:45.266 --> 37:48.182
Ambiguous loss.

37:48.183 --> 37:52.890
If my 8-year-old can
find happiness within,

37:52.891 --> 37:55.433
why can't the rest of us?

37:59.141 --> 38:00.765
Bullshit.

38:00.766 --> 38:02.557
I'm sorry?

38:02.558 --> 38:04.390
No, you're not sorry.

38:04.391 --> 38:06.515
Sorry people don't write
fucking books.

38:06.516 --> 38:09.682
Wait a minute.
Ma'am, if I've offended you
in any way, that was not my...

38:09.683 --> 38:11.265
"Ambiguous loss"?

38:11.266 --> 38:14.224
What is ambiguous about
your family being gone?

38:14.225 --> 38:16.974
Well, and you
must know because
you lost what, 4?

38:16.975 --> 38:20.057
You count your parents
in that? What were they,
in their 70s?

38:20.058 --> 38:23.765
You sit there
and tell me a story
about your daughter.

38:23.766 --> 38:26.390
I lost everyone.

38:26.391 --> 38:30.849
I lost everything.
You fucking fraud!

38:30.850 --> 38:33.432
You fucking liar!
You're not in pain!

38:33.433 --> 38:36.849
Because if you were
in pain, you would know
there is no moving on!

38:36.850 --> 38:39.265
There is no happiness!
What's next?

38:39.266 --> 38:41.265
What's fucking next?!

38:41.266 --> 38:43.265
Nothing is next!

38:43.266 --> 38:45.391
Nothing!

39:12.016 --> 39:14.349
Evening.

39:18.975 --> 39:20.349
Excuse me.

39:20.350 --> 39:22.599
Excuse me. Excuse me.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.849
Miss, miss, miss.
I'm sorry to bother you.

39:25.850 --> 39:27.557
I saw you back in the bar
and I heard what you said.

39:27.558 --> 39:29.557
And I just wanted to ask you,

39:29.558 --> 39:31.640
do you want to feel this way?

39:31.641 --> 39:33.765
Yeah, I want to feel this way.

39:33.766 --> 39:34.974
Fuck off.

39:34.975 --> 39:37.932
You're right,
you know, about Johansen.

39:37.933 --> 39:40.099
What?
Excuse me.

39:40.100 --> 39:43.182
He's not in pain.
He's a fraud,
just like you said,

39:43.183 --> 39:45.058
and I can prove it.

39:48.141 --> 39:49.641
How?

40:24.516 --> 40:26.016
Come on.

41:13.183 --> 41:14.724
This is Ray.

41:14.725 --> 41:17.308
He'll take
your payment
information.

41:18.766 --> 41:20.682
Payment for what?

41:20.683 --> 41:21.890
Oh, last year Patrick Johansen,

41:21.891 --> 41:25.474
he walked
through doorways
just like that.

41:25.475 --> 41:28.350
If you want to know
what happened,
it's $1,000.

41:31.558 --> 41:34.390
What do you mean,
"what happened"?

41:34.391 --> 41:36.390
You on PayPal?

41:36.391 --> 41:39.225
If not, I can get you set up.

41:45.725 --> 41:47.682
I have an account.

41:47.683 --> 41:50.307
Go ahead and pull it up.

41:50.308 --> 41:52.808
You authorize the amount.

42:12.183 --> 42:13.432
Thank you.

42:13.433 --> 42:16.683
Now right this way.

42:18.183 --> 42:20.308
Go ahead.

42:22.975 --> 42:25.100
Come on.

42:44.933 --> 42:46.890
This is Wayne.

42:46.891 --> 42:48.766
Holy Wayne.

42:56.100 --> 42:58.682
Mmm, I don't think
she's heard of me.

42:58.683 --> 43:01.807
No, she's here
about Patrick Johansen.

43:01.808 --> 43:04.099
Who?

43:04.100 --> 43:07.307
The one who came to you
just before you left
for the ranch?

43:07.308 --> 43:10.849
Lost most of his family?

43:10.850 --> 43:13.349
He ended up
writing a book?
Oh, right.

43:13.350 --> 43:16.015
Right. I didn't read it.

43:16.016 --> 43:19.516
I assume he didn't mention me.

43:22.725 --> 43:25.266
Why would he mention you?

43:26.725 --> 43:30.058
Because I took
his pain from him.

43:38.391 --> 43:40.516
What are you doing?

43:41.891 --> 43:43.974
What's your name, love?

43:43.975 --> 43:47.349
Nora.
Nora.

43:47.350 --> 43:49.349
Nora, I don't give
a shit about you.

43:49.350 --> 43:52.724
I've already got your money,
and I'm fucking exhausted.

43:52.725 --> 43:54.808
You've lost someone, yes?

43:59.933 --> 44:01.725
Someones.

44:07.100 --> 44:11.266
And you believe
that you will always
feel that pain.

44:12.725 --> 44:16.349
And if it starts
to slip away, you...

44:16.350 --> 44:19.641
you seek it out
again, don't you?

44:21.350 --> 44:23.182
You won't let it kill you,

44:23.183 --> 44:26.557
but you won't...

44:26.558 --> 44:28.557
kill yourself.

44:31.808 --> 44:35.224
For whoever is joined
with all of the living,

44:35.225 --> 44:38.141
there is hope.

44:39.641 --> 44:40.849
Surely,

44:40.850 --> 44:44.766
a live dog is better
than a dead lion.

44:47.016 --> 44:48.016
Hope.

44:50.641 --> 44:53.182
It's your weakness.

44:53.183 --> 44:57.349
You want it gone
because you don't
deserve it.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.390
Nora...

45:04.391 --> 45:08.266
you do deserve hope.

45:13.766 --> 45:17.765
I've seen my own death,
and it's coming upon me
very soon,

45:17.766 --> 45:20.182
so this is
your one chance,
your only chance,

45:20.183 --> 45:23.557
and the question
remains the same.

45:23.558 --> 45:27.100
Do you want to feel this way?

45:30.058 --> 45:31.682
No.

45:31.683 --> 45:33.557
No.

45:40.141 --> 45:43.058
Then let me take it from you.

45:53.183 --> 45:54.641
Will I forget them?

45:57.933 --> 46:00.350
Never.

47:15.058 --> 47:17.015
You have a rewards card with us?

47:17.016 --> 47:19.140
Sure, I got it right here.

47:20.766 --> 47:22.140
Thanks.

47:22.141 --> 47:23.641
All right.

47:39.433 --> 47:41.432
Hello, you've
reached the Durst residence.
Please leave a message.

47:41.433 --> 47:44.849
Nora.

47:44.850 --> 47:47.432
Hi, uh, it's Matt.

47:47.433 --> 47:51.057
I know I keep calling.
I should just...

47:51.058 --> 47:55.807
I don't know
how many different ways
I can apologize. I...

47:55.808 --> 47:57.515
I've made some changes
in my life.

47:57.516 --> 48:01.725
I see things more clearly now.

48:03.225 --> 48:04.432
We're family.

48:04.433 --> 48:07.765
I love you.

48:07.766 --> 48:10.725
Message saved.

48:24.850 --> 48:25.890
Hey.

48:25.891 --> 48:28.474
Hi.

48:28.475 --> 48:31.515
I, uh... looked up
your address.

48:31.516 --> 48:34.557
Actually easier to get
than your phone number,
believe it or not.

48:34.558 --> 48:35.724
Oh, did you want
to come in or...

48:35.725 --> 48:39.307
No, actually,
I'm on duty. I, uh...

48:39.308 --> 48:43.682
just wanted to stop by
and tell you I don't
take it personally.

48:43.683 --> 48:47.265
You know,
when you said, uh,
"Fuck your daughter."

48:47.266 --> 48:49.890
I was having an off day.

48:49.891 --> 48:51.849
Divorces will do that to you.

48:51.850 --> 48:55.307
They will.

48:55.308 --> 48:58.849
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know that I want to
get out here all the time,

48:58.850 --> 49:02.849
just go, but when you said that

49:02.850 --> 49:05.808
about Miami,
it sounded pretty good.

49:06.516 --> 49:09.765
Maybe we should, um...

49:09.766 --> 49:14.182
do dinner or something
first sometime?

49:14.183 --> 49:16.640
I would love that.

49:16.641 --> 49:17.766
Good.

49:20.225 --> 49:21.849
All right.

49:21.850 --> 49:24.265
But you should
know, though,
I'm a fuckin' mess.

49:24.266 --> 49:25.266
Thanks for the heads-up.
All right.

49:25.267 --> 49:27.682
Bye.

49:27.683 --> 49:28.975
Bye.

49:34.391 --> 49:36.765
To your knowledge,
did the Departed

49:36.766 --> 49:38.807
regularly use aerosol hair spray

49:38.808 --> 49:41.140
and/or deodorant?

49:41.141 --> 49:42.641
Yeah, I think so.

49:45.475 --> 49:49.307
In your opinion,
was the Departed
a charitable person?

49:49.308 --> 49:51.433
Yes.

49:54.475 --> 49:57.307
In your opinion,
was the Departed
a religious person?

49:57.308 --> 49:58.808
Yes.

50:05.475 --> 50:09.808
In your opinion, do you
believe the Departed is
in a better place?

50:20.350 --> 50:21.932
No.
