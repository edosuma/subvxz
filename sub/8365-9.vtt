00:01.802 --> 00:04.770
(Doors creak, thud)

00:04.772 --> 00:07.673
- Well, how's that for timing!
- What do you mean?

00:07.675 --> 00:10.576
- We both stepped out
exactly together.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.544
- We didn't time this.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.279
- I know we didn't time it.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.049
- What's your point?
- That is my point!

00:17.051 --> 00:18.984
- We-we both stepped out,

00:18.986 --> 00:20.953
and we didn't know the other
person was stepping out,

00:20.955 --> 00:22.788
at exactly the same time!

00:22.790 --> 00:24.323
- Yeah, why are you yelling
at me right now?

00:24.325 --> 00:26.525
- Well, I'm just explaining
the good timing of this,

00:26.527 --> 00:28.293
when no explanation is needed.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.863
It's just, it's the good
timing, it's...

00:30.865 --> 00:34.400
- Okay fine, I don't get it,
but, whatever.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.770
Oh my God, is that David?

00:37.772 --> 00:39.705
(Car rumbles)

00:42.443 --> 00:44.543
- Oh...

00:44.545 --> 00:45.978
Oh, hey.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.447
- David, where did you get
this car?

00:48.449 --> 00:50.315
- Oh, this car was paid for
by my employer.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.785
We felt I needed a more
efficient way to get to work.

00:52.787 --> 00:54.787
- So she bought you a car?!

00:54.789 --> 00:57.189
- It's a rental.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.891
Do you think I'd allow someone
to buy that car for me?

00:58.893 --> 01:00.592
- Well, this-this is so great.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.261
- Thank God we have
a car again!

01:02.263 --> 01:04.997
- Um, very unclear on the "we"
part of that sentence.

01:04.999 --> 01:06.465
- Yeah, your brother's
right, Alexis,

01:06.467 --> 01:08.200
this is his car, not ours.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.636
We don't have a car,
and he does.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.638
- Okay, are you okay?

01:12.640 --> 01:15.307
- Yes, yes, I-I'm just happy

01:15.309 --> 01:17.876
the Roses are moving up
in the world.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.878
- There's a button missing
on your jacket.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.980
- What?
- Oh ew, you poor thing.

01:23.350 --> 01:27.619
♪ ♪

01:29.056 --> 01:30.989
JOHNNY: Are those turkey
sausages?

01:30.991 --> 01:33.625
- Yes.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.562
- Well, maybe, maybe I'll just
sample one.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.097
- Okay.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.065
- Everything okay over here?

01:40.067 --> 01:42.267
- Yes it is, Twyla.
Just great.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.470
If uh, if you could add
this to our tab,

01:44.472 --> 01:46.038
that would be wonderful.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.574
- Add it to your tab.
Yeah, um...

01:48.576 --> 01:51.243
- What, is there a problem?

01:51.245 --> 01:54.780
- Unfortunately, we can't put
any more on your tab, Mr. Rose.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.515
We have a limit as to how much
you can charge on it

01:56.517 --> 01:59.618
without actually making
any effort to pay.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.521
- Oh, I see.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.790
- So, here's your bill.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.359
- Okay, thank you. Just uh...

02:07.361 --> 02:10.462
Leave this with me, Twyla,
and I'll take care of it um...

02:10.464 --> 02:13.031
this afternoon, or... tomorrow.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.334
- This afternoon
would be great.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.870
- Well then, this afternoon
it is!

02:17.872 --> 02:20.372
And If not, then you know,
tomorrow.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.274
- Morning.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.676
- Morning. Tomorrow morning.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.678
Thank you!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.349
ALEXIS: Um, what is going on?

02:30.351 --> 02:32.217
- Oh, nothing, nothing.
Nothing's going on.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.520
It's just I've gotta move
some money around,

02:34.522 --> 02:36.989
make sure things are... liquid.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.391
- How much trouble are we in?
- Who said we're in trouble?

02:39.393 --> 02:40.959
- I have dated enough
Wall Street losers

02:40.961 --> 02:43.962
to know that "making things
liquid" is not a good thing!

02:43.964 --> 02:45.864
- No, no, we're fine.
We're fine, honey.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.168
No, no, I just had to use my
unemployment cheque this month

02:49.170 --> 02:53.438
to pay for all the raw milk
that "we" ordered.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.374
- Okay...

02:55.376 --> 02:58.043
Um, well like, what can I do?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.412
- Just don't tell your mother,
okay?

03:00.414 --> 03:01.747
Or your brother, I mean,

03:01.749 --> 03:03.582
they're too fragile
to handle this.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.451
And no one really needs
to worry.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.888
- Well, you might wanna tell
that to your face.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.596
(Birds chirp)

03:19.500 --> 03:21.667
- Oh you are here,
thank goodness!

03:21.669 --> 03:25.337
Stevie, does this computer
get internet access?

03:25.339 --> 03:27.439
- It does.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.442
- Please log on immediately.

03:30.444 --> 03:35.414
- Okay...
- Jocelyn has made allusions to certain...

03:35.416 --> 03:38.016
sensitive photographs
from my past.

03:38.018 --> 03:41.153
- Uh, are you sure you don't
want me to just leave you

03:41.155 --> 03:42.654
to do this on your own?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.089
- No, I can't type,

03:44.091 --> 03:46.992
and I don't care to relive
my days as a secretary.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.860
- Oh... Okay.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.629
Uh, just give me a minute,

03:50.631 --> 03:54.366
because we're only one small
step above dial up here.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.602
- It's hardly surprising
that Jocelyn

03:56.604 --> 03:58.570
would suddenly uncover these
in the middle

03:58.572 --> 04:01.406
of a political campaign.

04:03.210 --> 04:07.479
I suppose I just expected
more from her.

04:07.481 --> 04:11.416
- Okay, there's a bunch
of you with O.J. Simpson.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.487
And you with Robert Blake.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.723
- "The Top Eleven Photographs
of Moira Rose

04:17.725 --> 04:19.891
with Future Murder Suspects."

04:19.893 --> 04:22.394
Well, that's not
what I'm looking for!

04:22.396 --> 04:24.329
- Why were you in a paddle boat
with Phil Spector?

04:24.331 --> 04:26.198
- And doesn't he looks good?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.467
That was the one time he let me
play with his hair.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.135
It was a sunny aft-- you know,

04:30.137 --> 04:31.937
I shouldn't have
to explain myself.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.973
- Okay well, there's a bunch
here that could qualify

04:34.975 --> 04:37.542
as incriminating, so...

04:37.544 --> 04:40.279
- Okay.

04:40.281 --> 04:44.016
I did a series of very
tasteful nudes

04:44.018 --> 04:47.986
with Richard Avedon in the 70's.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.255
- I see. Um...

04:50.257 --> 04:53.058
This is really not
in my job description so--

04:53.060 --> 04:54.726
- Why aren't they coming up?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.495
What, do you have some kind
of childproof lock

04:56.497 --> 04:58.130
on this internet?

04:58.132 --> 05:00.832
- Hm, nope, that would make
my job very boring.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.567
- Oh, keep scrolling, please.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.638
ALEXIS: See David, this is what
happens when you wash your face

05:06.640 --> 05:09.041
with a bar of motel hand soap!

05:09.043 --> 05:11.576
- It's a zit. People get zits.

05:11.578 --> 05:14.680
I mean, I've always had
clean, radiant skin,

05:14.682 --> 05:16.081
but I'm an anomaly.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.516
- It's not a zit, David.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.085
I think it's just my anxiety
clogging up my pores.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.154
- And forming zits.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.823
- Oh! Ohhh my God, no!

05:24.825 --> 05:27.526
- What is going on with you?!
- I need to save this!

05:27.528 --> 05:29.728
- Wait, you're gonna put
that on your face,

05:29.730 --> 05:31.129
after it's been on the floor?

05:31.131 --> 05:32.564
I don't even wear good socks
in here!

05:32.566 --> 05:34.066
- Okay, there are things
going on right now

05:34.068 --> 05:35.701
that you don't know about.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.339
- Like what?

05:36.365 --> 05:38.637
- Like things I that
can't talk about, okay?!

05:38.639 --> 05:40.539
- I know about your dandruff
shampoo.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.973
- That is preventative,

05:41.975 --> 05:43.408
and that is not what
I'm talking about!

help me please?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.314

05:49.316 --> 05:52.651

MOIRA: David, it's urgent!

05:52.653 --> 05:55.020
- What is it?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.722
(Groans)

05:58.125 --> 05:59.991
- Darling, I'm afraid
you and I have arrived

05:59.993 --> 06:04.830
at an awkward moment in our
parent/child relationship.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.632
- I'd argue that moment
happens daily.

06:07.634 --> 06:11.336
- It seems that there are some
nude photographs of me

06:11.338 --> 06:12.704
on the internet--
- Oh!

06:12.706 --> 06:14.973
- and I would like you
to search for them.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.675
- That's a real quick no.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.311
Um, you can ask literally
anyone else.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.979
- No, I tried to ask Stevie,

06:20.981 --> 06:23.048
but her computer
is several years old,

06:23.050 --> 06:25.484
and apparently quite prudish.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.486
If someone has to find
naked pictures of me,

06:27.488 --> 06:30.288
better you than a stranger
in a storm cellar!

06:30.290 --> 06:32.357
- Is it though?
- What's going on?

06:32.359 --> 06:34.926
- There are nude photos of me
all over the internet.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.229
- Um, are you sure you're not
thinking of mine?

06:37.231 --> 06:39.531
- Nothing's coming up.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.833
- What search words did you use?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.136
- Uh, your name, and "nude."

06:44.138 --> 06:45.937
Three words I thought
I'd only have to type

06:45.939 --> 06:47.973
if I was held at gunpoint.

06:47.975 --> 06:51.443
- Okay, try "effervescence."

No, I'm sorry, "small umbrella."

There was nothing.

so we can then get rid of them!

07:09.430 --> 07:11.663
Honestly!

09:33.674 --> 09:35.240
- Mhmm.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.312
- You know it's funny,

09:40.314 --> 09:43.148
It didn't seem that long ago that you
were relying on me for everything.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.550
Like when you were taking
your harpsichord lessons,

09:45.552 --> 09:48.119
and I would drive you.
- I was seven.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.121
- All the lessons
that I paid for,

09:50.123 --> 09:52.457
and schooling--
- Okay, What is happening here?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.926
- Nothing, nothing, I'm having
a little chat with my son,

09:54.928 --> 09:56.328
that's all, do I have
to pay for that?

09:56.330 --> 09:58.763
Last I heard, you didn't
have to pay--

09:58.765 --> 10:01.066
- You and Alexis, I've been
getting some very weird vibes.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.500
- What did Alexis say?
What did she say?!

10:02.502 --> 10:04.169
- Well, she- she didn't
say anything.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.004
Should she have said something?
- No, no.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.506
- What is going on?!
- It's...

10:10.243 --> 10:13.979
I've over extended a little
bit this month.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.282
Financially, I-I could use
some gap financing,

10:17.284 --> 10:19.284
that's all.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.952
- Well, should I be concerned?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.288
- No, no.
- Well, how bad is it?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.390
- It's pretty bad,
it's pretty bad,

10:25.392 --> 10:27.959
and you know, this is so
awkward for a father

10:27.961 --> 10:30.362
to come to a son for money.
- Well, believe it or not,

10:30.364 --> 10:31.963
this is actually not
the most awkward

10:31.965 --> 10:36.534
parent/son request
I've gotten today, so...

10:36.536 --> 10:41.706
If you need money,
I can give you money.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.412
- Well, thank you, David.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.681
- So...

10:49.683 --> 10:52.617
Oh my God! What are you doing?

10:52.619 --> 10:55.020
- Well, I was trying
to give you a hug.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.755
- I-I get the gesture.
- I should've undone the seatbelt.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.556
- Okay, well then, let's just
leave it at a gesture.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.225
- Okay, let's just leave it.
- Um yeah, let's leave it.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.359
- High five, son.
- Uh well, okay, okay. - All right, okay.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.565
ALEXIS: So I've been thinking
about your job posting,

11:07.567 --> 11:10.201
and I have decided
that I am interested.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.736
- Great!

11:11.738 --> 11:13.405
- But I would like
to interview for it.

11:13.407 --> 11:14.806
Just like everybody else.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.441
- Are you sure about that?

11:16.443 --> 11:17.942
Because I already offered
you the job.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.445
- No I know, I just, I don't
want any special treatment.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.747
And it's really important to me

11:22.749 --> 11:24.516
that I feel like I really
earned this.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.452
- Okay, uh, have a seat.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.120
- Okay.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.358
Okay...

11:35.362 --> 11:37.095
- Ahem!

11:37.097 --> 11:39.130
Okay! So...

11:39.132 --> 11:41.132
- Just... a second.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.104
Okay.
- Okay.

11:46.106 --> 11:49.007
Have you ever worked
as a receptionist before?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.408
- That would be a no,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.610
But I have dealt with a lot
of receptionists before,

11:52.612 --> 11:54.946
and so I feel like I have
the right temperament for it.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.182
- Okay, and how are your
typing skills?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.551
- Well, you've seen me text.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.888
- Mhmm... And how are you
at spreadsheets?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.390
- Okay, I'm just gonna stop you
right there.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.158
I'm loving this Q and A,

12:07.160 --> 12:09.127
but I think what's important
right now,

12:09.129 --> 12:11.529
is my positive attitude.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.131
And I don't wanna brag,

12:13.133 --> 12:17.535
but "Us Weekly" once described
me as "up for anything."

12:17.537 --> 12:19.904
So...
- O-kay.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.740
Yeah, great.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.542
Well, I think that's all the
information that I need for now,

12:24.544 --> 12:27.479
So thank you very much
for your time,

12:27.481 --> 12:29.347
and I will be in touch.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.450
- Thank you very much
for your time.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.186
Did I get the job?
- Yeah, yes. You got the job.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.322
- Okay! Okay.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.723
You're a really good actor.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.158
- (Laughs) Thanks.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.559
- You're welcome.

12:46.633 --> 12:50.101
MOIRA: Stevie, I knew I could
trust you to find them.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.469
STEVIE: The only thing is,
if you want me to print it,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.738
our printer's not working.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.373
- Oh dear.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.642
- Yeah, all those online
perverts should be put

12:57.644 --> 12:59.844
in a paddle boat,
and sent out to sea.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.147
- No, that's not me.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.548
- That's your face.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.683
- Yes, it's my character
from "Sunrise Bay,"

13:05.685 --> 13:08.286
but it's been put on the body
of what I can only assume

13:08.288 --> 13:10.622
is an Indonesian lady boy.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.557
- Ohhh!

13:12.559 --> 13:15.760
- I thought maybe you just
had a tan.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.896
- So this is it.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.597
- Yeah, I think so.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.699
Um, I would really rather not
dive any deeper.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.301
- No, it's not necessary.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.236
- Because I ended up in some
really scary, dark places

13:25.238 --> 13:29.374
of the internet that I would
rather not revisit, so...

13:29.376 --> 13:33.845
- I am suddenly overwhelmed
with regret.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.413
It's a new feeling for me,

13:35.415 --> 13:38.683
and I don't find it
at all pleasurable.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.986
- You regret that embarrassing
photos of you aren't online?

13:41.988 --> 13:45.323
- No, I regret that
they're lost.

13:45.325 --> 13:49.761
They were the one perfect
memorial to who I once was.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.999
And I should've appreciated
those firm round mammae,

13:55.001 --> 13:58.169
and callipygian ass,
while I had them.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.138
- If you're talking about
your body, uh...

14:00.140 --> 14:03.007
I think you still look amazing.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.679
- Then allow me to offer you
some advice.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.616
Take a thousand naked pictures
of yourself now.

14:12.986 --> 14:16.754
You may currently think,
"oh, I'm too spooky."

14:16.756 --> 14:19.958
Or, "nobody wants to see
these tiny boobies."

14:19.960 --> 14:23.661
But believe me, one day
you will look at those photos,

14:23.663 --> 14:25.763
with much kinder eyes and say,

14:25.765 --> 14:29.767
"dear God, I was a beautiful
thing!"

14:29.769 --> 14:32.470
- Will I?
- Mhmm.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.476
- Oh, and make sure you submit
those photos to the internet.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.179
Otherwise, your own children
will go looking for them one day

14:41.181 --> 14:45.183
and tragically,
they won't be there.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.653
- Okay, so how much money
do you need?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.054
And please keep in mind that

14:50.056 --> 14:51.823
I had a negative balance
in there last week.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.591
- Yeah, whatever you can spare.

14:53.593 --> 14:57.328
You know, a couple hundred,
Three...

14:57.330 --> 14:57.837
Four--

14:57.863 --> 14:59.864
- Okay, how much do you
actually need, though?

14:59.866 --> 15:03.134
- $560.00

15:03.136 --> 15:05.803
- So my entire paycheque, then.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.640
Okay.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.243
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.212
- It says there's an error
with your PIN.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.180
- I can see that! I can see that!
- All right.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.548
- All right, calm down, calm down.
- I can see that!

15:17.550 --> 15:19.083
- You only get a few
chances here.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.718
- I just must've typed in
the PIN number wrong.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.587
- It's actually just "PIN,"
you don't have to say,

15:22.589 --> 15:23.433
"PIN number," that's redundant.

15:23.459 --> 15:24.822
- Okay, okay, wow, are you
doing this right now?!

15:24.824 --> 15:26.591
- Sorry, sorry, sorry,
go ahead.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.693
(Buttons beep)

15:28.695 --> 15:30.528
(Whirs)

15:30.530 --> 15:31.896
- What is going on?!

15:31.898 --> 15:33.698
- All right, first of all,
just stop for one second,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.833
because you've only got one
more chance at this, all right?

15:35.835 --> 15:37.535
So focus on the numbers!

15:37.537 --> 15:38.970
- I know my number!

15:38.972 --> 15:41.339
It's the same PIN number
that I've had for years!

15:41.341 --> 15:42.774
- The same "PIN!"

15:42.776 --> 15:44.709
- Okay, can you just take a-
take a big step!

15:44.711 --> 15:45.535
Thank you so much!

15:45.561 --> 15:47.178
- All right, remember,
this is your last chance!

15:47.180 --> 15:48.546
- Arghhh!

15:48.548 --> 15:50.915
(Button beep)

15:50.917 --> 15:52.283
(Machine beeps)

15:52.285 --> 15:54.319
- What just happened?
- Well, it ate my card.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.087
- Well, press eject!
- There's no eject on this machine!

15:56.089 --> 15:58.023
- Well, what this?
There's eject.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.498
- That's "cancel," that
doesn't do anything!

15:59.524 --> 16:00.491
- All right, press
the green one!

16:00.493 --> 16:02.226
- I'm pressing "cancel,"
okay, nothing happens!

16:02.228 --> 16:03.995
- Well, press something else!
- What do you want me to do?!

16:03.997 --> 16:04.762
- Get the card back!
- We can't get the card back! - Why?

16:04.764 --> 16:06.631
(Tapping)

16:08.601 --> 16:10.168
- Wow!

16:10.170 --> 16:11.669
- So I was able to retrieve it,

16:11.671 --> 16:13.338
and it looks like this
is a new card.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.139
- Thank you, yeah,
it is a new card.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.574
- Did you use the proper PIN?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.343
- Yeah, that's what
I asked him.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.911
- Of course I used
the proper PIN.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.547
- I know my PIN number,
it's my birthday.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.349
- Happy Birthday!

16:24.351 --> 16:26.117
- No, the PIN number
is my birthday.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.518
- He keeps saying PIN number.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.687
- Did you start with the
temporary PIN that we sent you?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.122
- What? What temporary PIN?

16:31.124 --> 16:33.658
- Ah, see?
- No "see!"

16:33.660 --> 16:35.159
- None of that, listen!

16:35.161 --> 16:37.996
I phoned someone here,
a teller, I think,

16:37.998 --> 16:41.432
who told me that I didn't need
a temporary PIN number!

16:41.434 --> 16:42.900
- Oh, which teller?

16:42.902 --> 16:44.902
Because it's only me
and Carol here.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.073
- It was a while ago.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.209
- It says the account
was opened last week.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.011
- Okay, I just need to take out
some money for my dad.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.047
Um, because my family
is in debt.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.750
So if you could help me
help him,

17:00.253 --> 17:02.220
that would be a wonderful thing.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.489
- Of course, I just need you
to pick a new PIN.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.457
- Okay.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.260
It's 7-2-8-3.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.162
- Sir, you just said
your PIN out loud.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.830
So I suggest you pick
another one.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.333
- What about my birthday?
- No!

17:15.335 --> 17:17.668
- It's easy.
- It's not easy.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.937
- Nothing's easy about this.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.040
(Sighs) Okay, where--what?

17:23.743 --> 17:26.911
- I never saw myself having
like, a normal job.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.514
But I think it's gonna be kinda
nice to make money and stuff,

17:29.516 --> 17:32.183
and like, help out a bit more.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.352
- You're working for your ex.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.354
- David, Ted wouldn'tve
hired me

17:36.356 --> 17:37.989
if he thought it was a bad idea!

17:37.991 --> 17:40.391
- Ted also proposed
to you twice,

17:40.393 --> 17:42.326
so I'd say Ted's decision
making skills

17:42.328 --> 17:43.728
are a little suspect.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.163
- Okay, well I will
have you know

17:45.165 --> 17:46.864
that I went through the same
interview process

17:46.866 --> 17:48.399
as everybody else.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.069
He asked me several questions,
most of which I answered.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.703
- Oh my God!

17:52.705 --> 17:56.307
- Well kids, you'll never guess
what I just found outside.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.975
My button! (Laughs)

17:59.646 --> 18:01.612
Things are looking up!

18:03.149 --> 18:06.384
ALEXIS: I have something
for you.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.287
- Oh, Alexis, you didn't
have to do this.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.922
- Open it.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.924
- Oh, honey.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.495
- "My deepest condolences?"

18:21.367 --> 18:23.468
"I know things have been
tough lately,

18:23.470 --> 18:26.971
but I'm here for you,
and hope this helps.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.308
Love, Alexis."

18:31.978 --> 18:34.479
(Card and envelope rustle)

18:36.950 --> 18:39.250
Was there supposed to be
something in here?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.586
- In where?

18:41.588 --> 18:43.588
- In the card?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.423
- What do you mean?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.725
- Oh, it's just the card.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.128
- Yeah, I thought you could use
some support.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.563
So...
- Ohhh!

18:52.565 --> 18:54.866
(Alexis giggles)
- Wow!

18:54.868 --> 18:56.934
That was really beautiful.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.704
And very generous.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.640
- Thank you.
- Both my kids are generous.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.376
And I'm one very grateful dad.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.045
Very grateful.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.448
Awww!

19:10.450 --> 19:11.883
Bring it in, big guy.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.751
- Yeah, I don't know if that's
something I wanna do right now.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.586
- David, Dad's poor right now!

19:15.588 --> 19:16.954
- He's not poor anymore!

19:16.956 --> 19:19.190
Because someone gave him more
than a cheap card!

19:19.192 --> 19:22.527
- Okay, okay, that's enough.
- Okay. Oh.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.531
MOIRA: What's-what's this
about?

19:26.533 --> 19:29.467
- I was just uh... hugging
my kids.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.604
- Why?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.506
- I found my button.
- Alexis got a job.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.974
- Alexis got a job!
- Yeah.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.545
- Alexis? Oh, how wonderful!
- Yeah!

19:40.547 --> 19:43.214
- Wow Alexis, look at you!

19:43.216 --> 19:47.552
Just starting out on a shiny
new future!

19:51.824 --> 19:53.558
- Whew! Okay, good night, kids.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.959
- I'm gonna get changed.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.128
- Okay, sure.

20:02.370 --> 20:04.236
- You know, all things
considered, Moira,

20:04.238 --> 20:06.772
I'd say we have a couple
of pretty great kids.

20:06.774 --> 20:09.175
- Mhmm.

20:09.177 --> 20:10.743
They say it's through our
children that we stay young.

20:10.745 --> 20:14.046
But I haven't seen much effort
on their part.

20:14.048 --> 20:17.650
- You're still thinking about
those photos.

20:17.652 --> 20:19.351
- Oh, I can't help it, John.

20:19.353 --> 20:21.854
The last traces of my
juvenescence vanished

20:21.856 --> 20:23.255
into thin air.

20:23.257 --> 20:26.926
- Well, perhaps they're not
the last traces.

20:28.296 --> 20:30.296
- What does that mean?

20:30.298 --> 20:33.065
- Why don't you look
in my folio?

20:38.206 --> 20:40.172
Inside pocket.

20:42.510 --> 20:45.811
- (Gasps) Oh, you dirty dog!

20:45.813 --> 20:47.780
- Well, what can I say?

20:47.782 --> 20:50.683
- When did you take this?

20:50.685 --> 20:52.852
- Greece, 1987.

20:52.854 --> 20:55.221
- Oh, I loved those earrings.

20:56.624 --> 20:58.290
And that skin.

20:58.292 --> 21:00.493
And that hair.

21:00.495 --> 21:01.994
- I'm no Avedon honey,

21:01.996 --> 21:05.364
but I would say you still
look pretty spectacular.

21:06.968 --> 21:09.535
- And that's all that counts.

21:09.537 --> 21:11.070
(Kiss)

21:14.742 --> 21:19.078
Now how do I get this
on the internet? John!
