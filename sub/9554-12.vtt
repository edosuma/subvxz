03:26.139 --> 03:28.005
Potsie Weber.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.302
Hey, before you leave...

03:29.443 --> 03:31.536
Before you leave, folks,
I want to hear a special hand

03:31.678 --> 03:33.874
for our star fullback who's
gonna lead us to victory

03:34.014 --> 03:36.710
tomorrow, Mr. Rebel E. Lee.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.909
(whooping)

03:40.721 --> 03:42.245
That's-that's good, Rebel, good.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.380
Clever, good.
Okay, thank you very much.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.288
Good night, folks.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.952
Rebel, you'd better go home now.

03:49.096 --> 03:52.827
Yeah, coach says I should be
in bed by 10:00 every night.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.867
Coach says you grow
when you sleep.

03:56.002 --> 03:59.598
Rebel, we've got to have
a serious talk.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.766
It's not that I don't like you.
But, well...

04:02.909 --> 04:05.276
what would you say
if I started playing the field?

04:05.412 --> 04:06.743
I'd kill the field.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.517
Night, Kitty.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.643
Night, Reb.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.785
Kitty.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.827
Kitty, my sweet.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.938
Oh, Kitty, did you
tell Rebel about me?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.437
I tried. He won't listen.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.633
All he ever does is lift me up.

04:35.776 --> 04:40.145
Never mind, my sweet.
True love conquers all.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.181
So, uh, you girls
are studying to be nurses, huh?

04:43.316 --> 04:46.878
Want to play doctor? (chuckles)

04:47.020 --> 04:49.079
Hey, Rich, big trouble.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.553
Malph just
picked up Rebel's girl.

04:50.690 --> 04:51.885
What?

04:53.560 --> 04:55.221
He's With Kitty? (sighs)

04:55.362 --> 04:58.354
Uh, excuse us, girls.
We have to prevent a murder.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.695
Hey, Ralph.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.361
Hey, come on,
we got to talk to you.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.973
Later, boys, later.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.872
Come on, Malph, it's important.

05:10.010 --> 05:14.379
Excuse me, Kitty, I must
address the peanut gallery.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.814
Oh, Ralph, you've still got it.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.147
Not like he's gonna get it.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.716
- Excuse us. Excuse us, please.
- Excuse us, please.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.553
Boys. Bad timing.
Now, what is it?

05:26.693 --> 05:28.718
You've been dating Kitty,
Rebel's girl.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.921
Potsie, go watch
your malt curdle.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.226
Ralph, you're playing
with fire here.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.596
They recruited that guy
from the bayous, man.

05:35.735 --> 05:36.998
He used to wrestle
with alligators,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.627
and he let them start on top.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.502
Intrigue runs amok
in my family.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.541
You know, my aunt ran off
with the milkman

05:43.677 --> 05:46.669
and left the mailman
holding the bag. (cackles)

05:48.949 --> 05:50.007
Kitty.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.277
Ralphie.

05:52.419 --> 05:53.977
He's lost his mind.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.316
Worse. Now he's gonna
lose his face.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.223
RICHIE:
There go the girls.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.918
Hey, uh, Ralph, come...

06:01.061 --> 06:02.551
Richie.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.687

06:22.282 --> 06:24.148
Rich, didn't you hear me?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.446
I'm gonna smash you, Malph.

06:29.289 --> 06:32.258
Rich... Rich,
your voice has changed.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.529
Rich, your body's changed.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.894
What's your leg doing up here?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.967
(screams)

06:42.102 --> 06:43.899
You better
say your prayers, Malph.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.436
Wait a minute, Rebel,
wait a minute.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.506
It's not what you think.
What do you think?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.268
I think you're trying
to steal my girl.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.002
No, he isn't.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.272
Rebel, I-l tried
to tell you, you're nice,

06:53.413 --> 06:54.881
but I want to see Ralph.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.710
It's bigger than the both of us.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.250
He's bigger
than all three of us.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.513
Kitty, you'd better
go powder your nose.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.919
I'll set Rebel... straight.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.821
All right, Ralphie-Poo.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.722
I'll be right back.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.420
Easy, Reb.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.422
Easy, Reb.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.794
"Ralphie-Poo?"

07:13.933 --> 07:14.957
Wait a minute.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.627
Just tell me-- is Kitty gone?

07:17.771 --> 07:18.738
Yeah. Why'?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.305
Well, now we can
get down to business.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.876
Please don't hurt me, Rebel.
I don't want to die.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.410
Please.

07:25.545 --> 07:26.672
You won't die.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.804
Maybe lose a few teeth.
Or a nose.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.940
(shrieks)

07:33.787 --> 07:36.847
Rebel, please, please,
I get airsick.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.981
All right.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.858
- Fonz! Fonz!
- Get off the wall, Malph.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.021
Please, Fonz, please,
you got to save me.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.655
Rebel's gonna kill me.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.132
No, he's not gonna kill you,
'cause there's no fighting

07:49.269 --> 07:50.293
here in Arnold's.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.701
Oh, right, I forgot.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.705
If you say so, Fonz.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.606
I say so. Put him down, Reb.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.610
And I want to tell you
something else,

07:59.746 --> 08:02.272
fighting is very low
on my list of priorities.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.146
Mine, too. Isn't it low on your
list of priorities, Rebel?

08:05.285 --> 08:06.718
I ain't got no priorities.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.253
I got a Chevy.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.390
RALPH:
He's got a Chevy.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.254
Well, no fighting in Arnold's.
Too bad.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.588
No hard feelings, huh, Rebel?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.195
All right, look,
I'm behind my schedule here.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.319
All right.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.728
Girls? (snaps fingers)
Inspiration Point.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.500
Well, I'm behind schedule, too.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.628
Have a good game, Rebel.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.535
You're off the hook for now.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.199
I am?

08:31.678 --> 08:32.975
But tomorrow night,
after the game,

08:33.113 --> 08:35.638
I'm gonna take your nose
and turn it upside down.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.448
Bye. y'all.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.712
RALPH:
My nose?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.880
Upside down?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.015
If it rains, I'll drown.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.496
Fonzie, wait a minute.

08:52.632 --> 08:56.262
Are you trying to tell me that
you formed your own fraternity?

08:56.403 --> 08:57.392
That's right.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.266
I call it
the Fonza Fonza Rellis.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.101
I think that's
a very catchy name.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.210
"Fonza Fonza Rellis?"
That's cute.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.675
-(Joanie laughs)
- FONZIE: Hey, thanks a lot.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.907
As a matter of fact,
I even made up our own pin.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.244
See that?
It is a little motorcycle here

09:11.384 --> 09:13.648
on a broken heart.
The Fonza Fonza Rellis.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.415
Oh, Fonz, that's really neat.
Could I join?

09:16.556 --> 09:17.887
- No.
- Oh.

09:18.024 --> 09:21.290
Uh, Fonzie told me
the entrance requirements.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.588
Oh.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.323
All right,
come on over, everybody.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.530
I have found the perfect song

09:28.668 --> 09:30.796
for the Leopard Lodge
sing-along contest.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.302
And this year, we're gonna win.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.872
Uh, that's what you said
last year,

09:34.007 --> 09:35.406
and they closed
the curtain on us.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.941
Hey, let's get
this thing going here.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.171
I got a panting angora sweater
dying to be pinned.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.646
Dad has picked
"Down by the Old Mill Stream."

09:42.782 --> 09:44.079
Howard, that's good.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.946
- It's a real toe-tapper.
- HOWARD: Yeah.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.178

that was pretty good.

Oh, Ralph,

11:24.984 --> 11:26.042
why don't you sing "Mammy?"

11:26.185 --> 11:28.347
Oh, that would be nice.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.887
Come on, now, Ralph,
what is this all about?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.426
He and our fullback are fighting
over the honor of a woman.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.224
Yeah, his name's Rebel.
He wrestles alligators.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.702
Come on, folks, please.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.173
I can't fight Rebel.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.073
Think of Mickey

11:52.211 --> 11:54.112
their only son, squashed.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.715
Squashed?

11:55.848 --> 11:58.010
Well, Rebel's
pretty strong, Dad.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.382
He works part-time
as a forklift.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.455
Malph, look, you can't
spend the rest of your life

12:03.590 --> 12:05.455
running away from Rebel, because
you're gonna have to spend

12:05.592 --> 12:07.287
the rest of your life looking
over your shoulder.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.191
Besides, how do you think
Kitty's going to feel?

12:10.330 --> 12:13.595
Now, I ask you,
are you a man or a mouse?

12:13.733 --> 12:14.996
I'm waiting.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.228
- I'm thinking.
- HOWARD: Aah.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.465
I tell you something,
I love middle-class songfests,

12:20.607 --> 12:22.837
but I'm late for a ceremony.
I'm the ceremony.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.739
Hey, Mr. C, don't worry
about that singing.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.928
No, I didn't want
to upset 'em, Mrs. C.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.257
I'm gonna tell 'em
I was in a car accident.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.264
Oh. Now I want nothing
to do with this.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.266
All this violence.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.530
I blame it on TV Westerns.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.831
Well, speaking of violence,

12:52.972 --> 12:54.497
can you drive me over
to Jenny Piccalo's?

12:54.641 --> 12:57.633
(sighs) Just as long
as you don't watch any Westerns.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.178
Oh, Ralph,
if you get into any trouble,

13:00.313 --> 13:03.681
- Jenny Piccalo says give him
a knee right in... -Joanie!

13:03.816 --> 13:05.807
I'll tell you what, Ralph.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.012
I'm gonna show you a few boxing
tricks I learned in the Army.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.021
Uh, yeah, that's-that's good,
Dad, but...

13:11.157 --> 13:12.625
Ralph needs to train, you know?

13:12.759 --> 13:15.785
He needs to work on his jabs,
he needs to punch the heavy bag.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.123
What's this Rebel like?

13:17.263 --> 13:19.596
Mount Rushmore with fists.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.132
Well, then he's a slugger!

13:21.267 --> 13:22.462
Oh...

13:22.602 --> 13:24.126
Well, we now know what Rebel is.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.635
But what's a Malph?

13:25.772 --> 13:27.535
Yeah, what's a Malph?

13:27.674 --> 13:30.541
I got it, a boxer.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.077
- Yeah. -Yeah, that's right.
See, you're-you're small,

13:33.212 --> 13:34.202
but you're fast.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.611
You know, you can dance,
bob, weave.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.740
- Yeah. -The guy will never
lay a glove on you.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.751
- Dance, bob...
- That's it.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.616
- Weave. -Right! That's it.
- Yeah! Right!

13:42.755 --> 13:45.122
Richie, Potsie, get him over
to the gym, get him in shape.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.852
- Okay, come on, Ralph. Oh, yeah,
that's good. -Dance, bob, weave!

13:47.994 --> 13:49.860
- You think I can? -You bet you
can! -Of course you can, Malph!

13:49.996 --> 13:52.522
- Yeah, I can.
I'm not afraid of Rebel. -Yeah.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.032
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Who needs training?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.830

Hey.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.720
Yeah.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.722
Ralph, how do the gloves feel?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.259
Gloves? I thought
they were mittens. (laughs)

14:21.394 --> 14:24.261
Oh, yeah. Well,
y-you seem pretty happy.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.990
Aren't you a little bit nervous?

14:26.132 --> 14:29.329
Why should I be?
I'm gonna take a dive.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.266
You're gonna take a dive?

14:31.404 --> 14:33.770
- He's gonna take a dive.
- That's right.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.432
I might even make it
a swan dive.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.772
"He's still got it."
Yeah, right.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.244
G-Get over in the corner,
Ralph, please.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.905
Ralph, will you get
in the corner?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.847
Gee whiz.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.123
Hey, Rich,

14:52.258 --> 14:53.521
there's Rebel.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.855
I'm gonna have some fun
with him. Watch this.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.862
Hey, Rebel,
I saw your parents yesterday.

14:58.998 --> 15:01.296
I was at the zoo.
(laughs)

15:04.504 --> 15:05.767
Hey, Rich,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.896

15:24.657 --> 15:26.022
Hey, Fonz.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.218
I'm very proud of you, Ralph.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.794
- You showed up.
- Yeah.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.727
He's gonna take a dive.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.991
Are you running again?

15:33.132 --> 15:34.896
Not running; falling, Fonz.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.696
Get over here.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.703
You're gonna put
all pride aside,

15:39.839 --> 15:42.001
you're gonna fall in front
of your girlfriend?

15:42.141 --> 15:43.666
No sweat. Kitty's not here.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.607
I sent her to the movies
with Potsie.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.611
Believe me, Fonz,
I know what I'm doing.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.613
Let me tell you something.
I'm gonna be here,

15:49.749 --> 15:51.080
right there,
and I'm gonna watch you

15:51.217 --> 15:53.049
and you're gonna stay here

15:53.186 --> 15:54.551
-you understand?
- Right, Fonz.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.885
All right. Now,
I wish you the best of luck.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.221

that I am,

16:01.360 --> 16:03.226

some luck

16:13.472 --> 16:15.600
Ralph,
are-are you gonna fight him?

16:15.741 --> 16:16.936
Nah, nah, I lied.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.601
I'll worry about Fonzie later.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.304
I can only throw one fight
at a time.

16:21.447 --> 16:22.642

16:22.782 --> 16:25.308
Potsie! He brought Kitty!

Hey, everybody. (chuckles)
How's it going, Malph?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.845
You're supposed to be
at the movies.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.356
Why would we be at the movies?
We'd miss the fight.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.359
- Let me at him! Let me...
- Hey, look at that.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.554
He's raring to go.
That's my roommate.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.563
Potsie, will you sit down?

16:39.699 --> 16:42.065
Ralph.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.534
You got to pull yourself
together.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.297
How about me singing
the national anthem?

16:46.439 --> 16:47.497
Please sit down.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.835
How about "Teen Angel"?

16:48.975 --> 16:50.169
Get out of the ring!

16:50.309 --> 16:52.300
Should've stayed at the movies.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.213
Guys, I can't throw the fight
in front of Kitty.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.819
Well, what are you
gonna do, Ralph?

16:59.952 --> 17:01.886

20:19.718 --> 20:21.186
Down? I thought I was up.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.583
ALFRED:
...five, six...

20:22.721 --> 20:24.087
I got to do it for Kitty.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.682
...seven, eight, nine...
Ralph...

20:27.827 --> 20:31.024
Please, Ralph, stop!

20:33.499 --> 20:35.331
.L-ley, Ralph!
-(cheering)

20:37.002 --> 20:38.800
(cheering)

20:38.938 --> 20:40.303
Wait, wait, wait!

20:40.439 --> 20:41.805
Look! Look!

20:41.941 --> 20:44.467
(cheering)

20:44.610 --> 20:45.873
Wait, wait!

20:46.011 --> 20:47.536
Look!

20:47.680 --> 20:49.648
(cheering)

20:49.782 --> 20:52.308
Ralph! Go, Ralph! Yes!

20:52.451 --> 20:54.249
Wait, wait.

20:54.386 --> 20:57.379
Look. Look. See?

21:01.193 --> 21:02.490
Neutral corner.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.619
Two, five, ten.

21:06.232 --> 21:09.326
- The winner, Rebel!
-(bell clangs)

21:10.669 --> 21:12.535
Ralph, Ralph, are you all right?

21:12.671 --> 21:14.003
C-Can you hear me? Huh?

21:14.140 --> 21:15.664
Did I... did I Win?

21:15.808 --> 21:18.004
Winners don't sit on floors.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.338
I didn't win.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.173
Hey, but look
at the bright side, Malph.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.374
You lasted 40 seconds longer
than the champion alligator.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.508
- Let's get him. Let's get...
- Yeah, come on, Malph.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.711
- That was great.
- It was a great punch, Ralph.

21:28.854 --> 21:30.254
You ain't kidding.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.585
I felt like a railroad spike.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.125
- Am I still pretty?
- Yeah, you're gorgeous.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.593
Let me tell you something,
I'm very proud of you, Malph.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.254
But I lost, Fonz.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.593
Hey, wait a minute.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.326
Now, listen, I'm not all
for fighting, you know.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.662
Sometimes you get your back
against the wall,

21:43.802 --> 21:45.065
you got to do it.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.400
You didn't lose
'cause you didn't run away.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.201
You did good.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.233
Thanks, Fonz.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.382
RALPH:
See you at the party!

21:58.517 --> 22:00.076
I don't have to bring
my rubber nose!

22:00.219 --> 22:01.550
Mine's still swollen!

22:03.522 --> 22:05.513
I Still got it!

22:11.263 --> 22:13.254
(speaking indistinctly)

22:31.016 --> 22:32.882
I haven't got it.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.214
I lost the fight.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.345
<i>L</i> lost Kitty.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.559
Ralph?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.856
I was talking to Rebel.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.863
Yeah. I saw.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.831
Congratulating him.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.560
No.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.103
I was saying good-bye to him.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.263
Forever.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.574
Good-bye?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.701
Forever.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.572
Kitty.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.274
My Kitty.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.044
My Ralph.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.177
I got it back.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.441
Oh, thank you for calling,
Minnie.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.572
Give my love to Mickey.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.778
Well, I am so glad
this fighting business is over.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.550
- I think fighting
is just so silly. -Mmm.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.625
You know, now, in my family,
we used to settle

23:47.760 --> 23:49.284
our differences another way.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.590
Yes, by yelling.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.598
That was just with you, Howard.

23:54.733 --> 23:57.066
We would arm-wrestle.

23:57.202 --> 23:58.636
(laughing)

23:58.771 --> 24:01.240
Arm-wrestle?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.399
Your mother, maybe, but not you.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.942
Yes, me.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.943
You want to give it a try,
big fella?

24:07.079 --> 24:09.275
Come on.

24:09.415 --> 24:12.111
Okay. Let's go.

24:12.251 --> 24:15.778
Listen,
promise you won't hurt me, huh?

24:15.921 --> 24:17.912
All right.

24:18.924 --> 24:21.120
Get your elbow on.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.786
That's it. All right,
whenever you're ready.

24:28.901 --> 24:29.891
(chuckles)

24:34.173 --> 24:35.970
Pretty good. Pretty good.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.099
You want to go upstairs?

24:38.243 --> 24:39.768
No.

24:39.912 --> 24:42.779
Best two out of three, Marion.
Come on.
