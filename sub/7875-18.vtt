You're aware of
the serious nature of the
charges brought against you?

00:36.125 --> 00:37.542
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.709
Begin and speak loudly, please.
This is for the record.

00:40.709 --> 00:43.375
Well, the whole thing started
on Friday the 10th.

00:43.375 --> 00:44.834
I got off work early

00:44.834 --> 00:46.792
so I could pick up my son
and his friends from school.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.709
Ah, a gym.

00:50.709 --> 00:53.667
Where huge kids
with pituitary problems
are pitted against the weak.

00:55.667 --> 00:56.500
What the--

00:59.291 --> 01:01.875
I got you. You have
to go to tickle jail!

01:03.458 --> 01:06.208
Your bail is set at
one gumdrop.

01:07.250 --> 01:09.083
What the hell is going on?

01:09.083 --> 01:11.583
What happened to the Langley
Falls Fighting Buffaloes?

01:11.583 --> 01:14.250
We're now the Langley Falls
Prancing Buffaloes.

01:16.542 --> 01:19.375
Honey, could you fetch me
the gym teacher
and two cups of coffee?

01:19.375 --> 01:20.583
He'll want bourbon in his.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.291
I am the gym teacher.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.500
No, no, no, you're confused.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.250
You're a
home economics teacher.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.875
Now scoot back
in the fake kitchen

01:26.875 --> 01:28.125
and sew
something tasty.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.375
Silly boots.

01:29.375 --> 01:31.875
We're just finishing up
a game of tickle play.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.750
Hi, Dad!

01:34.750 --> 01:36.542
Well, did my boy's team
win at least?

01:36.542 --> 01:37.959
Oh, there's no winning.

01:37.959 --> 01:40.625
We don't like to foster
a competitive atmosphere,

01:40.625 --> 01:42.083
but we laugh a lot.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.083
Now everyone hug
and share a secret.

01:45.542 --> 01:47.709
I'm afraid
of moths.

01:47.709 --> 01:49.959
My therapist says
I'm a bad kisser.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.792
What's happened to America?

01:54.792 --> 01:56.959
Your whole generation
has gone soft.

01:56.959 --> 01:59.375
How are you gonna become men if
you're not tackling each other

01:59.375 --> 02:00.959
and ruining your knees
for life?

02:00.959 --> 02:03.625
-But tickle play is fun.
-And easy.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.291
Plus we get trophies
just for playing.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.542
Life isn't fun or easy
or what the Asian kid said.

02:11.542 --> 02:12.709
It's tough and brutal.

02:12.709 --> 02:14.834
Life sounds mean.

02:14.834 --> 02:17.959
Damn right. You don't
get a trophy in life
just for showing up.

02:18.834 --> 02:19.875
Glitter!

02:19.875 --> 02:21.417
No! No glitter!

02:21.417 --> 02:24.417
How do you expect
to become men if you
never do anything hard?

02:24.417 --> 02:26.542
Simple. We'll get safe,
easy jobs.

02:26.542 --> 02:29.083
And we'll keep quiet
so we don't ruffle
any feathers.

02:29.083 --> 02:32.667
Eventually our female friends
will realize we're the best
they're gonna do,

02:32.667 --> 02:34.458
and they'll browbeat us
into marrying them.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.083
And then we'll get cake!

02:38.709 --> 02:41.375
I see one tear, fatty,
and I'm doing it again.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.208
Good. You're not busy.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.208
I need somebody to talk to.
I just--

02:49.917 --> 02:52.208
I just love her so much.

02:54.959 --> 02:57.375
-Who?
-The cashier at Booze Town.

02:57.375 --> 02:59.375
You have a crush on
the liquor store girl?

02:59.375 --> 03:01.000
Oh, heavens, yes.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.166
That's why I need you
to pretend to be my girlfriend

03:03.166 --> 03:05.917
so she'll get jealous
and want me for herself.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.500
Roger, I, I'm not sure
that'll--

03:07.500 --> 03:09.542
Hayley, you gotta help.
You just gotta!

03:09.542 --> 03:11.250
Okay, I'll go down there
with you.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.083
God bless you.
You're an angel.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.166
Now go dress like a woman.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.792
I have heels
if you need to borrow.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.083
How's it coming, boys?

03:19.083 --> 03:21.500
Have you pummeled each other
into manhood yet?

03:21.500 --> 03:23.000
I can't reach it.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.458
Don't get sun on me!

03:24.458 --> 03:27.125
What in the name
of Red Grange is
going on out here?

03:27.125 --> 03:30.917
We were pretending
the football was a panda egg.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.625
But then it rolled into
the sun.

03:32.625 --> 03:34.834
There's melanoma out there,
Mr. Smith.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.458
Moth! Moth! It's gonna
leave dust on me!

03:39.291 --> 03:42.375
Leave him!
He's as good as dead!

03:42.375 --> 03:44.583
Boys, get out here, now.

03:44.583 --> 03:47.959
The sun's rays will
bake you to a leathering
Willie Nelson crust.

03:47.959 --> 03:49.959
But being outside is hard.

03:49.959 --> 03:51.125
That's the point.

03:51.125 --> 03:53.250
There are three simple
rules of manhood.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.542
A man is tough,

03:54.542 --> 03:55.959
a man takes charge,

03:55.959 --> 03:57.583
and a man never quits.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.458
Let's set the rules to
a soulful acapella melody.

04:00.458 --> 04:04.041
♪ A man takes charge
A man is tough ♪

04:04.041 --> 04:05.834
♪ A man is tough ♪

04:10.542 --> 04:12.709
There she is, Hayley.
Let's do a walk-by.

04:12.709 --> 04:14.417
You got it, lover.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.333
God, baby, your back
is so toned.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.417
Oh, my lats.

04:19.417 --> 04:21.417
Yeah, the electric
can opener broke.

04:21.417 --> 04:23.583
I've been opening 'em manually.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.000
With these
big, strong hands?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.417
Ah. They make me feel
so safe.

04:28.417 --> 04:29.917
Thanks. Cans again.

04:29.917 --> 04:31.375
I'll tell you the cans I like.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.250
Oh, sassy-hands!

04:34.250 --> 04:36.041
Don't just get
one cheek, girl.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.417
Other side.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.375
So do you think it worked?

04:42.667 --> 04:44.250
Something worked.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.166
Hayley, I'm no longer in love
with the booze girl.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.500
I'm in love with you.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.667
-Uh--
-Shh.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.542
I stole your Dentyne
with my big, strong hands.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.125
Good. You're not busy.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.417
Steve doesn't know
how to be a man.

05:04.417 --> 05:06.834
Who's gonna take over
when I'm enjoying a glorious

05:06.834 --> 05:09.250
Reagan-style slide
into dementia?

05:09.250 --> 05:11.041
What do you think? You're
the smartest person I know.

05:11.041 --> 05:13.166
I mean I've always
respected you,

05:13.166 --> 05:15.208
even when you were drinking
and doing all that coke.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.417
Oh, Stan, thank you.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.375
Hmm? Oh! Oh, God.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.792
Oh, oh, not you, Francine.
God, no!

05:21.792 --> 05:24.166
No, I was talking to the photo
of George W. Bush.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.709
Look at you.

05:25.709 --> 05:29.083
A perfect specimen of a man,
swaggering across your ranch.

05:29.083 --> 05:32.375
God. Tim Purcell always
got the best coke.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.291
That's it. That's how
I'll make them into men.

05:35.291 --> 05:38.250
Francine, bring those
beautiful lips over here
so I can kiss them.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.834
Oh, Stan.

05:39.834 --> 05:42.000
Never mind, I can reach it. Mm.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.291
Rise and shine, boys.

05:50.291 --> 05:53.583
Tell Sally Swimsuit Dream
you'll take a rain check
on those kisses.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.875
Dad, it's 5:00
in the morning!

05:55.875 --> 05:59.417
Let's move! The dawn
of manhood has arrived.

05:59.417 --> 06:02.834
George Bush, Ronald Reagan,
Mr. Jolly...

06:02.834 --> 06:05.333
All ranchers,
all men.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.291
Welcome to the Smith man ranch.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.667
You're cowboys now,

06:14.667 --> 06:17.667
but when we're done,
you'll be cowmen.

06:17.667 --> 06:20.208
So if any of you boys
wanna cry or wet yourselves,

06:20.208 --> 06:21.375
this is your last chance.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.000
Good. Okay.
This guy gets it.

06:27.375 --> 06:29.959
You, you filled our yard
with cows?

06:29.959 --> 06:31.417
Good eye. Nice ranching.

06:31.417 --> 06:33.208
I got a great deal
on these things.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.917
They tenderize themselves.

06:37.917 --> 06:39.417
Well, good luck, Steve.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.375
We're going to Pancake Pete's.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.542
It's Strawberry Saturday.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.750
Nope, you're staying
right here.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.208
I cleared it
with your parents.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.834
Slim, that's your cowboy name,

06:49.834 --> 06:52.166
your mom said your therapist
thought it was a great idea.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.667
Banzai, your parents
I couldn't understand.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.083
I assume they're on board.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.166
Tubs, your folks seemed
not to care much either way.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.667
Almost surprised
they had a kid.

06:59.667 --> 07:03.208
-Now let's get to work.
-Not on Strawberry Saturday!

07:04.291 --> 07:06.250
Your parents said
I could hit you.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.792
Hey.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.000
Hey, you.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
-Oh, hi, Roger.
-Not you.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.709
Hey. Hey, you.

07:14.709 --> 07:16.208
Oh. Hey, Roger.

07:16.208 --> 07:19.250
Made you this.
It's a diorama of us,

07:19.250 --> 07:21.709
riding the gondola at
the Venetian in Vegas.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.333
Uh, wow.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.083
I made you out of Twizzlers
'cause you're thin and sweet.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.083
That's very nice.
Thanks, Roger.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.583
She likes it.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.083
What was that all about?

07:32.083 --> 07:34.875
Oh, it's silly. Roger's got
a little crush on me.

07:34.875 --> 07:38.291
Look. He says I'm the prettiest
girl in the house.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.208
Roger.

07:43.875 --> 07:46.709
Last time I checked
I lived in this house too.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.625
Stop! Stop!

07:50.625 --> 07:53.625
This is not what I pictured
when I was at the rope store.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.667
-It's hard.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.208
Maybe you'd rather go inside
and bake a souffle.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.083
Oh, God, yes.
Thank you.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.625
Dad, are we done?

08:28.625 --> 08:30.834
Yeah, Mr. Smith.
Can we have some food?

08:30.834 --> 08:32.291
Oh, absolutely.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.375
Can't expect a rancher
to ranch on an empty stomach.

08:34.375 --> 08:37.250
Boys, who would you say
loves the calf the most?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.583
Oh, I do!

08:38.583 --> 08:41.166
Rosie calms my dark places.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.375
Terrific. Then it'll
be you who kills her.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.333
-What?
-A man kills what a man loves

08:46.333 --> 08:47.417
before it weakens him.

08:47.417 --> 08:50.291
You can't make me
kill Rosie.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.041
You boys sure you don't
want some Rosie?

08:55.041 --> 08:56.792
No. No, thanks.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.000
Mm. I'm eating
the face right now.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.417
Mm. Good cut
of face meat.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.291
Her eyes said, "Why?"

09:04.291 --> 09:06.875
Yeah, you can still see
the look of betrayal.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.083
Can't grill that off.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.417
Uh, what are you doing?

09:14.417 --> 09:15.875
Just sketching you nude

09:15.875 --> 09:17.250
wearing the Heart of the Ocean.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.417
I'm flattered,

09:18.417 --> 09:21.583
but this infatuation,
it's getting a--

09:21.583 --> 09:24.000
Wow! Frannie,
look at you!

09:24.000 --> 09:26.333
Thanks.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.625
Just trying to look pretty,
'cause, you know,

09:29.625 --> 09:30.917
I live in the house.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.542
Check you out!

09:32.542 --> 09:35.458
Bam in the bam!
The bop in the woo!

09:36.583 --> 09:38.125
I thought you
were drawing me.

09:38.125 --> 09:41.750
I was, but I never realized
your mother had the wa-bam!

09:42.542 --> 09:43.792
Uh, excuse me, Mom.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.333
I was just about to take
Roger to Red Lobster.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.709
You were?

09:47.709 --> 09:49.500
Uh-huh. Did you know
they have a new dipping sauce?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.000
They do?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.250
There wasn't anything
about it in the Fresh Catch.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.625
That's their e-bulletin.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.208
I know that! I was the one
that told you about it.

09:57.208 --> 10:00.250
Fronting like you're on
the cutting edge of
Red Lobster news.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.208
Anyway, I thought
you and I could go.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.542
Sure, Roger.

10:03.542 --> 10:06.000
Or you and I
could go to a bar,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.500
get rocked on Goldschlager
like grown-ups.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.041
Oh, but Hayley's
not old enough.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.083
You know, I once made
my own Goldschlager

10:14.083 --> 10:16.667
by mixing red-hots,
mouthwash and some tinfoil

10:16.667 --> 10:17.917
from a chocolate Easter egg.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.208
Surprisingly, not good.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.000
Oh.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.333
Mm. Mm.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.875
Boys?

10:29.375 --> 10:31.250
What's going on?
Why aren't you working?

10:31.250 --> 10:32.709
We don't like working.

10:32.709 --> 10:34.208
We like watching cartoons.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.834
Men don't do what they like.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.834
Men get wives and jobs to
keep them from what they like.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.000
Look, Dad,
we don't wanna be men.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
We're not tough,
we don't take charge,

10:43.000 --> 10:44.417
and we love quitting.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.542
And a yard full of cows
isn't gonna change that.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.375
Mm-hmm.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.333
We're going on a cattle drive?

10:51.333 --> 10:52.458
That's right, Son.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.375
Making you ranchers
in the backyard

10:54.375 --> 10:55.917
was never
gonna make you men.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.125
What you need
is a rite of passage.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.291
Mr. Smith,
my unicorn is broken.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.917
We'll just take these cows
across town

11:04.917 --> 11:06.875
and drop 'em off
at the slaughterhouse.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.834
Just imagine
how good it'll feel

11:08.834 --> 11:10.291
to finish the job like men.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.625
$500 a head?

11:18.625 --> 11:21.250
I don't know about that,
Banzai, but we'll do all right.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.583
We'll do all right.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.083
Tough ridin',

11:25.083 --> 11:27.458
but nothing like a little
Rosie jerky to keep me going.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.000
Boys?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.333
I can't believe
you killed her, Barry.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.208
You're a cold son of a bitch.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.500
Oop. Doorbell's ready.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.083
Hello, ma'am.
We're from the Department
of Agriculture.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.917
It seems you were sold
some cattle tainted
with mad cow disease.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.875
My husband's taking them
to the slaughterhouse
right now.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.625
Good Lord.
We have to stop him.

11:52.625 --> 11:55.333
Ma'am, if you have any of that
tainted beef, throw it out.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.250
It's crucial no one eats it.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.625
It drives them mad.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.834
You boys see these owls?
Get out of here, owls!

12:04.834 --> 12:06.166
Stop pecking at my face!

12:06.166 --> 12:08.208
I will not buy
your encyclopedias.

12:08.208 --> 12:10.417
I can't read your language.
I can only speak it.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.917
Okay, that's weird.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.417
You know, this would
never have happened

12:18.417 --> 12:21.291
if we went to my house
after school, but no.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.250
You guys are too creeped out
by my mom's wooden foot.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.166
You know, most people
throw away the hoof.

12:33.166 --> 12:34.250
Never understood it.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.542
None for you, owls!

12:35.542 --> 12:36.709
All right, boys.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.542
On to the slaughterhouse.

12:38.542 --> 12:39.959
I think it's possible

12:39.959 --> 12:42.125
there just might be
something wrong with your dad.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.291
Oh, yeah?

12:43.291 --> 12:44.458
There's something wrong
with your dad too.

12:44.458 --> 12:45.792
Your dad left you!

12:45.792 --> 12:48.458
Uh, I'm not comparing dads.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.875
I'm just saying yours
is in his underwear

12:50.875 --> 12:52.417
swatting at invisible owls.

12:53.959 --> 12:54.959
Oh, yeah.

12:54.959 --> 12:56.667
Let me look into that.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.917
Dad, is everything okay?

12:58.917 --> 13:01.291
Couldn't be better.
Nature...

13:01.291 --> 13:03.417

14:09.083 --> 14:10.959
Dad, why are you
dancing with a beer box

14:10.959 --> 14:12.208
and a Filet-O-Fish wrapper?

14:12.208 --> 14:13.709
Happy trails, friends.

14:13.709 --> 14:15.291
All right, boys.
All we gotta do

14:15.291 --> 14:17.291
is cross that river,
and we'll be home free.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.250
Dad, that's not a river.
That's a highway.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.041
Steve, take off
that lobster costume

14:24.041 --> 14:25.458
and start wrapping
our gear in plastic.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.333
We don't want it to get wet
when we cross.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.500
This is crazy, Steve.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.959
Your dad is gonna
kill us all.

14:29.959 --> 14:33.000
Your dad shot your mom
in the face with a flare gun.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.458
I'm, I'm sorry, Snot.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.583
I don't mean
to keep going there.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.125
We gotta stop him.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.792
All right, relax, relax.

14:38.792 --> 14:42.250
We'll, we'll just relieve him
of command. Huddle up!

14:42.250 --> 14:44.500
Okay. Barry, you're
gonna approach him

14:44.500 --> 14:46.333
from the front
complaining of a tummy ache.

14:46.333 --> 14:49.041
When he reaches out to hit you,
Toshi and Snot,

14:49.041 --> 14:51.917
you guys grab his arms
and pull them back
as hard as you can.

14:51.917 --> 14:53.417
I'll then take this rock

14:53.417 --> 14:55.500
and keep striking him
until he's quiet.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.291
- You guys ready?
- Ready!

15:01.792 --> 15:03.583
I am so frightened.

15:03.583 --> 15:07.083
He's much bigger
than you made him look
in the dirt.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.625
Damn it. Who are we kidding?
We're not men.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.208
We're puny little bunnies,
and that's all we'll ever be.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.625
All right, men,
saddle up.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.792
I'll blaze the trail,
you follow with the cattle.

15:19.792 --> 15:20.917
Meet you on the other side.

15:20.917 --> 15:21.917
Hyah!

15:22.375 --> 15:23.667
Dad, no!

15:35.333 --> 15:37.041
Those logs are gonna fall!

15:37.041 --> 15:38.667
Let's call a teacher!

15:38.667 --> 15:39.917
There's no time.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.792
He may be crazy,
but he's my dad.

15:41.792 --> 15:42.625
Hyah.

15:49.834 --> 15:52.625
Moths. Why did it
have to be moths?

15:53.375 --> 15:54.291
Hyah!

15:57.333 --> 15:58.625
I can't watch.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.834
Hang on, Steve!

16:22.583 --> 16:24.917
I can't... Hold it!

16:35.875 --> 16:39.166
Now we can forget about
this stupid cattle drive
and go home.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.625
No. Rule number three,

16:46.625 --> 16:48.625
a man never quits.

16:48.625 --> 16:51.125
We're gonna bring
these cattle to slaughter!

16:53.542 --> 16:55.000
Toshi, I think this is yours.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.458
-Uh, mine had the white band.
-Mine is a hat.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.458
Wow, Hayley. Look at you.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.709
Ding, ding!
Technical knockout.

17:09.709 --> 17:11.250
Francine, doesn't she
look terrific?

17:11.250 --> 17:12.166
Nah.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.208
Come on. Look at that body.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.583
Young, firm, everything's
where it should be.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.959
I guess she is
the prettiest one
in the house.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.333
Oh, really?

17:21.333 --> 17:24.166
'Cause all I see
are tissue boobs!

17:24.166 --> 17:26.125
Fakies!

17:26.125 --> 17:28.375
Well, you know what I see?

17:28.375 --> 17:30.000
Crow's-feet!

17:30.000 --> 17:32.500
Age-defying makeup!

17:32.500 --> 17:33.875
-Hag!
-Tramp!

17:33.875 --> 17:36.000
Ladies, please, no violence.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.583
Get off of me, you cow!

17:41.583 --> 17:43.375
I'll spit in your lazy eye!

17:43.375 --> 17:45.083
I had that corrected.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.500
I can still tell!

17:46.500 --> 17:48.417
I can't condone this.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.959
You love each other,
remember?

17:56.959 --> 17:58.166
These are here
if you want 'em.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.792
Bite her, Hayley!

18:01.792 --> 18:03.875
Scratch her eyes out, Francine!

18:03.875 --> 18:05.583
-What are you doing?
-Perfect.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.291
I think I got enough.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.875
Enough? Enough for what?

18:09.875 --> 18:12.792
Why, for
MotherDaughterCatFight.com.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.417
You submit footage of
your best mother-daughter
scratch fest,

18:15.417 --> 18:17.125
and they send you
a free T-shirt.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.333
You...

18:18.333 --> 18:19.959
You set all this up?

18:19.959 --> 18:21.500
The liquor store girl,

18:21.500 --> 18:24.083
the diorama,
just for a T-shirt?

18:24.083 --> 18:26.417
Mm-hmm. I think
I'm gonna get a medium.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.458
I know I'm a large,
but I'm gonna get a medium.

18:28.458 --> 18:29.875
We...

18:29.875 --> 18:31.875
We became animals.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.208
Oh, and for the record,

18:33.208 --> 18:35.834
I'm the prettiest one
in the house.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.291
There it is!

18:45.250 --> 18:47.583
-Stop!
-See, I told you we had
time for ice cream.

18:47.583 --> 18:48.959
We just couldn't eat it there.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.417
You boys can't do this.

18:50.417 --> 18:53.583
No boys here, only men.

18:53.583 --> 18:55.667
Let's get these dogies home!

18:55.667 --> 18:56.500
Hyah!

18:59.208 --> 19:00.083
No, stop!

19:04.792 --> 19:08.166
We did it!

19:09.542 --> 19:11.375
Those cows will infect
the entire herd.

19:11.375 --> 19:12.959
You've tainted
the whole beef supply.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.125
Maybe it won't spread.

19:22.417 --> 19:26.166
I, sir, will not stay
at a Red Roof Inn!

19:26.166 --> 19:27.917
So that's how it happened.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.166
My fever went down
about a week later.

19:30.166 --> 19:33.250
Sir, in all my years of
attending beef safety hearings,

19:33.250 --> 19:35.917
that is the wildest story
I've ever heard.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.625
Your irresponsible actions

19:37.625 --> 19:41.417
resulted in 100,000 head
of cattle being put down.

19:41.417 --> 19:43.250
It's clear to me that
you deserve punishment

19:43.250 --> 19:44.792
to the fullest extent
of the law.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.250
- Wait!
- Huh?

19:46.250 --> 19:48.333
Frank, that fat child
has an opinion.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.875
Maybe Mr. Smith is crazy,

19:50.875 --> 19:53.875
but Mr. Smith also
taught me to be tough.

19:53.875 --> 19:55.083
That's right.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.041
Mr. Smith taught us
about never giving up

19:57.041 --> 19:58.667
and acting like men.

19:58.667 --> 20:01.458
Maybe a cattle drive
through a city
wasn't the best idea,

20:01.458 --> 20:04.583
but my dad showed us
what it means to take charge,

20:04.583 --> 20:05.917
and when we needed to,

20:05.917 --> 20:08.000
we were ready,
thanks to him.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.333
-Still--
-Toshi, tell him!

20:35.875 --> 20:38.583
I didn't understand a word
of that funny talk,

20:38.583 --> 20:41.000
but it was clearly
a touching tribute

20:41.000 --> 20:42.959
to you as a mentor,
Mr. Smith.

20:42.959 --> 20:45.166
You taught these boys manhood,

20:45.166 --> 20:48.583
and that's worth
all the cows in the world.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.709
All charges dropped.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.875
-Thanks, Dad.
-You made me proud, Son.
