00:07.944 --> 00:10.893
We said, "is there a friendly spirit here?"

00:10.894 --> 00:13.414
It said "no".

00:13.515 --> 00:14.416
Hey!

00:14.417 --> 00:16.514
Something odd was happening in the house.

00:16.515 --> 00:19.142
What have we done? What have we done?

00:19.143 --> 00:22.031
It's like a long streak and it
had fire coming out of its back.

00:22.032 --> 00:24.400
This woman thinks she is seeing a UFO.

00:24.401 --> 00:26.919
- I could hear her nervousness.
- But it's not moving.

00:26.920 --> 00:30.116
All of a sudden everything
electronic in my vehicle dies.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.502
998, do you read me?

00:31.503 --> 00:33.550
Any unit who doesn't
answer, that's a crisis.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.666
Do you read me?

00:35.667 --> 00:40.158
I really knew that I was not
alone in that house anymore.

00:40.159 --> 00:43.318
I was scared it was going
to hurt one of us.

00:43.319 --> 00:45.963
My hand was right on my pistol.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.979
It was weird, wait a minute oh
my God, I ain't ready for this.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.920
It was unbelievable.

01:07.159 --> 01:10.294
Do you want to head over to that area?

01:10.295 --> 01:13.955
I remember that night vividly.

01:13.959 --> 01:15.249
It was a December night.

01:15.250 --> 01:19.886
And it was unusually warm because
I remember not wearing a jacket.

01:19.887 --> 01:24.249
My first call was a domestic,
between a male and a female.

01:24.250 --> 01:29.170
Usually when it's warmer,
we seem to be busy.

01:29.185 --> 01:31.225
I had to fill out a report.

01:31.226 --> 01:37.095
And so I had made plans with the other
officers to meet up and have a coffee.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.356
I loved being a cop. I believed
this was a calling for me.

01:40.357 --> 01:42.504
This is what I was meant to do.

01:45.869 --> 01:49.432
I have been a police
officer for fifteen years.

01:49.433 --> 01:54.024
When I worked at 911, we dispatched for
the greater portion of Trumbull County.

01:54.025 --> 01:57.385
It's a pretty vast area.

01:57.547 --> 02:00.315
We would receive calls
for emergency service,

02:00.316 --> 02:03.815
and we would also dispatch police units.

02:03.816 --> 02:07.044
I was expecting what we
have every other night.

02:07.045 --> 02:11.389
A little bit of traffic related calls,
we were going to have a few bar fights.

02:11.390 --> 02:16.082
The calls that began that night,
initially, caught me off guard.

02:16.083 --> 02:19.443
Dispatch, can I help you?

02:26.148 --> 02:28.906
He was calm, but at the same time
you could hear the nervousness.

02:28.907 --> 02:33.587
He wasn't familiar with what he was seeing.

02:56.043 --> 02:59.587
Knowing that our jurisdiction is
quite in line with an Air Base,

02:59.588 --> 03:01.370
my first reaction was...

03:01.371 --> 03:04.126
Oh my gosh what if there's something
wrong with one of the aircraft's,

03:04.127 --> 03:05.663
or something in the area.

03:05.664 --> 03:08.962
But the tone in his voice doesn't
reflect he's watching a plane crash.

03:08.963 --> 03:12.023
It's quite different.

03:20.347 --> 03:23.194
And I tell the other people... okay guy's

03:23.195 --> 03:26.540
everyone grab your pens, you know we're
gonna have to get to work here now.

03:26.541 --> 03:28.458
Something odd's going on,

03:28.459 --> 03:31.666
because this guy's seen fire coming
out from the back of a plane.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.221
Are we going to prepare
for an airplane crash?

03:34.222 --> 03:37.669
There's a buzz now. This isn't
something you normally hear.

03:37.670 --> 03:43.136
So while I am taking the first call,
I'm alerted that there's another call.

03:43.137 --> 03:45.444
Liberty dispatch, can I help you?

03:45.445 --> 03:51.345
It was a mother and daughter, very excited
about these lights they were seeing.

03:51.828 --> 03:55.288
She, more or less, just tells me
the same thing the first guy says.

03:55.289 --> 03:56.578
I'm seeing lights in the sky.

03:56.579 --> 03:58.411
Right behind our backyard.

03:58.412 --> 04:01.017
They're not hearing any
noise, and it just hovers.

04:01.018 --> 04:04.089
That seems to be what really troubled her.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.043
It's just hovering there.

04:06.044 --> 04:08.938
They were very certain they
were not looking at a plane.

04:08.939 --> 04:10.990
Thank you so much, bye-bye.

04:10.991 --> 04:15.431
Now you think okay, this is kinda crazy.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.757
But it's caught the attention
of all the other dispatchers,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.430
and we're all kind of
listening to everything.

04:19.432 --> 04:23.357
- Roy Anne, I have a reporter from 33.
- Oh God!

04:23.358 --> 04:25.621
The next call we received
was from the media.

04:25.622 --> 04:27.947
Liberty dispatch, can I help you?

04:27.948 --> 04:31.728
They were scanning all the police traffic.
What the heck am I going to tell the media?

04:46.405 --> 04:49.780
It was clear to me. This woman
thinks she's seeing a UFO.

04:49.781 --> 04:51.889
I don't want to acknowledge this.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.569
So I kinda gaff it off, and make a joke.

05:12.044 --> 05:14.699
I'm confirming, ya we've
heard about the lights too.

05:14.700 --> 05:18.394
But there's no need make this a panic,
we're not having war of the worlds here.

05:24.544 --> 05:27.912
Right after that somebody says...
"Liberty you have another UFO call".

05:27.913 --> 05:29.478
Oh gosh here we go again.

05:29.479 --> 05:32.934
Liberty dispatch. This is getting kooky.

05:32.935 --> 05:35.071
Okay, so lights in the sky.

05:49.493 --> 05:51.673
We're checking on it, thank you.

05:51.674 --> 05:57.574
The thing that's remarkable is all
going on in a small, quiet street.

05:57.959 --> 06:02.784
Sampson Drive's a nice residential area.
It's not a ton of crackpots.

06:02.785 --> 06:05.133
At this point, there's too many calls

06:05.134 --> 06:09.243
just to sit on this and, and make it my
problem because I don't pass it along.

06:09.244 --> 06:14.704
That night, officer Meloro
was working with me... Toby.

06:15.428 --> 06:18.271
What's that, two or three times?
In the last year...

06:18.272 --> 06:24.172
Toby and the other officers had kinda
assembled for an informal shift briefing.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.761
What are those two doing this? Every
three months just like clock work.

06:28.762 --> 06:32.839
They normally stop for coffee.
Doughnut shop, very cliche.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.986
I know it's a cliche, however it was one
of the only place's that's open at night.

06:36.987 --> 06:38.365
Thanks.

06:38.366 --> 06:40.352
Toby and I had known each other for years.

06:40.353 --> 06:43.055
And I think he's going to be
one out of the group working.

06:43.056 --> 06:45.994
That will handle this the best.

06:45.995 --> 06:48.507
I chose to use the cell
phone and not the radio,

06:48.508 --> 06:51.084
because this is something not recorded.

06:51.085 --> 06:55.783
If it makes me sound nutty,
it's just between Toby and I.

06:55.784 --> 06:58.695
I remember I had just picked up my
coffee, was putting it to my lips,

06:58.696 --> 07:02.583
when I received the call
from the 911 center.

07:02.584 --> 07:04.303
- Hello?
- I've known Roy Anne a long time.

07:04.304 --> 07:05.772
Hi, Roy Anne, what's up?

07:05.773 --> 07:07.871
I can tell usually by the voice...

07:07.872 --> 07:10.647
Whether I need to jump up and run...

07:10.648 --> 07:13.481
This is going to sound really crazy.

07:13.482 --> 07:16.923
On this call I didn't jump
right away I took my time

07:16.924 --> 07:18.460
I tell Toby over the phone...

07:18.461 --> 07:21.998
Toby, these people are calling about a UFO.
He said, "are you kidding me?"

07:21.999 --> 07:24.532
And he just kind of chuckled about it.

07:24.533 --> 07:27.869
We get calls all the time from people
that are drunk and intoxicated.

07:27.870 --> 07:30.843
People that don't have
anything better to do.

07:30.844 --> 07:34.309
I said it's on Sampson Drive.
It's all 5th Avenue extension.

07:34.310 --> 07:36.126
It's just that little area.

07:36.127 --> 07:39.128
Tell me you went there, tell me
you saw nothing. We'll be great.

07:39.129 --> 07:40.800
I swear to you it's not a prank.

07:40.801 --> 07:42.750
I felt like I had to assure him.

07:42.751 --> 07:45.850
You know, this isn't a prank you
need to go and check this out.

07:45.851 --> 07:47.526
Okay.

07:47.527 --> 07:49.839
It wasn't anything that
I was in a rush to do.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.260
I'm going to go take care of this.
And I proceeded to tell the guys...

07:53.261 --> 07:55.296
I was saying look let me
go get this over with.

07:55.297 --> 08:01.177
Keep an eye on my coffee? And
I'll back in a few minutes.

08:02.584 --> 08:04.532
I took my time getting there.

08:04.533 --> 08:08.945
I obeyed all the traffic, no lights,
no sirens, nothing like that.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.588
I was thinking of two things, either...

08:10.589 --> 08:15.490
People had been drinking, or they were
actually seeing some type of aircraft.

08:15.491 --> 08:17.506
It was not a priority call.

08:17.507 --> 08:19.487
I contacted the Sergeant of the turn

08:19.488 --> 08:22.942
he's the one who's going to
answer for all this later.

08:22.943 --> 08:26.124
I said... "Bob, calls are coming
in you have to hear this".

08:35.823 --> 08:37.244
Bob even made a crack...

08:49.747 --> 08:54.032
It probably took me 3 or 4
minutes to get in the area.

08:54.033 --> 08:58.023
As I was approaching, I called in to
get a little bit more information.

08:58.024 --> 08:59.634
998 to dispatch.

09:21.759 --> 09:23.679
Okay.

09:24.259 --> 09:28.279
As I turned on to Sampson Drive...

09:28.888 --> 09:32.688
A gentleman ran over to my car,
saying please stop! Please stop!

09:32.689 --> 09:34.771
- He seemed frightened, he seemed upset.
- A big white light.

09:34.772 --> 09:40.052
I'm thinking that there's
something major going on.

09:54.212 --> 09:58.472
The gentleman came over and flagged
me down and he seemed frightened.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.155
I proceeded to roll down the
window and asked him...

10:01.156 --> 10:04.229
Sir, what's going on? What's wrong?

10:04.230 --> 10:07.964
He hesitated. He was like
catching his breath.

10:07.965 --> 10:10.762
He then proceeded to point
up in the sky and say...

10:10.763 --> 10:13.009
"This huge light was just over my house".

10:13.010 --> 10:16.577
This light... I don't know what it was.

10:16.578 --> 10:21.429
I looked at him kind of out the corner
of my eye and said, "uh, okay".

10:21.430 --> 10:27.301
And then I leaned over to smell his breath
to see if maybe he had been drinking.

10:27.302 --> 10:29.677
Because he wasn't making a lot of sense.

10:29.678 --> 10:32.042
Vroom! Down the street.

10:32.043 --> 10:34.426
He was very insistent on what he saw.

10:34.427 --> 10:37.331
And he wanted me to go
check it out right away.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.604
He believed it was something
that was serious.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.885
All right.

10:44.359 --> 10:48.913
I'm thinking if Toby just goes and sees
a helicopter this will be put to bed.

10:48.914 --> 10:52.038
That is not what happened.

10:52.039 --> 10:55.085
I couldn't have been more than a
couple hundred feet away from,

10:55.086 --> 10:58.095
where I had stopped the individual.

10:58.096 --> 11:01.384
I could see a light in the distance.

11:01.385 --> 11:04.172
It was a little bit away
from me and was large.

11:04.173 --> 11:06.581
So I proceeded to let Roy Anne know.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.682
You know, what there is some type of light.

11:08.683 --> 11:10.667
998 to dispatch.

11:20.738 --> 11:22.927
Oh no. You see a light now too.

11:22.928 --> 11:25.593
Oh you're kidding me. Great.

11:25.594 --> 11:28.577
Great, now you're in with the
whole hysteria of the thing.

11:38.055 --> 11:40.766
Okay. Now this is Toby.
This is somebody we know.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.725
And he's now seeing it.
And he's adding to it.

11:43.726 --> 11:46.286
So it kinda kicks it up a notch.

11:56.533 --> 11:59.109
At that point, it comes out
of his mouth "flying saucer".

11:59.110 --> 12:00.953
And this is over the radio. So I thought...

12:00.954 --> 12:04.692
Oh this is going to be
where everybody joins in.

12:04.693 --> 12:07.977
And he goes on to tell me... "Look,
I'm trying get closer to it".

12:07.978 --> 12:11.271
What do you mean you're trying to
get closer to it? What's going on?

12:11.272 --> 12:14.770
I thought maybe it's some type of aircraft.

12:14.771 --> 12:18.191
So I called the Air Base.

12:30.242 --> 12:33.586
The gentleman was very
cordial, very nonchalant.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.899
I, on the other hand, was
sort of embarrassed.

12:43.418 --> 12:44.718
I wanted an answer.

12:44.719 --> 12:47.349
And he was very kind about it,

12:47.350 --> 12:50.320
but he was very nonchalant and "no".
And just kinda brushed it off.

13:00.514 --> 13:04.366
I was going try to get to the
light, as quickly as possible.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.990
Just wanted to get this over with.

13:05.991 --> 13:09.021
I wanted to say that this is the
aircraft that this gentleman saw,

13:09.022 --> 13:11.312
and go finish my coffee.

13:11.313 --> 13:13.349
I went down the street.

13:13.350 --> 13:15.570
Probably another quarter of a mile.

13:15.571 --> 13:18.451
All of a sudden...

13:19.587 --> 13:23.967
Everything electronic in my vehicle dies.

13:31.304 --> 13:33.274
I'm going, what is going on here?

13:33.275 --> 13:39.175
Then I start turning my ignition
to try and start the car back up.

13:39.496 --> 13:45.034
I've never encountered anything like
this before, where a car just stops.

13:45.035 --> 13:47.468
It was a mechanical failure
and an electronic failure.

13:47.469 --> 13:50.529
The whole car failed.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.448
I remember bending over and
checking my portable radio.

13:55.449 --> 14:00.309
Trying to click it to
see if it was working.

14:01.294 --> 14:04.774
That wasn't working either.

14:05.136 --> 14:08.630
When you have no ability
to contact the 911 center.

14:08.631 --> 14:11.493
You're out there by yourself.

14:11.494 --> 14:14.297
I called for him over the radio.

14:14.298 --> 14:16.224
998, come in, 998.

14:16.225 --> 14:18.911
Toby typically would always pick right up.

14:18.912 --> 14:20.907
998, come in, 998.

14:20.908 --> 14:25.057
He did not right away, so
you call his number again.

14:25.058 --> 14:26.913
998, come in, 998.

14:26.914 --> 14:30.353
No response. 998, you read me? Come in.

14:30.354 --> 14:34.059
My Sergeant at that point he's listening
and okay, why isn't he answering? And...

14:34.060 --> 14:35.651
Toby, do you read me?

14:35.652 --> 14:37.782
He didn't respond again.

14:37.783 --> 14:40.044
Any unit that doesn't
answer, that's a crisis.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.125
So we started directing
units towards his location.

14:43.126 --> 14:44.465
We have an officer not responding.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.655
This went from playful and fun, ha ha ha,

14:46.656 --> 14:49.389
lights over Liberty, oh
yeah little green men.

14:49.390 --> 14:53.590
And now it's getting more concerning.

14:54.093 --> 14:59.993
I'm holding on to the steering wheel,
after I tried to restart the car.

15:01.767 --> 15:05.547
A huge light hit's my vehicle.

15:08.254 --> 15:10.594
Huge light.

15:11.307 --> 15:15.387
It's like it encompassed this tree.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.754
I'm going what, what is going on here?

15:19.755 --> 15:24.956
I'm thinking to myself I
need to exit the vehicle.

15:24.957 --> 15:28.137
I opened the car door.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.206
My hand goes right on my pistol.

15:35.207 --> 15:39.070
There's a double lot that's wooded,
and the object was hovering,

15:39.071 --> 15:42.170
directly over that wooded lot.

15:42.171 --> 15:44.232
It was huge.

15:44.233 --> 15:47.173
It was unbelievable.

16:01.933 --> 16:07.833
The light was so intense I had to shield
my eyes so I could look towards it.

16:09.057 --> 16:13.864
It's almost like you're looking up
at the sun on a sunny bright day.

16:13.865 --> 16:18.125
And you get those spots in your eyes.

16:18.512 --> 16:21.854
There was a structure there, but
it was so bright, so intense,

16:21.855 --> 16:26.895
there was no way of saying
exactly what it was.

16:27.471 --> 16:30.175
I would say it was the
size of a football field.

16:30.176 --> 16:31.487
100 yards.

16:31.488 --> 16:35.388
It was huge. It was unbelievable.

16:35.865 --> 16:39.737
And I'm saying could this be a
helicopter with huge lights on it?

16:39.738 --> 16:41.253
However there was no sound.

16:41.254 --> 16:43.166
Alright it can't be a helicopter.

16:43.167 --> 16:47.471
It's not any type of aircraft because
it's hovering over the tree line.

16:47.472 --> 16:50.292
What can this be?

16:51.983 --> 16:55.131
As I'm standing there, the
object begins to move off.

16:55.132 --> 17:00.652
And I began to see somewhat
of a shape of the object.

17:10.492 --> 17:13.181
Then I look, and my car is running again.

17:13.182 --> 17:15.339
998, 998 come in.

17:15.340 --> 17:17.449
I could hear my radio kick back on.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.800
998, do you read me? Come in.

17:19.801 --> 17:23.933
I could hear my call sign 998,
being called by Roy Anne.

17:23.934 --> 17:29.142
And you could hear concern in her voice as
she's you know, trying to get a hold of me.

17:30.471 --> 17:32.165
There was radio feedback.

17:32.166 --> 17:34.228
And all of a sudden Toby comes back on.

17:40.947 --> 17:42.643
What do you mean you have
to "collect your thoughts?"

17:42.644 --> 17:45.072
You had us worried about you, you
"have to collect your thoughts?"

17:45.073 --> 17:47.094
We're the ones worried about you.

17:49.007 --> 17:51.988
So, even thought I'm happy to hear
from him, I'm a little annoyed.

17:51.989 --> 17:56.232
We don't need any added drama what is
this, are you playing around with me?

17:56.233 --> 18:01.513
I just needed a few minutes
to collect my thoughts.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.203
I was overwhelmed.

18:06.397 --> 18:11.497
What happened to me didn't
make a lot of sense.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.470
I'm saying to myself, what the hell
I don't want to put that I saw

18:15.471 --> 18:20.567
a freaking UFO, over the air and
they think I'm crazy or something.

18:20.568 --> 18:25.527
What I wanted to do was call Roy Anne,
let her know what exactly I saw.

18:25.528 --> 18:26.931
I chose to use the phone.

18:26.932 --> 18:31.678
I didn't want to put information out on
the radio, so people think I'm nuts.

18:31.679 --> 18:34.337
- 998.
- Toby, go ahead.

18:34.338 --> 18:36.229
I'm okay, I'm back in service.

18:36.230 --> 18:40.438
He calls in and we have a
conversation over the phone.

18:40.439 --> 18:42.586
And I said you know, "What's
going on?" He says..

18:42.587 --> 18:45.039
"A UFO! I saw it".

18:45.040 --> 18:47.680
Did you really?

18:48.037 --> 18:51.637
I'm like okay, Toby. Don't!

18:51.714 --> 18:57.614
I used the word UFO, unidentified flying
object because I had no idea what this was.

18:57.752 --> 18:59.521
This is pretty far fetched.

18:59.522 --> 19:01.927
I really wanted to feel better
when I told you to go check this,

19:01.928 --> 19:04.686
I don't feel any better.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.959
I was not joking one
minute about what I saw.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.952
I told her, "Roy, I'm
being honest with you".

19:10.953 --> 19:15.593
"That is was what I saw. I
know it's unbelievable".

19:15.594 --> 19:18.623
- You could hear her voice come down.
- Are you sure it wasn't an an airplane?

19:18.624 --> 19:20.800
So, she kept on asking me questions.

19:20.801 --> 19:22.370
What the object looked like?

19:22.371 --> 19:24.848
What colors I saw, what it was doing?

19:24.849 --> 19:28.042
What direction it was heading in?

19:28.043 --> 19:31.816
And I understand that he's
had had a huge experience.

19:31.817 --> 19:37.517
But while he's processing that,
the radio started buzzing.

19:37.712 --> 19:39.264
Liberty dispatch, go ahead.

19:39.265 --> 19:42.478
Different officers were listening
over the open channels,

19:42.479 --> 19:47.409
started commenting on they're
seeing lights in the sky.

19:51.447 --> 19:53.361
5 miles away they're seeing it.

20:00.655 --> 20:02.624
And then, 5 miles in another direction.

20:09.196 --> 20:11.728
All the way up in to the
northern areas of our County.

20:17.073 --> 20:19.297
I jumped in my car...

20:19.298 --> 20:21.813
Activated my lights and sirens.

20:21.814 --> 20:25.760
I was going like it was a priority call.

20:25.761 --> 20:31.210
The object was heading south and looked
like it was going extremely fast.

20:31.211 --> 20:35.003
I'm trying to catch up and
cut through side streets.

20:35.004 --> 20:38.347
However I'm in a residential area.

20:38.348 --> 20:41.678
I was trying to find a direct line.

20:41.679 --> 20:45.647
I was cutting through every
street I could come across.

20:45.648 --> 20:49.117
I shouldn't say, how fast he was going.

20:49.118 --> 20:52.810
I was exceeding the speed limit.

20:52.811 --> 20:55.562
I could hear other police
trying to catch up too.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.303
You could hear everybody talking about it.

21:05.304 --> 21:08.155
Where did you see it, where
is it now, where it's going?

21:12.817 --> 21:17.268
The 911 center was holding calls because
everybody was consumed chasing this object.

21:17.269 --> 21:22.960
These are sergeants and seasoned veterans.
They were all excited about this.

21:29.563 --> 21:30.987
The room was buzzing.

21:41.332 --> 21:43.408
Brookfield had an officer.

21:43.409 --> 21:46.111
He'd climbed up an old radio tower.

21:46.112 --> 21:50.515
He was getting really vivid, vivid
accounts of the colors, of the shapes.

22:00.579 --> 22:02.059
He was really emphatic.

22:22.795 --> 22:25.086
I told Roy Anne you call the Air Base...

22:25.087 --> 22:28.164
And you let them know that we want
to know what the hell is going on.

22:28.165 --> 22:29.765
I called back to the Air Base.

22:33.508 --> 22:34.765
- Yes ma'am.
- And I say...

22:34.766 --> 22:38.847
Now we have people that are miles, and
miles and, miles and, and miles apart.

22:38.848 --> 22:42.060
They can see it, surely
you see something, right?

22:49.535 --> 22:51.749
And I'm thinking I don't understand this.

23:03.639 --> 23:08.714
I don't understand why they are denying
seeing that. Doesn't make sense.

23:08.715 --> 23:11.283
There's multiple jurisdictions.

23:11.284 --> 23:13.633
Multiple police departments.

23:13.634 --> 23:15.651
Multiple citizens seeing this.

23:15.652 --> 23:17.786
And I feel like they are
giving us a lot of "bull".

23:17.787 --> 23:20.710
Alright, I want to know what's going on.

23:20.711 --> 23:23.090
We were in a basement. I'm...

23:23.091 --> 23:27.330
All I'm getting is all the excitement of
everyone else who can experience this.

23:27.331 --> 23:28.831
I want to see it too.

23:28.832 --> 23:34.334
I got on the phone with another officer
and he said... "I'll come get you".

23:34.335 --> 23:36.851
I wasn't supposed to be there,
he wasn't supposed to take me,

23:36.852 --> 23:41.515
but I'm so wanting to see
what everyone else is seeing.

23:41.516 --> 23:44.907
We get on 82, and we could see the lights.

23:44.908 --> 23:46.920
I could see it off in the distance,

23:46.921 --> 23:52.821
but there was no way I could get underneath
it and get a clear look at what it was.

24:01.696 --> 24:04.636
We stopped the car.

24:05.894 --> 24:07.667
We get out on the side of the road...

24:07.668 --> 24:13.568
And he takes a pair of binoculars,
and he takes the first look.

24:14.888 --> 24:20.011
I see something hanging from the bottom,
like it's suspended and a red light on it.

24:20.012 --> 24:21.381
This is really weird.

24:21.382 --> 24:26.011
What sticks with me even now
is, that it was just still.

24:26.012 --> 24:27.312
Can you see that?

24:27.313 --> 24:31.120
Why am I not hearing it?
Why is it not moving?

24:31.121 --> 24:34.661
And then all of a sudden...

24:34.747 --> 24:37.687
It just shoots off.

24:38.286 --> 24:40.828
No noise, just phew!

24:40.829 --> 24:44.854
I'm just thinking to myself
what the heck just happened?

24:44.855 --> 24:50.755
We just kind of looked at each other
like, you did see that right?

24:50.810 --> 24:53.988
It was intense! Just that oh wow!

24:53.989 --> 24:58.429
I've never seen anything move like that.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.768
I was angry, I wanted to catch it.

25:01.769 --> 25:05.429
I wanted to see what it was.

25:05.597 --> 25:07.213
I just took a minute.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.151
I just wanted to separate
myself for a moment,

25:10.152 --> 25:14.445
from everything and just
reflect on what just happened.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.368
I have no idea what it was.

25:16.369 --> 25:20.065
It's nothing that I've seen or experienced.

25:20.066 --> 25:22.610
- Hi ya, Randal.
- Hey.

25:22.611 --> 25:25.791
I get teased endlessly.

25:26.295 --> 25:30.093
The other officers in this
got teased endlessly.

25:30.094 --> 25:32.348
Everybody denied seeing anything,

25:32.349 --> 25:37.809
or knowing anything about
anything going on that night.

25:38.378 --> 25:41.991
But I felt there was nothing
wrong with what happened.

25:41.992 --> 25:44.452
This was something that was inexplicable.

25:44.453 --> 25:49.703
This was something that happened
in the town that I live in.

25:49.704 --> 25:52.404
It's the truth.

25:53.656 --> 25:57.736
And I can't tell you what it was.

25:57.747 --> 26:00.987
I know what it wasn't.

26:03.461 --> 26:06.864
I know planes, I know helicopters, I
know weather balloons, I know planets.

26:06.865 --> 26:09.558
God, if this thing was a planet I
would have got a suntan from it.

26:09.559 --> 26:11.710
How close I was to it.

26:11.711 --> 26:14.605
It's one of those things
that just baffles you.

26:14.606 --> 26:19.300
In my mind I want to think that it was
something related to that Air Base.

26:19.301 --> 26:21.831
There's no resolution with anything else.

26:21.832 --> 26:23.277
I like resolution.

26:23.278 --> 26:27.109
I never believed in any type of
UFO's and that sort of thing.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.776
I still don't.

26:28.777 --> 26:33.517
But I see myself, saying to
myself, it's possible now.

26:33.518 --> 26:37.238
That's where I'm at with it.

26:56.141 --> 26:59.210
I am originally from Australia.

26:59.211 --> 27:03.098
I moved to The States in June of 2000.

27:03.099 --> 27:08.916
I have a son, Zack, from a previous
marriage, and I met Mike through a friend.

27:08.917 --> 27:11.904
I think you can say it was
love at first sight. Yep!

27:11.905 --> 27:15.584
We've now been together for
almost seven or eight years.

27:15.585 --> 27:20.465
Well, it was early 2008 that a friend
brought up about the Ouija Board.

27:20.466 --> 27:25.832
She told me, you know, she contacted
different spirits, and basically it works.

27:25.833 --> 27:30.270
I was definitely curious,
and also skeptical.

27:30.271 --> 27:34.711
So we decided to purchase our own board.

27:37.346 --> 27:40.842
I think part of the motivation
of getting on the board was,

27:40.843 --> 27:43.303
being able to get in contact with family.

27:43.304 --> 27:47.708
And we were just like amazed
when it started to work for us.

27:47.709 --> 27:51.254
Sometimes maybe going to the board
maybe two or three times a day.

27:51.255 --> 27:53.849
It kind of sucks you in.

27:53.850 --> 27:55.356
I didn't care for it much,

27:55.357 --> 27:59.442
because they kind of really
got in to like believing it.

27:59.443 --> 28:01.120
You guys aren't really
messing with that thing?

28:01.121 --> 28:04.765
They would ask it questions like,
"oh when will I get pregnant?"

28:04.766 --> 28:09.566
They really took everything
it said seriously.

28:09.608 --> 28:11.438
I heard that it could be dangerous,

28:11.439 --> 28:13.995
you don't know what you're
calling for, that sort of thing.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.992
But I think that once you find that,

28:15.993 --> 28:19.543
you're getting these questions answered
correctly time and time again,

28:19.544 --> 28:21.079
your skepticism's gone.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.603
You truly do believe.

28:23.604 --> 28:27.855
So for about a month we'd been using the
board and having a good time with it...

28:27.856 --> 28:29.203
- You ready?
- Yea.

28:29.204 --> 28:30.984
Then one day um...

28:30.985 --> 28:33.579
We said is there any friendly spirit here,

28:33.580 --> 28:38.980
who would like to come forth
and communicate with us?

28:39.340 --> 28:42.220
And, it said "no".

28:44.974 --> 28:46.852
The room felt different.

28:46.853 --> 28:48.361
Something weird going on.

28:48.362 --> 28:51.536
We both noticed it like right away.

28:51.537 --> 28:53.527
And we said, "who is this?"

28:53.528 --> 28:55.087
It spell's out... "V".

28:55.088 --> 28:56.103
"O".

28:56.104 --> 28:57.175
"X".

28:57.176 --> 28:59.036
Vox.

28:59.711 --> 29:02.086
What are we dealing with?

29:02.087 --> 29:07.307
And then all of a sudden,
things got really weird.

29:07.780 --> 29:11.684
It was out of control. Like,
chew, chew, chew, chew.

29:11.685 --> 29:16.730
It was scary. We're barely touching
it and it's just moving everywhere.

29:16.731 --> 29:20.966
It kept on saying the same stuff
over, and over and over, again

29:20.967 --> 29:24.447
it was all directed to me.

29:24.627 --> 29:26.524
He loved me.

29:26.525 --> 29:31.088
That Mike was lucky to be
able to sleep with me.

29:31.089 --> 29:34.029
I was a porn star.

29:34.171 --> 29:38.491
It was weird. Sickening. Nerve wracking.

29:38.645 --> 29:43.544
It was out of my hands, out of my
control, and it was frightening.

29:43.545 --> 29:49.445
We said "goodbye". And then it spelled
out "you never be rid of me".

29:49.760 --> 29:52.639
There's nothing you can do about it.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.776
All of a sudden it started counting down.

29:54.777 --> 29:55.786
10...

29:55.787 --> 29:57.186
9...

29:57.187 --> 29:58.244
8...

29:58.245 --> 29:59.294
7...

29:59.295 --> 30:00.344
6...

30:00.345 --> 30:02.205
5...

30:16.135 --> 30:18.174
All of a sudden it started counting down.

30:18.175 --> 30:20.095
10...

30:20.516 --> 30:22.352
9...

30:22.353 --> 30:24.055
8...

30:24.056 --> 30:25.916
7...

30:25.918 --> 30:27.778
6...

30:28.000 --> 30:29.860
5...

30:31.511 --> 30:33.671
Stop it!

30:34.414 --> 30:37.894
That really freaked me out.

30:37.955 --> 30:40.081
I'm like, what have we done?

30:40.082 --> 30:42.962
What have we done?

30:46.223 --> 30:47.947
We put the board in the closet.

30:47.948 --> 30:53.708
We put it up high, and we're
not touching it ever again.

30:55.133 --> 30:58.142
Basically, we'd forgotten the board.

30:58.143 --> 31:01.478
So for Christmas I found
out I was pregnant.

31:01.479 --> 31:06.159
And then in July of 2009 um, I had Brodie.

31:14.509 --> 31:19.462
It was spring 2010 when odd
things started happening.

31:19.463 --> 31:22.283
I was home alone.

31:29.752 --> 31:31.411
I heard footsteps.

31:31.412 --> 31:34.623
And not only footsteps, but there's
a loose board sort of up there.

31:34.624 --> 31:36.350
Zac.

31:36.351 --> 31:40.791
Did Zac come home, and I didn't notice?

31:46.823 --> 31:50.303
Not even just one footstep.

31:55.263 --> 31:57.665
I'm calling, "Zac, if you're
up here, just let me know".

31:57.666 --> 32:01.866
I just want to know if you're home.

32:07.313 --> 32:11.993
It doesn't feel good there. It feels heavy.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.005
I had the feeling that if I
turn my head quick enough,

32:21.006 --> 32:24.786
I'd see someone standing there.

32:25.682 --> 32:28.802
There's somebody here.

32:48.525 --> 32:51.354
Things started really picking up...

32:51.355 --> 32:54.775
From that November onwards.

32:55.580 --> 32:57.980
It's quiet.

32:58.928 --> 33:03.188
It was just me and her in the house.

33:03.343 --> 33:06.463
The baby was sleeping.

33:08.477 --> 33:11.061
And all of a sudden...

33:11.062 --> 33:13.962
Right between our heads.

33:13.963 --> 33:16.723
I got goosebumps.

33:16.884 --> 33:20.958
Something odd was happening in the house.

33:20.959 --> 33:24.979
It started to become more physical.

33:25.209 --> 33:28.124
I was in the kitchen by myself.

33:28.125 --> 33:32.805
And I felt a tug on the back of my shirt.

33:33.730 --> 33:36.054
There was nobody there.

33:36.055 --> 33:37.358
It was scary.

33:37.359 --> 33:40.807
We almost felt like it was
starting to take over the house.

33:40.808 --> 33:44.646
A couple of weeks later, Mike was
making himself something to eat.

33:44.647 --> 33:46.977
And as he walked out of the kitchen,

33:46.978 --> 33:49.089
I looked over and I said
"oh, what have you got?"

33:49.090 --> 33:52.330
And as he said pizza...

33:56.475 --> 33:59.931
I'm thinking it's starting to escalate.

33:59.932 --> 34:03.532
What's it going to do next?

34:10.799 --> 34:16.670
Just before Christmas, things started
to take a turn for the worse.

34:16.672 --> 34:20.847
It was Thanksgiving, so we
had a group of friends over.

34:20.848 --> 34:24.835
Everybody was relaxed, having a good time.

34:24.835 --> 34:28.060
We were sitting around talking and then,

34:28.061 --> 34:33.960
on the other side of the room,
Brodie's toys started going off.

34:39.045 --> 34:42.945
And, more toys started going off.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.985
So, by this stage we've got toys,

34:49.985 --> 34:53.610
spontaneously going off, going off,
going on, going off, going on.

34:53.612 --> 34:58.052
Lighting up, making noise, singing, music.

35:08.348 --> 35:12.138
And as rapid as it started, it
stopped again. It was done.

35:12.139 --> 35:14.327
It's kind of like it was toying with us.

35:14.328 --> 35:20.133
No one really knew what to say,
apart from that's really weird.

35:20.134 --> 35:23.494
They could wait to leave.

35:23.567 --> 35:26.597
That was just the turning
point right there.

35:26.598 --> 35:32.230
I really knew that I wasn't
alone in that house anymore.

35:32.231 --> 35:35.675
I was scared it was going
to hurt one of us.

35:35.676 --> 35:38.196
But we can't just up and leave,
we can't break the lease,

35:38.197 --> 35:41.595
we can't find somewhere to rent.

35:41.596 --> 35:47.496
So we figured that just try to deal
with this stuff as best we could.

35:47.541 --> 35:53.441
When it turned to night. You didn't
want to be in the house at all.

35:57.439 --> 36:02.140
You'll always feel a cold
chill coming down the stairs.

36:02.141 --> 36:08.041
The sense of something standing
there, watching you from above.

36:24.991 --> 36:28.136
I wouldn't walk with my
back against Brodie's door.

36:28.137 --> 36:32.243
I would just turn my body toward it.

36:32.244 --> 36:38.144
It was just like a sense if it was outside
of his room just kind of challenging you.

36:50.462 --> 36:55.322
That whole hallway was
just terrible at night.

36:56.075 --> 37:00.647
When I tried to go to sleep, I could
hear a whispering in my ears.

37:00.648 --> 37:04.728
I could feel tugging on the sheets.

37:06.762 --> 37:09.347
I'm just trying to ignore it.

37:09.348 --> 37:12.150
Suddenly I woke up.

37:12.151 --> 37:14.791
My leg felt it was on fire.

37:14.792 --> 37:17.778
I looked down, on my leg was a scratch.

37:17.779 --> 37:20.479
Six inches long.

37:22.723 --> 37:26.342
We hear blood curdling screams.

37:26.343 --> 37:32.243
I was scared of what I was going
to see, it was that horrible.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.816
And he's pointing, to the closet.

37:43.254 --> 37:47.214
It was shut when he went to bed.

37:52.564 --> 37:57.124
A couple of days later, it happened again.

38:00.338 --> 38:02.164
The closet doors are open again.

38:02.165 --> 38:04.335
I said that's it, I'm shutting them.

38:04.336 --> 38:07.396
I'm tying them shut.

38:08.331 --> 38:14.231
As I shut the door, I hear in his room,
the closet doors are just shaking.

38:28.358 --> 38:33.090
I was like, "there's something in
there, it was rattling those doors".

38:33.091 --> 38:36.991
No wonder this kid is so scared.

38:39.541 --> 38:43.741
That is what Brodie was dealing with.

38:47.013 --> 38:52.309
I was scared it was going to do
something much, much, worse.

38:52.310 --> 38:57.467
You can feel it around you,
but how do you fight that?

38:57.468 --> 39:00.348
You can't see it.

39:05.759 --> 39:10.051
It was just an average
day, Mike was at work.

39:10.052 --> 39:13.378
And Brodie was waking up
from his afternoon nap.

39:13.379 --> 39:15.801
And I went up the stairs to get him.

39:15.802 --> 39:17.196
Hello, little man.

39:17.197 --> 39:20.071
He was babbling to himself
when I went in to pick him up.

39:20.072 --> 39:24.392
I was just turning out of the doorway.

39:28.327 --> 39:30.272
I realized, oh my God, this is it!

39:30.273 --> 39:33.753
It's showing itself to me.

39:34.114 --> 39:37.440
It was this black figure.

39:37.441 --> 39:40.321
I moved back out and it was still there.

39:40.322 --> 39:43.262
And, glanced back...

39:45.656 --> 39:47.995
And it was gone.

39:47.996 --> 39:50.428
I just knew I had to get out.

39:50.429 --> 39:55.116
I couldn't stand being
there a second longer.

39:55.117 --> 39:58.944
I'm pretty much freaking out now
like, who was this house, you know?

39:58.945 --> 40:01.983
It just felt like you were about
to get attacked or something.

40:01.984 --> 40:05.587
I just knew then and there,
that we had to take a stand.

40:05.588 --> 40:09.368
We had to take our house back.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.798
We were a little bit skeptical
about going to a church,

40:15.799 --> 40:18.088
and saying this is what
is going on in our house.

40:18.089 --> 40:19.596
- Grey Wolf?
- Yes, I am.

40:19.597 --> 40:22.204
We were put in contact with Grey Wolf.

40:22.205 --> 40:28.085
She was very frightened, with
things that had been happening.

40:29.913 --> 40:32.780
My attention was drawn to the stairs.

40:32.781 --> 40:37.707
You can feel every hair
stand up on your body.

40:37.708 --> 40:40.099
All of the hair on your arms.

40:40.100 --> 40:44.724
And that's when I asked her, what else is
up here that you haven't told me about?

40:44.725 --> 40:47.617
And she started explaining
about the Ouija Board.

40:47.618 --> 40:48.660
This cupboard?

40:48.661 --> 40:51.417
It was in a closet,

40:51.418 --> 40:57.318
that was directly connected, to
the closet in the baby's room.

41:00.036 --> 41:03.379
He told me, "it is attached to you".

41:03.380 --> 41:06.122
It's attached to you
through the Ouija Board.

41:06.123 --> 41:10.323
That's when I realized it was "Vox".

41:11.337 --> 41:13.697
I felt sick. Tears welled up.

41:13.698 --> 41:17.034
I felt ashamed, I felt mad at myself.

41:17.035 --> 41:21.435
He said, we need to get
rid of the Ouija Board.

41:21.436 --> 41:26.774
Water is the one element that
doesn't allow spirits travel.

41:26.775 --> 41:30.499
We had a kiddie pool for Brodie,
so we decided to use that.

41:30.500 --> 41:35.870
We wrapped the board and a personal item
of mine, seeing as it was attached to me.

41:35.871 --> 41:40.721
And he said before we put it in there,
you need to be firm and tell it...

41:40.722 --> 41:44.432
"It's got to go. It's no longer welcome".

41:44.433 --> 41:49.140
We put in to the water, weighed it
down, and to help keep it submerged,

41:49.141 --> 41:53.701
we had a gallon jug to place on the top.

41:57.250 --> 42:00.583
As soon as Grey Wolf finished,
the house felt lighter.

42:00.584 --> 42:03.404
It looked lighter.

42:04.392 --> 42:08.969
Like the storm just passed,
and everything just lit up.

42:08.970 --> 42:12.150
We had our house back.

42:39.002 --> 42:42.464
We made a mistake of messing
with Ouija Board's.

42:42.465 --> 42:45.839
Now I know that the other side is real.

42:45.840 --> 42:50.255
I wish I could say it was just a
bad dream, but it was my life.
