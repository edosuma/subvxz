Make up your mind.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.985

- Hey, Emma.

13:46.855 --> 13:48.622
Is, uh, is Norma around?

13:48.724 --> 13:50.191
I think she's up at the house.

13:50.292 --> 13:51.592
Oh, okay.

13:51.693 --> 13:53.060
You seen, uh, Norman?

13:53.161 --> 13:55.563
Is something going on?

13:55.664 --> 13:57.131
What do you mean?

13:57.232 --> 13:58.432
Well, Norma came in
looking for him earlier.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.402
Is something wrong?

14:01.503 --> 14:04.505
No, no, no, nothing's wrong, no.

14:08.343 --> 14:10.077
You know, I'm a person.

14:10.178 --> 14:11.645
With feelings and a brain. I'm
getting really sick of this.

14:11.747 --> 14:15.683
Why is everyone just
completely ignoring me?

14:15.784 --> 14:19.706
Maybe you should take a
break, get some fresh air.

14:21.723 --> 14:23.124
[Door slams]

14:23.225 --> 14:26.227
Maybe I should.

14:28.230 --> 14:29.663
Norma.

14:29.765 --> 14:32.400
- Oh, hey, Alex.
- What's up?

14:32.501 --> 14:35.403
It's just, I was wondering
how Norman's doing.

14:35.504 --> 14:37.204
Uh, he's very sick, actually.

14:37.305 --> 14:39.306
He's got a bad cold, fever, you know.

14:39.408 --> 14:41.842
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

14:41.943 --> 14:43.444
But I'd like to talk to him.

14:43.545 --> 14:45.746
- To Norman?
- Yeah. It's important.

14:45.847 --> 14:47.515
Well, that's impossible right now.

14:47.616 --> 14:49.517
- He's very contagious.
- I don't mind.

14:49.618 --> 14:51.619
Well, what's so important
that you need to speak to him?

14:51.720 --> 14:53.120
Did he mention anything to you
about the talk he and I had?

14:53.221 --> 14:54.321
- No.
- Did he?

14:54.423 --> 14:55.790
No.

14:59.461 --> 15:01.796
[Sighs]

15:01.897 --> 15:04.799
All right, look, there's
no gentle way to put this.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.668
During Blaire Watson's autopsy,

15:07.769 --> 15:10.071
two semen samples were found inside her.

15:10.172 --> 15:11.539
One was Kyle Miller's.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.140
The man they've convicted of killing her.

15:13.241 --> 15:15.142
That's right.

15:15.243 --> 15:17.478
The other one belonged to Norman.

15:20.882 --> 15:23.484
Um...

15:26.087 --> 15:28.489
What do you mean? It's impossible.

15:28.590 --> 15:29.990
- It's impossible.
- No.

15:30.091 --> 15:32.426
No, it's not only possible; It's factual.

15:32.527 --> 15:34.028
Norma, we ran his DNA

15:34.129 --> 15:36.030
after the Jimmy Brennen incident.

15:36.131 --> 15:37.665
What does this mean?

15:37.766 --> 15:39.667
It means Norman had sex with Blaire Watson

15:39.768 --> 15:41.302
very close to when she was murdered,

15:41.403 --> 15:42.736
and that's why I need to talk to him.

15:42.837 --> 15:46.707
Norma, I need to know what happened.

15:46.808 --> 15:48.275
I want him to take a polygraph test.

15:48.376 --> 15:50.811
- But why?
- I think that's obvious.

15:50.912 --> 15:53.414
Well, polygraphs aren't
even admissible in court.

15:53.515 --> 15:55.516
Well, regardless, virtually
every law enforcement

15:55.617 --> 15:57.751
and National Security Agency
in the country uses them.

15:57.852 --> 16:02.323
I-I'm not asking.

16:02.424 --> 16:03.791
Okay. He's sleeping right now.

16:03.892 --> 16:06.994
I don't want to wake him. He's very sick.

16:07.095 --> 16:08.462
He's not going anywhere.

16:08.563 --> 16:10.831
It can wait a bit. Please?

16:10.932 --> 16:14.768
Please, let me just talk
to him first, please, Alex?

16:14.869 --> 16:16.637
He's not going anywhere, right?

16:16.738 --> 16:19.807
No. No, I promise. I promise.

16:19.908 --> 16:22.309
All right. Okay. I'll be back.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.032
what the average John Doe is like,

17:46.133 --> 17:47.567
you couldn't tell him

17:47.668 --> 17:51.037
because he's a million and one things.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.740
He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small.

17:54.842 --> 17:57.443
He's simple and he's wise.

17:57.544 --> 17:58.878
He's inherently honest,

17:58.979 --> 18:01.647
but he's got a streak
of larceny in his heart.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.483
He seldom walks up to a public telephone

18:03.584 --> 18:05.985
without shoving his finger into the slot

to see if somebody left a nickel there.

the Bates Motel is a family business,

21:28.373 --> 21:30.708
part of the family in some ways,

me about, like what happened

29:44.674 --> 29:46.675
[Chuckles]

29:50.514 --> 29:54.350
Now, you can tell Jodi
thank you for the groceries.

29:54.451 --> 29:57.453
And tell her we need to
get Nick Ford off the map.

30:01.224 --> 30:02.725
Okay.

30:02.826 --> 30:05.494
- Convince her of it.
- I'll try.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.597
Good.

30:20.310 --> 30:22.478
Drive safe.

30:37.509 --> 30:39.404
You can close up for the night, Emma.

30:40.421 --> 30:41.530
Okay.

30:44.258 --> 30:46.259
[Clears throat]

30:51.099 --> 30:53.000
It's George.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.103
Oh, shit.

31:03.277 --> 31:05.679
Hey.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.981
[Door closes]

31:08.082 --> 31:10.984
Hey, Norma.

31:11.085 --> 31:12.986
Uh, I'll just be leaving.

31:13.087 --> 31:15.088
Good night.

31:20.762 --> 31:22.662
These are for you.

31:22.764 --> 31:25.065
That is so sweet.

31:25.166 --> 31:27.167
[Insects chirping]

31:38.980 --> 31:40.614
I had a good time last night.

31:40.715 --> 31:42.949
Yeah.

31:43.051 --> 31:46.420
[Laughs uncomfortably]

31:46.521 --> 31:48.655
Uh, George, you know what?

31:48.756 --> 31:50.590
Not right now. I'm sorry.

31:50.691 --> 31:53.660
Not right now.

31:53.761 --> 31:55.095
Oh. I get it.

31:55.196 --> 31:58.365
Two steps forward, one step back?

31:58.466 --> 32:01.468
No. I-I've just had a hard day.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.440
Fair enough.

32:06.541 --> 32:08.108
Well, thanks for chiming in.

32:08.209 --> 32:10.944
I wouldn't have felt it was fair otherwise.

32:11.045 --> 32:12.312
What the hell, Norma?

32:12.413 --> 32:14.648
I... you know... I don't get you.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.383
What is it, some weird control thing?

32:16.484 --> 32:18.018
- I really don't get it.
- You want to know why

32:18.119 --> 32:20.420
you don't get me? Because you can't get me.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.322
You will never get me.

32:22.423 --> 32:23.924
You think you know what life is,

32:24.025 --> 32:25.392
that it's something you just stay on top of

32:25.493 --> 32:27.527
with your soft words and
your nice summer jacket?

32:27.628 --> 32:29.062
You come from a whole world of people

32:29.163 --> 32:31.164
who are not real.

32:31.265 --> 32:32.632
You don't understand anything.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.101
You're just sleepwalking through life.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.902
You have no real troubles.

32:36.003 --> 32:37.404
You sit there in your little playhouses

32:37.505 --> 32:39.406
with your cocktails, and
you judge the rest of us.

32:39.507 --> 32:41.174
- That's total bullshit.
- Then why don't you

32:41.275 --> 32:43.009
get the hell out of here then?

32:51.352 --> 32:53.320
Done.

33:00.027 --> 33:02.929
[Sentimental music]

33:09.103 --> 33:11.605
- George!
- [Engine turns over]

33:11.706 --> 33:14.341
George! George, I'm sorry!

33:14.442 --> 33:17.444
I'm sorry!

33:24.051 --> 33:26.086
Norma?

33:26.187 --> 33:28.221
- [Sobbing]
- Oh.

33:28.322 --> 33:32.058
Ohh.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.095
I'm sorry, Norma.

33:35.196 --> 33:37.330
Come on. Come on.

33:37.431 --> 33:40.433
It's okay.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.739
[Dove cooing]

34:06.627 --> 34:10.297
This way.

34:10.398 --> 34:12.399
[Clock ticking]

34:26.045 --> 34:29.616
Thank you for coming over, Dylan.

34:29.717 --> 34:31.684
How are you?

34:31.784 --> 34:33.520
I've been better.

34:33.621 --> 34:35.822
I'm sure you have.

34:35.922 --> 34:38.791
Look, none of us wanted this.

34:38.893 --> 34:40.592
I didn't want to do it.

34:40.694 --> 34:43.295
You didn't want me to have to do it.

34:43.397 --> 34:46.599
But unfortunately Zane
Morgan made it necessary.

34:46.699 --> 34:49.702
He's the one responsible for all of this.

34:52.672 --> 34:54.541
So.

34:54.641 --> 34:58.745
You have news for me?

34:58.846 --> 35:01.214
Yeah, I know where you can find Zane.

35:01.315 --> 35:04.183
His body?

35:04.285 --> 35:08.555
He's not dead.

35:08.656 --> 35:10.723
I don't understand.

35:10.824 --> 35:12.859
I don't think I could've
made myself more clear.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.761
I couldn't get to him.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.296
All right, he's holed up in a house

35:16.397 --> 35:18.598
with three other guys, all armed.

35:18.699 --> 35:21.568
There's no way for me to do it.

35:21.669 --> 35:23.570
Where?

35:23.671 --> 35:26.205
Way up cedar canyon,
all the way at the end.

35:26.307 --> 35:27.507
There's a dirt road to the left

35:27.608 --> 35:28.775
in a house at the end of that road.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.777
You know for sure he's there?

35:30.878 --> 35:32.845
Yeah, I was up there. I saw him.

35:32.947 --> 35:35.582
I pretended I was there
to take him groceries.

35:35.683 --> 35:39.385
You have any thoughts about
how we can get this done?

35:39.486 --> 35:41.554
You're gonna have to go up
there with a bunch of guys.

35:41.655 --> 35:44.757
Have a firefight?

35:44.858 --> 35:48.428
I don't see it any other way.

35:48.529 --> 35:49.862
So what you're telling me

35:49.964 --> 35:54.667
is you can't help me anymore.

35:54.768 --> 35:57.770
Not by myself.

36:00.641 --> 36:03.509
All right.

36:03.611 --> 36:07.180
Well.

36:07.281 --> 36:08.748
I'm really sorry to hear that.

36:08.849 --> 36:11.618
[Gun cocks]

36:11.719 --> 36:14.821
- Let's go.
- Go where?

36:14.922 --> 36:16.956
Outside.

36:17.057 --> 36:20.627
[Foreboding music]

36:20.728 --> 36:22.328
[Grunts, shouts]

36:22.429 --> 36:25.331
[Both grunting]

36:36.477 --> 36:38.277
Where's Norman?

36:38.379 --> 36:41.214
Where is he? Where's Norman?

36:41.315 --> 36:43.216
Where is he?

36:43.317 --> 36:45.551
Where did you take him?

37:02.983 --> 37:05.084
[pounding at door]

37:05.185 --> 37:08.921
[Doorbell rings, pounding continues]

37:24.938 --> 37:26.438
Here to see Norman.

37:26.539 --> 37:27.706
I told you, he's not feeling...

37:27.807 --> 37:29.842
No, no, no, I know what you told me.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.744
I need to see him in the flesh right now.

37:31.845 --> 37:33.145
Okay, as soon as he's
up, I'll send him down.

37:33.246 --> 37:34.680
- No, you're not hearing me.
- I'm...

37:34.781 --> 37:36.448
I'm tired of being nice about it.

37:36.549 --> 37:37.916
- Out of my way.
- You can't!

37:38.018 --> 37:39.618
Come on, you don't have
permission to be here.

37:39.719 --> 37:40.853
Yeah, well, call
somebody. Whoever you want.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.589
Why are you doing this?

37:43.690 --> 37:47.126
Okay, he's not there.

37:56.569 --> 37:58.203
Where is he?

37:58.305 --> 37:59.805
Where is he?

37:59.906 --> 38:04.143
Nick Ford has him.

38:04.244 --> 38:05.678
He took him. He said if I told anyone,

38:05.779 --> 38:06.879
he would kill him.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.981
- What?
- He's evil.

38:09.082 --> 38:10.716
He's pure evil. I should've listened to you

38:10.817 --> 38:12.685
and stayed away from him.

38:12.786 --> 38:14.553
I-I thought that he could
help me stop the road.

38:14.654 --> 38:17.189
I'm an idiot. He took advantage of me.

38:17.290 --> 38:19.892
Why did he do it? Did he tell you why?

38:19.993 --> 38:21.593
To force Dylan to kill somebody.

38:21.695 --> 38:23.696
[Sighs]

38:26.199 --> 38:27.499
All right. Okay. I'm on it.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.734
What are you gonna do about it?

38:28.835 --> 38:30.069
Please stop asking me that question.

38:30.104 --> 38:31.516
I trust you, okay? I totally trust you.

38:31.579 --> 38:32.680
Well, then let me take care of it.

38:32.781 --> 38:35.783
Okay.

38:38.553 --> 38:41.555
[Breathing shakily]

38:41.656 --> 38:43.657
Come on.

38:43.758 --> 38:44.892
[Thunder rumbles]

38:44.993 --> 38:47.895
[Throbbing music]

38:49.197 --> 38:50.597
Norman!

38:50.699 --> 38:51.999
What are you doing walking in the rain?

38:52.100 --> 38:53.233
Come on, get in!

38:56.338 --> 38:58.472
[Faint heartbeat]

38:58.573 --> 39:01.575
You probably shouldn't tell
anyone that you came here.

39:03.712 --> 39:04.945
I'm going to go change quickly.

39:05.046 --> 39:06.847
Ahh.

39:06.948 --> 39:08.782
What kind of a grown woman

39:08.883 --> 39:10.851
invites a teenage boy into her house

39:10.952 --> 39:12.686
and changes her clothes
where he can see her?

39:12.787 --> 39:15.756
- That's not what she's doing.
- Of course it is.

39:15.857 --> 39:17.091
No, no, no. She's trying to help me.

39:17.192 --> 39:18.258
She's trying to seduce you.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.494
That's not true.

39:20.595 --> 39:23.497
[Eerie, sultry music]

39:26.034 --> 39:27.134
[Whispers] Norman.

39:35.076 --> 39:39.012
Norman.

39:39.114 --> 39:40.280
Then why didn't she close the door?

39:40.382 --> 39:42.549
Because.

39:42.650 --> 39:43.817
Because she knows you're watching her.

39:43.918 --> 39:46.253
- She does not.
- Of course she does.

39:46.354 --> 39:47.654
She wants you to see her body.

39:47.756 --> 39:49.957
- She wants you to want her.
- Stop!

39:50.058 --> 39:53.827
[Heartbeat]

39:53.928 --> 39:56.830
[Whispers] Norman.

39:59.968 --> 40:02.836
Norman. [Sighs erotically]

40:06.007 --> 40:08.976
Norman...

40:09.077 --> 40:10.911
You know what you have to do.

40:11.012 --> 40:13.881
[Moaning softly]

40:13.982 --> 40:16.884
[Ominous music]

40:28.096 --> 40:29.663
I'm always with you.

40:29.764 --> 40:32.065
I'm always with you.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.645
