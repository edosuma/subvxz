00:09.530 --> 00:12.480
This is Skeltoft Farm Camp.

00:12.530 --> 00:15.480
We offer good work in
a variety of sectors,

00:15.530 --> 00:17.480
liaising with the Home Office,

00:17.530 --> 00:20.481
ensuring that all immigration
paperwork is bang up to date.

00:20.531 --> 00:23.481
Warm, comfortable accommodation,

00:23.531 --> 00:25.841
with a choice of private or shared rooms.

00:25.891 --> 00:28.161
Your every need is catered for,

00:28.211 --> 00:30.481
with communal kitchens and laundries.

00:30.531 --> 00:34.481
I'm Darren Bailey, owner
of Skeltoft Farm Camp.

00:34.531 --> 00:38.531
Skeltoft, it's a great
place to live and work.

01:12.053 --> 01:14.483
What are you shooting at, the ozone layer?

01:14.533 --> 01:17.483
- There hasn't been a bird all morning.
- Yeah, I know.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.533
I just like firing the ruddy thing.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.494
You're right, though.
There's nowt happening here.

01:22.534 --> 01:24.324
There's no bloody beaters.

01:24.374 --> 01:26.484
Home Office immigration crackdown.

01:26.534 --> 01:29.164
Every time they send out
those enforcement vans,

01:29.214 --> 01:31.324
half the county disappears underground.

01:31.374 --> 01:33.484
If I knew he was coming,
I would have worn a wire.

01:33.534 --> 01:36.484
Now, then, Oleg. Won't you
lend us a couple of your lads?

01:36.534 --> 01:38.484
Yeah, they're good at beating.

01:38.534 --> 01:40.484
Your nation's reliance on migrant labour

01:40.534 --> 01:42.095
is going to destroy it from the inside.

01:42.119 --> 01:44.485
- So you're not a migrant?
- I'm not slave labour.

01:44.535 --> 01:46.485
I'm a high-net-worth individual.

01:46.535 --> 01:48.535
Like us.

02:02.536 --> 02:04.326
You're welcome.

02:04.376 --> 02:06.166
But I'm not Polish.

02:06.216 --> 02:09.485
- Charlene Bailey.
- You're Darren Bailey's daughter?

02:09.536 --> 02:11.486
He was supposed to join us today.

02:11.536 --> 02:13.486
- Er, he had something come up.
- Aye.

02:13.536 --> 02:17.166
A bottle of Jose Cuervo and the
kebab that he had after it,

02:17.216 --> 02:18.536
knowing your dad?

02:35.537 --> 02:37.167
Yep.

02:37.217 --> 02:39.487
This is what I joined up for.

02:39.537 --> 02:42.487
Investigating fly-tipping.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.488
That's going to make a mess of your car.

02:44.538 --> 02:46.738
Maklov 1000.

02:47.578 --> 02:49.538
Sounds foreign.

02:52.514 --> 02:53.514
What are you doing?

02:53.538 --> 02:56.008
- There could be anything in there.
- Yeah, there could be.

02:56.058 --> 02:59.488
There could be hard drugs, there
could be the Hitler diaries,

02:59.538 --> 03:02.488
weapons of mass destruction,
plutonium, whatever.

03:02.538 --> 03:05.219
If it washes up somewhere,
it'll be West Lincs'.

03:06.539 --> 03:08.539
They can deal with it. I'm off.

03:10.539 --> 03:12.539
West Lincs is that way.

03:27.516 --> 03:28.916
I'm glad you've made a friend here.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.490
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.490
You know, you both have a lot in common.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.490
Your parents are both cops.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.490
You're kind of outsiders.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.490
He's gay. You're American.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.490
It's like you designed him yourself.

03:39.540 --> 03:42.490
A cop's son with no interest
in dating your daughter.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.490
Do you really think I'm that controlling?

03:44.540 --> 03:45.717
Please. If you could create an algorithm

03:45.741 --> 03:47.531
that would predict my
behaviour, you would.

03:47.581 --> 03:49.541
What makes you think I haven't?

03:51.541 --> 03:53.491
So, I guess I'm no longer grounded?

03:56.641 --> 03:57.991
Man, she's good.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.492
I have no idea why I'm doing this.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.492
Because Keith's going.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.492
And why is Keith going?

04:16.541 --> 04:18.492
Because he likes to have his photo taken

04:18.541 --> 04:20.492
in front of the immigration
enforcement vans.

04:20.541 --> 04:21.492
It plays to his electorate.

04:21.541 --> 04:24.492
So, I'm spending my day watching
my force protect immigration teams

04:24.542 --> 04:26.493
so Keith can get re-elected?

04:26.543 --> 04:28.493
You were hired to get Keith re-elected.

04:28.543 --> 04:30.543
Don't you love democracy?

04:33.543 --> 04:35.543
All right, boys, let's go put on a show!

04:36.543 --> 04:38.493
You almost look like real cops.

04:38.543 --> 04:40.543
Skeltoft is a lot like Compton, sir.

04:41.543 --> 04:43.543
Just more polka, less hip-hop.

04:44.543 --> 04:46.744
Right, best we go and
babysit Border Control.

04:53.744 --> 04:55.544
Keep moving.

05:07.065 --> 05:09.665
- Welcome to the front line, Bill.
- I almost feel at home.

05:10.545 --> 05:13.545
All you need is a 30-foot wall
and some better Mexican food.

05:14.545 --> 05:15.695
You remember Charlene.

05:15.745 --> 05:17.495
You have a problem with your permits?

05:17.545 --> 05:20.495
My dad usually sorts all of this stuff.

05:20.545 --> 05:23.495
I told the enforcement officer
to wait, but he's not listening.

05:23.545 --> 05:26.545
- Hurry up. Get in the van.
- My wife is with me!

05:30.546 --> 05:32.496
Here. Give it to me.

05:32.546 --> 05:34.626
You entertain the gentleman
with the expensive shoes.

05:34.650 --> 05:37.496
- Hurry up!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.626
I know you have your quota,
but I have my quota, too.

05:39.650 --> 05:43.496
And these workers are late to
pick your two-for-one broccoli.

05:43.546 --> 05:45.496
- Let's go.
- This is a joke.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.496
These five have permits, you idiot.

05:47.546 --> 05:49.747
It looks like you lot jumped the gun.
Fuck you!

05:55.547 --> 05:58.497
- Who's that?
- That's Lubica.

05:58.547 --> 06:00.547
Dad's girlfriend.

06:01.547 --> 06:03.497
Lucky old Dad.

06:03.547 --> 06:06.497
You do yoga, Charlene? The mala bracelet?

06:06.547 --> 06:07.697
I used to, yeah.

06:07.747 --> 06:10.498
Used to do a lot of things, did Charl.

06:10.548 --> 06:13.178
Yoga, pilates, meditation...
You name it, she's quit it.

06:13.228 --> 06:15.178
We haven't met.

06:15.228 --> 06:18.178
I'm DJ. This is my brother Matthew.

06:18.228 --> 06:22.498
Sorry Dad's not here. Keith knows
his way to his drinks cabinet, mind.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.548
Yeah, well, nowt changes,
does it? Come on.

06:25.548 --> 06:28.018
- What's up with you?
- Get in.

06:28.068 --> 06:29.499
Do I recognise you?

06:29.549 --> 06:31.499
- Erm, Muriel Yeardsley.
- Muriel, from school?

06:31.549 --> 06:33.069
Yeah!

06:34.549 --> 06:36.859
Muriel, it's been...

06:36.909 --> 06:40.499
six days now since I last saw my dad.

06:40.549 --> 06:42.499
He's not answering his phone?

06:42.549 --> 06:45.549
He can't, can he? Cos he left it behind.

06:51.550 --> 06:55.230
Immigration officers...
Knobheads, the lot of them.

07:00.590 --> 07:03.020
So, you went to school with her?

07:03.070 --> 07:05.500
The teachers used her
as a cautionary tale.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.500
You know, "Don't do a Bailey," they'd say.

07:07.550 --> 07:10.551
Drink, drugs, she got pregnant at 14.

07:11.911 --> 07:14.551
14? Jesus, my daughter's 14.

07:15.551 --> 07:17.501
Well, she's right to be worried.

07:17.551 --> 07:19.551
See what you can find on that phone.

07:24.551 --> 07:27.501
The password to Darren Bailey's
phone is DJ's birthday.

07:27.551 --> 07:30.502
The 8th of the 9th 1989. 8989.

07:30.552 --> 07:32.502
His son and heir.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.072
Any data on the SIM?

07:35.552 --> 07:37.502
There's something gnarly, sir.

07:37.552 --> 07:40.502
He's got access to the
camp's CCTV on his phone.

07:40.552 --> 07:41.632
There's cameras everywhere.

07:41.656 --> 07:43.502
The Polish lads on my farm

07:43.552 --> 07:46.502
say that Darren Bailey
is a total control freak.

07:46.552 --> 07:49.502
He always seems to know what people
are up to. And now we know how.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.503
- Any sign of him leaving the camp?
- Not yet.

07:51.553 --> 07:53.503
But, I mean, there's loads of it.

07:53.553 --> 07:55.553
Who's that?

07:58.553 --> 08:00.503
It's his girlfriend.

08:00.553 --> 08:02.503
She's in a nightgown in the rain.

08:02.553 --> 08:04.503
Is that the night he left?

08:04.553 --> 08:06.503
Yeah, it is.

08:06.553 --> 08:09.503
I suppose I'd better go down
there, have a quiet chat.

08:09.553 --> 08:10.503
Take Drakes and Cobley with you.

08:10.553 --> 08:12.554
I don't want you going down there alone.

08:14.554 --> 08:15.554
What's she doing?

08:17.554 --> 08:19.554
More like, what has she done?

08:26.554 --> 08:28.504
Why are we back here?

08:28.554 --> 08:30.504
What do you think is in that case?

08:30.554 --> 08:33.505
It's more what I'm hoping is not in there.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.505
Caught yourself a conscience?

08:35.554 --> 08:38.505
Well, the question is, what's more stupid,

08:38.554 --> 08:41.865
kicking it in the river or
coming back here to fish it out?

08:41.914 --> 08:44.505
Aye. It is a dilemma.

08:44.555 --> 08:45.505
Hey...

08:45.555 --> 08:47.025
There you go.

08:47.075 --> 08:48.555
You can settle it.

08:59.596 --> 09:01.076
Come on.

09:03.056 --> 09:04.556
There you go.

09:50.558 --> 09:52.398
I'm sorry.

09:54.239 --> 09:56.559
Your dad was found near Frith Bank.

10:05.559 --> 10:08.509
How? How was he killed?

10:08.559 --> 10:12.509
The pathologist believes it was
a blow to the back of the head.

10:12.559 --> 10:15.560
It's still early days, so
there's tests to be done.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.710
Come on, Charlene.
There's 400 in this camp

10:21.760 --> 10:24.510
and 90% of them would
happily slit our throats.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.190
We're trying to talk here, Charl.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.510
She can cry wherever she wants.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.560
It's her home too, right? And her father.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.921
Dad's gone. Why are you still here?

10:37.561 --> 10:39.511
I cared for your father, DJ.

10:39.561 --> 10:42.511
You cared for him? I
thought you loved him?

10:42.561 --> 10:43.511
At least his money.

10:43.561 --> 10:47.191
He always knew you were
shagging around behind his back.

10:47.241 --> 10:49.511
Do not speak nonsense, you little man!

10:49.561 --> 10:52.511
All right, easy. We're
just talking to her.

10:52.561 --> 10:55.512
That night, she was ranting
and raving like a maniac.

10:55.562 --> 10:58.512
- I heard her through the walls.
- I wasn't ranting at him, DJ.

10:58.562 --> 11:00.562
I was fucking him!

11:02.562 --> 11:05.242
I want you out. Now!

11:07.562 --> 11:09.562
Lubica!

11:19.563 --> 11:22.513
So, you think the same? I
was fucking him for money.

11:22.563 --> 11:25.033
But earlier on...?

11:25.083 --> 11:27.513
I mean, I wasn't fucking
him for his looks.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.513
A marriage of convenience.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.513
Yeah, without the marriage.

11:31.563 --> 11:33.513
Or is your marriage less convenient?

11:33.563 --> 11:35.763
Less convenient, the way it ended.

11:38.564 --> 11:42.514
I thought he would come through this
door full of sorries and presents.

11:42.564 --> 11:46.514
We saw you on CCTV in
your nightgown in the rain.

11:46.564 --> 11:48.564
You looked pretty upset.

11:49.564 --> 11:52.514
He's right. We did have an argument.

11:52.564 --> 11:54.564
Not unusual for us.

11:57.565 --> 11:59.515
Economics degree?

11:59.565 --> 12:02.565
It might surprise you to hear,
this wasn't the life I dreamt of.

12:03.565 --> 12:05.515
Where will you go?

12:05.565 --> 12:08.515
Dorm eight has a spare bed.

12:08.565 --> 12:10.515
I rejoin the picking gang tomorrow.

12:10.565 --> 12:12.515
Here...

12:12.565 --> 12:13.565
Let me help you.

12:25.406 --> 12:27.566
Why would somebody do this to Dad?

12:29.246 --> 12:31.516
Did the company have any trouble?

12:31.566 --> 12:34.516
You know, unpaid debts or disputes.

12:34.566 --> 12:36.566
Dad didn't say anything. Not to me.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.567
I'm sure you know, I was in rehab.

12:41.567 --> 12:44.567
I guess I'm a fuck-up next
to someone like you?

12:46.567 --> 12:48.607
We all fuck up. Believe me.

12:51.567 --> 12:55.567
Dorm rooms, kitchen, the bus picks
up at 7:00am, drops off at 7:00pm.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.518
Is your dryer broken?

12:58.568 --> 13:00.518
Dryers and washers, £4 a load.

13:00.568 --> 13:02.518
That's why we use the greenhouse.

13:02.568 --> 13:04.518
£2 if you want to get your phone charged.

13:04.568 --> 13:07.568
They don't seem that cut up about Darren.

13:08.568 --> 13:10.558
Do they hate him that much?

13:10.608 --> 13:12.518
Can you blame them?

13:12.568 --> 13:16.518
Immigrants lead shitty
lives in this country.

13:16.568 --> 13:18.518
- Some immigrants.
- Hey...

13:18.569 --> 13:20.929
This wasn't exactly my dream, either.

13:23.249 --> 13:24.519
What will Charlene do?

13:24.569 --> 13:27.519
She lives for this one
kind word from her father.

13:27.569 --> 13:29.569
And now she's never going to get it.

13:30.569 --> 13:34.249
I had my baby taken off
me. Did you know that?

13:35.089 --> 13:36.519
No. I'm...

13:36.569 --> 13:38.569
I'm sorry.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.520
I've let him down, haven't I?

13:42.570 --> 13:43.930
My dad.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.520
Do you know, I remember you.

13:47.570 --> 13:51.520
After school, always rushing
home to help on the farm.

13:51.570 --> 13:54.520
That's the life... My brothers' life now.

13:54.570 --> 13:57.520
I wasn't even in the running
to take over the farm.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.521
Still, my dad calls me every night

14:00.571 --> 14:03.201
and asks advice on this,
that, the tractor.

14:03.251 --> 14:05.091
Your dad asks you for advice?

14:06.571 --> 14:08.521
Yeah.

14:08.571 --> 14:09.571
Sometimes.

14:18.571 --> 14:21.522
Hey, honey, I'm going
to make the two of...

14:21.572 --> 14:23.522
three of us something to eat.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.092
OK. Hello, Lydia's son.

14:27.572 --> 14:30.522
I thought that, er, when Alex goes home,

14:30.572 --> 14:35.572
tonight might be a good night for
us to resume our Uno challenge...

14:37.572 --> 14:39.522
Mr Hixon, can I ask you something?

14:39.572 --> 14:41.573
Sure.

14:46.573 --> 14:49.523
How do you know when someone likes you?

14:49.573 --> 14:51.573
You know, like that.

14:53.573 --> 14:56.523
Well, a lot of times, you don't.

14:56.573 --> 14:58.523
You know, erm...

14:58.573 --> 15:01.364
I would just say you...

15:01.414 --> 15:04.574
go up to them and
you pour your heart out.

15:05.574 --> 15:07.524
Life is short.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.574
So, you...

15:10.574 --> 15:15.364
go up to him or her and
just really lay it on the line.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.524
You know, and the good news
is, if you crash and burn,

15:18.574 --> 15:21.094
you have a good friend
who can pick you back up.

15:22.415 --> 15:23.575
Yeah.

15:34.575 --> 15:36.525
- Hello?
- Bill.

15:36.575 --> 15:39.525
Any truth to the story that Darren
Bailey was so hated by his workers

15:39.575 --> 15:42.526
that they actually threw a party
when they found out he was dead?

15:42.576 --> 15:45.526
Are you really going to insinuate
that the foreign workers

15:45.576 --> 15:48.526
- rose up against him?
- I wasn't.

15:48.576 --> 15:51.526
- But I think you just did.
- Way to pour gasoline on the fire.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.526
I also read your article
about the gold-digger,

15:54.576 --> 15:57.526
- worming her way into Darren's millions.
- Lubica Varga.

15:57.576 --> 15:59.736
Yeah, she looks hot in those
bikini pictures, too, hey?

15:59.760 --> 16:00.886
Please...

16:00.936 --> 16:03.367
Well, someone whacked him over the head.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.567
Just telling a story.

16:05.617 --> 16:08.577
Don't you think that story's
been told enough round here?

16:13.577 --> 16:15.527
This is Darren Bailey, leave a message.

16:24.578 --> 16:28.528
So, your father actually
comes to you for advice?

16:28.578 --> 16:30.528
Yeah. We're close.

16:30.578 --> 16:33.528
We go bowling every Thursday.
Every night since I were a kid.

16:33.578 --> 16:36.528
- Goddamn.
- Take a listen to this, sir.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.528
So, Matthew weren't kidding when
he said everyone hated his dad.

16:41.578 --> 16:43.529
- What are they saying?
- I don't know.

16:43.579 --> 16:46.369
I don't speak Slovenian.
But you get the gist.

16:46.419 --> 16:49.529
There's loads of messages from all sorts.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.579
Six from some bloke called Tomas Kovac.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.529
I've sent Cobley and Drakes down to
root out the ones we can identify.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.529
- Like Kovac.
- What about the brothers Grimm?

16:58.579 --> 17:01.529
- They stand to inherit the place.
- Their alibis check out.

17:01.579 --> 17:03.529
They spent the night drinking in Boston.

17:03.579 --> 17:05.530
I mean, they don't want their dad gone.

17:05.579 --> 17:06.530
They don't want to work that hard.

17:06.579 --> 17:09.730
The place shows a turnover of 8 million.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.530
8 million?

17:12.579 --> 17:13.530
It's a goldmine.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.569
What if he isn't doing it on his own?

17:15.619 --> 17:18.530
You said Lubica had an economics degree.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.260
Maybe she's the brains.

17:29.101 --> 17:30.531
Tomas Kovac.

17:30.581 --> 17:33.531
Yeah, he looks like he could
follow through on a phone threat.

17:33.581 --> 17:36.051
He could have dumped Darren's
body in the suitcase.

17:36.101 --> 17:37.571
About that...

17:37.621 --> 17:40.731
They're looking for someone who
dumped a body up at Frith Bank.

17:40.781 --> 17:43.531
But we know it was further up, don't we?

17:43.581 --> 17:44.531
Do we?

17:44.581 --> 17:45.582
I don't.

17:47.582 --> 17:50.582
Watch my back, Drakesy. I'm going in.

17:58.582 --> 18:00.532
We'd like a word, please, Mr Kovac.

18:00.582 --> 18:01.532
In private, if that's all right.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.532
You can say what you like in
front of Lubica. She's a friend.

18:04.582 --> 18:07.533
Look, where were you last Tuesday night?

18:07.583 --> 18:09.533
Here. I'm here every day.

18:09.583 --> 18:11.263
Dimitri...

18:12.783 --> 18:15.733
You were here until the
gym closed, 10:00pm.

18:15.783 --> 18:19.373
We signed in. We have to.
It comes out of our wages.

18:19.423 --> 18:20.533
Everything does.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.733
I'm the best picker he had.
And I was negative wages.

18:23.783 --> 18:26.584
Paying to work, that's slavery, no?

18:27.584 --> 18:28.584
Right...

18:36.584 --> 18:37.584
Three.

18:43.584 --> 18:45.534
Do you think someone
killed Dad over money?

18:45.584 --> 18:48.535
Charlene, we're just covering
bases. The last three years will do.

18:48.585 --> 18:49.535
Anything that's not in archive.

18:49.585 --> 18:52.535
I'm not sure where the accounts are
kept. Lubica put a new system...

18:52.585 --> 18:54.575
That's them there.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.535
Here, look at the spreadsheets.

18:56.585 --> 18:58.535
This is a labyrinth.

18:58.585 --> 19:01.575
It'd take a forensic accountant six
months to go through this shit.

19:01.625 --> 19:05.535
Well, if it's that complex,
it's to hide something.

19:05.585 --> 19:06.735
Debts, laundering...

19:06.785 --> 19:09.536
Lubica is all over the accounts.

19:09.586 --> 19:11.586
Notes are in her handwriting.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.896
What happened here?

19:14.946 --> 19:17.586
Well, that's the most recent quarter, sir.

19:22.586 --> 19:23.586
Wait, what is it, sir?

19:25.586 --> 19:27.266
Sir...?

19:29.587 --> 19:31.587
Will you be back?

19:34.587 --> 19:36.537
Do you see what I mean?

19:36.587 --> 19:38.377
Something changed.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.737
Six months ago, those were
classic smoke-and-mirror accounts.

19:41.787 --> 19:43.537
Double transactions, switchbacks...

19:43.587 --> 19:46.537
Now it's like Mary
Poppins and Mother Teresa

19:46.587 --> 19:48.538
opened a retirement fund.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.948
- Clean as a whistle.
- I thought...

19:52.428 --> 19:53.828
you weren't talking to me.

19:55.588 --> 19:58.538
Well, you did prosecute
the serious fraud case

19:58.588 --> 20:02.378
- against the Liberian fund.
- Are we going to talk about what happened?

20:02.428 --> 20:04.948
We do not have to talk about what happened.
Andrew, my ex...

20:04.972 --> 20:07.538
Not everyone talks about everything
that happens all the time.

20:07.588 --> 20:10.589
Andrew and I are just friends. .

20:11.589 --> 20:13.539
- Occasionally, with benefits.
- There it is.

20:13.589 --> 20:14.739
But not of late.

20:14.789 --> 20:16.589
I put a stop to that.

20:17.629 --> 20:19.589
I felt it was...

20:20.589 --> 20:23.589
- holding me back.
- Holding you back from what?

20:27.589 --> 20:30.190
You should take it this
time. It is actually ringing.

20:35.090 --> 20:36.390
You're so romantic.

20:40.590 --> 20:44.220
So, the girl, Lubica. You think she
was running the old dirty accounts

20:44.270 --> 20:45.540
and the new clean ones?

20:45.590 --> 20:47.740
I think she was doing more than that.

20:47.790 --> 20:50.541
Skeltoft Farm Limited is no
longer the holding company.

20:50.591 --> 20:52.541
It's a shell under a new owner.

20:52.591 --> 20:54.541
Skeltoft Assets.

20:54.591 --> 20:57.111
Well, who owns the goddamn farm?

20:58.271 --> 21:00.541
So, Lubica owns the bloody place?

21:00.591 --> 21:02.591
She is the majority shareholder
in Skeltoft Assets.

21:02.641 --> 21:04.681
Which is the holding company
for the whole business.

21:04.705 --> 21:06.901
Muriel...
Not now, Sean. I'm talking to the Chief.

21:06.951 --> 21:09.541
So, what did Darren's kids
have to say about it all?

21:09.591 --> 21:11.222
No, I don't think they know.

21:11.272 --> 21:14.382
Otherwise, we would have heard
DJ screaming about it from here.

21:14.432 --> 21:15.542
Lubica... Wow!

21:15.592 --> 21:17.542
Muriel...

21:17.592 --> 21:19.542
I mean, it's such a classic move.

21:19.592 --> 21:21.752
Saddle a company with bad
debt, run it into the ground,

21:21.802 --> 21:24.792
- then they're forced to sign it over to you.
- And then you do them in.

21:24.842 --> 21:26.542
Poor Charlene.

21:26.592 --> 21:29.222
She trusted Lubica like a second mom.

21:29.272 --> 21:32.383
Mum? She's only three
years older than Charlene.

21:32.433 --> 21:33.543
She's an arctic fox.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.543
She'd chew off her own leg to survive.

21:35.593 --> 21:38.433
- So, you think Lubica did it all on her own?
- You don't think she did?

21:38.457 --> 21:40.063
You don't think she's smart enough?

21:40.113 --> 21:42.543
If you follow the money,
it's the only answer.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.543
Yeah, and you follow the suitcase
and you get an even better one.

21:45.593 --> 21:47.543
CCTV from Witham Bend.

21:47.593 --> 21:49.543
What am I looking at?

21:49.593 --> 21:54.634
Tomas Kovac in possession of a
Maklov 1000 Wednesday last, 7:13am.

21:56.094 --> 21:58.594
The same suitcase I found Darren in.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.545
'The suspect is Tomas Kovac.

22:11.595 --> 22:13.545
Heavy-set, hunky build.

22:13.595 --> 22:16.115
He should be approached with caution.

22:17.595 --> 22:19.545
They're still searching. Not a sign.

22:19.595 --> 22:22.545
- Do you want us to bring the dogs in?
- Is this his?

22:22.595 --> 22:24.435
- Yes.
- Right.

22:36.636 --> 22:39.226
He sent money to Slovenia.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.546
We all send money to our families.

22:41.596 --> 22:43.546
15 grand?

22:43.596 --> 22:45.546
He's done a runner, hasn't he?

22:45.596 --> 22:46.596
Yeah.

22:48.596 --> 22:50.572
Dad wouldn't give up this
company. He built it from nothing.

22:50.596 --> 22:52.917
- What was he thinking?
- Thinking with his dick, as usual.

22:52.941 --> 22:54.547
That's my dad that you're talking about.

22:54.597 --> 22:55.547
Well, three months ago,

22:55.597 --> 22:58.547
he folded the previous corporate
structure into a new entity.

22:58.597 --> 23:00.387
All assets controlled by Miss Varga.

23:00.437 --> 23:01.557
That was her plan all along.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.547
Get Dad, get in our house, get
the lot. I'm calling the lawyer.

23:04.597 --> 23:06.547
I wouldn't.

23:06.597 --> 23:09.237
You've hundreds of thousands from
this camp going through the books

23:09.261 --> 23:10.547
that are completely unexplained.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.547
I'm freezing your assets

23:12.597 --> 23:16.118
until the proceeds of crime investigation's complete.
- Serious?

23:17.638 --> 23:19.598
This is bullshit.

23:26.598 --> 23:28.598
- Does any of this makes sense to you?
- Does what?

23:28.622 --> 23:31.228
Dad was killed. Tomas went missing.

23:31.278 --> 23:32.548
Tomas killed Dad.

23:32.598 --> 23:34.549
Were you aware of any kind of relationship

23:34.599 --> 23:36.639
- between Miss Varga and Tomas?
- They were friends.

23:36.663 --> 23:38.549
He trained her. He trained me, too.

23:38.599 --> 23:40.959
- Are you trying to say...?
- Were they training that night?

23:40.983 --> 23:43.983
- Did you see them maybe?
- Lubica did all of the books. She...

23:45.799 --> 23:47.549
Charlene?

23:47.599 --> 23:49.599
I introduced her to Dad!

23:52.599 --> 23:55.600
Did I introduce Dad to
the woman that killed him?

24:10.280 --> 24:12.600
Darren asked me to do the accounts.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.551
It was a better job than
picking in frozen fields.

24:16.601 --> 24:19.601
You concealed financial crime.

24:20.601 --> 24:23.601
It was nothing to do with
me. Darren was the boss.

24:25.601 --> 24:28.551
He had many unsavoury
friends. Criminals, probably.

24:28.601 --> 24:32.391
Always out drinking, doing
cocaine, whatever he felt like.

24:32.441 --> 24:35.552
I told him financial crime
was for men smarter than him.

24:35.602 --> 24:38.232
He promised he'd stop.

24:38.282 --> 24:39.552
And he did.

24:39.602 --> 24:44.552
So, he closed the dirty company and
opened the new one in your name.

24:44.602 --> 24:46.552
Signing the assets into my name

24:46.602 --> 24:48.552
was to protect his family and their home.

24:48.602 --> 24:50.552
Why not sign it over to his children?

24:50.602 --> 24:52.602
Cos he didn't want them to
know the mess he'd made.

24:52.626 --> 24:54.552
Who was the bad money, Lubica?

24:54.602 --> 24:56.553
Who was he in bed with?

24:56.603 --> 24:59.603
There was much Darren kept from me.

25:00.603 --> 25:03.553
OK, do you really think I'd
be back picking cabbages

25:03.603 --> 25:06.553
in the fricking rain if I had
thousands stashed under my mattress?

25:06.603 --> 25:09.553
- What about Tomas Kovac?
- What about Tomas Kovac?

25:09.603 --> 25:11.553
Tomas dumped the body.

25:11.603 --> 25:14.553
Tomas sent £15,000 home to his family.

25:14.603 --> 25:16.554
A down payment for killing Darren, was it?

25:16.604 --> 25:18.394
Tomas didn't kill anyone.

25:18.444 --> 25:20.554
He cries when he finds a
dead dormouse in the field.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.604
Where is he, Lubica?

25:23.804 --> 25:25.604
Where's Tomas?

25:36.605 --> 25:38.555
Dad used to say that I was just like Mum.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.605
I only ever think of myself.

25:41.605 --> 25:45.605
Which is funny, really. Because I've
never thought that much of myself.

25:47.605 --> 25:50.395
Dads talk a lot of shit sometimes.
No.

25:50.445 --> 25:51.605
He was right.

25:53.125 --> 25:55.555
I've fucked up more than once.

25:55.605 --> 25:57.806
School, drink, drugs...

26:00.606 --> 26:04.606
Then there was this guy on the
farm who gave me some attention.

26:06.286 --> 26:08.446
When I told Dad that I was pregnant...

26:09.606 --> 26:11.606
Well, you can imagine how that one went.

26:15.606 --> 26:17.286
How did you feel?

26:20.607 --> 26:22.557
I wasn't good enough to be a mum.

26:22.607 --> 26:25.607
Well, yeah. I mean,
that's crazy. You were 14.

26:27.607 --> 26:28.607
He made me give her up.

26:28.647 --> 26:30.807
So, the baby was adopted.

26:32.127 --> 26:33.607
I couldn't look after myself.

26:34.607 --> 26:38.608
Dad said he was done with looking
after feckless women's babies.

26:39.608 --> 26:41.558
He was upset about your mother leaving.

26:41.608 --> 26:42.558
No.

26:42.608 --> 26:44.448
He was right.

26:45.608 --> 26:46.608
I'm not good enough.

26:47.608 --> 26:50.558
I needed to show him that
I could be his daughter.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.608
Be someone's mum.

26:54.608 --> 26:56.608
It's too late now.

27:01.609 --> 27:04.609
You're not going to do
anything stupid, right?

27:06.609 --> 27:07.609
No.

27:10.649 --> 27:13.129
I'm not brave enough for that.

27:46.611 --> 27:48.611
When you, erm...

27:50.611 --> 27:52.611
took those pills...

27:54.131 --> 27:55.651
how did it feel?

27:57.611 --> 27:59.561
I don't know.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.612
I think I felt relieved.

28:02.612 --> 28:04.612
And alone?

28:11.612 --> 28:13.612
I could have helped you.

28:14.612 --> 28:17.562
Were you afraid to come to me?
Did you think you'd let me down

28:17.612 --> 28:19.562
by sending that boy your photos?

28:19.612 --> 28:22.403
You down? I let Mom down.

28:22.453 --> 28:25.563
She never would have fallen
for a stupid trick like that.

28:25.613 --> 28:28.713
I wanted her to yell at me. And
she wasn't even around to do that.

28:30.589 --> 28:31.589
I'm sorry.

28:31.613 --> 28:33.613
Alex kissed me today.

28:35.613 --> 28:37.613
- What?
- He said it was your idea.

28:40.613 --> 28:43.614
- I thought Alex was gay.
- That's what I thought as well, Dad.

28:45.454 --> 28:47.564
Why does everyone always
want something more?

28:47.614 --> 28:49.614
Things were fine the way they were.

28:50.614 --> 28:53.614
I just want things to go
back to the way they were.

29:17.615 --> 29:19.565
I believe you wanted to speak to me.

29:19.615 --> 29:21.575
A night in the cell has
focused your mind, has it?

29:21.615 --> 29:25.616
Yes. You are a very clever policewoman.

29:28.816 --> 29:33.566
Darren has a safe where he
keeps his paperwork and stuff.

29:33.616 --> 29:35.716
Maybe in there you will
find what you need.

29:37.616 --> 29:39.616
I'll show you.

29:55.617 --> 29:57.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

29:57.457 --> 29:59.257
What the fuck does she
think she's doing here?

29:59.281 --> 30:01.567
- I thought she was locked up.
- Right, she's helping us.

30:01.617 --> 30:03.568
A lot more than I can say for you two.

30:03.618 --> 30:05.818
I know you paid someone
to find Tomas Kovac.

30:06.618 --> 30:09.568
Not to find him. To kill him.

30:09.618 --> 30:12.618
You're stupid enough
to say that to a copper?

30:27.619 --> 30:29.619
Behind that.

30:32.299 --> 30:34.619
He always loved me in that mirror.

30:41.619 --> 30:44.620
There's no financial stuff in
here. It's just old letters.

30:46.620 --> 30:48.410
They're written in Polish.

30:48.460 --> 30:50.620
More hate mail, probably.

30:51.620 --> 30:52.620
Jesus!

30:54.620 --> 30:57.620
Get her in that car. I
want her out of here now.

30:59.140 --> 31:01.610
You're dead! You are fucking dead!

31:01.660 --> 31:04.571
- Charlene, stop it, calm down.
- I'm going to kill her!

31:04.621 --> 31:07.571
- Calm down, Charlene.
- Fucking dead!

31:07.621 --> 31:08.571
Fucking kill her!

31:08.621 --> 31:11.621
Requesting assistance.
Critical incident at Skeltoft.

31:12.597 --> 31:13.597
Hey!

31:13.621 --> 31:15.621
Get down, now!

31:17.621 --> 31:19.571
Hey, hey! Stop.

31:19.621 --> 31:21.621
Stop it.

31:23.621 --> 31:25.572
I had to hide. They were going to kill me.

31:25.622 --> 31:27.302
Tomas Kovac...

31:28.662 --> 31:31.622
I'm arresting you for
the murder of Darren Bailey.

31:38.622 --> 31:39.932
You argued with Darren.

31:39.982 --> 31:43.572
We've got you on his voicemail
threatening to kill him.

31:43.622 --> 31:46.623
You're a man of your word.
You went through with it.

31:47.623 --> 31:50.573
Or maybe it wasn't your fault at all.

31:50.623 --> 31:52.573
Maybe it wasn't your idea.

31:52.623 --> 31:54.573
I have nothing to say to you.

31:54.623 --> 31:56.573
How much do you earn through the camp?

31:56.623 --> 31:57.773
Let's take last month.

31:57.823 --> 32:00.823
£643.49p in your back pocket.

32:02.623 --> 32:05.623
Yet, you sent home 15 grand.

32:06.624 --> 32:09.254
Lubica paid you to kill Darren.

32:09.304 --> 32:10.574
Didn't she?

32:10.624 --> 32:12.624
You think I take money from a woman?

32:13.624 --> 32:16.984
- Don't go down for her.
- I have nothing to say to you.

32:21.624 --> 32:22.824
Cobley!

32:29.625 --> 32:31.575
What was that?

32:31.625 --> 32:33.625
What did you say to him?

32:35.625 --> 32:38.935
We've got cameras all with
sound, so we're going to find out.

32:38.985 --> 32:41.145
I told him not to worry.

32:41.985 --> 32:44.575
Really? Because I'd be worried.

32:44.625 --> 32:47.096
- He did nothing.
- Nothing?

32:47.146 --> 32:50.576
He was caught on camera dumping
Darren Bailey's body. That's murder.

32:50.626 --> 32:52.256
Tomas didn't kill Darren.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.466
He just put him in the suitcase.

32:55.626 --> 32:57.626
How do you know that?

32:59.126 --> 33:00.666
Because I told him to.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.577
Are you sure you don't want
someone else to do this, sir?

33:18.627 --> 33:20.577
Nonsense, Muriel. This is your case.

33:20.627 --> 33:23.627
You've got this, Yeardsley. Make us proud.

33:31.628 --> 33:33.578
Lubica Varga...

33:33.628 --> 33:37.628
I presume you're here to confess
to the murder of Darren Bailey?

33:39.468 --> 33:40.578
No.

33:40.628 --> 33:41.578
No?

33:41.628 --> 33:42.778
No?

33:42.828 --> 33:44.938
I found him in our bedroom.

33:44.988 --> 33:46.628
Lying on the floor.

33:47.628 --> 33:49.579
His head broken.

33:49.629 --> 33:51.579
And you with a large,
blunt object in your hand.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.579
I did not kill him.

33:53.629 --> 33:55.579
You just found him.

33:55.629 --> 33:57.579
So, why didn't you call the police?

33:57.629 --> 33:59.579
You have to ask?

33:59.629 --> 34:01.579
His body in my bedroom.

34:01.629 --> 34:03.259
You wouldn't have believed me.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.579
For some reason, I thought
the authorities might do

34:05.629 --> 34:09.580
what they normally do, and blame the
Slovenian gold-digging immigrant.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.580
Isn't this what the newspaper called me?

34:11.630 --> 34:14.630
You told Tomas to do a runner.

34:15.630 --> 34:18.580
I told him to go to the
airport and never come back.

34:18.630 --> 34:20.580
Not to hide in the polytunnels.

34:20.630 --> 34:22.420
Did you pay him?

34:22.469 --> 34:24.580
No. I offered, actually. But he...

34:24.630 --> 34:27.580
- doesn't take money from women.
- Doesn't take money from women.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.580
Yeah, I've heard.

34:28.630 --> 34:32.581
So, he risked life imprisonment...

34:32.630 --> 34:33.781
for a friend?

34:33.831 --> 34:35.630
Yes.

34:36.630 --> 34:39.831
It is also true that, one day,
he'd like to be fucking me.

34:41.630 --> 34:43.630
I see...

34:44.630 --> 34:49.581
All-empowered Englishwoman looking
up to your male boss for direction.

34:49.630 --> 34:53.581
Yes. Yes, I asked him to help me.

34:53.632 --> 34:56.581
Because I was physically unable to
crack the bones of my dead lover,

34:56.632 --> 34:59.632
put him in the bag and then
remove it from my bedroom.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.672
Tomas did it for me because
he has passion for me.

35:05.632 --> 35:08.312
You've never felt this
sort of passion, have you?

35:09.632 --> 35:13.633
That feeling deep in your groin that
would make you do anything for her.

35:15.473 --> 35:18.633
Darren was a hard man to love. But I did.

35:20.633 --> 35:22.583
He was not afraid to get his hands dirty.

35:22.633 --> 35:26.633
You wouldn't find him watching
TV talent shows and moisturising.

35:28.633 --> 35:32.634
It's just pathetic this country with
its shit food and piss-water beer.

35:33.634 --> 35:37.634
Even the women, afraid to dress
nice, in case someone looks at them.

35:38.634 --> 35:41.584
Then complaining when they don't.

35:41.634 --> 35:43.584
Where did Tomas get the money?

35:43.634 --> 35:45.584
Come on, £15,000.

35:45.634 --> 35:48.584
You tell people like me
we're lazy, useless, go home.

35:48.634 --> 35:51.585
Well, maybe we will. See
how you deal with that.

35:51.635 --> 35:58.585
Tomas Kovac sent 15 grand
back home months ago.

35:58.635 --> 36:00.785
Yeah, you go, Muriel.

36:00.835 --> 36:02.585
Once you got Skeltoft under your name,

36:02.635 --> 36:05.585
you decided to have Darren
killed. You planned this.

36:05.635 --> 36:07.585
You paid him.

36:07.635 --> 36:08.785
I did not pay him.

36:08.835 --> 36:11.585
If that wasn't payment for
a murder, what was it for?

36:11.636 --> 36:13.636
Where did Tomas get the money, Lubica?

36:24.636 --> 36:26.836
We all got emails. Free money, it said.

36:28.476 --> 36:30.676
Some of us were stupid
enough to believe it.

36:31.636 --> 36:35.587
All we had to do was let
them use our bank details.

36:35.637 --> 36:37.587
They put thousands through our accounts

36:37.637 --> 36:39.587
and let us keep a few hundred each time.

36:39.637 --> 36:41.087
Layering.

36:41.637 --> 36:43.587
Layering?

36:43.637 --> 36:44.587
What's that, then?

36:44.637 --> 36:48.107
It's money laundered through
thousands of private accounts.

36:48.157 --> 36:51.267
So, the little guys get popped
and the big guys never do.

36:51.317 --> 36:53.588
Loads of people in the camp fell for it.

36:53.638 --> 36:57.588
There were new iPads. Canada
Goose coats everywhere.

36:57.638 --> 36:59.588
It wasn't just the
workers, though, was it?

36:59.638 --> 37:03.138
That's what you were trying to hide
in the Skeltoft business accounts.

37:03.638 --> 37:07.588
Darren was letting them use
the camp and all its workers

37:07.638 --> 37:09.478
to launder money.

37:11.638 --> 37:13.589
Like I said, I told him to stop.

37:13.639 --> 37:14.639
And when he did...?

37:16.639 --> 37:18.589
They didn't like it.

37:18.639 --> 37:20.589
Yeah, they killed him.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.639
Who are they, Lubica?

37:30.999 --> 37:33.589
She said he died at
Skeltoft in their bedroom.

37:33.640 --> 37:36.590
Someone hit him. And we
still don't have a weapon.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.590
Broadbent says there are no
traces of fragments in his skull.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.590
She's still waiting on
blood and tissue analysis.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.640
It makes sense. I mean, it's
only a murder investigation.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.160
The story checks out.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.590
There's evidence of layering in
a lot of the workers' accounts

37:53.640 --> 37:55.591
and your dad's books.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.681
Yeah, someone was using
this place to money launder.

37:57.705 --> 37:59.631
And they didn't like it
when he wanted to stop.

37:59.681 --> 38:01.481
So, the money men killed Dad?

38:02.641 --> 38:04.591
But you don't know who
they are yet, do you?

38:04.641 --> 38:06.481
You're useless.

38:11.841 --> 38:14.431
This is where she said she found him,

38:14.481 --> 38:16.272
on his back, his head to the door.

38:16.322 --> 38:18.222
So, they came in behind him and hit him.

38:19.642 --> 38:21.632
The wound was at the top of the skull.

38:21.682 --> 38:23.642
It was a hard, downward motion.

38:25.002 --> 38:28.592
Darren's what, six feet tall?
This ceiling's barely seven.

38:28.642 --> 38:31.042
I don't think they could
get that kind of an angle.

38:32.642 --> 38:35.593
Somebody killed Darren
Bailey. He was a piggy bank.

38:35.643 --> 38:38.943
They weren't going to let that go
just because he wanted to go legit.

38:41.163 --> 38:42.593
Here it is.

38:42.643 --> 38:46.643
Darren tested positive
for alcohol, cocaine...

38:47.643 --> 38:48.953
and cyanide?

38:49.003 --> 38:50.593
Cyanide?

38:50.643 --> 38:52.643
- He was poisoned?
- But the head wound...?

38:55.644 --> 38:57.594
So, he fell and hit his head.

38:57.644 --> 39:00.594
But the fall didn't kill
him. It was the poison.

39:00.644 --> 39:03.594
He must have hit something
hard on the way down.

39:03.644 --> 39:05.644
Get forensics in here. He was poisoned.

39:07.644 --> 39:09.594
Hi, Val.

39:09.644 --> 39:11.594
Go and get the brothers.

39:11.644 --> 39:13.604
Poison's intimate. It's
someone you're close with.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.644
Someone you're breaking bread with.

39:30.645 --> 39:33.595
You two are certainly
chips off the old block.

39:33.645 --> 39:36.596
It's not ours. Charl was here last.

39:36.646 --> 39:38.646
Charlene's doing cocaine again?

39:39.646 --> 39:43.046
She hasn't touched the stuff since
rehab. That's Dad's tin. His stash.

39:44.646 --> 39:46.596
Charlene used to score it for him.

39:46.646 --> 39:48.646
Charlene got coke for your dad?

39:49.646 --> 39:52.646
Yeah.
Where did Charlene get the coke?

39:53.646 --> 39:57.597
Dad was picky with what he liked.
Pure Siberian snow, he called it.

39:57.647 --> 39:58.847
Siberian snow?

40:01.647 --> 40:04.647
- Where is she?
- I don't know. But I saw her run off.

40:07.647 --> 40:09.597
- Dad's car's not there.
- Stupid cow.

40:09.647 --> 40:11.647
Why would she take the coke?

40:15.647 --> 40:17.327
Jesus Christ...!

40:20.648 --> 40:23.278
Charlene's been off
drugs for years. Why now?

40:23.328 --> 40:25.648
- She needed the courage, I guess.
- For what?

40:27.648 --> 40:29.948
Where are you going, sir?
She could be anywhere.

40:33.008 --> 40:36.118
She's going to Oleg Krasnov's.

40:36.168 --> 40:40.279
He's laundering money through the
camp. Charlene was the intermediary.

40:40.329 --> 40:42.649
I think she's going to try and kill him.

40:48.649 --> 40:50.799
She's just ahead, sir.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.649
She's nearly at Oleg's.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.330
Shit!

41:02.010 --> 41:04.600
- Charlene?
- Call for paramedics.

41:04.650 --> 41:06.440
Possible cocaine overdose.

41:06.490 --> 41:07.770
'Is she conscious and breathing?

41:07.794 --> 41:09.600
It's not cocaine, it's cyanide!

41:09.650 --> 41:10.600
Correction. It's cyanide.

41:10.650 --> 41:13.350
They poisoned your father's
coke. Is that what you took?

41:14.650 --> 41:17.640
He told me that I could
make Dad a tonne of money

41:17.690 --> 41:19.601
and that he'd be proud of me.

41:19.651 --> 41:20.601
Shh...

41:20.651 --> 41:23.601
Keep her talking, but
make sure she keeps warm.

41:23.651 --> 41:24.601
I didn't mean to.

41:24.651 --> 41:26.601
I killed him.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.651
Shh...

41:30.651 --> 41:32.651
I killed my dad!

41:36.691 --> 41:38.601
No, you didn't.

41:38.651 --> 41:41.052
The man who laced his
coke with cyanide did that.

42:02.173 --> 42:04.603
- Do you miss Queen Anne's?
- Not remotely.

42:04.653 --> 42:07.603
- It was a bitch fest.
- Thank God you made your escape.

42:07.653 --> 42:09.603
I ran away six times.

42:11.653 --> 42:13.653
You're already here. Sorry I'm late.

42:14.653 --> 42:17.653
How's, er...? How's everything?

42:18.629 --> 42:19.629
Good.

42:19.653 --> 42:22.644
It's given me a chance
to find out some things.

42:22.694 --> 42:25.604
Such as how you encouraged...

42:25.654 --> 42:28.964
Kelsey's gay boyfriend
to make a move on her.

42:30.654 --> 42:33.604
Well, that is a very rough synopsis.

42:33.654 --> 42:37.604
I knew Dad was involved when Alex
used the phrase "minimal risk".

42:38.854 --> 42:41.655
OK, we're going to need some wine.

43:02.656 --> 43:04.606
"Anna is 12 now."

43:04.656 --> 43:07.656
"She loves volleyball and Ariana Grande."

43:08.656 --> 43:11.656
"She's a happy girl and
loves her life here."

43:12.656 --> 43:15.656
"She would love to see her
mum, if her mum is interested."

43:16.656 --> 43:18.606
The letters were written in Polish.

43:18.656 --> 43:20.606
It took me a while to
work out what they were.

43:20.656 --> 43:22.657
Do you know he put her up for adoption?

43:23.657 --> 43:26.657
He wouldn't tell me where. He
just told me to sign the papers.

43:28.657 --> 43:30.657
I wanted to find her, but...

43:31.657 --> 43:34.607
Dad told me that they
didn't want to hear from me.

43:34.657 --> 43:36.607
They were in your dad's safe.

43:36.657 --> 43:38.657
He kept them all.

43:40.657 --> 43:43.608
Can you read it to me
again, please? The last one.

43:43.658 --> 43:45.178
Yeah. Erm...

43:47.658 --> 43:51.608
"Dear Anna's mum, we hope
you are getting our letters."

43:51.658 --> 43:55.608
"Anna is growing up so fast and she
often asks about her birth mother."

43:55.658 --> 43:58.608
"We tell her we are sure
you also think of her."

43:58.658 --> 44:02.658
"One day, we hope you
will both be able to meet."

44:07.659 --> 44:09.019
Thank you.

44:12.859 --> 44:15.289
What about him, the Russian?

44:15.339 --> 44:17.609
Do you have enough to arrest him?
No.

44:17.659 --> 44:20.609
He kept to himself, removed
from all those details.

44:20.659 --> 44:23.610
But trust me, I'm not letting go of this.

44:23.660 --> 44:25.970
I've got a lot to answer for, haven't I?

44:26.020 --> 44:28.820
- It's like Dad said, I...
- No, I'm sorry, but your dad was wrong.

44:31.660 --> 44:34.660
And you have a daughter out
there that needs you to see that.

44:53.661 --> 44:55.021
Are you staying?

44:56.181 --> 44:58.611
DJ and I came to an arrangement..

44:58.661 --> 45:01.661
They need someone who knows
how to run this place.

45:03.501 --> 45:05.612
I see someone's fixed the dryers.

45:05.662 --> 45:07.612
Someone took out the coin slots.

45:07.662 --> 45:08.812
It's good business.

45:08.862 --> 45:10.652
Incentivised workers work harder.

45:10.702 --> 45:12.612
I also fixed the hot tub.

45:12.662 --> 45:15.612
What about Tomas? Is he staying?

45:15.662 --> 45:19.612
He has big arms. And I
like men with big arms.

45:19.662 --> 45:21.662
Another marriage of convenience.

45:22.662 --> 45:24.662
Well, then, everybody's happy.

45:25.663 --> 45:26.813
Yeah.

45:26.863 --> 45:29.663
Including the man who
murdered Darren Bailey.

45:44.663 --> 45:46.064
I wasn't expecting you, Bill.

45:55.704 --> 45:59.614
Sorry about that. Next time,
my aim will be better.
