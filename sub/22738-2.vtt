around,

22:02.121 --> 22:03.923
but I'd come
this far.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.525
So,
I-I...

22:42.729 --> 22:44.897
that was his sense
of humor.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.867
he liked to
play dumb

22:47.900 --> 22:50.970
and, uh, and
tease me.

22:51.003 --> 22:55.775

"Yes. I think you can
help me."

23:01.113 --> 23:04.817
And I
smiled.

23:04.851 --> 23:08.154
And-and he didn't
smile back.

23:08.187 --> 23:13.125
and-and then he
