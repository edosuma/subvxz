Howdilly-hey, Camper Bart!
Ready for today's meeting?

12:12.398 --> 12:14.859
-You know-dilly know it, Neddy.
-Okilly-dokilly.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.945
Now, our annual father-son
rafting trip is next weekend.

12:18.028 --> 12:21.365
<i>(thinking) Oh, no.</i>
<i>Me bring Homer on a rafting trip?</i>

12:21.449 --> 12:26.412
Duh, I'm the captain.
My son is Bart.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.581
-What an oaf.
-How embarrassing.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.416
I'm glad he's not my father.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.209
(shudders)

12:32.293 --> 12:34.420
(sniffling)

12:34.503 --> 12:37.423
Oh, Warren, I know your dad
is in prison, but don't you fret.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.426
A special celebrity dad
has been arranged for ya.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.595
But my older brother
would like--

12:42.678 --> 12:46.182
Sorry, but I'm afraid Ernest Borgnine
has already been confirmed.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.434
(laughing)
Hiya!

12:48.517 --> 12:50.603
I'm sure you kids
know me best...

12:50.686 --> 12:53.606
as Sergeant Fatso Judson
in <i>From Here to Eternity.</i>

12:53.689 --> 12:55.316
(cheering)

12:57.568 --> 12:59.528
How was jerk practice, boy?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.781
Did they teach you
how to sing to trees...

13:01.864 --> 13:05.409
and build crappy furniture
out of useless wooden logs?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.578
Huh? D'oh!

13:07.661 --> 13:10.664
(growls)
Stupid poetic justice!

13:10.748 --> 13:13.793
Actually, we were just planning
the father-son river-rafting trip.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.836
Heh-heh!
You don't have a son.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.380
Look. Homer won't wanna go.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.382
So just ask him,
and he'll say no.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.384
Then it'll be his fault.

13:22.468 --> 13:26.055
I don't wanna go. So if he asks
me to go, I'll just say yes.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.641
<i>(thinking) Wait! Are you sure</i>
<i>that's how this sort of thing works?</i>

13:28.724 --> 13:30.935
Shut up, brain,
or I'll stab you with a Q-tip.

13:34.688 --> 13:38.067
Dad, I really want you to
come on this trip with me.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.486
Bart, I'd be delighted to
go on your trip with you.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.363
BOTH:
D'oh!

13:42.446 --> 13:45.533
-(crying)
-Aw, come on, kid. Quit cryin'.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.993
It'll be fun.
I promise.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.329
(laughing)

13:55.417 --> 13:58.462
Arr! Here be a fine vessel,

13:58.546 --> 14:01.382
the yarest river-goin'
boat there be.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.134
I'll take it.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.304
Arr. I don't know
what I'm doin'.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.932
Okeydokey.
Everybody find a partner.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.725
Two dads to a raft.

14:11.809 --> 14:16.230
(all chattering)

14:16.313 --> 14:19.608
Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders.
Please not Flanders.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.777
Well, Homer, looks like
we're boat buddies, huh?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.154
Want me to zinc your sniffer?

14:24.238 --> 14:26.949
(campers chattering, yelling)

14:30.703 --> 14:32.371
(gasps)
I guess now we know why...

14:32.454 --> 14:35.416
they call 'em rapids
and not "slowpids, huh?"

14:35.499 --> 14:38.711
-(laughing)
-You are not my son.

14:38.794 --> 14:43.173
Eh. Now, what happened to that
gosh-darn map I brought?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.801
-(wind gusts)
-(yelps) Um, I don't know.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.680
But lucky for you,
somebody here is responsible.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.932
Hey! There's a new Mexico.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.769
Whoa, Nelly!

14:55.853 --> 14:58.022
Oh! Quick, Homer!
Which way do we turn?

14:58.105 --> 15:00.649
So many Krusty Burger
locations.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.610
(drooling)

15:02.693 --> 15:06.780
Uh-oh! No time.
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John!

15:06.864 --> 15:11.285
-(grunting)
-(all screaming)

15:11.368 --> 15:14.246
Hey, where are the sissy
and the bald guy goin', huh?

15:14.330 --> 15:17.541
(all yelling)

15:20.920 --> 15:23.589
-(horn blows)
-Paddle harder, Homer.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.634
-We gotta fight the current.
-Wrong again, Flanders.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.886
In a situation like this,
you just relax

15:28.969 --> 15:31.639
and let the current
take you back to land.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.397
(whimpering)
D'oh.

Hey! I got that
for my birthday.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.674
Now I have to face
stupid reality again.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.509
Flanders!
My socks feel dirty.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.427
-Give me some water to wash 'em.
-Again?

16:10.511 --> 16:14.098
Homer, we have to ration
the water carefully. It's our only hope.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.934
Oh, pardon me,
Mr. Let's Ration Everything.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.477
What do you think
we're floatin' on?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.396
Don't you know the poem?

16:20.479 --> 16:24.024
"Water, water everywhere,
so let's all have a drink."

16:24.108 --> 16:28.070
-ALL: Homer! No!
-What does it matter?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.655
We're doomed.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.657

16:31.740 --> 16:35.244
We're saved!
Seagulls always stay near land.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.246
They only go out to sea
to die.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.039

16:39.123 --> 16:41.250
Whoo-hoo!
See that, boy?

16:41.333 --> 16:44.294
Your old man was right,
not Flanders.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.756
We are doomed.
In your face, Flanders!

16:47.840 --> 16:50.551
Well, at least Ned is trying.
What are you doing to help?

16:50.634 --> 16:53.554
Well, since you're all such
a big bunch of big ration babies,

16:53.637 --> 16:55.681
I'll just be in charge
of the rationing.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.141
Look here, boy.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.144
The secret is to take
tiny bites, like so.

17:00.227 --> 17:03.647
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

17:06.984 --> 17:08.610
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.863

-HOMER: Let go of my hand!

17:10.946 --> 17:13.282
D'oh!
(grunts)

17:13.365 --> 17:15.159
(bawling)

17:15.242 --> 17:17.536
Why couldn't I be
on one of the smart rafts?

17:17.619 --> 17:19.705
I bet they're having
the time of their lives.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.967
I keep telling you, lady.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.511
Your husband and son have
to be missing for a week...

17:34.595 --> 17:36.055
before we can start searching.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.723
I'd like to help sooner.
I would,

17:37.806 --> 17:40.309
but we're very,
very busy down here.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.603
Heesh!
King me.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.605

Still no help.

You know,
it is cougar season,

18:00.954 --> 18:02.289
This is the real thing.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.295
D'oh! All right.
Well, that's okay.

Thank you, Homer.
I don't know what got--

-(Ned grunting)
-Dad! I think he's okay.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.171

-It's better...

18:51.255 --> 18:54.716

-Sorry.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.762
-You see anything yet?
-Nothin', Captain.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.181
Somebody took all the beer
and cold cuts.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.309
That's it. I'm not even castin' off
until we go to the store.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.731
You know, Homer,
this cheese doodle

19:09.815 --> 19:12.151
is our last morsel of food.

19:12.234 --> 19:17.489
You'll thank me when we're
fryin' up a big, juicy fish.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.326

-Godspeed, little doodle.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.164
He'll be back.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.877
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.129
We're waiting.

19:35.507 --> 19:39.178
Son, there's something I was gonna
give you at the end of this trip,

19:39.261 --> 19:42.598
but, since we
may not survive,

19:42.681 --> 19:44.600
I want you to have it now.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.562
(gasps)
A real Swiss Army knife. Cool!

19:48.645 --> 19:51.356

Don't worry, kids. I'll take care
of him with my trusty--

Uh, uh--

20:00.199 --> 20:04.953
Um, uh-- Hmm.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.080
Dad, I know I've been
a little hard on you

20:07.164 --> 20:09.166
the last couple of days.

20:09.249 --> 20:13.045
If I had the strength to lift my arms,
I'd give you a hug.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.047
Thanks, boy.

(sizzling)

20:25.682 --> 20:27.684
Dad, don't take this wrong,

20:27.768 --> 20:30.229
but your expression doesn't
fill me with confidence.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.981
The foul stench of death
is upon us!

20:33.065 --> 20:35.984

Mmm! Hamburger.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.196
(sniffs) Hey, wait!
I smell hamburgers, too.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.156
(sniffing)

20:41.240 --> 20:43.158
According to this map,

20:43.242 --> 20:46.286
there's a Krusty Burger
on an off-shore oil rig.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.622
That's what you're
smelling, Homer.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.500
Oh, if it weren't for this
blasted fog, we'd be saved.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.169
Never mind the fog!

these are unmanned oil rigs.
