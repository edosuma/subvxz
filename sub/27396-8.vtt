16:55.333 --> 16:57.041
about joining the Union?

16:57.125 --> 17:01.125
The entirety of the emissary's
data is still being analyzed.

17:01.208 --> 17:02.250
We permitted you to come here

17:02.333 --> 17:04.583
so that we could
evaluate you directly.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.125
We have many
unresolved questions.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.667
Well, we're happy to answer
any of them we can.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.417
Isaac, we missed you
on the bridge.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.000
You ready to get back to work?

17:14.083 --> 17:16.166
I will not be returning
to the<i> Orville. </i>

17:16.250 --> 17:19.583
Wait, what?

17:19.667 --> 17:22.709
My time on your vessel has been
instructive and memorable,

17:22.792 --> 17:24.291
but my mission is complete.

17:24.375 --> 17:28.041
This is my homeworld.
It is where I belong.

17:28.125 --> 17:32.417
Isaac, you've made a home for
yourself on the<i> Orville, </i>too.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.083
Are you saying you're
just gonna walk away

17:35.166 --> 17:37.125
from everyone you know?

17:37.208 --> 17:39.166
From me?

17:39.250 --> 17:42.291
I was always cognizant
that my assignment would end.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.291
Look, why don't you take
some time, Isaac, think it over.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.250
We'll keep your chair warm
just in case you...

17:47.333 --> 17:49.375
The unit has answered
your inquiry.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.417
Yeah.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.083
I guess he has.

17:54.166 --> 17:57.500
Were you at least planning
to say goodbye to Ty and Marcus?

17:57.583 --> 17:59.125
For what purpose?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.166
Because they love you.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.542
You were there to observe.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.166
Didn't you observe that?

18:08.375 --> 18:10.500
Why don't you just come back
for a few minutes

18:10.583 --> 18:12.917
and pretend like you care?

18:36.417 --> 18:38.375
(door whooshes open)

18:40.208 --> 18:41.709
BOTH:
Isaac!

18:43.000 --> 18:44.166
I knew you'd be okay.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.250
We thought you were dead.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.125
I was merely deactivated.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.333
What's the difference?

18:48.417 --> 18:51.333
On Kaylon, when a unit
has fulfilled its purpose,

18:51.417 --> 18:52.917
it is shut down.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
But you're awake now.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.417
Your mother and Captain Mercer

18:56.500 --> 18:59.208
convinced Kaylon Primary
to reactivate me.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.208
Can you play games
with us again tonight?

19:01.291 --> 19:02.917
That will not be possible.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.750
I am here to inform you
that I am leaving the<i> Orville. </i>

19:05.834 --> 19:08.750
You're... leaving?

19:08.834 --> 19:09.750
Correct.

19:09.834 --> 19:10.750
For how long?

19:10.834 --> 19:12.208
I will not return.

19:12.291 --> 19:16.083
But... you were gonna be
our new dad.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.625
Our interactions
have allowed me to collect

19:19.709 --> 19:21.959
a great deal of behavioral data.

19:22.041 --> 19:25.625
Thank you for the opportunity to
observe your sibling dynamics.

19:25.709 --> 19:27.333
Mom?

19:27.417 --> 19:29.291
You heard him, Ty.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.458
His assignment is over.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.333
He's home now,
and he wants to stay.

19:32.417 --> 19:35.166
-Then I want to stay, too.
-No, Ty.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.959
I don't want you to go.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.458
The captain
and Commander Grayson

19:38.542 --> 19:41.291
are talking to the
Kaylon leaders right now.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.417
There's a good chance
they'll join the Union,

19:43.500 --> 19:44.667
and if that happens,

19:44.750 --> 19:46.542
you guys can stay in touch.

19:46.625 --> 19:49.959
Maybe we can come back
for a visit.

19:50.041 --> 19:53.834
But what if they
don't join the Union?

19:57.917 --> 20:00.875
Remember to consume
your daily required nutrients

20:00.959 --> 20:02.834
and obey your mother's commands.

20:02.917 --> 20:05.750
I fully expect that you will
both mature into competent

20:05.834 --> 20:07.583
and productive adults.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.625
-(door whooshes open)
-Isaac!

20:12.500 --> 20:14.458
(door whooshes shut)

20:20.458 --> 20:24.458
It is clear that the Union would
benefit from our participation.

20:24.542 --> 20:27.875
However, we see no advantage
for our world.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.250
Well, how can you be so sure?

20:29.333 --> 20:31.709
There are billions of planets
in our galaxy,

20:31.792 --> 20:33.667
and we've barely charted
a fraction of them.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.375
If you join the Union, you will
be part of a growing alliance

20:36.458 --> 20:40.417
of space-faring societies
dedicated to exploration.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.458
There's no telling
what you'll find out there.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.792
All that we require
is on Kaylon.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.041
And we have identified
various risks

20:47.125 --> 20:49.250
through our analysis
of Isaac's data.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.500
On your planet alone,
billions have been killed

20:52.583 --> 20:55.333
as a consequence
of war, slavery,

20:55.417 --> 20:57.333
genocide and persecution.

20:57.417 --> 21:00.041
Greed, individualism,
and competition

21:00.125 --> 21:02.834
have been the governing
principles of your society.

21:02.917 --> 21:05.166
If human history
is any indication,

21:05.250 --> 21:06.709
we would be foolish
to ally ourselves

21:06.792 --> 21:10.083
with such erratic
and destructive creatures.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.291
I know we don't have
the cleanest track record,

21:12.375 --> 21:14.458
but you're talking
about ancient history.

21:14.542 --> 21:18.041
You oscillate between periods
of enlightenment and tyranny.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.458
Can you prove this cycle
has been broken?

21:20.542 --> 21:23.667
Well, the Union itself
is all the proof you need.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.250
We are over 300 planetary
governments working together

21:27.333 --> 21:30.959
to ensure that no single world
imposes its will upon another.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.875
We treat each other as equals.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.375
And was the Kaylon emissary
treated as an equal

21:35.458 --> 21:36.709
aboard your ship?

21:36.792 --> 21:38.500
Isaac? Of course.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.875
Then perhaps
you can explain the abuse

21:40.959 --> 21:42.333
inflicted by your crew.

21:42.417 --> 21:43.417
Abuse?

21:43.500 --> 21:44.750
According to his reports,

21:44.834 --> 21:47.750
Isaac was repeatedly
demeaned and degraded.

21:47.834 --> 21:51.083
In one case, his cranial shell
was disfigured

21:51.166 --> 21:52.417
by prosthetic appendages.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.083
"Mr. Potato Head."

21:54.166 --> 21:57.542
He told you about that, huh?

21:57.625 --> 22:00.000
Was this humiliation meant
for your amusement?

22:00.083 --> 22:02.417
No. No, it's...
I mean, it was funny,

22:02.500 --> 22:05.500
but, you know, no one
was trying to hurt anybody.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.333
Isaac wanted to learn
about humor.

22:07.417 --> 22:10.166
Our helmsman was only trying
to help him understand.

22:10.250 --> 22:12.542
And, you know, then Isaac
cut the guy's leg off,

22:12.625 --> 22:15.375
so mistakes on all sides,
I think.

22:15.458 --> 22:19.458
Captain Mercer, we only seek
to understand your principles.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.208
We must be cautious.

22:21.291 --> 22:22.834
Opening our world to the outside

22:22.917 --> 22:25.125
would have far-reaching
implications.

22:25.208 --> 22:26.417
I understand that.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.125
But I hope
that you will understand

22:28.208 --> 22:31.500
that despite our...
cognitive defects,

22:31.583 --> 22:33.625
our worlds will be
stronger together.

22:33.709 --> 22:35.750
We will consider your offer.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.375
Did that go well?

22:39.458 --> 22:40.625
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

22:40.709 --> 22:42.417
I can't believe they knew
about Mr. Potato Head.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.875
Yeah, we are gonna get fired.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.417
Lieutenant, where are we going?

22:49.500 --> 22:52.583
You can't just walk off the ship
without following procedure.

22:52.667 --> 22:56.000
I have formally resigned
my provisionary commission.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.625
-What more is there to do?
-Discharge protocol.

22:58.709 --> 23:01.375
I am familiar
with Union regulations.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.208
There is no such protocol.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.583
-I don't know, but I threw up.
-I threw up, too.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.291
-You did?
-Yeah.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.000
Should've called me.
We could've thrown up together.

28:36.083 --> 28:37.917

28:38.000 --> 28:39.125
<i>BORTUS:</i>
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

28:39.208 --> 28:41.500
Mercer here, go ahead.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.333
<i>We have been analyzing the data</i>

28:43.417 --> 28:44.959
<i>from our scans</i>
<i>of the planet's surface</i>

28:45.041 --> 28:47.959
<i>and we have detected a large</i>
<i>array of spherical objects</i>

28:48.041 --> 28:49.792
<i>in the southern hemisphere.</i>

28:49.875 --> 28:53.000
<i>They are unlike anything else</i>
<i>we have seen on Kaylon.</i>

28:54.792 --> 28:57.583
Whatever they are, they're big
and there's a lot of them.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.125
With more cropping up
every hour.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.834
What do you make of it?

29:00.917 --> 29:02.917
Our scans cannot penetrate
the objects,

29:03.000 --> 29:04.875
but they appear to be generating
massive levels

29:04.959 --> 29:06.542
of theta-radiation.

29:06.625 --> 29:07.792
You normally see levels
like this

29:07.875 --> 29:09.417
in large-scale particle weapons.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.917
It might just be part of their
planetary defense system.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.834
Then why are they making
more of them?

29:13.917 --> 29:16.000
Keep scanning but be discreet.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.041
If they knew
we were snooping around,

29:18.125 --> 29:20.041
-it might not sit too well.
-And just keep in mind,

29:20.125 --> 29:22.542
we're still trying to convince
them to join the Union.

29:22.625 --> 29:24.166
Aye, sir.

29:45.875 --> 29:47.959
Ty.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.000
I know you're up there.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.041
You're gonna be late for school.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.458
Hey, little man.

30:21.542 --> 30:24.125
I found this in the corridor.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.583
Oh, sweetie.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.667
Why'd he throw it away?

30:29.750 --> 30:31.375
I thought he liked us.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.709
He does like you.

30:33.792 --> 30:34.959
In his way.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.750
But...

30:36.834 --> 30:40.000
Isaac doesn't have feelings
like biological people do.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.875
Yes, he does.

30:41.959 --> 30:45.458
Ty... he's a machine.

30:46.959 --> 30:49.875
Then why did he
play games with us?

30:49.959 --> 30:51.625
And tell stories?

30:51.709 --> 30:54.083
And come to dinner when
he doesn't even have to eat?

30:54.166 --> 30:57.041
Honey...

30:57.125 --> 30:59.542
Isaac was sent here to do a job,

30:59.625 --> 31:02.625
and now that job is over,
so he's going home.

31:02.709 --> 31:06.959
Just like our home is on Earth,
this is his home.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.834
Maybe he dropped it by accident.

31:10.917 --> 31:14.709
Ty, I know you can't understand
this at the moment, but...

31:14.792 --> 31:16.750
You're the one
who doesn't understand.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.291

You can stay in the simulator
a little while longer,

to go to school, okay?

by a biological species

40:50.959 --> 40:52.875
that once dominated this planet.

40:52.959 --> 40:55.625
An irresolvable conflict
occurred between us,

40:55.709 --> 40:57.834
and it became necessary
