<i>Tradition at the Crab Shack was...</i>

00:04.604 --> 00:08.301
<i>if you passed out the week before Christmas,</i>
<i>you got decorated.</i>

00:08.408 --> 00:12.777
<i>I wanted tojoin in, but there were certain times</i>
<i>when I needed to be lookin'after Randy-</i>

00:12.879 --> 00:14.972
- <i>like when he was readin'the comics.</i>
- [Laughing]

00:15.081 --> 00:17.345
Oh, God. That's terrible.

- [Laughing]
- <i>## [Jukebox: Country Christmas]</i>

00:19.953 --> 00:21.853
That's not funny at all.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.014
Randy, remember,
comics are only on the left.

00:24.124 --> 00:27.184
If you keep readin', you'll run
onto the side with the obituaries.

00:27.293 --> 00:29.784
- So what do we do?
- Fold the paper.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.796
Thanks, Earl.

00:31.898 --> 00:33.798

00:37.303 --> 00:40.431
<i>People, what have I told you?</i>
<i>If you're going to decorate the drunks...</i>

00:40.540 --> 00:43.634
<i>please have a fire extinguisher</i>
<i>standing by.</i>

00:45.078 --> 00:47.638
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:56.452
Uh, excuse me.
My wife and I were just driving home...

00:56.556 --> 00:59.992
from building Nerf playgrounds
for autistic children, and, uh, we ran out of gas.

01:00.093 --> 01:02.084
She would've come with me,
but she's shy...

01:02.195 --> 01:04.254
because we had to sell her hair
for baby formula.

01:04.364 --> 01:07.094
If you'd loan me a 20,
I'll, uh, mail it back to you.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.169
Goodness me.
That is such a sad story.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.465
And there were so many details,
it has to be true.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.972
Would you mind sharing it
with my friends inside?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.805
I'm sure they'd love to help.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.379
[All Laughing]

01:21.915 --> 01:25.146
And then he said he had a bald wife
who sold her hair for-

01:25.251 --> 01:27.219
What was it she sold it for?

01:27.320 --> 01:29.311
Baby formula.

01:29.422 --> 01:32.858
[Laughing]

01:32.959 --> 01:35.587
[Laughing]
What an idiot.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.163
The baby formula is "man plus woman."

01:38.264 --> 01:40.960
Everybody knows that.

01:41.067 --> 01:44.525
<i>[Earl Narrating] That hustler comin'in here</i>
<i>reminded me of number 201 on my list-</i>

01:44.637 --> 01:47.037
<i>conned an old man</i>
<i>out of a hundred bucks.</i>

01:47.140 --> 01:51.338
<i>A couple weeks before I discovered karma,</i>
<i>me and Joy were watching TV.</i>

01:51.444 --> 01:53.435
[Male Announcer]
There are one million orphans in Africa.

01:53.546 --> 01:56.947
These children do not ask,
"What shall I eat for dinner?"

01:57.050 --> 01:59.541
<i>They ask, "Will I ever eat again?"</i>

01:59.652 --> 02:02.712
Change the channel.
I can't eat while I'm lookin' at that kid.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.790
I'll try, but my hands are saucy.

02:04.891 --> 02:08.952
<i>For pennies a day, you can make sure</i>
<i>little Kwame has rice and broth to eat...</i>

02:09.062 --> 02:12.122
instead of bowl after bowl of mud.

02:12.232 --> 02:16.100
Those kids really pull
at your heartstrings.

02:16.202 --> 02:19.296
- Makes you think, doesn't it?
- [Sucks Teeth] Yep.

02:19.405 --> 02:22.670
We can make a fortune
off those scrawny little tearjerkers.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.869
- [Laughing]
- You got rib meat in your teeth.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.504
Well, get it.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.140
Man, that's really in there.

02:38.124 --> 02:42.857
Is this true?
Nine out of 10 African children die every minute?

02:42.962 --> 02:44.987
Africa's hard on kids...

02:45.098 --> 02:47.965
what with the hot sun
and giant leeches...

02:48.067 --> 02:51.002
and no... speed limits.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.902
- <i>Suppose you want some cash.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.907
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>The first rule of scammin'money out of people...</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:57.909
<i>is to look like</i>
<i>you</i> aren't <i>lookin'for money.</i>

02:58.011 --> 02:59.911
We're not askin' for money.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.277
But if you have trouble
sleepin' tonight...

03:02.382 --> 03:04.782
you can just send a check
to the address on the back.

03:04.884 --> 03:08.513
<i>The second rule of scammin'</i>
<i>was not to tell Randy it was a scam.</i>

03:08.621 --> 03:11.715
<i>'Cause there's no better salesman than</i>
<i>someone who believes he's tellin'the truth.</i>

03:11.824 --> 03:13.724
All they're eatin' is air.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.794
And the orphans' bellies
are really big...

03:15.895 --> 03:17.795
but it turns out
they're totally empty.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.923
And all they're askin' for
is a cup of coffee a day.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.025
Oh, my God!
Nine more just died.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.661
Open your eyes, people.
Take a pamphlet.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.865
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>We handed out a hundred pamphlets...</i>

03:27.974 --> 03:29.874
<i>and even went down</i>
<i>and got a "po"box...</i>

03:29.976 --> 03:31.967
<i>so the address</i>
<i>would look more official.</i>

03:32.078 --> 03:35.514
<i>Most people saw through our scam,</i>
<i>but we did get one bite.</i>

03:35.615 --> 03:37.981
Ka-ching! It worked!

03:38.084 --> 03:41.451
Some guy in Nathanville sent us
a hundred-dollar check for the orphans.

03:41.554 --> 03:46.082
- Sweet.
- Why are <i>you</i> gettin' the money
for the African orphans?

03:49.095 --> 03:51.563
Randy, maybe it's time to tell you.

03:51.664 --> 03:54.189
This was a scam.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.291
It was?

03:56.402 --> 03:58.302
You always get me.

03:58.404 --> 04:01.134
[Laughing]
Oh, man. I cried so much.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.971
<i>I didn't even tell you about</i>
<i>the nightmares I've been havin'.</i>

04:04.077 --> 04:06.637
Whew. Wow.
What a relief.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.078
So there's no starvin' children
in Africa then?

04:11.651 --> 04:13.016
No.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.553
<i>[Earl Narrating] And so me and Randy</i>
<i>went to find the guy...</i>

04:15.655 --> 04:18.021
<i>who'd sent us that check</i>
<i>all those years ago.</i>

04:21.861 --> 04:24.887
Did you know Aunt Ramona
wrote a book about barbecue sauces?

04:24.998 --> 04:26.898
Mom says it bought her a condo.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.198
I think I'm gonna write a book about
barbecue sauces. Maybe other sauces too.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.329
Randy, you don't know
anything about sauce.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.464
People write books
about things they know.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.873
Think about how much meat
Aunt Ramona eats.

04:37.977 --> 04:41.071
Maybe I could write a book
about how things taste-

04:41.180 --> 04:43.205
- you know, nonfood things.
- [Doorbell Rings]

04:43.316 --> 04:45.284
I have a curious tongue.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.616
- That could be the name of the book.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

04:48.721 --> 04:51.053
- Mr. Hill?
- Yes?

04:51.157 --> 04:53.682
I don't know if you remember,
but three years ago...

04:53.793 --> 04:56.853
you sent me a hundred dollars
to help save an orphan kid in Africa.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.796
Of course. Mbungo.

04:59.899 --> 05:03.630
[Chuckling]
That little fella. Why, he's changed my life.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.328
'Scuse me?

05:05.438 --> 05:08.566
- <i>## ["Here Comes Santa Claus"]</i>
- Here are some drawings Mbungo made me.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.575
All his letters...

05:10.677 --> 05:13.612
and his report cards
from the village school.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.613
Teacher comments:

05:15.715 --> 05:18.878
"Plays well with zebras.
Expert stick-thrower."

05:18.985 --> 05:21.545
You can tell he's special.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.988
- So you been sendin' checks this whole time?
- A hundred dollars a month.

05:26.092 --> 05:30.392
But it's worth it.
Take a look at this kid.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.364
<i>Knowin'that I make a difference</i>
<i>in Mbungo's life...</i>

05:34.467 --> 05:36.435
it makes me feel-

05:38.604 --> 05:41.232
- Joy.
- Exactly.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.434
- Joy.
- <i>[Randy] Ow!</i>

05:43.543 --> 05:45.875
Oh!

05:47.814 --> 05:51.841
Cactus: Painful, but worth it.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.981
Come on, Darnell.
Let me lick your head.

05:59.092 --> 06:03.188
It'll be in my new book-
right after "all ofJoy and Darnell's spoons."

06:03.296 --> 06:05.594
I guess,
if it's for research purposes.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.098
You been scammin' that poor man
for three years?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.101
I can't believe you're not
ashamed of yourself.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.036
If I had only fooled him once,
it'd be shame on me.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.131
But I have fooled him a bunch of times,
so, duh, it's shame on him.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.142
It's cruel, Joy.

06:18.244 --> 06:21.270
You didn't just con him out of
thousands of dollars. He loves that kid.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.282
How's he gonna feel if he finds out
Mbungo doesn't even exist?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.284
Well, you better not
tell him the truth...

06:26.386 --> 06:29.048
'cause you'll ruin Christmas
for a lot of people in this trailer park.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.055
What?

06:31.157 --> 06:34.422
<i>[Earl Narrating] Turns outJoy was so proud</i>
<i>ofkeeping the African orphan scheme going...</i>

06:34.527 --> 06:37.087
<i>she couldn't resist bragging</i>
<i>to her friends in the trailer park.</i>

06:37.196 --> 06:42.065
<i>Her friend Sylvia used some barbecue ashes</i>
<i>to fake a disaster photo.</i>

06:42.168 --> 06:44.898
[Sobbing]

06:45.004 --> 06:48.667
<i>Then she sent Mr. Hill</i>
<i>a letter asking for donations...</i>

06:48.775 --> 06:51.300
<i>for families who lost</i>
<i>their homes in wildfires.</i>

06:52.612 --> 06:54.580
<i>Tammy went the other way.</i>

06:59.452 --> 07:01.420
<i>She sent Mr. Hill a letter</i>
<i>asking for donations...</i>

07:01.521 --> 07:04.149
<i>for families displaced by floods.</i>

07:04.257 --> 07:07.249
<i>And pretty soon, he was</i>
<i>sending monthly checks to everybody.</i>

07:07.360 --> 07:10.158
- <i>This is wrong, Joy, and you know it.</i>
- Says you.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.232
Sure I took from one person,
but I gave the idea to two other people...

07:13.332 --> 07:15.800
which means I have given
twice as much as I have taken.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.097
So suck on that.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.642
Hair: Tastes like marijuana.

07:29.515 --> 07:32.416
Joy's not gonna
budge on this, Randy.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.316
I don't want to, but maybe
I should just write Mr. Hill a check...

07:35.421 --> 07:37.821
for all the moneyJoy and her friends
conned him out of.

07:37.924 --> 07:40.222
[Groans]
Snoopy tastes horrible.

07:40.326 --> 07:44.160
I think writing a check is the only way
I can cross Mr. Hill off my list.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.823
<i>Oh, God. That's terrible.</i>

07:46.933 --> 07:49.299
Randy, just fold the paper over, okay?

07:53.406 --> 07:56.341
<i>Well, I hope you're happy.</i>

07:56.442 --> 08:00.902
Oh, my God! Mr. Hill had a stroke and died?
This is horrible.

08:01.013 --> 08:04.176
I just took a close-up picture of EarlJunior
with flies in the corner of his eyes.

08:04.283 --> 08:07.810
Do you know how hard it is to get a kid
and a fly to hold still for a picture?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.751
Read the rest of the obituary.

08:09.856 --> 08:14.054
"Mr. Hill is leaving everything
to his three favorite charities:

08:14.160 --> 08:18.028
"Pimmit Hills African Relief,
Pimmit Hills Wildfire Victims...

08:18.130 --> 08:21.099
and Pimmit Hills Flood Helpers
Give Us Money Fund."

08:21.200 --> 08:24.727
Darnell! Mbungo's sugar daddy
just took a dirt nap, and we're rich!

08:24.837 --> 08:26.771
Not if I have anything to say about it.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.239
<i>I'm gonna cross</i>
<i>Mr. Hill off my list...</i>

08:29.342 --> 08:32.277
by making sure you and your friends
never get that money.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.677
That's my money, Earl Hickey. Don't you
mess with me. You know what I'm capable of.

08:35.781 --> 08:37.908
You know why you only got nine toes.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.418
<i>[Earl Narrating] So me and Randy</i>
<i>headed over to Mr. Hill's house.</i>

08:41.521 --> 08:45.753
This'll be just like old times-
breaking into a house.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.292
You think we can steal
a few things too?

08:48.394 --> 08:50.988
I brought a grocery list
of stuff we're out of.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.224
Deodorant, Fig Newtons, underwear.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.232
Randy, we're not taking anything.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.928
We just have to find something
with Mr. Hill's lawyer's name on it...

08:58.037 --> 09:00.631
so we can tell the lawyer
those charities are fake.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.742
I knew it. That bastard's trying
to screw up our inheritance.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.752
Oh, my God. This is it.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.913
It's his will.

09:17.023 --> 09:21.016
"Charities shall receive monies
in the amount of $280,000."

09:21.127 --> 09:23.152

09:25.731 --> 09:27.995
The lawyer's name and address
are right here.

09:31.470 --> 09:35.270
They found the will.
That old coot was holding on to $280,000.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.207
Bling! I'm gonna buy a fur coat
with the little head still on it...

09:38.311 --> 09:41.906
so people will stare and I'll be all,
"Yeah, this bitch is real."

09:42.014 --> 09:44.915
Yeah! Get down.
They're comin' out.

09:50.089 --> 09:54.355
We gotta get that will away from 'em.
We'll just keep following 'em real quiet.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.526
- [Engine Starts]
- ## [Stereo: Loud Rock]

09:59.632 --> 10:04.535
It's Joy. She must've figured out
we have the will. We gotta split up.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.197
You take the will and start walking
to the lawyer's office.

10:07.306 --> 10:10.366
Joy will be sure I kept it,
and she'll follow me.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.536

- What are you doin'?

10:13.646 --> 10:17.309
I'm pretendin' I'm mad at you,

10:22.521 --> 10:24.421
What do you mean you hate our troops?

10:24.523 --> 10:26.423

- [Gasps]
- Hand me the will, dummy.

10:44.243 --> 10:47.303
Uh, maybe you should
give <i>me</i> the will.

10:47.413 --> 10:51.042
- I don't have the will.
- Well, I do.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.551
Not. Not. Not.
Not. Not.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.384
Not. Not. Not. Not.

Hello. We're here to pick up our checks
from the dead guy.

<i>Yes, I'm Mr. Fischer,</i>
<i>and I believe you know Mr. Hickey.</i>

- Son of a bitch.
- Hello, Joy.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.842
I knew you'd follow Randy.

11:18.944 --> 11:23.108
<i>That gave mejust enough time to get here</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>This is it. It's his will.</i>

<i>I needed to makeJoy think</i>
