00:01.269 --> 00:04.172
Experience 9-1-1 is most
thrilling season yet.

00:04.172 --> 00:08.342
Let's get you out of there,
see on new episodes Mondays.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.078
Check out her other box shows.

00:10.078 --> 00:13.147
9-1-1 Lone star,
the cleaning lady.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.482
And the Resident.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.983
Only on Fox.

00:18.986 --> 00:21.021
*

00:33.534 --> 00:38.706
Welcome-mm-mm-mm...

00:38.839 --> 00:42.042
to the beginning.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.778
As the snake

00:44.845 --> 00:47.515
sheds its skin,

00:47.615 --> 00:52.353
the butterfly emerges
from the cocoon,

00:52.453 --> 00:55.022
here at the Anant Ka Aashram,

00:55.123 --> 00:58.859
so, too, will you be reborn
and emerge fresh

00:58.959 --> 01:01.862
from this spiritual journey.

01:01.995 --> 01:05.966
Let us begin
our therapeutic session

01:06.033 --> 01:10.204
by drinking the ceremonial tea

01:10.338 --> 01:13.207
of renewal and rebirth.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.809
KATHY:
You said "rebirth."

01:15.876 --> 01:17.545
There's not placenta or anything
in this, is there?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.046
Wait, that's not a thing,
is it?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.714
Oh, a lady from
my walking group

01:20.848 --> 01:22.916
used to blend her placenta
in a smoothie.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.319
Okay, but that's not
in the tea, right?

01:25.386 --> 01:27.155
Of course not.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.259
Um, so what is?

01:31.392 --> 01:35.396
Ah, it's an ancient mystic's
recipe.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.697
Yeah, that's not an answer.

01:36.764 --> 01:40.234
Um, black, green, chai,
oolong teas

01:40.368 --> 01:42.603
mixed with matcha,
dried mushroom caps,

01:42.736 --> 01:46.374
-ginger and...
-I'm-I'm sorry, did you
just say mushrooms?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.742
As in hallucinogenic narcotics?

01:48.842 --> 01:51.011
Is that bad?
This is California.

01:51.078 --> 01:53.514
-It's a felony!
-Is it?
-REGGIE: Yeah.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.616
You just roofied us.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.254
Okay.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.257
-* I like to dream *
-Hey!

02:03.357 --> 02:04.625
* Yes, yes *

02:04.758 --> 02:05.759
* Right between
the sound machine... *

02:05.859 --> 02:06.860
(group shouting angrily)

02:06.927 --> 02:08.262
KATHY:
He's getting away.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.965
Ah, okay, should've gone
to real estate school.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.268
Oh, boy.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.437
Okay. Get in there.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.138
We almost got him.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.874
* Well, you don't know
what we can find... *

02:20.941 --> 02:24.478
Siri... call 911.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.447
Siri, call 911.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.316
Oh, Buddha.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.651
(screams)

02:36.990 --> 02:39.393
(siren wailing)

02:43.797 --> 02:45.098
Can someone tell me
what happened?

02:45.165 --> 02:48.802
We unleashed our primal selves.
(chortles)

02:49.337 --> 02:52.606
These people appear to be
hallucinating.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.741
MAN:
Hi.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.142
How would you know?

02:55.276 --> 02:57.010
You looked like this
when you were dosed.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.012
-No, I didn't.
-(scoffs) Whatever.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.949
He dosed us, man,
and then dude went over.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.185
-Over where?
-Uh...

03:05.319 --> 03:08.956
Ortiz, make sure they stay
away from the edge.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.496
(exhales)

03:15.629 --> 03:17.931
HEN:
Sir!

03:17.998 --> 03:20.000
-Are you hurt?
-(Eugene shuddering)

03:20.133 --> 03:23.604
I, uh, I think I sprained
my ankle on the way down.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.507
-We're gonna come down
and get you.
-Oh, thank God.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.676
Okay, everybody, ladder rescue.
Hen, Chim, prep a basket.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.378
Buck, Ravi, start extending

03:30.511 --> 03:31.812
that ladder
over the edge of the cliff.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.447
Uh, Cap,
I-I was gonna harness up.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.849
I'm gonna go down to get him.
Donato, you're with me.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.050
Yeah, copy that, Cap.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.719
You riding the ropes, Cap?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.354
What, did I stutter?
Let's move!

03:44.525 --> 03:46.827
(brakes squeak)

04:03.377 --> 04:04.878
Go.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.855
BOBBY:
You set?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.924
-Set.
-All right, let's go.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.564
All right, Eugene, you
hang tight. We're almost there.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.434
Oh, thank God. Whoa.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.273
All right, Ravi, basket's ready

04:33.407 --> 04:34.608
as soon as Cap is.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.076
(rumbling)

04:36.209 --> 04:38.278
Wait, did you feel that?
Was that a quake?

04:39.079 --> 04:41.214
Guys, what the hell was that?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.121
The cliff's going.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.426
That didn't feel right, Cap.

04:52.560 --> 04:56.063
Cap, Lucy, unhook now.
The cliff's coming down,

04:56.129 --> 04:57.130
and it's taking the ladder
with it.

04:57.264 --> 05:00.133
CHIMNEY:
Everybody fall back!

05:02.803 --> 05:04.605
BOBBY:
All right, Lucy, unhook.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.416
Get down!

05:33.467 --> 05:34.635
Cap!

05:38.606 --> 05:39.840
(exhales)

05:41.108 --> 05:42.676
That-That-That's bad,

05:42.810 --> 05:44.344
-right?
-Yeah, Eugene.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.079
That's bad.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.451
NEWSMAN: Quite the predicament
for these first responders.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.821
Turns out they needed
some second responders.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.355
Must we keep reliving this?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.258
-It's on every channel.
-Then shut it off.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.693
...LAFD paramedic
Jonah Greenway.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.629
Our Taylor Kelly
has a fresh report on that

06:01.695 --> 06:02.963
coming up next.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.834
-BOBBY: This wasn't
a punishment, Buck.
-Come on, Cap.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.003
-I-I know everyone is mad
about Taylor's story.
-No one is mad.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.539
Chief Alonzo seemed pretty mad

06:11.672 --> 06:13.441
-when he was interrogating me.
-This was a hearing

06:13.507 --> 06:15.509
-about Jonah, Buck.
Not an interrogation.
-No,

06:15.643 --> 06:17.778
the interrogation
came after the hearing

06:17.845 --> 06:19.212
in his office.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.348
He wanted to know
all these things about Taylor.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.116
You know, wh-where does she get
her information?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.518
Who are her sources?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.687
-Am I one of them?
-They were embarrassed.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.689
It would have been better
for the department

06:28.789 --> 06:30.323
if they could have released
this story themselves,

06:30.390 --> 06:31.892
controlled the narrative
a little bit.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.962
I think they would have liked
a heads-up. That's all.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.730
Yeah, well,
they aren't the only ones.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.966
She promised me, Cap.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.734
She promised me
she wouldn't do the story,

06:40.868 --> 06:42.402
and I believed her.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.005
I'm sorry I let you down.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.340
This wasn't your fault, Buck.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.043
You know, I can't even blame
Taylor for all this.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.311
She's a reporter.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.379
She wasn't the one
running around,

06:52.480 --> 06:55.182
playing God right under my nose.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.718
Cap, you couldn't have known.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.386
I should have!

07:00.187 --> 07:02.322
It's my job.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.992
Sorry, kid.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.563
EDDIE:
He said that?

07:09.663 --> 07:10.864
He did.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.232
Well, you know how he is.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.001
He takes responsibility
for everything.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.536
That's his way.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.538
Probably why he makes
such a good captain.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.407
Taking responsibility for
something he didn't do wrong?

07:20.508 --> 07:23.544
(inhales)
It's a bad road to go down.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.579
You lose sight of things,

07:25.679 --> 07:27.047
of who you are.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.182
I just... I-I wish I could...

07:29.249 --> 07:31.418
-Fix it? (chuckles)
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.453
I'm the guy that always wants
to fix everything.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.789
Hey, comes in handy
when you have a bunch

07:35.923 --> 07:36.890
of holes in your wall.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.258
Also sounded like

07:38.391 --> 07:41.529
maybe you needed a reason
to get out of the house.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.633
Uh, yeah.

07:45.766 --> 07:49.036
Taylor and I
are still avoiding each other.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.972
-Mm.
-I-I know we-we have to talk.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.574
I still feel so angry.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.776
Feel like whatever I say

07:55.876 --> 07:57.310
is just gonna be mean.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.446
You can't put it off forever.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.116
You keep that anger
and resentment bottled up?

08:03.250 --> 08:05.118
Eventually you snap.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.254
(Bobby grunts)

08:08.055 --> 08:09.657
(sighs)

08:09.790 --> 08:11.792
Mom? Bobby?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.961
(grunts)
Damn it.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.395
Yeah?

08:17.731 --> 08:19.800
(exhales)

08:20.601 --> 08:23.103
-Hey.
-Oh, no, what happened?

08:23.170 --> 08:26.306
Uh, I was just cleaning up
before dinner,

08:26.406 --> 08:28.475
and I somehow managed
to break a glass.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.944
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah,
it's just a scratch.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.313
-Uh, I tell you what, let me
just clean this up, and...
-Oh, no.

08:33.413 --> 08:37.084
I got it. You clean that cut
and maybe change your shirt.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.453
Oh, yeah.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.422
That's probably not
the most appetizing thing

08:42.489 --> 08:44.157
for your celebration dinner.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.493
What do you mean, "celebration"?

08:47.628 --> 08:49.296
Mom and Harry are about to walk

08:49.362 --> 08:51.131
through that door
with a congratulatory

08:51.198 --> 08:53.000
"you're going to college"
balloon arrangement,

08:53.133 --> 08:56.169
-aren't they?
-There might be some USC
sweatshirts involved, as well.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.671
-Okay.
-Tell you what,

08:57.771 --> 08:59.339
I'm gonna go change
before they get back.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.675
Yeah. So much
for my surprise announcement.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.713
(whispers):
Oh, my gosh.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.547
(glass crunches)

09:21.194 --> 09:23.697
You were right. Fish tacos here

09:23.797 --> 09:25.032
are pretty damn good.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.367
Though still
probably not as good

09:27.500 --> 09:29.036
-as Andrea's.
-Andrea's.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.537
(Chimney chuckles softly)

09:30.671 --> 09:32.172
So, I, I just wanted us
to talk through some stuff

09:32.239 --> 09:34.374
without our tiny human
interrupting.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.310
(music playing faintly)

09:42.683 --> 09:44.417
I'm okay with it.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.355
If you feel you're ready,
then I support you completely.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.858
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.493
I know it didn't work out
with us, but...

09:53.560 --> 09:57.397
I still want you to be happy,
so if you think it's time...

09:57.530 --> 10:00.167
What do you think
that I think we're ready for?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.736
Dating. Other people.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.738
Going back to work.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.374
That's what I was gonna
talk to you about.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.209
-Oh, so not dating?
-Well, I mean,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.211
if you're ready
to start dating...

10:11.278 --> 10:14.047
No. No, I'm not... No.
I mean, I'm-I'm-I'm...

10:14.114 --> 10:17.084
(chuckles): Can we start
this conversation over, please?

10:17.184 --> 10:18.618
(chuckles)

10:18.752 --> 10:21.054
Okay. I would like
to go back to work.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.257
At the call center. And I know
that it's gonna complicate

10:24.357 --> 10:26.259
the schedule
that we've already worked out,

10:26.359 --> 10:27.560
and we'll take a hit financially
with day care,

10:27.627 --> 10:29.930
-but...
-You miss helping people.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.299
I guess I didn't realize
how much that place

10:32.432 --> 10:34.067
really mattered to me
until I saw it burning

10:34.134 --> 10:35.568
on television.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.538
I never should have walked away.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.477
They'd be glad
just to have you back.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.614
-(door opens)
-CHIMNEY: Hey.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.283
Lunch clearly went well.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.419
You're in a much better mood
than when you left.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.454
I'm guessing the talk
with Maddie was good.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.157
(exhales) She wasn't asking
for permission to date anyone.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.227
-You were wrong
about that one, little brother.
-That is not

11:00.293 --> 11:01.628
how I remember
the conversation going.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.296
You were the one
who was spiraling.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.998
-I believe I told you to chill.
-I do not spiral.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.968
Yeah, well, maybe you would
if you took one of these.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.770
What is...

11:10.503 --> 11:12.973
Career aptitude test.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.441
ALBERT:
Now that I've quit
the fire department,

11:14.507 --> 11:16.143
I'm gonna have to start over.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.978
Won't be following
in your footsteps.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.680
-Definitely won't be following
in Father's, so...
-(chuckles)

11:20.814 --> 11:23.751
Guess I have to find
other footsteps.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.419
CHIMNEY:
Wow. Archaeologist.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.956
Librarian. Sociologist.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.323
Trial lawyer?

11:30.423 --> 11:31.691
You don't think
I'd make a good lawyer?

11:31.825 --> 11:34.027
-I don't know. I don't see it.
-(chuckles)

11:34.161 --> 11:36.329
There you go. That's you.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.199
-What?
-Cosmetologist.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.836
(music playing faintly)

11:44.004 --> 11:45.538
DEENA:
Dontrell.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.008
Deena. Hey. What brings you in?

11:48.108 --> 11:49.542
Without an appointment.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.511
Something's wrong. Ever since

11:51.611 --> 11:53.847
you put in these extensions
last week, I've had

11:53.981 --> 11:55.648
-these headaches.
-Oh, I warned you
that might happen.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.317
It's gonna be
a little tight at first,

11:57.384 --> 11:58.886
but it'll slowly loosen up.
Just give it some time, okay?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.520
This isn't tight.
It's crippling pain.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.023
Hey, being pretty ain't pretty.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.226
DEENA:
I want you
to take them out now.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.195
Start over
and do it right this time.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.997
Deena, don't you think you're
being a little overdramatic?

12:10.063 --> 12:13.400
I have a one-star review,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.970
Raquel, sweetie,
why don't you give us a minute?

12:17.037 --> 12:18.906
Why don't you try
a espresso from over there?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.207
Okay.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.374
Have a seat.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.710
(Deena sighs)

12:25.712 --> 12:28.148
It hurts the most in the back,
right in the crown.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.350
This isn't cool, Deena.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.385
I'm not a fan
of doing my work twice.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.721
You should have done it right
the first time.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.691
-Oh, my God.
-DEENA: What?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.728
Oh, my gosh.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.072
HEN:
BP's a little low,
but his heart sounds good.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.740
Pupils are equal and reactive,

12:53.841 --> 12:57.444
so we can rule out
any sort of TBI or hematoma.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.179
-(Dontrell whimpers)
-CHIMNEY: Easy.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.680
You got a pretty nasty bump

13:00.747 --> 13:02.115
-on your head. You're gonna...
-His head?!

13:02.249 --> 13:04.017
-What about mine?
-Ma'am, I'm afraid your stylist

13:04.084 --> 13:05.886
is out of commission for the
day. You're gonna have to find

13:05.953 --> 13:07.754
somebody else to deal
with your hair emergency.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.891
Then you have to help me, okay?
My head, it's throbbing.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.460
Ever since he put these
extensions in a few days ago,

13:13.593 --> 13:16.129
I've had
these blinding headaches.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.266
You keep scissors in that thing,
right? Can you cut it out?

13:19.366 --> 13:21.268
-HEN: Uh...
-BOBBY: Uh,

13:21.401 --> 13:23.570
Hen, can you come
and take a look at this?

13:24.371 --> 13:25.272
DEENA:
What?

13:25.405 --> 13:26.806
Uh, just-just hold still.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.807
Okay.

13:27.941 --> 13:28.909
Uh...

13:28.976 --> 13:30.277
-Hen, aren't those...?
-HEN: Whoa.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.444
Maggots.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.047
(screams)
You did this to me!

13:34.114 --> 13:36.116
-(gasping)
-Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.284
-What's your name?
-Deena.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.919
HEN:
Okay, Deena, have a seat.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.087
Okay? I'm Hen.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.454
Okay? I can't help you

13:41.588 --> 13:43.123
unless you calm down.
Take a deep breath.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.225
-(gasping)
-Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.628
-All right.
You might need these. Here.
-HEN: Yeah.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.466
-Hold the light while I try
to cut one of these out.
-Ugh.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.003
(Deena whimpers)

13:56.136 --> 13:59.139
-HEN: Yep. Live larva.
-(Deena groans)

13:59.272 --> 14:00.840
It's mostly superficial.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.977
-No sign
of systemic parasitic infection.
-Ugh.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.813
But it's definitely
an infestation.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.649
Oh, God,
I think I'm gonna be sick.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.918
HEN:
You're gonna be okay, all right?

14:10.984 --> 14:12.419
We're gonna get you
to the hospital,

14:12.485 --> 14:13.954
and they're gonna take
good care of you.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.188
BOBBY:
Okay, let's clean her up
as best we can,

14:15.322 --> 14:16.789
get-get her ready for transport.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.191
We should try
to get 'em out now.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.526
Otherwise, they're gonna
remove them surgically,

14:19.659 --> 14:21.161
shave her head.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.830
Shave my head? I can't
walk around with a shaved head.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.298
(gasping)

14:25.365 --> 14:26.333
I don't have
your bone structure.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.700
I could never pull it off.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.672
Do you mind telling me
how the hell this could happen?

14:32.772 --> 14:35.008
-I-I have no idea.
-Well, you had to get the hair

14:35.142 --> 14:36.709
-from somewhere, right?
-Well, yeah.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.511
I-I-I-I mean, I-I had to...

14:38.611 --> 14:40.047
-And?
-You don't understand.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.482
Like, it's so hard finding
real human hair right now.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.551
Everything's back-ordered. The
supply chain's all messed up.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.785
I was gonna lose clients.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.121
Where did you get the hair?

14:48.188 --> 14:50.123
(siren wails)

14:59.699 --> 15:01.334
Can I help you, Officer?

15:01.401 --> 15:05.372
-You're Gregory Abewell
of Abewell Mortuary?
-Yes.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.840
-I-Is there a problem?
-We need

15:07.907 --> 15:09.909
to have a talk, Mr. Abewell.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.079
About what?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.714
(sighs)

15:16.516 --> 15:17.684
HEN:
I'd heard about folks

15:17.750 --> 15:19.486
illegally harvesting tissue
and bones

15:19.552 --> 15:20.988
from dead people, but hair?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.656
Hmm. That's why I stick
to au naturel.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.893
-(chuckles softly)
-Half the time, you don't know
what people trying to sell you.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.528
CLIVE:
And I am more than fine

15:28.595 --> 15:30.063
with the authentic Antonia.

15:30.197 --> 15:33.066
That poor woman must have spent
hundreds of dollars

15:33.166 --> 15:35.502
to get her hair done
only to end up in the hospital.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.903
Not to mention
a lifetime of nightmares.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.938
Do they lay eggs or something
in your head?

15:39.072 --> 15:40.673
-Uh...
-Wait, could they burrow
into your brain?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.742
Okay,
I think we need a new topic

15:42.875 --> 15:44.844
-of conversation.
-(chuckles)

15:44.911 --> 15:48.081
Well,
Clive and I have some news.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.950
I have asked your mother

15:51.084 --> 15:54.921
to do me the honor
of becoming my wife.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.257
And I said yes.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.858
Ma! That's amazing.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.861
We are so happy for you two.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.396
DENNY:
Congratulations, Grammy.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.232
Do I get to call you
Grandpa now?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.467
-You can call me
whatever you like.
-(chuckles)

16:07.600 --> 16:10.103
HEN:
I-I can't believe
you're gonna make it official.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.105
I kind of thought
that you had given up

16:12.205 --> 16:14.441
-on that entire institution.
-TONI: Well,

16:14.541 --> 16:17.210
it turns out not all marriages
are fiery hellscapes.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.712
-(Karen chuckles)
-Yours seems to be doing okay.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.781
HEN:
So, what are you thinking?

16:21.881 --> 16:24.217
Family trip to Vegas
could be fun.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.718
Actually,

16:25.785 --> 16:28.088
we were hoping to do it here.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.457
Maybe in the backyard?

16:30.557 --> 16:32.592
-O-Our backyard?
-TONI: Yeah.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.993
Make it a real wedding,

16:34.127 --> 16:36.563
especially since
it's Clive's first time.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.798
CLIVE:
First and last.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.900
Mwah.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.270
TONI:
So,

16:43.336 --> 16:45.138
you guys okay with that?

16:45.238 --> 16:46.239
Ma, I think it would...

16:46.306 --> 16:47.974
-(silverware clangs)
-(chair scoots)

17:01.688 --> 17:03.356
What was that?

17:03.490 --> 17:05.658
She didn't come to our wedding,

17:05.758 --> 17:07.160
Hen. The one we had right here

17:07.260 --> 17:09.629
in the same backyard
she wants to get married in.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.431
She apologized. We forgave her.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.832
-(Karen sighs)
-Didn't we?

17:12.932 --> 17:14.867
I-I love Toni. I do.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.836
And having her here
has changed our family

17:16.969 --> 17:18.471
in the best way, but...

17:18.538 --> 17:21.841
Oh, the thought of, of her
getting married here just...

17:21.941 --> 17:24.211
Karen, I can't believe
you're still bothered by this.

17:24.344 --> 17:28.715
Yes, my mother
didn't come to our wedding.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.685
But I've found a way
to let it go.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.688
It was still a beautiful day.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.691
You didn't see the look
on your face.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.060
You met me at the altar

17:41.194 --> 17:44.331
and turned to see
if she was there.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.300
And there was an empty chair.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.737
And I watched your heart break

17:50.870 --> 17:53.173
before we even said "I do."

17:53.240 --> 17:57.043
It wasn't the happiest day
of our life, Hen.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.218
But it was still
a pretty damn good one.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.021
Hmm?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.391
Yeah. It was.
(chuckles)

18:11.524 --> 18:14.727
Listen, if you don't want them
to get married here, it's okay.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.397
But I need you to talk to her.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.567
I don't want this
to become a thing.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.335
I'll fix it.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.180
(crying):
I'm sorry.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.248
I didn't mean...

18:35.382 --> 18:38.851
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.722
Of course you can have
your wedding here.

18:49.396 --> 18:52.599
MADDIE:
(sighs) This is... interesting.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.100
-Everybody hates it.
-(chuckles)

18:54.234 --> 18:56.269
It was supposed to be
some new communal workspace.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.272
Opened right before the pandemic
and closed two months later.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.442
-Well, at least you have
buzzword salad on the walls.
-(Josh sighs)

19:02.575 --> 19:04.977
It's just temporary until
the new space is ready for us.

19:05.111 --> 19:08.281
-And when's that gonna be?
-Mid-September, I think?

19:08.381 --> 19:09.449
Welcome back, Maddie.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.783
There's doughnuts
in the breakroom.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.452
Oh, I'm good,
but it's nice to see you.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.322
Sir, I understand your car being
towed feels like an emergency...

19:15.455 --> 19:18.124
We're sharing the breakroom with
the accounting firm next door.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.126
The good news is,
they always have doughnuts.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.828
-Bad news is...
-They always have doughnuts.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.130
Maddie, welcome back.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.398
(both chuckle)

19:25.465 --> 19:27.267
MAY:
Sir, I could just send
the police.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.469
That's what I thought.
Have a great day.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.137
(Maddie exhales)

19:32.472 --> 19:33.973
You got this.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.676
Do I? Because I thought
I was coming back to work,

19:36.809 --> 19:38.778
and now it feels
like I'm starting over.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.680
JOSH:
The space may have changed.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.516
The job hasn't.
You're gonna be great.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.752
Okay.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.089
(sighs)

19:55.928 --> 19:58.631
-(beeps)
-911.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.867
What's your emergency?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.838
(phone chimes)

20:06.639 --> 20:09.309
Ah! Maddie took her first call.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.512
-No one died.
-RAVI: That's great news.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.013
Both parts.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.186
What?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.188
No, nothing.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.990
(phone vibrates)

20:24.791 --> 20:28.060
Oh, hey.
I just got a text from my sister

20:28.194 --> 20:29.562
about her first call.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.499
I guess we can all see
Chimney still comes first.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.567
-You know, this is a sign.
I-I really think...
-Oh,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.736
is this the part of our day
where we share our opinions

20:36.869 --> 20:38.004
about
each other's relationships?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.472
-(chuckles)
-'Cause I have a few

20:39.539 --> 20:41.207
-choice words about your...
-BUCK: Okay, okay.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.209
Hey, Cap. I heard that May's
leaving the call center

20:43.343 --> 20:44.977
-for college?
-BOBBY: Yeah.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.213
Wow. You and your wife must be
really happy about that.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.848
Well,
relieved more than anything.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.817
I-I think it'll be good for her
to get away

20:50.883 --> 20:53.520
from the emergencies,
the tragedies.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.525
-I just want to say one...
-Hey, is, uh, May gonna
do anything over the summer?

20:58.591 --> 21:01.093
-Uh, she didn't get to do that
when she graduated, right?
-BOBBY: Well,

21:01.227 --> 21:03.029
she's going to Miami
with her brother Harry.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.864
And then she's gonna go visit
Athena's parents.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.066
They're gonna have a few weeks
together before school starts.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.669
Oh. She's gonna miss
the wedding.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.372
Mom doesn't have a lot
of friends left in the area.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.674
I think Karen
was hoping to draft

21:14.741 --> 21:17.510
some people to fill in
that side of the aisle.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.712
How did Karen go from hard no

21:19.779 --> 21:21.581
to planning the wedding?

21:21.681 --> 21:24.417
Overcompensating
for massive amounts of guilt.

21:24.551 --> 21:27.286
-(chuckles)
-I think it's sweet
that Karen was defending you.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.221
I mean, isn't that
what we all want in a partner?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.424
Knowing
that they have your back?

21:31.558 --> 21:35.261
Yeah.
Until they stick a knife in it.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.063
You really need to talk to her.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.400
I think maybe I'm just gonna
hope it works itself out.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.935
Just do us all a favor.
Stay away from the tequila

21:43.069 --> 21:45.071
until you've made
a rational decision

21:45.137 --> 21:46.906
-about that situation.
-CHIMNEY: Yeah.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.376
We like Lucy.
So next time you go kissing

21:49.442 --> 21:52.278
on her again,
you're the one who has to leave.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.948
-(mouths)
-When did you two kiss?

21:56.048 --> 21:58.250
Two months ago.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.920
I feel like I am missing
warning signs left and right.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.922
Bobby, there are some things

22:02.989 --> 22:05.558
that subordinates
do not tell captains.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.294
-Or sergeants.
-I still should have known.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.129
But the fact
that you haven't noticed means

22:10.229 --> 22:12.899
that it hasn't been a problem,
right?

22:12.965 --> 22:14.467
I guess.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.969
(scoffs softly) But you're
in your own head about it.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.138
Like everything else.

22:24.276 --> 22:27.480
You know, I'm kind of jealous
of May and Harry.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.316
When was the last time
we had a vacation?

22:30.417 --> 22:32.852
-What, just us together?
-Exactly.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.655
And we have had a year.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.624
What would you say

22:37.690 --> 22:41.127
to us taking the honeymoon
that we never had?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.131
I feel like
there's so much happening

22:45.197 --> 22:47.133
right now. I don't...

22:48.000 --> 22:50.437
I just need some time
to think about it.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.112
Cole, it's time.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.147
Yeah, okay, baby.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.849
Baby. Hospital. Now.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.484
-Baby. Come on. Let's go.
-Baby.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.519
-Okay. Okay. All right.
-Let's... (groaning)

23:06.653 --> 23:08.154
COLE:
All right, all right. Okay.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.622
-AMARI: Okay.
-COLE: We got this. We got this.

23:09.689 --> 23:10.823
AMARI:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.493
-(groans, exhales)
-Okay. Okay.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.361
-All right.
-Shoes.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.829
-Shoes. Shoes. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

23:16.896 --> 23:17.964
-Shoes. Yes, yes.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.198
-We're good. We're good.
-Okay.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.067
We got it.
Get that foot in there.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.035
-We're good. Let's just...
-Doing amazing.
We're doing amazing.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.371
Yes. Got it. Okay.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.540
-(exhales) Okay.
-All right, let me grab the bag.

23:27.674 --> 23:28.975
(Amari breathing deeply)

23:29.041 --> 23:31.711
All right, charger. Okay.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.713
-(Amari groans)
-Okay,

23:33.846 --> 23:36.382
-okay, okay, okay.
So, I got laptop. Charger.
-Yes.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.650
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-Toothpaste.

23:37.717 --> 23:38.985
-Baby bag.
-Yeah.

23:39.051 --> 23:39.886
-Think I remembered everything.
-Yes.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.054
You always do. Let's go.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.389
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.158
Okay, okay. Okay.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.894
-Okay.
-You doing okay?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.762
-Good? All right.
-All good.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.731
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.500
(grunts, exhales)

23:53.566 --> 23:55.535
Okay. Yeah.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.509
(both exhale)

24:06.879 --> 24:09.415
-All right.
-(engine starts)

24:15.087 --> 24:16.556
(Amari gasps)

24:30.302 --> 24:32.572
MADDIE:
Hello?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.441
Are you there?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.477
Hello?

24:39.278 --> 24:41.247
Is anyone there? Are you okay?

24:41.313 --> 24:44.951
Um, there's been an accident.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.452
Are you injured?

24:46.586 --> 24:48.755
COLE:
I don't... I think...

24:49.556 --> 24:51.457
I think
s-something bad happened.

24:51.558 --> 24:54.060
I need you to stay
on the line with me, sir.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.996
-I'm here.
-Okay.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.765
(typing)

24:58.831 --> 25:00.800
Help is on the way.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.735
(siren wailing)

25:03.502 --> 25:06.138
Buck, Lucy, saws and Jaws.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.339
MADDIE:
118, be advised,

25:07.473 --> 25:08.407
driver is semiconscious.

25:08.474 --> 25:09.642
We've lost contact.

25:09.742 --> 25:10.910
Dispatch,
I've also got a passenger.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.679
A pregnant woman.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.314
Copy that.
Driver did not report it.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.149
Sending additional ambulance.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.587
BOBBY:
Okay, Hen, you check on Mom.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.254
Chimney, you've got Dad.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.824
Cap, I-I need a way in.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.259
All right, right here.

25:31.530 --> 25:35.134
(grunts)
How you doing in here?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.669
Cole.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.138
CHIMNEY:
Cap, he's wedged in there
pretty tight.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.273
-It's gonna take
some time to get him out.
-HEN: I can't get her out

25:41.340 --> 25:43.776
without getting him out,
and I need to get her out now.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.011
How many weeks are you?

25:45.144 --> 25:46.679
AMARI:
Um, 38.

25:46.813 --> 25:49.481
We were on our way to...

25:49.548 --> 25:51.550
Were you in labor
before the accident?

25:51.684 --> 25:53.620
-(Amari panting)
-CHIMNEY: Hey, Cole.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.454
You've been in an accident.
You took quite a hit.

25:55.521 --> 25:58.357
Let me just check your vitals.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.530
Cap, one pupil is less reactive.
We got

26:04.664 --> 26:06.165
-to get him out of here.
-Copy that.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.868
-How's Mom and baby?
-(grunts) Angle's bad.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.703
I can't get a heartbeat.

26:10.803 --> 26:11.971
Oh, God.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.806
-It doesn't mean
there isn't one.
-BOBBY: Okay,

26:13.873 --> 26:15.742
everybody, clear the vehicle.
Let's cut 'em out.

26:24.050 --> 26:27.186
(whirring)

26:32.191 --> 26:34.393
(siren wailing)

26:35.728 --> 26:36.729
Is the baby okay?

26:36.863 --> 26:38.898
Please tell me he's okay.

26:38.998 --> 26:42.735
-No other pain
besides the contractions?
-No.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.840
So, we're doing this again?

26:47.907 --> 26:50.943
-How come we're doing it again?
-CHIMNEY: Uh,

26:51.077 --> 26:53.112
I just wanted an update.

26:53.245 --> 26:57.283
Hey, Cap, can you call ahead
and set up a TBI protocol?

26:57.416 --> 26:59.018
What does that mean?

26:59.085 --> 27:00.753
Water was clear. No meconium.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.756
From what I can tell,
you're eight centimeters

27:03.890 --> 27:05.624
and almost fully effaced.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.194
Can you tell me
your name again, sir?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.862
So, we're doing that again, too?

27:09.929 --> 27:12.264
-It's Cole.
-CHIMNEY: That's right.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.100
Now, can you tell me
what year it is, Cole?

27:14.233 --> 27:15.802
COLE:
Course I can.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.604
It's two thousand...

27:19.371 --> 27:22.909
Uh, two thousand...

27:23.910 --> 27:25.444
Sorry.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.781
There it is.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.750
-(exhales)
-The heartbeat is strong.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.452
You're gonna have
this baby soon, Amari.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.321
But not in this ambulance.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.260
What about Cole?

27:42.061 --> 27:44.897
CHIMNEY:
Can you tell me
who the president is?

27:44.964 --> 27:45.965
COLE:
President?

27:46.098 --> 27:47.633
It's...

27:47.734 --> 27:50.269
-It's that old guy. Um...
-It's okay.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.804
You're just foggy
from the head trauma.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.672
We need to keep you alert
and awake.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.074
Believe me,

27:55.141 --> 27:57.643
having your first child
will definitely do that for you.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.511
I'm having a kid?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.584
Is he all right?

28:05.651 --> 28:08.620
We're bringing your husband in
for further observation.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.857
Oh, Cole! Cole.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.159
I called my sister.
She's on the way.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.294
She's gonna record everything
so you don't have to miss it.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.628
Miss what?

28:16.695 --> 28:17.997
Cole?

28:18.130 --> 28:19.665
Do I know you?

28:19.766 --> 28:21.968
I don't... I don't know her.
Do I know her?

28:22.034 --> 28:24.303
(Amari panting)

28:24.370 --> 28:25.838
-Okay.
-Try to relax.

28:25.972 --> 28:29.508
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

28:30.309 --> 28:33.012
* Said my name *

28:33.112 --> 28:34.814
* So quietly... *

28:34.881 --> 28:36.883
So, how much time
do you think he lost?

28:37.016 --> 28:38.317
At least six or seven years.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.452
Hen said
with this type of amnesia,

28:40.519 --> 28:43.189
there's a-a chance
his memories might come back.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.224
Or there'll just be
a big black hole

28:45.357 --> 28:47.126
in the middle of his life.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.694
You remember that movie?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.662
The woman,
she-she wakes up every morning,

28:50.729 --> 28:53.565
and her brain resets
to a year ago, so anything

28:53.699 --> 28:56.202
she does today,
she won't remember tomorrow.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.170
Yeah, that was
anterograde amnesia.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.471
Works a little differently.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.307
It still sounds
like a nightmare.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.675
You know, starting over
every day.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.512
Always doing the same thing,
making the same mistakes.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.480
Never having a chance to learn

29:08.547 --> 29:10.416
or make a different decision.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.484
Like a hamster on a wheel.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.520
It was a comedy.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.089
I think
it's supposed to be romantic.

29:17.223 --> 29:20.592
You know, the idea that the guy
would work hard every day,

29:20.726 --> 29:22.728
making her fall in love with him
over and over again.

29:22.829 --> 29:26.065
So every day
is the best day ever.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.566
Is that really love?

29:27.699 --> 29:30.402
Right? Sh-Shouldn't it be
when you're at your worst,

29:30.502 --> 29:31.670
they're at their worst,

29:31.737 --> 29:33.339
you have every reason
to give up,

29:33.405 --> 29:36.742
and you still decide
you want to try again?

29:37.543 --> 29:39.678
I guess it is.

29:39.745 --> 29:42.381
* After all. *

29:42.448 --> 29:43.582
(monitor beeping steadily)

29:43.715 --> 29:45.417
COLE:
So, the baby's okay?

29:45.517 --> 29:47.419
Eight pounds, one ounce.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.589
They wouldn't let me bring him.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.425
(exhales)

29:53.559 --> 29:56.095
(crying):
I'm sorry.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.796
I wish...

29:57.930 --> 29:59.465
Hey. Hey.

29:59.598 --> 30:02.401
-It's all right.
-It's not.

30:05.104 --> 30:08.274
I had this whole life,

30:08.374 --> 30:09.942
and I don't remember it.

30:10.076 --> 30:12.111
I don't remember you

30:12.244 --> 30:14.780
or our son.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.449
And what if I never remember?

30:17.583 --> 30:20.452
-What if...
-Then we start over.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.124
How?

30:31.797 --> 30:34.666
I'm gonna tell you a story.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.170
What kind of story?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.639
A love story.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.448
("If I Could Build My Whole
World Around You" playing)

30:49.515 --> 30:51.350
(metal clinks)

30:52.151 --> 30:54.120
(knock on door)

30:54.186 --> 30:57.756
* Oh, if I could build
my whole world... *

30:57.823 --> 30:59.158
Hi.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.993
Hello.

31:01.093 --> 31:04.163
Did you order roti,

31:04.296 --> 31:06.332
sticky rice, grilled pork,

31:06.465 --> 31:07.766
and coconut soup?

31:07.833 --> 31:09.936
I know, it's a lot.
(chuckles)

31:10.002 --> 31:10.869
(chuckles)

31:11.003 --> 31:12.338
Wait, are you the delivery guy?

31:12.438 --> 31:14.106
I'm your neighbor.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.675
Uh, delivery guy left it
on my doorstep and ran.

31:16.775 --> 31:19.645
-I guess he was late
for the next one.
-Oh.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.847
Sorry about that.
(chuckles)

31:21.981 --> 31:25.117
Um, thank you for carrying it
the last few yards.

31:25.184 --> 31:29.188
I'm Cole, by the way.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.190
Amari. Uh...

31:31.290 --> 31:33.960
-(chuckles) Yeah.
-(chuckles)

31:34.026 --> 31:36.795
Oh, let me get that.

31:36.862 --> 31:40.166
-Delivery guy and a doorman.
-(chuckles)

31:40.232 --> 31:42.701
So, are you, uh,
new to the area?

31:42.801 --> 31:44.503
An opportunity came up, so...

31:44.570 --> 31:46.172
You know what they say.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.974
Opportunity never knocks twice.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.741
* Rest of your life *

31:49.875 --> 31:52.244
* Oh, and happiness
would surely... *

31:52.378 --> 31:53.879
You hungry?

31:54.013 --> 31:55.681
I could eat.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.849
* Oh, yes, it would *

31:57.916 --> 32:01.087
* Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo *

32:01.920 --> 32:03.722
* Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo *

32:03.822 --> 32:05.524
* Doo, doo, doo, doo *

32:05.591 --> 32:07.559
(dialogue inaudible)

32:08.394 --> 32:12.564
* Oh, if I could build
my whole world around you *

32:12.698 --> 32:16.235
* I'd give you the greatest gift
any woman could possess *

32:16.368 --> 32:21.040
* And I'd step into this world
you've created *

32:21.107 --> 32:24.410
* And give you true love
and tenderness *

32:24.510 --> 32:28.247
* And there'd be something new
with every tomorrow *

32:28.347 --> 32:32.451
* To make this world better
as days go by *

32:32.584 --> 32:36.255
* That is if I could build
my whole world around you *

32:36.388 --> 32:39.891
* If I could build
my whole world around you *

32:39.958 --> 32:43.095
* And that would be all right *

32:43.229 --> 32:44.963
* Oh, yeah *

32:45.097 --> 32:47.433
* If I could build
my whole world around you *

32:47.533 --> 32:51.770
* If I could build
my whole world around ya *

32:51.903 --> 32:54.406
* And that would be all right *

32:54.473 --> 32:55.941
* Oh, yeah *

32:56.075 --> 32:58.144
* If I could just... *

32:58.277 --> 32:59.911
Yes!

32:59.978 --> 33:04.116
* If I could build
my whole world around you *

33:04.250 --> 33:07.286
* And that would be all right,
oh, yeah *

33:07.419 --> 33:11.057
* If I could build
my whole world around you *

33:11.123 --> 33:12.624
* If I could build... *

33:12.758 --> 33:14.093
-Good?
-All good.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.161
(Amari exhales)

33:15.294 --> 33:17.796
* And that would be all right *

33:17.896 --> 33:19.465
* Oh, yeah *

33:19.598 --> 33:20.899
* If I could just *

33:20.966 --> 33:22.401
* Build my world, baby *

33:22.468 --> 33:24.770
* If I could build it,
build it *

33:24.836 --> 33:26.138
* All around you *

33:26.272 --> 33:29.007
* And that would be all right. *

33:36.014 --> 33:37.416
Buck?

33:37.483 --> 33:39.751
You home?

33:45.324 --> 33:47.526
(exhales)

33:52.298 --> 33:56.502
Well, I guess we've moved
past the avoidance stage?

33:56.635 --> 33:58.537
BUCK:
I think we can both admit

33:58.670 --> 34:01.173
it was starting
to get ridiculous.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.311
I'm sorry you're still upset
about the story.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.880
You're not sorry
for what you did, though.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.617
The story was gonna come out
regardless.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.120
If I hadn't have broken it,

34:14.186 --> 34:16.054
someone else would have.

34:16.855 --> 34:19.158
Y-You couldn't
have called me first?

34:19.225 --> 34:20.692
No, you-you just...

34:20.826 --> 34:23.362
You figured I'd be fine.
I'd get over it.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.165
Buck, I wasn't trying
to hurt you or anyone else.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.300
I was just trying
to get the truth out there.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.036
A truth the public
has every right to know.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.140
This is literally
our first argument

34:34.206 --> 34:35.241
all over again.

34:35.374 --> 34:38.043
Which is why
we shouldn't be having it.

34:38.144 --> 34:40.379
You knew who I was
when we started dating.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.249
I guess I thought
I could learn to live with it.

34:43.382 --> 34:46.552
I don't want to be something
you have to learn to live with.

34:46.652 --> 34:47.853
And I don't want
to keep on making

34:47.919 --> 34:50.356
the same mistakes.
(sniffles)

34:52.724 --> 34:56.328
I need things to be different,
Taylor.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.232
Okay.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.368
I'm willing to try that.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.338
Clean slate.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.674
Yeah.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.345
Just not together.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.386
EDDIE:
May, you got a sec?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.121
-Hey. I heard you hit
a million followers.
-Oh, yeah.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.023
That's what happens when
a ladder truck goes off a cliff.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.525
Two days of tweets
about traffic collisions

35:26.592 --> 35:28.560
-and trash fires
should take care of that.
-Yeah.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.596
What do you need?

35:30.729 --> 35:32.431
How's Bobby doing?

35:32.531 --> 35:34.433
Why would you ask me that?

35:34.533 --> 35:37.403
Probably the same reason
you're looking at me like that.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.239
The other night,
I went to the house

35:40.306 --> 35:42.774
to tell them that I'd decided
on going back to college,

35:42.908 --> 35:45.744
but when I got there,
it was weird.

35:45.811 --> 35:49.147
He had just dropped a glass
and cut his hand.

35:49.281 --> 35:52.384
-Why was that weird?
-Because the way he acted
when I came in.

35:52.451 --> 35:55.954
Felt like I was interrupting
more than just a broken glass.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.625
ATHENA:
Hey, babe. What's up?

35:59.758 --> 36:03.729
I just went out to pick up some
basics we were running low on.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.431
How's your shift?

36:05.497 --> 36:06.598
Mm, nothing much,

36:06.665 --> 36:08.767
but I'm just getting started.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.169
How are you doing?

36:11.303 --> 36:13.239
I'm good.
Gonna have an early dinner

36:13.305 --> 36:15.140
-and call it a night.
-All right.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.475
Good to hear.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.909
(knock on door)

36:17.976 --> 36:19.645
Uh, somebody's at the door,

36:19.745 --> 36:21.647
-so-so I got to run.
-All right.

36:21.747 --> 36:22.981
See you in the morning.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.083
Okay. Love you. Bye.

36:28.086 --> 36:30.522
-Eddie.
-Bobby.

36:30.656 --> 36:33.259
-Promise I don't have any
transfer requests in my hand.
-(chuckles)

36:33.325 --> 36:35.694
-All right,
then you can come in.
-All right.

36:35.827 --> 36:36.995
(door closes)

36:37.095 --> 36:38.697
Can't stay for long.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.832
I need to pick up Christopher.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.001
But, um...

36:43.835 --> 36:46.004
I wanted to say...

36:46.104 --> 36:47.606
Jonah wasn't your fault.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.509
-Eddie.
-No, look, I spent
the last few months

36:50.642 --> 36:52.478
trying to put away
a lot of things from the past

36:52.544 --> 36:53.479
and move on.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.146
What I've learned is,

36:55.213 --> 36:57.516
you can't carry
someone else's weight.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.451
It'll take you under.

36:59.518 --> 37:00.552
I'm the captain.

37:00.686 --> 37:01.953
My responsibility...

37:02.020 --> 37:03.555
Is your team.

37:04.356 --> 37:08.193
But he was on the 118
for, what, a-a few weeks?

37:09.027 --> 37:10.496
You barely knew him.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.797
You think you missed something?

37:11.863 --> 37:15.534
All the other cities,
other houses.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.835
Everybody missed something.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.137
This happened on my watch.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.874
He killed Claudette
and who knows how many others.

37:22.974 --> 37:24.876
Because he thought he was a god.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.379
But he's not.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.481
Neither are you.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.051
You're not all-knowing
and all-seeing, Bobby.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.987
You're just a good man.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.056
I'm not.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.525
I am not.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.826
You saved my life.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.728
And my son's.

37:42.828 --> 37:45.030
So, whatever responsibility
you take

37:45.096 --> 37:47.833
for Jonah, you make sure
you take some credit for me.

37:47.899 --> 37:51.069
You earned it.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.006
(sighs)
I got to go.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.509
Hey, are you sure
you can't stay for dinner?

37:57.576 --> 37:58.877
Oh, man, I'd love to,

37:58.944 --> 38:00.512
but Christopher
got some friends over,

38:00.579 --> 38:02.714
and-and I don't want to leave
Carla without backup.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.750
-Yeah, I got you.
-Yeah.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.353
Thanks for stopping by, Eddie.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.854
I mean it.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.189
Literally the least I could do,
Bobby.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.459
Thank you.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.463
(door opens)

38:18.764 --> 38:20.231
(door closes)

38:20.298 --> 38:22.368
* *

38:39.918 --> 38:42.120
*

39:02.574 --> 39:05.577
(groans)

39:12.684 --> 39:14.520
Did you order enough linens
for this one, too?

39:14.653 --> 39:17.656
I ordered
exactly what you told me to.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.324
Thought you could use a hand.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.427
Or a few hands.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.929
What are you doing here?

39:23.995 --> 39:25.263
Did you...?

39:25.330 --> 39:27.799
-No. No.
-BUCK: Come on, Hen.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.668
You know
we weren't gonna miss this.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.202
Miss what?

39:35.140 --> 39:36.141
You should ask your mom.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.342
-Hi, Karen.
-Go get a drink.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.878
-KAREN: Hey.
-EDDIE: Yeah.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.285
You're not getting married, Ma?

39:47.352 --> 39:49.621
Clive and I
can do it another time.

39:49.688 --> 39:52.357
I have four dozen deviled eggs
in the fridge.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.692
There will be a wedding today.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.360
TONI:
There will.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.162
Just not mine.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.864
-Ma...
-TONI: Henrietta,

39:58.997 --> 40:00.666
let me say this.

40:02.468 --> 40:06.171
I'm sorry I didn't come
to your wedding.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.707
I had my reasons,

40:08.840 --> 40:10.909
my excuses.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.378
I didn't understand.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.647
I wasn't ready.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.348
I needed more time to catch up

40:17.415 --> 40:19.918
with the way
the world was changing.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.888
But the truth is, honey,

40:22.988 --> 40:25.591
I was just wrong.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.092
It's okay, Toni.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.828
TONI:
No, it isn't.

40:29.895 --> 40:35.000
I don't know how you found it
in your heart to forgive me,

40:35.066 --> 40:36.935
but I'm grateful you did.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.571
We all lost something that day.

40:39.671 --> 40:44.576
I think today may be our chance
to get it back.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.382
("Closer to Fine"
by Indigo Girls playing)

40:56.588 --> 41:00.458
* I'm trying to tell you
something 'bout my life *

41:00.592 --> 41:03.428
* Maybe give me insight *

41:03.529 --> 41:05.697
* Between black and white *

41:05.764 --> 41:09.134
* And the best thing
you ever done for me *

41:11.102 --> 41:14.540
* Is to help me take my life
less seriously *

41:14.606 --> 41:17.943
* It's only life, after all *

41:18.076 --> 41:19.778
* Yeah *

41:19.878 --> 41:25.450
* Well, darkness has a hunger
that's insatiable *

41:25.551 --> 41:30.722
* And lightness has a call
that's hard to hear *

41:30.789 --> 41:34.593
* And I wrap my fear
around me like a blanket *

41:34.660 --> 41:38.897
* I sailed my ship of safety
till I sank it *

41:38.964 --> 41:40.999
* I'm crawling
on your shores... *

41:41.132 --> 41:42.300
Hey.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.670
Take good care
of yourself, Buckley.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.472
* I went to the mountains... *

41:47.606 --> 41:50.141
Yeah. You, too.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.143
* I drank from the fountains *

41:52.243 --> 41:56.481
* There's more than one answer
to these questions... *

41:56.615 --> 41:59.517
MAN:
Order up for Maddie.

41:59.651 --> 42:03.655
So, are you, uh,
headed home to eat, or...

42:03.789 --> 42:06.024
I was going to.

42:06.157 --> 42:09.327
But it does look like a nice
place to stay for a while.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.663
-You wanna...?
-Sure.

42:11.763 --> 42:13.665
(laughs)

42:13.799 --> 42:18.670
* And I went to see the doctor
of philosophy... *

42:19.270 --> 42:22.173
Hey, remember, I've got that
appointment today,

42:22.273 --> 42:23.942
so Carla's gonna pick you up
after school.

42:24.009 --> 42:25.844
-Okay?
-Okay.

42:25.944 --> 42:27.512
(sighs)

42:27.646 --> 42:31.683
Remember, talking about it
makes it less scary.

42:31.817 --> 42:33.551
* He said he could see
through me *

42:33.685 --> 42:35.186
Let's go.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.688
* I spent four years prostrate
to the higher mind *

42:36.788 --> 42:40.458
* Got my paper and I was free *

42:40.525 --> 42:43.028
* I went to the doctor *

42:43.161 --> 42:44.996
* I went to the mountains... *

42:45.063 --> 42:47.666
ATHENA:
What's this?

42:47.733 --> 42:48.967
Mm-hmm.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.637
* I drank from
the fountains... *

42:51.703 --> 42:53.004
A cruise?

42:53.071 --> 42:56.041
And the only baggage
we're taking is actual luggage.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.009
I am all for that.

42:58.076 --> 43:01.546
* And the less I seek my source
for some definitive *
