on the battlefield

00:51.760 --> 00:54.513
and bravely fought for his kingdom
in some war

Maurice, do you need a lozenge

Argh!

Give it up for Hector!

Ow! Watch it!

01:26.503 --> 01:27.713
Well, then hold still.

I am holding-- Ow!

Stop poking me!

01:30.841 --> 01:32.927
I'm trying to give you an award.

I don't care about history.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.736
Oh, me neither.

01:50.819 --> 01:54.782
The past is so old. Like Hector.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.742
I can't believe my ear holes,

01:56.825 --> 01:59.119
because what I am hearing
is a whole lot of "blah blah,"

01:59.202 --> 02:02.122
when I should be hearing
a whole lot of "rah rah!"

02:02.205 --> 02:04.583
Lemur spirit, let's go! Chop-chop!

02:05.709 --> 02:06.627
Yes!

Willie, thank you for expressing
your lemur spirit.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.634
Oh, no, actually, I was
just raising my hand

02:13.717 --> 02:15.594
to ask if we could go home now.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.262
Ugh.

Oh, yeah, Willie. Yeah, sure, yeah.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.809
Go ahead, no problem.

Go ahead and leave,

supposed to leave!

That's it. [laughs]

02:49.044 --> 02:51.130
I'm afraid to ask this,
but, what are you doing?

02:51.212 --> 02:53.090
My kingdom doesn't have spirit

02:53.172 --> 02:56.051
because they never had a war
to bond them.

02:56.135 --> 02:59.721
"Quid pro quo," I will give them a war.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.058
First, that's not what
quid pro quo means and second,

03:03.142 --> 03:05.226
I don't think starting a war
is a very good idea.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.105
That's right, Maurice.
It's a very great idea.

probably won't support a war

of flying insects will strike first.

We're framing the butterflies
for an attack

04:06.955 --> 04:09.541
in order to unite my peoples
in support of a war.

Ah! I've been reborn as a butterfly.

-Oh, Ted! Who did this to you?

06:10.662 --> 06:12.580
It was a butterfly, King Julien.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.084
An unusually large,
strange-looking butterfly. [shudders]

06:16.168 --> 06:18.920
Its face was so horribly ignorant.

-Hey!

Clover, I know you're going to say
that doesn't make any sense.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.189
That makes complete sense!

06:37.272 --> 06:38.982
I always knew those butterflies
were no good.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.399
One word, "cocoons."

06:40.483 --> 06:42.319
What goes on in there?
You tell me! Huh? Huh?

06:42.401 --> 06:44.696
But you can't, you see?
'Cause nobody knows!

06:44.779 --> 06:45.697
[all] Hmm.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.201
Listen up, everybody.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.870
The butterflies attacked our water slide.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.122
Uncool! Un-cool!

06:54.706 --> 06:56.833
Seems like we should
probably bond over this,

06:56.917 --> 06:59.336
and I don't know,
I'm just throwing out ideas,

06:59.418 --> 07:01.213
spitballing, declare war or something.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.049
Well, if King Julien
says we should go to war,

07:04.132 --> 07:05.800
then we should go to war.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.761
Of course we should!

07:07.844 --> 07:11.181
They attacked us
and destroyed our water slide.

07:11.265 --> 07:16.895
-[all chanting] We want war!
-[snarling] We want war!

07:16.978 --> 07:19.064
[chanting continues]

07:19.147 --> 07:20.190
That settles it.

07:20.274 --> 07:24.319
I hereby declare war upon the butterflies!

[all cheering]

07:27.030 --> 07:29.199
See how the people
are coming together, Maurice.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.368
You gotta admit,
my plan is totally working.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.286
Yeah, for now.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.537
But your plans always have
a way of backfiring.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.997
Yeah? Name one time.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.083
Well, there was the time
you made me go up a foosa's--

07:38.166 --> 07:39.293
Oh, hey, there's Mort.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.460
Look, King Julien,

07:40.543 --> 07:42.254
I designed it myself.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.547
Red, white and feet.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.341
-Not bad, Mort.
-[Mort giggling]

07:46.425 --> 07:49.428
Glad to see your lemur spirit
is coming out.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.846
Even if it is a little creepy.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.724
King Julien, I've alerted our Navy
to the butterfly threat.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.976
They await your orders, sir!

07:56.810 --> 07:58.186
We have a Navy?

07:58.270 --> 08:01.273
[mumbling nervously]

08:01.356 --> 08:03.566
I'd like to begin training
the new recruits.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.193
Um, train them for what?

08:05.777 --> 08:06.611
Fighting.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.488
Combat.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.073
[grunting] The war?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.908
[laughing]

08:11.992 --> 08:15.912
Oh, Clover, you clearly
know nothing about war.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.833
There won't be any fighting. [laughs]

08:19.916 --> 08:20.959
Fighting...

08:21.376 --> 08:22.543
in a war.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.089
Did you hear what she said, Maurice?
[continues laughing]

08:26.173 --> 08:28.716
Actually, the definition of "war" means--

08:28.800 --> 08:32.095
[Julien mocking]
The war is good for my people. Look.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.848
When's the last time you saw
everybody working together...

08:34.931 --> 08:35.807
[all cheering]

08:35.890 --> 08:38.477
...full of so much lemur pride
and ringtail spirit?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.104
Eh. That may be, but what do you think
is gonna happen

08:41.188 --> 08:43.190
when the butterflies
hear that we're at war?

08:43.273 --> 08:44.691
-[Maurice gulps]
-What was that? Wait, uh...

08:44.774 --> 08:45.900
-What did Maurice say?
-[Maurice hums]

08:45.984 --> 08:47.486
Nothing. He said nothing.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.989
You framed the butterflies for the attack
to start a war, didn't you?

08:51.072 --> 08:54.742
Uh... [drawling]

08:55.160 --> 08:57.704
-Technically, Maurice and Mort did.
-Really?

08:57.787 --> 09:00.957
-Argh! What?
-But don't worry, Clover.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.043
The first rule of war,

09:03.126 --> 09:05.879
is never tell your enemy you're at war.

09:05.962 --> 09:06.921
-Duh!
-Argh!

09:07.005 --> 09:08.965
The butterflies will never know.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.481
I come with news from the lemur kingdom.

09:24.523 --> 09:29.610
What has that idiotic primate
King Julien done now?

09:29.903 --> 09:30.778
Out with it!

09:30.862 --> 09:34.949
Uh, King Julien has declared war
on us, Your Highness.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.577
Finally, the moment has come!

09:37.660 --> 09:41.289
For too long, butterflies have been seen
as merely decorative.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.624
Tiny little things that just flap along
in the breeze

09:43.708 --> 09:45.585
without a thought in our heads.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.711
But no more!

09:46.794 --> 09:50.215
Now the world will see
what we're really made of!

09:50.590 --> 09:55.136
[laughing maniacally]

09:57.138 --> 10:01.142
Hello? I was just doing
an evil telepathic laugh.

10:01.226 --> 10:04.062
[sighs] Man, I wish we had lips.

I'm really going to miss that guy.

As your royal advisor,

I urge you to talk to the Butterfly Queen
and put an end to this.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.339
I cannot do that, Maurice.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.634
Not when my peoples
are finally united as one.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.718
I can't back out now!

13:21.800 --> 13:23.553
But we're unprepared for war.

We don't have an army or weapons or--

Oh, I've got weapons.

we can beat the butterflies.

-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes, Maurice.

13:43.448 --> 13:47.285
We need someone strong

-Yes! [laughs]

-Yes, Clover.

Wouldn't hurt to lower the volume
a few notches, though.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.528
Our best bet is to fortify our position.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.029
Or we should all scatter.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.240
No, no. Fortify. Nope, scatter.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.085
Oh. Did not see that coming.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.880
Finally, she's gone!

21:37.964 --> 21:40.841
Thank you, King Julien. Thank you.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.843

[all cheering]

21:55.481 --> 21:58.151
Oh, golly! Did I really explode earlier?

[Clover] Okay, out of my way.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.455
Dangerous flora coming through.
Stand clear.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.960
So, not only did I unite my own people,

22:16.043 --> 22:20.673
but I saved the entire butterfly kingdom
from their oppressive ruler.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.801
And you thought my plan would backfire.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.263
May I remind you that we're still
technically at war with the crocodiles?

22:27.345 --> 22:31.309
Oh, we took care of the crocodiles
for you, King Julien.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.227
They're in a maze!

22:33.477 --> 22:34.394
