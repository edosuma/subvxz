01:15.130 --> 01:17.298
With all the equipment
baxter left up there,

01:17.367 --> 01:20.102
we could turn that van
into a tracking station

01:20.170 --> 01:22.271
and hunt down the
technodrome but good.

01:22.339 --> 01:25.842
yeah, but how are we
gonna get it up there ?

01:25.909 --> 01:27.009
hmm.

01:33.851 --> 01:37.119
couldn't we maybe have
taken the elevator ?

01:37.187 --> 01:40.122
it wouldn't fit
in the elevator.

01:40.190 --> 01:42.391
shut up
and push !

01:47.931 --> 01:51.200
boy, check out
this junk !

01:51.268 --> 01:52.901
i bet old Donatello
could whip up

01:52.969 --> 01:54.303
some heavyweight
turtle gear

01:54.371 --> 01:55.804
with all these
spare parts, huh ?

01:55.872 --> 01:59.542
yeah, but, like,
what if baxter comes back ?

01:59.609 --> 02:01.544
ha ha.
baxter won't be back

02:01.611 --> 02:03.712
for a long time,
Michelangelo.

02:03.780 --> 02:05.514
the authorities
didn't appreciate

02:05.582 --> 02:07.416
when he tried to
take over the city

02:07.484 --> 02:08.883
with his
mouser robots.

02:08.952 --> 02:10.485
and i didn't
appreciate it

02:10.554 --> 02:12.122
when they ate
my apartment !

02:16.026 --> 02:18.728
i wonder if all this work
is worth it.

02:18.796 --> 02:21.831
it will be when we hunt
the Shredder down.

02:21.899 --> 02:24.768
<i> but why do
we have to do it ?</i>

02:24.836 --> 02:26.603
it's the humans'
problem.

02:26.671 --> 02:29.039
he seems to have it in
for you guys, too.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.841
or had you forgotten ?

02:30.908 --> 02:34.144
but us--turtles--
outcasts of society.

02:34.211 --> 02:36.079
why do we have
to stand alone

02:36.147 --> 02:38.014
against the forces
of evil ?

02:38.082 --> 02:38.982
face it, man.

02:39.050 --> 02:41.318
it's the only job
we're qualified for.

02:41.385 --> 02:43.353
oh, yeah.
you're right.

02:43.421 --> 02:45.288
well, back to work.

03:00.605 --> 03:03.407
you addlebrained idiot !

03:03.475 --> 03:08.446
you can't even beat a bunch
of miserable turtles !

03:08.513 --> 03:11.049
i refuse to give you

03:11.116 --> 03:14.285
one more iota
of my technology

03:14.352 --> 03:19.223
until you finish
building my new body !

03:19.291 --> 03:21.626
your body
is but one of many

03:21.693 --> 03:23.261
biomechanical
experiments

03:23.328 --> 03:25.896
i am conducting in
the technodrome, Krang.

03:25.964 --> 03:28.166
see ? i'm still refining

03:28.233 --> 03:30.100
my mutations
on the punks.

03:30.169 --> 03:33.671
this next batch will be
infinitely superior

03:33.738 --> 03:36.407
to these 2 losers.

03:36.475 --> 03:39.043
hey,
what do you mean ?

03:39.110 --> 03:43.581
you just
give us another shot, pal,

03:43.649 --> 03:46.116
and you'll see
some squished turtles.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.721
why are you wasting time
on mutants ?

03:49.788 --> 03:54.059
my stone warriors are
amassed in dimension x

03:54.126 --> 03:57.962
waiting to overrun
this world at my command.

03:58.030 --> 04:02.234
but i cannot let them
see me like this.

04:02.302 --> 04:03.802
dimension x...

04:03.869 --> 04:05.304
of course.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.838
the transdimensional
portal

04:06.906 --> 04:08.139
is already complete.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.342
your home dimension

04:10.410 --> 04:12.578
is a place of total
war, is it not ?

04:12.645 --> 04:16.915
yes ! a war that's been
carried on without me

04:16.982 --> 04:18.950
since i was
banished here.

04:19.017 --> 04:21.253
then i will get
the weaponry i need

04:21.320 --> 04:24.623
by pulling it
through dimension x !

04:24.691 --> 04:26.825
no ! you can't !

04:26.893 --> 04:29.628
but i must !
i, and i alone,

04:29.696 --> 04:31.496
must defeat
my ancient enemy

04:31.565 --> 04:34.833
Hamato Yoshi and his
wretched turtles !

04:34.901 --> 04:38.804
Saki ! don't !
there's no telling

04:38.872 --> 04:42.140
what might come
through that portal !

04:42.208 --> 04:43.676
finished.

04:43.743 --> 04:45.111
but the roof
needs to be

04:45.179 --> 04:46.780
at least 3 feet higher,
Donatello.

04:46.847 --> 04:48.114
huh ? why ?

04:48.182 --> 04:50.316
so i can practice
while we're driving.

04:50.384 --> 04:54.154
all this gear, and you
left out the pizza oven !

04:54.221 --> 04:55.922
look, guys,
i put every weapon

04:55.990 --> 04:57.490
i could think of
on this crate,

04:57.557 --> 05:00.059
all the surveillance
gear i could find.

05:00.127 --> 05:01.728
this is as good
as it gets.

05:01.795 --> 05:04.330
now, do you want to find
the technodrome or not ?

05:04.397 --> 05:05.765
yeah !
yeah !

05:05.833 --> 05:07.333
come on, april.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.935
let's rev this baby up
and motorvate.

05:10.003 --> 05:12.037
down the stairs ?

05:12.105 --> 05:15.475
relax, april. we'll have
gravity on our side.

05:15.542 --> 05:17.777
that's just what
scares me.

05:17.845 --> 05:19.645
seat belts,
everyone !

05:19.713 --> 05:21.614
pizza time !

05:32.626 --> 05:34.393
cowabunga !

05:34.462 --> 05:35.863
in a moment,

05:35.931 --> 05:37.898
the gateway between earth
and dimension x

05:37.966 --> 05:40.100
will be open
for the first time !

05:40.168 --> 05:41.869
all those weapons,

05:41.937 --> 05:45.773
guns from beyond our universe,
will be mine !

05:45.841 --> 05:47.174
ha ha ha ha !

05:47.241 --> 05:50.944
now... to gain the power
of dimension x !

05:51.012 --> 05:53.747
yee-haw !

05:56.250 --> 05:58.252
stop them !

06:06.495 --> 06:07.861
after them !

06:07.929 --> 06:09.763
not so fast.

06:09.831 --> 06:11.699
bail out !

06:15.804 --> 06:19.273
<i>boy, and i thought
we were weird-looking. </i>

06:19.340 --> 06:21.108
ok, bebop.

06:21.176 --> 06:23.777
let's turn
these rock faces

06:23.845 --> 06:25.312
into gravel.
ha ha !

06:29.485 --> 06:31.086
ah, this place is
dumbsville, man.

06:31.153 --> 06:32.020
let's cut out !

06:33.555 --> 06:34.756
southeast, april.

06:34.824 --> 06:36.257
roger dodger !

06:36.325 --> 06:38.293
he must've stopped
the technodrome

06:38.361 --> 06:40.195
under the global
trade center.

06:40.263 --> 06:42.663
april: that's one way
to get a parking space.

06:44.666 --> 06:46.834
wooh-hoo !
hyah-haa !

06:46.903 --> 06:48.070
go, man ! go !

06:48.137 --> 06:51.106
stop ! stop ! stop !

06:51.173 --> 06:53.474
ohh ! we was
just startin'

06:53.542 --> 06:55.476
to have fun.

06:55.544 --> 06:57.145
shut up !

06:57.213 --> 06:59.948
you are Krang's
stone warriors, are you not ?

07:00.015 --> 07:01.816
yeah. so ?

07:01.884 --> 07:03.985
there is something
i must show you.

07:04.053 --> 07:06.288
we've got to catch
those kids.

07:07.990 --> 07:11.259
the technodrome must be
right under that tower.

07:11.327 --> 07:13.695
that subway's
the only way down.

07:13.763 --> 07:15.764
let's do it !

07:17.433 --> 07:19.535
am i seeing things,
or did we just get buzzed

07:19.603 --> 07:21.937
by a couple of
rocket-powered lowriders ?

07:22.005 --> 07:23.572
you aren't
seeing things.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.840
what strange plan

07:24.908 --> 07:26.975
is the Shredder hatching
this time ?

07:27.043 --> 07:30.145
i don't know,
but we'd better find out.

07:30.213 --> 07:31.380
gun it, april !

07:37.287 --> 07:40.590
those kids must be
around here somewhere.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.927
traag !

07:44.995 --> 07:47.163
they couldn't have
just vanished.

07:47.231 --> 07:48.464
oh, sorry, lord.

07:48.531 --> 07:51.934
huh ? lord Krang !

07:55.105 --> 07:56.873
don't look at me !

07:56.940 --> 07:58.741
my lord,

07:58.809 --> 08:01.210
what has happened
to your body ?

08:01.278 --> 08:03.712
it's a long story.

08:03.781 --> 08:06.715
i lost it
when they banished me

08:06.784 --> 08:09.219
to this miserable
mud ball.

08:09.287 --> 08:11.621
those 3 youths just
blasted their way

08:11.689 --> 08:13.523
right out
of my technodrome.

08:13.591 --> 08:15.826
the neutrinos
have eluded us.

08:15.893 --> 08:17.360
neutrinos ?

08:17.428 --> 08:20.196
running loose here
on earth ?

08:20.264 --> 08:23.600
Saki, you imbecile !
why, i ought to...

08:23.668 --> 08:26.736
what did i do ?
who are these neutrinos ?

08:26.804 --> 08:29.873
a gang of
juvenile delinquents

08:29.940 --> 08:31.375
from dimension x.

08:31.442 --> 08:35.144
they're a threat
to everything we stand for.

08:35.212 --> 08:36.880
they hate war.

08:36.947 --> 08:39.215
they refuse
to join any armies.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.784
and what's worse,

08:40.851 --> 08:43.953
they encourage people
to have fun.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.261
uh, they're--
they're heading south.

08:51.329 --> 08:52.562
no, no. north !

08:52.629 --> 08:54.231
<i>uh, they're heading
south and north !</i>

08:54.298 --> 08:56.399
wah-ha-ha-ha !
daddy-o !

08:56.467 --> 08:59.069
this is one unhip
primitive society !

08:59.136 --> 09:02.073
yeah, i bet they don't
have gyroburgers !

09:02.140 --> 09:05.042
and they probably never even
heard of asteroid fizzle.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.011
our only chance
is to get ahead of them

09:07.079 --> 09:09.914
by analyzing the pattern
of where they've been.

09:09.982 --> 09:12.050
you can make a pattern
out of all of that ?

09:12.117 --> 09:14.485
we can cut 'em off
right there.

09:14.553 --> 09:15.720
take the technorover.

09:15.788 --> 09:18.689
it's the most heavily
armed vehicle we have.

09:20.125 --> 09:24.529
all right.
let's get those kids.

09:26.931 --> 09:28.700
here they come.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.235
activate
turtle-launcher !

09:31.303 --> 09:33.638
cowabunga !

09:33.705 --> 09:36.441
ok, buddies.
pull over.

09:36.508 --> 09:38.075
book 'em, dono.

09:38.143 --> 09:41.111
uhh ! i'm trying.
i'm trying.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.650
split, squares !

09:48.954 --> 09:50.955
scratch one turtle.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.193
hey, watch it.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.829
you're ruining
my finish.

10:01.334 --> 10:05.003
uhh ! ok, sister,
move to the rear.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.172
let me go,
you cube.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.976
we must capture
the pilot

10:11.043 --> 10:12.077
and force him
to land.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.613
yeah. with what ?

10:14.681 --> 10:16.181
with my elbow pad.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.852
hey ! i can't see !

10:19.919 --> 10:21.520
we're crashing !

10:23.223 --> 10:25.223
pull the stick up,
Michelangelo.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.468
aww, look what they did
to my shell.

10:36.535 --> 10:37.803
aw, keep cool.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.972
a little wax,
and it'll shine like new.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.940
Shredder must
really be desperate

10:42.008 --> 10:43.710
if he's throwing
geeks like you at us.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.144
the who ?

10:45.212 --> 10:47.313
don't tell us you never
heard of the Shredder.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.715
dig, cats--

10:48.782 --> 10:50.617
one minute we're having
a blast in dimension x,

10:50.684 --> 10:52.284
then suddenly we're in
a room with some weirdo

10:52.352 --> 10:53.552
in a metal mask.

10:53.621 --> 10:55.187
hold the phone.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.723
i think we're all
on the same side.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.326
you got 'em !

11:00.393 --> 11:01.728
who are they ?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.062
let's
interrogate them.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.797
relax, april.
they're cool.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.700
cool ? daddy-o,
we are frozen.

11:07.768 --> 11:12.071
why is it i never understand
what's going on ?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.212
oh, we sure are getting

11:20.280 --> 11:22.214
some weird characters
in here, louie.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.584
yeah, what do you expect
in this crazy town ?

11:24.652 --> 11:27.019
man, oh, man !
this is the swingingest !

11:27.087 --> 11:28.855
ha ha ha !
we didn't think

11:28.923 --> 11:31.257
you cats knew
how to have fun.

11:31.325 --> 11:32.659
yeah, we thought
this was

11:32.726 --> 11:34.161
the planet of
the squares, man.

11:34.228 --> 11:37.364
will somebody fill me in
on what's going on ?

11:37.432 --> 11:38.899
what is this dimension x ?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.467
it's grimsville.

11:40.535 --> 11:42.936
all the grownups
ever do is fight.

11:43.004 --> 11:46.173
us neutrinos are the only
ones who like having fun,

11:46.240 --> 11:49.176
and most of the time,
the grownups won't let us.

11:49.243 --> 11:51.278
they say it gets in the way
of their stupid war !

11:51.346 --> 11:52.513
that's how
we would up here.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.681
some soldiers were
after us

11:53.748 --> 11:54.881
just 'cause
we were drivin'

11:54.949 --> 11:56.116
through their dumb
old battlefield.

11:56.184 --> 11:59.119
you don't know
what it's like,

11:59.187 --> 12:00.421
living in a place

12:00.488 --> 12:02.489
where everybody
wants to do you in

12:02.557 --> 12:05.859
just for the crime
of being young.

12:05.927 --> 12:07.828
aw, don't cry,
calla.

12:09.898 --> 12:12.733
hey, we won't let anyone
hurt you here.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.234
april: i'm worried.

12:14.302 --> 12:15.736
about what,
april ?

12:15.804 --> 12:17.804
i'm worried about what
else might have come

12:17.873 --> 12:19.139
to our world
from dimension--

12:30.986 --> 12:33.121
all right,
you neutrinos,

12:33.189 --> 12:34.822
come out fighting.

12:34.890 --> 12:36.391
who are they ?

12:36.459 --> 12:38.293
stone warriors
from dimension x !

12:38.361 --> 12:39.327
they're bad.

12:39.395 --> 12:41.096
yeah,
i guessed that.

12:41.164 --> 12:43.165
you got any weapons
on those hot rods ?

12:43.232 --> 12:44.966
of course. they're
required by law !

12:45.034 --> 12:46.968
we said we wouldn't
let anyone hurt you,

12:47.036 --> 12:49.404
and we mean it.
come on.

12:55.478 --> 12:57.079
gun it, april !

13:00.883 --> 13:03.518
ah, look
at them run.

13:04.853 --> 13:07.689
activate confirmed
kill cannon.

13:07.756 --> 13:10.191
ready, aim...

13:15.699 --> 13:18.200
eat hot lead,
turkeys !

13:25.476 --> 13:26.976
slick driving, april.

13:27.044 --> 13:29.278
now take us alongside it.

13:32.182 --> 13:34.784
rip it up,
Leonardo.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.793
we'll take them
on foot.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.730
fancy shooting,
hepcats.

13:48.799 --> 13:51.000
let's go back
and eradicate them.

13:51.067 --> 13:53.969
uh-oh, cats and kittens,
you dig what i dig ?

13:55.639 --> 13:58.874
<i>find all those creatures
and take them down. </i>

13:58.942 --> 14:00.609
ah, some dirty rat
must've squealed

14:00.677 --> 14:02.511
to the coppers
about us. ah.

14:02.578 --> 14:04.680
don't those squares
you're on their side ?

14:04.748 --> 14:06.448
nah, humans
don't know nothin'

14:06.516 --> 14:08.051
when it comes
to turtles.

14:08.119 --> 14:09.720
april: ahem !

14:09.787 --> 14:12.889
uh, present
company excepted.

14:12.957 --> 14:14.391
has anyone stopped
to think

14:14.458 --> 14:16.226
why the Shredder
has a pipeline

14:16.294 --> 14:18.428
to an entirely
different dimension ?

14:18.496 --> 14:20.330
those stone warriors

14:20.398 --> 14:22.099
could just be
the beginning.

14:22.167 --> 14:24.234
we must consult with
master Splinter

14:24.302 --> 14:26.036
before taking
further action.

14:26.104 --> 14:27.938
neutrinos, follow us.

14:28.006 --> 14:30.040
sewers,
here we come.

14:39.483 --> 14:41.184
we must fight our way
through them

14:41.252 --> 14:43.086
and find the neutrinos.

14:43.154 --> 14:45.255
this weather satellite

14:45.323 --> 14:48.124
will take care of them
and the neutrinos.

14:48.193 --> 14:49.959
but we don't need
to know

14:50.027 --> 14:51.628
what the weather is.

14:51.696 --> 14:54.398
this doesn't report
weather, you idiot.

14:54.465 --> 14:56.132
it makes weather !

14:56.201 --> 14:58.436
it's Krang's old design.

15:03.108 --> 15:04.275
aha...

15:06.644 --> 15:09.347
within 2 hours,
the weather it creates

15:09.415 --> 15:12.350
will stamp
this city flat.

15:12.418 --> 15:14.051
to the technodrome !

15:29.701 --> 15:32.337
we must get back
to the technodrome.

15:32.404 --> 15:34.271
those neutrinos could
attack lord Krang

15:34.340 --> 15:35.373
at any moment !

15:35.441 --> 15:37.408
yes, and the weathermaker

15:37.476 --> 15:38.943
will soon
tear this place apart.

15:39.010 --> 15:42.580
let us commandeer
that ground vehicle.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.719
how do you engage
the hyperdrive on this thing ?

15:47.853 --> 15:50.588
cop on loudspeaker:
ok, you. out of the truck !

15:56.529 --> 15:59.364
cop: fire !

16:03.703 --> 16:06.639
the bullets
aren't stopping them !

16:06.706 --> 16:11.509
we must get to Krang
before those brats do.

16:13.346 --> 16:15.180
Splinter: so, tell us more

16:15.248 --> 16:17.315
about these stone warriors.

16:17.383 --> 16:19.918
they obey their leader--
a guy named Krang.

16:19.986 --> 16:21.987
who is this Krang ?

16:22.055 --> 16:24.022
the supreme warlord
of dimension x, man.

16:24.090 --> 16:26.091
only he got exiled
to another universe.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.593
and his body
got split, man.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.961
and now he's
just this way-out brain.

16:30.029 --> 16:31.930
you said you saw
some kind of brain

16:31.998 --> 16:33.064
when we were fighting

16:33.132 --> 16:34.566
the mousers yesterday,
Michelangelo.

16:34.634 --> 16:37.569
oh, you bet your
sweet shell i did.

16:37.637 --> 16:39.137
so that is where
the Shredder

16:39.205 --> 16:41.340
has been getting
his advanced technology

16:41.408 --> 16:44.310
to build a means back
to his home dimension.

16:44.377 --> 16:46.545
uh, how many of
those stone warriors

16:46.613 --> 16:48.815
does Krang have
in dimension x ?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.382
like, zillions, man.

16:50.450 --> 16:53.152
then he's
going bring them here

16:53.220 --> 16:55.154
and conquer
our universe.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.957
neutrinos, we have
got to stop Krang.

16:58.025 --> 16:59.993
turtles, we've gotta
help them do it.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.827
great. but how ?

17:01.896 --> 17:03.763
we find this freak
and push him

17:03.830 --> 17:05.830
through the portal
back to dimension x.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.566
don't worry, calla.

17:07.634 --> 17:09.935
we won't let anything
happen to you.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.675
all right !

17:15.742 --> 17:17.009
snow !

17:17.078 --> 17:20.079
yeah, but in the middle
of june ?

17:23.117 --> 17:26.219
uh, we certainly are
having a lot of weather.

17:26.286 --> 17:29.222
it's gotta be a stone warrior
weathermaker. look !

17:30.890 --> 17:32.526
let's haul tail over
to the technodrome

17:32.594 --> 17:34.928
before the monsoon
season starts.

17:43.271 --> 17:46.340
we'll never get
the van up there.

17:46.408 --> 17:48.208
april, stay here.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.943
oh, again ?!

17:55.817 --> 17:58.251
dig, cats,
the dimensional portal.

18:00.655 --> 18:02.823
Donatello,
try to figure out

18:02.891 --> 18:04.424
how to work
this thing.

18:04.492 --> 18:05.392
i'll cover you.

18:10.432 --> 18:13.167
just what we needed--
company.

18:13.234 --> 18:15.936
just what
you're gonna get-

18:16.004 --> 18:18.071
a pounding.

18:19.341 --> 18:21.475
i'm getting some way-out
life readings ahead.

18:26.649 --> 18:28.182
there he is !

18:28.250 --> 18:30.585
he's the brains
of this operation !

18:39.828 --> 18:41.663
can you
hold them off ?

18:41.730 --> 18:42.963
there's only 8 of them.

18:45.867 --> 18:48.469
got you, shell-brain.

18:48.537 --> 18:49.804
uhh !

18:49.871 --> 18:52.940
now let's see
what this does.

18:53.008 --> 18:56.978
you little creep !

18:58.414 --> 18:59.714
cowabunga !

19:06.222 --> 19:08.089
it's no good !
we'll never get Krang

19:08.156 --> 19:09.424
past that force field.

19:09.491 --> 19:11.659
we better scram.

19:11.727 --> 19:13.829
excellent work,
traag.

19:13.896 --> 19:15.897
i'm going to pin
a medal on you

19:15.965 --> 19:18.667
as soon as i get
a pair of hands.

19:18.735 --> 19:21.204
let's take them,
Leonardo.

19:25.875 --> 19:28.644
the dimensional portal
is open.

19:28.711 --> 19:31.914
great ! now to get those
rockheads in there.

19:34.017 --> 19:35.885
huh. uhh !

19:35.952 --> 19:38.688
Michelangelo,
there's a barrel

19:38.755 --> 19:40.289
of silicone lubricant
over there.

19:40.356 --> 19:42.558
use it to give them
the slip.

19:42.626 --> 19:44.827
cowabunga !

19:58.041 --> 20:00.876
ok, neutrinos,
it's your turn.

20:00.944 --> 20:03.312
b-but we want
to stay with you

20:03.379 --> 20:04.647
and have fun !

20:04.715 --> 20:06.717
i can't hold this thing
open forever.

20:06.784 --> 20:08.819
and it's your
only ticket home.

20:08.886 --> 20:10.520
he's right.
we can't stay here.

20:10.588 --> 20:11.855
and we've got to
carry on the fight

20:11.922 --> 20:14.458
against Krang
in dimension x.

20:14.525 --> 20:16.460
good-bye,
you crazy turtles.

20:16.527 --> 20:18.228
we'll miss you.

20:20.765 --> 20:22.699
we'll miss you, too.

20:22.766 --> 20:24.568
ok, Shredder.

20:24.635 --> 20:27.204
this is it !

20:29.307 --> 20:31.041
uh, on second
thought...

20:31.108 --> 20:32.876
the weathermaker.

20:32.943 --> 20:34.477
we must head up
and stop it.

20:34.545 --> 20:36.313
after we stop
the Shredder.

20:36.380 --> 20:39.682
that crummy coward.
he split.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.718
worry about it later.
we gotta save the city.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.090
that thing'll blow
this whole city

20:47.158 --> 20:50.026
clear to oz
unless we stop it.

20:52.129 --> 20:53.096
there it is.

20:58.203 --> 21:01.205
i can't get
a clear shot.

21:01.272 --> 21:02.707
i'll handle it.

21:02.774 --> 21:04.141
Leonardo !

21:09.381 --> 21:10.781
nab him !

21:13.785 --> 21:16.521
way to go,
Leonardo.

21:16.588 --> 21:17.921
yeah.

21:17.989 --> 21:19.524
everybody complains
about the weather,

21:19.591 --> 21:22.260
but you actually did
something about it.

21:22.327 --> 21:23.894
all right, Krang.

21:23.962 --> 21:25.329
the turtles
must be stopped,

21:25.397 --> 21:26.864
whatever it takes,

21:26.932 --> 21:30.501
so i shall complete
your new body.

21:30.568 --> 21:33.237
you must destroy them
for me !

21:33.305 --> 21:35.072
i'm glad to see

21:35.139 --> 21:38.075
you've finally
come to your senses.

21:42.581 --> 21:44.248
"and, as he crossed
the finish line,

21:44.315 --> 21:45.549
"the tortoise realized

21:45.617 --> 21:47.753
"that slow and steady
does win the race.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.588
for he had beaten the hare. "

21:49.655 --> 21:52.557
mmm. i love
that story.

21:52.625 --> 21:55.427
oh, read it
again, april.

21:55.495 --> 21:57.829
but i've read it
5 times.

21:57.897 --> 22:00.199
oh, just once more.

22:05.404 --> 22:08.207
just a bunch
of sleepyheads.

22:08.274 --> 22:09.808
they'll need
their rest

22:09.876 --> 22:11.043
because tomorrow

22:11.111 --> 22:12.711
we're going to find
the Shredder

22:12.779 --> 22:14.512
and finish him.
