00:23.976 --> 00:26.767
(shower running)

00:34.125 --> 00:36.583
[Woman] The key to
being a good mistress,

00:36.667 --> 00:39.208
is to always having
you wanting me,

00:39.291 --> 00:40.458
more than I want you.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.583
It's about the effort
I'm willing to make,

00:43.667 --> 00:46.500
when the other person who's
at home doesn't anymore.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.917
I like making you feel
like the priority.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.458
I'm independent,
financially stable,

00:54.542 --> 00:57.041
and will never be a burden
to you or your family.

00:57.881 --> 00:59.917
My days aren't
filled thinking about

01:00.000 --> 01:01.917
how to make our
relationship work,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.041
how to keep the spark,

01:04.125 --> 01:06.250
or what I need to do to
keep you on the hook.

01:07.417 --> 01:08.959
Of course, there are rules.

01:10.041 --> 01:12.667
Don't put me in situations
that might be risky.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.625
I don't want the accidental
run-ins with your friends,

01:15.709 --> 01:19.625
or to be taken to a restaurant
you go to with your wife.

01:20.822 --> 01:22.750
I don't want to be on the radar.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.709
I'm willing to live
in the shadows,

01:24.792 --> 01:26.250
and I prefer it that way.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.030
I won't be your first phone call

01:29.041 --> 01:30.583
when you and your
wife have a fight.

01:30.667 --> 01:34.500
You have friends for that,
and I am not your backup plan.

01:34.583 --> 01:36.208
Yes, I'm your friend.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.458
I'm happy to listen
and discuss the things

01:38.542 --> 01:40.390
that are important to you,

01:40.414 --> 01:42.573
but I'm not interested in
hearing about the issues

01:42.583 --> 01:44.543
you and your wife deal
with on a day-to-day basis.

01:47.111 --> 01:48.830
When all is said and done,

01:48.896 --> 01:51.500
my hope is that I'm
out of the picture,

01:51.583 --> 01:54.560
and you and your wife will
live happily ever after.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.500
The time we spend
together is our time,

01:58.583 --> 02:00.750
but when we're separate,
we're separate.

02:00.834 --> 02:03.333
You have your life
and I have mine.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.205
I'm the only one, there
will be no others.

02:07.216 --> 02:11.000
There will be no expensive
gifts or money exchanged.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.709
We don't do holidays.

02:12.792 --> 02:13.834
As far as I'm concerned,

02:13.917 --> 02:16.500
Christmas should be
celebrated with your family,

02:16.583 --> 02:17.583
not with me.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.641
But the most important
rule of them all,

02:25.166 --> 02:26.709
I am not your possession.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.407
So you'll treat me, and my time,

02:30.979 --> 02:32.104
with respect.

02:38.432 --> 02:41.599
Have I told you how
incredible you look tonight?

02:41.792 --> 02:43.750
You have Nathan,
thank you again.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.125
So, the last time
we were together,

02:47.208 --> 02:49.583
I was telling you about that
deal, the Jamison Merger?

02:49.667 --> 02:51.083
Oh yes, that's right.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.417
Veronica,

02:52.500 --> 02:53.667
I closed it.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.291
Congratulations.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.250
That one was not easy,

02:57.333 --> 02:58.500
but if everything pans out

02:58.583 --> 03:00.709
we'll be opening offices
in Tokyo come August.

03:00.792 --> 03:01.792
Fantastic.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.484
Don't worry, I'll only
be gone a couple of weeks.

03:05.495 --> 03:06.543
(phone buzzing)

03:06.554 --> 03:07.554
Sorry.

03:12.085 --> 03:13.527
What if it's important?

03:13.538 --> 03:14.620
You should take that.

03:14.631 --> 03:16.191
She can wait.

03:16.202 --> 03:19.041
Nathan, you're not
where she thinks you are.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.655
You should answer it.

03:20.666 --> 03:21.671
If I answer that here,

03:21.682 --> 03:24.222
she'll know I'm not
where I'm supposed to be.

03:24.233 --> 03:26.989
Then why don't you go
outside and call her?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Now, go on.

03:31.884 --> 03:34.553
Order us another bottle,
I'll be right back.

03:39.967 --> 03:42.208
Look I told you I
couldn't be interrupted

03:42.291 --> 03:44.375
while I was meeting
with these investors.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.458
What's up?

03:47.523 --> 03:49.356
Say again?

03:49.367 --> 03:50.825
You what?

03:56.130 --> 03:58.005
[Veronica] Is everything okay?

03:58.166 --> 03:59.166
I have to go.

04:00.224 --> 04:01.640
Why Nathan?

04:01.651 --> 04:03.817
I'm sorry we didn't get
to have dinner together,

04:03.828 --> 04:06.350
but at least we got
to share some wine.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.875
I took care of the bill.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.663
I'll call you tomorrow.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.500
(soft jazz piano)

04:18.333 --> 04:20.375
(doorbell ringing)

04:22.208 --> 04:23.667
Hi, Ian.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.333
Wow, Veronica, you look amazing.

04:26.417 --> 04:29.625
Oh you're so sweet,
how much do I owe you?

04:29.709 --> 04:32.387
Uh it's gonna be $17.63.

04:32.583 --> 04:33.917
Keep the change.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.042
Thanks.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.417
So did you just get
dressed up for me,

04:38.500 --> 04:40.207
or what's the occasion?

04:40.218 --> 04:42.008
No occasion.

04:42.019 --> 04:43.782
My evening just ended early.

04:43.793 --> 04:44.845
If I was taking you out,

04:44.856 --> 04:47.064
the evening wouldn't end early.

04:47.291 --> 04:50.041
You know I'm old
enough to be your mother?

04:50.125 --> 04:51.333
So?

04:51.417 --> 04:53.500
I live enough on
the edge as it is, go.

04:55.917 --> 04:56.917
Bye Veronica.

05:00.359 --> 05:02.734
[Man On TV] <i>Gonna have
a talk with the President.</i>

05:02.959 --> 05:05.375
[Man On TV] <i>Oh, telling
him we're gonna rob him?</i>

05:05.458 --> 05:06.542
<i>Not a good idea, man.</i>

05:43.125 --> 05:46.583
(phone ringing)

05:48.756 --> 05:50.072
Ronnie, can you get that?

05:50.083 --> 05:50.792
(phone ringing)

05:50.875 --> 05:52.208
Just coming.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.834
Bookaneer, can I help you?

05:58.192 --> 05:59.850
Oh, hi Margie.

06:01.255 --> 06:03.255
Oh, let me ask Trent,
hold on one sec.

06:03.417 --> 06:04.125
Trent?

06:04.208 --> 06:05.991
Did Margie's order come in yet?

06:06.002 --> 06:08.639
Just, it's in the drawer
with her name on it.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.343
Yep, it's right here.

06:14.667 --> 06:19.835
Uh, no no, you can come in
tomorrow anytime after 10.

06:19.846 --> 06:20.513
No, no no.

06:20.524 --> 06:22.856
Right, bye bye.

06:24.129 --> 06:25.836
No no no no no,
you call her back.

06:25.847 --> 06:27.138
Why?

06:27.166 --> 06:28.365
You're meeting Adam tomorrow

06:28.375 --> 06:30.250
at the Summerland
Estate at 11 o'clock.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.458
You can handle Margie.

06:31.542 --> 06:34.166
Just because I can,
doesn't mean I want to.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.000
I know.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.458
You do know, don't you?

06:36.542 --> 06:38.333
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?

06:38.934 --> 06:39.959
She's fun.

06:40.041 --> 06:41.581
She's awful.

06:41.592 --> 06:44.471
I'm not even in the front door, and
you two are making fun of my outfit.

06:44.482 --> 06:45.250
Hi, hon.

06:45.261 --> 06:46.072
Hey Brandon.

06:46.083 --> 06:46.987
What did I miss?

06:46.998 --> 06:49.849
I'll fill you in at lunch, I'm
just gonna go get my purse.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.625
Great, now we can charge double.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.238
I'll make sure Ronnie
gets a couple of more copies

07:01.248 --> 07:02.406
for you guys next week.

07:02.417 --> 07:05.166
What we really need, is for
you to do an in-store signing,

07:05.177 --> 07:07.061
it would really
liven up the joint.

07:07.072 --> 07:08.675
It's not my thing.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.041
Could be.

07:10.851 --> 07:12.542
Ready.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.212
So, am I losing you for
the rest of the afternoon?

07:15.223 --> 07:17.583
You're not gonna close
up early again, are you?

07:17.667 --> 07:19.917
That happened once,
and it was an emergency.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.166
No, I wanted to show
you my new routine.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.667
Oh, we certainly
can't miss that.

07:23.750 --> 07:26.500
Honey, I'm gonna be
there, later tonight.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.009
It's okay Trent,
I'll have her back

07:28.020 --> 07:29.239
in a couple of hours.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.834
Don't forget my doggie bag.

07:30.917 --> 07:31.792
(bell ringing)

07:31.875 --> 07:32.875
Woof.

07:37.461 --> 07:38.461
Woof.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.625
So, how was your date?

07:41.709 --> 07:43.125
He left before dinner.

07:43.918 --> 07:45.751
Oh, how are we
feeling about this?

07:46.100 --> 07:48.633
It's conflicted, you know.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.719
I know I ought to feel
mad, but I don't and,

07:51.730 --> 07:54.564
feel a little bit
jealous, and I shouldn't.

07:54.714 --> 07:56.823
Jealous about what, exactly?

07:58.709 --> 08:01.166
About my place, and
list of priorities.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.166
I get that.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.792
But he is married.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.542
I know, and I accept
that but sometimes

08:07.625 --> 08:10.252
it's harder than
others to understand.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.514
So you like this guy?

08:14.168 --> 08:16.698
As much as I like any
of the guys I go out with.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.375
So, not enough.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.584
What's that supposed to mean?

08:21.083 --> 08:24.186
Am I supposed to want to
break up their marriage?

08:25.500 --> 08:26.709
I want you to care enough

08:26.792 --> 08:29.208
that you'd want them
to only be with you.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.959
Is that what you would've
liked when we were dating?

08:33.008 --> 08:35.364
Well, I would have been
the cause of your divorce,

08:35.375 --> 08:38.375
and then we couldn't be the
friends that we are right now.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.384
You didn't cause my divorce.

08:40.808 --> 08:42.143
My marriage did.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.917
Hey, my grandnephew's
birthday's next week.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.680
Can you help me pick
out a present for him?

08:50.750 --> 08:52.353
Great, how old is he?

08:53.959 --> 08:55.375
Seven, I think.

08:58.521 --> 09:00.961
No, I'm sorry that
title's out of print.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.598
Yeah, even in paperback.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.401
Out of print, is out of print.

09:04.412 --> 09:05.456
(bell ringing)

09:05.467 --> 09:07.409
Okay, oh gotta go.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.398
All right, thank you.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.583
Ho ho ho.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.640
Beg, beg.

09:13.959 --> 09:17.125
Ah, Portofino Italian
Bistro, my favorite.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.208
Thank you.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.375
Thanks for lunch.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.792
My pleasure.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.834
Thanks for helping me
pick out a gift for Bobby.

09:24.750 --> 09:25.959
Movie tonight?

09:26.041 --> 09:28.015
[Trent] Ronnie, my
showcase is tonight.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.137
I guess that answers that,
do you want to join us?

09:30.148 --> 09:31.698
I have to take a rain check.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.375
Sure.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.338
Hey, I'm going up the
coast to San Luis Obispo

09:35.375 --> 09:37.120
to scout for my new book.

09:37.792 --> 09:38.792
Wanna go?

09:38.875 --> 09:40.115
I love our trips, yeah, I'm in.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.458
Great.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.750
(phone notification)

09:47.562 --> 09:48.546
What?

09:48.557 --> 09:49.445
Nothing.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.456
Okay.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.625
What?

09:52.636 --> 09:53.882
Nothing.

09:53.937 --> 09:55.823
Have fun tonight.

09:55.834 --> 09:56.834
Bye.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.146
What?

10:00.157 --> 10:02.825
Nothing, go, do,
I'll see you later.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.166
(bell ringing)

10:06.250 --> 10:09.250
(soft piano music)

10:47.959 --> 10:49.542
I'm glad you
could make it today.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.901
Thank you for arranging this.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.407
The vultures will
pillage everything

10:53.417 --> 10:55.375
but the paint from the
walls when they arrive.

10:56.130 --> 10:59.255
But you get carte blanche.

11:05.993 --> 11:07.244
In here.

11:07.476 --> 11:09.017
Why?

11:09.117 --> 11:11.827
You know how I always
take care of you.

11:15.134 --> 11:17.051
Love is a smoke

11:17.166 --> 11:19.041
raised with the fume of sighs,

11:20.323 --> 11:23.740
being purged, the fires
sparkling in lovers' eyes.

11:24.910 --> 11:29.082
Being vexed, a scene
nourished with lovers' tears.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.583
What is it else?

11:31.166 --> 11:33.208
A madness most discreet.

11:34.002 --> 11:35.128
A choking gall.

11:35.171 --> 11:36.546
And a preserving sweet.

11:38.884 --> 11:39.884
You know this?

11:40.750 --> 11:42.851
Of course, Romeo and Juliet.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.913
The forbidden lovers.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.710
Have a drink with me tonight.

11:52.437 --> 11:55.578
Adam, you're married,
and I'm seeing someone.

11:57.523 --> 12:00.041
You know I'll keep
asking until you say yes.

12:00.125 --> 12:01.625
And history has proven that.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.182
Well, points for persistence.

12:06.117 --> 12:08.242
Help me, I want to get
these to the store.

12:15.347 --> 12:17.750
Oh Ronnie, we really
hit the jackpot here.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.433
Tell me about it.

12:20.554 --> 12:23.096
(bell ringing)

12:24.500 --> 12:25.792
Hi Margie.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.291
Good day, my dear.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.750
Hello Trent.

12:28.834 --> 12:29.834
Hello.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.817
There you go.

12:32.864 --> 12:33.947
It's for my grandson.

12:33.958 --> 12:36.667
Oh, it's very mature reading.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.630
Well, Lord knows I don't
want him falling prey

12:38.709 --> 12:41.166
to the liberal down slide.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.597
What is he, eight?

12:42.608 --> 12:45.816
Yes, a very impressionable age.

12:45.827 --> 12:47.369
So, what do I owe you?

12:47.380 --> 12:49.546
45 dollars and 87 cents please.

12:51.094 --> 12:54.719
I have exact change.

12:55.013 --> 12:56.432
Of course you do.

12:57.817 --> 12:59.026
Here it is.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.083
Now, when are you
getting married?

13:02.166 --> 13:06.333
Ah, well just as soon as
I find Mister Right, Margie.

13:06.417 --> 13:07.421
When you stop looking,

13:07.432 --> 13:09.030
that's when you're
going to find him.

13:09.041 --> 13:11.667
You know I met Harold
when I was on a train trip

13:11.750 --> 13:14.250
in Europe with my sister, Edna.

13:14.929 --> 13:16.875
Oh, that is so romantic.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.875
I met my Steve on a train.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.250
We got married last month.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.125
Thank you for the book, dear.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.125
(bell ringing)

13:28.208 --> 13:29.625
Really? On a train?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.375
I couldn't resist.

13:31.386 --> 13:33.699
Plus, telling a dinosaur that
you met your husband online,

13:33.709 --> 13:35.458
doesn't have quite
the same effect.

13:35.542 --> 13:37.789
Now, speaking of which,

13:37.800 --> 13:39.959
can I create an online
dating profile for you?

13:40.041 --> 13:41.333
I don't trust people online.

13:41.956 --> 13:45.333
They lie, and they'll say
anything to get you to meet them,

13:45.417 --> 13:47.125
and then when you do,

13:47.208 --> 13:48.714
it's a big disappointment.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.461
You ever tried it?

13:50.472 --> 13:51.834
I don't need to.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.375
I've seen 20/20.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.133
Hold a sec, you and
Brandon have a history.

13:56.144 --> 13:56.816
Yeah.

13:56.827 --> 13:58.130
Well, he's single now,

13:58.141 --> 13:59.607
and you're kind of whatever,

13:59.618 --> 14:01.439
so why don't you guys pick
up where you left off?

14:01.449 --> 14:03.783
I don't want a relationship.

14:04.625 --> 14:05.709
I'm happy.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.745
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

14:08.756 --> 14:10.625
You are in a
relationship, with Brandon,

14:10.709 --> 14:13.014
you just don't see it.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.542
You guys go to concerts
and movies together,

14:16.625 --> 14:19.704
you do lunches and dinners,
you're practically best friends,

14:19.715 --> 14:21.514
you're just not having sex.

14:22.291 --> 14:25.139
Oh, um,

14:25.375 --> 14:26.959
was he bad in bed?

14:27.041 --> 14:28.959
(tribal drumming)

14:38.798 --> 14:40.009
So, great in bed,

14:40.020 --> 14:42.611
and a dear friend,

14:42.917 --> 14:44.542
what's the problem?

14:44.625 --> 14:47.264
Well, he's never shown any
interest in being with me.

14:47.275 --> 14:48.834
I don't think that's true.

14:48.917 --> 14:50.208
The entire time I've known him,

14:50.291 --> 14:52.125
we've only been together once,

14:52.208 --> 14:54.908
at his house, and he
was still married.

14:54.955 --> 14:57.125
(phone ringing)

14:57.208 --> 14:58.490
That's my wife.

14:58.501 --> 14:59.531
I know it, don't move.

14:59.542 --> 15:00.642
Don't say a word.

15:00.653 --> 15:04.444
Wait until I'm out of
bed before you answer that.

15:09.375 --> 15:09.750
Hello?

15:09.834 --> 15:10.954
[Wife] Hi.

15:11.051 --> 15:12.117
Hey hon.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.615
[Wife] Guess who
caught an early train.

15:13.625 --> 15:14.792
I need you to pick me up.

15:14.875 --> 15:15.792
Where are you?

15:15.875 --> 15:18.019
[Wife] In town at the station.

15:18.030 --> 15:20.113
I love that.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.836
All right, I'll be there in 20.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.125
You went to his house?

15:27.208 --> 15:28.542
That's not like you.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.000
Well, I wasn't as
careful then as I am now.

15:31.011 --> 15:33.428
(rock music)

15:42.959 --> 15:45.590
(phone ringing)

15:45.609 --> 15:46.359
Hello?

15:46.380 --> 15:47.872
I left my earrings there.

15:47.883 --> 15:49.754
Okay, where'd you put them?

15:49.778 --> 15:52.856
They're on the nightstand
on your side of the bed.

15:53.064 --> 15:53.989
Okay, I got 'em.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.317
What do I do with these?

15:55.328 --> 15:56.740
Do you have a place
you can hide them?

15:56.750 --> 15:58.394
Just give them to me
when I see you again.

15:58.405 --> 16:00.322
When Rachel comes home
from a trip, she nests.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.834
She goes through things
and reorganizes everything.

16:02.917 --> 16:03.917
All right.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.528
Do you have a gift box?

16:11.583 --> 16:13.375
Yeah, I got one.

16:13.981 --> 16:14.981
And a ribbon?

16:16.845 --> 16:17.961
I got a bow.

16:17.972 --> 16:19.618
Well, if that's all
you've got, then sure.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.041
Hey what am I doing with these?

16:21.125 --> 16:23.041
Put the earrings in the box.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.155
Wait, am I giving your
earrings to my wife as a gift?

16:26.166 --> 16:27.916
And tell her you
were thinking about her

16:27.927 --> 16:29.437
while she was gone.

16:30.838 --> 16:32.713
That's probably gonna work.

16:32.724 --> 16:33.932
You're the best.

16:34.096 --> 16:35.096
Are we good?

16:35.959 --> 16:36.959
Take a breath.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.458
Go get her.

16:42.417 --> 16:45.121
Lucky for him they
were my good earrings.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.291
So that's why you don't
go to their houses anymore?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.959
Well, that's just one reason.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.453
(bell ringing)

16:51.464 --> 16:53.870
I have a delivery
for Veronica Malloy.

16:54.792 --> 16:55.917
Who are they from?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.041
Card's inside, sign here please.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.125
Okay.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.012
Thank you.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.709
Hmm, beautiful.

17:12.415 --> 17:14.832
Here, for Steve.

17:15.789 --> 17:16.973
What, no likey?

17:16.992 --> 17:19.406
Oh, they should be with somebody
who can actually enjoy them.

17:19.416 --> 17:20.750
Okay, thanks, but

17:20.834 --> 17:22.458
why aren't you enjoying them?

17:22.541 --> 17:26.541
Because they cause more problems
than they actually solve.

17:26.625 --> 17:27.625
Trust me.

17:29.834 --> 17:32.875
(soft piano music)

17:44.709 --> 17:47.896
Veronica, can I get you
anything else this evening?

17:47.959 --> 17:50.005
What about a creme brulee?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.777
What's the occasion?

17:52.166 --> 17:53.497
Just because.

17:53.669 --> 17:54.959
Coming right up.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.125
Thank you.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.250
Hey sweetie.

18:07.112 --> 18:08.607
Oh baby.

18:09.792 --> 18:11.041
And what is for dinner?

18:11.125 --> 18:12.500
Smells fantastic.

18:13.417 --> 18:16.583
My newest creation,
mondiale amore.

18:17.182 --> 18:18.806
Okay.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.542
Oh honey, that is delicious.

18:21.553 --> 18:23.156
Yeah, I'm gonna put
it on the fall menu,

18:23.166 --> 18:25.354
I think the owners
are gonna love it.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.531
Well they are
crazy if they don't.

18:29.505 --> 18:33.177
Oh there's what you got for me.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.502
Geez, must have
cost you a fortune.

18:37.513 --> 18:39.692
Actually, it's a re-gift.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.906
One of Veronica's suitors is
trying to buy her affections.

18:44.677 --> 18:45.790
How is our girl?

18:45.801 --> 18:46.982
She's fine.

18:46.993 --> 18:49.277
Oh and by the way, the loved
the pastries you sent over.

18:49.288 --> 18:52.373
Of course she did, they
were wonderful pastries.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.280
Actually, I'm a little
concerned about her.

18:56.291 --> 18:57.291
Here, wine.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.302
Yes.

18:58.959 --> 19:01.542
I want her to have what we have.

19:01.625 --> 19:04.151
But if she continues down
the road that she's on,

19:04.162 --> 19:05.333
she's never gonna find it.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.375
You need to be a
supportive friend,

19:07.458 --> 19:10.795
and leave her alone, she
needs to find her own way.

19:10.873 --> 19:13.561
But why can't she and
Brandon be together?

19:13.572 --> 19:15.840
Come on, they're
perfect, they fit.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.333
Don't meddle.

19:17.877 --> 19:19.416
Go get washed up.

19:19.515 --> 19:21.848
Dinner is almost ready.

19:21.971 --> 19:24.962
Oh and take down the
sling, it's getting dusty.

19:24.973 --> 19:27.642
[Trent] I told my
mom it's a hammock.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.127
You're kidding.

19:34.333 --> 19:36.083
I'm not going to Tokyo.

19:37.848 --> 19:39.905
I'm sorry, did the
deal fall through?

19:39.916 --> 19:41.987
No, everything's
still on course,

19:41.998 --> 19:45.457
but there are more pressing
issues here at home.

19:48.122 --> 19:50.623
Andrea lost her job last week.

19:51.041 --> 19:54.748
She's devastated, and I want
to be there for her right now.

19:55.001 --> 19:57.460
It's not like we
need the money but,

19:57.583 --> 20:00.385
this is something that
was important to her.

20:06.545 --> 20:07.963
You know when we first met

20:08.041 --> 20:09.481
you said you had to
be there for her,

20:10.307 --> 20:12.307
and now you want to be there.

20:12.318 --> 20:13.775
It's nice to hear.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.479
I hope this isn't goodbye.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.625
Nathan, it would make me happy

20:18.709 --> 20:20.564
if I never heard from you again.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.603
Gee, thanks.

20:22.814 --> 20:24.364
Honey, if I do it
means that there's

20:24.375 --> 20:27.375
something wrong in your marriage,
and you're not fixing it.

20:28.876 --> 20:31.971
Affairs are like drugs,
they can become addictive.

20:32.458 --> 20:33.783
But at the base,

20:34.710 --> 20:36.572
you're just using it
to escape problems

20:36.583 --> 20:38.486
that you don't want to face.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.500
I will miss you.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
Be happy.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.417
(solemn piano music)

20:57.445 --> 21:01.458
So, Steve introduced me
to something new last night.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.875
Trent, we've already
discussed oversharing.

21:03.959 --> 21:05.242
New recipe.

21:05.257 --> 21:07.291
Oh, is it good?

21:07.375 --> 21:08.792
Ah, to die for.

21:08.875 --> 21:11.387
I'm telling you, that
man can really cook.

21:11.398 --> 21:13.166
(bell ringing)

21:13.250 --> 21:15.859
Oh, good morning Adam.

21:16.166 --> 21:17.734
Still straight, Trent.

21:17.802 --> 21:18.968
Still married.

21:20.215 --> 21:21.280
For you.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.500
Thank you.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.943
Oh, and I've got
something for you.

21:28.917 --> 21:29.917
Thank you.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.855
Well, I guess I'll see
you at the next sale?

21:34.435 --> 21:35.660
Wait a second.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.430
Aren't you forgetting something?

21:37.441 --> 21:39.041
What's that?

21:39.125 --> 21:40.709
You made me a promise.

21:40.792 --> 21:41.792
Did I?

21:42.891 --> 21:44.682
Really?

21:44.984 --> 21:45.984
Remind me.

21:46.008 --> 21:47.924
Well, if I have to remind you,

21:48.125 --> 21:50.542
clearly it's not that
important to you.

21:50.625 --> 21:51.743
I guess you're right.

21:51.754 --> 21:52.868
About what?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.918
We met over a year ago,

21:54.929 --> 21:57.038
and I've been ridiculous so,

21:57.049 --> 21:58.674
I don't want to
bother you anymore.

21:58.959 --> 22:00.460
So?

22:00.788 --> 22:03.333
So, I give up.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.615
Well I guess I
won't be seeing you

22:05.625 --> 22:07.661
for drinks later tonight.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.667
Okay, and I guess
I won't see you

22:10.750 --> 22:13.542
at that bar at 5th
and Elm at eight.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.834
Hey, I'm not standing
up here for my health.

22:16.979 --> 22:18.479
Oh I'm sorry.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.625
See you later.

22:22.709 --> 22:23.792
You know it.

22:28.192 --> 22:31.317
Ronnie, you just went through
a breakup two hours ago.

22:31.378 --> 22:34.253
Don't you think you need
a little time to heal?

22:34.500 --> 22:35.785
Heal from what?

22:36.158 --> 22:38.322
My relationships always
have an expiration date.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.500
It's a matter of when, not if.

22:42.661 --> 22:45.629
And you don't see
anything wrong with that?

22:47.241 --> 22:49.158
Okay, you know what
your problem is?

22:49.169 --> 22:51.961
You're emotionally
claustrophobic.

22:52.088 --> 22:54.464
Look, I'm not looking
for a relationship.

22:55.302 --> 22:57.489
Lord knows the drama
that comes with one,

22:57.500 --> 22:59.949
I have right here with you.

23:00.198 --> 23:01.198
Oh, okay.

23:04.876 --> 23:07.377
(somber orchestral music)

23:42.599 --> 23:44.390
Gorgeous.

23:44.636 --> 23:46.542
Thank you.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.792
Sorry I'm late, life.

23:49.753 --> 23:51.333
Excuse me, sir.

23:51.417 --> 23:52.417
Scotch neat, please.

23:54.814 --> 23:56.439
So, tell me,

23:57.417 --> 23:59.345
what changed your mind?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.103
I wasn't available until now.

24:04.183 --> 24:05.183
Oh, I see.

24:05.959 --> 24:09.083
Well I'm sorry it
didn't work out.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.614
That's the last lie you're
ever going to tell me.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.543
Thank you.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.254
(phone notification)

24:16.754 --> 24:18.000
Excuse me.

24:18.489 --> 24:19.489
Sure.

24:29.752 --> 24:33.035
Are you okay with the
fact that I'm not yours,

24:33.055 --> 24:34.567
and I never will be.

24:34.834 --> 24:37.917
I know my place and
I'm comfortable with it.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Else, I wouldn't be here.

24:40.619 --> 24:42.231
Cheers?

24:42.799 --> 24:43.799
Cheers.

24:48.875 --> 24:51.231
Are you seeing anyone else?

24:51.903 --> 24:53.570
Aside from my wife?

24:53.834 --> 24:54.834
No.

24:55.837 --> 24:57.478
Let me lay it out for you now.

24:57.489 --> 24:59.115
Do, please.

25:00.078 --> 25:02.535
I have been mad about
you since the day we met,

25:02.546 --> 25:04.671
and I can't stop
thinking about you.

25:05.617 --> 25:07.451
I'm not leaving my wife.

25:08.833 --> 25:10.958
But I have to be with you.

25:12.004 --> 25:15.171
(romantic piano music)

26:32.351 --> 26:34.947
You are very quiet this morning.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.939
I just wish someone knew
how I really want it to be.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.375
Do tell.

26:42.164 --> 26:44.916
Well, I know it
sounds selfish but,

26:46.250 --> 26:47.530
there are times
when I wish a guy

26:47.583 --> 26:48.875
would pay attention to my needs

26:48.959 --> 26:51.392
as much as he pays
attention to his.

26:52.809 --> 26:54.663
So, safe to say that Adam

26:54.674 --> 26:57.319
will only be filling
our shelves from now on.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.260
No, I don't know about that.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.500
Look, what you need,

27:01.583 --> 27:04.291
is a guy that isn't
splitting his focus,

27:05.179 --> 27:06.679
like Brandon.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.000
Trent, you know me,

27:09.083 --> 27:12.650
as soon as I get into a
relationship I push them away.

27:12.661 --> 27:15.056
It's how I'm wired,
it's who I am.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.864
And I don't want to
do that to Brandon.

27:17.875 --> 27:19.375
Well if Brandon is any evidence

27:19.458 --> 27:20.667
of how you push people away,

27:20.750 --> 27:24.041
then you my dear
are very bad at it.

27:24.125 --> 27:26.500
I tried, he just wouldn't leave.

27:27.875 --> 27:30.076
He just stuck in there and,

27:31.607 --> 27:33.927
I've grown to love
our friendship.

27:35.169 --> 27:38.250
But that was him, it's all him.

27:38.333 --> 27:41.417
So I guess we are
back to square one.

27:50.125 --> 27:52.458
(rock music)

27:56.171 --> 27:58.796
Well, can we see this
when we're up there?

28:00.062 --> 28:01.931
Oh, butterflies.

28:03.717 --> 28:05.736
It's gonna add a couple
hours to our trip.

28:05.747 --> 28:07.845
I'm not in any
hurry to get back.

28:09.023 --> 28:10.398

30:41.651 --> 30:42.651
Hi.

30:43.336 --> 30:44.836
Hi, sleepy head.

30:46.591 --> 30:47.798
Where are we?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.057
Come on, I'll show you.

30:54.166 --> 30:58.000
(gentle piano and flute music)

31:04.679 --> 31:07.137
Oh my God, the butterflies.

31:08.511 --> 31:09.511
Thank you.

31:11.156 --> 31:13.155
Now I feel bad about
falling asleep.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.120
I wanted to surprise you.

31:18.612 --> 31:21.041
I wonder how many
butterflies come here.

31:21.125 --> 31:22.458
I don't know about that,

31:22.542 --> 31:25.706
but at least 100,000
humans come here each year.

31:26.583 --> 31:28.253
This is unbelievable.

31:28.401 --> 31:30.628
Did you know that
these butterflies

31:30.661 --> 31:33.253
have a lifespan of six months,

31:33.264 --> 31:36.765
whereas the common monarch
only lives for six weeks.

31:39.017 --> 31:40.017
Wow.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.765
Say cheese.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.120
Cheese.

31:49.672 --> 31:50.672
Oh it's pretty.

31:51.914 --> 31:52.914
Wow.

32:11.674 --> 32:14.250
Hey, your clothes,
can we move them?

32:14.261 --> 32:15.261
That's my bed.

32:16.004 --> 32:17.296
Sorry.

32:17.583 --> 32:18.834
Hey, you hungry?

32:18.917 --> 32:19.901
Yeah, I could eat.

32:19.912 --> 32:20.537
You want to go out or you want
to get something delivered?

32:20.548 --> 32:21.369
Let's order something in,

32:21.435 --> 32:23.721
then we can watch a movie on TV.

32:24.583 --> 32:25.874
Oh, that's a good idea.

32:25.885 --> 32:28.000
I'm sure there's a
pizza place close by.

32:28.083 --> 32:29.321
God, not pizza.

32:29.332 --> 32:31.416
You love pizza.

32:31.869 --> 32:33.744
I've eaten a lot lately.

32:35.606 --> 32:36.606
Okay well,

32:37.445 --> 32:40.094
I guess that only
leaves us one option.

32:56.861 --> 32:58.320
Dinner is served.

33:00.624 --> 33:03.115
And don't say anything, you
wanted to see the butterflies,

33:03.125 --> 33:04.708
so that's what you get.

33:05.062 --> 33:06.900
Otherwise you would
have been home by now.

33:06.911 --> 33:08.447
Well, it was worth it.

33:08.458 --> 33:09.782
I know you're
used to fine cuisine

33:09.792 --> 33:11.885
at five-star hotels,

33:11.896 --> 33:14.166
but this is as good
as it's gonna get.

33:14.177 --> 33:15.177
What do you got there?

33:15.188 --> 33:16.429
Rollos?

33:16.440 --> 33:17.856
Maybe.

33:20.417 --> 33:21.417
Okay, catch.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.667
Thanks.

33:27.698 --> 33:29.446
Can I ask you something?

33:29.509 --> 33:31.759
Yeah, anything, what?

33:31.919 --> 33:35.149
I get the VIP treatment,
and the fancy nights out.

33:35.875 --> 33:38.917
What do you see in these
guys that you go out with?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.875
Well, they fit into my schedule,

33:40.959 --> 33:43.517
and they don't ask questions.

33:43.765 --> 33:45.515
Is that enough for you?

33:45.834 --> 33:47.500
Well, it has been so far.

33:49.333 --> 33:51.166
I like my independence,
I liked deciding

33:51.250 --> 33:53.542
what I want to do and when,

33:53.867 --> 33:57.290
and I like having the freedom
of not being tied down.

33:57.460 --> 33:58.479
So that's it?

33:58.490 --> 33:59.583
Yeah, that's it.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.083
I like my life the way it is.

34:01.166 --> 34:02.667
It's not complicated.

34:03.973 --> 34:07.114
And besides the most honest
relationships I've ever had,

34:07.125 --> 34:09.333
have been when I've
been a mistress.

34:09.417 --> 34:10.435
But...

34:11.529 --> 34:14.654
don't you want
emotional intimacy?

34:15.101 --> 34:18.337
I know you, you have the
most beautiful soul Veronica.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.389
I just don't get it.

34:20.679 --> 34:23.304
I have just learned
not to need it.

34:23.315 --> 34:24.690
Besides I have friends for that.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.851
I have Trent, I have you.

34:26.918 --> 34:28.001
And I have Steve.

34:28.012 --> 34:29.969
So it's all about the
physical with these men?

34:30.041 --> 34:32.376
No, it's about
making my life easier.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.458
I don't have to invest.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.668
I can walk away when I want to.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.375
Well, that's a pretty
pathetic way to live.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.944
I mean sure maybe you don't
get hurt along the way,

34:40.955 --> 34:42.562
but years from now?

34:44.036 --> 34:45.155
Don't you judge me,

34:45.166 --> 34:46.833
I mean you fix your insecurities

34:46.917 --> 34:49.000
with the occasional
woman who feeds your ego,

34:49.083 --> 34:53.250
and I fix mine by not letting
anyone know all about me.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.053
I mean we're basically
doing the same thing,

34:55.083 --> 34:56.291
but in different ways.

34:57.817 --> 34:59.333
And yes, it can get tiresome

34:59.417 --> 35:01.924
to always have to
stay on my game but,

35:02.041 --> 35:03.875
beats the alternative.

35:03.886 --> 35:05.739
And the alternative is what?

35:05.750 --> 35:07.834
Having a meaningful,
valuable relationship

35:07.917 --> 35:09.709
with a man that
you're intimate with?

35:10.929 --> 35:14.262
Look I know, I've been
guilty of feeding my ego.

35:15.341 --> 35:18.258
But in the meantime, I know
deep down what I really want.

35:18.269 --> 35:19.656
Do you think for a second

35:19.667 --> 35:21.452
there haven't been some
of these one-nighters

35:21.463 --> 35:23.750
that I didn't have some
hope that maybe, just maybe,

35:23.761 --> 35:25.674
I'd meet somebody special?

35:27.188 --> 35:28.188
No.

35:28.351 --> 35:29.934
No?

35:30.334 --> 35:32.014
To me, the alternative's
being vulnerable

35:32.025 --> 35:34.900
and being vulnerable,
vulnerable people get hurt,

35:34.924 --> 35:38.111
and I just don't want
that to happen to me.

35:39.185 --> 35:41.614
And are you really so
deluded that you think

35:41.625 --> 35:44.669
that a one-night stand
could be any more than that?

35:44.680 --> 35:46.102
By very definition
it's nothing more

35:46.113 --> 35:47.197
than a one-night affair.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.542
I'm not trying to
pick a fight with you.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.931
We just have never had
this discussion before.

35:51.959 --> 35:53.936
I'm just trying to understand.

35:53.947 --> 35:56.739
Chalk it up to being
a better friend.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.041
And you're right,

35:58.125 --> 35:59.709
a one-night stand is just that.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.142
I've just never known
anyone like you, that's all.

36:05.036 --> 36:06.537
And since we're sharing,

36:06.548 --> 36:08.693
why don't you tell me the
story about your divorce,

36:08.704 --> 36:10.743
and why haven't
you ever told me?

36:14.004 --> 36:18.102
Well, we met in
photography school,

36:19.306 --> 36:20.595
and...

36:21.382 --> 36:22.465
as soon as we graduated

36:22.476 --> 36:24.498
we really struggled
to find work.

36:25.502 --> 36:27.489
But I just kept feeding
my passion for shooting

36:27.500 --> 36:29.083
landscapes and coastlines,

36:29.166 --> 36:31.417
and in the process
I built a career,

36:31.500 --> 36:33.583
but she was still floundering.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.959
She couldn't find
her voice, you know?

36:36.041 --> 36:38.903
Well that's a dangerous
place for an artist.

36:38.927 --> 36:40.875
And time went on and,

36:40.959 --> 36:43.709
I was being published, and
her career was stagnant and,

36:44.616 --> 36:47.366
more and more, she just
wouldn't even look at my work,

36:47.959 --> 36:49.583
like she resented me.

36:51.190 --> 36:53.263
I think she fell out of
love with photography,

36:53.274 --> 36:56.700
and in the process, fell
out of love with me also.

36:59.289 --> 37:00.614
It's sad.

37:00.833 --> 37:02.850
The one thing that brought
the two of you together,

37:02.861 --> 37:05.434
is the one thing
that drove you apart.

37:12.542 --> 37:14.750
And I didn't tell you because,

37:16.542 --> 37:19.630
even though you weren't
the cause of my divorce,

37:21.625 --> 37:23.959
you were definitely a symptom

37:25.417 --> 37:27.770
of the erosion of
my partnership.

37:34.917 --> 37:36.666
What are we gonna watch?

37:36.677 --> 37:37.689
Hitchcock.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.983
Hitchcock, he made
a lot of movies.

37:39.994 --> 37:42.244
Hitchcock, the movie.

37:42.575 --> 37:44.667
You'll like it.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.041
I think it has nudity in it.

37:47.125 --> 37:48.599
Scooch over.

37:52.750 --> 37:53.750
You ready.

37:58.750 --> 38:00.959
(screaming)

38:06.583 --> 38:07.740
[Man On TV]
<i>Darling, we've watched</i>

38:07.750 --> 38:09.458
<i>the film a hundred times.</i>

38:09.542 --> 38:11.031
<i>She doesn't blink.</i>

38:11.792 --> 38:12.792
What?

38:13.583 --> 38:14.583
Nothing.

38:16.136 --> 38:17.761
Okay.

38:20.197 --> 38:21.822
What?

38:22.595 --> 38:25.595
Nothing, shhh watch the movie.

38:34.839 --> 38:37.166
<i>[Man On TV] So with
very little effort,</i>

38:37.250 --> 38:39.834
<i>and the reflex time
of a garden snail,</i>

38:39.917 --> 38:43.417
<i>how does a tortoise's
day compare to ours?</i>

38:43.500 --> 38:46.500
<i>In the time it takes
us to drive 10 miles,</i>

38:46.583 --> 38:49.583
<i>the tortoise manages
to move about 100 feet.</i>

38:50.542 --> 38:52.750
<i>While we eat an entire meal,</i>

38:52.834 --> 38:54.959

38:56.000 --> 38:59.417

38:59.500 --> 39:01.870

39:02.378 --> 39:04.792
<i>The tortoise's way of
making up for that,</i>

39:04.875 --> 39:08.083
<i>isn't to eat more,
but to do less.</i>

39:10.744 --> 39:13.494
(soft piano music)

39:23.500 --> 39:26.166
(phone buzzing)

39:37.215 --> 39:39.841
(door closing)

39:42.375 --> 39:44.292
Good morning, sunshine.

39:44.656 --> 39:46.239
Hey.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.188
I know you're like
a bear with a sore paw

39:48.198 --> 39:51.072
when you don't get
your caffeine fix so.

39:51.083 --> 39:52.166
Thanks.

39:52.679 --> 39:55.720
You know they say this
stuff is actually flammable.

39:58.291 --> 39:59.417
You missed a call.

40:00.458 --> 40:01.458
Thanks.

40:02.625 --> 40:04.208
[Phone] Voicemail received.

40:06.375 --> 40:07.458
You should check that.

40:07.542 --> 40:09.750
Yeah, I'm just
gonna brush my teeth,

40:09.834 --> 40:12.583
and then the
bathroom's all yours.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.583
(romantic piano music)

40:38.583 --> 40:39.583
Okay.

40:40.542 --> 40:41.542
You all set?

40:42.875 --> 40:45.380
Why haven't you
told me about her?

40:46.151 --> 40:47.359
Excuse me.

40:47.959 --> 40:48.959
Who's Kristen?

40:50.057 --> 40:52.365
She's just a woman I know, why?

40:53.151 --> 40:55.234
I think it's a little
bit more than that.

40:57.414 --> 40:58.414
Okay.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.667
Seriously, Brandon?

41:03.132 --> 41:05.257
I mean you're not gonna
tell me about her?

41:07.291 --> 41:09.252
I knew it, I knew it,
that day in the store

41:09.263 --> 41:10.682
when you picked up
that text message,

41:10.692 --> 41:11.818
I knew something was up.

41:13.161 --> 41:14.411
Why couldn't you tell me?

41:15.709 --> 41:17.709
What do you want
to hear Veronica?

41:20.125 --> 41:22.904
I saw a picture of
you and her kissing.

41:25.020 --> 41:27.732
Is this new, how long
has it been going on?

41:28.875 --> 41:30.709
So you woke up and
you went to my phone?

41:30.792 --> 41:34.125
No Brandon, the
phone woke me up,

41:34.208 --> 41:36.542
and I was startled
by the picture.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.098
Startled, really?

41:38.109 --> 41:41.276
Isn't that a little
bit extreme, Ronnie?

41:43.917 --> 41:45.667
To wake up in a bed
that I shared with you

41:45.750 --> 41:46.750
to that picture,

41:48.625 --> 41:50.250
you tell me.

41:51.588 --> 41:53.739
We didn't share the bed, Ronnie.

41:54.249 --> 41:56.357
We fell asleep watching a movie.

42:00.507 --> 42:01.507
What?

42:04.369 --> 42:05.369
Just,

42:07.835 --> 42:10.153
just get me home.

42:12.877 --> 42:16.418
(somber orchestral music)

42:38.738 --> 42:40.405
Hi honey.

42:41.166 --> 42:42.792
Hey.

42:42.875 --> 42:43.500
Welcome home, hotshot.

42:43.583 --> 42:46.000
Oh, thank you, sorry I'm late.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.185
Traffic was hell.

42:47.555 --> 42:48.929
Of course.

42:49.250 --> 42:51.333
God I missed you.

42:55.119 --> 42:57.036
Oh, dinner smells great,

42:57.047 --> 42:58.755
and so do you.

43:01.208 --> 43:02.291
What's this?

43:02.375 --> 43:04.959
That is a birthday present
for your grandnephew.

43:05.041 --> 43:07.542
I figured with all the traveling,
you wouldn't have time,

43:07.625 --> 43:09.709
so I picked it up for you.

43:11.583 --> 43:13.083
Thank you.

43:13.166 --> 43:14.563
You are welcome.

43:15.233 --> 43:17.976
Why don't you open up that bottle
of wine right there, do you mind?

43:17.987 --> 43:20.195
I tried but I couldn't.

43:25.083 --> 43:27.239
So, how was the trip?

43:27.921 --> 43:29.671
Got some good shots.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.715
I think the publisher's gonna
like the direction it's going.

43:32.729 --> 43:34.813
Can't wait to see it.

43:43.565 --> 43:44.565
What?

43:45.506 --> 43:46.506
Nothing.

43:50.222 --> 43:51.222
Okay.

43:53.195 --> 43:55.903
Would you mind
lighting the candles?

43:56.518 --> 43:57.518
Sure.

43:58.625 --> 44:00.709
You know how I am with fire.

44:15.083 --> 44:17.634
I can't believe that he's
been seeing her for six months,

44:17.645 --> 44:20.500
and he's never mentioned
her to me, not a word.

44:20.583 --> 44:22.792
I mean, I mean
call me crazy but,

44:22.875 --> 44:25.709
when you know someone
that long and that well,

44:25.792 --> 44:27.543
doesn't it seem odd,

44:27.804 --> 44:30.887
and why has he never
introduced me to her?

44:32.187 --> 44:33.187
I don't care.

44:35.834 --> 44:36.834
Come here.

45:03.750 --> 45:05.250
You are fantastic.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.917
Stay with me tonight.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.250
No.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.375
I'm clear until tomorrow.

45:13.458 --> 45:15.332
She's out of town on business.

45:16.601 --> 45:18.226
I can't.

45:18.872 --> 45:21.206
I don't want to
get used to this.

45:23.709 --> 45:28.000
Well, I guess that's something
I'll have to get used to.

45:34.333 --> 45:37.417
You know there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

45:37.500 --> 45:40.653
I have a client who's
looking for a rare book,

45:40.664 --> 45:42.996
and we can't seem to find it.

45:43.007 --> 45:44.155
What is it?

45:44.166 --> 45:46.458
It's called the Emerald Whaler,

45:46.469 --> 45:50.010
written by William
J Lowbenstein.

45:52.022 --> 45:53.231
Lubby.

45:53.304 --> 45:54.638
Oh, you've heard of him?

45:55.754 --> 45:56.754
Maybe.

45:58.228 --> 46:02.715
Well, I need a first
edition, 1960, signed copy.

46:03.411 --> 46:05.403
Can you find that for me?

46:05.976 --> 46:07.934
It'll be rare, expensive,

46:09.750 --> 46:11.333
and if I say yes will
that persuade you

46:11.417 --> 46:13.709
to stay with me tonight?

46:13.792 --> 46:14.792
No.

46:17.171 --> 46:19.762
But it'll make me very happy.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.039
Can I help you find something?

46:38.125 --> 46:40.437
Oh hi, yes thank you.

46:41.291 --> 46:43.656
Well I'm looking
for a book about

46:44.250 --> 46:45.667
dating after divorce.

46:45.750 --> 46:48.500
Hmmm, well I'm not
sure reading a book's

46:48.583 --> 46:50.296
really gonna help you.

46:51.783 --> 46:53.945
What would you
look for in a man?

46:54.583 --> 46:56.250
Well that varies actually.

46:57.709 --> 47:00.265
But he doesn't have to
be a saint though, does he?

47:01.250 --> 47:03.715
I tell you what, why don't you
make me a list of attributes

47:03.726 --> 47:07.234
that I might possess, which
will be attractive to a woman,

47:07.245 --> 47:09.328
such as yourself.

47:11.542 --> 47:13.166
Trent.

47:13.250 --> 47:14.598
Need your help.

47:14.638 --> 47:16.291
Someone will come and help you.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.000
I can wait until you're through.

47:19.114 --> 47:20.247
I'm sorry.

47:20.258 --> 47:22.364
No it's just that I've
been married for 30 years,

47:22.375 --> 47:24.934
and now, newly single.

47:25.970 --> 47:28.638
Well, being a gentleman
never goes out of style,

47:28.649 --> 47:32.879
and women love honesty.

47:34.814 --> 47:35.970
Brandon?

47:35.981 --> 47:36.832
Hey.

47:36.843 --> 47:37.843
Hi Trent.

47:42.588 --> 47:44.004
What?

47:44.015 --> 47:46.012
Let me take care of this guy.

47:46.125 --> 47:47.291
Why?

47:47.302 --> 47:48.677
He's cute, he's single,

47:48.688 --> 47:50.615
I thought you'd be thrilled
that I'm talking to him.

47:50.625 --> 47:51.426
He's gay.

47:51.437 --> 47:52.437
No.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.625
Trust me.

47:55.375 --> 47:56.542
He is?

47:56.625 --> 47:58.238
I know it.

47:58.542 --> 48:01.215
Worked it out with
Brandon, he's cuter.

48:02.291 --> 48:03.957
Fine.

48:09.709 --> 48:10.709
Hey.

48:12.247 --> 48:13.247
Seriously?

48:14.041 --> 48:15.291
You pitch a fit up in Pismo

48:15.375 --> 48:17.041
and now you're not
taking my calls.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.125
That sounds about right.

48:19.722 --> 48:22.333
Ronnie, clearly you're
upset, but I haven't a clue--

48:22.417 --> 48:23.959
Don't you understand
why I'm upset?

48:24.041 --> 48:26.750
Please, please,
tell me what exactly

48:26.834 --> 48:28.000
I'm dealing with here.

48:28.083 --> 48:30.125
You lied to me,
you kept secrets.

48:30.136 --> 48:31.041
I lied?

48:31.125 --> 48:32.125
What did I lie about?

48:33.054 --> 48:36.292
Okay, I haven't mentioned
Kristen to you, but lied?

48:36.375 --> 48:37.875
It's a lie by omission.

48:37.959 --> 48:39.041
A what?

48:39.125 --> 48:42.273
If you lead someone
to believe one thing,

48:42.284 --> 48:43.740
based on your words
and your actions

48:43.750 --> 48:46.834
and then it turns out to be
something completely different,

48:46.917 --> 48:48.542
that's a lie.

48:48.625 --> 48:50.333
I still don't get it.

48:50.417 --> 48:51.667
Of course you don't.

48:51.750 --> 48:54.750
I didn't lie, I
just didn't tell you.

48:54.834 --> 48:57.660
Yeah, well that's just
guys' slight of hand.

48:58.301 --> 48:59.333
Where am I going?

48:59.417 --> 49:00.816
Goodbye Brandon.

49:02.278 --> 49:03.579
We're not done here.

49:03.590 --> 49:04.805
Yes we are.

49:04.816 --> 49:05.777
(bell ringing)

49:05.788 --> 49:07.152
I'll call you later.

49:08.985 --> 49:11.409
He didn't
technically lie to you.

49:11.934 --> 49:13.899
Don't you start now.

49:13.910 --> 49:16.333
Veronica, he doesn't
owe you anything.

49:16.417 --> 49:18.792
He owes me respect.

49:18.875 --> 49:22.000
I couldn't care less that
he's seeing somebody,

49:22.083 --> 49:23.697
but hiding it from me?

49:23.708 --> 49:25.959
Telling somebody that
you've never lied,

49:26.041 --> 49:28.333
just because someone hasn't
asked a specific question,

49:28.417 --> 49:30.723
doesn't somehow make the truth.

49:39.797 --> 49:42.542
Wasn't Trent fantastic
the other night?

49:42.625 --> 49:43.625
Oh, the show was great.

49:43.709 --> 49:45.542
I'm so proud of you.

49:45.625 --> 49:47.417
Thank you, not too blue?

49:47.500 --> 49:49.542
No.

49:49.553 --> 49:51.387
Well, you did push the
envelope a little bit,

49:51.398 --> 49:53.414
but yeah, it was really good.

49:53.425 --> 49:55.773
Why didn't you do your
bit about the royal family?

49:55.784 --> 49:58.041
Well I like to think
I have a little more

49:58.125 --> 49:59.542
originality than that.

49:59.625 --> 50:00.458
Huh.

50:00.542 --> 50:02.000
Huh?

50:02.083 --> 50:03.375
You know I was laughing so much

50:03.458 --> 50:05.792
I had tears rolling
down my cheeks.

50:05.875 --> 50:06.750
Really?

50:06.834 --> 50:08.583
You know you should
do more comedy.

50:08.667 --> 50:10.709
I think you may have
missed your calling.

50:11.208 --> 50:12.472
Maybe I will.

50:12.483 --> 50:14.333
(phone ringing)

50:17.208 --> 50:19.010
Still not speaking with him?

50:19.073 --> 50:19.784
No.

50:19.795 --> 50:21.416
- Who?
- Brandon.

50:21.908 --> 50:23.364
What did he do now?

50:23.375 --> 50:25.375
Well he didn't
do anything wrong.

50:25.458 --> 50:27.440
You tell it, what did he do?

50:28.166 --> 50:31.250
Is a lie by omission a
lie, or is it the truth?

50:32.333 --> 50:34.208
But there's no truth in a lie.

50:34.291 --> 50:36.750
But it's not a lie if no
one actually said anything.

50:36.761 --> 50:38.276
Schschm...

50:38.666 --> 50:41.823
Is what Brandon didn't tell you,

50:41.930 --> 50:45.472
not said maybe to
spare your feelings?

50:45.542 --> 50:48.125
Look it doesn't
matter how I feel.

50:48.208 --> 50:49.625
I thought we were
closer than that,

50:49.709 --> 50:52.000
I thought we could tell
each other everything.

50:53.166 --> 50:56.625
Now I, I don't
trust him anymore.

50:57.336 --> 51:00.182
Bring me up to speed here.

51:00.552 --> 51:02.114
Okay, here's what happened.

51:02.125 --> 51:04.366
Ronnie found out that Brandon
has been seeing someone.

51:04.377 --> 51:05.245
So?

51:05.256 --> 51:06.964
For over six months?

51:07.168 --> 51:10.460
Oh honey, he has
feelings for you.

51:10.475 --> 51:12.940
He's been single
for almost five years.

51:12.959 --> 51:14.948
He's never made a move on me.

51:14.959 --> 51:17.448
He's never even offered
me any kind of affection,

51:17.459 --> 51:19.327
other than friendship.

51:19.338 --> 51:21.445
And we've always had this
open line of communication

51:21.456 --> 51:23.500
when it comes to dating.

51:23.511 --> 51:26.595
I mean, we practically
tell each other everything.

51:26.606 --> 51:29.690
So you were closer with
Brandon than anyone else?

51:29.701 --> 51:31.070
Don't you think it's kind of odd

51:31.080 --> 51:33.291
that you haven't
found a relationship?

51:33.375 --> 51:37.166
Maybe he's just filling the gap
of what you expect from men?

51:37.250 --> 51:39.625
Look, we all know,
everyone knows,

51:39.636 --> 51:41.929
that the two of you have
feelings for each other.

51:41.940 --> 51:43.834
Maybe he didn't tell
you about the girl

51:43.917 --> 51:45.458
because he knew it
would affect you.

51:45.542 --> 51:48.083
No, I would have been
fine if he'd told me.

51:49.529 --> 51:51.779
Really, I want him to be happy.

51:51.790 --> 51:53.073
Then why are you
ignoring his calls

51:53.083 --> 51:54.674
instead of celebrating with him.

51:54.705 --> 51:56.484
Let's do a little
survey shall we?

51:56.495 --> 51:57.834
Oh yes, let's.

51:57.845 --> 51:59.303
Mm-hmmm.

51:59.314 --> 52:02.356
When you're not with Brandon,
do you think about him?

52:02.583 --> 52:03.583
Yes.

52:04.484 --> 52:06.109
But I also think about Trent.

52:06.583 --> 52:07.875
Okay, fair enough.

52:07.959 --> 52:13.000
Where did Brandon have
lunch last Monday?

52:13.512 --> 52:14.987
Piccolo Paradisio.

52:15.065 --> 52:17.731
Where did Trent
have lunch yesterday?

52:18.886 --> 52:22.041
I didn't have lunch, I
stayed in the store, remember?

52:23.158 --> 52:24.377
I've got one.

52:24.388 --> 52:26.721
Who do you call when you
need help with something?

52:27.208 --> 52:27.959
Brandon.

52:28.041 --> 52:30.440
Mm-hmm, and yet I'm closer.

52:30.854 --> 52:32.843
[Steve] Do you answer his texts

52:32.854 --> 52:34.417
when you're with someone else?

52:34.500 --> 52:35.875
Sometimes, it depends.

52:35.959 --> 52:37.125
Mm-hmm, depends.

52:37.208 --> 52:39.542
Where does Brandon
get his hair cut?

52:39.625 --> 52:41.276
Oh, the Last Tango.

52:41.287 --> 52:42.960
Karen's been his girl for years.

52:42.971 --> 52:44.959
Where does Trent
get his hair cut?

52:45.702 --> 52:47.114
I cut his hair.

52:47.125 --> 52:47.834
I knew that.

52:47.917 --> 52:49.375
Bullshit.

52:49.458 --> 52:52.583
Can he answer all those
questions about you?

52:52.667 --> 52:54.031
Um, most of them,
but probably not

52:54.041 --> 52:56.208
where I get my hair cut.

52:57.542 --> 52:58.667
I rest my case.

52:58.750 --> 53:01.375
You say that you want
Brandon to be happy,

53:01.458 --> 53:05.135
but you are the one that wants
to make him feel that way.

53:07.518 --> 53:11.103
See, he's not just a great
cook, he's also a genius.

53:11.114 --> 53:12.144
Genius.

53:12.155 --> 53:13.489
Genius.

53:13.500 --> 53:17.223
You keep pushing him away
and you're gonna lose him.

53:17.234 --> 53:20.692
(phone ringing)

53:24.164 --> 53:25.581
[Brandon] It's about time.

53:26.534 --> 53:28.174
I know, I'm sorry.

53:29.667 --> 53:31.583
Can I come by so we can talk?

53:31.667 --> 53:33.401
[Brandon] Sure, I'm in.

53:34.041 --> 53:37.792
(doorbell ringing)

53:40.166 --> 53:42.500
(gentle guitar music)

53:44.949 --> 53:46.241
Please, come in.

53:56.086 --> 53:58.006
Can I get you anything?

53:59.062 --> 54:00.687
Do you have some wine?

54:01.083 --> 54:02.740
I think I do.

54:17.291 --> 54:18.417
Here, open this will you?

54:18.428 --> 54:20.166
I'll get some wine glasses.

54:20.177 --> 54:21.260
All right.

54:31.331 --> 54:32.737
Nice work.

54:34.208 --> 54:35.471
Thank you.

54:40.710 --> 54:41.793
Thank you.

54:43.096 --> 54:44.381
I'm here.

54:46.952 --> 54:49.936
I have to come clean
with you about something.

54:51.395 --> 54:52.943
And I need your help.

54:56.917 --> 54:57.917
All right.

54:59.603 --> 55:01.020
Is that all I get?

55:01.031 --> 55:03.989
I'm not sure what it is
you've come here to say.

55:05.834 --> 55:08.375
First of all, I am
sorry that I reacted

55:08.386 --> 55:09.517
the way I did in Pismo.

55:09.528 --> 55:11.357
I mean that was a nice trip.

55:11.882 --> 55:13.632
I felt like I ruined it.

55:17.623 --> 55:19.289
And second?

55:27.709 --> 55:30.250
I have hard alcohol if
that'll make this easier.

55:30.333 --> 55:32.750
Brandon don't joke, this
is hard enough as it is.

55:32.834 --> 55:33.834
I see that.

55:36.922 --> 55:39.047
I don't know where to start.

55:39.333 --> 55:41.504
You're the only person that
I can talk to about this,

55:41.520 --> 55:43.868
and yet at the same time
you're the only one I can't.

55:43.879 --> 55:45.583
Oh Ronnie, it's okay.

55:45.667 --> 55:47.568
You're safe with me.

55:50.015 --> 55:52.474
My anger came from jealousy.

55:54.062 --> 55:56.951
And it's not right,
it's not me and,

55:58.451 --> 56:03.232
I don't want to feel the way
that I feel about you and,

56:04.375 --> 56:07.646
and I want you to help
make those feeling go away.

56:08.041 --> 56:09.417
What feelings?

56:09.500 --> 56:11.059
The ones that make
me want to kiss you,

56:11.070 --> 56:13.341
when I look at you sometimes.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.041
I'm trying to understand why

56:20.125 --> 56:23.125
you need those
feelings to disappear.

56:23.208 --> 56:25.625
Because they're
not right, or fair,

56:25.709 --> 56:27.458
or safe for me to have them.

56:27.469 --> 56:29.052
What are you afraid of?

56:29.063 --> 56:30.063
Losing.

56:30.074 --> 56:31.074
Me?

56:33.160 --> 56:34.160
No, me.

56:34.807 --> 56:36.390
(door closing)

56:36.513 --> 56:39.014
Hold that thought.

56:40.125 --> 56:41.474
In here, honey.

56:42.625 --> 56:43.917
I am such a dip,

56:44.000 --> 56:45.667
I can't find my phone.

56:48.625 --> 56:49.625
Hi.

56:50.007 --> 56:51.007
Hello.

56:51.146 --> 56:52.959
Honey, this is Veronica.

56:53.041 --> 56:55.169
Veronica, meet Kristen.

56:55.208 --> 56:56.333
Oh my God.

56:56.417 --> 56:58.779
It's so nice to
finally meet you,

56:59.854 --> 57:01.896
and I'm sorry I'm
in such a rush.

57:01.907 --> 57:03.533
Oh, here it is.

57:04.291 --> 57:05.798
And I'm late, I gotta go.

57:05.809 --> 57:07.045
Nice to meet you, Kristen.

57:07.056 --> 57:08.083
Nice meeting you too.

57:08.166 --> 57:09.375
Okay, great, drive safe.

57:09.458 --> 57:11.792
Let me know when you
get there, please.

57:11.875 --> 57:13.155
He's always making me check in.

57:15.331 --> 57:16.331
See you later.

57:19.253 --> 57:20.878
Wow.

57:22.120 --> 57:24.818
Living together in
less than six months.

57:29.500 --> 57:30.500
What?

57:30.709 --> 57:31.709
Nothing.

57:31.883 --> 57:33.799
- Okay.
- What?

57:34.583 --> 57:36.977
Nothing, I think I should go.

57:37.008 --> 57:39.709
No, hold on a second.

57:39.792 --> 57:43.166
You want me to believe you
have these feelings for me,

57:43.250 --> 57:45.500
but for a whole week
you've been cold,

57:45.583 --> 57:48.296
unkind, and ignore
me to the point

57:48.307 --> 57:50.418
that I thought you never
wanted to speak to me again.

57:50.429 --> 57:53.512
You have a very strange way of
showing your heart, Veronica.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
You know me

57:56.917 --> 57:58.750
better than anyone else.

57:59.816 --> 58:03.633
But I don't want to have
these feelings for anybody,

58:03.959 --> 58:05.208
let alone you.

58:05.291 --> 58:07.500
And then to have your
girlfriend thrust in my face,

58:07.583 --> 58:09.125
it completely broadsided me.

58:09.208 --> 58:11.041
I didn't even know how to act.

58:11.125 --> 58:13.375
And you really want these
feelings to just go away?

58:13.458 --> 58:14.959
Yes, desperately.

58:18.083 --> 58:19.875
And if Kristen
wasn't in the picture,

58:19.959 --> 58:21.041
would you feel differently?

58:21.125 --> 58:23.500
I don't know. She is--

58:26.687 --> 58:28.646
When has that ever
mattered to you?

58:32.892 --> 58:34.518
Oh that's not fair.

58:34.529 --> 58:36.862
I have so much more to lose.

58:39.471 --> 58:40.471
Do you?

59:13.709 --> 59:15.500
Oh make love to me.

59:16.417 --> 59:17.417
Please.

59:37.583 --> 59:40.834
(romantic piano music)

01:02:01.668 --> 01:02:03.387
Call you tomorrow?

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:05.535
I'll be at the store.

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:17.500
Goodnight.

01:02:18.965 --> 01:02:20.175
Goodnight.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.449
I know you want
to make more room,

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.375
but we could store most
of these in the back,

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:43.698
and you could sell them online.

01:02:43.709 --> 01:02:45.583
They're all going to
the local libraries.

01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:46.667
Even better.

01:02:49.913 --> 01:02:51.820
What time do you have?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Quarter to four.

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:56.171
What?

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:01.709
Take these out please.

01:03:01.792 --> 01:03:02.792
Okay.

Brandon's on line one.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:25.967
Hi.

01:03:26.047 --> 01:03:27.339
Hey.

01:03:28.458 --> 01:03:29.865
I was wondering
when you might call.

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:32.506
Yeah, I'm sorry I just got out
of a meeting with my publisher.

01:03:32.537 --> 01:03:35.542
Oh well, I've been
busy, it's fine.

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:36.751
How did it go?

01:03:36.762 --> 01:03:41.125
I'm not convinced they're in love with the
concept of my new book, but such is life.

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:42.333
Wasn't it just a scout?

01:03:42.344 --> 01:03:44.418
Yeah yeah, and I did a tap
dance to put them at ease,

01:03:44.428 --> 01:03:47.364
but I'm definitely gonna
have to go back up north

01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:48.959
and give them some new looks.

01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:50.166
Sooner, rather than later.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:52.208
Anyway, so what's new?

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.959
Um, nothing.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.125
Just today.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:58.808
Oh, I told my agent
I'd get back to him

01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:00.083
after my meeting.

01:04:00.094 --> 01:04:01.434
Can I reach out to you later

01:04:01.445 --> 01:04:03.112
about us maybe getting together?

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.333
It absolutely kills
your sex life.

01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:56.417
Careful.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:00.250
Careful, somebody want to
give me a ride home tonight?

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:01.875
I might need one.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.250
Um, another thing that
really gets in the way

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:06.542
of peoples' sex lives, is pets.

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:08.542
Yeah, have you ever
noticed that when

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:10.041
there's an animal in the room,

01:06:10.052 --> 01:06:12.088
it's almost impossible to
keep your mind in the game?

01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:13.949
Right? It's kind of
distracting and creepy,

01:06:13.959 --> 01:06:15.041
'cause they watch.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:16.949
I will kill you bitch
if you tell that story.

01:06:16.959 --> 01:06:18.917
Oh you've said
that so many times.

01:06:19.466 --> 01:06:21.365
So tonight, and they're
giving me the light now,

01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.542
it's time for me to go.

01:06:22.553 --> 01:06:23.887
I'm gonna go home
with my husband

01:06:23.898 --> 01:06:26.083
and we're going to
have some ice cream,

01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:29.583
and get into our PJ's, and
watch the Golden Girls.

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:31.716
And not have sex.

01:06:31.727 --> 01:06:33.336
All right, I'm Trent
Masterson, goodnight everyone.

01:06:33.346 --> 01:06:34.455
Thank you.

01:06:34.466 --> 01:06:38.591
(audience applauding)

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:41.625
Yeah, he did.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:46.625
I am really glad that he
brought that animal bit

01:06:46.709 --> 01:06:48.583
back into the act.

01:06:48.667 --> 01:06:50.417
Come on, everyone's
had that experience

01:06:50.428 --> 01:06:51.489
once or twice, right?

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.250
Tell them about the moray eel.

01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:54.375
Oh no no, that hurt.

01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:56.699
No, you've had
that happen, right?

01:06:56.709 --> 01:06:57.542
Come on Brandon.

01:06:57.625 --> 01:06:59.583
Oh you don't have
to answer that.

01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:00.750
Don't worry, I won't.

01:07:04.656 --> 01:07:06.500
Kristen's sorry she
couldn't be here tonight,

01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:07.981
she really wanted to come.

01:07:07.992 --> 01:07:10.125
Well, you all just have
to come to the next one.

01:07:10.136 --> 01:07:11.145
It's a date.

01:07:11.156 --> 01:07:11.896
Great.

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:13.239
Who wants more wine?

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:14.250
[Trent] Yes please.

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.834
She's looking good, isn't she?

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.875
Yes, she is.

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.959
So glad you guys made up.

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:27.542
Steven, where do I
find your bottle opener?

01:07:27.625 --> 01:07:28.699
Second drawer on the left,

01:07:28.709 --> 01:07:30.125
right by the stove.

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:31.208
Second drawer down.

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:33.319
Got it.

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:37.693
So, Brandon, do you know where
Veronica gets her hair cut?

01:07:37.892 --> 01:07:39.803
I can't say that I do, why?

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:41.458
Just wondering.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:44.200
[Veronica] Oh crap!

01:07:44.534 --> 01:07:45.695
[Trent] What, you all right?

01:07:45.706 --> 01:07:48.375
Yeah, I will be.

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:50.592
I'd better give her a hand.

01:07:54.294 --> 01:07:56.419
I broke the cork.

01:07:58.193 --> 01:07:59.775
Let me help.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.221
Wa la.

01:08:08.232 --> 01:08:10.033
Show-off.

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:21.709
(soft rock music)

01:08:23.054 --> 01:08:25.804
Thanks for including
me tonight, that was fun.

01:08:28.462 --> 01:08:30.580
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.207
What's wrong?

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.375
Nothing.

01:08:37.401 --> 01:08:39.041
Okay.

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:40.125
Okay?

01:08:40.207 --> 01:08:41.207
Forget it.

01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:05.041
I don't think I can do this.

01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:06.166
Do what?

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:07.500
This, us.

01:09:10.959 --> 01:09:12.595
It's not fun anymore.

01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:19.375
Did I not just tell you
what a good time I had?

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:22.207
Yeah, in words, but your
actions didn't show it.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.709
My actions?

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.125
What are you talking about?

01:09:26.124 --> 01:09:28.707
I don't want to play this game.

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:30.625
I'm sorry, you've lost me.

01:09:31.924 --> 01:09:33.154
I don't think we're capable

01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:35.283
of going back to where we were.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.551
What's different?

01:09:37.562 --> 01:09:38.979
Seriously?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.332
Is this about what
happened the other night?

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.750
Partly, but mostly
it's about you.

01:09:45.928 --> 01:09:47.011
It's about me?

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:51.510
Please, just dumb it down for
(muffled) just a little bit.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.500
I opened up my heart to you,

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:58.328
and basically all I got
was a sexual thank you.

01:10:00.837 --> 01:10:03.102
So it was about the other night.

01:10:03.884 --> 01:10:05.510
(phone notification)

01:10:05.521 --> 01:10:07.650
I thought if anyone was
mature enough to handle that

01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:09.702
it was gonna be you.

01:10:09.848 --> 01:10:11.823
You're the one that
changed Brandon, not me.

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:13.625
Oh really?

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.291
What's changed Veronica?

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.625
This, this is what's changed.

01:10:20.922 --> 01:10:24.172
Our friendship just doesn't
seem natural anymore.

01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:26.407
You put me in a position
of being a mistress

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:30.339
without the respect that
I've come to deserve.

01:10:32.184 --> 01:10:34.823
Well, I'm not gonna
be your plaything.

01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:37.478
We've got to communicate,

01:10:39.476 --> 01:10:42.987
I just don't know where I
fit in your life anymore.

01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.458
I'm in a relationship.

01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:46.208
What do you want from me?

01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:48.198
Not a god damn thing.

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:51.286
You know but now we're here.

01:10:51.297 --> 01:10:53.159
I mean I'm just curious,

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:54.918
what sort of a lie
did you tell her

01:10:54.928 --> 01:10:56.667
so you could spend
the evening with me?

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:58.959
I don't have to lie
to the people I love.

01:11:00.192 --> 01:11:02.693
Well, now I know where
I fit in then, don't I?

01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:04.171
We had a good time Veronica,

01:11:04.182 --> 01:11:05.382
that's never been our problem.

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:08.083
Your maintaining has
been our disconnect.

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:09.834
You don't know what love is.

01:11:09.917 --> 01:11:13.041
You pretend to be a fairy
godmother sprinkling fix-it dust

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.542
from married guy to married guy,

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:17.083
so you can stomach the
lifestyle you've chosen.

01:11:17.166 --> 01:11:20.625
You're a lonely, desperate
empty soul, who has no idea

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:23.522
how to have a transparent
and honest relationship.

01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:24.433
Go to hell.

01:11:24.444 --> 01:11:26.000
See you there.

01:11:26.083 --> 01:11:28.834
Well, you certainly
don't disappoint.

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.600
What can is say, I
learn from the best.

01:11:32.225 --> 01:11:36.772
So I guess we're
done then, aren't we?

01:11:36.783 --> 01:11:38.225
Then we're done.

01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:42.041

Yeah, good, all right.

01:13:47.417 --> 01:13:48.740
Awesome, great, well
I've gotta be honest,

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.458
I'm actually a
little bit anxious.

01:13:50.542 --> 01:13:54.083
Yeah, I've got a high
school reunion coming up,

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:56.617
and I don't want to
say which one it is,

01:13:56.628 --> 01:13:58.323
because that would be a
little bit depressing,

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.484
but I will say that

01:13:59.495 --> 01:14:01.407
the president of the
United States at the time.

01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:02.500
Lincoln.

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:04.333
No, no no, not
Lincoln you asshole.

01:14:04.417 --> 01:14:07.834
No, Mister Jimmy
Carter, good guy.

01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:09.333
And I was reminded
of this recently,

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:10.953
because I was going through
a bunch of old stuff,

01:14:10.963 --> 01:14:12.864
and I found that presidential

01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:14.917
physical fitness
award that I got.

01:14:15.281 --> 01:14:16.447
Remember those?

01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:17.935
You had to do like a million
pushups, a million chin-ups,

01:14:17.945 --> 01:14:19.596
and you had to run really
fast, and you got an award.

01:14:19.606 --> 01:14:21.917
I was shocked that I got
a physical fitness award,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.083
but I was really good at
running away from bullies,

01:14:25.166 --> 01:14:26.667
and I usually got away.

01:14:28.208 --> 01:14:30.291
I'm a little bit nervous
about seeing the bullies

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:31.709
at the reunion,

01:14:31.792 --> 01:14:34.041
but I figure by now they're
all probably divorced

01:14:34.125 --> 01:14:35.667
and just driving for Uber.

01:14:36.986 --> 01:14:39.280
One of the bullies who was
on the football team, and I,

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:41.291
made out underneath
the bleachers.

01:14:42.188 --> 01:14:44.875
Yeah, and thus started
my illustrious career

01:14:44.959 --> 01:14:46.125
as a blackmailer.

01:14:46.792 --> 01:14:48.792
Yeah, oh yeah, I worked it.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:51.375
I was the first
nerd in that school

01:14:51.458 --> 01:14:55.667
to get a jock to give me his
lunch money, and a hand job.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.814
And that was the day
I lost my virginity.

01:14:57.825 --> 01:14:58.959
Goodnight everyone.

01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:01.041
Thank you.

01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:04.166
(audience applauding)

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:16.094
I'm gonna go find Trent.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.250
Hi.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.125
What are you doing here?

01:15:20.208 --> 01:15:22.166
I got an email Trent
was doing a show,

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:23.375
and I figured you'd be here.

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:25.550
So I am.

01:15:27.834 --> 01:15:29.625
Ronnie, I hate how things ended.

01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:30.716
Can we talk?

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:31.739
About what?

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.000
Seriously?

01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:35.875
I think I've heard everything
I want to hear, from you.

01:15:35.959 --> 01:15:38.834
Look, I feel awful about
some of the things I said,

01:15:38.917 --> 01:15:41.417
it wasn't fair, and I
wanted to apologize.

01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:43.333
So, go ahead.

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:46.208
Oh, I can see this
is gonna be fun.

01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:49.333
All right,

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:51.208
when we were together,

01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:54.375
I didn't know how to react.

01:15:55.142 --> 01:15:57.323
I mean I'm in a relationship,
I'm living with someone,

01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:58.999
and then you and I,

01:16:01.374 --> 01:16:03.239
and it felt right,

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.958
and I know somehow
it did for you, too.

01:16:07.398 --> 01:16:09.698
It doesn't matter how
I feel, you have Kristen.

01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:11.069
It shouldn't matter
to you, either.

01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:13.125
Take her out of the
equation for a minute.

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:14.792
I can't, and neither can you.

01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:15.851
Try.

01:16:15.862 --> 01:16:17.520
I am not gonna have
this conversation now,

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.148
and especially not here.

01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:20.743
Fine.

01:16:29.927 --> 01:16:31.042
This better?

01:16:33.846 --> 01:16:36.463
When I lashed out at you,
I said that if anyone

01:16:36.545 --> 01:16:38.875
was mature enough to
handle what happened,

01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:40.358
it would be you.

01:16:40.834 --> 01:16:42.976
The problem was, I couldn't.

01:16:42.987 --> 01:16:44.693
Look, you've already shown
me that you don't love me,

01:16:44.703 --> 01:16:46.667
you don't have to
keep proving it.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.458
Well, that's where you're wrong.

01:16:48.542 --> 01:16:50.166
I need your help here.

01:16:50.177 --> 01:16:51.489
I know you don't
want commitment,

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.428
I know you don't want
to be domesticated.

01:16:53.439 --> 01:16:54.519
Kristen wants those things,

01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:56.291
I didn't think you of all people

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.446
would want me to give that up.

01:16:57.456 --> 01:16:58.782
Why do you keep telling me this

01:16:58.792 --> 01:17:00.583
if you have no intention
of being with me?

01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:02.240
I have no intentions
of being with you?

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:03.450
Well, now you're being stupid.

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.000
Okay, let me tell
you how this is done.

01:17:08.483 --> 01:17:10.075
Remember when my father got sick

01:17:10.086 --> 01:17:12.114
and I had to fly to Chicago?

01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:13.834
Of course, how can I forget?

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:16.041
And you came by to pick
me up for the airport?

01:17:16.125 --> 01:17:17.291
And I was a wreck,

01:17:17.302 --> 01:17:18.594
and I hadn't packed
a god damn thing,

01:17:18.604 --> 01:17:20.425
except a pair of dirty
socks and a toothbrush,

01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:22.747
and you came in, and
you calmed me down,

01:17:22.758 --> 01:17:24.078
and you helped me
get it together,

01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:25.735
and I saw compassion in you

01:17:25.746 --> 01:17:27.497
that I had never seen
in anyone before.

01:17:28.707 --> 01:17:30.352
And when I was back there,
you stayed in touch with me

01:17:30.362 --> 01:17:31.239
every step of the way.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.875
You were right there by my side,

01:17:32.886 --> 01:17:34.037
even though we
were so far apart,

01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:35.661
and the whole time I was gone,

01:17:35.672 --> 01:17:37.375
all I could think
about was this angel

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:39.000
that made me feel
safe and secure

01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:40.417
through those
vulnerable moments,

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.750
and I felt assured that
life was gonna be okay,

01:17:42.834 --> 01:17:45.289
and that's when I
fell in love with you.

01:17:47.508 --> 01:17:49.375
How could you
never tell me that?

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:51.422
I didn't think you were ready.

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:54.917
Veronica we both know
that you know how to act

01:17:54.928 --> 01:17:56.287
like you're feeling something,

01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:58.585
but you don't really truly feel.

01:17:58.709 --> 01:18:00.809
Brandon, I am so invested in us,

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.781
that I could never walk away.

01:18:05.141 --> 01:18:06.291
So I'm afraid.

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:07.500
Afraid of what?

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:09.000
Of failing, of letting you down,

01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:12.266
I don't know how to have
that kind of a relationship.

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:14.500
Just let your guard down,

01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:16.280
and allow me to love you.

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:18.094
I did.

01:18:19.581 --> 01:18:21.656
And then everything changed.

01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:28.250
So, where do we go from here?

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:30.211
I've got to break
it off with Kristen.

01:18:30.258 --> 01:18:32.216
No, no.

01:18:32.994 --> 01:18:35.323
You think it's okay that while
I'm sharing a bed with her,

01:18:35.333 --> 01:18:37.417
I'm telling somebody else
that I'm in love with them?

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.788
You know, you're the only
person in my life, that's stuck?

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.312
You know me better
than anyone else,

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:44.834
and I love you,

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:49.417
but I don't want either
of our lives to change.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.458
I just want to bring sex
into the equation and,

01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:56.377
and I only want
it to be with you.

01:18:58.125 --> 01:19:00.959
Let me get this straight,
you want to be my mistress?

01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:02.041
Yes.

01:19:07.417 --> 01:19:08.792
Please, say something.

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:11.041
Do you really love me?

01:19:11.125 --> 01:19:12.625
Oh I love you with all my heart,

01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:14.962
that's why I want
you to be happy.

01:19:15.296 --> 01:19:18.744
I can't bear not
having you in my life.

01:19:20.125 --> 01:19:23.500
But I've also come to
realize that I like who I am,

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:26.834
and relationships,
are tenuous at best,

01:19:26.917 --> 01:19:28.542
and they're ever-evolving.

01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:29.625
A friendship?

01:19:30.676 --> 01:19:33.468
That's something that
can last a lifetime.

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:35.858
Why would I want
to be with anyone

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:37.744
who doesn't want all of me?

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:39.917
Who's scared to take the risk

01:19:39.953 --> 01:19:42.431
of putting her
feelings on the line?

01:19:42.617 --> 01:19:44.720
I think you're still just
taking the easy way out.

01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:48.123
So you want me to change
who I am to be loved by you?

01:19:48.134 --> 01:19:50.353
I mean you of all people,

01:19:50.603 --> 01:19:52.490
I never thought
you'd ask me that.

01:19:52.501 --> 01:19:54.295
And I don't want the
kind of relationship

01:19:54.306 --> 01:19:55.807
that you're used to having.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.625
It's not enough.

01:19:58.417 --> 01:19:59.834
It's not enough.

01:19:59.917 --> 01:20:01.402
How can this not be enough?

01:20:01.413 --> 01:20:03.605
I'm giving you the world.

01:20:03.616 --> 01:20:06.041
I want someone who
wants more from me

01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:07.653
than the parts that
make them feel good.

01:20:07.663 --> 01:20:09.128
I want them to care enough

01:20:09.139 --> 01:20:10.521
to be committed to
be in the moment.

01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:13.114
I want someone who cares
for me, and loves me,

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.750
and will be in the
trenches with me,

01:20:15.834 --> 01:20:17.667
and not just throw me
a rope to help me out.

01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:19.250
But you have Kristen for that.

01:20:19.333 --> 01:20:21.250
I want you for that.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:22.632
But I'm a mess.

01:20:22.867 --> 01:20:25.867
I'm broken.

01:20:25.878 --> 01:20:28.772
I'm emotionally claustrophobic.

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:29.834
I'm--

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:32.428
Lovely.

01:20:38.192 --> 01:20:40.109
What's this about?

01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:44.033
I can't imagine
my life without you.

01:20:46.584 --> 01:20:49.292
I love you enough
to make this work.

01:20:50.651 --> 01:20:51.651
Your way.

01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:53.820
Huh?

01:20:53.926 --> 01:20:54.926
What?

01:20:57.632 --> 01:20:58.684
Nothing.

01:20:58.695 --> 01:20:59.695
Okay.

01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:01.937
What?

01:21:01.948 --> 01:21:04.048
Nothing, nothing.

Hi beautiful.

01:21:40.674 --> 01:21:43.132
As requested I brought some
more copies of my book.

01:21:43.143 --> 01:21:45.352
Put them on the table,
I'll get right to them.

01:21:52.882 --> 01:21:54.507
What?

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.458
It's daylight, it's public.

01:21:57.542 --> 01:21:59.166
What are you thinking?

01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:03.513
I'll roll the dice.

01:22:09.441 --> 01:22:11.333
Wait a minute, I didn't
know we were scheduled

01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:12.364
to have lunch today.

01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:13.346
We're not.

01:22:13.357 --> 01:22:15.520
I'm here to take out the
number one salesman of my book.

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.447
I told him if he
sold three copies,

01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:18.709
I'd buy him lunch.

01:22:18.792 --> 01:22:20.417
And they're all gone.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.333
All right, well
that means desert too.

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:23.500
Excellent.

01:22:23.544 --> 01:22:25.282
Well, bring me a doggie bag.

01:22:25.332 --> 01:22:27.808
What's in it for me?

01:22:27.819 --> 01:22:29.445
My gratitude.

01:22:29.456 --> 01:22:31.164
That means everything.

01:22:31.198 --> 01:22:33.222
Ah, bye.

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.114
Great show last night.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.583
Thank you.

01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:47.000
How's Steve?

01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:48.333
Oh, I hope to have him

01:22:48.417 --> 01:22:50.834
barefoot and pregnant in
the kitchen in no time.

01:22:50.917 --> 01:22:53.208
Sounds like you're
making steady progress.

01:22:53.291 --> 01:22:56.000
That's us, a happily
married couple.

01:22:58.023 --> 01:22:59.600
Okay, so what's up?

01:23:00.796 --> 01:23:02.294
You and I never had
any lunch date planned

01:23:02.304 --> 01:23:03.583
for me selling your book.

01:23:03.667 --> 01:23:04.542
No.

01:23:04.625 --> 01:23:06.542
And I'm also very
disappointed in you.

01:23:06.625 --> 01:23:07.625
I can see that.

01:23:08.408 --> 01:23:10.179
And what's the problem?

01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:12.933
The problem is I don't
know why we're at lunch.

01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:15.291
Oh, and also Ronnie
told me this morning

01:23:15.302 --> 01:23:16.532
about your little arrangement,

01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:18.542
and I don't approve.

01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:20.041
That's why we're here.

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.590
Can you keep a secret?

01:23:22.601 --> 01:23:24.166
By now you should know I can.

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.590
I mean from Ronnie.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:26.834
I want your word that

01:23:26.917 --> 01:23:28.750
what I'm about to tell
you stays between us.

01:23:28.834 --> 01:23:31.035
You can't tell anyone,
not even your husband.

01:23:31.046 --> 01:23:33.989
Okay well, one of the reasons
we do have a happy marriage

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.069
is because we don't keep
secrets from one another.

01:23:38.667 --> 01:23:40.015
Fair enough.

01:23:40.056 --> 01:23:41.806
Okay, you get a pass on that.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:43.375
But I want you to
promise that Steve

01:23:43.386 --> 01:23:45.222
will keep it in the vault.

01:23:45.233 --> 01:23:48.208
As long as whatever it is
doesn't hurt Ronnie, yeah.

01:23:48.291 --> 01:23:50.038
I broke up with Kristen.

01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:51.917
I'm in love with Veronica.

01:23:51.928 --> 01:23:54.694
I have no interest in
being with anyone else.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.750
Wow!

01:23:57.834 --> 01:23:59.583
Well, why can't we tell?

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:00.875
This would be so good for her.

01:24:00.959 --> 01:24:02.359
Because that
woman's a rare breed.

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:04.959
She's not wired like anyone
else, and you know it.

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:07.007
Okay, so why are you telling me?

01:24:07.018 --> 01:24:08.536
Because you've always been
a little bird in her ear,

01:24:08.546 --> 01:24:11.114
telling her to go out
and find a single guy,

01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:12.832
and leave the
attached ones alone.

01:24:12.843 --> 01:24:14.875
Well, you can't do that anymore.

01:24:14.959 --> 01:24:16.375
I am the single guy.

01:24:17.148 --> 01:24:20.202
Okay, and just how long
do you plan to keep this up?

01:24:20.583 --> 01:24:22.405
As long as it takes.

01:24:23.208 --> 01:24:25.458
I'll tell her eventually,
but until then,

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:26.822
I need you to keep
this a secret.

01:24:28.667 --> 01:24:29.750
A lie by omission.

01:24:31.148 --> 01:24:33.495
I knew there had
to be a good kind.

01:24:33.815 --> 01:24:36.000
Those are called surprises.

01:24:36.083 --> 01:24:37.083
Oh.

01:24:38.659 --> 01:24:40.542
What are you doing?

01:24:40.625 --> 01:24:42.917
Well, can't I text
Steve now and tell him?

01:24:44.502 --> 01:24:45.987
Knock yourself out.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:53.208
(bell ringing)

01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:54.834
Hey guys.

01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:58.228
Hey, I may not be as cute
as Ian, but it's delivered.

01:24:58.239 --> 01:24:59.792
Thank you.

01:24:59.875 --> 01:25:02.153
Well, you still
come a close second.

01:25:02.355 --> 01:25:03.522
How was lunch?

01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:04.817
It was great.

01:25:04.828 --> 01:25:06.420
I told him if he
sold three more books

01:25:06.431 --> 01:25:08.121
I'd take him to Disneyland.

01:25:08.417 --> 01:25:10.965
Don't worry, I gave
him a talking to,

01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:13.644
and no more lies,
only nice surprises.

01:25:13.655 --> 01:25:15.697
Thank you, Trent.

01:25:16.333 --> 01:25:19.709
So, how about
dinner and a movie?

01:25:19.792 --> 01:25:21.593
Well, that's a nice surprise.

01:25:21.604 --> 01:25:23.270
Wonderful.

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:25.145
I'll see you at seven.

01:25:27.625 --> 01:25:30.417
(soft piano music)

01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:59.291
(phone notification)

01:26:02.031 --> 01:26:04.636
If you need to make
a call, it's okay.

01:26:11.312 --> 01:26:12.978
Nope.

01:26:13.482 --> 01:26:15.482
Everyone I need to
talk to is right here.

01:26:15.493 --> 01:26:16.493
Hmm.

01:26:18.195 --> 01:26:19.195
What?

01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:21.718
Nothing.

01:26:23.276 --> 01:26:24.900
Okay.

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:26.547
What?

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.249
Nothing, really.

01:26:33.664 --> 01:26:36.579
At least you could
promise me a movie.

01:26:45.417 --> 01:26:49.166
(romantic orchestral music)

01:27:08.542 --> 01:27:10.917
