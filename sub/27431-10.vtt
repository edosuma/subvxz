WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.129
Previously on Gotham...

00:03.963 --> 00:05.256
Did Walker
destroy Haven?

00:06.174 --> 00:08.551
<i>EDUARDO: This part of the op
is need-to-know.</i>

00:14.933 --> 00:16.434
I come bearing gifts.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.566
Reunification with the mainland

00:23.733 --> 00:25.318
<i>hangs on by a thread.</i>

00:25.485 --> 00:29.072
<i>Toxic chemicals rain down onto
the city, and the government</i>

00:29.239 --> 00:30.657
cuts us adrift for good.

00:31.658 --> 00:32.616
<i>THOMPNNS:
The filtration system</i>

00:32.784 --> 00:34.661
<i>that Lucius designed
is working.</i>

00:35.245 --> 00:36.204
<i>LUCIUS:
It's not glamorous work,</i>

00:36.371 --> 00:39.165
but we are helping to save the
lives of thousands of people.

00:39.791 --> 00:40.708
<i>SELINA:
You're leaving Gotham.</i>

00:40.875 --> 00:42.043
OSWALD:
<i>I</i> believe the time has come

00:42.210 --> 00:44.128
<i>for a change of scenery.</i>

00:44.671 --> 00:46.130
You found a way out of Gotham?

00:46.506 --> 00:47.507
It's a submarine.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.845
<i>OSWALD: Jim Gordon and
Lee Thompkins are man and wife.</i>

00:53.221 --> 00:56.224
<i>He will never see you
as anything but</i>

00:56.391 --> 00:58.476
a dangerous woman
keeping his child

00:58.643 --> 00:59.394
<i>from him.</i>

01:00.562 --> 01:01.854
Eduardo.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.231
Walker.

01:03.940 --> 01:07.151
<i>Professor Strangeâ€œ have you
fixed up 'm no time.</i>

01:13.032 --> 01:15.076
(whirring)

01:28.798 --> 01:30.758
(labored breathing)

01:43.605 --> 01:46.274
<i>WALKER:
Rest easy, Eduardo.</i>

01:49.819 --> 01:52.155
I made you a promise
when I found you

01:52.322 --> 01:53.823
in that hole in Pefia Dura.

01:54.907 --> 01:57.160
<i>And I intend to keep it.</i>

01:58.870 --> 02:01.289
To give you a true purpose

02:02.206 --> 02:05.084
and the strength
to see it through.

02:05.460 --> 02:09.589
However, I'm afraid
this process

02:09.881 --> 02:13.926
will be agonizing
and, unfortunately,

02:14.719 --> 02:16.262
quite lengthy-

02:18.222 --> 02:20.642
Apologies in advance.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.398
(squeaking)

02:54.509 --> 02:55.802
(labored breathing)

03:00.139 --> 03:02.392
You're going to be reborn.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.646
And then you'll be
the bane of the unjust.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.482
The bane of the corrupt.

03:10.733 --> 03:13.778
The bane of anyone
who opposes us.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.576
(screaming)

03:31.629 --> 03:32.922
Radio confirmation.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.174
<i>General Wade's
landing craft docked.</i>

03:35.299 --> 03:37.218
His convoy's
on the way here now.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.303
Reunification day is today.

03:39.804 --> 03:42.473
Harv, that is great news,
but then what?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.475
Just 'cause we rebuild
some bridges

03:44.642 --> 03:46.769
doesn't mean things are
gonna suddenly improve.

03:47.228 --> 03:50.189
So, uh, future got you spooked?

03:50.314 --> 03:52.024
(sighs) Yeah, I guess.

03:52.483 --> 03:53.901
I mean, I want to believe
things are gonna get better,

03:54.068 --> 03:56.112
but sometimes it's just hard
for me to see it, you know.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.114
Can't say I understand.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.366
I don't have kids, at
least none that I know of.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.660
<i>But you got
one coming,</i>

04:03.411 --> 04:05.538
so we got no choice
but to believe.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.583
It's got to be better than
what we've been through, right?

04:09.542 --> 04:11.252
It damn well better be.

04:13.171 --> 04:16.716
Seven days in a row of
.07 water toxicity levels.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.216
Lucius' filters
did the job.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.844
Eh, good work.
Hope it's not wasted.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.637
Is there a reason to
think there's a problem?

04:21.803 --> 04:23.139
Jim's got a lot on his mind.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.724
What with Gotham
rejoining the world

04:24.891 --> 04:26.601
and a baby coming
into the world next week.

04:26.768 --> 04:27.810
Give it a rest,
Harvey.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.395
All joking aside.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.733
We're here because of you.
Mm-hmm.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.319
And you're gonna be a father.
That's a future I'll take.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.119
Over the past year,

04:46.287 --> 04:47.914
you've all done good work.

04:48.706 --> 04:52.418
We've made Gotham a safe place
for kids and families.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.463
We've given people the food
and medicine they needed.

04:57.173 --> 04:58.674
But it's not over yet.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.970
So, no matter what
General Wade says today,

05:04.430 --> 05:06.057
the work continues.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.102
Give yourselves
one more round of applause.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.732
And get back to work.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.826
Here they come.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.100
Captain Gordon.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.269
Nice to finally
meet you in the flesh.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.604
General,
welcome to Gotham.

05:53.813 --> 05:55.815
Good that you've reestablished
some semblance

05:56.023 --> 05:57.483
of law and order around here.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.193
Seems like
the Green Zone

05:59.360 --> 06:01.487
stretches to every corner
of the island.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.866
General, Wayne Labs
show toxicity levels

06:05.032 --> 06:06.951
way below the threshold
the government set for us.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.536
All due respect,
Mr. Wayne,

06:09.036 --> 06:11.038
but I got to go with what
my people tell me on this.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.875
<i>N' N'</i>

06:37.189 --> 06:39.400
Cutting it a little
close, aren't we?

06:39.817 --> 06:41.027
Is that under 27 pounds,

06:41.193 --> 06:41.944
<i>13 ounces?</i>

06:42.069 --> 06:44.155
It can't possibly
make that big a difference.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.074
It's only the difference
between getting off this island

06:47.283 --> 06:48.868
or sinking to the bottom
of the river.

06:49.035 --> 06:51.746
Well, then Pengy can off-load
a few of his knickknacks.

06:51.913 --> 06:53.205
Not a chance.

06:53.706 --> 06:56.417
Because you know what's worth
its weight in gold?

06:57.793 --> 06:59.670
- Gold.
- Ah!

07:00.379 --> 07:01.797
(groaning)

07:05.259 --> 07:06.677
Congratulations!

07:06.844 --> 07:07.720
(chuckles)

07:08.512 --> 07:11.349
Go to the clinic.
Go have your baby.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.975
What? So the two of you
can hightail it

07:13.142 --> 07:15.186
off this rock without me?
I don't think so.

07:15.353 --> 07:18.397
I assure you we will not
launch without you.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.191
Ed and I will finish
making preparations

07:20.358 --> 07:22.860
and we will be ready to launch
the moment you get back here

07:23.027 --> 07:24.987
with that little bundle of joy.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.574
Or unless I should
drive you to the clinic

07:28.783 --> 07:30.242
in light of your
delicate condition?

07:30.409 --> 07:32.870
I can do it.
I'm not that delicate.

07:33.371 --> 07:35.706
Remember that
if you even think

07:36.040 --> 07:37.500
about double-crossing me.

07:43.798 --> 07:45.132
It's very kind of you
to offer to drive her.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.134
I knew she would
never accept my help.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.305
Should I start the engine?

07:51.472 --> 07:52.848
One less passenger
to worry about.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.308
Oh, two, actually.

07:54.684 --> 07:56.310
You are so right.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.062
(chuckles)

08:19.959 --> 08:22.044
(gasps, chuckles)

08:23.337 --> 08:24.046
Foundit

08:24.672 --> 08:26.090
Ah, well done, Miss Kyle.

08:28.009 --> 08:29.218
All right, let's have a look.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.888
Uh, here we are.

08:34.765 --> 08:38.102
Oh, so this guy's the architect
who designed Wayne Manor?

08:38.269 --> 08:39.477
Yes, right.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.274
With the reunification,
a new Wayne Manor must follow.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.653
And it'll be just
like the old one?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.489
Oh, nothing is
just like it was.

08:51.824 --> 08:54.869
So why are we looking
at the old plans?

08:55.745 --> 08:58.456
Perhaps I'm not ready
to let go of the past.

09:02.334 --> 09:03.544
Well, if it makes
you feel better,

09:03.711 --> 09:06.172
I wish I could
blow up my past.

09:08.883 --> 09:10.342
Well, maybe you will.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.970
One day, when you
build something new,

09:13.137 --> 09:15.556
the past will always
be part of it.

09:16.807 --> 09:17.892
As for me,

09:18.100 --> 09:19.852
now Master Bruce is grown,

09:20.561 --> 09:24.356
building a new manor might be
my last great service to him.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.068
A home.

09:28.903 --> 09:30.196
And then what?

09:32.073 --> 09:33.407
You retire?

09:35.159 --> 09:36.160
No.

09:39.455 --> 09:43.000
I will stand guard,
as I've always done.

09:48.506 --> 09:50.049
I thought this was all settled.

09:50.216 --> 09:51.175
This is bull.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.843
My results are
accurate, Jim.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.179
<i>BULLOCK: We don't know this general.
Maybe he's with Walker.</i>

09:55.346 --> 09:58.516
Let's not get carried away.
Bruce, go and check on the tech.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.268
(radio crackles)

10:01.435 --> 10:02.561
(sighs)

10:03.145 --> 10:04.271
This is Gordon.

10:04.939 --> 10:06.023
THOMPKINS:
It's Lee.

10:06.649 --> 10:07.650
Everything okay?

10:09.735 --> 10:10.903
Barbara just showed up here,

10:11.403 --> 10:12.279
in labor.

10:12.738 --> 10:13.864
You're kidding.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.033
<i>THOMPNNS:
You better come quick.</i>

10:20.663 --> 10:21.872
Are you okay?

10:23.707 --> 10:25.584
Yeah. Yeah.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.005
<i>I'll try to get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

10:31.382 --> 10:32.258
<i>Try to.</i>

10:32.424 --> 10:35.594
Um... try to wait for me.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.472
It doesn't really work that way.

10:38.973 --> 10:39.932
I know.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.143
Okay.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.270
<i>Wait.</i>

10:46.397 --> 10:47.398
I love you.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.234
(labored breathing)

10:51.569 --> 10:52.820
I love you, too.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.280
Jim!

10:55.865 --> 10:56.824
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

10:57.366 --> 10:58.159
We did it.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.077
You did it. We got
through it, Jim.

11:00.286 --> 11:01.162
<i>WADE:
Captain.</i>

11:02.538 --> 11:03.289
All clear.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.665
Congratulations.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.876
Reunification can begin.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.255
Well, I'm glad
I can make you so happy.

11:12.590 --> 11:13.924
Funny thing is, sir,

11:14.508 --> 11:16.510
that's just the second best
news I've gotten today.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.512
(distant rumble)

11:19.430 --> 11:20.097
What's that?

11:20.681 --> 11:21.473
(bang)

11:23.267 --> 11:24.643
- Jim.
- Incoming.

11:27.188 --> 11:28.689
Everybody get back!

11:28.856 --> 11:31.275
Get inside! Get inside!

11:36.822 --> 11:37.656
Go, go.

11:50.044 --> 11:52.004
(gunfire)

12:03.682 --> 12:05.476
(grunting)

12:08.354 --> 12:09.980
(bones crunch)

12:10.147 --> 12:10.898
(man screaming)

12:12.733 --> 12:13.776
Eduardo?

12:16.153 --> 12:17.404
Not anymore.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.730
All right, people, listen up.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.150
I want squads
headed for Knights Stadium,

12:55.442 --> 12:57.653
Yeavley Park,
and Granton Station.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.322
Work your way out.
We got to find him, people.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.492
Bloody hell happened?

13:03.659 --> 13:04.868
Seems that Jim's
old army buddy

13:05.035 --> 13:06.662
wasn't quite as dead
as we'd hoped.

13:07.288 --> 13:08.872
I got squads
covering the north side.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.124
<i>They're sweeping from Coventry</i>

13:10.291 --> 13:12.084
down to Miller Harbor,
but they could be anywhere.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.210
Well, give us an
area to search

13:13.377 --> 13:14.712
- and we'll get it covered.
- Uh...

13:15.379 --> 13:16.130
<i>Take Reatton,</i>

13:16.297 --> 13:17.589
work your way
to South City Park.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.092
Looks like you're not done
protecting Bruce yet, Alfred.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.308
(rasping)

13:32.354 --> 13:33.230
Eduardo.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.775
What did Walker do to you?

13:39.278 --> 13:42.156
When I was
in Pefia Dura prison, Jim,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.241
<i>the guards played a game.</i>

13:45.701 --> 13:47.286
They'd choose one of us...

13:47.453 --> 13:48.871
and they buried us alive.

13:49.747 --> 13:52.041
They'd take bets on whether
you could dig your way out.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.085
But then they'd bury you deeper.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.755
And play again.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.008
I was the champion.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.011
To survive that...

14:05.012 --> 14:07.014
I had to stop being human.

14:08.682 --> 14:12.311
I had to become...
something else.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.522
I became Bane.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.026
<i>Only I didn't know it yet.</i>

14:19.443 --> 14:22.905
But she knew
and she showed me the way.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.200
If the world is full
of monsters,

14:26.367 --> 14:28.369
the only way to defeat them...

14:28.786 --> 14:30.704
is to become one yourself.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.083
I'm sorry.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.627
You were a good soldier.

14:37.836 --> 14:38.754
Hmm.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.297
Don't pity me, Jim.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.675
We are building the future.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.470
She's given me
a purity of mission.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.471
And unlike the army,

14:47.596 --> 14:50.057
she is willing
to carry things out.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.019
A new world is coming.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.021
Strong...

14:57.314 --> 14:58.565
merciless...

14:59.191 --> 15:00.359
unyielding.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.361
I've heard it all before.

15:03.695 --> 15:04.530
Not gonna happen.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.701
And how are you going
to stop me, Jim?

15:10.119 --> 15:10.786
<i>Not me.</i>

15:11.537 --> 15:14.081
You kidnapped Bruce Wayne and
a general of the U.S. Army.

15:14.331 --> 15:17.501
You talk about your future,
Eduardo, but you don't have one.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.170
But Eduardo's dead, Jim.

15:22.381 --> 15:23.924
There is only Bane now.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.051
(door opens)

15:28.095 --> 15:29.012
Rise.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.559
I said rise!

15:34.685 --> 15:35.936
<i>WALKER:
Not so formal.</i>

15:36.603 --> 15:38.147
Captain and I are acquainted.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.151
Get the other one.

15:47.156 --> 15:48.365
I recognize your voice,

15:48.532 --> 15:49.908
but I don't know
what to call you.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.661
<i>I know it's not Walker.</i>

15:53.871 --> 15:55.247
So who are you?

15:56.665 --> 15:58.834
That's a good question.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.755
Perhaps Bruce Wayne can help us
figure that one out.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.716
(footsteps approach)

16:09.803 --> 16:10.762
You Okay?

16:10.929 --> 16:12.306
(panting):
Yeah.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.602
You want hostages?

16:17.352 --> 16:19.146
You've got me and a
general of the U.S. Army.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.481
Let him go.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.149
<i>This has nothing
to do with him.</i>

16:23.317 --> 16:25.277
"This has nothing
to do with him"?

16:26.403 --> 16:28.489
But, Captain, you don't
even know what "this" is.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.076
This, everything
I have done here,

16:33.243 --> 16:35.412
is about punishing Gotham.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.208
For the sins
of Bruce Wayne.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.753
You can start now.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.008
No... no!

16:49.510 --> 16:52.095
(grunts, groans)

16:52.262 --> 16:53.680
And again.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.557
(grunts)

16:57.684 --> 16:58.685
So...

16:59.770 --> 17:01.230
Bruce Wayne.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.358
I'm thinking of a name.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.984
Can you guess whose it is?

17:07.694 --> 17:08.362
What?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.281
Wrong.
And again.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.491
(shouts)

17:13.450 --> 17:15.327
Want to take another guess?

17:20.999 --> 17:23.877
Farewell, my beloved Gotham.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.672
City of my birth.

17:27.923 --> 17:31.009
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.472
Though I leave you today...

17:36.306 --> 17:38.600
my heart will always remain.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.895
I do so hate goodbyes.

17:42.062 --> 17:42.771
Well, you're in luck.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.314
- We're not going anywhere.
- What are you talking about?

17:44.481 --> 17:46.858
Engine won't start; pressure
regulator valve's missing.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.068
Or rather it's stolen.

17:51.822 --> 17:55.325
Barbara!

17:55.951 --> 17:57.995
(exhaling heavily)

17:58.161 --> 17:59.454
Blood pressure's normal.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.583
I'm glad something
about this is normal.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.669
So how long's this gonna take,
Doc, soup to nuts?

18:06.461 --> 18:07.879
Are you in a hurry
or something?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.340
No, it's just that, uh...

18:11.550 --> 18:13.010
I just feel like
you've been...

18:13.176 --> 18:14.761
so great about this, and,

18:15.137 --> 18:16.555
you know, it's been
awkward as hell for you,

18:16.722 --> 18:19.808
and... I haven't even
really said thank you.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.185
I don't expect a thank you
from you, Barbara.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.812
Then perhaps the best
thank you would be for me

18:23.979 --> 18:25.731
to get out of here
as soon as possible.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.861
Whatever's on your mind...

18:31.361 --> 18:33.196
the health of the baby
comes first.

18:34.573 --> 18:35.782
I know that.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.076
So, long haul or short,
we're here.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.245
Until you have
a healthy baby in your arms.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.623
That's all I want.

18:44.541 --> 18:45.667
(softly):
Okay-

18:53.925 --> 18:55.135
(exhales sharply)

18:55.886 --> 18:57.179
<i>'</i> (grunts)
' Stop it!

18:58.555 --> 19:00.724
A name, a person.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.393
The reason
this is all happening.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.480
Can't you guess yet?

19:06.730 --> 19:08.649
I don't know!

19:13.695 --> 19:16.073
If you want to punish
me, then do it.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.616
Hurt me, not him.

19:18.659 --> 19:19.951
I am hurting you.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.871
- (panting) - There's
nothing more painful

19:23.121 --> 19:25.374
than seeing
your friends suffer.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.210
But he's more
than just a friend,

19:28.377 --> 19:29.961
isn't he, Bruce?

19:30.420 --> 19:33.590
Jim Gordon's been
like a father to you.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.342
Oh.

19:35.509 --> 19:39.429
How awful it must be
to watch another father die.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.306
(strained exhale)

19:43.058 --> 19:45.227
Who am I doing this for?

19:45.394 --> 19:46.895
Say the name.

19:48.647 --> 19:49.856
(grunts)

19:51.191 --> 19:52.192
(groans)

19:54.319 --> 19:56.530
When the ones you love die...

19:57.614 --> 20:00.534
it's like a part of yourself
is cut off...

20:00.992 --> 20:02.244
forever.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.496
(sobs)

20:04.663 --> 20:06.039
You know that.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.044
So why do I hate you so much?

20:11.336 --> 20:13.213
Who was cut away from me?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.465
Last chance.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.718
(whimpers)

20:33.191 --> 20:34.234
Yes.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.112
Now you know.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.283
Say his name.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.326
Say it.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.079
Ra's al Ghul.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.417
This is revenge
for his death.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.130
And who am I?

20:57.174 --> 20:58.675
You're his daughter.

21:03.764 --> 21:06.057
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

21:07.058 --> 21:10.604
And revenge is just
the beginning of what I want.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.072
(Bane rasping)

21:22.616 --> 21:24.910
<i>NYSSA". The League of Shadows
is everywhere.</i>

21:25.452 --> 21:28.288
<i>Did you think my father's
mission would die with him?</i>

21:28.789 --> 21:32.542
Humankind will be purged
of weakness.

21:33.585 --> 21:36.296
I'm just starting
with you and yours.

21:39.049 --> 21:40.258
You're right.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.761
I killed Ra's.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.556
So whatever you need to do...

21:46.723 --> 21:47.974
do it to me.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.230
No.

21:53.522 --> 21:56.441
<i>You can't take all the blame
for killing my father.</i>

21:56.817 --> 22:00.987
I mean, you did have
some help, right?

22:02.572 --> 22:06.368
<i>Someone who quite literally
gave you a helping hand.</i>

22:08.912 --> 22:10.664
- What are you doing?
- (yells)

22:17.420 --> 22:19.214
Well done, Barbara.

22:25.428 --> 22:26.972
Go get Barbara Kean.

22:29.599 --> 22:30.475
Eduardo...

22:33.979 --> 22:35.355
She's pregnant.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.441
She's carrying a child.

22:39.484 --> 22:40.902
A child.

22:43.613 --> 22:47.075
One soul's future
weighed against the world's.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.829
Your concern seems petty, Jim.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.919
If he touches a hair
on that child's head,

22:58.461 --> 22:59.963
I will destroy
everything you have.

23:00.130 --> 23:04.050
I don't have anything left,
just my father's mission.

23:09.639 --> 23:12.601
Bane wants you to join
that mission with us.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.063
To see the world as he sees it.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.567
- Never.
- STRANGE: Never say never,

23:20.734 --> 23:22.277
- Captain Gordon.
- No!

23:26.281 --> 23:28.033
<i>NYSSA:
How does it feel, Bruce,</i>

23:29.576 --> 23:31.953
knowing that all of this
is your fault?

23:33.955 --> 23:37.000
Tell me.
I'd really like to know.

23:38.919 --> 23:41.087
(screams)

23:41.254 --> 23:44.424
(groaning)

23:44.758 --> 23:46.426
There must be something
you can give me.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.428
We're out of the drugs
that you need.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.972
It's okay. You're almost there.

23:51.389 --> 23:53.391
I'll get you some ice chips
so you don't get dehydrated.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.101
Gee, thanks.

23:59.230 --> 23:59.898
Lee.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.233
Ed.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.111
Don't worry,
I'm not here for you.

24:06.821 --> 24:10.033
But for the record,
you stabbed me first.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.369
If you two are quite done,

24:12.535 --> 24:14.788
we are actually here
for Barbara.

24:15.038 --> 24:18.375
Or more precisely,
what she stole from us.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.627
I don't know what this is about,
and I don't care.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.212
You two need to get
out of here right now.

24:22.379 --> 24:23.797
(chuckles) Gladly.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.215
<i>Just as soon
as Barbara</i>

24:25.382 --> 24:28.051
gives us the...
What's it called?

24:28.218 --> 24:29.719
- Pressure regulator valve.
- Right.

24:30.178 --> 24:30.971
That.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.639
(sighs)

24:33.181 --> 24:35.517
I should have known that you
would try to screw us over.

24:35.684 --> 24:39.145
You only noticed because you
tried to screw me over first.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.106
Second, technically.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.274
Okay, she's in the middle
of having a baby.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.151
And we are in the
middle of trying

24:45.318 --> 24:47.737
to leave Gotham,
and we can't do that

24:47.904 --> 24:49.990
without a crucial part
of the submarine

24:50.407 --> 24:52.367
which will ferry us
all away from here!

24:52.534 --> 24:53.535
That's why you were
in such a rush

24:53.702 --> 24:56.121
- to get out of here.
- As are we.

24:58.957 --> 25:02.168
Hand over
the part... now.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.212
Don't point that at the baby.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.798
What? No, I did not!

25:06.965 --> 25:10.552
I... I was merely trying
to make a general

25:10.719 --> 25:12.053
threatening gesture
with a firearm.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.638
But you did, though.
You pointed the gun at the baby.

25:13.805 --> 25:17.726
All right, fine. I'm sorry!
Now give us what we want!

25:17.892 --> 25:20.645
No! You think I'm stupid
enough to have the part on me?

25:20.854 --> 25:22.814
It's hidden away,
somewhere safe.

25:22.981 --> 25:26.067
And if you think you can torture
me into telling you where,

25:26.276 --> 25:28.695
there is literally
nothing more painful

25:28.862 --> 25:32.323
than what I am going
through right now!

25:32.490 --> 25:33.199
(explosion)

25:33.366 --> 25:35.076
(screaming in distance)

25:36.578 --> 25:38.204
<i>NURSE:
Hey, you stay out of here.</i>

25:38.371 --> 25:39.372
This is a hospital.

25:39.664 --> 25:40.707
(neck snaps)

25:42.333 --> 25:43.418
(bell dings)

25:45.962 --> 25:47.672
Barbara Kean,

25:48.506 --> 25:50.550
<i>your time is up.</i>

25:51.342 --> 25:53.094
<i>There's no place
for you to hide.</i>

25:54.137 --> 25:55.346
No one will save you.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.057
No mercy that will spare you.

25:58.266 --> 26:01.352
You simply cannot run
from your sins.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.897
And you cannot run from me.

26:15.909 --> 26:17.410
What do you want from me?

26:18.244 --> 26:19.412
(chuckles)

26:22.207 --> 26:25.710
Let me let you in
on a little military secret.

26:27.212 --> 26:30.632
It's called Special Order 386.

26:31.800 --> 26:35.053
In the event that Gotham
is irretrievably lost,

26:35.637 --> 26:37.931
a contingency plan
was put in place

26:38.264 --> 26:41.101
to reduce the city to rubble.

26:44.896 --> 26:45.563
No.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.315
There are still
innocent people here.

26:47.482 --> 26:50.318
You asked me what
I want from you.

26:52.445 --> 26:55.740
I want you to suffer,
Bruce Wayne.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.077
And then I want you to die.

27:02.122 --> 27:05.166
Spend a little time
with that thought.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.545
We'll be starting soon.

27:12.757 --> 27:16.010
<i>N' N'</i>

27:16.970 --> 27:18.638
- Who are those guys?
- No idea.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.141
Exactly how many people
have you screwed over?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.059
Present company
excluded.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.353
There are 79 people
in this building.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.564
Well, fortunately, they seem
to only be trying to kill one.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.108
So, by all means,
let's gather 'round the target.

27:30.275 --> 27:31.317
- All right.
- (groaning)

27:31.484 --> 27:33.153
Maybe we can cut through
the abandoned wing

27:33.319 --> 27:35.029
and we can get
to the ambulance bay that way.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.114
Might take some time, but...

27:36.281 --> 27:37.740
Oh, if only there were
two able-bodied men

27:37.907 --> 27:38.867
who could buy us some.

27:39.033 --> 27:41.369
And why, pray tell, should we
risk our necks for you?

27:41.536 --> 27:42.453
(straining):
Chivalry?

27:42.620 --> 27:43.955
Flaughs)

27:44.205 --> 27:46.124
But if that's too much,
remember, if I die,

27:46.291 --> 27:48.084
you will never find
that sub part.

27:48.251 --> 27:49.043
Fine.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.212
We'll keep them busy.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.839
We'll meet you at the docks.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.132
Thank you.

27:59.262 --> 28:00.889
- What?
- Keep them busy?

28:01.097 --> 28:03.558
I only brought enough ammunition
for a light firefight,

28:03.766 --> 28:06.227
not to repel
a paramilitary assault.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.479
What should we use,
bedpans?

28:09.272 --> 28:10.190
I was actually thinking
of something

28:10.398 --> 28:13.067
a little more...
flammable.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.445
<i>N' N'</i>

28:16.070 --> 28:17.739
(both laugh)

28:31.336 --> 28:32.378
(grunts)

28:48.770 --> 28:51.898
Why, Captain Gordon,
how nice that you're awake.

28:52.857 --> 28:55.151
You picked
the losing side, Strange.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.489
The army's coming
to Gotham. Help me,

28:59.656 --> 29:01.407
and you can do
what you do best:

29:01.866 --> 29:03.034
survive.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.745
I happen to think more

29:05.912 --> 29:08.331
of Ms. al Ghul's chances
for success

29:08.498 --> 29:09.958
than a man in your...

29:10.333 --> 29:11.292
well...

29:12.043 --> 29:13.253
position.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.714
You really think
she can take on the entire army?

29:16.923 --> 29:18.633
As a matter
of fact, I do.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.469
With my help.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.682
You are just
a few modifications away

29:25.848 --> 29:28.559
from being a mighty soldier
in her forces.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.854
Not unlike
your friend, Eduardo...

29:32.563 --> 29:36.150
I will help you to realize
your full potential,

29:36.526 --> 29:39.404
give you true strength.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.155
I'll pass.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.241
<i>Consent is hardly</i>

29:43.408 --> 29:44.951
a prerequisite.

29:45.576 --> 29:48.246
We will begin...

29:49.414 --> 29:51.332
with, uh, physical improvements.

29:51.499 --> 29:52.667
(groans softly)

29:55.420 --> 29:56.421
Sorry.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.965
And finish...

30:00.300 --> 30:03.970
with certain mental adjustments.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.558
(elevator bell dings)

30:09.058 --> 30:10.685
(rasping)

30:24.824 --> 30:26.743
(cheers)

30:29.037 --> 30:31.164
(Bane rasping)

30:50.433 --> 30:51.809
Your contractions are
about a minute apart.

30:51.976 --> 30:53.186
We've got to get you
out of here.

30:53.603 --> 30:54.479
(screams)

30:54.687 --> 30:55.396
(grunts)

30:55.563 --> 30:57.899
(pained yelling)

30:58.608 --> 30:59.859
Nice shot!

31:01.277 --> 31:02.820
(yelling)

31:05.156 --> 31:06.032
Keep breathing.

31:06.199 --> 31:07.241
(panting)

31:37.021 --> 31:37.897
(grunts quietly)

31:55.289 --> 31:57.250
<i>N' N'</i>

32:05.425 --> 32:06.509
(panting softly)

32:06.676 --> 32:08.094
Some try to hide,
some try to cheat.

32:08.261 --> 32:09.887
- (sighs) - But time
will let us always meet.

32:10.054 --> 32:11.222
What am I?

32:11.806 --> 32:13.433
- Pregnant lady with a gun?
- Death.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.684
But close enough.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.770
So, where to now?

32:18.187 --> 32:19.564
Well, I believe...

32:20.356 --> 32:21.983
we have a sub to catch.

32:22.275 --> 32:25.069
- (chuckles)
- How long have you had that?

32:25.236 --> 32:26.821
Long enough to know she'd never
let it out of her sight.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.407
Flaughs)

32:32.452 --> 32:34.328
And you stuck around long enough

32:34.704 --> 32:37.915
to risk both of our lives
to save Barbara's?

32:40.460 --> 32:41.669
Or was it to protect Lee?

32:42.420 --> 32:44.672
Do you want me to answer that or
do you want sail away from here?

32:45.673 --> 32:46.841
Bon voyage.

32:53.514 --> 32:56.392
Oh, those bastards have
stolen the damn sub part!

32:56.559 --> 32:57.602
You mean, stole it back.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.562
Whose side are you on?

32:59.729 --> 33:01.481
Clearly,
I'm on the baby's side, Barbara.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.275
- Ooh!
- What was your plan, anyway?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.737
You were going to be a fugitive
with Nygma and Penguin?

33:07.904 --> 33:10.740
Well, I'm not exactly the stay-
at-home-and-bake-apple-pie type.

33:10.948 --> 33:14.076
Yeah, running off on a submarine
seemed like a great alternative.

33:18.581 --> 33:22.919
Barbara, you can live here.
You can have this baby here.

33:23.294 --> 33:25.421
Jim is not taking
the baby away from you.

33:27.381 --> 33:28.841
You really believe that?

33:30.009 --> 33:32.261
You really think
Captain Jim Gordon

33:32.428 --> 33:34.889
is gonna let a criminal
raise his kid?

33:39.936 --> 33:41.687
People are already
shooting at my baby.

33:42.563 --> 33:43.898
I have to protect him...

33:44.941 --> 33:45.733
or her.

33:46.526 --> 33:47.985
I have to be strong.

33:49.111 --> 33:52.281
Right, being strong does not
mean you have to be a criminal.

33:54.492 --> 33:55.493
Jim will help you.

33:57.411 --> 33:58.871
And so will I if you'll let me.

33:59.747 --> 34:00.915
Well, that's just weird.

34:01.582 --> 34:02.416
I know.

34:03.334 --> 34:05.628
Hey,baby,
this is your Auntie Lee.

34:05.962 --> 34:07.547
Mommy tried to kill her once,
maybe twice.

34:07.713 --> 34:08.965
- (both laugh)
- All right.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.007
Okay, that's enough of that.

34:10.174 --> 34:11.717
Come on. We got to keep moving.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.012
I think this is happening now.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.433
(screams)

34:19.600 --> 34:21.310
(panting)

34:25.565 --> 34:27.440
(panting)

34:35.491 --> 34:36.951
(whimpers softly)

34:40.746 --> 34:41.621
(screams)

34:41.789 --> 34:43.081
<i>SOLDIER:
What's going on in there?</i>

34:45.042 --> 34:45.918
(yells)

34:54.594 --> 34:56.429
This is Bruce Wayne.
Can anyone read me?

34:59.724 --> 35:00.474
(grunts)

35:01.475 --> 35:04.061
This is Bruce Wayne.
Does anyone at the GCPD read me?

35:05.605 --> 35:07.565
<i>This is Bruce Wayne.
Can anyone read me?</i>

35:08.566 --> 35:11.068
Bruce, it's Alfred. Where
the devil are you? Over.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.946
Some abandoned mansion
in North Side Park.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.114
- On my way.
- No.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.365
I'll get out myself.

35:16.574 --> 35:17.783
I need you to get to the clinic.

35:17.992 --> 35:18.743
The clinic?

35:18.909 --> 35:20.620
<i>It's Ra's al Ghul's
daughter, Alfred.</i>

35:21.245 --> 35:23.914
<i>She wants revenge.
She mutated Eduardo Dorrance</i>

35:24.081 --> 35:25.291
and sent him after Barbara.

35:25.458 --> 35:26.584
Oh, gosh.

35:27.209 --> 35:28.336
I'm fine.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.089
I need you to get
to Barbara and the baby.

35:33.799 --> 35:37.011
Now, you're going to feel
a slight discomfort.

35:37.261 --> 35:40.556
That's the stimulant I've given
you to prepare your muscles.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.601
<i>You'll need it for
what comes next, which,</i>

35:44.935 --> 35:47.730
I'm afraid, is going
to be excruciating.

35:50.274 --> 35:52.693
(machine whirring)

35:52.860 --> 35:56.197
(grunts)

35:58.991 --> 36:00.785
Do you feel that?

36:02.203 --> 36:03.287
Yes.

36:07.708 --> 36:10.336
(Gordon groans)

36:11.671 --> 36:12.421
(grunts)

36:21.639 --> 36:24.100
There's that fighting spirit

36:24.266 --> 36:26.602
I've always admired so much.

36:26.769 --> 36:27.937
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

36:28.270 --> 36:30.022
there's an alarm I must sound.

36:30.272 --> 36:31.065
(grunts)

36:33.526 --> 36:34.985
(panting)

36:37.613 --> 36:38.781
(grunts)

36:41.158 --> 36:43.119
- What the hell are you doing?
- Checking to make sure

36:43.285 --> 36:45.496
Strange doesn't have one of
those chips in your head.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.540
We need to hurry up,

36:47.707 --> 36:49.250
get out of here
before he trips the alarm.

36:49.417 --> 36:51.711
(alarm blaring)

36:51.877 --> 36:52.878
Come on.

36:58.592 --> 36:59.719
Alfred and GCPD are on their way

36:59.885 --> 37:01.178
- to the clinic.
- Where's Nyssa?

37:01.429 --> 37:02.388
<i>I don't know.</i>

37:03.097 --> 37:05.141
But she's planning on using
the military to wipe out Gotham.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.268
I can order them to stand down.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.395
Then let's get you
out of here.

37:17.570 --> 37:18.821
THOMPKINS:
She's beautiful.

37:19.155 --> 37:20.489
Congratulations.

37:21.615 --> 37:22.575
Hi, there.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.536
Guess I'm-a have figure out
what to call you.

37:25.703 --> 37:28.122
- (chuckles softly)
- (sniffles)

37:28.748 --> 37:29.623
Thank you.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.931
(baby crying)

37:50.936 --> 37:52.980
- (Thompkins gasps)
- (tires screech)

37:55.191 --> 37:57.318
- Come on.
- Get in the car now.

37:57.860 --> 37:58.778
I'll hold him off.

37:59.153 --> 38:00.321
<i>SEUNA:

38:01.572 --> 38:02.615
<i>ALFRED:

38:03.157 --> 38:04.950
<i>- Selina, get back in the car!
- No.</i>

38:05.493 --> 38:06.243
Go.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.621
Oh, my, look at you.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.289
You're a big'un, ain't you?

38:11.165 --> 38:12.833
Bloody baby bully,
let's see what you got.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.794
(grunting)

38:26.639 --> 38:28.140
(grunting)

38:32.978 --> 38:34.522
Dirty bastard.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.316
(Alfred screams)

38:46.992 --> 38:50.079
(grunting)

38:52.623 --> 38:53.624
No!

38:55.209 --> 38:56.210
Alfred.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.421
Alfred.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.760
(whispers):
Alfred. No.

39:05.553 --> 39:07.054
Somebody help!

39:07.471 --> 39:09.014

39:09.139 --> 39:11.267
Somebody. Oh, no.

to the mainland now.

Jim! Hey.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.512
Just got word from Lee.

39:49.346 --> 39:51.432
She and Barbara made it
out of the clinic okay.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.893
And your baby daughter, too.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.148
- Congratulations.
- They're going to The Sirens.

40:00.774 --> 40:03.527
- You just had a baby girl, brother.
Say something. -flaughs)

40:10.701 --> 40:12.202
Just can't believe it.

40:12.870 --> 40:14.455
We won, didn't we? It's over.

40:14.663 --> 40:17.541
We did, and she's gonna have
a better world because of it.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.960
She is. I promise.

40:20.711 --> 40:21.462
Is Alfred with them?

40:21.629 --> 40:22.630
Didn't say.

40:23.547 --> 40:25.215
This is General Wade.

40:26.592 --> 40:30.137
I am authorizing
Special Order 386.

40:30.763 --> 40:31.472
No!

40:31.639 --> 40:33.891
Gotham City is lost.

40:34.058 --> 40:35.851
Begin your bombing
run on my order.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.770
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Arrest them.

40:39.647 --> 40:40.981
You can't do this.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.274
Take them away.

40:42.816 --> 40:44.151
You can't do this!

40:48.113 --> 40:49.365
THOMPKINS:
Okay, nice and slow.

40:51.325 --> 40:53.243
(baby fussing)

40:55.537 --> 40:56.664
(gasps)

41:05.756 --> 41:07.800
- Barbara Kean.
- Run!

41:12.763 --> 41:14.974
It's nice to finally meet you.

41:16.183 --> 41:18.602
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

41:21.188 --> 41:23.524
I believe you knew my father.

41:29.947 --> 41:31.490
I don't understand how the
general could have been chipped.

41:31.657 --> 41:33.534
I didn't see a scar on the
back of his neck. Did you?

41:33.909 --> 41:35.452
No. Strange must've hidden it.

41:35.619 --> 41:38.288
Nyssa let us escape. She knew
we'd bring the general here

41:38.455 --> 41:39.832
and do her dirty work for her.

41:45.504 --> 41:46.380
BULLOCK:
What now, Jim?

41:46.547 --> 41:49.633
Son, if you're gonna stick a gun
in my face,

41:49.883 --> 41:52.678
you should at least know
you're doing it wrong.

41:56.056 --> 41:57.474
Come on, let's go.

41:57.641 --> 41:59.560
(helicopter blades whirring)

42:08.569 --> 42:12.906
