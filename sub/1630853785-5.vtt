<i>this competition fascinating.</i>

Hey, how's it going?

11:21.314 --> 11:22.716
Damn right. Oh!

11:22.749 --> 11:24.451
Oh, hey, you guys like
bicycles?

11:24.484 --> 11:25.852
- Whoo.
- Hey, all right.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.887
Yeah! Oh, nice.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.889

11:29.923 --> 11:31.558
Hey, could you do me a favor?
- I'll hold it. I'll hold it.

- Oh, I appreciate it.
Thank you.

11:32.659 --> 11:33.993

I got you.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.562
I got you, brother.

11:40.767 --> 11:41.968
What is your name?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.170
- I am Keegan,
the bicycle comedian.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.972
- Okay.
- Uh-oh.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.707
- Well, you know,
Simon loves bikes.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.775
- Oh, is that right?

11:48.808 --> 11:50.210
- Do you wear a helmet
like that?

11:50.243 --> 11:53.913
- No, because they don't look
great, do they?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.548
- What?

11:55.582 --> 11:58.318
- Keegan, how old are you?
Where are you from?

11:58.351 --> 12:01.187
- I am 39 years old
from Chicago.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.190
- And why are you here
on "AGT"?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.658
- I've done stand-up
for ten years.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.360
- Wow.
- I feel like I have

12:07.394 --> 12:09.095
something unique to bring.
- Okay.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.897
- So you think you can win
the million dollars?

12:10.930 --> 12:12.799

- And you want to go to Vegas?

12:12.832 --> 12:13.800

- Okay.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.235
So let's see what you've got.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.538
- All right.
[cheers and applause]

12:21.875 --> 12:25.211
Went on a date recently.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.579
She goes, "What do you do?"

12:26.613 --> 12:28.081
I go, "Like, I'm a comedian,

12:28.114 --> 12:31.451

only about bicycles.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.388

12:45.899 --> 12:47.233
All right, okay, you ever see

12:47.267 --> 12:48.868
those old bikes
with the banana seat?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.670
I think they're making
a comeback.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.238
I've been seeing a bunch.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.908
[buzzer blares]

12:54.941 --> 12:56.109
Okay.
- [groans]

12:56.142 --> 12:58.211

kind of bicycle?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.713

12:59.746 --> 13:03.116
You know my favorite star?
Trek.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.852
Give me a break.
Give me a break.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.554
It's been a rough week, okay?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.723
This guy tried selling me
a stolen bike.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.825
I'm like, "Hey, no peddling."

13:11.858 --> 13:13.393
- Ooh.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.362
[buzzer blares]

13:16.062 --> 13:18.098
- It's over.
- Aw.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.333
These are top-notch bike jokes.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.069
- Oh, your thing
is bad jokes.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.472
- No, no, bike jokes.
- [laughs]

13:25.505 --> 13:26.740
- We still have to vote,

13:26.773 --> 13:28.675
but I know it's gonna be no.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.176
Howie?
- It's a no for me.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.311
- No. Heidi, no.
- No.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.214
- Me, no. Simon?
- See you later.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.082
Take care.
- All right.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.085
- And off into the sunset
he rides.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.887
That man got a helmet
and gloves

13:40.920 --> 13:42.355
and decided he had an act.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.425
<i>- Why would you wait in line</i>
<i>all day long to do that?</i>

13:45.458 --> 13:48.094
<i>- You need more than one joke</i>
<i>to create an act.</i>

13:49.629 --> 13:51.965
- My name is Mr. Pants.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.467
<i>And I will be performing jokes</i>

13:54.501 --> 13:56.770

13:56.803 --> 13:58.705
Hello, Simon.
[buzzer blares]

13:58.738 --> 14:01.074
<i>I've had many jobs,</i>

14:01.107 --> 14:02.842

comedy chose me.

Terry, I'm going home.
- Okay. [chuckles]

14:05.812 --> 14:08.748
- But stand-up comedy
is a very difficult path.

<i>So to be able to perform</i>

your socks off.

14:35.909 --> 14:36.876

14:36.910 --> 14:38.812
- Hello, everybody.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.580
- Nice to meet you
and what's your name?

14:40.613 --> 14:42.282
- My name is Mr. Pants.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.184
- Mr. Pants,
I don't know how to say it,

14:44.217 --> 14:46.519
but your fly is open
and something is poking out.

14:46.553 --> 14:50.156

14:50.190 --> 14:51.257
- Is that your real name?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.292
- Yes.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.993
- What, Mr. Pants?
- Mr. Pants.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.363
Can we get a Q-tip
for Simon over here?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.597
It's Mr. Pants.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.532
- [laughs]
- Okay, Mr. Pants,

14:59.566 --> 15:01.067
tell me where you're from.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.403
- Brooklyn, New York.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.704
- What is your day job?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.673
- Well, I used to go
to the office every day,

15:06.706 --> 15:08.108
but since the pandemic,

15:08.141 --> 15:10.076
I've been virtually replaced
by sweatpants.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.046
- Okay. Okay.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.815
You're a comedian?
- Sir, yes, sir.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.118
I'm here to dazzle you with
my stand-up comedy routine.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.787
- So what's the dream,
Mr. Pants.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.056
- Vegas, baby.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.924
- Okay, I'm not gonna ask
any more questions.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.060
It's a complete waste of time.
Good luck.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.261
- Thank you.
[both chuckle]

15:28.294 --> 15:29.963
- Be right back.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.905
- Ladies and gentlemen...
[both laugh]

15:38.938 --> 15:40.840
- Mr. Pants.

15:40.874 --> 15:44.344
[cheers and applause]

15:44.377 --> 15:46.846
- Please, Terry,
my father was Mr. Pants.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.149
[laughter]

15:49.182 --> 15:50.417
Look, I'm gonna make
this brief.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.452
I only got one day left
on my return policy.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.591
I inherited my father's
"jeans."

16:00.527 --> 16:03.697
He emigrated here
from a Banana Republic.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.766
He was very hard
on me growing up.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.035
He used to call me
a huge "waist."

16:09.035 --> 16:11.438
- [chuckles]

16:11.471 --> 16:14.474
- You see, both of my parents
wanted me to become a lawyer.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.109
Never even came close
to becoming a lawyer,

16:16.142 --> 16:18.545
but I was once involved
in a "suit."

16:18.578 --> 16:21.781
[laughter]

16:21.815 --> 16:23.516
But I've since traveled
the world.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.684
Went to Spain,

16:24.718 --> 16:27.587
fell madly in love
with a Spanish sundress.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.789
[laughter]

16:29.823 --> 16:32.425
Then we broke up
and I was <i>"pant-alones."</i>

16:32.459 --> 16:34.427
- [laughs]

16:34.461 --> 16:35.562

16:35.595 --> 16:37.163
[applause]

16:37.197 --> 16:38.398
- I love him.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.600
- But I'm happily married now.
- Aw.

16:40.633 --> 16:44.371
[laughter]

16:44.404 --> 16:46.239
My wife and I are poly.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.508
That's polyester.
- Oh.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.644
[laughter]

16:51.678 --> 16:53.613
- Our daughter Capri...

16:53.646 --> 16:55.615
- [applauds]

16:55.648 --> 16:58.985
- Brought home a pair
of sweatpants.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.187
Hey, I want to be
a supportive father,

17:01.221 --> 17:02.389
but I want to see
her date someone

17:02.422 --> 17:03.757
ironed with a crease.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.526
This guy looked
like he'd been donated.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.162
[laughter]

17:09.195 --> 17:10.497
She asked if he could spend
the night, I said,

17:10.530 --> 17:13.033
"In my house, you'll sleep
in separate drawers."

17:13.033 --> 17:15.135
- [laughs]

17:15.168 --> 17:16.536
- Hey, guys, I'd love
to tell you more jokes,

17:16.569 --> 17:18.872
but unfortunately,
I left them in my other pants.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.540
[laughter]

17:20.573 --> 17:21.675
Thank you so much.

really annoying.

you were very funny.

a loop pedal

21:33.660 --> 21:35.095
This is what a loop pedal does.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.731
- So you record
each individual sound yourself

21:37.764 --> 21:40.533
and then it plays on a loop
and hopefully it comes together

21:40.567 --> 21:42.002

52:16.102 --> 52:21.174
- Yah.
- Yah.

52:22.475 --> 52:26.179
- * With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride *

52:26.212 --> 52:28.548
- * Your toxic,
I'm slipping under *

52:28.581 --> 52:31.751
* With a taste
of a poison paradise *

52:31.785 --> 52:33.153
* I'm addicted to you *

52:33.186 --> 52:35.488
* Don't you know
that you're toxic? *

52:39.826 --> 52:42.862
[cheers and applause]

52:43.396 --> 52:45.565
- I love it!
- I'm with you.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.735
Oh, my God.
- [speaks indistinctly]

52:48.768 --> 52:50.737
<i>* *</i>

52:50.770 --> 52:52.405
- Oh, my God.

52:52.439 --> 52:55.775
- I love how Simon doesn't like
my high-pitched angel voice,

52:55.809 --> 52:57.377
but that he loves.

52:57.410 --> 53:00.613
- This is another unexpected
thing today, eh?

53:00.647 --> 53:01.881
- Yeah, very.

53:01.915 --> 53:03.917
- You won't be singing
"Oh, Happy Day" will you?

53:03.950 --> 53:05.585
<i>- * Oh, happy day *</i>

53:05.618 --> 53:09.589
- It was like demons in a choir

53:09.622 --> 53:11.524
singing the song
from "The Omen,"

53:11.558 --> 53:13.760
then going into Britney Spears.

53:13.793 --> 53:18.298
It was so fantastically creepy.
[both chuckle]

53:18.331 --> 53:21.468
- But I'm all for going over
to the dark side occasionally,

53:21.501 --> 53:23.169
so I get it.
- Whoo!

53:23.203 --> 53:24.404
- Whoo.
- Yeah!

53:24.437 --> 53:25.672
- You too?
- Yeah.

53:25.705 --> 53:27.273
- Thank you.
- Sofía?

53:27.307 --> 53:29.442
- Well, I thought it was
so unexpected.

53:29.476 --> 53:31.111
I thought this was gonna be
super boring.

53:31.144 --> 53:32.479
I was dreading it.

53:32.512 --> 53:34.247
But then suddenly,

53:34.280 --> 53:36.082
I was, like,
in some kind of movies

53:36.082 --> 53:40.153
with dragons or vampires
or something.

53:40.186 --> 53:43.256
But it was very spectacular
and creative.

53:43.289 --> 53:45.792
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

53:45.825 --> 53:46.893
- As you can see,

53:46.926 --> 53:48.795
I'm the odd one out here
on this table.

53:48.828 --> 53:51.097
- I didn't particularly
love it.

53:51.097 --> 53:53.700
I don't think that people
necessarily would buy

53:53.733 --> 53:55.168
a ticket to come
and watch this.

53:55.201 --> 53:56.536
- But what about on Halloween?

53:56.569 --> 54:00.674
People love demons,
and vampires, and werewolves.

54:01.741 --> 54:03.076
- Whoo.

54:03.109 --> 54:04.544
- [growls]

54:05.745 --> 54:07.447
- Oh, ho, ho.

54:07.480 --> 54:08.515
- It's a bit normal

54:08.548 --> 54:09.683
that you're surprised
to see us,

54:09.716 --> 54:12.052
because we are
the only metal choir

54:12.085 --> 54:13.086
in the world.
- Whoa.

54:13.119 --> 54:14.187
- This is the first time
in history

54:14.220 --> 54:15.321
- Wow.

54:17.424 --> 54:19.826
- I love it.
I didn't know you even existed.

54:19.859 --> 54:22.595
And I'm so thrilled
that I think you're opening

54:22.629 --> 54:25.565
the eyes and ears of America
on our stage.

54:25.598 --> 54:26.566
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

54:26.599 --> 54:28.234
- Thanks.

54:28.268 --> 54:29.402
- Do you want to start voting?

54:29.436 --> 54:30.837
- Well, absolutely.

54:30.870 --> 54:32.105
It's original.

54:32.138 --> 54:34.307
I wasn't expecting that,
so I want to give you

54:34.341 --> 54:36.209
your first yes.

54:36.242 --> 54:38.578
- Thank you so much.
- Whoo!

54:38.611 --> 54:40.146
- I'm gonna give you
your second yes.

54:40.180 --> 54:42.816
That was spectacular.
- Whoo!

54:42.849 --> 54:44.217
- Please don't take it
personal,

54:44.250 --> 54:46.252
but the act was not for me.
It's a no for me.

54:46.286 --> 54:49.155
- It's fine.

54:49.189 --> 54:51.925
- The queen of Halloween
gave you a no.

54:51.958 --> 54:53.526
Nothing thrills me more

54:53.560 --> 54:55.729
than to give you
your third yes.

54:55.762 --> 54:58.832
[cheers and applause]

55:01.634 --> 55:03.103
- [growls]

55:03.136 --> 55:05.839
- Thank you.
Thank you.

55:08.108 --> 55:09.309
- It was so different.

55:09.342 --> 55:10.944
- They could come back
dressed as monsters

55:11.044 --> 55:12.045
in the next round.

55:12.045 --> 55:14.047
- Tell me how to do it.
[growls]

55:14.047 --> 55:16.282
- Yeah, you--
[all growl]

55:17.417 --> 55:18.852
<i>- Coming up...</i>

55:18.885 --> 55:21.321
- The crowd is going crazy
for you.

55:21.354 --> 55:23.456
- I paid them all to do that,
so that was...

55:23.490 --> 55:25.392
- Immediately
I fell in love with you,

55:25.425 --> 55:27.193
so I'm gonna do this.

55:27.227 --> 55:28.928
[buzzer blares]

55:34.701 --> 55:35.735
<i>- Welcome</i>

55:35.769 --> 55:36.903

55:36.936 --> 55:38.271
- We're dancers.

55:38.304 --> 55:40.674

55:40.707 --> 55:41.675

55:41.708 --> 55:42.842
<i>- Can we get the next act</i>

55:42.876 --> 55:44.544
<i>to the side of the stage,</i>
<i>please?</i>

55:44.577 --> 55:46.279
<i>- There's a lot of people.</i>

55:46.312 --> 55:48.081
<i>- A lot of nervous people.</i>

55:48.081 --> 55:50.517
<i>- 75, head below.</i>

55:50.550 --> 55:52.485
<i>- * I can do anything *</i>

55:52.519 --> 55:55.088
- That 90 seconds
could change your life.

55:55.121 --> 55:57.157
<i>- Now's the time</i>
<i>for me to do something.</i>

55:57.190 --> 55:59.492
- Now I'm finally here
in front of the world.

55:59.526 --> 56:01.594
<i>- And here we are.</i>

56:01.628 --> 56:05.331
<i>- * I'm not ever coming down *</i>

56:05.365 --> 56:06.666
<i>- All right,</i>
<i>here we go, folks.</i>

56:06.700 --> 56:08.068
<i>- What is the ultimate dream?</i>

56:08.101 --> 56:10.403
<i>- I'll just show them</i>
<i>the inside of my soul.</i>

56:10.437 --> 56:12.072
- You think it's gonna be you?

56:12.105 --> 56:13.907
- [sighs] I hope so.

56:13.940 --> 56:15.375
- And when I call
the next number,

56:15.408 --> 56:16.743
you guys are gonna stand up.

56:16.776 --> 56:18.044
<i>- * Up in the air *</i>

56:18.044 --> 56:23.216
<i>* I'm walking on gold rays *</i>

56:23.249 --> 56:26.619
<i>* I'm going up *</i>

56:26.653 --> 56:27.721
- How are you?

56:27.754 --> 56:29.055
- I'm doing pretty good.

56:29.089 --> 56:30.056
How are you?
- Good.

56:30.090 --> 56:31.157
Yeah, great, thank you.

56:31.191 --> 56:32.959
Uh, what's your name, please?

56:33.059 --> 56:36.129
- My name is Lily Meola.
I'm a singer-songwriter.

56:36.162 --> 56:37.397
- Okay.
And how old are you?

56:37.430 --> 56:39.933
- I'm 27.
- And what makes you different

56:39.966 --> 56:42.168
from all the thousands
of other people trying to get,

56:42.202 --> 56:44.771
you know,
noticed at the moment?

56:44.804 --> 56:46.840
- The song I'm gonna do today
is an original song

56:46.873 --> 56:49.309
that I wrote
and it's called "Daydream."

56:49.342 --> 56:55.081
And it's kind of evolved
over the past couple of years,

56:55.081 --> 56:56.883
the meaning of it for me.

56:56.916 --> 56:58.084
- Which is?

56:58.118 --> 57:00.787
- I wrote it
at a time in my life

57:00.820 --> 57:03.023
when things were
really beautiful.

57:03.023 --> 57:06.393
And I was essentially living
my daydream.

57:06.426 --> 57:09.229
I had a major label
record deal.

57:09.262 --> 57:11.664
I had a publishing deal.

57:11.698 --> 57:13.767
I had butterflies
I was hatching.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.237
It was just--it was magical.
It was just so beautiful.

57:17.270 --> 57:22.809
And I wanted other people
to be able to feel that.

57:22.842 --> 57:25.145
And so that's
where it originated.

57:25.178 --> 57:28.281
And then my life
flipped upside down,

57:28.314 --> 57:31.885
and my mom was diagnosed
with cancer.

57:31.918 --> 57:34.320
And I became
her full-time caretaker.

57:34.354 --> 57:36.923
I lost my record deal
during that,

57:36.956 --> 57:40.260
but I think maybe it was
a bit of a blessing,

57:40.293 --> 57:42.562
'cause it gave me
some extra time

57:42.595 --> 57:44.898
to really be there for her.

57:44.931 --> 57:46.066
[exhales sharply]

57:46.099 --> 57:48.368
- Is she okay?

57:48.401 --> 57:50.804
- No, she passed away.
- I'm sorry, Lily.

57:52.706 --> 57:54.507
- It's okay.
[laughs]

57:54.541 --> 57:56.376
I really told myself
I wasn't gonna cry.

57:56.409 --> 57:58.411
Um--
- That's all right.

57:58.445 --> 58:00.146
- Um, she was
my biggest cheerleader

58:00.180 --> 58:02.282
and...[sighs]

58:03.783 --> 58:07.754
- Lily, I have to ask you this,

58:07.787 --> 58:10.590
are you okay to do
this audition?

58:10.623 --> 58:12.792
- I don't know
how I'm gonna be able

58:12.826 --> 58:17.263
to make it through a song
without crying--[chuckles]

58:17.297 --> 58:20.467
But, you know,
singing was something

58:20.500 --> 58:23.536
my mom and I
really connected with.

58:23.570 --> 58:27.607
And it's how I fell in love
with music in the first place,

58:27.640 --> 58:28.775
her playing music in the car.

58:28.808 --> 58:31.845
So I'm just trying
to make her proud.

58:31.878 --> 58:35.782
And...continue to live
my daydream.

58:35.815 --> 58:37.717
- Good for you.
- Good for you!

58:37.751 --> 58:40.854
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo.

58:44.457 --> 58:45.558
- Okay, well, best of luck.

58:45.592 --> 58:46.960
We're rooting for you, Lily.

you have a beautiful voice.

And I could feel the emotion.

1:01:30.090 --> 1:01:31.391
And, you know, you told us
the story

1:01:31.424 --> 1:01:34.828
before you the song
about this time in your life

1:01:34.861 --> 1:01:38.331
when things were perfect
and you hatched butterflies.

1:01:39.599 --> 1:01:41.768
And this moment right now,

1:01:41.801 --> 1:01:46.106
you are that butterfly
on the way.

1:01:46.106 --> 1:01:49.576

was watching you tonight.

1:01:52.712 --> 1:01:55.415
And the way you were, like,
feeling what you were doing,

1:01:55.448 --> 1:01:57.584
that what it was so special
about your performance.

1:01:57.617 --> 1:02:00.754
And I really enjoyed that song.

1:02:00.787 --> 1:02:02.722
- But you didn't--
you didn't put anything out

1:02:02.756 --> 1:02:03.723
when you had a deal?

1:02:03.757 --> 1:02:05.425
- No.
- You didn't.

1:02:05.458 --> 1:02:08.361
Okay, so you've never really
tested the waters, have you?

1:02:08.395 --> 1:02:09.429
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.

1:02:09.462 --> 1:02:10.964

1:02:11.064 --> 1:02:12.599
yeah, this was my first time
putting music out

1:02:12.632 --> 1:02:13.767

You know, everything
you've been through

1:02:21.675 --> 1:02:23.209
you told us about.
You know, and I'm sure

1:02:23.243 --> 1:02:25.211
those memories came
flooding back to you

1:02:25.245 --> 1:02:27.347
during that audition,
and you're thinking,

1:02:27.380 --> 1:02:29.482
"I've still gotta get
through the song."

1:02:29.516 --> 1:02:32.585
And I know you've gone through
a very difficult period.

1:02:32.619 --> 1:02:34.354
I think the fact
that you've come back

1:02:34.387 --> 1:02:35.689
after what you've gone through,

1:02:35.722 --> 1:02:37.824
that says a lot about you,
Lily, so good for you.

1:02:39.092 --> 1:02:40.226
- Bravo.

1:02:40.260 --> 1:02:43.296
[cheers and applause]

1:02:45.098 --> 1:02:46.132
- I don't know what to say.

1:02:46.166 --> 1:02:47.701
I'm, like, speechless,
you know?

1:02:47.734 --> 1:02:50.003
Like, sometimes you have
someone on the stage

1:02:50.103 --> 1:02:52.105
and you hear their voice--

1:02:52.105 --> 1:02:54.741
And just everything about you,
you just light up.

1:02:54.774 --> 1:02:56.609
I see a light around you.
And I don't know, I--

1:02:56.643 --> 1:02:58.411
like, immediately
I fell in love with you.

1:02:58.445 --> 1:03:01.748
And for this season,
season 17, I was like,

1:03:01.781 --> 1:03:03.483
"There's always a lot
of singers on the stage."

1:03:03.516 --> 1:03:04.751
And I was like,

1:03:04.784 --> 1:03:06.519
"I want to give
someone else a shot."

1:03:06.553 --> 1:03:07.754
But I can't help it,

1:03:07.787 --> 1:03:08.822
'cause I really, really
like you.

1:03:08.855 --> 1:03:10.490
So I'm gonna do this.

- I'm from Garden Grove,
California.

1:05:53.186 --> 1:05:57.123
- And you came here to dance?
- No.

1:05:57.157 --> 1:05:59.426
I actually came here to do
stand-up comedy.

1:05:59.459 --> 1:06:03.096

1:06:07.067 --> 1:06:09.636

- Jordan, how long
have you been a comedian?

1:06:12.205 --> 1:06:13.606
- I've been doing it
for seven years now.

1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:14.641
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:06:14.674 --> 1:06:16.109
- And that's how you make
a living?

1:06:16.142 --> 1:06:18.445
- I--I would like to say yes,

1:06:18.478 --> 1:06:21.281
but also, do you want
your fries with more ketchup?

1:06:21.314 --> 1:06:22.716
You know what I mean?
Like, does that make sense?

1:06:22.749 --> 1:06:25.385
Okay, I just wanted to confirm.
That's--so yeah.

1:06:25.418 --> 1:06:26.753

discourage you,

1:06:26.786 --> 1:06:28.822

- Oh, yeah.

1:06:28.855 --> 1:06:31.191
Oh, yeah.
[cheers and applause]

1:06:31.224 --> 1:06:33.693
[chuckles]
- So what is your dream?

1:06:33.727 --> 1:06:36.529
What--where do you see yourself
in the future?

1:06:36.563 --> 1:06:38.231
- I have very, very big dreams.

1:06:38.264 --> 1:06:41.167
So my dream right now
is all based off of Kevin Hart.

1:06:41.201 --> 1:06:42.969
Kevin Hart did
a football stadium

1:06:43.069 --> 1:06:44.938
I think with, like,
73,000 people.

1:06:44.971 --> 1:06:48.808
My goal is 73,001.

1:06:48.842 --> 1:06:51.878
[cheers and applause]

1:06:52.545 --> 1:06:54.814
- Wow. That's ambition.

1:06:54.848 --> 1:06:57.217
- Okay, so let's see
what you've got.

1:06:57.250 --> 1:06:59.085
- Okay, thank you.

1:07:06.726 --> 1:07:09.796
So I come
from a very tough upbringing.

1:07:09.829 --> 1:07:11.431
Like, I have a military family.

1:07:11.464 --> 1:07:14.734
My parents met
in the Marine Corps.

1:07:14.768 --> 1:07:17.437
Like, that's
where my parents met, right?

1:07:17.470 --> 1:07:18.805
Like, my dad came to me,
he was like,

1:07:18.838 --> 1:07:19.939
"Yo, it'd be so cool

1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:22.208
if my oldest son
could join the military."

1:07:22.242 --> 1:07:24.144
I was like,
"Dad, it'd be so cool

1:07:24.177 --> 1:07:26.479
if you adopted somebody
older than me, yeah."

1:07:26.513 --> 1:07:28.348
- [chuckles]
- I'm--[chuckles]

1:07:28.381 --> 1:07:29.616
I'm not that guy.
I feel like,

1:07:29.649 --> 1:07:31.384
if you're gonna go overseas,

1:07:31.418 --> 1:07:33.953
you need to be willing
to take secrets to the grave.

1:07:34.054 --> 1:07:36.122
I'm not that guy, okay?
You know what I mean?

1:07:36.156 --> 1:07:38.224
Like--like, if I go overseas--

1:07:38.258 --> 1:07:39.292
let's say I get captured.

1:07:39.325 --> 1:07:40.560
I become a prisoner of war.

1:07:40.593 --> 1:07:41.861
I'm telling my secrets,
your secrets,

1:07:41.895 --> 1:07:43.430
and Victoria's secrets.
You know what I'm saying?

1:07:43.463 --> 1:07:45.932
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]

1:07:45.965 --> 1:07:47.834
I'm telling them all.

1:07:47.867 --> 1:07:49.669
Like, I could be
in a hostage situation

1:07:49.703 --> 1:07:51.104
and this guy's trying
to threaten me.

1:07:51.137 --> 1:07:52.906
He's like,
"What's it gonna take

1:07:52.939 --> 1:07:54.407
to get these secrets from you?"

1:07:54.441 --> 1:07:56.343
I'm like,
"Sir, a pen and paper.

1:07:56.376 --> 1:07:59.079
"Just--get--
listen, give me that,

1:07:59.112 --> 1:08:01.014
"put the knives away,
this is a celebration.

1:08:01.014 --> 1:08:02.282
You caught the right guy,
okay?"

1:08:02.315 --> 1:08:03.883
- [laughs]

1:08:03.917 --> 1:08:05.885
[cheers and applause]

1:08:05.919 --> 1:08:07.153
- The toughest person
in my family is

1:08:07.187 --> 1:08:08.254
by far my mom.

1:08:08.288 --> 1:08:10.023
She's tough. She's old-school.

1:08:10.056 --> 1:08:11.424
Like, if you ever got
in trouble with her,

1:08:11.458 --> 1:08:13.626
she would turn
whatever situation with you

1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:15.862
into a horror movie scene,
I promise you.

1:08:15.895 --> 1:08:17.330
[chuckles]
This one day she says,

1:08:17.364 --> 1:08:18.531
"Jordan, didn't I tell you

1:08:18.565 --> 1:08:20.033
"to come downstairs
and do these dishes?

1:08:20.033 --> 1:08:22.102
You better do these dishes
before you get in trouble."

1:08:22.135 --> 1:08:23.269
I lost at a video game.

1:08:23.303 --> 1:08:24.738
I got angry. I snapped.

1:08:24.771 --> 1:08:26.139
I said, "You ain't done
nothing all day.

1:08:26.172 --> 1:08:28.074
"I suggest you stay downstairs
and do them dishes

1:08:28.108 --> 1:08:29.642
before you get in trouble."

1:08:29.676 --> 1:08:32.379
[chuckles] Out of nowhere,
this is all I heard.

1:08:32.412 --> 1:08:34.414
[demonic voice] "Who the hell
you think you're talking to?"

1:08:34.447 --> 1:08:37.450
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

1:08:37.484 --> 1:08:39.052
As soon as I heard that voice,

1:08:39.052 --> 1:08:41.855
all the power in my house
cut off, okay?

1:08:41.888 --> 1:08:42.922
The lights cut off.

1:08:42.956 --> 1:08:44.924
These crows came
out of my closet.

1:08:44.958 --> 1:08:46.059
My windows opened up.

1:08:46.059 --> 1:08:47.227
There were
these two little girls

1:08:47.260 --> 1:08:48.895
in a school uniform
jumping rope and singing.

1:08:48.928 --> 1:08:53.400
They were like, "One, two,
you're mama's coming for you."

1:08:53.433 --> 1:08:54.734
- [laughs]

1:08:54.768 --> 1:08:56.903

confused.

I was, like following.

you've mentioned Kevin Hart.

that makes these people stars

1:10:03.803 --> 1:10:05.372
is there are people
that come out

1:10:05.405 --> 1:10:06.940

and this is not an act.

The difference is people go,
"I love Kevin Hart."

"I love Jordan Conley.
