{\an1}- Like I'm so over it.
- It's the way it's said.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.348
{\an7}(Jenni)
'Oddly enough,
in between the fighting'

28:03.431 --> 28:05.683
{\an7}me and Sam were able to develop
a better friendship

28:05.767 --> 28:08.019
{\an7}that I never thought
I would have with her.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.271
{\an1}Our last Sunday dinner
in Italy.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.774
{\an1}It smells phenomenal!
Can I have the tortellini?

28:12.857 --> 28:16.528
{\an1}- Enjoy, guys.
- I hope you like it.

28:16.611 --> 28:17.821
Can you pass me the hairspray?

28:17.904 --> 28:20.865
{\an1}Don't [bleep] put it
in your mouth, please.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.325
{\an1}- That's what I told him.
- It tastes good.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.493
{\an1}I-I've never cooked before.
Like, come on.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.412
{\an1}- No, it's good. I tasted it.
- It's good?

28:25.495 --> 28:27.455
{\an1}- Yeah, it's actually good.
- Thank you.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.291
{\an1}Okay, last Sunday dinner.
Let's do a toast.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.960
{\an1}I had a good time out here.
Like, I love Italy.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.963
{\an1}I had some of the best days
of my life out here.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.132
{\an1}- Yeah.
- I think that, being here...

28:37.215 --> 28:38.550
{\an1}We can really appreciate
what we're gonna have

28:38.633 --> 28:40.677
back in Jersey, you know?

28:40.760 --> 28:40.927
- So...
- 'Yeah, buddy.'

28:42.554 --> 28:43.847
I'm glad we're leaving.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.723
[laughing]

28:46.099 --> 28:48.393
Me too.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.228
{\an1}I love it out here,
but it's good to visit.

28:50.311 --> 28:51.229
- Yeah.
- I'm ready to go.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.021
'I want to go tanning.'

28:52.105 --> 28:53.648
Like, imagine walking into Karma

28:53.731 --> 28:55.817
and it'll be like, "Whoo!"

28:55.900 --> 28:57.068
{\an8}You know,
being here in Italy

28:57.152 --> 28:59.028
{\an8}obviously it's beautiful

28:59.112 --> 29:00.822
{\an8}<i>but I just miss the shore</i>

29:00.905 --> 29:01.948
<i>and we're going back.</i>

29:02.031 --> 29:03.116
I loved Italy.

29:03.199 --> 29:04.242
It was a great experience here.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.578
I didn't have any issues
with the house for once

29:06.661 --> 29:08.329
{\an1}and I felt pretty
[bleep] good about that.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.999
{\an1}For once, Ron and Sam
haven't been in a fight.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.208
{\an1}I know, I know.
That's why I'm knocking on wood.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.419
{\an1}Let's give a round of applause
for Ron and Sam.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.504
[all applauding]

29:16.588 --> 29:17.755
I love everybody.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.716
Thank you all for, like,
I don't know

29:19.799 --> 29:20.633
being cool and friends,
and I hope in Jersey

29:20.717 --> 29:22.760
we can all remain this way.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.805
{\an1}- Yes.
- Let's have fun in Jersey.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.640
<i>Salud.</i>
Yeah, buddy.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.517
Yeah, buddy, we're going
to Jersey. Yeah, buddy.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.686
{\an1}- Whoo! Tastes like cough syrup.
- 'No, it doesn't.'

29:31.769 --> 29:34.647
{\an1}I will drink
the whole frickin' bottle.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.609
I like you guys,
but I don't care

29:37.692 --> 29:38.776
what you guys say.

29:38.860 --> 29:42.655
{\an1}I'm going into my room
back in Jersey

29:42.739 --> 29:44.032
and I'm putting my bag there

29:44.115 --> 29:45.867
and that's my room,
and that's it.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.494
{\an1}Why-why-who are you to say
that that's your room?

29:47.577 --> 29:49.037
{\an1}How is that not my room?
Tell me.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.665
For me, I don't think upstairs
is a good place for me anymore.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.084
{\an1}And to go downstairs
would be easier on me, like...

29:55.168 --> 29:57.045
{\an1}Switch with somebody else.
That's my room.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.129
I want to keep my room.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.631
{\an8}I am thinking, like,
let's come up

29:59.714 --> 30:01.716
{\an7}with some kind of
compromisation on this room.

30:01.799 --> 30:04.344
{\an1}And Vin is just being
a complete little bitch.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.596
{\an1}Why can't you, Pauly and Mike
get a room together?

30:06.679 --> 30:09.807
{\an1}Mike brings drama
into different situations

30:09.891 --> 30:10.892
and we're not like that.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.061
We're drama-free.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.021
{\an1}- Hey, yeah, yeah, well...
- I mean, whatever.

30:15.104 --> 30:17.690
{\an1}If you want to sleep
on the couch downstairs...

30:17.774 --> 30:20.401
I don't care, so put me wherever
you want me to go. I don't care.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.945
{\an1}(Mike)
'Vinny's just a young kid'

30:22.028 --> 30:25.406
{\an7}so when a little drama
gets to Vinny, he shuts down.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.742
{\an1}When drama gets to me,
I get up.

30:27.825 --> 30:29.410
This is the only two-bedroom.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.622
{\an1}And we have a-a great thing,
you know what I'm saying?

30:32.705 --> 30:35.333
{\an1}- And we sleep in that room...
- Sometimes together.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.293
{\an1}- Sometimes together.
- Whatever, Vin.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.711
Like, do what you gotta do.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.088
{\an1}- Just it's [bleep] bull[bleep].
- I'm just...

30:40.171 --> 30:42.715
{\an1}Fight me for it.
Like, you know what I mean?

30:42.799 --> 30:45.760
{\an1}That's like the [bleep]
immature [bleep] bull[bleep].

30:45.843 --> 30:47.262
{\an1}- You alright?
- No. You know what I mean?

30:47.345 --> 30:48.429
You don't [bleep]
say anything.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.889
What do you want me
to say to him?

30:49.973 --> 30:51.266
{\an1}I'm the only one screaming
at the [bleep] kid.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.351
{\an1}What, do you want to fight
the kid over a [bleep] room?

30:53.434 --> 30:55.103
{\an1}I can't live with that [bleep]
douchebag in that room.

30:55.186 --> 30:59.274
{\an1}It's, like, bad luck.
You're gonna get mad at me.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.109
Just leave me alone.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.778
I'm not [bleep] rooming
with Mike.

31:03.861 --> 31:05.113
Nobody wants to room
with Mike.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.489
{\an1}We should just
[bleep] put Mike somewhere.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.783
Like, in a garbage can.

31:08.866 --> 31:10.118
Why don't we just say that?

31:10.201 --> 31:12.287
'Cause you can't do that.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.121
{\an1}Mike should just
take the freakin' couch.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.790
- Ooh, secrets.
- Disgusting.

31:15.873 --> 31:19.127
{\an1}We're just saying that
I could never live with Mike.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.295
[laughing]

31:20.378 --> 31:22.046
{\an1}Why are you laughing?
Like, I'm being serious.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.048
{\an1}You guys are not really gonna
have to worry about it

31:24.132 --> 31:27.635
{\an1}'cause I probably
am not going to Jersey.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.263
If you want to leave, bye.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.683
{\an8}You don't want to [bleep]
with me, bro.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.184
{\an8}You don't want to do it.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.561
{\an7}Lately, Mike's been doing
nothing but starting problems.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.480
{\an8}I'll eat you, mother [bleep].

31:39.564 --> 31:43.109
{\an7}If Mike gets into a fight,
I'm not gonna jump in.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.110
{\an8}- Let's go.
- Oh, my god.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.155
[rock music]

31:47.238 --> 31:49.490
I probably am not
going to Jersey.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.327
If you want to leave, bye.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.621
{\an1}I'm tired of fighting.
I'm tired of it.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.582
{\an8}Dude, are you kidding me?

31:57.665 --> 31:59.709
I don't consider you a friend.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.794
{\an1}Dude, everybody in the house
agrees with us

32:01.878 --> 32:03.046
even if they don't say it.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.339
What'd you say to Snooks?

32:04.422 --> 32:05.715
{\an1}I thought you were different
and you're not.

32:05.798 --> 32:06.841
- I am different.
- No, you're not.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.009
{\an1}- 'You're a [bleep].'
- No, I'm not a [bleep].

32:10.345 --> 32:13.056
I just, I just don't know how to
take the high road like you do.

32:13.139 --> 32:15.933
{\an1}You always take
the [bleep] express lane.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.935
{\an1}Yeah, but I'm not perfect.
I got my issues too, you know?

32:18.019 --> 32:20.521
{\an1}You just deal with it
a lot better than I do.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.690
No flash.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.320
[instrumental music]

32:29.989 --> 32:32.867
I don't really have issues
with you.

32:32.950 --> 32:35.912
{\an1}I'm not gonna have
an issue now we're [bleep].

32:35.995 --> 32:37.872
{\an1}If I have to live with Mike,
I'll tell you right now

32:37.955 --> 32:39.165
I'm not gonna be in that room.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.752
{\an1}I think that's, like,
why, you know, [bleep].

32:42.835 --> 32:44.879
{\an1}When I separate myself
from here

32:44.962 --> 32:46.881
{\an1}this is the best
I've ever [bleep] been.

32:46.964 --> 32:48.383
{\an1}That's the reason we don't get
along is this house

32:48.466 --> 32:49.717
is because of him.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.095
{\an1}I don't argue with everybody
in this house.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.763
- It's like...
- Not now.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.682
{\an1}It is what it is,
and that's what it's gonna be.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.684
{\an1}- Okay.
- I'm gonna go outside too.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.437
{\an7}I have no problem, you know,
standing by myself.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.855
{\an8}Not too many can.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.399

I just think that, like,
that [bleep] with Mike

33:34.095 --> 33:36.931
{\an1}and having it, like, remind me
of last year's bull [bleep]

33:37.014 --> 33:38.182
is freaking me out.

Alright, here it comes.

he's about to do something.

has to tell him

{\an1}like, "Yo, you can't do
this anymore."

34:06.294 --> 34:09.589
{\an1}It's like a...it's just
like a lost cause.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.716
{\an1}It's either leave or change,
you know?

34:11.799 --> 34:13.967
But he's not going to so...

34:14.051 --> 34:15.136
He can't, he can't.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.721

him, you know what I mean?

34:17.679 --> 34:19.766
He gets the point.

34:19.849 --> 34:20.850
{\an1}The only reason
he's acting like this

34:20.933 --> 34:23.268
{\an1}is out of whatever it is
that makes him happy.

it's VP.
