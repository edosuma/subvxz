00:04.050 --> 00:05.813
What I miss most is his smile.

00:07.987 --> 00:10.252
The truth is that it is my fault that everything ended well
.

00:13.060 --> 00:14.151
Why?

00:19.098 --> 00:22.830
Most people do not know that there are things
monsters.

00:24.237 --> 00:25.261
I dread.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.137
The evil is out there, and I'll find
,

00:28.342 --> 00:31.023
and I'll put it in the place that corresponds
, but do it alone.

00:33.612 --> 00:35.045
The Devil's pay.

00:37.016 --> 00:38.210
Know what I'm doing.

00:39.986 --> 00:41.010
I believe.

01:08.949 --> 01:12.908
These terrorists really believe that away with it.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.954
All know that in reality there is no evil.

01:16.190 --> 01:21.025
<i>Allah Akbar </i>.

01:21.396 --> 01:23.660
- Allah Akbar.
- Here it is! Come!

01:23.931 --> 01:25.057
Here it is!

01:29.636 --> 01:34.733
I just received a vision
sent by Allah, bless his mercy.

01:35.642 --> 01:37.702
No more warnings.

01:37.979 --> 01:41.710
Dogs and pigs
just ignore them,

01:41.816 --> 01:46.775
and are not worthy to survive
to divine wrath of Allah.

01:48.556 --> 01:52.652
Therefore, prepare
to enter paradise.

01:54.095 --> 01:56.655
- Allah Akbar.
- Praise be to Allah.

01:56.864 --> 02:00.961
<i>- Allah Akbar.
- Allah Akbar</i>

02:01.670 --> 02:03.694
Tell my mother not to cry,

02:04.105 --> 02:05.800
for I will go to paradise..

02:06.340 --> 02:08.604
May your grief become anger,

02:08.943 --> 02:12.846
Because I give my life
on by Jihad for Allah.

02:47.883 --> 02:51.011
- Use it only once. Do not forget.
- Do not worry about me, friend.

02:52.254 --> 02:54.018
If you have a concern,

02:54.624 --> 02:56.922
if ever you betray our trust,

02:57.359 --> 02:59.239
I have to tell you what you'll
, right?

02:59.628 --> 03:01.653
Hey, I spent far
all your trials.

03:01.997 --> 03:03.157
I am the good, brother.

03:03.699 --> 03:06.032
Spend
this test and get everything you want.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.186
I have a face only.

03:35.764 --> 03:37.095
Is the best we could do.

03:39.669 --> 03:43.070
Is just the tip of the iceberg.
You're working with someone else,

03:45.275 --> 03:47.539
Someone of great concern.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.580
Your mission is to find and eliminate
,

03:51.949 --> 03:53.468
with whoever you're with him.

03:53.883 --> 03:56.044
And as always, do not let
evidence or witnesses.

03:56.553 --> 03:58.783
Find out what you can and kill all.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.023
If you fail at something, deny our participation
,

04:02.593 --> 04:03.753
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.124
Want you to know you're the only...

04:05.262 --> 04:07.196
we trust you will do this job well.

04:07.798 --> 04:08.798
Only you.

04:22.713 --> 04:23.771
Where is?

04:46.638 --> 04:48.229
The Great Satan!

05:53.105 --> 05:54.629
Your mother would be proud.

05:55.141 --> 05:56.942
A steel balls.
Thanks for the message.

05:57.243 --> 05:58.642
This time I catch you.

05:59.078 --> 06:00.439
How is the environment
up there?

06:01.146 --> 06:03.171
- Do not want to go, buddy.
- Why? What do you expect me?

06:12.024 --> 06:13.024
Bite me!

06:13.759 --> 06:16.091
- In your dreams, garbage.
- Be what you are.

06:16.696 --> 06:18.822
Your powers of genius belong to us.

06:20.065 --> 06:23.229
Your breath is already warped.
You make me nauseous.

06:24.537 --> 06:25.697
Now shut up!

06:32.646 --> 06:33.646
Wash!

06:45.625 --> 06:46.819
Here's the problem.

06:53.567 --> 06:54.863
Now is a little better.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Now...

06:56.116 --> 06:57.789
<i>You give me information </i> ?

06:58.070 --> 06:59.833
You must bite!

07:00.072 --> 07:02.836
For the glory of Allah, bite me!

07:03.242 --> 07:05.837
Okay, get ready.
Are you ready?

07:15.788 --> 07:17.017
A bloodbath.

07:17.224 --> 07:18.589
Good.

07:47.288 --> 07:48.653
You again.

07:49.222 --> 07:51.713
Seems that this time
grabbed me with his hands in the dough.

07:51.925 --> 07:52.925
Do not move.

07:54.194 --> 07:55.194
Do not move!

07:55.362 --> 07:57.762
Will you let me?
These guys bleed much.

07:58.064 --> 07:59.064
I'm serious.

08:01.169 --> 08:02.659
This is the last time.

08:03.137 --> 08:04.161
Okay.

08:08.275 --> 08:09.936
- What is this?
- Silver.

08:10.911 --> 08:13.938
Not for werewolves?

08:15.082 --> 08:16.208
Arde.

08:16.717 --> 08:17.843
I never shot with a silver bullet.

08:18.119 --> 08:19.399
I have a magazine full of them.

08:19.587 --> 08:22.751
Yes? If you ever shoot me, will you do me angry
.

08:27.161 --> 08:28.161
Enough.

08:50.618 --> 08:53.052
Let me guess.
Holy Water?

08:53.688 --> 08:56.749
Please.
Affect me more water sewer.

09:08.036 --> 09:10.231
Come on, get up.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.267
Is this
everything you got for me?

09:14.276 --> 09:15.276
Pathetic.

09:20.782 --> 09:22.147
It seems you were studying...

09:22.651 --> 09:23.982
but the wrong books.

09:25.287 --> 09:26.287
Mira.

09:26.955 --> 09:28.048
Improvisa.

09:28.758 --> 09:30.817
Grab knives and arrÃ³jamelos.

09:41.637 --> 09:42.637
Good shot.

09:50.914 --> 09:52.643
Not the face.

10:00.122 --> 10:01.283
My turn.

10:18.207 --> 10:19.927
You know what happens when
kill a cop?

10:20.743 --> 10:22.370
I have to kill a couple more?

11:25.877 --> 11:27.572
I am so eager to kill you.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.743
Going to say the same.

11:31.248 --> 11:32.510
What's stopping you?

11:34.284 --> 11:37.048
- I'm not the one who is immortal.
- I'm recovering.

11:37.888 --> 11:38.888
Awaits only.

11:38.889 --> 11:41.484
Yes? I'm just resting
so come anytime.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.428
You're lucky Only.

11:45.764 --> 11:48.425
- Although you're persistent.
- I'll get you whatever happens.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.631
All time're killing people. It's...

11:51.847 --> 11:52.847
is twisted.

11:52.871 --> 11:56.136
'm A murderer. What do you want?
How to get a job?

11:57.409 --> 11:59.673
Addition, these guys are trash.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.105
Only clean the place before you arrive.

12:03.382 --> 12:05.440
- They do a favor.
- Toma.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.445
Make me another and clavate this stake through the heart

12:11.823 --> 12:15.282
Sorry.
Have to keep trying.

12:16.162 --> 12:18.926
Tell me. Except I want to kill me,

12:19.932 --> 12:23.128
- why are so right?
- Presumption of innocence.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.662
I must arrest these guys,
not let mates.

12:25.904 --> 12:27.030
What about me?

12:27.906 --> 12:29.931
- You never saw me kill anyone.
- You're guilty.

12:31.309 --> 12:34.973
Look, look what you are.
're Not even human.

12:35.548 --> 12:36.879
Deserve to burn in hell.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.247
Possibly true.

12:40.985 --> 12:43.715
But if you knew what these dirty
thought cockroaches do...

12:43.955 --> 12:46.550
- The system will deal with them.
- The system is a joke.

12:47.326 --> 12:49.317
Were guilty.
Believe me.

12:49.895 --> 12:52.728
My solution was much faster and cheaper than
yours.

12:53.966 --> 12:55.331
And still justice.

12:55.401 --> 12:57.529
What gives you the right to be judge and jury
?

12:58.004 --> 12:59.527
Can not know everything.

13:00.039 --> 13:01.370
'll Tell you what I know.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.874
There are terrorists invading the city.

- I'm evil, but there are worse.
- The arrest you.

13:09.816 --> 13:10.908
You will not.

13:15.455 --> 13:16.547
I must go.

13:17.356 --> 13:20.086
By the way, you have ten
seconds to cut and run.

13:20.726 --> 13:21.988
The building will explode.

13:22.495 --> 13:23.962
Do not you had said?

13:52.994 --> 13:55.393
What can you tell us about
what happened here?

13:57.330 --> 14:02.496
You see... this building here...
exploded.

14:03.337 --> 14:04.429
Is on fire.

14:06.007 --> 14:07.527
And possibly the temperature is high.

14:12.746 --> 14:15.579
Did you hear the thunder last night?
It was crazy.

14:15.916 --> 14:19.818
Well, friend.
Not again slept?

14:20.453 --> 14:21.613
Ticked my work.

14:22.088 --> 14:26.150
Does your job?
What the hell is this?

14:27.395 --> 14:29.693
As I said... my job.

14:29.931 --> 14:32.228
I have the FBI, the CIA, the NSA,

14:32.632 --> 14:36.000
National Security and above your fault.

14:36.337 --> 14:37.337
Do you know...

14:38.439 --> 14:41.340
- Coffee I like women.
- Do not say it.

14:41.776 --> 14:43.334
Come to my office now!

14:45.747 --> 14:46.839
Bitter and dark.

14:51.352 --> 14:52.910
Want explanations.

14:55.389 --> 14:57.255
Tell me what you omitted in the report.

14:57.993 --> 14:59.324
All I know is there.

14:59.895 --> 15:01.863
- I swear.
- Really?

15:02.197 --> 15:04.597
A single suspect.
No forced entry.

15:04.867 --> 15:07.892
More than 100 shots were fired, but
a drop of his blood was not found.

15:08.603 --> 15:11.197
Ni there is minimal evidence
have been there.

15:11.672 --> 15:13.606
Doubt this man even exist.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.241
Not know what can I say.

15:15.509 --> 15:16.771
's In the report.

15:20.249 --> 15:23.446
Mr. President, we caught one.
We gave incomplete information...

15:23.685 --> 15:26.619
on a meeting between major terrorist
in Manyak Akbar.

15:26.787 --> 15:29.484
Apparently is also a Soviet expert on weapons.

15:30.359 --> 15:31.485
Let me guess.

15:32.094 --> 15:35.086
We will not tell you the date of this meeting
...

15:35.530 --> 15:38.124
until you get to New York
with your attorney.

15:38.467 --> 15:41.109
Request permission to proceed with enhanced interrogation, sir.

15:41.137 --> 15:42.331
Forward, heck!

I'll show you the place.

16:12.735 --> 16:14.100
You'll love.

16:20.108 --> 16:21.769
What does the fetus?

16:23.813 --> 16:26.782
Is Marud.
Is our expert in explosives.

16:28.451 --> 16:30.214
- But...
- No one better.

16:32.088 --> 16:36.423
Please
our servants will take you to your room.

16:46.036 --> 16:47.901
'll Call for the meeting.

17:34.718 --> 17:36.413
Master!

17:38.088 --> 17:41.252
Master, have returned!
They have returned!

17:42.093 --> 17:43.355
They have returned!

17:43.962 --> 17:46.055
Brother, have returned!

17:49.768 --> 17:51.029
Where are the others?

17:52.636 --> 17:56.572
- I'm the only one left.
- Yes, you've done well.

17:57.674 --> 18:01.735
I have completed my search.

18:02.447 --> 18:04.813
Definitely.
TrÃ¡iganle drink.

18:12.890 --> 18:13.891
Please.

18:26.739 --> 18:31.334
Take this box to my room
and prepare a toast!

18:35.681 --> 18:40.778
Celebrating our unit
drink for Jihad.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.819
Life is in the blood.

18:48.927 --> 18:52.886
This... is our Jihad bomb.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.728
Will exploit an entire city.

19:00.539 --> 19:04.201
Just need to insert nuclear material here,

19:04.476 --> 19:07.377
and a detonator anger there.

19:08.114 --> 19:12.483
A common nuclear bomb would destroy this area.

19:13.018 --> 19:16.419
Y blast...
come here.

19:17.523 --> 19:22.324
But the experimental material that will bring
cause a big harm...

19:22.661 --> 19:24.301
we can only assume its magnitude.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.760
Nobody has seen its effects.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.896
But should do this.

19:33.073 --> 19:34.973
What would we do without the Russians?

19:38.011 --> 19:39.205
Apologize.

19:40.279 --> 19:45.012
But where will that get
nuclear material?

19:45.551 --> 19:47.018
I'll.

19:47.820 --> 19:53.817
Concerned by entering enemy territory undetected.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.896
I have studied all possible ways to enter the US

19:58.231 --> 20:02.064
Found more easily and safely as possible,

20:02.301 --> 20:05.032
without the slightest chance of being caught
.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.706
Got student visas for all.

20:08.975 --> 20:12.274
Something called racial profiling and political correctness
,

20:12.679 --> 20:16.843
which basically means that no
chances are requisitioned us

20:17.083 --> 20:20.917
Exactly as we see them as terrorists.

20:34.602 --> 20:35.966
I'll.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.834
All out.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.075
But...

20:43.543 --> 20:45.033
Get out!

21:23.285 --> 21:24.285
Yes, sir.

21:24.519 --> 21:28.387
Find them where they hide is
.

21:28.724 --> 21:32.750
And... I want to be extensive.

21:37.765 --> 21:38.891
Absolutely.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.264
Any particular method?

21:41.803 --> 21:45.762
- Something... style.
- OK.

21:56.718 --> 21:58.185
Do your worst,

21:58.487 --> 22:01.684
unrestricted.
Do not want to hear.

22:02.257 --> 22:03.520
No problem.
I will do it.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.327
Yes Thank you Mr. Chairman..

22:09.264 --> 22:10.663
Security did not stop.

22:11.233 --> 22:14.328
Our
facial recognition system detected it a few hours ago.

22:17.540 --> 22:20.338
His name is.
Fatah Muhammad Bin Akeem...

22:20.476 --> 22:22.444
Kalahmi Ahkbah Salim Fatan...

22:22.779 --> 22:25.440
Fahid Hasan Yasin Abdulla Kwanii.

22:27.115 --> 22:29.481
To hell.
Will tell Bob.

22:31.653 --> 22:33.712
Not know exactly to plan.

22:34.056 --> 22:36.116
Always seems to be a few steps ahead.

22:36.526 --> 22:38.619
But has eliminated
best agents in the world.

22:38.795 --> 22:39.795
What suspicions?

22:39.896 --> 22:42.364
I can not even imagine.
But whatever it is,

22:43.065 --> 22:44.362
be catastrophic.

22:44.833 --> 22:46.562
Why we need to stop him.

22:48.604 --> 22:50.629
This is one of his last
atrocities.

22:51.607 --> 22:54.940
His men were mixed with children
carrying explosives.

22:56.446 --> 22:59.211
This guy is totally evil.
Is an outcast.

22:59.683 --> 23:01.479
- Must die.
- Any clues?

23:02.685 --> 23:04.482
Yeah, just a narcotics officer.

23:05.121 --> 23:08.454
Looked for sellers and found a terrorist group.

23:08.926 --> 23:10.951
Now directly responds to the NSA.

23:11.295 --> 23:12.557
Is too much for him.

23:14.198 --> 23:16.666
- Does that police are still following you?
- Not for much longer.

23:17.167 --> 23:20.727
- Want us to handle?
- No, I can handle it.

23:21.037 --> 23:23.505
Keep saying that.
Why do not you remove it?

23:23.973 --> 23:25.294
Have the authority to do so.

23:26.776 --> 23:29.506
Look at that.
It's worse than we thought.

23:30.881 --> 23:33.145
They call Verdugo.

23:33.484 --> 23:35.145
Loves decapitation.

23:35.419 --> 23:39.218
Possibly hooded several videos of beheadings man.

23:41.124 --> 23:44.060
It's explosives expert
dangerous world and perhaps the best.

23:44.294 --> 23:45.294
His name is Marud.

23:45.729 --> 23:47.424
What size do not be fooled.

23:48.098 --> 23:50.623
AlÂ¡ loves
dealing with chemical weapons!

23:51.201 --> 23:53.261
Create new drugs for the enemy.

23:53.638 --> 23:55.299
Is a way to finance the Jihad.

23:56.507 --> 23:58.441
According to our informant,
are gone...

23:58.675 --> 23:59.972
to an unknown location.

24:00.344 --> 24:01.902
We can not stand still.

24:02.045 --> 24:03.775
You must go to that deposit.

24:03.982 --> 24:06.348
Kill
these cockroaches and see what happens.

24:07.652 --> 24:11.053
And if you start looking at Bob...

24:13.158 --> 24:15.182
The errand boy.
Have stupid face.

24:15.559 --> 24:17.959
Press it.
Something will escape.

24:19.096 --> 24:20.324
Sounds like fun.

24:21.532 --> 24:23.363
Do not underestimate these guys.

24:24.134 --> 24:25.158
Train hard.

24:25.837 --> 24:28.271
Are you ready for everything.
Possibly up to you.

24:29.507 --> 24:31.338
Maybe you have
agree a plan this time.

24:33.811 --> 24:35.403
You know what my plan?

24:36.013 --> 24:38.054
Back to the desert
All in body bags,

24:38.283 --> 24:41.480
where Allah will not recognize
or by their dental records.

24:44.456 --> 24:45.480
Yes

24:59.400 --> 25:00.497
<i>What is this</i>

25:00.948 --> 25:02.117
<i>Bags for corpses</i>

25:06.278 --> 25:10.611
Did you go into them,
or I'll have to put them?

25:42.215 --> 25:43.910
I thought we talked about this.

25:46.252 --> 25:47.549
Right. Toma.

25:50.055 --> 25:51.856
Half
the house is still mine, right?

25:53.827 --> 25:55.192
'll Have your half.

25:57.497 --> 25:59.137
Come on, do you really want to sell the house
?

25:59.566 --> 26:00.658
Do we want to?

26:01.368 --> 26:02.460
Look!

26:02.869 --> 26:04.165
Look at your face!

26:05.104 --> 26:06.401
Again vampires?

26:11.277 --> 26:13.973
I can not see well.

26:15.248 --> 26:18.547
- Not just for me.
- I chase the bad, dear.

26:22.454 --> 26:24.295
Look, I'm trying to do something useful
.

26:25.524 --> 26:27.083
Can not we try again?

26:27.961 --> 26:29.326
I mean we love.

26:36.570 --> 26:38.869
You can quit your day job.

26:40.106 --> 26:42.165
- Do not ask me that.
- You can start again.

26:42.576 --> 26:44.168
We can start over.

26:47.882 --> 26:48.882
I...

26:57.491 --> 26:58.514
Sorry.

27:00.226 --> 27:01.523
I must go.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.965
I told them they get
in the bags!

27:43.171 --> 27:45.002
- Help!
- What's up?

27:45.173 --> 27:47.733
The great Satan, who has powers
genius.

27:48.310 --> 27:49.310
Yes?

27:50.178 --> 27:51.440
Is he here?

27:58.619 --> 27:59.881
Adjou!

28:09.765 --> 28:11.254
Where is your boss?

28:12.299 --> 28:14.859
- I can not tell you.
- I start marcarte.

28:19.041 --> 28:22.875
Pain is temporary
compared with what will happen to me if I speak.

28:24.479 --> 28:27.916
We have prepared to ask...

28:28.418 --> 28:30.942
you to bite us if you were,

28:31.386 --> 28:33.547
so... bite me.

28:34.089 --> 28:36.421
Why do I always think I'll turn
?

28:36.992 --> 28:39.018
You want to blow themselves again and again?

28:40.830 --> 28:41.830
Please?

28:58.447 --> 29:00.746
- I can not believe you did that.
- Yup?

29:02.452 --> 29:03.452
It hurt?

29:03.820 --> 29:04.820
No.

29:06.188 --> 29:07.280
You Punch skin.

29:12.261 --> 29:13.523
What is your problem?

29:16.432 --> 29:17.632
What I have to shoot you?

29:17.800 --> 29:20.633
Now I have to stand the smell of garlic
as you kick your ass.

30:05.849 --> 30:06.975
Come on, get up.

30:12.456 --> 30:15.425
- Are we done?
- Yeah yeah.

30:17.595 --> 30:19.061
Ended.

30:32.610 --> 30:34.202
You know, when you finish
rest,

30:34.712 --> 30:36.702
'll throw you against the wall
, among other things.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.410
Maybe you lose that arm.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.013
I will not give up.

30:42.953 --> 30:45.945
- Yes, that thought.
- How can you look in the mirror?

30:48.393 --> 30:50.384
Want to know how it is, right?

30:52.463 --> 30:55.488
There are demons.
Thousands of demons.

30:56.466 --> 31:00.494
- I owned, and I became.
- Only a demon is pretty bad.

31:00.805 --> 31:02.033
Yes, you think so?

31:03.541 --> 31:05.475
Although I make the decisions.

31:06.544 --> 31:08.464
How much
willpower is needed for that?

31:10.516 --> 31:12.711
Know how many.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.580
- So if you changed so much...
- Look at it like this...

31:17.889 --> 31:19.379
all have a dark side.

31:20.725 --> 31:23.820
Portas a cross and see it as
sin. Others see it as evil.

31:24.196 --> 31:26.221
For me it is more literal, but...

31:26.732 --> 31:29.292
The key is how you recognize
and keep control.

31:29.969 --> 31:32.232
And if you're so good, why
you can not look a cross?

31:32.470 --> 31:34.768
A kind of biochemical reaction...

31:35.273 --> 31:38.731
Hell, I do not know.
Do not just talk of demons?

31:39.444 --> 31:40.706
They can not tolerate it.

31:41.112 --> 31:42.306
They are the problem, not me.

31:42.947 --> 31:44.438
Yes, but you get all your strength.

31:45.050 --> 31:48.986
Yes, and I will not waste it.

31:50.088 --> 31:52.886
If I can master them,
I can use this power in pursuit of the truth,

31:53.458 --> 31:55.825
justice and way of life
US.

31:56.528 --> 31:58.393
're A vampire possessed by demons.

31:58.831 --> 32:01.493
- It is my duty to eliminate you.
- I'll tell you something.

32:02.034 --> 32:05.129
If you stop sinning, I'll let
eliminate me. OK?

32:05.505 --> 32:06.505
MuÃ©rdeme.

32:08.207 --> 32:11.404
Is it a sin... or place an order?

32:14.546 --> 32:16.014
Do not bite me!

32:32.831 --> 32:34.298
Rip . Come over.

32:40.073 --> 32:41.073
Are you okay?

32:41.141 --> 32:43.473
Going to ruin my work.
You have to turn away.

32:43.910 --> 32:45.429
Okay, listen.
We can handle it.

32:45.544 --> 32:46.977
Look, I'm not in this.

32:47.780 --> 32:49.112
I'm something else.

32:51.384 --> 32:54.114
Obviously, you need help
with whatever it is.

32:54.955 --> 32:57.423
Hey, Rip.
You need to go to hospital.

32:57.691 --> 32:59.853
Just wanted you to know that I'm not following you
.

33:00.728 --> 33:02.093
Stay safe, okay?

33:32.092 --> 33:33.390
Everyone is dead.

33:33.661 --> 33:35.629
Who did it?
What did you see?

33:37.665 --> 33:39.495
I asked him to bite me.

33:41.868 --> 33:43.598
Something is coming.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.569
For all of us.

33:47.375 --> 33:51.106
No more mistakes!
Not be tolerated!

33:52.580 --> 33:56.517
Give  ten lashes.
That will cure your fear.

33:57.518 --> 34:03.650
- Thank you! Thank you, Master!
- Whatever it is, we'll be ready.

34:16.170 --> 34:18.570
Tonight you were very close.

34:21.675 --> 34:23.370
Do not tell me was another time that police
.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.786
're Too valuable to let a guy like
keep you busy.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.308
- Both know that can happen.
- Do not worry about me.

34:31.663 --> 34:32.663
Had to kill time.

34:32.687 --> 34:33.846
Why not think about killing
more than the time...?

34:34.221 --> 34:35.585
When you see him again?

34:36.891 --> 34:39.827
We raised some rumors and confirmed...

34:40.728 --> 34:42.458
ruined it completely.

34:43.532 --> 34:45.431
Zubri saw you.

34:49.572 --> 34:50.572
How serious is it?

34:51.741 --> 34:53.764
May be too severe.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.263
This time may
be prepared for you.

35:06.456 --> 35:09.016
Hey, I can talk to you a minute?

35:09.258 --> 35:10.349
About?

35:11.893 --> 35:14.885
I think I found evidence
makes no sense.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.763
Wanted to ask about it.

35:17.099 --> 35:18.123
What is it?

35:20.535 --> 35:21.593
Vampires.

35:23.072 --> 35:26.303
- What? Come on, fuck!
- No, no. I'm serious.

35:27.510 --> 35:32.208
I... I think.
I think I can help you prove it.

35:43.961 --> 35:47.760
- Okay.
- So... tell me about the vampire.

35:49.132 --> 35:52.260
- What do you know?
- Who is it? What it does

35:54.270 --> 35:55.602
Can you see what it does.

35:56.773 --> 35:58.138
Is a sadistic murderer.

35:58.976 --> 36:00.967
You read the reports, right?
It was always him.

36:01.345 --> 36:03.438
Is he alone?
Are you serious?

36:03.680 --> 36:05.613
- No. Intense, right?
- How do you do?

36:05.915 --> 36:08.884
- Dodge the bullets?
- No, do not.

36:09.318 --> 36:11.786
Not your style.
Receives and keeps smiling.

36:12.421 --> 36:13.718
What happens?

36:14.624 --> 36:16.148
Sana instantly.

36:17.561 --> 36:19.426
Yes, and another thing:

36:20.531 --> 36:22.362
is huge and strong.

36:22.699 --> 36:25.223
Can throw you farther than you expect
.

36:25.501 --> 36:28.596
Go! What else can you do?

36:31.542 --> 36:34.238
When enraged and
has sufficient strength,

36:35.279 --> 36:38.146
You can hear your heart beating strong
before killing.

36:38.382 --> 36:40.817
And the weirdest part is...

36:41.518 --> 36:44.078
can interfere with electronic equipment...

36:45.088 --> 36:48.455
frequency radio signals
television, and other things.

36:48.992 --> 36:54.761
- Is serious. Can you fly?
- Yes. I asked him once.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.292
I explained that fly all the time consuming
him much strength.

36:59.536 --> 37:02.334
Can you run your
maximum speed all the time?

37:03.473 --> 37:05.441
Yes, makes sense.

37:07.411 --> 37:09.572
What else? Garlic?

37:09.947 --> 37:12.348
No, just annoyed.

37:12.650 --> 37:13.810
Silver Bullets?

37:14.586 --> 37:17.679
- I used them. They did not work.
- Bite?

37:18.188 --> 37:19.985
No, of course not.
Will not bite anyone.

37:20.457 --> 37:23.916
It seems the last vampire.
And it will not become anyone else.

37:27.065 --> 37:28.999
And not turn to anyone else.

37:30.902 --> 37:32.893
You whole Van Helsing, Rip.

37:33.739 --> 37:35.832
- Son of...
- I came to suck your blood.

37:37.775 --> 37:38.775
Basta!

37:41.212 --> 37:42.941
Come to my office now!

37:43.414 --> 37:45.212
The rest back to work!

37:50.723 --> 37:52.213
Want to tell me was that all about?

37:55.159 --> 37:57.627
Okay, so tell me what this is.

37:59.030 --> 38:00.361
I told you, everything is there.

38:00.832 --> 38:03.801
Yes, but what you omitted
on monsters.

38:06.438 --> 38:08.406
Internal Affairs wants a psychological test.

38:09.975 --> 38:10.975
Great.

38:10.976 --> 38:13.773
His word is law. If you approve,
will have a 30-day suspension.

38:14.145 --> 38:15.145
But...

38:17.149 --> 38:18.741
Sorry, it's out of my hands.

38:20.052 --> 38:21.781
Nobody does the amount of
hours I do.

38:22.321 --> 38:24.186
I
dedication to my work, you know.

38:24.590 --> 38:25.784
Well, convince.

38:26.191 --> 38:28.319
Talk about vampires and see what they say
.

38:28.762 --> 38:30.786
Is this because...? Come on.

38:31.430 --> 38:33.796
Only joking.
We do it all the time.

38:36.035 --> 38:37.866
How long have not you rest?

38:41.841 --> 38:42.865
A while.

38:44.744 --> 38:47.508
Go home.
Get some sleep.

38:49.915 --> 38:52.145
RetrasarÃ© your assessment until tonight.

38:56.588 --> 38:57.680
If I had a house.

39:00.759 --> 39:02.990
Sorry, I will not disrespect
,

39:03.430 --> 39:06.558
but when we complete the tunnel,
how do we cross?

39:07.700 --> 39:10.225
We take a year and nobody could survive
inside.

39:10.469 --> 39:12.131
Do not worry, brother.

39:13.173 --> 39:15.334
Allah will provide.

39:15.675 --> 39:19.702
Soon opacaremos both the attack on Manhattan

39:19.979 --> 39:23.973
the world to forget completely.

39:33.393 --> 39:36.158
There is new information about some kind of genius.

39:37.098 --> 39:38.998
A species of goat-god.

39:39.834 --> 39:40.834
Yes, of course.

39:41.235 --> 39:43.100
Do not take it so lightly.

39:45.271 --> 39:46.465
Yes? Why not?

39:47.107 --> 39:50.008
- Me breakfast geniuses.
- Say it's a Marid,

39:51.077 --> 39:52.942
The most dangerous kind of genius.

39:53.613 --> 39:55.342
Is not a fairy tale.

39:56.884 --> 39:57.884
Really?

39:58.452 --> 40:00.113
You expect me to believe that?

40:01.055 --> 40:02.521
You exist, right?

40:20.441 --> 40:23.933
Look, I've been thinking.

40:25.112 --> 40:26.545
And maybe not have to resign.

40:27.748 --> 40:28.943
I think they'll fire me.

40:30.185 --> 40:31.743
Nor trust you?

40:32.621 --> 40:34.714
Yes, also believe
'm crazy.

40:35.590 --> 40:37.353
Well, you're wrong.

40:37.859 --> 40:40.419
Look, I just want to know if
happens, we'll have a chance.

40:44.231 --> 40:45.789
What can I say, Rip?

40:46.400 --> 40:47.400
Yes

40:48.235 --> 40:51.228
- Not if you're so broke.!
- What do you want me to do?

40:51.506 --> 40:53.466
What would you like to do?
What you show the vampire?

40:53.642 --> 40:55.439
Do you really think that is what I

41:03.385 --> 41:04.579
Sorry.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.814
I must go.

41:10.559 --> 41:11.719
Sorry.

41:15.030 --> 41:16.395
Cursed vampire.

41:17.566 --> 41:19.557
First my wife, then my job

41:46.796 --> 41:48.320
Who is that?

41:51.700 --> 41:54.498

Friday night.

42:02.945 --> 42:05.106
Excellent, excellent.

42:23.834 --> 42:25.954
The crawler our informant stopped working.

42:26.569 --> 42:27.569
Know why.

42:27.593 --> 42:28.721

42:29.038 --> 42:31.506
- Must be somewhere...

42:31.841 --> 42:32.841
Yes

42:33.342 --> 42:36.311
We receive all kinds of readings
seismic in this area.

42:37.747 --> 42:40.273
How safe do you feel in
the streets of his city

42:40.684 --> 42:43.084
knowing that the same officers
are to protect,

42:43.320 --> 42:45.515

42:45.756 --> 42:47.484

42:47.723 --> 42:49.588
pest
of government corruption.

42:49.792 --> 42:52.557
Public employees infecting our city and our nation.

42:52.996 --> 42:56.193
An officer intentionally does
exploit a crime scene.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.960
We also know that the same
official was involved...

42:59.236 --> 43:01.261
in the recent slaughter of deposit

43:01.538 --> 43:04.234
where 58 innocent people were killed
.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.120
I got it.

43:07.144 --> 43:09.271
Why can not
reveal his identity?

43:09.947 --> 43:13.714
By
government regulations that limit the freedom of this program.

43:15.086 --> 43:18.487
These images were taken
minutes after the incident.

43:18.990 --> 43:21.322
What kind of clandestine business
happened here?

43:22.626 --> 43:24.924
By this should worry.

43:27.397 --> 43:29.176
Allah Akbar.

43:37.408 --> 43:39.238
Allah Akbar.

43:45.483 --> 43:48.350

44:42.841 --> 44:45.241

44:47.913 --> 44:49.710
Come to the point.

44:50.549 --> 44:52.711
Do you believe in vampires?

44:52.919 --> 44:57.548
Yes. I mean, no.
Look, it's just a hobby.

44:57.823 --> 44:59.347
Hunt vampires?

44:59.458 --> 45:02.826
No, of course not.
Look, I only read about them.

45:03.029 --> 45:04.690
Just that.

45:13.352 --> 45:14.352
DISMISSED

45:18.410 --> 45:19.410
No.

45:19.745 --> 45:22.270
Allah Akbar.

45:23.082 --> 45:24.675
This is my favorite part.

45:25.552 --> 45:29.488
Allah Akbar.
Allah Akbar.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.285
Analyzing AUDIO.
DETERMINING LOCATION.

45:31.290 --> 45:32.290
Look.

45:34.193 --> 45:36.287
Already isolated background sound.

45:37.664 --> 45:38.824
Much excavation is heard.

45:39.299 --> 45:41.267
This confirms the seismic readings.

45:42.669 --> 45:45.194
Any time will determine your location.

45:55.915 --> 45:56.940
Sorry, Rip.

46:00.121 --> 46:01.121
Yes

46:12.899 --> 46:14.264
Will you be okay?

46:27.147 --> 46:29.708
At least I know who to call if
ever encounter a vampire.

46:32.987 --> 46:33.987
Thank you.

46:35.389 --> 46:36.720
I do not believe in vampires.

47:37.053 --> 47:39.052
Bob must eliminate as soon as possible.

47:39.754 --> 47:42.245
- Go to detonate a nuclear bomb.
- I will not let that happen.

47:43.758 --> 47:45.089
And remember,

47:45.594 --> 47:49.929
this genius is not like
enemies you fought in the past.

47:51.067 --> 47:53.433
Not sure I understand the dangers
.

47:53.803 --> 47:55.134
From what I read in the file,

47:55.304 --> 47:58.204
think I can remove it with a bit
weapons.

47:58.573 --> 48:00.302
'll Have all the weapons you want.

48:04.679 --> 48:08.514
Your main objective is
a command.

48:20.963 --> 48:22.988
You can do whatever you feel necessary
,

48:23.332 --> 48:27.769
to remove the dung ball
long name and blue eyes.

48:48.158 --> 48:49.158
's Him.

48:50.993 --> 48:52.358
Do my wife?

48:52.995 --> 48:55.088

49:40.912 --> 49:43.032
Just killed the guy

49:43.281 --> 49:47.080
I did you a big favor.
Going to take you into a trap.

50:06.503 --> 50:08.266
Now is your turn to do me a favor.

50:08.573 --> 50:11.542
Yes? And what do I get?
You help me regain my wife?

50:11.876 --> 50:15.903
'll Let you live.

50:20.386 --> 50:22.683
Still not sure which side are you on?

50:22.920 --> 50:24.717
Not yours.
Of this I am sure.

50:27.191 --> 50:29.159
Know that for me,
only need two things:

50:29.894 --> 50:31.385
a cross and a wooden stake.

50:32.097 --> 50:35.624
- But you brought much more.
- Makes me feel comfortable.

50:38.404 --> 50:39.871
Are you still comfortable?

51:19.878 --> 51:22.039
- What do you want from me?
- Rather than get in my way,

51:22.714 --> 51:24.875
why this might not help me?
Do we have a deal?

51:25.652 --> 51:28.120
No, these guys have my wife.
I want your help.

51:28.521 --> 51:31.081
- No, you help me.
- No, you help me.

51:34.793 --> 51:35.793
Do not move!

51:45.571 --> 51:47.853
I heard that you're taking the credit for my work
.

51:48.241 --> 51:50.835
- Did it help your career?
- Then talk about it.

51:51.511 --> 51:54.240
- You know I had nothing to do, right?
- Yes, of course.

52:02.655 --> 52:06.785
- I know you're obsessed.
- Stop talking crap.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.281
Should see the last
came for me in this way.

52:10.030 --> 52:11.860
Finished a psychiatric institute.

help me first.

52:21.275 --> 52:23.315
Seems that you're doing a pretty good job.

52:26.347 --> 52:27.371
I know.

52:34.454 --> 52:36.217
Do you still think we should
arrest these guys?

52:36.489 --> 52:38.719
Is in self defense.
Fully justified.

52:41.561 --> 52:42.756
Good job.

52:43.130 --> 52:44.130
Thank you.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.160

53:15.497 --> 53:16.794
That is one and a half.

53:17.566 --> 53:20.558

Going to do something great.

53:43.924 --> 53:45.255
We have to stop them.

53:45.993 --> 53:46.993
Ready?

53:48.697 --> 53:49.721
For what?

53:50.498 --> 53:53.023
- To kill Bob and his henchmen.
- Perhaps not understand me.

53:53.435 --> 53:55.699
- I will not help.
- Listen To Me.

53:56.004 --> 53:57.938
- Have a nuclear bomb.

I will not go there with you.

54:05.046 --> 54:06.604

- Rip

54:07.282 --> 54:09.843
if I go out and kill me, will be only

54:23.031 --> 54:24.692
Better do things my way.

54:24.933 --> 54:26.628
No, no.
My way.

54:28.336 --> 54:32.296
With pride and noise, friend.

56:05.236 --> 56:08.602
Still a virgin, right?

56:56.422 --> 56:57.422
I ran out of bullets.

57:00.926 --> 57:01.756
You've got a trick up his sleeve?

57:02.127 --> 57:03.126
Only one...

57:04.762 --> 57:06.059
Kicking ass.

57:32.958 --> 57:34.721
I ran out of bullets.

57:35.727 --> 57:37.319
The exact amount of bullets.

01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:12.914

- You have not said good once.
- I'm sorry, is rare.

Few more times and I'll say it smoothly.

01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:30.294
Maybe you have only one chance to say
.

01:08:03.032 --> 01:08:04.590
Come on, motherfucker!

01:08:06.735 --> 01:08:08.965

- Grab the bomb! Carefully!
- I do not know how.

01:08:35.233 --> 01:08:38.201
Slip back in the fucking skull!

In Spanish.

01:09:21.112 --> 01:09:22.203
What's wrong?

01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:29.443
By shedding the blood of a virgin, she lost her life in the skull.

01:09:29.787 --> 01:09:31.448
Do not you commented.

I did it to save others.
By Aisha.

01:10:09.427 --> 01:10:11.054
Do you see what this girl did for you?

01:10:11.329 --> 01:10:13.093
You hope you realize...

01:10:15.701 --> 01:10:16.725
Hey, are you okay?

01:10:17.769 --> 01:10:19.031
Is that you?

01:10:20.505 --> 01:10:22.735

I owe you one.

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:40.653

Do not look great, man.

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:03.972

Come on, get up.

01:12:16.557 --> 01:12:18.422
I want my life back.

01:12:19.426 --> 01:12:20.484
And my job.

01:12:22.396 --> 01:12:24.877
If everyone could see you're real
, give me back my job.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.666
You can not
want to return to that job, right?

01:12:29.104 --> 01:12:30.731
I like to go after the bad guys.

01:12:31.339 --> 01:12:33.272
So get up and go get them.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:41.543
Come on, what's all you got?

01:12:42.182 --> 01:12:43.182
Get up.

01:12:51.191 --> 01:12:53.659
- Use me as a shield.
- It will be fun.

01:15:11.802 --> 01:15:15.829
- Allah!
- Carrie!

01:15:25.148 --> 01:15:27.378
Rip!

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.146
Hey, buddy.
Can I ask you a favor?

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:00.747
Could you save my wife, please?

01:16:01.786 --> 01:16:03.220
Wish I could, friend,

01:16:04.756 --> 01:16:06.587
but this time you have to do it alone.

01:16:07.659 --> 01:16:11.220
As? Can not heal?

01:16:16.434 --> 01:16:17.696
Not this time.

01:16:27.212 --> 01:16:30.510
By God, I'll die.

01:16:32.683 --> 01:16:34.310
Hey, look on the bright side.

01:16:35.654 --> 01:16:37.747
You got rid of me.

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:40.625
This hurts.

01:16:41.793 --> 01:16:42.919
Tell me.

01:16:44.863 --> 01:16:46.057
Also hurts,

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.598
despite being a bloodsucker?

01:16:49.134 --> 01:16:50.134
Hey, Rip.

01:16:50.235 --> 01:16:51.395
Yes?

01:16:51.637 --> 01:16:53.157
I have a stake in the heart
.

01:16:58.478 --> 01:16:59.536
Hey...

01:17:01.581 --> 01:17:02.912
What is your name?

01:17:06.918 --> 01:17:10.979
Who will protect me?

01:17:11.623 --> 01:17:13.682
Maybe you want to come over
close friend.

01:17:13.825 --> 01:17:15.850
Can not you see we're dying?

01:17:16.461 --> 01:17:21.764
Nobody has protected because
angels are on my side.

01:17:21.934 --> 01:17:23.697
I know these angels.

01:17:24.469 --> 01:17:25.697
They encourage sulfur.

01:17:26.672 --> 01:17:28.299
Just got lucky.

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.936
There was no luck!

01:17:31.477 --> 01:17:37.438
The pious Allah takes care of me and guide me
Jihad.

01:17:37.784 --> 01:17:39.985
So why are you not a bit
kind to my wife?

01:17:41.755 --> 01:17:42.754
Let her go.

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:51.956
'll Tell you what I'll do with your dirty
wife.

01:17:53.701 --> 01:17:58.161
Le off his head slowly.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.201
If still alive, I'll give her head.

01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:08.105
Maybe even
record it so you can view.

01:18:10.817 --> 01:18:11.977
Hey, dog,

01:18:12.685 --> 01:18:14.711
tell you where you can get you that knife.

01:18:15.322 --> 01:18:16.721
I know where.

01:18:17.191 --> 01:18:20.717
Yes? Come and show me.

01:18:22.562 --> 01:18:25.327
Do not be silly.
's A trap.

01:18:27.901 --> 01:18:29.630
Come on, hen.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.870
- Do not go.
- I'll be here.

01:18:37.745 --> 01:18:39.269
Do not touch it!

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:41.272
Or what?

01:18:43.517 --> 01:18:44.745
What will you do?

01:18:48.656 --> 01:18:51.124
Listen carefully.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.760
I want you to cut the
head with a sword.

01:18:57.297 --> 01:19:00.858
Then I want you to take off your
fangs and bring me.

01:19:01.602 --> 01:19:05.868
And then put his head on a mirror and bury
box.

01:19:07.007 --> 01:19:08.406
Do you understand?

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.181
We have seen the last of your kind
.

01:19:17.384 --> 01:19:19.375
Enjoy your pain.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.402
Allah Akbar.

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.877
Allah Akbar.

01:19:41.509 --> 01:19:43.068
Please, no!

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.678
- No, please!
- Allah Akbar.

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:58.988
I would be dead not hear this.

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:03.731
Alto! No!
Do Not! Let me go!

01:20:25.589 --> 01:20:28.022
Bastard, you bit me!

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:31.322
- Just saved your life.
- No, you killed me!

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.207
Whatever.
You said you wanted to be dead.

01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:34.958
So it still being a genius?

01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:36.730
Also you were going to die.

01:20:37.267 --> 01:20:38.529
Now you'll still here.

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:41.802
So I can still save her?

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:45.470
Yes, but you'll be back with her.

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:49.604
- But my wife.
- I did not make the rules. Trust me.

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:54.379
In addition, surely said:
"till death do us part".

01:20:54.817 --> 01:20:58.515
- You're dead, breakaway.
- OK. Listen,

01:20:58.722 --> 01:21:00.642
We can summarize this for
you can get back there?

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.351
Quiet.
Time is not happening.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.192
We are in a spiritual reality.

01:21:05.928 --> 01:21:08.624
When you return, better hurry.

01:21:12.002 --> 01:21:14.061
Throughout the centuries,
passed the baton.

01:21:14.638 --> 01:21:17.004
When we get tired,
seek a replacement.

01:21:22.746 --> 01:21:24.714
Sorry.
I must go.

01:21:29.586 --> 01:21:30.848
Will you be okay?

01:21:34.558 --> 01:21:37.322
You used me, you deceived me.

01:21:37.595 --> 01:21:39.620
Would you have given
if you would have told you?

01:21:44.601 --> 01:21:45.761
I was training, Rip.

01:21:46.303 --> 01:21:49.022
Come on, get up.

01:21:50.286 --> 01:21:51.286
Come on, get up.

01:21:53.711 --> 01:21:54.711
Good job.

01:21:57.715 --> 01:21:58.806
'll Let you live.

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:00.806
- Do not bite me!
- I gave you a gift.

01:22:01.151 --> 01:22:02.151
A gift?

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:05.753
Have a commitment to justice
I never saw anyone.

01:22:06.691 --> 01:22:07.783
're Strong, determined,

01:22:08.326 --> 01:22:09.623
everything you need to be.

01:22:11.429 --> 01:22:13.624
Can I still be good?

01:22:14.231 --> 01:22:15.256
Count on that.

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:17.395
So get up and go get them.

01:22:21.539 --> 01:22:22.699
A good vampire.

01:22:27.045 --> 01:22:28.535
I think it might.

01:22:34.618 --> 01:22:39.715
You start now.
The barracks are in the basement of taxes.

01:22:41.192 --> 01:22:42.682
Death and taxes.

01:22:44.662 --> 01:22:45.924
Save the world, Rip.

01:22:46.797 --> 01:22:50.393
Save your wife.
The rules are simple.

01:22:50.969 --> 01:22:53.766
Drink his blood after killing them, or return.

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.705
Oh, and...

01:23:04.516 --> 01:23:05.716
stay the night shift.

01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:13.758
And almost forgot.
My name is...

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.676
Allah Akbar. Allah Akbar.

01:24:32.472 --> 01:24:35.550
Allah Akbar. Allah Akbar.
Allah Akbar.

01:24:53.794 --> 01:24:55.386
What were you going to do to my wife?

01:24:58.132 --> 01:24:59.191
This?

01:25:17.685 --> 01:25:18.810
Look at me.

01:25:22.289 --> 01:25:27.249
I'm so sorry.
If only I would have listened.

01:25:28.996 --> 01:25:31.191
If only you had been my priority.

01:25:36.638 --> 01:25:37.934
Stay with me.

01:25:39.239 --> 01:25:41.469
Sorry.

01:25:43.711 --> 01:25:44.837
I must go.

01:28:00.718 --> 01:28:03.914
Opens
big mouth and say "Allah".

01:28:42.626 --> 01:28:45.459
No, no!
Zubri, no!

01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:47.370
Zubri!

01:28:51.636 --> 01:28:53.570
No! No!

01:28:53.772 --> 01:28:54.772
No!

01:28:56.508 --> 01:28:58.270
Zubri, no!

01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:01.801
No! Zubri, Zubri!

01:29:02.913 --> 01:29:04.175
Zubri!

01:29:05.116 --> 01:29:07.676
Zubri!

01:29:40.252 --> 01:29:41.844
Do it and kill me.

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:46.553
I will go to paradise to enjoy my virgin
...

01:29:46.793 --> 01:29:49.591
and pleasures that only
could imagine.

01:29:50.329 --> 01:29:52.125
No, you will not go to paradise.

01:29:53.765 --> 01:29:56.632
This is a preview of what to expect.

01:30:02.808 --> 01:30:05.436
And where you're going, you're the virgin
.

01:30:25.398 --> 01:30:27.298
What I miss most is his smile.

01:30:28.268 --> 01:30:29.825
The truth is that it is my fault that everything ended well
.

01:30:30.136 --> 01:30:31.330
Sorry he's gone,

01:30:31.737 --> 01:30:33.637
but you must have chosen
for some reason.

01:30:34.674 --> 01:30:36.005
Welcome aboard.

01:30:37.176 --> 01:30:38.872
Is an honor to have you.

01:30:41.515 --> 01:30:43.881
Gone, sir.
Is gone,

01:30:44.651 --> 01:30:46.482
but found his replacement.

01:30:46.687 --> 01:30:47.778
Make it investigated.

01:30:48.254 --> 01:30:50.313
Be sure to follow safe.

01:30:52.758 --> 01:30:54.055
Why?

01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:58.333
Most people do not know that there are things
monsters.

01:31:00.567 --> 01:31:01.761
I dread.

01:31:03.737 --> 01:31:05.203
The evil is out there and I'll find
,

01:31:05.261 --> 01:31:07.942
and I'll put it in the place that corresponds
, but do it alone.

01:31:10.576 --> 01:31:11.737
The Devil's pay.

01:31:14.047 --> 01:31:15.639
I know what I'm doing.

01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:17.808
I believe.
