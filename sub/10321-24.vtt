I cross something off my list,
I get a good feeling inside.

a swirly when he was five.

that good feeling too.

[ Gurgling ]

00:28.162 --> 00:31.465
Thanks for cleaning the toilet
before I let Randy
stick my head in it.

No problem. The last guy who got
his head stuck in the toilet...

How do you decide
what you're gonna do next

00:44.312 --> 00:46.314
If it's too personal,
I'll mind my own beeswax.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.949
Well, uh, sometimes karma
gives me a sign,

00:49.016 --> 00:51.585
other times I just
pick one at random.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.223
And sometimes he lets me pick,
but I get a little freaked out
when I play God.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.304
[ Earl Narrating ] As you
might imagine, number 1 on
my list was kind of special--

01:10.371 --> 01:12.973

at the Camden Market.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.877
It was the last bad thing I did
before I discovered karma.

01:16.944 --> 01:22.150
It was about nine months ago.
Low on funds, I was about to
steal 16 ounces of breakfast,

off the lottery ticket that
would change my life forever.

- [ Screaming ]

01:44.037 --> 01:47.675

- It would also lacerate
my spleen and pop my lung.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.411
Stealing that guy's $10
was the last straw.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.446
Karma had
had enough.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.484
Thanks, Crab Man.
It's about time
I did number 1.

01:56.550 --> 02:00.188
Good luck with that. And I hope
I scrubbed that bat disease
out of that toilet.

02:00.254 --> 02:04.091
But if you start seeing
with your ears and whatnot,
get to a doctor.

In my criminal days,

02:05.893 --> 02:08.696

were a pain in my ass.

02:08.762 --> 02:13.934
But since I never saw the guy's
face I stole the 10 bucks from,
I was lucky he kept the tapes.

02:14.001 --> 02:18.138
Thanks for doing this,
Iqball. I think it happened
around 11:00.

of my 20s doing exotic

02:41.629 --> 02:44.265
The pay was good, but when
the opium buzz wears off,

with a tambourine in one hand
and a tiger's junk in the other,

Wait a second.

04:05.979 --> 04:10.318
He was gonna buy a lotto ticket
with that money?
Yeah.

04:10.384 --> 04:15.188
I bought his lotto ticket.
The winning lotto ticket
was supposed to be his.

That's when I realized
I didn't just owe this guy $10--

04:19.360 --> 04:21.629
I owed him every penny I have.

04:27.034 --> 04:30.571
As soon as I realized
the lottery money was supposed
to belong to someone else,

04:30.638 --> 04:35.509
I went to the bank
and got out what I had left
after Uncle Sam took his share.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.279
That's a lot of money
to give away.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.482

wanna keep the money.

I don't know if I'm about
to pass out or fall asleep
from exhaustion,

13:31.979 --> 13:34.414
but it's happenin'.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.454
Huh?
Oh.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.227
I'll give you 1,800 for it
if it runs.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.063
It runs, just not right now.
It's out of gas.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.565
I'll give you 1,785 for it.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.135
Take it, Earl.
You know this car's
not worth more than 1,500.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.704
- 1,500.
- Take it, Earl.
We're desperate.

13:57.770 --> 14:01.308
1,200.
Hurry, Earl. He's lowering
his prices for no reason.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.211
Sold.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.786
It happened, Earl. You crossed
something off your list
and something good happened.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.657
That's a lot of money.
Enough to get all your
piercing holes plugged up.

14:17.724 --> 14:21.761
Yep, it's a lot.
Damn it, Crab Man.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.763
What? Wh-Wh-What
are you doing?

14:23.830 --> 14:25.732
I still owe Paul
five grand, Randy.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.734
No, no.
I need to eat, Earl.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.838
My stomach's making sounds
I never heard it say before.
It's his money, not ours.

14:31.905 --> 14:35.675
But, Earl,
we got no place to live,
no car, no food. We're--

14:35.742 --> 14:40.981
I'm sorry, Randy. Look, I have
no choice. I have to stick to
the list. You gotta believe.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.483
Quit saying that!
I don't believe!

14:43.550 --> 14:47.354
You hear me? I don't believe!
And I don't see how you can
still believe either!

14:47.420 --> 14:51.058
'Cause I got nothin' else,
Randy! This is it.
This is all I have.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.126
I didn't even get
to eat the moth!

14:53.193 --> 14:57.464
Well, lucky you!
It tasted like moth!
Dry moth!

14:57.530 --> 15:00.267
I'm sorry, Randy!

15:00.333 --> 15:02.435
[ Earl Narrating ]
It's scary to see Randy
that upset.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.039
But lucky for me, the dizzy Hulk
had a bad arm and terrible aim.

15:06.106 --> 15:10.677
And lucky for both of us,
about two miles down the road
we found a bus stop.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.150
Pull the cord. Paul's house
is near the next stop.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.620
Pull the cord.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.996
Randy, pull the cord.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.567
Randy! Let me go.
Randy.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.940
Uh, Randy.
[ Grunting ]

15:42.609 --> 15:44.511
Aaah! Randy!

15:44.577 --> 15:48.081
Uh, excuse me. Would you mind
pulling the cord, please?

15:48.148 --> 15:51.318
[ Thuds ]
[ Woman Screams ]

15:57.290 --> 15:59.192
[ Earl Narrating ]
Luckily, Paul didn't die.

15:59.259 --> 16:03.196
But when the force of getting
hit by a bus makes your heart
and liver switch places,

16:03.263 --> 16:05.432
uh, you're gonna feel it.

16:05.498 --> 16:09.436
How you feeling, buddy?
Take the money back.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.971
- What?
- Take the money back.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.541
Okay.
W-Wait. You were
just hit by a bus.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.344
You're still a little out of it.
That money is yours.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.979
You don't know the whole story.
[ Groans ]

16:20.047 --> 16:23.016
[ Earl Narrating ] Turns out
Paul knew more about the day
I won the lottery than I did.

16:23.083 --> 16:28.421
Apparently, when you're blacked
out and laying in the middle of
the road, you miss a few things.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.957
[ Tires Squealing ]
The ticket didn't go far...

16:31.024 --> 16:32.992
before it was in the hands
of someone else.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.995
And that person was faced
with a decision--

16:36.063 --> 16:40.200
Help a guy lying
in the middle of the road
or take the money and run.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.768
[ Tires Squealing ]

16:41.834 --> 16:43.736
Paul decided to run.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.407
[ Bengali ]

16:47.474 --> 16:50.210
Meanwhile, the old lady that
hit me called her sister...

16:50.277 --> 16:52.745
who convinced her to return
to the scene of the accident.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.647
Fine. I'll go back.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.118
But if I go to jail,
you're taking care of Mom.

17:07.494 --> 17:13.233
Paul was making his getaway
with what he thought was
a stolen ticket. He was rich.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.802
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Screaming ]

17:15.868 --> 17:18.238
[ Tires Squealing ]

17:19.839 --> 17:23.110
It was the happiest
three minutes of his life.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.381
And over the next several days,
the ticket made its way
through Camden County,

17:28.448 --> 17:31.418
just waiting for karma to
deliver it to the right person.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.962
If Willie the one-eyed mailman
had better depth perception,

17:43.029 --> 17:45.265
well, that ticket
could have been his.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.112
Some people could've
even quit their day jobs.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.714
But they were too busy
working to notice.

18:33.313 --> 18:37.817
Some people could have had it,
but karma wanted them to find
other things instead.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.722
Things like love.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.836
Other people could have had it
if they just weren't busy
doing the wrong thing.

19:00.473 --> 19:05.912
I got one! Problem Child 2!
I just saved us three dollars!

19:05.978 --> 19:08.881
[ Earl Narrating ]
Yep. A lot of people
could've had that ticket,

19:08.948 --> 19:11.751
but it just wasn't meant to be.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.858
It was almost as if
the ticket knew where
it was supposed to go.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.903
Okay, fine.
You took the lotto ticket
instead of helping me.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.240
But that ticket was yours.
Why don't you want the money?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.442
I don't like
what it did to me.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.511
[ Earl Narrating ]
And then Paul told us how
the money had changed his life.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.616
He got ridiculous new clothes.
[ Mother ]
Paul?

19:43.683 --> 19:47.287
And then he dumped his mom
in a discount nursing home.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.357
Money made Paul
a whole different guy.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.628
Can you spare a dollar?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.897
I can spare thousands of
dollars, but not for you.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.799
Whoa-oa! Oh! Damn it!

20:03.970 --> 20:05.772
[ Woman Screams ]

20:05.838 --> 20:08.207
It was that karma stuff
you told me about, Earl.

20:08.275 --> 20:11.110
This money's not supposed
to be with me.

20:11.177 --> 20:14.347
I have a feeling
that if I keep it
it's gonna kill me.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.383
The money's supposed
to be with you.

20:18.285 --> 20:21.821
Wow, Paul. Thanks a lot.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.823
Me and Randy'll keep using it
to do good things.

20:25.892 --> 20:30.397
Things were back to normal.
Look, Earl.
No cigarette butts.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.666
That's right, Randy.
It was a wild ride,
but everything turned out okay.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.969
Plus, you crossed
three things off your list.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.839
[ Slurred ]
Scoot it, sweetheart.
Move. Come on. Come on.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.475
Check it out.
[ Laughs ]

20:42.542 --> 20:47.079
I'm celebratin'. I just got
my hole piercing license,

20:47.146 --> 20:51.117
which means I'm legal,
unlike you.

20:51.183 --> 20:55.187
Con esto concluimos nuestra
primera temporada de Earl.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Estamos muy agradecido
con su acompañamiento.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.892
Anticipamos verlos
el próximo otoño.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.329
Blah, blah, blah.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.565
[ Laughing ]

21:05.632 --> 21:08.335
[ Earl Narrating ] Yep.
Everything was back to normal.
