00:02.869 --> 00:04.739
[sizzling]

00:05.739 --> 00:06.695
[thunderous explosion]

00:06.739 --> 00:08.086
GIBBS:
It's a list.Of what?

00:08.130 --> 00:10.565
Every Navy warship that contains
the faulty wiring.

00:10.608 --> 00:12.869
Who's behind
the terrorist attack?

00:12.913 --> 00:14.000
His name's Harper Dearing.

00:14.043 --> 00:15.695
GIBBS:
Why would a corporate executive

00:15.739 --> 00:17.217
be terrorizing
U.S. Navy vessels?

00:17.260 --> 00:18.521
I was able to confirm that

00:18.565 --> 00:20.869
this is, in fact,
a Watcher fleet microchip.

00:20.913 --> 00:22.869
-How'd Dearing get one?
-Well, he must have bought it.

00:22.913 --> 00:24.173
You know Dearing had a son
in the Navy, right?

00:24.217 --> 00:25.608
ZIVA:
Just got off the phone

00:25.652 --> 00:26.869
with Director Vance's
security detail.

00:26.913 --> 00:28.304
He insisted on driving home
by himself.

00:28.347 --> 00:29.826
He's disappeared, boss.

00:29.869 --> 00:32.086
ZIVA:
They have no idea where he is.

00:48.217 --> 00:50.782
Well, I hate to do it,

00:50.826 --> 00:52.173
but I'm gonna go through
his luggage.

00:52.217 --> 00:53.695
You've never been bashful

00:53.739 --> 00:55.521
about going through
people's belongings, Tony.

00:55.565 --> 00:56.521
Yeah...

00:56.565 --> 00:57.608
[zipper opening]

00:57.652 --> 00:59.086
but this is
Director Vance's stuff.

00:59.130 --> 01:01.695
Do I really wanna know
if he's a boxer or briefs guy?

01:01.739 --> 01:03.086
You want me to?

01:03.130 --> 01:04.869
No, I got it covered, McCurious.

01:04.913 --> 01:06.782
No, I know this area.

01:06.826 --> 01:08.043
This isn't part of his
usual route home.

01:08.086 --> 01:10.130
We're not even close
to his house.

01:10.173 --> 01:11.391
GIBBS:
We got anything?

01:11.434 --> 01:13.652
Director left his cell phone
in the car, boss.

01:13.695 --> 01:16.521
Mrs. Vance called a couple of
times wondering where he is.

01:16.565 --> 01:17.695
Any prints?

01:17.739 --> 01:19.086
Totally clean.

01:19.130 --> 01:20.130
Gibbs.

01:20.173 --> 01:21.869
Wallace, what
the hell happened?

01:21.913 --> 01:23.478
Well, we landed
at Andrews at 22:30.

01:23.521 --> 01:25.521
I thought we should drive
the Director home,

01:25.565 --> 01:28.347
but he wanted to get his SUV
at the Navy Yard.

01:28.391 --> 01:29.913
How was he when you left him?

01:29.956 --> 01:31.695
Well, he was tired, but fine.

01:31.739 --> 01:33.956
We all were.
It was a long flight.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.739
I was at home at about 0100

01:35.782 --> 01:37.652
when I got a call
from Mrs. Vance.

01:37.695 --> 01:39.304
She was worried.

01:39.347 --> 01:40.652
Wallace, go home.

01:40.695 --> 01:42.521
Go on. Get some rest.

01:44.434 --> 01:46.130
No blood or
signs of a struggle.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.217
I'll call SECNAV.

01:48.260 --> 01:50.521
Get the Director's family
into a hotel,

01:50.565 --> 01:52.304
start a perimeter search,

01:52.347 --> 01:54.739
BOLOs, FBI, police.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.000
On it, boss.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.391
Where are you, Leon?

02:07.913 --> 02:08.913
[grunts]

02:11.739 --> 02:13.565
Hm...

02:13.608 --> 02:14.913
[grunts]

02:22.043 --> 02:23.000
[gasps]

02:29.652 --> 02:31.739
[groans]

03:14.826 --> 03:17.260
No. Nothing yet,
Mr. Secretary.

03:17.304 --> 03:18.652
We're still trying
to reconstruct

03:18.695 --> 03:19.956
Director Vance's movements
last night.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.478
[knocking on door]

03:21.521 --> 03:24.000
Sir, as soon as we know
anything, I'll get back to you.

03:25.304 --> 03:26.695
Yeah, McGee?

03:26.739 --> 03:28.652
We've reviewed
the parking lot security tapes.

03:28.695 --> 03:29.956
The Director went
straight to his SUV,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.652
never entered the building.

03:31.695 --> 03:35.869
He exited the Navy Yard through
the Sixth Street gate at 23:30.

03:35.913 --> 03:37.434
Check the GPS in Vance's car.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.826
See if you can pick up
any stops he made, or his route.

03:39.869 --> 03:41.391
Already on it, boss.

03:41.434 --> 03:43.913
Also, we've got calls out to
Homeland Security and Metro PD

03:43.956 --> 03:45.478
for their street cams, too.

03:47.173 --> 03:48.434
Oh, sorry, Agent McGee.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.608
Doctor.

03:49.652 --> 03:51.260
Hey.

03:51.304 --> 03:54.521
Are you just visiting or do you
already know something I don't?

03:54.565 --> 03:57.347
I can do without
the sarcasm, thank you.

03:57.391 --> 03:58.826
I heard what happened.

03:58.869 --> 04:00.304
Leon's a friend. I just...

04:00.347 --> 04:02.304
I'm here to offer
whatever assistance I can.

04:04.391 --> 04:05.869
[phone ringing]Yeah, okay.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.304
Thanks. Appreciate it.

04:08.956 --> 04:10.130
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

04:10.173 --> 04:13.478
VANCE:
Gibbs, it's Leon.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.913
Director.

04:14.956 --> 04:17.913
VANCE:
I remember leaving
the Navy Yard,

04:17.956 --> 04:19.826
I was almost home.

04:19.869 --> 04:21.434
Somebody flagged me down.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.347
They said they were
having car trouble.

04:23.391 --> 04:25.565
You get a description?

04:25.608 --> 04:27.000
[groaning]

04:27.043 --> 04:28.869
There were three of them.

04:28.913 --> 04:33.652
I woke up here and...
I found a groundskeeper.

04:33.695 --> 04:35.043
That's all I remember,

04:35.086 --> 04:36.956
Medic said it was
a tranquilizer.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.086
Hmm, I think some form
of Kolokol.

04:39.130 --> 04:41.826
You're demonstrating
the side effects, Leon.

04:41.869 --> 04:44.173
If Dearing's involved,
he didn't do this alone.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.652
Yeah, his pockets are deep.

04:45.695 --> 04:47.347
Dearing's got the resources.

04:47.391 --> 04:50.608
Boss, land belongs
to the Whitting family.

04:50.652 --> 04:51.608
It's old-money Virginia.

04:51.652 --> 04:53.130
The cadaver in the box

04:53.173 --> 04:56.086
next to the Director was
Navy Lieutenant Derek Whitting,

04:56.130 --> 04:58.869
laid to rest here
in the family mausoleum.

04:58.913 --> 05:00.391
There a connection?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.739
He was killed ten years ago

05:01.782 --> 05:03.608
on the same ship,
the USS Brandywine,

05:03.652 --> 05:05.652
as Dearing's son Evan.

05:05.695 --> 05:08.173
ZIVA: It's like opening a can
of rancid tuna.

05:08.217 --> 05:11.130
Yeah, I'd prefer rancid tuna.

05:11.173 --> 05:12.826
DUCKY: Careful,
gentlemen, careful.

05:12.869 --> 05:14.521
Huh. Who knew
I'd get so accustomed

05:14.565 --> 05:16.217
to the smell
of rotting flesh?

05:16.260 --> 05:17.695
May I remind you all

05:17.739 --> 05:21.000
that is the intention
of a sarcophagus

05:21.043 --> 05:23.478
to seal in the soul.

05:23.521 --> 05:25.478
Hey, Jethro, take
a look at this.

05:25.521 --> 05:27.000
Find something, Doc?

05:27.043 --> 05:29.565
This is what smells.

05:30.739 --> 05:35.000
It was tucked inside
the mummified remains.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.869
Well, that is not human.

05:36.913 --> 05:41.217
It's a partial jawbone of
a member of the equine family.

05:41.260 --> 05:43.260
What the hell is
Dearing trying to tell us?

05:43.304 --> 05:44.782
That's biblical.

05:44.826 --> 05:46.652
Samson, Judges 15.

05:46.695 --> 05:49.608
"And he finds a new
jawbone of an ass,

05:49.652 --> 05:51.739
put forth his hand,
slew a thousand men."

06:05.478 --> 06:08.782
I don't care how much death
we see every day, Doctor,

06:08.826 --> 06:10.217
Director Vance waking up
in a casket

06:10.260 --> 06:13.304
is just plain creepy.

06:13.347 --> 06:16.043
Creepier still is using
Whitting's remains

06:16.086 --> 06:18.434
to deliver a message.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.173
He doesn't seem to have left us
anything else to find.

06:21.217 --> 06:22.652
Here.

06:22.695 --> 06:25.913
I heard that Whitting
and Dearing's son were killed

06:25.956 --> 06:27.478
aboard the same ship?

06:27.521 --> 06:29.043
Yes, a senseless act
of terrorism

06:29.086 --> 06:31.130
against the USS Brandywine.

06:31.173 --> 06:34.217
This time, it was a defective
section of steel in the hull

06:34.260 --> 06:38.347
that was exploited
by those responsible.

06:38.391 --> 06:40.565
Of course, the Navy planned
to repair it,

06:40.608 --> 06:44.913
but it was never considered
a danger, only a vulnerability.

06:44.956 --> 06:47.695
Six dead and 22 injured

06:47.739 --> 06:49.739
on that fateful day.

06:49.782 --> 06:52.739
So, out of the six, why use
Lieutenant Whitting?

06:52.782 --> 06:54.391
First to go, Palmer.

06:54.434 --> 06:57.217
Whitting was on the same deck
where the bomb hit.

06:57.260 --> 06:58.434
Well, that would
certainly provide

06:58.478 --> 07:01.782
a certain
psychological relevance.

07:01.826 --> 07:06.347
If Whitting was indeed the first
to suffer in the explosion,

07:06.391 --> 07:09.260
perhaps Dearing is now
pointing a finger

07:09.304 --> 07:11.434
at who might suffer next.

07:12.478 --> 07:13.782
NCIS.

07:13.826 --> 07:16.043
Why?

07:16.086 --> 07:17.304
It's not like
we were responsible

07:17.347 --> 07:18.739
for what happened
on the Brandywine.

07:18.782 --> 07:22.000
Not directly.

07:24.434 --> 07:26.391
Is it me, or are the chances of
us getting to Palmer's wedding

07:26.434 --> 07:27.826
looking pretty slim shady.

07:27.869 --> 07:29.739
Jimmy will be devastated
if we're not there.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.956
No, no, no, Jimmy does know
what we're up against right now.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.434
You got anything
on Dearing's location?

07:34.478 --> 07:35.826
Nothing yet, boss.

07:35.869 --> 07:37.608
All previous cell phones
have been disconnected.

07:37.652 --> 07:39.043
BOLOs are out across the board.

07:39.086 --> 07:41.782
And all the private airports
are covered.

07:41.826 --> 07:44.826
I need you to an old case file
from 12 years ago.

07:44.869 --> 07:47.391
On it, boss. Details?

07:47.434 --> 07:50.217
Three young sailors played a
practical joke on some officers.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.217
They violated federal law.

07:52.260 --> 07:54.043
Didn't go over well
with the brass.

07:54.086 --> 07:55.652
The case agent was Blake Larson.

07:55.695 --> 07:58.347
Retired Special Agent Larson.

07:58.391 --> 08:00.260
And you think this
has something to do

08:00.304 --> 08:01.434
with what is happening now?

08:01.478 --> 08:04.739
Find it.

08:08.391 --> 08:11.304
Doc, let's talk
about Dearing's son.

08:14.347 --> 08:15.739
You Parker?

08:15.782 --> 08:18.434
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

08:18.478 --> 08:19.347
Nice to meet you, Parker.

08:19.391 --> 08:22.260
So, how much do you like my mom?

08:22.304 --> 08:23.652
I like her.

08:23.695 --> 08:25.043
On a scale of one to ten.

08:25.086 --> 08:26.521
You can round up,
if you want.

08:26.565 --> 08:27.913
I don't do numbers.

08:27.956 --> 08:31.130
Right. Mr. Tactile.

08:31.173 --> 08:33.434
You know,
I heard about that.

08:33.478 --> 08:36.130
The wood stuff,
in your basement.

08:36.173 --> 08:38.391
Yeah?

08:38.434 --> 08:42.347
So I got the closest thing
they had to healthy.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.217
Wow. You're here,

08:44.260 --> 08:46.391
and you met.

08:46.434 --> 08:47.565
Great.

08:47.608 --> 08:48.608
We need to talk.

08:48.652 --> 08:52.130
Okay. Um...

08:53.434 --> 08:55.086
Oh, you can talk.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.956
Parker probably has a higher
security clearance than you do.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.391
Parker, drink.

09:00.434 --> 09:01.260
What's up?

09:01.304 --> 09:02.956
Evan Dearing.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, I gave you his file.

09:05.043 --> 09:06.391
Yeah, I need more.

09:06.434 --> 09:08.565
More...?More, Doc.

09:08.608 --> 09:12.304
More what, personal information?

09:12.347 --> 09:14.260
Education, sexual preferences?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.304
More. All of it, Doc.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.826
Okay.

09:18.869 --> 09:20.478
Uh, in case you haven't noticed,

09:20.521 --> 09:23.739
I kind of get
a big kick out of the why?

09:23.782 --> 09:27.521
Dearing has been digging up
Navy weaknesses.

09:27.565 --> 09:30.130
Hitting us
where it hurts.

09:30.173 --> 09:33.391
I think it's time
we return the favor.

09:33.434 --> 09:35.956
You wanted to see me, Abby?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.608
[groans]

09:37.652 --> 09:39.086
Uh-oh.

09:39.130 --> 09:40.652
This is an assault, Ziva.

09:40.695 --> 09:43.304
It's an assault on everything
that's good in the world.

09:43.347 --> 09:46.260
Abby, everyone is upset by what
Harper Dearing has done.

09:46.304 --> 09:48.173
Oh.

09:48.217 --> 09:49.565
I-I wasn't
talking about that.

09:49.608 --> 09:51.347
I mean, that is terrible,

09:51.391 --> 09:53.086
and we have to stop this maniac

09:53.130 --> 09:56.565
before any more Navy men
and women are lost.

09:56.608 --> 09:59.565
Abby...But now, right before
Jimmy's wedding?

09:59.608 --> 10:00.782
Abby...

10:00.826 --> 10:02.956
I know it sounds selfish
at a time like this,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.826
but I was just really looking
forward to happy time

10:05.869 --> 10:06.913
for our little family.

10:06.956 --> 10:10.043
Abby! Enough! Work!
Okay.

10:10.086 --> 10:12.565
So we know it's a jawbone
of a horse, right?

10:12.608 --> 10:15.521
So I did measurements and
extracted DNA from the marrow,

10:15.565 --> 10:20.130
and I came up with these two
four-legged beauties.

10:20.173 --> 10:22.043
It's a close match
to a thoroughbred Morgan

10:22.086 --> 10:24.000
or an Anglo-Arabian.

10:24.043 --> 10:26.217
Both are very common
in racing circles.

10:26.260 --> 10:28.000
So we need to check
breeders and race tracks.

10:28.043 --> 10:29.304
And veterinarians.

10:29.347 --> 10:31.782
If we found out where
the horse came from,

10:31.826 --> 10:32.956
we could find Dearing.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.347
Hopefully.

10:34.391 --> 10:36.782
All right, go, Ziva. Shoo.

10:36.826 --> 10:38.565
We have a plane to catch.

10:38.608 --> 10:41.478
I am holding out hope for
a piece of wedding cake.

10:41.521 --> 10:43.521
[chuckling]

10:50.043 --> 10:52.391
All right, got it.

10:52.434 --> 10:55.217
Oh, wow. Nice.

10:55.260 --> 10:57.434
Illegal wire case
from 2000.

10:57.478 --> 10:59.782
The case agent was
Special Agent Blake Larson.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.652
Retired the year
after I started.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.434
Gibbs was
a participating agent.

11:04.478 --> 11:06.043
Involved a steamy liaison

11:06.086 --> 11:08.434
between a male
and female officer.

11:08.478 --> 11:10.434
Someone videotaped them
making it a felony.

11:10.478 --> 11:12.478
Then played it for
the whole crew to see.

11:12.521 --> 11:14.608
Well, there's no
hard copy of that, is there?

11:14.652 --> 11:17.000
Hey, I think we should
probably try and find that

11:17.043 --> 11:18.434
on the Internet.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.434
No. Thankfully, this was before
YouTube or Facebook.

11:20.478 --> 11:21.782
Oh.

11:21.826 --> 11:24.217
A couple of co-conspirators
flipped on the sailor

11:24.260 --> 11:26.391
responsible for
capturing the moment.

11:26.434 --> 11:27.739
Cecil B. was discharged.

11:27.782 --> 11:29.695
Doesn't say here what
happened to the others.

11:30.869 --> 11:32.826
Uh, reassigned.

11:32.869 --> 11:35.043
Does your file got any names?

11:35.086 --> 11:36.782
Well, someone had some pull.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.521
Names were
legally expunged.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.739
But Gibbs kept good records.

11:40.782 --> 11:43.391
Seamen Jeffrey DeRosa and...

11:43.434 --> 11:45.304
Evan Dearing.

11:47.130 --> 11:49.434
RYAN:
So, after the investigation,

11:49.478 --> 11:52.304
Dearing's son was reassigned
to the USS Brandywine.

11:52.347 --> 11:55.173
Harper Dearing made sure his
son's record wasn't tarnished.

11:55.217 --> 11:56.521
He was a concerned father.

11:56.565 --> 11:57.869
RYAN:
Yeah. Navy...

11:57.913 --> 12:00.217
seemed to be willing
to forget. Gibbs didn't.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.695
Nah, just took
me awhile.

12:01.739 --> 12:03.347
So you think that

12:03.391 --> 12:05.434
his father is targeting NCIS

12:05.478 --> 12:07.347
in retaliation for the son
being reassigned

12:07.391 --> 12:09.000
to that destroyer?

12:09.043 --> 12:11.347
Yeah.

12:11.391 --> 12:12.869
That's our supposition.

12:12.913 --> 12:14.652
What we think.Special Agent Larson's

12:14.695 --> 12:16.260
retired now.

12:16.304 --> 12:19.304
When he's not playing the
ponies, he's raising them.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.521
He lives on a horse
farm in Harwood, Maryland.

12:21.565 --> 12:23.391
Horses.

12:23.434 --> 12:25.565
I'm detecting a theme.

12:25.608 --> 12:27.217
Gibbs, talk to Larson.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.521
Tell him what's happening.

12:28.565 --> 12:30.347
He might remember
something about Dearing

12:30.391 --> 12:33.260
that could
give us the upper hand.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.000
Beautiful.

12:40.043 --> 12:43.260
ZIVA:
I understand retiring here.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.173
TONY:
Ah, yes. Manure and
a government pension.

12:46.217 --> 12:47.521
What more could
a girl ask for?

12:47.565 --> 12:49.173
ZIVA:
Tony, it saddens me
you cannot appreciate

12:49.217 --> 12:50.782
the simpler things in life.

12:50.826 --> 12:52.652
Oh, I appreciate
simple, Ziva.

12:52.695 --> 12:54.565
When I retire,
it will be to a

12:54.608 --> 12:55.826
simple tropical island

12:55.869 --> 12:57.521
with simple topless
women fanning me

12:57.565 --> 12:59.695
with simple banana leaves
until the day I die.

12:59.739 --> 13:01.260
Kind of predictable,
isn't it, Tony?

13:01.304 --> 13:04.478
TONY:
Well, there's something
nice about predictable.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.391
Something wrong, boss?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.434
Larson!

13:28.478 --> 13:30.739
Are you home?

13:59.043 --> 14:01.869
Larson wasn't
even an agent anymore.

14:03.565 --> 14:05.478
You're always an Agent, DiNozzo.

14:05.521 --> 14:06.695
Could have blown any time.

14:06.739 --> 14:07.956
How did Dearing
know we were here?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.130
Boss, we found
something.

14:11.173 --> 14:12.826
ZIVA: We were searching
the perimeter.

14:12.869 --> 14:14.347
Located it over there.

14:14.391 --> 14:15.869
You check it out,
make sure it's not rigged?

14:15.913 --> 14:16.913
Ziva already did.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.086
ZIVA:
He was watching us, Gibbs.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.826
McGEE [over video]:
Something wrong, boss?

14:25.869 --> 14:27.956
GIBBS [over video]:
Larson, are you home?Saw the whole thing.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.478
Hello, Agent Gibbs.

14:34.521 --> 14:36.869
Some people need to learn
from their mistakes.

14:36.913 --> 14:40.000
Others don't deserve
the opportunity...

14:40.043 --> 14:41.173
like former Agent Larson there.

14:41.217 --> 14:44.260
The terrorist attack

14:44.304 --> 14:47.956
that killed my son, Evan,
did not need to happen.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.782
These recent attacks,

14:49.826 --> 14:51.956
the vulnerabilities
that I have pointed out,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.869
they needed to be disclosed.

14:53.913 --> 14:55.913
In sacrificing a few,

14:55.956 --> 14:58.826
I have saved
thousands of lives.

14:58.869 --> 15:02.043
And now it's time
to stop pointing out flaws.

15:02.086 --> 15:04.478
Now...

15:04.521 --> 15:07.173
it's about something else
entirely.

15:07.217 --> 15:10.173
Now it's about Evan.

15:13.043 --> 15:15.478
You want to talk
about it?

15:18.521 --> 15:20.739
Worldwide Fleet Command's
on red alert.

15:20.782 --> 15:23.869
We're securing all
vessels and ports.

15:23.913 --> 15:25.391
So what's your next play?

15:25.434 --> 15:26.913
GIBBS:
The ex-wife.

15:26.956 --> 15:28.043
She's travelling
out of the country.

15:28.086 --> 15:29.043
She'll be back today.

15:29.086 --> 15:31.304
You and ex-wives.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.391
If there's anybody
who knows

15:32.434 --> 15:33.826
what makes the
son of a bitch tick,

15:33.869 --> 15:35.391
it could be her.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.695
You know, you got caught.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.173
Okay. It doesn't matter.

15:42.217 --> 15:44.826
The hell it doesn't matter.

15:46.043 --> 15:48.173
Dearing played me, Gibbs.
Nobody plays me.

15:48.217 --> 15:49.826
Don't let it happen again.

15:49.869 --> 15:51.043
Trust me, it won't.

15:51.086 --> 15:52.782
It's all a game
to him, Leon.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.608
Hit back.

15:54.652 --> 15:56.521
You hit back hard.

15:56.565 --> 15:59.434
You remember what
that used to feel like?

16:01.913 --> 16:05.043
I know what you're capable of.

16:05.086 --> 16:07.347
I got a thousand
agents worldwide

16:07.391 --> 16:09.826
willing to take a bullet for me.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.608
Yeah. And?

16:11.652 --> 16:13.173
And I can't protect them

16:13.217 --> 16:16.000
from one lone, deranged father.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.956
Hey, Leon, if it makes you
feel any better,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.565
I wouldn't take
a bullet for you.

16:21.608 --> 16:23.173
[raspy laugh]

16:26.782 --> 16:29.260
I want him gone.

16:32.608 --> 16:34.739
McGEE:
Boss, meet Victoria Dearing.

16:34.782 --> 16:36.869
It appears husband and wife
dealt with the loss

16:36.913 --> 16:38.043
in different ways.

16:38.086 --> 16:39.608
After Evan died,
the former Mrs. Dearing

16:39.652 --> 16:40.913
immediately sought counseling.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.869
Tried to move on.

16:42.913 --> 16:44.956
Yeah, well,
the husband didn't.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.304
McGEE:
Harper refused and
started drinking.

16:46.347 --> 16:48.260
He got himself
a couple of DUIs.

16:48.304 --> 16:50.000
Became increasingly
withdrawn and violent.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.826
Two years after
Evan's passing, they divorced.

16:51.869 --> 16:53.826
McGEE:
Victoria now lives

16:53.869 --> 16:55.260
in a small home
near Arlington.

16:55.304 --> 16:56.565
Bring her in.

16:56.608 --> 16:57.695
ZIVA:
Tony's getting her.

16:57.739 --> 16:58.695
They're on their way.

16:58.739 --> 17:00.695
Uh, Gibbs?

17:00.739 --> 17:02.478
We have a question.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.478
And I know there's
no good time to ask this.

17:05.521 --> 17:08.391
But we just...
we need an answer.

17:08.434 --> 17:10.913
All of us.

17:12.869 --> 17:14.304
Is there any chance...

17:14.347 --> 17:17.956
that we'll still make it
to Jimmy's wedding?

17:24.217 --> 17:26.347
Totally understand,
Agent Gibbs.

17:27.086 --> 17:29.043
Of course.

17:29.086 --> 17:31.913
JIMMY: The timing couldn't
have been worse.

17:31.956 --> 17:34.695
It's okay.
It's okay.

17:34.739 --> 17:37.869
I-I guess this-- it, it
just wasn't meant to be.

17:39.478 --> 17:41.260
So I'm gonna go down
to Autopsy,

17:41.304 --> 17:44.434
uh, 'cause
Dr. Mallard is, um,

17:44.478 --> 17:47.043
there.

17:49.043 --> 17:51.000
Jimmy...

17:53.347 --> 17:55.347
[typing]

17:58.043 --> 18:01.000
Yet another piece of
some sort of decorative

18:01.043 --> 18:02.956
collector's plate.
So, based

18:03.000 --> 18:04.782
on what we've extracted
from the body so far,

18:04.826 --> 18:06.956
we know that, at the time
of the explosion,

18:07.000 --> 18:07.956
Special Agent Larson had

18:08.000 --> 18:09.782
a television,

18:09.826 --> 18:10.956
an oak table,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.217
and a love for festive
Western dinnerware.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.043
[sighs]

18:16.086 --> 18:17.521
Speaking of love, Doctor,

18:17.565 --> 18:18.913
I need your opinion
on something.

18:18.956 --> 18:20.304
Mr. Palmer,
as tedious

18:20.347 --> 18:22.782
as this may seem, this is
not the time to discuss

18:22.826 --> 18:25.434
your inexplicable
desire to perform

18:25.478 --> 18:28.478
a Bette Midler number at
your wedding ceremony.

18:28.521 --> 18:30.347
I want to sing "Wind Beneath
My Wings" to my bride.

18:30.391 --> 18:31.347
So sue me.

18:31.391 --> 18:33.000
I... I'm sorry,
Dr. Mallard,

18:33.043 --> 18:34.782
I've been under a lot
of stress lately.

18:34.826 --> 18:36.956
I...
You are not the only
one with a burden.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.826
Now, please, it is
imperative I find something

18:39.869 --> 18:40.913
to aid the
investigation.

18:40.956 --> 18:42.043
It is on my shoulders

18:42.086 --> 18:44.043
to protect those
who protect us.

18:44.086 --> 18:45.173
No.

18:45.217 --> 18:48.347
I-- no, Doctor,

18:48.391 --> 18:50.869
it's on ourshoulders.

18:50.913 --> 18:53.130
And that is why
I'm wondering,

18:53.173 --> 18:55.826
do you think that I should
just cancel the wedding?

18:55.869 --> 18:57.869
Absolutely not.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.217
No one can deny that
our work is important,

19:02.260 --> 19:04.000
but we also
have loved ones

19:04.043 --> 19:06.826
who are not to be
taken for granted.

19:06.869 --> 19:08.956
To walk away
now is to hand

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Harper Dearing
another victory.

19:11.043 --> 19:15.869
You're right, of course.

19:15.913 --> 19:18.565
Just the thought of my wedding
without any of you there--

19:18.608 --> 19:20.304
it just...

19:20.347 --> 19:21.695
feels wrong.

19:21.739 --> 19:23.608
Did I not just say--

19:23.652 --> 19:26.260
and rather poetically,
I might add--

19:26.304 --> 19:27.782
that we have loved ones

19:27.826 --> 19:30.347
who are not to be
taken for granted?

19:30.391 --> 19:35.000
Yeah, yeah, you did, but...

19:35.043 --> 19:37.000
Wait, you mean
you'll be there?

19:37.043 --> 19:38.000
[chuckles]

19:38.043 --> 19:40.000
With proverbial
bells on.

19:41.826 --> 19:44.826
[both laughing]

19:44.869 --> 19:47.782
GIBBS:
It's your ex, Harper Dearing--

19:47.826 --> 19:50.217
he's the main suspect in
a series of explosions

19:50.260 --> 19:53.086
aboard U.S. Navy vessels.

19:53.130 --> 19:56.652
That's not possible.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.347
Evan's death
destroyed Harper.

20:00.391 --> 20:03.956
Your husband ever talk about
his anger toward the Navy

20:04.000 --> 20:05.826
about not being able
to protect your son?

20:05.869 --> 20:07.521
Harper put on
a good face

20:07.565 --> 20:12.478
for years after the attack,
but, oh, he was, he was angry,

20:12.521 --> 20:14.565
especially at the Navy.

20:15.608 --> 20:17.565
Your son was
important to him.

20:17.608 --> 20:19.173
Harper...

20:19.217 --> 20:22.956
called him
his shining star.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.782
Said he was the first thing
he thought about

20:24.826 --> 20:26.130
in the morning
and the last thing

20:26.173 --> 20:28.173
when he went
to sleep at night.

20:28.217 --> 20:31.000
Doesn't leave a lot of
room for you, does it?

20:35.652 --> 20:38.347
Evan was the one good thing
that held us together,

20:38.391 --> 20:41.782
and when he died,

20:41.826 --> 20:45.217
all that was good
in Harper died, too.

20:46.260 --> 20:49.086
You have any idea
where he is now?

20:49.130 --> 20:50.434
None.

20:50.478 --> 20:54.260
But if he is the one
behind these explosions,

20:54.304 --> 20:57.826
I know h-he won't stop
until he's made his point.

20:57.869 --> 21:00.869
Yeah, what point is that?

21:01.913 --> 21:05.000
That someone has to pay

21:05.043 --> 21:07.217
for taking away our son.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.391
[typing]

21:10.434 --> 21:11.434
[door slams]

21:12.652 --> 21:14.260
Don't you ever knock?

21:14.304 --> 21:16.478
You called me.

21:16.521 --> 21:18.739
Well, what if I was indisposed?

21:18.782 --> 21:20.608
That would be even better.

21:20.652 --> 21:22.652
Down, boy.

21:24.086 --> 21:26.043
I want you to
meet someone.

21:26.086 --> 21:27.826
Who?

21:27.869 --> 21:29.826
Meet Lucy.

21:29.869 --> 21:31.956
We're the only ones here.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.913
She's the computer.

21:33.956 --> 21:36.608
Her technical name

21:36.652 --> 21:40.086
is a paragraph long,
but I just call her Lucy.

21:40.130 --> 21:43.608
You know, "Five cents,
the doctor is in."

21:43.652 --> 21:47.130
She is programmed for
the sole purpose of getting

21:47.173 --> 21:49.000
inside people's heads.

21:49.043 --> 21:50.304
Ah, your kind of gal.

21:50.347 --> 21:52.608
So, what have
you told her?

21:52.652 --> 21:54.956
Uh, Dearing's
personal information.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.391
And Lucy's telling us
Dearing's likes and dislikes.

21:59.434 --> 22:00.739
Favorite ice cream,

22:00.782 --> 22:02.782
sleep habits,
political leanings.

22:02.826 --> 22:05.086
Anything relevant?The relevance is

22:05.130 --> 22:08.782
that Lucy knows people
that Dearing might trust

22:08.826 --> 22:10.391
or distrust.

22:10.434 --> 22:13.956
His possible allies or enemies,
statistically speaking.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Enemies like me.
Yes.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.913
And allies like...

22:17.956 --> 22:19.826
Jonathan Cole.

22:19.869 --> 22:21.913
Name ring a bell?

22:21.956 --> 22:24.695
Several.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.347
Phantom Eight.

22:27.391 --> 22:29.130
And currently locked up

22:29.173 --> 22:31.304
where he should be,
thanks to you.

22:31.347 --> 22:33.782
He sold Dearing the microchip.

22:33.826 --> 22:35.260
Yeah, they have a history.

22:35.304 --> 22:37.869
Both enemies of NCIS.

22:37.913 --> 22:41.000
Apparently, Dearing
did some checking.

22:41.043 --> 22:42.478
He wanted to hire Cole.

22:42.521 --> 22:46.782
If we could get Dearing
to enlist Cole's services now,

22:46.826 --> 22:48.913
you know, maybe we could
turn the tables on him.

22:48.956 --> 22:51.434
Get him out of prison,

22:51.478 --> 22:53.608
[phone ringing]work him like a double agent.

22:53.652 --> 22:55.173
Excuse me.

22:55.217 --> 22:56.826
Ryan.

22:56.869 --> 22:58.043
DEARING:
Good evening, Doctor.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.130
Dearing?

23:00.173 --> 23:03.086
You had to know that I'd call.

23:06.086 --> 23:08.217
I suspected, eventually.

23:08.260 --> 23:10.565
I must say, Doctor,

23:10.608 --> 23:12.782
you continue to intrigue me.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.956
Why is that,
my winning personality?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.782
Start a trace on
Dr. Ryan's phone.

23:17.826 --> 23:20.434
I've worked with some
very smart people.

23:20.478 --> 23:25.826
Brilliant thinkers
who influence how we live.

23:25.869 --> 23:29.782
You get great pleasure getting
inside people's heads.

23:29.826 --> 23:33.043
And yet, you're an open book...

23:33.086 --> 23:35.782
weak, vulnerable.

23:35.826 --> 23:38.130
Yeah, don't kid yourself.

23:38.173 --> 23:39.608
You don't know me.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.608
I know about your ex-husband.

23:42.652 --> 23:46.217
Where he is
and how he got there.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.782
Stay away from my family.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.695
As a single parent,
you're doing an excellent job.

23:50.739 --> 23:53.391
Parker has a...
has an honest face,

23:53.434 --> 23:54.695
a winning smile.

23:54.739 --> 23:56.391
I see he plays a woodwind.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.391
You know,
I used to play the clarinet.

23:58.434 --> 24:00.000
You're at his music school?

24:01.260 --> 24:04.000
Yeah, he seems to be waiting
for you.

24:04.043 --> 24:07.695
Would you like me to tell him
that you're running a bit late?

24:18.043 --> 24:19.391
He's okay, Doc.

24:19.434 --> 24:21.478
I know.

24:21.521 --> 24:24.260
I know.
Dearing didn't go near him.

24:24.304 --> 24:25.478
[sighs heavily]

24:25.521 --> 24:27.521
That's what concerns me.

24:29.565 --> 24:31.130
Why?

24:31.173 --> 24:33.434
He's playing us.

24:33.478 --> 24:37.521
Finding ships' vulnerabilities
isn't his only specialty.

24:37.565 --> 24:40.434
He's good.
He's really good.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.608
He's dangerous, too.

24:59.869 --> 25:01.434
Morning.

25:01.478 --> 25:03.043
You been here all night?

25:03.086 --> 25:06.304
Yeah. Yeah, I had some work
to finish up.

25:06.347 --> 25:09.304
Dr. Mallard and I have a
flight in, uh, two hours.

25:09.347 --> 25:11.304
He's coming with me.

25:11.347 --> 25:14.391
Um, but I-I got
your text.

25:14.434 --> 25:16.521
Uh, you guys need me
for something?

25:16.565 --> 25:18.913
We know you're going through
with the wedding.

25:18.956 --> 25:20.608
Yeah, hey, I
totally understand.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.565
You guys can't come.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.478
Which is why we wanted
to personally see you off.

25:24.521 --> 25:26.782
And...

25:28.565 --> 25:30.913
...give you

25:30.956 --> 25:32.347
our wedding gifts.

25:32.391 --> 25:34.347
Ziva. I don't even
know what to say.

25:34.391 --> 25:36.086
I'm gonna open
it, obviously.

25:36.130 --> 25:37.391
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

25:37.434 --> 25:39.304
Actually, you should open it
with your bride.

25:39.347 --> 25:41.130
Right. Yeah.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.347
But I will tell you
what it is.

25:43.391 --> 25:44.695
The finest Israeli
cotton sheets,

25:44.739 --> 25:48.173
so you sleep like a baby.

25:48.217 --> 25:49.478
[whispers]:
Or maybe make one.

25:49.521 --> 25:51.434
[laughs]

25:51.478 --> 25:53.043
Yeah. I'm a little
anxious about that part.

25:53.086 --> 25:55.434
You know, expectations are high.

25:55.478 --> 25:59.260
This is a wireless
long-range security camera.

25:59.304 --> 26:01.478
For those nights
when you're working here

26:01.521 --> 26:03.304
and Breena's
stuck home alone.

26:03.347 --> 26:05.304
Also, you can eventually use it
as a baby monitor.

26:05.347 --> 26:07.347
That is awesome, Tim.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.173
I...

26:09.217 --> 26:10.869
I'm speechless.

26:10.913 --> 26:12.391
Well, you won't be speechless
for long,

26:12.434 --> 26:13.478
my little Autopsy Gremlin.

26:13.521 --> 26:15.521
Huh? The gift that keeps
on giving.

26:15.565 --> 26:16.739
What is that, a movie?

26:16.782 --> 26:19.043
No. It's a film.

26:19.086 --> 26:22.478
The 1963 Jean-Luc Godard
masterpiece, Contempt.

26:22.521 --> 26:23.739
You got that at Christmas.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.478
You're re-gifting, Tony.

26:25.521 --> 26:27.478
It's not re-gifting if you've
already watched it on Netflix.

26:27.521 --> 26:29.434
Tony, thank you.
Come here.

26:29.478 --> 26:31.043
Oh, come on.

26:31.086 --> 26:32.391
You guys, bring it in.

26:32.434 --> 26:33.782
Come on, everybody.Bring it in.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.391
It's a group grope.

26:35.434 --> 26:36.565
[Ziva chuckling]

26:36.608 --> 26:38.652
Hey.

26:49.521 --> 26:51.217
Mmm.

26:51.260 --> 26:52.826
Sour cream and onion.

26:52.869 --> 26:55.434
You know, everything really does
taste better on the outside.

26:58.608 --> 27:00.565
Way I'm chewing
tell you my dad

27:00.608 --> 27:02.608
didn't hug me enough
as a kid, Doc?

27:02.652 --> 27:04.739
Tells me he wasn't
big on manners.

27:04.782 --> 27:07.304
Oh, no,
he was plenty big on manners.

27:07.347 --> 27:09.043
I just wasn't big on listening.

27:18.434 --> 27:21.130
Hmm, sad story.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.478
You should know,
you wrote it.

27:23.521 --> 27:25.521
You give me too much credit.

27:25.565 --> 27:28.739
You and Latham sold
Harper Dearing the microchip.

27:28.782 --> 27:32.826
You handed him the
fleet's weaknesses.

27:32.869 --> 27:35.000
You made this possible.

27:38.739 --> 27:41.739
You're right, Gibbs.

27:42.782 --> 27:44.608
I do know things.

27:44.652 --> 27:46.347
Things about Dearing.

27:46.391 --> 27:48.739
Things that could help you
catch him.

27:48.782 --> 27:50.304
He's bluffing.

27:50.347 --> 27:52.565
He doesn't know crap.

27:52.608 --> 27:55.826
Well, then pray tell,
why am I here?

27:56.869 --> 27:59.043
Penance.

27:59.086 --> 28:03.304
We want you to offer your
services to Dearing,

28:03.347 --> 28:05.521
and lure him into a trap.

28:05.565 --> 28:07.478
Hang on a second here.

28:07.521 --> 28:09.304
You're recruiting me?

28:09.347 --> 28:11.043
Well, yeah, Cole.

28:11.086 --> 28:13.869
There weren't a whole lot
of other candidates.

28:13.913 --> 28:16.043
And if it works?Maybe,

28:16.086 --> 28:18.521
just maybe,

28:18.565 --> 28:23.347
we can talk about putting a
light at the end of your tunnel.

28:23.391 --> 28:25.739
Maybe keep you away
from the firing squad.

28:32.913 --> 28:34.347
You know,

28:34.391 --> 28:37.782
my old man did pass along
one pearl of wisdom.

28:37.826 --> 28:41.086
Even a bad hand can win the pot.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.478
So, what's the catch?

28:45.521 --> 28:48.086
You could get killed.

28:48.130 --> 28:50.434
That's not the catch.

28:50.478 --> 28:53.739
That's the fun.

28:53.782 --> 28:55.826
TONY: Wheels of injustice are turning

28:55.869 --> 28:56.956
as we speak, boss.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.434
The phony
brief leaked?

28:58.478 --> 29:00.652
Uh, well, federal agencies
are on the look out for Cole.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.130
As far as they're concerned,

29:02.173 --> 29:04.695
he's escaped and is somewhere
in the tristate area.

29:04.739 --> 29:07.086
Well, that should pique
Dearing's interest.

29:07.130 --> 29:08.782
Yeah, I also talked
to Victoria Dearing

29:08.826 --> 29:11.695
and told her that Cole
is looking for her ex.

29:11.739 --> 29:13.347
Yeah, think she'll
pass it on?

29:13.391 --> 29:14.521
I think she knows more
than she's telling us.

29:14.565 --> 29:16.652
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.

29:16.695 --> 29:17.869
Abbs, Abbs, go.

29:17.913 --> 29:19.434
I ran all the samples

29:19.478 --> 29:21.347
from the fire
at Agent Larson's house.

29:21.391 --> 29:23.304
None of them matched
the accelerant

29:23.347 --> 29:24.608
used in any of the other fires.

29:24.652 --> 29:26.521
Could be another test, boss.

29:26.565 --> 29:30.130
Hasn't Harper Dearing
tested us enough?

29:30.173 --> 29:32.826
No, I think he's just
getting started.

29:35.521 --> 29:37.478
Director Vance.

29:38.652 --> 29:39.739
You got a new
parking spot?

29:39.782 --> 29:41.173
It's temporary,

29:41.217 --> 29:42.782
while security's on high alert.

29:42.826 --> 29:44.347
You got anything?

29:44.391 --> 29:46.826
Cheese or peanut butter, Leon?

29:46.869 --> 29:49.652
My mousetrap--
always cheddar.

29:49.695 --> 29:50.869
Hope it works.

29:50.913 --> 29:52.913
[phone buzzing]

30:02.000 --> 30:03.521
Hey.

30:03.565 --> 30:04.521
You okay?

30:12.086 --> 30:13.956
Who is Liam Dunn?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.304
He's my ex-husband.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.478
Yeah, and?

30:18.521 --> 30:21.739
And he's released
from prison today,

30:21.782 --> 30:25.391
by a federal judge
on a bogus technicality.

30:25.434 --> 30:27.478
That's bad timing.

30:27.521 --> 30:28.869
Timing had nothing
to do with it.

30:28.913 --> 30:31.043
You sure about that?

30:31.086 --> 30:34.608
Parker's father was in prison
for a reason.

30:34.652 --> 30:37.043
A very good reason.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.739
He hurts people.

30:38.782 --> 30:40.521
You're safe.

30:40.565 --> 30:42.347
Parker's safe.

30:42.391 --> 30:45.000
I can promise that.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.391
No, you can't.

30:46.434 --> 30:49.043
I know you want to, Gibbs,
but you can't.

30:49.086 --> 30:51.434
This is like classic
headgamer stuff, Doc.

30:51.478 --> 30:54.260
Don't let Dearing inside
your head like this.

30:54.304 --> 30:56.521
Dearing bought the judge.

30:56.565 --> 30:59.565
He played me and he won.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.130
No.

31:01.173 --> 31:02.391
He hasn't won anything.

31:04.782 --> 31:06.434
I'm taking Parker.

31:06.478 --> 31:08.217
There's nothing else you can do.

31:08.260 --> 31:09.521
I've got to go.

31:22.913 --> 31:25.478
SECDEF will know where I am.

31:28.347 --> 31:30.347
This isn't the answer.

31:48.652 --> 31:50.304
[sighs]

31:50.347 --> 31:51.565
Please.

31:51.608 --> 31:53.739
Who really likes weddings,
anyway?

31:53.782 --> 31:55.913
Hmm. There's nothing good
about them.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.391
Weird uncles who make
inappropriate toasts.

31:58.434 --> 32:00.086
Rubber chicken enhanced
by cheap wine.

32:00.130 --> 32:02.130
Cheesy music
and children.

32:02.173 --> 32:03.347
Rental tuxedoes.

32:03.391 --> 32:05.565
The bouquet, the garter,
the cake, the-the...

32:05.608 --> 32:07.130
The fittings.
The fittings.

32:07.173 --> 32:08.608
The fittings.

32:08.652 --> 32:10.521
I am not even
to the actual ceremony yet.

32:12.217 --> 32:14.217
The vows.

32:14.260 --> 32:16.478
Hmm.

32:16.521 --> 32:18.521
The ring.

32:21.434 --> 32:23.434
The kiss.

32:24.478 --> 32:25.565
[laughs]

32:25.608 --> 32:27.260
The ketubah.

32:27.304 --> 32:30.478
I don't even know what I'd do
if I had to deal with all that.

32:30.521 --> 32:33.434
Elope?

32:35.521 --> 32:37.478
GIBBS:
Yeah, well,

32:37.521 --> 32:39.260
it worked for me.
Give me an update.

32:39.304 --> 32:41.565
We're just waiting for Dearing
to take the bait.

32:41.608 --> 32:43.086
McGEE:
Boss, an e-mail

32:43.130 --> 32:45.782
just came into the dummy
account we set up for Cole.

32:45.826 --> 32:47.695
Dearing?
I guess he
still wanted

32:47.739 --> 32:48.913
to recruit Cole.

32:48.956 --> 32:50.434
Address is encrypted,

32:50.478 --> 32:52.043
but the text sure
sounds like him.

32:52.086 --> 32:54.260
TONY:
"Where Golden Eagles rest.

32:54.304 --> 32:56.173
Tomorrow 0800."

32:56.217 --> 32:58.956
The Golden Eagles are
an Israeli Air Force squadron.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.608
Something tells me
this isn't about Israel, Ziva.

33:01.652 --> 33:03.695
It's a nickname for
retired Navy pilots.

33:03.739 --> 33:05.434
So where do they rest?

33:05.478 --> 33:08.217
Isn't there an old coffee shop
downtown where they hang out?

33:08.260 --> 33:10.521
Everybody's got their spot.

33:14.434 --> 33:16.913
[knocking]

33:24.782 --> 33:26.739
Hi.

33:26.782 --> 33:29.347
Jimmy, you're not supposed
to see me!

33:29.391 --> 33:30.782
Yeah, I know, I know.

33:30.826 --> 33:32.913
I'm-I'm sorry. I just...

33:32.956 --> 33:35.304
Uh, can I come in?

33:41.304 --> 33:43.782
Mmm. Good morning, Groom.

33:44.782 --> 33:46.130
Good morning.

33:46.173 --> 33:48.130
[laughs]

33:48.173 --> 33:51.739
Um... uh...

33:51.782 --> 33:55.043
You know... You know
how much I love you, right?

33:55.086 --> 33:56.739
Yeah.

33:56.782 --> 33:59.521
And you know I'd do anything
to make you happy.

34:01.391 --> 34:05.304
So, uh, Bree, sweetie, I...

34:05.347 --> 34:07.434
I need your help.

34:07.478 --> 34:10.347
Jimmy, what is it?

34:10.391 --> 34:13.521
I... I know that we've waited
for this day for so long,

34:13.565 --> 34:17.391
and I know how excited
your family is.

34:19.521 --> 34:24.086
But my family,
the people that I care about--

34:24.130 --> 34:26.826
well, they're not here,
they're at home.

34:26.869 --> 34:29.304
They're trying to protect us
so we can be safe,

34:29.347 --> 34:32.434
so we can have... all this.

34:35.478 --> 34:37.434
I should be with them.

34:39.652 --> 34:43.739
So, rather than wait
until this afternoon,

34:43.782 --> 34:46.521
let's just do this right now.

34:46.565 --> 34:49.347
And then,
after I go home and help,

34:49.391 --> 34:52.478
we can have a party
or a... a honeymoon.

34:52.521 --> 34:54.782
Anything you want.

34:56.782 --> 34:59.173
You want to get married now?

35:02.478 --> 35:07.130
Jimmy, I'm not marrying
you for all this.

35:07.173 --> 35:11.173
I am marrying you because
you're the sweetest,

35:11.217 --> 35:13.521
most kindhearted
man I have ever met.

35:17.043 --> 35:18.782
That's a yes, right?

35:18.826 --> 35:20.391
[laughing]
Yes.

35:20.434 --> 35:22.217
Mmm.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.478
Hey. Coffee?

35:50.521 --> 35:53.347
Please.

35:54.391 --> 35:56.652
You wouldn't be Cole
by any chance?

35:56.695 --> 35:58.869
Who's asking?

36:01.217 --> 36:04.347
Messenger dropped this off
when I got here.

36:04.391 --> 36:07.478
Told him I wouldn't be part
of any drug deal or anything.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.652
[ringing]

36:26.695 --> 36:28.695
[sighs]

36:28.739 --> 36:31.260
Dearing's onto us.

36:31.304 --> 36:33.304
[ringing continues]

36:35.304 --> 36:38.478
Not exactly the meet-and-greet
I was hoping for, Dearing.

36:38.521 --> 36:40.913
Yes, well, perhaps another time.

36:40.956 --> 36:43.043
I would like you
to relay a message

36:43.086 --> 36:44.782
to Agent Gibbs
if you'd be so kind.

36:44.826 --> 36:47.782
You're big on messengers.

36:47.826 --> 36:52.478
DEARING:
Tell him that I was never really
interested in Director Vance.

36:52.521 --> 36:55.739
So what are you interested in?

36:57.173 --> 36:58.782
Justice.

37:02.043 --> 37:04.347
DEARING:
I would like you
to relay a message

37:04.391 --> 37:06.347
to Agent Gibbs,
if you'd be so kind.

37:06.391 --> 37:10.043
Tell him that I was never really
interested in Director Vance.

37:10.086 --> 37:13.782
Man's got a funny way
of showing his lack of interest.

37:13.826 --> 37:16.347
Guy's got stones,
I'll give him that.

37:16.391 --> 37:18.173
Should you
still be here?

37:18.217 --> 37:19.956
McGEE:
Fires were set
on the ships

37:20.000 --> 37:21.043
and at Agent Larson's home.

37:21.086 --> 37:23.260
He took Director Vance...

37:23.304 --> 37:25.391
And destabilized
Dr. Ryan. Why?

37:25.434 --> 37:27.000
Because she's
a brain-gamer.

37:27.043 --> 37:29.782
He didn't want her
figuring out what was next.

37:29.826 --> 37:31.304
What is next?

37:36.478 --> 37:37.739
You going somewhere, Leon?

37:37.782 --> 37:38.913
Pentagon.

37:38.956 --> 37:41.434
Meeting with SECNAV.

37:43.478 --> 37:47.695
McGee, play back Dearing's call,
isolate the background.

37:48.739 --> 37:50.000
What are you looking for, boss?

37:52.217 --> 37:53.521
DEARING [over phone]:
I would like you to relay

37:53.565 --> 37:54.652
a message to Agent Gibbs...

37:54.695 --> 37:56.478
[church bells ringing
over phone]

37:56.521 --> 37:58.478
Bells of the
Navy Chapel.

37:58.521 --> 38:01.086
[Dearing's garbled voice,
marching drums beating]

38:01.130 --> 38:03.260
Drums are

38:03.304 --> 38:05.913
Commandant's Own, Leon,
over at Eighth and "I."

38:05.956 --> 38:07.956
He is nearby.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.173
What's he waiting for?

38:09.217 --> 38:11.260
Ziva, when we found
the director's car,

38:11.304 --> 38:12.739
what else we find?

38:12.782 --> 38:14.304
Nothing.
There were no prints.

38:14.347 --> 38:16.086
No signs of tampering.
Nothing was touched.

38:16.130 --> 38:18.260
You mean, we didn't
strip it down?

38:18.304 --> 38:20.565
There was no reason to.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.086
Director, he's not after
you; he's after your car.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.304
He placed something
inside it.

38:28.652 --> 38:29.739
Where is it parked?

38:29.782 --> 38:31.304
Just outside this building.

38:31.347 --> 38:33.000
Evacuate.
Get everybody out of here.

38:33.043 --> 38:34.347
Clear the building,
call the bomb squad.

38:34.391 --> 38:36.304
TONY: Everybody, we need
to evacuate the building.

38:36.347 --> 38:39.000
There's something there;
we need to shut it down.

38:39.043 --> 38:40.913
Gibbs, you know
I was bomb disposal.

38:40.956 --> 38:42.217
They're already on their way.

38:42.260 --> 38:44.173
Not fast enough.

38:50.043 --> 38:51.913
Yeah. Come on.

38:51.956 --> 38:53.956
[siren wailing]

38:58.304 --> 39:00.304
[sirens approaching]

39:15.652 --> 39:17.956
[sighs]
Where should we start?

39:21.130 --> 39:23.086
It's not here.

39:23.130 --> 39:25.173
Inside.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.652
McGee, get out! Now!

39:31.695 --> 39:34.086
Just one second, Director.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.043
Everybody out.

39:54.086 --> 39:56.086
Get away
from the building.

39:57.086 --> 39:58.304
Out.
All right.

39:58.347 --> 39:59.565
Come on.

39:59.608 --> 40:00.956
That's everybody.
You go, Ziva.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.391
No. I'm not going
without you.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.391
Hey, Cole.

40:26.391 --> 40:27.695
Stop.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.391
Get out of here.

40:54.086 --> 40:55.956
It's too close
to the building.

40:59.043 --> 41:02.391
Go. Get her out of here.

41:04.391 --> 41:07.956
It's not the danger...

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
it's the fun.

41:18.043 --> 41:21.043
[sighs]

41:26.086 --> 41:28.347
[phone ringing]

41:54.347 --> 41:56.130
[thunder rumbling]

41:59.695 --> 42:01.434
[phone ringing]

42:04.391 --> 42:06.043
Hello.

42:06.086 --> 42:09.000
Yes, this is Dr. Mallard.

42:10.434 --> 42:12.347
[indistinct voice
over phone]

42:12.391 --> 42:14.608
Dear God.

42:14.652 --> 42:16.608
How many?

42:16.652 --> 42:18.043
Yeah, of course.

42:18.086 --> 42:22.043
T-T-Tell him I'll be...
I'll be there right away.

42:22.086 --> 42:23.913
Yeah, it-it's imperative

42:23.956 --> 42:26.695
that no one touch any
of the deceased until I...

42:26.739 --> 42:28.869
un-until I re...
