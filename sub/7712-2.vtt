WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.270
HEY!

00:02.303 --> 00:04.338
HEY!
I GOT YOU ONE.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.239
OH, WOW, THANK YOU.
YEAH.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.607
I WAS GONNA GRAB SOME CHIPS.
YOU WANT SOME?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.042
NO, THANKS.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.044
UH, WE'RE STILL
HAVING LUNCH TODAY, RIGHT?

00:10.078 --> 00:13.514
I GUESS.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.017
HOW DARE YOU?

00:29.730 --> 00:31.532
(Michael)
HEY, TOBY?

00:31.565 --> 00:32.533
WHAT'S THIS?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.435
I JUST WANNA
REMIND EVERYONE

00:34.468 --> 00:37.471
ABOUT THE COMPANY RULES
INVOLVING PDA,

00:37.505 --> 00:39.740
OR PUBLIC DISPLAYS
OF AFFECTION.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.542
YES, SOME PEOPLE
IN THE OFFICE HAVE COMPLAINED.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.676
OH, REALLY.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.478
ABOUT SOME OTHER PEOPLE
ENGAGING IN PDA.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.713
AND, YOU KNOW,

00:45.746 --> 00:47.348
JUST WANTED
TO REMIND THEM

00:47.381 --> 00:48.449
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE
TO DO THAT.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.351
IS THIS ABOUT ME AND JAN
IN MY OFFICE?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.753
BECAUSE I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT THAT WAS CONSENSUAL.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.223
WHAT WE DID HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU

00:55.256 --> 00:56.324
OR ANYONE HERE.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.426
I DON'T THINK
ANYONE HEARD ANYTHING.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.294
WE WERE VERY DISCREET.

01:00.328 --> 01:03.397
AND--AND MOST PEOPLE HAD LEFT
BY THAT POINT.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.798
SO I DON'T THINK
IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.135
WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO,

01:07.168 --> 01:08.336
IS ROLL UP THE MEMO
REAL TIGHT...

01:08.369 --> 01:11.305
OKAY, LOOK, THE MEMO
WAS NOT ABOUT YOU.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.640
FOR THE RECORD,
I HAVE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED

01:12.673 --> 01:14.742
WITH ANYONE AT WORK
IN ANY CAPACITY.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.678
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, LOOK.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.680
ALL RIGHT, THE COMPLAINT
WAS ABOUT JIM AND PAM.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.483
SO...

01:22.516 --> 01:23.617
NO WAY.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.186
WHAT?

01:25.219 --> 01:26.420
YOU GUYS ARE TOGETHER?

01:26.454 --> 01:29.823
UM...

01:29.857 --> 01:31.792
YEP.

01:31.825 --> 01:32.893
YES, WE ARE.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.228
WHOA!
WOW!

01:34.262 --> 01:35.696
TUNA!

01:35.729 --> 01:37.365
I KNEW IT!
AWESOME!

01:37.398 --> 01:39.200
TO THE TWO OF YOU.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.368
(Michael)
YES!
YES!

01:40.401 --> 01:41.735
TOBY, WAS THIS
YOUR FUN LITTLE WAY

01:41.769 --> 01:43.704
OF CONGRATULATING US?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.273
YES.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.840
(Michael)
OKAY.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.442
MIND IS EXPLODING.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.444
GET OVER HERE.
COME ON.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.780
COME HERE.

01:52.813 --> 01:56.217
OKAY.
OKAY, STAND UP.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.487
HERE WE GO.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.157
EVERYONE, THIS IS A DAY
THAT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.892
BECAUSE TODAY...

02:04.925 --> 02:07.261
IS THE DAY...

02:07.295 --> 02:10.498
THAT JIM AND PAM
BECOME ONE.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.633
ACTUALLY, WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.835
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.309
PHONE'S RINGING.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.477
NO, NO, NO.
PAM, LET 'EM RING.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.480
LET THE BELLS
OF DUNDER MIFFLIN

02:26.514 --> 02:27.715
CHIME OUT YOUR LOVE.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.450
BECAUSE...

02:29.483 --> 02:31.452
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.287
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.590
MY HEART SOARS...

02:36.624 --> 02:38.426
WITH THE EAGLE'S NEST.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.627
I DON'T SEE IT.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.762
I THINK THEY BOTH
COULD DO BETTER.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.464
IT'S NOT
A SURPRISE TO ME.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.567
PAM IS THE OFFICE MATTRESS.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.968
JIM HALPERT'S
OFF THE MARKET.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.338
GUESS WHO JUST BECAME
THE BEST LOOKING SINGLE GUY

02:50.371 --> 02:51.905
IN THE OFFICE?

02:51.939 --> 02:54.908
[cheerful music]

02:54.942 --> 03:02.950
*

03:24.305 --> 03:28.576
HEY, CAN YOU
MAKE THAT STRAIGHTER?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.511
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.280
DID YOU PLAN THAT?

03:32.313 --> 03:34.848
NO.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.584
CAN YOU MAKE THAT STRAIGHTER?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.952
THAT JOB LOOKS HARD.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.289
YOU SHOULD
PUT YOUR MOUTH ON THAT.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.956
HOW CAN YOU EVEN
USE THAT ONE NATURALLY?

03:42.990 --> 03:44.992
BLOWING UP BALLOONS,
I THOUGHT.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.294
(Pam)
YOU MIGHT
WANNA TRIM IT A LITTLE?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.761
(Phyllis)
MICHAEL.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.797
OH, IS RYAN
COMING BACK TODAY?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.433
YEAH, HE IS.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.303
OH.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.504
PAM AND JIM ARE TOGETHER.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.372
RYAN IS VISITING.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.874
ONLY THING THAT COULD
MAKE THIS DAY BETTER

04:00.908 --> 04:02.576
IS ICE CREAM.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.447
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:06.480 --> 04:09.417
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.385
WHAT IS THAT?

04:11.419 --> 04:12.720
IT'S A FERAL BARN CAT.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.388
I TRAPPED HIM LAST NIGHT
AND I'M GIVING HIM TO YOU

04:14.422 --> 04:16.557
AS A REPLACEMENT CAT
FOR THE ONE I DESTROYED.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.726
HER NAME WAS SPRINKLES.

04:18.759 --> 04:22.696
AND HIS NAME IS GARBAGE.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.932
MOSE CALLS HIM GARBAGE
'CAUSE HE LIKES TO EAT GARBAGE.

04:24.965 --> 04:25.933
DON'T YOU, GARBAGE?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.501
AR AR AR AR!

04:27.535 --> 04:28.502
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST THOUGHT

04:28.536 --> 04:30.604
YOU COULD REPLACE SPRINKLES.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.705
BEFORE SHE'S EVEN
IN THE GROUND.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.574
YOU HAVEN'T
BURIED HER YET?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.909
DON'T RUSH ME.
I'M GRIEVING.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.579
GARBAGE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL,
OKAY?

04:38.612 --> 04:39.447
HE'S A USEFUL CAT.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.549
HE KILLED AN ENTIRE FAMILY
OF RACCOONS.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.550
LOOK AT HIM.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.051
I DON'T WANT GARBAGE.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.619
I WANT SPRINKLES.

04:54.362 --> 04:57.465
[cat yelps]

04:58.766 --> 05:01.402
HEY, TOBY.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.803
HEY, PAM...

05:02.836 --> 05:03.804
YOU TWO.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.938
HEY.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.375
SO NOW THAT WE ARE DATING,

05:07.408 --> 05:08.509
UH, WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IF WE HAD TO SIGN

05:08.542 --> 05:11.545
ONE OF THOSE "WE'RE DATING"
THINGS FOR THE COMPANY.

05:11.579 --> 05:15.616
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THOSE ARE ONLY FOR,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.818
YOU KNOW, RELATIONSHIPS.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.987
SO IF IT'S JUST
A CASUAL THING,

05:20.020 --> 05:21.822
THERE'S NO NEED, REALLY.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.023
OH.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.658
WELL, I DON'T WANNA
SPEAK FOR JIM,

05:24.692 --> 05:28.028
BUT IT'S, LIKE,
PRETTY OFFICIAL.

05:28.061 --> 05:32.400
UH-HUH.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.036
SORRY, SO DO WE NEED TO...
SIGN ONE, OR...

05:36.069 --> 05:38.672
LET'S JUST WAIT AND SEE
WHAT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.773
WHAT?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.643
WELL, LET'S JUST WAIT.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.711
OH, OKAY.
OKAY.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.745
GREAT.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.813
YEAH.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.588
HEY, RYAN.
HOLD ON ONE SEC.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.123
WELCOME BA...

06:03.797 --> 06:05.399
HEY, PAM.
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.700
IS MICHAEL IN?

06:06.734 --> 06:07.635
(Michael)
HEY, THERE HE IS!
YEAH.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.902
THERE HE IS!

06:08.936 --> 06:11.505
HE'S BACK!
AND HE'S WITH A BEARD.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.973
[laughing]
HE HAS FACIAL HAIR.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.075
LOOK AT HIM!

06:15.108 --> 06:17.411
ALL GROWN UP
AND NO PLACE TO GO.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.681
HELLO, MR. SONNY CROCKET.
I'M TUBBS.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.983
OKAY.
SHOULD WE GET STARTED?

06:23.016 --> 06:25.152
OH, YEAH, LET'S GET STARTED
BECAUSE, UH, YES.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.687
'CAUSE THIS IS
VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.788
YEAH, EXACTLY.

06:27.821 --> 06:28.822
THIS IS A BUSINESS MEETING.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.823
FIRE GUY!

06:29.857 --> 06:30.824
AH!
STOP THAT!

06:30.858 --> 06:31.825
THAT'S RIGHT!

06:31.859 --> 06:33.694
THAT'S RIGHT!

06:33.727 --> 06:35.128
FIRE GUY--DON'T START
ANY FIRES, RYAN.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.597
FIRE GUY!
[whooshing]

06:36.630 --> 06:37.598
YOU WEREN'T HERE FOR THAT.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.899
HERE FOR WHAT?

06:38.932 --> 06:40.768
WHEN HE STARTED THE FIRE.
LOOK HOW BIG HE IS.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.102
LOOK AT YOU.

06:42.135 --> 06:46.173
YOU ARE SO MATURE AND OLD
AND LITTLE MAN NOW.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.174
YOU'RE LIKE
OUR LITTLE MAN.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.709
OKAY.
LITTLE OLD MAN BOY.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.910
MICHAEL, EVERYBODY...

06:49.943 --> 06:51.612
(Kevin)
BEARDED MAN BOY.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.680
(Michael)
LET ME SAY SOMETHING.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.981
I KNOW
I USED TO BE A TEMP HERE,

06:54.014 --> 06:55.716
BUT NOW EVERYTHING
IS DIFFERENT.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.684
YEAH.
I'D LIKE YOUR RESPECT.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.085
I AM YOUR BOSS NOW.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.620
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TREAT ME

06:59.653 --> 07:00.621
THE SAME WAY
YOU TREATED JAN.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.722
OH, WOW.
SO...

07:01.755 --> 07:03.591
NNNN.
THAT'S A LITTLE KINKY.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.725
I DON'T SWING THAT WAY.
OKAY.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.026
HOO!
[laughing]

07:06.059 --> 07:07.561
I THINK RYAN
HAS A GAY CRUSH ON ME.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.497
ENOUGH, OKAY!
THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.798
AND IT STOPS RIGHT NOW.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.536
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.671
YES.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.507
EVERYBODY, COME ON.
SETTLE DOWN.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.574
LET'S GET SERIOUS HERE.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.876
UM, RYAN HAS A VERY SPECIAL

07:22.910 --> 07:25.145
IMPORTANT PRESENTATION
TO DO.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.213
WHICH WE WILL BE DOING
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM

07:26.246 --> 07:27.581
IN TEN MINUTES.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.916
PERFECT.
SOUND GOOD?

07:28.949 --> 07:30.150
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.552
YEAH, RYAN SNAPPED AT ME.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.021
BUT THERE WAS
THIS TWINKLE IN HIS EYE

07:34.054 --> 07:36.056
THAT I PICKED UP ON
WHICH SAID,

07:36.089 --> 07:38.191
"DUDE, WE'RE FRIENDS.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.027
"I'M DOING THIS
FOR APPEARANCES.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.496
"I AM THE BIG BOSS NOW.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.797
"AND I HAVE TO SEEM
LIKE AN OGRE.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.534
"BUT YOU KNOW ME
AND YOU TRUST ME.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.235
"AND WE LIKE EACH OTHER.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.203
"AND WE'LL ALWAYS
BE FRIENDS.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.040
"AND I WOULD
NEVER TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED

07:53.073 --> 07:56.276
"IN A MILLION YEARS.

07:56.309 --> 08:00.548
AND I MISS YOU, MAN.
AND I LOVE YOU."

08:00.581 --> 08:02.583
HIS WORDS.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.821
DUNDER MIFFLIN INFINITY

08:07.855 --> 08:10.123
REPRESENTS A FLOOR
TO CEILING STREAMLINING

08:10.157 --> 08:11.792
OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.126
THE CENTERPIECE
OF THE CAMPAIGN

08:13.160 --> 08:15.996
IS A NEW BUSINESS TO BUSINESS
WEBSITE INTERFACE

08:16.029 --> 08:17.665
THAT WILL ALLOW US

08:17.698 --> 08:19.867
TO COMPETE DIRECTLY
WITH BIG BOX CHAINS.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.101
WAIT A SECOND.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.202
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

08:22.235 --> 08:24.037
DUNDER MIFFLIN
ALREADY HAS A WEBSITE.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.005
AND QUITE FRANKLY,

08:25.038 --> 08:28.041
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.677
THIS IS A MASSIVE OVERHAUL.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.244
WE'RE GETTING YOUNGER.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.646
SLEEKER.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.214
AND MORE AGILE
WITH THE WAY

08:34.247 --> 08:35.883
THAT WE ADAPT
TO THE MARKETPLACE.

08:35.916 --> 08:36.950
ALL ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL
WILL BE ISSUED BLACKBERRIES

08:36.984 --> 08:38.218
FOR COMPANY USE.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.720
OH!
GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.

08:39.753 --> 08:40.854
I'LL STICK AROUND
FOR A WHILE

08:40.888 --> 08:41.855
TO HELP YOU
SET THEM UP AFTERWARDS.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.056
ANY QUESTIONS?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.692
DWIGHT.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.659
WHAT IF WE DON'T

08:45.693 --> 08:47.227
WANNA USE A BLACKBERRY
BECAUSE THEY ARE STUPID

08:47.260 --> 08:48.562
AND POINTLESS?

08:48.596 --> 08:49.863
THIS IS COMPANY-WIDE,
DWIGHT.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.164
GOT IT.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.099
(Ryan)
ANDY.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.268
YOU SHOULD CALL IT
DUNDER-MIFFLINFINITY.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.104
YOU KNOW,
PUSH THE WORDS TOGETHER.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.305
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.274
KELLY KAPOOR.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.176
CAN WE SPEAK PRIVATELY
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.646
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY!

09:05.679 --> 09:07.014
RYAN HOWARD EVERYBODY!

09:07.047 --> 09:08.115
GOOD JOB!

09:08.148 --> 09:09.783
[scattered applause]

09:09.817 --> 09:11.619
THAT WAS SOME FUN STUFF.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.753
WHEN'S THE WEBSITE GO UP?

09:12.786 --> 09:13.621
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.623
WE WANT TO START
RE-TRAINING PEOPLE ASAP,

09:15.656 --> 09:17.257
SO WE CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING
WITH THE NEW SYSTEM.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.760
COOL BEANS.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.094
WE'RE SCREWED.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.095
WHO IS?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.163
US, YOU AND ME.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.164
THE OLD TIMERS.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.600
I AM NOT OLD.
YOU ARE OLD.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.235
YOU ARE, LIKE, 100.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.337
YOU'RE OVER 40.
THAT'S THE CUT-OFF.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.872
ARE YOU LISTENING
TO WHAT HE'S SAYING?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.373
RE-TRAINING.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.208
NEW SYSTEM.
YOUTH.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.678
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS KID
IS THE GRIM REAPER.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.913
YOU DEAL WITH THIS,

09:39.947 --> 09:41.014
OR YOU, ME, SAMMY,
PHYLLIS,

09:41.048 --> 09:42.082
THE CHICK YOU HIT
WITH A CAR,

09:42.115 --> 09:45.318
WE'RE GONERS.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.155
I SWORE I WOULDN'T
TELL ANYBODY THIS, BUT...

09:48.188 --> 09:51.158
IN THE INTEREST OF...

09:51.191 --> 09:53.326
REVEALING SECRETS...

09:53.360 --> 09:55.362
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS GONNA
MAKE YOUR BRAIN EXPLODE.

09:55.395 --> 10:00.067
UM, DWIGHT AND ANGELA...
DATING.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.003
HAVE BEEN
FOR SIX MONTHS.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.838
NO.
SWEAR TO GOD.

10:04.872 --> 10:05.739
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.207
I WAS ACTUALLY
GONNA WAIT AND TELL YOU

10:07.240 --> 10:09.342
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY,
BUT THIS IS MUCH MORE FUN.

10:09.376 --> 10:13.013
NO, THEY HAVE BEEN DATING
FOR, LIKE, TWO YEARS.

10:13.046 --> 10:17.250
SINCE BEFORE YOUR BARBEQUE.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.286
WAIT, WHAT?

10:20.721 --> 10:21.722
YOU KNEW.

10:21.755 --> 10:22.923
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.358
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ME.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.260
FAIR ENOUGH.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.862
WOW!

10:28.896 --> 10:32.099
WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED DATING,
LIKE, A LONG TIME AGO.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.266
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.902
SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GUYS WERE IN HERE.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.169
NO, NO,
WE'RE JUST SITTING HERE.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.370
I COULDN'T SEE YOUR HANDS.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.073
OH, HEY, PAM,
BY THE WAY,

10:40.107 --> 10:41.775
IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU'RE DATING.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.343
BUT WHEN A NEW CLIENT CALLS,

10:43.376 --> 10:46.446
YOU JUST HAVE
TO RANDOMLY ASSIGN THEM

10:46.479 --> 10:48.048
TO A SALESPERSON.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.349
YOU CAN'T BASE
WHO GETS NEW CLIENTS

10:49.382 --> 10:51.251
ON WHO YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH
THAT WEEK.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.352
OKAY?

10:52.385 --> 10:54.454
OKAY.
OKAY.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.789
OKAY.

10:55.823 --> 10:59.059
AND...THAT IS WHY
WE WAITED SO LONG

10:59.092 --> 11:00.160
TO TELL PEOPLE.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.739
OKAY, WHAT'S UP?

11:11.772 --> 11:12.773
YEAH, OKAY.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.074
UM, I WAS JUST...

11:14.107 --> 11:16.343
AFTER THE PRESENTATION,
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

11:16.376 --> 11:18.078
THAT VIS-A-VIS
ME IN THE OFFICE,

11:18.111 --> 11:19.412
EVERYTHING IS BUSINESS
AS USUAL.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.015
WELL, IT IS BUSINESS,
BUT NOT AS USUAL.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.951
YEAH, NO, I UNDERSTAND.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.954
WE'RE MAKING GREAT STRIDES
AND WE'RE UPDATING.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.421
BUT BUSINESS AS USUAL, NO?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.057
NO.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.158
WE'RE THROWING OUT
THE ENTIRE PLAYBOOK.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.359
WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.294
WE'RE IMPLEMENTING
A BRAND NEW SYSTEM.

11:34.327 --> 11:37.030
GOOD,
SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.099
NO.
WE'RE NOT.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.400
MM.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.468
MICHAEL, I KNOW...

11:41.501 --> 11:45.072
EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME
AND MANPOWER

11:45.105 --> 11:46.940
ARE WASTED
IN THIS BRANCH.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.308
THIS COMPANY
IS GETTING YOUNGER,

11:48.341 --> 11:50.844
FASTER, MORE EFFICIENT.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.480
YOU NEED
TO PREPARE YOURSELF.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.915
WE HAD A FOREIGN
EXCHANGE STUDENT

11:54.948 --> 11:56.416
LIVE WITH US
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.452
AND WE CALLED HIM
MY BROTHER.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.289
AND THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT HE WAS.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.158
UM, AND THEN HE WENT HOME
TO WHAT IS NOW

12:05.192 --> 12:07.828
FORMERLY YUGOSLAVIA.

12:07.861 --> 12:11.064
TAKING ALL OF MY BLUE JEANS
WITH HIM.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.367
AND I HAD TO SPEND
THE ENTIRE WINTER IN SHORTS.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.404
THAT IS WHAT RYAN IS LIKE.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.974
A FAKE BROTHER
WHO STEALS YOUR JEANS.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.314
SO...
HOW ARE YOU?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.315
AWESOME.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.416
I AM DATING A LOT OF GUYS.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.884
GOOD.
A LOT.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.019
BLACK GUYS, MOSTLY.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.253
KELLY.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.489
WHAT?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.959
(Phyllis)
WAIT, UH...

12:38.992 --> 12:39.960
HOW DO YOU TOUCH
JUST ONE OF THESE BUTTONS

12:39.993 --> 12:41.328
AT A TIME?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.963
I DON'T KNOW.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.464
DID YOU EVEN TRY?

12:45.565 --> 12:48.101
IF THE KID WANTS
TO SET MINE UP, I'LL LET HIM.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.437
I CAN'T SEE
HALF THE THINGS.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.506
IT'S TOO LITTLE.
USE THE PHONE.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.308
(Kelly)
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.376
THAT IS WHAT I WANT.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.578
(Ryan)
KELLY, I'M YOUR BOSS NOW,
OKAY?

12:58.611 --> 13:01.081
YOU CAN'T KEEP TALKING TO ME
LIKE I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.351
OH, BIG STRONG MAN.
FANCY NEW WHATEVER.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.418
I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER CARED ABOUT ME.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.820
I NEVER CARED ABOUT YOU?

13:06.854 --> 13:07.955
SIX MONTHS AGO,
KAREN FILIPPELLI

13:07.988 --> 13:09.489
SENT ME AN EMAIL
ASKING ME OUT.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.524
I SAID NO BECAUSE I WAS
COMMITTED TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.293
WELL, I HOPE
YOU'RE STILL COMMITTED,

13:13.326 --> 13:14.494
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.467
AND GUESS WHAT, BUDDY?
I AM KEEPING IT.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.369
OKAY.
OKAY.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.536
DO YOU FEEL PREPARED
TO HELP ME RAISE A BABY?

13:23.570 --> 13:25.338
I CA...

13:25.372 --> 13:26.206
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

13:26.239 --> 13:29.042
AFTER WORK,
WE'LL GO OUT TO DINNER.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.512
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT THEN,
OKAY?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.483
WE HAVE A DATE!

13:40.220 --> 13:41.188
HELLO.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.489
HELLO, DWIGHT.

13:42.522 --> 13:46.093
I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THINGS.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.029
AND I WANTED TO KNOW
IF YOU WOULD

13:49.062 --> 13:50.630
HAVE DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.265
REALLY?

13:52.299 --> 13:53.500
YES.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.501
I'LL MAKE A RESERVATION.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.904
NO, NO,
LET ME COOK FOR YOU.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.973
CAULIFLOWER AND NOODLES.
BAKED POTATO ON THE SIDE.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.210
I WOULD PREFER
A PUBLIC PLACE.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.578
SEE YOU AFTER WORK.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.584
HI, PAM.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.320
HI.
IS MICHAEL IN?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.888
IN HIS OFFICE.
YOU CAN GO RIGHT IN.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.323
OKAY.
HEY.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.524
JAN.
RYAN.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.993
RYAN RYAN RYAN.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.463
SO, ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM,
I HAVE YOUR OLD JOB.

14:23.496 --> 14:27.334
WELL, NOT EXACTLY...
MY JOB.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.069
I HAD A DIFFERENT TITLE.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.170
OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.471
SAME OFFICE.
SAME RESPONSIBILITIES.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.573
DIFFERENT SALARY.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.607
BUT YOU'LL GET THERE.
DON'T WORRY.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.277
WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.278
THANK YOU.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.279
THANK YOU.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.214
SCRANTON SUITS YOU.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.549
BEST DECISION I EVER MADE.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.952
YOU WERE LET GO.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.586
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOVE THE BEARD.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.221
KEEP IT FOREVER.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.556
(Michael)
HEY.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.624
(Jan)
HEY.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.326
WHAT IS THE ACTUAL DEAL

14:53.360 --> 14:55.495
WITH THESE THINGS
IN TERMS OF TESTICLES?

14:55.528 --> 14:57.497
WHAT?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.966
I DON'T WANNA
GROW WEIRD SPERM

14:58.999 --> 15:00.633
IN CASE WE EVER
WANNA HAVE KIDS.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.938
SO WHAT'S RYAN DOING HERE?

15:04.972 --> 15:05.973
OH.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.174
I DON'T KNOW.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.942
THEY'RE LAUNCHING
A BIG NEW BUSINESS PLAN.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.545
AND NEW WEBSITE.
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.381
HE'S BEING
A REAL TWERP ABOUT IT TOO.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.616
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOUTH,

15:16.649 --> 15:19.586
AND AGILITY,
AND STREAMLINING.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.621
TRYING TO SQUEEZE OUT
THE OLDER PEOPLE.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.689
HE'S SUCH A SNAKE.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.157
YEAH.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.625
I HOPE HE GETS HIT
WITH AN AGEISM SUIT.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.029
WHAT IS THAT WORD?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.998
AGEISM?

15:31.031 --> 15:32.199
YOU KNOW, COMPANIES,
THEY CAN'T DISCRIMINATE

15:32.232 --> 15:34.968
AGAINST PEOPLE
DUE TO OLD AGE.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.703
LIKE, A COUPLE YEARS AGO
WE TRIED TO FORCE OUT

15:36.736 --> 15:38.138
SOME OF THE OLDER
BRANCH MANAGERS

15:38.171 --> 15:39.272
WITH A MANDATORY
RETIREMENT AGE.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.108
AND THEN ED TRUCK,
YOUR OLD BOSS,

15:41.141 --> 15:42.642
THREATENED US
WITH A LAWSUIT.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.511
SO WE HAD TO BACK OFF.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.678
SO OLDER PEOPLE
HAVE JUST AS MANY RIGHTS

15:45.712 --> 15:46.713
AS YOUNGER PEOPLE.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.448
YES, MICHAEL.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.608
CREED?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.643
YES, SIR?

16:16.676 --> 16:17.644
EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.246
EVERYTHING'S COOL, DUDE.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.014
I'M 30.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.649
WELL, IN NOVEMBER
I'LL BE 30.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.054
IS THERE
ANOTHER MEETING SCHEDULED?

16:27.087 --> 16:29.122
I WAS GONNA DO
THE BLACKBERRY TUTORIAL IN HERE.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.357
MICHAEL TOLD US
TO WAIT IN HERE.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.392
WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.729
OH, MAN.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.765
GOOD, WE'RE ALL HERE.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.033
WE CAN GET STARTED.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.334
MICHAEL.
HAVE A SEAT.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.335
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS TODAY.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.071
HAVE A SEAT
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.540
OKAY, THIS IS FOR EVERYONE'S...
STILL MY OFFICE, RYAN.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.716
WELL, THERE HAS BEEN
A LOT OF TALK

16:56.749 --> 16:58.551
ABOUT NEW IDEAS TODAY.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.754
WELL, NEW IDEAS ARE FINE.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.057
BUT THEY ARE ALSO ILLEGAL.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.059
BECAUSE THEY ARE A FORM...

17:06.093 --> 17:07.294
OF AGEISM.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.596
WHAT?
YES, I AM RIGHT.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.364
DID YOU KNOW...

17:11.398 --> 17:15.802
THAT THE AGE DISCRIMINATION
AND EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967

17:15.835 --> 17:17.570
PROHIBITS
EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION

17:17.604 --> 17:19.606
BASED ON AGE
WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEES

17:19.639 --> 17:22.309
40 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.310
I DID.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.078
MM?
TECHNICALLY HE'S RIGHT.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.613
HEY, SHUT UP, TOBY.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.315
LOOK, WHY DO WE

17:28.348 --> 17:31.118
AS A SOCIETY
HATE OLD PEOPLE SO MUCH?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.119
BECAUSE THEY'RE LAME.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.220
NO!

17:33.253 --> 17:35.288
CREED, NO, THEY ARE NOT.

17:35.322 --> 17:39.626
IN FACT, MANY CULTURES
REVERE OLD PEOPLE

17:39.659 --> 17:42.562
BECAUSE OF THEIR
STORYTELLING ABILITY.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.730
LIKE THE OLD LADY
FROM TITANIC.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.466
OR THE FUNNY THINGS
THAT THEY CAN DO,

17:46.499 --> 17:48.635
LIKE, "WHERE'S THE BEEF?"

17:48.668 --> 17:49.769
YEAH.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.404
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THE BIG PICTURE UP AGAIN?

17:51.438 --> 17:52.672
YOU USED THAT ALREADY

17:52.705 --> 17:53.673
WHEN YOU BURNED YOUR FOOT.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.175
REUSING THE BEN KINGSLEY TOO.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.678
I WAS GOING TO PUT UP
SOME NEW PICTURES,

17:58.711 --> 18:00.347
BUT, UM, ALL OF THE INK
IN THE PRINTER WAS GONE.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.849
(Pam)
OH.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.417
MICHAEL SCOTT?
THAT IS ME!

18:04.451 --> 18:05.818
COME ON IN.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.321
WHO IS THIS OLD FART?

18:08.355 --> 18:09.356
DID YOU JUST
STAGGER OFF THE STREET

18:09.389 --> 18:12.525
OUT OF A BOX OR SOMETHING?

18:12.559 --> 18:14.661
WHO'S THIS WORTHLESS
BAG OF BONES?

18:14.694 --> 18:17.764
WELL, THIS GUY IS NONE OTHER
THAN ONE OF THE FOUNDERS

18:17.797 --> 18:20.300
OF DUNDER MIFFLIN,
MR. ROBERT DUNDER.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.302
HUH?

18:22.335 --> 18:24.537
OH, YEAH!

18:24.571 --> 18:25.538
YES!

18:25.572 --> 18:26.773
HI, EVERYONE.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.275
MICHAEL, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.210
SURE THING.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.146
EXCUSE ME.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.381
WE HAVE
ACTUAL WORK TO DO.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.848
FINE.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.917
THEN I WILL CALL DAVID WALLACE
AND YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO HIM

18:37.950 --> 18:39.786
WHY YOU THREW
THE FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY

18:39.819 --> 18:42.755
OUT ON HIS ANCIENT BUTT.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.794
BOB, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.196
I'M 87.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.798
87 YEARS YOUNG.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.401
AND STILL ACTIVE.
THAT IS GREAT.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.369
DID YOU KNOW THAT BOB
IS STILL A MEMBER

18:56.403 --> 18:58.471
OF THE BOARD
OF DUNDER MIFFLIN?

18:58.505 --> 19:01.241
WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO A BOARD MEETING IN YEARS.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.476
I SEND A PROXY.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.844
AH, STILL SENDS
HIS OWN PROXY.

19:04.877 --> 19:05.778
GOOD FOR YOU.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.681
I'M GOING TO LIVE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.651
MY GRANDMA SCHRUTE
LIVED TO BE 101.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.487
MY GRANDPA MANNHEIM IS 103.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.723
AND STILL PUTTERING AROUND
DOWN IN ARGENTINA.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.758
I TRIED
TO GO VISIT HIM ONCE,

19:18.791 --> 19:20.960
BUT MY TRAVEL VISA
WAS PROTESTED

19:20.993 --> 19:22.195
BY THE SHOAH FOUNDATION.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.398
I STARTED THIS COMPANY
IN 1949.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.433
WOW.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.236
BACK THEN IT WAS

19:29.269 --> 19:31.671
AN INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIER
OF METAL BRACKETS, MOSTLY.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.440
FOR CONSTRUCTION.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.507
OH, BOY.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.875
AND THEN MIFFLIN...

19:35.908 --> 19:37.810
OF COURSE,
HE KILLED HIMSELF LATER.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.947
BUT I KNEW MIFFLIN
THROUGH THE ROTARY CLUB.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.948
GREAT.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.884
HE WAS...
[laughs]

19:44.917 --> 19:47.654
HE WAS AT DINNER
WITH BEVERLY AND HER HUSBAND.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.323
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
UM...

19:50.357 --> 19:51.491
UH, JERRY.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.892
JERRY TRUPIANO...

19:52.925 --> 19:54.361
FROM--FROM SOUTH JERSEY.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.364
AND HE WAS TALL.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.999
BOTH HE AND MIFFLIN
WERE TALL GUYS.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.568
GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.470
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.704
ROBERT DUNDER, EVERYBODY.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.239
THANK YOU.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.374
THAT WAS WONDERFUL.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.908
DO YOU HAVE A RIDE?

20:08.941 --> 20:09.909
WELL, I CAME HERE
IN A CAB.

20:09.942 --> 20:10.910
PERFECT.

20:10.943 --> 20:11.911
WELL, COULD YOU
GET ME ANOTHER...

20:11.944 --> 20:13.380
EXCELLENT.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.515
INSPIRATIONAL.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.750
WELL, WE HAVE LEARNED

20:17.784 --> 20:20.520
THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.521
BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.456
AND YOU WILL GO TO JAIL.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.758
I THINK THAT I SHOULD
HELP HIM GET HOME.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.427
NO, NO, DON'T HELP HIM!

20:27.460 --> 20:28.561
HE DOESN'T
NEED HELP, PAM.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.271
WHAT A NICE GUY.

20:39.606 --> 20:43.343
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.044
WELL, TODAY WAS
A FANTASTIC WASTE OF TIME.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.479
I DISAGREE.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.814
I THINK IT WAS VERY VALUABLE.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.882
MICHAEL, TECHNOLOGY
HELPS BUSINESS, OKAY?

20:49.916 --> 20:50.950
YOU SHOULD NOT RESIST IT.

20:50.983 --> 20:51.951
THIS IS THE WAY
THE WORLD IS MOVING.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.019
WELL, I HAPPEN TO THINK

20:53.052 --> 20:55.422
THAT THE OLD WAYS
OF DOING BUSINESS ARE BETTER.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.624
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.559
OKAY, I LOOK FORWARD
TO HEARING YOUR IDEAS.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.362
WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?

21:02.395 --> 21:03.029
I DON'T KNOW,
SOME PLACE ROMANTIC

21:03.062 --> 21:04.063
AND EXPENSIVE.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.465
KELLY, COME ON.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.066
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.035
I'M FEELING
KIND OF NAUSEOUS, ANYWAY.

21:09.068 --> 21:16.343
SO WE CAN JUST SKIP IT.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.312
(Dwight)
ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR VEGETARIAN NOODLES?

21:19.346 --> 21:21.414
VERY MUCH.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.515
HOW IS YOUR MEAT?

21:22.549 --> 21:25.552
DRY.
DELICIOUS.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.890
I HEARD A JOKE TODAY.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.360
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.929
YES, IT WAS.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.934
ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR MINERAL WATER?

21:41.968 --> 21:42.969
I CAN'T DO THIS.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.070
WHAT?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.872
I CAN'T BE WITH YOU.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.540
EVERY TIME
I LOOK IN YOUR EYES,

21:47.574 --> 21:50.042
I SEE SPRINKLES' STIFF,
LIFELESS BODY.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.745
THEN DON'T LOOK IN MY EYES.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.014
LOOK RIGHT HERE.
IT'S AN OLD SALES TRICK.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.048
I'M SORRY.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.418
I GAVE THIS
EVERYTHING I COULD.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.953
NO, PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS, MONKEY.

22:00.987 --> 22:01.788
I WILL LEAVE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH

22:01.821 --> 22:03.990
ON TOP OF YOUR TIRE
TOMORROW MORNING.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.999
SMELL THAT.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.033
SMELL THAT?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.635
DRY ROT.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.469
NO, DWIGHT.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.738
THAT SMELLS LIKE
GOOD BUSINESS TO ME.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.972
WHAT I HAVE DONE HERE,

22:20.006 --> 22:21.674
IS I HAVE COLLECTED
ALL THE FINEST

22:21.708 --> 22:23.910
GOURMET ITEMS
THAT SCRANTON HAS TO OFFER.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.678
HMM-MM, SWEET.
CHOCOLATE TURTLES.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.713
YES.
NOPE!

22:26.746 --> 22:29.416
NO, THOSE ARE
FOR OUR CLIENTS.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.083
ACTUALLY, OUR EX-CLIENTS.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.986
RYAN WANTS EVERYTHING
IN OUR COMPANY

22:34.020 --> 22:36.923
TO BE ABOUT EMAILS
AND I.M.'S.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.892
BUT I THINK HE IS FORGETTING

22:39.926 --> 22:43.095
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL
INSTANT MESSAGE.

22:43.129 --> 22:48.701
LETTERS ATTACHED
TO BASKETS OF FOOD.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.474
EXCUSE ME, ANGELA.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.075
MICHAEL ASKED ME
TO TURN IN THESE RECEIPTS

22:56.108 --> 22:58.010
FOR THESE
GIFT BASKET ITEMS.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.579
THANK YOU.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.582
YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.950
IS THAT ALL?

23:03.983 --> 23:07.487
YES.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.456
[whispering]
I MISS YOU.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.458
ELEVATORS.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.793
DWIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.162
WE ARE NOT
SEEING EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.531
CAN YOU ACCEPT THAT?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.668
FINE.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.070
THEN I JUST WANNA BE FRIENDS.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.071
GOOD.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.973
PLUS A LITTLE EXTRA.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.176
ALSO, I LOVE YOU.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.045
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.046
YOU DON'T.
NO!

23:34.080 --> 23:35.081
YOU LIED
ABOUT BEING PREGNANT.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.082
RIGHT, SO?

23:36.115 --> 23:36.883
YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

23:36.916 --> 23:38.184
WHY THAT MIGHT
MAKE ME KIND OF ANGRY?

23:38.217 --> 23:39.185
NO.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.520
WE'RE NEVER
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.088
WHY NOT?

23:44.223 --> 23:45.191
HI.

23:45.224 --> 23:49.028
HEY.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.463
ALL RIGHT,
I JUST HAVE TO ASK.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.199
NOW THAT WE'RE PUBLIC,

23:53.232 --> 23:55.768
UM, IS THE MAGIC GONE?

23:55.802 --> 23:58.204
IT'S FUNNY
YOU BRING THAT UP,

23:58.237 --> 24:00.139
BECAUSE YES, IT IS.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.742
[whispering]
I KNEW IT.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.544
OH, MAN.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.145
JUST LIKE THAT, HUH?

24:06.178 --> 24:07.614
I THINK...

24:07.647 --> 24:10.216
I MEAN, I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS, BUT...

24:10.249 --> 24:11.250
BE HONEST.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.786
I NOW FIND YOU REPULSIVE.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.788
THAT'S HONEST.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.590
[exhales]

24:17.624 --> 24:20.192
ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.262
IT WAS REALLY FUN WHILE
IT LASTED, THOUGH, WASN'T IT?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.598
EH.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.099
FOR ME IT WAS.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.168
OKAY.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.203
ALL RIGHT.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.275
[grunting]

24:36.308 --> 24:37.910
HEY, BOSS.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.746
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING IN TODAY.

24:39.779 --> 24:40.880
WHAT'S, UH,
GOING ON HERE?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.081
I AM GLAD
THAT YOU ASKED.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.816
LISTEN UP, EVERYBODY!

24:43.850 --> 24:46.218
IN THE LAST YEAR,
WE HAVE LOST SEVEN CLIENTS

24:46.252 --> 24:48.187
TO THE BIG CHAINS.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.957
THESE GIFT BASKETS
ARE OUR TICKET

24:50.990 --> 24:52.091
BACK INTO THEIR LIVES.

24:52.124 --> 24:55.528
WE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP
AT THESE BUSINESSES UNANNOUNCED.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.964
AND WE ARE GOING
TO WIN THEM BACK.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.031
WITH GIFT BASKETS.

24:59.065 --> 25:02.168
WITH PEANUT BRITTLE.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.936
WITH MACADAMIA NUT COOKIES.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.605
WITH CHOCOLATE TURTLES.

25:05.638 --> 25:09.542
WITH RASPBERRY JAM.

25:09.576 --> 25:12.211
AND A LITTLE BIT
OF FAT AND SALT.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.313
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LIKE.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.649
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID,

25:16.683 --> 25:18.585
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING ME
THAT I CAN'T DO THINGS.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.820
YOU CAN'T BE ON THE TEAM.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.154
YOU CAN'T MOVE ON
TO SECOND GRADE.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.256
WELL, NOW THEY'RE TELLING ME
THAT I CAN'T

25:24.290 --> 25:28.695
WIN BACK CLIENTS USING
OLD FASHIONED BUSINESS METHODS.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.764
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

25:31.798 --> 25:34.166
AND FYI, I EVENTUALLY
ACED SECOND GRADE.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.670
AND I WAS
THE BIGGEST KID IN CLASS.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.772
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP
INTO TEAMS.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.274
JIM, PHYLLIS; STANLEY, DWIGHT;
ME, ANDY.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.277
I'M NOT DRIVING WITH HIM.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.679
I'LL GO WITH YOU, STANLEY.
OR HIM.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.080
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GO BY OURSELVES?

25:48.114 --> 25:49.248
WHY DON'T
WE JUST GO AS TEAMS?

25:49.281 --> 25:50.249
TO DEMONSTRATE
OUR TEAMSMENSHIP.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.250
(Phyllis)
MICHAEL.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.251
YES.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.686
THIS IS STUPID.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.687
WHAT--OKAY.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.255
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL, PHYLLIS.

25:56.288 --> 25:57.657
HOW IS GIVING PEOPLE
GIFT BASKETS

25:57.690 --> 25:58.891
GOING TO GET
OUR CLIENTS BACK?

25:58.925 --> 26:00.927
GIFT BASKETS
ARE AMAZING, PHYLLIS.

26:00.960 --> 26:05.197
GIFT BASKETS ARE...

26:05.231 --> 26:08.067
THE ESSENCE OF CLASS
AND FANCINESS.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.037
THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE PRESENT
THAT A PERSON CAN RECEIVE.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.705
(Ed)
WHAT ABOUT CASH?

26:12.739 --> 26:13.706
CASH YOU CAN BUY
WHATEVER YOU WANT,

26:13.740 --> 26:15.608
INCLUDING A GIFT BASKET,
SO...

26:15.642 --> 26:17.109
IT'S KIND
OF THE BEST GIFT EVER.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.878
WHAT ABOUT A GIFT BASKET
FULL OF CASH?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.246
YES!
CASH BASKET!

26:20.279 --> 26:21.347
NICE WORK, TUNA.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.282
FINE, I'M JUST GONNA
GO BY MYSELF.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.084
AND I AM GOING
TO WIN THEM BACK BY MYSELF.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.187
BECAUSE THIS
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.889
MICHAEL, WAIT.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.224
LET ME GO.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.860
NO, THIS IS MY QUEST.

26:33.893 --> 26:37.063
PLEASE LET ME GO.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.699
I NEED
TO WIN THOSE CLIENTS BACK.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.300
PLEASE.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.301
(Michael)
FINE.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.004
THEN GOD SPEED.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.238
TO BOTH OF US.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.775
GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.943
WE DON'T NEED LUCK.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.344
(Dwight)
YEAH.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.813
BUT THANK YOU, THAT WAS
REALLY NICE OF YOU TO SAY.

26:53.846 --> 26:54.847
(Dwight)
THANK YOU.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.382
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS.

26:56.415 --> 26:57.750
THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.

26:57.784 --> 27:01.387
NO BLACKBERRIES,
NO WEBSITES.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.690
I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE A WEBSITE

27:03.723 --> 27:05.725
DELIVER BASKETS OF FOOD
TO PEOPLE.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.662
YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT, DAVID.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.664
I JUST FELT THAT
IF WE WERE TO DOWNSIZE KELLY,

27:11.698 --> 27:13.265
THEN OUTSOURCE
CUSTOMER SERVICE TO INDIA,

27:13.299 --> 27:16.703
WHICH A LOT OF COMPANIES...

27:16.736 --> 27:18.204
YES, NO--YES,
KELLY IS INDIAN.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.306
I UNDERSTAND
THAT'S CONFUSING.

27:21.774 --> 27:22.775
HEY, BRAH.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.943
BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU,

27:23.976 --> 27:25.878
CAN WE GET SOME RED BULL
FOR THESE THINGS?

27:25.912 --> 27:27.246
SOMETIMES A GUY'S
GOTTA RIDE THE BULL.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.247
AM I RIGHT?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.849
LATER, SKATER.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.888
SWEET RIDE.
AMERICAN MADE.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.256
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE SEBRING?

27:37.289 --> 27:39.692
IT IS IN THE BODY SHOP.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.828
I HAD TO HAVE THE DENT
TAKEN OUT OF THE HOOD

27:41.861 --> 27:42.594
WHERE I HIT MEREDITH.

27:42.628 --> 27:43.896
OH, THAT'S A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.865
I KNOW.
SO WHO'S NEXT?

27:45.898 --> 27:47.066
LARRY MEYERS.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.068
LEFT US SIX MONTHS AGO
FOR OFFICE DEPOT.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.872
(GPS voice)
PROCEED TO
THE HIGHLIGHTED ROUTE

27:52.905 --> 27:54.073
AND ROUTE GUIDANCE
WILL BEGIN.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.842
WHY DO YOU USE THAT THING?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.844
IT LETS THEM KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL TIMES.

27:57.877 --> 27:58.711
WHO?

27:58.745 --> 27:59.812
THE GOVERNMENT,

27:59.846 --> 28:03.883
SPY SATELLITES,
PRIVATE DETECTIVES.

28:03.916 --> 28:07.854
EX-GIRLFRIENDS.

28:07.887 --> 28:14.026
[crying]

28:14.060 --> 28:16.428
NEXT NIGHT
I'M OUT AT A BAR, 2:00 AM.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.629
I FIGURE
I'LL GET A SANDWICH.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.799
'CAUSE YOU CAN GET A SANDWICH
ANY TIME OF THE NIGHT.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.433
I RUN INTO VINCE VAUGHN.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.369
NO WAY.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.371
LITERALLY.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.206
DUDE, YOU ARE SO MONEY.

28:27.239 --> 28:30.276
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.378

28:32.411 --> 28:34.814
YEAH, LATER, DUDE.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.817

28:46.993 --> 28:49.195
THAT WHOLE LIFESTYLE,
HIS WHOLE VIBE?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.262
YOU FIND THAT APPEALING?

28:50.296 --> 28:54.233
OH, TUNA!

28:54.266 --> 28:55.968
TUNA TUNA TUNA.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.937
(Kevin)
TUNA TUNA TUNA.

28:57.970 --> 29:01.874
HE HAS A KILLER JOB.
HE'S RICH.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.209
HE SMELLS LIKE WHAT I THINK
PIERCE BROSNAN

29:03.242 --> 29:04.243
PROBABLY SMELLS LIKE.

29:04.276 --> 29:07.279
HE WEARS REALLY COOL

29:07.313 --> 29:08.380
RICH GUY CLOTHES.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.950
AND HE CAN GET
ANY GIRL THAT HE WANTS.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.252
(Ed)
SO, SORRY, TUNA,
BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW

29:13.285 --> 29:14.954
WHY THAT'S AWESOME,

29:14.987 --> 29:19.391
THEN...YOU NEED
AWESOME LESSONS.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.961
TUNA, CHECK YA LATER.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.997
'CAUSE HE'S SO MONEY
THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

29:25.031 --> 29:28.434
WOW, THOSE THINGS
ARE HEAVY!

29:28.467 --> 29:29.969
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
IN THERE.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.137
WE HAVE...

29:31.170 --> 29:34.306
MACADAMIA NUT COOKIES.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.876
UM, THE HONEY MUSTARD
PRETZELS.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.878
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
FOCACCIA CRISPS?

29:38.911 --> 29:41.213
YOU KNOW WE CLOSED
OUR ACCOUNT WITH YOU, RIGHT?

29:41.247 --> 29:42.381
YES, WE DO.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.449
WE'RE WITH OFFICE DEPOT NOW.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.051
YES.
YES, YES, WE KNOW.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.352
BUT WE JUST
HAVE NOT GOTTEN OVER YOU.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.386
WELL...

29:47.419 --> 29:49.188
AND WE ARE DEDICATED
TO PROVIDING YOU

29:49.221 --> 29:50.189
WITH THE VERY BEST
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.190
THIS IS TRUE.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.826
THE VERY BEST PERSONAL BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP...

29:53.860 --> 29:54.793
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.996
WE CAN IF YOU EVER DECIDE
TO COME BACK TO US.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.164
OKAY.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.899
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE COMING BACK.

29:59.932 --> 30:00.900
PLEASE COME BACK.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.334
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:02.368 --> 30:03.970
JUST ENJOY
THE GIFT BASKET.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.304
AND REMEMBER...

30:05.337 --> 30:07.940
THAT WE PROVIDE
A PERSONAL TOUCH.

30:07.974 --> 30:08.774
REMEMBER WHAT WE HAD, LARRY?

30:08.807 --> 30:11.210
I MEAN, REALLY,
IT'S ABOUT MONEY.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.879
WELL, JUST, UH,
ENJOY THE GIFT BASKET.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.914
OKAY, THANKS.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.048
ALL RIGHT.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.283
I MEAN, THEIR WEBSITE'S
REALLY EASY

30:17.316 --> 30:20.052
TO USE TOO--THAT'S A BIG DEAL
FOR US.

30:20.086 --> 30:23.990
THAT GUY WAS SO ST...

30:24.023 --> 30:25.892
HOW CAN THEY NOT KNOW
HOW MUCH BETTER WE ARE?

30:25.925 --> 30:26.725
I DON'T KNOW.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.094
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
ARE JUST IMPOSSIBLE

30:28.127 --> 30:29.095
AND THEY MAKE YOU MISERABLE.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.129
THAT IS TRUE.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.497
LIKE ANGELA IN ACCOUNTING.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.866
YES, SHE IS NUTS.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.434
UGH.
NO, SHE'S WONDERFUL.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.569
AT ACCOUNTING.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.272
BUT SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.875
(GPS)
MAKE THE NEXT RIGHT TURN.

30:42.909 --> 30:43.910
HOW DO THEY KNOW?

30:43.943 --> 30:44.977
HOW DOES THIS KNOW
WHERE TO TURN?

30:45.011 --> 30:46.245
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.547
HEY, PAM.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.516
I HAVEN'T SETTLED
ON A FINAL DESIGN LOGO YET

30:50.549 --> 30:51.984
FOR DUNDER MIFFLIN INFINITY.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.585
AND I KNOW YOU'RE
INTO GRAPHIC DESIGN.

30:53.619 --> 30:54.620
DO YOU WANNA GIVE IT A SHOT?

30:54.653 --> 30:56.288
MAYBE TRY AND DESIGN THE LOGO?

30:56.322 --> 30:57.289
UH, TOTALLY.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.391
COOL.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.027
UM, CAN YOU DO
A COUPLE MOCK-UPS

31:01.060 --> 31:02.028
AND I'LL TAKE A LOOK?

31:02.061 --> 31:03.029
YEAH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.030
THANK YOU.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.098
COOL.
OKAY.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.040
YEAH, I'M GONNA
DO SOME MOCK-UPS

31:14.073 --> 31:16.308
AND THEN TURN THOSE
INTO THUMBNAILS.

31:16.342 --> 31:20.612
MAYBE DO SOME, UH,
SPLASH FRAMES.

31:20.646 --> 31:21.680
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

31:21.713 --> 31:22.881
BUT I'M EXCITED.

31:22.915 --> 31:26.485
(Michael)
AND THE LAST GUY SAYS,
NO, HARRY BODY.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.154
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.355
AH.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.959
WELL, IT'S STILL VERY GOOD.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.327
I BET I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO HASN'T HEARD THAT JOKE.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.362
YOUR DAUGHTER EMILY.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.363
HOW'S SHE DOING?

31:37.396 --> 31:41.033
OH, SHE'S GREAT.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.368
GREAT MEMORY, BY THE WAY.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.602
SHE GONNA BE, LIKE, 11...

31:43.635 --> 31:45.037
THIS WINTER?

31:45.071 --> 31:47.373
WOW, THEY GROW UP
SO FAST.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.509
I HAVE A FEW OF MY OWN
THAT I WANT SOMEDAY.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.111
LISTEN,

31:52.144 --> 31:53.212
I DON'T WANNA TAKE
ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.213
I KNOW
YOU'RE A VERY BUSY MAN.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.714
THE REASON
WE HAVE STOPPED BY

31:55.747 --> 31:57.283
IS TO DROP YOU OFF
THIS ELABORATE

31:57.316 --> 31:59.518
BAG OF GOODIES.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.154
AND TO ASK YOU
TO RECONSIDER.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.355
OH, OKAY.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.723
OKAY?
OKAY!

32:04.756 --> 32:05.958
SO YOU'LL RECONSIDER?

32:05.992 --> 32:07.626
OKAY, THANKS FOR THE GOODIES.

32:07.659 --> 32:08.660
AH.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.435
IS THAT
ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

32:18.237 --> 32:20.239
IT LOOKS DELICIOUS?
I DON'T KNOW.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.340
YOU DON'T KNOW?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.046
LOOK, WE WANT YOU BACK.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.680
CAN YOU OFFER LOWER PRICES?

32:28.714 --> 32:30.116
WELL, NO.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.084
WELL, THEN WE'RE NOT
COMING BACK.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.085
HE'S NOT COMING BACK.
IT'S OVER, MICHAEL.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.086
NO, IT'S NOT.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.021
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.455
NO.
ACCEPT IT,
WHY WOULD HE COME BACK?

32:36.488 --> 32:38.424
WHY WOULD HE COME BACK?
I WILL TELL YOU, DWIGHT.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.659
HE WOULD COME BACK
BECAUSE WE OFFER

32:40.692 --> 32:43.362
A WIDE SELECTION
OF PRODUCTS.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.031
AND YOU'RE DEFINITELY
NOT GETTING

32:45.064 --> 32:46.132
THE SAME SORT
OF CUSTOMER SERVICE

32:46.165 --> 32:46.932
THAT YOU GET WITH US,
ARE YOU?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.567
THAT'S NOT
GONNA CHANGE HIS MIND.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.435
HE'S MOVING ON.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.738
WE HAD OUR CHANCE
AND WE KILLED IT.

32:57.109 --> 33:00.146
LOOK...

33:00.179 --> 33:04.050
WE'RE ALSO COMING OUT
WITH A WEBSITE SOON.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.018
IT'S A STATE-OF-THE-ART
THING.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.520
IT'LL BE UP AND RUNNING.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.789
IT'S GONNA CUT COSTS.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.591
AND IT WILL MAKE ORDERING
MUCH, MUCH EASIER.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.093
WELL, OKAY.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.794
WELL, WHEN IT'S UP,
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.230
AND IF IT REALLY CUTS COSTS,
MAYBE WE'LL COME BACK.

33:18.264 --> 33:21.100
GREAT.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.134
THE MAGIC
OF THE GIFT BASKET.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.036
THAT I DON'T
CARE ABOUT AS MUCH.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.037
LET ME KNOW
WHEN THE SITE'S UP.

33:25.071 --> 33:27.739
OKAY.
GOOD.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.308
DON'T LET EMILY HAVE ANY
OF THE CAJUN ALMONDS.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.376
SHE'S ALLERGIC.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.082
(GPS)
PROCEED STRAIGHT.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.049
WELL, WE'RE 0 FOR 6.

33:37.083 --> 33:40.786
LAST CHANCE
IS THE ELMHURST COUNTRY CLUB.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.654
OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE
ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.090
I DON'T GET IT.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.524
I REALLY DON'T GET IT.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.593
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.062
I THREW EVERYTHING
I HAD AT THAT GUY, NOTHING.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.531
THAT'S HOW IT GOES SOMETIMES,
YOU KNOW?

33:52.564 --> 33:55.201
YOU LOSE EVERYTHING,
AND EVERYTHING FALLS APART.

33:55.234 --> 33:59.205
AND EVENTUALLY YOU DIE
AND NO ONE REMEMBERS YOU.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.639
THAT IS A VERY GOOD POINT.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.741
(GPS)
MAKE A RIGHT TURN.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.243
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
NO, NO, NO.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.412
IT MEANS BEAR RIGHT.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.713
RIGHT THERE.
NO, IT SAID RIGHT.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.315
IT SAID TAKE A RIGHT.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.716
NO, NO, NO.
NO, LOOK.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.619
IT MEANS GO UP TO THE RIGHT,
BEAR RIGHT

34:13.652 --> 34:15.754
OVER THE BRIDGE
AND HOOK UP WITH 307.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.089
MAYBE IT'S A SHORT CUT,
DWIGHT.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.390
IT SAID GO TO THE RIGHT.

34:18.424 --> 34:19.658
IT CAN'T MEAN THAT.
THERE'S A LAKE THERE--

34:19.691 --> 34:21.527
LOOK, DWIGHT, I THINK
IT KNOWS WHERE IT'S GOING!

34:21.560 --> 34:23.329
THIS IS THE LAKE!
THIS IS THE LAKE!

34:23.362 --> 34:24.496
THE MACHINE KNOWS--
STOP YELLING AT ME!

34:24.530 --> 34:25.631
STOP YELLING!
NO, IT'S UP THERE!

34:25.664 --> 34:29.568
THERE'S NO ROAD HERE!

34:29.601 --> 34:32.604
REMAIN CALM.
I HAVE TRAINED FOR THIS.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.174
OKAY.
EXIT THE WINDOW!

34:35.207 --> 34:36.041
HERE WE GO.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.177
(GPS)
MAKE A U-TURN.
IF POSSIBLE.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.446
LOOK OUT FOR NATURE!

34:40.479 --> 34:41.713
MICHAEL!

34:41.747 --> 34:45.317
ARE YOU OKAY?
SWIM FOR IT!

34:45.351 --> 34:50.256
I GOT YOU!
I GOT YOU!

34:50.289 --> 34:52.491
MICHAEL!
MICHAEL!

34:52.524 --> 34:55.194
LET GO.
LET OF ME...

34:55.227 --> 34:57.396
[grunting]

34:57.429 --> 34:58.897
(Michael)
I'VE GOT YOU!

34:58.930 --> 35:00.266
I'VE GOT YOU!

35:00.299 --> 35:02.301
I'VE GOT YOU!
COME ON!

35:02.334 --> 35:05.304
COME ON.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.339
COME ON!

35:31.663 --> 35:33.299
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

35:33.332 --> 35:34.800
FINE.

35:34.833 --> 35:35.834
GOOD.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.570
THAT IS
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT.

35:38.604 --> 35:41.340
DID YOU GET
THE RENTAL INSURANCE?

35:41.373 --> 35:42.374
'CAUSE THAT
IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TOO

35:42.408 --> 35:45.211
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.353
WHAT A DISASTER.
THIS WHOLE THING.

35:54.386 --> 35:58.224
I'LL CALL A CAB.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.458
THESE PEOPLE
JUST DON'T REALIZE

35:59.491 --> 36:00.692
WHAT A GIFT BASKET MEANS.

36:00.726 --> 36:01.827
THEY DON'T GET IT.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.430
LOOK AT THAT, STILL WORKS.
OLD FASHIONED CELL PHONE.

36:04.463 --> 36:05.931
YEAH.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.433
WHAT ABOUT THAT LAST GUY,
AARON?

36:07.466 --> 36:08.800
BOY, WAS HE A JERK.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.703
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I WANT IT.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.406
THEIR WEBSITE, SO EASY.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.609
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR TECHNOLOGY, JACKASS.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.278
LOOK WHERE IT GOT US.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.612
YES, WE NEED A CAB
AT LAKE SCRANTON.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.614
AT THE END
OF EAST MOUNTAIN ROAD.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.816
IN THE LAKE.
HANG UP.

36:26.252 --> 36:27.219
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO?

36:27.253 --> 36:29.355
WE'RE WALKING BACK.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.257
WE'RE WALKING
BACK TO THAT OFFICE.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.359
AND WE ARE GOING TO RE-CLAIM
OUR GIFT BASKET!

36:33.392 --> 36:35.261
YES.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.363
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY OURS.

36:37.396 --> 36:41.467
WE'RE GONNA
TAKE A STAND, DWIGHT.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.468
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A STAND!

36:42.501 --> 36:43.302
TAKE A STAND!

36:43.335 --> 36:45.437
SO IT PLAYS
ON THE INFINITY THING

36:45.471 --> 36:46.872
WITHOUT BEING OBVIOUS,
YOU KNOW?

36:46.905 --> 36:48.307
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.308
UM, I'D LOVE TO DO,
LIKE, A COLOR VERSION.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.609
JUST BRING A LITTLE COLOR...

36:50.642 --> 36:51.843
I LIKE IT A LOT.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.379
IT'S CLEAR AND SUBTLE
AT THE SAME TIME.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.680
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.981
YOU HAVE A REAL TALENT
FOR THIS STUFF.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.883
THANKS.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.251
I'D LOVE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT MORE.

36:59.285 --> 37:00.719
THAT'D BE GREAT.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.522
DO YOU WANNA GO OUT
TO DINNER TONIGHT?

37:03.555 --> 37:04.823
OH, IS IT...

37:04.856 --> 37:06.258
WEAR SOMETHING NICE.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.559
NO.
WHAT?

37:07.593 --> 37:09.795
UM...
I JUST...

37:09.828 --> 37:10.962
I'M SORRY.
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE DINNER.

37:10.996 --> 37:14.400
I'M, UH...
I'M DATING JIM.

37:15.467 --> 37:19.004
YOU'RE KIDDING.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.675
WE'RE TOGETHER.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.411
THAT'S GREAT.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.778
I--THAT'S AWESOME.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.914
YEAH, GREAT.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.387
SO LET ME, UM...
LET ME LOOK AT THESE.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.789
YEAH.
OKAY, GREAT.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.425
COOL.
GREAT.

37:46.097 --> 37:51.937
I GUESS HE CAN'T GET
ANY GIRL HE WANTS.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.275
[knocking]

37:59.778 --> 38:01.513
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

38:01.547 --> 38:02.714
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

38:02.748 --> 38:04.383
GIVE IT BACK.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.086
THE GIFT BASKET.
GIVE IT BACK.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.988
OH, WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S REAL SIMPLE.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.491
IF YOU DON'T APPRECIATE
WHAT WE DO,

38:12.524 --> 38:14.393
THEN GIVE US BACK
OUR BASKET.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.561
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

38:15.594 --> 38:18.864
YEAH, MAYBE WE SHOULD.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.566
MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE.
COME ON, LET'S LEAVE.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.633
BUT BEFORE WE LEAVE,

38:21.667 --> 38:24.570
MY WET FRIEND AND I
ARE GONNA WAIT FOR OUR CABS

38:24.603 --> 38:26.938
ON YOUR NICE COUCHES!

38:26.972 --> 38:28.507
CAN YOU CALL US
A CAB, PLEASE?

38:28.540 --> 38:29.541
I'M GONNA--OH, SORRY!

38:29.575 --> 38:32.077
LOOK.
MY CLOTHES ARE SO WET.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.912
(Dwight)
NICE LEATHER.

38:33.945 --> 38:36.382
OH, MY SHOES
ARE SO MUDDY!

38:36.415 --> 38:37.749
ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO.
TAKE IT BACK!

38:37.783 --> 38:39.585
IT'S BEEN OPENED.

38:39.618 --> 38:40.619
YEAH, IT WAS MINE.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.688
WHAT'S MISSING?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.590
THE TURTLES.

38:44.623 --> 38:45.957
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES?
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.526
COME ON, GUYS.
GET OUT OF HERE.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.628
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES?!

38:49.661 --> 38:51.630
OKAY.
WHERE ARE THEY?

38:51.663 --> 38:52.931
(Dwight)
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.700
WE SEEM TO BE MISSING A BOX
OF CHOCOLATE TURTLES

38:54.733 --> 38:56.668
WITH PECANS.

38:56.702 --> 38:57.669
AND WE WILL NOT
BE LEAVING THE PREMISES

38:57.703 --> 38:58.837
UNTIL WE OBTAIN THEM.

38:58.870 --> 39:03.108
HAND OVER THE TURTLES NOW!

39:03.141 --> 39:04.476
I ATE THEM, OKAY?
I ATE THE TURTLES.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.878
THEY'RE GONE!

39:19.157 --> 39:20.426
WE'LL BILL YOU.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.597
MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

39:25.631 --> 39:28.534
THIS OFFICE
WILL NOT BE USING

39:28.567 --> 39:30.636
ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY EVER,
STARTING NOW.

39:30.669 --> 39:33.071
THAT IS NOT CORRECT.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.574
RYAN THINKS THAT TECHNOLOGY
IS THE ANSWER.

39:35.607 --> 39:36.908
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.644
I JUST DROVE MY CAR
INTO A LAKE.

39:38.677 --> 39:39.578
YOU DID WHAT?

39:39.611 --> 39:44.650
I DROVE MY CAR...
INTO A [bleep]ING LAKE.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.753
WHY, YOU MAY ASK,
DID I DO THIS?

39:47.786 --> 39:49.154
WELL...

39:49.187 --> 39:50.789
BECAUSE OF A MACHINE.

39:50.822 --> 39:53.859
A MACHINE TOLD ME
TO DRIVE INTO A LAKE.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.094
AND I DID IT.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.565
I DID IT BECAUSE I TRUSTED
RYAN'S PRECIOUS TECHNOLOGY.

39:59.598 --> 40:00.666
AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT ME.

40:00.699 --> 40:01.667
INTO A LAKE.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.769
EXACTLY.

40:03.802 --> 40:04.770
DID YOU GET
ANY CLIENTS BACK?

40:04.803 --> 40:07.573
MAYBE.
MAYBE NOT.

40:07.606 --> 40:08.674
TIME WILL TELL.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.576
BUT I WILL
TELL YOU ONE THING,

40:10.609 --> 40:13.879
THOSE GIFT BASKETS
NEVER ENDANGERED

40:13.912 --> 40:16.948
ANYBODY'S LIVES.

40:18.717 --> 40:22.220
GAME, SET, MATCH.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.890
POINT.
SCOTT.

40:24.923 --> 40:25.991
GAME OVER.

40:27.593 --> 40:30.729
END OF GAME.

40:40.205 --> 40:43.542
(Michael)
EVERYONE ALWAYS
WANTS NEW THINGS.

40:43.575 --> 40:46.177
EVERYBODY LIKES
NEW INVENTIONS.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.913
NEW TECHNOLOGY.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.915
PEOPLE WILL NEVER
BE REPLACED BY MACHINES.

40:49.948 --> 40:53.118
IN THE END,
LIFE AND BUSINESS

40:53.151 --> 40:55.754
ARE ABOUT HUMAN CONNECTIONS.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.857
AND COMPUTERS
ARE ABOUT TRYING

40:58.890 --> 41:01.660
TO MURDER YOU IN A LAKE.

41:01.693 --> 41:03.695
AND TO ME,
THE CHOICE IS EASY.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.134
I'M NOT SAYING I HAD
A METEORIC RISE.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.936
BUT I DID.

41:10.969 --> 41:14.873
AND IF THEY KNEW HOW MUCH
I WAS PAYING FOR MY HAIRCUT NOW,

41:14.906 --> 41:18.076
THEY WOULDN'T BE GIVING ME
A NOOGIE.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.111
IT WAS $200.
