00:08.926 --> 00:10.385
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.511 --> 00:11.719
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

00:11.845 --> 00:14.138
I thought I'd swing by the hospital today,
take you out to lunch.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.307
Today's awful. Can l take a rain check?

00:16.392 --> 00:19.185
lt's been raining a lot lately.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.770
Eddie, my back is killing me.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.814
-For the pain.
-Thank you.

00:24.942 --> 00:28.569
-How are we on time?
-We're good. Just don't get fancy.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.826
Family at home, boyfriend at work,
making it back in time to be with husband...

00:34.910 --> 00:36.035
Pretty impressive.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.246
Who is luckier than me?

00:40.082 --> 00:41.708
Everything's on your terms, Jackie.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.292
"Eddie, my back hurts."

00:43.419 --> 00:44.585
-Keep your fucking pills.
-Good.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.796
l don't need it. l don't need any of it.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.172
Ladies, this is Sam.

00:48.257 --> 00:51.217
You know l dismissed him because
he was wacked out on benzos?

00:51.427 --> 00:53.386
Maybe you don't want to hire a nurse
who's an addict?

00:53.470 --> 00:54.470
Former addict.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.055
What is hospital policy regarding drugs?

00:56.140 --> 00:57.557
Don't worry about it. l'll take care of it.

00:57.641 --> 00:58.725
Why so desperate?

00:58.809 --> 01:00.435
Do you want to get your ass kicked?

01:00.811 --> 01:03.104
l'll give you a dollar
if you don't go to work today.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.355
l think l need to be with her.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.941
Honey, let me take care of her, okay?
l got it.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.193
Hey, honey.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.903
Hey. Eddie. l'm a friend of Kevin's.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.072
You lie to me again, l tell him everything.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.366
Eddie used to give me some oxy,

01:15.451 --> 01:17.535
when it would get really bad.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.746
Percocet?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.038
Yes, please.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.375
Lenny is clearly into me.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.753
The heart wants what the heart wants.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.131
-You slept with my girlfriend.
-Yes, l did, my friend.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.341
Fuck!

01:33.802 --> 01:34.969
He's totally wasted.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.596
We have to keep him awake
or he's gonna aspirate.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.139
Why are you helping me?

01:38.682 --> 01:41.684
lt would mean the world
if l could set up a fund for the girls.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.145
Take the money. Get them an education.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.856
You need to promise me
that we're not gonna take that money.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.816
Okay. l promise.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.860
Have you seen your new school?

01:51.153 --> 01:52.904
Do l have a new school?

01:53.155 --> 01:54.280
Please don't do this.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.365
-Seriously, Kevin.
-Dad! Where are you going?

01:57.159 --> 01:59.869
Eddie, it's all crashing down around me.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.245
You gonna be okay?

02:01.330 --> 02:02.705
You know me.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.749
Anyone who knows you
knows they don't know you.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.502
Did she give you a whole song and dance
about her back?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.504
You can't believe a word she says.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.923
l don't know whose MRl you saw,
but it wasn't hers.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.926
You're a drug addict.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.010
lt's okay, Jacks.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.845
You have no idea what you're talking about.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.640
Yeah, you know what?
You're fucking pathetic, both of you.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.812
Hi, my name is Jackie. I'm a drug addict.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.609
Blow me.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.534
Kevin!

04:50.749 --> 04:51.958
Where the fuck are you?

04:54.962 --> 04:55.962
ls she gone?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.672
That's a nice way to treat company.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.217
O'Hara, really?
You couldn't handle this yourself?

05:04.930 --> 05:06.347
This isn't about me, Jackie.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.516
Here, take a look at this stuff, Kevin.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.268
Well, we've got razors,
fucking muscle relaxers.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.896
Half the shit on here is school supplies.

05:14.690 --> 05:15.690
Look, Gracie's eardrops,

05:16.274 --> 05:17.692
1 1 0 fucking dollars.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.152
Unless you wanna buy the generic crap,
which l don't.

05:20.612 --> 05:21.654
That's what this is.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.614
l am not talking about eardrops.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.952
Okay, we got Ambien, Vicodin.
l don't fucking sleep, Kevin.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.038
My body is falling apart.
What do you want from me?

05:31.123 --> 05:32.999
For fuck's sake, call the cops.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.333
Why aren't the girls here?

05:34.418 --> 05:37.336
They're fine. l don't keep secrets, Jackie.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.088
Kevin, neither do l.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.840
Bullshit! The credit card.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.050
Separate, not secret. Separate.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.594
Since when do l have to run
every little fucking thing by you?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.263
When have we ever done things like that?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.306
When was the last time
you bought your own razors?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.308
And you need a P.O. box to do all that?

05:51.393 --> 05:52.560
You know what? Here.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.604
Here, take the fucking key.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.234
Answer the question, Jackie.
Why do you need a P.O. box?

06:01.236 --> 06:04.238
No, forget it. Not gonna believe a word.
Doesn't matter.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.656
No, it doesn't matter. You know why?

06:05.741 --> 06:07.533
Because l keep the house stocked.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.161
That's my job because
you can't manage money.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.329
And by the way,
what message are we sending Fi?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.623
"l'm sorry,
you're just not quite as important as Grace.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.459
"We have money for her tuition,
but not yours."

06:16.543 --> 06:17.752
lt's tuition, Kevin!

06:18.336 --> 06:19.754
You find it!

06:19.838 --> 06:21.172
l should never have had to beg.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.716
For God's sake, l sure as hell
shouldn't have to sneak around.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.593
She is your daughter!

06:26.344 --> 06:29.263
You know what?
From now on, buy your own fucking razors!

06:29.890 --> 06:31.390
l'm getting my kids.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.948
-Hi, guys!
-Mom!

06:48.116 --> 06:50.117
Did you have fun?
What did you have for dinner?

06:50.202 --> 06:51.452
Bacon and Sno Balls.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.454
Bacon and Sno Balls?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.747
Yippee!

06:54.956 --> 06:57.875
And, oh, my God,
Aunt Tunie has a boyfriend that's a pilot.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.776
Can l steal you a minute?

07:29.991 --> 07:33.077
This is entirely preemptive.
There is nothing to be worried about.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.829
-Already worried.
-Don't be.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.876
l've been doing this for 20 years, Gloria.
Parts of my body are giving out.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.089
What are we preempting?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.592
l started leaning on painkillers.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.804
lt was a couple of months,
totally self-corrected.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.975
This doesn't have anything to do
with the Pill-O-Matix, does it?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.852
No, no, not at all. Nothing like that.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.856
My husband opened a credit card bill,
he saw the pharmacy charges, that's it.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.191
But he called O'Hara.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.985
-Not good.
-No.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.903
No, no, not at all. Not for anybody.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.699
l'm fine,
but he should not have called O'Hara.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.202
Her family, like, drug addicts.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.913
Like pump-your-stomach, die-in-your-sleep
drug addicts,

08:17.998 --> 08:20.708
so she had a disproportionate reaction.

08:21.501 --> 08:25.254
My husband feels like shit. He had no clue
what her deal was when he called her.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.555
l don't know what you want me to do.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.724
l don't know. She might come in here.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.642
And if she does, l would just ask

08:38.727 --> 08:41.061
that you take whatever she says
with a grain of salt, that's all.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.938
Respect your sister,
but consider the source.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.566
l'm not sure what that means, but, yes.

08:45.817 --> 08:46.817
Jackie,

08:48.028 --> 08:51.906
if a co-worker so much as
raises the specter of substance abuse,

08:51.990 --> 08:54.700
l am required by law to inform HR.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.410
That's just the way it is.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.371
Fix it.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.664
Got it.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.750
We knock, Dr. Cooper.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.713
l'm not working with Sam.
He caused me bodily harm.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.465
Zoey and what's-his-name...

09:09.549 --> 09:10.591
-Thor.
-Thor.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.968
Yeah, whatever. They're in admitting.
l want Jackie.

09:13.637 --> 09:14.887
Let's do it.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.650
Can l come in?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.281
He wanted to see his brain.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.952
l bet you are five.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.871
My name is Jackie.
Your name's Peter, right?

09:43.708 --> 09:44.792
Wow.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.670
lt's up there good, buddy.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.130
Mustang, nice.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.508
What happened to your nose?

09:53.176 --> 09:55.177
My friend Sam didn't wanna share.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.305
Mind if l give it a little tug?

09:58.556 --> 09:59.807
lt's okay.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.645
Nope, it doesn't wanna come out.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.313
lt's lodged in the sinus cavity.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.900
Let's get a film and call ENT.
l'm afraid to mess with it.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.278
Tried to look at your brain, huh?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.405
Done that.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.657
Hey, Zoey, can you grab me
some surgical booties?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.659
You're kidding. Surgery?

10:18.785 --> 10:20.869
Huh? No. Jeez, no.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.998
New shoes.
l hate to scuff 'em up on the first day.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.338
You know what? l can almost see it.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.882
lt looks like a very smart brain.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.343
You guys in a hurry?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.053
Hang tight a minute.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.849
Let's get him a scan.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.142
Nah, X-ray's okay.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.395
X-ray's great, but he wanted to see his brain.
Show him his brain.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.649
Using my powers for good. Pretty tempting.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.153
l like it. A lot.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.032
Hey, chief, l got a great idea.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.993
l've worked desperately to cultivate

11:01.077 --> 11:03.704
a remote and heartless persona
for this exact reason.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.624
Well, no, actually, it comes quite naturally.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.751
Point being,

11:08.877 --> 11:11.170
l suddenly am in the middle of something
terribly private

11:11.254 --> 11:12.504
between Jackie and her husband.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.589
And you don't like it.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.631
Obviously.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.260
And l would prefer
that we didn't work the same shifts.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.803
After 20 years' experience,

11:19.888 --> 11:22.389
Jackie has earned the right
to make her own schedule.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.185
There are very few perks
l can offer my nurses. That's one of them.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.228
So l've got to make other arrangements?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.022
lf you feel strongly about it, yes.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.319
Do you think he's right to be concerned?

11:36.654 --> 11:37.738
Not sure l follow.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.156
Pretty sure you do.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.869
He called you.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.875
l'll let you know about the schedule.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.547
The First Lady. Fabulous, isn't she?

11:56.174 --> 11:57.424
Totally.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.428
Here you go.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.181
Electrolytes, trans fat.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.058
Best hangover cure ever.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.061
Thanks for not narcing on me, man.
l'm on probation.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.192
Are you seeing this?

12:32.127 --> 12:33.127
God damn it. What?

12:33.211 --> 12:34.211
Lenny and l had sex.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.546
-Nope.
-What?

12:36.339 --> 12:38.924
Y'all's uptight. That's all l'm sayin'.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.057
Also, newsflash, he's a neat freak.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.475
Never saw that coming.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.686
'Cause l'm more of a

12:51.146 --> 12:53.313
let-it-all-hang-out kind of partner.

12:55.066 --> 12:58.652
Smooth, like a gazelle,

12:59.863 --> 13:05.159
a very satisfied, sexy gazelle,

13:06.077 --> 13:09.079
who just rolled over and wants a cigarette.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.999
You don't get to stifle me.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.835
Stifle away, ma'am.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.003
Oh, l will.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.838
Listen up, people.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.715
North General, gone.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.675
St. Vincent's, gone.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.470
Lenox Hill, chopping block.

13:25.221 --> 13:29.766
Hospitals come and go, but the sick
and injured keep getting sick and injured.

13:29.851 --> 13:30.976
Jackie, get over here.

13:32.187 --> 13:36.482
Closings equal diverted ambulances,
more walk-ins, less insurance.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.776
Bad on top of bad.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.697
But there is one bright spot,
even if it's just my bright spot.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.866
All those nurses out of work,

13:46.201 --> 13:48.911
1 0 years' experience, 20 years' experience,

13:49.037 --> 13:51.788
there's a lot of talent out on the street

13:51.873 --> 13:53.874
and l can pick 'em up for a song,
which means...

13:53.958 --> 13:57.252
We got it. l got a guy who ingested three
pints of Purell and puked up his Reglan.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.837
So if you don't mind,
l'm just gonna deal with that.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.380
No, no one's excused.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.633
You have to be on your game, all of you.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.719
You will work the schedules
you signed up for

14:06.221 --> 14:08.972
and probation will strictly be enforced.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.850
Heads will roll!

14:19.484 --> 14:21.485
lf anybody finds out that l slipped...

14:21.569 --> 14:23.987
l've got an ax l can drop
on your head at any moment.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.072
Why would l give that up?

14:25.907 --> 14:28.033
Twenty-year-old male, witnessed alert,

14:28.117 --> 14:30.494
crushed under a wall of boxes.
Ton, ton and a half.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.578
lt's gonna be okay, Tommy.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.539
Can you hear me, sir? Sir?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.415
l didn't know where he was.
l thought he was taking a nap.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.292
l'm a fucking idiot.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.087
His eyes are moving around.
That's good, right?

14:40.922 --> 14:41.922
He's in shock.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.925
One, two, three.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.429
That library, what's it called?
The one that's closing.

14:49.597 --> 14:53.100
We were packing it up,
moving things out to Kips Bay.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.103
l thought he was taking a nap.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.208
Mr. Finn? Hi. l just wanted...

15:18.293 --> 15:20.877
l keep thinking,
there are no broken bones, so...

15:21.546 --> 15:23.630
lt's not like he snapped his neck
or something.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.842
No, but it's more the amount of time
he was under the boxes.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.262
As soon as they freed him,
toxins were released into the bloodstream.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.806
We haven't started on dialysis,
but we're never really...

15:32.890 --> 15:33.974
For what?

15:34.309 --> 15:35.642
Renal failure. Kidneys.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.438
We're trying to get him to the OR right now
so we can get the bleeding to stop.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.772
l'm a fucking idiot.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.319
Do l call his mom?

15:49.699 --> 15:51.867
l need to get back in there, okay?

15:56.998 --> 15:59.499
We need to put you on a ventilator, Mr. Finn.
Can you hear me?

16:00.710 --> 16:04.171
Tommy, your mom's on her way, okay?
Everything's going to be all right.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.840
Respiratory failure.

16:06.924 --> 16:07.924
Yes, l can see that.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.761
And there goes the heart.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.930
l need a minute.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.351
This is not survivable.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.274
lt's not.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.995
lt was Finn & Son before l even had him.

16:37.789 --> 16:38.789
That's the truth.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.754
He isn't gonna die
before she gets here, is he?

16:46.547 --> 16:48.215
No, he's on life support.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.759
'Cause she will fucking kill me.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.393
lt was like an hour and a half. Maybe two.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.190
And l'm getting more and more pissed,
'cause l'm lugging boxes.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.235
l'm thinking, "Where is he?

17:08.611 --> 17:10.612
"Sleeping? Flirting?"

17:11.489 --> 17:13.031
Anybody else, fired.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.159
But he's my kid.

17:20.581 --> 17:21.915
And he's not sleeping.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.836
And he's not flirting.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.094
He's pinned under two tons of books.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.974
lt's my kid.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.407
He made me lunch.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.497
Are you hungry?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.666
No, thanks.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.339
Please.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.013
Thank you.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.529
You got kids?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.828
You want to enroll her now?

18:41.954 --> 18:42.913
ls that a problem?

18:42.997 --> 18:43.997
No.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.417
lt's just that we usually have
a preliminary meeting with both parents.

18:47.502 --> 18:51.004
Well, we already did all that
when we enrolled Grace.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.174
Second-child discount, yes?

18:54.425 --> 18:57.677
Yes. But we'd love to talk with your wife.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.387
She's not available.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.473
ER nurse, crazy hours.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.352
From now on, l'd prefer if you dealt
with me regarding the girls. Got it?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.523
-Yes, but your wife...
-What, Sister? My wife what?

19:13.444 --> 19:14.611
Let's do this.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.697
l can pay half the tuition now.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.868
There's an additional discount
if you pay the full amount.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.580
Half. l can do half.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.749
Split it up between these three.

19:29.377 --> 19:32.921
And l need to be made
the emergency contact for both girls.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.417
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.419
-What are you doing?
-Where is the paper tape?

20:15.506 --> 20:16.715
Okay.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.884
Teriyaki wrap?

20:20.386 --> 20:24.222
Yeah. Yeah, we probably
shouldn't be sharing meals.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.307
Yeah, l know.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.852
Excellent! You're both here.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.938
Yeah, no, actually,
Jackie was just leaving and...

20:32.106 --> 20:33.940
No. Here, this'll just take a sec.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.235
Guess how much these shoes cost.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.448
Come on, just give it a good guess.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.742
Absolutely not.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.786
All l remember was being really shit-faced

20:46.871 --> 20:50.624
and you and Jackie, like, tap danced for me?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.292
Yes, yes, we did.

20:52.835 --> 20:53.835
Why?

20:53.920 --> 20:54.920
To punish you.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.385
-Watch out!
-Oh, my God.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.180
You did not just mime
a smoking gun and holster.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.391
Why won't you let me talk to you
about sexy time with Lenny?

21:08.476 --> 21:09.851
Because you call it sexy time.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.062
He's much more oral than you'd expect.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.146
Stop.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.733
Sam, l have a sensitivity question
about boy piercings.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.069
-Balls or shaft?
-Don't encourage her.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.320
-Shaft.
-l should've let you die

21:20.404 --> 21:21.988
when l had the chance.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.325
May l help you?

21:25.409 --> 21:26.660
l'm here to see Jackie Peyton.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.370
And you are?

21:28.663 --> 21:29.663
Her husband.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.499
Jackie's not married.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.875
Yes, she is.

21:34.835 --> 21:38.171
Would you be so kind as to

21:38.839 --> 21:43.343
perhaps show me some lD, perhaps?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.609
Very photogenic.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.279
-$1 7.
-No.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.281
More. Way more.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.616
$1 0,000.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.285
Okay, no. You're not even trying.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.965
Jackie. Your husband is here to see you.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.554
Low blow, Zoey. No, come on,
it's not like anyone married you either.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.639
Jackie is married, you stupid fucking goat.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.475
She is? Wait, you are? She is?

22:37.648 --> 22:42.277
Shit, man! l am having an "aha" moment
like you can't even believe.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.738
Now l get it. She was into me.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.822
She was into Eddie.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.574
-Zoey.
-What? She was.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.826
l highly doubt Jackie does it
with just anyone.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.244
-Zoey!
-Dude!

22:51.495 --> 22:52.787
-Dude. Dude!
-l could be wrong.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.082
And the husband, really good looking.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.501
Another brother's lady?

23:00.588 --> 23:02.088
Not cool, mister.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.423
You fucked Sam's girlfriend.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.556
Cluster-fudge. l am out.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.152
l can see why she keeps him locked away.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.029
Can you lip-read?

23:34.789 --> 23:36.206
Yikes. Private.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.957
Can you keep your voice down, Kevin?

23:38.125 --> 23:41.753
l had to show lD 'cause no one around here
even knows you're fucking married.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.004
God damn it, Jackie!

23:43.089 --> 23:44.089
What, Zoey?

23:44.173 --> 23:47.008
Today is her first day, Kevin.
How the hell is she supposed to know?

23:47.134 --> 23:48.134
Jesus Christ.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.136
l just laid out two grand

23:50.930 --> 23:52.972
for Fiona's tuition, all right?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.224
l'm paying every penny.

23:54.892 --> 23:55.892
Me.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.560
She starts Monday.

23:57.770 --> 23:58.853
Does she know?

24:00.439 --> 24:03.066
Jackie, this is between you and me,
right here.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.362
Rough day.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.937
You broke my heart, Jackie.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.775
Hello? ls this thing on?

25:28.235 --> 25:29.652
Hey. Hello?

25:30.279 --> 25:31.321
Hello?

25:32.907 --> 25:34.657
Do you mind if l give it a shot?

25:34.950 --> 25:35.950
Tough crowd.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.163
Hey, Pete. Take a look at this thing.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.372
Holy cow.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.542
You see that part right over there?
That is your curiosity.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.295
That is very highly developed.
You should be very proud of that.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.715
This part over here,
that is why you are so popular.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.676
That's the part where
all your coolness is stored.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.763
And this part down here,
right on the bottom,

25:56.847 --> 25:58.806
that is what we call your common sense.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.477
lt looks to me, young man,
like you are going to be a very smart guy.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.396
You think you can handle that, Pete?

26:05.898 --> 26:06.898
Are you sure?

26:09.777 --> 26:11.069
That was awesome.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.447
lt was very nice to meet you, Pete.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.493
Honestly, Zoey,
it's not in my job description

26:18.619 --> 26:19.911
to keep track of you people.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.085
What's going on?

26:27.169 --> 26:30.588
That was weird. l asked where you were
and she bit my head off.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.383
She lost somebody.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.761
Were you there?

26:37.638 --> 26:38.638
Yeah.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.290
Hot dogs!

27:06.000 --> 27:08.418
-Dad's at bat.
-Yeah. Go, Kevin!

27:08.544 --> 27:10.253
Kevin!

27:12.673 --> 27:13.881
ls this Coke or Pepsi?

27:13.966 --> 27:15.675
lt's whatever you want it to be, honey.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.054
Did you lose something?

27:20.806 --> 27:22.432
Percocet. Last one.

27:33.694 --> 27:34.694
lt's right here.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.033
Neck spasms.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.374
Thank you.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.382
That shit'll kill ya.
