Hello!

01:02.187 --> 01:05.899
Welcome.<i> </i>Thank you so much
for sharing your evening with me.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.942
What a thrill to be here

01:08.026 --> 01:09.944
in what's left of America.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.823
You've done an amazing job with it. Um...

01:13.907 --> 01:15.658
My name is Katherine,

01:15.742 --> 01:17.577
and for the last year or so,

01:17.660 --> 01:19.496
I've been touring around the UK,

01:19.788 --> 01:22.082
um, mostly making people very angry.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.626
I'm not really sure
what makes them so angry.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.003
Uh, all that it is, I suppose,

01:27.087 --> 01:30.256
is that I am a woman who is 35 years old,

01:30.340 --> 01:32.092
and I don't have a boyfriend

01:32.175 --> 01:34.052
and I don't want a boyfriend.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.347
I love men,
but I feel that men are like dolphins,

01:37.430 --> 01:39.641
in that they should be enjoyed on holiday.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.064
And they're very intelligent,

01:46.147 --> 01:48.108
almost as smart as people.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.025
It's...

01:51.986 --> 01:55.156
But that doesn't mean you should
have one in your house. Why would you...

01:56.533 --> 01:59.160
What a disaster that would be.
What do they even eat?

02:00.161 --> 02:03.540
And a large number of them
turn out to be sexual predators as well.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.419
Hashtag #notalldolphins,
but many dolphins.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.215
They are the chimpanzees of the sea.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.635
I feel that men are nature's gun.

02:15.718 --> 02:19.722
You know, you're statistically most likely
to be killed by the one in your house.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.729
That's the bit
they get mad about. That's...

02:27.522 --> 02:28.815
That's probably it.

02:29.941 --> 02:30.984
"Well, Katherine, no,

02:31.067 --> 02:34.070
statistically, men are
most likely to be victims of homicide."

02:34.154 --> 02:36.030
True. Who's killing them?

02:38.449 --> 02:40.034
Ghosts? It's not us.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.204
Women don't have time to kill men.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.998
First of all,
we wish you no specific harm.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.749
And also, we're very busy.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.878
When women do, unfortunately,
commit murder, it's, like, a big deal.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.714
They get a whole sit-down interview
with Piers Morgan.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.092
And if that's not
dangling a carrot, like...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.472
Come on ladies, one more time.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.476
Uh, there's been some feedback,
and I enjoy taking it on board.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.313
They say, um... "Katherine,
you need to work harder

03:08.396 --> 03:11.274
on making your show a safe space for men."

03:12.275 --> 03:13.568
Um...

03:14.569 --> 03:16.571
There've been a lot of suggestions
on how to do it.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.364
So, number one,

03:18.448 --> 03:21.367
if men are uncomfortable,
just have sandwiches ready

03:21.451 --> 03:23.286
to deliver to them.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.163
Uh, that should help. Oh!

03:25.246 --> 03:29.209
Someone said perhaps I should do
the entire show as their mother.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.879
But that's a lot of admin,
and I don't have time for...

03:32.962 --> 03:36.633
Someone said, "Maybe build a set
like an entire kitchen,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.636
and then you'd be performing
in a familiar environment."

03:40.595 --> 03:43.640
But I just think
they should grow a dick instead.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.559
But-- Yeah.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.521
As I have done. Um...

03:51.940 --> 03:54.108
'Cause comedy
is a completely safe space for men.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.737
Men have a lot of safe spaces,
like the Senate and the world and...

03:58.404 --> 03:59.447
comedy.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.200
Um, I get it, I'm a woman

04:02.283 --> 04:05.495
who has ideas and opinions
and I say those out loud on a stage.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.330
People are like...

04:08.039 --> 04:10.083
"Why doesn't she just sing a song?"

04:11.751 --> 04:14.629
I don't know, but I can't tell you
how much stand-up comedy

04:14.712 --> 04:17.048
I have had to listen to in my career
where men are like,

04:17.632 --> 04:23.263
"If I'm fuckin' a hooker and she comes,
I'm askin' for my money back."

04:23.346 --> 04:24.180
It's like...

04:24.889 --> 04:26.516
is she gonna give you
pretend money back?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.935
Like, "Seven, eight..."
'cause she didn't come.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.228
Um...

04:32.313 --> 04:33.481
Here you go,

04:33.564 --> 04:34.899
and your change.

04:34.983 --> 04:35.984
Um...

04:36.401 --> 04:37.944
I'm just not good at dating.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.445
I tried it on for a little while.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.739
And for everyone's better life,

04:41.823 --> 04:43.992
I've taken myself out of the game,

04:44.075 --> 04:47.078
and then loads of people in my life
want me to get back into the game.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.205
Why? Why do I have to be like you?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.832
If I were this bad at anything else--

04:50.915 --> 04:54.794
If I were a surgeon
who managed to kill every patient...

04:55.586 --> 04:57.880
and burn down the palliative care unit...

04:59.340 --> 05:01.384
pretty sure my friends and family
would not be like,

05:01.467 --> 05:05.096
"Katherine, when are you gonna get back
in the emergency room, girl?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.392
Just one more try."

05:10.810 --> 05:12.270
I'm not gonna be single forever.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.980
I think the ladies will agree with me,

05:14.063 --> 05:17.025
35, far too young to settle down

05:17.108 --> 05:18.693
and have a man in your house.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.737
-Far too young.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.488
-Dangerously young.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.781
You don't think so, sir?

05:25.450 --> 05:28.161
You look... Oh, oh, oh.
You're just pointing at a nearby woman.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.287
"Talk to her."

05:33.249 --> 05:35.835
Have I made you uncomfortable already?
My goodness.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.172
I don't have any sandwiches on me.
Perhaps if I speak to you from my knees.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.173
Sir.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.511
What more can I do?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.264
Um, does he belong to you?

05:50.099 --> 05:52.143
-That's wonderful news. What's your name?
-Michelle.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.062
-Michelle? And what's your name, sir?
-Joseph.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.105
Joseph? Well done. Um...

05:58.191 --> 05:59.067
It's okay.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.194
-Do you keep this man in your house?
- I do.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.446
You do? Oh, my goodness. For how long?

06:04.072 --> 06:05.198
Almost six years.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.409
Six years in the house, Joseph!
And what do you do in there?

06:10.286 --> 06:11.371
I clean the kitchen.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.081
You clean the kitchen.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.458
That's very good.
What else do you get up to in the house?

06:15.958 --> 06:17.960
- Video games.
- Video games.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.545
-You do what?
- Video games.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.256
-Video games. You look-- You're allowed.
- Yeah!

06:22.757 --> 06:25.051
He's just shamefully withdrawn, like...

06:25.134 --> 06:27.595
"I play video games."

06:28.471 --> 06:30.306
"I wank into a mirror."

06:32.225 --> 06:34.560
You're allowed to do all those things,
Joseph, okay.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.812
Um, do you-- do you work?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.647
-Are you a stay-at-home husband?
-Yes. I work.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.273
No, you work, good.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.983
And how long are you out of the house for?

06:41.067 --> 06:43.861
-How many hours do you get away?
-  Oh, gosh. At least seven.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.321
Seven hours, okay.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.240
Oh, I could maybe live with that one day.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.450
-So you get some exercise and come back.
-Yes.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.618
What do you do together?

06:51.869 --> 06:53.621
Is he sexually adventurous?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.959
- That's for you.
- Oh God, I...

06:58.042 --> 06:58.960
-No?
-I don't...

07:01.421 --> 07:03.423
-Not after six years, Joseph.
- Less lately.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.758
No one's expecting a miracle.
You're all right.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.637
-Okay, but you're an asset to the house?
-Yeah.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.930
-Great, and you get along?
-Yes.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.932
- Yes. Sometimes.
-Absolutely wonderful.

07:13.015 --> 07:16.102
Even though you're clearly far too young
to have a man in your house.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.813
-How old are you? Do you mind if I ask?
- 35.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.356
35! Exactly.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.607
Golden age.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.860
Listen, I'm glad
that it's working out for you,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.988
because I have considered allowing a man
like you, Joseph, into my...

07:27.447 --> 07:30.116
house and... et cetera, but...

07:31.492 --> 07:32.368
Um...

07:32.452 --> 07:35.705
I just feel like, right now,
it's best if I stay single

07:35.788 --> 07:38.624
until I am the age
that Céline Dion is now.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.421
-Yeah, do you know Céline Dion, Joseph?
-Not personally.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.131
-Oh, she--
-She loves her.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.883
Yeah!
You love her,  I love her.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.759
Who doesn't love Céline Dion?

07:51.387 --> 07:52.805
Céline Dion

07:52.889 --> 07:57.560
is an entire OJ Simpson prison sentence
and a half older than I am.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.692
See?

08:04.775 --> 08:07.945
And there's not a person here
who wouldn't fuck Céline Dion.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.573
You grow in value.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.117
Céline Dion is a freak in the streets
and a freak in the sheets.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.911
You can be both at that age.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.330
Céline Dion is the face of Dior.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.956
Céline Dion is living her best life.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.126
She has released albums in Japanese,
Mandarin Chinese,

08:22.210 --> 08:25.880
Latin, German, Spanish,
Italian, French, English...

08:25.963 --> 08:27.965
The current president
of the world's largest economy

08:28.049 --> 08:30.843
cannot even speak one of those languages.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.393
Céline Dion is kicking it in the dick.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.478
Why?

08:41.771 --> 08:44.357
Why? Because her husband is dead.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.194
He's dead.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.322
He's dead!

08:51.864 --> 08:54.617
Bye-bye, René. <i>Au revoir, monsieur.</i>

08:55.201 --> 08:57.578
He's dead. And don't get it twisted.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.997
It's not that I think
the only good husbands are dead ones.

09:00.081 --> 09:04.168
It's that I know Céline Dion's husband
met her when he was 38 years old

09:04.252 --> 09:05.962
and she was, does anybody know?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.047
- 12.
-Yes, you people know.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.757
She was 12.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.468
She was 12,

09:12.552 --> 09:15.763
and the whole world collectively decided
to let that one slide.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.559
They're like, "Bah, I don't know,
Céline Dion, she knew what she was doing."

09:19.642 --> 09:21.102
Now, I do have to say,

09:21.185 --> 09:22.520
he met her when he was 38

09:22.603 --> 09:24.272
and she was 12, and they worked together.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.481
He was her manager.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.318
Just, you know, in charge of her
day-to-day affairs, like a father figure.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.863
And nothing sexual happened
between them until the magical evening

09:32.947 --> 09:34.991
of her 18th birthday
when they fell in love.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.328
That's the legal bit for Netflix.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.371
Uh...

09:42.957 --> 09:45.376
So I don't really know
who the true victim is there.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.005
I kind of feel like
it's R Kelly, somehow. It's...

09:50.464 --> 09:51.591
It is him.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.511
Poor R Kelly.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.807
He's over here trapped in the closet,
looking at this relationship like, "What?

10:00.933 --> 10:04.520
I would've been so much less creepy
if I grew up in Marseille! Why?"

10:05.563 --> 10:07.648
Life's not fair, that's why.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.443
But just currently, I don't know,
I'm having an amazing time.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.111
I have a beautiful daughter...

10:12.194 --> 10:13.946
uh, who's British.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.033
And I really recommend
having an English child.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.827
It's like having a tiny,
ineffective butler at home.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.416
Aw, she's got me feeling
like the Fresh Prince all day.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.668
"I'm ever so sorry, Mummy.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.129
I appear to have mashed Nutella
into the carpet again."

10:32.214 --> 10:34.925
I'm like, "You did.
You are the shittiest butler in the world.

10:35.551 --> 10:39.138
But I love you, and hey, where's
Mummy's drink, though? Where is it?"

10:40.097 --> 10:41.849
"Oh, oh, I do apologize, Mummy.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.435
Would you like a day wine
or a night wine?"

10:45.645 --> 10:46.646
Isn't that so cute?

10:46.729 --> 10:50.816
She thinks white wine is for the day
and red wine is for the night.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.654
And she's not wrong, is she?
She's a very...

10:55.571 --> 10:57.406
very perceptive little girl.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.326
If you wanna mess with her head,
ask for wine about 5:30.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.870
She just looks at the sun,
like, "Oh, goodness me.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.873
Is it day or...

11:06.499 --> 11:07.333
Oh, no...

11:07.416 --> 11:08.876
Would you ladies like a rosé?"

11:08.959 --> 11:09.919
"Fuck off.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.089
We're not in France."

11:14.090 --> 11:15.549
She's a wonderful child.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.344
She's absolutely wonderful. She's the kind
of kid that stitches you up.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.388
She never has a tantrum,
she's very polite.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.557
But if she is mad at me, she'll just wait
three days, till we visit friends,

11:23.641 --> 11:24.558
and she'll say to them,

11:24.642 --> 11:26.268
"Have you got any apples?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.270
I haven't had an apple in weeks."

11:28.354 --> 11:29.188
Lie.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.607
Just a lie.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.151
She'll say,
"My mummy hides wine in the walls."

11:36.404 --> 11:39.031
You know that's a wine rack.
I'm not hiding it there.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.076
That's where it goes.

11:46.455 --> 11:50.084
I love being a mother, but I am dealing
with a real prick on the school run.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.587
Does anyone know Jane from North London?
Do you guys know this prick?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.632
You get out to Primrose Hill much? No?

11:57.216 --> 12:00.219
So Jane used to have
a corporate career. And that's fine.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.848
And now Jane stays home
to look after seven tiny children.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.183
And that, ladies, is also fine.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.353
Apart from I did not know
you could have that many that fast.

12:09.645 --> 12:10.771
I genuinely did not.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.525
Her eldest daughter is the same age
as my only daughter,

12:14.608 --> 12:16.694
and then I blinked
and she shot out six more,

12:16.777 --> 12:18.487
just like... rrrrrrrrrr!

12:18.571 --> 12:20.614
Jane's having a baby
every four months, somehow.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.950
Jane, she keeps it together.

12:23.033 --> 12:26.120
Jane has an ass like a peach,
cervix like a Hula-Hoop.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.121
Just...

12:28.164 --> 12:29.457
Boom! Boom!

12:29.582 --> 12:31.709
Shooting them out, back on the school run.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.298
Jane's involved in all the fundraising
at the children's school,

12:37.381 --> 12:40.509
and she's on my dick
about the cake sale every other month.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.345
Just, "Katherine,
will you help with the cake sale?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.306
Katherine, you didn't sign up
for the cake sale.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.682
How many cakes will you make?"

12:46.766 --> 12:49.018
Finally, I put my foot down.
I said, "None.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.439
Because the last time I helped you,
you sold my cakes for ten cents."

12:54.690 --> 12:57.401
She sold them for ten cents each.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.987
"Are we selling these cakes
for Bangladeshi kids

13:00.070 --> 13:01.781
or to Bangladeshi kids, Jane?

13:08.037 --> 13:09.830
Where are you getting
your price point, prick?

13:09.914 --> 13:11.874
Where's your scale of economies at, huh?

13:11.957 --> 13:15.669
How and when were you ever effective
in the corporate world, bitch?"

13:18.839 --> 13:21.509
Don't let these people trick you.
They don't even need money.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.093
They just wanna take your time.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.388
I said, "If it is about the money, Jane,
how about I cut you a check for $100,

13:26.472 --> 13:29.183
you fuck off and make 1,000 cupcakes?"

13:31.685 --> 13:33.187
That is how many it is.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.817
Jane has a ham-colored husband
call Brian.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.528
Oh!

13:41.695 --> 13:42.988
You do know Jane.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.702
I have never seen Brian
out of a bicycle helmet in my entire life.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.414
And I have never seen a bicycle.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.542
There may not be a bicycle.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.879
Brian's out there,
riding a bicycle of the mind.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.926
But it gives me some insight into...
Men have identity issues, as well.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.678
He's about 45,

14:05.761 --> 14:07.847
and when he makes those cameos
on the school run,

14:07.930 --> 14:09.932
he wants everyone to know he's still fit.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.642
Bicycle helmet, workout gear,

14:11.725 --> 14:14.311
full spandex,
he's circumcised, you can tell.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.525
"Just here to collect my children."

14:20.484 --> 14:23.863
Brian runs marathons.
The worst kind of prick, by the way.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.156
What is it about a middle-aged man,

14:26.240 --> 14:30.160
he's gotta know he can be 26 miles away
from home on foot at any given moment?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.705
Y'all just start running around, like...

14:33.080 --> 14:36.000
"I'm raising awareness for cancer!"

14:36.083 --> 14:37.585
"We've heard of it. Sit down.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.426
It's deeply popular."

14:48.971 --> 14:50.848
And Jane loves Brian very much.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.516
And I'm very happy for them.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.269
That is the traditional shape of a family.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.646
And there's some people,
that if you deviate,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.356
especially as a woman,

14:59.440 --> 15:02.026
from being the type of person
they understand,

15:02.109 --> 15:03.277
they just can't deal with it.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.486
Jane is one of these people.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.114
She looks at me and she says,
"Oh, Katherine,

15:07.197 --> 15:08.824
you are alone.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.037
I would be so sad if I were alone."

15:13.120 --> 15:15.831
I said, "I'd be sad
if I was alone with you too, Jane.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.294
But when I'm alone,
I get to hang out with me."

15:20.419 --> 15:22.004
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah! ♪</i>

15:23.464 --> 15:25.758
She goes,
"Oh, but surely you're very worried.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.428
Aren't you worried
that you're running out of time

15:29.511 --> 15:31.221
to have another baby?"

15:31.305 --> 15:33.140
I said, "We're all running
out of time, Jane.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.308
That's how time works.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.103
If anything, I have more time than you do

15:38.187 --> 15:41.482
'cause I don't have to help find
14 tiny shoes every morning.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.819
And I don't have to sleep
with your husband.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.365
No, I fuck him 'cause I want to.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.950
I don't have to do it."

15:52.743 --> 15:55.079
That's what makes it fun. Thank you.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.873
"My body, my choice, Jane." Uh...

15:59.124 --> 16:01.794
No, don't panic.
I'm not sleeping with Brian.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.587
Of course I'm not sleeping with Brian.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.631
Though I would hate fuck Brian.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.259
Um... But don't-- It's just because
I'm an excellent mother.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.555
I'll tell you what I mean.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.432
So their eldest daughter, Hannah,

16:15.516 --> 16:18.310
has been bullying
my angel daughter, Violet.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.854
And she and I have
very different personalities.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.983
My daughter gets deeply wounded
by bullying

16:24.066 --> 16:25.818
because she just lives with me,

16:25.901 --> 16:28.487
and at home, I'm nice to her all the time.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.364
We're not like a mom and a nine-year-old.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.865
We are like two nine-year-olds,

16:31.949 --> 16:33.784
but one of us has cellulite
and a credit card.

16:33.867 --> 16:34.785
It's amazing.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.621
"It's her." "It's me." Um...

16:39.081 --> 16:41.500
And we have all those little,
teeny, tiny dogs.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.544
You know, the ones
that men won't let you get?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.505
The ones that just shiver
and piss from their eyes.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.760
I got 40 of them.
There's no one to stop me.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.764
And I could handle bullying.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.808
I mean, I was the only child in the world

16:57.891 --> 17:01.645
who believed my mother when she said,
"They're just jealous, Katherine."

17:01.729 --> 17:03.105
I was like, "Girl, I know.

17:07.776 --> 17:10.320
They could have victimized
any girl in the school,

17:10.404 --> 17:11.905
but they chose me."

17:12.823 --> 17:15.034
And one other girl
with a cleft palate and one leg.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.494
But we were the Kim and Kanye
of the fourth grade.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.540
'Cause the only other place I'd seen
women victimized for their looks

17:21.623 --> 17:22.583
was in magazines.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.794
So when it happened to me,
I was like, "Ah, I have arrived!"

17:26.754 --> 17:27.588
I was bulletproof.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.673
They'd throw paper
at my head in class, I'd be like,

17:29.757 --> 17:32.926
"Who should I make this out to?"
and thank them for their support.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.180
I don't have a child like that.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.682
She cries,
she doesn't want to go to school anymore.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.309
And teachers, if you're in,

17:40.392 --> 17:43.687
you do not get paid enough
for the tremendous job that you do.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.565
And that's why I take my beef
to the streets.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.401
I went straight to Jane.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.279
I said, "Jane, the girls are not
getting along. Violet is very upset.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.865
I would appreciate it if you could have
meaningful conversations

17:54.948 --> 17:56.075
about empathy in your home."

17:56.158 --> 17:58.243
Jane, for the first time,
wanted no involvement.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.747
She said, "Meh...
Why don't we let the school deal with it?"

18:01.830 --> 18:02.831
I was like, 'Meh...

18:03.290 --> 18:05.125
"Why don't I fuck your man?"

18:08.921 --> 18:12.174
Yes, 'cause I've been watching
a troubling amount of <i>Love & Hip Hop.</i>

18:17.221 --> 18:20.140
And I will break up a family
on a Tuesday afternoon.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.267
Of course I will.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.729
What kind of mother are you if you're not
prepared to weaponize your pussy

18:25.813 --> 18:27.648
against the enemies of your children?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.029
We've got a lot of good moms in tonight.

18:34.613 --> 18:38.367
I will hate fuck the absolute shit
out of Brian.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.827
I will let him keep the helmet on.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.745
He'll need it. How about that?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.376
I don't wanna do it, I really don't.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.044
That's why I think the best thing to do

18:49.128 --> 18:51.463
would just be
to gently threaten the child.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.382
Just like, "Good morning, Hannah!

18:53.465 --> 18:56.135
Are you gonna be nice today?
Mm, I hope so.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.721
Hey, how'd you like to spend every other
weekend on the highway, huh?

19:00.848 --> 19:03.308
You're about to have
two Christmases, bitch. I--"

19:09.398 --> 19:11.400
Being a single mom's not for everyone...

19:12.151 --> 19:13.777
um, but it certainly is for me.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.823
And I think I co-parent
with Violet's father quite successfully.

19:17.906 --> 19:22.035
If you are co-parenting, you have
to be nice about the other partner.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.788
"Oh, I know he was a monster to me,
but she does this..."

19:24.872 --> 19:26.790
It doesn't matter. He's no one to me.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.167
He's my child's dad,

19:28.250 --> 19:30.669
and for that reason,
I shall never say a bad word about him.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.172
Uh, my parents do not have
the same ethos.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.508
I remember, one evening, I was in bed,

19:36.592 --> 19:39.761
and I overheard my father
calling my mother a whore.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.514
And I had a great sense of justice.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.267
And so I appeared at the top
of the stairs in my jammies,

19:45.350 --> 19:46.602
and I said, "Daddy!"

19:46.685 --> 19:48.270
He said, "Yes?" And I said,

19:49.146 --> 19:50.856
"Grandma's a whore!

19:55.777 --> 19:59.281
How do you like it when someone
calls your mother a whore?"

20:03.785 --> 20:05.495
He did not. He did not.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.540
-And...

20:08.957 --> 20:12.211
I mean, admittedly at the time,
I didn't know what a whore was.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.213
Uh, and I can just tell you privately,

20:14.296 --> 20:16.048
Margaret Ryan, my grandma,

20:16.131 --> 20:19.468
absolute Irish Catholic saint,
could not have been less of a whore.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.013
Compared to her, my mother
absolutely was a whore, so...

20:24.598 --> 20:27.559
that was my bad on that one,
I hold my hands up, that was...

20:27.643 --> 20:30.687
Uh... My mom's kind of like Frank Sinatra,
but really sexy.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.691
She's just always smoking near,
like, Scotch and a piano,

20:34.775 --> 20:37.236
just doing a few kick ball changes.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.406
"How's England, doll?" "It's fine."

20:42.741 --> 20:43.575
Um...

20:43.659 --> 20:45.744
The trouble is, children are smart.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.080
My daughter's nine years old,
she's got eyes in her head,

20:48.163 --> 20:50.624
so she's started to ask
some very troubling questions.

20:50.707 --> 20:54.586
She says, "Mummy, do you think
my daddy is a wonderful man?"

20:55.003 --> 20:56.171
I'm like, "Wonderful?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.674
He is the greatest man
that I have ever known."

20:59.007 --> 21:00.092
She says, "All right, Mummy.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.803
Do you think my daddy is a clever man?"

21:02.886 --> 21:05.639
I'm like, "Clever? Try genius.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.516
Some people say gambling problem,

21:07.599 --> 21:10.602
I say wealth management strategy!

21:12.562 --> 21:14.398
Your father is going straight to the top."

21:14.481 --> 21:16.191
She says, "All right, Mummy. Um...

21:16.275 --> 21:19.111
Do you think my daddy
is a very, very handsome man,

21:19.194 --> 21:20.696
and do you fancy my daddy?"

21:20.779 --> 21:23.907
That's a tough one, but I persist.
I'm like...  "Yes.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.286
Your father is the most beautiful man
I've ever laid eyes upon.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.037
I lust for him every evening."

21:29.121 --> 21:30.998
She's like, "Ew, all right. Um...

21:31.081 --> 21:34.710
Well, Mummy, but if all that is true,

21:34.793 --> 21:37.713
how come my daddy's not your boyfriend?"

21:37.796 --> 21:39.715
They're smart. Aren't they smart?

21:39.798 --> 21:42.634
You have to think on your feet as
a single mom. I'm like, "Great question.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.178
That is because... he...

21:45.679 --> 21:47.681
is too good for me."

21:50.017 --> 21:53.145
She's like, "Is he, Mummy?
Really? Are you sure?"

21:53.228 --> 21:54.938
"Yes, your father is out of my league.

21:55.022 --> 21:58.567
I am not good enough for him.
That's how amazing your father is."

21:58.650 --> 22:00.736
She's like, "What?
But, Mummy, you're on television.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.155
He hasn't even got a microwave.
Are you sure?"

22:06.199 --> 22:07.534
He could have a microwave.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.162
He doesn't believe in microwaves.
La-la-la. Um...

22:12.914 --> 22:15.792
A lot of our arguments when we were
together were very microwave-based,

22:15.876 --> 22:16.960
so watch out for that.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.505
And I said,
"Yes, Violet, you've got it right.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.216
I love everything about him.
I miss him, I fancy him, all of that."

22:23.300 --> 22:24.760
She's like, "I don't understand.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.928
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'm seeing Daddy on Friday.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.765
I'll tell him how much you love him,
how much you miss him.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.808
Quite easily,
I think I'll get you back together."

22:31.892 --> 22:35.103
I don't have to worry. He's a really
good dad, so I know what he'll say.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.272
He's gonna say,
"Yes, your mother is a very calm,

22:37.356 --> 22:39.358
forgiving, low-maintenance woman.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.237
Of course, I fancy your mother,

22:44.321 --> 22:46.281
but she is too good for me."

22:46.865 --> 22:49.493
And so we've worked it out
that Violet thinks she has two parents

22:49.576 --> 22:51.495
who are very much in love,

22:51.578 --> 22:54.373
but just with bottom-of-the-barrel
self-esteem problems.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.379
And that is how
British children are raised.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.716
I was out in the game,

23:04.800 --> 23:08.303
I was out for a little while, accidentally
falling in love here and there.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.305
And there was a man that I thought,

23:10.389 --> 23:13.225
"Oh, maybe I will allow him
into my house one day."

23:13.308 --> 23:15.268
I didn't know, really,
what was gonna happen,

23:15.352 --> 23:18.146
and then he made the decision for me
by moving to Japan.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.691
Which I feel is overkill, if I'm honest.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.112
Go to the next town, I won't follow you.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.030
I'm very lazy.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.908
You come anywhere outside my immediate
area code, I'm off the pill.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.201
That's the deal with me.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.287
He went to Japan and it broke my heart.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.831
As soon as I was rejected, I thought,

23:35.914 --> 23:38.250
"Oh, I've really missed out
on this amazing man."

23:38.333 --> 23:40.460
And I was crying in my room,
and Violet found me.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.796
She said, "Oh, Mummy, don't be upset.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.006
That boy was a nuisance."

23:47.175 --> 23:49.845
And I had to Google "nuisance."
She's very fancy.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.391
She went to a far better school
than I went to.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.560
I'm from a part of Canada
that's, like, awful.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.520
-It's called Sarnia. Do you know it?
- Whoo!

23:58.603 --> 23:59.604
No. Um...

24:02.983 --> 24:06.319
There are two people
who are known to have left Sarnia.

24:06.403 --> 24:10.657
There's me and then heroic
Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.993
Everyone loves Chris Hatfield.

24:13.076 --> 24:15.162
He has millions of Twitter followers.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.623
They named an asteroid,
two schools and an airport after him.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.917
And I got a letter from the town council,

24:21.001 --> 24:22.752
asking me to stop saying
I was from Sarnia.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.421
That's the difference between us.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.549
I just think Chris Hadfield
is a rubbish celebrity.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.760
He's just a really nice guy,
just an astronaut, just some space fucker.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.137
Who cares about him?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.891
"Oh, Katherine, are you being too hard
on your local hero?"

24:35.974 --> 24:37.684
No, he's got a mustache.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.853
You can't be a celebrity with a mustache.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.939
It just looks like they fired
a substitute teacher into space.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.112
Far more interesting people
from my hometown.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.572
How about my friend Elizabeth?

24:50.655 --> 24:53.658
She overdosed on fentanyl 16 times.

24:56.286 --> 24:59.206
Still alive, still doing fentanyl.

25:00.916 --> 25:01.875
What a hero.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.504
Or my other friend Mandy Kay.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.964
She jerked off three hockey players
in the space of an hour,

25:08.048 --> 25:09.716
and they went on to win the game.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.595
Where's her airport?

25:17.807 --> 25:20.435
Life's just not fair sometimes.
Um...

25:22.270 --> 25:24.481
And so, um... he moved to Japan,

25:24.856 --> 25:27.984
and Violet said,
"Don't worry, Mummy. He's a nuisance."

25:28.401 --> 25:31.655
And then after about a week and a half,
he called me and he said,

25:31.738 --> 25:34.533
"Oh, you didn't come."
I said, "Pardon me?"

25:34.616 --> 25:36.618
He said, "I just figured you would come."

25:36.701 --> 25:39.454
I was like, "Where'd that apathy get you
in our sex life?

25:40.163 --> 25:42.457
"Why now what I spontaneously come?"

25:43.833 --> 25:46.169
He goes, "No, no, no,
I figured that you would realize

25:46.253 --> 25:47.879
how much you needed me

25:47.963 --> 25:50.799
and you would follow me to Japan."

25:51.633 --> 25:53.176
I was like, "You what?

25:54.177 --> 25:57.055
You thought... You thought
that I was gonna sell the dogs,

25:57.138 --> 25:58.723
pull my daughter out of school,

25:58.807 --> 26:00.183
quit my little job,

26:00.267 --> 26:02.060
move across the world,

26:02.143 --> 26:05.981
place myself directly in the flight path
of a North Korean missile...

26:08.024 --> 26:10.569
just to suck your dick in Japan?"

26:12.404 --> 26:14.739
He said,
"Well, I guess if you won't follow me,

26:15.240 --> 26:17.826
that just goes to show
that you don't need me."

26:17.909 --> 26:20.370
I said, "You're just learning that? No.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.164
No, I don't need you, I liked you.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.458
I chose to have you around
because you're a laugh.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.794
I enjoy your company,
but you are a luxury item."

26:29.004 --> 26:32.340
And he said, "Well I need to be
with someone who makes me a priority.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.301
And I suppose because you have a child,

26:34.384 --> 26:38.388
I will never be your first priority,
I shall always be second."

26:38.471 --> 26:41.349
And I was like, "Hah! Second? Oh.

26:43.476 --> 26:44.769
No."

26:50.442 --> 26:52.777
And by the way, I paid for everything.

26:53.236 --> 26:56.031
I was like,
"It literally says priority on your bags

26:56.114 --> 26:58.158
every time I buy you a plane ticket.

26:58.575 --> 27:02.579
And I always check back into economy
to see how you're doing on the flight."

27:04.539 --> 27:07.042
What more could I possibly have done
for this man?

27:07.125 --> 27:09.085
He said, "I must go where I am needed."

27:09.169 --> 27:11.171
Okay, Batman, off you fuck.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.842
Can you imagine, if I followed, just me,

27:15.925 --> 27:17.969
the biggest, whitest woman in Japan.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.304
Just like... "Raaar!

27:19.387 --> 27:22.474
Give me back my boyfriend
or I shall destroy Tokyo!

27:22.557 --> 27:23.933
Where is he?"

27:28.730 --> 27:30.440
Would someone like me go to Japan?

27:31.149 --> 27:32.776
- No.
-No. I went to Japan.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.277
Of course I went to Japan.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.862
I went to Japan!

27:35.945 --> 27:37.364
I missed him so much.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.282
And I left my daughter at her dad's.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.868
I was like, "I'll be right back,"
and I flew all the way to Japan.

27:41.951 --> 27:45.538
I was in such a rush, I fell
in the airport and broke my front tooth.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.500
- Aww.
-Yeah, one of the best teeth.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.921
I was at the lowest point of my life
and he was very sweet.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.382
He collected me from the airport,
I didn't speak the language.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.675
He took me to his apartment.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.803
He said, "Don't worry.
We'll get your tooth sorted, it's fine."

27:59.886 --> 28:02.722
And I thought,
"Wow, I was right to chase this man.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.391
I do need him."

28:04.474 --> 28:06.351
I rang my mother
and I told her the good news.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.728
I said, "Mom, I'm gonna sell the dogs,

28:08.812 --> 28:10.188
pull my daughter out of school,

28:10.271 --> 28:13.024
move across the world
and live with this man in Japan."

28:13.108 --> 28:14.025
And she said...

28:14.901 --> 28:17.153
"Let me get this straight."

28:17.529 --> 28:20.699
You're financially dependent
on a man in a foreign country

28:20.782 --> 28:22.492
and you got no fuckin' teeth?"

28:29.499 --> 28:31.584
She's a very clever whore, indeed.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.423
So I came home. But I will be honest,

28:36.506 --> 28:39.384
I'm not bulletproof,
it did hurt my feelings.

28:39.759 --> 28:43.763
And my friends gathered round me,
like friends do in times of grief.

28:43.847 --> 28:49.018
And they were like, "Girl, you need
to get yourself a revenge body, girl."

28:49.102 --> 28:50.437
I was like, "A what?"

28:50.520 --> 28:51.980
They said, "A revenge body."

28:52.063 --> 28:54.482
"Unless it's his body
in the back of my truck, I don't follow."

28:56.359 --> 28:57.569
And I know you don't follow.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.488
You're like, "Katherine, why are all
your friends offensive stereotypes

29:00.572 --> 29:01.906
of American black women?"

29:03.783 --> 29:06.953
They're not. They're gay British men.
It's the same voice.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.622
It's the exact same voice.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.711
"Well, ah ah ah, h'auntie,
this will not do.

29:15.628 --> 29:18.590
You need to get yourself a revenge body,
okurrrt?"

29:18.673 --> 29:20.300
And I didn't know what it was.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.264
And so I looked it up,
I found out revenge body,

29:26.347 --> 29:28.933
it's a term coined by Khloé Kardashian,

29:29.017 --> 29:32.270
one of my top five
favorite Kardashians, guys.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.232
Do you enjoy the family?
Do you like the Kardashians?

29:36.316 --> 29:37.692
- No.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.612
Some do, some don't.
Oh, very divisive, aren't they?

29:40.695 --> 29:43.281
Look, Joseph, just ratting out
your girlfriend straight away.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.908
She loves them. So do I.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.659
Give me a cheer if you like
the Kardashians.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.538
Many people. Give me a cheer
if you dislike the Kardashians.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.543
A lot more.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.629
How do you feel about them?

29:58.338 --> 30:00.507
- I'm indifferent. They're cool.
-Just indifferent?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.175
- Yeah. They do their thing.
-Yeah.

30:02.258 --> 30:06.054
Okay, well, apathy is a better attitude
than pure hatred based on nothing.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.306
-What's your name?
-Jay.

30:08.389 --> 30:09.933
Jay, do you watch the show?

30:10.016 --> 30:12.018
-Uh, I've seen an episode.
-And what did you think?

30:12.101 --> 30:13.728
Just apathy or were you motivated...

30:14.270 --> 30:15.396
They make a good show.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.857
Yeah, exactly, Joe, they make a good show.

30:18.107 --> 30:21.236
That's why I watch it, very tasteful
interiors. I find it relaxing.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.031
Okay, who dislikes the Kardashians?

30:26.032 --> 30:27.242
-You dislike them.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.618
No, madam, you don't like them.

30:28.701 --> 30:29.994
-What's your name?
- April.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.913
April, why do you hate the Kardashians?

30:31.996 --> 30:35.083
- They just don't do anything.
-They don't do anything?

30:35.917 --> 30:38.419
They do things 24 hours a day.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.006
They're doing things all the time.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.509
You need to follow them on Instagram,
and you shall see.

30:46.135 --> 30:49.055
Kim gets up at five a.m.,
straight in the gym.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.723
She eats oatmeal and egg whites.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.643
She's, like, basically an athlete.
She does that for you.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.899
They have lots of painful procedures,
they're doing all these businesses.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.818
Joe and I, we watch the show.

31:01.901 --> 31:05.363
The Kardashians have Trojan horsed
a lot of important issues

31:05.446 --> 31:07.574
into what looks like a vapid reality show.

31:07.657 --> 31:09.993
They had an episode
on the importance of Planned Parenthood.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.328
An episode on gun control.
I love the Kardashians.

31:12.412 --> 31:15.290
For me, they are a matriarchy
of shape-shifting sisters

31:15.373 --> 31:17.208
who destroy men or turn them to women,

31:17.292 --> 31:18.418
and for that...

31:25.133 --> 31:27.760
It's very much a sci-fi program.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.723
All they had to do was be Rob.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.766
That is all that was expected of them.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.061
And these women rise up.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.022
They're absolutely amazing.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.648
They have beautiful children.

31:41.107 --> 31:43.735
And all their children
somehow look like them,

31:43.818 --> 31:46.946
even though they themselves
don't look like them.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.534
And I will say they're not perfect,

31:51.618 --> 31:53.828
but they are thriving
in a capitalist society

31:53.912 --> 31:55.413
that they did not design.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.373
And for me, they're very vulnerable.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.666
They share everything.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.002
And when I was heartbroken
during my breakup,

32:01.085 --> 32:03.129
Khloé was also going through a breakup

32:03.212 --> 32:06.007
with her then husband,
NBA star Lamar Odom.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.384
Now, he had drug dependency issues.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.803
Anyone who's been touched by that
knows he lost everything.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.723
He lost his job and his fame and his wife.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.893
And he lost way more weight
than she did, by the way, but...

32:17.894 --> 32:21.272
But she didn't cry in her room
like I cried in my room.

32:21.356 --> 32:25.026
Khloé got in the gym and she started
working out, lifting weights.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.236
I thought, "What?
Here we go, revenge body.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.197
She's gonna bulk up,
be drafted by the NBA,

32:29.280 --> 32:30.615
beat him at his own game."

32:36.871 --> 32:38.539
That's not what happened, though.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.793
Uh, she just got a little bit smaller.

32:44.003 --> 32:47.382
Aw, man, that's the best you can do
when a man tells you to go away?

32:47.465 --> 32:50.426
Just, like, seven pounds of you goes away.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.932
Men don't do it the same way,
and we've really gotta stop.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.519
Show me a revenge film,
<i>Taken,</i> starring Liam Neeson.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.646
That's a good movie.
Where is the scene, though?

33:01.729 --> 33:05.817
When he's on the phone, like,
"I have a very specific set of skills.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.569
You let my daughter go
and that will be the end of it.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.405
But if you don't...

33:10.488 --> 33:13.616
then, like, Bible,
I will lose ten pounds."

33:14.701 --> 33:18.830
Yeah, I will appear on the cover
of <i>Complex</i> magazine<i> </i>in my underpants."

33:18.913 --> 33:22.625
And the captors are like, "What? Oh, no,
we never hear such terrible revenge.

33:22.709 --> 33:23.835
Please! Please!

33:24.585 --> 33:26.754
Please, just kill us, no!"

33:28.589 --> 33:30.341
It's never gonna happen.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.635
When my boyfriend left,
I gained ten pounds,

33:32.719 --> 33:34.846
perspective, a house
and a Netflix special.

33:34.929 --> 33:37.390
Just eat some chicken wings,
just eat something.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.599
They don't care.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.439
You can be small if you wanna be small.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.107
All of your bodies are very beautiful.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.985
But it's troubling when there's only
one type of body that we see.

33:49.485 --> 33:51.946
Meghan Markle, I'm supposed to like her,

33:52.030 --> 33:56.117
even though she took the only viable
ginger cock off the market, and that...

33:57.618 --> 33:59.370
that cut me very deep.

34:00.329 --> 34:02.665
That is the white tiger of the dick world.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.795
She saw his rare gemstone penis

34:07.879 --> 34:10.214
and captured it like a horny Lara Croft.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.764
And what's going on?
Why is she so small?

34:17.847 --> 34:19.474
Is there not a kitchen in the palace?

34:19.557 --> 34:21.142
These girls, they're all just so little.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.227
Have you been in a room
with Meghan Markle? I have.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.688
If she was born in the winter,
she wouldn't have made it.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.939
She's this big.

34:29.817 --> 34:33.529
What's the point of even being rich
if you can't have Taco Bell every day?

34:36.449 --> 34:39.118
When she and Kate Middleton
go out on disaster relief,

34:39.202 --> 34:41.370
you can't tell
who needs the malaria shots.

34:43.664 --> 34:47.210
I'm very happy that there's
mixed ethnicity in the royal family.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.461
It's groundbreaking.

34:48.544 --> 34:52.256
But wouldn't it also be groundbreaking
to have a duchess over 92 pounds?

34:52.340 --> 34:54.467
Like, "What? Feed these women!"

34:58.471 --> 35:00.139
Do we have any single mothers in?

35:01.808 --> 35:02.975
None. Good.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.020
They're at home where they belong.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.026
No single mothers? None?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.986
-Anyone considering it? Oh, one.
- Whoo!

35:14.862 --> 35:16.614
Just one single mom, then?

35:17.406 --> 35:18.908
You're just gonna lead her out, see...

35:18.991 --> 35:21.077
"We'll see how this goes for her,
and then..."

35:21.869 --> 35:23.538
No, you're fine. Okay. What's your name?

35:24.247 --> 35:25.498
Michelle and Dawn.

35:25.581 --> 35:27.458
-Michelle...
- And Dawn.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.085
-And Don.
- Yes.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.837
Seems less single than before.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.716
She hasn't realized she doesn't
have to say his name anymore.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.468
Its just... You can just be Michelle.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.636
Don's gone.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.893
So, there are two single mothers,
you've arrived together,

35:45.977 --> 35:47.937
one of you is Dawn
and one of you is Michelle?

35:48.020 --> 35:50.273
- Yes.
-Okay, and you are speaking for the group?

35:52.859 --> 35:55.319
You see how organized
a single mother has to be?

35:56.320 --> 35:59.407
She's like, "Dawn, you be quiet.
As ever, I'm the spokeswoman.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.371
You saw what happened when you tried
to get us those free drinks earlier.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.167
Let me deal with it, Dawn."

36:10.960 --> 36:13.254
Dawn, are you in an abusive friendship?

36:16.340 --> 36:17.758
Welcome, Michelle and Dawn.

36:17.842 --> 36:21.012
May I ask, how long has each of you
been a single mother for?

36:21.971 --> 36:23.639
Oh, wow. 2009.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.349
2009?

36:25.766 --> 36:26.976
Same! Um...

36:27.059 --> 36:30.730
Both-- Both of you together decided
in 2009, "This is gonna be our year"?

36:33.608 --> 36:39.238
And you were just coincidentally friends?
Or this was an organized...

36:40.531 --> 36:42.158
-departure?
- Our kids are friends.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.202
Your children are friends.
See, that's the thing.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.162
That's why Jane's on my dick all the time.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.791
Okay, your children are friends,
and you're friends,

36:50.875 --> 36:52.251
and you're both single mothers,

36:52.335 --> 36:54.420
out on the town,
enjoying a night of comedy.

36:54.795 --> 36:58.216
Welcome. Um, are you dating,
are you feeling it out,

36:58.299 --> 37:00.384
or just concentrating on your lives?

37:01.761 --> 37:03.054
- Yes.
-Yes.

37:05.556 --> 37:08.142
You just don't want
to be outed on Netflix.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.480
You'll be like, "I'm on Tinder right now."

37:13.981 --> 37:17.318
Okay, may I ask you,
do you enjoy being single mothers?

37:17.401 --> 37:18.486
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.656
You both do. Straightaway.
No one ever says no. They're like, "Yep."

37:23.199 --> 37:26.118
Do you feel that there's stigma attached
to being a single mom?

37:26.202 --> 37:27.536
- Definitely.
-Yeah, why?

37:27.620 --> 37:30.831
Why are these Janes like
"Just get back in a relationship."

37:30.915 --> 37:32.041
"No!"

37:32.124 --> 37:34.877
Okay. Um, this is the thing, ladies.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.463
I feel, if you are unsure
about your choices

37:37.546 --> 37:40.633
ask yourself, "Would I be more celebrated

37:40.716 --> 37:42.969
if I were doing this as a man?"

37:43.511 --> 37:45.930
And if I were a man, if you were men,

37:46.013 --> 37:48.391
we wouldn't be, "Single, oh, no."

37:48.474 --> 37:51.394
We'd be eligible as fuck.

37:52.728 --> 37:53.771
You can sit down, ladies.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.315
-Thank you so much. Um...

37:57.525 --> 37:58.651
Thank you.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.572
I just bought a house in central London.

38:03.656 --> 38:06.492
They would have made me
the Bachelor two years ago.

38:07.076 --> 38:10.288
Like, "Oh, my God, how does he do it?

38:10.371 --> 38:12.999
How does a young, young,

38:13.082 --> 38:15.418
young, young,

38:16.002 --> 38:18.921
young, young, young, young
baby boy of a man...

38:20.589 --> 38:23.592
How does he raise a gorgeous
young daughter without financial help

38:23.676 --> 38:25.052
from anywhere?"

38:25.136 --> 38:27.972
And there'd be memes of me
just vacuuming with no shirt on.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.640
No one knows why, just...

38:32.101 --> 38:33.602
"How does he do it?"

38:33.686 --> 38:36.439
"I don't know.
I just push it back and forth. Uhh..."

38:39.400 --> 38:41.569
There would be YouTube videos
going viral.

38:41.652 --> 38:44.322
Have you seen these?
40 million views.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.741
"Oh! Incredible dad

38:46.824 --> 38:50.494
learns to braid his own child's hair!

38:52.621 --> 38:54.749
How does he do it?"

38:56.042 --> 38:57.668
And I'd be very smug.

38:57.752 --> 39:01.005
I'd be like,
"Well, if you think my hands are full

39:01.088 --> 39:02.757
you should see my heart.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.091
Uhhnngh!"

39:07.219 --> 39:12.141
I would say,
"I take three equal sections of hair.

39:13.309 --> 39:18.105
And then, heroically, I fold one
into the other two, and so on."

39:18.189 --> 39:21.275
Like any idiot could do.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.697
And women all over the globe
would lose their shit.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.366
They'd be like, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:28.449 --> 39:31.118
Michelle, Dawn, get over here!
Have you heard about...

39:32.286 --> 39:34.288
this incredible single dad?

39:34.372 --> 39:37.958
Where is he?
Is anyone sucking him off right now, here?

39:38.751 --> 39:40.961
Can I go next?"

39:41.045 --> 39:43.881
They'd form a very long line,
and then I would remove the mask

39:43.964 --> 39:46.092
and be like, "Ha ha. I am a lady."

39:49.178 --> 39:51.931
And those same women
would be like, "Ew, gross.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.474
Another single mom.

39:55.142 --> 39:58.521
She should have worked harder
to keep her family together."

39:59.480 --> 40:02.817
<i>♪ He left because I asked him to ♪</i>

40:10.866 --> 40:13.285
<i>♪ I asked him more than once</i>
<i>La-la-la, la-la-la ♪</i>

40:15.287 --> 40:18.290
People always say,
"How are you single? I don't understand.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.960
There are men. You could get one."

40:21.419 --> 40:22.378
I know.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.380
Um...

40:25.131 --> 40:28.551
Still, still,
boys are taught to become somebody,

40:28.634 --> 40:30.678
girls are taught to find somebody.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.973
I have chosen to do neither
of those dog shit things.

40:36.058 --> 40:39.061
And I still go on dates,
but with my girlfriends.

40:39.145 --> 40:41.730
I recently accompanied
my single girlfriend Emma

40:41.814 --> 40:43.482
to her aunt's funeral.

40:44.817 --> 40:45.651
And...

40:46.360 --> 40:50.072
It was a beautiful day, and her aunt
was such an inspiring woman.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.324
She lived to be 95 years old,

40:52.408 --> 40:56.412
she escaped the Nazis,
and started an incredible business.

40:56.495 --> 40:59.331
And as we saw her off,
a man next to us said,

40:59.415 --> 41:01.417
"Oh, so sad.

41:01.500 --> 41:05.379
95 years old
and never able to find a man."

41:06.630 --> 41:10.092
I was like,
"How do you think she lived so long?"

41:16.307 --> 41:18.684
<i>♪ Get your breath away from me</i> ♪

41:22.480 --> 41:25.858
My daughter and I are, uh...
very dissimilar,

41:25.941 --> 41:26.817
and that's okay.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.570
She came home from school
the other day, and she said to me,

41:29.653 --> 41:32.490
"Mummy, do you know what's happening
in my country?"

41:32.573 --> 41:35.534
Which is an ominous way
to start any sentence nowadays.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.331
I said, "What, Violet?
What's happening in your country?"

41:40.414 --> 41:41.749
And she says, "Well, Mummy,

41:41.832 --> 41:44.168
there are people coming into the country,

41:44.251 --> 41:46.587
and they're using all the stuff
and taking all the jobs,

41:46.670 --> 41:48.714
and soon there's going to be
nothing left for me."

41:48.797 --> 41:51.592
I was like...
"I've raised a deplorable."

41:54.053 --> 41:55.012
Sad.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.430
Um...

41:59.350 --> 42:02.811
And she's very innocent. We have
the same problems all over the world.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.480
The political climate is very similar.

42:04.563 --> 42:08.067
I think sometimes we surround ourselves
with too many like-minded people.

42:08.150 --> 42:11.028
My viewpoint is just a different one
to yours sometimes,

42:11.111 --> 42:12.696
and hers is a different one to mine.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.990
I think that's very healthy
for discussion.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.743
The trouble is the irony.
I had to say to her, "Violet.

42:17.826 --> 42:21.664
"Uh, you know, the people that you're
worried about coming into the country?"

42:21.747 --> 42:23.207
She says, "Yes, Mummy?"

42:23.290 --> 42:25.251
I said, "'Do you know that that's you?"

42:26.126 --> 42:29.630
She says, "No it's not, Mummy.
I'm 100 percent British."

42:29.713 --> 42:31.590
I was like, "You're 100 percent not.

42:33.217 --> 42:37.471
You were born here,
but I came from another country.

42:37.555 --> 42:41.183
Maybe you didn't notice
'cause I'm white, and..."

42:42.643 --> 42:43.602
I...

42:46.063 --> 42:48.148
We're very sneaky. I...

42:48.691 --> 42:51.068
started working straight away,
I had nothing.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.445
I worked and I worked harder
and I paid tax and I worked.

42:53.529 --> 42:56.574
And I didn't even use
our public health service in England

42:56.657 --> 43:00.077
until the day I delivered her
in the hospital.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.246
And she says, "Well, yes, Mummy, me.

43:02.329 --> 43:04.582
And I'm entitled to those things
because I'm British."

43:04.665 --> 43:07.543
I was like, "Oh! And if you're worried
about jobs, by the way,

43:07.626 --> 43:09.753
plenty of jobs to do around here.

43:09.837 --> 43:13.090
Start with the washing up, maybe clean
your fucking room every once in a while.

43:14.967 --> 43:19.221
I promise, I'm only doing the jobs
that you won't do."

43:20.306 --> 43:24.226
Sometimes I feel like a foreign nanny
who's given birth to my mean British boss.

43:25.728 --> 43:27.813
And so I took her for a genetic test,

43:27.896 --> 43:30.149
which is a fun thing to do
with any racist.

43:30.232 --> 43:31.275
Have you been?

43:34.153 --> 43:35.738
Have you been?

43:35.821 --> 43:38.115
You must do it to see their little faces

43:38.198 --> 43:41.452
when they find out they're Nigerian
and have to quit their club.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.247
'Cause no one's 100 percent anything.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.875
It would be very bad for you
if you were 100 percent anything.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.294
Your ancestors moved all around the earth

43:50.377 --> 43:53.505
and collected the strongest stuff
from all over, and that's why you're here.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.216
Has anyone taken one of these tests
where you spit in a tube?

43:56.300 --> 43:58.135
You have. Oh, both of you have. Hello.

43:58.218 --> 43:59.762
-What's your name?
- Savvy.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.472
Savvy, cool. Oh, my gosh.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.432
Already we know it's gonna be spicy.

44:05.726 --> 44:06.894
Okay, Savvy,

44:06.977 --> 44:10.689
um, before you took the genetic test,
what did you think your ancestry was?

44:10.773 --> 44:13.692
- I thought I was really Russian.
-Really Russian? Not just Russian?

44:13.776 --> 44:15.569
-Like--
-Really Russian?

44:15.819 --> 44:18.072
- Almost full.
-Almost full.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.949
- And the other part German.
-Cool. Russian and German.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.285
-Then what did it turn out  that you were?
-Really British.

44:23.369 --> 44:26.163
Really, erm... Scandinavian.

44:26.246 --> 44:28.207
Do you remember the percentages
of the really?

44:28.290 --> 44:29.667
Uh, 33.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.085
-33?
-Yeah.

44:31.168 --> 44:33.128
-Oh, 33 is really, really high.
-Yeah.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.881
-Most people aren't 33. Okay.
-Almost all three of them.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.550
-And did it change your life in any way?
- No.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.761
No, you were like, "Still white."

44:44.181 --> 44:47.685
Poor Savvy. She was hoping she could
start singing Cardi B on public transport.

44:47.768 --> 44:48.894
No.

44:49.436 --> 44:50.562
No.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.359
I was hoping for that as well.

44:55.734 --> 44:58.195
But I took the test.
Well, Violet took the test first.

44:58.278 --> 45:01.365
She's also 30% British, like you.
That's high. She was pleased with that.

45:01.448 --> 45:04.034
I took the test,
and they asked me to take it again.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.787
And I was like, "Uh-oh."

45:06.870 --> 45:09.581
I took it again
and they said, "We're sorry,

45:09.665 --> 45:12.668
you are 96 percent Irish,

45:13.335 --> 45:15.462
which is entirely too high."

45:22.010 --> 45:23.887
I know I'm Irish. My dad's Irish.

45:23.971 --> 45:26.181
We visited all the time as a kid.
It's a big clue.

45:26.265 --> 45:27.850
But 96?

45:27.933 --> 45:31.395
They were looking at me, like,
"How did she get dressed today?"

45:34.148 --> 45:35.524
96!

45:35.607 --> 45:38.861
Like, that means my ancestors
never swallowed on holiday.

45:38.944 --> 45:40.195
Never.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.490
Even got in a-- Just nothing. Nothing!

45:43.574 --> 45:47.745
These lazy women just fucked in a circle
in one village in Ireland. Just...

45:47.828 --> 45:50.998
Cousin, cousin, cousin, cousin...

45:51.081 --> 45:54.084
for thousands and thousands of years.

45:56.336 --> 46:00.883
Trust me, no matter what anyone tells you,
that is not what you want.

46:01.300 --> 46:05.763
And I know that right now, minorities feel
really displaced and disrespected.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.347
I face a very different threat.

46:07.431 --> 46:09.391
If this gets out, I could be farmed

46:09.475 --> 46:11.852
into a sexual breeding program
by the alt-right.

46:13.729 --> 46:17.483
They'll be like, "Oh, great news, we found
a really, really, really white one.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.442
Come on!

46:19.735 --> 46:24.990
Hurry, hurry! She's running out of time
to have another baby! Everyone!"

46:25.783 --> 46:27.618
Just have to suck their old balls.

46:28.494 --> 46:31.121
This is why I get excited
about becoming an older woman.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.915
That will be liberty in many ways.

46:32.998 --> 46:35.417
That's when I will finally be released
into a field and shot.

46:35.501 --> 46:36.543
I can't wait.

46:38.253 --> 46:40.172
I absolutely can't wait.

46:40.255 --> 46:44.635
Too many things are about finding a man,
tricking a man, getting a man.

46:44.718 --> 46:47.471
I have been told,
"Oh, Katherine, what are you wearing?

46:47.554 --> 46:51.391
This elaborate fashion
will be very confusing to a man."

46:51.475 --> 46:52.518
Is it?

46:52.601 --> 46:56.063
I did not come dressed as the laws
of cricket. What you talking about?

46:57.731 --> 47:00.067
"Just simple silhouettes,
Katherine, simple silhouettes."

47:00.150 --> 47:01.193
Even my nails.

47:01.276 --> 47:05.239
"Katherine, the only acceptable nail color
is ballet slipper.

47:05.322 --> 47:08.617
This color of nails
will be very confusing to a man."

47:09.451 --> 47:10.953
Some of you are glad I brought it up.

47:11.036 --> 47:14.331
You were like, "She has two tennis rackets
holding a microphone."

47:14.414 --> 47:16.416
These are hands. I know it's confusing.

47:17.793 --> 47:19.920
Jane Fonda tweeted a photo

47:20.003 --> 47:22.256
after an awards, where in the morning,

47:22.339 --> 47:25.884
she was still wearing the gown
that she'd been in the night before.

47:26.510 --> 47:29.137
Because women get trapped in our clothes.

47:29.221 --> 47:31.223
That is how society is designed

47:31.306 --> 47:34.059
to make sure we land a man.

47:34.142 --> 47:36.937
And she stood there in a gown,
making eggs at nine a.m.,

47:37.020 --> 47:39.940
and said, "Sometimes I do wish
I had a husband."

47:40.399 --> 47:42.609
Women's fashions are a beautiful prison.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.363
If Houdini wore Vivienne Westwood,
he would have drowned every time.

47:52.077 --> 47:53.662
He was waiting for a Houdini joke.

47:53.745 --> 47:55.080
He just was waiting...

47:55.747 --> 47:56.957
He was like, "Finally.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.335
Finally, she's mentioning something edgy.

48:01.795 --> 48:02.921
Like Houdini."

48:04.798 --> 48:08.218
Times have changed. I'm glad. I'm peaceful
and positive that they're still changing.

48:08.302 --> 48:11.597
My grandmother would not
have been allowed to buy a house,

48:11.680 --> 48:13.765
carry a passport, or open a bank account

48:13.849 --> 48:15.767
without the signature of a man.

48:16.101 --> 48:17.769
And so, when I bought our house...

48:17.853 --> 48:20.689
By house, I mean home.
By home, I mean flat.

48:20.772 --> 48:22.441
It's very small, it's in London.

48:22.691 --> 48:24.860
It was such a momentous occasion.

48:24.943 --> 48:27.988
I didn't think I'd ever be able to have
that security with my child

48:28.071 --> 48:29.531
as a single mother.

48:29.615 --> 48:32.618
And I invited my family to see it,
and they're from Canada.

48:32.701 --> 48:33.994
And they arrived and they said,

48:34.077 --> 48:36.914
"But, Katherine, it is so small.

48:37.831 --> 48:41.001
This is the hoose
that you bought with all your money?

48:47.633 --> 48:52.220
Don't you know what size hoose you could
afford in your hometown for this money?"

48:52.638 --> 48:54.890
"Yeah, but what room
would I kill myself in?

48:54.973 --> 48:56.391
Stop talking."

48:58.936 --> 49:01.647
"Why don't you talk like your family
anymore, Katherine?

49:01.730 --> 49:03.607
Are you too good for your family?"

49:03.690 --> 49:07.027
"Do the words <i>Celebrity Storage</i>
<i>Hunters </i>mean anything to you?"

49:08.445 --> 49:11.323
Yes, I'm too good for my family.
I'm very British now.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.158
Um... My daughter is too good for me.

49:13.241 --> 49:15.285
She is fancy. This is a fancy child.

49:15.369 --> 49:18.372
We were on holiday, and she wanted
to get out of the swimming pool.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.998
I was on the side with my sister.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.376
And I don't even know
what she's saying half the time.

49:22.459 --> 49:26.088
She called out, "Mummy, prepare my towel."

49:32.260 --> 49:34.721
Means, "I'm ready
to get out of the water."

49:35.555 --> 49:37.683
I was like, "How do you prepare a towel?"

49:38.725 --> 49:41.853
My sister Joanne's like,
"What's a towel?" I don't know.

49:43.063 --> 49:45.524
I don't know. In my day,
we didn't have towels.

49:45.607 --> 49:47.651
You just shook yourself dry in the yard.

49:49.695 --> 49:51.029
"Get out."

49:52.197 --> 49:54.157
I was so proud of the flat.

49:54.241 --> 49:57.494
And it's an old
gothic church conversion in England.

49:57.577 --> 50:01.123
We had to redo the whole thing 'cause
it was falling apart. They love old shit.

50:01.206 --> 50:03.709
And I, uh... I chose, with my daughter,

50:03.792 --> 50:06.253
as a very healing, soothing ritual,

50:06.336 --> 50:08.296
a space that was just ours.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.674
Taking up space is very important.

50:10.757 --> 50:12.592
We chose florals on florals,

50:12.676 --> 50:14.428
dark Scandinavian florals,

50:14.511 --> 50:16.722
rose gold brushed copper blush.

50:16.805 --> 50:19.057
And I found a builder,
and I showed him my plans,

50:19.141 --> 50:21.184
and in my house, he said,

50:21.643 --> 50:24.271
"No, you cannot do this.

50:24.354 --> 50:28.650
If you do this,
no man will want to live here."

50:29.276 --> 50:30.569
I was like... "Eh-heh.

50:30.652 --> 50:32.654
Do you promise? Get it on the wall."

50:37.909 --> 50:40.746
The more he pushed against me,
the harder I pushed back.

50:40.829 --> 50:45.208
He was like, "I don't think <i>Golden Girls</i>
tile mosaic is good idea for toilets."

50:48.170 --> 50:49.588
"Get it on the wall."

50:51.256 --> 50:53.300
And Violet's room is the glitter room.

50:53.383 --> 50:55.052
And he didn't even want to call it that.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.138
I mean, she wanted glitter carpet,
glitter wall, little glitter disco ball.

50:58.221 --> 50:59.514
When I showed him that, he said,

50:59.598 --> 51:02.142
"When will the decision maker be home?"

51:03.560 --> 51:06.271
I was like,
"She's at school for two more hours.

51:09.524 --> 51:12.944
So you better hurry up,
because that girl is mean to staff.

51:16.031 --> 51:18.950
She will call Home Office on us both."
Um...

51:19.993 --> 51:22.913
And he wouldn't call it the glitter room.
He was like, "The second bedroom."

51:22.996 --> 51:26.124
I was like, "No, I need you to say it."
He didn't wanna say it.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.709
And this is the thing.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.586
I don't dislike men.

51:29.669 --> 51:33.632
I dislike the toxic masculinity
that holds a lot of men back.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.467
Feminism is good for you.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.761
We want you to be earning money.
We want to earn money.

51:37.844 --> 51:40.055
We want everyone to be the same
so that you can relax

51:40.138 --> 51:41.890
and drink some day wine once in a while.

51:42.682 --> 51:44.559
We want you to be yourselves.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.686
This poor man was so repressed.

51:46.770 --> 51:49.022
I said, "Just say glitter room,
just say the word.

51:49.106 --> 51:52.192
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you."
And he was like... "Ahem. Ugh."

51:52.651 --> 51:54.861
"Glitter room."

51:54.945 --> 51:56.738
"Yeah, down the hall from where?"

51:56.822 --> 52:00.534
He's like, "The piano nook."
I was like, "Say it." He was like, "Ugh."

52:00.617 --> 52:03.286
"The Anna Kendrick Memorial Music Hall."

52:05.413 --> 52:06.289
Yes!

52:10.502 --> 52:13.421
And he had a little bit of a lightness
to his step all of a sudden.

52:13.505 --> 52:16.842
He's like, "I will be back on Wednesday."
I was like, "What do we do Wednesday?"

52:16.925 --> 52:19.636
He's all, "We wear pink on Wednesday."

52:23.056 --> 52:24.432
Yes!

52:24.516 --> 52:26.226
My gift to you, sir.

52:27.269 --> 52:30.188
Violet loves Anna Kendrick.
Do you like Anna Kendrick too?

52:30.272 --> 52:31.731
-Oh, my gosh.

52:31.815 --> 52:33.733
She's such a wonderful role model
for children.

52:33.817 --> 52:37.237
She's really funny online, she's a great
actress, great singer, multi-talented.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.655
Really spicy.

52:38.738 --> 52:42.075
And when Violet told me
that was her first celebrity crush,

52:42.159 --> 52:45.495
I was very happy to, like, take her
to all the movies and all the stuff.

52:45.579 --> 52:47.414
And then one day she says to me,
"Mummy, Mummy!

52:47.497 --> 52:49.249
Anna Kendrick's going to be in London.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.001
Please, can I meet Anna Kendrick?"

52:51.084 --> 52:52.460
And I was like, "No."

52:53.962 --> 52:55.589
She says, "Why not? You're on television."

52:55.672 --> 52:58.466
I was like, "Yeah, I can get you
in the audience of <i>Bake Off.</i>

52:58.550 --> 52:59.718
That's about it."

53:01.344 --> 53:03.346
She says,
"Please, will you just ask someone?"

53:03.430 --> 53:07.184
So I spoke to my manager, who as it turns
out, knows Anna Kendrick's manager.

53:07.267 --> 53:10.228
And he said, "Okay, I cannot
promise you a meeting,

53:10.312 --> 53:13.356
but I'll tell you where they're doing
the press day for the movie.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.026
If you go to the London hotel,
you might catch a glimpse of her.

53:16.109 --> 53:19.946
But if you do,
the child has to remain calm.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.949
They've been traveling a lot,
they don't want a fuss."

53:23.033 --> 53:25.702
I said, "Don't worry,
this child's very fancy."

53:26.453 --> 53:27.370
And so...

53:27.829 --> 53:31.499
we went to the hotel,
and I got us spy outfits,

53:31.583 --> 53:34.211
little spy hats,
little magnifying glasses.

53:34.294 --> 53:36.254
Oh, yeah, to stalk the woman.

53:37.839 --> 53:40.091
No, just because I knew
we probably weren't gonna meet her

53:40.175 --> 53:41.301
and I wanted to make it fun.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.553
If I'm running out of time to do anything,

53:43.637 --> 53:46.681
it's to hang out with my child
while she still thinks I'm cool.

53:46.765 --> 53:48.767
And we went down
to the dinner in the hotel,

53:48.850 --> 53:50.602
and we said,
"Oh, is Anna Kendrick at dinner?"

53:50.685 --> 53:52.687
She wasn't at dinner,
but we took lots of spy notes.

53:52.771 --> 53:55.523
"That lady has an American accent.
Maybe she knows Anna Kendrick.

53:55.607 --> 53:57.108
That man's eating fish and chips."

53:57.192 --> 54:01.029
We stayed up very late in the hotel bar.
Mummy had many, many night wines.

54:01.112 --> 54:02.322
Anna Kendrick...

54:03.448 --> 54:04.908
was not in the bar.

54:04.991 --> 54:06.660
And Violet fell into bed about midnight.

54:06.743 --> 54:08.787
Up straight again, six a.m.,
down for breakfast.

54:08.870 --> 54:11.748
Anna Kendrick wasn't at breakfast.
We have the spy outfits on again.

54:11.831 --> 54:14.167
And then we sat outside
where the press junket was happening,

54:14.251 --> 54:16.544
hoping we might catch a glimpse
of her on the way in.

54:16.628 --> 54:18.922
But they must've snuck around back.
We didn't see her.

54:19.005 --> 54:22.425
And I thought, "Oh, we had a really good
time anyway. This is character building.

54:22.509 --> 54:25.679
You know what, Violet?
You don't always get what you want."

54:25.762 --> 54:29.182
And then I heard the clickety-clack
of her heels

54:29.266 --> 54:31.768
coming down the hallway towards my child.

54:31.851 --> 54:34.729
And she looked her in the face
and said, "Hi.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.898
You must be Violet."

54:37.482 --> 54:40.026
And I burst into tears.
I was like, "Oh, my God!"

54:41.528 --> 54:44.698
Oh, my God, she loves you so much!
She loves you so much!

54:45.532 --> 54:47.367
Like, I'm really sorry
about the spy outfits.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.911
Like, it's just a joke. I'm so sorry!"

54:51.121 --> 54:54.124
Violet's like, "Oh, ignore my mummy.
She's Canadian. Er..."

54:58.920 --> 55:01.464
I totally lost it.
I was just so pleased for her.

55:01.548 --> 55:04.342
Anna Kendrick handled it well.
She was so polite, chatted to Violet.

55:04.426 --> 55:07.721
They took a photo which now hangs
in the glitter room. And...

55:07.804 --> 55:10.432
Afterwards, I got a stern telling off
from my manager.

55:10.515 --> 55:13.601
He was like, "Hey, Katherine,
what the fuck was that?" I was like...

55:15.061 --> 55:17.105
I did not know that I had those emotions.

55:18.231 --> 55:22.652
But I'd been traveling a lot, and, uh,
we were in LA only four days later.

55:22.736 --> 55:25.238
And Violet was with me,
and we went to a coffee shop.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.990
And into the coffee shop

55:27.073 --> 55:29.409
walks Anna fucking Kendrick.

55:31.161 --> 55:34.873
And I thought, "No! I can't be done
for international stalking."

55:37.584 --> 55:40.503
So as soon as I saw her,
I made my daughter face the wall.

55:41.129 --> 55:44.007
She says, "What's going on, Mummy?"
I said, "Anna Kendrick just walked in."

55:44.090 --> 55:47.344
She said, "Please, Mommy, please
can I say hello? I feel we had a rapport."

55:47.427 --> 55:49.554
I had to Google "rapport."  I'm like, "No.

55:51.598 --> 55:54.684
Nope. You're gonna face the wall
until she leaves."

55:55.018 --> 55:57.312
And so we're in the corner
of the coffee shop,

55:57.395 --> 55:59.981
and the barista comes over
with one of those little Frappuccinos

56:00.065 --> 56:01.649
you're not supposed to let them get,

56:01.733 --> 56:05.320
and he was like, "Violet? Violet? Violet?"

56:05.820 --> 56:07.447
We're still facing the wall.

56:09.115 --> 56:12.660
Until I could feel the entire coffee shop
looking at us,

56:12.744 --> 56:14.496
including Anna Kendrick.

56:14.579 --> 56:17.123
And I thought, "Well, I have a second
chance now to redeem myself,

56:17.207 --> 56:18.666
just play it cool, play it cool."

56:18.750 --> 56:22.379
And I spun around and I said,
"Anna Kendrick, we're not here for you."

56:22.462 --> 56:24.297
I took the drink and we left.

56:30.136 --> 56:33.598
Not Anna Kendrick,  as it turns out.
It was, uh... just...

56:35.850 --> 56:38.019
You know, I really love men.

56:38.103 --> 56:40.271
I think a lot of good men want to know

56:40.355 --> 56:42.190
how they can make things better
for everyone.

56:42.273 --> 56:44.984
And they ask me
why the women are so upset.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.111
They say, "Katherine, uh...

56:46.945 --> 56:49.656
fill me in, what's angering the dames?

56:51.991 --> 56:55.036
Why are the dames
so out of sorts these days?

56:56.079 --> 56:58.957
And-- And who can we even
hug at work anymore?"

57:00.708 --> 57:02.293
And the answer is no one.

57:03.670 --> 57:07.924
But if you do feel like, uh... making
a sexual advance to someone at work,

57:08.007 --> 57:09.843
make sure that it's your boss,

57:09.926 --> 57:12.137
or, at the very least, an equal.

57:12.220 --> 57:14.389
And definitely not the teenager

57:14.472 --> 57:16.391
whose job it is to bring you coffee.

57:16.724 --> 57:17.559
Uh...

57:17.642 --> 57:20.186
just stop fucking
vulnerable women, basically.

57:20.603 --> 57:22.564
Vulnerable. So, uh...

57:22.647 --> 57:25.692
if you are standing in the way
of her career progression,

57:25.775 --> 57:28.027
or, uh, she is a child,

57:28.111 --> 57:31.281
just vulnerable, any definition
of vulnerable, don't fuck those women.

57:31.698 --> 57:32.991
Oh, I know you want to.

57:33.074 --> 57:34.117
Do not.

57:35.994 --> 57:38.872
"Uh... What about my babysitter?"
No, do not...

57:39.414 --> 57:42.584
This seems like a simple thing,
but it became very clear to me

57:42.667 --> 57:45.712
at Christmas time
when I took myself out on a date

57:45.795 --> 57:47.672
to see the incredible musical <i>Hamilton.</i>

57:47.755 --> 57:48.631
Have you seen it?

57:50.300 --> 57:51.509
Oh, my goodness, it's so great.

57:51.593 --> 57:54.596
If you can't see the musical, download
the soundtrack and listen to the songs.

57:54.679 --> 57:56.931
It's such a beautiful story,
so beautifully told.

57:57.015 --> 57:59.851
My daughter was with her father
and I went all by myself,

57:59.934 --> 58:01.102
Christmas Eve to see <i>Hamilton.</i>

58:01.186 --> 58:03.855
I had not listened to the soundtrack.
I didn't know what it was about.

58:03.938 --> 58:06.983
And I went to a garbage school,
so I didn't know about American history.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.903
If you don't know
who Alexander Hamilton is,

58:09.986 --> 58:11.696
he's one of the founding fathers
of America.

58:11.779 --> 58:14.908
He created the justice system.
He wrote a lot of the Constitution.

58:14.991 --> 58:18.745
He was a senior officer and a general
in the American Revolutionary War.

58:18.828 --> 58:22.040
He made some incredible
evil political inroads...

58:23.041 --> 58:26.085
even though he was an orphan
and an immigrant.

58:26.169 --> 58:30.089
And a lot of that was because
he chose a powerful wife.

58:30.173 --> 58:33.968
His wife, Elizabeth Schuyler ,
was from a high-status family,

58:34.052 --> 58:38.306
and you needed that back then because
America was very classist and racist.

58:39.057 --> 58:42.101
It--It's difficult
to imagine it that way now....

58:44.103 --> 58:47.273
But transport yourselves back
to the 1700s...

58:47.941 --> 58:50.360
and that's very much the way that it was.

58:50.443 --> 58:51.861
And she was a great wife.

58:51.945 --> 58:54.906
Not only was she high status,
from a powerful family,

58:54.989 --> 58:57.325
she created the first orphanages
in America.

58:57.408 --> 59:01.037
She had so many of Hamilton's kids
that they named two of them Philip.

59:01.663 --> 59:03.122
That's a lot of kids.

59:04.457 --> 59:06.376
She was the Jane of her time.

59:09.587 --> 59:11.839
And then one day, she says, uh...

59:11.923 --> 59:13.424
"Hamilton, I love you.

59:13.508 --> 59:16.219
Let's take the children on holiday.
Come with us."

59:16.302 --> 59:18.846
And he's like, "No, I'm too important."

59:18.930 --> 59:22.600
And he sat alone in his house
for about five seconds,

59:22.684 --> 59:25.937
and in walks a very vulnerable, very young

59:26.020 --> 59:28.982
disheveled girl off the street,
and she's like...

59:29.065 --> 59:30.817
"Mmm!"

59:30.900 --> 59:33.486
<i>♪ I know that you are a man of honor</i> ♪

59:33.570 --> 59:35.780
<i>♪ I'm so sorry to bother you at home ♪</i>

59:35.863 --> 59:38.366
-♪ <i>But I don't know where to go ♪</i>

59:38.449 --> 59:41.411
<i>♪ And I came here all alone ♪</i>

59:41.494 --> 59:43.371
I'm like, "Oh, shit."

59:44.289 --> 59:45.123
She goes...

59:45.206 --> 59:47.208
<i>♪ My husband's doin' me wrong ♪</i>

59:47.292 --> 59:50.378
<i>♪ Beatin' me, cheatin' me</i>

<i>♪ Suddenly he's up and gone ♪</i>

59:53.214 --> 59:55.967
<i>♪ I don't have the means to go on ♪</i>

59:56.050 --> 59:58.845
By "means," he hears cock, somehow.

1:00:00.054 --> 1:00:03.099
And this powerful politician
starts licking his lips, and he's like,

1:00:03.182 --> 1:00:06.060
<i>♪ Lord, show me how to say no to this ♪</i>

1:00:06.144 --> 1:00:09.272
<i>♪ I don't know how to say no to this ♪</i>

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:13.860
And I rose from my seat...

1:00:14.902 --> 1:00:18.531
as though <i>Hamilton</i>
was a <i>Choose Your Own Adventure.</i>

1:00:22.118 --> 1:00:26.789
And I shouted<i> </i>at the actor
portraying Alexander Hamilton.

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:30.710
I said, "Say no to what?
She didn't ask you anything!"

1:00:35.798 --> 1:00:36.758
No.

1:00:37.383 --> 1:00:39.218
No, I had absolutely no support.

1:00:40.053 --> 1:00:42.722
They were a very quiet,
very shocked British audience.

1:00:43.556 --> 1:00:45.433
He was very professional, he carried on.

1:00:45.850 --> 1:00:48.645
<i>♪ Lord, show me how to say no to this</i> ♪

1:00:48.728 --> 1:00:51.230
<i>♪ I don't know how to say no to this ♪</i>

1:00:51.314 --> 1:00:54.734
I carried on. "You said no
to the British Empire though, didn't you?

1:00:55.068 --> 1:00:58.988
That was easy, but when a child asks you
no questions, what are you gonna say?"

1:01:00.823 --> 1:01:03.660
<i>♪ Lord, show me how to say no to this</i> ♪

1:01:03.743 --> 1:01:06.496
<i>♪ I don't know how to say no to this ♪</i>

1:01:06.829 --> 1:01:09.832
And then, he said the actual words.

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:13.086
<i>♪ But, by God, she looks so helpless ♪</i>

1:01:13.169 --> 1:01:15.797
<i>♪ And her body's sayin' hell, yes ♪</i>

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.006
I was like, "Oh!"

1:01:17.090 --> 1:01:20.593
<i>♪ Her body is not saying that to you ♪</i>

1:01:22.845 --> 1:01:26.140
"Her body is saying,
'Hey, local representative,

1:01:27.642 --> 1:01:31.396
I appear to have found myself
in a domestic abuse situation.

1:01:32.897 --> 1:01:36.150
But I'm not currently allowed
to vote or work or eat.'

1:01:36.234 --> 1:01:39.904
So why don't you put your fucking
dick away and help this lady?

1:01:41.072 --> 1:01:42.490
Help this lady!"

1:01:48.496 --> 1:01:49.622
Wrong, no.

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:53.251
That's not the reaction that the very
British audience had that Christmas Eve.

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.670
Not even when I tried
to get the chant going.

1:01:55.753 --> 1:01:57.130
Oh, I tried to get a chant going.

1:01:57.213 --> 1:02:00.550
Put your fuckin' dick away!
Put your fuckin' dick away!

1:02:00.633 --> 1:02:02.635
Put your fuckin' dick away!

1:02:02.927 --> 1:02:03.803
Nothin'.

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:09.016
So when I say I've seen <i>Hamilton...</i>

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:11.561
I've seen half of <i>Hamilton.</i>

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:17.483
It's fair enough. It's fair enough.
Uh, I don't know what went wrong.

1:02:18.151 --> 1:02:21.112
I mean, I do know what went wrong.
I'd been drinking day wine in the night.

1:02:21.195 --> 1:02:22.447
That's what went wrong.

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.241
You don't drink day wine in the night.

1:02:25.324 --> 1:02:27.493
It's for the day.
That's why they call it day wine.

1:02:27.952 --> 1:02:30.204
It's like feeding a gremlin
after 12 o'clock.

1:02:31.164 --> 1:02:34.834
Day wine is for lunch meetings
and taking the edge off the school run.

1:02:34.917 --> 1:02:38.087
Drink it in the dark,
and you'll be fighting founding fathers.

1:02:40.757 --> 1:02:42.633
But I went home, and I loved it so much,

1:02:42.717 --> 1:02:44.260
I listened to the entire soundtrack,

1:02:44.343 --> 1:02:46.679
and I found out that he got caught.

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:49.724
This woman's husband found out,
she extorted Hamilton.

1:02:49.807 --> 1:02:51.726
They told all the other politicians.

1:02:51.809 --> 1:02:54.270
He lost his wife, he lost his work.

1:02:54.353 --> 1:02:56.105
He was on track to become the president,

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:57.523
but he didn't get to.

1:02:57.607 --> 1:02:59.025
Of course not.

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:01.611
You can't fuck vulnerable women

1:03:01.694 --> 1:03:05.239
and become the President
of the United States of America.

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:12.997
What a silly little goose.

1:03:14.916 --> 1:03:17.293
He didn't get to be president. Um...

1:03:18.252 --> 1:03:21.255
And I just feel...
You don't have to live your life like me.

1:03:21.339 --> 1:03:25.343
It's just a different shape of a family
that I wish was not so stigmatized.

1:03:25.843 --> 1:03:27.929
But, I mean, Melania Trump...

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:33.601
That is an innocent gold digger
caught up in a dangerous game.

1:03:37.897 --> 1:03:40.107
That lifestyle is very dangerous.

1:03:40.191 --> 1:03:42.109
She did not know
he was gonna be the president.

1:03:42.193 --> 1:03:45.321
She thought he'd be a regular businessman
and they could be divorced by now.

1:03:45.404 --> 1:03:47.907
She'd be fucking one of J.Lo's
backup dancers through season two

1:03:47.990 --> 1:03:50.576
of her reality show, <i>Melania Unchained.</i>

1:03:54.664 --> 1:03:57.625
You need agency in your life,
and a bank account.

1:03:58.167 --> 1:03:59.377
Where did she go wrong?

1:03:59.877 --> 1:04:01.963
Well, she went too young. Didn't she?

1:04:02.547 --> 1:04:03.840
Way too young.

1:04:05.925 --> 1:04:07.051
This lady knows.

1:04:08.177 --> 1:04:09.804
You go old.

1:04:10.221 --> 1:04:12.014
Ooooooold.

1:04:12.765 --> 1:04:16.227
If he's still eating solid food,
he is too young, do you understand?

1:04:17.395 --> 1:04:19.647
You want him one line of coke
and a vigorous hand job away

1:04:19.730 --> 1:04:21.148
from you getting a summer house.

1:04:24.318 --> 1:04:27.321
<i>Oh. Oh, la la. Sacré bleu.</i>

1:04:28.030 --> 1:04:30.825
Perhaps Céline Dion
had the right idea all along.

1:04:33.202 --> 1:04:35.413
Thank you so much for listening to me.
I'll see you soon.

1:04:35.997 --> 1:04:37.039
Thank you.
