I'm getting you out of here.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.741

- Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

Remember, pretty,
I am serving life plus one.

So if I get busted for attempted escape,

Yeah, I didn't want to throw up
on the floor, so I just came to the drain.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.241
Just let me walk this off. I'll be fine.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.995

for you to be here if your IV isn't in.

- It wasn't locked, boss.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.748
The fan kept pushing it open.
So we just had to wedge it closed.

who is the warden of Fox River Penitentiary

11:04.998 --> 11:09.294
where Lincoln Burrows is scheduled to die
by electrocution at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.130
Warden Pope, can you tell me what's
gonna happen in the next few hours?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.924
There are strict
Department of Corrections guidelines

11:15.008 --> 11:17.218
that govern every aspect of an execution.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.471
Measures taken to make sure that
the process goes as smoothly as possible.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.681
Such as?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.850
The correctional officers will do
a walkthrough,

11:23.933 --> 11:25.435
we'll review the list of witnesses,

11:25.518 --> 11:28.354
the chair will be checked and rechecked
to make sure there's no problem.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.440
And Mr. Burrows himself.
Have you spoken with him?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.109
What are his thoughts
in these final hours?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.778
I'd say that's between him and his God.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.946
And maybe the Governor.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.116
I understand Burrows' attorneys
are going to request a stay.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.576
I wish them the best of luck.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.953
Does that mean you believe he's innocent?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.163
It means...

11:45.455 --> 11:49.125
I believe in the process
but I don't relish the prospect of

11:49.292 --> 11:51.044
taking another man's life.

11:51.461 --> 11:55.465
Whether it's just or not,
there's no joy that lies before us today.

Yeah. Yeah. I'll try.

I'm sorry. I'm told
that you have to wait until final visitation.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.426
Would you talk to your father
for me, please?

14:07.597 --> 14:10.308
Believe me, my father knows
where I stand on the death penalty

14:10.391 --> 14:14.854
-and I'm just as clear on his...
- Sara... Dr. Tancredi, I'm sorry.

14:16.898 --> 14:20.485
This isn't about the morality
of the death penalty. This is...

14:21.361 --> 14:25.281
This is about killing an innocent man,
my brother,

14:25.782 --> 14:28.159
and surely your father
can't be in favor of that.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.495
Just talk to Lincoln's attorneys,
just for an hour,

14:30.578 --> 14:33.623
and I swear to God
you'll be convinced of his innocence.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.041
Michael,

14:35.958 --> 14:38.753
I would pick up the phone right now
if I thought there was any chance

14:38.836 --> 14:42.131
that I could make a difference,
but you have to understand,

14:42.965 --> 14:45.927
I'm the last person in the world
that my father listens to.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.679
He hates what I do,
he hates what I believe in.

14:48.763 --> 14:53.226
And if I'm the one asking for clemency
for your brother, your brother won't get it.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.574
I'm sorry.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.588
Look, if Terrence Steadman
is still alive, Lyle,

15:22.672 --> 15:24.549
then it can't be Terrence Steadman
buried in the ground.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.052
Yeah, but a secret informant
claims that Steadman is still alive?

15:28.136 --> 15:30.138
I don't know, Nick.
It all sounds pretty far-fetched.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.473
You're his clerk, just get us on the docket.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.976
Nick, you're asking him
to commit political suicide

15:35.059 --> 15:38.688
by granting a stay of execution to
Illinois' most notorious death row inmate.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.357
Officially, all we're asking
is for an exhumation order.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.901
If he grants it, he can order a stay
until the tests come in.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.528
An exhumation order?

15:45.611 --> 15:49.157
Oh, well, that's better. Digging up
the Vice President's brother. No way.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.201
Lyle, Lyle, look, we took Intro
to Civ Pro together, remember?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.371

make a difference.

Let me worry about my problems.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.971
'Cause I know you've got enough
on your mind right now.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.056
For what it's worth, over the years,

17:37.139 --> 17:40.643
I've known a few men
who've sat on that chair,

17:40.726 --> 17:44.480
and as the day gets near,
all you can really do is pray it goes quick.

17:44.981 --> 17:49.652
Once, about 10 years ago,
there was a man caught a few sparks,

17:49.735 --> 17:51.487
not enough to do the job.

17:51.988 --> 17:56.158
Had to wait another three weeks
while they reset the whole process.

17:56.659 --> 18:00.621
And it may sound crazy, but he said
it was the worst three weeks of his life,

18:00.705 --> 18:04.333
because it's not the lightning
that kills you, it's the wait.

18:04.834 --> 18:08.296
So, take solace in the fact
that your brother's wait is over.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.965
So if something happens to the chair,

18:12.174 --> 18:13.467
he's got three more weeks?

18:13.551 --> 18:16.012
There's a lot of protocol in killing a man.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.015
A new death warrant,
another medical clearance.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
A lot can happen in three weeks.

You've always been straight up
with me, Stolte.

You have my word.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.565
VERONICA: Your Honor, from the outset,
Mr. Burrows' case has been tainted

25:24.648 --> 25:27.276
by conspiracy characterized
by destruction of evidence,

25:27.359 --> 25:29.445
distortion of the truth
and witness intimidation.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.405
Again, Judge, I have to object.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.700
These are some serious accusations
with absolutely no proof.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.327
No proof? What have I been arguing
for the past 20 minutes?

25:37.411 --> 25:38.495
You got me.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.415
Judge Kessler, Mr. Tucci
might not appreciate the weight

25:41.498 --> 25:43.751
of what we've just presented,
but surely you must.

25:43.834 --> 25:47.129
As Miss Donovan stated,
a top video forensic analyst

25:47.212 --> 25:49.631
has disputed the authenticity
of a surveillance tape

25:49.715 --> 25:52.092
that was the key piece of evidence
in convicting Lincoln Burrows.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.178
That's the tape
that no longer exists, right?

25:54.261 --> 25:56.138
Because your client had it destroyed.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.808
Unless my client is a rusted water pipe
in the County Records Office,

25:59.892 --> 26:00.976
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.771
Judge, Miss Donovan's apartment
was blown up in an attempt

26:03.854 --> 26:05.314
to silence both her and me.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.776
That was independently corroborated
as a gas leak, Your Honor.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.070
Judge, a month ago,
a Secret Service agent

26:11.153 --> 26:13.363
named Paul Kellerman visited my office.

26:13.447 --> 26:17.451
I saw Kellerman last night, when he shot
and killed another agent, Daniel Hale,

26:17.534 --> 26:20.996
right after Hale told me that
Terrence Steadman was alive and well.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.750
Your Honor, I'm presenting to the clerk
an affidavit from the director

26:24.833 --> 26:26.752
of the Secret Service Agency.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.713
It states that at no time
has there ever been

26:29.922 --> 26:34.093
an agent of that organization by the name
of Paul Kellerman, or Daniel Hale.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.179
In addition, there were no other witnesses
to this shooting.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.891
No bullets were found, no blood,
no shell casings.

26:40.974 --> 26:44.853
The only witness to this alleged murder
is Veronica Donovan,

26:45.479 --> 26:47.773
Lincoln Burrows' ex-girlfriend.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.025
Now, Your Honor, I feel for Miss Donovan.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.610
- Save it.
- I do.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.030
But desperation causes desperate acts.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.616
And that's what we're seeing here today,
Your Honor.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.869
My client,
the Vice-President of the United States...

27:00.953 --> 27:02.412
Judge Kessler.

27:03.705 --> 27:07.167
Do either of you have any evidence
that is admissible?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.169
Even just tangible?

27:09.253 --> 27:10.754
Your claims, if true, are terrifying.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.715
But anything or anyone
that could verify your story

27:13.799 --> 27:16.301
is either gone, missing or dead.

27:20.722 --> 27:25.060
I know time is of the essence.
I'll reserve judgment for now.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.896

into consideration,

27:27.980 --> 27:30.524
and I'll have a decision within a few hours.

of my existence, I swear to God.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.910
You get this a lot?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.912
Yeah, they're attracted to the heat
when they're cold,

27:43.996 --> 27:45.747
plus, they got collapsible vertebrae
or some deal,

27:45.831 --> 27:48.458
so they can squeeze through a crack
yea big, if they're determined.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.711
And he shorted out the wire
just by biting on it?

27:50.794 --> 27:54.423
Not by chewing on the wire alone,
but if the tail touches metal,

27:54.548 --> 27:57.801
it acts as a ground, and boom, fuse pops.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.637
- Along with the rat.
- I'll be damned.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.472
So, can you change the fuse?

28:02.556 --> 28:04.391
Yeah, there's another one right here
in the box.

and fill out the paperwork.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.547
LJ. It's your dad.

34:57.971 --> 34:59.139
<i>LJ: Hey, Dad.</i>

34:59.222 --> 35:02.017
LJ. So this is it.

35:02.392 --> 35:03.476
Yeah.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.354
I... <i>I</i> want you to

35:06.855 --> 35:10.984
stick with Veronica and Nick
and clear your name. You'll be all right.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.403
I wish I could be there, Dad.

35:15.697 --> 35:16.906
Me, too.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.368
'Cause there's something
I want to tell you.

35:21.703 --> 35:24.414
<i>- What's that?
- I had</i> a <i>dream last night.</i>

35:25.123 --> 35:28.418
<i>You and me were working on a house,
pounding nails.</i>

35:28.543 --> 35:30.295
And in the dream,

35:31.713 --> 35:33.882
it felt like we were older.

35:34.716 --> 35:37.802
<i>It was so clear. The whole dream.</i>

35:39.554 --> 35:41.181
<i>And when I woke,</i>

35:42.182 --> 35:45.060
<i>I knew that today
wasn't going to be the end.</i>

35:46.269 --> 35:47.395
That...

35:48.897 --> 35:50.815
That we'll see each other again, Dad.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.901
<i>I know it.</i>

35:54.861 --> 35:56.321
I love you, Dad.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.832
Those numbers support Burrows' claim

36:07.916 --> 36:10.168
about Terrence Steadman's
pending indictment.

36:10.251 --> 36:13.755
Now, with the related murders,
and then the confidential informant,

36:13.838 --> 36:16.883
I just wanted to make sure that
you were fully aware of the circumstances.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.760
I'm fully acquainted
with the Burrows case, Sara,

36:18.843 --> 36:20.387
but I never heard about any of this.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.556
Well, I hadn't either, until I spoke
with Burrows' attorneys this afternoon.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.266
And I understand
that most of this evidence

36:25.350 --> 36:28.937
is technically considered circumstantial,
but I think you'll agree it's hard to ignore.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.605
And how did you get involved
with all this?

36:30.689 --> 36:33.149
These men are my patients.
It's my job to advocate for them.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.777
Come on, Sara. How many of these guys
say that they are innocent?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.278
Eighty, ninety percent?

36:37.862 --> 36:40.949
It's not like you're asking me
for a new bike here, kid.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.993
Being tough on crime,
capital punishment,

36:44.077 --> 36:46.663
it's all part of a philosophy
that I believe in.

36:46.746 --> 36:50.083
Part of a philosophy that I campaigned on,
was elected for.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.296
I have to go back to Fox River.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.132
I have to be there when they kill this man.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.968
The least you could do is review his case.

37:00.427 --> 37:03.179
And, Dad, if it helps,
pretend it didn't come from me.

37:11.521 --> 37:14.983
I've never given a damn
about what people thought of me.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.485
Never. The last couple of days...

37:17.902 --> 37:19.946
I gotta admit, you know...

37:20.530 --> 37:21.990
(LINCOLN SIGHING)

37:22.574 --> 37:26.411
Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth,

37:27.245 --> 37:28.872
Lincoln Burrows.

37:29.289 --> 37:32.333
I'm gonna go down in history
with these freaks.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.922
Bitch of it all is I didn't do it.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.386
I didn't do it!

37:57.734 --> 37:58.777
(DOOR OPENING)

37:58.860 --> 38:00.361
I didn't do it.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.711
It's time.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.629
Warden!

39:00.505 --> 39:02.757
- What is it?
- It's the Governor.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.140
Yes, Governor.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.742
Okay. I understand.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.414
The Governor has
reviewed your case fully.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.167
He's not granting clemency.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.465
Let's proceed.

39:57.979 --> 40:02.025
You did your country and your party
a great service.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.986
It won't go unnoticed.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.531
- Thank you, Madam Vice President.
- Thank you, Governor.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.551
Can't go past here.

40:28.801 --> 40:33.139
Once he's in the death chamber,
you'll be escorted to the viewing room.

40:35.475 --> 40:36.726
Can l...

40:37.977 --> 40:39.062
Yeah.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.202
I've loved you
since the first time I saw you.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.087
Uncuff him.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.035
Let's go, son.

41:43.167 --> 41:46.212
<i>LINCOLN: I didn't kill that man, Michael.
SCOFIELD: Swear <i>to me.</i></i>

41:46.295 --> 41:47.380
<i>LINCOLN: I swear to you, Michael.</i>

41:48.715 --> 41:51.134
<i>Preparation can only take you so far.</i>

41:51.801 --> 41:54.762
<i>After that,
you gotta take a few leaps of faith.</i>

41:59.017 --> 42:00.518
<i>VERONICA: Don't give up on me.</i>

42:01.394 --> 42:04.313
<i>- What if something happens to you?
- You just have a little faith.</i>

42:05.023 --> 42:06.482
<i>Just have a little faith.</i>

42:06.566 --> 42:09.736
<i>How about every Sunday,
we have our own special breakfast?</i>

42:09.861 --> 42:11.904
<i>- Just you and me.
- Yeah.</i>

42:12.238 --> 42:15.158
LINCOLN: <i>Give me your hand.
You gotta have faith, LJ.</i>

42:20.288 --> 42:21.914
<i>LJ: I love you, Dad.</i>

42:22.665 --> 42:24.042
I came in here a man.

42:24.125 --> 42:27.170
Give me the strength
to walk out of here a man.
