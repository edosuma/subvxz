Narrator:
Tonight...

00:29.931 --> 00:31.265
Game on, boys.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.367
...the judges' battle
to find

00:33.400 --> 00:35.769
America's next MasterChef
continues.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.871
Joe: Incredible colors
going on.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.374
I'm certain that they're gonna
pick me and not you.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.110
And the competition heats up...

00:43.144 --> 00:44.878
- Oh, whoops!
- He's all yours, man.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.681
...with some of the most
talented home cooks...

00:47.714 --> 00:50.551
- ( whispering ) That's good.
- ...the MasterChef kitchen
has ever seen.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.854
Three aprons,
but let me tell you,

00:53.887 --> 00:57.658
I can get you
to the MasterChef finale.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.863
( music playing )

01:02.896 --> 01:05.532
Narrator:
The next three home cooks
hail from Houston, Texas...

01:05.566 --> 01:07.935
H-Town holding it down,
baby!

01:07.969 --> 01:10.204
...but none are more determined
to receive a white apron

01:10.237 --> 01:11.973
than 30-year-old Taylor.

01:12.006 --> 01:15.142
I can't believe that I'm here
for the third time!

01:15.176 --> 01:17.744
I'm back!

01:17.778 --> 01:19.913
You might remember me
from last season.

01:19.947 --> 01:23.717
You made a couple mistakes.
So, I'm sorry, it's a no.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.819
And the season before that.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.654
Taylor, you were that close.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.090
Do not give up.

01:29.123 --> 01:32.426
Being defeated twice hurt,

01:32.459 --> 01:34.761
but it lit a fire in me.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.064
I've perfected
my Columbian dishes,

01:37.098 --> 01:40.134
and become more knowledgeable
with different kinds
of cuisines

01:40.167 --> 01:41.602
and cooking techniques.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.670
I always strive to be the best.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.139
So, I have to try again.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.008
You ready?

01:47.041 --> 01:48.675
I'm ready, baby!
I was born ready!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.677
My name is Ralph,
and I'm an accountant,

01:50.711 --> 01:52.613
but food and cooking

01:52.646 --> 01:54.515
is where the passion is at.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.483
Oh, my God.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.453
Growing up, my parents always
worked long hours as nurses.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.322
So, my dad handed me the torch

02:01.355 --> 02:02.589
at a very young age

02:02.623 --> 02:03.824
and taught me how to cook.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.159
That was way better

02:05.192 --> 02:06.427
than I thought
it was gonna turn out.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.928
High fives around, baby!

02:07.961 --> 02:09.163
You got this!

02:09.196 --> 02:10.631
At the end of the day I cook

02:10.664 --> 02:12.433
'cause I just wanna make people
happy.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.301
And I'm gonna make
these judges happy.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.304
( music playing )

02:18.339 --> 02:20.674
H-Town is in the building!

02:20.707 --> 02:21.675
- Welcome!
- You guys ready?

02:21.708 --> 02:23.777
Yes!

02:23.810 --> 02:25.612
Chelsea:
I'm Chelsea. I'm 28.
I'm a huge hippie.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.281
I go to a ton
of music festivals.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.516
So I'm trying to resemble
like a chicken shawarma,

02:29.550 --> 02:31.385
that you would get
in the Middle East.

02:31.418 --> 02:34.321
Because of my father's career
as an oil engineer,

02:34.355 --> 02:36.890
I got to live in India,
Thailand, Sri Lanka.

02:36.923 --> 02:40.227
I'm bringing all the amazing
things I've learned
from my travels

02:40.261 --> 02:43.230
into this dish tonight.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.866
- Um, Taylor.
- Yes, Chef.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.069
You look familiar.
You've been here before, right?

02:48.102 --> 02:50.003
Maybe a time or two.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.073
- Wow! Welcome back.
- Thank you!

02:52.106 --> 02:56.143
So, you have just 30 minutes

02:56.177 --> 02:58.479
to make your signature dish.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.515
We started
with eight aprons each.

03:01.548 --> 03:05.186
Now Gordon has five,
Aarón still has seven,

03:05.219 --> 03:07.921
and I have just five
aprons left,

03:07.954 --> 03:09.656
but they're going fast.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.326
If you want an apron,
it's simple.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.696
Your dishes have to convince one
of the three of us

03:15.729 --> 03:19.733
that you are worthy of one of
our precious remaining aprons.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.169
If you're lucky enough
to have multiple offers,

03:22.203 --> 03:25.038
then you decide who you want
to be mentored by,

03:25.072 --> 03:28.041
which is a privilege.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.276
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

03:29.310 --> 03:30.577
- Ready.
- Yes.

03:30.611 --> 03:35.116
Time starts... now!

03:35.149 --> 03:38.085
( music playing )

03:38.119 --> 03:39.620
Taylor, give me an idea

03:39.653 --> 03:41.555
of what you're doing different
this time around

03:41.588 --> 03:43.190
and what's gonna get you
an apron.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.893
I've just been taking everything
that you guys told me,

03:46.927 --> 03:48.395
my passion for cooking,

03:48.429 --> 03:51.765
and I'm making a tangy
tomatillo pulled chicken.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.434
over a garlicky rice.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.802
Pull it all together
with a sunny-side egg,

03:55.836 --> 03:59.240
and then a side of traditional
Colombian hot sauce.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.108
- Third time's a charm.
- Third time's a charm.

04:01.142 --> 04:02.609
Thank you, Chef.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.812
( music playing )

04:05.846 --> 04:07.548
20 minutes remaining.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.916
All right, guys,
time is not playing around.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.386
- Ralph. Tell me about yourself.
- Yes, sir.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.588
I'm a senior accountant
from Houston, Texas.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.624
- Tell me about the dish.
- I'm making a Filipino
noodle dish

04:17.658 --> 04:19.460
that you can immerse
like a sauce into it.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.928
I'm gonna add shrimp, chicken,
little bit of pork.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.564
This is the dish

04:23.597 --> 04:25.466
that I make not only for myself

04:25.499 --> 04:27.401
but my siblings,
my wife.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.570
You seem like a more passionate
guy than a real numbers guy.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.438
I have no regrets
doing accounting,

04:31.472 --> 04:33.607
but I wanna be a chef.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.242
I'll tell you what, though.
There's no cooking
in accounting.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.610
Unless you're cooking the books.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.613
Unless you're cooking the books,
exactly.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.415
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Joe.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.116
- Chelsea.
- Yes.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.918
Give us an insight
to what you're making.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.787
I am making my take
on a lamb shawarma.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.422
I'm making a homemade
pita pocket,

04:48.455 --> 04:51.192
a really good roasted garlic
hummus and a fattoush salad.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.593
- You're making fresh pita?
- Yes.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.827
It's a little time sensitive.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.128
I gotta make sure it rises.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.630
Yeah. I'll say.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.302
Guys, we're up to seven minutes
remaining.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.770
Stop visualizing the dish,
think about the presentation,

05:03.804 --> 05:06.006
taste everything.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.775
- Taylor, te gusta? Que bueno.
- Si, me gusta!

05:08.809 --> 05:11.044
You know what?
I really like Taylor.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.013
For me, it's the
third time here,

05:13.046 --> 05:14.681
I think it's still a no.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.683
Gordon, you want us
to think

05:16.717 --> 05:20.321
she's not worth an apron.
So the path is clear for you

05:20.354 --> 05:22.623
- to go ahead and grab it.
- Maybe, Joe.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.293
Ralph, when are those
shrimp going in?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.362
Oh, my God!
They're about to go right now.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.231
Oh, my God!

05:30.264 --> 05:33.033
Guys, this is a very
exciting cookoff.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.868
A lot of energy,
a lot of stuff happening.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.904
Chelsea is making pita
from scratch.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.040
If it doesn't rise,
and it doesn't cook properly--

05:40.073 --> 05:42.509
This is the one thing
that I'm concerned with.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.977
Joe:
Ralph's dish,
I don't know.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.212
He's got a great way

05:45.246 --> 05:46.580
of communicating his passion
about food.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.081
I just hope he can
put it in the plate.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.151
It's all gonna come
together right now.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.586
Joe:
Taylor seems
like she's juggling.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.154
Got a lot of stuff going on.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.557
So many details
to put together on the plate.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.858
Hopefully she doesn't
break her egg.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.361
That would be the end
of her.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.763
Last minute, here we are.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.064
- Oh, whoops!
- Look at Ralph.
He's all over the place.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.899
Oh, man, that was close.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.701
Gordon:
Look, Chelsea's got
her pita bread out.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.603
Aarón:
Let's do it.
Come on, Chelsea!

06:09.636 --> 06:11.572
- 30 seconds left.
- There it is, there it is.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.940
She's going--
She's going with her hands.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.010
We got this,
y'all, we got this.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.580
Representing H-Town
right here, y'all.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.515
Ten, nine...

06:21.548 --> 06:24.017
- Come on, come on.
- eight, seven, six...

06:24.050 --> 06:29.089
- Oh, my God!
- five, four, three, two, one.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.624
And stop. Hands in the air.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.926
- Ralph: Oh, my God!
- Joe: Good job.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.795
- Good job, guys!
- Go, Houston!

06:34.828 --> 06:36.463
- Oh, my God.
- Gordon: Okay.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.399
Very carefully bring your dishes
down, please. Let's go.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.401
Let me remind you,

06:40.434 --> 06:43.970
all you have to do tonight
is impress one of us enough

06:44.004 --> 06:47.474
to give you one
of our white aprons.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.646
- Okay, Chelsea.
Tell me about the dish.
- Hi.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.782
So, I made lamb shawarma
with homemade bread,

06:55.816 --> 07:00.120
a fattoush salad
and roasted garlic hummus.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.955
What'd you season
the lamb with?

07:01.988 --> 07:03.424
Cayenne, cinnamon,
and sumac.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.092
You know it tastes
like really authentic,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.329
but if you wanna win
a MasterChef apron...

07:08.362 --> 07:10.764
- Yes.
- you should be able
to reinterpret this dish...

07:10.797 --> 07:13.934
- Okay.
- and make it a restaurant dish.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.336
- But very, very, good.
- Yeah.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.770
Okay. Thank you.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.973
Chelsea, um,

07:20.006 --> 07:22.175
you decided to make
your own pita bread.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.444
- Why?
- Yes. If I'm making
a street food

07:23.477 --> 07:24.678
I gotta make everything
from scratch.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.079
And that's how I cook
at home.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.483
You know, it's messy
and it's good.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.117
- All right?
- Yes.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.619
- Good job.
- Thank you.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.827
I gotta say it reminds me
of being in an Arab souk
in Morocco somewhere.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.329
My question for you is,

07:42.363 --> 07:43.964
do you think
this is good enough

07:43.997 --> 07:47.200
to be potentially mentored by me
and get you a white apron?

07:47.233 --> 07:49.636
I really, really hope so.
I do think it's good enough.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.342
- Ralph.
Describe the dish, please.
- Chef Gordon.

07:55.376 --> 07:57.310
This is Filipino pancit.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.180
The components of it is noodles
a sauce and also shrimp,

08:00.213 --> 08:01.448
and marinated with onions,

08:01.482 --> 08:03.450
garlic, just a tad bit
of soy sauce,

08:03.484 --> 08:06.653
and calamansi juice.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.021
That shrimp is
delicious.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.289
Thank you, Chef.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.691
Noodles are a bit oily.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.626
Is that good enough
for an apron?

08:12.659 --> 08:13.994
( sighs )
I don't know right now.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.662
Thank you.

08:16.863 --> 08:19.099
Señor Ralph.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.135
Mmm.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.405
It's registering a tad oily
for me as well,

08:24.438 --> 08:26.673
but otherwise,
it's seasoned beautifully.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.410
Tons of garlic and lemon.
What's not to like, right?

08:29.443 --> 08:31.612
Thank you, Chef.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.417
Mmm.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.318
Give me some other examples
of dishes you can cook.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.053
All sorts of everything.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.988
Vietnamese,
a little bit of Italian.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.991
I do like fresh,
handmade pasta.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.927
You and me might
have a future.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.361
Let me think about that.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.266
Taylor, describe the dish
really quickly for me.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.868
I have a pulled

08:54.901 --> 08:58.405
tomatillo chicken
over a garlicky rice,

08:58.439 --> 09:01.742
and then underneath
I have a jalapeño crema

09:01.775 --> 09:03.577
and a sunny-side up egg,

09:03.610 --> 09:06.212
accompanied by traditional
Colombian aji.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.453
Mmm.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.020
You know, I was thinking
to myself,

09:14.054 --> 09:15.556
how could you possibly bridge

09:15.589 --> 09:18.592
your Colombian background
with Texas,

09:18.625 --> 09:20.093
but the idea of integrating

09:20.126 --> 09:22.395
tomatillos and the chicken
does that.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.297
- Mm-hmm.
- I gotta really think hard,

09:24.330 --> 09:26.633
if I give an apron,
who it's gonna go to.

09:26.667 --> 09:30.136
- But this is making
a good argument.
- Thank you, Chef.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.539
Joe:
Tell me about the rice.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.742
They're bringing like a little
bit of elevation to it.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.110
I cooked it in beef stock.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.912
It's very rich.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.552
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.820
( whispering )
Oh, my God.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.656
- Taylor.
- Yes, Chef.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.893
Presentation wise,
it should be in a bowl.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.095
- However, it's all
in the flavor.
- Okay.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.801
- Taylor.
- Yes, Chef.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.970
- Third time here.
- Yes, Chef.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.742
It's bloody delicious.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.112
Really delicious.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.981
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.417
- Good job, good job.
- Thank you.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.588
Three home cooks
that call Houston, Texas home.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.525
My aprons are only going to
people that are risk takers,

10:24.558 --> 10:27.694
and one of you guys
fits the bill.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.963
- Wow.
- ( Whispering ) Oh, my God.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.532
I'm looking for

10:31.565 --> 10:34.200
home cooks that come into this
kitchen with confidence.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.136
Also home cooks

10:36.169 --> 10:38.505
that I think have
the passion

10:38.539 --> 10:41.341
to reach the very,
very top.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.310
And I do see that
in one of you three.

10:45.546 --> 10:50.050
I do have an apron
to give out

10:50.083 --> 10:53.620
to a home cook
who still has a lot to learn,

10:53.654 --> 10:56.657
but has the potential
to go a long, long way.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.527
Joe:
Three aprons.

11:00.561 --> 11:02.028
At least one of you are going
home with an apron.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.231
But two of you might
leave here without one.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.201
- Should we go?
- Oh, my God.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.237
( music playing )

11:17.210 --> 11:20.046
Three home cooks that call
Houston, Texas home.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.583
Three aprons.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.517
Gordon:
At least one of you are going
home with an apron.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.553
- Oh, my God.
- Should we go?

11:26.587 --> 11:28.855
Please, Houston.
Please.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.563
- Are you serious?
- Congratulations.

11:36.597 --> 11:38.531
Are you--

11:38.565 --> 11:41.034
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

11:41.067 --> 11:43.036
Yeah, baby!

11:43.069 --> 11:44.605
Yes! Let's go!

11:44.638 --> 11:46.907
One shot!
Hold me down, baby!

11:46.940 --> 11:48.341
Let's go!

11:48.374 --> 11:50.711
Congratulations.
That's a first for us.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.279
- Oh, my God!
- Well done.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.416
Taylor:
It's surreal that I'm walking
out of those doors

11:56.449 --> 12:00.954
with not only an apron,
but a Gordon Ramsay pin.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.256
- You three, off you go.
- Thank you!

12:03.289 --> 12:05.291
Taylor:
I finally earned my spot here!

12:05.325 --> 12:07.427
I'm so excited!
Oh, my God!

12:07.460 --> 12:10.597
- I can't believe it.
- And representing Houston

12:10.631 --> 12:12.532
with Ralph and Chelsea today

12:12.565 --> 12:15.468
was like the icing on the cake.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.804
Gordon:
Ralph.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.539
Why did you give Ralph an apron?
I thought you wanted Taylor.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.609
That is exactly what I wanted
you to think, my friend.

12:22.643 --> 12:24.077
I mean, Taylor--

12:24.110 --> 12:25.912
Trust me, the finesse
she brought tonight,

12:25.946 --> 12:28.048
I haven't seen that so far
in this competition.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.416
- Wow! This guy's a real cook.
- I'm amazed that you don't--

12:30.450 --> 12:31.818
- No.
- I could put him in the line
tomorrow in the restaurant.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.553
Aarón:
Guys, pita from scratch.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
- That's all I gotta say.
- Yeah.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.891
Narrator:
Up next is Olusola,

12:37.924 --> 12:40.060
a 29-year-old bus driver
from South Carolina.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.128
I cook from my heart.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.064
Just like I drive the bus
with passion.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.499
I've been a bus driver
for roughly 11 years.

12:46.532 --> 12:47.934
Even though I love bus driving,

12:47.968 --> 12:48.969
I'd rather be cooking.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.004
I am the flavor queen.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.505
I cook food
that tickles your soul,

12:52.538 --> 12:54.407
being that
I'm a soul food cook.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.476
I'm gonna put Olusola
on this dish,

12:56.509 --> 12:58.344
and I'm just hoping and praying

12:58.378 --> 13:00.747
that all three judges are
fighting to give me an apron.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.315
( cheering and applause )

13:02.348 --> 13:04.651
You ready?

13:04.685 --> 13:06.687
- Good luck, big guy.
- Mark: My name is Mark.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.289
I'm a firefighter and I'm
from Shreveport, Louisiana.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.157
I've been a firefighter
for 12 years.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.193
Been cooking my whole life.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.627
We're a family at the station.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.196
So, I love cooking
for the guys.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.665
Rub-a-dub-dub,
come get this grub.

13:18.699 --> 13:20.667
We have from chicken
and dumplings,

13:20.701 --> 13:22.202
to fried chicken,

13:22.235 --> 13:24.137
to biscuits and gravy
in the morning.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.638
If it's fried and smothered
and covered,

13:25.672 --> 13:26.873
you're good.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.842
( music playing )

13:28.875 --> 13:30.877
- Oh, God!
- God!

13:30.911 --> 13:32.979
- My God!
- This is good to see.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.516
I put out fires, so therefore,
I can handle the pressure

13:36.549 --> 13:38.785
and the heat
of the MasterChef kitchen.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.721
Good evening.

13:40.754 --> 13:43.189
Now, I'd like to give
each of you an apron,

13:43.223 --> 13:45.491
but we have
to be very careful

13:45.525 --> 13:46.727
on who we choose.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.629
Joe is down
to just four aprons.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.832
And I've got six left.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.969
And I've got four
white aprons remaining.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.805
Both of you are cooking
your signature dishes.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.073
Yes.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.575
You both got just 30 minutes
on the clock.

14:02.608 --> 14:06.913
Your 30 minutes starts now!

14:06.947 --> 14:09.950
( music playing )

14:14.687 --> 14:18.158
Garlic, cumin, chili powder.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.193
Olusola, give a little insight
to the dish.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.029
I'll be making real
authentic soul food.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.866
Jerk snapper
with a pineapple salsa,

14:25.899 --> 14:27.700
coconut rice and
sautéed cabbage.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.070
I drive city buses
in South Carolina,

14:30.103 --> 14:31.404
When I get off work

14:31.437 --> 14:32.939
at 1:30, 2 o'clock
in the morning,

14:32.973 --> 14:34.540
I enjoy cooking the jerk,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.210
because it's sweet and spicy
just like me.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.012
Tell us
what you're doing.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.547
- What are you putting in there?
- I'm putting some allspice...

14:41.581 --> 14:44.684
- Right.
- coriander, ground ginger,
garlic clove...

14:44.717 --> 14:48.121
- Just free pouring.
- peppers, smoked paprika.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.090
How many spices are you putting
in there? It's endless.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.292
There's about 15 spices
to get jerk properly.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.394
- And you're just free pouring.
- I'm free pouring.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.763
I don't have time to measure.
I got 30 minutes
to make it happen.

14:56.797 --> 14:58.198
That takes a lot
of confidence.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.867
- Wow!
- I don't have time.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.969
Six minutes gone,
24 minutes remaining.

15:03.003 --> 15:06.039
- Gotta shine.
- ( humming )

15:06.072 --> 15:08.241
- All right, Mark,
what are you cooking?
- This dish right here--

15:08.274 --> 15:10.043
I'm cooking buttermilk biscuits
and gravy.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.412
I'm a fireman
back in Shreveport, Louisiana.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.615
Homemade biscuits is one of
the staple dishes when cooking
at the fire station.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.050
Man, you know,
my fire crew

15:17.083 --> 15:19.385
have yet left a biscuit
on the table.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.122
- Completely get that done
in 30 minutes?
- Yes, sir.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.229
Between these
two contestants,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.131
who today is taking
the biggest risk?

15:31.164 --> 15:32.833
Gordon:
Oh, I think Mark's taking
the biggest risk.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.601
- Just trying to bake a biscuit
in 30 minutes.
- Yeah.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.838
What does a gravy mean
traditionally in Louisiana?

15:37.871 --> 15:40.974
You make a roux,
you have a thickener and then
you cook that in pork fat.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.643
- Gordon: But roux need time
to cook out.
- Exactly.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.945
15 minutes, he hasn't even
started cooking anything yet.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.479
Aarón:
Yeah, it's true.

15:46.512 --> 15:47.780
Olusola's playing
to her strengths

15:47.814 --> 15:49.850
with the blend
and the spices jerk.

15:49.883 --> 15:51.451
It'd be one thing to have
a Michelin-starred chef

15:51.484 --> 15:53.119
kind of free-throwing
spices.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.321
- Yeah.
- To have a home cook,
bus driver--

15:55.355 --> 15:57.757
does she have the experience
to balance those flavors.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.326
If Olusola could manage all
those very assertive spices,

16:00.360 --> 16:01.962
and pull off
a harmonious dish,

16:01.995 --> 16:04.330
that's gonna go
high marks with me.

16:04.364 --> 16:07.100
- Just under 14 minutes
remaining.
- Gotcha.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.768
Mark, biscuits are
in the oven, yes?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.370
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Good.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.472
Olusola, you ever have any
like dedicated riders

16:12.505 --> 16:14.340
who just want to ride
with you?

16:14.374 --> 16:15.976
Yes, I have dedicated riders.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.344
They wait for me
because they get to eat my food.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.779
And they,
for some reason

16:19.812 --> 16:22.548
come on the bus with utensils
and forks,

16:22.582 --> 16:24.384
and knives.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.785
And they're always ready to eat.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.453
I wanna be on the Olusola bus.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.422
The fare's two dollars
and fifty cents.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.558
Just under ten minutes, guys.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.661
Mark, you are
in a high-pressure job
that saves lives.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.163
How does that stack up
to the pressure

16:37.197 --> 16:38.398
of the MasterChef
kitchen?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.033
Being prepared for the unknown.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.334
That's what I'm ready for.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.568
I ran into a lot
of burning buildings.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.970
Well, you know here,

16:44.004 --> 16:45.872
this is a one, two,
three alarm blaze

16:45.906 --> 16:47.807
- you have to deal with, so...
- Definitely.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.910
- no firehouse chili.
- Yes, sir.

16:49.943 --> 16:53.013
Five minutes remaining.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.648
Mark's gonna need every one
of those five minutes.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.050
That biscuit's gonna
have to be flaky.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.318
It's gonna have to be cooked
in the center.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.320
It can't be gooey.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.587
Check my cabbage.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.356
Olusola is nonstop
tasting.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.425
Everything she's touching,
she's tasting.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.260
Tastes good to me.

17:07.293 --> 17:10.196
90 seconds to go.
Come on, you got this.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.898
- Mark starts to plate.
- Yeah, man.

17:11.932 --> 17:13.934
- Wow!
- Joe: Wow! They look nice
and fluffy.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.069
- It's go time.
- Gotta make it happen.

17:16.102 --> 17:19.339
- 30 seconds remaining!
- Oh, man.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.773
No way.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.909
Sh--

17:22.943 --> 17:24.210
- Oh no, it looks--
- Uh-oh.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.379
- Sh--
- Sticky the aluminum foil

17:26.412 --> 17:28.414
- could cost you an apron.
- Let's go, Olusola.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.083
No. It's okay.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.417
15 seconds to go.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.919
Come on, come on!

17:32.953 --> 17:34.754
Gently, gently, gently.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.556
Oh, shoot!

17:42.462 --> 17:45.198
Both of you are cooking
your signature dishes.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.033
Gotta make it happen.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.534
30 seconds remaining!

17:48.568 --> 17:50.703
Sh--

17:50.736 --> 17:51.972
- Oh no, it looks--
- Uh-oh.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.240
- Sh--
- Sticky aluminum foil

17:54.274 --> 17:56.276
- could cost you an apron.
- Let's go, Olusola.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.944
No. It's okay.

17:57.978 --> 17:59.279
15 seconds to go.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.780
Come on, come on!

18:00.813 --> 18:02.615
Gently, gently, gently.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.484
Oh, shoot!

18:06.852 --> 18:08.488
Joe:
She recovered.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.456
I think her experience is
really showing through.

18:10.490 --> 18:15.928
Five, four, three, two, one.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.597
And stop.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.999
- Well done.
- Wow!

18:19.032 --> 18:20.833
Well done. That was close.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.435
Right, very carefully,

18:22.468 --> 18:25.071
both of you bring your dishes
down to the front.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.273
- Thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.109
Wow!

18:31.544 --> 18:32.845
Looks good.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.281
Well done.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.023
Let's do it.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.857
Olusola,
describe the dish, please.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.860
Olusola:
So here you have a jerk snapper

18:47.893 --> 18:51.864
with a pineapple salsa, coconut
rice, and sautéed cabbage.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.833
It's a meaty fish.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.868
- It is.
- It should be glistening,

18:55.901 --> 18:58.671
almost like a pearl inside
when we come through the middle.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.174
Yes, Chef.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.678
Beautiful.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.147
Moist.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.581
Glistening.

19:14.054 --> 19:16.122
The fish,
you've definitely nailed.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.391
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.169
( whispering )
You're making me nervous.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.171
I wouldn't be nervous
if I were on your bus.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.573
- No.
- Sometimes I like to sit
way up front.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.875
Like in the seats reserved
for the elderly people.

19:35.908 --> 19:39.079
- Would you throw me out?
- I can't do that,
due to certain policies.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.147
It's called
ADA violation.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.849
So, I cannot make you
give up your seat.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.763
Mmm, I like this.
This sautéed cabbage

19:57.797 --> 19:58.931
is one of the best things
on the dish.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.600
It seems like
the throwaway

20:00.633 --> 20:02.168
but it's really well done,
it has good flavor.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.070
( whispering )
That's good.

20:12.112 --> 20:14.414
Those exotic spices like
the clove and the pimento--

20:14.447 --> 20:17.517
They're not overpowering
the delicate nature
of the fish, which I like.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.752
- Okay.
- And I just think
you gotta give me more.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.187
Give me more pineapple salsa.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.224
- Okay.
- But overall...

20:26.592 --> 20:29.929
- Mark. Biscuits and gravy.
- Yes, Chef.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.765
Mark: Yes, sir.
Buttermilk biscuits and gravy.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.767
Gordon:
What did you season
that gravy with?

20:34.800 --> 20:37.703
Mark:
I did salt and pepper,
poured some garlic powder,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.639
and also some hot sauce.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.975
The biscuit should be
sort of light and fluffy

20:43.008 --> 20:44.977
- in the center there.
- Yes, sir.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.648
So it's quite doughy there.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.816
- Yes, Chef.
- Quite dense.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.152
And what did you glaze
the biscuits with?

20:52.185 --> 20:53.819
You've got a beautiful color
on top.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.289
Before I put 'em in the oven
I glaze them with buttermilk

20:56.322 --> 20:59.425
and butter on top
to top it off with.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.327
It's a beautiful color on there.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.997
Great seasoning on the sausage.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.299
The garlic powder
and the salt, lovely.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.668
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.637
Your biscuit...

21:11.671 --> 21:14.940
it's a little bit raw.

21:16.176 --> 21:17.343
The flavor is excellent.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.811
This roux is cooked very well.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.112
Thank you, Chef.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.847
90 seconds more in the oven.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.983
- Yes, Chef.
- Could've been perfection

21:24.016 --> 21:27.019
for what is a perfectly,
perfectly seasoned dish.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.655
Thank you, Chef.

21:37.363 --> 21:40.333
Love the flavor
of the gravy.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.335
I love the flavor of the pork.
I think it's really great.

21:42.368 --> 21:45.205
Like the fact that you were able
to kind of reinforce it

21:45.238 --> 21:46.839
with all that richness.
Good job.

21:46.872 --> 21:48.208
Yes, sir. I appreciate it.

21:53.012 --> 21:57.116
Remember, we started out
with eight aprons each.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.152
Joe and I have already handed
out four aprons each.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.455
Aarón has handed out two.

22:02.488 --> 22:07.293
So we must be absolutely certain
on who we choose.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.161
Aarón:
All three of us might
offer you an apron.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.564
If that happens,
it's down to you guys

22:11.597 --> 22:15.034
to decide who you want
to mentor you

22:15.067 --> 22:16.636
throughout this
whole competition.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.304
Well, guys.
Joe, let's start off with you.

22:18.338 --> 22:21.341
Do you have anybody worthy
of an apron?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.076
Yeah, there's one.

22:27.513 --> 22:30.483
Aarón?

22:30.516 --> 22:33.719
You know what, Gordon? One
of these home cooks is worthy.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.021
Wow!

22:36.055 --> 22:41.727
I, too, like someone here.

22:43.929 --> 22:46.432
Three aprons.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.534
( whispering )
Oh, wow!

22:48.568 --> 22:51.036
Wow! Joe, make your move.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.481
Aarón, your move.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.454
- Wow!
- Here's my apron.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.562
Gordon:
Olusola.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.598
( whispering )
Oh, my God!

23:23.836 --> 23:25.237
( gasping )

23:25.271 --> 23:27.072
- Olusola--
- ( whispering ) Oh, my God!

23:27.106 --> 23:31.644
You have three aprons
from three judges.

23:31.677 --> 23:34.647
Now, one of us is gonna
become your mentor.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.649
Aarón:
Olusola, here's the deal.

23:36.682 --> 23:39.752
I come from a restaurant family,
I've been through it all.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.321
Trust me.
You wanna go with me.

23:41.354 --> 23:42.788
Right, Olusola.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.425
Gordon:
Trust me.
I've got 33 restaurants.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.927
I am your mentor.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.495
Olusola, you don't need
a chef mentor.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.796
I have the savvy,

23:50.830 --> 23:53.065
the insight to take you
all the way

23:53.098 --> 23:54.467
to the "MasterChef" victory.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.436
This is the apron
you wanna pick.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.137
Oh, my gosh!

23:58.170 --> 24:00.205
This is so hard!

24:02.942 --> 24:05.277
Chef Gordon Ramsay,

24:05.311 --> 24:07.613
I adore you!

24:07.647 --> 24:09.181
And I love, Aarón,
I really do.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.317
And the person
that intimidated me

24:11.351 --> 24:13.353
prior coming in here
was you, Joe.

24:13.386 --> 24:17.189
But today is a really
hard decision for me.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.824
You want my apron.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.093
I'm gonna go with Joe.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.595
There you go.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.330
It's yours.

24:24.364 --> 24:26.198
Whoo! Yeah!

24:26.231 --> 24:27.967
Thank you!

24:28.000 --> 24:29.369
Thank you! Thank you!

24:29.402 --> 24:30.636
Ooh!

24:30.670 --> 24:32.137
Congratulations,
young lady.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.873
You just took Joe's apron.

24:33.906 --> 24:37.009
Mark, unfortunately,
tonight you're going home.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.711
Yes, sir.

24:38.744 --> 24:41.213
You know, the hero of a biscuit
and gravy is that biscuit.

24:41.246 --> 24:43.282
Had you rolled them
thinner,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.017
and literally,

24:45.050 --> 24:46.819
kept them in the oven
for another two minutes.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.821
- Great gravy, great seasoning!
- Yes, sir.

24:48.854 --> 24:50.356
Do not stop here.

24:50.390 --> 24:52.658
Let's make that right.
Well done, both of you.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.194
Off you go.

24:55.227 --> 24:58.030
- Congratulations, girl!
- Thank you.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.566
- You got that apron.
Yeah, man!
- Thank you.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.035
Joe:
I'm taking a ride on her bus,

25:03.068 --> 25:04.670
to the "MasterChef"
finale.

25:04.704 --> 25:05.971
- How's that sound?
- Only mistake she made tonight,

25:06.005 --> 25:07.573
she chose the wrong judge.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.208
She doesn't need a chef
because she could cook.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.643
- She needs me.
- Oh, please.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.478
I will give her
spiritual guidance.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.213
- Spiritual?
- The strategy

25:14.246 --> 25:16.382
to win this whole competition
is right here, my friend.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.884
- Spiritual.
- You've never been on a bus
in your life.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.152
I've been on a bus.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.787
- When?
- A yellow one.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.026
( cheering and applause )

25:30.430 --> 25:34.033
( screaming )

25:34.066 --> 25:36.602
Olusola:
I never thought I would have
the opportunity

25:36.636 --> 25:38.270
to be in the "MasterChef"
competition,

25:38.303 --> 25:39.739
and here I am today.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.240
I got offered three aprons.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.276
- So--
- ( cheering and applause )

25:46.378 --> 25:47.613
Aww!

25:47.647 --> 25:48.781
It's all right!

25:48.814 --> 25:50.516
I didn't get an apron today,

25:50.550 --> 25:52.752
but I'm very happy
that I made it this far.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.253
No matter what happens,

25:54.286 --> 25:56.756
nothing extinguish my fire
for cooking,

25:56.789 --> 25:58.758
'cause I had to risk it
for the biscuit,

25:58.791 --> 26:00.292
but it's all gravy, baby.

26:00.325 --> 26:02.061
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

26:02.094 --> 26:03.963
Narrator:
Mark wasn't the only one

26:03.996 --> 26:05.631
to not get a white apron.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.767
As the night moved on...

26:07.800 --> 26:09.301
Why do I wanna give you
an apron?

26:09.334 --> 26:10.803
Being a criminal defense
attorney,

26:10.836 --> 26:12.772
- I'm a hustler.
- Wow!

26:12.805 --> 26:15.074
...the aprons got tougher
and tougher to earn.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.976
Come on!
What happened?

26:17.009 --> 26:19.144
- And...
- Have you ever been to a
restaurant?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.080
Unfortunately, no, Joe.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.082
- ...many home cooks...
- If I get a closing argument,

26:23.115 --> 26:25.551
I can convince you
I can improve--

26:25.585 --> 26:26.919
I'm not running a courtroom.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.788
I'm running a competition.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.055
...fail to persuade.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.557
Decision time.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.226
- It's a no.
- For me... no.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.597
- I'm just not seeing enough.
- The verdict is in for me, too.

26:37.630 --> 26:38.998
No.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.399
( cheering and applause )

26:40.432 --> 26:43.469
And walked away empty-handed.

26:43.503 --> 26:45.237
- Just wasn't my night.
- Babe, you did your best.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.772
- I'm proud of you.
- It was hard.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.407
I know.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.011
Leaving Gordon with three,
Joe with four,

26:52.044 --> 26:53.979
and Aarón with six
white aprons.

26:54.013 --> 26:57.650
Guys, high expectations,
but they all fell
a little bit short.

26:57.683 --> 27:02.354
As they await the next group
of home cooks.

27:02.387 --> 27:03.689
I'm doing snapper.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.758
I've been put with three
excellent cooks

27:05.791 --> 27:07.126
who are also doing fish.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.160
I'm gonna go in there
and get that apron.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.862
I'm Cesar.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.797
I'm from Texas and I'm
a high school teacher.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.967
Today's warm up is going to be
something we did last Friday.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.970
And cooking to me is a means
of self-expression.

27:18.003 --> 27:20.172
I'm here to showcase
Mexican cuisine,

27:20.205 --> 27:22.508
and voice my knowledge
throughout the world.

27:22.542 --> 27:24.009
All right,
let's make that happen!

27:24.043 --> 27:25.277
My name's Matt.
I'm 28 years old

27:25.310 --> 27:26.445
and I'm an optometrist.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.013
Keep looking up there
for me.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.982
Even though
I'm very science minded,

27:30.015 --> 27:31.951
the thing about cooking that I
love is it's not just science.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.853
There's also an art to it.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.220
I like playing around
with doing different styles.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.722
Vision's really important to me

27:36.756 --> 27:37.990
and how things appear
on the plate.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.291
As an optometrist,

27:39.324 --> 27:41.060
you know I have my eyes
on that prize.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.294
- Let's do it, Ryan!
- It's happening, baby!

27:42.327 --> 27:43.663
My name is Ryan.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.330
I'm 33 years old
and I'm a drummer

27:45.364 --> 27:47.499
from Texas.

27:47.533 --> 27:50.035
Playing drums has taken me
everywhere,

27:50.069 --> 27:52.071
and I've eaten just
about everything.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.039
What I'm really just trying
to do is

27:54.073 --> 27:55.875
take people around the world
through a plate.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.311
- Come on down.
- I'm S.J.,

27:59.344 --> 28:00.813
I'm 21 years old,

28:00.846 --> 28:03.382
also known as the flavor
prince of K-Town.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.484
Growing up in Koreatown,

28:05.517 --> 28:07.019
I was exposed to traditional
Korean dishes,

28:07.052 --> 28:09.188
but I wanted something more

28:09.221 --> 28:10.556
than just Korean
traditional flavors.

28:10.590 --> 28:12.858
I wanted to incorporate
Korean cuisine

28:12.892 --> 28:15.094
with different,
modern techniques

28:15.127 --> 28:18.530
that really exposes Korean food
in a new and exciting way.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.504
Welcome to the incredible
MasterChef kitchen.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.373
You four are the final four
cooks of the night.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.843
We each started out
with eight aprons,

28:30.876 --> 28:32.878
and, my friends,
the good news for you

28:32.912 --> 28:35.180
is that we've still got
some left.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.083
You've got 40 minutes
on the clock

28:38.117 --> 28:40.552
to cook us your incredible
signature dishes.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.521
All of you, good luck.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.690
Your time starts now!

28:44.724 --> 28:46.926
- ( music playing )
- Nice.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.794
- Ryan: Excited, Cesar?
- Very excited.
How are you feeling?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.696
Ryan:
Feeling it.
We're just getting going, man.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.431
Cesar, tell me
what are you doing.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.034
Tonight I'm preparing
a red snapper

28:55.067 --> 28:57.369
with the flavors
of a Coctel de Mariscos.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.539
It's a tomato, citrus,
chili cocktail.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.742
My family heritage is Mexican.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.877
People say I'm too American
to be Mexican,

29:04.910 --> 29:07.079
but too Mexican
to be American.

29:07.112 --> 29:11.817
So I found that when I cook,
I can marry my Mexican culture

29:11.851 --> 29:15.587
with my American upbringing
and I'm capturing that
on the plate tonight.

29:15.621 --> 29:16.956
- Love that idea.
- Thank you, Chef.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.624
Just under 32 minutes to go.

29:18.658 --> 29:20.559
- Let's go, guys.
- Brother, you're cranking, man.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.561
- I'm trying.
- Matt, tell me about the dish.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.396
Tonight I'm doing
a pan roasted cod.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.131
with a turnip puree,
some pickled carrots

29:26.165 --> 29:27.399
and then I marinate
in beurre blanc sauce.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.168
Matt, how are you gonna
make it special?

29:29.201 --> 29:32.137
Plating is one of the things
I try to strive to be best at.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.106
I'm an optometrist.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.975
- So how things look is really
important to me.
- Love it.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.944
Halfway. Just coming up
to 20 minutes remaining.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.746
Smelling good over there, Ryan.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.682
Ryan, talk to me a little bit
about your dish.

29:42.715 --> 29:44.283
I'm a drummer from the South.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.751
So I'm doing a baked catfish

29:45.785 --> 29:47.352
with a bacon wrap
haricot verts

29:47.386 --> 29:49.655
- and a dirty rice dish.
- Baking catfish

29:49.689 --> 29:51.123
as opposed to frying it.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.591
Everybody and their mom
fries catfish

29:52.624 --> 29:53.993
down South,

29:54.026 --> 29:55.995
and my travels have taken me
everywhere.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.763
I wanna show some techniques,

29:57.797 --> 29:59.131
- some things I've learned.
- Well, best of luck.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.466
- Thank you, sir.
- There you go, Ryan.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.969
- Let's get it, let's get it!
- S.J., what are you making
tonight?

30:04.003 --> 30:07.873
I'm preparing a panko crusted
cod with honey buttered chips,

30:07.907 --> 30:10.843
cucumber kimchi, and
a gochujang sesame aioli.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.311
Growing up
with my grandmother,

30:12.344 --> 30:14.980
in a traditional Korean
household,

30:15.014 --> 30:16.348
men were not looked as as chefs.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.684
And so tonight,
I'm definitely gonna show

30:18.718 --> 30:20.953
I am more than meets the eye
with my cooking.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.688
Sounds amazing.

30:22.722 --> 30:24.990
- Five minutes remaining.
- Let's go, guys.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.125
Four incredibly sounding dishes.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.693
So, S.J.,

30:27.727 --> 30:30.029
That cod has to be slightly
salted, in order to keep

30:30.062 --> 30:32.631
that water out to keep
the batter nice and crispy.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.868
The big risk tonight for me
is Ryan and his catfish.

30:35.901 --> 30:38.003
And I'm concerned the idea
of baking catfish,

30:38.037 --> 30:39.238
it might be too aggressive

30:39.271 --> 30:41.006
for that particular
flakey fish.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.575
But on the other hand,
I really like risk takers.

30:43.608 --> 30:47.046
And those are the kinda people
that I wanna give my apron to.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.547
Pump it up.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.750
- Matt, how's the beurre blanc?
- It looks okay.

30:50.783 --> 30:52.151
I'm trying to take it on
and off the heat so it
doesn't get too hot.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.652
I don't want it
to break.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.154
Matt obviously has a level
of sophistication

30:55.187 --> 30:56.989
that's above the rest
of the crowd.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.324
With my aprons that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.659
Aarón:
I really like
what Cesar's doing.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.395
Searing that fish,
hot pan, skin side down.

31:03.428 --> 31:04.764
Straight ballin'!

31:04.797 --> 31:07.166
90 seconds remaining.
You've got this.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.001
Think about your garnishes,
think about your sauce.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.903
Let's go, guys!
Push, push.

31:10.936 --> 31:14.373
S.J.'s got some incredible
colors going on on his plating.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.176
60 seconds remaining.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.278
- Now or never, now or never!
- One stunning portion.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.946
Come on, guys!
Y'all got this!

31:20.980 --> 31:23.015
- Finish strong.
- Ten, nine...

31:23.048 --> 31:27.086
eight, seven, six, five, four...

31:27.119 --> 31:29.621
- You guys got it.
- three, two, one.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.556
- And stop. Hands in the air.
- Nice job.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.958
- Well done.
- Great job, guys.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.468
Four amazing dishes.
Let's get that right.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.570
I can't wait
to start tasting them.

31:47.472 --> 31:50.776
Let's do it.

31:50.810 --> 31:52.644
Cesar,
describe the dish, please.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.981
Cesar:
Chef, I have a pan seared
red snapper,

31:56.015 --> 31:58.784
with an orange guajillo
beurre blanc,

31:58.818 --> 32:01.386
a habanero and shallot
guacamole,

32:01.420 --> 32:04.223
crispy rice and chive radishes
for garnish.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.059
- What'd you cook the fish in?
- Grapeseed oil.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.293
It has a higher
smoke point

32:08.327 --> 32:10.930
and I didn't want it
to burn.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.265
- Delicious.
Seasoned beautifully.
- Thank you.

32:13.298 --> 32:14.900
You've got the contrast

32:14.934 --> 32:16.969
of the right kind
of texture, the heat.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.503
- Delicious. Great job.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.845
The fish is good.

32:25.878 --> 32:28.047
- Very nice job.
- Thank you.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.116
Cesar, do you feel like

32:31.150 --> 32:32.451
you have got a lot
going on in this dish?

32:32.484 --> 32:34.419
I feel there's different
components,

32:34.453 --> 32:36.989
but they replicate
the Coctel de Mariscos.

32:37.022 --> 32:41.126
That tastes like
I'm in Veracruz,
on the beach.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.929
And I think
the real star here

32:43.963 --> 32:45.831
is that skin
with that crispiness.

32:45.865 --> 32:48.533
Well done.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.269
Matt,
name of the dish?

32:50.302 --> 32:53.338
This is a pan roasted cod
with a turnip puree.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.174
There's a little shaved apple
and fennel in it,

32:55.207 --> 32:58.110
and those are pickled carrots
rolled in tarragon dust

32:58.143 --> 32:59.644
with some fingerling
potato chips.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.446
Talk to me
about your plating here.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.215
Plating is big to me.
You know, I'm an optometrist.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.150
So, vision is
an important sense.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.718
You eat
with your eyes first.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.656
Great cook on the fish.
I like what I see.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.025
Nice job.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.431
- Love it!
- Thanks, Chef.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.572
Fish, delicious.
You've nailed it. Great job.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.374
Thank you, Chef.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.543
Ryan, explain the dish.

33:31.576 --> 33:34.679
I have a baked catfish
with a dirty rice,

33:34.713 --> 33:37.416
with ground turkey and
a bacon wrapped haricot verts

33:37.449 --> 33:39.251
Catfish, why?

33:39.284 --> 33:41.887
I'm from Houston, Texas.
So, I grew up eating catfish.

33:41.921 --> 33:45.490
And I definitely wanted
to keep those southern flavors.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.993
Man!
Fish is cooked perfect.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.162
There's a nice little richness.
You have that beautiful crust.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.397
The beans with the bacon--
It's crispy.

33:52.431 --> 33:55.167
The dirty rice is
a little clunky,

33:55.200 --> 33:56.936
but amazing dish, Ryan.

33:56.969 --> 33:59.071
Thank you, Chef.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.346
Catfish, delicious.
Let's get that right.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.448
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:13.552 --> 34:17.022
For me, a bit too rustic
but executed well.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.124
- Good dish.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.395
S.J.,
describe the dish, please.

34:23.428 --> 34:27.266
S.J.:
For you I have prepared
a panko crusted cod fillet,

34:27.299 --> 34:29.901
with honey buttered chips,
cucumber kimchi,

34:29.935 --> 34:31.736
and a gochujang sesame aioli.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.305
Love that crispiness.

34:33.338 --> 34:34.974
How long did you cook it for?

34:35.007 --> 34:36.541
Eight to nine minutes.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.411
Absolutely nailed
without a doubt.

34:39.444 --> 34:42.547
The balance is there.
The sweet, the acidity,
the sugar, kimchi.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.416
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

34:49.854 --> 34:52.257
It's crunchy, sweet, sour.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.426
It's good.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.969
The fish is perfect,
the aioli is immaculate,

35:04.003 --> 35:05.437
and the pickles are bright.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.606
Good job!

35:07.639 --> 35:09.308
You, too, bro.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.276
Gents, great job.
I mean, clearly for me,

35:11.310 --> 35:13.478
one of the best
rounds tonight.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.014
Now, let me remind you,

35:15.047 --> 35:18.150
we started the competition
with only eight aprons each.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.152
Those aprons are
dwindling quickly.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.653
I've got four left.

35:21.686 --> 35:24.023
Aarón has six,
Joe only has three.

35:24.056 --> 35:27.092
Remember, though,
you only have to please

35:27.126 --> 35:29.628
one of us three
to take an apron.

35:29.661 --> 35:33.532
And if any of you are lucky
enough to get multiple offers,

35:33.565 --> 35:36.668
then it's down to you
to decide

35:36.701 --> 35:39.171
which judge will
be your mentor.

35:39.204 --> 35:42.107
A very important
and strategic decision.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.375
Right.

35:43.408 --> 35:45.810
Aarón, let's start
with you, please.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.813
I gotta say,
cooking fish is a true barometer

35:48.847 --> 35:50.449
of a great cook
at one of my restaurants.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.917
I'm blown away.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.260
It's not enough for me, though.

36:03.928 --> 36:05.230
I'm gonna give out three aprons.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.532
What?

36:07.566 --> 36:09.334
Three aprons, Aarón?

36:09.368 --> 36:11.836
- You only got six left.
- When you have talent
like this,

36:11.870 --> 36:14.906
you can't let it walk
out the door.

36:22.214 --> 36:24.683
My first apron...

36:24.716 --> 36:27.219
I'm gonna give it to...

36:36.228 --> 36:38.930
I'm gonna give out three aprons.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.701
My first apron...

36:42.734 --> 36:45.237
I'm gonna give it to...

36:47.772 --> 36:50.909
S.J.

36:55.414 --> 36:58.283
My second apron goes to...

37:02.754 --> 37:06.125
Ryan,
you get the second apron.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.628
My third apron goes to...

37:11.396 --> 37:13.965
Cesar.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.800
Thank you, Chef.

37:15.834 --> 37:19.104
- You get my third apron.
- Thank you, Chef Aarón.

37:24.075 --> 37:29.114
Aarón, you gave three
aprons out.

37:29.148 --> 37:32.851
But I'm gonna give out
just one apron.

37:39.658 --> 37:43.128
In my opinion, Aarón,

37:43.162 --> 37:48.267
neglected...
the best cook here.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.305
- Matt.
- Thank you.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.407
Backing you.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.542
- Full house, boys.
- Okay.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.911
Well...

37:59.944 --> 38:01.846
this is interesting.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.718
No!

38:08.653 --> 38:11.089
No! Two?

38:11.122 --> 38:12.691
Oh, my God!

38:12.724 --> 38:13.992
( whispering )
What?

38:14.025 --> 38:15.360
Wow!

38:20.732 --> 38:26.705
My first apron goes
to...

38:31.476 --> 38:34.213
S.J.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.388
My second apron goes
to...

38:49.494 --> 38:50.962
Cesar.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.931
- ( whispering ) Yes!
- ( whispering ) Wow!

38:59.571 --> 39:00.839
So, the good news,

39:00.872 --> 39:03.808
Matt, you're with me.

39:03.842 --> 39:09.147
Ryan, you'll be mentored
by the great Aarón Sánchez.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.082
Now, this is
where it gets interesting.

39:11.115 --> 39:14.253
Cesar and S.J.,

39:14.286 --> 39:16.187
you both have to decide

39:16.221 --> 39:20.992
if you want Aarón Sánchez
or Gordon Ramsay

39:21.025 --> 39:22.694
to be your mentor.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.396
Aarón, how many aprons
you got left?

39:24.429 --> 39:26.998
- I got five aprons left.
- Wow, still. And I've got four.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.200
Now, before we go
any further

39:29.234 --> 39:31.503
there isn't really a decision
to be made.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.906
You both wanna
become America's
next MasterChef,

39:34.939 --> 39:39.010
and I am the judge that can help
you achieve that dream.

39:39.043 --> 39:42.514
Guys, I can't argue
with this man's credentials,

39:42.547 --> 39:44.516
but what I can
tell you is

39:44.549 --> 39:46.385
I represent food with heart,

39:46.418 --> 39:50.154
and I can take you
to the title.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.158
S.J.,
what are you thinking?

39:58.062 --> 40:00.932
Gordon Ramsay!

40:00.965 --> 40:02.200
Congratulations, S.J..

40:02.233 --> 40:03.535
- Well done.
- Thank you.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.237
Okay, Cesar,
it's your turn.

40:06.271 --> 40:09.073
It's almost embarrassing
that I'm an English teacher

40:09.107 --> 40:10.475
and I'm at a loss for words

40:10.509 --> 40:12.511
at this great honor
by both chefs.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.182
I have to pick...

40:20.519 --> 40:22.253
Chef Aarón Sánchez.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.424
- Very good.
- Hmm.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.428
Congratulations
to all four of you.

40:29.461 --> 40:32.564
Get those aprons on
and get out of here.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.898
Gordon:
Well done.
Great job.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.767
Cesar:
It's an honor for me

40:35.800 --> 40:38.937
to receive my apron
from Chef Aarón Sánchez.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.773
He is a beacon
in Mexican cuisine and I want

40:41.806 --> 40:45.510
to carry that torch
for our culture.

40:45.544 --> 40:48.112
Matt:
An apron from Joe is such
an honor, at the same time,

40:48.146 --> 40:49.914
he's always intimidated me
a little bit.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.316
( cheering and applause )

40:51.350 --> 40:54.419
Gordon Ramsay is
a world ambassador of food.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.154
I wanna make him proud

40:56.187 --> 40:58.156
and I can represent Koreatown
at the same time.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.424
and I can't wait
to start cooking.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.259
The big question is

41:01.292 --> 41:02.527
did we see America's next
MasterChef tonight?

41:02.561 --> 41:05.296
Yes we did
and they're on my team.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.366
Please. Really?

41:07.399 --> 41:09.133
- Where's everyone going?
- Good night, Joe.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.135
- Good night.
- Dream on, Aarón.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.105
We came, we saw, we conquered.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.140
( all cheering )

41:18.510 --> 41:20.812
Narrator:
Next time...

41:20.845 --> 41:22.714
only nine aprons remain...

41:22.747 --> 41:25.183
This is gonna be tough.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.218
- Whoo-hoo!
- ...as the last home cooks...

41:27.251 --> 41:30.855
- Come on!
- scramble for a place
in the competition.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.524
( exhales )
That is one of

41:32.557 --> 41:34.192
the best things I've
ever tasted in this kitchen.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.660
- And...
- ( exhales )

41:35.694 --> 41:38.162
- What?
- What's he doing?

41:38.196 --> 41:40.198
... the judges
battle it out...

41:40.231 --> 41:42.300
- ( exhales )
- Joe: There is a massive

41:42.333 --> 41:43.535
decision to be made.

41:43.568 --> 41:44.736
Choose wisely.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.170
...to find America's next...

41:46.204 --> 41:47.872
The final apron
goes to...

41:47.906 --> 41:49.741
...MasterChef.
