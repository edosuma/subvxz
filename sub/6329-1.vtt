02:34.943 --> 02:37.411
Did you blow
the candles out downstairs?

02:40.183 --> 02:41.093
Yeah.

02:43.343 --> 02:44.492
Look at this.

02:44.823 --> 02:48.020
A Thanksgiving cornucopia
made of pie plates and spackle.

02:48.223 --> 02:50.214
What the heck is a cornucopia?

02:50.463 --> 02:52.340
It's like a horn of plenty.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.936
Oh, dear, can't it wait?

02:55.143 --> 02:57.611
We just finished decorating
for Halloween.

03:01.463 --> 03:03.499
- Well, good night.
- Night.

03:23.023 --> 03:24.251
Go look!

03:38.583 --> 03:41.222
Just a prank, that's all. Anton.

03:43.543 --> 03:46.535
Our little Scooter would
never do something like that.

03:46.943 --> 03:48.615
Quit calling him that baby name.

03:48.823 --> 03:53.055
Anton would not scoot his behind
off the couch if the house was on fire.

03:53.263 --> 03:56.699
God knows he didn't help me
with the Halloween decorations.

04:00.143 --> 04:03.499
Did you hear that?
I heard something downstairs.

04:03.903 --> 04:05.973
Well, the dog's out in the yard.

04:06.223 --> 04:08.612
It's probably just the cat.

04:12.063 --> 04:13.462
Well, go see!

05:08.823 --> 05:10.700
Hey, Bones.

05:19.703 --> 05:20.897
Gary?

05:48.063 --> 05:49.576
Anton?

06:07.863 --> 06:09.774
Gary, you said you...

06:11.903 --> 06:14.053
The house could burn down!

06:33.903 --> 06:34.699
Wake up!

06:35.703 --> 06:38.137
Anton, is that you?

07:06.543 --> 07:09.535
If you'd like to make a call,
hang up and try again.

07:09.743 --> 07:13.577
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

08:14.223 --> 08:16.453
Hey, Mom! We're out of milk!

08:22.143 --> 08:24.782
Mom, we're out of dog food!

08:44.222 --> 08:46.100
Murder in Bolan: A Special Report.

08:46.343 --> 08:49.574
Four bodies have been found.
The killer is still at large.

08:50.103 --> 08:51.502
Bolan is gripped with fear.

08:51.743 --> 08:53.938
The killings spread
from a postal route...

08:54.143 --> 08:57.419
...to the bowling alley and
now to our own Burger Jungle.

08:57.623 --> 08:59.534
With Halloween only one day away...

08:59.743 --> 09:03.338
...Bolan officials have set
a 9 p.m. Curfew for all teenagers.

09:26.263 --> 09:27.491
Hey. What's up, man?

09:27.783 --> 09:29.739
- What's up with you?
- I'm dry.

09:29.983 --> 09:33.055
- So?
- So why don't you bring me a dimer?

09:33.263 --> 09:36.380
This ain't Domino's, you lazy bitch.
Come over and get it.

09:36.623 --> 09:38.818
Come on, man. I'm comfortable.

09:40.543 --> 09:41.692
Hello?

09:59.423 --> 10:01.300
What's up, Anton?

10:03.583 --> 10:05.380
Nice outfit!

10:14.503 --> 10:17.734
Yeah? If your mom had teeth,
she wouldn't suck dick so well.

10:17.943 --> 10:19.262
What's your point?

10:21.143 --> 10:22.212
What's up, Anton?

10:23.183 --> 10:24.696
How's it going, brother?

10:25.103 --> 10:26.695
Nice boxers.

10:28.223 --> 10:29.576
Pass the chronic.

10:29.903 --> 10:32.258
I'm sorry, man.
This bong is cashed.

10:32.503 --> 10:34.494
You said he was holding.

10:35.023 --> 10:37.253
I didn't say what I was holding.

10:43.863 --> 10:44.773
That's messed up.

10:44.983 --> 10:49.056
I hear if you combine nutmeg and
oregano, you can get pretty wasted.

10:49.623 --> 10:51.181
All you do is smoke pot...

10:51.383 --> 10:52.702
...and watch TV all day.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.696
Don't get me wrong.
That's what life is all about.

10:55.943 --> 10:59.094
But don't you think you should
have some ambition, a goal?

10:59.543 --> 11:02.455
Yeah. I mean,
my dream life would be...

11:03.143 --> 11:07.375
...to lie around and watch TV
while some hot broad delivers me food.

11:07.943 --> 11:10.218
Until your parents
kick your oily ass out.

11:11.703 --> 11:13.773
I haven't seen my parents
in a few days.

11:14.143 --> 11:16.611
Maybe they're dead.
Party at Anton's.

11:16.903 --> 11:18.097
What are you doing?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.942
With a killer loose,
you can't rule out murder.

11:21.183 --> 11:22.172
What killer?

11:22.463 --> 11:23.862
Don't you watch the news?

11:24.263 --> 11:25.696
I hate that fucking show.

11:25.983 --> 11:28.451
Our little town is
in the national spotlight.

11:28.703 --> 11:30.182
Local mailman, iced.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.778
Barmaid at the bowling alley, iced.

11:33.023 --> 11:34.741
You haven't heard about the twins?

11:35.383 --> 11:37.851
They were jerking off
in the milkshake-maker again?

11:38.143 --> 11:42.182
Iced times two. Last night, when
they were working at Burger Jungle.

11:42.663 --> 11:44.062
Damn.

11:46.783 --> 11:48.375
Anton, here comes your woman.

11:50.103 --> 11:52.173
He's got serious problems.

12:01.383 --> 12:04.739
Molly's lived across the street
for, like, what, ever?

12:04.943 --> 12:07.298
Tell her about your
obsession with her.

12:07.543 --> 12:11.297
- Start by telling her your name.
- Yeah, man. She's waiting for you.

12:11.543 --> 12:13.056
She's not waiting for me.

12:13.303 --> 12:17.137
Would you stop being such a puss
and go, like, ask her to the dance?

12:17.503 --> 12:18.492
What dance?

12:18.703 --> 12:21.297
If you'd been to school recently,
you'd know.

12:21.543 --> 12:23.135
Halloween thing in the gym?

12:23.343 --> 12:25.811
9:00 curfew?
No trick-or-treating allowed?

12:26.063 --> 12:28.133
Dumb-ass dance is the only option.

12:28.343 --> 12:29.298
You guys going?

12:29.543 --> 12:32.341
Hell, no. Can you see us
in stupid-ass costumes?

12:32.583 --> 12:34.016
Grooving to Hanson and Jewel?

12:34.263 --> 12:36.697
What do we look like,
total losers, man?

12:39.343 --> 12:40.822
I see your point.

12:43.503 --> 12:44.902
She dropped her lyrics book.

12:45.103 --> 12:48.459
She'll catch you reading that
over her shoulder in biology.

12:48.703 --> 12:51.536
Her songs are badass.
She's like a poet or something.

12:52.023 --> 12:56.016
Go bring it back to her.
Be like a knight in shining armour.

12:56.263 --> 13:00.256
She'd be all grateful, invite me in,
offer me a drink, I'd accept.

13:00.543 --> 13:01.976
She'd rip your clothes off...

13:02.223 --> 13:05.101
...and make sweet love to you,
Red Shoe Diary-style.

13:06.543 --> 13:08.499
- Right.
- Could happen.

13:09.063 --> 13:11.099
Just go talk to her, man!

13:11.583 --> 13:14.302
Maybe she'll think you're funny
or something.

13:15.183 --> 13:16.298
You know what?

13:16.823 --> 13:18.097
I think I'm going to.

13:18.383 --> 13:20.499
You want to borrow some pants, chief?

13:21.103 --> 13:22.422
First impressions and all.

13:22.983 --> 13:23.859
You're a bud.

13:26.983 --> 13:28.336
Think he's gonna do it?

13:30.303 --> 13:31.418
So you gotta reach.

13:34.303 --> 13:36.294
You're getting Cheezy Poofs everywhere.

13:36.503 --> 13:38.494
You gotta open your mouth, man.

13:40.023 --> 13:41.661
Lookie what I found.

13:42.143 --> 13:43.292
I thought you were dry.

13:43.543 --> 13:44.453
I guess not.

13:46.943 --> 13:48.092
Fire me up.

14:22.303 --> 14:23.861
These are great.

14:38.983 --> 14:40.462
My book!

14:41.423 --> 14:42.538
Thank you so much...

14:43.063 --> 14:44.462
...for returning it.

15:07.503 --> 15:09.733
You're certain this is the right man?

15:09.983 --> 15:12.622
Well, I'll tell you,
Sister Liquor...

15:13.463 --> 15:15.055
That's LeCure.

15:15.543 --> 15:18.341
- Debi's fine.
- All right, Sister Debi.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.255
He's right here.

15:27.063 --> 15:28.178
It's gone!

15:28.943 --> 15:30.012
Shit!

15:30.623 --> 15:32.181
Missed it again.

15:35.503 --> 15:37.016
Where did it go?

15:53.023 --> 15:54.456
Beaver.

16:02.463 --> 16:03.816
Bolan.

16:09.423 --> 16:10.981
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

16:23.303 --> 16:24.816
Holy shit!

17:06.943 --> 17:07.932
Don't move!

17:08.343 --> 17:09.617
Roll over!

17:10.022 --> 17:11.297
Roll over!

17:14.903 --> 17:15.892
Anton Tobias.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.978
You got a reason
for prowling around here?

17:19.223 --> 17:20.098
I live here.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.573
Since when is it illegal
to grocery shop?

17:22.943 --> 17:24.535
Hey, I know you guys.

17:25.303 --> 17:28.101
You guys were seniors
when I was a freshman.

17:28.383 --> 17:30.055
Let's talk about high school.

17:30.263 --> 17:33.255
You and your stoner friends
zipping around on skateboards.

17:33.503 --> 17:35.141
Thought you were too cool for us.

17:35.623 --> 17:38.660
Did you even once invite us
to get high behind the gym?

17:39.463 --> 17:40.452
You were dorks.

17:46.943 --> 17:48.262
Either of you holding?

17:48.543 --> 17:49.498
What?

17:49.703 --> 17:52.661
I'm desperate. I know you can
get in the evidence room...

17:52.943 --> 17:56.253
You asshole!
You're trying to score from a cop?

17:56.503 --> 17:59.620
That's it.
Complete personal-effects search.

18:02.303 --> 18:03.179
What's this?

18:03.423 --> 18:05.778
Stupid, that's an asthma inhaler.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.016
Empty your pockets, boy.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.332
They're not my pants.

18:11.703 --> 18:12.658
Let's go!

18:19.063 --> 18:20.496
George found a new home.

18:22.823 --> 18:24.461
What have we here?

18:25.223 --> 18:26.417
Officer?

18:27.903 --> 18:29.814
Smells like marijuana to me.

18:30.063 --> 18:31.018
Write it up, Ruck.

18:31.303 --> 18:32.372
What? It's empty.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.417
You can't cite me
for possession of a baggie.

18:38.303 --> 18:39.622
Littering.

18:39.863 --> 18:41.455
Maximum fine.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.141
Two hundred dollars.

18:46.983 --> 18:47.972
Right.

21:09.343 --> 21:11.493
Oh, shit! The killer's here!

21:12.143 --> 21:13.895
The killer's in my house!

21:43.823 --> 21:45.097
Okay, Dukey.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.096
Everything's gonna be okay.
Come on, come on.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.059
Everything's going to be fine.

21:54.423 --> 21:55.902
Yes, it is.

22:17.183 --> 22:18.536
All right, boy.

22:23.423 --> 22:24.856
He's not dead!

22:35.543 --> 22:37.454
Duke! Come on, lay down!

22:37.703 --> 22:38.818
Get down, Duke!

22:40.663 --> 22:41.778
All right.

22:49.863 --> 22:51.979
Hold on, Duke. Hold on.

22:53.543 --> 22:55.499
Where's the phone?

23:03.503 --> 23:05.016
Run, Duke, run!

23:06.383 --> 23:07.213
He's under the bed!

23:20.303 --> 23:21.452
Mom?

23:25.743 --> 23:26.778
Dad?

23:44.903 --> 23:46.541
What's the matter?
Bad shrooms?

23:46.743 --> 23:49.018
You got a fever? Here you go.

23:49.543 --> 23:51.056
I'm going to show you.

23:59.223 --> 24:00.702
Oh, man!

24:02.543 --> 24:05.853
I love this video. I didn't think
they could show it anymore.

24:07.063 --> 24:07.893
Guys!

24:09.703 --> 24:11.216
Someone killed my parents!

24:11.463 --> 24:12.578
This is the best part.

24:16.303 --> 24:17.418
Shake them, baby.

24:20.943 --> 24:21.853
Look! Look!

24:23.743 --> 24:25.096
- Shit!
- Yeah, you see?

24:29.863 --> 24:30.932
Mr. Tobias?

24:31.263 --> 24:32.252
Miss T.?

24:35.983 --> 24:40.135
Is this some kind of Halloween gag?
Your parents always go all out.

24:43.103 --> 24:45.856
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my dad!

24:46.103 --> 24:48.856
CPR, man. I saw it on Baywatch.

24:57.503 --> 24:58.902
Check it out.

25:02.543 --> 25:03.896
A clue.

25:41.823 --> 25:44.132
"Ant"? They were killed by ants?

25:44.343 --> 25:46.254
Please, don't be stupid.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.016
Do you have an evil aunt?

25:49.783 --> 25:50.898
Holy shit!

25:55.263 --> 25:56.298
Are those ears?

25:57.183 --> 25:58.411
Ear rings?

25:58.943 --> 25:59.932
They're both lefts.

26:01.743 --> 26:03.381
You know what that means.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.135
Feldstein twins.

26:23.303 --> 26:25.453
The killer was wearing your shirt.

26:29.543 --> 26:31.295
The killer was wearing me.

26:35.423 --> 26:36.822
I'm the killer.

26:39.623 --> 26:42.217
I'm gonna call 911.

26:43.103 --> 26:44.331
What's the number?

26:50.303 --> 26:52.453
There's something wrong
with my friend.

26:52.663 --> 26:55.257
I think he took
some nutmeg or something.

26:59.063 --> 27:00.815
Mick, buddy.

27:01.543 --> 27:04.103
- I would remember something like that.
- You would.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.175
I'm not the killer. You know?

27:06.423 --> 27:09.972
Yeah, I know. But if O.J.
Could get off, then I'm sure...

27:11.543 --> 27:12.862
Do you want a beer?

27:13.103 --> 27:14.422
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

27:32.343 --> 27:33.571
Talk to me!

27:37.343 --> 27:39.299
What the hell is happening to me?

27:46.183 --> 27:47.457
Pnub, man.

27:48.263 --> 27:49.696
I didn't do it.

27:51.463 --> 27:54.455
Okay, I did it.
But it was an accident.

27:54.663 --> 27:56.893
I can't believe
you told me to smoke that shit!

27:57.263 --> 28:00.858
Okay, Anton.
I have to leave now.

28:01.503 --> 28:03.494
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.377
It's the basement!
You can't get out that way!

28:35.783 --> 28:37.341
Why are you doing this?

28:37.543 --> 28:38.817
I don't know!

28:39.783 --> 28:41.216
It's me, Pnub! Your buddy!

28:42.543 --> 28:45.057
I know who you are.
I don't want to hurt you.

28:45.303 --> 28:46.338
Then don't!

28:48.943 --> 28:50.137
It's not me!

28:50.383 --> 28:51.532
It's my hand!

28:51.783 --> 28:54.092
It's like I have no control
over my hand!

29:00.063 --> 29:02.338
I don't know how long
I can hold it. Run!

29:02.543 --> 29:03.692
Get out of my way!

29:03.943 --> 29:04.739
Just go!

29:07.823 --> 29:10.462
It's going to be okay.
I won't tell anybody.

29:10.743 --> 29:11.812
I swear.

29:12.343 --> 29:13.662
Everything will be cool.

29:13.903 --> 29:14.892
Everything will be...

29:27.263 --> 29:28.742
...cool.

30:07.543 --> 30:08.976
What have I done?

30:10.783 --> 30:12.375
What have I done?

31:03.623 --> 31:05.215
Get out of here, Bones!

31:06.783 --> 31:07.898
Git!

31:24.983 --> 31:26.052
Bones?

31:35.543 --> 31:36.896
Here, kitty, kitty.

32:06.583 --> 32:08.733
Aren't you a little old
for ding-dong ditch?

32:11.263 --> 32:12.981
Sorry about your bush.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.701
No problem.

32:22.223 --> 32:24.498
What were you doing out there anyway?

32:29.583 --> 32:31.778
Jesus, look at you!

32:35.703 --> 32:37.295
I was looking for my cat.

32:37.543 --> 32:38.771
We got in a fight.

32:39.703 --> 32:41.295
You sure got your ass kicked.

32:41.863 --> 32:43.455
I did okay.

32:45.223 --> 32:48.420
So you ran and hid in my bush.

32:52.143 --> 32:53.701
I shouldn't be here.

32:54.183 --> 32:55.741
I'm not myself today.

32:56.623 --> 32:58.500
I'm someone completely different.

32:59.583 --> 33:01.255
You're so shy.

33:01.503 --> 33:02.618
It's okay. I get it.

33:03.223 --> 33:06.295
So let's skip this chickening-out,
sneaking-around stage.

33:06.543 --> 33:09.455
No, you don't understand. I'm...

33:13.823 --> 33:16.178
Do you want to come inside and talk?

33:25.303 --> 33:29.057
You never gave me a chance to thank you.
That book is important to me.

33:33.663 --> 33:34.778
So...

33:35.503 --> 33:38.540
...nothing cooler than
a chick bass-guitar player.

33:39.783 --> 33:41.774
Especially one that writes
her own lyrics.

33:42.023 --> 33:43.502
You read them?

33:45.263 --> 33:48.335
I couldn't help looking in the book.
They're amazing.

33:48.583 --> 33:51.143
Look, I even got
my favourites memorized.

33:51.383 --> 33:53.055
Devil girl with nothing to lose

33:53.303 --> 33:57.501
She got wind in her hair
And gum on her shoes

34:00.543 --> 34:02.295
I was 13 when I wrote that.

34:02.543 --> 34:03.896
Yeah, well...

34:04.503 --> 34:05.538
...they're amazing.

34:05.863 --> 34:07.057
Thanks.

34:22.183 --> 34:24.458
I should not be here, Molly.

34:24.703 --> 34:28.411
Safer in here than on the streets.
There's a killer out there.

34:30.063 --> 34:33.658
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I'm dangerous.

34:34.143 --> 34:35.132
Oh, yeah?

34:35.382 --> 34:37.260
How dangerous?

34:39.183 --> 34:40.331
I'm not kidding.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.414
I've done stuff, you know?

34:52.902 --> 34:54.655
I'm impressed.

34:54.902 --> 34:58.862
I never would've thought you'd have
the balls to just grab me like that.

35:00.383 --> 35:01.611
Me either.

35:52.303 --> 35:53.861
You're kinky.

35:55.383 --> 35:56.702
That's me.

36:13.023 --> 36:15.253
Move it, people! Let's go!

36:15.503 --> 36:17.494
Some of us are
on serious missions here.

36:18.223 --> 36:21.693
There's evil out there,
and I gotta kick its ass!

36:29.143 --> 36:32.931
Shit, my parents are home.
We'll have to pick this up later.

36:33.143 --> 36:36.658
My parents might take offense to some
bloody boy banging their daughter.

36:36.863 --> 36:37.978
Tomorrow.

36:38.383 --> 36:40.499
- You want to see me?
- Come by at 7.

36:41.783 --> 36:46.095
The curfew's annihilated our options,
but we can go to the dance.

36:46.743 --> 36:48.973
I thought you said
the streets weren't safe.

36:50.223 --> 36:51.372
I'll protect you.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.262
Dearly beloved...

37:21.343 --> 37:24.301
...we're gathered here today
because you're all dead.

37:25.103 --> 37:26.741
And it's my fault.

37:28.023 --> 37:29.854
Mom, Dad...

37:30.783 --> 37:32.933
...what can I say? I mean...

37:33.503 --> 37:35.459
...you brought me into this world...

37:35.703 --> 37:39.457
...you put a roof over my head,
you fed me until I killed you.

37:41.143 --> 37:45.455
If you look at it that way, I haven't
been a good son, but I'm really...

37:45.783 --> 37:47.774
...really, really sorry.

37:48.063 --> 37:49.894
And wherever you are...

37:50.903 --> 37:53.815
...I just want you to forgive me...

37:54.303 --> 37:56.339
...because I'm gonna try to change.

38:01.703 --> 38:02.852
Mick...

38:03.103 --> 38:04.456
...Pnub, guys...

38:05.783 --> 38:09.298
You guys were the greatest.
I'm never going to forget...

38:09.503 --> 38:14.418
...the way we sat around all day,
watched TV and got really stoned.

38:14.823 --> 38:17.098
And all those other times
where we just...

38:20.903 --> 38:22.973
I guess that's all we did.

38:28.063 --> 38:29.257
Amen.

38:42.743 --> 38:44.495
Over here.

38:46.063 --> 38:47.576
Anton, help me.

38:49.023 --> 38:52.095
Come on, man.
I can't breathe down here.

38:58.743 --> 39:00.813
Anton, can you hear me?

39:02.183 --> 39:03.332
Yeah, man, Mick.

39:03.583 --> 39:05.539
Now get me out of here.

39:06.703 --> 39:07.852
You're dead.

39:08.063 --> 39:08.859
No, I'm not.

39:09.063 --> 39:12.692
You conked my head pretty good.
I must've been unconscious.

39:14.703 --> 39:17.376
- You think?
- I know, fucker. Now dig me up!

39:27.143 --> 39:28.781
Stay where you are, Mick!

40:08.823 --> 40:09.938
Please don't kill me.

40:12.783 --> 40:13.818
Watch it, man!

40:33.383 --> 40:35.214
What did I take last night?

40:37.423 --> 40:39.459
That dream was intense.

40:41.263 --> 40:42.776
Intense.

40:49.263 --> 40:51.857
- Turn it up. Check it out.
- Yeah, I'm watching.

40:53.183 --> 40:54.013
Did you see?

40:54.263 --> 40:55.378
- Guys!
- That's funny.

40:55.623 --> 40:59.172
Thank God you're alive, because
I had this dream that I killed...

41:05.703 --> 41:06.977
Shit!

41:09.303 --> 41:11.180
Sorry about that thing
with the shovel.

41:11.943 --> 41:13.740
- You're dead.
- Easy, tiger.

41:14.183 --> 41:15.855
Undead, actually.

41:16.103 --> 41:18.219
You said you were unconscious.
You lied.

41:18.463 --> 41:22.012
You killed me, all right?
Try and keep this thing in perspective.

41:22.263 --> 41:25.221
I was bitter about the
getting-killed-by-my-best-friend thing.

41:25.423 --> 41:26.856
But I got over it.

41:39.543 --> 41:40.862
So why you here?

41:41.063 --> 41:42.462
We need a place to kick it.

41:42.703 --> 41:45.376
Don't be selfish.
No one else's parents are dead.

41:45.783 --> 41:48.172
No, not why are you "here" here.
I mean...

41:48.423 --> 41:51.972
...are you flesh-eating zombies
back from hell to exact revenge?

41:52.263 --> 41:53.537
Is that it?

41:53.823 --> 41:55.734
Why would we go to hell?

41:55.983 --> 41:56.779
We're not bad.

41:57.023 --> 42:00.413
It's not like we're good,
but at least we don't kill people!

42:00.783 --> 42:02.660
I didn't kill anybody on purpose.

42:03.383 --> 42:05.339
Yeah, well, we weren't in hell.

42:05.583 --> 42:08.495
There was this bright light
at the end of a long tunnel.

42:08.743 --> 42:11.780
There were all these chicks' voices.
And that music.

42:12.063 --> 42:12.893
Music?

42:13.183 --> 42:15.743
Kind of uncool music, like Enya.

42:15.983 --> 42:17.575
And these chicks were saying...

42:17.823 --> 42:20.542
..." Come to us.
Come towards the light."

42:23.143 --> 42:24.462
So what happened?

42:24.783 --> 42:26.262
We figured, fuck it.

42:26.503 --> 42:28.300
I mean, it was really far.

42:34.223 --> 42:36.373
I've got to ask.
What's with the hand?

42:38.903 --> 42:40.655
It doesn't obey me at all.

42:40.943 --> 42:44.060
The only thing I can come up with is,
it's possessed.

42:45.223 --> 42:48.260
Do you guys know anything
about Satan or evil or...?

42:48.983 --> 42:49.813
No.

42:52.023 --> 42:53.854
But we know somebody who does.

43:24.983 --> 43:26.177
Did you know them well?

43:27.023 --> 43:28.695
Not really.

43:29.103 --> 43:30.138
You?

43:31.103 --> 43:33.139
Yeah, they were great.

43:33.383 --> 43:37.615
I just feel really bad, you know,
because I was always so mean to them.

43:38.743 --> 43:42.452
Like this one time, they asked me
to go on a double-date...

43:42.703 --> 43:46.298
...and I thought they were 'tards,
because there's only one of me.

43:46.983 --> 43:49.861
So I told them to go blow each other.

43:53.143 --> 43:54.132
Did they?

43:59.943 --> 44:01.171
The way you treated them...

44:01.423 --> 44:04.017
...the guilt must be making you feel
like shit inside.

44:04.823 --> 44:05.778
Randy!

44:06.023 --> 44:07.775
You're still in high school?

44:08.023 --> 44:10.537
Yeah, me, I got out
about three years ago.

44:10.783 --> 44:12.102
I need your help.

44:13.063 --> 44:15.372
What are you playing,
a little two-ball?

44:16.263 --> 44:19.335
I gotta talk to you.
There's serious stuff going on.

44:19.583 --> 44:23.053
Anton, can't you see I'm getting
a little action over here?

44:27.503 --> 44:30.859
Oh, man. I can't believe
you cock-blocked me like that.

44:31.103 --> 44:33.059
I thought we were buds.

44:33.783 --> 44:34.613
Randy, wait!

44:35.583 --> 44:37.539
I didn't mean to mess you up.
Listen.

44:37.783 --> 44:39.341
I need your help.

44:43.223 --> 44:44.451
Piss off!

45:00.463 --> 45:02.374
Fresh tomatoes...

45:04.023 --> 45:05.422
Hey! Who are you?

45:05.783 --> 45:07.580
New. Drive-thru duty.

45:07.823 --> 45:08.972
Excuse me.

45:10.343 --> 45:11.412
Sorry.

45:22.263 --> 45:24.060
- Break time.
- All right.

45:24.863 --> 45:27.616
Give me the Big Five with
the Spicy Safari Fries...

45:27.863 --> 45:29.854
...the African Apple Turnover...

45:30.103 --> 45:32.014
...and the Raspberry Rainforest Shake.

45:32.263 --> 45:34.731
Slap some extra mustard
on that Jungle Burger.

45:34.983 --> 45:37.178
Tell me everything you know
about the devil.

45:38.983 --> 45:40.814
Are you out of your fucking mind?

45:41.863 --> 45:45.173
You listen to satanic music.
You must've picked up something.

45:45.423 --> 45:47.937
Look, it's just music.

45:48.863 --> 45:50.854
Like Mozart and that other fag...

45:52.543 --> 45:53.532
Keep it clean.

45:54.543 --> 45:55.862
Who, Beethoven?

45:56.143 --> 45:59.260
That's the guy. It's just like
their music, only louder.

45:59.503 --> 46:00.982
You gotta know.
I'm desperate.

46:01.223 --> 46:02.497
Oh, man!

46:05.863 --> 46:07.012
Here!

46:07.383 --> 46:08.702
Asshole!

46:11.903 --> 46:14.895
It's my hand. It's like it's got
a mind of its own.

46:15.103 --> 46:17.492
It makes me do things
I don't want it to do.

46:18.183 --> 46:19.457
I used to be like that.

46:19.703 --> 46:22.012
Get into all kinds of stupid shit.

46:22.263 --> 46:23.332
Look, the trick is...

46:23.703 --> 46:25.295
...to keep yourself busy.

46:25.543 --> 46:27.738
That's why I'm always
working on the Ford.

46:27.943 --> 46:29.820
Keeps me out of trouble.

46:30.063 --> 46:33.055
Idle hands are the devil's playground.

46:33.583 --> 46:35.301
Keep my hands busy.

46:36.023 --> 46:38.776
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

46:39.063 --> 46:40.291
Thanks.
You're the coolest.

46:55.063 --> 46:56.576
So do you, like, knit now?

46:56.823 --> 47:00.099
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look queer doing that.

47:00.343 --> 47:02.334
Randy broke it down for me.

47:02.943 --> 47:05.696
"Idle hands are the devil's playpen."
So I'm thinking...

47:06.303 --> 47:08.498
...keep my hands occupied, right?

47:08.863 --> 47:11.138
Man, that saying's not literal.

47:11.383 --> 47:12.657
It's more like...

47:13.503 --> 47:14.299
...you know...

47:14.903 --> 47:16.097
Metaphorical?

47:16.623 --> 47:17.738
Right.

47:30.503 --> 47:32.334
This is the noise complaint.

47:33.143 --> 47:34.895
Ain't this the Tobias residence?

47:42.383 --> 47:44.658
Holy shit! It's Anton.
He's the killer!

47:44.903 --> 47:47.133
- I better call for backup.
- Are you crazy?

47:47.383 --> 47:50.853
And let the feds get the credit?
If we collar him, we'll be heroes.

47:51.063 --> 47:52.621
We can't go in without a warrant.

47:52.863 --> 47:54.979
Piss on the Bill of Rights!
We got just cause.

47:56.183 --> 47:57.377
Freeze!

47:57.623 --> 47:58.851
Yeah, freeze!

48:03.743 --> 48:04.539
Guys...

48:04.863 --> 48:05.773
...what do I do?

48:06.903 --> 48:08.097
I think you...

48:13.183 --> 48:15.492
I was gonna say to do
what they tell you...

48:15.783 --> 48:17.136
...but now I changed my mind.

48:17.383 --> 48:18.941
You should just kill them.

48:20.623 --> 48:22.022
- They're alive!
- They are not!

48:22.223 --> 48:24.339
You shot one in the head!
They're morgue-meat.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.742
Look, guys. I don't want
to kill anybody else.

48:29.423 --> 48:31.459
You don't want to go to jail, though.

48:31.783 --> 48:34.138
Jail. That's it!

48:34.383 --> 48:37.659
They'll throw me in a rubber room.
I can't hurt anybody else.

48:37.903 --> 48:39.177
Cuff me!

48:39.703 --> 48:41.580
Okay. Just...

48:43.263 --> 48:44.901
...drop the knitting needles.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.301
That's not a good idea.
Why don't you just cuff me?

48:48.783 --> 48:51.661
Drop the needles
and put your hands on your head!

48:51.903 --> 48:52.938
I can't!

48:53.423 --> 48:55.493
Put down the needles
and come quietly.

48:55.743 --> 48:58.052
- Cuff me!
- Put the needles down now!

48:58.343 --> 48:59.935
- Cuff me!
- Put them down!

49:00.223 --> 49:01.576
- Put them down!
- Cuff me!

49:30.983 --> 49:32.018
Go, go, Buffalo!

49:35.343 --> 49:36.458
Stop!

49:37.223 --> 49:39.020
I didn't do it. It was my hand.

49:39.303 --> 49:41.897
It's like, the knitting
didn't help at all.

49:42.143 --> 49:45.021
I told you that saying
was more, like, metaphorical.

49:53.583 --> 49:55.778
I can't keep doing this!

49:57.623 --> 49:59.102
I'm losing my mind.

50:14.183 --> 50:15.741
Get your head.

50:24.783 --> 50:26.455
No way.

50:27.223 --> 50:29.179
It's the only thing I can think of.

50:29.503 --> 50:32.734
Once that hand is gone,
how will you cut off the other one?

50:32.983 --> 50:34.257
The left one's a keeper.

50:34.503 --> 50:36.698
I mean, I guess it wasn't idle enough.

50:37.383 --> 50:38.372
Are you sure?

50:39.423 --> 50:43.302
I use it for a lot of things.
I light up, I change the remote...

50:43.823 --> 50:45.814
...I relieve a little tension.

50:46.303 --> 50:48.259
This is the answer. I know it.

50:49.423 --> 50:51.175
Those things won't even cut my bagel.

50:54.103 --> 50:55.172
Shit!

51:02.183 --> 51:03.093
Grab the carver.

51:08.863 --> 51:10.057
Look at me!

51:10.303 --> 51:12.055
I'm Leatherface!

51:14.183 --> 51:15.138
Thanks, Mick.

51:18.303 --> 51:20.180
I'll just use this one.

51:21.463 --> 51:22.896
I can't watch.

51:43.103 --> 51:44.058
You missed.

51:45.143 --> 51:46.098
Pnub...

51:47.183 --> 51:48.218
...bite down.

51:48.583 --> 51:49.857
Don't cut me, man!

52:00.103 --> 52:01.821
You scream like a girl.

52:04.743 --> 52:06.176
What the hell are you doing?

52:09.703 --> 52:12.137
I gotta stop the blood flow.
Don't you watch ER?

52:13.943 --> 52:17.731
Look at that nasty thing.
That's gonna be infected for sure.

52:17.983 --> 52:19.860
You got any antiseptic, Anton?

52:20.103 --> 52:21.092
I don't know.

52:21.343 --> 52:24.176
Pnub's got some in a first-aid kit
in his house.

52:24.463 --> 52:25.532
And burritos.

52:26.183 --> 52:27.582
You'll be okay, buddy.

52:27.823 --> 52:30.291
We'll be back in a sec
to fix you up, Anton.

52:36.343 --> 52:37.298
Catch you on the flip-flop.

52:56.183 --> 52:57.298
Oh, shit!

53:17.463 --> 53:19.294
Anton, are you home?

53:22.943 --> 53:25.059
Don't come in!
Just stay there, okay?

53:25.823 --> 53:27.381
Very funny, Anton.

53:27.623 --> 53:29.102
Stay out there, Molly!

53:29.423 --> 53:31.220
I'm freezing my butt off.

53:46.103 --> 53:47.821
Anton, we're gonna be late.

53:54.703 --> 53:56.375
Anton, I can hear you in there!

53:56.623 --> 53:58.261
Stay outside!

53:59.383 --> 54:01.180
Come on, Anton!

54:07.583 --> 54:09.574
Let's go!
We're gonna be late!

54:21.623 --> 54:23.215
We're gonna miss the band.

54:29.183 --> 54:30.298
Fry!

54:35.223 --> 54:36.417
Gross.

54:36.863 --> 54:38.660
Anton, I'm coming in.

54:43.143 --> 54:43.939
Wait!

54:53.783 --> 54:55.182
You look incredible.

54:55.383 --> 54:57.260
Thanks. But you should've called.

54:57.463 --> 55:00.978
If you needed more time with your
costume, fine. But I hate waiting.

55:01.343 --> 55:03.618
So what are you supposed
to be, anyway?

55:06.303 --> 55:07.179
I'm...

55:07.943 --> 55:11.015
...a fast-food employee that
cut off his own hand.

55:11.543 --> 55:12.339
Cute.

55:19.103 --> 55:20.092
Come on!

55:23.863 --> 55:25.421
Anton, we're back!

55:26.183 --> 55:29.175
We got antiseptic
and adhesive bandages!

55:29.383 --> 55:31.101
The ouch-free kind!

55:35.823 --> 55:39.213
"Microwave for three minutes
and enjoy."

55:40.063 --> 55:41.974
That's really getting on my nerves.

55:52.463 --> 55:54.135
What are you doing?

55:56.183 --> 55:57.093
Could you...?

55:57.383 --> 55:58.452
This way.

55:58.783 --> 55:59.772
Easy.

56:03.543 --> 56:05.261
Yeah. That's better.

56:08.383 --> 56:09.452
All right.

56:14.623 --> 56:15.851
Thanks, man!

56:20.463 --> 56:21.691
Gross!

56:22.383 --> 56:24.294
Maybe we should clean it first.

56:24.503 --> 56:28.382
Hey, yeah! And while we're at it,
we can clean the whole house.

56:28.583 --> 56:30.141
This ain't our mess.

56:48.943 --> 56:52.697
Look, I can't go to the dance yet,
okay? I'm sorry.

56:53.303 --> 56:55.817
My parents will be home
in a few minutes.

56:56.023 --> 56:58.617
If they see the mess I made,
they'll kill me.

56:59.343 --> 57:01.379
Look, I won't be too long.

57:01.623 --> 57:02.942
I'll meet you there.

57:04.303 --> 57:05.702
Is something wrong?

57:05.903 --> 57:07.575
You need to go there now...

57:07.783 --> 57:12.140
...and you can't stop till you're
inside with everyone else, okay?

57:12.583 --> 57:14.414
You wouldn't stand me up, would you?

57:15.383 --> 57:17.453
Not a chance, babysnakes.

57:25.383 --> 57:27.021
I'll get the next one.

57:34.463 --> 57:36.294
Shit! I bit my tongue.

57:43.663 --> 57:44.698
That's disgusting.

57:48.863 --> 57:50.740
I bet I can fix that for you.

58:02.543 --> 58:03.453
Hold still.

58:06.503 --> 58:07.777
That's better.

58:08.503 --> 58:10.334
Burrito, burrito

58:12.583 --> 58:14.778
Wait, wait! Don't open it!

58:16.343 --> 58:17.822
I'm sorry, there were only two.

58:18.063 --> 58:20.338
No! You let the hand out!

58:22.103 --> 58:24.173
We brought you a first-aid kit.

58:25.543 --> 58:28.216
- Where did it go?
- What? You mean the hand?

58:28.463 --> 58:29.498
Of course, the hand.

58:31.383 --> 58:33.453
Try looking up your ass.

58:47.383 --> 58:48.498
Damn.

59:15.303 --> 59:16.099
Hey, foxy.

59:17.423 --> 59:18.458
Looking for a ball?

59:18.663 --> 59:22.451
Because I could help you find one
that's the right size for you.

59:23.383 --> 59:24.418
What the hell?

59:24.663 --> 59:25.982
Try and keep up.

59:26.383 --> 59:29.102
I'd be happy to keep up
with you, sweet thing.

59:32.303 --> 59:33.975
Don't you have a dance to go to?

59:34.623 --> 59:37.137
That's right.
We gotta do our costumes.

59:37.343 --> 59:39.698
- You coming, Randy?
- No.

59:39.943 --> 59:41.820
I think I can find myself a ride.

59:42.063 --> 59:43.257
All right.

59:46.503 --> 59:48.300
So what brings you to Bolan?

59:50.063 --> 59:51.337
You don't want to know.

59:51.783 --> 59:54.377
No, seriously.
I'm interested.

59:54.583 --> 59:55.732
Really?

59:58.623 --> 01:00:00.102
Here it goes.

01:00:01.023 --> 01:00:04.652
I'm a Druidic priestess sworn
to fight a certain evil force...

01:00:04.903 --> 01:00:07.736
...that possesses the laziest
fuckup it can find.

01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:10.497
It will kill as many people
as possible...

01:00:10.743 --> 01:00:13.860
...and then drag a free soul
into the Netherworld.

01:00:16.143 --> 01:00:18.259
That's some weighty shit there.

01:00:18.703 --> 01:00:19.818
Here's the kicker.

01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:23.339
I have the one thing
that can stop this from happening.

01:00:24.343 --> 01:00:27.176
I just need to find the bastard
whose hand is possessed.

01:00:27.823 --> 01:00:28.858
Weird.

01:00:29.103 --> 01:00:33.096
Earlier today, this guy, Anton,
told me his hand was doing stuff...

01:00:33.343 --> 01:00:35.334
...that he didn't want it to do.

01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:37.702
Don't you fuck with me!

01:00:37.943 --> 01:00:39.501
Ease up, there, kitten.

01:00:39.743 --> 01:00:42.701
I'm telling you the truth.
This guy was freaked!

01:00:43.143 --> 01:00:44.735
Show me where he lives.

01:00:57.303 --> 01:00:59.533
Left! Turn left!

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:22.616
Guys! We gotta go to the dance.

01:01:23.863 --> 01:01:25.262
The hand, it's after Molly.

01:01:25.903 --> 01:01:28.258
Let's check out the dance.
I'll win Best Costume.

01:01:28.503 --> 01:01:31.461
Chicks dig winners.
I'll probably hook up.

01:01:31.703 --> 01:01:35.776
Yeah, because severed heads are
one of the top 10 big turn-ons.

01:01:37.503 --> 01:01:40.063
It kills me to see you stressed out.

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:43.380
You cut off your hand
in the interest of others.

01:01:43.623 --> 01:01:44.772
It's not your problem anymore.

01:01:45.103 --> 01:01:48.812
So what I want you to do
is take a little Anton-time.

01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:52.332
Just relax and kick back, my man.

01:01:52.783 --> 01:01:54.341
No, no. You know what?

01:01:56.943 --> 01:01:57.978
Not this time, okay?

01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:01.452
I'm through with that.
All I do is sit around.

01:02:01.663 --> 01:02:04.223
I veg out, I watch TV,
I smoke pot...

01:02:04.423 --> 01:02:06.937
No Kevin Costner speeches.
Let's just go.

01:02:11.503 --> 01:02:12.538
Come on!

01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:22.982
Let's go! Come on, come on!

01:02:23.183 --> 01:02:24.457
That's him!

01:02:25.023 --> 01:02:28.060
- They're getting into my Ford!
- Wait here. He's dangerous.

01:02:28.463 --> 01:02:31.057
Wait.
Don't let him steal my Ford.

01:02:31.303 --> 01:02:33.055
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:36.223 --> 01:02:37.338
That's lucky.

01:02:38.383 --> 01:02:39.452
Shit.

01:02:39.703 --> 01:02:41.341
Couldn't be automatic.

01:02:42.263 --> 01:02:43.059
Want me to drive?

01:02:43.303 --> 01:02:44.531
No, just shift for me.

01:02:52.343 --> 01:02:53.935
Anton! Wait!

01:03:03.343 --> 01:03:04.412
What was that?

01:03:04.663 --> 01:03:05.652
Who cares?

01:03:17.063 --> 01:03:18.496
Get back here!

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:46.739
Who's got the barf breath?

01:04:09.103 --> 01:04:11.173
Damn!
It's hot in here.

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:13.736
So are you, babe.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.936
I'm sweating my costume off, Curtis.

01:04:23.703 --> 01:04:24.772
Better?

01:04:38.303 --> 01:04:40.055
Help me get this off.

01:04:59.183 --> 01:05:00.901
Right there.

01:05:40.623 --> 01:05:41.612
It's here.

01:05:42.463 --> 01:05:44.419
You guys go protect Molly.

01:05:44.743 --> 01:05:45.971
I'll go after the hand.

01:05:48.623 --> 01:05:50.693
- What a waste.
- You didn't like Curtis.

01:05:50.903 --> 01:05:52.655
I'm talking about that ass!

01:05:52.903 --> 01:05:54.621
Well, at least he died happy.

01:06:20.623 --> 01:06:21.976
What's bugging you?

01:06:22.223 --> 01:06:23.576
Just thinking.

01:06:24.303 --> 01:06:25.816
And I know who about.

01:06:26.303 --> 01:06:28.021
Just thought he'd be here by now.

01:06:28.863 --> 01:06:30.376
He'll be here.

01:06:32.743 --> 01:06:35.177
I'll go get some punch.
You want some?

01:06:35.943 --> 01:06:37.501
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:07:02.223 --> 01:07:04.054
You guys look great!

01:07:04.823 --> 01:07:06.461
Who did your makeup?

01:07:07.943 --> 01:07:11.015
- I guess Anton did.
- Based on my design, though.

01:07:12.023 --> 01:07:12.899
You want to dance?

01:07:13.183 --> 01:07:14.093
Hell, yeah!

01:07:17.143 --> 01:07:19.134
- We should find Molly.
- Quit being a skirt.

01:07:19.343 --> 01:07:22.733
We'll look for her while we dance.
There's plenty of chicks here.

01:07:23.423 --> 01:07:25.732
- Careful, it's on kind of loose.
- Cool!

01:07:50.023 --> 01:07:53.333
Don't put me on hold again.
I want to talk to your supervisor.

01:07:53.743 --> 01:07:54.732
What?

01:07:55.543 --> 01:07:57.295
Yes, of course.

01:08:00.663 --> 01:08:03.496
What's taking so long?
Is this the supervisor?

01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:07.137
What do you mean
my credit card is no good?

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.972
Well, you must have
the wrong number.

01:08:10.783 --> 01:08:13.422
No, it's 8-4-6-8.

01:08:20.303 --> 01:08:21.417
That's good.

01:08:22.582 --> 01:08:25.176
I think you've been a bad girl...

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:29.412
...and I want to spank you
with my ruler.

01:08:31.223 --> 01:08:32.861
Oh, yes, that's nice.

01:08:33.263 --> 01:08:34.491
That is nice.

01:08:36.983 --> 01:08:38.211
Now I'm hot.

01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:40.221
I'm hot.

01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:44.979
You got me so hot, it's like
I can feel you touching me.

01:08:49.023 --> 01:08:51.139
I can feel you touching me.

01:09:17.983 --> 01:09:19.018
Bingo!

01:09:31.502 --> 01:09:33.698
Come on! We got to find Anton!

01:09:34.943 --> 01:09:36.535
And kick his ass!

01:09:55.703 --> 01:09:57.056
Are you Anton?

01:09:57.303 --> 01:10:00.056
If you're a teacher,
we'll discuss my attendance later...

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:02.219
I found you!
My name is Debi LeCure.

01:10:02.463 --> 01:10:04.738
I know what's happening.
I could stop it.

01:10:05.623 --> 01:10:06.453
Really, how?

01:10:08.823 --> 01:10:09.619
Die!

01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:22.457
Yeah, fuck him up, Debi!

01:10:24.023 --> 01:10:25.900
The host of evil must die!

01:10:31.023 --> 01:10:33.014
Isn't that knife
a little extreme, kitten?

01:10:44.983 --> 01:10:49.579
You're not going anywhere, evil-hosting
fuck-stick. Nobody touches my Ford!

01:10:50.023 --> 01:10:50.819
Come on, Debi.

01:10:51.063 --> 01:10:51.973
Give him what for.

01:10:52.263 --> 01:10:53.696
Wait, wait! I'm not a host.

01:10:54.023 --> 01:10:55.138
Okay, look.

01:10:55.423 --> 01:10:57.414
The evil was in my hand, all right?

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:01.055
I cut it off. Okay?

01:11:02.983 --> 01:11:03.733
Oh, shit!

01:11:03.943 --> 01:11:05.217
You let it loose?

01:11:05.463 --> 01:11:07.181
That was probably a mistake.

01:11:07.423 --> 01:11:10.415
No kidding. And now it's
after my girlfriend.

01:11:10.623 --> 01:11:12.375
- You got a girlfriend?
- I gotta stop it.

01:11:12.623 --> 01:11:15.342
- It's out for blood.
- That ain't all it's out for.

01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:18.381
If your girl's the one it's after,
then at midnight...

01:11:18.623 --> 01:11:20.261
...it's taking her to hell.

01:11:20.503 --> 01:11:21.936
Hell?

01:11:23.303 --> 01:11:25.897
It's not even 9:00 yet.
We got some time.

01:11:27.143 --> 01:11:27.939
It's actually...

01:11:29.183 --> 01:11:32.061
...six minutes till midnight,
druid time.

01:11:32.943 --> 01:11:34.296
Druid time.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.453
Right.

01:11:35.663 --> 01:11:36.459
Let's go!

01:11:44.863 --> 01:11:45.932
Oh, God!

01:11:46.223 --> 01:11:47.497
That's disgusting.

01:11:48.063 --> 01:11:50.861
Come on, man. You're dead.

01:11:51.103 --> 01:11:53.981
You know, think about it.
It's illegal.

01:12:17.623 --> 01:12:19.136
Move! Look out!

01:12:24.783 --> 01:12:27.456
Everybody, go home!
There's a psycho killer here!

01:12:37.903 --> 01:12:40.133
I cut off my hand,
and it'll kill you all.

01:12:40.343 --> 01:12:41.776
Get off the stage!

01:12:45.303 --> 01:12:47.692
It's true.
His hand killed us yesterday.

01:12:47.943 --> 01:12:50.173
Yeah, it sliced me up real good.

01:12:50.543 --> 01:12:52.852
- Molly, you out there?
- Get out of here, kid!

01:12:54.423 --> 01:12:56.937
You had your fun!
Now it's time...

01:13:07.023 --> 01:13:08.012
Shit!

01:13:32.743 --> 01:13:36.099
- God! Did you see that thing?
- I have to get Anton!

01:13:36.343 --> 01:13:39.335
No, screw him!
I mean, he'll be fine!

01:13:41.503 --> 01:13:42.492
Come on!

01:13:45.143 --> 01:13:46.098
In there?

01:13:46.343 --> 01:13:49.653
You want to stay out here and
get killed as you're trampled?

01:13:55.703 --> 01:13:57.534
I was going to get some.

01:13:58.383 --> 01:14:00.260
I really doubt it.

01:14:07.063 --> 01:14:09.497
Pnub's a lot more creative
than I thought.

01:14:09.703 --> 01:14:11.853
I mean, he's actually kind of cool.

01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:14.737
- He had that costume...
- Maybe we should go faster.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.575
I don't know if he did it or...

01:14:16.823 --> 01:14:18.541
- Wait, wait!
- What, what...?

01:14:20.943 --> 01:14:21.853
Go!

01:14:31.263 --> 01:14:33.572
Oh, shit! We're trapped in here!

01:14:33.823 --> 01:14:36.257
- It's going to get me!
- It's not going to get you!

01:14:36.503 --> 01:14:38.380
It's not going to get you!

01:14:42.743 --> 01:14:45.815
We can't go through the blade!
We'll be pulverized!

01:14:46.063 --> 01:14:47.416
Give me your shoe!

01:15:16.623 --> 01:15:18.375
What are you going to do?

01:15:20.783 --> 01:15:23.377
No, no.
Oh, God, it's too far!

01:15:23.623 --> 01:15:25.500
I can't drop that far!

01:15:26.463 --> 01:15:27.816
We'll die in this vent!

01:15:28.063 --> 01:15:29.815
- We won't die.
- We'll die here.

01:15:30.063 --> 01:15:33.738
The rats are gonna eat us,
and nobody's gonna find us.

01:15:35.903 --> 01:15:37.222
Okay, we're good.

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:43.253
- Be careful.
- All right, let's go!

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:52.575
This would be more comfortable
if your ass wasn't so wide.

01:15:52.823 --> 01:15:54.939
- This is dumb.
- Anton needs our help.

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:58.220
The best thing about being dead
is zero responsibility.

01:15:58.463 --> 01:16:00.738
That's Tanya. Let's save her.
Come on!

01:16:02.503 --> 01:16:05.859
- Hurry up. She needs me.
- She needs you like a fish needs...

01:16:10.583 --> 01:16:12.414
Okay, this sucks.

01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:19.981
Grab the cord and come down!

01:16:20.623 --> 01:16:23.296
I can't. I can't. I'm scared!

01:16:23.783 --> 01:16:25.375
Do it, Tanya! Come on!

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.375
I can't. It's here.

01:16:27.623 --> 01:16:29.215
It's in here. I know it.

01:16:30.543 --> 01:16:32.261
Why'd you pull the rope up?

01:16:33.143 --> 01:16:35.020
I didn't pull the rope up.

01:16:38.063 --> 01:16:40.133
Tanya, where are you?
I can't see you!

01:16:40.743 --> 01:16:42.335
Tanya, talk to me, please!

01:16:42.583 --> 01:16:44.016
Just jump! Just jump!

01:16:48.543 --> 01:16:50.738
Tanya, grab the rope!

01:16:52.023 --> 01:16:52.899
Get it off!

01:17:24.383 --> 01:17:27.978
I'm not going through all this Tanya.
Go back that way.

01:17:29.343 --> 01:17:31.811
- Now you really won't get any.
- It's unfair.

01:17:32.063 --> 01:17:34.577
You can go back if you want
to get a piece.

01:18:05.103 --> 01:18:06.536
Fucking hand, I got you now!

01:18:44.103 --> 01:18:45.422
Who's your daddy now, bitch?

01:18:46.663 --> 01:18:47.812
Who's your fucking...

01:18:51.023 --> 01:18:52.854
We're here for you.
Don't worry.

01:18:55.143 --> 01:18:56.781
- I made that ashtray!
- Really?

01:18:57.023 --> 01:18:58.297
You let it go again!

01:18:58.783 --> 01:18:59.579
Fuck you, then.

01:18:59.823 --> 01:19:01.381
Fine, then! You know what?

01:19:01.623 --> 01:19:03.341
You aren't crashing at my house.

01:19:03.583 --> 01:19:04.982
Did you guys hear that?

01:19:09.903 --> 01:19:11.495
Help! Help!

01:19:17.143 --> 01:19:18.292
Help me!

01:19:26.983 --> 01:19:28.894
Bet she wins Best Costume.

01:19:29.703 --> 01:19:30.738
Help me!

01:19:34.463 --> 01:19:35.737
The hand's raising the car!

01:19:37.623 --> 01:19:38.817
Help me!

01:19:40.303 --> 01:19:42.214
Don't worry. We got it under control!

01:19:42.463 --> 01:19:43.737
The fucker's got a grip.

01:19:50.023 --> 01:19:51.422
Hurry, please!

01:19:57.503 --> 01:20:00.654
Those auto-shop boys
are true artistes.

01:20:02.543 --> 01:20:04.261
It's Mighty Joe Bong!

01:20:05.903 --> 01:20:06.972
I needs me spinach.

01:20:11.183 --> 01:20:12.411
I made that.

01:20:12.703 --> 01:20:15.536
The ashtray, I'd almost believe.
But this? No way.

01:20:20.143 --> 01:20:22.452
Molly's about to get squished,
you bastards!

01:20:22.703 --> 01:20:25.092
This is important. For strength.

01:20:36.863 --> 01:20:38.057
There you go.

01:20:39.823 --> 01:20:41.575
Now you're taking Anton-time.

01:20:42.343 --> 01:20:45.813
You're getting stoned with
your friends? Unbelievable!

01:21:17.223 --> 01:21:19.054
That's some one-hit shit there!

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:21.139
Don't worry.

01:21:21.703 --> 01:21:22.499
I'll get you down.

01:21:48.463 --> 01:21:49.259
That's it?

01:21:51.023 --> 01:21:54.060
That's it?
No explosions, no hellfire, no...?

01:21:56.063 --> 01:21:57.382
I'm glad everyone's all right.

01:21:57.623 --> 01:21:59.261
But that was weak.

01:21:59.783 --> 01:22:01.694
Well, my work here is done.

01:22:01.943 --> 01:22:04.616
Time for the ritualistic sex.
You coming?

01:22:05.823 --> 01:22:07.814
You are a pistol.

01:22:09.743 --> 01:22:11.938
Hello? I'm still up here.

01:22:15.103 --> 01:22:16.297
Thanks, Mick.

01:22:17.543 --> 01:22:18.771
You're a bud.

01:22:34.743 --> 01:22:35.812
Come here.

01:22:47.703 --> 01:22:48.579
As usual...

01:22:48.823 --> 01:22:52.054
...marijuana saves
an otherwise disastrous day.

01:22:58.063 --> 01:23:00.099
I never got a hit. Light me.

01:23:10.143 --> 01:23:11.656
Sweet Jesus!

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:13.336
That wasn't my fault!

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:16.177
That thing should've come down
a lot slower!

01:23:26.583 --> 01:23:27.982
What the hell.

01:23:28.183 --> 01:23:29.377
Don't forget my bong.

01:23:29.623 --> 01:23:31.534
You did not make that bong.

01:23:31.783 --> 01:23:32.772
I arc welded it.

01:23:32.983 --> 01:23:34.132
You don't take auto shop.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.742
Fuck you!

01:23:37.303 --> 01:23:38.895
You coming, Anton?

01:23:54.023 --> 01:23:55.536
I can't even believe it.

01:23:55.783 --> 01:23:58.138
You blew off heaven
to kick it with me.

01:23:58.343 --> 01:23:59.378
You are the coolest.

01:23:59.583 --> 01:24:02.973
You taking care of me
beats the shit out of heaven.

01:24:03.183 --> 01:24:03.979
Really?

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.576
Time for your meds.

01:24:17.703 --> 01:24:19.933
Guys! You blew off heaven too?

01:24:20.223 --> 01:24:22.498
No, we're your guardian angels.

01:24:23.783 --> 01:24:26.581
Poor thing has delirium.
Visiting hours are over.

01:24:29.743 --> 01:24:31.495
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

01:24:37.783 --> 01:24:40.172
So the deal is,
we're supposed to monitor you...

01:24:40.383 --> 01:24:42.977
...and make sure you don't revert
to your evil ways.

01:24:43.183 --> 01:24:44.935
But you seem fine now.

01:24:45.183 --> 01:24:48.459
Let's hit the Snack Master in the hall.
You want anything?

01:24:48.703 --> 01:24:50.978
Get me Crunch Nuggets.
They're awesome.

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.695
Thanks, you guys.

01:25:00.423 --> 01:25:01.572
Hit the light.

01:25:10.543 --> 01:25:13.296
Mick! Pnub!
Come guardian me!

01:25:19.063 --> 01:25:21.497
You're right.
Anton screams like a girl.

01:25:21.823 --> 01:25:24.257
Think we should tell him
we painted that?

01:25:25.143 --> 01:25:27.179
Fuck it.
Let's go walk through a nurse.

01:25:27.383 --> 01:25:29.692
Watch it! Some of them are guys.

01:28:20.583 --> 01:28:21.572
