15:48.152 --> 15:51.189
<b>- Welcome to your first</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

15:51.289 --> 15:55.193
<b>You make it to the end,</b>
<b>you will earn $100,000,</b>

15:55.293 --> 15:59.063
<b>a feature in "Ink" magazine,</b>
<b>and the title of Ink Master.</b>

16:00.899 --> 16:03.801
<b>Now, you may have wondered</b>
<b>why there's only eight of you.</b>

16:03.902 --> 16:07.405
<b>Well, you're about to find out.</b>

16:07.505 --> 16:10.074
<b>- I knew it was coming.</b>
<b>- To win the $100,000,</b>

16:10.174 --> 16:13.678
<b>you must not only defeat every</b>
<b>artist here...</b>

16:13.811 --> 16:17.715
<b>you must also out-tattoo</b>
<b>some of the fiercest artists</b>

16:17.815 --> 16:20.184
<b>ever to compete</b>
<b>for the title of Ink Master.</b>

16:20.285 --> 16:21.386
<b>- What?</b>

16:21.486 --> 16:24.155
<b>- And they're back,</b>
<b>looking for revenge.</b>

16:24.255 --> 16:25.790
<b>- [bleep].</b>

16:25.890 --> 16:27.992
<b>- Starting with the veteran</b>
<b>who's about to walk</b>

16:28.092 --> 16:29.527
<b>through the door.</b>

16:29.627 --> 16:31.429

<b>- Good to be back.</b>

17:04.561 --> 17:07.065
<b>I feel like a gladiator</b>

17:07.165 --> 17:10.401

17:15.173 --> 17:16.374
<b>for elimination.</b>

17:16.473 --> 17:18.434

<b>early battles we've seen</b>

17:20.144 --> 17:21.846
<b>in the history</b>

17:21.945 --> 17:24.281
<b> <i>- I love</i> </b>
<b> <i>a head-to-head challenge.</i> </b>

17:24.382 --> 17:25.916
<b> <i>This is where I shine.</i> </b>

17:26.017 --> 17:27.417
<b>Bring it on, big man.</b>

17:27.518 --> 17:31.322
<b>- St. Marq, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

17:31.422 --> 17:33.422
<b>- This is a sad day</b>
<b>when somebody strong goes home.</b>

17:33.491 --> 17:35.460
<b>There's a lot more challenges</b>
<b>coming up that who knows</b>

17:35.560 --> 17:36.461
<b>how you would've done in them.</b>

17:36.561 --> 17:39.797
<b>We'll never know.</b>

17:39.898 --> 17:44.769
<b>- I'm back, and I'm going</b>
<b>to compete with a vengeance.</b>

17:44.802 --> 17:49.073
<b>- Today, St. Marq is not only</b>
<b>entering the competition,</b>

17:49.173 --> 17:52.610
<b>but he's also calling the shots.</b>

17:52.777 --> 17:54.479
<b>- Ho-oh-oh</b> <b>- [bleep]!</b>

17:54.579 --> 17:58.483
<b>- Each week, one veteran artist</b>
<b>will return to the competition.</b>

17:58.583 --> 18:01.920
<b>The week they return,</b>
<b>that veteran will choose</b>

18:02.020 --> 18:03.254
<b>the elimination tattoo.</b>

18:03.354 --> 18:05.423
<b>- Goddamnit!</b>

18:05.523 --> 18:06.591
<b>- No!</b>

18:06.691 --> 18:07.892
<b>They already have an advantage</b>

18:07.992 --> 18:09.294
<b> <i>'cause you've</i> </b>
<b> <i>played the game before.</i> </b>

18:09.394 --> 18:12.463
<b> <i>This guy get to pick</i> </b>
<b> <i>the damn challenge as well?</i> </b>

18:12.564 --> 18:14.699
<b>- Okay, St. Marq,</b>
<b>it's your call.</b>

18:14.799 --> 18:17.035
<b>What's the first</b>
<b>elimination tattoo?</b>

18:17.135 --> 18:19.537
<b>- The subject matter will be</b>
<b>the seven deadly sins.</b>

18:19.637 --> 18:20.672
<b>- Ooh.</b>

18:20.805 --> 18:22.340
<b>- We will be doing this</b>
<b>in black and gray.</b>

18:22.440 --> 18:25.643
<b>We will be using</b>
<b>our shaders only.</b>

18:25.743 --> 18:28.546
<b>- Seriously?</b>

18:28.646 --> 18:30.748
<b> <i>- I always use a liner</i> </b>
<b> <i>when I tattoo.</i> </b>

18:30.815 --> 18:32.784
<b>An outline is the foundation</b>
<b>of a tattoo.</b>

18:32.884 --> 18:35.286
<b>You can't build anything</b>
<b>without a foundation.</b>

18:35.386 --> 18:37.288
<b>- St. Marq, why did you</b>
<b>make that choice?</b>

18:37.388 --> 18:38.957
<b>- I think everybody knows</b>
<b>that I do a lot of work</b>

18:39.057 --> 18:40.325
<b>that doesn't need a liner.</b>

18:40.425 --> 18:42.227
<b>You guys like to judge me</b>
<b>against other black and gray</b>

18:42.327 --> 18:44.162
<b>artists that use liners</b>
<b>incessantly,</b>

18:44.262 --> 18:47.999
<b>and this is my rules,</b>
<b>my playground, my challenge.</b>

18:48.099 --> 18:50.435
<b>If your shading is as good</b>
<b>as it needs to be,</b>

18:50.535 --> 18:52.170
<b>you should be able</b>
<b>to delete that liner</b>

18:52.270 --> 18:54.639
<b>and tattoo as cleanly</b>
<b>and as sharply</b>

18:54.772 --> 18:56.341
<b>as you would with a liner.</b>

18:56.441 --> 18:58.042
<b>- St. Marq, have a seat.</b>

18:58.142 --> 18:59.677
<b> <i>- That's the dumbest [bleep]</i> </b>
<b> <i>I've ever heard in my life.</i> </b>

18:59.777 --> 19:01.246
<b> <i>Liners come to a point.</i> </b>

19:01.346 --> 19:03.281
<b>It's almost impossible</b>
<b>to only use shaders,</b>

19:03.381 --> 19:05.383
<b>because they're flat... they're</b>
<b>not meant for outlining.</b>

19:05.483 --> 19:07.485
<b>They're meant for shading,</b>
<b>so you really have to know</b>

19:07.585 --> 19:09.654
<b>the tricks to really angle</b>
<b>the needle a certain way</b>

19:09.787 --> 19:11.522
<b>to get a crisp, clean outline.</b>

19:11.623 --> 19:13.558
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

19:18.596 --> 19:20.116
<b>Christian,</b>
<b>you won the flash challenge.</b>

19:20.198 --> 19:22.967
<b>You now have the power</b>
<b>to assign the canvases.</b>

19:23.067 --> 19:25.837
<b>This is your chance</b>
<b>to level the playing field.</b>

19:25.937 --> 19:28.072
<b>Go ahead and assign the skulls.</b>

19:28.172 --> 19:30.532
<b> <i>- I want to take St. Marq out</i> </b>
<b> <i>and show the rest of the house</i> </b>

19:30.608 --> 19:32.010
<b>that we need to stick together</b>

19:32.110 --> 19:34.512
<b>until all these veterans</b>
<b>are out the door.</b>

19:34.612 --> 19:36.214
<b>I'm already looking at this</b>
<b>competition</b>

19:36.314 --> 19:37.749
<b>like a game of chess,</b>
<b>and in chess,</b>

19:37.782 --> 19:39.422
<b>you got to think four or five</b>
<b>moves ahead.</b>

19:39.450 --> 19:40.752
<b>So, what are you looking for,</b>
<b>man?</b>

19:40.785 --> 19:42.987
<b>- I want the sin of gluttony</b>
<b>on my right arm.</b>

19:43.087 --> 19:44.289
<b>- Any idea how you want</b>
<b>to do that?</b>

19:44.389 --> 19:46.357
<b>- Picture of a man</b>
<b>chained to a chair</b>

19:46.457 --> 19:48.760
<b>force-fed by a demon.</b>

19:48.793 --> 19:50.194
<b>- How about you?</b>
<b>- The sin of greed</b>

19:50.295 --> 19:54.532
<b>on the left side of my head.</b>
<b>- Holy [bleep].</b>

19:54.632 --> 19:58.002
<b>- I'd like a woman</b>
<b>holding a apple with a serpent.</b>

19:58.102 --> 19:59.304
<b> <i>- That's a nightmare.</i> </b>

19:59.404 --> 20:01.244
<b>There's no way you can get</b>
<b>all that detail done</b>

20:01.306 --> 20:03.441
<b> <i>on the head with just a shader.</i> </b>

20:03.541 --> 20:04.542
<b>- How about you, man?</b>

20:04.642 --> 20:06.411
<b>- My sin is lust.</b>
<b>It would be on my chest.</b>

20:06.511 --> 20:08.646
<b>It's three women, one snake</b>
<b>slithering in and out</b>

20:08.780 --> 20:09.647
<b>of each of their mouths.</b>

20:09.781 --> 20:11.449
<b>- [bleep].</b>
<b>- No way, dude.</b>

20:11.549 --> 20:14.152
<b>Three different faces,</b>
<b>bunch of different snakes.</b>

20:14.252 --> 20:16.020
<b> <i>You can't do that in six hours.</i> </b>

20:16.120 --> 20:18.022
<b>- I'd like the sin of pride</b>
<b>on my right arm.</b>

20:18.122 --> 20:20.858
<b>- Handing out the skulls</b>
<b>is a clear advantage.</b>

20:20.959 --> 20:22.227
<b>These are rookies.</b>

20:22.327 --> 20:25.196
<b>I'm not even sure if they know</b>
<b>what to do with it.</b>

20:25.296 --> 20:28.099
<b>- This is a chance for me</b>
<b>to evaluate everybody else.</b>

20:28.199 --> 20:29.734
<b>- Is he looking at you, Corey?</b>

20:29.801 --> 20:32.103
<b> <i>- It's really important</i> </b>
<b> <i>to formulate a strategy</i> </b>

20:32.203 --> 20:34.939
<b>in this competition because</b>
<b>it's not just about tattooing.</b>

20:35.039 --> 20:37.809
<b> <i>It's also about how you use</i> </b>
<b> <i>and manipulate people</i> </b>

20:37.909 --> 20:39.510
<b>to get what you need and want.</b>

20:39.611 --> 20:40.811
<b>Well, that leaves you, my man.</b>

20:40.879 --> 20:42.146
<b> <i>Right now, most of these kids</i> </b>

20:42.247 --> 20:44.749
<b>look like deers</b>
<b>in the headlights.</b>

20:44.816 --> 20:46.618
<b>- Okay, canvases, one by one,</b>

20:46.751 --> 20:50.555
<b>please read the artist's name</b>
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

20:50.655 --> 20:52.790
<b>- Anthony.</b>

20:52.891 --> 20:55.593
<b>- Megan.</b>

20:55.760 --> 21:00.198
<b>- Who wants to shave</b>
<b>a homegirl's head?</b>

21:00.298 --> 21:02.800
<b>- Corey.</b>
<b>- I got you, Miss Lady.</b>

21:02.901 --> 21:04.335
<b> <i>Now I know Christian's</i> </b>
<b> <i>playing the game.</i> </b>

21:04.435 --> 21:06.004
<b>He's gunning for me.</b>

21:06.104 --> 21:07.805
<b>- Chris.</b>

21:07.906 --> 21:10.975
<b>- Ashley.</b>
<b>- That's me.</b>

21:11.075 --> 21:13.378
<b>Who's left?</b>

21:13.478 --> 21:14.979
<b>- St. Marq.</b>

21:15.079 --> 21:17.282
<b> <i>- So, this guy Christian</i> </b>
<b> <i>gives me the guy who wants</i> </b>

21:17.382 --> 21:19.317
<b>three [bleep] portraits</b>
<b>on his chest.</b>

21:19.417 --> 21:21.352
<b> <i>I don't think that he realizes</i> </b>
<b> <i>what he's done.</i> </b>

21:21.452 --> 21:24.222
<b>He just created an enemy</b>
<b>in St. Marq.</b>

21:24.322 --> 21:26.157
<b>- Picasso.</b>
<b>- Suget.</b>

21:26.257 --> 21:27.759
<b>- Alex.</b>

21:27.859 --> 21:30.028
<b>- Christian.</b>

21:30.128 --> 21:32.196
<b>- Remember,</b>
<b>after the elimination tattoo,</b>

21:32.297 --> 21:35.199
<b>the human canvas jury will vote</b>
<b>on the tattoo that they think</b>

21:35.300 --> 21:39.337
<b>is the worst, and put one artist</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

21:39.437 --> 21:42.574
<b>You'll have six hours</b>
<b>to create a black-and-gray</b>

21:42.740 --> 21:46.744
<b>seven deadly sins tattoo</b>
<b>using only shaders.</b>

21:46.778 --> 21:50.014
<b>Based on your work, one of you</b>
<b>will be the first artist</b>

21:50.114 --> 21:52.283
<b>to close shop.</b>

21:52.383 --> 21:54.385
<b>Good luck.</b>

21:54.485 --> 21:56.588
<b>- Alex.</b>
<b>- Right over here.</b>

21:56.754 --> 21:58.623
<b>- Good.</b>
<b>Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited.</b>

21:58.756 --> 22:00.625
<b> <i>- St. Marq issuing</i> </b>
<b> <i>the challenge to only use</i> </b>

22:00.758 --> 22:02.760
<b>a shader... he's really pushing</b>
<b>these other artists</b>

22:02.860 --> 22:03.860
<b>to be on his level.</b>

22:03.928 --> 22:06.130
<b>- You got the best</b>
<b>[bleep] guy here.</b>

22:06.231 --> 22:07.498
<b> <i>- I think a lot</i> </b>
<b> <i>of these artists are gonna</i> </b>

22:07.599 --> 22:09.719
<b> <i>have trouble with the way that</i> </b>
<b> <i>they assemble the piece</i> </b>

22:09.767 --> 22:12.103
<b>to make their shader</b>
<b>a powerful weapon.</b>

22:12.203 --> 22:13.605
<b>- We're definitely limited.</b>

22:13.771 --> 22:15.691
<b>I need to design something</b>
<b>that, with no outline,</b>

22:15.773 --> 22:16.774
<b>that's gonna look good.</b>

22:16.875 --> 22:18.155
<b> <i>- I hope this group</i> </b>
<b> <i>came to play.</i> </b>

22:18.209 --> 22:20.378
<b>This is what it takes</b>
<b>to be in the competition.</b>

22:20.478 --> 22:22.714
<b>- How committed are you</b>
<b>to the left side of your head?</b>

22:22.780 --> 22:24.015
<b>- I want to tat my head.</b>

22:24.115 --> 22:26.117

<b>but she is stuck</b>
<b>on the [bleep] head.</b>

22:30.488 --> 22:32.008
<b>The only thing is,</b>
<b>with this challenge,</b>

22:32.056 --> 22:33.424
<b>we're not allowed to use liners.</b>

22:33.524 --> 22:34.826
<b>- I know.</b> <b>I want to do my head.</b>

22:34.926 --> 22:36.427
<b>- I'm just a little worried</b>
<b>on how she's gonna</b>

22:36.527 --> 22:37.527
<b>be able to take it.</b>

22:37.562 --> 22:39.030
<b>You're stuck on the head?</b> <b>100%?</b>

22:39.130 --> 22:40.130
<b>- Hundred.</b>
<b>- Yeah?</b>

22:40.198 --> 22:41.566
<b>- Yeah.</b>

22:41.733 --> 22:43.735
<b>- As far as,</b>
<b>like, your whole chest,</b>

22:43.835 --> 22:45.470
<b>six hours,</b>
<b>it's just not gonna happen.</b>

22:45.570 --> 22:48.606
<b>- I was thinking more like a</b>
<b>three... 'cause like, three heads,</b>

22:48.740 --> 22:50.620
<b>you know, like...</b>
<b>like, yeah, spread out across.</b>

22:50.742 --> 22:53.978
<b>- There's bad canvases,</b>
<b>and then there's this guy.</b>

22:54.078 --> 22:55.413
<b>If we can focus on one portrait,</b>

22:55.513 --> 22:58.049
<b>I can get a lot more detail</b>
<b>into the snake.</b>

22:58.149 --> 22:59.250
<b>- All right, one woman?</b>

22:59.350 --> 23:00.785
<b>Is there a way you could still</b>
<b>do, like, two women?</b>

23:00.885 --> 23:02.921
<b>- One portrait</b>
<b>is what I'm saying.</b>

23:03.021 --> 23:04.822
<b>- This just might be</b>
<b>the toughest canvas</b>

23:04.923 --> 23:05.923
<b>I've ever been dealt.</b>

<b>I saw you look back</b>

<b>- I think you shook him up.</b>

23:32.717 --> 23:34.717
<b>- This is a competition,</b>
<b>and I'll gun for everybody</b>

23:34.752 --> 23:35.987
<b>in the house, you know?</b>

23:36.087 --> 23:38.368
<b>Whether I like them or not,</b>
<b>whether I respect them or not,</b>

23:38.422 --> 23:39.924
<b>I'm coming after everybody,</b>

23:40.024 --> 23:41.464
<b>but I can only do that</b>
<b>one at a time,</b>

23:41.559 --> 23:43.895
<b>and right now,</b>
<b>Marq was my target.</b>

23:45.997 --> 23:48.933
<b> <i>[eerie, bass-heavy music]</i> </b>

23:53.471 --> 23:56.841
<b>- Artists, you have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo a black-and-gray</b>

23:56.941 --> 24:00.711
<b>seven deadly sins tattoo</b>
<b>using only shaders,</b>

24:00.812 --> 24:02.747
<b>and your time...</b>

24:02.847 --> 24:04.115
<b>starts...</b>

24:04.215 --> 24:05.116
<b>now.</b>

24:05.216 --> 24:06.384
<b>- Let's do this.</b>

24:06.484 --> 24:07.552
<b>- Okay, come around here.</b>

24:08.719 --> 24:10.087
<b>- Okay.</b>

24:10.188 --> 24:12.423
<b>- Any artist in the room should</b>
<b>be proficient with their shader.</b>

24:12.523 --> 24:14.403
<b> <i>If these artists know</i> </b>
<b> <i>how to choose this battle,</i> </b>

24:14.492 --> 24:16.492
<b> <i>and give themselves enough</i> </b>
<b> <i>space to really show off</i> </b>

24:16.561 --> 24:18.696
<b>with the shader,</b>
<b>they can do beautiful work.</b>

24:18.796 --> 24:21.132
<b>- I'm not gonna create</b>
<b>any hard edges on this thing.</b>

24:21.232 --> 24:23.234
<b>I've only been tattooing</b>
<b>for five years.</b>

24:23.334 --> 24:26.070
<b>There's a lot on the line.</b>
<b>This is kind of overwhelming.</b>

24:26.170 --> 24:27.805
<b>- If you're good at what you do,</b>
<b>it won't be a problem.</b>

24:27.905 --> 24:30.074
<b>- I definitely think the judges</b>
<b>are gonna underestimate me.</b>

24:30.174 --> 24:32.543
<b>I have to do whatever it takes</b>
<b>to show that I'm just as good</b>

24:32.710 --> 24:34.178
<b>as these veterans.</b>

24:34.278 --> 24:35.179
<b>- Ahh!</b>

24:35.279 --> 24:36.314
<b>- Looks perfect.</b>

24:36.414 --> 24:37.815
<b> <i>My canvas wanted</i> </b>
<b> <i>three portraits,</i> </b>

24:37.915 --> 24:39.283
<b>snakes coming out</b>
<b>of their mouths.</b>

24:39.383 --> 24:41.486
<b> <i>We've got that down</i> </b>
<b> <i>to one portrait</i> </b>

24:41.586 --> 24:43.921
<b> <i>with a serpent not coming out</i> </b>
<b> <i>of her mouth.</i> </b>

24:44.021 --> 24:45.022
<b>Thank God.</b>

24:45.122 --> 24:47.091
<b>- So, you guys obviously</b>
<b>changed your design.</b>

24:47.191 --> 24:48.726
<b>You initially wanted</b>
<b>three women.</b>

24:48.793 --> 24:50.728
<b>- His whole chest.</b>
<b>- With the snake going through</b>

24:50.828 --> 24:52.163
<b>three different mouths.</b>

24:52.263 --> 24:54.398
<b>- Well, we kind of talked about</b>
<b>seeing how far he could get,</b>

24:54.499 --> 24:57.168
<b>but I don't know if we'll</b>
<b>be able to do the whole chest.</b>

24:57.268 --> 24:59.036
<b> <i>Being a veteran</i> </b>
<b> <i>to this competition,</i> </b>

24:59.137 --> 25:01.739
<b>I know how to control the</b>
<b>situation with these canvases.</b>

25:01.772 --> 25:03.074
<b>I'm gonna give you</b>
<b>a little bit of shading</b>

25:03.174 --> 25:05.409
<b>on this wing right here too</b>
<b>so it doesn't look so blank.</b>

25:05.510 --> 25:07.211
<b> <i>My canvas is</i> </b>
<b> <i>right where I want him.</i> </b>

25:07.311 --> 25:08.980
<b>This challenge is mine.</b>

25:14.452 --> 25:16.587
<b>- St. Marq is a completely</b>
<b>arrogant douche.</b>

25:20.858 --> 25:22.927
<b>If he's such a tattoo god,</b>
<b>he should just be able</b>

25:23.027 --> 25:24.962
<b>to give his canvas</b>
<b>exactly what he wants.</b>

25:27.932 --> 25:29.000
<b>- [groaning]</b>

25:29.100 --> 25:30.535
<b>- This lady wants her head</b>
<b>tattooed,</b>

25:30.701 --> 25:32.069
<b>[woman whines]</b>
<b>and I couldn't convince her</b>

25:32.170 --> 25:33.371
<b>to move it</b>
<b>to a different place...</b>

25:33.471 --> 25:35.573
<b>[woman cries]</b>
<b> <i>And now she's crying,</i> </b>

25:35.706 --> 25:37.341
<b>[woman crying]</b> <b> <i>She's squirming.</i> </b>

25:37.441 --> 25:38.441
<b>This is a nightmare.</b>

25:38.509 --> 25:39.844
<b>[woman groans]</b>

25:39.944 --> 25:42.213
<b> <i>I'm definitely a competitive</i> </b>

25:42.313 --> 25:43.481
<b> <i>All kids from the hood...</i> </b>

25:43.581 --> 25:45.583
<b>we're all trying</b>
<b>to achieve something,</b>

25:45.716 --> 25:47.218
<b> <i>'cause we come from nothing.</i> </b>

25:47.318 --> 25:49.420
<b> <i>I do have my own style,</i> </b>
<b> <i>which is a mix</i> </b>

25:49.520 --> 25:51.923
<b> <i>of neo-traditionalism</i> </b>
<b> <i>with realism.</i> </b>

25:52.023 --> 25:53.825
<b>You're not gonna really get that</b>
<b>from anybody else.</b>

25:53.925 --> 25:55.560
<b>- Nobody told you</b>
<b>to be so talented.</b>

25:55.726 --> 25:58.196
<b>How dare you?</b>
<b>- I'm a badass tattoo artist.</b>

25:58.296 --> 26:00.832
<b>Only place I can go next</b>
<b>is to be Ink Master.</b>

26:00.932 --> 26:03.835
<b>- Three hours left.</b>

26:03.935 --> 26:06.137
<b> <i>- I'm feeling really good</i> </b>
<b> <i>about this tattoo,</i> </b>

26:06.237 --> 26:09.106
<b>and whether I have a liner</b>
<b>or not, I will deliver.</b>

26:09.207 --> 26:10.475
<b>- Not [bleep] around, huh?</b>

26:10.575 --> 26:12.577
<b>- Nah, man.</b>
<b>I'm here for 100 grand.</b>

26:12.677 --> 26:14.011
<b>They should be scared.</b>

26:14.111 --> 26:15.546
<b>- What are your guys' thoughts?</b>

26:15.680 --> 26:17.148
<b>- I think Megan's probably</b>
<b>the one who's getting</b>

26:17.248 --> 26:19.851
<b>the most linear details</b>
<b>out of her shader.</b>

26:19.951 --> 26:20.985
<b>- Yeah, she's killing it.</b>

26:21.085 --> 26:22.753
<b>Christian's tattoo is just nice.</b>

26:22.854 --> 26:25.022
<b>- That's what it's supposed</b>
<b>to look like with no lines.</b>

26:25.122 --> 26:28.392
<b>St. Marq made this challenge,</b>
<b>and what is he doing?</b>

26:28.493 --> 26:31.195
<b>- Five inches of pure black</b>
<b>background.</b>

26:31.295 --> 26:33.231
<b>- It's bad karma for saying</b>
<b>he's a tattoo god.</b>

26:33.331 --> 26:34.966
<b>- Yeah.</b>

26:35.066 --> 26:38.936
<b>One more hour remaining.</b>

26:39.036 --> 26:41.172
<b>- Put your game face on,</b>
<b>Jonathan.</b>

26:41.272 --> 26:43.074
<b> <i>I bombed on my flash challenge.</i> </b>

26:43.174 --> 26:46.077
<b>I have no choice but to put out</b>
<b>a good tattoo.</b>

26:46.177 --> 26:47.712
<b>- Dude, I can't believe</b>
<b>you took on</b>

26:47.812 --> 26:49.914
<b>doing full figures that small.</b>

26:50.014 --> 26:51.415
<b>- That's why</b>
<b>it's taking me forever.</b>

26:51.516 --> 26:54.018
<b>I left art school</b>
<b>with one semester left</b>

26:54.118 --> 26:56.754
<b> <i>because I found tattooing,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and I knew it was my passion.</i> </b>

26:56.854 --> 26:58.890
<b> <i>My fine art background</i> </b>
<b> <i>does set me apart</i> </b>

26:58.990 --> 27:00.358
<b> <i>from other tattoo artists.</i> </b>

27:00.458 --> 27:02.994
<b> <i>Photo-realism, black-and-gray,</i> </b>
<b> <i>portraits...</i> </b>

27:03.094 --> 27:04.896
<b> <i>that's what people</i> </b>
<b> <i>come to see me for.</i> </b>

27:04.996 --> 27:06.731
<b>I have the talent</b>
<b>to be Ink Master.</b>

27:06.831 --> 27:08.099
<b>I just need the title.</b>

27:08.199 --> 27:09.801
<b>- What's happening, man?</b>
<b>- What's going on, guys?</b>

27:09.901 --> 27:10.835
<b> <i>- And this is the first time</i> </b>
<b> <i>they're gonna</i> </b>

27:10.935 --> 27:12.003
<b> <i>get to see me tattoo.</i> </b>

27:12.103 --> 27:14.672
<b>Got to show some saturation,</b>
<b>some contrast.</b>

27:14.739 --> 27:16.307
<b>- How's this no-liner challenge</b>
<b>for you?</b>

27:16.407 --> 27:18.476
<b>- Pretty good.</b> <b>Pretty easy.</b>

27:18.576 --> 27:20.244
<b>I need to redeem myself.</b>

27:20.344 --> 27:21.779
<b>Now they got me worried.</b>

27:21.879 --> 27:24.248
<b> <i>I would hate to be</i> </b>
<b> <i>the first one to go home.</i> </b>

27:24.348 --> 27:27.585

27:27.685 --> 27:28.986
<b> <i>I'm an artist,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and I've never worked</i> </b>

27:29.086 --> 27:30.054
<b> <i>in these kind of conditions.</i> </b>

27:30.154 --> 27:32.056
<b>I don't rush through my tattoos.</b>

27:32.156 --> 27:34.125
<b> <i>Time is my enemy.</i> </b>

27:34.225 --> 27:37.495
<b>- Five, four, three,</b>

27:37.595 --> 27:39.897
<b>two, one.</b> <b>That is it.</b>

27:39.997 --> 27:41.699
<b>Time is up.</b> <b>Machines down.</b>

27:41.732 --> 27:42.967
<b>No more ink.</b>

27:43.067 --> 27:44.402
<b>- Pop up.</b> <b>Check it out.</b>

27:44.502 --> 27:46.704
<b>- I love it.</b>
<b>- Nice.</b>

27:46.804 --> 27:47.844
<b>- Look at the detail, man.</b>

27:47.905 --> 27:49.340
<b>Almost looks 3-D.</b>

27:49.440 --> 27:51.609
<b> <i>- St. Marq, why does your</i> </b>
<b> <i>tattoo look like a little boy</i> </b>

27:51.709 --> 27:53.478
<b> <i>with an umbrella</i> </b>
<b> <i>on top of his head?</i> </b>

27:53.578 --> 27:56.981
<b>That does not look</b>
<b>like the tattoo of a tattoo god.</b>

27:57.081 --> 27:58.749
<b>How can you pick your own</b>
<b>challenge</b>

27:58.850 --> 28:00.451
<b>and [bleep] it up that bad?</b>

28:02.220 --> 28:04.121
<b>- You scared, baby?</b>
<b>- Nobody is scared of you.</b>

<b>You already had a chance to be</b>
<b>Ink Master once,</b>

28:06.390 --> 28:07.470
<b>and you wasn't good enough.</b>

28:07.558 --> 28:08.659
<b>- A lot of problems with this.</b>

28:08.759 --> 28:11.329
<b>- This challenge is one</b>
<b>of the biggest backfires</b>

28:52.769 --> 28:56.540
<b>Black-and-gray tattoos</b>
<b>using only shaders.</b>

28:56.640 --> 28:59.509
<b>Christian, let's start with you.</b>

28:59.610 --> 29:01.979
<b>When you heard that this was</b>
<b>a shader-only challenge,</b>

29:02.079 --> 29:03.213
<b>what was your feeling</b>
<b>about that?</b>

29:03.313 --> 29:04.748
<b>- If you're proficient</b>
<b>with your needles,</b>

29:04.848 --> 29:06.850
<b>there's no such thing</b>
<b>as a liner or a shader.</b>

29:06.950 --> 29:09.786
<b>- It looks lined.</b>
<b>That takes some skill,</b>

29:09.886 --> 29:12.556
<b>and that speaks to</b>
<b>knowing your fundamentals.</b>

29:12.656 --> 29:15.759
<b>- This tattoo stands out</b>
<b>because right where the rose</b>

29:15.859 --> 29:17.694
<b> <i>connects, you give it</i> </b>
<b> <i>that nice highlight.</i> </b>

29:17.794 --> 29:20.330
<b> <i>That's the proper way</i> </b>
<b> <i>to play off a light source</i> </b>

29:20.497 --> 29:22.266
<b>to create edges,</b>
<b>to create highlights,</b>

29:22.366 --> 29:23.500
<b>and to create depth.</b>

29:23.533 --> 29:25.502
<b>You're</b>
<b>a definite competitor here.</b>

29:28.739 --> 29:31.208
<b>- Picasso.</b>

29:31.308 --> 29:33.043
<b>- I really,</b>
<b>really, appreciate people</b>

29:33.143 --> 29:34.611
<b>that take a swing with artwork.</b>

29:34.711 --> 29:36.146
<b> <i>I like the dynamics</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the drawing,</i> </b>

29:36.246 --> 29:38.515
<b> <i>but you did not</i> </b>
<b> <i>let your tattoo breath.</i> </b>

29:38.582 --> 29:40.517
<b>You took a pillow</b>
<b>and just smothered it.</b>

29:40.584 --> 29:42.519
<b>- Because I didn't get to tattoo</b>
<b>in the first challenge,</b>

29:42.586 --> 29:44.521
<b>I tried to cram in</b>
<b>a lot of work this time.</b>

29:44.621 --> 29:46.990
<b> <i>- One of the basic fundamentals</i> </b>
<b> <i>is contrast.</i> </b>

29:49.926 --> 29:52.863
<b> <i>Everything is just dark</i> </b>
<b> <i>on dark on dark.</i> </b>

<b>Anytime you have a tattoo</b>
<b>that's fresh on a big,</b>

29:55.399 --> 29:56.633
<b>open, blank place of skin,</b>

29:56.733 --> 29:58.068
<b>and everybody thinks</b>
<b>it's a cover-up,</b>

29:58.168 --> 30:00.671
<b>it's obviously a bad thing.</b>

30:00.771 --> 30:01.838
<b>- [sighs]</b>

30:01.939 --> 30:03.941
<b>- Megan.</b>

<b>- The details you were able</b>
<b>to capture</b>

30:05.676 --> 30:07.978
<b> <i>shows you know a lot</i> </b>
<b> <i>about contouring,</i> </b>

30:08.078 --> 30:10.547
<b> <i>creating depth and shadows...</i> </b>
<b> <i>which are more advanced</i> </b>

30:10.614 --> 30:12.649
<b>than just the fundamentals</b>
<b>of tattooing.</b>

30:12.749 --> 30:15.118
<b>- Perfect placement</b>
<b>of the highlight in the pupil.</b>

30:15.218 --> 30:16.620
<b> <i>It works incredibly.</i> </b>

30:16.720 --> 30:19.256
<b> <i>Using the shader and pulling</i> </b>
<b> <i>off all these tricks...</i> </b>

30:19.356 --> 30:21.158
<b>can't wait to see you</b>
<b>work with a liner.</b>

30:21.258 --> 30:23.360
<b>- Thanks.</b>

30:23.493 --> 30:25.963
<b>- Chris.</b>

30:26.063 --> 30:28.198
<b>- Overall, as a piece,</b>
<b>it's a weird placement.</b>

30:28.298 --> 30:29.833
<b>It's hard to see</b>
<b>what's going on.</b>

30:29.933 --> 30:31.401
<b>- One of the things</b>
<b>that's throwing it off</b>

30:31.501 --> 30:33.937
<b> <i>is the feather that creates</i> </b>
<b> <i>a weird underside of the eye.</i> </b>

30:34.037 --> 30:36.506
<b> <i>Had you have broken up the hard</i> </b>
<b> <i>edge that you put on the top,</i> </b>

30:36.607 --> 30:38.408
<b> <i>and really had it</i> </b>
<b> <i>wispy and broken,</i> </b>

30:38.508 --> 30:40.228
<b>your tattoo would look</b>
<b>completely different.</b>

30:41.211 --> 30:43.080
<b>In here, you're up against</b>
<b>somebody else</b>

30:43.180 --> 30:45.782
<b>who's making something smooth,</b>
<b>legible, and perfect.</b>

30:45.882 --> 30:48.318
<b>You have to be able to pull off</b>
<b>things that are gonna</b>

30:48.418 --> 30:51.521
<b>beat those people behind you.</b>

30:51.588 --> 30:52.789
<b>- Alex.</b>

30:52.889 --> 30:54.424
<b>- This one, for me,</b>
<b>falls really short</b>

30:54.524 --> 30:56.693
<b> <i>because I think this was</i> </b>
<b> <i>the easiest one of the day.</i> </b>

30:56.793 --> 30:58.929
<b>Had St. Marq himself</b>
<b>got ahold of this,</b>

30:59.029 --> 31:00.364

<b>is in the hair.</b>

31:02.866 --> 31:04.026
<b> <i>You could've detailed it out.</i> </b>

31:04.067 --> 31:06.536
<b>Instead, we just have big,</b>
<b>chunky, black shading.</b>

31:06.637 --> 31:09.106
<b>Not a very detail oriented</b>
<b>tattoo at all.</b>

31:09.206 --> 31:10.674
<b>I don't know if you all</b>
<b>are realizing this yet:</b>

31:10.774 --> 31:13.310
<b>This competition's</b>
<b>gonna be the toughest one</b>

31:13.477 --> 31:14.478
<b>that we've ever had.</b>

31:14.578 --> 31:15.912
<b>- Definitely starting</b>
<b>to realize that.</b>

31:16.013 --> 31:19.082
<b>- It's not a time that coasting</b>
<b>is gonna be an option at all.</b>

31:21.251 --> 31:22.486
<b>- Anthony.</b>

31:22.586 --> 31:24.621
<b>- The shading</b>
<b>in this tattoo is great.</b>

31:24.721 --> 31:26.323
<b> <i>Look at the areas</i> </b>
<b> <i>of saturated black</i> </b>

31:26.490 --> 31:28.292
<b> <i>that still make those</i> </b>
<b> <i>silhouettes breathable,</i> </b>

31:28.392 --> 31:30.494
<b> <i>and then the backlight</i> </b>
<b> <i>to where the demon behind it</i> </b>

31:30.527 --> 31:31.995
<b> <i>is a little bit softer.</i> </b>

31:32.095 --> 31:33.964
<b> <i>That's a great use of light</i> </b>

31:34.064 --> 31:35.632
<b> <i>and showing a really dark</i> image,</b>

31:35.732 --> 31:37.034
<b>but still letting it breathe.</b>

31:37.134 --> 31:38.902
<b>- Going to fundamentals,</b>
<b>it shows a lot</b>

31:39.002 --> 31:41.305
<b>of different techniques</b>
<b>that you have under your belt.</b>

31:41.405 --> 31:43.373
<b>- Thank you.</b>

31:43.507 --> 31:44.775
<b>- Ashley.</b>

31:44.875 --> 31:46.243
<b> <i>I love what you did</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the wings.</i> </b>

31:46.343 --> 31:49.513
<b> <i>I like the setup with the cloud</i> </b>
<b> <i>and the rays of the sun.</i> </b>

31:49.546 --> 31:52.849
<b>Where I lose it</b>
<b>is with the anatomical figures.</b>

31:52.950 --> 31:55.819
<b> <i>Certainly, if you look</i> </b>
<b> <i>at this woman in the profile,</i> </b>

31:55.919 --> 31:57.821
<b> <i>and that nose,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and maybe that little hand</i> </b>

31:57.921 --> 31:59.656
<b> <i>that's kind of poking in there.</i> </b>

31:59.756 --> 32:01.525
<b>- My canvas saw his tattoo</b>
<b>in the mirror.</b>

32:01.625 --> 32:03.393
<b>He was seeing something</b>
<b>he was proud to wear.</b>

32:03.527 --> 32:05.796
<b>- That's perfect,</b>
<b>but it still isn't gonna win.</b>

32:05.896 --> 32:07.364
<b>Look at the tattoos</b>
<b>that got praise today.</b>

32:07.531 --> 32:08.599
<b>They're all big and bold.</b>

32:08.699 --> 32:12.235
<b>Work smart, not hard.</b>
<b>That's how you win.</b>

32:12.336 --> 32:13.470
<b>- Corey.</b>

32:13.570 --> 32:15.472
<b>It's just... had an overall rough</b>
<b>feel to it.</b>

32:15.539 --> 32:17.608
<b> <i>- She wanted so much</i> </b>
<b> <i>in such a small area.</i> </b>

32:17.708 --> 32:18.942
<b> <i>- This is three elements.</i> </b>

32:19.042 --> 32:20.577
<b>It doesn't really look</b>
<b>like it's that much.</b>

32:20.677 --> 32:22.646
<b> <i>- Your details</i> </b>
<b> <i>did not come through.</i> </b>

32:22.746 --> 32:24.948
<b> <i>The mouth of the thing</i> </b>
<b> <i>is super crooked.</i> </b>

32:25.048 --> 32:27.217
<b> <i>The jaw line is really,</i> </b>
<b> <i>really rough.</i> </b>

32:27.317 --> 32:29.353
<b>Your man, St. Marq...</b>
<b>he did his job,</b>

32:29.486 --> 32:33.824
<b>and this one got the best</b>
<b>of you, in my opinion.</b>

32:33.924 --> 32:37.194
<b>- St. Marq.</b>

32:37.294 --> 32:40.197
<b>We know you to excel</b>
<b>with your shader,</b>

32:40.297 --> 32:42.866
<b> <i>but this is not what we</i> </b>
<b> <i>expected to see from you today.</i> </b>

32:42.966 --> 32:44.501
<b> <i>A lot of problems with this.</i> </b>

32:44.534 --> 32:46.603
<b>- This is the first time</b>
<b>since I've been here</b>

32:46.703 --> 32:49.506
<b>that I'm not happy</b>
<b>with the outcome.</b>

32:49.539 --> 32:52.676
<b> <i>- This challenge is probably</i> </b>
<b> <i>one of the biggest backfires</i> </b>

32:52.776 --> 32:54.077
<b>in "Ink Master" history.</b>

32:54.177 --> 32:57.648
<b> <i>There's so much wasted space</i> </b>
<b> <i>of solid black.</i> </b>

32:57.748 --> 32:59.950
<b> <i>There's literally no detail</i> </b>
<b> <i>except for that little bit</i> </b>

33:00.050 --> 33:01.285
<b> <i>in that head of that snake.</i> </b>

33:01.385 --> 33:03.687
<b>This is the worst tattoo</b>
<b>you've done on this competition.</b>

33:03.787 --> 33:05.055
<b>It's unfortunate.</b>

33:05.155 --> 33:06.890
<b>It's good for the people</b>
<b>standing behind you, though.</b>

33:06.990 --> 33:09.526
<b>- If you put a target on</b>
<b>yourself, everybody's shooting.</b>

33:09.626 --> 33:10.727
<b>- That's not how I wanted</b>
<b>to come back.</b>

33:10.827 --> 33:12.427
<b>- Some of the best tattooers</b>
<b>leave early,</b>

33:12.462 --> 33:14.097
<b>and that was the case for you,</b>

33:14.197 --> 33:16.077
<b>and today, you're putting</b>
<b>yourself in a position</b>

33:16.166 --> 33:20.470
<b>to be that person again.</b>

33:20.570 --> 33:21.850
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>we have to determine</b>

33:21.939 --> 33:23.907
<b>who had the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

33:24.007 --> 33:25.175
<b>Oliver,</b>
<b>which way are you leaning?</b>

33:25.275 --> 33:28.145
<b>- For me, the two standouts</b>
<b>are Christian and Megan.</b>

33:28.245 --> 33:30.213
<b>Something about the simplicity</b>
<b>and the cleanliness</b>

33:30.314 --> 33:31.314
<b> <i>of Christian's tattoo...</i> </b>

33:31.348 --> 33:33.083
<b>I'm gonna vote for Christian.</b>

33:33.183 --> 33:35.485
<b>- Megan just pushed herself</b>
<b>to cram in</b>

33:35.552 --> 33:37.654
<b> <i>as much line work</i> </b>
<b> <i>without a liner.</i> </b>

33:37.754 --> 33:39.489
<b>I'm with Megan.</b>

33:39.523 --> 33:42.392
<b>- In terms of creativity,</b>
<b>artistry,</b>

33:42.492 --> 33:44.061
<b>and technical ability,</b>

33:44.161 --> 33:45.595
<b>my vote is for Megan.</b>

33:45.696 --> 33:48.899
<b>The judges have decided</b>
<b>that the best tattoo of the day</b>

33:48.999 --> 33:50.033

33:50.133 --> 33:51.335

38:23.796 --> 38:24.997
<b>- I didn't pick my canvas.</b>

38:25.131 --> 38:26.832
<b>- Would you say that your</b>
<b>shading outdoes Marq's?</b>

38:26.933 --> 38:29.135
<b> <i>- My snake is better</i> </b>
<b> <i>than that top snake he did.</i> </b>

38:29.168 --> 38:30.136
<b>- No chance.</b>

38:30.169 --> 38:31.704
<b>- My hair</b>
<b>is better than his hair.</b>

38:31.804 --> 38:33.506
<b>- The shader challenge</b>
<b>just got you,</b>

38:33.606 --> 38:35.541
<b>and that was</b>
<b>what he set out to do.</b>

38:35.641 --> 38:36.776
<b>Had you have had a liner,</b>

38:36.876 --> 38:38.144
<b>this could be</b>
<b>completely different,</b>

38:38.211 --> 38:41.147
<b>but he rattled you,</b>
<b>and it looks obvious.</b>

38:41.247 --> 38:42.448
<b>- Ashley.</b>

38:42.548 --> 38:44.188
<b>- My tattoo's better</b>
<b>than these two guys'.</b>

38:44.217 --> 38:45.418
<b>- That's a little arrogant.</b>

38:45.518 --> 38:47.119
<b> <i>- I gave that guy</i> </b>
<b> <i>exactly what he wanted.</i> </b>

38:47.220 --> 38:48.120
<b> <i>- I think the faces were</i> </b>
<b> <i>way too small</i> </b>

38:48.221 --> 38:49.522
<b>to give yourself</b>
<b>a chance at all.</b>

38:49.622 --> 38:51.958
<b> <i>- If I had a liner</i> </b>
<b> <i>and I could tweak it, yeah,</i> </b>

38:52.091 --> 38:53.993
<b>but you wanted everyone</b>
<b>to tattoo with just a shader.</b>

38:54.093 --> 38:54.994
<b>That's exactly what I did.</b>

38:55.094 --> 38:56.295
<b>- You should be able</b>
<b>to use a shader.</b>

38:56.395 --> 38:58.231
<b>- That [bleep] readable</b>
<b>from all the way over here.</b>

38:58.331 --> 39:00.600
<b>- But, Ashley, there's serious</b>
<b>problems with this tattoo.</b>

39:00.700 --> 39:02.001
<b>And if St. Marq's</b>
<b>gonna be down here,</b>

39:02.101 --> 39:03.336
<b>then you're sure as hell</b>
<b>gonna be down here,</b>

39:03.436 --> 39:05.471
<b>'cause your shading's</b>
<b>not near as smooth as his.</b>

39:05.571 --> 39:08.841
<b>You're gonna have to get</b>
<b>smoother than this.</b>

39:08.941 --> 39:10.710
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>Time to make a decision.</b>

39:10.810 --> 39:12.311
<b>Who's going home?</b>

39:12.411 --> 39:13.946
<b>- Ashley,</b>
<b>I don't love everything</b>

39:14.113 --> 39:15.448
<b> <i>about your tattoo by any means,</i> </b>

39:15.548 --> 39:17.950
<b>but this conversation doesn't</b>
<b>have to do with you anymore.</b>

39:18.117 --> 39:19.285
<b>My battle's between</b>

39:19.385 --> 39:21.120
<b>St. Marq and Corey.</b> <b>- I agree.</b>

39:21.220 --> 39:23.389
<b>- St. Marq coming in with</b>
<b>this challenge</b>

39:23.489 --> 39:26.125
<b>and botching it himself,</b>
<b>it's almost instinctual</b>

39:26.225 --> 39:28.194
<b>to want to send him home,</b>
<b>but if I just look at</b>

39:28.294 --> 39:30.129
<b>the quality of the black,</b>
<b>quality of shading,</b>

39:30.162 --> 39:31.898
<b> <i>quality of the tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>across the board,</i> </b>

39:31.998 --> 39:33.032
<b>got to vote for Corey.</b>

39:33.132 --> 39:35.334
<b>- As a canvas,</b>
<b>if I had this black area,</b>

39:35.434 --> 39:36.636
<b>my friends would say,</b>

39:36.736 --> 39:38.204
<b>"Hey, man, what's up</b>
<b>with that big black spot?"</b>

39:38.304 --> 39:40.373
<b>I'm not gonna go,</b>
<b>"Yeah, but check out how smooth</b>

39:40.473 --> 39:42.308
<b>and saturated it is."</b>

39:42.408 --> 39:43.408
<b>Final decision?</b>

39:43.442 --> 39:46.379
<b>- Corey.</b>
<b>- St. Marq.</b>

39:49.081 --> 39:50.783
<b>- Corey.</b>

39:50.883 --> 39:52.218
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

39:52.318 --> 39:55.955
<b>Corey, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:56.088 --> 39:58.190
<b>- We did see a lot of promise</b>
<b>in your drawing.</b>

39:58.291 --> 40:00.693
<b>Unfortunately, you get this one</b>
<b>chance to try to make it to the</b>

40:00.793 --> 40:02.728
<b>second chance, and you just</b>
<b>didn't make it, man.</b>

40:02.828 --> 40:06.265
<b>- Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and close shop.</b>
