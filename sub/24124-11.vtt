WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:08.708 --> 01:11.000
Whoa!

01:14.500 --> 01:16.875
Oh! Eee!

01:19.083 --> 01:20.750
Eee!

01:23.000 --> 01:24.875
Yaah!

01:25.875 --> 01:28.833
Oh, my g-g-goodness.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.166
Ohh. Yow!

01:37.375 --> 01:41.500
Oh! W-What a blustery morning.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.291
It must be Windsday again.

01:44.291 --> 01:46.416
Oh, bother.

01:46.416 --> 01:48.291
Yaah!

01:51.125 --> 01:55.458
Funny. The wind seems
to sound just like Piglet.

01:58.458 --> 02:00.333
Oh, d-d-dear.

02:00.333 --> 02:04.333
I do hope Rabbit is in
the m-m-mood for visitors.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.250
Ahh.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.166
Ah.

02:09.166 --> 02:13.708
There's nothing cozier
than the wind outside

02:13.708 --> 02:19.500
and me nice, warm,
and comfortable inside.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.500
I wonder who that could be.

02:27.458 --> 02:30.000
Is there something
I can do for you?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.458
Yes.

02:31.458 --> 02:36.833
Help, Rabbit!

02:36.833 --> 02:42.375
Now, Piglet, you come
down here at once!

02:44.208 --> 02:46.708
If I could come down,
I wouldn't be up.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.125
Yaah!

02:53.000 --> 02:56.166
Why does this always
happen to me?

02:58.458 --> 03:00.583
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

03:00.583 --> 03:03.291
Look, Mama,
the flapjacks are flying.

03:03.291 --> 03:06.708
Now, Roo, don't
let your breakfast
play with you.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.625
Well, they taste better
when they're moving.

03:12.875 --> 03:15.708
Look, there's a piglet
on out window.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.166
Where? Where?

03:18.166 --> 03:20.166
I don't see any piglet.

03:20.166 --> 03:24.000
Ha! Probably one of them
unidentified flying omelets.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.625
Yaah!

03:30.000 --> 03:33.458
Home, sweet home!

03:37.708 --> 03:40.875
I'm never going out
into that wind again.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.833
No. I'm not coming out.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.625
It's-- It's too dangerous

03:47.625 --> 03:49.500
for such very small animals

03:49.500 --> 03:51.458
in all that very large wind.

03:51.458 --> 03:54.500
But you can't stay under
there forever, Piglet.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.875
Yes. Just listen, Piglet.

03:56.875 --> 04:00.583
Doesn't it seem that the wind
is a little more winsome

04:00.583 --> 04:03.708
and a little less windsome?

04:03.708 --> 04:06.250
Oh. Do you think so, Pooh?

04:06.250 --> 04:08.458
Yes, Piglet. I know so.

04:08.458 --> 04:13.708
In fact, why don't we just
open up this window and--

04:13.708 --> 04:15.291
- No!
- No!

04:15.291 --> 04:16.833
Yaah!

04:16.833 --> 04:20.083
You see, Piglet, nothing
to be worried about.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.000
Piglet?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.125
- Yeee!
- Piglet?

04:23.125 --> 04:24.583
Hmm.

04:24.583 --> 04:27.958
Oh, this is more serious
than I thought.

04:27.958 --> 04:33.958
What we need is a plan
to get Piglet out from under.

04:33.958 --> 04:36.875
Tigger:
You sure this is gonna
work, buddy bear?

04:36.875 --> 04:41.291
Of course, Tigger.
How can Piglet resist?

04:41.291 --> 04:44.833
And once he sees there's
nothing to worry about--

04:46.416 --> 04:48.166
Who, uh...

04:48.166 --> 04:50.083
w-w-who is it?

04:50.083 --> 04:53.416
Pooh: It's a telegram
for Piglet.

04:53.416 --> 04:55.083
But Piglet who?

04:55.083 --> 04:57.750
The Piglet who lives
at this house

04:57.750 --> 05:00.291
and is hiding
under his chair.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.833
Oh. It must be for me.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.833
He's falling for it,
Pooh boy.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.250
--

05:10.250 --> 05:12.166
uh, c-coming.

05:12.166 --> 05:15.125
Shh, shh. He's coming.
He's coming.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.458
Yaah!

05:24.458 --> 05:26.000
Piglet.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.875
Well, we'll just have
to try another approach,

05:29.875 --> 05:32.125
a more underhanded one.

05:32.125 --> 05:35.458
Or should I say underground?

05:40.583 --> 05:44.208
Now remember,
stick close to me.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.708
The worst thing
in tunnel excavation

05:46.708 --> 05:48.500
is losing your bearings.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.416
We don't want to lose
our tiggerings

05:50.416 --> 05:52.000
or rabbitings, either.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.416
Enough lollygagging.

05:53.416 --> 05:55.000
Time to get to work.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.333
It's a long way to Tipperary.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.083
Tipperary?

05:59.083 --> 06:02.000
But Piglet doesn't live
in Tipperary.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.000
Gopher: Uh, need
to make a right turn.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.583
Gopher: This is it--

06:30.583 --> 06:33.458
directly under Piglet's house.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.500
Rabbit: Whatever we do next,

06:45.500 --> 06:48.583
I hope it's a little
less...moist.

06:48.583 --> 06:52.291
Well, since Piglet's
not coming out

06:52.291 --> 06:54.583
and we can't get him out,

06:54.583 --> 06:57.291
there's only one thing
left to do.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.416
You mean?

06:59.416 --> 07:01.208
Yes, Rabbit.

07:01.208 --> 07:05.750
We must give Piglet
a staying inside party.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.750
It's like
a going away party...

07:08.750 --> 07:10.333
only different.

07:13.708 --> 07:16.583
Silly hat. Oh, ouch.

07:16.583 --> 07:20.583
Oh, yes. Reminds me
of my great-uncle Waldo,

07:20.583 --> 07:22.083
the homing pigeon.

07:22.083 --> 07:25.250
Mistook a closet
for the front door.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.416
Didn't find his way out
for three years.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.125
Want to come out
and join the fun, Piglet?

07:34.125 --> 07:35.750
Not especially.

07:35.750 --> 07:39.125
If you ask me,
it sounds pretty silly

07:39.125 --> 07:40.458
missing your own party.

07:40.458 --> 07:43.750
He's just being afraid.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.000
It's the wind, you know.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.708
Piglet, make a wish.

07:49.708 --> 07:52.000
I wish I never had
to come out of here again.

07:53.375 --> 07:57.208
Mama, if I hide
under the chair--

07:57.208 --> 07:59.958
-- can I
eat cake all the time?

07:59.958 --> 08:01.625
No, dear.

08:01.625 --> 08:04.500
You'd have to have
ice cream, too.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.208
Piglet was a good friend,

08:08.208 --> 08:11.458
whenever he bothered
to be around.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.833
Yeah.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.125
I'm going to miss
the little guy.

08:18.708 --> 08:23.000
Piglet, we've a gift
to remember us by.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.458
It's a pinwheel.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.083
Oh.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.375
Thank you, Pooh.

08:30.416 --> 08:31.875
Are you coming, Pooh?

08:34.375 --> 08:36.416
Goodbye, Piglet.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.083
Goodbye, everyone.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.458
Goodbye.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.083
Mm. Mm.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.875
Mm.

08:53.708 --> 08:56.000
Ah. I remember

08:56.000 --> 08:59.208
when we used to push
Piglet in this swing.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.875
Yeah. The little guy
would be yelling,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.416
so happy.

09:03.416 --> 09:07.708
Then he'd go higher
and higher and higher

09:07.708 --> 09:10.458
until he just flew out.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.166
-Yaah!
-

09:12.166 --> 09:14.291
I wonder if he misses that.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.250
I do.

09:16.250 --> 09:20.750
Oh, this sunset's
really colorous.

09:20.750 --> 09:24.125
Too bad
Piglet missed it.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.250
Good night, Piglet.

09:27.250 --> 09:30.500
Good night--
-- Pooh Bear.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.583
The wind's worse than before.

09:41.583 --> 09:45.583
It's no use. The only safe
place is under my chair.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.083
Oh, dear.

09:48.083 --> 09:51.208
What's Pooh doing out
in this terrible weather?

09:52.416 --> 09:56.083
Oh, bother!

09:56.083 --> 09:57.708
Oh, no.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.000
Oh, my goodness.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.875
Oh, my goodness' goodness.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.583
Whoops!

10:11.583 --> 10:13.125
Pooh!

10:13.125 --> 10:17.291
Sometimes a scarf is a very
useful thing to have.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.583
Uh-oh!

10:27.625 --> 10:29.125
Oh, no!

10:29.125 --> 10:31.333
I'm coming, Pooh Bear!

10:32.333 --> 10:34.833
Hang on, Pooh! Ooh!

10:40.083 --> 10:41.166
Pooh!

10:43.708 --> 10:47.458
Q-Q-Quick!
T-T-Take my hand!

10:47.458 --> 10:49.583
Why, thank you, Piglet.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.708
Whew.

11:00.708 --> 11:05.333
Well, Piglet, I was coming
to save you from the wind,

11:05.333 --> 11:08.333
but you used the wind
to save me.

11:08.333 --> 11:12.750
It seems the wind's
not telling you
you're scared anymore.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.166
Oh. That's true, Pooh.

11:15.166 --> 11:19.583
Aw. But your going away
present is ruined.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.416
I don't need a going away
present anymore

11:22.416 --> 11:24.583
because I'm back, Pooh.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.166
I'm very back.

11:26.166 --> 11:28.833
I'm glad, Piglet.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.166
I'm very glad.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.000
Oh, my. It's 16:00.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.458
Whoops.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.708
Oh, bother.

11:59.708 --> 12:02.500
Good morning, Pooh-- Ooh!

12:02.500 --> 12:04.291
Why, hello, Piglet.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.833
You're just in time.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.958
A-Are you all right, Pooh?

12:11.958 --> 12:15.500
Yes, I am, this time.
See?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.250
Why, Pooh,
your watch has no hands.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.750
That's what makes it
so easy to tell time.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.875
Ouch!

12:21.875 --> 12:23.083
What is it, Pooh?

12:23.083 --> 12:24.250
It's a marble

12:24.250 --> 12:26.458
that looks very much
like a tooth.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.958
It's a tooth that looks
very much like a tooth.

12:28.958 --> 12:29.958
Where'd it come from?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.583
I don't know, Piglet.

12:31.583 --> 12:35.291
I just bumped into the wall,
and here it was.

12:35.291 --> 12:39.000
Uh, no. Here it was.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Actually, it's very good
at being found, Piglet.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.500
I'll prove it.

12:44.500 --> 12:48.458
I choose this one.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.208
Oh, bother.

12:50.208 --> 12:53.125
Uh, you choose, Piglet.

12:53.125 --> 12:56.000
Uh, th-th-this one?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.583
Hmm.

12:57.583 --> 12:58.875
How'd you know?

12:58.875 --> 13:00.416
Simple, Pooh.

13:00.416 --> 13:02.166
You just look
in the last place first.

13:02.166 --> 13:05.291
Uh, anyway, I think we'd
better ask Rabbit about it.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.125
You might have knocked out
your eye tooth.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.458
It would be my nose tooth

13:09.458 --> 13:11.583
because that's
what hit the wall.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.291
Well, this isn't an eye tooth

13:15.291 --> 13:16.750
or a nose tooth.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.000
Well, that's a relief.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.375
Aha!

13:19.375 --> 13:22.875
Have you eaten any honey
since you found this?

13:22.875 --> 13:24.958
Why, no.

13:24.958 --> 13:27.625
Then this is your...

13:27.625 --> 13:29.125
sweet tooth.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.500
And you won't be able
to eat any honey

13:32.500 --> 13:33.583
till it's back.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.625
No honey?

13:35.625 --> 13:37.875
Whatever shall we do?

13:37.875 --> 13:42.000
Well, there's only
one thing to do.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.166
String.

13:43.166 --> 13:44.375
String.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.625
Tooth.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.833
Tooth.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.458
- Done.
-

13:50.458 --> 13:52.458
Well? What do you think?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.750
Rabbit,
how will he chew?

13:57.458 --> 14:00.416
Never mind this.
I have a better idea.

14:04.625 --> 14:07.291
No better place
to plant a sweet tooth

14:07.291 --> 14:08.583
and watch it grow.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.000
Yow!

14:10.000 --> 14:12.875
Unless, of course,
I dug too deep

14:12.875 --> 14:15.708
and that tooth fell into
one of Gopher's tunnels,

14:15.708 --> 14:18.000
which I've told him
a million times

14:18.000 --> 14:19.708
not to dig under my garden!

14:19.708 --> 14:22.333
Hmm! You were saying?

14:22.333 --> 14:24.208
Uh, we're sorry,
Gopher,

14:24.208 --> 14:27.375
but we're looking
for my sweet tooth.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.708
Tooth, is it?

14:28.708 --> 14:31.166
That thing came dropping
down out of nowhere!

14:31.166 --> 14:32.875
Nearly busted my helmet.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.250
Well, come on, then.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.875
It's down here
in my workshop.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.208
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

15:12.000 --> 15:13.708
Gopher: Bunch of
bothersome busybodies,

15:13.708 --> 15:16.458
if you ask me. What next?

15:16.458 --> 15:20.291
Ah, tooth, teeth, snappers.
What's all the fuss?

15:20.291 --> 15:22.125
I keep mine
by my bedside.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.000
Easier to keep track
of, sonny. .

15:25.000 --> 15:27.583
I've been robbed!

15:27.583 --> 15:28.833
Pack rats.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.250
They steal you blind

15:30.250 --> 15:32.208
and leave walnuts
in exchange.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.250
Little varmints.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.458
And they got
your little tooth, too.

15:36.458 --> 15:41.166
No tooth? No honey!

15:41.166 --> 15:43.250
Well, they're not
very neat thieves.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.416
Uh, perhaps we should
follow them?

15:45.416 --> 15:47.291
You're right, sonny.

15:47.291 --> 15:48.958
After them!

15:57.958 --> 15:59.333
Both: Huh?

16:07.583 --> 16:10.958
Owl: I say,
what's all this, then?

16:10.958 --> 16:13.458
Oh, demolition work, eh?

16:13.458 --> 16:16.000
Ha ha. Fascinating.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.458
Had an aunt once

16:17.458 --> 16:20.458
who built a nest
in the top of an elevator.

16:20.458 --> 16:23.458
But her life was
full of ups and downs.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.958
Oh, I say,

16:26.958 --> 16:28.833
this is a pretty bauble.

16:28.833 --> 16:32.000
just what I've
been looking for.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.875
Yes, well, sorry
I have to barge off.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.708
Do join me for tea if you're
ever in the neighborhood.

16:37.708 --> 16:38.750
Thank you.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.375
Come on!
He's got our tooth!

16:50.833 --> 16:52.833
Aha! We're gaining on them.

16:52.833 --> 16:56.250
Ha! Bring back my stuff!

16:56.250 --> 16:58.291
And my tooth!

16:59.625 --> 17:03.625
Hmm. They have to be
around here somewhere.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.708
Uh, Pooh, get up there
and warn Owl

17:06.708 --> 17:08.833
there are thieves around.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.708
Uh, Piglet,
you look for the tooth.

17:10.708 --> 17:11.875
Yipes!

17:11.875 --> 17:15.208
Oh, I do hope
Friend Owl is home.

17:17.708 --> 17:20.875
Oh, hello!
Come for tea already?

17:20.875 --> 17:24.000
Oh, yes, yes. The doorbell
certainly looks nice

17:24.000 --> 17:28.083
since I installed that
lovely, uh, whatever it is.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.458
This certainly
looks familiar.

17:32.458 --> 17:36.333
Pooh Bear!
Just in time for tea.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.333
Uh, did you come alone?

17:38.333 --> 17:39.458
No, but--

17:39.458 --> 17:40.625
Of course you didn't.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.958
Hello, Rabbit!

17:42.958 --> 17:45.000
And is that Gopher, too?

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Excuse me, Owl, but where
did you get this?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.583
Oh, I just found it
lying about someplace.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.708
That sounds like my tooth,
all right.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.583
Oh, bother.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.708
Yahoo!

18:02.708 --> 18:04.750
- Hoo!

18:04.750 --> 18:06.250
Whoa!

18:06.250 --> 18:07.291
Ooh!

18:08.708 --> 18:11.708
Oh, d-d-dear.

18:11.708 --> 18:12.708
Come out, come out.

18:12.708 --> 18:14.458
We got to get out of here.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.708
Come on, Rabbit.
They've got my tooth.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.708
And my friend Piglet.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.500
I'm right behind you.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.000
Whoa!

18:24.333 --> 18:26.416
Piglet: Help! Help!

18:30.625 --> 18:34.291
Uh, will someone please
turn on the lights?

18:34.291 --> 18:37.625
Whoa!

18:45.833 --> 18:47.583
Come on, you guys!

18:47.583 --> 18:49.958
Be brave, Rabbit.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.625
It's for Piglet.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.166
After you.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.000
Yaah!

18:58.000 --> 19:00.958
Piglet: Did I ever mention
I just love walnuts?

19:00.958 --> 19:02.000
All: Huh?

19:05.708 --> 19:07.125
Put me down!

19:07.125 --> 19:08.750
Help!

19:21.291 --> 19:22.625
Ta-da!

19:29.125 --> 19:31.000
Aw!

19:31.000 --> 19:33.416
Piglet: Help, Pooh!

19:33.416 --> 19:35.625
This way!

19:35.625 --> 19:37.875
Pooh! H-H-Help!

19:37.875 --> 19:40.708
I'm coming, Piglet!

19:40.708 --> 19:42.250
Hide! Hide!

19:42.250 --> 19:45.833
Hmm. Been busy little
varmints, haven't they?

19:45.833 --> 19:49.458
Piglet! Where are you?

19:49.458 --> 19:51.083
In here!

19:51.083 --> 19:53.875
Uh, how do we get him out?

19:53.875 --> 19:56.875
Just a little know-how.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.208
Are you all right,
Piglet?

20:06.208 --> 20:08.083
I'm fine, Pooh.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.625
But we'll never find
your tooth in all this.

20:13.583 --> 20:16.000
Looks like it's time
to give up.

20:20.875 --> 20:21.958
Ticky-ticky!

20:21.958 --> 20:23.375
I beg your pardon?

20:23.375 --> 20:24.458
Come on, come on,
come on!

20:24.458 --> 20:25.458
What's the matter,

20:25.458 --> 20:26.708
don't you speak rodent?

20:26.708 --> 20:28.250
They want your watch,

20:28.250 --> 20:30.708
and they'll pay handsomely.

20:33.708 --> 20:35.708
I shall trade it
for my tooth.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.583
He says if you guess
where the tooth is,

20:43.583 --> 20:44.708
you keep it.

20:44.708 --> 20:47.250
If not,
they get the watch.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.708
It's a deal.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.875
I can do this.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.583
I hope.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.250
Remember, Pooh,
last place first.

20:56.250 --> 21:00.583
Well, the last place
I would look

21:00.583 --> 21:02.875
would be behind his back

21:02.875 --> 21:04.708
because that
would be cheating.

21:04.708 --> 21:07.000
So I choose there.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.083
Aw.

21:13.458 --> 21:17.416
And that's how I got
my sweet tooth back.

21:17.416 --> 21:21.458
Ha ha. Silly old bear,
that's not your sweet tooth.

21:21.458 --> 21:23.958
- It's not?
- No.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.875
And even if pooh bears
had teeth,

21:26.875 --> 21:28.416
which they don't,

21:28.416 --> 21:30.625
they wouldn't need
sweet teeth.

21:30.625 --> 21:31.625
No?

21:31.625 --> 21:33.166
Nope.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.458
You're just naturally
sweet all over.

21:38.416 --> 21:39.875
That's true.

21:39.875 --> 21:43.458
This is a baby tooth
I hid with my marbles.

21:43.458 --> 21:46.083
Hey, put it under
your pillow tonight.

21:46.083 --> 21:49.875
Maybe the Tooth Fairy
will trade you for it.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.416
Oh, my!

21:54.166 --> 21:56.458
That's much better
than walnuts.

22:03.333 --> 22:07.625
I wonder if the Tooth Fairy
is related to pack rats.
