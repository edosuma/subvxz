WEBVTT

01:51.000 --> 01:52.500
Don't do this to me, boss.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.400
Come on, don't do this to me.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.800
Don't make me kiss you, boss.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.400
Come on, boss!

02:08.699 --> 02:09.699
Come on!

02:17.700 --> 02:19.000
Boss, come on.

03:18.000 --> 03:18.765
No.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.000
- Please, please, please, Gibbs.
- No.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.600
Okay,

03:22.700 --> 03:24.500
I'll never ask you for
anything again, ever.

03:24.535 --> 03:25.900
- Abby...
- I promise.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.200
Come on, ever?

03:27.300 --> 03:28.565
Well, okay, maybe not ever,

03:28.600 --> 03:31.300
but I won't ask for anything
else for at least like...

03:31.700 --> 03:32.700
a week.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.700
Sure. Where and when?

03:35.100 --> 03:36.300
Here and now.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.100
Boss...

03:38.700 --> 03:40.700
There is a young women
here waiting to see you.

03:40.735 --> 03:42.017
I sent her to the lounge.

03:42.052 --> 03:43.300
- Name?
- Maddie Tyler?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.600
About?

03:44.700 --> 03:46.000
Twenty-two, twenty-three.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.700
Sorry. Personal.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.800
She wouldn't say.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Gibbs!

03:55.900 --> 03:58.100
It's for my cell phone,
so when Gibbs calls,

03:58.200 --> 03:59.465
his face will appear,

03:59.500 --> 04:00.800
and I'll know it's him. See?

04:02.100 --> 04:03.700
Nice... print.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
Hi.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.800
Special Agent Gibbs.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.700
I know.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.800
I - I mean, I remember.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.000
But you...

04:26.200 --> 04:27.600
probably don't. I'm...

04:27.700 --> 04:28.700
Maddie.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.800
Maddie Tyler.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.600
It's been a long time.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.600
I used to come over to your house.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.000
I was Kelly's best friend.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.200
Or, I mean, at least I remember myself

04:43.500 --> 04:44.700
being her best friend.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.400
I like to think she thought so, too.

04:48.700 --> 04:49.700
You lived on base?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Marine brat.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.300
My dad was an Officer.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.900
I remember.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
A good man.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.800
He retired.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.100
Moved back to Oakland.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.800
Died a couple years ago.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.400
I'm finishing my degree at Georgetown.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
Science.

05:09.900 --> 05:10.900
I guess you're

05:11.200 --> 05:12.250
wondering...

05:12.285 --> 05:13.300
why I'm here.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.600
This is going to sound so stupid.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
I can't believe,

05:19.000 --> 05:20.100
I need some help,

05:20.300 --> 05:22.900
and you're the only person I know

05:23.900 --> 05:24.800
who...

05:24.835 --> 05:25.835
Problems?

05:26.100 --> 05:27.400
Guy problems.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.100
Crazy guy problems.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.600
I went on a couple dates with him,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.400
about 18 months ago.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
He's a Marine.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.600
Went to Iraq.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.300
Just got back a week ago.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.900
He came to see me, you know, wanted

05:42.300 --> 05:43.600
to get things started again.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.765
But I mean, there was...

05:46.800 --> 05:50.100
there was nothing to start because
nothing had ever gotten started.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.900
I tried to explain that, but,

05:52.400 --> 05:53.700
kept insisting.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.000
He was

05:55.200 --> 05:56.800
desperate to move in with me,

05:57.100 --> 05:59.000
and, when I said no,

06:01.300 --> 06:02.700
it wasn't what he wanted to hear.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.900
He stalking you?

06:05.300 --> 06:06.700
Did you report him to the police?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.400
They said there's nothing they can do.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.800
It's only been a week.

06:09.900 --> 06:10.900
He threaten you?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
He hurt you?

06:16.500 --> 06:17.900
I don't think he meant to.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.000
He just kind of grabbed me, but...

06:20.200 --> 06:21.600
He's really freaking me out.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.600
What's this Marine's name?

06:23.900 --> 06:24.865
Rudi Haas.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.100
Where would I find him?

06:26.400 --> 06:27.700
Outside my house.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
Cute!

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Pretty!

06:40.200 --> 06:41.200
Tony.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.000
That's the best yet.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100
Boss!

06:47.900 --> 06:49.300
I didn't know you were...

06:50.200 --> 06:51.300
Sorry, Gibbs.

06:55.300 --> 06:59.100
We need to talk about the latest
East African threat assessments.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.800
When you've got a moment.

07:11.700 --> 07:12.700
Know her?

07:12.800 --> 07:13.900
Wish I could say I did.

07:13.935 --> 07:15.000
Maddie Tyler.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.400
- Who is?
- Ask McGee.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.200
- Said it was personal.
- New girlfriend?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.000
Too young. Not a redhead.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.000
Niece?

07:21.100 --> 07:23.100
Nice. McGeek called McGoogle,

07:23.200 --> 07:24.300
her name.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.600
I can do you one better.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.700
MySpace.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.000
Well, she has an
eclectic taste in music.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.400
Everything from Yo-Yo Ma to Metallica.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.500
Lots of friends, college kids mainly.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.100
And one from her childhood.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.900
"My first and still
my best friend, Kelly.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.400
Forever in my memory."

07:44.800 --> 07:46.400
Gibbs' daughter was named Kelly.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.700
One and the same.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.700
Mystery solved.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.900
That's his car.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.500
Hey, Madds, I was just
looking for you, babe.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.535
Look. Hey...

08:15.700 --> 08:16.700
Hey!

08:17.900 --> 08:18.900
Who are you?!

08:19.100 --> 08:20.300
This your old man?!

08:21.300 --> 08:23.200
She does not want to see you.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.200
It means you're not going to come back.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.800
You're not going to call her.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.500
You're not going to
drive down her street.

08:32.984 --> 08:34.284
Do I need to say it again?

08:34.335 --> 08:35.335
No.

08:58.599 --> 09:00.899
OK. It's around here somewhe.

09:01.099 --> 09:02.399
Do you want some more coffee?

09:04.899 --> 09:06.399
Nope. Fine.

09:06.899 --> 09:10.099
As soon as I graduate, I
am moving back to Oakland.

09:10.199 --> 09:11.999
This place is such a pig sty.

09:12.599 --> 09:14.599
There's this really great
animal hospital there.

09:15.299 --> 09:17.099
They offered me a job in the lab.

09:18.599 --> 09:19.899
It's just a general practice.

09:19.999 --> 09:22.899
Eventually, I have plan
to specialize in horses.

09:23.199 --> 09:25.199
Kelly and I were both
crazy about horses.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.499
Here it is.

09:29.799 --> 09:31.899
Can't remember who took that photo.

09:50.099 --> 09:51.199
I did.

09:52.399 --> 09:54.599
I never did find out what was so funny.

09:55.999 --> 09:57.199
She never told you?

10:00.699 --> 10:01.699
Sorry.

10:02.899 --> 10:04.799
I shipped out to Iraq that month.

10:05.699 --> 10:07.599
They followed me all
the way to Pendleton.

10:09.299 --> 10:10.399
Last time I saw them.

10:13.599 --> 10:14.699
It was a time capsule.

10:15.499 --> 10:17.499
We've filled this

10:17.599 --> 10:19.899
toy suitcase with all of our...

10:20.999 --> 10:22.099
treasures.

10:22.199 --> 10:23.299
Kelly's mostly,

10:23.699 --> 10:25.199
and...

10:25.299 --> 10:27.099
buried it in your backyard.

10:29.699 --> 10:30.799
We were sitting on it.

10:36.299 --> 10:37.799
I never stopped crying.

10:40.799 --> 10:43.299
Still think about her,
after all these years.

10:45.499 --> 10:46.799
Wonder what she'd be like.

10:48.799 --> 10:49.799
Like you.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.499
Here, you should.

11:00.199 --> 11:01.364
You should have this.

11:01.399 --> 11:02.899
No. No, that's your memory.

11:04.299 --> 11:05.299
Our memory.

11:13.099 --> 11:14.099
I should be going.

11:14.599 --> 11:15.699
Thanks for the coffee.

11:17.799 --> 11:18.899
That bad?

11:20.699 --> 11:22.699
I really can't thank you enough.

11:24.099 --> 11:25.799
You got my number. He comes back...

11:26.299 --> 11:27.299
call me.

11:32.499 --> 11:33.799
And you keep this locked.

11:41.099 --> 11:42.099
I just...

11:42.899 --> 11:43.999
I - I gotta go.

11:49.899 --> 11:51.999
Marine Sergeant Rudi M. Haas.

11:52.099 --> 11:54.264
Works in logistics,
currently on a 30-day

11:54.299 --> 11:56.899
leave after returning
from Iraq eight days ago.

11:56.999 --> 11:58.399
- Service record?
- Clean.

11:58.499 --> 11:59.464
Eight years in.

11:59.499 --> 12:01.064
Prior to that, grew up in Chicago.

12:01.099 --> 12:03.099
State and local police.
See if he's got a record.

12:03.134 --> 12:04.399
Why do we need to know?

12:04.799 --> 12:07.399
Are we opening an investigation
into Sergeant Haas?

12:07.799 --> 12:08.849
Background check.

12:08.884 --> 12:09.899
On what grounds?

12:09.934 --> 12:10.934
Stalking.

12:11.699 --> 12:13.899
The young woman that
was in this afternoon?

12:14.099 --> 12:15.599
Did she file a complaint?

12:15.699 --> 12:16.699
No.

12:19.099 --> 12:20.699
Is this personal, Jethro?

12:21.199 --> 12:23.599
If you're asking do I know
her, the answer is yes.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.799
Is it personal?

12:26.199 --> 12:27.199
No.

12:34.699 --> 12:35.699
Do it.

12:38.599 --> 12:39.664
She knew.

12:39.699 --> 12:40.864
Reads Gibbs like a book.

12:40.899 --> 12:42.399
Short read, not a lot of dialogue.

12:42.434 --> 12:43.364
Your kind of book.

12:43.399 --> 12:44.699
You suggesting I don't read?

12:44.899 --> 12:47.399
I think she's suggesting you
only look at the pictures, Tony.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.199
A picture paints a
thousand words, McGee.

12:49.299 --> 12:52.299
And in your case, most are
the names of female body parts.

12:53.099 --> 12:54.864
I'll have you know that since 1981,

12:54.899 --> 12:57.899
I've been a loyal subscriber
to National Geographic magazine.

12:58.399 --> 13:00.799
That's some serious
picture-gazing right there.

13:00.899 --> 13:01.999
So how did she know?

13:02.299 --> 13:03.299
Woman's intuition.

13:03.399 --> 13:04.499
Do you have that?

13:04.799 --> 13:06.199
Forget I asked that question.

13:06.499 --> 13:09.299
The Director could see Gibbs
was preoccupied with something,

13:09.499 --> 13:11.564
and she saw him with the girl.

13:11.599 --> 13:13.799
Sounds more like male logic
than woman's intuition.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.599
Either way, I think
she's worried about him.

13:15.634 --> 13:16.999
Question is, should we be?

14:03.699 --> 14:06.899
Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

14:07.899 --> 14:10.599
Papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird.

14:10.634 --> 14:11.699
Pony!

14:30.499 --> 14:33.599
And if that mocking bird don't sing.

14:33.799 --> 14:36.999
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

14:37.399 --> 14:40.399
If that diamond ring turns brass.

14:41.099 --> 14:43.799
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.

14:54.999 --> 14:58.999
Don't go daddy, please don't go.

15:04.499 --> 15:07.599
If that cart and bull break down,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.799
you're still the prettiest...

15:09.834 --> 15:12.299
little baby in town.

15:18.599 --> 15:19.699
Yeah. Gibbs.

15:19.799 --> 15:21.099
Jethro, he's back!

15:38.599 --> 15:39.999
- No!
- Get in the car!

15:40.099 --> 15:41.349
Let go of me!

15:41.384 --> 15:42.564
Get in the car!

15:42.599 --> 15:44.399
- Shut up and get in!
- No! Somebody help!

15:45.199 --> 15:46.199
Help me!

16:01.401 --> 16:02.401
DiNozzo!

16:02.501 --> 16:03.901
BOLO's out on Haas's car.

16:04.401 --> 16:06.801
His photograph and details are
on their way to Metro Police.

16:06.836 --> 16:07.901
Need her photo, too.

16:07.936 --> 16:09.001
Abby's got one.

16:09.601 --> 16:11.701
From when she was trying to take yours,

16:11.801 --> 16:13.801
earlier. Ziva, you want to call Abby.

16:13.901 --> 16:15.201
Haas's current address.

16:15.501 --> 16:17.501
Assigned to Quantico
as an enlisted trainer,

16:17.601 --> 16:20.301
but he hasn't reported in there
since he got back from Iraq.

16:20.401 --> 16:21.666
Got to be staying somewhere.

16:21.701 --> 16:23.401
No known relatives in the DC area.

16:23.436 --> 16:24.466
Friends then.

16:24.501 --> 16:26.601
I want the address of
every place he's ever lived.

16:27.901 --> 16:29.301
I'm working on it, boss.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.266
Her cell phone?

16:30.301 --> 16:31.501
- Switched off.
- His?

16:31.701 --> 16:34.301
Also switched off, I'm trying
to access his recent calls now.

16:34.601 --> 16:35.601
And?

16:36.101 --> 16:38.401
And I've... well,
I've only just started.

16:38.801 --> 16:40.701
You were going to brief me, weren't you?

16:43.001 --> 16:44.001
She called me.

16:44.101 --> 16:46.401
I got there, place was trashed.

16:47.201 --> 16:49.201
Saw her being pushed into Haas's SUV.

16:49.236 --> 16:50.301
You identified him?

16:50.401 --> 16:51.801
I identified his car.

16:53.001 --> 16:54.601
So you didn't actually see.

16:54.701 --> 16:56.501
Sergeant Haas abducting her?

16:57.001 --> 16:58.301
Maybe it was someone else?

16:58.401 --> 17:00.001
Well, it must have been Haas driving.

17:00.101 --> 17:01.801
Could have been driving.

17:03.301 --> 17:04.300
Best guess.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.165
What else do we know about him?

17:06.201 --> 17:09.501
Haas turned down Uncle Sam's
offer to reenlist last month.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.501
In 60 days, he'll be a former Marine.

17:11.601 --> 17:12.800
Last deployment?

17:13.401 --> 17:16.101
Logistics, worked out of
the Green Zone in Baghdad.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.665
Everything Marine going to or

17:17.701 --> 17:19.800
coming from Iraq channeled
through his department.

17:19.836 --> 17:20.866
Desk jockey.

17:20.901 --> 17:22.501
Got his phone records.

17:24.701 --> 17:25.851
Moderate usage.

17:25.886 --> 17:26.992
Recurring numbers?

17:27.028 --> 17:28.101
There's a few.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.266
15 calls in the last eight days

17:30.301 --> 17:32.501
to a landline in the
name of Maddie Tyler.

17:33.101 --> 17:34.066
Others?

17:34.101 --> 17:36.666
Five incoming from a company here in DC.

17:36.701 --> 17:39.201
It's the first call he received
when he got back from Iraq,

17:39.236 --> 17:41.701
and the last call he got before
he switched off his phone.

17:42.101 --> 17:43.901
"Bordais Security Solutions."

17:44.501 --> 17:45.501
BSS,

17:45.601 --> 17:47.301
a small sized security firm.

17:47.401 --> 17:50.501
With a contract in Iraq, Marine
today, mercenary tomorrow.

17:50.801 --> 17:52.301
Filthy rich the day after.

17:52.401 --> 17:53.901
Looks like Haas was being headhunted.

17:53.936 --> 17:55.166
I need a name, McGee.

17:55.201 --> 17:58.701
CEO is a retired Army
Major, Max Bordais.

17:59.601 --> 18:01.101
Ours is a small company,

18:01.201 --> 18:03.401
Agent Gibbs. Less than 100 employees,

18:04.001 --> 18:05.501
the majority of whom were in Iraq.

18:05.901 --> 18:06.901
Doing what?

18:07.001 --> 18:09.801
Protection details for various VIPs.

18:10.101 --> 18:11.266
Haas doesn't seem like

18:11.301 --> 18:14.001
the highly trained soldier
your company would hire.

18:14.036 --> 18:15.101
He's a paper pusher.

18:15.301 --> 18:16.801
And from what I've been told,

18:16.836 --> 18:18.301
no one pushes paper better.

18:18.801 --> 18:19.766
Signed him up?

18:19.801 --> 18:21.101
Made him a generous offer.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.701
- And?
- He passed.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.601
- He say why?
- No.

18:25.001 --> 18:27.601
Evidently a thousand
dollars a day wasn't enough.

18:28.101 --> 18:29.901
A lot of money for a clerk.

18:30.701 --> 18:32.101
I guess he didn't need the money.

18:33.401 --> 18:34.401
Look,

18:34.701 --> 18:35.801
I did my homework.

18:36.101 --> 18:38.801
Haas is considered one of the
best logistics people in Iraq.

18:38.901 --> 18:40.166
You want it, he'll find it.

18:40.201 --> 18:42.801
"You can't get it through
channels, you get it through Haas."

18:42.836 --> 18:44.201
That's what they say about him.

18:44.401 --> 18:45.401
A guy like that

18:45.601 --> 18:47.801
is worth a dozen of my
highly trained soldiers.

18:47.836 --> 18:48.818
Where is he?

18:48.853 --> 18:49.853
I don't know.

18:50.301 --> 18:51.266
You're lying.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.001
I only have his cell phone number.

18:53.101 --> 18:54.301
Am I under arrest?

18:55.301 --> 18:56.301
No.

19:03.301 --> 19:04.301
Where is he?

19:04.401 --> 19:05.501
Agent Gibbs...

19:08.901 --> 19:10.401
I only talked to him

19:10.436 --> 19:11.701
on the phone.

19:12.201 --> 19:13.501
He didn't want to meet me.

19:13.601 --> 19:15.101
He made it clear

19:15.201 --> 19:17.101
he wasn't looking for a job.

19:19.101 --> 19:20.101
Now,

19:20.701 --> 19:22.301
if you're not going to arrest me,

19:23.101 --> 19:24.601
I'm walking out of here.

19:40.801 --> 19:42.401
Nicely handled, Jethro.

19:43.901 --> 19:44.901
You're right.

19:45.201 --> 19:46.701
He's holding something back.

19:47.201 --> 19:49.501
Then again, he's not
the only one, is he?

19:49.601 --> 19:50.801
You said you knew her.

19:50.901 --> 19:52.001
Family friend.

19:52.201 --> 19:54.001
- When?
- Long time ago.

19:54.101 --> 19:56.401
- How long? Five years, ten years?
- Fifteen.

19:59.901 --> 20:00.901
Are we done here?

20:10.301 --> 20:13.101
I e-mailed Maddie's photo
to state and local police.

20:13.601 --> 20:15.301
I printed you one, too.

20:15.401 --> 20:17.577
Of course, I cropped you out
of the one that I e-mailed.

20:17.601 --> 20:21.001
I just thought that maybe you
would want a copy of the original.

20:22.501 --> 20:24.101
She was Kelly's friend, wasn't she?

20:28.501 --> 20:30.001
We're going to find her, Gibbs.

20:30.201 --> 20:31.201
I know it.

20:32.001 --> 20:33.701
Boss, you might want to see this.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.701
McGee got something.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.466
I plotted all the cell phone calls.

20:37.501 --> 20:39.601
Haas received or made
in the last eight days.

20:39.701 --> 20:42.301
Most were made from his
car as he was driving.

20:42.501 --> 20:44.701
The signal passed from
tower to tower, which

20:44.736 --> 20:46.666
doesn't help us, but three of the calls

20:46.701 --> 20:50.201
were made from the same location,
using the same tower each time.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.166
Now given the range and signal strength,

20:52.201 --> 20:54.701
they could only have been made
from this four-block radius.

20:54.736 --> 20:55.901
A lot of real estate,

20:56.201 --> 20:57.601
Until you add what I found.

20:57.901 --> 20:59.466
Only job Haas ever had in DC

20:59.501 --> 21:01.566
was in the six months
before he joined the Marines.

21:01.601 --> 21:04.701
He worked as a night watchman at
a clothing factory, lived on-site.

21:04.801 --> 21:06.701
The factory closed three years ago.

21:06.736 --> 21:08.101
Puts him right in the zone.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.001
Hear that?

21:39.801 --> 21:40.801
Flies.

22:11.501 --> 22:12.801
Guess we found Haas.

22:23.613 --> 22:25.713
Not quite a stairway to heaven.

22:26.113 --> 22:29.013
Perhaps an elevator to
a less compelling place.

22:30.113 --> 22:31.813
This is he, I take it?

22:32.113 --> 22:32.913
Yup.

22:33.013 --> 22:34.113
Rudi Haas.

22:34.513 --> 22:36.613
Yes, well, when we're
confronted with crucifixion,

22:36.648 --> 22:38.330
we immediately think of the Romans,

22:38.365 --> 22:39.978
but it was used as a form of execution

22:40.013 --> 22:42.713
long before them by the
Egyptians and the Greeks,

22:42.748 --> 22:44.913
and after them, by the Persians,

22:44.948 --> 22:46.413
and then, of course,

22:46.813 --> 22:48.078
- the Japanese.
- Duck,

22:48.113 --> 22:49.424
I don't got a whole
lot of time on this one.

22:49.448 --> 22:51.113
Yes, I understand, Jethro.

22:51.213 --> 22:53.313
Obviously at first blush,

22:53.413 --> 22:56.113
the uninitiated would
pounce upon the theory

22:56.148 --> 22:58.813
that he was involved
in some sort of macabre

22:58.848 --> 23:01.913
or perhaps demonic ritual,

23:02.113 --> 23:03.113
but we

23:03.313 --> 23:05.513
are not so quick to draw

23:05.713 --> 23:08.213
such an easy conclusion,
are we, Timothy?

23:10.013 --> 23:13.713
Numerous cuts and nicks
on his torso and face.

23:13.748 --> 23:16.513
Significant bruising of the left arm.

23:16.713 --> 23:19.563
Coloration indicates that this bruise

23:19.598 --> 23:22.413
predates these more recent wounds.

23:22.713 --> 23:23.813
Yeah, someone

23:24.113 --> 23:26.913
gripped him, vicelike, and squeezed.

23:27.113 --> 23:29.613
Yeah, that would have been me, Duck.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.013
I'll go see how the others are doing.

23:38.713 --> 23:39.913
No, Jethro,

23:40.713 --> 23:41.713
I think

23:41.913 --> 23:44.913
in this case, there
is a totally mundane,

23:44.948 --> 23:47.030
though no-less-sickening reason

23:47.065 --> 23:49.113
that he was nailed to the floor.

23:50.413 --> 23:53.013
They didn't want him to
struggle while they tortured him.

23:54.513 --> 23:55.613
Time of death?

23:55.648 --> 23:56.713
Well, now,

23:57.213 --> 24:00.013
that is another problem.

24:00.113 --> 24:01.913
Well, not for me, but for you.

24:02.313 --> 24:04.013
Rigor is fully set.

24:05.013 --> 24:07.913
He's as stiff as the boards
to which he is nailed,

24:08.113 --> 24:10.613
indicating a time of death at least

24:10.913 --> 24:12.313
12 hours ago.

24:13.613 --> 24:16.713
I'm afraid Sergeant Haas
was already long dead

24:17.313 --> 24:19.313
when Maddie Tyler was abducted.

24:23.013 --> 24:24.478
Guy comes back from Iraq,

24:24.513 --> 24:27.013
starts stalking a girl he barely knows,

24:27.113 --> 24:29.213
trashes her apartment,
and then abducts her?

24:29.248 --> 24:30.313
Didn't abduct her.

24:30.713 --> 24:31.713
Didn't abduct her?

24:31.813 --> 24:32.913
Already dead.

24:33.313 --> 24:34.413
Tortured first.

24:34.813 --> 24:36.213
He gave them Maddie's address.

24:36.313 --> 24:37.678
They trashed her apartment.

24:37.713 --> 24:40.013
Apparently, they did not find
what they were looking for.

24:40.048 --> 24:41.213
So they abducted her.

24:41.513 --> 24:42.478
Whoever they are.

24:42.513 --> 24:43.913
She must know something.

24:45.013 --> 24:46.413
Or have something they want.

24:47.213 --> 24:48.313
McGee.

24:50.513 --> 24:52.113
It's a GPS locator, boss.

24:52.213 --> 24:53.813
Real time, wired into the radio.

24:55.813 --> 24:57.913
Our stalker was being stalked.

25:04.613 --> 25:07.078
You're always welcome down here, Jethro,

25:07.113 --> 25:09.513
- but I've barely started.
- I'll take whatever you got.

25:10.213 --> 25:11.213
Well...

25:12.213 --> 25:14.313
nothing confirmed at this point.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.378
No fatal wounds.

25:16.413 --> 25:19.013
And there was very little
blood loss at the scene.

25:19.113 --> 25:22.713
So we can rule out stabbing,
bludgeoning and gunshots.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.613
No signs of strangulation.

25:26.313 --> 25:28.113
There does appear to be some

25:28.213 --> 25:29.713
petechial hemorrhaging,

25:30.113 --> 25:32.513
which suggests asphyxia.

25:32.548 --> 25:33.548
Someone...

25:34.013 --> 25:36.213
could have smothered him with a pillow

25:36.513 --> 25:39.313
or clamped a hand over
his nose and mouth.

25:43.513 --> 25:47.013
She was abducted more
than six hours ago.

25:47.048 --> 25:48.048
Your point?

25:49.413 --> 25:51.313
Well, there's a strong
possibility that...

25:53.113 --> 25:55.613
Look, if I have to explain it,

25:56.013 --> 25:57.913
perhaps you are too close to this.

25:58.113 --> 25:59.113
What else?

26:02.213 --> 26:03.613
Swelling of his face.

26:03.713 --> 26:06.013
And then there are
these lumps and bumps.

26:06.048 --> 26:07.130
Could be hives.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.213
Allergic reaction?

26:09.513 --> 26:10.513
Wait a minute.

26:10.613 --> 26:13.313
It could be anaphylactic shock.

26:14.513 --> 26:18.313
Yes, the most severe
form of anaphylaxis occurs

26:18.513 --> 26:20.378
when an allergic response

26:20.413 --> 26:22.713
triggers the release
of large quantities of

26:22.813 --> 26:25.113
immunological mediators.

26:25.313 --> 26:27.813
This leads to systemic

26:27.913 --> 26:29.413
vasodilation.

26:29.613 --> 26:32.013
Yes, my suspicions were correct.

26:32.513 --> 26:34.613
His air passages are all closed up.

26:35.713 --> 26:37.313
Probably dead within minutes.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.813
Allergic to what?

26:39.313 --> 26:40.313
Seafood.

26:41.313 --> 26:43.613
And he wouldn't have
to have eaten any of it.

26:44.113 --> 26:46.713
Merely coming into
contact with it would have

26:46.813 --> 26:48.513
caused his demise.

26:49.513 --> 26:50.613
Jethro,

26:51.813 --> 26:53.613
just who are you trying to save?

27:02.013 --> 27:03.713
I look at her, I see Kelly, Duck.

27:04.913 --> 27:06.113
How it should have been.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.513
Jethro, be careful.

27:10.613 --> 27:11.913
Don't let your...

27:13.813 --> 27:15.013
Some things...

27:15.913 --> 27:17.613
just can't be undone.

27:18.713 --> 27:20.013
I wasn't there then.

27:21.413 --> 27:22.413
I am now.

27:25.213 --> 27:27.613
I don't want to see you, cause
I don't have anything yet.

27:27.648 --> 27:28.930
Working on it as fast as I can,

27:28.965 --> 27:30.189
you know how fast that is nobody's

27:30.213 --> 27:32.713
faster than me. I am the
master of faster, normally,

27:33.013 --> 27:34.613
but there's nothing normal about this.

27:34.648 --> 27:35.813
Do you have my things?

27:36.113 --> 27:38.013
Yes, his clothes and the nails.

27:39.913 --> 27:41.313
We're going to find her, Gibbs.

27:41.513 --> 27:43.913
We're going to find her.
You believe that, right?

27:43.948 --> 27:45.013
Don't answer that.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.513
Forget I asked.

27:46.713 --> 27:47.713
Just...

27:50.713 --> 27:51.713
Okay.

27:53.313 --> 27:55.713
I need all of you to get out of my lab.

27:55.813 --> 27:56.813
Let me do my thing.

27:56.913 --> 27:59.363
I have all these samples
to test and Major Mass Spec

27:59.398 --> 28:01.813
is going to blow up in protest
if I don't blow up first.

28:08.813 --> 28:09.813
Sorry.

28:10.413 --> 28:11.613
This isn't my lab.

28:13.613 --> 28:14.613
I'm going to go.

28:31.613 --> 28:33.878
A high-end item like a GPS locator

28:33.913 --> 28:36.713
I figured the manufacturer would
keep a record of who it was sold to.

28:36.748 --> 28:39.413
Cross-checked the serial
number against their records.

28:39.448 --> 28:40.513
Look who I found.

28:41.913 --> 28:44.613
Makes Maxie Bordais a big fat liar.

28:45.013 --> 28:46.213
And a suspect.

28:46.613 --> 28:47.613
Bring him in.

28:48.413 --> 28:50.313
Soldier of fortune is about to become

28:50.348 --> 28:51.478
soldier of misfortune.

28:51.513 --> 28:54.513
Dogs of war are about to
taste the hair of the dogs.

28:58.313 --> 28:59.278
Think she's alive?

28:59.313 --> 29:00.778
After what they did to Haas,

29:00.813 --> 29:02.513
maybe it'd be best if she was not.

29:06.113 --> 29:07.113
Showtime.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.213
This your subtle way of
sending me a message, Director?

29:10.413 --> 29:12.078
Nothing subtle about it, Mr. Bordais.

29:12.113 --> 29:15.013
You are now officially a suspect
in this murder investigation.

29:16.613 --> 29:17.778
Want to explain that?

29:17.813 --> 29:20.813
GPS locator. Real-time
tracking of target vehicles.

29:20.848 --> 29:21.978
Bought by your company.

29:22.013 --> 29:23.613
Found in Sergeant Haas's car.

29:23.648 --> 29:24.713
Operational.

29:27.513 --> 29:28.613
Wait for it.

29:29.113 --> 29:30.113
Wait for it.

29:32.013 --> 29:33.313
I need to make a phone call.

29:33.413 --> 29:35.013
Some of these guys are so predictable.

29:35.048 --> 29:36.613
First sign of pressure, and they cave.

29:36.713 --> 29:38.113
See that coming a mile way.

29:38.713 --> 29:40.913
A lawyer is not going to help you now.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.813
I'm not calling a lawyer.

29:45.013 --> 29:46.113
Calling the Pentagon.

29:51.713 --> 29:52.813
Like I said,

29:53.013 --> 29:54.413
hair of the dogs.

29:54.913 --> 29:57.213
I was assigned as a special
investigator with SIGIR.

29:57.513 --> 29:58.813
I take it you've heard of us?

29:58.913 --> 30:02.213
Special Inspector General
for Iraqi Reconstruction.

30:02.313 --> 30:03.578
As I'm sure you're aware,

30:03.613 --> 30:05.478
SIGIR was established to audit

30:05.513 --> 30:07.713
funds allocated to
the rebuilding of Iraq.

30:08.013 --> 30:09.078
Unfortunately,

30:09.113 --> 30:11.913
substantial amounts of that
money are unaccounted for.

30:12.113 --> 30:14.713
I heard $8 billion in cash.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.513
$100 notes.

30:16.813 --> 30:18.013
Plane loads of them.

30:19.213 --> 30:21.713
No one denies mistakes
were made, Director.

30:22.313 --> 30:24.313
We're doing the best we
can to recover the money

30:24.348 --> 30:25.913
to return it back to the Iraqi people.

30:26.013 --> 30:27.413
What's that got to do with Haas?

30:27.513 --> 30:28.813
Two of my employees

30:28.913 --> 30:31.163
were suspected of stealing $4 million

30:31.198 --> 30:33.413
from a vault in Baghdad three years ago.

30:34.313 --> 30:35.313
Names?

30:37.013 --> 30:38.713
Danny Coyle, Brian Judd.

30:38.748 --> 30:40.013
Both ex-Army.

30:40.113 --> 30:41.878
- Let go of me!
- Get in the car!

30:41.913 --> 30:43.913
- Shut up and get in!
- Somebody help!

30:44.313 --> 30:45.813
Help me! Help!

30:45.913 --> 30:47.613
While we suspected them,

30:48.113 --> 30:49.413
we never found the money.

30:49.813 --> 30:51.013
Until two weeks ago.

30:51.313 --> 30:52.613
It had never left Iraq.

30:52.813 --> 30:53.778
Couldn't move it.

30:53.813 --> 30:55.578
Finally, they approached Sergeant Haas.

30:55.613 --> 30:57.913
He found a way to smuggle
the money out of the country.

30:58.013 --> 31:00.013
But it appears he got greedy.

31:00.113 --> 31:01.713
No honor among thieves.

31:01.813 --> 31:04.913
Sergeant Haas is the only one who
knows how the money's being shipped.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.113
His tour was up.

31:06.413 --> 31:08.313
He didn't have a lot
of time to organize it.

31:08.413 --> 31:09.613
We think just a few days.

31:10.513 --> 31:12.513
You were tracking him via GPS?

31:12.548 --> 31:13.548
Yes.

31:13.613 --> 31:14.913
And Coyle and Judd?

31:15.113 --> 31:17.713
Until they switched cars 24 hours ago.

31:18.013 --> 31:19.878
We know the money has arrived.

31:19.913 --> 31:22.313
We just have no idea how or where Haas

31:22.348 --> 31:23.613
is planning to collect it.

31:23.913 --> 31:25.113
You know where they are?

31:25.413 --> 31:26.213
No.

31:26.313 --> 31:28.713
- Said you were tracking them.
- We're tracking them.

31:28.813 --> 31:30.713
As I said, we lost them.

31:30.748 --> 31:31.813
Compromised?

31:32.413 --> 31:33.513
We don't believe so.

31:33.713 --> 31:36.013
They're very good at what they do.

31:36.213 --> 31:38.213
Taking counter measures, changing cars,

31:38.413 --> 31:40.713
only turning on cell
phones to check messages.

31:40.748 --> 31:42.513
They abducted a girl this morning.

31:42.548 --> 31:43.613
We know.

31:44.013 --> 31:45.013
You know?

31:45.213 --> 31:47.413
Our surveillance was breaking down,

31:47.448 --> 31:49.613
and we were waiting for more manpower.

31:49.713 --> 31:50.813
You saw it happen.

31:50.913 --> 31:52.613
We couldn't have
stopped it, Agent Gibbs,

31:52.648 --> 31:54.378
and I resent the suggestion

31:54.413 --> 31:56.674
that we placed this operation ahead
of the life of that young woman.

31:56.698 --> 31:58.924
- Where did you lose them?
- I don't have to share that information

31:58.948 --> 31:59.948
- with you.
- Where?

32:00.713 --> 32:02.278
In her apartment, in the street?

32:02.313 --> 32:04.578
The next block? The next
suburb? Where exactly

32:04.613 --> 32:07.313
- did you lose them, Colonel?
- Enough, Agent Gibbs!

32:13.713 --> 32:15.913
- I think we're done here.
- The hell we are!

32:18.613 --> 32:21.578
NCIS is conducting an investigation

32:21.613 --> 32:24.613
into the murder of a
United States Marine,

32:24.648 --> 32:26.113
and I can assure you,

32:26.213 --> 32:28.713
I will bring down the
full weight of this service

32:28.813 --> 32:31.813
if you do not give me
your utmost cooperation.

32:32.013 --> 32:33.813
Do I make myself understood?

32:35.813 --> 32:36.913
Yes, ma'am.

32:38.113 --> 32:39.113
Now...

32:39.813 --> 32:42.213
where exactly did you
lose them, Colonel?

32:43.413 --> 32:44.678
- Hey, DiNozzo.
- Boss.

32:44.713 --> 32:46.313
Abby gets something, you handle it.

32:46.413 --> 32:47.813
No problem, call you right away.

32:48.413 --> 32:49.913
That what I said, DiNozzo?

32:50.313 --> 32:51.313
I'll handle it.

33:07.313 --> 33:08.413
Jethro...

33:11.113 --> 33:12.378
They think Coyle and Judd

33:12.413 --> 33:14.913
might be somewhere down
in the old dock district.

33:15.013 --> 33:16.013
Tell DiNozzo.

33:20.213 --> 33:21.213
Tony...

33:21.513 --> 33:22.513
Director?

33:22.713 --> 33:24.013
Any idea where he's going?

33:24.048 --> 33:24.813
No.

33:24.913 --> 33:26.013
Hazard a guess?

33:26.113 --> 33:28.913
Well, he took his badge and his
gun. Maybe he's gonna shoot someone.

33:29.813 --> 33:30.913
Oh, boy.

33:42.013 --> 33:44.213
This is Coyle. Leave a message.

33:45.313 --> 33:46.513
You want your money,

33:47.205 --> 33:48.505
call me back.

33:54.563 --> 33:56.763
This is ground control to Major McTom.

33:56.798 --> 33:58.963
This is ground control to Major Tom.

33:59.063 --> 34:00.163
Is anybody out there?

34:01.063 --> 34:02.063
What?

34:03.363 --> 34:04.363
I'm just checking.

34:05.163 --> 34:07.663
You've been staring into
space for the last hour.

34:07.698 --> 34:10.128
Even on the McGeeko scale
that's cause for concern.

34:10.163 --> 34:13.163
It's been five minutes, not an
hour, and I'm not staring into space,

34:13.197 --> 34:14.428
I'm staring at the plasma.

34:14.463 --> 34:16.362
- Calling Gibbs?
- He did not pick up.

34:16.398 --> 34:18.163
- Worried about him?
- Are you?

34:18.663 --> 34:19.862
You be worried about him.

34:19.963 --> 34:21.463
I'll be tentatively troubled.

34:22.063 --> 34:23.163
Privately perturbed.

34:23.663 --> 34:24.763
Fleetingly flustered.

34:24.963 --> 34:25.963
Have you called him?

34:26.463 --> 34:30.063
I would have to be deeply
discombobulated to even

34:30.163 --> 34:33.563
think of calling him. Okay, McTim,
you win. What are we looking at?

34:34.362 --> 34:35.362
What do you see?

34:38.063 --> 34:40.563
It's an iceberg, and
we're headed right for it.

34:41.362 --> 34:44.663
More like the $4 million
tip of an $8 billion iceberg.

34:45.063 --> 34:47.763
Forget the $4 million, I'd
settle for finding Maddie.

34:48.463 --> 34:50.963
I've been trying to
figure out where she fits.

34:51.163 --> 34:53.463
- She doesn't.
- For her to have been abducted,

34:53.862 --> 34:55.362
they must think she has the money.

34:55.663 --> 34:57.063
Or can lead them to the money.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.463
If she can, she doesn't know.
She would have told Gibbs.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.263
Maybe she doesn't know she knows.

35:01.763 --> 35:03.763
Sergeant Haas comes back from Iraq,

35:03.963 --> 35:06.863
the first thing he does is try to
move in with a girl he's dated twice.

35:07.263 --> 35:08.463
- Why?
- He's a man.

35:08.763 --> 35:10.663
What does she have that he does not?

35:11.563 --> 35:13.063
- A bed.
- A room.

35:13.363 --> 35:14.663
A place for Haas to stay.

35:15.163 --> 35:16.363
He had a room at Quantico.

35:16.463 --> 35:18.763
So, what does her apartment
have that Quantico doesn't?

35:19.163 --> 35:20.163
Privacy.

35:20.263 --> 35:21.263
No guardhouse.

35:21.363 --> 35:22.363
No car searches.

35:22.863 --> 35:24.063
A street address.

35:24.863 --> 35:26.863
Her apartment has a street address.

35:27.163 --> 35:28.663
Which means mail delivery.

35:28.863 --> 35:30.763
How long takes a letter
to get here from Iraq?

35:30.863 --> 35:33.063
A week. Give or take a day or two.

35:33.163 --> 35:35.163
He's from Chicago. No family here.

35:35.463 --> 35:36.663
No delivery address.

35:37.563 --> 35:40.063
He wasn't stalking her. He was
hanging out to check the mail.

35:40.663 --> 35:42.063
Get down to her apartment.

35:42.163 --> 35:43.263
Find the mailman.

35:50.063 --> 35:51.263
He figured it out.

35:51.363 --> 35:52.663
And he didn't tell us.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.063
You call him?

35:55.863 --> 35:56.863
You?

35:57.463 --> 35:58.563
He didn't pick up.

36:17.763 --> 36:21.128
If that diamond ring turns brass.

36:21.163 --> 36:24.363
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.

36:27.563 --> 36:28.663
Don't go, Daddy.

36:29.063 --> 36:31.163
Please, please don't go.

36:32.963 --> 36:35.563
I still think about her,
after all these years.

36:36.263 --> 36:37.663
Wonder what she'd be like.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.363
Like you.

36:43.463 --> 36:44.763
Excuse me.

36:48.463 --> 36:50.463
Got a registered letter for Rudi Haas.

36:50.963 --> 36:52.363
I need to see some ID.

36:58.563 --> 36:59.663
Don't want to know.

37:18.663 --> 37:19.663
There he is.

37:21.963 --> 37:22.963
Excuse me!

37:23.863 --> 37:26.963
NCIS. We're trying to locate a letter
addressed to Sergeant Rudi Haas.

37:27.563 --> 37:28.663
Just delivered it.

37:28.963 --> 37:29.963
Okay. Thank you.

37:31.263 --> 37:32.763
- How long?
- Five minutes.

37:32.863 --> 37:34.963
He signed for a letter. It appears Haas

37:35.063 --> 37:37.963
shipped the money out of Iraq as the
personal effects of a dead Marine.

37:37.998 --> 37:39.463
Gibbs must have the receipt.

37:39.498 --> 37:40.563
Gone to collect them.

37:40.863 --> 37:41.863
Find him, Ziva.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.263
He beat us to it.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.063
Abby... she's caught a fish.

37:47.363 --> 37:48.663
Atlantic bluefin tuna.

37:49.163 --> 37:50.963
These pallet nails were sticky with it.

37:51.263 --> 37:54.263
The fish oil gets caught in
the spiral shank of the nails,

37:54.363 --> 37:55.663
it dries, it gets gucky.

37:55.763 --> 37:57.263
The more oil, the more gucky.

37:57.363 --> 38:00.663
So they're just layer after
layer after layer of guck.

38:01.463 --> 38:03.963
When they whacked these into his hands,

38:04.263 --> 38:05.763
they were like poison darts.

38:05.863 --> 38:07.363
How common is bluefin tuna?

38:07.663 --> 38:09.363
I checked with the fishing authorities.

38:09.563 --> 38:11.963
There's very few places
that handle it in DC.

38:12.363 --> 38:14.263
Most are at the Maine
Avenue Fish Market.

38:14.763 --> 38:15.763
That's too crowded.

38:15.963 --> 38:17.163
That leaves us with...

38:18.163 --> 38:19.263
Southwestern Marine.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.763
It's down by the old dock.

38:21.163 --> 38:22.663
There was an exporting company there.

38:22.863 --> 38:24.563
It closed down a couple years ago.

38:24.663 --> 38:25.663
Exporting what?

38:26.163 --> 38:27.163
Guck.

38:28.063 --> 38:30.263
I'll get McGee and
Ziva to meet you there.

38:38.163 --> 38:39.763
Has anybody heard from Gibbs?

38:43.063 --> 38:45.363
I called him and he didn't
pick up. He always picks up.

38:48.363 --> 38:49.463
Good work, Abby.

38:55.863 --> 38:56.963
All right.

39:03.363 --> 39:04.863
- You got it?
- I got it.

39:05.163 --> 39:07.163
- All right, then bring it to us.
- Where?

39:07.263 --> 39:09.063
Southwestern Marine,
main storage building.

39:10.063 --> 39:11.963
And make sure it's just you.

39:12.963 --> 39:14.063
On my way.

39:47.363 --> 39:48.563
You okay?

39:48.663 --> 39:49.763
I'm so sorry.

39:50.463 --> 39:51.563
You're her father?

39:51.763 --> 39:53.163
It make a difference if I am?

39:55.363 --> 39:57.063
Not to me. Arms up.

40:00.063 --> 40:01.063
Spread 'em.

40:04.663 --> 40:05.663
He's clean.

40:08.463 --> 40:09.763
Haas said there were two bags.

40:10.563 --> 40:12.163
Other one is in the trunk of my car.

40:12.263 --> 40:13.463
Yeah, it's good.

40:17.263 --> 40:18.663
You get the keys, I get Maddie.

40:20.263 --> 40:21.263
Where's the car?

40:22.063 --> 40:23.163
Downtown parking lot.

40:24.363 --> 40:25.363
I caught a cab.

40:29.063 --> 40:31.163
Then you better find
another cab and go get it.

40:34.663 --> 40:35.663
Get it yourself.

40:42.163 --> 40:43.163
Run!

40:43.663 --> 40:44.663
In the car!

40:44.763 --> 40:45.763
Car!

41:42.984 --> 41:44.184
It's okay, Daddy.

41:46.884 --> 41:47.884
It's okay.

41:49.884 --> 41:50.884
Go back, Daddy.

41:51.384 --> 41:52.384
Go back.

41:52.584 --> 41:53.584
It's okay.

41:53.984 --> 41:54.984
I love you, Daddy.

41:55.684 --> 41:56.684
Love you.

41:56.884 --> 41:57.984
I love you, Daddy.
