00:22.436 --> 00:24.267
The Guyver unit.

00:24.338 --> 00:26.863
It's been a year since the alien armor
invaded my body,

00:26.940 --> 00:29.135
became a part of me.

00:29.209 --> 00:30.938
A year since I first
became the Guyver

00:31.011 --> 00:32.808
and destroyed
the Chronos Corporation

00:32.879 --> 00:35.814
and their shape-changing killers,
the Zoanoids.

00:35.882 --> 00:40.546
Now Chronos is gone,
but the Guyver stays in me,

00:40.620 --> 00:42.781
calling me to fight--

00:42.856 --> 00:43.823
to kill.

00:49.896 --> 00:52.057
Damn.

00:52.132 --> 00:53.565
Hurry up,
find that shit.

01:06.146 --> 01:07.135
Bingo.

01:07.214 --> 01:08.545
Hey, DC.

01:16.289 --> 01:17.415
Dolls?

01:17.491 --> 01:19.823
The latest technology.

01:19.893 --> 01:23.693
You mix cocaine with plastic,
you can shape it into anything you like.

01:25.465 --> 01:28.195
Melt it back down,
it's 100% pure.

01:32.172 --> 01:33.935
What the fuck was that?

01:35.108 --> 01:37.269
- Benny, check it out.
- You got it.

01:40.847 --> 01:43.179
You starting to regret
that career choice now?

01:45.519 --> 01:46.781
There's nobody up here.

01:49.055 --> 01:51.421
All right, girls, come on, let's hustle.
Let's go.

01:51.491 --> 01:53.254
Let's go,
move it.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.060
All set.

02:03.470 --> 02:05.404
Benny, we're rollin'.

02:12.646 --> 02:14.409
Hey, Benny,
I said we're rollin'.

02:25.025 --> 02:26.925
Holy shit.

03:45.171 --> 03:47.332
What the fuck is that?

03:56.082 --> 03:57.549
Let the man go.

03:57.617 --> 04:00.085
Yeah, right.
Fuck you.

04:08.461 --> 04:10.088
Get him!

05:24.104 --> 05:25.765
Shit.

05:32.912 --> 05:36.075
Fuck. Stay away from me, man.
Stay the fuck away from me.

05:37.350 --> 05:39.375
Don't! Oh!
No, please don't.

05:39.452 --> 05:41.386
Please don't.
Please,

05:41.454 --> 05:42.921
don't kill me,
just arrest me.

06:17.157 --> 06:18.522
Holy shit.

06:19.626 --> 06:21.059
This is Delta 28,

06:21.127 --> 06:23.220
we have severely injured men
at 36th and California.

06:23.296 --> 06:25.127
Request ambulance assistance
and back up.

06:34.741 --> 06:36.902
Hey, Moran,
over here.

06:41.848 --> 06:43.406
Shit.

06:43.483 --> 06:45.610
Yeah, it's him, all right.

10:53.933 --> 10:56.458
"inside ExposÃ©,"
in Three Pines, Utah,

10:56.536 --> 10:59.869
to investigate what may be
a werewolf attack.

11:00.907 --> 11:02.772
Doug Kerlew
and his brother Jud

11:02.842 --> 11:05.436
were exploring some caves
above these woods,

11:05.511 --> 11:08.241
when Jud was attacked
and fatally mauled.

11:08.314 --> 11:10.805
Rangers here are calling it
a bear attack,

11:10.883 --> 11:13.716
but Doug has
a different explanation.

11:13.786 --> 11:16.914
Yeah, I mean,
it changed. Yeah.

11:16.990 --> 11:19.322
It was right before my eyes.

11:19.392 --> 11:22.293
It was a man

11:22.362 --> 11:23.590
and then it was a thing,

11:23.663 --> 11:27.292
you see,
with teeth and claws.

11:27.367 --> 11:30.063
Like one of those cave paintings
I showed you come to life.

11:30.136 --> 11:31.535
No, I wasn't drunk.

11:31.604 --> 11:34.095
You people
calling me a liar?

11:34.173 --> 11:37.609
Man,
my brother's dead, man.

11:37.677 --> 11:39.167
That ain't no lie.

11:39.245 --> 11:41.179
When asked to describe
his attacker,

11:41.247 --> 11:43.408
Doug gave us
this drawing,

11:43.483 --> 11:45.417
which he says
is a copy of the painting

11:45.485 --> 11:47.214
found on the cave wall.

11:47.286 --> 11:50.346
This he claims
is what killed Jud Kerlew.

11:50.423 --> 11:54.291
IE went looking for this cave
to verify Doug's story,

11:54.360 --> 11:55.588
and we found it.

11:55.661 --> 11:58.926
But an archeological expedition
investigating the cave

11:58.998 --> 12:02.729
was suspiciously uncooperative
when we asked to shoot inside.

12:02.802 --> 12:06.135
Next up,
more Elvis sightings.

12:12.578 --> 12:16.241
...which he says is a copy
of the painting found on the cave wall.

12:37.970 --> 12:40.871
Hi, Mizky.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.908
Look...

12:42.975 --> 12:45.375
I'm ready to try
to make things better.

12:45.445 --> 12:46.912
I saw the papers
this morning.

12:46.979 --> 12:48.810
It doesn't look
like anything's better.

12:50.383 --> 12:51.975
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

12:52.051 --> 12:54.884
The security guard
died, Sean.

12:54.954 --> 12:56.478
And those gangsters.

12:56.556 --> 12:59.423
How many people are you gonna have
to kill before you realize--

12:59.492 --> 13:00.652
No, I don't kill--

13:02.762 --> 13:03.751
It kills.

13:03.830 --> 13:06.355
Sean, listen to yourself.

13:06.432 --> 13:09.299
You've got to stop this.

13:09.368 --> 13:10.494
It won't let me.

13:10.570 --> 13:12.003
That's crazy.

13:12.071 --> 13:15.438
I know,
and I want to end it.

13:15.508 --> 13:18.102
Will you listen?

13:18.177 --> 13:20.008
There was a thing on TV
this morning

13:20.079 --> 13:22.639
About a werewolf
sighting in Utah.

13:22.715 --> 13:25.411
Werewolves--
Zoanoids.

13:25.485 --> 13:28.113
If you saw
Lisker or Balcus for the first time,

13:28.187 --> 13:29.711
- what would you think?
- God! Stop it!

13:29.789 --> 13:31.188
I don't want
to hear it anymore.

13:31.257 --> 13:33.589
There are
no more Zoanoids.

13:33.659 --> 13:36.025
Chronos is gone.
Can't you let it go?

13:43.469 --> 13:46.836
What's the point
of holding on?

13:46.906 --> 13:50.842
And you go over it and over it,
and you get crazier and crazier.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.935
When do you
just say that--

13:58.684 --> 14:01.175
This isn't gonna work,
is it?

15:09.055 --> 15:10.682
Hey, thanks.

15:31.577 --> 15:34.341
Excuse me, there's an archeological dig
going on near here.

15:34.413 --> 15:35.937
Do you know
where it is?

15:36.015 --> 15:38.006
Customer waitin'.
You gonna buy something?

15:39.385 --> 15:40.909
Uh, yeah.

15:41.988 --> 15:44.616
- Well?
- $1.95.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.492
Do you know how to reach them?
I have to get to that dig.

15:52.298 --> 15:55.631
Don't know nothin'.
Ask down at the rangers.

16:02.775 --> 16:04.504
What do you
want at the dig?

16:05.978 --> 16:07.172
Excuse me?

16:07.246 --> 16:09.840
I said, "what do you want
at the dig?"

16:11.651 --> 16:14.245
- Do you work at the dig?
- Maybe.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.379
- You have business there?
- I have to see it.

16:16.455 --> 16:18.150
You with the press?

16:18.224 --> 16:19.851
It's a private site,
you know.

16:19.925 --> 16:22.393
No, no, I'm not a reporter.
I just need to...

16:23.929 --> 16:24.918
Need to what?

16:26.766 --> 16:28.165
Look...

16:30.303 --> 16:31.930
I've been doing these
for months.

16:32.004 --> 16:34.871
They're like the ones I saw on TV,
the ones from your cave.

16:34.940 --> 16:38.068
See, I see it in my dreams
and I put it down on paper.

16:40.546 --> 16:42.377
Yeah, I know
what it sounds like.

16:55.428 --> 16:56.520
What?

16:56.595 --> 16:57.789
You've seen this?

16:59.165 --> 17:01.156
You've seen this.

17:01.233 --> 17:04.396
I, uh--
I can't help you.

17:04.470 --> 17:05.596
Thanks, Warren.

17:08.406 --> 17:10.897
- Please take me there.
- Sorry, I don't think so.

17:12.545 --> 17:14.911
Wait, I need to know.

17:14.980 --> 17:17.710
I can't,
I'm sorry.

17:19.151 --> 17:21.016
Will you wait
a second?

17:22.855 --> 17:25.085
Would you back away
from the truck, please?

17:26.125 --> 17:28.218
Wait! I need to know!

17:30.830 --> 17:32.320
Damn.

17:47.980 --> 17:48.969
Get in.

18:09.135 --> 18:11.228
I'm Cori Edwards.

18:11.303 --> 18:13.669
I'm a researcher
up at the dig.

18:14.707 --> 18:15.969
And you are...?

18:18.277 --> 18:21.075
Uh, Sean Barker.

18:21.147 --> 18:24.480
Uh-huh.
And...?

18:25.785 --> 18:27.252
Look, I'm sorry,

18:27.319 --> 18:29.184
I didn't mean to freak you
out back there.

18:29.255 --> 18:31.120
It's just...

18:31.190 --> 18:33.021
This is important to me.

18:35.361 --> 18:36.726
Nice to meet you.

18:39.965 --> 18:42.991
So, um...

18:43.068 --> 18:44.365
Why'd you come back?

18:47.807 --> 18:49.274
Because I'm a scientist.

18:49.341 --> 18:51.536
I know what it's like
to need to know.

19:30.282 --> 19:31.306
Thanks.

19:36.689 --> 19:38.384
So, what do you
want to see?

19:39.925 --> 19:41.483
Right.
Come on.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.790
Just be cool
and follow my lead.

19:45.197 --> 19:46.755
Hope I'm not getting
you in trouble.

19:46.832 --> 19:48.629
Not if you do
what I say.

19:52.171 --> 19:53.229
Mary,

19:53.305 --> 19:55.330
take this to the commissary,
will ya?

19:55.407 --> 19:57.034
And don't hog
it all to yourself.

20:03.716 --> 20:07.379
- Morning, Miss Edwards.
- Morning, Grau. He's okay, he's with
me.

20:09.755 --> 20:11.245
Watch your head.

20:11.323 --> 20:13.018
Do all archeological
expeditions

20:13.092 --> 20:14.423
have this
much security?

20:14.493 --> 20:17.155
We didn't until your buddy
on TV broke in.

20:23.602 --> 20:25.035
Cori!
Cori, over here.

20:25.104 --> 20:27.231
Take a look at this!

20:27.306 --> 20:29.467
Um, wait here.

20:29.542 --> 20:30.531
I'll be right back.

22:18.517 --> 22:20.178
You shouldn't wander
off like that.

22:20.252 --> 22:22.743
You know, if anybody
asked about--

22:29.228 --> 22:31.458
You know this means
as much to me as it does to you.

22:31.530 --> 22:33.760
But they're telling me the operation
is costing too--

22:33.832 --> 22:35.663
- Come on.
- If we don't hit pay dirt soon,

22:35.734 --> 22:37.565
- they're gonna shut us down.
- "Pay dirt"?

22:37.636 --> 22:40.400
I'm tired of them treating this
expedition
like an oil well.

22:40.472 --> 22:42.804
I know, I know, but they're
management.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.070
Arlen, you and I
had an agreement.

22:45.144 --> 22:48.170
I find you your "pay dirt,"
but I run the show my way.

22:48.247 --> 22:49.839
Hey, that's what I want.

22:49.915 --> 22:52.577
And I'm gonna keep them off
as long as I can.

22:52.651 --> 22:55.245
- Just do a good job, okay?
- I can't make miracles.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.153
Yes, you can.
That's why you're here.

22:58.223 --> 22:59.952
Dad?

23:00.025 --> 23:02.994
Dad, I'd like you to meet Sean Barker
from State.

23:03.062 --> 23:06.225
He was supposed to come up earlier,
but he had to finish up a project.

23:06.298 --> 23:09.426
Sean, my father,
Marcus Edwards.

23:09.501 --> 23:10.866
- Good to meet you son.
- Sir.

23:10.936 --> 23:12.528
We can use the help.

23:12.604 --> 23:15.505
Uh, this is Arlen Crane,
our Operations Director,

23:15.574 --> 23:18.042
And Gus Volker,
our Security Chief.

23:18.110 --> 23:19.737
Welcome aboard.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.042
Nice to meet you.

23:22.114 --> 23:24.514
Soon, Marcus, okay?

23:28.821 --> 23:30.618
Administration.

23:30.689 --> 23:33.658
Well, you go
get him set up.

23:33.726 --> 23:35.626
I've gotta go
crack the whip.

23:35.694 --> 23:36.752
Okay.
Thanks, dad.

23:40.165 --> 23:41.655
Come on.

23:41.734 --> 23:45.067
- I don't get it.
- This is where you want to be, right?

23:45.137 --> 23:47.128
- Yeah, but--
- So be happy.

24:08.026 --> 24:09.550
- Hey, Bob!
- Yeah?

24:09.628 --> 24:11.391
- Come down here for a minute.
- Sure.

24:11.463 --> 24:13.693
Okay, but we're playing
with my cards.

24:18.103 --> 24:19.832
Bob, this is Sean.
Sean, Bob.

24:19.905 --> 24:23.238
Show him the ropes, will ya?
I'll be back soon.

24:23.308 --> 24:25.208
Sure.
Come on.

24:39.358 --> 24:40.723
Lisker.

24:48.367 --> 24:50.699
So, what exactly
are we digging up here?

24:50.769 --> 24:54.034
Well, we think it's some variety
of pachycephalosaur.

24:54.106 --> 24:55.971
Although it's kinda small
for that family.

24:56.041 --> 24:59.533
See, once we carbon date it, then we'll
get
a real good idea what era it's from.

24:59.611 --> 25:02.876
It's funny, once I was
on this dig in Arizona...

25:13.492 --> 25:15.756
Wow, looks like
you really immersed yourself.

25:17.062 --> 25:18.927
Yeah.

25:18.997 --> 25:22.694
It's like I was digging up
parts of myself.

25:22.768 --> 25:25.896
You're not some kind
of archeology groupie, are you, Sean?

25:30.909 --> 25:34.811
Just that I...
can't figure you out.

25:34.880 --> 25:38.441
I mean, why is coming here
so important to you?

25:38.517 --> 25:40.178
Where did you see
those drawings?

25:42.621 --> 25:44.145
I told you.

25:44.223 --> 25:47.920
Oh yeah, right.

25:47.993 --> 25:50.393
Sean, I brought you here
like you asked.

25:50.462 --> 25:53.158
Don't you think I deserve
a real explanation?

25:54.199 --> 25:55.757
A hint even?

25:59.705 --> 26:01.002
Cori...

26:03.075 --> 26:04.940
I want to...

26:05.010 --> 26:06.807
but I can't.

26:06.879 --> 26:09.677
I-- I don't really know
what I'm looking for.

26:09.748 --> 26:12.717
I know, I know,
that's no answer.

26:12.784 --> 26:15.344
Yeah, your specialty,
I'm beginning to discover.

26:18.023 --> 26:20.514
Well, listen, maybe we should just
call today a field trip

26:20.592 --> 26:22.457
and tomorrow we'll
send you on your way.

26:22.527 --> 26:25.155
No! I need to stay.

26:26.832 --> 26:30.131
Look, I know I've got
no reason to be here.

26:30.202 --> 26:33.137
You don't even know me.
But I need to stay.

26:33.205 --> 26:34.695
Why?

26:36.408 --> 26:38.899
Because I can't
be anywhere else.

26:41.914 --> 26:43.939
I've got nowhere else to go.

26:44.016 --> 26:47.179
I'm sorry.
That's just not good enough.

26:53.959 --> 26:57.690
I thought you said you knew
what it was like to need to know.

26:57.763 --> 26:59.321
I wonder.

26:59.398 --> 27:02.060
Damn it.
Wait!

27:12.210 --> 27:14.440
It was around here
that we saw him somewhere.

27:17.015 --> 27:20.143
You think maybe we could do this
when there's a little more light?

27:20.218 --> 27:23.278
You want this werewolf or not?

27:23.355 --> 27:26.119
Look, you got about another
half hour, Mr. Kerlew.

27:26.191 --> 27:28.318
After that,
I'm calling it quits.

27:31.663 --> 27:34.188
Just hang on
to your checkbook.

27:36.601 --> 27:38.694
Oh, Jesus Christ.

27:44.343 --> 27:45.477
You think you're
the only one?

27:45.477 --> 27:46.034
You think you're
the only one?

27:46.111 --> 27:48.579
My dad and I are known
among the academic community

27:48.647 --> 27:51.081
as "outlaws of science."

27:51.149 --> 27:54.277
We're thinking
about getting jackets made up.

27:54.353 --> 27:56.913
Outlaws? Why?

27:56.989 --> 28:00.516
Oh, because of our
unconventional theories.

28:00.592 --> 28:02.355
We take on
the wild stuff.

28:02.427 --> 28:05.089
You know, the stuff that people laugh at
in the tabloids--

28:05.163 --> 28:06.858
Bigfoot,
crop circles.

28:08.633 --> 28:10.760
And the cave
paintings?

28:10.836 --> 28:13.031
You have a theory
on them?

28:14.940 --> 28:17.670
You know, I want
to tell you...

28:17.743 --> 28:18.971
but I can't.

28:21.113 --> 28:23.308
TouchÃ©.

28:23.382 --> 28:24.781
What was that?

28:24.850 --> 28:26.681
I don't know.
I heard someone shouting.

28:26.752 --> 28:29.277
- Oh no, it could be another bear
attack.
- Shit.

28:29.354 --> 28:31.379
You go and get help,
I'll take care of the bear.

28:31.456 --> 28:32.548
Right.

28:35.994 --> 28:38.087
He'll take care
of the bear?

28:38.163 --> 28:39.425
Oh shit!

28:51.143 --> 28:53.008
Take a picture!
Take a picture!

28:53.078 --> 28:56.741
Screw the picture,
you brain-dead hayseed! Shoot it!

28:56.815 --> 28:58.282
What about my money?

28:58.350 --> 29:00.215
- What about my money?
- Shoot it!

29:01.686 --> 29:03.916
Shoot it!

29:09.961 --> 29:13.124
- Hey! Help! Professor Atkins, help!
- Cori, what's wrong?!

29:13.198 --> 29:15.689
I think there's another bear attack.
Somebody's in trouble.

29:15.767 --> 29:18.736
- I'll get my gun. You go get the truck.
- Get the truck, right.

29:18.804 --> 29:21.295
- Hurry, Sean's out there.
- What?

29:24.676 --> 29:26.007
Guyver.

29:35.620 --> 29:37.485
Don't you come near me,
you son of a bitch.

29:48.667 --> 29:51.363
You shouldn't have come back.

29:54.139 --> 29:55.606
It can't be.

30:02.414 --> 30:03.676
Guyver?

30:03.748 --> 30:06.945
Get away from him,
zoanoid.

30:09.354 --> 30:12.050
Where did you come from?
I destroyed all of you.

31:40.946 --> 31:42.709
What are you doing
in the camp?

32:29.060 --> 32:30.960
Damn.

32:46.278 --> 32:47.745
Over here.
This way.

32:47.812 --> 32:50.212
- What happened? Where's the bear?
- I don't know.

32:50.282 --> 32:53.581
I think the sound of your engine
drove it off.

32:53.652 --> 32:55.847
- Oh my--
- Not soon enough.

33:00.191 --> 33:02.125
Look,
that one's alive.

33:02.193 --> 33:04.127
Oh! Whoa, man,
stay away from me.

33:04.195 --> 33:06.425
Don't touch me.
You're one of them.

33:06.498 --> 33:10.229
Shit. Look at him,
he's scared crazy.

33:11.803 --> 33:14.237
Take it easy,
we're here to help you.

33:14.306 --> 33:15.330
Are you all right?

33:17.442 --> 33:20.275
- He's in shock. Get me a blanket.
- Yeah, right.

33:20.345 --> 33:21.903
Make that two.

33:28.119 --> 33:29.984
I'm just sorry
I didn't get here sooner.

33:30.055 --> 33:32.046
Thank God you didn't.
You could've been killed.

33:32.123 --> 33:33.613
What'd you think you
were going to do?

33:33.692 --> 33:36.684
I was wondering that myself.

33:39.497 --> 33:41.260
All right, let's get him
in the truck.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.767
I got you. I got you.

33:43.835 --> 33:46.702
You two, wrap that one up
and put him in the back.

33:46.771 --> 33:48.238
I'll keep us covered.

34:06.925 --> 34:07.983
Okay, let's move out.

34:26.478 --> 34:28.969
I've never seen
one this big before.

34:30.382 --> 34:32.350
Who are you?

35:03.248 --> 35:05.113
When did he appear?

35:05.183 --> 35:07.981
He was on the scene
before anybody else.

35:08.052 --> 35:10.577
Barker, Sean Barker.

35:14.392 --> 35:17.020
Not at this time, but analysis
of the samples should--

35:21.766 --> 35:22.755
I have to go.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.330
What'd you hear?

35:32.877 --> 35:34.606
What?
Nothing.

35:34.679 --> 35:38.740
- I didn't hear anything.
- Then why'd you follow me?

35:38.817 --> 35:39.841
I-- I--

35:39.918 --> 35:42.785
Let me guess...

35:42.854 --> 35:44.549
Just curious, right?

35:44.622 --> 35:46.180
I saw you leave camp
in a hurry.

35:46.257 --> 35:48.487
I just figured you'd
seen the bear again.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.154
Now, you and I both know
there wasn't any bear.

35:51.229 --> 35:55.097
- We do?
- Spare me the dumb act.

35:55.166 --> 35:57.157
I know you got claws
you ain't showing.

35:57.235 --> 35:59.465
Claws?

35:59.537 --> 36:02.199
I'm not the one
with the claws.

36:02.273 --> 36:04.571
I don't know what
you people are up to,

36:04.642 --> 36:06.701
but innocent people
are getting killed

36:06.778 --> 36:08.609
and I can't allow
that to happen.

36:11.182 --> 36:13.616
Wait, you're
with the government.

36:16.254 --> 36:18.449
And you won't live long enough
to give me away.

36:21.593 --> 36:23.561
What do you think
you were doing?

36:23.628 --> 36:26.791
- Sorry, Mr. Crane.
- Tell the others we may have an
active--

36:29.601 --> 36:31.228
What are you men
doing there?

36:36.107 --> 36:40.407
Uh, we thought we saw
the bear again, Mr. Crane.

36:40.478 --> 36:42.571
Well, for God's sakes then,
stay in camp.

36:42.647 --> 36:44.672
We don't want anymore
corpses on our hands.

36:44.749 --> 36:46.979
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

36:58.296 --> 36:59.763
I gotta go.

36:59.831 --> 37:00.991
Wait!

37:01.065 --> 37:02.623
Who are you?

37:02.700 --> 37:04.327
What are you doing here?

37:10.842 --> 37:13.333
We don't need
this kind of attention.

37:13.411 --> 37:16.744
If you can't keep a tighter rein
on your lieutenants--

37:16.814 --> 37:18.941
I'm sorry, sir,
I'll correct my error.

37:19.017 --> 37:20.917
But it did bring
something to light.

37:20.985 --> 37:22.748
The Guyver.
He's here.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.481
He must be someone
in the camp.

37:24.556 --> 37:26.615
Hmm...

37:26.691 --> 37:29.489
The hunted comes
to the hunter.

37:29.561 --> 37:33.554
Find out who he is
and bring him here, quietly.

37:33.631 --> 37:35.758
Don't worry, sir,
I can handle it.

39:37.321 --> 39:39.084
- Morning, Bob.
- Yeah, good morning.

39:51.469 --> 39:54.029
This wasn't here
yesterday.

39:55.606 --> 39:56.903
Huh.

40:02.313 --> 40:05.578
Cori, you can tell me.
You like him?

40:05.650 --> 40:09.518
- None of your business.
- I'm just excited for you, that's all.

40:09.587 --> 40:13.421
I mean, it'd be nice to know
someone's finding a little romance.

40:13.491 --> 40:17.359
All right. He's cute,
but nothing is happening.

40:17.428 --> 40:19.919
- He's a little...
- Hi. Coffee?

40:27.004 --> 40:28.028
Did I miss something?

40:30.041 --> 40:32.509
Uh, no, Sean,
have a seat.

40:32.577 --> 40:34.101
That'll be all.

40:34.178 --> 40:35.440
Check on you in a bit.

40:37.115 --> 40:38.514
Take your time.

40:40.551 --> 40:43.850
So, how goes the quest?

40:43.921 --> 40:45.980
Well, I was
just wondering...

40:46.057 --> 40:49.117
what kind of skeletons
are we digging up again?

40:49.193 --> 40:51.252
Well, um,
we're not sure,

40:51.329 --> 40:53.490
but we think it's a kind
of pachycephalosaur,

40:53.564 --> 40:55.828
Although it's a little small
for that genus.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.026
Once we carbon date it,

40:57.101 --> 40:59.535
we'll know where
to place it, but right--

41:01.539 --> 41:02.665
What?

41:06.310 --> 41:09.245
You know, that's almost
word for word what Bob said.

41:11.415 --> 41:12.814
What are you guys hiding?

41:17.355 --> 41:19.880
They're not dinosaurs
at all, are they?

41:25.129 --> 41:28.621
Look, everybody here knows
what we're digging for.

41:28.699 --> 41:30.064
So why all the secrecy?

41:30.134 --> 41:32.625
We can't just go spouting
crazy theories to the world

41:32.703 --> 41:34.864
until we have the hard evidence
to back it up.

41:34.939 --> 41:38.841
Dad and I have been putting this puzzle
together for five years.

41:38.910 --> 41:42.903
I'm just praying it isn't another
"explainable mystery."

41:42.980 --> 41:44.413
If we're wrong again...

41:44.482 --> 41:47.110
So why don't you
stick to the safer stuff?

41:49.287 --> 41:51.084
Why don't you go home?

41:53.191 --> 41:56.592
I am not gonna let anybody
take this away from us.

42:10.942 --> 42:12.273
Well?

42:13.978 --> 42:17.744
It feels like leather.

42:17.815 --> 42:18.975
It's soft.

42:20.318 --> 42:21.512
Here, give me that.

42:26.390 --> 42:28.551
That don't sound
like leather to me.

42:29.794 --> 42:33.161
Hey, Dr. Edwards!
Dr. Edwards, over here.

42:36.767 --> 42:38.667
What have you got,
my dear?

42:38.736 --> 42:40.135
Listen.

42:46.077 --> 42:48.272
This is wonderful.

42:49.881 --> 42:51.678
Call my daughter,
inform Mr. Crane,

42:51.749 --> 42:53.876
Get everyone in here
on the double.

42:55.586 --> 42:57.679
I think we found it.

43:03.961 --> 43:05.792
Dad, what's going on?

43:05.863 --> 43:07.125
Corinne,

43:07.198 --> 43:10.827
I think our five years of research
are about to pay off.

43:17.341 --> 43:18.831
But when will we
know for sure?

43:18.910 --> 43:20.878
Patience, Arlen.
We beat your deadline,

43:20.945 --> 43:22.606
just give us the time
to do this right.

43:22.680 --> 43:25.114
But there's been a complication.
Something's come up.

43:25.182 --> 43:27.480
Arlen, please.

43:27.551 --> 43:29.712
Gee, you don't suppose
this is one of those

43:29.787 --> 43:31.152
"explainable mysteries,"
do you?

43:31.222 --> 43:32.951
Just shut up
and dig.

43:35.593 --> 43:37.527
Dr. Edwards, Dr. Edwards!

43:37.595 --> 43:39.324
We took some readings
up the cliff.

43:39.397 --> 43:42.833
It goes all the way to the top.
This thing is huge.

44:28.245 --> 44:30.975
If these cave paintings
are accurate representations,

44:31.048 --> 44:34.506
Then I speculate that it sinks down
another 40 meters

44:34.585 --> 44:36.883
and curves east and west
for 20 meters

44:36.954 --> 44:38.615
In each direction.

44:45.062 --> 44:46.620
It's a ship.

46:29.890 --> 46:32.825
- Bob, have you seen Sean?
- Not lately.

46:45.472 --> 46:47.599
Hey, you okay?

46:50.511 --> 46:52.809
I still can't believe it.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.939
I know what you mean.

46:56.517 --> 46:58.985
We came here
hoping to find anything--

46:59.053 --> 47:03.752
anything that would suggest
an ancient alien visitation.

47:03.824 --> 47:06.088
I mean, we would've
settled for alien beer cans.

47:07.695 --> 47:10.789
Instead we got...

47:13.567 --> 47:16.195
Five years
of getting laughed at,

47:16.270 --> 47:18.738
our research ignored
by our colleagues.

47:20.407 --> 47:23.137
Oh, the paper
I'm going to publish.

47:24.311 --> 47:26.779
But the best part
is that now I have got

47:26.847 --> 47:29.315
the greatest playground
a girl could ever wish for.

47:31.018 --> 47:33.213
Look at this.

47:33.287 --> 47:35.983
It's organic.
It was grown.

47:36.056 --> 47:39.423
That sample I took is alive.
Alive, Sean.

47:39.493 --> 47:41.791
This thing might've been
powered by photosynthesis.

47:41.862 --> 47:43.329
Okay, that's all theory,

47:43.397 --> 47:45.763
But with the funding from our sponsors,
we can find out.

47:45.833 --> 47:48.461
We might even be able
to duplicate it.

47:49.570 --> 47:52.130
Imagine being able
to grow a machine.

47:52.206 --> 47:55.403
No more dirty factories.
No more pollution.

47:55.476 --> 47:56.534
What?

47:56.610 --> 47:58.441
Nothing.

48:01.248 --> 48:03.113
Now I see why
they call you an outlaw.

48:03.183 --> 48:05.083
You haven't even
stepped inside

48:05.152 --> 48:06.847
and already you're
saving the world.

48:06.920 --> 48:10.151
What can I say?
I'm an optimist.

48:12.559 --> 48:15.255
I wish I could see
the world like that.

48:21.769 --> 48:25.296
We, um--
we're missing the party.

48:27.641 --> 48:30.166
I'm not missing
anything.

48:33.046 --> 48:36.174
Come on, let's go.

48:44.992 --> 48:48.519
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

48:53.167 --> 48:55.135
Nothing.

49:03.343 --> 49:06.744
You wanna see something
really scary?

49:28.635 --> 49:30.626
Hey, Cori, come here.

49:30.704 --> 49:32.103
I'll be just a second.

49:39.079 --> 49:40.740
Hey, what are you doing?

49:40.814 --> 49:43.009
What do you know about
the Chronos Corporation?

49:43.083 --> 49:45.381
- I don't know what you're talking
about.
- Come on.

49:45.452 --> 49:48.046
You dated a Mizky Segawa
whose father worked for Chronos.

49:48.121 --> 49:51.249
He was murdered shortly
before the LA branch was destroyed.

49:51.325 --> 49:53.259
Do you know anything
about that?

49:53.327 --> 49:55.454
Only what I read
in the papers.

49:55.529 --> 49:58.498
Hey, less of that shit,
all right?

49:58.565 --> 50:01.363
Let go of me.
I don't know anything.

50:01.435 --> 50:04.404
You knew enough
to know the claws weren't yours.

50:07.641 --> 50:10.838
- What?
- You said the claws weren't yours.

50:10.911 --> 50:13.038
So whose are they?

50:15.749 --> 50:17.307
That's what I thought.

50:17.384 --> 50:20.217
Now, I want to know what you know
about Chronos and what they do.

50:24.491 --> 50:27.460
Why? You said
Chronos was destroyed.

50:27.528 --> 50:29.792
Chronos LA.

50:31.098 --> 50:33.293
Chronos LA?

50:34.935 --> 50:37.199
Jesus.

50:37.271 --> 50:39.102
We know Chronos
is worldwide,

50:39.172 --> 50:40.935
but we don't know
what those things are.

50:41.008 --> 50:43.272
We found breeding tubes
and blood samples,

50:43.343 --> 50:45.641
but never any bodies.

50:48.715 --> 50:50.342
All right, look...

50:51.985 --> 50:53.680
Chronos is
those things--

50:53.754 --> 50:55.688
the whole organization.

50:55.756 --> 50:58.486
They look human,
but they're not.

50:59.593 --> 51:00.753
They change.

51:00.827 --> 51:02.385
You're serious,
aren't you?

51:02.462 --> 51:03.986
You saw that dead guy
last night.

51:04.064 --> 51:06.999
The thing that killed him
is one of the guys in this camp.

51:07.067 --> 51:09.433
- You saw this?
- Yeah.

51:09.503 --> 51:10.834
Then why didn't it
kill you?

51:10.904 --> 51:13.065
I...

51:17.811 --> 51:20.644
- I'll tell you later.
- No, you tell me now.

51:20.714 --> 51:22.341
Don't make me
have to arrest you.

51:24.685 --> 51:26.949
Here?

51:29.456 --> 51:30.980
Everything okay?

51:31.058 --> 51:34.050
Oh, yeah it's fine.
Nice guy.

51:38.832 --> 51:41.460
Kid, you gotta get
your priorities straight.

52:54.274 --> 52:56.139
Well, I'm open
to suggestions.

52:56.209 --> 52:58.336
Damn it!
We've come this far.

52:58.412 --> 52:59.811
Now what?

52:59.880 --> 53:02.906
We can have a laser cutter
up here in two days.

53:02.983 --> 53:05.213
- Three days tops.
- Three days?

53:05.285 --> 53:07.253
Don't we have anything else
in the camp?

53:07.320 --> 53:10.050
Sure, garden tools
and whisk brooms.

53:10.123 --> 53:12.648
Lasers weren't the first thing
on the equipment list.

53:12.726 --> 53:15.320
But we don't have time.

53:15.395 --> 53:19.559
Well, what do you want me to say,
"open sesame"?

54:06.780 --> 54:08.748
Amazing.

54:43.049 --> 54:45.950
It's breathable, and the radiation
levels
are acceptable.

54:46.019 --> 54:49.750
We can continue.
The rest of you may resume your work.

54:50.791 --> 54:54.659
- Cori, it's beautiful.
- Oh.

55:21.087 --> 55:24.545
No one is to touch anything
or enter any sealed room.

55:24.624 --> 55:26.922
We're cataloging only today.

55:26.993 --> 55:30.724
Take lots of pictures and try to map
the interior as you go.

55:30.797 --> 55:34.164
If you have any trouble
breathing, get out.

55:34.234 --> 55:36.896
We're not going to sacrifice anyone
in the name of science.

55:36.970 --> 55:38.301
Got it?

55:39.472 --> 55:41.269
Good.

55:41.341 --> 55:44.504
Cori, you and Sean
go that way.

55:44.578 --> 55:45.567
We'll go through here.

55:45.645 --> 55:47.909
Let's go.

56:04.631 --> 56:07.327
This way.
You have to see this.

56:20.380 --> 56:21.642
Wow.

56:25.552 --> 56:27.281
It's beautiful.

56:28.722 --> 56:30.917
It's really humid
in here.

57:22.776 --> 57:24.971
Can you hear me?

57:26.846 --> 57:28.746
I'm here.

57:37.190 --> 57:39.522
Talk to me, please.

57:51.938 --> 57:53.565
Well?

58:05.986 --> 58:07.647
My God,

58:07.721 --> 58:10.952
how in the hell are we
going to get up there?

58:11.024 --> 58:13.185
No stairs,
no visible access up.

58:13.259 --> 58:17.821
I have a feeling that walking
was optional for these people.

58:17.897 --> 58:20.525
We'll have to jury-rig
something, I suppose.

58:25.605 --> 58:26.970
Get started.

58:27.040 --> 58:29.907
I'm sure what we're
looking for is up there.

59:04.811 --> 59:06.403
I'm here.

59:10.884 --> 59:12.476
Well, you called me here.

59:12.552 --> 59:14.713
Aren't you going
to say something?

59:17.791 --> 59:23.195
Please, I'm trying,
but I don't understand.

59:28.802 --> 59:30.531
Please.

59:37.777 --> 59:41.372
Why did you do this
to me?

59:41.448 --> 59:45.179
What the hell am I?
What am I supposed to do with it?

59:48.688 --> 59:50.815
You got the wrong guy.

59:53.359 --> 59:55.418
I'm not cut out
for this.

59:57.831 --> 59:59.958
I can't live
like this anymore.

01:00:00.033 --> 01:00:02.866
I'm not a killer.

01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:14.075
I just want to be normal again.

01:00:25.525 --> 01:00:27.459
I want my life back!

01:00:49.249 --> 01:00:52.480
Dad, look at this.

01:00:53.553 --> 01:00:54.542
It moved.

01:00:57.223 --> 01:01:00.351
Cori, I told you
not to touch anything.

01:01:00.426 --> 01:01:02.291
What have you found?

01:01:02.362 --> 01:01:03.852
Let me see that.

01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:14.467
No! Give it back!

01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:16.031
Cori.

01:01:27.887 --> 01:01:31.983
We're the researchers.
It's our job to examine the new
artifacts.

01:01:32.058 --> 01:01:35.084
- You don't have the right--
- As founders of this expedition,

01:01:35.161 --> 01:01:37.629
we have whatever
rights we choose.

01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:39.597
If you don't like it,
you can go back to State

01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:41.224
and teach freshman
archeology

01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:43.201
while we're making history.

01:01:46.973 --> 01:01:49.271
Dad, why don't you
stop him?

01:01:49.342 --> 01:01:51.640
This is the most important
discovery we've ever made

01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:53.838
and you're letting him
take it away from us.

01:01:53.913 --> 01:01:56.006
We'll get
our chance, Cori.

01:01:56.082 --> 01:01:59.677
Arlen is just taking it away
for safe keeping.

01:01:59.752 --> 01:02:03.210
Safe keeping?
He's stealing it.

01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:04.722
Cori, are you okay?

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:06.952
Sean, he's taking
it away.

01:02:18.838 --> 01:02:20.738
This is a breach
of contract, Crane.

01:02:20.807 --> 01:02:22.934
We'll sue you for this!

01:02:23.009 --> 01:02:25.170
We were supposed
to have free rein, damn it!

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:29.079
No interference from the corporation.
Do you hear me?

01:02:29.148 --> 01:02:31.844
- Forget it, Cori.
- Dad.

01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:33.943
We'll get
our chance, Cori.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.578
Just let it go.

01:02:35.655 --> 01:02:39.147
- Cori--
- No! What is the matter with you all?

01:02:39.225 --> 01:02:41.216
He took it away from us.

01:02:49.469 --> 01:02:51.164
Mr. Crane...

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.933
it's about the new kid.

01:02:58.177 --> 01:02:58.378
Can I come in?

01:02:58.378 --> 01:02:59.845
Can I come in?

01:03:01.014 --> 01:03:03.710
What do you want, Sean?

01:03:03.783 --> 01:03:06.616
I have to talk to you...
about Crane.

01:03:08.021 --> 01:03:11.286
I don't want to talk about him
right now, okay?

01:03:11.357 --> 01:03:14.554
Cori, there are things
you need to know.

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:27.368
I don't know how
to tell you this,

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.309
but you and your father
have been lied to.

01:03:35.114 --> 01:03:37.810
You're working for a corporation
called Chronos,

01:03:37.884 --> 01:03:40.648
and Crane
is a part of them.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.018
They--

01:03:43.089 --> 01:03:45.785
They're not good people.

01:03:45.858 --> 01:03:48.122
Where did you get all this?

01:03:48.194 --> 01:03:51.027
I don't know any Chronos.

01:03:51.097 --> 01:03:52.826
Our backers are
the Tempus Group.

01:03:52.899 --> 01:03:56.096
No, they're Chronos.
Trust me.

01:03:56.169 --> 01:03:59.605
The thing you discovered
is very important to them.

01:03:59.672 --> 01:04:02.163
It's called
the Guyver unit.

01:04:02.241 --> 01:04:04.869
It's--
it's a powerful weapon.

01:04:04.944 --> 01:04:07.538
Chronos has been
after it for years.

01:04:07.613 --> 01:04:11.049
All the people--

01:04:11.117 --> 01:04:12.550
Shit.

01:04:12.618 --> 01:04:15.951
All the people

01:04:16.022 --> 01:04:18.547
who work for Chronos

01:04:18.624 --> 01:04:21.650
can change

01:04:21.728 --> 01:04:24.856
into monsters
called Zoanoids.

01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:27.559
Volker is one for sure,
probably most of the others.

01:04:27.633 --> 01:04:30.033
The monsters
in the cave paintings

01:04:30.103 --> 01:04:33.368
and the skeletons you've been
digging up, they're Zoanoids.

01:04:33.439 --> 01:04:35.373
The-- the bears
that killed those people

01:04:35.441 --> 01:04:36.408
are Zoanoids too.

01:04:36.476 --> 01:04:39.411
They've lived alongside
us forever.

01:04:39.479 --> 01:04:42.812
All the stories you've ever heard about
werewolves or Bigfoot,

01:04:42.882 --> 01:04:44.907
they're all--

01:04:44.984 --> 01:04:47.509
Cori, I know,
but it's the truth.

01:04:47.587 --> 01:04:49.953
- Listen.
- No, you listen--

01:04:50.022 --> 01:04:51.614
I don't care who they are.

01:04:51.691 --> 01:04:54.182
They put up the money
for this dig when no one else would.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.785
If they pull out,
the ship is gone.

01:04:56.863 --> 01:04:59.889
Oh, shit.
We've only just stepped inside.

01:04:59.966 --> 01:05:03.231
But is the ship more important
than your life?

01:05:03.302 --> 01:05:05.736
You're dealing
with monsters here.

01:05:07.707 --> 01:05:10.870
I trusted you, Sean.

01:05:10.943 --> 01:05:12.843
I trusted you
not to be crazy.

01:05:17.817 --> 01:05:18.784
Damn it!

01:05:20.019 --> 01:05:21.418
Crane--

01:05:29.629 --> 01:05:32.894
The ship we excavated
is a gold mine, Mr. Gouo.

01:05:32.965 --> 01:05:35.900
Now it's time to terminate
all non-Chronos personnel

01:05:35.968 --> 01:05:38.027
and bring in our own.

01:05:38.104 --> 01:05:39.901
Terminate?

01:05:39.972 --> 01:05:42.532
What about Edwards' daughter
and the Guyver?

01:05:42.608 --> 01:05:45.133
Don't worry about her,
she's handled.

01:05:45.211 --> 01:05:46.974
And the Guyver
is in our hands.

01:05:47.046 --> 01:05:48.911
It will be on the way
to you in an hour.

01:05:48.981 --> 01:05:52.781
No promises, Crane,
just results.

01:05:57.657 --> 01:06:00.251
Mr. Crane--

01:06:01.427 --> 01:06:03.827
I think we got a problem.

01:06:05.898 --> 01:06:09.026
Hey, Bob,
have you seen Cori?

01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:11.695
You guys just can't seem
to connect, can you?

01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:12.795
Tell me about it.

01:06:12.872 --> 01:06:15.306
Try the commissary,
it's lunch time.

01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:17.467
Right, thanks.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.642
Excuse me.

01:07:33.052 --> 01:07:35.043
It's calling you,
isn't it?

01:07:37.623 --> 01:07:39.488
What do you mean?

01:07:40.793 --> 01:07:42.988
It calls me too.

01:07:45.264 --> 01:07:47.255
We're both its children.

01:07:50.303 --> 01:07:52.533
Sean, I know who you are.

01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:55.272
I know your pain.

01:07:55.341 --> 01:07:57.332
I'm like you.

01:07:58.678 --> 01:08:00.475
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:08:00.546 --> 01:08:04.004
We're the bastards

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:05.516
of an uncaring parent.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.919
We've been violated,

01:08:08.988 --> 01:08:11.980
our lives have been
changed against our will.

01:08:15.828 --> 01:08:19.423
Sean, I know what
it's been like for you...

01:08:19.497 --> 01:08:22.399
for me.

01:08:22.468 --> 01:08:24.629
You've lost friends
and lovers, haven't you?

01:08:28.441 --> 01:08:29.965
So have I.

01:08:32.243 --> 01:08:35.372
We're forced
to lead secret lives.

01:08:40.353 --> 01:08:41.944
Trust me.

01:09:05.511 --> 01:09:07.444
I know,

01:09:07.513 --> 01:09:10.140
Look at me, I'm hideous.

01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:11.944
Do you think I want
to be this way?

01:09:12.018 --> 01:09:13.747
A freak?

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:17.585
That's why we're here--
to take back our lives.

01:09:17.657 --> 01:09:19.750
Somewhere in this ship

01:09:19.825 --> 01:09:22.191
Is the key to changing
us back.

01:09:22.261 --> 01:09:24.821
Let's find it together.

01:09:24.897 --> 01:09:27.161
We can take the Guyver
out of you.

01:09:27.233 --> 01:09:30.828
We can make you
normal again.

01:09:30.903 --> 01:09:33.064
Isn't that what you want?

01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:38.638
I don't know.

01:09:40.513 --> 01:09:43.310
- You're killers.
- And so are you.

01:09:43.381 --> 01:09:46.613
No, it's the one
that kills, not me.

01:09:46.685 --> 01:09:51.589
Then let us help you.
We can make it stop.

01:09:54.225 --> 01:09:57.286
What do you say?
Friends?

01:10:04.937 --> 01:10:06.336
I...

01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:12.778
No.

01:10:16.248 --> 01:10:17.806
Pity.

01:10:20.653 --> 01:10:23.679
Keep him sedated
until we return to base.

01:10:38.604 --> 01:10:40.367
I love my job.

01:10:49.882 --> 01:10:51.144
Comfy?

01:10:53.986 --> 01:10:55.146
Hey, bitch!

01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:59.885
- What did we hit?
- I don't know.

01:10:59.959 --> 01:11:01.324
Well, step on it!

01:11:14.373 --> 01:11:15.635
Oh my God!

01:11:16.909 --> 01:11:18.706
You, girl, get out.

01:11:23.549 --> 01:11:26.177
- Shit.
- Run!

01:12:35.721 --> 01:12:38.747
You shouldn't have
interfered, Marcus.

01:12:41.794 --> 01:12:43.455
Dad?

01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:27.790
Dad! Dad!

01:14:49.588 --> 01:14:52.455
Don't hurt him.
Leave him alone!

01:15:20.519 --> 01:15:22.783
Sleep tight, baby.

01:15:27.092 --> 01:15:30.391
- Keep an eye on him.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:46.339
Barker, Barker.

01:15:46.412 --> 01:15:47.902
- Atkins?
- You okay, kid?

01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:51.006
- What-- yeah.
- Listen, I gotta get you outta here.

01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:54.382
- The government wants you in one piece.
- What?

01:15:54.453 --> 01:15:55.715
My backup is on its way.

01:15:55.788 --> 01:15:57.813
This place is about
to become a battlefield.

01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:00.256
- Battlefield? Jesus. But the students--
- Shh.

01:16:00.325 --> 01:16:01.383
The students are fine.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.394
Now listen,
about this Guyver unit,

01:16:03.462 --> 01:16:05.430
what can it do?
Do they know how to use it?

01:16:05.497 --> 01:16:07.362
Cori, shit, I've got to get her
out of here.

01:16:07.433 --> 01:16:09.298
No, it's too late.
They've already taken her.

01:16:09.368 --> 01:16:11.393
- There was nothing I could do.
- Where? When?

01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:14.030
About this Guyver unit--
they took the south road 15 minutes ago.

01:16:14.106 --> 01:16:16.233
Now look, what about this Guyver unit?
How does it work?

01:16:16.308 --> 01:16:18.572
- I've got to go.
- You're not going anywhere. We need
you.

01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:22.774
- But she's in danger.
- I'm sorry, I can't let you go.

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:27.851
Now look, this--

01:16:31.623 --> 01:16:32.851
Aw, shit.

01:16:48.006 --> 01:16:49.473
Shit.

01:18:06.351 --> 01:18:08.683
Co-ri!

01:18:13.892 --> 01:18:17.919
Cori!

01:18:19.464 --> 01:18:21.398
Sean?

01:18:21.466 --> 01:18:23.366
Sean! Help!

01:18:23.435 --> 01:18:25.494
Help us!

01:18:32.244 --> 01:18:33.734
Shit.

01:19:08.614 --> 01:19:10.411
Guyver!

01:19:53.158 --> 01:19:54.125
Ohh!

01:20:20.686 --> 01:20:22.085
Take cover!

01:21:16.875 --> 01:21:19.207
Yaah!

01:23:11.523 --> 01:23:14.185
Hah!

01:24:04.743 --> 01:24:05.937
Cori.

01:24:09.247 --> 01:24:10.612
No!

01:24:37.309 --> 01:24:38.503
Sean?

01:24:47.118 --> 01:24:48.107
Wait!

01:25:08.473 --> 01:25:10.338
It's done, sir.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:14.139
But...

01:25:16.414 --> 01:25:18.314
the Guyver has escaped.

01:25:23.655 --> 01:25:25.020
He'll be back.

01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:35.527
Mr. Crane, help us.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.761
Mr. Crane,
what's going on?

01:25:37.836 --> 01:25:40.464
I'm sorry, your services
are no longer needed.

01:25:41.973 --> 01:25:43.941
Nothing personal.

01:25:44.009 --> 01:25:46.409
Wait!
You can't do this.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.748
Hey, what is this?

01:25:55.353 --> 01:25:58.220
Hey, man, be cool.

01:25:58.289 --> 01:25:59.916
You don't have
to do this.

01:25:59.991 --> 01:26:01.151
Oh my God!

01:26:09.834 --> 01:26:13.065
Don't do anything...
funny.

01:26:17.542 --> 01:26:19.567
Thanks for saving
my life.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.379
I wanted to tell you,

01:26:31.456 --> 01:26:33.185
but how could I?
How do you tell somebody--

01:26:33.258 --> 01:26:35.590
What you told me
was hard enough.

01:26:36.828 --> 01:26:39.695
It took a lot
of guts, Sean.

01:26:40.932 --> 01:26:42.456
Look...

01:26:43.601 --> 01:26:45.899
you don't have
to be nice to me, okay?

01:26:47.238 --> 01:26:49.706
You didn't know
what you were getting into.

01:26:51.843 --> 01:26:55.711
If you don't want to have
anything to do with me, I'll understand.

01:26:56.748 --> 01:26:59.114
It's not the first time.

01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:14.562
Hey, it's every
woman's dream

01:27:14.632 --> 01:27:17.226
to be rescued by
a knight in shining armor...

01:27:21.005 --> 01:27:24.236
Even if he wears it on the inside.

01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:48.831
Look, I left your truck
at the top of the hill.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.868
Drive back to town,
find a place to hole up.

01:27:50.935 --> 01:27:52.300
I'll meet you
as soon as I can.

01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:56.101
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- No, it's too dangerous.

01:27:56.174 --> 01:27:59.007
Atkins is bringing in a strike force
to arrest Crane and his men.

01:27:59.077 --> 01:28:00.772
Professor Atkins?

01:28:00.845 --> 01:28:02.813
Commander.
He's with the government.

01:28:02.881 --> 01:28:05.281
But he's gonna get slaughtered
if I don't get back there.

01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:08.444
I don't care.
I'm going with you.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.284
My father's back there.
I'm not leaving him.

01:28:13.158 --> 01:28:14.318
Okay, come on.

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:16.654
Move it, move it!

01:28:16.728 --> 01:28:19.492
Come on, people,
double time, let's go!

01:28:24.235 --> 01:28:25.532
Let's go!

01:28:56.267 --> 01:28:58.462
This is an outrage.
We're a reputable company.

01:28:58.536 --> 01:29:01.630
Reputable companies don't conduct
sick experiments on people.

01:29:01.706 --> 01:29:02.798
Where's your proof?

01:29:02.874 --> 01:29:04.865
A judge would laugh
this case out of court.

01:29:04.943 --> 01:29:06.501
Too bad it's not
going to court.

01:29:06.578 --> 01:29:08.205
Don't even try it,

01:29:08.279 --> 01:29:11.339
unless you think you're faster
than a speeding bullet.

01:29:16.521 --> 01:29:18.785
- Camp's secured, sir.
- Secure?

01:29:18.857 --> 01:29:21.052
- Where's the other one?
- Capped one in the cave.

01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:23.719
- This is the only other.
- No, there's one more.

01:29:25.029 --> 01:29:26.724
Where's Corben?

01:29:28.199 --> 01:29:31.259
This is becoming interesting,
isn't it, captain?

01:29:35.173 --> 01:29:38.336
Eagle 2, this is Eagle 1.
One hostile still at large.

01:29:38.409 --> 01:29:40.377
Code red status.
Shoot to kill.

01:29:40.445 --> 01:29:42.675
I repeat, shoot to kill.

01:29:42.747 --> 01:29:45.614
Read you, Lima Charlie,
Eagle 1.

01:29:50.288 --> 01:29:51.778
We'll find him
soon enough.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.665
Or he'll find you.

01:30:06.037 --> 01:30:08.164
Mason, Lewis,
intercept the enemy.

01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:09.297
Yes, sir!

01:30:11.276 --> 01:30:14.404
More lambs to the slaughter?

01:30:26.357 --> 01:30:28.348
- Looks like he did it.
- No.

01:30:28.426 --> 01:30:31.361
Something's wrong.
Where's his backup?

01:30:33.398 --> 01:30:35.263
Come on,
we don't have much time.

01:30:37.268 --> 01:30:38.394
Wait!

01:30:39.871 --> 01:30:41.634
Would you wait?

01:30:41.706 --> 01:30:43.173
What is it?

01:30:43.241 --> 01:30:45.038
We have to destroy
the ship.

01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:49.145
Destroy the ship?
Why?

01:30:49.213 --> 01:30:51.408
Atkins is out there,
everything's under control.

01:30:51.482 --> 01:30:53.006
I'm not so sure about that.

01:30:53.084 --> 01:30:54.949
Besides,
it doesn't matter who wins.

01:30:55.019 --> 01:30:57.715
I doubt the government
is any more responsible than Chronos.

01:30:57.789 --> 01:31:01.316
No, we can't.
All that knowledge.

01:31:01.392 --> 01:31:04.759
- I'll never get a chance to do the
research--
- Neither will I.

01:31:04.829 --> 01:31:06.660
But if we don't
destroy it,

01:31:06.731 --> 01:31:09.131
too many people will die
fighting for it.

01:31:21.112 --> 01:31:23.945
They want
the weapons, Cori.

01:31:24.015 --> 01:31:26.040
That's all
they'll ever want.

01:31:46.971 --> 01:31:48.905
You know, that's only
gonna piss him off.

01:32:00.918 --> 01:32:03.318
Now that we've wasted
enough time...

01:32:07.392 --> 01:32:09.223
I have to take this.

01:32:11.262 --> 01:32:13.628
Your hour is up.
Where is the Guyver?

01:32:13.698 --> 01:32:16.963
There's been some delays.
The Guyver--

01:32:17.035 --> 01:32:19.299
- Crane--
- We'll get him back sir.

01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:22.806
He's fixated on the ship.
He won't leave.

01:32:22.874 --> 01:32:25.604
Have him here
in an another hour.

01:32:25.676 --> 01:32:28.941
Or shall I send someone
with more experience?

01:32:29.013 --> 01:32:32.471
No. No, I can handle it.
I'll take care of it.

01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:34.347
One more hour, Crane.

01:32:35.653 --> 01:32:37.518
If we lose him...

01:32:37.588 --> 01:32:41.024
One hour, sir.
Yes, sir.

01:32:44.262 --> 01:32:45.320
Shit!

01:33:26.804 --> 01:33:30.831
What gets me is that I've spent
my whole life working toward this,

01:33:30.908 --> 01:33:34.071
always scared that I was chasing
some pipe dream.

01:33:36.681 --> 01:33:38.706
And the minute
I find out it's true...

01:33:42.753 --> 01:33:44.584
I have to destroy it.

01:33:56.868 --> 01:33:59.132
What's wrong?

01:34:08.779 --> 01:34:10.770
Don't fight it.

01:34:10.848 --> 01:34:12.406
Go.

01:34:31.135 --> 01:34:32.830
Keep setting the charges.

01:34:45.883 --> 01:34:48.374
Why do you keep calling me?

01:34:48.452 --> 01:34:49.885
Am I not the one
you want?

01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.805
I'm not the one, am I?

01:35:21.219 --> 01:35:22.243
Guyver.

01:38:11.055 --> 01:38:12.886
The Guyver
will be back soon.

01:38:12.957 --> 01:38:15.425
Let's prepare him
a nice welcome.

01:38:15.493 --> 01:38:16.755
What about him?

01:38:19.797 --> 01:38:24.029
Bring him. Let's show him
some real soldiers in action.

01:38:32.076 --> 01:38:35.705
Come on, Sean,
where are you?

01:38:42.386 --> 01:38:43.853
Take her!

01:38:56.066 --> 01:38:57.465
Sean!
Sean, help.

01:39:09.413 --> 01:39:11.847
An archeologist
destroying the past?

01:39:11.916 --> 01:39:16.114
Not accepted scientific behavior,
Miss Edwards.

01:39:16.187 --> 01:39:18.655
It's better than handing it
over to you.

01:39:21.525 --> 01:39:23.789
The Guyver must be in the ship.
Find him.

01:39:54.325 --> 01:39:55.758
Let her go, Crane.

01:39:56.894 --> 01:39:59.658
Impressive,
but pointless.

01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:03.222
- Are you okay, Cori?
- Yeah.

01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.131
Sean, don't be a hero.

01:40:05.202 --> 01:40:08.569
Deactivate the Guyver
and surrender

01:40:08.639 --> 01:40:10.800
or I'll kill her.

01:40:10.875 --> 01:40:13.400
Don't listen to him, Sean.

01:40:15.779 --> 01:40:17.474
Time's a' wastin'.

01:40:17.548 --> 01:40:19.379
Crane!

01:40:20.651 --> 01:40:21.675
Stop!

01:40:24.688 --> 01:40:28.715
- Crane, we had a deal.
- Dad, help.

01:40:28.792 --> 01:40:32.558
Arlen, please,
we had a deal.

01:40:32.630 --> 01:40:34.894
Yes, we pay
for your research

01:40:34.965 --> 01:40:36.899
and you give us
the weapons.

01:40:36.967 --> 01:40:38.992
You should've told
your daughter, Marcus.

01:40:39.069 --> 01:40:41.299
It would've saved us
a lot of trouble.

01:40:41.372 --> 01:40:44.205
Dad, how could you bargain
with this murderer?

01:40:44.275 --> 01:40:48.109
Don't you get it, Cori?
Your dad's a company man.

01:40:48.178 --> 01:40:50.908
Stand aside, Marcus!

01:40:53.083 --> 01:40:54.710
Now, one last time,

01:40:54.785 --> 01:40:57.219
retract the armor...

01:41:01.492 --> 01:41:03.084
or I'll tear her apart.

01:41:12.903 --> 01:41:15.895
No! You will not
hurt my daughter.

01:41:26.216 --> 01:41:27.376
Marcus!

01:41:30.287 --> 01:41:31.754
You're fired.

01:41:51.241 --> 01:41:52.367
Atkins, catch!

01:41:54.211 --> 01:41:56.076
Protect her.

01:41:58.515 --> 01:42:00.005
Who the hell's
gonna protect me?

01:42:08.192 --> 01:42:09.489
Give me the case.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.152
- The case.
- Yeah--

01:42:11.228 --> 01:42:13.458
Just give it to me!

01:42:13.530 --> 01:42:14.997
Okay, bitch,
come and get it.

01:42:24.575 --> 01:42:27.009
That's mine!

01:43:12.289 --> 01:43:13.449
Dad!

01:43:42.386 --> 01:43:43.580
Hey, hey.

01:45:58.522 --> 01:45:59.921
Bitch.

01:46:23.247 --> 01:46:24.271
Do it.

01:46:32.356 --> 01:46:34.483
It didn't have to be
this way, Marcus.

01:46:34.558 --> 01:46:36.822
We were doing great
things together.

01:46:36.894 --> 01:46:38.885
You could've been
somebody in the company.

01:46:38.962 --> 01:46:42.090
Junior vice president
in charge of genocide?

01:46:42.165 --> 01:46:43.530
I'd rather die.

01:46:49.439 --> 01:46:51.737
Then so be it!

01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:02.245
No!

01:47:39.122 --> 01:47:40.919
Leave him alone.

01:47:42.392 --> 01:47:43.484
Back off.

01:47:45.495 --> 01:47:46.621
How's he doing?

01:47:46.697 --> 01:47:49.791
I don't know.
It's bad.

01:47:51.435 --> 01:47:54.336
Why are you attacking
your own kind, freak?

01:47:54.404 --> 01:47:55.598
We could've helped you.

01:47:55.672 --> 01:47:58.163
I'm no freak
and I'm not like you.

01:47:58.241 --> 01:48:00.971
You threaten mankind.
I protect them.

01:48:02.546 --> 01:48:04.138
Barker!

01:48:18.295 --> 01:48:21.093
- You didn't.
- So tell me,

01:48:21.164 --> 01:48:23.564
who's going
to protect the protector?

01:48:24.634 --> 01:48:25.896
Bio-morph.

01:48:41.418 --> 01:48:43.352
Oh my God.

01:48:44.388 --> 01:48:47.653
A Guyver zoanoid.

01:48:47.724 --> 01:48:49.555
The next step.

01:48:49.626 --> 01:48:51.389
You don't know
what you're doing, Crane.

01:48:51.461 --> 01:48:53.554
That unit's damaged.

01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:55.689
You have no idea what
it'll do to you.

01:48:55.766 --> 01:48:58.234
But it'll do you
just fine.

01:50:18.582 --> 01:50:21.278
You can't win, Crane.
The ship told me the truth.

01:50:21.351 --> 01:50:23.319
You're an experiment
gone out of control.

01:50:23.386 --> 01:50:25.320
No, I'm
in complete control.

01:50:25.388 --> 01:50:28.323
The aliens created the Guyver
to fix their mistakes.

01:50:28.391 --> 01:50:30.916
You're the mistake.
I'm the final product.

01:52:41.524 --> 01:52:44.152
With this alien power,

01:52:44.227 --> 01:52:46.559
Chronos will be triumphant

01:52:46.630 --> 01:52:48.723
and man shall know
his true destiny--

01:52:48.798 --> 01:52:51.528
To serve our kind!

01:52:51.601 --> 01:52:53.899
Not if I can help it.
You're cracked, Crane.

01:52:53.970 --> 01:52:55.699
You're gonna self-destruct.

01:52:55.772 --> 01:52:58.138
Never.
The unit feeds me.

01:52:58.208 --> 01:53:01.109
I feel the power
growing stronger.

01:53:13.690 --> 01:53:16.352
How does it feel
to be obsolete,

01:53:16.426 --> 01:53:18.485
outclassed
by a new model?

01:53:18.561 --> 01:53:19.687
Crane!

01:53:39.883 --> 01:53:43.785
Sorry, Crane, this model
has been recalled.

01:54:05.608 --> 01:54:08.509
No!
No, help me!

01:55:18.715 --> 01:55:20.580
Out of control.

01:55:24.621 --> 01:55:25.918
Sean!

01:55:32.896 --> 01:55:34.625
Sean, we did it.

01:55:37.634 --> 01:55:38.692
We did it.

01:55:45.809 --> 01:55:49.336
So it looks like
you found your destiny.

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:52.170
Cori, I lied.

01:55:52.248 --> 01:55:54.478
The Zoanoids weren't
the failed experiment--

01:55:54.551 --> 01:55:56.382
the Guyvers were.

01:55:56.453 --> 01:55:58.284
The aliens turned
humans into Guyvers

01:55:58.354 --> 01:56:00.447
so we could fight
their wars for them.

01:56:00.523 --> 01:56:04.050
But humans rebelled--
out of control.

01:56:04.127 --> 01:56:06.721
Guyver is nothing
more than a weapon.

01:56:08.898 --> 01:56:10.832
I have no destiny.

01:56:14.671 --> 01:56:16.798
You made your own.

01:56:19.409 --> 01:56:21.468
You're a hell
of a weapon, kid.

01:56:21.544 --> 01:56:24.172
It's a good thing
you're on our side.

01:56:25.415 --> 01:56:27.383
I'm not a religious man...

01:56:28.618 --> 01:56:32.019
but you may have
just prevented Armageddon.

01:56:32.088 --> 01:56:34.249
Who knows how many
more weapons are on board?

01:56:36.125 --> 01:56:38.525
Well, now at least they'll
be safe with the government,

01:56:38.595 --> 01:56:41.689
- where they belong.
- No.

01:56:41.764 --> 01:56:43.891
That's not where
it belongs.

01:56:59.315 --> 01:57:00.407
What are you doing?

01:57:14.898 --> 01:57:17.423
- Sean?
- Stand back, Cori.

01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:19.400
What are you doing,
Goddamn it?

01:57:19.469 --> 01:57:21.266
I'm sending it home.

01:57:21.337 --> 01:57:23.271
What?
You can't do that.

01:57:23.339 --> 01:57:26.001
That's government property.
Stop it!

01:57:26.075 --> 01:57:28.236
You're jeopardizing
our national security.

01:57:28.311 --> 01:57:30.609
No, I'm saving it.

01:57:45.261 --> 01:57:47.388
It's not safe.
Let's go.

01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:49.212
Barker?

01:59:49.285 --> 01:59:51.651
- This is not the time.
- Barker, we have to talk.

01:59:51.721 --> 01:59:53.120
There's nothing
more to say.

01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:54.657
I already
told you everything.

01:59:54.857 --> 01:59:57.985
Wait! We're launching an underground war
against Chronos.

01:59:58.061 --> 02:00:00.825
The government
could use your help.

02:00:02.665 --> 02:00:04.633
See you around,
Atkins.

02:00:09.572 --> 02:00:11.870
At least tell me
how I can reach you!

02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:22.344
See you around, kid.
