WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:09.509
Brad, hold on, all right?

00:14.097 --> 00:16.391
Go to the back. Climb to--

00:16.474 --> 00:18.435
-At least 2000 feet. Got it.
-Yep.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.812
-Is there an emergency kit?
-Behind the seat.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.319
All right, we're level at 2000.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.740
We're coasting.
You can undo your seatbelt.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.657
Okay.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.160
-Brad.
-Yeah?

00:35.243 --> 00:37.704
-I'll give you some aspirin, okay?
-Yeah.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.748
This will help stop
the blood from clotting.

00:39.831 --> 00:40.665
Okay.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.421
Jack, you're gonna have to land us.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.678
Honey Harbor's
about three miles out.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.096
Unicom frequency.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.269
Give them my tail number.

01:01.352 --> 01:05.732
1703 Delta.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.275
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.818
Honey Harbor Unicom.

01:08.902 --> 01:13.073
This is floatplane November 1703 Delta.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.033
We're coming in for an emergency landing.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.619
I repeat, we're coming in
for an emergency landing.

01:17.702 --> 01:21.206
The pilot's having a heart attack.
Ambulance transport needed.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.416
<i>This is the Honey Harbor FBO,</i>
<i>request heard.</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:25.376
<i>-How many souls onboard?</i>
-Three.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.504
<i>-We have visual.</i>
-Put this under your tongue.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.006
It's nitroglycerin.
It'll help with your pain.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.300
-Okay.
-Try to take deep breaths, if you can.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.886
<i>November 1703 Delta,</i>

01:34.969 --> 01:37.806
<i>090 at six knots, no traffic.</i>

01:37.889 --> 01:40.683
<i>Approach from the west for Dock 7.</i>
<i>We're shining a light.</i>

01:40.767 --> 01:42.310
I'll need some help here.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.896
Pitch for 70 knots, flaps 30.

01:44.979 --> 01:45.855
Copy that.

01:47.357 --> 01:51.152
-How far from the surface?
-Uh, about 30 feet top to bottom.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.695
Okay, pull up, pull up.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.572
Tell me when.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.866
-Little more.
-Yeah.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.452
Brace for impact!

02:14.968 --> 02:16.970
Straight to the OR. Coming through.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.813
Hey.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.274
Sorry for the wait. We're a little busy.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.693
Maternal assessment
showed no irregularities.

02:31.776 --> 02:32.986
Good news all around.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.195
-Thank God.
-Thank you.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.490
-So when can I take her home?
-Already signed the discharge papers.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.034
-All right. Great. Yeah.
-Yeah. Thanks.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.162
What about Brad?

02:42.245 --> 02:45.123
-Stable and headed to the cath lab.
-Good.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.835
-Lucky you two were on that flight.
-Thank you, Dr. Keram.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.628
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.633
See? We're okay.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.594
Mm-hm. Yeah.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.470
How you feeling?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.140
I'm better.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.144
It's just, with that impact,
I thought maybe something--

03:06.227 --> 03:08.813
No, the doctor just said
everything's fine.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.233
I know, it's just,
what if something had happened?

03:12.317 --> 03:15.320
Hey, you were the one that said
no more what ifs, remember?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.240
You're right. It's just hard not to.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.493
I know, I know.
Let's focus on the positive.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.205
Let's get you home,
so you can get some rest.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.122
Okay.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.170
You know, we were supposed to be
sleeping under the stars tonight.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.713
Where?

03:33.796 --> 03:35.173
Whispering Rock.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.885
-You were--? You were taking me camping?
-Mm-hm.

03:39.761 --> 03:43.514
-I thought you hated sleeping outside.
-I do. That's how much I love you.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.100
Oh, God, I love you.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.278
Uh-huh. Okay. Thank you, Dr. Lorton.

03:59.530 --> 04:00.865
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.786
Uh, Dr. Keram sent her copies
of my test results and blood work.

04:04.869 --> 04:05.954
What'd she say?

04:06.037 --> 04:10.250
We scheduled the NT ultrasound
and the maternal serum test for Week 11.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.001
Did she find a problem?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.046
No. No, we're just being cautious.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.173
-Okay. Good.
-Yeah.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.884
-Let me know when, I'll go with you.
-Okay.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.137
She also said we could do the NIPT.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.975
Well, I think we can
take care of the other tests

04:27.058 --> 04:29.602
before we deal with the NIPT.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.021
Why?

04:32.605 --> 04:35.692
Because, I mean,
that result doesn't really matter.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.196
Mm. But once we know
the paternity, we can move on.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.324
We're past that. This baby's coming
whether we're ready or not.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.913
But don't you think our child
will wanna know their genealogy?

04:48.997 --> 04:52.375
It will be a while before
they can even say "genealogy,"

04:52.458 --> 04:54.085
let alone care about it.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.420
Yeah, but...

04:56.296 --> 04:58.131
I don't know, look at Denny.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.426
He came out here because he wanted
to know who his real grandfather is.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.345
He had a good life
before he knew about Doc.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.391
I'm sure he was missing something.

05:08.474 --> 05:12.812
Well, I can assure you,
our baby is not gonna be missing anything,

05:12.895 --> 05:15.606
because we'll love them
with everything we got.

05:19.193 --> 05:22.989
Still, I think it's better to know
the truth than live in denial.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.199
-Well, not always.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.536
Do you need to...?

05:28.619 --> 05:29.787
Yeah, I gotta--

05:29.871 --> 05:32.373
-Sorry, it's the bar. Gotta go.
-All right.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.042
-Can we talk about it later?
-Sure.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.793
-I love you.
-Love you too.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.721
<i>...identified himself</i>
<i>as Dr. Aaron Platt.</i>

05:46.804 --> 05:49.307
<i>-We asked him what had happened.</i>
-<i>That's hard to answer.</i>

05:49.390 --> 05:51.934
Honey, your neurologist's office called.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.730
They have a cancelation,
and they asked if you wanted the spot.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.024
Uh, let me think. No, thank you.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.026
I already accepted.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.653
Then you go.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.490
Look, we have to keep up
with your treatment.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.449
We?

06:06.532 --> 06:09.327
I don't see anyone
poking and prodding you.

06:09.410 --> 06:14.123
Once a month, I have needles
injected into my eyeballs.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.125
Fine.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.838
I have house calls to make.
I'll be back around 1 to pick you up.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.258
You don't need to do that.
I'll ask Jo Ellen to drive me.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.551
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.555
Well, thank you for cooperating.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.183
You're most welcome.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.536
<i>Dr. Freeman's office. How may we help you?</i>

06:51.619 --> 06:53.621
-This is Hope McCrea.
<i>-Hello.</i>

06:53.704 --> 06:56.749
I need to cancel today's appointment.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.002
<i>-The one you just made?</i>
-Yes, something came up.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.130
<i>Would you like to reschedule?</i>

07:02.213 --> 07:04.799
I don't have my calendar in front of me.
Um...

07:05.425 --> 07:07.385
I'll have to call you back. Bye.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.600
Still no leads on Vince?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.894
<i>Nah, none that have panned out yet.</i>

07:16.978 --> 07:20.064
With all of our technology,
how does a guy just vanish into thin air?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.650
He's a crooked cop,
knows how to disappear.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.777
<i>Preacher's putting on a good show,</i>

07:24.861 --> 07:26.904
but worrying about
Christopher is killing him.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.158
Trust me, Jack,
we're doing the best we can.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.286
You think Brady could've seen anything?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.371
Like a parked car outside the bar?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.582
When we interviewed him,
he said he didn't.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.001
That was a while back.
Maybe something's resurfaced?

07:40.084 --> 07:43.171
<i>Not sure it would do any good,</i>
<i>but you want me to talk to him again?</i>

07:43.254 --> 07:45.423
Nah. Nah, that's all right.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.341
I'm just thinking out loud.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.678
All right. Well, hey, if anything changes,

07:50.761 --> 07:51.846
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

07:51.929 --> 07:53.306
All right. Thanks, man.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.061
Come in.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.272
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.608
I talked to Mel. You guys okay?

08:04.233 --> 08:06.194
Yeah, thankfully.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.822
Wow. Sweet of her to surprise you
with a romantic getaway.

08:09.906 --> 08:14.035
-We didn't get very far.
-It's the thought that counts, huh?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.077
Yeah.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.455
-I'm glad you're okay.
-Thanks.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.501
Hey, listen, did Brady ever talk to you
about the night that I got shot?

08:21.584 --> 08:25.588
Um... I've asked him about it.
He's never said much.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.216
You think he'd talk to me?

08:29.175 --> 08:33.262
He kind of blames you for putting him
in jail and for getting stabbed.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.389
I didn't say it was rational.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.726
He might've seen something
that could help track down Vince.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.521
Okay. I'll ask him again.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.647
No, that's...

08:43.439 --> 08:45.358
It's cool. I'll handle it.

08:45.983 --> 08:46.817
Just--

08:47.902 --> 08:50.363
Just be cool with him, okay?

08:50.446 --> 08:52.198
What? I'm always cool.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.199
Oh.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.953
I'd love to debate that point,
but I've got work to do.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.462
Hey. You already done with Bert?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.798
Uh, no, he's asking for you.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.009
Oh. What did you do, make him mad?

09:12.093 --> 09:13.177
I don't think so.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.682
-Calm down. I'm just kidding.
-Remind me to never play poker with you.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.059
-You're impossible to read.
-I only play Go Fish.

09:20.142 --> 09:20.977
That's funny.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.647
-Hey, Bert.
-Hey.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.816
-What's up?
-It's about Shirley.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.444
I told her I hurt my shoulder because
it was the only way I could get her here.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.488
Okay. Well, what's going on?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.740
She's tired all the time,
and she's lost weight,

09:34.824 --> 09:37.076
and she stopped making
her famous peach cobblers.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.246
Is she having any chest pain?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.330
I don't know.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.208
Why hasn't she come into the clinic?

09:44.292 --> 09:47.253
I run my own business, but we still
can't afford health insurance.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.422
-Where is she?
-Outside, in the car.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.756
Okay.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.217
I'll go get her. All right?

09:53.301 --> 09:54.135
Okay.

10:00.975 --> 10:05.187
I talked to Brad, he sounded good
for a guy who just had a heart attack.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.981
He worked pararescue back in the day.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.316
With that kind of training,

10:08.399 --> 10:10.151
he probably could have
resuscitated himself.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.405
If you want to take the day off,
I got Hannah closing.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.783
-Oh, big plans?
-Oh, you know, I'm seeing Julia.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.995
-Oh, good for you.
-Yeah. Cooking for her.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.289
Is "cooking" code for something else?

10:23.372 --> 10:25.833
-No. I'm not thinking about that.
-Okay.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.835
No, she-- You know, she's great.

10:27.918 --> 10:31.088
-I just don't want to rush anything.
-Yeah, I get it.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.050
Think he's got a shot
at getting Lizzie back?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.926
Well, for his sake, I hope so.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.304
So I saw your aunt last night.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.432
She and my grandmother
are working on costumes for the fair.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.558
That's nice.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.476
Yeah.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.728
Are you still performing?

10:46.771 --> 10:50.024
It's kind of hard to do
<i>Romeo and Juliet </i>without Romeo.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.986
Maybe you should've
broken up with me after the fair.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.530
Do you really wanna go there?

10:57.948 --> 10:58.783
No.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.994
What about Denny? Did you ask him?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.079
I did.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.375
He said no.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.126
Bummer.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.504
I can see you're broken up about it.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.714
No, I'm being serious, you know.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.633
I know how much you want to play Juliet.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.134
The dress is so pretty.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.721
You know, technically,

11:20.805 --> 11:22.807
I am still available.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.017
That's a terrible idea.

11:25.101 --> 11:25.935
Why?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.812
The scene ends with a kiss.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.147
Well, we don't have to kiss.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.024
We can just, like, hug.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.069
-Do you even remember your lines?
-Sure.

11:35.152 --> 11:35.986
Really?

11:36.070 --> 11:39.073
Look, we can try the scene,
and if it's too weird,

11:39.782 --> 11:41.701
we can just forget about it.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.371
Fine. Meet me at Tara's
after your shift, and we can rehearse.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.372
All right.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.838
Bert's such a Nervous Pervis these days.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.466
How long have you had this rash?

11:58.050 --> 12:01.762
It's just a little rosacea.
All the women in my family have it.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.224
Is it constant, or do you get flare-ups?

12:05.307 --> 12:09.311
It gets worse in the sun,
and I did some gardening yesterday, so...

12:11.522 --> 12:14.442
-Any joint pain?
-How much time do you have?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.367
Any numbness?

12:23.451 --> 12:26.078
Sometimes. When I'm under stress.

12:26.162 --> 12:26.996
Like now.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.263
Good morning.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.480
Enjoying that cup of joe?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.399
Cup of joe? Coffee?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.568
Sorry, I'm not totally awake yet.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.779
-Ah.
-Hey, morning, Doc.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.282
Morning, Jack. This is my grandson, Denny.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.160
-Oh, yeah. Hey, man. Good to meet you.
-Yeah.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.997
-How's your trip going so far?
-Awesome. I'm staying at the B&B.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.083
-Ooh. Nick's snoring keeping you awake?
-Thought I was being sensitive.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.419
No, Nick even wakes himself up.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.131
I'd offer you a room above the bar,
but my sister's staying there.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.927
I appreciate that offer, Jack,
but I'm working on a solution.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.887
Great. Well, good to meet you.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.014
-Welcome to Virgin River.
-Thanks.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.559
I wanted to talk to you about the B&B.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.021
I mean, normally I'd invite you
to stay with me and Hope,

13:34.104 --> 13:36.065
but she's just not up for houseguests now.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.067
Of course, I totally understand.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.151
And the B&B is fine.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.320
I think we can do better than fine.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.948
There is a bedroom
on the second floor of the clinic.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.659
You'll be much more comfortable there.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.828
I just, um-- I don't wanna bother anyone.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.164
Well, you're not a bother, you're family.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.125
Well, that'd be great.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.085
Excellent.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.130
Bring your stuff by the clinic,
and I'll show you all around.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.716
-That's generous of you.
-Don't give it another thought.

14:04.718 --> 14:05.678
Hey.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.930
Thanks for meeting me.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.809
It sounded important.
Plus, there's donuts.

14:11.892 --> 14:15.646
Look, you won't like what I have to say,
but I'm asking you to keep an open mind.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.690
That's quite the disclaimer.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.984
I need you to go
to the bondsman's office with me

14:20.067 --> 14:22.403
so we can find out
who posted Brady's bail.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.781
-Brie, we've been over this already.
-This isn't just about Brady.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.074
Until Vince is in custody,

14:27.157 --> 14:30.077
the guy who shot my brother
is still out there.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.580
We're working on it, you have my word.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.040
-I thought you were after Calvin's boss.
-Yeah, I am.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.251
I think those things are connected.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.961
Connected how?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.629
Whoever framed Brady

14:41.130 --> 14:43.173
framed him using Vince's gun.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.718
-To what end?
-Control.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.013
They put Brady in prison,
and then got him out.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.182
That is a lot of leverage
to have over someone.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.101
-Maybe, but--
-Please.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.729
Just this one thing.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.523
I'll buy you lunch afterward.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.944
You're insinuating that I can be bought.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.739
If it'll make you feel better,
we can split it.

15:08.032 --> 15:08.908
All right.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.119
I'll do it.

15:12.202 --> 15:17.207
All right? Just-- After this,
just leave the police work to me.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.209
Thank you. And I will.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.717
We'd like to screen Shirley's samples
for autoimmune diseases.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.135
What kind of diseases?

15:28.218 --> 15:31.680
Fibromyalgia,
rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, celiac.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.099
-Didn't your--?
-I don't think you'll find anything,

15:34.183 --> 15:36.143
but keep us posted. Bert, we need to go.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.269
We're staying.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.732
Is there something you're not telling us?

15:41.815 --> 15:44.401
Her aunt had the lupus, whatever that is.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.111
Right.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.616
Lupus is when your immune system
attacks your body.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.411
Why didn't you tell me
you weren't feeling well?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.246
Oh. I thought it would pass.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.625
So, what's the cure?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.670
Unfortunately, there is none.

16:03.629 --> 16:08.717
But with medications and treatments,
you can help control the symptoms.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.928
Absolutely not.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.846
Lupus practically bankrupted my aunt.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.306
Now, hold on.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.018
If she doesn't accept treatment,
then what happens?

16:19.103 --> 16:23.440
Left untreated,
lupus can result in heart failure,

16:23.524 --> 16:25.442
kidney failure, stroke.

16:26.068 --> 16:31.907
Of course, you will need to see
a specialist for an official diagnosis.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.619
But once you have that,
and with proper treatment,

16:35.703 --> 16:38.414
lupus patients can live
long and healthy lives.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.083
Well, I don't care what the cost is.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.292
Go ahead, tell him.

16:43.210 --> 16:47.506
Treatment can run up as high
as $36,000 per year.

16:47.589 --> 16:51.635
But there are federal programs
that can help offset the costs.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.097
By the end of the month, we barely
have two nickels to rub together.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.351
Maybe the annual picnic
can help make up the difference.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.021
-We are not comfortable with charity.
-The hell we aren't.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.231
You need medicine.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.985
I'll be glad to set my pride aside
and beg on the street if I have to.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.112
-I won't let you do that.
-It's not up to you.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.781
I'm being selfish.

17:14.825 --> 17:15.868
I can't lose you.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.456
Shirley, it's because of you
I have a life.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.834
Oh, Bert.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.002
Come here.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.554
Okay, Lizzie's hemline is done.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.975
If only Muriel would sew
half as fast as you.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.436
Perfection cannot be rushed.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.855
Oh, sure, it can.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.690
Here, finish this.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.650
-Oh.

17:48.734 --> 17:53.655
Anyway, Hope, it is so lovely
that you have joined us today.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.992
I had an opening in my schedule.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.619
Hey, speaking of schedule,

17:58.702 --> 18:02.247
are you going to do
your opening remarks at the fair?

18:03.123 --> 18:04.958
Uh, I'm not sure I'm going.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.502
Oh, but you have to go.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.337
If it's too much trouble,

18:08.420 --> 18:11.965
I'd be happy to give
the opening remarks for you.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.550
Be my guest.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.764
But you'll still attend, right?

18:19.681 --> 18:20.933
I'll think about it.

18:21.475 --> 18:25.437
Don't worry, Doc texted me
a reminder about your appointment.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.439
We should go so you're not late.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.233
The appointment got canceled.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.859
Doc didn't tell me that.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.820
They called right before you came over.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.490
Oh, Tara, hand me
another skirt from Muriel's pile.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.787
Thank you.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.540
No way in hell.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.667
Okay, you're not listening to me.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002
Dan Brady is a flight risk.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.963
-That's for a judge to decide.
-Okay.

18:51.046 --> 18:55.134
He jumps bail, you're not seeing
any of that cash, okay?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.636
You might be here for a while.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.013
Thank you.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.057
Is that your partner?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.559
Unfortunately.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.936
He's a total caveman.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.188
He must be related to my boss.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.234
-I'm Brie, by the way.
-Susan.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.697
Susan, how long you been working here?

19:17.447 --> 19:20.033
-Too long.
-You ever think about doing anything else?

19:20.117 --> 19:24.204
I got a record,
so I don't have a lot of choices.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.082
-Brie, you coming?
-Mm.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.000
In a minute.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.965
Damn it. This is gonna blow
the whole case for me.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.884
We need that name for court.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.928
Sorry, I wish I could help.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.807
Yeah. Pretty sure your boss
would have an issue with that.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.476
Sherrie! Get your butt in here.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.980
What do I care?
He takes issue with everything.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.733
-Sherrie!
-Hey, douchebag.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.735
Her name is Susan.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.906
Seriously, if he keeps talking
to you like that, you let me know.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.866
My best friend is an employment attorney.

20:00.949 --> 20:04.912
You could sue him for creating
a hostile work environment.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.581
Wow. Uh, thanks.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.749
Anytime.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.251
Oh, and, um...

20:11.877 --> 20:15.047
if you do happen to come across
any information about Dan Brady

20:15.130 --> 20:16.381
that you can share...

20:16.882 --> 20:17.925
I'd owe you one.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.426
Bye.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.309
That was a waste of time.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.687
Um, that guy was never gonna give names.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.775
But sometimes, when properly incentivized,
assistants can be helpful.

20:37.236 --> 20:41.031
This wasn't about the bondsman,
it was about you getting to the assistant?

20:41.114 --> 20:41.949
Pretty much.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.992
Okay, why didn't you tell me?

20:44.076 --> 20:46.036
I didn't know
how good of an actor you'd be.

20:46.995 --> 20:47.913
Yeah.

20:48.497 --> 20:52.042
-So where are we going for lunch?
-You probably already know.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.837
Donatella's in Clear River.
I made a reservation.

20:55.921 --> 20:56.964
Yeah.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.385
-Hey.
-Hey, you.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.470
Hi. Uh, can we talk for a second?

21:03.553 --> 21:04.680
Sure.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.977
I feel like we left things
in a weird place this morning.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.187
Okay.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.734
You said that knowing the truth
isn't always better.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.530
But the thing is,
is that the truth usually comes out.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.951
I mean, it might take decades,
but it usually does.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.998
If it comes up and there's an issue,
we'll deal with it then.

21:31.081 --> 21:35.168
I don't understand how you can live
with that kind of uncertainty.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.462
Uncertainty is a part of life.

21:37.546 --> 21:41.216
Yeah, but aren't you tired of wondering?

21:42.217 --> 21:43.427
I'm not thinking about it.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.723
-How is that possible?
-Because I choose not to.

21:48.473 --> 21:53.353
I'm sorry, but it's too big of a question
for me to pretend it doesn't exist.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.984
Is there no way you can let this go?

22:02.612 --> 22:05.866
No, I can't.
I can't ignore this the way that you can.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.747
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I wish that I could, but I just-- I can't.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.547
Okay. I'm gonna go back to work.

22:22.132 --> 22:22.966
Okay.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.619
Sorry I'm late.
I had to drop off some samples at the lab.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.121
What are you doing out here?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.040
I wasn't sure if I should go in.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.958
Of course you should.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.752
Come on. Let's meet the team.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.802
Uh, bedroom, top of the stairs,
on the left.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.557
Mel, say hello to my grandson, Denny.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.643
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.977
Hey, you too.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.147
Cam. Come say hi to my grandson.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.024
-Denny.
-Hey there.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.401
Boy, am I glad you are here,

23:22.484 --> 23:25.821
because you get to be the new guy
and I can just fade into the background.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.824
-Cameron just moved here.
-Ah. Glad I could help.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.244
Yeah, and thanks
for accommodating Denny's stay upstairs.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.372
Hope's not up
for a houseguest at the moment.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.581
Of course, anytime.

23:37.332 --> 23:41.169
I'm happy to have you join the fray.
I'm gonna go run before it gets too late.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.088
Have fun.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.590
-See you tomorrow, nice meeting you.
-Bye.

23:46.258 --> 23:50.345
Oh, when you have time,
I just have to fill you in on a case.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.388
-Okay.
-I'll go--

23:51.471 --> 23:52.556
No, no. So you have this.

23:52.639 --> 23:57.894
This is the alarm code instructions
and the keys, and that'll do it.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.147
-Thanks again.
-Yeah, welcome.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.232
-Bye.
-Oh, bye, nice to meet you.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.695
All right,
you have my undivided attention.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.781
Okay, so Shirley and Bert were in today.

24:09.865 --> 24:13.201
Shirley's going to the hospital tomorrow
for some tests.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.245
Cameron and I think it's lupus.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.165
-Ooh. I'd like to see her chart...
-Mm-hm.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.293
and they must be devastated.

24:21.376 --> 24:23.170
Yeah, Bert definitely is.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.923
But I think that Shirley
suspected for a while.

24:27.632 --> 24:31.386
A problem doesn't go away
just because you don't wanna face it.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.347
Yeah. They are facing
a pretty harsh reality.

24:34.890 --> 24:39.060
Yeah, it's true,
but people are surprisingly adaptive.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.687
Yeah, I agree.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.566
I mean, look at how fast you adapted
to becoming a grandfather.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.028
Yeah. Denny, he's a good kid.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.822
He just... seems a little lost.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.742
-Do you think that's why he came here?
-Possibly.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.744
Well, I'm glad he found you.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.078
Yeah, thanks.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.081
I hope he sticks around
so we can get to know each other.

25:00.165 --> 25:03.418
Yeah. Did he ever say
why he just showed up on your doorstep

25:03.502 --> 25:05.003
instead of calling or e-mailing?

25:05.086 --> 25:08.590
Well, I think he felt he'd get
a better sense of me in person.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.467
That was a bold move.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.513
Understanding your family tree
helps some people understand themselves.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.766
Why do you think that is?

25:18.433 --> 25:22.395
Well, same reason we teach history.
The past shapes the future.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.107
Yeah.

25:39.871 --> 25:43.124
-We need to talk.
-I don't got anything to say to you.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.669
I need to know what happened
the night of the shooting.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.214
Sounds like a you problem.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.841
I'm asking for your help.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.680
I almost got killed because of you.

25:57.556 --> 26:02.102
-You went into business with Calvin.
-You're right. This is my fault.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.648
Why'd you come to the bar that night?

26:08.733 --> 26:11.069
Whatever it was,
it must've been real important.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.698
I told you to stay away, but you didn't.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.200
When have I ever listened to you, Jack?

26:17.284 --> 26:18.910
I know you're pissed at me.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.789
But I saved your ass more than once.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.419
Fine. Thought I was doing the right thing.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.089
Came to tell you
there was gonna be a raid at Calvin's.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.300
I turned state evidence.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.884
Made a deal with the DA.

26:36.136 --> 26:39.514
-I'm the reason Calvin's going down.
-So you sold your friends out, huh?

26:39.598 --> 26:41.224
No, I did the right thing.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.395
Listen, I'm getting out.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.231
I'm going legit from here on.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.232
Wow.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.778
Congratulations on ending your career
as a drug dealer.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.114
Jesus.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.701
Come on, man. I'm trying here.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.996
-Why do you gotta be an asshole?
-What do you want? You want a medal?

27:04.372 --> 27:05.707
You want a parade?

27:07.500 --> 27:10.378
Look, doing the right thing
is what you're supposed to do.

27:10.920 --> 27:15.258
It doesn't make you special,
it just makes you a decent human being.

27:18.887 --> 27:19.721
We're done here.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.058
I was supposed to get caught in the raid.

27:23.141 --> 27:28.104
So no one would get suspicious,
but when I got there, it was already over.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.522
And Mike knew this?

27:29.606 --> 27:30.482
Oh, yeah.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.484
He set it up.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.943
Then why didn't he tell me?

27:34.027 --> 27:35.654
You'd have to ask him.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.198
The only reason I told you was...

27:38.740 --> 27:41.284
in case something happened to me, I...

27:42.661 --> 27:44.704
wanted you to know
I was trying to get out.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.124
Okay.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.253
You remember anything else?

27:52.837 --> 27:56.174
The police timeline has you
and the shooter possibly crossing paths.

27:56.257 --> 27:58.426
-No.
-A parked car outside the bar?

27:59.135 --> 28:00.136
No.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.472
-There must have been something.
-I said no.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.349
This is important. Will you think?

28:04.432 --> 28:06.142
Jack. Nothing.

28:22.992 --> 28:23.993
Thanks, Ricky.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.834
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.335
Oh. Great minds.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.255
I cannot resist Preacher's panna cotta.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.757
I am picking some up as a treat for Hope.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.092
I saw her today.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.261
Oh. Where?

28:41.344 --> 28:45.306
Oh, we spent the afternoon at Lily's,
sewing costumes for the Renaissance Faire.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.476
I'm surprised she could fit that in,
with her doctor's appointment.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.520
Oh, no. She said that got canceled.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.316
-Oh.
-Yeah. Can I ask you something?

28:55.400 --> 28:56.693
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

28:56.776 --> 29:00.196
So word around town
is that you have a grandson?

29:00.280 --> 29:03.074
Oh, it's true. His name is Denny.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.326
And you didn't know he existed?

29:05.410 --> 29:07.287
Not until he showed up.

29:08.788 --> 29:09.622
Look.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.751
As soon as I heard about your grandson,

29:12.834 --> 29:15.628
I could not help
but think about Laney Baxter.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.714
And what about her?

29:17.797 --> 29:20.508
A niece that she barely knew came to visit

29:20.592 --> 29:23.303
and then talked Laney
into letting her move in.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.387
Okay.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.974
And then a month or two later,
she got access to Laney's bank account,

29:28.057 --> 29:30.894
took all of her money
and then skipped town.

29:31.644 --> 29:36.691
So, wait, you're saying that Denny
has come here to steal from me?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.694
I'm saying you should be careful.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.030
I appreciate your concern.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.784
I just don't get the sense
that Denny is here for money.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.327
Probably not.

29:47.410 --> 29:50.914
But you do know it never hurts
to exercise a little caution.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.541
Bye, Doc.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.092
Sorry, I'll be right out.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.594
Oh, no, take your time.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.100
Uh, Lizzie said you left.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.687
I did. But I'm back with dinner.

30:14.771 --> 30:15.855
Oh, okay.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.441
Question is, what are you doing here?

30:18.525 --> 30:20.860
Uh, we're rehearsing.

30:29.035 --> 30:29.953
Wow.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.371
I feel like a princess.

30:31.454 --> 30:34.249
Oh, you look like one too.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.126
Do you wanna try the scene?

30:37.210 --> 30:38.378
Yeah, sure.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.965
-I'll be your audience.
-Oh. You don't have to do that.

30:42.048 --> 30:46.386
Oh, if you can't perform in front of me,
how are you gonna handle a crowd?

30:47.679 --> 30:48.763
-Ready?
-Yep.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.517
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.936
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

30:55.019 --> 30:58.606
Uh, have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

30:58.690 --> 31:01.818
Aye, pilgrim,
lips that they must use in prayer.

31:01.901 --> 31:05.738
Uh, O, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do;

31:05.822 --> 31:09.158
they pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.078
You totally know your lines.

31:12.161 --> 31:13.830
Yeah, I told you.

31:13.913 --> 31:14.789
All right.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.542
-Dinner's waiting.
-I'm gonna go change.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.961
-I don't wanna spill on my dress.
-Okay.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.756
Oh.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.676
You're quite the actor.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.511
-Uh-- Thanks.
-Uh-huh.

31:29.012 --> 31:32.307
It's as if you've been
practicing all along.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.310
Okay, fine.
I've been cramming all afternoon, okay?

31:35.852 --> 31:36.811
Oh...

31:37.395 --> 31:40.064
Ricky, I say this for your benefit:

31:40.148 --> 31:44.235
Performing a scene with Lizzie
doesn't mean she's gonna take you back.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.113
-Okay?
-Okay.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.295
So you said that you moved around a lot.

32:02.378 --> 32:06.090
Yeah, I went to six different schools.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.926
And that was before high school.

32:08.551 --> 32:10.053
Oh, it must have been hard.

32:10.845 --> 32:14.432
Well, it wasn't easy,
but I learned to adjust.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.601
-You know, blend in.
-Mm.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.603
I get it.

32:18.686 --> 32:22.231
There were only two Black kids
in my high school, and I was one of them.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.567
-They give you any trouble?
-No, no.

32:24.651 --> 32:27.487
It's just-- I never felt like I fit in.

32:27.570 --> 32:31.741
Yeah. It wasn't until I joined up
that I started to figure myself out.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.910
-Yeah? Is that when you started cooking?
-Mm-hm.

32:33.993 --> 32:36.996
Well, the Marines,
they taught me how to dismantle an IED

32:37.080 --> 32:38.873
and make the perfect omelet.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.250
Talk about
a well-rounded education, right?

32:41.334 --> 32:42.418
Right.

32:42.502 --> 32:45.046
Yeah. So, what about you?
Where did you go to college?

32:45.129 --> 32:48.591
Oh, I went to Morgan State,
and I absolutely loved it.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.927
What was it that made it so special?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.178
I don't know, it, um...

32:54.472 --> 32:56.265
It just felt like home.

33:11.656 --> 33:15.660
I should start that fire,
or we'll be eating dinner at midnight.

33:16.953 --> 33:17.787
Okay.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.790
Uh, what do you want me to do?

33:21.749 --> 33:23.710
-You could unpack the food?
-Okay.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.009
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.095
You okay?

34:17.013 --> 34:21.642
Yeah. I just went up
to Emerald Lumber looking for Brady.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.561
Oh, how did that go?

34:26.314 --> 34:27.148
Fine.

34:29.609 --> 34:30.485
You all right?

34:32.695 --> 34:37.200
Look, it's probably not the right time
to talk about this right now, but I...

34:39.744 --> 34:42.830
I can't leave this paternity issue
up in the air.

34:44.040 --> 34:44.874
Well...

34:46.125 --> 34:48.086
we're compromising, right?
I mean, either...

34:49.462 --> 34:52.340
you don't take the test
and you're unhappy or I give in and...

34:54.884 --> 34:56.803
I can't do that right now.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.559
Can you at least tell me why?

35:04.519 --> 35:07.772
And don't--
Don't say that the results don't matter.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.691
Maybe it'll help me understand
where you're coming from.

35:18.574 --> 35:19.659
Honestly, I...

35:21.160 --> 35:23.079
don't think I'm ever gonna want to know.

35:25.873 --> 35:26.833
Why not?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.753
Because if we find out
that Mark's the father,

35:30.837 --> 35:33.214
it could change how I feel about our baby.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.676
-We know that that isn't gonna happen.
-Do we?

35:38.636 --> 35:41.722
It's nice to think that,
it's nice to say that, but...

35:43.516 --> 35:46.018
I'm not 100% sure
that it's not gonna change how I feel.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.146
And I don't wanna take that risk.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.026
Why didn't you just tell me this?

35:54.110 --> 35:55.695
Oh, come on, babe.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.657
I didn't even...

36:00.700 --> 36:02.785
I didn't even know what I felt.

36:03.953 --> 36:04.787
You know?

36:05.705 --> 36:08.791
I just wanted to have an open mind.
I didn't want to upset you.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.210
I'm not upset.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.839
I'm just processing.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.888
I think I need some space
to clear my head.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.724
You want me to leave?

36:24.807 --> 36:26.684
No. No.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.395
I'm gonna take a walk.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.857
I'll be back in a little bit.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.817
I'll leave the light on.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.159
-Oh.
-Hey.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.076
Hi.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.997
Hey, I got you a little something
for going to the doctor's today.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.708
But I heard it got canceled?

36:51.375 --> 36:53.169
No. Who told you that?

36:53.669 --> 36:55.046
Oh, Muriel.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.758
Muriel's so caught up
in organizing the Renaissance Faire,

36:58.841 --> 37:02.386
she can barely remember her own name,
much less keep track of what I'm doing.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.972
All right, then. What did the doctor say?

37:05.056 --> 37:07.975
Nothing worth mentioning.
What's with all the questions?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.895
Just making conversation.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.438
There's a lasagna in the oven.

37:12.521 --> 37:15.316
Took me the better part
of the day to make it.

37:15.858 --> 37:21.030
Why don't you pour yourself a drink
and I'll go freshen up, okay?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.255
Hi, Jo Ellen, it's Vernon.

37:37.838 --> 37:39.840
Uh, fine. Thanks.

37:40.466 --> 37:43.552
Listen, how did things go
at Hope's neurologist?

37:46.305 --> 37:47.848
They called her to cancel.

37:49.058 --> 37:53.688
No, no, no, not at all. No, no.
Hope told me. I just-- I forgot.

37:53.771 --> 37:54.605
That's all.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.233
Okay. Thanks.

37:57.316 --> 37:58.484
Have a good night.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.348
What are you doing?
