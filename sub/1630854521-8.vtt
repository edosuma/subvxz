WEBVTT

00:20.312 --> 00:21.397
I love this one.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.523
Turn it up.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.511
Dad!

01:45.189 --> 01:48.943
I don't know if this has happened to you,
but I was in the car and I'm driving

01:48.943 --> 01:53.948
and I have to go to the washroom so bad,
I really have to go and I'm driving...

02:10.256 --> 02:14.051
Armand, at last.
You saved us from one of Pierre's stories.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.053
Finishing up work.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.013
We didn't think you were going to make it.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.308
And miss games night?
Not the Armand I know and love.

02:22.268 --> 02:26.272
Especially after I won so big last week.

02:26.856 --> 02:29.775
What shall we play?
Belote? Aluette? Blackjack?

02:29.775 --> 02:31.610
Oh, Blackjack. British rules.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.112
British rules, again?

02:33.112 --> 02:36.156
Would you like
a crumpet and some tea with that?

02:36.156 --> 02:39.493
Don't tease Pierre
or he'll have us playing Old Maid again.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.203
- Yeah.
- Who's the dealer?

02:41.203 --> 02:42.496
Oh, Pierre, of course.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.832
He knows all about dealers.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.959
Okay. Okay.

02:47.543 --> 02:51.797
Two cards,
twist or stick for another three.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.634
I heard you found those missing kids.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.802
- We did.
- Twist.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.304
Wow.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.514
- Yes.
- Bust.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.224
- Too bad.
- Twist.

03:03.058 --> 03:06.061
Thank God that poor family
gets some closure.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.688
- Yeah.
- Twist again.

03:10.316 --> 03:11.317
I'm bust, too.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.193
So you think it was Kevin Kis?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.197
Maybe Kevin was lying.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.200
What if Tommy caught him
fooling around with Blue

03:20.200 --> 03:24.079
and then they got into a fight
and he ended up killing them both?

03:26.165 --> 03:27.833
Yeah, you might be right.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.003
I bet he OD'd in that cell out of guilt.

03:31.003 --> 03:34.256
But then... why would Chowski run?

03:37.593 --> 03:38.510
Twist.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.596
Chowski's a wild card.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.807
Maybe he got in deep with Kis.
I don't know.

03:43.807 --> 03:44.850
Could be.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.269
But it's a homicide investigation now,

03:47.269 --> 03:49.647
so it's up to me
to get to the bottom of it.

03:49.647 --> 03:50.689
Twist.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.110
How did you find them, anyway?

03:58.197 --> 04:00.032
Do you know how many different

04:00.032 --> 04:02.576
kinds of pine tree there
are in that forest?

04:02.576 --> 04:03.744
There's a lot.

04:03.744 --> 04:08.040
There's jack pine, sand pine,
table mountain pine,

04:08.040 --> 04:09.750
pitch pine, pond pine.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.336
There's even white pine,

04:12.336 --> 04:15.714
although they're not so popular
in the eastern townships.

04:15.714 --> 04:19.843
The man we found last week
was hanging right by a white pine tree.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.846
They have very particular needles.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.390
They get everywhere.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.351
We actually found some
in Kevin Kis' place.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.563
Wow!

04:32.272 --> 04:35.567
Sounds to me like
that puts Chowski in the clear

04:35.567 --> 04:38.070
and Kevin Kis at the scene of the crime.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.658
Good work, Armand. That is good work.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.708
You wanna twist or stick?

04:53.085 --> 04:54.169
I want to twist.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.506
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.632
All right.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.889
There's one Ojibwe story that I like.

05:07.016 --> 05:10.894
There's this little blue jay.
She's cold, starving.

05:11.937 --> 05:15.149
She flies to the oak tree
and begs for shelter.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.818
And the oak tree says, "No way,

05:17.818 --> 05:20.029
"I've barely got enough for myself."

05:20.029 --> 05:24.033
So she flies to the maple
and she begs the maple tree for some sap.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.995
The maple tree says,
"I don't have enough for myself."

05:28.412 --> 05:32.833
And every tree in the forest
sends the blue jay away cold and starving.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.712
So she flies all the way
to the pine forest,

05:36.712 --> 05:41.216
and she says to the pine trees, "I'm cold.
I'm starving. Can I shelter here?

05:41.216 --> 05:43.510
"At least until the blizzard passes."

05:43.927 --> 05:47.222
And the pine trees say,
"Sure, our needles are so thin.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.724
"But sure, come on in.

05:49.516 --> 05:54.813
"Shelter. Stay warm among our branches.
Feed from the seeds in our pine cones."

05:56.190 --> 06:00.110
And just then, the blue jay shakes off

06:00.110 --> 06:03.989
all her tail feathers
and reveals her true self.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.075
And she's not a blue jay at all.

06:06.075 --> 06:11.830
She's Nanabozho, the trickster,
and she says, "All the trees in the forest

06:11.830 --> 06:14.792
"will lose all their leaves every winter.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.252
"But you pine trees were so kind to me,

06:18.128 --> 06:20.214
"you're going to keep your leaves

06:20.214 --> 06:23.217
"and you're going to stay green
all year round."

06:34.103 --> 06:37.648
You know, parables do have many meanings.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.735
Never prejudge a person
based upon their appearance.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.615
There's bound to be a whole other story
waiting to be discovered.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.659
It's true.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.913
You never really know who anyone is.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.507
Five card trick.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.927
Well played.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.452
What was all that
between you and Pierre tonight?

07:34.872 --> 07:36.290
Is it about those kids?

07:39.543 --> 07:40.961
Armand, tell me.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.797
I know who killed them.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.717
Well, that's good, isn't it?

07:46.717 --> 07:47.843
No.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.015
The bullet that...

07:53.765 --> 07:58.687
The bullets that killed Blue
came from Pierre's gun.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.232
What?

08:03.066 --> 08:04.526
How is that possible?

08:07.404 --> 08:08.864
My god.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.922
Pierre Arnot is a good man.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.381
A great officer.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.885
What we found matches
what Kevin Kis said to Lacoste.

08:30.761 --> 08:34.514
We know Chowski and Arnot
pulled over Kevin's truck.

08:35.807 --> 08:39.311
I think they buried the bodies
and then staged Kevin's place

08:39.311 --> 08:42.272
in the hope that the peacekeepers
would find Blue's blood

08:42.272 --> 08:44.441
and conclude that Kevin killed her.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.735
It's all in here.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.322
And the bullets are with SQ ballistics.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.327
Armand.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.831
I realize this can't be easy for you.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.166
I'm sorry.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.711
We'll have to hand this over
to Internal Affairs.

09:04.711 --> 09:08.882
You get back to Three Pines and wrap up
the Hill case, I'll deal with this, okay?

09:08.882 --> 09:09.967
Thank you.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.058
How was the vacation?

10:01.893 --> 10:02.811
Good.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.734
Things are good with you and Enid now?

10:11.903 --> 10:14.406
Totally. Yeah. It was just what we needed.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.910
Good. I mean, I don't know
who else would have you, so...

10:21.997 --> 10:25.125
- Actually, things aren't exactly...
- You okay, Patron?

10:25.834 --> 10:28.378
I want this case
wrapped up quickly, today.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.088
We're working on it.

10:30.088 --> 10:33.550
James Hill came here
looking for someone from his past.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.762
Take a deep dive into his background.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.222
Find me a connection
to someone in Three Pines.

10:56.365 --> 10:59.618
- What's all this about?
- Police won't be going anywhere.

10:59.618 --> 11:03.038
They're going to be here
until someone's behind bars.

11:03.038 --> 11:06.333
- The killer, with a bit of luck.
- We make our own luck.

11:06.458 --> 11:10.712
You heard Ellis in the bistro.
He knew we're all guilty of something.

11:12.339 --> 11:16.218
Only one person killed that man.
That's who the police are after.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.969
The rest of us
have got nothing to do with it.

11:17.969 --> 11:21.932
Oh, yeah? What if he really
did know our secrets?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.059
What if he made a record?

11:24.059 --> 11:26.645
Police are going to be checking his place.

11:26.645 --> 11:30.273
- Don't you think you're being dramatic?
- I'm being cautious.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.236
I know I got things in my past
that I don't want airing.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.696
My guess is that most of you have, too.

11:36.696 --> 11:41.159
Isn't that why we came here?
To start again without judgment?

11:41.827 --> 11:43.578
Our own sanctuary.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.915
You want the police
digging around in your dirt?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.126
So what's the plan?

11:49.126 --> 11:51.962
- Ducks don't feed themselves...
- Wait.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.172
Read it.

11:55.215 --> 11:59.636
It's a perfect lesson
in social responsibility

12:00.011 --> 12:02.848
and why you never want to be
the bystander.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.933
<i>Hangman</i> poem. Great fucking plan.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.603
If anyone here knows
who killed Arthur Ellis,

12:08.603 --> 12:12.399
if anyone here knows anything at all,
they got two choices.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.402
Speak to me or speak to the Chief.

12:16.278 --> 12:20.407
But let's get this investigation shut down
before it hurts us all.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.626
This is Sergeant Lacoste
of the Sûreté du Québec.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.171
I'm calling about James Hill.

12:34.171 --> 12:37.007
Myrna Landers used to be a psychologist?

12:37.007 --> 12:39.593
<i>Any information you have would be helpful.</i>

12:40.135 --> 12:41.803
The poet, Ruth Zardo.

12:42.179 --> 12:46.016
I understand she led some classes
at the faculty a few years back?

12:46.016 --> 12:48.477
<i>When was the last time she taught there?</i>

12:51.396 --> 12:53.815
<i>They were students
at which university?</i>

12:53.815 --> 12:55.609
<i>From what year to what year?</i>

13:00.989 --> 13:02.574
<i>Peter and Clara Morrow.</i>

13:02.949 --> 13:04.868
<i>M-O-R-R-O-W.</i>

13:06.411 --> 13:08.246
<i>What date did they live there?</i>

13:09.247 --> 13:12.459
I'm trying to get dates on
when Gabri Dubeau was there.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.669
How long were they in Ottawa?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.592
What was their address?

13:20.592 --> 13:25.263
<i>When Olivier Brulé was in
Ottawa, did he run any other businesses?</i>

13:25.972 --> 13:27.599
<i>I can hold. Thank you.</i>

13:32.687 --> 13:37.150
- You stare at this shit all day.
- Ruth. Something I can help you with?

13:37.651 --> 13:40.654
- Found this.
- We don't exactly handle lost property.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.822
Look inside, smart arse.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.959
That's him, isn't it? Arthur Ellis.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.044
His real name is James Hill.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.003
No shit.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.049
- Where'd you find it?
- Rosa found it.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.261
It was in the bonfire pile behind the B,

14:04.261 --> 14:08.890
where Mike burns the garden waste.
Rosa likes to forage in the cuttings.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.142
Snails are plenty in there.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.520
Rosa has sophisticated taste.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.105
Great source of collagen.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.816
Keeps your beak strong.

14:20.694 --> 14:21.695
So who exactly...

14:45.218 --> 14:46.136
Mike.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.056
Chief Inspector.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.517
When did you build this?

14:53.602 --> 14:55.103
Over the past week or so.

14:55.687 --> 14:59.190
Had a lot of dried leaves
and grass cuttings needed burning.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.527
Are police checking bonfire permits now?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.822
You see anyone tamper with it?

15:06.698 --> 15:09.075
- Tamper?
- Putting something in it.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.411
No.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.541
- Why, is there something in there?
- It was a long shot. Thank you.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.752
- Sure.
- Oh...

15:18.752 --> 15:21.671
Did you play at university?

15:22.922 --> 15:26.009
Uh, no. I didn't go to university.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.720
Yeah, well, it's not for everyone.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.103
Thank you.

15:48.406 --> 15:51.993
I think the initials in
Hill's wallet might be a kill list.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.664
How'd you get that
from a bunch of initials?

15:55.664 --> 15:57.791
Hill worked as a clerk

15:57.791 --> 16:02.379
for the Department of Records in Ottawa.
It's taxes, passports, court papers.

16:02.379 --> 16:05.840
Anytime a Canadian comes into contact
with the government,

16:05.840 --> 16:07.676
the records end up there.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.261
Thus giving him access
to personal information.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.098
That's right. He got the job 15 years ago.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.850
Before that, he was a teacher.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.645
It's a big change,
going from working with kids

16:18.645 --> 16:20.146
to filing records.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.190
So what happened 15 years ago?

16:30.198 --> 16:34.035
<i>Margaret Hill and 10-year-old Debbie
were killed when their car went off</i>

16:34.035 --> 16:37.914
<i>into St. Lawrence River.
Witnesses saw a red pickup truck</i>

16:37.914 --> 16:42.127
<i>collide with the Hill's car
and plow it off the bridge into the water.</i>

16:42.127 --> 16:45.714
<i>Sûreté du Québec are appealing
for witnesses to come forward</i>

16:45.714 --> 16:50.009
<i>and are understood to be questioning
four teenagers from Université Laval</i>

16:50.009 --> 16:51.302
<i>about the incidents.</i>

16:52.053 --> 16:57.100
Two boys, Gabriel Duval and Toby Marsh,
two girls, Cindy Payne and Eliza Green.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.686
Same initials as we found
in Hill's wallet.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.229
And the truck...

17:01.229 --> 17:04.149
The truck was full of empty beer bottles.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.277
- Was there ever a trial?
- No.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.905
By the time help got there,
the kids were out of the truck.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.159
They all suffered minor injuries,
and one of them,

17:14.159 --> 17:18.204
he wiped the steering wheel clean.
He said it was to get the blood off,

17:18.204 --> 17:21.082
but they suspected it was
to protect the driver.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.752
- No convictions?
- No. Not even an arrest.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.795
The kids were all pretty wealthy.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.674
The parents hired some good lawyers,
got them off.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.843
The kids all refused to talk.

17:32.761 --> 17:36.473
Here. I got some pictures from the scene.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.896
Hill tried to get justice for five years,
and when he couldn't, he moved to Ottawa.

17:42.896 --> 17:46.983
- He took the job in the records office.
- We have to find those kids.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.528
Yeah, my guess is one of them
is right here in Three Pines.

17:56.659 --> 17:57.744
You okay, Patron?

17:57.744 --> 17:58.870
Hmm? Uh...

17:59.829 --> 18:00.914
Dad!

18:08.630 --> 18:09.964
You sure you're okay?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.883
Hmm. Fine.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.277
<i>You okay?</i>

18:32.737 --> 18:33.780
Yes, honey.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.742
I just wanted to hear your voice.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.494
<i>Oh...</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:42.580
I was thinking of coming home
this evening.

18:42.997 --> 18:47.293
But I have that lecture in Toronto.
I'm driving down there now.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.171
It's six and a half hours.
Why don't you fly?

18:50.171 --> 18:53.883
- No. You know I love to drive.
- I don't want you to drive.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.720
I'm sorry. Sorry.

18:58.471 --> 19:02.684
I will leave early tomorrow.
I will be back in Montreal for lunch.

19:03.101 --> 19:06.145
Well, I was thinking we could
take some time off...

19:06.145 --> 19:08.815
go somewhere. Where would you like to go?

19:08.940 --> 19:11.276
<i>Hmm. Central Italy?</i>

19:11.943 --> 19:17.615
Some small, medieval, mountain village.
We can plan this tomorrow over lunch.

19:18.867 --> 19:19.784
It's a date.

19:21.953 --> 19:22.871
Thank you.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.539
<i>For what?</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:26.666
For everything.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.336
<i>I love you, Armand, for ever.</i>

19:30.336 --> 19:31.504
I love you, honey.

19:48.563 --> 19:51.733
<i>We're having a feast for Blue,
celebrating her life.</i>

19:51.941 --> 19:56.029
Too much sadness. It prevents the spirit
from making its journey home.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.906
We have to be mindful of that.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.327
- So what can I do for you, Armand?
- Oh, I, um...

20:04.245 --> 20:06.831
I wanted to bring this back to you.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.421
You keep it. You found her.

20:15.673 --> 20:16.591
Thank you.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.635
You're welcome.

20:20.053 --> 20:23.556
- I think I see her sometimes.
- Yeah, me too.

20:25.391 --> 20:29.312
Since you found her, we all feel her.
She visits us all the time.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.731
I wish I could find them all.

20:32.357 --> 20:35.818
You can do so much more
than just find our missing girls.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.446
A person in your position,
with your power,

20:38.446 --> 20:42.659
you can make society safer so they don't
go missing in the first place.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.078
Please, don't just wish, Armand.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.496
Not when you can do.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.749
I will.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.126
You're right.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.087
I will.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.424
Why don't you stay?

20:59.217 --> 21:00.760
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.096
Let me introduce you to the community.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.307
So this is our elder, Elsie.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.121
You haven't read it yet.

21:30.832 --> 21:31.874
I started it.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.669
No, you've got to get
all the way to the end.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.047
See what happened to that last bystander.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.010
"'I answered straight and I told you true:

21:42.010 --> 21:44.887
"'The scaffold was raised for none,
but you.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.099
"'For who has served me
more faithfully than you

21:48.099 --> 21:50.393
"'with your coward's hope?' Said he.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.104
"'Where are the others
that might have stood side

21:53.104 --> 21:56.441
"'by your side in the common good?'
'Dead,' I whispered

21:56.941 --> 21:59.068
"and amiably, 'Murdered,'

21:59.068 --> 22:01.112
"the Hangman corrected me."

22:02.447 --> 22:05.366
Spoiler. He ends up on the rope, too.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.079
You have something
to tell the cops, Peter?

22:16.669 --> 22:17.712
Thanks.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.782
I saw someone around the time Ellis died.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.037
Came running out the woods like a madman.
I nearly hit him.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.539
Do you know who it was?

23:02.131 --> 23:03.299
What have you got?

23:03.299 --> 23:06.177
Peter puts Gabri in the woods
the night Hill died.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.888
Did you find out where Gabri
went to college?

23:08.888 --> 23:11.933
Same university
as the kids in the truck. Laval.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.852
Maybe he changed
his name from Duval to Dubeau.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.313
We need to see his birth certificate.

23:17.730 --> 23:23.319
I think his plan was to find
the four kids and kill them one by one.

23:23.319 --> 23:27.698
No, not kill. Execute.
He sentenced them to death.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.367
<i>Kill or be killed.</i>

23:29.367 --> 23:32.954
- Some choice those kids had.
<i>- This is great work, Jean-Guy.</i>

23:32.954 --> 23:37.416
Isabelle and I can take it from here.
Why don't you go home, surprise Enid?

23:37.416 --> 23:42.130
Uh, you sure? I mean... No, I can stay.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.091
<i>- I said go home...</i>
- Yeah, I know. She won't mind.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.635
<i>Go home, Jean-Guy. It's an order.</i>

23:49.929 --> 23:52.014
- Yeah, okay.
<i>- Good.</i>

24:01.899 --> 24:02.984
I'll have a beer.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.866
Did you hear Internal Affairs are in?

24:09.866 --> 24:10.950
Must be something big.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.328
Big's the word.
It's the Blue Two-Rivers case.

24:14.328 --> 24:18.624
The native girl they found buried with
her boyfriend over in Pine Ridge.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.626
Why are they interested in that?

24:20.626 --> 24:23.754
Apparently, there's been
some kind of cover-up.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.465
A senior officer
making evidence disappear.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.718
They're planning to arrest him today.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.179
Pierre Arnot? It's his case, right?

24:31.179 --> 24:35.099
Might be his case, but he's not the one
making bullets disappear.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.060
So who is it? Who are they arresting?

24:38.060 --> 24:40.605
Chief Inspector Armand Gamache.

25:05.588 --> 25:08.090
Olivier?
Can you spare me a minute?

25:08.507 --> 25:11.135
A minute, sure.
We don't want everyone to starve.

25:13.971 --> 25:18.226
Look, I know your loyalties to Gabri,
but I think you know he's in trouble.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.020
He won't talk to me.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.191
- I don't know how to help him.
- But you know something's wrong.

25:25.650 --> 25:28.402
Look, if you don't tell me...
If you don't tell me

25:28.402 --> 25:31.072
what's going on, I can't help him either.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.784
Hill was in Gabri's office
the day of the murder.

25:34.784 --> 25:37.453
I came back from the market,
found them fighting.

25:37.453 --> 25:38.496
About?

25:38.496 --> 25:41.666
Gabri brushed it off,
but he had something of Hill's.

25:41.666 --> 25:45.127
His wallet. I found it in Gabri's jacket
after the murder.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.837
You put it on the bonfire?

25:47.421 --> 25:49.173
I've known him 15 years.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.549
Gabri's no killer.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.219
We're all killers
if we're pushed hard enough.

25:58.516 --> 26:01.394
A witness puts you running out
of Pine Ridge forest

26:01.394 --> 26:03.854
around the time Hill was murdered.

26:03.854 --> 26:07.191
- I went for a run, big deal.
- Do you know Toby Marsh?

26:07.191 --> 26:11.696
Eliza Green? Cindy Payne? Gabriel Duval?

26:12.321 --> 26:13.447
Yeah, I heard of them.

26:13.447 --> 26:16.701
Everyone at Laval heard about it,
but it's a big university.

26:16.701 --> 26:19.328
What does this have to do with Hill?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.123
It was his family who died in the crash.

26:22.123 --> 26:25.293
He came here looking for someone
who he held responsible.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.877
Did you change your name?

26:26.877 --> 26:29.714
Was it your birth certificate he found?

26:29.714 --> 26:33.134
- No. No, of course not.
- Are you Gabriel Duval?

26:33.134 --> 26:34.510
You got him first.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.679
Maybe it was self-defense.

26:36.679 --> 26:37.638
I would never...

26:37.638 --> 26:38.764
So why were you fighting?

26:39.515 --> 26:41.726
And what was he doing in your office?

26:41.726 --> 26:45.479
Why did he cause a scene
at the bistro the night he died?

26:45.479 --> 26:48.566
- I can't.
- Why did you have his wallet?

26:50.026 --> 26:51.485
He left it in the bistro.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.196
I put it in my pocket
to give it back to him.

26:54.196 --> 26:58.117
But he came in drunk and started shouting.
It slipped my mind.

26:58.117 --> 27:02.288
When I heard he was dead,
I thought it would make me look guilty.

27:02.288 --> 27:06.417
If it wasn't you, Gabri,
you need to tell us who you're protecting.

27:15.468 --> 27:19.889
They said they had to change their names
after they were witnesses in a murder.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.602
That the guy they gave evidence against
might get out of jail

27:24.602 --> 27:27.146
and come looking for them,
that he was dangerous.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.607
I thought Hill was that man, a murderer.

27:29.607 --> 27:34.070
He was going through my employee records.
He told me he knew they were here.

27:35.738 --> 27:39.575
I got a fresh start in Three Pines.
I thought they deserved the same.

27:40.826 --> 27:41.827
And who are they?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.839
Know where I can find the boss?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.008
He's busy.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.886
Olivier, two more beers over here please.

28:02.473 --> 28:03.474
So...

28:06.143 --> 28:07.436
What are we drinking to?

28:09.313 --> 28:10.898
We're not buddies, Agent Nichol.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.778
- Your order.
- Thanks.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.042
I actually need to talk to you.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.753
If you heard a rumour
about someone you cared about,

28:32.753 --> 28:36.132
- would you tell them?
- Wow. Things get round SQ fast.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.676
It's not over. Okay?

28:39.844 --> 28:42.304
Enid's just giving me some space.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.099
Your wife's left you?

28:45.891 --> 28:48.394
Olivier, two shots of vodka.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.353
Coming up.

28:50.604 --> 28:53.607
Why'd you need space?
I thought you guys were solid.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.277
Yeah, so did I.

28:57.278 --> 29:00.406
I asked her, "Is there someone else?"

29:00.823 --> 29:04.452
I asked her
if I was doing something wrong.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.496
She just looks at me like I'm crazy.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.291
Thank you. Here.

29:13.544 --> 29:17.006
I still don't know why she left,
but thing is that when I said,

29:17.006 --> 29:20.926
"Till death do us part," I meant it.
I was convinced that she did, too.

29:20.926 --> 29:24.096
I mean, I never thought that
ten years down the line,

29:24.096 --> 29:28.392
she would just walk out the door
without even giving me an explanation.

29:29.727 --> 29:32.313
Maybe she wasn't ready
to give you one yet.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.863
Hey, I really need to find the boss.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.200
This has been fun. We should do it again.

29:49.705 --> 29:50.873
Fucking Nichol.

30:03.052 --> 30:05.221
The police are talking to Gabri.

30:05.221 --> 30:06.222
We have to go.

30:06.764 --> 30:07.598
What?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.309
I thought we stopped running.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.562
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.234
What if we go to the cops?
He killed Toby and Eliza.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.985
He was gonna kill us too.

30:19.985 --> 30:24.615
You wanna tell them who was driving
the truck that killed Hill's wife and kid?

30:27.952 --> 30:31.914
They find out,
you think you won't serve time for it?

30:34.291 --> 30:35.501
Come on.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.921
Pack your stuff.
We are getting out of here.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.643
They let you go?

30:55.604 --> 30:57.565
Peter said he saw you that night.

30:58.023 --> 30:58.941
In the woods.

31:00.484 --> 31:01.402
Were you there?

31:02.486 --> 31:04.488
He was dead. Nobody could help him.

31:04.488 --> 31:07.741
- You left a man hanging in the woods?
- I was in shock.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.919
I told you my mother was dead.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.089
I didn't tell you how.

31:23.215 --> 31:27.344
My father was very controlling.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.930
Everything had to be just so.

31:31.140 --> 31:34.351
If my mother or I
stepped outside his rules...

31:36.604 --> 31:37.938
he punished us.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.026
My mother couldn't take it anymore.

31:45.195 --> 31:46.905
I was 12 when I found her.

31:48.449 --> 31:49.366
Hanging.

31:52.494 --> 31:53.871
I never forgave him.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.790
I never forgave myself.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.045
- I should have protected her.
- You were just a child.

32:02.880 --> 32:06.008
I wish I'd called the police
the moment I found Hill...

32:06.634 --> 32:09.345
but it was like I was 12 again
and I just panicked.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.263
I should have told you.

32:12.139 --> 32:14.016
I wanted to tell you the next day,

32:14.725 --> 32:18.479
but I was scared you'd think
I was a monster to leave him there.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.733
Do you think I'm a monster?

32:23.859 --> 32:24.777
No.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.656
I think you're just a man.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.328
A man I love
more than anything in the world.

32:40.334 --> 32:42.336
Thank you my love.

32:49.176 --> 32:50.511
- Chief.
- Agent Nichol.

32:50.511 --> 32:51.970
I thought you were at SQ.

32:51.970 --> 32:57.476
I was, but there's something I need
to talk to you about.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.853
- Patron.
- Go on.

33:00.604 --> 33:01.730
These rumours.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.941
- They're not true, are they?
- What rumours?

33:04.608 --> 33:08.946
People are saying that it was you.
That it was you who shot Blue and Tommy.

33:18.706 --> 33:19.998
- Isabelle.
<i>- Patron?</i>

33:19.998 --> 33:23.460
I need you to pick up the suspects.
I'll meet you at the Sûreté.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.338
There's something I need to do first.

33:45.983 --> 33:48.527
- Hey.
- I thought you'd gone home.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.571
Not yet. What's going on?

33:50.571 --> 33:54.199
Patron wants me to bring
the suspects in. You go, I got this.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.952
Mike and Angela? Let's bring them in.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.373
Police. Open up.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.708
Shit!

34:03.709 --> 34:05.586
- Let's go.
- We're busting our way in.

34:05.586 --> 34:06.503
Let's go!

34:07.838 --> 34:08.964
Police, open up.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.677
Shit. I'll get the car.

34:15.804 --> 34:16.972
Police. Stop.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.190
Get in. Quick.

34:46.543 --> 34:47.586
Slow down.

34:48.837 --> 34:52.049
- What are you doing?
- You want to tell the boss we lost them?

34:52.049 --> 34:54.343
I want to live to tuck my kids into bed.

34:54.343 --> 34:57.387
- Slow down.
- And let them go? Fuck no.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.182
Have you been drinking?

35:01.350 --> 35:02.267
Shit.

35:02.267 --> 35:05.062
I had a couple of beers.
Don't worry. I'm fine.

35:05.062 --> 35:08.232
- Just stop the car. Now.
- Just relax. Okay?

35:09.066 --> 35:12.569
- I want out now. Stop the car.
- I'm not letting them go, okay?

35:17.950 --> 35:20.619
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

35:21.286 --> 35:22.788
Stop the fucking car!

35:37.052 --> 35:40.389
- There's nothing anyone can do for them.
- I'm gonna go check.

35:50.691 --> 35:52.192
Hello?

36:11.503 --> 36:12.713
Armand?

36:13.255 --> 36:15.424
- Is Pierre home?
- Isn't he working?

36:15.424 --> 36:19.428
I know he had some stake out, said
he wouldn't be back until the morning.

36:19.428 --> 36:22.264
Right. Sure, I'll catch him at the office.

36:23.307 --> 36:24.892
Say hi to Reine-Marie.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.107
I was in control. I was. Okay?

36:33.066 --> 36:36.403
They took the bend too fast.
It's not my fault. It was raining!

36:36.403 --> 36:39.823
You think a judge'd say that?
We were in pursuit...

36:39.823 --> 36:41.033
Of fucking murderers!

36:41.033 --> 36:44.995
You're over the limit, Jean-Guy!
You shouldn't have been driving!

36:44.995 --> 36:48.832
I wasn't thinking. I'm not drunk.
I swear. I was in control!

36:48.832 --> 36:50.709
I was... I'm sorry!

37:03.138 --> 37:04.139
Please.

37:07.017 --> 37:08.018
Okay.

37:09.519 --> 37:10.854
I was driving.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.815
I was driving and you were shotgun.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.943
You'll call it in.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.695
- We don't have to do that.
- You want to get fired? Go to jail?

37:20.197 --> 37:23.825
- What are you talking about, go to jail?
- Just call it in!

37:23.992 --> 37:28.538
<i>You've reached Isabelle Lacoste.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

37:30.082 --> 37:34.002
Isabelle, I'm driving over
to Pierre Arnot's cabin.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.837
I'll text you the address.

37:35.837 --> 37:38.924
When you have those two in custody,
meet me there.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.133
I'm taking him in.

38:19.506 --> 38:20.590
Pierre?

38:32.102 --> 38:33.020
Pierre?

38:47.284 --> 38:48.201
Jesus.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.143
Pierre?

39:15.062 --> 39:16.730
Is that Kevin's truck?

39:17.647 --> 39:20.984
Yeah. Chowski must've had it
the whole time.

39:21.651 --> 39:22.944
He must've done this.

39:25.781 --> 39:26.740
He killed them.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.534
Both of them. Blue and Tommy.

39:34.915 --> 39:38.126
Kevin's truck was all loaded up
with contraband cigarettes.

39:39.252 --> 39:42.172
We pulled them over for a standard
search and seizure.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.466
Tommy pulled out a gun,

39:44.466 --> 39:47.636
so Chowski reacted.
Just like we were trained to do.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.556
It was a legitimate shooting, Armand.
It was.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.560
What happened to all the bullets?
What did you do with them?

39:58.105 --> 40:00.398
Chowski's got buddies in ballistics.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.567
My bet is he made them disappear,

40:02.567 --> 40:05.570
started these rumours
about them coming from your gun.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.365
Brought the truck up here
to try and implicate me.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.202
Can't you see
he's trying to frame us both?

40:13.578 --> 40:16.957
We can go to Francoeur, can't we?
We can tell him the truth.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.250
Where's Chowski now?

40:20.836 --> 40:23.755
Probably made a run for it
after he torched the truck.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.423
Without his badge?

40:25.423 --> 40:27.300
- What?
- What happened in there?

40:30.470 --> 40:34.141
My God, is that Chowski?
You killed him, didn't you?

40:34.599 --> 40:36.059
No. No, no, no.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.563
He must've known the game was up,

40:39.563 --> 40:41.314
- took his own life...
- Stop.

40:41.314 --> 40:44.776
Stop. Don't keep lying to me.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.320
We've been friends for 40 years.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.740
You're godfather to Annie and Danielle.

40:53.034 --> 40:54.578
We don't lie to each other.

40:57.497 --> 41:01.710
Chowski had this scam running.
I didn't want to get involved. I didn't.

41:04.171 --> 41:05.422
What kind of a scam?

41:07.215 --> 41:10.594
We knew Kevin Kis
had a truckload full of tobacco.

41:10.594 --> 41:15.265
<i>Chowski said let's pull him over,
threaten to take them all in</i>

41:15.849 --> 41:19.186
unless Kis gives us a cut.

41:19.519 --> 41:22.898
- So you were taking kickbacks?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:23.565 --> 41:26.985
Who is going to be the big loser here?
Tax man? Big tobacco?

41:28.528 --> 41:31.865
- Hardly the crime of the century.
- So what went wrong?

41:34.534 --> 41:37.037
If you don't tell me, I can't help you.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.001
Kevin panicked and he ran off.

41:44.336 --> 41:48.840
Blue started filming us
going on about sovereignty and rights

41:48.840 --> 41:51.635
and all that horseshit,
and Chowski just lost it.

41:51.635 --> 41:53.887
He tried to grab the phone from Blue.

41:53.887 --> 41:58.016
Tommy got in the way and he just shot him.
Clean in the stomach.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.769
What's the matter with you?

42:00.769 --> 42:01.895
I panicked.

42:03.855 --> 42:08.485
Blue Two-Rivers could've ended my career.
I didn't have a choice, Armand.

42:11.613 --> 42:12.530
I didn't...

42:16.284 --> 42:17.202
You shot her?

42:19.871 --> 42:20.789
You shot Blue?

42:21.581 --> 42:23.875
- She had the video on her phone.
- Hey!

42:24.626 --> 42:27.462
<i>She was running away.
She would have ruined me.</i>

42:27.921 --> 42:30.632
No, it was you!
It was your scam, wasn't it?

42:30.632 --> 42:32.092
It wasn't Chowski's.

42:37.472 --> 42:39.975
And Estelle? Does she know?

42:44.104 --> 42:45.981
I'm nothing without Estelle.

42:47.399 --> 42:49.693
She's my Reine-Marie.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.282
We can go in together.

42:56.658 --> 42:59.119
- I'll take your statement.
- Yeah, right.

42:59.577 --> 43:03.206
- You can't protect me, Armand.
- You've got years of good service.

43:04.207 --> 43:07.919
- Judge will take that into consideration.
- A judge? A judge?

43:08.795 --> 43:10.380
I'm not going to jail, Armand.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.674
- Pierre, listen to me.
- Listen, I'm not...

43:12.674 --> 43:13.967
Listen to me.

43:14.718 --> 43:15.719
Listen to me.

43:18.930 --> 43:22.934
Sooner or later,
the truth is going to catch up with you.

43:24.519 --> 43:28.982
You might think you made those bullets
and that ballistics report disappear.

43:28.982 --> 43:31.818
But do you really think
that was the only copy?

43:35.488 --> 43:36.906
I have the backup.

43:37.907 --> 43:39.659
Photographs of the bullets.

43:41.161 --> 43:42.162
I can prove it.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.292
I can bury you. Don't make me do that.

43:51.671 --> 43:54.049
There's only one way out of this.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.469
You know it's the right way.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.973
Come on.

44:02.682 --> 44:03.725
Come on.

44:06.102 --> 44:07.020
Let's go.

44:11.358 --> 44:14.903
However much modern medicine
strives to delay death,

44:15.612 --> 44:18.740
it's inevitable, and we can't evade it.

44:19.491 --> 44:25.455
Yet, archaeological evidence suggests
we've always had an innate belief,

44:26.122 --> 44:31.836
or maybe hope, that individual life
doesn't just end when the body dies.

44:35.298 --> 44:38.301
- Do you forgive me?
- Let's put things right first.

44:39.177 --> 44:44.724
In some ancient philosophies
and religions, and in popular culture...

44:49.646 --> 44:53.525
humans are considered to have
a non-physical soul...

44:53.650 --> 44:54.734
Armand.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.821
<i>...which is freed
at the moment of death...</i>

45:00.031 --> 45:02.742
<i>to live again in a new kind of existence.</i>

45:03.493 --> 45:04.577
Please forgive me.

45:05.995 --> 45:09.833
Whether that's in the spirit world or...

45:21.553 --> 45:23.263
I'm sorry. I...

45:33.815 --> 45:34.774
Patron!

45:42.282 --> 45:43.283
Patron!

45:43.491 --> 45:46.828
Dr. Beauvoir,
Gamache was shot.

45:48.788 --> 45:49.873
Hey.

45:50.999 --> 45:51.916
We're leaving.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.716
Stay with us.

46:05.054 --> 46:06.181
I love you.

46:14.063 --> 46:15.315
Stay with us.

46:21.738 --> 46:24.782
Hurry! It's urgent,
send an ambulance.

46:29.746 --> 46:31.247
It's gonna be okay.

46:33.041 --> 46:34.918
It'll be okay.
