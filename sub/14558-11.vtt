00:10.844 --> 00:12.646
(camera whirring)

00:20.754 --> 00:22.323
(camera whirring)

00:24.458 --> 00:26.360
Hello!

00:26.394 --> 00:30.331
It's John.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.167
Are you here?

00:33.201 --> 00:34.702
Hello?

00:34.735 --> 00:36.137
(shutter clicks)

00:43.211 --> 00:44.145
(shutter clicks)

00:46.347 --> 00:48.582
(shower running)

00:48.616 --> 00:49.550
(shutter clicks)

00:56.690 --> 00:58.459
It's John!

00:58.492 --> 00:59.793
Hello.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.363
Do you want some company?

01:12.840 --> 01:13.807
(glass shatters)

01:23.884 --> 01:27.255
Victim is John Santos,
30, recently divorced.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.422
Video store manager.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.590
What do you say, Colby?

01:29.623 --> 01:30.724
Hey, he's in here--

01:30.758 --> 01:32.860
we found a wallet
in his back pocket.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.428
Car was parked
out front.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.164
License said he's
from Riverside.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.798
Brought his
own refreshments.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.867
Even found the receipt for it.
Here you go, Ray.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.902
Thank you. We'll get
that to the lab.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.637
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:43.671 --> 01:45.273
Real estate agent
found the body?

01:45.306 --> 01:46.640
Yeah, same as
all the others.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.642
Agent walks in
with the prospective buyer,

01:48.676 --> 01:50.811
opened up and find
the guy like this.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.513
She's never
seen him before.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.914
No. Must have
taken the key

01:53.947 --> 01:55.249
out of the lock box.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.450
We found the
"for sale" sign

01:56.484 --> 01:57.685
tossed into the bushes.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.553
Well, it's the same story.

01:59.587 --> 02:00.654
Tied up, beaten.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.523
DAVID:
Six weeks,

02:02.556 --> 02:04.392
three victims, all the same M.O.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.327
COLBY:
All in unoccupied

02:06.360 --> 02:07.495
homes for sale.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.231
I mean, there's no doubt we
got a serial killer here.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.768
CHARLIE:
Larry!

02:14.802 --> 02:16.604
Over here, Charles.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.409
What is this?
What are you doing?

02:21.442 --> 02:23.811
Well, I'm preparing
for the event horizon

02:23.844 --> 02:25.813
of a new perspective.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.217
Hmm. Guess that makes two of us.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.486
Look, I know I haven't been

02:32.520 --> 02:34.388
entirely supportive
of your decision

02:34.422 --> 02:38.526
to sit atop a Roman candle
and blast off into the unknown.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.828
Hey, if an apology is coming...

02:42.596 --> 02:45.299
...your launch window
is shrinking fast.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.303
I've done some soul-searching.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.973
I think it's really
great that your dream

02:53.006 --> 02:54.642
- is finally coming true.
- Well...

02:54.675 --> 02:56.410
I'm grateful for that, Charles.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.511
I'm just...

02:57.545 --> 02:59.313
I'm gonna miss you.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.414
Yeah, I know.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.851
Well, it's only
six months and...

03:03.884 --> 03:07.255
though I will be traveling
250 miles above the Earth,

03:07.288 --> 03:09.423
at 18,000 miles per hour,

03:09.457 --> 03:11.225
it's only a
phone call away,

03:11.259 --> 03:12.926
albeit a very
expensive phone call.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.897
Going-away present.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.532
I'd say you shouldn't have,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.634
but given your
recent behavior...

03:20.668 --> 03:21.769
Open it.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.906
This is my T-shirt.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.908
The one I gave to you
for safekeeping.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.377
You're rocketing
into space, Larry.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.411
There's no downside

03:30.444 --> 03:32.413
to packing a lucky shirt.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.983
Charles, I will be okay.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.618
Truly I will.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.421
Well...

03:40.454 --> 03:41.955
Well, I'm headed to the FBI.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.891
I'm gonna go work
on a case for Don.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.728
Wanna join me?

03:48.962 --> 03:50.498
Why not?

03:50.531 --> 03:51.932
Cool.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.035
So we've got three
victims now, all bound,

03:55.068 --> 03:55.836
all beaten to death.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.538
Victim Number Three
is this guy,

03:57.571 --> 03:58.772
Santos, the video manager.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.841
Victim Number One
is Scott Tillman,

04:00.874 --> 04:01.909
40-year-old family man

04:01.942 --> 04:04.645
from Mar Vista, killed six
weeks ago in Westwood.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.647
And Two is Jared Holt. He's 55.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.816
He's a broker,
he lives in Malibu

04:08.849 --> 04:11.319
and he was killed
ten days ago in Glendale.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.453
No apparent link between them.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.789
Except for one thing.
The houses they were found in.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.058
Unoccupied, for sale.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.327
All three houses were listed

04:19.360 --> 04:21.395
with three separate real estate
companies. Charlie, we couldn't

04:21.429 --> 04:22.496
find a connection there.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.065
All right, so what are they
doing at these houses?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.199
Well, they all went willingly.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.469
They drove themselves.
Their cars were found on-site.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.405
Plus, you don't bring beer
to your own funeral.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.073
They're finding the
locations first, and somehow

04:33.106 --> 04:34.808
they're getting these guys
there without a fight.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.810
If I may...

04:36.844 --> 04:38.546
The houses are the key. See,

04:38.579 --> 04:40.414
while they may seem
to be randomly selected,

04:40.448 --> 04:41.949
may even appear to be
different on the surface,

04:41.982 --> 04:43.684
there's very likely

04:43.717 --> 04:45.419
a discernible pattern
here somewhere.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.754
MEGAN:
You thinking, you profile

04:46.787 --> 04:48.088
the houses,
you profile the killer?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.557
CHARLIE:
By using

04:49.590 --> 04:51.425
a multi-attribute
compositional model,

04:51.459 --> 04:54.027
I can analyze houses by
looking at the individual

04:54.061 --> 04:56.430
parts that make up the whole.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.498
And given what we know about

04:57.531 --> 04:59.367
the killer's preferences,
well, then, you know,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.869
I can composite his dream house.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.439
All right. So... compare them
to the other houses for sale.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.040
MEGAN: And generate a list
of locations where

05:07.074 --> 05:08.576
he'll most likely strike again.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.877
DAVID:
Clothes make the man.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.679
Maybe houses make the murderer.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.056
COLBY: This guy has definitely
got his own playbook.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.359
I mean, most serial killers,
they stalk their victims,

05:25.393 --> 05:27.060
or they bring them home
to do the deed.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.429
This guy is doing neither.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.364
He lures his victims
to these houses.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.899
All right, so, I mean, he knows

05:31.932 --> 05:33.967
more than just which ones
are for sale.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.604
Yeah, he knows which
ones are empty and when.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.971
It sounds to me
like we're looking

05:38.005 --> 05:40.374
for a real estate agent,
maybe a contractor.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.075
I wonder how he gets them
into the houses

05:42.109 --> 05:43.611
- to begin with.
- I don't know.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.845
But we checked the bank records

05:44.878 --> 05:46.714
and they showed all three
of these victims

05:46.747 --> 05:49.082
just before the murders
took money out of ATMs.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.551
Maybe he's baiting them--

05:50.584 --> 05:51.552
you know, with drugs.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.586
COLBY:
Yeah, or maybe

05:52.620 --> 05:54.154
something else.
Our second victim,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.023
Jared Holt, he got
busted two years ago

05:56.056 --> 05:57.157
on a solicitation rap

05:57.190 --> 05:58.559
with a prostitute
in Hollywood.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.793
Could be a hustle turned murder.

05:59.827 --> 06:00.961
Okay, so cell phones, e-mails,

06:00.994 --> 06:02.663
and the first guy
had a wife, right?

06:02.696 --> 06:03.897
Yeah, Megan's on all that.

06:03.931 --> 06:04.932
All right.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.473
We were married 16 years.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.042
Wow...

06:15.075 --> 06:17.511
So...

06:17.545 --> 06:19.947
you said on the phone
the FBI...

06:19.980 --> 06:22.483
had some new information?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.419
Thank you.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.057
Yeah. Another man
has been found.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.526
(sighs)

06:32.560 --> 06:33.661
It's...

06:34.862 --> 06:36.964
Tomorrow,

06:36.997 --> 06:38.832
it's six weeks to the day.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.437
It's hardest on the kids.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.206
Tom cries every morning,
wants his daddy.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.008
But Susan's the one

06:48.041 --> 06:49.076
I'm really worried about.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.143
She doesn't cry at all.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.144
I'm really sorry

06:51.178 --> 06:52.746
to put you through this again.

06:52.780 --> 06:57.084
No, it's okay. It's just...

06:57.117 --> 06:59.086
I don't know what
more I can tell you.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.588
Well, we found
some commonalities

07:00.621 --> 07:02.890
between the murders.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.125
- Commonalities?
- Yeah.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.761
Your husband withdrew
some money from an ATM

07:07.795 --> 07:08.829
justo the house.ent

07:08.862 --> 07:09.830
Money?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.031
Yeah. A few hundred dollars.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.833
And you think that
could be significant?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.001
We're not sure, but...

07:14.034 --> 07:15.903
we're not sure why
he was at the house

07:15.936 --> 07:17.838
or what he would have
had the money for.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.741
I told you, we moved
here a year ago, needed

07:20.774 --> 07:23.176
a house fast, bought
this one, sight unseen.

07:23.210 --> 07:26.046
We talked about getting
a bigger place.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.248
Isn't that strange that he would
be there alone, though?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.552
Oh, Scott made most
of our financial decisions,

07:31.585 --> 07:33.854
so if we were getting
a bigger place,

07:33.887 --> 07:34.988
he...

07:35.022 --> 07:38.759
Plus, my birthday was coming up.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.993
If, uh,

07:40.027 --> 07:41.829
I had to guess, I would say

07:41.862 --> 07:44.131
he probably wanted
to surprise me.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.904
Some birthday present, huh?

07:53.541 --> 07:55.676
LARRY:
Imagine a tortured psyche

07:55.709 --> 07:57.811
avenging some childhood slight.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.079
He chooses houses
that remind him

07:59.112 --> 08:00.514
of where he grew up.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.615
Completes the circle.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.617
It's very Hitchcock.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.018
I would say it's very Megan.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.687
You two have been
spending so much

08:06.720 --> 08:08.622
time together, your
minds are melding.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.958
Well, of course we needed
to maximize the hours

08:10.991 --> 08:13.026
given that soon we will be
restricted to more...

08:13.060 --> 08:16.029
oh... creative communication.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.800
So is that part of the creative
communications plan?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.069
Actually, somebody threw
a wrench in the works

08:22.102 --> 08:24.672
in my attempts to secure
the CalSci Celestron,

08:24.705 --> 08:27.040
but Megan and I
have now devised

08:27.074 --> 08:27.908
a new arrangement.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.010
I will be able
to look down at her...

08:30.043 --> 08:31.879
as she is able
to look up at me.

08:32.946 --> 08:33.914
(laser blipping)

08:33.947 --> 08:35.182
Ooh.

08:38.118 --> 08:38.485
Is that your...?

08:39.953 --> 08:40.721
Wait a second.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.055
You have a cell
phone? Since when

08:42.089 --> 08:43.190
do you have one of those?

08:43.223 --> 08:45.626
Since NASA started calling me.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.895
I'm sorry. This is

08:47.928 --> 08:49.229
LCan I help you?.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.163
You know what?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.933
His theory about the
killer's childhood?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.935
- Yeah.
- It's making me think we should

08:54.968 --> 08:56.069
re-weight these
variables, you know?

08:56.103 --> 08:57.204
Okay.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.706
CHARLIE:
So why don't we start...?

09:01.341 --> 09:02.976
What's up?

09:03.010 --> 09:06.313
Well, my journey may have ended
before it even began.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.148
What happened?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.818
Just... the mission.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.152
What, was it scratched?

09:12.185 --> 09:13.153
No.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.055
Apparently, I was.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.926
DAVID: You going through
victim backgrounds?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.161
Yes. I have
medical history,

09:21.194 --> 09:23.230
and family histories
and education.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.698
anything in common?

09:24.732 --> 09:25.699
I don't know yet.

09:25.733 --> 09:26.734
Maybe.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.901
John Santos,
that last victim,

09:27.935 --> 09:31.371
he has a sealed record with
Child and Family Services.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.774
He went through all kinds
of foster care growing up.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.742
So?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.376
So, Jared Holt,

09:36.409 --> 09:37.945
that second victim,
has a solicitation rap.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.913
I'm not sure I follow.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.982
You know, the rage,
the violence.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.084
It all has a sort of
sexual component to it,

09:44.117 --> 09:46.787
but, you know, I'm not
putting this out there

09:46.820 --> 09:48.856
till I finish my homework.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.127
(sighs)

09:54.161 --> 09:55.863
Does it look bad?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.865
- I-I don't know, but...
- Of course not.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.366
We'll find out in a second.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.036
What's the story?

10:03.070 --> 10:06.874
According to Millie,
some unnamed rival

10:06.907 --> 10:10.010
of Larry's in some
unnamed institute

10:10.043 --> 10:10.944
in Massachusetts

10:10.978 --> 10:13.714
lobbied for an 11th-hour
background check.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.049
It seems that some
of Larry's recent...

10:16.083 --> 10:18.686
lifestyle choices
have become a subject

10:18.719 --> 10:20.087
of concern of NASA.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.288
They...

10:21.321 --> 10:23.924
They found out he was living
in the steam tunnels, right?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.258
AMITA:
How could they? I mean,

10:25.292 --> 10:27.094
we're his friends and we
didn't even know until...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.129
Mildred. And just when I was
beginning to think

10:29.162 --> 10:30.263
she was a living,
breathing

10:30.297 --> 10:31.231
- human being.
ALAN: Come on.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.099
Come on, Charlie.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.701
How could you
blame Millie for this?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.068
How can I blame her?
How can you defend her?

10:35.102 --> 10:37.070
NASA called her.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.972
It wasn't the
other way around.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.440
Mildred is department
chair, Charlie.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.009
I mean, if NASA pressed her

10:42.042 --> 10:43.911
for a full disclosure,
she couldn't lie.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.445
She felt horrible
about this whole thing.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.748
I-I did, too.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.751
What's all this about?

10:50.784 --> 10:52.219
It's real estate data.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.055
We're trying to quantify
a serial killer's

10:55.088 --> 10:57.290
emotional attachment to the
houses he commits murders in.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.126
Mmm. Well,

10:59.159 --> 11:00.828
killer or home-buyer,

11:00.861 --> 11:02.395
the rule is always
the same, isn't it?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.064
Location, location, location.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.103
He's right.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.072
We've been looking
at the houses.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.808
We should be looking
at the neighborhoods.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.810
I checked the victims' phone
logs and their credit cards.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.145
They didn't go
to the same places,

11:18.178 --> 11:19.747
they didn't talk
to the same people.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.848
E-mail?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.449
Colby's checking their
Internet service providers,

11:22.482 --> 11:24.251
but so far, it's not
looking so good.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.719
All right, so we're back
to square one.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.820
Maybe not completely.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.121
Why, what do you got?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.990
I called Child
and Family Services

11:30.023 --> 11:33.326
about victim number three--
John Santos.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.728
sealed juvie record.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.796
Yeah.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.831
At seven years old
he was removed from his home.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.967
Suspicion that he was being
sexually molested.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.334
Well, you
know, this is

11:41.368 --> 11:42.936
giving. Those victims...

11:42.970 --> 11:43.871
DON: Right.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.438
A lot of them
become abusers themselves.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.807
Yeah, so that
inspired me

11:46.840 --> 11:47.841
to take a fresh look

11:47.875 --> 11:48.909
at all of our victims.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.477
And number two, Jared Holt--

11:50.510 --> 11:52.212
he's the one that had
the solicitation rap--

11:52.245 --> 11:54.247
what we didn't know
was that the prostitute

11:54.281 --> 11:55.949
was underage.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.284
She was 14 years old.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.519
His lawyer had the rape charge
dismissed.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.488
And what about victim number
one, the teacher?

12:01.521 --> 12:03.891
His wife told me
they moved. Turns out

12:03.924 --> 12:05.125
they moved a lot.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.127
Five schools in seven years.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.930
I called the administrators,
nobody had any comment.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.965
Well, that definitely
tells us something.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.134
Tells us we've got a guy
soliciting underage prostitutes,

12:14.167 --> 12:15.235
a teacher messing with kids

12:15.268 --> 12:16.369
and a victim

12:16.403 --> 12:19.472
of sexual abuse who more than
likely may have become

12:19.506 --> 12:21.041
an abuser himself.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.043
COLBY: Just got off the phone
with the victim's ISPs.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.012
They didn't have anything
in e-mails,

12:25.045 --> 12:27.280
but they did have records
of visits to chat rooms.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.983
Dozens of sites with names
like "Lonely Girls Only,"

12:30.017 --> 12:32.119
"Cheerleader Diaries."

12:32.152 --> 12:33.921
Got tons more
if you want 'em.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.389
Maybe they decided to take it
a step further than just talk.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.992
Maybe that's why
they're dead.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.232
Hey, good morning.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.001
All right, so...
he's going after sex offenders.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.370
Yeah, and combined with
the brutality of the murders,

12:50.403 --> 12:51.504
it really suggests
one motive.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.840
Right, revenge.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.842
Yeah, something happened
in the past

12:54.875 --> 12:56.143
and the killer's getting
payback now.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.377
He's likely a victim
of abuse.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.947
MEGAN:
Yeah, or someone close to him.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.014
A daughter, sister.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.083
And what, the common
denominator's the Internet?

13:03.116 --> 13:03.817
MEGAN: Yeah, he's luring

13:03.851 --> 13:05.052
them in
through the chat rooms.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.854
All right, why don't you get
after those transcripts, huh?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.188
- We're on it.
- So if the killer's

13:08.221 --> 13:09.222
meeting his victims online,

13:09.256 --> 13:10.924
there's got to be
an electronic trail, right?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.993
Yeah, I mean, if we find
the common user

13:13.026 --> 13:15.362
name that these people talk to,
I think we've found the killer.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.530
Good.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.933
Sorry for the mess.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.302
I just got the kids
off to school.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.537
Your Internet service provider
gave me a list of chat rooms

13:24.571 --> 13:26.073
your husband
visited.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.374
Huh?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.375
They seem more appropriate

13:28.408 --> 13:31.244
for a 14-year-old girl
than a 40-year-old man.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.180
We know why

13:33.213 --> 13:34.481
your husband was at that house.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.016
I think you do, too,
Mrs. Tillman.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.285
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.154
All those schools

13:41.188 --> 13:43.023
in all those cities?

13:43.056 --> 13:44.324
You have children.
How can you

13:44.357 --> 13:45.558
continue to protect him?

13:45.592 --> 13:49.429
My husband and I were married
for 16 years.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.563
I have a family.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.165
You think I could just

13:52.199 --> 13:54.301
throw it all away?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.869
We tried counseling.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.905
He promised he'd stop.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.139
But he didn't, did he?

14:01.408 --> 14:05.278
He told me, he swore to me...

14:07.214 --> 14:08.448
...he'd never touch the kids.

14:08.481 --> 14:12.252
Your husband went on a chat room
and met someone

14:12.285 --> 14:14.554
that he thought was
a very young girl.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.656
Someone else's kid.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.193
And he went to that
house to meet her.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.162
Now if you saw a name...

14:22.195 --> 14:24.597
if you saw an I.M.
on his computer...

14:24.631 --> 14:26.166
You protected him

14:26.199 --> 14:28.335
for a really long time and look
where it's gotten you.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.337
If you keep living
in this denial,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.205
you're just going
to protect his killer.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.008
We are done here.
Thank you.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.348
AMITA:
You haven't said

14:41.381 --> 14:42.950
one word in ten minutes.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.952
Just thinking.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.587
Look, I think by now
I can distinguish

14:47.620 --> 14:49.622
between Professor Eppes

14:49.656 --> 14:52.025
puzzling over a math problem
and Charlie Eppes

14:52.059 --> 14:53.526
worrying about a friend.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.494
It's not Larry.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.097
It's me.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.366
To think I was glad that

14:59.399 --> 15:02.369
my best friend's dream
had been destroyed.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.371
(laughs)

15:04.404 --> 15:05.973
What's that say about me?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.640
That you're human.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.642
That you care about Larry.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.079
I think when it
comes to emotions,

15:12.112 --> 15:14.681
Professor Eppes has to cut
Charlie Eppes

15:14.714 --> 15:16.083
a little bit of slack.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.086
The good news is

15:19.119 --> 15:20.587
I have been working.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.122
The current thinking is

15:22.155 --> 15:24.124
our killer was targeting
sex offenders.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.225
young teens, right?

15:25.258 --> 15:25.758
Right.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.527
Which is why I reset

15:27.560 --> 15:29.496
the parameters of our
neighborhood analysis

15:29.529 --> 15:31.531
to reflect the interests
of teenagers.

15:31.564 --> 15:35.502
All three houses are located
near schools, movie theaters

15:35.535 --> 15:36.536
and shopping malls.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.670
Places were kids go?

15:37.704 --> 15:38.972
(whispers):
Right.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.077
(piano jazz playing)

15:44.111 --> 15:46.513
NASA hasn't made any
decisions yet, Larry.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.714
Don't give up yet.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.317
Oh, what was I thinking?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.185
That I had the right stuff?

15:52.219 --> 15:54.287
Larry Fleinhardt,
steam tunnel freak.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.323
Oh, come on, you're not a freak.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.424
You are an eccentric.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.692
A delightful,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.562
charming, sexy eccentric.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.564
But you are not a freak.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.700
You know why I bought
that car, don't you?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.436
The '31 Ford.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.039
I remember something about
the organization

16:12.072 --> 16:14.041
and the art deco lines.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.576
All true, but the
tipping point--

16:16.609 --> 16:19.446
what made me take
the pecuniary plunge--

16:19.479 --> 16:21.581
was actually the hood ornament.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.216
That's right.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.684
It was a bird in flight.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.187
Now a day ago,
I was that bird.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.422
Now...

16:30.757 --> 16:32.692
Now my wings have been clipped.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.601
COLBY:
Don, I think we got something.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.769
Found a bunch of chat rooms

16:42.802 --> 16:44.204
that each of the three
victims visited.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.605
Now on the day
that they were murdered

16:45.638 --> 16:46.673
each of them had chatted

16:46.706 --> 16:50.310
with the same person--
a user named cheerchik15.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.045
The transcripts indicate
our killer pretended

16:52.079 --> 16:53.480
to be a 15-year-old girl.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.614
Okay, well, trace it.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.415
Well, he was smart.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.484
He used Internet cafes,
paid cash,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.152
made sure there were no cameras.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.153
So what, dead end?

17:00.187 --> 17:01.221
Except we had our techs check

17:01.254 --> 17:02.355
the visitor logs
of those chat rooms

17:02.389 --> 17:03.756
going all the way
back to the fall.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.458
What, this cheerchik
appear before?

17:05.492 --> 17:07.827
Yeah, three months ago.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.263
And he just finds
them again online?

17:10.297 --> 17:11.364
How do you explain that?

17:11.398 --> 17:12.299
Well, we can't exactly,

17:12.332 --> 17:14.101
but at least we have
somebody to ask now.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.303
The guy slipped up
and used his home computer.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.206
I.P. address traces back
to a Brendan McCrary.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.207
All right, and?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.208
He fits the profile.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.142
He had a daughter

17:22.175 --> 17:23.710
who was victimized
by an online predator.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.378
She committed suicide
a year ago.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.447
Wife works for a mortgage
company.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.848
COLBY:
So he had access to all

17:28.881 --> 17:29.682
the real estate information
he needed.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.451
All right, go for it.
Pick him up,

17:31.484 --> 17:33.386
let's see what we get.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.721
MAN:
All right, defense! Move back!

17:34.754 --> 17:36.289
BOY:
Open!

17:36.323 --> 17:37.424
MAN:
Move it up!

17:37.457 --> 17:39.159
(indistinct shouting)

17:39.192 --> 17:40.660
(whistle blows)

17:40.693 --> 17:42.229
(players cheering)

17:42.262 --> 17:43.630
BOY:
Hey. Dad...

17:43.663 --> 17:44.631
See that?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.799
Oh, yeah. Good, son.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.201
some answers...

17:48.235 --> 17:49.502
Brendan McCrary.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.404
- I got to go.
- FBI.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.373
- We need to talk to you.
- About what?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.807
Your exploits
on the Internet.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.544
Cheerchik15--
ring a bell?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.379
Turn it around, put your hands
behind your back.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.814
Wait, wait, wait, this is nuts.
Guys, we're on the same side.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.150
The same side?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.417
I can explain it.
You just need to...

18:04.451 --> 18:06.419
Sir, you don't want
to do this here.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.520
(man shouting
indistinctly)

18:09.322 --> 18:10.823
BRENDAN:
Hey, call your mother.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.725
I need the lawyer.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.266
(whistle blowing)
MAN: Let's go, come on!

18:24.871 --> 18:26.406
Tell me something, Mr. McCrary,

18:26.439 --> 18:29.276
you are cheerchik15?

18:29.309 --> 18:30.543
It's a user name I go by.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.578
Pretending to be

18:31.611 --> 18:33.346
a 15-year-old
girl wanting sex.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.548
Excuse me, but what is it you
think my client has done here?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.417
Hold on a second,
Counselor.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.719
This is Scott Tillman,
Jared Holt

18:39.752 --> 18:41.688
and this is John Santos.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.458
They're all dead-- they all
communicated with cheerchik15.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.693
- What?!
- Yeah, that's right,

18:46.726 --> 18:48.361
they were given an address

18:48.395 --> 18:49.829
they were murdered.

18:49.862 --> 18:50.763
I...

18:50.797 --> 18:53.400
This is a chat with Santos.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.168
Santos: "What are
you wearing?"

18:55.202 --> 18:56.236
Cheerchik15:

18:56.269 --> 18:58.471
"Wouldn't you
like to know? LOL."

18:58.505 --> 18:59.639
That's enough, Mr. Eppes...

18:59.672 --> 19:00.373
Santos-- hold on--
"Can I come over?"

19:00.407 --> 19:01.374
Cheerchik15:

19:01.408 --> 19:02.509
"Parents are away for weekend.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.411
I'll get pretty for you."

19:04.444 --> 19:05.912
- Santos: "I'll be there."
- Yeah, yeah.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.347
Thbut it's not me.e,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.448
Right.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.649
You going to tell me
it wasn't you three months ago?

19:09.682 --> 19:10.883
- Huh?
- God, you don't know

19:10.917 --> 19:12.352
what this is about, do you?

19:12.385 --> 19:13.853
No, I get it. I understand--
it's payback for

19:13.886 --> 19:15.455
what happened with your
daughter, isn't that it?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.656
- My daughter?
- I mean, it makes sense.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.391
I think mistake... serious

19:18.425 --> 19:19.392
BRENDAN: My daughter...

19:19.426 --> 19:20.327
Wait, no, because you couldn't
protect her...

19:20.360 --> 19:21.761
You're the ones
who couldn't protect her!

19:21.794 --> 19:22.695
What?

19:22.729 --> 19:23.763
The guy who lured her
out was on parole.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.799
I belong to a group called
Parents Stop Predators.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.536
We go online to chat rooms,
we pretend to be teens

19:29.569 --> 19:31.404
and we have
these creeps arrested.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.240
Say what?

19:33.273 --> 19:35.242
Maybe someone hijacked
my user name from the group.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.910
I don't know, but whoever killed
these men it wasn't me.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.581
Brendan?

19:41.614 --> 19:42.815
Are you all right?

19:42.849 --> 19:43.816
Everything's okay.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.017
I just saw the lawyer.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.919
He said that the FBI was talking
to you about some murders?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.721
It turns out it was
all a big mistake.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.257
MRS. McCRARY: A mistake?
- Yeah.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.123
Come on.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.426
You people are always
making mistakes.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.961
I'm sorry, ma'am.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.763
were doing your job...

19:56.796 --> 19:57.830
Let's go.

19:57.864 --> 19:58.998
my daughter would
still be alive.

19:59.031 --> 19:59.866
Let's go.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.606
Not sure this is going
to brighten the mood any.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.608
- Well?
- His story checks out.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.577
Local P.D. confirmed
that three months ago

20:10.610 --> 20:12.679
he attempted to lure
the victims to a house.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.548
They didn't bite, so he
sent a letter instead.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.716
Saying?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.751
Notification
they'd attempted

20:18.785 --> 20:21.020
explicit sexual conversations
with a minor.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.589
Threatened to out them

20:22.622 --> 20:25.692
to their families if they didn't
seek counseling. Oh...

20:25.725 --> 20:27.594
and he has an alibi
to the last murder.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.362
CHARLIE:
Don.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.863
What, you got something?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.465
Yeah, I think we figured out

20:32.499 --> 20:34.467
why the killer's
picking these houses.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.702
Amita's got the laptop.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.304
So...

20:37.337 --> 20:38.971
we hit a wall trying
to composite

20:39.005 --> 20:40.440
our killer's ideal house

20:40.473 --> 20:42.875
because we realized
he's not choosing houses.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.043
He's choosing
by neighborhoods.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.379
CHARLIE: Exactly. We're all
familiar with Megan's Law.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.780
Yeah, requires the police
to tell the public

20:47.814 --> 20:49.048
about sex offenders.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.883
There's also something
called Jessica's Law.

20:50.917 --> 20:51.984
Right. Where they can't live.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.020
Not 2,000 feet from a school,
or day care, right?

20:54.053 --> 20:56.389
So what we did was
we ran an analysis

20:56.423 --> 20:57.890
of Jessica's Laws hot zones

20:57.924 --> 21:01.027
and mapped it against the
locations of the three houses.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.863
MEGAN: The houses where the
murders occurred are all

21:03.896 --> 21:04.731
dead center?

21:04.764 --> 21:05.598
DON:
Right. So these

21:05.632 --> 21:07.634
are the areas
we're supposed to look?

21:07.667 --> 21:10.603
And I also mapped all the other
Jessica's Law hot zones

21:10.637 --> 21:12.505
in the entire L.A. area.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.606
Oh, boy.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.074
Come on, Charlie, what, are you
kidding me? I mean,

21:15.107 --> 21:16.643
there's no way we can cover
this much ground.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.345
MEGAN:
Wait a minute. That might be

21:18.378 --> 21:19.312
the killer's message.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.881
That there's no way
we can stop these guys.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.416
What? Only he can?

21:25.418 --> 21:26.786
DAVID:
A Web host

21:26.819 --> 21:27.787
monitoring
one of their sites

21:27.820 --> 21:29.389
just gave us a call.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.057
Our killer posted a video.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.625
Don, you have
to see this.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.031
I didn't do anything.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.934
I just came by
to see a friend.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.936
(panting)

21:43.970 --> 21:46.673
My name is John Santos...

21:46.706 --> 21:50.777
I came to this house to have sex
with a 15-year-old girl.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.412
This isn't the first time.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.581
DAVID: He beats them
until they confess.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.549
I've had relations
with over 30 girls

21:56.583 --> 21:59.352
under the age of 15.

21:59.386 --> 22:02.555
I ask for forgiveness
from them...

22:02.589 --> 22:03.756
from their families...

22:04.991 --> 22:06.526
You don't want to see the rest.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.695
Killer uploaded this video

22:08.728 --> 22:12.131
to a site that holds suicides,
beheadings, you name it.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.566
- Post today?
- Yeah, this morning.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.568
I did a search and found
a similar video

22:15.602 --> 22:16.403
of victim number two

22:16.436 --> 22:18.104
put up two days
after he was killed.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.706
What about the first victim?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.140
Nothing yet.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.742
All right, well,
can you trace him?

22:22.775 --> 22:24.010
Techs have been trying,

22:24.043 --> 22:26.846
but the killer must have used
some kind of masking program.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.448
They haven't been able
to crack it.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.583
All right, well, who
are you going to call?

22:30.617 --> 22:31.818
- Charlie.
- There you go.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.887
(phone beeps)

22:34.921 --> 22:36.689
(speed dial tone)

22:42.762 --> 22:45.432
Yeah, so it seems to me

22:45.465 --> 22:46.566
that the killer is using

22:46.599 --> 22:48.501
some kind of "onion-routing"
technique.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.570
Onion-routing

22:50.603 --> 22:53.139
is a way of sending
content over a network

22:53.172 --> 22:55.475
and still remaining
completely anonymous.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.510
It's sort of like a person

22:57.544 --> 23:00.513
sending a series of letters
inside letters.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.114
He sends the first one
to a friend,

23:02.148 --> 23:04.484
who then finds a second letter
inside,

23:04.517 --> 23:05.752
and all that friend knows is,

23:05.785 --> 23:07.987
he's supposed to forward
that letter, so he does.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.758
So, each letter is like a layer
of an onion being peeled back

23:11.791 --> 23:14.727
until the final message inside
is revealed.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.497
Can you crack
something like this?

23:17.530 --> 23:19.799
You know, it's funny,
I created an algorithm

23:19.832 --> 23:21.534
for one of Larry's projects,

23:21.568 --> 23:24.637
and so I-I think I can
adapt it to this case.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.639
And speaking of Larry,
Charlie, I...

23:26.673 --> 23:28.007
I keep thinking
that maybe

23:28.040 --> 23:30.643
there's something
that-that we can do to help him.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.712
I keep thinking the same thing,
but I-I don't know what.

23:32.745 --> 23:33.913
What about all the people
you know

23:33.946 --> 23:36.516
in the science community?
What if you call one of them?

23:36.549 --> 23:37.717
(sighs)

23:37.750 --> 23:40.520
Well, Larry's NoiseTamper
project is an NSA initiative,

23:40.553 --> 23:41.854
but you have to understand,

23:41.888 --> 23:44.056
if NASA's questioning
Larry's overall fitness,

23:44.090 --> 23:46.058
- that's...
- Then we should make that call,

23:46.092 --> 23:48.628
because Larry
is devastated.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.930
His spirit
is-is crushed.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.733
He's like a star collapsing in
on himself.

23:57.003 --> 24:00.239
You two have been
hanging out a lot.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.241
Charlie, I don't want him
to go either.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.076
If there's
anything we can do,

24:04.110 --> 24:07.046
we have to let Larry be Larry.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.250
The killer's timeline
is definitely accelerating.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.853
He's gone from six weeks
between kills to ten days;

24:13.886 --> 24:15.522
now down to 72 hours.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.557
What's the deal, is Charlie's
thing up and running?

24:17.590 --> 24:20.092
Megan says it'll be up in an
hour, but there's a problem.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.628
What's that?

24:21.661 --> 24:24.631
It can't run a trace
after an upload's completed.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.733
It can only look for content
during transmission.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.836
Great, so what do we do, wait
till the guy does it again?

24:29.869 --> 24:31.671
This better work.
(typing)

24:33.640 --> 24:35.875
CHARLIE:
Hey, so I got the algorithm

24:35.908 --> 24:38.144
set to scan the site
the killer's been uploading to.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.880
Once we get a hit, we'll be able
to trace his transmission.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.114
All right, good.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.018
(beeping)
We got a hit, Professor.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.655
Okay. Hey.
Don, hey! We got a hit.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.260
My name is Wendell Henderson.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.262
I came to this house

24:56.295 --> 24:59.131
to have sex
with a 15-year-old girl.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.769
In the past ten years, I've...

25:02.802 --> 25:05.104
molested over 40 young girls.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.873
- Some as young as 11...
- All right, so?

25:06.906 --> 25:08.274
It's getting there.
Just another minute.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.208
I understand

25:09.241 --> 25:12.111
that I can
never give these young girls...

25:12.144 --> 25:13.746
Wow, this is really odd.

25:13.780 --> 25:14.781
What?

25:14.814 --> 25:15.782
This transmission--

25:15.815 --> 25:17.917
the file size and video times

25:17.950 --> 25:19.318
are steadily increasing, and

25:19.351 --> 25:21.754
the checksums
are constantly changing.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.656
This is uploading live.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.857
- Wait, what?
- Don...

25:24.891 --> 25:25.825
...their trust...

25:25.858 --> 25:27.259
- He hasn't killed him yet.
- Tina, come on.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.228
Youlocation now.e a

25:29.261 --> 25:30.029
I'm tapping
into the server. I should

25:30.062 --> 25:31.163
be able to run a
ping trace to find

25:31.197 --> 25:34.133
- the broadcast socket.
- Do that. Call me in the car.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.669
HENDERSON: I ask forgiveness...
from these young girls...

25:36.703 --> 25:37.604
Got it.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.305
- ...and their parents...
- 252 Estrella.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.908
...for the pain and suffering
that I've caused...

25:41.941 --> 25:43.275
(sirens wailing)

25:46.345 --> 25:48.781
Jimmy, you guys come with me.
Colby, David,

25:48.815 --> 25:49.949
take two and head out back.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.925
FBI! FBI! FBI!

25:58.958 --> 26:00.326
- FBI! FBI!
- What is this?!

26:00.359 --> 26:01.861
Wait here! Don't move!

26:01.894 --> 26:03.095
- What's happening?
- You alone in

26:03.129 --> 26:04.931
the house?
- Yes, I don't understand.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.633
All riit's okay.ight,

26:06.666 --> 26:07.066
You been on the Internet?

26:07.099 --> 26:08.267
Ndown today.n

26:08.300 --> 26:09.201
Okay, it's okay.
Just relax.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.637
We're sorry, it's
the wrong house, ma'am.

26:10.670 --> 26:11.704
We're going to rectify this.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.705
The khis tracks.ering

26:12.739 --> 26:13.606
(dialing phone)

26:13.640 --> 26:14.807
He must have
piggybacked their router.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.677
I'm sorry, ma'am. Sorry.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.311
Hey, Charlie, we got
a problem here.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.212
(muffled scream)

26:20.246 --> 26:23.315
Yeah, Don, what's going on?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.184
We... we just lost
our video transmission.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.753
DON:
It's the wrong house.

26:26.786 --> 26:27.820
He must have
piggybacked the signal.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.689
Oh, no, that's not possible.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.390
You know what, if he did,

26:31.423 --> 26:34.160
then he's in the area
using a WIFI signal.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.230
Tell me all the houses for sale
in the neighborhood.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.632
I'm already on it.

26:39.666 --> 26:42.635
Okay, I've got a house.

26:42.669 --> 26:43.770
It's two streets over.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.839
It's 2463
North Irving Boulevard.

26:46.873 --> 26:50.843
DISPATCH: All units...
2463 North Irving Boulevard,

26:50.877 --> 26:53.680
stand by for possible backup...

26:53.713 --> 26:54.881
Oh, damn.

26:54.914 --> 26:55.848
Damn!

27:00.119 --> 27:01.087
Ah, he's dead.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.221
He must have heard
the chopper.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.389
Left in a hurry.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.824
Ah, he left this--

27:04.857 --> 27:06.092
computer transmitting gear.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.794
We were close.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.262
Yeah, well. You guys clear?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.230
AGENT:
All clear.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.773
Wendell Henderson.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.942
32, computer geek.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.378
Same story. He talked dirty with
Brendan McCrary in a chatroom

27:26.412 --> 27:27.780
three months ago.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.281
And the killer
contacts him again,

27:29.315 --> 27:30.883
using McCrary's
username to lure him.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.752
DAVID:
Electronic gear we found

27:32.785 --> 27:33.886
was all bought with cash.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.155
The store owners can't remember
who made the purchases.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.758
I mean, so whoever it is clearly
has access

27:38.791 --> 27:39.558
to McCrary's files.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.626
COLBY: He may be right.
It may be

27:40.659 --> 27:43.129
somebody from his group
who hijacked his username.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.130
DAVID:
I have a list

27:44.163 --> 27:46.733
of all the Parents
Stop Predator volunteers,

27:46.766 --> 27:48.300
transcripts of their chatroom
conversations.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.469
Well, then may I take
a look at that?

27:50.502 --> 27:53.039
A lot of names to go through,
Charlie.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.085
Maybe instead of going
through the names,

28:06.118 --> 28:08.120
why don't we go
through the chat?

28:08.154 --> 28:08.955
What do you mean?

28:08.988 --> 28:10.422
Well, it's just like
any language.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.924
You know, on-line messaging

28:11.958 --> 28:13.492
has its own vocabulary
and syntax.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.961
Senders of these messages

28:14.994 --> 28:16.395
develop their own unique
patterns of speech,

28:16.428 --> 28:17.730
which can then be analyzed

28:17.764 --> 28:19.999
using Statistical
Linguistic Analysis.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.268
It's like a jeweler
beading a necklace.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.804
A jeweler chooses certain
types of beads

28:24.837 --> 28:26.338
then strings them
in a particular pattern

28:26.372 --> 28:28.340
according to his own unique,
personal style,

28:28.374 --> 28:31.477
just like IM senders
will exhibit their own styles,

28:31.510 --> 28:33.880
patterns of speech
which are unique to them.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.915
So, then we just compare them.

28:35.948 --> 28:38.951
Yeah, to the transcripts
of the volunteers

28:38.985 --> 28:41.120
for this "Parents Stop
Predators" group.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.822
Look, if the killer
is in that group,

28:42.855 --> 28:44.523
he will be betrayed

28:44.556 --> 28:46.392
by his own chat.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.928
Amita.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.797
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.198
Um, have you seen Charlie?

28:52.231 --> 28:55.234
I-I have the transcripts
from the killer's latest chat.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.869
He's working in
Larry's office.

28:56.903 --> 28:57.937
Larry's at a symposium.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.806
And he thought he could
concentrate better there.

28:59.839 --> 29:02.074
Oh, he's got you working
on this, too?

29:02.108 --> 29:04.543
Well, my experience with
asymptotic combinatorics

29:04.576 --> 29:05.812
comes in handy.

29:05.845 --> 29:09.048
Sounds like everything you need
for a good working relationship.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.917
Charlie and I
work well together.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.251
That must be nice.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.120
You gonna miss him, aren't you?

29:14.153 --> 29:16.388
Yeah, a little more
than I think I originally

29:16.422 --> 29:17.990
thought I would.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.258
Well, he's coming back.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.259
Yeah, he is.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.895
And I have a telescope now.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.030
(laughs)

29:24.063 --> 29:25.798
You know, I'm actually
going that way.

29:25.832 --> 29:26.665
I'll walk with you.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.434
- (laughing): Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.838
CHARLIE:
I need to speak with Dr. York

29:31.871 --> 29:33.973
concerning Lawrence Fleinhardt.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.275
F-L-E-I...

29:36.308 --> 29:37.576
Oh, you know him?

29:37.609 --> 29:40.112
Okay, well, then I guess
you're the person I need

29:40.146 --> 29:41.547
to be speaking to.

29:41.580 --> 29:45.117
Um, I've known
Professor Fleinhardt

29:45.151 --> 29:48.487
for approximately 17 years,

29:48.520 --> 29:52.424
and I'll be the first to admit
he's an eccentric.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.194
I'm aware that that's
your concern.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.065
Yeah, but he's brilliant.

29:59.098 --> 30:04.270
He's the kindest, most decent
person I know.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.573
Yes.

30:07.606 --> 30:12.311
I am, I am personally
vouching for him, yes.

30:12.344 --> 30:15.147
Well, I appreciate that.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.952
Uh, yeah, yeah.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.889
Yeah, I guess that is all
I have to say.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.290
Thank you.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.895
(mouthing)

30:33.599 --> 30:35.501
Hey. So, got something?

30:35.534 --> 30:38.237
Yeah, I did what I said I was
going to do.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.571
I compared the killer's
messaging patterns

30:39.605 --> 30:42.875
against our Parents
Stop Predators group

30:42.909 --> 30:45.244
and I've isolated a near match
within an error margin

30:45.277 --> 30:46.979
of five percent.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.081
All right, so who?

30:49.115 --> 30:52.351
According to my math,
Brendan McCrary.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.986
No, no, that's not possible.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.988
He's already alibied
for two of the murders.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.925
Yeah, but Charlie's saying
he found a near match.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.626
You know they say people
and their pets start

31:00.659 --> 31:02.328
to look alike?
Same thing happens

31:02.361 --> 31:03.562
in family dynamics.

31:03.595 --> 31:06.365
One member of a family will
start to think and speak alike.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.934
What, the family?

31:07.967 --> 31:10.569
Well, the wife did go off
on you pretty good.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.538
Yeah, but going off isn't what
I'm talking about,

31:12.571 --> 31:14.240
'cause that's too explosive.
This kind of

31:14.273 --> 31:16.575
rage is, is calculated
carefully.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.978
All right, well, if you
don't think it's the wife,

31:19.011 --> 31:20.312
there's only one survivor left.

31:22.048 --> 31:25.384
All right, Matt, this
is from your laptop.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.218
List of sexual predators,

31:26.252 --> 31:29.055
these are chat room
conversations.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.190
He says you downloaded it
from my computer. Is that true?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.558
Four of the names
from your father's list

31:32.591 --> 31:33.525
were murdered.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.526
Now, he didn't do it.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.028
You're the only
other source.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.197
You going to tell me
what I want to know?

31:38.230 --> 31:40.532
Agent Eppes asked you
a question, son.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.302
I didn't kill anyone.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.570
Who did?

31:46.405 --> 31:47.473
Hey, look, it makes sense

31:47.506 --> 31:50.042
that you'd want to get back
at people like that--

31:50.076 --> 31:51.477
what happened with
your sister.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.479
It's normal, it's natural.
I would, too.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.347
But that makes you
just like them, right?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.085
Is that what you
really want to be?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.255
No.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.325
Sweetie...

32:06.358 --> 32:09.595
I didn't know they were going
to get hurt, I swear.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.030
Tell them what
they need to know.

32:12.364 --> 32:15.367
I met this person
in a chat room

32:15.401 --> 32:17.669
for families of victims
of sexual predators.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.571
I didn't know his name
or anything about him.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.207
All I know is that he listened.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.674
Honey,

32:22.708 --> 32:25.311
if you were having problems,
why didn't you come to us?

32:25.344 --> 32:27.213
What were you going to do?

32:27.246 --> 32:28.680
- Matt!
- Oh, seriously,

32:28.714 --> 32:31.650
Dad, you're too busy
with your Catch The Creep group.

32:31.683 --> 32:32.718
And you?

32:32.751 --> 32:34.620
You don't even come out
of your room half the day

32:34.653 --> 32:37.489
except to go into Katie's
bedroom to look around.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.258
You don't think I see?

32:40.359 --> 32:43.062
I loved Katie.

32:43.095 --> 32:46.065
Losing her sucked.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.266
But I didn't just lose her.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.268
I lost you, too.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.605
This person you said you met,
what'd you talk about?

32:53.639 --> 32:57.009
My dad's group, mostly.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.511
How useless they are getting
these guys into counseling.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.548
How counseling doesn't
do anything.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.316
You gave him the names, right?

33:04.350 --> 33:06.018
It's...

33:06.052 --> 33:08.287
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.455
(sniffles)

33:09.488 --> 33:10.589
I'm sorry.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.594
LARRY:
Hey, Charles.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.497
I thought you should know.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.032
Yeah?
I heard from NASA.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.367
- Uh-huh?
- I'm back on the mission.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.102
Oh, that's... that is great.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.370
Congratulations.

33:24.403 --> 33:27.306
Well, apparently,
someone at the NSA

33:27.339 --> 33:28.607
did some arm twisting.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.043
Oh, well, they're the experts,
off the record.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.611
Well, on the record...

33:32.644 --> 33:34.546
thank you very much.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.548
I didn't do anything...

33:36.582 --> 33:39.551
aside from making them see
the error of their ways.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.688
Consider it my contribution
to national security.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.391
(laughs): What, you think
having me off planet

33:45.424 --> 33:46.825
improves our security?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.727
I didn't say it.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.297
Well, I know you
don't want me to go.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.100
And therein lies the
nobility of what you did.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.235
What I did was repay a debt.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.703
You don't remember
this, do you?

33:57.736 --> 34:03.242
But, uh, when I was a
14-year-old kid at Princeton...

34:03.275 --> 34:05.744
...when we first met, do you
remember what you said to me?

34:05.777 --> 34:09.515
Oh, as I recall,
I said many things.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.717
You said...

34:11.750 --> 34:14.620
that you wanted to see me
safely launched

34:14.653 --> 34:17.323
into the academic firmament.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.560
Now it's your turn.

34:21.593 --> 34:24.196
Listen, just so you know,

34:24.230 --> 34:26.298
it's always harder
on the mentor

34:26.332 --> 34:28.400
than it is on the student.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.406
COLBY: I traced the username
of the person

34:34.440 --> 34:36.142
that Matt McCrary talked
to in the chatroom.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.376
- Right.
- It was a dead end.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.211
Yeah, guy keeps covering
his tracks, right?

34:39.245 --> 34:40.379
How about you,
you got anything?

34:40.412 --> 34:42.681
I keep going over
my interview notes.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.883
Matt McCrary had a conversation
with the killer

34:44.916 --> 34:46.685
talking about
how useless counseling is

34:46.718 --> 34:47.753
for guys like these.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.421
Sounds an awful lot like

34:49.455 --> 34:51.323
my conversation
with Elaine Tillman.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.291
The first victim's wife?

34:52.324 --> 34:54.826
You think she had something
to do with this?

34:54.860 --> 34:56.362
MEGAN:
She said her husband swore

34:56.395 --> 34:57.563
he would never touch their kids.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.531
What, she lying?

34:59.565 --> 35:01.800
We never did find
his video confession online.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.469
I think I know why.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.736
Because she didn't need
a confession.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.338
Right, 'cause she already knew.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.906
All right, so going with
that theory,

35:07.939 --> 35:09.341
I get why she kills her husband,

35:09.375 --> 35:11.243
but what about
the rest of the guys?

35:11.277 --> 35:14.446
The notification letter Brendan
McCrary sent the Tillmans must

35:14.480 --> 35:16.148
have been the trigger that
just pushed her

35:16.182 --> 35:17.916
over the edge,
and then she met Matt online.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.819
And she knew that there were
all these other men out there

35:20.852 --> 35:21.887
just like her husband.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.954
COLBY:
We know Scott Tillman taught

35:22.988 --> 35:25.391
computer science in
high school, so she could've

35:25.424 --> 35:26.925
learned what
she needed to know from him.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.495
Architect of
his own demise.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.303
DAVID: We checked Elaine
Tillman's e-mail.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.171
Over the past three months,
she's contacted

35:39.205 --> 35:40.739
a half a dozen
real estate agencies.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.574
She did say her and
her husband were looking

35:42.608 --> 35:43.409
to buy a bigger house.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.177
She used a different
name to contact

35:45.211 --> 35:46.712
the real estate agent,
make the appointment.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.579
All right, where is she?

35:47.613 --> 35:49.515
Two hours ago,
she dropped the kids off

35:49.548 --> 35:50.882
with a neighbor,
said her mom was sick,

35:50.916 --> 35:52.518
had to take her to the hospital.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.586
Uh, no, she's lined up
her next victim.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.555
All right, how many houses
are in here?

35:56.588 --> 35:57.889
- Almost 100.
- Yeah, at least.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.825
All right, let's get it up
to Charlie.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.728
So I mapped all the locations
of the houses

36:02.761 --> 36:04.296
on Elaine Tillman's list.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.597
And assuming
she's sticking

36:05.631 --> 36:06.765
to live uploads,

36:06.798 --> 36:08.534
she's gonna need a strong
WIFI connection.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.202
All right, I don't want to go
to the wrong house again, so...

36:10.236 --> 36:12.271
Doesn't even matter
because this time

36:12.304 --> 36:13.772
we'll know where
she's transmitting from.

36:13.805 --> 36:14.873
Yeah, and how's that?

36:14.906 --> 36:16.608
When I did my real estate
analysis,

36:16.642 --> 36:18.344
I was looking at
WIFI connectivity.

36:18.377 --> 36:21.313
In fact, I had your techs
cross check the database

36:21.347 --> 36:23.515
of broadband users
in these areas

36:23.549 --> 36:25.684
against owners of
wireless routers.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.253
That sounds like
a lot of houses.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.186
Not where we're looking.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.921
Because, remember,
she was choosing houses

36:29.955 --> 36:32.558
in Jessica's Law hot zones.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.760
Overlaying those hot zones

36:34.793 --> 36:37.496
over our map of houses
and factoring in

36:37.529 --> 36:40.399
for WIFI connectivity,
I've isolated five locations

36:40.432 --> 36:41.967
where she'll likely strike next.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.835
All right, I'm gonna get
LAPD into those areas.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.571
As soon as we find her car,
we're gonna move in.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.342
There's Elaine Tillman's car.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.610
House is around the corner.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.745
2152 Floresta.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.847
And LAPD has the perimeter?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.383
Let's take the house.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.818
(indistinct radio transmission)

37:02.654 --> 37:04.022
(yells)

37:04.055 --> 37:05.424
What do you want from me?!

37:05.457 --> 37:07.593
Everything!

37:08.660 --> 37:10.028
FBI!

37:10.061 --> 37:11.863
FBI!

37:11.897 --> 37:13.832
FBI!

37:18.304 --> 37:20.606
One more step and he's dead!

37:20.639 --> 37:21.807
Elaine, nobody's doing anything.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.343
Nobody's gonna move
until you and I talk.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.977
About what?
You know why I'm here.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.347
- You know what I have to do.
- I know what happened.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.849
I know your husband
hurt your daughter.

37:30.882 --> 37:31.983
He lied to me.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.786
He promised he'd never
touch Susan!

37:34.820 --> 37:36.622
I want you to think about
your kids, okay?

37:36.655 --> 37:39.057
Your children do not
want you to do this.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.393
This man never touched
your daughter.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.628
What about the other daughters?!

37:42.661 --> 37:44.029
I have to stop them!

37:44.062 --> 37:44.963
No!

37:49.000 --> 37:51.337
What difference does it make?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.872
If I kill him or not,
they're gonna shoot me anyway.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.342
MEGAN: Elaine, no one's gonna
shoot you. Listen to me.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.644
We have proof.
We have his words

37:58.677 --> 37:59.645
on his computer.

37:59.678 --> 38:00.979
We know why he came here.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.781
He's not walking out
of here a free man.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.384
Put down that knife

38:05.417 --> 38:06.518
and he's going to jail.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.986
And there's nothing
you can do to him

38:08.019 --> 38:09.521
that isn't going to be worse
in there.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.337
(crying):
Just don't...

38:25.371 --> 38:26.438
just...

38:28.907 --> 38:30.308
Okay.

38:38.116 --> 38:41.820
DISPATCH: All units, be advised,
suspect is in custody...

38:41.853 --> 38:43.355
You okay?

38:43.389 --> 38:46.358
Yeah.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.495
I thought for sure
she was gonna kill me.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.363
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.470
(chuckling)

38:58.504 --> 38:59.871
DON:
All right...

38:59.905 --> 39:02.007
All right, Larry, here you go.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.074
I got you a few extras

39:03.108 --> 39:05.944
in case you run into any,
uh, I don't know, aliens

39:05.977 --> 39:07.646
or something.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.780
My colleagues
in space salute you.

39:08.814 --> 39:09.981
It'll be reassuring

39:10.015 --> 39:13.385
to know that we have an FBI
presence out there in orbit.

39:13.419 --> 39:14.753
How do you know
we don't already?

39:14.786 --> 39:16.021
That's right.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.757
Professor, it's often
been confusing...

39:18.790 --> 39:20.826
it's always been real, man.
Take care, okay?

39:20.859 --> 39:22.027
LARRY:
See ya.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.129
COLBY:
I second that, Fleinhardt.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.731
I'll be looking up
for you, bud.

39:25.764 --> 39:26.732
- Take care.
- All right.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.467
Careful
up there, all right?

39:28.500 --> 39:29.501
Yeah.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.502
See you around, Don.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.503
I'll miss you.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.142
Professor Fleinhardt.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.914
Well, if you ever
need to call...

39:42.948 --> 39:45.817
I'll just put it
on the NSA's tab.

39:57.829 --> 39:58.697
I'll walk you outside.

40:02.968 --> 40:03.869
Take care now.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.036
See ya.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.583
(voice breaking): Well, I guess
the next time I see you,

40:17.616 --> 40:20.085
you'll be in
your space suit.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.655
Isaac Newton
had his apple.

40:23.689 --> 40:25.591
But it took you

40:25.624 --> 40:28.894
falling into my life
to make me see the world anew.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.763
Even I became new.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.599
And how we see ourselves

40:33.632 --> 40:35.601
changes how we see the world.

40:37.235 --> 40:39.571
Even from space.

40:44.943 --> 40:45.911
Just be careful.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.082
Well, I've got to go.
Someone's waiting.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.087
Is that Buzz Aldrin?

40:56.121 --> 40:59.991
I think NASA figured I'd
need help finding my way.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.228
Bye, Larry.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.639
(giggles)

41:13.672 --> 41:18.810
* She packed my bags last night,
pre-flight *

41:21.847 --> 41:26.051
* Zero hour, 9:00 a.m.

41:28.119 --> 41:32.624
* And I'm gonna be high...

41:32.658 --> 41:33.792
(launch announcers speaking
indistinctly)

41:33.825 --> 41:36.061
* ...As a kite by then

41:36.094 --> 41:37.228
I have goose bumps.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.363
(nervous giggling):
Me, too.

41:38.396 --> 41:41.533
Hey, he'd better wear one
of our hats on TV, right?

41:41.567 --> 41:43.802
But how's he gonna get the hat
over the pressure suit, though?

41:43.835 --> 41:44.936
Fleinhardt

41:44.970 --> 41:45.971
in a pressure suit.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.773
That's a visual I don't need.

41:47.806 --> 41:49.240
- Aw...
- I can imagine!

41:49.274 --> 41:50.609
You're awfully quiet.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.678
* It's lonely out in space

41:52.711 --> 41:54.880
It's just not every day you get
to see your friend

41:54.913 --> 41:55.981
live out his dream.

41:56.014 --> 42:00.051
It's not every friend
that gets to make it happen.

42:00.085 --> 42:00.986
T-minus 30 seconds.

42:01.019 --> 42:01.687
CHARLIE:
Hey, whoa, Dad!

42:01.720 --> 42:02.921
All right, you're...
Come on!

42:02.954 --> 42:04.189
- You're gonna miss it.
- Alan!

42:04.222 --> 42:06.157
Hold the countdown,
I got the drinks.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.793
Wait, what's the deal,
no champagne?

42:07.826 --> 42:09.695
Well, in honor of Larry,

42:09.728 --> 42:12.163
and given his propensity
for white food, I figured

42:12.197 --> 42:14.065
milk is the most
appropriate.

42:14.099 --> 42:18.604
* 'Till touchdown brings me
'round again to find I'm... *

42:18.637 --> 42:19.938
A toast to Larry.

42:19.971 --> 42:23.008
Yes, may the orbit
rise with you.

42:23.041 --> 42:26.177
And may the solar winds
be at your back.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.279
(launch announcer speaking
indistinctly)

42:28.313 --> 42:29.681
I think you've
been hanging out

42:29.715 --> 42:30.916
with us nerds
for too long.

42:30.949 --> 42:31.983
Wait, wait, here we go.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.752
ANNOUNCER:
And minus-10...

42:33.785 --> 42:35.220
ALL:
Nine, eight...

42:35.253 --> 42:37.222
seven, six...

42:37.255 --> 42:39.591
five, four...

42:39.625 --> 42:41.793
three, two...

42:41.827 --> 42:43.795
ANNOUNCER:
...one. And liftoff.

42:43.829 --> 42:45.931
Opening a new chapter
in the completion of

42:45.964 --> 42:48.133
the International Space Station

42:48.166 --> 42:51.002
for the collaboration
of nations in space.

42:51.036 --> 42:53.004
- Godspeed, Larry Fleinhardt.
- * Rocket man...

42:53.038 --> 42:53.905
DON:
All right, Larry!

42:53.939 --> 42:57.342
* Burning out his fuse up here
alone *

43:00.378 --> 43:04.983
* And I think it's gonna be
a long, long time... *
