Okay, guys, ponchos up.

08:21.809 --> 08:23.175
Oh, no, here it comes. Here it comes.

08:23.176 --> 08:25.745
(SNEEZES) Oh!

08:25.746 --> 08:28.281
- Yeah!
- Got me wet! Haha!

08:28.282 --> 08:29.148
All right!

08:29.149 --> 08:31.518
Did you get it on you? I got it on me.

08:31.519 --> 08:33.953
Ooh, wow, that was a wet one, Bebe.

08:33.953 --> 08:35.337
Let me clean you up here.

08:36.441 --> 08:37.957
Uh, Phil? Phil?

08:37.957 --> 08:39.325
- Hi.
- Yeah, Andy, what's up, man?

08:39.326 --> 08:41.227
Sorry, just trying to break
down stuff for tonight.

08:41.227 --> 08:42.561
No, I see that. I need to see the baby.

08:42.562 --> 08:43.895
- Real quick, if you don't mind.
- Oh, but,

08:43.897 --> 08:45.691
- you just saw the baby.
- Oh, I know.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.071
That was actually the
last show of the night.

08:47.073 --> 08:48.500
- So we're gonna break down for tomorrow.
- I know, I get it.

08:48.501 --> 08:50.903
Let me just see the baby one more
time. I can't explain it, please.

08:50.904 --> 08:52.738
I need you to quiet down
and walk away calmly.

08:52.739 --> 08:54.941

- Mike, get in here.

08:54.942 --> 08:56.943
- Baby's off the clock!
- Oh, my God!

08:56.944 --> 08:58.644
- You brought this on your self, Andy.
- No! No! No!

08:58.645 --> 09:00.313
- You brought this on yourself, okay?
- Come on!

09:00.314 --> 09:02.531
I hate this. I hate this, too.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.584
This is the fucking good life, dude.

09:05.585 --> 09:07.954
I've never seen this much
money before in my life.

09:07.955 --> 09:10.388
- Think all the shit we could buy, dude.
- Bills, bills, bills.

09:10.389 --> 09:12.623
Dude, we should get all of 311 on vinyl.

09:12.624 --> 09:14.859
Vinyl is like CDs, but bigger
and they're harder to play,

09:14.860 --> 09:17.128
and like, they sounded better in
the '70s or something like that.

09:17.129 --> 09:18.796
- Right.
- I don't really know, but they cost a lot.

09:18.797 --> 09:19.998
- It's gonna be sick.
- Cool.

09:19.999 --> 09:22.200
I'm gonna buy expensive-ass
chain wallets at Rat Hot Topic.

09:22.201 --> 09:23.935
- Dude, Zippo lighters.
- Zippo lighters, man!

09:23.936 --> 09:25.370
We could get 'em engraved
with our names on 'em.

09:25.371 --> 09:26.022
Yeah.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.939
I'll get one that says Mike and
you get one that says Phil.

09:27.940 --> 09:29.174
- That'd be so funny and cute.
- Maybe.

09:29.175 --> 09:31.977
Well, just be sure to spend
your pennies wisely, gentlemen.

09:31.978 --> 09:33.345

Look at all this money. Mike
and I are fucking rich.

09:38.017 --> 09:40.385
Well, I just want to make sure
you're fiscally responsible

09:40.386 --> 09:43.188
because the deals you guys signed...

09:43.189 --> 09:45.456
Well, I've got 'em right here, actually.

09:45.457 --> 09:46.656
- What?
- Let me see this.

09:46.657 --> 09:47.992
- Mike, what are those numbers?
- Wait...

09:47.993 --> 09:49.259
Are those in our favor or his favor?

09:49.260 --> 09:51.495
Okay, let's see, so I
get a finder's fee,

09:51.496 --> 09:55.432
70% overall ownership, and
55% on merchandising.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.801
Wha... I... And I guess you guys get...

09:57.802 --> 09:59.436
a little bit less than that.

09:59.437 --> 10:01.071
- I...
- I hope there are no objections.

10:01.072 --> 10:03.540
My uncle's a pretty powerful rat lawyer.

10:03.541 --> 10:06.276

he's littler than us?

10:15.887 --> 10:17.054

10:17.055 --> 10:19.656
- He got us.

- Aargh!

10:20.657 --> 10:22.325

wanted our autographs.

10:22.326 --> 10:24.327
I know, he's such a fucking
nerd that I thought that too.

10:24.328 --> 10:26.329
- Yeah.
- I didn't read that piece of paper.

10:26.330 --> 10:28.664
I don't have a dad, so I don't
know how to read, okay?
