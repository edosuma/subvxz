00:01.359 --> 00:03.737
Come on!

00:03.862 --> 00:05.380
Yeah!
That's what happens, man.

00:05.697 --> 00:06.797
How old are you?

00:06.865 --> 00:08.098
Wha? That's weird,

00:08.166 --> 00:09.885
'cause that's really young
to be a bitch!

00:10.168 --> 00:11.302
I see you.

00:12.938 --> 00:15.172
Boom! No!

00:15.240 --> 00:18.876
If this was jail, I would
You in the shower!

00:18.944 --> 00:20.377
- Block!
- Blake, let's go.

00:20.445 --> 00:21.730
We're leaving for the office now.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.524
Have you been playing
playstation all night?

00:24.783 --> 00:26.383
Warriors don't sleep.

00:26.451 --> 00:28.028
I'll be just a minute, man.
It's almost over.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.287
I'm not giving you a minute.
The 'vo's a s'go!

00:30.355 --> 00:33.617
Argh, the 'vo's a s'go,
though, don't you know.

00:33.858 --> 00:36.193
I think Blake seriously
has a problem with that thing.

00:36.261 --> 00:37.704
- Maybe.
- Hold up!

00:37.929 --> 00:39.623
- Here we go.
- What's up?

00:39.789 --> 00:41.198
You want a ride to work,

00:41.266 --> 00:43.168
you gotta jump in, warrior.

00:43.401 --> 00:44.670
Aw, come on, guys,
stop the car.

00:44.903 --> 00:46.303
I missed Jamie foxx
on Charlie rose

00:46.371 --> 00:47.798
because of you
and that playstation, bub.

00:48.039 --> 00:49.132
I d.V.R.'D it!

00:49.298 --> 00:50.384
One...

00:50.550 --> 00:51.475

00:53.979 --> 00:56.080
Oh.

00:56.147 --> 00:57.514
Oh, my God,
I don't believe this.

00:57.582 --> 00:59.850
- Excuse me.
- You got choco tacos?

00:59.918 --> 01:01.352
I'm lookin' for a chipwich.

01:01.419 --> 01:02.729

taking over your life, man.

01:19.504 --> 01:21.205
Yeah, when's the last time
you took a shower?

01:21.273 --> 01:24.541
I'll take a shower
when I make the top 50.

01:24.609 --> 01:26.503
Top 50 of what?

01:26.669 --> 01:28.245
The top 50 players
on the leader board

01:28.313 --> 01:29.446
get to take a trip to Vegas

01:29.514 --> 01:31.448
to be in this big kumite tournament.

01:31.516 --> 01:32.850
Uh, that's like <i>bloodsport.</i>

01:32.917 --> 01:34.084
There's a rumor that

01:34.152 --> 01:35.386
Jean-Claude Van damme's
gonna be there.

01:35.453 --> 01:37.187
That sounds awesome.
So what are you ranked?

01:37.255 --> 01:39.890
- 7,769.
- Oh, so he's right there.

01:39.958 --> 01:42.793
Yeah. I am.
I just need to train a little,

01:42.861 --> 01:44.061
and then I might get to meet
Jean-Claude

01:44.129 --> 01:45.562
and get his "Claude-o-graph."

01:45.630 --> 01:46.864
- All right.
- That's cool.

01:46.931 --> 01:48.866
I got Wesley snipe's
Claude-o-graph

01:48.933 --> 01:50.200
at a menards when I was a kid.

01:50.268 --> 01:51.468
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:51.536 --> 01:52.970
My mom kissed Evander Holyfield

01:53.038 --> 01:55.365
at a house party before I was born.

01:55.531 --> 01:56.907
- See me fade away!
- Oh!

01:56.975 --> 01:58.952
Oh, that almost went in!

01:59.118 --> 02:01.413
Hey, Jillian, sweetheart.
Have you been crying?

02:01.579 --> 02:04.040
I mean, like, more than,
like, your normal amount?

02:04.206 --> 02:05.549
A little bit, yeah.

02:05.617 --> 02:07.985
Alice is in an especially
shouty mood today.

02:08.053 --> 02:09.320
Her divorce papers came through,

02:09.387 --> 02:11.757
and she's just been
acting like a real trick.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.259
Divorce papers?
Cool.

02:14.425 --> 02:15.559
I'm not afraid of her.

02:15.627 --> 02:17.429
I will head-butt
that cross-eyed bitch.

02:17.653 --> 02:18.555
Jillian, get back to your desk.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.863
Totally.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.098
Holmvik, do you have
that website proposal

02:21.166 --> 02:22.100
for me, or what?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.602
Yes. Yeah, yeah,
I got it right here.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.770
Ahem.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.229
'Sup, Alice.

02:26.395 --> 02:27.397
I hate your voice.

02:27.563 --> 02:30.358
Um, it's not coming on
for some reason.

02:30.524 --> 02:32.242
Really?
So that's a no.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.444
Look, I'm gonna need that asap,

02:33.511 --> 02:34.780
or I'm going with a pro.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.491
Um, let me take it to a place
over the weekend.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.149
They can take a look at it.
I'll have it for you Monday.

02:39.217 --> 02:40.535
I mean, I did the whole thing
for free, so...

02:40.701 --> 02:41.870
Oh, I did the whole thing for free.

02:42.036 --> 02:42.954
Just get it done.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.540
Also, some sales would be nice.

02:45.706 --> 02:49.169
Workin' on it.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.761
Wow, ders.

02:50.829 --> 02:52.589
She doesn't need another man
in her life disappointing her.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.998
What are you gonna do next,
kick her down some stairs,

02:55.066 --> 02:56.900
pour some gasoline on her,
light a match,

02:56.968 --> 02:59.763
maybe piss on her
to put the flames out?

02:59.929 --> 03:01.848
Also, some sales would be nice, guys.

03:03.575 --> 03:04.601
Hey.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.852
What do you want?

03:06.211 --> 03:08.772
I just want to let you know
that you're not alone.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.615
We're here for you.

03:11.683 --> 03:13.360
I'm here for you.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.779
Have you made any sales today?

03:15.945 --> 03:19.390
Ooh, you are angry.
I like that.

03:19.457 --> 03:21.825
If I got divorced, I'd probably
be pretty angry, too.

03:21.893 --> 03:23.370
First I'd have to get married,
but then...

03:23.536 --> 03:24.528
- Oh.
- If I did divorce...

03:24.596 --> 03:25.497
You need...

03:25.663 --> 03:27.498
To get back on the man-horse, right?

03:27.565 --> 03:29.666
'Cause I think I know
a certain horse-man

03:29.734 --> 03:32.629
that might want to take you out
for a trot.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.131
Are you seriously
hitting on me right now?

03:35.297 --> 03:37.342
Nay.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.575
No, I'm not.

03:38.643 --> 03:40.053
That was my horse impression
saying no.

03:40.219 --> 03:44.307
I just want to know,
what kind of dudes are you into?

03:44.473 --> 03:45.649
These.

03:45.717 --> 03:48.353
I want a hot-as-balls male model.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.355
Are you online dating?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.122
I need to hire a model

03:52.190 --> 03:53.900
for the company website, you dummy.

03:54.066 --> 03:56.460
Is that right?

03:59.998 --> 04:02.158
'Sup.

04:02.324 --> 04:03.500
...Kind of backpack is just--

04:03.568 --> 04:05.036
- right.
- Hey, bud.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.455
Tell us more.
What's going on?

04:07.621 --> 04:09.039
Apparently, she's looking
for a male model

04:09.107 --> 04:10.340
for the new website,

04:10.408 --> 04:13.587
so I just have to become
a professional male model.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.145
Sounds easy enough.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.247
She's gonna be lookin' at me
in a different light,

04:17.315 --> 04:18.548
probably because we're gonna be

04:18.616 --> 04:20.983
scissoring each other's bungholes.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.846
Ah.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.221
But, like,
what's your planly, Stanley?

04:24.289 --> 04:26.223
This can't just fall
into your huge lap.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.892
I'm gonna find one of those
model searches, win that,

04:28.960 --> 04:31.061
get an agent, go big time, probably...

04:31.129 --> 04:32.230
Oh, here's one.

04:32.397 --> 04:36.733
Who is ready to go to a mall
237 Miles away?

04:36.801 --> 04:38.135
Mmm, not us.

04:38.203 --> 04:41.038
Well,
they've got a wetzel's pretzels,

04:41.105 --> 04:42.324
and I'm buyin'.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.374
You can smell the obesity.
It's amazing.

04:44.442 --> 04:46.844
Oh, my God.
I love these pretzels.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.111
They make me wet-zels.

04:48.179 --> 04:49.246
They make-a me wet-zels.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.050
Ooh, welcome to
whale tail country, gentlemen.

04:53.117 --> 04:55.052
Uh-oh!
Tail spotting.

04:55.119 --> 04:56.296
- Uh-oh.
- Starboard side, four o'clock.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.173
- Very nice.
- And it's real.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.456
Oh, wait.
Wait up.

04:59.524 --> 05:01.259
- Ow.
- What up?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.559
Man, is this garlic
gettin' to you?

05:02.627 --> 05:03.794
Can I get some of that gum?

05:03.862 --> 05:05.295
No, I need every stick.

05:05.363 --> 05:07.390
Defines my jaw line.
I need it for the comp.

05:07.556 --> 05:09.199
It's a <i>men's fitness</i> fact.
August '02.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.134
Vin diesel, <i>xxx</i> spread?
It's in my bathroom.

05:11.202 --> 05:13.003
- I'll let you read it.
- All right.

05:13.071 --> 05:14.671
That guy knows
how to get svelte, real house.

05:14.739 --> 05:16.139
- I'm with you.
- Hey, you know what?

05:16.207 --> 05:17.174
Don't even listen to ders.

05:17.242 --> 05:18.342
I have a feeling today is gonna be

05:18.409 --> 05:19.510
a very tight butthole for you,
my friend.

05:19.577 --> 05:20.911
- Ooh, thanks, blazer.
- Mm-hmm.

05:20.979 --> 05:22.012
At least one of my friends

05:22.080 --> 05:22.989
cares about my hopes and dreams.

05:23.155 --> 05:24.815
I'm not, like,
putting you down.

05:24.883 --> 05:25.742
I'm looking out for you.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.203
This is a joke job.
Babies do it.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.997
Yeah, sexy babies
with incredible discipline.

05:31.163 --> 05:32.422
All right, whatever, man.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.658
I'm gonna go up to genius bar,

05:34.726 --> 05:35.726
see if they can fix my laptop.

05:35.793 --> 05:36.795
Okay?
See you guys later.

05:36.961 --> 05:37.995
All right, man.

05:38.062 --> 05:39.296
I'm gonna hit that sports store,

05:39.364 --> 05:40.364
get my fitness on.

05:40.431 --> 05:42.533
No, Blake.
I need you here.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.800
Help me with my looks, man.

05:43.868 --> 05:44.761
I don't know what I'm doing.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.970
Just keebeing yourself.

05:47.038 --> 05:48.906
Stud muffin.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.073
That's horrible advice.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.726
Most people don't like me, actually.

05:53.545 --> 05:54.578
- Hey, how are you?
- Oh, hey.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.579
How's it going?

05:55.647 --> 05:56.713
Not good.

05:56.781 --> 05:58.715
Listen, I can't get my laptop on.

05:58.783 --> 06:01.485
Got a couple files on here
I really need.

06:01.553 --> 06:02.786
Help me out, please.

06:02.854 --> 06:04.154
Great.
Uh, no problem.

06:04.222 --> 06:05.407
Is your battery charged?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.190
Is the bat...Yeah,
the battery's charged.

06:07.258 --> 06:08.992
I'm not...

06:09.060 --> 06:10.328
That's why they call you
a genius, okay.

06:10.494 --> 06:11.361
Okay.

06:11.429 --> 06:12.580
Yeah, looks like you downloaded

06:12.746 --> 06:14.731
a pretty serious virus.

06:14.799 --> 06:17.168
Do you frequent
any low-security websites?

06:17.334 --> 06:18.602
Oh.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.370
Okay, well, then yeah.

06:20.438 --> 06:21.672
Yeah, of course.

06:21.739 --> 06:23.106
I'm on blacks on blacks
and blacks on blondes,

06:23.174 --> 06:24.092
buff blacks...

06:24.258 --> 06:25.676
Okay.

06:25.743 --> 06:26.845
Um, yeah.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.097
It looks like you got
a pretty serious bug

06:29.263 --> 06:32.350
from a website called
whaletails dot...

06:32.516 --> 06:33.884
No, no, no.
That's impossible.

06:33.952 --> 06:37.054
I'm a full-seat boy shorts
kind of guy.

06:37.121 --> 06:38.121
You know.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.357
I don't.

06:39.523 --> 06:42.259
Oh, okay.
Uh, here's the bigger problem.

06:42.327 --> 06:43.293
Okay.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.595
Underneath your
keyboard here...

06:44.662 --> 06:45.729
Mechanical thing, okay.

06:45.797 --> 06:48.450
You've got quite a bit
of dry semen.

06:55.590 --> 06:57.104
Sorry.

06:57.172 --> 06:58.539
Huh!

06:58.606 --> 07:00.874
Oh, ho, ho.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.076
Mama likes.

07:02.143 --> 07:03.544
Gonna...Squeeze it...

07:03.611 --> 07:06.009
Hey, not bad, not bad.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.115
How can I help you?

07:08.183 --> 07:10.184
Uh, well, I don't know.

07:10.251 --> 07:11.852
I'm just trying to get
into fighting shape,

07:11.920 --> 07:13.892
trying to get a Claude-o-graph,

07:14.058 --> 07:14.922
so maybe pump some iron,

07:14.990 --> 07:16.186
and if you got any steroids

07:16.352 --> 07:18.025
that won't shrink my goods.

07:18.093 --> 07:20.194
Well, you got raw power.

07:20.261 --> 07:22.096
Solid technique.

07:22.163 --> 07:23.664
The thing to work on with amateurs

07:23.732 --> 07:26.321
is usually the mental part
of the game.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.735
Okay, wow.

07:27.802 --> 07:29.866
Looks like I'm talking
to an experienced warrior here.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.576
I used to box in the army.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.953
Listen, you need to visualize, kid.

07:34.119 --> 07:38.166
See your hand going
right through the opponent.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.080
Yeah, sure.
Right through the opponent.

07:40.148 --> 07:41.669
Uh-huh.

07:41.835 --> 07:43.117
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, kid.

07:43.184 --> 07:44.506
You got to see it first.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.720
I see it.
It's like an albino Mike Tyson.

07:46.788 --> 07:47.759
- Uh-uh, no, no, no.
- I see it.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.390
Not with this.

07:49.457 --> 07:53.098
You gotta see it with this.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.897
All right.

07:56.965 --> 07:58.899
Whoa!
What happened?

07:58.967 --> 08:01.668
You know, I can't see so good.

08:01.736 --> 08:04.192
And this is more
my high-fashion look.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.873
Like <i>project runway.</i>
Do you guys watch that?

08:05.940 --> 08:07.070
It's so good this season.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.404
Nice.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.177
Yeah, obviously, it's nice.

08:10.245 --> 08:11.311
It's gorgeous.

08:11.379 --> 08:12.613
Look at all those bedazzles.

08:12.680 --> 08:13.814
Blinding.

08:13.882 --> 08:16.871
I'm not sure if I should go
with this...

08:17.037 --> 08:19.165
Or the marky mark pants-off
rock-a-jock halftime look.

08:19.331 --> 08:21.588
Remember that classic?

08:21.656 --> 08:23.253
From mtv?
You guys don't remember?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.379
Who's marky mark?

08:24.545 --> 08:26.593
Who's marky mark?

08:26.661 --> 08:27.632
Get outta town.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.830
It's mark wahlberg's brother.

08:29.898 --> 08:31.553
Everybody knows that.

08:31.719 --> 08:32.933
Well, whoever he is,

08:33.001 --> 08:34.514
I wouldn't dress like him.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.503
What?

08:36.571 --> 08:39.102
You don't need to be rude, all right?

08:39.268 --> 08:40.474
See, marky mark's look...

08:40.542 --> 08:42.020
Very tight butthole.

08:42.187 --> 08:43.481
But your look

08:43.647 --> 08:45.567
is the loosest butthole
I've ever seen.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.277
You come here in pink.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.282
What did you just say?

08:48.349 --> 08:50.113
He's talking about buttholes.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.152
- No, I-I...
- Pervert.

08:52.220 --> 08:53.283
Come with me, Amy.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.577
You're using butthole
out of context.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.662
You're talking about buttholes,
making everyone feel weird.

08:57.828 --> 09:01.416
Just a...Just a man
trying to win a contest.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.130
All right.

09:03.198 --> 09:04.127
Can I get by?

09:04.293 --> 09:06.266
Not gonna let me by?

09:06.334 --> 09:07.964
'Scuse me.
God, you just...

09:08.130 --> 09:09.924
Okay, this is how you live your life.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.572
Look.

09:11.639 --> 09:13.340
You guys act like
there's not other people

09:13.408 --> 09:17.140
on this escalator
at the same time as...

09:19.214 --> 09:20.681
Ahhh, that's it!

09:20.748 --> 09:21.728
Right through it.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.188
Take it from me.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.651
Even a blind man can land a punch

09:24.719 --> 09:26.816
if he can see it
in his mind's eye first.

09:26.982 --> 09:28.026
So you can't see at all?

09:28.192 --> 09:29.389
Ah, I can see a little.

09:29.457 --> 09:31.592
Caught a piece of shrapnel
in the war.

09:31.659 --> 09:32.947
Lost most of my vision.

09:33.113 --> 09:35.200
Wha--pizza shrapnel?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.492
Big piece of shrapnel.

09:36.658 --> 09:38.161
I didn't even know
that could happen.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.467
You know what, son?

09:40.535 --> 09:42.040
I think you're ready for combat.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.292
- Think so?
- Yeah.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.461
Thank you, <i>sensei.</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:47.712
Yeah.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.506
Uh...Oh, I'm bowing.

09:50.672 --> 09:53.718
Oh, okay.

09:53.884 --> 09:54.915
Uh, listen, lady.

09:54.983 --> 09:56.346
Are you gonna buy anything?

09:56.512 --> 09:58.552
Oh, dude, come on.
You're a grown man.

09:58.620 --> 09:59.849
You can't say things like that.

10:00.015 --> 10:01.288
This is ridiculous, okay?

10:01.356 --> 10:04.020
I'm not saying that she has
a loose butthole.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.147
I'm saying that she is
loose butthole.

10:06.313 --> 10:07.982
You're being so loose of a butthole.

10:08.148 --> 10:09.463
Is English not your first language?

10:09.531 --> 10:10.693
Hiya, dick.

10:10.859 --> 10:12.779
How often are you jacking off
on my laptop?

10:12.945 --> 10:14.072
Okay, ders, I'm in the middle

10:14.238 --> 10:15.657
of a business meeting with my agent.

10:15.823 --> 10:16.658
And a lot of times.
Sorry.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.804
Damn it, just give me a shirt

10:17.872 --> 10:19.273
out of your bag.

10:19.340 --> 10:20.662
Come on, you're ruining this.

10:20.828 --> 10:21.875
♪ are you ready for this ♪

10:21.943 --> 10:22.910
♪ are you ready for this ♪

10:22.977 --> 10:24.778
♪ are you ready for this ♪

10:24.846 --> 10:26.626
♪ are you ready for this,
are you ready for this ♪

10:26.792 --> 10:27.648
Here you go.

10:27.715 --> 10:28.836
As I was saying,

10:29.002 --> 10:30.588
butthole, when used properly
in a sentence...

10:30.754 --> 10:32.840
Who the fuck are you?

10:33.006 --> 10:34.926
- Me?
- Yes.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.890
I'm no one, okay?
I'I'm not part of this sadness.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.179
Adam, we're leaving.

10:38.345 --> 10:40.598
We haven't even had a chance
to change the world yet.

10:40.828 --> 10:43.063
I'm Kyle Walsh.

10:43.131 --> 10:44.102
I handle talent.

10:44.332 --> 10:45.399
- Hi.
- Hey, ders.

10:45.466 --> 10:48.231
Why don't you go wait
in the car, bud?

10:48.469 --> 10:50.837
Let me preface this by saying

10:50.905 --> 10:52.068
I'm not a homosexual.

10:52.307 --> 10:54.775
Personally, I think they're
ruining this industry.

10:54.842 --> 10:55.697
That being said,

10:55.863 --> 10:57.444
you are the sexiest piece of ass

10:57.512 --> 10:58.866
I've seen in months, my friend.

10:59.032 --> 11:01.160
Oh, yes.
Do you model?

11:01.382 --> 11:03.650
In fact, I model.
A lot.

11:03.718 --> 11:06.019
And my black friend online
calls me the white tyrese,

11:06.087 --> 11:07.709
as in beckford, as in b...As in...

11:07.875 --> 11:09.356
- Gibson.
- As in Gibson.

11:09.424 --> 11:10.545
- Look at that corn-fed body.
- Tyrese Gibson.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.626
Beefy.
In all the right ways.

11:12.694 --> 11:13.506
Thank you?

11:13.728 --> 11:14.966
What, did you grow up
pitching hay?

11:15.196 --> 11:16.592
Eating three squares?

11:16.831 --> 11:17.864
Flipping over big rocks,

11:17.932 --> 11:19.304
looking for little roly-polies, huh?

11:19.534 --> 11:20.734
- I didn't.
- No, he did. That's...

11:20.802 --> 11:21.889
That's totally wrong.

11:22.055 --> 11:24.104
Hey, ders,
if you ruin this for me,

11:24.172 --> 11:25.205
I'm gonna ruin your face

11:25.273 --> 11:27.674
harder than I ruined your computer.

11:27.742 --> 11:29.188
- Kyle, where do I sign?
- Oh!

11:29.410 --> 11:31.912
I don't know.
The guy said I was a natural.

11:31.980 --> 11:32.859
Whatever that means.

11:33.081 --> 11:34.414
But I guess he's got a few gigs

11:34.482 --> 11:35.570
lined up for me,

11:35.736 --> 11:37.280
and we'll see how it goes.

11:37.518 --> 11:38.485
It just seems
kind of silly, you know?

11:38.553 --> 11:39.407
It's modeling.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.992
You have beautiful bone
structure.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.327
Thank you, jet set.
It's...

11:42.557 --> 11:43.490
Oh.

11:43.558 --> 11:44.625
Oh, hey, Alice.

11:44.692 --> 11:47.415
I wanted to talk to you
about the website.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.708
See, I had a little snafu
with the hard drive.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.897
- Wow, what's is?
- And, uh--

11:50.965 --> 11:52.199
no, this is nothing.

11:52.267 --> 11:54.797
Um, like I was saying,
my laptop crapped out, and...

11:54.963 --> 11:55.965
These are professional, right?

11:56.131 --> 11:57.633
You actually look pretty decent.

11:57.799 --> 12:00.219
Decently ugly.
Shots fired.

12:00.385 --> 12:02.776
All right, anyway,
just give me a few days.

12:02.844 --> 12:04.478
I'll get the website back pronto.

12:04.545 --> 12:05.979
No, no, no.
You forget about that.

12:06.047 --> 12:07.435
I'm just gonna hire someone who
knows what they're doing.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.937
You...You're a face, holmvik.

12:10.103 --> 12:12.119
Not a website designer.

12:12.186 --> 12:13.566
We're gonna use you for our model.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.109
No! But you said you wanted
to use a professional,

12:15.275 --> 12:16.423
and he's not a professional,

12:16.491 --> 12:17.557
but you said you wanted
to use a professional,

12:17.625 --> 12:18.613
but he's not a professional.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.093
Adam's kind of making sense
right now.

12:20.161 --> 12:22.229
I mean, I put a lot of hard work
into that website.

12:22.297 --> 12:23.797
There's gonna be a whole
interactive menu.

12:23.865 --> 12:24.827
I'm more than a face.
I don't...

12:24.993 --> 12:26.099
I'm all face.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.801
Look.

12:27.869 --> 12:28.969
Oh, my...
Okay, look.

12:29.037 --> 12:31.538
Anders, I am asking you
to do this, okay?

12:31.606 --> 12:33.336
Tomorrow afternoon.
Will you be there?

12:33.502 --> 12:35.942
I'll do what's best
for the company.

12:36.010 --> 12:36.923
You're making a big mistake.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.966
Imagine me.

12:39.132 --> 12:40.301
Tank top, oiled, wearing...

12:40.467 --> 12:42.553
Do you want me to give you
my honest opinion?

12:42.719 --> 12:44.305
You're gonna make me blush.

12:44.471 --> 12:46.219
If you ceased to exist,

12:46.287 --> 12:49.890
it wouldn't matter to me.

12:49.957 --> 12:52.397
I respect your opinion,
but just know this:

12:52.563 --> 12:55.729
My face...

12:55.797 --> 12:57.777
Is an awesome face.

13:07.270 --> 13:09.253
Be free, spirit in the sky.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.207
Another victory.

13:11.373 --> 13:14.225
On some real levels right now,

13:14.292 --> 13:16.212
is ders more handsome than I am?

13:16.378 --> 13:19.430
Well, that there
is a challenging question

13:19.498 --> 13:21.968
because both of you
are extremely handsome men.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.678
- Psh.
- I'm gonna say that right now.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.269
I guess I would have to...
Oh, you know what?

13:25.337 --> 13:27.605
Hey, I got a match starting.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.607
'Bout to fight
this little French girl,

13:29.675 --> 13:31.769
and I think I'm 'bout to kick
her le ass.

13:31.935 --> 13:33.377
Look, I really need
a good friend

13:33.445 --> 13:34.445
to talk to right now.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.614
I'm in a...A chubbing phase.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.901
And it's...I mean, I can't
maintain a jawline like this.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.085
You know what, Adam?
This girl is ranked 65.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.354
So if I beat her,
I'm gonna be on the doorstep

13:43.422 --> 13:44.323
of the top 50.

13:44.489 --> 13:45.856
Alice picked ders,

13:45.924 --> 13:48.411
and now ders is gonna get to put
his thing in her mouth?

13:48.660 --> 13:51.295
Adam, you know, I don't think
that's how modeling works.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.431
But, uh, Alice said that ders
had the look

13:53.498 --> 13:54.333
she was going for,

13:54.499 --> 13:56.085
so unless his face,

13:56.251 --> 13:59.470
like, melts off with acid
or something,

13:59.538 --> 14:00.798
you're out of luck, <i>compadre.</i>

14:06.812 --> 14:09.213
Good night, sweet prince.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.985
Agh! What--
what are you doing to me?

14:15.053 --> 14:16.287
What do you think
I'm doing, huh?

14:16.354 --> 14:18.232
I'm destroying
that pretty face of yours

14:18.398 --> 14:20.693
so you don't model and let Alice
suck on your thing.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.820
Adam, I am not trying
to sleep with Alice.

14:22.986 --> 14:24.530
So you wouldn't let her suck
on your thing.

14:24.696 --> 14:26.764
- Of course I would let her...
- There you go.

14:26.832 --> 14:27.832
Would you not let her suck
on yours?

14:27.899 --> 14:28.966
No, I want her to suck
on my thing.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.334
That's <i>my</i> thing!

14:30.402 --> 14:31.702
You...You're not supposed to let
her suck on your thing.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.270
Would you keep it down?
I am trying to concentrate.

14:33.338 --> 14:36.407
I am two matches away
from cracking the leader board.

14:36.475 --> 14:37.627
Oh, that's too bad.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.045
- Stupid idiot!
- Hey!

14:39.211 --> 14:41.005
What the--
what are you doing, Adam?!

14:41.171 --> 14:43.247
Do you even know how many people
go blind

14:43.315 --> 14:44.383
from pizza shrapnel?

14:44.549 --> 14:46.594
Ders, if you show up
at that photo shoot,

14:46.760 --> 14:47.887
I'm gonna...

14:48.053 --> 14:49.639
- I'm gonna--
- Guess what?

14:49.805 --> 14:52.456
You're on lockdown.
Go to your room.

14:52.524 --> 14:53.958
Get this guy,
trying to authorize lockdown

14:54.025 --> 14:55.228
without a house meeting.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.827
Fine, I'm calling
a house meeting...House meeting.

14:56.895 --> 14:58.189
No, you can't call
a house meeting right now.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.732
All in favor of authorizing
a lockdown on Adam, say aye.

14:59.898 --> 15:00.798
- You can't...
- Aye.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.068
Nay.
No, I said nay, though.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.300
- Nope.
- Sorry, bro.

15:03.368 --> 15:04.568
- Okay, you know what?
- Solitary confinement.

15:04.636 --> 15:06.364
Fine, I don't care.
Call a house meeting

15:06.530 --> 15:08.282
without house rules,
and then it doesn't even matter.

15:08.448 --> 15:09.907
You know what matters, though?

15:09.975 --> 15:11.776
Probably a lot to you.

15:11.843 --> 15:15.540
You don't get to play
my playstation all night long.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.785
Adam, you're being irrational.
Stop it.

15:20.852 --> 15:22.253
You're not this kind of guy.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.256
Hey, I have two matches
till a Claude-o-graph.

15:25.323 --> 15:27.124
Revenge is a dish
best served cold,

15:27.192 --> 15:28.526
so enjoy your cold revenge dish.

15:28.593 --> 15:29.894
Give me that.
Give me...

15:29.961 --> 15:31.462
- You get out.
- Give me it, Adam.

15:31.530 --> 15:32.863
Give it to me! Give it!

15:32.931 --> 15:34.131
Hang on, hang on.
Let me get this.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.199
Adam!

15:35.267 --> 15:36.567
- Get him out.
- Adam, open this door!

15:36.635 --> 15:37.935
- Get him out, Anders.
- I can't.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.270
Give me the playstation!

15:39.337 --> 15:40.604
- Come on.
- Don't do this to me, Adam!

15:40.672 --> 15:41.839
Come on, big guy.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.240
No, I'm breaking the door down.

15:43.308 --> 15:44.642
- What are you doing?
- I'm breaking the door down.

15:44.709 --> 15:45.743
- No--
- Move!

15:45.811 --> 15:47.378
- Jeez, what are you doing?
- Moooove!

15:47.445 --> 15:50.241
You can't break it, Blake.
It's walnut.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.216
Hm.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.552
I see you got my in-fight-ation.

15:54.619 --> 15:56.330
- Yeah, I did.
- You coming to the party?

15:56.496 --> 15:58.122
Hope you're bringing something good,

15:58.190 --> 16:00.558
'cause I'm bringing smashed potatoes.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.503
And fruit punch.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.929
Adam, I'm not gonna fight you,
all right?

16:04.996 --> 16:06.424
I'm above all this.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.665
No, we're partying.

16:07.732 --> 16:09.133
And I hope you're ready
to feel the fury

16:09.201 --> 16:11.302
that is my iPod dock

16:11.369 --> 16:14.223
and my tiki torch, extra oil.

16:14.389 --> 16:15.706
This is getting ridiculous,
all right?

16:15.774 --> 16:18.042
The only reason I'm doing
any of this modeling stuff

16:18.109 --> 16:19.376
is because Alice wants me to do it,

16:19.444 --> 16:20.411
and she's our boss.

16:20.478 --> 16:21.772
That's that, all right?

16:21.938 --> 16:23.190
And besides, if we did fight,

16:23.356 --> 16:24.715
there's no way you'd be able
to handle

16:24.783 --> 16:27.153
my garlic bread and my napkins.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.686
I heard about the fight.

16:28.753 --> 16:30.688
I been taking bets all day.

16:30.755 --> 16:32.575
Y'all gonna make me rich.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.191
Way-way, who you got?

16:34.259 --> 16:35.960
Tall boy?
I'm gonna take that action.

16:36.027 --> 16:37.161
- Give it to me.
- Wow.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.362
Yo, stretch.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.663
Where's that suit
I told you to bring?

16:39.731 --> 16:40.583
The shoot's in ten.

16:40.749 --> 16:41.765
Yeah, I know.
It's in my car.

16:41.833 --> 16:44.101
I'll go grab it.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.370
Take a walk, ders.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.840
I don't want to have to kick
your ass.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.074
Okay, Adam,
this is so dumb, all right?

16:50.141 --> 16:51.709
I'd like to get
to this photo shoot on time.

16:51.776 --> 16:52.776
Try being a pacifist.

16:52.844 --> 16:54.778
Oh, I'll be a pacifist.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.432
I'll pass my fist through your face.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.915
That's not possible.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.018
Oh, isn't it?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.150
- Is that possible?
- What are you doing?

17:00.218 --> 17:01.385
- I'm serious.
- Is this possible?

17:04.689 --> 17:06.942
Dropped 30 spots
in the rankings...

17:07.108 --> 17:08.925
Because of you.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.761
Yeah, Claude-o-graph's gone.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.574
Feel like I threw away
my whole early 20s.

17:15.075 --> 17:15.867
