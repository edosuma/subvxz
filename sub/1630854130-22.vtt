00:04.743 --> 00:07.442
Samantha, the two
offenders that abducted you

00:07.442 --> 00:09.748
asked for $1 million in cash.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.402
So who is your father?

00:11.402 --> 00:13.491
<i>Samantha Beck
and her father Richard</i>

00:13.491 --> 00:16.581
are manufacturing and running
mass amounts of meth.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.018
I could go under.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.106
His name's Adam.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.238
He's solid and he'd like a job.

00:21.238 --> 00:24.328
<i>Richard is
a white supremacist.</i>

00:24.328 --> 00:26.678
And he's feeding it
to his grandchild.

00:26.678 --> 00:29.681
That's why it felt so wrong
between her and her dad.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.206
I'm guessing Sam told you
about the plan.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.077
My buyer's got
more product coming.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.471
- What is it?
- Supplies for the end.

00:36.471 --> 00:39.039
Multiple targets,
many casualties.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.041
You're gonna be in charge.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.045
<i>But that's
the spark you need.</i>

01:29.045 --> 01:32.527
<i>It's just one spark that
ignites what's already there,</i>

01:32.527 --> 01:36.226
<i>what everybody already feels</i>

01:36.226 --> 01:39.490
<i>humming in the air, the storm.</i>

01:39.490 --> 01:41.362
<i>We can all feel it humming.</i>

01:41.362 --> 01:42.841
<i>You can feel it.</i>

01:42.841 --> 01:44.843
<i>You can hear it.</i>

01:56.072 --> 01:59.684
I don't know if I can
listen to it anymore.

01:59.684 --> 02:03.427
Richard, he's just always
talking, talking,

02:03.427 --> 02:05.168
ticking down the days
until the end

02:05.168 --> 02:07.953
and there's blood running
in the streets,

02:07.953 --> 02:10.956
till the storm comes.

02:10.956 --> 02:13.263
That's all I get--

02:13.263 --> 02:17.485
just talking in circles,
nothing specific.

02:20.096 --> 02:24.666
<i>All that poison,
all his hate, it's so thick.</i>

02:24.666 --> 02:28.713
<i>It's always there, constant
whenever you're near him.</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:35.677
<i>Feels like
you can drown in it.</i>

02:37.505 --> 02:39.985
<i>Yet I can't get close enough.</i>

03:02.356 --> 03:03.487
Come on, Cal.

03:05.097 --> 03:08.623
<i>I can't get a single detail
about what he's planning.</i>

03:09.798 --> 03:11.887
<i>Now the days are winding down.</i>

03:13.367 --> 03:15.325
<i>He told me three weeks.</i>

04:36.711 --> 04:39.714
Hey.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.977
Yeah. Yeah.

04:56.165 --> 04:59.603
Hey, what's going on?

04:59.603 --> 05:00.604
What are you doing?

05:00.604 --> 05:01.953
I'm leaving right now.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.303
I couldn't tell you
on the phone.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.131
Wait, wait, wait. Why?

05:06.131 --> 05:08.003
Sam?

05:08.003 --> 05:10.440
Hey.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.920
- I'm going.
- Sam.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.617
I'm gonna pick Callum up
from school

05:13.617 --> 05:14.792
and we're driving out
of Chicago.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.968
- Okay, why?
- You should too.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.927
Sam, can you talk
to me for a second?

05:18.927 --> 05:20.407
He didn't call you?

05:20.407 --> 05:23.323
Who? Your dad? No.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.107
He pushed the date up.

05:25.107 --> 05:28.066
Wait, wait, no, no, no,
that is not possible.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.677
He would have told me.
I've been around.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.896
I'm supposed to be
in charge of supplies.

05:31.896 --> 05:35.160
Why would he move the date?
He had a date that mattered.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.075
Sam?

05:37.075 --> 05:38.860
Can you stop for a second?

05:40.470 --> 05:41.993
He changed it to when?

05:43.908 --> 05:45.127
To today.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.259
I'm supposed to meet him
at the yard at 4:00.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.261
I'm not gonna be there,
and you shouldn't be, either.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.176
Okay, listen,
we can figure this out, okay?

05:51.176 --> 05:52.700
No, we can't.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.093
I'm sorry I got you into this.
- Samantha, don't do that.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.225
Just tell me more.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.009
You have to tell me more.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.750
Okay? What's he doing?

05:59.750 --> 06:01.578
What's he attacking?
What the hell is the end?

06:01.578 --> 06:03.450
- I don't know.
- Sam, I don't believe you.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.713
I don't know details.

06:05.713 --> 06:09.369
All I know is that
a lot of people are gonna die.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.544
- Sam.
- Look, I'm leaving.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.284
Sam. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.982
Move. Get out of my way. Move.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.506
I will move when you
tell me what the plan is.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.205
Did my father tell you
to keep me here?

06:20.205 --> 06:21.946
No. Now tell me.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.343
- Get out of my way.
- Sam. Sam!

06:27.343 --> 06:29.084
Take your key
out of the ignition

06:29.084 --> 06:31.695
and get out of the car.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.393
You gonna shoot me?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.698
Key out of the ignition.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.004
Get out of the car.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.571
And he didn't tell you
to stop me.

06:37.571 --> 06:40.530
No. Now get out.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.314
He doesn't care
about you, Adam.

06:42.314 --> 06:45.405
I promise you, he doesn't,
everything he believes in,

06:45.405 --> 06:46.710
all this nonsense, everything.

06:46.710 --> 06:50.322
I know. Now get out!

06:50.322 --> 06:53.543
Get your hand off the shift.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.763
I'm Chicago police.
Do you understand?

06:58.679 --> 07:00.594
Now get out of the car.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.436
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.089
Got here two minutes ago.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.744
I didn't put Sam on the books,
wasn't sure what you wanted.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.442
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.139
I only got
the same text you did,

07:24.139 --> 07:26.271
that he had to make himself
and took Samantha into custody.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.359
But he was on book?

07:27.359 --> 07:28.752
Yeah, he was at her house.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.145
I don't know what
could have happened.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.320
<i>You were in my house.</i>

07:31.320 --> 07:33.583
You were with my child.
- Why is that?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.542
Why was there
a cop in your house?

07:38.501 --> 07:41.504
You have to start cooperating.

07:41.504 --> 07:42.940
Sam, hundreds of people
are gonna die.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.420
You can't just walk that back.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.291
You can't.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.772
Now, my team is gonna be here
any minute.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.034
The more that you tell them

07:50.034 --> 07:51.514
about what your dad
is planning,

07:51.514 --> 07:53.081
the more that
I can protect you.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.517
- Protect me?
- Yes, protect you.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.779
And you're gonna need it.
- Screw you.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.738
And your son
is gonna need it too.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.480
Don't talk about my son.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.482
- Adam.
- I know you.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.613
I know you.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.093
You were that cop
at my abduction.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.442
Look, I didn't
talk to you then--

08:06.442 --> 08:08.270
What happened?

08:08.270 --> 08:09.619
I'm sorry.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.142
I didn't know what
other choice I had.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.014
I didn't know what to do.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.235
Just tell me what happened.

08:17.235 --> 08:21.501
She told me that Richard
pulled up the date to today.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.632
She was trying to leave town.

08:22.632 --> 08:23.677
She wouldn't give me
any information.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.156
She was gonna leave.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.549
I wasn't gonna know any more
than I did yesterday.

08:26.549 --> 08:27.811
Okay.
Does Richard know she's here?

08:27.811 --> 08:30.335
- No.
- Callum?

08:30.335 --> 08:32.337
No, no, he's at school.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.992
She was gonna pick him up.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.646
She didn't want anything
to do with the attacks.

08:36.646 --> 08:37.995
She wanted to grab her kid
and go,

08:37.995 --> 08:39.257
and I could've
just let them leave.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.824
Why didn't I just let them go?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.478
Hey, did anybody
see you arrest her?

08:42.478 --> 08:43.958
I don't think so.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.264
Okay, where's Richard now?

08:46.264 --> 08:47.570
Tracker says the yard.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.702
Should be there until 4:00 p.m.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.007
That's when he told Sam
to meet him.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.966
Whatever's happening,
it's happening today.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.489
Okay, and Richard
reached out to you?

08:53.489 --> 08:55.186
No!

08:55.186 --> 08:56.884
No.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.887
That's why I--

09:01.628 --> 09:04.195
I don't know.
What do we do now?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.328
Okay, we have any idea why
he moved that date back?

09:06.328 --> 09:08.852
No, but we do know
we are dealing with the head

09:08.852 --> 09:12.639
of a million-dollar DTO
who is also a self-proclaimed,

09:12.639 --> 09:14.945
highly motivated
domestic terrorist.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.425
So we get in front of this now.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.731
And Sam?

09:17.731 --> 09:19.994
She shut down.
She's not talking.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.865
So maybe we stay under,
see if Richard

09:21.865 --> 09:23.388
ties himself up with you?

09:23.388 --> 09:25.260
I reached out to him.
He acted like nothing was off.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.609
I don't think
he's gonna loop me in

09:26.609 --> 09:28.350
till the last second
when it's too late.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.699
What about dry conspiracy?

09:29.699 --> 09:31.483
Is that enough to arrest
and hold him?

09:31.483 --> 09:34.051
Judge says we don't even have
enough for a search warrant.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.619
We'd have to connect Richard
directly to the drugs

09:36.619 --> 09:38.708
if we wanna move
on narcotics charges.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.623
We have to get Sam to talk.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.756
That is our quickest option.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.236
So get in front of the
paperwork on Richard now.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.760
Just start
cracking off warrants.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.588
We'll fill in the
blanks as we go.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.067
Where's Torres?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.852
Oh, yeah,
Ocean's with his mama in Mayo.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.071
They got health checkups.
He'll be out till Saturday.

09:54.071 --> 09:56.944
All right, then have Tac
get eyes on the Becks.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.599
Look, Sam is supposed
to meet Richard at 4:00.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.817
That means we got seven hours.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.732
Hey, I need your help.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.255
If there's
a direct terror threat,

10:04.255 --> 10:06.388
protocol says you contact
Homeland Security immediately.

10:06.388 --> 10:09.086
It will take them eight hours
to open a case.

10:09.086 --> 10:12.655
I only have seven.
- Right. Hank...

10:14.135 --> 10:15.919
You know there are
other ASAs you can call,

10:15.919 --> 10:17.094
that you should call.

10:17.094 --> 10:20.924
I don't trust them.
I trust you.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.753
Listen, this man is not
just preaching hate.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.582
He is going to act on it today.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.802
I gotta move fast.
I need your help.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.284
All right, what do you need
to trust me?

10:33.284 --> 10:34.764
Name it.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.331
- Full transparency.
- Fine.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.986
No, I need full transparency
from you.

10:40.378 --> 10:43.555
Anything that happens,
you gotta tell me.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.122
Yes.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.952
You can have it.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.227
All right, I got
the judge on board.

11:03.227 --> 11:05.012
Verbally signed off
on a deal for Sam,

11:05.012 --> 11:06.970
but it comes with conditions.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.972
We need to have a bulletproof
case against Richard,

11:08.972 --> 11:11.322
so Sam needs to inform
on all of it.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.150
That means she connects
her father to the drugs,

11:13.150 --> 11:15.065
to the location,
and she connects him

11:15.065 --> 11:17.981
to the conspiracy of a terror
attack with evidential proof.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.940
- Okay, so targets, weaponry.
- Exactly.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.419
It can't be circumstantial.

11:21.419 --> 11:24.684
Okay, so what are we
giving Sam in exchange?

11:24.684 --> 11:25.815
Immunity.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.122
What?

11:28.122 --> 11:30.254
Kev, she won't talk for less.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.256
She wants immunity
for her and her kid.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.823
She helped her father
in all of this.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.217
Well, she acted out of fear.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.784
Ruze, I don't care
what she acted out of.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.002
Neither does the law.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.047
She was under
her father's thumb, Kev.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.091
I don't know what to tell you.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.311
Okay, so maybe you feel like

11:43.311 --> 11:45.052
her heart wasn't
all the way in it.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.880
Maybe you think that there is
some part of her that's good.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.403
But come on, no matter how
you slice and dice it,

11:48.403 --> 11:51.362
she helped do this for years.
- I know.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.451
She helped her father
manufacture and sell narcotics

11:53.451 --> 11:56.106
that was used to fund
white supremacy, killing,

11:56.106 --> 11:57.891
and whatever plan he's
got going on right now.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.675
She should do time.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.590
Let's give her a deal, fine.
We give her a deal.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.635
But immunity was never
supposed to be on the table.

12:03.635 --> 12:04.767
She's not innocent.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.247
Yeah,
but what's our other play?

12:06.247 --> 12:08.684
She will not talk for less.
I promise you, she won't.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.079
And there are lives
on the line right now.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.602
So we can sit here,
and we can debate

12:13.602 --> 12:15.778
her innocence all day long,
but that's not gonna help.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.128
It's not gonna get her to talk.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.959
Look, innocent or not,
we have to save her now.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.534
Come on, Adam, let's go.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.405
Get back to work. Let's go.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.973
Manufacturing and
distribution of narcotics,

12:36.973 --> 12:39.410
conspiracy to commit murder,
murder for hire,

12:39.410 --> 12:43.066
and capital murder.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.460
Those are your charges,
which will result

12:45.460 --> 12:46.940
in life without parole.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.943
Or you take this deal
and you talk.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.509
I can tell you,
this is the best deal

12:51.509 --> 12:53.033
you can ever hope for,
the best deal I've ever

12:53.033 --> 12:54.991
convinced a judge to give.

12:56.645 --> 12:57.777
No.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.172
Do you understand the deal
I explained to you

13:02.172 --> 13:04.087
and the charges that
are your alternative?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.046
Yeah, I understand.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.351
And I'm not talking
to any of you.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.788
Why not?
Samantha, have you been--

13:08.788 --> 13:10.093
It was a bad idea
bringing him

13:10.093 --> 13:11.573
in here to try to convince me.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.444
Why?

13:13.444 --> 13:14.489
Why, because I know you?

13:14.489 --> 13:15.620
Oh, you don't know me.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.926
Yes, I do.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.319
I've been with your family
for two months.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.842
I know you.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.365
I know you don't believe
anything that your father does.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.019
It's not in your heart.
- You don't know me.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.760
It's not,
and I'll defend that.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.632
You don't want him attacking
anyone or anything.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.460
You wanted out your whole life.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.158
We're giving you that.
- You're not.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.813
Yes, we are.
Sam, this is your way out.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.815
This is how you get Callum out.

13:35.815 --> 13:40.863
No, this is how I lose him.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.169
You've been with me
for two months,

13:42.169 --> 13:45.041
and you don't
understand that yet?

13:45.041 --> 13:48.392
My father will kill me.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.046
Those aren't some words.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.875
They're not some threat, some
dramatic thing I'm making up.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.617
Look, I am telling you
the truth.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.098
He will kill me.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.842
Then he's gonna
have Callum forever.

14:04.582 --> 14:07.542
We won't let them
touch you or your child.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.241
You can't promise me that.

14:11.241 --> 14:14.897
I can promise that working
with us is a lot safer option.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.034
Sam.

14:23.297 --> 14:26.039
I will not let anything
happen to that boy.

14:28.389 --> 14:32.175
You don't have to trust
a single thing that I've said.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.350
But you can trust
that I will not

14:33.350 --> 14:36.527
let Richard get to that child.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.886
Okay.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.810
All right, well, Samantha
claims she doesn't know

14:58.810 --> 15:00.334
what her father's targeting
or why he moved up the attack.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.552
But she does know
where he stores the cash,

15:01.552 --> 15:03.163
the product, and the supplies.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.904
Apparently,
there's a trap door

15:04.904 --> 15:06.818
behind Beck Trucking
shooting range.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.865
That's where Richard
stores the cash.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.214
What about the drugs?

15:11.214 --> 15:12.694
The lab's in South Hegewisch,

15:12.694 --> 15:14.478
but my father never
steps foot in there.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.394
But the place
has security 24/7.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.527
And where's the rest of it?

15:19.527 --> 15:22.269
Look, you referred to supplies
your father exchanges

15:22.269 --> 15:24.401
for product, for the end.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.968
Where's all that?

15:25.968 --> 15:28.971
When did I refer--

15:28.971 --> 15:30.755
I told you that.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.584
I told you that in my house,
in my living room.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.064
What are the supplies for,
Sam?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.587
Are they for the attack?

15:36.587 --> 15:38.415
How many times do I have
to tell you, I don't know.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.417
Okay, I don't know
everything he's buying,

15:40.417 --> 15:41.679
and I don't know
what he's planning.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.116
I just--I pick things up
and I drop them off.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.379
Pick things up where?
You drop them off where?

15:47.033 --> 15:49.383
He's got a farm in Homer Glen.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.167
Whatever supplies Richard
needs for the attack,

15:51.167 --> 15:53.256
they should be there.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.998
What else do you need?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.652
We need names.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.872
She's gotta positively ID
and inform on everyone,

16:00.872 --> 16:03.440
<i>confirm their criminal roles,
that drugs exchanged hands,</i>

16:03.440 --> 16:06.530
<i>that they helped her father
planning a terror attack,</i>

16:06.530 --> 16:08.402
<i>that she's directly eyewitnessed</i>

16:08.402 --> 16:10.143
<i>criminal activity.</i>

16:10.143 --> 16:12.058
Stanley Davis.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.233
And what does he do?

16:13.233 --> 16:14.930
He works in the lab.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.020
That's William Anderson.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.587
That's John Nelson.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.285
That's Ronald Clark.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.765
Ken Thompson.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.421
And what does he do?
He cooks for us.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.553
He actually used
to be a chemist.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.033
Last but not least.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.296
Victor Dunn.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.863
He's our fixer.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.358
You want me
to go over it again?

16:51.358 --> 16:52.707
Pick up Cal from school.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.536
Act like all is well,
nothing's going on.

16:55.536 --> 16:56.972
And hey, we don't have backup,

16:56.972 --> 16:58.495
so if your dad's
got people watching,

16:58.495 --> 16:59.496
he's not gonna know a thing.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.628
It's all gonna be fine.

17:05.198 --> 17:08.375
Get you guys home, get whatever
you need for the safe house.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.510
You know, that's all you
really gotta worry about.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.128
Do you really
have a daughter?

17:22.128 --> 17:23.477
Yeah.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.350
She really is the
same age as Callum.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.048
Name's Makayla.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.707
What's she like?

17:38.405 --> 17:40.755
She's sweet, smart.

17:42.583 --> 17:47.196
She's really weird. Goofy.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.459
Kinda like Cal.

17:54.464 --> 17:58.077
You know,
it wasn't my whole life.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.730
I didn't always want out.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.779
We aren't born hateful.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.868
It's just--it's grown.

18:08.652 --> 18:12.700
I didn't know that
until Cal was born.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.311
That's when I changed.

18:15.311 --> 18:19.750
All those roots, they just--
they just died because of him.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.017
Well, we're gonna
keep him safe.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.846
We are.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.031
But we never go on trips.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.077
I thought you were
working all weekend.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.600
Yeah, I got the days off.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.167
You've always wanted
to go camping.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.777
I figured it'd be fun.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.605
Well, you're coming too?

18:48.605 --> 18:50.912
Yeah, man.
Yeah, you should go pack.

18:50.912 --> 18:54.568
You know, get your books, toys,
whatever you wanna bring.

18:54.568 --> 18:57.136
I can see you've
already started packing.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.441
Just a little.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.095
And I was doing some cleaning.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.880
Well, can Grandpa come?

19:05.318 --> 19:06.797
No, not this time.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.583
Go on, wanna get on the road
before there's traffic.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.802
- All right.
- Hey, get your cards, yeah?

19:11.802 --> 19:13.152
- Yeah.
- All right.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.985
Hey, we're okay.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.293
Go pack up whatever else
you might need.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.034
You won't be coming back here.

19:33.650 --> 19:37.263
Boss, I got them home safe.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.916
No, no signs of any follows.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.268
And we're a go.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.183
Copy you.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.054
Richard?

19:46.054 --> 19:48.622
Tracker and phone are
still pinging in the yard.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.840
He's here. We're good.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.060
All right, all teams
good to approach.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.801
Let's go.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.727
Chicago PD--let me see your
hands, let me see your hands.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.354
Let's move.

20:45.156 --> 20:50.118
Chicago PD!
Let me see your hands!

20:50.118 --> 20:51.380
Hands, now!

20:51.380 --> 20:53.252
You two, back! Back!
- Get up! Turn around!

20:53.252 --> 20:54.644
Touch the wall, touch the wall.
- We got two!

20:54.644 --> 20:56.603
Hands up.
I'm gonna go grab them.

20:56.603 --> 20:57.778
Hands up!
- Hands in the air.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.432
Hands up.
Don't move, don't move.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.911
Don't do it! Get down!

21:00.911 --> 21:03.262
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.310
Move!

21:08.310 --> 21:10.704
10-1, 10-1,
shots fired at police.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.620
Go! Move, move, move!

21:16.753 --> 21:18.581
Chicago PD!
- Get down!

21:18.581 --> 21:20.583
Don't move!
Put your hands up!

21:20.583 --> 21:21.932
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up!

21:21.932 --> 21:24.283
On the table! On the table!

21:24.283 --> 21:27.721
Gun! Give me that! Now!

21:27.721 --> 21:29.549
Grab the wall!
Take him, Randall.

21:29.549 --> 21:30.680
- Hands up.
- On your knees.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.681
Don't move.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.165
<i>First floor clear.</i>

22:21.165 --> 22:23.472
<i>Targets 6 and 11 in custody.</i>

22:23.472 --> 22:26.649
<i>Negative on Richard Beck.</i>

22:26.649 --> 22:28.738
<i>South barn clear,
negative on Richard Beck.</i>

22:28.738 --> 22:31.262
<i>- Farmhouse clear, no target.
- Location two is clear.</i>

22:31.262 --> 22:33.787
<i>Targets 7, 12,
and 22 in custody.</i>

22:33.787 --> 22:35.354
<i>Negative on Richard Beck.</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:36.877
His cell phone is here.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.359
Tell me somebody has
eyes on Richard Beck.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.751
- Clear.
- Clear.

22:41.751 --> 22:43.797
Okay, let's move.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.283
Clear.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.763
- Clear.
- Clear.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.775
Everybody listen to me.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.822
Wherever you are,
move slow and steady.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.693
We got C-4.

23:10.693 --> 23:14.393
Do not kill your radios
unless you absolutely have to.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.616
Yo, Sarge,
we're all clear here,

23:20.616 --> 23:24.403
but we got blueprints.

23:24.403 --> 23:28.145
Place is full of C-4.
We got blueprints.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.495
It must be blueprints
to his target, Sarge.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.235
He was trying to hit
elementary schools.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.150
- Chester Burnett.
- It's on the South Side.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.283
Sarge, he was trying to kill
children of color.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.852
He moved it up because
two of the schools

23:38.852 --> 23:40.462
were threatening to strike,
and he wanted to make sure

23:40.462 --> 23:41.811
the kids were there.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.554
Search it.

23:45.554 --> 23:46.947
Let's go.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.177
Oh, hell no. We gotta go.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.527
We gotta get up out of here.
We gotta get up out of here!

24:01.527 --> 24:02.702
Come on!

24:29.729 --> 24:30.730
You all right?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.558
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.740
Hey, call out!

24:40.740 --> 24:42.350
Mia!
- Yeah.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.569
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.048
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.702
We're good.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.843
All right, Cal,
let's do this, man.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.279
You ready to go?

25:04.459 --> 25:06.243
Cal.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.289
You in here, bud?

25:10.813 --> 25:11.771
Callum?

25:24.218 --> 25:25.436
Callum?

25:29.658 --> 25:31.573
Okay.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.097
Okay, I will.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.490
Yeah.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.318
Callum, what you
doing up here, man?

25:37.318 --> 25:39.450
We gotta go.
Whose cell phone is that?

25:42.192 --> 25:43.629
Hey.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.849
Yeah, Sarge, I got
everybody out, accounted for.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.677
I got a few injured officers,
but we're okay.

25:48.677 --> 25:51.506
But this whole spot
was rigged, Sarge.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.682
Yes, and I think Richard
remote detonated it.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.121
He had eyes on the inside.
We're burnt.

25:58.121 --> 26:00.297
Copy. We're on our way.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.169
- Is he okay?
- Yes.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.474
Anybody got eyes on Richard?

26:03.474 --> 26:04.650
No, truck's still
in the yard.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.216
Tracker's still on it.
House was empty.

26:06.216 --> 26:08.262
All the raid locations
called in clear.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.524
He knew we were coming.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.482
- Okay, we got BOLOs on him?
- Already on it.

26:11.482 --> 26:13.049
- Who are you?
- Bro, you know who I am.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.661
You put that gun down, man.
- No, I don't. Who are you?

26:15.661 --> 26:18.185
Callum--

26:18.185 --> 26:19.621
you just talking
to your grandpa?

26:19.621 --> 26:21.492
Is that who was
on the phone just now?

26:21.492 --> 26:24.147
He said to call him if Mom
ever tried to make me leave.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.671
He says I can't go camping.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.281
Okay, okay.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.632
- Not without him.
- All right, he can come.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.634
You put the gun down.
We'll go talk to your mom.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.115
He said
not to trust her either.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.378
Callum, it's your mom.
Of course you can trust her.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.814
Yeah, well, he said not to.

26:38.814 --> 26:40.642
And he said that you were
trying to trick us.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.644
No, I'm not trying
to trick anybody.

26:42.644 --> 26:45.952
I--listen, man, I have
a lot of respect for your--

26:45.952 --> 26:46.996
for your grandfather.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.781
I work for him, you know?

26:48.781 --> 26:51.522
We can call him right now
if you put that gun down.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.481
My grandpa is trying
to change the world.

26:53.481 --> 26:54.743
Oh, I know. Yeah.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.136
And he says that you're
trying to stop him.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.616
No, no,
I'm trying to help him.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.443
That's not what he says.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.620
You know he's doing it for us.
- Yeah.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.230
He's getting rid
of all the bad people.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.361
- I know.
- And you're going to stop him.

27:04.361 --> 27:05.798
- No, no.
- You're going to hurt him.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.538
Callum, would you please
put that gun down, man?

27:07.538 --> 27:09.453
Please.
- He's doing the right thing.

27:09.453 --> 27:12.108
I know.
I'm with your grandpa, pal.

27:12.108 --> 27:13.632
Well, he says you're not.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.157
Callum, I'm your friend,
you know?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.245
I don't believe you.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.638
Callum.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.752
What the hell?
Callum? Callum?

27:51.974 --> 27:53.759
Callum?

27:57.284 --> 28:00.548
Come on, come on, go.
- No, no, don't.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.680
- Go!
- Don't go.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.638
Are you kidding me?

28:03.638 --> 28:05.553
Don't leave. Sam, don't leave.

28:05.553 --> 28:06.989
Please don't leave.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.904
I'm sorry. He's my son.

28:08.904 --> 28:11.037
Sam, you can't leave.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.039
Sam.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.231
I got a perimeter
locked four blocks out.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.449
There's no sign
of Richard here.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.147
<i>Copy you.
Negative on explosives?</i>

30:01.147 --> 30:02.888
Nothing but meth components.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.238
Got several in custody
being transported in,

30:05.238 --> 30:06.935
gonna put the screws
to all of them.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.371
One of them's gonna
tell me where Richard is.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.460
Adam?

30:10.460 --> 30:11.722
Yeah.

30:11.722 --> 30:12.854
I want you to keep
them separate,

30:12.854 --> 30:14.290
and put them in room one,
all right?

30:14.290 --> 30:15.944
Hurry up. Everybody listen up.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.250
I want you
to check arrest packs

30:17.250 --> 30:19.730
and see who's on our list,
all right?

30:19.730 --> 30:20.819
What's up?

30:27.869 --> 30:30.480
<i>Adam. Adam, we're on our way.</i>

30:30.480 --> 30:33.527
<i>Hang on, Adam. Stay with me.
Stay with me.</i>

31:08.562 --> 31:11.521
- Come on, Adam. Hang in there.
- Watch your step.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.436
Hey, get a perimeter
around this house.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.785
Copy.

31:14.785 --> 31:17.310
Lock down this neighborhood!

31:17.310 --> 31:18.702
Adam!

31:18.702 --> 31:20.443
- He's breathing.
- Adam.

31:20.443 --> 31:21.967
Pulse is steady.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.751
I'm here. I'm here, okay?

31:23.751 --> 31:25.013
- Lift him up.
- All right.

31:25.013 --> 31:26.406
You go with him.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.453
Come on, let's go.

31:30.453 --> 31:33.021
Shut down every block
between here and Med.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.632
Starting officer down detail now.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.069
Go, go, go! Move!

31:49.037 --> 31:51.126
It's okay. You're okay.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.520
You're not alone, Adam.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.521
You're okay.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.527
Your body's shaking, Adam.

32:00.527 --> 32:01.876
It's just your body
processing the trauma, okay?

32:01.876 --> 32:04.226
They say that it helps
with PTS.

32:04.226 --> 32:08.230
It's your body just
getting rid of it, all right?

32:08.230 --> 32:10.711
Callum was just scared.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.278
What?

32:14.802 --> 32:15.934
Callum was just scared.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.370
Hey, you need
to keep that on.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.589
It doesn't matter now.
It doesn't matter now, Adam.

32:19.589 --> 32:20.939
You have to get to him.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.462
Listen,
you have to keep this on.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.507
We're not worried about them.
We are worried about you.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.336
You have to get there
before--

32:27.336 --> 32:28.990
- Okay. Please--
- Just stop.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.905
- Okay, okay.
- Just listen to me.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.995
You have to find them.
- Okay. Okay, I'm listening.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.997
You have to get there
before Richard.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.477
You have to.

32:37.477 --> 32:38.565
Take that kid--

32:40.306 --> 32:43.265
He's gonna take him.
- Okay.

32:43.265 --> 32:45.093
Okay.
- Promise me.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.790
Okay, I promise.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.967
Okay. Can I put the mask on?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.491
Please?

32:51.491 --> 32:53.449
Okay.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.494
Here we go.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.453
What is that? What's happening?

32:57.453 --> 32:59.542
Can you talk to me?
What is happening?

32:59.542 --> 33:03.851
76 to Med, ETA two minutes
out with the officer down.

33:05.809 --> 33:07.246
You're okay. I'm right here.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.117
I'm not going anywhere.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.380
I'm right by your side.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.600
I'm gonna be right
by your side no matter what.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.390
Stats still dropping fast.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.131
All right, I got OR 3 all
ready set up and ready for us.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.655
Let's move. Hang that epi.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.309
Keep pressure.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.181
Get Conners, OR 3, tell him
I wanna meet him there.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.009
Pressure, pressure.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.315
Ma'am, are you his partner?
Ma'am, you his partner?

33:33.315 --> 33:34.925
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You can't go up.

33:34.925 --> 33:36.971
We're bringing him right in.
The nurses will come find you.

33:36.971 --> 33:39.669
Okay? All right, keep pressure.

33:58.601 --> 34:00.647
- Kevin, you good?
- Yeah, I'm fine. How's Ruzek?

34:00.647 --> 34:02.083
Just got to Med.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.345
Is he stable? Is he okay?

34:03.345 --> 34:04.868
Just wheeled into surgery
right now.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.348
They just put him under.
They just took him into OR.

34:06.348 --> 34:07.958
Okay, listen,
Kim is with him.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.569
There's nothing
we can do there.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.484
But we can find these people.

34:11.484 --> 34:12.833
Callum was
talking to Richard.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.965
Ruzek thinks Richard's
gonna find Callum.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.184
Look, if these two
are communicating,

34:16.184 --> 34:17.751
that means we can track them.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.883
So let's ID these cell phones
and find them.

34:19.883 --> 34:22.364
We'll run it from 21. Let's go.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.656
Kim, what do you know?

34:53.656 --> 34:55.702
Nothing. I know nothing.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.356
They just took him in and they
didn't tell me anything.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.009
Okay, that's normal.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.924
But he got here fast.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.144
That's very good.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.538
And I told the sitter,
I told her to stay with Mac

35:05.538 --> 35:06.800
and not to tell her anything.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.497
Good, that's a good call.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.327
The kid shot him.

35:12.327 --> 35:13.502
Yeah.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.681
<i>Kim, you got your ears in?</i>

35:21.597 --> 35:23.251
Yes, yeah.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.775
<i>We tracked the phone Callum
was using from Sam's Wi-Fi.</i>

35:25.775 --> 35:27.734
<i>He was talking to a burner.
We think it was Richard.</i>

35:27.734 --> 35:29.257
- Okay.
<i>- That's how we got burned.</i>

35:29.257 --> 35:31.172
<i>Callum's sharing his location
with Richard.</i>

35:31.172 --> 35:33.174
<i>We're en route to them.
I'm at 21.</i>

35:33.174 --> 35:34.654
<i>I'll send you a location.</i>

35:34.654 --> 35:36.525
Oh, my God, Adam was right.

35:36.525 --> 35:38.571
He's gonna get his grandson.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.229
In the ambo,
Adam made me promise

35:44.229 --> 35:47.014
to get to Callum first.

35:47.014 --> 35:48.320
Okay, so go--

35:48.320 --> 35:50.670
No, I can't leave him.

35:53.890 --> 35:57.067
Kim, you'd be doing this
for him.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.896
Not for them, for him.

35:59.896 --> 36:03.204
And I'm not
gonna leave his side.

36:03.204 --> 36:06.425
And you made him a promise.

36:06.425 --> 36:08.427
You promised him.

36:11.908 --> 36:15.042
Send me the pings.
I'm on my way.

36:15.042 --> 36:18.828
I got Callum's phone
at a stop, 82nd and Ryan.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.221
Yeah, I got the same thing.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.614
She must have pulled over.
The vehicle's stagnant.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.181
There's a lot of options
around there.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.617
Hold on, I'm narrowing now.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.358
<i>Richard just turned to follow.</i>

36:26.358 --> 36:28.795
<i>He's not that far behind, and
he's closing the gap quickly.</i>

36:28.795 --> 36:31.841
There's a gas station
right at the corner.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.452
There's a few lots nearby.

36:33.452 --> 36:34.670
There's a shopping center.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.281
Burge, Kev, how close are you?

36:36.281 --> 36:38.108
<i>- I'm four minutes out.</i>
- I'm only a minute out.

36:38.108 --> 36:40.546
She might have stopped
for gas and cash.

36:43.897 --> 36:46.595
Come on, come on, come on.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.992
I got eyes.
It's the lot on South 82nd.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.255
She's picking up a clean car.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.742
Chicago PD,
show me your hands.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.874
Stay in the car.
Callum, stay in the car.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.659
Put your hands up, Samantha.

37:06.659 --> 37:08.356
- You know me?
- Yes.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.531
You know me?
You know my son?

37:09.531 --> 37:10.837
You know what he did?

37:10.837 --> 37:12.186
I know what he did,
and I know what you did.

37:12.186 --> 37:13.448
Now, put your hands up.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.058
Is Adam alive?

37:17.147 --> 37:18.845
Adam begged me
to find you and Callum

37:18.845 --> 37:20.281
before your dad did.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.675
I made a promise that
I would keep you both safe.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.764
And I will for him.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.940
But if you don't
put your hands up, Samantha,

37:26.940 --> 37:29.812
I swear to you, I swear to you,
I will take the reason.

37:29.812 --> 37:32.685
So put your hands up
right now, all right?

37:32.685 --> 37:35.078
- You're with Adam?
- I'm with Adam.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.864
We have to say that
I shot him, that I shot him,

37:37.864 --> 37:39.692
not Callum, okay, not my son.
- Fine. Fine.

37:39.692 --> 37:40.954
Look, this one's on me.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.564
This one's my fault.
- Samantha.

37:42.564 --> 37:43.826
It's my family,
it's my blood.

37:43.826 --> 37:45.350
Samantha,
listen to my voice!

37:45.350 --> 37:46.786
Listen to my voice!

37:48.222 --> 37:51.530
I am telling you, okay,
and I'll keep him safe.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.096
But put your hands up.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.491
Good, now walk towards the car.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.232
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

38:06.675 --> 38:09.722
No, no!

38:09.722 --> 38:12.246
- Don't shoot.
- Richard, let him go.

38:12.246 --> 38:13.769
Don't shoot me,
you shoot a child.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.815
Dad, please, please.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.556
I got him, Kim.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.035
Put Samantha in my car.

38:19.035 --> 38:21.299
No, no, I can't leave my son. No.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.778
No, I'm not gonna leave him!

38:22.778 --> 38:24.345
- Stop moving.
- I'm not gonna leave my son!

38:24.345 --> 38:26.739
No, you're letting me leave.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.307
Me and Callum,
we're walking out of here.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.613
That's who you wanna be?

38:31.613 --> 38:35.530
A man using a child
as a human shield?

38:35.530 --> 38:37.053
A child you love?

38:37.053 --> 38:39.099
I do love him.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.362
He's my blood.

38:41.362 --> 38:44.017
He is my shield and I'm his.

38:44.017 --> 38:48.282
If you don't back up
and let us drive out of here,

38:48.282 --> 38:50.545
I will kill us both.

38:50.545 --> 38:51.633
Let him go, Richard.

38:51.633 --> 38:54.636
No, you don't understand.

38:56.769 --> 38:59.772
He doesn't want me
to let him go.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.644
We will give our lives
if that's what it takes.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.429
Isn't that right, Callum?

39:04.429 --> 39:05.691
Yes.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.170
You see?

39:07.170 --> 39:09.129
Open the door.

39:09.129 --> 39:13.438
We will give our life
for the storm, for the war.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.831
Yes.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.050
For our people.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.901
50-21 Eddie,
shots fired by the police.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.816
Offender down, DOA.

39:43.816 --> 39:46.775
Roll crime lab
to 82nd and Ryan.

39:46.775 --> 39:48.864
<i>Copy, 50-21 Eddie.</i>

39:48.864 --> 39:51.214
Hey, Callum.

39:52.651 --> 39:53.869
I just gotta search you.

39:55.523 --> 39:58.004
Just hold still for me,
and we'll pat you down.
