like, your custody with her?
>> ROB: Nothing's going on.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.100
>> KHLOE: Nothing happened from
that day?

10:26.100 --> 10:29.500
>> ROB: No, after, like, an
eight-hour mediation day of

10:29.500 --> 10:32.633
nothing being resolved.
>> KHLOE: Well, that's crazy,

10:32.633 --> 10:37.834
and I'm sorry you have to go
through that.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.700
I know this is super hard for
Rob, because he was so in love

10:40.700 --> 10:43.300
with that girl, and this is
definitely not the way he

10:43.300 --> 10:47.166
thought his relationship was
gonna end, but unfortunately,

10:47.166 --> 10:49.800
this has been really hard on my
mom, as well.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.166
You know, she loves her kids
with everything that she has.

10:53.166 --> 10:56.133
So, any stress or burden that
any of us have, she carries it

10:56.133 --> 10:59.934
on times ten.
I'm sorry, Rob.

10:59.934 --> 11:03.734
Well, as long as Dream's okay.
>> ROB: Hold on.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.433
Hrush is calling me.
I got to go to the Armenian

11:05.433 --> 11:07.266
deli.
I'll call you back.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.266
>> KHLOE: Bye.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, bye.

11:09.266 --> 11:12.000
All right, you know what?
>> KHLOE: What, Kourt?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.633
>> KOURTNEY: You with the furry
slide?

11:14.633 --> 11:17.033
I never could've dreamt it.

11:17.033 --> 11:20.200
>> KHLOE: Listen.
You with the .

11:20.200 --> 11:23.000
>> KOURTNEY: Body outfit on?
>> KHLOE: Yeah, like, where the

11:23.000 --> 11:24.900
are you going?

11:31.700 --> 11:33.867
Here, Reign, go under
the tunnel.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.867
>> PENELOPE: Reign, go under the
tunnel!

11:36.867 --> 11:39.900
>> KHLOE: Turn it around.
>> PENELOPE: Reign, go.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.033
Go in there.

11:43.033 --> 11:46.166
>> KHLOE: Show him.
Reign, look!

11:46.166 --> 11:50.000
Like that. Come.
All right.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.133
>> KOURTNEY: I'm having second
thoughts about going now.

11:52.133 --> 11:54.133
>> KHLOE: Why?
>> KOURTNEY: Come on down.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.300
I want to put the kids to bed.
Reignoosh!

11:56.300 --> 11:58.300
>> KHLOE: Yeah, but they're...
they're just gonna go to bed.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.066
>> KOURTNEY: Thank you.
>> KHLOE: Ah, she went through

12:00.066 --> 12:01.834
on her own.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, but the

12:01.834 --> 12:03.633
bedtime is one of my favorite
times. Like...

12:03.633 --> 12:05.533
>> KHLOE: Kourt...
>> KOURTNEY: ...doing lullabies,

12:05.533 --> 12:07.533
putting on the night light.
>> KHLOE: It's one night.

12:07.533 --> 12:09.367
I think you need to enjoy
yourself.

12:09.367 --> 12:11.200
It's just church.
The kids are with me, it's not

12:11.200 --> 12:16.166
that big of a deal.
>> KOURTNEY: I try to go to

12:16.166 --> 12:19.367
church once a week, and that's
one of the things that I do for

12:19.367 --> 12:24.500
myself, but I don't like
missing, you know, bedtime and

12:24.500 --> 12:26.700
bath time and all the special
moments.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.500
Like, I try to be there as much
as I can.

12:28.500 --> 12:33.266
I just feel like, because I'm
leaving town, I really just

12:33.266 --> 12:35.633
don't know if I should be going
tonight.

12:35.633 --> 12:38.133
>> KHLOE: Cut the cord, Kourt.
Right, Mase?

12:38.133 --> 12:39.967
Tell her to cut the cord.
>> KOURTNEY: Are you gonna be

12:39.967 --> 12:41.967
okay?
>> KHLOE: He's like, "Duh."

12:41.967 --> 12:44.867
>> MASON: Why, for sure.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.934
>> KHLOE: Mom, you look so cute.
Look at you.

13:03.934 --> 13:05.934
>> KRIS: Do I look like I have
any lipstick on?

13:05.934 --> 13:07.900
>> KHLOE: Are you wearing, like,
a nude lip...?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.734
There's a mirror right behind
you.

13:09.734 --> 13:12.100
>> KRIS: Oh.
I'm so tired, I can't...

13:12.100 --> 13:14.800
Yeah, I need a little color.
I just don't even know what to

13:14.800 --> 13:16.800
do.
So, what's up, guys?

13:16.800 --> 13:18.867
>> TRISTAN: Sit down, stay for a
while.

13:18.867 --> 13:22.400
>> KRIS: Mm-hmm.
I've got kids with problems.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.900
I can't stay anywhere for more
than five minutes.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.700
Right, Gabbana?
>> KHLOE: What kid has a problem

13:26.700 --> 13:28.633
now?
>> KRIS: Oh, all of you.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.433
It's just wild.
>> KHLOE: I don't have a

13:30.433 --> 13:32.166
problem.
>> KRIS: Swear to God, I'm gonna

13:32.166 --> 13:34.133
lock myself in a funny farm.
>> KHLOE: I haven't had a

13:34.133 --> 13:36.133
problem, I think, in a minute.
>> KRIS: Thank God.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.133
Is that better?
Is that...? I can't.

13:38.133 --> 13:39.934
>> KHLOE: Yeah.
>> KRIS: This mirror's a little

13:39.934 --> 13:41.667
fuzzy.
It's either that, or my...

13:41.667 --> 13:43.600
>> KHLOE: It's an antique
mirror.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.433
>> KRIS: Oh. Like, I thought it
was my eyesight.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.266
>> KHLOE: No, it's an antique
mirror.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.967
>> KRIS: Thank God.
>> KHLOE: "The mirror's fuzzy."

13:49.967 --> 13:53.967
>> KRIS: So... you know, there's
just a lot going on.

13:53.967 --> 13:59.600
It's Rob and the whole custody
thing, and... just settling, and

13:59.600 --> 14:03.233
it's just wild, wild, uh...
>> KHLOE: You're just stressed

14:03.233 --> 14:05.000
out.
>> KRIS: It's stressful because,

14:05.000 --> 14:09.967
at the end of the day, you know,
I'm trying to help him navigate

14:09.967 --> 14:11.967
this, because he's never gone
through anything like this

14:11.967 --> 14:13.834
before.
>> KHLOE: I mean, I totally get

14:13.834 --> 14:16.233
that it feels like it's pouring,
and all this  is

14:16.233 --> 14:19.700
happening, but you can't let it
consume you, and you got to

14:19.700 --> 14:21.667
just, like, smile and still
enjoy life.

14:21.667 --> 14:25.867
Like, you can't let these things
just ruin your day or make you

14:25.867 --> 14:27.867
feel this overwhelmed and
stressed out.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.300
>> KRIS: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: Got to laugh a little.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.133
>> KRIS: Right now, it doesn't
feel funny.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.967
It just feels like...
>> KHLOE: No, you don't have to

14:35.967 --> 14:37.967
think some...
funny.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.266
Like, that's serious, but, like,
we got to... move on.

14:40.266 --> 14:42.734
>> KRIS: Hello.

14:42.734 --> 14:47.266
going on?

14:47.266 --> 14:50.734
Ah, .
Okay, I'll be right there.

14:50.734 --> 14:53.667
All right, Khloe, I'm sorry.
>> KHLOE: Are you okay?

14:53.667 --> 14:55.700
>> KRIS: I got to go.
>> KHLOE: Are you okay?

14:55.700 --> 15:00.033
>> KRIS: No.
>> KHLOE: I know that my mom is

15:00.033 --> 15:02.734
under so much pressure, and I
feel like there's so much on her

15:02.734 --> 15:06.333
plate, and I could tell that
she's slowly cracking and

15:06.333 --> 15:08.567
crumbling.
She just doesn't know how to

15:08.567 --> 15:10.567
filter through all this
bull.

15:10.567 --> 15:17.533
Well, can I help you with
anything?

15:17.533 --> 15:20.333
>> KOURTNEY: I'm going on a
trip.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.467
>> CICI: Oh, would the kids go
on the trip?

15:22.467 --> 15:25.567
>> KOURTNEY: No.
>> CICI: You don't want them to

15:25.567 --> 15:29.700
always think you're getting up
and going.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.734
I don't.
>> KHLOE: I watched this show.

15:31.734 --> 15:34.967
It's a prank show.
This guy had to be handcuffed

15:34.967 --> 15:39.000
to a mime for 24 hours.
And what an obnoxious, fabulous

15:39.000 --> 15:40.934
prank is this to do to Mom?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.900
>> KHLOE: My mom has a crazy,
wild sense of humor.

15:54.900 --> 15:59.333
She's just hysterical.
She's the life of the party.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.600
>> KRIS: Oh.

16:01.600 --> 16:06.166
>> KHLOE: Mom!
>> KRIS: Oh! Oh! Oh!

16:06.166 --> 16:09.266
>> KHLOE: I feel like lately,

16:09.266 --> 16:11.300
she's all about business.
What does she have to do?

16:11.300 --> 16:13.633
She's in, she's out.
Like, everything's super serious

16:13.633 --> 16:16.667
and a little more dark, and I
just want her to get back to

16:16.667 --> 16:19.834
her old, awesome self.
>> KOURTNEY: Honey Bun Buns.

16:19.834 --> 16:22.567
>> KHLOE: You're free!
I know you don't watch a lot of

16:22.567 --> 16:25.400
TV, but do you ever watch, like,
prank shows?

16:25.400 --> 16:27.667
>> KOURTNEY: Prank shows? No.
>> KHLOE: Just, like...

16:27.667 --> 16:29.467
>> KOURTNEY: You know I don't
watch television at all.

16:29.467 --> 16:31.467
>> KHLOE: Well, anyway.
>> KOURTNEY: I don't.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.700
>> KHLOE: I watched this show.
It's a prank show.

16:33.700 --> 16:37.834
Impractical Jokers,
and it's, like, these four guys

16:37.834 --> 16:41.133
who've been, like, best friends
forever, and the premise of the

16:41.133 --> 16:43.300
show is, they basically have to,
like, humiliate each other.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.300
So, anyway, one of the
punishments was...

16:45.300 --> 16:47.500
>> KOURTNEY: Honey?
>> KHLOE: ...that this guy had

16:47.500 --> 16:51.800
to be handcuffed to a mime for
24 hours, and I just thought,

16:51.800 --> 16:55.500
what an obnoxious, fabulous
prank is this to do to Mom.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.867
Have her...
>> KOURTNEY: Get a mime?

16:57.867 --> 16:59.500
mime.
I want this...

16:59.500 --> 17:01.500
I've never seen a mime...
>> KOURTNEY: You want the same

17:01.500 --> 17:03.500
mime from the show?
>> KHLOE: ...be this legendary.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.633
Yes.
I've already reached out to his

17:07.633 --> 17:10.266
manager, and he's so down for
this.

17:10.266 --> 17:13.066
He doesn't speak on the phone--
only through management.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.500
Love him even more.
And he's so excited to have a

17:15.500 --> 17:17.967
fun day with my mom.
And hopefully he could break her

17:17.967 --> 17:20.967
out of her stiff funk.
>> KOURTNEY: Don't tell her the

17:20.967 --> 17:23.033
plan.
>> KHLOE: No, you moron, we're

17:23.033 --> 17:26.200
showing up with the mime.
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, what... I think

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
you should just, like, say we're
having dinner and we have a

17:28.200 --> 17:30.200
special guest that we want her
to meet.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
>> KHLOE: And then just handcuff
them?

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
>> KOURTNEY: But what? Is she
gonna... Why would she agree to

17:34.200 --> 17:35.867
have a mime...
>> KHLOE: She's not gonna agree.

17:35.867 --> 17:38.000
We just do it.
When would she agree to any of

17:38.000 --> 17:39.400
this?
She takes herself too seriously.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.600
>> KOURTNEY: So, what, do we say
there's a guest at the door?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.600
>> KHLOE: We got to figure that
part out.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.900
We're just gonna be like, "Yo,
you take yourself so seriously,

17:46.900 --> 17:49.467
and, like, let's have fun."
I think this is just... I mean,

17:49.467 --> 17:52.200
she'll definitely kill us.
Well, whoever's affiliated.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.934
Me, most likely.
It's just, like, fun to

17:54.934 --> 17:57.533
with her.

17:57.533 --> 18:00.834
Oh, yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: My guard dog.

18:00.834 --> 18:04.200
>> KHLOE: Get it, Honey.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
>> KIM : Love you,
Mom!

18:06.200 --> 18:08.400
>> KRIS : Love
you, too, Kimmy.

18:08.400 --> 18:14.667
♪ ♪
>> KHLOE: Oh, my gosh.

18:14.667 --> 18:19.066
You just want to be free!
Oh, she's such a cute dog.

18:19.066 --> 18:22.900
>> KOURTNEY: Chonch.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.900
>> CICI: Hi! How are you?
>> KOURTNEY: Hi!

18:26.900 --> 18:29.734
>> CICI: Hi! What are you doing?
>> KOURTNEY: I'm sitting here

18:29.734 --> 18:32.100
with Khloe.
>> CICI: How are you?

18:32.100 --> 18:34.100
>> KHLOE: I'm good. How are you?
>> KOURTNEY: How are you

18:34.100 --> 18:37.033
feeling?
>> CICI: Mm, better, thank you.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.500
>> KOURTNEY: Good.
>> CICI: So what's new?

18:40.500 --> 18:43.633
>> KOURTNEY: I'm going on a
trip.

18:43.633 --> 18:45.700
>> CICI: Okay. Where?
>> KOURTNEY: To Egypt.

18:45.700 --> 18:49.133
>> CICI: Okay. Would the kids go
on the trip?

18:49.133 --> 18:51.600
>> KOURTNEY: No, I was just
gonna go with Simon and my

18:51.600 --> 18:56.266
friends.
>> CICI: Well, for how long?

18:56.266 --> 18:59.166
>> KOURTNEY: For, like, seven
days.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.867
>> CICI: That's a long time.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah. It is.

19:02.867 --> 19:04.867
>> CICI: You don't want them to
always think you're getting up

19:04.867 --> 19:07.600
and going.
>> KOURTNEY: No. Especially

19:07.600 --> 19:10.333
since I didn't for so long,
you know?

19:10.333 --> 19:14.633
>> CICI: Right. But that's
probably what, you know, helps

19:14.633 --> 19:17.233
them keep grounded, is that you
are there.

19:17.233 --> 19:20.367
And even though you work and
they know that, you know, you're

19:20.367 --> 19:22.700
there.
But when you're not there, it's

19:22.700 --> 19:24.867
a void.
And you don't want them, at a

19:24.867 --> 19:29.100
young age, to feel a void.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

19:29.100 --> 19:33.667
>> CICI: You know, our greatest
gift is our stability from our

19:33.667 --> 19:37.600
family, is our togetherness and
the presence that gives us our

19:37.600 --> 19:39.734
strength.
>> KOURTNEY: And I think it's

19:39.734 --> 19:43.967
frustrating to me, to have my
co-parenting partner, who's not,

19:43.967 --> 19:49.367
like, you know, fully reliable.
>> CICI: Yeah, no, of course it

19:49.367 --> 19:52.333
is, 'cause your children, you
know, are the most important

19:52.333 --> 19:57.934
things in your life.
Uh, I think you should stay at

19:57.934 --> 20:01.433
home.
>> KOURTNEY: I already feel like

20:01.433 --> 20:05.834
I'm having separation anxiety
when it comes to leaving my

20:05.834 --> 20:12.433
kids, and Cici is making the
situation worse.

20:12.433 --> 20:17.400
All right. Well...
>> CICI: Keep me posted.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.533
>> KOURTNEY: M'kay.
I'll call you later.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.433
>> CICI: Okay. Love you.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.467
>> KRIS: Everything... the
pictures look so beautiful.

42:06.467 --> 42:09.066
I can't even imagine what it
would be like to be inside of a

42:09.066 --> 42:13.266
pyramid.
>> KOURTNEY: So insane.

42:13.266 --> 42:16.533
>> KRIS: Right?
>> KOURTNEY: I've definitely

42:16.533 --> 42:20.433
learned from, you know, my past
relationship, where I really

42:20.433 --> 42:23.233
wouldn't travel without the
kids.

42:23.233 --> 42:26.967
And I think it is important to
take time, especially because my

42:26.967 --> 42:31.266
relationship is important to me
and just because those worlds

42:31.266 --> 42:35.834
aren't colliding right now, just
making sure that I make time

42:35.834 --> 42:40.200
for both.
And I think going on a trip once

42:40.200 --> 42:45.133
in a while reminds me the
importance of being present and

42:45.133 --> 42:50.033
in the moment when I'm home.
And I think it makes me the best

42:50.033 --> 42:55.300
mom that I can be.
Reigny-Reignoosh.

42:55.300 --> 42:58.467
Yummy.
>> KRIS: Wait!

42:58.467 --> 43:00.867
P!
Here's this one.

43:00.867 --> 43:02.867
>> PENELOPE: Hi, Mom.
>> KOURTNEY:  You look

43:02.867 --> 43:05.767
so beautiful.
>> PENELOPE: Love you.

43:05.767 --> 43:11.734
>> KOURTNEY: I love you guys.
>> KRIS: Love you, Kourt.

43:11.734 --> 43:14.367
>> KIM: On the next episode...
>> KRIS: I have the biggest

43:14.367 --> 43:18.633
earlobes in the universe.
I have made a decision to do

43:18.633 --> 43:22.033
something about my ears.
Oh, my God.

43:22.033 --> 43:24.233
>> KHLOE: Corey was doing
anything in his power to avoid

43:24.233 --> 43:27.467
me.
>> KRIS: If that energy is out

43:27.467 --> 43:30.333
there, it's not okay with me.
>> COREY: I'm a young dude

43:30.333 --> 43:32.700
dating y'all mom.
Y'all are not my ing

43:32.700 --> 43:34.700
kids.
>> TRISTAN: Thank you guys for

43:34.700 --> 43:38.433
all coming.
We have an announcement. KoKo?
