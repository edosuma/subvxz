00:17.226 --> 00:20.103
Thank you so much for
designing my outfit
for the hip‐hop show.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.439
Of course! Our pleasure.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.650
You're gonna be so wicked
on my web show.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.485
You're saying "wicked."
I like that.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.153
Wicked's good now, right?

00:28.153 --> 00:29.988
Of course it is.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.699
‐I just have one question
for you guys.
‐Evie: What's up?

00:32.699 --> 00:35.160
Why are we making my dress
in a science lab?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.621
Great fashion
is cutting‐edge.

00:37.621 --> 00:40.165
‐Right...
‐So what's more cutting edge

00:40.165 --> 00:42.125
than creating
chemical compounds?

00:42.125 --> 00:45.295
‐Uhh...
‐You guys said that you
wanted to look fierce, right?

00:45.295 --> 00:46.588
Super fierce!

00:46.588 --> 00:48.173
But also welcoming.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.133
That's us!
Fiercely welcoming.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.260
Mal: What do you think?

00:51.260 --> 00:53.845
Jordan: I like it, but...

00:53.845 --> 00:56.181
I think we can make it
even fiercer.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.599
‐And friendlier.
‐Mal: You know what?

00:57.599 --> 00:59.893
I think we have
just the thing. Evie?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.561
Lonnie: Nuclear waist?

01:01.561 --> 01:04.147
No! Well, not anymore.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.733
This is gonna make
your dress glow in the dark.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.193
Dark, light.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.695
Mal: What is more
fiercely‐friendly than that?

01:09.695 --> 01:10.988
I love it.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.990
You want me to
perform in the dark?

01:12.990 --> 01:14.241
Evie: Trust us.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.160
With this stuff,
you'll bring the house down.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.620
Or burn it down.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.290
Evie: Just stay way
from liquid nitrogen.

‐Okay, that's too much.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.181
I have sensitive ear drums.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.267
I might be dropping the mic
on the stage...

01:43.186 --> 01:46.815
but Lonnie's about to
drop the mic on y'all!
