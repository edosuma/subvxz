00:06.006 --> 00:08.591
[upbeat jazz playing]

00:29.446 --> 00:31.239
[Antoni] Let's go!

00:31.322 --> 00:32.699
[Karamo] Oh, they're here!

00:32.782 --> 00:35.118
-[Bobby] I comin'!
-[Jonathan] Yeah!

00:35.201 --> 00:37.120
-Dorian, this is our home.
-It's beautiful.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.496
Ain't it pretty?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.248
-[Karamo] Hi!
-[Tan] Yeah!

00:40.331 --> 00:42.042
-Hello!
-Hello!

00:42.125 --> 00:43.835
-Hi!
-You gorgeous lady.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.295
-Isn't she?
-[Dorian] Thank you!

00:45.378 --> 00:47.213
-So psyched you're here!
-[Bobby] Hi, gorgeous.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.257
-I'm Bobby.
-[Antoni] Nice to meet you, Dorian.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.135
-[Jonathan] Thanks for coming.
-[Karamo] Come. Come sit. Come sit.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.344
-Dorian!
-Yes.

00:53.428 --> 00:56.056
We are so excited to hear
about your mum, Doreen.

00:56.139 --> 01:00.060
We hear that at the end of the week,
she's being honored at the Jazz Museum.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.811
Yeah. She doesn't know that,

01:01.895 --> 01:05.190
but no one deserves this more than my mom.

01:05.273 --> 01:08.109
Apparently, she's a New Orleans treasure.
Tell us about her.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.321
-She's a clarinetist and a vocalist.
-[Jonathan] Yes, clarinetist!

01:11.404 --> 01:13.531
Her band is called
Doreen's Jazz New Orleans.

01:13.615 --> 01:17.994
It's here in the French Quarter.
It feels like you're at a party 24/7.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.164
[Doreen] I got a bunch of nicknames.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.832
Queen Clarinet,

01:23.625 --> 01:25.126
Lady Louis,

01:25.210 --> 01:26.377
Miss Satchmo,

01:26.461 --> 01:28.046
the Female Louis Armstrong.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.923
That's really cool, you know?

01:30.006 --> 01:33.676
Because I just was influenced by Louis,

01:33.760 --> 01:36.221
but clarinet is the bomb.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.057
She was originally a classical musician

01:39.140 --> 01:42.477
until she met the tuba player,
aka my father,

01:42.560 --> 01:44.771
and he converted her to jazz.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.231
[guys] Ah.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.692
[Doreen] Before classes, we'd practice.
After classes, we'd practice.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.321
That was my ideal woman,
'cause music was my life,

01:53.404 --> 01:56.324
and she was into what I was into.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.575
[Doreen] Before long,

01:57.659 --> 02:02.455
man, we were just making money
and having fun and traveling.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.794
[Dorian] She's performed
with the Philharmonic Orchestra two times.

02:07.877 --> 02:11.172
And every time I see her perform there,
I started crying.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.591
-So music is part of your family.
-Yeah.

02:13.675 --> 02:17.345
-I'm the drummer actually.
-[Bobby] I was like, "Is that you?"

02:17.428 --> 02:18.596
-[laughing]
-[Dorian] Mm-hmm.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.599
[Doreen] Sometimes I can't even look back
at either of 'em

02:21.683 --> 02:27.438
because I just get full inside
and lose my concentration, so to speak.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.858
So your mom sounds amazing.
Why would you nominate her?

02:29.941 --> 02:32.152
So I've been playing my whole life,

02:32.235 --> 02:35.446
and it's something
that I don't wanna continue.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.574
-What?
-You are breaking up the band.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.577
-No! I don't know if we should do this!
-[Tan] Does your mom know?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.078
Yeah, my mom knows.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.204
Oh, she does?

02:43.288 --> 02:46.082
Sorry, I freaked out
and got, like, Karen, like, mom.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.625
-[Dorian] No!
-I freaked out. Sorry.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.211
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

02:50.295 --> 02:53.131
-I had this with her already. It's fine.
-[Jonathan] I'm sorry.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.508
[Dorian] You know,
she's not gonna play the streets forever.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.677
She can't go out there
and move all the time

02:57.760 --> 02:59.429
and set everything up.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.639
-It takes a lot of strength.
-Okay.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.600
Time for her to get ready
for her next chapter.

03:03.683 --> 03:07.770
Yes, it is, and I just wanna give her
something to continue on.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.232
So the sweet shop
is something that her mom had.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.400
[guys] Oh.

03:12.483 --> 03:16.905
[Dorian] I know she wants to continue that
for her mom, as well as for herself.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.658
[Doreen]
My family started Doreen's Sweet Shop.

03:20.742 --> 03:24.037
It was a successful business
in the Tremé for decades

03:24.120 --> 03:26.456
and my mother's dream.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.542
You could see it in her.
You could hear it in her voice.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.586
Just such a sense of pride.

03:32.086 --> 03:36.216
When she stopped working it,
I wasn't ready to take it over,

03:36.299 --> 03:37.842
and the music was calling me.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.886
It's just what I wanted to do so much.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.930
So we closed the sweet shop.

03:42.013 --> 03:46.351
I said, "After a little while,
we'll open the sweet shop back up,"

03:46.434 --> 03:50.355
because it's for me
to keep the legacy going.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.357
But life happens.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.983
[Tan] This is the old sweet shop.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.152
-[Karamo] That's amazing.
-The sign is lovely. So cute.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.071
Yes, it's named after her.
Doreen's Sweet Shop.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.197
[Bobby] Aw.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.282
[Dorian] Everybody in the neighborhood
would go there

04:01.366 --> 04:03.868
on their way to school,
to grab a snack, stuff like that,

04:03.952 --> 04:06.537
but Katrina really
put, like, it into the ground.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.664
-[Tan] Oh.
-Wow.

04:08.665 --> 04:12.085
[Doreen] It just turned into a few months
and then a few years,

04:12.168 --> 04:15.505
and now it's in shambles,

04:15.588 --> 04:20.468
and the mountain
is getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.513
[Dorian] The sweet shop
is part of her life,

04:23.596 --> 04:27.058
and it's very important to do it right now
to have something to fall back on.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.559
Music is their job.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.728
-It's more of her retirement plan.
-[Dorian] Yes.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.646
Okay. Okay.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.607
[Karamo] At the end of the week,
the New Orleans City Council

04:34.691 --> 04:36.567
is making her a cultural ambassador?

04:36.651 --> 04:40.613
Yeah, like, she is someone
that has made this world a better place,

04:40.697 --> 04:42.949
and she deserves both legacies.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.909
The way you speak about your mom
is beautiful.

04:44.993 --> 04:48.413
-Yes, I love that lady. Come on now!
-[Jonathan] I can't wait to meet her!

04:48.496 --> 04:51.708
Do you have the keys? It sounds like
I'm gonna need a little extra time.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.334
-[Dorian] Sure.
-There are a lot of keys.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.045
You're gonna have figure out
which key goes for which lock.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.297
-We'll take you out.
-My gosh!

04:57.380 --> 04:59.882
[Jonathan] We love.
Thanks for coming, Dorian!

04:59.966 --> 05:01.801
-Come.
-[Dorian] Thank you guys so much.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.469
-[Bobby] Bye, love.
-Thank you, Dorian.

What the heck? What the heck?

-[Doreen] Oh my goodness!

06:23.716 --> 06:25.718
[jazz playing]

06:35.103 --> 06:37.105
This is biblical.

06:37.188 --> 06:41.526
It's no wonder why she is referred to
as the Queen of the Clarinet.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.945
You spend one minute in Doreen's presence,

06:44.028 --> 06:46.948
and you will know you're listening
to one of the greats.

06:47.031 --> 06:52.412
She is exactly what you wanna hear
when you roll into New Orleans.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.254
[cheering]

07:03.714 --> 07:05.842
That is so amazing!

07:05.925 --> 07:07.718
[Karamo] You are amazing!

07:07.802 --> 07:11.514
Yes! Give her your money, you guys.
That was so good!

07:11.597 --> 07:13.599
That's so cool! [laughs]

07:13.683 --> 07:16.352
So you're Lawrence?
Oh my God! You're so cute!

07:16.436 --> 07:17.895
-Hello.
-How are you?

07:17.979 --> 07:20.606
-Can we steal you? Can come with us?
-[Karamo] I know it's raining.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.484
Come to me.
It's not a wet T-shirt contest.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.777
[upbeat music playing]

07:24.861 --> 07:27.321
-[Karamo] Love that.
-Lawrence, you hold down the fort.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.658
-It ain't nothing without her.
-[Jonathan] Just a light drizzle!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.244
We already have an adventure
with you already, honey!

07:33.327 --> 07:34.162
We really did.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.456
Oh, my goodness gracious. This is so cool.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.957
Really? Oh.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.083
Yes, really.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.710
[Doreen laughs]

07:41.836 --> 07:44.338
When you're busking,
do people kind of stake out places,

07:44.422 --> 07:46.841
and it's like "Do not come to my place!
This is my place"?

07:46.924 --> 07:48.634
Oh yeah. We used to have to camp out.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.345
We used to actually come out
on a Thursday night.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.222
And we wouldn't leave
until Sunday evening.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.933
-To make sure you had your space.
-Yeah. Yeah. Thank God.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.268
Been there, done that.

07:57.351 --> 08:01.230
We tried to play on this corner here,
but whoever owns that store there,

08:01.314 --> 08:04.233
they didn't like us,
and they didn't want any music at all.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.819
Roll your window down,
and be like, "Big mistake. Huge."

08:06.903 --> 08:08.237
[laughs] I love that.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.614
-I love that movie.
-Right?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.491
-Oh my God, Julia Roberts.
-Who doesn't?

08:11.574 --> 08:15.077
[Doreen] People have a tendency
to not respect you as a street musician.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.662
And… and people try to save you.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.624
Oh my God,
the people who've tried to save us!

08:19.707 --> 08:20.958
[laughing] I mean, like, wow.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.752
-Really?
-[Doreen] Trying to tell you.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.588
Um, can we talk
about how cute your neighborhood is?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.798
-Your neighborhood's adore.
-Oh man.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.426
When we first knew
we were gonna close on the house,

08:30.510 --> 08:32.053
I brought my mom, and she says…

08:32.136 --> 08:34.430
-"This is nice."
-…"Oh, this is a nice neighborhood."

08:34.514 --> 08:36.599
"Do colored folks
live on this neighborhood?"

08:36.682 --> 08:39.185
-They do now.
-They do now! That's exactly what I said.

08:39.268 --> 08:42.313
-[Bobby] That's right.
-[Doreen] That's right. She'd say, "Ooh!"

08:42.396 --> 08:43.773
[Tan] What a lovely home.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.982
Thank you.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.401
-Hi, gorgeous.
-[Dorian] How are you doing?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.278
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you again.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.697
[Jonathan]
Your bleach and tone, Dorian. Honey!

08:51.781 --> 08:53.407
-It's giving.
-Oh my gosh!

08:53.491 --> 08:54.325
Y'all met her!

08:54.408 --> 08:57.036
Why am I getting wafts
of, like, vanilla and caramel?

08:57.119 --> 08:59.288
-Something smells good.
-Wait right here.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.959
There's a smell of chocolate and vanilla,
and I'm not sure what else,

09:03.042 --> 09:04.919
but someone's been baking something.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.421
If these are sweets,
we're gonna lose our mind!

09:07.505 --> 09:10.675
-Does everybody like brownies?
-What do you think we are, monsters?

09:10.758 --> 09:12.260
There's brownies?

09:13.094 --> 09:13.928
Oh my God!

09:15.263 --> 09:16.305
Don't do it!

09:19.350 --> 09:20.851
Ew!

09:20.935 --> 09:21.852
How dare you!

09:24.105 --> 09:25.022
[Karamo] Brown Es.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.607
[laughs]

09:26.691 --> 09:28.818
[Karamo] Why would you tease us like this?

09:28.901 --> 09:31.779
I did this to someone yesterday.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.824
I felt to so bad till I made brownies.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.036
-[Jonathan] So there is brownies?
-[Bobby] Speaking of fabulous things…

09:39.120 --> 09:40.538
[Doreen] Ta-da!

09:40.621 --> 09:44.041
-So this is, um…
-[Jonathan] Oh my God!

09:44.125 --> 09:46.168
-…cream cheese. [laughs]
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.547
Mmm. Get in Mommy's mouth.
Right in my belly.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.965
Cheers, Tanny!

09:51.048 --> 09:52.258
They're so nice, right?

09:52.341 --> 09:54.510
[Karamo] You know he's happy
when he starts twerkin'.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.470
Twerk it! Twerk it! Twerk it!

09:56.554 --> 09:59.265
-[laughing]
-Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

09:59.348 --> 10:02.226
I am the Cookie Monster.
I'm Queer Cookie Monster.

10:02.310 --> 10:06.063
Oh my God!

10:06.147 --> 10:07.898
-Look at you.
-I know, man.

10:07.982 --> 10:08.816
Honey!

10:08.899 --> 10:10.026
Wow.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.861
Look at this amazing painting of you.

10:12.361 --> 10:17.575
There is history and music
in every single corner of this house.

10:17.658 --> 10:21.287
I feel like music is something that
really does bring people together, right?

10:21.370 --> 10:24.248
And food kind of has
that same power as well.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.374
Yes. That's true.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.460
I feel like you're like me.
You're a dreamer.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.962
You have all these different things
that you wanna do,

10:30.046 --> 10:32.506
but I wanna hone in
on something that's really important…

10:32.590 --> 10:34.300
-Passionate about.
-…that you wanna make.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.886
What do you think about
when you're dreaming about the candy shop?

10:36.969 --> 10:38.846
Well, the first version was…

10:38.929 --> 10:40.806
-[Antoni] Your face is lighting up.
-Yeah. Yeah.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.434
'Cause, you know, with the sweet shop,
I learned how to bake,

10:43.517 --> 10:46.812
and my mom just thought about
what the kids would want.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.148
-So I still wanna cater to the kids too.
-Of course.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.983
And I wanna amp it up a bit

10:51.067 --> 10:54.487
with some, you know,
signature, uh, baked goods,

10:54.570 --> 10:56.238
-like puff pastries.
-Mm.

10:56.322 --> 11:01.494
I noticed you just raid the refrigerator,
and you put it inside a puff pastry.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.828
That's the great thing about it!

11:02.912 --> 11:05.581
You can make it sweet, savory,
a mix of both.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.541
There's nothing that doesn't taste…

11:07.625 --> 11:10.544
Well, maybe not nothing,
but goodness gracious.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.048
We haven't really figured out
that flavor profile yet,

11:14.131 --> 11:15.299
but I'm here to tell you,

11:15.383 --> 11:17.468
oh my goodness, when I figure it out, mmm…

11:17.551 --> 11:20.179
That's something
we can have a lot of fun with this week.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.347
Cool.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.390
Ooh.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.475
What's down here? Ooh.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.269
[Tan] Doreen,
shall we go check out your closet?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.646
I'm actually packed,

11:28.729 --> 11:31.148
you know, 'cause we're coming
from somewhere or going.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.692
Where is that suitcase?

11:35.027 --> 11:36.195
-Oh my.
-Yep.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.571
-[Tan] You are packed.
-[laughs]

11:37.655 --> 11:39.740
-Let me help you with that.
-[Doreen] Thank you, sir.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.285
Before you sit down,
do you moonlight as a janitor?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.413
[laughing]

11:45.496 --> 11:47.540
[plodding music playing]

11:47.623 --> 11:51.752
-No!
-Why do you carry keys on a keychain?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.838
-I know.
-How many carabiners do you have?

11:53.921 --> 11:55.756
[Doreen]
The reason they're separate is because

11:55.840 --> 11:58.217
the ignition of the car
doesn't like the weight.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.303
Mmm. Go on. Spin for me.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.890
[Doreen] All right,
so there are house locks outside.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.559
There are house locks inside.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.269
There are sweet-shop locks.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.855
There are padlocks that we use for work.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.482
-Yeah.
-It's a lot. Sit down, Doreen, please.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.400
Okay.

12:14.483 --> 12:15.735
Denim jacket.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.611
I'm not mad at a denim jacket.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.948
That shirt is older than Dorian,
and I absolutely love it.

12:21.031 --> 12:24.535
This is a crime scene.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.538
-No. No.
-[laughs]

12:27.621 --> 12:28.622
[Tan] Doreen's spunky.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.459
She's fun. She's vibrant. She's energetic.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.044
-No. No.
-[laughs]

12:34.128 --> 12:35.171
These clothes…

12:35.254 --> 12:38.048
-The greatest no I've said in a long time.
-Oh my God!

12:38.132 --> 12:39.467
…are just blah.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.885
Absolutely no.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.387
Have you lost your damn mind?

12:43.471 --> 12:45.473
It is not okay.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.641
Do you feel good in this?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.603
I mean, even if somebody comes up

12:50.686 --> 12:52.938
and they're like,
"Look at the way she's dressed,"

12:53.022 --> 12:56.525
I start playing and they're like,
"Oh my goodness gracious!" so I'm good.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.986
But wouldn't you like to look nice?

12:59.069 --> 13:00.821
[Doreen] Oh, now, let me tell you.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.325
There are some heavier women,
like, on television.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.244
-[Tan] Yeah.
-And I'm like, "Wow."

13:07.328 --> 13:09.413
But I'm… I can't do that.
You know what I mean?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.706
Why can't you?

13:11.373 --> 13:12.750
You can look great.

13:12.833 --> 13:16.128
I wanna show you how easy it can be.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.215
Oh my God. That's like… Thank you.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.467
[suspenseful music playing]

13:21.550 --> 13:23.219
Holy shit. Mmm.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.554
[Jonathan] Oh my God.
Okay. Tell me everything.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.515
What's your self-care routine like?

13:27.598 --> 13:31.227
-I wash my face, I brush my teeth, and…
-[Jonathan] Yes. Check, check.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.521
-…I'm good.
-[Jonathan] And we're good to go.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.815
'Cause I do the hair,
and it lasts for a while.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.525
-Yes.
-So I don't have to worry about that.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.569
So is that kind of
where the inspo for the braids came from?

13:40.653 --> 13:43.447
It's like… it's low-maintenance,
it looks chic.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.907
Yeah, convenience for sure.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.743
And I don't really worry
about the makeup thing,

13:47.827 --> 13:49.829
but, boy, when Dorian makes me up.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.622
I mean, look at your face.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.334
-Your face is stunning.
-Oh.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.795
I remember the first time
she put eyelashes on me.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.548
-I'm, like, "Oh man!"
-These eyes!

14:00.631 --> 14:02.758
I just felt queen-ish.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.593
-[Jonathan] I love feeling queen-ish.
-Oh man.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.971
Do you ever want any of that glam
in your daily?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.181
Would you wanna learn
how to do a little of it?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.099
Heck yeah.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.811
[Karamo] Hi, gorgeous.

14:13.894 --> 14:14.895
Hello, handsome.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.190
When I look at you,
all I see is just pure talent.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.275
Really?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.277
How does it feel
to know you're living a life

14:21.360 --> 14:23.696
where you just make so many people
feel happy?

14:23.779 --> 14:24.738
Well…

14:27.032 --> 14:28.409
Thank you. I just found out.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.119
[both laugh]

14:30.202 --> 14:31.495
-You are!
-That's so cool.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.830
-[Karamo] You are!
-Well…

14:32.913 --> 14:34.331
When we were driving here,

14:34.415 --> 14:38.460
you'd said how many people try to save you
because you're a street performer.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.670
Yeah. Yep.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.590
When people don't get to know you,
they assume things.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.507
Yep.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.675
You know, they say,

14:44.758 --> 14:47.595
"Well, they're on the street,
so must be a drug problem."

14:47.678 --> 14:49.430
"Must be some kind of alcohol problem."

14:49.513 --> 14:51.265
We've been blacklisted for a long time

14:51.348 --> 14:53.976
from really nice club gigs and stuff,
you know?

14:54.059 --> 14:57.354
The people that hire, they don't see
the legacy that you've created.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.439
Yeah, it's a trip,

14:58.522 --> 15:01.191
but, you know,
we're just doing what we love to do.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.569
Yeah. You ever feel worn down
and tired sometimes?

15:03.652 --> 15:07.072
[scoffs] Yes, indeed. You know,
I used to love traveling,

15:07.156 --> 15:09.033
but now, the walks through the airport…

15:09.116 --> 15:10.242
Airports are huge!

15:10.326 --> 15:12.244
-Aren't they?
-[laughs] They're so huge!

15:12.328 --> 15:14.079
-And oh man.
-You ain't gotta tell me, girl.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.999
I hit 41, I said,
"Girl, what's going on with these knees?"

15:17.082 --> 15:19.043
-"What's happening?"
-Oh, 41? Oh, Lord.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.169
As I said, I'm a baby.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.714
I do… I recognize it,
but the effects is coming in.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.007
-They coming.
-Yeah.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.676
Forty-one came, and my eyes changed.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.013
-And I'm like, "Whoa. Here it is."
-Okay.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.432
-"We're in it." Oh shit.
-"We're in it!" "We're in it."

15:33.515 --> 15:36.101
I mean, I'm not gonna say
downhill since then, but…

15:36.185 --> 15:38.479
-No, you going up.
-…you know, amplified, for sure.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.773
Emotionally, what are you feeling?

15:42.232 --> 15:46.195
Even when I'm overwhelmed,
it's like I'm not complaining,

15:46.278 --> 15:51.033
because it's better to be overwhelmed,
you know, because you have so much to do

15:51.116 --> 15:54.411
than to have nothing to do, so I'm good.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.704
I just have to catch up.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.540
-You thrive in your passion.
-That's a good way of saying it.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.042
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.253
[Tan] Ant, you're down to your
final three! Come on, you can do this!

16:05.839 --> 16:08.217
-[Doreen] Hey.
-Hi, lady.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.426
Almost there!

16:09.969 --> 16:10.886
Ah! [laughs]

16:11.637 --> 16:13.931
I'm sorry! My fingers went in your mouth!

16:16.976 --> 16:20.813
So your lovely daughter
has given me some photos.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.606
Is that your mama?

16:22.690 --> 16:24.942
-[Doreen] That's my mom. That's Anna May.
-[Bobby] Yeah.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.193
Yeah, that's my girl.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.488
My mom went
from cleaning up people's houses

16:29.571 --> 16:32.908
to having her own successful business
for decades.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.952
-[Bobby] She's beautiful.
-Mm-hmm. Mmm. Yep.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.578
Doreen's Sweet Shop.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.958
My dad did some work in it, you know,
and put it together and put a counter up

16:41.041 --> 16:42.167
and the kids would come.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.920
And they would just line up
and just go up there,

16:45.004 --> 16:47.089
and my mom was so nice.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.758
You know? "Hi, dear. May I help you?"
You know?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.510
And it stayed open for how long?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.096
-Thirty-five years.
-Wow.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.099
So it was
absolutely a neighborhood staple.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.350
Yeah. That was the joint.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.311
-It's a pretty amazing legacy.
-It is amazing. It is.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.189
But I didn't want it to end with them,
so we bought the building.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.359
-What year was that?
-That had to be 2002.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.778
So you guys have worked on it a bit
over the years?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.113
-[Doreen] Oh, heck yeah.
-Yeah.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.948
Heck yeah, and it's really a shame,

17:13.032 --> 17:15.200
because when Katrina came,

17:15.284 --> 17:17.494
three and a half feet of water. Boom.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.997
-And so everything had to come out then.
-Right.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.167
It's had so many things wrong
in so many ways

17:23.250 --> 17:24.835
and for so long.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.379
You wanna make it happen, but you can't.

17:27.463 --> 17:32.134
Life happens, and after a while, you know,
you just got a big pile of dreams.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.304
-I have already been in there working.
-[Doreen] Really?

17:35.387 --> 17:36.889
-Shall we go check it out?
-Okay.

17:36.972 --> 17:37.806
Yeah, let's do it.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.224
-Kids!
-[guys] Yeah?

17:39.308 --> 17:42.227
Kids, are y'all ready
to go to the sweet shop?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.520
[Jonathan] Yes!

17:45.522 --> 17:51.153
[Doreen] Tremé is the oldest
free Black neighborhood in the country.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.074
Here, there was a lady named Miss Dorothy.
She used to sit on the porch.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.242
And she'd know everything
about the neighborhood.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.204
I love the old women
that always know everyone's business.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.122
-She knew everything.
-Bobby, that's you.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.875
-[laughing]
-Hey, it'll be me one day. It will be me.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.960
We call them "curtain twitchers"
back home.

18:07.044 --> 18:07.961
[laughs]

18:08.045 --> 18:10.255
-You used to live here?
-Used to live right here.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.423
-Right here.
-Hi, house!

18:11.507 --> 18:13.300
-[Bobby] This is the candy shop.
-[Doreen] Yes.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.887
Right? I got the little magical elves
going on in here. Things are happening.

18:16.970 --> 18:21.642
Just hearing the echoes is just amazing
because there were no echoes before.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.559
[Bobby] Right?

18:22.643 --> 18:25.646
-It's been quiet for a while, right?
-Yeah, it's been very quiet.

18:25.729 --> 18:30.317
So I would love for you to go in
and see some progress already,

18:30.400 --> 18:31.610
but you can't.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.529
-I was like, "Oh, let's go."
-[laughs]

18:33.612 --> 18:36.198
Man, I feel like you just gave me
some brown Es!

18:36.281 --> 18:37.783
[laughs]

18:37.866 --> 18:39.827
Are you ready to get this week started?

18:39.910 --> 18:40.744
Heck yeah.

18:40.828 --> 18:41.995
[Karamo] Okay?

18:42.079 --> 18:45.207
[upbeat music playing]

18:45.290 --> 18:47.668
[Tan] At the end of this week,
the New Orleans City Council

18:47.751 --> 18:51.505
is gonna surprise Doreen
as a cultural ambassador of New Orleans,

18:51.588 --> 18:53.882
and I want her to feel incredible.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.259

I had to succeed at music,

-What you making?

28:45.515 --> 28:47.183
[Doreen]
I'mma make the most difficult one.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.978
-You're going through the hardest first?
-[Doreen] Yeah.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.855
[Antoni] Somehow that doesn't surprise me.

28:51.938 --> 28:56.651
So, Dorian, how do you feel
about the renaissance of the sweet shop?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.611
[Dorian] I'm excited
what she's gonna do with it,

28:58.695 --> 29:01.990
and what we're gonna be
spending all night working on.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.366
[Antoni] "We?" You're gonna help?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.702
I mean, yeah.
It's always fun cooking with her.

29:06.202 --> 29:09.205
We're best friends,
so, like, it's always a good time.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.458
[Antoni] That's such a sweet thing to say
about your mom.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.418
-We are. We're buddies, huh?
-That's my buddy.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.754
[Antoni] You love each other,
and you like each other.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.046
[Doreen] Very much so.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.923
-Look at it!
-That's beautiful.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.341
[Antoni] That is beautiful.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.761
-[Dorian] Oh my gosh.
-[Antoni] You're ready for your wash.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.097
-It feels weird putting raw egg on it.
-Yeah, that's why I'm like…

29:26.181 --> 29:28.266
It'll make sense
once it comes out of the oven.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.685
The sugar clings to the wash nicely.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.103
I love that.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.148
When I saw it,
I was like, "Oh, fresh dill at that?"

29:35.231 --> 29:36.316
"Goodness gracious."

29:36.399 --> 29:37.442
Mmm.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.610
[Antoni] That's very smart.

29:38.693 --> 29:42.530
Sometimes you wanna look at a cookbook
and follow the recipe step by step…

29:42.614 --> 29:44.407
I think I wanna do a berries and cream.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.243
…but then there's other days
you wanna play, have fun,

29:47.327 --> 29:49.871
you wanna be creative,
you wanna see what works.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.956
You just want to channel jazz.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.334
I'm gonna go ahead and put mine in.

29:54.417 --> 29:55.627
Oven's set at 400.

29:55.710 --> 29:58.588
It's going to be 15 to 17 minutes,
and they're going to be ready.

29:58.671 --> 30:00.006
Wow.

30:00.089 --> 30:04.677
[Antoni] I'm just so fascinated
at the fact that you live together,

30:04.761 --> 30:06.221
you work together.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.348
Is that what it was like for you, Doreen?

30:08.431 --> 30:10.934
-I was definitely a mama's girl.
-Were you?

30:11.017 --> 30:13.561
-I still am a mama's girl.
-Yeah, she still is.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.606
If you look back, and when I do look back,

30:16.689 --> 30:19.776
I mean, I was raised
behind the sweet shop, you know?

30:19.859 --> 30:23.196
So Doreen's Sweet Shop
is just full of memories.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.113
Right.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.616
My mom was in the shop most of the time,

30:26.699 --> 30:30.286
and I cooked in the sweet shop
before I started playing music.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.746
That's what made it great too.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.998
It was just wonderful just being with her.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.251
-Yeah.
-For sure.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.795
This sweet shop
brought so many happy moments

30:38.878 --> 30:40.421
to Doreen and her mom,

30:40.505 --> 30:43.675
and now that she thinks
about this next chapter in her life,

30:43.758 --> 30:45.927
it's so much more than just a business.

30:46.010 --> 30:49.305
It's about her family's legacy,
and she wants to honor that.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.807
It's really beautiful.

30:51.474 --> 30:54.811
Ah! They're so golden and beautiful!
I can't wait for you to see them!

30:54.894 --> 30:57.605
-You scared me!
-No, that's just me being excited.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.606
Voilà, mademoiselle.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.607
Pour vous.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.527
[Doreen] Wow. This is just so beautiful.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.529
What is on there? Just egg wash?

31:04.612 --> 31:06.739
And then I put a bit of demerara sugar,

31:06.823 --> 31:09.075
'cause I like that sugary crunch
when you bite into it

31:09.158 --> 31:12.787
because the pastry itself is just buttery.
It's kind of really neutral.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.747
So pretty. So pretty.

[Antoni] You like the pinwheel?

31:16.207 --> 31:18.334
-Yes.
-[Dorian] The pinwheel's very photogenic.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.587
-[Doreen] Gorgeous.
-I'm gonna send you this photo.

-[Doreen] Man, I'm telling you.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.720
-[Antoni] I wanna start with savory.
-[Doreen] Yeah.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.347
[Antoni] Holy crap.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.850
I would never have thought dill,
but that's brilliant.

31:33.933 --> 31:34.767
Oh man.

-[Dorian] Yeah.
-That dill.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.646

Cheers.

31:41.482 --> 31:42.317

31:44.694 --> 31:46.237
-That's it for me.
-Mm-hmm.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.323
-Mmm.
-[Dorian chuckles]

31:48.406 --> 31:50.283
-That's delicious.
-Consensus?

31:51.826 --> 31:54.287
-I love that.
-We can make big old braids.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.581
-And just cut, cut, cut.
-Yeah. 100%.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.000
So we have a savory,
and now what about sweet?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.543
Strawberry and blueberry.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.795
I feel like they're such crowd-pleasers.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.881
[Dorian] Berries and cream.
That's what it was.

32:10.511 --> 32:13.932
I love this, but I would switch it
for the cream cheese and powdered sugar

32:14.015 --> 32:15.475
because we're using fresh fruit,

32:15.558 --> 32:17.518

-Yeah, that's what I like.
-Yes.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.901
We're gonna do a classic pinwheel,

32:24.984 --> 32:28.613
cream cheese, confectioners' sugar,
touch of vanilla base,

32:28.696 --> 32:30.740
and then we're gonna
macerate some berries.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.492
-Yes.
-We got it.

was at the top of the mountain,

35:01.808 --> 35:04.393

35:06.437 --> 35:09.690
for as far as my eye I could see,
there were people.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.734
I couldn't speak any Spanish,

35:11.818 --> 35:14.904
and not too many of 'em,
you know, could speak English,

35:15.404 --> 35:19.951

and go get a snack, honey,

37:57.358 --> 37:59.777
'cause you don't wanna have
low blood sugar when you see this.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.072
Look at you.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.741
[Tan] Okay.
Now shall we talk about the clothes?

38:05.825 --> 38:06.659
Wow.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.910
Lots of colors.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.288
[Tan] Yeah.
We got you a bunch of dresses.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.207
I know you are not ordinarily the one
to wear dresses,

38:13.291 --> 38:15.668
but it's just a really easy way
to put on an outfit

38:15.751 --> 38:17.295
without having to really think about it.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.504
-Cool.
-[Tan] The look's done.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.381
Just need to find a shoe to match.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.383
-Wow.
-[Tan laughs]

38:22.466 --> 38:25.845
That's the word of this whole week,
is "wow." [chuckles]

38:25.928 --> 38:29.932
It's a whole different way
of looking at… me.

38:30.016 --> 38:33.561
Tonight I'm gonna belt it
to really highlight that shape.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.147
And I'm sure you noticed,
I gave you a flat.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.982
-Yes.
-[Tan] I want you to be comfortable.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.568
-[Doreen] A man who listens.
-[Tan laughs]

38:40.651 --> 38:42.320
-All right, ready for this?
-[guys] Yes.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.780
Doreen, beauty, will you please join me?

38:44.864 --> 38:46.115
Oh my God. I'm excited.

38:46.198 --> 38:47.533
She looks gorgeous!

38:47.616 --> 38:49.118
Wow!

38:49.201 --> 38:50.619
-[Antoni] Love!
-[Tan] I know!

38:50.703 --> 38:51.620
So gorgeous!

38:51.704 --> 38:54.373
-[Bobby] You look beautiful.
-[Jonathan] I love your little flats!

38:54.915 --> 38:59.712
I'm trying to say… I mean,
I had to figure out how to walk.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.255
[laughs]

39:01.339 --> 39:03.424
Oh my gosh, you're gorgeous!

39:03.507 --> 39:06.052
You look beautiful.

39:06.552 --> 39:09.347
[Doreen] It's really cool.
Like, the possibilities.

39:09.430 --> 39:12.516
It's like a parallel universe before. Wow.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.227
Here's the thing. I've got a feeling
somebody else might want a chat.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.563
I actually have
my own little surprise for you.

39:17.646 --> 39:20.441
You thought you were gonna go this week
without spending time with me

39:20.524 --> 39:21.942
and me spoiling you as well?

39:22.735 --> 39:27.281
We're gonna take a quick little car drive
and then maybe make a stop along the way.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.407
Okay, that'll work.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.701
-[Jonathan] Bye, honey.
-[Doreen] See y'all later.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.828
Because Doreen is performing
on the street,

39:32.912 --> 39:35.748
the struggle to get into
the cultural institutions has been hard.

39:35.831 --> 39:39.251
It doesn't take away from anything
of who she is as a musician,

39:39.335 --> 39:41.629
even though some doors
have been closed to her,

39:41.712 --> 39:45.383
'cause she's made a big impact
on the New Orleans jazz community.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.219
For you, the legacy
that you've created here

39:48.302 --> 39:51.055
is beyond yourself.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.891
It is something
that generations will admire.

39:53.974 --> 39:56.102
I know you told me,
like, the establishment,

39:56.185 --> 39:58.479
you know, the powers,
those places don't honor you.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.772
Mm-hmm.

39:59.855 --> 40:00.731
Yeah.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.442
Playing on the streets is a challenge,
you know?

40:03.526 --> 40:06.862
'Cause you're trying to get people
to notice you, to stop,

40:06.946 --> 40:09.907
you know, be entertained,
and give you money, you know?

40:09.990 --> 40:12.451
And I mean, the money comes now,

40:12.535 --> 40:14.620
but the whole time I was coming up,

40:14.703 --> 40:18.416
I was trying
to get appreciation and respect

40:18.499 --> 40:21.001
from authority figures or peers.

40:21.085 --> 40:21.919
Yeah.

40:22.002 --> 40:25.423
But now I'm thinking
it's just not gonna happen.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.925
I realize that, you know? Um…

40:28.008 --> 40:30.928
-But so many other people love me anyway.
-Yeah.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.013
It's been too long.

40:33.597 --> 40:38.853
What you do, as a Black woman,
is beyond powerful.

40:38.936 --> 40:39.895
[chuckles]

40:39.979 --> 40:44.275
You make every single one of us
feel alive.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.861
When I'm in the grocery store

40:47.361 --> 40:49.530
and somebody in front of me,

40:50.156 --> 40:53.033
they look back,
and they're like, "Oh my God! It's her!"

40:53.117 --> 40:54.660
and I'm like, "Who?"

40:54.743 --> 40:56.328
[laughing]

40:56.412 --> 40:57.830
I'm looking for her too, man.

40:57.913 --> 40:58.914
Like, golly.

40:58.998 --> 41:02.042
We get into that space,
and we don't even realize the magnitude

41:02.126 --> 41:05.337
and how big it is,
because it's just you being you.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.132
-And that impact because of that…
-Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

41:08.215 --> 41:11.594
…has gone far beyond
what you could have ever imagined.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.095
-Oh, thank you.
-[Karamo] Seriously.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.180
Yeah.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.307
So now, um, I'm stopping here.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.224
[Doreen] Okay.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.187
So I figured we'd take a little tour
around the Jazz Museum.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.314
Okay. Well, this is my thing.

41:23.397 --> 41:25.691
[Karamo] To see the legacy,
for me, as a young Black man,

41:25.774 --> 41:27.526
that they have inside of here.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.112
-There gon' be some Louis in here.
-Yeah.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.615
Ain't gon' be no Doreen,
but there gon' be some Louis.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.409
-[Karamo] Ain't gon' be no Doreen?
-[Doreen] Ain't gon' be no Doreen.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.619
[chuckles]

41:48.380 --> 41:49.215
Everyone…

41:50.799 --> 41:52.384
Doreen Ketchens!

41:52.468 --> 41:55.179
[cheering]

41:55.262 --> 41:56.764
[Dorian] Oh my gosh!

41:56.847 --> 41:58.849
[cheering]

42:00.017 --> 42:00.976
[Lawrence] I like that.

42:01.936 --> 42:02.770
Yes.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.688
-Look at her face. Like, "What?"
-Oh my God!

42:04.772 --> 42:07.358
-I sure like it. That's awesome.
-Oh, Mommy!

42:08.359 --> 42:10.027
You look beautiful.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.153
You sure do.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.614
-[Tan] Aw. "You sure do"!
-Oh my gosh!

42:15.032 --> 42:16.575
[Lawrence] Girl, we back in college.

42:16.659 --> 42:18.285
[laughing]

42:18.369 --> 42:19.203
[Antoni] Yes!

42:19.995 --> 42:21.121
[man] Hello, Doreen.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.415
We're excited to have you
at the New Orleans Jazz Museum.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.209
I'm a big fan personally,

42:25.292 --> 42:28.254
and, uh, I don't know if you recognize
some of the things here.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.713
[laughs]

42:29.797 --> 42:32.633
We would love to have a display here,
part of our exhibit,

42:32.716 --> 42:35.928
we would love to have you in it,
and we'd love to talk to you about it.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.265
Your own exhibit…

42:39.348 --> 42:40.224
I'm saying!

42:40.307 --> 42:41.517
…in the museum!

42:41.600 --> 42:43.227
[chuckles]

42:43.310 --> 42:46.021
If wanna actually bring up
the whole family. Can you all come up?

42:46.814 --> 42:49.817
[Karamo] She's been busking on the streets
of New Orleans for 40 years.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.404
She's finally getting affirmation that
her impact was made here in New Orleans

42:53.487 --> 42:55.739
and that her legacy will live on forever.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.074
-You ready?
-I think so.

42:57.157 --> 42:58.075
Okay.

42:58.867 --> 43:03.122
"Whereas jazz virtuoso, educator, and icon

43:03.706 --> 43:07.042
Dr. Doreen J. Ketchens, a clarinetist,

43:07.126 --> 43:09.587
has played
for four United States presidents,

43:09.670 --> 43:14.091
recorded an album
almost every year since 1994,

43:14.592 --> 43:19.096
and is widely considered
a cultural ambassador of New Orleans."

43:20.180 --> 43:23.851
"And whereas for decades,
the Clarinet Queen…"

43:23.934 --> 43:24.810
I love saying that!

43:24.893 --> 43:28.897
"…the Clarinet Queen has played
along Royal Street in the French Quarter

43:28.981 --> 43:33.235
with her band Doreen's Jazz New Orleans,
a group that has traveled the world

43:33.319 --> 43:37.031
performing their joyful, energetic,
and soulful New Orleans jazz

43:37.114 --> 43:39.450
in 47 States and 24 countries."

43:39.533 --> 43:41.994
"She has also performed
alongside musical greats

43:42.077 --> 43:44.622
such as Ellis Marsalis
and Trombone Shorty."

43:45.539 --> 43:48.542
"Doreen has performed
with the Louisiana Philharmonic

43:48.626 --> 43:50.961
at the St. Louis Cathedral,
at the Orpheum Theater,

43:51.045 --> 43:53.964
and during the New Orleans
tricentennial celebration."

43:54.048 --> 43:58.010
"And now, therefore, at the request
of City Council President Helena Moreno,

43:58.093 --> 44:00.054
be it proclaimed
by the City of New Orleans

44:00.137 --> 44:03.682
that the council honors
Dr. Doreen J. Ketchens,

44:03.766 --> 44:07.019
American jazz clarinetist
and cultural ambassador."

44:07.102 --> 44:09.438
"Thank you for sharing your talents
with the world

44:09.521 --> 44:12.483
on behalf of the beautiful city
of New Orleans."

44:12.566 --> 44:14.234
Signed by all seven members.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.569
[cheering]

44:16.945 --> 44:18.197
[Helena] We love you so much.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.407
Oh my gosh.
You're such an asset to the city.

44:20.491 --> 44:21.575
We adore you.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.077
That's for you.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.621
[Tan] Speech! Speech! Speech!

44:26.246 --> 44:28.957
Well, I tell you one thing.

44:29.541 --> 44:35.172
When I walked in,
I said, "Louis Armstrong is my influence."

44:35.255 --> 44:37.091
"You'll find a lot of him in here,

44:37.591 --> 44:39.677
but you ain't gon' find
no Doreen up in here."

44:40.803 --> 44:42.429
Well, I was wrong.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.515
[laughing]

44:45.432 --> 44:47.601
Thank you so much,

44:47.685 --> 44:52.356
Miss Sadie, Miss Moreno, the Fab Five,

44:52.439 --> 44:56.735
and just so many
of you wonderful, beautiful, absolute…

44:56.819 --> 44:57.736
I'm just…

44:57.820 --> 45:01.657
As I look through the room,
I'm like, "Calm down. Calm down."

45:01.740 --> 45:02.783
"How'd you get here?"

45:02.866 --> 45:04.535
I mean, goodness gracious!

45:04.618 --> 45:06.495
[laughing]

45:07.079 --> 45:09.415
Thank y'all. I mean, just… Wow.

45:09.498 --> 45:10.874
I mean, wow.

45:10.958 --> 45:13.711
It's so many levels. So many levels.

45:13.794 --> 45:16.463
It's just amazing,
and I really appreciate it.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.464
Thank you.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.092
[upbeat music playing]

45:20.175 --> 45:21.009
Thank you.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.263
[squeals]

45:26.765 --> 45:31.019
So often, we celebrate people when
they're not here to enjoy the celebration.

45:31.103 --> 45:34.273
So for her to be able
to see the admiration

45:34.356 --> 45:35.357
is so special.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.234
Look at you. So glammed out.

45:37.317 --> 45:38.986
I know, huh? What in the world?

45:39.069 --> 45:42.406
Every single time I ever walked
or biked past you in the Quarter,

45:42.489 --> 45:45.284
it's always my stop,
and it always gives me a ton of joy.

45:45.367 --> 45:46.243
Thank you.

45:46.326 --> 45:49.788
It's now time to go see
another New Orleans icon,

45:49.872 --> 45:51.248
which is Doreen's Sweet Shop.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.668
Is everybody ready
to go see Doreen's Sweet Shop?

45:54.752 --> 45:56.879
-See Miss Anna May's legacy?
-Yes. Yes.

45:56.962 --> 45:58.797
Yes? All right. Let's get out of here!

45:58.881 --> 46:00.382
[man] All right! Let's go!

46:00.466 --> 46:02.050
Whoo!

46:03.886 --> 46:05.721
["When the Saints Go Marching In" playing]

46:10.726 --> 46:11.894
Oh my!

46:14.438 --> 46:15.314
Wow.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.618
Oh my goodness gracious.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.287
[uplifting music playing]

46:33.791 --> 46:35.667
Looks like somebody else's joint.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.252
No. This is yours.

46:42.674 --> 46:43.717
Goodness gracious.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.928
[Dorian] All you gotta do
is open them doors, girl.

46:46.512 --> 46:47.846
You ready to go inside?

46:47.930 --> 46:48.889
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

46:48.972 --> 46:51.183
[Doreen] It smells like
my mother's in there.

46:51.266 --> 46:52.267
-[cheering]
-[Bobby] Okay.

46:52.351 --> 46:53.393
Open your eyes.

46:56.522 --> 46:59.107
[laughing] Oh! Oh my gosh!

46:59.608 --> 47:00.818
[Dorian] Your name's on every…

47:00.901 --> 47:01.777
[gasps]

47:01.860 --> 47:03.570
[Doreen laughing]

47:03.654 --> 47:05.239
Oh my goodness gracious.

47:06.907 --> 47:07.950
[chuckles]

47:08.033 --> 47:10.536
Oh my goodness.

47:10.619 --> 47:12.663
Oh my goodness gracious!

47:12.746 --> 47:14.957
[laughs]

47:15.749 --> 47:18.335
Oh my goodness gracious.

47:21.129 --> 47:23.131
[laughing]

47:24.341 --> 47:25.634
Oh my.

47:25.717 --> 47:27.219
Just so full.

47:27.302 --> 47:29.137
Just so grateful.

47:29.221 --> 47:30.180
Just so blessed.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.932
Just so thankful.

47:32.015 --> 47:33.642
Goodness freaking gracious!

47:33.725 --> 47:36.144
-Oh my God, she almost cussed!
-[laughing]

47:36.228 --> 47:37.813
-Oh my God!
-[laughs]

47:37.896 --> 47:40.190
[Doreen] First thing I saw was my mom,

47:40.274 --> 47:43.277
then I see my dad,
and then I see my beautiful daughter.

47:43.360 --> 47:49.324
Amazing to me
how they're just set in… stone.

47:50.409 --> 47:52.911
[Bobby]
Your family has such a rich legacy here.

47:52.995 --> 47:56.248
Music, culture, and this sweet shop.

47:56.331 --> 47:58.625
Oh my goodness.
Thank you guys so very much.

47:59.334 --> 48:00.752
Oh my goodness gracious.

48:00.836 --> 48:02.880
-And our masterpieces.
-[Dorian] Pastry!

48:02.963 --> 48:05.048
[Bobby]
I feel like we're on the right track.

48:05.132 --> 48:09.094
It was really important to me for her
to just kind of remember what it was,

48:09.177 --> 48:11.388
and that way, as they finish,

48:11.471 --> 48:14.600
she can really prepare herself
for what it's about to be.

48:14.683 --> 48:16.727
Can I be the first kid
that steals from the store?

48:16.810 --> 48:17.978
[Karamo] He's the first kid!

48:18.061 --> 48:19.771
[Doreen] Oh man. We gonna let 'em in?

48:19.855 --> 48:21.857
-I'm ready.
-And look how hot you look!

48:21.940 --> 48:23.275
[Doreen] We gotta do that walk.

48:23.358 --> 48:25.360
-Yeah!
-Yes!

48:25.444 --> 48:27.112
[crowd cheering]

48:32.034 --> 48:33.201
[Doreen] Come on in.

48:33.285 --> 48:39.124
Today, Doreen realizes that she is
an important part of this community.

48:39.207 --> 48:42.085
-This is beautiful.
-Isn't it beautiful?

48:42.169 --> 48:44.379
She has carved out a space

48:44.463 --> 48:47.674
that is so unique
for the artist that she is.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.636
And to have that immortalized
in an institution

48:50.719 --> 48:53.680
so that when people come,
they get to learn about your life

48:53.764 --> 48:58.310
and what you've contributed to your city
and to the jazz music scene,

48:58.393 --> 48:59.811
it's decades in the making.

48:59.895 --> 49:02.689
[Jonathan] Can never get enough candy.
It's free, okay?

49:02.773 --> 49:03.857
Do you guys want some candy?

49:03.941 --> 49:05.609
The sweet shop will also hopefully be

49:05.692 --> 49:09.780
an avenue of passion, legacy,
and connection and community

49:09.863 --> 49:12.741
that Doreen can pursue
for as long as she wants to.

49:12.824 --> 49:15.202
Wow. So awesome.

49:15.285 --> 49:18.789
Oh man. This is absolutely stunning.

49:18.872 --> 49:21.375
[Antoni] Making these
and experimenting with you and Dorian

49:21.458 --> 49:25.337
has been one of the most joyous things
I've experienced in a really long time.

49:25.420 --> 49:27.714
-Same.
-Like, it was just so fun to play.

49:28.882 --> 49:34.179
I'm at the stage now
where I got this huge head start,

49:34.262 --> 49:36.723
and I got these great ideas

49:36.807 --> 49:41.895
for something my mother and father
would definitely be proud of,

49:41.979 --> 49:44.022
and young Doreen, you know?

49:44.106 --> 49:49.861
And I really feel as though I was able
to realize a very important journey today,

49:49.945 --> 49:54.616
having the music and the sweet shop,
the legacy, you know, hand in hand.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.952
It's like a fairy tale, man.
It's just wonderful.

49:57.536 --> 50:03.542
And I'll make sure, when you walk in here,
you smell and you hear love.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.627
["When the Saints Go Marching In" playing]

50:59.181 --> 51:00.432
[woman] Whoo-hoo!

51:46.144 --> 51:49.064
[cheering and applause]
