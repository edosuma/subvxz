01:51.778 --> 01:53.488
[Butt Hunter]
Sorry, little guy.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.448
New rules
coming from the Bureau.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.660
They want me
to shoot to kill.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.036
[gun fires]

02:04.958 --> 02:05.959
Last one.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.712
I always get my Butt.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.715
[Teddy] Indeed you do.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.639
I could use
a man of your skills.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.724
What the fuck is this?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.726
You're supposed
to be extinct.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.521
[Teddy] You have no idea
what we're capable of.

02:26.604 --> 02:30.859
Scrubbing our names
from the Bureau's roster was nothing.

02:31.901 --> 02:32.986
"Our names"?

02:34.362 --> 02:35.738
[Butts snarling nearby]

02:56.593 --> 03:00.930
[Teddy] Now then,
I need you to find someone.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.352
Okay.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.371
Vic?

03:26.789 --> 03:27.749
It's 3:00 a.m.

03:29.000 --> 03:29.918
You okay?

03:32.086 --> 03:34.464
Why did you
want to meet here?

03:34.547 --> 03:37.675
This wouldn't have
anything to do with me singing and dancing

03:37.759 --> 03:39.260
in an Immortimas onesie,
would it?

03:40.970 --> 03:42.680
You remember
my friend Deric?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.474
Robotics club, right?

03:44.557 --> 03:47.101
- Yeah.
- You used to be attached at the hip.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.603
I went to see him
not too long ago.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.397
Fell back
into our old ways.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.484
I'm glad to hear that.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.152
You said you wanted
to find your bliss.

03:56.235 --> 03:57.820
[Vic] I did what
I thought I wanted,

03:59.155 --> 04:01.032
but it led me
right back here.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.703
Deric thinks
I should be Cyborg again.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.420
Do you want me
to be Cyborg?

04:14.504 --> 04:18.216
I made that decision
for you once before, and look where it got us.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.681
But I have to admit,
I was a little relieved

04:24.764 --> 04:26.432
when you let
that part of your life go.

04:26.516 --> 04:30.103
I thought my boy wouldn't be
risking his life every day.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.147
And yet...

04:34.607 --> 04:35.858
And yet?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.860
Well, come on, man,
you didn't get a job,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.990
pick up a new hobby,
start a business.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.034
You didn't even come home.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.328
You kept doing the hero thing
and risking your life anyway.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.039
Just without the tech.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.332
Why?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.629
[sighs]

04:59.590 --> 05:01.092
I don't know.

05:01.175 --> 05:05.680
Victor, a man always knows
why he moves the way he does.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.017
You can lie to me
all you want.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.228
You start lying to yourself,
that's when you're in trouble.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.691
I wanted to help people.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.989
I think I still do.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.128
Can I show you something?

05:38.254 --> 05:39.881
[Silas] Hmm.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.424
- [knocking on door]
- All right. Jeez Louise.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.760
Keep your hair on.
God damn it.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.261
Give me a goddamn--

05:45.344 --> 05:46.888
- Hi.
- Fuck! Jesus Christ!

05:48.181 --> 05:50.141
- [grunts]
- Ow!

05:51.559 --> 05:52.435
Fucking--

05:52.518 --> 05:53.895
[Madame Rouge grunts]

05:55.646 --> 05:57.356
Right.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.776
Okay, I knew it wasn't
going to be so easy for you to back off.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.111
So if it is
revenge that you want,

06:02.195 --> 06:05.364
you are going to have
to go through all of them.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.824
Please don't kill me.
I don't want to die.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.950
Please.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.578
[laughing]

06:12.622 --> 06:13.790
Ah.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.876
You are too funny.
Love that about you.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.878
No, I'm not here
to kill you guys.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.797
I am here to invite you

06:20.880 --> 06:24.258
to my new
one-woman theatrical event.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.177
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come again. What?

06:26.260 --> 06:28.471
I've done a lot
of soul searching in the past eight hours,

06:28.554 --> 06:33.518
after you and your friends
completely destroyed my holiday utopia.

06:33.601 --> 06:37.563
And I realized
it wasn't super cool

06:37.647 --> 06:40.191
to force all of humanity
to love me.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.401
I'm not Disney. [chuckles]

06:42.485 --> 06:43.945
No.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.739
If I want people's respect,
then I need to do the work.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.576
So, drum roll, please.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.870
Ta-da!

06:52.954 --> 06:54.372
I'm workshopping it
this afternoon

06:54.455 --> 06:55.665
at the Cloverton Playhouse.

06:55.748 --> 07:00.211
And then we, me...
I open tonight.

07:00.294 --> 07:03.172
- Wow. That's some--
- Fast, I know.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.882
But I'm being realistic.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.175
Probably won't make it
to Broadway

07:06.259 --> 07:09.679
till, like, next week, so...

07:09.762 --> 07:13.641
It'd mean the world to me
if you and your weird friends could come.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.352
You all really
keep me grounded.

07:16.435 --> 07:20.356
Well then,
I will check with them.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.233
Great! I'll see you tonight.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.237
Cloverton Playhouse.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.158
Yes. The fuck?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.161
[Larry grunting]

07:43.629 --> 07:45.131
[Larry] Oh, God damn it.

07:53.973 --> 07:54.932
You all right?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.894
[Larry] I'm fine.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.230
Why are you digging
a giant hole in the ground?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.315
[Larry] It's not a hole.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.277
Ooh. Dark.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.946
Isn't it a tad premature
to be getting your affairs in order?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.990
- [groans]
- Let me help you.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.533
No. I said I'm fine.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.868
You're not fine.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.328
Okay, you got me.

08:15.411 --> 08:18.164
My skin is thinning
and my body's breaking down.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.373
You happy?

08:19.457 --> 08:20.917
Can't all go
on vacation like you.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.877
It's not a vacation.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.548
I need to see
where I'm from.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.593
Where I'm supposed
to be from before I...

08:30.676 --> 08:32.970
Before you what?

08:33.054 --> 08:35.806
The elements in my body,
they're unstable.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.434
More so by the day.

08:38.517 --> 08:43.773
Once I see Tamil Nadu...
I'm going to rent a boat,

08:43.856 --> 08:46.525
sail deep out
into the Bay of Bengal...

08:48.069 --> 08:50.029
and go for one last swim.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.574
Then, while I still have
control over my abilities,

08:54.909 --> 08:57.036
turn myself
into a block of lead.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.373
And that will be that.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.167
And you call me dark?

09:03.251 --> 09:06.003
Well, at least it's more poetic
than digging your own grave

09:06.087 --> 09:08.005
in front of some
rotting greenhouse.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.967
You could come with me.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.886
I can't. I have to
do this for Keeg.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.972
I know he can survive
inside these orchids.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.808
At least this way,
we'll be together.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.435
Doesn't really
seem fair to Keeg.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.479
Are you
fucking kidding me?

09:23.562 --> 09:25.314
The whole reason
he and I are in this mess

09:25.398 --> 09:28.359
is because
I gave up my longevity, chasing your stupid dream.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.610
I know.

09:31.904 --> 09:36.617
And I am so sorry
to both of you.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.036
I know we said
we'd try to find another way, but...

09:40.788 --> 09:42.498
I don't know
what else to do.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.084
Do you?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.384
[Larry sighs]

09:53.467 --> 09:56.512
[Larry] You know,
for a second there,

09:56.596 --> 09:59.056
I really thought we might
find our way through this.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.436
Fuck you
for giving me hope.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.498
[sighs]

10:29.253 --> 10:32.465
[exhales deeply]
Much better.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.342
All right, Bendy.
If anybody's going to

10:34.425 --> 10:35.801
care about the shit,
it's you.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.012
Excuse me,
but would you kindly get off?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.017
What are you doing?

10:43.100 --> 10:45.811
I'm just taking a breather.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.565
Releasing my form
helps with my arthritis.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.942
No joints, no joint pain.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.612
- Uh-huh.
- That being said,

10:54.695 --> 10:57.198
there is still
work to be done.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.079
[groans]

11:03.162 --> 11:04.413
Indeed there is.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.665
We have just had a visit

11:06.749 --> 11:10.252
by none other
than Isabel Feathers.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.338
Oh. How is she?

11:12.421 --> 11:13.714
[Madame Rouge]
How is she?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.925
This isn't some
bloody old schoolmate

11:16.008 --> 11:17.718
that you just ran into
at the market.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.930
This is Immortus.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.265
She's a supervillain.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.642
Is she, though?

11:24.725 --> 11:26.852
I have to admit,
Immortimas may have been

11:26.936 --> 11:30.564
a somewhat
ham-fisted attempt at glory,

11:30.648 --> 11:33.025
but it wasn't all that bad.

11:33.109 --> 11:37.530
Honestly,
I found a lot of joy

11:37.613 --> 11:40.616
in my role as leader
of the household. [chuckles]

11:40.699 --> 11:42.618
Oh, that's why
it looks like Julia Child

11:42.701 --> 11:45.287
went on a cocaine binge then,
is it?

[Rita grunting]

11:47.873 --> 11:49.500
- Can I help--
- I can do it myself.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.669
Thank you very much.

11:51.752 --> 11:55.464
We never did get to sit down
to that family dinner,

11:55.548 --> 11:58.509
so I figured
what better time than now.

11:58.592 --> 12:01.095
I think there are
some more pressing matters to worry about

12:01.178 --> 12:03.806
- than a chicken parmigiana.
- Nonsense.

12:03.889 --> 12:08.144
Best we spend what little time
we have left together.

12:08.227 --> 12:12.106
In moments of crisis,
families are supposed to come together

12:12.189 --> 12:14.066
and rally around each other.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.902
What more can we do? Hmm?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.407
- Let me get back
to you on that. - Hmm.

I finally got
my stud-wagon together,

I want to drive to Florida to see your daughter?

- Fuck off.
- Okay.

from the Ant Farm.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.041
- [Larry and Rita] Ew.
- [Cliff laughing]

15:59.124 --> 16:01.960
What in God's name is that?

16:02.044 --> 16:05.547
This photo is Isabel's
<i>World of Wut</i> appearance

16:05.631 --> 16:08.342
a couple of days back,
and I... I noticed this

16:08.425 --> 16:09.718
on her lower neck.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.845
[Larry] She should really
get that checked out.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.222
Wait for it.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.057
[Rita, Larry
and Cliff groaning]

16:15.140 --> 16:18.227
- [Cliff] Is that
a fossilized little turd? - [Madame Rouge] No.

16:18.310 --> 16:23.440
This was a necklace worn
by one Dr. Niles Caulder.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.777
Chief wore a little turd
around his neck?

16:26.860 --> 16:29.071
The clothes maketh the man.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.740
Take a closer look,

16:31.824 --> 16:36.370
and see if there's
any similarities there.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.289
- Anything at all.
- [Cliff] Um...

16:39.373 --> 16:42.876
[sighs] When Isabel fell into
that time stream--

16:42.960 --> 16:46.046
- Because of you.
- Yes, Cliff.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.924
When she fell in,

16:49.007 --> 16:52.428
she was trapped there
for a millennia.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.471
It did something to her.

16:54.555 --> 16:58.851
The more time passed,
the more her power grew,

16:58.934 --> 17:02.938
and it seemed
to manifest on her body.

17:03.021 --> 17:07.526
This... This is what
makes her Immortus.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.571
This is the source
of her power.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.157
- [Larry] But how did it--
- [Madame Rouge] Come off her body?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.617
I don't know,
and I don't care to.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.662
But when it did,
it fell through time.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.497
And according to
Wally's research,

17:20.581 --> 17:22.833
it landed in the past,

17:22.916 --> 17:24.793
which eventually found its way
into the hands

17:24.877 --> 17:26.462
of your fearless leader.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.965
This... This is the key
to your longevity.

17:30.048 --> 17:33.135
This is what
was inside all of you.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.636
[Rita, Larry and Cliff] Ew!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.889
Well, that was until
Wally's freaks stole it back

17:36.972 --> 17:40.809
and used it to raise her
from the time stream.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.979
So the key to Isabel's power
is a fucking skin tag?

17:44.062 --> 17:46.482
Well, you could
call it that. Yes.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.484
But now it's back on her,
and I have a hunch

17:48.567 --> 17:50.235
that if we were
just to chop it off--

17:50.319 --> 17:52.654
- [Rita and Cliff] Ew.
- No. And then we have a chance

17:52.738 --> 17:56.909
of stopping you all
aging any further.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.036
This is our shot.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.162
Look. This.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.417
We should go to the show.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.339
[Cliff] Nope. Nope,
not gonna happen.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.257
We're all
about to drop dead,

18:12.341 --> 18:14.384
and you want us
to go up against some all-powerful theater major

18:14.468 --> 18:15.677
who can control time?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.596
Well, yes,
there is some risk involved.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.223
[Cliff] "Some risk"?

18:19.306 --> 18:22.059
This chick
could blink us into a reality

18:22.142 --> 18:24.561
where we're tortured
around the clock

18:24.645 --> 18:27.397
by flesh eating
Beanie Babies.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.943
No! Uh-uh. No.
I'm not going down like that.

18:31.026 --> 18:34.822
I wanna die in peace
with my daughter and my grandson,

18:34.905 --> 18:36.448
and that's what
I'm going to do.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.034
I... I really
don't understand.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.369
I mean, I thought
that you wanted--

18:40.452 --> 18:43.914
I just told you
what I want, okay?

18:43.997 --> 18:47.876
I'm not going to spend
what little time I have left

18:47.960 --> 18:52.339
chasing after some
magical fucking mole.

18:52.422 --> 18:57.344
So just do what you do best
and worry about yourself.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.096
[scoffs]

18:59.179 --> 19:01.682
Jane, let's ride.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.434
- Will you be
back in time for dinner? - [Cliff] Nope.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.230
Larry, surely you--

19:08.313 --> 19:10.899
Why do you even care about
what happens to any of us?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.651
Aren't you the one
that abandoned us

19:12.734 --> 19:15.112
and left us for dead
in the future?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.574
Okay. That, um...

19:18.657 --> 19:21.034
That was just
one possible future.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.248
I won't abandon all of you.
I want to help.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.624
[Larry] I can't risk dying

19:27.708 --> 19:29.376
until I find
a better solution for Keeg,

19:29.459 --> 19:30.878
so count me out.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.135
I don't believe it.

19:38.218 --> 19:43.140
A good team leader knows
when there's no mission to lead.

19:43.223 --> 19:49.813
We've all suffered
more indignity and hardships than any one person deserves.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.858
And as much
as I hate to say it, so has Isabel.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.779
Our long lives
came at her expense.

19:57.863 --> 20:02.451
Let's leave the poor girl be
and go out with a bit of class.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.536
All right?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.754
[Vic] It's basically
all the same core technology,

20:13.837 --> 20:16.131
but Deric and I made
a few modifications.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.015
Are you sure
this is what you really want?

20:29.102 --> 20:30.646
I'm not going
to pressure you.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.647
It's not that.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.149
If I'm going to do this,

20:34.232 --> 20:37.444
I just need to know
it's not going to be like it was before.

20:37.527 --> 20:41.448
Well, I'm confident
I can execute these upgrades.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.658
Shouldn't be too difficult.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.201
I'm not talking
about the tech.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.662
[sighs]

20:48.038 --> 20:49.289
Last time...

20:51.124 --> 20:52.668
I lost myself.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.795
Mom was gone.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.630
I cut off
Deric and the guys.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.300
And you and me,
we couldn't even

21:00.384 --> 21:01.718
catch a breath
to stop fighting.

21:03.553 --> 21:06.056
[scoffs] Cyborg...

21:07.975 --> 21:10.018
he was a shell of a man.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.146
And for the record,

21:13.230 --> 21:17.025
we started fighting
when I could not pull you away from that Xbox.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.444
Not for sleep,
church, school.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.904
How dare you?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.656
It was a PlayStation.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.992
[both chuckle softly]

21:25.075 --> 21:30.914
When you became Cyborg,
you were grieving.

21:30.998 --> 21:34.251
You were only that shell
because your mother had just died.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.298
I should have
been a better father when that happened.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.262
- All I can say is--
- You were grieving, too.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.056
I know.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.475
I lost
part of myself that day.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.604
And I thought that

21:56.148 --> 21:58.775
getting rid of my tech
might make me feel whole again.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.320
Did it?

22:03.405 --> 22:04.906
No.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.954
I don't know
if I ever will.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.754
I just miss the man
I used to be.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.263
You can't hide it, son.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.891
You're a hero.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.811
Just be one
on your own terms.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.125
[Jane] Why are you driving
like a fucking old person?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.961
I'm trying to get
to Clara and Rory in one piece.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.757
- And make it in time
for Rory's wedding? - Fuck off.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.759
Seriously, what gives?

23:05.842 --> 23:07.636
[rock music playing on stereo]

23:07.719 --> 23:10.222
[Cliff] You can only
get fucked by reality so many times

23:10.305 --> 23:12.849
before you have to throw
your hands up and face it.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.728
I'm dying.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.814
That's all there is to it.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.316
So this is...
This is me saying goodbye.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.655
And I'm fucking pissed,
you know?

23:26.738 --> 23:29.491
We always think
that we have time, but I missed out on Clara.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.993
And I won
the fucking lotto with Rory, and I got a second chance.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.204
And now
I'm going to miss out on that kid's life, too.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.997
It's not fucking fair.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.878
Well, if we're
running out of time,

23:41.962 --> 23:47.050
- [in New Jersey accent]
fucking drive faster, huh? - [laughing] Okay.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.009
[engine revving]

23:52.264 --> 23:54.307
[regular voice]
Maybe not that fast.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.688
Uh... Shit...

23:59.771 --> 24:01.815
Oh, shit.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.567
- Cliff.
- Uh, a little help here.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.152
I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.736
- No, seriously, I'm stuck.
No, I'm stuck. - Shit.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.030
- Fuck. Shit, shit.
- Okay, slow the fuck down.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.323
[Cliff] Oh, shit.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.826
[tires screeching]

24:12.909 --> 24:15.537
[Jane gasping]

24:18.039 --> 24:18.999
I'm driving.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.420
[Cliff] Or it's time
to grab the shotgun

24:23.503 --> 24:24.796
and take me
behind the woodshed.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.632
That's not funny.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.426
Joking. I'm just...
I'm just joking.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.262
[Jane sighs]

24:35.932 --> 24:40.353
This is a story
about a girl named Izzy.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.816
[jazz bass playing]

24:48.403 --> 24:53.533
Desperate for air,
I finally sprung forth from my mother's birth canal.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.706
[mimics baby crying]

24:59.789 --> 25:04.002
But, Mama,
I'm gonna be a star.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.964
Get your head
out of the clouds, Isabel.

25:08.048 --> 25:12.427
Nobody's ever gotten
out of Cloverton, and nobody ever will.

25:12.510 --> 25:16.723
I reached out to the mysterious
Scottish woman for help.

25:16.806 --> 25:21.228
But she just sniffed
her piss-stained fingers and did nothing.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.812
And so I plunged.

25:24.189 --> 25:28.652
Down, down,
down into eternity.

25:28.735 --> 25:31.112
[mimics baby crying]

25:34.658 --> 25:35.784
[gulps]

25:35.867 --> 25:37.452
[burps]

25:37.535 --> 25:38.620
Happy birthday.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.794
All I ever wanted
was for people to see me.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.630
Really see me.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.132
Even if they don't like
what they see,

25:51.216 --> 25:53.218
maybe, just maybe,

25:54.552 --> 25:56.846
they'd find a way
to accept me anyway.

25:58.223 --> 26:02.018
Because if they really saw me,
they would see

26:02.102 --> 26:07.732
I am a powerhouse virtuoso,
a future double EGOT winner.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.069
My generation's
Ashley Tisdale.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.947
And I would be loved.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.659
Just like I deserve to be.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.791
[switch clangs]

26:25.917 --> 26:26.835
[giggles]

26:26.918 --> 26:28.295
[clapping]

26:29.254 --> 26:31.589
Ah!

26:33.341 --> 26:34.509
Well?

26:35.135 --> 26:36.553
I didn't get it.

26:37.721 --> 26:41.266
Oh. Okay.
What didn't you get?

26:41.349 --> 26:45.270
I mean, why are we supposed
to care about this character?

26:45.353 --> 26:46.563
She's not very likable.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.315
Yeah.
And why this story now?

26:48.398 --> 26:50.734
And why does the time machine
drill through the earth?

26:53.153 --> 26:56.281
But you think it's ready
to open tonight, right?

26:57.949 --> 26:59.993
[audience laughing]

27:06.750 --> 27:07.959
Stop laughing.

27:10.962 --> 27:11.796
I said...

27:11.880 --> 27:13.423
[in demonic voice] Stop!

27:18.136 --> 27:19.554
[grunts in frustration]

27:19.637 --> 27:22.807
Why won't people
just accept me?

27:23.516 --> 27:24.934
[sighs]

27:25.018 --> 27:30.607
You know, I ask myself
that same thing all the time.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.525
[Immortus in normal voice] You.

27:32.609 --> 27:37.072
If it weren't for you,
none of this would have happened to me.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.948
[in demonic voice]
This is all your fault.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.660
For what it's worth,
I actually really loved your performance.

27:43.787 --> 27:44.913
It was...

27:55.090 --> 27:56.466
[door closes]

27:56.549 --> 27:59.302
[Nicholas] Hey, sweetie.
How was your day?

28:00.261 --> 28:01.304
Um...

28:03.014 --> 28:05.266
Can you come
out here, Nicholas?

28:06.351 --> 28:09.270
I, um...
I have a message for you.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.606
It's... It's from Teddy.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.153
[Nicholas] Teddy's alive?

28:17.237 --> 28:19.114
Just let me
get through this.

28:23.159 --> 28:27.705
"Nicholas, the time has come
to lead a revolution.

28:27.789 --> 28:32.961
"I will no longer stand by
and watch humanity reduce us to nothing.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.587
"They've cut us off
at our knees

28:34.671 --> 28:37.090
"before we could even climb.

28:37.173 --> 28:41.511
"Used us as weapons,
turned us into monsters.

28:41.594 --> 28:45.098
"But together,
we can rebuild our former glory

28:45.181 --> 28:46.641
"and save our kind

28:46.724 --> 28:49.561
"from the desolate future
they have planned for us.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.355
"Join me in our crusade."

28:52.439 --> 28:55.275
He's crazy.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.610
- There's more.
- [Nicholas] I don't care.

28:57.694 --> 29:01.322
He wants a life of vengeance,
but I want a life with you.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.740
I'll never join him.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.412
Please let me finish.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.208
"You're probably saying
you'll never join me.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.587
But I've made it
easier for you.

You won't have to choose.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.019

30:02.842 --> 30:03.885
What's going on
with you?

30:04.928 --> 30:05.845
I'm fine.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.764
Bullshit.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.396
Do you know
what dementia is?

30:15.480 --> 30:18.107
- Kinda.
- I think I have that.

30:19.817 --> 30:21.903
I've been hearing voices.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.405
- Um...
- No, it's...

30:24.489 --> 30:26.324
This is not like
the personas.

30:26.407 --> 30:30.245
This is...
I don't know.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.746
What are they saying?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.249
"Say it."

30:34.332 --> 30:36.125
Say what?

30:36.209 --> 30:39.379
That's just it.
I don't know what "it" is.

30:40.129 --> 30:41.923
Do the others?

30:42.006 --> 30:43.883
I'm kind of on my own.

30:43.967 --> 30:44.968
Well, no,
you're not on your own.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.844
You always have us.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.221
You're dying.

30:50.848 --> 30:52.475
Right.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.894
I have no idea
what the hell is going on in the Underground.

30:54.978 --> 30:55.937
I never do.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.315
I know it's on me
to figure it out,

30:59.399 --> 31:02.860
but I am so fucking tired
of figuring it out.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.534
[Daddy] Say it.

31:10.868 --> 31:13.246
[Cliff] Who, whoa, whoa, Jane!

31:14.706 --> 31:16.040
[Cliff grunts]

31:20.044 --> 31:21.796
[Cliff] Let's just go home.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.595
Yeah, you're trying,
you're trying, you're trying

31:28.678 --> 31:31.764
to get people to accept you,
but they just won't do it.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.891
Totally. Even when
I'm doing my best.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.185
I bust my boobs
to win those people,

31:36.269 --> 31:38.021
and they haven't
really embraced me.

31:38.104 --> 31:41.649
Still not part of their
fucked up little family.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.859
Right?

31:42.942 --> 31:44.652
So back to me,
I was just saying--

31:44.736 --> 31:47.071
- Maybe it's impossible...
- [sighs]

31:47.155 --> 31:49.324
...to actually ever win
anyone over.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.492
You know,
if people don't like you, they don't like you.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.910
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

31:53.911 --> 31:55.788
- That's not true.
- It's true.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.875
Is it?

31:58.958 --> 32:01.669
Sometimes
I actually really miss the Brotherhood of Evil.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.047
At least they accepted me
for who I was.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.425
Brotherhood of Evil?

32:07.508 --> 32:08.676
Yeah.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.304
We were a vicious,
vicious little gang

32:11.387 --> 32:15.058
of masterminds hell bent
on world domination.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.393
It was fun. It was fun.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.812
- But it didn't
really work out. - Huh.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.108
But what if it could?

32:24.192 --> 32:26.194
Maybe the mistake I made
with Immortimas

32:26.277 --> 32:28.488
wasn't forcing people
to love me,

32:28.571 --> 32:32.158
it was forcing people
to love me.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.702
Maybe people
should fear me instead.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.245
That'll make them
love me, right?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.539
Mmm...

32:38.623 --> 32:41.709
Maybe world domination
is just the simplest, cleanest path for me.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.420
Maybe I should become
a supervillain.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.755
I wasn't
really suggesting--

32:45.838 --> 32:47.465
I love this!

32:47.548 --> 32:50.468
Oh, my God.
This makes so much sense.

32:50.551 --> 32:51.678
I love this for us.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.054
- Us?
- Yeah.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.431
Every supervillain needs, like,
a helper, right?

32:55.515 --> 32:58.726
Like Renfield to Dracula,

32:58.810 --> 33:01.521
or Hoda
to Kathie Lee Gifford.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.690
You could be my Hoda.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.191
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.610
I'm past all of that.
I... I...

33:08.820 --> 33:11.280
- I couldn't.
- Come on.

33:12.448 --> 33:15.910
With your experience
and my power,

33:15.993 --> 33:18.246
we can make
the whole world love us

33:19.414 --> 33:22.208
through fear.
[chuckles]

33:32.301 --> 33:35.179

33:36.139 --> 33:37.348
Oh, thank heavens.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.600
I knew you wouldn't
let me dine alone.

33:41.018 --> 33:43.396
[Larry] You know
I don't eat, right?

33:43.479 --> 33:45.857
Larry, just enjoy
the aroma.

33:47.483 --> 33:50.278
How was your day?
What have you been up to?

33:50.361 --> 33:53.573
[Larry sighs] I just spent
the last three hours in Niles's office

33:53.656 --> 33:56.534
studying star charts
from the day of my accident.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.286
[Rita] Hmm.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.913
I was hoping
I might be able to find wherever Keeg is from.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.790
I knew it was a long shot,

34:02.874 --> 34:05.752
but I hoped I might find
a better place for him than a dirty greenhouse.

34:07.044 --> 34:09.589
What do you think about this
as an epitaph?

34:09.672 --> 34:13.593
"Here lies Larry Trainor.
He failed at everything."

34:13.676 --> 34:16.596
Oh, don't be so maudlin.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.556
[clears throat]
Let's just sit here

34:19.557 --> 34:21.184
and enjoy our meal.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.977
What's going on with you?

34:23.060 --> 34:25.271
Why are you acting
like everything's okay?

34:25.354 --> 34:28.232
- I'm not. I just--
- We're dying, Rita.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.777
At this point,
the least we can do is be honest about it.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.279
You know what?
I've worked my fingers to the bone

34:33.362 --> 34:34.781
to prepare this lovely meal,

34:34.864 --> 34:38.409
so the least
that you can do is to enjoy.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.411
I don't eat!

34:40.495 --> 34:42.413
Jesus Christ.
Rita, you're not listening to me.

34:42.497 --> 34:46.250
No, you are not
listening to me.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.795
All you want to do
is talk about death.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.881
All I want to do
is not talk about it.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.216
Why is that so hard?

34:53.299 --> 34:56.719
Why is it so hard for you
to be here for me?

34:56.803 --> 34:58.638
I am literally
sitting right here.

34:58.721 --> 35:01.182
Ever since
you voted against me for team leader.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.602
Oh, my God.
You're still upset about that?

35:04.685 --> 35:05.853
Who the hell cares?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.396
It was just
a stupid title.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.148
Not to me it wasn't!

35:09.232 --> 35:12.860
You all think that
this is just another one of Rita Farr's

35:12.944 --> 35:14.070
tiresome ego trips.

35:14.153 --> 35:16.280
But it had nothing
to do with that.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.865
It was about us.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.992
It was about all of us.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.955
When Niles died,
someone needed to hold this family together,

35:24.038 --> 35:25.206
so I did it.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.708
I never asked
for anything in return.

35:27.792 --> 35:31.212
But I have really
been struggling lately.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.548
I have
no one else in my life

35:33.631 --> 35:36.509
like you,
or Jane, or Cliff.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.221
All I have is us.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.764
And it would have
been nice

35:41.848 --> 35:44.517
if somebody had
stepped up for me

35:44.600 --> 35:47.353
the way that I have
stepped up for them.

35:49.313 --> 35:52.567
And at the very least,
come to dinner.

36:04.245 --> 36:07.832
It all happened so fast.
I never saw Teddy coming.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.417
[Nicholas] It's going
to be okay.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.878
I'm going to find
a way to fix you.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.713
We're going
to turn you back.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.673
You know
there's no turning me back.

36:15.756 --> 36:18.926
This is what I am now.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.928
This is who I am.

I don't think so.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.932
It's okay. [shushing]

36:25.016 --> 36:28.185
Now we can
really be together.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.563
If this is what it takes,
I'm okay with that.

36:30.646 --> 36:31.856
[Nicholas]
Well, I'm not.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.733
I will never
be okay with this.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.318
Teddy will pay
for what he did.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.986
That is not who you are.

36:37.069 --> 36:41.073
If you go down that road,
you'll be no better than him.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.702
- I'm nothing like him.
- Then prove it.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.245

[Larry] Hmm.

37:48.474 --> 37:51.602
Remember back in '72,
when you told me

37:51.686 --> 37:54.188
I couldn't pull off

40:33.973 --> 40:35.182
Whatever
you gotta tell yourself.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.517
[Rita, Larry
and Cliff laughing]

40:38.269 --> 40:40.146
[Larry] We've really
been to hell and back.

40:40.229 --> 40:43.816
- [Rita] Hmm.
- Kinda literally.

40:43.899 --> 40:46.318
[Cliff] When we die,
there better be some kind of express lane,

40:46.402 --> 40:50.364
because I am not getting
on that stupid boat again.

40:50.447 --> 40:53.367
If only
Niles could see us now.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.995
He can't.
We ate him, remember?

40:56.078 --> 40:57.788
[all laughing]

41:00.875 --> 41:03.127
Fucking gross, dude.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.170
[Larry] Well...

41:05.963 --> 41:07.590
[Cliff] Better times.

41:08.924 --> 41:09.884
[Larry] Were they?

41:12.636 --> 41:13.762
[Jane] Hmm.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.955
[Cliff] Is this
really the end?

41:40.039 --> 41:42.416
[Rita] Can we honestly
ask for more?

41:43.584 --> 41:45.336
I've lived two lifetimes.

41:45.419 --> 41:48.047
That's more than
anyone has a right to.

41:50.466 --> 41:54.678
This family of ours...

41:57.514 --> 41:59.308
we put it together.

41:59.391 --> 42:02.102
And it really stuck,
didn't it?

42:02.186 --> 42:04.146
[Rita laughing]

42:04.230 --> 42:07.524
I am so grateful for each
and every one of you.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.196
And Victor.
[chuckles]

42:12.279 --> 42:17.076
And as much as
it pains me to say, even Rouge.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.663
Where is she?

42:20.746 --> 42:23.540
How dare she miss
my kind words about her.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.918
Wait. She's not, um...

42:29.922 --> 42:31.048
[Rita sighs]

42:31.131 --> 42:32.967
Trying to get
our longevity back.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.469
- [Jane] Oh!
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

42:35.552 --> 42:37.554
What the hell
was she thinking?

42:37.638 --> 42:39.223
We told her not to go.

42:39.306 --> 42:42.142
Now we have to help her.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.978
[Cliff] What?

42:44.061 --> 42:46.313
No, you've said it.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.775
We told her not to go.
This is on her.

42:49.858 --> 42:50.943
Come on, people.

42:51.026 --> 42:52.987
She is risking her life
for ours.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.947
We have to do something.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.577
[Rita sputters]

43:03.455 --> 43:04.999
[Rita exhales]

43:05.082 --> 43:07.751
What do you say,
team? Hmm?

43:07.835 --> 43:12.006
One last mission
for old time's sake?

43:15.926 --> 43:19.263
[scoffs]
So disappointed in you.

43:19.805 --> 43:20.889
God!

43:20.973 --> 43:24.143
Look at me.
Ancient and decrepit.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.936
God only knows how old.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.521
If I can do this, then...

43:29.606 --> 43:30.482
[Larry] Rita!

43:31.650 --> 43:32.943
[Jane] Whoa.

43:37.614 --> 43:39.325
Okay, I'm not saying
we should do this.

43:39.408 --> 43:42.661
I'm not.
But we could rewrite history,

43:42.745 --> 43:46.832
and you could be
literally queen of the world.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.877
Oh, my God.
Love that.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.795
It'll totally humanize me.

43:51.879 --> 43:56.258
- Okay, so first, we start small
with the world, and then-- - Mmm-hmm.

43:56.342 --> 43:58.052
Then we go intergalactic.

43:58.135 --> 44:03.724
We expand our empire
to the farthest reaches of the universe.

44:03.807 --> 44:07.978
Isabel Feathers,
Queen of the Universe.

44:08.062 --> 44:12.024
Oh, it just feels
so... right.

44:12.566 --> 44:13.817
Right.

44:15.235 --> 44:16.612
Thank you.

44:16.695 --> 44:20.240
I know we've had our moments,
but I'm really happy

44:20.324 --> 44:23.160
I found someone
who finally gets me.

44:23.243 --> 44:24.495
Okay. Me, too.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.538
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
Yum, yum. Mmm.

44:27.664 --> 44:29.166
You hear that, Ma?

44:29.249 --> 44:31.877
I'm finally
getting out of Cloverton.

44:31.960 --> 44:34.546
Watch out, world,
here comes...

44:38.467 --> 44:39.885
Immortus.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.770
[sighs] Oh, fuck.

45:07.371 --> 45:08.997
[Larry] We have to help her.

45:10.791 --> 45:12.751
We have to get
our longevity back.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.671
Didn't you hear
what she said?

45:16.964 --> 45:19.675
She's lived
long enough, dude.

45:27.558 --> 45:28.851
[Larry] Please.

45:30.310 --> 45:32.229
I'm not ready
to say goodbye.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.281
We don't even know
if it would work.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.284
[Cliff] Does it matter?

45:48.245 --> 45:49.163
It's Rita.

46:00.257 --> 46:01.091
Fuck it.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.693
[tires screeching]

46:20.694 --> 46:22.362
[Jane and Larry grunting]

46:25.741 --> 46:28.118
[Larry] Oh, looks like
Isabel is really finding her audience.

46:31.288 --> 46:32.956
Where the fuck
is everybody?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.583
[creature growling in distance]

46:34.666 --> 46:37.252
[Cliff] What the hell was that?

46:40.714 --> 46:42.216
[Larry] Is that...

46:42.299 --> 46:44.051
A fucking Butt.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.178
[Teddy] Those are the fiends
who murdered our kind.

46:46.261 --> 46:49.348
I can think of no better way
to commence our holy war.

46:49.431 --> 46:51.975
What say you,
brothers and sisters?

46:52.059 --> 46:54.436
Who the fuck
is he talking to?

46:54.520 --> 46:55.729
[people clamoring in distance]

47:01.610 --> 47:02.986
[Cliff] Oh, fuck.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.448
[Teddy] Unclench.

47:06.532 --> 47:08.075
[Butts screaming]

47:17.251 --> 47:19.419
[Butts howling]

47:23.966 --> 47:26.593
Power comes at a cost,
you know?

47:27.511 --> 47:28.470
Who cares?

47:29.304 --> 47:30.430
I didn't.

47:30.514 --> 47:33.100
For a long time,
I really didn't.

47:33.183 --> 47:37.855
But when I saw a future
where everybody I cared for was dead,

47:37.938 --> 47:41.775
I instantly knew
why I wasn't there.

47:41.858 --> 47:44.528
I took
the wrong path, again.

47:46.196 --> 47:47.948
I can't repeat
that mistake.

47:49.533 --> 47:50.867
I've come so far.

48:00.002 --> 48:02.588
[Cliff] This is all my fault.
The Butts are taking over.

48:02.671 --> 48:04.172
We're about to be dead.

48:04.256 --> 48:05.966
Everything
we saw in the future is coming true.

48:06.049 --> 48:07.593
Not one thing's different.

48:07.676 --> 48:11.597
- [Butts growling]
- [Cliff] Oh, shit. They're coming.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.599
[Butts whining]

48:18.895 --> 48:19.980
- [Larry] What...
- [Cliff] The...

48:20.063 --> 48:21.898
Fuck.

48:23.442 --> 48:25.652
- Booyah.
- [Cliff] Holy shit.

48:25.736 --> 48:28.780
- BB-8 is back.
- Oh, hell yeah.

48:28.864 --> 48:30.073
[Cliff] Let's do this.

48:33.118 --> 48:34.411
[Butts growling]

48:37.122 --> 48:39.041
- [Butts growling]
- [Cliff] Oh, fuck.

48:39.124 --> 48:40.709
[Vic] There's way too many.

48:40.792 --> 48:43.086
- Let's fucking go!
- [Cliff] Fuck!

48:43.170 --> 48:44.504
Fuck my life!

48:44.588 --> 48:46.548
[Vic] Go, go, go! Come on!

48:49.301 --> 48:50.719
[Jane] Run away! Run away!

48:59.436 --> 49:02.022
Let her go,
you baritone bitch.

49:02.648 --> 49:04.024
Now I see.

49:04.107 --> 49:07.861
You would choose
these worthless insects...

49:07.944 --> 49:11.615
[in demonic voice]
...over me, your queen?

49:11.698 --> 49:16.703
[straining]
I'm not a bad person.

49:16.787 --> 49:23.043
I spent an eternity
trapped in hell because of you.

49:23.126 --> 49:27.214
[in normal voice]
Perhaps it's time I return the favor.

49:27.297 --> 49:30.676
I presume you're all here
because you're running out of time?

49:49.277 --> 49:51.571
- [Cliff] Whoa!
- [all groaning]

49:51.655 --> 49:54.741
[in demonic voice]
Take all the time you need.

49:54.825 --> 49:56.118
[Cliff] Ahhh!

49:56.201 --> 49:58.662
[Jane grunts] Fuck.

49:58.745 --> 50:01.498
[all screaming]

50:04.042 --> 50:05.836
[Madame Rouge screaming]
