01:04.596 --> 01:06.580
This is the Dragon-Taming Mace.

01:06.620 --> 01:08.620
Forged in iron from stardust.

01:08.644 --> 01:10.644
Harder than the Golden Stone.

01:10.668 --> 01:12.668
I grant the mace to you for safekeeping.

01:12.692 --> 01:14.692
Use it to defeat evil, as is your duty.

01:14.716 --> 01:17.516
Protect our nation,
keep all things in balance.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.540
If anyone, even me...

01:21.564 --> 01:23.564
Should threaten... Our nation...

01:23.588 --> 01:26.588
You are empowered...
To control them with the Mace.

01:28.512 --> 01:30.512
I am honored, Your Majesty!

01:39.536 --> 01:45.536
DEE DETECTIVE: THE FOUR HEAVENLY KINGS

03:09.584 --> 03:12.584
Your Majesty... you handed the
Dragon-Taming Mace to Dee.

03:12.608 --> 03:14.608
But what if he turned against us?

03:14.632 --> 03:16.632
Our nation will be helpless against him.

03:21.556 --> 03:23.556
Dee almost lost his life to the Sea Dragon.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.580
He saved me from death,
rescued our ministers.

03:25.604 --> 03:28.504
He's no conspirator or betrayer.

03:29.528 --> 03:32.528
That's your justification.

03:32.552 --> 03:34.552
But aren't you thinking of
using him against me?

03:34.576 --> 03:37.576
How can you think that, my consort?

03:37.600 --> 03:39.600
For your sake...

03:39.624 --> 03:42.524
I have ended dynasty long traditions.

03:42.548 --> 03:44.548
Repealed the old laws and made new ones.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.572
Now we rule together.

03:47.596 --> 03:49.596
I have done so much.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.520
How can you not trust me?

04:04.544 --> 04:06.544
Your Majesty, my Empress.

04:06.568 --> 04:08.568
Yuchi Zhenjin...

04:08.592 --> 04:12.592
I know that you and Dee are close
sworn brothers.

04:12.616 --> 04:16.516
But if I ordered you to take
the Mace from him...

04:16.540 --> 04:19.540
Could you do that?

04:21.564 --> 04:23.564
Your Majesty, if Dee loses the Mace...

04:23.588 --> 04:26.588
He will face the death penalty.

04:26.612 --> 04:29.512
If you follow my order...

04:29.536 --> 04:34.536
You have my solemn word... Dee and his
family will suffer no punishment.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.560
In that case, Your Majesty...
Nothing will stop me from serving you.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.584
Have you found the men I asked for?

04:51.508 --> 04:55.508
Your Majesty...
This man is from Huan Tian, ​​the Taoist.

04:56.532 --> 05:00.532
I am only... merely a man from <i>jianghu</i>,
Your Majesty.

05:00.556 --> 05:04.556
Huan Tian... ​​I hear tell you
can summon wind and rain.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.580
My talents are modest, Your Majesty.

05:06.604 --> 05:08.604
But as you commanded...

05:08.628 --> 05:10.628
I have brought men with great skills.

05:10.652 --> 05:12.652
They are at the court's service.

05:12.676 --> 05:15.576
Show me what they can do.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
Spectral Blades, from the Huandao Clan.

06:19.524 --> 06:22.524
"Samantabhadra."

06:35.548 --> 06:37.548
Night Ghost, from Qianshou Clan.

06:52.572 --> 06:54.572
My Lord, please...

07:05.596 --> 07:09.596
It's a trick cup! These are indeed
modest tricks of the <i>jianghu.</i>

07:10.520 --> 07:12.520
Your deceptions are an affront!

07:12.544 --> 07:17.544
- What is your name?
- Smoke Volant, from Xianqi Clan.

07:20.568 --> 07:23.568
Your Majesty... These are mere <i>jianghu</i>
trifles! Such charlatans......

07:23.592 --> 07:25.592
Should not be trusted.

07:25.616 --> 07:27.616
Huan Tian...

07:27.640 --> 07:29.640
These men are all you have to show me?

07:29.664 --> 07:31.564
Your Majesty...

07:31.588 --> 07:33.588
Since this gentleman mistrusts us...

07:33.612 --> 07:35.612
I will be bold enough to wager him.

07:35.636 --> 07:37.636
If his sword can strike
Your Majesty's shadow...

07:37.660 --> 07:40.560
I will submit to your punishment.

07:41.584 --> 07:43.584
How dare you?
You speak of Her Majesty's shadow?

07:43.608 --> 07:45.608
Your guilt is self-evident!

07:45.632 --> 07:47.632
Not guilty!

07:47.656 --> 07:50.556
- Your Majesty...
- Unsheath your blade!

07:50.580 --> 07:52.580
Immediately!

07:54.504 --> 07:56.504
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

08:04.558 --> 08:06.558
Hidden demon, show yourself!

08:51.582 --> 08:53.582
Water Moon, from Fuyin Clan.

08:55.506 --> 08:57.506
You're lucky...

08:57.530 --> 08:59.530
Your head is still on your body.

08:59.554 --> 09:02.554
Her Majesty's mercy has spared you.

09:02.578 --> 09:04.578
Show her your appreciation.

09:05.502 --> 09:08.502
The <i>jianghu</i> has remarkable talents.

09:08.526 --> 09:10.526
I'm happy with your service.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.550
Conceal yourselves nearby and await orders.

09:12.574 --> 09:15.574
I name you the Mystic Clan!

09:15.598 --> 09:17.598
Follow Yuchi's orders.

09:17.622 --> 09:19.622
Be ready to retrieve the Mace.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.646
Yes, Your Majesty.

09:24.570 --> 09:28.570
One moment, Your Majesty. This matter
is too weighty to trust to strangers.

09:28.594 --> 09:30.594
I can retrieve the Mace alone.

09:30.618 --> 09:32.618
They are here to help you.

09:32.642 --> 09:35.542
I leave you to proceed.

09:38.566 --> 09:40.566
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS

09:40.590 --> 09:42.590
Master!

09:42.614 --> 09:44.614
Have you seen Master Dee?

09:44.638 --> 09:46.638
Isn't he in his room?

09:46.662 --> 09:48.662
Master, a message from the Duty Office.

09:48.686 --> 09:51.586
A strange theft from the painter Leng Yu!

09:51.610 --> 09:53.610
Master!

09:54.534 --> 09:56.534
I know, get the horses ready!

09:57.558 --> 09:59.558
He's always popping up without
warning these days.

10:20.582 --> 10:22.582
You can find Dee's official
residence on that map.

10:22.606 --> 10:24.606
And how to take the Mace.

10:24.630 --> 10:26.630
You people will have to handle it!

10:35.554 --> 10:37.554
What's that?

10:54.578 --> 10:56.578
Some strange design appeared
on the ground, like a map.

10:56.602 --> 10:58.602
Did you see it?

11:04.526 --> 11:06.526
LENG YU'S STUDIO

11:06.550 --> 11:08.550
Lord Dee is here.

11:17.574 --> 11:20.574
- Please, my lord.
<i>- The victim is Leng Yu, a famous painter.</i>

11:20.598 --> 11:23.598
<i>He does old style pictures of maids...</i>

11:23.622 --> 11:25.622
<i>Flowers, horses, that kind of thing.</i>

11:25.646 --> 11:27.646
<i>Very true to life.</i>

11:27.670 --> 11:29.670
<i>Much praised.</i>

11:29.694 --> 11:31.694
<i>It went to his head.</i>

11:31.718 --> 11:34.518
<i>He's been working on a new picture.</i>

11:34.542 --> 11:36.542
<i>"Steeds Crossing the River".</i>

11:36.566 --> 11:39.566
<i>Someone broke in and stole it.</i>

11:44.590 --> 11:46.590
<i>They set fire to his other paintings.</i>

11:46.614 --> 11:48.614
<i>The losses are great.</i>

11:48.638 --> 11:50.638
<i>Even scarier...</i>

11:50.662 --> 11:52.662
<i>His folks have gone missing.</i>

11:52.686 --> 11:54.686
<i>No-one knows where they are.</i>

12:47.510 --> 12:49.510
The thief left too many clues.

12:50.534 --> 12:52.534
- I think...
- Shh...

12:59.558 --> 13:01.558
You see, I ...

13:09.582 --> 13:11.582
- Who are you people?
- From the Bureau of Investigations.

13:11.606 --> 13:13.606
You are painter Leng?

13:13.630 --> 13:16.530
- Bureau of Investigations?
- Don't be rash, Mr. Leng.

13:16.554 --> 13:18.554
Was it you who reported this?

13:35.578 --> 13:37.578
- See that?
- What was it?

13:37.602 --> 13:39.602
Fireflies!

13:39.626 --> 13:41.626
It's not quite spring yet.
How could that be?

14:05.550 --> 14:07.550
This is Dee's bedroom.

14:07.574 --> 14:10.574
The room is arranged in the
Nine-Star pattern.

14:10.598 --> 14:13.598
This is where things should be hidden.

14:13.622 --> 14:17.522
He wants us to think the Mace
is hidden here.

14:17.546 --> 14:19.626
We should think the opposite way
to find it!

14:27.570 --> 14:30.570
How many people have seen
"Steeds Crossing the River"?

14:30.594 --> 14:32.594
No-one!

14:33.518 --> 14:35.518
Are you trying to tell me something?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.542
No.

14:37.566 --> 14:39.566
You're doing it again!
Why do you keep blinking at me?

14:39.590 --> 14:41.590
I have an eye problem.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.614
It's... congenital.

14:44.538 --> 14:46.538
A congenital eye problem?

14:46.562 --> 14:49.562
- I think you're afraid of something.
- No, I'm not.

14:49.586 --> 14:51.586
I think this fellow staged the whole thing.

14:51.610 --> 14:53.610
Maybe trying to boost his prices.

14:53.634 --> 14:55.634
I doubt it. If that was it...

14:55.658 --> 14:57.658
Why would he need to hide his family?

14:57.682 --> 15:00.582
Right, he wouldn't need to do that.

15:01.506 --> 15:02.506
Those footprints...

15:02.530 --> 15:04.530
All of the clues are just a trap.

15:04.554 --> 15:07.554
Someone wants us to spend time here
at this very moment.

15:07.578 --> 15:10.578
They are waiting for us to take the bait.

15:10.602 --> 15:12.602
Yes! But...

15:12.626 --> 15:15.526
The footprints show that the thief...
came from that direction.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.550
Look! There are footprints here too.

15:20.574 --> 15:22.574
Could something be hidden there?

15:26.598 --> 15:29.598
My painting!

15:33.522 --> 15:34.822
Don't move!

15:34.823 --> 15:36.523
Stay right there.

15:36.547 --> 15:38.547
Since the painting is still here...

15:38.571 --> 15:41.571
...we're being tricked in some way.

15:42.595 --> 15:44.595
Don't touch it!

15:49.519 --> 15:51.519
- There's poison!
- What is it?

15:53.543 --> 15:55.543
Careful, everyone, there's poison.

15:58.567 --> 16:00.187
Stay still, let's seal off your acupoints.

16:00.212 --> 16:00.751
You...

16:08.591 --> 16:10.591
The dust on the desk is poisoned too!

16:10.615 --> 16:12.615
Hold your breath.

16:29.539 --> 16:31.539
On the roof!

16:40.563 --> 16:42.563
It's a dummy!

16:45.587 --> 16:47.587
Smoke Volant was spotted.

16:47.611 --> 16:49.611
If the poison doesn't kill Dee...

16:49.635 --> 16:51.535
We'll finish him off...

16:51.559 --> 16:53.559
- ... on his way back to the Bureau.
- Good!

16:53.583 --> 16:55.583
Let's go!

16:56.507 --> 16:58.507
Stop!

16:59.531 --> 17:01.531
You're under my command.

17:01.555 --> 17:03.555
Who told you to poison him?

17:03.579 --> 17:05.579
You're asking for it!

17:05.603 --> 17:06.502
Han Ping.

17:06.527 --> 17:09.527
- Take off your robe.
- Don't touch mine, it's poisoned.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.550
This is how we get things done!

17:12.575 --> 17:15.575
Sir... Are you trying to stop
us getting paid?

17:15.598 --> 17:17.598
Ridiculous!

17:17.623 --> 17:22.522
Your blood should have flowed days ago!

17:22.547 --> 17:24.547
Attack a member of the Golden Guard...

17:24.570 --> 17:26.570
... and you attack the Emperor himself.

17:26.595 --> 17:28.595
You dare?

17:30.519 --> 17:32.519
The thief is playing with us.

17:32.543 --> 17:34.520
Yi An, Zhou Jin... Stay right behind me.

17:34.567 --> 17:35.967
Wait for me at the western corner.

17:35.968 --> 17:37.968
- Let's bring him into the open.
- Yes sir!

17:40.592 --> 17:42.592
That's the best you can do?

17:42.616 --> 17:44.616
You seem quite timorous.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.540
I think we'll see your end today.

17:47.564 --> 17:49.564
Let's go.

18:30.588 --> 18:32.588
- Who are you?
- What are you doing there?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.612
Throw ropes around her!

18:38.536 --> 18:40.536
Watch her feet!

18:52.560 --> 18:54.560
- Dee!
- You can't go anywhere.

19:03.584 --> 19:05.584
Watch out!

19:54.508 --> 19:56.508
- Ha ha ha...
- Up there!

19:57.473 --> 19:58.532
Don't let him get away!

20:23.556 --> 20:25.556
Move away from there!

20:38.580 --> 20:40.580
- Master.
- I'm alright.

20:40.604 --> 20:42.604
- How about you two?
- Alright.

20:43.528 --> 20:45.528
What was all that for?

20:45.552 --> 20:47.552
It seems to me... Someone set all this up.

20:47.576 --> 20:49.576
They just wanted us out of the Bureau.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.500
But look what's happened now.
They're targeting us too.

21:06.524 --> 21:08.524
Night Ghost...

21:08.548 --> 21:10.548
This is too easy.

21:11.572 --> 21:13.572
Watch out!

21:19.596 --> 21:21.596
- What the...?
- The alarm!

21:21.620 --> 21:23.620
Quick!

21:27.544 --> 21:29.544
It's a trap. Let's get out now.

21:35.568 --> 21:37.568
Careful.

21:56.592 --> 21:58.592
Master Dee knew they'd come.

21:59.516 --> 22:01.516
See what instructions Master left for us.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.540
"Let them escape."

22:11.564 --> 22:13.564
That Dee Renjie...

22:13.588 --> 22:16.588
What is that man thinking?

22:20.512 --> 22:22.512
Yuchi Zhenjin...

22:22.536 --> 22:24.536
You and the Mystic Clan lost
the first round...

22:26.560 --> 22:29.560
... of your challenge to Dee.

22:29.584 --> 22:31.584
You spirited away Leng's family.

22:31.608 --> 22:34.508
What are you going to do with them?

22:34.532 --> 22:36.532
Lord Yuchi planned this strategy.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.556
That's why it failed.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.580
Maybe I suggest... that Your Majesty...

22:40.604 --> 22:42.604
makes Yuchi follow ordes!

22:42.628 --> 22:44.628
That's enough!

22:44.652 --> 22:47.552
How dare you?
You were the one who didn't follow orders!

22:47.576 --> 22:49.576
And you are not ashamed to lie.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.500
Your Majesty...
Shouldn't the problem be solved...

22:53.524 --> 22:54.563
By the one who started it?

22:54.570 --> 22:56.524
The Dragon-Taming Mace is vital
to the nation's future.

22:56.548 --> 22:58.548
So, if I am allowed to make any advice...

22:58.572 --> 23:00.572
The Emperor should take it back from Dee.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.596
Advise?

23:03.520 --> 23:05.520
You think that would help?

23:07.544 --> 23:10.544
Back when the Tang Dynasty
was being built...

23:10.568 --> 23:13.568
...some predicted future struggles
within the royal family.

23:13.592 --> 23:16.592
They tried to "advise" the Emperor.

23:16.616 --> 23:18.616
But he wouldn't listen.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.540
Two years later the struggle broke out.

23:21.564 --> 23:25.564
It was known as the
"Xuanwu Gate Rebellion".

23:25.588 --> 23:28.588
You really think "advice" will help?

23:41.512 --> 23:43.512
Dee Renjie...

23:43.536 --> 23:44.559
SANZANG TEMPLE

23:44.560 --> 23:46.560
The emperor now values you highly.

23:46.584 --> 23:49.584
And is waiting for you.

23:49.608 --> 23:51.608
You should be proud of yourself.

23:51.632 --> 23:54.532
But you come to this ruined temple
to see me.

23:54.556 --> 23:58.556
What worries lies deep in your heart?

23:58.580 --> 24:00.580
Give me your hand.

24:13.504 --> 24:15.504
Hell is full of sufferers.

24:15.528 --> 24:17.528
So enlightenment must wait.

24:17.552 --> 24:19.552
Well said, well said.

24:20.576 --> 24:23.576
What I wrote on your palm was spontaneous.

24:23.600 --> 24:28.500
What you said was from your
innermost being.

24:29.524 --> 24:32.524
Each person has inner demons.

24:32.548 --> 24:35.548
When they loom up...

24:35.572 --> 24:37.572
They cannot be avoided.

24:37.596 --> 24:39.596
When that day comes...

24:40.520 --> 24:42.520
This token will find me.

24:45.544 --> 24:47.544
Yuan Ce...

24:47.568 --> 24:50.568
Hell is full of sufferers.
So enlightenment must wait.

24:51.592 --> 24:54.592
I must enter hell to save others.

25:07.516 --> 25:09.516
Master Dee!

25:09.540 --> 25:11.540
Master Dee!

25:14.564 --> 25:16.564
Dee!

25:41.588 --> 25:44.588
Master Dee, why has this sickness returned?

25:46.512 --> 25:50.512
Something in my mind is affecting my body.

25:50.536 --> 25:54.536
The Dragon-Taming Mace
brings many troubles.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.560
You always solve such problems.

25:58.584 --> 26:01.584
But maybe this time I cannot.

26:12.508 --> 26:14.508
Wait here.

26:14.532 --> 26:16.532
Yes.

26:23.556 --> 26:26.556
Lord, this is such a terrible dungeon.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.580
I've accompanied Her Majesty
here many times.

26:29.604 --> 26:31.604
But I have never dared ask...

26:31.628 --> 26:34.528
Who is it that is confined here?

26:37.552 --> 26:39.552
It's the minister who predicted the
Xuanwu Gate Rebellion.

26:39.576 --> 26:42.576
The man whose advice was ignored.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
He was locked in here...

26:44.624 --> 26:46.624
...by the Emperor who led the Rebellion.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.648
He was stripped of his rank
and family name.

26:48.672 --> 26:51.572
His body was tortured.

26:51.596 --> 26:53.596
They even disfigured his face.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.520
Now he's known as "The Faceless Lord".

27:02.544 --> 27:04.544
Old one...

27:06.568 --> 27:08.568
You've come again.

27:10.592 --> 27:13.592
Wait for me over there. I'll wait here.

27:14.516 --> 27:16.516
Yes, my Lord.

27:19.540 --> 27:21.540
All those years ago...

27:21.564 --> 27:24.564
When you first came to see me...

27:25.588 --> 27:28.588
You asked me how to become the Empress.

27:28.612 --> 27:33.512
You promised you would rehabilitate me.

27:33.536 --> 27:35.536
And my family.

27:35.560 --> 27:39.560
Now you are indeed the Empress!

27:39.584 --> 27:43.584
What is there left to trouble you?

27:44.508 --> 27:46.508
Dee Renjie now holds the
Dragon-Taming Mace.

27:46.532 --> 27:49.532
You advised me to convene the Mystic Clan.

27:49.556 --> 27:51.556
But they are no match for Dee.

28:03.580 --> 28:06.580
You need to boost their
standing in the court.

28:06.604 --> 28:10.504
That's how you make yourself more powerful!

28:12.528 --> 28:14.528
Take over the the Bureau of Investigations.

28:14.552 --> 28:16.552
Make Dee hand over the Mace.

28:16.576 --> 28:19.576
How can I take over the Bureau?

28:20.500 --> 28:22.500
How can I force Dee to hand over the Mace?

28:25.524 --> 28:27.524
Ha ha ha...

28:34.548 --> 28:36.548
By the Lords of heaven...

28:36.572 --> 28:38.572
I am Yuchi Zhenjin of
His Majesty's Golden Guards.

28:38.596 --> 28:40.596
By command of the Empress...

28:40.620 --> 28:42.620
I am here for the training exercises.

29:20.544 --> 29:22.544
Do you take us for fools?

29:22.568 --> 29:24.568
Are you here to challenge the Bureau?
Tell me, what's the point of this training?

29:24.592 --> 29:26.592
I think you shameless people...

29:26.616 --> 29:29.516
- ...are here to go after Master Dee!
- That's absurd.

29:29.540 --> 29:32.540
I'm doing my duty here.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.564
I should come after you!

29:34.588 --> 29:36.588
That's fine.

29:36.612 --> 29:39.512
Next time you ask me for medical treatment,
I'll have a snake poison you...

29:39.536 --> 29:41.536
And then I'll save you at the
point of death!

29:41.560 --> 29:43.560
How about that?

29:43.584 --> 29:45.584
Ha ha ha...

29:45.608 --> 29:47.608
Ha ha ha...

29:47.632 --> 29:49.632
Ha!

29:50.556 --> 29:52.556
Master Dee, you really want to do that?

29:56.580 --> 29:58.580
- He's really doing it!
- Take care, Master Dee!

29:58.604 --> 30:01.504
No one can do that! It's too unstable!

30:01.528 --> 30:04.528
Idiot! Your Golden Guard came up
with this stunt, didn't they?

30:04.552 --> 30:06.552
No one could stand up there!

30:10.576 --> 30:12.576
Call an end to it!

30:21.500 --> 30:23.500
Master!

30:23.524 --> 30:25.524
I'm alright.

30:28.548 --> 30:31.548
The trick you taught me actually did work.

30:32.572 --> 30:34.572
If you lose balance...

30:34.596 --> 30:36.596
You can flip in mid-air...

30:36.620 --> 30:38.620
And that helps decrease the impact.

30:38.644 --> 30:40.644
Master Dee... He's trying to trap you.

30:40.668 --> 30:42.668
Don't trust him.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.592
Are you alright?

30:46.616 --> 30:48.616
He's fine.

30:49.540 --> 30:52.540
Yuchi, come with me.
I have something for you.

31:15.564 --> 31:18.564
Yuchi, I know the Empress commanded you.

31:19.588 --> 31:22.588
And I know that many times...
You have shown your humanity.

31:22.612 --> 31:24.612
You are a dutiful officer.

31:25.536 --> 31:27.536
Dee...

31:27.560 --> 31:30.560
I feel ashamed to face such an old friend.

31:32.584 --> 31:34.584
This is for you.

31:38.508 --> 31:40.508
This is from the time
we fought the sea dragon.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.532
I made this while I was defending
ShallowTower.

31:43.556 --> 31:45.556
You're giving it back?

31:47.580 --> 31:49.580
Are you making fun of me?

31:49.604 --> 31:51.604
Her Majesty favors you,

31:51.628 --> 31:53.628
but both of us are embattled.

31:53.652 --> 31:55.652
We need to keep an eye on
the bigger picture.

31:55.676 --> 31:58.576
And I need your help.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.200
So I've written some lines for you...
in the corner of your picture.

32:06.524 --> 32:08.524
"The Four Heavenly Kings bless
our country."

32:08.548 --> 32:11.548
"Great virtue is hidden in our world."

32:11.572 --> 32:13.572
"A secretive person seeks it."

32:13.596 --> 32:16.596
"Cultivating life, holding a blade."

32:17.520 --> 32:19.520
Can't make head or tail of it, Dee!

32:19.544 --> 32:21.544
Let it sink in.

32:21.568 --> 32:24.568
This Bureau may turn to
your Golden Guard...

32:24.592 --> 32:26.592
... for help in the future.

32:27.516 --> 32:29.516
You're very smart.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.589
Instead of arousing Her
Majesty's suspicions...

32:30.593 --> 32:32.604
...why not set out to win her trust?

32:33.564 --> 32:37.564
If the Empress transferred her favor to me,
then she wouldn't cause me trouble.

32:37.588 --> 32:39.588
You would!

32:42.512 --> 32:44.512
Absolutely not!

32:44.536 --> 32:46.536
I also want to live free and honest.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.560
Not caught up in intrigues.

32:48.584 --> 32:50.584
Free and honest?

32:50.608 --> 32:53.508
Look at the way you're dressed!
You belong in that armor.

32:55.532 --> 32:57.532
You jest!
This heavy armor bears...

32:57.556 --> 32:59.556
...no comparison with the
Dragon-Taming Mace.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.580
Neither of us have an easy path.

33:06.604 --> 33:10.504
Who can say what the future will bring?

33:17.528 --> 33:20.528
Take care of yourself, sworn brother!

33:27.552 --> 33:29.552
Yes, sworn brother!

33:29.576 --> 33:33.576
Take care!

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
Sha Tuo...

33:59.524 --> 34:02.524
Do you realize we've been spied on.

34:02.548 --> 34:04.548
By who?

34:04.572 --> 34:06.572
Who'd dare to spy on the
Bureau of Investigations?

34:06.596 --> 34:08.596
The one who tried to steal the Mace.

34:10.580 --> 34:13.580
They failed last time.
But they'll be back very soon.

34:13.603 --> 34:16.504
And it will be an open attack.

34:17.527 --> 34:19.527
An open attack?

34:21.552 --> 34:23.552
Dee...

34:23.576 --> 34:25.576
When you were given the
Dragon-Taming Mace...

34:25.600 --> 34:28.500
Was it good or bad luck for you?

34:32.524 --> 34:35.524
- Here comes another one.
- Yes, another magician type is here.

34:37.547 --> 34:40.388
Our Empress... likes watching their tricks.
Many are summoned to the palace.

34:40.572 --> 34:41.674
Learning magic tricks is popular now.

34:41.678 --> 34:43.572
Yes, everyone is following suit.

34:43.596 --> 34:45.596
No one cares about trades.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.620
Eveyone's abandoning their trades.

34:47.643 --> 34:49.643
And trying to learn magic tricks instead!

34:49.668 --> 34:51.668
You bet! Those magic tricks...

34:51.692 --> 34:53.692
...can bring the benefits rolling in!

34:55.516 --> 34:57.516
Boss!

35:09.540 --> 35:11.540
It's that mysterious design again!

36:10.564 --> 36:13.564
Sir, the yams have arrived!

36:13.588 --> 36:16.588
I've packed them up for you.

36:16.612 --> 36:17.612
Come, come!

36:17.636 --> 36:19.636
- I'm waiting for you to pick them up.
- Boss, are you from Tiele too?

36:19.660 --> 36:21.660
Tiele dialect!

36:21.684 --> 36:23.684
You haven't paid yet.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.508
Boss, it's a mistake,
I didn't order them.

36:25.532 --> 36:27.532
No mistake! It's me!

36:28.556 --> 36:30.556
Dee...

36:31.580 --> 36:33.580
You're in danger! Get out of here.

36:39.504 --> 36:41.504
We're being watched... Mount up!

36:41.528 --> 36:43.528
- But you...
- Listen, I'll be out of sight for a while.

36:43.552 --> 36:45.552
If you need me,
see the note in the medicine box.

36:46.576 --> 36:48.576
Thank you, sir.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.500
Don't move!
What kind of disguising skill is this?

36:59.524 --> 37:01.524
Damn you!

37:11.548 --> 37:13.548
Spying on me?

37:29.572 --> 37:32.572
Those <i>jianghu</i> magicians are useless.

37:32.596 --> 37:36.596
I thought they could be used to
get the Mace.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.620
And to finish off Dee Renjie.

37:39.544 --> 37:42.544
But they're just getting in the way.

37:42.568 --> 37:45.568
Let's kill them all.

37:45.592 --> 37:48.592
Meanwhile...

37:48.616 --> 37:50.616
This power hungry demon...

37:50.640 --> 37:52.640
"EMPRESS"

37:52.664 --> 37:55.564
is controlled by our sorcerer.

37:55.588 --> 37:59.588
Let's see how she
takes over the Bureau tomorrow!

38:04.512 --> 38:07.712
The Empress is here! She's outside
the Bureau of Investigations gate!

38:10.536 --> 38:12.536
The Empress is here!

38:12.560 --> 38:14.560
Outside the Bureau of Investigations gate!

38:16.584 --> 38:18.584
All ranks assembled!
Prepare to greet Her Majesty.

38:18.608 --> 38:21.508
Prepare to greet Her Majesty.

38:21.532 --> 38:23.532
What? Master Dee was right again!

38:24.556 --> 38:26.556
They're almost here.

38:26.580 --> 38:28.580
So flagrant! Where are you, Dee?

38:33.504 --> 38:35.504
Oh yes, the medicine chest.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.528
This is it!

39:02.552 --> 39:04.552
A report from the Imperial Court!

39:05.576 --> 39:08.576
A member of the royal family
has been wounded by this Mace.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
Is it the authentic Dragon-Taming Mace?

39:11.524 --> 39:16.524
I command Master Dee to show
the Mace in his keeping.

39:16.548 --> 39:18.548
Then we will know for sure.

39:20.572 --> 39:22.572
Your Majesty...

39:24.596 --> 39:26.596
Master Dee is in his home town on
family business.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.520
As for the Dragon-Taming Mace...

39:32.544 --> 39:35.544
We actually...
don't know where it's kept.

39:36.568 --> 39:38.568
Dee Renjie is absent.

39:39.592 --> 39:41.592
That's a perfect reason for the Empress...

39:41.616 --> 39:43.616
... to take control of the Bureau.

39:53.540 --> 39:55.540
Dee Renjie!

39:55.564 --> 39:57.564
Leader of the Bureau of Investigations!

39:57.588 --> 39:59.588
You neglect your duties!

39:59.612 --> 40:01.612
It is unthinkable!

40:03.536 --> 40:06.536
The Bureau must have a leader.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.560
For public safety,
I take command of the Bureau.

40:22.584 --> 40:24.584
Now I must inspect the premises.

40:24.608 --> 40:27.508
- Guide me!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

40:29.532 --> 40:31.532
Please, Your Majesty.

40:32.556 --> 40:34.556
Your Majesty.

40:43.580 --> 40:45.580
Master Sha Tuo.

40:50.504 --> 40:52.504
Your Majesty...

40:52.528 --> 40:54.528
The Bureau's scale is modest,
you have seen it all...

40:54.552 --> 40:56.552
Except the bathing area, the kitchen.

40:56.576 --> 40:58.576
And... the toilets.

41:02.500 --> 41:05.500
Then assist me... to inspect those places.

41:05.524 --> 41:08.524
Search diligently and report to me.

41:08.548 --> 41:10.548
Yes, Your Majesty.

41:11.572 --> 41:13.572
Sir...

41:13.596 --> 41:15.596
The toilets are nearby.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.620
So let's start there.

41:17.644 --> 41:19.644
More than a hundred latrines in
each toilet!

41:19.668 --> 41:22.568
Don't think you can finish it,
better shovel the shit back.

41:23.592 --> 41:25.592
BATH HOUSE

41:26.516 --> 41:28.516
- Master Sha Tuo...
- Ignore me.

42:36.540 --> 42:38.540
Where?

42:50.564 --> 42:53.564
Dee! There you are.

42:56.588 --> 42:58.588
Sorcery...

42:58.612 --> 43:00.612
Dee!

43:00.636 --> 43:02.636
Dee!

43:03.560 --> 43:05.560
That formula needs improvements.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.584
They're here! Just as you said!

43:08.608 --> 43:10.608
The Empress brought in these
<i>jianghu</i> charlatans.

43:10.632 --> 43:12.632
They're looking for the Mace.

43:14.556 --> 43:16.556
The Dragon-Taming Mace.
Is it somewhere safe?

43:18.580 --> 43:20.580
It's a grave situation.

43:20.604 --> 43:22.604
So how come you're so excited?

43:22.628 --> 43:25.528
Oh, congratulations.
You've encountered someone?

43:27.552 --> 43:29.552
You're right! A woman assassin!

43:30.576 --> 43:32.576
Excellent.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.600
From now on...

43:34.624 --> 43:36.624
Your mission is to watch her closely.

43:36.648 --> 43:39.548
And maybe develop your relationship.

43:39.572 --> 43:41.572
Develop our relationship?
I don't think so.

43:41.596 --> 43:44.596
She looks fierce, she scares me.

43:44.620 --> 43:46.620
Never mind that. It's Bureau work.

43:46.644 --> 43:48.644
We're always dealing with dangerous types.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.668
You should be used to it.

43:50.692 --> 43:52.692
The Empress makes is making big trouble.

43:52.716 --> 43:54.716
I'm not in the mood for love.

43:54.740 --> 43:56.740
That design!

43:57.564 --> 43:59.564
I've seen it before,
just outside the Bureau.

43:59.588 --> 44:01.588
Yes, I've been looking into it.

44:05.512 --> 44:07.512
It's called the "Zhanbojia".

44:07.536 --> 44:09.536
It's the symbol of a clan in India.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.560
They practice sorcerous possession.

44:11.584 --> 44:14.584
They can control minds...

44:14.608 --> 44:16.608
And manipulate actions.

44:16.632 --> 44:18.632
Their adherents found their way
here long ago.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.556
They helped the late Emperor
build our great dynasty.

44:21.580 --> 44:23.580
So he named them the Wind Warriors.

44:23.604 --> 44:27.504
But he came to mistrust them
and locked them up.

44:27.528 --> 44:29.528
They've been invisible for years.

44:29.552 --> 44:33.552
But now this symbol is appearing
in this city.

44:33.576 --> 44:35.736
I think there are renegade disciples
behind it.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.500
Dangerous people with weird skills.

44:40.524 --> 44:43.524
If they turn the Empress
against the Bureau...

44:43.548 --> 44:45.548
...it will be a very serious matter.

44:46.572 --> 44:48.572
The Empress and the <i>jianghu</i> sorcery...

44:48.596 --> 44:50.596
There will be terrible consequences.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.520
You've been here too long,
you should go back!

44:55.544 --> 44:57.544
Go on, hurry back!

45:16.568 --> 45:18.568
Miss! What the...

45:18.592 --> 45:20.592
You ugly man, stop pretending.

45:20.616 --> 45:22.736
Why did you take so long to bathe?
Some problem?

45:24.540 --> 45:27.540
You were watching me!
You know how long I took!

45:28.564 --> 45:31.564
If I want to watch, I watch.

45:31.588 --> 45:33.588
You like bathing, don't you?

45:33.612 --> 45:36.512
Go on! I'll watch!

45:42.536 --> 45:44.536
Understood.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.560
We should go.

45:47.584 --> 45:49.584
That does it. You have no idea...

45:49.608 --> 45:51.608
There's a lot of gossip
in the Bureau of Investigations.

45:51.632 --> 45:53.632
Seeing us together, there may be rumors.

45:53.656 --> 45:55.656
Please tell Her Majesty that I'm blameless.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.680
Then she'll let me off.

45:57.704 --> 45:59.504
That's enough!

45:59.528 --> 46:01.528
I'll advise the Empress to castrate you!

46:01.552 --> 46:03.552
That will end any rumors.

46:05.576 --> 46:07.576
I've seen enough for today.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.600
I'll come back tomorrow.

46:11.524 --> 46:12.524
Rumors? Pah!

46:12.548 --> 46:15.548
When will you bathe? I'll watch you!

46:24.572 --> 46:26.572
Her Majesty favors you...

46:26.596 --> 46:28.596
We need to keep an eye on
the bigger picture.

46:28.620 --> 46:30.620
I've written some lines for you...

46:30.644 --> 46:32.644
in the corner of your picture.

46:33.568 --> 46:35.568
"The Four Heavenly Kings bless
our country."

46:36.592 --> 46:38.592
"Cultivating life, holding a blade."

46:40.516 --> 46:42.516
A blade?

46:42.540 --> 46:44.540
A Mace?

46:49.564 --> 46:51.564
The Dragon-Taming Mace!

46:54.588 --> 46:57.588
The lines mention the Four Heavenly Kings.

46:57.589 --> 46:59.589
"Great virtue is hidden in our world."

46:59.613 --> 47:01.613
"Great Virtue" is an archway
in the city south.

47:01.637 --> 47:03.637
Very close to the Temple of Heavenly Kings!

47:03.661 --> 47:06.561
So perhaps the Dragon-Taming Mace...

47:12.585 --> 47:14.585
"Cultivating life"...

47:15.609 --> 47:17.609
That represents Heavenly King of Growth!

47:19.533 --> 47:21.533
The "blade"...

47:45.557 --> 47:47.557
The Dragon-Taming Mace!

47:49.581 --> 47:51.581
We need to keep an eye on
the bigger picture...

47:51.605 --> 47:53.605
The Bureau may turn to
your Golden Guard...

47:53.629 --> 47:55.629
...for help in the future.

47:56.553 --> 47:58.553
Our help in the future?

47:58.577 --> 48:01.577
He wants me to protect
the Dragon-Taming Mace!

48:15.501 --> 48:17.501
Come, come.

48:18.525 --> 48:21.525
Hand me the Dragon-Taming Mace.
I will take credit for finding it.

48:21.549 --> 48:23.549
In my eyes, you're worthless.

48:23.573 --> 48:27.573
Your speak more nonsense than Huan Tian!

48:28.597 --> 48:30.597
You got here...

48:30.621 --> 48:32.621
... just in time to die.

50:00.545 --> 50:02.545
Ha ha ha...

50:26.569 --> 50:28.569
The Dragon-Taming Mace.

51:04.593 --> 51:07.593
Forged in iron from stardust!

51:07.617 --> 51:10.517
Harder than the Golden Stone.

51:25.565 --> 51:28.565
Your Majesty,
if Dee loses the Dragon-Taming Mace...

51:28.589 --> 51:30.589
He will face the death penalty.

51:30.613 --> 51:32.613
I am afraid that...

51:32.637 --> 51:34.637
If you follow my order...

51:34.661 --> 51:36.661
You have my solemn word,

51:36.685 --> 51:39.585
Dee and his family will suffer
no punishment.

51:39.609 --> 51:41.609
In that case, Your Majesty...

51:41.633 --> 51:44.533
Nothng will stop me from serving you.

52:09.557 --> 52:11.557
Lord Yuchi, please wait outside.

52:13.581 --> 52:15.581
You're here!

52:16.505 --> 52:19.505
Lord Yuchi... You were indisposed today.

52:19.529 --> 52:22.529
You missed important developments.
As Her Majesty's right hand man...

52:22.553 --> 52:24.553
I worry about your condition.

52:24.577 --> 52:26.577
Please take care.

52:26.601 --> 52:29.501
I heard about you at the Bureau of
Investigations in quite a tight corner.

52:29.525 --> 52:31.525
You should take care too.

52:31.549 --> 52:33.549
Her Majesty is here.

52:34.573 --> 52:36.573
Yuchi Zhenjin...

52:37.597 --> 52:39.677
Today you must congratulate
Huan Tian Zhenren.

52:41.521 --> 52:44.521
I have promoted him...
... to the rank of Imperial Advisor.

52:46.545 --> 52:48.545
The Emperor is also eager to see...

52:48.569 --> 52:52.569
Huan Tian Zhenren's powers.
To see if he can replace Dee Renjie.

52:53.593 --> 52:56.593
Your Majesty,
Imperial Advisor is a key role.

52:56.617 --> 52:58.617
Please reconsider.

52:59.541 --> 53:01.541
Yuchi...

53:01.565 --> 53:03.565
What happened to your face?

53:03.589 --> 53:05.589
A training accident.

53:08.513 --> 53:11.513
Smoke Volant...
You should respect the officer!

53:11.537 --> 53:13.537
Yuchi...

53:13.561 --> 53:16.561
You did your best.

53:16.585 --> 53:19.585
Since you need time to recover...

53:19.609 --> 53:21.609
...please rest and wait for your orders.

53:21.633 --> 53:25.533
The Imperial Advisor can deal
with other matters.

53:30.557 --> 53:32.557
Yes, Your Majesty.

53:32.581 --> 53:34.581
Zhenren...

53:34.605 --> 53:36.605
I hear you are resourceful.

53:36.629 --> 53:38.629
You solve mysteries and defeat devils.

53:38.653 --> 53:41.553
Even more talented than Dee Renjie!

53:41.577 --> 53:44.577
Kindly show me your skills.

53:44.601 --> 53:46.601
What can you do?

53:46.625 --> 53:49.525
Your Majesty, it's my honor!

53:49.549 --> 53:52.549
I'll control the elements
to bless this great dynasty!

53:52.573 --> 53:54.573
Long live of our Noble Empress!

54:04.597 --> 54:06.597
No!

54:26.521 --> 54:29.521
Now see my thunder beads!

54:36.545 --> 54:38.545
Those are illusions made by machinery.

54:38.569 --> 54:40.569
No more than cheap trickery.

54:40.593 --> 54:42.593
They don't amount to much.

54:42.617 --> 54:48.517
Watch carefully, there's more to see.

55:04.541 --> 55:06.541
It's raining!

55:09.565 --> 55:11.565
It tastes so sweet!

55:11.589 --> 55:14.589
It's rain from heaven,
real rain from heaven!

55:14.613 --> 55:16.613
Tiger in the wind, dragon in the clouds.

55:16.637 --> 55:19.537
Nature's power will deliver good harvests.

55:19.561 --> 55:21.561
And bless the nation and its people.

55:22.585 --> 55:24.585
Well said!

55:25.509 --> 55:28.509
These are just trifles.

55:28.533 --> 55:31.533
An Imperial Advisor should be much
more skilled.

55:34.557 --> 55:39.557
Now a heavenly relic,
the North Sea Dragon Ball.

55:39.581 --> 55:42.581
It blesses His Majesty and the people.

55:42.605 --> 55:46.505
It offers a glimpse of heaven itself.

55:46.529 --> 55:49.529
- May it please His Majesty.
- Dragon Ball?

55:49.553 --> 55:52.553
It looks very much like the
luminescent pearl...

55:52.577 --> 55:55.577
... which An Nan gave me six years ago.

55:55.601 --> 55:57.601
Really?

55:57.625 --> 55:59.625
I don't think so...

55:59.649 --> 56:02.549
Huo Geng... Bring the relic.

56:02.573 --> 56:04.573
Your Majesty.

56:18.597 --> 56:20.597
What's happening, Huan Tian?

56:20.621 --> 56:22.621
Something's going wrong.

56:23.545 --> 56:25.545
No, this is not part of the plan.

56:25.569 --> 56:27.569
Someone is interfering.

56:27.593 --> 56:29.593
Someone? Who?

56:41.517 --> 56:43.517
The dragon! It's coming to life!

57:14.541 --> 57:16.541
Where did it come from?

57:16.565 --> 57:19.565
- Explain to the Empress!
- I don't know what's happening.

57:19.589 --> 57:21.589
I cannot explain it to her!

57:21.613 --> 57:23.613
Then we should get out of here!

57:23.637 --> 57:25.637
How can we leave now?

57:33.561 --> 57:35.561
Protect their Majesties!

57:39.585 --> 57:41.585
It's a good omen!

57:41.609 --> 57:43.609
The golden dragon reborn!
It's a dynastic omen!

57:43.633 --> 57:45.633
Ha ha ha...

58:06.557 --> 58:08.557
Huan Tian, ​​what is it doing?

58:09.581 --> 58:11.581
An illusion, it's an illusion.

58:20.505 --> 58:22.505
Protect their Majesties!

58:25.529 --> 58:25.979
Madam...

58:25.982 --> 58:27.897
- There's danger, Your Majesty!
- Go away!

58:36.553 --> 58:38.553
The Dragon Ball!

59:14.577 --> 59:18.577
Huan Tian has gone. Huo Geng! Protect
their Majesties and get them away!

59:18.601 --> 59:20.601
- I'll get him back.
- Yes!

59:20.625 --> 59:22.525
Your Majesty...

59:22.563 --> 59:24.563
Seal the exits!

59:25.588 --> 59:27.588
- No one may leave!
- Yes, sir!

59:29.513 --> 59:31.513
Stop him!

59:31.538 --> 59:34.538
We need more men! Quick!

59:39.563 --> 59:41.563
You are all Golden Guards. Stop!

59:41.588 --> 59:43.588
Stop!

59:58.513 --> 01:00:00.513
Catch him!

01:00:00.538 --> 01:00:02.538
He's a murderer.

01:00:02.563 --> 01:00:04.563
Drop your weapons!

01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:07.588
It wasn't me, he's getting away!

01:00:07.613 --> 01:00:09.613
Follow him! Quick!

01:00:10.538 --> 01:00:12.538
Drop your weapons!

01:00:17.563 --> 01:00:20.563
What fools you are. You in particular.

01:00:21.588 --> 01:00:23.588
Take me then!

01:00:23.613 --> 01:00:25.613
Whose idea was it to bring in
those magicians?

01:00:25.638 --> 01:00:27.639
It was Yuchi Zhenjin's suggestion.
You can ask him.

01:00:27.663 --> 01:00:29.663
Where is he?

01:00:29.688 --> 01:00:31.688
Your Majesty, Yuchi is under arrest.

01:00:31.713 --> 01:00:33.513
He killed members of the Golden Guard.

01:00:33.538 --> 01:00:35.538
Now he's in the prison.

01:00:35.563 --> 01:00:37.563
What?

01:00:37.588 --> 01:00:40.588
Put the city on alert.
Summon Dee Renjie for duty!

01:00:40.613 --> 01:00:42.613
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:00:45.538 --> 01:00:47.538
It's a message from the Golden Guard.

01:00:47.563 --> 01:00:48.963
The golden dragon came to life in
the palace! It flew away into the sky.

01:00:48.964 --> 01:00:51.564
Two magicians died, one is missing.

01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:53.589
And Yuchi must have gone mad.

01:00:53.614 --> 01:00:55.614
He killed a few of his own men.
They've locked him up.

01:00:55.639 --> 01:00:57.639
So they've finally started to take action.

01:00:57.664 --> 01:00:59.564
Who? Who do you mean?

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:02.589
Take this bamboo token.
Find Master Yuan Ce at Sanzang Temple.

01:01:02.614 --> 01:01:04.614
Sanzang Temple...

01:01:04.639 --> 01:01:06.639
When Master Sanzang was in India...

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:08.664
He was trying to counter its malign power.

01:01:08.689 --> 01:01:10.689
Now Master Sanzang has passed on.

01:01:10.714 --> 01:01:13.594
The only way to defeat them...
is with the help of his disciple Yuan Ce.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:17.539
Show him this symbol.

01:01:17.564 --> 01:01:18.964
And ask him to help fight their sorcery.

01:01:18.965 --> 01:01:20.965
Is all this connected with the
"Zhanbojia" people?

01:01:20.966 --> 01:01:23.666
They've been planning this for many years.
They used the Mystic Clan as their agents..

01:01:23.667 --> 01:01:25.668
Just to keep watch on us.
Their sorcery is very powerful.

01:01:25.692 --> 01:01:27.692
We need to find a way to distract them.

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.517
Call all the Bureau's men for duty.

01:01:29.542 --> 01:01:31.542
We'll divide into three teams to lure them.

01:01:31.567 --> 01:01:33.567
Lure them?

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.592
The first team... Tell Zhou Jin to lead it.

01:01:38.617 --> 01:01:40.618
They must go to Bingzhou,
pretending to look for me.

01:01:40.642 --> 01:01:42.642
That will draw their attention
stay away from...

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:44.667
the Bureau of Investigations.

01:01:50.592 --> 01:01:52.592
It's them again! What are they up to?

01:01:52.617 --> 01:01:54.517
Tell them...

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:56.543
... to split up and leave false trail.
That will shake off the Mystic Clan.

01:01:56.567 --> 01:01:58.567
Then they return here to wait
for my orders.

01:02:24.592 --> 01:02:27.592
The second team... Take the fastest horses.

01:02:27.617 --> 01:02:29.617
At East Market, change clothes and horses.

01:02:29.642 --> 01:02:31.842
Then ride to Sanzang Temple
to find Master Yuan Ce.

01:02:33.567 --> 01:02:35.567
Boss, give me a new horse, please.

01:02:35.592 --> 01:02:37.593
The third team... I will disguise
myself as Ding Xun's guard.

01:02:37.617 --> 01:02:39.617
And I'll follow Huo gang
of the Golden Guard...

01:02:39.642 --> 01:02:41.642
into the Palace to investigate there.

01:03:00.567 --> 01:03:02.567
Very modest skills...

01:03:02.592 --> 01:03:05.592
Who are you people?
I'm Water Moon, from Fuyin Clan.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.517
The Empress's flunky!

01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:11.542
We thought you were real killers.

01:03:11.567 --> 01:03:15.567
Now we know we overestimated you.

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.592
So now your time is up.

01:03:18.617 --> 01:03:20.617
Time is up?

01:03:22.542 --> 01:03:24.542
You're talking nonsense!

01:04:23.567 --> 01:04:25.567
You're not the Empress.

01:04:25.592 --> 01:04:27.592
You're a fake! Who are you?

01:04:27.617 --> 01:04:29.617
Speak!

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.542
Your name is Water Moon?

01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:44.567
You ought to know that
your name also means...

01:04:44.592 --> 01:04:46.592
... Illusion.

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.517
They'll find me here.

01:07:03.542 --> 01:07:05.542
It's too dangerous here!

01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:08.567
Still here? I said, it's no good!

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:10.592
You're so stupid. Such an idiot.

01:07:10.617 --> 01:07:12.617
- Idiot.
- Tiele dialect?

01:07:12.642 --> 01:07:15.542
You're from Tiele?

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.567
They're here, don't move.

01:07:27.592 --> 01:07:29.592
Shut up.

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:44.517
Any more?

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.542
Can't find her.

01:07:56.567 --> 01:07:58.567
"WATER MOON"

01:07:58.592 --> 01:08:00.592
Report!
Guards from the Bureau just left the city.

01:08:00.617 --> 01:08:02.617
Maybe going for reinforcements.

01:08:05.542 --> 01:08:07.542
Absurd!

01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:14.567
Our loyal service earned us the name
Wind Warriors.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:18.591
We help defeat the late Emperor's enemies.

01:08:19.517 --> 01:08:22.517
This dynasty would not exist
without our help.

01:08:23.542 --> 01:08:25.542
But once he was enthroned......

01:08:27.567 --> 01:08:29.567
... the emperor turned against us.

01:08:30.591 --> 01:08:33.591
Even tried to wipe us out!

01:08:35.517 --> 01:08:38.517
Now his descendants live in comfort.

01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:39.390
"EMPRESS" "EMPEROR"

01:08:39.567 --> 01:08:41.559
And the dynasty prospers.

01:08:41.591 --> 01:08:44.591
Our colleagues are convening
in the capital.

01:08:44.617 --> 01:08:46.617
We will bring down this dynasty!

01:08:46.642 --> 01:08:51.542
The dynasty must fall!

01:09:17.567 --> 01:09:19.567
Your dagger is here.

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.591
You're not badly hurt.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.617
But you've been poisoned.

01:09:24.642 --> 01:09:26.642
I've drawn the venom from your wounds.

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:28.667
Where am I?

01:09:28.692 --> 01:09:30.692
An inn near Ranfang.

01:09:30.716 --> 01:09:32.716
Sirs, please follow me.

01:09:32.742 --> 01:09:34.742
Two guests for Tianzi rooms!

01:09:38.567 --> 01:09:40.567
How did you draw out the poison?

01:09:41.591 --> 01:09:43.591
With my mouth. I cleaned out the wounds.

01:09:43.617 --> 01:09:45.617
Don't worry.

01:09:53.542 --> 01:09:55.542
Don't move!

01:09:59.567 --> 01:10:01.567
Traces of poison are still in your body.

01:10:01.592 --> 01:10:03.592
That's why you feel weak.

01:10:05.517 --> 01:10:07.517
If the poison had reached your heart...

01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:09.542
...you'd be goner.

01:10:10.567 --> 01:10:12.567
It affected me.

01:10:12.592 --> 01:10:14.592
That's why I'm also drinking this.

01:10:14.617 --> 01:10:17.517
I have urgent things to do, I must go.

01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:19.662
Here are five more doses,
take them as you need.

01:10:26.567 --> 01:10:28.567
I told you not to move.

01:10:31.592 --> 01:10:33.592
Come on... drink this.

01:10:33.617 --> 01:10:35.617
Don't touch me!

01:10:35.642 --> 01:10:38.542
Don't move, you're still weak.

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:40.567
Drink this.

01:10:40.592 --> 01:10:42.592
You first!

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.517
It's disgusting!

01:10:58.542 --> 01:11:01.542
Save your strength! You could still die.

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.567
While you still can...

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.592
- Drink it!
- What is it to you if I live or die?

01:11:05.617 --> 01:11:08.517
If you wanna die, just die!

01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:10.542
Yoyr stubbornness kill you!

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:13.567
But you shouldn't die so far from home.

01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:15.592
I don't wanna bury you here.

01:11:16.517 --> 01:11:18.517
Not my problem anuway.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:20.542
However, we from Tiele all believe...

01:11:22.567 --> 01:11:24.567
...that no matter how far you roam...

01:11:24.592 --> 01:11:26.592
...in the final days of your life...

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.517
...you should always go back
to your homeland.

01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:32.542
And die there.

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:39.592
Tiele is too far away.

01:11:40.517 --> 01:11:42.517
I can't get back there.

01:11:45.542 --> 01:11:47.542
And you?

01:11:47.567 --> 01:11:49.567
Why don't you go back there?

01:11:54.592 --> 01:11:57.592
I have duties to the court.
I can't just go where I want.

01:11:57.617 --> 01:12:00.517
I'm not free, like you are.

01:12:00.542 --> 01:12:02.542
I can't choose where to go.

01:12:10.567 --> 01:12:12.567
You must have been through a lot...

01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:14.592
on your travels in the <i>jianghu.</i>

01:12:15.517 --> 01:12:17.637
Is it really too much for you?
The bitterness of this medicine?

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:27.542
I have to go. Take care of yourself.

01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:36.567
Will you come back for me?

01:12:41.592 --> 01:12:43.592
For sure.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:19.517
Why do you wear that strange make-up?

01:13:19.542 --> 01:13:22.542
I don't want anyone to see me as I am.

01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:42.567
I've never touched an assassin's
face before.

01:13:43.592 --> 01:13:46.592
And I've never been friendly
with an officer.

01:13:48.517 --> 01:13:50.517
When I went to the capital...

01:13:50.542 --> 01:13:53.542
I felt a deep bitter pain.
Probably no less bitter...

01:13:53.567 --> 01:13:55.567
... than this medicine.

01:13:55.592 --> 01:13:57.592
So try to bear it.

01:13:57.617 --> 01:13:59.617
Maybe it's not as bitter as you think.

01:13:59.642 --> 01:14:01.642
Trust me... friend.

01:14:23.567 --> 01:14:25.567
Stand to attention!

01:14:25.592 --> 01:14:28.593
I'm Huo Geng of the Golden Guard. And he is
from the Bureau of Investigations.

01:14:28.617 --> 01:14:30.617
We are here to look into the incident.

01:14:30.642 --> 01:14:32.642
Enter!

01:14:38.567 --> 01:14:40.567
This is where it happened.

01:14:40.592 --> 01:14:43.592
The golden dragon came to live...
in front of the Emperor and Empress.

01:14:43.617 --> 01:14:47.517
It killed some people and then flew away.

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.542
That must have been something to see.

01:14:51.567 --> 01:14:53.567
Did you witness it yourself?

01:14:53.592 --> 01:14:56.592
- Yes, I was here.
- I envy you!

01:14:57.517 --> 01:14:59.517
Officer Ding, are you really on this case?

01:14:59.542 --> 01:15:01.542
Indeed.

01:15:01.567 --> 01:15:03.567
My assistant is working on it.

01:15:06.592 --> 01:15:08.592
- Did the dragon hve big eyes?
- What are you asking?

01:15:08.617 --> 01:15:11.517
So the Bureau sends just one man
for this tough case?

01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:13.542
It seems inadequate.

01:15:13.567 --> 01:15:15.567
If Master Dee himself can't come...

01:15:15.592 --> 01:15:17.592
at least he should send Sha Tuo.

01:15:17.617 --> 01:15:19.617
The world of <i>jianghu</i> is full sorcery clans.

01:15:19.642 --> 01:15:21.642
Ultimately, they're just tricks.

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:23.667
What is it? You've found something?

01:15:23.692 --> 01:15:25.592
Nonsense!

01:15:25.617 --> 01:15:27.617
How could that be?
More than a hundred people saw it.

01:15:27.642 --> 01:15:29.642
Including the Emperor and Empress.

01:15:29.667 --> 01:15:32.567
Look! That's where the dragon flew away.

01:15:32.592 --> 01:15:34.592
See the hole it left in the ceiling?

01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:36.617
That was just a trick?

01:15:36.642 --> 01:15:38.542
Hmm!

01:15:39.567 --> 01:15:42.567
You saw what your mind told you to see.

01:15:42.592 --> 01:15:45.592
Breaking the ceiling is an easy
<i>jianghu</i> trick.

01:15:45.617 --> 01:15:48.517
Anyhow... Don't believe all you see.

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:52.542
Anyhow... The dragon's head was
sliced off with a sharp blade.

01:15:52.567 --> 01:15:54.567
I estimate about five feet long.

01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:57.592
The same as the throne.

01:15:57.617 --> 01:15:59.617
Let's take a look.
There were guards everywhere.

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:01.643
Easier to hide it
here than to bring it in.

01:16:01.667 --> 01:16:03.667
- Stop!
- Do you all agree?

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.692
How dare you? That's the imperial throne.

01:16:05.717 --> 01:16:07.517
No one may approach it.

01:16:07.542 --> 01:16:09.542
You didn't check it.
That's why you were deceived.

01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:11.567
Stop!

01:16:11.592 --> 01:16:13.592
My assistant is better at this than me.

01:16:13.617 --> 01:16:16.517
Let him get on with it
if you want the truth.

01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:20.582
This is standard operating
procedure in the Bureau?

01:16:22.567 --> 01:16:24.567
You bet!

01:16:26.592 --> 01:16:28.592
Look! The truth!

01:16:29.517 --> 01:16:31.517
The dragon's head!

01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:36.542
This is the dragon you all saw?

01:16:36.567 --> 01:16:38.567
The one that flew away?

01:16:38.592 --> 01:16:40.592
Fine! Now, General Huo...

01:16:40.617 --> 01:16:43.517
Can you arrange for us to meet Lord Yuchi?

01:16:45.542 --> 01:16:47.542
You want to meet Lord Yuchi?

01:16:47.567 --> 01:16:49.567
He's...

01:16:49.592 --> 01:16:51.592
He's been arrested for criminal negligence.

01:16:51.617 --> 01:16:54.517
I have no authority...

01:16:54.542 --> 01:16:56.542
to let you visit him.

01:16:58.567 --> 01:17:02.567
The one with the authority... would be
Lord Dee with his Dragon-Taming Mace.

01:17:02.592 --> 01:17:04.715
That would make it possible.
So please go back.

01:17:04.719 --> 01:17:05.666
Here I am.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.542
Lead us there, General.

01:17:23.567 --> 01:17:25.567
General Huo!

01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:29.592
Fool! You're all fools!

01:17:29.617 --> 01:17:31.617
Leave me be. How dare you disturb me?

01:17:31.642 --> 01:17:33.642
You bring shame on the Golden Guard.
All of you!

01:17:33.667 --> 01:17:35.667
You're such a bunch of idiots!

01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:37.692
I would never trouble you, sir.

01:17:37.717 --> 01:17:39.517
I am just escorting Dee Renjie.

01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:41.542
Master Dee, this way.

01:17:42.567 --> 01:17:44.567
Dee!

01:17:46.592 --> 01:17:48.592
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:17:48.617 --> 01:17:51.517
Yuchi...
I didn't expect to see you so happy.

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:54.542
See, now I really am an honest man
free of intrigues!

01:17:56.567 --> 01:17:59.567
And Huan Tian is the criminal-in-chief!

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:01.592
Let's get on his trail.

01:18:01.617 --> 01:18:03.618
You think Huan Tian could have
set up such a show?

01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.542
And that he killed off two
of his accomplices?

01:18:06.567 --> 01:18:09.567
And why is he hiding?
Why would he bring trouble on himself?

01:18:09.592 --> 01:18:11.592
What?

01:18:12.517 --> 01:18:15.517
Hiding? Huan Tian is in hiding?

01:18:21.542 --> 01:18:23.542
Huan Tian is in hiding?

01:18:23.567 --> 01:18:25.567
We've scoured the city,
no one can find him.

01:18:27.592 --> 01:18:29.592
Tell me about the moment they arrested you.

01:18:29.617 --> 01:18:31.617
Master Dee...

01:18:31.642 --> 01:18:33.643
We're on alert,
we can't move without permission.

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:35.667
The previous incident in this case
took place here.

01:18:35.692 --> 01:18:37.692
The key to the truth is here.

01:18:37.717 --> 01:18:39.517
Powerful sorcery was deployed.

01:18:39.542 --> 01:18:42.542
Only one clan was capable of doing it.

01:18:42.567 --> 01:18:44.567
Have you heard of the Wind Warriors?

01:18:44.592 --> 01:18:46.592
They originated in India.

01:18:46.617 --> 01:18:48.617
Master Sanzang noted them
when he was in India.

01:18:48.642 --> 01:18:52.542
By his account...
They had thousands of followers.

01:18:52.567 --> 01:18:54.567
And took them to the border of heaven.

01:18:54.592 --> 01:18:57.592
Transcendent experiences...

01:18:57.617 --> 01:19:00.517
But actually achieved through sorcery.

01:19:02.542 --> 01:19:04.542
Their spells can play with the mind.

01:19:04.567 --> 01:19:06.567
They can manipulate behavior.

01:19:06.592 --> 01:19:08.592
Manipulate behavior?

01:19:08.617 --> 01:19:10.617
In that case, the dragon we saw flying...

01:19:10.642 --> 01:19:13.542
Once they'd been hypnotized...
Everything they saw was an illusion.

01:19:18.567 --> 01:19:20.567
Where does this lead?

01:19:20.592 --> 01:19:23.592
- To the attendants' quarters.
- Come.

01:19:24.517 --> 01:19:26.517
The sorcery will lose its power.

01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:28.542
The one who faked the dragon
and kill the magicians...

01:19:28.567 --> 01:19:30.568
also hid Huan Tian.
And all three things had to be done...

01:19:30.592 --> 01:19:32.592
while the spell was still effective.

01:19:34.517 --> 01:19:36.154
It happened in the West Corridor,
where there's

01:19:36.179 --> 01:19:37.518
a shortcut to the attendants' quarters.

01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:40.542
They manage the imperial carriages.

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:42.567
Where are the carriages parked?

01:19:42.592 --> 01:19:43.623
"ATTENDANT QUARTER"
- General Huo,

01:19:43.627 --> 01:19:45.517
what brings you here so late?

01:19:45.542 --> 01:19:48.542
We're investigating the incident.

01:19:48.567 --> 01:19:50.567
Dee...

01:19:50.592 --> 01:19:52.592
What makes you think they came this way?

01:19:53.517 --> 01:19:55.517
That's His Majesty's carriage.

01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:57.542
Don't touch it.

01:19:57.567 --> 01:19:59.567
Let's see what's inside it.

01:20:07.592 --> 01:20:09.592
Come on!

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:14.517
Alright...

01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:16.842
- Step aside.
- Sir!

01:20:16.843 --> 01:20:18.544
If the culprit wanted to escape
from the palace...

01:20:18.568 --> 01:20:20.568
The South Corridor is the quickest way.

01:20:20.593 --> 01:20:23.593
My guess is... They needed you
to cover their escape.

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:25.618
So they "borrowed" your face and weapon.

01:20:25.643 --> 01:20:27.643
Impersonating you made the
getaway possible.

01:20:27.668 --> 01:20:30.568
The carriage...
makes a perfect hiding place.

01:20:30.593 --> 01:20:33.593
A hiding place?

01:20:35.518 --> 01:20:37.518
Theie Majesties often go outside
the palace.

01:20:37.543 --> 01:20:40.543
Maybe they wanted to get
something out of the palace.

01:20:43.568 --> 01:20:45.568
Her Majesty often leaves the palace.

01:20:55.593 --> 01:20:57.594
There's something in the carriage floor!
See what it is!

01:20:57.618 --> 01:20:59.618
Quick.

01:21:00.543 --> 01:21:02.543
- Ding Xun...
- Wait a moment.

01:21:07.568 --> 01:21:09.568
Watch for poison!

01:21:30.593 --> 01:21:32.593
- Huan Tian!
- The Imperial Advisor!

01:21:32.618 --> 01:21:34.618
Advisor my foot!

01:21:34.643 --> 01:21:36.643
Soldier, think clearly!

01:21:40.568 --> 01:21:42.568
What happened to...

01:21:42.593 --> 01:21:44.593
the two magicians who died?

01:21:45.518 --> 01:21:48.518
Smoke Volant's bones were broken.
And Ghost Night was burned alive.

01:21:48.543 --> 01:21:50.543
Two horrible deaths.

01:21:51.568 --> 01:21:54.568
We'll need to confirm that it was
they who died.

01:21:55.593 --> 01:21:58.593
Huan Tian was dead when his
body was hidden here.

01:22:00.518 --> 01:22:02.518
If they'd finished with him...

01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:04.543
why did they still need to hide him?

01:22:08.568 --> 01:22:10.568
I'm getting the impression that
the culprits...

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:12.593
... were right in your midst.

01:22:12.618 --> 01:22:14.618
Suggesting that Huan Tian was to blame...

01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:16.643
...was a way of misleading us.

01:22:16.668 --> 01:22:18.668
That means His Majesty...

01:22:18.693 --> 01:22:20.693
...is still in danger!

01:22:21.518 --> 01:22:23.518
Why would they need to mislead us?

01:22:34.543 --> 01:22:36.543
Come on...

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:46.569
The culprit was right next to the Emperor.

01:22:46.593 --> 01:22:49.593
But didn't assassinate him. So the Emperor
was not the immediate target.

01:22:51.518 --> 01:22:53.518
It's too dangerous here in this palace!

01:22:53.543 --> 01:22:57.543
We must move His Majesty to safety.

01:22:59.568 --> 01:23:01.568
And the Empress?

01:23:02.593 --> 01:23:05.593
Dee, are you suggesting...

01:23:05.618 --> 01:23:08.098
...there's a connection between
her and the culprit?

01:23:11.543 --> 01:23:13.543
Are you alright?

01:23:14.568 --> 01:23:16.568
Dee, what's wrong with you?

01:23:24.593 --> 01:23:26.593
Faceless Lord!

01:23:26.618 --> 01:23:28.618
Are you there? I followed your advice.

01:23:28.643 --> 01:23:30.643
But the result was not as you said.

01:23:30.668 --> 01:23:31.915
What's your excuse for
getting it all wrong?

01:23:31.919 --> 01:23:35.568
Be quiet, you ignorant shrew!

01:23:35.593 --> 01:23:38.593
The golden dragon moved. A good omen.

01:23:38.618 --> 01:23:41.518
You will eventually lead the nation.

01:23:41.543 --> 01:23:43.543
Enough of your complaints!

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:53.568
My prediction will come true.

01:23:53.593 --> 01:23:56.593
Now it's your turn to keep a promise.

01:23:56.618 --> 01:23:59.518
Rehabilitate my name and family!

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.543
Madam!

01:24:10.568 --> 01:24:12.568
Madam!

01:24:13.593 --> 01:24:15.593
Madam!

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.518
Huang Shang...

01:24:19.543 --> 01:24:20.543
It's you

01:24:20.568 --> 01:24:22.568
Where is the Faceless Lord?

01:24:22.593 --> 01:24:24.593
Where are you, Faceless Lord?

01:24:25.518 --> 01:24:28.518
Madam! No one is there.

01:24:28.543 --> 01:24:31.543
You are talking to yourself.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.568
You lie! He was right in front of me.

01:24:35.593 --> 01:24:38.593
Faceless Lord! He was right here!

01:24:38.618 --> 01:24:40.618
I saw him just now!

01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:42.643
- Madam...
- Faceless Lord!

01:24:42.668 --> 01:24:44.669
- The man locked in this dungeon...
- The Faceless Lord!

01:24:44.693 --> 01:24:46.693
...he died two years ago.

01:24:46.718 --> 01:24:49.518
The dungeon has been empty ever since.

01:24:50.543 --> 01:24:52.543
Faceless Lord, show yourself!

01:24:52.568 --> 01:24:54.568
Madam... Don't worry.

01:24:54.593 --> 01:24:56.593
I give you my promise.

01:24:56.618 --> 01:24:58.618
You will be protected.

01:24:58.643 --> 01:25:00.643
I will keep you safe from any danger.

01:25:05.568 --> 01:25:07.568
Why is Dee Renjie with you?

01:25:07.593 --> 01:25:11.593
You...

01:25:13.518 --> 01:25:15.518
Madam! Madam!

01:25:16.543 --> 01:25:18.543
Back to the palace, now!

01:25:18.568 --> 01:25:20.568
I suggest not, sir.

01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:22.593
The palace is not safe for you.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:24.618
Her Majesty's needs to be
elsewhere for a time.

01:25:24.643 --> 01:25:26.643
We will prepare somewhere safer.

01:25:27.568 --> 01:25:29.568
SANZANG TEMPLE

01:25:46.593 --> 01:25:47.623
I'm Sha Tuo, from the
Bureau of Investigations.

01:25:47.627 --> 01:25:49.593
I'm here to see Master Yuan Ce.

01:25:49.618 --> 01:25:50.518
It is good.

01:25:50.543 --> 01:25:52.543
But the Master is in seclusion,
not receiving guests.

01:25:52.568 --> 01:25:54.568
I bring Master Sanzang's token.

01:26:02.593 --> 01:26:04.593
This area is a shrine.

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:06.618
Utter no words beyond this point.

01:26:06.642 --> 01:26:08.642
How will I explain why I'm here?

01:26:08.666 --> 01:26:10.666
Misunderstandings will make things worse!

01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:58.590
All approaches come down to knowledge.

01:27:58.614 --> 01:28:00.614
Knowledge knows no boundary.

01:28:02.538 --> 01:28:04.538
I can tell what in your mind
brings you here.

01:28:04.562 --> 01:28:07.562
Sorcerous possession has
occurred in the nation.

01:28:07.586 --> 01:28:10.586
Dee Renjie sent you here.

01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:14.510
To see if I have the power to help you.

01:28:28.534 --> 01:28:31.534
Your Majesty, you handed the
Dragon-Taming Mace to Dee.

01:28:31.558 --> 01:28:33.558
But what if he turned against us?

01:28:33.582 --> 01:28:36.582
Our nation will be helpness against him.

01:28:36.606 --> 01:28:38.606
Leng Yu's studio is laced with poisons.

01:28:38.630 --> 01:28:40.630
It's a trap!

01:28:42.554 --> 01:28:46.554
The Bureau must have a leader.
For public safety,

01:28:46.578 --> 01:28:50.578
I take command of the Bureau.

01:28:50.602 --> 01:28:53.502
Master Sanzang used to chant that
ancient Indian sutra.

01:28:53.526 --> 01:28:56.526
He was trying to counter its malign power.

01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:58.550
Now Master Sanzang has passed on.

01:28:58.574 --> 01:28:59.974
So the only way we can defeat
the evil sorcery...

01:28:59.975 --> 01:29:01.975
is with the help of his disciple, Yuan Ce.

01:29:01.999 --> 01:29:03.599
Find Master Yuan Ce at Sanzang Temple.

01:29:03.623 --> 01:29:05.523
Ask him to help us.

01:29:05.547 --> 01:29:07.547
Yet again, the lust for power
has malign consequences.

01:29:08.571 --> 01:29:11.571
Salvation lies in repentance.

01:29:12.595 --> 01:29:14.595
In all these conflicting feelings...

01:29:14.619 --> 01:29:16.619
...I should not interfere.

01:29:17.543 --> 01:29:19.543
You should depart.

01:29:50.567 --> 01:29:52.567
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS

01:30:06.591 --> 01:30:08.591
- Master Dee, you're back.
- Come over here.

01:30:09.515 --> 01:30:10.265
- Master Dee...
- Master Dee...

01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:12.515
If you glimpse the Emperor,
no need to greet him.

01:30:12.539 --> 01:30:15.539
Follow my orders and receive them here.

01:30:15.563 --> 01:30:17.563
- We need absolute secrecy.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:21.587 --> 01:30:24.587
Your... Come this way.

01:30:31.511 --> 01:30:33.511
Dee!

01:30:35.535 --> 01:30:37.535
Was that ...?

01:30:37.559 --> 01:30:39.559
No hint that Their Majesties are here.

01:30:40.583 --> 01:30:42.583
Over here.

01:30:43.507 --> 01:30:45.507
What did Master Yuan Ce say?

01:30:46.531 --> 01:30:48.531
He's in seclusion... Won't come.

01:30:50.555 --> 01:30:53.555
But there's a letter, from a giant ape.

01:30:53.579 --> 01:30:55.579
Here it is.

01:30:58.503 --> 01:31:00.503
- What is that?
- Sanskrit.

01:31:01.527 --> 01:31:03.527
This is the Daluo Longjie Sutra from India.

01:31:03.551 --> 01:31:05.551
Can this...

01:31:05.575 --> 01:31:07.575
help counter the sorcery?

01:31:12.599 --> 01:31:14.599
You were sick again?

01:31:19.523 --> 01:31:22.523
Dee, how powerful are the Wind Warriors?

01:31:22.547 --> 01:31:25.547
They fought whole armies
to help found the dynasty.

01:31:25.571 --> 01:31:27.571
Our bureau can't compare with them.

01:31:27.595 --> 01:31:30.595
Without Yuan Ce's help...

01:31:30.619 --> 01:31:32.619
We may face defeat.

01:31:34.543 --> 01:31:37.543
Then we must find a way to enlist him.

01:31:41.567 --> 01:31:44.047
Hell is full of sufferers,
so enlightenment must wait.

01:31:44.591 --> 01:31:47.591
Hell is full of sufferers,
so enlightenment must wait.

01:31:50.515 --> 01:31:52.515
Hell is full of sufferers...

01:31:53.539 --> 01:31:55.539
So enlightenment must wait.

01:31:57.563 --> 01:31:59.563
Master Yuan Ce!

01:32:00.587 --> 01:32:03.067
Hell is full of sufferers,
so enlightenment must wait.

01:32:03.511 --> 01:32:05.511
If I don't enter hell, who will?

01:32:09.535 --> 01:32:12.535
Report! The Empress has
regained her sanity.

01:32:12.559 --> 01:32:14.559
Please give us your command.

01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:17.583
Our clansmen are gathering...

01:32:17.607 --> 01:32:19.607
to enact your orders!

01:32:20.531 --> 01:32:24.531
My Lord... The Emperor and
Empress have left the palace.

01:32:24.555 --> 01:32:26.555
All seems normal in the palace.

01:32:26.579 --> 01:32:29.579
But the Bureau of Investigations
is heavily guarded.

01:32:31.503 --> 01:32:33.503
Dee Renjie! What a buffon!

01:32:34.527 --> 01:32:37.527
It's too obvious.

01:32:42.551 --> 01:32:44.551
Well said!

01:32:45.575 --> 01:32:47.575
The riskiest place...

01:32:47.599 --> 01:32:50.599
is the safest place to hide!

01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:55.523
Dee Renjie is very devious.

01:32:56.547 --> 01:33:01.547
He seeks to protect the Emperor.

01:33:01.571 --> 01:33:06.571
So wherever Dee goes...

01:33:06.595 --> 01:33:10.595
...we can be sure to find the Emperor.

01:33:10.619 --> 01:33:14.519
Just check that he's in
the Bureau tonight.

01:33:18.543 --> 01:33:21.543
If he is, sneak inside...

01:33:21.567 --> 01:33:24.567
And kill the Emperor as soon as
you find him!

01:33:24.591 --> 01:33:26.591
My Lord...

01:33:26.615 --> 01:33:28.615
Our final victory is at hand.

01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:30.639
Our thousands of disciples...

01:33:30.663 --> 01:33:32.663
... will finally see the light!

01:33:32.687 --> 01:33:34.687
My Lord...

01:33:39.511 --> 01:33:41.511
When this weapon locks on to
someone's head...

01:33:41.535 --> 01:33:45.535
...it become immoveable.

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.559
Dee, stay calm.

01:33:53.583 --> 01:33:56.583
You don't look well, you need more rest.

01:34:03.507 --> 01:34:05.507
Master Sanzang said...

01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:08.531
Hell is full of sufferers,
so enlightenment must wait.

01:34:09.555 --> 01:34:13.555
That means... Fighting for
justice in this demonic world...

01:34:13.579 --> 01:34:15.579
is more important than
attaining enlightenment.

01:34:19.503 --> 01:34:21.503
Master Yuan Ce has great talents.

01:34:22.527 --> 01:34:24.527
But seclusion is not the way.

01:34:24.551 --> 01:34:26.551
It's been ten years.

01:34:26.575 --> 01:34:28.575
The path to Buddhahood...

01:34:28.599 --> 01:34:33.599
is actually to aid the suffering people.

01:34:33.623 --> 01:34:37.523
The Wind Warriors threaten us
with disaster.

01:34:38.547 --> 01:34:40.547
Hell is at hand.

01:34:42.571 --> 01:34:44.571
This is the moment for him to intervene.

01:34:46.595 --> 01:34:48.595
I have to find him myself.

01:34:48.619 --> 01:34:50.619
You need more rest.

01:34:50.643 --> 01:34:52.643
- But who else can go?
- In that case...

01:34:52.667 --> 01:34:55.567
I can recommend to you...

01:34:55.591 --> 01:34:57.591
There's one...

01:34:57.615 --> 01:35:00.515
One person. Someone who's very quick.

01:35:00.539 --> 01:35:02.539
And skilled at creating illusions.

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:05.563
Someone who'd get the job done fast.

01:35:09.587 --> 01:35:11.587
This would be the woman assassin
you've just saved?

01:35:15.511 --> 01:35:17.511
Umm.

01:35:18.535 --> 01:35:20.535
And she's going to help the Bureau?

01:35:22.559 --> 01:35:25.559
Water Moon, may I come in?

01:35:25.583 --> 01:35:27.583
No, I'm getting changed.

01:35:27.607 --> 01:35:29.607
It's an urgent matter. Let me come in.

01:35:29.631 --> 01:35:31.631
I'll keep my eyes closed.

01:35:33.555 --> 01:35:36.555
Last night something went missing
from the Bureau.

01:35:36.579 --> 01:35:38.579
I assume you took it!

01:35:39.503 --> 01:35:41.503
What? You assume?

01:35:43.527 --> 01:35:45.527
Open your eyes!

01:35:49.551 --> 01:35:52.551
- You're fully dressed!
- Who said I wasn't?

01:35:53.575 --> 01:35:55.575
Alright!

01:35:55.599 --> 01:35:57.599
Enter! Search the premises.

01:35:57.623 --> 01:35:59.623
Stop! What are you looking for?

01:36:08.547 --> 01:36:10.547
What went missing?

01:36:10.571 --> 01:36:13.571
You know very well.

01:36:17.595 --> 01:36:19.595
Officer Sha Tuo...

01:36:21.519 --> 01:36:23.519
Take her.

01:36:27.543 --> 01:36:30.543
I'm telling you... I've taken nothing.

01:36:31.567 --> 01:36:33.607
I realize you no longer take me
as your friend.

01:36:35.591 --> 01:36:37.591
But I don't like being in debt to anyone.

01:36:39.515 --> 01:36:41.515
Next time you need me...

01:36:42.539 --> 01:36:44.539
I'll be there for you.

01:36:45.563 --> 01:36:49.563
And I'll always take you as a friend.

01:36:54.587 --> 01:36:56.587
Move!

01:36:59.511 --> 01:37:02.511
This was all my idea.

01:37:02.535 --> 01:37:04.535
No offense intended, please forgive us.

01:37:08.559 --> 01:37:10.559
Now I, Dee Renjie...

01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:14.583
On behalf of the Bureau...
Officially request your assistance, Ma'am.

01:37:45.507 --> 01:37:47.507
Not my face!

01:37:47.531 --> 01:37:49.531
Not my face!

01:38:12.555 --> 01:38:14.555
Please come back to help us.

01:38:15.579 --> 01:38:17.579
This is the sutra sent by Master Yuan Ce.

01:38:17.603 --> 01:38:19.603
The Daluo Longjie Sutra.

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:21.627
Now we will all...

01:38:21.651 --> 01:38:23.651
start to recite it.

01:38:23.675 --> 01:38:26.575
Be on guard! Prepare to fight!

01:38:26.599 --> 01:38:28.599
- Yes, sir!
- Dee...

01:38:28.623 --> 01:38:30.623
You think the sutra really will help?

01:38:34.547 --> 01:38:38.547
Itt will help us to defend ourselves.
To win, though, we'll need to be flexible.

01:38:39.571 --> 01:38:41.571
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS

01:38:49.595 --> 01:38:51.595
I now realize...

01:38:51.619 --> 01:38:54.519
Just how powerful the
Dragon-Taming Mace really is.

01:39:21.543 --> 01:39:23.543
Your nickname is "Huai Ying".

01:39:23.567 --> 01:39:26.567
May I call you Huai Ying?

01:39:34.591 --> 01:39:38.591
It's late and you need to rest.

01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:42.515
But I owe you so much.

01:39:45.539 --> 01:39:48.539
This is not appropriate, Your Majesty.

01:39:48.563 --> 01:39:51.563
Whatever it is, let's discuss it tomorrow.

01:39:52.587 --> 01:39:55.587
Forget protocol.

01:39:56.511 --> 01:39:58.511
Do you share my feelings?

01:39:58.535 --> 01:40:00.535
Impatient?

01:40:04.559 --> 01:40:06.559
Restless?

01:40:08.583 --> 01:40:10.583
I just learned...

01:40:10.607 --> 01:40:12.607
The Faceless Lord was a Wind Warrior.

01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:15.531
He gave himself up to save his people.

01:40:15.555 --> 01:40:17.555
He was detained as a hostage.

01:40:17.579 --> 01:40:20.579
But the Wind Warriors... were nonetheless
slaughtered by the Emperor's army...

01:40:20.603 --> 01:40:22.603
...without mercy.

01:40:22.627 --> 01:40:24.627
They were almost annihilated.

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:26.651
Thirty years went by.

01:40:27.575 --> 01:40:29.575
But their hatred and resentment...

01:40:31.599 --> 01:40:33.599
...found no end.

01:40:35.523 --> 01:40:37.523
Huai Ying...

01:40:38.547 --> 01:40:40.547
You are so intelligent.

01:40:42.571 --> 01:40:46.571
That's why I adore you.

01:40:47.595 --> 01:40:49.595
The night is long.

01:40:51.519 --> 01:40:53.519
I can't sleep.

01:40:54.543 --> 01:40:59.543
So I've come to pour out my love for you.

01:40:59.567 --> 01:41:01.567
In my opinion...

01:41:01.591 --> 01:41:05.591
Your Majesty is here for the
Dragon-Taming Mace, right?

01:41:09.515 --> 01:41:12.515
And it's the real one this time!

01:41:15.539 --> 01:41:18.019
Whether it's real or fake...
You can find out yourself.

01:41:19.563 --> 01:41:22.563
You won't strike me with it, will you?

01:41:24.587 --> 01:41:26.587
What's that?

01:41:26.611 --> 01:41:28.611
The anti-sorcery sutra!

01:41:28.635 --> 01:41:30.635
How dare you impersonate Her Majesty!

01:41:33.559 --> 01:41:36.559
The Iron Snow blade! I believe it was
used to slice off the dragon's head.

01:41:57.583 --> 01:41:59.583
So the sound from the Mace
counters the sorcery!

01:41:59.607 --> 01:42:01.607
Show me who you really are.

01:42:01.631 --> 01:42:03.631
Dee Renjie...

01:42:03.655 --> 01:42:05.655
You saw through my ruse.

01:42:05.679 --> 01:42:07.679
But I saw through your mind.

01:42:07.703 --> 01:42:10.503
You defended the Bureau.

01:42:10.527 --> 01:42:13.527
That means the Emperor is here.

01:42:16.551 --> 01:42:18.551
- Fire!
- Bring water!

01:42:18.575 --> 01:42:20.575
The dynasty must fall!

01:42:24.599 --> 01:42:26.599
Get away!

01:42:27.523 --> 01:42:29.523
Ha ha ha...

01:42:37.547 --> 01:42:39.547
The dynasty must fall!

01:42:41.571 --> 01:42:43.571
The dynasty must fall!

01:42:43.595 --> 01:42:46.595
Can't see it? Where did it go?

01:42:47.519 --> 01:42:48.519
Hurry!

01:42:48.543 --> 01:42:50.543
Master... How can we fight that?

01:42:51.567 --> 01:42:53.567
This is our last stand!

01:42:54.591 --> 01:42:56.591
You think Water Moon has reached
Sanzang Temple yet?

01:42:56.615 --> 01:42:58.615
SANZANG TEMPLLE

01:43:01.439 --> 01:43:02.745
Master Yuan Ce!

01:43:04.263 --> 01:43:05.039
Master Yuan Ce!

01:43:09.187 --> 01:43:10.243
Master Yuan Ce!

01:43:11.611 --> 01:43:13.611
Master Yuan Ce!

01:43:14.535 --> 01:43:16.535
Master Yuan Ce!

01:43:20.259 --> 01:43:22.559
Where are you?

01:43:30.583 --> 01:43:34.583
Damn it... The fog puts us at
a disadvantage.

01:43:35.507 --> 01:43:38.507
Master Dee... I hear you've
suffered a nervous affliction.

01:43:38.531 --> 01:43:42.531
Can it be cured?

01:43:43.555 --> 01:43:46.555
It comes from a demon in my mind.

01:43:46.579 --> 01:43:48.579
The first thing is to kill that demon.

01:43:49.503 --> 01:43:51.503
Is everything ready?

01:43:51.527 --> 01:43:53.527
As you commanded.

01:44:15.551 --> 01:44:17.551
What is that?

01:44:17.575 --> 01:44:19.575
Stay alert up there!

01:44:22.599 --> 01:44:24.599
Everyone on full alert!

01:44:24.623 --> 01:44:25.623
Be prepared.

01:44:25.647 --> 01:44:27.647
Be prepared.

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:39.571
Release the net!

01:44:58.595 --> 01:45:00.595
Chant the sutra.

01:45:00.619 --> 01:45:02.619
<i>(Daluo Longjie Sutra)</i>

01:45:02.643 --> 01:45:04.643
I haven't chanted it yet!

01:45:04.667 --> 01:45:07.567
Who has the sutra with him? Thank you!

01:45:07.591 --> 01:45:15.591
<i>(Daluo Longjie Sutra)</i>

01:45:27.515 --> 01:45:30.515
The sutra is working!

01:45:30.539 --> 01:45:32.539
Who was caught up in that giant hand?

01:45:32.563 --> 01:45:34.563
Shu Huan! He's still there! Quick!

01:45:35.587 --> 01:45:37.587
Shu Huan, are you injured?

01:45:40.511 --> 01:45:42.511
Wake up!

01:45:49.535 --> 01:45:51.535
- Regroup!
- Regroup!

01:45:51.559 --> 01:45:53.559
Rescue the wounded from the yard, quick!

01:45:53.583 --> 01:45:55.583
Protect the front line fighters,
prepare to fight!

01:45:55.607 --> 01:45:57.607
Sir!

01:46:34.531 --> 01:46:36.531
Master, we can't hold the battlements!

01:46:37.555 --> 01:46:39.555
- Distract them!
- Sir!

01:46:41.579 --> 01:46:43.579
Send the signal!

01:46:47.503 --> 01:46:49.503
You leave first! Quick!

01:46:58.527 --> 01:47:00.527
Master...

01:47:19.551 --> 01:47:21.551
Quick! Send the signal!

01:47:29.575 --> 01:47:31.575
Charge!

01:48:14.599 --> 01:48:16.599
Sorcery! Chant the sutra!

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:18.623
Sir!

01:48:24.547 --> 01:48:26.547
Loose!

01:48:49.571 --> 01:48:51.571
The sorcery is tricking them!
This is our last chance.

01:48:51.595 --> 01:48:53.895
Great!

01:48:56.519 --> 01:48:58.519
This is it...

01:48:58.543 --> 01:49:00.543
We have to take the risk.

01:49:01.567 --> 01:49:03.567
You casually hid the Mace here?

01:49:09.591 --> 01:49:11.591
Stop!

01:49:22.515 --> 01:49:24.515
Golden Guard! Stop!

01:49:25.539 --> 01:49:27.539
Stop!

01:49:27.563 --> 01:49:29.563
Everyone, stop! Those are our people!

01:49:29.587 --> 01:49:31.587
We've just beaten their sorcery!

01:49:33.511 --> 01:49:35.511
The back courtyard is ablaze!

01:49:37.535 --> 01:49:39.035
- The Emperor!
- Protect him!

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:39.535
Sir!

01:49:39.559 --> 01:49:41.559
- I'll go.
- Move!

01:49:47.583 --> 01:49:49.583
Yi An! Defend Master Dee!

01:49:49.607 --> 01:49:51.607
Yes!

01:50:27.531 --> 01:50:29.531
You're trapped!

01:50:30.555 --> 01:50:32.555
The Emperor and Empress...

01:50:32.579 --> 01:50:34.579
...were never here.

01:50:36.503 --> 01:50:39.503
Those who arrived here...
... in that imperial carriage...

01:50:39.527 --> 01:50:41.527
... were not the imperial couple.

01:50:41.551 --> 01:50:43.551
We faked it!

01:50:43.575 --> 01:50:45.575
Ha ha ha...

01:50:54.599 --> 01:50:57.599
You tried to trick me?
I have no time for tricks.

01:51:16.523 --> 01:51:18.523
Dee Renjie...

01:51:18.547 --> 01:51:20.547
The game between us...

01:51:20.571 --> 01:51:22.571
... is over.

01:51:22.595 --> 01:51:25.595
Clan leader, the anger of hate has no end.

01:51:25.619 --> 01:51:28.519
A great man knows how to forgive.

01:51:28.543 --> 01:51:31.543
It's forgiveness that defines him as great.

01:51:31.567 --> 01:51:34.567
Why do you used your ancestors' hatred...

01:51:34.591 --> 01:51:36.591
to plunge the new world into chaos?

01:51:36.615 --> 01:51:39.515
We were victims of a power struggle.

01:51:39.539 --> 01:51:41.539
And you will be too!

01:51:42.563 --> 01:51:44.563
You're wrong.

01:51:45.587 --> 01:51:47.587
Our clash today...

01:51:47.611 --> 01:51:50.511
...may not have the outcome you expect.

01:51:52.535 --> 01:51:55.535
Dee, you underestimate my powers.

01:51:56.559 --> 01:51:58.559
You really think your sutra...

01:51:58.583 --> 01:52:00.583
...is stronger than my sorcery?

01:52:07.507 --> 01:52:10.507
- How is he doing that?
- All his sorcery is trickery.

01:52:10.531 --> 01:52:12.531
Remember... Protect the
Dragon-Taming Mace at all costs.

01:52:12.555 --> 01:52:15.555
Dee Renjie, see clearly what is happening.

01:52:15.579 --> 01:52:18.579
Don't torture yourself.
Kill the unworthy Emperor!

01:52:18.603 --> 01:52:20.603
Golden Guard, be ready!

01:52:38.527 --> 01:52:40.527
Spread out!

01:53:09.551 --> 01:53:11.551
Now you're trapped! Do your worst!

01:53:27.575 --> 01:53:29.575
Dee!

01:53:32.599 --> 01:53:34.599
Master Dee!

01:53:35.523 --> 01:53:37.523
Sha Tuo!

01:53:50.547 --> 01:53:52.547
Master Dee!

01:54:13.571 --> 01:54:15.571
From the left!

01:54:17.595 --> 01:54:23.595

01:55:04.519 --> 01:55:06.519
Alright?

01:55:21.543 --> 01:55:23.543
Yuchi!

01:55:24.567 --> 01:55:26.567
Take this!

01:55:41.591 --> 01:55:43.591
The Tang Dynasty must fall!

01:55:56.515 --> 01:55:58.515
Kill him! Out of my way!

01:56:01.539 --> 01:56:03.539
Come here! Looking for trouble?

01:56:08.563 --> 01:56:10.563
I'm back.

01:56:10.587 --> 01:56:12.587
You're not that badly hurt.

01:56:13.511 --> 01:56:15.511
If you'd been any later, I'd be gone!

01:56:30.535 --> 01:56:33.535
- Master Yuan Ce!
- You can't stop this now.

01:59:47.159 --> 01:59:50.159
The hatred is endless.

01:59:51.183 --> 01:59:54.183
Once you release that demon...

01:59:54.207 --> 01:59:56.207
... it is always with you.

01:59:56.231 --> 01:59:58.231
There is no escaping it.

02:00:32.555 --> 02:00:36.555
Too ridiculuous!
You're trying to control my mind?

02:00:36.579 --> 02:00:39.579
This weapon was made to counter
mind-control!

02:00:43.583 --> 02:00:45.921
Master!

02:00:50.507 --> 02:00:52.507
Master!

02:00:52.531 --> 02:00:54.531
It's a weapon from hell.

02:00:54.555 --> 02:00:57.555
Once it's locked in position,
it can't be moved!

02:00:58.579 --> 02:01:00.579
Your soul now is trapped forever.

02:01:01.503 --> 02:01:03.503
Any last word before dying?

02:01:03.527 --> 02:01:05.527
Speak up!

02:01:05.551 --> 02:01:07.551
Ha ha ha...

02:01:09.575 --> 02:01:12.575
Life is infinitely precious.

02:01:12.599 --> 02:01:15.599
Why would we allow hatred
to contaminate it?

02:01:16.523 --> 02:01:19.523
You will regret killing me.

02:01:19.547 --> 02:01:22.547
Fine words!
But they won't stop you from dying!

02:01:41.571 --> 02:01:43.571
An inner demon urges killing.

02:01:43.595 --> 02:01:45.595
Expel it from our heart...

02:01:45.619 --> 02:01:47.619
...and the weapon will fall open.

02:01:47.643 --> 02:01:49.643
An inner demon urges killing.

02:01:49.667 --> 02:01:51.567
Expel it from our heart...

02:01:51.591 --> 02:01:53.591
...and the weapon will fall open.

02:01:54.515 --> 02:01:56.515
An inner demon urges killing.

02:01:56.539 --> 02:01:58.539
Expel it from our heart...

02:01:58.563 --> 02:02:00.563
...and the weapon will fall open.

02:02:27.587 --> 02:02:29.587
The hatred is endless.

02:02:29.611 --> 02:02:31.611
With no space for regret.

02:02:35.535 --> 02:02:37.535
Expel the urge to kill, expel the demon.

02:03:02.559 --> 02:03:04.559
Hell is full of sufferers.

02:03:04.583 --> 02:03:07.583
So enlightenment can wait.
I'm sorry I wasn't here earlier.

02:03:08.507 --> 02:03:11.507
Forgive me for being late.
Please forgive me.

02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:13.531
And please receive my respect.

02:03:36.555 --> 02:03:39.555
Your Majesty,
the Bureau's battle is over.

02:03:39.579 --> 02:03:41.579
Your Majesty can return to the palace.

02:03:45.503 --> 02:03:48.503
Valiant fighters, you have fought hard.

02:03:51.527 --> 02:03:55.527
Empress, we can return home.

02:04:42.576 --> 02:04:46.576
My mind was manipulated through sorcery.

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:51.500
From now on, these sutras...

02:04:51.524 --> 02:04:53.524
...will help to keep my mind clear.

02:05:24.572 --> 02:05:27.572
This statue of Guan Yin...
resembles Your Majesty.

02:05:29.596 --> 02:05:31.596
It was crafted by a palace carpenter.

02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:34.520
The resemblance is coincidental.

02:05:50.544 --> 02:05:52.544
The Faceless Lord's ghost is still here.

02:05:52.568 --> 02:05:54.568
So the case is not yet closed.

02:05:55.592 --> 02:05:58.592
The Empress thinks she is a Bodhisattva.

02:05:58.616 --> 02:06:01.516
Her ambition to rule the nation
is all too clear.

02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:05.540
From now on... The Mace, the Golden Guard,
the Bureau...

02:06:05.564 --> 02:06:07.564
must all be ready.

02:06:07.588 --> 02:06:10.588
Another power struggles is coming!

02:06:27.512 --> 02:06:29.512
Twenty years later...

02:06:29.536 --> 02:06:31.536
A large statue of the goddess Guan Yin
was installed in the city of Luoyang.

02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:33.560
One year after that...

02:06:33.584 --> 02:06:36.013
Empress Wu declared herself sole ruler and

02:06:36.038 --> 02:06:38.608
changed the dynastic name
from "Tang" to "Zhou".

02:07:46.532 --> 02:07:48.532
Master Yuan Ce!

02:07:49.556 --> 02:07:51.556
Master Yuan Ce!

02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:56.580
Master Yuan Ce!

02:07:58.504 --> 02:08:00.504
It's the Wind Warriors.

02:08:01.528 --> 02:08:03.528
Where have you hidden Master Yuan Ce!?

02:08:05.552 --> 02:08:07.552
He isn't hidden.

02:08:07.576 --> 02:08:09.576
He told us to kneel here.

02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:19.500
So you actually are Master Yuan Ce!
