WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:02.771
Thanks for giving me a ride, Yolanda.

00:02.772 --> 00:04.610
I promise, as soon as Sofia gets a job,

00:04.611 --> 00:05.981
I will have my car back.

00:05.982 --> 00:07.182
Oh, that's okay.

00:07.395 --> 00:09.378
It lets me drive in the carpool lane

00:09.379 --> 00:11.913
without having to use my
Burt Reynolds blowup doll.

00:13.725 --> 00:14.925
Well...

00:16.506 --> 00:19.750
It's the moment you've
all been waiting for.

00:19.751 --> 00:21.262
(Sniffs) Wait a minute.

00:21.950 --> 00:24.550
You went to a fancy
charity function last night.

00:24.669 --> 00:25.915
(Sniffs harder)

00:25.916 --> 00:28.289
I smell rich people things.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.511
Ooh, is it a swag bag?

00:30.512 --> 00:31.790
Please tell me it's a swag bag.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.120
Maybe.

00:33.121 --> 00:34.452
Wait, I don't get it. What's going on?

00:34.453 --> 00:37.146
Every time I go to a big event I get
this gift bag full of really cool stuff

00:37.147 --> 00:38.776
and I let Elliot and Yolanda divvy it up.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.904
But now Gabi's here, so you
gotta split it three ways.

00:40.905 --> 00:42.163
- Oh, man.
- Son of a bitch.

00:43.879 --> 00:45.444
All right, let's keep it civilized.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.579
And remember, it doesn't
start until I leave the room.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.155
- Oh-ho!
- Oh, my goodness! Uh-huh!

00:57.156 --> 00:58.342
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- What is it? What is it?

00:58.343 --> 01:00.190
Ooh, Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses.

01:00.209 --> 01:01.918
- A smartwatch!
- Ooh, ooh!

01:02.199 --> 01:04.183
A video camera?

01:04.370 --> 01:08.089
A 10-pack for soul spin classes!

01:08.286 --> 01:10.386
Why would you go to a spin class?

01:10.703 --> 01:12.756
You get winded walking
down the buffet line.

01:14.757 --> 01:18.611
Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal is in
San Francisco filming a movie.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.377
This is the place he goes
to spin when he's in town.

01:20.378 --> 01:21.578
(Gasps)

01:21.579 --> 01:24.392
Thank goodness we got a video camera!

01:24.423 --> 01:26.651
(Gasps) Ooh!

01:26.652 --> 01:29.987
Look, a $100 gift certificate
to the Royal Hotel and Spa.

01:30.022 --> 01:32.263
- (Laughs) Oh no, you score.
- (Flatly) That is the best.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.986
(Gasps) Whoa, 10 of them.

01:36.061 --> 01:37.677
- Mine. Mine.
- Mine. Mine.

01:37.678 --> 01:38.829
- Mine. Mine.
- Mine. Mine.

01:38.864 --> 01:40.414
- (Both) Mine. Mine.
- Aah!

01:40.466 --> 01:43.832
- Mine. Mine. Mine...
- Mine. Mine. Mine...

Oh, great.

02:13.358 --> 02:14.701
You know, that's why I'm celebrating

02:14.702 --> 02:17.051
with a big bag of marshmallows.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.685
(Gabi) Oh!

02:20.734 --> 02:23.062
Hey, what's with all the little pins

02:23.063 --> 02:25.200
on this pretty map you made?

02:25.201 --> 02:27.421
Oh, that's just to keep track

02:27.422 --> 02:28.838
of all the places I've applied...

02:28.839 --> 02:31.458
- That's fantastic.
- ...and got rejections from.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.601
Well remember, Sofia, it only
takes one employer to say yes.

02:35.602 --> 02:37.318
Well, one employer did say yes.

02:37.319 --> 02:38.984
- Yay!
- It was my dad.

02:40.704 --> 02:44.384
Yeah, he, ah, he thinks I
should move back home to Florida,

02:45.612 --> 02:47.576
and, ah, work for him.

02:47.877 --> 02:50.000
Aww, Sofia, you can't go home.

02:50.001 --> 02:53.054
Gabi, I've been unemployed for three
months. I'm at the end of my rope.

02:53.055 --> 02:55.239
I can't even afford
any more rejection pins.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.871
Okay, okay, enough, all right?

02:56.872 --> 02:59.032
Let's put the sad map away.

02:59.367 --> 03:01.757
You need to get out of this
apartment and have some fun.

03:01.758 --> 03:03.466
I'm not in the mood for fun.

03:04.354 --> 03:06.154
Well, what if I told you

03:06.155 --> 03:09.319
that I have $1,000 worth
of gift certificates

03:09.320 --> 03:12.400
to the Royal Hotel and... ♪ Spa? ♪

03:12.955 --> 03:15.605
- Thinking mani-pedis.
- Mani-pedis?

03:15.739 --> 03:17.574
- Blow outs.
- Blow outs?

03:17.575 --> 03:18.791
Maybe a massage.

03:18.792 --> 03:20.625
- A massage?
- Yeah.

03:20.660 --> 03:23.315
A total makeover ending
with fancy drinks at the bar.

03:23.316 --> 03:25.332
Fancy drinks? Yay!

03:25.749 --> 03:29.034
That'll totally be my
first drink of the day.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.300
Let's go!

03:37.398 --> 03:39.314
See. I told you this would cheer you up.

03:39.366 --> 03:41.366
Gabi, you were so right.

03:41.367 --> 03:42.838
I mean, I have no money, no job,

03:42.839 --> 03:44.625
and I'll probably still
have to move home to Florida,

03:44.626 --> 03:46.610
but I love my new smoky eyes.

03:46.611 --> 03:49.784
Aww, and I love your new attitude.

03:49.785 --> 03:51.243
What are you talking about?

03:51.245 --> 03:52.461
I'm just saying, you know,

03:52.496 --> 03:55.183
these past few months of
you trying to get a job

03:55.184 --> 03:57.397
has made you kinda negative.

03:58.237 --> 04:01.181
Well, what can I tell you?
Everything in my life sucks.

04:01.589 --> 04:04.306
I'm just saying I think you
need to start shaking things up.

04:04.341 --> 04:06.852
Think outside the box.
Start saying yes to life

04:06.853 --> 04:08.327
and new things...

04:08.362 --> 04:11.555
Like that guy over there. You know he's
been staring at you since you sat down.

04:12.566 --> 04:13.766
Oh, my God.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.527
Okay. Now's your chance.

04:16.528 --> 04:17.956
Do something Sofia would never do.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.877
Be bold. Be crazy. Go talk to him.

04:19.878 --> 04:21.821
You know what? I'm just gonna
wait for him to come to me.

04:21.822 --> 04:25.144
Oh, like you're waiting for all those
employers to come and talk to you?

04:25.145 --> 04:26.520
See, this is what I mean.

04:26.521 --> 04:28.891
You need to take action
and get some action.

04:30.334 --> 04:32.243
You know what? You're right.

04:32.244 --> 04:34.276
Like, what do I have to lose?

04:34.277 --> 04:37.022
- Nothing. 'Cause you got nothing.
- Yeah.

04:37.472 --> 04:38.677
Can I get you another round?

04:38.678 --> 04:41.557
Uh, yeah, I'll have
another vodka cran on ice.

04:41.695 --> 04:44.129
This coupon is only good for food.

04:44.531 --> 04:46.148
Okay, just the ice then.

04:47.785 --> 04:49.601
My God, Gabi, it worked!

04:49.637 --> 04:52.471
He asked me to dinner, and I said... yes.

04:52.506 --> 04:55.040
That's great! This calls for a celebration.

04:55.075 --> 04:57.550
(Claps) Ice for everyone!

05:06.951 --> 05:09.588
Okay, according to Jake
Gyllenhaal's publicist,

05:09.623 --> 05:11.556
this is the spin class he goes to.

05:11.826 --> 05:13.671
When you see him, be cool

05:13.672 --> 05:15.459
- don't do anything to embarrass me.
- Okay.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.757
(Gasps) It's him!

05:16.758 --> 05:18.520
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

05:18.685 --> 05:21.301
How can you tell? It's
so damn dark in here.

05:21.756 --> 05:22.999
Oh, wait.

05:23.475 --> 05:26.747
I had on my new Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses.

05:27.284 --> 05:30.083
I need my picture taken
working out with him

05:30.084 --> 05:32.839
so I can brag to my friends
and elevate my status.

05:37.444 --> 05:38.743
(Scoffs)

05:38.886 --> 05:41.833
This is what everybody's talking
about? A bunch of stationary bikes?

05:41.834 --> 05:43.651
Guys, I rode a bike to get here.

05:43.652 --> 05:45.076
This is lame. I'm out.

05:45.726 --> 05:47.198
Who's ready for a spin?

05:47.199 --> 05:48.399
Me.

05:50.128 --> 05:52.484
I'm ready for a spin. I'm
Josh. Do you spin here often?

05:52.485 --> 05:54.878
- Every day. It's my job.
- All right.

05:56.173 --> 05:57.373
All right...

05:57.374 --> 05:59.730
Wait. You two.

05:59.857 --> 06:01.790
You've never been to
a spin class, have you?

06:02.264 --> 06:03.475
How can you tell?

06:03.494 --> 06:05.130
Because I have eyes.

06:06.056 --> 06:07.787
Spin virgins go to the back row.

06:07.850 --> 06:09.050
Ugh.

06:09.587 --> 06:11.735
I'm being made fun of for being a virgin?

06:11.736 --> 06:13.653
It's like high school all over again.

06:16.156 --> 06:19.180
Ugh. Hey, great. Now how are we
gonna get our photo taken with Jake?

06:19.181 --> 06:21.323
You ever heard of a selfie stick, bitch?

06:28.936 --> 06:33.786
Uh-huh. Look who's finally home.

06:34.183 --> 06:36.070
I took your advice,

06:36.071 --> 06:38.054
and I said yes to life,

06:38.055 --> 06:41.088
to dinner, and to, um...
(clears throat) dessert.

06:41.089 --> 06:42.436
Hmm.

06:42.437 --> 06:45.659
Was it like ice cream
dessert, or you scream dessert?

06:47.805 --> 06:49.889
Oh my God, you know, I've
never done that before.

06:49.890 --> 06:51.128
I mean, I've done that before,

06:51.129 --> 06:52.592
but never like that, you know?

06:52.593 --> 06:54.282
- Aww.
- I'm a nice girl

06:54.283 --> 06:55.998
who did a bad girl thing.

06:56.525 --> 06:57.824
I'm so proud of you.

06:57.941 --> 06:59.507
You were so right!

06:59.508 --> 07:01.044
Letting go is fun.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.534
I said yes to life,

07:02.535 --> 07:05.273
and found a funny, charming, and uh,

07:05.371 --> 07:07.931
very romantic guy.

07:08.544 --> 07:12.196
Aww, he left me a note.

07:12.197 --> 07:14.955
- Aww!
- Did I tell you he was romantic?

07:14.956 --> 07:16.350
Open it, open it! What's it say?

07:22.360 --> 07:24.219
It's $500.

07:24.565 --> 07:26.641
Well, why would he give you 500...

07:29.519 --> 07:31.242
Oh my God, you don't think he thinks I'm...

07:31.243 --> 07:33.166
No, I don't think he thinks you're...

07:34.076 --> 07:35.848
What did you think that he thought?

07:36.421 --> 07:38.421
- That I'm a hooker?
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.259
Oh, my God!

07:41.260 --> 07:44.261
No, it's okay, it's
okay! It's all right, hey.

07:44.262 --> 07:45.834
Look on the bright side...

07:45.984 --> 07:47.759
At least you finally got a job.

07:51.352 --> 07:53.157
Oh, my God! I'm a hooker!

07:53.158 --> 07:54.773
No!

07:54.774 --> 07:57.731
You're not a hooker, he
just thought you were.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.391
- This is your fault, Gabi.
- My fault?

08:01.392 --> 08:04.068
Yes! "Say yes to life, Sofia."

08:04.069 --> 08:05.410
Well, I said yes to life,

08:05.411 --> 08:08.690
and now I'm just a ho with
$78 in her bank account.

08:09.861 --> 08:13.133
Technically, $578.

08:13.311 --> 08:16.029
Shut up, shut up! I'm
not gonna keep that money.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.771
That's dirty! That's dirty, dirty money.

08:19.504 --> 08:21.628
Come on, I think this is
gonna be a really funny story

08:21.629 --> 08:24.105
- to tell your kids one day.
- No, this is it. This is it, Gabi!

08:24.106 --> 08:27.267
This is the universe telling
me to move back home to Florida.

08:27.380 --> 08:30.828
I'm just... I'm totally
broke, and totally broken.

08:31.003 --> 08:34.393
Aww, you're gonna be fine,
we'll figure something out.

08:34.394 --> 08:37.368
You know, when things were
tough, I used to tell myself,

08:37.369 --> 08:39.419
"well, at least you're not a hooker."

08:42.097 --> 08:44.249
Now I can't even say that.

08:44.930 --> 08:47.697
Well, you can, it just won't be true.

08:52.838 --> 08:54.137
Let me get this straight,

08:54.138 --> 08:55.739
you were standing right next to Sofia,

08:55.774 --> 08:58.375
and someone thought she was the prostitute?

08:58.427 --> 09:00.227
(Laughs)

09:00.228 --> 09:01.428
Oww.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.986
Elliot, this is serious, okay?
Sofia's really devastated.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.946
Well, at least she can lift her legs.

09:07.119 --> 09:09.052
And get paid for it.

09:09.054 --> 09:10.370
(Laughing)

09:10.406 --> 09:11.879
(Both) Oww.

09:12.157 --> 09:15.763
What possessed you two to think you could
get through an entire class of soul spin?

09:15.764 --> 09:17.744
Did you at least get a
picture of Jake Gyllenhaal?

09:17.745 --> 09:20.479
Sort of. All I got was one of his foot.

09:20.547 --> 09:23.173
He's got some big feet.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.886
That's my foot, fool!

09:28.111 --> 09:30.983
Guess who's got a date with
that hot spin instructor?

09:31.610 --> 09:33.045
This guy!

09:33.345 --> 09:36.704
Wait, how did you take the same
class we did and you're still walking?

09:36.741 --> 09:38.809
Well, I exercise every day and I eat right.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.438
Well, that's where we differ.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.086
Um, Josh, can I talk
to you about something?

09:44.460 --> 09:47.818
Everybody wants a piece of me today, huh?

09:48.210 --> 09:49.410
Popular guy.

09:49.411 --> 09:50.611
Talk to me.

09:50.617 --> 09:51.962
Okay, this is kind of serious.

09:51.963 --> 09:53.864
Can I get sweet Josh or not-cocky Josh?

09:53.865 --> 09:54.898
You got it. What's wrong, babe?

09:54.900 --> 09:56.100
That was kind of a halfsie.

09:59.310 --> 10:00.576
What's going on?

10:00.743 --> 10:02.505
Sofia's thinking of moving home to Florida

10:02.506 --> 10:03.889
because she slept with a guy last night

10:03.890 --> 10:05.465
who thought she was a hooker.

10:05.577 --> 10:07.339
Did not see that one coming.

10:07.427 --> 10:09.983
I have to do something, something
that's gonna turn this around.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.879
And I don't know what
that something is. Do you?

10:11.917 --> 10:13.911
Okay, look, it's Sofia
we're talking about here.

10:13.912 --> 10:15.604
There's obviously some kind of mistake.

10:15.605 --> 10:19.240
Well, he slipped an envelope with
$500 in her purse after they had sex.

10:20.907 --> 10:22.356
Maybe it was meant for someone else?

10:22.357 --> 10:24.828
- Was her name on the envelope?
- No.

10:24.829 --> 10:26.830
- Was there a note?
- No.

10:26.831 --> 10:28.216
So, the money could have been for anybody.

10:28.217 --> 10:29.660
He could have left it for housekeeping.

10:29.661 --> 10:32.090
Or maybe his assistant, or his bookie.

10:32.209 --> 10:33.930
My God, you're right!

10:33.931 --> 10:35.972
Sofia's not a hooker, she's just a thief.

10:42.364 --> 10:44.945
Hi. Do you remember me from last night?

10:44.946 --> 10:48.383
I was with my friend... short
dress, stilettos, smoky eyes?

10:48.420 --> 10:49.862
Oh, the hooker.

10:50.189 --> 10:52.889
She's not! Why would you think that?

10:52.925 --> 10:55.156
Short dress, stilettos, smoky eyes.

10:55.157 --> 10:56.756
Okay, she's not a hooker. She's lovely.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.645
- She's super sweet...
- Let me guess.

10:58.646 --> 11:00.170
- Heart of gold?
- No!

11:01.350 --> 11:02.632
I mean, yes.

11:02.634 --> 11:03.834
But, the point is

11:03.835 --> 11:05.836
that after last night's misunderstanding

11:05.837 --> 11:08.219
she's so upset that she's
considering moving home to Florida

11:08.220 --> 11:10.373
to work at her father's grocery store.

11:10.409 --> 11:11.992
Ooh, checkout girl.

11:11.993 --> 11:13.343
That's one of my fantasies.

11:13.378 --> 11:14.695
Stop it.

11:14.696 --> 11:16.805
She's my best friend, and
I'm not letting her move home.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.273
So, here's what we're gonna do, okay?

11:18.274 --> 11:19.430
You're gonna record a message to her,

11:19.431 --> 11:21.459
saying that the envelope
that she found in her purse

11:21.460 --> 11:23.007
must have fallen off the night stand

11:23.008 --> 11:24.460
because it was meant for housekeeping.

11:24.461 --> 11:25.997
- Okay, ready, go!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.827
I'm sorry your friend's upset,
but I'm not recording anything.

11:28.828 --> 11:30.098
How do I know you're not a cop?

11:30.280 --> 11:32.914
What is that? Like another
one of your sick fantasies?

11:33.865 --> 11:35.262
I'm a chef.

11:35.263 --> 11:36.955
Even though that's kind of hot, too.

11:37.503 --> 11:40.537
I am the personal chef
to Mr. Josh Kaminski.

11:40.672 --> 11:43.323
Josh Kaminski? The software developer?

11:43.358 --> 11:44.911
Yeah, I think that's what he does.

11:46.545 --> 11:49.320
I am the regional director
for Star Bright Cruises.

11:49.321 --> 11:52.367
I'm hosting the captain's dinner Thursday
night, and my caterer just dropped out.

11:52.368 --> 11:53.736
You by any chance available?

11:53.737 --> 11:56.543
Seriously? No, I would never
work for you. Never ever.

11:56.544 --> 11:57.787
The gig pays five grand.

11:57.823 --> 11:59.918
How does Asian fusion sound?

12:04.963 --> 12:08.536
I still can't believe that that
was your first time in spin class.

12:08.537 --> 12:09.893
You're quite an athlete.

12:09.894 --> 12:12.580
Well, you know, I've never
referred to myself as an athlete,

12:12.581 --> 12:14.504
but, now that you mention
it, it's pretty accurate.

12:14.539 --> 12:16.273
(Chuckles)

12:16.275 --> 12:18.015
I guess I have a type.

12:18.073 --> 12:20.327
The last four guys I dated
were all basketball players.

12:20.362 --> 12:22.379
Ah, the old b-ball.

12:23.247 --> 12:26.883
You know, I've been known to get into
a little two-on-two on the weekends.

12:26.918 --> 12:28.251
No, I meant professional.

12:28.287 --> 12:32.856
I've dated a warrior, a rocket,
a timber wolf, and a raptor.

12:32.891 --> 12:36.191
Oh, so I'm the first tech
guy you've ever dated?

12:36.192 --> 12:37.516
Yeah.

12:37.517 --> 12:40.298
It's gonna be different going
out with a guy who's not so huge.

12:40.299 --> 12:41.499
(Coughs)

12:47.941 --> 12:49.791
Guess what?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.842
I have a huge surprise.

12:51.843 --> 12:53.709
- What?
- I got a catering gig!

12:54.046 --> 12:56.145
You got another job?

12:57.911 --> 13:00.645
You have two jobs, I can't even get one!

13:00.646 --> 13:03.541
No, no, no I only took the
job because it pays five grand.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.072
Five grand?

13:05.496 --> 13:08.230
I'd have to sleep with that
guy 10 times to make that.

13:08.231 --> 13:11.057
Okay, okay, just calm down, all right?

13:11.058 --> 13:12.265
I only took the gig

13:12.266 --> 13:15.088
so that I can cover your
expenses until you find a job.

13:15.089 --> 13:17.020
Yay!

13:17.669 --> 13:20.156
Gabi, that's very sweet,
but I can't let you do that.

13:20.157 --> 13:22.991
Well, you don't let me do a lot
of things, but I still do them.

13:23.475 --> 13:25.731
Gabi, it's not about the money, or rent,

13:25.732 --> 13:29.106
or the fact that someone
tried to pay me for sex.

13:29.147 --> 13:31.908
I just... I feel lost here, you know?

13:31.909 --> 13:33.412
I don't have anything going on.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.343
Well, I'll be lost without you,
you can't leave me. Please don't go.

13:37.344 --> 13:39.410
Gabi, I can't afford to stay.

13:39.825 --> 13:42.792
Okay, remember when I
told you to take action?

13:42.794 --> 13:44.271
Well, it's my turn.

13:44.294 --> 13:45.676
You're not leaving!

13:45.931 --> 13:48.886
I took this job so I can cover your
expenses for the next few months!

13:48.887 --> 13:51.396
And I love you, and I will
not take no for an answer!

13:54.061 --> 13:56.506
Well, that's the sweetest thing
that's ever been yelled at me.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.049
Aww.

13:58.268 --> 14:00.035
So, you'll stay?

14:00.145 --> 14:01.594
Well, on one condition.

14:01.595 --> 14:03.287
I'm gonna help you with this catering gig.

14:03.288 --> 14:05.809
Aww... no...

14:06.684 --> 14:09.394
- No, no, I-I...
- That's not necessary.

14:09.395 --> 14:10.826
Gabi, I insist.

14:10.827 --> 14:13.877
I will not be a kept woman.
Been there, done that.

14:14.267 --> 14:16.960
Okay, I'm gonna help you with this job.

14:16.995 --> 14:19.994
I-I'll be your sous chef,
your... your busser, your server,

14:19.995 --> 14:21.332
I will not leave your side.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.289
Plus, you know, it'll... it'll
help me take my mind off the guy

14:23.290 --> 14:24.842
who thought I was a hooker.

14:26.402 --> 14:27.602
Will it?

14:34.018 --> 14:35.701
- Oww. Oww.
- Oww.

14:35.736 --> 14:36.802
- Oww.
- Oww.

14:36.838 --> 14:38.571
- Oww!
- Oww.

14:38.606 --> 14:40.773
- Oww. Oww. Oww.
- Oww. Oww.

14:40.808 --> 14:42.541
- Quick question.
- Oww...

14:43.611 --> 14:46.759
If you were used to this
big bottle of olive oil,

14:48.178 --> 14:50.946
someone gave you this
smaller bottle of olive oil,

14:51.385 --> 14:53.052
would you point at it and laugh?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.103
What?

14:57.149 --> 15:01.276
It's just, would you be disappointed
in this smaller bottle of olive oil

15:01.277 --> 15:03.971
even though the smaller bottle of
olive oil never had a complaint?

15:05.143 --> 15:07.667
What... what's with the
sudden interest in olive oil?

15:07.668 --> 15:10.683
Yolanda, wake up and
smell the penis metaphor.

15:12.575 --> 15:16.073
It's just, I'm going out with Kayla,
and she's only ever been with...

15:16.596 --> 15:18.095
big olive oils.

15:20.316 --> 15:23.158
Josh, that myth about
olive oils isn't true.

15:23.292 --> 15:24.492
The last four guys she dated

15:24.493 --> 15:27.016
were professional basketball
players all over 6'7".

15:27.017 --> 15:28.459
Oh yeah, you in trouble.

15:31.249 --> 15:34.261
Josh, my problem just got bigger.

15:34.262 --> 15:35.784
Well, that makes one of us!

15:39.997 --> 15:42.698
Hey, guys, can I get
your advice on something?

15:42.699 --> 15:43.899
Ugh.

15:43.972 --> 15:47.540
Damn you, soul spin and my
inability to get away from Gabi.

15:49.222 --> 15:51.930
Hey, are you guys still sore
from that one soul spin class?

15:51.931 --> 15:53.765
I've never been in such pain.

15:53.766 --> 15:55.349
I can't even lift my arms.

15:56.963 --> 15:58.411
Wait a minute.

15:58.982 --> 16:02.272
So, if you were a cater
waiter assisting me,

16:02.273 --> 16:03.985
could you hold this tray?

16:08.158 --> 16:09.358
No.

16:13.152 --> 16:15.497
Gabi, this was such a great idea!

16:15.498 --> 16:17.482
I've been so stressed out about everything.

16:17.517 --> 16:18.799
Yeah. Did you stretch?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.000
- No.
- Okay, great.

16:20.001 --> 16:21.820
Hold my phone, I'm gonna get some towels.

16:21.821 --> 16:23.488
(Phone rings)

16:23.925 --> 16:26.432
Uh, Gabi, (phone ringing continues)

16:26.433 --> 16:31.540
why are you getting a call from
"John who thought Sofia was a hooker"?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.241
Ma-huh?

16:34.701 --> 16:35.934
Gabi, start talking.

16:35.935 --> 16:37.135
Okay.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.631
I went to the hotel bar

16:38.632 --> 16:40.350
because I knew that you were upset
that John called you a hooker.

16:40.351 --> 16:43.126
So, I confronted him, thinking maybe he
made a mistake and the money was actually

16:43.127 --> 16:46.454
for the housekeeper, but I was
wrong, he did think you were a hooker.

16:46.455 --> 16:48.839
So, I demanded he apologize,
but then he thought I was a cop,

16:48.840 --> 16:52.186
so I had to tell him I was a chef, then
he offered me a $5,000 catering job,

16:52.187 --> 16:53.701
which you insisted on helping me with!

16:53.702 --> 16:55.777
And so now we're here because I
thought maybe if you came here,

16:55.778 --> 16:58.546
you'd be too sore to work tomorrow.
So I'm really really sorry.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.525
Oh my God, oh my God, you are so lucky

17:02.526 --> 17:05.005
that I'm about to pedal
off all this rage right now!

17:05.006 --> 17:06.717
(Intercom) <i>Attention, cyclists,</i>

17:06.718 --> 17:09.782
<i>we're sorry to report Brad is
sick and class is canceled.</i>

17:10.066 --> 17:13.003
No!

17:13.410 --> 17:14.705
Uh-oh.

17:14.747 --> 17:18.741
No one is going anywhere because
this class is not canceled!

17:19.094 --> 17:21.378
I think everyone should listen to her.

17:21.381 --> 17:23.448
Stop talking, Gabi, and start pedaling.

17:23.449 --> 17:26.217
(Energetic music plays)

17:26.218 --> 17:28.361
No one's gonna tell me
that there's no class today.

17:28.362 --> 17:29.562
Ha!

17:29.763 --> 17:33.224
Isn't anyone else just tired of hearing no?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.647
(Crowd) Yeah!

17:35.395 --> 17:38.588
And aren't you tired of not
getting what you want out of life?

17:38.589 --> 17:39.789
(Crowd) Yeah!

17:39.790 --> 17:41.757
Sick of being called a hooker?

17:43.003 --> 17:45.336
All right, well, just... just...
just forget that last one.

17:45.337 --> 17:47.002
Now get up, we're on a hill!

17:47.200 --> 17:49.175
Come on, let's go! I said get up!

17:49.593 --> 17:52.222
Oh, what the matter? Is
your boss being mean to you?

17:52.223 --> 17:55.563
Well, try not having a boss because
you've been unemployed for three months!

17:55.564 --> 17:56.764
Pedal faster!

17:56.765 --> 17:59.826
Oh, and look at you in
your fancy soul spin gear.

17:59.827 --> 18:01.180
How could you afford all that?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.672
Do you not have to pay rent
because you live with your parents?

18:03.673 --> 18:05.833
Well, that's not gonna be me!

18:06.105 --> 18:08.972
Because I enjoy my independence!

18:08.973 --> 18:11.162
- (Crowd) Yeah!
- I like my freedom!

18:11.163 --> 18:13.187
- (Crowd) Yeah!
- So, you know what that means?

18:13.188 --> 18:16.794
I'm not moving home to Florida!

18:17.971 --> 18:19.212
You're not?

18:19.213 --> 18:21.906
No. I guess I'm not.

18:23.176 --> 18:24.826
Who said you could slow down?

18:24.827 --> 18:26.027
Push ups!

18:26.028 --> 18:27.865
(Sofia claps encouragement)

18:30.850 --> 18:32.550
- Whew.
- Whoa.

18:32.602 --> 18:34.485
Sofia, that was amazing.

18:34.486 --> 18:36.120
And when you shouted at us in Spanish,

18:36.121 --> 18:37.384
you sounded even meaner.

18:38.425 --> 18:40.224
Oh my God, I was talking in Spanish?

18:40.260 --> 18:41.688
Ha! I didn't even realize.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.783
Something just came over me, and
I had to take charge, you know?

18:44.846 --> 18:47.214
Oh God, it felt so good
to be in control again.

18:47.784 --> 18:49.888
You know, the only reason
I took that catering job

18:49.889 --> 18:52.104
was to keep you here in San
Francisco with me, right?

18:52.105 --> 18:54.222
I know. But don't worry. Like I said,

18:54.223 --> 18:55.707
I'm not going anywhere.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.775
I don't know how, but I will figure it out.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.137
We'll figure it out.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.639
Aww. All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

19:02.436 --> 19:03.806
I'd love to, you know,

19:03.807 --> 19:06.634
but I... I cannot feel my legs!

19:07.504 --> 19:09.354
<i>Ay, dios mios!</i>

19:13.693 --> 19:15.368
You're welcome.

19:16.246 --> 19:19.717
Hey, that was a great
class. Where do you teach?

19:19.718 --> 19:22.352
Oh, I-I don't. I just
take classes at the Y.

19:23.503 --> 19:26.904
You're a natural. Motivating
people and yelling at them?

19:26.940 --> 19:28.172
That's a real gift.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.587
- Thank you.
- Yeah, she does it at home, too.

19:30.944 --> 19:32.662
Well, I'm the head instructor here,

19:32.663 --> 19:35.043
would you be interested in working for us?

19:35.244 --> 19:36.648
Wha-huh?

19:36.770 --> 19:39.284
Uh, what she means is yes! Yes, she would.

19:39.285 --> 19:41.101
- Well, how soon can you start?
- How's now?

19:41.589 --> 19:42.789
You're hired.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.658
I'll meet you in the back office to
talk wage, commission, and benefits.

19:45.659 --> 19:48.089
Wage, commission, and benefits, oh my.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.904
Okay. I'll see you in a second.

19:52.749 --> 19:55.478
My God, you're a working girl again!

19:55.479 --> 19:57.750
And I mean that in the nice way.

19:58.672 --> 20:00.589
Wow, see what happens when you say

20:00.590 --> 20:02.187
- yes...
- Oh, shut up!

20:02.440 --> 20:03.975
It feels good to be back.

20:12.347 --> 20:13.654
How's your salad?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.520
Amazing, I love it.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.774
It's a little light on
the olive oil, though.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.523
Here you go.

20:25.524 --> 20:26.724
(Giggles)

20:26.725 --> 20:29.362
Aww, that is the tiniest bottle

20:29.363 --> 20:31.094
of olive oil I've ever seen.

20:31.131 --> 20:32.673
It's so cute.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.962
I have a perfectly normal-sized penis!

20:43.211 --> 20:44.501
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

20:44.502 --> 20:45.702
Probably for the best.
