00:06.666 --> 00:08.125
Wow. Time slipping.

00:10.458 --> 00:12.916
The Temporal Loom is the heart of the TVA.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.833
It's where raw time is refined
into physical timeline.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.208
The more those branches grow,

00:17.291 --> 00:19.166
the closer this thing
comes to melting down.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.291
So, how do we get in?

00:20.458 --> 00:22.166
Only the person
who designed it can open it

00:22.250 --> 00:23.833

O.B.: You'll stand by to prune yourself

00:41.250 --> 00:43.000
Green means prune.

LOKI: The TVA is in danger.
I was in the future and I saw you.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.375
I need to know why.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.000
We stay here, we're all gonna die.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.750
SYLVIE: They're gonna bomb every branch.

00:52.833 --> 00:54.208
Set off what you can!

00:55.416 --> 00:58.875
You asked me what I would do
if one of his Variants turned up.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.625
-I'd kill him.
-You don't know me.

01:01.708 --> 01:02.750
Get him out of here.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.291
It's power for you, isn't it?

01:05.250 --> 01:07.458

01:07.541 --> 01:11.000

02:01.500 --> 02:03.000

02:09.541 --> 02:11.041
So, it's almost ready.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.916
A utopia at the end of time.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.416

you are quite a marvel.

I will be proud to lead with you.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.708
You made a difference in this war.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.625
Thank you for being on my team.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.291
The TVA awaits our commands.

02:59.041 --> 03:00.291
Shall we go?

03:02.125 --> 03:03.208
I'll catch up.

03:06.916 --> 03:08.416
It's been a long road.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.791
See you soon.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.166
Always.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.208
Hey, boss. Fancy a game of chess?

03:29.083 --> 03:32.291

03:35.458 --> 03:37.500
Erase her memories.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.458
Are you sure?

03:40.375 --> 03:41.916
Erase all of their memories.

03:42.291 --> 03:43.750
If you say so.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.375
I'm sorry.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.083
I was here.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.125
MISS MINUTES: Yes.

04:01.916 --> 04:03.458
I helped win?

04:03.541 --> 04:08.083
You didn't just help. It was you
who commanded the army.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.583
So he built this little tower.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.000
And while he sat on his throne...

04:19.666 --> 04:22.250
I continued to do all the work
to keep him there?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.541
Well, something like that.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.250
RENSLAYER: So, what are you proposing?

04:29.625 --> 04:33.791

Maybe we never did.

what Renslayer and Miss Minutes have been
saying about us, but it's not true.

that the TVA has to change,

She's a general of the TVA,
and she wants to protect it at all costs.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.125
That was her mission.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.708
And it can be again,

08:29.791 --> 08:34.583
if you can convince her that this
new version is worth protecting, too.

a brilliant 19th-century inventor

named Victor Timely.
If he'd had the resources,

09:49.208 --> 09:51.208
he would have been bigger than Einstein.

-Victor.

-Exactly. Which came first?
-It's like a snake eating its own tail.

10:08.208 --> 10:12.083
Mr. Ouroboros,
would you inscribe my handbook?

10:13.208 --> 10:15.083
Only if you inscribe mine.

10:15.166 --> 10:19.916
I was living in
your engineering descriptions.

10:20.041 --> 10:23.375

the electric bypass system...

10:23.458 --> 10:25.833
-The bypass.
-Poetry, just poetry.

10:25.916 --> 10:31.083
Guys, sorry to break up this bromance,
but can we fix now and sign later?

10:31.166 --> 10:32.208
Yeah, let's go.

10:32.291 --> 10:33.833
O.B., how's it going?

10:33.916 --> 10:36.208
Uh, we have a... We have a good plan.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.208
-Okay.
-O.B.: It's a pretty good plan.

10:38.291 --> 10:39.958
-We have a plan. Casey?
-Oh.

10:42.958 --> 10:47.458
Here's a model I mocked up of the Loom.
Forgive the shoddy and slapdash work.

10:47.541 --> 10:50.666
It's not to scale.
I only got one coat of paint on there.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.458
I haven't been able to carve out figures
to represent all of us.

10:53.541 --> 10:54.541

10:54.958 --> 10:57.208
I'm honestly embarrassed
that Victor's here to see it.

MOBIUS: You're being hard on yourself.
It looks great.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.375
All right. What's the plan?

11:04.750 --> 11:05.791
O.B.: It's simple.

11:05.875 --> 11:10.791
One of us will have to take our
Throughput Multiplier down the gangway.

11:10.916 --> 11:13.958
Load the Throughput Multiplier
into the launcher.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.333
Then, they'll need to hit
the green button...

11:17.416 --> 11:20.875
-CASEY: Green button.
-...and launch it towards the Loom.

11:20.958 --> 11:22.958
It will dock with the Loom,

11:23.041 --> 11:27.958
where it will scale the Loom's capacity
to manage the backlog of branches

11:28.041 --> 11:29.500
that was created when...

11:30.875 --> 11:36.833
someone killed He Who Remains and released
all those branches and ruined my life.

11:36.916 --> 11:41.333
Hang on. What's the connection between
the Throughput Multiplier and the Loom?

11:41.416 --> 11:43.875
The rings of the Loom aren't wide enough.

11:43.958 --> 11:45.125
That's correct.

11:47.250 --> 11:53.333
We need to make the rings bigger,
so more branches can fit through.

11:53.416 --> 11:57.541
But there's one gigantic problem.

11:57.625 --> 11:58.625
-Big.
-LOKI: What's that?

11:58.708 --> 12:02.541

you went out there, Mobius.

-Just because it isn't you, it isn't me.
-O.B.: Listen, guys.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.125
-It's got your shape.
-It's got my shape?

12:28.208 --> 12:30.708
-It's a suit. Could be anybody.
-It's wearing a helmet.

waiting for? Let's do this.

CASEY: There's another problem.
LOKI: What's that?

12:47.750 --> 12:53.041
O.B.: This whole plan is only theoretical
because our Throughput Multiplier

-does not yet work.

-SYLVIE: It doesn't work.
-Wait. Let me guess.

12:58.791 --> 13:02.666
The Loom's temporal decay outpaces

13:02.750 --> 13:06.583
your Multiplier's throughput capabilities.

13:06.666 --> 13:09.125
Every time, yeah. How did you know that?

13:09.208 --> 13:13.708
Because I had the same problem
with my Loom...

13:15.708 --> 13:17.375
until I made this.

would take a long time.

No, I won't wait. Come on.
Let's go and get some pie. Why not?

14:24.500 --> 14:28.625

that the branches are dying?

But I think, I think
if we put our heads together

15:38.958 --> 15:42.208
and if we just try to figure this out,
we can get out of this room

15:42.291 --> 15:44.333

He Who Remains wasn't scared.

Maybe he was, and I just didn't notice.

19:29.916 --> 19:33.083
Some years ago,
my brother was banished from Asgard

19:34.541 --> 19:35.958
and sent to Earth.

19:37.791 --> 19:40.125
And when he came back, he was different.

Changed somehow.

I thought it was weakness.

19:54.541 --> 19:58.375
and because of that,
the TVA and those timelines will survive.

19:58.458 --> 20:02.166
Those people will survive.
You spared their lives, too.

-What about those branches

this place can be any better?

20:36.250 --> 20:38.041
What if I was wrong to spare him?

It would just be easier to burn
this place down and start from scratch.

Sure. Burn it down. Easy.

Okay, so Timely can save the TVA.

21:10.625 --> 21:15.833
Then, we hope that the TVA
turns into something good.

21:17.166 --> 21:22.166
Then, we hope that Timely doesn't
turn into He Who Remains or someone worse.

That's a lot of hoping, Loki.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.125
This is the best option we have.

So, you're gonna bring him
behind the curtain, show him all of this,

21:37.500 --> 21:40.208
and then just send him home?

21:40.291 --> 21:44.666
Maybe that's a good thing.
We can watch him, protect him.

Hello?

35:46.541 --> 35:48.958
About time.
What's taking you guys so long?

O.B.?

(RUMBLING)

-Hurry.
-Miss Minutes is sabotaging everything,

35:57.333 --> 35:59.416
-slowing us down.
-What?

36:00.791 --> 36:03.791
I could take her offline
if I reboot the system.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Reboot the system.

36:06.541 --> 36:08.875
-But we'll lose the entire safety system.
-So what?

36:08.958 --> 36:10.375
What are we gonna lose?

36:10.458 --> 36:12.125
O.B.: The security protocols will go down.

36:12.208 --> 36:13.458
MOBIUS: Like what?

36:13.541 --> 36:16.708
Like the dampeners that prevent people
from using magic at the TVA.

36:16.791 --> 36:18.833
We would have to turn that off too.

36:20.291 --> 36:21.416
-Turn it off!
-Turn it off!

36:24.125 --> 36:28.916
This is where the Multiplier goes.

36:29.291 --> 36:31.708

MISS MINUTES: That's not another
power surge. Let me investigate.

36:42.250 --> 36:46.625
(STUTTERING) Someone's trying to
reboot the system. I can't access it.

36:46.708 --> 36:48.833
I'm being locked out.

36:49.333 --> 36:51.916
Well, mocking is... just isn't necessary.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.250
They're up to something.
What's happening to you?

36:55.333 --> 37:00.083
They're taking me offline.
I'm losing my cognitive facilities.

37:00.166 --> 37:01.666

Hi. I'm Miss Minutes.
(STUTTERING) And the time...

Come here for a second.

-Come here. Come here. Come here.
-What is going on?

38:41.208 --> 38:43.250
I didn't think I'd see you again so soon.

-What?

-This way. Elevator.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.416
You saved my life.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.250
Time for you to return the favor.
Let's go.

-O.B., he's here.
-Come on. Hurry. Right here.

39:12.625 --> 39:14.958
-Victor, this way. What do we need to do?
-Over here.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.750
The Throughput Multiplier
is waiting in the airlock.

39:17.833 --> 39:20.500
But first,
we need Mr. Timely's Aura scanned

39:20.583 --> 39:22.208
so we can get the blast doors open.

39:22.291 --> 39:24.833
-Okay, let's go.
-Just put your head in the scanner.

39:26.791 --> 39:28.041
Is that safe?

39:28.125 --> 39:30.250
I haven't tested it. Theoretically...

39:31.125 --> 39:32.125
LOKI: It's all right.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.583
You'll be fine.

You did it.

40:04.250 --> 40:05.666
O.B.: It's worse than I thought.

40:06.833 --> 40:08.416
We have to move fast.

40:08.958 --> 40:10.041
Who's it gonna be?

40:10.125 --> 40:12.833
I'll do it. I'll put the suit on.

40:12.916 --> 40:15.375
MOBIUS: Okay, let's go then.
HUNTER B-15: Come on, let's move.

40:15.458 --> 40:19.333

40:19.416 --> 40:21.041

40:22.416 --> 40:23.541
But I do.

40:25.625 --> 40:27.750
Something wrong could happen

40:27.833 --> 40:31.416
and I know how
the Throughput Multiplier works.

-Okay.
-Okay, let's go. Come on.

get down the gangway as fast as you can.

launch it and get back. Got it?

Got it.

-Okay.
-Okay.

Time to be brave.

40:57.708 --> 40:58.750
Good luck.

41:02.125 --> 41:03.458

41:06.583 --> 41:07.583
How long will he have?

41:07.666 --> 41:09.208
-O.B.: Not long.
-He'll make it.

41:09.291 --> 41:11.333
Yeah, I don't know about
these radiation levels.
