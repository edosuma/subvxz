{\an3}- Did you?
How was that?

26:56.414 --> 26:59.417
{\an1}- Wasn't bad,
but it wasn't great.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.019
{\an1}Um, he said he didn't want
a girlfriend,

27:01.086 --> 27:02.787
{\an1}and then he gave me a [bleep]
six

27:02.854 --> 27:05.090
{\an1}on a [bleep] scale
from one to girlfriend.

27:05.156 --> 27:06.491
- Gave you a six?
- Yeah.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.026
{\an8}- I might do a lot
of do dumb [bleep].

27:08.093 --> 27:10.328
{\an8}One thing I'm not gonna do
is call her a six.

27:10.395 --> 27:11.863
{\an8}- Seems like a winner.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.698
- What would you rate me
on a scale of one to ten?

27:13.765 --> 27:15.266
- Not a six.
- Thank you.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.701
He did that.

27:16.768 --> 27:19.070
{\an3}- I'd give you better
than a six.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.939
{\an3}Um, I'm here for you,
you know?

27:21.006 --> 27:22.841

I sometimes want to sleep with.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.622
{\an3}- I'm excited to get back
to the old ways.

be an issue.

27:41.926 --> 27:43.895
Well, you know, I've always
had, like, a thing for you.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.030

- Yeah.

27:45.096 --> 27:46.865
No pressure.

27:46.931 --> 27:50.769
{\an7}But pressure.
Okay?

27:50.835 --> 27:53.271
{\an8}- I know Devin.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.806
