00:11.480 --> 00:14.760
Good morning, ladies of Ridge Heights,

00:14.760 --> 00:16.920
<i>any oil rig workers, mountain Sherpas,</i>

00:16.920 --> 00:20.880
<i>or International Space Station listeners
who might have survived the Pocko, too.</i>

00:20.880 --> 00:23.280
<i>It's been 44 days since the waters rose,</i>

00:23.280 --> 00:25.520
<i>and, not to brag,
but we're kind of killing it.</i>

00:25.520 --> 00:27.760
<i>Not that I'm surprised.
If you've ever been</i>

00:27.760 --> 00:30.880
<i>to a hens' party weekend at a beach house
with a 10:00 a.m. checkout,</i>

00:30.880 --> 00:34.560
<i>then you know that women get shit done.</i>

00:36.120 --> 00:39.000
<i>Everyone knows that the key
to a successful hens' weekend</i>

00:39.000 --> 00:40.120
<i>is the maid of honour,</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:43.440
<i>and Saskia Vanderbeek
is that woman for us.</i>

00:43.440 --> 00:46.120
What do we say? Ride or die!

00:46.120 --> 00:47.200
Ride or die!

00:47.200 --> 00:49.160
-  Ride or die!
-  Ride or die!

00:49.160 --> 00:50.840
Ride or die!

00:52.120 --> 00:54.280
<i>Is she a pain in the ass?
Yes, she is.</i>

00:54.280 --> 00:56.880
<i>But would you want her job? Fuck, no.</i>

01:05.560 --> 01:08.520
<i>Because without that woman,
we don't get the cheese plates,</i>

01:08.520 --> 01:10.000
<i>or the table with the view,</i>

01:10.000 --> 01:12.480
<i>or the matching monogrammed robes
that you never wear again,</i>

01:12.480 --> 01:14.160
<i>but you still have to pay for.</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:16.520
Mooncup's on loan, folks.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.720
But she always bleeds long.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.880
<i>And thanks to her insistence
on excessive exercise, limited rations,</i>

01:31.880 --> 01:35.920
<i>and immaculate personal grooming,
we've kind of never looked better.</i>

01:38.720 --> 01:40.360
Come on, faster. Harder!

01:40.880 --> 01:43.320
We're riding to radio for rescue! Come on!

01:43.320 --> 01:45.080
Go! Go!

01:45.080 --> 01:46.760
Go!

01:46.760 --> 01:49.920
<i>I know, I know.
It's like, who cares, you know?</i>

01:49.920 --> 01:51.400
<i>No one's checking us out.</i>

01:51.400 --> 01:55.160
<i>But, somehow, our hair has become
the last vestige of our normality.</i>

01:55.720 --> 01:58.840
<i>And we are not fucking letting it go.</i>

01:59.600 --> 02:01.560
And that's our show for today, folks.

02:01.560 --> 02:05.720
If anyone is out there listening,
please drop us a rescue boat anytime.

02:05.720 --> 02:11.440
We're at 34.4100 degrees south
and 150.3037 degrees east.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.240
Over and out, folks.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.560
You're late.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.160
It's definitely live.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.880
You know that you could just plug it in
to see if it works, right?

02:38.880 --> 02:41.840
Yeah, I could, but this is more fun.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.040
Do you know...

02:46.240 --> 02:48.760
I don't know which wanker
English teacher it was

02:48.760 --> 02:52.440
that managed to convince the library
to buy <i>The Wire</i>

02:52.440 --> 02:56.680
as an educational tool for teenage girls,
but I thank them. Mmm.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.400
Where'd you get those?

03:10.400 --> 03:11.880
Garrity's desk.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.200
Fucker sure had his favourites.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.480
Yeah. I'm sorry no one ever saw
any potential in you, Phoebe,

03:18.480 --> 03:19.560
but are we done here?

03:19.560 --> 03:20.720
That depends, Sas.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.480
Is Sandy still dead?

03:24.280 --> 03:25.560
I hope not.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.440
'Cause 44 days and counting,

03:30.440 --> 03:32.240
I'd say she's, like, super dead.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.160
You know who else is super dead?

03:35.960 --> 03:38.320
Stringer Bell, in season three.
Happy viewing.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.640
Fuck, Sas! No! You...

03:41.720 --> 03:43.920
Not Stringer Bell. Fucking hell!

04:05.960 --> 04:06.920
Oh, my God...

04:07.600 --> 04:08.840
Are you all right?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.560
Administering her medical flap.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.000
Still alive.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.560
Ripped off.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.360
Oh, man.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.680
Okay, Unmemorable Lauren is fine.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.760
Get back on your bikes.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.920
Is she kidding?

04:26.920 --> 04:28.040
Come on.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.440
- Saskia, you can't be serious.
- Or do you want to be stuck here forever?

04:31.440 --> 04:33.560
Because that's what'll happen
if we don't send out a radio signal

04:33.560 --> 04:34.920
every single day.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.520
No riding, no radio, no rescue.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.760
-  But...
- Back on your bikes!

04:42.160 --> 04:44.360
Okay. This is dangerous now, Saskia.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.760
We are killing ourselves
charging batteries, and for what?

04:48.760 --> 04:52.640
So we can crowd around one laptop
and watch season four of <i>7th Heaven?</i>

04:54.600 --> 04:57.120
That's the season where the blond brother
with the big eyebrows gets hot.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.320
Okay, okay. Simon's off limits.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.880
But, Saskia, we don't need
to waste literal energy

05:02.880 --> 05:05.360
with the straighteners
and the curling thingos.

05:05.360 --> 05:10.240
Radio signals and protein and rest
should be our priorities.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.360
Having a neat head of hair

05:12.360 --> 05:14.920
is the equivalent of working from home
and making your bed every day.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.000
It sets a standard.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.040
What about this fucking standard?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.920
She's breathing, isn't she?

05:21.800 --> 05:25.680
You know, for someone who dedicated
their life to menstrual equity,

05:25.680 --> 05:28.080
your internalised misogyny is showing,

05:28.760 --> 05:29.680
girl boss.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.840
-  Ooh!
-  Burn.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.160
Oh, I don't hate women, Pepé.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.040
I just hate you.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.960
And the next time I see you,

05:42.960 --> 05:46.480
there will not be a single strand of hair
out of place on your head.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.800
Do we understand each other?

05:50.880 --> 05:51.960
Now pick her up.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.760
Okay, guys, what do we say?

05:56.760 --> 05:58.040
Ride or die!

05:58.040 --> 05:59.720
Ride or die.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.320
Ride or...

06:02.120 --> 06:03.680
Die.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.200
Die!

06:08.280 --> 06:11.000
<i>There is a part
of my head that's like,</i>

06:11.000 --> 06:12.960
so you just watched a woman collapse,

06:13.680 --> 06:14.880
and you felt nothing.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.680
And that's not normal, you should feel...

06:21.320 --> 06:24.160
awful, crippled with guilt, like...

06:27.200 --> 06:30.880
But then I can also
hear his voice in my ear,

06:32.280 --> 06:33.440
and he's...

06:34.840 --> 06:38.520
He's saying, "No, actually,
you made the right call.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.680
If you stop riding,
then you stop surviving."

06:43.320 --> 06:44.240
And...

06:45.800 --> 06:48.800
<i>I mean, I've heard him
like that for years.</i>

06:49.360 --> 06:51.360
Like when Blue Bloods first IPO'd,

06:51.360 --> 06:54.240
the first thing I thought was
"Oh, my God, Ryan..."

06:59.960 --> 07:02.200
"Ryan would be so proud of me."

07:04.680 --> 07:07.520
And I don't really know what to do
with that because I don't...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.840
I guess I don't understand how...

07:11.880 --> 07:14.560
the person who fucked you up so badly,

07:15.480 --> 07:19.160
um, could also be the voice
of encouragement that you need to go on.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.280
You know?

07:23.280 --> 07:25.320
Sorry, it's embarrassing.
I thought I'd figured this all out

07:25.320 --> 07:29.000
with my actual therapist years ago,
but clearly not.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.320
Hey, Sas?

07:33.240 --> 07:35.400
This room was fucking filthy.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.880
Oh, my goodness,
you are busy with something.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.800
- I'll come back.
- No, I'm not.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.760
Sas, you're mopping the carpet.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.160
What do you want, Teresa?

07:47.160 --> 07:49.800
I just wanted to check on you,
see how you're feeling

07:49.800 --> 07:52.320
because, you know,
you went pretty hard on Pepé earlier.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.000
And?

07:55.720 --> 07:57.480
And, um...

07:58.800 --> 08:00.440
I don't know, maybe she's right.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.360
We have been riding really hard
and we're not eating enough to sustain it.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.800
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.320
Because she's not wrong.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.680
- We do need protein.
- Yeah.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.440
And you're the one
who's in charge of the food.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.560
So, where the fuck is it?

08:20.440 --> 08:21.800
Yeah.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.840
You're right.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I'll get on that.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.040
Sas, you know that
you can talk to me, right?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.040
About anything.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.400
I just did, so...

08:48.480 --> 08:49.880
- I'm so sorry.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.000
Phoebs, could we get some lay-by?

08:55.400 --> 08:57.360
Our jelly legs need some credit.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.840
- Ah, thank God.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.960
Hey, Renee, can you, um...

09:16.880 --> 09:18.080
Can you find out what she's doing?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.960
Can't you just talk
to each other already?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.520
Uh, no, that's not how fights work, Renee.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.640
Can you at least just, like, suss out
what she needs all the batteries for?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.520
Powering a freaking jet ski or something?

09:27.640 --> 09:29.120
I just, I don't think
it's any of my business.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.480
You're right, Renee. It's not.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.080
And can you please inform Zoe
that it's none of hers either?

09:33.080 --> 09:35.760
- Amelia says that it's none of your...
- Renee, can you please tell Amelia

09:35.760 --> 09:39.880
that, as SRC rep, the welfare of
the entire class is in fact my business?

09:40.240 --> 09:42.480
- Um, yep, sure. Uh...
-  Renee,

09:42.480 --> 09:46.160
please tell Zoe to move on already
and find someone else to obsess over.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.520
- Yep.
- Move on? Don't flatter yourself, mate.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.480
I've got options galore.
Oi, Fuzzy Laura, wanna bond?

09:54.400 --> 09:56.440
No, I'm good.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.200
Renee, can you please tell Amelia

09:58.200 --> 10:00.600
that Forgettable Laura
doesn't count, obviously?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.520
She...

10:03.360 --> 10:05.360
Real friggin' mature, guys.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.720
-  Sudafed?
-  Mm-mm.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.880
- Cough syrup?
-  No.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.040
Nutmeg?

10:12.040 --> 10:13.040
- No.
- What?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.880
- Not even nutmeg?
-  Not even nutmeg.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.880
Um, the only thing that I have
that might fuck you up

10:19.880 --> 10:23.160
is Prolexoft or the contraceptive pill.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.760
Fine. Happy pills, it is.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.520
Whoa, whoa, hey, um, just so you know,

10:29.840 --> 10:32.080
antidepressants won't get you high.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.440
Yeah, it takes weeks for Prolexoft
to alter your brain chemistry.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.640
- Apparently.
- We're not fucking amateurs.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.520
Yeah. Obviously, we're going to cut it
with some bath cleaner,

10:41.960 --> 10:44.360
maybe a splash of dandruff shampoo,

10:44.760 --> 10:47.440
a dollop of craft adhesive
for good measure and...

10:47.440 --> 10:48.400
Bam!

10:48.880 --> 10:50.280
A Pocko loco, baby.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.760
Sick.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.720
Or how about we...

10:53.720 --> 10:55.880
Or how about you just get over yourself

10:55.880 --> 10:58.000
and make up with Zoe,
so you don't need antidepressants.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.760
- Yeah, that's not how depression works.
-  Oh, hurry up.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.920
Time is batteries, people.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.520
Megan, Megan,

11:04.520 --> 11:07.040
who lent you that hoodie when Kim Shiner
put a chocolate Paddle Pop on your chair

11:07.040 --> 11:08.480
- and you look like you shat yourself?
- This bitch.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.680
- How could you bring that up right now?
- Yeah.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.080
After all these years,
you're going to cash it now?

11:16.960 --> 11:18.400
Fine.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.520
Risk the blood clots
and take the old boring pill.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.160
- Thank you for your custom.
- Junkie.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.760
-  Prolexoft.
- It's three batts a box now.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.840
- Wait, what? Why?
- You saw them. Supply and demand, baby.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.560
Come on, Phoebe.
You can't just up the price.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.360
Yes, I can.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.920
It's all in the game, yeah.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.160
<i>♪ It's all in the game
It's all in the game ♪</i>

11:44.160 --> 11:47.480
Get out, get out, get... Next!

11:53.120 --> 11:54.760
Tin bickies, what you doing?

11:54.760 --> 11:57.440
Holy snapping duck shit!

11:57.440 --> 11:59.720
What happened to your money-maker, mate?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.200
I, uh... I lost a fight with a possum
on the roof, trying to get dinner,

12:03.200 --> 12:05.160
so now I'm onto seafood.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.120
I never thought I'd get used to this view,
but here we are.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.600
I know this is silly, but I still think
we're going to get rescued.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.880
If we're here,
surely there's got to be others.

12:23.480 --> 12:27.360
Fuck, yeah. We're not even
on the highest point of Australia,

12:27.360 --> 12:28.840
let alone the world.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.440
I'm sure Venice is probably fucked,
but Brisbane? Nah!

12:32.440 --> 12:33.800
Mark my words, tea towel.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.240
The Brown Snake is still slithering on.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.200
You know, you don't have to keep saying
that just because my embryos are there.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.760
And Mitch! Shit. I keep forgetting.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.800
This is nice.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.040
How come we've never
hung out like this before?

12:55.160 --> 12:57.120
Saskia!

12:58.720 --> 13:00.360
I'm worried about her, Zo.

13:01.960 --> 13:02.800
Ah.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.560
You stumbled upon the therapist?

13:04.560 --> 13:06.080
Oh, my God, is that what that was?

13:06.080 --> 13:09.240
Yep. Walked in on that shit
a couple of weeks ago.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.920
She was pretending to do
karaoke into the mop.

13:12.760 --> 13:13.960
"Runaway" by The Corrs.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.080
Hmm.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.360
I hate to agree with Genevieve,
but she's right.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.560
Saskia's priorities are all out of whack.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.200
- My turn next?
- Mmm.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.640
What is the deal with Amelia?

13:28.640 --> 13:33.000
I mean, what the fuck is she
charging all those batteries for?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.680
Whoa! Oh!

13:35.080 --> 13:37.640
Motherfishcakes!

13:40.640 --> 13:42.920
- No way!
- We caught a fish.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.000
We caught a fish.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.880
Wild-caught fish with a Vegemite glaze.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.440
- Come on!

13:51.440 --> 13:54.320
Martha Stewart ain't got nothing
on our Teresa May.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.280
She hunts, she gathers, she glazes.

13:57.280 --> 14:01.520
She's going to make that possum her bitch,
eventually, aren't ya?

14:01.520 --> 14:03.400
It's Teddy Bear Grylls, everyone.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.200
Well done, Teresa.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.440
Everybody, dig in.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.440
You deserve it.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.360
Deserve what? Salmonella?

14:12.360 --> 14:15.000
Thirsty, chill.
That clearly ain't a salmon.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.920
'Cause salmonella!

14:28.800 --> 14:30.480
Ooh, yes.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.880
It feels so good.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.520
Well, it looks like shit. Can I have that?

14:37.440 --> 14:40.800
Thank you.
Protein was actually Pepé's idea, guys.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.120
So I think it's only fair she gets
the most nutrient-dense meat, don't you?

14:44.120 --> 14:45.560
Can you serve her up the eyeballs, please?

14:46.520 --> 14:49.600
- Saskia, you can't be serious.
- Do you want to eat the butthole?

14:57.520 --> 15:00.320
Two eyeballs...

15:01.680 --> 15:04.560
with a Vegemite glaze.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
You have a choice.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.720
Go and fix your hair,

15:10.320 --> 15:11.560
or eat the eyeballs.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.840
Mmm.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.800
Tastes like salty grapes.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.160
Mmm.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.440
Mmm.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.880
I enjoyed that so much.
I think I'll have another one.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.920
Oh!

15:49.880 --> 15:52.040
- Oh, my God!
-  Oh, someone help her.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.760
- Renee!

15:53.760 --> 15:56.520
- Do something! Help her, Renee!
- Just do something!

15:57.200 --> 15:58.920
Oh! Ew, ew!

16:26.800 --> 16:29.040
You know you're not meant
to be here this late. Go.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.240
Yeah, because in the
activewearian free market economic model,

16:33.880 --> 16:37.440
post-industrial survival of the fittest
totally self-regulates.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.160
No! What are you...

16:41.840 --> 16:42.920
I said go.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.560
Looking tired there, Sas.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.480
- Whoa. She's live.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.920
It's a filthy fucking habit, Phoebe.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.200
You know, Lucinda hated smoking, too.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.080
Who?

17:24.200 --> 17:27.160
Real pretty young little thing,
used to intern at my work.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.400
Yeah, she hated smoking.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.280
She couldn't even be near it.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.800
She graduated from Ridge Heights
three years ago.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.160
Poor little thing.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.080
She was so fucking taken in by Garrity,

17:40.400 --> 17:43.640
she got his name tattooed on her rib cage.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.280
Just "Ryan,"

17:47.000 --> 17:48.720
in cursive, right here.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.400
Apparently they only lasted six months
after she graduated

17:53.400 --> 17:54.520
before the wife found out.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.000
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Yeah.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.200
Thank you for asking, by the way.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.080
Making the coolest girl in school
realise that she's not fucking special?

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
Yeah, I enjoy it.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.720
Thanks for the battery.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.640
Six months? I just...

18:25.560 --> 18:29.560
He picked me up from Schoolies, and then,
three weeks later, he was done with me.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.920
I've spent years working on this shit.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.040
And now I'm jealous.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.520
- Bike strike, bitch.
- What?

19:08.520 --> 19:10.240
Until the hair shit goes,

19:11.000 --> 19:11.920
I'm not riding.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.480
Fine.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.400
We don't need you.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.880
Do you hear me?

19:23.760 --> 19:26.480
You could choose to do nothing,
and that would be fine.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.400
This class is going to be okay.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.760
You will be shocked to realise
how inconsequential you really are.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.160
But I'm not going to ask you again.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.240
If you're not going to ride,
then you don't get to be a part of this.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.200
Mean Girl 101, folks.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.240
"You can't sit with us."

19:45.720 --> 19:46.760
You can't.

19:47.440 --> 19:51.400
No batteries, no food,
no bunk, no hot water.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.560
You can shelter in a long-drop,

19:54.560 --> 19:56.440
but other than that, you're on your own.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.800
Sas, come on. That's too far.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.320
Ooh!

20:00.560 --> 20:02.920
Detention, Pocko-style.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.040
What are you going to do, Saskia? Make me?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040
No.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.960
But they will.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.080
Because if you don't go
to a long-drop right now,

20:13.200 --> 20:15.200
no one gets
their batteries tonight.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.760
- What?
- Come on, Sas.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.320
It's my turn with the electric toothbrush.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.800
Genevieve, please, just ride okay?

20:23.080 --> 20:24.960
Or go, or go wash your hair, I don't care.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.800
But the rest of us are counting
on these batteries.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.080
Come find me at the shitters
when you're all done being cowards.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.800
<i>Viva la</i> bike strike!

20:52.080 --> 20:54.400
Sas, come on...

20:54.960 --> 20:57.760
Pepé's a pain in the ass,
but you can't banish her.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.560
And she's kind of got a point.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.720
I mean, we could maybe
ride a little bit less

21:01.720 --> 21:04.320
and do our hair
every other day, right, guys?

21:07.080 --> 21:09.280
I'd like that.
This is very high maintenance.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.080
Do you agree?

21:11.960 --> 21:13.760
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.760
- Because of everyone's little outburst...
- What are you doing?

21:16.760 --> 21:18.640
You don't get to cash in that battery
either way.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.760
Saskia, that is not fair.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.440
Don't fucking forget
that I built all of this, okay?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.240
If you want to sit in the dark...

21:25.240 --> 21:26.400
- No, no, no, no!
- ...and shit in the woods

21:26.400 --> 21:28.760
like a bunch of fucking pigs, be my guest.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.440
But if all you're gonna do is sit around
and bitch about how good we have it,

21:31.440 --> 21:33.080
I'm done fucking around!

21:40.200 --> 21:43.920
We need to get out of here
before Sas goes full Jonestown, so...

21:44.760 --> 21:46.080
Ta-dah!

21:46.080 --> 21:48.680
You're going back to Brisvegas,
T-intersection.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.320
What is it?

21:50.320 --> 21:51.800
Um, it's a boat.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.920
- Right.
- It's your boat.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.120
All she needs now is a mast, matey.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.280
You were always a shocker for regifting,
Zo-Zo.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.440
- Oh, no...
- Oh! No, no, no, it's fine.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.080
I love it. Thank you. It's great.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.880
Good. You deserve it.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.400
Unlike Amelia.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.640
I mean, apparently,

22:11.640 --> 22:15.120
when you declare
that you're BFFs for life...

22:15.680 --> 22:17.400
...all it really means is, like,

22:17.400 --> 22:20.280
"Well, maybe I'll like your Insta pics
every two years or so."

22:20.280 --> 22:22.240
Know what I mean?

22:22.240 --> 22:26.560
Anyway, even if I wanted to make up
with her at this point,

22:26.560 --> 22:30.000
she's too busy
charging her fucking batteries

22:30.000 --> 22:32.440
to power her gigantic vibrator?

22:32.440 --> 22:36.120
Like, honestly, that's, it's the only
explanation there could possibly be.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.600
Yeah, um, look, Zo...

22:40.160 --> 22:43.200
Every night at dinner,
I see Amelia take a little pill.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.800
Megan and Tegan have been going on and on

22:45.800 --> 22:48.840
about not being able
to get happy pills all day.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.960
Okay, so...

22:51.880 --> 22:54.640
I think Amelia's on antidepressants.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.320
Wait, what?

23:00.280 --> 23:04.640
Fuck!

23:05.720 --> 23:06.880
Ew.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.440
It's bad. It's bad. It's bad.
It's bad, isn't it? It's bad.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.080
It's okay, T. It's just a bruised nail.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.920
But it is going to need surgery, okay?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.440
Uh, this isn't dinner and a show.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.520
Get out of here!

23:20.920 --> 23:21.920
Go!

23:25.600 --> 23:26.720
Hey.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.880
I am not going to leave your side,
tea cozy.

23:28.880 --> 23:29.960
Don't you worry about that.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.040
No, no. You should definitely go.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.840
And you should make up with Amelia before
you take someone's eye out or something.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.080
Oh. Okay. Yeah, for sure.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.800
Oh, shit, sorry.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.360
Sorry, no, I just mean...

23:46.560 --> 23:49.920
You know, you can't just expect
to replace her.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.080
Yep.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.120
- You can go.
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.200
Renee, you have to stay.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.120
You too, Phoebe.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.480
Duh! M.D. coming at you.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.800
- What?
- What have we got painkiller wise?

24:11.560 --> 24:12.840
Not much.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.960
Just use whatever you need to
to make it as painless as possible, okay?

24:17.600 --> 24:19.040
Renee, have you got this?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.520
Yeah, [scoffs] sure.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.760
Yeah, of course I do.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.360
Actually, no different to when I worked
for Médecins Sans Frontières.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.240
- It's the same, exact same conditions.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.400
You know?

24:30.680 --> 24:33.120
How many times I gotta tell you, Phoebe?
It's a filthy fucking habit.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
-  Wait. So are we...
- Just take it off.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.120
<i>You're different
to the other girls, Saskia.</i>

24:43.640 --> 24:44.720
Mature.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.600
Don't hate me when I tell you...

24:48.240 --> 24:50.320
I'm going to have to mark you down
on your essay.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.400
- But...
- I know, I know, it's shitty.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.600
We can't have people thinking
that I'm playing favourites.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.800
Even if you are my favourite.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.960
You understand that, don't you?

25:14.600 --> 25:15.880
Fuck!

25:21.560 --> 25:22.920
That's three batteries.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.000
Prolexoft.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.760
Um, you're going to need
two more batteries for that.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.440
- What?
- Inflation due to medical emergencies.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.600
I need those pills, Phoebe.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.560
That is the only thing stopping me
from hurling myself into the sinkhole.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.920
It's Pocko, babe. Everyone's depressed.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.920
Yep, she's out. Go for it, mate.

25:45.880 --> 25:46.920
Okay.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.200
Um...

25:50.880 --> 25:52.160
Maybe...

25:52.600 --> 25:53.920
Just count me in.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.920
No worries.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.160
All right, one, two, three.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.880
Weren't we just gonna
take the nail off?

26:10.680 --> 26:13.200
Sas said, "Take it off."

26:17.320 --> 26:20.200
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Fuck me.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.120
I didn't mean to lie!

26:21.120 --> 26:24.520
It just came out at the reunion.
Everyone was just so fucking accomplished.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.200
And Sandy! Oh, Sandy, when I told her
I was a nail technician,

26:27.200 --> 26:30.720
she patted me on the head
and I just, I felt so totally inferior.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.840
And I'm just, it just slipped out.
I said, "Oh, I'm a doctor," okay?

26:33.840 --> 26:36.000
And, you know what, it felt really good.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.360
But then the Pocko came,

26:37.360 --> 26:39.640
and everyone was like,
"Thank fuck we've got a doctor."

26:39.640 --> 26:40.880
What was I gonna do then?

26:40.880 --> 26:43.480
Tell them they're going to die
because they don't have...

26:43.480 --> 26:45.320
It's clear you're not a doctor!

26:45.320 --> 26:48.040
But I haven't got any time
for your impostor bullshit.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.080
There's a toe bleeding the fuck out.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.240
All right? So right now,
I need you to shut up

26:52.240 --> 26:54.920
and burn shit out of this
so you can use it to cauterise that toe

26:54.920 --> 26:56.160
until it smells like teppanyaki.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.960
Mmm. Who's cooking a steak?

27:12.280 --> 27:13.200
Hi, Teresa.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.200
The surgery went very well.

27:17.880 --> 27:22.080
The large left-foot phalange was removed

27:22.800 --> 27:24.320
without any complications.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.240
There may be a bit of residual pain,

27:26.240 --> 27:28.240
- but other than that...
- I'm sorry, uh...

27:29.120 --> 27:30.880
Did you just say "removed"?

27:30.880 --> 27:32.920
That's correct. Our good doctor here

27:32.920 --> 27:36.720
did exactly what she was instructed
to do by Saskia and took it off.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.800
Uh...

27:38.680 --> 27:41.080
- I'll just...
-  Anyway, we must away.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.960
- That's not...

27:42.960 --> 27:45.280
Oh, my God.
You told them to cut off my toe?

27:45.280 --> 27:47.640
- No, no.
- I thought it was just the nail.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.080
It was. They misunderstood.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.880
Why would you tell them to cut off my toe?

27:50.880 --> 27:53.840
It wasn't even that bad.
They didn't have to cut off the whole toe.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.240
What the hell, Saskia?

27:56.240 --> 27:57.360
Hello?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.200
You know what, Teresa?
I think you might be right.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.040
I think I'm not really coping.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.000
Oh, my God! What? What?

28:04.000 --> 28:08.280
Yeah, it's just that, um,
all of this shit is coming up.

28:08.280 --> 28:12.200
This, like, really fucked-up shit
that happened to me while I was here.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.000
- And I'm kind of just realising now...
- You want to talk now?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.240
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about your foot.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.120
- I really am.
- Oh, why don't you go and talk

28:19.120 --> 28:21.920
to your fake fucking therapist,
you crazy fucking bitch?

28:23.640 --> 28:24.560
Uh-huh.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.520
Dinner's due in an hour, Teresa.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.160
And the women are expecting fish.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.160
So if I were you, I'd chop-chop.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.160
Or should I say, hop-hop?

28:45.120 --> 28:48.400
So, this guy's, like, my favourite,
and he is such a sweetheart

28:48.400 --> 28:50.160
and he is also really clever.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.080
I didn't watch any TV growing up,
so this is like...

28:53.080 --> 28:54.400
Phoebe.

28:55.400 --> 29:00.040
I just cut off a woman's toe.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.480
Yeah.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.840
And you covered for me.

29:05.760 --> 29:06.960
Why?

29:08.320 --> 29:10.600
Because I get it, Renee, you know?

29:11.400 --> 29:14.040
I worked my ass off
to get into this school.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.000
Like, I earned my academic honours.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.360
And it means shit because these girls
still look down on you

29:19.360 --> 29:21.840
if you're not the daughter
of some dickweed CEO.

29:22.440 --> 29:25.560
You know? So, like, you want to tell us
that you're a doctor, then...

29:26.240 --> 29:28.000
fuck them, you're a doctor.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.600
So you got to own it, eh?

29:30.240 --> 29:33.200
Like, in the words of Proposition Joe,
who you'll meet, actually,

29:33.200 --> 29:35.720
um, "You've got to look the part

29:35.720 --> 29:37.680
and be the part, motherfucker."

29:40.240 --> 29:44.040
- What the fucking fuck?
- What kind of crap medicine was that?

29:44.040 --> 29:47.000
- Misinterpret this, you fucking--
-  Get the fuck off her.

29:47.560 --> 29:48.880
And you!

29:48.880 --> 29:51.080
This is what you fucking wanted from me,
isn't it?

29:51.080 --> 29:52.760
Is for me to lose my fucking shit.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.680
Yes. Yes.
Remind you who runs this joint, okay?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.760
So unless you're here
to deliver batteries,

29:57.760 --> 30:00.240
- you better calm the fuck down, Sas!
- I don't give a fuck!

30:00.240 --> 30:02.960
I don't want your fucking
deal any more, Phoebe!

30:02.960 --> 30:06.040
He was still fucking working here.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.680
Doesn't anybody care?

30:14.960 --> 30:16.920
Did you really think I was going to let

30:16.920 --> 30:21.160
some Gordon Gekko scholarship scab
blackmail me forever?

30:21.800 --> 30:23.360
I'm fucking done.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.800
You're all right. You're all right.
You all right?

30:32.800 --> 30:33.800
Mm-hmm.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.600
How many more do you need?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.320
Two.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.520
You can't be <i>demerius.</i>

32:23.080 --> 32:24.280
Bitch gotta get got.
