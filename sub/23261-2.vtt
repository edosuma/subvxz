Someone's done a runner on a body.

03:26.479 --> 03:29.639
Yeah, the victim is... They say
she's hanging in there, but...

03:29.680 --> 03:31.879
Likely to prove fatal. Mm. I've got
you.

03:32.519 --> 03:36.159
Why aren't you up there already? I
had to drop the little 'un off.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.680
I'm sorry. I got here as quick as I
could.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.839
Kenny's up there. Mm. I know that
road.

03:42.879 --> 03:46.319
It's all bloody boy racers bombing it
along at 80mph.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.239
Was she conscious when they found
her? No.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.400
(BEEPING)

04:07.280 --> 04:10.439
Can't feel a pulse. She's in cardiac
arrest. All right. Clear.

04:15.759 --> 04:18.479
So it was before dawn, they reckon?
We don't know.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.239
We haven't got a name either.
Paramedics took her bag. We're on
it.

04:23.439 --> 04:25.439
And there's no passenger.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.800
Is the cab firm aware - Everitt's?

04:30.360 --> 04:32.959
It's answerphone. Jac's up there
waiting now.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.319
What? She volunteered. She's good,
Aiden. Don't waste her.

04:39.959 --> 04:42.839
Anyway, she was definitely hit by
another vehicle.

04:42.879 --> 04:45.200
She didn't just skid off the road.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.920
(SIGHS) What a mess.

04:51.479 --> 04:53.479
Now, there's two types of paint.

04:54.159 --> 04:56.159
Two sets of tyre tracks.

04:56.639 --> 04:58.639
I think they both came this way.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.680
Clipped her...and off she went.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.119
But it's not like it's a blind bend
or anything, is it?

05:10.159 --> 05:13.479
Even in the night. High speed
wouldn't make a difference.

05:13.519 --> 05:16.200
Right, well, there's culpability
right there.

05:16.239 --> 05:19.039
These tyre tracks say speeding to
you?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.920
Well, could've been drunk.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.959
Yeah. It's likely, isn't it?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
Drink or drugs.

05:29.839 --> 05:33.000
But there's plenty room to swerve,
isn't there?

05:33.839 --> 05:35.839
Loads of room.

05:38.239 --> 05:40.239
So, was this deliberate?

05:56.879 --> 05:58.879
What have you got for us?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.759
That could be it, right there.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.079
Can you work your magic on that, Ken,
see if she was texting?

06:07.119 --> 06:09.119
Well, I know a man who can, yes.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.920
Have you clocked the diesel? Aye.

06:11.959 --> 06:15.280
Well, she's in the ditch, so it's not
from her vehicle, is it?

06:15.319 --> 06:17.319
No, agricultural.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.759
More than likely some sort of farm
vehicle.

06:20.239 --> 06:22.439
Well, see how far this diesel goes,
Ken.

06:22.479 --> 06:25.759
You never know. It might take us
right to her front door. Hm.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.039
Was there any alcohol in the blood?

06:51.079 --> 06:53.759
I don't know. I hope not.

06:54.639 --> 06:56.639
She was 16 weeks pregnant.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.600
No, no, there's no foetal heartbeat.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
How long do you keep her like that?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.400
Till all the relatives have been
informed.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.639
Faye, she's called.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.360
We found this on the cab firm's
website.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.680
Thanks.

07:19.119 --> 07:21.119
Has she ever been in before?

07:21.839 --> 07:24.239
Yes. But 'next of kin' was blank.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.360
Oh, so do you know who the baby's dad
is? We don't have antenatal records.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.439
So, what was she in for before?

07:32.479 --> 07:34.600
I don't think I can tell you that,
can I?

07:35.560 --> 07:37.560
Isn't your deputy talking to legal?

07:39.839 --> 07:43.560

order before anything's disclosed.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.600
Oh, very helpful. What happened to
999 solidarity?

07:47.639 --> 07:49.879
Hey, Kenny, you got a relative for
me?

07:49.920 --> 07:52.600
No, but we've found an address
marked 'home'.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.200
It was stored in the sat-nav. Ah,
right.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.479
Now, why didn't you think of that?
Why didn't you?

07:58.519 --> 08:03.239
Well, make sure you pass anything
useful on to these medics, update
their records.

Wakeland?

Yeah, but she's not in. Ah, we know
that, pet.

09:12.839 --> 09:15.200
But this is her address, right?

09:15.239 --> 09:17.600
Yeah, she rents with my brother.

afraid we've got some bad news.

from work.

Er, DCI Stanhope.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.680
It's regarding your tenant - Faye
Wakeland.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.720
Well, that doesn't sound good.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.319
Mm. Can we...

09:56.200 --> 10:00.079
There's no chance? Not even like...
No, the medics think not.

10:00.119 --> 10:02.119
I'm sorry.

10:02.839 --> 10:05.920
Well, what about the baby? Is the
baby alive?

10:05.959 --> 10:08.600
(SIGHS) It won't be, love. Think
about it.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.720
How long's she been a tenant here?

10:12.759 --> 10:15.200
Oh, about 18 months.

10:16.039 --> 10:18.039
Yeah, about 18 months.

10:18.079 --> 10:21.680
Do her family know? We were hoping
you could help us contact them.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.959
We didn't meet 'em. They don't get
on, I think.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
No, they don't get on.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.200
So do they go under the name of
Wakeland?

10:32.119 --> 10:34.560
Again, I...I don't really know.

10:35.319 --> 10:39.119
Is there anything you can think of
that might help us to contact them?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.959
They live in, like, a stately home.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.600
(SIGHS) Well, that's what she told
me. No, they don't.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.720
You could try her room. She might
have an address book or something.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.159
It's er...just up there on the left.

11:08.759 --> 11:11.479
She was at the funeral. She was
definitely there.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.280
I mean, she was fine.

11:14.319 --> 11:17.879
I mean, she wasn't fine considering
there was a funeral, like. Mm.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.600
Was that the last time you spoke to
her? Yeah. She didn't come home.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.639
Did she meet someone?

11:23.680 --> 11:26.879

be in character?

Well, not really, no.

It was er...our cousin. Roddy.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.479
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:40.239 --> 11:42.560
Coming so soon after. It beggars
belief.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.560
So, was she close to the deceased?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Roddy...? Maplin.

11:49.039 --> 11:51.639
Ah, no, she only knew him through
us.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.600
She was my rock.

11:54.639 --> 11:58.479
That's what I called her. Simone,
would you shut up a bit? Sorry.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.879
Do you know who the baby's father
was?

12:10.759 --> 12:13.079
I didn't ask. She didn't know.

12:17.239 --> 12:19.439
Ah, it's all right, pet. I don't
judge.

12:21.479 --> 12:25.360
Funny question, but can you think of
anyone who might want to harm her?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
What, like, deliberately?

12:29.839 --> 12:32.519
No. Not round here, no.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.439
What about the fellas she used to
hang out with in town and stuff?

12:37.479 --> 12:39.479
Maybe. I don't know.

12:39.519 --> 12:42.400
She said she hung around with some
rough fellas in the past,

12:42.439 --> 12:44.439
but nothing that we were aware of.

12:44.479 --> 12:46.079
Hm.

12:46.680 --> 12:50.159
She had a couple of photo albums in
the lounge. Would they help?

12:50.200 --> 12:51.800
Aye.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.159
If anything occurs to you...

13:15.879 --> 13:17.879
..you call this number.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.920
Can we see her on the ward?

13:19.959 --> 13:23.239
Er, probably not, until her next of
kin have been informed.

13:24.079 --> 13:27.319
So, unless you're family or
a partner...

13:28.800 --> 13:32.639
Right, well, um, we'll head down
there and we'll see what they say.

13:42.439 --> 13:44.439
Her landlord, my arse.

13:44.479 --> 13:46.759
Do a background check on the pair of
them.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.039
Well, to be fair, could be any reason
he's lying.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.680
Like what? Benefit fraud for one.

flags up.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.560
You all right? Any progress?

14:02.600 --> 14:06.479
Nope. I've tried the mobiles, the
landlines. I've instant messaged.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.400
It's fine. I'll just wait.
Are you sure?

14:09.439 --> 14:13.200
At least you've got the weather for
it. Oh, yeah. This job's like a
holiday.

14:13.239 --> 14:16.920
Anyone reported her missing or the
vehicle? Doesn't look like it.

14:18.479 --> 14:21.879
Likely to prove fatal. And by likely
they're saying definite,

14:21.920 --> 14:23.920
so no-one gets their hopes up.

14:24.839 --> 14:28.639
Shame. Did she have kids? Nah. But
she was pregnant.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.759
Wish I hadn't asked. Aye.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.759
Now, it's unclear the sequence of
events leading up to the collision,

14:34.800 --> 14:37.119
but the other vehicle left the scene.
Why?

14:37.159 --> 14:39.680
Under the influence? Probably.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.200
So follow up any road-rage incidents
in the area.

14:43.239 --> 14:45.959
Did she have a run-in up the road?
Did anyone else?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.280
Was it random or was someone going
after her?

14:48.319 --> 14:50.319
That was my next question, Mark.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.200
Where are we with the diesel? Half a
mile down the road.

14:53.239 --> 14:57.639
The CSOs reckon there was a gap
between the tread. So a 4X4.
Off-roader?

14:57.680 --> 14:59.680
That or a van, yeah. Tractor, maybe.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.600
Hm. Have you got something on that
landlord?

15:02.639 --> 15:04.639
Nope. Him and his sister drew a
blank.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.319
But the victim herself, she was on
the system - as a timewaster.

15:08.360 --> 15:12.519
She presented at Moresby about two
years ago asking for a restraining
order.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.759
Said her stepmum, Susan Wakeland,
was trying to kill her.

15:17.079 --> 15:20.800
You sure about that? Absolutely. She
said she tried to run her over.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.280
How long's this been a nursing home?

15:36.319 --> 15:38.159
Oh, 30-odd years.

for about five.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.959
His wife, Susan, looks after him.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.360
Right. I'll go in and break the news.

And I'm afraid she's not expected to
survive her injuries.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.879
So, what, she's put someone
in a coma?

16:41.039 --> 16:45.119
No. No, I'm sorry if I've not made
myself clear, Mrs Wakeland.

16:45.159 --> 16:48.039
No, it's Faye who's been injured.

maybe? She was working a lot.

I can't say we've had much contact
recently.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.680
I can't do this.

stuff over power of attorney.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.560
Money? (SIGHS) What money?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.879
Faye got bad advice from some
solicitor she was going out with.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.400
He told her to come after Brian's
estate cos I couldn't be trusted.

18:33.439 --> 18:35.959
Mm. But that was resolved?

18:36.720 --> 18:39.159
More or less. Hm.

Now, a tricky one, this.

Faye reported to the police that you
tried to run her over.

18:45.159 --> 18:47.159
Do you wanna tell me about that?

18:47.200 --> 18:49.720
I've absolutely no idea.

18:50.159 --> 18:52.759
An incident in Grey Market about two
years ago.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.400
Well, we had a row, yeah, but I
didn't...

18:57.720 --> 19:01.720
She practically threw herself on the
bonnet. Effing and blinding at me.

19:02.159 --> 19:04.560
She told lies.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.680
Like? Oh, like she was always the
victim

19:08.720 --> 19:10.720
and someone was out to get her.

19:10.759 --> 19:14.280
And was someone out to get her?
(SCOFFS) No.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.319
So, what were the other lies?

19:18.119 --> 19:21.879
Obviously there was stuff that she
said about Brian.

19:22.839 --> 19:25.560
And with the stroke, he could barely
answer back.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.600
So, what did she say exactly?

19:29.239 --> 19:33.839
That he was cruel and that we made
her teenage years a misery.

19:33.879 --> 19:36.239
Well, no, she made her life a
misery.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.200
I'm sorry to say it, but she did.

19:38.239 --> 19:40.439
Um, so how did it happen?

19:40.479 --> 19:43.239
Was she on her phone or...
Don't know, love.

19:44.839 --> 19:46.839
The other driver didn't stop.

19:51.519 --> 19:54.319
Poor Sue. Poor Brian.

19:54.879 --> 19:57.239
This is gonna set him back, no
doubt.

19:59.319 --> 20:01.319
Was she on duty two days ago?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.439
How do you mean? Can you say where
she was?

20:05.039 --> 20:07.039
As in, are you checking up on her?

20:07.079 --> 20:09.680
It's just a routine part of our
investigation.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.159
Between say, 6pm and 6am?

20:12.839 --> 20:15.639
Yeah. Yeah. There was a fire drill
about 8pm.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.159
I'm the marshal. I remember ticking
her off.

20:19.439 --> 20:22.720
Look, the hospital will need to talk
to next of kin.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.239
Formalities, organ donations,
what have you.

20:28.639 --> 20:30.839
I've got no idea of her wishes. I...

20:33.400 --> 20:35.519
What do you expect me to do, ask her
dad?

20:55.239 --> 20:57.239
The nurse reckons she was here.

20:58.319 --> 21:00.879
Well, I don't think she's going to
visit.

21:01.639 --> 21:03.639
Wow. I know.

21:05.280 --> 21:09.280
Well, the hospital are going to want
witnesses when they switch her off.

21:16.039 --> 21:18.039
(MOBILE RINGS)

21:18.360 --> 21:20.039
(RINGING TONE)
AIDEN: Yeah.

21:20.079 --> 21:23.000
They've turned up. Someone from the
workshop next door

21:23.039 --> 21:26.000
told them first thing yesterday and
they closed in respect.

21:26.039 --> 21:28.319
All right, thanks. We're on our way
over.

21:42.319 --> 21:44.319
Popular.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.959
Went out of her way to help people,
especially elderly clients.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.319
I had to have a chat about the
number of free lifts she was giving.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.200
How long was she with you?

21:54.280 --> 21:57.200
Oh, under a year. I can check. Hm.

21:57.959 --> 22:01.079
Had she had any trouble on the road
or with clients?

22:01.119 --> 22:03.200
No. Why?

22:03.239 --> 22:05.400
It was an accident, wasn't it?

22:05.439 --> 22:08.479
Well, we're keeping an open mind for
now, love.

22:10.959 --> 22:15.479
Was she on duty when she died or was
she using the car for a private...

22:15.519 --> 22:19.439
No, she was on duty.
Friday night's our best night.
Someone had to be on.

22:19.479 --> 22:21.800
She'd agreed because she wasn't
drinking.

22:21.839 --> 22:25.759
So I could have a drink at Roddy's
do. Because of the pregnancy?
Probably.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.800
What pregnancy?

22:29.319 --> 22:32.000
What? I only heard on the grapevine.

22:32.959 --> 22:37.119
Do you know who the baby's father
was? No idea. I didn't even know she
had a bloke.

22:37.159 --> 22:39.759
She was always banging on about that
solicitor.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
The one with all the money.

22:43.119 --> 22:45.319
So, just to clarify...

22:46.039 --> 22:49.680
..was she working when she crashed or
was she on her way to work?

22:49.720 --> 22:51.959
I'm guessing, given where she was
found,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.400
she was driving to the address
I gave her. Ah. Have you um...

23:01.800 --> 23:04.280
It's a landline. Usually means
a pensioner.

23:04.959 --> 23:07.079
I can't remember
if it was a man or a lady.

23:07.119 --> 23:10.039
And did they call back to say she
hadn't turned up?

23:10.079 --> 23:12.079
Now you ask, I don't think they did.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.920
Well, thanks, love.

23:26.720 --> 23:31.039
Jac. Apparently she had a boyfriend
who was a solicitor.

23:31.079 --> 23:36.079
See if it's the same one the
stepmother was banging on about.
Went after the father's estate.

23:36.119 --> 23:39.319
Jac, Mark'll have it on the system.
It's all right. I know.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.159
Kenny.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.800
Trace that caller. See if they saw or
heard from her.

23:45.839 --> 23:48.239
Will do, ma'am.
We'll check out the CCTV.

24:01.439 --> 24:04.159
Well, it is a funeral. So crying's to
be expected.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.479
She's not storming out or anything,
is she?

24:06.519 --> 24:09.000
No, just leaving to start her shift,
I'd say.

24:09.039 --> 24:13.079
Packed do though, weren't it? We ran
out of lager, I remember that.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.280
Popular fella then.

24:16.319 --> 24:18.879
Yeah. That or the free bar.

24:20.119 --> 24:22.239
I think the shock upset a lot of
people.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.759
How'd he die? I thought you
investigated.

24:27.079 --> 24:28.959
Roddy took his own life.

24:31.119 --> 24:34.039
I want everything on Roddy Maplin's
background.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.680
His wife, the officers who found his
body, inquest reports, the lot.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.560
Probably still interim. Yeah, well,
interim'll do.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.680
And I want everything on that funeral

24:43.720 --> 24:45.959
and how this place all fits together.

25:00.039 --> 25:03.439
Could it be some satellite
interfering with the GPS?

25:03.479 --> 25:06.000
No. This is what she typed into
the car as well.

25:06.039 --> 25:08.280
No landline for at least a mile and
half.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.280
So, who called her out here?

25:17.319 --> 25:19.319
Do you reckon it was a trap?

25:19.959 --> 25:21.959
Could be premeditated.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.600
(MOBILE RINGS)

25:23.639 --> 25:26.759
Kenny, trace that phone call. Top
priority.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.759
Yes.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.680
Right.

25:37.639 --> 25:39.639
That was the hospital.

25:41.479 --> 25:43.479
They're ready for us.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
This doesn't feel right. I know.

26:03.560 --> 26:08.280
It's all right, you can stand down.
One of our A&E nurses has agreed to
witness.

26:08.319 --> 26:09.759
Ah.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.959
Did you meet her whilst you were on
duty?

26:37.680 --> 26:40.560
Ah, so that's why you concealed your
relationship.

26:41.319 --> 26:43.319
I could have lost my job.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.400
I loved her.

26:45.439 --> 26:47.439
I loved her so much.

26:49.519 --> 26:52.159
Can you tell everyone
I'm next of kin?

26:54.239 --> 26:55.839
Aye.

26:59.759 --> 27:01.439
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

27:17.759 --> 27:20.159
At the time, I was working in mental
health.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.720
She was admitted, said she'd had an
overdose.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.879
When the bloods came back, they were
clear.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.920
She told 'em she'd made it up.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.879
They just told me to inform her GP
and um...

27:32.920 --> 27:35.200
give her a leaflet on mindfulness.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
So let me get this straight.

27:39.119 --> 27:41.839
Rather than see her discharged with
nowhere to go,

27:41.879 --> 27:43.879
you said she could come to yours.

27:44.639 --> 27:46.479
Aye.

27:47.119 --> 27:49.200
Well, she was a fine-looking lass.

27:49.239 --> 27:51.560
No, it wasn't like that. No.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.600
She was in a state. But you were
living as a couple.

27:57.439 --> 27:59.439
It wasn't official.

28:00.639 --> 28:03.639
With the three of us at home, it was
like a little family

28:03.680 --> 28:05.680
with Simone as our kid.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.400
We never said we were, like,
in a relationship.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.759
Noel, was the baby yours?

28:15.319 --> 28:17.079
I just don't know.

28:18.079 --> 28:20.079
So, did that cause ructions?

28:20.119 --> 28:22.039
Was there a fall-out at the funeral?

28:22.079 --> 28:24.400
Is that where this is heading?
Not at all.

28:24.439 --> 28:27.360
Not at all. It was a mess, yes.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.720
But I loved her.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.800
So, who else was she close to, other
than you and Simone?

28:41.920 --> 28:43.680
Everyone.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.720
She had friends all over.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.560
Hm.

28:49.119 --> 28:51.119
She sounds like a nice girl.

28:52.839 --> 28:55.600
Her dad was a nasty piece of work.
And her stepmum.

28:55.639 --> 28:58.839
Hang on. You said you hadn't met
them.

28:59.319 --> 29:01.600
I haven't, but the stories she told
me...

29:02.639 --> 29:04.639
That's why she was vulnerable.

29:08.159 --> 29:11.800
Get them dropped off and have someone
keep an eye on them. What?

29:11.839 --> 29:15.560
So we can check his alibi with the
neighbour before he gives them the
heads-up.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.319
Do you reckon he's lying? I think he
was trying to tell me something.

29:19.439 --> 29:22.159
Now this crash was premeditated.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.200
Mm.

29:24.239 --> 29:27.680
Heat of the moment, I could buy they
had some kind of row.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.560
But...he really loved her.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.680
It's just... I don't know.

29:34.519 --> 29:38.159

that hit her. (SOFTLY) Right.

Aye, we are, love.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.079
Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs Maplin.

30:21.119 --> 30:23.119
We know you've been recently
bereaved.

30:23.159 --> 30:27.319
How does this happen? You know, it's
only three weeks since Roddy.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.680
Well, can we come in, love?

30:43.560 --> 30:46.560
I was out the back of the Walnut
with Noel for most of it.

30:47.200 --> 30:51.400
Couldn't face that lot. Rat-arsed
blokes coming up, shaking my hand.

30:52.280 --> 30:56.200
Can anyone else confirm that? The
manager maybe. He was in and out.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.239
And Simone. She kept bringing us
drinks.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.720
Why do you need my movements?

31:02.759 --> 31:04.639
Love, think about it.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.319
They're double-checking what Noel
told them.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.759
It just doesn't seem real.

31:09.800 --> 31:13.759
I don't know why I'm upset. My dad's
just gone but... No, she was a nice
lady.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.039
She did a lot for Noel and Simone.

31:16.079 --> 31:18.079
Hm? In what way?

31:18.920 --> 31:22.159
Getting Simone on a college course
for her reading and that.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.519
I thought they were in it for the
long haul - her and Noel and the
baby.

31:27.879 --> 31:31.039
Poor bugger had no luck. Was the
baby Noel's then?

31:31.759 --> 31:33.759
Well, whose else would it be?

31:34.759 --> 31:37.200
I know she played hard to get, but
she doted on him.

31:40.479 --> 31:44.119
Now this solicitor, Adil Dohni, he's
a former boyfriend

31:44.159 --> 31:46.159
and he represented her in court.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.479
Fancy offices. Mm.

31:53.759 --> 31:57.839
My dad always said, 'You ever need a
lawyer, get one who's made a bob or
two.'

31:57.879 --> 32:03.039
This particular one's been sued
twice for professional negligence.
Right, so he's a shyster.

32:03.079 --> 32:05.959
They were together at least five
years, I'd say. Mm.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.079
Did we get anything on the legal
case?

32:08.119 --> 32:11.439
Looks like it went in her favour.
Faye ended up with the family home.

32:11.479 --> 32:15.000
Hang on. If she's got a house, what's
she doing living with Noel?

32:15.039 --> 32:16.920
It was sold two years ago.

32:18.959 --> 32:22.519
And six months later she's in A&E
saying she's homeless?

32:23.600 --> 32:25.600
So where'd the money go?

32:26.519 --> 32:28.000
Hm?

32:39.200 --> 32:41.079
I just wish I'd seen her.

32:41.839 --> 32:45.879
I tried, but she kept saying to me
that she was...snowed under.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.920
So, when was the last time?

32:47.959 --> 32:51.560
18 months? When we split up,
I guess.

32:52.439 --> 32:54.439
Can I ask why did you split up?

32:55.039 --> 32:57.039
Just the normal.

32:57.519 --> 32:59.519
Just...stopped getting along.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.600
Mm. Ah, we know you were helping her
out in a case.

33:03.639 --> 33:06.639
I mean, did you fall out over that?
No. It wasn't money.

33:09.319 --> 33:11.319
I got frustrated.

33:12.319 --> 33:15.319
Getting the house could've sorted
her out financially.

33:17.319 --> 33:20.280
Cut a long story short, she sold up

33:20.319 --> 33:23.079
and, well, blew the lot.

33:23.119 --> 33:24.920
What, like, two hundred grand?

33:25.639 --> 33:28.119
Nearly, yeah. It was all a bit
manic, really.

33:28.159 --> 33:30.119
Kind of like a...a meltdown.

33:30.959 --> 33:33.280
Mm. So was it that drove you apart?

33:33.319 --> 33:38.039
Kids. She didn't want them and,
well, I did.

33:38.079 --> 33:41.039
Ah, well, yeah, well, that can be
difficult.

33:44.079 --> 33:46.959
Basically her dad and stepmum were
horrible to her.

33:49.800 --> 33:53.680
Did she ever talk about violence in
her childhood?

33:53.720 --> 33:56.519
Some. But more...psychological.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.519
Nasty stuff like no birthday
presents,

33:59.560 --> 34:02.759
locking her in her room... Yeah, but
did she tell you that?

34:02.800 --> 34:07.039
It was obvious from the moment you
met them. Brian was a nasty piece of
work.

34:07.079 --> 34:10.879
If we'd not gone after the house,
Sue would've left her with nothing.

34:13.879 --> 34:17.519
Did she ever speak of anyone maybe
wanting to harm her?

34:18.280 --> 34:20.039
Oh, yeah.

34:20.079 --> 34:22.079
Susan was always making threats.

34:22.119 --> 34:25.039
Now, did she tell you that or did you
witness it?

34:25.079 --> 34:28.800
Oh, I witnessed it. Susan was like
a stalker whenever she got angry.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.600
She waited outside my flat once.

34:32.680 --> 34:34.680
When we arrived there was a big row.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.119
Tried to run Faye over.

34:49.519 --> 34:52.319
I told the other bloke. There was
a fire drill. She was here.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.439
Did you see her in the early evening?

34:56.479 --> 34:58.800
I'm sure I must have. So you didn't.

34:59.959 --> 35:01.959
Did you mislead my sergeant?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
No, I just... I know she was here.

35:04.639 --> 35:06.959
Did she ask you to lie for her? I'm
not lying.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.079
I just... I know she wasn't
involved.

35:09.119 --> 35:12.400
How do you know that? Faye was always
getting into trouble.

35:12.439 --> 35:15.439
Slagging her off, playing the
victim. It was completely unfair.

35:15.479 --> 35:19.079
I'm just trying to stop you wasting
your time. Where is she, love?

35:19.119 --> 35:22.839
She went on respite leave to her
sister's, just after she heard
the news.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.439
She left just after we came to see
her.

35:34.479 --> 35:38.079
But there's a sister, apparently.
She reckons she's gone there.

35:38.119 --> 35:42.519
Now we need to find her. I'll get
upstairs to throw tactical at it,
if necessary.

35:42.560 --> 35:46.600
Upstairs have just agreed to the
sniffer dogs for the fuel. Finally!

35:47.519 --> 35:50.159
Now, get uniform to bring in
Mrs Minibreak,

35:50.200 --> 35:52.200
while we track down this van.

36:03.319 --> 36:05.439
Follow the tree line all the way
along.

36:05.479 --> 36:07.479
Will do, sarge.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.079
Nothing yet.

36:22.759 --> 36:24.959
He's lost that spot already.
Nothing?

36:26.439 --> 36:28.600
The dogs have lost the scent of the
diesel.

36:28.639 --> 36:30.839
We're searching that copse over
there.

36:31.959 --> 36:33.959
(FRUSTRATED SIGH)

36:47.159 --> 36:49.439
(SIGHS AND TUTS)

37:44.920 --> 37:46.920
Aiden.

37:46.959 --> 37:48.959
Forget the dogs.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Bring in the divers.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.800
They're pulling it out now. We'll
run a trace.

37:59.039 --> 38:01.039
As soon as we've had a proper look.

38:02.639 --> 38:04.639
I'll get back to you, yeah.

38:04.839 --> 38:08.079
Any markings? Nothing. No reg plates
either.

38:17.159 --> 38:19.800
Ma'am, they traced the landline that
made the call.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.560
It was a phone box outside the pub
in Metherington. In here, please.

38:24.639 --> 38:27.839
So madam here waited outside the
funeral

38:27.879 --> 38:29.879
and lured her into a trap.

38:30.839 --> 38:34.319
Now that fits with what that
solicitor told us about stalking.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.479
Why are you even listening to this?

38:36.519 --> 38:39.400
Everything that came out of Faye's
mouth was a lie.

38:39.439 --> 38:42.879
So I'd be right in thinking there
was a lot of animosity between you?

38:42.920 --> 38:44.720
It was very complicated.

38:45.439 --> 38:48.119
Look, look... I wasn't perfect.

38:48.720 --> 38:52.039
And, God bless her, she lost her mam
at 14

38:52.079 --> 38:54.239
and I know it didn't help me turning
up.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.680
But Faye was not an easy person.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.519
She brought it on herself, is that
what you're saying?

38:59.560 --> 39:01.319
She caused trouble for people.

39:01.959 --> 39:03.959
She went after people's husbands.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
She was a class-A blackmailer!

39:06.519 --> 39:10.759
Nevertheless, we have a witness who
says you tried to run her over.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.639
Yes, and he's completely crooked
too.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.000
Ask anyone from the legal
profession.

39:17.839 --> 39:19.600
Listen to me.

39:19.639 --> 39:23.039
This will be her doing some nasty
bloke

39:23.079 --> 39:25.079
and ruining someone's life.

39:26.959 --> 39:29.680
Well, she won't be doing it any more
will she, pet,

39:29.720 --> 39:31.720
now someone's ruined hers?

39:37.400 --> 39:40.039
Excuse me, ma'am. Can I run
something by you?

39:46.360 --> 39:48.319
What?

39:48.360 --> 39:50.800
It's a tricky one. Not sure what to
make of it.

39:50.839 --> 39:52.720
Ah, well, come on, spit it out.

39:52.759 --> 39:55.879
I've got Faye's phone history.
And about three weeks ago

39:55.920 --> 39:59.159
she searched online for 'How to
accuse someone of rape'.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.759
How to accuse someone
or how to report someone?

40:03.800 --> 40:05.920
I know. Funny wording, isn't it?

40:07.280 --> 40:08.839
Hm.

40:08.879 --> 40:13.400
I've done a bit of digging. None of
our sexual violence team have any
record of her.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.119
What about assault referral centres?
I'll do that next.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.920
What do you make of it?

40:21.519 --> 40:24.439
It suggests she was thinking of
making an allegation.

40:24.479 --> 40:27.400
What, as in reporting it or as in
making something up?

40:28.039 --> 40:30.600
Well, I suppose more likely the
former.

40:34.159 --> 40:36.439
Er...it may not be relevant.

40:36.479 --> 40:38.920
Well, of course it's relevant.

40:38.959 --> 40:43.000
We can't ignore this if she's been
assaulted, not by a long chalk.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.720
But then...she has been accused of
being economical with the truth.

40:50.239 --> 40:53.319
But calling her a liar over something
like this...

40:53.360 --> 40:56.000
That'd be terrible if we got that
wrong. Hm?

40:56.039 --> 41:00.119
Then I'll work on the assumption she
suffered some kind of attack. Right.

41:00.879 --> 41:04.079
Oh, there you are. We traced the
chassis number of the van.

41:04.119 --> 41:07.439
Brace yourself. (SCOFFS) I've been
braced since the '80s, pet.

41:07.479 --> 41:10.560
The van belonged to Roddy Maplin,
recently deceased.

41:26.119 --> 41:28.519
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
Ma'am.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.519
Loads of these in plastic boxes in
the back of the van.

41:34.039 --> 41:36.039
Some of them never even got wet.

41:36.439 --> 41:38.600
Oh, my life.

41:41.319 --> 41:43.759
Reckon he was about 15 grand
in the red.

41:44.639 --> 41:47.720
Turned down by the banks. Went to
these guys.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.560
Even they were saying no in the end.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.720
Well, that's enough to make anyone
desperate, isn't it?

41:54.839 --> 41:56.800
Poor sod.

41:57.879 --> 41:59.879
So what's he been spending money on?

42:00.959 --> 42:05.079
Not clear. Er, could be snowballing
interest rates.

42:06.079 --> 42:10.400
But, on the other hand, he was
transferring money into Faye's bank
account.

42:11.920 --> 42:16.159
Regular as clockwork, the last eight
months or so. Well, follow that up,
Ken.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.400
And have a good look at her accounts
too.

42:19.319 --> 42:21.879
Now, why was Roddy giving her money?

42:22.560 --> 42:25.519
Well, Jac's got a theory about
blackmail.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.560
Aye, but is that plausible?

42:27.600 --> 42:31.159
She accuses him of rape and he pays
up straightaway?

42:31.200 --> 42:34.680
(SCOFFS) Nah. Could be a piece of
work from what people have said.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.000
And could be a saint from what
others have said.

42:38.239 --> 42:41.439
Er, manipulative,
ripped off her dad.

42:41.479 --> 42:44.319
But then she gives free lifts
to old biddies.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.560
'The love of our life.' 'Our rock.'

42:47.759 --> 42:49.759
This doesn't add up.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.319
But if we think she had a habit of
extracting money - I know, I know.

42:53.360 --> 42:58.439
But it's all a bit much, isn't it?
Blackmail. Extortion. It'll be
something else tomorrow.

43:03.159 --> 43:04.759
I could kick myself.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.639
We've been wasting time, faffing
about with her past and her family.

43:08.680 --> 43:12.119
It was someone in her immediate
circle who killed her, wasn't it?

43:12.159 --> 43:15.720
It seems unlikely Susan would have
nicked Roddy's van. Didn't know him.

43:15.759 --> 43:18.239
Shall I bail her? Yeah, we're gonna
have to.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.479
I mean, all this business of
childhood cruelty.

43:21.519 --> 43:23.839
I mean, is that fact or fiction?
Who knows?

43:23.879 --> 43:26.000
But what we do know is that
the killer's

43:26.039 --> 43:28.759
now had a few days to get their story
straight.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.239
I wanna know who her mates were
locally.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.280
All the ins and outs.

43:34.319 --> 43:37.920
And that CCTV. Has that given us
anything? No-one followed her out.

43:37.959 --> 43:42.920
So the killer arrived in the area
after she did and never went inside.

43:42.959 --> 43:44.959
Hm. Bail Susan.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Are you Josh?

43:53.039 --> 43:55.280
DCI Stanhope? Yeah.

43:55.319 --> 43:57.319
You got the paperwork?

44:11.400 --> 44:13.000
Great.

44:14.560 --> 44:17.879
So, you were the attending officer,
hm? Yeah.

44:18.519 --> 44:20.800
This your first hanging? Second.

44:21.439 --> 44:23.759
Not a pleasant experience, is it?

44:24.839 --> 44:26.839
You'll not get used to it.

44:27.879 --> 44:30.920
No phone records. No, we didn't have
the resources.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.959
But the afternoon he died,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.680
he was texted an address by someone
called Faye.

44:36.280 --> 44:38.479
How do you know he was texted an
address?

44:38.519 --> 44:41.319
I...I went on his phone. Without a
warrant?

44:41.360 --> 44:44.439
I was looking for his emergency
contact. I just...saw it.

44:44.479 --> 44:46.519
You'll get yourself in hot water,
lad.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.600
In front of a barrister, he'll tear
you to shreds.

44:49.639 --> 44:51.639
Yeah, I...I know.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.119
Did he reply?

45:00.800 --> 45:02.800
'I can't do this any more.'

45:03.600 --> 45:05.600
Didn't leave a note?

45:05.639 --> 45:07.639
We didn't find one.

45:08.959 --> 45:11.839
Why's she texting him this address?

45:11.879 --> 45:15.119
Have you been there? It's just been
me doing the whole thing.

45:15.839 --> 45:17.839
Hm. Busy beat, is it?

45:17.879 --> 45:20.519
The usual. Fighting.
In and out of A&E.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.800
(GROANS) No-one pressing charges.
I remember it well.

45:23.839 --> 45:27.839
Hopefully, now it's linked to a
murder, we might get some answers.

45:27.879 --> 45:30.119
You know, for his wife and Liam.

45:30.159 --> 45:33.200
What do you make of them? Smashing
people.

45:33.239 --> 45:35.959
And how they're coping, you know,
considering.

45:40.400 --> 45:44.439
You local boys do a good job. You
don't get many pats on the back, do
you?

45:44.479 --> 45:46.319
Not really.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.079
If this goes well, Josh,

45:48.119 --> 45:50.360
I'll make sure you get some credit.

45:56.560 --> 46:00.079
This place is full of students.
What was Faye doing here?

46:01.400 --> 46:04.280
Any intelligence? A few noise
complaints -

46:04.319 --> 46:06.319
parties - a couple of years back.

46:07.439 --> 46:09.439
And nothing connects her to here?

46:09.479 --> 46:11.519
It's not a previous address? Nope.

46:13.879 --> 46:15.879
Right.

46:26.680 --> 46:31.159
It's not illegal, is it? Well,
technically, it could be fraud
on your landlord.

46:31.200 --> 46:34.680
We were just trying to make some
extra cash. We're broke.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.560
So's the taxman.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.600
How often did she come over?

46:39.039 --> 46:42.079
You'd know. Mate. (SIGHS)

46:42.680 --> 46:45.680
I'm just saying
you were the one speaking with her.

46:46.959 --> 46:51.280
Basically, we were looking for a new
housemate, you know, to put in the
lounge.

46:51.319 --> 46:54.319
She got in touch, said... If we
cleared out every Saturday,

46:54.360 --> 46:58.000
she'd give us the same money as one
day a week. So you handed over the
keys

46:58.039 --> 47:00.159
and went off to the seaside for the
day?

47:03.360 --> 47:05.360
What was she using the place for?

47:08.560 --> 47:12.560
She paid in cash, so...
We thought she was a hooker.

47:13.360 --> 47:15.879
Hooker? Do you mean a sex worker?

47:17.920 --> 47:21.319
Is that why you're here? It's just
part of an ongoing inquiry.

47:23.439 --> 47:25.439
Oh, my God. She's dead.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
What? Is that why?

47:28.039 --> 47:31.360
Does this fella...
Does he ring a bell?

47:32.039 --> 47:34.360
Did he kill her? Just answer her
question.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.720
We just cleared out. We didn't see
anyone.

47:43.079 --> 47:45.079
I swear, I haven't seen him.

47:53.600 --> 47:55.680
I'll get on to the exploitation
unit,

47:55.720 --> 47:59.200
see if there's any intelligence of
this being a pop-up. A what?

47:59.239 --> 48:02.000
A brothel being used by transient
sex workers.

48:03.159 --> 48:05.479
Well, you never know. Aye.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.200
Maybe.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.800
What are you thinking?

48:14.600 --> 48:16.879
Well, it's just not sitting right,
is it?

48:17.560 --> 48:19.720
Sex worker I can buy.

48:19.759 --> 48:22.639
But she wasn't desperate, there's no
drug history.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.680
Yeah, but she was broke.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.920
Mm. I don't know. Maybe it could
be...

48:28.920 --> 48:31.200
..massages
with a few extras thrown in.

48:31.879 --> 48:34.000
Got someone's back up

48:34.039 --> 48:36.039
Yeah, maybe.

48:36.879 --> 48:38.600
Maybe.

48:58.759 --> 49:01.839
Well, it's similar, yeah, but it
can't be his.

49:01.879 --> 49:04.280
Why not? Cos his is in the garage.

49:06.119 --> 49:09.319
You drove it back, didn't you? Yeah,
before the ceremony.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.639
Right.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.959
Well, can I see it? If you must.
Garage isn't locked.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
What, it's never locked? No.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.639
Well, that's a bit dodgy, isn't it?
Anyone could have access to it.

49:22.680 --> 49:24.680
I suppose.

49:26.039 --> 49:29.400
Look, I'm sorry, love, I've got
a difficult question to ask you.

49:29.439 --> 49:33.119
Is it more difficult than asking me
to identify my husband's body?

49:37.119 --> 49:39.239
Do you have any sense at all...

49:39.959 --> 49:42.079
..of why your husband took his own
life?

49:44.159 --> 49:46.600
Well, he'd always been depressed, on
and off.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.280
I know he tried in his teens.

49:49.800 --> 49:53.560
The psychiatrist said he fitted
a pattern. He lost his job.

49:53.600 --> 49:56.079
He went downhill after that.
Got paranoid.

49:56.119 --> 49:57.920
A bit, yeah.

49:58.639 --> 50:00.920
You know, like people were out to
get him.

50:00.959 --> 50:04.360
How? He always thought people were
cheating him or whatever.

50:07.159 --> 50:11.079
Oh, look, I hate to get personal,
but - I know, I know. Just doing
your job.

50:12.639 --> 50:14.839
Is there any chance at all...

50:15.400 --> 50:17.560
..your husband and Faye

50:17.600 --> 50:20.200
were in any kind of relationship?
No way!

50:22.200 --> 50:26.119
Next question. Well, you both seem
very sure of that.

50:26.159 --> 50:27.959
He loved Mum. It's not just cos of
that.

50:28.680 --> 50:32.000
Roddy and Noel were like brothers.
No way he'd have gone after Faye.

50:43.039 --> 50:46.039
'And then we drove it back to his
garage.' 'When was this?'

50:46.079 --> 50:48.600
It was before the funeral. Us and
Liam.

50:48.639 --> 50:51.560
We had to transport, like, a massive
photo of him.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.280
What did you do with the keys?

50:54.319 --> 50:56.319
Roddy leaves them in the glove box.

50:56.360 --> 50:59.360
What was the nature of Roddy and
Faye's relationship?

50:59.879 --> 51:02.639
Well, er, they were friends, I
suppose.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.720
Is there a chance anything else
could've gone on between them?

51:07.759 --> 51:09.759
What, like an affair?

51:10.959 --> 51:12.439
No.

51:12.479 --> 51:14.479
No, he was too under the thumb.

51:16.479 --> 51:19.959
What? You always said he's under the
thumb. I said he was loyal.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.439
Well, she wasn't loyal to him,
though, was she?

51:27.079 --> 51:28.680
Right.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.920
There's a bit of a secret hanging
about.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.039
Carolyn and me, we messed about
a bit...

51:38.039 --> 51:40.159
..when she first got together with
Roddy.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.720
I'm Liam's dad.

51:46.519 --> 51:49.200
I'm not proud about it, but I love
that kid

51:49.239 --> 51:53.119
and I loved Roddy, so I...I backed
off for both their sakes.

51:54.360 --> 51:56.360
Did Roddy know?

51:56.400 --> 51:58.119
No.

51:58.159 --> 52:00.519
I think he might have suspected, I
think.

52:02.039 --> 52:06.119
In truth, I think I had a part to
play in er...

52:07.159 --> 52:09.159
..what he did to himself.

52:23.759 --> 52:25.759
(SIGHS)

52:26.600 --> 52:28.600
As we thought, no van.

52:28.639 --> 52:30.639
Well, Noel reckons he returned it.

52:32.039 --> 52:34.039
Does he indeed?

52:35.200 --> 52:38.000
What was his alibi again? Out the
back with Liam.

52:38.039 --> 52:41.079
Oh. Apparently, Liam's his son not
Roddy's.

52:43.319 --> 52:45.319
Well, she never mentioned that.

52:46.280 --> 52:49.039
But there again, maybe the lad
doesn't know.

52:49.079 --> 52:51.839
Could have found out. That could be
relevant.

52:53.639 --> 52:56.319
Could that lad have done something
like this?

52:56.360 --> 52:58.360
Possibly.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.400
Bit smart, but you never know.

53:02.239 --> 53:04.239
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

53:04.280 --> 53:08.400
Roddy texted Faye shortly before he
dies,

53:08.439 --> 53:10.439
'Can't do this any more.'

53:11.879 --> 53:13.759
If it's not an affair, what is it?

53:13.800 --> 53:16.039
I mean, what are they doing at that
address?

53:18.239 --> 53:20.239
(SIGHS)

53:21.319 --> 53:24.079
Remind me why she left the funeral
early.

53:24.119 --> 53:26.239
On duty, they're saying. Yeah,
but...

53:26.280 --> 53:28.280
No, that's odd, isn't it? Is it?

53:28.319 --> 53:30.759
Well, why would you choose to be on
duty

53:30.800 --> 53:34.680
if the bloke you've been texting on
the quiet is being laid to rest?

53:35.920 --> 53:38.239
Because you didn't want to be there.
Why?

53:38.280 --> 53:40.280
Because you can't face it...

53:40.319 --> 53:42.319
or because you drove them to it?

53:49.200 --> 53:52.360
None of the assault referral centres
have any record of her.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.319
Right.

53:54.360 --> 53:57.360
So she didn't report it or...

53:58.839 --> 54:00.839
..or there was nothing to report?

54:00.879 --> 54:04.519
Kenny, have you got her bank stuff?
On its way. Right. Sums in, sums out

54:04.560 --> 54:07.680
and tally it against the days she was
at that house. Ma'am.

54:07.720 --> 54:10.639
And for what it's worth, one of the
drivers at the cab firm

54:10.680 --> 54:14.479
was convinced the killing would be
the result of a sex feud.
'Sex feud'?

54:14.519 --> 54:17.800
That a technical term? I'm just
recounting what he told me.

54:17.839 --> 54:19.839
What's this fella's name? Um...

54:19.879 --> 54:22.280
Don't just sit there, get it up on
the board.

54:24.479 --> 54:26.959
What? Thought we were going to be
nice to her.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.280
I want her to do well, but she's got
to be on top of the basics.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.560
Give her a few pointers.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.159
You might be the blue-eyed boy now,

54:37.200 --> 54:40.479
but you weren't so quick off the mark
when you first came here.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.959
Is that a compliment? Aye.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.159
Make the most of it. Thanks, love.

54:48.439 --> 54:50.439
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

55:13.600 --> 55:15.600
No coffee for me then?

55:15.639 --> 55:19.239
Er, sorry, Marcus. I can never
remember what you like.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.920
Just...just a latte.

55:20.959 --> 55:23.400
See? In one ear and out the other.

55:23.439 --> 55:25.039
(CHUCKLES)

55:25.079 --> 55:28.519
Cause of death: Traumatic injuries
following a high-speed collision.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.959
I'm sorry I don't have anything new
for you.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.039
Well, I'm glad I came all this way.

55:33.079 --> 55:35.720
No drink, drugs? Not that I could
find.

55:35.759 --> 55:38.159
Nor any signs of assault,
thankfully.

55:39.159 --> 55:43.119
Report on the foetus: Survived the
impact because of the amniotic sac,

55:43.159 --> 55:46.400
but died from a lack of oxygen when
Mum when into cardiac arrest.

55:46.439 --> 55:48.639
There's one thing that might be
useful.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.360
It's her GP notes. She had
a termination booked.

55:51.400 --> 55:54.720
So there should be some sort of
confirmation letter at home.

55:55.439 --> 55:57.439
Well, that is useful.

55:57.879 --> 55:59.720
Thanks.

55:59.759 --> 56:03.039
Also, I was packing these up
for the funeral director

56:03.079 --> 56:05.519
and I found this in her pocket.

56:06.519 --> 56:08.519
Paternity result.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.920
Well, well, well.

56:15.959 --> 56:18.720
We should've listened to the
stepmother.

56:18.759 --> 56:21.000
Pregnant by her married boss.

56:32.200 --> 56:34.200
Paternity results.

56:34.239 --> 56:39.239
Now then...these results were found
in her clothing the day she died.

56:39.280 --> 56:42.119
So it's safe to assume she'd taken
'em to the funeral.

56:42.159 --> 56:44.000
A bit of an odd thing to do,

56:44.039 --> 56:47.519
but emotions are running high, so
it's not out of the question.

56:47.560 --> 56:51.879
Also her GP confirmed that she'd
booked a termination.

56:51.920 --> 56:54.000
So, what are we to make of that?

56:54.720 --> 56:57.639
If she has got a history of
extracting cash from blokes,

56:57.680 --> 57:00.680
was there a confrontation about
these results with Tony?

57:00.720 --> 57:02.759
Hang on, I saw something
on the CCTV.

57:05.879 --> 57:07.879
So, is this the DNA results?

57:07.920 --> 57:09.920
I think you're right.

57:11.119 --> 57:15.200
Get on to that clinic who did the
testing and see what else they can
tell us.

57:15.239 --> 57:17.239
I'll go and question him. Hang on.

57:17.879 --> 57:21.119
Let's dig for as much as we can first
and then bring him in.

57:21.759 --> 57:25.319
Mark, find me someone who saw Tony
leave that funeral.

57:58.119 --> 58:01.519
Were you having a sexual
relationship?

58:01.560 --> 58:03.639
No. I love my wife.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.680
Look, I swear on my life, I wasn't.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.319
(SIGHS)

58:08.360 --> 58:11.720
She might've had a thing for me, but
I never did anything about it.

58:11.759 --> 58:14.519
Oh, now we're getting somewhere.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.560
So what sort of thing?

58:16.600 --> 58:19.720
Like, she used to tell me she
fancied me or whatever.

58:19.759 --> 58:22.239
I used to just ignore it. Really?

58:22.280 --> 58:25.200
Were you not flattered? No. Hm?
It was scary.

58:25.239 --> 58:27.759
I was paranoid she'd turn up in
fishnets and a mac.

58:27.800 --> 58:29.759
Oh, so now she's Loopy Lou.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.639
That's easy to say, now she's not
here to say different.

58:34.560 --> 58:36.560
So, what happened? Hm?

58:37.680 --> 58:40.239
You fall out when she threatened to
tell your missus?

58:40.280 --> 58:43.200
No, because we never -
(GROANS) If you never,

58:43.239 --> 58:45.680
how come you fathered her child?

58:45.720 --> 58:47.720
I didn't.

58:47.759 --> 58:50.119
Well, who's told you that? DNA test.

58:50.159 --> 58:53.319
What DNA test? Look, you can't just
DNA test me.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.239
Why, because the truth will out?

58:55.280 --> 58:58.400
No, because this is the first I've
heard of any DNA test.

58:58.439 --> 58:59.920
Oh, is that right?

58:59.959 --> 59:02.600
Well, what's she showing you here,
pet?

59:02.639 --> 59:05.439
Hm? Caught on CCTV.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.479
Well, I don't know. I can't
remember.

59:10.239 --> 59:12.439
I think she showed you these
results...

59:12.479 --> 59:16.400
and then you followed her out and you
killed her to shut her up.

59:16.439 --> 59:19.360
And why would I do that? You tell
me, love.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.800
As you say, you love your wife.

59:33.680 --> 59:36.159
Are you charging him? No, not yet.

59:37.119 --> 59:39.600
Why, what have you got? Well, Tony
Everitt's

59:39.639 --> 59:42.159
been making cash deposits in Faye's
account.

59:42.920 --> 59:46.920
The lass at the branch recognised
him. Well, that's it then - hush
money.

59:46.959 --> 59:50.759
Faye goes after him about the affair,
then ups the ante with the DNA.

59:50.800 --> 59:53.720
That fits the pattern, doesn't it?
Hold your horses.

59:53.759 --> 59:56.360
We can't link him to the crash.
Remind me why not?

59:56.400 --> 59:58.400
He's all over the CCTV.

59:58.439 --> 1:00:01.000
Getting rounds in. Makes a big
speech at the end.

1:00:01.039 --> 1:00:03.560
Well, maybe he'd slipped out. I
thought that.

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:07.319
But we found six people said they'd
vouch that he was there. Six?!

1:00:07.360 --> 1:00:11.759
I know. Popular fella by all
accounts. Are they genuine or are
they covering for him?

1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:15.039
Hard to say. Well, is there a window
of opportunity?

1:00:15.079 --> 1:00:17.200
Max probably a half hour.

1:00:19.639 --> 1:00:21.720
Well, that won't stick then, will it?

1:00:22.519 --> 1:00:26.519
Getting that van into the lake.
That's, what, a couple of hours at
least.

1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:28.560
OK, well, if it's not him then who?

1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:30.600
Somebody who was linked to him?

1:00:32.639 --> 1:00:35.759
There's the person who gave her the
details in the car.

1:00:37.319 --> 1:00:39.000
The missus.

1:00:41.039 --> 1:00:44.560
Are you sure this is the right
address? It's the one they gave us.

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:53.079
Huh! How can a cabbie afford this?

1:00:53.119 --> 1:00:55.119
He owns the business.

1:00:55.159 --> 1:00:58.759
What? It's ten foot by ten foot and a
bit of gravel.

1:00:59.239 --> 1:01:01.239
Well, he has got a few drivers.

1:01:02.079 --> 1:01:04.239
There's only him and Faye on the
website.

1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:07.600
So what are the other drivers doing
with themselves all day?

1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:19.600
(DOORBELL)

1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:35.280
What can I do for you guys?

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:39.680
Yes, I gave her the fare details. I
already told you that.

1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:41.720
Hm. Did you make them up?

1:01:41.759 --> 1:01:43.680
Why on earth would I?

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:45.920
I don't know. Lay a trap

1:01:45.959 --> 1:01:49.680
cos you found out about the affair
with your husband? Oh, no. No way.

1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:51.720
He didn't even fancy her.

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:55.319
Are you sure about that? We talked
about it.

1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:57.839
It was like a joke how much she
fancied him.

1:01:57.879 --> 1:01:59.759
I thought it was sweet.

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:03.200
And did you think it was sweet he was
taking money from your business

1:02:03.239 --> 1:02:06.360
and putting it into her bank account?
I did, actually, yes.

1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:08.400
We felt sorry for her.

1:02:08.439 --> 1:02:11.119
She was broke.
We wanted to help her out.

1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:15.200
And did you know she was pregnant by
your husband?

1:02:16.319 --> 1:02:18.239
If she said that, it's wishful
thinking.

1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:21.000
I'm sorry, love, we've got proof. I
don't believe this.

1:02:21.039 --> 1:02:23.839
You're not gonna get me to say I
hated her. I didn't.

1:02:23.879 --> 1:02:25.680
I felt sorry for her.

1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:28.639
The things she's gone through, I
wouldn't wish on anyone.

1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:30.680
And neither would my husband.

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:32.720
So I think you better send him home.

1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.200
Well, she's either lying or she's
completely stupid.

1:02:40.239 --> 1:02:42.479
Stand by your man? Aye.

1:02:42.879 --> 1:02:44.879
Or vice versa.

1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:47.639
But then why would she log it on the
system?

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:49.519
I mean, if she was laying a trap

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:51.639
she'd phone Faye direct, wouldn't
she?

1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:54.759
Oh, this is daft. It doesn't make any
sense.

1:02:55.759 --> 1:02:57.560
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

1:02:57.600 --> 1:02:59.600
We're missing something.

1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:03.439
Probably something staring us right
in the face.

1:03:06.239 --> 1:03:09.319
She certainly got people to feel
sorry for her, didn't she?

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:12.319
I think she said whatever came into
her head to get attention.

1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:14.839
Well, that doesn't make her a bad
person. No.

1:03:17.119 --> 1:03:21.800
But if someone pretending to be all
tragic suddenly meets a tragic
death...

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000
..what are we to make of that?

1:03:38.039 --> 1:03:39.519
Ma'am.

1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:42.680
The DNA clinic says that the doctor
that sent this report

1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:45.079
has been off sick for at least eight
months.

1:03:45.119 --> 1:03:47.119
So, how did she get them then?

1:03:49.879 --> 1:03:51.879
Maybe she didn't.

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:55.680
Well, could she have made them?

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.319
Copied it off the Internet? Is that
possible?

1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.119
Er, that's not just a cut-and-paste
job, but it's possible.

1:04:07.039 --> 1:04:10.119
You know what? Tony...swore blind

1:04:10.159 --> 1:04:12.879
he wasn't having a sexual
relationship with her.

1:04:14.319 --> 1:04:16.319
And now I'm inclined to believe him.

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:22.720
But he claimed he didn't know what
was on that piece of paper.

1:04:22.759 --> 1:04:26.319
And that I don't believe. Get that
CCTV up.

1:04:27.079 --> 1:04:29.479
Look, freeze it there. Now, it was me

1:04:29.519 --> 1:04:32.479
insisting that was the DNA results.

1:04:32.519 --> 1:04:34.920
So, why didn't Tony put me right?

1:04:34.959 --> 1:04:37.159
Hm? Clear himself?

1:04:38.479 --> 1:04:41.159
Because whatever it was they were
discussing...

1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:46.039
was something worse. Ma'am. I've been
through the till roll from the bar.

1:04:46.079 --> 1:04:48.680
Looks like Tony paid the whole tab
for the wake.

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:50.720
The whole tab?!

1:04:50.759 --> 1:04:53.360
Oh, St Anthony of the Minicabs!

1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:56.439
Nothing to see here. See I knew he
sounded dodgy.

1:04:56.479 --> 1:05:00.920
Everyone vouching for him. Aiden,
get over and wear one of those
witnesses down.

1:05:00.959 --> 1:05:05.280
If you can do it while he's still in
custody, chances are someone might
buckle.

1:05:05.959 --> 1:05:10.479
Now then, alternative theories
connecting Tony and Faye.

1:05:11.079 --> 1:05:14.239
If it's not some sort of paternity or
mistress set-up,

1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:17.720
what is it they're doing means
money's rattling between them?

1:05:17.759 --> 1:05:20.879
Something lucrative, judging by the
house. Good money.

1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:24.800
But off the radar.
So small, but lots of it.

1:05:24.839 --> 1:05:26.839
Ah, so what are we saying? Weed?

1:05:27.439 --> 1:05:29.800
We got any intelligence on that?

1:05:29.839 --> 1:05:32.720
Nothing's coming up. I can push the
neighbourhood team.

1:05:32.759 --> 1:05:36.479
Right. Dodgy trainers. Dodgy fags.
Designer gear works.

1:05:36.519 --> 1:05:38.519
It draws less attention to itself.

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:43.159
Where was the money supposedly
coming from? Rental properties, but
that could be rubbish.

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:47.800
Maybe he's a dodgy landlord. Owns
half the area and his tenants are
protecting him.

1:05:47.839 --> 1:05:50.360
All these properties are in town.

1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:52.400
Let to students, mainly.

1:06:07.639 --> 1:06:09.639
(SIREN WAILS)

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:19.000
JAC: You said Faye came round.
Yeah, um, she used to come round

1:06:19.039 --> 1:06:21.039
either like a Saturday or a Sunday.

1:06:22.079 --> 1:06:24.759
So long as we cleared off, we got
paid for the day.

1:06:25.479 --> 1:06:27.519
It weren't even me, it was Owen.

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.920
Really? He reckons you started it. He
was the one that put up the ad.

1:06:31.959 --> 1:06:34.879
What, and your landlord found it?
That what happened?

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:39.319
Then what? What did Tony Everitt draw
you into?

1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:42.159
Nothing. Everything else I told you
was true.

1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:45.639
He told us to give Faye the house
for one day a week and he'd turn
a blind eye.

1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:47.879
You'd turn a blind eye, more like.

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:51.439
Now, listen, son, you're from a nice
family.

1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:55.000
Did you really sit back and let some
bloke

1:06:55.039 --> 1:06:57.720
run a criminal enterprise from your
front room?

1:06:58.959 --> 1:07:01.159
Hm? It really didn't seem that bad.

1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:03.200
Just people coming in and out.

1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:07.879
I think people were pleased to see
'em. It's not as if they were thugs.

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:10.639
Well, I don't believe he didn't buy
your silence.

1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:12.439
All right, he waived the rent.

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.400
Look, I'm about to graduate 30 grand
down. I needed the money.

1:07:18.159 --> 1:07:20.360
I think I've got it. OK. What do I
need to do?

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:25.119
No, just listen. We've got a broke
community that has Tony's back.

1:07:25.159 --> 1:07:28.879
We've got him putting large amounts
of cash into Faye's bank account.

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:31.600
There's poor old Roddy,
who's run out of credit

1:07:31.639 --> 1:07:34.839
with the payday loans people, meeting
Faye on the quiet.

1:07:34.879 --> 1:07:37.959
What if Tony's a loan shark and Faye
was working for him?

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:42.879
And people are defending him because
they're scared. (MOBILE RINGS)
Exactly. They're all in hock.

1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:46.400
Get on to the Citizens Advice and see
if there's any sniff of it.

1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:49.839
Aiden, I'm on to something. What have
you got?

1:07:49.879 --> 1:07:52.079
I think I've unpicked what they were
up to.

1:07:52.119 --> 1:07:55.800
Yeah, loan sharks, right? I've found
a witness who's prepared to talk.

1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:06.439
WOMAN: She turned me down the first
time I asked her.

1:08:07.239 --> 1:08:09.479
Told me to cut back on my spending.

1:08:09.519 --> 1:08:11.519
(MUTED CONVERSATION)

1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:15.039
There's only so much you can cut
out, so I lied a bit

1:08:15.079 --> 1:08:18.959
about how I'd make the repayments
and she set us up with this meeting.

1:08:20.159 --> 1:08:23.600
She had this, like, studenty
house...

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:26.600
..where she did the handover.

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.439
I think it started as a grand.

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:32.800
But then, by the time you've paid it
back,

1:08:32.839 --> 1:08:35.759
it's more like two grand and I
just...

1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:39.400
I just didn't think it through.

1:08:39.439 --> 1:08:43.119
Anyway, I soon found out they
weren't all as nice as she was.

1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:46.600
She tried her best but he...

1:08:46.639 --> 1:08:48.239
Tony?

1:08:50.759 --> 1:08:52.759
He set the dogs on me.

1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:56.000
And then there was nothing
she could do.

1:08:56.680 --> 1:08:58.680
Who are the dogs, love?

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:01.439
They the others drivers? They the
muscle?

1:09:05.959 --> 1:09:08.319
First they take your stuff.

1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:10.360
Then when all that's gone...

1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:13.560
..they try to scare you.

1:09:17.439 --> 1:09:20.200
And you had not even the slightest
inkling

1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:23.560
there were organised criminals
working in the area? None.

1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:27.159
Disorganised criminals maybe.
People getting themselves in messes.

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:29.200
Ah. The ones you take to A&E.

1:09:29.239 --> 1:09:32.360
The ones who've been fighting and
don't press charges.

1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:35.800
Well, they've been fighting cos
they're poor, aren't they?

1:09:35.839 --> 1:09:38.439
Not cos some fella's been pushing 'em
about.

1:09:42.759 --> 1:09:44.920
Not Community's finest hour.

1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:49.800
Was there anything else?

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:02.800
There's hundreds of them. How do you
silence hundreds of people?

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:05.800
Well, make them think they're the
only one.

1:10:05.839 --> 1:10:09.800
Shame. Yeah. Definitely not the
'back of a fag packet' operation.

professional.

1:10:17.159 --> 1:10:19.319
has evidence of loan shark activity.

1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:21.239
I can do better than that.

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:24.439

motive for murder.

driven to topping themselves. It's
not right.

aware of it?

1:10:32.439 --> 1:10:34.639

Right. You do realise

1:10:36.879 --> 1:10:39.439
that what you're telling me isn't
confidential?

1:10:39.479 --> 1:10:42.519
OK. Can you give me your name?

1:10:43.959 --> 1:10:46.479
Faye. Just Faye.

1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:51.959
That's it. And this was, what, three
days before she died?

1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:57.159
Well, that explains someone's lack of
memory at the funeral, doesn't it?

1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:00.319
Did she tell you she was going to
report you? No.

1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:02.519
So did you try to shut her up? No.

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:04.560
Mm.

1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:07.159
Now, you went to the funeral. Why?

1:11:08.959 --> 1:11:12.400
Ah, to see how it was panning out
with the community,

1:11:12.439 --> 1:11:15.000
now that Roddy had gone and done what
he'd done.

1:11:15.039 --> 1:11:17.039
See if anyone was blaming you.

1:11:17.079 --> 1:11:19.319
Anyone going to spill the beans. No.

1:11:21.439 --> 1:11:24.639
Do you admit you've been lending
money illegally?

1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:32.439
I offered loans to friends, yes.

1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:36.680
But I didn't kill anyone or beat
anyone up

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:39.000
or anything else people might be
saying.

1:11:39.039 --> 1:11:41.119
So, why do you think they're saying
that?

1:11:41.159 --> 1:11:44.360
Cos if I get put away they don't
have to pay me back, do they?

1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:47.000
Oh! (CHUCKLES) Now, well, there is
that.

1:11:47.039 --> 1:11:49.920
Look, you've got this all wrong.
I was just the bank.

1:11:49.959 --> 1:11:54.079
She was the one making the
connections. That's right, blame
the dead person.

1:11:54.119 --> 1:11:56.600
She liked the money, I'm telling
you.

1:11:56.639 --> 1:11:59.639

handbag collection.

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:02.280

great big house

1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:07.720
Mm? Don't give me this businessman
tripe.

1:12:07.759 --> 1:12:10.759
You prey on the vulnerable, the
depressed...

1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:13.759
Well, a lot of people with
depression pay up on time. Yeah?

1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:15.800
Well, what about Roddy, hm?

1:12:15.839 --> 1:12:17.839
He was depressed.

1:12:18.839 --> 1:12:20.920
Did Faye ask you to let him off?

1:12:20.959 --> 1:12:22.639
Not really.

1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:27.039
Nah. Cos she never stood up to a
bully, did she?

1:12:27.079 --> 1:12:30.879
Well, I can't let off every Tom,
Dick and Harry she felt sorry for.

1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:33.959
No, so instead you killed her to shut
her up.

1:12:35.119 --> 1:12:39.400
You've got no evidence of that. No,
cos you've got everyone covering for
you.

1:12:39.439 --> 1:12:43.360
Nope, because I know I didn't do it.

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000
So you won't find any proof.

1:12:53.519 --> 1:12:55.519
(SIGHS)

1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:01.400
You all right, boss? Mm.

1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:04.400
All on Faye.

1:13:04.439 --> 1:13:06.280
Heart of stone, apparently.

1:13:07.439 --> 1:13:09.439
Well, that fits, doesn't it?

1:13:12.519 --> 1:13:16.519
Hang on. Is that the list of people
who owes him money?

1:13:27.079 --> 1:13:29.079
I should've thought of that.

1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:38.519
Simone.

1:13:40.319 --> 1:13:42.319
Sorry... See you later.

1:13:45.759 --> 1:13:48.600
Can we have a talk, pet? Have I done
something?

1:13:48.639 --> 1:13:52.959
Now, why do you say that? Sometimes I
do things that I don't realise.

1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:58.400
No. No, no, no. No, I just wanted to
ask you something private.

1:14:01.879 --> 1:14:05.039
Were you ever in debt to Tony
Everitt?

1:14:06.759 --> 1:14:09.200
Well, yeah, but Faye sorted it for
me.

1:14:09.239 --> 1:14:11.560
I just got in a muddle cos of my
maths.

1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:14.319
That's why I'm here, to get my GCSE
and that. Ah.

1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:17.000
But before Faye sorted it,

1:14:17.039 --> 1:14:21.720
did anyone try to get payment from
you...in another way?

1:14:24.479 --> 1:14:26.479
One of the dogs did, yeah.

1:14:28.839 --> 1:14:30.839
Said I owed him.

1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:34.920
You should've come to us, pet.

1:14:36.439 --> 1:14:38.439
Sexual assault.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000
We'd have believed you.

1:14:42.319 --> 1:14:44.560
Yeah, Faye said that. Aye.

1:14:45.959 --> 1:14:49.079
But, like, what if they found out

1:14:49.119 --> 1:14:51.119
and then did something worse?

1:15:07.839 --> 1:15:09.839
I...I can't say it.

1:15:10.959 --> 1:15:13.159
Well just...just try.

1:15:14.039 --> 1:15:16.519
I can't say it. You look like my
mam.

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:24.000
OK, love. Now, I'm going to arrange
for you to talk to an officer

1:15:24.039 --> 1:15:26.479
who specialises - I was still,
like...

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:31.319
..wearing my clothes. He didn't take
my clothes off.

1:15:35.959 --> 1:15:40.000
You know, that is still rape.

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000
Yeah, that's what Faye said.

1:15:45.039 --> 1:15:47.400
Did she take you to a referral
centre?

1:15:48.159 --> 1:15:50.800
Yeah, they did like er...forensic
stuff.

1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:54.119
But, at the end of the day, I just
thought...

1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:59.560
..I don't want the hassle. Now,
look, if there's forensic evidence on
file,

1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:02.920
that puts you in a great position
prosecution-wise.

1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:06.720
Yeah, Faye said that.

1:16:06.759 --> 1:16:10.720
Listen, we'd be with you every step
of the way this time.

1:16:12.239 --> 1:16:14.239
Yeah, maybe.

1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:17.280
Well, I'm not gonna force you.

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:20.560
You know, if she was here...

1:16:21.479 --> 1:16:23.479
..she'd know exactly what to do.

1:16:25.759 --> 1:16:27.759
She helped you a lot, didn't she?

1:16:28.639 --> 1:16:30.639
Said we'd win in the end.

1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:35.200
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Ah.

1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:46.920
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

1:16:53.319 --> 1:16:56.680
Violence, extracting money with
threats,

1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:59.759
and using rape to enforce - Rape?!

1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:03.400
Who's saying they've been raped?
I'm not going to disclose that.

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:07.239
Oh, there's a lot been done in your
name, pet.

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:09.280
We're just getting started.

1:17:09.319 --> 1:17:13.319
Illegal loans, inciting sexual
violence.

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:17.200
Well, a good brief might be able to
whittle that down to a few years.

1:17:17.239 --> 1:17:19.079
But murder...

1:17:19.119 --> 1:17:22.079
Nah, that'd be a life sentence.
You fancy that?

1:17:22.119 --> 1:17:25.280
I didn't - Faye had had enough.

1:17:25.319 --> 1:17:30.360
She sat at Roddy's funeral, watching
you glad-handing

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:33.959
and she told you she wasn't standing
for it any more, didn't she?

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:36.159
She told you the game was up. No.

1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:38.280
And you made a call.

1:17:38.319 --> 1:17:41.319
You got your wife to lure her out to
the car,

1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:43.720
you followed her and you killed her.

1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:46.759
No wonder it took you a while to open
up shop.

1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:50.400
The pair of you were getting your
story straight. No, we were trying

1:17:50.439 --> 1:17:52.439
to work out the best way to help.

1:17:52.479 --> 1:17:55.000
We're as upset about what happened
to Faye as anyone.

1:17:55.039 --> 1:17:57.039
Do you admit you lied?

1:18:01.039 --> 1:18:05.079
It was to deflect attention from my
financial activities.

1:18:05.119 --> 1:18:07.119
Now we're getting somewhere.

1:18:07.159 --> 1:18:11.680
But I didn't set a trap for her and
nor did my wife. Faye came to me.

1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:14.920
She wanted to leave, but she didn't
wanna just walk out.

1:18:14.959 --> 1:18:16.959
So I gave her a piece of paper

1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.680
where I'd written down a job that'd
just come in.

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:22.000
Someone had phoned it through to
Louise.

1:18:22.519 --> 1:18:24.600
And they'd asked for me by name.

1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:29.319
..that you've used physical
intimidation. No comment.

1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:30.959
Aiden.

1:18:36.119 --> 1:18:38.119
The target wasn't Faye.

1:18:38.159 --> 1:18:40.600
It was Tony. He was sent the address.

1:18:41.319 --> 1:18:43.519
Inadvertently passed it on to Faye.

1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:46.879
Now, taking that at face value...

1:18:50.879 --> 1:18:52.920
..who wanted him dead?

1:19:01.319 --> 1:19:03.839
A fair few of this lot'd be pleased
to see him gone.

1:19:03.879 --> 1:19:07.200
But of all of 'em, who'd he wronged
the most?

1:19:21.079 --> 1:19:24.400
Like, if you wanted to hurt Tony,
why kill Faye?

1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:28.720
Why not kill Louise? He loves
Louise. It doesn't make sense.

1:19:28.759 --> 1:19:32.800
See, I think they did want to kill
Tony.

1:19:33.959 --> 1:19:37.600
So, can you think of a reason why
someone would want to do that?

1:19:38.839 --> 1:19:41.319
Er, to get out of paying him back?

1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:46.079
Now, I think they did want to pay him
back.

1:19:46.119 --> 1:19:48.119
Pay him back for what they'd done

1:19:48.159 --> 1:19:50.680
to people like you, people like
Roddy.

1:19:51.319 --> 1:19:53.319
Who knew what'd happened to him?

1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:56.239
We all did, but no-one was narked
with Faye about it.

1:19:56.280 --> 1:19:59.560
No, because Faye looked out for
people, didn't she?

1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:02.439
Now, can you look out for her...

1:20:03.439 --> 1:20:05.800
..and go back over the night she
died?

1:20:07.079 --> 1:20:09.079
What about Liam?

1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:12.479
Well, you said he was out the back
with Noel.

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:15.400
Was that the truth?

1:20:15.439 --> 1:20:17.439
I don't know.

1:20:19.079 --> 1:20:21.800
Noel told me to say he was with him,
but...

1:20:22.759 --> 1:20:24.759
..I didn't see it myself.

1:20:26.079 --> 1:20:29.079
So Noel lied about his alibi?

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.600
Yeah, but only to protect his boy,
like.

1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:42.879
Right, well, go work on Liam.

1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:46.519
But go through his mam. Oh, she won't
want him wrapped up in this.

1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:48.560
Will do.

1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:48.119
We've got your prints on the van
that killed her.

1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:51.400
I told you I drove it.

1:21:51.439 --> 1:21:53.759
But we've also got Liam saying

1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:56.839
you weren't out the back of the pub
like you said you were.

1:21:58.119 --> 1:22:01.000
Did you tell him to lie?
He offered to lie...

1:22:02.519 --> 1:22:05.239
..cos I told him I drove the van
after a drink. Oh.

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:09.800
Course, he knew you'd never have
killed Faye cos you loved her.

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:13.680
Yeah.

1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:16.800
Didn't tell him you were out to get
Tony though, did you?

1:22:23.119 --> 1:22:26.600
Ah, you didn't plan it, I don't
think.

1:22:29.079 --> 1:22:32.239
I imagine the emotions of the day
took over.

1:22:33.479 --> 1:22:35.479
But what was it set you off, hm?

1:22:38.119 --> 1:22:41.439
Did Faye show you some DNA results at
the funeral?

1:22:43.239 --> 1:22:45.039
Yeah.

1:22:48.319 --> 1:22:50.800
I thought she had those to prove to
someone

1:22:50.839 --> 1:22:53.439
they were the father of her baby,
but now I see.

1:22:54.319 --> 1:22:56.600
They were to prove to you that you
wasn't.

1:22:58.519 --> 1:23:01.239
So, she tells you the baby's
Tony's...

1:23:02.239 --> 1:23:04.920
..to soften the blow. (SNIFFS)

1:23:07.119 --> 1:23:09.119
(TEARFULLY) Was it not Tony's then?

1:23:09.159 --> 1:23:12.759
I think she was trying to make you
feel better.

1:23:13.519 --> 1:23:17.280
After all, she knew that you'd missed
out with your son, Liam.

1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:29.000
So, do you want to tell me what
happened at the wake?

1:23:29.039 --> 1:23:31.039
We were both upset.

1:23:34.159 --> 1:23:36.159
So, did you confront Tony with it?

1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:38.720
No, I just watched him.

1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:44.400
I hated what he'd done to Faye, to
Roddy, to the village.

1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:46.800
To me, my future.

1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:52.280
I don't know what came over me.

1:23:53.039 --> 1:23:55.239
I went outside for a breath of fresh
air.

1:23:55.759 --> 1:23:58.879
Saw the phone, called the cab firm.

1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:01.639
I knew he was on duty. I knew it'd
bring him out.

1:24:01.680 --> 1:24:04.319
Got in the van. Watched the car pull
away.

1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:06.400
I just found myself following.

1:24:06.439 --> 1:24:10.400
I'd like to think I...I was only
going to scare him.

1:24:10.439 --> 1:24:13.319
But the truth is I don't know. I'm
not sure.

1:24:13.879 --> 1:24:16.479
I went home. Faye wasn't back.

1:24:16.519 --> 1:24:20.000
I...I didn't think anything of it.
I went to work.

1:24:20.039 --> 1:24:22.039
And there she was.

1:24:22.519 --> 1:24:25.600
I'm stood there and she's fighting
for her life and I...

1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:31.400
I'd killed the woman I loved more
than life itself.

though, won't it?

1:24:55.079 --> 1:24:58.360
I never wanted to kill her. Never.

1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:01.360
You laid a trap, pet.

1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:03.439
That makes it premeditated.

1:25:03.479 --> 1:25:06.360

murder.

deceased could wear that.

1:25:52.639 --> 1:25:54.639
I'm dropping these back.

1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:58.000
I don't think any of them are really
suitable. What's that?

1:25:59.039 --> 1:26:03.000
Oh, funeral poems. Well, the
Internet's good for that sort of
thing.

1:26:03.039 --> 1:26:04.839
Oh, I know.

1:26:04.879 --> 1:26:07.119
I go to a lot of funerals, don't I?

1:26:07.159 --> 1:26:09.159
Occupational hazard.

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:16.479
I suppose you think I'm very
hard-hearted not visiting her in
hospital.

1:26:16.519 --> 1:26:19.600
That's not my business, love. She was
a difficult girl.

1:26:19.639 --> 1:26:21.239
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:23.600
And a lot of people loved her.

1:26:28.439 --> 1:26:30.800
I think Brian probably was a little
cruel.

1:26:32.479 --> 1:26:34.600
I was a girl. I didn't know any
better.

1:26:34.639 --> 1:26:38.879
But we were probably not as kind to
her as we could have been.

1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:42.560
He's paying for it now though.
(SCOFFS)

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:45.839
Not as much as his daughter paid,
love.

1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:11.639
They've taken him in for processing.

1:27:12.479 --> 1:27:15.159
This was someone's idea of the
future.

1:27:16.319 --> 1:27:18.319
New towns. New hope.

1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:23.600
Look, there's somewhere I need to be,
pet.

1:27:23.639 --> 1:27:26.200
