Can I come in, sir?

01:44.695 --> 01:47.892
I did knock, sir. Perhaps you didn't hear me.

01:48.065 --> 01:49.896
Your hot lemon, sir.

01:53.036 --> 01:58.668
Goddamn yellow fever. I've still got
that jowly flabby puffiness around my cheeks.

01:58.842 --> 02:01.970
Wasn't that there before your illness, sir?

02:02.679 --> 02:05.273
Yes, I'm sure it was because...

02:06.416 --> 02:08.213

- Enjoying it. Directives for you to sign, sir.

02:35.012 --> 02:40.473
I'm so sorry, but if I've got a record, I'll never
become an officer and command my own ship.

02:40.651 --> 02:43.245
That's what I long for - to be like you.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.911
Maybe thinner and in better condition,

02:46.089 --> 02:49.252
and, obviously, without your clogged arteries.

02:49.426 --> 02:52.554
That aside, you're the person I admire the most.

02:52.729 --> 02:57.325
- Another ambition achieved.
- You think I could become an officer one day?

02:58.902 --> 03:04.807
Look, it gives me no pleasure telling you this,
Rimmer, but you're just not officer material.

03:04.975 --> 03:10.038
- Not officer material, sir?
- Take my advice and redirect your energies.

- Rimmer's just leaving.
- I can't believe I've run into you again

03:38.141 --> 03:39.438
after all this time.

03:40.410 --> 03:43.470
The nanobots must have resurrected you, too.

03:43.647 --> 03:46.207
You look wonderful.

You made captain. You've done so well.

Your own ship. Wow! I've got goosebumps.

The photograph of your wife, sir, is it OK

04:01.131 --> 04:04.931
- Dismissed, Rimmer.
- Thank you. Nothing I can get you, ma'am?

He didn't see my good side. My guile, my

- What's that?
- A present to help cheer up Miss Kochanski.

06:54.938 --> 06:59.034
- A calendar?
- The other day, she looked at the old calendar

06:59.209 --> 07:03.236
and said it was the wrong time
of the month, so I got her a new one.

07:04.180 --> 07:07.411
I'll tell her - the calendar people
made a mistake,

07:07.584 --> 07:10.553
but let's leave this wrong month thing
behind us.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.521
Being grumpy and tearful about it
is getting it way out of proportion.

07:15.692 --> 07:18.559
A little word in your audio receiver.

07:20.664 --> 07:26.330
This happens to all women? They become cranky
and weird? You never see this in films or on TV.

07:26.503 --> 07:31.566

This is the biggest cover-up since Watergate!

07:31.741 --> 07:36.269
It's no big deal. I'll tell you what to do

Oh, yeah. Sometimes, he's so cute,
I could just eat him.

08:25.395 --> 08:30.697

embarrass myself. Come on, then, open it!

17:52.862 --> 17:54.625
I'm stealing your fries...

17:54.797 --> 17:56.788
...fat boy (!)

18:14.617 --> 18:17.211
Mmm... This is good.

18:18.321 --> 18:19.652
Tasty!

18:19.822 --> 18:26.819
There ain't no one more bad-ass evil than me
in the whole of hell.

18:26.996 --> 18:30.159
What makes you think you can dis me and live?

18:30.333 --> 18:33.461
'Cause things are changing round here.

18:33.636 --> 18:36.799
From now on, marshmallow ass,

18:36.973 --> 18:38.964
you're my bitch.

18:41.277 --> 18:43.040
Your what?

18:43.212 --> 18:47.876
B-l-H. Bitch! That's what you look like,
that's what you are, understand?

18:51.654 --> 18:53.281
OK.

18:54.257 --> 18:55.747
What?

18:55.925 --> 18:59.088
Anyone who tough-talks me
gotta be a no-loading pug.

18:59.262 --> 19:02.959
You want me to be your bitch,
that's fine by me, sir!

19:03.132 --> 19:06.727
Are you sure you don't wanna
just hit me a couple of times?

19:06.902 --> 19:08.870
No, sir. I'm your bitch.

19:09.038 --> 19:16.035
From now on, I'm your jiggly-wiggly,
rollover, sweet patootie, honey-bun missy.

19:16.212 --> 19:18.146
I just wanna make you happy.

19:18.314 --> 19:20.214
Then hit me!

19:20.383 --> 19:24.843
And hurt my baby's kisser? Nothin' doin'!

19:27.423 --> 19:29.914
Damn!

19:47.677 --> 19:52.876
- We gotta be outta here by five o'clock.
- What's so special about five o'clock?

19:53.049 --> 19:56.314
Five o'clock's bed-bath time,
and I'm doing them!

20:05.127 --> 20:07.595
The microbe which destroyed the Hermes.

20:07.763 --> 20:10.129
- It's on Red Dwarf!
- How?

20:10.299 --> 20:16.465
The microbe's chameleonic, so it must have been
the escape pod - the one Talia arrived on.

20:16.639 --> 20:20.700
- We've got to go back and tell them.
- What about our escape?

20:20.876 --> 20:26.906
It could be days before they discover this. If
we go back now, they can work on an antidote.

20:27.083 --> 20:31.315
You're just acting all brave and manly
to impress her, aren't you?

20:31.487 --> 20:34.479
Dave's right. He's looking at the big picture.

20:34.657 --> 20:38.525
Yeah - the big picture involves you,
no clothes and a haystack.

20:39.161 --> 20:43.791
Red Dwarf is being devoured from within
by a corrosive micro-organism.

20:43.966 --> 20:47.424
We don't have enough craft
for everyone to be rescued,

20:47.603 --> 20:51.562
so most of you will be staying behind to die.

20:51.741 --> 20:55.233
There's an apology about that
in the internal mail.

21:07.623 --> 21:11.491
It's been created in a lab
and programmed not to destroy glass.

21:11.660 --> 21:14.754
So all we need
is a plutonium-powered greenhouse.

21:14.930 --> 21:19.867
We need an antidote that will neutralize
the corrosive negativity of the microbe.

21:20.035 --> 21:23.835
- Something with a corrosive positivity?
- Where do we get that?

21:24.006 --> 21:26.531
<i>There's nothing in "Yellow Pages".</i>

21:27.543 --> 21:32.003
A mirror universe where things
are diametrically opposite to this one.

21:32.181 --> 21:36.311
There, negative becomes positive
and a virus becomes an antidote.

21:43.926 --> 21:48.886
If the prism is flawed, the mirror universe
may be an imperfect version of our own.

21:49.064 --> 21:51.191
We won't know until we get there.

22:08.918 --> 22:11.352
It's overloaded. We've lost Mr Rimmer!

22:11.520 --> 22:15.354
- At last! Things are looking up.
- How long will it take to fix it?

22:15.524 --> 22:17.321
Best guess, about 20 minutes.

22:29.572 --> 22:32.336
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

22:42.685 --> 22:46.553
Can I come in, sir? I did knock.
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

22:48.491 --> 22:51.119
Here's your hot lemon, sir.

22:53.095 --> 22:55.188
Thank you, um...

22:55.364 --> 22:57.389
...Private Nobody.

22:57.566 --> 23:00.364
A few directives to sign, sir.

23:00.536 --> 23:02.367
Of course, laddie.

23:04.940 --> 23:08.398
A free pardon exonerating you from all crimes?

23:10.012 --> 23:13.607
Ooh! I don't know
how that got in there, sir. I...

23:13.782 --> 23:16.410
Want to be an officer, don't you, laddie?

23:17.052 --> 23:21.079
Oh, sir. Could I one day? Could I be?

23:22.758 --> 23:25.249
No, I don't think you could.

23:29.765 --> 23:33.394
Of course - it's a mirror universe.
Everything's opposite.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.544
My God!

23:50.719 --> 23:53.347
This is gonna take some getting used to.

23:55.424 --> 23:59.121
They said it was OK to drop by.
You look wonderful.

23:59.295 --> 24:01.286
So do you.

24:01.463 --> 24:04.432
- That'll be all, Shambles.
- Yes, sir.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.559
You made captain. You've done so well.

24:08.737 --> 24:12.605
Your own ship. Wow! I've got goosebumps.

24:12.775 --> 24:14.902
So have I.

24:15.077 --> 24:17.068
Let me kiss you.

24:18.380 --> 24:20.405
(MUFFLED PROTEST)

24:20.583 --> 24:22.016
What are you doing?

24:22.184 --> 24:26.143
I'm giving you a big wet snog
with oodles of Tommy Tongue.

24:27.523 --> 24:30.117
But I'm your sister.

24:39.034 --> 24:43.027
Yes, of course,
but I was really pleased to see you.

24:43.205 --> 24:46.606
- I, um...
- You French kissed me.

24:46.775 --> 24:50.677
No, it was nearer Antwerp. I Belgian kissed you.

24:50.846 --> 24:52.837
I...

24:53.015 --> 24:55.006
I've been really ill.

24:55.184 --> 24:57.175
You're the captain's sister?

25:01.657 --> 25:04.285
Oh, my God! What a terrible dream!

25:04.460 --> 25:10.524
Hi, sis. It's Arnie, your bro. Get your big old
lumpy bum down here and give us a big hug!

25:10.699 --> 25:12.667
Captain Rimmer,

25:12.835 --> 25:14.996
I am Sister Talia Garrett.

25:17.940 --> 25:21.501
Your personal spiritual adviser.

25:21.677 --> 25:23.167
(SHE SOBS)

25:23.345 --> 25:25.813
Sister whoever you are...

25:25.981 --> 25:28.006
Oh, smeg!

25:32.921 --> 25:34.252
Excuse me.

25:34.423 --> 25:38.484
- Yes?
- Could you tell me what this is?

25:38.661 --> 25:43.257
You'll need to ask the professor.
He does the stupid, brainbox-type stuff.

25:45.034 --> 25:47.025
Somebody call?

25:48.137 --> 25:50.435
- Professor?
- Yes, Captain?

25:50.606 --> 25:53.541
Perhaps you could help me. What's this?

25:57.379 --> 26:00.109
- It's an alkaline.
- What's it called?

26:00.282 --> 26:06.243
Sessyum-frankilithic-mixi-alibilium-rixi-dixi
doxy-dexy-droxide. You look surprised.

26:06.422 --> 26:10.381
I never thought I'd hear you say that.
Can you write it down for me?

26:10.559 --> 26:13.756
Certainly. Can I have
an extremely long piece of paper, dear?

26:15.197 --> 26:18.257
The antidote! I did it!

26:18.434 --> 26:21.767

26:24.239 --> 26:27.231

26:55.604 --> 26:57.595

26:57.773 --> 26:59.764
To make up a formula.

26:59.942 --> 27:04.402

27:04.580 --> 27:09.415

27:10.486 --> 27:11.885
Smeg! You're right.

27:16.058 --> 27:18.424
- How?
- <i>Remember that chocolate bar?</i>

27:18.594 --> 27:21.188
<i>You could pay me back before you snuff it.</i>

27:21.363 --> 27:23.354
How's that a happy ending?

27:23.532 --> 27:27.059
<i>It's a happy ending for me.</i>
<i>At least my totals will tally.</i>
