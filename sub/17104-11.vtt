09:10.360 --> 09:11.120
Ow!

09:11.159 --> 09:13.519
-Three times.

09:13.559 --> 09:17.320
Well, I guess I'm going to look
after you lovely girls.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.519
PAIGE (OFFSCREEN): [chuckles]

09:24.279 --> 09:25.840
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): So after
the Ranger, we go over to the

09:25.879 --> 09:29.039
Dodgems, depending on
how we do with time.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.159
If we make a plan, we'll be
able to maximize the day.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.480
-I want to stand in the middle,
spin around and go on

09:35.519 --> 09:37.120
whatever ride I point out.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.440
-Yeah.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.320
-Just fight the urge to control
everything, Abigail.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.120
-Look, it's the mouth.

09:45.159 --> 09:46.159
Whoo!

09:46.200 --> 09:46.799
PAIGE (OFFSCREEN): We're
nearly there!

09:46.840 --> 09:48.000
We're nearly there!

09:48.039 --> 09:48.519
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Oh, look
at all the rides.

09:48.559 --> 09:49.519
How exciting!

09:49.559 --> 09:50.159
PAIGE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
I want to go

09:50.200 --> 09:51.519
on the Ferris Wheel.

09:51.559 --> 09:53.679
DANA (OFFSCREEN): This is good,
except for that picture.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.440
[giggles]

09:58.480 --> 09:59.399
Uh, hi!

09:59.440 --> 10:01.279
You must be Tara.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.240
-Hi.

10:02.279 --> 10:03.399
-All warmed up?

10:03.440 --> 10:05.279
-Um, yeah, yeah, of course.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.799
-Great.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.039
OK, so I don't want to get too
literal, but this pace is kind

10:10.080 --> 10:11.600
of it's about a girl
who's caught

10:11.639 --> 10:13.120
between her two selves--

10:13.159 --> 10:15.200
who she is now and who
she is going to be.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.720
-And, uh, tell me why
did you pick Tara?

10:16.759 --> 10:19.399
-Well, she's a first-year, so
technically we are limited to

10:19.440 --> 10:20.399
what we can do.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.799
No offense.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.759
But what she's got is this
quality, just like the girl.

10:24.799 --> 10:27.320
I mean, when she's dancing,
she's not

10:27.360 --> 10:28.399
self-conscious about anything.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.320
She's free.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.279
DANA (OFFSCREEN): OK, good.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.320
Well, let's get started.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.240
-Yay!

10:35.279 --> 10:37.759
-Whoa, ha-ha, want some?

10:37.799 --> 10:39.120
-No, I'm, uh.

10:39.159 --> 10:40.320
-[giggles]

10:40.360 --> 10:41.679
-We're going to go there.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.639
-[shrieks]

10:42.679 --> 10:44.559
-Oh!

10:44.600 --> 10:45.480
[dings]

10:45.519 --> 10:48.399
-Whoa!

10:48.440 --> 10:49.759
-I'm the king of the world!

10:49.799 --> 10:50.720
-Two, one!

10:50.759 --> 10:52.639
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Go, Paige!

10:52.679 --> 10:53.360
PAIGE (OFFSCREEN): Whoa!

10:53.399 --> 10:56.159
Come on, Abigail!

10:56.200 --> 10:57.519
Ready, Abigail?

10:57.559 --> 10:58.080
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Go on!

10:58.120 --> 10:59.279
Oop, yeah!

11:02.519 --> 11:03.480
-Come along, Sammy.

11:03.519 --> 11:04.440
-We're coming.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.399
-Sammy!

11:06.440 --> 11:08.600
-Hey, do you have-- do you mind
sitting next to Paige on

11:08.639 --> 11:09.480
the next ride?

11:09.519 --> 11:10.799
-Why?

11:10.840 --> 11:12.039
You're not going to declare
your love for Abigail?

11:12.080 --> 11:13.159
Because my stomach's already
fragile over that.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.799
-No, it's, um, it's, uh,
because of Paige.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.320
-What?

11:17.360 --> 11:19.279
-She might have a little crush
on me or something.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.639
-[laughs]

11:20.679 --> 11:21.600
-Dude, get over yourself.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.399
-She's been flirting with me.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.360
-She's 11!

11:24.399 --> 11:27.639
[chuckles]

11:27.679 --> 11:29.639
[music playing]

11:36.840 --> 11:38.159
-What do you think?

11:38.200 --> 11:41.120
I mean, we can go from renverse
to pas de bourree and

11:41.159 --> 11:42.639
then the attitude turns.

11:42.679 --> 11:43.799
It might make it more fluid.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.320
-Mm-hm.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.759
What does Tara think?

11:47.799 --> 11:49.279
-Oop, sorry, did you--

11:49.320 --> 11:51.039
-Renverse into pas de bourree
and then into

11:51.080 --> 11:51.639
the attitude turns.

11:51.679 --> 11:52.600
Got it.

11:52.639 --> 11:53.679
-Perfect.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.200
[music playing]

12:06.240 --> 12:07.720
-Wait.

12:07.759 --> 12:09.039
You're not really feeling
this, are you?

12:09.080 --> 12:10.360
-Well, um--

12:10.399 --> 12:11.679
-Feel free to talk to me.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.440
This isn't class.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.799
It's the attitude turns.

12:14.840 --> 12:18.799
Maybe-- maybe I can do a pose
instead of a chasse.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.200
-Really?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.480
I can't see that working.

12:22.519 --> 12:23.559
-You know, it might.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.399
Why doesn't Tara do that?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.840
-Oh, OK, good idea.

12:27.879 --> 12:28.480
Sure.

12:28.519 --> 12:30.759
[music playing]

12:33.720 --> 12:36.200
-It's a matter of getting
perfect timing.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.320
[shrieks]

12:40.360 --> 12:40.840
-Whoo!

12:40.879 --> 12:42.080
-"Virtual hug."

12:42.120 --> 12:43.080
-Back at you!

12:43.120 --> 12:45.480
[both giggle]

12:45.519 --> 12:47.039
-Hey, Sammy, look at this!

12:47.080 --> 12:49.039
-Yeah, it's a dog, isn't it?

12:51.879 --> 12:53.840
Apparently, I'm due for
a growth spurt.

12:53.879 --> 12:54.799
-Hey, Sammy.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
-Yeah?

12:55.879 --> 12:57.399
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Guys,
check this out.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.639
Oh, look, look, there's
two of me.

13:06.679 --> 13:08.720
-What are you looking
at, Abigail?

13:08.759 --> 13:10.080
-Nothing.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.159
-OK, guys, who wants
fairy floss again?

13:14.200 --> 13:14.600
PAIGE (OFFSCREEN): Me!

13:14.639 --> 13:15.799
[giggles]

13:22.840 --> 13:23.360
-There she is.

13:23.399 --> 13:23.799
Dana!

13:23.840 --> 13:26.159
Over here.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.399
Oh, she's busy.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.240
She's incredible, isn't she?

13:29.279 --> 13:31.480
-Uh-huh.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.200
So, you know, with your
choreography, how you, like,

13:33.240 --> 13:35.120
plan everything out
in advance?

13:35.159 --> 13:37.039
-Yeah?

13:37.080 --> 13:40.679
-I used to think that if I do
that with my life, like

13:40.720 --> 13:43.440
visualize every moment, I could
make it happen the way I

13:43.480 --> 13:44.440
wanted it to--

13:44.480 --> 13:45.799
-Are we talking specifics?

13:45.840 --> 13:48.279
Or--

13:48.320 --> 13:53.519
-I guess, it's like having
a crush on someone.

13:53.559 --> 13:57.080
You imagine every moment, you
end up chasing around some

13:57.120 --> 14:01.480
poor guy because you just
don't understand how it

14:01.519 --> 14:05.080
doesn't happen the way it
happens in your head.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.799
-Well, at least, it's
honest-- putting how

14:06.840 --> 14:08.200
you feel out there.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.600
Can't say that about
a lot of people.

14:09.639 --> 14:12.440
-Ah, yeah, it's a personality
winner.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.080
-Hey, I'm sorry if my head's
all messed up today.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.759
It's just so rare that you
can actually talk to

14:17.799 --> 14:18.759
someone, you know?

14:18.799 --> 14:21.639
Like we're on the same level?

14:21.679 --> 14:22.440
-Yeah.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.759
Yeah, it is.

14:24.799 --> 14:28.320
-She's incredible, isn't she?

14:28.360 --> 14:29.799
-Yeah, she's perfect.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.679
-Want some?

14:38.720 --> 14:39.799
-No, no, thanks.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.840
-Go on.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.200
-No, it's all right.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.279
-He doesn't want any, Paige.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.600
It's full of processed sugars.

14:44.639 --> 14:46.320
If you don't want to go back
to being a pudge, you

14:46.360 --> 14:47.399
shouldn't have any either.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.080
-Abigail, it's-- it's fine.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.200
-Don't be polite.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.159
She's been acting
inappropriately all day.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.159
-Ooh, big word.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.200
You know, Dad used to call
Abigail a night light because

14:57.240 --> 14:58.360
she's not too bright.

14:58.399 --> 14:59.840
-Ooh.

14:59.879 --> 15:02.159
-It's nauseating watching an
11-year-old behave like that.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.159
-And then once, she brought us
a note to get out of sport.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.480
And she signed it, "Abigail's
mother."

15:07.519 --> 15:09.440
-Ah, I remember that.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.840
That was a work of
pure genius, Abs.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.159
-Seven, eight, and--

15:16.200 --> 15:20.159
[music playing]

15:20.200 --> 15:24.159
-Stop showing me the steps.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.519
Relax your upper body.

15:25.559 --> 15:26.600
That's still too stiff!

15:26.639 --> 15:27.440
-I'm sorry.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.080
I can't do what you're asking.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.159
-Hang on a second.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.480
What's with you today?

15:34.519 --> 15:36.039
You're like a robot out there.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.519
-I know I'm trying.

15:37.559 --> 15:38.200
-To what?

15:38.240 --> 15:39.799
Prove a point?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.840
I cast you for a reason.

15:41.879 --> 15:44.120
We cannot just keep
going over this.

15:44.159 --> 15:46.480
-I said I'm trying.

15:46.519 --> 15:49.639
-Um, guys, is-- is
there a problem?

15:49.679 --> 15:50.559
-No.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.159
No problem.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.360
Right, Tara?

15:54.559 --> 15:55.440
Sorry about that.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.639
Going again.

15:57.679 --> 15:59.559
[music playing]

16:03.440 --> 16:05.399
-Making a complete
fool of yourself.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.320
-I am just trying to have
a good holiday.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.639
-Why do you have to
be so annoying?

16:09.679 --> 16:10.919
-OK, you know what?

16:10.960 --> 16:13.559
Um, we're going to meet you
back at the academy.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.639
-OK, yeah.

16:14.679 --> 16:15.799
-I put a lot of time
I don't have into

16:15.840 --> 16:16.600
planning this weekend.

16:16.639 --> 16:17.360
You've completely ruined it.

16:17.399 --> 16:18.600
-Big deal.

16:18.639 --> 16:20.200
You've ruined my whole life.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.639
We can't go to holidays because
Abigail has a concert.

16:22.679 --> 16:24.679
No chocolate ice cream in the
freezer because Abigail is on

16:24.720 --> 16:25.759
a diet.

16:25.799 --> 16:27.240
-Like anyone eats chocolate
ice cream.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.120
-Mom moved out to Sydney to be
near you, and you never even

16:29.159 --> 16:30.200
visit.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.399
-I'm at the National
Academy of Dance.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.720
I have classes every day.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.320
-Well, why is it always
about you?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.759
-Because you're not special.

16:35.799 --> 16:38.240
You're just a little girl,
overtired, overstimulated, and

16:38.279 --> 16:39.480
chock-full of preservatives.

16:39.519 --> 16:41.679
-Yeah, well, just as long
as I'm not like you!

16:54.639 --> 16:57.159
-Paige?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.320
Paige!

17:00.519 --> 17:03.759
Excuse me, did you see
where my sister went?

17:03.799 --> 17:05.480
Look, I know you're not
actually a statue.

17:08.519 --> 17:09.640
Hrmph!

17:12.440 --> 17:13.598
Paige!

17:23.279 --> 17:24.240
[phone rings]

17:24.279 --> 17:26.240
-Abigail?

17:26.279 --> 17:27.000
-Paige is gone.

17:27.039 --> 17:28.240
I can't find her anywhere.

17:28.279 --> 17:29.640
I turned around,
and she's gone.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.160
-OK, uh, we're on our way
back to the academy now.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.559
I'm sure she'll just
go back there.

17:33.599 --> 17:34.799
-Anything can happen.

17:34.839 --> 17:36.799
-I'll call you if we find
her, don't worry.

17:36.839 --> 17:37.599
Page is really smart.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.519
-Unlike me, you mean?

17:38.559 --> 17:39.759
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Abigail!

17:49.200 --> 17:49.799
-Again.

17:49.839 --> 17:50.599
-Wait.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.400
Can I suggest something?

17:52.440 --> 17:53.400
-Please.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.559
-Look, Tara's an instinctive
dancer.

17:55.599 --> 17:58.079
And you have the foundations
of a good pace.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.799
We just need to stop
micromanaging.

18:01.839 --> 18:03.799
-So it's my fault.

18:03.839 --> 18:06.640
-It doesn't always help
to be dictatorial.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.759
-Dictatorial?

18:07.799 --> 18:09.799
-Uh, Tara, how are
you feeling?

18:09.839 --> 18:11.359
-I could do with a break.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.799
-Right, let's break.

18:18.799 --> 18:20.559
-"Dictatorial" is a bit harsh.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.640
-Maybe.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.799
Look, what you're doing
is not working.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.279
That poor girl is dancing
her heart out for you.

18:28.319 --> 18:28.799
-Tara?

18:28.839 --> 18:30.160
She'll be fine.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.200
Besides, I'm sure it's always
tense like this before a

18:33.240 --> 18:34.200
breakthrough.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.200
-Did you hear anything
I just said?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.559
I've--

18:37.599 --> 18:39.559
I can't work out if it's
confidence or arrogance you're

18:39.599 --> 18:41.759
throwing at me.

18:41.799 --> 18:43.759
-What do you want it to be?

18:43.799 --> 18:45.039
-I'm sorry?

18:45.079 --> 18:46.680
-Confidence or arrogance?

18:46.720 --> 18:49.079
Maybe we should work
it out over dinner?

18:49.119 --> 18:50.279
-What?

18:50.319 --> 18:52.319
-Why, there's obviously
something between us.

18:52.359 --> 18:53.799
-Dude, you're 17!

18:53.839 --> 18:54.440
-18.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.880
-[chuckles]

18:55.920 --> 18:59.200
Which is why I'm going to
overlook the fact that you're

18:59.240 --> 19:01.640
out of line and that
I just gave up my

19:01.680 --> 19:03.480
Saturday to be your mentor.

19:03.519 --> 19:04.319
-And I appreciate that.

19:04.359 --> 19:04.799
I--

19:04.839 --> 19:05.400
I really do.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.759
But, uh, I was--

19:06.799 --> 19:08.480
-Now, you have, obviously,
got all this figured out.

19:08.519 --> 19:09.319
So I'm--

19:09.359 --> 19:10.119
I'm going to leave you to it.

19:18.079 --> 19:20.559
-Is Sammy the best dancer
at the school?

19:20.599 --> 19:21.480
-Yes.

19:21.519 --> 19:22.720
In the world, actually.

19:22.759 --> 19:24.160
-I thought so.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.799
Does he have a girlfriend?

19:25.839 --> 19:28.799
-Look, shouldn't you be
in Abigail's room?

19:28.839 --> 19:30.839
-Do you want to roll first?

19:30.880 --> 19:33.799
-Uh, no, I don't want to play.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.799
-No, here she is.

19:34.839 --> 19:36.200
Paige, what are you
doing here?

19:36.240 --> 19:37.640
-Hey, Sammy, you want to play?

19:37.680 --> 19:39.720
-Paige, you can't just
run off like that.

19:39.759 --> 19:41.680
Abigail is out there,
eating her own hair.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.720
-No way!

19:42.759 --> 19:44.079
She's too worried about
the fat count.

19:44.119 --> 19:45.160
-Yeah, Paige, look.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.240
You can't stay here,
so we have to go.

19:46.279 --> 19:47.640
-One game or I'm
going nowhere.

19:47.680 --> 19:48.640
KAT (OFFSCREEN): [sighs]

19:48.680 --> 19:49.400
-All right.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.400
I'm going to call Abigail.

19:53.839 --> 19:55.200
[phone rings]

19:58.359 --> 20:00.319
-Well, this is cozy.

20:00.359 --> 20:01.440
So sorry to interrupt.

20:01.480 --> 20:02.160
-No, no, no.

20:02.200 --> 20:02.839
We just got here.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.799
Abigail!

20:04.839 --> 20:06.200
-Paige.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.480
-You and Kat planned that?

20:21.519 --> 20:24.160
Turn Abigail into a freaked
out, screaming mess?

20:24.200 --> 20:25.200
-We didn't plan anything.

20:25.240 --> 20:25.759
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
Yes, you did.

20:25.799 --> 20:26.480
You know what?

20:26.519 --> 20:28.559
You did me a favor.

20:28.599 --> 20:30.160
Now, I know you all hate me.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.279
-Nobody hates you.

20:31.319 --> 20:35.480
-Go barnacle yourself
to Kat, Paige.

20:35.519 --> 20:37.279
-Sammy really likes you.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.240
And you treat him like dirt.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.759
Mom and Dad love you so much
that we're all split between

20:41.799 --> 20:44.240
two cities.

20:44.279 --> 20:46.640
-Paige, get out.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.200
-Even I do.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.559
Only you hate me.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.079
-I usually hate weekends, but
I was really looking forward

20:56.119 --> 20:57.279
to this one.

21:09.359 --> 21:10.759
-I made it for you.

21:25.759 --> 21:29.079
Actual hug?

21:29.119 --> 21:30.279
-[sniffs]

21:41.319 --> 21:42.480
[sobs]

21:51.720 --> 21:52.559
-Do you want me to start?

21:52.599 --> 21:53.680
Or should I just
wait for Dana?

21:53.720 --> 21:57.279
-Dana and I had artistic
differences.

21:57.319 --> 21:59.839
Look, you don't seem to want
to be here either, so I can

21:59.880 --> 22:01.559
get another dancer.

22:01.599 --> 22:06.160
-Wow, has the brilliant Ethan
Karamakov been rejected?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.799
That's got to hurt.

22:07.839 --> 22:10.480
-Never knew you were
quite so sarcastic.

22:10.519 --> 22:12.599
-When have you ever actually
taken the time

22:12.640 --> 22:14.640
to get to know me?

22:14.680 --> 22:16.039
I don't understand, why
did you pick me

22:16.079 --> 22:18.319
in the first place?

22:18.359 --> 22:20.319
-It was when you were doing that
dance with the ribbon.

22:20.359 --> 22:21.200
You were, um--

22:21.240 --> 22:23.079
---a kid?

22:23.119 --> 22:24.200
Yeah, I got it.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.039
-No.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.400
You were inspiring.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.319
Look, go, stay, do whatever
you want to do.

22:33.359 --> 22:35.160
TARA NARRATING: The best part
about my sixth birthday party

22:35.200 --> 22:37.160
was when it rained.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.799
Even though it ruined my new
dress, even though it made the

22:39.839 --> 22:43.720
pony spook and bolt right into
the cake, I remember farmers

22:43.759 --> 22:47.359
crying, the whole town
celebrating, all of us playing

22:47.400 --> 22:49.079
in the mud.

22:49.119 --> 22:52.640
And my party became famous after
that as the one that

22:52.680 --> 22:54.319
broke the drought.

22:54.359 --> 22:55.759
It wasn't what I'd imagined.

22:55.799 --> 22:57.559

22:57.599 --> 22:58.519
TARA NARRATING: It was better.

22:58.559 --> 23:00.440
[music playing]

23:42.200 --> 23:43.680
-That was perfect.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.799
I knew you could do it.

23:45.839 --> 23:47.799
