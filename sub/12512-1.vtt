01:53.530 --> 01:55.259
Have a try at it.

02:03.106 --> 02:05.666
Coo, governor, that was a slide.

02:05.775 --> 02:07.402
- It was good, wasn't it?
- I should say.

02:07.477 --> 02:09.445
You beat the record, that's what you did.

02:09.512 --> 02:10.740
Did I, now?

02:11.848 --> 02:13.179
Look at Albert.

02:14.150 --> 02:15.549
He fell!

02:17.720 --> 02:20.518
- Don't you like sliding, son?
- Yes, sir. It's great sport.

02:20.590 --> 02:22.319
Come on then. Try and beat my record.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.156
No, thank you, governor.
I'm not very good at running.

02:31.301 --> 02:33.997
Here. Get up on my back.
We'll show them how to slide.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.435
Thank you, sir.

02:35.772 --> 02:38.468
- What's your name, youngster?
- Tim, sir. Thank you, sir.

02:38.541 --> 02:41.203
- Well, come on, Tim. Here we go.
- Thank you.

02:41.277 --> 02:43.711
We'll really do this slide.
We'll make a record together.

02:43.780 --> 02:44.940
Here we go now!

02:45.181 --> 02:46.671
Hold tight.

02:47.951 --> 02:50.886
There we are. Wasn't that lovely?

02:50.954 --> 02:54.355
It was wonderful.
It made my stomach all wobbly-like.

02:55.091 --> 02:58.822
- Yes. We're a team, that's what we are.
- I don't suppose you ever fall down.

02:58.895 --> 03:01.022
- Like Albert.
- Fall down?

03:01.164 --> 03:03.564
Who, me? No.

03:07.871 --> 03:09.634
- Well, sir?
- I am sorry, governor.

03:09.706 --> 03:10.764
I didn't mean to hit you, sir.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.502
Please don't be angry with him, sir.
He's my brother.

03:13.576 --> 03:15.840
In that case,
I've only one reason to be angry.

03:15.912 --> 03:17.174
He broke my record.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.241
- What's your name?
- Cratchit, sir. Peter Cratchit.

03:20.316 --> 03:21.613
He's my brother, Tim Cratchit.

03:21.684 --> 03:24.084
- Not Bob Cratchit's sons?
- Why, yes, sir.

03:24.587 --> 03:25.781
I know your father well.

03:25.855 --> 03:28.688
In truth, I was on my way
to his place of work when we met.

03:28.925 --> 03:30.893
Maybe he'll take the message for us, Pete.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.258
As you'll be seeing him, sir,
you might do me the favor...

03:33.329 --> 03:35.889
of giving him this list of things
my mother wants him to fetch.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.899
- Certainly.
- It's very nice of you to do that, sir.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.696
Not a bit of it, Peter.
I'm more than willing.

03:39.769 --> 03:40.963
Well, that is jolly.

03:41.037 --> 03:44.336
Don't you two lads want to see
your father? And on Christmas Eve, too?

03:44.407 --> 03:46.898
It ain't that we don't want to see
our own father, sir.

03:46.976 --> 03:50.537
It's the man our father works for
we don't want to see. Mr. Scrooge.

03:50.613 --> 03:52.945
I don't think he's very fond
of small boys, sir.

03:53.016 --> 03:56.383
Yes. I understand.
You see, I knew Mr. Scrooge...

03:56.452 --> 03:58.784
when I was a small boy. He's my uncle.

04:27.483 --> 04:28.472
Come on now, Bob.

04:28.551 --> 04:30.212
Aren't you going to wish me
a merry Christmas?

04:30.286 --> 04:33.084
Mr. Fred, I am sorry. When you came in
and stood there like that...

04:33.156 --> 04:35.147
I thought it was your uncle.
A merry Christmas, sir.

04:35.224 --> 04:37.818
A merry Christmas to you, Bob,
and to your family.

04:39.395 --> 04:41.795
I've already paid my respects
to part of your brood.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.859
Peter and Tim, their names were.

04:43.933 --> 04:46.026
They asked me to give you this list
from their mother.

04:46.102 --> 04:48.366
Thank you. They shouldn't have made it
an errand for you.

04:48.438 --> 04:49.905
I was pleased to do it.

04:50.239 --> 04:51.365
It's cold in here.

04:51.441 --> 04:53.602
You think we could have some coal
on the fire?

04:54.077 --> 04:56.136
Oh, yes.
It's against the regulations, isn't it?

04:56.212 --> 04:58.578
Mr. Scrooge doesn't like to waste coal, sir.

04:58.681 --> 05:01.115
I foresaw that and provided for it.

05:01.184 --> 05:03.209
This'll make the place less bleak.

05:03.286 --> 05:06.312
- What might that be?
- It's a wine bottle.

05:06.823 --> 05:10.054
A cheering, warming, goodly wine.
A wine that'll race through your veins...

05:10.126 --> 05:13.892
with little torches. It's port, Bob.
The fifth essence of the Christmas spirit.

05:14.998 --> 05:16.465
But we haven't got a glass.

05:16.532 --> 05:18.557
I'll get one from Mr. Scrooge's office.

05:29.045 --> 05:30.910
- What is this?
- Cough medicine.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.470
Yeah, I thought so.

05:33.850 --> 05:35.408
We will.

05:35.485 --> 05:38.613
- We will have some more coal.
- Good man, Bob.

05:45.461 --> 05:48.487
Come on now, Bob.
Let's drink a loving cup. You sweeten it.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.963
- Another merry Christmas, Mr. Fred.
- Yes.

05:58.074 --> 06:00.406
A merry Christmas to you, Uncle.
God save you.

06:00.476 --> 06:01.465
Humbug!

06:01.544 --> 06:04.809
Christmas, humbug?
Uncle, I'm sure you don't mean that.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.974
Humbug I said, and humbug I mean.

06:07.550 --> 06:10.610
Merry Christmas.
What right have you to be merry?

06:10.686 --> 06:13.154
- You're poor enough.
- What right have you to be dismal?

06:13.222 --> 06:15.053
- You're rich enough.
- Humbug.

06:15.558 --> 06:16.923
Now, Uncle, don't be cross.

06:16.993 --> 06:20.053
What else can I be
when I live in such a world of fools?

06:20.296 --> 06:21.888
Merry Christmas.

06:22.031 --> 06:25.467
What's Christmastime, but a time
for paying bills without money?

06:25.535 --> 06:29.198
A time for finding yourself a year older
and not an hour richer.

06:29.539 --> 06:32.975
If I could work my will, every idiot
that goes about with "merry Christmas"...

06:33.042 --> 06:35.533
on his lips should be boiled
with his own pudding...

06:35.611 --> 06:37.841
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

06:37.914 --> 06:39.438
- Uncle!
- Nephew!

06:39.982 --> 06:42.849
Keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.311
- But you don't keep it.
- Let me leave it alone then.

06:46.389 --> 06:48.050
Much good it has ever done you.

06:49.425 --> 06:52.223
Uncle, there are many things
which have made me happy.

06:52.428 --> 06:55.625
Things which have never
fattened my purse by even that much.

06:56.099 --> 06:57.862
Christmas is one of these.

06:58.468 --> 07:01.096
I've always looked on Christmas
as a good time...

07:01.871 --> 07:04.704
a kind, charitable, forgiving, pleasant time.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.071
It's the only time
when people open their hearts freely.

07:08.311 --> 07:10.643
The only time
when men and women seem to realize...

07:10.713 --> 07:13.580
that all human beings
are really members of the same family.

07:13.916 --> 07:15.850
And that being members
of the same family...

07:15.918 --> 07:18.887
they owe each other
some measure of warmth and solace.

07:20.256 --> 07:24.556
And therefore, Uncle, though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pockets...

07:24.627 --> 07:28.063
I believe that it has done me good,
and will do me good.

07:28.131 --> 07:29.689
And I say, God bless it!

07:35.338 --> 07:37.169
Let me hear another sound from you...

07:37.240 --> 07:40.038
and you'll keep Christmas
by losing your situation.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.748
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.

07:48.818 --> 07:52.117
- I wonder you don't go into Parliament.
- Uncle, don't be angry.

07:52.188 --> 07:55.089
Come now. Come and dine
with Bess and me tomorrow.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.022
- Bess?
- Yes. Elizabeth, my fiancee.

07:58.127 --> 08:01.187
I'm dining with her people,
I'm sure they'd welcome a visit from you.

08:01.264 --> 08:03.164
- So you're engaged?
- Yes.

08:03.332 --> 08:04.799
May I ask why?

08:06.936 --> 08:09.905
- Because I fell in love.
- Because you fell in love.

08:10.606 --> 08:12.073
You intend to marry?

08:12.575 --> 08:14.270
As soon as I'm earning enough money.

08:16.379 --> 08:18.108
Has she tried her relatives?

08:19.849 --> 08:24.183
- That wasn't the reason for my visit.
- Good afternoon.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.621
Uncle, I ask nothing from you.
I want nothing from you.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.920
There's no reason
why we should be enemies.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.220
Good afternoon.

08:31.294 --> 08:34.229
Uncle, I made this visit
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep...

08:34.297 --> 08:38.232
my Christmas spirit to the last.
And so, Uncle, a merry Christmas.

08:38.301 --> 08:40.394
- Good afternoon.
- And a happy new year.

08:40.469 --> 08:41.765
Good afternoon!

08:46.509 --> 08:48.204
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.303
Thank you, sir. A merry Christmas to you
and to your wife-to-be.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.472
Thank you.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.450
- A merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.581
- And the same to you, sirs.
- Thank you.

09:01.657 --> 09:03.318
- Scrooge and Marley's, I believe.
- Yes, sir.

09:03.392 --> 09:05.223
I have the pleasure
of addressing Mr. Marley?

09:05.294 --> 09:06.852
- No, sir.
- Then you're Mr. Scrooge.

09:06.929 --> 09:09.090
- No.
- My name is Scrooge.

09:09.832 --> 09:12.665
- And my name is Twill.
- And mine is Rummidge.

09:13.769 --> 09:14.861
And Mr. Marley?

09:14.937 --> 09:16.905
Mr. Marley's been dead these seven years.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.739
- He died seven years ago this very night.
- On Christmas Eve?

09:22.245 --> 09:23.803
As good a time as any.

09:23.879 --> 09:27.337
We have no doubt that Mr. Marley's
liberality is well represented...

09:27.416 --> 09:29.111
by his surviving partner.

09:29.185 --> 09:31.551
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge...

09:31.621 --> 09:34.818
it is more than usually desirable
that some slight provision be made...

09:34.890 --> 09:36.517
for the poor and destitute.

09:36.592 --> 09:40.221
Many thousands are in want, sir,
in need of common necessaries.

09:40.730 --> 09:44.359
Hundreds of thousands are in want
of common comforts, sir.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.663
- Are there no prisons?
- Plenty of prisons.

09:47.937 --> 09:50.531
And the workhouses,
are they still in operation?

09:50.606 --> 09:53.336
They are. Though I wish with all my heart
they were not.

09:53.409 --> 09:56.469
I was afraid from what you said at first
that something had occurred...

09:56.545 --> 09:57.978
to stop them in their useful course.

09:58.047 --> 10:01.312
Under the impression these places
can scarcely furnish Christmas cheer...

10:01.384 --> 10:03.477
for the mind and body of the multitude...

10:03.686 --> 10:08.055
a few of us have endeavored to form
a fund for the poor, to buy them food...

10:08.124 --> 10:10.251
and drink, and means of warmth.

10:10.726 --> 10:12.591
What can I put you down for, sir?

10:12.662 --> 10:13.651
Nothing.

10:14.897 --> 10:16.660
You wish to be anonymous?

10:16.732 --> 10:18.529
I wish to be left alone.

10:18.601 --> 10:21.331
Since you asked me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer.

10:21.404 --> 10:24.931
I help to support the institutions
I mentioned. They cost enough...

10:25.007 --> 10:27.134
and those who are badly off
must go there.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.007
Many can't go there,
and many would rather die.

10:30.146 --> 10:34.480
If they'd rather die, they'd better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.108
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

10:41.223 --> 10:44.056
In that case, we must apologize
for interrupting you, sir.

10:49.165 --> 10:50.189
Humbug!

11:33.509 --> 11:35.739
You keep close watch on the closing hour.

11:35.811 --> 11:38.405
- It's half an hour past, sir.
- Then close up.

11:38.481 --> 11:39.470
Thank you, sir.

11:39.548 --> 11:42.381
Don't work overtime.
You might make something of yourself.

11:45.988 --> 11:49.253
- You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?
- Lf it's quite convenient, sir.

11:49.325 --> 11:51.156
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.

11:51.227 --> 11:54.560
If I was to stop half a crown for it,
you'd consider yourself ill-used...

11:54.630 --> 11:55.688
I'll be bound.

11:55.765 --> 11:57.164
It's only once a year, sir.

11:57.233 --> 12:00.828
A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

12:00.903 --> 12:03.736
However, I suppose you'll have to have
the whole day.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.603
Be here all the earlier next morning.

12:05.674 --> 12:07.164
- Yes, sir.
- Then be off.

12:10.346 --> 12:11.404
Well?

12:12.548 --> 12:15.381
My wages, sir. They fall due today.

12:17.186 --> 12:18.847
Can't wait to spend them?

12:24.627 --> 12:25.719
Thank you, sir.

13:02.298 --> 13:04.732
You rascal! You want more?

13:09.371 --> 13:12.306
Now look here, boys, just because
a fellow wears a hat, you know...

13:12.374 --> 13:14.467
it doesn't mean he can't throw a snowball.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.272
I used to do a lot of snowballing...

13:16.345 --> 13:19.405
and I found the best way to make
a snowball was to take the snow into...

13:19.482 --> 13:21.450
your bare hands, like this, and then...

13:21.517 --> 13:23.917
crunch it together
until the warmth from your hands...

13:23.986 --> 13:24.975
Here!

13:25.087 --> 13:27.214
Look who's coming down the street.
A blooming topper.

13:27.289 --> 13:31.055
- Come on, governor. Show us.
- Right you are. Here, give me room.

13:32.495 --> 13:33.655
Half a more.

13:37.132 --> 13:38.531
Let her go!

13:42.071 --> 13:43.732
A bull's-eye!

13:52.481 --> 13:55.143
I had no idea it was you, master.
No idea at all. Truly, master.

13:55.217 --> 13:57.811
No doubt this is your idea
of a Christmas joke.

13:57.887 --> 13:59.218
I'll get your hat, sir.

14:06.662 --> 14:08.220
I didn't know, sir. The coach, it...

14:08.297 --> 14:12.290
Cratchit, I told you before that I could
find a man more capable than yourself.

14:12.368 --> 14:15.064
- I need say no more.
- You mean, I'm sacked, sir?

14:15.137 --> 14:16.195
Exactly.

14:17.473 --> 14:19.941
But in my papers, sir,
it says I must have a week's notice.

14:20.009 --> 14:23.843
Your week's salary will recompense me
for the price of a new hat. No.

14:23.913 --> 14:27.041
As this hat cost 16 and 6,
and your salary is 15 and 6...

14:27.116 --> 14:28.549
you owe me a shilling.

14:37.226 --> 14:40.662
I say, governor, we are sorry.
The old stinker.

15:13.128 --> 15:16.529
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

15:23.305 --> 15:26.570
I'd like to buy a goose.
About 5 and 8 pence.

15:26.642 --> 15:27.768
Certainly, sir.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.005
- That's the one.
- A very good choice, sir.

15:35.117 --> 15:36.414
Here, let me help you.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.914
4 penneth of potatoes,
6 penneth of mixed nuts...

15:41.991 --> 15:43.151
6 penneth of apples.

15:43.225 --> 15:45.420
The special pippins, sir,
or the medium cookers?

15:45.494 --> 15:46.927
- The special pippins.
- Yes, sir.

15:46.996 --> 15:49.157
And 6 <i>...</i> No, 8 penneth of oranges.

15:49.231 --> 15:50.255
Thank you, sir.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.134
Chestnuts.

15:53.502 --> 15:55.527
Chestnuts, sir? All hot, sir.

15:55.604 --> 15:58.004
They warm the innards
and cheer the heart.

15:58.073 --> 16:00.701
- What's Christmas without chestnuts, sir?
- What indeed.

16:00.776 --> 16:02.038
2 penneth <i>...</i> No, 3 penneth.

16:02.111 --> 16:04.671
- Yes, sir.
- Put them in my back pocket.

16:04.747 --> 16:06.772
- Yes. I will, sir.
- That's it.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.777
- There you are, sir.
- Now the other one.

16:12.321 --> 16:15.256
- Here we are.
- And here's your 3 pence.

16:15.324 --> 16:17.758
- And a merry Christmas.
- Thank you, sir.

16:27.770 --> 16:31.228
- Bob, you have got a load.
- Haven't I, though?

16:31.306 --> 16:33.001
And all for tomorrow.

16:37.613 --> 16:39.274
Let me help you.

16:39.982 --> 16:41.540
- Did you get the oranges?
- Yes.

16:41.617 --> 16:42.641
- And the lemons?
- Yes.

16:42.718 --> 16:44.208
- And the potatoes?
- Yes.

16:44.286 --> 16:45.685
Oh, bless me.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.689
- How did you carry it all?
- I really don't know.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.622
- What's this?
- Guess.

16:56.799 --> 16:58.699
- Roast of beef.
- No. Try again.

16:58.767 --> 16:59.893
- Veal.
- No.

16:59.968 --> 17:00.957
- Tripe.
- No.

17:01.036 --> 17:02.060
- Ribs.
- No.

17:02.137 --> 17:05.367
- I know. Sausages.
- No. Goose.

17:09.912 --> 17:11.106
Look!

17:11.180 --> 17:13.546
Now take it all into the kitchen.
Save Mother a step.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.276
Let me carry something.

17:15.349 --> 17:18.147
- Here, Tim, you may carry the neck.
- Thank you.

17:19.088 --> 17:21.249
Go over to the fire and have a warm, Bob.

17:21.323 --> 17:22.311
Yes, dear.

17:24.159 --> 17:27.424
- Did you get the day off tomorrow?
- Without hardly any trouble at all.

17:27.496 --> 17:30.192
- Wasn't Mr. Scrooge angry?
- Well, you might say he was...

17:30.265 --> 17:32.665
- and you might say he wasn't.
- Meaning what, Bob?

17:32.735 --> 17:36.694
Meaning I got the day off and we don't
want to talk about Mr. Scrooge tonight.

17:37.606 --> 17:39.938
Come here, you monkeys,
and see what I've got.

17:45.347 --> 17:47.474
Chestnuts!

18:49.444 --> 18:50.604
Marley!

20:46.028 --> 20:47.120
Humbug.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.936
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

21:34.009 --> 21:35.340
Who were you then?

21:35.744 --> 21:38.542
In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley.

21:42.117 --> 21:43.209
Well...

21:45.420 --> 21:48.150
- what do you want?
- Much.

21:56.031 --> 21:58.761
- You don't believe in me?
- I don't.

21:59.134 --> 22:03.730
What proof would you have of my reality
beyond that of your own senses?

22:03.805 --> 22:06.865
- I don't know.
- Why do you doubt your senses?

22:06.942 --> 22:08.466
Because a little thing affects them.

22:08.543 --> 22:11.376
A slight disorder of the stomach
makes them liars.

22:12.114 --> 22:16.744
You may be an undigested bit of beef,
a blot of mustard, or a crumb of cheese.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.447
Humbug, I tell you. Humbug!

22:22.257 --> 22:23.349
Silence!

22:24.426 --> 22:26.894
10:00 and all's well.

22:36.138 --> 22:38.868
Watch! There's an intruder in my room.

22:38.940 --> 22:43.070
- Right up, sir. Law and order.
- Here's my key. Make haste.

22:43.345 --> 22:44.334
Good.

22:48.550 --> 22:50.484
We'll soon see how real you are.

22:50.852 --> 22:54.686
I made this visit for your welfare,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

23:04.733 --> 23:06.428
- In here.
- Right-o.

23:06.501 --> 23:08.162
There he is. Out with him!

23:13.108 --> 23:17.010
Your intruder seems to have extruded,
if I may say so, governor.

23:17.079 --> 23:21.072
He was here when I opened the door.
He was a spirit. Someone I know.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.844
Of course, a spirit.

23:24.352 --> 23:27.515
A great night for spirits, sir,
of one sort or another.

23:27.722 --> 23:30.714
Meaning, governor,
we wouldn't mind a bit of spirit ourselves.

23:31.526 --> 23:32.584
You may leave!

23:33.762 --> 23:35.627
Indigestion, that's what it was.

23:36.064 --> 23:37.122
Out with you!

23:37.199 --> 23:39.394
Sorry we couldn't be of any assistance,
governor.

23:39.468 --> 23:41.595
Perhaps the next spirits you have, we can.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.886
Man of the worldly mind.

24:01.957 --> 24:05.324
- Now do you believe in me?
- I do. I must.

24:06.161 --> 24:08.493
But why? Why do you trouble me?

24:08.797 --> 24:12.426
It is required of every man that the spirit
within him should walk abroad...

24:12.501 --> 24:13.866
among his fellow men.

24:14.569 --> 24:18.869
If that spirit goes not forth in life,
it must do so after death.

24:25.213 --> 24:30.116
- You are bound in heavy chains.
- I wear the chain I forged in life.

24:30.652 --> 24:32.677
Is its pattern strange to you?

24:34.222 --> 24:37.385
The chain you will bear
was full as heavy and as long as this...

24:37.459 --> 24:39.188
seven Christmas Eves ago.

24:40.328 --> 24:43.263
It must be a ponderous chain by now.

24:46.434 --> 24:48.459
Jacob. Old Jacob Marley...

24:48.537 --> 24:51.165
- have you no comfort for me?
- None.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.537
And none for myself.

24:54.442 --> 24:56.672
In life, my spirit never walked beyond...

24:56.745 --> 24:59.213
the narrow limits
of our money-changing hole...

25:00.315 --> 25:02.806
and weary journeys lie before me.

25:02.884 --> 25:06.217
- You travel fast?
- On the wings of the wind.

25:06.521 --> 25:10.048
You must have covered a great quantity
of ground in seven years.

25:12.294 --> 25:15.229
Captive, bound, and double-ironed.

25:15.797 --> 25:20.496
No space of regret can make amends
for the wasted opportunities of one life.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.497
Poor and ignorant Scrooge.

25:25.674 --> 25:27.266
Yet, such was I.

25:27.676 --> 25:30.201
But you were always
a good man of business, Jacob.

25:30.278 --> 25:33.509
Business. Mankind was my business.

25:34.216 --> 25:36.480
The common welfare was my business.

25:36.918 --> 25:39.478
Charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence...

25:39.554 --> 25:41.454
all these were my business.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.952
It is at this time of the year
that I suffer most.

25:49.364 --> 25:53.824
To see the want I could have stopped,
the suffering I could have solaced.

25:54.269 --> 25:56.430
The hunger I could have satisfied.

25:57.038 --> 25:58.198
Hear me.

25:59.574 --> 26:01.201
My time is nearly gone.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.777
If you must go, Jacob,
don't let me keep you.

26:04.746 --> 26:09.115
I have sat invisible beside you
many and many a day.

26:11.953 --> 26:15.889
I am here to warn you that you have
one chance of escaping my fate.

26:16.958 --> 26:20.325
- One chance, Ebenezer Scrooge.
- What is it?

26:21.263 --> 26:23.959
You will be haunted by three spirits.

26:24.032 --> 26:27.126
Is that the chance you mentioned, Jacob?

26:27.569 --> 26:28.593
It is.

26:28.970 --> 26:31.632
I think I'd rather not.

26:32.073 --> 26:36.373
Unless you suffer these three visitations,
your fate will be the same as mine.

26:38.380 --> 26:41.042
Jacob. Don't leave me yet. Jacob!

26:41.549 --> 26:44.017
Expect the first when the bell tolls 1:00...

26:44.719 --> 26:47.187
the second on the stroke of 2:00...

26:47.389 --> 26:50.552
the third on the last vibration of 3:00.

26:51.092 --> 26:53.856
Couldn't I take all three at once
and have it over?

27:00.502 --> 27:03.232
Remember, the first at 1:00...

27:03.571 --> 27:06.938
the second at 2:00, the third at 3:00.

28:07.168 --> 28:08.260
Humbug.

28:21.149 --> 28:24.175
- Are you the spirit I was told to expect?
- I am.

28:25.253 --> 28:29.383
- Who are you?
- I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.358
The light. It hurts my eyes.

28:35.430 --> 28:38.160
- It blinds me.
- I'm not surprised.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.930
It's the warming light of thankfulness...

28:41.169 --> 28:43.160
the light of gratitude to others.

28:43.304 --> 28:46.171
- I've never seen it before.
- Of course not.

28:46.708 --> 28:50.269
It's men of greed like you
who have long forgotten gratitude.

28:51.746 --> 28:53.304
What's your business with me?

28:53.581 --> 28:56.448
Your welfare. Your reclamation.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.711
Rise and walk with me.

29:19.541 --> 29:23.068
- We spirits have no fear.
- But I'm not a spirit.

29:24.379 --> 29:28.247
Bear but the touch of my hand
on your heart, and you shall be safe.

30:10.525 --> 30:12.891
Good heaven! This is my old school!

30:13.795 --> 30:15.160
I was a boy here.

30:27.509 --> 30:28.567
Merry Christmas!

30:28.643 --> 30:32.204
Harry, Joe, Tommy, Percy and Dick!

30:32.847 --> 30:34.314
Dick Wilkins!

30:35.483 --> 30:37.951
These are but shadows
of things that have been.

30:38.119 --> 30:41.418
They have no consciousness of us.
You knew them?

30:41.489 --> 30:44.185
I went to school with them, all of them.

30:45.059 --> 30:48.358
- Your lip is trembling.
- The cold.

30:49.097 --> 30:53.193
- Let's continue. You remember this way?
- Remember it?

30:53.601 --> 30:55.466
I could walk it blindfold.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.732
Strange to have forgotten it
for so many years.

31:09.684 --> 31:12.744
- That is myself.
- Was yourself.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.181
Was.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.992
What is that upon your cheek?

31:21.062 --> 31:22.825
Nothing. The cold.

31:24.866 --> 31:25.890
Listen.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.525
Goodbye, young Scrooge.
Merry Christmas.

31:27.602 --> 31:29.797
- Merry Christmas, Jack.
- Your parents coming for you?

31:29.871 --> 31:33.204
- No. I'm staying at school for the holidays.
- You are?

31:33.274 --> 31:36.141
Always do, you know?
Father and I talked it over.

31:36.210 --> 31:39.611
We decided that some extra swatting at
my studies would do me more good than...

31:39.681 --> 31:43.515
Christmas at home.
Christmas, plum pudding and turkeys...

31:43.651 --> 31:45.141
that's just for children.

31:45.219 --> 31:48.382
I say,
your governor must be a crusty old bird.

31:48.456 --> 31:50.924
- He knows what's best.
- Jack, hurry!

31:50.992 --> 31:54.689
Right-o. I didn't mean anything
against your father, Eb. Good luck.

32:01.569 --> 32:03.196
Merry Christmas!

32:54.622 --> 32:57.614
- Master Scrooge.
- Yes, sir?

32:57.692 --> 32:59.421
Your sister's come to see you.

33:00.662 --> 33:02.653
Ebbie, dear Ebbie.

33:04.832 --> 33:06.561
I've come to bring you home.

33:06.868 --> 33:09.029
Home, Fran? Home?

33:09.404 --> 33:11.895
Father is so much kinder
than he used to be...

33:11.973 --> 33:13.463
that home is like heaven.

33:13.708 --> 33:17.200
That's why I asked him if you
could come home, and he said, "Yes."

33:17.278 --> 33:20.042
And he sent me to fetch you with a coach.

33:20.114 --> 33:23.083
And, Ebbie, Father says
that you're going to go to work...

33:23.151 --> 33:24.641
and never come back here.

33:24.719 --> 33:29.122
And we're going to have a turkey
and chestnuts and everything.

33:29.857 --> 33:31.848
God bless you, Fran.

33:32.093 --> 33:35.392
Ebbie, it's going to be so glorious.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.022
God bless you.

33:37.565 --> 33:39.829
- She loved you.
- She did.

33:40.168 --> 33:42.602
I believe she had children before she died.

33:43.104 --> 33:46.130
- One child.
- Your nephew, Fred.

33:49.310 --> 33:50.402
Come.

34:04.926 --> 34:06.223
You remember this place?

34:06.294 --> 34:09.195
Fezziwig's warehouse.
I was apprenticed here.

34:14.168 --> 34:17.331
It's old Fezziwig.
It's old Fezziwig alive again.

34:27.915 --> 34:29.780
Ebenezer, Dick!

34:34.755 --> 34:35.949
Yes, sir?

34:36.324 --> 34:39.020
Ebenezer Scrooge, Dick Wilkins.

34:39.092 --> 34:40.321
Yes, sir?

34:40.393 --> 34:42.190
Do you observe the time, sir?

34:42.263 --> 34:44.389
7:05, sir.

34:44.465 --> 34:47.661
Do you know you've let me work you
five minutes overtime?

34:50.004 --> 34:51.562
No more work tonight.

34:51.639 --> 34:54.107
Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.572
Up with the shutters. Close up shop.

34:59.614 --> 35:02.208
In the eye, Dick. Cheer up, Ebenezer.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.744
What a lark.

35:06.821 --> 35:08.516
He always comes through, doesn't he?

35:08.589 --> 35:11.490
- Always comes through does old Fezziwig.
- And royally, too.

35:11.559 --> 35:14.357
And royally, too.
Nothing's too good for Fezziwig.

35:18.599 --> 35:19.827
Closed up tight, sirs?

35:19.901 --> 35:21.391
- Tight as a barrel, sir.
- Good.

35:21.469 --> 35:22.959
Now, about tomorrow.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.194
It's a holiday, of course.

35:25.273 --> 35:28.436
But I shall expect you to spend part of it,
at least, with me...

35:29.143 --> 35:30.770
eating Christmas dinner.

35:31.479 --> 35:32.537
Thank you, sir.

35:32.613 --> 35:35.104
And as probably you'll eat too much
to be any good next day...

35:35.183 --> 35:37.083
we'll make that a holiday, too.

35:37.151 --> 35:39.915
Good night, Ebenezer. Good night, Dick.

35:40.822 --> 35:43.256
Good night, sir. And thank you, sir.

35:43.324 --> 35:44.757
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

35:46.694 --> 35:48.685
- A sovereign.
- A whole sovereign.

35:48.763 --> 35:52.392
- Solid gold is old Fezziwig.
- Solid gold, through and through.

35:55.169 --> 35:56.534
What is the matter?

35:57.004 --> 35:58.198
Nothing particular.

36:00.174 --> 36:01.607
Something, I think.

36:02.944 --> 36:04.241
Yes, there is.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.212
Old Fezziwig was very kind to me.

36:08.282 --> 36:10.546
Yes, he was. But he's dead now.

36:12.153 --> 36:15.179
Perhaps you feel
you'd like to repay his kindness to you.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.447
Well?

36:16.524 --> 36:18.389
You have a clerk, Bob Cratchit.

36:19.026 --> 36:21.221
Old Fezziwig would have been
very happy...

36:21.295 --> 36:24.526
if you had shown your gratitude to him
by showing kindness to others.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.896
Your clerk, for instance.

36:25.967 --> 36:27.798
Business is business.

36:27.869 --> 36:29.359
I'm a good businessman!

36:30.204 --> 36:31.831
My time grows short.

36:31.906 --> 36:34.306
I have yet to show you the black years
of your life.

36:34.375 --> 36:36.468
Your gradual enslavement to greed.

36:36.544 --> 36:38.034
- Your ruthlessness.
- No!

36:38.112 --> 36:40.876
Your ingratitude.
Your wretched thirst for gold.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.576
No, leave me. I can't stand more.

36:44.018 --> 36:45.645
I can't stand more!

37:48.582 --> 37:51.517
Come here.
Come here and know me better, Scrooge.

37:52.153 --> 37:55.281
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

37:56.457 --> 37:59.483
Have you never seen the like of me before?

37:59.894 --> 38:00.952
Never.

38:02.029 --> 38:06.261
And have you never known my elder
brothers, born these years before me?

38:06.434 --> 38:09.665
I'm afraid I haven't.
Have you had many brothers, Spirit?

38:09.737 --> 38:12.467
A huge number. Some...

38:14.809 --> 38:16.743
1,800.

38:16.978 --> 38:19.412
A tremendous family to provide for.

38:20.247 --> 38:21.612
What are we going to do?

38:21.682 --> 38:24.480
Walk into the world this Christmas night,
so that you can...

38:24.552 --> 38:28.818
hear and see and feel Christmas
in the world this night.

38:28.923 --> 38:31.084
Did you say "walk" or "fly"?

38:31.759 --> 38:33.056
Touch my robe.

38:43.137 --> 38:45.605
Good morning,
and a merry, merry Christmas to you.

38:45.673 --> 38:47.038
Merry Christmas to you.

38:47.108 --> 38:48.905
These people, what are they doing?

38:48.976 --> 38:52.776
The poor find it cheaper to bring
their dinners to the baker to be cooked.

38:53.447 --> 38:55.278
Now then, watch who you're stepping on.

38:55.349 --> 38:58.477
Watch who I'm stepping on? I like that.

38:58.552 --> 39:00.713
- Go on, off it.
- I will not!

39:00.788 --> 39:02.847
Why you little <i>...</i>

39:04.658 --> 39:07.126
- Here, let's make it up.
- Frightened?

39:07.194 --> 39:10.027
I wouldn't touch your old hand.
I wouldn't <i>...</i>

39:11.065 --> 39:13.659
Well, you're not such a bad sort after all.

39:13.734 --> 39:15.725
Thank you, and a merry Christmas to you.

39:15.803 --> 39:17.100
And the same to you.

39:17.304 --> 39:20.740
What do you sprinkle from that horn
that made them stop quarreling?

39:20.808 --> 39:22.070
It's a spirit...

39:22.143 --> 39:25.579
five times distilled,
the spirit of Christmas cheer...

39:25.646 --> 39:27.807
of love, of all that's good...

39:27.882 --> 39:32.319
of all that makes this time of year
different from any other time.

39:36.257 --> 39:39.021
Is there a peculiar flavor
in what you sprinkle?

39:39.093 --> 39:40.651
An excellent flavor.

39:40.761 --> 39:43.025
Would it apply to any kind of dinner?

39:43.097 --> 39:44.496
To a poor one most.

39:44.565 --> 39:46.294
Why to a poor one most?

39:46.367 --> 39:48.358
Because it needs it most.

39:48.436 --> 39:51.200
Look where you're going,
you big, clumsy ox, you. I'll...

39:51.272 --> 39:53.467
I'll shove those words
down your nasty little throat.

39:53.541 --> 39:56.339
Stop shoving, will you?
Stop it, I say, or I'll <i>...</i>

39:57.411 --> 40:00.676
Here we are being silly, aren't we now?

40:00.748 --> 40:02.215
Like a couple of infants.

40:02.283 --> 40:05.480
I say, I know a nice little pub
where they sell hot rum and gin.

40:05.686 --> 40:08.780
- We stopped that.
- Yes, we did, didn't we?

40:13.160 --> 40:14.593
That church.

40:16.163 --> 40:18.893
We have business there. Come.

41:07.815 --> 41:11.307
I don't believe for a minute
that they love one another.

41:11.385 --> 41:13.216
What makes you say that, Spirit?

41:13.988 --> 41:17.253
It is obvious
that they love each other dearly.

41:17.324 --> 41:18.916
Nevertheless, don't you think that...

41:18.993 --> 41:21.860
it's lucky that they haven't
the wherewithal to get married?

41:21.929 --> 41:23.863
Their love will soon fade.

41:23.931 --> 41:25.660
I take exception to that!

41:25.866 --> 41:28.699
On the contrary,
I think their love would grow.

41:28.802 --> 41:30.633
I <i>...</i> They <i>...</i>

41:31.572 --> 41:33.096
They should be married.

42:44.845 --> 42:46.836
- Good morning and merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

42:53.187 --> 42:54.984
Merry Christmas to you.

42:55.055 --> 42:57.148
Bob, a merry Christmas to you.

42:57.224 --> 43:00.250
This is my fiancee, Bess.
This is Mr. Cratchit, and his son Tim.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.726
How do you do?

43:02.296 --> 43:05.026
Now, Tim, no secrets.
What were you saying?

43:05.099 --> 43:06.828
I said, sir <i>...</i>

43:07.534 --> 43:09.832
- I said she's very pretty.
- Tim!

43:10.004 --> 43:12.905
- Thank you kindly, Tim.
- Don't you agree with him, Bob?

43:12.973 --> 43:16.170
- Yes, sir. She is very pretty.
- Father!

43:16.310 --> 43:18.540
Thank you kindly, Mr. Cratchit.

43:18.979 --> 43:20.640
- Good morning.
- Goodbye.

43:20.714 --> 43:22.841
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

43:29.657 --> 43:31.318
Come on, darling. Let's have a slide.

43:31.392 --> 43:32.620
But, Fred, you can't.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.558
Can't I?
You should have seen me yesterday.

43:34.628 --> 43:37.461
But in front of the church? It isn't right.

43:37.598 --> 43:40.260
But, darling, it looks perfect.

43:41.802 --> 43:42.826
It is perfect.

43:42.903 --> 43:45.667
- It's as slippery as a codfish's tummy.
- No, Fred, no!

43:45.739 --> 43:49.368
But, darling, just one slide. Only one.

43:50.244 --> 43:52.576
- Yeah.
- Well, all right.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.811
Boys! Sliding in front of the church?

43:56.150 --> 43:59.278
Now run away home.
And a merry Christmas to you all.

43:59.353 --> 44:01.116
- Run home.
- See?

44:01.555 --> 44:03.284
But, darling, he has no soul.

44:03.357 --> 44:05.154
He's simply acting like a grownup.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.783
I still say he has no soul.

44:06.860 --> 44:09.556
He just doesn't appreciate the qualities
of a good slide.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.141
Come on.

44:34.221 --> 44:35.916
One, two, three.

44:45.299 --> 44:47.859
- Giddyap.
- Merry Christmas, Tom.

44:48.068 --> 44:49.626
And a merry Christmas to you, Bob.

44:49.703 --> 44:53.104
- And to you, too, Tiny Tim.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas, sir.

44:55.209 --> 44:58.474
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

44:59.947 --> 45:04.043
If the shadows remain unaltered
by the future, the child will die.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.086
No!

45:06.220 --> 45:07.847
Surely he'll be spared.

45:07.988 --> 45:11.480
With the kind of care that money can buy,
who could tell?

45:12.092 --> 45:16.188
But Bob Cratchit has no money.
Not even a position, I've heard.

45:17.264 --> 45:20.631
If all this remains unaltered by the future...

45:21.068 --> 45:24.595
the next Christmas
will not find Tiny Tim here.

45:26.006 --> 45:27.473
But what of it?

45:27.541 --> 45:31.807
If he be like to die, he'd better do it
and decrease the population.

45:34.848 --> 45:35.906
Come.

45:43.857 --> 45:46.291
Mother! The goose, we smelled it.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.486
Outside the baker's.

45:47.561 --> 45:49.586
- We did, didn't we?
- It was ours. We knew.

45:49.663 --> 45:50.891
Because of the smell.

45:50.964 --> 45:52.898
Young, sharp noses. Out you go.

45:55.736 --> 45:57.795
What's got into your father and Tim?

45:57.871 --> 46:00.669
And Martha wasn't this late last Christmas
by half an hour.

46:00.808 --> 46:02.139
Here's Martha, Mother.

46:02.209 --> 46:03.836
Here she is, Mother. Here's Martha.

46:03.911 --> 46:06.072
There's a goose for Christmas, Martha.

46:06.713 --> 46:09.147
Bless your heart.
I was afraid you weren't coming.

46:09.216 --> 46:12.117
We'd a deal of sewing to finish
up last night, and this morning...

46:12.186 --> 46:13.653
we had to clear up the shop.

46:13.720 --> 46:15.847
Just so long as you've come.

46:15.923 --> 46:17.447
- You're cold, child.
- Not very.

46:17.524 --> 46:19.287
Sit down by the fire and have a warm.

46:19.359 --> 46:20.621
Father's here, Mama.

46:20.694 --> 46:22.594
- Hide.
- Hide in here.

46:24.998 --> 46:26.966
Here we come.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.530
Whoa it is. Hello.

46:31.772 --> 46:33.137
There we are.

46:33.407 --> 46:34.396
Belinda.

46:35.175 --> 46:37.143
- Where's our Martha?
- Not coming.

46:37.211 --> 46:40.237
Not coming?
Not coming on Christmas day?

46:40.514 --> 46:42.778
Martha girl.

46:43.317 --> 46:45.751
Come, Tim, into the back.
Smell the pudding.

46:47.554 --> 46:50.114
- Was it a good service, Bob?
- Beautiful. That's what it was.

46:50.190 --> 46:51.179
I wish you'd been there.

46:51.258 --> 46:54.318
So long as you and Tim were there,
I feel it did us all good.

46:54.394 --> 46:57.659
- Here, I'll give that gravy what for.
- Thank you, dear.

46:57.731 --> 46:59.824
Belinda, you sweeten up the applesauce.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.868
- I have, Mommy. It's on the table.
- Good girl.

47:01.935 --> 47:04.130
- Peter, take this chair inside.
- Yes, Mother.

47:04.204 --> 47:07.037
Now, I'm going to take one last look
at the table.

47:07.107 --> 47:09.667
What a Christmas!
There never was such a Christmas.

47:09.743 --> 47:12.337
Here, Martha, taste this.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.476
Sweet enough?

47:15.549 --> 47:18.017
- Well, it's still a wee bit sour.
- So.

47:18.685 --> 47:21.153
- Been working hard, Father?
- Yes.

47:21.755 --> 47:23.382
How's old Scrooge?

47:24.858 --> 47:27.486
- Same as ever.
- What's the matter?

47:28.262 --> 47:30.822
Not a thing. Not a single blessed thing.

47:30.898 --> 47:32.388
Something at the office?

47:32.466 --> 47:34.934
No. Why, it was only yesterday
Mr. Scrooge came to me...

47:35.002 --> 47:37.835
shook my hand and, "Cratchit,"
he says, "Cratchit, my lad"...

47:37.905 --> 47:39.532
he calls me "my lad"...

47:39.606 --> 47:42.166
"You're one in 1,000. You're <i>...</i>"

47:42.309 --> 47:44.436
Something is wrong. What is it?

47:53.787 --> 47:56.449
- I've been sacked, Martha.
- Father!

47:56.957 --> 47:59.187
- When was it?
- Last night.

48:00.494 --> 48:02.223
You haven't told Mother?

48:03.697 --> 48:04.857
Bad luck.

48:06.400 --> 48:10.234
Sorry I told you. I really shouldn't have.
I thought it might make me feel better.

48:10.304 --> 48:11.293
Bob!

48:11.538 --> 48:13.904
There's Mother. Come along. Cheer up.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.339
Here we go.

48:15.876 --> 48:17.468
Here we are!

48:18.378 --> 48:19.675
How's that?

48:19.746 --> 48:23.045
You know, I don't think there is anyone,
not anyone, who can touch my punch.

48:23.116 --> 48:24.276
Nor do I, Bob.

48:24.351 --> 48:26.581
- Do you like our table?
- It's beautiful, my dear.

48:26.653 --> 48:28.143
- Peter.
- Yes, Mother?

48:28.255 --> 48:29.552
You can go to the baker's now.

48:29.623 --> 48:31.090
- And get the goose?
- Yes.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.648
The goose!

48:47.774 --> 48:50.004
There never was such a goose.

48:50.644 --> 48:53.613
- It's a good bird, Bob.
- And reasonable, too.

48:55.716 --> 48:58.344
- I'd like to stroke it.
- Tim.

49:03.957 --> 49:06.983
- We haven't eaten it all at last.
- That we haven't.

49:08.095 --> 49:10.063
And now the pudding.

49:10.130 --> 49:12.030
Belinda and me'll clear, Mother.

49:12.099 --> 49:15.000
- I'll help with the pudding, Mother.
- No, I'd rather do it alone.

49:15.068 --> 49:18.003
- It might not turn out.
- Of course it will. It always has.

49:18.071 --> 49:21.370
Unless someone's climbed into the back
and stolen it.

49:23.710 --> 49:25.143
Stolen it?

49:29.716 --> 49:31.013
Hurry, Mother, hurry!

49:36.256 --> 49:37.780
Pass them over to this side.

49:38.825 --> 49:40.224
It's there. The pudding's there.

49:40.293 --> 49:41.817
- Hooray!
- Come along.

49:41.895 --> 49:44.295
I smell it. Do you smell it, Peter?

49:44.598 --> 49:46.031
That's the cloth coming off.

49:46.099 --> 49:47.930
- The holly's in.
- It is?

49:48.168 --> 49:49.533
It's blazing.

49:50.537 --> 49:52.528
Here it comes! Here comes the pudding.

49:52.606 --> 49:55.166
- Off with the lights.
- Off with the lights. Hurry.

49:59.112 --> 50:00.101
Hurry up.

50:04.785 --> 50:07.515
It did turn out, and it's not stolen.

50:16.797 --> 50:19.459
- It looks so good.
- Tim.

50:23.336 --> 50:25.429
It looks like the best you've ever made,
my dear.

50:25.505 --> 50:27.496
Bob, you say that every year.

50:27.574 --> 50:29.064
Every year they get better.

50:29.142 --> 50:31.667
How that's possible, don't ask me.
But it's true.

50:31.745 --> 50:33.007
So eat.

50:35.348 --> 50:37.111
Mother, you haven't got any.

50:37.184 --> 50:38.651
I don't want any, dear.

50:38.719 --> 50:42.246
- You must. Here, have some of mine.
- Just a little spoonful.

50:46.393 --> 50:48.418
I'm sure I'm going to burst.

50:48.495 --> 50:49.826
Not in here, my lad.

50:49.896 --> 50:51.830
If you want to burst, you go outside.

50:52.165 --> 50:54.030
You've hardly any tummy at all.
Look at mine.

50:54.101 --> 50:56.399
Now then, enough of that,
or there will be a calamity.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.529
- Peter, put some chestnuts on the fire.
- Yes, sir.

50:58.605 --> 51:00.004
Let's tidy the table, girls.

51:00.607 --> 51:02.234
Such a smell.

51:02.676 --> 51:03.802
Sweet enough?

51:04.177 --> 51:07.146
Sweet as honey.
Obviously made by an expert.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.915
And are only experts allowed to taste it?

51:10.016 --> 51:12.143
My dear. Glasses all. Glasses.

51:12.919 --> 51:15.251
Fill mine, Father. Thank you.

51:15.322 --> 51:18.223
- Three, four.
- Thank you.

51:18.291 --> 51:20.088
- Five.
- Thank you.

51:20.193 --> 51:21.785
- Six.
- Thank you.

51:21.928 --> 51:23.395
- Seven.
- Thank you.

51:23.897 --> 51:28.061
Well, this is the largest,
but a merry Christmas to us, my dears.

51:28.635 --> 51:30.432
And God bless us all.

51:30.504 --> 51:33.564
And here's to next Christmas,
may it bring us luck.

51:33.774 --> 51:36.299
And may Mr. Scrooge
give your father a raise.

51:36.510 --> 51:39.138
And a merry Christmas to Mr. Scrooge.

51:39.212 --> 51:40.543
I'll drink to that.

51:45.519 --> 51:48.215
- Delicious.
- How lovely.

51:48.288 --> 51:50.188
And now, Father, a story please.

51:50.257 --> 51:52.350
Yes. Please, a story, Father.

51:52.425 --> 51:54.290
Right you are. A story it is.

51:54.427 --> 51:56.258
Come along, kids. Sit here.

51:56.329 --> 51:58.354
Now let me see.

51:59.499 --> 52:01.967
It seems that once upon a time,
there was a little boy...

52:02.035 --> 52:03.627
about your size, Timmy <i>...</i>

52:05.038 --> 52:07.666
- Come, Scrooge, we must go.
- Must we?

52:07.941 --> 52:09.841
Just let me hear Bob's story.

52:09.910 --> 52:12.538
It's about Aladdin and the magic lamp.

52:13.013 --> 52:15.038
Please let me stay.

52:15.715 --> 52:16.909
No, Scrooge.

52:28.528 --> 52:31.861
And he said that Christmas was humbug.
As I live, he did.

52:31.932 --> 52:34.992
As if anything that gave excuse for this
could be humbug.

52:35.202 --> 52:37.796
- Your uncle should be ashamed.
- I'm sorry for him.

52:37.871 --> 52:41.534
I couldn't be angry with him if I tried.
After all, he punishes himself.

52:41.608 --> 52:43.132
And how does he do that, pray?

52:43.210 --> 52:44.837
- Well, he has money, hasn't he?
- Yes.

52:44.911 --> 52:47.778
And he makes no use of it, mark you,
no use of it whatsoever.

52:47.848 --> 52:50.749
Therefore, he's a far more pathetic
and unhappy case...

52:50.817 --> 52:52.580
than a man who has no money at all.

52:52.652 --> 52:54.643
QED, he punishes himself.

52:57.290 --> 52:58.814
Now, that's a wonderful idea.

52:58.892 --> 53:01.725
Tom here suggests that we play a game.
Now what shall it be?

53:01.795 --> 53:04.320
- Blindman's buff.
- Blindman's buff? Right.

53:04.497 --> 53:07.295
But first, I want you to drink a toast.
To my uncle Scrooge.

53:07.367 --> 53:10.302
It seems a shame to waste a toast
on a man like that.

53:10.370 --> 53:14.306
But, darling, think how happy
he makes everyone feel, by contrast.

53:16.243 --> 53:19.144
- To my uncle, Scrooge.
- To Uncle Scrooge.

53:21.314 --> 53:23.714
- Come along now, Tom. You're it.
- Come on, Tom.

53:23.783 --> 53:25.080
You'd best catch us.

53:25.151 --> 53:26.448
Tie it tight.

53:26.887 --> 53:29.014
- Are you sure you can see?
- Perfectly.

53:29.089 --> 53:30.488
That's good.

53:31.291 --> 53:34.192
One, two, three.

53:48.541 --> 53:50.907
Come on, quick.
Quick, he might catch you.

53:57.117 --> 53:59.711
Please, let me stay, just until they finish.

53:59.786 --> 54:02.846
But you don't like Christmas.
It's a time for fools.

54:03.657 --> 54:07.650
I won't go with you. I'm going to stay.
I'm going to stay, I tell you.

54:07.727 --> 54:10.890
Don't be a fool, man.
You don't like Christmas.

54:11.231 --> 54:13.859
But I do. I do like Christmas!

54:13.934 --> 54:15.401
I love Christmas!

55:16.229 --> 55:19.164
You are the Ghost
of Christmas Yet To Come?

55:21.434 --> 55:23.732
You are about to show me things
that have not happened...

55:23.803 --> 55:27.000
but will happen in the future.
Is that so, Spirit?

55:27.907 --> 55:32.071
Ghost of the Future,
I know you are here to do me good...

55:32.145 --> 55:34.670
and as I hope to be another man
from what I was...

55:34.748 --> 55:37.683
I'm ready to accompany you.
Won't you speak?

55:38.818 --> 55:39.910
Lead on.

55:40.253 --> 55:42.414
I shall follow gladly.

55:58.905 --> 56:01.772
No, I don't know much about it either way.
I only know he's dead.

56:01.841 --> 56:03.809
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.

56:03.877 --> 56:06.437
- What was the matter with him?
- Who knows? Who cares?

56:06.513 --> 56:08.708
- What has he done with his money?
- I haven't heard.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.410
He hasn't left it to me. That's all I know.

56:11.885 --> 56:13.876
It's likely to be a very cheap funeral.

56:13.953 --> 56:16.444
Upon my life,
I can't think of anybody to go to it.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.648
Suppose we form a party and volunteer.

56:18.725 --> 56:20.920
I don't mind going, if a lunch is provided.

56:20.994 --> 56:22.894
I'll offer to go if anybody else will.

56:22.962 --> 56:26.159
Now I come to think of it,
I'm not sure I wasn't his best friend.

56:26.232 --> 56:28.632
We used to stop and speak
whenever we met.

56:29.102 --> 56:31.332
Goodbye.

56:37.444 --> 56:39.309
- How are you?
- How are you?

56:39.379 --> 56:41.404
I know them. I know them both.

56:41.481 --> 56:42.880
Business associates.

56:43.383 --> 56:46.045
So Old Scratch got his own at last?

56:46.119 --> 56:48.849
Yeah, so I've been told. It's cold, isn't it?

56:48.922 --> 56:50.514
Seasonable for Christmas.

56:50.657 --> 56:54.252
- You're not a skater, I suppose.
- No time for it. Business on my mind.

56:54.494 --> 56:56.485
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

57:20.854 --> 57:22.116
Is death always like this?

57:22.188 --> 57:24.486
Is it never followed
by sorrow and weeping?

57:35.835 --> 57:38.269
It must be getting near your father's time.

57:39.305 --> 57:40.602
Past it, Mommy.

57:41.441 --> 57:44.706
Though he has walked home slower
these last few evenings.

57:45.445 --> 57:49.211
I've known him walk with Tiny Tim
upon his shoulder very fast indeed.

57:49.682 --> 57:51.809
And so have I, often.

57:52.118 --> 57:56.020
But he was very light to carry,
and his father loved him so.

57:56.990 --> 57:59.515
It was no trouble. No trouble.

58:01.494 --> 58:03.189
There's your father at the door.

58:09.102 --> 58:11.070
There you are, my nippers.

58:15.708 --> 58:16.800
Dear.

58:26.419 --> 58:28.046
Here, Father, sit here.

58:31.991 --> 58:34.721
I saw Mr. Scrooge's nephew today.

58:34.794 --> 58:35.818
You did?

58:35.895 --> 58:40.389
Yes, he is a nice fellow.
He saw I looked a trifle down.

58:40.466 --> 58:42.093
Just a trifle, you know.

58:42.802 --> 58:44.770
He asked me what was wrong.

58:45.672 --> 58:47.003
Thank you, dear.

58:47.674 --> 58:50.575
I told him about Tim.

58:51.544 --> 58:54.809
He's such a sweet fellow,
somehow I didn't mind telling him.

58:55.181 --> 58:57.945
"I'm heartily sorry for it, Bob," he said.

58:58.384 --> 59:01.820
"And heartily sorry for your good wife."

59:06.659 --> 59:09.856
By the by, how he ever knew that,
I don't know.

59:10.630 --> 59:12.120
Knew what, my dear?

59:13.700 --> 59:16.965
- That you were a good wife.
- Bob.

59:20.240 --> 59:24.700
It really seemed that he knew our Tim
and felt with us.

59:25.411 --> 59:28.676
- I'm sure he's a good soul, Bob.
- He is.

59:32.352 --> 59:33.785
And I'm sure that...

59:34.821 --> 59:38.848
when we remember
how gentle and patient Tim was...

59:40.193 --> 59:42.423
we shan't quarrel among ourselves...

59:43.196 --> 59:45.790
and in doing it, forget our Tim.

59:46.466 --> 59:47.660
No, Father.

59:49.969 --> 59:51.368
I'm very happy.

59:52.572 --> 59:53.834
I am.

59:56.476 --> 59:59.138
Poor Tim. Poor Tiny Tim.

01:00:00.613 --> 01:00:05.141
Everyone who knew him must feel sorrow.
Sorrow they'd never feel for me.

01:00:06.653 --> 01:00:07.745
Spirit...

01:00:08.254 --> 01:00:11.018
tell me the name of the man
we saw lying dead.

01:00:11.791 --> 01:00:12.815
Tell me!

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:39.712
Answer me this, Spirit.
Are these things you've shown me...

01:00:39.786 --> 01:00:44.280
are they the shadows of the things
that will be, or of the things that may be?

01:00:46.025 --> 01:00:48.493
Men's lives lead to certain ends...

01:00:49.162 --> 01:00:52.689
but if those lives be changed,
will not the ends be changed?

01:00:53.032 --> 01:00:56.024
Tell me that is true! Tell me!

01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:10.513
Then I was the man who lay upon the bed.

01:01:12.485 --> 01:01:13.543
No!

01:01:13.986 --> 01:01:16.784
Why show me this if I am past all hope?

01:01:17.557 --> 01:01:22.051
I shall change my way of living.
I will try to keep Christmas all the year.

01:01:22.528 --> 01:01:24.587
I will live in the past, the present,
and the future.

01:01:24.664 --> 01:01:27.064
The spirit of all three shall be in my heart.

01:01:27.133 --> 01:01:29.693
I shall never forget the lessons
that they teach.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:32.870
Tell me that this will change my future.

01:01:34.073 --> 01:01:36.906
Tell me that this is not my end.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.104
Please!

01:02:28.227 --> 01:02:29.319
Hello!

01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:31.929
Hello, there. What's today?

01:02:32.899 --> 01:02:35.561
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today?

01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:37.267
Why, Christmas day.

01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:40.305
Do you know the poulterer's
at the next street but one, at the corner?

01:02:40.373 --> 01:02:42.967
- I should hope I do.
- An intelligent boy.

01:02:43.042 --> 01:02:44.566
A remarkable boy.

01:02:44.811 --> 01:02:48.008
Do you know whether they've sold
the prize turkey that was hanging there?

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.378
Not the little prize turkey, the big one.

01:02:50.483 --> 01:02:52.417
- It's hanging there now.
- Is it?

01:02:52.552 --> 01:02:54.486
- Well, go and buy it.
- What, sir?

01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:57.079
I'm in earnest. Yes, I am. Go and buy it.

01:02:57.156 --> 01:03:00.421
Come back in less than five minutes,
and I'll give you half a crown.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.353
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:41.431
My dear sirs, how do you do?

01:03:41.767 --> 01:03:44.634
How do you do?
A merry Christmas to you.

01:03:44.704 --> 01:03:45.762
Mr. Scrooge?

01:03:45.838 --> 01:03:47.999
Yes, that is my name.
It may not be pleasant to you.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.601
Let me ask your pardon.
And will you have the goodness to take <i>...</i>

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.948
Why, bless me, Mr. Scrooge.
Are you in earnest?

01:03:57.016 --> 01:04:00.213
If you please. Not a farthing less.
There are a great many back payments...

01:04:00.286 --> 01:04:01.913
in that amount. Will you do me that favor?

01:04:01.988 --> 01:04:05.617
My dear Mr. Scrooge,
I don't know what to say. Such <i>...</i>

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:08.090
Such generosity.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.119
Don't say anything, please, but come
and see me. Will you come and see me?

01:04:12.198 --> 01:04:13.790
We will, Mr. Scrooge.

01:04:13.866 --> 01:04:15.959
Thank you. Bless you.

01:04:30.316 --> 01:04:31.715
Hello, my love.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:35.053
- Would you tell Mr. Fred I wish to see him?
- Yes, sir.

01:04:40.192 --> 01:04:41.250
Fred!

01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:44.261
- Who is this?
- Your uncle.

01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:46.358
Your uncle Scrooge.

01:04:47.033 --> 01:04:50.127
Uncle, I didn't know you.

01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:52.430
The smile changes me, doesn't it?

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:57.170
But, what are we doing out here?
Come in, Uncle, come in.

01:04:58.945 --> 01:05:01.379
This is my uncle. My uncle Scrooge.

01:05:01.447 --> 01:05:02.505
How do you do?

01:05:02.582 --> 01:05:04.379
Fred, you dog. Who is this fellow?

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:07.908
Not your uncle, I'll be bound.
He'd never have a smile like that.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.148
- He said that...
- That Christmas was a humbug.

01:05:10.222 --> 01:05:13.555
- That people who celebrated it were fools.
- Yes, that's what he said.

01:05:13.626 --> 01:05:16.493
It was stupid of him.
He won't say it again, mark you.

01:05:16.562 --> 01:05:18.530
He won't say it again, ever.

01:05:20.466 --> 01:05:22.024
And this is Bess.

01:05:22.868 --> 01:05:24.392
May I tell you a secret?

01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:30.972
Here, I say. Now what is this?

01:05:31.911 --> 01:05:33.879
- No.
- You tell him.

01:05:34.313 --> 01:05:35.780
Fred!

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.614
Darling!

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:45.456
That's wonderful.

01:05:53.399 --> 01:05:54.730
Uncle, thank you so much.

01:06:11.584 --> 01:06:13.552
- Merry Christmas, Bob.
- What?

01:06:13.853 --> 01:06:15.252
Merry Christmas, Bob!

01:06:18.858 --> 01:06:21.326
Here, give this to your wife.

01:06:21.861 --> 01:06:23.192
Your good wife.

01:06:23.929 --> 01:06:26.762
- Where's Tiny Tim?
- He's out in the back with the others.

01:06:26.832 --> 01:06:28.629
Well, get him. Bring him here.

01:06:28.868 --> 01:06:31.234
- Bring them all here.
- Yes, sir, I shall.

01:06:33.572 --> 01:06:35.938
It's Scrooge. It's Mr. Scrooge.

01:06:37.176 --> 01:06:39.906
He's crazy. Quite mad.
Off his top. Lost his buttons.

01:06:39.979 --> 01:06:42.880
- Don't be stupid, Bob.
- Look, he gave us this, and more besides.

01:06:42.948 --> 01:06:44.074
- Gave it to us?
- Yes.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:46.710
Then he has gone mad.
Bob, what shall we do?

01:06:48.487 --> 01:06:50.614
Our children, Bob. Save them!

01:07:06.972 --> 01:07:09.964
Thank heaven, Mr. Fred. You've come
for him, of course. Poor fellow.

01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:12.670
Did you think he'd gone barmy, too?
No, we haven't come for him.

01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:16.236
He told us to wait outside. He said he had
some presents he wanted to give you.

01:07:16.315 --> 01:07:17.714
- Then he's all right?
- I hope so.

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:20.411
He made me his partner.
We're to be married, Bob.

01:07:20.486 --> 01:07:22.147
Isn't that wonderful?

01:07:22.221 --> 01:07:24.416
- It is wonderful.
- Yes.

01:07:24.523 --> 01:07:26.047
My wife.

01:07:29.161 --> 01:07:30.150
My dear.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:35.657
- Has he gone?
- He's all right.

01:07:35.735 --> 01:07:38.363
- Come along, you must meet him.
- No.

01:07:41.907 --> 01:07:44.842
- Bob Cratchit.
- Yes, sir?

01:07:45.444 --> 01:07:47.435
- Pass out the punch.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:54.253 --> 01:07:56.585
I'm going to raise your salary, Bob.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.684
Thank you, sir.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:00.955
Are you sure?

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.430
And when Peter, the scoundrel,
when Peter gets a little older...

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.466
we'll have a job for him, too.

01:08:07.533 --> 01:08:09.433
- Won't we, Fred?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:12.963
- Everything for everybody, Fred?
- Yes.

01:08:13.439 --> 01:08:14.633
Here it is, sir.

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:18.038
I'm a little rusty at this.

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:21.238
- I've never done it before, but may I?
- Yes.

01:08:21.313 --> 01:08:22.301
Please do.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:25.548
To all of us, everywhere.

01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:29.912
A merry Christmas to us all, my dears.

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:33.058
God bless us, every one.
