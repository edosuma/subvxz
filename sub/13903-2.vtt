WEBVTT

00:07.425 --> 00:09.505
My body is my work.

00:10.465 --> 00:14.025
If I'm not in good shape,
neither is my career, so...

00:15.065 --> 00:19.465
..Belle is considering
some professional...

00:21.105 --> 00:22.945
..development.

00:26.865 --> 00:28.905
Right. Let's take a look.

01:13.345 --> 01:14.945
Yeah.

01:14.945 --> 01:17.465
Mm. Augmentation, Doctor?

01:17.465 --> 01:19.025
Yeah. Without a doubt.

01:19.025 --> 01:21.105
Yes.
I'd say a mastoplexy too.

01:21.105 --> 01:22.785
Oh, I can see that.

01:22.785 --> 01:24.385
It's a big job.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.705
But it's not impossible.
No.

01:26.705 --> 01:27.705
Erm...

01:29.145 --> 01:31.185
Oh, sorry. Er...

01:31.185 --> 01:33.745
This will give you some idea
of where the incisions would be.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.145
Mm-hm.

01:35.145 --> 01:39.345
You er... You cut round the nipples?

01:39.345 --> 01:41.225
The nipples are repositioned.

01:41.225 --> 01:43.345
It's a lift so we'd have to move
them up the breast.

01:43.345 --> 01:45.345
There will be some scarring,

01:45.345 --> 01:48.825
but since there's a change of colour
anyway it's a nifty solution.

01:50.505 --> 01:51.825
Nifty. It's...

01:54.985 --> 01:56.225
Hm...

01:56.225 --> 01:58.185
You've got a slight abnormality

01:58.185 --> 02:00.265
of the breast
that's called tuberous.

02:00.265 --> 02:01.665
Tumorous?

02:01.665 --> 02:03.345
No, no, tu-ber-ous.

02:03.345 --> 02:07.945
It's a condition where the breasts
are quite long in shape,

02:07.945 --> 02:09.664
rather than high and round.

02:09.664 --> 02:11.105
We can correct it.

02:11.105 --> 02:14.505
God, I didn't realise there was
an actual term. It's not uncommon.

02:14.505 --> 02:16.065
Have you had children?

02:16.065 --> 02:18.105
No.

02:18.105 --> 02:21.305
I should ask, what has prompted
you to consider the surgery?

02:21.305 --> 02:24.505
Well, I thought in my line of work
it might be useful.

02:24.505 --> 02:26.705
Are you a model?
Yeah...

02:26.705 --> 02:28.665
stroke, actress...

02:28.665 --> 02:31.785
stroke, physical therapist...

02:31.785 --> 02:34.305
stroke, counsellor...

02:34.305 --> 02:36.865
stroke -
I'll put self-employed.

02:38.905 --> 02:41.785
Do I...? Do I need them done?

02:43.385 --> 02:45.705
At least Belle
can claim it back on tax.

02:47.545 --> 02:51.505
'Hey, Hannah, it's Alex. I wondered
if you still fancied that drink?

02:51.505 --> 02:55.105
'Let me know
if you've got a free evening.'

02:55.105 --> 02:58.505
Hardly. Belle's a busy girl.

03:00.465 --> 03:02.425
Hi. Oh, sorry, Belle, you were -

03:02.425 --> 03:05.425
No, it's fine, it's just me! Hi.

03:05.425 --> 03:07.185
Hello!

03:09.505 --> 03:13.265
I'm sorry if I seemed a bit rude -
No, not at all, you're at work.

03:13.265 --> 03:15.065
It's just with Eleanor there
Of course.

03:15.065 --> 03:18.625
Thanks for seeing me.
I thought it was better than going
to see some stranger.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.665
Belle?
Yeah?

03:24.065 --> 03:26.225
Maybe we should make
another appointment.

03:27.705 --> 03:29.545
With you or with me?

03:30.905 --> 03:32.385
For me, with you.

03:33.385 --> 03:36.385
Yeah, I can do -
Tomorrow. Just an hour.

03:37.545 --> 03:40.145
Tomorrow afternoon, four, at mine?

03:40.145 --> 03:42.145
Yeah, that's grand, thanks.

03:43.785 --> 03:45.465
Can I erm...?
Yeah.

03:51.825 --> 03:53.705
I should probably -
Yeah, probably.

03:57.545 --> 03:59.465
I can't wait. Look forward to it.

04:01.145 --> 04:02.985
Just...

04:11.105 --> 04:14.745
I can't go on a real date
like a normal person.

04:14.745 --> 04:16.985
I'm a prostitute.

04:18.545 --> 04:20.265
That's what I am.

04:24.985 --> 04:26.665
I'm an independent prostitute.

04:26.665 --> 04:28.625
No agency, no madam.

04:28.625 --> 04:31.305
No-one leeching off me.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.905
In the end,
you can only rely on yourself.

04:35.505 --> 04:37.065
Belle! Belle!

04:37.065 --> 04:38.585
Hiya!

04:38.585 --> 04:40.265
Bambi.

04:40.265 --> 04:42.065
I knew it was you!

04:42.065 --> 04:44.105
How are you?
Yeah, good, ta.

04:44.105 --> 04:47.145
I should say thanks for all the
advice you gave me about the job.

04:47.145 --> 04:49.905
Oh, you're welcome.
I'm going for it!

04:49.905 --> 04:51.745
Oh! Wow!

04:51.745 --> 04:54.305
That's good...I guess.

04:54.305 --> 04:57.505
So erm...
have you done proper research?

04:57.505 --> 04:59.985
I mean, have you erm...
have you got an agency?

04:59.985 --> 05:02.905
I'm sorted. I've been talking
to this bloke on the net.

05:02.905 --> 05:04.585
He's got his own studio thing
in Bow.

05:04.585 --> 05:06.625
Take your pictures and everything.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.665
Bambi, Stephanie.

05:23.665 --> 05:25.785
Stephanie, Bambi.
All right?

05:25.785 --> 05:28.545
Good Lord, look who it is.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.505
It's just an introduction,
and it's probably a very bad idea.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.105
You bought me a little friend?

05:33.105 --> 05:35.825
Yeah, and I'm off.
Oh, Belle, wait.

05:37.665 --> 05:39.585
Can't you stay? She's scary.

05:39.585 --> 05:43.185
Bambi, you were off to some strange
bloke's garage in Bow.

05:43.185 --> 05:44.825
Yeah, but...

05:44.825 --> 05:46.865
Oh, go on, just for a minute.

05:51.425 --> 05:54.025
Let's have a look. Profile.

05:54.025 --> 05:56.905
Yeah, needs work,
but we could have something here.

05:56.905 --> 05:59.825
Punters love a new girl.
Can't help that.

05:59.825 --> 06:03.425
Nothing can replace experience.
Ooh, older girls always say that.

06:03.425 --> 06:05.185
I'm not old.

06:05.185 --> 06:07.185
I just mean for an escort.
Your body changes.

06:07.185 --> 06:09.705
Young girls come up on the inside.

06:09.705 --> 06:11.465
Bambi sweetheart, it's the only job

06:11.465 --> 06:13.945
where the less you've worked,
the more you can charge.

06:13.945 --> 06:15.785
Nearly half of which she takes,
by the way.

06:16.905 --> 06:18.905
Are you just going
to undermine me, Belle?

06:18.905 --> 06:20.425
No. I'm just being honest.

06:21.585 --> 06:23.905
You know, Bambi, you need work,

06:23.905 --> 06:26.905
but my books could really use
a nice British girl.

06:26.905 --> 06:28.905
That used to be Belle.

06:28.905 --> 06:33.105
She was always available, all about
the job, one hundred percent escort.

06:33.105 --> 06:34.865
I'm not all about the job.

06:34.865 --> 06:38.585
It's just Eastern Europeans
and nasty porn stars these day.

06:38.585 --> 06:41.265
I did a bit of porn.

06:43.345 --> 06:46.145
Funny, they all look down
on you lot, you know.

06:46.145 --> 06:48.385
"I'm a performer not a prostitute,"

06:48.385 --> 06:51.265
and you're all,
"I'm an escort, I'd never do porn."

06:51.265 --> 06:54.425
Well, you know, in my time I've done
things you couldn't even imagine.

06:54.425 --> 06:56.425
The work will always be there.

06:56.425 --> 06:59.105
A city without whores
is like a house without bathrooms.

06:59.105 --> 07:01.185
Have a think about it.

07:01.185 --> 07:03.745
Actually,
I reckon I've made my decision.

07:04.865 --> 07:07.265
I wanna be independent. Like Belle.

07:07.265 --> 07:09.425
Well, if you ever change your mind,

07:09.425 --> 07:12.105
you too, Belle,
the door's always open,

07:12.105 --> 07:13.825
as long as your legs are.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.625
I can let you know what I do,
but I'm not going to be your mentor.

07:21.865 --> 07:23.785
Ment-whore!

07:24.825 --> 07:26.705
OK, sorry, let me know what you do.

07:27.785 --> 07:29.985
Just so you know...

07:29.985 --> 07:31.905
the most important thing - safety.

07:31.905 --> 07:35.265
And that is why...
Look at this email.

07:35.265 --> 07:37.305
See, I'd never go near this one.

07:37.305 --> 07:40.905
"Hey baby," and he's misspelled
"baby" - You're a snob!

07:40.905 --> 07:42.985
Yeah, I am a snob.
The whole tone of it is wrong.

07:42.985 --> 07:45.385
(MOBILE RINGS)

07:45.385 --> 07:47.705
It comes with experience.

07:49.705 --> 07:52.905
I've er...
I've got to a point where I'm more...

07:52.905 --> 07:56.025
I'm more confident,
not easily intimidated.

07:56.025 --> 07:57.425
What's that?

07:57.425 --> 07:59.465
It's just some bloke
who wants to go on a date.

07:59.465 --> 08:03.225
I'll do it. No, not like that.
Proper, real life date.

08:03.225 --> 08:04.745
You should go.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.425
No, bad idea.
Good idea.

08:06.425 --> 08:08.505
Anyway, so I was saying,

08:08.505 --> 08:12.065
the biggest security stuff
happens before the appointment.

08:12.065 --> 08:14.025
You should call that bloke back,
you know.

08:14.025 --> 08:16.785
No, I don't date like civilians.
It's just a drink.

08:16.785 --> 08:18.945
My days, If I didn't know,

08:18.945 --> 08:21.625
I would say you were well in need
of getting laid.

08:22.825 --> 08:24.265
Hardly.

08:24.265 --> 08:26.105
You are all work and no play, babes.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.705
(SIGHS)

08:27.705 --> 08:29.305
Yes.

08:29.305 --> 08:31.145
I don't know.

08:31.145 --> 08:34.065
Somewhere along the line,
since my best mate left London,

08:34.065 --> 08:36.505
I couldn't really be arsed
with a personal life.

08:36.505 --> 08:38.345
Not that much going on except work.

08:38.345 --> 08:40.184
It'll be larks.

08:40.184 --> 08:42.424
Have a beer, have a flirt.

08:43.505 --> 08:45.225
What's your real name?

08:46.705 --> 08:48.225
Hannah.

08:48.225 --> 08:51.865
Well, Hannah needs some loving too.
Yeah, maybe.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.905
Go on, do it.
I'm not gonna leave until you do it.

08:53.905 --> 08:55.905
Er...
Go on! Do it!

08:55.905 --> 08:57.825
Do it, do it, do it.
All right. OK.

09:07.345 --> 09:08.745
Hi.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.105
OK, bye.

09:34.625 --> 09:39.545
So I erm...have a date
tomorrow night.

09:39.545 --> 09:42.305
Yeah, looks like you do!

09:56.034 --> 09:59.194
These days I can get ready
for a client in my sleep.

09:59.194 --> 10:04.594
They like big hair,
big breasts and a big smile.

10:09.354 --> 10:11.114
But you can't fake everything.

10:18.474 --> 10:20.234
That's it.

10:20.234 --> 10:22.714
I'm gonna make such a mess of you.

10:32.314 --> 10:34.674
I'm sorry, Belle,
I don't think it's gonna happen.

10:38.154 --> 10:40.674
Are you sure
you should have any more of that?

10:40.674 --> 10:42.274
It's not this.

10:44.274 --> 10:46.554
Oh, my God, it's my tits, isn't it?

10:48.314 --> 10:52.154
You think they look
like spaniels ears...with nipples.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.514
No.

10:55.514 --> 10:57.234
Well, yeah.

10:57.234 --> 10:58.874
No, but not like that.

10:59.994 --> 11:01.834
You've got lovely normal breasts.

11:01.834 --> 11:03.794
Hm, normal.
Do you want some?

11:03.794 --> 11:05.234
No, I don't.

11:06.594 --> 11:09.954
See I look at them now and I think
what I said to you. It's your job.

11:09.954 --> 11:11.434
Yeah. God, I hate my job.

11:11.434 --> 11:12.954
Really? Why?

11:12.954 --> 11:14.794
Anal bleaching.

11:14.794 --> 11:16.434
Vaginoplasty.

11:19.634 --> 11:21.634
Look, I know it's your choice,
and all,

11:21.634 --> 11:23.714
and I know, you know, women are free

11:23.714 --> 11:26.754
to disempower themselves these days
or whatever.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.714
Yeah, we appreciate that.

11:28.714 --> 11:30.994
I should be helping burns victims.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.674
I could set fire to my breasts.

11:33.674 --> 11:35.594
That won't be necessary.

11:38.314 --> 11:42.794
I specifically started seeing you
because you haven't had work.

11:42.794 --> 11:46.434
I don't want to be scrutinizing
another man's work when I'm...

11:46.434 --> 11:48.114
in the moment.
Sure.

11:50.674 --> 11:53.074
I can't work on you
and carry on seeing you.

11:53.074 --> 11:58.434
There's something still a bit...
normal about you. I like that.

11:58.434 --> 12:00.354
Thanks very much.

12:00.354 --> 12:02.194
I've become a shitty person.

12:02.194 --> 12:04.354
No! It's your work.

12:04.354 --> 12:07.114
You don't see me getting all
moralistic about what I do, do you?

12:07.114 --> 12:09.674
Yeah, well, your job is about making
people feel better.

12:09.674 --> 12:12.114
I make people feel awful
about themselves.

12:12.114 --> 12:14.434
Tuberous breasts.

12:16.274 --> 12:17.874
We made it up.

12:20.234 --> 12:22.554
Breasts are breasts.

12:29.914 --> 12:32.274
(GERMAN ACCENT)
There's nothing wrong with you.

12:32.274 --> 12:33.794
Really?

12:37.434 --> 12:39.554
Really.

12:39.554 --> 12:40.794
Mm-hm!

12:58.514 --> 13:00.594
I'm definitely keeping this, though.
Mm-hm.

13:03.474 --> 13:06.634
Oh, the last time I rang you
to make an appointment,

13:06.634 --> 13:10.194
I got that other girl, erm...
the one who answered your phone.

13:10.194 --> 13:11.754
What?

13:11.754 --> 13:13.434
The one you sent round instead
of you.

13:13.434 --> 13:15.954
It's just that I'd rather see you
than your replacement.

13:15.954 --> 13:17.594
What girl?

13:17.594 --> 13:19.634
Stealing clients off me?

13:19.634 --> 13:23.194
You answered my phone and you've been
on my laptop to reply to that email.

13:23.194 --> 13:24.914
I am trying to help you!

13:24.914 --> 13:27.154
I can't believe you're so fucking
disingenuous!

13:27.154 --> 13:29.034
You know what, don't call me back!

13:30.634 --> 13:35.714
This is why you should never help
anyone. Other people are bastards.

13:36.914 --> 13:41.074
And now I have to go on a date!
With a real person!

13:43.674 --> 13:45.354
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Hi.

13:45.354 --> 13:47.794
It's OK. Sit yourself down.

13:47.794 --> 13:51.554
Do you wanna drink? Er I'll just...
I'll have whatever you're having.

13:51.554 --> 13:53.034
A bottle of -
Actually, no.

13:53.034 --> 13:58.754
I'll have what I want
and I'll have...ooh...

13:58.754 --> 14:01.954
I'll have a beer.
I'll have erm...a glass of red wine.

14:01.954 --> 14:03.514
Cheers.

14:03.514 --> 14:04.874
Cheers.

14:04.874 --> 14:06.514
No. I was just saying thank you
to him.

14:06.514 --> 14:09.114
Oh, right.
Yeah cos we haven't got our drinks.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.154
Yes.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.754
Oops!

14:12.754 --> 14:15.474
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

14:22.394 --> 14:24.034
Have...

14:24.034 --> 14:25.434
Erm...sorry.

14:25.434 --> 14:27.434
You've... Have you...?

14:27.434 --> 14:30.634
Don't worry. It's nothing.
Oh, my God.

14:30.634 --> 14:32.394
Not that, not that.

14:32.394 --> 14:34.674
It looks like
there's something drawn on your...

14:34.674 --> 14:36.194
Oh, yeah. No...

14:36.194 --> 14:37.754
This is a moustache.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.834
I am so sorry. Oh...

14:40.834 --> 14:44.434
No, no! It's not a real one.
I...I drew it on.

14:47.114 --> 14:50.274
Sometimes I like to draw facial hair
on myself.

14:53.154 --> 14:54.754
Excellent.

15:04.074 --> 15:07.034
Erm...do you know
what you're gonna have?

15:07.034 --> 15:13.034
I...might...have...the...steak.
Hm.

15:13.034 --> 15:15.394
So, you've just moved back.
How are you finding London?

15:15.394 --> 15:18.354
Ah. Oh.
I'd forgotten how great it was.

15:18.354 --> 15:20.354
You know?

15:20.354 --> 15:22.354
Nobody looks at you.
Nobody gives a shit.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.994
You could walk down the road
with a big massive stupid hat

15:24.994 --> 15:28.314
and people would just go,
"Look, there's a guy with a big
massive stupid hat."

15:29.874 --> 15:33.314
Sometimes I go to the shops
in my pyjamas!

15:37.834 --> 15:40.074
What do you do?

15:40.074 --> 15:44.314
Ah, that's a... That's a really
shit question. Sorry.

15:45.394 --> 15:47.354
I'm a night time legal secretary.

15:48.154 --> 15:49.514
Shall we order?

15:49.514 --> 15:51.954
Yeah.

15:51.954 --> 15:55.074
No, no. Why are you thinking
about getting surgery?

15:55.074 --> 15:56.914
I wasn't seriously thinking about it.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.794
Well, maybe just a little bit.

15:58.794 --> 16:02.234
One of the fastest growing areas
of surgery

16:02.234 --> 16:04.354
is repairing botched boob jobs.

16:04.354 --> 16:08.714
Yeah, they harden, they rupture,
they leek into the body. It's..

16:08.714 --> 16:10.434
I'm sorry, we've just eaten.

16:10.434 --> 16:12.354
No, no, don't worry,
I'm not squeamish.

16:12.354 --> 16:14.234
Neither am I.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.874
That's good.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.434
What does that mean?

16:17.434 --> 16:19.434
I don't know. I'm really drunk.

16:19.434 --> 16:20.914
(LAUGHS)

16:20.914 --> 16:22.874
You just looked like you were going

16:22.874 --> 16:25.074
to do something really wicked
to me later.

16:25.074 --> 16:29.034
No, I just... It's just...
I meant because you're a doctor.

16:29.034 --> 16:32.154
Ooh, good,
you talked your way out of that one.

16:32.154 --> 16:36.314
Although I am going to do something
terrible to you as well later.

16:36.314 --> 16:38.074
Really?

16:38.074 --> 16:41.434
Jolly good.
I hope you bought the equipment.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.834
Wow!

16:45.914 --> 16:48.074
(PHONE RINGS)

16:49.834 --> 16:52.114
Is that you?

16:52.114 --> 16:53.674
Is what me?

16:53.674 --> 16:54.994
Oh.

16:55.994 --> 16:57.634
Sorry!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.354
What?
I'm so sorry.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.674
I didn't know who else to call.
(BANGING ON DOOR)

17:04.674 --> 17:07.314
I'm in trouble. I'm with this guy.

17:07.314 --> 17:09.554
He's gone really weird.

17:09.554 --> 17:12.993
I've locked myself in the bathroom,
but I just dunno what to do

17:12.993 --> 17:14.473
Where...? Where are you?

17:14.473 --> 17:17.394
I don't know. I can't remember.
My heads gone all funny.

17:17.394 --> 17:18.914
I can't think straight.

17:18.914 --> 17:20.674
OK, calm down. Catch your breath.

17:21.634 --> 17:24.273
Was it a hotel?
'Yeah, yeah.'

17:24.273 --> 17:28.074
Erm...can you see any
of those toiletries around you?

17:28.074 --> 17:30.514
'Those little bottles you get?'
Come on, darling.

17:30.514 --> 17:33.514
Yeah, OK.
'What does it say?'

17:33.514 --> 17:35.754
Erm it says the Blakely.
Come on!

17:35.754 --> 17:37.394
Come on!
'I think I know it.'

17:37.394 --> 17:39.194
OK. Don't worry I'm coming over.

17:39.194 --> 17:40.754
(BANGING ON DOOR)

17:40.754 --> 17:42.714
I'm so sorry, I've got to go.
You all right?

17:42.714 --> 17:45.154
I'm gonna come with you.
Er, no, no, you can't.

17:45.154 --> 17:46.834
It's a friend. Sorry.

17:48.874 --> 17:51.834
Thank you. Thanks.

17:55.114 --> 17:56.554
What room?

17:56.554 --> 17:58.634
Which floor?

18:05.514 --> 18:08.754
I'm just about to get concierge
up here! Open the door!

18:10.394 --> 18:14.154
He left.
You all right? What happened?

18:14.154 --> 18:17.074
Jesus, I'm having a heart attack!

18:17.074 --> 18:20.034
I'm so sorry about everything.
Fine, don't worry. What happened?

18:20.034 --> 18:25.274
This guy just opened the door
and he was really quiet,

18:25.274 --> 18:27.914
and I was gonna count the money,
but he stopped me,

18:27.914 --> 18:30.154
and I saw that the top one
was a twenty,

18:30.154 --> 18:32.354
but underneath that
they were all photocopies.

18:32.354 --> 18:34.194
Not even very good ones.

18:34.194 --> 18:36.394
Was this the man from my email
that you replied to?

18:39.394 --> 18:40.674
I knew it.

18:40.674 --> 18:44.434
He told me to take off my clothes,
but I wouldn't,

18:44.434 --> 18:48.514
and he got really angry
and he pulled my dress down,

18:48.514 --> 18:51.554
so I ran to the bathroom
and he just kept shouting at me.

18:51.554 --> 18:53.034
It's OK.

18:53.034 --> 18:54.634
It's OK. Come on. It's all right.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.354
(SOBS)

18:56.354 --> 18:58.594
It's OK.

18:58.594 --> 19:00.154
It's all right.

19:00.154 --> 19:01.634
(SOBS)

19:03.794 --> 19:06.434
We better go. He might come back.
Oh, my goodness.

19:06.434 --> 19:08.914
It's OK. It's fine.
Come on, just get it together.

19:28.274 --> 19:31.474
It's from ages ago.
I try and cover it.

19:38.554 --> 19:41.474
I didn't mess up your night, did I?
No, baby, don't worry about it.

19:43.554 --> 19:45.074
How did your date go?

19:45.074 --> 19:48.674
Well, he didn't assault me,
so better than yours.

19:48.674 --> 19:50.274
Come on.

20:03.594 --> 20:05.394
You should rethink this.

20:05.394 --> 20:08.194
I know I fucked up, but I can
change. I can get like you.

20:08.194 --> 20:10.154
No, no, you mustn't.

20:10.154 --> 20:13.474
That's exactly the attitude
that destroys you in this job.

20:13.474 --> 20:17.434
You can't let it take over, OK?
You can't let it change you.

20:20.314 --> 20:22.234
I need you to tell me
all about this bloke,

20:22.234 --> 20:24.074
so I can alert the other girls
on the net.

20:25.194 --> 20:26.994
# THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS:
Adventures In Solitude

20:26.994 --> 20:28.714
Can I maybe stay with you tonight?

20:39.074 --> 20:41.474
# Balancing on

20:41.474 --> 20:43.394
# One wounded wing

20:43.394 --> 20:44.754
# Circling the edge

20:44.754 --> 20:46.874
# Of the never ending

20:46.874 --> 20:49.554
# The best of the vanished

20:49.554 --> 20:53.914
# Marvels have gathered

20:56.074 --> 20:57.674
# More than begin

20:57.674 --> 20:59.274
# But less than forget

20:59.274 --> 21:00.754
# But spirits born...

21:00.754 --> 21:03.514
I know the job
is kind of taking over my life.

21:03.514 --> 21:06.834
And now it's taking over
other people's.

21:08.994 --> 21:11.114
But there's one thing that's normal
about me.

21:12.594 --> 21:15.234
One thing that's Hannah's,
not Belle's.

21:18.674 --> 21:20.354
Well, two things...

21:22.234 --> 21:24.074
..and maybe I shouldn't let them go.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.874
# Welcome back #

21:28.434 --> 21:30.674
This is the kind of girlfriend
I can be.

21:30.674 --> 21:33.154
What do they want?

21:33.154 --> 21:35.074
I hope
that you're thinking about me.

21:35.074 --> 21:37.394
I can't go out with you.
He's my husband.

21:37.394 --> 21:41.674
It's fucking over. It's nice to know
I have this affect on people.
