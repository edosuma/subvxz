00:01.335 --> 00:04.129
Previously on stargate atlantis...

00:04.463 --> 00:07.549
I could easily bring another 12 ships to the battle.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.219
12 ships, willing to fight shoulder to shoulder?

00:10.302 --> 00:13.096
For a chance to destroy the replicators once and for all?

00:13.222 --> 00:14.681
Of course.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.767
What did you do?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.852
- What are you referring to?
- There's a ship on the way.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.979
Ah, they picked up my signal.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.689
Subspace tracking device.

00:22.814 --> 00:23.565
Hello?

00:23.690 --> 00:24.983
Is anybody here?

00:25.067 --> 00:26.151
What happened?

00:26.276 --> 00:28.570
My people, they are gone.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.489
Searched the entire planet, no life-signs.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.031
I will find them.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.576
And we're going to help you, but you got to rest and get your strength back.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.079
Whoever did this will pay.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.790
I will make certain of it.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.010
I'm so sorry, teyla.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.637
Kanaan was a good man.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.847
He would have made a wonderful father.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.478
I really thought I could save him.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.814
You did everything you could.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.191
That's all anybody can ask for.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.568
He's at peace now.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.789
All right.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.958
I'm ready.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.924
Teyla...

02:14.468 --> 02:15.135
teyla!

02:15.260 --> 02:16.261
He's still alive!

02:16.386 --> 02:17.846
Help me, teyla, please!

02:18.055 --> 02:18.847
Please help me!

02:18.972 --> 02:20.515
He's still alive! Let me go!

02:20.640 --> 02:21.892
Teyla, it's too late.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.977
Help me, teyla! Teyla!

02:24.102 --> 02:25.270
Teyla...

02:26.396 --> 02:28.648
teyla!

03:51.773 --> 03:54.025
As you know, for some time now

03:54.151 --> 03:57.946
we've been tracking what appears to be a new sickness in the pegasus galaxy.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.948
We don't know exactly when or where it started,

04:00.073 --> 04:03.201
but so far we've encountered it on seven different planets.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.578
THE KINDRED

04:03.326 --> 04:04.703
Make that eight.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.122
We just came back from 447. They got it too.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.498
Really? The same symptoms?

04:08.623 --> 04:11.126
Mmm... starts with respiratory difficulty,

04:11.251 --> 04:14.171
proceeds rapidly to fatal organ shut down.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.047
Oh, it's, uh, disinfectant.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.757
We just came back from the bio-screen, rodney.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.635
We were wearing a hasmat the whole time, too.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.804
Yes, well, it's better safe than sorry.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.307
Do we have any idea how it's spread?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.350
Well, that's the strange part.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.686
Most of these planets have no regular contact with each other,

04:29.811 --> 04:33.148
but a few of them do have regular contact with other, neighboring planets

04:33.273 --> 04:34.900
that have been completely unaffected.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.860
So far.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.029
How bad is this going to get?

04:39.279 --> 04:43.700
If I had to make a projection, I'd base it on the evidence from m1r 992.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.785
There have been no new cases there for some time,

04:45.911 --> 04:48.663
which would seem to indicate the sickness has run its course.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.333
And?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.669
It killed 30% of the population.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.880
If those numbers bear out on the rest of these planets,

04:57.005 --> 04:59.257
we're looking at a death-toll of about

04:59.382 --> 05:00.967
200,000.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.679
That's assuming it doesn't spread any further.

05:17.901 --> 05:18.902
Rodney,

05:19.027 --> 05:21.821
has dr.Keller made any progress with her investigation?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.699
Unfortunately not, no, but she's still working on it.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.244
What are you hiding?

05:27.577 --> 05:28.787
I, um...

05:29.412 --> 05:30.038
well...

05:30.330 --> 05:32.541
I've been waiting for the right time to give this to you,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.502
and what with everything that's been going on and all, I, uh...

05:35.710 --> 05:37.295
anyway, uh...

05:37.796 --> 05:39.005
here you go.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.508
You didn't have to do this, rodney.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.968
Well, think of it as A...

05:43.051 --> 05:45.220
a kind of a pre-baby present.

05:45.929 --> 05:50.267
Back on earth, there's this company that produces recordings specifically for the fetus.

05:50.517 --> 05:54.479
The thinking is that by listening to the works of, say, a great composer

05:54.604 --> 05:58.400
while still in the womb, the baby will be born with a natural predisposition toward musical ability,

05:58.483 --> 06:01.069
or in this case, science.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.447
Yeah, I recorded some of my reflections on

06:04.531 --> 06:07.534
some of my more ground-breaking accomplishments and theories.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.119
Just a couple of hours' worth.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.787
You should not have gone to so much trouble.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.789
Oh, it was no trouble at all.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.169
Something wrong?

06:19.045 --> 06:20.171
Uh...

06:21.256 --> 06:23.717
I was debating whether or not to tell anyone.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.722
tell anyone what?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.183
I believe I had a vision last night.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.643
A vision?

06:33.768 --> 06:36.938
I saw kanaan, the father of my son.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.649
I believe that he was trying to

06:39.983 --> 06:42.527
send me a message, that he's alive,

06:42.819 --> 06:47.115
and that I must not abandon the search for him and the rest of my people.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.951
And-and this was while you were sleeping?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.829
You think it was a dream.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.080
Well, I...

06:54.205 --> 06:56.583
I believe it was more than that.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.294
It did not feel like a dream.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.175
I knew you would doubt me. I should not have said anything.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.803
Hey, I've been cocooned inside an alien space craft, I've had another person living inside me,

07:08.928 --> 07:10.764
I've encountered not one, but two different versions of myself,

07:10.889 --> 07:12.015
so who am I to judge?

07:12.140 --> 07:14.601
If you say it was a vision, then I believe it was a vision.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.311
I seriously doubt it was a vision.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
She had them before.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.231
She's had remote contact with the wraith, never another human.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.401
Besides, those athosians have been missing for, like, what, six months now?

07:23.526 --> 07:24.444
You really think they're still alive?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.488
What do you want me to do, rodney?
Tell her to give up hope?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.323
At some point, she may not have a choice.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.450
Rodney, ****

08:23.420 --> 08:25.422
Kanaan...

08:28.758 --> 08:30.427
teyla?

08:35.097 --> 08:36.683
You must help us.

08:37.726 --> 08:38.518
How?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.102
Save us.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.897
Where are you? Where are our people?

08:47.026 --> 08:48.486
You bought me this.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.571
Yes.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.822
Do you remember where?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.824
The village of croya.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.784
Is that where you are?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.953
Come find me.

09:13.178 --> 09:17.891
She says the pendant in her vision is the same one she gave to kanaan before he disappeared.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.768
So what's the significance?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.478
Well, uh...

09:22.061 --> 09:23.605
I'm not sure.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.648
Well, what does she want, exactly?

09:25.774 --> 09:28.735
Well, she bought it from some guy in a village on m2s 181.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.361
She wants to go back and check it out.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.738
That's a peaceful trading settlement.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.200
I'd be very surprised if they had anything to do with the disappearance of the athosians.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.035
That's what I said, but she still wants to go.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.536
She thinks that

09:38.661 --> 09:41.623
kanaan is sending her a message, a clue.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.624
And what do you think?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.042
Doesn't matter.

09:44.167 --> 09:47.128
It's teyla, and we owe her one.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.130
Okay

09:49.255 --> 09:51.466
but we're stretched pretty thin dealing with this plague.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.260
We'll try to make it quick.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.399
I purchased the pendant from an artisan in croya,

10:08.650 --> 10:10.777
the village we are about to visit.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.614
Among the athosians, it's quite common to present such gifts

10:14.739 --> 10:17.659
as expressions of admiration and respect.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.703
Hey, maybe I'll pick you something up while we're there.

10:20.829 --> 10:21.704
Really?

10:21.830 --> 10:22.622
No.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.542
All right, so we'll ask around see if we can get some useful intel,

10:25.667 --> 10:28.545
but if you even begin to sense any danger--

10:28.670 --> 10:31.881
I'll make straight for the gate, leaving you to deal with it.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.425
All right, then.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.900
Excuse me,

10:50.984 --> 10:55.405
I'm wondering if you can tell me what happened to the artisan who used to occupy this space.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.700
He specialized in handcrafted jewelry,

10:58.825 --> 11:01.494
bracelets, pendants, chains...

11:01.619 --> 11:02.996
he's gone.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.706
Gone?

11:05.039 --> 11:08.376
During the sickness that took the village several weeks back.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.920
He and some 40 others.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.048
I'm sorry, child, he's dead.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.847
Hey, I hear you have something.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.348
Yeah.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.767
I found out what's making these people sick,

11:24.893 --> 11:27.604
and it's something we've encountered before.

11:29.939 --> 11:34.068
It's a unique protein originally created by the inhabitants of a planet called hoff.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.654
It was designed to interfere with the wraith's feeding mechanism,

11:36.779 --> 11:38.448
making them immune to the process.

11:38.573 --> 11:41.117
It also killed the feeding wraith, and half the people who took it.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.076
That's right.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.829
So this isn't some contagion that spreads naturally.

11:44.954 --> 11:45.914
No.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.540
This is mass murder.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.217
I think we're done here.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.093
Not yet.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.428
I've given this place the twice over.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.763
Nobody knows anything.

12:01.846 --> 12:05.183
Well, perhaps someone does, and has not yet seen fit to come forward yet.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.811
I was guided here.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.732
By showing me the pendant, kanaan was telling me to come to this village.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.901
Look, you're going through a tough time.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.403
You want answers, that's understandable,

12:17.528 --> 12:19.614
but you might want to consider it's clouding your judgment.

12:19.989 --> 12:20.907
Just a little.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.700
What are you questioning, john?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.370
My interpretation of the vision, or the vision itself?

12:25.495 --> 12:26.454
We've been here long enough.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.706
If there was something for us to find, we would've found it by now.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.879
Rodney, ronon, we're heading out.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.675
Are you sure it's the same protein?

12:38.925 --> 12:42.261
I ran a side-by-side comparison.
It was almost an exact match.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.096
Almost?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.765
We're dealing with the new and improved version.

12:45.848 --> 12:51.145
The hoffan drug killed roughly 50% of the test subjects, and this one only kills 30%.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.398
Yeah, it's still 30% too many.

12:53.523 --> 12:57.110
How do the populations of eight different planets get inoculated with a drug and not even know about it?

12:57.402 --> 13:00.822
It's possible it was administered through their food and water supply.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.115
We're running some tests.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.700
So who's behind this?

13:03.825 --> 13:06.494
Well, maybe the hoffans have resumed distribution of the drug,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.371
but on a much larger scale.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.498
They haven't been doing much of anything lately.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.501
When the wraith discovered what they were up to, the whole civilization was wiped out.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.171
Well, maybe a few of them survived, and they're planning a little payback.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.926
The random nature of this drug's distribution is clear and calculated.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.221
It's obviously intended to throw the wraith completely off balance.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.682
They have no way of knowing which of their food sources has been infected.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.394
So it's just a matter of time before they become hungry and cranky.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.981
Well, I mean, I know I would.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.066
We need to go back to hoff,

13:37.191 --> 13:41.863
search what's still standing, see if we can shed some light on the situation before another planet's targeted.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.990
Let's go, rodney.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.382
Teyla...

14:02.967 --> 14:05.094
kanaan...

14:05.219 --> 14:06.554
where are you?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.097
I don't know.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.224
Who took you?

14:10.475 --> 14:11.976
I don't know.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.604
How can I find you?

14:14.729 --> 14:17.273
You already know where to go to uncover the answers.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.650
The village.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.110
But you stopped looking.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.195
I went.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.696
I found nothing.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.198
You were close.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.824
Please, teyla.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.701
Our time is running short.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.791
We need you.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.251
Kanaan...

14:53.810 --> 14:55.103
and you weren't sleeping?

14:55.228 --> 14:58.147
I was in a meditative state, but I was most definitely awake.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.067
There can be no doubt.
This is real.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.777
But you've already been to the planet.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.154
We missed something. I'm certain of it.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.241
I want to believe you, teyla, but I'm a scientist.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.826
I'm trained to think critically.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.411
There is a possible explanation.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.706
Kanaan has the gift, the same ability that I do.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.166
The wraith dna.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.292
Yes.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.504
Among my people, the gift is considered useful,

15:21.587 --> 15:24.340
but it also sets one apart. It can be difficult.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.468
Kanaan was the only one who could truly understand what it felt like.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.303
It brought you together.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.973
It is something we have shared since childhood.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.976
But have you ever communicated this way before?

15:35.601 --> 15:36.727
No.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.605
I know what this looks like, colonel,

15:39.689 --> 15:41.566
and I know what everyone is thinking.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.778
"She sees what she wants to see, she believes what she wants to believe,"

15:46.028 --> 15:49.157
but I assure you, that is not the case.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.453
All right.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.248
- When colonel sheppard gets back from hoff, we can--
- I cannot wait.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.877
Kanaan said their time is running short. I must leave immediately.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.211
I see.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.845
I do not need your permission, colonel.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.223
Unless you intend to restrain me.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.021
Major lorne, come in.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.856
Go ahead, colonel.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.484
Assemble your team. You'll be escorting teyla back to m2s 181.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.819
Understood.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.864
I'm not letting you go back there alone.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.282
Thank you, colonel.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.950
Call me sam.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.204
Thank you, sam.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.304
Rodney, come in.

16:53.763 --> 16:54.931
Go ahead.

16:55.056 --> 16:55.932
Did you find anything?

16:56.057 --> 16:57.433
Just a bunch of junk. You?

16:57.725 --> 16:58.809
Nothing.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.812
The wraith did a pretty good number on this place.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.648
Yeah, this is more than just random destruction.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.817
This place used to be the repository of all hoffan knowledge.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.653
I'd say a lot of it's just missing.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.489
Who's there?

17:11.614 --> 17:12.906
Rodney, what's going on?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.117
I thought I heard something.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.161
Relax.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.871
Probably just rats.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.498
Rats?

17:23.334 --> 17:25.795
Okay, if there's someone in here, you better come out.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.595
I'm not kidding.

17:54.949 --> 17:55.866
Hang on

17:55.992 --> 17:58.286
I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to ask you a couple of questions.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.454
Now, who are you? What are you doing here?

18:01.789 --> 18:05.251
Okay, maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for some medical stuff. Books, files, equipment.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.586
I don't know anything about that.

18:07.712 --> 18:11.257
By the time we got here, most of the good stuff was already gone.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.093
We're just picking through what's left.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.636
Sheppard...

18:19.223 --> 18:21.017
Looks like we're not the only ones here.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.560
What do you got?

18:22.685 --> 18:25.146
A bunch of kids going through what's left of this place.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.232
Scavengers. You think they got a hold of what we're looking for?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.860
Hoffan research wouldn't have meant anything to them.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.570
All right, well, if not them, then who was it?

18:32.695 --> 18:34.155
I don't know.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.198
One thing's for sure, whoever it was,

18:36.324 --> 18:38.784
they knew exactly what they were looking for.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.088
kind of reminds me of the flea markets they used to have back home.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.758
Every sunday, stroll down to the bay area,

18:53.883 --> 18:56.385
find pretty much anything you wanted,

18:56.677 --> 19:00.222
and a lot of things you didn'T.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.561
What is it?

19:11.525 --> 19:12.985
Teyla?

19:15.654 --> 19:16.947
Leave.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.788
I will ask you once, and you will answer me truthfully.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.414
Where did you get this pendant?

19:25.539 --> 19:26.874
From a trader.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.336
If you like it that much, it's yours with my blessings.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.714
You recognize it?

19:34.465 --> 19:36.258
It belonged to kanaan.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.304
What else did you acquire from this trader?

19:49.063 --> 19:50.648
You know, I don't want to be difficult here,

19:50.773 --> 19:53.192
but I did acquire that merchandise for a price,

19:53.317 --> 19:55.611
and while I really don't mind gifting you with an item,

19:55.736 --> 19:59.031
from a purely business standpoint, it really doesn't make sense for me to part with my stock--

19:59.115 --> 20:02.201
this necklace belonged to bellara.

20:02.493 --> 20:05.830
It was a gift from her parents to mark her coming of age,

20:06.789 --> 20:08.374
and this ring

20:09.083 --> 20:10.960
belonged to halling.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.045
This trader you say you got these things from.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.547
When's the last time you saw him?

20:14.672 --> 20:15.506
Several days ago,

20:15.631 --> 20:17.341
but he comes through here quite regularly.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.177
In fact, it's more than likely he may pay me a visit today.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.807
It would be my pleasure to make the proper introductions.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.524
Anything?

20:33.649 --> 20:35.443
No, the place was cleared out.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.111
Is that what I think it is?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.946
It's getting to be a familiar sight.

20:39.071 --> 20:39.822
What is it?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.699
Wraith subspace tracking device.

20:41.824 --> 20:42.825
It's our old friend.

20:42.950 --> 20:43.784
Todd.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.163
Maybe he wants to talk, and maybe he just wants to lead us into an ambush.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.831
There is always that possibility.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.083
Well, there's only one way to find out.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.210
Aw, come on, we just got back.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.962
Sorry, rodney.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.465
I haven't even had lunch yet.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.676
Dial it.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.991
Got some real nice merchandise for you today, my friend.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.868
Real nice.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.955
Hey there, how you doing?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.708
You mind telling me where you got this stuff?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.493
Wake up.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.538
Look, we need to know

22:10.663 --> 22:13.749
where you got this merchandise.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.586
I do trade so much, it's often hard to keep track of it all.

22:17.711 --> 22:18.629
Oh yeah?

22:18.754 --> 22:20.756
Well, according to the merchant you do business with here,

22:20.881 --> 22:22.424
the stuff you've been bringing in lately

22:22.550 --> 22:25.302
has been a hell of a lot nicer than your usual crap.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.512
He said that?

22:26.595 --> 22:27.763
Yeah, he said that.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.099
Well, there's no accounting for taste.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.853
I can't give up my sources. They're trade secrets.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.565
I don't give a damn about your trade secrets.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.150
We want to know where you got this stuff.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.987
And if I don't tell you? What are you going to do?

22:43.237 --> 22:45.864
I recognize those uniforms, I've heard the stories.

22:45.990 --> 22:49.994
People from atlantis, do-gooders of the galaxy.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.162
You wouldn't hurt me.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.164
I'm wearing no uniform.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.296
A pregnant woman.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.381
Very intimidating.

23:06.677 --> 23:10.014
I will inform the villers that you are a wraith worshiper,

23:10.139 --> 23:11.557
and let them mete out their own justice.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.725
Let's go.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.685
Wait

23:18.314 --> 23:21.108
I got it at an off-world dumping ground.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.735
Dumping ground?

23:22.985 --> 23:24.403
For what?

23:24.903 --> 23:26.614
Corpses, mostly.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.158
Loose ends that need to be disappeared.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.702
Occasionally they may still have some valuables on them,

23:31.827 --> 23:34.496
valuables they obviously have no use for.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.041
This merchandise, you removed it from the dead?

23:37.082 --> 23:40.336
No, not that merchandise.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.925
The last time I was back at the planet,

23:47.051 --> 23:51.722
I spotted what I thought was a fresh grave, a potential new opportunity,

23:52.056 --> 23:54.183
but when i dug it up, instead of finding a body,

23:54.308 --> 23:56.435
I found a box containing those items.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.271
I suppose somebody was just trying to get rid of them.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.482
It was odd to me at first, but I wasn't just about to--

24:01.607 --> 24:03.776
you will take us to this world.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.278
You will show us where you found them.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.072
Of course.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.157
Whatever you say.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.868
Get him up.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.189
Sheppard. We got something.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.080
Well, they're dead,

24:58.205 --> 24:59.665
but there's no marks on them.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.126
That's because they were poisoned...

25:05.629 --> 25:08.549
and I suspect you already know how.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.892
First thing we do when we get to the gate is radio back to atlantis,

25:19.017 --> 25:21.228
let them know where we're going, okay?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.857
Listen, teyla,

25:24.982 --> 25:27.943
I know you're looking for answers to what happened to your people, but

25:28.527 --> 25:31.613
I'm thinking maybe it's better if you let us check it out, okay?

25:31.739 --> 25:32.448
Major...

25:32.573 --> 25:35.075
look, just let us scout ahead, all right?

25:36.827 --> 25:37.578
What is that?

25:37.703 --> 25:38.829
Dart!

25:49.757 --> 25:51.800
Well, let me guess...

25:52.009 --> 25:53.385
something they ate?

25:53.510 --> 25:57.347
Many of my fellow wraith have fallen victim to this attack on our food supply.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.184
Yeah, it's a shame, but it's not really our problem.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.186
From what we've been able to surmise,

26:02.311 --> 26:05.647
this blow against us has been delivered at a great cost to human lives.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.525
Something you would have made your problem in the past...

26:09.193 --> 26:13.030
unless, of course, you're responsible for the dispersal of this plague,

26:13.155 --> 26:16.742
in which case, you may well consider the human lives sacrificed

26:16.867 --> 26:18.368
acceptable losses?

26:18.619 --> 26:22.164
Actually, when we were putting a list together of the most likely suspects,

26:22.289 --> 26:23.665
you were at the top.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.294
What better way to stick it to your competition?

26:27.669 --> 26:29.505
Effective, yes,

26:29.630 --> 26:31.381
and admittedly creative,

26:31.507 --> 26:32.591
but the truth is,

26:32.716 --> 26:36.261
all of the existing wraith factions have been adversely affected by this.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.598
Our food supply has been so randomly tainted

26:39.723 --> 26:43.101
we have no way of knowing if our next meal will be our last.

26:43.227 --> 26:45.896
All right, times are tough.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.816
Doesn't explain why you called us here.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.652
I brought you here because...

26:52.361 --> 26:54.154
I need your help.

26:55.823 --> 26:59.451
I am aware you had a hand in helping the hoffans refine this drug.

26:59.576 --> 27:03.789
I require whatever research you possess in order that I may synthesize a cure,

27:03.914 --> 27:05.290
for my hive

27:05.374 --> 27:07.167
and my hive alone.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.169
That's not going to happen.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.756
You always say that, but you always come around.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.341
Yeah, well, this is different.

27:14.466 --> 27:18.554
We're still a little upset over the whole earth conquest thing.

27:18.679 --> 27:19.888
I had no part in that.

27:20.013 --> 27:22.224
Actually, in an indirect way, you did.

27:22.349 --> 27:27.104
The wraith who led the attack was able to access the midway station with information you stole on your last visit to atlantis.

27:27.229 --> 27:31.233
Information he stole from me in turn, so, in a way, we were both victims,

27:31.608 --> 27:34.194
but let's save our commiserations for another time.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.405
I have a proposal.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.740
Let's hear it.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.243
In exchange for this information,

27:41.243 --> 27:45.622
I will give you the identity of the individual responsible for dispersing this poison

27:45.747 --> 27:48.750
and killing both wraith and human alike.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.670
A couple of minutes ago, you thought we did it.

27:51.795 --> 27:56.717
There are only two parties who possess the resources and capabilities to launch such an attack.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.927
If you are not responsible, then,

27:59.011 --> 28:01.346
by process of elimination,

28:02.347 --> 28:05.267
there can be only one.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.621
Michael.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.711
Wraith faction has been hit

28:32.836 --> 28:35.380
which makes it extremely unlikely that any of them are responsible.

28:35.505 --> 28:38.759
When we told him we weren't the guys behind it, he said there can only be one other.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.094
And you think you know who he's talking about?

28:42.137 --> 28:43.513
Michael.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.183
The wraith that dr.Beckett converted into a human?

28:46.308 --> 28:48.018
Well, temporarily converted.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.521
Eventually, he became a kind of a human-wraith hybrid.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.231
The other wraith didn't want anything to do with him,

28:53.357 --> 28:55.734
so he's been kind of holding a little bit of a grudge ever since.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.402
He's not a big fan of humans, either.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.072
No, for him, the hoffan drug is the perfect weapon.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.949
Still, this is just speculation.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.368
I mean, do we have any proof?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.995
Well, not really, but even if we did, we'd have no way of finding him.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.873
We can go back to todd, see if he's got something more than a name.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.794
Well, wait, you're not seriously thinking of giving him our research on the hoffan protein?

29:13.919 --> 29:15.045
Well, why not?

29:15.212 --> 29:19.132
Because we'd effectively be giving the wraith the means to reproduce the drug and

29:19.257 --> 29:21.093
potentially infect and kill millions--

29:21.218 --> 29:22.344
theoretically, yes,

29:22.469 --> 29:25.889
but practically, it really wouldn't be in their best interest to poison their own food supply,

29:26.014 --> 29:28.850
regardless of whether our research helped them come up with an antidote or not.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.186
No, I think the more likely scenario is that

29:31.269 --> 29:34.648
they find an antidote that works as a short-term solution to the existing threat,

29:34.731 --> 29:36.817
then they work on weaponizing the protein.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.111
You know, coming up with a more effective delivery system,

29:39.194 --> 29:40.737
one that cuts out the middle man,

29:40.862 --> 29:42.906
in this case, the human victims.

29:43.031 --> 29:46.868
No, what we're doing is giving them the means to kill each other off.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.662
So, when you, uh...

29:48.787 --> 29:52.708
put it that way, giving them our research could be a good thing.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.544
Incoming wormhole.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.391
Major, where's teyla?

30:12.060 --> 30:13.854
Why am I here?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.689
What do you want?

30:17.482 --> 30:18.650
Answer me!

30:18.775 --> 30:20.736
I'm disappointed.

30:20.986 --> 30:25.991
I was expecting a little more gratitude, after everything I went through to arrange this...

30:26.074 --> 30:27.451
family reunion.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.910
Reunion?

30:32.164 --> 30:33.957
My people...

30:34.166 --> 30:35.959
you took them?

30:37.878 --> 30:39.254
Where are they?

30:39.337 --> 30:40.172
What have you done with them?

30:40.297 --> 30:42.215
They're alive and well,

30:42.340 --> 30:45.927
and working with me toward the common goal we all share.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.513
What are you talking about?

30:52.768 --> 30:55.812
The extermination of the wraith.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.441
I'm building an army that will soon replace them

30:59.566 --> 31:02.694
as the dominant race in this galaxy.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.030
An army of monsters.

31:05.155 --> 31:08.992
I'll admit my early attempts were a little...

31:09.117 --> 31:10.368
crude,

31:10.494 --> 31:12.412
but that's all changed now.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.791
I've refined the retrovirus to create the perfect balance,

31:15.916 --> 31:20.295
ability well beyond any normal human, but without the one weakness

31:20.420 --> 31:23.590
that will be the downfall of the wraith.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.555
The need to feed.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.225
It was you.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.936
You're the one responsible for spreading the hoffan drug.

31:36.061 --> 31:40.565
Consider it the opening salvo in a much broader assault.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.735
How were you able to discover the drug?

31:44.402 --> 31:46.696
How were you able to refine it?

31:48.448 --> 31:51.034
I had help.

31:55.205 --> 31:58.542
Wait! Where are my people?

31:59.501 --> 32:01.670
Michael!

32:18.228 --> 32:20.147
Oh, don't mind them.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.691
They're just here to help with the clean-up.

32:27.195 --> 32:30.407
I assume you've agreed to my terms?

32:33.451 --> 32:34.786
Not exactly.

32:34.911 --> 32:39.040
You do not wish to know who's responsible for these unfortunate events?

32:39.166 --> 32:40.709
We already know.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.586
At least, we have a pretty good guess.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.296
We call him michael.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.839
Don't ask why.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.258
He used to be a wraith. Now he's A...

32:48.842 --> 32:50.594
I'm not sure what the hell he is.

32:50.719 --> 32:54.181
I know the one of whom you speak, and I believe you are correct.

32:54.389 --> 32:58.185
Confirmation, without us giving you anything.
That's very generous.

32:59.102 --> 33:02.189
Obviously there's more you want from me, or you would not have come.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.149
Maybe we just came to kill you.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.066
Did you?

33:05.066 --> 33:07.194
Unfortunately, no.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.447
Well, there's always next time.

33:10.447 --> 33:11.656
Rodney...

33:12.824 --> 33:14.326
one of our people,

33:14.451 --> 33:15.410
teyla,

33:15.660 --> 33:17.204
was taken by a dart today.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.707
I suppose she's already made some lucky wraith a very tasty meal.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.459
This was no culling.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.377
She was targeted. Someone set a trap.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.047
And you suspect this... what do you call him?

33:27.172 --> 33:27.881
Michael?

33:28.006 --> 33:30.800
Well, if not, the timing's a hell of a coincidence.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.887
We need you to tap your intel sources,

33:34.012 --> 33:36.306
find something useful.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.604
This tablet has the address of an off-world relay station.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.273
If you leave a message for us, we'll get it.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.026
It also has our research on the hoffan drug.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.029
just enough to whet your appetite.

33:51.154 --> 33:55.659
You find something we can use, we'll give you the rest.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.328
Well, I'll see what I can do.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.399
I understand you're refusing to take food.

34:28.817 --> 34:32.112
It's not poisoned, if that's what you're worried about.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.414
Take it.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.583
You need to keep up your strength.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.341
What do you care about my well-being?

34:54.050 --> 34:56.594
I care a great deal.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.809
I may not be foolish enough to consider us friends,

35:02.934 --> 35:05.061
but we do have a history...

35:05.186 --> 35:07.314
and even though you've betrayed me repeatedly,

35:07.439 --> 35:10.358
you're still the only one, human or wraith,

35:10.483 --> 35:13.445
who's ever come close to understanding what I've been through.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.654
Really?

35:14.779 --> 35:17.449
We're not that different, teyla.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.452
You're a human with wraith dna.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.996
A hybrid, just like me.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.415
I'm no murderer.

35:26.207 --> 35:30.086
You kill to protect yourself and your own, so do I.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.840
Of course, circumstances require me to do it on a slightly larger scale,

35:33.965 --> 35:36.259
but the principle is still the same.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.346
You're insane.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.894
Spite me all you want,

35:47.520 --> 35:50.231
but don't do it at the expense of the child.

35:52.692 --> 35:57.322
My child is of no concern to you.

35:57.447 --> 36:00.116
On the contrary,

36:01.368 --> 36:03.953
I have great plans for him.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.971
How can you eat right now?

36:22.097 --> 36:22.889
Are you kidding?

36:23.014 --> 36:24.808
This is the first decent meal I've had all day.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.394
Besides, it's not going to help teyla at all starving ourselves.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.563
I'm just trying to keep my strength up.
I suggest you two do the same.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.524
Hey, we'll find her.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.275
I've just got to do something.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.860
Colonel...

36:35.985 --> 36:37.862
looks like todd came through for you.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.613
He did?

36:38.738 --> 36:40.573
You've got a message from the relay station.

36:40.698 --> 36:45.328
Apparently there's a rumor going around amongst certain wraith worshipers about one of our people being held captive.

36:45.662 --> 36:46.871
You've got the coordinates.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.581
All right, I'm going to need lorne and his team.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.083
He's already volunteered.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.794
You'll gate to the nearest planet, where the daedalus is enroute to pick you up.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.129
Let's go.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.305
I told you, I'm not hungry.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.813
Kanaan...

37:13.690 --> 37:15.900
what has he done to you?

37:16.443 --> 37:19.404
Kanaan, it's me. Teyla.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.073
I came for you, just like you asked.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.826
Like I asked.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.997
I was the one in your visions.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.416
Appropriately disguised, of course.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.042
You're lying.

37:33.168 --> 37:36.963
I reached across 10,000 light years of space and touched your mind.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.215
There is more of a bond between us than you know.

37:39.674 --> 37:43.470
Once the child is born, the bond will grow even stronger.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.600
Enjoy your reunion.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.441
Kanaan, you must help me.

37:57.150 --> 37:59.360
You must help our child.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.404
Please, kanaan.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.865
The child will serve the cause,

38:04.741 --> 38:08.286
then one day soon, the galaxy will be ours.

38:25.970 --> 38:26.971
Colonel...

38:27.096 --> 38:28.097
sheppard.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.682
Approaching target destination.

38:29.807 --> 38:30.600
Drop us out.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.185
Yes, sir.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.702
We're unable to get a lock on her subcutaneous transmitter.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.038
No surprise there. I'm sure michael got rid of that.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.831
Guess we'll have to do things the hard way.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.334
Good, let's do it.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.221
All right, stay in touch.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.138
Yes, sir.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.307
Let's move out.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.798
Sir, I'm picking up another ship.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.425
It's a wraith cruiser, sir.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.093
Shields up.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.061
Return fire!

40:39.228 --> 40:41.731
Sheppard, this is daedalus.
We've been engaged by a wraith cruiser.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.232
How's it going?

40:43.316 --> 40:46.235
More than holding our own, but you could pick up the pace.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.363
Where's your boss?

40:55.787 --> 40:56.996
You're too early.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.831
What the hell does that mean?

40:59.957 --> 41:01.959
We're expecting him back.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.255
He's on his way with an important prisoner.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.930
This is sheppard, come in.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.015
Daedalus, do you read?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.517
Sheppard, this is daedalus.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.852
Do not destroy the enemy ship.
I repeat

41:19.936 --> 41:23.064
do not destroy the enemy ship. 
Teyla may be on board.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.441
Did you hear me? Teyla may be on board!

41:27.276 --> 41:29.195
We heard you. Can you cripple it?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.447
It's possible, sir. It's already sustained some heavy damage.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.408
Sir, the enemy is attempting a retreat.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.952
Target the engines!

41:44.502 --> 41:45.920
I'm sorry, sir.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.923
Bad news, sheppard.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.300
The cruiser made the jump to hyperspace.

41:51.426 --> 41:53.469
It's gone.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.617
Any sign of her, sir?

42:16.743 --> 42:17.785
She's not here.

42:17.910 --> 42:18.494
Are you sure?

42:18.619 --> 42:21.664
That guard was protecting something.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.813
Finally! It's about bloody time.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.691
What took you so long?
