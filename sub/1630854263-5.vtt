WEBVTT

00:11.179 --> 00:13.514
This is my desk, my chair.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.882
A picture of Grover, Gemma,

00:14.982 --> 00:17.085
and me and my best friend,
of course.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.752
Dave...

00:18.852 --> 00:21.055
You took a picture of me
while I was asleep?

00:23.391 --> 00:24.692
Is that drool?

00:24.792 --> 00:26.627
You never pose for selfies.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.562
Sometimes you gotta do
what you gotta do.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.864
Then I gotta do this.

00:33.201 --> 00:36.337
You know, it's exciting
to have a visitor at my J-O-B.

00:36.437 --> 00:40.474
Well, I'm excited you offered
to take me out to E-A-T.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.276
Not out, down.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.644
Cafeteria's in the basement.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.646
Today is Brunswick stew.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.349
Brunswick stew in a basement.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.784
Well, I'm glad
I drove across town.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.622
I'm just kidding, man.
I'm actually happy for you.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.157
Ooh. There's my boss, Gregory.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.858
I'm up for a promotion

00:57.958 --> 00:59.393
and he's the one who decides
whether or not I get it,

00:59.493 --> 01:01.195
so be nice.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.763
I'm always nice.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.898
Be nicer than that.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.335
Hey, Gregory!

01:07.435 --> 01:08.636
Uh, brought a friend in

01:08.736 --> 01:10.538
for Stews Day Tuesday.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.539
This is Cal...

01:11.639 --> 01:12.940
Where's his ID?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.175
It's in my pocket.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.244
Yeah, it needs to be
on your person.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.846
My pocket is
on my person.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.883
Civilians, am I
right? Come on, Calvin.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.518
That Brunswick stew's not
going to eat itself.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.553
It was nice to meet you, Greg.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.521
Oh, God...

01:29.290 --> 01:31.625
Not "Greg." Gregory.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.327
Greg is my son.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.196
He goes by Greg to spite me.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.930
Doesn't work.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.269
Well, how you feel
about "G-Money"?

01:41.369 --> 01:42.470
Not good.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.637
All right.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.539
Ha! I'm starving.
Come on, Calvin.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.941
Let's go. Now.
Let's go. Come on.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.910
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:50.010 --> 01:51.612
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

01:55.015 --> 01:58.386
So this is what
a teachers' lounge looks like.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.289
Hmm. Is it everything
you imagined?
Oh, yes, Gemma.

02:01.389 --> 02:05.058
Smells like bad coffee,
sensible shoes and low pay.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.995
Oh, by the way,

02:08.095 --> 02:09.830
you should probably
call me Mrs. Johnson.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.365
If the other teachers
know you're my friend,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.201
they might think that
that's how you got the job.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.368
Oh, yeah.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.204
Because everybody knows
you don't get to be

02:16.237 --> 02:18.206
a part-time after-school
music teacher

02:18.239 --> 02:20.908
unless you know people
in high places.

02:22.075 --> 02:25.246
Good afternoon,
brilliant educators!

02:25.346 --> 02:26.714
Ms. Davis, Mr. Ryan,

02:26.814 --> 02:28.849
meet our new after-school
music teacher, Mrs. Butler.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.219
Ooh. Bus duty. Tootles!

02:34.121 --> 02:36.524
Welcome. Please
call me Tammy.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.692
And I'm Scott.
Oh. And I'm Tina.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.262
But Ms. Butler, if you're nasty.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.130
Oh, I see you.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.298
You're fun.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.501
First thing
you need to know:

02:47.601 --> 02:48.969
bring your own
toilet paper.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.838
It might as well be
sandpaper up in here.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.541
And if you know
what's good for you,

02:53.641 --> 02:55.008
stay away from the baked goods.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.077
Coach Spits has to touch
every one of them

02:57.245 --> 02:58.646
and he never washes his hands.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.947
Ooh, damn.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.616
That is so wrong.
Mm-hmm.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.984
Well, I'm excited to be here.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.753
I'm so happy that Gemma--

03:05.853 --> 03:07.588
Mrs. Johnson--
gave me the opportunity.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.722
Oh, isn't she great?

03:08.822 --> 03:09.723
So great.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.924
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.159
But, like, come on.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.295
No one can be that sunny
all of the time.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.931
:
"Good afternoon,
brilliant educators!

03:18.031 --> 03:19.933
"Remember, if we
inspire these kids,

03:20.033 --> 03:21.402
they'll inspire us back!"

03:21.502 --> 03:24.037
She is all
sunshine and rainbows.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.375
No one can really be
that perky.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.576
It's gotta be fake.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.043
And could she be
more uptight?

03:30.143 --> 03:31.645
"Ooh!

03:31.745 --> 03:32.913
"Remember, everybody.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.815
If you're not early,
you're late."

03:37.285 --> 03:38.619
Well, I-I think
Principal Johnson...

03:38.719 --> 03:41.389
Oh, when she's not around,
it's "Principal Barbie."

03:44.992 --> 03:46.794
We're high-fiving that?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.329
All right.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.137
Ooh, hey, Calvin.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.639
I got it.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.641
Well, I'm sure there's
an ointment out there

04:00.741 --> 04:02.643
to get rid of it.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.380
No, I'm saying
I got the promotion.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.181
Well, all right!

04:08.316 --> 04:10.518
Next lunch is on you,
Mr. Big Shot.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.321
And we're going to a restaurant
with cloth napkins.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.490
Okay, sure, but the new job pays
the same as the old one.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.326
And with all my
new responsibilities,

04:18.392 --> 04:19.893
I don't think
I'm gonna have the time

04:19.993 --> 04:21.228
to slip out for lunch as often.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.196
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.899
More work? Same pay?

04:25.999 --> 04:28.669
Do you know what a promotion is?

04:29.537 --> 04:31.905
Yes, but it's not
about the money.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.641
Look, when I was
a conflict mediator,

04:33.741 --> 04:35.208
yes, I got paid well.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.878
But listening to
rich people fight

04:37.978 --> 04:39.880
over who gets
which yacht was...

04:39.980 --> 04:41.349
I don't know,
kind of soul-crushing.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.250
Now I get to
counsel veterans.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.986
And helping people has
always been my passion.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.655
Dave,

04:47.755 --> 04:49.990
fixing cars is my passion,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.959
but you know what
my other passion is?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.362
Getting paid to fix cars.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.164
Yes, okay, a bit more
money would be nice,

04:57.264 --> 04:59.166
but it's the government. There's
not a lot of wiggle room.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.370
There's always wiggle room
in any negotiation.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.837
Houses, cars,

05:03.937 --> 05:06.106
even those guys selling fruit
on the side of the highway.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.476
They gotta make a deal
before that light changes.

05:09.577 --> 05:12.480
I don't know. Gregory just
gave me the promotion.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.247
Okay, would you stop being
such a people pleaser?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.584
Well, if it makes
you happy...
Stop it.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.754
Look, you don't want
to be taken advantage of.

05:20.854 --> 05:21.922
Speak up for yourself.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.391
Closed mouths don't get fed.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.792
Now come on.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.027
I'm going to show you how
to negotiate to get results.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.062
All right?
Let's act this out.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.631
You be your boss,
I'll be you.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.999
Ooh, role-play.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.402
Second time this week.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.004
I really didn't need
to know that.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.573
Come on, now, let's focus. Okay.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.308
Hi!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.244
I'm Dave Johnson.

05:44.412 --> 05:48.315
I like kittens, matcha
and really short shorts.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.483
Ooh.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.152
That was good.
I do like kittens.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.088
Okay, Dave, would you
get into character?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.558
Well, now you sound
just like Gemma.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.295
So the teachers at school
didn't know Gemma was my friend.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.665
And they just started
talking trash about her.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.966
Really? What'd they say?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.668
How she's so nice.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.338
Those monsters.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.274
You weren't there.

06:14.442 --> 06:17.645
And they said she was all
sunshine and rainbows.

06:17.745 --> 06:21.181
Okay, Mom, help me out here.
What's the problem?

06:21.281 --> 06:23.451
They clowned the way she talks.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.319
Ooh, and they called her
"Principal Barbie."

06:26.454 --> 06:28.021
Okay, that was rude.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.189
So I gotta tell her, right?

06:29.289 --> 06:31.459
Yes, you do.
She has got to know.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.660
What's wrong with you?
I can't do that.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.227
That'll just hurt her feelings.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.096
You're right.
Just keep it to yourself.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.731
Are you out of your damn mind?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.468
And not let her know what people
are saying right under her nose?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.471
Yeah?
No?

06:43.571 --> 06:44.872
You two are no help.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.173
What did...

06:46.273 --> 06:48.476
: If you want me
to take this job,

06:48.542 --> 06:51.278
there are some things you're
gonna have to understand, Greg.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.182
He doesn't like the name
Greg. He prefers Gregory.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.484
No, Dave.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.251
You don't like the name Greg.
You're Greg.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.787
Oh. Yeah, yeah, right. Uh...

06:59.887 --> 07:03.123
I like to be called Gregory.
Where's your badge?

07:03.223 --> 07:05.859
Okay.
Forget my badge, G-Money.

07:05.959 --> 07:09.062
I'm going to need a raise
to go along with that promotion.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.632
More work, more money,
my good man.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.269
No can do. We don't
have it in the budget.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.305
Hmm. Well,

07:18.405 --> 07:21.408
it has been nice working
with you. Good day, sir.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.279
What's Dave doing?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.315
Dave is walking away.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.017
Uh...

07:30.117 --> 07:32.185
Dave is walking away
from the job that Dave loves?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.521
Yes.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.523
Walking away is
your superpower.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.191
They've invested too much
time and money into you.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.393
Once they know you're
willing to walk,

07:40.528 --> 07:42.295
that's when you got
all the leverage.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.665
I don't know, Calvin.
Are you sure?

07:44.765 --> 07:46.099
Trust me.

07:46.199 --> 07:50.370
There's no way Gregory is
ever gonna let you walk.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.540
You see these oranges?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.174
Four dollars.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.610
The man wanted five.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.281
Well, if that's
the way you feel,

08:01.381 --> 08:04.017
I guess I have
no other choice but to...

08:04.117 --> 08:05.686
walk away.

08:09.557 --> 08:14.094
Just to be clear,
I am walking away...

08:14.194 --> 08:15.729
from this job.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.267
Actually, hang on.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.935
Yes? What's that?

08:23.571 --> 08:26.874
Do you want your last check
mailed to your home address?

08:26.974 --> 08:30.410
I'll have you know
that I have direct deposit.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.852
Still walking.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.023
Here I go.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.992
Out the door.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.128
Across... the threshold.

08:49.429 --> 08:52.132
Walking through
the hallway.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.167
Past reception.

08:55.035 --> 08:59.206
I'm now... now making it
towards the stairs.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.776
I begin my descent!

09:07.114 --> 09:09.049
Good afternoon,
brilliant educators!

09:09.149 --> 09:12.185
How are you liking the staff?
Aren't they great?

09:12.285 --> 09:13.654
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.222
I, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.758
Can it wait? I've got
to deal with a situation.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.627
Jaden brought
his mom's "microphone"

09:19.693 --> 09:20.928
to show-and-tell today.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.163
Turns out, it has
three different settings

09:23.263 --> 09:25.298
and is not a microphone.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.469
Oh! Wow.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.939
Oh. Okay.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.874
Sure, sure. I-It can wait.
Okay. See you later.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.277
Oh, Principal Johnson.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.647
Love, love,
love your dress.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.981
Oh, thank you.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.651
It's an oldie but a goodie.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.191
So, how's everybody
doing today?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.893
Oh, fine.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.563
Or, as Principal Barbie would
say, "I'm super-duper great."

09:58.198 --> 10:00.267
:
It's an oldie but a goodie.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.302
I'm so sunny and bright
in my peasant dresses

10:02.402 --> 10:05.605
and I have glitter
coming out of my butt.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.274
Well, howdy-doody!

10:07.374 --> 10:10.911
I know how to milk cows
because I'm from Wyoming.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.547
Michigan!

10:14.648 --> 10:16.516
She's from Michigan.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.718
Are you sure?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.519
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.054
Because she's my best friend,

10:21.154 --> 10:24.858
and she can rock
a peasant dress, thank you.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.828
Are you spying on us?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.797
Ain't nobody spying on you.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.732
But if you think
I'm going to stand here

10:31.832 --> 10:33.000
and let you talk
about my best friend,

10:33.100 --> 10:34.634
you got another think coming.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.938
And Tammy, I wouldn't be
talking about people

10:38.038 --> 10:40.240
with those eyelashes
looking like a spider

10:40.340 --> 10:42.142
took a dump on my eyelids.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.480
Mm...

10:47.580 --> 10:49.950
Mm-mm.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.651
Ah. Aha.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.221
:
Please don't.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.624
Do you want to sit here
and play your brother?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.727
I'm already
playing my brother.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.529
Yeah. Here we go.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.797
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.565
Yeah, yeah.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.200
Oh, hey, Dave.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.136
Hey.
Hey, how'd it go with Gregory?

11:09.236 --> 11:12.539
Well, I did exactly what
you told me to do. I walked.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.808
My man!

11:14.908 --> 11:16.744
I walked out the door,
down the hall,

11:16.844 --> 11:19.246
out to my car
and now I'm here.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.348
Without a job.

11:22.649 --> 11:23.951
Wait. What?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.385
Dave, you quit your job?

11:25.485 --> 11:28.188
Oh, no, no, no.
I thought I was negotiating.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.224
It wasn't until I got to my car
that I realized...

11:31.324 --> 11:32.793
I had quit.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.764
But the "walk" always works.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.233
Hey, Dave, man. Uh, I know how
you feel. Not that long ago,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.634
I had quit my job,

11:41.769 --> 11:43.470
but now I have my dream job.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.538
Yeah, look, I got my dream job.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.440
And now I've lost it.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.509
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell Gemma.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.878
Look, hold on, hold--

11:50.978 --> 11:53.346
No one's gonna say anything
to anybody.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.015
I'll think of something.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.785
All right. Well,
I'm gonna walk home.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.853
Because that's
what I do now.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.422
I walk.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.358
David...

12:07.327 --> 12:09.797
Oh, man, I got to fix this.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.531
I feel horrible.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.167
I really blew this
for Dave.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.536
Hey, Pop?

12:16.636 --> 12:19.339
I know this isn't
a good time, but, uh...

12:20.373 --> 12:21.809
Oh.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.610
...checkmate.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.682
You boys are not going
to believe this.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.084
Mom!

12:31.184 --> 12:33.386
You know, you could knock.
Why?

12:33.486 --> 12:36.389
We could have been
doing anything in here.

12:37.624 --> 12:38.859
Like what?

12:38.959 --> 12:39.960
And "we"?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.229
Will you two be quiet?

12:42.329 --> 12:43.363
Look, I need your help.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.432
Oh, no, Mama.
What did you do?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.600
Well, those teachers started
talking about Gemma again

12:47.700 --> 12:49.837
and I kind of went off on them.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.705
What level of "kind of"?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.174
I couldn't help it.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.443
And now Gemma sent me
a text. "See me."

12:56.543 --> 12:58.245
She's going to want me
to apologize.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.148
Well, Ma, kind of sounds
like an apology is in order.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.316
After what they said?
Whose side are you on?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.152
They were talking smack
about Gemma.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.719
You got to stick to your guns.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.156
Stick to my guns?
You sound crazy.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.690
You want me to lose my job?

13:10.858 --> 13:12.459
I love working with those kids.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.663
You know what? I don't know
why I come to y'all for help.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.072
When are we going to learn?

13:25.172 --> 13:26.874
Never get in the middle
of an argument

13:26.907 --> 13:28.641
between our mama
and our mama.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.014
Let me begin by saying
I'm sorry for not telling you

13:34.114 --> 13:36.149
that Mrs. Butler was
a personal friend.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.585
She objected to things
that were said about me.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.321
I get it, people need
to blow off steam.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.790
I don't know what was said,
and I don't need to know.

13:43.891 --> 13:47.094
Now, Mrs. Butler, would you
like to say something?

13:47.194 --> 13:49.096
Um, yeah, thanks.
Mm-hmm.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.532
Sorry.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.737
Could you elaborate?

13:59.907 --> 14:01.774
So sorry.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.747
Tina. If you can't be sincere,
what are we doing here?

14:07.915 --> 14:10.717
Sincerity would be nice.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.619
Oh, you want sincere?

14:12.719 --> 14:15.688
Oh, oh. Okay.
That's what we're doing? Okay.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.424
Well, in that case,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.726
I sincerely apologize

14:19.826 --> 14:21.929
for losing it when I heard
y'all talking trash

14:21.995 --> 14:23.430
about my best friend,

14:23.530 --> 14:26.266
saying that she had glitter
coming out of her ass.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.300
That's what you said?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.937
That's what, that's what it was.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.338
We accept your apology.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.506
He-he said
the glitter thing. Oh...

14:33.606 --> 14:36.843
And I apologize,

14:36.944 --> 14:38.445
from the bottom of my heart,

14:38.545 --> 14:39.812
for going off on y'all

14:39.947 --> 14:41.982
when y'all called her
"Principal Barbie"

14:42.082 --> 14:45.385
behind her back, like
little two-faced cowards.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.188
You know, Gemma, you're right.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.123
I like being sincere.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.628
Principal Barbie?

14:55.728 --> 14:56.629
I'm sorry.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.865
We didn't mean
anything by it.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.534
You know what? I embrace it.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.804
Barbie's been an astronaut,
a veterinarian,

15:04.972 --> 15:07.574
a Mountie, and lives
in a Malibu dream house.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.977
As far as I'm concerned,
she's a boss.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.113
Like me.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.781
Your boss.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.651
You have bus duty all next week.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.488
Tootles!

15:27.995 --> 15:30.197
Now that was a read.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.465
It was? Like a Tina read?
Mm-hmm.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.401
No, no. A Gemma read.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.469
But still, admit it:
you feel better.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.570
I guess I do.
See?

15:37.670 --> 15:40.273
But Tina, we
can't do this again.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.375
How about we agree, "What
happens in the teachers' lounge

15:42.475 --> 15:44.077
stays in the lounge"?

15:44.177 --> 15:45.412
Oh, that's fine.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.779
Because now that
I told them off,

15:46.879 --> 15:49.782
they're gonna keep
your name out of their mouths.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.754
You learned nothing,
but thank you.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.063
Well, hello, fellow coworkers.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.033
It's the taco bar
down at the cafeteria.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.135
Yummy.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.936
Has anybody seen Gregory?

16:10.037 --> 16:10.937
He's in his office.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.105
Oh, good.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.841
Other way.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.044
Oh, of course.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.911
Tacos on the brain, man.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.083
Wait...
How'd you get in here?

16:23.183 --> 16:24.351
Where's your badge?
Oh!

16:24.451 --> 16:26.486
Uh, uh, have it on
my person this time.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.121
That's David Johnson's.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.858
Uh, yeah, but the scanner
downstairs doesn't know that.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.194
Had all the
privileges of a white man.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.828
Got right on in.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.566
Phillip! Deactivate
David Johnson's badge.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.667
No, hold on.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.335
Look, hear me out first.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.870
But before you do that,

16:43.970 --> 16:47.274
why don't you enjoy this
nice mocha latte? It's on me.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.209
I'm lactose intolerant.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.914
Bit I bet you're not
allergic to $2 million.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.617
Is that a winning ticket?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.352
Who knows? I mean, could be.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.521
But you gotta be in it
to win it.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.791
Now, let me put this
on your person.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.995
What do you want?

17:09.796 --> 17:12.565
Look, I want you to give
my friend Dave his job back.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.101
Oh, I didn't fire David.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.503
He was the one who,
to use his own word, walked.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.371
Well, actually, you know,

17:18.471 --> 17:19.872
that was my word.

17:19.972 --> 17:24.844
Which, in my defense, is usually
a pretty good strategy.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.448
You ever try to buy fruit
from the side of the highway?

17:28.548 --> 17:29.816
I'm a diabetic.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.019
Uh...

17:33.120 --> 17:34.254
Listen,

17:34.354 --> 17:36.123
Dave didn't want to walk.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.290
He loves this job,

17:37.390 --> 17:38.691
and I know you'll never find

17:38.791 --> 17:39.959
a better man for it.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.162
I just gave him some bad...
See? See?

17:42.262 --> 17:45.265
Calvin, will you show him my ID?
It's fine, Maurice.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.899
Yeah, that's right,
it is fine, Maurice.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.801
And next time, don't be
so quick with the Taser.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.142
Malcolm told me
you were coming down here.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.577
But, Calvin, this is something
I need to do myself.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.546
Well, good luck
getting your job back.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.048
This guy's allergic
to everything.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.787
Hey, Gregory.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.622
Uh, look, my friend here...

18:09.722 --> 18:11.324
he means well.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.226
Gives me a hard time for being
too much of a people pleaser,

18:13.326 --> 18:15.795
which I know
some people find annoying.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.198
I'm "some people."

18:20.167 --> 18:22.735
Look, Gregory, I love this job.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.372
I care about vets
because I am a vet,

18:25.472 --> 18:26.606
which makes me more qualified

18:26.706 --> 18:29.642
than anyone else
in this department.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.478
I deserve this job

18:31.578 --> 18:34.447
and I think I deserve the raise

18:34.547 --> 18:36.716
that should have come with it.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.019
David, I would love

18:40.187 --> 18:41.488
to give you the raise,
but you know the government...

18:41.588 --> 18:43.290
I-I do,
I do know the government.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.926
And I also know that there is
wiggle room in any negotiation.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.895
I mean, that's why the taco bar

18:48.995 --> 18:52.365
now offers flour
and corn tortillas.

18:55.902 --> 18:59.806
That's true. A lifesaver
for the gluten-sensitive.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.111
I suppose
I could free up some money

19:05.212 --> 19:08.215
if I reclassify your position.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.418
Make you liaison to
the assistant division director

19:11.518 --> 19:14.821
instead of assistant to the
divisional director's liaison.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.892
Is that not the same thing?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.629
Not even close.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.231
I'll take that promotion.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.698
Thank you.
Well, hey, uh,

19:25.798 --> 19:28.235
Gregory? Since you're
in such a giving mood,

19:28.335 --> 19:32.004
how about giving my man here
a better parking spot?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.341
If you leave, I will do that.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.510
Then I am walking.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.346
What would you do
without me, man?

19:39.446 --> 19:40.513
Mic drop!
Mic-- No!

19:40.613 --> 19:42.649
Oh. Oh.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.384
Sorry.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.020
Aw, there's lactose everywhere.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.526
Ah, look at this.

19:54.427 --> 19:58.265
Thanks, man.
Picture of me and my bestie.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.832
Oh, yeah.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.502
Actually, I want Gregory

20:02.602 --> 20:04.771
to see this every time
he comes in here.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.640
That way he knows
if he messes with Dave,

20:07.740 --> 20:09.976
he messes with me.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.714
Oh, good.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.082
Your friend's back.

20:16.182 --> 20:19.051
With his pass on his person.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.020
I need those reports, David.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.491
Yeah.
You know, actually,
he prefers Dave.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.958
I prefer David.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.760
I respond to both.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.095
No, Dave.

20:29.195 --> 20:32.465
You do not have to please
anyone but yourself.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.733
You're right.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.537
Um, Gregory, I prefer Dave.

20:37.637 --> 20:38.671
Fine.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.707
Dave.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.241
Cal.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.677
What the hell
that man just call me?

20:44.777 --> 20:46.045
You heard me, C-Money!

20:46.145 --> 20:49.181
Oh, this is not
about to be a thing.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.919
I think he's warming up to you. Cal.
