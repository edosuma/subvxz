WEBVTT

00:00.016 --> 00:01.120
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:01.121 --> 00:03.140
His fingerprints were found
on the airplane?

00:03.141 --> 00:05.040
Inside the cargo hatch door.

00:05.050 --> 00:06.100
They were fresh
when the plane landed.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.080
There was a stowaway on 828.

00:08.090 --> 00:11.120
I want you to climb out onto
the landing gear and jump down.

00:11.130 --> 00:13.070
- And then what?
- And then you run.

00:13.090 --> 00:15.090
Olive is an amazing young woman.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.000
You've done an incredible job.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.180
It doesn't matter
where you found the strength.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.090
Save him.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.160
- Olive Stone?
- Yeah.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.140
I'm afraid we caught her shoplifting.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.040
- We need to go in.
- Are you crazy?

00:25.050 --> 00:26.120
You need to trust me, okay?

00:26.130 --> 00:28.040
But I thought
her dad was already here.

00:28.050 --> 00:29.070
There they are.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.159
Hi.
I'm Danny.

00:32.170 --> 00:35.020
NYPD!
Everybody down on the floor!

00:36.060 --> 00:37.120
Who made the call?

00:37.140 --> 00:39.050
I did.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.050
You don't have to take the fall
to protect me, Jared.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.010
That is the last thing that I want.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.090
Then tell me
what's really going on.

00:52.065 --> 00:53.965
- More water?
- No, thank you.

00:53.975 --> 00:57.005
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm fine.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.065
What about you, sir?

00:59.085 --> 01:01.005
Could I get a...

01:01.015 --> 01:02.965
I'll be right back.

01:06.045 --> 01:08.965
See anything interesting
down there, kiddo?

01:08.965 --> 01:10.895
No New York yet.

01:13.025 --> 01:16.975
This is the longest I've ever
been away from Cal.

01:16.985 --> 01:19.015
Well, Olive, being a twin

01:19.025 --> 01:21.945
is a heck of a special relationship.

01:21.955 --> 01:25.915
You always feel connected,
no matter where you are.

01:28.905 --> 01:31.015
- Did the trip work?
- I don't know what you're...

01:31.025 --> 01:35.065
Please. I can spot a marital
repair job a mile away.

01:35.075 --> 01:36.935
Oh.

01:36.945 --> 01:38.055
Ben and I are fine.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.995
I know my son.

01:40.015 --> 01:43.005
You two haven't been having
many good times lately.

01:46.895 --> 01:48.085
We're too focused on Cal.

01:49.935 --> 01:52.025
Getting away from the hospital helped.

01:52.035 --> 01:54.025
Maybe we're turning a corner.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.830 --> 02:05.860
I want to wait for Cal and Daddy.

02:05.870 --> 02:06.940
Oh, no, honey.

02:06.950 --> 02:09.800
Let's go home.
We'll get unpacked first.

02:09.820 --> 02:11.780
Honey, you know, I got all kinds
of baseball to catch up on.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.870
He's got his baseball.
I know you miss your brother,

02:13.880 --> 02:15.900
but he'll be here before you know it.

02:15.910 --> 02:18.810
Please, Grandma?

02:18.830 --> 02:20.890
I'm gonna show you something.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.780
All righty, Ollie Bollie.

02:25.790 --> 02:27.960
Flight 828... there.
You see?

02:27.980 --> 02:29.940
It's not gonna arrive
for another few hours.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.820
It's too long to wait.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.830
"See Agent"?
What's that mean?

02:36.890 --> 02:38.870
That's just airline talk, honey.

02:38.880 --> 02:39.960
For passengers on
Montego Air Flight 828,

02:39.970 --> 02:41.880
please see an agent.

02:41.890 --> 02:43.950
- I know it's gonna be bad news.
- Jared, stop.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.790
I should have never proposed
so soon after the accident.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.910
I mean, she's not ready.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.830
Now she's gonna get off that
plane and turn me down.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.880
No. She's gonna get off
that plane and say yes.

02:52.890 --> 02:54.870
- Are you sure?
- Please.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.790
We've been friends since forever.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.970
I'm so totally psychic.

02:58.750 --> 02:59.950
Michaela... am I right?

02:59.960 --> 03:02.800
No, it's Grace.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.800
Hello?

03:05.920 --> 03:07.880
W-What's wrong?

03:07.890 --> 03:09.880
Excuse me.
NYPD, coming through.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.930
Thank you.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.960
Not both of them.
They're... They're... They're gonna...

03:13.970 --> 03:15.950
- Dear God, not both my babies.
- They're gonna find them, Kar.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.840
What's going on?
Grace is over there, looking for answers.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.830
Maybe your badge will help.

03:20.850 --> 03:21.970
Our Father who art in heaven.

03:21.980 --> 03:23.880
Hallowed be thy name.

03:23.890 --> 03:25.810
Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done...

03:25.820 --> 03:27.840
There's a search operation in progress.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.960
Now, that's the official answer.
Tell us what's really going on.

03:29.970 --> 03:32.840
That's all the information
I have at this time.

03:32.850 --> 03:34.920
We're doing all we can.
But what are you doing?

03:34.930 --> 03:36.840
Who's looking for my family?

03:36.850 --> 03:37.960
Ma'am, y-you need to calm down.

03:37.970 --> 03:39.960
The hell I do!
My family's on that plane.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.840
Olive shouldn't be hearing this.
Hey, O!

03:42.850 --> 03:44.970
How was Jamaica?
Come tell Auntie...

03:44.980 --> 03:47.810
Oh, my God.
I should have said no.

03:47.820 --> 03:48.920
I should have made him
stay on our flight.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.920
We'd all be together now.
Cal would be here now.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.870
I thought you said
they were bumped.

03:52.890 --> 03:57.790
No, they volunteered for $400,
and now my son is missing.

03:57.810 --> 03:59.860
Oh, my God.
S-She didn't want to come back?

03:59.870 --> 04:01.830
I want my dad!

04:01.850 --> 04:03.850
I want my dad!
I know.

04:10.910 --> 04:12.890
This is a huge mess.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.910
You're in the U.S. illegally,
and Bethany broke... what...

04:14.930 --> 04:17.950
- Six federal laws smuggling you onto that plane?
- And proud of it.

04:17.970 --> 04:19.850
You think
I should have left him there

04:19.860 --> 04:21.850
to become a victim of
a hate crime in Jamaica?

04:21.860 --> 04:23.850
No, but now Vance is searching for him,

04:23.860 --> 04:25.810
and your choice has put us all in jeopardy.

04:25.820 --> 04:26.950
I am not going to jail and missing

04:26.970 --> 04:28.900
another five years with my family.

04:28.910 --> 04:30.920
I'm grateful for all your help,

04:30.940 --> 04:33.850
but I can't ask you
to endanger your families.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.810
I'll leave. No, no, it's too late.
The NSA will find evidence

04:36.820 --> 04:37.930
at the hospital linking us to your escape.

04:37.940 --> 04:38.970
Besides, I'm supposed to help you.

04:39.750 --> 04:40.980
- We all are.
- Not all of us.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.900
Just me. Like your brother said,
this was my choice.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.860
I've got a cabin upstate.
We can go... Vance will find you.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.980
It's a friend's cabin.
He can't trace it to me.

04:50.750 --> 04:51.980
Besides, the place is in
the middle of nowhere.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.860
I just need to grab
some supplies and the keys.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.840
That sounds great.
Good luck.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.870
Hey!

05:01.880 --> 05:03.830
You can't just blow them off.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.900
I know you believe
some mystical force

05:04.910 --> 05:05.980
is binding us to each other,

05:06.750 --> 05:07.860
but these callings are dangerous.

05:07.870 --> 05:08.910
- You don't know that.
- Really?

05:08.920 --> 05:09.930
Jared's career is on the line

05:10.940 --> 05:11.980
because you listened to
some voice in your head.

05:12.750 --> 05:13.760
I misunderstood the message.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.900
Or something is screwing with us.

05:14.910 --> 05:15.960
I don't believe that.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.940
And I will find a way to save Jared's job.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.760
Go ahead.
Sabotage your life,

05:20.780 --> 05:22.950
but don't ask me to blow up mine.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.960
It's all connected.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.870
You just heard something.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.870
Hey!
Tell me what it said.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.850
There's nothing some creepy voice can say

05:34.870 --> 05:36.890
that is worth risking my family's safety.

05:36.910 --> 05:38.910
I know two kidnapped girls
who would disagree.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.830
Don't blackmail me, Mick.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.960
Grace and the kids come first.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.910
I'm going home.
You can't just walk away from this.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.870
Watch me.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.170
Sitrep. Now.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.030
John Doe isn't on the manifest,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.020
but fingerprints in
the cargo hold are conclusive...

06:05.020 --> 06:06.220
He was on that plane.
And yet, those fingerprints

06:06.230 --> 06:08.230
have so far failed to identify him.

06:09.010 --> 06:11.020
We're reaching out to Interpol,
casting a wider net.

06:11.030 --> 06:14.030
Any intel on how he avoided
arrest at the hospital?

06:14.050 --> 06:17.130
- Nothing at this time...
- I want verified information now.

06:17.140 --> 06:19.030
Who is he? Where is he?

06:19.050 --> 06:22.050
Does he have accomplices?
If so, are they passengers?

06:22.060 --> 06:24.050
I shouldn't have to tell
anyone in this room

06:24.060 --> 06:25.150
finding John Doe is a matter

06:25.170 --> 06:26.210
of national security.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.140
He had help. From a passenger.

06:30.150 --> 06:32.130
Bethany Collins.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.050
The flight attendant was at the hospital.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.010
So was Saanvi Bahl.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.180
She works there,
could be a coincidence.

06:37.190 --> 06:40.010
Not when one of them has access
to the cargo hold.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.220
I want these women located,
interviewed. Now.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.200
Let me tell you something...
As union rep,

06:46.220 --> 06:49.060
it's my job to protect your job.

06:49.070 --> 06:51.140
CDIU is gonna make someone pay,
all right?

06:51.150 --> 06:55.160
Could be you, or we just let
this giant, stinking turd

06:55.180 --> 06:57.150
kind of roll downhill.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.170
You want me to blame
Detective Stone.

06:59.190 --> 07:01.220
T-That's not gonna happen.
She says she heard a gunshot.

07:01.230 --> 07:03.020
That's good enough for me.

07:03.030 --> 07:04.230
Look, you're being G.O. Sixteened.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.140
Do you understand?

07:06.150 --> 07:08.200
They catch you lying,
you get fired. Automatically.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.140
And ain't nothin'
the union can do

07:10.150 --> 07:13.180
except say "sayonara" and wave
goodbye to your sorry ass.

07:13.190 --> 07:15.190
Thanks for the advice.
All right.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.140
Don't say I didn't warn ya, huh?

07:22.040 --> 07:23.150
Hey.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.150
Hey, I thought Riojas benched you.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.170
I was worried about you.

07:27.190 --> 07:28.230
Is that your delegate?

07:30.030 --> 07:31.120
What'd he say?

07:31.130 --> 07:33.070
It's gonna be
a walk in the park.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.190
Go home.
Enjoy the day off.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.040
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.200
- How was your day?
- Good.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.030
Uh, Olive's at school already,

07:47.040 --> 07:49.000
so Cal will come with me to work.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.000
Well, how about I hang out with him?

07:51.010 --> 07:53.000
He'll start school soon,
so I want to max out

07:53.010 --> 07:54.120
all the free time we got left.

07:54.130 --> 07:55.230
I thought you were
doing résumé follow-up.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.150
Done and dusted.
It's just a waiting game now.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.130
Well, I'm sure you'll get
a lot of great offers.

08:00.150 --> 08:03.040
But today, it's all about Cal.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.160
Well, get going.
And have fun.

08:07.010 --> 08:08.050
Dad!

08:09.050 --> 08:11.210
"Fortnite" totally rocks.
You gotta learn to play.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.080
Well, then you gotta teach me...

08:13.090 --> 08:15.130
It's all connected.

08:16.210 --> 08:18.210
Um, Dad?

08:21.080 --> 08:23.190
Hey.

08:23.210 --> 08:27.160
Do you ever feel like someone
else is controlling your life?

08:27.170 --> 08:30.130
Only, like, all the time.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.049
You, Mom, Grandpa,
all of my doctors.

08:34.059 --> 08:37.039
And being
controlled is no fun, right?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.169
So what do you say we try
a little chaos theory?

08:39.179 --> 08:42.030
Be unpredictable.
Cool.

08:42.049 --> 08:44.169
How?
We don't make any decisions.

08:44.179 --> 08:47.010
We flip a coin,
and we leave it to chance.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.180
And nobody's in charge.

08:48.190 --> 08:49.220
Okay?

08:49.230 --> 08:53.020
So, heads we go bowling.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.020
Tails, Coney Island.

08:55.030 --> 08:56.170
- Sound good?
- Sounds great.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.090
All right.
Here we go.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.140
Coney Island! Sweet!

09:02.150 --> 09:04.170
I love the Cyclone!
All right, let's go!

09:04.180 --> 09:06.060
Masters of our own destiny.

09:06.070 --> 09:09.010
I like the sound of that.
Have a great day, guys.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.090
We'll see you later.

09:25.230 --> 09:29.060
At the six-month anniversary of
Flight 828's disappearance,

09:29.070 --> 09:32.200
the odds of finding any trace
of the doomed flight are slim.

09:32.220 --> 09:35.070
No evidence of the plane
has ever been recovered.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.230
And now the families of 828
face a sad reality...

09:39.000 --> 09:41.160
They may never recover
their loved ones' remains.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.190
And now, in other...

09:44.230 --> 09:48.020
I made you some soup, Mom.

09:48.030 --> 09:51.180
Oh, thanks, Ollie Bollie,
but I'm not really hungry.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.040
You gotta eat.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.200
What happened to your hand?

09:54.220 --> 09:56.230
I tried to make you
ham and cheese,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.030
but the knife slipped,
and I cut myself,

09:59.040 --> 10:00.160
and the blood got on the bread,

10:00.180 --> 10:03.020
and we don't have
any more bread or even ham,

10:03.030 --> 10:05.080
and the cheese has green spots on it.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.190
So I just made Cup O' Noodles.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.180
I hope you like it, Mom.

10:34.010 --> 10:36.070
Pull yourself together.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.230
Thanks for helping.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.230
I couldn't face being in
Mick's apartment alone.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.070
Yeah, of course.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.110
I can't believe her life
boils down to these boxes.

10:50.190 --> 10:54.010
Every single one is me
and Evie and Michaela.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.080
The Three Amigas.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.230
And only one left.

11:04.050 --> 11:06.050
Do you remember this one?

11:06.060 --> 11:08.180
The Summer Carnival at St. Agnes.

11:10.050 --> 11:12.170
Evie tripped over
Mrs. O'Connell's poodle

11:12.180 --> 11:15.000
and fell over.

11:15.010 --> 11:17.010
Ah. I wondered who was making
such a ruckus.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.010
Oh, don't stop on our account.

11:19.020 --> 11:22.050
It'd good to hear real laughter again.

11:22.060 --> 11:23.200
It feels wrong.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.040
Joy is never wrong.

11:29.050 --> 11:31.080
I miss them all so much,

11:31.090 --> 11:34.070
and I know we'll be together
again someday.

11:34.090 --> 11:36.210
But right now, I think to myself,

11:36.220 --> 11:38.100
what would Michaela want?

11:38.110 --> 11:40.090
And I know.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.200
She'd want the people she loved
the most to be happy.

11:46.020 --> 11:49.020
Here.
No, honey.

11:49.030 --> 11:51.020
You two keep them.

11:51.030 --> 11:53.210
Remember her and laugh.

11:53.220 --> 11:56.040
That way, she'll live forever.

11:59.060 --> 12:02.190
When Cal was sick...

12:02.210 --> 12:08.000
I wanted to make the most
of every moment.

12:08.020 --> 12:12.210
That's why we were on that
damn trip in the first place.

12:12.220 --> 12:15.230
Not only did I lose my son,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.050
but I lost my husband, too.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.210
I felt like I had no one left.

12:29.030 --> 12:32.100
But I did have someone left...

12:32.110 --> 12:34.020
My daughter.

12:35.150 --> 12:39.050
And she's what brought me here today.

12:39.070 --> 12:41.080
I mean, people say to me,

12:41.100 --> 12:44.030
"Grace, you look great.
You're so strong."

12:46.040 --> 12:49.000
But I know
they're just being polite.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.230
I don't know.
It's weird, but, sometimes,

12:51.000 --> 12:56.050
I just... I wish that someone
would just say to me,

12:56.070 --> 12:58.050
"Gee, Grace, you look like hell."

13:02.050 --> 13:04.120
Well, thanks for sharing, Grace.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.230
Gee, Grace.
You look like hell.

13:20.210 --> 13:22.110
Now, that's the first time
insulting a woman

13:22.120 --> 13:24.110
ever made her smile.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.210
Well, I-I guess I asked for it.

13:27.230 --> 13:30.070
Yeah.
Thank you.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.120
I hardly recognize the sound of
my own laugh.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.110
I'm Grace.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.000
Danny.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.080
And you're welcome.

13:45.620 --> 13:46.690
- Masters!
- Masters!

13:48.550 --> 13:49.580
What is cotton candy?

13:49.590 --> 13:51.500
You know what?

13:51.510 --> 13:52.720
That's a very good question.
I have no idea.

13:57.710 --> 13:59.540
I suck at this.

13:59.550 --> 14:00.640
Everybody does.
It's impossible.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.620
LeBron couldn't even sink a shot.

14:02.630 --> 14:04.500
Hey, come on.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.540
You wanna master
your own destiny?

14:05.550 --> 14:06.600
Come on.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.540
Way better.

14:08.550 --> 14:10.550
It always is during the day.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.500
Yeah!

14:13.560 --> 14:15.510
Hey!

14:15.520 --> 14:17.550
- That one!
- Here you go.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.640
That's a good one.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.560
All right, let's flip for lunch.

14:20.570 --> 14:22.610
Heads, Nathan's.
Tails, pizza.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.620
Pizza!
Pizza!

14:30.520 --> 14:32.700
We go on another ride, I'll yak.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.510
You and me both.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.590
Let's go home.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.510
It's all connected.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.510
But only if the coin says so.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.630
Yeah.
Go for it.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.710
Heads we hit the subway.
Tails we stay.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.500
Home.
F train's right over there.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.600
Shouldn't we just take a Lyft?

14:54.610 --> 14:55.710
Come on, dad.
Keep it random.

14:55.730 --> 14:57.570
Now let's go.
I hear the train.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.570
Surprise.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.720
Wow.
I'm so happy to see you.

15:08.730 --> 15:11.640
I was in the neighborhood, so...

15:11.650 --> 15:13.520
Yeah, come in.

15:13.530 --> 15:16.520
I'm sorry the place is a mess.

15:22.610 --> 15:24.500
You want a coffee?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.730
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.560
That looks like one of the ones
my mom would always crochet.

15:32.570 --> 15:34.520
Yeah, she made it for me.

15:36.530 --> 15:37.650
I'm an idiot.
You should have it.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.660
No, no, it's okay, really.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.610
It's sweet of you to offer.

15:41.620 --> 15:45.510
I'm a double idiot.

15:45.530 --> 15:47.610
My photos.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.570
When we cleaned out your place,
I kept them.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.520
I can't believe you saved them.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.610
Anything for you, Mick.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.530
I mean it.

15:58.530 --> 16:00.630
Actually, that's why I'm here.

16:00.650 --> 16:02.620
I need your help.

16:02.630 --> 16:05.610
Jared is taking the fall
for something that I did...

16:05.620 --> 16:08.730
Um, a mistake I made.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.570
He thinks he's doing the right thing,

16:10.580 --> 16:11.620
but it could mess up his whole career.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.680
You gotta...
You gotta tell him to stop.

16:15.530 --> 16:17.560
He didn't tell me.

16:22.630 --> 16:24.610
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.630
- This was a mistake.
- Don't go, please.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.730
It's not a mistake.

16:28.510 --> 16:30.540
You have a problem,
you come to me.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.670
The Three Amigas, remember?

16:32.680 --> 16:34.660
And there's still three of us.

16:34.670 --> 16:38.570
You, me, and... and Jared.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.660
All for one.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.620
So you'll convince him
not to take the fall?

16:42.630 --> 16:44.640
No, absolutely not.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.550
You know he always does
the right thing.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.660
Please, Lou.
Help me save his job.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.540
Being a detective...
That's his dream.

16:51.550 --> 16:52.630
I know.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.630
I am so sorry I missed
your promotion ceremony.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.670
Don't hate me.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.680
Never.

17:01.690 --> 17:03.670
Cheers.
Cheers.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.670
Let me see your bling.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.670
I still keep expecting them
to take it back,

17:10.680 --> 17:12.589
say it was all a mistake.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.520
Please.
You totally deserve this.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.609
You work your ass off.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.650
And you basically have no life.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.599
Excuse me, but I have a life.

17:21.609 --> 17:22.609
Ahh.
Yeah.

17:22.630 --> 17:23.680
I go to the gym.
Mm-hmm.

17:23.690 --> 17:26.550
I work on my car. I...
Yeah, boring.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.550
You need adventure.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.670
Surfing, sky diving, anything.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.540
Get out of your comfort zone.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.570
I don't know.
Coward.

17:51.690 --> 17:54.680
That was out of your comfort zone.

17:54.690 --> 17:58.520
Yeah, that was crazy.

17:58.530 --> 17:59.620
Sorry.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.680
Are you?

18:06.530 --> 18:08.660
Not at all.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.520
Me, either.

18:17.610 --> 18:20.560
Mom, I'm not hugging him.

18:20.570 --> 18:21.640
Okay, fine.

18:21.650 --> 18:24.550
Just please be polite.
Danny is my friend.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.570
He's not your friend.
He's your boyfriend.

18:26.580 --> 18:27.710
I'm 12, not an idiot.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.650
Guess you better answer that.

18:34.570 --> 18:36.600
Yep, guess I better.

18:43.530 --> 18:44.570
Olive sounds happy.

18:44.580 --> 18:45.690
Sorry.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.570
It's my fault.

18:47.580 --> 18:50.550
I think two years is still too soon.

18:50.570 --> 18:51.610
Stop.
It's not your fault.

18:51.620 --> 18:52.690
Or hers.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.570
Look, I'll go, okay?

18:54.580 --> 18:56.650
We'll try again another time.
No. Uh.

18:59.630 --> 19:03.650
It's taken me a long time
to be ready for this.

19:03.660 --> 19:06.580
But you've been good for me,

19:06.590 --> 19:09.560
and I think you would
be good for her, too,

19:09.580 --> 19:11.540
if she'd let you.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.630
So, stay.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.640
Please.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.620
I made meatloaf.

19:17.630 --> 19:18.700
Ahh.

19:18.710 --> 19:20.630
Now there's an offer
I can't refuse.

19:28.620 --> 19:31.560
So, who would like seconds?

19:31.580 --> 19:36.660
Mm, well, my trainer would
want me to say no, but, uh,

19:36.670 --> 19:40.540
I can't.

19:40.550 --> 19:41.620
Thanks.

19:47.590 --> 19:49.590
So, you don't like
your mom's cooking, huh?

19:51.560 --> 19:52.670
Want to know a secret?

19:53.680 --> 19:55.600
I don't like meatloaf, either.

19:55.610 --> 19:57.610
Then why'd you ask for seconds?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.550
I'm just being polite.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.670
It's kind of customary
when people like each other.

20:05.630 --> 20:07.630
Tough room.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.630
Come on, Olive.
Help me figure this out.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.710
If you hate meatloaf
and I hate meatloaf,

20:11.720 --> 20:13.680
then why is your mom
making meatloaf?

20:13.690 --> 20:16.670
She thinks it's my favorite,
but she's wrong.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.650
It's not.
It's...

20:19.670 --> 20:22.590
Cal's.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.730
Hmm.
Oh, sweetie.

20:25.510 --> 20:26.670
You must miss your brother so much.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.710
He's not dead.
He's just lost.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.680
And some day, when I grow up,
I'm gonna find him.

20:33.730 --> 20:35.720
Olive!
Come back here.

20:35.730 --> 20:38.720
It's all right.
Let her go.

20:38.730 --> 20:41.640
I'm sorry.

20:41.650 --> 20:43.650
Hey, more meatloaf for me.

20:48.690 --> 20:50.600
Mm.

20:50.690 --> 20:53.700
It's... It's really good.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.720
It's delicious.

20:55.730 --> 20:57.590
So good.

20:58.570 --> 20:59.720
It's all connected.

20:59.730 --> 21:01.660
Next stop...
Columbus Circle, 59th Street,

21:01.680 --> 21:03.700
7th Avenue stop.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.680
Hey, it's the guy from the airport.

21:05.690 --> 21:08.670
Hey, Mr. Flight 828.
What's up?

21:08.690 --> 21:10.690
- Hey, 828.
- Can we get a selfie?

21:10.700 --> 21:12.670
Come on, guys.
It's my kid here.

21:12.690 --> 21:14.730
Hey, hey! Cal, Cal!
Buddy.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.730
It's not our stop.
We're still in Manhattan.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.670
It's part of the game, Dad.
This way.

21:18.690 --> 21:20.690
Follow me.
Cal!

21:22.610 --> 21:24.690
No, Cal, stop!

21:24.700 --> 21:25.720
Cal!

21:26.500 --> 21:27.630
Cal, wait up!

21:27.650 --> 21:29.590
Take the first left.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.700
Oh!

21:31.710 --> 21:33.660
No, Cal, slow down!

21:35.610 --> 21:36.700
Cal, stop!

21:36.710 --> 21:39.510
Come on, Dad!
Masters of our own destiny!

21:45.620 --> 21:46.710
Game over, Cal!
We're going home!

21:46.730 --> 21:48.630
No way!
This is too much fun!

21:48.650 --> 21:50.610
Cal, stop!

21:50.620 --> 21:52.710
Don't worry, Dad.
It's all connected!

21:55.590 --> 21:56.640
Cal!

21:56.660 --> 21:59.720
Tell me I'm doing the right thing.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.730
You're doing the right thing.

22:04.630 --> 22:06.700
Do what you gotta do and hurry back.
Yeah.

22:08.670 --> 22:10.660
And take the E-ZPass out of the car.

22:10.670 --> 22:12.720
Pay cash for everything.
Don't leave a paper trail.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.620
Easy, babe.
I'll be safe.

22:15.630 --> 22:17.610
See you Monday.
Okay.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.580
Bethany Collins, you're under arrest.

22:24.590 --> 22:26.500
- What's happening?
- What? What happened?

22:26.510 --> 22:27.700
No, wait, I'm sorry... what is going on?
What is this about?

22:28.700 --> 22:30.510
Cal!

22:31.660 --> 22:33.620
Cal, I said stop!

22:37.600 --> 22:39.510
No!
No, no, no, no, no!

22:39.520 --> 22:40.630
Don't open that!

22:40.640 --> 22:41.710
Cal!

22:44.640 --> 22:46.630
Cal!

22:46.640 --> 22:48.530
Cal, wait!

22:49.600 --> 22:51.590
Cal!

22:59.600 --> 23:00.710
Uh.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.540
Hi. I'm Cal.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.710
You're Thomas?

23:17.020 --> 23:18.780
How did you know his name?

23:18.790 --> 23:19.900
I-I didn't.

23:19.910 --> 23:22.810
It just came to me.

23:22.820 --> 23:25.780
Cal, you... you led us here.

23:25.790 --> 23:27.870
How did you find out about this place?

23:27.890 --> 23:29.810
I don't even know
what this place is.

23:29.820 --> 23:30.890
I was just being random.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.810
But you said, "It's all connected."

23:33.820 --> 23:34.980
Because it is.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.900
All the tunnels in the subway,
they come together.

23:37.910 --> 23:41.810
Okay, okay, but did you hear
something in... in your head?

23:41.820 --> 23:42.920
Like a voice?

23:42.940 --> 23:44.900
A voice?
What are you talking about?

23:44.910 --> 23:46.930
Cal, you must have known
this place was down here.

23:46.940 --> 23:49.780
Hey, easy on the boy, now.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.820
You play chess?

23:53.830 --> 23:55.900
A little.
Not too good.

23:55.910 --> 23:58.880
Well, practice, and you'll get better.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.900
Set it up.
We can play.

24:02.750 --> 24:05.760
Thank you.
I-I didn't mean to snap at him.

24:05.780 --> 24:06.930
I'm just...
Blown away?

24:06.950 --> 24:10.820
Yeah, that's...
That's an understatement.

24:13.790 --> 24:14.970
Let's talk.

24:20.780 --> 24:21.960
One minute we're on the subway.

24:21.980 --> 24:25.760
The next minute, I'm chasing
Cal, no sense of direction.

24:25.780 --> 24:26.980
But somehow, he brought us here.

24:28.910 --> 24:31.790
Look. I know you don't want
to be involved...

24:31.800 --> 24:33.910
No, that...

24:33.920 --> 24:35.920
That was before.

24:35.930 --> 24:39.890
Everything's changed now.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.880
I thought you were leaving with Bethany.

24:41.890 --> 24:45.770
So did I, but Bethany leave
and never come back.

24:45.790 --> 24:46.920
It's been hours.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.790
Oh, aren't you supposed to be at work?

24:50.800 --> 24:52.790
Day off.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.790
I thought we could eat some pizza

24:54.800 --> 24:56.750
and catch up like old times.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.790
Come on.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.950
I'm sick of sitting out here alone.

25:06.760 --> 25:07.810
Oh.

25:07.830 --> 25:08.950
What's up, honey?

25:08.960 --> 25:10.950
Hmm?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.920
I miss Mom, Dad.

25:12.930 --> 25:15.770
Yeah.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.890
Yeah. Me, too.

25:18.900 --> 25:22.920
Most nights, I sit out here
just to feel close to her.

25:25.930 --> 25:28.800
Well, I appreciate the pepperoni,

25:28.810 --> 25:30.780
but what's on your mind, kiddo?

25:30.800 --> 25:31.950
Hmm?

25:37.810 --> 25:39.930
Today, I saw one of Mom's afghans.

25:39.940 --> 25:43.820
Oh, she was always making
those damn things.

25:43.840 --> 25:44.970
I mean, I couldn't sit down
without getting

25:44.980 --> 25:48.890
a crochet hook in my ass.

25:48.900 --> 25:49.970
Mm.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.980
It was at
Jared and Lourdes' house.

25:55.970 --> 25:58.970
Being there was like...

25:58.980 --> 26:00.900
Looking at the life
that would have been mine.

26:00.910 --> 26:02.900
Ah. You're young.

26:02.910 --> 26:04.980
You can still have
all that and more.

26:05.750 --> 26:06.940
Just not with Jared.

26:06.950 --> 26:09.850
In Jamaica, you weren't sure
you wanted it.

26:09.860 --> 26:13.820
I know, but on the plane,

26:13.830 --> 26:16.760
I made the decision
I was gonna say yes.

26:18.770 --> 26:19.940
You still want to be with him?

26:19.950 --> 26:21.970
Of course I do, Dad.
How could I not?

26:21.980 --> 26:24.910
Then go get him, sweetie.
He's married.

26:24.930 --> 26:27.810
Only because he thought
you were gone.

26:27.820 --> 26:28.940
I told your mom.

26:28.950 --> 26:31.780
I-I didn't think
he ever stopped loving you.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.910
So what would
she tell me to do, then?

26:34.930 --> 26:37.780
She'd want you to be happy.

26:37.790 --> 26:40.810
I mean, if you love him, tell him.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.750
That is crazy advice, Dad.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.940
I mean, if I'd been on your plane

26:46.950 --> 26:50.770
and come home and found your
mother with some other man?

26:51.750 --> 26:53.820
I'd have fought like hell
to get her back.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.820
Hmm?

26:58.790 --> 27:00.750
We're doing Christmas in July?

27:00.760 --> 27:02.780
Carpe diem.
Yeah.

27:02.790 --> 27:03.950
Go on, open it.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.980
Ohh. Aah.

27:07.870 --> 27:10.920
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

27:10.940 --> 27:12.860
He's too polite to say so,

27:12.870 --> 27:15.760
but no single guy needs an afghan.

27:15.780 --> 27:17.810
He won't be single much longer.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.760
Jared and Lourdes.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.830
I didn't want to say anything.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.830
Love is never something
to feel guilty about.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.750
It's a blessing.

27:35.810 --> 27:36.860
Thank you.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.840
- This means so much.
- Oh.

27:48.810 --> 27:50.870
You don't think
it's a good idea.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.850
He still loves our girl.

27:53.870 --> 27:55.810
I'm gonna be with her soon.

27:55.830 --> 27:57.950
I'm want to tell her he's okay.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.770
All good things, Steve.

28:12.970 --> 28:14.810
Who is this man?

28:14.820 --> 28:16.770
I have no idea.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.840
I find that hard to believe
given his fingerprints

28:18.850 --> 28:20.980
were all over your cargo hold,
and you had unrestricted access.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.840
I don't know anything about that.

28:22.850 --> 28:24.960
Also, hard to believe
seeing as he disappeared

28:24.970 --> 28:29.800
from the hospital at the exact
same time you were there.

28:30.890 --> 28:33.800
Think carefully, Ms. Collins.

28:33.810 --> 28:34.970
An unidentified man
with uncontrolled access

28:34.980 --> 28:36.980
to that aircraft

28:37.760 --> 28:39.860
might be responsible for
what happened to Flight 828.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.760
Are you sure you want to protect him?

28:41.770 --> 28:44.780
What I want is a lawyer.
Good idea.

28:44.790 --> 28:47.980
They'll explain
you're facing hefty jail time.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.760
I have nothing more to say.
Then just listen

28:50.780 --> 28:53.780
before you throw away
a one-time opportunity.

28:53.790 --> 28:54.940
Tell us what you know.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.850
Help us apprehend this fugitive.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.760
I'll cut you a deal.
You can go home to your wife.

29:01.860 --> 29:02.980
I heard a gunshot.

29:03.750 --> 29:04.850
Thought our undercover
was in jeopardy,

29:04.860 --> 29:06.970
so I made the call to go in.

29:06.980 --> 29:09.810
The undercover said
no shots were fired

29:09.820 --> 29:11.890
until after you burst in.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.850
You blew his entire operation.

29:13.860 --> 29:16.780
It was chaotic.
There was a lot going on.

29:16.790 --> 29:18.810
He could have easily
just mixed up his timeline.

29:18.820 --> 29:20.840
Or maybe you were confused.

29:22.770 --> 29:23.850
I'm confident in my testimony.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.880
Your career's on the line here, Vasquez.

29:25.900 --> 29:29.780
We're trying to help out,
so one last time...

29:30.790 --> 29:32.830
would you like to change
anything in your statement?

29:32.840 --> 29:34.810
I stand by everything I've said.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.850
Very well, Detective.

29:40.750 --> 29:41.830
Sit tight.

29:53.840 --> 29:54.980
Danny.

30:00.820 --> 30:03.780
You can't be here.
You don't give me any option.

30:03.790 --> 30:07.750
You ignore my texts,
then say you're busy at work.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.770
I called.
They said you took the day off.

30:09.790 --> 30:11.850
Danny, I told you... I'm trying
to rebuild my marriage.

30:11.870 --> 30:14.800
This isn't about you and me, Grace.

30:14.810 --> 30:15.980
This is about Olive.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.880
10 days ago,
I practically lived here.

30:26.890 --> 30:29.790
We were a family.
Danny, please, don't.

30:29.800 --> 30:30.910
Just... Just listen.

30:30.920 --> 30:33.770
When I got to Bluemercury,

30:33.790 --> 30:37.760
Olive said store security told her
to call her dad.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.790
She dialed me.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.900
She felt guilty that she'd
reached out to me and not Ben.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.760
I...

30:44.790 --> 30:48.920
I know I'm not her real dad...

30:48.930 --> 30:51.880
but for three years,
I was all she had.

30:52.890 --> 30:56.840
When I lost Nina, I thought
I'd... I'd be alone forever.

30:58.850 --> 31:01.760
And then I found you.

31:01.770 --> 31:05.890
So I know I'll survive losing you...

31:07.810 --> 31:09.760
but I'm not sure I know
how to get over

31:09.770 --> 31:11.910
losing that amazing kid.

31:15.770 --> 31:18.750
It sounds like she feels
the same way about you.

31:39.940 --> 31:43.920
Detective Vasquez...

31:45.910 --> 31:47.850
You're stripped of 10 days' pay.

31:53.810 --> 31:54.890
That's it?

31:58.790 --> 31:59.900
Have a nice day, fellas.

32:04.850 --> 32:06.890
I knew someone must
have saved my ass.

32:08.780 --> 32:09.860
What do you want?

32:09.870 --> 32:12.790
You're more valuable to me
inside that precinct

32:12.800 --> 32:14.770
than off the job forever.

32:15.870 --> 32:17.820
You want information about Michaela.

32:17.830 --> 32:19.880
I knew you were a smart man.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.840
You'll tell me what she does,

32:21.860 --> 32:24.810
where she goes,
who she talks to... all of it.

32:25.790 --> 32:26.900
Or?

32:40.870 --> 32:42.780
If you needed
a double to get over it,

32:42.790 --> 32:45.860
I'm guessing the hearing
didn't go that well.

32:45.870 --> 32:48.800
I only got docked 10 days' pay.

32:48.820 --> 32:50.780
That's it?

32:59.960 --> 33:02.810
Jared.

33:02.830 --> 33:04.830
You standing up for me
meant a lot.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.910
It made me realize that I want...
Look, if you don't mind,

33:06.920 --> 33:08.950
I'm kind of done thinking
about the hearing.

33:13.890 --> 33:15.880
I should go.

33:15.890 --> 33:16.950
Yeah, of course.

33:28.950 --> 33:32.930
I don't know how far it'll take
you, but that's all I got.

33:32.950 --> 33:34.890
Thanks.

33:34.900 --> 33:36.920
If you hadn't come back...

33:36.930 --> 33:38.800
Dad.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.830
We need to go.
All right, in a minute, buddy.

33:41.850 --> 33:42.870
I better get him home.

33:43.890 --> 33:44.930
Wait until after midnight
once the crowds thin out.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.840
That'll... That'll be safest.

33:47.850 --> 33:49.810
Let's go now, Dad!
Cal...

33:49.820 --> 33:51.870
It's all connected.
Dad, come on.

33:52.970 --> 33:54.940
Come on, Dad!
Let's go!

33:54.960 --> 33:56.880
Cal, wait.
What is it?

33:56.890 --> 33:58.800
Why do we have to go?

33:59.850 --> 34:00.900
Someone's coming.

34:08.290 --> 34:09.270
Go! It's me they want.

34:09.530 --> 34:11.630
Get your son to safety.
Good luck. All right, buddy.

34:11.639 --> 34:12.530
Time to go.

34:12.540 --> 34:13.679
Wait. Wait.

34:16.690 --> 34:18.600
I think she's a friend.

34:19.610 --> 34:20.679
He brought you this far.

34:22.540 --> 34:23.650
Wait! Wait!

34:28.570 --> 34:32.530
Hello? Hello?
Anyone there?

34:32.540 --> 34:33.610
Who is it?

34:33.620 --> 34:35.699
Georgia, Bethany's wife.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.639
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:40.650 --> 34:42.639
Oh, thank God I found you.

34:42.650 --> 34:44.600
Bethany was arrested
on her way back here.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.520
Arrested?
By whom?

34:46.530 --> 34:48.520
Some guy Vance from the NSA.

34:48.530 --> 34:49.639
Are you positive
you weren't followed?

34:49.650 --> 34:51.639
I took the service exit
out of our building.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.730
Drove around in circles.
We need to get on the road.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.540
I don't want to cause no more trouble.
It's no trouble.

34:56.550 --> 34:58.550
I know the plan, and I know
that Beth would want me

34:58.570 --> 34:59.690
to make sure you were safe.

35:04.710 --> 35:07.580
Keep practicing your end game,
little man.

35:07.590 --> 35:08.730
Bye, Thomas.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.650
How did you know she was a friend?

35:16.660 --> 35:18.730
I don't know.
Just a feeling.

35:20.690 --> 35:22.540
I'm really tired.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.630
Can we go home?

35:23.650 --> 35:26.570
Yeah, buddy.
Let's go home.

35:26.580 --> 35:29.540
Your mom's probably wondering
where we are.

35:38.590 --> 35:39.660
Hey.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.610
Hi.

35:41.630 --> 35:43.550
Mwah.

35:45.580 --> 35:46.580
What's wrong?

35:46.590 --> 35:47.720
Mnh.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.580
Michaela stopped by earlier.

35:51.590 --> 35:53.710
She said you're in trouble at work.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.720
It was just a minor flare-up.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.710
Everything's under control.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.550
She shouldn't have worried you.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.680
What worried me is hearing
about it from Michaela

36:03.700 --> 36:05.630
instead of you.

36:07.580 --> 36:09.630
You risked your job to protect her?

36:09.640 --> 36:11.590
My job was never in danger.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.570
You've never hidden anything
from me before.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.650
Are you mad that
I protected her?

36:18.670 --> 36:21.610
She's my best friend,
our best friend.

36:21.630 --> 36:25.710
And, look... I love that
you stick up for her.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.640
But tell me
that's the only reason.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.670
I feel bad for Michaela.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.680
Everything's been a mess for her

36:35.690 --> 36:37.680
since the day that plane landed.

36:40.510 --> 36:42.600
And that's it?

36:46.680 --> 36:48.560
That's it.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.510
Hey, babe.

36:56.590 --> 36:57.660
You know what today is?

37:00.690 --> 37:03.690
Don't tell me you forgot our
three-year first kiss-aversary.

37:10.530 --> 37:13.600
Jared, what's wrong?

37:13.610 --> 37:15.510
It's back.

37:16.650 --> 37:18.610
What is?

37:19.720 --> 37:22.600
The plane.

37:22.610 --> 37:24.570
Michaela's back.

37:26.650 --> 37:28.630
And now more
on our continuing coverage

37:28.650 --> 37:31.520
of the miracle of Flight 828,

37:31.530 --> 37:33.720
landing 5 1/2 years after it went missing.

37:33.730 --> 37:35.720
The 191 passengers

37:35.730 --> 37:39.650
will return to a world
that gave them up for dead.

37:39.660 --> 37:43.590
Among these recipients of
a miraculous second chance

37:43.610 --> 37:46.610
is eminent scholar and
professor Dr. Fiona Clarke.

37:51.700 --> 37:54.610
Um, I'm gonna go.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.730
Y-Yeah.

38:27.630 --> 38:29.500
Hey, Mom.

38:29.510 --> 38:30.620
Hey, love.

38:30.630 --> 38:32.620
Are you okay?

38:32.630 --> 38:34.620
Yeah.

38:38.510 --> 38:40.520
That's what I should have asked you.

38:40.540 --> 38:44.710
When you kept on me about
telling your dad about Danny.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.680
I thought it was because
you were mad at me

38:46.700 --> 38:48.670
for not making a clean break.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.540
That wasn't it, was it?

38:52.550 --> 38:54.710
I love Dad.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.620
And I'm so glad that he's back.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.620
But Danny's my dad, too.

39:02.710 --> 39:05.530
I know...

39:05.550 --> 39:06.680
and that's okay.

40:04.650 --> 40:07.530
How's Jared?

40:07.540 --> 40:09.710
Problem solved.
I told you I'd take care of it.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.520
Wow.

40:13.530 --> 40:16.610
Yeah.
My head's spinning.

40:16.620 --> 40:19.690
I just needed to see it all clearly.

40:21.730 --> 40:24.520
This is a lot of work for
a guy who said this morning

40:24.530 --> 40:26.530
he wanted nothing to do with the plane,

40:26.540 --> 40:28.630
the passengers, the callings.

40:28.650 --> 40:30.500
I tried to break away.

40:32.690 --> 40:34.650
But Cal brought me back.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.530
Is he having callings?

40:37.540 --> 40:38.700
He says he's not hearing voices,

40:38.710 --> 40:42.690
but he knows things
he shouldn't,

40:42.700 --> 40:44.710
senses things before they happen.

40:46.690 --> 40:49.550
It's not like with us.

40:49.570 --> 40:52.730
He's... He's different.

40:55.660 --> 40:57.730
I can't walk away now.

41:00.550 --> 41:03.530
It's like a giant spider web.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.710
And we're all trapped in it.

41:30.710 --> 41:33.520
It's all connected.
