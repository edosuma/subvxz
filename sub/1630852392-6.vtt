WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.800
Corporate headquarters in Europe -
it's got to be big. It's perfect.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.360
Want to push paper now?Stop a
bomber, another takes his place.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.520
Find the money, and you
topple the whole regime.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.280
There's dozens of companies
and hundreds of policies here.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.840
Culain sounds Irish. Look.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.760
It's the entrance
to Fionn Brannigan's house.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.680
Tomorrow might be too late
to prevent more deaths.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.560
Can we have a minute
to grapple with this one?

00:22.560 --> 00:24.080
Bibi, all you need to do right now

00:24.080 --> 00:26.640
is to give me a good reason
not to give this to CAB.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.000
Every detail of your
and Fionn's entire system.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.200
According to her alpha pass,

00:31.200 --> 00:33.160
Bibi Melnick was
in the port the night

00:33.160 --> 00:35.480
before the Brussels bomb
as well as the Antwerp one.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.600
It's her.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.560
Oh, my God! She's the one
bringing the bombers in.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.040
Come on.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.080
You're being followed,
Mevrouw Melnick. By police.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.840
Get rid of them.
That's what you're paid for.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.480
Get out of the car!
Raise your hands!

00:52.480 --> 00:54.440
Where is he?

01:05.280 --> 01:07.040
CROWD CHANTING:

01:08.120 --> 01:09.880
VIKTOR MAES:

01:18.920 --> 01:20.480
CROWD CHEERING

01:20.480 --> 01:23.720
Any news on the black SUV
that got in my way?

01:23.720 --> 01:25.600
Nothing. No trace.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.280
But CCTV shows this is the route

01:28.280 --> 01:31.520
Bibi Melnick took the night
that Sana disappeared.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.680
She leaves work late,
then drives through the dock area,

01:35.680 --> 01:37.920
through security point, before...

01:39.120 --> 01:41.320
..turning into Boosestraat.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.200
Which is a black spot.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.560
There are no street cameras.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.880
After 15 minutes, she reappears.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.760
And then drives straight home.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.320
That must be where the handover was.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.240
Yeah, probably.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.760
What's on this Boosestraat?

01:54.760 --> 01:56.440
Not much. Very quiet.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.560
This may be why she chose it.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.000
I've sent some uniforms down there.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.560
To knock on doors,
see what they can find.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.400
OK. Good.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.360
We need to put pressure on her
if we want to find this bomber.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.600
SIREN WAILS

02:51.880 --> 02:53.680
Diver found this at the spot

02:53.680 --> 02:55.320
where a port worker
saw Mevrouw Melnick

02:55.320 --> 02:56.680
throw something in the water.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.280
So...

02:59.280 --> 03:02.600
Whatever is on that hard disk
must be pretty incriminating.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.320
Let's hope so.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.760
What damage will
the water have done?

03:06.760 --> 03:09.640
It may have affected
the electronics,

03:09.640 --> 03:11.480
but that's about it.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.920
The data should be still on it,
whether it got wet or not.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.280
OK, the platter's fine.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.960
This is all that's on it.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.600
These are all company
financial accounts.

04:04.920 --> 04:08.800
We're already onto Culain
but send all those to Norah.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.520
See if there's anything
new in there. Sure.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.960
What's in VTL?

04:19.480 --> 04:21.520
Is that it? Is that all there is?

04:21.520 --> 04:23.080
Yeah, that's all.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.120
Oh, well, that's all
there is on this disk?

04:25.120 --> 04:26.960
Nothing that could be linked
to the attacks?

04:26.960 --> 04:28.600
No, this is it.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.720
What the fuck?

04:31.720 --> 04:33.640
What does VTL mean?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.040
Virtual tape library.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.040
It's data, storage technology

04:37.040 --> 04:39.640
for backing up data and information.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.800
If she went through the trouble
of trying to destroy this hard disk,

04:42.800 --> 04:44.560
these numbers must mean something.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.920
So stay on it. See if you
can find out what they mean.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.120
Wait here.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.680
SIREN BURST

05:56.240 --> 05:58.200
Police! Turn around!OK. OK.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.640
Turn around!OK.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.560
Get down! Get down!OK. OK.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.520
What is this about?
Can you tell me?

06:04.520 --> 06:07.160
Shut up! You're under arrest.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.920
They're questioning Koshinen,

06:32.920 --> 06:35.600
the captain of the tanker
who brought in the bombers.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.560
First impressions are he knows
nothing about any of this.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.440
What about her husband?
On his way here now.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.760
She still insisting
she doesn't want a lawyer?

06:45.760 --> 06:47.960
I think she hopes
she can handle this herself.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.560
Without anyone else finding out.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.600
Let's go put her straight.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.120
Follow me.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.280
Sit down.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.120
Isn't this all a little excessive?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.120
I must inform you this interview
is being recorded

07:25.120 --> 07:27.120
and remind you

07:27.120 --> 07:29.880
you have been arrested
on suspicions of crimes

07:29.880 --> 07:33.280
contravening the 2003
Law on Terrorist Offences.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.560
Anything you say may be used
as evidence in court.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.040
Will this take long?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.560
My husband will be expecting me.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.280
He has been arrested too
as part of our investigation.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.320
James has noth...

07:46.840 --> 07:48.400
He has never broken the law.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.440
Ever.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.320
Do you still wish

07:52.320 --> 07:54.560
to be interviewed
without a lawyer present?

07:55.680 --> 07:57.160
Sit down, please.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.480
You already know
Detective Sergeant Berry.

08:03.480 --> 08:07.160
She's here representing
the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.080
One minute, please.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.840
If this is something to do

08:23.840 --> 08:26.040
with what Fionn has been up to...
It's not.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.160
You're the one
we're interested in.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.560
Thanks, Mila.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.400
Recommencing the interview
with Mevrouw Melnick.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.560
At 21:46.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.960
We are investigating
the terrorist attacks

08:50.960 --> 08:52.840
in Brussels and here in Antwerp

08:52.840 --> 08:55.160
and I'm offering you the chance
to tell us what you know.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.240
I don't know anything.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.160
We believe this next attack
is very imminent.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.520
You can help us stop it.

09:03.520 --> 09:07.320
So I'm asking you to help us
save many citizens' lives.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.800
I would help if I could.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.360
You searched my car,
you found nothing.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.240
I don't know why you think
I'm involved.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.560
OK, fine.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.920
I have some photographs
I'd like you to take a look at.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.880
Do you recognise this vehicle?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.040
Of course, it's mine.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.960
Does anybody else drive this car?

09:38.960 --> 09:41.320
No, just me.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.640
Can you identify the person
driving in this image?

09:48.720 --> 09:51.680
Yes. It's me.

09:51.680 --> 09:55.800
Can you identify the person
in this image?

10:02.640 --> 10:04.080
It's me.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.240
We have identified the man
getting out of your car

10:18.240 --> 10:19.720
as Luis Spinola.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.400
The man who carried out
the Antwerp bombing.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.680
Can you identify the two
other men in this photo?

10:29.280 --> 10:31.360
If it helps jog your memory,

10:31.360 --> 10:34.800
these images were taken
the night before the bombing.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.320
We believe you used your
company's access to the port

10:38.320 --> 10:40.040
to bring these men
into the country

10:40.040 --> 10:42.160
so they could carry out
terrorist attacks.

10:43.880 --> 10:47.040
You must understand
you're facing terrorist charges

10:47.040 --> 10:48.960
and life in prison.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.600
Silence will not help you,
Mevrouw Melnick.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.520
You're right.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.200
There is another attack.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.520
It's scheduled
for tomorrow morning.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.920
I can help you prevent it
but I want to see James first.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.880
Like I already told you,
Mr Melnick is currently

11:13.880 --> 11:15.760
under arrest as part
of our investigation.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.080
And, like I told you,
he has nothing to do with this.

11:19.080 --> 11:23.160
If you want to stop this attack,
then go get him for me.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.160
Come! Come on!

11:32.160 --> 11:34.600
We're going. We have to leave.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.480
Chief Inspector, I don't
know what I'm doing here.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.400
And I don't know what's happening.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.800
But I do know my rights.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.160
We have conclusive evidence
that your wife helped the man

12:05.160 --> 12:07.600
who carried out last week's bombing.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.000
No, that's...

12:11.400 --> 12:12.840
You made a mistake.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.680
There's absolutely no mistake.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.640
KNOCKING, DOOR BUZZES

12:24.560 --> 12:26.880
Whatever you have to say to him,
make it quick.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.440
I'm so sorry.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.320
About all of this.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.160
All of what?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.440
What have you done?

12:43.440 --> 12:46.000
It's OK, they can't record us
in here.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.520
Bibi...

12:50.400 --> 12:51.880
You can tell me.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.840
The police have...

12:55.960 --> 12:57.640
..photos of me with...

12:58.680 --> 13:00.760
..with the man
who carried out the bombing.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.040
When you say "with him",
what do you mean?

13:06.040 --> 13:08.440
Getting out
of the boot of my car.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.160
They threatened to kill me
if I didn't do it.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.920
And Arthur too. And you.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.440
Who?

13:24.560 --> 13:28.160
This is all about your father's
fucking money, isn't it?

13:29.800 --> 13:33.360
The money that I told you from
the very beginning not to take.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.080
It was Daddy's money.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.880
He earned it. No-one else.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.480
And they hounded him
into his grave.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.720
I had every right to keep it.
It belongs to us.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.080
And Fionn?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.320
Getting thrown out of a plane.
How does that fit in?

14:02.320 --> 14:05.120
We underestimated the people
we were dealing with.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.960
Yeah. I'd say.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.000
I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.720
That's too late. Too late.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.760
I did it for us.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.240
Will you stop lying to me?

14:17.240 --> 14:19.520
We have more money
than we can ever spend.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.640
All of this has never been
about anything except you.

14:23.640 --> 14:27.320
You and your father.
And your father's fucking legacy.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.560
I need your help.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.040
If not for me,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.640
then to protect Arthur.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.520
I'm going to send you
a copy of this too.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.960
And we'll split the load.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.400
MESSAGE SENT AND RECEIVED ALERTS

14:51.400 --> 14:54.640
Got it.I take the first half,
you take the second.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.680
Thank you.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.240
This isn't just Culain stuff.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.600
What else is there?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.680
I don't know exactly.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.720
It looks like accounts
for a company registered

15:11.720 --> 15:13.600
in Angola?

15:20.200 --> 15:21.240
There's a list of...

15:27.280 --> 15:29.120
PHONE RINGS

15:32.800 --> 15:34.560
Hey!

15:34.560 --> 15:36.160
I heard you got new evidence.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.320
We have CCTV footage

15:38.320 --> 15:42.040
of Bibi Melnick handing over
Luis Spinola to two men.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.040
Jesus!Yeah.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.600
You should have seen her snooty face
when she saw the evidence.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.040
You reckon those two lads are
the ones that shot Darren Reid?

15:49.040 --> 15:50.360
You'd have to think.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.040
How are you getting on?

15:52.040 --> 15:55.320
Ah, it's all data this
and gigabytes that.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.400
So you're making the coffees
and trying to look busy?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.480
No. No, I have stuff to do.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.320
Emer, they're ready for us.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.040
I have to go, Sean.
I'll talk to you later.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.760
Before this interview
officially resumes,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.000
we would like to discuss
the possibility

16:11.000 --> 16:12.920
of a Regret Settlement.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.440
Go on.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.800
My wife is willing to admit

16:18.800 --> 16:20.960
that she did assist the attackers,

16:20.960 --> 16:23.560
transporting them from the port.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.440
But that she did so
only after threats were made

16:26.440 --> 16:29.560
against her life
and the lives of her family.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.040
And given that we believe that
the men who threatened her

16:32.040 --> 16:33.920
subsequently killed her brother,

16:33.920 --> 16:36.640
it was prudent to take
those threats seriously.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.880
Who are these people
who threatened her?

16:38.880 --> 16:41.000
After the death of her father,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.840
my wife and her brother entered
into an illegal agreement

16:43.840 --> 16:46.640
with some associates
to hide and launder

16:46.640 --> 16:49.320
a large quantity of
her father's overseas assets.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.680
Her brother never revealed
the identities of these associates,

16:53.680 --> 16:56.960
but my wife suspects that they
have links with organised crime.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.400
Bullshit!

17:00.520 --> 17:03.360
Article 326
of the Belgium Criminal Code

17:03.360 --> 17:06.000
provides a mechanism by
which a sentence can be excluded

17:06.000 --> 17:08.320
in the case of a guilty party
who confesses to everything

17:08.320 --> 17:10.320
at the planning stage of an attack.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.520
My wife is prepared

17:14.520 --> 17:17.360
to plead guilty to money
laundering charges

17:17.360 --> 17:21.800
and to help you prevent
an imminent terrorist attack.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.480
In return for immunity
from all other charges.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.280
Are you fucking joking?

17:26.280 --> 17:27.320
Emer.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.920
I think you're overestimating
your bargaining position.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.520
We have enough evidence
to bring charges as it is.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.200
There's a general election tomorrow.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.040
Imagine how it'll play in the media

17:40.040 --> 17:43.080
if you turn down a chance to
stop an attack on election day.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.160
To reiterate,

17:48.160 --> 17:49.800
my wife's help is dependent

17:49.800 --> 17:51.520
on an official Regret Settlement

17:51.520 --> 17:54.160
stating that she will face
no criminal charges

17:54.160 --> 17:55.720
beyond money laundering.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.960
That will need
to be approved by OCAD.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.400
And signed off by a Magistrate.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.680
We'll need you to identify

18:03.680 --> 18:05.800
the men you handed Spinola to.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.240
All I know is they were
employed by the criminals

18:09.240 --> 18:11.800
that my brother engaged
to launder our father's assets.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.880
Those men are accused
of carrying out

18:13.880 --> 18:15.520
at least three murders

18:15.520 --> 18:17.560
including Sana Retz
and your brother Fionn.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.160
That's all I know.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.400
Why are they organising
a bombing campaign

18:23.400 --> 18:26.920
made to look like it was carried out
by Muslim fundamentalists?

18:26.920 --> 18:31.080
I told you, my brother
dealt with them. Not me.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.960
Our evidence suggests
that Sana was killed by them

18:33.960 --> 18:36.040
because she saw you
leaving the warehouse

18:36.040 --> 18:37.560
with Spinola in your car.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.880
Who tipped them off about that?

18:40.880 --> 18:44.000
Did you tell them about Sana? No.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.640
Did you warn them about
the danger Fionn posed too?

18:47.640 --> 18:49.320
Of course not.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.760
He came here to tell you

18:51.760 --> 18:54.080
he was handing himself in.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.400
Which put you in
a very tricky situation.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.000
And then he's murdered.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.520
How did the killers even know
he was in that hangar?

19:01.520 --> 19:03.400
Did you tell them that?

19:03.400 --> 19:04.680
Did you?

19:14.040 --> 19:15.840
The attack is
in less than 12 hours.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.200
You're wasting your time.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.560
She is lying.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.360
Do you really think
that Fionn Brannigan

19:43.360 --> 19:46.000
is the brains behind all this
and she's some innocent victim?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.960
Probably not.Then why are you
thinking of giving her a free pass?

19:48.960 --> 19:51.360
To save people's lives and stop
another terrorist attack.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.560
What about the people killed
in the previous attacks?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.240
Don't they deserve justice?

19:55.240 --> 19:57.280
What about Sana?
And Fionn Brannigan?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.880
And Darren Reid?

19:58.880 --> 20:02.320
Hey, I agree, OK? Yeah?
It's not fair.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.880
But if there's a chance
of stopping this attack,

20:04.880 --> 20:06.680
I have to act on it.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.160
We could issue a terror alert,
warn the public instead.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.680
What if that only spooks Rivera?

20:10.680 --> 20:13.160
He detonates the bomb
somewhere else.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.240
What you and I feel doesn't matter.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.320
People much higher up
this food chain

20:17.320 --> 20:18.760
will decide what happens.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.280
James...

20:45.040 --> 20:47.960
If you knew the whole story,
you'd see this differently.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.000
OK.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.840
Tell me the whole story.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.440
Come on.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.640
Lay it on me.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.920
Because I would love to see
this differently right now.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.280
I think I would give
everything I have

21:07.280 --> 21:09.640
to see you differently right now.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.640
I can't.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.440
It would put you
and Arthur in danger.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.080
Don't you dare use Arthur
to get your way.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.080
PHONE RINGS

22:06.320 --> 22:07.480
Yeah?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.400
We found something
off the hard drive.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.680
Go on.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.040
We found a company called
TUXZ Ltd, registered in Angola,

22:14.040 --> 22:16.320
that was set up to trade
rough diamonds.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.160
Now, from what I can work out,

22:18.160 --> 22:20.600
Fionn and Bibi were receiving
illegal payments

22:20.600 --> 22:22.600
for their father's assets
they signed away.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.880
These payments were being filtered

22:24.880 --> 22:27.760
through a series of shell companies.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.560
All controlled by Culain.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.360
And then Culain pays millions
to this TUXZ Ltd

22:32.360 --> 22:35.440
for "unspecified services".

22:35.440 --> 22:37.880
How many millions?

22:37.880 --> 22:40.560
TUXZ Ltd is holding assets
worth over 40 million in diamonds.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
INHALES SHARPLY

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
Wow!

22:44.600 --> 22:46.360
How much were the father's
assets worth

22:46.360 --> 22:48.040
before they signed them over?

22:48.040 --> 22:50.960
Depending on who you ask,
around 600 million.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.640
Yeah, but they wouldn't be getting

22:52.640 --> 22:56.040
anywhere near market value
for them now, would they?

22:56.040 --> 22:59.800
No, with an arrangement like this,
they may have to accept as little
as 40 cents in every euro.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.560
Still, that's almost

23:01.560 --> 23:03.800
250 million?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.360
Where's the rest of it?

23:05.360 --> 23:07.720
We're looking.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.800
Well, keep looking.
I'll call you back.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.640
This Regret Settlement will
depend on you handing over

23:23.640 --> 23:25.920
the money that you received
from the illegal sale

23:25.920 --> 23:27.560
of your father's assets.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.880
Money that was stolen
from the Irish State.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.720
You have no jurisdiction here.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.680
You cannot be here
without Christian.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.280
You can't talk to Mevrouw Melnick.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.400
Wait! That's OK.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.000
This is a private matter.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.520
We're happy to talk to her.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.600
If you don't agree to return
the money that was stolen,

24:01.600 --> 24:04.840
I will ask the Irish Government
to make a formal objection

24:04.840 --> 24:07.200
to this Regret Settlement.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.160
Agreed.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.080
The money will be returned.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.920
I want a list of where
the money is, bank accounts.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.680
How much is there?

24:20.920 --> 24:22.880
Around 40 million in diamonds.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.960
That's even less than 10%
of the value of the assets.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.200
That's what Fionn negotiated.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.320
Regardless of what else happens,

24:33.320 --> 24:36.520
I'll be taking possession
of those diamonds tomorrow.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.480
She just gave up the 40 million
without a fight.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.400
Now, she wouldn't have done that

24:49.400 --> 24:51.760
unless she has lots more
hidden away.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.280
We need to find it.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.000
We're working on it.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.280
We need to find it soon
while we have her in custody.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.000
Because, if she gets a chance,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.920
she's going to start burying that
even deeper.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.240
No pressure, then.OK.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.600
Bye.Bye.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.080
Hey! Let's go to my office.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
Do you know what really bugs me?

26:13.800 --> 26:15.840
Lot of things, I imagine.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.000
All the "whys".

26:20.000 --> 26:22.040
Why make it look like
Muslim fundamentalists?

26:22.040 --> 26:24.160
Why now and here?

26:24.160 --> 26:26.000
Why use Columbians?

26:27.160 --> 26:29.440
I mean, she gives us this bomber,
nothing else,

26:29.440 --> 26:32.240
and she walks away
and we are none the wiser.

26:32.240 --> 26:35.200
We're saving lives.Are we, though?

26:35.200 --> 26:38.000
Or is letting her and the people
behind this get away

26:38.000 --> 26:40.680
going to cost us even more?

26:40.680 --> 26:42.600
PHONE RINGS

26:52.320 --> 26:53.880
It's in order.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.960
Where is this attack happening?

27:04.960 --> 27:08.000
Viktor Maes is holding
an election day press conference

27:08.000 --> 27:10.680
at the Museum aan de Stroom
tomorrow morning.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.240
They want to assassinate
Viktor Maes? No.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.800
The attack will target

27:15.800 --> 27:17.720
his supporters planning
to gather outside.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.000
You know what time exactly?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.640
No. How is he getting there?

27:23.640 --> 27:25.000
I wasn't told that.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.680
This is a photo we have of Rivera.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.880
Does he look like this?

27:34.880 --> 27:37.240
He's a little older.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.680
Greyer.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.920
OK.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.840
You will remain here in custody

27:43.840 --> 27:47.400
until the bomber has been
apprehended. What about me?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.400
Am I free to go?

27:49.400 --> 27:52.200
My son is at home.
I would like to be with him.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.760
Come with me.
I'll arrange your release.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.160
But we may need
to question you again.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.440
Of course. Thank you.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.240
I haven't got long, Norah.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.720
When I was going back through

28:11.720 --> 28:13.200
all the Culain and TUXZ accounts,

28:13.200 --> 28:14.760
I noticed that they'd both
been set up

28:14.760 --> 28:16.680
at the same time 15 months ago.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.280
And? Well, it's odd.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.040
The father died ten years ago.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.880
That's when they signed away
all his assets.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.480
But they're only setting up
these laundering companies now?

28:24.480 --> 28:28.120
Why do I sense that you already
know the answer to this?

28:28.120 --> 28:30.240
Not the entire answer,
but maybe part of it.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.760
Go on.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.720
These five VTL numbers
made me think.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.200
What if they had done this
four times before?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.560
Set up a system
like Culain and TUXZ,

28:38.560 --> 28:40.840
used it to launder the money

28:40.840 --> 28:42.800
they were receiving
for their father's assets.

28:42.800 --> 28:46.160
Then, after a period of about
two years, shut it down,

28:46.160 --> 28:47.440
set up another one.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.760
Yeah, so if they ever get caught,
it would only be

28:49.760 --> 28:52.120
the most recent scheme
and not the whole thing.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.320
Exactly. It's very simple.
Very clever.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.760
So where's the rest of the money?

28:56.760 --> 28:58.640
That bit, I don't know.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.400
But if we can trace
the storage devices

29:01.400 --> 29:03.200
these VTL numbers are linked to,

29:03.200 --> 29:05.440
I'm sure we'll find the answers.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.520
Good job. And...
OK, boss, we're ready.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.080
Oh! I have to go now.
Talk to you soon.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.640
OK, listen up, everybody!

29:23.120 --> 29:25.880
We travel to the MAS museum
in ones and twos.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.880
No large groups or marked cars.

29:27.880 --> 29:31.560
Everyone remains in plain clothes,
weapons concealed.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.600
We don't want to alert this bomber

29:33.600 --> 29:36.000
or give him any reason
to detonate this bomb early.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.960
At all times, be discreet.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.800
And know that Rivera
may well be in disguise

29:40.800 --> 29:42.800
or have changed his appearance.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.400
So keep a keen watch
on any men who are alone.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.640
Viktor Maes' office
has been informed?

29:48.640 --> 29:50.480
We haven't given details,

29:50.480 --> 29:52.640
but we told him that we are
concerned for his safety.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.280
And requested
that he doesn't attend

29:54.280 --> 29:55.920
the Museum press conference.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.080
His team knows to be discreet
with this information?

29:58.080 --> 30:01.800
Yeah, absolutely.
Everyone, go. Be safe.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.800
OK. Well...

30:12.320 --> 30:13.800
See you later.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.680
Hey, I want to be there too.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.280
At the MAS.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.000
Can't have an unarmed officer
present.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.960
Well, then, arm me.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.760
This has been a joint
investigative unit

30:22.760 --> 30:24.200
between your team and mine.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.800
You can't just cut me out now.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.840
Come.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.800
Hey. Give me some money.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.640
Sign there.

31:41.880 --> 31:44.240
I take it you know how...
Yep. I know how.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.920
You ready?

31:46.920 --> 31:49.200
Yeah, I was thinking
the area outside

31:49.200 --> 31:51.160
is big enough that
we could isolate Rivera.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.960
Why would we do that?

31:52.960 --> 31:56.400
To negotiate a surrender.
Not go straight to lethal force.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.160
He's wearing an IED with
who knows what kind of explosives.

31:59.160 --> 32:03.120
Rivera is not a fanatic. He's
not doing it for God or culture.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.760
We can talk him out of this.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.680
You don't know his motives.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.880
I know that he's a Catholic
Columbian, not a jihadist.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.360
Can't take that risk.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.640
If we kill him,
there's nothing that can lead us

32:13.640 --> 32:16.040
to the people behind these attacks.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.760
We don't know who they are
or why they're doing it.

32:18.760 --> 32:22.280
Luca Rivera alive
can help us catch them.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.280
My orders are to stop this attack

32:24.280 --> 32:26.520
and neutralise
the threat Rivera presents.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.640
Don't you want to find out
who's really behind this?

32:28.640 --> 32:31.600
I want to save lives and keep
my job. That's enough for today.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.320
Yeah.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.200
Um, can we sit here?

33:10.760 --> 33:11.800
No, no, no.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.200
No, it's not necessary.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.720
Thank you. Thank you?

33:20.720 --> 33:22.200
Thank you.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.040
We should probably split up,
cover more ground.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.440
RADIO: Possible target
on the Bonapartdock.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.640
Male, grey puffer jacket. OK.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.640
I'll go and check that. Why
don't you stay here?Hmm, hmm.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.440
OK. Negative.
Bonapartdock is not the target.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.600
Copy that. Target still at large.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.120
Are you going to the MAS?

34:31.920 --> 34:33.560
Because we are going there too.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.040
We can... We can walk with you.
No. No.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.840
No, it's OK, we can go together.

35:28.120 --> 35:31.400
RADIO: No further sightings
of suspicious lone males.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.320
Police! Put your hands in the air!

36:07.320 --> 36:09.000
PEOPLE SCREAM

36:13.280 --> 36:15.320
Hands in the air!

36:15.320 --> 36:17.280
Luca.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.960
Luca. Luca.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.760
Manos arriba! Manos arriba!

36:27.280 --> 36:29.960
Put the detonator down
or we will shoot.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.000
Luca.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.280
EMER SPEAKING SPANISH

36:32.280 --> 36:34.000
No. No.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.280
OK. Emer, stand down.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.400
He doesn't want to do it.
We can talk him out of it.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.400
Luca... Luca.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.120
No. No.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.160
Luca...

37:15.440 --> 37:16.480
Luca.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.000
Luca...

37:26.000 --> 37:27.040
Luca!

37:34.720 --> 37:36.440
Si. OK, OK, OK.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.520
Luca?

37:43.400 --> 37:44.440
Luca!

37:59.480 --> 38:01.400
KEYPAD BEEPS

38:05.240 --> 38:06.440
RINGING AT OTHER END

38:06.440 --> 38:07.920
Alo...

38:06.440 --> 38:07.920
GUNSHOT

38:34.520 --> 38:36.400
I had to do it, Emer.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.840
I have a responsibility
for the safety

38:39.840 --> 38:41.520
of the officers under my command.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.880
He didn't pose a threat.
He had a bomb.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.880
He wanted to talk to his wife.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.200
You don't know
what his intentions were.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.520
We have nothing now. We failed.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.720
How many people would have
been killed today

38:55.720 --> 38:57.320
if we didn't do what we did?

38:57.320 --> 38:59.840
That's not failure.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.840
What about the people
behind all this?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.960
Get away scot free.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.840
We have nothing on those two men

39:05.840 --> 39:09.040
who probably killed Sana,
Darren Reid and Fionn Brannigan.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.160
We have their images.
We will find them.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.280
PHONE RINGS

39:17.840 --> 39:19.200
It's Mila.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.720
Where are we with those VTLs?

39:23.720 --> 39:25.680
Nowhere.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.000
We haven't been able to work out
what those numbers mean.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.520
Have you spoken
to Norah and Josh about them?

39:30.520 --> 39:34.120
Yes. They are working on it too
but no luck.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.840
OK, thanks.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.120
Looks like Bibi Melnick
will get away scot free too.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.200
Minus the 40 million in diamonds

39:45.200 --> 39:46.880
she'll be handing over to you.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.760
Do you have a cigarette?

40:00.080 --> 40:01.600
You can keep them.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.280
Now that Rivera's dead,

40:09.280 --> 40:11.840
Emer really wants us
to crack this thing.

40:11.840 --> 40:15.240
Maybe those codes are serial
numbers for the VTLs.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.480
You...you know
what a VTL is, right?

40:17.480 --> 40:20.120
Yeah, it's a Virtual Tape Library.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.440
Used to store data and back it up.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.360
The clue's in the name. "Virtual".

40:24.360 --> 40:25.520
They aren't actual tapes.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.680
They're virtual storage
and backup facilities.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.360
Created by software packages.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.280
OK, so maybe they're serial numbers

40:31.280 --> 40:33.080
for the software packages.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.240
I'm pretty sure software companies

40:35.240 --> 40:38.120
haven't used four-digit
serial numbers since the 1980s.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.280
Do you mind, lads? This is
an office, not a short cut, yeah?

40:41.280 --> 40:42.520
I'm sorry.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.400
So how do we trace these numbers?

40:44.400 --> 40:46.160
I don't know. There are dozens,

40:46.160 --> 40:49.000
maybe hundreds of companies
providing VTL services.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Each could have thousands
of customers with multiple accounts.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.560
Without understanding
what these numbers are or mean,

40:55.560 --> 40:57.760
there's absolutely
no way of tracing them.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.880
He should have been here by now.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.920
Relax.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.400
If Aubrey said he'll be here,
he will be here.

41:19.920 --> 41:20.960
Told you.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.200
You're late.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.640
They killed Rivera before
he could detonate the bomb.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.400
When?

41:40.400 --> 41:42.120
About an hour ago. At the museum.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.920
It's a fuck up.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.640
Fuck!

42:11.400 --> 42:13.800
What about the documentation?

42:13.800 --> 42:15.920
The valuation papers
are in the envelope.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.360
I'm seizing these on behalf
of the Belgian Government,

42:25.360 --> 42:26.960
as they are in this jurisdiction.

42:26.960 --> 42:30.400
But I request you
hold them for us until we
have arranged their transport

42:30.400 --> 42:32.040
and handover
to the Irish Authorities.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.440
Of course.

42:34.760 --> 42:35.800
Thank you!

42:47.000 --> 42:48.440
It's a typo.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.160
What?

42:51.160 --> 42:52.720
VTL. It's a typo.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.240
It should be VLT for vault.

42:57.320 --> 43:00.520
0685 was her safety box number.

43:00.520 --> 43:03.880
It's also one of the VTL numbers.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.240
What are the other ones?

43:07.280 --> 43:09.080
It's, uh...

43:09.080 --> 43:11.800
..3099, 4987,

43:11.800 --> 43:14.720
6103, 7348.

43:14.720 --> 43:17.080
Have you any safety boxes
matching those numbers?

43:17.080 --> 43:18.560
Yes.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.680
Check if they're owned
by Mevrouw Melnick

43:20.680 --> 43:22.720
or members of her family
and, if they are,

43:22.720 --> 43:24.120
I need to see inside them now.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.160
OK.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.360
James?

43:52.360 --> 43:54.040
TELEVISION PLAYING

43:54.040 --> 43:56.520
TV: They were the battlefields
upon which this election

43:56.520 --> 43:59.080
would be fought and won or lost,
but it's clear now

43:59.080 --> 44:02.240
that the terrorist attacks
in Brussels and Antwerp...

44:03.760 --> 44:05.160
Arthur?

44:07.400 --> 44:08.840
James?

44:10.240 --> 44:12.680
TV: Long before
these recent attacks,

44:12.680 --> 44:15.440
the National Reform Party had
adopted a hardline stance

44:15.440 --> 44:17.960
on both immigration
and national purity,

44:17.960 --> 44:20.880
and many believe they will be
the beneficiaries

44:20.880 --> 44:23.280
of this political sea change.

44:23.280 --> 44:26.080
Joanne, you've been monitoring
the exit polls...

44:26.080 --> 44:28.720
James, call me when you get this.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.960
I just want to speak to Arthur.

44:32.960 --> 44:35.600
He's my son. I'm entitled to him.

44:35.600 --> 44:38.440
..recent terrorist attacks?
Absolutely.

44:38.440 --> 44:40.360
Please.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.360
Only today, an attempted
attack on Maes himself

44:42.360 --> 44:44.320
was foiled by police
at the Museum aan de Stroom.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.480
These atrocities have
strengthened Maes' hand

44:46.480 --> 44:47.880
as his party are for tightening

44:47.880 --> 44:50.760
immigration controls
and closing our borders,

44:50.760 --> 44:53.120
which presumably would put Belgium

44:53.120 --> 44:55.160
on a collision course with the EU.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.360
Maes' vision is of Belgium
leaving the EU and lowering

44:57.360 --> 44:59.400
its corporate tax rates
to make it a haven

44:59.400 --> 45:01.680
for business
and foreign investments.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.040
I've even been hearing rumours
from party insiders

45:04.040 --> 45:07.320
that Maes intends to sell
Antwerp Port to a consortium

45:07.320 --> 45:10.360
of private business interests
and hedge funds

45:10.360 --> 45:13.520
and use the money
to fund his policies.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.680
Slainte. Slainte!

45:18.680 --> 45:21.280
Sean. Have a look at this.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.120
Fuck!

45:28.120 --> 45:29.600
Yeah, fuck!

45:29.600 --> 45:32.840
All in diamonds?Yeah. Not bad.

45:47.440 --> 45:51.520
So... Are you the one coming
back to collect the diamonds?

45:53.200 --> 45:55.280
I don't suppose
they'll be trusting me.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.040
There might be a lot of paperwork

45:59.040 --> 46:01.920
that requires your presence, no?

46:01.920 --> 46:03.720
I doubt that.

46:03.720 --> 46:06.240
Revenue will be taking care
of all that from now.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.960
Maybe you'll have another reason
to come back for.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.240
And then I can take
you out for dinner.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.440
Yeah.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.480
Maybe.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.760
Thanks for everything.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.160
Did your wife pick this suit
out for you?

47:01.160 --> 47:03.040
Yes, she did. Of course.
Do you know why I know?

47:03.040 --> 47:06.840
Because you don't look like a used
car salesman or a politician.

47:06.840 --> 47:09.640
INDISTINCT

47:12.760 --> 47:14.160
I'll be right back. Yeah, yeah.

47:16.680 --> 47:19.880
Bibi, you shouldn't be here.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.080
Well, I tried calling.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.600
I need to speak to James.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.360
Do you know where he and Arthur are?

47:27.360 --> 47:29.000
Yes.
They're on their way to Vancouver

47:29.000 --> 47:30.560
to stay with James' mother.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.640
I need to see them.
So can you arrange it?

47:33.640 --> 47:35.400
Can you speak to James?

47:35.400 --> 47:38.440
James doesn't want you
anywhere near him or Arthur.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.200
And I have to agree.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.400
I think it's wise you put
space between you and them.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.680
And you and I.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.000
I did everything you asked.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.800
Everything.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.760
I even gave up Fionn.

47:53.040 --> 47:56.080
And I still haven't said a word
about any of it to anyone.

47:56.080 --> 47:57.720
Including James.

47:57.720 --> 47:59.920
Yes, and your discretion
was greatly appreciated.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.440
You said you'd protect me.

48:02.440 --> 48:05.040
And I did. And I still am.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.000
That's why you're still here.

48:08.240 --> 48:10.080
Just be patient.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.640
You should have come to me
for that fucking apartment.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.880
Not Fionn.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.200
Yeah, well, what's done is done.

48:20.200 --> 48:23.520
I'm going to lose my family,
my business.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.240
They've already taken my assets.

48:25.240 --> 48:27.640
I'm going to be charged
with money laundering.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.720
Keep your voice down.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.480
You're going to be fine. Trust me.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.400
A bit early to celebrate, isn't it?

48:41.360 --> 48:44.720
Exit polls rarely lie.
You know that.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.960
I see Maes is going
to privatise the Port.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.920
Is that what this was all about?

48:50.560 --> 48:53.480
You know, I really think
you should be leaving.

48:53.480 --> 48:56.800
You help him get elected

48:56.800 --> 48:59.480
and he sells Antwerp Port
to your company.

49:01.400 --> 49:03.280
Goodbye, Bibi.

49:15.080 --> 49:17.280
Mr Melnick would
like you to leave now.

49:34.960 --> 49:37.000
Hey. Hey.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.160
Welcome home, boss!
Welcome home, boss!

49:39.160 --> 49:41.040
Did you see Gately on the news?No.

49:41.040 --> 49:44.080
She was announcing our diamond haul
and, boy, did she look happy.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.840
Did she mention us?
She wasn't that happy.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.360
What are you having?
Oh, I'm driving, so...

49:49.360 --> 49:52.040
Get her a large whisky.
No-one is driving tonight.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.400
We're on it. OK.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.000
You helped stop that attack

49:56.000 --> 49:57.640
and we got 200 million
in state coffers.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.200
You should be pleased.

49:59.200 --> 50:01.640
I am. Well, you might
want to tell your face that.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.160
We got no-one, Norah.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.160
No-one important.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.880
No real idea who carried out
that bombing or why.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.400
And I'll be shocked if Bibi Melnick

50:10.400 --> 50:12.440
serves a day in prison.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.680
Let's just enjoy our win tonight.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.680
And, tomorrow,
we'll pick our next target.

50:18.440 --> 50:20.600
Here. There you go.Thank you!

50:21.720 --> 50:23.320
What are you two smiling about?

50:23.320 --> 50:25.240
A job well done by a great team.

50:26.360 --> 50:29.440
Slainte! Slainte!Well done!

50:29.440 --> 50:31.680
Another great job. Yow! Woohoo!

50:34.560 --> 50:35.680
Your round.
