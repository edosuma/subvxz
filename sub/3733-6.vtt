00:03.570 --> 00:06.459
- How do you know
Hannibal is in Florence?

00:06.500 --> 00:08.468
- Botticelli.
- You're drawing them

00:08.500 --> 00:11.663
to you, aren't you?
- I'm not searching
for Hannibal.

00:11.710 --> 00:15.237
I know exactly where he is.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.407
- I will pay 3 million dollars

00:17.450 --> 00:20.669
for the doctor alive.
- I'm Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.382
- Dr. Lecter is careful.
He will strike.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.116
- You are going to be caught.
It has already been

00:26.160 --> 00:28.116
set into motion.
- Ah!

00:31.530 --> 00:33.691
- Ugh!

00:36.600 --> 00:39.160
***

02:13.730 --> 02:16.164
***

02:22.870 --> 02:26.328
- (man): Jack.

02:35.450 --> 02:37.748
- He's wounded...

02:39.790 --> 02:42.588
...and he's worried.

02:42.630 --> 02:46.293
- No, Hannibal doesn't worry.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.798
Knowing he's in danger
won't rattle him any more

02:48.830 --> 02:50.866
than killing does.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.289
- If Rinaldo Pazzi had
decided to do his job

02:53.340 --> 02:55.296
as an officer of the law,

02:55.340 --> 02:57.308
he would have determined
very quickly that he was

02:57.340 --> 02:59.308
Hannibal Lecter. Would have
taken less than 30 minutes

02:59.340 --> 03:01.274
to get a warrant.
- All those resources

03:01.310 --> 03:04.700
were denied to Pazzi.

03:04.750 --> 03:07.275
As soon as he decided
to sell Hannibal,

03:07.320 --> 03:09.288
he became a bounty hunter.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.414
- Outside the law and alone.

03:12.460 --> 03:16.556
_ Here we are:
outSIde the law and alone.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.818
- Have you told la polizia

03:21.860 --> 03:25.523
they're looking
for Hannibal Lecter?

03:25.570 --> 03:29.461
- They're motivated to find
Dr. Fell inside the law.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.331
Knowing who he is,
what he's worth,

03:32.380 --> 03:34.371
it will just coax them
out of bounds.

03:34.410 --> 03:37.470
- That'd be a free-for-all.
- And Hannibal will slip away.

03:37.510 --> 03:41.674
Will you slip away with him?

03:44.550 --> 03:47.553
_ - Part of me
Will always want to.

03:47.590 --> 03:50.889
- You have to cut that part out.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.319
(small chuckle)

03:53.360 --> 03:56.295
- No, of course,
you found him here,

03:56.330 --> 03:59.891
not because of the exhibit,

03:59.940 --> 04:03.330
but because of the crowd
It attracts.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.971
You had him, Jack.
He was beaten.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.547
Why didn't you kill him?

04:13.980 --> 04:16.483
(Jack sighs.)

04:16.520 --> 04:20.786
- Maybe I need you to.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.067
- I want to be able to draw
these streets from memory.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.705
I want to be able to draw
the Palazzo Vecchio

04:37.740 --> 04:39.708
and the Duomo.

04:39.740 --> 04:43.642
- You won't be coming back here
for a very long time.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.510
- Memories of Florence
Will be all I have.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.886
Florence is where
I became a man.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.425
I see my end in my beginning.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.861
- All of our endings can be
found in our beginnings.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.869
History repeats itself,

05:07.900 --> 05:09.902
and there is no escape.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.609
- You've packed lightly.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.641
- I packed for you.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.439
This is where I leave you.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.879
Or more accurately,

05:26.920 --> 05:28.911
where you leave me.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.623
- This isn't how I intended
to say goodbye.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.628
I imagined it differently.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.663
- I didn't.

05:43.670 --> 05:47.379
I knew that you
intended to eat me,

05:47.410 --> 05:49.901
and I knew that you had

05:49.950 --> 05:52.544
no intention _
of eating me hastily.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.441
- Would be a shame
not to savour you.

05:58.490 --> 06:02.654
- I have not marinated
long enough for your tastes.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.894
When they come for you...

06:06.930 --> 06:08.898
- And they will come...

06:08.930 --> 06:12.058
- ...what will you say of me?

06:14.470 --> 06:17.701
- I will help you tell
the version of events
you want to be told.

06:17.740 --> 06:22.507
I will help you
because you asked me to.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.047
- You may make a meal
of me yet, Hannibal...

06:43.600 --> 06:45.727
...but not today.

06:51.140 --> 06:54.632
(theme music)

07:23.140 --> 07:25.859
(classical music playing)
(chopping sounds)

07:27.140 --> 07:30.849
- Pig tails
cut into sections to give

07:30.880 --> 07:33.110
the aesthetic of fingers
cut at the joint.

07:33.150 --> 07:35.516
- Finger food. Ha!

07:35.550 --> 07:37.711
- Hands are how
we touch the world.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.753
They're tactile... sensual.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.155
Remove an arm and your patient

07:42.190 --> 07:44.727
will still feel phantom digits.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.548
Imagine how Dr. Lecter will feel

07:48.600 --> 07:52.092
while he's watching you
nibble his fingers.

07:52.130 --> 07:55.588
- Oh, poetry, Cordell. Poetry.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.961
- In a ginger-black
vinegar sauce.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.006
- Mmmm. It's mostly skin
and bone.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.644
Oh!
- The actual fingers

08:05.680 --> 08:09.241
will have more meat.
Then, there's the marrow.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.579
Here it is in a fermented

08:12.620 --> 08:15.509
bean sauce.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.529
- Ah, I prefer the ginger.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.225
- No, no.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.796
Spit.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.764
(spitting)
(Ding!)

08:25.800 --> 08:28.963
(Cordell laughing)
- A Buddhist singing bowl.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.707
The gong represents
the start of a new day.

08:31.740 --> 08:35.574
- Buddhists don't eat meat.
- This isn't meat...

08:35.610 --> 08:38.204
this is man.

08:40.080 --> 08:43.743
- Papa always used to say
meat was a people business.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.985
He was a pioneer
in livestock production;

08:46.020 --> 08:48.682
I'm sure he's eaten someone.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.086
I must admit a tremble
at the notion myself.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.894
- I find there's _
something reassuring

08:53.930 --> 08:56.091
about you eating Dr. Lecter.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.223
It makes you the apex predator.

08:58.270 --> 09:01.159
- I like that. "Apex predator."

09:03.070 --> 09:06.164
- We could... Peking duck him.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.973
- Oh?

09:08.010 --> 09:11.241
- You have to torture
a duck to prepare it.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.669
Pump its skin up with air,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.676
then glaze it with a hot honey

09:15.720 --> 09:18.143
and hang it by its neck
until it dries.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.648
- And then roast until crispy.

09:21.690 --> 09:24.750
(classical music playing)

09:24.790 --> 09:27.827
(sizzle)

09:43.650 --> 09:46.369
Transubstantiation.

09:46.410 --> 09:49.686
(phone ringing)

09:58.660 --> 10:01.754
I'm here. Tell me.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.667
(woman on TV speaking Italian)

10:16.750 --> 10:20.379
I feel like Ijust paid a lot
of money for a dead dago.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.639
- The feces will
fly about Paul.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.988
- Better get it out
that Pazzi was dirty.

10:26.020 --> 10:29.114
They'll take it better
if he was dirty. Was he dirty?

10:29.160 --> 10:32.027
- Except for this,
I don't know.

10:34.060 --> 10:36.199
- What if they trace Pazzi

10:36.230 --> 10:38.425
back to you?

10:38.470 --> 10:40.358
- (disfigured man): Oh, I can
take care of that.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.368
- You took care of Pazzi.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.107
- I have little interest

10:45.140 --> 10:47.176
in the expensive piece of meat

10:47.210 --> 10:50.099
twitching on the end of that
electrical cord, Dr. Bloom.

10:52.210 --> 10:55.270
- Hannibal could disappear
too well and you'd be
left with nothing.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.311
- (seated woman):
Better buy another cop.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.256
- Better buy
the whole department.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.141
(tapping her arm)

11:39.330 --> 11:41.355
- You must be looking
for Hannibal Lecter.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.062
One of his patients?

11:46.100 --> 11:49.137
- No, not a patient.

11:49.170 --> 11:52.901
Where is he?

11:52.940 --> 11:54.874
- Seeing how you let
yourself in,

11:54.910 --> 11:56.844
forgive me if it's forward
of me to ask,

11:56.880 --> 11:59.371
who the hell are you?

11:59.410 --> 12:01.844
- Family.

12:04.520 --> 12:09.355
- And you've come
all the way from home.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.858
- Who are you?

12:11.890 --> 12:15.018
- I'm his psychiatrist.

12:20.470 --> 12:22.438
Medicinal purposes.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.166
- You're like his bird.

12:26.210 --> 12:29.134
I'm his bird, too.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.307
He puts us in cages

12:31.350 --> 12:33.944
to see what we'll do.
- Fly away

12:33.980 --> 12:37.939
or dash ourselves dead
against the bars.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.958
- You haven't flown away.

12:39.990 --> 12:44.120
- You are flying right
towards him. How does he

12:44.160 --> 12:47.254
inspire such devotion?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.256
- You're his psychiatrist.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.188
- You could add
to what I've learned

12:54.240 --> 12:56.435
from my experience with him

12:56.470 --> 13:00.270
and from the mute postures
of the dead.

13:00.310 --> 13:03.848
Were you there?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.201
Did you watch

13:06.250 --> 13:08.377
as the wild beast within him

13:08.420 --> 13:10.388
turned from the teat

13:10.420 --> 13:13.082
and entered the world?

13:15.260 --> 13:17.353
- I met the beast...

13:17.390 --> 13:19.358
and I saw him grow.

13:19.390 --> 13:22.097
Someone wants to kill him.

13:22.130 --> 13:25.019
- More than one
someone, I'd say.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.204
What do you want?

13:30.240 --> 13:34.802
- I want to cage him.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.008
- I thought Will Graham was
Hannibal's biggest mistake...

13:42.450 --> 13:45.180
...I wonder if it isn't you.

13:45.220 --> 13:49.452
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:49.490 --> 13:53.221
I have to take my medicine.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.230
***

14:23.530 --> 14:26.158
(tick-tock)

14:38.270 --> 14:40.272
(knocking on door)

14:48.950 --> 14:52.442
(knocking on door)

14:55.560 --> 14:58.358
- Mrs. Fell, I presume?

15:15.540 --> 15:19.078
- My husband is a doctor.

15:19.110 --> 15:21.078
He's been treating
my condition.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.442
- And what condition
is that... Mrs. Fell?

15:24.490 --> 15:27.254
- I get confused.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.554
- Oh, please.
You need to get

15:29.590 --> 15:33.651
over yourself, whatever self
that is, Bedelia.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.723
- My name is Lydia Fell.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.661
- You expect us to believe
that you somehow

15:41.700 --> 15:44.533
lost yourself in

15:44.570 --> 15:48.336
the hot darkness
of Hannibal Lecter's mind?

15:48.380 --> 15:52.146
That Lydia Fell
is some construct?

15:59.350 --> 16:01.352
- It's you, isn't it?

16:01.390 --> 16:04.382
- Well, now I'm really confused.

16:07.330 --> 16:10.265
-I”.dont”.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.291
believe you.

16:17.470 --> 16:19.665
- You...

16:19.710 --> 16:21.678
are not confused...

16:21.710 --> 16:24.076
Bedelia.

16:24.110 --> 16:27.147
- That is not my name.
- Oh, you know

16:27.180 --> 16:29.648
who you are and what you've
done, and you know exactly

16:29.680 --> 16:31.648
how you're going to wiggle
out of it. What is this?

16:31.690 --> 16:34.250
Sedatives? Hypnotics?

16:34.290 --> 16:36.087
Ethanol? Scopolamine?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.020
Midazolam? _
- Same cocktail

16:38.060 --> 16:40.199
Dr. l__e_cter served
Miriam Lass.

16:40.230 --> 16:42.528
You've been freebasing
your alibi.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.199
And I'm not even mad at you.

16:45.230 --> 16:48.358
To tell the truth,
I'm fairly impressed.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.062
- Mostly because
you're still alive.

16:51.110 --> 16:55.399
When this fog of yours clears...

16:55.440 --> 16:57.647
I'd love to hear
how you managed that.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.443
- You say my husband

16:59.480 --> 17:02.210
murdered a chief investigator.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.445
Where is the polizia?

17:06.450 --> 17:08.680
Shouldn't they be
questioning me?

17:11.390 --> 17:14.154
- They will.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.499
- They sure are
taking their time.

17:19.500 --> 17:23.209
What could possibly be
the delay?

17:23.240 --> 17:25.765
I have an idea.

17:28.110 --> 17:30.078
Do you?

17:30.110 --> 17:32.305
- They're being bought

17:32.350 --> 17:35.717
by the same people
that bought Rinaldo Pazzi.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.786
- Interest in my husband is

17:37.820 --> 17:41.779
certainly getting competitive.

17:44.490 --> 17:47.323
- Will?

17:47.360 --> 17:51.296
Will?
- I wonder
who will catch him first.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.666
- I've made new friends
in Italy.

17:59.710 --> 18:03.601
They're cleaning up and
starting over, so all you need

18:03.650 --> 18:06.505
to concern yourself with now
is what will happen

18:06.550 --> 18:08.643
_once Dr. Lecter
is in your hands.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.444
- You've worked so hard
to give me what I want.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.880
It's only fair to talk
about what Margot wants.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.127
Come sit on Santa's lap, huh?

18:22.860 --> 18:26.364
- You know what I want.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.392
- The biggest regret of my life

18:29.440 --> 18:31.431
is taking away your ability

18:31.470 --> 18:33.529
to create it.
- Adoption

18:33.580 --> 18:36.674
is a nice thing to do.
- No pedigree in buying

18:36.710 --> 18:39.201
a Chinese baby.
They're cheaper than shoats.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.810
I wish I could
give you a Verger baby,

18:41.850 --> 18:44.842
our own baby. Yours and mine.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.757
We could raise it together.

18:47.790 --> 18:50.520
- The last time you said
you wanted to have a baby,

18:50.560 --> 18:53.427
you removed my uterus.
- In my defense,

18:53.460 --> 18:55.553
you weaponized your uterus.
You shouldn't have been

18:55.600 --> 18:57.568
waving it around
like a loaded pistol.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.795
- I brought it on myself.

18:59.830 --> 19:03.630
- As you so often do, Margot.

19:03.670 --> 19:06.161
But there's a possibility
that I'm still packing

19:06.210 --> 19:09.907
loads of viable sperm.

19:09.940 --> 19:14.513
_ Stumbled across
any Viable uteruses lately, hm?

19:14.550 --> 19:16.814
- What are you up to, Mason?

19:16.850 --> 19:19.683
- I want us
to have a baby, Margot.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.883
I could be really good
to a child.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.424
I could take parenting classes.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.588
Let's find a way, Margot.

19:29.630 --> 19:34.329
Let's find a way
to be a family again, hmm?

19:36.940 --> 19:38.931
***

20:12.010 --> 20:14.205
(Will groans.)

20:20.280 --> 20:22.248
(Will sighs.)

20:22.280 --> 20:24.612
- If I saw you every day,

20:24.650 --> 20:26.641
forever, Will,

20:26.690 --> 20:29.784
I would remember this time.

20:31.430 --> 20:34.251
- Strange seeing you
here in front of me.

20:36.060 --> 20:39.427
Been staring at afterimages
of you in places you haven't

20:39.470 --> 20:41.438
been in years.

20:44.570 --> 20:47.869
- "To market, to market,
to buy a fat pig.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.572
Home again, home again,
JIggIty-JIg-"

20:53.380 --> 20:56.372
- I wanted to understand you

20:56.420 --> 20:59.389
before I laid eyes on you again.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.826
I needed it to be clear...

21:04.860 --> 21:06.680
(swallowing)

21:06.730 --> 21:09.324
...what I was seeing.

21:12.370 --> 21:14.429
- Where does the difference
between the past

21:14.470 --> 21:17.064
and the future come from?

21:17.100 --> 21:19.705
- Mine?

21:21.740 --> 21:24.868
Before you and after you.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.814
Yours?

21:30.820 --> 21:33.857
It's all starting to blur.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.481
Mischa.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.454
Abigail.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.764
Chiyoh.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.832
- How is Chiyoh?

21:48.870 --> 21:53.478
- She pushed me off a train.

21:53.510 --> 21:55.831
- Atta girl.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.118
- You and I

22:01.150 --> 22:05.348
have begun to blur.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.652
(Will sighs.)

22:11.690 --> 22:13.794
- Isn't that how you found me?

22:16.430 --> 22:19.797
- Every crime of yours...

22:19.830 --> 22:22.799
feels like one I am guilty of.

22:26.470 --> 22:30.770
Not just Abigail's murder,
every murder...

22:30.810 --> 22:34.769
stretching backward
and forward in time.

22:37.020 --> 22:39.716
- Freeing yourself
from me and...

22:39.750 --> 22:43.015
me freeing myself from you,

22:43.060 --> 22:45.551
they are the same.

22:45.590 --> 22:48.093
- We're conjoined.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.030
I'm curious

22:54.070 --> 22:56.868
whether either of us can

22:56.900 --> 22:59.698
survive separation.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.608
- Now is the hardest test:

23:07.650 --> 23:10.710
not letting rage
and frustration...

23:12.720 --> 23:16.383
...nor forgiveness
keep you from thinking.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.774
Shall we?

23:33.810 --> 23:36.131
(Will groans.)

23:39.580 --> 23:41.741
- After you.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.159
(gunshot with silencer)

26:47.940 --> 26:49.896
- Mason's ahead of the FBI

26:49.940 --> 26:51.965
in the pursuit
of Hannibal Lecter.

26:52.010 --> 26:55.605
- Mason has no intention of ever
sharing his lead with the FBI.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.305
- I do...

27:05.020 --> 27:07.147
...once he has Hannibal.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.685
- There is something I need
to get from Mason

27:11.730 --> 27:13.721
before he goes to prison.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.227
Any experience harvesting sperm?

27:22.470 --> 27:24.700
- (with Italian accent):
We cannot locate Dr. Fell.

27:29.240 --> 27:32.778
Close attention has been
brought to bear on him.

27:32.810 --> 27:35.119
We have eyewitness accounts
of a bloody figure,

27:35.150 --> 27:37.118
matching his description,

27:37.150 --> 27:39.880
running from the scene.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.150
The Italian public
has already decided

27:42.190 --> 27:44.829
il Mostro has killed
Rinaldo Pazzi.

27:44.860 --> 27:47.420
A 20-year-old debt finally paid.

27:47.460 --> 27:49.951
- The Italian public is right.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.026
- Il Mostro died in prison.

27:53.070 --> 27:55.994
Il Commandator Pazzi

27:56.040 --> 27:58.031
had been assigned
to investigate

27:58.070 --> 28:00.209
the disappearance of two men
from the Palazzo Capponi.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.232
- My husband knew
Professor Sogliato.

28:03.280 --> 28:07.341
We were at his home many times.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.816
- We believe your husband was
responsible for the
disappearances

28:10.850 --> 28:15.389
and murdered Pazzi when_ he came
to the same conclu5ion.

28:15.420 --> 28:18.025
- If you haven't already,

28:18.060 --> 28:20.324
access the ViCAP
database at Quantico.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.999
You'll find Dr. Fell
on the Most-Wanted page,

28:25.330 --> 28:27.491
The fingerprints
you'll pull from Pazzi's noose

28:27.530 --> 28:29.737
will be his.
- If you knew

28:29.770 --> 28:31.806
Dr. Fell to be
Hannibal Lecter,

28:31.840 --> 28:34.331
why didn't you bring it to
the attention of the Questura?

28:34.380 --> 28:38.043
- He had a price on his head.
Pazzi knew about it,
tried to sell him.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.969
For that kind of money,
I can't blame him.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.341
Can you?

28:43.380 --> 28:46.110
(amused exclamation)

28:46.150 --> 28:48.311
- You've already been questioned

28:48.360 --> 28:50.988
regarding Rinaldo Pazzi's
murder, Signor Crawford.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.295
Since you're not in Florence
on official FBI business,

28:54.330 --> 28:56.093
that will be all.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.164
Not you, Signora Fell.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.998
You stay right where you are.

29:09.810 --> 29:11.072
(Sigh)

29:21.290 --> 29:25.329
(Will panting)

29:30.430 --> 29:32.398
- This is gonna hurt.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.398
The bullet is still inside you.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.931
(Will panting)

29:36.970 --> 29:39.962
(Will grunting in pain
and panting)

29:49.450 --> 29:52.089
Chiyoh has always been
very protective of me.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.088
(Will laughing)

29:54.120 --> 29:56.350
Did she kill her tenant,

29:56.390 --> 29:58.585
or did you?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.928
- She did.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.155
- Excellent.

30:13.070 --> 30:15.072
You dropped
your forgiveness, Will.

30:15.110 --> 30:18.147
You forgive how God forgives.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.371
Would you have done it quickly?

30:23.420 --> 30:25.888
Or would you have
stopped to gloat?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.480
- Does God gloat?

30:30.290 --> 30:32.178
- Often.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.054
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.920
Ugh!

30:38.970 --> 30:41.598
(Will panting)

30:41.640 --> 30:45.030
(Will breathing easier)

31:02.590 --> 31:06.856
- Give that a moment.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.976
(scraping on metal)

31:29.020 --> 31:33.013
(something sizzling)

31:33.050 --> 31:36.952
- I can almost taste the butter.

31:36.990 --> 31:39.527
- Taste and smell
are the oldest senses

31:39.560 --> 31:43.428
and the closest
to the center of the mind.

31:43.460 --> 31:47.362
- (Will): Parts that precede
pity and morality.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.698
- They play in the dome
of our skulls,

31:49.740 --> 31:54.370
like miracles illuminated
on a church ceiling.

31:54.410 --> 31:58.506
The ceremonies and sights
and exchanges of dinner

31:58.550 --> 32:02.338
can be far more engaging
than theater.

32:10.090 --> 32:12.524
- What's for dinner?

32:12.560 --> 32:14.528
- Never ask.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.326
Spoils the surprise.

32:45.090 --> 32:47.081
- No, no.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.309
- I don't indulge
much in regret, but...

33:10.350 --> 33:12.682
I am sorry to be
leaving Italy.

33:17.390 --> 33:19.426
There were things
in the Palazzo Capponi

33:19.460 --> 33:21.655
I would have liked to read.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.689
I would have liked
to play the clavier...

33:27.730 --> 33:30.563
and perhaps compose.

33:40.180 --> 33:44.116
I would have liked
to show you Florence, Will.

33:44.150 --> 33:47.039
- Soup isn't very good.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.294
- It's a parsley
and thyme infusion,

33:54.330 --> 33:57.356
and more for my sake than yours.

34:01.470 --> 34:04.064
Have another sip.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.179
Let that circulate.

34:13.780 --> 34:16.044
- Are we expecting company?

35:50.410 --> 35:52.446
- Wr-wrong floor.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.828
(muffled Italian song playing)

36:09.460 --> 36:12.258
(tick-tock)
(something sizzling)

36:12.300 --> 36:14.632
(Italian song playing)

36:27.450 --> 36:30.817
(louder sizzling)
(Italian song still playing)

36:47.830 --> 36:49.832
- Will.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.766
- He is under the table, Jack.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.203
- Argh!

37:07.790 --> 37:10.816
- Your husband left you behind.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.451
- I had no reason to run.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.718
I've done nothing wrong.

37:20.770 --> 37:22.738
- I hold in my hands

37:22.770 --> 37:24.761
the photographs

37:24.810 --> 37:28.029
taken for Dr. Fell's
State work permit.

37:28.070 --> 37:31.471
Oh. I also have his French

37:31.510 --> 37:33.705
work papers.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.719
Looks different
with a beard, no?

37:39.420 --> 37:43.311
- That is not my husband.
- This is Roman Fell.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.352
And this is Lydia Fell.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.722
- I am Lydia Fell.

37:56.870 --> 38:01.000
- Did you murder her
with your husband?

38:01.040 --> 38:03.907
Or did you just watch?

38:03.940 --> 38:08.001
- I... am Lydia Fell.

38:11.820 --> 38:15.586
- I don't care who you are.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.453
I don't care if
you're in your right mind

38:18.490 --> 38:21.618
or your wrong mind. Understand?

38:21.660 --> 38:24.959
Those things are
inconsequential.

38:28.070 --> 38:32.507
- I understand.
In this moment,

38:32.540 --> 38:35.577
you do not work
for the Questura.

38:35.610 --> 38:38.477
-Hmmm

38:38.510 --> 38:41.843
That's a good thing
to understand.

38:41.880 --> 38:46.488
- I do not want to be seen
as... uncooperative.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.788
- How you're seen
is entirely up to you.

38:53.790 --> 38:58.022
Rescued by
the brave Questura or...

38:58.060 --> 39:00.062
apprehended.

39:02.070 --> 39:06.029
- I've never considered myself
in need of being...

39:06.070 --> 39:09.904
rescued, until now.

39:09.940 --> 39:13.341
- Is your husband
still in the city?

39:15.780 --> 39:18.908
- My husband was hoping
to meet a friend

39:18.950 --> 39:22.386
before he left Florence.

39:22.420 --> 39:23.887
- Where?

39:23.920 --> 39:27.526
- The nature of the meeting
required privacy.

39:27.560 --> 39:30.893
They will be somewhere

39:30.930 --> 39:33.763
no one is supposed to be.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.618
- I've taken the liberty
of giving you

39:48.650 --> 39:50.811
something to help you relax.

39:50.850 --> 39:53.114
Won't be able to do
much more than chew,

39:53.150 --> 39:55.186
but that's all
you'll need to do.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.688
I didn't have

39:57.720 --> 40:00.621
an opportunity to ask you
during our last encounter,

40:00.660 --> 40:02.719
but did you enjoy
the exhibition?

40:02.760 --> 40:05.593
A different kind
of evil minds museum...

40:07.530 --> 40:09.566
- Not that different.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.807
We were supposed
to sit down together

40:14.840 --> 40:17.707
at your house in Baltimore,

40:17.740 --> 40:20.675
just the three of us.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.678
- You were to be
the guest of honour.

40:24.950 --> 40:28.078
- But the menu was all wrong.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.156
- Yes, it was.

40:37.560 --> 40:41.064
Jack was the first to suggest
getting inside your head.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.731
Now, we both have
the opportunity

40:46.770 --> 40:48.772
to chew quite literally...

40:51.550 --> 40:53.802
...what we've only
chewed figuratively.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.946
(saw buzzing)

40:58.990 --> 41:00.981
- Hannibal...

41:07.790 --> 41:09.553
Stop!

41:13.600 --> 41:17.696
(silent screaming)

41:49.800 --> 41:52.701

41:56.110 --> 41:59.045

42:21.800 --> 42:24.098

42:24.140 --> 42:27.564
welcome to Muskrat Farm.
