01:54.031 --> 01:55.240
Watch your step.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.576
- David?
- Watch your step.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.703
I'm looking for David.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.830
He ain't in here, lady.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.356
- David?
- You're mistaken.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.530
David...

02:35.030 --> 02:38.450
I've been looking everywhere for you. I thought I'd lost you.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.370
David? My name isn't David, lady.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.038
What?

03:24.997 --> 03:27.624
Okay. You, lady?

03:28.750 --> 03:29.960
Coffee?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.507
Would you reach me the sugar?

03:36.091 --> 03:39.052
Hey, you. Say, you drunk?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.889
Here's your coffee.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.849
Hey, what's the matter with you?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.894
- She looks sick.
- Are you sick or something?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.817
- Where did you pick her up?
- Sixth and Main.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.777
Does she show any signs of physical injury?

05:18.819 --> 05:21.154
Not as far as we could make out.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.034
How many fingers?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.328
Pulse low and irregular.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.081
What's your name?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.417
Can you hear me?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.460
It looks like a coma.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.629
- Diabetic?
- I don't think so.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.049
- It's a non-traumatic stupor.
- Take her to Psycho.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.726
How many does this make?

06:32.809 --> 06:36.230
Twenty today. One manic, three seniles...

06:36.647 --> 06:40.067
- six alcoholics, and 10 schizos.
- Going up all the time.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.863
This civilization of ours is a worse disease than heart trouble or tuberculosis.

06:44.905 --> 06:48.242
We can't escape it. Well, what have we here?

06:48.408 --> 06:51.870
Catatonic stupor. She was in shock, but she's out now.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.080
I see.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.500
Beautiful woman, intelligent...

06:57.167 --> 06:58.544
frustrated.

06:59.962 --> 07:03.215
Frustrated, just like the others we've seen. It's always the same.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.636
Problem of some kind.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.932
Simple, perhaps, but she was unable to cope with it. And now this.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.352
Complete confusion.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.897
Hypoactive deep reflexes throughout.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.902
Catatonic posturing, waxy flexibility of the extremities.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.949
Your diagnosis was correct, Craig. Let me see the chart.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.830
"Name unknown. Previous medical history, unknown.

07:34.913 --> 07:39.042
"Age, education, profession, if any, unknown." All unknown.

07:40.627 --> 07:44.590
"Patient's clothing bears label from stores in Washington, D.C.

07:45.257 --> 07:49.011
"Woman who saw her on the street said she was asking for a man called David."

07:49.303 --> 07:52.347
That's something to go on, at least. Not much, but something.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.432
Anyway.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.434
David.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.397
Well, hello, there.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.068
I'm Dr. Willard. We're going to help you.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.613
Feeling better?

08:08.864 --> 08:11.283
Better? Much better.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.412
You come from Washington, don't you? Washington, D. C.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.414
Where do you live in Washington?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.876
Well, what's this?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.128
You're married, aren't you?

08:24.505 --> 08:26.006
What's your husband's name?

08:26.507 --> 08:28.675
Is your husband's name David?

08:30.511 --> 08:31.720
What's your name?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.515
You can talk, you know. You just did.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.269
You said "David." Now you don't say anything.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.104
Why is that?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.150
Well, tell me this, at least. How do you feel?

08:46.610 --> 08:48.654
I said, "How do you feel?"

08:54.326 --> 08:55.369
I...

08:59.540 --> 09:00.791
feel...

09:00.958 --> 09:02.668
That's fine, go on.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.756
I...

09:08.382 --> 09:10.300
You can't find the words, can you?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.302
You want to, but you can't.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.680
Something preventing you, is that it?

09:15.389 --> 09:17.683
Just nod your head if I'm right.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.395
I see.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.439
We'll have to do something about that.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.151
She shows marked thought blocking, almost complete mutism.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.737
Now, then...

09:31.572 --> 09:34.700
in order to help you, we've got to find out something about you...

09:35.075 --> 09:36.702
and to find out about you...

09:36.743 --> 09:39.079
we've got to make it possible for you to talk.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.373
We'll try narcosynthesis.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.710
Seven-and-a-half grains in 10 cc's of sterile distilled water.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.044
Yes, Dr. Willard.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.465
That's fine. It's not going to hurt.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.803
It will just help you to tell us what we want to know.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.055
Don't you want to talk to us?

10:00.142 --> 10:02.644
In a few seconds you're going to be able to talk.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.772
I want you to tell me what you're thinking.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.528
Every time I see the reaction to this treatment...

10:11.612 --> 10:14.406
I get exactly the same thrill that I did the first time.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.449
Miss Rosen...

10:16.283 --> 10:18.202
elevate the head of the bed, please.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.996
Now watch, Craig.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.168
There! That's better, isn't it?

10:28.253 --> 10:31.298
Now you can think much more clearly, can't you?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.091
That's much better.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.470
Much better.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.853
It's all right. You're in a hospital.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.274
Hospital?

10:51.193 --> 10:52.736
What hospital?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.155
Why?

10:55.280 --> 10:58.784
You became very ill in a restaurant. Don't you remember?

11:00.869 --> 11:01.912
No.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.874
I don't believe you.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.670
- I'd like to leave now.
- All right.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.507
You help us to make you well again, then you can leave.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.759
That's fair enough, isn't it?

11:16.468 --> 11:18.095
What's your name?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.348
Louise Howell.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.350
You live in Washington?

11:24.685 --> 11:26.270
Why are you in Los Angeles?

11:28.146 --> 11:30.941
- To get away from them.
- From them?

11:32.943 --> 11:35.779
- They must never know.
- What mustn't they ever know?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.365
That's why I came here.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.285
I wanted to disappear.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.830
- They must never know.
- Now, now.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.582
Don't get excited.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.668
What is it you don't want them to know?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.672
I'm not going to tell you everything.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.925
All right. You just tell me what you want to, that's all.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.388
Tell me about... David.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.395
- David?
- Yes. Who is David?

12:11.648 --> 12:14.359
Someone's playing Schumann on the piano.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.906
- I don't like it.
- No one's playing the piano, really.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.575
Yes.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.120
Listen. There.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.372
Hear it?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.668
I don't like it.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.838
Make them play it softer.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.764
That's better. It's nice.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.226
That's fine. Tell me...

12:47.809 --> 12:49.228
who was playing the piano?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.271
David.

12:52.648 --> 12:56.068
We were swimming, it was cold.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.404
Now he's playing Schumann.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.618
What're you doing? Louise?

13:04.701 --> 13:07.621
I'm getting dressed, it's almost time to go.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.208
We never seem to have enough time together.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.376
What?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.962
I said, we never seem to have enough time together.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.049
The days aren't long enough.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.884
Not our days.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.096
The others are too long.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.517
You aren't even listening.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.270
I'm making love to the piano.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.648
One of my more attractive minor accomplishments.

13:36.108 --> 13:39.611
For Miss Louise Howell, Schumann.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.906
And for the other women you've known?

13:43.156 --> 13:46.577
The other women? It depends. Gershwin...

13:47.369 --> 13:50.289
something light and frivolous, Mozart.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.292
But for you, Schumann.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.753
- Tenderness.
- Thank you.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.228
I wish I hadn't gotten dressed. We could go swimming again.

14:13.729 --> 14:17.107
It would be lovely swimming in the moonlight. Beautiful.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.817
It would be too cold.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.237
You haven't enough romance in your soul.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.781
- Why don't you go?
- Alone?

14:25.657 --> 14:27.367
It wouldn't be any fun that way.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.120
Besides, I have to leave soon.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.123
Will you miss me?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.043
Will you be Ionely?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.256
Do you love me?

14:43.550 --> 14:46.011
You say the most beautiful things.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.767
Your hair's still wet from swimming, back there.

14:52.226 --> 14:53.644
You know that?

14:53.810 --> 14:55.354
Smells wonderful.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.690
Why do they still make perfumes like Bouquet de Fleurs...

14:58.774 --> 15:01.485
as if things still happened in flower gardens?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.862
If they turned out something like...

15:04.363 --> 15:07.866
Wet Hair After Swimming, they'd have something.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.332
I love you, David.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.171
"I love you" is such an inadequate way of saying I love you.

15:22.381 --> 15:25.133
It doesn't quite describe how much it hurts sometimes.

15:27.386 --> 15:30.138
Love gives me the sniffles, and then my nose gets red.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.642
- Why?
- Because I'm happy, because I'm in love.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.436
- That's no reason.
- Yes, it is.

15:36.854 --> 15:38.313
At least for a woman, it is.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.400
Would you like to know something?

15:42.109 --> 15:43.193
What?

15:45.279 --> 15:46.488
Before I met you...

15:46.613 --> 15:49.533
I never felt very keenly one way or another about anything.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.828
- I wasn't happy, I...
- Sad?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.622
No, I just existed.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.919
I never realized what a dreary life it was, till I met you.

16:02.838 --> 16:05.048
David, I want a monopoly on you.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.970
Or whatever people have, when they don't want anyone else to have any of you.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.430
Don't, Louise.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.934
Don't what?

16:16.143 --> 16:19.188
Don't start bringing the subject around to marriage again.

16:21.523 --> 16:26.028
<i>I like all kinds of music except a little number called Oh, Promise Me.</i>

16:26.862 --> 16:30.616
- Why? What's wrong with it?
- It's a duet and I like to play solo.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.620
I'm not in love with you like that, you know that.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.246
Not like that.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.920
Don't be angry.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.255
- I'm not angry.
- Yes, you are.

16:46.798 --> 16:50.594
Why is it when a man gets interested in his work, or a book, or something...

16:50.844 --> 16:53.972
a woman has to always start acting like a woman?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.643
Because she doesn't want him to get lost in anything but her.

16:58.477 --> 17:01.522
Darling, in mathematics you never, never lose yourself.

17:01.647 --> 17:04.233
In life, very often. In love, always.

17:04.942 --> 17:09.238
But in mathematics, two and two are always four. And that's wonderful.

17:10.739 --> 17:11.990
Let me show you this.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.118
You see?

17:16.619 --> 17:17.954
It's just a curve.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.083
Well, yes, it's a parabola.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.336
That's something that a mathematician could fall in love with.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.713
I've been working on that for over four years.

17:26.797 --> 17:29.216
I started when I was in the army, in Africa.

17:29.466 --> 17:32.261
It's a girder, a molded girder.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.179
The army couldn't use it...

17:34.221 --> 17:37.266
but a construction engineer would give his right arm for that.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.520
Why don't you love me like that?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.982
I'm much nicer than a girder and a lot more interesting.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.281
I have no pride, you didn't know that, did you?

18:00.956 --> 18:02.166
David...

18:02.666 --> 18:06.044
I've never had anything in the whole world I ever wanted, except you.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.673
I used to be cold, shut in, I didn't mind because...

18:10.215 --> 18:12.718
nothing hurt me very much then, but...

18:13.510 --> 18:17.306
I just can't go back being on the outside of people's lives, looking in.

18:18.182 --> 18:21.977
Louise, we're all on the outside of other people's lives looking in.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.480
You wouldn't like being on the inside of my life, anyway.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.734
There's nothing there but a few mathematical equations...

18:28.817 --> 18:30.402
and a lot of question marks.

18:30.527 --> 18:34.740
Darling, I honestly think we'd better not see each other for a while.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.366
Why?

18:37.784 --> 18:40.245
- Why, David, what have I done?
- Nothing.

18:40.287 --> 18:44.041
Knowing you has been wonderful, but you hang on to me too hard.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.044
Sometimes I get the feeling that you're choking me to death.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.380
Everyone wants to be loved, but no one wants to be smothered.

18:51.924 --> 18:54.051
This whole thing, it's getting too involved.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.345
It was never meant to go this far, you know that.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.389
- We agreed to that a long time ago.
- I know, but...

18:59.473 --> 19:02.434
it's the sort of thing that people say before they fall in love.

19:02.476 --> 19:05.771
Louise, I hadn't wanted to tell you this for a while...

19:05.896 --> 19:07.606
but I think, now, maybe I should.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.733
- I've had...
- David, please take me home.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.486
- Waiting won't make it easier.
- Take me home, David.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.096
David, I can't run away from it any longer.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.891
What were you going to tell me?

20:23.974 --> 20:28.270
I don't know what I want just now, but I have to keep moving until I get it.

20:29.229 --> 20:33.317
Blame it on the army, blame it on the war, blame it on anything you like, but...

20:33.650 --> 20:36.278
- that's the way it is.
- All right, go.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.030
Go wherever you like.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.283
But let me wait for you. At least let me do that.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.286
No. I won't be back this way.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.164
Louise, you have got to let go.

20:47.623 --> 20:50.876
I can't love you the way you love me. I never could.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.965
Believe me, someday you're gonna be glad you're rid of me.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.554
Won't you try to understand?

21:48.892 --> 21:52.396
- Nobody caring what happens to me.
- When you're calm, I'll talk to you.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.273
All right, run away.

22:11.165 --> 22:13.333
- Miss Howell.
- Good evening, Mr. Graham.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.170
I understood you were employed to take care of my wife.

22:16.253 --> 22:17.754
- Yes.
- Why don't you?

22:17.963 --> 22:19.631
This is my day off, Mr. Graham.

22:19.715 --> 22:22.301
- I see. Well, go and look after her.
- Yes, sir.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.887
You'll find her rather upset, I'm afraid.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.981
Who is that? Is that you, Dean?

22:36.273 --> 22:38.984
- I told you...
- It's Louise, I'll be with you in a minute.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.237
I don't want you to do anything for me. I won't have you touch me.

22:42.321 --> 22:44.990
Not after what's been going on between you and my husband.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.367
Nothing's been going on, Mrs. Graham, you know that.

22:47.451 --> 22:48.494
Don't try to fool me.

22:48.577 --> 22:51.205
I can tell you're up to something just by looking at you.

22:51.288 --> 22:54.166
Where have you been all day? Who were you with?

22:54.208 --> 22:57.503
No one you'd be interested in. Why don't you try and get some rest?

22:57.669 --> 23:01.757
How can I rest? Lying here all alone, no one to look after me...

23:01.882 --> 23:04.760
nobody to care. Even my own husband hates me.

23:04.843 --> 23:07.971
That's not true, you know he's very upset when you're unhappy.

23:08.055 --> 23:12.309
He should be upset, it's his fault I'm like this. All his fault.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.907
- Is that you, Miss Howell?
- Yes, Mr. Graham.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.784
- Have you a moment?
- Certainly.

23:36.291 --> 23:39.878
I wanted to apologize for being so abrupt when you came in this evening.

23:40.254 --> 23:42.756
I'd just gone through a rather unpleasant half-hour.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.466
I understood that, Mr. Graham.

23:44.675 --> 23:48.095
I imagine you were subjected to much the same sort of thing, just now.

23:48.262 --> 23:52.307
- I hope it wasn't too difficult for you.
- I'm used to difficult patients.

23:55.269 --> 23:57.729
You have a magnificent detachment, Miss Howell.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.606
I wish I might achieve it.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.403
I'm glad you weren't upset by my wife's rather vivid imagination.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.738
No, I wasn't upset, but I wondered...

24:07.865 --> 24:09.074
I think I should leave.

24:09.116 --> 24:11.535
Under the circumstances, I think it would be better.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.371
This has happened before, Miss Howell, many times before.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.708
There's every reason to believe it will happen again.

24:18.125 --> 24:21.044
My wife is fully convinced that I spend all my free time...

24:21.128 --> 24:22.880
making advances to her nurses...

24:22.963 --> 24:25.132
or any other female who enters this house.

24:25.966 --> 24:27.843
Your leaving wouldn't change that.

24:27.926 --> 24:31.346
It would, however, deprive me of your very capable presence.

24:32.389 --> 24:35.726
If you can bring yourself to ignore these fancies of Mrs. Graham...

24:36.310 --> 24:38.353
I'd like very much to have you stay.

24:38.896 --> 24:41.106
- All right, I'll stay.
- Good, it's settled.

24:42.441 --> 24:44.568
I won't bother you any further with my troubles.

24:51.033 --> 24:53.118
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24:53.994 --> 24:56.830
Leave the rest to me, Mr. Graham will want his breakfast.

24:58.916 --> 25:01.418
- Any luck?
- Caught two trout.

25:02.753 --> 25:06.798
I thought I'd save some money and catch my own breakfast. Good idea.

25:07.007 --> 25:09.968
- How long were you out?
- About three hours.

25:10.594 --> 25:13.847
Figuring what your time's worth those fish cost you $1,000 apiece.

25:14.264 --> 25:17.392
I got cheated on Junior. He's only worth about $500.

25:17.768 --> 25:19.478
How's Mrs. Graham this morning?

25:19.520 --> 25:21.855
Feeling well enough to come down here for breakfast.

25:21.939 --> 25:22.940
Good.

25:24.566 --> 25:25.817
That's David Sutton.

25:29.196 --> 25:30.447
Hi, Dean.

25:31.281 --> 25:33.492
- Catch anything?
- Enough for breakfast.

25:34.743 --> 25:36.453
- Can I see you a minute?
- Sure.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.705
You're going to talk business, I'd better go.

25:38.789 --> 25:41.458
Sutton won't mind. I'd like you to meet him.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.961
Some other time, perhaps. I have things to do.

25:44.753 --> 25:45.963
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.549
- You know each other?
- Yes, sure.

25:49.174 --> 25:52.135
I saw you out fishing. I thought I'd drop over and say hello.

25:52.427 --> 25:55.556
- How are Pauline and the kids?
- They're fine. What's on your mind?

25:55.639 --> 25:57.891
You remember our little talk Saturday at the club?

25:57.975 --> 25:59.685
- Vaguely.
- Could we finish it?

26:02.104 --> 26:04.857
Operator, I'm waiting for that call to Montreal.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.733
All right, I'll hold on.

26:06.817 --> 26:09.736
- Some coffee?
- No, thanks. I've had breakfast.

26:10.112 --> 26:12.489
- Don't let me interrupt yours, now.
- I won't.

26:12.698 --> 26:14.533
Now, what about this Canadian deal?

26:15.325 --> 26:18.662
Well, I know your company is surveying a new field up there.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.540
I know you're within six months of production.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.083
All right, I'll hold on.

26:24.126 --> 26:25.711
How do you know all this?

26:26.086 --> 26:29.631
Subterranean rumbles from the underground. It's true, isn't it?

26:29.756 --> 26:33.218
It might be. Why? What particular rumble interests you?

26:33.886 --> 26:36.263
That cracking plant that you're going to build.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.057
You'll need a structural engineer, a good one.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.601
Me.

26:40.726 --> 26:44.062
Someday we must have a long chat about your sources of information.

26:44.313 --> 26:48.734
Maybe we will. Meanwhile, I'm looking for a job. That one.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.778
No, seriously, Dean. You know my record.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.906
You know I'm as good a man as you could get.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.866
Hello, Charlie. Hold on a minute.

26:56.283 --> 26:58.035
When could you leave for Canada?

26:58.202 --> 26:59.703
Tonight, tomorrow, anytime.

27:00.496 --> 27:03.457
Charlie, do you know anything about an engineer named Sutton?

27:03.624 --> 27:05.125
David Sutton.

27:06.627 --> 27:09.713
Do you think he'd be a good man for the Lac du Pont project?

27:12.466 --> 27:13.967
Start packing.

27:18.514 --> 27:19.723
Louise.

27:20.390 --> 27:22.267
Where are you, Louise?

27:22.476 --> 27:24.269
I'm ready to go down.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.150
Hello.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.278
Hello, Louise.

27:33.904 --> 27:35.614
David, I want to talk to you.

27:35.989 --> 27:39.326
- All right. But does it have to be here?
- Here, now.

27:39.952 --> 27:42.704
- What is it?
- I tried to get you on the phone last night.

27:42.788 --> 27:45.123
I tried again this morning, but you weren't at home.

27:45.165 --> 27:46.542
I was home.

27:47.084 --> 27:49.628
Then you wouldn't answer because you knew it was me.

27:50.546 --> 27:53.590
- David, we have no reason to quarrel.
- I agree completely.

27:53.674 --> 27:55.300
I don't know why you're angry with me.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.427
- I'm not angry.
- Please let me finish.

27:57.636 --> 28:00.097
Whatever it is I've done, or you think I've done...

28:00.180 --> 28:03.600
I really haven't done anything, David, but whatever it is, I'm sorry.

28:03.892 --> 28:07.646
You have nothing to be sorry for, you haven't done anything.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.608
I've been thinking about us all night.

28:12.860 --> 28:13.944
I couldn't sleep.

28:14.528 --> 28:17.364
It's awful to lie down at night and not be able to sleep.

28:19.658 --> 28:21.869
But I do know that we can work things out.

28:21.952 --> 28:25.080
I'll do anything you say, David, just as long as we're together.

28:25.205 --> 28:26.498
That's all I want.

28:26.915 --> 28:31.211
- David, why can't we be together?
- I told you why last night.

28:31.295 --> 28:34.214
Louise, don't hang on to me. You'll get hurt.

28:35.132 --> 28:37.342
You're in love with someone else, aren't you?

28:37.426 --> 28:39.386
There isn't anybody else.

28:39.428 --> 28:42.890
Don't please read hidden meanings into everything I say.

28:43.223 --> 28:46.351
If I were in love with anybody else, believe me, I'd tell you.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.812
There is another woman, I know it.

28:48.979 --> 28:52.024
Otherwise why should you suddenly decide to go off to Canada?

28:52.065 --> 28:53.525
How did you know about Canada?

28:53.567 --> 28:56.570
You didn't think I'd find out, did you? But I did, I listened.

28:56.653 --> 28:57.863
I listened at the door.

28:57.946 --> 28:59.740
Do you see the things you make me do?

28:59.823 --> 29:01.825
I'll do anything because I don't care anymore.

29:01.909 --> 29:05.162
You can't go away without me, David. I won't let you. I'll find a way.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.414
I'll lie if I have to, but I'll find a way.

29:11.543 --> 29:15.422
David, I didn't mean that. I don't know why I ever said such a thing.

29:15.506 --> 29:19.092
David, I'm sorry. Please don't be angry.

29:19.426 --> 29:23.096
David, listen to me. You mustn't treat me this way. Don't leave me.

29:23.180 --> 29:24.765
Take me with you. David!

29:33.982 --> 29:35.234
<i>David...</i>

29:35.901 --> 29:37.194
where are you?

29:38.111 --> 29:39.363
Don't leave me.

29:42.866 --> 29:45.244
Now, try and be calm.

29:46.286 --> 29:48.497
Tell me, how did you feel when he left you?

29:49.206 --> 29:50.582
What were you thinking?

29:51.917 --> 29:55.796
He did it deliberately, to humiliate me.

29:57.172 --> 30:00.592
He even pretended it was because I was too much in love with him.

30:02.261 --> 30:03.804
But he didn't fool me any.

30:04.805 --> 30:06.139
He planned it that way.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.434
They all knew about it.

30:10.644 --> 30:11.812
Dean...

30:12.688 --> 30:16.650
his wife, Pauline, the others.

30:18.110 --> 30:20.153
They all did it deliberately.

30:21.238 --> 30:23.657
Just to make me feel miserable.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.410
To make me...

30:27.578 --> 30:28.912
like this.

30:30.998 --> 30:34.293
Try and rest a while. Try not to think of anything.

30:41.341 --> 30:44.136
Do you notice the beginnings of the persecution complex?

30:44.511 --> 30:47.806
"They did it deliberately. Part of a plan. Wanted to hurt me."

30:48.015 --> 30:51.185
No attempt to evaluate the situation or see the man's viewpoint.

30:51.727 --> 30:55.147
No judgment, lack of insight. Classic symptoms.

30:55.689 --> 30:59.610
- This is where the psychosis began.
- Even further back, Doctor.

30:59.693 --> 31:04.531
She said herself that before she met him, she'd never felt anything very keenly.

31:04.615 --> 31:07.034
That's lack of emotional response.

31:07.284 --> 31:11.455
I think the exact term she used was, "I wasn't happy, I wasn't sad."

31:12.331 --> 31:14.750
Typical schizoid detachment, split personality.

31:14.833 --> 31:16.710
Yes, the seeds were there...

31:16.793 --> 31:19.880
and her obsession for this man made them grow.

31:20.923 --> 31:22.591
Well, let's go on.

31:25.427 --> 31:27.054
How do you feel?

31:27.930 --> 31:29.389
Do you want to continue?

31:30.224 --> 31:33.393
Don't go to sleep now. Stay awake and talk to me.

31:34.686 --> 31:36.897
- Would you like to go on?
- Yes.

31:37.731 --> 31:41.527
I'll tell you, I know you can help me.

31:43.403 --> 31:44.696
I know...

31:44.905 --> 31:48.492
- Would you like a glass of water?
- No.

31:50.577 --> 31:54.039
It was black then.

31:54.915 --> 31:58.710
Cold, very cold, and black.

32:51.555 --> 32:52.973
I found her!

32:54.224 --> 32:55.851
Okay, Lieutenant.

33:08.030 --> 33:09.698
I hoped it wouldn't be true.

33:10.324 --> 33:13.494
I feel it's all my fault. If only I hadn't gone into the village.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.454
You weren't to blame.

33:15.829 --> 33:18.832
You look so tired. Why don't you go in the house and lie down?

33:18.874 --> 33:21.418
Let me stay here. I'll do whatever's necessary.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.421
Thank you, Miss Howell. I'll be all right.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.798
Please, Mr. Graham, I'm worried about you.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.344
We were too late, Mr. Graham. Much too late. I'm sorry.

33:30.802 --> 33:34.139
I wonder if you'd mind coming with me for a minute?

33:34.223 --> 33:35.557
Certainly.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.858
I have to make a report.

33:44.942 --> 33:48.070
Just routine, you understand, otherwise I wouldn't trouble you.

33:48.153 --> 33:50.614
I understand your wife used to come here quite often.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.324
Yes, she loved this spot.

33:52.407 --> 33:55.202
She'd suddenly get out of bed and come here and spend hours.

33:55.369 --> 33:56.745
Who are you?

33:56.954 --> 34:00.457
- Louise Howell, Mrs. Graham's nurse.
- Why did Mrs. Graham need a nurse?

34:00.541 --> 34:03.669
She'd been ill for years. She thought she'd never be well again.

34:03.794 --> 34:07.005
However, Dr. Sherman, her physician, can tell you more about that.

34:07.130 --> 34:10.342
I understand Mrs. Graham wasn't missed till about 7:00.

34:10.384 --> 34:13.387
That's right. When the maid took her dinner up, she was gone.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.347
We weren't called until 8:15.

34:15.389 --> 34:17.724
Everyone thought perhaps she'd gone for a walk.

34:17.808 --> 34:20.811
Although she didn't ordinarily do that without telling someone.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.856
When her slippers were found here, I thought it best to call you.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.107
I see.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.693
Where were you all this time, Miss Howell?

34:27.775 --> 34:30.154
I was in the village. This was my day off.

34:30.946 --> 34:32.822
I never should have left her alone.

34:33.239 --> 34:37.119
- I blame myself for this.
- Why should you? It was your day off.

34:37.369 --> 34:39.871
How do you think the accident happened, Mr. Graham?

34:39.996 --> 34:43.041
It wasn't an accident. She did it deliberately.

34:44.585 --> 34:47.880
If you don't want me for anything else, I have some calls to make.

34:48.547 --> 34:51.884
Mr. Graham's children are away at school and they have to be notified.

34:52.092 --> 34:55.219
- Would you like me to tell them?
- No, I'll take care of that.

34:58.098 --> 35:00.309
Do you think it was suicide, Miss Howell?

35:00.976 --> 35:04.104
- She had spells of extreme depression.
- Evidently.

35:06.773 --> 35:08.859
She must've been trapped by the weeds.

35:11.487 --> 35:13.989
Weeds grow very long here, near the shore.

35:14.198 --> 35:16.533
Then, I guess the current carried her out.

35:20.287 --> 35:22.414
The body was found out here.

35:23.290 --> 35:26.919
This is the rock where Mrs. Graham's slippers were found.

35:30.964 --> 35:33.759
- Would you pass that on to the jury?
- Yes.

35:37.971 --> 35:40.682
- What time were you called, Lieutenant? - 8:15.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.851
Sergeant got the call from the house.

35:43.435 --> 35:45.479
We got here about 9:00 and...

35:45.562 --> 35:48.732
we didn't find the body till approximately 2:30 in the morning.

35:48.982 --> 35:51.944
Well, I guess that's all. Except for one thing.

35:52.611 --> 35:54.613
A statement by Mr. Graham.

35:54.988 --> 35:57.574
You don't usually hear a man say a thing like that...

35:57.658 --> 36:00.118
especially about his wife, so I wrote it down.

36:01.078 --> 36:02.246
I asked him:

36:02.329 --> 36:05.666
"How do you think the accident happened, Mr. Graham?"

36:05.749 --> 36:06.959
His exact answer was...

36:07.042 --> 36:10.420
Anything I said that night was not... I was under great strain.

36:10.504 --> 36:13.924
- It's not evidence.
- Just a moment, Dean.

36:14.967 --> 36:18.637
I should like to remind the coroner, that Mr. Graham has not been well.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.139
We' re aware of Mr. Graham's condition, Doctor.

36:21.431 --> 36:24.434
It's largely the reason why this hearing is being held here...

36:24.518 --> 36:26.061
instead of the county courthouse.

36:26.144 --> 36:29.314
However, anything that pertains to the events of the evening...

36:29.606 --> 36:31.608
must be a matter of public knowledge.

36:32.359 --> 36:34.111
What was Mr. Graham's statement?

36:34.736 --> 36:37.364
Well, his exact words were:

36:37.573 --> 36:39.491
"It wasn't an accident.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.994
"She did it deliberately."

36:42.536 --> 36:44.163
Is that correct?

36:46.373 --> 36:48.625
Any more questions, Mr. District Attorney?

36:48.709 --> 36:51.336
- Not at all.
- That's all, Lieutenant.

36:52.546 --> 36:55.382
Mr. Coroner, before you conclude this hearing...

36:55.465 --> 36:57.593
I'd like to recall Dr. Sherman to the stand.

36:57.676 --> 36:59.887
Dr. Sherman, will you take the stand, please?

37:04.600 --> 37:08.520
Unless I'm mistaken, this is your personal diagnosis of Mrs. Graham's illness?

37:08.604 --> 37:09.646
Yes.

37:09.730 --> 37:13.442
Dr. Sherman, according to the case history you've already given the coroner...

37:13.525 --> 37:15.819
Mrs. Graham was an invalid, and likely to remain so.

37:15.903 --> 37:18.071
- Yes.
- Was she depressed?

37:19.406 --> 37:20.449
Well...

37:22.242 --> 37:25.454
- Was Mrs. Graham depressed?
- Yes.

37:25.871 --> 37:27.331
In your opinion, Doctor...

37:27.414 --> 37:30.250
was she depressed enough to commit suicide?

37:31.168 --> 37:34.379
If you'll excuse me, sir, Mr. Graham's children have just come in.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.216
- Daddy.
- Wynn, my boy.

37:37.799 --> 37:40.219
I didn't know you were here. Come on out in the hall.

37:40.260 --> 37:43.722
Carol, darling, I didn't expect you so soon. You shouldn't be in here.

37:44.431 --> 37:47.601
Why are all the people in there? Where's Mother?

37:48.018 --> 37:52.397
Wynn, please run along up to your room. Carol will be up in a few minutes.

37:52.689 --> 37:54.858
- All right, Daddy.
- That's a good boy.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.278
- You didn't tell him, did you?
- No.

37:59.279 --> 38:01.865
It's awful you had to come home at a time like this.

38:01.949 --> 38:04.493
When I phoned I didn't intend you to bring Wynn.

38:06.078 --> 38:09.706
He said suicide. Why? I thought it was an accident.

38:10.082 --> 38:12.876
I know suicide was mentioned, but this is an inquest.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.462
They have to consider everything, every possibility.

38:15.546 --> 38:17.589
But why should they talk about suicide?

38:17.673 --> 38:20.092
Was Mother unhappy enough to kill herself?

38:20.425 --> 38:23.303
You know your mother was unhappy. It was part of her illness.

38:23.387 --> 38:25.514
- But, Father...
- Don't let's talk about it now.

38:25.597 --> 38:27.516
I'm in the middle of this, please help me.

38:27.599 --> 38:31.061
Go to your room and in a little while I'll come up and we'll have a talk.

38:31.144 --> 38:32.938
Will you do this for me, darling?

38:33.772 --> 38:35.107
Oh, Daddy!

38:35.983 --> 38:37.609
I know, darling.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.655
Mr. Graham.

38:42.656 --> 38:44.825
The coroner wants to see you.

39:26.575 --> 39:28.494
Is that you, Miss Howell?

39:30.120 --> 39:31.997
Miss Howell, is that you?

39:55.437 --> 39:58.482
Miss Graham, I thought I heard somebody call me.

39:58.732 --> 40:01.360
Yes, I did. Is it over?

40:03.403 --> 40:05.030
The inquest? Yes.

40:05.239 --> 40:07.950
- What was the verdict?
- Accidental death.

40:08.992 --> 40:13.372
- It wasn't an accident, I know better.
- You shouldn't think such things, really.

40:13.413 --> 40:16.083
Miss Howell, my mother mentioned you in her letters.

40:16.166 --> 40:19.670
I know quite a lot about you, probably more than you'd want me to.

40:19.753 --> 40:21.588
What could she possibly say about me?

40:21.713 --> 40:24.132
The last letter was written just before the accident.

40:24.216 --> 40:27.135
It was mostly about my father, but she mentioned you.

40:27.219 --> 40:30.013
How attractive you were to him. How much he liked you.

40:30.097 --> 40:32.891
I know your mother thought that, but it's not true.

40:32.975 --> 40:36.144
- My mother never lied to me.
- It isn't a question of lying or not.

40:36.228 --> 40:38.939
Your mother was very ill, much more than you were ever told.

40:39.022 --> 40:42.776
- That made her imagine all kinds of things.
- There's no point in discussing it.

40:42.860 --> 40:44.361
It's over now.

40:45.028 --> 40:46.905
I'm home, you're leaving.

40:46.947 --> 40:50.242
But your father has asked me to stay and take care of Wynn.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.745
I don't want you here, is that plain enough?

40:54.163 --> 40:56.081
Yes, that's very plain.

40:56.915 --> 41:01.086
If you're trying to discharge me, don't you think you should ask your father about it?

41:01.128 --> 41:02.921
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

41:02.963 --> 41:04.965
You're very confident of what he would say.

41:05.048 --> 41:07.301
- You're being a very silly girl.
- Am I?

41:07.634 --> 41:11.430
I know how much my father likes you, too much to let you go.

41:11.471 --> 41:12.639
You've planned it that way.

41:12.723 --> 41:15.058
That's so ridiculous I won't even bother to deny it.

41:15.142 --> 41:17.394
There are things about your mother you should know.

41:17.477 --> 41:19.146
Don't talk about my mother.

41:19.271 --> 41:22.107
No matter how hard you scheme, you'll never take her place.

41:22.191 --> 41:23.942
I won't let you, Miss Howell.

41:24.026 --> 41:26.904
If it hadn't been for you, my mother would still be alive.

41:26.987 --> 41:29.031
She killed herself because of you.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.073
Carol.

41:30.324 --> 41:32.826
I think you owe Miss Howell an apology.

41:33.368 --> 41:35.746
You've made an extremely offensive suggestion.

41:35.829 --> 41:38.123
- You will apologize.
- No, please don't, Mr. Graham.

41:38.165 --> 41:40.292
Both my children have been taught good manners.

41:40.334 --> 41:42.127
I prefer they don't forget them.

41:42.878 --> 41:46.423
Carol, things haven't been pleasant here for some time.

41:46.507 --> 41:48.550
I'd looked forward to your coming home.

41:48.634 --> 41:52.221
I hoped you'd make things easier for all of us. Please don't disappoint me.

41:52.513 --> 41:56.391
You don't need me, Father. Miss Howell has taken my place.

41:56.934 --> 41:58.936
Just as she took Mother's place.

41:59.686 --> 42:00.729
Oh, no.

42:00.812 --> 42:03.232
In the circumstances, you'd better go back to school.

42:03.315 --> 42:04.274
Yes, Father.

42:04.358 --> 42:06.026
Mr. Graham, it isn't her fault.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.028
I don't want you to defend me, Miss Howell.

42:08.111 --> 42:11.406
As long as you're in my father's house, I'd rather be somewhere else.

42:11.573 --> 42:13.242
Carol, your father needs you.

42:15.285 --> 42:18.205
- I wish this hadn't happened.
- So do I.

42:28.048 --> 42:30.259
Frightened you today, did it?

42:30.843 --> 42:33.345
You remember, the medicine made you feel better.

42:35.639 --> 42:36.974
Beginning to feel it?

42:39.309 --> 42:40.519
That's fine.

42:43.230 --> 42:46.650
Yesterday, you told me about Mrs. Graham dying.

42:47.401 --> 42:48.944
What happened after that?

42:50.654 --> 42:52.030
Washington.

42:52.322 --> 42:56.034
Yes, you went there with Mr. Graham and his son, Wynn, I gather.

42:56.243 --> 42:59.746
Something happened there that upset you very much. Made you ill.

43:00.873 --> 43:01.915
Yes.

43:02.708 --> 43:06.003
Made me ill, like I am now.

43:06.587 --> 43:08.422
You don't forget things like that.

43:09.423 --> 43:11.383
Now, why don't you tell me about it.

43:13.177 --> 43:16.221
After the funeral, we moved back to Washington.

43:17.347 --> 43:18.599
I didn't want to.

43:19.474 --> 43:20.976
I wasn't really needed.

43:21.852 --> 43:23.604
Mr. Graham asked me to.

43:24.938 --> 43:26.523
And I thought...

43:28.108 --> 43:31.528
I knew I'd never see David again if I went away.

43:32.779 --> 43:35.657
So I stayed in Washington, with the Grahams...

43:36.617 --> 43:38.785
<i>taking care of Wynn.</i>

43:39.453 --> 43:41.163
<i>Months went by.</i>

43:41.955 --> 43:44.458
I'll race you to the top of the stairs.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.919
- I'll beat you there.
- Come on.

43:48.212 --> 43:49.505
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

43:49.588 --> 43:52.174
- Ready, set...
- Wynn, is that you?

43:52.257 --> 43:53.217
Daddy's home!

43:54.051 --> 43:55.469
Hello, Son.

43:55.636 --> 43:58.305
Daddy, I raced Miss Howell to the door and I won.

43:58.388 --> 44:01.141
Good for you. Wynn, this is an old friend of mine...

44:01.683 --> 44:02.726
Mr. Sutton.

44:02.809 --> 44:04.937
- How do you do?
- Glad to see you again, Wynn.

44:04.978 --> 44:07.481
The last time I saw you, you weren't shaving yet.

44:09.191 --> 44:12.694
It's mathematically impossible to try a joke on a child this age.

44:12.820 --> 44:14.530
I don't remember you.

44:14.738 --> 44:18.575
I'm sorry to hear that, I always try to leave a lasting impression.

44:18.742 --> 44:19.785
What are these?

44:19.910 --> 44:23.205
Those are the plans of a cracking plant Mr. Sutton's building for me.

44:23.288 --> 44:26.041
- You remember, you saw one once.
- Yes.

44:26.124 --> 44:27.584
Miss Howell, come in.

44:28.043 --> 44:30.379
- I hope we're not disturbing you.
- Not at all.

44:30.462 --> 44:32.840
I brought my homework and David Sutton.

44:32.923 --> 44:34.591
Hello, David, how are you?

44:35.050 --> 44:38.512
No use lying to you, Louise, you're a nurse. I'm fine.

44:38.679 --> 44:40.222
- You?
- I'm fine, too.

44:40.305 --> 44:44.309
- Good. Dean, you?
- Not a complaint. Not a symptom.

44:44.393 --> 44:47.437
This is absolutely the healthiest circle I've ever moved in.

44:47.563 --> 44:50.023
I keep forgetting that you two know each other.

44:50.149 --> 44:52.484
Oh, yes, David and I are very old friends.

44:52.609 --> 44:55.445
- If you're talking business, I'Il...
- No, we're all finished.

44:55.529 --> 44:57.823
As a matter of fact, I was about to propose a drink.

44:57.906 --> 45:00.576
- Second the motion.
- Would you join us?

45:00.951 --> 45:03.328
No, thank you. I don't think Wynn would approve.

45:03.370 --> 45:04.580
But I'll mix them for you.

45:04.663 --> 45:07.207
Wynn, go upstairs and get ready for dinner.

45:07.291 --> 45:08.458
Yes, Miss Howell.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.712
Daddy, you promised me you'd read me a story.

45:11.795 --> 45:14.173
- Whenever you're ready.
- All right, I'm ready.

45:15.007 --> 45:18.051
Dean, I have your okay to go ahead with this pumping station?

45:18.135 --> 45:19.636
Yes. All right.

45:20.137 --> 45:22.306
You're the only man who ever worked for me...

45:22.389 --> 45:25.976
who could get me to do what he wanted and make it seem like a favor to me.

45:33.066 --> 45:36.737
David, you take water in yours, if I remember correctly?

45:36.904 --> 45:37.988
Yes, please.

45:38.071 --> 45:40.365
I ran a 1,000 barrels of heavy crude...

45:41.700 --> 45:45.662
- The lighter stuff will go faster.
- I don't know, it's cold ground.

45:45.746 --> 45:48.207
That oil comes up as stiff as an evening shirt.

45:48.248 --> 45:49.875
We'll do what we can with it.

45:50.125 --> 45:52.920
- Was there much deposit in the test load?
- Here you are.

45:53.003 --> 45:54.087
- Oh, thanks.
- Good.

45:54.171 --> 45:57.716
Jackson put a go-devil through with it, there was hardly any sludge at all.

45:57.799 --> 46:00.177
Here's to oil, down with atomic energy.

46:00.302 --> 46:03.138
Beginning to think the atom was opened by mistake.

46:03.222 --> 46:04.932
Are you going to be here long?

46:05.557 --> 46:08.268
A few weeks, perhaps a month. Depends on the boss.

46:08.352 --> 46:11.230
You'd only be here a day, if I have anything to say about it.

46:11.438 --> 46:15.400
- You've been away, haven't you?
- Yes, up and away. Canada.

46:16.109 --> 46:18.445
Really? I didn't know.

46:19.780 --> 46:21.114
Did you like Canada?

46:21.448 --> 46:25.077
Canadians are wonderful people. It's just that they're spread so far apart...

46:25.160 --> 46:26.411
at least where I was.

46:26.954 --> 46:29.998
This is my first taste of civilization in a long time.

46:30.582 --> 46:31.750
I think it'll last.

46:32.125 --> 46:35.838
- You sound as though it were Ionely.
- I was too busy to be Ionely.

46:35.921 --> 46:38.465
I warned you to work with me, you wouldn't like it much.

46:38.549 --> 46:40.092
Mr. Graham, Wynn is ready.

46:40.175 --> 46:42.094
He said you promised to read him Bugs Bunny.

46:42.135 --> 46:43.887
So I did, excuse me.

46:47.057 --> 46:49.059
Don't spread this around the office...

46:49.142 --> 46:52.187
but, my son's affection for me is based on my ability to say...

46:52.271 --> 46:53.647
"What's cooking, doc?"

46:53.730 --> 46:54.940
I'll be back in a minute.

46:58.068 --> 47:01.905
I never realized before that Canada is so large and far away.

47:04.199 --> 47:08.120
- David, it's wonderful to see you again.
- Canadian Special, good.

47:08.745 --> 47:11.999
Of course, in Canada they won't drink anything but Kentucky whiskey.

47:12.791 --> 47:14.501
Aren't you going to kiss me?

47:14.960 --> 47:17.212
I had no plans one way or the other.

47:17.337 --> 47:20.257
All right, go ahead and kiss me. You don't have to mean it.

47:25.846 --> 47:28.015
I didn't expect you to mean it that little.

47:28.348 --> 47:31.268
When a woman kisses me, Louise, she has to take pot luck.

47:32.227 --> 47:35.981
I can see that you weren't nearly as Ionely in Canada as you pretended to be.

47:36.106 --> 47:39.359
No, I wasn't. Man, Louise, doesn't live by bread alone.

47:40.944 --> 47:44.323
- Very amusing.
- No. Only mildly so.

47:46.408 --> 47:49.369
You've changed, David. Something's changed you.

47:49.745 --> 47:52.998
No, we were through before I went to Canada.

47:53.457 --> 47:57.211
- I suppose I should've put that in writing.
- But, now you're hard and bitter.

47:57.461 --> 48:01.507
Bored, I think would be a bit closer to it. I warned you about that, didn't I?

48:01.590 --> 48:04.176
Look, suppose we don't discuss it anymore?

48:05.260 --> 48:07.763
All right. Let's discuss something else.

48:08.055 --> 48:11.892
Slide rules, cracking plants? Or maybe, you'd rather talk about the weather?

48:11.975 --> 48:14.561
It's been very nice, the weather. We have so much of it.

48:14.645 --> 48:17.815
Washington is practically all weather. Some hot, some cold.

48:17.898 --> 48:20.859
- In between, we have rain. Shall I go on?
- Please do.

48:20.901 --> 48:23.320
In a moment I'll be out on the street, hailing a cab.

48:23.403 --> 48:26.824
I hope I haven't said anything offensive, I wouldn't want to hurt you.

48:26.907 --> 48:30.244
Usually, one of the nice things about going away, is coming back.

48:30.702 --> 48:32.412
Usually, not always.

48:33.038 --> 48:37.000
Did you expect to come back and find me just as you left me, waiting patiently?

48:37.084 --> 48:39.253
Crying a little with the joy of seeing you again?

48:39.336 --> 48:43.131
You're so sure of yourself, so certain of your own breathless charm!

48:43.215 --> 48:44.675
I'm sorry, Louise.

48:45.384 --> 48:48.262
You watch temperatures go down and then go up again...

48:48.679 --> 48:50.514
but in love, there are no relapses.

48:51.139 --> 48:55.227
Once you're out of it, the fever never comes back again. Bye, Louise.

48:55.310 --> 48:58.188
Your love affair with yourself has reached heroic proportions.

48:58.272 --> 48:59.731
Doesn't leave much room for me.

48:59.815 --> 49:03.402
Are you sure you can get along without somebody to help you admire yourself?

49:03.485 --> 49:06.488
You're offering me no more than any other registered nurse.

49:07.990 --> 49:10.075
Louise, be reasonable.

49:13.537 --> 49:15.330
That's fairly reasonable.

49:20.002 --> 49:21.837
David, leaving already?

49:21.920 --> 49:24.715
Yes, I have a dinner date. You know how it is.

49:24.798 --> 49:26.800
Don't come in with a hangover tomorrow.

49:28.844 --> 49:30.512
Don't go, Miss Howell.

49:31.305 --> 49:33.390
I was just going out to get some fresh air.

49:42.399 --> 49:45.319
Sutton's a good fellow. I'm glad I've got him.

49:46.361 --> 49:47.905
He's doing very well.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.782
This is my last day here, Mr. Graham. I'm leaving.

49:52.117 --> 49:53.452
I don't understand.

49:53.577 --> 49:55.913
- It's simple. I'm quitting.
- Are you unhappy here?

49:55.996 --> 49:57.331
I'd rather not discuss it.

49:57.456 --> 49:59.541
- I won't permit it.
- I'm afraid you'll have to.

49:59.625 --> 50:02.085
I know people usually do what you want, Mr. Graham...

50:02.169 --> 50:04.296
if they won't, you have ways of persuading them.

50:04.338 --> 50:06.590
But don't try that with me, because it won't work.

50:06.673 --> 50:08.634
I've never seen you like this before.

50:09.009 --> 50:12.387
- You're usually so quiet.
- Yes, quiet, patient, efficient Miss Howell.

50:12.471 --> 50:15.933
Tell her to do something and she does it, day after day, year after year.

50:16.016 --> 50:20.145
At the age of 60, retires with a gold watch and the blessings of the entire household.

50:20.229 --> 50:22.523
No, thank you. I've had enough of being a servant.

50:22.606 --> 50:25.067
I've never thought of you as a servant. I've never...

50:25.150 --> 50:28.028
- You've been very kind, but I'm leaving.
- Don't go, please.

50:28.111 --> 50:32.115
Something's upset you. I don't know what it is, but I'm deeply concerned.

50:33.033 --> 50:36.036
You're right, I do try to get what I want whenever possible.

50:36.620 --> 50:38.747
That may seem selfish, I suppose it is.

50:39.748 --> 50:41.875
But you've become very necessary here.

50:42.209 --> 50:45.712
You're a part of my home. Very much a part of my life.

50:47.172 --> 50:49.383
I don't know how to express this properly...

50:51.051 --> 50:52.845
but I've become very fond of you.

50:53.345 --> 50:55.013
Fond is an understatement.

50:55.055 --> 50:58.225
- Mr. Graham, don't...
- I hadn't meant to talk of this for a while...

50:58.308 --> 50:59.810
but now it seems necessary.

51:00.727 --> 51:02.312
I'm asking you to marry me.

51:07.651 --> 51:09.319
I hadn't intended to amuse you.

51:11.280 --> 51:15.325
It wasn't you. It was something else, please believe me.

51:15.909 --> 51:17.828
I had to either laugh or cry.

51:19.079 --> 51:21.540
I'm through with crying, don't you understand that?

51:21.623 --> 51:23.792
No, but it's all right.

51:24.418 --> 51:26.128
As for marrying you...

51:27.045 --> 51:28.380
it's very flattering.

51:28.422 --> 51:30.465
It feels wonderful to be wanted by someone.

51:30.549 --> 51:33.427
I needed that feeling right now, more than you'll ever know.

51:33.844 --> 51:36.346
Something happens to a woman when she isn't wanted.

51:37.014 --> 51:40.225
- Something dreadful.
- All of which doesn't answer my question.

51:40.767 --> 51:42.019
Will you marry me?

51:43.061 --> 51:44.354
I'm aging visibly.

51:46.106 --> 51:47.649
I'm not in love with you.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.860
Do you think we could be happy?

51:50.110 --> 51:52.654
I'll do everything in my power to see that you are.

51:53.864 --> 51:56.158
There's Carol to think of. She doesn't like me.

51:56.241 --> 51:58.744
I haven't done this very gracefully or even adequately.

51:58.827 --> 52:02.414
But, one thing is certain, Carol isn't asking to marry you, I am.

52:03.832 --> 52:05.459
I've never had a great deal.

52:06.293 --> 52:09.796
It's very tempting to be offered the kind of life I'd have as your wife.

52:09.963 --> 52:11.298
But that's not important.

52:12.132 --> 52:14.760
The important thing is I think I can make you happy.

52:16.803 --> 52:18.764
I will marry you, if you want me to.

52:23.352 --> 52:26.855
I'm sorry, I'm just not quite used to the idea, yet.

52:27.481 --> 52:31.068
It isn't very easy for a man my age to kiss a woman with dignity.

52:31.527 --> 52:32.778
I'll need practice.

52:37.366 --> 52:39.535
Will you have dinner with me, Louise?

52:40.452 --> 52:41.787
Yes, Dean.

52:51.088 --> 52:53.632
Don't you love the way Prof. Hopkins gets mad?

52:53.715 --> 52:55.926
- I just think he's delicious, don't you?
- Well...

52:56.051 --> 52:59.096
- Do you like Mr. Elliott?
- Sort of.

52:59.179 --> 53:01.265
I can't stand him. Know what he said to me?

53:01.348 --> 53:03.559
You'll never believe it. He said I talk too much.

53:03.642 --> 53:04.977
I wonder where he got that idea.

53:05.018 --> 53:06.812
Hey, Graham, you have a visitor.

53:06.854 --> 53:08.147
- A man?
- No, a lady.

53:08.230 --> 53:09.565
- Thank you.
- Bye.

53:20.367 --> 53:22.536
- Hello.
- Yes?

53:22.995 --> 53:25.164
I came to see you.

53:25.706 --> 53:27.040
Obviously.

53:28.417 --> 53:30.544
That's a very pretty sweater you have on.

53:30.627 --> 53:33.755
You didn't drive 300 miles just to admire my sweater.

53:34.256 --> 53:35.507
No, I didn't.

53:36.216 --> 53:37.801
I came to tell you something.

53:40.846 --> 53:43.765
Father called me. You're going to be married.

53:45.350 --> 53:47.519
I'm sorry he told you. I wanted to.

53:47.853 --> 53:49.271
Is that all?

53:49.897 --> 53:51.231
I want you to like me.

53:51.315 --> 53:54.151
I don't think that's absolutely necessary, Miss Howell.

53:54.610 --> 53:57.154
I hope you won't mind if I don't call you mother.

53:57.571 --> 53:59.239
That's beside the point.

53:59.448 --> 54:02.576
I do think that we should talk about your mother, just a little.

54:02.784 --> 54:04.536
I know what you're going to say.

54:04.661 --> 54:07.664
I talked to Dr. Sherman. He told me things I hadn't known.

54:08.582 --> 54:11.293
I know what I thought about you and Father wasn't true.

54:11.376 --> 54:14.004
And I'm sorry I said the things I did. I'm very sorry.

54:14.087 --> 54:15.589
It's all right. I didn't blame you.

54:15.672 --> 54:16.882
As for your getting married...

54:16.965 --> 54:20.093
you and Father are quite capable of deciding things for yourself.

54:20.177 --> 54:22.971
- It isn't necessary to have my approval.
- Oh, but it is.

54:23.055 --> 54:24.848
Your father is very Ionely, Carol.

54:25.474 --> 54:29.019
Maybe that has something to do with his wanting to marry me, I don't know.

54:29.144 --> 54:32.439
I do know that I can't marry him, if it would mean his losing you.

54:33.190 --> 54:36.527
Since there's no hope you'll like me, I'll do what you want me to do.

54:37.069 --> 54:38.529
I'll go away.

54:39.029 --> 54:41.907
- He'd never forgive me.
- He won't know I've talked to you.

54:42.199 --> 54:43.784
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

54:43.951 --> 54:46.703
You can't help the way you feel, any more than I can.

54:46.870 --> 54:50.040
Your father needs someone, Carol, and he has for a long time.

54:50.374 --> 54:54.211
You've stayed away all these weeks just to punish him for making you unhappy.

54:54.795 --> 54:56.880
You don't know the meaning of unhappiness.

54:56.964 --> 54:59.466
If you ever really want to know, ask your father.

55:02.970 --> 55:05.430
You know, we could've been friends very easily.

55:05.764 --> 55:08.350
If we'd met a few days sooner, or a long time later.

55:08.725 --> 55:09.935
It's too bad.

55:11.478 --> 55:14.731
Miss Howell...

55:16.859 --> 55:18.068
Louise.

55:22.781 --> 55:25.117
- Good afternoon, Mr. Sutton.
- Good afternoon.

55:26.910 --> 55:28.120
How late am I?

55:28.162 --> 55:30.372
I'm afraid you've missed the entire ceremony.

55:30.455 --> 55:32.499
Frankly, I just came for the food and drink.

55:32.624 --> 55:33.667
Where are they?

55:33.750 --> 55:35.669
Mr. And Mrs. Graham are in the drawing room.

55:35.752 --> 55:39.173
I mean the food and drink. Never mind, I'll find them myself.

55:42.342 --> 55:44.469
- How are you, David?
- Hello, George.

55:55.355 --> 55:58.192
- I wish you both a lot of happiness.
- Thank you very much.

55:58.275 --> 56:01.653
I wonder if I'd start a new trend if I shook hands with the bride...

56:01.695 --> 56:02.779
and embraced the groom?

56:02.821 --> 56:05.657
I know it's tough, but couldn't you try to be conventional?

56:05.949 --> 56:07.659
You're a very lucky man.

56:07.826 --> 56:09.912
- You're a very lucky woman.
- Thank you, David.

56:09.995 --> 56:12.748
Bless you both, and where are the hors d'oeuvres?

56:13.624 --> 56:15.584
Dean, I didn't know you'd invited him.

56:15.667 --> 56:18.086
- I didn't. Didn't you?
- No.

56:34.686 --> 56:36.230
One more, please.

56:38.899 --> 56:41.527
Come out from behind that potted palm.

56:41.819 --> 56:43.070
No.

56:43.779 --> 56:46.698
Would you rather I hid and you came out and found me?

56:47.324 --> 56:50.994
I'll be through crying in a minute. Please go away.

56:51.078 --> 56:54.623
I will not. I'm hungry. You cry, I'll eat.

56:56.291 --> 56:58.335
Don't mind me. Blow as hard as you like.

57:01.463 --> 57:03.966
There's nothing unusual about crying at a wedding.

57:04.758 --> 57:07.386
Certainly not, I've got a lump in my throat myself.

57:07.886 --> 57:10.722
Mine's pure emotion. Yours is devilled egg.

57:11.056 --> 57:14.226
I was afraid you were going to ruin a perfectly good potted palm.

57:14.309 --> 57:15.769
It wouldn't matter.

57:16.103 --> 57:19.815
- They're not ours, they're rented.
- Don't worry about it.

57:22.651 --> 57:25.362
- What?
- You're David Sutton.

57:26.280 --> 57:28.240
I've never denied that, who are you?

57:29.032 --> 57:31.410
Don't you remember me? Don't you recognize me?

57:31.743 --> 57:33.954
Not with your eyes in that condition, no.

57:34.621 --> 57:37.791
The last time you saw me, my eyes were in exactly this condition.

57:37.875 --> 57:40.460
I was 11 years old and I'd just proposed marriage to you.

57:40.544 --> 57:41.920
Now, do you know?

57:42.087 --> 57:45.507
Not definitely. I received proposals from several 11-year-olds.

57:46.008 --> 57:47.050
Will this help?

57:47.342 --> 57:50.387
When you said no, I hauled off and kicked you in the shins.

57:51.138 --> 57:53.015
Carol Graham!

57:53.307 --> 57:56.768
I'm disappointed, I'd pictured you going through life with a limp.

57:57.144 --> 57:58.479
Let me look at you.

58:01.773 --> 58:04.401
Well, you haven't grown very much but...

58:05.152 --> 58:06.361
then again, you have.

58:07.321 --> 58:08.822
Let me look at you.

58:09.156 --> 58:12.993
You're holding your stomach in a bit, otherwise you've held together beautifully.

58:13.118 --> 58:14.953
- Yes, very attractive.
- Thank you.

58:15.037 --> 58:18.081
Why don't we see if the minister is still here? A double wedding.

58:18.165 --> 58:19.625
I don't want my shins kicked again.

58:19.708 --> 58:21.919
But, I won't be rushed into anything, either.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.629
I'm going to give you plenty of time.

58:23.712 --> 58:26.256
You're gonna take me dining, dancing, nightclubbing...

58:26.340 --> 58:28.091
That sounds like an expensive program.

58:28.175 --> 58:31.011
You better speak to your father about raising your allowance.

58:31.094 --> 58:32.763
Carol, your father wants you.

58:33.514 --> 58:35.265
I'll be right back.

58:38.519 --> 58:39.603
Wine?

58:39.937 --> 58:41.146
Please.

58:42.523 --> 58:43.482
Thank you.

58:44.107 --> 58:45.359
Stay away from Carol.

58:50.697 --> 58:53.116
- Why?
- Because you're not wanted in this house.

58:53.367 --> 58:55.494
I'm married now and I have a different life.

58:55.577 --> 58:58.121
Frankly, you bring back very unpleasant memories.

58:58.205 --> 59:00.624
I've forgiven you, why haven't you forgiven me?

59:00.707 --> 59:02.835
Do I have to make a scene before you leave?

59:03.502 --> 59:07.506
No, I arrived late, it's only right that I should leave early.

59:25.566 --> 59:27.192
- Hello, Louise.
- Hello, John.

59:27.276 --> 59:29.153
Where's Dean? Is he neglecting you already?

59:29.194 --> 59:32.072
- Yes. For a new oil field.
- That's hardly a good excuse.

59:47.045 --> 59:49.965
There's David Sutton.

59:55.596 --> 59:58.348
That's very rude. He'll think you're inviting him over here.

59:58.432 --> 59:59.516
I am.

01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:09.902
I've hooked him.

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:12.154
I wish you hadn't done that.

01:00:12.237 --> 01:00:13.697
I don't want him to join us.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.366
When he comes over, make an excuse, but get rid of him.

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.285
- Why?
- Because I asked you to.

01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:25.417
- Hello, Carol.
- Hello, David.

01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:28.045
- Mrs. Graham, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.422
We don't want to keep you from your friends.

01:00:30.464 --> 01:00:31.715
Yes, we do.

01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:34.551
As a matter of fact, I haven't a friend in the world.

01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:38.847
I guess, I better be getting back to my seat.

01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:40.474
Too late, you're trapped.

01:00:41.058 --> 01:00:43.435
In that case I'll take the best spot. Move over.

01:02:14.568 --> 01:02:17.237
Darling, I have a headache, I think I'd better go home.

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:18.489
Should I go with you?

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:21.283
No, you stay. I don't want to spoil the concert for you.

01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:23.243
I'll see her to the car.

01:02:25.287 --> 01:02:28.165
You're using the wrong tactics, you should keep me guessing.

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:29.875
I don't know why I don't hate you.

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:32.377
You don't try hard enough. You should force yourself.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:34.421
Someday you're going to stop laughing at me.

01:02:34.505 --> 01:02:37.132
- May I see you to the car?
- No, thank you. Don't bother.

01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:38.884
Good night, Mrs. Graham.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.935
Good evening, Mrs. Graham.

01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:50.687
Oh, Elsie.

01:02:51.772 --> 01:02:53.565
- Is my husband home?
- No, ma'am.

01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:56.652
He phoned from the office. He said he'd be late.

01:03:58.964 --> 01:04:00.090
What is it?

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:19.378
- We fooled her, didn't we?
- Yes.

01:05:22.381 --> 01:05:24.174
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.

01:05:24.258 --> 01:05:25.509
See you tomorrow.

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:52.911
Carol.

01:05:52.995 --> 01:05:54.830
- I thought you were ill.
- Never mind that.

01:05:54.913 --> 01:05:56.248
- I want to talk to you.
- About?

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:58.542
- Not here, in my room.
- We can talk here.

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:00.878
Get in there, I said.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.047
I don't like this kind of treatment.

01:06:05.465 --> 01:06:07.926
I saw you kissing.

01:06:08.218 --> 01:06:10.596
- What of it?
- I heard what you said to him.

01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:13.724
- Did you?
- Stay away from him, Carol. He's no good.

01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:16.226
Odd, he says that about you.

01:06:16.393 --> 01:06:18.228
We had quite a long talk about you.

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:20.898
- He's a liar, whatever he said was a lie.
- Really?

01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:23.942
Even what he told me about how you used to meet in his cabin?

01:06:24.026 --> 01:06:25.569
Lies, all lies.

01:06:25.903 --> 01:06:28.906
I'd never have anything to do with him, that's why he hates me.

01:06:29.156 --> 01:06:32.451
He doesn't hate you. But he doesn't love you, either.

01:06:33.202 --> 01:06:35.746
You're the one, you're in love with him, aren't you?

01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:39.750
That's absurd and ridiculous. Childish, just like everything else.

01:06:41.627 --> 01:06:45.797
- Pretty stupid of you to have believed him.
- He told me other things I hadn't known.

01:06:46.006 --> 01:06:47.257
About my mother.

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:49.343
What about her?

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.429
What about your mother, what did he say?

01:06:52.846 --> 01:06:54.765
You killed her, it wasn't an accident.

01:06:54.807 --> 01:06:57.309
- Keep quiet!
- You did it so you could marry my father.

01:06:57.392 --> 01:07:00.229
- So David would come back...
- That's not true, you're lying.

01:07:00.312 --> 01:07:01.563
You're all liars.

01:07:01.647 --> 01:07:04.858
You're in love with David, and you killed my mother to get him back!

01:07:04.942 --> 01:07:07.444
It's true, isn't it? Isn't it true, Louise?

01:07:07.653 --> 01:07:10.405
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's true!

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:12.991
Now leave me alone.

01:07:16.328 --> 01:07:20.082
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to tell my father, right now.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.460
Don't do that, Carol, I'm warning you.

01:07:25.212 --> 01:07:26.213
Carol!

01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:38.976
I won't let you tell him.

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:40.644
- You can't stop me.
- Yes, I can.

01:07:40.686 --> 01:07:42.479
Let me go, I'm going to tell him.

01:07:56.702 --> 01:07:57.703
Good night.

01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:40.162
Louise, you shouldn't have waited up. Are you feeling better?

01:08:40.953 --> 01:08:43.457
- Yes.
- I came straight home as I was worried.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.459
It's a shame you missed the concert.

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:48.295
- Your jacket is wet.
- It doesn't matter.

01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:51.423
- Is there something I can do for you?
- No.

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:53.091
Good night.

01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:21.787
142 over 90.

01:09:22.621 --> 01:09:23.997
All right...

01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:27.000
you can finish dressing now, Mrs...

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:28.460
Mrs. Smith.

01:09:28.544 --> 01:09:30.462
Oh, yes. Smith.

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:33.173
Unusual name.

01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:36.051
Come in here, when you're ready.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.474
Who did she say recommended her?

01:09:42.558 --> 01:09:44.643
Dr. Reynolds in Washington. Shall I look him up?

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:46.687
Don't bother, I doubt there is such a doctor.

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:49.648
In any case, it doesn't matter. I know all that I need to know.

01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:51.649
Did she mention any previous medical history?

01:09:51.733 --> 01:09:55.112
Measles, influenza, the usual things. No serious illnesses.

01:09:55.154 --> 01:09:57.197
Perhaps that much is true.

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:00.951
Sit down, please.

01:10:08.208 --> 01:10:10.961
- You think I've been lying to you?
- I'm sure of it.

01:10:11.628 --> 01:10:15.340
People named Smith rarely have the letters "L.G." on their clothing.

01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:17.968
- I'm sorry.
- That's not important.

01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:20.888
It merely makes it a little more difficult for me to help you.

01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:23.515
And you do need help. Take this.

01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:31.940
Incoordination. Now close your eyes, please.

01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:35.694
Hold out your hand.

01:10:37.613 --> 01:10:39.323
What does that feel like to you?

01:10:39.698 --> 01:10:41.033
A piece of cloth.

01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:43.160
Now the other hand.

01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:46.246
That doesn't feel like a piece of cloth, does it?

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.166
- No, it doesn't.
- What does it feel like?

01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:52.544
I don't know.

01:10:53.045 --> 01:10:55.047
A piece of sandpaper, perhaps?

01:10:55.839 --> 01:10:57.966
Yes, that's it.

01:10:58.133 --> 01:10:59.551
Open your eyes.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.056
Extreme suggestibility.

01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:07.392
And that pounding noise you hear at night...

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:10.062
that's easily explained, Mrs. Smith.

01:11:16.401 --> 01:11:18.946
It's merely the sound of your own heart beating.

01:11:19.071 --> 01:11:21.365
Blood pulsation can be heard as sound.

01:11:21.907 --> 01:11:24.076
It's a common symptom of neurasthenia.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.286
What's wrong with me, Doctor?

01:11:27.079 --> 01:11:28.956
Why do I see things that aren't...

01:11:29.456 --> 01:11:30.916
that just couldn't be real?

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:35.838
Sometimes a patient can't distinguish between reality and unreality.

01:11:36.171 --> 01:11:38.966
In your case, you're still able to make that distinction.

01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:40.884
But what if it gets worse? What then?

01:11:40.926 --> 01:11:44.054
There is a type of nervous disorder in which that happens.

01:11:44.138 --> 01:11:47.599
We all have dreams, Mrs. Smith. Bad dreams, sometimes.

01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:51.061
But we wake up and we say that was a bad dream.

01:11:51.186 --> 01:11:54.314
Occasionally, however, we find a patient who can't wake up.

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:56.441
He or she lacks insight...

01:11:56.525 --> 01:11:59.987
the ability to distinguish between what is real and what isn't.

01:12:00.445 --> 01:12:02.573
Now, that may be true in your case.

01:12:03.157 --> 01:12:05.117
It's too early to know definitely.

01:12:07.452 --> 01:12:09.788
You're describing schizophrenia, aren't you?

01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:11.915
Is that what's wrong with me?

01:12:12.082 --> 01:12:14.585
I didn't know you had any knowledge of the subject...

01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:16.753
or I shouldn't have discussed it.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.883
I knew there was something wrong with me when I came up here.

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:26.054
I had no idea it was insanity.

01:12:26.513 --> 01:12:29.141
Insanity's not a word we like to use, Mrs. Smith.

01:12:29.308 --> 01:12:31.685
You have a problem but it's not insoluble.

01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:33.020
Problems never are.

01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:35.981
Whatever it is that's troubling you, put an end to it.

01:12:36.815 --> 01:12:38.192
No, it's too late.

01:12:39.067 --> 01:12:40.986
- Much too late.
- Nonsense.

01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:43.697
The important thing is to know that there is something wrong.

01:12:44.031 --> 01:12:46.450
Now that you know, you can do something about it.

01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:49.286
I'm going to give you the name of a psychiatrist.

01:12:49.578 --> 01:12:50.787
Go and see him.

01:12:50.996 --> 01:12:54.416
Don't lie to him as you did to me. Tell him the truth.

01:12:56.418 --> 01:12:57.419
Mrs. Smith?

01:13:01.757 --> 01:13:03.592
Well, I'll have to come up then.

01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:06.512
I'll fly at the end of the week.

01:13:06.804 --> 01:13:08.222
Very well. See you then.

01:13:09.848 --> 01:13:11.558
Darling, I have to go to Canada.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.645
Just for a few days. Why don't you sit down?

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.527
I've got an idea. Why don't you come with me? Make it a holiday.

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:23.028
Might get some fishing in.

01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:25.280
I'll teach you how to get a 40-pound salmon.

01:13:25.364 --> 01:13:26.490
I'm leaving you.

01:13:27.032 --> 01:13:29.618
I'm going away. I don't know where. That isn't important.

01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:32.079
- The important thing is, I want a divorce.
- I don't...

01:13:32.162 --> 01:13:34.498
I won't discuss it. There's nothing to discuss.

01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:36.750
You don't know what you're saying.

01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:39.461
Why should you want a divorce? What have I done?

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:42.881
I thought I'd given you everything you wanted.

01:13:43.048 --> 01:13:46.385
I hoped that you'd be happy with me. I thought you were.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.511
It isn't you.

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:49.930
Whatever's wrong with our marriage is my fault.

01:13:50.139 --> 01:13:51.765
Louise, what's troubling you?

01:13:54.143 --> 01:13:55.394
I don't know exactly.

01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:58.313
But it just won't work out.

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:01.775
I can't take her place. I've tried but...

01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.361
- she hates me for it.
- Who hates you?

01:14:05.362 --> 01:14:06.613
- Pauline.
- Pauline?

01:14:07.156 --> 01:14:08.157
Yes.

01:14:09.408 --> 01:14:10.909
I can't seem to forget her.

01:14:11.243 --> 01:14:13.787
- Don't you see, I've got to go away.
- Stop it.

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:17.040
You talk as if she were alive.

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.420
Yes, I did, didn't I? I didn't mean to.

01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:24.339
She isn't alive, I know that.

01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:27.259
I'm sorry, we've never discussed Pauline before.

01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:29.261
But whatever problems I had...

01:14:29.678 --> 01:14:31.180
all the unpleasant memories...

01:14:31.305 --> 01:14:34.266
I put them aside when we were married. They were over for me.

01:14:34.933 --> 01:14:36.268
Not for you, I gather.

01:14:36.768 --> 01:14:38.145
Well, I'll fix that.

01:14:40.439 --> 01:14:42.483
I don't intend to lose you so easily.

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:45.861
Have my car brought around to the side entrance.

01:14:45.944 --> 01:14:48.572
Telephone the house and tell Elsie to pack some things...

01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:51.116
for Mrs. Graham and myself. We'll be out till Monday.

01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:52.743
Yes, sir. Where can we reach you?

01:14:52.826 --> 01:14:54.828
- I don't want to be reached.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:01.835
I love you very much.

01:15:02.461 --> 01:15:04.505
Your happiness means everything to me.

01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:07.549
I'm going to help you forget Pauline just as I've forgotten.

01:15:08.258 --> 01:15:09.635
You're going away with me.

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:11.678
- Where?
- To the lake house.

01:15:11.762 --> 01:15:14.014
Oh, no, I'm afraid of her!

01:15:14.598 --> 01:15:17.601
Pauline is gone from our lives. She can't harm us...

01:15:18.018 --> 01:15:19.520
or take you away from me.

01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:21.355
You'll see.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.107
There's only one way to solve a problem.

01:15:24.483 --> 01:15:25.901
And that's to face it.

01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:37.037
Good evening, Mrs. Graham.

01:15:38.914 --> 01:15:39.957
Mr. Graham.

01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:41.416
Good evening, Norris.

01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.293
Dreadful weather.

01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:45.629
- The place looks in good order.
- Thanks.

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:48.090
Almost thought we'd lose the house a while back.

01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:49.299
What happened?

01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:51.176
- Fire.
- Much damage?

01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:54.346
Burned quite a few trees. I want to talk to you about that...

01:15:54.429 --> 01:15:57.182
they'll blow down this winter anyway. My advice, cut them.

01:15:57.266 --> 01:15:58.934
You think any of them can be saved?

01:15:59.017 --> 01:16:01.228
Pretty bad shape. Would you like to look...

01:16:01.311 --> 01:16:03.480
before it gets dark? You can see from over here.

01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:05.858
- Go ahead, darling.
- All right.

01:18:01.306 --> 01:18:02.933
Good evening, Mrs. Graham.

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:09.189
- You're the caretaker's wife.
- I'm Mrs. Norris.

01:18:09.565 --> 01:18:12.776
I saw you come in from upstairs. I was airing out the rooms.

01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:14.987
I'm sorry we didn't know you were coming sooner.

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.072
I'd have fixed the place up a little.

01:18:17.447 --> 01:18:20.450
- That's quite all right.
- Mr. Norris was sick last week.

01:18:20.576 --> 01:18:22.369
That's why everything is so dusty.

01:18:22.578 --> 01:18:25.080
You'd be surprised how a place can run down so fast.

01:18:25.164 --> 01:18:27.207
It doesn't seem to take any time at all.

01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:28.292
Yes, I know.

01:18:28.584 --> 01:18:31.295
You look cold. I'll go and make you a cup of tea.

01:18:31.378 --> 01:18:32.754
No. Please don't bother.

01:18:32.838 --> 01:18:35.674
No bother. You stay by the fire. It won't take me a minute.

01:18:37.301 --> 01:18:39.178
Getting on to winter again.

01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:58.734
What is it!

01:21:13.624 --> 01:21:14.625
No.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.126
No, I won't.

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:17.794
I won't.

01:21:18.962 --> 01:21:20.422
Louise, what is it?

01:21:21.882 --> 01:21:23.133
Why did you scream?

01:21:23.634 --> 01:21:24.635
It's Pauline.

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:27.387
She wants me to kill myself, like she did.

01:21:27.763 --> 01:21:29.681
She wants me to drown, but I won't.

01:21:30.641 --> 01:21:31.725
Pauline is dead.

01:21:32.226 --> 01:21:34.895
- She's been dead over a year.
- No, she's there.

01:21:35.562 --> 01:21:37.314
Now, she's talking to me again.

01:21:37.564 --> 01:21:40.025
Hear her? Listen.

01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:43.195
"Kill yourself, Louise.

01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:45.823
"Drown yourself in the lake."

01:21:46.365 --> 01:21:47.449
Make her stop.

01:21:49.326 --> 01:21:52.371
I tell you, she's dead. There's no one there.

01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:58.585
Look, there's no one there.

01:22:03.382 --> 01:22:04.383
Gone?

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:14.768
She's gone.

01:22:15.769 --> 01:22:17.062
She was never there.

01:22:19.398 --> 01:22:20.858
She went back to the lake.

01:22:21.441 --> 01:22:22.943
She'll wait for me there.

01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:25.946
Yes, she'll wait for me. She said she would.

01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:28.198
What do you mean? What on Earth do you mean?

01:22:33.745 --> 01:22:34.913
Come out of this room.

01:22:35.998 --> 01:22:37.040
Come out.

01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:40.335
I don't know.

01:22:41.336 --> 01:22:43.046
I just don't understand.

01:22:45.924 --> 01:22:48.552
- What happened?
- You had a bad dream.

01:22:48.969 --> 01:22:50.012
About Pauline.

01:22:52.598 --> 01:22:53.974
Oh, yes, now I remember.

01:22:54.933 --> 01:22:57.060
I thought she was alive. She spoke to me.

01:22:58.353 --> 01:23:00.939
- It wasn't real?
- Of course, it wasn't.

01:23:03.192 --> 01:23:05.152
I can't tell anymore.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:08.405
I don't seem to know the difference.

01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:12.993
Stay near.

01:23:13.827 --> 01:23:14.912
Stay close to me.

01:23:16.997 --> 01:23:17.998
I'm afraid.

01:23:18.707 --> 01:23:20.042
I'm afraid of Pauline.

01:23:20.167 --> 01:23:22.503
Why? What reason have you to be afraid of her?

01:23:28.759 --> 01:23:29.760
You don't know.

01:23:35.265 --> 01:23:36.850
You don't know what I've done.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.143
Tell me.

01:23:41.772 --> 01:23:43.273
But I can't hear you.

01:23:44.316 --> 01:23:47.402
I said, I killed her. I helped her commit suicide.

01:23:47.569 --> 01:23:49.154
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:23:49.947 --> 01:23:52.115
She asked me to take her down to the rock.

01:23:52.157 --> 01:23:54.827
I helped her. It was very dark.

01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:58.664
Then she went close to the edge of it.

01:23:59.998 --> 01:24:00.999
I watched her.

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:03.210
I stood there and watched her.

01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:05.379
Then she came up.

01:24:06.255 --> 01:24:08.674
Her face was white through the water and then...

01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:11.301
she called to me.

01:24:11.552 --> 01:24:13.011
"Louise, Louise."

01:24:15.013 --> 01:24:16.140
Then she stopped.

01:24:17.766 --> 01:24:19.226
But I could still hear her.

01:24:19.726 --> 01:24:22.312
And I hear her now: "Louise, Louise."

01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:24.022
Stop it.

01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:26.233
Listen to me.

01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:29.945
This is all nonsense. I don't know why you think these things.

01:24:30.028 --> 01:24:32.990
It's something for a doctor to find out. But none of it's true.

01:24:33.073 --> 01:24:35.659
- Yes, it is.
- It's not true, I tell you.

01:24:37.703 --> 01:24:39.371
I know what happened that night.

01:24:39.454 --> 01:24:42.291
And you had nothing to do with it. You weren't even there.

01:24:42.374 --> 01:24:44.543
Pauline and I were together on the rock.

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:47.546
She said she was cold. I went to the house for a wrap.

01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:50.757
I was only away a few moments, but when I came back she was gone.

01:24:50.841 --> 01:24:54.344
The rest, you know. You were nowhere near that night.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.514
You were in the village. Don't you remember?

01:24:59.725 --> 01:25:01.226
I was in the village.

01:25:02.186 --> 01:25:04.146
- It was my day off.
- Yes.

01:25:06.648 --> 01:25:09.568
You're not just lying to make things right for me?

01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:12.279
You wouldn't lie to me about a thing like that, would you?

01:25:12.362 --> 01:25:13.947
No, you only imagined it.

01:25:18.744 --> 01:25:20.245
I only imagined it.

01:25:21.371 --> 01:25:22.748
I didn't kill her.

01:25:23.123 --> 01:25:25.125
And I didn't help her kill herself.

01:25:25.751 --> 01:25:27.252
I had nothing to do with it.

01:25:28.295 --> 01:25:29.379
Thank you.

01:25:34.384 --> 01:25:37.346
For nearly a year now I've been thinking all kinds of things.

01:25:37.429 --> 01:25:39.932
Why didn't you tell me before? I could've helped you.

01:25:39.973 --> 01:25:41.099
I couldn't.

01:25:41.725 --> 01:25:43.936
I was even afraid to close my eyes at night.

01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:48.273
But it's all right now. It's all right. She's gone.

01:25:48.857 --> 01:25:52.778
Pauline's gone and she'll never come back. No, she'll never come back.

01:26:02.329 --> 01:26:03.997
Good evening, Elsie.

01:26:04.081 --> 01:26:06.458
- Good evening, Elsie.
- Good evening, sir.

01:26:06.542 --> 01:26:08.544
The rest of the luggage is in the car.

01:26:08.627 --> 01:26:10.879
Will you ask Edwards to bring it in, please?

01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:18.720
You're beautiful.

01:26:18.804 --> 01:26:21.431
- Women always are when they're happy.
- Are you happy?

01:26:21.515 --> 01:26:22.975
I've never felt so happy.

01:26:23.016 --> 01:26:26.395
I feel as though I were floating two or three inches off the floor.

01:26:26.478 --> 01:26:28.313
There's only one thing wrong with it.

01:26:28.397 --> 01:26:30.107
- What's that?
- Makes me hungry.

01:26:30.274 --> 01:26:33.152
Elsie, we're starving. I suppose it's too late for dinner.

01:26:33.193 --> 01:26:35.195
- Yes, sir, but I could fix you something.
- No.

01:26:35.279 --> 01:26:38.240
I'll tell you what. Let's go out. Let's make it a real evening.

01:26:38.323 --> 01:26:41.827
- Nightclub, champagne, dancing.
- Dancing? I'd love it.

01:26:42.077 --> 01:26:44.371
- How long will it take you to dress?
- Five minutes.

01:26:44.454 --> 01:26:46.331
All right then, an hour-and-a-half.

01:26:52.254 --> 01:26:54.715
The polka has come a long way since my time.

01:26:54.882 --> 01:26:56.425
Something new has been added.

01:26:56.508 --> 01:26:58.469
Nonsense, we're the best couple on the floor.

01:26:58.552 --> 01:27:01.263
We must be. There's a waiter watching us and taking notes.

01:27:01.346 --> 01:27:05.517
- If we're not the best, we're the happiest.
- I hope none of my stockholders are here.

01:27:10.314 --> 01:27:13.484
Tommy, you may take a short rest and then start mixing me another.

01:27:13.525 --> 01:27:14.776
- Yes, sir.
- Hello.

01:27:14.943 --> 01:27:16.278
I'm not late, am I?

01:27:16.361 --> 01:27:20.199
No. I just came early so I could get in a few practice swings.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.118
Any other boyfriend would've picked me up and brought me here.

01:27:23.202 --> 01:27:24.745
That is exactly why I didn't.

01:27:24.995 --> 01:27:28.665
And to think I'd live to see the day when I'd be referred to as a boyfriend.

01:27:29.249 --> 01:27:31.543
Tommy, you better make that next one a double.

01:27:31.668 --> 01:27:34.546
And the young lady will have a bourbon and ginger ale.

01:27:35.255 --> 01:27:36.465
Without the bourbon.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.175
How many have you had?

01:27:40.385 --> 01:27:41.428
Easily.

01:27:41.637 --> 01:27:44.431
Aren't you overdoing it? How about your insides?

01:27:44.515 --> 01:27:47.309
My liver rushes in where angels fear to tread.

01:27:47.726 --> 01:27:50.354
- I worry about you, David.
- Thank you very much.

01:27:50.979 --> 01:27:52.439
How do you like my dress?

01:27:53.315 --> 01:27:56.819
Construction engineers do not comment on ladies' dresses.

01:27:57.110 --> 01:28:00.072
Sometimes it's not your liver I worry about, it's your mind.

01:28:00.155 --> 01:28:01.281
Thank you again.

01:28:01.365 --> 01:28:05.118
Carol, you're very young, you're very beautiful. I love you very much.

01:28:08.664 --> 01:28:11.083
How American it is to want something better.

01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:12.960
Look, Carol...

01:28:14.294 --> 01:28:17.631
in another few days I've got to be going on back to Canada.

01:28:18.423 --> 01:28:20.175
What's gonna happen between us?

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.760
Well, I don't know about you.

01:28:21.802 --> 01:28:24.346
But I've considered us engaged for quite some time.

01:28:24.763 --> 01:28:28.267
So have I, but that's a nasty way for an engagement to end...

01:28:28.725 --> 01:28:29.810
in a marriage.

01:28:29.935 --> 01:28:31.895
David, do you think we have a chance?

01:28:32.104 --> 01:28:33.605
Do you think it would last?

01:28:34.273 --> 01:28:37.568
I think it would last a reasonable length of time.

01:28:37.776 --> 01:28:40.404
Enough to make it worth the minister's while, anyway.

01:28:40.946 --> 01:28:43.073
David, don't you think we need each other?

01:28:43.907 --> 01:28:46.285
We wouldn't know that until after we're married.

01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:48.620
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?

01:28:49.079 --> 01:28:53.083
Now look, if you're gonna drag horses into this conversation, we're lost.

01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:56.670
Anyway, look at the difference in our ages.

01:28:56.753 --> 01:28:57.796
What of it?

01:28:58.088 --> 01:28:59.715
You're 35, I'm 20.

01:28:59.798 --> 01:29:02.426
After one year of married life with you, I'll look...

01:29:02.468 --> 01:29:04.887
27 or 28, and that's no difference at all.

01:29:06.096 --> 01:29:09.475
You know, come to think of it, that is a very attractive dress.

01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:12.603
It's Dad and Louise.

01:29:13.437 --> 01:29:15.105
Carol and David.

01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:17.316
- Don't.
- What's the matter?

01:29:17.399 --> 01:29:19.568
Your father will probably want us to join them.

01:29:19.651 --> 01:29:20.861
Don't you want to?

01:29:20.944 --> 01:29:22.988
- I'd rather not. Louise.
- She wouldn't mind.

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:24.948
She doesn't really dislike you.

01:29:25.032 --> 01:29:26.116
Beg your pardon, sir.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.119
The gentleman at that table would like to have you join them.

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:30.204
Okay.

01:29:38.587 --> 01:29:41.590
- I thought you were up at the lake house.
- We came back early.

01:29:41.673 --> 01:29:42.883
How are you, Mrs. Graham?

01:29:42.966 --> 01:29:45.344
Why haven't you got your nose to the grindstone?

01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:48.472
Your daughter asked me out tonight. I'm billing you for it later.

01:29:48.514 --> 01:29:50.140
Chivalry is dead.

01:29:50.182 --> 01:29:52.392
You seem to be enjoying your stay in Washington.

01:29:52.518 --> 01:29:54.812
Bring another bottle of this and two more glasses.

01:29:54.895 --> 01:29:56.647
You're old enough to drink champagne.

01:29:56.688 --> 01:29:59.691
- Glad to hear it.
- You mustn't let Dean work you too hard.

01:29:59.858 --> 01:30:02.069
We haven't seen enough of you since you got back.

01:30:02.194 --> 01:30:03.987
- I've been very busy.
- There, you see?

01:30:04.196 --> 01:30:07.491
Mr. Sutton does work too hard. Look how pale he is, and how quiet.

01:30:07.658 --> 01:30:09.284
He never used to be so quiet.

01:30:09.368 --> 01:30:11.453
Is he always this quiet when he's with you?

01:30:11.537 --> 01:30:14.373
Does he talk to you? He's a beautiful conversationalist...

01:30:14.498 --> 01:30:16.542
when he wants to be. Get him to confide in you.

01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:18.627
- I try...
- There might be one or two things...

01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:20.838
that he wouldn't want us to know about him.

01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:23.757
- He looks like a man with a past.
- Most of us do.

01:30:23.841 --> 01:30:26.260
However, we don't consider such things important.

01:30:26.385 --> 01:30:30.139
Besides, anything can be forgiven a man who plays the piano as well as he does.

01:30:30.222 --> 01:30:33.183
Have you ever heard him play the piano, Carol? He's excellent.

01:30:33.559 --> 01:30:36.687
With the proper training he could have become a concert pianist.

01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:38.480
But he wouldn't practice enough.

01:30:38.564 --> 01:30:40.774
And he had the most unfortunate habit of...

01:30:42.401 --> 01:30:45.362
stopping right in the middle of his selection.

01:30:52.244 --> 01:30:53.412
Come in.

01:30:57.166 --> 01:30:59.084
- Do you have any orange sticks?
- Yes.

01:30:59.126 --> 01:31:00.502
In my bed table drawer.

01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:02.671
I don't know what I do with mine. Thanks.

01:31:05.048 --> 01:31:06.216
Stay and talk to me.

01:31:06.925 --> 01:31:08.385
All right.

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:14.141
I didn't know that you and Mr. Sutton were such good friends.

01:31:14.224 --> 01:31:15.851
Why don't you call him David?

01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:19.271
You might as well, you'll be seeing a lot of him from now on.

01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:22.649
Do you like David?

01:31:25.194 --> 01:31:26.737
How does he feel about you?

01:31:27.529 --> 01:31:28.989
About the same, I guess.

01:31:30.657 --> 01:31:31.783
How do you know?

01:31:31.909 --> 01:31:34.912
I can tell by the way he breathes when I go near him. You know.

01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:37.247
Tell me frankly.

01:31:37.664 --> 01:31:39.875
Do you think I'm as attractive as David says?

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:41.585
You're very pretty.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:43.921
And wealthy.

01:31:44.463 --> 01:31:47.966
Both of which would appeal to David. Particularly the money.

01:31:48.884 --> 01:31:50.302
Don't you like David?

01:31:52.805 --> 01:31:53.764
No.

01:31:54.932 --> 01:31:57.267
As a matter of fact, I dislike him intensely.

01:31:57.476 --> 01:31:58.811
For a very good reason.

01:31:58.894 --> 01:32:00.854
- Why? He's never done anything...
- Look.

01:32:00.938 --> 01:32:02.731
I've never asked you this before.

01:32:03.148 --> 01:32:04.650
But it's very important now.

01:32:05.108 --> 01:32:06.401
Do you trust me, Carol?

01:32:07.402 --> 01:32:09.530
I don't know. I've never thought about it.

01:32:09.822 --> 01:32:11.281
I suppose I do, why?

01:32:11.365 --> 01:32:15.327
I've wanted to tell you this so many times but I never could bring myself to do it.

01:32:15.702 --> 01:32:18.580
And when it became obvious that you liked David so much...

01:32:19.122 --> 01:32:20.249
it was too late.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.085
Can't you see what he's like?

01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:25.295
Don't take him so seriously.

01:32:25.796 --> 01:32:28.132
I know something about him you don't know.

01:32:29.383 --> 01:32:32.803
Something that would make everything he's probably said to you a lie.

01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:34.930
What are you talking about?

01:32:45.274 --> 01:32:47.109
I wasn't going to tell you this.

01:32:47.317 --> 01:32:50.028
I thought you'd get over it or realize what he's like.

01:32:50.696 --> 01:32:53.991
But since you haven't, I'll tell you. He's in love with someone else.

01:32:54.783 --> 01:32:56.994
- What?
- You saw how he was tonight.

01:32:57.202 --> 01:33:00.664
He's not in love with you, Carol. Believe me, it's someone else.

01:33:01.165 --> 01:33:02.833
You talk as though it were you.

01:33:03.959 --> 01:33:05.002
Yes.

01:33:05.586 --> 01:33:08.005
He uses you as an excuse to come here to see me.

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:11.216
- I don't believe it.
- I begged him not to hurt you.

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:14.178
And I couldn't tell your father. He likes David so much.

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:17.806
It's better to find out now how he is and be hurt a little than find out...

01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:21.727
- about it later and be destroyed by it.
- I don't believe it. I'll talk to him.

01:33:21.768 --> 01:33:24.730
- Don't be a fool. He'll only lie to you again.
- Let me go.

01:33:34.406 --> 01:33:36.575
- Hello, Elsie.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Sutton.

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:39.036
- Mrs. Graham home?
- Just a moment and I'll see.

01:33:39.286 --> 01:33:41.371
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.

01:33:48.754 --> 01:33:51.256
- Mr. Sutton is calling.
- Tell him I'm not home.

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.383
Don't bother, Elsie, I'll tell him myself.

01:33:53.509 --> 01:33:56.136
- He must have followed me.
- It's all right. You can go.

01:33:57.554 --> 01:33:58.639
What do you want?

01:33:59.139 --> 01:34:01.725
I've just been to see Dean. What did you say to him?

01:34:02.226 --> 01:34:04.228
- About what?
- What did you tell him?

01:34:04.436 --> 01:34:06.438
I told him you want to marry Carol.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.441
- That's the truth, isn't it?
- What else did you say to him?

01:34:10.108 --> 01:34:12.903
- Nothing.
- Don't lie to me, Louise.

01:34:13.946 --> 01:34:16.865
You probably told him the same pack of stupid lies about me...

01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:19.618
that you tried to pawn off on Carol last night.

01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:22.162
She told me about that. That must've been charming.

01:34:22.246 --> 01:34:24.414
You said once that I'd changed, remember?

01:34:24.957 --> 01:34:27.668
Well, you've changed, too. You didn't used to be a liar.

01:34:27.918 --> 01:34:30.546
It wasn't me. I didn't tell him anything. It was Carol.

01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:33.882
She doesn't love you, David. She's tired and wants to be rid of you.

01:34:33.966 --> 01:34:35.092
So she told Dean.

01:34:36.969 --> 01:34:39.513
- What's the matter? Don't you believe me?
- No.

01:34:40.806 --> 01:34:42.307
All right. I lied to him.

01:34:43.392 --> 01:34:44.393
It was easy.

01:34:45.144 --> 01:34:46.395
He believed me, too.

01:34:48.355 --> 01:34:50.149
What're you going to do about it?

01:34:50.232 --> 01:34:52.609
Something I should have done a long time ago.

01:34:52.776 --> 01:34:54.611
Something very naive and simple.

01:34:55.487 --> 01:34:58.157
But it'll probably impress you as being diabolical.

01:34:59.575 --> 01:35:01.326
I'm going to tell him the truth.

01:35:01.743 --> 01:35:04.163
About us, and more particularly, about you.

01:35:04.663 --> 01:35:05.914
He won't believe you.

01:35:06.707 --> 01:35:09.168
You can be as agreeable and charming as you like.

01:35:09.251 --> 01:35:10.669
It won't do you any good.

01:35:10.752 --> 01:35:13.255
- He'll always hate you.
- Not me darling, you.

01:35:14.131 --> 01:35:18.677
But I just can't quite figure out why you started spinning this web of deception.

01:35:19.094 --> 01:35:22.556
I told you once, I'd do anything to keep you from leaving me, and I will.

01:35:22.681 --> 01:35:24.141
- Anything.
- Well.

01:35:24.558 --> 01:35:28.228
Any jailbreak is pretty tough, but I think I can manage this one.

01:35:28.353 --> 01:35:29.521
You'll see.

01:35:29.938 --> 01:35:31.482
I can be very objectionable.

01:35:31.732 --> 01:35:32.983
That, I can believe.

01:35:33.484 --> 01:35:35.402
But you're forgetting just one thing.

01:35:36.195 --> 01:35:37.321
Carol.

01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:39.573
What about her?

01:35:39.698 --> 01:35:42.326
She loves me enough to marry me no matter what you do.

01:35:43.118 --> 01:35:44.203
And I love her.

01:35:45.037 --> 01:35:46.371
Her or her money?

01:35:47.831 --> 01:35:51.877
Well, you have a point there. Her money is an obstacle.

01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:56.590
So I intend spending it just as rapidly as possible.

01:36:01.762 --> 01:36:03.847
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Elsie.

01:36:04.932 --> 01:36:06.767
- Where's Mrs. Graham?
- In her room.

01:36:06.850 --> 01:36:10.354
I don't know whether I should mention it. She's been crying all afternoon.

01:36:10.896 --> 01:36:11.897
Thank you.

01:36:21.949 --> 01:36:24.117
David came back to see me this afternoon.

01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:26.954
And Carol, too. We had a long talk.

01:36:27.996 --> 01:36:29.414
Why did you lie to me?

01:36:30.123 --> 01:36:31.667
Because I felt like it.

01:36:32.417 --> 01:36:33.877
I wanted to lie and I lied.

01:36:35.087 --> 01:36:36.130
Let me alone.

01:36:37.798 --> 01:36:40.509
You've been crying. Elsie told me you've been crying...

01:36:40.592 --> 01:36:41.802
Let me alone.

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:44.304
I want to think.

01:36:45.681 --> 01:36:48.809
I don't know what to do, I want to think and people won't let me.

01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:52.271
I don't feel well.

01:36:54.523 --> 01:36:57.693
I know you don't feel well. I've known it for some time.

01:36:58.026 --> 01:37:00.487
I thought perhaps, things would work themselves out.

01:37:00.571 --> 01:37:02.114
But now I'm not so sure.

01:37:02.531 --> 01:37:05.033
That's why I've asked a doctor to come and see you.

01:37:06.827 --> 01:37:07.828
A doctor?

01:37:08.662 --> 01:37:10.998
You went to the trouble of getting me a doctor?

01:37:12.249 --> 01:37:13.876
That's very thoughtful of you.

01:37:14.293 --> 01:37:15.794
You're very sweet and kind.

01:37:15.878 --> 01:37:18.297
- He's an old friend of mine.
- What kind of a doctor?

01:37:18.338 --> 01:37:19.423
He'll be able to help you.

01:37:19.465 --> 01:37:22.968
- He'll know exactly what to do.
- What kind of a doctor?

01:37:26.096 --> 01:37:27.431
Don't you think I know?

01:37:27.473 --> 01:37:30.601
I've been lying here all afternoon waiting for you to come home...

01:37:30.642 --> 01:37:32.394
knowing what you'd say when you came in.

01:37:32.478 --> 01:37:34.730
"Louise I've asked a doctor to come and see you."

01:37:35.147 --> 01:37:37.524
Knowing what kind of a doctor it would be, too.

01:37:38.025 --> 01:37:41.195
You think there's something wrong with my mind, don't you?

01:37:41.528 --> 01:37:44.615
- This man is a mental specialist, but...
- No, I won't see him.

01:37:44.698 --> 01:37:45.699
Listen to me.

01:37:45.908 --> 01:37:48.452
No, you just want to lock me up, put me away, I know.

01:37:48.577 --> 01:37:50.537
- I'm trying to help you.
- No, you're not.

01:37:50.621 --> 01:37:51.955
You're trying to get rid of me.

01:37:51.997 --> 01:37:54.458
That's why you're calling in a doctor, isn't it?

01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:58.128
I love you. I want you to be well again.

01:37:58.253 --> 01:38:00.672
And you need help. That's all I'm trying to do.

01:38:00.839 --> 01:38:02.299
I only want to help you.

01:38:04.676 --> 01:38:06.094
If only you could.

01:38:06.637 --> 01:38:08.096
I don't know what's wrong.

01:38:08.347 --> 01:38:09.973
I don't know why I'm this way.

01:38:10.015 --> 01:38:11.934
- If you see this doctor...
- No.

01:38:12.351 --> 01:38:15.020
Listen to me, I've only asked him to talk to you.

01:38:16.688 --> 01:38:19.274
- When's he coming?
- He's coming to dinner.

01:38:19.566 --> 01:38:21.485
It'll be very quiet and we can talk.

01:38:22.736 --> 01:38:23.737
All right.

01:38:28.325 --> 01:38:30.869
I'll do what you say. Anything.

01:38:31.453 --> 01:38:32.496
You'll see.

01:38:32.621 --> 01:38:35.666
I won't do anything bad. I just want to please you.

01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:37.584
So I'll do whatever you say.

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.712
Now, can I be alone? I'd like to lie down for a while...

01:38:40.796 --> 01:38:42.840
so I'll be rested when the doctor comes.

01:38:42.923 --> 01:38:45.968
That's better. I'm so glad you feel this way.

01:38:46.093 --> 01:38:48.345
I know everything is going to be all right.

01:38:49.638 --> 01:38:51.849
Rest yourself, darling, and I'll call you.

01:39:27.551 --> 01:39:30.220
Well, I won't ask you to sit down. What do you want?

01:39:31.263 --> 01:39:32.389
I had to see you.

01:39:32.473 --> 01:39:35.392
- I had to talk to you about us. - "Us" is not my favorite topic.

01:39:35.434 --> 01:39:37.019
- Name another.
- All right, me.

01:39:37.728 --> 01:39:40.606
- There are some things you must know.
- It won't do any good.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.734
Will you get out, go home, leave me alone.

01:39:43.817 --> 01:39:44.818
David.

01:39:50.073 --> 01:39:52.868
I'm sorry, Louise, I seldom hit a woman.

01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:55.954
But if you don't leave me alone I'll wind up kicking babies.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.749
It's all right. It didn't hurt.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:02.544
David, I'm ill. Very ill.

01:40:02.795 --> 01:40:05.672
Why come to me? All I can recommend is a couple of aspirins.

01:40:05.798 --> 01:40:07.174
But you've got to listen.

01:40:07.257 --> 01:40:09.593
I've done some terrible things because of you.

01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:12.095
I'm rotting away with the things I've done.

01:40:12.179 --> 01:40:15.265
- The things you've...
- All I've done is fall out of love with you.

01:40:15.307 --> 01:40:16.809
That's a man's privilege.

01:40:16.892 --> 01:40:20.103
I wish sometimes women would avail themselves of the same privilege.

01:40:20.187 --> 01:40:21.438
I made Dean love me.

01:40:21.855 --> 01:40:23.899
It was easy because he was so Ionely.

01:40:24.817 --> 01:40:28.445
I thought if I were married to a rich man I could make you come back to me.

01:40:28.487 --> 01:40:29.905
But now it's all over.

01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:33.075
- I've lost you and now I've lost Dean.
- You haven't lost Dean.

01:40:33.659 --> 01:40:37.329
He wants to help and I know he loves you, he told me that this afternoon.

01:40:37.412 --> 01:40:38.455
No, he doesn't.

01:40:40.123 --> 01:40:43.585
He wants to put me away in an institution and I'd never see you again.

01:40:43.919 --> 01:40:46.088
Talk to him, David. Make him leave me alone.

01:40:46.171 --> 01:40:48.048
Don't let him do it, I'm not insane.

01:40:49.508 --> 01:40:51.802
- What do you mean?
- He thinks I am.

01:40:53.637 --> 01:40:56.265
I don't know what this is all about, Louise, but...

01:40:56.807 --> 01:40:58.475
there's one thing I'm sure of:

01:40:58.684 --> 01:41:00.644
Dean wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

01:41:01.854 --> 01:41:03.981
Now why don't you let me take you home?

01:41:04.523 --> 01:41:05.566
No.

01:41:07.067 --> 01:41:09.820
- I think I'd better call Dean.
- But I don't want you to.

01:41:10.028 --> 01:41:13.657
He'll take care of you. He'll look after you a lot better than I ever could.

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.200
He only wants to get rid of me.

01:41:15.284 --> 01:41:17.619
And you're helping him. You're against me, too.

01:41:17.995 --> 01:41:20.372
Both of you and Carol. You're all against me!

01:41:26.253 --> 01:41:27.254
Going away?

01:41:27.588 --> 01:41:29.840
Yes. Carol and I are getting married tonight.

01:41:29.965 --> 01:41:30.966
No, you're not.

01:41:33.844 --> 01:41:36.930
You're not going to marry her. You're not good enough for her.

01:41:38.307 --> 01:41:41.226
If you're going to shoot me, at least be honest about it.

01:41:42.561 --> 01:41:45.355
You don't give a hoot about Carol and you never have.

01:41:46.565 --> 01:41:50.277
I'd rather be shot by a jealous woman than a noble one, anyway.

01:41:52.488 --> 01:41:55.407
Don't you think we should sit down quietly and think up...

01:41:55.866 --> 01:41:58.160
a better reason for you to shoot me than that?

01:41:58.327 --> 01:41:59.953
Talking won't do you any good.

01:42:00.954 --> 01:42:03.582
It's silly of you to kill me, Louise.

01:42:04.583 --> 01:42:07.628
There's still a lot of pain and unhappiness in store for me.

01:42:09.087 --> 01:42:12.049
You wouldn't want me to miss all that, now would you?

01:42:14.134 --> 01:42:17.262
Now, look, why don't you just give me that before I get hurt.

01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:19.473
I told you.

01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:24.061
I explained it to you, how important it was for you not to leave me again.

01:42:24.186 --> 01:42:25.562
All right.

01:42:26.271 --> 01:42:27.731
Well, go ahead and shoot.

01:42:28.774 --> 01:42:32.236
Mathematically, the chances of your hitting me are slight.

01:42:33.779 --> 01:42:38.242
And as far as killing me, well, I don't think you're that good a shot.

01:42:58.428 --> 01:42:59.596
I killed him!

01:43:04.643 --> 01:43:06.436
Ten years ago, I could've prevented this.

01:43:07.104 --> 01:43:09.982
Five, even two years ago, it could've been prevented.

01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:12.359
It was there for any psychiatrist to see.

01:43:12.693 --> 01:43:15.028
If a child breaks a leg, he's taken to a doctor.

01:43:15.154 --> 01:43:18.448
If he shows signs of mental illness, he's hidden away in a closet.

01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:21.368
- Shut away, until it's too late.
- Dr. Willard, a Mr. Graham...

01:43:21.451 --> 01:43:23.453
is waiting in your office to see you.

01:43:23.912 --> 01:43:25.581
All right. Thanks, Miss Pullie.

01:43:29.001 --> 01:43:30.919
- Dr. Willard.
- Yes, sir.

01:43:31.003 --> 01:43:32.296
My name is Dean Graham.

01:43:32.463 --> 01:43:35.174
- You telegraphed me about my wife.
- Yes, how do you do?

01:43:35.257 --> 01:43:36.717
Won't you sit down, please?

01:43:38.844 --> 01:43:40.888
Doctor, I've never given way to emotion.

01:43:41.054 --> 01:43:43.056
But you can imagine my state of mind.

01:43:43.348 --> 01:43:44.850
Yes, of course I can.

01:43:45.309 --> 01:43:46.477
May I see her?

01:43:46.935 --> 01:43:47.936
Yes.

01:43:48.729 --> 01:43:50.439
She won't recognize you though.

01:43:51.023 --> 01:43:54.151
I must know her condition, Doctor. Tell me everything you know.

01:43:54.276 --> 01:43:56.653
Mr. Graham, it's a clear case of psychosis.

01:43:57.029 --> 01:44:00.115
- Completely unbalanced.
- You mean she's insane.

01:44:00.657 --> 01:44:03.035
Yes, if you insist on using that term.

01:44:03.076 --> 01:44:04.953
- Is it hopeless?
- No, it isn't.

01:44:05.913 --> 01:44:08.499
As a matter of fact, I intend to try and restore her.

01:44:08.957 --> 01:44:10.417
It will take many months.

01:44:10.834 --> 01:44:14.087
But there's every reason to believe that someday she'll be herself.

01:44:14.213 --> 01:44:15.297
Thank God.

01:44:15.756 --> 01:44:18.801
Mr. Graham, I want you to follow me very closely now.

01:44:19.051 --> 01:44:23.555
We human beings act according to certain patterns of behavior.

01:44:24.556 --> 01:44:27.184
Sometimes, why exactly we don't know yet...

01:44:27.267 --> 01:44:28.811
the pattern is broken.

01:44:29.436 --> 01:44:30.771
The wires are crossed.

01:44:31.396 --> 01:44:34.149
The mind cannot evaluate, judge...

01:44:34.942 --> 01:44:36.568
or even function properly.

01:44:37.736 --> 01:44:41.698
Shock follows shock, until eventually the mind gives way.

01:44:43.325 --> 01:44:46.453
The brain loses control and the body sinks into coma.

01:44:47.913 --> 01:44:50.541
Then, in a biblical sense...

01:44:50.874 --> 01:44:53.877
we might say that such a person is possessed of devils.

01:44:54.545 --> 01:44:57.089
And, it is the psychiatrist that must cast them out.

01:44:59.049 --> 01:45:00.217
Substantially...

01:45:00.884 --> 01:45:02.803
this is what happened to Louise.

01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:08.016
She was under great emotional strain the night your first wife killed herself.

01:45:08.767 --> 01:45:11.562
And it was a very simple matter for her tortured mind...

01:45:11.770 --> 01:45:15.357
to develop the delusion that she actually helped Pauline to commit suicide.

01:45:16.984 --> 01:45:19.361
And once the initial delusion was established...

01:45:20.362 --> 01:45:22.823
her present condition was almost inevitable.

01:45:23.282 --> 01:45:24.283
I see.

01:45:25.909 --> 01:45:26.869
Doctor.

01:45:27.119 --> 01:45:29.663
Since, apparently, she has told you all this...

01:45:30.247 --> 01:45:32.708
I presume you know about David Sutton, too.

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:34.793
Yes, Mr. Graham, I do.

01:45:35.085 --> 01:45:37.254
- There'll be a trial, of course.
- Of course.

01:45:38.464 --> 01:45:39.965
I can't predict the outcome.

01:45:41.133 --> 01:45:45.304
But Louise is neither mentally nor morally responsible for any of her actions.

01:45:46.555 --> 01:45:49.641
Whether or not a jury will understand that is beyond my control.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.562
And now, may I see her?

01:45:53.896 --> 01:45:55.522
Yes, Mr. Graham, come with me.

01:46:15.834 --> 01:46:17.252
She looks almost happy.

01:46:18.545 --> 01:46:19.963
Yes, she is, in a way.

01:46:21.006 --> 01:46:23.509
There are no problems in her private world.

01:46:23.759 --> 01:46:24.968
Not now, anyway.

01:46:26.178 --> 01:46:27.721
When she starts to recover...

01:46:28.347 --> 01:46:29.890
She'll suffer, I suppose.

01:46:30.349 --> 01:46:33.185
You and I can have no conception of how she'll suffer.

01:46:33.977 --> 01:46:36.980
- I'd like to spare her that.
- You can't.

01:46:37.564 --> 01:46:39.441
It's pain that made her this way.

01:46:40.359 --> 01:46:43.362
Only through greater pain, and suffering beyond belief...

01:46:44.196 --> 01:46:45.572
will she get well again.

01:46:46.532 --> 01:46:48.242
I'll be there whatever happens.

01:46:48.659 --> 01:46:50.202
However much she suffers.

01:46:51.161 --> 01:46:52.996
I was rather hoping you'd say that.

01:46:53.789 --> 01:46:55.958
She's going to need you, very much indeed.

01:46:56.333 --> 01:46:58.877
- Can I stay here a few moments?
- Yes, of course.

01:46:59.795 --> 01:47:02.131
If she awakens, don't expect too much, though.

01:47:02.965 --> 01:47:06.218
She won't know you. Not for a while.

01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.970
I'll wait.

01:47:18.564 --> 01:47:19.523
I'm here.
