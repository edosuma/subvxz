[upbeat music]

00:23.148 --> 00:24.357
- Enjoy this.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.902
It might be worth
something someday.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.362
Well, I don't know.
We'll see.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.072
- It's an honor
to meet you, Bumper.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.490
I'm really obsessed
with your song.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.992
- The pleasure's all mine.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.244
I couldn't have done it
without the support of my fans.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.456
And my songwriter.
Maybe she signs it?

00:39.497 --> 00:41.041
- Sure.
- Yeah?

00:41.082 --> 00:42.375
- Yeah.
- Oh, this is so exciting!

00:42.417 --> 00:43.710
I've been practicing
my signature

00:43.752 --> 00:45.712
since I was a little kid.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.630
God damn it. "G?"

00:47.672 --> 00:50.884
There's no "G" in Heidi.
What were you thinking?

00:50.925 --> 00:52.510
- See you, man.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.054
[phone notification pings]

00:54.095 --> 00:56.556
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no, what?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.683
- So last night when I
didn't have sex with Gisela--

00:58.725 --> 01:00.018
- Wait, what?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.561
- I said I didn't
have sex with her.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.396
She came on to me
after we had drinks.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.398
But I denied her the cake.
- Oh, why?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.525
- Because I'm focused
on you, Bumper.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.194
This currywurst gets no mustard

01:09.235 --> 01:11.071
until your career is
bing, bang, bomb.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.405
- You know you didn't
have to do that.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.074
- I knew
she was gonna lose her poops

01:14.115 --> 01:15.367
when I didn't give her
the pudding,

01:15.408 --> 01:16.701
and I was right

01:16.743 --> 01:19.371
because
she just texted me this.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.998
- * You can't
tell me when to sing *

01:22.040 --> 01:23.750
* Can't tell me what to do *

01:23.792 --> 01:26.419
* So watch me sing right now *

01:26.461 --> 01:28.838
* I sing when I want to *

01:28.880 --> 01:30.799
* Ooh *

01:30.840 --> 01:35.053
* I sing when I want to *

01:35.095 --> 01:36.888
* I sing when I want to sing *

01:36.930 --> 01:39.641
* And now's when
I want to sing *

01:39.683 --> 01:41.976
* But it's 'cause I wanna sing,
so it's not for you *

01:42.018 --> 01:43.687
* I sing when I want to *

01:43.728 --> 01:45.647
* Boys, don't feel like
you can't sing *

01:45.689 --> 01:47.899
* If to sing's your thing,
then go off, King *

01:47.941 --> 01:49.943
* Lest your voice
has no cred... *

01:49.984 --> 01:51.403
- Is it catchy to you?

01:51.444 --> 01:52.737
- * Your whole head's
a loaf of bread *

01:52.779 --> 01:54.614
* You're a corncob-looking
corny fella *

01:54.656 --> 01:56.533
* You love milk
and a cappella *

01:56.574 --> 01:58.702
* Don't try to sing,
just drink a gallon *

01:58.743 --> 02:01.037
* Milquetoast, corn boy,
Bumper Allen *

02:01.079 --> 02:02.831
* I sing when I want to *

02:02.872 --> 02:08.044
* Ooh, talkin' about you,
Bumper Allen *

02:08.086 --> 02:10.255
- Oh, it's really
not good to me.

02:10.296 --> 02:14.467
- * Bumper Allen *

02:14.509 --> 02:18.138
* This isn't about you,
Bumper Allen *

02:18.179 --> 02:20.223
* I sing when I want to *

02:22.851 --> 02:24.269
- It's a diss track.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.772
And even worse, it's a bop.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.274
You should have given
her your pudding.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.817
- I should have given
her the pudding.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.904
- Yeah, the song
is surprisingly empowering.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.823
Man, I feel like a woman

02:36.865 --> 02:39.159
in a way that only
"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!"

02:39.200 --> 02:41.119
makes me feel like a woman.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.789
- I'm not like what she said
in the video and catchy song.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.334
I'm not, like,
a corny a cappella guy.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.252
I'm cool, right?

02:49.294 --> 02:50.879
Right?

02:52.505 --> 02:55.508
Right?
Hey, I'm cool, right?

02:55.550 --> 02:56.968
- Of course you're cool, man.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.429
My mom and I listen
to your song every night

02:59.471 --> 03:01.264
on the way back
from birdwatching excursions.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.932
- Oh, God.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.351
I'm not cool.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.644
The only thing dorkier
than birds or excursions.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.272
- Hey,
that's why people like you.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.399
You're relatable.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.694
And besides,
the world was built by dorks.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.863
You think a cool guy
invented Stonehenge?

03:16.905 --> 03:19.908
No way, dork central.
Total virgin stuff.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.493
- Yeah, that's where
I'm gonna agree

03:21.534 --> 03:23.036
to disagree with you, Heids.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.871
This is an emergency.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.208
We have to fix my image
if I'm gonna be a star.

[vocalizing]

03:33.797 --> 03:40.303
* *

03:40.345 --> 03:43.723
- I mean, I love
all 11 fans we just met,

03:43.765 --> 03:46.017
but I want cool people
to like me too.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.479
It can't be that hard
for Berliners to accept me.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.981
I've been in Germany for what,
a month now?

03:52.023 --> 03:53.900
I have to reinvent myself.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.195
Go from Bumper to Humper.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.780
I've had sex.

03:58.822 --> 03:59.948
- He has a point.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.283
Unity Day is as much
a popularity contest

04:02.325 --> 04:03.660
as it is a talent contest.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.577
- Yep.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.246
- It couldn't hurt for Bumper

04:06.287 --> 04:08.123
to appeal
to a wider demographic.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.667
Gisela clearly is.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.962
Maybe he needs a flashy video
to outdo her.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.423
- That's what I'm talking
about, videos!

04:16.464 --> 04:18.258
All the greats have videos.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.552
Madonna,
the girl from "The Ring."

04:20.593 --> 04:22.262
But how do we make it cool?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.264
- Verdammt.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.598
I have an idea.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.226
- Okay.
- [speaking German]

04:28.268 --> 04:30.270
- Oh, [speaking German].

04:30.311 --> 04:31.855
- [speaking German]

04:31.896 --> 04:34.274
- We get Klaus
to direct the video.

04:34.315 --> 04:37.652
If Unity Day committee
sees Bumper in Klaus's orbit,

04:37.694 --> 04:38.987
you'll be guaranteed a spot.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.781
- And let's just say aloud,
who is Klaus?

04:41.823 --> 04:44.117
- Only the most
famous avant-garde artist

04:44.159 --> 04:45.243
and director in Berlin,

04:45.285 --> 04:46.578
and no one knows his real name.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.580
He just goes by Klaus,
like Banksy.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.292
Like Wario.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.919
- Whoa, okay.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.588
Wario, "I'm-a gonna win."

04:56.629 --> 04:59.716
- He loves to work
with musicians.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.718
When Ed Sheeran wanted
to reinvent himself

05:01.760 --> 05:03.887
into a bad boy,
he went to Klaus.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.806
- Ed is actually a brunette
from New Jersey.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.350
- Shh.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.934
- I mean,
this Klaus guy seems perfect.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.270
You think we can land him?
- We can try.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.647
- Can't wait for this guy
to help me achieve my dreams

05:14.689 --> 05:17.317
and crush my nemesis.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.277
Oh, my God, that is so cool.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.695
I have a nemesis.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.448
I'm basically Lord Voldemort.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.409
- [singing in German]

05:26.451 --> 05:33.541
* *

06:05.115 --> 06:07.158
- [gasps]
There's Klaus.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.535
You must impress him

06:08.576 --> 06:10.120
if you want him
to direct your video.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.081
- My God, he looks so epic.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.167
Looks like a wizard
or a warlock.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.753
- Let's just go say hi.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.339
You don't just go say hi
to Klaus, okay?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.049
Why don't you grab
some paper towels

06:23.091 --> 06:25.051
for Bumper's
very shiny forehead

06:25.093 --> 06:27.470
while the rest of us
try to come up with a plan.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.598
* *

06:30.640 --> 06:33.101
Da, da, da, da, da, da,
looks good, just don't--

06:33.143 --> 06:34.561
you can look,
but you better not touch.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.854
You know that song?

06:35.895 --> 06:38.898
It's fine.
It just looks--we'll fix it.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.734
- [humming]

06:40.775 --> 06:43.319
* You can't tell me
when to sing *

06:43.361 --> 06:45.280
* Can't tell me what to do *

06:45.321 --> 06:47.615
* So watch me sing right now *

06:47.657 --> 06:50.994
- * I sing when I want to *

06:51.036 --> 06:53.788
[chuckles]

06:55.373 --> 06:56.791
- Gisela?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.169
What the--
- Yes.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.670
Welcome to me.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.589
Oh, thank you.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.717
Oh, gets so hot in this outfit.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.927
Over 40 degrees Celsius,

07:07.969 --> 07:10.388
which, as you know,
is a hot temperature.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.681
- Yeah.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.476
- So you like my single, eh?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.728
- I have to admit, I do.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.229
The song is very empowering.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.106
It feels like it was
written just for me.

07:20.148 --> 07:25.278
- Well, I have to say,
I also like your song,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.489
Miss Heidi Miller.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.449
- Wait, you remember me?

07:29.491 --> 07:30.992
- Of course.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.871
You are Bumper Allen's
talented little songstress.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.916
Now I want you to be mine.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.460
You have been working
for Pieter for years,

07:40.502 --> 07:42.253
and where has it gotten you?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.755
- Well, I guess the bathroom.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.591
But to be fair,
he is a good boss.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.553
- Has Pieter even given you
a salary increase, a promotion,

07:50.595 --> 07:52.347
paid sex leave?

07:52.389 --> 07:53.723
- I can get paid for that?

07:53.765 --> 07:56.893
- Oh, with me you can.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.480
Come and be my songwriter,
Heidi.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.149
My star is rising,

08:03.191 --> 08:06.152
whereas Bumper Allen
is two octaves short

08:06.194 --> 08:07.821
of a children's keyboard.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.864
He does not have the range.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.909
- Uh, I've never really thought
about it like that before,

08:12.951 --> 08:15.203
but I don't think
I can work for you.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.331
- Not for me, Heidi.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.083
With me.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.210
Next to me.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.462
Under me.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.714
Under there.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.298
- Under where?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.425
- You see?

08:28.466 --> 08:30.301
I made you say "underwear."

08:30.343 --> 08:35.348
Already our working
relationship is so...

08:35.390 --> 08:36.766
intimate.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.435
[clicks teeth]

08:38.476 --> 08:40.103
- [gasps] I should go.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.604
- Mm.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.273
- They're probably
wondering where I am.

08:43.314 --> 08:46.192
- [chuckles] Ah, ah.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.069
Here.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.158
[chuckles]

08:55.702 --> 08:57.037
- Hi.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.080
- Oh, Heidi,
we forgot you left.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.168
Okay, when you talk to Klaus,
remember to "smose."

09:03.209 --> 09:04.919
Smile with your nose.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.922
- Okay? Am I doing it?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.592
- Oh, quick, he's coming.
Look cool.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.971
- Hey! Do not touch my art.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.558
The art should only touch you.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.185
- Okay.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.229
- And you both
should know better.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.565
both: Sorry, Papa.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.816
- Papa?

09:26.858 --> 09:28.234
[dramatic music]

09:34.074 --> 09:36.701
- I wish I could say
it was a pleasure,

09:36.743 --> 09:40.246
but then what is pleasure?

09:41.331 --> 09:44.918
What is pleasure?

09:45.585 --> 09:50.215
- So our plan for my future
was to get your dad to help me?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.509
- I have worked
for you for seven years,

09:52.550 --> 09:55.178
and you have never told me
that Klaus is your father.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.972
- Klaus doesn't like us
to tell people we are related.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.724
- It's just
too complicated for him

09:59.766 --> 10:01.226
to be a father and an artist,

10:01.267 --> 10:03.520
so he's mostly just an artist.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.356
- He never really did
normal father stuff with us.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.566
- I've still never been
to an amusement park.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.902
Only to Marfa, Texas.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.406
But all the sacrifices
he made in fatherhood

10:14.447 --> 10:17.242
has made him that much better
of a director,

10:17.283 --> 10:19.369
so lucky us.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.621
- You're right.
He is the best.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.207
We need to land him.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.792
- If you say so.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.378
- [clears throat]
Papa?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.760
- Speak.
- Okay.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.097
Mr. Klaus, it would be an honor

10:39.139 --> 10:40.890
if you would direct
my music video

10:40.932 --> 10:43.977
and fully reinvent me.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.895
- Reinvent me?

10:45.937 --> 10:47.814
I don't think so.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.692
- It seems like you like
to take things apart

10:50.734 --> 10:52.652
and make them cooler.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.362
That is exactly what I need.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.282
Just think of me as one
of these mannequins.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.327
I am blank, pliable,
and completely hairless.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.372
Like a Barbie.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.378
[patting stomach rhythmically]

11:13.131 --> 11:16.343
[clapping rhythmically]

11:16.843 --> 11:18.303
- What are you doing?

11:18.345 --> 11:25.268
* *

11:32.233 --> 11:36.321
- * I'm a Barbie girl
in the Barbie world *

11:36.363 --> 11:39.657
* Life in plastic,
it's fantastic *

11:39.699 --> 11:43.578
* You can brush my hair,
undress me everywhere *

11:43.620 --> 11:47.165
* Imagination,
life is your creation *

11:47.207 --> 11:48.958
* Come on, Barbie,
let's go party *

11:49.000 --> 11:50.168
- * Bow, bow, bow *

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
- * Make me walk,
make me talk *

11:52.087 --> 11:54.172
* Do whatever you please *

11:54.214 --> 11:57.467
* I can act like a star,
I can beg on my knees *

11:57.509 --> 11:59.302
* Come jump in,
be my friend *

11:59.344 --> 12:01.346
* Let us do it again *

12:01.388 --> 12:04.766
* Hit the town, fool around,
let's go party *

12:04.808 --> 12:06.726
all: * You can touch *

12:06.768 --> 12:08.436
* You can play *

12:08.478 --> 12:12.816
* If you say,
I'm always yours *

12:12.857 --> 12:17.070
all: * I'm a Barbie girl
in the Barbie world *

12:17.112 --> 12:20.407
* Life is plastic,
it's fantastic *

12:20.448 --> 12:24.035
* You can brush my hair,
undress me everywhere *

12:24.077 --> 12:27.664
* Imagination,
life is your creation *

12:27.706 --> 12:29.666
- * Come on, Barbie,
let's go party *

12:29.708 --> 12:31.376
all: * Ah, ah, ah, yeah *

12:31.418 --> 12:33.211
- * Come on, Barbie,
let's go party *

12:33.253 --> 12:35.213
all: * Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa *

12:35.255 --> 12:37.048
- * Come on, Barbie,
let's go party *

12:37.090 --> 12:38.675
all: * Ah, ah, ah, yeah *

12:38.717 --> 12:40.844
- * Come on, Barbie,
let's go party *

12:40.885 --> 12:42.554
all: * Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa *

12:42.595 --> 12:44.723
[all cheering]

12:44.764 --> 12:46.474
- Yeah!
- Bravo.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.767
- Yes!

12:47.809 --> 12:50.228
- Bravo, bravo.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.689
I liked it, very strong.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.607
We start work tomorrow.

12:54.649 --> 12:58.486
But you must give
your whole self to my vision.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.072
- Of course.
Yeah, absolutely.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.741
- See you tomorrow.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.075
- See you!

13:04.117 --> 13:05.785
- Goodbye, Leah.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.245
Goodbye, Penis.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.207
- Did he just call you penis?

13:11.249 --> 13:14.252
[upbeat music]

13:14.294 --> 13:21.343
* *

13:26.264 --> 13:29.184
- [singing in German]

13:29.225 --> 13:36.358
* *

13:54.834 --> 13:56.628
- That's the one.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.004
- [gasps]

14:08.723 --> 14:10.266
- Hello.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.102
- Oh, splendid.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.312
An offering
to the purple hamburger god.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.106
- Bumper and I
have America night

14:16.147 --> 14:17.524
where we eat fast food

14:17.565 --> 14:19.818
and we watch our favorite
American reality show,

14:19.859 --> 14:21.403
"I Gave Birth at the Circus."

14:21.444 --> 14:23.571
- * They were on the trapeze *

14:23.613 --> 14:26.825
* Now they're having babies *

14:26.866 --> 14:30.203
both:
* I gave birth at the circus *

14:30.245 --> 14:32.372
- Wait, what happened to you?

14:32.414 --> 14:34.082
- [in German accent]
Ciao, darling. [kisses]

14:34.124 --> 14:36.793
This is the look
that Klaus gave me.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.545
- Aw, he got rid
of your cowlick?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.088
It reminded me
of my first crush,

14:40.130 --> 14:41.297
Dennis the Menace.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.717
- The cowlick
was a nerd antenna.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.677
It had to go bye, bye.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.220
Snip, snip, bitch.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.513
- Okay, you can stop.
- Okay.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.223
- Well, I'm very excited
that we're hanging

14:50.265 --> 14:51.683
'cause I've had
a confusing week,

14:51.725 --> 14:54.102
and I need to decompress
by finding out

14:54.144 --> 14:55.645
if they caught the baby
before it went

14:55.687 --> 14:56.771
through the ring of fire.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.190
- Spoiler alert, they didn't.
- [gasps]

14:59.232 --> 15:01.401
- I know.
But I do have some good news.

15:01.443 --> 15:04.029
Klaus had a few thoughts
about the music

15:04.070 --> 15:05.280
and lyrics to your song.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.948
Instead of the chorus
how we have it,

15:06.990 --> 15:10.410
he wanted it more like
wordless Gregorian chanting

15:10.452 --> 15:12.746
over the metal screams
of the U-Bahn,

15:12.787 --> 15:15.040
so of course I said yeah.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.207
- What the hell?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.877
You can't just change my song.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.171
I finally thought
that we were on the same page

15:21.212 --> 15:22.339
about our partnership.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.840
I barely recognize you.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.467
- And that's a good thing.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.303
This was
the team's genius plan.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.764
Okay, can I be real with you?

15:30.805 --> 15:34.225
In college, I was
the king of mouth music.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.228
Der Konig der Mundmusik.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.857
But now, I'm der konig
der big fat nothing.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.484
Even you said I was a dork.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.319
Klaus can change all that.

15:44.361 --> 15:47.072
He's my one shot to make
all my dreams come true.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.240
- Well, it's your career.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.700
And if you're realizing

15:50.742 --> 15:52.619
that maybe there's more
for you out there,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.287
then maybe you should
consider the options

15:54.329 --> 15:56.623
that were presented
to you in the bathroom.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.957
- Are we still talking
about me?

15:57.999 --> 15:59.834
Because I haven't gone
to the bathroom in hours.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.545
Klaus makes me hold it
until I can taste it.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.089
- [sighs]

16:04.130 --> 16:07.092
[percussive music]

16:07.133 --> 16:14.265
* *

16:16.142 --> 16:18.436
Gisela?
Let's meet up.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.689
I'd like to talk to you.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.440
Okay, Heidi.
That was great practice.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.983
Now let's call her for real.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.528
[bell rings]

16:29.114 --> 16:30.782
- Hey.

16:30.824 --> 16:31.950
Have you seen Heidi?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.952
She was being weird
last time I saw her.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.995
- [gasps] Papa.

16:36.037 --> 16:39.332
Look, Papa's here.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.918
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.130
- Like my friend Trinity
from "The Matrix."

16:45.171 --> 16:46.464
- You think so?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.300
- And before
we start talking,

16:49.342 --> 16:52.470
I want to say Pieter, Thea,

16:52.512 --> 16:56.099
thank you so much
for bringing him to me,

16:56.141 --> 16:57.809
my new friend.

16:57.851 --> 17:03.189
Also, Pieter,
what a big boy you become.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.818
- It's okay.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.696
- That's literally everything
I've ever wanted to hear.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.322
- I know.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.574
But I don't trust it.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.826
- Let's walk to my vision.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.327
Bumper is singing,

17:16.369 --> 17:20.373
and then he meet
his doppelganger.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.709
Doppelganger.

17:22.751 --> 17:23.877
- Huh?

17:23.918 --> 17:28.131
- And step him over,
and over, and over.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.176
Killing his past.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.969
- What?
- Ryan.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.515
- [in Southern accent]
Howdy, do you like my stripes?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.184
I'm getting into character.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.936
- Yeah, we like your stripes.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.313
- I don't look like that.
Do I look like that?

17:43.355 --> 17:44.773
- Um...

17:44.814 --> 17:47.317
- Bumper,
are you Okay with this idea?

17:47.359 --> 17:49.527
He's condemning everything
you've ever done.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.863
- Well, it was your idea
to work with your dad

17:51.905 --> 17:53.406
'cause you didn't
think I was cool enough.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.368
And yeah, no,
I trust Klaus's vision.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.244
- Yeah, Thea, it's not so bad.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.372
Okay, sure,
Bumper's getting stabbed,

18:00.413 --> 18:02.624
but he's doing the stabbing.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.752
- Pieter, I know it's Papa,
but this is wrong.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.046
- [scoffs]
Let's not rock the boat.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.673
Papa called me a big boy.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.342
- Well,
are you a boy-ager

18:12.384 --> 18:14.427
or a manager?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.931
- [exhales softly]

18:17.972 --> 18:19.974
[clears throat]

18:20.016 --> 18:21.810
Say, Papa?

18:21.851 --> 18:22.936
- Yeah?

18:22.977 --> 18:25.814
- Maybe we should
dial this back a bit.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.148
- It is cruel, okay?

18:27.190 --> 18:28.733
You're making fun of a friend.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.027
You do this thing
where your work comes

18:31.069 --> 18:32.696
before anyone else's ideas.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.031
- Or wanting to go
to the amusement park.

18:35.073 --> 18:41.246
- You know, Pieter,
I am the most respected,

18:41.287 --> 18:45.959
most expensive artist
in Berlin,

18:46.001 --> 18:49.129
and you are an outcast.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.423
[tense music]

18:51.464 --> 18:54.342
- [sighs]
Okay, first you bully Bumper.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.970
Now you bully Pieter?

18:57.012 --> 18:58.805
I knew this was a bad idea.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.433
Come on, Bumper.
This isn't you.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.936
- Guys, I mean, come on.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.522
This is Klaus.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.066
This is the only way
I could become someone else

19:10.108 --> 19:11.192
and prove Gisela wrong.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.444
You said so yourself.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.654
Without this video,
I'll never be the person

19:14.696 --> 19:16.448
I need to be to be a star.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.451
I mean, Ed Sheeran, you guys.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.536
[tense music]

19:21.578 --> 19:24.372
- He chose me.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.499
* *

19:26.541 --> 19:29.127
Send them home.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.504
Say goodbye to your friends.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.173
* *

19:33.214 --> 19:36.801
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.095
Goodbye.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.639
- Also, I actually drank
a lot of water today.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.475
Do you mind if I use--
- No.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.727
I told you not
to drink so much.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.979
- I'll just pinch it shut.
- Yep.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.689
[upbeat music]

19:55.653 --> 19:57.739
- I am just so excited
that this is all working out.

19:57.781 --> 19:58.990
Thank you.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.825
- Oh, Heidi, I'm so happy

20:00.867 --> 20:03.787
that you are leaving Bumper
to become my songwriter.

20:03.828 --> 20:07.457
I already feel like we are two
best friends at summer camp,

20:07.499 --> 20:10.293
exploring each other's bodies,
you know?

20:10.335 --> 20:12.671
- Yeah, it, uh--
it was a tough decision.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.756
But in the end,
like your song says,

20:14.798 --> 20:17.175
break every rule
if the rule is wrong.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.720
So here I am being wild.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.222
Whoo!

20:22.263 --> 20:23.306
I'm sorry, was that too loud?

20:23.348 --> 20:25.475
- Oh, no, I like it loud.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.310
- Okay, good.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.396
- With our two talents
combined,

20:29.437 --> 20:31.523
that newcomer slot
will be mine,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.525
and you will be offered
your paid sex leaves

20:33.566 --> 20:34.693
that I promised you.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.237
- Ooh.
I wonder who the lucky guy is.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.406
Or girl. Who knows?

20:39.447 --> 20:42.617
Well, I have jotted down
a list of 30 themes

20:42.659 --> 20:44.035
we could explore
that really push

20:44.077 --> 20:46.037
the girl power message
in your music.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.749
"Sing When You Want To" could
be the tip of the ice-herg.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.545
And yes, I said "herg,"
as in "herstory."

20:53.586 --> 20:55.380
[chortles]
- Okay.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.507
- Just a little wordplay
for you.

20:57.549 --> 20:58.925
- Yeah, wow.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.553
I, uh--
that is really impressive.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.680
And I appreciate
your work ethic

21:03.722 --> 21:06.266
and your penmanship,

21:06.307 --> 21:08.685
but I'm not really looking

21:08.727 --> 21:11.730
for, like,
song ideas right now.

21:11.771 --> 21:16.067
- Uh, what do you mean?
Isn't that why you hired me?

21:16.109 --> 21:19.863
- Well, I actually think
you might be most valuable

21:19.904 --> 21:22.907
on a more, like, micro level.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.369
Like, perhaps providing
insider information

21:26.411 --> 21:28.371
that could help me, um--

21:28.413 --> 21:31.082
[clears throat]
take Bumper down.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.625
- Oh.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.086
Well, if you have great songs,
then you will take him down.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.213
- Yes, but I don't just want
to beat him, Heidi.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.382
I want to destroy him.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.176
This is personal.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.596
He humiliated me live
on my own social media.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.640
- Yeah.
- And then Pieter rejected me.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.684
Rejected me!

21:49.726 --> 21:52.729
Even after I German kissed him.

21:52.771 --> 21:53.980
It's like a French kiss,

21:54.022 --> 21:56.441
but your mouth tastes
like sauerkraut.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.026
It's actually really good.

21:58.068 --> 22:01.780
But I just want
to stick it to him!

22:01.821 --> 22:03.990
Since he wouldn't
stick it to me.

22:04.032 --> 22:05.617
[tense music]

22:05.658 --> 22:08.953
- [clears throat]
Yeah, well, I--

22:08.995 --> 22:11.539
I don't know if this
is what I signed up for.

22:11.581 --> 22:14.084
- Oh, sure it is, Heidi.
Come on.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.002
You're tired of the way
they are treating you.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.713
Otherwise, why would you
even be here meeting with me?

22:18.755 --> 22:21.299
You gotta learn
how to assert yourself.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.551
If you don't, then--
[scoffs]

22:23.593 --> 22:26.221
Who will?

22:26.888 --> 22:29.140
- I'm super pumped
that my friends are gone.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.643
Do you think they're
eating sandwiches right now?

22:31.685 --> 22:34.604
I love sandwiches.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.357
- Time to kill
your doppelganger.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.444
- Uh, yeah, okay, right now?
Okay, yeah.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.072
It's time
to kill my doppelganger.

22:44.114 --> 22:45.740
You know,
maybe after we do that,

22:45.782 --> 22:47.659
you text Pieter and Thea

22:47.701 --> 22:49.244
and apologize,
and say you're sorry,

22:49.285 --> 22:50.495
and make up or whatever.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.623
- I don't apologize,
and I don't text.

22:53.665 --> 22:58.128
I send my messages
with an evil pigeon.

22:59.254 --> 23:00.505
- Okay.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.090
- Let us begin.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.760
[bell rings]

23:05.802 --> 23:07.929
- You can go all out with me.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.848
I stretched beforehand.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.060
- Action!

23:14.102 --> 23:16.104
- * They don't know my name *

23:16.146 --> 23:18.356
* *

23:18.398 --> 23:21.526
- Witness your old self.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.902
* *

23:22.944 --> 23:25.363
- * They don't know my name *

23:25.405 --> 23:27.615
* *

23:27.657 --> 23:30.076
* They don't know my name *

23:30.118 --> 23:32.537
- Now, kill him.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.164
[ominous music]

23:34.205 --> 23:36.916
Kill that loser.

23:36.958 --> 23:40.337
[echoing] Loser, loser.

23:40.378 --> 23:42.797
- Oh!
- Thanks, Bumper.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.424
* *

23:44.466 --> 23:46.134
- To Bumper!

23:46.176 --> 23:47.802
- Kill that bastard!

23:47.844 --> 23:51.514
Kill that loser Bumper!

23:51.556 --> 23:54.267
- Ah!

23:54.309 --> 23:56.353
Ah!

23:56.394 --> 23:57.771
- Durr, I'm Bumper Allen,

23:57.812 --> 24:00.398
and I couldn't have done it
without my team, ugh.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.692
* *

24:02.734 --> 24:04.611
- Kill him!

24:04.652 --> 24:06.029
- [gasps]

24:09.407 --> 24:10.825
Ah!

24:10.867 --> 24:12.452
Yeah, I'm not gonna do this.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.079
I can't shoot this video.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.749
Bumper's out.

24:17.791 --> 24:20.627
- How dare
you walk away from me?

24:20.669 --> 24:23.088
Good luck getting
on to Unity Day

24:23.129 --> 24:24.422
without my help.

24:24.464 --> 24:27.175
[screaming in German]

24:27.217 --> 24:29.052
- Pieter!

24:29.094 --> 24:30.720
Thea!

24:30.762 --> 24:32.514
How am I ever going
to find these guys--

24:32.555 --> 24:33.682
Hey, there they are.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.600
Oh, my God, whew!

24:35.642 --> 24:37.310
And you guys
are eating sandwiches.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.603
I knew it.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.063
- Well, if you're going
to drown your sorrows

24:40.105 --> 24:41.564
in delicious meat
on the street,

24:41.606 --> 24:42.941
Berlin is the place to do it.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.442
- Bumper,
what are you doing here?

24:44.484 --> 24:46.861
I thought you made your choice.
- Yeah, the wrong choice.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.738
I fired your father.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.115
You guys are right.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.200
I never should have turned
my back on who I am.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.829
The who I am is who got me
to Germany to meet you guys.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.707
I was so focused
on being cool,

24:58.748 --> 25:01.751
I just--
I got lost in the sauce.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.044
I'm sorry.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.966
- Well, we are sorry
we introduced you

25:08.008 --> 25:10.343
to him and his sauce.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.387
- I think deep down,
I just wanted an excuse

25:12.429 --> 25:13.471
to talk to him.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.140
Part of me keeps hoping
he'll change

25:15.181 --> 25:16.850
every time I see him,
but he won't.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.393
- Too much sauce.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.687
- He's a dick.

25:20.729 --> 25:23.023
Oh, my God.
I can finally say it.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.483
My daddy's a dick!
- Yes!

25:25.525 --> 25:28.069
- And I greatly dislike Marfa!
- It sucks!

25:28.111 --> 25:29.529
I've been there.
- Wow.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.239
Bumper, I'm impressed.

25:31.281 --> 25:34.242
Pieter never said anything mean
about Papa before he met you.

25:34.284 --> 25:36.411
- I bring out
the worst in people.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.954
- Well, it wasn't just Bumper.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.873
You had my back today.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.500
At least I have
one family member that does.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.252
- Always.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.504
Okay, not always,
but from now on.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.589
- That's fine.
- Okay?

25:47.630 --> 25:50.133
- Yeah.
- Aw, that's cute.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.177
But shut up real quick.
- Okay, shh!

25:52.218 --> 25:53.970
- Just please be quiet.
- Oh, so--

25:54.012 --> 25:55.347
- You're still talking, though.
- I should--

25:55.388 --> 25:56.806
- Quiet, just be quiet.
- This a quiet time?

25:56.848 --> 25:58.933
- Okay, could we just do
the same thing?

25:58.975 --> 26:02.312
Make up, be all cute and stuff,
but with Heidi?

26:02.354 --> 26:04.814
- Where do Americans like
to go besides the Oregon Trail?

26:04.856 --> 26:06.399
- Chuck E. Cheese?

26:08.234 --> 26:11.071
- I think I have an idea
of where she might be.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.079
- [clears throat]
- Heidi?

26:19.120 --> 26:21.664
- Oh, uh--
- Cute place.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.291
How do you know about it?

26:23.333 --> 26:26.920
- I actually told her about it
because I play bar trivia here.

26:26.961 --> 26:28.254
- Huh.
- You do?

26:28.296 --> 26:29.756
- Mm-hmm.

26:29.798 --> 26:31.341
- The other day you sucked
when we all watched Jeopardy.

26:31.383 --> 26:35.553
- Okay, well, since when
is Prince Albert a person?

26:35.595 --> 26:37.305
Anyway, Heidi,

26:37.347 --> 26:39.641
I wanted to tell you
that I finally stood up

26:39.683 --> 26:41.935
for myself, and I fired Klaus.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.853
And I should have
stood up for you too.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.230
I love our partnership,

26:45.271 --> 26:47.774
and I shouldn't have let him
get in the way of us

26:47.816 --> 26:49.484
and change our song.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.489
- While we're admitting things,
I have one for all of you.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.449
- Wait, are you the one
who's breaking into my drawer

26:56.491 --> 26:57.909
and taking little
bites out of my socks?

26:57.951 --> 26:59.661
- What--no.
- Okay.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.788
Well,
they're still out there.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.499
- Bumper, it's--never mind.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.668
Gisela tried to recruit me.
- What?

27:06.710 --> 27:08.169
- She's diabolical.
- Yeah.

27:08.211 --> 27:10.422
She told me that she wanted me
to be her songwriter.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.215
- What did you say?

27:12.257 --> 27:14.634
- To be honest,
I considered it.

27:14.676 --> 27:18.054
You know, I felt like I've been
treated like an afterthought,

27:18.096 --> 27:19.472
and you guys didn't
see me as a peer.

27:19.514 --> 27:22.100
- Oh, Heidi,
I do see you as a peer.

27:22.142 --> 27:25.061
If I was on trial for murder,
you could be in the jury.

27:25.103 --> 27:26.855
- You'd make a great juror.
- Aw.

27:26.896 --> 27:29.107
That's sweet
of you guys to say.

27:29.149 --> 27:33.319
But, no, I realized something
after saying no to her.

27:34.863 --> 27:39.409
I'm not working for Gisela
because I care about you guys.

27:39.451 --> 27:43.204
And she goes after what
she wants for better or worse,

27:43.246 --> 27:46.124
and I have been an assistant
for a very long time--

27:46.166 --> 27:47.876
and that is not your fault,
Pieter.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.295
A lot of my insecurities
came from my own fear.

27:50.337 --> 27:55.216
But if I don't take a risk,
I don't grow, so...

27:55.258 --> 27:59.888
[clears throat]
I can't work for you anymore.

27:59.929 --> 28:03.641
But do you want
to work for me

28:03.683 --> 28:05.393
and be my manager
as a songwriter?

28:05.435 --> 28:08.021
[soft music]

28:08.063 --> 28:11.024
- This is
an obvious no-brainer.

28:11.066 --> 28:13.401
- [exhales] Awesome.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.154
Yeah, shake on it, cool.
- Wait, so is that a yes?

28:16.196 --> 28:17.364
- That was a yes.
- Okay.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.074
Ah, group hug!
- We shook on it.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.575
- Let's hug right now.
Oh, this is our group hug.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.994
Oh, my God, I love being
dorks who group hug.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.412
- I wish we had a video,
though.

28:24.454 --> 28:26.498
Klaus was supposed
to help us take attention

28:26.539 --> 28:28.833
away from Gisela.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.336
- Uh,

28:31.378 --> 28:33.463
I just came up
with another plan.

28:33.505 --> 28:34.714
- Again?
- I know!

28:34.756 --> 28:36.257
How does it keep happening?

28:36.299 --> 28:38.009
It actually hurts a little bit.

28:38.051 --> 28:40.595
* It's all in my head *

28:40.637 --> 28:42.681
* It's all in my heart *

28:42.722 --> 28:47.227
* The light always finds a way
to shine through the dark *

28:47.268 --> 28:49.854
* It's way too late now *

28:49.896 --> 28:52.190
* But turning around *

28:52.232 --> 28:54.025
* I'm right at the edge *

28:54.067 --> 28:56.820
* But I'ma figure it out *

28:56.861 --> 28:59.406
* *

28:59.447 --> 29:00.865
* They don't know my name *

29:00.907 --> 29:07.914
* *

29:08.748 --> 29:11.626
* Today I'm gonna
make it out this room *

29:11.668 --> 29:13.712
* I don't have nothing
to lose *

29:13.753 --> 29:18.049
* I'll be patient 'cause
I know it's on the way *

29:18.091 --> 29:19.843
* But they don't know my name *

29:19.884 --> 29:27.017
* *

29:27.559 --> 29:30.186
* They don't know my name *

29:31.479 --> 29:33.481
- I think we did
a really great job,

29:33.523 --> 29:34.733
even without Klaus.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.861
- I am so glad
you didn't go work for Gisela.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.320
I would have really missed you.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.614
- I would have
missed you guys too.

29:41.656 --> 29:46.202
But now that I'm a songwriter,
and Pieter's over Gisela,

29:46.244 --> 29:48.496
as long as we don't make
it complicated again,

29:48.538 --> 29:50.040
it should all be
smooth sailing.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.583
- Agreed.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.543
See you Thursday
for "Birth at the Circus?"

29:53.585 --> 29:55.086
- Uh, duh.

29:55.128 --> 29:56.671
Last week was such
a cliffhanger.

29:56.713 --> 29:57.630
I got to know if--

29:57.672 --> 29:59.466
both: The lion
ate the placenta.

29:59.507 --> 30:00.675
- I know.
- Great.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.594
- Oh, my God.
'Cause he's going for it.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.888
- But it's a lion.
- Cliffhanger.

30:04.929 --> 30:06.723
- See you Thursday.
- See you.

30:09.768 --> 30:11.227
[sighs]

30:13.063 --> 30:15.148
God, she is so great.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.401
She's so great.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.197
Oh, she's so great.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.407
[dramatic music]

30:24.449 --> 30:26.951
Oh, no.

30:26.993 --> 30:30.163
I'm in love with Heidi.

30:30.205 --> 30:31.831
- * I'm in love with Heidi *

30:31.873 --> 30:33.291
* *
