I’ve got him now.

17:40.041 --> 17:42.291
<i>Ooh, aisle 8. Wow.</i>

17:42.291 --> 17:43.667
Where now? Where now?

17:43.667 --> 17:44.917
<i>Aisle 9.</i>

17:44.917 --> 17:48.000
Where’s the target?
I’ve lost him.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.792
Where is he?

17:49.792 --> 17:51.375
<i>He’s right</i>
<i>over your head, Glen.</i>

18:00.917 --> 18:02.291
Brianna.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.166
Stop right there.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.959
Ooh, well,
aren’t you the cutest?

18:10.417 --> 18:12.208
Yep, pretty much.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.333
Can I go for a ride?

18:14.333 --> 18:15.792
Ooh, of course, Brianna.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.125
Huh?

18:19.125 --> 18:21.083
You’re mine now.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.166
Whoa.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.667
There’s nowhere to go.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.583
Follow that cart.

18:32.583 --> 18:33.500
Okay.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.333
Why are you chasing me?

18:37.333 --> 18:38.333
I do not know.

18:40.417 --> 18:42.208
[grunts]

18:42.208 --> 18:44.166
He’s...

18:44.166 --> 18:45.750
everywhere.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.709
Faster.
I’m giving her
all she’s got!

18:51.500 --> 18:53.458
Give me back my cereal.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.166
Got to catch me first.

19:03.250 --> 19:03.959
Whoa!

19:06.291 --> 19:06.959
Stop right there.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.083
Aah, aah, aah.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.709
<i>Clean up in seafood.</i>

19:21.125 --> 19:21.792
Gotcha.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.917
Nice try, sis.
I got my cereal.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.542
All is right
with the world.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.750
Gotcha!

19:30.750 --> 19:34.291
Look what you’ve done
to my store.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.500
I haven’t done anything.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.750
I think it’s about time
to teach you

19:41.750 --> 19:43.250
some grocery store etiquette.

19:43.250 --> 19:47.000
Hey, no one threatens
my brother but me.

19:49.792 --> 19:53.792
Hmm, all of this running around
has made me hungry.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.083
You wouldn’t dare.

19:56.083 --> 19:56.792
Oh, wouldn’t I?

19:59.834 --> 20:01.542
No!

20:01.542 --> 20:03.000
Solid, sis.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.625
Mom’s headed to the checkout.
Time to fly.

20:23.792 --> 20:24.792
Faster!

20:39.875 --> 20:42.417
Hi, kids.
Sorry it took so long.

20:42.417 --> 20:45.834
Why, Kick, it’s looks
like you earned your cereal.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.250
Yes.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.625
No, your rotten little kids
are nothing but trouble.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.709
They destroyed my store.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.917
They destroyed your store?

20:56.917 --> 21:02.000
Yes, just look at it.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.125
I think your bowtie’s
a little tight.

21:04.125 --> 21:06.583
Not enough air and you start
seeing things.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.291
Come on, kids.
Let’s get moving.

21:08.291 --> 21:11.041
Hey, Glen, see you next week.

21:13.709 --> 21:16.083
<i>Glen, pick up on local, please.</i>

21:16.083 --> 21:17.959
<i>We need to talk.</i>

21:29.750 --> 21:31.875
