[whirring]

00:15.765 --> 00:18.727
- [groaning]

00:21.229 --> 00:24.357
[groaning]

00:32.657 --> 00:33.783
[whirring stops]

00:37.746 --> 00:40.081
You're early.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.751
- * It's true *

00:42.792 --> 00:46.379
* The marriage that we once
had now is through *

00:46.421 --> 00:50.884
* And now we're doing
all that we can do *

00:50.925 --> 00:55.013
* To keep us all together
as a crew *

00:55.055 --> 00:59.017
* Trust, do as we say,
not as we do *

00:59.059 --> 01:02.812
* We really thought
that we were done *

01:02.854 --> 01:05.732
* But we've just begun *

01:08.109 --> 01:10.695
- Sorry you had to see that.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.238
- So are we.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.075
- Jim, this is the living room.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.409
Why were your pants down?

01:16.451 --> 01:17.911
- Because the pain
isn't in my pants.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.746
It's in my glute.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.082
- Jim has always had
glute issues,

01:22.123 --> 01:24.042
and, oh, how I've missed them.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.753
- Glute issues
come from tension.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.629
I don't have tension.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.922
- You don't have tension yet.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.090
But you're marrying Julia,

01:30.131 --> 01:31.257
so keep one of those
in every room.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.135
- I don't have tension.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.261
- You're asymptomatic,

01:35.303 --> 01:36.471
but you give it
to other people.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.265
- Where are the kids,
by the way?

01:39.307 --> 01:40.433
- I left them in the woods
with some bread.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.143
That was three days ago.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.523
Jimmy's playing video games,
and Grace is on TikTok

01:46.564 --> 01:48.483
watching hamsters get married.

01:49.567 --> 01:53.154
- And our children's futures
grow brighter by the moment.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.572
- Yeah, item one,
Jimmy's school

01:54.614 --> 01:56.449
gave the kids
a career aptitude test,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.201
and it said he should be
an evangelist.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.703
- Jesus.
- Exactly.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.665
He seems excited about it,
so that's good.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.418
Although personally, I think
those tests are deeply flawed.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.711
- I remember my test.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.170
It said I should run
for governor someday.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.131
- Mine said I should map
the human genome.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.090
- What about yours, Jim?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.758
What'd it say?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.301
- Doesn't matter.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.345
- Come on.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.723
- It doesn't--

02:19.764 --> 02:21.266
cranberry farmer.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.976
- [laughs]

02:23.018 --> 02:24.769
- Oh, come on.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.271
I was an 11-year-old boy.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.981
I just happened to have
a bladder infection.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.065
- No.
- Hey.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.608
Yes, boys can get them.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.736
Boys have bladders,
and they get infected.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.237
Whatever. It's fine.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.405
It's fine.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.990
OK, item number two.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.950
As you know, it is Grace's
14th birthday tomorrow,

02:38.992 --> 02:40.910
so I booked our special booth
at Stornelli's.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.163
Trey, you're gonna love
this place.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.331
Family style,
spaghetti and meatballs,

02:45.373 --> 02:47.167
big portions,
bottomless bread basket.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.376
And it is my treat.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.836
No arguments, OK?

02:49.878 --> 02:52.756
So come hungry and leave
that big wallet at home.

02:53.506 --> 02:57.010
- Actually, this year,
we have an upgrade.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.970
- An upgrade?
- Tell him.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.305
- I got us into Takane.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.723
- Isn't that fantastic?

03:01.765 --> 03:04.726
- Oh, my God, that is so fa--
what is Takane?

03:06.311 --> 03:09.105
- A new sushi place
that no one can get into.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.732
- No one?
How are they in business?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.360
- Well, no one but Trey.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.527
He made a call.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.321
- I was happy to do it for you.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.573
And for you,
but most of all, for Grace.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.450
And of course,
it'll be my treat.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.118
- Thank you, my love.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.370
- Yes, thank you, her love.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.872
But, Trey--

03:25.914 --> 03:27.916
and I don't blame you for this,
because clearly,

03:27.957 --> 03:28.875
Julia did not tell you.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.960
She's very busy.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.838
The Kearney family always has
birthdays at Stornelli's.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.299
Our pictures are on the wall,
for God's sakes.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.510
- Jim, this is Takane.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.262
- I "understand-ay."

03:42.263 --> 03:43.515
- Grace will love it.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.933
She's always been a foodie.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.559
Even all the way back
in her nursing days,

03:46.601 --> 03:49.270
she strictly preferred
the left breast to the right.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.356
- I go back and forth.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.983
- Yes, you do.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.318
- Hey, hey, I'm right here.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.571
OK, so did Grace
actually tell you

03:58.613 --> 03:59.989
she doesn't want to go
to Stornelli's anymore?

04:00.031 --> 04:01.658
- She didn't have to tell me.
I know.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.742
- You don't know
what Grace knows,

04:02.784 --> 04:04.244
and you know you don't know.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.287
And I know you know
you don't know.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.414
We're going to Stornelli's.
- Takane.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.581
- Stornelli's.
- Jim.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.000
- Julia.
- Trey.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.086
[whirring]

04:19.134 --> 04:19.509
.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.844
- Now, when Julia and I
carefully and painstakingly

04:21.928 --> 04:23.763
mapped out
our post-divorce life,

04:23.805 --> 04:25.890
we may have failed to consider
a few tiny things.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.394
- Like birthdays, graduations,
vacations, first communions,

04:29.436 --> 04:31.354
baptisms, Mother's Day,
Father's Day,

04:31.396 --> 04:32.605
Labor Day, Arbor Day.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.566
- OK, now you're just
naming days.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.526
So there we were,
on our first major occasion,

04:36.568 --> 04:37.819
at an unpredictable impasse.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.320
- It was completely
predictable.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.572
People have birthdays
every year.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.240
- Or like Julia,
every three years.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.533
- That's true.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.285
- So smart people
would have said,

04:45.326 --> 04:47.370
"Hey, let's take a breath."
- "Let's think it through."

04:47.412 --> 04:49.039
- "Let's figure this out
like mature adults."

04:49.080 --> 04:50.248
- But that's not who we are.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.751
- We are the Kearneys.

04:54.210 --> 04:57.047
How could you say yes to Takane
without even consulting me?

04:57.088 --> 04:58.882
- Because I thought
you'd be thrilled.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.342
Every time we go
to Stornelli's,

05:00.383 --> 05:02.344
the meatballs give you
diarrhea.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.847
- Yes, but it's diarrhea
by choice.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.641
A personal sacrifice I make
in the name of parenthood.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.852
A hill I both create
and die on.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.937
You're welcome.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.899
- Can you imagine a woman
would ever tire of this man?

05:15.940 --> 05:18.777
- [groaning]

05:18.818 --> 05:20.445
[voice warbling]
Jim, I am sorry.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.988
I should have consulted you.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.740
- No!
You didn't do anything wrong.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.408
All you did was make
a birthday plan

05:25.450 --> 05:27.077
for his daughter,
your soon-to-be stepdaughter,

05:27.118 --> 05:28.161
without asking him.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.454
- You didn't say
I had to ask him.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.580
- I didn't think
we had to ask him.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.624
- Well, you had to ask him.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.418
- OK, Jim, can we
take Grace to Takane?

05:35.460 --> 05:36.878
- No.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.298
- This is ridiculous.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.301
This man,
this generous man,

05:43.343 --> 05:45.303
calls in a giant favor
for our Grace,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.097
and all you can do
is swat it away?

05:47.138 --> 05:48.890
How do you sleep at night?

05:48.932 --> 05:49.974
- I close my eyes.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.309
Sometimes I--

05:51.351 --> 05:53.103
- You know what I mean.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.813
Ah! Ah! Give me that thing.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.231
Ah!

05:56.272 --> 05:58.108
- Look, I'm sure
Takane is great,

05:58.149 --> 06:00.276
and I'm not saying
I enjoy the diarrhea.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.028
- It would worry me if you did.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.239
- But we are talking
about tradition here.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.491
And in this family,
our birthday tradition

06:06.533 --> 06:07.992
is we dine at Stornelli's,

06:08.034 --> 06:09.911
and then I go home
and uncork my bowels.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.623
- The hell kind
of tradition is that?

06:13.665 --> 06:14.916
That's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.501
I don't even know
what to say anymore.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.004
What kind of conversation
is this?

06:19.045 --> 06:20.463
- The kind of conversation
you can only have

06:20.505 --> 06:22.007
with Jim Kearney.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.883
- I overstepped.
We should go with Jim's plan.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.260
- Well, I think
Jim's overstepped,

06:25.301 --> 06:26.261
and we should go
with your plan.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.220
- Well, I think
you overstepped,

06:27.262 --> 06:28.471
and we should go with my plan.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.514
And that makes
one vote for Takane

06:29.556 --> 06:30.515
and two votes for Stornelli's.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.516
Stornelli's it is.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.101
Prepare the toilets!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.980
- Oh, oh, oh, no, no,
not so fast, big guy.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.356
I think we should let
Grace decide.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.899
- Mm. Great idea.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.735
We'll force our daughter
to choose between her parents,

06:41.776 --> 06:43.069
and then for her
birthday present,

06:43.111 --> 06:45.238
we'll get her
a big box of therapy.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.948
- This is bad.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.241
- Can I just ask,

06:48.283 --> 06:49.909
how do they never notice
the phone?

06:49.951 --> 06:51.202
- Shh!

06:51.244 --> 06:53.163
- If my career test was right,

06:53.204 --> 06:54.706
these people are my flock.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.083
But goodness gracious,
do they need help.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.836
- [voice warbling]
Whatever Grace decides,

06:59.878 --> 07:02.756
we will all accept it
with a smile.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.758
- Why is Mom vibrating?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.718
- Trey, you have hijacked
my daughter's birthday.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.553
You are a daughter's
birthday hijacker.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.055
- I thought I was doing
a nice thing.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.098
- Do you have any idea
how many tragic stories

07:12.140 --> 07:13.391
have started with
those seven words?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.768
- Eight words.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.479
- Ugh, fine.
It'll be all up to Grace.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.357
- No matter what I choose,
I'll be disappointing somebody.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.776
- Well, it's your own fault
for having a birthday

07:22.817 --> 07:24.611
so soon after the divorce.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.237
- That's a stupid thing to say.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.405
- What do you want?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.157
My dad was a cranberry farmer.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.577
- I wish I knew what to do.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.953
- Pray with me.
- Stop it.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.082
Oh, Takane has a website.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
- Stornelli's doesn't.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.250
- Well, if it did,
it would redirect

07:39.292 --> 07:40.919
to Poison Control.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.589
Oh, but Takane looks
incredible.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.717
OK, decision made.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.260
We're going to Takane.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.387
- Dad's gonna be crushed.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.388
- Uh, don't worry.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.139
I have a plan.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.183
- The Lord does too.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.685
What's yours?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.645
- I'm not telling you,
in case it doesn't work.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.022
- Well, that's not
very reassuring.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.817
- You know, for a preacher,
you don't have much faith.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.778
I had to break the news to Dad.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.030
He took it pretty well,
considering.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.281
- Yeah.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.117
Takane.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.827
Great, Grace.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.246
- Well, anyway, he took it.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.414
That was the easy part.

08:23.003 --> 08:23.169
.

08:23.211 --> 08:23.670
[upbeat music]

08:24.963 --> 08:25.922
- You know what?

08:25.964 --> 08:27.382
This place feels right.
- Mm.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.676
- Even the fish in the tank
look happy to be here.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.469
And they're gonna be dead
in 20 minutes.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.929
- Oh, not those bad boys.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.181
Those are koi,
the jewel of the water.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.142
$20,000 each.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.019
- To be worth $20,000,

08:39.060 --> 08:40.520
a fish would have to play
the banjo.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.938
- [laughs]

08:41.980 --> 08:43.940
- Dad, are you sure
you're happy we came here?

08:43.982 --> 08:46.026
- Does the Pope crap
in the woods?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.695
- Don't talk about
my boss like that.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.739
- No, I'm happy.
[chuckles]

08:50.780 --> 08:51.948
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

08:51.990 --> 08:52.866
- 'Cause you're tapping
your lips like

08:52.907 --> 08:54.117
you want to say something,

08:54.159 --> 08:55.326
but you can't let it out.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.870
- Oh, no, I'm simply

08:56.911 --> 08:58.788
preparing my lips
to receive fish.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.457
Summon the waiter.
My lips are ready.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.125
- Oh, there'll be no ordering.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.836
The chef decides the whole
meal, start to finish.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.004
- Wait, what if
I don't like it?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.797
- Then the Lord will smite you.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.175
- Ooh.
- Oh.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.259
- [gasps]
Oh, my God.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.136
This is the uni with dandelion.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.262
- Oh.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.514
A little on the petite side.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.016
- The better to be delectable.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.267
- Uh-huh.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.603
Does uni have a big brother?

09:21.644 --> 09:22.896
- You're gonna love it, Jim.

09:22.937 --> 09:23.772
- OK.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.440
Come here there, little tyke.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.983
Let's see what all
the fuss is about

09:27.025 --> 09:29.694
and if the mortgage-like
prices are justified

09:29.736 --> 09:31.654
by the flavor of this
itty-bitty, little--

09:31.696 --> 09:33.198
oh, dear glory.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.616
That is the best thing
I've ever tasted.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.992
[laughter]

09:36.034 --> 09:38.495
- And now we know
why Jesus multiplied the fish.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.829
- [laughs]

09:39.871 --> 09:41.498
- Why don't we go look
at the koi?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.542
- I need more food first,
or I won't survive the journey.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.711
- OK, well, why don't we go
look at the koi,

09:46.753 --> 09:48.546
and we can give the adults
a chance to talk?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.798
- I can see them from here.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.840
You done with your dandelion?

09:50.882 --> 09:52.092
- Why don't we go look at--

09:52.133 --> 09:53.093
- Look at the koi.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.636
Oh, I get it now.

09:54.678 --> 09:55.845
Ow, ow!

09:55.887 --> 09:57.722
- Grace, Grace,
easy on his ear.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.058
- Jim, I gotta say,
I am so happy

10:00.100 --> 10:01.768
that you're enjoying this meal.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.895
- Anybody with a mouth
would enjoy the meal.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.188
That was never the issue.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.356
- I know.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.691
The issue was about
not being consulted,

10:07.732 --> 10:08.858
and I am sorry about that.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.610
- No, that wasn't the issue.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.612
- That wasn't the issue?
- Oh, I know.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.155
The issue was about
changing tradition.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.199
- Yeah, that wasn't
the issue, either.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.909
- Oh. It wasn't?

10:17.951 --> 10:18.868
- Well, it was part
of the issue,

10:18.910 --> 10:19.994
but it wasn't the issue.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.287
- OK, Jim,
well, what was the issue?

10:21.329 --> 10:22.997
Because the restaurant
closes at midnight.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.874
- Ah.
No need to talk about it.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.292
I gotta go to the men's room.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.877
This place seems like
the kind of place

10:27.919 --> 10:29.045
that would have
a large tip jar in there.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.547
What's the standard
gratuity, Trey?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.382
About 4 grand?

10:32.424 --> 10:35.260
- Like many of us, Jim has
issues discussing his issues.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.179
- Oh, no, I have no such
issues, or issue issues.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.849
- I'm so glad, because we
are all a family now.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.226
- That's right, and families
rely on communication.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.312
- And communication relies
on emotional exhibitionism.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.481
- Yes, so, Jim,

10:48.523 --> 10:51.109
if you need to take off
your emotional pants,

10:51.151 --> 10:56.281
I want you to know
I'm here for you.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.201
- It is spectacularly
clear to me

11:00.243 --> 11:03.079
that you two were
meant for each other.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.748
Uh, can I write a check
in the men's room?

11:04.789 --> 11:07.625
Do you know? Or Venmo?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.377
- You seem agitated, Jim.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.463
You shouldn't pee agitated.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.214
That's how mistakes are made.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.924
Bad for the shoes.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.093
- Look, the issue was

11:17.135 --> 11:18.428
that we didn't know
what Grace wanted,

11:18.470 --> 11:19.721
and then we found out.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.057
Grace wanted Takane,
and so we are here.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.808
Grace is happy,
and therefore I am happy.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.685
My heart is full,
and as it happens,

11:25.727 --> 11:26.770
so is my bladder.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.688
Excuse me.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.192
- Babe, I know
I don't speak fluent Jim yet,

11:32.233 --> 11:33.943
but that does not seem
like a happy man.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.779
- Yeah.
Did--did I miss something?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.280
I didn't, did I? No.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.324
Did I? No.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.161
- Repeat after me.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.288
Tartar sauce.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.248
- Hey, um, Reverend?

11:47.290 --> 11:48.792
- Yes, child?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.503
- I think one
of your flock needs you.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.380
- Look, I'm not gonna deny it,
you know?

11:53.421 --> 11:55.465
Trey's money allows him
to do things for the kids

11:55.507 --> 11:56.925
that I could never do.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.803
When he's around, it's hard
not to feel less than.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.304
But am I supposed
to just capitulate?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.390
You know, stick out
a limp, supplicant paw

12:03.431 --> 12:04.974
and say, "Thank you, Trey,

12:05.016 --> 12:06.434
how do we ever have
a happy day without you?"

12:07.894 --> 12:09.688
Fatherhood, man.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.981
What a ride.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.818
I mean, birthdays
and youth soccer

12:14.859 --> 12:17.278
and, well, violin recitals.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.823
You ever listen to
a five-year-old play violin?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.199
It's horrible.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.534
Horrible.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.369
You can feel it in your teeth.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.620
But you suck it up.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.497
You take video.
Later, you watch the video.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.082
Your teeth hurt again.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.002
But it doesn't matter
because it's your daughter,

12:32.043 --> 12:33.378
and you're her dad.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.338
[sighs]

12:35.380 --> 12:37.590
And then one day, the owner
of your favorite sports team

12:37.632 --> 12:38.925
falls in love
with your ex-wife,

12:38.967 --> 12:41.386
and your daughter forgets
all about you.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.595
It hurts.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.556
It really hurts.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.224
Any advice?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.727
- Yeah, I got some advice.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.690
Don't talk to strangers
in the men's room.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.025
- You said, "How's it going?"

12:55.066 --> 12:56.568
- And you're supposed
to say, "Good,"

12:56.609 --> 12:58.028
and that's the end of it.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.447
Did I tell you that
this is not my real leg?

13:00.488 --> 13:01.865
Or how I lost my real leg?

13:01.906 --> 13:04.325
How much I miss my real leg?

13:04.367 --> 13:05.577
- No, you did not.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.662
- Did I tell you about
my future son-in-law,

13:07.704 --> 13:08.955
the love of my daughter's life,

13:08.997 --> 13:12.208
who has a spider tattoo
on his face?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.293
Not on his neck.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.586
On his face.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.879
Right here.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.423
Daddy long legs.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.799
I did not say that to you.

13:19.841 --> 13:20.884
You know why?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.344
Because you don't do it.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.012
Not in a men's room.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.140
We've been in here so long,
I almost have to go again,

13:27.182 --> 13:30.852
but I am leaving because
this has been so unpleasant.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.021
- Wow.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.230
Whatever happened
to the kindness of strangers?

13:34.272 --> 13:36.066
- We're not strangers anymore.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.817
I wish we were strangers.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.236
We were meant to be strangers.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.114
I know more about your kids
than I do my own!

13:51.748 --> 13:53.750
- It smells like
dandelions in here.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.251
- Jimmy, never enter
a men's room

13:55.293 --> 13:57.796
and say anything
like that again.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.131
- Copy that.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.014
- How you feeling about
your career aptitude test?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.641
Do you know what you'll be
when you grow up?

14:09.683 --> 14:11.142
- Hopefully at the big urinal.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.435
This one's humiliating.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.937
- Hmm.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.939
Well, if the preaching thing
doesn't work out,

14:15.980 --> 14:17.899
you should give
the finance business a shot.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.068
- What's the finance business?

14:20.110 --> 14:22.821
- It's what Trey did before
he bought the Celtics.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.364
Now he can buy
whatever he wants--

14:24.406 --> 14:27.450
basketball teams,
people's affections,

14:27.492 --> 14:31.037
teeny-tiny pieces
of inarguably sublime fish.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.665
Yeah, if I could do it
all over again,

14:33.707 --> 14:38.294
I'd have majored in finance
instead of beer pong.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.006
But let me tell you, if beer
pong ever goes professional,

14:41.047 --> 14:44.843
I'm buying the Red Sox,
and a cranberry farm.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.722
- But if you'd done
anything differently,

14:48.763 --> 14:51.057
then you wouldn't have
been you.

14:51.099 --> 14:55.478
You wouldn't have married Mom,
and I wouldn't exist.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.064
You'd be peeing next to some
other kid right now.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.277
- That's--
you make a good point.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.405
Maybe you should be a preacher.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.364
You done?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.074
- I've been done
for a while, Dad.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.409
I just like talking to you.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.495
[upbeat music]

15:12.537 --> 15:14.539
- For the first time
in history,

15:14.581 --> 15:16.499
my brother did
what I wanted him to,

15:16.541 --> 15:19.961
and I didn't even have to
threaten physical violence.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.629
So we were back on track.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.382
But the most important part
of the plan was still ahead.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.385
I know my family, and I knew
what was about to happen.

15:33.016 --> 15:33.183
.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.059
all: * Happy birthday to you *

15:36.895 --> 15:38.897
- * Ooh *

15:38.938 --> 15:40.357
- Grace, blow out
the birthday candle.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.524
- Go easy, though.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.525
The whole thing could sail
across the room.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.571
- Hey!

15:46.613 --> 15:48.531
[cheers and applause]

15:50.283 --> 15:51.743
- Mmm.
- Oh, my God.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.161
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.621
- Even the birthday cake
is incredible.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.830
- Mmm.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.541
More like a birthday nibble,
but yeah.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.751
Oh.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.211
At least let me get the tip.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.296
Service wasn't that great.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.050
- Wait a second.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.968
That was the whole meal?
- Mm-hmm.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.595
- I thought those were
just appetizers.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.888
- Reverend, polite.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.682
- Reverend starving.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.766
This is a restaurant.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.142
They have a responsibility.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.519
- It's their style.
- Yes.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.520
Famine.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.688
- [sighs]

16:19.729 --> 16:20.772
Can I have some French fries?

16:20.814 --> 16:22.315
- Nothing here is fried.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.942
- What?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.695
Boo! Boo!

16:26.736 --> 16:29.030
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy,
what would Jesus do?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.866
- Beats me, but there's
about to be one less koi.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.410
- Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

16:35.870 --> 16:39.791
- So, um, let me ask,

16:39.833 --> 16:42.043
who besides me
would really love

16:42.085 --> 16:44.087
some spaghetti and meatballs
right now?

16:49.843 --> 16:50.802
- I'm not gonna lie.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.178
I could eat my entire arm.

16:53.054 --> 16:56.016
- Dad, can you save the day?

16:57.434 --> 17:00.145
- Oh, well,
it's a little last-minute,

17:00.186 --> 17:03.857
but um, I think
I can make a call.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.984
- Let's hope
Stornelli's has a phone.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.239
- I didn't realize how much
I had asked of Jim, you know,

17:11.281 --> 17:13.658
what it--what it means
to a man like him

17:13.700 --> 17:15.577
to be a good dad, the dad,

17:15.618 --> 17:17.746
no matter who else
had come along.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.123
- You were less than sensitive.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.751
- Yes.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.336
Thank you.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.087
Uh, but fortunately,
our daughter,

17:26.129 --> 17:27.630
despite her demeanor sometimes,

17:27.672 --> 17:30.550
is actually
the most sensitive of us all.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.260
- I knew what
the best outcome was,

17:32.302 --> 17:35.221
so I manipulated everyone
around me to get it.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.765
- I'm so proud.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.475
[chuckles]

17:38.516 --> 17:42.771
[upbeat music]

17:42.812 --> 17:44.397
Mmm.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.440
[laughs]

17:45.482 --> 17:46.649
- You know what I'm thinking?

17:46.691 --> 17:48.276
- That you've been eating
for 45 minutes,

17:48.318 --> 17:50.737
so how come your plate's
still full?

17:50.779 --> 17:52.405
- It's like
the spaghetti is giving birth

17:52.447 --> 17:54.324
to more spaghetti.
- Mm.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.076
- Should we be dreading
the aftermath,

17:56.117 --> 17:57.410
little Stornelli's
all over the place?

17:57.452 --> 17:59.245
- Nope. Live for the moment.
- OK.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.581
- Actually, I was thinking

18:01.623 --> 18:04.334
that our children
will teach us.

18:07.045 --> 18:11.883
- Jim, Grace is learning
to embrace Trey

18:11.925 --> 18:16.346
because he is a person
very much worth embracing,

18:16.388 --> 18:19.766
and he should be welcomed
into the family

18:19.808 --> 18:22.394
with tenderness and warmth.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.645
- Thank you.
- Still talking.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.522
- Sorry.

18:25.563 --> 18:30.443
- But she knows that
she'll only ever have one dad.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.404
And now you know she knows.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.239
And she knows
you know she knows.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.700
And I know you know
she knows she knows.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.994
And that is worth
a billion dandelions.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.789
[sobbing]
- I will keep that in mind.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.625
- I sure hope so,
because this was exhausting.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.254
- And I promise that next time,

18:49.295 --> 18:51.214
I will be much more considerate
of your feelings

18:51.256 --> 18:52.507
before I dismiss them.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.634
- That's all I ask,
a pause of kindness

18:54.676 --> 18:56.094
before being completely
disregarded.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.303
- Hmm.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.640
Oh, it's me now?

19:00.682 --> 19:03.351
Because I thought
I handled things pretty well.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.312
OK.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.524
Um, I went to MIT.

19:09.566 --> 19:12.235
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the 9:17 MIT mention.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.112
Right on time.

19:14.154 --> 19:19.200
- But my real education started
when I joined this family.

19:20.744 --> 19:21.786
- What have you learned?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.204
- Well, I've learned that

19:23.246 --> 19:25.331
I'd rather be full of pasta
and love at Stornelli's

19:25.373 --> 19:27.625
than hungry and unloved
at Takane.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.420
- Hallelujah.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.715
- Oh.

19:33.757 --> 19:34.883
When was the last time

19:34.924 --> 19:36.009
somebody picked up a check
for you, Trey?

19:36.051 --> 19:38.053
- 2002.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.680
- Then it's my pleasure.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.223
- Thank you.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.892
- It's nice having
our picture on the wall.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.853
- Well, we're the only ones
who've ever come back.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.064
- But maybe it's time
for a new picture.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.732
- You know what?

19:50.774 --> 19:52.067
You're absolutely right.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.651
Can I borrow that?
- What?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.445
- Your phone.
- Seriously?

19:55.487 --> 19:57.197
- Just for a second.
- Where are you going?

19:57.238 --> 19:58.990
- I'm not leaving.
- Don't break it.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.367
- I won't.
- Where's yours?

20:00.408 --> 20:01.743
- In my pocket.
- Just use that.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.203
- Yours is newer.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.412
- Fine.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.791
- What's your password?
- Never.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.464
- How about I get up
and take a picture

20:14.506 --> 20:15.924
of the four of you guys?
- No, no, no, no.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.801
You stay right where you are.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.178
Smile, everybody.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.181
[upbeat music]

20:23.223 --> 20:26.184

[door slams]

20:56.297 --> 20:57.966
OK, OK.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.844
I was wrong!
