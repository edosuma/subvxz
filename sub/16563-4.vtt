00:01.057 --> 00:02.658
Previously on Pitch...

00:02.678 --> 00:04.356
- Ginny called.
- Baker.

00:04.376 --> 00:06.201
Just confirming that we can't...

00:06.221 --> 00:08.512
Not gonna say anything.
Ginny's a big girl.

00:08.547 --> 00:10.947
- She still carries her rookie card.
- Really?

00:10.983 --> 00:11.882
But if it's being watched...

00:11.917 --> 00:14.051
What? You won't make
the All-Star team? Hey!

00:14.086 --> 00:16.219
The only All-Star team
that matters is mine.

00:16.254 --> 00:18.522
And you're already the
leading vote-getter there.

00:18.557 --> 00:20.223
16 years I've been
playing in this town.

00:20.259 --> 00:22.288
I've seen a lot of rookies come and go.

00:22.308 --> 00:25.354
Never met one like you.
Kind of blow me away.

00:25.374 --> 00:28.031
I'm trying to raise
a ball player here, Janet.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.028
Trying a new pitcher.

00:31.337 --> 00:32.536
We did it, Pop.

00:32.570 --> 00:34.699
We ain't done nothing yet.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:43.573 --> 00:44.531
They're watching it now.

00:44.551 --> 00:46.083
- You seen it?
- I got chills.

00:55.860 --> 00:57.876
_

01:05.158 --> 01:07.320
_

01:08.682 --> 01:10.345
Called, strike three.

01:14.346 --> 01:16.880
Put her in the game!
Put her in the game!

01:16.915 --> 01:18.615
Put her in the game!

01:18.650 --> 01:21.885
Put her in the game!

01:30.217 --> 01:32.129
Put her in the game.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.474
It's dominating social media right now.

01:37.494 --> 01:40.249
36 million people
have signed the petition

01:40.284 --> 01:42.575
saying "Put Ginny Baker
in the All-Star Game."

01:42.595 --> 01:46.555
That's twice as many votes
as any player's going to get.

01:47.172 --> 01:49.181
We need to make a decision.

01:53.234 --> 01:55.498
Let's call the commissioner.

02:00.663 --> 02:03.543
Wow. If I'd known you
were such a hothouse orchid,

02:03.563 --> 02:06.664
I would've taken it easy on you.

02:06.684 --> 02:10.502
No, my back's just been acting
up lately. It'll loosen.

02:11.066 --> 02:12.448
You should be
skipping the All-Star Game.

02:12.483 --> 02:14.183
I'm not skipping the All-Star Game.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.185
You can't even get your pants on.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.920
I don't know much about
baseball, but I do know

02:17.955 --> 02:21.405
that it's bad form to play
an All-Star Game without pants.

02:22.667 --> 02:25.067
It's in my home city, for God's
sakes, I'm practically mayor.

02:25.766 --> 02:28.198
You could get some rest.

02:28.427 --> 02:31.561
I could get you a job as an
analyst on the postgame show.

02:31.581 --> 02:33.623
You ever think about
broadcasting as a second career?

02:34.998 --> 02:37.307
Of course I've thought of it.
Look at this face,

02:37.580 --> 02:38.892
look at these guns.

02:38.912 --> 02:42.085
You think I'm gonna deny these to
the world after I'm done playing?

02:42.105 --> 02:44.822
Now, there's three phases
to the Mike Lawson Experience.

02:44.842 --> 02:46.331
Phase one, Mm-hmm.

02:46.351 --> 02:48.090
Hall of Fame Player.

02:48.110 --> 02:50.600
Phase two, Hall of Fame broadcaster.

02:50.855 --> 02:52.102
Phase three,

02:52.122 --> 02:53.567
I move to the South of France, Mm.

02:53.587 --> 02:55.691
I become the greatest horseshoe player

02:55.727 --> 02:57.145
of all time.

02:57.165 --> 02:59.916
That's quite a big
plan you've got there.

02:59.936 --> 03:03.336
Maybe we should stick to
phase one and phase two for now.

03:03.801 --> 03:05.111
You're obviously hurt.

03:05.131 --> 03:07.039
I'm not skipping the All-Star G...

03:08.398 --> 03:09.550
Game.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.248
Okay, uh...

03:14.268 --> 03:16.868
All right, maybe-maybe
a few days off, uh...

03:16.904 --> 03:18.537
wouldn't be so bad.

03:18.572 --> 03:20.105
Set up a meeting.

03:20.688 --> 03:21.907
I already did.

03:29.450 --> 03:30.980
I'm not abandoning you.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.951
You're abandoning me in my hour of need.

03:32.987 --> 03:35.020
Mmm. Yeah, no.

03:35.055 --> 03:37.283
I'm immune to guilt.
Chickenpox and guilt.

03:37.303 --> 03:39.748
- Neither of them get me anymore.
- Evelyn.

03:39.768 --> 03:41.847
The only upside to Blip
not making the All-Star team

03:41.867 --> 03:44.062
is that we finally get to
take this family vacation.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.379
The boys have been begging to go
to Disney World for years.

03:46.399 --> 03:49.744
Mama don't do roller coasters, so Blip's
gonna go on Space Mountain with them.

03:49.764 --> 03:51.903
But does it have to be
when my mother's visiting?

03:51.939 --> 03:53.376
You're my best buffer.

03:53.396 --> 03:55.843
Now I have to spend three
days alone with this woman.

03:55.863 --> 03:57.678
Well, maybe it won't be so bad.

03:57.942 --> 03:59.466
You've met her.

03:59.486 --> 04:01.607
If there was an All-Star Game
for silent judgment

04:01.627 --> 04:03.915
and guilt trips, she'd be MVP.

04:03.951 --> 04:07.001
She's your mom, Ginny.
It can't have been all bad.

04:14.228 --> 04:15.198
Oh, come on.

04:15.218 --> 04:17.243
No, no, you cannot say anything.

04:17.262 --> 04:19.231
Not a word about
getting your ears pierced.

04:19.266 --> 04:20.825
If you do, he's gonna,
like, board up all the doors.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.267
All right, fine,
but you do all the talking.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.551
Okay, I'll do all the talking.

04:23.571 --> 04:25.437
- Just don't make me laugh.
- Okay, I'll try.

04:25.457 --> 04:27.364
Try hard, 'cause if you get me
going, we ain't gonna never

04:27.384 --> 04:28.966
- get out of here.
- Okay.

04:30.177 --> 04:31.376
Be serious.

04:31.412 --> 04:32.403
Okay.

04:33.956 --> 04:35.249
Going to the mall, we'll be back.

04:35.269 --> 04:38.216
Make sure you buy
some oil for your mitt.

04:39.041 --> 04:40.852
Tanner's oil.

04:40.888 --> 04:43.121
Has to be Tanner's oil.

04:43.479 --> 04:45.902
- Ginny, you hear me?
- Heard you.

04:45.922 --> 04:48.093
She heard you, baby.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.438
- I hear you.
- Got the luggage.

04:53.458 --> 04:56.001
All right, well, hang in there, bro.

04:57.271 --> 04:58.837
That was Mike.

04:58.872 --> 05:00.427
He's bailing on the All-Star Game.

05:00.447 --> 05:02.506
What? His back.

05:02.526 --> 05:04.136
He thinks we shouldn't even pack, babe.

05:04.156 --> 05:06.512
He says I'm about to get
a call from the front office

05:06.532 --> 05:09.129
saying that I'm gonna
be the Padres' rep.

05:10.327 --> 05:12.184
We're the home team,
somebody's got to play.

05:12.219 --> 05:14.219
Who else but you?

05:14.254 --> 05:15.947
Nobody.

05:17.091 --> 05:18.423
I told you!

05:18.459 --> 05:19.524
- You did.
- Didn't I tell you?

05:19.560 --> 05:21.126
- You told me.
- Didn't I tell you?

05:21.161 --> 05:22.585
What's going on?

05:22.605 --> 05:24.429
Daddy's gonna play in the All-Star Game!

05:25.389 --> 05:27.292
Give me some.

05:27.312 --> 05:28.935
- Do we get to go to the game?
- Absolutely.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.851
Right after we go to Disney World?

05:32.196 --> 05:34.392
That might have to wait a little.

05:36.576 --> 05:37.800
Hello?

05:38.364 --> 05:39.701
Yes.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.697
Okay, but can...

05:42.675 --> 05:43.996
Uh-huh.

05:46.692 --> 05:48.043
Okay.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.401
Thanks.

05:53.891 --> 05:55.217
That was the front office.

05:55.252 --> 05:58.252
Apparently, I've been named
to the All-Star team.

06:00.164 --> 06:02.499
I'm gonna be the Padres' rep.

06:06.859 --> 06:08.489
We're going to Disney World.

Synced and corrected by johnyd13
~ www.addic7ed.com ~

06:21.478 --> 06:22.926
She's not an All-Star, Jason.

06:22.946 --> 06:25.586
- She's won her last three starts.
- Is she the best of the best?

06:25.606 --> 06:28.016
She is the star of all stars.

06:28.051 --> 06:29.851
And this is the All-Star Game.

06:29.886 --> 06:31.669
You think there's a guy
in the history...

06:31.689 --> 06:32.958
Hey, Baker.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.156
It is good to see you getting
some airtime for a change.

06:35.192 --> 06:39.027
Yeah, we were worried people
might be forgetting about you.

06:39.062 --> 06:40.243
Blip...

06:40.745 --> 06:43.265
No. We are not having
this conversation again.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.014
You're gonna play in this game.

06:45.034 --> 06:48.706
I'm-a go ride around in some tea
cups with my family. It's all good.

06:48.726 --> 06:49.871
All right?

06:52.826 --> 06:55.977
She told me you were
taking them on Space Mountain.

06:56.013 --> 06:58.446
Papa don't do roller coasters.

07:01.351 --> 07:02.884
Just give me 24 hours.

07:02.919 --> 07:04.352
That's all I need.

07:04.388 --> 07:06.388
Thank you, thank you.

07:06.423 --> 07:08.523
Rhonda!

07:08.558 --> 07:10.716
I need you to book me on the
first flight to Amsterdam.

07:10.736 --> 07:12.936
- I'm heading to the airport now.
- You can't do that.

07:12.971 --> 07:15.325
You're the GM of the team
hosting the All-Star Game.

07:15.345 --> 07:16.599
- Listen to me. Rhonda?
- The entire baseball world

07:16.619 --> 07:18.742
- is about to descend upon...
- Rhonda?

07:18.811 --> 07:20.243
Livan's 26.

07:20.312 --> 07:21.278
What?

07:21.313 --> 07:22.813
You heard me.

07:22.848 --> 07:24.982
- That means...
- That means none of the GMs

07:25.002 --> 07:26.950
can know where I'm going, okay?
Do you understand?

07:26.985 --> 07:28.652
I understand what you want me to do.

07:28.687 --> 07:30.620
I don't understand
how I'm supposed to do it.

07:30.656 --> 07:31.955
You're gonna figure it out.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.323
I'll call you from the airport.

07:36.994 --> 07:39.029
You see what I have to put up with?

07:44.803 --> 07:48.271
- Sorry to bother you, Skip.
- No, no. Come on in, kid.

07:49.368 --> 07:52.843
And when I say "kid," I don't
mean it in a Bogart sort of way.

07:52.878 --> 07:54.978
I mean it in that you're a third my age.

07:55.013 --> 07:57.147
Sit down, sit down. What's on your mind?

07:59.718 --> 08:02.407
I don't deserve to be
playing in the All-Star Game.

08:02.427 --> 08:04.121
I was just starting to be
accepted by the guys.

08:04.156 --> 08:06.056
It's terrible timing,
and if I turn it down,

08:06.091 --> 08:08.682
they'll choose Blip, who deserves to go.

08:09.721 --> 08:11.078
All true.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.967
Let me tell you about how I met my wife.

08:17.002 --> 08:18.769
We were at a friend's party.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.138
I approached her at the food
table, I mumbled something

08:21.173 --> 08:24.040
brilliant about the crudités

08:24.076 --> 08:27.077
and somehow I managed to
engage her in a conversation,

08:27.112 --> 08:29.279
and then finally I
asked her if she'd like

08:29.314 --> 08:30.901
to have dinner with me.

08:30.921 --> 08:33.817
She had zero interest.

08:36.357 --> 08:37.821
But I'd just got back from 'Nam.

08:37.856 --> 08:40.256
I took one in the calf,
I was hobbling a little,

08:40.292 --> 08:42.958
and she had a big heart.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.295
So she said yes.

08:45.702 --> 08:47.878
Pure pity date.

08:49.543 --> 08:55.005
42 years, four kids, 12 grandkids later.

08:55.332 --> 08:57.262
Didn't turn out so bad.

08:59.632 --> 09:01.144
I'm not following here, Skip.

09:01.180 --> 09:03.013
Take the pity date.

09:03.658 --> 09:05.448
It doesn't matter why they say yes.

09:05.484 --> 09:08.051
It matters what you do
after they say it.

09:11.421 --> 09:13.290
Okay.

09:15.395 --> 09:18.195
Let's check on the
All-Star schedule, okay?

09:18.230 --> 09:20.897
I don't want to do that.

09:20.933 --> 09:22.265
I'm just dreading having to tell my mom

09:22.301 --> 09:24.034
that I'm not gonna have
any time for her.

09:24.069 --> 09:25.368
Ginny, she's gonna be happy for you.

09:25.404 --> 09:28.038
No, she's not.

09:28.598 --> 09:30.059
Right on cue.

09:30.394 --> 09:31.436
Hi, honey.

09:31.456 --> 09:33.977
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh!

09:34.012 --> 09:35.345
Oh, my baby.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.913
Oh, there she is.

09:36.982 --> 09:38.748
- Amelia, oh, good to see you.
- Welcome.

09:38.784 --> 09:40.159
Thanks for picking her up, Eliot.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.918
- No problem.
- You look well.

09:41.954 --> 09:43.787
Thank you, thank you. So do you.

09:43.822 --> 09:46.089
Three whole days with you all to myself.

09:46.124 --> 09:49.025
- Oh, can you imagine that?
- Yeah, well...

09:49.061 --> 09:51.330
there's been a slight change of plans.

09:51.568 --> 09:53.797
I just got named to the All-Star team.

09:53.956 --> 09:55.131
The All-Star team?

09:55.167 --> 09:56.833
I know, it's crazy.

09:56.868 --> 09:58.368
There was a public campaign...

09:58.403 --> 09:59.769
That's amazing.

09:59.805 --> 10:01.037
That is amazing!

10:01.073 --> 10:05.451
Yeah. It is,
thanks, I'm excited. Um...

10:05.911 --> 10:10.380
but it also means I have a lot to
do that I hadn't planned on, so...

10:13.285 --> 10:15.432
So less time for me.

10:17.044 --> 10:18.524
I'm sorry.

10:20.336 --> 10:23.059
- So what's the plan for tomorrow?
- Um...

10:23.095 --> 10:25.495
tomorrow, I've got a lot
of MLB stuff during the day,

10:25.530 --> 10:27.931
so Eliot's gonna take you

10:27.966 --> 10:29.866
all around the city, show you around.

10:29.901 --> 10:32.698
There's a ton of stuff to do here,
there's LEGOLAND, and...

10:32.718 --> 10:34.308
- Uh, the zoo...
- The zoo.

10:34.328 --> 10:36.818
And then tomorrow night,
we'll get dinner together.

10:37.555 --> 10:39.809
Certainly... looking forward

10:39.845 --> 10:42.351
to getting to spend
some time with Eliot.

10:42.371 --> 10:43.876
Hmm, me, too.

10:45.858 --> 10:46.974
Oh.

10:48.886 --> 10:51.154
Well, I probably should just

10:51.189 --> 10:53.023
go on ahead and get unpacked.

10:53.058 --> 10:55.392
Mom, I didn't... I didn't, um...

10:55.427 --> 10:58.287
I didn't plan this to avoid
spending time with you.

10:58.307 --> 10:59.760
No one said you did.

11:01.769 --> 11:03.033
It's okay.

11:04.749 --> 11:07.040
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:17.383 --> 11:19.462
Wow.

11:19.482 --> 11:22.120
- I had no idea.
- Yeah.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.218
Well, someone once said
when it comes to divorce,

11:24.253 --> 11:26.967
let go of worrying about the money.
Go in knowing you're gonna get killed

11:26.987 --> 11:29.062
and then maybe you'll be surprised.

11:29.082 --> 11:31.384
Well, you could have told me
that before you showed me this.

11:31.404 --> 11:33.196
She gets half the dealerships?

11:33.216 --> 11:35.517
Well, next time listen
to me about the prenup.

11:36.284 --> 11:39.313
You still got one more contract
in you. You'll get some back.

11:39.333 --> 11:42.212
36-year-old catcher
with 65-year-old knees,

11:42.232 --> 11:43.224
and a back that's playing peek-a-boo.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.093
I've got two more
good earning years tops.

11:45.128 --> 11:47.352
So go to the Yankees
or Boston... they pay more.

11:47.372 --> 11:49.933
Or Texas. Get away from
these state taxes...

11:49.953 --> 11:51.499
I'm a Padre.

11:52.493 --> 11:56.004
Then get serious about what
you're doing after baseball.

11:56.039 --> 11:57.963
Oh, I'm dead serious.

11:58.808 --> 12:00.308
I've got a phase two.

12:00.707 --> 12:02.046
And what's that?

12:02.152 --> 12:03.686
All right, you guys ready?
A little rehearsal here.

12:03.706 --> 12:05.780
So, Mike, this is just a run-through

12:05.815 --> 12:08.441
to kind of get you acclimated for the
way it's supposed to go tomorrow.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.363
- Okay.
- You're okay with that?

12:09.383 --> 12:11.901
- Okay, let's do it.
- CJ, ready?

12:12.165 --> 12:14.432
Addison Russell, as you guys know,
will be the starting shortstop

12:14.452 --> 12:17.292
for the National League and
batting ninth. But the reality is

12:17.327 --> 12:19.060
this should be Corey Seager's job.

12:19.095 --> 12:21.586
He has been the best shortstop
in the National League.

12:21.606 --> 12:23.798
And, Mike, you've been
on this National League team

12:23.833 --> 12:26.134
eight times before. What do you
think of this year's squad?

12:26.169 --> 12:27.969
This year's squad? Oh, man,

12:28.004 --> 12:30.138
they're crazy good, even without Kersh.

12:30.173 --> 12:32.307
Cueto's slide-cut combo is lethal.

12:32.342 --> 12:35.786
Scherzer has the most legit
one through four in the bigs.

12:35.806 --> 12:37.027
Lester's a beast.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.347
Among hitters, obviously,
Chris Bryant is the man.

12:39.382 --> 12:41.249
His ISO's at 2.92.

12:41.284 --> 12:44.852
His weighted runs created
plus of 153 last year

12:44.888 --> 12:46.544
is ridonculous!

12:46.564 --> 12:50.091
And his WOBA of .412 is off the charts.

12:50.126 --> 12:52.160
Sorry, you know what? That was, uh...

12:52.195 --> 12:55.094
.40... 403, damn. I-I'll get that.

12:55.114 --> 12:57.198
Uh, Buster Posey is...

12:57.234 --> 12:59.167
Uh, all right, well, stop ri-right there

12:59.202 --> 13:01.269
- for just a minute.
- No, I know, I blew that last one,

13:01.304 --> 13:03.831
but I'll get it tomorrow, okay?
So, you know, don't worry.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.633
But otherwise?

13:08.124 --> 13:10.078
Uh... you know, good...

13:10.744 --> 13:11.845
Yeah?

13:12.039 --> 13:14.046
A little bit too much jargon.
You kind of sounded like

13:14.066 --> 13:16.080
a stat-head and not a baseball
player... Be a baseball player.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.118
And you want to appeal
to the average fan.

13:18.138 --> 13:20.043
Think of the ten-year-old kid
or the grandmother watching.

13:20.063 --> 13:22.290
Right. Okay, yeah. I, you know,
I was just trying to put a little flair

13:22.325 --> 13:23.886
in there, you know,
a little signature style,

13:23.906 --> 13:25.463
but if you think
I should adjust it, I could.

13:25.483 --> 13:27.095
It was unintelligible.

13:28.431 --> 13:29.885
All right.

13:31.334 --> 13:34.545
All right, I'll, uh...
I'll work on it. Yeah.

13:43.672 --> 13:45.880
I hear Al just barely
skated by with his job.

13:45.915 --> 13:47.982
I heard Frank Reid
wasn't quite so lucky.

13:48.018 --> 13:50.505
I heard the same. Rhonda.

13:52.572 --> 13:54.255
Gentlemen, I trust you're
having a good time.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.926
- We are. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

13:55.946 --> 13:57.786
We were just wondering where Oscar is.

13:57.806 --> 13:59.873
Oh, he's wrapping up a meeting.

13:59.893 --> 14:02.411
What kind of meeting's keeping
him from his own cocktail party?

14:02.431 --> 14:03.433
Huh?

14:04.014 --> 14:06.230
It's not a meeting, actually.

14:06.266 --> 14:08.766
It's an abscessed tooth.

14:08.802 --> 14:10.050
Very painful. I was able

14:10.070 --> 14:12.376
to get his dentist to come
down here to drain it.

14:12.396 --> 14:13.918
The tooth that's abscessing.

14:13.938 --> 14:15.807
You should see how
much abscess there is.

14:15.842 --> 14:18.276
I'm gonna get you guys a refill.
I'll be back. Thank you.

14:19.679 --> 14:21.980
- That was weird, right?
- Way weird.

14:22.015 --> 14:24.782
- That was a lie, right?
- Bold-faced.

14:25.482 --> 14:26.812
Livan.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.153
_

14:32.863 --> 14:34.325
What do you mean,
you think they're onto me?

14:34.345 --> 14:37.328
Well, for one thing, it turns
out I'm a terrible liar.

14:37.364 --> 14:39.530
And for another, the story just broke.

14:39.566 --> 14:41.232
And I quote:

14:41.267 --> 14:43.077
"A new report claims that Livan Duarte,

14:43.097 --> 14:45.436
the superstar catcher who
recently defected from Cuba

14:45.472 --> 14:47.565
during a tournament
in Amsterdam is not 22

14:47.585 --> 14:50.541
but is, in fact, 26,
making any team eligible

14:50.577 --> 14:52.349
to sign him immediately
without being taxed."

14:52.369 --> 14:54.142
She told me the story was embargoed.

14:54.162 --> 14:55.737
That's all right.

14:55.757 --> 14:57.582
I have a huge head start.

14:58.514 --> 15:00.451
- Or not.
- What's the matter?

15:00.487 --> 15:02.520
I'm looking at Livan's agent

15:02.555 --> 15:03.855
shaking hands with the general manager

15:03.890 --> 15:05.590
of the New York Yankees.

15:05.625 --> 15:07.753
- Well, that's not good.
- I know.

15:08.895 --> 15:11.033
The next
batter in the Home Run Derby

15:11.053 --> 15:13.653
is second baseman
for the Seattle Mariners,

15:13.689 --> 15:15.255
Robinson Cano.

15:20.095 --> 15:22.562
Cano drives that one to deep center.

15:24.607 --> 15:26.599
It's gone!

15:26.635 --> 15:27.934
You'll be fine.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.654
They're just getting it
out of their system.

15:32.743 --> 15:35.208
And there goes another.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.433
Ah, they can't touch you.

15:41.472 --> 15:44.697
Whoa, that one is way back.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.038
And it's outta here!

15:49.058 --> 15:51.370
He might be able to touch you.

15:51.476 --> 15:52.657
Don't pitch to him.

15:52.677 --> 15:54.995
And time's up.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.400
You trying to pull
a fast one on me?

16:00.435 --> 16:03.770
Daddy power bomb! Boom!

16:03.805 --> 16:05.633
Oh, you trying to get in on it, too?

16:05.653 --> 16:07.381
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.468
I'm trying to decide what theme
park tickets we should get.

16:09.503 --> 16:13.542
Go with whichever one makes the
money magically disappear less.

16:13.562 --> 16:14.734
Pow!

16:15.419 --> 16:18.820
What the hell? Get 'em all!

16:18.856 --> 16:20.589
Time out, time out, time out, time out.

16:22.055 --> 16:23.711
I'm getting a phone call.

16:23.731 --> 16:26.372
Hello. Hold on a sec.

16:27.605 --> 16:31.370
Yes. Okay, I see.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.556
No, that's great. Thank you.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.397
Yeah, thank you so much.

16:37.921 --> 16:39.230
Babe...

16:40.084 --> 16:43.098
Dexter Fowler pulled out.

16:43.118 --> 16:44.366
Hamstring.

16:44.386 --> 16:46.448
I made the All-Star Game!

16:47.484 --> 16:50.052
Oh, wow.

16:50.087 --> 16:52.183
Wow, that's great!

16:52.203 --> 16:54.383
Evy, I'm an All-Star, baby!

16:54.403 --> 16:57.138
- Yeah, I know. I got it.
- Hey...

16:57.158 --> 16:58.635
I get to be introduced

16:58.655 --> 17:00.541
and tip my cap to the home crowd

17:00.577 --> 17:02.410
while watching
the fighter jets fly over.

17:02.445 --> 17:04.467
Yay.

17:06.147 --> 17:08.148
This is the biggest moment of my life.

17:08.184 --> 17:10.817
Are you seriously not happy for me?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.988
Of course. I'm very happy for you, babe.

17:14.530 --> 17:16.080
Wow.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.826
It's nice to have
such a supportive wife.

17:18.862 --> 17:20.895
Excuse me?

17:21.671 --> 17:24.598
No, wait... I'm not supportive?

17:24.634 --> 17:28.002
- Look, how you...?
- No, you said yours. I'm gonna say mine.

17:28.455 --> 17:31.906
I did single-A with you. I did double-A.

17:31.941 --> 17:35.676
I've sat through 0 for 4s
and slumps and benchings.

17:35.712 --> 17:37.979
There's almost a year
of our marriage MIA

17:38.014 --> 17:40.648
for all of the road trips,
and I've never complained.

17:41.138 --> 17:42.950
Not once.

17:42.986 --> 17:47.155
I recap every game,
every moment of your life

17:47.190 --> 17:48.823
every night...

17:48.858 --> 17:51.428
and it's the highlight of my day.

17:53.029 --> 17:54.962
I raise your sons when you're gone.

17:54.998 --> 17:56.731
I keep your home while you're away,

17:56.766 --> 17:58.466
and I'm ready to uproot our lives

17:58.501 --> 18:01.402
if another old man decides
on a whim he wants you more

18:01.437 --> 18:02.937
than the one who currently pays you.

18:03.651 --> 18:06.974
So perhaps you will allow
me one single moment

18:07.010 --> 18:09.010
of disappointment upon learning

18:09.045 --> 18:12.295
our family vacation was
just ruined with a phone call.

18:14.647 --> 18:17.785
The boys and I will
watch the game from here.

18:17.821 --> 18:19.420
I'll take them to the theme park

18:19.455 --> 18:22.845
all by myself like I do
all the time in San Diego.

18:22.865 --> 18:25.459
And we'll see you back
there in a few days.

18:26.019 --> 18:28.129
You go enjoy the biggest
moment of your life

18:28.164 --> 18:30.464
with the fighter planes.

18:33.447 --> 18:36.003
Hmm, turns out watching
the Home Run Derby

18:36.039 --> 18:37.805
is not the cure for
feeling like a fraud.

18:37.841 --> 18:40.174
You're not a fraud.

18:40.210 --> 18:41.742
I should be going over
the hitters with you tonight,

18:41.778 --> 18:43.477
not going to dinner with my mom.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.513
She's gonna make me feel guilty.

18:45.548 --> 18:47.782
- You want me to come?
- Would you?

18:47.817 --> 18:50.885
Sure. Moms love me.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.520
I mean, I gotta do a little prep work

18:52.555 --> 18:54.722
for this broadcast thing,
but I can grab a quick bite.

18:54.757 --> 18:57.158
That would be amazing. Thank you.

18:57.193 --> 18:59.958
Oh, hey, I invited Amelia, my agent.

18:59.978 --> 19:01.696
You met her once?

19:01.731 --> 19:04.532
Anyway, you should talk to her
about the broadcasting stuff.

19:04.567 --> 19:07.235
- She's the best.
- Oh. Good to know.

19:13.176 --> 19:14.602
Nice dress.

19:14.622 --> 19:17.745
- Oh, thanks, Mom.
- You look beautiful.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.147
Um, listen, I hope you don't mind,

19:20.183 --> 19:21.782
I invited a couple friends to join us.

19:21.818 --> 19:23.551
I don't mind. Actually, I invited

19:23.586 --> 19:24.619
somebody to join us, too.

19:24.654 --> 19:25.853
Oh, okay.

19:25.889 --> 19:27.312
Oh, here he is.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.279
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:28.299 --> 19:30.838
Kevin, this is my daughter, Ginny.

19:30.858 --> 19:32.560
Hi. Nice to meet you.

19:32.595 --> 19:34.228
Hello.

19:34.264 --> 19:36.046
Kevin's a friend from Tarboro.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.732
He was in Arizona on business.

19:38.236 --> 19:40.801
When I found out I'd basically
be spending the trip alone,

19:40.837 --> 19:43.136
I just, well, I asked him to join me.

19:43.156 --> 19:44.530
- I see.
- Uh, ladies?

19:44.550 --> 19:45.640
Oh, all right.

19:45.675 --> 19:47.795
Oh, Mom, can I have a moment?

19:48.676 --> 19:50.278
- Oh, uh...
- Sorry.

19:50.313 --> 19:51.812
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

19:52.810 --> 19:53.903
A friend?

19:54.265 --> 19:55.687
We're dating.

19:56.216 --> 19:58.219
And you didn't feel like
giving me a heads-up

19:58.254 --> 20:00.955
that you were inviting him or, I don't
know, that you have a boyfriend?

20:00.990 --> 20:02.623
Oh, you mean, like,
the heads-up you gave me

20:02.659 --> 20:03.991
that you were gonna be
playing in the All-Star Game?

20:04.027 --> 20:05.893
And I don't think I need your permission

20:05.929 --> 20:07.194
to start to date again.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.263
This is so like you to be doing this.

20:09.299 --> 20:11.766
- The night before the All-Star Game.
- What am I doing?

20:11.801 --> 20:13.167
- What am I doing?
- There you are.

20:13.202 --> 20:15.236
Oh, Ginny didn't tell me
she invited her sister.

20:15.271 --> 20:18.139
Don't bother, she's taken.

20:20.414 --> 20:22.576
Hey, Amelia. You remember Mike Lawson?

20:22.612 --> 20:25.746
Uh, yes. We met briefly.
Nice to see you.

20:25.782 --> 20:27.281
You as well.

20:27.317 --> 20:29.317
We were just heading to our table.

20:32.021 --> 20:36.590
Oh, good, you're here.
This is gonna be fun.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.123
- We may want our meal to go.
- Mm.

20:40.410 --> 20:43.111
So, how long you two been a couple?

20:43.147 --> 20:45.547
Oh, no, no. We're not a couple.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.115
No, not...

20:47.151 --> 20:49.484
I didn't even know that Amelia
was gonna be here tonight

20:49.520 --> 20:52.087
when Ginny invited me, no.

20:52.122 --> 20:53.288
No, it was a total surprise.

20:53.324 --> 20:55.224
Right, and since he barely knows me,

20:55.259 --> 20:57.559
- it was just such a boring surprise.
- Right, exactly.

20:57.595 --> 20:59.664
How long have you two been together?

20:59.973 --> 21:01.063
Oh, um,

21:01.098 --> 21:02.297
a little over a year now? Mm-hmm.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.666
A year? Really?

21:04.735 --> 21:07.236
Well, I mean, we knew
each other from a distance.

21:07.271 --> 21:10.072
- Uh, uh...
- Kevin is from Tarboro, where we're from,

21:10.107 --> 21:12.341
- but we, um...
- I was married until recently.

21:12.376 --> 21:14.109
Just got a divorce about a year ago.

21:14.144 --> 21:18.046
So we really got to know
each other after that.

21:18.082 --> 21:20.082
But I've seen you play.

21:20.117 --> 21:21.717
I used to come to a lot of your games.

21:21.752 --> 21:23.252
I mean, the whole town did.

21:23.287 --> 21:25.463
She was a sight to behold.

21:25.569 --> 21:29.258
- Still is.
- Speaking of watching her games, um...

21:29.293 --> 21:32.461
we were hoping we could get Kevin
a ticket to the All-Star Game.

21:32.871 --> 21:35.572
Mm. I only got
the one for you, so...

21:35.592 --> 21:36.822
- It's okay.
- No, no.

21:36.842 --> 21:39.234
I have a couple I'm not
using. Have at 'em.

21:41.071 --> 21:42.925
- Thank you, Mike.
- Wow, thanks.

21:42.945 --> 21:44.740
- Much, much appreciated.
- It's not every day

21:44.775 --> 21:47.509
that your daughter's an All-Star.

21:47.544 --> 21:49.278
No, it's not.

21:53.844 --> 21:55.333
Ginny-bean...

21:58.971 --> 22:01.430
- What is it?
- Open it and find out.

22:03.694 --> 22:05.327
It's a dress for the dance.

22:05.362 --> 22:08.563
- Oh, I love it.
- Well, try it on! Try it!

22:08.599 --> 22:11.667
- Oh, it's so pretty!
- What's all the fuss? What's that?

22:11.702 --> 22:13.568
- It's for the dance tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow?

22:13.604 --> 22:15.616
Oh, no. You're gonna have to miss it.

22:15.636 --> 22:17.440
Bill, this is her first school dance.

22:17.460 --> 22:20.108
And the All-Star travel team
tryouts are on Saturday, and you

22:20.144 --> 22:21.739
- ain't near ready.
- The All-Star travel team?

22:21.759 --> 22:23.245
That means she's gonna be
playing all year-round.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.256
Yeah. She needs to be.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.419
Look, you want to go, go.

22:30.454 --> 22:33.522
You want to spend your time like
all the other girls going to dances

22:33.557 --> 22:35.390
and chasing boys, that's fine by me.

22:35.426 --> 22:37.292
But I ain't gonna be out
there, wasting my time

22:37.328 --> 22:38.314
- on you.
- Oh, for God's sakes.

22:38.334 --> 22:40.540
I'm offering her a choice, Janet.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.653
Now, she's old enough
to make up her own mind!

22:46.193 --> 22:47.703
This is it, little girl.

22:48.272 --> 22:49.771
Decision time.

22:50.122 --> 22:52.274
You want to be a ballplayer?

22:52.309 --> 22:54.276
Because I will take you as far as I can.

22:54.311 --> 22:56.278
I will take you all the way with this.

22:56.313 --> 22:58.714
But you gotta give it
everything you got.

23:04.934 --> 23:06.493
You in or out?

23:24.620 --> 23:26.523
I'll see you out in the yard.

23:31.281 --> 23:32.547
I'm sorry, Mom.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.218
You don't have to apologize to me.

23:36.253 --> 23:38.113
I understand.

23:38.386 --> 23:39.588
Just know this:

23:39.623 --> 23:41.356
If you change your mind,

23:41.392 --> 23:43.825
or if it ever just gets to
be too much for you one day

23:43.861 --> 23:46.161
and you need me to step in,

23:47.503 --> 23:48.792
I'll do it.

23:48.812 --> 23:50.699
I'll be right here waiting.

23:51.610 --> 23:53.368
I love you.

23:54.857 --> 23:56.171
And there is nothing

23:57.043 --> 23:58.206
that you can ever do

23:58.242 --> 24:00.509
to make me stop loving you.

24:04.201 --> 24:06.314
You're young.

24:06.350 --> 24:09.317
I know how hard this is for you.

24:10.754 --> 24:12.014
Come here.

24:17.728 --> 24:19.661
Oscar, this is a waste
of time.

24:19.696 --> 24:22.864
The Yankees have an $8 million
signing bonus on the table.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.666
- You gonna match that?
- Just get me 15 minutes with him.

24:24.701 --> 24:26.868
- Oscar...
- That's all I ask. Come on,

24:26.904 --> 24:28.637
you're gonna have me fly 6,000 miles

24:28.672 --> 24:30.439
sitting next to a guy hacking up a lung,

24:30.474 --> 24:32.441
baby screaming the entire way,

24:32.476 --> 24:34.930
and you won't even let me meet the kid?

24:36.313 --> 24:37.546
I'll see what I can do.

24:37.581 --> 24:39.748
Thank you.

24:45.612 --> 24:46.621
Excuse me, uh...

24:46.657 --> 24:49.524
Where is the nearest toy store?

24:49.560 --> 24:53.027
I just want to say, it's an
absolute pleasure meeting you.

24:53.247 --> 24:54.629
And whatever she did

24:54.665 --> 24:57.632
and your father did,
to make you the pitcher

24:57.668 --> 24:59.301
- you are today...
- Please don't mention my father.

24:59.336 --> 25:01.536
- Ginny.
- Maybe we should get the dessert menu.

25:01.572 --> 25:02.938
I agree. You guys want refills?
More drinks?

25:02.973 --> 25:04.881
He was trying to be nice.

25:06.310 --> 25:07.976
I was just trying to say
that your father was a...

25:08.011 --> 25:11.148
Can we please stop talking
about my dead father?

25:18.010 --> 25:19.796
I'm sorry.

25:19.816 --> 25:21.957
I just... got too much
going on right now.

25:21.992 --> 25:24.798
Clearly, I'm not in the right
frame of mind for company.

25:24.818 --> 25:26.148
Excuse me.

25:34.304 --> 25:37.339
Well, we are still on East Coast time,

25:37.374 --> 25:39.774
so we should probably turn in, too. Thank
you so much, Mike, for the tickets.

25:39.810 --> 25:42.565
Oh, you're welcome. I'll get them,
I'll get them to you.

25:42.585 --> 25:44.713
- I'll leave them for you. A pleasure.
- Thank you.

25:44.748 --> 25:46.815
All right. Good night.

25:47.882 --> 25:50.285
I was right. That was... that was fun.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.988
Ooh.

25:53.345 --> 25:54.756
We need to be more careful.

25:55.151 --> 25:56.358
I didn't invite you.

25:58.573 --> 25:59.995
Heard you crushed your rehearsal.

26:00.030 --> 26:02.531
Oh, that hurts. Ooh.

26:02.566 --> 26:04.332
I'm sure you weren't good at baseball

26:04.368 --> 26:05.567
the first time you tried it, either.

26:05.602 --> 26:07.502
Eh, actually, I was.
I was four for four,

26:07.538 --> 26:10.639
hit two inside-the-park
home runs, I was eight.

26:10.674 --> 26:12.641
Wow.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.619
What if I'm coming
to the end of phase one

26:17.639 --> 26:19.714
and it turns out I'm
no good at phase two?

26:19.750 --> 26:21.516
Then you go straight to horseshoes.

26:21.552 --> 26:24.753
I'm serious. What if I'm no good?

26:28.488 --> 26:30.358
So far...

26:30.394 --> 26:33.435
I haven't found anything
that Mike Lawson's not good at

26:33.455 --> 26:35.253
if he puts his mind to it.

26:43.865 --> 26:46.033
You think they staged
all that so we'd have to pay?

27:18.636 --> 27:22.204
And away we go
in San Diego, California.

27:22.239 --> 27:24.816
It's the best from the National
League against the best

27:24.836 --> 27:27.643
from the American League.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.336
Blip.

27:31.356 --> 27:32.755
I'm so happy you're here.

27:32.791 --> 27:34.463
Ah. Me, too.

27:34.483 --> 27:35.768
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm good.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.856
I'm just... I'm good.

27:38.605 --> 27:40.296
You guys ready?

27:41.398 --> 27:43.666
Let's do it.

27:44.232 --> 27:46.102
All-Stars.

27:53.044 --> 27:55.436
From the St. Louis Cardinals,

27:55.456 --> 27:58.035
Matt Carpenter.

27:58.055 --> 28:00.361
And Aledmys Díaz.

28:02.153 --> 28:05.054
From your hometown San Diego Padres,

28:05.090 --> 28:06.889
Blip Sanders...

28:08.360 --> 28:09.610
Go, babe! Whoo-hoo!

28:09.630 --> 28:12.362
Unable to play but still suiting up,

28:12.397 --> 28:14.230
Mike Lawson.

28:18.837 --> 28:20.703
And Ginny Baker!

28:28.228 --> 28:30.078
Is my mom in your seats?

28:30.849 --> 28:32.749
From the San Francisco Giants,
Brandon Crawford...

28:32.784 --> 28:35.051
She'll be here.

28:38.888 --> 28:42.271
And this is belted out
of here, Kris Bryant,

28:42.291 --> 28:44.727
first pitch swinging, 1-nothing,

28:44.763 --> 28:46.262
National League.

28:47.562 --> 28:49.624
That is a pick by Anthony Rizzo

28:49.644 --> 28:51.033
and a rocket hit

28:51.069 --> 28:53.102
by David Ortiz.

28:55.671 --> 28:57.407
And on the mound,
in what has become

28:57.442 --> 28:59.308
a ritual of historic occasions,

28:59.344 --> 29:01.077
here, literally,

29:01.112 --> 29:04.313
by popular demand, Ginny Baker
has entered the game

29:04.349 --> 29:07.521
and is warming up to start the sixth.

29:08.353 --> 29:11.053
And, Smoltzy, if that
wasn't enough drama for you,

29:11.089 --> 29:12.498
she's being brought in to face

29:12.518 --> 29:14.557
Salvador Pérez, who was actually

29:14.592 --> 29:16.325
the leading vote-getter for the game,

29:16.361 --> 29:20.296
but his numbers paled in
comparison to the onslaught

29:20.331 --> 29:22.136
Ginny garnered on the Internet.

29:22.156 --> 29:25.268
You got to figure that's
sticking in his craw a little bit.

29:25.303 --> 29:27.211
Obviously some controversy

29:27.231 --> 29:29.054
surrounding her selection.

29:29.074 --> 29:31.340
And I'm sure every
part of her is thinking

29:31.376 --> 29:34.210
about justifying that
selection right now.

29:38.773 --> 29:40.983
So, the stage is set.

29:41.019 --> 29:44.187
Baker looks in to get her sign.

29:44.222 --> 29:45.855
She gets it from Posey.

29:45.890 --> 29:47.423
And here's the wind.

29:50.195 --> 29:52.829
This ball is hammered into left!

29:52.864 --> 29:54.797
Back at the wall...

29:54.833 --> 29:56.999
And gone!

29:59.323 --> 30:03.372
Salvador Pérez crushed that one!

30:03.408 --> 30:05.487
That cannot be, at all,

30:05.507 --> 30:08.945
how Ginny Baker wanted
to answer all these critics.

30:08.980 --> 30:11.414
No, I wouldn't think so.

30:30.694 --> 30:33.769
_

30:52.268 --> 30:55.572
_

31:36.965 --> 31:40.033
Livan. This is Oscar Arguella
of the San Diego Padres.

31:42.451 --> 31:43.970
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

31:46.268 --> 31:48.902
No, no, no. Please, no Spanish.

31:48.937 --> 31:50.937
It's too obvious, papi.

31:50.972 --> 31:52.386
Fair enough.

31:56.465 --> 31:59.315
You know how I knew
you were gonna catch that?

31:59.878 --> 32:02.816
'Cause I know that's what
you used for a ball as a kid.

32:03.103 --> 32:05.561
Just like I did. 'Cause neither of us

32:05.581 --> 32:07.387
could afford a real one.

32:08.263 --> 32:10.356
I know what the Yankees
are offering you,

32:10.776 --> 32:12.358
and I can't match it.

32:12.833 --> 32:15.872
I can come close, but I can't match it.

32:16.906 --> 32:20.140
What I can give you is someone

32:20.176 --> 32:22.123
who understands that journey.

32:22.511 --> 32:24.711
No, I didn't grow up in Cuba.

32:24.747 --> 32:27.066
I grew up in Mexico.

32:27.816 --> 32:29.539
And I was not as good as you.

32:29.559 --> 32:31.985
I didn't have a tenth of your talent.

32:32.021 --> 32:34.561
But I know what it's like
to grow up that poor.

32:34.581 --> 32:36.190
And what I know now,

32:36.225 --> 32:39.092
that I didn't know at your age,

32:39.128 --> 32:42.496
is that it's not just about
how rich you can get.

32:42.531 --> 32:45.229
It's about who you
surround yourself with.

32:46.938 --> 32:50.037
When I came up,
I came up with a wild crew

32:50.784 --> 32:51.972
from the minors.

32:52.007 --> 32:55.108
I mean, every night after
every game, out drinking.

32:55.657 --> 32:59.413
I blew my career,
pissed away everything.

32:59.816 --> 33:02.950
Luckily, I had someone

33:03.881 --> 33:05.855
who went out on a limb for me.

33:07.456 --> 33:09.756
Gave me a job as a scout.

33:10.552 --> 33:12.737
That man is my manager today.

33:14.464 --> 33:16.667
He could be your manager, too.

33:17.466 --> 33:20.968
The Yankees can give you
a little more money,

33:21.003 --> 33:23.270
but I can give you a home.

33:23.305 --> 33:26.440
And I promise you
that San Diego will embrace you

33:26.475 --> 33:28.462
as one of their own.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.382
My agent tells me you're
having front-office problems,

33:35.417 --> 33:38.647
- that you're bringing somebody new in.
- I'm not going anywhere.

33:39.288 --> 33:41.088
I'm your guy.

33:53.836 --> 33:56.220
I'm not sitting behind Mike Lawson.

34:00.559 --> 34:02.276
You're never ready to go.

34:02.311 --> 34:04.278
I always do... I be following
the cards all the time.

34:04.313 --> 34:06.280
Right, over... he's okay over there.

34:06.315 --> 34:07.848
I hope he's ready to go.

34:07.883 --> 34:09.157
Make sure we'll help him out.

34:09.177 --> 34:12.219
Okay, here we go, in five, four,

34:12.254 --> 34:13.820
three...

34:18.632 --> 34:20.860
Welcome to the All-Star postgame show

34:20.896 --> 34:23.563
as we come to you live
on Fox... I'm Chris Myers.

34:23.599 --> 34:26.800
Nice to have with us
CJ Nitkowski, Dontrelle Willis,

34:26.835 --> 34:28.034
and a very special guest,

34:28.070 --> 34:29.870
hometown hero Mike Lawson.

34:29.905 --> 34:31.905
And, Mike, it's good to
have you along with us.

34:31.940 --> 34:33.842
- Well, thanks for having me.
- And let's get right to it.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.509
Story of the night, Salvador Pérez

34:35.543 --> 34:37.511
going deep off Ginny Baker.

34:37.545 --> 34:38.596
Give us your thoughts.

34:38.616 --> 34:40.480
Salvy Peréz swings at the first pitch

34:40.516 --> 34:42.199
74% of the time.

34:42.219 --> 34:45.252
I'm sure that Ginny was hoping
to get him to chase one there.

34:45.286 --> 34:49.661
Of course, her walk-to-strikeout
ratio is... it's...

35:00.013 --> 35:02.002
You know, I was getting
dressed in the locker room,

35:02.037 --> 35:05.079
trying to commit all these
essential facts to memory,

35:05.099 --> 35:07.874
and I, uh, and I saw her
give up that home run,

35:07.910 --> 35:09.076
and all I could think of was,

35:09.111 --> 35:11.078
God, this game is hard.

35:11.113 --> 35:13.980
I mean, it is so humbling.

35:14.016 --> 35:15.482
I mean, even those of us
who are All-Stars,

35:15.517 --> 35:18.151
we fail so much of the time.

35:18.187 --> 35:19.619
I mean, great hitters fail

35:19.655 --> 35:22.456
seven out of every ten times at bat.

35:22.491 --> 35:25.459
You know, there's such a fine line
between being too inside your head

35:25.494 --> 35:27.260
and not having your head
in the game enough.

35:27.296 --> 35:29.296
There's just no margin for error.

35:29.331 --> 35:32.099
You know? And yeah, she...
she left one over the plate,

35:32.134 --> 35:34.368
and a great hitter got ahold of it.

35:34.403 --> 35:36.103
And now there's gonna be
even more talk about

35:36.138 --> 35:37.637
how she never deserved
to be here in the first place.

35:37.673 --> 35:40.507
But let me tell you something,
this girl... this woman...

35:40.542 --> 35:42.242
Is a gamer.

35:42.277 --> 35:44.678
She's a total gamer.

35:44.713 --> 35:47.581
Doesn't matter what you throw
at her, she gets back up.

35:47.616 --> 35:50.317
Hell of a lot stronger
than I am, that's for sure.

35:52.054 --> 35:54.121
Not sure if I did any analysis there,

35:54.156 --> 35:56.193
but those are my thoughts.

35:56.213 --> 35:58.325
And, you know, spoken
from the heart, Mike,

35:58.360 --> 36:01.161
and we thank you for that.
Shifting gears here,

36:01.196 --> 36:02.662
I just got a note from our producer,

36:02.698 --> 36:05.365
and I want to get your thoughts
on this breaking news,

36:05.401 --> 36:08.268
because our Ken Rosenthal
has just reported that

36:08.303 --> 36:11.204
highly sought after
Cuban defector Livan Duarte

36:11.240 --> 36:12.939
has just announced he's signed

36:12.975 --> 36:14.975
with none other than
the San Diego Padres.

36:15.010 --> 36:16.543
Most people had him
going to the Yankees.

36:16.578 --> 36:18.545
And I don't want to
put you on the spot here,

36:18.580 --> 36:21.148
but, Mike, Duarte is a catcher,

36:21.183 --> 36:22.949
he's coming to your team,

36:22.985 --> 36:26.219
so you must have a reaction to this.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.094
Yeah.

36:33.228 --> 36:35.795
That guy's not taking my job.

36:48.971 --> 36:51.304
Ginny?

36:52.608 --> 36:54.774
Ginny-bean?

36:54.810 --> 36:56.587
Didn't you hear me knocking?

36:56.607 --> 36:58.719
It's time to take your studs out.

36:58.739 --> 37:00.560
I got you some hoop earrings.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.102
I won't be able to wear them.

37:02.122 --> 37:04.351
I'll be playing baseball.

37:13.629 --> 37:15.862
Ginny, you want some water?

37:19.529 --> 37:21.067
What's gotten into you?

37:32.414 --> 37:34.814
Where were you?

37:34.850 --> 37:36.338
You go through the trouble
to ask for a ticket,

37:36.358 --> 37:39.019
- you don't even show?
- I was taking Kevin to the airport.

37:39.054 --> 37:40.754
He didn't feel comfortable being there.

37:40.789 --> 37:42.775
I didn't exactly feel welcome, either.

37:42.795 --> 37:45.225
You are unbelievable.
It's always about you.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.429
You couldn't put your
ego aside for one start?

37:47.449 --> 37:50.363
- For the All-Star Game?
- There's always another start,

37:50.399 --> 37:51.765
and another, and then another

37:51.800 --> 37:55.368
since you were 12 years old. And
when has it ever been about me?

37:56.544 --> 37:58.465
You never liked baseball.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.940
You always tied it to Pop's death.

38:00.976 --> 38:04.744
Baseball didn't kill your father.
A drunk driver killed your father.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.146
Baseball killed my marriage

38:06.181 --> 38:07.847
and took my daughter away from me.

38:07.883 --> 38:11.051
- That's not true. No.
- Isn't it?

38:12.870 --> 38:15.231
I just don't understand.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.724
We used to be so close.
Now I can't even get

38:17.759 --> 38:20.060
three hours with you.

38:23.014 --> 38:24.943
Losing your father...

38:26.468 --> 38:28.275
was incredibly painful.

38:28.295 --> 38:31.371
But it happened a long
time before he died.

38:33.141 --> 38:34.523
Losing you...

38:39.781 --> 38:42.082
The most painful thing
that ever happened to me.

38:44.402 --> 38:46.270
Why did you shut me out?

38:46.772 --> 38:49.723
I never made you choose. Why?

38:52.655 --> 38:53.927
Why?

39:05.874 --> 39:09.175
I love you, and there is nothing

39:09.772 --> 39:13.713
that you can ever do
to make me stop loving you.

39:16.017 --> 39:17.552
You're young.

39:18.386 --> 39:20.489
I know how hard this is for you.

39:29.273 --> 39:30.736
Because I was young...

39:33.869 --> 39:36.503
and I didn't realize
how hard it was for you.

39:44.832 --> 39:46.717
So where does that leave us?

39:48.742 --> 39:50.143
I don't know.

39:52.372 --> 39:53.993
I really don't.

39:58.260 --> 40:02.162
Maybe we could get breakfast
tomorrow before you leave.

40:05.534 --> 40:07.033
Yeah.

40:27.093 --> 40:28.555
You came back.

40:31.226 --> 40:36.563
Biggest moment of my life...
June 6, 2007.

40:38.066 --> 40:40.457
I was playing on the USC baseball team.

40:41.603 --> 40:44.219
Bought a bacon burger
from this sassy freshman

40:44.239 --> 40:46.339
at the concession stand.

40:46.374 --> 40:48.175
I wasn't even hungry.

40:49.125 --> 40:53.246
I just bought it 'cause I wanted to talk

40:53.281 --> 40:55.448
to the prettiest girl I'd ever seen.

40:56.094 --> 40:59.742
What a coincidence.
That was my moment, too.

41:01.629 --> 41:03.489
So tell me everything.

41:04.025 --> 41:07.961
Well, um... Buster Posey was great.

41:07.996 --> 41:10.430
- Oh, was he nice?
- He was so nice.

41:10.465 --> 41:11.865
I did the little thing.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.933
- I touched my chain for you.
- I know, I saw it.

41:40.513 --> 41:41.628
Hello.

41:41.663 --> 41:44.211
Hear that? Hear what?

41:44.231 --> 41:46.070
Your home run just landed in Long Beach.

41:50.471 --> 41:52.431
Think I would have done
better with you out there.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.262
Couldn't have done any worse.

41:54.282 --> 41:56.755
Listen, old man, if your
bones weren't so brittle,

41:56.775 --> 41:58.491
I might be celebrating right now.

41:58.511 --> 42:01.530
You should still be celebrating.
You're an All-Star.

42:01.550 --> 42:05.350
You know how many people in the
history of the game can say that?

42:06.355 --> 42:07.914
You know what? I'll take that.

42:07.934 --> 42:09.142
Mmm.

42:11.098 --> 42:12.990
I heard what you said about me.

42:13.010 --> 42:15.814
On the air? I wasn't talking about you.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.934
I was talking about
the other female major-leaguer.

42:23.171 --> 42:26.539
How you doing with the
whole Mom-Kevin thing?

42:27.630 --> 42:28.908
All good.

42:30.135 --> 42:32.308
How are you doing with the whole

42:32.328 --> 42:34.347
catcher coming to take your job thing?

42:34.382 --> 42:37.150
I heard he starts in El Paso next week.

42:39.254 --> 42:40.353
All good.

42:43.214 --> 42:44.577
You still there?

42:45.247 --> 42:46.392
Yeah, I'm still here.

42:46.428 --> 42:47.881
Oh, okay.

42:47.901 --> 42:50.760
Sorry, I-I just thought
I lost you for a sec,

42:50.954 --> 42:52.465
but it must have been
from when that home run

42:52.500 --> 42:54.774
bounced off my satellite provider.

42:57.005 --> 42:58.705
You're not a good teammate.

42:59.212 --> 43:00.568
Never said I was.
