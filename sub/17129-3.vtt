ANGIE PICKED OUT THIS RING
I CAN'T AFFORD,

13:02.549 --> 13:04.617
AND SHE THINKS I'M GOING
TO GET IT FOR HER.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.888
GEORGE, A RING
MEANS NOTHING.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.424
I GAVE MY WIFE
A 3-KARAT STONE,

13:11.424 --> 13:14.527
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HER
FROM CHEATING ON ME.

13:14.527 --> 13:18.165
SHE EVEN THREW THE RING
AT ME DURING COUNSELING

13:18.165 --> 13:21.835
WHEN I CALLED HER A
MATTRESS-HOPPING, WHORE FROG.

13:25.105 --> 13:29.109
IN SPANISH,
THAT IS DEVASTATING.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.211
IT'S HORRIBLE WHEN
A MARRIAGE FALLS APART.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.213
HEY, DID YOU
KEEP THAT RING?

13:33.213 --> 13:37.450
I'M GONNA USE IT TO SCRATCH
"FORNICATOR" ON HER COFFIN.

13:37.450 --> 13:40.787
SO THE DEVIL KNOWS
WHICH LINE TO PUT HER IN.

13:40.787 --> 13:44.191
THAT RING OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT
OF BAD MEMORIES FOR YOU,

13:44.191 --> 13:46.426
BUT IF YOU GAVE IT TO ME,
AND I GIVE IT TO ANGIE,

13:46.426 --> 13:48.428
THAT WOULD MAKE
YOUR DAUGHTER HAPPY.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.130
THAT WOULD MAKE
A GOOD MEMORY.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.065
BUT, SHE WOULD KNOW
IT'S HER MOTHER'S RING.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.800
NO, NO, SHE WON'T.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.736
I'LL TAKE THE STONE --
I'LL PUT IT IN A NEW SETTING.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.405
HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,

13:58.405 --> 14:01.241
WE COULDN'T AFFORD A DECENT
WEDDING, AND YOU DIDN'T HELP US.

14:01.241 --> 14:05.078
THIS WOULD MAKE UP FOR THAT
A HUNDRED TIMES OVER.

14:11.118 --> 14:14.554
OKAY, GEORGE, BECAUSE IT WILL
MAKE MY DAUGHTER HAPPY,

14:14.554 --> 14:15.923
I WILL GIVE YOU THE RING.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.191
OH, MAN, THANKS VIC.
THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.928
AND, I WILL TAKE THE PUTTER,

14:20.928 --> 14:23.897
YOUR TABLE SAW,
AND YOUR POWER DRILL.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.667
DEAL.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.837
I'M NOT FINISHED.

14:30.837 --> 14:34.041
WHAT SIZE SHOE ARE YOU?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.582
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

14:42.582 --> 14:44.051
OH!

14:44.051 --> 14:45.785
THE RING'S HERE,
ISN'T IT?

14:45.785 --> 14:50.257
WHERE IS IT?

14:50.257 --> 14:53.160
YOU HID IT.
I KNOW YOU HID IT.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.628
I BET IT'S IN
ONE OF THE MUFFINS.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.869
THOSE ARE JUST MUFFINS.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.172
I'M KIND OF SCARED
TO TELL YOU

15:05.172 --> 15:08.108
THE RING'S IN MY
FRONT POCKET.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.012
[ GASPS ]

15:12.012 --> 15:15.582
IT'S MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I REMEMBER.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.217
GEORGE...

15:17.217 --> 15:19.619
THIS DIAMOND'S BIGGER.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.921
YES, IT IS.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.392
FOR ONCE, I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU MORE THAN
WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.072
I'LL GET YOU
SOME MORE MUFFINS.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.814
CHANGE OF PLANS.
DON'T GIVE HER THE RING.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.482
WHAT?
I JUST GAVE IT TO HER.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.485
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS
WAS ABOUT, THAT SHIRT?

15:54.354 --> 15:57.557
YOU GOT ME THIS
FOR CHRISTMAS.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:06.333 --> 16:09.202
WELL, LAST NIGHT I DID
SOMETHING VERY STUPID.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.304
I WENT TO HAPPY HOUR
AT BAJA BEACH,

16:11.304 --> 16:13.740
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY GOT
THOSE GIANT MARGARITAS.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.175
GET TO THE POINT.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.309
WELL, I WAS DRUNK.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.345
SO, I CALLED
ANGIE'S MOTHER

16:18.345 --> 16:21.281
AND TOLD HER I GAVE HER DIAMOND
TO A YOUNGER WOMAN.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.315
WHAT?!

16:22.315 --> 16:24.951
THE WHOLE BAR CHEERED
FOR ME, MAN.

16:24.951 --> 16:27.420
"WHORE FROG, WHORE FROG,
WHORE FROG."

16:27.420 --> 16:29.722
VIC!

16:29.722 --> 16:31.691
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.261
LEGALLY, THE RING IS HERS
FROM THE SETTLEMENT,

16:34.261 --> 16:35.962
AND SHE DEMANDED IT BACK.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.231
NO, MAN,
THE RING IS ANGIE'S NOW.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.367
TELL EMELINA YOU LOST IT --
THAT SOMEONE STOLE IT.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.236
IF I DON'T GET THAT RING
BACK TO EMELINA,

16:43.236 --> 16:46.273
I WILL HAVE
TO PAY HER $30,000.

16:46.273 --> 16:50.243
GOOD, YOU STAYED CALM.
YOU CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.279
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.447
IF YOU DON'T TELL HER,
I WILL HAVE TO.

16:54.447 --> 16:58.985
DADDY, YOU HAVE TO SEE
THE RING GEORGE GOT ME.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.720
HEY!

17:02.322 --> 17:04.957
LET ME SEE IT
IN THE LIGHT.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.527
OH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.597
I WILL TAKE IT TO GET
INSURED IMMEDIATELY.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.300
I JUST HOPE I DON'T
GET ROBBED ON THE WAY.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.704
NO! NOW, DADDY,
I JUST PUT IT ON.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.307
LOOK, YOU GOT
A BIG SMUDGE ON IT.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.974
I'LL CLEAN IT, HONEY.

17:22.974 --> 17:27.280
THE GUY IN THE STORE SAID JUST
A LITTLE SOAP AND WARM WATER

17:27.280 --> 17:29.849
BRINGS OUT THE NATURAL SHINE
FROM THE CENTER OF THE --

17:29.849 --> 17:31.351
[ CLINKING ]

17:31.351 --> 17:32.319
WHAT?

17:39.025 --> 17:40.360
OH, MY GOD.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.329
THE RING WENT DOWN
THE DRAIN, ANGIE,

17:42.329 --> 17:44.497
IT'LL GO DOWN
INTO THE SEWER!

17:44.497 --> 17:46.933
GET THE RING!

17:46.933 --> 17:49.669
THE RING'S GONE.

17:49.669 --> 17:53.473
ANGIE, IF ONLY YOU HAD
LISTENED TO YOUR FATHER

17:53.473 --> 17:56.676
AND GOTTEN THE INSURANCE!

17:56.676 --> 17:58.645
AY DIOS MIO!

17:58.645 --> 18:02.382
EMELINA'S GOING TO KILL ME,
YOU STUPID, STUPID MAN!

18:05.118 --> 18:07.187
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:07.187 --> 18:11.057
I GAVE GEORGE THE STONE
FROM YOUR MOTHER'S RING,

18:11.057 --> 18:13.226
AND NOW SHE WANTS IT BACK.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.563
GEORGE?

18:19.132 --> 18:21.968
THE RING WAS IN THE TRAP
UNDER THE SINK.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.737
I WAS GONNA
GET IT LATER!

18:30.477 --> 18:33.780
OH, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A GOOD PLAN.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.188
YOU ALWAYS FIND A WAY,
DON'T YOU?

18:41.188 --> 18:43.356
LOOK, ANGIE,
I WANTED TO GET YOU A RING,

18:43.356 --> 18:45.358
I JUST COULDN'T AFFORD
THE ONE YOU LIKED.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.794
THEN WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME THAT?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.897
ALL I EVER WANTED
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY

18:50.897 --> 18:55.468
WAS A SMALL GESTURE THAT SAYS
YOU STILL FEEL ABOUT ME NOW

18:55.468 --> 18:58.638
THE WAY YOU DID
WHEN WE FIRST GOT MARRIED.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.242
MAYBE WE CAN
STILL DO THAT, ANGIE.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.543

RENEW...OUR...VOWS.

LET'S RENEW OUR VOWS.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.904
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE WEDDING
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

19:31.904 --> 19:36.476
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.312
WE COULD
WRITE OUR OWN VOWS.

19:39.312 --> 19:43.283
AND FINALLY TAKE
THOSE DANCE LESSONS.

19:45.151 --> 19:48.288
