00:59.125 --> 01:01.240
Time passes. Seasons change.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.782
What actually is 'time'?

01:04.375 --> 01:08.282
If we could control time -
travel back and forth,

01:08.875 --> 01:12.490
could we then change fate
and rewrite history?

01:13.416 --> 01:16.657
Mankind has always explored
this riddle of time

01:17.375 --> 01:21.365
Scientists discovered that
time is actually speed

01:21.500 --> 01:23.824
If we could master the secrets of speed,

01:23.958 --> 01:25.615
then we could control time

01:25.833 --> 01:28.449
And thus control the past and the future

01:30.375 --> 01:32.782
Man devised technology
to break the sound barrier

01:33.708 --> 01:36.824
But even faster than sound - is light

01:36.916 --> 01:41.115
And so, we wait to see
how light-speed can be broken

01:41.708 --> 01:43.365
Will such future technology

01:43.458 --> 01:45.782
be rockets and spaceships?

01:45.916 --> 01:49.074
Or will it just be a program
developed on the internet?

01:49.583 --> 01:53.540
Remains of ancient civilizations
actually show us

01:53.541 --> 01:55.749
some did traverse space-time

01:55.750 --> 01:56.865
came to this world

01:58.541 --> 01:59.999
Mysteries of the ancients

02:00.000 --> 02:02.957
the pyramids, the heads on Easter Island,

02:02.958 --> 02:06.699
or the still-unexplained Mayan civilization

02:08.708 --> 02:12.199
And sages who could predict the future,

02:12.375 --> 02:16.907
were they cosmic travelers
who held the secrets to space-time?

02:18.750 --> 02:20.449
I can tell you now

02:21.083 --> 02:25.115
There really were those
who became time travelers.

02:26.666 --> 02:30.115
Because I am one of them

02:48.208 --> 02:50.740
Back then, the Ming empire was formidable

02:51.083 --> 02:54.115
I was one of the Emperor's elite guard

02:54.541 --> 02:56.407
I was born in 1591

02:57.000 --> 03:00.374
When I was ten,
Nurhaci united the Manchu banners,

03:00.375 --> 03:02.874
the Italian missionary
Matteo Ricci came to China

03:02.875 --> 03:07.124
I was drafted into the imperial court,
away from Taoyuan village and my people

03:07.125 --> 03:08.449
Away from my people

03:10.541 --> 03:13.449
I was then placed into a training camp
for the elite guard.

03:13.791 --> 03:15.782
Training was arduous,

03:16.958 --> 03:19.582
but that's how I met the friends
who'd die for each other

03:19.583 --> 03:20.540
Can you do it?

03:20.541 --> 03:21.574
Yes, we can!

03:25.583 --> 03:26.374
He Ying,

03:26.375 --> 03:29.249
what do you want do when you grow up?

03:29.250 --> 03:31.532
Me? I'm gonna be a real man -

03:31.708 --> 03:34.115
a servant of the court and a good son

03:34.541 --> 03:37.282
- That's it?
- Yep. What about you?

03:37.916 --> 03:40.282
I'll do something big

03:40.416 --> 03:42.949
so I don't waste the skills I've learned

03:43.500 --> 03:46.199
And you, Niehu? What's your dream?

03:47.625 --> 03:50.282
I want to marry a beautiful wife

03:50.333 --> 03:51.374
You wish

03:51.375 --> 03:53.374
Dream on

03:53.375 --> 03:55.240
What about you, Sao?

03:55.333 --> 03:57.199
Me? Let me think

03:57.708 --> 04:00.290
I want a giant chicken leg,

04:00.291 --> 04:02.865
a drumstick so big, I'll never finish it

04:03.333 --> 04:05.957
You're hopeless!

04:05.958 --> 04:09.240
It's always about food!

04:10.833 --> 04:12.332
"1624 AD"

04:12.333 --> 04:14.624
The four of us were sent out west

04:14.625 --> 04:17.365
I never expected that expedition
would change my life

04:18.041 --> 04:18.915
Shall we?

04:18.916 --> 04:19.916
Let's go!

04:25.083 --> 04:26.874
I met a holy monk

04:26.875 --> 04:29.574
He bestowed on me the secret to time travel

04:30.416 --> 04:33.699
Can you swear on your life

04:34.041 --> 04:39.324
that you will never reveal
the chant that starts the orb?

04:39.416 --> 04:42.074
That monk had me deliver
the orb to the capital

04:43.958 --> 04:46.032
But the Emperor was young
and neglected his duties

04:47.833 --> 04:51.032
I don't think we should give him the Linga

04:51.083 --> 04:52.949
For the sake of the people,

04:53.625 --> 04:56.199
I will forever guard the the orb's secret

04:56.750 --> 04:58.699
Deceiving the Emperor could cost your head

04:59.500 --> 05:00.500
For you

05:00.583 --> 05:01.583
Alright

05:04.416 --> 05:07.157
This almost cost me my life
four hundred years later

05:07.583 --> 05:09.407
That was a catastrophe

05:10.208 --> 05:12.782
Or should I call it a conspiracy

05:23.416 --> 05:27.199
From the western reaches,
I bring back this sacred orb!

05:27.250 --> 05:30.740
Long live the Emperor!

05:31.625 --> 05:33.532
Please slow down, Your Highness

05:34.500 --> 05:38.074
This western campaign has
wrought great rewards,

05:38.250 --> 05:41.032
but why has General He Ying not returned?

05:41.416 --> 05:43.124
Eunuch Wei,

05:43.125 --> 05:47.657
Japanese pirates and
Jurchen forces lurk at our borders

05:47.833 --> 05:51.665
Generals He and Sao received word en route

05:51.666 --> 05:54.782
and voluntarily set off to fight them

05:55.083 --> 05:56.657
That pleases me greatly

05:57.083 --> 05:58.665
Especially this golden orb

05:58.666 --> 06:00.249
It is the work of the gods

06:00.250 --> 06:03.032
Put it in the treasure stores
so that I can toy with it!

06:04.916 --> 06:08.699
General Yuanlong, is there some way
to operate this orb?

06:09.333 --> 06:11.865
It requires something called a Linga.

06:11.958 --> 06:13.240
He Ying has it

06:13.333 --> 06:16.615
This orb has the power
to alter time and space

06:18.541 --> 06:20.407
Are you telling me everything?

06:20.625 --> 06:24.199
As your ally, I of course
would conceal nothing

06:26.125 --> 06:30.290
But you are destined to
suffer great calamity

06:30.291 --> 06:31.124
What calamity?

06:31.125 --> 06:36.282
Life becomes death.
Death becomes life. In three cycles

06:36.750 --> 06:40.365
By Heaven's authority, the Emperor decrees

06:40.791 --> 06:46.199
He Ying has failed him,
colluding with pirates,

06:46.541 --> 06:50.324
and slaughtering
Justice Minister Du's entire family

06:50.666 --> 06:52.574
I have been honest and true all my life

06:52.625 --> 06:55.324
I could not possibly commit such murders!

06:56.833 --> 06:59.324
The Emperor has ordered
your whole clan's execution!

08:00.041 --> 08:02.990
That was the avalanche that buried us

08:03.250 --> 08:04.865
When we awoke,

08:04.916 --> 08:06.457
it was to a world hundreds of years later

08:06.458 --> 08:11.365
"Route 3, Hong Kong"

08:13.000 --> 08:15.124
An illicit businessman
smuggling national treasures

08:15.125 --> 08:18.824
brought Niehu, Sao, and
me down to Hong Kong

08:18.848 --> 08:28.948
<b>W w W . Z O C i N E . C  O M

08:35.750 --> 08:38.323
I met many strange people

08:38.541 --> 08:40.240
They said I was from the past

08:42.582 --> 08:45.032
At first, I couldn't believe it

08:45.125 --> 08:48.490
But everything here was so unimaginable,

08:48.541 --> 08:50.115
it wasn't a matter of believing

08:51.041 --> 08:52.240
Luckily, she was at my side,

08:53.583 --> 08:58.032
helping me understand what to me was a
totally unfamiliar world of the future

09:06.875 --> 09:09.074
And yet I never expected

09:09.208 --> 09:11.199
that my three best friends

09:11.208 --> 09:13.074
would be here as well

09:24.750 --> 09:26.332
Four hundred years later,

09:26.333 --> 09:27.707
they still believed

09:27.708 --> 09:31.240
I was an ungrateful traitor
who abandoned the Ming empire

09:33.833 --> 09:35.582
Even more unexpected

09:35.583 --> 09:38.907
was that their pursuit
would paralyze all of Hong Kong

09:44.125 --> 09:47.032
And that is how I fell into the sea

09:48.583 --> 09:49.957
At that moment,

09:49.958 --> 09:53.199
I thought I had left the world for good

09:54.041 --> 09:56.457
Thus is your fate

09:56.458 --> 09:58.990
and thus is the test Heaven hath given

10:00.791 --> 10:02.999
Should you pass this adversity,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.115
you will reach another plane

10:36.666 --> 10:38.040
Inspector! Inspector!

10:38.041 --> 10:39.540
About the chaos at the bridge
caused by the strange men,

10:39.541 --> 10:41.082
does the police have any comment?

10:41.083 --> 10:42.532
Can you tell us anything?

10:50.833 --> 10:54.040
Sir, we got the one from the ocean and
took him to the morgue

10:54.041 --> 10:55.699
Be right there

10:55.958 --> 10:57.865
There's another one held in solitary

10:59.250 --> 11:01.865
I just checked. He still has a pulse

11:22.583 --> 11:24.032
Niehu

11:24.083 --> 11:26.615
Boss!

11:31.000 --> 11:32.615
Eat something

11:33.750 --> 11:35.790
If everything you say is true,

11:35.791 --> 11:37.624
then I say write a book

11:37.625 --> 11:39.165
Write it all down.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.657
It ought to do better
than that Palace series

11:43.791 --> 11:46.782
- He's still alive.
- What do you mean?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.790
I have to find him

11:49.791 --> 11:52.157
Where would you look?

11:58.750 --> 12:01.332
Police are still investigating
the bizarre events at the bridge,

12:01.333 --> 12:03.957
but have declined further comment

12:03.958 --> 12:06.707
The deputy inspector of this case

12:06.708 --> 12:08.249
has been missing for several days

12:08.250 --> 12:11.332
and is a suspect in
an officer's death in the morgue

12:11.333 --> 12:13.657
Police have ordered his arrest

12:15.125 --> 12:16.915
Sao isn't important to us

12:16.916 --> 12:19.157
Only He Ying knows the chant

12:19.708 --> 12:22.615
Help me find the orb.
It's the only way back

12:23.833 --> 12:25.415
Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine

12:25.416 --> 12:27.074
Yuanlong would be the one to save me

12:27.625 --> 12:30.449
The execution of the Minister's family
was really a setup

12:30.916 --> 12:33.574
My brothers finally realized
they had me all wrong

12:34.458 --> 12:36.707
But with all of Hong Kong looking for me,

12:36.708 --> 12:38.990
I had to completely change my look

12:42.666 --> 12:44.665
To save my mother and my village,

12:44.666 --> 12:46.540
I had to change history

12:46.541 --> 12:48.740
But first I needed to find May

12:49.375 --> 12:51.199
She had to be worried about me

12:52.041 --> 12:54.999
So he got here before you did

12:55.000 --> 12:57.040
and now he's even some kind of

12:57.041 --> 12:59.165
assistant police chief?

12:59.166 --> 13:00.874
If he hadn't intervened to save me,

13:00.875 --> 13:02.032
I would've been a goner

13:04.041 --> 13:05.665
Hey, you cut your hair

13:05.666 --> 13:07.907
That's right, I did

13:08.083 --> 13:10.365
Because I needed a fresh start

13:13.250 --> 13:16.249
May, I really must thank you

13:16.250 --> 13:19.240
for looking after me all this time

13:19.875 --> 13:21.699
You noticed

13:21.708 --> 13:23.949
So what are your plans?

13:25.291 --> 13:28.907
Actually... I came to say goodbye

13:30.375 --> 13:32.240
You're going back to the Ming era?

13:33.583 --> 13:34.949
How is that possible?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.615
Yuanlong found the orb!

13:38.416 --> 13:39.615
He found the orb!

13:57.416 --> 13:59.449
Hey, why don't we take a selfie?

14:26.791 --> 14:28.365
The times have moved on

14:28.958 --> 14:31.324
The old hutongs are all gone

14:31.666 --> 14:34.365
Now they're all these
strange, tall buildings

14:36.041 --> 14:37.240
Let me use your phone

14:40.250 --> 14:41.574
You have friends in Beijing?

14:43.166 --> 14:46.407
How could I have friends
in a place like this?

14:47.916 --> 14:49.240
But I've got one in Hong Kong

15:00.958 --> 15:03.740
"At the capital, don't worry"

15:15.666 --> 15:19.449
The Emperor was young
and Eunuch Wei ran amok

15:20.625 --> 15:22.907
He died after a six year reign

15:24.000 --> 15:27.699
Chongzhen ascended. He fought the tide,

15:28.125 --> 15:29.490
but the dynasty was doomed

15:31.583 --> 15:32.990
This is the Ming Mausoleum

15:34.375 --> 15:37.115
Thirteen of the Emperors are buried here

15:42.666 --> 15:47.490
"A country falls, the land remains.
The city in spring, green grows thick"

15:54.250 --> 15:56.240
Look at the Forbidden City of today

15:56.625 --> 15:58.199
Back then, no one could enter

15:58.333 --> 16:01.574
Now, anyone who buys a ticket can go in

16:02.333 --> 16:05.740
How were you able to
find the orb in the palace?

16:08.333 --> 16:11.782
It was in the northwest
treasure room all along

16:12.166 --> 16:14.074
At the end of the Qing dynasty,

16:14.291 --> 16:16.199
a great fire struck the treasure stores

16:16.416 --> 16:19.115
Eunuchs smuggled it out during the chaos

16:19.250 --> 16:22.490
It's been out among the people, ever since

16:37.458 --> 16:39.657
You and He Ying owe your trip to Hong Kong

16:39.666 --> 16:40.949
entirely to these guys

16:41.791 --> 16:42.874
Mister Deng!

16:42.875 --> 16:45.574
Mister high-level, Hong Kong, fugitive cop!

16:45.791 --> 16:47.532
"Beijing welcomes you!"

16:48.458 --> 16:51.157
Beijing is your turf. You've got your ways

16:51.958 --> 16:54.157
That thing from last time - did you do it?

16:54.333 --> 16:56.282
When I'm on the case, you can relax

16:57.791 --> 16:58.990
Here you go

17:04.625 --> 17:05.824
That's where it is

17:10.290 --> 17:12.656
Even a fighter as talented as Yuan Chengzhi

17:12.790 --> 17:15.615
at last had to flee far away

17:15.833 --> 17:17.031
The fall of the Ming dynasty

17:17.165 --> 17:18.365
was a foregone conclusion

17:26.583 --> 17:27.781
Where's Niehu?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.407
Dealing with something in town

17:30.166 --> 17:34.699
He'll meet back with us later at the cave

18:27.166 --> 18:28.449
Truly a divine creation

18:28.458 --> 18:31.907
Hundreds of years and yet still flawless

18:32.375 --> 18:33.740
How is it activated?

18:35.875 --> 18:38.657
The orb is made of two companion parts

18:39.000 --> 18:42.365
With the Linga inserted
and the chant spoken,

18:43.875 --> 18:45.240
it should start working

18:46.416 --> 18:47.749
Do you still remember the chant?

18:47.750 --> 18:48.999
Of course

18:49.000 --> 18:50.574
Then there's no time to lose

18:51.208 --> 18:53.365
The four of us were
trapped in ice for centuries

18:53.416 --> 18:55.207
If we leave, we should leave together

18:55.208 --> 18:58.699
If it can really make time travel possible,

18:58.916 --> 19:00.832
we can go first, then come back for them

19:00.833 --> 19:01.957
No way

19:01.958 --> 19:04.040
Defying nature cannot be taken so lightly

19:04.041 --> 19:04.957
We're out of time

19:04.958 --> 19:06.532
- Boss!
- There he is

19:07.041 --> 19:08.490
I'm here. Let's go

19:08.625 --> 19:09.824
Where's Sao?

19:14.166 --> 19:15.365
He Ying,

19:15.583 --> 19:18.199
Hong Kong police found Sao's body yesterday

19:18.416 --> 19:20.449
He's not coming back with us

19:21.541 --> 19:22.740
What?

19:23.666 --> 19:24.457
He's dead?

19:24.458 --> 19:25.832
Enough waiting. There's no more time

19:25.833 --> 19:28.115
Yuanlong! ls Sao dead?

19:29.541 --> 19:31.624
He's gone! What are you waiting for?

19:31.625 --> 19:33.165
If he's dead, I still want to see the body!

19:33.166 --> 19:35.824
Everyone is looking for the three of us!

19:37.666 --> 19:40.874
This is the modern world.
We can't stay here!

19:40.875 --> 19:43.124
You want to go back to Hong Kong
to see the girl, right?

19:43.125 --> 19:44.324
What was that?

19:55.375 --> 19:56.574
May!

19:59.041 --> 19:59.832
Had you worked with me,

19:59.833 --> 20:00.907
He Ying!

20:00.916 --> 20:02.199
I wouldn't have resorted to this

20:06.208 --> 20:08.699
- We're brothers
- You're naive, He Ying

20:10.666 --> 20:12.415
Since we found the device

20:12.416 --> 20:13.582
we should make good use of it

20:13.583 --> 20:16.240
I've waited eighteen
years, just for this day

20:17.000 --> 20:20.324
With this orb, the world is mine

20:23.291 --> 20:24.332
I have no words

20:24.333 --> 20:25.957
Tell me what the chant is

20:25.958 --> 20:27.199
or I shoot her dead

20:39.458 --> 20:40.657
The chant!

20:42.208 --> 20:44.657
The chant, spit it out!

20:51.875 --> 20:54.374
God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva

20:54.375 --> 20:56.407
The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva...

20:56.431 --> 21:08.331
<b>W w W . Z O C i N E . C  O M

21:19.708 --> 21:21.199
I'm going, too!

21:32.875 --> 21:35.324
You can stay. See you later!

22:13.666 --> 22:14.865
You okay?

22:37.166 --> 22:38.365
Let's go

22:43.291 --> 22:44.449
Well, we can't get out

22:56.375 --> 23:00.032
Hey, why did you come out here?

23:00.458 --> 23:05.499
Back home, the news said
they found one of you

23:05.500 --> 23:07.040
I was so worried about you

23:07.041 --> 23:08.624
Today, two fishermen

23:08.625 --> 23:11.865
discovered a bloated body out
on the Gold Coast.

23:12.041 --> 23:13.865
The dead man's identity is unclear

23:13.875 --> 23:16.574
Police have not yet commented on the matter

23:18.125 --> 23:21.074
"Come to the capital, quickly"

23:26.583 --> 23:28.074
Niehu captured me

23:28.875 --> 23:30.865
I didn't expect to see you here

23:31.833 --> 23:33.449
I've brought you trouble yet again

23:35.000 --> 23:39.282
No. I'm the one who brought it to you

23:39.500 --> 23:40.957
If not for me,

23:40.958 --> 23:44.157
you wouldn't have used
the chant to start the orb

24:16.750 --> 24:18.032
Damn you!

24:25.166 --> 24:26.365
I'm sorry

24:31.458 --> 24:33.782
I may not have a job

24:35.583 --> 24:37.240
or even any family,

24:38.083 --> 24:39.749
but since the day we met,

24:39.750 --> 24:41.657
I haven't regret a thing

24:50.375 --> 24:51.907
Truly no regrets?

24:52.958 --> 24:54.574
Then that's a good thing

24:55.416 --> 24:56.615
Come

24:58.958 --> 25:00.082
see that?

25:00.083 --> 25:01.449
Never give up hope

25:01.500 --> 25:03.032
LINGA is over there

25:06.041 --> 25:07.415
God mandates the Bodhisattva Mahasattva

25:07.416 --> 25:08.976
The Emperor mandates the Bodhisattva...

25:42.333 --> 25:43.615
Let me help you

25:46.166 --> 25:47.657
Get up

25:48.083 --> 25:49.907
This is an inspection!

25:51.041 --> 25:52.240
What's going on?

25:52.958 --> 25:53.999
Looks like they mean business

25:54.000 --> 25:55.115
Don't make them angry

26:10.416 --> 26:11.416
No!

26:14.708 --> 26:17.249
Excuse me, what year is it?

26:17.250 --> 26:19.532
The sixteenth year of the Republic

26:22.833 --> 26:25.657
He Ying!

26:27.708 --> 26:29.249
We arrived in the 'Republic'.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.707
- You know it?
- The Republic?

26:30.708 --> 26:32.665
- When was the Republic?
- After the Ming

26:32.666 --> 26:33.749
That's them!

26:33.750 --> 26:34.832
What do you want!

26:34.833 --> 26:35.990
None of your business!

26:36.291 --> 26:37.207
Grab them!

26:37.208 --> 26:38.490
Stay out of this!

26:39.708 --> 26:41.499
Don't give it to them!

26:41.500 --> 26:42.657
Take her away!

26:43.166 --> 26:44.540
Down with warmongers!

26:44.541 --> 26:46.074
How dare you!

26:46.166 --> 26:47.449
Let her go!

26:48.041 --> 26:49.532
Down with warmongers!

26:51.375 --> 26:53.499
Jap bastards strutting on Chinese soil

26:53.500 --> 26:54.124
Hand it over!

26:54.125 --> 26:55.907
In broad daylight?!

26:56.041 --> 26:57.240
I will not stand for this!

26:57.666 --> 26:59.865
I'm gonna kill you!

27:01.041 --> 27:02.441
Attacking a woman? I'll murder you!

27:07.583 --> 27:09.865
Die!

27:10.083 --> 27:12.115
Okay, that's enough

27:16.583 --> 27:17.782
Jap bastard

27:19.166 --> 27:20.324
Bring backup!

27:20.375 --> 27:22.449
Outta the way!

27:23.208 --> 27:24.532
Don't be frightened

27:25.291 --> 27:26.865
You could take on ten of them

27:32.583 --> 27:33.782
Bring it on!

27:36.833 --> 27:38.532
Let's get her!

28:15.875 --> 28:17.165
Get out of China!

28:17.166 --> 28:19.657
Quit staring! Let's get out of here!

28:29.166 --> 28:30.540
This is from the Japanese Prime Minister

28:30.541 --> 28:32.949
It details a plan for their emperor

28:33.375 --> 28:36.074
Brave young people risked
their lives to steal it

28:36.125 --> 28:37.957
We were tasked to bring it back

28:37.958 --> 28:40.990
and alert everyone,
so they might stand and fight Japan

28:41.458 --> 28:44.990
You two are the real heroes

28:45.000 --> 28:47.949
Allow me to pay you my respect

28:48.666 --> 28:51.082
We would be honored to know your names

28:51.083 --> 28:53.740
Yes, everyone should know of your decency

28:54.291 --> 28:55.407
We are...

28:56.041 --> 28:57.240
visitors

28:58.791 --> 28:59.990
Take care

29:00.458 --> 29:03.115
It was through a freak set of circumstances

29:03.125 --> 29:06.449
that this trip took us back to 1927

29:06.541 --> 29:10.199
The document they guarded
was the Tanaka Plan,

29:10.875 --> 29:12.582
It advised their emperor that
conquering the world

29:12.583 --> 29:15.540
meant conquering China

29:15.541 --> 29:18.449
To take China, they must
first take Manchuria

29:18.750 --> 29:20.624
The exposure of this document

29:20.625 --> 29:23.699
delayed Japanese invasion by ten years

29:30.458 --> 29:31.657
Let's go!

29:56.166 --> 29:58.615
Holy monk... why are you here?

29:58.791 --> 30:02.990
Seasons depart and return.
Finally, so have you

30:04.750 --> 30:06.490
How do I save my people?

30:08.416 --> 30:11.082
Once the major planets align,

30:11.083 --> 30:13.949
your life will see its greatest change

30:14.708 --> 30:16.832
Cause and effect

30:16.833 --> 30:20.449
Those hang upon you now

30:21.041 --> 30:22.824
No matter the price,

30:23.875 --> 30:25.782
I will pay it to save my family

30:29.000 --> 30:33.782
Behind you are two roads
back to your village

30:33.958 --> 30:37.532
One on the left, the other on the right

30:37.666 --> 30:41.782
As paths differ, so do outcomes

30:54.791 --> 30:55.907
Do I go to the left or...

30:58.083 --> 30:59.282
to the right?

31:49.375 --> 31:50.574
He Ying!

31:52.416 --> 31:55.124
Where are you?

31:55.125 --> 31:56.324
May!

32:02.666 --> 32:06.074
He Ying, where are we now?

32:06.541 --> 32:08.240
We're back in the Ming

32:08.458 --> 32:09.990
Really?

32:10.875 --> 32:12.824
Get on. We're going to Tao Yuan village

32:23.250 --> 32:29.615
Desolation abounds The corrupt hold power.
Thieves run rampant

32:33.041 --> 32:34.657
What's your plan?

32:35.708 --> 32:38.824
A man of character must do four things

32:38.916 --> 32:41.699
First, we must protect our land,

32:41.791 --> 32:42.990
our households,

32:43.583 --> 32:45.782
our brothers,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.199
and our women and children

32:47.541 --> 32:49.532
Then my conscience will be clear

33:08.833 --> 33:13.365
Halt! Hold it!

33:13.375 --> 33:14.574
Who goes there!

33:14.875 --> 33:17.540
It's He Ying!

33:17.541 --> 33:18.865
He Ying!

33:19.166 --> 33:20.365
He Ying!

33:20.750 --> 33:22.740
Da Zhi, I'm so happy

33:23.958 --> 33:26.540
Brother He, your hair...

33:26.541 --> 33:28.407
I went out west

33:28.458 --> 33:31.157
Men out there all wear it like this

33:31.500 --> 33:32.865
Pretty convenient!

33:34.625 --> 33:35.824
It's so good you're back

33:36.958 --> 33:38.449
He Ying's come back!

33:39.916 --> 33:41.749
He Ying has come back!

33:41.750 --> 33:44.949
Everyone! He Ying has come back!

33:45.833 --> 33:48.499
Brother He!

33:48.500 --> 33:50.074
He's returned!

33:51.333 --> 33:52.532
My son!

33:56.333 --> 33:57.999
Look out, look out!

33:58.000 --> 33:59.199
How have you been?

34:00.458 --> 34:01.749
- Son!
- Mom!

34:01.750 --> 34:03.240
You're finally back!

34:04.041 --> 34:05.240
I am

34:07.375 --> 34:10.324
It's so good to have you back

34:11.250 --> 34:12.998
You've been gone ten years

34:13.000 --> 34:15.331
Son, why does it seem like

34:15.333 --> 34:18.165
you've changed so much?

34:18.166 --> 34:20.165
Yeah, his... his hair

34:20.166 --> 34:22.532
Right, let me explain

34:22.625 --> 34:24.040
The westerners like the convenience.

34:24.041 --> 34:25.989
Out w-w-west.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.706
Look, Jade's been so
worried for your return

34:27.708 --> 34:30.748
that she's thought of nothing else

34:30.750 --> 34:31.831
Long time no see.

34:31.833 --> 34:32.873
Brother He!

34:32.875 --> 34:34.199
Stand a little closer!

34:34.708 --> 34:36.206
Don't be embarrassed

34:36.208 --> 34:37.739
You're no strangers

34:38.791 --> 34:39.456
And this is?

34:39.458 --> 34:40.657
May...

34:41.291 --> 34:42.782
This is Miss May

34:42.833 --> 34:44.032
Say hello

34:44.250 --> 34:45.989
How do you do, auntie

34:46.083 --> 34:48.831
Welcome to our village, Miss May

34:48.833 --> 34:49.915
Yes, welcome!

34:49.916 --> 34:52.456
So tonight, let's all make dumplings!

34:52.458 --> 34:54.739
Yeah!

34:58.083 --> 34:59.957
Food will be ready soon. Don't you worry

34:59.958 --> 35:01.157
Smell

35:01.250 --> 35:01.957
So fragrant

35:01.958 --> 35:02.832
Isn't it?

35:02.833 --> 35:04.615
It's fennel.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.782
Fennel, like 'final'

35:06.916 --> 35:08.999
so when you have fennel dumplings,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.657
you'll finally remember to come home, son

35:13.041 --> 35:13.874
Does it fit?

35:13.875 --> 35:15.032
Un

35:16.875 --> 35:18.165
What are you doing here?

35:18.166 --> 35:19.290
We want to see your challenger

35:19.291 --> 35:19.915
Yeah

35:19.916 --> 35:21.115
Watch your tongue

35:23.416 --> 35:24.874
- Hi
- Hello

35:24.875 --> 35:26.074
What's this?

35:26.541 --> 35:27.707
My bag

35:27.708 --> 35:29.532
it has things I normally use

35:30.041 --> 35:31.040
What is this stuff?

35:31.041 --> 35:32.457
What's this for?

35:32.458 --> 35:33.207
It's a Rubik's Cube

35:33.208 --> 35:34.582
A Rubik's what?

35:34.583 --> 35:36.082
It's for training your brain

35:36.083 --> 35:37.657
I need that

35:38.208 --> 35:39.082
And this?

35:39.083 --> 35:41.449
This... is perfume

35:42.500 --> 35:43.699
Come closer

35:45.583 --> 35:46.782
smells nice

35:47.958 --> 35:49.499
Together, rock-paper-scissors

35:49.500 --> 35:51.790
One, two, three, rock, paper, scissors!

35:51.791 --> 35:54.874
Yay, you won, you won!

35:54.875 --> 35:55.915
Dumplings are best with

35:55.916 --> 35:58.699
vinegar, soy, and sesame oil

35:58.708 --> 36:02.282
He Ying told me the same thing, too

36:04.875 --> 36:05.957
That's right

36:05.958 --> 36:06.957
Everyone

36:06.958 --> 36:08.324
let's raise our drinks

36:08.958 --> 36:10.707
and give He Ying a proper welcome!

36:10.708 --> 36:14.199
- Let's drink!
- Bottoms up!

36:19.416 --> 36:20.615
Don't drink so much

36:24.666 --> 36:25.865
Over here

36:25.889 --> 36:36.889
<b>W w W . Z O C i N E . C  O M

36:49.166 --> 36:51.074
It's okay, steady now

36:51.625 --> 36:56.032
Don't worry

37:11.625 --> 37:14.415
Miss May, you can take the bed tonight

37:14.416 --> 37:15.615
That's okay

37:16.208 --> 37:18.990
I'll be fine over here. It's nice

37:19.500 --> 37:21.740
It's alright, come

37:25.750 --> 37:29.865
I promised He Ying I'd
take good care of you

37:40.958 --> 37:44.907
When I have things on my mind
and can't sleep, I eat this

37:50.458 --> 37:51.949
you try some

37:52.833 --> 37:54.032
Thank you

38:01.208 --> 38:02.532
It's delicious.

38:03.250 --> 38:04.740
What's it called?

38:07.791 --> 38:09.324
Um... the future

38:12.083 --> 38:13.282
The future?

38:16.416 --> 38:20.157
The future is so sweet. It's delicious

38:20.500 --> 38:21.699
The future is sweet

38:24.916 --> 38:27.657
And one day, the future will be finished

38:36.208 --> 38:39.490
With all in disarray,
the Ming dynasty could not last

38:40.500 --> 38:42.490
To prevent my village from being destroyed,

38:42.791 --> 38:46.032
I'd have to follow Yuan Chengzhi's example

38:46.583 --> 38:49.074
and take my people out
west as soon as possible

38:53.333 --> 38:57.157
Ever thought you might sit there one day?

38:57.500 --> 39:00.907
Impossible. That's the Emperor's throne

39:01.291 --> 39:04.532
We were able to go 400
years back into the past

39:05.166 --> 39:06.332
How couldn't it be possible?

39:06.333 --> 39:08.824
As long as we make good use of the orb,

39:09.541 --> 39:11.240
the world will belong to us

39:11.791 --> 39:14.249
Everything in the universe, for all time,

39:14.250 --> 39:15.990
is soon in our grasp

39:20.250 --> 39:21.790
But He Ying still has the Linga

39:21.791 --> 39:23.207
that activates it

39:23.208 --> 39:24.790
He'll be back for

39:24.791 --> 39:26.490
sure to save his village

39:32.250 --> 39:33.949
I grew up here

39:36.041 --> 39:37.415
I wouldn't want to leave, and at some point

39:37.416 --> 39:40.574
I'd need to settle down

39:41.375 --> 39:42.574
Good

39:42.833 --> 39:46.290
Jade, she's been hoping for that

39:46.291 --> 39:47.490
Here

39:48.083 --> 39:51.324
I drink to you, brother-in-law

39:51.916 --> 39:53.115
Da Zhi,

39:53.916 --> 39:55.115
there's something...

39:56.083 --> 39:57.949
I want to discuss with
you, the village leader

39:58.625 --> 40:00.124
If I can call you brother

40:00.125 --> 40:01.749
then say what you have to say

40:01.750 --> 40:03.199
Here goes

40:03.291 --> 40:08.074
I want to take everyone in the village

40:08.291 --> 40:11.365
And move them. To someplace far away!

40:11.958 --> 40:13.157
You're drunk

40:13.500 --> 40:14.665
Listen to me

40:14.666 --> 40:15.624
You're really drunk!

40:15.625 --> 40:19.999
Our whole village is soon
going to be executed!

40:20.000 --> 40:22.832
Executed? We haven't done anything wrong

40:22.833 --> 40:24.615
why would we be executed?

40:24.833 --> 40:26.665
You're drunk. Really drunk

40:26.666 --> 40:28.026
I'm not listening to your nonsense

40:28.083 --> 40:29.282
I'm leaving.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.665
You go sleep it off.
I'm going there to keep watch

40:31.666 --> 40:32.665
Da Zhi!

40:32.666 --> 40:34.990
- Yeah, yeah, stop calling my name
- Hey!

40:35.000 --> 40:36.907
Listen to me!

40:44.458 --> 40:45.949
How does it feel?

40:47.083 --> 40:48.665
It's really damp

40:48.666 --> 40:50.240
Hey, not so loud

40:52.750 --> 40:56.082
Could you...

40:56.083 --> 40:58.124
tell me how you met He Ying?

40:58.125 --> 40:59.324
Yeah

41:03.791 --> 41:07.074
I used to work at a bar

41:07.333 --> 41:12.282
Wait, no. I worked at a winery

41:14.125 --> 41:16.407
Bad people would always come

41:16.666 --> 41:19.865
Luckily, He Ying came to the rescue

41:19.916 --> 41:20.790
Yeah,

41:20.791 --> 41:24.657
that's just the kind of heroic thing that
only our He Ying is able to do

41:26.541 --> 41:29.615
Then how is it you came back here together?

41:31.416 --> 41:34.074
You're not thinking of
stealing him, are you?

41:34.166 --> 41:35.824
Quiet, you.

41:35.958 --> 41:37.990
Our Jade is so gentle and true,

41:38.125 --> 41:41.032
He Ying, would never fall for someone else

41:49.583 --> 41:51.665
Tao Yuan celebrates

41:51.666 --> 41:54.949
Chuan and Hua Niu!

41:57.583 --> 42:00.115
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

42:02.375 --> 42:05.240
Now to your parents!

42:06.583 --> 42:09.115
Ladies and gentlemen!

42:09.333 --> 42:11.540
On this happy day for Hua Niu and me,

42:11.541 --> 42:14.990
I stand here and drink to you all!

42:16.750 --> 42:17.949
Chuan!

42:20.458 --> 42:24.115
Sao?

42:24.458 --> 42:25.499
Hey, Sao came back!

42:25.500 --> 42:27.457
Sao is back, too?

42:27.458 --> 42:29.874
You've finally come back!

42:29.875 --> 42:31.999
When I heard you were getting married,
I took leave

42:32.000 --> 42:34.249
Didn't expect to be late and
miss the formalities

42:34.250 --> 42:35.290
So it didn't count. Do it over!

42:35.291 --> 42:36.782
Go on, do it over!

42:36.833 --> 42:37.907
It's great you're back.

42:38.833 --> 42:40.032
Let's drink!

42:41.500 --> 42:43.199
He Ying!

42:48.500 --> 42:49.699
Brother He!

42:56.083 --> 42:57.540
What a guy.

42:57.541 --> 42:58.582
How did you get here before me?

42:58.583 --> 42:59.782
Do you like Hong Kong?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.415
- Gong gong?
- No

43:03.416 --> 43:05.240
No, it's a foreign tongue. From the west.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.707
It means I really missed you

43:07.708 --> 43:10.074
I missed you, too, brother!

43:11.458 --> 43:12.540
Drink up, come on!

43:12.541 --> 43:13.740
Sao...

43:14.458 --> 43:15.657
Not an easy thing

43:15.875 --> 43:17.074
rushing back from so far off

43:17.333 --> 43:19.449
You know it, brother

43:20.833 --> 43:21.999
Actually, I came back

43:22.000 --> 43:23.865
together with Minister Du

43:24.583 --> 43:25.782
Minister Du?

43:26.291 --> 43:28.082
He expressly wanted me to invite you

43:28.083 --> 43:30.490
to a feast tomorrow night at his home

43:31.291 --> 43:32.740
And Brother Yuanlong will be there

43:33.541 --> 43:35.615
Inviting me to the Minister's house?

43:38.583 --> 43:40.365
Hear this well!

43:41.791 --> 43:44.457
If the Du clan isn't killed off,

43:44.458 --> 43:46.032
I won't be wrongly accused,

43:47.083 --> 43:49.907
and Tao Yuan village can avoid a disaster

43:51.583 --> 43:53.199
There is a cause for everything

43:53.833 --> 43:56.574
History will change tomorrow night

43:59.416 --> 44:01.824
Brother, General Hojo has arrived

44:02.291 --> 44:05.949
Long time no see, General Yuanlong!

44:07.458 --> 44:11.165
Ever since Tokugawa
eliminated the Hideyoshi,

44:11.166 --> 44:13.374
the era of warring states
was essentially over

44:13.375 --> 44:15.532
My clan was once grand,

44:15.583 --> 44:17.707
but we've had to lay low,

44:17.708 --> 44:19.365
waiting for an opportunity

44:19.958 --> 44:23.907
since the Edo bakufu has General Hojo,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.240
it's no wonder
your nation's power keeps growing

44:26.291 --> 44:29.407
I sailed here this time

44:30.291 --> 44:33.082
in hope of receiving support
from the Ming court,

44:33.083 --> 44:36.824
especially that of your strength, General.

44:37.708 --> 44:40.324
If you could extend a helping hand,

44:40.625 --> 44:44.407
then the Hojo clan has hope for a revival

44:46.041 --> 44:48.707
Don't you worry. So long as you're my ally,

44:48.708 --> 44:51.240
I will help you banish the Tokugawa

44:51.625 --> 44:53.699
and help you rebuild

44:54.416 --> 44:56.865
If so, then I thank you

Hey, how does my hair look?

Looks good!

Like yours!

45:47.166 --> 45:48.365
Looks damn good!

45:50.666 --> 45:51.749
Did something on your mind

45:51.750 --> 45:53.532
bring you up here?

Sao

45:58.833 --> 46:00.324
help me protect the village, okay?

46:01.333 --> 46:02.532
Protect it? Why?

46:03.375 --> 46:05.157
To guard against bandits

46:06.166 --> 46:07.907
sure! When?

46:10.291 --> 46:11.490
Tonight

46:13.375 --> 46:14.574
I'm counting on you

46:16.458 --> 46:20.499
This is who I was telling you about -
General Hojo

46:20.500 --> 46:23.540
This is Eunuch Wei. In the Ming court,

46:23.541 --> 46:26.282
all are below him, except for one

46:27.208 --> 46:29.749
Having access to the great general's forces

46:29.750 --> 46:32.365
is a great honor for this humble servant

46:42.083 --> 46:47.865
"So many stars, are thoughts
that stir my sleep"

46:48.666 --> 46:52.907
"Like the moon, shining into night"

46:54.375 --> 47:00.282
"The past drifts away,
yet returns, so vague"

47:00.500 --> 47:05.615
"Like my visions of you"

47:06.541 --> 47:12.574
"Just a goodbye, yet so hard to say"

47:13.125 --> 47:17.532
"My heart left stranded"

47:18.791 --> 47:24.699
"A forever farewell, adistance so vast"

47:25.500 --> 47:30.615
"Just one, last look at you"

47:30.916 --> 47:36.540
"If time could slow down,"

47:36.541 --> 47:42.074
"Then I could think of you again."

47:42.250 --> 47:45.249
"Before that last day arrives,"

47:45.250 --> 47:49.082
"Let me rewrite its end."

47:49.083 --> 47:52.199
"Just one more moment,"

47:52.208 --> 47:57.157
"And we can have forever."

48:31.000 --> 48:33.240
It is an honor, Excellency

48:33.500 --> 48:36.407
General He, forgive my
not coming to meet you

48:36.833 --> 48:38.032
Please

48:46.916 --> 48:50.782
Our plan of grand conquest begins tonight!

48:51.791 --> 48:55.782
Luckily! Catch 2 for dinner

48:57.791 --> 49:01.074
You are on a mission for the Hojo clan

49:01.166 --> 49:03.574
Will you give it all you've got?

49:03.666 --> 49:04.865
Fear not, General!

49:07.291 --> 49:09.999
Thanks to the Emperor's good graces,

49:10.000 --> 49:11.740
I am home to see family

49:12.291 --> 49:15.832
Your sworn brother Yuanlong and
my daughter have come, too

49:15.833 --> 49:17.490
Professionally and personally,

49:17.833 --> 49:21.249
inviting master He Ying to attend is a must

49:21.250 --> 49:22.699
Brother He Ying!

49:30.375 --> 49:33.199
Little brother. Long time no see

49:33.208 --> 49:36.240
Indeed. I have yet to
wish the newlyweds well

49:36.916 --> 49:38.115
Congratulations, madame

49:38.458 --> 49:39.657
Most gracious, General He

49:39.958 --> 49:41.824
The new song you just learned -

49:41.833 --> 49:44.749
could you play it for my little brother

49:44.750 --> 49:46.415
to liven up tonight's celebration?

49:46.416 --> 49:48.157
I will do my best

49:57.375 --> 49:59.157
What,

49:59.500 --> 50:01.199
don't you like my hairstyle?

50:01.500 --> 50:03.532
I'm the one who gave it to you

50:06.458 --> 50:08.957
When you reach Tao Yuan village,

50:08.958 --> 50:12.324
kill everything and spare nothing!

50:13.666 --> 50:14.865
Kill!

50:14.958 --> 50:17.115
Kill! Kill!

50:17.125 --> 50:18.699
Move out!

50:23.875 --> 50:25.407
Niehu?

50:26.125 --> 50:28.449
Together with the Jap raiders?

50:35.250 --> 50:36.124
Minister...

50:36.125 --> 50:39.082
General He, Eunuch Wei has ordered

50:39.083 --> 50:42.290
that you hand the key activating the orb

50:42.291 --> 50:43.749
over to General Yuanlong
to take to the capitol

50:43.750 --> 50:46.749
for presentation to the Emperor

50:46.750 --> 50:48.157
I can't

50:48.166 --> 50:49.624
I cannot give it to him

50:49.625 --> 50:50.790
Minister

50:50.791 --> 50:51.957
should it be wrongly used,

50:51.958 --> 50:53.457
it would cause total

50:53.458 --> 50:55.115
chaos and harm everyone

50:55.416 --> 50:57.532
What's more, the Emperor is young

50:57.708 --> 51:00.490
Please think this matter over

51:02.083 --> 51:04.657
Minister Du, did you know

51:04.708 --> 51:06.199
This son-in-law of yours,

51:06.375 --> 51:08.457
has long known this secret

51:08.458 --> 51:11.157
He Ying, disobeying imperial edicts

51:11.375 --> 51:13.749
is a crime punishable by clan execution

51:13.750 --> 51:14.540
You shut up

51:14.541 --> 51:15.499
Minister

51:15.500 --> 51:16.949
I came tonight hoping that

51:16.958 --> 51:19.165
we might go to the palace

51:19.166 --> 51:20.374
and see the Emperor

51:20.375 --> 51:22.282
Do you realize that the Ming dynasty

51:22.541 --> 51:24.824
will be destroyed in ten years?

51:25.458 --> 51:27.240
If the Emperor stays in the dark,

51:27.250 --> 51:29.324
he will die of illness in two more years!

51:29.958 --> 51:31.449
Insolence!

51:31.625 --> 51:33.749
More ridiculous with every word!

51:33.750 --> 51:37.582
Since when do you decide
when the Ming will perish!

51:37.583 --> 51:40.324
And you dare curse the Emperor's life!

51:40.333 --> 51:41.249
Soldiers!

51:41.250 --> 51:42.574
Sir!

52:11.750 --> 52:14.490
Niehu! You'd dare collude
with the Japanese!

52:20.125 --> 52:22.915
Don't be so hasty, Sao. Let me explain

52:22.916 --> 52:25.824
You know I hate Jap raiders
more than anything!

52:25.833 --> 52:28.957
You could befriend the enemy

52:28.958 --> 52:30.907
and take them as your own?

52:31.666 --> 52:35.240
Your brothers are already allied with me

52:35.458 --> 52:37.699
Kill him, Niehu

52:39.458 --> 52:41.782
I know you're up to no good!

52:41.833 --> 52:43.990
Where did that group of raiders go?

52:44.541 --> 52:48.074
They went to level Tao Yuan village

52:48.791 --> 52:50.240
Jap bastard...

52:50.250 --> 52:52.032
I'm going to kill you!

54:33.708 --> 54:36.207
a beautiful life, wealth and rank,

54:36.208 --> 54:37.949
it's all bullshit!

54:37.958 --> 54:40.040
For me

54:40.041 --> 54:41.415
these two were nothing but an interlude

54:41.416 --> 54:42.707
They had to die.

54:42.708 --> 54:44.040
You have two choices

54:44.041 --> 54:46.032
One, your clan dies

54:46.083 --> 54:48.499
Two, give me the Linga

54:48.500 --> 54:50.115
and we work together

54:50.625 --> 54:52.540
And I say, I choose option three -

54:52.541 --> 54:53.582
me walking out

54:53.583 --> 54:55.449
and definitely not giving you the Linga!

54:57.083 --> 54:58.332
He Ying!

54:58.333 --> 55:01.540
Cooperating with me is your best choice!

55:01.541 --> 55:03.490
There is no better way!

55:08.333 --> 55:09.457
Stop!

55:09.458 --> 55:10.540
We grew up together!

55:10.541 --> 55:12.949
When I make it big, so will you!

55:16.583 --> 55:17.907
Bring it on!

55:19.125 --> 55:20.124
Stop it!

55:20.125 --> 55:22.032
I'm going to kill you tonight!

55:22.208 --> 55:24.032
I'm not going to hold back!

55:34.625 --> 55:37.365
So you come back from the future
and learned nothing?

55:40.875 --> 55:43.324
I learned only one thing from the future

55:44.791 --> 55:46.699
And that's...

55:52.583 --> 55:54.157
He Ying

55:54.416 --> 55:56.074
if you don't work with me,

55:56.375 --> 55:58.449
you won't be able to change history

57:07.791 --> 57:10.407
I found the Linga

57:31.000 --> 57:32.707
The big things we're working on

57:32.708 --> 57:33.790
why won't you help me?

57:33.791 --> 57:35.157
Why!

57:36.291 --> 57:38.074
Instead, you push me?

57:39.708 --> 57:41.449
Why must you push me!

57:42.041 --> 57:45.990
You push and push!

57:52.791 --> 57:54.240
Niehu

57:54.416 --> 57:55.949
settle this

58:01.208 --> 58:03.532
Did you guys have fun today?

58:03.750 --> 58:06.615
Yeah, but I'm a little tired

58:09.083 --> 58:11.874
You think the drill instructor will be mad

58:11.875 --> 58:13.874
because we slipped out?

58:13.875 --> 58:15.990
Who cares about him

58:16.041 --> 58:17.415
I'm hungry

58:17.416 --> 58:20.365
Why don't we catch a rabbit later?

58:20.625 --> 58:22.865
Yeah, good idea

58:23.375 --> 58:24.990
Niehu

58:25.791 --> 58:27.532
in the next life,

58:27.916 --> 58:30.532
I'm not going to catch rabbits with you

58:42.541 --> 58:46.699
Ever thought you might
sit up there one day?

59:02.208 --> 59:05.540
I never thought that
when Chinese kill each other,

59:05.541 --> 59:08.365
they'd more ruthless than us Japanese

59:52.375 --> 59:53.907
Ma!

59:55.208 --> 59:56.532
Jade!

59:56.916 --> 59:59.699
Ma!

01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:53.157
He Ying

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:55.157
you're back

01:00:58.708 --> 01:01:01.615
As long as you're back safe

01:01:13.583 --> 01:01:15.949
He Ying...

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:24.199
A man of character must do four things

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:27.365
Only then can my conscience be clear

01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:32.449
We must first protect our land,

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:35.365
our households,

01:01:36.708 --> 01:01:39.582
our brothers,

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:41.324
and our women and children

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:50.615
May!

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.824
May, I'm back!

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:07.541
May!

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.624
Boss

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:38.782
You're back

01:02:38.916 --> 01:02:42.290
Hojo's men wiped out the village

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.865
The Linga you wanted... we found it

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:51.699
He Ying

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.865
you didn't think I'd do it?

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.574
What?

01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:02.782
I killed Sao

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.740
He saw me with Hojo

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:07.615
I had to kill him

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:10.657
Good

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:13.407
You're in the big leagues now

01:03:22.875 --> 01:03:24.907
I'll get back the Linga,

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:27.324
then return and save you again

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:38.490
May

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.740
if the orb was right before us,

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:45.157
and could take us take us
once more to the future,

01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:47.365
Where would you most want to go?

01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:49.490
I don't know

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.657
You?

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:56.699
What I most want to know is -

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.615
where I came from...

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:03.490
and where I must go

01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:06.157

You're worthy of your title, General He

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.157

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.282
how could I have entered so easily?

and lived in peace!

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:54.290
Why did you kill them all?

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:55.865
Why?

01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:57.790
You deceived the Emperor

01:04:57.791 --> 01:04:58.832
You deserved extermination!

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:01.699

And your brother, Sao -

01:05:07.958 --> 01:05:11.282
also died by my sword

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:18.324

I delivered

I won't let your plan succeed!

01:07:39.208 --> 01:07:40.457
Fine, Yuanlong

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:42.240
I promise to start the orb!

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:43.290
But on one condition

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:44.832

01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:51.157

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:50.740
You've returned once more, General He

01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:53.915
Life becomes Death

01:19:53.916 --> 01:19:55.865
Death becomes Life

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:58.699
In three cycles

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:01.990
This is your last chance

01:20:03.208 --> 01:20:05.949
I'd already mastered the orb's secret

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:09.782
Why then can't I change history...
change fate?

01:20:10.666 --> 01:20:13.032
Such is life

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:17.032
When you chose to go right,

01:20:18.083 --> 01:20:20.407
what awaited you at the end

01:20:21.791 --> 01:20:26.115
was naturally a predetermined conclusion

01:20:29.666 --> 01:20:31.824
And should I choose to go left?

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:35.449
Would the outcome be different?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.124
I cannot answer you

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.157
as the choice is yours to make

01:20:41.583 --> 01:20:46.740
You can only find out by
walking the paths yourself

01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:49.990
If life's outcomes could be foreseen,

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:53.324
then what is the joy in life?

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:10.624
Perhaps...

01:21:10.625 --> 01:21:13.907
activating the orb was a mistake

01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:17.532
Possessing the ability
to travel through time

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:21.490
may not bring the happiness and
results one wants, after all

01:21:25.333 --> 01:21:27.615
Much less could it bring peace

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.949
Power corrupts

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:38.990
It stokes greed and ambition

01:21:39.416 --> 01:21:41.449
Its consequences can't be controlled

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.782
Man cannot even control his own fate

01:21:58.791 --> 01:22:01.074
How can he alter history?

01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:09.907
And so the space-time orb must be destroyed

01:22:13.791 --> 01:22:15.624
Traveling between past and future

01:22:15.625 --> 01:22:16.707
is a dream that

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:18.407
should not be realized

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.574
Yet I

01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:26.699
have become the universe's
sole time traveler
