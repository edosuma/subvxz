Previously on Medium:

00:01.450 --> 00:02.460
Sorry to interrupt.

00:02.480 --> 00:03.510
Alison Dubois, this is Special...

00:03.520 --> 00:05.980
Edward Cooper, of the FBI.

00:05.990 --> 00:07.939
I'm very familiar with your work,sir.

00:07.950 --> 00:09.720
I had a dream about this guy last night.

00:09.730 --> 00:11.350
What's he got that I don't?

00:11.370 --> 00:15.530
An amazing reputation as a
criminal profiler, for one thing.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.530
You see things,don't you?

00:17.550 --> 00:21.380
I dedicated myself to getting
inside the minds of killers.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.000
It wasn't my choice.

00:23.010 --> 00:27.190
You go into the heads of murderers
whether you want to or not.

00:28.510 --> 00:29.690
I know what you did.

00:29.710 --> 00:31.890
I know you put two
bullets into Richard Gomez,

00:31.900 --> 00:35.160
and I will find a way to expose you.

02:35.830 --> 02:40.270
as of now,my combi. the combination of my amplification
mirror optics and unique software logarithms

02:40.280 --> 02:44.510
make a consumer-grade solar
cell 10% more efficient.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.250
At least 10% more efficient.

02:47.260 --> 02:52.930
With additional funding, I think I can get
that number closer to 15,maybe even 20%.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.600
Very impressive.

02:54.610 --> 02:55.940
I'd fund your project.

02:55.950 --> 02:57.120
Really?

02:57.150 --> 02:59.310
And how much money do you have?

02:59.320 --> 03:04.040
Including the redeemable bottles I'm
bringing back to the market, about $17.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.750
You know what? I'm gonna
stick with Buchanon-Lockhart.

03:07.430 --> 03:09.680
I think they're gonna
want to fund you,too.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.360
Oh,they'd better.

03:11.380 --> 03:14.480
They're the only venture capital
firm I could get a meeting with.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.610
If this presentation doesn't go well,

03:18.640 --> 03:23.350
I'm pretty much gonna have to hold
a bake sale to raise the capital.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.420
You reading Cooper's book again?

03:27.430 --> 03:30.150
I was just thumbing through
it when you were in the shower.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.960
I just can't get that
dream out of my head.

03:32.970 --> 03:35.010
I tried calling the FBI this morning.

03:35.020 --> 03:37.420
They wouldn't tell me where he
was or what he was working on.

03:37.430 --> 03:40.360
Well,I guess they're not in the habit of

03:40.370 --> 03:43.550
supplying the whereabouts of
their agents to anyone who asks.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.270
Guess not.

03:46.130 --> 03:48.300
Well,even if you could
find him,what would you do?

03:48.310 --> 03:49.450
What would you say to him?

03:49.460 --> 03:52.840
How are you gonna stop whatever
it is you saw from happening?

03:52.850 --> 03:55.930
You know the drill. This
guy-- he kills killers.

03:55.940 --> 03:58.190
It's still killing.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.710
No,I know. I just... I-I...
You know,you're right.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.710
And you did let him
get away with it once.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.920
Yeah. Don't think that
hasn't kept me up nights.

04:05.930 --> 04:07.810
Mom!

04:08.140 --> 04:11.080
Mom,I need you!

04:12.130 --> 04:14.210
Bridgette's wiggling her
teeth while I'm trying to eat.

04:14.230 --> 04:17.670
So what? Do you have a problem with
a kid trying to make some extra money?

04:17.680 --> 04:19.430
Okay. What is the matter?

04:19.440 --> 04:21.079
What is the commotion all about?

04:21.089 --> 04:23.930
Bridgette's teeth are loose and she's wiggling them
with her fingers trying to get them to come out.

04:23.940 --> 04:25.090
It's disgusting.

04:25.100 --> 04:30.250
It is not disgusting if each of these
teeth is worth a dollar under my pillow.

04:30.260 --> 04:33.530
Bridgette,honey, you're supposed to just
wait for your teeth to fall out on their own.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.750
You're not supposed to use
your fingers to loosen them.

04:35.770 --> 04:36.990
I don't know,Mom.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.940
I've been hearing about how
bad the economy is and...

04:39.950 --> 04:43.960
hereI am,sitting on 26 bucks.
I can make a difference.

04:43.970 --> 04:46.180
That's the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.580
All right,stop it.
Stop it,stop it. Listen.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.070
Daddy has a really big day.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.500
I want no more commotion.
I want no tugging.

04:55.510 --> 04:58.010
I want no nuh-uh'ing. I want silence.

04:58.020 --> 05:01.320
I'm here because the District Attorney
has asked me to bring my expertise to bear

05:01.330 --> 05:04.500
on a potentially very difficult case.

05:04.510 --> 05:08.030
I arrived in Phoenix
yesterday, but I've already...

05:08.040 --> 05:11.550
concluded my preliminary
analysis of the police files.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.420
Oh,my God.

05:22.970 --> 05:25.170
Oh,well,this must be important.

05:25.180 --> 05:29.230
I don't know if you've heard, but we've
got a serial killer here in Phoenix.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.850
I may have heard a little
something about that.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.120
What's on your mind,Allison?

05:32.140 --> 05:33.150
Agent Edward Cooper.

05:33.170 --> 05:34.670
I know he's in town working on the case.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.240
I need to know what he's up to.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.830
That's Gretchen Ballard.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.710
She was a hooker,worked
the area around Shadyside.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.320
Seven months ago a garbageman
found her body in an alley.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.040
Somebody'd stabbed her 26 times.

05:46.060 --> 05:46.790
Oh,God.

05:46.810 --> 05:47.820
A buddy of mine caught the case.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.170
He never solved it, but he always
remembered one little detail.

05:51.180 --> 05:55.640
When they found Gretchen Ballard's body,
she was wearing a silver wedding band.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.580
Really? A prostitute
with a wedding band?

05:57.590 --> 05:59.710
That's weird,right?

05:59.720 --> 06:03.380
Well,two days ago, some kids found
the body of another prostitute.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.080
Amanda Boone.

06:05.090 --> 06:08.330
Also stabbed more than
20 times. Also wearing...

06:08.340 --> 06:10.490
a silver wedding band?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.330
Okay,that's weird.

06:12.340 --> 06:16.910
Cooper's in town to help us determine
if the two cases are connected.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.510
He went through all the old
case files, and he found a third,

06:20.520 --> 06:23.640
unsolved murder that's
a potential match.

06:23.650 --> 06:28.660
A little over a year ago, a pro named Nina
Jarvis was stabbed to death in Glendale.

06:28.670 --> 06:31.400
The ME's report said she was
wearing a silver wedding band.

06:31.420 --> 06:34.480
Nobody thought much of it at the time,
but now Cooper wants to take a look.

06:34.490 --> 06:36.000
So where's Cooper now?

06:36.010 --> 06:38.030
Why does that matter so much to you?

06:38.050 --> 06:40.530
If you've seen something that ties to
this case, why don't you just tell me?

06:40.550 --> 06:42.250
I'll make sure word gets to Cooper.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.590
Because I can't.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.590
Cooper's the only person
I can talk to about this.

06:46.610 --> 06:48.770
Now,where is he? Please.

06:48.780 --> 06:51.720
Right about now, Cooper's getting
a little face time with Nina Jarvis,

06:51.730 --> 06:53.290
our potential third victim.

06:53.310 --> 06:56.740
They're exhuming her body to see
if her ring matches the other two.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.520
Now,you didn't hear it from me, but
she's buried at Sycamore Hill Cemetery.

07:00.550 --> 07:04.200
If you drive over there now, I'm sure
you'll find what you're looking for.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.950
Mr. Dubois?

07:13.960 --> 07:15.490
Can I get you anything to drink?

07:15.510 --> 07:17.870
Oh,no,thank you. I'm fine.

07:20.670 --> 07:23.210
It's a good sign, you know.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.790
The fact that they're still talking.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.290
It means your presentation went well.

07:39.770 --> 07:40.920
Miss Doyle.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.210
I'm sorry,Mr. Dubois.

07:42.220 --> 07:46.810
As we mentioned in the meeting, we've already got
a couple of competitive projects in the pipeline.

07:46.820 --> 07:48.390
We're worried about overlap.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.110
It's okay. Really.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.840
Uh,just grateful you were
willing to hear me out.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.620
For what it's worth...

07:54.630 --> 07:56.390
I fought for you.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.000
I happen to think your idea's a lot
smarter than the ones we're backing.

08:00.010 --> 08:02.950
Well,for what it's
worth, I appreciate that.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.460
I just want to reiterate what an honor it
is to be working with you, Agent Cooper.

08:11.470 --> 08:15.470
I've followed your career for many years,
even had the pleasure of reading your books.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.420
I want to assure you that if we do
learn that these murders are connected,

08:19.430 --> 08:24.060
my office is prepared to offer you whatever
resources you may need to catch the perpetrator.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.330
And if it would be at all helpful,

08:26.350 --> 08:31.370
I'm happy to liaise with the mayor's office
on your behalf, perhaps even the media.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.539
That's quite a selfless
gesture,Mr. Van Dyke,

08:35.549 --> 08:38.880
offering to stand in front
of all those cameras for me.

08:57.220 --> 09:00.220
It's a match to the other rings.

09:01.090 --> 09:04.380
Looks like you're going to end
up in front of a camera after all.

09:04.390 --> 09:07.110
I'll inform the mayor.

09:15.270 --> 09:17.460
Mrs. Dubois, what a pleasant surprise.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.630
Welcome back to Phoenix, Agent Cooper.

09:19.650 --> 09:21.740
I wish I could say I was
glad to be back in town,

09:21.750 --> 09:26.410
but,unfortunately,you can
see that I'm here on business.

09:26.420 --> 09:29.020
Speaking of which, I can't tell
you how disappointed I was to hear

09:29.040 --> 09:32.100
that you're no longer consulting
for the District Attorney's office.

09:32.110 --> 09:33.790
I'm sure you are.

09:33.810 --> 09:35.060
I mean it.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.890
I know how very good
you are at what you do.

09:38.900 --> 09:42.700
I suspect I know it better than most.

09:42.710 --> 09:45.210
I don't have much time, Agent
Cooper, so if you'll forgive me,

09:45.230 --> 09:46.910
I'll just cut right to the chase.

09:46.930 --> 09:51.050
I know what you're doing here in
Phoenix and I'm here to tell you

09:51.070 --> 09:53.810
I'm not going to let
you get away with it.

09:53.820 --> 09:57.090
You're not going to let me get
away with catching a serial killer?

09:57.110 --> 09:58.890
I'm not going to let you kill him.

09:58.910 --> 10:01.900
I had a dream and I
saw you murder a man.

10:01.910 --> 10:04.990
I'm not sure what you think you saw,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.260
but the fact of the matter is
I'm not like the men that I hunt.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.240
I don't do what I do out of compulsion.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.220
I do it out of necessity.

10:13.240 --> 10:17.510
I only take action
when the system fails.

10:17.520 --> 10:23.250
But I assure you my intention
is to bring this man to justice,

10:23.260 --> 10:25.210
not deliver my own brand of it.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.740
I know what I saw.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.170
I saw you sneaking
into a man's hotel room.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.410
You had your gun out.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.960
I saw the look on his face
when you were closing in on him.

10:33.970 --> 10:35.740
I'm sorry.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.570
Did you just say that
you saw this man's face?

10:42.880 --> 10:46.150
Can you describe him to me?

10:48.040 --> 10:50.050
I know what you're thinking.

10:50.060 --> 10:55.640
You don't want to give me a description
of a man you think I'm going to murder.

10:58.180 --> 11:02.050
Prioritize,Mrs. Dubois.

11:02.060 --> 11:07.510
Help me protect the citizens
of Phoenix from a serial killer.

11:07.520 --> 11:12.130
Then you can worry about protecting
the serial killer from me.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.760
Agent Cooper?

11:14.770 --> 11:16.950
Is this woman bothering you?

11:16.960 --> 11:19.120
Quite the contrary, Mr. Van Dyke.

11:19.130 --> 11:22.840
Mrs. Dubois and I are just
working out the terms of a deal.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.140
I'm sorry. I don't
understand. What kind of deal?

11:26.400 --> 11:31.490
I'm assuming that your offer to provide me with
whatever resource I might need still stands.

11:31.510 --> 11:32.080
Of course it does.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.980
Good. Because I need her.

11:35.590 --> 11:38.120
I need Allison Dubois.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.130
Boy,have I not missed seeing that
sort of stuff around the house.

11:44.610 --> 11:46.050
Sorry. They're Agent Cooper's.

11:46.060 --> 11:50.540
He wanted me to look over everything he
had, make sure I was ready for tomorrow.

11:51.490 --> 11:53.150
Gotta hand it to that guy.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.450
He must be one hell of a salesman.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.250
Salesman?

11:57.260 --> 12:00.350
I'm just saying that this morning
you couldn't live with the possibility

12:00.360 --> 12:01.910
that he might take another life.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.790
And,tonight,he's your new partner.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.840
He swore to me that he wouldn't
harm the man who killed these women.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.720
You at least got a pinky-swear
to that effect,right?

12:11.730 --> 12:16.130
'Cause,without one, he's really under
no legal obligation to stop killing.

12:19.980 --> 12:22.410
I'm sorry. I shouldn't tease.

12:22.420 --> 12:27.150
Frankly,I'm just glad that someone in
this house is bringing home a paycheck.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.260
Honey,I'm sorry it didn't work
out with those venture capitalists.

12:30.270 --> 12:35.400
I guess I could learn a thing or two
about salesmanship from Agent Cooper,huh?

12:35.410 --> 12:37.780
Oh,come on. You know you
gave a good presentation.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.700
They told you it was a good idea.

12:39.710 --> 12:42.780
Yeah? Well,that and a quarter...

12:44.390 --> 12:49.470
You know,if you're looking for investors,
maybe you might want to try Bridgette.

12:51.470 --> 12:55.230
Well,she's having quite a
run with the tooth fairy.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.250
A dollar a tooth.

12:56.260 --> 12:59.680
You know,maybe if we feed
her nothing but taffy...

13:00.230 --> 13:02.730
That's not funny.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.970
I'm sorry.

13:14.230 --> 13:19.790
Having had some time to familiarize myself with the
forensic evidence gathered from the three victims,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.870
as well as the manner in
which they were killed,

13:22.890 --> 13:29.130
I've prepared a very preliminary psychological
profile of the man we're looking for.

13:29.440 --> 13:34.410
His methodology indicates he has
deep-seated issues with women.

13:34.420 --> 13:38.450
He probably compensates for his
inability to deal with the opposite sex

13:38.470 --> 13:43.120
by concentrating excessively
on his own appearance.

13:43.130 --> 13:48.150
He's not an attractive
man, but he's a vain one.

13:48.160 --> 13:53.640
I wouldn't be surprised if he adheres
to a rigorous exercise regimen.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.490
Very impressive, Agent Cooper.

13:59.510 --> 14:00.990
I'll give you that.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.300
Hair color,eye color, approximate
age,height, and weight.

14:05.870 --> 14:10.780
Given this level of detail, I take it we
now have a witness to one of the murders?

14:10.790 --> 14:15.050
Let's just say that Mrs.
Dubois' consulting services

14:15.060 --> 14:17.490
have already proven quite valuable,

14:17.500 --> 14:18.990
and leave it at that.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.950
You stand behind this composite then?

14:21.980 --> 14:25.410
You're willing to stake
your reputation on it?

14:25.790 --> 14:29.950
Why,Mr. District Attorney, I
thought we were in this together.

14:30.490 --> 14:35.000
I'll make sure it's distributed then.

14:35.010 --> 14:37.730
I've asked Mrs. Dubois
to work from here today.

14:37.740 --> 14:40.940
Go through your mug books, see
if any faces jump out at her.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.260
She's welcome to any
vacant desk in the bullpen.

14:43.270 --> 14:46.360
- That'll be fine.
- I'm afraid that's not quite good enough.

14:46.370 --> 14:51.640
Mrs. Dubois requires a certain
amount of quiet to do her job.

14:51.650 --> 14:54.480
A certain amount of solitude.

14:54.900 --> 14:58.760
I thought maybe you could put her
up in one of your private offices.

15:00.670 --> 15:01.780
Agent Cooper...

15:01.790 --> 15:04.430
Mr. Van Dyke.

15:05.470 --> 15:09.640
I realize that you and
Mrs. Dubois have a history,

15:09.890 --> 15:14.200
but surely you're willing to put that aside
in the interest of catching this killer.

15:14.670 --> 15:16.560
After all...

15:16.570 --> 15:18.450
I'd hate to have the
press get wind of the fact

15:18.460 --> 15:24.010
that I was getting anything less
than your complete cooperation.

15:28.150 --> 15:32.160
I believe we have an office
available on the second floor.

15:32.170 --> 15:34.310
You're welcome to it.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.060
That wasn't really necessary.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.070
What wasn't?

15:37.080 --> 15:40.400
That. Much as I love
watching that weasel squirm,

15:40.410 --> 15:43.400
I didn't even have my own office
when Devalos was in charge.

15:43.410 --> 15:48.000
Well,maybe he didn't value
your services as much as I do.

15:48.010 --> 15:50.000
Well,while we're on the
subject of my services,

15:50.010 --> 15:52.670
I had another dream about
our killer last night,

15:52.680 --> 15:55.360
and you should know that your
profile was right on the money.

15:55.390 --> 15:57.030
He was watching your press conference

15:57.040 --> 16:00.110
while he adhered to his
"rigorous exercise regimen."

16:00.120 --> 16:02.510
Did you see anything that
might help us locate him?

16:02.520 --> 16:06.280
No,but he didn't look too happy
about having the darkest corners

16:06.290 --> 16:09.150
of his psyche aired on television.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.790
"Unhappy" is good, Mrs. Dubois.

16:12.130 --> 16:16.500
If he's unhappy, he's that
much closer to making a mistake.

16:16.510 --> 16:18.670
Mr. Dubois?

16:21.260 --> 16:22.460
Hello.

16:22.470 --> 16:23.410
I'm glad you found me.

16:23.420 --> 16:26.480
My assistant's not always the
best when it comes to directions.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.050
Please.

16:31.210 --> 16:35.940
Well,I'm due back at the office, so
I'm going to get right to the point.

16:36.410 --> 16:41.100
I'm here because I want to help you develop
your solar cell amplification system.

16:41.110 --> 16:44.610
And I believe I have
the funding to do it.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.790
Ms. Doyle,Meghan...

16:50.800 --> 16:53.010
I don't know what to say. I
don't know how to thank you.

16:53.020 --> 16:55.080
I don't know what you said to your
colleagues to bring them around,but...

16:55.090 --> 16:56.670
Actually,I didn't say anything.

16:56.680 --> 17:01.550
I'm sure they're just as dead-set against going
into business with you today as they were yesterday.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.940
Then I'm afraid I'm a little confused.

17:04.950 --> 17:06.900
You just said that you had the funding.

17:06.910 --> 17:09.050
If the money's not coming from
Buchanon-Lockhart,then where...

17:09.060 --> 17:10.520
Me,Mr. Dubois.

17:10.540 --> 17:13.190
The money would be coming from me.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.690
Like I told you yesterday,
I believe in your idea.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.040
I think it's a money-maker.

17:18.050 --> 17:22.760
And the truth is, I've been looking for
an opportunity like this for a long time.

17:22.770 --> 17:26.470
I'm tired of making money
for Buchanon-Lockhart.

17:26.510 --> 17:28.310
I want to go into business for myself.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.730
I want to get my hands dirty.

17:30.740 --> 17:35.600
I've saved about $300,000 just
waiting to hear the right idea.

17:35.610 --> 17:38.130
And I think I've heard it.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.460
Agent Cooper?

17:48.380 --> 17:50.120
Agent Cooper,it's late.

17:50.130 --> 17:52.800
I was going to head home.

17:55.870 --> 17:58.190
Agent Cooper...

18:03.390 --> 18:06.590
I see you've found my
high-tech security system.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.930
I do it everywhere I go.

18:07.940 --> 18:10.000
It's just something I use to make sure

18:10.010 --> 18:12.950
that nobody's been in
my office while I'm gone.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.590
It's a bit paranoid, I know.

18:14.600 --> 18:18.170
But I'm afraid I just can't help myself.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.910
Well,I went through
these files twice,sir.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.700
Our killer's not in here.

18:32.450 --> 18:33.550
I'm sorry.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.900
Oh,no need for apologies.

18:35.910 --> 18:39.070
Well,I just wish we were further along.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.440
"Further along?"

18:41.940 --> 18:46.250
Mrs. Dubois, because of you,

18:46.280 --> 18:50.560
I have what could very well turn out to
be a physical description of the killer.

18:50.580 --> 18:55.290
You've also given me reason to believe
that my profile of the man is accurate.

18:55.610 --> 18:59.000
I think it's fair to say that because
of your involvement in this case,

18:59.020 --> 19:03.350
I'm potentially weeks ahead
of where I'd normally be.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.950
Well,thank you,sir.

19:06.240 --> 19:10.790
I have to say it's been a long time since
anyone's taken my dreams so seriously,

19:10.800 --> 19:14.320
especially here in the
District Attorney's office.

19:14.330 --> 19:18.100
Well, shame on them for
ignoring your talents.

19:18.110 --> 19:20.940
I would never be so obtuse.

19:20.950 --> 19:23.410
I know what I have in you.

19:23.750 --> 19:24.940
Good night,sir.

19:24.950 --> 19:26.730
Good night.

20:45.600 --> 20:49.620
Housekeeping. Do you
want turndown service?

21:01.930 --> 21:03.090
Hello.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.230
Allison,it's Lee Scanlon.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.600
I'm sorry to wake you, but I knew
you'd want to hear this right away.

21:07.610 --> 21:09.620
It's about Agent Cooper.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.470
He was shot. Twice.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.430
Oh,my God,no.

21:14.650 --> 21:18.260
*********

21:20.020 --> 21:22.870
Whoever killed Cooper didn't
leave much evidence behind.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.570
Swept his hotel for fingerprints--
anything that might have DNA on it.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.460
So far nothing.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.110
Service weapon's missing,too.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.860
We think the killer might have
taken it with him as a trophy.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.060
I had it all wrong.

21:34.070 --> 21:36.270
I thought I saw Cooper
hunting the killer.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.300
The killer was really hunting him.

21:42.640 --> 21:46.270
I hate to be the bearer of
even more bad news, but,uh...

21:46.280 --> 21:48.620
Van Dyke wants to see you in his office.

21:48.630 --> 21:51.840
Asked if you'd come
there as soon as you can.

22:28.530 --> 22:30.990
I'm so sorry.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.490
What did I tell you about apologies?

22:33.500 --> 22:35.220
They're not necessary.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.300
I wish I'd done more for you.

22:39.080 --> 22:43.670
Mrs. Dubois,I only have
so many pep talks in me.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.370
I've told you I'm happy with your work.

22:46.380 --> 22:49.290
Now if it's all right with you,
I'd like to get down to business.

22:49.310 --> 22:53.010
I'm going to be interviewing the
acquaintances of the most recent victim today,

22:53.030 --> 22:56.230
and I'd like you to come with me.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.210
Oh,sir...

22:59.090 --> 23:02.750
I'm not sure you understand
what happened to you last night.

23:02.760 --> 23:07.200
Well,actually,last night is a bit fuzzy.

23:07.210 --> 23:10.320
Do you remember going home?

23:10.330 --> 23:13.590
Going to your hotel room?

23:13.600 --> 23:16.700
That man that you were looking for...

23:16.710 --> 23:19.980
he was waiting there for you.

23:19.990 --> 23:23.240
And he shot you twice.

23:25.380 --> 23:31.080
And you... didn't survive.

23:41.240 --> 23:45.700
This... this just can't be.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.080
I don't know what you
think you're doing in here,

23:49.090 --> 23:53.330
but those files are
no longer your concern.

23:55.270 --> 23:58.620
And in light of Edward
Cooper's tragic death,

23:58.640 --> 24:02.320
the Phoenix District Attorney's office
no longer has any need for your...

24:02.340 --> 24:06.580
services. They're terminated,
effective immediately.

24:06.920 --> 24:10.070
I need you out of the
building, Mrs. Dubois.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.820
It's 11:00. What do you say?

24:19.830 --> 24:22.410
I'm not ready yet.

24:22.730 --> 24:25.030
The guy was a killer,Allison.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.630
You couldn't tell me enough.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.830
The guy was a killer.

24:27.850 --> 24:31.320
That doesn't mean he
deserved what he got.

24:34.680 --> 24:38.050
I got those papers
from Meghan Doyle today.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.950
Turns out she has a rather flexible
definition of the word "partnership."

24:41.960 --> 24:43.910
What do you mean?

24:43.930 --> 24:48.320
On exchange for funding,
she wants 51% ownership.

24:48.340 --> 24:51.360
I'm told that's a
non-negotiable figure.

24:51.370 --> 24:54.210
I don't get it. That
only leaves you 49%.

24:54.220 --> 24:57.080
Exactly. Minority share.

24:57.090 --> 24:59.640
She's trying to buy
the right to be my boss.

24:59.670 --> 25:01.210
Tell her no.

25:01.220 --> 25:04.040
Yeah,it definitely crossed my mind.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.510
I was also thinking
maybe I'd tell her yes.

25:09.930 --> 25:11.930
I want to get on with it,honey.
I want to get on with my life.

25:11.940 --> 25:15.910
I want to earn a living. I
want to accomplish something.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.480
Do you want to give up
control of your idea?

25:18.500 --> 25:19.780
No,of course I don't.

25:19.790 --> 25:21.530
Then don't.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.350
If Meghan Doyle thinks your idea
is great, somebody else will,too.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.200
Somebody who's willing
to do it your way.

25:27.210 --> 25:28.700
Okay.

25:28.710 --> 25:31.270
Is that an official psychic prediction?

25:31.280 --> 25:35.860
That's an official wife who
believes in her husband prediction.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.800
What do you say?

25:40.810 --> 25:43.300
It's past 11:00.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.160
I'm just saying I thought the ending
was spectacularly stupid,that's all.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.820
Fine,you don't like
romantic comedies. I get it.

25:49.830 --> 25:51.420
I didn't say that.

25:51.430 --> 25:55.210
The next time we go to the movies,
we'll see something about zombies.

25:55.230 --> 25:56.750
Or ninjas.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.500
Or ninjas fighting zombies.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.430
You promise?

26:06.700 --> 26:08.950
What's going on? You okay?

26:08.960 --> 26:12.420
Yeah,I'm sorry. It was a bad dream.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.570
More serial killer stuff?

26:15.580 --> 26:19.170
No. It was a car accident.

26:19.180 --> 26:21.990
- You need to call someone?
- No.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.030
I don't know who they were.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.660
I don't know where they were.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.510
It's okay. Go back to sleep.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.230
I'm going to get a glass of water.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.650
COOPER: You have a
lovely home, Mrs. Dubois.

26:44.660 --> 26:47.030
It's very you.

26:50.420 --> 26:55.430
I wanted to apologize for
disappearing this morning.

26:56.530 --> 26:59.500
I didn't quite have a
handle on my situation yet.

26:59.510 --> 27:03.140
You know,if there's anything
you need me to do, maybe...

27:03.160 --> 27:05.700
give a message to your loved ones.

27:05.710 --> 27:08.120
Mrs. Dubois...

27:08.130 --> 27:12.430
Are you forgetting that we
still have a killer to catch?

27:13.140 --> 27:19.640
My own murder was unfortunate,yes, but it
hardly changes the nature of our collaboration.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.620
Are you saying you're
here because of the case?

27:22.630 --> 27:25.220
Why else would I be here?

27:25.230 --> 27:29.010
My last moments were
extremely unpleasant.

27:29.020 --> 27:32.330
Not because of the
considerable pain I was in,

27:32.340 --> 27:38.180
but because,as far as I knew, I
wasn't going to close this case.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.670
My killer reveled in that fact.

27:41.680 --> 27:46.520
He stood over me as I
lay dying, taunting me.

27:46.530 --> 27:52.020
He insisted that Gretchen Ballard and Amanda
Boone and Nina Jarvis were only the beginning;

27:52.500 --> 27:58.430
that with with me out of the picture, no
one could stop him from taking more lives.

27:59.860 --> 28:02.720
But with your help...

28:02.730 --> 28:06.370
I'd like to show him
just how wrong he was.

28:06.390 --> 28:08.700
Okay.

28:08.710 --> 28:11.500
What would you like me to do?

28:11.510 --> 28:13.300
To start with...

28:13.340 --> 28:16.730
first thing this morning I want
you to go back to the police

28:16.740 --> 28:19.260
and give them a description
of the man who killed me.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.950
Okay. But I already did that.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.050
You were there when we made the sketch.

28:24.060 --> 28:28.360
Yes,I know. You told him
that he was a compact man...

28:28.710 --> 28:31.970
long hair,hazel eyes, extremely fit.

28:31.990 --> 28:33.210
And he was.

28:33.230 --> 28:35.860
Well,no,actually,he wasn't.

28:35.870 --> 28:38.690
The man who killed me
was short,middle-aged,

28:38.700 --> 28:42.840
shaved head, bit on the pudgy side.

28:42.850 --> 28:45.210
Frankly,I'm...

28:45.620 --> 28:49.480
I'm a little embarrassed
that he got the drop on me.

28:49.860 --> 28:54.910
I don't know whose face you've been
seeing in your dreams,Mrs. Dubois,

28:54.930 --> 28:58.730
but he's not the killer
that we've been looking for.

29:05.550 --> 29:06.810
******

29:06.820 --> 29:07.590
I'm glad I caught you.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.930
I need to talk to you about Cooper.

29:09.940 --> 29:12.480
That's funny. I was just about to
call you about the very same subject.

29:12.490 --> 29:16.040
A valet at the hotel where Cooper was staying
just got a look of your sketch of the killer.

29:16.100 --> 29:20.000
He saw a guy who looked just like him peeling out of
the hotel parking lot the night Cooper was murdered.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.110
Valet remembers the make
and model of the car,

29:22.120 --> 29:24.820
and get this, he even got a
partial on the guy's license plate

29:24.830 --> 29:26.930
because he thought the guy
might have been driving drunk.

29:26.950 --> 29:28.190
Seems like a pretty good lead,right?

29:28.210 --> 29:29.610
I was just about to go run it down.

29:29.620 --> 29:32.060
Don't bother. The sketch is wrong.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.140
What are you talking about?
The sketch came from you.

29:34.150 --> 29:35.600
I don't know what to tell you.

29:35.610 --> 29:38.720
Apparently,I got the wrong face.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.630
Uh,and you know that because?

29:41.640 --> 29:44.420
I know that because Cooper
came to see me last night.

29:44.450 --> 29:48.020
And he saw the man who shot him and
it wasn't the person I described.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.800
Okay,what do you want from me then?

29:49.810 --> 29:52.250
A favor. I need to look
through the mug books again.

29:52.260 --> 29:54.980
Why? You just got done telling me
you didn't see the killer's face.

29:54.990 --> 29:58.890
Well,that's true I
didn't, but Cooper did.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.350
Lynn,hey.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.770
Sorry,it doesn't look like
lunch is in the cards today.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.620
What am I doing?

30:20.630 --> 30:24.690
You wouldn't believe it,
not in a million years.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.810
His name is Donald Kessler.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.650
Convicted of rape in '97.

30:35.660 --> 30:38.120
Served ten years and
got out last spring.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.930
Cooper's positive this is our guy?

30:39.940 --> 30:42.750
He said there's no doubt about it.

30:43.550 --> 30:48.340
Well,according to this, our friend Mr. Kessler
skipped out on his parole about six months ago.

30:48.350 --> 30:50.060
Present whereabouts unknown.

30:50.070 --> 30:52.880
It says here he's got
a sister in Glendale.

30:52.890 --> 30:56.280
Maybe you could go talk to her and
see if she's heard from him lately.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.140
Talk to people? Yeah,sure,I can do that.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.700
Ask some questions--
not a problem.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.700
Who knows,I might even
be able to find the guy.

31:01.730 --> 31:04.830
Just try to remember, it's going to
take a whole lot more than the word of

31:04.840 --> 31:09.300
a dead FBI guy for me
to actually arrest him.

31:15.030 --> 31:16.850
Hey,partner.

31:16.860 --> 31:19.480
Come on. Sit down. We have
some celebrating to do.

31:19.490 --> 31:20.800
No,Meghan, I don't want a drink.

31:22.070 --> 31:24.730
I'm not sure that I should even sit.

31:24.750 --> 31:28.500
I just,I figured you deserved
to hear this in person.

31:28.510 --> 31:30.370
Okay...

31:30.380 --> 31:34.740
You found someone else, another firm,
somebody you think is better connected.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.190
Willing to offer more capital?

31:36.200 --> 31:38.560
No,no,it's not that.

31:38.570 --> 31:40.410
For God's sake,sit down.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.100
People are looking.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.000
They think we're
lovers having a quarrel.

31:45.330 --> 31:47.420
I'm sorry.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.350
Meghan,uh...

31:51.390 --> 31:55.430
I'm extremely flattered by
your interest in my proposal.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.460
Um,I just... I didn't realize that you
were going to buy a controlling stake.

31:59.470 --> 32:02.930
That's just not something
that I'm willing to give up.

32:02.940 --> 32:04.160
I'm sorry.

32:04.170 --> 32:10.360
But unless you're willing to rethink the 51-49
split, I don't see how I can do this with you.

32:14.390 --> 32:17.630
Can I have a dirty martini?

32:17.640 --> 32:19.930
Joe?

32:21.650 --> 32:26.470
Gosh,you're going to turn me
downand make me drink alone?

32:26.480 --> 32:29.550
Okay,fine. I'll have what she's having.

32:34.060 --> 32:35.650
Someone win the lottery?

32:35.660 --> 32:37.120
Ah,not quite.

32:37.130 --> 32:41.970
One of Bridgette's teeth finally fell
out, so the Tooth Fairy owes her a dollar.

32:42.300 --> 32:45.660
And all I've got is a ten, a five and...

32:45.970 --> 32:48.170
89 cents.

32:48.180 --> 32:51.630
I got wrinkled and non-wrinkled.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.500
Martini,huh?

32:57.950 --> 33:01.060
So how'd it go? How'd she take it?

33:02.590 --> 33:05.760
Um,I signed the papers.

33:07.750 --> 33:08.990
You're upset.

33:09.010 --> 33:12.220
No,I'm not upset. I'm bewildered.

33:12.230 --> 33:14.190
You told me you were
gonna turn her down.

33:14.220 --> 33:18.040
I know,I know. And I,and I absolutely,
I should have talked to you first.

33:18.050 --> 33:22.290
I just... she really wants it.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.350
I don't know. When she started to tell
me about her plans for the business,

33:25.360 --> 33:27.930
what she thought the upside would
be in three years and five years,

33:27.940 --> 33:29.110
and I just can't explain it.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.590
I just started to get a
really good feeling about her.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.500
I guess you'd call it an intuition.

33:35.510 --> 33:39.920
I mean, if anybody can understand going
with their intuition, it's you,right?

33:40.330 --> 33:42.290
So what happened to "Let's be patient"?

33:42.300 --> 33:44.640
What happened to being your own boss?

33:44.650 --> 33:47.750
I don't know. Maybe I was
being a little naive about that.

33:47.760 --> 33:51.540
According to her, there's no way that I
have the leverage to get a majority share

33:51.550 --> 33:53.490
no matter who I sign with.

33:53.510 --> 33:57.580
Probably wouldn't even
get close to 49% either.

33:57.590 --> 34:02.300
Now,look,Al,I know this is out of
the blue, but tell me you're happy.

34:02.310 --> 34:05.910
This is gonna be so much
better if you're happy with it.

34:06.840 --> 34:11.110
I'm happy... as long as you are.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.320
I am.

34:13.330 --> 34:14.610
Well,then that's that.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.570
We are officially happy.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.880
Julia?

34:22.219 --> 34:25.100
Julia? Baby?

34:27.070 --> 34:29.150
You okay?

34:29.630 --> 34:31.260
What just happened?

34:31.270 --> 34:33.159
We were in a crash.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.889
Somebody just hit us.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.070
Stay here,okay?

34:39.080 --> 34:42.340
I'm gonna go check on the other driver.

35:00.790 --> 35:04.530
Hey,buddy? You okay?

35:04.540 --> 35:07.010
Mrs. Dubois?

35:07.020 --> 35:10.150
I found him, Mrs. Dubois.
I know where he is.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.350
Where who is?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.640
Donald Kessler, the man who murdered me.

35:13.650 --> 35:14.940
He's at a
bar downtown--

35:14.960 --> 35:17.430
the Old Stone Jug, 1818 Hamilton Street.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.930
If you and Detective Scanlon go down
there right now, you'll find him.

35:20.950 --> 35:24.300
You'll find evidence on him that
proves he murdered those women.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.760
Move,Mrs. Dubois! We
haven't a moment to spare!

35:28.660 --> 35:32.550
Wait a second. He said
it was the Old Stone Jug.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.580
You sure it was this Old Stone Jug?

35:34.590 --> 35:36.420
Well,1818 Hamilton Street.

35:36.430 --> 35:38.450
This is absolutely the place.

35:38.460 --> 35:41.090
Well,I don't know what
to tell you,Allison.

35:43.650 --> 35:46.150
According to this,the place
got condemned back in '05.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.090
No one's had a drink
here in a good long time.

35:48.100 --> 35:49.110
Well,he couldn't have been clearer.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.760
He said Donald Kessler
was here right now.

35:51.770 --> 35:54.020
Honestly,I'm a little confused myself.

35:54.030 --> 35:56.280
I know I never understood
exactly how your thing works,

35:56.290 --> 35:58.700
but you always made it
sound like after you die,

35:58.710 --> 36:01.620
you pretty much know everything
there is, was or ever will be.

36:01.630 --> 36:06.120
So tell me, how does a dead guy,
especially one as smart as Edward Cooper,

36:06.140 --> 36:09.040
make a mistake like this?

36:12.300 --> 36:15.410
Oh,boy,this doesn't look good.

36:17.420 --> 36:19.140
Wait. Pull over.

36:19.150 --> 36:20.620
It's being handled.

36:20.630 --> 36:23.850
I dreamt about this. Please pull over.

36:32.250 --> 36:35.230
You wait here. I'll go get the scoop.

37:05.660 --> 37:08.870
Looks a lot like the guy
in your sketch,doesn't he?

37:09.500 --> 37:12.320
This is him. This is the
man I saw kill Cooper.

37:12.330 --> 37:16.310
As much as I hate to disagree with
the ghost of a famous profiler,

37:16.320 --> 37:18.420
that is the man who
killed Edward Cooper.

37:18.430 --> 37:20.170
The name is Julian Pierce.

37:20.180 --> 37:24.950
First cops on the scene found a duffel bag
on the seat of his car that had a gun inside.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.060
They ran the serial numbers.

37:26.070 --> 37:28.960
Turns out it was a
government-issued firearm:

37:28.980 --> 37:30.970
Edward Cooper's
government-issued firearm.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.410
What about Donald Kessler?

37:32.430 --> 37:34.580
Donald Kessler didn't kill Cooper.

37:34.590 --> 37:37.850
He didn't kill those three
prostitutes either. Julian Pierce did.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.810
In addition to Cooper's gun,
they found a stash of photos.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.380
Polaroids of
the dead women--

37:43.390 --> 37:46.760
even a few close-ups of the wedding
bands he put on their fingers.

37:46.770 --> 37:51.820
I don't know why Cooper claimed that Donald
Kessler killed them, but he was wrong.

37:55.310 --> 37:59.600
Oh,no. No,he wasn't wrong.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.570
He was lying to us.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.420
He knew this was gonna happen.

38:04.430 --> 38:07.720
That's why he tried to throw
us off of Julian Pierce's scent.

38:07.750 --> 38:12.610
He knew if we arrested Pierce, before
tonight, he wouldn't have been in this car.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.590
He wouldn't have died in this accident.

38:14.610 --> 38:16.190
So you're saying this was a setup?

38:16.200 --> 38:20.140
That Cooper sent you on a wild goose chase
to guarantee that this guy died tonight?

38:20.150 --> 38:23.690
'Cause I have to tell you, Allison,
that sounds a lot like murder.

38:27.190 --> 38:29.530
Not to Cooper.

38:29.540 --> 38:34.330
To Edward Cooper, this was justice.

38:43.190 --> 38:46.280
You should know, Mrs. Dubois.

38:46.290 --> 38:51.340
The one thing I regret in
all this was lying to you.

38:51.350 --> 38:54.980
Well,I can see that.
Look,you're all torn up inside.

38:54.990 --> 38:59.060
I never intended for you to
come across that accident site.

38:59.070 --> 39:04.190
And I certainly didn't want the death of
Julian Pierce weighing on your conscience.

39:04.200 --> 39:10.980
I know how strongly you prefer working
within the confines of the justice system.

39:10.990 --> 39:15.770
For what it's worth, I wasn't lying when
you first came to me at the cemetery.

39:15.780 --> 39:20.910
I had absolutely no intention
of taking Julian Pierce's life.

39:20.920 --> 39:26.140
But as you well know,
circumstances changed.

39:26.150 --> 39:29.080
My death gave me a whole new...

39:29.110 --> 39:31.750
perspective on the man and his actions.

39:31.770 --> 39:32.800
New perspective.

39:32.830 --> 39:36.140
I think you're underestimating
how well I know you, Agent Cooper.

39:36.160 --> 39:39.980
This was revenge, pure and simple.

39:39.990 --> 39:45.280
I won't deny I took a certain amount
of pleasure in Mr. Pierce's death.

39:45.290 --> 39:51.400
But I assure you, what I did
tonight, I did for the greater good.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.830
Tell yourself whatever you want.

39:53.860 --> 39:55.510
I'm going to bed.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.090
Ellen Hartley.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.550
I beg your pardon?

39:59.560 --> 40:01.450
Ellen Hartley.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.590
She's a nurse at McCarren
State Penitentiary.

40:03.600 --> 40:09.180
It's where Mr. Pierce would have ended up
had you and Detective Scanlon arrested him.

40:09.190 --> 40:11.180
You'd like her,Mrs. Dubois.

40:11.190 --> 40:13.950
She's a mother of three just like you.

40:13.960 --> 40:17.080
In four years' time, Julian
Pierce was going to fake an illness

40:17.090 --> 40:20.700
so he could spend the night
in the prison infirmary.

40:20.710 --> 40:24.680
He was going to strangle Ellen Hartley.

40:24.900 --> 40:30.580
I suppose he wanted just one more notch
on his belt before they executed him.

40:30.590 --> 40:32.950
I don't believe you.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.420
You're lying to me again.

40:34.450 --> 40:36.450
It's all you've ever done.

40:36.460 --> 40:41.530
If there was some way I
could prove it to you,I would.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.280
But the fact of the matter
is you'll never know.

40:45.290 --> 40:47.130
You'll never be certain

40:47.140 --> 40:52.280
I did the right thing by facilitating
the death of Julian Pierce.

40:52.290 --> 40:53.930
But I am.

40:53.940 --> 40:57.080
I am absolutely positive

40:57.090 --> 41:01.490
the world is a much better
place without him in it.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.910
Why don't you just go away?

41:07.920 --> 41:10.710
I'm not ready to move on just yet.

41:10.720 --> 41:16.180
It occurs to me, Mrs. Dubois, that you
and I have a very unique opportunity.

41:16.190 --> 41:18.890
This doesn't have to be
our last collaboration.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.810
What are you talking about?

41:20.820 --> 41:23.430
I can see a lot of
things from this side,

41:23.440 --> 41:27.680
things I can't share
with anyone but you.

41:27.690 --> 41:31.380
If I were to catch on
to another Julian Pierce,

41:31.390 --> 41:36.120
you'd be in a unique position
to help me take care of it.

41:36.130 --> 41:38.570
You want me to help you end more lives?

41:38.580 --> 41:41.040
I want you to help me save lives:

41:41.050 --> 41:46.020
potential victims,good people
who don't deserve to die.

41:46.030 --> 41:48.070
It's so sad.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.160
I'm sure at some point
you were a good man.

41:50.190 --> 41:55.880
I don't know where you lost your way, but in
the end,you are no better than Julian Pierce.

41:56.490 --> 41:58.100
You're a killer.

41:58.110 --> 42:02.360
And before long, you're gonna wind
up in the same terrible place he is.

42:02.380 --> 42:05.360
I would never help you.
