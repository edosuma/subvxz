<i>looks like the hamburglar's</i>

<i> Well, you girls...</i>
<i>Look good.</i>

02:12.233 --> 02:16.869
<i> There was a slight pause</i>

[tires screech]

03:15.930 --> 03:25.070
Hello, hello, good morning.
Back again, girls.
Who are all of these other

03:25.072 --> 03:29.841
boys walking into the workroom?
I'm not feeling some of the
other queens.

03:29.843 --> 03:36.381
I don't like messy queens.
I don't like cheap queens.
And I don't like manly queens.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.785
So what do we think's gonna
happen today?
Guess there'll be a shemail

03:39.787 --> 03:43.088
and not the Gia kind.
Ooh.
[Laughter]

03:43.090 --> 03:52.130
[Woman screams]
You've got shemail.
Come on, scream.

03:52.132 --> 04:01.306
Racers...
Where are you?
I can't find you.

04:01.308 --> 04:11.083
Listen to me.
Stay away from the light.
Stay away from the light.

04:11.085 --> 04:16.021
Bitch, I said get the hell out
of my light.
[Laughter]

04:16.023 --> 04:22.594
[Huffs] That's better.
They're queer!
All: Ooh.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.365
What?
Hello, hello, hello.
[Cheers and applause]

04:26.367 --> 04:31.603
How is my blended drag family
getting along?
Sickening.

04:31.605 --> 04:38.443
Well, we'll see about that.
Now, I want you to pair up with
a queen that was not in your

04:38.445 --> 04:45.117
original group.
Now, for today's mini challenge,
each pair needs to combine

04:45.119 --> 04:52.557
bodies to create one
lip-syncing, bikini-wearing
bathing beauty, inspired by our

04:52.559 --> 05:00.866
friends at key west's five-star
island house resort.
Oh, scruff pit crew.

05:00.868 --> 05:07.072

Laganja Estranja.
Who's top, and who's bottom?

05:21.955 --> 05:25.223
Both: I'm the bottom.
What?
Oh, sorry.

05:25.225 --> 05:33.598
I'm the top.
[Laughs]
All right, assume the position.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.736
Oh, is this seat taken?
Hit it.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.174

[Laughs]
[Cheers and applause]

06:25.953 --> 06:32.424
Well, ladies, you all did
swimmingly, but the winners

<i> Oh, okay.</i>
<i>I've never heard of a delorean.</i>

<i> Well, not my father...</i>
<i>Because...</i>
<i>Because I don't have a father.</i>

09:48.055 --> 09:52.490
<i> I'm a little worried because</i>

<i>I'm excited because the original</i>

<i>is always better than</i>

10:26.860 --> 10:27.559
<i>the sequel.</i>

10:27.561 --> 10:28.560
<i> I was thinking Mrs. Hitchcock</i>

<i>It's a smaller role, and it's</i>

<i>just a head in a box, but I can</i>

<i>do something with it.</i>

<i>All right, so I think we're</i>

<i>Like, "shut up, girl.</i>
<i>It's just me."</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

<i> Oh, you want me to be black?</i>
<i> Well, I think it'd be</i>
<i>funnier.</i>

11:32.459 --> 11:35.060
<i> The black girl is playing</i>

11:35.062 --> 11:36.494

<i>When you're in that situation,</i>
<i>you can't rely on the other</i>

<i>You have to find it within</i>

<i> Next up, Gia Gunn.</i>
<i> I liked your performance.</i>
<i>I thought it was funny.</i>

<i>I thought you totally channeled</i>

<i> Well, it's funny, Gia,</i>

32:28.948 --> 32:33.250
<i>because on the set, you couldn't</i>
<i>remember a lot of the dialogue,</i>
<i>and it looked like you had</i>

<i>a technique.</i>
<i>But you and I both know that</i>

<i>the other roles?</i>
<i> Like this.</i>
<i>You have that, you have that,</i>

<i> So you might want to think</i>

<i>there is a game being played</i>
<i>here.</i>
<i> And of all the girls,</i>

33:05.184 --> 33:10.687
<i>you were the least prepared.</i>

<i>Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i> You delivered a very good</i>
<i>performance in the movie.</i>

33:36.915 --> 33:40.450
<i>You had just one of the best</i>
<i>screams.</i>
<i> Thank you, but I'm worried</i>

33:40.452 --> 33:43.587
<i>about you sitting so close to</i>
<i>Michelle's earring.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

33:43.589 --> 33:49.092
<i> [Buzzes]</i>
<i> Next up, Vivacious.</i>
<i> See, this type of look</i>

33:49.094 --> 33:53.630
<i>i don't hate because I grew up</i>
<i>with it, and so did Ru.</i>
<i> Sure.</i>

33:53.632 --> 33:56.833
<i> So I appreciate what it is</i>
<i>that you're doing.</i>
<i> Right.</i>

33:56.835 --> 34:01.405
<i> With that said, the acting,</i>
<i>because you were unsure of what</i>
<i>you were saying, you weren't</i>

34:01.407 --> 34:05.275
<i>able to kind of give it all you</i>
<i>got.</i>
<i> I feel like you're not really</i>

34:05.277 --> 34:10.480
<i>embracing fully.</i>
<i> And in my defense, I have no</i>
<i>theatrical background</i>

34:10.482 --> 34:13.817
<i>whatsoever.</i>
<i> Uh, look at yourself.</i>
<i>[British accent] what you do for</i>

34:13.819 --> 34:18.188
<i>a living is theater.</i>
<i> Are you holding your</i>
<i>headpiece back so that you can</i>

34:18.190 --> 34:20.490
<i>hear?</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> I thought you were doing that</i>

34:20.492 --> 34:23.193
<i>Mariah Carey thing, you know,</i>
<i>where she holds her ear like</i>
<i>that.</i>

34:23.195 --> 34:27.197
<i>[Sings]</i>
<i> No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i> All right, ladies, while you</i>

34:27.199 --> 34:32.803
<i>unwind in the untucked lounge,</i>
<i>the judges and I will</i>
<i>deliberate.</i>

34:32.805 --> 34:39.709
<i>All right, now, just between us</i>
<i>she-devils, what do you think?</i>
<i>Starting with April carrion...</i>

34:39.711 --> 34:44.414
<i> I would like to have seen a</i>
<i>little better work in the film.</i>
<i> Yeah, I think that April was</i>

34:44.416 --> 34:48.718
<i>miscast in this role.</i>
<i> Adore was the team leader,</i>
<i>and so, therefore, should she be</i>

34:48.720 --> 34:52.622
<i>held accountable for handing out</i>
<i>the jobs?</i>
<i> That's a very good point.</i>

34:52.624 --> 34:57.694
<i>All right, moving on to</i>
<i>Laganja Estranja.</i>
<i> Something about her I love.</i>

34:57.696 --> 35:01.331
<i>I think she's incredibly</i>
<i>charming.</i>
<i>The acting was...</i>

35:01.333 --> 35:05.869
<i> She didn't suck.</i>
<i> I'm saying she didn't suck.</i>
<i> I think it was partly because</i>

35:05.871 --> 35:09.639
<i>her screen partner was</i>
<i>April carrion.</i>
<i>Even tongue kissing couldn't</i>

35:09.641 --> 35:12.242
<i>save it.</i>
<i> All right, let's move on.</i>
<i>Gia Gunn.</i>

35:12.244 --> 35:16.446
<i> I just didn't feel like it</i>
<i>was her best drag.</i>
<i>As far as her performance,</i>

35:16.448 --> 35:20.884
<i>it was flat.</i>
<i> But I don't know how familiar</i>
<i>some of them are with acting.</i>

35:20.886 --> 35:24.087
<i>Age does have to do a little</i>
<i>bit with it.</i>
<i> But you were nominated for an</i>

35:24.089 --> 35:27.691
<i>academy award at 12 years old.</i>
<i> Yes, but I'd been working</i>
<i>since I was six.</i>

35:27.693 --> 35:33.830
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Let's go to Adore Delano.</i>
<i> Well, I Adore Adore.</i>

35:33.832 --> 35:36.867
<i>She's kind of like a daughter</i>
<i>i want to slap.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

35:36.869 --> 35:40.504
<i> She was kind of ill-prepared,</i>
<i>but she was good.</i>
<i> Right.</i>

35:40.506 --> 35:44.508
<i> The "bitchin'."</i>
<i>She gets it, and I think when</i>
<i>she does nurture her inner</i>

35:44.510 --> 35:47.511
<i>talent, she's gonna be</i>
<i>unstoppable.</i>
<i> Yeah, but that might be too</i>

35:47.513 --> 35:51.481
<i>late.</i>
<i>Next, Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i> This is another one who's</i>

35:51.483 --> 35:55.452
<i>a star.</i>
<i> She was incredible.</i>
<i>If de LA had been on the winning</i>

35:55.454 --> 35:59.022
<i>team, she probably would have</i>
<i>been the winner of this week's</i>
<i>challenge.</i>

35:59.024 --> 36:02.125
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>All right, moving on.</i>
<i>Vivacious.</i>

36:02.127 --> 36:07.264
<i> That look was dated.</i>
<i>I don't even know if it even</i>
<i>reads like being feminine.</i>

36:07.266 --> 36:11.268
<i> Unfortunately, she didn't</i>
<i>bring it on.</i>
<i>To be a talking head, you got to</i>

36:11.270 --> 36:16.039
<i>let it out even if you're</i>
<i>just...</i>
<i>Giving head.</i>

36:16.041 --> 36:21.178
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> But I do give her credit for</i>
<i>staying true to who she is.</i>

36:21.180 --> 36:26.983
<i> That can be a hindrance if</i>
<i>you refuse to move beyond that.</i>
<i> I beg to differ.</i>

36:26.985 --> 36:29.853
<i>She looked sad because she</i>
<i>felt inferior.</i>
<i> And then when she laughed...</i>

36:29.855 --> 36:34.591
<i>[All speaking at once]</i>
<i> Silence!</i>
<i>[Gasps]</i>

36:34.593 --> 36:42.199
<i>I've made my decision.</i>
<i>Bring back...</i>
<i>My girls.</i>

36:42.201 --> 36:45.101
<i> [Laughing]</i>

36:45.103 --> 36:52.342
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
<i>I've made some decisions.</i>
<i>Ben de LA creme...</i>

36:52.344 --> 36:58.381
<i>You're safe.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i> Vivacious, concerning your</i>

36:58.383 --> 37:04.521
<i>head, I'm afraid there've been</i>
<i>some complaints.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, my dear, but you're</i>

37:04.523 --> 37:15.865
<i>up for elimination.</i>
<i>Laganja Estranja...</i>
<i>You're safe.</i>

37:15.867 --> 37:26.309
<i>Gia Gunn...</i>
<i>You're safe.</i>
<i>Adore Delano...</i>

37:26.311 --> 37:34.851
<i>You've got real talent...</i>
<i>But do you have the discipline</i>
<i>it takes to go all the way?</i>

37:34.853 --> 37:42.125
<i>April carrion...</i>
<i>I hate to rain on your parade,</i>
<i>but your screen test was a</i>

37:42.127 --> 37:51.935
<i>washout.</i>
<i>Adore Delano...</i>
<i>You're safe.</i>

37:51.937 --> 38:01.344
<i>April, my dear, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but you are up for elimination.</i>
<i>Two queens stand before me.</i>

38:01.346 --> 38:08.652
<i>Ladies...</i>
<i>This is your last chance</i>
<i>to impress me and save yourself</i>

38:08.654 --> 38:14.157
<i>from elimination.</i>
<i>The time has come...</i>
<i>[Thunder booms]</i>

38:14.159 --> 38:18.728
<i>To lip-synch for your life.</i>

38:18.730 --> 38:27.837
<i>Good luck...</i>
<i>And don't [Bleep] it up.</i>

38:27.839 --> 38:31.474
<i> </i>

38:31.476 --> 38:33.543
<i>  everybody, everybody </i>

38:33.545 --> 38:35.245
<i> get out on the floor </i>

38:35.247 --> 38:37.314
<i> it can get a little crazy </i>

38:37.316 --> 38:38.848
<i> when the kick hits the floor </i>

38:38.850 --> 38:43.019
<i> make a scene </i>
<i> make a scene </i>
<i> nobody can ignore </i>

38:43.021 --> 38:46.756
<i> don't knock it </i>
<i> till you rock it </i>
<i> we can't take it no more </i>

38:46.758 --> 38:51.961
<i> bring the lights up </i>
<i> bust the doors down </i>
<i> dust yourself off </i>

38:51.963 --> 38:58.268
<i> shake it up, shake it up </i>
<i> dj, set it off </i>
<i> take it up a notch </i>

38:58.270 --> 39:05.475
<i> Vivacious is working me out.</i>
<i>Her style of drag is something</i>
<i>that I Adore.</i>

39:05.477 --> 39:09.245
<i>  Shake it up </i>
<i> bring the lights up </i>
<i> bust the doors down </i>

39:09.247 --> 39:13.383
<i> dust yourself off </i>
<i> shake it up, shake it up </i>
<i> shake it up </i>

39:13.385 --> 39:18.254
<i> dj, set it off </i>
<i> take it up a notch </i>
<i> all together now </i>

39:18.256 --> 39:23.593
<i> shake it up, shake it up </i>
<i> April looks like Selena Gomez</i>
<i>is right there on that stage.</i>

39:23.595 --> 39:29.566
<i>Vivacious is not missing a beat.</i>
<i>She is owning that stage.</i>
<i>At this point, it is too close</i>

39:29.568 --> 39:34.137
<i>to call.</i>
<i>  shake it up </i>
<i> shake it up </i>

39:34.139 --> 39:37.407
<i>[applause]</i>

39:37.409 --> 39:48.318
<i> Ladies, I've made my</i>
<i>decision.</i>

39:48.320 --> 40:00.730
<i>April carrion, shante.</i>
<i>You stay.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

40:00.732 --> 40:09.472
<i> You may join the other girls.</i>
<i> Vivacious...</i>
<i>We love you.</i>

40:09.474 --> 40:18.848
<i>Keep giving them life, mama.</i>
<i>Now sashay away.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

40:18.850 --> 40:29.025
<i> What I do some might</i>
<i>consider a dying art, and</i>
<i>look-wise, I may have been</i>

40:29.027 --> 40:34.597
<i>misunderstood by some of the</i>
<i>queens, but this is my way of</i>
<i>preserving the legacy of where</i>

40:34.599 --> 40:44.474
<i>i came from.</i>
<i>Ru, mother, thank you forever.</i>
<i> Condragulations, my killer</i>

40:44.476 --> 40:49.345
<i>queens.</i>
<i>Now, remember, if you can't love</i>
<i>yourself, how in the...</i>

40:49.347 --> 40:52.782
<i>[Deep, scary voice] Hell...</i>
<i>[Normal voice] you gonna love</i>
<i>somebody else?</i>

40:52.784 --> 40:57.787
<i>Can I get a "amen" in here?</i>
<i> All: Amen.</i>
