MY LITTLE GIRL.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.508

MR. FERGUSON'S BABY?

- YOU LYIN'.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.442

I DON'T HAVE THE CHILD,
AND IF I DID,

I WOULDN'T LET HER

TO BELIEVE HIM.

- AIN'T GOT NO REASON
NOT TO.

- THAT'S TRUE.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.279
- ELAM, DON'T.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.595
BUT THAT DON'T GIVE US
MUCH TIME.

WE COULD GET WASHED OUT.

- MOVING THIS TOWN
MORE IMPORTANT

03:34.915 --> 03:36.317
THAN FINDING
ME AND EVA BABY?

03:36.417 --> 03:38.319
- I AIN'T SAID THAT.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.888

03:56.504 --> 03:58.639
YOU DON'T WORK,
YOU DON'T GET PAID.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.941
- IF THERE'S NO PAY,
YOU'LL HAVE NO MEN.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.976
- THAT'S RIGHT!
- WE'LL WALK OFF THIS RAILROAD.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.378

WE GOT JOBS TO DO, BUT SPEAKING
ON BEHALF OF THE FREEDMEN,

WE GOT TO FIND ELAM'S BABY
BEFORE WE DO MUCH ANYTHING ELSE.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.620

HOW YOU CONDUCT YOURS,

05:03.904 --> 05:06.039
BUT SURELY YOU WOULD AGREE

05:06.139 --> 05:10.711
A SHORT DELAY IS IN ORDER
UNTIL THE CHILD IS FOUND.

THIS AIN'T YOUR FAULT.

WE WAS ONLY OUT THE HOUSE
A MINUTE.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.132
BOHANNON GOT A SEARCH--

06:39.232 --> 06:40.934

FIND HER, ELAM.

IT'S THE CURSE ON ME

06:42.603 --> 06:44.071
FOR ALL THE WRONG I DONE
TO MR. TOOLE.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.939

WAS GONNA HAPPEN, AND IT DID.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.943
IT HAPPENED.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.781
- STOP THAT, WOMAN.
I WANT YOU TO STOP THAT.

06:53.881 --> 06:58.619
THAT'S FOOLISH TALK.
IT AIN'T NO CURSE.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.522
SOMEBODY DONE TOOK OUR BABY
OUT THIS CAMP, THAT'S ALL.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.924
I'M GONNA BRING OUR BABY
BACK TO US.

I'M GONNA MAKE
ALL THIS RIGHT AGAIN, EVA.

07:11.298 --> 07:14.201
I PROMISE YOU.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.140
EVA, YOU HEAR ME, WOMAN?

07:35.589 --> 07:36.857
- HMM.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.892
- RAIL CARS HAVE ALL
BEEN SEARCHED,

07:38.992 --> 07:43.964
THE HOTEL, WHORE TENTS,
AND SLAUGHTERHOUSE AS WELL.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.801
THERE'S A LOT OF MUDSILLS
AND SHIT HEELS IN THIS CAMP,

07:47.901 --> 07:52.005
MURDERERS, LAYABOUTS,
BACKSTABBERS.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.010
- YES, SIR.

RIGHT WHEN THAT BABY'S TOOK
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MOVE CAMP,

08:02.049 --> 08:05.485
AND HE OFFERS A REWARD

08:05.586 --> 08:08.488
THAT FURTHER SLOWS
OUR PROGRESS.

08:11.592 --> 08:16.196

ABOUT THAT, WOULD YOU, SEAN?

IS ABOUT TO LEAVE TOWN

08:36.216 --> 08:38.586

08:38.686 --> 08:42.522
IF THAT'S ANY HELP.

08:42.623 --> 08:46.193

MY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.111
I'M AFRAID.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.681
I TRUST THE SEARCH WILL CONTINUE
IN MY ABSENCE.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.784
- THAT BABY DIDN'T GO MISSING
TILL YOU GOT HERE.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.638
HE KNOWS.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.640
HE AS MUCH AS SAID SO.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.742
- SEAN, IF HE KNEW,

10:08.842 --> 10:13.046
YOU WOULD HAVE A HOLE
IN YOUR HEAD RIGHT THERE.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.316
FIND YOUR MANHOOD
AND EMBRACE IT.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.686

[knocks on carriage]

10:20.420 --> 10:23.256
[man whistles, shouts]

10:29.262 --> 10:31.164

THEY WAS RIGHT THERE,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.200
TACKED AND READY TO MOVE OUT,
AND THEN THEY WAS GONE.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.202
- TWO HORSES ALL THEY TOOK?
- AND THE TACK.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.037
HELL, THE TACK'S WORTH
MORE THAN THE HORSES.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.806

THEY WENT STRAIGHT SOUTH.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.808

- HE'S RIGHT. IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE RUSTLING TO ME.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.886
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS, WHAT WOULD
HORSE THIEVES WANT WITH A BABY?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.022
- BUT BABY THIEVES
NEED HORSES, SURE.

10:55.122 --> 10:59.259
- WHERE YOU GOING?
- DROP MY REINS.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.094
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE, ELAM,

11:01.194 --> 11:02.796
OR IF THEY EVEN HAVE THE BABY.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.799

THIS GOT TO BE THEM.

11:05.899 --> 11:10.003

13:37.484 --> 13:39.352
- DENVER?
- THAT'S WHERE THAT TRAIL LEADS.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.955
OTHER ONE LEADS
TO AN OLD SURVEYOR CAMP.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.057
AIN'T NOTHIN' FOR 'EM THERE.
- DENVER 150 MILES FROM HERE.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.959
THEY GET TO DENVER,
SHE GONE FOR GOOD.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.227
- SHE AIN'T GOT
HER MAMA'S MILK.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.897
HOW'S SHE GONNA MAKE IT
TO DENVER?

13:49.997 --> 13:52.465
- SHE AIN'T.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.245
- HA!

14:25.966 --> 14:29.002
- IT'S DECLAN TOOLE.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.004
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:31.104 --> 14:33.941
- MAY I COME IN?
- GO AWAY.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.981
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

14:56.563 --> 15:01.001
- [grunting]

15:09.576 --> 15:11.611
- NOW, WE GONNA TALK SOME.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.982
YOU HOLLER,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.550
I'M GONNA GUT YOU LIKE A FISH.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.320
YOU HEAR?

15:23.590 --> 15:27.160
- [grunts]

15:32.399 --> 15:35.635
[coughs]

15:37.304 --> 15:40.407
I'M A NEW YORK CITY COPPER.
- OUT HERE...

15:42.609 --> 15:44.577
THAT DON'T MAKE
NO NEVERMIND.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.614
- ENOUGH!

15:47.714 --> 15:49.549
I'VE NOT TAKEN THE CHILD.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.351
I WAS LOOKING FOR HER,
SAME AS YOU.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.653
- YOU WAS LOOKING FOR HER
IN ELAM TENT?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.322
THAT DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.358
- WHY WOULD I TAKE
THE BABY?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.598
- ON ACCOUNT OF YOU DON'T WANT
NO NEGROES RAISING HER UP,

16:05.698 --> 16:09.069
THAT'S WHY.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.639
- SHE'S MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD,
SHE IS,

16:12.739 --> 16:15.575
AND I'D DO NOTHING
TO ENDANGER THAT CHILD.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.516
- YOU TELL ME,
WHERE MY BABY NIECE AT?

16:23.616 --> 16:26.086
HMM?

16:31.791 --> 16:33.726
- EASY.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.702
- I DON'T SEE NO HORSES.

16:42.802 --> 16:46.406
- DAMN IT, ELAM.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.068
[rustling]

17:17.504 --> 17:19.706
WHAT?
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.514
- THIS IS HERS.

17:32.385 --> 17:36.189
- IT'S A FOOL'S ERRAND.
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.057
YOU GOT THE WHOLE STORY
RIGHT THERE.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.260
- WE DON'T KNOW
IF SHE DEAD OR ALIVE.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.529
- WHAT YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.198
I AIN'T GONNA STOP
TILL I DO.

17:45.298 --> 17:49.068
- MIGHT BE BEST
YOU NEVER KNOW.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.647
- YOU KILLED THEM MEN.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.851
WASN'T TO BRING
YOUR FAMILY BACK.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.854
WHY?

18:07.954 --> 18:11.824
MADE YOU FEEL BETTER?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.494
IT GIVE YOU PEACE?

18:17.230 --> 18:20.533
YOU GO ON BACK
IF YOU WANT.

18:20.633 --> 18:24.504
I'M GONNA GO DO WHAT I GOT TO DO
FOR MY LITTLE GIRL.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.719
HA!

18:39.819 --> 18:41.788
COME ON!

18:41.888 --> 18:44.591
HA!

18:48.861 --> 18:51.764
- SHIT.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.750
- EVA.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.566
EVA.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.305
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.713
- SHE'S BETTER OFF...

19:40.813 --> 19:43.316
AWAY FROM ME.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.289
I COULDN'T GIVE HER NOTHING.

19:49.389 --> 19:53.493
- YOU COULD GIVE HER
A MOTHER'S LOVE.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.663
- YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT IT.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.734
- EVA.

20:01.834 --> 20:06.606
EVA, THERE--THERE WAS A TIME
I WAS INTIMATE WITH JOSEPH.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.611
IT DESTROYED MY FATHER,
BUT...

20:11.711 --> 20:14.714
I HAD FALLEN INTO DARKNESS
AND SIN.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.987
AS TIME WENT ON, I...

20:23.656 --> 20:26.759
DISCOVERED I...

20:26.859 --> 20:29.396
WAS WITH CHILD.

20:35.702 --> 20:39.272
I WAS FRIGHTENED.

20:43.075 --> 20:47.747
MM.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.382
I...

20:49.482 --> 20:51.250
THOUGHT THROUGH
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES

20:51.351 --> 20:55.021
IF I WERE TO HAVE THE CHILD,
AND...

20:56.923 --> 20:59.859
NONE OF THEM WERE GOOD.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.663
I PRAYED TO THE LORD
EVERY NIGHT TO...

21:04.964 --> 21:08.034
TAKE IT AWAY.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.807
THEN...

21:14.907 --> 21:17.410
NATURE TOOK ITS COURSE.

21:22.482 --> 21:26.986
I WAS NOT TO BE A MOTHER,
AND I FELT...

21:27.086 --> 21:30.022
UNWORTHY OF GOD'S LOVE.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.425
I WAS A SINNER...

21:35.061 --> 21:38.798
AND I HAD SINNED.

21:41.934 --> 21:45.638
BUT GOD DID NOT SPURN ME...

21:45.738 --> 21:47.507
AS OTHERS SURELY WOULD HAVE.

21:47.607 --> 21:52.345
EVEN THOUGH I HAD BEEN THINKING
EVIL THOUGHTS,

21:52.445 --> 21:54.080
HE WAS NOT ASHAMED OF ME.

21:54.180 --> 21:58.885
THE GOOD LORD GAVE ME PERMISSION
TO FEEL HOW I WAS FEELING,

21:58.985 --> 22:03.322
AND HOWEVER YOU'RE FEELING
RIGHT NOW, EVA,

22:03.423 --> 22:07.059
IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH HIM.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.062
THE GOOD LORD
HAS INFINITE CAPACITY

22:10.162 --> 22:12.098
TO TAKE OUR SINS.

22:18.905 --> 22:22.041
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LET HIM.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.758
- [sighs]

22:42.028 --> 22:44.964
[sobbing]

22:47.767 --> 22:50.437
- SHH. SHH.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.573
- [continues sobbing]

22:55.942 --> 22:58.778
- SHH.

23:04.451 --> 23:07.153
- [gags]

23:07.253 --> 23:10.890
[breathing heavily]

23:13.826 --> 23:17.464
UGH.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.570
THERE'S KINDNESS
IN YOU YET, PSALMS.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.872
- NOT MUCH.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.007
- [chuckles]

23:31.478 --> 23:33.813
YOU WERE NAMED
FOR A BOOK IN THE BIBLE.

23:33.913 --> 23:34.914
- MM-HMM.

23:35.014 --> 23:38.184
MY MAMA NAMED ME
AFTER VERSE 37,

23:38.284 --> 23:41.020
THE ONE ABOUT GOD
SLAYING THE WICKED

23:41.120 --> 23:44.557
AND OFFERING COMFORT
TO THE SUFFERING.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.096
- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

23:50.196 --> 23:54.166
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.837
- IS IT CHRISTIAN?

23:57.937 --> 24:00.039
- I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
GIVE ME BACK THAT BABY.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.608
THAT'S CHRISTIAN ENOUGH.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.075
- I CAN'T GIVE YOU
WHAT I DON'T HAVE.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.077
[chuckles]

24:05.177 --> 24:06.946
YOU'VE GIVEN ME
ENOUGH PUCKS TO THE FACE

24:07.046 --> 24:10.850
FOR ME TO CONFESS BY NOW.

24:13.586 --> 24:16.856
- YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KILL ME...

24:16.956 --> 24:19.492
OR LET ME GO.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.563
YOU'RE NOT A KILLER,
PSALMS.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.733
- YOU THINK YOU'D BE
THE FIRST WHITE MAN I EVER KILT?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.604
- YOU GAVE ME WATER...

24:31.704 --> 24:34.807
COMFORT.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.243
YOU DON'T WANT THE BLOOD
OF AN INNOCENT MAN

24:37.343 --> 24:41.648
WEIGHING ON YOUR SOUL.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.850
RELEASE ME,

24:43.950 --> 24:47.219
AND I SWEAR BY HOLY MARY,

24:47.319 --> 24:49.622
THE MOTHER OF GOD,

24:49.722 --> 24:52.959
I WON'T RAISE A MOB
AGAINST YOU.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.931
- ALL MY LIFE...

24:59.031 --> 25:02.268
I DONE DID
WHAT THE WHITE MAN TOLD ME...

25:02.368 --> 25:05.705
SO HE WON'T KILL ME.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.507
WHITE MAN TELL ME
WHEN TO WORK,

25:08.608 --> 25:11.911
WHERE TO WORK,
HOW LONG TO WORK.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.245
MM.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.915
WHITE MAN GIVE ME
WHAT FOOD HE GOT LEFT OVER,

25:16.015 --> 25:18.718
NOT WHAT HE GOT TO SHARE.

25:18.818 --> 25:22.521
WHITE MAN TAKE
ALL THE BEST WOMEN FOR HISSELF,

25:22.622 --> 25:25.091
EVEN TAKE OUT
THE BEST PART OF THE BIBLE.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.093
MM-HMM.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.995
SEE, WHITE MAN DON'T LEAVE MUCH
FOR OLD PSALMS

25:29.095 --> 25:32.064
EXCEPT FOR WHAT HE DON'T WANT
FOR HISSELF.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.066
MM.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.135
BUT OLD PSALMS--

25:36.235 --> 25:38.204
HE GET THE LAST LAUGH.

25:38.304 --> 25:42.041
HMM, MR. TOOLE?

25:42.141 --> 25:46.278
NOW, YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHERE SHE IS,

25:46.378 --> 25:48.948
OR MOTHER MARY

25:49.048 --> 25:51.951
GONNA SIT RIGHT HERE WITH ME

25:52.051 --> 25:54.086
AND WATCH YOU DIE.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.796
[hoofbeats approaching,
horses whinnying]

26:37.263 --> 26:38.831
- WHERE'S MY BABY?
- I'M SORRY.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.599
- WHERE IS SHE?
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.169
- CAN'T TELL YOU IF HE'S DEAD,
NOW, CAN HE?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.617
- I THOUGHT WE'D BE
IN DENVER BY NOW.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.988
- SHE'S FINE--
A REAL SWEET CHILD.

27:02.088 --> 27:05.692
I THINK SHE'S
GETTING HUNGRY, THOUGH.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.636
PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.038
- ELAM.
- HE DONE IT FOR ME.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.807
- KILLING THEM WON'T MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.241
- IT MIGHT.

27:26.478 --> 27:30.717
- WE DIDN'T MEAN NO HARM.
WE WAS GONNA BE A FAMILY.

27:30.817 --> 27:34.353
IT DIDN'T SEEM
EVA WANTED THIS BABY.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.096
- WE GOT HER NOW.
LET'S GO.

27:53.239 --> 27:56.743
- SARA'S BLEEDING BAD.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.078
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.747
- CAN SHE RIDE?

28:00.847 --> 28:02.681
- NOT MUCH
AND NOT FOR LONG.

28:02.782 --> 28:06.753
- WE GOT TO GO.
MY BABY GIRL GETTIN' HUNGRY.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.357
- YOU TAKE THIS AND RIDE ON.

28:11.457 --> 28:15.127
COME BACK TO HELL ON WHEELS,
I'LL HANG YOU BOTH.

28:15.227 --> 28:18.731
YOU RUN INTO INDIANS,
YOU HOLD TWO OF THESE BACK--

28:18.831 --> 28:20.199
ONE FOR HER, ONE FOR YOU.

28:20.299 --> 28:23.035
HER FIRST.

28:23.135 --> 28:27.439
- LEAVE 'EM BE.
WE GOT TO RIDE.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.708
- MR. BOHANNON...

28:29.809 --> 28:31.878
DON'T LEAVE US OUT HERE.

28:31.978 --> 28:35.147
- WE ALL BEEN LEFT
OUT HERE, SON.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.853
[train bell ringing]

28:40.953 --> 28:43.756
[train whistle blows]

28:54.400 --> 28:57.403
- I HEAR YOU'RE GETTING READY
TO MOVE THE TRAINS.

29:00.406 --> 29:04.410
- I'M READY TO MOVE
THE TRAINS, YES.

29:04.510 --> 29:08.314
- EVEN THOUGH MR. BOHANNON
ISN'T YET BACK WITH THE BABY.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.049
- MM-HMM.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.284
AND WHO KNOWS
WHEN HE WILL BE?

29:12.384 --> 29:16.422
- THAT'D PROBABLY SUIT YOU,
WOULDN'T IT?

29:16.522 --> 29:19.158
- WHEN MR. BOHANNON
COMES BACK,

29:19.258 --> 29:21.493
HIS TRAIN IS READY,
ALL RIGHT?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.195
- AND IF HE DOESN'T,

29:23.295 --> 29:28.267
THE TRAIN WILL BE READY
FOR YOUR FRIEND, MR. DURANT.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.437
- I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

29:31.537 --> 29:36.275
RUN ALONG BACK TO YOUR WHORES,
ALL RIGHT?

29:36.375 --> 29:41.280
- YOU'RE PLAYING A VERY
DANGEROUS GAME HERE, SEAN-O.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.984
THE WRONG BET MAY COST YOU
YOUR LIFE, MAN.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.956
- SMART MONEY
ALWAYS HEDGES ITS BET.

29:50.056 --> 29:54.426
- THE SMART MONEY'S
ON BOHANNON.

30:53.652 --> 30:57.423
[baby cries]

31:11.470 --> 31:14.106
[baby fussing]

31:32.558 --> 31:35.027
- LOOK HERE.

31:35.127 --> 31:38.530
SHE DOIN' IT.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.300
- I'LL BE DAMNED
IF SHE AIN'T.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.577
[exhales sharply]
WEATHER'S GETTING CLOSE.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.479
- HOW YOU KNOW?

31:53.579 --> 31:56.448
- CAUGHT A BULLET
IN THE WAR.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.952
MY KNEE SWELLS UP EVERY TIME
THE WEATHER'S COMING.

32:00.052 --> 32:03.022
- [baby coos]
- YOU DONE ENOUGH.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.924
GO ON BACK.
MOVE THE CAMP.

32:06.025 --> 32:09.328
WE'LL BE ALONG DIRECTLY.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.966
- WHAT WAS YOU DOING
OUT THERE?

32:19.471 --> 32:22.374
- I'M ONLY GONNA
SAY THIS ONCE.

32:25.144 --> 32:28.214
THIS HERE BABY WHITE.
I KNOW THAT.

32:30.616 --> 32:35.121
I DO, BUT SHE MINE.

32:35.221 --> 32:38.624
I DON'T CARE
WHAT COLOR SHE IS.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.126
SHE MINE.

32:42.561 --> 32:46.965
SHE AIN'T GOT
NO OTHER FATHER BUT ME.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.102
WHO ELSE GONNA LOVE HER?

32:50.202 --> 32:53.705
- ELAM...

32:56.175 --> 32:59.578
THAT BABY AIN'T GONNA BRING YOU
NOTHING BUT A HEAP OF TROUBLE

32:59.678 --> 33:03.615
AND PAIN
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

33:03.715 --> 33:07.653
DON'T MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK.

33:07.753 --> 33:12.024
- MY FAMILY WAS TOOK FROM ME,
JUST LIKE YOURS.

33:12.124 --> 33:15.594
AND SHE THE FIRST THING
I EVER GOT...

33:17.663 --> 33:20.599
THAT'S MINE, ALL MY OWN.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.436
I'M KEEPING HER.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.508
SEE HER GROW UP...

33:29.608 --> 33:32.411
REAL SMART, REAL PRETTY.

33:35.547 --> 33:39.551
SHE GONNA KNOW
I'M HER DADDY...

33:39.651 --> 33:42.054
AND I LOVE HER.

33:45.657 --> 33:49.061
- TELL YOU TRUE, ELAM.

33:49.161 --> 33:52.498
YOU'D DO BEST TO UNWRAP
YOUR HEART FROM HER RIGHT NOW.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.203
I CAN'T DO THAT.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.571
IT'S TOO LATE.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.441
