01:05.825 --> 01:07.726
-

01:16.605 --> 01:19.243
I was a tender
12 years old the first time

01:19.278 --> 01:23.115
I experienced a deep and
painful loss.

01:24.481 --> 01:27.185
The cause of her death
is still a mystery to me.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.288
And I often wonder if there
was anything I could have done

01:31.323 --> 01:32.487
to prevent it.

01:33.756 --> 01:37.393
I remember finding
her pale, little body floating

01:37.428 --> 01:39.692
in the cold, cruel water.

01:40.728 --> 01:43.762
My mother and stepfather
barely acknowledged
what happened,

01:44.633 --> 01:48.107
which made the grieving
process even more confusing.

01:48.868 --> 01:51.506
Being able to persevere
through this tragic loss

01:51.541 --> 01:56.280
helped me to become
the strong leader I am today.

01:57.646 --> 02:00.779
And that is why I am
the perfect candidate

02:01.485 --> 02:03.518
for Northwestern's
liberal arts program.

02:05.390 --> 02:06.488
Goddamn. I'm good.

02:07.557 --> 02:09.755
Suck my dick, Emily Dickinson.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.527
Madison!
Can you check on the turkey?

02:22.407 --> 02:23.868
Okay.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.476
Let's do this.

02:36.751 --> 02:38.256
Haha. Boom.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.917
Honey,
check the temperature first.

02:40.425 --> 02:42.788
Yes, Mom. I got it.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.164
Already did that...

02:45.529 --> 02:46.924
Put the rolls in the oven.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.299
Fine.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.270
They're not in the fridge.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.436
No,
they're in the freezer.

02:56.441 --> 02:59.178
Yeah, that would be great.
Actually, that reminds me...

02:59.444 --> 03:01.444
Oh, honey.
Will you also pull out the gin?

03:04.977 --> 03:06.284
It's not in the freezer.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.615
Yeah, no,
it's in the fridge.

03:07.650 --> 03:10.651
Ugh. This house is so backwards.

03:14.657 --> 03:18.428
- Got ya!
-  Holy shit! Jimmy!

03:18.595 --> 03:20.430
You scared me!

03:23.864 --> 03:24.863
Mm! Oh, oh.

03:25.765 --> 03:29.604
I am wearing the necklace
you gave me.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.210
I gave you that?

03:32.004 --> 03:33.443
This morning!

03:33.478 --> 03:34.277
Oh!

03:34.743 --> 03:36.215
It looks so different
outside the box.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.614
Honey, did you make sure
that the turkey was 165 degrees?

03:40.419 --> 03:41.583
Madison! I'm speaking to you!

03:41.618 --> 03:43.585
Mm-hmm. Yep. Mom, I checked it.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.817
It's done.

03:44.852 --> 03:46.456
So, honey,
you're sure it's done?

03:48.493 --> 03:50.493
The thermometer said 165.

03:51.727 --> 03:52.726
Well...

03:53.795 --> 03:55.028
Just because it's dark doesn't
mean it's cooked.

03:55.063 --> 03:58.237
165 degrees. How would you know
that when you're doing that?

03:58.932 --> 04:00.734
Because I can read, Mom.

04:00.769 --> 04:02.571
It's all right. I'll just put it
right back in. Excuse me.

04:02.606 --> 04:04.606
- What? Seriously?
- Just for a second.

04:04.641 --> 04:06.308
No, Mom. I checked it.
It's done.

04:06.343 --> 04:07.842
You know what, I just want to
put it in, so we can make sure
it's crispy and safe.

04:07.878 --> 04:10.414
- Why don't I help with that,
Mrs. Williams?
- No! You do not have to help

04:10.449 --> 04:11.382
with that because it's done.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.383
Okay. Okay.
- No, it's not done.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.417
Why can you not trust that
I can do anything?

04:13.452 --> 04:15.782
This is not about you.
This is about the turkey.

04:15.817 --> 04:17.619
- The turkey is done!
- The turkey crisps--

04:17.654 --> 04:19.654
Oh my God. Oh! It's so hot!
It's so hot!

04:52.018 --> 04:53.523
This corn is uh...

04:54.493 --> 04:55.492
tender.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.892
Yeah. This is a good
opportunity to really
appreciate the sides

04:59.927 --> 05:03.731
of a dinner and uh...
not focus so much on the turkey.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.964
Yeah. Yeah.

05:06.934 --> 05:08.439
Kids make mistakes all the time.

05:12.676 --> 05:15.006
I'm not a kid.
I am 18 years old.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.374
And it was an accident, Mom.

05:16.409 --> 05:19.945
- And some might say that
you were involved.
Hey. Hey! What...

05:20.717 --> 05:21.848
What did everyone do today?

05:22.114 --> 05:24.015
Oh! Dad and I built a snowman.

05:24.050 --> 05:27.425
Oh yeah. It's the, uh,
lump of snow outside
with my, uh, clothes on.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.591
Well, that's great!

05:29.961 --> 05:32.463
Madison, did you finish
that essay for
your college application?

05:32.861 --> 05:33.860
Yeah.

05:34.796 --> 05:36.665
Yeah, Uncle Andy.
I--I actually did. Um--

05:36.700 --> 05:37.633
Great.

05:37.668 --> 05:40.097
Mom, did you have a chance
to read it yet?

05:42.739 --> 05:43.738
I did.

05:45.544 --> 05:46.576
And?

05:48.547 --> 05:51.647
Honestly, I don't think there's
any college that's gonna
accept that essay.

05:53.013 --> 05:54.353
What are you talking about?

05:55.015 --> 05:56.652
Did you really write
about Goldie?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.489
Who's Goldie?

05:58.887 --> 06:00.986
You wrote about your
dead goldfish?

06:01.659 --> 06:04.594
Look, I know you're upset
with me, but Madison,
you could do better.

06:04.629 --> 06:08.862
I do not even know why
I bothered to ask your opinion

06:08.897 --> 06:09.963
on the essay in the first place.

06:09.998 --> 06:11.997
I mean, you seize every single
opportunity you can

06:12.032 --> 06:13.031
to criticize me,
so there's that.

06:15.805 --> 06:18.135
Why didn't you write about
the special bond you have
with Heather?

06:18.643 --> 06:19.642
Don't write about me.

06:20.645 --> 06:21.310
Look, I don't know
what's taking so long.

06:21.345 --> 06:22.513
It's not like you have a job.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.010
Maybe something more interesting
would happen if you just

06:25.045 --> 06:26.044
left the house.

06:30.622 --> 06:34.019
Hey, I was looking
through your photo albums,

06:34.054 --> 06:35.757
and mini-Madison was so cute.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.397
Aw. Thanks, Jimmy.

06:38.663 --> 06:40.729
Remember when mini-Madison
wanted to grow up to be a dog?

06:40.764 --> 06:43.897
Uh-huh.
- Aw, you wanted to be
a little mini-muffin?

06:44.130 --> 06:46.097
Well, there's nothing wrong with
taking social cues

06:46.132 --> 06:47.604
from man's best friend.

06:47.639 --> 06:49.166
Mmm, she used to put the food
on the floor

06:49.201 --> 06:50.640
and try to eat
without her hands.

06:50.807 --> 06:52.543
- Well--

06:52.578 --> 06:55.040
Okay, think we're done
with this subject.

06:55.075 --> 06:57.174
We could probably move on now,
right?

06:57.209 --> 06:58.978
Oh my God, she also pooped on
the front lawn.

06:59.013 --> 07:00.078
No, she didn't!
-  Dude, yes!

07:00.113 --> 07:01.684
- Oh, she did!
- So many times!

07:23.609 --> 07:24.707
There you are.

07:29.846 --> 07:31.142
I come bearing gifts.

07:35.852 --> 07:36.983
Come on.

07:37.216 --> 07:38.952
We were just joking around.

07:51.835 --> 07:53.736
I know. They took it
a little too far.

07:54.607 --> 07:57.773
But, I like being reminded
of mini-Madison.

08:14.154 --> 08:17.287
I'm just so sick of my parents
still treating me like a child.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.564
My mother doesn't appreciate
any of the hard work I'm doing.

08:19.599 --> 08:24.261
Heather is a grade-A bitch.
And--and--and Uncle Andy just...

08:24.296 --> 08:26.230
It's like he's the only person
who--

08:28.575 --> 08:29.607
Seriously?

08:30.709 --> 08:31.708
What?

08:32.172 --> 08:33.776
No, no, no! No, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!

08:34.141 --> 08:36.614
I was listening.
I promise I was listening.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.044
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:38.211 --> 08:39.914
Heather is a grade-A bitch.

08:42.886 --> 08:45.590
I'm sorry. Just talk to me.

08:47.825 --> 08:49.154
I don't know. I just--

08:49.662 --> 08:51.695
I just wish
they'd leave me alone.

08:52.027 --> 08:54.192
Like, like,
give me my own space.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.600
Maybe even my own room.

08:56.064 --> 08:58.636
Like, sharing a room with
Heather is not exactly

08:58.671 --> 09:01.166
my favorite thing in the world.
You know?

09:01.641 --> 09:03.839
Ugh. I'm 18. Just like let me--

09:03.874 --> 09:05.577
- You know what we need?
- What?

09:05.975 --> 09:07.645
- A vacation.
- Ha. Yeah.

09:07.944 --> 09:09.273
Yeah, that's what--

09:10.078 --> 09:12.650
Whoa, I'm not looking at
my phone. Look. I promise.

09:12.685 --> 09:15.081
No, it's not...it's not that.

09:16.183 --> 09:18.018
There's a light on at
the Becker's house.

09:19.087 --> 09:20.185
And?

09:20.352 --> 09:22.253
And they're not home.

09:25.324 --> 09:26.697
I do not see a light.

09:27.799 --> 09:29.326
Well something
must have turned it off.

09:30.762 --> 09:33.132
- Maybe the house is haunted.
-  Yeah.
Definitely.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.673
Hey! It makes sense. Ghosts mess
with lights all the time.

09:35.708 --> 09:36.607
It's like a common fact.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.302
We should go over there
and check it out.

09:41.208 --> 09:43.043
You want to go
into the haunted house?

09:44.046 --> 09:45.980
It's not actually haunted,
Jimmy.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.785
There is no way you're going
to convince me

09:48.985 --> 09:50.248
to go into a haunted house.

09:55.992 --> 09:58.157
Mr. and Mrs. Becker?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.701
It's Madison.

10:03.736 --> 10:04.999
Hello?

10:13.405 --> 10:15.746
How long do you think it's been
since someone was here?

10:16.276 --> 10:19.145
A few months. Probably.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.621
Are you sure you saw
a light turn on?

10:23.756 --> 10:25.855
Must've been bad wiring.

10:26.385 --> 10:27.956
Or bad ghosts.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.900
Well, if you're convinced
there's ghosts,
we could always...

10:38.199 --> 10:40.100
have a seance.

10:41.169 --> 10:44.775
I am convinced there are ghosts.
And I don't want to meet them.

10:45.404 --> 10:47.811
Jimmy. We have two options.
Okay?

10:48.275 --> 10:51.848
Either, we can stay here,
talk to some ghosts,

10:51.883 --> 10:56.017
or, uh, we can go back and
talk to my angry mom.

10:56.382 --> 10:57.887
Ugh.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.318
Fine. Fuck it.

11:02.058 --> 11:03.354
- Let's talk to some ghosts.
- Hm.

11:07.096 --> 11:09.932
-

11:11.034 --> 11:13.738
What kind of person punches an
innocent snowman in the face?

11:13.773 --> 11:16.301
Oh, chill out, dude.
It looked like
your ex-boyfriend.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.040
What? No, it didn't.
What do you want?

11:19.075 --> 11:22.307
Uh, listen. Could you cover for
me and Jimmy for a bit?

11:23.310 --> 11:25.178
I mean, Mom and Dad
are pretty hammered,

11:25.213 --> 11:27.345
Uncle Andy is gonna stay over.

11:28.084 --> 11:29.446
You probably have some time.

11:30.284 --> 11:32.790
Okay. Can you just like stuff
some pillows in my bed?

11:32.825 --> 11:34.451
Make it look like I'm sleeping?

11:35.762 --> 11:37.960
I don't know if I want to
traumatize Dad like that again.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.360
You're going to prom this year,
right?

11:43.836 --> 11:46.430
Well, I would be
honored to supply you

11:46.465 --> 11:50.742
with a bottle of booze
as a token of my appreciation.

11:51.404 --> 11:53.305
- Two.
-  Absolutely.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.372
Deal.

11:58.444 --> 12:00.081
Perfect.

12:00.248 --> 12:02.721
- What is this?

12:03.449 --> 12:05.020
Oh. It's a Hodag.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.353
- A Ho-bag?
-  No. Hodag.

12:08.927 --> 12:11.389
He's a mythical creature.
It's a Northwoods thing.

12:12.326 --> 12:14.458
Hm. Well, whatever it is,

12:14.493 --> 12:17.065
it's going to be our official
seance mascot.

12:17.463 --> 12:19.771
- Oh, shit!
- Jimmy!

12:20.840 --> 12:22.400
Is it bad luck to break
a ho-bag?

12:26.538 --> 12:30.177
Oh, great Hodag spirit.

12:31.015 --> 12:33.015
We ask for your forgiveness

12:33.512 --> 12:39.516
and help us ward off the evil
spirits present in this house.

12:43.159 --> 12:44.058
And now,

12:45.194 --> 12:48.426
we will drink
the ceremonial Hodag blood.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.429
Is there paint in this?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.904
No. It's beer
with green food dye.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.499
- Ooh. Nice.
- Cheers.

13:00.143 --> 13:03.408
Ah. Okay. Put your hands on
the indicator thing.

13:09.482 --> 13:10.514
What do you want to ask them?

13:12.320 --> 13:15.387
Mm. What they want.

13:17.127 --> 13:18.830
Spirits.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.162
What do you want?

13:29.601 --> 13:30.809
Holy shit.

13:31.174 --> 13:32.943
- It's moving.

13:34.177 --> 13:35.176
S.

13:35.948 --> 13:36.847
You're moving this, aren't you?

13:36.883 --> 13:39.180
No! I swear to God,
I'm not moving this.

13:39.446 --> 13:41.545
S, E...

13:41.580 --> 13:43.580
I can't believe it's moving.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.549
S, E...

13:46.090 --> 13:47.254
X.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.926
Sex.

13:49.357 --> 13:50.356
Sex?

13:51.258 --> 13:52.897
Oh, you're saying you want
to have sex?

13:52.932 --> 13:55.163
- Jimmy!
- Hey, I'm fine with it.

13:55.198 --> 13:57.594
But, just to be clear,
for the record,
it was your idea.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.937
Oh, it was my idea? Really?
It was? Shut up.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.202
Hodag as my witness.

14:29.232 --> 14:31.001
A Hodag ghost?

14:32.939 --> 14:34.235
That's not good.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.175
Protected.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.358
Whoa! Oh!
Jimmy! Jimmy! Hey, hey!

14:58.393 --> 14:59.898
- We gotta get up. Come on.
-

15:00.131 --> 15:01.064
No, Jimmy. Seriously.

15:01.099 --> 15:03.594
- Wake up. Get up. Come on!
-

15:03.629 --> 15:05.035
- Whoa!
-

15:06.071 --> 15:08.236
-

15:18.248 --> 15:19.478
Oh, my God.

15:20.679 --> 15:22.382
Do you think anyone else
is in here?

15:23.550 --> 15:25.154
- Is anyone in here?
- Jimmy!

15:32.559 --> 15:34.460
We weren't this high
last night.

15:38.235 --> 15:39.432
Where's their TV?

15:40.732 --> 15:42.402
I think they were robbed.

15:43.339 --> 15:44.503
Do you think they got our weed?

15:44.703 --> 15:46.076
Shit!

15:46.705 --> 15:48.309
The gremlin prostitute's gone.

15:48.344 --> 15:50.949
How did we sleep through
a robbery?

15:51.314 --> 15:52.544
Hodag's revenge.

15:52.579 --> 15:54.678
Okay. Well, we--we have to
call the police.

15:54.713 --> 15:57.714
What? No! No, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

15:58.123 --> 15:59.551
We can't call the police.

15:59.586 --> 16:01.190
We'll get in trouble
for breaking and entering!

16:01.225 --> 16:02.224
Uh, no, we won't.

16:03.327 --> 16:05.161
But we did. We're trespassers.
We are lawbreakers.

16:05.328 --> 16:07.163
Yeah, but our broken law is less
bad than the robbers' broken law

16:07.198 --> 16:08.692
- so we're good.
- Can we just talk about this?

16:08.727 --> 16:11.002
Jimmy! No! Jimmy! Jimmy!
No, no, no.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.437
911.
What's your emergency?
-

16:12.472 --> 16:15.006
-  Is this
an emergency?

16:15.041 --> 16:16.708
-  Hello?
Is anyone there?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.209
- Jimmy, absolutely not!
-  I--I can hear
you. Is someone hurt?

16:18.244 --> 16:20.440
-  I'm sending
help over--

16:29.748 --> 16:32.650
S...so why did you guys dress up
for Christmas?

16:33.389 --> 16:34.689
- Well, we're concerned
citizens--
- Well, it's actually not what--

16:34.724 --> 16:36.057
- ...and we wanted to
check out--
- ...it looks like at all.

16:36.092 --> 16:36.824
- ...and we had a seance.
- It was her idea
to come over here.

16:36.859 --> 16:39.257
My idea?
- Enough.

16:39.292 --> 16:41.461
We're gonna have to
separate you two for
the rest of the interview.

16:42.464 --> 16:45.003
Also, please wash
your faces before we continue.

16:47.799 --> 16:51.075
Tell me what happened on
the night of December 25th.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.538
- Okay.

16:53.343 --> 16:57.147
Wait, so, what time does
night start?

16:57.644 --> 16:59.611
I can't believe
I gotta babysit.

17:02.385 --> 17:05.221
But, I do get to meet a robber
my first day of the job.

17:05.256 --> 17:07.784
Starting off pretty good.
Starting off pretty cool.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.259
I told you.
We didn't rob this place.

17:10.294 --> 17:12.261
- Okay.
- We--we snuck in.

17:12.296 --> 17:16.826
We fell asleep. We woke up,
and we realized it was robbed.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.597
Like, technically,
we helped you guys out.

17:18.764 --> 17:20.731
Okay. All right. Just forget
the part where I said

17:21.107 --> 17:23.536
it was like my first day
on the job. Okay?
I'm not that dumb. All right?

17:23.571 --> 17:25.373
I did train for this.

17:25.408 --> 17:27.144
And then the whole thing flew
in my face.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.541
- Oh, my God.
- So they were the ones

17:28.576 --> 17:30.378
- who originally dropped
the turkey.
- Mm-hm.

17:30.413 --> 17:33.150
So, you see, it's not my fault
Christmas dinner got ruined.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.515
Yeah. Well,
in this situation, if anything,

17:35.550 --> 17:37.055
you're the Christmas hero.

17:37.321 --> 17:39.288
- I know!
-

17:39.323 --> 17:40.586
- Thank you!
- Man!

17:41.160 --> 17:42.687
Why did you enter
the Becker's house?

17:43.195 --> 17:46.460
I know the Beckers.
My family's cabin is next door.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.332
Really? Next door? Interesting.

17:50.565 --> 17:54.171
We thought they would appreciate
us keeping an eye on things.

17:54.338 --> 18:01.343
We needed to investigate
and confirm if the house
was haunted.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.841
Okay. Um...

18:05.382 --> 18:07.745
What happened after you entered
the premises?

18:08.220 --> 18:12.585
We made sure the premises
were secured, and they were.

18:12.620 --> 18:16.325
Didn't see anything too crazy
at the time.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.459
We assessed the haunted lights

18:18.494 --> 18:21.726
which were also securely
shut down.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.598
And look, I know the Beckers
wouldn't mind us hanging out.

18:25.633 --> 18:30.438
So, so, yeah. We played a board
game. Just lit a few candles.

18:30.473 --> 18:33.210
And then we had a seance.

18:33.641 --> 18:36.312
But we didn't do any
of this other stuff.

18:37.579 --> 18:40.712
Did I hear--did I hear you guys,
you said you did a seance?

18:41.385 --> 18:43.253
- Oh, yeah?

18:43.519 --> 18:44.848
So did you, uh...

18:47.787 --> 18:48.885
talk to any ghosts?

18:50.188 --> 18:53.263
Dude. There was
a spiritual presence
in the house last night.

18:53.793 --> 18:57.135
I f--I felt it when I walked in.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.764
But you did not vandalize
anything in the house?

18:59.799 --> 19:00.798
Absolutely not.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.670
Well, so, there was
a Hodag statue. But--

19:04.705 --> 19:05.803
We fixed it.

19:06.806 --> 19:08.806
Well if you didn't rob the house
then who did?

19:09.941 --> 19:11.677
I honestly do not know.

19:13.351 --> 19:16.286
Your boyfriend said that
a Hodag robbed the house.

19:16.651 --> 19:18.486
He said what?

19:34.702 --> 19:37.373
We're still trying to
get in touch with
the Beckers to confirm

19:37.408 --> 19:39.243
your relationship to them.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.344
While I continue
my investigation, I--

19:41.379 --> 19:44.314
Whoa. Uh. Our investigation.

19:47.583 --> 19:51.552
We have agreed to release them
into your custody

19:51.587 --> 19:53.785
so long as you agree
not to leave the county.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.556
Under any circumstances.

19:55.591 --> 19:57.294
Not leave the county?
I'm sorry, you know,

19:57.329 --> 19:58.856
we have to be in Chicago
tomorrow for work.

19:59.463 --> 20:02.959
Oh, well, I mean that kinda
sounds like a circumstance.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.202
Or, no.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.370
Or we can hold them.

20:08.307 --> 20:09.339
Hold them?

20:10.442 --> 20:12.408
In jail? What? We're supposed
to leave them in jail?

20:12.707 --> 20:13.940
- Well...
- Yeah, that's kinda
how it works.

20:13.975 --> 20:17.710
Babe, what about your brother,
Andy? Maybe he can take them.

20:17.745 --> 20:19.679
Guys,
I can't stay here.

20:19.714 --> 20:21.417
I'm gonna miss Jennifer's
New Year's party.

20:21.452 --> 20:23.617
Oh, I'm sorry. You're gonna miss
Jennifer's New Year's party?

20:23.850 --> 20:25.586
Where is
my responsible daughter?

20:25.621 --> 20:26.720
I am responsible,
Mom!
-- What are we doing here?

20:26.756 --> 20:28.188
- You just never see that.
- No. The police are here.

20:28.224 --> 20:30.789
We're doing this
because I responsibly
reported a robbery.

20:30.824 --> 20:32.591
No. You stayed
in a place you should
not have stayed.

20:32.626 --> 20:33.925
Why are so you mean to
me? Also, I stay in a place--
-  Are you kidding me?

20:33.961 --> 20:34.960
I don't get to see
my friends--
-  Do not try

20:34.995 --> 20:37.368
to out-scream me.
You know what, you go to college

20:37.403 --> 20:38.736
- and have a social life.
- I would love to go to college

20:38.771 --> 20:40.733
- if you would approve my essay.
- Every action
has a consequence.

20:40.768 --> 20:42.031
Say something.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.736
-I'd just like--
-Don't.

21:30.950 --> 21:33.819
First up, my house rules.

21:35.724 --> 21:39.792
You will forfeit both
your cell phones.

21:40.663 --> 21:42.630
You'll sleep in separate
bedrooms.

21:43.567 --> 21:45.996
You'll get up at six AM
every morning

21:46.031 --> 21:48.768
and make your beds and--
what now?

21:52.972 --> 21:54.939
Son of a--

21:54.974 --> 22:00.318
-

22:06.689 --> 22:08.557
Your uncle Andy told me
what happened to his house.

22:08.592 --> 22:10.359
I know you're telling
the truth about the Beckers.

22:10.394 --> 22:12.990
But I'm worried you don't
realize that your actions
have consequences.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.400
You need to take more
responsibility on and
help around the cabin.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.962
So I'm gonna send you a list
of chores to--

22:17.997 --> 22:21.339
Looks like they didn't
get everything.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.737
Not the time.

22:26.874 --> 22:28.874
I--I don't know if
this job is right for you.

22:30.009 --> 22:33.681
Well, we're gonna stay
at the family house.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.551
Hop in.

22:55.771 --> 22:58.442
I'm beginning to think that
maybe you two

22:58.477 --> 23:00.136
didn't rob the Becker's house.

23:16.121 --> 23:18.594
Oh. Thank you.

23:33.138 --> 23:35.710
Okay. I cannot believe that
there are robbers out there

23:35.877 --> 23:38.482
screwing people over and then
letting us take the fall for it.

23:38.748 --> 23:41.551
Yeah. These are the most
inconsiderate robbers ever.

23:41.751 --> 23:42.948
Okay. You know what?

23:44.151 --> 23:46.523
We need to find these assholes
and then clear our names.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.495
Well, what else
are we supposed to do?

23:52.190 --> 23:54.091
It's practically the Wild West
up here.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.566
We should scour the town
for clues.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.128
Stake out the empty houses.

23:58.504 --> 23:59.833
You will do no such thing.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.672
- Why not?
- Because you are not
Sherlock Holmes

24:03.707 --> 24:04.739
and this is real life.

24:05.071 --> 24:06.807
But the police think
that we did it.

24:06.842 --> 24:09.205
You are more likely to end up
getting hurt than you are

24:09.240 --> 24:10.679
to catch any robbers.

24:15.081 --> 24:18.555
I'm sorry. I cannot eat this
box macaroni and cheese.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.854
If we're going to be here
for a while,

24:20.889 --> 24:22.658
I'm going to get us some
real food.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.191
Do not go anywhere while
I'm gone.

24:28.226 --> 24:30.699
Remember, your very presence in
this house is enough

24:30.734 --> 24:31.931
to deter a robber.

24:54.725 --> 24:56.923
-

25:19.783 --> 25:21.618
I know your mom is
being hard on you, but

25:23.388 --> 25:24.654
- that's only because we know
how much untapped potential--
-

25:26.057 --> 25:27.323
Honey, life
after high school is hard.

25:27.358 --> 25:30.286
Figuring what you want to do
with your life is hard.

25:30.321 --> 25:33.531
- But you need a plan.
Make a goal chart and--
-

25:33.863 --> 25:35.863
Hey, sis.
How's your goal chart?

25:35.898 --> 25:37.964
-

25:51.309 --> 25:52.583
That was nothing, right?

25:53.552 --> 25:56.048
Yeah. Yeah, that was probably
the heater.

25:56.919 --> 25:59.315
So we don't have to
check it out.

26:01.055 --> 26:02.318
We should definitely
check it out.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.792
Shit!

26:20.239 --> 26:22.074
Okay, I know Andy said
not to do anything,

26:22.109 --> 26:24.912
but I don't think we can just
stay here and do nothing.

26:24.947 --> 26:26.309
- Yeah.
-

26:26.344 --> 26:27.882
I'm not going to
be able to sleep tonight.

26:28.984 --> 26:31.721
You know what?
We could put a lock
on the back door.

26:32.856 --> 26:34.988
- Yeah. Let's do that.
-

26:39.731 --> 26:42.963
Okay. Do you think we should put
some extra lights on timers?

26:42.998 --> 26:44.866
Yeah! Ooh, let's put the tree
on a timer.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.214
-

27:05.416 --> 27:08.153
- Madison, I found these great
party pop--
-

27:18.000 --> 27:19.362
Too long.

27:20.134 --> 27:21.265
That...

27:22.774 --> 27:23.773
That works.

27:34.181 --> 27:35.653
Okay.

27:38.856 --> 27:40.416
Close it. Close it. Close it.

27:42.024 --> 27:43.023
Okay!

27:48.327 --> 27:49.326
What?

27:56.940 --> 27:58.775
Do you even know how to use
that thing?

27:58.810 --> 28:02.174
Nope. But if I could figure it
out, I think it could be useful.

28:02.209 --> 28:03.307
Uh-huh.

28:11.383 --> 28:13.020
What the heck is this?

28:14.056 --> 28:15.418
Okay.

28:16.454 --> 28:17.827
What the--?

28:19.490 --> 28:22.458
- Absolutely not.
- What?

28:25.067 --> 28:26.737
And definitely none of that.

28:28.070 --> 28:29.234
And, actually,
I don't care about that.

28:29.973 --> 28:31.071
Oh, really?

28:31.106 --> 28:32.875
Well, I was 18 once too,
you know.

28:33.372 --> 28:35.944
But I do not drink and
play with knives.

28:35.979 --> 28:37.176
We're just trying to
protect ourselves.

28:37.211 --> 28:39.442
Or at least make some sort of
alarm system.

28:39.477 --> 28:42.082
Well, this is more likely to
harm you than any intruder.

28:44.482 --> 28:46.383
All right.

28:47.518 --> 28:49.826
You want to protect yourselves
like responsible adults?

28:49.861 --> 28:50.860
- Yes!
- Yes!

28:55.196 --> 28:56.998
What the?

28:58.969 --> 29:00.100
How long has that been there?

29:00.498 --> 29:02.201
- A while.
-

29:07.274 --> 29:08.372
Madison.

29:11.850 --> 29:12.882
Here you go, Jimmy.

29:16.151 --> 29:17.414
Hold it like Madison.

29:19.187 --> 29:20.186
All right.

29:20.353 --> 29:22.056
You have to chamber a round.

29:23.290 --> 29:25.422
Otherwise you'll look
like a fool with no intent.

29:27.162 --> 29:28.194
Oh, so just like--

29:29.901 --> 29:31.164
For Pete's sake!

29:32.367 --> 29:34.299
No! No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

29:40.406 --> 29:41.504
Thank you.

29:46.412 --> 29:48.951
These are BB guns.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.052
Take it.

29:52.622 --> 29:55.056
You'll be able to scare
people off, but you won't really
be able to hurt anyone.

29:56.191 --> 29:57.993
-  Oh, shit!

29:58.028 --> 29:59.060
Jesus Christ.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.163
Just--just take it from him.

30:06.036 --> 30:07.068
Ah.

30:10.601 --> 30:12.843
Here are some items you can
actually use.

30:17.443 --> 30:18.442
A pocket knife?

30:19.445 --> 30:21.280
In the right hands
a pocket knife can provide

30:21.315 --> 30:23.920
a person shelter, food,
and security.

30:23.955 --> 30:26.186
Making it an important asset
to mankind.

30:26.221 --> 30:28.353
Aw. It has such a small blade.

30:29.587 --> 30:31.026
That one has a flashlight.

30:37.199 --> 30:38.935
Okay. So now, we keep watch.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.300
And hope what we fear
will never come.

32:52.631 --> 32:57.271
- All quiet on the east side.
- All clear on the lake side.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.507
Have there been serial robberies
like this in the past?

33:03.114 --> 33:04.476
Luckily, no.

33:05.512 --> 33:08.051
Well, why do you think they're
breaking in

33:08.086 --> 33:09.481
and robbing people now?

33:09.747 --> 33:12.220
Hard to say.
It's different for each robber.

33:12.255 --> 33:14.519
I think these robberies are
crimes of opportunity.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.292
Do you guys want to watch
Santa Clause Conquers
the Martians ?

33:18.459 --> 33:19.755
Ooh.
- Santa did what?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.757
It's a really good movie. And!

33:23.068 --> 33:25.134
We can play a really fun
drinking game while we watch it.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.500
- We should keep a lookout.
-  Why?

33:29.272 --> 33:30.700
I mean, the sun is setting.
We're not going to be able

33:31.076 --> 33:32.504
to see much in the dark
anyway.

33:32.539 --> 33:35.474
Can we just take
a short break? Please?

33:35.509 --> 33:39.181
Wouldn't a movie playing deter
people from breaking in?

33:39.348 --> 33:40.644
Or we could play a game!

33:41.515 --> 33:42.581
What game?

33:42.616 --> 33:44.714
Why don't you teach us a game
that you like to play?

33:45.321 --> 33:47.255
Ooh, you show you yours,
I'll show me mine.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.412
Kings are worth four points.

34:12.447 --> 34:15.811
Queens three. Jacks two.
Aces are worth eleven.

34:15.846 --> 34:17.384
And then tens are worth ten.

34:17.419 --> 34:19.353
Okay. And nines are nine?

34:19.388 --> 34:21.157
- Uh, no. Zero.
- What about eights?

34:21.192 --> 34:22.191
Uh, zero.

34:22.391 --> 34:23.390
Seven?

34:24.626 --> 34:26.723
Zero. And, no, you don't play
with any cards under seven.

34:27.528 --> 34:28.824
O--okay.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.199
You'll figure it out.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.731
- When do you drink?
- Whenever you damn well please.

34:44.743 --> 34:47.843
What if the number of points
you score

34:47.878 --> 34:51.220
is the number of seconds
the person to your left
has to drink?

34:51.354 --> 34:53.519
Why must everything turn into
a drinking game?

34:53.554 --> 34:56.357
Now, can we just drink and
play a game?

34:56.392 --> 34:58.194
Let's just play something else!

35:12.309 --> 35:16.212
So, whatever the value
of the card that is in your set

35:16.247 --> 35:18.346
that's the number of seconds
you have to drink.

35:18.645 --> 35:20.579
What are these cards
in the middle here?

35:20.614 --> 35:23.384
Oh, no. It's way easier
to understand
the command cards first.

35:23.551 --> 35:25.749
So if someone flips over an ace,

35:25.784 --> 35:28.323
the person across from them has
to pound the table and shout

35:28.688 --> 35:32.393
"Two for all." If they don't,
they have to finish their beer.

35:33.363 --> 35:34.659
I'm not playing this game.

35:48.939 --> 35:50.378
Look at their helmets.

35:50.413 --> 35:51.907
Look at his beard.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.258
How long is this movie?

36:02.293 --> 36:04.194
It's 81 glorious minutes.

36:08.431 --> 36:09.562
- He said Santa!
- Drink!

36:21.576 --> 36:23.807
...supposedly frozen
individual moves!

36:23.842 --> 36:25.545
- It's rule number nine.
-

36:25.580 --> 36:29.252
Okay. Andy won.
Wake up. Uncle Andy won.

36:29.584 --> 36:32.585
Every time a Martian gets
attacked by a toy, you drink!

36:36.327 --> 36:38.327
Madison!
-  Straight line.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.955
I forgot to pack my toothbrush.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.958
Okay. That's a lot of
information. Just keep going.

36:42.993 --> 36:45.565
- I can do it myself!
- No, Jimmy! Be careful! Just--

36:45.732 --> 36:46.831
Oh, don't forget--

36:46.867 --> 36:48.370
-  Shit!
-

36:48.405 --> 36:50.207
Yeah. That.

36:50.341 --> 36:51.670
I'm okay!

37:02.419 --> 37:03.484
-

37:21.603 --> 37:24.901
Hey, kiddo.
I thought you went to bed.

37:27.609 --> 37:30.544
I, uh, haven't heard you play
in a while.

37:31.778 --> 37:33.283
Forgot how much I missed it.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.516
Thanks.

37:39.852 --> 37:41.753
So how's our young Jimmy?

37:42.459 --> 37:44.624
Alive. For now.

37:51.402 --> 37:52.500
What's on your mind?

37:56.033 --> 37:59.540
Maybe my mom was right.

38:00.642 --> 38:01.541
Probably.

38:01.577 --> 38:04.479
She thinks Jimmy's too immature
for me.

38:06.648 --> 38:07.746
What do you think?

38:08.045 --> 38:10.584
- I asked you first.
- You did?

38:10.949 --> 38:13.323
Well, do you think that Jimmy's
too immature?

38:14.953 --> 38:18.493
I do not think that Jimmy is
too immature for someone who

38:18.528 --> 38:21.562
does not go to school and
does not have a job.

38:22.763 --> 38:24.532
I knew it. My mom was wrong.

38:24.897 --> 38:26.402
- Huh.
-

38:26.635 --> 38:29.702
Come on! Remind me why
you're with him again?

38:31.035 --> 38:34.443
- He's funny.
- Yeah, he's amusing sometimes.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.908
- But he doesn't realize it.
- Okay. But that

38:38.108 --> 38:43.320
is probably because he does not
care what other people think.

38:43.817 --> 38:45.685
Yes, and that was cute
when he was 10.

38:50.857 --> 38:53.022
You know, a first love
is complicated.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.827
Especially with someone
you grew up with.

39:04.607 --> 39:05.738
Phone's dead.

39:07.445 --> 39:08.444
You'll be fine.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.348
I've lived my whole life without
a cell phone.

39:11.977 --> 39:14.846
- And I've somehow survived
without it.
- Hm.

39:17.818 --> 39:18.817
You know who made that?

39:19.754 --> 39:21.490
Yeah, my dad.

39:23.725 --> 39:24.757
You remember him?

39:27.091 --> 39:28.365
Yeah.

39:30.567 --> 39:36.505
I mean, they're faint memories,
but they exist.

39:40.907 --> 39:42.742
Yeah. Sure.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.817
Guess that's your cue
to go up to bed.

39:53.018 --> 39:55.018
I'll take the first watch
down here.

39:55.691 --> 39:59.055
And I will take the first shift
watching Jimmy.

39:59.761 --> 40:00.892
Good.

40:04.029 --> 40:06.700
Oh, uh, Uncle Andy?

40:07.934 --> 40:10.902
Thanks again. For everything.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.543
Anytime.

40:56.983 --> 40:59.456
Do you think that one
looks like an empty summer home?

41:01.823 --> 41:03.724
Fuck, is that light
always on?

41:04.562 --> 41:06.727
Mm. I don't remember.

41:08.225 --> 41:09.730
What about that one?

41:11.536 --> 41:13.701
Yeah, I think they live
in Chicago.

41:15.133 --> 41:16.231
All right.

42:50.096 --> 42:51.634
Shit!
- Just stay there.

42:51.669 --> 42:52.767
We thought no one was in
the house.

43:09.654 --> 43:11.819
Get back over here.
Get over here!

43:13.724 --> 43:14.987
Sit down, old man!

43:15.726 --> 43:17.319
How many other people
are in the house?

43:18.960 --> 43:20.058
Just me.

43:24.163 --> 43:25.800
So, what now?

43:47.758 --> 43:49.758
Shhhh, shhhhh.

43:50.156 --> 43:52.123
Okay, how drunk are you?

43:53.159 --> 43:54.559
- Mm.
-  Okay.

43:54.594 --> 43:56.798
I'm going to take my hand
off your mouth,
but you have to be quiet.

43:57.262 --> 43:58.800
- We're being robbed.
- What?

43:58.835 --> 43:59.834
Jimmy!

44:02.036 --> 44:04.773
Okay. I need your phone.
I'm gonna call 911.

44:08.075 --> 44:09.778
And your phone is dead.

44:10.143 --> 44:13.177
Yeah. It's my bedtime story.
It helps me sleep.

44:14.180 --> 44:16.345
Okay. Um, I'll just drive
to the police station.

44:16.721 --> 44:18.215
- I got our coats. Come on.
- Okay.

44:20.791 --> 44:22.659
Hands! Hands!

44:27.930 --> 44:29.127
All right.

44:34.805 --> 44:36.805
Ooh, why don't we try
this sheepshank one?

44:37.071 --> 44:38.741
- Huh?
-  The sheepshank.

44:39.403 --> 44:41.304
I know how to tie
a fucking knot!

44:44.177 --> 44:45.209
Okay.

44:50.447 --> 44:51.688
Madison!

45:03.229 --> 45:05.702
- Okay! Jimmy, toss me the keys.
-

45:08.003 --> 45:10.069
Are you serious? Okay.

45:11.468 --> 45:12.467
All right.

45:14.207 --> 45:15.371
- Jimmy.
-

45:15.505 --> 45:17.109
These are not Andy's keys.

45:18.981 --> 45:21.344
Fuck! They're not?

45:21.379 --> 45:23.852
In what world do you think
that these are Andy's keys?

45:24.118 --> 45:27.350
I'm sorry.
Can we still use them?

45:27.385 --> 45:29.154
No. we cannot still use--

45:31.994 --> 45:32.993
What?

45:38.528 --> 45:40.330
I don't--I don't understand.

45:40.365 --> 45:42.200
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

45:42.235 --> 45:46.006
Oh, shit. It's a stick. Umm.
Do you know how to drive stick?

45:47.009 --> 45:48.844
No. Do you?

45:49.407 --> 45:50.473
No, of course not.

45:50.508 --> 45:52.309
Why else would I ask you if
I knew how to drive--

45:52.344 --> 45:53.410
- Holy shit!
-  Get out of my truck!

45:53.445 --> 45:56.181
- It's the fucking Hodags again!
- Okay, okay! Okay.

45:56.216 --> 45:57.479
Get the hell out
of my truck!

46:00.088 --> 46:02.121
You're really gonna
want to get out now!

46:04.424 --> 46:07.159
-  Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Fuck! Fuck!

46:09.295 --> 46:12.428
Get the fuck out of my
goddamned truck.

46:15.037 --> 46:16.168
Now.

46:23.914 --> 46:26.013
All right. Give me your
cell phone.

46:26.048 --> 46:27.114
They're dead.
You don't have to--

46:27.149 --> 46:28.917
- Even better.
Give it to me anyway.
- You too!

46:29.447 --> 46:31.887
- I don't have a cell phone.
- That's impossible.

46:33.451 --> 46:34.549
I really don't.

46:36.190 --> 46:37.189
He's telling the truth.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.158
What? I don't understand that.

46:39.193 --> 46:40.555
How can you just not have
a phone?

46:40.590 --> 46:43.525
Fuck. We don't have enough rope
to tie everyone up.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.199
Well, um, why don't we just tie
his shoelaces together?

46:47.333 --> 46:49.135
There's more rope in the garage.

46:50.204 --> 46:51.335
Okay.

46:54.307 --> 46:57.440
Just stay here. Watch them.
Nobody moves.

46:57.475 --> 46:58.540
Yeah. Okay.

46:59.444 --> 47:00.949
Nobody moves!

47:14.360 --> 47:16.932
You know, I actually have to say
I kind of appreciate

47:16.967 --> 47:19.264
how cooperative you guys are
being, 'cause, to be honest,

47:19.299 --> 47:22.872
this is my first time ever
having a hostage.

47:29.243 --> 47:30.407
So, um...

47:31.610 --> 47:34.246
have any of you guys ever
been robbed before or anything?

47:34.512 --> 47:36.886
- Well, this is the second time
I've been robbed.
-  Oh.

47:36.921 --> 47:39.218
But the first time I've ever
been held hostage.

47:39.484 --> 47:41.957
Oh cool, cool. That's cool.

47:44.489 --> 47:45.521
Umm...

47:47.932 --> 47:51.626
Wait a second. I feel like I've
seen you guys before somewhere.

47:51.661 --> 47:55.102
Oh, that's, uh, weird.

47:55.137 --> 47:58.974
Hey, listen, I--I just,
I'm gonna be honest, you know,

47:59.009 --> 48:01.977
since this is your first
hostage thing.

48:02.012 --> 48:05.607
So this rope that's tying my
legs together,

48:05.642 --> 48:06.982
it seems a little loose.

48:07.215 --> 48:09.413
- Really?
- Yeah, I um...

48:09.646 --> 48:11.921
I don't think he
did a great job with the knot.

48:12.088 --> 48:15.056
Hm. Yeah, the knot's no good.
You should've used
a square knot.

48:15.289 --> 48:16.519
Square knot?

48:16.554 --> 48:18.092
I can teach you.
-  Yeah?

48:19.293 --> 48:20.292
Okay!

48:21.966 --> 48:24.659
Now you take one end
in each hand.

48:24.694 --> 48:28.971
Okay.
-  And then you take
the right end

48:29.666 --> 48:31.171
and throw it over the left.

48:31.206 --> 48:32.469
Right over left.
-  Yeah.

48:33.439 --> 48:34.911
And then pull it under.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.013
And then take the left end
and cross it over the right

48:38.048 --> 48:39.179
and then pull that under.

48:40.248 --> 48:43.018
Yeah, that's great. Oh.
That's amazing. Good job!

48:43.053 --> 48:44.613
- Yeah.
And then you pull both ends.
-

48:45.055 --> 48:46.188
Pull both ends. Cool!

48:46.223 --> 48:49.222
It's really simple but it looks
really fancy! Aw, good!

48:49.455 --> 48:51.620
Hey baby,
I made a triangle knot!

48:51.655 --> 48:53.391
Square knot.
- A square knot!

48:53.624 --> 48:55.261
Where the fuck is the other kid?

48:55.428 --> 48:57.395
Oh, he was here
just a second ago!
- Fuck!

49:00.466 --> 49:01.465
Don't shoot!

49:05.537 --> 49:06.635
Get back over here!

49:07.838 --> 49:10.705
- What the fuck was that?
- It was just a party popper.

49:10.740 --> 49:13.246
- A party popper?
- It's a homemade alarm system.

49:13.413 --> 49:15.149
Yeah, we set them up all over
the house.

49:15.184 --> 49:17.019
Oh, that's actually
a really good idea.

49:17.054 --> 49:18.185
Oh, is it?

49:18.550 --> 49:21.617
So there's more of these? Jesus.

49:22.059 --> 49:24.422
Here, tie him up with that
fancy new knot you just learned.

49:25.623 --> 49:26.622
It's a square knot.

49:28.131 --> 49:31.099
Um, okay,
if you could just have a seat.

49:31.134 --> 49:33.299
Uh, sure. Right here?
Yeah, okay.

49:35.732 --> 49:37.633
-  Shit!

49:40.242 --> 49:41.736
-

49:44.774 --> 49:46.609
-

49:48.145 --> 49:51.350
-  Right over
left. Left over right.

49:51.385 --> 49:53.121
-  Goddamn it!

49:53.156 --> 49:55.618
Air horn?! Air horn?!

49:55.653 --> 49:57.191
I'm gonna kill that kid.

49:57.226 --> 49:58.390
That looks kinda good.

49:59.393 --> 50:00.997
I'm kinda proud of myself.

50:01.395 --> 50:03.725
- You little shit!
-

50:04.266 --> 50:05.661
Outside. Now!

50:07.236 --> 50:12.470
-

50:15.145 --> 50:18.146
Guys, those are the Hodags!

50:18.676 --> 50:21.380
- What Hodags?
-  You know Hodags
aren't real.

50:21.415 --> 50:23.811
No, I know
that Hodags aren't real.

50:23.846 --> 50:27.650
Those are the Hodag masks
that I saw at the Beckers'
last night.

50:28.389 --> 50:30.059
Yeah, Jimmy!

50:30.226 --> 50:33.524
I think we all kind of figured
they were the same robbers.

50:33.559 --> 50:39.596
Yeah. But now you know I didn't
make the Hodag thing up.

50:39.763 --> 50:42.500
- Oh, my God.
-  Yeah.

50:44.438 --> 50:46.438
- So what's our next move?

50:46.836 --> 50:48.242
We're going to cooperate.

50:48.277 --> 50:49.276
What?
-  What?!

50:49.312 --> 50:51.740
I just really feel like
we could fix it.

50:52.116 --> 50:53.643
It's such a tiny little
bullet hole.

50:53.678 --> 50:55.546
I'm not gonna patch tires
with duct tape

50:55.581 --> 50:57.185
like a fucking asshole!

50:58.488 --> 51:00.650
There's a tube of super glue in
that bin that might be of use.

51:02.291 --> 51:04.192
- Thank you!
- Yeah.

51:06.856 --> 51:09.131
- What?
- Just go outside.

51:15.205 --> 51:18.602
So we're just gonna sit here
and watch them rob our house?

51:19.341 --> 51:22.309
- They have a gun, Madison.
- We have a BB gun!

51:22.344 --> 51:26.181
We are going to cooperate so
the situation doesn't escalate.

51:36.721 --> 51:39.557
This isn't working. How are we
gonna get to New Orleans?

51:39.592 --> 51:41.328
New Orleans? You're worried
about New Orleans, baby?

51:41.363 --> 51:43.264
I'm worried about how we get out
of the fucking driveway!

51:43.299 --> 51:45.596
Can't we...can't we just
take their truck?

51:45.631 --> 51:48.368
And leave ours for the police
to find it? Come on.

51:50.372 --> 51:52.768
What is this?
What are you doing?

51:54.178 --> 51:55.870
I am going to make this worth
our time.

51:55.905 --> 51:57.113
What are you--

51:57.643 --> 51:59.181
What is--

52:15.793 --> 52:16.792
Not the canoe!

52:18.829 --> 52:19.861
Please?

52:20.402 --> 52:21.201
Huh?

52:22.272 --> 52:24.767
My dad, um, made that for me.
Just--

52:24.802 --> 52:27.143
it's not worth anything.
I swear.

52:36.220 --> 52:37.219
Thank you.

52:46.593 --> 52:50.694
Uh, could you leave
Santa Clause Conquers
the Martians ?

52:50.960 --> 52:52.795
Seriously?
- What?

52:53.435 --> 52:54.533
It's a really good movie.

52:56.702 --> 52:57.501
Doesn't sound that great.

52:57.967 --> 52:59.670
Oh, it's actually highly
entertaining.

52:59.705 --> 53:01.573
- Yeah. Okay.

53:02.312 --> 53:03.872
Yes.
-

53:04.578 --> 53:07.183
Super glue doesn't do shit!

53:07.845 --> 53:09.515
You--you could use
the spare tire.

53:09.550 --> 53:10.681
I only have one.

53:10.848 --> 53:12.452
But I also have one.

53:12.784 --> 53:15.422
I believe my car keys are on
the kitchen counter.

53:16.788 --> 53:19.624
Shit. Yeah. That'll work.

53:21.595 --> 53:23.727
Missed one. Give me this.

54:23.019 --> 54:24.920
Did you guys also want
some water?

54:25.527 --> 54:27.659
- Sure!
- That would be awesome.

54:32.435 --> 54:37.031
Okay. Oh! Uh, okay.
Here we go. And...

54:39.937 --> 54:43.037
Okay, all right, let's see.

54:46.515 --> 54:47.745
- Aw!
-  Some for you.

54:47.780 --> 54:48.911
Thank you!

54:48.946 --> 54:49.812
- Oh.
- Awesome.

54:50.453 --> 54:52.453
- Very much appreciated.
-  For you!

54:54.050 --> 54:56.325
Okay, yeah! That's good.

55:01.024 --> 55:02.958
Oh. Uh...

55:04.533 --> 55:05.532
That's not gonna work.

55:05.568 --> 55:08.799
- Um.
- You know what?
There--there's straws,

55:08.834 --> 55:10.966
uh, in the drawer
under the microwave.

55:15.577 --> 55:17.412
- Oh, my God, she's so nice!
- Mm-hm.

55:26.390 --> 55:27.818
Oh!
- Found 'em!

55:27.853 --> 55:30.920
- Aw, that is so sweet!
- Thank you!

55:30.955 --> 55:32.592
- Very kind of you.
-  And...

55:33.595 --> 55:36.596
There and perfect! There we go.

55:37.467 --> 55:38.829
That's good, so...

55:42.032 --> 55:45.374
Oh. I guess that's not
really much better.

55:45.805 --> 55:50.874
No. Perhaps if you move those
stools from the other room

55:51.481 --> 55:55.109
in front of us, it might be
a good height for the straws.

55:55.881 --> 55:59.487
That's a great idea! Yeah! Okay.

56:00.622 --> 56:02.490
- In here?
- Yeah.

56:02.954 --> 56:06.626
- That was a great idea.
I get it.

56:06.892 --> 56:08.529
- There you go.
-  Okay!

56:08.993 --> 56:10.366
That's great.

56:12.700 --> 56:14.865
Uh. Can you hold this for me?

56:17.903 --> 56:19.375
And then we'll do this guy.

56:20.477 --> 56:21.608
- Here.
- Nice!

56:21.643 --> 56:22.774
And uh...

56:23.040 --> 56:24.138
Thank you!

56:25.541 --> 56:28.945
- This guy, and then, oh yeah!
That's like, perfect.
-

56:28.980 --> 56:31.519
There ya go! Yeah!

56:32.115 --> 56:33.884
- I like your necklace.
- Mm?

56:33.919 --> 56:35.391
Oh, thank you!

56:35.624 --> 56:37.151
- Can I have it?
- What? Oh, uh.

56:37.186 --> 56:39.461
Well, Jimmy gave it to me.

56:39.496 --> 56:40.762
Oh, you can just give it to her.

56:40.798 --> 56:42.662
- I got it out of
a vending machine.
-

56:42.697 --> 56:44.664
- I'm sorry, you what?
- Oh, boy.

56:46.063 --> 56:47.161
What the hell is this?

56:47.196 --> 56:48.899
Well, they were thirsty. So I--

56:48.934 --> 56:50.164
What?

56:50.199 --> 56:51.803
Well, I didn't want to be rude!

56:53.675 --> 56:56.841
Any--any more rude.
You know?

56:57.481 --> 56:59.910
Baby, please.
We are almost out of here.

57:00.209 --> 57:03.144
Just grab some more pillow cases
and meet me in the garage.

57:09.053 --> 57:11.185
Hey, so. What was
the plan with the stools?

57:11.693 --> 57:12.956
- What?
-

57:14.292 --> 57:16.828
The stools? Didn't you have her
move them over here so we could

57:16.863 --> 57:18.027
do something with them?

57:18.062 --> 57:21.063
Listen to me,
we are going to cooperate.

57:21.263 --> 57:23.769
Okay, Uncle Andy.
Let me ask you this.

57:23.804 --> 57:25.067
What happens if that guy snaps?

57:27.709 --> 57:29.544
Do you have those pocket knives
I gave you?

57:29.942 --> 57:31.678
- Yeah!
- All right, now.

57:32.175 --> 57:33.911
Give me one just in case.

57:33.946 --> 57:35.077
- Yeah. It's in my back pocket.
- All right.

57:36.447 --> 57:37.849
Oh, you know what?
I'm kinda sitting on it.
Let me just--hang on.

57:39.589 --> 57:40.688
Whoa!
Jimmy, be careful!

57:41.052 --> 57:42.150
Jimmy, come back
this way!
-

57:43.252 --> 57:44.757
Oh, oh.
-

57:44.924 --> 57:46.220
Got it?
- Okay. Got it!

57:46.255 --> 57:47.595
Yeah, right there. Okay!

57:55.231 --> 57:56.538
Ow!

57:56.573 --> 58:00.036
Oh!

58:00.269 --> 58:02.203
Are you okay?
- Is it bad?

58:02.238 --> 58:04.678
- Oh, that's a lot of blood.
- Is it broken?

58:04.713 --> 58:07.076
The fuck happened?
- I got booby-trapped!

58:07.111 --> 58:08.242
You shouldn't have taken off
your mask!

58:08.277 --> 58:09.749
What?

58:09.784 --> 58:11.586
Now they know
who the fuck you are!

58:11.951 --> 58:13.852
Do you have any idea
how fucked we are?

58:13.887 --> 58:16.591
They
weren't--they're not gonna tell!

58:16.626 --> 58:18.725
- Oh, really?
- We won't. We promise.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.562
- They're not gonna tell!
- Stop!

58:20.597 --> 58:21.728
I can assure you we
will not.

58:21.763 --> 58:23.290
I'm actually terrible
with faces.

58:23.325 --> 58:25.028
- See, we're good!
- No!

58:25.932 --> 58:27.030
Now we need to--

58:28.297 --> 58:29.802
We need to talk in private.

58:38.043 --> 58:41.517
We need to get to the basement.

58:47.822 --> 58:49.756
Put that up to your nose.
Come on, keep your head back.

58:52.354 --> 58:54.662
- Where are we going?
- Just get in the truck.

58:59.196 --> 59:00.261
What are you doing?

59:02.672 --> 59:04.265
Just try not to get blood
everywhere.

59:10.273 --> 59:12.680
Come on. Okay. Get in.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.783
Wait, wait, wait,
wait! The BB gun!

59:16.818 --> 59:17.817
Where the hell is he going?

59:18.215 --> 59:19.687
I don't know!
Jimmy!

59:21.317 --> 59:23.185
Where the fuck did
you go?

59:23.759 --> 59:25.825
Do not make me look for you!

59:38.840 --> 59:41.940
Patrick, baby.
What are you doing?

59:42.679 --> 59:43.678
I'm getting rid of them.

59:44.307 --> 59:45.581
Where are the others?

59:46.784 --> 59:47.979
I don't know. They must be
hiding somewhere in the house.

59:49.719 --> 59:50.817
Wait!

59:50.852 --> 59:53.347
Um.
We can't get rid of him now.

59:53.855 --> 59:55.624
'Cause they'll never come out
if he's dead.

59:56.055 --> 59:59.320
Fuck. This situation
is so fucked!

59:59.355 --> 1:00:01.861
I'm sorry. Okay, I'll fix it!

1:00:02.765 --> 1:00:06.195
Hey kids, you can come out
because we have your dad.

1:00:06.230 --> 1:00:08.065
We have your fucking dad!

1:00:10.267 --> 1:00:12.201
How do you check for
a pulse again?

1:00:18.011 --> 1:00:20.143
He's just unconscious.

1:00:22.719 --> 1:00:23.982
Maybe they're upstairs.

1:00:30.287 --> 1:00:32.221
Okay, here's our chance.

1:00:32.256 --> 1:00:34.388
We'll get out and
we'll get Andy, okay?

1:00:37.294 --> 1:00:39.734
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me try.
-

1:00:39.769 --> 1:00:41.296
- Shit.
-

1:00:43.003 --> 1:00:44.970
Just stop. Okay. You're going to
make too much noise. Okay?

1:00:45.005 --> 1:00:46.169
The bedroom door
is probably open.

1:00:47.304 --> 1:00:48.402
-  Shit.

1:00:49.438 --> 1:00:50.844
Okay. Um...

1:00:51.143 --> 1:00:52.747
Fuck. Fuck.

1:00:54.949 --> 1:00:57.015
Look, is there
another way out of here?

1:00:57.050 --> 1:00:58.412
No, there's not another
way out of here.

1:00:59.052 --> 1:01:00.656
Well, then what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:05.793
We're gonna wait. Yeah.
That's it.

1:01:05.927 --> 1:01:06.926
We're just gonna wait.

1:01:08.362 --> 1:01:09.896
We're gonna wait and,
um, and the robbers are
gonna leave eventually.

1:01:09.931 --> 1:01:11.326
And--and Andy will wake up.

1:01:12.934 --> 1:01:15.132
Andy's definitely gonna
wake up. And, uh--

1:01:15.167 --> 1:01:17.871
- No. I've got an idea.
- What?

1:01:17.906 --> 1:01:19.466
I'm gonna shoot through
the ceiling as a distraction.

1:01:19.501 --> 1:01:21.171
- You're gonna run up the stairs
when they open the door--

1:01:21.206 --> 1:01:23.173
Jimmy! Jimmy! Just stop! Okay?
Just stop!

1:01:23.747 --> 1:01:28.013
I am so sick
of your stupid ideas
that always end up

1:01:28.048 --> 1:01:30.048
with you hurting yourself or
someone else getting hurt.

1:01:31.117 --> 1:01:34.789
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to
help us out of a deadly

1:01:34.824 --> 1:01:36.023
- situation where someone--
- Okay, look. You know what--

1:01:36.059 --> 1:01:36.991
- ...is trying to shoot us.
- ...would help? You know what

1:01:37.026 --> 1:01:39.288
would help?
Is if you acted like an adult

1:01:39.323 --> 1:01:41.191
for five fucking seconds.

1:01:41.930 --> 1:01:43.798
- I do act like an adult!
I have a job.
- Shhh!

1:01:43.833 --> 1:01:44.966
I have a job.

1:01:45.001 --> 1:01:47.461
I go to work. You just sit here
and write letters about

1:01:47.496 --> 1:01:49.738
- your fucking stupid goldfish!
-

1:01:49.773 --> 1:01:53.071
You have a job?
You deliver weed.
They pay you in edibles.

1:01:53.106 --> 1:01:55.172
Yeah. They do pay me in edibles.
Edibles that you happily eat.

1:01:55.207 --> 1:01:56.039
I don't need edibles
to be happy.

1:01:56.075 --> 1:01:57.207
What do you need to be
happy, Madison?

1:01:57.243 --> 1:01:59.176
Because all I'm trying to do
is fucking make you happy.

1:02:03.820 --> 1:02:05.248
I just want to make you happy.

1:02:07.384 --> 1:02:09.087
And apparently
I can't do that anymore

1:02:09.122 --> 1:02:10.990
no matter how hard I try. So.

1:02:36.413 --> 1:02:39.018
I had no idea I was making you
feel like this.

1:02:41.957 --> 1:02:42.956
Yeah.

1:02:46.357 --> 1:02:48.027
We're gonna need each other

1:02:49.932 --> 1:02:51.866
if we're gonna make it through
the rest of the night.

1:03:01.471 --> 1:03:02.811
So what now?

1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:05.308
Um...

1:03:07.411 --> 1:03:08.410
We wait.

1:03:11.547 --> 1:03:13.052
And hope that Andy wakes up.

1:05:20.181 --> 1:05:22.577
Hey, Patrick.
Can you come here, please?

1:05:28.189 --> 1:05:29.518
I think he's still alive.

1:05:32.358 --> 1:05:35.194
If you find the others,
just shoot them.

1:05:36.428 --> 1:05:37.427
Where are you going?

1:05:38.595 --> 1:05:39.935
To get rid of him.

1:05:48.605 --> 1:05:52.013
Uh. Okay. We--we have to
get out of here.

1:05:52.048 --> 1:05:54.048
We have to get out of here now.

1:05:55.348 --> 1:05:56.578
I think I can break this open.

1:05:56.613 --> 1:05:58.448
What the hell are you doing?
Jimmy? Ugh!

1:05:58.483 --> 1:06:00.087
- Shit!

1:06:00.353 --> 1:06:02.221
- Can't you--
-

1:06:05.226 --> 1:06:06.621
I know you're in there.

1:06:07.492 --> 1:06:08.590
They found the trap door.

1:06:37.093 --> 1:06:38.389
I'm coming in!

1:07:10.093 --> 1:07:11.290
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:07:11.688 --> 1:07:12.687
We should just wait it out.

1:07:14.163 --> 1:07:15.529
They'll never find us down here.

1:07:15.565 --> 1:07:17.659
And then we can figure out
how to open the door
when they're gone.

1:07:20.169 --> 1:07:21.168
This was your plan.

1:07:25.405 --> 1:07:26.437
I know.

1:07:27.673 --> 1:07:29.143
We have to help Andy, okay.
We can't just wait here anymore.

1:07:29.178 --> 1:07:30.408
Madison, Madison!

1:07:41.817 --> 1:07:43.190
Hello?

1:07:45.128 --> 1:07:46.127
Hello.

1:07:48.593 --> 1:07:50.065
My name's Madison.

1:07:52.267 --> 1:07:53.266
Okay.

1:07:54.533 --> 1:07:56.830
My boyfriend's name
is Jimmy,

1:07:56.865 --> 1:07:59.074
and my uncle's name
is Andy.

1:07:59.802 --> 1:08:02.572
He's your uncle? I--
I thought that was your dad.

1:08:03.212 --> 1:08:07.346
Oh. You know what? I could see
how that would be confusing.

1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:08.479
Yeah.

1:08:09.713 --> 1:08:10.745
So...

1:08:12.155 --> 1:08:14.551
Patrick.
Is he your boyfriend?

1:08:16.357 --> 1:08:17.554
Yeah.

1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:20.458
What was your name again?

1:08:21.890 --> 1:08:23.362
Christine.

1:08:27.269 --> 1:08:31.106
Christine, you don't...
have to do this.

1:08:32.208 --> 1:08:34.109
What other choice do I have?

1:08:38.379 --> 1:08:39.642
Well, what do you want?

1:08:40.612 --> 1:08:42.381
Well, I don't want to go
to jail.

1:08:43.351 --> 1:08:47.650
You won't. No, I promise,
we would all testify for you.

1:08:49.258 --> 1:08:52.820
We just have to stop Patrick
and help my uncle.

1:08:53.592 --> 1:08:55.790
He's--he's really angry.
You don't--

1:08:56.595 --> 1:08:58.397
You don't know what it's like
when he's angry.

1:08:58.663 --> 1:09:00.894
-

1:09:14.514 --> 1:09:16.382
Why are you with him?

1:09:19.948 --> 1:09:22.190
He takes care of me, I guess.

1:09:24.557 --> 1:09:26.359
Why are you with your boyfriend?

1:09:27.824 --> 1:09:28.823
He's fun.

1:09:29.694 --> 1:09:31.027
Oh. Okay.

1:09:33.665 --> 1:09:37.271
I bet it's really fun
to have somebody else
to boss around, huh?

1:09:38.835 --> 1:09:41.308
Oh Christine. Christine,
don't cry, okay!

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:43.277
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:09:43.444 --> 1:09:44.674
It's gonna be okay.

1:09:45.843 --> 1:09:48.546
- Okay.
-  We just
need to help my uncle.

1:09:55.423 --> 1:09:56.521
Okay.

1:10:05.433 --> 1:10:06.465
Where are you?

1:10:08.865 --> 1:10:12.207
Oh, yeah. Um,
we're under the bedroom door.

1:10:13.342 --> 1:10:14.341
What?

1:10:14.574 --> 1:10:15.606
How is that possible?

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:18.840
You know, just, just close
the bedroom door.

1:10:31.492 --> 1:10:32.887
Okay. It's closed.

1:10:36.299 --> 1:10:38.332
Has that been here
the whole time?

1:10:38.367 --> 1:10:40.301
Yeah. It's crazy, right?

1:10:40.336 --> 1:10:41.830
- Okay, Jimmy. You got this?
-  Yeah!

1:10:41.865 --> 1:10:43.469
I need the rifle.
- No!

1:10:43.504 --> 1:10:45.339
No, no! It's gonna be fine.
Okay? I'm not--

1:10:45.374 --> 1:10:46.670
I'm not gonna hurt Patrick.
Okay?

1:10:46.837 --> 1:10:48.507
I'm not gonna hurt him.
Just--

1:10:48.905 --> 1:10:51.004
Okay. Call 911. All right?

1:10:51.039 --> 1:10:52.610
Just tell them you need
an ambulance!

1:10:54.009 --> 1:10:56.251
-

1:11:09.398 --> 1:11:10.397
Stop!

1:11:13.633 --> 1:11:14.665
Where's Andy?

1:11:17.098 --> 1:11:18.405
He's in the canoe.

1:11:42.959 --> 1:11:43.958
Drop the axe.

1:11:45.731 --> 1:11:46.763
Why?

1:11:47.568 --> 1:11:48.567
'Cause it's over.

1:11:51.836 --> 1:11:52.934
Really?

1:11:52.969 --> 1:11:55.673
Yeah. Christine called the cops.

1:11:55.708 --> 1:11:58.038
Yeah. So you might as well
give up now, Patty-boy.

1:12:00.581 --> 1:12:01.811
Christine would never do that.

1:12:02.077 --> 1:12:04.385
Oh, well she did.

1:12:04.717 --> 1:12:07.751
In fact, you're gonna hear
a siren going any minute now.

1:12:13.957 --> 1:12:15.462
The police are still coming.

1:12:15.860 --> 1:12:19.367
She--she definitely called them
before she left.

1:12:22.031 --> 1:12:23.437
So what's the plan?

1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:26.099
We stand here until the police
never come?

1:12:26.134 --> 1:12:27.672
See who gets hypothermia first?

1:12:29.445 --> 1:12:30.543
I bet you'll be the first

1:12:30.578 --> 1:12:32.006
to lose feeling in your
little fingers.

1:12:32.910 --> 1:12:35.042
Well, if we get too cold,
we could just shoot you.

1:12:35.484 --> 1:12:36.846
Yeah,
we'll just shoot you.

1:12:37.585 --> 1:12:38.716
With your BB gun?

1:12:39.147 --> 1:12:42.082
How did you--?
But it looks so real!

1:12:42.623 --> 1:12:44.018
I could always shoot you
with your gun.

1:12:45.758 --> 1:12:46.757
Yeah.

1:12:49.025 --> 1:12:51.366
Don't come any closer. No!

1:12:51.731 --> 1:12:54.501
I will shoot you.
Do not come any closer.

1:12:57.836 --> 1:12:59.440
I don't believe
you have it in you.

1:13:02.709 --> 1:13:04.808
You see I've known people
like you my whole life.

1:13:04.975 --> 1:13:07.877
You never worked a day. You had
everything handed to you.

1:13:09.650 --> 1:13:10.748
No.

1:13:11.784 --> 1:13:12.981
- You're not gonna shoot me.
-

1:13:16.459 --> 1:13:18.118
Holy shit! I just shot him.

1:13:18.923 --> 1:13:20.527
Holy shit! You just shot him.

1:13:23.763 --> 1:13:25.059
Oh, my God,
I just killed someone.

1:13:25.567 --> 1:13:26.731
You did just kill someone.

1:13:28.900 --> 1:13:30.603
Um, Andy?

1:13:31.067 --> 1:13:33.507
Andy! Andy! Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1:13:33.542 --> 1:13:34.541
Are you okay?

1:13:35.071 --> 1:13:36.642
This guy is not okay.

1:13:36.677 --> 1:13:38.611
Are you okay?
You're, like, okay?

1:13:38.646 --> 1:13:39.645
Okay.

1:13:40.748 --> 1:13:41.878
Okay. Are you breathing?
You're breathing. All right.

1:13:41.913 --> 1:13:43.176
Quite the wound.

1:13:43.211 --> 1:13:44.344
Okay. It's going to be okay.

1:13:44.379 --> 1:13:47.048
I don't know what to do.
I need, like, a pressure thing.

1:13:51.219 --> 1:13:52.922
Oh, that was a noise!
That's good.

1:13:54.563 --> 1:13:57.795
- Woah! Jimmy! What the fuck!

1:13:57.962 --> 1:13:59.027
What are you doing?

1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:00.897
I gotta get rid of the body!

1:14:01.196 --> 1:14:03.570
What are you talking about?
What? Why?

1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:05.299
You always have to
get rid of the bodies.

1:14:07.708 --> 1:14:11.512
Okay. Now, we have to figure out
how to clean up all the blood.

1:14:11.547 --> 1:14:15.813
Jimmy, just--just--just stop.
Okay? Just--just
stop everything.

1:14:18.554 --> 1:14:19.652
Oh.

1:14:21.216 --> 1:14:22.985
I guess she did call the police.

1:14:48.551 --> 1:14:51.486
Could you just explain to me
one more time...

1:14:53.556 --> 1:14:55.688
what the bubble wrap was
supposed to do?

1:14:57.087 --> 1:14:58.592
I just--I don't...

1:15:02.092 --> 1:15:03.498
That's the part I don't get.

1:15:08.164 --> 1:15:11.572
We were able to make our case
that we acted in self-defense.

1:15:11.970 --> 1:15:15.972
Though, Jimmy's case was
a little more complicated.

1:15:20.044 --> 1:15:22.011
Christine never made it
to New Orleans.

1:15:22.717 --> 1:15:24.882
She was spotted by
state troopers and arrested

1:15:24.917 --> 1:15:26.587
before she even
got to Illinois.

1:15:31.319 --> 1:15:34.023
Our parents not only forgave
us for all of our stupidity

1:15:34.058 --> 1:15:35.090
but...

1:15:36.626 --> 1:15:39.028
they provided
invaluable support
that we gladly accepted

1:15:39.063 --> 1:15:41.767
for the first time
in a long time.

1:15:49.073 --> 1:15:50.908
My Uncle Andy made
a full recovery.

1:15:51.845 --> 1:15:53.812
Well, basically.

1:15:55.482 --> 1:15:58.212
Most nights I envy
his inability to remember
the robbery well.

1:16:04.319 --> 1:16:05.318
Hey.

1:16:06.695 --> 1:16:07.694
Hey.

1:16:19.972 --> 1:16:20.971
Well, and...

1:16:32.116 --> 1:16:34.655
It's incredible
how the worst of times

1:16:34.690 --> 1:16:36.118
can bring out
the best in people.

1:16:37.055 --> 1:16:39.352
I never expected that
the worst night of my life

1:16:39.387 --> 1:16:41.728
would help me discover
my best self.

1:16:42.126 --> 1:16:44.225
Though it was an unfortunate
chance that Patrick

1:16:44.260 --> 1:16:46.227
and Christine chose to rob
our house,

1:16:46.966 --> 1:16:49.263
we chose to take
certain actions to--

1:16:49.804 --> 1:16:50.803
Wait, we--

1:16:51.739 --> 1:16:52.838
"We chose to take
certain actions to--"

1:16:52.873 --> 1:16:55.742
That is super awkward. Uh...

1:16:59.748 --> 1:17:01.011
Oh. Okay.

1:17:01.046 --> 1:17:04.685
"It was our..."

1:17:07.085 --> 1:17:10.284
"It was our actions that got us
out of the house alive."

1:17:11.155 --> 1:17:12.154
Yeah.

1:17:13.457 --> 1:17:16.257
"I realize this is probably not
the answer you were expecting

1:17:16.292 --> 1:17:17.962
when you posed the question,

1:17:17.997 --> 1:17:20.767
'What is the biggest obstacle
that you have overcome?'

1:17:22.166 --> 1:17:25.266
But I assure you that
I bring a unique life experience

1:17:25.301 --> 1:17:27.675
and a proven ability to
work with...

1:17:29.877 --> 1:17:31.844
difficult people.

1:17:33.276 --> 1:17:35.650
I have persevered through
the darkest night,

1:17:36.279 --> 1:17:38.246
and I am prepared for
the challenges ahead."

1:17:50.095 --> 1:17:51.798
Madison!
