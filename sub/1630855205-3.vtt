00:09.510 --> 00:11.303
Baby, you made partner.

00:11.803 --> 00:15.265
They say you don't feel like a partner
until you've been to the retreat.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.350
I've never heard that before.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.019
Well, I just made it up, but I can
do that now because I'm a partner.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.855
The power emanating from you
is really turning me on.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.607
- Yeah, it's turning me on too.
- Yeah.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.859
Hey, why don't you get my lanyard?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.069
Your lanyard.

00:27.819 --> 00:28.820
Thank you.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.156
- There it is.
- Wow.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.910
Look at that. You got a QR code.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.704
I gotta scan that QR code
for the full schedule.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.331
I'm gonna scan your ass.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.710
Wow.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.466
Is this everything you ever dreamed of?

00:49.466 --> 00:52.970
Yes, but even blander, if that's possible.

00:52.970 --> 00:57.683
- Sylvia. Oh, my God.
- Hi. Hey, Stewart, nice to see you.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.394
I'm so glad you're here.
It's gonna be so much less boring.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.478
You're so sweet.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.438
Well, we're very excited
for our staycation,

01:03.438 --> 01:05.858
and me for my front-row seat
of the partners' orgy.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.485
- The orgy is supposed to be a secret.
- My bad.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.945
Cheese platter, hello.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.905
May I recommend
the florescent green cubes?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.073
They taste like nothing.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.368
Frank Schaeffer, his speeches are endless.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.913
I think he founded the firm so he can
hold us all hostage with his golf stories.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.915
Oh, my God. That guy.
I've met him a dozen times.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.625
He never remembers my name. Not once.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.835
Never remembers anybody's name.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.587
It's one of the perks of being successful.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.214
I cannot wait to be successful enough that
I don't have to remember the names.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.425
Hey, hey, hey.
Welcome to the show, newbie.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.011
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey, newbie.

01:34.011 --> 01:38.473
Congratulations, partner.
That was a cowboy accent.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.100
And a fine one at that.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.476
Sylvia, you're from Australia.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.187
What do you know about cowboys?

01:43.187 --> 01:45.731
Hey, did you guys hear
that Milton got taken off Dupont?

01:45.731 --> 01:46.648
What?

01:46.648 --> 01:49.359
Wait, Milton was running point
on everything to do with Suarez.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.445
- He was.
- Not anymore.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.697
Sorry, we're gonna have to
take this from the top.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.283
Who's in charge?
I've done a ton of work on Dupont.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.243
Okay, it was a mandatory withdrawal,
first of all.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.287
- But then trail-- Yes.
- Mandatory withdrawal?

02:00.287 --> 02:03.290
- Hi, I'm Marjorie, Albert's wife.
- Hi.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.584
Greg, Dan's husband.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.044
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.961
Sylvia. I'm Charlie's wife.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.054
It's a disaster.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.014
- It's the event trial right now.
- Relax.

02:19.014 --> 02:22.935
- Gentlemen, playing through.
- Hey, Frank. How's the speech coming?

02:22.935 --> 02:24.645
- How's it coming?
- Slow.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.605
We're gonna have to skip
all the afternoon sessions

02:26.605 --> 02:28.565
to finish the damn thing. But who cares?

02:28.565 --> 02:31.109
It's a bunch of lawyers just waiting
to get to the bar. Am I right?

02:31.860 --> 02:32.986
I'm sorry.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.863
It's okay. It's probably for the best.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.365
Frank Schaeffer.

02:36.365 --> 02:39.284
Sylvia Grieves. Yeah.
We've actually met before a few times.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.703
Forgive me. I'm terrible with names.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.998
No, I'm just giving you a hard time.
Just kidding. Nice to see you.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.125
- Prosecco?
- Yes.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.128
Wait a minute.
Did you use to work at Mezzaluna?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.380
Three years ago.

02:51.380 --> 02:55.300
Wait. Kenneth from Ohio.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.927
Yes. Oh, my God.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.637
Am I right? Am I right?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.557
It's a gift. All right, let's drink.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.019
So I'm at my aunt's apartment
with my cousins,

03:47.019 --> 03:48.395
and my aunt's cooking dinner.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.480
My favorite kind of dinner.
Seven-layer dip.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.649
And guess who walks in?

03:54.318 --> 03:56.737
I don't think you're ever gonna guess,
'cause you don't know him.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.323
Then he's like, "Just because we
haven't seen each other since high school,

03:59.323 --> 04:00.908
doesn't mean we're not friends anymore."

04:00.908 --> 04:02.701
I'm like,
"Were we friends in high school?"

04:02.701 --> 04:05.120
Because he used to throw
chicken sandwiches at my head.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.581
And it was public school,
so the chicken was hard as fuck.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.502
So, we're at his place,
and his little brother is all like,

04:11.502 --> 04:12.586
"Don't touch my Xbox."

04:13.170 --> 04:15.714
And I'm like, "I don't even
play Xbox anymore, little man."

04:15.714 --> 04:18.175
You feel me?
Like, I put aside childish things.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.094
I play adult games like Settlers of Catan.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.721
- You ever played that?
- No.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.349
It's actually just called "Catan" now,
not "Settlers of Catan,"

04:25.349 --> 04:28.393
because of the implications of
settler colonialism.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.980
And the 7-Eleven was literally closed.
I didn't even know it could close.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.899
Isn't that supposed to be a 24-hour place?

04:33.899 --> 04:36.193
You know, like seven days a week.
Seven till 11?

04:36.193 --> 04:37.819
Fucking shit!

04:37.819 --> 04:39.947
Shit, man. That looked like it hurt.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.658
- It did.
- Anyway, where was I?

04:42.658 --> 04:45.369
Yeah, the seven is for seven days a week,
but the 11 is--

04:45.369 --> 04:48.288
It's 11, um...

04:48.288 --> 04:49.790
When it closes, man.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.707
11:00 p.m.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.334
- Yes.
- Damn.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.336
You know, I used to steal
from 7-Eleven all the time,

04:54.336 --> 04:56.255
but I didn't have to, I had the money.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.507
You know,
I'm like a normal blue-collar guy.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.467
You know, I like spicy stuff
as much as the next guy.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.136
But have you ever
had Doritos for the damned?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.388
Fuck.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.890
You know you have to
sterilize that now, right?

05:06.890 --> 05:07.975
I know.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.980
Man, we work in a bar. How dope is that?

05:14.606 --> 05:15.858
It's pretty dope, Omar.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.903
Yo, did you print out that W-4?

05:19.903 --> 05:21.947
No, actually the printer here is broken.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.699
Okay.
You ain't got a printer at your house?

05:23.699 --> 05:25.784
I don't.
My wife got the printer in the divorce,

05:25.784 --> 05:28.370
so thanks for bringing up
that very, very, very painful memory.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.038
- I really appreciate that.
- What up, boys?

05:30.038 --> 05:31.748
Hey, yo, I got something
to float by you guys.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.459
- A possible collab for us.
- A collab?

05:34.459 --> 05:36.295
What do you think of Johnny 66?

05:36.295 --> 05:38.672
Johnny 66--
That's the restaurant chain, right?

05:38.672 --> 05:42.009
- Yeah, it's like a fast-casual place.
- Yeah, it's super cheesy, terrible.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.886
I don't know, but there's a lot of them.

05:43.886 --> 05:47.139
Well, just 'cause there's a lot
of something, it does not mean it's good.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.307
That's a good lesson for you.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.559
There's a lot of serial killers.
Serial killers are not good.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.562
- Are there that many serial killers?
- I think there is a lot of serial killers.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.148
My grandma used to live next to
the Golden State killer.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.525
- There you go.
- That's crazy.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.485
They used to bring each other
banana bread and shit.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.487
There's more television shows
about serial killers

06:02.487 --> 06:03.822
than there's actually serial killers.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.574
I really hope that's true,
'cause if it's not,

06:05.574 --> 06:10.120
Ice-T alone has conservatively caught
25,000 serial killers just in New York.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.748
- That's a lot of serial killers.
- Guys, let me talk, guys.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.957
Please talk.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.586
I fucking met the CEO of Johnny 66,
and guess what?

06:17.586 --> 06:19.838
He's interested in licensing our beer.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.089
You're welcome.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.593
And he's coming in tonight to try it.
Let's fucking close this shit.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.346
I don't think that is, like,

06:27.346 --> 06:30.766
really what is representative
of who we are necessarily.

06:30.766 --> 06:31.934
Which is what again?

06:31.934 --> 06:36.605
Which is creating an incredibly
high-quality product using integrity,

06:36.605 --> 06:39.024
and then selling that product
to people on Hinge dates

06:39.024 --> 06:41.527
and, like, pretty well-to-do alcoholics.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.071
Well, I think Johnny 66
is a dope-ass idea.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.949
And if he likes our beer,
we make freaking bank, bro.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.367
We should do it.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.244
I'm sorry, I'm not interested.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.829
Well, overruled.
It's not really up to you, man.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.706
Well, it is up to me,
'cause I'm the brewmaster.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.376
Well, I'm the money master
and this is my bar. So--

06:57.376 --> 06:59.753
Money master is not a thing.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.214
And me and Andy
each own a quarter of this place.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.757
Yeah, no. Yeah, you're right.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.261
You each own 24.5%
which together equals f--

07:07.261 --> 07:08.554
Forty-nine.

07:08.554 --> 07:13.100
Thank you. Forty-nine percent.
A minority stake, you fucking idiot.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.602
I'm the one who works
their fucking ass off

07:15.602 --> 07:17.145
to make this place what it is.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.231
Yeah, you did that with my money, bro.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.692
And you did a great job, William. Congratulations.

07:21.692 --> 07:25.279
Look at all the attention we're getting.
And now we can make even more money.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.823
I mean, that's what life's about,
right, boys?

07:27.823 --> 07:29.449
I mean, think about it,
it's about progression,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.994
it's about moving up.
It's about generational wealth.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.412
When you're playing <i>Call of Duty</i>,

07:33.412 --> 07:35.289
do you sit on rookie level
the entire time?

07:35.289 --> 07:38.292
Absolutely fucking not.
You move up, you go to elite.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.501
And then after elite, you go

07:39.501 --> 07:43.881
where Johnny 66 with an association of
Lucky Penny Brewing is gonna go.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.215
You go to legendary.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.217
I don't know what the fuck
any of that means

07:47.217 --> 07:49.678
because I'm over 12 years old.

07:49.678 --> 07:53.265
Will you tell this
mustachioed little fucking twerp

07:53.265 --> 07:56.268
that I'm not collabing
with a fascist burger chain?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.563
You know what?
I gotta go to the back and clean up

07:59.563 --> 08:02.441
because it's a little messy
making you guys money

08:02.441 --> 08:04.318
while you stand here in your fucking vest.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.403
I didn't get your name. I'm Will.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.906
Those are fucking cool. Are those Balmain?

08:08.906 --> 08:11.074
- Yo, she's with me.
- Yeah, no fucking kidding.

08:12.075 --> 08:16.079
I don't know anything about you at all.
I guarantee you can do better.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.290
Will, wait.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.962
I spent the last four months
in Des Moines working on a case.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.758
I gotta say, Des Moines,
surprisingly robust gay scene.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.343
Most of them work at Applebee's.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.802
I love Applebee's.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.136
She loves Applebee's.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.181
Who doesn't love Applebee's?
I'm still in touch with Duane.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.559
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.812
This retreat's for partners.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.940
Vanessa, hey.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.609
Plus, I get Sylvia.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.570
Hi, Vanessa. My goodness.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.863
Look at the four of us.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.575
It's like a 20-year reunion
at Kaplan-Meyer summer associates.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.494
So, you made partner too.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.996
That's amazing. Congratulations.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.624
Thanks. Still not anywhere close
to the equity I deserve,

09:00.624 --> 09:03.252
but that is a lawsuit for another day.

09:03.252 --> 09:06.421
Wow, you are a trooper
for coming to this with Charlie.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.340
No, I'm not here to hang out with Charlie.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.134
I'm just here for the free hotel room
and a night away from the kids.

09:11.844 --> 09:12.845
I hear that.

09:13.846 --> 09:17.224
Speaking of which,
how are Frances, Simon, and Maeve?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.976
- Nailed it.
- Mommies always do.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.519
I know, Mommy power.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.814
That's it. Mommy power.
I forgot how funny you are.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.066
Mommy power.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.528
But they're good. Thank you for asking.
Yeah. Yeah, three's a lot.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.823
Yeah, well, color me terrified then,
'cause I just had my fourth.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.909
- What?
- Yep.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.327
But, did you--

09:37.327 --> 09:43.250
Anyway, I'm gonna go.
I will see you and you later, partners.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.670
And Mama, I want you to have a wonderful
day and take care of yourself, okay?

09:46.670 --> 09:47.796
You're the best.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.757
Vanessa,
can we put our heads together for a sec?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.676
Give me a second.
Mommy power. I've gotta--

10:18.202 --> 10:19.620
So, Vanessa made partner.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.708
- Yeah.
- Did I know that?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.546
I don't know. Did you?

10:29.546 --> 10:32.799
I don't think I did.
No, I definitely didn't.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.553
Why didn't you tell me?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.055
I don't know,
it didn't seem that important.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.389
Lots of people make partner.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.476
I guess it just slipped my mind.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.103
It slipped your mind?

10:46.730 --> 10:47.773
What do you want me to say?

10:47.773 --> 10:50.025
She works hard,
she's been at the firm for a long time.

10:50.025 --> 10:53.070
When you do those things,
at a certain point you make partner.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.321
Yeah, but Vanessa is different.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.698
We went to law school together,
we clerked together.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.283
And you know how I feel about her.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.411
It's like she represents
everything that I could have been.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.456
Babe, I hear you. I really do.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.417
But she's not living some magical life.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.128
You know, she probably envies you.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.798
She's probably saying things
to her husband about you.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.132
Like what?

11:15.717 --> 11:19.763
I don't know.
I'm not in their conversations.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.516
Maybe about you buying the house,
fixing it up,

11:22.516 --> 11:24.226
and being, you know, like, creative.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.602
You don't believe that.

11:25.602 --> 11:29.106
It sounds like a lot more fun than arguing
about a legal contract for five hours

11:29.106 --> 11:31.108
around a conference table
where you can't cross your legs

11:31.108 --> 11:32.943
because there are so many AV wires.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.115
You know what? I'm sorry, babe.
It's not a big deal, right.

11:38.115 --> 11:41.493
This weekend is about you,
and I'm so proud of you.

11:41.493 --> 11:45.289
I just want you to enjoy yourself
and enjoy the AV wires.

11:46.707 --> 11:47.791
Thank you.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.796
And you enjoy your afternoon.
And I'll see you at the reception tonight.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.631
- Okay. Love you.
- Love you.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.927
Did you hear Milton
got taken off of Dupont?

11:58.927 --> 12:00.262
Wait, what?

12:00.262 --> 12:03.682
- I thought the Suarez case was his thing.
- Used to be.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.226
- Wow.
- Paul with the printer.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.728
- Hey, hey.
- Yes!

12:07.728 --> 12:10.814
They told me there were plugs up here
so I figured I'd bring it up.

12:10.814 --> 12:11.940
Yeah, might as well.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.276
Problem solved!

12:14.276 --> 12:15.986
Did you bring a laptop cord?

12:15.986 --> 12:17.863
No. Where are my nachos? I ordered nachos.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.865
- How'd you order 'em?
- Fully loaded.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.116
That's what I thought.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.418
Sorry.

12:32.836 --> 12:33.837
Sorry.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.257
<i>All rise.</i>

12:38.675 --> 12:40.385
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

12:41.053 --> 12:44.264

12:51.104 --> 12:54.691
You can't just take me off Dupont,
I brought that case in.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.320
I'm not just some associate,
I'm a partner. I'm a partner!

13:11.500 --> 13:14.461
I don't see what the problem is.
My kids and I love Johnny 66.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.255
That does not make me feel better at all.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.923
Well,
it's not meant to make you feel better.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.133
- It's meant to make our kids feel better.
- Why did we meet here?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.593
This is the lamest part of downtown.

13:21.593 --> 13:25.305
You know, I was just really hungry.
And I also have this desire

13:25.305 --> 13:28.600
to be surrounded by classic cars
and old American nostalgia

13:28.600 --> 13:30.435
from when this country was a better place.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.564
I found a way to reconcile
those two desires. Look.

13:34.356 --> 13:37.401
No, not here.
No, no, no, no, I'm not going.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.611
No, there's so many better places
to eat around here.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.531
- Don't be a square. Come on. Come on.
- Come on, don't do that.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.783
I can't be seen
going into a place like this.

13:47.953 --> 13:49.371
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.456
Table for two, please.

13:51.456 --> 13:55.085
Well, your pit crew will have your
table ready in one minute and counting.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.171
All right, thank you.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.592
The fact that you like this place
is the most unknowable thing about you.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.010
I love this place.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.387
Now, why do we have Rosa Parks on the wall

14:05.387 --> 14:09.683
next to three girls drinking milkshakes,
above a car Adolf Hitler designed?

14:09.683 --> 14:11.727
It's your country. You explain it.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.271
Least she's at the front
of the restaurant.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.481
Who's this fucking guy?

14:17.191 --> 14:18.483
You know who that is?

14:18.483 --> 14:21.570
That's the founder and visionary
of Johnny 66.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.655
- It's Johnny Rev.
- That's not a real name.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.699
If it was, that would be truly miraculous.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.910
He is actually a very interesting guy.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.162
He's very smart.
I heard him interviewed on NPR.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.123
They consider him a disrupter.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.960
Look he's disrupting people's buttholes
after they eat his onion rings.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.670
Listen, you could learn from him.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.465
What? How to become a hybrid
of a human and a tanning bed?

14:41.465 --> 14:44.593
How to run a beloved
and successful business.

14:44.593 --> 14:48.096
Honestly, this place fucking sucks,
and I want nothing to do with it.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.390
That was cool.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.561
- Follow me.
- Thank you, I love your hair.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.147
- They make me do this.
- That's great.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.733
Merch.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.860
Do people actually buy this shit?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.487
Just have a little look.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.200
How many doo-wop songs are there?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.952
You know,
if you listen to the words carefully,

15:09.952 --> 15:12.996
every single one of them
is about having sex with an underage girl.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.498
It's a disgusting genre.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.875
I'm so bummed they didn't have
the mozzarella stick shifts.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.460
They're so good. You would've loved them.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.045
The beer is garbage.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.048
You should try a fender blender.
They're very strong.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.132
What's in there?

15:24.132 --> 15:26.134
Everything that's in a piña colada.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.513
- So it's a piña colada?
- No, it's a fender blender.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.139
- That's good branding.
- You want to get one?

15:31.139 --> 15:33.016
- I'm okay. Thank you.
- Come on.

15:34.268 --> 15:45.696
<i>Happy birthday
Happy, happy birthday</i>

15:45.696 --> 15:49.283
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

15:49.283 --> 15:52.870
- Vroom, vroom. Happy birthday, Daddy-o.
- Thank you.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.872
- Love you, baby doll!

15:54.872 --> 15:57.332
- Not my birthday.
- Thanks, guys. He's lying.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.792
- You proud of yourself?
- Happy birthday.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.837
You know my wish? That a meteorite
kills us all, right now.

16:05.799 --> 16:09.887
I'll give it to Johnny Rev, which I assume
is short for "Johnathan Revolution."

16:10.846 --> 16:13.390
These are delicious, and these booths
are very fun to sit in.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.642
- See?
- And the food is pretty fucking good.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.729
- Somebody changing their mind?
- No, not at all.

16:18.729 --> 16:20.105
I'm confused.

16:20.606 --> 16:24.318
Isn't the point of starting a brewery
just to sell a lot of beer?

16:24.318 --> 16:26.862
The point is to sell good beer,
which we are doing.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.697
And I'm very happy
with our level of success,

16:28.697 --> 16:30.199
and I have no interest in selling out to,

16:30.199 --> 16:32.034
like, a giant corporate conglomerate.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.785
That's a little bit illogical. Come on.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.496
Like, you're just gonna be
making beer and selling beer

16:36.496 --> 16:38.040
and probably make a lot of money.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.917
- And--
- Why is everyone so obsessed with money?

16:40.918 --> 16:45.631
Take it easy.
Back up, Alexandria Cortazio-Cortez.

16:45.631 --> 16:46.965
Not even almost her name.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.384
I don't think you got--
I think you got one out of three right.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.387
Okay. What's really going on?

16:56.725 --> 16:57.935
I'm gonna be honest with you.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.063
I am cool.

17:03.357 --> 17:04.733
I'm a cool.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.401
- I'm in the cool category.
- "A cool"?

17:06.401 --> 17:08.111
- I'm a cool guy.
- Singular?

17:08.111 --> 17:11.865
This place? Not fucking cool. It's uncool.

17:12.657 --> 17:16.244
And if you're like me, that is terrifying.
Okay?

17:16.244 --> 17:18.372
- You gotta stay cool. Gotta stay cool.
- I gotta stay cool.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.705
I can't not be cool.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.209
Nobody is saying that you're not cool.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.252
This place would be saying I'm not cool.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.505
Nobody's saying you're not cool.

17:26.505 --> 17:31.260
I'm just suggesting that maybe
at this point in our lives

17:31.260 --> 17:34.847
when we're at this age, that maybe
we should focus less on being cool

17:34.847 --> 17:37.349
and more on acting our age.

17:37.349 --> 17:41.311
Well, that was spoken
like a true lamazoid.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.480
I just can't be a corporate sellout.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.607
Well, you gotta go tell Andy.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.609
He went to business school.
I don't know what to say.

17:47.609 --> 17:50.320
I'm a lawyer. I'll come with you.
We'll sort it out.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.155
- I'll come with you.
- Thank you.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.078
You guys look fucking insane.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.039
Yeah, and I'll tell you why.
We were at Johnny 66.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.583
We had a great time.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.543
The cake was good,
and it came in a little car,

18:04.543 --> 18:06.295
but other than that
it fucking sucks there,

18:06.295 --> 18:08.589
and we cannot have this guy
coming here tonight,

18:08.589 --> 18:11.800
trying all of our delicious beers
and making us an offer we can't refuse.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.136
I think we should serve our beers
at Johnny 66.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.722
Yeah, I want to completely sell out
and make money.

18:17.306 --> 18:20.517
Are you kidding me, man?
Have you been inside of a Johnny 66?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.519
I have. It's not good.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.813
There was a painting on the wall
of Martin Luther King

18:24.813 --> 18:26.481
on a surfboard with Fred Flintstone,

18:27.065 --> 18:29.693
and even in the painting
Martin Luther King was like, "Really?"

18:29.693 --> 18:33.822
Whatever. Whatever. I googled them,
and there's a fuck ton of them.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.199
Meaning we can make a lot of money.

18:35.199 --> 18:39.828
You know, what makes me sad at night
is how obsessed with "money" everyone is.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.371
Well, we live in America.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.666
- Right. It's a capitalist society.
- With money, you can buy a car.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.335
Or it gets you a printer for your house,

18:46.335 --> 18:48.504
so you can get me that fucking W-4
I've been asking for.

18:48.504 --> 18:51.089
- I know the things money does.
- You know what I think?

18:51.089 --> 18:53.383
You don't want this deal
to work out because it came from Reggie,

18:53.383 --> 18:55.761
and you fucking hate Reggie
because he's Audrey's brother.

18:55.761 --> 18:57.971
And you're clearly not over
your goddamn divorce

18:57.971 --> 19:00.599
so you're gonna tank every idea he has,
even if it's a fucking good one.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.809
That's actually very insightful.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.646
- This is about the divorce, and--
- Don't start fucking therapizing me.

19:05.646 --> 19:09.066
- Go open a practice together.
- Fuck, maybe we should. Maybe we should.

19:09.066 --> 19:12.069
I bet you I'd make more money there
than I do in this fucking place.

19:12.069 --> 19:15.739
Look, I'm just saying it wouldn't kill us
to get a little more liquid. That's all.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.701
All I know is that this place
is always full, and we're both doing fine.

19:19.701 --> 19:23.664
Fuck fine. I want more than fine.
Goddamn it. You know this.

19:23.664 --> 19:27.376
I wanna be married, bro.
I wanna start a family, do family shit.

19:27.376 --> 19:30.170
You just think you want that. You don't
actually fucking want that. You're fine.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.839
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.096
- Will?
- Yeah.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.598
You're spilling the beer.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.393
I know I am. Can't serve beer
if there is no beer.

19:44.393 --> 19:45.811
Hey, what are you doing?

19:45.811 --> 19:48.438
Hey, Omar. Will you help me
empty this tank over here?

19:48.438 --> 19:49.439
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

19:50.482 --> 19:53.235
These tanks look like
they hold a lot of beer.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.152
They do.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.697
And that's a very small hose,
and there's a lot of tanks in here.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.699
But it is a largely symbolic gesture.

19:58.699 --> 20:01.326
Well, and there's also some
cans of beer behind you.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.037
Those are cider, not beer.
But I can empty those too.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.164
Yeah. You'd like the cider.
Ladies love cider.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.666
- Dude, Will.
- I do like cider.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.626
- I'm Sylvia.
- Will, what the fuck are you doing, bro?

20:09.626 --> 20:12.337
- Hey.
- Goddamn it! What the-- Stop it.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.380
Gimme the fucking-- Don't--

20:13.380 --> 20:14.548
Stop it!

20:14.548 --> 20:17.050
- No! I won't stop. No!
- Hey. Gimme the hose.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.844
- Get outta here.
- No! Fuck you.

20:18.844 --> 20:21.555
It's in my eyes, you dick!
What are you doing?

20:21.555 --> 20:22.931
I will not go down without a fight!

20:23.807 --> 20:26.351
What you said
about Audrey is not true, okay?

20:26.351 --> 20:29.229
Yeah, I've moved on from that.
I've resolved that situation emotionally.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.481
I even got my stuff
out of her place, okay?

20:31.481 --> 20:33.609
This has to do with the fact
that I hate Reggie,

20:33.609 --> 20:36.987
and I do not hate him because
he is Audrey's stepbrother!

20:36.987 --> 20:39.448
I hate him because
he's a fucking piece of shit!

20:39.448 --> 20:40.532
Goodbye.

20:43.327 --> 20:44.328
Dick!

20:45.662 --> 20:50.000
Am I gonna have to clean this up? Because
it seems like it shouldn't be my job.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.754
Motherfucker,
we both have to clean this up.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.380
It's only four people that work in here.

20:57.799 --> 20:58.800
Yo. Hey.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.427
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:01.345 --> 21:02.804
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.098
It's just work shit.
That's our normal, everyday dynamic.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.683
And I think it's quite healthy actually.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.020
I've never seen anything like that.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.314
That's, like, the biggest argument
I've ever seen. Wow.

21:12.314 --> 21:15.025
I'm proud of where we've gotten,
to be honest. It used to be much worse.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.027
What are you doing now?
Do you wanna hang out?

21:17.027 --> 21:18.612
Yeah. No, I can't.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.239
I gotta go back to the Omni.

21:20.239 --> 21:21.365
You're staying at the Omni?

21:21.365 --> 21:24.451
You cashing in on Air Miles
for a sexy weekend?

21:25.077 --> 21:26.662
Charlie's got a work reception there.

21:26.662 --> 21:29.623
I actually have to meet him
in 20 minutes. I'm late. Yeah.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.959
I haven't seen Charlie in forever.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.877
I love that guy.
I would love to see Charlie.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.296
- Really?
- I mean, unless you don't want me to come.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.632
No. You really want to come?

21:38.632 --> 21:40.634
Yeah. Thanks. I got nothing going on.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.010
Okay. Well...

21:42.010 --> 21:44.054
I can't get a Lyft.
It's, like, 25 minutes away.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.181
Yeah. Lyfts are too scared
to come to this neighborhood.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.266
We'll take a scooter.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.433
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.311
Never been on one of these before.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.438
Yeah? Use that one. My treat.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.525
It's got a lot of bird poop on that one.

21:56.525 --> 21:59.152
Sure does. This one's busted.

22:03.699 --> 22:04.700
Why?

22:04.700 --> 22:07.661
Why do people do anything?
It's a complicated question.

22:09.872 --> 22:12.249
Do you think this is a good idea
if you've had a few drinks?

22:12.749 --> 22:15.085
I think they invented these
for people who had a few drinks.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.395
You like the beer?

22:33.395 --> 22:34.479
No. Terrible.

22:35.189 --> 22:36.732
- You want another one?
- 'Course.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.492
- What's happening?
- Toss 'em.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.827
It's part of their terms of service.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.370
They want you to do it.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.622
Get down!

22:51.622 --> 22:53.123
- Okay. Yeah!
- Get it!

22:54.666 --> 22:58.462
I'm just gonna go up to the room and get
changed, so just wait for me down here.

22:58.462 --> 22:59.796
- Okay. Yeah. No problem.
- Okay.

22:59.796 --> 23:00.881
Hey, there's Charlie.

23:01.465 --> 23:03.550
Hey, Charlie. What's up, man?

23:03.550 --> 23:05.761
No. I've gotta take off
these clothes. What are you doing?

23:05.761 --> 23:06.970
It's too late. He's coming over.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.389
- Surprised. Did not expect to see you.
- Hi. Look at you.

23:09.389 --> 23:13.560
You look beautiful, sir.
And even firmer than last time,

23:13.560 --> 23:14.978
and you were firm as fuck, my friend.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.397
Thank you. You look great too.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.441
That's not true.
I look bad. I've had a rough year.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.693
- Hi. I'm Stewart.
- Will. Nice to meet you.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.446
We all used to work together,
like, a hundred years ago.

23:24.446 --> 23:27.115
- Cool.
- You two look festive.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.744
Actually, he looks a lot better than
what he did at the beginning of the day.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.538
You should have seen his outfit.

23:32.538 --> 23:35.207
Oh, my God. He looked insane. No offense.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.084
I'd be offended
if you did like how I dress.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.461
You look like you live in Ann Taylor Loft.

23:40.629 --> 23:42.673
I love Ann Taylor.
They have great styling.

23:42.673 --> 23:44.049
They do. Very beige.

23:44.049 --> 23:48.387
Okay, Sylvia. We get it.
You got a hot bod. Cease and desist.

23:49.471 --> 23:52.349
Hey. Vanessa. I'm a partner
at the same firm as Charlie.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.393
- I'm Will. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

23:54.393 --> 23:56.895
I'm not a lawyer, but good for you. Yeah.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.105
So, Sylvia,

23:58.105 --> 24:02.192
what'd you get up to with your day while
we were stuck in an M&A strategy session?

24:02.192 --> 24:03.861
Little spa time for Mama?

24:05.529 --> 24:06.864
Did Mama have some spa time?

24:07.906 --> 24:09.408
- You saw I made the funny one laugh?
- Yeah.

24:09.408 --> 24:10.742
Yeah, I'm not a clown.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.663
Charlie, you free for dinner
after my speech?

24:14.663 --> 24:17.958
The Winer and Finling people and I
are going to The Palm for surf and turf.

24:18.542 --> 24:19.543
I'm going.

24:19.543 --> 24:21.295
You should definitely go.

24:21.295 --> 24:23.881
Darling, can I get a Johnnie Walker
on the rocks, please?

24:24.673 --> 24:26.800
I'm sorry. I'm not a waitress here.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.553
My mistake. I'm Frank Schaeffer.

24:29.553 --> 24:31.346
I know. I've met you like 200 times.

24:32.055 --> 24:32.973
That's my speech.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.766
How about we play a little game?

24:35.309 --> 24:40.063
I give you your speech back if you can
remember my name in three guesses.

24:40.731 --> 24:41.982
Okay.

24:42.733 --> 24:45.611
- Sweetie. I--
- Nobody hints. No hints. No hints.

24:45.611 --> 24:48.238
I remember. You're Charlie's wife.

24:48.238 --> 24:51.033
No. Not a name.
"Charlie's wife" is not a name.

24:51.033 --> 24:52.951
- Was that a guess?
- You have two more guesses left.

24:52.951 --> 24:55.078
It's like Rumpelstiltskin
but very awkward.

24:55.078 --> 24:58.081
- Okay, sweetie. I--
- It's very funny. Very, very funny.

24:58.081 --> 25:00.375
But I know your name. It's Marni.

25:00.959 --> 25:04.546
Nope. Cool name. I could be a Marni.
Not my name.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.216
So you have one guess left.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.176
All right, we've had our fun.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.345
Let me take my speech back
'cause I'm gonna need it.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.514
- Nope. You have one more guess.
- All right.

25:14.932 --> 25:15.766
Sylvia.

25:15.766 --> 25:17.017
Hey, no hints.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.311
I remember your name.

25:20.729 --> 25:21.730
Cynthia.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.148
Nope. It's Sylvia.

25:23.982 --> 25:25.984
Shit. She did it. She fucking did it.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.486
Now you're gonna remember who I am.

25:27.486 --> 25:28.779
That's my speech.

25:28.779 --> 25:31.740
She said, "Now you'll remember who I am."

25:31.740 --> 25:33.492
Next time you'll remember my name.

25:33.492 --> 25:35.077
She said next time
you'll remember her name.

25:35.077 --> 25:37.037
- Thank you.
- Okay. All right.

25:38.539 --> 25:39.998
Get her some barbecue sauce.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.917
When I do shrooms, I use barbecue sauce.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.460
Let's get you a glass of water.

25:45.629 --> 25:47.381
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.508
That was insane.
That's gonna fuck up your tummy.

25:49.508 --> 25:50.759
Where did that come from?

25:50.759 --> 25:54.638
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what
happened. I just lost it. I saw red and--

25:54.638 --> 25:57.683
I know that Frank is an asshole,
but seriously, that was over the top.

25:57.683 --> 26:00.018
- I know. I--
- This door locked behind us.

26:00.018 --> 26:02.229
- I'm trapped out here with you.
- I see that guy every day.

26:02.229 --> 26:04.273
I have to kiss his ass.
I have to be on his good side.

26:04.273 --> 26:06.066
I have to go
on one of his fishing trips now.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.068
I have avoided them for years,
but now I have to do it.

26:08.068 --> 26:10.654
I hate that weird little lodge.
There are bunk beds.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.322
- I know. I'm sorry.
- And now I have to do it.

26:12.322 --> 26:15.659
Truly, Sylvia, what was that about?

26:15.659 --> 26:18.161
Why didn't you just tell me
that Vanessa was making partner?

26:18.161 --> 26:20.205
Why?
I know that didn't slip your mind, babe.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.667
Because I knew if I told you, you would
do something insane like you just did.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.961
I'm your husband. I'm not blind.

26:25.961 --> 26:28.755
You could have had a career
like Vanessa's but you chose not to.

26:29.590 --> 26:32.843
I chose to watch our children grow up.

26:33.886 --> 26:37.389
And those are precious years.
I'm grateful for that. I'm glad I did it,

26:37.389 --> 26:40.684
but it doesn't mean that it's not hard
for me to come somewhere like this.

26:40.684 --> 26:43.687
I just feel insecure,
and seeing all of these old colleagues

26:43.687 --> 26:46.732
and they're just treating me
like I'm an invisible ghost.

26:47.733 --> 26:51.069
Okay, fine. If you want to
get back into the law, you can.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.405
You just have to find something
that excites you.

26:53.989 --> 26:56.533
Really? I've been out of the workforce
for 13 years.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.410
That's a real asset to an employer.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.704
- It's a key card situation, so...
- Okay.

27:00.704 --> 27:04.124
I am not saying that there won't be
bars to entry, but you have a law degree.

27:04.124 --> 27:07.002
You are a very good lawyer.
If you want to do it, you can.

27:07.002 --> 27:08.712
But I'm not just a lawyer, Charlie.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.756
I'm also a mom.
I have to pick up my kids at 2:00.

27:10.756 --> 27:11.840
No. Not necessarily true.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.384
There are plenty of rewarding jobs
that you can do from 9:00 until 2:00.

27:14.384 --> 27:15.302
Really?

27:15.302 --> 27:17.596
Why don't you tell your boss
you're gonna do a five-hour workday?

27:17.596 --> 27:19.014
Tell me how that goes.

27:23.143 --> 27:26.063
Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt,
but Frank's about to give his speech.

27:26.063 --> 27:27.898
You probably don't want to miss that.

27:31.068 --> 27:33.487
- Just go.
- I'm sorry.

27:33.487 --> 27:36.532
- We will discuss later.
- Yes, yes.

27:40.953 --> 27:42.079
Come on. Go with him.

27:42.079 --> 27:44.248
No. He doesn't want me in there.

27:44.248 --> 27:47.501
He does. Your very, very, very attractive
husband does want you in there.

27:47.501 --> 27:50.420
Also, you ate that guy's fucking speech.
You got to see what he says.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.675
I kind of know what his speech
is gonna be like in my gut.

27:55.342 --> 27:56.635
Goddamn! That's solid.

27:57.636 --> 28:00.389
Even in these dark times,
bringing the heat.

28:00.389 --> 28:01.849
- Thanks, buddy.
- Get in there.

28:07.521 --> 28:09.898
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Fuck.

28:35.591 --> 28:39.219
- <i>Sunday morning.</i>
- <i>I love fruit.</i>

28:40.095 --> 28:41.096
Skaagn.

29:00.157 --> 29:01.783
Do you have a business center?

29:42.074 --> 29:43.075
What is that?

29:43.075 --> 29:45.494
My W-4. You've been asking for it.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.578
Okay.

29:47.162 --> 29:49.581
- You know you have to fill it out, right?
- I do. Can I borrow your pen?

29:49.581 --> 29:52.292
- Yes, you can. Here you go.
- Thank you.

29:52.292 --> 29:56.463
- What is my federal tax ID number?
- You should probably know that.

29:56.463 --> 29:59.424
Yeah. I don't know that.
My mom has all that information.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.009
I love your mom.

30:03.804 --> 30:05.305
What are we serving the Johnny 66 guy?

30:06.807 --> 30:07.808
Probably everything.

30:08.392 --> 30:11.353
- That cool with you, brewmaster?
- It is.

30:12.479 --> 30:13.480
The jumpsuit.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.899
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah. I'm super into it.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.235
It's super cool.
We should totally sell these.

30:18.235 --> 30:19.778
- Fuck, yeah.
- It's comfortable too.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.071
Hell yeah. It looks comfortable.

30:21.071 --> 30:24.658
It is hard to pee in, but overall,
you know, very, very nice.

30:24.658 --> 30:25.993
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:26.869 --> 30:27.703
<i>Next year,</i>

30:28.537 --> 30:30.205
we're just gonna keep--

30:31.248 --> 30:36.837
We're gonna keep building on that bigness,
and--

30:38.213 --> 30:42.259
We're gonna expand to a level...

30:43.802 --> 30:46.638
that'll be the next level.

30:51.018 --> 30:57.107
You know, the arc of the universe
bends toward--

31:00.235 --> 31:02.446
Well, thank you.

31:09.286 --> 31:11.121
That was a great speech.

31:11.121 --> 31:12.581
Thank you, Sylvia.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.968
- It worked. He remembered my name.
- Yeah.

31:24.968 --> 31:26.512
He just said, "Thank you, Sylvia."
