00:46.916 --> 00:47.875
Hello?

00:50.458 --> 00:51.416
Guys?

01:06.166 --> 01:07.708
Wraith hunting without me?

01:48.458 --> 01:51.250
How could you not realize
it was an execution site?

01:51.333 --> 01:53.625
Because you gave me
no time for research, again!

01:53.708 --> 01:57.125
They had time to figure it out! They knew
exactly what they were walking into.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.625
They don't have to actually visit
the libraries and churches.

01:59.708 --> 02:00.625
-I do!
-Hey.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.333
Uh…

02:03.958 --> 02:04.791
Hiya.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.125
-How are you… feeling?
-Normal.

02:08.833 --> 02:11.708
-Thanks for letting me sleep in.
-Are you sure you're okay?

02:11.791 --> 02:13.583
Yeah, I'm fine. How about you guys?

02:14.125 --> 02:17.250
-I'm guessing you didn't find that wraith?
-Oh, no, we did.

02:17.958 --> 02:20.333
But then we found 13 others,
didn't we, George?

02:20.416 --> 02:22.666
-Total cluster case.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.500
-We didn't have flares, did we, Lockwood?
-How did you get out?

02:26.500 --> 02:29.125
-We were rescued.
-We were not "rescued."

02:29.208 --> 02:30.625
-Oh shit.

02:31.208 --> 02:33.708
-Kipps' crew?
-Stuck-up mediocrities.

02:34.916 --> 02:38.250
They saved our lives, killed the wraiths,
and sealed the source.

02:38.333 --> 02:40.583
-It was quite dazzling.
-Did they share the fee?

02:40.666 --> 02:42.041
No, finders keepers.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.291
-But that's not what this is about.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.583
He wouldn't even acknowledge.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.083
He's acting like
Combe Carey Hall never happened.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.208
He must've signed the same NDA we did.

02:51.291 --> 02:55.416
Yes, but he could let us know
that he knows. He lacks respect.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.625
But you know he knows.

02:58.291 --> 03:00.916
-But he won't show he knows.
-It was annoying.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.666
'Cause you take the lie, and you take
Kipps's face and put them together--

03:04.750 --> 03:07.250
And you just wanna watch him…

03:08.208 --> 03:09.333
die.

03:12.125 --> 03:12.958
Sorry.

03:13.583 --> 03:14.916
Very long night.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.708
Please tell me there's tea.

03:18.791 --> 03:22.125
-You realize you slept for 14 hours?
-Did I?

03:22.208 --> 03:24.291
I don't actually remember going to bed.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.041
Do you remember
us carrying you?

03:26.125 --> 03:28.500
-We found you unconscious in the basement.
-What?

03:28.583 --> 03:30.333
You don't remember anything?

03:30.416 --> 03:34.375
No, I definitely remember
putting the papers away, but that was it.

03:35.541 --> 03:37.666
And you're not getting any hallucinations?

03:37.750 --> 03:39.416
-Or weird voices?
-No.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.916
No, like I said, I feel…

03:41.958 --> 03:42.833
normal.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.375
Well, we don't have any appointments.
It's probably mad old Mrs. Wick again.

03:54.458 --> 03:57.375
You're just not rude enough
to her, George. Watch how it's done.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.583
Hello. Mr. Lockwood?

04:02.666 --> 04:05.416
-Yes. Please, come in.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.750
Come on. We've got a proper client.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.250
I'm Sebastian Saunders,
and this is my partner, Pamela Joplin.

04:22.791 --> 04:24.000
Business partner.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.916
We're Sweet Dreams Excavations.
Maybe you've heard of us?

04:27.416 --> 04:28.708
You're gravediggers?

04:28.791 --> 04:32.208
We prefer
"excavation and clearance."

04:32.291 --> 04:35.541
I'm sure you'll have seen the headlines,
Mr. Lockwood.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.250
-After all the avoidable deaths,

04:37.333 --> 04:42.750
DEPRAC now require councils to assess
their cemeteries for risky plots.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.000
We're currently engaged in
a major operation

04:46.083 --> 04:47.791
in Kensal Green Cemetery.

04:47.875 --> 04:51.041
-But that's huge.
-Thank you.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.166
Pam usually susses out the dodgy ones

04:53.250 --> 04:55.875
long before they present
any serious danger.

04:55.958 --> 04:59.000
We dig for bones. She digs for stories.

04:59.083 --> 05:02.583
I use burial records
to look for traumatic causes of death

05:02.666 --> 05:04.541
likely to tip the odds for visitation.

05:05.291 --> 05:07.583
Suicides, murders, sudden tragedy.

05:08.291 --> 05:11.250
You never know
when a spirit might activate.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.500
You're a researcher?

05:12.583 --> 05:14.791
Did you know
Fittes has its own database now?

05:14.875 --> 05:18.791
It's not very good.
Broad in scope, but there's no depth.

05:18.875 --> 05:22.250
-Give me a stack of books any day.
-I couldn't agree more.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.958
Mr. Saunders, Ms. Joplin, thank you
very much for taking the trouble.

05:26.041 --> 05:28.125
But we're mansion specialists.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.916
We don't do odd jobs for the council.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.916
Are you sure? We heard you'd be grateful.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.791
-Oh, sorry. Uh… amenable to this work.
-Well, you heard wrong.

05:35.875 --> 05:38.916
Our listener, for example,
is one of the best in the country, and--

05:39.000 --> 05:40.125
Lockwood, I'm good.

05:41.125 --> 05:41.958
That's all.

05:42.583 --> 05:46.041
We're good.
We're just a good, normal agency…

05:47.000 --> 05:48.208
…who needs a job.

05:51.625 --> 05:55.125
Kensal Green
is London's most prestigious cemetery,

05:55.208 --> 05:57.291
owned and run by the Bickerstaff family--

05:57.375 --> 06:00.791
Until one of the sons
was caught diggin' up corpses.

06:00.875 --> 06:04.791
The scandal that brought the word
"necrophilia" into common usage.

06:04.875 --> 06:08.666
Yes, but before then,
the clientele was very high-end.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.833
And the grave in question
is in the older section?

06:12.541 --> 06:13.791
The classy one?

06:14.500 --> 06:15.833
-The classy one?
-Yes.

06:16.458 --> 06:17.291
Pre-pleb?

06:17.375 --> 06:19.500
Where the bodies
were dug up by the pervert?

06:19.583 --> 06:22.291
Well, a visitor
with historical significance

06:22.375 --> 06:23.958
would be more attractive to us.

06:24.791 --> 06:28.416
It is within the original curtilage, yes,
but I can't give you a name.

06:29.083 --> 06:32.500
A hidden, unmarked grave
that's not on any official list.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.750
One of our sensitives found it,

06:34.833 --> 06:39.833
triggered by an extreme nausea
which eventually made her pass out.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.166
Whatever's inside there, it's powerful.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.958
We've a legal obligation
to bring in agents

06:47.041 --> 06:49.708
for any grave
which might contain a Type Two.

06:50.333 --> 06:51.916
DEPRAC cover the expense,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.708
so the work <i>must </i>be done at night

06:54.791 --> 06:57.208
so our claims can be verified.

06:57.916 --> 07:01.291
Bureaucratic BS,
but, uh… makes things interesting.

07:01.958 --> 07:03.416
You'll be well-supported.

07:03.500 --> 07:08.625
We've got night watch, sensitives,
security to keep out the relic men.

07:08.708 --> 07:11.708
The cemetery
really comes alive at night.

07:12.208 --> 07:15.000
So… you're telling me

07:15.833 --> 07:20.458
you think there is an unidentified
Type Two in an unmarked grave,

07:20.541 --> 07:24.083
and you want us
to come and help you dig it up… at night?

07:25.166 --> 07:29.000
Put like that, Mr. Lockwood,
I admit it could sound better.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.416
Ms. Joplin.

07:31.041 --> 07:33.666
It sounds irresistible.

08:40.291 --> 08:44.083
Okay, let's keep our wits about us.
We do not want to get jumped by relic men.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.875
Who even keeps those arseholes
in business? I don't understand.

08:47.958 --> 08:50.166
There's a lot of rich,
twisted bastards out there

08:50.250 --> 08:53.000
who want something
to scandalize their equally twisted mates.

08:53.083 --> 08:55.291
-It's so messed up.
-But not surprising.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.208
Sources are fascinating and illegal.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.541
Put those things together,
there's your black market.

08:59.625 --> 09:03.000
A ruthless one at that.
Relic men are the scum of the earth.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.875
-I know one notable exception,

09:04.958 --> 09:06.250
-but by and large…

09:06.333 --> 09:07.791
…they'll kill you without hesitation.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.666
So, if you see one, run.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.958
This lot are almost as crazy.

09:13.041 --> 09:15.583
-Who are they?

09:16.208 --> 09:17.250
Ghost cult.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.333
They think instead of fighting visitors,
we should be welcoming them in.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.791
-They're the Venn diagram intersection

09:22.875 --> 09:24.833
for noisy, angry, and deliberately thick.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.416
So kind, honestly.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.166
Sorry, there's no autographs tonight.
Thank you, though.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.291
-Murdering scum! There's no business--

09:40.958 --> 09:42.333
That was horrible.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.416
You get used to it.
It's this bit I don't like.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.875
I know most of the dead here
are properly dead, but--

09:48.958 --> 09:51.291
It still feels
like enemy territory.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.083
Jesus.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.833
Like the man said,
the cemetery really comes alive at night.

09:59.916 --> 10:01.541
Who are all these people?

10:02.041 --> 10:03.291
It's the security.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.000
And the, uh… gravediggers.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.375
Proper, honest blokes, you know?
Real salt of the earth.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.291
You've never even spoken to them.

10:10.958 --> 10:11.916
They're a bit scary.

10:12.708 --> 10:16.291
Night watch. Lowest pay,
lowest life expectancy in the business.

10:16.375 --> 10:19.666
They need to unionize.
I've told them a thousand times.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.041
That could've been me.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.500
But it's not, luckily.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.541
You've dealt with sensitives
before, right?

10:24.625 --> 10:25.541
No. Why?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.166
They're basically listeners
too scared to pick up a rapier

10:28.250 --> 10:29.333
or too posh to need to.

10:29.416 --> 10:32.208
This lot, anyway. Highgate sensitives.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.000
That's completely disrespectful.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.041
-Go write a poem about it.
-You all signed contracts!

10:37.125 --> 10:38.500
-Legally binding!
-What an arsehole.

10:38.583 --> 10:42.125
Risk is exactly what I'm paying you for.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.208
Ah, Mr. Lockwood. Just in time.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.958
These troublemakers are refusing
to let their teams work.

10:47.041 --> 10:50.208
It's not safe, and you know it.
You call it risk. I call it suicide.

10:50.291 --> 10:54.375
Even I can sense it, and I haven't been
able to see a visitor for 35 years!

10:54.458 --> 10:58.083
Which is exactly
why we have hired these agents,

10:58.166 --> 11:01.541
the best of the best,
to deal with the whole situation.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.041
Where's their uniform?
Where's their supervisor?

11:04.125 --> 11:08.500
Myself and my team refuse to work
near that grave until it's made safe.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.875
It's making us ill.

11:10.958 --> 11:12.791
Ignore them. Let's get inside.

11:12.875 --> 11:16.166
Mr. Saunders, if I could,
just for one moment…

11:16.250 --> 11:17.333
I don't trust 'em.

11:17.416 --> 11:19.541
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.333
My name is Anthony Lockwood,
of Lockwood & Co.,

11:22.416 --> 11:25.583
and I'm here tonight with my team
to assist you all.

11:25.666 --> 11:29.583
Now, let me assure you,
your safety is our number one priority.

11:29.666 --> 11:33.125
Get us proper agents!
Get us Fittes! Get us Rotwell!

11:33.208 --> 11:36.791
Sir, I guarantee you
we are the best agents in London.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.500
The only reason you haven't heard of us

11:38.583 --> 11:42.208
is because we don't do our work
for applause or attention.

11:42.291 --> 11:45.875
No, we do our work
discreetly and bespokely.

11:45.958 --> 11:49.875
Now, I am certain that no one
knows this cemetery quite like you do.

11:50.458 --> 11:53.541
We will do nothing without a full
consultation on what you have seen.

11:54.416 --> 11:58.625
And, Miss, you have clearly
had a terrible experience,

11:58.708 --> 12:00.416
so please, take all the time you need,

12:00.500 --> 12:03.416
and when you and your team
feel strong enough,

12:04.125 --> 12:06.125
you will have my undivided attention.

12:07.041 --> 12:07.875
Fine.

12:10.416 --> 12:11.791
Saunders.

12:11.875 --> 12:15.250
If we ever really get famous,
he'll be absolutely unbearable.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.541
Sorry about all that.
I'm short-staffed at the moment.

12:19.625 --> 12:22.791
Joplin's got her head
in a coroner's report somewhere.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.958
Unusual table you've got there.

12:25.041 --> 12:28.125
It's a catafalque, according to Joplin.
Gawd knows what it does.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.541
It's a lift to take coffins
to the catacombs.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.000
I'd never normally say this,

12:32.083 --> 12:34.583
but you really shouldn't be using it
to serve biscuits.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.375
I work with what I've got.

12:36.958 --> 12:39.833
-Right, let's get this signed.
-What happened at the incident?

12:40.416 --> 12:45.875
The gravediggers mistimed it. Got caught
with an exposed casket as the sun set.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.125
Did anyone see a visitor?

12:47.208 --> 12:49.125
Sensitives can't get
their stories straight.

12:49.208 --> 12:52.000
Apart from the fact they're all sick
and need a lie-down.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.916
No backbone, your generation.

12:54.416 --> 12:57.791
-You said the casket was exposed?
-Yes, but not open.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.458
That's your job.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.166
You'll be on your own.

13:01.250 --> 13:04.041
I'll not have anyone else near that grave
until it's made safe.

13:04.125 --> 13:05.666
I can't risk any more disruption.

13:05.750 --> 13:09.208
You said we'd be well-supported.
This is not what we agreed.

13:09.708 --> 13:12.958
What if there are relic men,
or some other active visitors out there?

13:13.583 --> 13:17.416
If you wish to complain,
just complete the relevant paperwork.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.791
-I am not filling out more forms.
-Suit yourself.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.833
But you're still under contract.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.458
We shouldn't even be here.
We should be front-page news.

13:32.541 --> 13:34.458
-Lockwood, let's just get it done.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.083
Come on.

13:49.041 --> 13:51.333
They really did leave in a hurry.

13:51.416 --> 13:52.583
Okay.

13:54.916 --> 13:55.916
Ready?

14:09.250 --> 14:10.708
There's no death-glows.

14:11.791 --> 14:13.041
Nothing else visible.

14:13.958 --> 14:14.791
Got anything?

14:15.333 --> 14:16.166
Nope.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.416
-Some kind of…

14:18.500 --> 14:20.791
-…vibration.

14:37.708 --> 14:38.625
Great.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.875
George takes first inspection. Watch him.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.000
I'll take lookout. Let's not hang about.

14:47.791 --> 14:48.833
In position.

14:54.916 --> 14:55.750
Be careful.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.583
It knows you're there.

15:04.958 --> 15:08.208
This casket's not level,
and it's not as deep as it should be.

15:08.291 --> 15:11.250
So we've got a rushed, illegal,
and very amateur burial

15:11.333 --> 15:13.208
which has been here
as long as these other plots.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.708
-Oh God…

15:14.791 --> 15:16.250
Why hasn't it rotted?

15:17.416 --> 15:18.791
Keep the light steady!

15:18.875 --> 15:22.000
Oh, this thing is strong.
I don't feel good.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.708
-Joplin's coming.
-Well, keep her away.

15:26.291 --> 15:27.916
-Everything all right?

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Sebastian said he'd sent you down here
without any help. I can only apologize.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.083
<i>Lucy.</i>

15:53.708 --> 15:54.708
Luce?

15:55.208 --> 15:57.125
What's going on? Are you okay?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.500
Where's my light?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.875
It's here. I've got you.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.333
-This coffin's made of iron.

16:07.416 --> 16:08.291
Get out.

16:11.041 --> 16:14.125
Okay. Okay. The coffin's made of iron,

16:14.208 --> 16:17.625
but it was put in the ground
way before the Problem started.

16:17.708 --> 16:20.708
So, what exactly is in there
that they needed to trap?

16:20.791 --> 16:22.875
And how did they know
how to do it?

16:22.958 --> 16:25.625
-We need to regroup, research--
-No time.

16:25.708 --> 16:28.666
There's a hole in the casket.
We need to open it and seal the source.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.708
-Lucy, are you okay?

16:30.791 --> 16:32.750
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.333
It's just… Can you hear those flies?
What is that?

16:36.416 --> 16:40.208
No. But… I'm getting
intense waves of nausea.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.916
-Let's get back to the casket.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.583
I'll protect you.
Deal with whatever's inside, then…

16:45.666 --> 16:47.541
Luce, grab the net.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.916
<i>Lucy…</i>

16:54.666 --> 16:55.500
<i>Lucy!</i>

16:57.458 --> 16:59.125
-What is it?
Come on, focus.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.250
Don't get distracted.
Bring the net.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.958
Oh shit!

17:13.125 --> 17:15.541
Hello? Can I get some help, please?

17:15.625 --> 17:17.000
Yes! Help!

17:17.083 --> 17:18.000
-Help!

17:18.875 --> 17:21.166
This isn't a coffin at all.
There's a door in it.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.041
They're coming out
through that gap.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.791
-So loud!
-Lucy, stand by!

17:27.125 --> 17:28.166
No!

17:33.416 --> 17:35.750
-No!
-It won't budge.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.208
Please, just make it stop!

17:52.583 --> 17:53.666
Make it stop…

18:11.125 --> 18:12.125
Lucy!

18:13.583 --> 18:14.416
Seal it up!

18:25.916 --> 18:28.125
Here comes the cavalry. Finally.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.500
God.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.958
-…come down that way…
-Yeah, keep your eyes peeled…

18:34.458 --> 18:36.541
It's safe now. We secured it.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.875
-Okay, we've got it from here.

18:39.708 --> 18:41.791
-Luce, you okay?
-Right, people.

18:41.875 --> 18:44.750
-Coffin and body into the chapel.
-I'm fine. It was just an accident.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.208
Are you okay, George?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.250
-George?
-Yes, I'm here.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.583
-What was that?
-Not our finest hour.

18:53.208 --> 18:55.583
-Whatever it is, we contained it, so--
-Did we?

18:56.166 --> 18:58.708
-I still feel… weird. I…

18:58.791 --> 19:01.250
Can you guys still hear flies?
I can hear flies and…

19:01.333 --> 19:04.333
-…grid reference…
-Don't know. There's just too much noise.

19:05.041 --> 19:08.041
What was that in there with him?
Some sort of ornament? A mirror?

19:08.125 --> 19:12.083
I don't know. It… it was black,
but there was something in the blackness.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.750
I… I didn't see it directly,
but it felt like it was looking at me.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.416
Could explain the iron casket.

19:20.500 --> 19:24.416
It must've been down there over a hundred
years, way before the Problem started.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.333
Silver and iron have always been used
by the superstitious.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.541
He was shot in the head too, did you see?

19:29.625 --> 19:32.916
Yeah, it's not our problem.
A job's a job, and it's done now,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.250
so it's time for DEPRAC
to go and tidy it all up.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.208
See?

19:37.291 --> 19:40.541
All someone had to do
was apply themselves.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.666
Wasn't so difficult, was it?
Good work, Mr. Lockwood.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.708
If you'll come with me, sign a few forms,
I can release payment.

19:46.791 --> 19:48.416
-Perfect.
-Well done.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.041
-Keep an eye on George.
-Yeah.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.875
Is it wrong
that I feel a bit excited? Sorry.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.416
It's just so nice
being part of a… proper team.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.833
Um…

19:56.916 --> 19:59.500
-Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

19:59.583 --> 20:03.000
I just need any details
that might help identifying the body.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.625
Sorry, just… excuse me one second.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.458
It's okay. I can do it.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.750
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure. Come on.

20:24.625 --> 20:25.666
Sign that…

20:25.750 --> 20:27.125
-There you go.
-Lovely, thanks.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.166
Then I think we've got one here from--

20:29.250 --> 20:31.708
-Where's she gone?
-The council, this one.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.458
Lucy.

20:47.458 --> 20:48.583
Lucy!

20:50.291 --> 20:51.458
Lucy!

20:54.708 --> 20:56.125
It said my name.

20:57.458 --> 21:01.250
It spoke to me.
That thing, it… it said my name.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.083
-I'll have that back.
-Thank you.

21:03.166 --> 21:05.291
Pleasure doing business with you,
Mr. Lockwood.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.958
George, don't cross the chain.

21:11.958 --> 21:14.250
Where would we even
start research on this?

21:17.583 --> 21:21.083
And the object you saw inside,
were there any identifying marks?

21:21.166 --> 21:23.166
I didn't get a good enough look at it.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.416
No. No! George.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.625
-The net!

21:31.958 --> 21:33.333
-No!

22:05.291 --> 22:07.125
No!

22:10.416 --> 22:11.416
George!

22:33.166 --> 22:35.166
Lucy. Lucy!

22:41.208 --> 22:42.625
Oh, just do it, just do it.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.125
-Okay. Okay.

22:48.875 --> 22:50.333
You spoke to me.

22:52.375 --> 22:53.666
-You.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.416
You.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.458
Come closer.

22:59.708 --> 23:02.250
-Thank you.
-Oh, you can talk.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.416
You can hear me.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
No, no, no, no, no. I must be losing it.

23:05.583 --> 23:07.541
No. Finding it.

23:07.625 --> 23:11.166
-I've been so lonely.
-No, but… this is an actual conversation!

23:11.250 --> 23:13.125
You're a Type Three.

23:13.208 --> 23:16.291
-Yes, so dangerous.
-Yeah, I know that.

23:16.375 --> 23:19.500
Not me. <i>Them, </i>if they find out.

23:19.583 --> 23:22.625
-What? Who?
-The boy has secrets.

23:22.708 --> 23:23.958
The door!

23:24.041 --> 23:25.875
-What? Lockwood?
-I can explain.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.916
But not in this jar.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Let me out.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.208
No. I can't do that.

23:33.291 --> 23:36.583
But I've so much to show you, teach you.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.375
Trust me.

23:46.166 --> 23:48.666
No, wait. No, ju--

23:49.250 --> 23:50.916
-Where have you been?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.333
Working, at the cemetery.

23:53.416 --> 23:55.041
-Which cemetery?
-What?

23:55.125 --> 23:57.250
-You've been near power.
-How do you know that?

23:57.333 --> 24:00.916
Tell me where you've been.
Tell me! Death is coming!

24:01.000 --> 24:02.750
-You're demented!
-Death is coming!

24:02.833 --> 24:05.125
-Shut up! Please, just shut up!
-Death is coming!

24:18.250 --> 24:21.833
You let a non-agent
inside the iron circle.

24:21.916 --> 24:22.875
I'm sorry.

24:23.375 --> 24:27.333
Joplin asked about identifiers,
and I'd seen an inscription on the mirror.

24:27.416 --> 24:29.958
-Now I've got it to translate.
-No, George, we are done.

24:30.458 --> 24:32.708
If it wasn't for Lucy, you would be dead.

24:32.791 --> 24:36.500
There are ghosts and then there's us,
and it is kill or be killed.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.625
-You let yourself get distracted.
-Lucy legged it in the middle of a job.

24:40.708 --> 24:42.833
But you'd never bollock her like this.

24:42.916 --> 24:46.333
And, by the way,
this mirror predates the Problem.

24:46.416 --> 24:49.958
Just think about that.
Let that blow your mind for one second.

24:50.041 --> 24:53.333
Who knows what it could tell us?
We should never have left it there.

24:53.416 --> 24:54.625
-What happened to you?

24:54.708 --> 24:56.875
-I told you to watch him.
-The skull.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.125
It was talking, just now.

24:59.208 --> 25:02.500
And not some random repeated death loop.
An actual conversation.

25:03.458 --> 25:04.291
With me.

25:05.708 --> 25:07.333
Is it talking to you now?

25:08.166 --> 25:12.125
No. No, no, look, right, I know
how this might sound, but it happened.

25:12.625 --> 25:16.583
I'm telling the truth. It used my name.
That's why I passed out yesterday.

25:16.666 --> 25:20.333
-Lucy, that's impossible.
-No, it's not. Marissa Fittes did it.

25:21.750 --> 25:26.000
Right, this valve, yeah? You turn it,
you twist it, then it lets its voice out.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.583
Come on, George. You have to believe me.

25:32.750 --> 25:35.250
It said you had something dangerous
hidden in that room.

25:35.333 --> 25:39.166
The secret one on the landing.
So? Is there?

25:39.833 --> 25:40.750
Because if there is,

25:40.833 --> 25:44.208
then it proves that we have a real
sentient Type Three on our hands

25:44.291 --> 25:45.875
-and that I am--
-Clinically insane.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.416
Really fucking powerful!

25:49.833 --> 25:51.166
That is not just a nick.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.083
You need to get that looked at.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.500
-Could be some toxins got into your blood.
-No! No!

25:55.583 --> 25:59.875
I am not poisoned or delusional
or going crazy. George, look at me!

26:01.333 --> 26:02.333
This is real!

26:04.375 --> 26:07.958
Lockwood, this is what happens when
you let people accessorize with sources.

26:08.041 --> 26:11.333
You gave her a free pass just 'cause
you like the way she looks at you.

26:11.416 --> 26:12.958
But <i>I'm </i>the one who's distracted.

26:13.041 --> 26:15.416
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yeah, sure.

26:19.333 --> 26:21.750
Lockwood, please, you have to believe me.

26:21.833 --> 26:24.083
-You're not Marissa Fittes.
-Why?

26:25.541 --> 26:28.750
'Cause you can't handle
being my Tom Rotwell? Second best?

26:31.958 --> 26:34.000
Oh my God. That is it, isn't it?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.375
'Cause you know that I am not lying.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.875
And I am right
about whatever is in that bloody room.

26:39.958 --> 26:42.291
You are talking about something
you do not understand.

26:42.375 --> 26:45.583
You can hear visitors
better than anyone I have ever met,

26:45.666 --> 26:47.041
but you cannot talk to them,

26:47.125 --> 26:50.875
and if you ever mention that room
ever again, you are done here.

27:26.541 --> 27:29.875
-<i>Before classification,</i>

27:29.958 --> 27:33.208
<i>an agent's work</i>
<i>was chaotic and unpredictable.</i>

27:33.291 --> 27:35.125
<i> Hmm, they were fighting</i>
<i>in the dark.</i>

27:35.625 --> 27:37.125
<i>There was no science to it.</i>

27:38.416 --> 27:42.791
<i>But once we began noticing patterns</i>
<i>of behavior, we began categorizing.</i>

27:43.458 --> 27:46.750
<i>The weakest visitors as Type Ones,</i>
<i>the stronger as Type Twos.</i>

27:48.208 --> 27:52.000
<i>You've spoken of a third, somewhat</i>
<i>controversial category of visitor,</i>

27:52.083 --> 27:53.208
<i>the Type Three.</i>

27:53.708 --> 27:58.250
<i>So rare that you're the only person</i>
<i>on record ever to have encountered one.</i>

28:00.375 --> 28:01.458
<i>What's your question?</i>

28:02.750 --> 28:05.916
<i>What would you say to the people</i>
<i>who don't believe Type Threes exist,</i>

28:06.000 --> 28:07.583
<i>that they're a myth?</i>

28:09.583 --> 28:13.041
<i>Denial is a very human reaction</i>
<i>when faced with new ideas.</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:15.166
<i>Especially such frightening ones.</i>

28:16.458 --> 28:20.500
<i>A Type Three is a visitor who defiantly</i>
<i>refuses to move on from the mortal realm.</i>

28:22.625 --> 28:25.916
<i>A spirit of extraordinary strength</i>
<i>and intelligence.</i>

28:27.416 --> 28:29.875
<i>It thinks, feels,</i>
<i>and speaks like you or I,</i>

28:30.375 --> 28:34.333
<i>but it does that alone</i>
<i>and in darkness for all eternity.</i>

28:35.458 --> 28:38.708
<i>Until it happens upon a living soul</i>
<i>with the talent to communicate.</i>

28:40.166 --> 28:43.750
<i>And, as far as we know,</i>
<i>I seem to be the only one.</i>

28:46.958 --> 28:47.791
Yeah?

28:54.791 --> 28:55.708
Hi.

28:57.708 --> 28:58.833
Uh…

28:58.916 --> 29:01.750
I know I look like Anthony Lockwood,
but I'm not.

29:02.583 --> 29:05.083
I'm actually a fully qualified doctor, so…

29:06.916 --> 29:07.750
Good.

29:08.583 --> 29:11.000
'Cause he was
a massive prick to me just now.

29:16.958 --> 29:17.958
Come on, then.

29:18.041 --> 29:18.958
Bring it in.

29:29.791 --> 29:31.375
Uh, I'm not sure what I should…

29:42.500 --> 29:43.833
This is gonna hurt.

29:44.958 --> 29:46.250
Thanks for the warning.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.041
I was…

29:52.208 --> 29:55.333
I was orphaned at the age of six.

29:56.750 --> 29:57.791
So, uh…

30:01.458 --> 30:04.750
all I can say is I don't really enjoy
talking about my past.

30:07.666 --> 30:09.666
And that's what's behind that door.

30:11.041 --> 30:11.916
Okay.

30:14.250 --> 30:15.666
And, uh…

30:17.000 --> 30:20.416
you used it to convince me that,

30:21.291 --> 30:26.041
not only are you one of only two people
in the history of the world

30:26.833 --> 30:28.916
to be able to talk to ghosts,

30:29.500 --> 30:34.250
but that we actually have
a Type Three ghost in our house.

30:34.333 --> 30:39.125
You know, two events
with one-in-a-billion probability.

30:40.916 --> 30:44.666
-And the chances of you being right are--
-I know.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.958
I wouldn't believe me either.

30:48.375 --> 30:51.541
That's… not the problem.

30:53.041 --> 30:57.750
The problem is, when you like
the spotlight as much as I do,

30:58.750 --> 31:05.500
it's quite an adjustment to realize
that the real reason you might be here

31:05.583 --> 31:07.500
is to shine it on somebody else.

31:14.166 --> 31:15.333
You believe me.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
I do.

31:19.250 --> 31:20.291
About everything.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.041
Thanks.

31:30.541 --> 31:32.666
You know I don't actually
want the spotlight, right?

31:33.916 --> 31:34.750
I know.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.166
It's maddening.

31:38.916 --> 31:42.500
I suppose it would make me, uh…
quite the asset, wouldn't it?

31:45.166 --> 31:47.083
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

31:50.750 --> 31:51.916
We'll go carefully.

31:53.833 --> 31:54.833
I promise.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.375
Uh, so, go on, then, what did it say?

32:09.458 --> 32:10.291
Yeah, um…

32:10.833 --> 32:14.583
Well, he… he, um…
he said he could smell power on me.

32:14.666 --> 32:18.375
He turned really nasty. Then he had
this really weird prophecy about death.

32:19.166 --> 32:22.166
-Prophecy of death?
-Yeah, I know, I know. Big deal, right?

32:22.958 --> 32:24.875
But he… he seemed really sure of it.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.041
We should probably tell George.

32:33.333 --> 32:34.250
George?

32:38.250 --> 32:39.583
I'm sorry about earlier.

32:41.791 --> 32:42.750
Can we talk?

32:48.041 --> 32:51.000
Lockwood, where is he? It's 2:00 a.m.

32:57.541 --> 32:58.750
We need to find him.

32:59.625 --> 33:00.458
Now.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.833
A crime scene. What the hell?

33:53.250 --> 33:54.375
-Karim.

33:58.333 --> 34:01.166
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I didn't do that.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.291
Whatever it was that someone did.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.583
You're in my crime scene.
And the mirror's been stolen.

34:06.666 --> 34:09.291
What? But this has only been
out of the ground a few hours.

34:09.916 --> 34:14.166
I hear you lot did the excavation.
Anything out of the ordinary?

34:15.125 --> 34:18.000
No. Absolutely by the book. Any suspects?

34:18.083 --> 34:19.125
Not yet.

34:20.083 --> 34:23.083
But they knocked out a 12-year-old
night watch kid to get in, so…

34:23.583 --> 34:25.041
they're definitely gonna pay for it.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.416
Why weren't we contacted?

34:27.500 --> 34:29.000
It's no longer your case.

34:30.083 --> 34:31.333
Put another team on it.

34:33.625 --> 34:37.083
Karim! We've just been hearing
about your excavation.

34:37.916 --> 34:41.583
Is Lockwood here? Or is he gonna
throw you under the bus for this?

34:42.083 --> 34:43.625
We're right here.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.125
-Ah!
-Good evening.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.916
-You all right, Kat?
-Good evening, Inspector.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.333
Anthony Lockwood
and a case gone wrong.

34:51.041 --> 34:52.666
-Nothing seems to change.

34:52.750 --> 34:56.125
Nice to see you here, Kipps.
What's that, third time this week?

34:56.208 --> 34:58.208
-Twice, by my count.
-The mirror's gone.

34:59.375 --> 35:03.000
-This is big.
-It is, yeah. And it's our case.

35:03.083 --> 35:06.416
Not anymore. We've already made
a preliminary report.

35:07.666 --> 35:11.541
The first question is, why an iron casket
a century before the Problem?

35:12.041 --> 35:15.750
Well, the Fittes database
confirms it to be a still,

35:15.833 --> 35:18.250
used in breweries
in the late 19th century.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.833
It also confirms
that 1886 saw a violent labor dispute

35:21.916 --> 35:24.041
at Hildrew's Ales at Kilburn.

35:24.875 --> 35:25.875
There you go, sir.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.958
We believe this well-dressed man
was the owner,

35:29.041 --> 35:32.416
murdered by his workers and buried
in the first thing they could find.

35:32.500 --> 35:35.375
-An accidentally murdered brewer?
-An awful way to die, sir.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.250
It would explain why he's unquiet.

35:38.958 --> 35:43.000
The mirror's clearly a personal item,
treasured enough to be his source.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.333
Unless Karim has a better answer?

35:49.208 --> 35:50.458
Yes, I do, actually.

35:51.458 --> 35:52.708
-You do?
-Yeah.

35:52.791 --> 35:54.250
You sure you do?

35:54.333 --> 35:55.708
I know who that man is.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.125
This better be good, Karim.

36:01.541 --> 36:05.458
Bobby, why would anyone
carry a cast-iron still for two miles

36:05.541 --> 36:07.500
just to have something to bury a body in?

36:08.416 --> 36:10.000
You do it because it's iron.

36:10.083 --> 36:13.125
You do it to guard against
the evil spirits you're trying to bury.

36:13.208 --> 36:17.208
Of course, we're talking a hundred years
before the Problem, so that's odd.

36:17.291 --> 36:20.625
But then there's the inscription
on the mirror. You saw that, right?

36:20.708 --> 36:23.708
We're working on it.
We've already hired an Aramaic translator.

36:24.833 --> 36:27.250
They'll be glad of the work,
but this is Phoenician.

36:27.333 --> 36:29.958
Very trendy
in Victorian occultist circles.

36:30.583 --> 36:34.416
-It means "The truth lies beyond."
-The slogan of the Open Arms Fellowship.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.750
And about six other ghost cults
over the decades,

36:36.833 --> 36:38.500
but this is the earliest use I've found.

36:38.583 --> 36:40.375
This death was no accident.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.916
We're looking at a wealthy occultist
way ahead of his time,

36:43.000 --> 36:44.875
executed and buried in secret

36:44.958 --> 36:48.125
with a mirror that will be worth a fortune
on the black market.

36:49.333 --> 36:52.083
So, is it our case?

36:52.166 --> 36:55.041
If you have a name. I'm undecided.

36:55.125 --> 36:56.291
What?

36:56.875 --> 37:00.041
Have you got anything on Dr. Edmund
Bickerstaff in that report, Bobby?

37:00.125 --> 37:01.958
His family used to own this cemetery.

37:02.041 --> 37:05.541
Edmund Bickerstaff? He's a joke.
Britain's most famous pervert.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.416
Mm-hm. Unless he wasn't.

37:07.916 --> 37:09.625
Unless that was the cover story

37:09.708 --> 37:11.791
for the real reason
he was creeping round graveyards.

37:11.875 --> 37:15.541
Doing what, I don't know, but the iron
coffin, the inscription on the mirror…

37:15.625 --> 37:18.041
-It's ghost-related.
-But you've got no proof.

37:19.375 --> 37:23.833
Bobby, just a hunch. Something
I read in a book, if you remember those.

37:24.583 --> 37:28.666
Wealthy Victorians often secretly
marked their belongings in case of theft.

37:29.166 --> 37:32.416
So, why don't you release that clasp
for me?

37:43.916 --> 37:45.458
Bickerstaff's crest.

37:46.916 --> 37:50.125
Thank you, Bobby.
You've been a wonderful assistant.

37:50.208 --> 37:52.791
The man in this casket
is Edmund Bickerstaff.

37:52.875 --> 37:54.541
-No, no, don't.
-A dodgy Victorian doctor.

37:54.625 --> 37:56.125
With secret links to the occult

37:56.208 --> 37:59.750
and a missing mirror that'll be worth
a fortune to some very ruthless people.

38:01.083 --> 38:03.583
Well, looks like the best team won.

38:03.666 --> 38:05.708
-Oh, shut it.
-This is our case, okay?

38:05.791 --> 38:08.166
-You wouldn't know anything.
-You shut it, Karim.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.541
-You thought it was a brewer--
-Shut up!

38:14.833 --> 38:18.041
I'm putting you both on the case.
Working together.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.041
-What?

38:19.125 --> 38:20.875
It's not gonna be a problem, is it?

38:24.083 --> 38:25.875
Not at all, Inspector.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.375
-No, Inspector.
-Good.

38:31.125 --> 38:34.250
Locate the missing relic.
Find out who's stolen it and why.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.916
I need you to share information,
back each other up,

38:37.000 --> 38:38.958
and get it done
before anyone else gets hurt.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.375
-Hurry up!

38:48.375 --> 38:50.208
-Let's go.
-Sorry. My fault.

38:51.250 --> 38:54.208
So, I'm guessing
Lockwood's decided to believe you, then?

38:54.291 --> 38:56.708
Maybe, yeah.
Yeah, I don't expect you to.

38:56.791 --> 38:58.458
Good. Shall we get hot dogs?

38:58.541 --> 39:01.000
George Casper Karim, you bloody genius.

39:01.083 --> 39:02.125
Is that an apology?

39:02.625 --> 39:05.708
Yes. I should never have overlooked
your razor-sharp focus.

39:06.208 --> 39:08.083
Though a lot of what I said still stands.

39:08.166 --> 39:11.250
This mirror is some kind of clue
to understanding the Problem.

39:11.333 --> 39:14.000
I can feel it. We have to get it back.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.916
We're not really
working with Fittes?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.791
Lockwood! What the hell was that?

39:19.791 --> 39:22.458
You stole our commission.
This case is way beyond you.

39:23.791 --> 39:27.333
You know it isn't, Kipps.
That eats you up, doesn't it?

39:27.416 --> 39:30.041
We do this job better than anyone.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.791
-You're irrelevant.
-Oh, for God's sake.

39:34.291 --> 39:37.375
Quill Kipps, the walking appendix.

39:38.041 --> 39:40.041
Someone really ought to cut you out.

39:40.875 --> 39:43.333
There is no way
I'm working with you on this.

39:43.416 --> 39:44.916
I hoped you'd say that.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.250
Shall we make things
a bit more interesting?

39:48.208 --> 39:49.750
A race to find the mirror.

39:50.458 --> 39:54.958
Loser has to take out an ad in <i>The Times</i>
to congratulate the winner.

39:55.041 --> 39:57.083
Oh. Full page?

39:58.333 --> 40:00.625
Grow up, Tony. Here are the terms.

40:01.458 --> 40:04.708
The loser quits
and never works in this industry again.

40:06.875 --> 40:10.416
London will be a lot safer
with three less amateurs stumbling around.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.250
Do we have a deal?

40:18.166 --> 40:21.583
What's the matter, Tony?
Scared you'll lose?

40:27.416 --> 40:28.875
Oh, you're kidding me.

40:30.708 --> 40:32.041
Enjoy your last case.

40:43.291 --> 40:44.958
What the hell is he doing?

40:49.416 --> 40:51.250
Whatever the hell he wants.
