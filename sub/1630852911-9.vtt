SETTING THE STAGE FOR WHAT
SHOULD BE AN EXCITING

40:23.116 --> 40:26.685
REGULAR SEASON OF BASEBALL.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

40:26.728 --> 40:28.774
[TV REPORT CONTINUES,
INDISTINCT]

40:38.697 --> 40:40.046
[VOICE OF MARCUS]
I'M THE HEALTHIEST AND HAPPIEST

40:40.089 --> 40:41.787
I'VE EVER BEEN,

40:41.830 --> 40:45.094
AND I DON'T HAVE TO CHEAT
WITH DRUGS TO FEEL THIS WAY.

40:54.408 --> 40:55.888
SIMONE: AUNTIE.

40:55.931 --> 40:57.106
NATHANIEL: DID YOU
GET OUR TEXT?

40:57.150 --> 40:59.108
I DID.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.459
SO WHAT'S THE BIG
NEWS YOU TWO HAD
TO RUSH OVER TO TELL ME?

41:01.502 --> 41:03.373
YOU DIDN'T SUBMIT YOUR
RESIGNATION YET, RIGHT?

41:03.417 --> 41:05.680
BECAUSE, QUIETLY,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THE ASS

41:05.724 --> 41:07.421
THAT POSTED YOUR
MUGSHOT ON YARD YAK.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.771
SIMONE: NATE FOUND THE STUDENT.
AMARA: WHO IS IT?

41:09.815 --> 41:11.425
SIMONE: SOME GIRL THAT WORKS
IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.601
SHE SAID A TRUSTEE,
THIS VERONICA SKINNER,

41:13.645 --> 41:15.255
CAME UP TO HER AFTER
A BOARD MEETING

41:15.298 --> 41:17.083
AND OFFERED HER $500

41:17.126 --> 41:19.302
TO CIRCULATE THE PHOTO
ANONYMOUSLY.

41:19.346 --> 41:20.956
VERONICA SKINNER.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.958
I DON'T KNOW ANY
BOARD MEMBER BY THAT NAME.

41:23.002 --> 41:25.483
SIMONE: WELL, SHE'S
THIS NEW APPOINTEE.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.269
SIMONE: THIS IS HER.

41:32.141 --> 41:33.665
WAIT.
DO YOU KNOW HER?

41:33.708 --> 41:35.493
JADA, MY CLASSMATE

41:35.536 --> 41:37.625
WHO BROKE INTO THE MEDICAL
FACILITY WITH ME,

41:37.669 --> 41:41.194
VERONICA IS HER SISTER.

41:41.237 --> 41:44.502
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN
ABOUT BASEBALL.

41:46.199 --> 41:47.853
THIS IS PERSONAL.

42:15.707 --> 42:16.969
GREG,
MOVE YOUR HEAD.
