00:58.349 --> 00:59.476
{\an8}Settle down.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.852
{\an8}Today we're going to be
watching a picture

01:00.935 --> 01:03.813
{\an8}that wasn't nominated
for any awards.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.063

01:05.147 --> 01:06.524
{\an8}But it should have been.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.635
even in the context
of a classroom.

01:33.718 --> 01:37.180
Maybe you should try to
sit next to Ian? Hmm?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.769
{\an7}And when this fine boy
was your age

01:42.852 --> 01:46.856
he was a student in my class.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.274
And now look!

01:48.358 --> 01:51.402
One of the most recognized
natural-healing doctors

01:51.486 --> 01:52.529
in the whole world.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.697
{\an8}Me and Hoodsey are
going to be, like

01:54.781 --> 01:56.199
{\an8}30 times that famous.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.367
For what, Carl?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.160
{\an1}I'm hardly good
at anything.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.495
Mrs. Gordon?

02:00.578 --> 02:02.497
Have you ever
taught a student

02:02.580 --> 02:05.208
whose adorable little
pet became famous?

02:05.291 --> 02:07.377
Because sometimes
if your pet's

02:07.460 --> 02:09.670
really, really
adorable and special

02:09.753 --> 02:11.047
it can get famous.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.131
{\an8}Forget it, Brandon.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.299
{\an8}Your stupid monkey

02:13.383 --> 02:14.717
{\an8}isn't ever going to
be famous for anything.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.969
{\an8}Except being stupid.

02:16.052 --> 02:19.931
You and Hoodsey are
already famous for that.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.392
Put your monkey
where your mouth is.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
{\an1}I'll bet you
me and Hoodsey

Winner takes the monkey.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.359
Carl! I've told you
a million times

02:31.442 --> 02:36.239
there will be no low-stakes
gambling in my classroom.

02:42.787 --> 02:43.705
Carl. Hoodsey.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.748
{\an1}Blake Gripling's

Psst.

Huh?

(<i> laughing...</i> )

03:08.396 --> 03:10.565
<i>Watch as it secretes</i>
<i>and secretes...</i>

03:10.648 --> 03:13.151
Hey, kids.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.779
The pituitary deserves
your silence and respect.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.031
Sorry, Mr. Cilia.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.532
We're really sorry.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.909
Check out Ginger
and Brace-face.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.870
They're practically
flirting!

03:23.953 --> 03:25.788
{\an1}You wish.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.167
{\an5}It certainly would
make things easier
for me and Ian.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.049
{\an1}Got History
on the south side

03:36.132 --> 03:38.343
and need to hit
the infirmary en route.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.637
Bye! Oh, don't forget
choir practice!

03:40.720 --> 03:42.305
Wait for you
in the band room!

03:42.388 --> 03:43.598
{\an1}Hey, your mom
picking you up today?

03:43.681 --> 03:45.475
{\an3}Nuh-uh.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.143
She's working,
I'm walking.

03:47.226 --> 03:48.102
All right, cool.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.520
Meet me at the bike rack.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.688
I'll ride you.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.150
I must say, Ginger.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.693
{\an1}You and your boyfriend
make a cute couple.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.861
And "cute"
isn't a word

03:56.945 --> 03:59.447
I'm generally
comfortable with.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.658
Darren? My boyfriend?

04:01.741 --> 04:03.076
(<i> laughs</i> )

04:03.159 --> 04:04.243
Are you crazy?

04:04.327 --> 04:05.662
We're, like, total pals.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.329
He's my neighbor.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.082
{\an1}I mean,
I've known him forever.

04:09.165 --> 04:12.961
{\an4}"Friends first" is
the foolproof formula
for relationship success.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.046
All the best couples
start out that way.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.839
At least, that's what
Dr. Fondfeelings says.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.257
I watch her infomercials.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.718
There you have it.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.638
And Dr. Fondfeelings
is never wrong.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.309
Never?

04:28.393 --> 04:31.312
Hoodsey:
It could happen.

04:31.396 --> 04:35.358
{\an5}And if we really are world
famous by the end of this
weekend, we win a monkey.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.485
And we can make it do
all kinds of crummy things.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.740
Wow. A NASA-quality
super-hi telescope!

04:42.824 --> 04:44.826
Oh, I've always wanted
one of these.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.786
{\an1}The monkey could eat
our vegetables.

04:46.869 --> 04:47.912
{\an1}We could train it
to clean our rooms.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.706
{\an1}I mean the
possibilities are...

04:49.789 --> 04:51.833
Infinite!

04:51.916 --> 04:54.168
Hoodsey, we can use
this telescope

04:54.252 --> 04:56.295
to discover something
really cool, like a comet.

04:56.379 --> 05:00.049
Then we name it after ourselves
and poof!

05:00.133 --> 05:01.676
We're world famous.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.053
Blake's never going
to let us, you know.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.138
{\an1}He has to.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.765
{\an1}Otherwise, we hold
his homework ransom.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.188
Cheerio, old bean.

05:14.272 --> 05:18.026
I'd hoped to snag
a word with Master Blake.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.068
Is he about?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.529
(<i> tearfully</i> ):
Terribly sorry.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.490
I'm afraid... (<i> sniffles</i> )
he's not in.

05:24.574 --> 05:29.454
{\an5}He's fallen ill and remains
hospitalized at this very
moment.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.747
{\an1}(<i> crying</i> )

05:30.830 --> 05:31.706
Is he okay?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.082
I mean, what happened?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.251
It's his blasted tonsils.

05:35.334 --> 05:39.005
They've plagued him
e'er since he was a tiny tot.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.424
(<i> blows nose loudly</i> )

05:41.507 --> 05:42.550
Relax, Winston.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.594
Tonsillectomy
is no biggie.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.304
Carl's mom is a nurse.

05:46.387 --> 05:46.596
He knows.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.681
Truly?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.892
Then I feel scads better.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.310
Thanks so much.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.771
Why don't the two
of you blokes pop by

05:54.854 --> 05:56.773
and pay him a visit
at hospital?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.483
He'll be there
a few more days.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.901
Perfect!

05:59.984 --> 06:00.568
Here, Winston.

06:00.651 --> 06:03.112
Give Blake his
homework for us.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.615
{\an1}Why'd you give up
his homework, Carl?

06:05.698 --> 06:07.784
Now we got nothing on him.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.951
Hey...!

06:09.035 --> 06:12.371
{\an4}Hoodsey, with Blake
and his whole family
at the hospital

06:12.455 --> 06:14.290
{\an1}we don't need to
resort to blackmail.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.292
{\an1}We can simply borrow
his telescope for the weekend

06:16.375 --> 06:19.879
{\an1}then return it before
he ever knows it's gone.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.798
That's a total violation
of the New Toy Code.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.965
What "New Toy Code"?

06:23.049 --> 06:25.468
And I quote,
"No decent human

06:25.551 --> 06:27.387
"shall play with
another man's toy

06:27.470 --> 06:29.055
"until the new toy
recipient

06:29.138 --> 06:30.932
"has had the opportunity
to play with it himself.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.975
Especially
without asking."

06:33.059 --> 06:36.145
You wrote it,
circa second grade.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.564
{\an1}(<i> scoffs</i> )
It's totally archaic.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.274
No, Carl,
it's totally fair

06:40.358 --> 06:42.693
and I, for one,
intend to uphold it.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.822
{\an5}We have to get
Blake's consent,
and you know it.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.032
(<i> grumbles</i> )

06:49.158 --> 06:50.993
Grab my bag?

06:52.078 --> 06:54.956
Your chariot, madame.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.000
Not too fast, okay?

06:58.084 --> 06:58.709
Okay.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.044
So you're never
going to guess

07:00.128 --> 07:03.172
what Miranda said
about us today.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.465
It's really funny.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.925
What did she say?

07:06.008 --> 07:08.845
{\an1}Ian? What are you
doing here?

07:08.928 --> 07:09.846

Nah...

07:54.974 --> 07:56.058
Out!

07:56.142 --> 07:57.226
You were twitching

07:57.310 --> 07:59.061
{\an1}and you drooled
on your notebook.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.771
{\an1}That's always

inside the tooth?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.315
Yeah. Kinda.

Well, Miranda sort of
held the tooth open

{\an1}You have to want to
do this work.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.669
{\an4}Now unless you're
ready to cooperate,
I really can't...

09:46.752 --> 09:48.796
{\an5}It says here:
"The details
of the dream

09:48.879 --> 09:49.964
"aren't always
important.

09:50.047 --> 09:50.756
"What's more telling

09:50.840 --> 09:53.551
is the overall mood
of the dream."

09:53.634 --> 09:53.884
{\an1}Really?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.428
{\an3}Uh-huh.

09:55.511 --> 09:59.056
So, after you flew
into Darren's tooth

09:59.140 --> 10:02.560
how did you feel?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.354
I felt... happy.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.522
{\an1}Happy?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.522
Happy?

10:06.605 --> 10:11.068
Oh...! Ginger has the
total hots for Darren!

10:11.152 --> 10:13.029
I always knew something
like this would happen.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.989
I swear I did.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.157
Dr. Fondfeelings says

10:16.240 --> 10:17.700
all the most
successful couples

10:17.783 --> 10:19.201
start out as friends first.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.953
Dr. Fondfeelings.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.040
Love to know where she studied.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.047
(<i> loud slurping...</i> )

10:31.130 --> 10:34.717
"Dear Blake..."

10:34.800 --> 10:38.179
{\an5}"Some don't know
what they got
until it's gone.

10:38.262 --> 10:41.599
and me and Carl found
out a little too late."

10:41.682 --> 10:42.933
Are you nuts?

10:43.017 --> 10:44.393
It's from a song, Carl.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.728
A really good song.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.898
{\an5}The kind of song
that makes certain
kids cry, okay?

10:48.981 --> 10:51.067
{\an1}Hoodsey, we're trying
to write a get-well card

10:51.150 --> 10:53.652
not a love letter!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.029
Ooh, a love letter.

10:55.112 --> 10:55.821
Did you hear that, boys?

10:57.656 --> 10:58.783
Retreat, Terrence!

11:00.743 --> 11:01.786
{\an1}(<i> gulps</i> )

11:05.456 --> 11:07.875
{\an1}Our visit with Blake
means everything, Hoods.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.126
Without his telescope

11:09.210 --> 11:11.754
{\an1}we could get shown up
by a monkey, do you copy?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.339
Oh, loud and clear,
Carl.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.092
{\an5}I don't want that
to happen any more
than you do. Honest.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.928
I know you don't, Hoods.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.721
Now let's try it again.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.808
"Dear Blake..."

11:30.189 --> 11:32.358
{\an1}Do you think he's
going to sit with us?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.901
I don't see why not.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.569
He does every other day.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.154
How does my hair look?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.948
Orange, same as always.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.116
Macie!

11:40.199 --> 11:42.201
What is with you?

11:42.284 --> 11:42.952
It's just that

11:43.035 --> 11:45.955
{\an1}once Ginger and Darren
become an item

11:46.038 --> 11:48.624
{\an1}nothing is ever going
to be the same.

11:48.707 --> 11:49.959
That's not true.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.795
If anything did happen
between me and Darren

11:52.878 --> 11:55.214
us four would still be
tight as ever.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.799
Right, Dodie?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.134
Um...

11:59.885 --> 12:01.804
Dodie?

12:01.887 --> 12:05.141
Oh, you guys... come on.

12:05.224 --> 12:05.766
Hey, where we going?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.566
Uh... hello?

12:13.649 --> 12:14.483
What's everyone
smiling about?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.987
{\an1}Uh, just discussing
how krauterrific

12:18.070 --> 12:18.988
{\an1}yesterday's
chili dogs were.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.906
{\an3}Okay...

12:20.990 --> 12:22.408
Well, I've got
an even hotter

12:22.491 --> 12:23.325
topic to discuss:
Harley James.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.661
His new movie
is opening up

12:25.744 --> 12:26.787
at the Flickaramaplex
this weekend.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.498
{\an5}It just so happens
that Will is working
at the 'plex.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.835
And he can get us four
tickets to the matinee

12:32.918 --> 12:34.420
no waiting in line
or anything.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.631
All four of us, huh?

12:37.715 --> 12:38.174
(<i> giggles</i> )

12:38.257 --> 12:39.967
Sounds terrif.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.178
"Terrif"?

12:42.261 --> 12:43.345
You guys
are acting weird.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.139
I'm going back
for more corn.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.767
Save your seat, D., okay?

12:50.644 --> 12:54.440
Why am I suddenly acting
like such a spaz?

12:54.523 --> 12:56.108
{\an3}Hey.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.694
So, you ladies

12:58.777 --> 13:00.362
into Harley James?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.198
What? Oh, uh,
yeah, we are.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.408
See you at the matinee
this weekend, right?

13:04.492 --> 13:05.993
No doubt.

13:06.076 --> 13:06.535
Matinees rock.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.205
Yeah, I know. Okay, bye.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.708
Did you see that?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.877
Ginger practically
snubbed Ian Richton.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.506
{\an1}What do you want to bet
she's dwelling on Metal Man?

13:18.589 --> 13:19.715
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

13:19.798 --> 13:21.509
Foutley is so pliable.

13:21.592 --> 13:25.471
And Ian Richton
will so belong to me.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.474
But he invited
all three of us.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.852
It's not even
an official date.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.146
Still, if it was
an official date

13:34.230 --> 13:36.774
{\an1}and our presence
officially ruined it?

13:36.857 --> 13:38.859
{\an1}We could never
forgive ourselves.

13:38.943 --> 13:39.235
Officially.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.237
(<i> sighs</i> )

13:41.320 --> 13:42.780
{\an1}Seems like
just yesterday

13:42.863 --> 13:44.698
{\an1}we were a squadron
of sorts.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.201
It <i> was</i> just yesterday.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.661
We should get going.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.455
Don't get up,
we'll show ourselves out.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.249
If you feel like calling

13:53.332 --> 13:56.252
to tell me what happened
when it's all over

13:56.335 --> 13:57.711
I'll be home.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.837
Man!

14:04.176 --> 14:06.095
{\an1}Now, when you're done
visiting Blake

14:06.178 --> 14:09.306
{\an5}park yourselves
in the Nurses Lounge
and wait for me.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.766
Affirmative, Momster.

14:10.849 --> 14:11.934
And, uh, thanks.

14:12.017 --> 14:12.560
{\an1}Okay, page me
if you need me.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.728
{\an1}But not
unless you need me.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.355
{\an1}And no monkey business,
you two.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.273
When we get in there

14:17.356 --> 14:19.900
make sure you seem
really sorry for Blake.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.819
If you can manage
to cry a little

14:21.902 --> 14:23.112
it probably wouldn't be
a bad idea.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.072
Okay, Carl...

14:25.155 --> 14:26.699
but what if he
still says no?

14:26.782 --> 14:28.993
We have an advantage
here, Hoodsey.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.286
Blake can barely talk.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.579
Remember that.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.211
Hi, Darren...

14:39.295 --> 14:40.254
{\an1}Darren:
Hi.

14:40.337 --> 14:40.879
Aah!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.840
{\an1}Hey, what's
with the skirt?

14:42.923 --> 14:45.551
Oh... my pants
were all dirty.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.011
Oh. Bummer.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.429
So I guess you don't
want to ride bikes

14:48.512 --> 14:50.431
to the theater, then.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.557
Well, let's bolt.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.642
We can catch
the bus or something.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.476
Uh, where's
Dodie and Macie?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.979
Oh, they couldn't make it.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.397
It's just going to be us.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.690
Hope you don't mind.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.233
Why would I mind?

15:01.317 --> 15:05.988
{\an1}That is so sweet,
you big... sweetie.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.115
Are you... feeling okay?

15:10.909 --> 15:12.995
Blake? Can you hear me?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.997
He looks so peaceful.

15:15.080 --> 15:15.831
Let's not...

15:15.914 --> 15:18.000
Here, let me put those
in water for you.

15:23.922 --> 15:24.548
So very thoughtful of you.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.425
Dreadfully sorry
Blake's napping.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.259
I'll tell him you...

15:27.343 --> 15:28.844
Come on, Blake!

15:28.927 --> 15:30.179
Up and at 'em!

15:30.262 --> 15:31.847
Hey! Hi there!

15:31.930 --> 15:32.348
(<i> groans</i> )

15:32.431 --> 15:34.642
There's our Blake!

15:34.725 --> 15:36.352
Good morning, friend!

15:36.435 --> 15:36.977
Hello there! Hi!

15:40.439 --> 15:42.191
(<i> hoarsely</i> ):
Oh... Car...

15:42.274 --> 15:44.318
{\an1}Shh...
don't say anything.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.195
You need your strength.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.948
So they took out
your tonsils, huh?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.075
{\an1}Uh-huh...

15:51.158 --> 15:52.701
You need to borrow a Mason jar?

15:52.785 --> 15:53.285
You know, to keep them in?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.244
Oh...

15:54.328 --> 15:56.163
Blake?

15:56.246 --> 15:57.873
You did keep them, didn't you?

15:57.956 --> 15:58.791
Uh-uh...

15:58.874 --> 16:00.542
So you mean
they're lying

16:00.626 --> 16:02.795
in a pile of
trash somewhere?

16:02.878 --> 16:03.754
Creepy.

16:03.837 --> 16:04.922
Don't worry.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.131
My mom works here.

16:06.215 --> 16:06.882
I'll pull some strings.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.718
See if we can get 'em
back for you.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.887
That sure is
nice of you, Carl.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.056
Why, it seems
like you would do

16:14.139 --> 16:16.100
just about anything
for Blake.

16:16.183 --> 16:19.269
Well, we should
probably get going.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.938
You need your rest.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.106
Bless you, son.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.775
Oh, say, I almost forgot.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.861
You don't suppose
Hoodsey and I could borrow

16:27.945 --> 16:30.406
your new high-powered telescope
this weekend?

16:30.489 --> 16:32.032
We have a big
science project due

16:32.116 --> 16:33.534
and what with you
in the hospital and all...

16:33.617 --> 16:37.079
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

16:37.162 --> 16:39.081
No... no... no...

16:39.164 --> 16:40.457
A million times no, I say!

16:40.541 --> 16:43.419
Absolutely not!

16:43.502 --> 16:47.172
(<i> coughs, groans</i> )

16:48.424 --> 16:51.635
(<i> grumbles</i> )

16:51.719 --> 16:54.555
{\an5}Hoodsey:
Did you see
all that ice cream?

16:54.638 --> 16:56.765
I mean, the kid can't even
use the stupid telescope.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.809
{\an1}It's just sitting around
in a box!

16:58.892 --> 17:00.769
I really don't see
how a boy his size

17:00.853 --> 17:03.647
could possibly eat
all that ice cream.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.357
Oh, he's intolerable!

17:05.441 --> 17:06.900
Come on, Carl,
let's go unwind

17:06.983 --> 17:08.109
in the Nurses Lounge.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.111
They probably have

17:09.194 --> 17:10.194
{\an1}a vending machine
and everything.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.041
Carl:
Holy larynx!

17:24.126 --> 17:25.627
People parts!

17:25.711 --> 17:26.211
In jars!

17:36.513 --> 17:38.015
(<i> laughs</i> )

17:41.185 --> 17:42.227
{\an3}Come on!

17:42.311 --> 17:43.520
(<i> crowd muttering</i> )

17:43.604 --> 17:45.689
Okay, let's
hear it.

17:45.773 --> 17:46.899
Who's number one?

17:46.982 --> 17:48.442
Who's the best brother?

17:48.525 --> 17:49.526
You are, Will.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.277
Who rules?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.488
Who rocks the house
on a regular?

17:52.571 --> 17:53.655
Both:
You do, Will.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.908
{\an1}You know, we're
going to miss previews.

17:55.991 --> 17:56.992
(<i> laughs</i> )

17:57.076 --> 17:59.119
{\an1}I can't believe
he's your brother.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.829
Neither can I.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.997
Hey, check it out.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.332
{\an1}Two extras, since
Dodie and Macie bailed.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.459
Lucky you.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.418
Everyone else got sold out.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.670
{\an1}Want 'em?

18:08.754 --> 18:11.381
You mean I can just...
have them?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.509
{\an1}Yeah. Me and Ginger
don't need four seats.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.885
Good deal.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.387
I know just
who to invite.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.972
(<i> laughs</i> )

18:25.312 --> 18:28.524
Since you got the tickets,
I'll get the refreshments.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.192
{\an1}I'm a modern woman,
Darren.

18:30.275 --> 18:30.901
Can we get
a large corn?

18:30.984 --> 18:33.987
Ginger, what do
you want to drink?

18:34.071 --> 18:35.197
Pink lemonade.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.783
One straw or two?

18:37.866 --> 18:38.158
One!

18:37.866 --> 18:38.158
Two!

18:40.118 --> 18:41.495
{\an1}Miranda:
Oh, Ginger?

18:41.578 --> 18:43.705
If you're heading
into the theater

18:43.789 --> 18:46.166
would you mind saving
me and Ian seats?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.168
Then we could
all sit together.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.754
It'll be fun--
kind of like a double date.

18:50.838 --> 18:54.258
You mean you and Ian...?

18:54.341 --> 18:57.261
Just <i> one</i> straw please.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.270
{\an1}So this is where
all the extra body parts go.

19:06.353 --> 19:10.065
It's the most magical
place in the world!

19:12.484 --> 19:14.027
Carl?

19:14.111 --> 19:19.116
{\an5}You're not
going to believe
what I just found.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.205
(<i> audience talking...</i> )

19:28.667 --> 19:29.710
Just so you know?

19:29.793 --> 19:31.587
When a movie's
really scary?

19:31.670 --> 19:32.546
Sometimes if you...

19:32.629 --> 19:37.134
{\an1}hold hands with the person
you're sitting next to

19:37.217 --> 19:39.177
{\an7}██

19:37.217 --> 19:39.177
it makes it less scary.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.554
Says who?

19:40.637 --> 19:41.930
(<i> movie music begins</i> )

19:47.769 --> 19:50.230
You're leaving this
dreadful place tomorrow, sir.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
And I, for one,
couldn't be happier.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.109
{\an1}Carl:
Oh, Blake?

19:54.192 --> 19:56.904
{\an1}No hard feelings
about the telescope, okay?

19:56.987 --> 19:59.072
{\an1}Hoodsey and I found
an excellent

19:59.156 --> 20:01.116
consolation prize.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.868
My, my...

20:02.951 --> 20:04.119
Yup. Your tonsils.

20:04.202 --> 20:07.456
{\an1}And if you want to
discuss visitation rights

20:07.539 --> 20:09.458
{\an1}feel free
to give us a call.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.543
When you get your voice back,
that is.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.420
(<i> both laughing</i> )

20:13.503 --> 20:14.254
My, my, my...

20:18.592 --> 20:20.093
{\an1}(<i> yells</i> )

20:20.177 --> 20:21.678
Aah!

20:24.348 --> 20:25.557
Sorry, baby.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.017
Gotta roll.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.688
Sorry, Darren.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.899
(<i> gasping</i> )

20:33.982 --> 20:35.567
She's a goner...

20:37.736 --> 20:39.237
Sorry, Ian.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.906
Vampires rock!

20:41.740 --> 20:43.325
(<i> all gasp</i> )

20:43.408 --> 20:44.576
This is getting

20:44.660 --> 20:46.662
really scary.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.705
(<i> grunting</i> )

20:48.789 --> 20:49.831
{\an1}Ha! Ha!

20:49.915 --> 20:52.709
Not so fast... Harley.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.838
This is the perfect time to...

20:57.714 --> 20:59.174
(<i> gasps</i> )

20:59.257 --> 21:01.343
{\an1}Ginger! What exactly
do you think you're doing?

21:03.178 --> 21:04.513
I don't know.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.557
It must be my...
pituitary gland!

21:09.351 --> 21:10.394
Ginger, wait!

21:12.938 --> 21:17.442
{\an1}What is going on
with you?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.569
I'm sorry, I...

21:19.653 --> 21:20.529
I guess we need to talk.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.991
It's like this.

21:24.074 --> 21:27.786
I had this really
confusing dream.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.705
{\an1}About you.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.539
Are you serious?

21:30.622 --> 21:32.040
Yeah.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.877
And it kind of made me
wonder if...

21:35.961 --> 21:38.880
maybe we were more
than just friends.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.550
{\an5}You mean...

21:38.964 --> 21:41.550
Yeah.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.801
{\an5}You and me?

21:41.633 --> 21:42.801
Right.

21:42.884 --> 21:43.552
Boyfriend and...

21:43.635 --> 21:44.845
Correct, Darren.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.013
Yeah.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.724
So that's why you were
acting so strange.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.601
{\an1}With the skirt and
the giggles and everything.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.729
Boy, you're not making
this easy, are you?

21:53.812 --> 21:57.607
Okay. Let me think.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.485
See, to me, we're
definitely more than

22:00.569 --> 22:01.903
"just friends."

22:01.987 --> 22:03.363
We're, like,
best friends.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.533
{\an1}I don't know... you're
like family to me, Ginger.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.164
I feel that way, too.

22:12.247 --> 22:12.998
But people
keep insisting

22:13.081 --> 22:16.043
that we make
this great couple.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.252
{\an1}(<i> sighs</i> )

22:17.336 --> 22:17.669
{\an1}People...

22:17.753 --> 22:19.629
(<i> laughing</i> )

22:19.713 --> 22:21.465
Oh, Darren...

22:21.548 --> 22:23.967
Besides, the world
might actually stop spinning

22:24.051 --> 22:26.136
if you gave up
on Ian Richton.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.930
{\an1}Now, wait, was it
my imagination

22:29.014 --> 22:31.099
or were you holding
his hand in there?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.268
(<i> laughing</i> )

22:33.351 --> 22:35.479
(<i> crickets chirping, owl hoots</i> )

22:35.562 --> 22:38.106
Better than a monkey?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.526
No question.

22:41.610 --> 22:45.280
(<i> both laughing</i> )

22:45.363 --> 22:46.615
Hoodsey:
I'll say!
