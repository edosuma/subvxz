WEBVTT

01:00.799 --> 01:02.975
Okay. Yep.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.368
That's nice.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.369
Wind machine?

01:05.500 --> 01:06.631
Give me more.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.111
Yes.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.504
Yes. That's it.

01:09.634 --> 01:10.766
Uh...

01:10.896 --> 01:12.855
More dirt on
the chest, please.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.118
Perfect. Thank you.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.468
You ever read any of
these romance novels?

01:17.599 --> 01:19.209
Honestly, not my thing, Josh.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.993
But apparently they sell

01:21.124 --> 01:23.735
because the ladies
love your hot body.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.215
Now, come on!
Pump up those pecs.

01:26.912 --> 01:27.696
Nice!

01:27.826 --> 01:29.045
Now gimme some attitude.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.440
I love it.
There it is.

01:32.570 --> 01:33.267
You know, you should
really read this one.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.442
It's pretty good.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.052
You read romance books?

01:36.183 --> 01:38.098
I gotta get into character.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.838
Come on.
You're a total pro.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.145
Honestly, I'm just
not the romantic type.

01:42.276 --> 01:43.886
Sure you are.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.062
You're always hoping romance
is around the corner.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.238
We live in hope.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.631
Now. Come on.

01:49.761 --> 01:50.980
Gimme some more of that
Viking pillage and plunder.

01:51.111 --> 01:51.894
I live to loot!

01:52.024 --> 01:52.982
Yes. Okay.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.288
Gimme the
looting look again.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.898
Yes, there it is.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.911
Okay.
Perfect.

02:55.653 --> 02:56.524
Oh.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.657
Okay. Get in there.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.094
All right. Ready?

03:02.225 --> 03:03.487
Big smiles.

03:03.618 --> 03:04.532
Perfect. Thank you.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.099
What's going on?

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
The covers. They really
do sell these books.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.582
There is nothing like
a good Viking romance

03:11.713 --> 03:12.931
for summer reading.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.458
I never meet any
guys like that.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.547
What? Your last two
dates had long hair.

03:19.677 --> 03:20.722
Well, I don't think long hair

03:20.852 --> 03:22.767
necessarily means handsome, Sam.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.943
Just means they're not bald.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.424
I could never
date a bald guy.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.861
Wait till you're over 50.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.211
He may be good looking.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.648
But is he boyfriend material?

03:33.778 --> 03:35.606
He's a little two dimensional.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.696
But I do love a man in uniform.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.701
Found Books. Tammy speaking.

03:43.832 --> 03:44.702
Yeah, she's here.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.705
Hello?
Samantha Hill speaking.

03:47.836 --> 03:48.924
Samantha.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.491
It's Lauren Lawrence here.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.796
Oh, hello.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.320
Long time no speak.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.886
Yeah. I think the
last time I saw you,

03:55.017 --> 03:56.888
you still had braces.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.543
Well, I'm all grown up now
and running my own bookstore.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.763
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.678
My father and I are
acting for the estate

04:03.808 --> 04:05.767
of the late Robert MacGraw.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.943
He had an extensive
book collection.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.728
We'd like you to go and value
it with a view to purchase.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.382
Sure. We can do that.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.079
We usually buy
books by the yard.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.386
We sort them into colors
and then we resell them.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.648
Content is irrelevant.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.041
Price depends on condition.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.999
And then we recycle the
ones that we can't use.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.827
He had some great
leather-bound books.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.351
Oh, those are
even harder to sell.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.918
Except for people who want
an instant antique library.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.790
We just want the
place cleaned out.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.139
Well, we
charge a fee for that,

04:30.270 --> 04:33.577
which we deduct from
the value of the books.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.013
Fine.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.885
How soon can you get there?

04:37.015 --> 04:38.190
We're a little busy right now.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.844
But by the end of
the week, for sure.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.977
When you get there
park in the back.

04:42.107 --> 04:46.242
The lockbox code on
the front door is 1234.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.592
Do you think you
can remember that?

04:48.723 --> 04:50.377
I will try.

04:50.507 --> 04:51.639
Okay. Bye now.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.469
You never did
like her. Did you?

04:55.599 --> 04:56.948
Nope.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.559
Since high school,
we moved in different circles

04:58.689 --> 05:00.778
and I haven't had to deal
with her, fortunately.

05:00.909 --> 05:03.825
But business is business.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.653
Well, Mr. MacGraw
did buy a lotta books

05:05.783 --> 05:06.871
from us over the years.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.004
His library could
be a real gold mine.

05:09.134 --> 05:10.919
Oh, let's hope.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.573
It's worth checking out.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.804
Just so you know, Mr. MacGraw
was a very wealthy man

05:26.935 --> 05:28.632
and he was a pillar
of our community,

05:28.763 --> 05:29.503
but he kept to himself.

05:30.634 --> 05:31.853
Beautiful old house.

05:31.983 --> 05:32.941
Wow!

05:45.954 --> 05:46.781
Wonder who'll
inherit all of this.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.260
Not sure.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.610
I don't really know too
much about the family.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.701
Hey, there's supposed to be
a keypad around here somewhere.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.009
Ah.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.054
1234.

06:00.751 --> 06:01.535
How original.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.372
I could live here.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.461
I'd for sure need
a new wardrobe.

06:14.591 --> 06:15.549
Okay. I'm gonna get started.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.724
And I'll get the boxes.

06:16.854 --> 06:17.942
Perfect. Just make
sure that you hit the

06:18.073 --> 06:19.117
home key lock button
on your way back in.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.684
- Got it.
- Thanks.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.092
Wow.

06:52.063 --> 06:52.934
Oh.

06:56.677 --> 06:57.634
Okay.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.984
100 yards at say
30 bucks a yard.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.290
3,000 bucks.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.596
What are we looking to offer?

07:02.726 --> 07:03.945
1,000 to start.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.773
And if they want more,
we'll settle for 1,500.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.688
But then we have to deduct
our cleaning out rate fee.

07:07.818 --> 07:08.950
Perfect.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.778
Okay. So let's start
sorting these books.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.435
Oh wow.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.524
There's a lot of old books here.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.221
There's some
modern novels too.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.005
Some really nice
coffee table books.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.703
Can make a few
dollars on those.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.052
There's a lot of
trashy paper backs.

07:24.182 --> 07:25.662
So we're probably just
gonna recycle those ones.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.708
I like trashy paper backs.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.013
Of course you do.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.014
Go get 'em.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.892
There's dozens of
them in good condition.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.328
Some are brand new.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.590
They might sell.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.070
It's summer.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.769
People love a hot, sexy,
steamy, trashy romance.

07:45.900 --> 07:46.944
You're probably right.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.468
Okay. Let's start
packing those too.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.428
Aw! A poesy of dried violets.

07:52.559 --> 07:53.821
How romantic!

07:53.951 --> 07:54.952
That is cute.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.476
Ooh. If we find any valuables,

07:56.606 --> 07:57.999
let's just put them
on the side here.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.093
What's that?

08:05.223 --> 08:06.137
It's an old house.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.878
They make noises.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.054
Or the ghost just woke up.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.621
Ooh!

08:11.752 --> 08:13.014
I'm just joking.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.148
Well, hello, handsome.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.889
I think we've met before.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.848
He is dangerously good looking.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.546
He's not bad.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.766
Some of
these covers too.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.071
This one's a few years old.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.638
The Viking must be
at the modeling game

08:28.769 --> 08:29.900
for a really long time.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.641
Not exactly the sort
of reading you'd expect

08:31.772 --> 08:32.860
for an old guy.

08:32.990 --> 08:33.817
Yeah. It is kinda weird, huh?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.649
Okay. It's okay.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.303
Let's go see what's-

08:41.433 --> 08:42.696
what's going on.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.204
Call the cops.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.686
911,
what's your emergency?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.514
Somebody has broken in
and is in the house.

09:18.645 --> 09:22.823
MacGraw Mansion.
Door code is 1234.

09:22.953 --> 09:23.650
We're dispatching
somebody right now.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.652
Okay. Understood.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.131
Okay.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.393
Follow me.

09:42.712 --> 09:43.539
Let's try to find a back way.

09:43.670 --> 09:44.584
Okay.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.034
Sam! Sam!

10:00.164 --> 10:01.731
Come on.

10:01.862 --> 10:02.776
Yeah. Right.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.091
He saw us!

10:21.621 --> 10:22.970
I think he's right behind us.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.495
Let's get outta here.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.498
Hey!

10:29.629 --> 10:30.586
Hey!

10:30.717 --> 10:31.413
Hey!

10:31.543 --> 10:32.501
Stand back.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.854
Freeze!

10:37.985 --> 10:39.943
Drop your weapon.

10:40.074 --> 10:40.814
It's a letter opener.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.642
Yeah, well. Drop it.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.382
He's a thief.

10:44.513 --> 10:45.645
I'm not a thief.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.298
Then who are you?
And what do you want?

10:47.429 --> 10:49.779
Drop the, the, this...

10:49.910 --> 10:51.302
The fireplace poker?

10:51.433 --> 10:53.478
Yes, Ms. Hill, drop the poker.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.918
I was just about to ask
Ms. Hill the same thing.

10:58.048 --> 10:58.962
Ask me what?

10:59.093 --> 11:00.355
I'll ask the questions.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.009
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

11:02.139 --> 11:03.706
I'm here at the request
of the estate lawyer

11:03.837 --> 11:04.968
to remove the library. Okay?

11:05.099 --> 11:07.797
Ms. Lawrence
didn't mention that.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.190
Well, I thought
you were thieves.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.626
Obviously we're not.

11:10.757 --> 11:11.932
That's why we
called the police.

11:12.062 --> 11:12.976
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.151
What are you doing here?

11:14.282 --> 11:16.632
I'll ask the questions!

11:16.763 --> 11:17.764
What are you doing here?

11:17.894 --> 11:19.374
I'm the owner.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.202
I thought the owner was dead.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.594
He was my grandfather.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.640
Good story. If it's true.

11:24.771 --> 11:25.859
Do you have any ID?

11:34.824 --> 11:36.217
I inherited the house.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.221
You hardly look the type to
inherit the MacGraw Mansion.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.918
Mr. MacGraw was a wealthy man.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.572
What's that supposed to mean?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.052
Well, you were crawling
through that window.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.358
I couldn't remember
the code to the lockbox.

11:47.489 --> 11:48.620
And I'm looking for something.

11:48.751 --> 11:49.709
You forgot 1234?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.452
You can't remember 1234?

11:54.583 --> 11:56.541
Wait, the code was 1234?

11:56.672 --> 11:57.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:57.673 --> 11:58.543
This is all confusing.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.762
You're confusing him.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.416
Look, you had to call the cops?

12:01.546 --> 12:03.331
She was right to call me, sir.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.941
Even if it is confusing.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.510
Please remove the glasses, sir.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.605
Okay. You check out.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.215
No more confusion.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.260
Mr. Joshua MacGraw.

12:21.653 --> 12:22.567
Satisfied?

12:23.699 --> 12:27.007
I'm sorry, Mr. MacGraw.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.749
There's a pill for that.

12:29.879 --> 12:30.662
If there's nothing else, folks,

12:30.793 --> 12:31.751
I'll be on my way.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.448
Okay. Thanks, Billy.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.975
Well, that was fun.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.108
If you'll excuse me,
I have a lot to do.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.330
That was intense.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.419
Yeah. What a jerk.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.769
All right. Well, let's get
this library packed up.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.752
I wonder
what he's looking for.

13:16.883 --> 13:17.753
I hope it's a happy pill.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.870
Okay, Grandpa,

13:48.001 --> 13:49.741
where would you hide
something so important?

13:56.966 --> 13:59.839
Hey, I was just gonna ask
if you wanted to lock up?

13:59.969 --> 14:00.883
No, I'm leaving.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.192
Should I take a look at
these in case I want a book?

14:05.322 --> 14:06.976
Well, you'll have to
come to my bookstore

14:07.107 --> 14:09.239
since I've officially
taken over the library.

14:09.370 --> 14:12.155
Once the books have been
unpacked, racked, and stacked,

14:12.286 --> 14:13.853
anyone can buy them so...

14:15.115 --> 14:16.029
Right.

14:17.726 --> 14:18.727
Need a hand?

14:18.858 --> 14:19.728
No, I'm good.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.296
Okay.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.732
Have a good night, Ms. Hill.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.258
Have a good night, Ms. Hill.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.966
Thanks, Britt.
It was a good day's work.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.358
Yeah. Except for Mr. Grumpy.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.707
Yeah, he was fun.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.318
Did he look familiar to you?

14:44.448 --> 14:46.233
Nope. And I hope to
never see him again.

14:52.369 --> 14:53.893
He really scared me.
The cops showed up.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.242
It was all okay in the end.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.634
It was just a little
bit embarrassing.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.506
Ah, Billy.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.160
He probably really enjoyed it.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.639
Any chance to go clubbing.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.640
He the man.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.297
While you two were out
playing cops and robbers,

15:07.428 --> 15:08.255
I read five books.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.476
Gee, Tammy. That's
a lotta coloring.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.000
Well ha ha.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.045
One of them was on anti-gravity.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.525
Couldn't put it down.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.573
Found Books, Tammy speaking.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.314
Vikings everywhere.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.577
You know what? Let's put these
on the summer reading display.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.666
The Viking dude sells books.

15:28.797 --> 15:29.885
He is hot.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.931
Sam, telephone.
It's Mr. MacGraw.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.584
Tell him I'm not here.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.283
Okay. Understood. Thanks.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.722
Too late. He's on his way
over to look at his books.

15:40.852 --> 15:41.897
His books?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.377
His books.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.421
Finders keepers?

15:44.552 --> 15:45.857
Not a chance.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.555
We have to give
this to Mr. Grumpy?

15:47.685 --> 15:50.384
Give it to me. I'll put
it in the cash register.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.298
Coffee money.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.273
Are you a
fan of the romance?

16:13.537 --> 16:14.886
Yeah. You could
say that. Yeah.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.237
Well, we have a lot of them.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.065
They're selling really well.

16:32.034 --> 16:32.904
Oh.

16:37.474 --> 16:42.262
Anyway. I'm sorry about the
bad mood yesterday, ladies.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.524
It's fine.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.700
I suppose Vikings are
allowed to be moody.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.615
No, it was just it was a
long drive up from the city.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.834
And my lawyer mentioned
that there was a letter

16:49.965 --> 16:51.836
that she couldn't find that
was in my grandfather's will.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.751
So I thought I'd take a look.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.623
- And?
- Ah, it was a waste of time.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.451
Didn't find a thing.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.541
I'm really sorry about
calling the cop, Billy.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.978
That's fine.
Just a little embarrassing.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.762
We all could have
gotten arrested.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.155
- Or worse.
- Okay. Just...

17:08.679 --> 17:10.855
I have your books in the back
if you just wanna follow me.

17:10.986 --> 17:14.642
Yes please. Lead the way.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.470
That's the thief.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.605
You don't say!

17:44.715 --> 17:46.848
Yeah. I'm not really
seeing much I want here.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.545
Well, I just unpacked
a bunch of paperbacks

17:48.676 --> 17:49.546
with your face on them.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.420
Yeah.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.292
I can't believe that my
grandfather collected these.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.598
Yeah. We wondered about that.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.167
Well, I guess I'll take 'em.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.560
I've never had a
complete set myself.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.258
- How many are there?
- Oh, I don't know.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.520
I've done dozens
of these shoots.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.696
But some are English historical.

18:08.826 --> 18:09.653
Some are Western.

18:09.784 --> 18:10.654
Some are

18:12.700 --> 18:13.875
almost naughty.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.053
I know. They're kind of cheesy,

18:18.184 --> 18:20.925
but I guess my
grandfather approved

18:21.056 --> 18:22.579
of my second career after all.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.798
What's your
first, Mr. MacGraw?

18:23.928 --> 18:25.626
Call me Josh.

18:25.756 --> 18:28.237
Mr. MacGraw kinda makes me
sound like my grandfather.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.760
I'm an architect.

18:29.891 --> 18:30.935
This whole modeling thing

18:31.066 --> 18:32.241
was just something
I do on the side.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.242
Hm.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.728
So you're selling
the house then?

18:40.858 --> 18:42.860
Yeah. That's the plan.

18:42.991 --> 18:45.341
I'm so busy in the city and
it's kind of a far commute.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.299
Oh, I'll say.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.390
Anyway.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.218
I guess I better
get to the lawyer.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.306
Oh, Lauren?

18:53.436 --> 18:54.307
Yeah. I haven't met her yet,

18:54.437 --> 18:56.744
but she seems nice on the phone.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.702
She's nice enough.

19:00.878 --> 19:01.923
- What?
- Nothing.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.403
Do you want any other books?

19:03.533 --> 19:04.839
Can I help you
with anything else?

19:04.969 --> 19:06.319
No, I think I'm good, thanks.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.321
I'm actually allergic
to dust, so...

19:08.451 --> 19:10.323
Must be a problem
when you're ransacking.

19:11.802 --> 19:12.760
These are all the
ones in good condition

19:12.890 --> 19:15.458
and I've dusted you off of them.

19:15.589 --> 19:16.981
Dusted them off for you.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.855
Thank you.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.249
Bless you.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.207
Maybe he's not as
bad as we thought.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.427
He's fine.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.257
Get back to work.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.359
Your grandfather owned quite
a few properties around town.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.490
I had no idea who was
so into real estate.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.711
Mm-hm. He owned some
of these buildings.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.843
Any idea which ones?

19:52.974 --> 19:54.671
Not entirely. My father knows.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.848
He managed your grandfather's
business affairs for years.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.677
I love these old main streets.

20:00.808 --> 20:01.722
The architectural detail.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.594
Oh, look.

20:04.725 --> 20:05.813
Like the decorative corners
in the crown of this building.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.858
I think those are
the original windows.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.556
That's beautiful.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.732
I love how passionate you are.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.342
About architecture? Oh yeah.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.564
These streets used to be the
heart of their communities.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.915
It's kinda sad when they get
hollowed out by development

20:21.045 --> 20:23.352
and big box stores coming
in on the periphery.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.701
What are you gonna do

20:24.832 --> 20:26.442
with all your newly
acquired real estate?

20:26.573 --> 20:28.183
I haven't not that far ahead.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.185
My architectural firm in
the city keeps me very busy,

20:30.316 --> 20:32.622
but I love what I do.

20:34.015 --> 20:37.236
Josh, you're a man
who knows what he wants.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.064
I like that.

20:42.763 --> 20:45.200
Yeah. I actually have a
conference call with the office.

20:45.331 --> 20:48.159
But I'll see you at 1:00.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.160
Can't wait.

21:07.744 --> 21:08.571
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:09.703 --> 21:10.660
Thank you.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.053
- Guess what?
- What?

21:12.183 --> 21:14.229
I just saw the Viking
with that lady lawyer.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.579
First off, Lauren
Lawrence is no lady.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.712
And second, ask me if I care.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.192
Sam, that's no way to talk
about an old school friend.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.977
She was no friend.

21:23.107 --> 21:24.500
Even if she was the last
lawyer on this planet,

21:24.631 --> 21:25.719
I still wouldn't hire her.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.198
Wow. Harsh.

21:27.329 --> 21:30.506
Sam's folks had a run in
with Lauren's father, Larry.

21:30.637 --> 21:33.161
They took him to court,
something about this building.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.295
He wriggled out of it and
they almost lost the bookstore

21:36.425 --> 21:37.426
trying to pay the court costs.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.385
Well, I was still
in school then,

21:39.515 --> 21:41.474
so I don't really
remember all the details.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.258
Too busy chasing boys?

21:43.389 --> 21:44.694
Oh, there was no point.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.043
Lauren had them all
staring at her legs.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.741
Well, I kind of
feel sorry for her.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.133
What?

21:49.264 --> 21:51.222
She's just as slimy
me as her father.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.616
She had to do
whatever Daddy told her.

21:53.747 --> 21:54.965
He groomed her.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.880
He sent her to the
finest law schools

21:57.011 --> 21:59.796
and then set her up in his
law practice as his partner.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.537
He's a control freak.

22:01.668 --> 22:02.799
I always thought it was funny

22:02.930 --> 22:05.280
that her dad was called
Laurence Lawrence.

22:05.411 --> 22:06.629
It's a good thing
he became a lawyer

22:06.760 --> 22:09.110
so that he can call
his firm Lawrence Law.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.286
But then to call
his daughter Lauren.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.983
I mean, Lauren Lawrence?

22:13.114 --> 22:14.855
Not much imagination.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.770
People call him
Larry Two-Names.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.075
He always repeats himself.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.339
He always repeats himself.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.473
Well, I'm glad
your grandparents

22:24.604 --> 22:25.648
didn't lose the store.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.128
Yeah, me too.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.086
If Tom Hill and Milly Dale
hadn't gotten married,

22:29.217 --> 22:31.524
I wouldn't have all this today.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.569
If it wasn't for
your hard work,

22:33.700 --> 22:34.962
this bookstore
wouldn't have survived

22:35.092 --> 22:36.485
after your parents passed.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.052
Yeah.

22:38.182 --> 22:38.966
And maybe I'd be out
there traveling the world

22:39.096 --> 22:40.446
and living a real life. Right?

22:40.576 --> 22:43.144
Oh, don't be so
hard on yourself.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.320
This is the family biz

22:45.451 --> 22:49.063
and you kept it going with
blood, sweat, and tears.

22:50.717 --> 22:51.631
Hill and Dale would be proud.

22:51.761 --> 22:52.849
Thanks, Tammy.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.461
Hey, time heals all wounds.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.854
That's such a cliche
and it's not true.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.813
Time just covers up the scars.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.601
Okay. That's enough with
this walk down memory lane.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.603
Let's get back to work, ladies.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.214
Thank you.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.834
So what's this
Joshua MacGraw like?

23:20.964 --> 23:24.185
Well, he's good looking,
passionate about his career,

23:24.315 --> 23:26.143
and very busy.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.015
I think I can keep him in line.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.669
Do you now?

23:29.799 --> 23:30.844
Do you now?

23:30.974 --> 23:32.715
Once he takes
ownership of the estate,

23:32.846 --> 23:34.151
I'll convince him

23:34.282 --> 23:36.066
to leave the property
management structure in place.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.591
I'm sure he'll be fine with
the monthly rental checks

23:38.721 --> 23:40.767
and stay in the city.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.856
There's nothing here for him.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.466
I've been milking
this cow for a long time

23:44.597 --> 23:46.425
and I am not ready to
give up the management

23:46.555 --> 23:47.643
of the MacGraw properties.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.341
Bob MacGraw. Ah.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.735
Didn't care about the business

23:52.866 --> 23:54.128
as long as the money
kept rolling in.

23:54.258 --> 23:57.174
Came in once a year and
signed where I told him to.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.916
Oh, thank goodness
for trusting clients.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.265
I wanted to talk to you

24:01.396 --> 24:02.658
about the missing
letters of codicil.

24:02.789 --> 24:03.703
Are they gonna be a problem?

24:03.833 --> 24:05.487
No idea.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.010
They were mentioned in an
amendment he made to the will,

24:07.141 --> 24:09.404
but Grandpa MacGraw
never produced them.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.797
Probably nothing.

24:10.927 --> 24:13.843
It's just the ramblings
of a senile old man.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.018
As long as you finish
probating the will

24:15.149 --> 24:16.019
before they turn up,

24:16.150 --> 24:18.239
then it shouldn't be a problem.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.980
Meanwhile...

24:20.110 --> 24:21.851
Get him to change his mind
about selling the mansion.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.940
That's my girl!
That's my girl!

24:31.600 --> 24:32.819
Tammy, check this out.

24:34.081 --> 24:36.126
Oh!

24:36.257 --> 24:38.607
Aw, I remember some
of those places

24:38.738 --> 24:41.480
from when I was a little girl.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.090
Not that it was that long ago.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.265
Of course, black and white.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.745
Just yesterday.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.707
Here's an interesting one.

24:51.838 --> 24:54.493
That.
The MacGraw mansion.

24:54.623 --> 24:55.929
Look at all the staff they had.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.365
Pretty stiff and starched.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.281
Who's that standing
in the middle there?

25:00.411 --> 25:03.414
That would be your grumpy
Viking's great grandparents.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.981
He's not my grumpy Viking.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.505
And since we're
buying his library,

25:06.635 --> 25:08.115
I guess that makes him a client.

25:08.245 --> 25:10.291
So a little bit more
respect there please.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.815
Hm. He is cute.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.687
I'd say handsome.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.340
I didn't say I was interested.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.473
Not at all. Not
even a little bit.

25:18.604 --> 25:19.518
Hmm.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.346
What?

25:22.477 --> 25:24.261
You need to
believe in yourself.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.916
You have so many
fine attributes,

25:27.047 --> 25:29.179
but you insist on
living like a bookworm.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.486
This business
occupies me 24/7.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.532
I don't have time
for other things.

25:33.662 --> 25:34.576
You should make some.

25:36.012 --> 25:36.970
Here's Grandpa
Tom and Grandma Milly

25:37.100 --> 25:38.319
in front of the bookstore.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.842
She was very pretty.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.844
Yeah, she was.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.411
She died the year
before I was born

25:43.542 --> 25:45.413
so I don't really know
too much about her.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.072
Back then, you had
to be very wealthy

25:52.202 --> 25:53.900
to belong to the sailing club.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.510
I like their outfits.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.816
Beautiful clothes.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.426
Even the children are
dressed to the hilt.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.604
And here they are having
a picnic by the lake.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.693
Could you imagine an
old Mr. MacGraw calling

26:04.824 --> 26:06.565
for an ice tea and
then some maid hurrying

26:06.695 --> 26:07.566
over to do his bidding.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.003
That's a good idea.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.134
I'm gonna make some ice tea.

26:11.265 --> 26:12.179
Want some?

26:12.309 --> 26:13.572
No, I'm okay.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.182
I'm gonna go for an
ice cream by the lake.

26:15.312 --> 26:16.531
I need a break.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.359
I'll settle for an ice tea.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.708
Thanks, Tammy.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.504
Ah, sorry about that.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.549
Client issue.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.029
They always want changes.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.161
Oh, yeah. It's the
same in my practice.

26:42.862 --> 26:45.255
I forgot how nice it was
here, down by the lake.

26:45.386 --> 26:47.388
My dad and I used to come visit
my grandpa when I was a kid.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.520
But I haven't been here
in a long, long time.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.088
I guess not since
my dad passed away.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.743
Do you remember
your grandfather?

26:54.874 --> 26:56.615
I had this picture
of him and I standing

26:56.745 --> 26:57.616
in front of the mansion.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.400
I always kept it with me.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.663
And then standing at the
property yesterday, it just

27:03.665 --> 27:04.797
brought back a lotta memories.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.626
Yeah.

27:07.756 --> 27:08.801
Speaking of the mansion.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.935
I think you should reconsider
selling the mansion.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.720
The way the market is,

27:14.850 --> 27:16.460
I'd toss it in with the rest
of your rental properties.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.201
Dealing with the renters
could be a bit of a headache,

27:18.332 --> 27:19.638
don't you think?

27:19.768 --> 27:20.726
Agreed.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.162
I think you should leave it

27:22.292 --> 27:24.120
with the property
management company.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.644
It's worked for
your grandfather.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.254
Yeah.

27:27.384 --> 27:28.908
Yeah. Let me think about it.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.135
Oh.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.139
Oh dear.

27:43.270 --> 27:44.010
I probably should
have told her.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.710
I heard you bumped
into her at the mansion.

27:48.841 --> 27:49.668
Didn't go so well.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.758
Kinda feel like I should
make it up to her.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.498
She's an odd duck.

27:54.629 --> 27:55.412
I wouldn't worry about it.

27:57.414 --> 28:00.374
She's gonna get money from
your grandfather's library.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.376
I'm sure that's all
she cares about anyway.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.990
You know, that's a good
time to do whatever...

28:10.906 --> 28:11.733
Hey!

28:14.780 --> 28:15.694
What?

28:19.654 --> 28:22.396
I used to read
these all the time.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.661
So there I am with an ice
cream cone melting in my hand

28:26.792 --> 28:27.967
and Josh is having a
meeting with Lauren.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.446
And then they started
laughing at me.

28:29.577 --> 28:30.709
And now Billy's being
all weird outside.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.232
I don't know what's going on.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.845
What?

28:36.976 --> 28:39.500
You look kinda cute with
rocky road on your nose.

28:39.630 --> 28:40.544
Hm?

28:46.246 --> 28:47.203
Oh my God!

28:59.694 --> 29:00.739
Ain't that life?

29:00.869 --> 29:02.653
Just one rocky road.

29:03.698 --> 29:04.655
Yeah.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.672
I guess I should
tell him about this.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.239
Yes.

29:23.370 --> 29:26.634
And you should give
him the $100 bill too.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.766
That's our coffee money!

29:30.290 --> 29:31.378
Call him.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.292
I'll think about it.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.599
Come on. Phone him.

29:35.730 --> 29:36.644
Okay. I will.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.037
But only to keep you two quiet.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.691
Now go away.

29:56.533 --> 29:57.578
Hello?

29:57.708 --> 29:59.101
It's Sam.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.624
From the bookstore.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.452
I was just thinking about you.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.411
Why? So you could
laugh at me some more?

30:04.541 --> 30:05.934
Yeah.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.675
I'm sorry about that.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.112
Yeah. Well you could
have said something.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.722
You're right.

30:11.853 --> 30:12.680
I should have.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.988
Look, hey, now that I
got you on the phone,

30:16.118 --> 30:17.424
can I ask you something?

30:17.554 --> 30:19.208
Are there any good
restaurants in town?

30:19.339 --> 30:21.123
Why don't you ask Lauren?

30:21.254 --> 30:23.517
I don't really like to
mix business with personal.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.609
Well, there's an Italian
place on Front Street.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.045
Great.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.656
Did you wanna maybe join
me for an early dinner?

30:32.787 --> 30:33.744
What?

30:33.875 --> 30:34.745
I'm business.

30:34.876 --> 30:38.967
I mean, this call is business.

30:39.098 --> 30:40.839
Well, not really.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.015
You know, I'm just asking
for a dinner recommendation.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.103
I called you.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.191
Yeah. Oh yeah.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.453
Was it about the books?

30:46.583 --> 30:47.671
Yes.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.631
Well, you see that's
business with the estate.

30:50.761 --> 30:51.850
Not with you and me.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.242
How's 5:30 sound?

30:54.940 --> 30:56.202
Okay, fine.

30:56.332 --> 31:00.380
But I need to talk to
you about some business.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.642
Dinner at 5:30.

31:01.772 --> 31:02.773
I'll see you there.

31:02.904 --> 31:03.774
Strictly business.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.167
What's that?

31:05.298 --> 31:06.212
I'm going for business.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.996
I mean, I'm going for dinner.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.650
- When?
- 5:30.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.434
Wow. You better get ready.

31:11.565 --> 31:12.392
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.351
Yeah, I better get ready.

31:15.482 --> 31:16.265
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:17.745 --> 31:18.659
Oh-

31:18.789 --> 31:20.530
We'll lock the front door.

31:20.661 --> 31:21.575
Okay.

31:43.989 --> 31:44.903
Hello.

31:46.078 --> 31:46.948
Hi. Hi.

31:49.690 --> 31:50.691
So sorry I'm late.

31:50.821 --> 31:53.346
I had to go upstairs and change.

31:53.476 --> 31:54.434
Upstairs?

31:54.564 --> 31:56.218
Nevermind. I'm here.

31:56.349 --> 31:57.698
Well, I'm glad

31:57.828 --> 31:59.569
'cause I was gonna drink
that whole bottle by myself.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.182
I can mix business
with pleasure.

32:03.312 --> 32:04.400
I'll help you.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.407
Thank you.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.105
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.981
Mm!

32:20.112 --> 32:22.810
Okay. Some ground
rules before we start.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.639
I'm only gonna stay
if we split the check.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.597
- Really?
- Yes, really.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.599
I do have
business to discuss.

32:29.730 --> 32:30.731
Okay.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.951
But could we order first?

32:33.081 --> 32:33.952
Sure.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.391
Any recommendations?

32:38.521 --> 32:40.523
The eggplant Parmesan
is really good.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.221
You a vegetarian?

32:42.351 --> 32:44.614
Trying. I don't
eat red meat anymore.

32:44.745 --> 32:45.572
I think I'll have the same.

32:45.702 --> 32:46.529
Excellent selection.

32:46.660 --> 32:47.530
Thank you.

32:50.533 --> 32:51.752
- So...
- So...

32:51.882 --> 32:53.580
Tell me about yourself.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.886
How did you get into
the book business?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.758
I inherited the
store from my parents

32:57.888 --> 32:58.715
after they passed away.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.587
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.154
Yeah. I really miss them.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.244
How about a cheers?

33:05.374 --> 33:06.897
To your parents and
the good memories.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.031
Thank you.

33:14.818 --> 33:15.906
- Agua?
- Yes, please.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:21.390 --> 33:22.435
It's okay.

33:22.565 --> 33:23.740
I'm a little bit nervous.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.090
Nervous?

33:25.220 --> 33:26.743
A hunk of a Viking like you?

33:26.874 --> 33:27.701
Mm.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.659
Yeah.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.314
Yeah, no, that's not me.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.665
Modeling is something I did

33:35.796 --> 33:37.841
just to pay my way through
architectural school.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.365
But it's fun.
You know, I like it.

33:39.495 --> 33:42.411
You get to make faces and get
paid to play pretend so...

33:42.542 --> 33:44.544
Well, my whole bookstore
is full of pretend

33:44.674 --> 33:47.938
so I completely
understand pretend.

33:48.069 --> 33:48.983
You know, I think
some people assume

33:49.114 --> 33:50.898
that models can
just do one thing.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.640
But, you know, most of us
have other careers and jobs.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.294
How did you get
into architecture?

33:55.424 --> 33:57.557
I always loved drawing
and building things.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.907
And when the modeling picked up,

34:00.038 --> 34:04.433
it took me to places like
Italy and Paris, Greece.

34:04.564 --> 34:05.869
Man, seeing all that
incredible architecture

34:06.000 --> 34:07.828
has just gotten me so fired up.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.395
That sounds so...

34:10.570 --> 34:11.527
Romantic?

34:11.658 --> 34:12.572
Yeah.

34:13.964 --> 34:15.401
I mean traveling the world,

34:15.531 --> 34:17.359
seeing things I've only
ever seen in books.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.231
All that history,
all that culture.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.060
Yeah. That sounds a
little more interesting

34:22.190 --> 34:23.061
than Sylvan Lake.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.109
Well, if you could go
anywhere, where would you go?

34:29.980 --> 34:31.504
I don't know.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.853
I've always wanted
to go to Italy.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.376
Well then, pack your bags.

34:35.856 --> 34:37.640
Oh I think the
eggplant Parmesan is

34:37.771 --> 34:38.989
as close as I'm gonna get.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.208
But it's okay.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.215
Excuse me.

35:35.394 --> 35:36.830
See, it's not where you
are. It's who you're with.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.099
To our health.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.622
That's pretty good.

35:46.753 --> 35:47.841
Brava.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.059
I like pretend.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.887
So do I.

35:51.018 --> 35:51.888
Good.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.458
Okay. But I'm serious about
this being a business dinner.

35:56.589 --> 35:59.113
- Okay?
- If you insist.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.506
Here. There you go.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.203
Wines of the world.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.771
Well, that's gonna come in
handy when we go to Paris.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.076
Just open it.

36:08.427 --> 36:09.558
A fake book!

36:09.689 --> 36:11.256
It was in your
grandfather's library.

36:11.386 --> 36:13.432
So I just, I thought
you should have it.

36:13.562 --> 36:14.520
Huh?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.524
Now we know the
budget for dinner.

36:18.654 --> 36:19.960
Okay.

36:20.090 --> 36:21.918
$100 dinner it is,
on your grandfather.

36:23.398 --> 36:24.182
And what is this?

36:26.009 --> 36:28.708
I thought it might be the
key to something special.

36:28.838 --> 36:29.796
Any ideas?

36:29.926 --> 36:31.058
No, none.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.540
But he had it hidden
in his library.

36:34.670 --> 36:37.934
Maybe it's a hidden passageway?

36:38.065 --> 36:39.327
Hidden treasure?

36:39.458 --> 36:41.373
Could be the key to
the missing letter.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.462
Yeah.
I like that.

36:43.592 --> 36:44.767
Okay.

36:44.898 --> 36:45.638
I'm gonna have to
go check the house.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.555
More business.

36:49.685 --> 36:50.991
More?

36:51.121 --> 36:53.341
We bought the library
as books by the yard.

36:53.472 --> 36:55.648
So it worked out to $1,000,
less our service fee.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.519
Well, you are the expert.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.782
But we found some
fabulous first editions,

36:59.913 --> 37:00.827
much more valuable.

37:00.957 --> 37:03.569
So I estimated their value

37:03.699 --> 37:05.484
and I wanted to
split that with you.

37:05.614 --> 37:06.746
So here...

37:06.876 --> 37:07.877
You didn't have to do that.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.923
I know, but I want to.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.359
The check's made
out to the estate

37:11.490 --> 37:12.882
so you're not gonna be
able to spend it tonight.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.842
But I'm pretty sure you're
gonna be pleased with the total.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.365
Dinner's on me.

37:17.496 --> 37:18.932
No arguments on that.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.716
Write it off as
a business expense.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.588
Well, if Lauren
will sign off on it.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.113
Lauren?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.593
You don't seem
to like her much.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.203
Why?

37:29.334 --> 37:30.813
To put it bluntly,

37:30.944 --> 37:32.859
she just, she made my life
hell when we were teenagers.

37:32.989 --> 37:33.990
That's all.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.557
And it still bothers you?

37:35.688 --> 37:36.993
No, it doesn't.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.691
We're certainly not friends.

37:38.821 --> 37:41.607
You know, she has been
privileged all of her life

37:41.737 --> 37:44.174
and just takes what she wants.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.524
Well, she's not
taking anything

37:45.654 --> 37:47.308
from me except for a
standard probate. So.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.528
And her dad, Larry
Lawrence, is even worse.

37:49.658 --> 37:51.051
My folks were in a
lawsuit with him once.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.661
Nearly cost us our bookstore.

37:52.792 --> 37:55.882
So I just don't trust them.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.623
That's all.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.102
Well, thank you
for the warning.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.190
Yeah.

38:02.541 --> 38:03.411
To my grandpa.

38:04.543 --> 38:05.413
To your nonno.

38:11.767 --> 38:12.638
What was he like?

38:15.075 --> 38:15.815
He was the kindest
man imaginable.

38:18.165 --> 38:21.429
You think about
your parents a lot?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.430
Every day.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.651
They left me the
bookstore, which I love.

38:25.781 --> 38:28.958
But, you know, it was a lot
to take on for a 19 year old.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.873
You've obviously
done very well.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.962
I get by, but it's
a lot of hard work.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.747
Keeping a good inventory,

38:34.877 --> 38:36.792
stocking the right
books at the right time.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.968
Like the romance novels
at this time of the year.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.971
The summer visitors just
come in and lap them up.

38:42.102 --> 38:42.972
Yeah. I can see that.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.846
So what kinda books do you like?

38:46.976 --> 38:47.803
Oh, all of them.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.285
But I haven't read a lot
of the romance novels,

38:51.416 --> 38:52.721
to be honest.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.114
What about you?

38:54.244 --> 38:55.245
Yeah. I've read a few.

38:56.421 --> 38:57.987
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.424
But it's research, right?

38:59.554 --> 39:01.034
You know, I have to
get into character.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.905
Of course. Yeah.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.735
It's better with
the wig and the whole thing.

39:06.866 --> 39:07.954
My parents made the
children's section just for me.

39:08.084 --> 39:11.261
So after school, I
spent all my time there.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.699
I was a real little bookworm.

39:13.829 --> 39:14.787
I just, I don't know.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.136
I love books.

39:16.266 --> 39:17.224
Yeah. I can see that.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.069
You know, my grandfather
used to take me sailing

39:36.199 --> 39:37.592
on the lake.

39:37.723 --> 39:38.854
It was magical.

39:38.985 --> 39:41.379
It was like flying
across the water.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.554
That's so nice.

39:42.684 --> 39:43.859
It was a nice night.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.559
Thanks for agreeing to
come to dinner with me.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.257
Well, I thought since we
got off to such a bad start,

39:50.388 --> 39:53.260
you know, give you the
benefit of the doubt.

39:54.696 --> 39:55.567
And?

39:57.046 --> 39:58.613
There's more to you
than meets the eye.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.268
I'm glad you feel that way.

40:03.836 --> 40:06.447
You, Joshua MacGraw, are
a very interesting man.

40:07.796 --> 40:09.581
Pretty interesting yourself.

40:09.711 --> 40:12.105
First time I saw you standing
there with the fire poker.

40:13.976 --> 40:15.804
You gimme a fire poker
and I can take on anyone.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.763
I believe it.

40:17.893 --> 40:20.330
Well, you can take
care of yourself.

40:20.461 --> 40:21.331
I like that.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.728
Well, I have an
early start tomorrow.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.817
So I'm gonna go.

40:28.948 --> 40:30.776
It's getting late.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.606
Will you come over to
mansion with me this weekend?

40:35.955 --> 40:38.566
Help me find a
lock for that key?

40:38.697 --> 40:39.741
Of course.

40:41.961 --> 40:42.962
Thanks for dinner.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.747
And I'll see you Saturday.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.140
Arrevederci.

40:49.185 --> 40:53.929
A presto.

41:21.522 --> 41:22.741
Ah.

41:22.871 --> 41:25.483
Good afternoon, Mr. MacGraw!

41:25.613 --> 41:27.789
Larry Lawrence. It's an
honor to meet you at last.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.530
Your grandfather
spoke of you often.

41:29.661 --> 41:30.662
He did?

41:30.792 --> 41:32.272
Oh, yes, he did. Yes, he did.

41:32.402 --> 41:34.927
He was quite proud of your
architectural exploits

41:35.057 --> 41:35.841
and your other enterprises.

41:38.365 --> 41:40.062
It's so nice to speak to
such an important new client.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.500
Well, I don't know
how important I am but-

41:42.630 --> 41:43.849
Oh, very important.

41:43.979 --> 41:45.633
Very important.

41:45.764 --> 41:46.852
You're gonna be one of the
biggest property owners

41:46.982 --> 41:48.680
in town, Mr. MacGraw.

41:48.810 --> 41:49.811
Can I ask you a question?

41:49.942 --> 41:51.509
Fire away?

41:51.639 --> 41:53.032
Are you planning on
moving back to Sylvan Lake?

41:53.162 --> 41:54.773
We have a property
management company

41:54.903 --> 41:56.165
looking after your
grandfather's interests.

41:56.296 --> 41:57.602
Would you like them
to continue on?

41:57.732 --> 41:59.038
Daddy.

41:59.168 --> 42:00.561
Let's not rush things.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.694
Mr. MacGraw likes
to take things slow.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.565
Ah, well then why don't you

42:04.696 --> 42:07.307
show Mr. MacGraw the territory?

42:07.437 --> 42:08.264
Sure. Come.

42:08.395 --> 42:09.352
Follow me.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.880
The art collection at Lawrence
Law is one of our passions.

42:15.010 --> 42:15.881
It's very impressive.

42:16.011 --> 42:17.230
And so is our practice.

42:18.710 --> 42:19.798
Now, how was court
today, Lauren?

42:19.928 --> 42:20.799
How was court?

42:20.929 --> 42:21.974
Excellent.

42:22.104 --> 42:24.150
We won, of course.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.282
I didn't think you're
coming in today, Daddy.

42:26.413 --> 42:27.501
Oh, thought I might.
Thought I might.

42:27.632 --> 42:30.373
Would be nice to have
some new blood in town.

42:30.504 --> 42:32.680
I should put Mr. MacGraw
for a local business club.

42:32.811 --> 42:34.334
Oh, please, call me Josh.

42:34.464 --> 42:36.292
Oh, and you call me Larry.

42:36.423 --> 42:37.772
Sure, Larry.

42:37.903 --> 42:38.773
I don't think Josh
would be interested

42:38.904 --> 42:40.906
in joining your stuffy
old club, Daddy.

42:41.036 --> 42:43.299
Well, when Mr. Josh sees

42:43.430 --> 42:44.823
just how much of
the town he owns,

42:44.953 --> 42:45.998
he may wanna be part of the
town's senior leadership.

42:46.128 --> 42:48.130
Well, there's
a lotta decisions

42:48.261 --> 42:49.175
to be made before
I decide on that.

42:49.305 --> 42:51.873
He's got a very
good job in the city.

42:52.004 --> 42:54.049
In fact, I was just offered
a promotion to partner.

42:54.180 --> 42:55.703
- Congratulations!
- Thanks!

42:55.834 --> 42:57.575
Wonderful! Wonderful!

42:57.705 --> 42:59.011
You're a very busy man

42:59.141 --> 43:01.143
and you've inherited
a big responsibility.

43:01.274 --> 43:02.928
Take a look.

43:03.058 --> 43:04.407
Now I handled the purchases
of these properties myself,

43:04.538 --> 43:05.974
but in the intervening years,

43:06.105 --> 43:08.194
the property management
company your grandfather hired

43:08.324 --> 43:10.196
has taken care of the details.

43:10.326 --> 43:11.501
See, I always
thought my grandfather

43:11.632 --> 43:12.546
was in the mining business.

43:12.677 --> 43:13.547
He sold out years ago.

43:13.678 --> 43:15.593
Went into commercial
real estate.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.684
Now, Lauren tells
me you're putting

43:19.814 --> 43:21.729
the mansion on the market.

43:21.860 --> 43:22.904
Do you think that's a good idea?

43:23.035 --> 43:24.297
Well, I do like it.

43:24.427 --> 43:25.298
I think there's a
lotta potential.

43:25.428 --> 43:27.779
It's just a lotta
work to update.

43:27.909 --> 43:30.912
Perhaps the management
company could handle it.

43:31.043 --> 43:32.827
- Yeah. I should talk them.
- I can do that.

43:32.958 --> 43:35.830
Now, Lauren is handling
the probate of the will,

43:35.961 --> 43:38.093
which I understand is
very straightforward.

43:39.486 --> 43:41.836
Your grandfather
made it very clear

43:41.967 --> 43:46.145
that everything goes to
his favorite grandson.

43:46.275 --> 43:48.974
Clear, except for the mention
of the letters of codicil.

43:49.104 --> 43:51.933
I asked one of my team
to look in the archives,

43:52.064 --> 43:53.021
see if they might be there.

43:53.152 --> 43:55.154
Or maybe they've been misfiled.

43:55.284 --> 43:56.416
Well, that's assuming

43:56.546 --> 43:57.286
that your grandfather
brought them in

43:57.417 --> 43:58.810
or that they even exist.

43:58.940 --> 44:00.202
Well, he put it in the will.

44:00.333 --> 44:01.551
So it must have been
important to him.

44:01.682 --> 44:03.075
I remember him coming in

44:03.205 --> 44:04.729
and adding the amendment
about the letters.

44:04.859 --> 44:07.035
I just don't think he
ever followed through.

44:09.124 --> 44:12.258
I hate to tell you this,
Josh, but the last few years,

44:12.388 --> 44:15.827
your grandfather, let's just
say he was a little off.

44:15.957 --> 44:18.351
He had little contact with
anyone and he seemed...

44:18.481 --> 44:19.831
Are you saying he
was incompetent or...

44:19.961 --> 44:21.093
Oh, not at all. Not at all.

44:21.223 --> 44:22.268
Sharp as ever.

44:22.398 --> 44:24.705
Just a bit forgetful at times.

44:24.836 --> 44:26.098
Maybe he intended
to write the letters

44:26.228 --> 44:27.621
and never got around to it.

44:27.752 --> 44:29.144
If they show up,
we'll deal with it.

44:29.275 --> 44:31.669
In the meantime, let's just
continue on the process.

44:31.799 --> 44:33.061
Not to worry. Not to worry.

44:33.192 --> 44:34.410
You're in good
hands with Lauren.

44:38.414 --> 44:39.285
Oh, you know what?

44:39.415 --> 44:40.286
That reminds me.

44:40.416 --> 44:41.374
What? What?

44:41.504 --> 44:42.723
Lauren, you
negotiated the deal

44:42.854 --> 44:43.506
for the Found Bookshop
to sell all the books

44:43.637 --> 44:44.682
in the library.

44:44.812 --> 44:46.335
Yeah.

44:46.466 --> 44:48.033
The owner gave me this
check last night. So.

44:49.774 --> 44:50.644
Last night?

44:50.775 --> 44:51.906
Samantha.

44:52.037 --> 44:52.994
Yeah.

44:53.125 --> 44:54.692
Yeah, we went to dinner.

44:54.822 --> 44:57.346
Just getting to know the
local business leaders. So.

44:57.477 --> 45:00.132
Anyway, this turned up
and I was wondering,

45:00.262 --> 45:01.524
do you guys have any
idea what this is?

45:01.655 --> 45:05.703
Hmm.

45:05.833 --> 45:06.791
No idea.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.010
Drink? Drink?

45:09.141 --> 45:10.055
No, thank you.

45:10.185 --> 45:11.317
I wouldn't show that to anyone

45:11.447 --> 45:13.362
or we'll have a treasure
hunt on our hands.

45:13.493 --> 45:14.886
What?

45:15.016 --> 45:16.452
If people think there's
a buried treasure,

45:16.583 --> 45:17.671
they're gonna be digging up
your grandfather's garden.

45:17.802 --> 45:18.759
You think there's
buried treasure?

45:18.890 --> 45:19.717
Of course I don't.
Of course I don't.

45:19.847 --> 45:21.066
I'm just saying what can happen

45:21.196 --> 45:22.763
when a silly rumor gets started,

45:22.894 --> 45:25.374
especially in a small town.

45:25.505 --> 45:26.593
Best keep it to yourself.

45:27.681 --> 45:28.726
Right.

45:28.856 --> 45:30.989
I am on a course all weekend.

45:31.119 --> 45:32.686
18 holes a day, if
you know what I mean.

45:33.774 --> 45:34.644
Fore!

45:39.171 --> 45:41.216
Just gimme a moment. I'm
just gonna go freshen up.

45:42.304 --> 45:43.218
Sure.

46:12.117 --> 46:13.771
So Mr. MacGraw.

46:15.207 --> 46:16.730
It's Friday.

46:16.861 --> 46:17.905
Let's celebrate.

46:18.036 --> 46:20.038
What exactly are
we celebrating?

46:20.168 --> 46:22.518
You came into a
very nice inheritance,

46:22.649 --> 46:24.564
thanks to your grandfather.

46:24.694 --> 46:26.479
I'd rather have him
than the inheritance. So.

46:26.609 --> 46:29.134
Of course. Yeah.

46:29.264 --> 46:30.439
There's a bar just
around the corner.

46:30.570 --> 46:32.354
- I'll buy.
- Oh no.

46:32.485 --> 46:34.226
I think I really am gonna
have an early night.

46:34.356 --> 46:35.575
But thank you.

46:35.705 --> 46:36.706
No date with Samantha?

46:36.837 --> 46:39.100
It was a business dinner.

46:39.231 --> 46:42.190
If you see her
again, as Daddy said,

46:42.321 --> 46:43.713
just don't mention
anything about key.

46:43.844 --> 46:45.715
Not until we know what it opens.

46:45.846 --> 46:47.935
Well, Sam's the one
who found the key.

46:48.066 --> 46:49.284
Tomorrow we're heading
over to the property

46:49.415 --> 46:51.721
and we're gonna see if we
can unlock the mystery.

46:51.852 --> 46:52.679
So to speak.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.681
Sounds like fun.

46:54.812 --> 46:55.856
I'll come help.

46:55.987 --> 46:57.597
I wouldn't bother.

46:57.727 --> 46:58.903
I honestly don't think
we're gonna find anything.

46:59.033 --> 47:00.339
As your council,

47:00.469 --> 47:02.210
I would strongly caution

47:02.341 --> 47:05.039
against sharing the
hunt with civilians.

47:05.170 --> 47:06.432
Well, we'll see.

47:06.562 --> 47:08.216
You know,

47:08.347 --> 47:10.828
how about we just go somewhere
more comfortable to wrap up?

47:11.916 --> 47:12.830
I could use a drink.

47:13.918 --> 47:14.788
Sure.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.398
Why not?

47:16.529 --> 47:17.965
So do you miss the city?

47:19.532 --> 47:20.881
Not really.

47:21.012 --> 47:22.317
Actually, I'm kind of
enjoying the break.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.015
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:24.145 --> 47:25.668
- Oh.
- Oh, you all right?

47:25.799 --> 47:28.062
These heels are awful.

47:28.193 --> 47:29.281
Yeah. I don't know
how women wear them.

47:29.411 --> 47:30.717
They look so uncomfortable.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.806
We're slaves to fashion.

47:32.937 --> 47:34.808
I wear them 'cause people
say I look like a model

47:34.939 --> 47:36.505
when I wear high heels.

47:36.636 --> 47:38.116
Do you think I
could have modeled?

47:38.246 --> 47:40.118
I'm sure you could have.

47:40.248 --> 47:42.598
Coming from you,
that's such a compliment.

47:42.729 --> 47:45.297
Seeing your work, you
look good in everything.

47:45.427 --> 47:47.473
It's good genes, I guess.

47:47.603 --> 47:49.040
I bet you look
good in jeans too.

47:51.738 --> 47:52.652
This us?

47:52.782 --> 47:53.740
This is it.

48:00.007 --> 48:01.443
- Oh.
- Thanks.

48:01.574 --> 48:02.401
Thank you.

48:04.490 --> 48:07.493
Excuse me. But are you the
guy on those Viking novels?

48:07.623 --> 48:08.755
No.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.278
Yes. Yes.
That's him.

48:10.409 --> 48:11.453
I knew it was you.

48:11.584 --> 48:12.628
I mean, him.

48:12.759 --> 48:14.630
She's kidding.
I'm an architect.

48:14.761 --> 48:17.068
A very handsome architect.

48:17.198 --> 48:18.721
Okay.

48:18.852 --> 48:20.114
Who's also a Viking.

48:20.245 --> 48:21.724
Okay. Now you're
just embarrassing me.

48:21.855 --> 48:23.683
It's not every day a guy
like you walks into my office.

48:23.813 --> 48:24.814
Or probably her bar.

48:26.512 --> 48:27.556
Okay, Mr. Viking,

48:27.687 --> 48:29.602
you've seen how much
property you own.

48:29.732 --> 48:30.690
What do you think?

48:30.820 --> 48:31.952
I might take your dad's advice

48:32.083 --> 48:33.867
and just let the
whole portfolio ride.

48:33.998 --> 48:35.434
As much as I'd love if
you moved to Sylvan Lake,

48:35.564 --> 48:36.609
I get it.

48:36.739 --> 48:38.567
You've got a great career.

48:38.698 --> 48:40.918
Plus your modeling work.

48:41.048 --> 48:42.049
You know, I did
always love it here

48:42.180 --> 48:43.572
when I was a kid, though.

48:43.703 --> 48:45.661
Hmm.

48:45.792 --> 48:47.881
It can wear
thin after a while.

48:48.012 --> 48:49.056
You don't like it here?

48:51.232 --> 48:52.103
Sure.

48:55.802 --> 49:00.024
Business is good and
summers are nice.

49:00.154 --> 49:02.287
But you don't seem happy.

49:03.810 --> 49:05.638
I'm fine.

49:05.768 --> 49:08.641
You know,
I'll tell you what,

49:08.771 --> 49:11.949
if I need cheering up,
I'll come visit you.

49:12.079 --> 49:13.080
Oh?

49:13.211 --> 49:14.908
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

49:15.039 --> 49:17.780
To a successful day.

49:17.911 --> 49:19.130
It was a good day, wasn't it?

49:19.260 --> 49:21.915
It was. For the both of us.

49:22.046 --> 49:24.135
And now that you're
a wealthy landowner,

49:25.919 --> 49:26.964
hopefully you'll let me
continue handling your affairs.

49:30.010 --> 49:31.011
My affairs?

49:32.708 --> 49:34.536
Business affairs.

49:34.667 --> 49:36.103
Business.

49:36.234 --> 49:37.713
Yes.

49:37.844 --> 49:38.888
Unless...

49:41.979 --> 49:43.328
you had something
else in mind.

49:46.548 --> 49:47.636
How long do you
think it's gonna take

49:47.767 --> 49:49.595
to wrap up the
probate on the estate?

49:49.725 --> 49:51.249
Not long.

49:51.379 --> 49:52.554
And the missing letters?

49:52.685 --> 49:53.686
They'll show up.

49:53.816 --> 49:54.687
We'll figure it out.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.429
All right.

49:57.559 --> 49:58.560
I'm hoping that
this is gonna turn

49:58.691 --> 50:00.823
into a long and
profitable relationship.

50:00.954 --> 50:03.652
Yeah. Well, we'll see.

50:03.783 --> 50:04.653
Let's let loose.

50:04.784 --> 50:05.872
Get to know each other.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.004
Okay. What would
you like to know?

50:07.134 --> 50:08.744
For starters,

50:08.875 --> 50:10.224
do you often get recognized?

50:12.835 --> 50:14.185
Yeah. Sometimes.

50:14.315 --> 50:16.839
You know, I try not to
make a big deal of it.

50:16.970 --> 50:18.798
What does your partner think?

50:18.928 --> 50:22.367
Oh, yeah. No
girlfriend, no partner.

50:22.497 --> 50:24.630
Hmm. Really?

50:24.760 --> 50:26.327
I find that hard to believe.

50:26.458 --> 50:27.981
An attractive man like you.

50:28.112 --> 50:30.114
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'm very busy with work

50:30.244 --> 50:32.725
and, you know,
traveling for modeling.

50:32.855 --> 50:34.683
It's not a lotta time to date.

50:34.814 --> 50:37.643
Is there somebody
special in your life?

50:37.773 --> 50:39.906
There was someone
once, but, yeah,

50:40.037 --> 50:41.255
it's all over now.

50:41.386 --> 50:43.997
What happened?

50:44.128 --> 50:46.217
I'd say it was
more lust than love.

50:47.957 --> 50:49.785
What's wrong with lust?

51:12.156 --> 51:13.635
Hello?

51:13.766 --> 51:15.246
Morning.

51:15.376 --> 51:17.552
Just wanted to see how
you're feeling this morning.

51:17.683 --> 51:19.511
Oh, I'm fine.

51:19.641 --> 51:21.643
I think.

51:21.774 --> 51:24.342
To be honest,
I don't remember much.

51:24.472 --> 51:25.778
What happened?

51:25.908 --> 51:28.259
Oh, you were very drunk.

51:28.389 --> 51:31.610
And a little too forward.

51:33.786 --> 51:34.743
Oh.

51:34.874 --> 51:36.136
I did take your keys.

51:37.355 --> 51:38.443
Oh, thanks.

51:39.661 --> 51:41.054
I appreciate that.

51:41.185 --> 51:43.230
Speaking of keys,

51:43.361 --> 51:45.537
I just wanted to remind you
not to do anything impulsive

51:45.667 --> 51:47.365
with that old key.

51:47.495 --> 51:48.279
Right? Uh huh.

51:49.932 --> 51:51.108
I hope I can see you later.

51:52.935 --> 51:54.459
Yeah. I'll have
to see how I feel.

51:55.721 --> 51:57.288
I'll see you at the office.

51:57.418 --> 51:58.680
Promise?

51:58.811 --> 51:59.638
Yeah. Promise.

52:01.161 --> 52:02.031
Bye.

52:09.648 --> 52:10.518
Oh!

52:12.868 --> 52:14.522
Oh no!

52:14.653 --> 52:15.828
Hello?

52:15.958 --> 52:17.308
Good morning.

52:17.438 --> 52:18.744
Ah. Yeah.
That's debatable.

52:18.874 --> 52:20.485
What? What happened?

52:20.615 --> 52:23.270
Apparently I painted
the town red last night.

52:23.401 --> 52:25.403
Oh dear.
Good company, I hope.

52:25.533 --> 52:26.665
Meeting with my lawyer.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.058
Oh. Lauren?

52:29.189 --> 52:31.060
Yeah. But it was just
a business meeting.

52:32.671 --> 52:34.325
With a few too many
celebratory drinks.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.762
Where are you now?

52:36.892 --> 52:38.067
The Anchor Inn.

52:38.198 --> 52:39.112
Look, I'm not sure
if I'm gonna be able

52:39.243 --> 52:40.983
to go to the house today.

52:41.114 --> 52:42.811
Let's do it another time.

52:42.942 --> 52:43.725
Oh, well, I've
made a picnic lunch.

52:45.771 --> 52:46.685
Well...

52:48.208 --> 52:49.644
And I've got some
ideas about the key.

52:49.775 --> 52:51.298
Really?

52:51.429 --> 52:52.647
Amazing.

52:52.778 --> 52:54.127
So I've been
looking through one

52:54.258 --> 52:55.694
of your grandfather's
old books about the town.

52:55.824 --> 52:57.870
There's pictures of the mansion
and some of your ancestors.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.437
I'd really love to see that.

52:59.567 --> 53:01.787
Do you remember
an old ice house?

53:01.917 --> 53:03.658
No, but I do remember
there was a big fridge

53:03.789 --> 53:05.138
in the kitchen.

53:05.269 --> 53:06.966
I used to sneak a slice
of the chef's apple pie

53:07.096 --> 53:08.576
every night before bead.

53:08.707 --> 53:10.012
It was so good.

53:10.143 --> 53:11.449
Okay. So it might
be a wild goose chase,

53:11.579 --> 53:13.625
but we could look
for the ice house.

53:13.755 --> 53:17.324
Or maybe any storage room
or maybe the basement.

53:17.455 --> 53:18.630
Sounds like you have a plan.

53:18.760 --> 53:19.805
Oh, I do.

53:19.935 --> 53:20.806
Aren't you excited?

53:20.936 --> 53:22.024
Absolutely.

53:22.155 --> 53:23.243
Could you maybe gimme an hour?

53:23.374 --> 53:24.418
Well, I will pick you up

53:24.549 --> 53:28.335
and I will bring
coffee and water.

53:28.466 --> 53:29.684
Sounds good.

54:15.861 --> 54:17.166
Come on.

54:17.297 --> 54:18.733
Let's go find that
hidden treasure.

54:20.866 --> 54:23.347
Just gonna finish
my coffee here first.

54:23.477 --> 54:24.522
Let's go.

54:24.652 --> 54:25.610
Mm-hm.

54:26.741 --> 54:27.655
Coming.

54:34.401 --> 54:36.447
How do you have so much energy?

54:41.930 --> 54:43.541
Come on.
Take a seat.

54:43.671 --> 54:45.282
Mm. Sitting sounds good.

54:47.719 --> 54:48.807
Okay.

54:48.937 --> 54:49.938
Why don't you look at
these family photos

54:50.069 --> 54:50.765
and I'm gonna go
find the ice house.

54:50.896 --> 54:51.897
Okay?

54:52.027 --> 54:52.941
Sounds good.

54:53.072 --> 54:54.203
Now we're getting to work.

54:54.334 --> 54:55.248
Yes ma'am.

55:19.751 --> 55:21.361
He is your iced
tea, Mr. MacGraw.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.323
Are you all right?

55:27.585 --> 55:28.499
Yeah. Yeah.

55:29.717 --> 55:31.719
I must have been dreaming.

55:31.850 --> 55:33.591
You were in a maid outfit.

55:33.721 --> 55:34.679
No maid.

55:36.898 --> 55:38.204
Thank you.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.640
Oh, did you find any
of the hidden treasure?

55:39.771 --> 55:40.946
No ice house.

55:41.076 --> 55:42.991
There's an old garage,
but the door is locked.

55:43.122 --> 55:43.949
You know, it's funny.

55:44.079 --> 55:46.038
Looking at these photos,

55:46.168 --> 55:48.040
it reminds me of when
I was here as a kid.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.652
People really knew how
to enjoy themselves.

55:56.091 --> 55:58.746
Man, this is quite
the spread. Thank you.

56:03.534 --> 56:04.361
Mm.

56:05.753 --> 56:06.928
I'm gonna miss this place.

56:08.495 --> 56:09.366
It's beautiful.

56:10.541 --> 56:12.064
It's got so much potential.

56:12.194 --> 56:13.935
As what?

56:14.066 --> 56:16.198
I was thinking maybe
a boutique hotel.

56:16.329 --> 56:17.548
Hmm.

56:17.678 --> 56:19.550
The lawyers don't
want me to sell.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.552
Why?

56:21.682 --> 56:22.814
They want me to throw it in

56:22.944 --> 56:24.729
with the rest of the
rental properties.

56:24.859 --> 56:26.644
I don't wanna overstep,

56:26.774 --> 56:29.298
but I don't really know
if I would trust them.

56:30.430 --> 56:31.388
Yeah. Maybe not.

56:33.215 --> 56:35.392
Though it probably would take
a lot to get it up to code.

56:35.522 --> 56:36.567
Yeah, but it'd be worth it.

56:36.697 --> 56:39.047
Yeah, if I was here.

56:39.178 --> 56:41.093
Well, why wouldn't you?

56:41.223 --> 56:43.225
I've been offered a
promotion from the firm.

56:43.356 --> 56:44.792
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

56:44.923 --> 56:48.753
And apparently I own a bunch
of buildings downtown too.

56:48.883 --> 56:50.058
It's funny, I've been thinking

56:50.189 --> 56:53.584
maybe I could start
my own business here.

56:53.714 --> 56:54.933
But it is a small town.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.719
How do you make it work?

56:58.850 --> 57:01.287
Well, I have to get
pretty creative sometimes.

57:01.418 --> 57:04.029
You know, with eBooks
and online book sales

57:04.159 --> 57:05.204
and all these big box stores.

57:05.334 --> 57:06.553
It's tough.

57:06.684 --> 57:07.685
You know, people
still like to browse

57:07.815 --> 57:08.990
and there's nothing like holding

57:09.121 --> 57:11.819
a real book in your
hands, right? So.

57:11.950 --> 57:13.560
It always helps to like
have a clever title

57:13.691 --> 57:15.606
or an attractive cover,

57:15.736 --> 57:17.216
like your latest Viking book.

57:18.913 --> 57:21.742
Hey, I didn't write it.
I'm just on the cover so...

57:26.094 --> 57:28.009
I've actually been thinking
about getting outta modeling.

57:28.140 --> 57:29.837
I wanna focus on other
things in my life.

57:31.665 --> 57:33.058
Sorry, we were talking
about the bookshop

57:33.188 --> 57:35.190
and now we're suddenly
talking about me again.

57:36.365 --> 57:37.671
It's okay.

57:37.802 --> 57:38.672
I'll let it slide
just this one time.

57:41.893 --> 57:42.981
You know, truth is,

57:43.111 --> 57:45.200
I've been finding this
a little overwhelming.

57:45.331 --> 57:47.942
Losing my grandfather and
inheriting the estate.

57:48.073 --> 57:51.032
It's not easy. You have a
lot of big decisions to make.

57:52.904 --> 57:54.688
How did you manage?

57:54.819 --> 57:56.298
Well, Tammy worked
for my parents,

57:56.429 --> 57:58.126
so she helped me
learn the ropes.

57:58.257 --> 58:02.479
And I just put my head
down and kept going.

58:02.609 --> 58:03.523
I really admire you.

58:04.698 --> 58:06.352
Thank you.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.049
Yeah, it hasn't been easy.

58:08.180 --> 58:09.573
The rent on the
building keeps going up

58:09.703 --> 58:11.618
and I had to sell our house

58:11.749 --> 58:13.664
and move into the room
above the bookstore.

58:13.794 --> 58:14.795
Really?

58:14.926 --> 58:15.796
It's not all that bad.

58:15.927 --> 58:17.276
I actually really
love the space.

58:17.406 --> 58:19.626
It's all like
old post and beam.

58:19.757 --> 58:21.149
Nice.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.673
You know a good architect
could probably turn it

58:22.803 --> 58:24.065
into something really special.

58:25.806 --> 58:28.853
Yeah, I think I could
recommend one. Yeah.

58:28.983 --> 58:30.855
You know, our little
town has a lot to offer.

58:32.509 --> 58:35.512
I'm starting to see that.

58:52.485 --> 58:53.617
- Okay.
- Thank you.

58:53.747 --> 58:55.619
So, next.

58:55.749 --> 58:57.490
- Check the storage room?
- Sure.

58:57.621 --> 58:58.839
Good.

58:58.970 --> 59:00.101
There used to be a lotta
spiders down there.

59:00.232 --> 59:01.407
- Seriously?
- Oh yeah.

59:01.538 --> 59:03.104
Huge ones.

59:03.235 --> 59:04.932
But you're not afraid, are you?

59:05.063 --> 59:06.760
No. Of course not.

59:06.891 --> 59:08.327
Oh good. All right.
Lead the way.

59:11.199 --> 59:12.592
- Okay.
- All right.

59:13.811 --> 59:15.334
What do we got here?

59:30.044 --> 59:31.002
I've already checked the
cabinets and the drawers.

59:31.132 --> 59:35.397
Oh, what about
fake walls? Panels?

59:35.528 --> 59:37.095
Now you're talking.
I'll start on this side.

59:37.225 --> 59:38.662
Okay, I'll start here.

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.871
One more sweep of the kitchen?

01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.046
Yep.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.407
Ah, our finest selection.

01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:29.843
Dessert, ma'am?

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:32.150
How lovely. Just
a small one, please.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.281
Thank you.

01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:35.066
Oh, no calories. Perfect.

01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:39.766
Onward?

01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:52.300
These are all built with
locally quarried sandstone.

01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:54.302
That's cool.

01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:01.483
Okay. So we're making progress.

01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:02.528
Uh-huh.

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:07.664
They used to host
all kinds of soirees

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:09.013
and formal events here.

01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:11.493
Oh, what do we got?

01:01:21.808 --> 01:01:23.723
Pleased to meet your
acquaintance, Mr. MacGraw.

01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:26.726
The pleasure's
all mine, madam.

01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:28.815
Welcome to the mystery mansion.

01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:30.556
I heard there's
a hidden treasure.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.212
This key is...

01:01:34.342 --> 01:01:35.735
The key to...

01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:36.693
Untold fortune.

01:01:37.824 --> 01:01:39.043
Or perhaps...

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:40.261
Absolutely nothing.

01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:44.352
Or maybe...

01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:46.006
Key to someone's heart.

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:48.139
You're such a romantic.

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:51.011
Shall we dance?

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.456
I haven't this much
fun in a long time.

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:48.416
I bet you say that
to all your wenches.

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:51.550
I'm gonna get an ice tea.

01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:11.613
This key has to fit something.

01:03:11.744 --> 01:03:13.877
We have to keep looking.

01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:14.791
It's a big mansion.
It could be anywhere.

01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:23.974
Maybe not anywhere.

01:03:25.497 --> 01:03:26.759
What is it?

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:27.934
I have an idea.

01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:39.511
What is it?

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.689
One sec.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:44.777
Josh!

01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:51.479
Okay. We're looking
for a key to the shed.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:52.567
Mm-hm.

01:03:57.355 --> 01:03:58.356
Oh!

01:04:00.967 --> 01:04:02.577
One of these has to be the key.

01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.579
- I'll take 'em all.
- Let's go.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.583
- No.
- Try these ones.

01:04:08.714 --> 01:04:09.802
All right.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.243
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:04:25.774 --> 01:04:26.863
Lotta memories here.

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:29.735
This isn't it.

01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:44.793
What is it?

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:46.839
It's a mystery
wrapped in canvas.

01:04:48.362 --> 01:04:49.320
I think...

01:04:57.719 --> 01:04:58.546
My grandfather's sailboat.

01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:01.375
Wow. It's beautiful.

01:05:01.506 --> 01:05:02.637
He loved this boat.

01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:05.902
Check this out.

01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.688
Hey, I remember that heart.

01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:10.819
What do you mean?

01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:13.648
We pillage the boat.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:16.651
Treasure's gotta
be here somewhere.

01:05:16.782 --> 01:05:17.696
Come on.

01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:39.805
Okay.

01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:46.159
You do the honors.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.160
Really?

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.249
Yeah.

01:05:53.819 --> 01:05:55.125
It fits, but it doesn't turn.

01:05:56.387 --> 01:05:57.562
Wait, I have an idea.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:02.741
Okay.

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:10.618
Try this.

01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:11.663
Oh.

01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:15.884
The oil'll take a
little time to work.

01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:18.365
Drink while we wait?

01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:19.410
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:30.203
Cheers.

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:31.639
We don't even know
what's in it yet.

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:33.293
We will soon.

01:06:33.424 --> 01:06:35.774
To sailing and strong winds.

01:06:39.865 --> 01:06:40.997
Hi, guys.

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:42.520
Josh.

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:44.478
Samantha.

01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:45.871
What are you doing?

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.091
I think we found what
we were looking for.

01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:49.396
We just can't get it open.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:51.746
I knew you wouldn't
take my advice

01:06:51.877 --> 01:06:53.792
about keeping the key a secret.

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:55.968
Well, I wouldn't have
found it without Sam. So.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.797
You know, as
executor of the estate,

01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:00.451
I'll take care of this.

01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.496
I'll get a certified
locksmith to open it

01:07:02.627 --> 01:07:05.021
and then we can review
the contents at my office.

01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:07.371
Okay.

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:09.677
Had a lotta fun last night.

01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:12.985
Here are your car keys.

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:15.596
Later, Josh.

01:07:19.992 --> 01:07:21.689
Yeah, I think
I'm just gonna go.

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.604
Sam!

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:24.605
Wait!

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:35.877
So Josh and I,

01:07:36.008 --> 01:07:36.835
we went to the MacGraw
mansion and we had a picnic.

01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.315
That's good.

01:07:38.445 --> 01:07:39.403
Yeah. You know, and we
had a lotta fun looking

01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:41.013
for the mystery key box.

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.797
And then we found a box in
his grandfather's sailboat.

01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:43.885
The key fit.

01:07:44.016 --> 01:07:45.061
That's really good.

01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:46.801
Then Lauren shows up.

01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:49.065
- Not so good.
- She ruined everything.

01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:50.849
You know, I thought Josh
and I had something going.

01:07:50.979 --> 01:07:52.068
And then she took the box

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:53.199
because she's in
charge of the estate.

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:54.200
And I just, I don't know.

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:55.462
I just don't trust her.

01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:58.074
But Josh seems to
think she's okay.

01:07:58.204 --> 01:08:00.206
I mean, maybe more than okay.

01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:02.339
Well, hey, there's always
another book on the shelf.

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:03.862
Tammy.

01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:06.691
I hope it's not me that
gets left on the shelf.

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:07.909
I mean, what am I gonna do?

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.694
I thought I found a good man.

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.478
Someone I'm actually
interested in.

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:14.438
Give it time, Sam.

01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:15.482
I'm sure he'll come round.

01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:17.049
She's a very shallow person.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.094
He'll figure it out.

01:08:18.224 --> 01:08:19.443
You think so?

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:20.400
I have no idea.

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:25.013
But I do know that if two
people are meant to be together,

01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:26.363
they will be.

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:30.018
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.020
Shakespeare. "A
Midsummer Night's Dream."

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.066
You got it.
Now it's time to open.

01:08:34.197 --> 01:08:35.937
We have customers coming
and books to sell.

01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:40.116
Yeah. You're right.

01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:24.638
Found Books. Samantha
Hill speaking.

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:26.118
Sam. It's Josh.

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:27.685
Look, I'm in the
city for business,

01:09:27.815 --> 01:09:29.556
but I just wanted to call

01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:32.168
and explain what happened
between Lauren and I that night.

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:34.996
Okay. So what
did happen, Josh?

01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:38.826
I know what Lauren implied.

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.828
And, yes, I'd had too much to
drink, but nothing happened.

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:43.657
I swear.

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:46.182
I don't know if I believe you.

01:09:47.922 --> 01:09:49.097
Sam, I'm telling
you the truth.

01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.281
You can do whatever you
like with whomever you like.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:09:59.412
I don't care.

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:00.544
You don't care?

01:10:00.674 --> 01:10:02.546
Look, I have
customers right now.

01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:04.200
I just, I don't
have time for this.

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:05.331
I'm sorry. I have to go.

01:10:06.506 --> 01:10:08.204
- Bye.
- Sam--

01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:28.833
Hello, Lauren Lawrence here.

01:10:28.963 --> 01:10:30.226
Lauren. It's Josh.

01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:34.578
Josh. Nice to hear your voice.

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:37.145
Daddy was relieved you
found the mystery box.

01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:39.626
Oh good.

01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:42.020
What was inside?

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.804
You'll have to come
here and find out.

01:10:43.935 --> 01:10:45.197
It's a surprise.

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.329
Well, I'll be
back in a few days

01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:47.591
and I'd really like to get all

01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:49.680
this estate business
wrapped up ASAP.

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.551
I like it when you
tell me what to do.

01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:54.772
I just wanna get
on with things.

01:10:54.902 --> 01:10:57.035
I thought we might
grab dinner to celebrate.

01:10:57.165 --> 01:10:59.472
You know, I think
it'd be better

01:10:59.603 --> 01:11:01.257
if we just met at your
office and go from there.

01:11:02.997 --> 01:11:04.564
Oh?

01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:05.783
And I'd also like it

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:07.175
if your father could
be there as well.

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:09.613
All right.

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:10.744
Of course.

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:32.157
Oops.

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.683
Ah!

01:11:36.814 --> 01:11:38.337
These darn Vikings.

01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.994
I think the publisher is
really gonna like these ones.

01:11:43.124 --> 01:11:44.125
- Great Viking!
- Yeah.

01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:46.824
Well I'm glad it
turned out because

01:11:48.565 --> 01:11:49.609
I think it's my last.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.263
What?

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:52.569
What's going on, Josh?

01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:53.831
I think I'm done
with modeling.

01:11:53.961 --> 01:11:56.660
I mean, it can wear
on you after a while.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:59.053
Is it about the promotion?

01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:01.273
Just think it's
time for change.

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:03.057
A certain someone perhaps?

01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:06.017
Yeah.

01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:07.018
Something like that.

01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:09.760
I'm gonna miss you.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.718
You were everyone's
favorite Viking.

01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:15.026
Not to mention cowboy,
warrior, hunter.

01:12:16.244 --> 01:12:17.985
I'm gonna miss you too.

01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:20.336
And I'm really gonna miss all
the cool costumes and makeup,

01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:22.468
but don't you go
telling anyone, okay?

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:23.513
Our secret.

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:27.081
So what are you gonna do
about that certain someone?

01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:31.216
Last time we spoke,
she hung up on me.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.044
- So...
- Well, that's not good.

01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:34.654
Have you thought
about flowers?

01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:35.916
It always worked on me.

01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:38.266
Right.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:39.964
Hey, no regrets.

01:12:40.094 --> 01:12:41.487
It was great while it lasted.

01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:44.838
But honestly, Josh, I'm
just too into my career.

01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:47.232
Whoever she is, she
must be someone special.

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:53.543
Yeah, she is.

01:13:03.944 --> 01:13:06.512
Why are books so
afraid of their sequel?

01:13:06.643 --> 01:13:07.774
Why?

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:09.254
Because they always
come after them.

01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:12.866
These just arrived.

01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:14.172
Cool.

01:13:14.302 --> 01:13:16.130
Does it say who they're from?

01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:17.567
As if we couldn't guess.

01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:22.833
"For my key friend,
something to unlock your heart.

01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:24.835
The Viking."

01:13:24.965 --> 01:13:26.706
So romantic.

01:13:26.837 --> 01:13:27.751
Oh, please.

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:29.666
That gives me an idea.

01:13:29.796 --> 01:13:31.581
I wonder if the Viking would
do a promo appearance here.

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.844
You know, in full Viking stuff.

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:36.107
Oh, that is a great idea.

01:13:36.237 --> 01:13:37.804
I mean, the cutout's good,

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:42.069
but Josh himself would really
bring the customers in.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.157
Hmm.

01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:44.985
It's worth a try, I guess.

01:13:45.116 --> 01:13:47.684
I think you just wanna
see more of his chest.

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:49.425
Nah.

01:13:49.555 --> 01:13:51.165
This is just business.

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:52.123
Here's Josh.

01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:56.867
You're in
trouble, little missy.

01:13:56.997 --> 01:13:57.781
Trouble with what?

01:13:58.912 --> 01:13:59.913
Nothing.

01:14:02.046 --> 01:14:03.656
You know, I was just
thinking about you.

01:14:05.702 --> 01:14:07.007
That's nice.

01:14:07.138 --> 01:14:09.096
I just got the roses.
They're lovely.

01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:10.446
Thank you.

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:11.359
Well, it's the
least I could do.

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.970
Can I ask you something?

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.626
Would you mind coming to the
store and being a Viking?

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:19.977
Why?

01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.413
Just to help with publicity.

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:23.067
I mean, if you'd prefer,

01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:24.895
I can liaise through your
publisher's PR department.

01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:28.246
I just, I thought it'd be
easier if I called you.

01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:29.943
Well, as of today,

01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:32.946
I kinda quit the Viking
business altogether.

01:14:33.077 --> 01:14:33.991
Really?

01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:35.253
What do you mean?

01:14:35.383 --> 01:14:37.081
I'll be back
in Sylvan tomorrow.

01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:38.691
I'll explain everything. Okay?

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.389
Okay.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.782
Arrevederci!

01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:44.567
A presto.

01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:53.837
What are you two looking at?

01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:54.881
Hm?

01:14:59.843 --> 01:15:02.149
How was the drive last night?

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.848
Long, as usual.

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:07.590
Hopefully this won't take
long and then we can celebrate.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.505
Good morning. Good morning.

01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:12.856
Has Lauren showed
you the big surprise?

01:15:12.986 --> 01:15:13.857
No, I just arrived.

01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:17.774
Take a look.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.701
What is this?

01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:36.662
Your grandfather got his start
during the local gold rush.

01:15:37.924 --> 01:15:39.012
I had no idea.

01:15:43.147 --> 01:15:44.714
What is all this?

01:15:44.844 --> 01:15:46.629
Oh, some old newspaper
clippings about your grandfather

01:15:46.759 --> 01:15:48.544
winning a local
sailing club race.

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:49.936
You could have them framed.

01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:51.721
It would make a nice
little memory pic.

01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:55.463
And that's it, huh?

01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:57.465
Mystery solved.
Mystery solved.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:08.694
What are you doing?

01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:14.918
The missing letter.

01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:17.877
Three letters. Three letters.

01:16:18.008 --> 01:16:19.792
We can count, Daddy.

01:16:28.888 --> 01:16:30.324
Dear, Joshua.

01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:32.413
I'm glad you followed the
trail and found the box.

01:16:32.544 --> 01:16:34.633
Larry Lawrence made
me a lotta money,

01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:36.592
but I never really trusted him.

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:38.855
Watch your back. Always.

01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:39.769
Love and respect,
your grandfather.

01:16:44.904 --> 01:16:46.079
What's it say? What's it say?

01:16:47.559 --> 01:16:49.039
Just a private message
from my grandfather.

01:16:49.169 --> 01:16:50.170
Huh?

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.042
More mystery. More mystery.

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:13.063
That looks like a
young Robert MacGraw.

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:15.761
I don't know who
the young woman is.

01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:16.806
Huh.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:23.813
Dear, Robert.

01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:26.642
I very much regret that
I cannot marry you.

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:28.861
I know this is not the
answer you wanted to hear,

01:17:28.992 --> 01:17:31.124
but I have fallen in
love with Tom Hill.

01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:33.823
I will always hold you
in the utmost affection.

01:17:33.953 --> 01:17:36.608
With loving
friendship, Milly Dale.

01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:39.611
This is about Tom
Hill and Milly Dale.

01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:42.266
The original proprietors
of Found Books?

01:17:42.396 --> 01:17:43.876
Sam's grandparents?

01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:55.714
"Private.

01:17:55.845 --> 01:17:57.150
Only to be opened
after my death.

01:17:58.412 --> 01:17:59.718
Robert MacGraw."

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:07.944
My beloved Milly

01:18:08.074 --> 01:18:10.860
would not accept my
proposal of marriage,

01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:14.341
but we remained loving
friends our whole lives.

01:18:14.472 --> 01:18:16.779
As a token of that love,
I leave her granddaughter,

01:18:16.909 --> 01:18:17.997
Samantha Hill...

01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:18.998
What does it say?

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:24.090
A holographic codicil.

01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:27.267
How unusual! How unusual!

01:18:29.139 --> 01:18:30.009
Is it legal?

01:18:31.184 --> 01:18:32.446
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:33.709
Unless you, as the sole heir,
decide to contest it.

01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:36.668
No.

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:37.669
Oh.

01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:48.724
What's in the envelope?

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:52.249
What a surprise.

01:18:55.556 --> 01:18:58.516
Josh, this is such
a romantic story.

01:18:58.646 --> 01:18:59.735
I mean, when I said we
had a surprise for you,

01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:03.608
I didn't expect it to be this.

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:06.219
I'm so excited for us.

01:19:07.655 --> 01:19:09.527
Us?

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:11.224
All of us. All of us.

01:19:11.355 --> 01:19:12.965
Now that the missing
letter has shown itself,

01:19:13.096 --> 01:19:14.750
the execution of the will
should go quite quickly.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.534
You can get back to
your architectural work

01:19:16.664 --> 01:19:20.668
and the rental property
checks will start rolling in.

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.065
Time to celebrate,
Mr. MacGraw.

01:19:26.196 --> 01:19:30.156
You know, actually, speaking
of the rental properties,

01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:32.289
how do I get in contact
with the management company?

01:19:32.419 --> 01:19:33.290
Oh, let me take care of that.

01:19:35.074 --> 01:19:36.075
Like you did for
my grandfather?

01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:38.730
Worked for him.
Worked for him.

01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:42.125
What's the name of
the company, Larry?

01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:46.651
Josh, let Daddy handle it.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.045
Let's get a drink.

01:19:49.175 --> 01:19:52.309
Yeah. The name of the company
is Sylvan Properties LLC.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.181
What of it?

01:19:55.312 --> 01:20:00.012
Well, I did some checking and

01:20:00.143 --> 01:20:01.753
the owner is Laurence Lawrence.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:04.930
Perfectly legal.

01:20:06.497 --> 01:20:07.846
Perfectly legal.

01:20:07.977 --> 01:20:09.326
Well, except when
you consider the fact

01:20:09.456 --> 01:20:11.894
that, over the last 20 years,

01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:14.810
all the checks you've
paid to my grandfather,

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.985
well, they haven't increased.

01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:20.903
While rental fees
have almost doubled.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.604
Your grandfather didn't care.

01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:27.648
Well, I do.

01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:31.522
I think you're greedy
and I don't trust you.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.004
Perfectly legal.

01:20:36.309 --> 01:20:38.007
- Perfectly.
- We'll let the courts decide.

01:20:38.137 --> 01:20:39.486
I had an accountant
look through all

01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.358
of my grandfather's records.

01:20:41.488 --> 01:20:45.101
I'll be suing Sylvan
Properties LLC for fraud.

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:46.667
And effective immediately,

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:48.669
I'm terminating my
relationship with Lawrence Law.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.193
Josh, please.

01:20:50.323 --> 01:20:52.760
There must be something I
can do to smooth this over.

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:54.240
Like father, like daughter.

01:20:56.634 --> 01:20:57.940
No, I'm not like him.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.941
What? What?

01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:01.073
You're greedy.

01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:02.509
My own daughter!

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.817
You manipulate and dominate
to get what you want.

01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:08.602
You're a bully and I am tired
of trying to be like you.

01:21:08.733 --> 01:21:10.866
Josh, please. Please,
please forgive me.

01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.346
I had no idea what he was doing.

01:21:13.477 --> 01:21:15.131
Liar!

01:21:15.261 --> 01:21:16.828
You knew I was skimming the
profits off old man MacGraw.

01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:17.829
You sat there and plotted

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.571
how you'd help me do it to Josh.

01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:22.268
Please.

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:23.226
I can be different.

01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:26.229
That's not me.

01:21:27.578 --> 01:21:30.102
Nice try, Lauren.

01:21:30.233 --> 01:21:32.452
But I think I have
everything I need.

01:21:36.326 --> 01:21:37.675
I'll see you in court.

01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:39.329
I'll see you in court.

01:21:39.459 --> 01:21:40.547
In court!

01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:41.592
In court!

01:22:10.664 --> 01:22:11.535
Hi.

01:22:11.665 --> 01:22:12.623
Hi.

01:22:13.841 --> 01:22:16.061
So I have a lot to tell you.

01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:17.367
Okay, what's going on?

01:22:17.497 --> 01:22:18.542
Don't worry.

01:22:18.672 --> 01:22:20.109
It's good news.

01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:21.719
Okay.

01:22:24.243 --> 01:22:28.987
For starters, I've
decided I'm gonna move back

01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:30.989
to Sylvan Lake permanently.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.425
What about your promotion?

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:34.079
I turned it down.

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:35.689
I'm leaving the firm.

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.779
I mean, that's great news.

01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:40.651
To have you here
in town, it's...

01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:42.479
Yeah.

01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:43.741
I actually
think your talents

01:22:43.871 --> 01:22:45.264
would be really good
for our community.

01:22:46.744 --> 01:22:48.659
So it turns out
that you were right.

01:22:48.789 --> 01:22:51.140
Lauren was only interested
in me because of the estate.

01:22:52.619 --> 01:22:53.620
You should have seen
her eyes light up

01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:56.058
when she saw the gold.

01:22:56.188 --> 01:22:58.625
Yeah, it turns out
my grandfather didn't

01:22:58.756 --> 01:22:59.887
just leave me property.

01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:04.936
That's amazing.

01:23:05.067 --> 01:23:05.981
And there's more.

01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:10.159
There were three
letters in the box,

01:23:10.289 --> 01:23:12.465
hidden under
a false bottom.

01:23:12.596 --> 01:23:14.467
A false bottom?

01:23:14.598 --> 01:23:17.035
This is sounding like something
out of a romance novel.

01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:20.952
So I did a little sleuthing

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.345
and I found out that Larry
has been skimming money

01:23:22.475 --> 01:23:24.347
off my grandfather's
properties for years.

01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:26.566
Well, him and Lauren.

01:23:27.828 --> 01:23:29.134
So I'll be seeing them in court.

01:23:29.265 --> 01:23:30.440
Good.

01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:36.837
The second letter
is from Milly Dale,

01:23:36.968 --> 01:23:39.449
your grandmother,
to my grandfather.

01:23:49.415 --> 01:23:51.548
That's my Grandma Milly.

01:23:51.678 --> 01:23:52.853
And that's my Grandpa Robert.

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.039
Emily.

01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:06.954
Milly is short for Emily.

01:24:07.085 --> 01:24:09.609
Your grandfather named his
boat after my grandmother.

01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:13.048
That's so romantic.

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:21.143
And now the best for last.

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:27.975
Okay.

01:24:29.368 --> 01:24:30.587
My beloved Milly

01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:32.110
would not accept my
proposal of marriage.

01:24:32.241 --> 01:24:36.549
But we remained loving
friends our whole lives.

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.943
As a token of that love,
I leave her granddaughter,

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.859
Samantha Hill, the property

01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:45.428
where Hill and Dale's
Found Books & Shop stands.

01:24:46.907 --> 01:24:49.475
And the enclosed as
a lasting memento

01:24:49.606 --> 01:24:52.261
of a love that might have been.

01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:53.566
Robert MacGraw.

01:24:57.744 --> 01:24:59.355
The bookshop is yours.

01:25:01.357 --> 01:25:02.619
I can't believe this.

01:25:02.749 --> 01:25:04.403
Sam, you deserve it.

01:25:09.452 --> 01:25:11.106
What did that last line mean?

01:25:13.238 --> 01:25:16.154
That's a surprise.

01:25:35.347 --> 01:25:37.349
That is all we've got left.

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.090
Hi.

01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:40.047
Help yourself.

01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:43.399
Okay, sure.

01:25:43.529 --> 01:25:44.574
You're really good
at this warrior thing.

01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:46.053
Viking.

01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:48.099
Whatever.
Pump those pecs.

01:25:52.059 --> 01:25:53.017
He's amazing.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.585
I was wrong.

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:56.586
Very wrong.

01:25:58.588 --> 01:26:00.459
Whatever he's got,
we need to bottle it.

01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:01.808
Oh, I'm trying.

01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:04.594
Get in it here.
I want a picture.

01:26:04.724 --> 01:26:05.595
Okay.

01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:09.947
How's my big,
bad Viking doing?

01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:12.515
Just another day of
pillaging and plundering.

01:26:12.645 --> 01:26:14.430
It's for a good cause.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.521
Yeah, but if one more little
old lady pinches my butt.

01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:20.349
- Oh my.
- I know.

01:26:20.479 --> 01:26:22.438
Not as innocent as they look.

01:26:23.917 --> 01:26:26.268
So what do you think?

01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:27.660
I like it.

01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:28.748
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:28.879 --> 01:26:30.228
But I prefer the real you.

01:26:32.665 --> 01:26:34.406
Good.

01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:35.755
Smile, you two!

01:26:41.674 --> 01:26:44.721
Okay. I'm gonna let you get
back to your Viking duties.

01:26:44.851 --> 01:26:46.940
Right. And I'll see you later?

01:26:47.071 --> 01:26:47.941
Absolutely.

01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:50.770
Okay, go.

01:27:07.309 --> 01:27:08.919
Such a beautiful night.

01:27:11.487 --> 01:27:13.097
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:27:21.627 --> 01:27:23.281
Are you proposing?

01:27:23.412 --> 01:27:25.065
It's a bit early for
that, don't you think?

01:27:25.196 --> 01:27:26.589
I'm just showing it to you.

01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:30.245
This is the engagement ring

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:31.811
that my grandfather
gave to Milly.

01:27:31.942 --> 01:27:34.423
It was in the letter
about the bookshop.

01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:41.560
"And the enclosed
as a lasting memento

01:27:41.691 --> 01:27:42.953
of a love that might have been."

01:27:45.912 --> 01:27:46.783
This is a lot to take in.

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.487
Don't worry.

01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:59.578

time in the world.
