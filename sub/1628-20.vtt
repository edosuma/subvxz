from telling us something.

You want to use the beans
to go back to the enchanted forest.

to get the package here, right?

I've spent enough time below deck
to not be afraid of the dark.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.934
So if this is your idea of torture,

00:27.069 --> 00:30.106
well, you're just going
to have to try a little harder.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.565
Torture you?
No, we just want to offer you a job.

00:33.993 --> 00:37.110
Oh. And then you're gonna let me go?

(LAUGHS)

00:39.415 --> 00:40.780
I'm sorry,

To see you stab the Dark One.

Well, look who's up to speed.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.223
I'm a quick learner.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.797
Well, then you know my work is done.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.049

01:38.766 --> 01:41.132
We know how to kill magical creatures.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.182
And the price?

01:47.024 --> 01:49.106
I need you to help me find someone.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.934
My father.

01:52.029 --> 01:55.021
He was taken in this town
a long time ago.

Why the bloody hell do you think
I'll be able to help you find your father?

01:58.661 --> 02:00.993
Because you know the woman
that took him.

Snow White was hiding here.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.252
And now she's gone.

to the enchanted forest,

04:18.175 --> 04:20.552
are we really going
to leave Regina behind?

04:20.928 --> 04:24.045
She's too dangerous to bring with us.
We have to leave her.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.924
But Henry won't like it.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.893
She is his mother.
Despite all the horrors.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.147
Mary Margaret,

04:32.231 --> 04:34.768
those horrors will continue.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.772
You want to give her another chance?
Because every time we do, she's...

04:38.863 --> 04:40.353
She slips, I know.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.777
What do we do?

04:48.873 --> 04:51.785
Instead of a second chance,
we give her a choice.

04:52.543 --> 04:56.035
Come back, live out her days
in Rumple's cell.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.712
Or stay here.

I offer these peasants a fortune,
and still they protect Snow White.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.856
Why are they loyal to her and not me?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.532
I am their queen.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.077
You did just slaughter an entire village.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.906
Maybe that's why they call you
the Evil Queen.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.581
I am not evil.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.210
They call me that because of her.
She's the evil one.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.003
They're her people, dearie.

with their fear.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.882

05:43.969 --> 05:45.470
Yes, they will.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.921
When she is gone.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.097
When Snow is dead.

of their homes.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.354
And I'm going to find her.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.359
Apparently, I have to do it myself.

Teach me my mother's
shape-shifting spell. Allow me to hide.

It took your mother
months to learn that.

06:18.462 --> 06:22.125

Put it on me.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.340
If I do,

06:34.186 --> 06:35.517
you won't control it.

No. They won't let me help.

They only see the Evil Queen,
which they made me.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.696
And I don't want to be that anymore.

are other people in our lives,

12:20.532 --> 12:21.692
She knows your name!

12:23.243 --> 12:26.110
How dare you address the knight
of the Queen's guard thusly?

12:26.204 --> 12:29.412
I know your names, you idiots,

12:30.208 --> 12:32.540
because I am the Queen.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.546
-(BOTH LAUGH)
-(STUTTERS) I am the Queen.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.335
I can prove it!

12:44.014 --> 12:46.221
(GRUNTS) Let go of me! Berkley!

12:52.356 --> 12:54.312
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

13:00.280 --> 13:01.269
Captain.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.690
You look like you've had a rough time.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.241
Indeed I have.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.570
I've come to ask you
for your protection.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.413
From Gold?

13:12.376 --> 13:14.287
I'm surprised you'd show your face
in this town,

13:14.378 --> 13:16.539
once you noticed
your murder didn't take.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.287
Well, we've got bigger problems.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.338
That man, Greg Mendell?

13:20.425 --> 13:22.381
The one who hit me
the night I shot Belle?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.336
Well, he's in league with some woman.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.388
She abducted me in New York
and dragged me back to Mendell.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.726
They want me to make an alliance
with you, and then betray you.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.395
That's why they let me go.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.643
And I say,
let's you and I make an alliance

13:37.734 --> 13:41.727
and we'll... We'll skip
the unpleasant betrayal business.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.064
Why should I trust you?

13:45.575 --> 13:47.315
I took up with your mother for a reason.

13:48.245 --> 13:51.237
Perhaps the three of us
could reestablish our alliance.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.249
My mother died.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.668
Well, that is sad news indeed.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.127
I'm sorry. She will be missed.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.136
I will tell you this, Regina.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.764
I knew her well enough to know

14:11.852 --> 14:13.717
that what she wanted most in the world

14:13.812 --> 14:16.098
was to see you win.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.682
Now, I failed in my revenge.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.940
The best tribute I could give her
is to help you with yours.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.775
Can I...

14:27.659 --> 14:28.694
(SIGHS)

14:28.785 --> 14:30.650
Let me show you something.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.785
Escape plan?

14:38.628 --> 14:40.368
Oh, she'd have loved that.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.380
She brought that giant for the beans,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.962
so she could go back
and start over with you.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.635
And now I'm going
to do that with Henry.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.137
If you'll help me.

14:52.017 --> 14:56.431
This is how we're going to escape
the total destruction of Storybrooke.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.804
If I can trust you.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.351
Now, when you say

15:00.484 --> 15:03.897
"total destruction,"
including the Crocodile, yes?

15:04.154 --> 15:05.735
(SCOFFS) Oh, yes.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.482
Rumplestiltskin will die.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.692
If you help me.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.620
Here you go.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.539
-No mayo, right?
-That's right.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.877
-(BOTH GROAN)
-l'm so sorry!

15:25.842 --> 15:27.423
He still hates mayo, huh?

15:27.511 --> 15:29.547
TAMARA: Avoids it like the plague.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.005
How are you doing here?

15:33.100 --> 15:36.058
In Storybrooke, I mean.
It's a lot to take in.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.175
Understatement.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.432
But I guess you know that
better than anyone.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.940
Yeah, I guess that's true,
but I had Henry.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.107
He got me through it.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.402
Right. Yeah.
Neal's doing the same for me.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.613
Even so, it's pretty crazy here.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.822
If the world found out about this place,

15:54.913 --> 15:57.370
do you know what that would mean
for Henry or Neal?

15:57.541 --> 15:59.623
Look, Emma, you don't have to worry.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.000
You can trust me.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.214
That's good to know.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.290
Be seeing you later.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.842
Yeah. I'll be seeing you.

16:16.017 --> 16:19.680
I'm telling you, Tamara is the "she"
August was trying to warn us about.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.011
Emma! (SHUSHING)

16:21.106 --> 16:22.312
What? Don't "Emma" me!

16:22.399 --> 16:23.764
(WHISPERS) Henry is upstairs.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.225
Look,

16:27.612 --> 16:28.897
I know this has been hard for you...

16:29.072 --> 16:31.279
No. This isn't about me.
This is about August.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.611
He died trying to warn us
about someone,

16:33.743 --> 16:35.574
about a woman. "She."

16:35.912 --> 16:38.403
Tamara has a list
of people who live here.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.454
What their fairy-tale names are.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.616
Doesn't that worry you?

16:44.462 --> 16:47.249
There could be a million explanations
for what you saw.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.043
We don't know anything about her.
And she lied to me.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.216
When she said I could trust her,
she lied.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.636
But your "superpower" has been known
to be unreliable, Emma.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.549
Especially when you're emotional.

17:00.478 --> 17:04.187
For the last time,
I don't have feelings for Neal.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.515
That was over a decade ago. I'm over it.

17:06.610 --> 17:08.441
Well, that may be,

17:09.070 --> 17:10.935
but if you tell Henry

17:11.072 --> 17:14.781
that you think his dad's fiancee
may be up to something?

17:14.910 --> 17:16.901
(WHISPERS) Then Henry's going
to think that there's a chance

17:16.995 --> 17:18.610
his parents could get back together.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.910
So keep it to yourself. Please?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.787
Till you know something more?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.245
(DOOR CLOSES)

17:29.341 --> 17:33.254
So, we're back in business.
I heard everything.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.378
I thought you were in the shower?

17:36.473 --> 17:37.633
Exactly.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.759
Operation Cobra is back on.
We're investigating Tamara, right?

17:44.272 --> 17:45.478
Get your coat.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.983
This why it's a two-man job?
You need me to lower you?

17:54.532 --> 17:56.864
No. Used to be.

And you? You?

18:18.014 --> 18:20.676
I had you flogged last spring
for lateness.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.052
How would I know that?

18:22.185 --> 18:24.176
I'm not liking her any better.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.347

19:21.870 --> 19:23.906

if this constant pursuit for revenge

19:24.039 --> 19:27.156
is the reason we have nO one
who cares for us?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.616

and I know the Crocodile is dead,

19:29.753 --> 19:31.709

19:32.922 --> 19:35.755

19:41.931 --> 19:43.796
it's an end, not a beginning.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.676
For you, maybe. Not me.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.762
I have Henry.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.064
And destroying Storybrooke?

19:53.902 --> 19:57.235
Well, that seems like a small price
tO pay tO allow us tO live in peace.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.783

20:04.412 --> 20:06.277

20:12.337 --> 20:14.123
It's hers and I want it back.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.795
You plan tO blow this town Off the map

20:16.925 --> 20:18.881
and you're worried
about a scrap Of cowhide?

But this one?
Yeah, kind of. (CHUCKLES)

27:27.522 --> 27:31.356
I thought by now we'd be having
adventures over there, you know.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.733
Just riding horses,
shooting bow and arrows.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.072
This is cool, tOO.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.443
Is that still something you want?

27:40.910 --> 27:44.448
I mean, if there was a way tO gO back
tO the enchanted forest?

27:46.666 --> 27:47.655
Is there?

27:48.292 --> 27:49.577
NO. Don't be crazy.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.081
There is. A way back.

27:53.923 --> 27:56.539
A bean or something.
The giant brought it, didn't he?

27:56.634 --> 27:57.965
You are a smart kid.

27:59.595 --> 28:00.801
That's awesome.

28:00.930 --> 28:03.592
We can get, like, a castle,
you, me and Neal.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.010
Oh, hey, whoa, nO way.
That... We're not... That's not...

28:06.102 --> 28:07.308
Duck!

28:15.987 --> 28:18.820
Operation Praying Mantis is on.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.451
Hang on. I almost got it.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.701
SO, once we find prOOf
that Tamara's evil,

28:30.001 --> 28:31.741
I guess the wedding's Off?

28:33.004 --> 28:36.747
Henry, Neal and I are not getting
back together, you know that, right?

28:36.841 --> 28:39.583
I mean, once he's single,
it could happen.

28:39.677 --> 28:43.340
Thrown together, moonlight, wine...

28:43.431 --> 28:44.591
Listen tO me, Henry.

28:44.682 --> 28:48.095
I am onto Tamara for other reasons,
not because she's with Neal, Okay?

28:48.185 --> 28:50.221
(WHISPERS) GO. GO, gO, gO.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.058
Ah, yes.

28:59.822 --> 29:00.857
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

29:00.948 --> 29:02.279
(WHISPERS) You gotta be the lookout.

29:02.658 --> 29:03.943
But what dO I dO? Whistle?

29:04.035 --> 29:05.900
NO, that's tOO Obvious.
You gotta hit the door.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.657
You know, like, just, like, kick it.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.529
Like you're bored. Like...

29:11.500 --> 29:14.663
Or, like, like, stumble intO it,
like, "Oh, ldidn't..." You know.

29:14.795 --> 29:15.921
Just hit the door, Okay?

29:16.005 --> 29:17.586
-Hit the door?
-Yeah.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.129
Got it. Now gO.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.531
(WOOD CREAKS)

29:50.915 --> 29:52.155
(CREAKS)

29:56.879 --> 29:58.039
Gotcha.

30:01.384 --> 30:02.499
-Hey, Henry, what...
-(MUTTERS)

30:05.554 --> 30:06.805
Uh... (BANGS DOOR)

30:06.889 --> 30:10.302
Oh, hell nO. Itaught her that. Emma!

30:10.393 --> 30:12.054
-(RATTLES)
-(SIGHS)

30:15.564 --> 30:19.728
SO, you weren't here and the door
was Open, then we just... (SIGHS)

30:21.570 --> 30:23.071
Emma, what's this about?

30:25.241 --> 30:27.653
Tamara. I think she's playing you.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.700
She's playing me? How?

30:30.913 --> 30:34.576
I think she's the "she" August
was trying tO warn us about.

30:34.709 --> 30:37.121
I didn't want tO tell you until I had prOOf.

30:37.545 --> 30:38.534
(CHUCKLES)

30:38.629 --> 30:39.664
Okay, yeah, well,

30:39.755 --> 30:42.007
as long as you broke intO our room
tO spare my feelings...

30:42.091 --> 30:43.171
Are you out Of your mind?

30:43.592 --> 30:45.173
He warned us about a woman.

30:45.261 --> 30:48.048
Yeah, which covers half the world.
You roped the kid intO this?

30:48.139 --> 30:50.926
She lied tO me. Remember,
I have that thing with lies?

30:51.017 --> 30:52.803
You thought you had a thing
with lies. I never bought it.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.508
Yeah, you did.

30:55.563 --> 30:56.552
Listen tO me, Neal.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.933
She's got a list Of fairy-tale
characters and who they are.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.055
Whoever she's gonna give that tO,

31:00.151 --> 31:01.982
that could blow
this whole town right Open.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.942
Emma, I helped her make that list.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.025
I have tO help her
come tO grips with this place.

31:07.116 --> 31:08.981
It's not easy, you know?

31:09.118 --> 31:11.780
She's trying tO deal with it for me.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.033
Okay, I know what this looks like.
But it isn't that.

31:15.124 --> 31:17.115
DO I look like a jealous ex?

31:17.918 --> 31:19.328
Okay, maybe I'm crazy.

31:19.462 --> 31:20.793
But let's find out.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.661
There's a floorboard loose
that shouldn't be.

31:22.798 --> 31:23.787
SO let's look under it.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.301
If there's nothing there, fine. I back Off.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.794
Okay. Yeah, sure. What the hell.

31:31.182 --> 31:33.173
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:38.481 --> 31:39.766
A little help?

31:40.149 --> 31:41.355
Oh, right.

31:49.742 --> 31:50.822
Oh.

31:54.330 --> 31:58.744
Listen, I know Tamara being here
is a little awkward...

31:58.834 --> 32:00.790
Don't. Henry, let's gO.

32:18.354 --> 32:19.639
(QUEEN EVA GROANS)

32:22.608 --> 32:24.144
Morning already?

32:24.235 --> 32:25.224
(SNOW WHITE CHUCKLES)

32:25.903 --> 32:27.018
We have one every day.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.817
Well, you look better.
I think you slept Off the last Of it.

32:30.908 --> 32:32.694
Yeah, I think I did.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.610
Well, you don't waste any time.

32:36.705 --> 32:39.447
Noises in the woods. Maybe a patrol.
We stayed tOO long.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.001
You're arming me?

32:44.088 --> 32:46.750
Well, just in case. Her soldiers
are ruthless. Stay behind me.

33:12.116 --> 33:13.777
If the stories are tO be believed,

33:13.909 --> 33:16.446
the Queen sent the Huntsman
tO tear your heart out.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.486
She did.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.662
How horrible.

33:22.084 --> 33:24.325
If you had her in front Of you now,

33:25.588 --> 33:27.670
would you kill her for that?

33:29.925 --> 33:31.005
Uh...

33:33.304 --> 33:35.010
Regina wants tO hurt people.

33:37.016 --> 33:38.597
I think she's in constant pain,

33:38.684 --> 33:42.097
and is always lOOking tO figure out
whom tO blame for it.

33:43.147 --> 33:44.432
We lived in the same household

33:44.523 --> 33:47.640
and still she could never see
that I was on her side.

33:47.776 --> 33:51.234
She wanted revenge
more than she wanted love.

33:51.322 --> 33:54.280
And I can't imagine living that way.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.403
I want tO be guided by love.

33:56.493 --> 33:58.950
SO, nO. Iwouldn't kill her.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.204
(CHUCKLES) NO one is that generous.
People aren't that gOOd.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.202
SNOW WHITE: NO,
I think they are. Even her.

34:05.002 --> 34:07.288
She's just afraid to look vulnerable.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.707
You believe there's gOOd inside there?

34:13.636 --> 34:16.548
I know there is. I've seen it.

34:17.139 --> 34:20.472
I wish she'd give herself
a chance tO be that person again.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.259
You don't think it's tOO late for her?

34:23.354 --> 34:25.970
Oh, I don't think it's tOO late for anyone.

34:27.149 --> 34:28.480
SO, if she...

34:31.320 --> 34:33.151
If she wanted tO change...

34:34.573 --> 34:38.316
If she wanted tO be a family again,
if she wanted tO be gOOd,

34:40.162 --> 34:41.823
would you forgive her for that?

34:42.748 --> 34:44.409
Would you let her back in?

34:44.875 --> 34:47.332
If she really meant it, yes.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.830
Iwould love that.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.966
I wouldn't mind a feather bed, either.

34:53.050 --> 34:55.917
But neither one is happening,
sO there's nO use thinking about it.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.717
She wouldn't Offer.

34:57.846 --> 35:01.259
Well, sometimes
people can surprise you.

35:04.353 --> 35:05.718
(WHISPERS) NO...

35:09.525 --> 35:11.937
We've gone further than I thought.

35:12.736 --> 35:16.729
These people are dead
because they helped me.

35:18.701 --> 35:21.693
NO. You didn't dO this.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.403
Oh, I know.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.871
She did it.

35:27.543 --> 35:28.953
I take it back.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.584
It is tOO late for her.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.415
I could never forgive her.

35:37.553 --> 35:41.512
There's nO gOOd in that woman. None.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.594
I was wrong,

35:44.727 --> 35:46.513
there never was.

35:47.688 --> 35:49.679
But what about when she rescued you?

35:50.566 --> 35:51.726
The horse?

35:51.942 --> 35:53.318
What are you talking about?

35:54.236 --> 35:55.271
Your story.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.061
About being saved.

36:01.410 --> 36:03.116
I never said it was her.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.202
I read between the lines.

36:14.256 --> 36:15.587
It was you.

36:18.761 --> 36:23.175
Regina, your dark magic is hiding
you somehow. But it is you.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.266
Yes, it is me.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.140
But there is gOOd in me.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.102
If this is your idea Of gOOd,

36:36.153 --> 36:37.689
I want nO part Of it.

36:43.786 --> 36:44.946
Damn.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.497
Rumplestiltskin!

37:02.638 --> 37:03.844
(SIGHS)

37:11.814 --> 37:12.803
(GASPS)

37:14.024 --> 37:16.140
-How?
-Startling, aren't I?

37:17.027 --> 37:19.439
Some people say "striking."

37:21.365 --> 37:22.855
You couldn't have survived that.

37:23.492 --> 37:27.451
Well, you should know by now,
the one thing I excel at is surviving.

37:27.538 --> 37:30.655
The amazing thing is,
you almost had me.

37:31.125 --> 37:32.956
All that stuff about a fresh, clean start,

37:33.043 --> 37:34.908
just killing them and moving on.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.618
It kind Of touched me.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.170
For a moment there,

37:39.341 --> 37:41.377
I thought we had a real connection,

37:42.344 --> 37:46.087
and, honestly,
I almost put a stOp tO my plan.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.170
Your plan?

37:47.266 --> 37:49.348
Well, their plan. But I fancied it.

37:49.852 --> 37:51.342
And they did save me
from that wretched...

37:51.478 --> 37:53.469
Whatever Maleficent is.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.392
DO you know these two?

37:56.692 --> 37:59.274
Well, they have a way with magic.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.647
Or should I say, a way against magic.

38:06.869 --> 38:08.530
Enough Of this.

38:12.166 --> 38:16.284
Yeah, sorry, that's not gonna work.
Not anymore.

38:32.186 --> 38:35.053
You know, I believe you. About Tamara.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.566
You should. 'Cause I'm right.

38:40.110 --> 38:43.648
And when we prove it, we can all
gO back tO the enchanted forest.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.535
You know, when we get back, Leroy,

38:56.793 --> 38:59.580
we're gonna need your help
restoring the palace.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.044
It's in pretty bad shape.

39:01.131 --> 39:02.371
Cosmetic? Or a total tear-down?

39:02.466 --> 39:03.751
Burn-down.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.469
(WHOOSHING)

39:10.224 --> 39:11.430
NO.

39:12.434 --> 39:13.799
What happened here?

39:14.728 --> 39:16.764
The beans, they're gone.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.483
NObOdy steals from a dwarf.

39:28.492 --> 39:29.902
WhO would dO this?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.862
Why didn't you come
when I called you?

39:35.958 --> 39:37.539
Sorry, dearie. DO I know you?

39:37.626 --> 39:39.958
I already have a maid.
Promising girl, actually.

39:40.087 --> 39:41.623
You know who I am.

39:42.339 --> 39:44.375
You were supposed
tO come change me back.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.626
(GIGGLES) Was I?

39:46.009 --> 39:48.261
I said you could call.
Didn't say I'd answer.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.126
Ugh.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.429
(COUGHS) Have the peasants
nO soap, then?

39:52.516 --> 39:54.677
Just take this damn spell Off me.

39:55.978 --> 39:57.184
I want my magic back

39:57.312 --> 39:59.519
and I want tO be able
tO get intO my own damn castle,

39:59.648 --> 40:01.639
-thank you very much.
-Aw.

40:02.109 --> 40:03.895
TOld you it wouldn't be pleasant.

40:03.986 --> 40:06.648
You wanna hear you were right?
Is that it, huh?

40:09.658 --> 40:11.148
Well, you were right.

40:11.702 --> 40:13.317
I like that.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.784
Right about what?

40:17.958 --> 40:19.994
They'll never love me.

40:20.377 --> 40:23.665
SO sad. And, yet, sO true.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.462
What dO you want tO dO now, then?

40:30.596 --> 40:32.507
-Punish them.
-(GIGGLES)

40:34.182 --> 40:35.592
(WHOOSHING)

40:40.856 --> 40:42.141
(EXHALES)

40:43.692 --> 40:45.523
The Queen is dead.

40:46.153 --> 40:50.021
Long live the Evil Queen.

40:53.744 --> 40:56.907
The cuff. You gave me this.

40:57.039 --> 40:58.404
Well, you rather insisted.

41:00.667 --> 41:03.454
-You knew I would want it.
-True.

41:03.545 --> 41:06.753
They rigged it with something
that blocks your magic.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.252
It's impressive. (CHUCKLES)

41:10.427 --> 41:13.544
SO, little bitty Owen does grown-up
magic Of his own, now?

41:13.680 --> 41:15.136
It's not magic.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.215
Actually, this is something much better.

41:18.352 --> 41:19.387
Science.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.853
You can stOp doing that.
It's not gonna work.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.021
You might be able
tO get rid Of the leather,

41:25.108 --> 41:29.647
but inside are the toughest metals
and machinery known tO man.

41:29.738 --> 41:31.228
And right now,

41:31.365 --> 41:34.402
they're counteracting
every magic bone in your body.

41:41.249 --> 41:42.238
Which one was she?

41:42.918 --> 41:46.035
She was the Queen. The Evil Queen.

41:47.464 --> 41:51.423
Yes, Iwas the Queen.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.463
OWEN: But now? Here?

41:54.596 --> 41:55.756
You're nothing.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.094
And what are you?

42:00.602 --> 42:02.888

42:03.271 --> 42:05.762
