WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:06.139
Mmm.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.244
‐ Hey, babe.
‐ Hey, Obie.

00:11.311 --> 00:12.846
Hey, Mr. Kellum.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.615
Oh, why the long faces.
The Knicks won.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.884
Yeah, but when I pulled out
a stogie to celebrate

00:17.951 --> 00:20.120
I noticed my wallet was gone.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.590
Eight bucks down the crapper.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.826
Yo, I bet it was
that Bulls' fan.

00:25.892 --> 00:29.763
The one with the high heels
and that Rodman wig on.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.665
‐ Hm.
‐ What a world?

00:31.732 --> 00:33.366
I can invent a diaper
that can soak up

00:33.433 --> 00:35.135
a whole cup of blue liquid

00:35.201 --> 00:36.703
but they can't protect
your valuables.

00:36.770 --> 00:37.938
‐ Oh!
‐ Um.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.041
You know, if you put
a electrode in your wallet

00:41.107 --> 00:43.877
you could link it to a sound
chip in your pocket.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.078
Yeah.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.847
You mean like those cards
when you open up

00:46.913 --> 00:49.650
they play "Jingle Bells?"

00:49.716 --> 00:52.786
Yeah, if you rig it...with
something, uh‐uh

00:52.853 --> 00:55.321
that would tell you if
someone's touching your wallet.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.191
Then it plays it catchy
Yuletide tune

00:58.258 --> 01:00.493
and you follow
the sound to the thief

01:00.561 --> 01:02.102
and beat the eggnog up
out of him.

01:02.168 --> 01:03.369
[laughing]

01:03.436 --> 01:05.572
Hey, I bet we could sell
a million of them.

01:05.639 --> 01:08.407
Well, you know I got everything
we need to build one.

01:08.474 --> 01:09.809
‐ Right upstairs.
‐ Yeah?

01:09.876 --> 01:12.078
‐ Ooh. Let's do this.
‐ He‐he.

01:12.145 --> 01:14.681
I love when he says that.

01:14.748 --> 01:15.982
Ooh! This is so exciting.

01:16.049 --> 01:17.918
It's like Newton and Galileo

01:17.984 --> 01:19.886
go off to invent gravity.

01:19.953 --> 01:21.154
Thanks for the compliment, doll

01:21.221 --> 01:23.724
but no one actually
invented gravity.

01:23.790 --> 01:26.159
Well, when you consider
the word "Invent"

01:26.226 --> 01:30.096
it's from the Latin, "Invenire"
meaning "To find."

01:30.163 --> 01:32.065
Technically, I think I'm right.

you're out of a job?

02:36.670 --> 02:39.773
No, no, Synclaire, I mean,
if the show had been cancelled

02:39.840 --> 02:40.874
I'd have gotten a call.

02:40.941 --> 02:41.942
Oh, yeah.

02:42.008 --> 02:43.009

Uh.

I am out of a job.

Seems the president
of the network just got dumped

03:13.413 --> 03:15.448
by one of the actresses
on the soap

03:15.516 --> 03:18.051
who left him
for her pool‐boy Pablo.

03:19.653 --> 03:22.122
Uh, she and Pablo ran off
to Rio at three

03:22.188 --> 03:24.591

dumped the show at four.

03:24.658 --> 03:26.593

03:29.730 --> 03:31.331

Kyle...take my wallet.

03:41.875 --> 03:42.876

03:44.410 --> 03:46.246

from the usual

03:46.312 --> 03:50.283

04:02.703 --> 04:05.506
‐ As an investment expert.
‐ Uh‐huh.

I would say that you two have
created a hokey impulse purchase

04:09.943 --> 04:13.446

I think, I gotta get a new

04:25.626 --> 04:29.095

"We'll be millionaires?"

04:31.565 --> 04:34.033
If I can convince my
venture capital group

04:34.100 --> 04:36.936
to invest in this thing
then I will more than deserve

04:37.003 --> 04:39.205

04:39.272 --> 04:40.373

I'm unemployed.

Damn, that is insensitive.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.188
Oh, oh, oh, now.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.157
Look in the bright side, Regine.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.660
You know, now you can
find a career that

05:26.727 --> 05:28.562
utilizes your special skills.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.281

05:49.382 --> 05:50.584
about opening the door
for strangers, huh?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.252
Man, what are you doin' here?

you all to my beautiful fiance.

(Regine)
'Well, you're Tina!'

06:05.038 --> 06:06.439
Come on, in.

06:06.507 --> 06:10.110
Regine, Darryl has told me
so much about you

06:10.176 --> 06:12.078
and I just had to meet the woman

06:12.145 --> 06:13.747
who let big daddy get away.

06:13.814 --> 06:15.281
She call me big daddy.

06:15.348 --> 06:16.717
[laughing]

06:16.783 --> 06:19.285
Oh, Regine!

06:19.352 --> 06:23.757
Isn't it ironic that after you
and Darryl broke up..

06:23.824 --> 06:25.626
...he invented
a parcel tracking system

06:25.692 --> 06:28.494
that made him richer than Oprah?

06:28.562 --> 06:30.030
I mean,
what are you doing these days?

06:32.198 --> 06:33.166

06:33.233 --> 06:34.668
[giggles]

06:34.735 --> 06:36.069
What happened to the show you're
working on...what's it called?

06:36.136 --> 06:38.639
Cancelled!
Ooh!

06:38.705 --> 06:40.006
[indistinct chatter]

06:40.073 --> 06:42.709
Excuse me for just one quick
little second. Pardon me.

06:42.776 --> 06:44.811
Shut up! Shut up!

06:44.878 --> 06:46.613
I think this is an occasion

06:46.680 --> 06:49.282
for a celebratory round
of hot chocolate.

06:49.349 --> 06:50.450
Okay.

06:52.886 --> 06:54.921
Hey, Regine, I'm sorry
to hear about your job.

06:54.988 --> 06:57.724
But you know, actually it's
perfect timing.

06:57.791 --> 07:00.634
You see, we came over actually
to coordinate the wedding.

07:00.701 --> 07:02.302
‐ <i>Moi?</i>
‐ <i>Mous.</i>

07:04.070 --> 07:07.908
Well, I would love to be a part
of your special occasion.

07:07.974 --> 07:10.644
So, have you guys picked out
a month for your special day?

07:10.711 --> 07:11.812
This weekend.

07:13.413 --> 07:15.582
This weekend? You guys..

07:15.649 --> 07:18.418
I can't plan no weddin'
in that short amount of time.

07:18.484 --> 07:20.654
I'll give you a $2000 bonus.

07:20.721 --> 07:25.191
‐ We'll FedEx the invitations.
‐ Yeah. We can do that.

07:25.258 --> 07:27.460
Okay, now it's gonna be,
uh, Tiffany gifts

07:27.528 --> 07:28.494
for the bridesmaids.

07:28.562 --> 07:30.330
Tiffany gifts
for the groomsmen.

07:30.396 --> 07:33.266
And I don't think we need to
discuss where we'll be shopping

07:33.333 --> 07:34.568
for the weeding coordinator.

07:34.635 --> 07:36.136
[laughing]

07:36.202 --> 07:38.972
Or the wedding coordinator's
assistant.

07:39.039 --> 07:39.973

07:42.142 --> 07:43.810
You know, this is like a dream
come true for me, man.

07:43.877 --> 07:48.615
I mean, my great friend
whose taste is unparalleled

07:48.682 --> 07:50.951
planning my special day
with my bride

07:51.017 --> 07:53.119
whose beauty is unparalleled.

07:53.186 --> 07:57.724
Oh! Give me some
sugar beetle bug.

08:00.534 --> 08:02.536
Ah! Ah.

08:02.603 --> 08:06.573
‐ Uh, excuse me, um, beetle bug.
‐ Huh.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.408
Have you two kids
thought about a theme?

08:08.474 --> 08:11.477
Oh! Obie and I have a great
theme for our wedding.

08:11.545 --> 08:14.848
The theme from "Shaft,"
shut your mouth.

08:14.915 --> 08:16.216
You know what
I always wanted, baby?

08:16.282 --> 08:18.484
‐ What's that?
‐ A Thanksgiving motif.

08:18.552 --> 08:20.787
Excellent idea, big. What do you
think we're gonna need?

08:20.854 --> 08:23.223
I think we need some little corn
on the cob and some, uh

08:23.289 --> 08:26.126
pumpkin pies, pumpkins of
course, and about 50 turkeys‐‐

08:26.192 --> 08:27.794
(Regine)
'Uh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.'

08:27.861 --> 08:30.631
I‐I don't know where
I'm gonna get 50 turkeys

08:30.697 --> 08:31.865
this close to Thanksgiving.

08:31.932 --> 08:33.399
Would a blank check help?

08:33.466 --> 08:35.135
I'll shoot the turkeys
my damn self.

08:36.703 --> 08:38.104
‐ Darling.
‐ Um.

08:38.171 --> 08:39.304
Daddy, I'm thirsty.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.073
Oh, let me get you
some water then, sugar.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.142
‐ Thank you.
‐ Oh, you know something?

08:42.207 --> 08:43.644
I better go with you.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.112
One of those water bottles' for
my hamster and he has the flu.

08:50.450 --> 08:52.753
Thank you, baby.

08:52.819 --> 08:54.555
Okay, look, girlfriend

08:54.621 --> 08:56.623
I'm havin' a glamorous
old‐fashioned wedding.

08:56.690 --> 08:58.058
Bump that Thanksgiving thing.

08:58.124 --> 09:01.301
Well, Tina, Darryl seems
to have his heart set on it.

09:01.367 --> 09:04.437
Regine, look at me.

09:05.438 --> 09:06.840
He'll adjust.

09:09.275 --> 09:12.846
Um, Tina, uh,
Darryl is my friend

09:12.913 --> 09:15.215
um, so, don't take offense.

09:15.281 --> 09:18.852
But I don't think you two are
quite ready to jump the broom.

09:18.919 --> 09:19.886
[chuckles]

09:19.953 --> 09:21.354
Honey, with the money
I'm marryin'

09:21.421 --> 09:23.824
I'll have my servants
carry me over the broom.

09:26.026 --> 09:27.894
‐ Here you go, bunkums.
‐ Big daddy.

09:27.961 --> 09:30.296
You know what you were
so right about Regine.

09:30.363 --> 09:32.666
I just know she's gonna do a
wonderful job on our wedding.

09:32.733 --> 09:34.100
(Darryl)
'You see, I told ya.'

09:34.167 --> 09:36.903
And, in fact, I believe you two
are gonna be great friends.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.138
Oh.

09:48.749 --> 09:50.551
This is a mess.

09:50.617 --> 09:54.254
Tina is a manipulative,
conniving gold‐digger..

09:54.320 --> 09:55.656
...but in a bad way.

09:57.991 --> 10:00.193
And that's exactly what
you're gonna tell Darryl, right?

10:00.260 --> 10:02.068
‐ Of course, I'm gonna tell him.
‐ Yes, you are. Yes.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.370
Why?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.741
I'm obligated to defend clients
even if they're guilty.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.075
Now, what's this
country coming to

10:09.142 --> 10:12.979
when you can't cash in
on pain and sufferin'?

10:13.046 --> 10:16.216
Regine, this is a perfect
opportunity for you to show

10:16.282 --> 10:17.918
you can keep your mouth shut.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.886
You'll be surprised
what a rush you can get

10:19.953 --> 10:22.689
minding your own damn business.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.490
‐ He's your friend.
‐ Client.

10:24.558 --> 10:27.093
‐ But you gotta say somethin'.
‐ No, you don't.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.461
Oh.

10:28.529 --> 10:31.164
This is the most appalling
situation I've ever been in.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.498
What,
you can't make up your mind?

10:32.566 --> 10:35.201
‐ No. I agree with Max.
‐ Oh.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.472
Don't sweat it, Ray.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.407
If anybody can get those
investors to back

10:41.474 --> 10:43.309
the Wallet Watchdog it's Kyle.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.979
Oh, if we can pull this off
I'll have some real dough

10:46.046 --> 10:48.214
for the first time in my life.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.384
Overton,
I was raised in a tool shed.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.255
My mother worked in a zinc mine.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.358
My first suit of clothes
was a hand‐me‐down.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.133
My aunt grew out of it.

11:02.068 --> 11:04.037
Oh, hey, Kyle.

11:04.104 --> 11:06.540
How'd the meeting go?

11:06.607 --> 11:10.110
I had a board room
full of millionaires.

11:10.176 --> 11:14.380
Spellbound with visions
of the Wallet Watchdog.

11:14.447 --> 11:15.481
Alright. There you go.

11:15.549 --> 11:18.251
And then I demonstrated
said Wallet Watchdog.

11:18.318 --> 11:19.520
Yes.

11:19.586 --> 11:20.554
Seconds later
I was twitchin' on the floor

11:20.621 --> 11:22.088
like a wounded wildebeest.

11:24.424 --> 11:25.892
Felt like someone
shoved a barbecue grill

11:25.959 --> 11:27.227
down my pants, man.

11:28.629 --> 11:31.765
Kyle, before your tragic..

11:31.832 --> 11:34.334
...somewhat melodramatic ordeal

11:34.400 --> 11:38.004
uh, do you recall
if you were sweatin'?

11:38.071 --> 11:41.675
Hello, I was talking to
a room full of millionaires.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.610
Of course, I was perspiring.

11:43.677 --> 11:45.111
Well, that's why it zapped you.

11:45.178 --> 11:47.080
Your own sweat
conducted the charge.

11:47.147 --> 11:48.248
Wait a minute.

11:48.314 --> 11:51.484
We put the electrode
in the wallet..

11:51.552 --> 11:54.788
...instead of the pocket, the
thief would still get shocked.

11:54.855 --> 11:56.623
It'd be like
a pocket‐sized stun gun.

11:56.690 --> 11:57.824
‐ Stun gun?
‐ Yeah.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.593
And we amp up
the charge a little bit

11:59.660 --> 12:02.168
it'll catch the thief
whether he's sweating or not.

12:02.235 --> 12:03.670
Yeah.

12:03.737 --> 12:04.938
'Kyle..'

12:06.039 --> 12:07.307
Oh, hell no.

12:08.675 --> 12:10.243
I cannot go back there, Overton.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.112
Man, do you realize one of those
millionaires had to shove

12:12.178 --> 12:13.346
a pencil down my mouth

12:13.413 --> 12:16.482
to keep me from swallowin'
my tongue, man.

12:16.550 --> 12:18.852
On the other hand,
I‐I do love money, so

12:18.919 --> 12:20.654
I'll tell you what,
y'all work on the prototype

12:20.721 --> 12:21.788
and I'll work on the pitch.

12:21.855 --> 12:22.956
[chuckles]

12:23.023 --> 12:24.224
Alright.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.727
Did you really have to wear
your aunt's clothes?

12:26.793 --> 12:28.729
Well, I didn't have to.

12:37.137 --> 12:39.072
I still can't believe
you're not gonna say anything

12:39.139 --> 12:40.306
to Darryl about this.

12:40.373 --> 12:42.442
Synclaire, they're meant
for each other.

12:42.509 --> 12:44.611
He's a giver. She's a taker.

‐ Alright.

12:55.055 --> 12:56.256
Where do we put the gifts?

12:56.322 --> 12:58.091
Oh, I'll put them in the office.
Where did you get them?

12:58.158 --> 13:00.601
Imported crystal
salt and pepper shakers.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.603
Oh. And you, Max?

13:02.669 --> 13:03.904
