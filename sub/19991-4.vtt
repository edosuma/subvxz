get to sleep?

01:53.679 --> 01:56.880
Will you two psychopaths
keep it down?

01:56.882 --> 01:58.248
- Oh, hi, Squidward.
How ya doing?

01:58.250 --> 02:02.719
- Horrible!
I haven't slept for three days.

02:02.721 --> 02:04.387
- Hey, that's great!

02:04.389 --> 02:05.889
- It is not great.

02:06.825 --> 02:07.691
I've got an audition

02:07.693 --> 02:09.993
with the Bikini Bottom
Philharmonic Orchestra

02:09.995 --> 02:13.897
tomorrow morning,
and I'm a nervous wreck.

02:13.899 --> 02:15.465
- Why don't you
try taking a walk?

02:15.467 --> 02:17.234
Works for me.
- You know, normally,

02:17.236 --> 02:20.303
I jump up and scream
when you appear like that.

02:20.305 --> 02:23.507
But I'm so tired,
I'm just gonna take

02:23.509 --> 02:26.643
your stupid advice.

02:29.847 --> 02:31.848
- No, Patrick, no!

02:32.951 --> 02:34.784
- We've got to keep it quiet.

02:36.255 --> 02:38.855
- Tell my parents
I love them.

02:38.857 --> 02:39.856
- Ahh!

02:44.562 --> 02:46.530
Hit the dirt!

02:56.608 --> 02:59.042
That was sheer beauty.

02:59.044 --> 03:03.713
- Taking a walk...walk...

03:03.715 --> 03:06.383
walk.

03:18.897 --> 03:21.565
Home.

03:30.475 --> 03:34.678
- SpongeBob?
What's happening?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.713
- I don't know.

03:40.686 --> 03:42.819
- Ahh!

03:46.458 --> 03:48.425
- Aw, poor guy
was just sleepy.

03:48.427 --> 03:50.694
Looks like we're
gonna be here a while.

03:50.696 --> 03:52.095
See you in the morning, Patrick.

03:52.097 --> 03:57.500
- Oh, yeah.
I should probably...

04:02.908 --> 04:06.409
- Aww.

04:06.411 --> 04:07.477
Aww.

04:20.926 --> 04:24.561
This isn't my rug!
Where--where am I?

04:24.563 --> 04:25.195
Who am I?

04:25.197 --> 04:26.896
Who am I?

04:26.898 --> 04:28.431
How am I?
- Patrick, Patrick, calm down.

04:28.433 --> 04:32.135
You're at my house.
Oh, and that is your rug.

04:32.137 --> 04:34.104
- Oh, yeah.

04:34.106 --> 04:36.906
Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie.

04:36.908 --> 04:39.042
Ruggie, Ruggie,
Ruggie.

04:39.044 --> 04:42.145
- Squidward, time to wake up.

04:42.147 --> 04:44.748
Wake up, little Squidward.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.116
Patrick,
Squidward won't wake up.

04:46.118 --> 04:49.819
- Ruggie, Ruggie,
Ruggie, Ruggie!

04:49.821 --> 04:52.422
Wake up, little Squidward,

04:52.424 --> 04:53.790
wake up!

04:53.792 --> 04:55.425
- Maybe we should
get him up.

04:55.427 --> 04:57.727
Wake up, wake up,

04:57.729 --> 04:59.529
wake up, wake up!

05:06.004 --> 05:07.671
Wake up!

05:11.410 --> 05:12.509
Wake up!

05:12.511 --> 05:14.577
- Patrick, this is bad.

05:14.579 --> 05:15.712
Squidward won't make
his audition

05:15.714 --> 05:18.048
with the Philharmonic Orchestra.
What can we do?

05:18.050 --> 05:23.119
- Oh, we'll have to create
another Squidward in a lab.

05:23.121 --> 05:25.455
- Patrick, you are a genius!

05:46.644 --> 05:47.777
- Eureka!

05:47.779 --> 05:49.846
- No, Patrick.
It didn't work.

05:49.848 --> 05:54.184
- Ooh, we've tried everything
under the ocean,

05:54.186 --> 05:55.919
and we failed.

05:55.921 --> 05:59.055
If only we could just
crawl up inside Squidward

05:59.057 --> 06:00.824
and play him like a puppet.

06:00.826 --> 06:02.225
- That's it!
We could crawl up

06:02.227 --> 06:05.128
inside Squidward
and play him like a puppet!

06:05.130 --> 06:08.498
- Oh, whose dumb idea was that?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.032
- Yours.

06:09.034 --> 06:11.468
- Well, it sounds good to me.

06:11.736 --> 06:13.570
- Okay, Patrick, you go in first

06:13.572 --> 06:14.537
and control his arms and legs.

06:14.539 --> 06:16.673
Then I'll go in
and control the brain.

06:16.675 --> 06:17.640
- Okay.

06:20.579 --> 06:22.512
Eww.

06:23.181 --> 06:24.948
It tickles.

06:24.950 --> 06:25.915
- How's that feel, buddy?

06:25.917 --> 06:30.053
- Not bad.
Okay, get on my shoulders.

06:34.759 --> 06:39.229
Okay, Patrick, I'm gonna see
if I can make Squidward talk.

06:39.997 --> 06:42.165
My name is Squidward,

06:42.167 --> 06:45.702
and I think SpongeBob
is a lamebrain.

06:48.273 --> 06:52.008
Wow, you sound more like him
than--

06:52.010 --> 06:53.743
than Squidward.

06:53.745 --> 06:55.745
- All right, Patrick,
we've got a date

06:55.747 --> 06:57.881
at the Bikini Bottom
Philharmonic.

06:57.883 --> 06:58.982
Let's get going.

06:58.984 --> 07:02.585
Whoa, whoops.

07:02.587 --> 07:05.021
Watch out.
Take it easy.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.091
- Hey!

07:08.093 --> 07:09.959
- Left foot, right foot.

07:21.039 --> 07:23.907
Whoa!
Excuse me.

07:23.909 --> 07:25.275
Sorry.
- Yeah?

07:32.917 --> 07:33.783
- Pardon me.

07:33.785 --> 07:34.851
- Hey, Twinkle Toes,

07:34.853 --> 07:37.821
you're in a no dancing zone.

07:37.823 --> 07:38.855
Now beat it.

07:42.226 --> 07:44.093
Patrick, I just realized
I don't know

07:44.095 --> 07:45.662
where the concert hall is.

07:47.699 --> 07:50.066
Uh, let's ask someone.

07:50.068 --> 07:50.667
- Whoa!

07:50.669 --> 07:52.135
- Excuse me, ma'am.

07:52.137 --> 07:55.905
I'm looking for
the concert hall.

07:56.307 --> 07:58.274
Whoa!

07:58.276 --> 08:01.211
- Young man, you don't need
a concert hall.

08:01.213 --> 08:03.146
You need a hospital.

08:03.148 --> 08:05.148
- Great Neptune,
you're hideous!

08:05.150 --> 08:07.784
I manage a freak show,
and you're exactly

08:07.786 --> 08:09.319
the kind of act I need.

08:09.321 --> 08:10.653
- Mommy, look.

08:10.655 --> 08:13.289
It's Frankenstein!

08:17.094 --> 08:18.928
- Oh, Patrick!
That bus is going

08:18.930 --> 08:20.129
to the concert hall!

08:29.140 --> 08:30.974
Patrick, do you
have any change?

08:30.976 --> 08:32.876
- One second.

08:35.712 --> 08:40.750
- Hey, I wasn't born yesterday.
That'll be three fares.

08:41.419 --> 08:45.655
Hmm, what some people
won't do to cheat the system.

08:53.231 --> 08:54.898
<i>- And don't come back!</i>

08:54.900 --> 08:58.868
- Oh, man.
That conductor's brutal.

09:02.307 --> 09:03.873
- Whoa!

09:03.875 --> 09:06.042
- Oh, oof!

09:06.243 --> 09:07.944
I was just, oh, um,

09:07.946 --> 09:10.413
the thing is not on the thing.
Oh, uh...

09:10.415 --> 09:13.917
- Who is that imbecile?
- Squidward Tentacles.

09:13.919 --> 09:17.053
Apparently he's
a clarinet player.

09:17.055 --> 09:18.721
- All right,
whenever you're ready.

09:18.723 --> 09:19.856
The clarinet,

09:19.858 --> 09:23.026
where's his clarinet?
- Oh, I got it.

09:23.028 --> 09:24.427
- Ew, why'd you put it there?

09:24.429 --> 09:25.395
- I guess I never actually

09:25.397 --> 09:28.298
thought of the moment
where we'd have to play it.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.366
- Let's see, the ability
to play clarinet

09:30.368 --> 09:32.068
has got to be
in his brain somewhere.

09:32.070 --> 09:35.705
It's just a matter
of squeezing it out.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.345
All right, thank you, next!

09:46.751 --> 09:47.817
Huh?

09:52.457 --> 09:54.190
- He's magnificent.

09:54.192 --> 09:58.227
<i>- What--what's going on here?</i>
<i>Where am I?</i>

09:58.229 --> 09:59.295
<i>I'm at the audition.</i>

09:59.297 --> 10:02.165
<i>I'm playing,</i>
<i>but I'm not in control.</i>

10:02.167 --> 10:06.903
<i>I--I feel like I've been</i>
<i>taken over by something.</i>

10:06.905 --> 10:08.171
- What's going on?

10:08.173 --> 10:10.006
- I don't know what's happening.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.241
I'm losing control!

10:12.243 --> 10:15.011
<i>- Must...gain...</i>

10:15.013 --> 10:15.878
<i>control!</i>

10:15.880 --> 10:19.782
- That's an unusual
playing style, but still.

10:19.784 --> 10:21.484
He sounds magnificent.

10:21.486 --> 10:22.885
- Patrick, I don't think I can

10:22.887 --> 10:24.253
command his brain much longer.

10:24.255 --> 10:25.355
- Me neither, SpongeBob.

10:25.357 --> 10:27.991
<i>- What was that--</i>
<i>SpongeBob? Patrick?</i>

10:27.993 --> 10:31.394
<i>You're inside me?</i>
<i>Oh, how did this happen?</i>

10:31.396 --> 10:32.362
<i>Get out of my mind!</i>

10:32.364 --> 10:35.898
<i>Get out of my body.</i>
<i>Just--just--just get out!</i>

10:47.846 --> 10:48.511
Ta-da.

10:48.513 --> 10:51.948
- Oh, I am going to
lambaste you two.

10:51.950 --> 10:55.518
- You're a wizard.
A magical, musical wizard.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.187
- I--huh? Oh.

10:58.189 --> 10:59.422
- Yes, yes!

10:59.424 --> 11:02.925
Oh, bring us to ecstasy,
maestro.

11:02.927 --> 11:04.994
- I envy you common people.

11:04.996 --> 11:08.131
For you are about to have
the glorious honor

11:08.133 --> 11:11.034
of hearing me play
Gustav Mollusk's

11:11.036 --> 11:14.137
Symphony Number Five
in C sharp minor.

11:14.139 --> 11:18.975
For I am in
complete control.

11:38.229 --> 11:39.562
Hmm? Huh?

12:04.722 --> 12:08.624
- I cannot believe I let you
talk me into this.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.960
- Oh, come now, Mr. Squidward.

12:10.962 --> 12:12.595
Catering is a great way for you

12:12.597 --> 12:14.597
to make a little extra money.

12:14.599 --> 12:16.099
And me to make a lot!

12:21.071 --> 12:23.172
- Any ideas?

12:24.142 --> 12:25.074
How's that?

12:25.076 --> 12:26.476
- Perfect, now get out there

12:26.478 --> 12:29.579
and feed the rest of those kids.

12:31.649 --> 12:33.983
- They all seem so...

12:33.985 --> 12:35.218
full of germs!

12:35.220 --> 12:37.653
- Why, of course
they're full of germs.

12:37.655 --> 12:38.421
They're kids.

12:38.423 --> 12:42.225
Why do you think I'm wearing
this full-body latex covering?

12:42.761 --> 12:46.496
- Okay, I'm going in.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.200
Krabby Patty?
Krabby Patty?

12:52.003 --> 12:53.035
- Ooh, ooh, oh,

12:53.037 --> 12:54.203
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

12:54.205 --> 12:56.572
- You're contaminating the food.

12:56.574 --> 12:58.441
Just pick one.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.750
I've been infected!

13:14.225 --> 13:16.459
- Hey, kids, I'm a--

13:20.799 --> 13:22.732
- No, no, no!

13:22.734 --> 13:24.433
- Hey, I'm not paying you

13:24.435 --> 13:25.468
to play hide-and-seek.

13:25.470 --> 13:28.437
These children
want to be entertained.

13:28.439 --> 13:29.739
Get down here.

13:31.543 --> 13:35.211
- I want a balloon animal.

13:38.682 --> 13:40.616
- Uh, um.

13:49.626 --> 13:52.428
- What is it?
- A rock.

13:52.430 --> 13:53.462
- Whoa!

13:53.464 --> 13:55.364
- Okay, birthday boy.

13:55.366 --> 13:58.467
Take a swing
at that piñata, son.

14:00.505 --> 14:01.470
- Oof.

14:03.074 --> 14:05.775
Don't hit nice old Mr. Krabs.

14:05.777 --> 14:09.245
It's the piñata you want, son.

14:12.750 --> 14:13.416
- Me money!

14:13.418 --> 14:16.853
Do I look like
a piñata to you, boy?

14:16.855 --> 14:19.255
- Yes, get him!

14:29.868 --> 14:32.301
Higher!
Go higher!

14:34.472 --> 14:39.342
Uh, don't forget to take
your shoes off before bouncing.

14:42.246 --> 14:43.846
- Ow!

14:44.582 --> 14:45.882
We have to
get out of here.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.884
These children are menaces.

14:47.886 --> 14:50.353
- They tore off my head.

14:51.522 --> 14:54.190
Maybe we should make
a break for it, Mr. Krabs.

14:54.192 --> 14:55.791
- I want my birthday cake.

14:56.828 --> 14:58.160
- Cake, cake!

14:59.530 --> 15:02.231
- Come on, men, let's cheese it!

15:06.471 --> 15:08.771
- Oh, my, are you
the high-class caterers

15:08.773 --> 15:12.441
I hired for an extraordinarily
large sum of money?

15:12.443 --> 15:13.809
- Yes!
- No!

15:13.811 --> 15:15.244
- Yes.

15:15.246 --> 15:17.179
- No!

15:17.181 --> 15:18.281
- Yes.

15:18.283 --> 15:21.717
- I do not have time
for this tomfoolery.

15:21.719 --> 15:25.721
I have a mansion
full of very high-class guests

15:25.723 --> 15:28.190
waiting for very
high-class catering.

15:28.192 --> 15:30.927
Are you they
or are you nay?

15:30.929 --> 15:36.265
- Indubitably, madam.
We are your high-class caterers.

15:36.267 --> 15:38.401
- But where are your tuxedos?

15:38.403 --> 15:41.404
- Tuxedos?
Oh, just give us a moment

15:41.406 --> 15:43.339
to suit up, me good lady.

15:43.341 --> 15:46.709
- Now, where are we going
to get tuxedos from?

15:46.711 --> 15:48.644
- You.
- Hey, what are you--

15:52.649 --> 15:53.249
Ew.

15:53.251 --> 15:55.818
- Ready to serve you,
Miss Money Bags--

15:55.820 --> 15:57.286
er, I--I mean, ma'am.

15:57.288 --> 16:01.257
- Very nice.
Here is your payment.

16:05.196 --> 16:07.330
- Mr. Krabs, you can't
take that check.

16:07.332 --> 16:09.465
We're not high-class caterers.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.534
- We are anything we need to be

16:11.536 --> 16:14.270
for me to make this money.

16:15.238 --> 16:19.208
Unless you wanna go back
to the kids' party.

16:23.214 --> 16:23.746
No!

16:23.748 --> 16:24.780
- That's what I thought.

16:24.782 --> 16:27.583
Then start setting up inside.

16:29.687 --> 16:33.389
- This place
is so shiny.

16:33.391 --> 16:34.623
- Yeah, and so are the people.

16:34.625 --> 16:37.626
- Oh, there's no way
these people are gonna think

16:37.628 --> 16:39.962
our junk food is high class.

16:39.964 --> 16:41.297
- Hmm, you might be right.

16:41.299 --> 16:44.633
SpongeBob, go find something
to fancy-up the food.

16:44.635 --> 16:46.535
- Fancy.
Got it, Mr. Krabs.

16:46.537 --> 16:51.707
- Good, now I'll just get
the lay of the land around here.

16:51.709 --> 16:53.009
- I want my birthday cake!

16:53.011 --> 16:54.310
- Great Neptune's ghost!

16:54.312 --> 16:56.545
- I want my cake!
I want my cake!

16:56.547 --> 17:00.316
- Hey, kid, easy, easy.
Just calm down, will ya?

17:00.318 --> 17:02.752
I got your cake.
- You did?

17:02.754 --> 17:04.353
- Yeah, yeah.

17:04.355 --> 17:05.387
Your birthday cake

17:05.390 --> 17:07.823
is right through here.

17:07.825 --> 17:10.792
- Where?
I don't see any--

17:12.463 --> 17:14.997
Won't be seeing him again
any time soon.

17:15.933 --> 17:18.534
- I. Want. My.

17:18.536 --> 17:20.970
Birthday. Cake!

17:22.373 --> 17:24.839
- I want my birthday cake!

17:28.646 --> 17:30.913
- What do you think
of this, Mr. Krabs?

17:30.915 --> 17:33.949
I call it "Krabby Pâté."

17:33.951 --> 17:34.984
Classy, huh?

17:34.986 --> 17:36.919
Serve it while it's hot,
Patrick.

17:36.921 --> 17:40.489
- SpongeBob, were those
jewels on the patties?

17:40.491 --> 17:42.391
- Yeah. You said
"Fancy-up the food,"

17:42.393 --> 17:44.660
so I found some
shiny stuff for garnish.

17:44.662 --> 17:46.629
Got a whole box.
- What the--

17:46.631 --> 17:48.030
SpongeBob, you can't

17:48.032 --> 17:51.300
just go around taking
people's precious jewels!

17:51.302 --> 17:52.435
- Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.

17:52.437 --> 17:54.403
I was just doing
what you told me.

17:54.972 --> 17:56.839
Don't worry about it.
Just tell me

17:56.841 --> 17:58.541
where you got them gems from.

17:58.543 --> 17:59.542
- Oh, upstairs.

17:59.544 --> 18:01.911
I went left, then right,
then double and triple right,

18:01.913 --> 18:03.813
then down, up, and right
18 more times.

18:03.815 --> 18:05.481
Then do four somersaults,
a barrel roll,

18:05.483 --> 18:08.584
jump backwards twice,
spin till you get sick...

18:08.586 --> 18:11.320
And you're there.

18:11.788 --> 18:14.824
- Okay.
- Fancy foods!

18:14.826 --> 18:17.960
Get your fancy foods here!

18:21.332 --> 18:22.331
Delicious.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.734
- I love delicious stuff.
My turn!

18:28.439 --> 18:30.573
Yummy.

18:31.408 --> 18:33.342
- I'll take a slice of that.

18:33.344 --> 18:34.343
- Mine!

18:34.879 --> 18:36.946
- Ouch!

18:42.385 --> 18:43.519
- Who wants food?

18:43.521 --> 18:46.455
I'm a mindless drone
with food.

18:46.457 --> 18:49.391
Working for the man.
Huh?

18:52.864 --> 18:54.563
- Ooh.

18:55.533 --> 18:56.732
- Here you go, princess.

19:00.438 --> 19:01.937
- Whoa!

19:01.939 --> 19:04.840
- Let's do this thing.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.610
Hey, where you going?

19:09.080 --> 19:09.979
Oh, down here.

19:11.082 --> 19:13.983
I never heard
of a marching quintet.

19:13.985 --> 19:14.917
Uh, wait for me.

19:14.919 --> 19:17.386
Wait, wait, wait, wait for me.
Wait, wait--

19:18.556 --> 19:20.523
Hey, hey!

19:21.292 --> 19:23.459
- All right, what did he say?

19:23.461 --> 19:27.530
18 rights,
then four lefts, or five?

19:27.532 --> 19:28.063
Ooh.

19:28.065 --> 19:29.098
- I want my birthday cake!

19:29.100 --> 19:31.534
Oh, you--get off.

19:31.536 --> 19:32.568
Enough of this.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.971
- If you don't get me my
birthday cake, I'll set off...

19:35.973 --> 19:38.440
- All these fireworks.

19:38.442 --> 19:39.575
- Give me those.

19:39.577 --> 19:40.509
Young boy like yourself

19:40.511 --> 19:42.545
shouldn't be playing
with fireworks.

19:42.547 --> 19:44.113
They're too dangerous.

19:44.115 --> 19:48.817
- Gosh, no one ever cared
enough about me to explain that.

19:48.819 --> 19:52.087
It's like you're
my real father.

19:52.089 --> 19:54.523
May I hug you?

19:55.025 --> 19:55.891
- Ooh.

19:55.893 --> 19:56.659
<i>- Mr. Krabs?</i>

19:56.661 --> 19:59.528
Oh, uh, quick, in here.

19:59.530 --> 20:03.866
- Why, father?
Why?

20:03.868 --> 20:05.501
<i>- Mr. Krabs?</i>

20:05.503 --> 20:06.602
- Um, yes, ma'am?

20:06.604 --> 20:09.905
<i>- Mr. Krabs, we seem</i>
<i>to be having some problems</i>

20:09.907 --> 20:12.141
<i>with the food service.</i>

20:12.143 --> 20:14.810
- Mine, mine!

20:14.812 --> 20:15.911
- Mine, mine!

20:15.913 --> 20:18.480
- Uh, I'll be right down
to have a look.

20:18.482 --> 20:20.983
Just need to
find something here.

20:20.985 --> 20:21.850
All right, where was I?

20:21.852 --> 20:26.522
Four somersaults
and a barrel roll, I think.

20:35.166 --> 20:35.931
- Patrick, no.

20:35.933 --> 20:37.866
The food is for the guests.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.006
- What the--?

20:44.775 --> 20:46.208
- So then, I was all like--

20:46.210 --> 20:49.245
Oof.
Well, I never.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.213
- Food fight!

20:56.721 --> 20:58.554
- Oh, my.

20:58.556 --> 21:00.256
- Whoa.

21:00.258 --> 21:02.224
This must be the place.

21:02.226 --> 21:05.027
Hello?
Ooh.

21:05.029 --> 21:05.828
Ooh-ee.

21:05.830 --> 21:10.032
That is one big--
water bed?

21:10.034 --> 21:11.567
- Birthday cake!
- Dogfish.

21:11.569 --> 21:13.269
- Hi, Daddy!
- Don't call me that.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.104
And stop jumping
on that water bed.

21:15.106 --> 21:16.272
You'll pop it.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.874
- Okay, Daddy.

21:18.876 --> 21:20.576
- Get over here.

21:20.578 --> 21:22.244
Why, you little--
- Hah, Daddy!

21:22.246 --> 21:24.847
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:24.849 --> 21:27.683
- Uh-oh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:30.021 --> 21:31.186
- Stop it, everyone!

21:31.188 --> 21:34.890
You're ruining my par--

21:34.892 --> 21:38.627
Oh, no, you did not.

21:41.599 --> 21:44.133
- Barrel roll,
four somersaults.

21:45.002 --> 21:48.671
Look out, flood's a-coming!

21:49.607 --> 21:51.640
- Nice doing business with you.

21:51.642 --> 21:53.642
- Come back here!

21:55.780 --> 21:57.079
- Huh?

22:04.288 --> 22:06.021
Whoa!

22:10.094 --> 22:10.893
Oh, no.

22:13.897 --> 22:16.265
Ooh.

22:26.944 --> 22:28.077
My cake!

22:28.079 --> 22:29.345
- My check!

22:29.347 --> 22:31.780
- My party!
