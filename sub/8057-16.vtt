00:01.173 --> 00:03.075
Rent-A-Swag shareholders:

00:03.173 --> 00:07.075
As you can see,
your store is hoppin'.

00:07.110 --> 00:08.276
These kids are renting
my old clothes

00:08.294 --> 00:09.428
like they're going
out of style.

00:09.462 --> 00:10.712
Which they never will.

00:10.730 --> 00:12.480
Yeah, it's a lot
of foot traffic, Tommy.

00:12.498 --> 00:13.982
I like it.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.450
Oh, "day-yay-yam,"

00:15.468 --> 00:17.419
it is kind of
a sausage party in here.

00:17.437 --> 00:18.954
For the record,

00:18.988 --> 00:22.674
would hit it, would hit,
would hit.

00:22.725 --> 00:23.825
Hard pass.

00:23.860 --> 00:27.145
Tom, who is this... person?

00:27.180 --> 00:28.714
This is
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,

00:28.748 --> 00:29.948
my new sales associate.

00:29.999 --> 00:32.934
Mona-Lisa Saperstein?

00:32.968 --> 00:35.770
- Does that mean--
- ♪ Oh, yeah

00:35.788 --> 00:36.989
she's my sister.

00:37.023 --> 00:38.724
My twin sister,
from the same mister.

00:38.775 --> 00:40.792
Thank you so much
for hiring Mona-Lisa.

00:40.827 --> 00:41.843
It means so much to me.

00:41.878 --> 00:43.428
Even though,
honestly, she's...

00:43.479 --> 00:45.430
♪ The wo-o-orst.

00:45.481 --> 00:46.848
She is the worst person
in the world.

00:46.866 --> 00:48.033
Huge skank.
Terrible.

00:48.067 --> 00:49.785
But thank you.
It means a lot.

00:49.819 --> 00:51.536
Of course. Got to keep it
in the family.

00:51.571 --> 00:53.839
Yeah, but does it have to be
<i>this</i> family?

00:53.873 --> 00:55.290
Actually, that reminds me,

00:55.308 --> 00:56.625
Ba-ba-ba-boss man...

00:56.659 --> 00:57.826
I need to leave early today

00:57.860 --> 00:59.444
because my shrink
got me and him tickets

00:59.479 --> 01:01.513
to a Pitbull concert.

01:01.547 --> 01:03.165
And I already committed
to that.

01:03.199 --> 01:04.783
And so if you say
that I can't go,

01:04.816 --> 01:06.885
it's like you're taking
something away from me.

01:06.919 --> 01:08.453
Um, store's really busy.

01:08.488 --> 01:09.571
- I kinda need you to stay.
- Mmhmm.

01:09.605 --> 01:10.872
I totally hear you.

01:10.890 --> 01:12.391
Um, I also don't like
what you're saying.

01:12.425 --> 01:13.792
So if you say no,

01:13.826 --> 01:16.628
I <i>will</i> start a fire
in the bathroom.

01:17.162 --> 01:18.363
Okay, I guess you can go.

01:18.398 --> 01:20.365
Yeah, I know I can.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.516
What did I tell you, huh?

01:21.551 --> 01:25.971
♪ The wo-o-o-orst.

01:26.005 --> 01:27.389
She's the worst
in the world.

01:27.423 --> 01:29.041
Jean-Ralphio.

01:49.228 --> 01:50.345
Hello.

01:50.379 --> 01:51.813
Welcome to Pawnee Videodome.

01:51.848 --> 01:53.181
Today we'll be screening

01:53.216 --> 01:56.635
Stanley Kubrick's 1957 classic
<i>Paths Of Glory.</i>

01:56.669 --> 01:59.337
It's about three men who refuse
to go on a suicide mission

01:59.372 --> 02:01.239
and are executed for cowardice.

02:01.274 --> 02:03.208
Or we could, you know,
maybe screen a different movie.

02:03.259 --> 02:04.976
One that's
a little bit more upbeat.

02:05.027 --> 02:06.394
Like <i>Finding Nemo</i> or...

02:06.429 --> 02:08.330
I could do, uh,<i>Shoah.</i>

02:08.364 --> 02:10.931
Okay,<i>Paths Of Glory</i> it is.

02:10.966 --> 02:12.584
This is the Pawnee Videodome.

02:12.618 --> 02:13.919
And we are here

02:13.970 --> 02:15.487
because I started a program
to help local business.

02:15.521 --> 02:17.389
This is a Pawnee institution.

02:17.423 --> 02:19.274
This is the place
where Perd Hapley

02:19.308 --> 02:22.210
shot his movie review show
<i>Lights, Camera, Perd.</i>

02:22.228 --> 02:25.097
It's a heartwarming story,
but it's just not believable.

02:25.131 --> 02:28.166
Which is why
I give <i>E. T.</i> 1 1/2 stars.

02:29.802 --> 02:31.970
Andy, it's over.

02:32.004 --> 02:33.472
Get up, Andy.

02:33.506 --> 02:34.756
What are you doing?

02:34.791 --> 02:35.957
What's everybody--
where are we?

02:35.992 --> 02:37.425
The reason I love that film

02:37.460 --> 02:39.277
is that it's really depressing.

02:39.312 --> 02:41.546
Speaking of which, sadly,
next month,

02:41.597 --> 02:44.082
Pawnee Videodome
will be closing its doors.

02:44.117 --> 02:46.001
- Forever.
- No!

02:46.035 --> 02:48.069
For those of you that
have attended our screenings,

02:48.103 --> 02:49.704
I want to thank you
for your patronage,

02:49.722 --> 02:52.357
though I wish you would have
rented more movies.

02:52.391 --> 02:54.843
Guys, we have to help out
Dennis and his business.

02:54.861 --> 02:56.978
Everybody rent something,
so we can help Dennis.

02:57.013 --> 02:58.112
Sir, will you rent something?

02:58.131 --> 02:59.181
Why would I do that?

02:59.215 --> 03:00.899
All movies are online
for free.

03:00.950 --> 03:02.818
I'm watching <i>Iron Man 2</i>
on my phone right now.

03:02.852 --> 03:04.252
Okay, you're not helping.

03:04.287 --> 03:06.671
I, for one, am going to rent
<i>Finding Nemo.</i>

03:06.706 --> 03:08.723
Ooh, we don't carry cartoons.

03:08.758 --> 03:10.675
But if you want a film
about the ocean,

03:10.710 --> 03:12.010
we have a documentary

03:12.061 --> 03:14.146
about the brutality
of Japan's whaling industry.

03:14.197 --> 03:15.914
It's called
<i>Tears Of My Blowhole.</i>

03:15.948 --> 03:17.232
And it's--it's nauseating.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.267
I'll just buy
some red vines.

03:19.302 --> 03:21.603
Oh, we only have
Japanese slime candy

03:21.637 --> 03:23.371
and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls.

03:23.406 --> 03:26.892
Leslie, seriously,
where are we?

03:26.926 --> 03:29.728
All these kids
have fathers

03:29.762 --> 03:31.780
and mothers
who have birthed them

03:31.814 --> 03:33.849
and are guiding them
through life.

03:34.383 --> 03:36.718
Yep, that's how it works.

03:36.752 --> 03:37.836
How are you feeling?

03:37.870 --> 03:39.905
Did you make
your dad-cision yet?

03:39.939 --> 03:41.489
I am 100% certain

03:41.524 --> 03:43.925
that I am 0% sure
of what I'm going to do.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.962
Ann Perkins asked me
if I would like to donate sperm,

03:46.996 --> 03:48.146
so she can have a baby.

03:48.181 --> 03:50.448
It's a battle
between my primal desire

03:50.499 --> 03:51.950
to bring a child
into this world

03:51.984 --> 03:53.485
and my paralyzing fear

03:53.519 --> 03:56.671
of negatively affecting
any living thing.

03:56.706 --> 03:58.273
There's $60 missing
from the register.

03:58.307 --> 04:00.125
I think Mona-Lisa's
stealing from me.

04:00.159 --> 04:01.743
Yeah, it is
absolutely Mona-Lisa.

04:01.761 --> 04:03.061
100%.
She's a total klepto.

04:03.095 --> 04:05.313
And nympho and pyro--
all those things.

04:05.331 --> 04:06.531
Okay, as your CFO,

04:06.582 --> 04:08.133
I recommend getting rid
of her immediately.

04:08.184 --> 04:09.968
I'm throwing
a huge cocktail party tomorrow

04:10.002 --> 04:11.152
for all my best clients.

04:11.187 --> 04:12.287
I don't have time
to find someone new.

04:12.321 --> 04:13.688
This sucks.

04:13.723 --> 04:16.007
You know,
when I was in high school,

04:16.041 --> 04:17.192
we had to spend a week

04:17.226 --> 04:18.760
carrying around
a sack of flour,

04:18.793 --> 04:20.028
pretending it was a kid.

04:20.062 --> 04:23.548
Why don't you
make Tom your sack of flour,

04:23.583 --> 04:26.234
see how it feels
to parent him a little?

04:26.252 --> 04:28.620
Ben, that is literally

04:28.654 --> 04:30.372
the greatest idea
in human history.

04:30.406 --> 04:32.540
I heard "sack of flour"
and "high school."

04:32.574 --> 04:34.859
Are you dingdongs making
fake drugs for sophomores?

04:34.894 --> 04:37.295
Because if true,
this guy wants in.

04:37.830 --> 04:40.198
Yeah, just have Mr. Traeger
call me when he gets back in.

04:40.233 --> 04:41.600
Actually, you know what?

04:41.634 --> 04:42.684
Don't tell him that I called.

04:42.718 --> 04:44.069
Just when he gets there,
can you text me

04:44.103 --> 04:45.070
and tell me he's back?

04:45.121 --> 04:46.404
You know what?

04:46.439 --> 04:47.889
Let's just pretend
this didn't happen, okay?

04:47.924 --> 04:49.925
This is Jerry Gergich calling.
Bye.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.776
I have to tell you
a secret.

04:51.811 --> 04:53.461
But if you tell anyone,

04:53.496 --> 04:55.747
I will kill you slowly
with a giant syringe.

04:55.781 --> 04:57.966
Good morning, April.
What's your secret?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.501
I'm thinking about applying
to veterinary school

04:59.535 --> 05:00.735
in Bloomington.

05:00.769 --> 05:02.637
Oh, my God, April,
that's great!

05:02.672 --> 05:04.506
Whoa!
Where'd you get that?

05:04.540 --> 05:06.024
The Internet.

05:06.058 --> 05:08.226
So I really need
a letter of recommendation.

05:08.261 --> 05:09.878
And since you work
in a hospital,

05:09.912 --> 05:11.296
- as a janitor...
- Nurse.

05:11.330 --> 05:15.200
I was wondering if maybe
you would write one for me?

05:15.251 --> 05:16.985
Really?

05:17.019 --> 05:18.019
Generally, between us,

05:18.054 --> 05:20.255
April always has
the upper hand.

05:20.289 --> 05:22.924
And that hand
is usually giving me the finger

05:22.959 --> 05:24.442
or pouring honey
in my purse.

05:24.477 --> 05:26.211
But now I have
the upper hand.

05:26.245 --> 05:27.529
And I'm going to use it

05:27.563 --> 05:29.180
to crush her...

05:29.215 --> 05:31.316
Into being nice
to me.

05:31.350 --> 05:33.685
I would be happy
to write you that letter.

05:33.719 --> 05:34.803
I actually know
the guy who runs

05:34.837 --> 05:36.021
the veterinary program
over there.

05:36.055 --> 05:37.622
Because you hooked up
with him?

05:37.673 --> 05:39.641
I don't hook up
with everyone I know.

05:39.675 --> 05:40.808
Although, yes,
we did hook up.

05:40.826 --> 05:42.243
But before I write you
that letter,

05:42.278 --> 05:44.346
you have to spend
the next week with me

05:44.380 --> 05:45.580
and do everything I say.

05:45.614 --> 05:47.499
So I have to be your slave
or something?

05:47.533 --> 05:49.317
No, you have to be
my friend.

05:49.352 --> 05:51.086
No, that is
so much worse.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.637
Don't do that.

05:52.672 --> 05:54.956
I think I have a plan
of how to save your store.

05:54.991 --> 05:57.375
If we get
the Pawnee Historical Society

05:57.410 --> 05:59.778
to declare your store
as a historical landmark,

05:59.812 --> 06:01.746
then you might get enough
of a tax break

06:01.781 --> 06:02.897
to keep your business afloat.

06:02.932 --> 06:04.265
That sounds
like the government

06:04.299 --> 06:05.984
meddling
in private enterprise.

06:06.035 --> 06:07.919
Well, Ron, we all know

06:07.953 --> 06:09.521
how much you love
the free market.

06:09.555 --> 06:13.074
But the Pawnee Videodome
is the only place in town

06:13.109 --> 06:14.909
where people gather
to do something intellectual.

06:14.944 --> 06:17.896
That and the slam poetry nights
at Beanie's Coffee.

06:17.947 --> 06:18.997
But I do not count those

06:19.031 --> 06:20.432
because those poems
do not rhyme.

06:20.466 --> 06:24.486
Anything can be a slam poem

06:24.520 --> 06:25.787
if you say it like this.

06:25.805 --> 06:27.072
It's pointless.

06:27.106 --> 06:28.623
This man is a failure.

06:28.657 --> 06:30.709
He is not up to snuff.

06:30.743 --> 06:32.743
His business is failing,
and you're bailing it out.

06:32.762 --> 06:34.713
This is a bailout,
and I don't like it.

06:34.747 --> 06:36.664
And there are some pretty
intellectual conversations

06:36.682 --> 06:38.383
down at Barrett's Hardware.

06:38.434 --> 06:40.618
You may get
a little heat for this, okay?

06:40.653 --> 06:42.654
So use
your money wisely.

06:42.688 --> 06:44.889
Get popular films
that people wanna see.

06:44.924 --> 06:46.474
Like, uh,

06:46.492 --> 06:48.727
get the Tarkovsky movies
<i>with</i> the subtitles.

06:48.761 --> 06:50.111
No. Like Pixar.

06:50.146 --> 06:51.379
Reese Witherspoon.

06:51.414 --> 06:52.514
I know this is gonna hurt,

06:52.548 --> 06:53.629
but maybe some Michael Bay.

06:53.632 --> 06:55.700
What? No, no.
No.

06:57.036 --> 06:59.287
Tom, I have something
I need to talk to you about.

06:59.321 --> 07:01.840
- Do we need to sit like this?
- Yes.

07:01.874 --> 07:03.658
Mona-Lisa's taking advantage
of you.

07:03.692 --> 07:05.310
And I'm sure
that it's not easy

07:05.344 --> 07:07.145
when it's the sister
of a dear friend.

07:07.179 --> 07:08.680
Oh, no, it's not that.

07:08.731 --> 07:10.014
She scares the crap
out of me.

07:10.049 --> 07:12.300
I once saw her punch
a police horse in the face.

07:12.334 --> 07:13.952
Speak directly to her

07:13.986 --> 07:17.605
and tell her,
"I will not be disrespected."

07:17.640 --> 07:19.224
You're Tom Haverford.

07:19.275 --> 07:21.793
You're a smart,
successful young man

07:21.827 --> 07:23.728
with an adorable,
little belly.

07:23.763 --> 07:25.180
Stand up for yourself.

07:25.214 --> 07:27.198
Yeah, I'll talk to her
before the party.

07:27.233 --> 07:28.500
And if she murders me,

07:28.551 --> 07:31.552
tell Jean-Ralphio
to clear my browser history.

07:31.570 --> 07:32.904
Thanks for the advice, man.

07:32.938 --> 07:34.722
You're welcome.

07:34.740 --> 07:35.840
Son.

07:35.875 --> 07:36.925
What's that?

07:36.959 --> 07:38.510
- Nothing.
- All right.

07:38.544 --> 07:40.245
Pawnee Videodome

07:40.279 --> 07:42.080
is where I rented
my first Bruce Lee movie.

07:42.114 --> 07:45.033
And my second Bruce Lee movie.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.701
And when I was
in seventh grade,

07:46.735 --> 07:48.686
I went out back
in the alley behind the store,

07:48.737 --> 07:50.989
and there was
a giant hornet's nest.

07:51.023 --> 07:53.658
And I threw a rock at it,
and it exploded.

07:53.692 --> 07:55.860
- And hornets came out.
- Andy-

07:55.911 --> 07:57.245
The point is,

07:57.279 --> 07:58.813
obviously,

07:58.831 --> 08:02.650
you do not throw rocks
at a hornet's nest.

08:02.668 --> 08:04.169
And the point is also

08:04.203 --> 08:06.287
that the Pawnee Videodome
is a place

08:06.321 --> 08:08.256
with tremendous community value,

08:08.290 --> 08:10.341
where people gather
to expand their horizons.

08:10.376 --> 08:12.427
Any other comments here
before we vo--

08:12.461 --> 08:13.878
Ron?

08:13.929 --> 08:15.430
What are you doing
at a city council meeting?

08:15.464 --> 08:17.665
Are you lost?
Are you hurt?

08:17.683 --> 08:19.551
No, I am here
to express an opinion.

08:19.602 --> 08:22.020
This action
by Councilwoman Knope

08:22.054 --> 08:23.238
is nothing more

08:23.272 --> 08:25.356
than a thinly veiled
government bailout.

08:25.391 --> 08:28.393
And I, for one, refuse
to let her turn this town

08:28.444 --> 08:30.228
into a socialist hellscape.

08:30.279 --> 08:31.679
Allow me to elaborate.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.679
The government should not
prop up a failed business.

08:36.804 --> 08:39.956
That would be like giving food
to a mortally wounded animal

08:39.974 --> 08:41.457
instead of slitting
its throat

08:41.476 --> 08:43.460
and properly utilizing
its meat and pelt.

08:43.494 --> 08:46.196
Please stop talking
about wounded meat.

08:46.230 --> 08:49.432
Pawnee needs a place
where the community can gather

08:49.467 --> 08:51.084
to discuss
and appreciate art.

08:51.119 --> 08:54.221
A place where you can rent
such films as <i>Cinema Paradiso</i>

08:54.255 --> 08:56.072
or <i>Rashomon.</i>

08:56.106 --> 08:57.224
You rented <i>Rashomon?</i>

08:57.258 --> 08:59.192
What was your favorite part
of that?

08:59.227 --> 09:00.794
I haven't rented it,
actually, yet.

09:00.828 --> 09:03.046
But I like the idea
that there is a place

09:03.080 --> 09:05.031
where I could rent <i>Rashomon.</i>

09:05.066 --> 09:07.033
Uh, you can
just watch it online,

09:07.084 --> 09:08.635
for free,
whenever you want.

09:08.669 --> 09:09.719
Bailiff!

09:09.754 --> 09:11.121
Thank you, Mr. Swanson,

09:11.155 --> 09:13.756
for your absurd opinion,
which is shared by no one.

09:13.774 --> 09:15.609
Now, are there
any more public comments

09:15.643 --> 09:18.645
before we vote?
Mm.

09:18.679 --> 09:20.430
How much to rent
this jacket?

09:20.464 --> 09:23.283
Oh. Curly Sue,
that jacket is so ugly.

09:23.317 --> 09:24.400
You should just take it.

09:24.418 --> 09:25.785
It's 15 for the day,

09:25.837 --> 09:26.920
40 for the week.

09:26.954 --> 09:28.171
Thank you.

09:28.189 --> 09:29.523
We appreciate your business.

09:29.557 --> 09:31.041
Mona-Lisa!

09:31.075 --> 09:32.576
Did you order the champagne
for the client party tonight?

09:32.610 --> 09:35.328
Did I order the what
for the what-what what, what?

09:35.363 --> 09:37.631
What are you even talking about
right now?

09:37.682 --> 09:39.432
Okay, we need
to discuss your work habits.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.518
Okay, sure,
but after I take a quick nap

09:41.552 --> 09:44.070
because ecstasy takes

09:44.121 --> 09:46.373
♪ forever to leave my system

09:46.424 --> 09:49.225
No. We're doing this now.

09:49.243 --> 09:50.877
You need to start putting in
more of an effort

09:50.912 --> 09:52.646
and start respecting
my authority around here!

09:52.680 --> 09:53.630
Or else what?

09:53.648 --> 09:55.982
Or else I'll fire you.

09:56.033 --> 09:57.300
What did you just say?

09:57.335 --> 09:59.369
I said, if you don't shape up,
I'll fire you.

09:59.387 --> 10:00.487
Do you understand?

10:01.021 --> 10:03.073
You are so freaking sexy
right now,

10:03.107 --> 10:04.124
I could crap my pants.

10:04.158 --> 10:05.959
Ugh.

10:06.010 --> 10:07.243
What are you doing?

10:08.346 --> 10:09.980
I guess
it would have to be

10:10.014 --> 10:11.464
Channing Tatum's body,

10:11.499 --> 10:13.400
Ryan Gosling's face,

10:13.434 --> 10:16.920
and Michael Fassbender's...
sense of humor.

10:16.954 --> 10:18.188
What about you?

10:18.222 --> 10:19.188
Build your perfect guy.

10:19.207 --> 10:20.156
Um...

10:20.174 --> 10:21.758
Yao Ming's torso,

10:21.976 --> 10:23.243
Napoleon's brain,

10:23.277 --> 10:25.812
and The Hunchback
of Notre Dame's hunchback.

10:25.846 --> 10:26.947
Do you like my nails?

10:27.681 --> 10:29.032
Even though she hides it

10:29.050 --> 10:31.668
underneath layers of sarcasm,
resentment, and grumpiness,

10:31.702 --> 10:33.587
I know,
deep down somewhere,

10:33.638 --> 10:35.138
April likes me.

10:35.172 --> 10:37.474
I'm kind of just fracking
for friendship.

10:37.508 --> 10:40.443
Gene Strackwell,
owner of Strackwell Hardware.

10:40.478 --> 10:43.163
Is there a form I need
to fill out for the bailout?

10:43.197 --> 10:45.265
We're not bailing anyone out.

10:45.299 --> 10:48.919
Pawnee Videodome is receiving
historical landmark status.

10:48.953 --> 10:50.070
We've been around
way longer

10:50.104 --> 10:52.188
than that stupid
art house movie bullcrap.

10:52.223 --> 10:55.025
And people need places
to buy tools.

10:55.059 --> 10:56.626
Uh, you can
just buy tools online.

10:56.661 --> 10:57.944
Bailiff, why is he back
in here?

10:57.979 --> 10:59.262
How did you get back in here?

10:59.296 --> 11:00.664
I'll see myself out.
Don't worry about it.

11:00.698 --> 11:02.532
I heard you were giving out
free money.

11:02.550 --> 11:04.167
I need $3,000.

11:04.485 --> 11:05.302
Minimum.

11:05.336 --> 11:07.170
Mr. Fantringham,
the city of Pawnee

11:07.204 --> 11:08.455
is not gonna give you
a personal loan.

11:08.489 --> 11:10.407
What would you do
if one of your citizens

11:10.441 --> 11:12.909
was about to come into
some serious physical harm...

11:12.944 --> 11:15.228
Unless he got $3,000?

11:15.263 --> 11:16.496
I'd call the police.

11:16.547 --> 11:18.715
You cannot call
the police.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.651
Wilson Gromling
of the "Liberty or Die" party.

11:21.686 --> 11:24.254
These government handouts
are deplorable.

11:24.288 --> 11:25.905
You're just handing out
blank checks.

11:25.940 --> 11:27.090
I was on food stamps.

11:27.124 --> 11:28.341
I was on Welfare.

11:28.392 --> 11:29.643
And nobody ever helped me.

11:29.677 --> 11:31.378
This is not
a blank check.

11:31.412 --> 11:33.313
I have given
specific instructions

11:33.347 --> 11:34.564
to the Pawnee Videodome

11:34.598 --> 11:36.249
about how they are going
to spend their money.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.585
In a few days,
Dennis will reopen.

11:38.619 --> 11:40.537
The store will serve
a wider range

11:40.571 --> 11:41.972
of Pawnee's citizens,

11:42.006 --> 11:45.542
and a Pawnee cultural
institution will be saved.

11:45.576 --> 11:47.394
- Are there any other comments?
- Yes.

11:47.428 --> 11:50.447
The Pawnee chapter
of the "Liberty or Die" party

11:50.481 --> 11:51.881
has hit some hard times.

11:51.915 --> 11:53.216
We were wondering

11:53.250 --> 11:55.752
if maybe the town
could loan us some money.

11:55.786 --> 11:57.470
Mmhmm.

11:58.505 --> 12:00.607
Tom, how did it go
with Mona-Lisa?

12:00.658 --> 12:02.625
I told her she needed
to change her attitude,

12:02.660 --> 12:04.661
or I was gonna have
to fire her.

12:04.695 --> 12:07.480
Well, that is very responsible
and mature.

12:07.515 --> 12:08.648
She took it well?

12:08.683 --> 12:11.051
Um... yeah.

12:11.085 --> 12:13.903
For some reason,
she got super turned on.

12:13.938 --> 12:16.456
We started making out.
Hard.

12:16.490 --> 12:18.158
Next thing you know,
we're back at my place,

12:18.192 --> 12:19.559
having sex.

12:20.093 --> 12:21.177
We're together now.

12:21.211 --> 12:23.146
Hey, bitch, I need
to borrow some money

12:23.180 --> 12:25.281
to do something that
is none of your damn beeswax,

12:25.316 --> 12:28.384
namely, I need to wax my bee.

12:28.402 --> 12:29.352
Here you go.

12:29.387 --> 12:31.037
I'd still hit it.

12:31.088 --> 12:32.422
I'm coolin' on you.

12:32.956 --> 12:36.026
See? Perfect!

12:36.060 --> 12:37.911
Okay,
you have to choose one.

12:37.962 --> 12:39.229
I can't think.

12:39.263 --> 12:41.581
These braids you did
are making my brain hurt.

12:41.985 --> 12:43.616
Fine. Miranda.

12:43.667 --> 12:44.968
No, I think
you're a Charlotte.

12:45.002 --> 12:47.053
You're like
a scary Charlotte.

12:47.088 --> 12:48.338
Hey.

12:48.372 --> 12:49.973
Hey, you.

12:50.507 --> 12:52.575
What's--
what's up?

12:53.109 --> 12:54.310
Nothin'.

12:55.045 --> 12:56.129
This is weird.

12:56.130 --> 12:57.397
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

12:57.431 --> 12:58.752
- Why is it weird?
- It's not weird.

12:58.783 --> 13:00.967
Do you want
to talk in private?

13:01.001 --> 13:02.752
No, anything you can say
to Ann, you can say to me

13:02.770 --> 13:04.804
because we're best friends
this week.

13:04.839 --> 13:05.939
Ccan we talk later?

13:05.973 --> 13:06.956
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:06.990 --> 13:08.258
Why don't you talk now?

13:08.292 --> 13:09.659
- No, talk to you later.
- Chris, we can talk now.

13:09.677 --> 13:11.544
- What's going on, best friend?
- Nothing, never mind.

13:11.579 --> 13:12.979
- Tell me.
- Nothing's happening.

13:13.013 --> 13:14.414
Back to forced friendship.

13:14.448 --> 13:15.569
Hey, let's go
put on our pj's

13:15.583 --> 13:17.517
and make White Russians.
So fun.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.320
Councilwoman.

13:20.371 --> 13:21.638
I just came down

13:21.672 --> 13:23.523
to see the effects
of your government intervention,

13:23.557 --> 13:24.974
and I've got to hand it
to you--

13:24.992 --> 13:26.793
You really turned
this place around.

13:27.827 --> 13:28.728
Really?

13:29.263 --> 13:31.314
Oh, my God,
this is amazing, Dennis.

13:31.348 --> 13:32.532
- Hey.
- You did it!

13:32.566 --> 13:34.701
We did it!
I did it.

13:34.735 --> 13:36.669
- This is me.
- Yes, it was.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.937
I took your advice.

13:37.972 --> 13:40.523
Got rid of all
those dusty, old foreign films

13:40.558 --> 13:41.908
and used the money
for the part of our business

13:41.942 --> 13:43.243
that's always done
pretty well for us.

13:43.277 --> 13:45.161
Give the people
what they want, right?

13:45.196 --> 13:46.356
This isn't
what people want.

13:46.963 --> 13:48.948
It's definitely
what <i>that</i> guy wants.

13:49.499 --> 13:50.733
I like this store now.

13:51.051 --> 13:52.285
Do you realize
what you have done?

13:52.336 --> 13:55.755
The Pawnee government now
effectively owns a porn shop.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.308
You have made us
porn peddlers!

14:04.123 --> 14:06.272
Hello everyone,
I'm Brandi Maxxxx.

14:06.273 --> 14:08.824
Let's give a big round of
applause to Councilwoman Knope

14:08.958 --> 14:10.142
for keeping this store
in business!

14:10.176 --> 14:13.562
No.
Everyone stop applauding.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.414
For the record, I was
just trying to help a place

14:15.448 --> 14:17.532
that had
tremendous cultural value.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.619
Leslie, you've always been
a huge supporter of my work.

14:20.670 --> 14:22.171
No, no, I haven't.

14:22.205 --> 14:23.705
So I'm thrilled
to tell you

14:23.723 --> 14:25.724
that I'm playing Leslie Knope

14:25.759 --> 14:27.192
in the porn version
of the story

14:27.227 --> 14:28.761
of this government bailout!

14:28.812 --> 14:30.479
Please don't do that.

14:30.513 --> 14:32.531
- Oh, we already filmed it.
- Oh!

14:32.582 --> 14:34.433
The porn industry in town
was really faltering.

14:34.484 --> 14:35.884
But now we're back.

14:35.919 --> 14:37.202
You're our hero!

14:37.253 --> 14:39.855
Oh!

14:39.889 --> 14:42.107
Okay.
Are you ready?

14:42.158 --> 14:43.892
For you to tell me
what's going on with Chris? Yes.

14:43.927 --> 14:45.294
No.

15:34.210 --> 15:36.695
♪ if you fall,
I will catch you ♪

15:36.746 --> 15:38.881
♪ oh, I'll be waiting

15:38.915 --> 15:41.350
♪ time after time

15:41.384 --> 15:43.435
♪ time after time

15:43.470 --> 15:46.521
♪ time after time.

15:48.758 --> 15:50.843
This never happened.

15:52.595 --> 15:54.897
I made everything worse.

15:54.931 --> 15:56.281
If Tom were a bag of flour,

15:56.316 --> 15:57.916
that flour would never grow up

15:57.951 --> 15:59.985
to be a happy,
well-adjusted loaf of bread.

16:00.019 --> 16:01.286
Much less
a bran muffin,

16:01.321 --> 16:03.281
which is the highest honor
that flour can achieve.

16:03.289 --> 16:05.707
Okay, so you're
really gonna say no to Ann?

16:05.742 --> 16:08.327
I care about Ann very deeply,
but...

16:08.361 --> 16:11.163
I just don't know
if I'm cut out to be a dad.

16:11.197 --> 16:14.133
You know, Chris,
every parent makes mistakes.

16:14.167 --> 16:16.285
I mean, lord knows
I've made plenty.

16:16.319 --> 16:19.288
But it's the small victories
that keep you going.

16:19.322 --> 16:22.458
When you see your little one
take her first step

16:22.492 --> 16:24.276
or--or graduate college,

16:24.310 --> 16:25.978
oh, my God, it just makes it
all worth it.

16:27.030 --> 16:29.164
And another thing is if--

16:29.182 --> 16:31.150
If, like--

16:31.184 --> 16:33.568
If I--

16:33.586 --> 16:35.220
You know,
and then your kid's--

16:35.255 --> 16:36.605
because you're like--vrrrr--
I don't know.

16:36.639 --> 16:37.790
And everyone's like,

16:37.824 --> 16:39.258
"Oh."

16:39.292 --> 16:40.476
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

16:40.510 --> 16:42.528
I--no one ever lets me
talk this long.

16:42.562 --> 16:43.645
I just got lost.

16:43.680 --> 16:44.946
It was a beautiful point.

16:44.964 --> 16:46.765
And very well said,
right up until that moment

16:46.800 --> 16:49.034
that you started babbling
incoherently.

16:49.568 --> 16:51.353
And I'll have
the number eight.

16:51.387 --> 16:54.022
That's a party platter.
It serves 12 people.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.390
I know
what I'm about, son.

16:55.925 --> 16:57.792
Go ahead, Ron.
Let me have it.

16:57.811 --> 16:59.060
Oh, wait,
I'll do it for you.

16:59.078 --> 17:00.963
I told you so, Leslie.

17:00.997 --> 17:02.214
This is what happens

17:02.248 --> 17:03.615
when the government interferes
with business.

17:03.650 --> 17:05.317
Government is bad,
business is good.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.553
Free market.

17:07.587 --> 17:09.304
Capitalism
is the only way, Leslie.

17:09.339 --> 17:11.373
It moves
our country forward.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.907
It's what makes
America great.

17:12.925 --> 17:15.694
And England okay
and France terrible.

17:15.728 --> 17:17.945
I like capitalism.
I love competition.

17:17.981 --> 17:19.263
I'm more competitive
than you.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.332
- I don't think so.
- I think so.

17:20.366 --> 17:21.767
- Settle down.
- No, settle up.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.252
'Cause the bill's been paid,
and I've paid it,

17:23.286 --> 17:24.453
and I've won.

17:24.487 --> 17:26.622
Look, the point is
there has to be a way

17:26.656 --> 17:27.739
for the government
to help places

17:27.773 --> 17:28.974
that add community value

17:29.008 --> 17:31.226
but don't necessarily
rake in the money.

17:31.261 --> 17:32.461
There is not.

17:32.995 --> 17:34.263
The free market is a jungle.

17:34.297 --> 17:37.449
It's beautiful and brutal
and should be left alone.

17:37.483 --> 17:39.568
When a business fails,
it dies,

17:39.586 --> 17:41.086
and a new, better one
takes its place.

17:41.137 --> 17:44.690
Just let business be business
and government be government.

17:44.724 --> 17:45.807
Here you go.

17:45.842 --> 17:48.643
And one number eight.

17:48.661 --> 17:50.312
All right, party time.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.581
I would suggest sticking
around and watching him eat it

17:52.615 --> 17:53.749
'cause it only takes
four minutes,

17:53.783 --> 17:54.816
and it's pretty amazing.

17:54.994 --> 17:57.020
These will not
be necessary.

17:59.775 --> 18:01.458
Here is your letter
of recommendation,

18:01.525 --> 18:02.991
so you're off the hook.

18:02.992 --> 18:04.793
No need to pretend
to be my friend anymore.

18:04.828 --> 18:06.729
Thank God.

18:06.763 --> 18:08.397
I can't tell
if you actually hate me

18:08.415 --> 18:09.882
or if this
is just how you are,

18:09.933 --> 18:11.967
but I had fun hanging out
with you.

18:12.002 --> 18:15.187
So I don't care what you say,
you're my friend.

18:15.221 --> 18:16.989
And I hope you get
into veterinary school

18:17.040 --> 18:19.425
because I like you,
so there.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.293
I got you something too.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.262
A baby-naming book.

18:23.396 --> 18:24.863
I hope it works out
with Chris.

18:24.898 --> 18:27.900
And if it doesn't, I hope
it works out with someone.

18:27.951 --> 18:29.034
We're gonna hug now.

18:29.069 --> 18:30.336
- No.
- Yeah.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.604
Ow! You're hurting me!

18:31.638 --> 18:34.523
Mm! Lot of hot "D"
in here tonight.

18:34.557 --> 18:36.575
Ooh, look
at that chunky hunky.

18:36.610 --> 18:37.977
Go over there
and talk to him

18:38.011 --> 18:39.171
and find out
what his deal is.

18:39.179 --> 18:40.946
No, I'm not gonna talk
to some other guy.

18:40.981 --> 18:42.581
When we're together,
you can't check out other guys.

18:42.616 --> 18:43.816
That's the deal.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.200
Or else it's over between us,
you understand?

18:45.218 --> 18:48.220
Mm! Tommy laying down the law.
A little feisty.

18:48.254 --> 18:50.122
I like that, okay?
I'ma go get a soda.

18:50.156 --> 18:51.790
Do you want
to have sex somewhere

18:51.825 --> 18:53.309
after I do that?

18:53.343 --> 18:54.929
- Sure.
- All right.

18:58.763 --> 18:59.832
Well.

18:59.883 --> 19:02.785
Looks like things
with Mona-Lisa are...

19:02.819 --> 19:04.019
Continuing.

19:04.054 --> 19:05.904
Yeah. I think
I'm gradually transforming her

19:05.939 --> 19:07.773
from truly terrible
to only kinda terrible.

19:07.807 --> 19:09.925
It's the small victories,
you know?

19:09.959 --> 19:11.293
Indeed.

19:11.328 --> 19:12.945
The small victories.

19:12.979 --> 19:14.129
I know
she's kind of a monster,

19:14.164 --> 19:15.381
but whatever.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.516
I'm young.
She's sexy.

19:17.550 --> 19:19.084
I'm just gonna see
where this roller coaster goes.

19:19.135 --> 19:20.769
Fair enough.

19:20.803 --> 19:22.655
Is there anything else
you need help with?

19:22.689 --> 19:24.206
Have you learned
how to ride a bike yet?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.791
Yeah.
I'm 28 years old.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.079
I'm proud of you, bud.

19:30.513 --> 19:31.664
Thanks!

19:32.198 --> 19:33.098
Ann Perkins.

19:33.533 --> 19:35.868
Is that
a happy "Ann Perkins,"

19:35.902 --> 19:37.919
or is that
a bad-news "Ann Perkins"?

19:37.937 --> 19:39.254
Oh, happy.
Obviously.

19:39.289 --> 19:40.610
The bad-news one
sounds like this.

19:40.873 --> 19:42.307
"Ann Perkins."

19:42.342 --> 19:43.659
Oh.

19:43.693 --> 19:44.893
Well, I've thought about it.

19:44.928 --> 19:46.061
And I'm in.

19:46.095 --> 19:47.362
I want to be a parent.

19:47.397 --> 19:49.364
I want to raise a child,

19:49.415 --> 19:51.983
with all the ups and downs

19:52.001 --> 19:55.504
and challenges
that comes with it.

19:55.538 --> 19:57.289
Chris, this is so great.

19:57.323 --> 19:59.174
- I'm so happy.
- Me too.

19:59.208 --> 20:02.344
Well, I guess your uter-you
and my uter-me

20:02.378 --> 20:04.212
are now our uter-us.

20:04.263 --> 20:06.031
Don't make me change my mind.

20:06.066 --> 20:09.635
Although we are all sad
and deeply grossed out

20:09.669 --> 20:11.103
that the Pawnee Videodome

20:11.137 --> 20:13.122
is turning
into a porno palace,

20:13.156 --> 20:15.524
I am happy to announce
that the Pawnee government

20:15.542 --> 20:18.660
will be hosting
a weekly movie night

20:18.694 --> 20:20.028
here at the Community Center.

20:20.046 --> 20:22.965
There will be free screenings
followed by a discussion

20:22.999 --> 20:25.334
led by local film buff
Dennis Lerpiss.

20:25.368 --> 20:26.969
Tonight's film is...

20:27.003 --> 20:28.504
<i>The Sound Of Music.</i>

20:29.538 --> 20:31.006
And... action.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.926
I'm glad you're here,
Dong Swanson.

20:33.977 --> 20:36.127
The local video store's
about to go under.

20:36.162 --> 20:37.312
We have to save it.

20:37.347 --> 20:38.547
Oh, this is the wrong movie.

20:38.548 --> 20:39.998
We ne--
shut this down, please.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.784
- Shut it down.
- Sorry, Leslie.

20:42.118 --> 20:43.469
I'm a strict libertarian,

20:43.503 --> 20:45.354
and I don't believe in bailouts.

20:45.388 --> 20:47.122
This is not how it happened.
