WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.337
MAN: I believe what we all
believe in,

00:03.371 --> 00:05.473
and I believe that there is no
higher calling

00:05.506 --> 00:07.075
than that of public service.

00:07.108 --> 00:10.278
(applause)

00:10.311 --> 00:12.313
And where others see
the State Senate

00:12.346 --> 00:14.148
as a steppingstone
to higher office,

00:14.182 --> 00:15.249
let me assure you,

00:15.283 --> 00:18.086
I can see no greater service
to the people I love.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.060
OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

00:26.094 --> 00:28.296
There's a man with a gun
at the Quincy Hotel.

00:31.832 --> 00:35.069
...making California safe
to threats from without

00:35.103 --> 00:36.470
- and within.
- Hey, Bill.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.072
Don. Thanks for
coming, guys.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.440
Chippies are
stretched thin today.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.342
Weyes out there.e

00:41.375 --> 00:42.410
So what's the deal?

00:42.443 --> 00:43.111
Why's the Senator still here
with a death threat?

00:43.144 --> 00:44.011
He wouldn't let us pull him out.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.080
COLBY: So we have absolutely
no control

00:46.114 --> 00:47.615
over who's already been let in.

00:47.648 --> 00:48.416
Let's get the uplink
to my people.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.750
Why don't you guys
hit the floor.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.722
SENATOR: ...by a series of
reforms designed to overturn

00:54.755 --> 00:56.724
30 years of misguided optimism

00:56.757 --> 01:00.428
about the heart of a criminal
and what resides there.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.830
Thank you.

01:02.863 --> 01:07.101
God bless you all and God bless
the great state of California.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.437
All right, guys,
here comes the uplink.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.305
Now.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.840
I'm up.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.510
Yeah, so are we.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.645
I've been waiting

01:17.678 --> 01:20.148
for an opportunity to give
my crowd dynamics program

01:20.181 --> 01:21.149
a shakedown.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.216
Look, if this works,

01:22.250 --> 01:23.851
the security applications
alone are staggering.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.052
It's amazing.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.887
We're getting a real-time
analysis of movement patterns,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.889
ongoing flow rate projections.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.525
We're looking for a male,
one male,

01:31.559 --> 01:32.860
probably with a handgun.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.696
Lot of people in the area.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.431
Hope you guys
can narrow it down.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.733
I'm fishing for body language
and microexpressions,

01:39.767 --> 01:41.335
but with this many people,

01:41.369 --> 01:42.470
it's really just fishing.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.138
Charlie?

01:44.172 --> 01:45.773
Look, the software we're using
is designed

01:45.806 --> 01:47.308
to determine corridor flow,

01:47.341 --> 01:49.810
maximize efficiency
of ingress and egress.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.612
You know, but what's
really interesting here

01:51.645 --> 01:52.680
are the continuum
approximations.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.614
By analyzing the crowd

01:53.647 --> 01:56.784
as if it were
a liquid-like substance...

01:56.817 --> 01:57.585
We're looking
for anomalies,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.453
like someone
breaking the pattern

01:59.487 --> 02:00.854
of the reception line.

02:00.888 --> 02:04.124
Got to get in fast and close
for a shot at the senator.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.607
Thank you. Thank you.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.476
It's a pleasure.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.611
Do you see that?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.712
All right,
we'd better double-check it

02:24.745 --> 02:26.314
against high-density,
bidirectional flow results.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.948
MEGAN:
Charlie, there's a time

02:27.981 --> 02:30.384
for double-checking and a time
to make an educated guess.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.653
Okay, then, we have

02:32.686 --> 02:34.322
an unaccountable congestion
near a center table.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.530
I have a male Asian, 60s,

02:42.563 --> 02:44.532
near the center table.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.200
The body language is right.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.167
He has slumped shoulders
and a slack expression.

02:47.201 --> 02:50.204
He's holding his jacket
with his right hand.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.772
DON:
Bingo. I got him, guys.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.607
- Two o'clock, two o'clock.
- I got him.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.282
(crowd screaming)

03:01.315 --> 03:03.451
FBI! Get down! Move!

03:07.621 --> 03:08.889
Put it down!
Right now!

03:08.922 --> 03:10.658
Don't do that!
Don't do it!

03:20.968 --> 03:22.803
Vanh Minh,
former Vietnamese citizen.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.406
Joined the Vietcong
at age 15,

03:25.439 --> 03:28.576
eventually became a recon
platoon leader in Dinh Tuong.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.811
Senator Tallman was
in the Army, right?

03:30.844 --> 03:33.013
- In the '60s?
- Never went to Vietnam.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.282
Never even went overseas.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.385
As far as we can tell, these two
men never even met each other.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.619
All right, so this
guy disappears

03:38.652 --> 03:43.591
in '68, resurfaces in '78...

03:43.624 --> 03:45.893
as a US citizen?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.429
Wait, how's he
pull that off?

03:48.462 --> 03:50.331
He's not a registered voter.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.866
He has no political affiliation
whatsoever.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.302
I mean, it looks
like a...

03:54.335 --> 03:55.936
classic lone gunman.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.906
Yeah, but why kill a politician
you don't even know?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.774
Doesn't make any damn sense.

04:04.812 --> 04:05.879
Landlord says

04:05.913 --> 04:09.483
that Minh paid his rent on time
and kept to himself

04:09.517 --> 04:12.353
and fixed his own faucet.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.854
Yep, and he
kept a diary.

04:13.887 --> 04:14.788
All in French,

04:14.822 --> 04:17.525
so I think we're gonna
need a translator.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.427
He planned this thing out
in advance.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.595
He bought the suit, the tie,
and the shoes a week ago.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.064
Even had time
to get the pants taken in.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.067
Well, careful prep is consistent
with the murder-suicide.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.969
"Brutus climbed
into my mind

04:29.002 --> 04:32.440
and stopped me from functioning
as a normal person."

04:32.473 --> 04:34.408
Wow, she speaks French.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.809
She dated a hockey player.

04:35.843 --> 04:39.313
"Before Brutus, I was
curious and intelligent."

04:39.347 --> 04:41.415
You know, Brutus could be
a code word for Tallman.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.550
Yeah.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.018
Did he happen to mention
what he had against this guy?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.854
He might not have had
a specific grudge.

04:46.887 --> 04:51.592
He's showing manifestations
of schizophrenia.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.395
Non-existent relationships,
repressed rage.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.864
And medication.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.466
Nice grab.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.767
(chuckling):
Thanks.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.569
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.803
That's speed.

05:02.836 --> 05:03.637
Well, abuse
would explain

05:03.671 --> 05:06.607
- high levels of aggression.
- Yep.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.108
Answers a lot of questions.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.810
Yeah, and begs
a few more

05:09.843 --> 05:11.979
like who prescribed this
and for what.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.180
Yeah.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.784
Also, why was he receiving
pension checks from the Army?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.620
The United States Army.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.791
CHARLIE:
Your mail.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.994
Oh, thanks again for use
of your address, Charles.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.129
Since the steam tunnels,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.098
Professor Mildred
has cut off all use

05:31.131 --> 05:33.100
of my faculty mailboxes.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.435
And the... the magazine.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.235
Charles.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.805
Yeah. I-I believe
this is my copy

05:37.838 --> 05:38.939
of the Quarterly Review
of Cosmology.

05:38.972 --> 05:39.807
Yeah, it is.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.609
Why are we engaged
in combat over it?

05:41.642 --> 05:42.876
Well, be-- I'll
tell-- because--

05:42.910 --> 05:46.380
There's, there's something on
the cover that may very well,

05:46.414 --> 05:49.149
um-- no, it is, it is
going to upset you.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.851
I was going to
throw it out,

05:50.884 --> 05:52.653
and then I figured
you'd find it

05:52.686 --> 05:54.822
- sooner or later.
- Just give it to me already.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.396
"Igby's Law Redefines
Gravity Flux Motivated

06:02.430 --> 06:06.133
by Sound Wave Propagation
in Bose-Einstein Condensates."

06:06.166 --> 06:08.436
Professor Johannes Igby?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.570
Um, I know

06:09.603 --> 06:11.572
you publicly disputed
Igby's approach.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.873
The man is
an anthropic imbecile.

06:12.906 --> 06:13.874
You know,
so what

06:13.907 --> 06:16.410
i-if, if he's been proven right?

06:16.444 --> 06:18.145
He's had a law named
after him.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.748
So what if he's been put
on the short list

06:20.781 --> 06:22.750
for the National Medal
of Science Award?

06:22.783 --> 06:25.052
He has?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.920
It's on page 87.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.056
So look, I mean,
it, it may sting

06:29.089 --> 06:31.825
a little bit, you
know, at first,

06:31.859 --> 06:34.595
but, um...

06:34.628 --> 06:36.597
You're smiling.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.799
I am? Are you, are you in
stunned shock?

06:38.832 --> 06:42.803
It's okay. I'll call
the campus medic.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.738
Actually,
don't do that.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.973
Tell you what
you can do.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.841
Take over my Computational
Physics class.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.477
Well, the last time
I covered that class,

06:49.510 --> 06:51.845
- one of your students...
- Thank you so much, Charles.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.681
OPERATOR:
911.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.216
MAN: There is a man with a gun
at the Quincy Hotel.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.618
Can I have your name?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.820
He is going to kill
Senator Martin Tallman.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.955
It may already be too late.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.557
No, I mean,
he doesn't sound 60

07:03.591 --> 07:05.593
and he doesn't sound Vietnamese.
No.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.996
Voice recognition says male,
Caucasian, 25 to 40.

07:09.029 --> 07:13.233
And that call came in at 12:17
from a pay phone in the lobby.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.470
By that time, Minh was
already in the ballroom.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.672
Autopsy results are in.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.908
Death from a gunshot wound
to Minh's head.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.511
We need an autopsy
to tell us that?

07:23.544 --> 07:25.779
I was actually more interested
in the pathology.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.615
ME confirmed

07:27.648 --> 07:30.951
Minh had been taking large doses
of dextroamphetamine sulfate.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.721
That prescription was written
on a stolen pad.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.824
Which suggests
intentional abuse.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.791
It's like he was

07:37.825 --> 07:40.828
getting himself angry enough
to kill Tallman.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.863
Did you get anywhere
with the pension checks?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.765
No, the VA had no records
on him,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.968
so pulling in a favor
who's pulling in a favor.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.037
And your favor's favor
called me.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.772
Agent Eppes.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.840
Raymond, Central Intelligence.
We need to talk.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.175
All right, Raymond,

07:55.208 --> 07:56.944
let's take a little walk.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.614
RAYMOND: We'd be interested in
doing an information share

08:00.648 --> 08:01.849
on the Tallman assassination.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.116
Uh-huh.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.086
Why are you guys so interested
in a California State Senator?

08:06.119 --> 08:08.188
Vanh Minh's citizenship
and pension were functions

08:08.221 --> 08:10.891
of work he performed
for us during Vietnam.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.726
What, double agent?

08:12.760 --> 08:13.994
I couldn't say.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.863
Well, see, you know,
as file-sharing goes,

08:15.896 --> 08:17.297
we're off
to a bad start here.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.166
I mean... What I mean is I don't
know.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.301
Minh was part of
a defunct program

08:21.334 --> 08:22.936
from a war we lost
30 years ago.

08:22.970 --> 08:23.804
So what are you saying?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.873
The guy was in the wind
for 25 years?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.675
And now he's front page news.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.909
And I'd like to
know what kind

08:28.942 --> 08:31.712
of damage control
we're looking at.

08:31.745 --> 08:32.713
No chest beating,

08:32.746 --> 08:34.815
just a request to keep
a colleague in the loop.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.785
All right,
fair enough.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.720
Thanks.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.558
Minh's .38 was one
of three purchased

08:44.592 --> 08:46.193
at a Nevada gun
store last month.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.562
Buyer used
a stolen ID.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.631
The store's name
is Longan Ammo.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.932
On the ATF's
watch list.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.133
Have a reputation
for playing things

08:53.166 --> 08:54.334
a little fast
and loose

08:54.367 --> 08:56.770
when it comes to background
checks and waiting periods.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.105
We got a straw purchase.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.607
Yeah, then he sold it off
to Minh.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.074
What do we got?
A white male, 30s.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.011
You really think we have some
kind of conspiracy going on?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.746
I don't know.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.783
I think we'd better find
those other two guns.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.255
CHARLIE:
So a black market dealer

09:15.288 --> 09:18.091
sends a buyer
into a gun store.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.827
Right, in this case,
with a fake ID.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.830
And the buyer purchases
multiple guns legally...

09:22.863 --> 09:23.697
Mm-hmm.

09:23.731 --> 09:24.564
And then returns them
to the dealer?

09:24.598 --> 09:26.333
Yeah, it's called
a straw purchase.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.735
AMITA: Gun stores can do that?

09:27.768 --> 09:29.670
Just sell pistols
to anyone with money?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.171
They're not supposed to,
but these people can find a way

09:31.204 --> 09:33.073
to make a buck.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.208
I know what you're thinking.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.611
An inductive application
of the network effect.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.146
Starting from Metcalfe's law?

09:39.179 --> 09:41.148
No, you know how I feel
about Metcalfe's law.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.816
You know, it's value-
based, so in my opinion,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.718
it just, it vastly overst...
(knocking)

09:44.752 --> 09:46.386
BOTH:
Hi.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.721
Can we come in?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.022
This is perfect.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.257
Where's Alan?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.159
He's in Oakland until Monday.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.627
Yeah, he's,
he's over there consulting

09:53.661 --> 09:55.228
on a waterfront
renovation project...

09:55.262 --> 09:56.830
LARRY:
Um...

09:56.864 --> 09:58.165
- I think maybe we should wait.
- No, we can't wait.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.733
Wait for what?

09:59.767 --> 10:04.037
Um, Larry has some
really big news.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.372
I'm leaving Cal Sci.

10:05.405 --> 10:09.042
I'm leaving Los Angeles
in fact, more specifically,

10:09.076 --> 10:09.843
I will be leaving

10:09.877 --> 10:11.812
the planet Earth,
though I will

10:11.845 --> 10:13.346
- remain in orbit...
- Okay.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.816
If you don't tell them,
I'm going to.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.250
I will be on the next shuttle

10:17.284 --> 10:19.152
to the International
Space Station leaving

10:19.186 --> 10:20.988
roughly three
weeks from now.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.858
- You are not...
- Wait, wait.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.326
Wait, wait,
hold on. What?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.961
You must have
suspected something.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.730
I mean with my
unorthodox living

10:29.763 --> 10:30.630
situations,

10:30.664 --> 10:32.766
- my unexplained absences.
- I thought

10:32.800 --> 10:34.234
that was you being...

10:34.267 --> 10:36.870
You.
No.

10:36.904 --> 10:37.738
And you knew about this?

10:37.771 --> 10:38.706
Well, I knew he was taking

10:38.739 --> 10:39.707
more trips to Houston.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.142
But no, I never pierced
the "veil of mystery."

10:42.175 --> 10:43.276
Yes, I guess my work

10:43.310 --> 10:46.013
in the cosmic microwave
background had some relevance

10:46.046 --> 10:49.416
to the NSA's satellite
signals technology and, uh,

10:49.449 --> 10:52.252
they contacted me
last September.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.987
Last September?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.123
Yes. Handshakes transpired,

10:56.156 --> 10:58.358
oaths were taken and
the long and the short of it

10:58.391 --> 11:01.394
is that I was made
alternate payload specialist.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.964
He's going on
the space shuttle

11:03.997 --> 11:05.398
for six months.
Wow.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.900
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

11:06.934 --> 11:09.136
Because it was always
just such a long shot,

11:09.169 --> 11:11.905
but with the recent
good fortune of the

11:11.939 --> 11:14.742
original payload specialist,
Johannes Igby,

11:14.775 --> 11:16.409
Igby's Law.
his new

11:16.443 --> 11:18.478
responsibilities
sadly prevent him from taking

11:18.511 --> 11:19.813
his seat
on the shuttle.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.148
So, so T-Minus?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.784
Um, we're scheduled
for departure on the 7th.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.252
I will be leaving
for Houston

11:25.285 --> 11:27.454
next week for
final training

11:27.487 --> 11:28.789
and my flight physical.

11:28.822 --> 11:29.957
Larry's got
the right stuff.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.259
All right, I'm getting
some champagne.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.095
- Congratulations, Larry.
- Oh, thank you.

11:39.499 --> 11:44.404
(chattering)

11:44.437 --> 11:47.140
So why Chicago?
Do not know.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.476
Go ask my publisher.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.244
I think you've got a girl there.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.846
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.782
- Girl in every port.
- Mmm.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.149
To a girl in every port.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.754
Uh, can I help you?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.101
(clicks)

12:17.537 --> 12:19.840
Stan. Oh, God.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.942
Somebody
call the cops.

12:24.945 --> 12:25.846
Oh...

12:37.557 --> 12:39.927
Male, Hispanic, 40s.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.962
The guy walks up
to this table,

12:41.995 --> 12:44.197
puts five shots
into the victim,

12:44.231 --> 12:47.835
turns the gun on himself,
misfires, walks away.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.269
Sounds a lot like
the Tallman shooting.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.138
LAPD made
the same connection.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.272
So they checked
the serial number

12:52.305 --> 12:54.808
- against our straw purchase.
- Do we have a match?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.543
Yeah, you think I'm going
to call you out here,

12:56.576 --> 12:57.811
on your night off
if we don't?

12:57.845 --> 12:59.880
Victim is Stanford Davis.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.149
This is his wife.
He's a psychiatrist.

13:02.182 --> 13:05.552
Just wrote a book called New
Methods of Operant Conditioning

13:05.585 --> 13:06.920
and Its Impact on Neuroanatomy.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.856
I'll wait for the movie.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.257
Yeah.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.524
One gun purchase has given us

13:11.558 --> 13:13.360
two execution-style murders.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.095
And one and a half suicides.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.067
You used Metcalfe's Law
after all.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.836
You know, no one likes to hear
"I told you so." Okay.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.872
What are those?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.174
It's a second gun
from a shooting last night.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.042
I'm tracing
the past patterns

13:29.076 --> 13:30.577
of transactions
across the network

13:30.610 --> 13:35.315
and it's-it's revealing
some very predictable dynamics.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.919
It's really something--
about Larry.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.020
What, the whole, uh...

13:40.053 --> 13:42.089
space station thing?

13:42.122 --> 13:43.991
Yeah, you seemed
a little, uh...

13:44.024 --> 13:45.225
A little what?

13:45.258 --> 13:46.393
I don't know... upset?

13:46.426 --> 13:47.494
Upset?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.162
What do you mean?
No, I'm-I'm upset?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.531
Of course not.
I'm not upset.

13:51.564 --> 13:52.732
I mean maybe I would be

13:52.765 --> 13:55.068
if I thought he was actually
going to go through with it.

13:55.102 --> 13:58.571
Larry asked Dr. Finch
for a leave of absence.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.307
I mean, he put his car
in storage.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.575
I have known Larry Fleinhardt

14:02.609 --> 14:04.277
for 15 years.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.114
He's not going anywhere.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.549
I think you should talk to him.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.919
Why? There's nothing
to talk about.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.054
Besides I've got
to present my findings

14:14.087 --> 14:15.155
to Don, so...

14:18.125 --> 14:20.227
DAVID:
Shooter left a pretty good

14:20.260 --> 14:21.929
print on the strap.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.463
It comes back to...

14:23.496 --> 14:25.565
Carlos Costavo.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.200
He came to the US
from Cuba

14:27.234 --> 14:30.103
with the 1980 Marielito exodus.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.272
All right, so political
refugee or a criminal?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.373
No, he's definitely a criminal.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.208
He got here, spent
ten years at Chino

14:35.242 --> 14:37.044
for robbery and assault.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.311
Costavo.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.546
He hasn't been home
in three days.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.682
But we did find
government pension checks

14:42.715 --> 14:44.251
and dextroamphetamine
sulfate.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.618
Same as Minh.
Yeah.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.387
Something really strange
is going on here.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.057
DON: We got the same MO,
same medication.

14:50.090 --> 14:54.694
Senator, psychiatrist, a
Vietnamese POW, a Cuban refugee.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.496
And the guns.
Right.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.530
Well,

14:57.564 --> 14:59.666
looks like
I'm right on time.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.368
CHARLIE:
Now here we have

15:01.401 --> 15:03.370
a list of gun sales
from Longan Ammo,

15:03.403 --> 15:04.437
going back about two years

15:04.471 --> 15:07.340
and the suspected straw
purchases are here in red.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.109
And this is ATF's list

15:09.142 --> 15:11.344
of suspected street-level
gun dealers

15:11.378 --> 15:12.412
and their sales patterns.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.983
Now, what I did was
I applied networking theory

15:16.016 --> 15:19.019
to a directed graph,
using the source

15:19.052 --> 15:21.121
and known nodes to determine
the sink.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.190
Which is kind of like...

15:23.223 --> 15:24.992
Kind of like...

15:25.025 --> 15:27.194
kind of like,
oh, kind of

15:27.227 --> 15:30.630
like a telephone, which is
actually the classic example

15:30.663 --> 15:31.731
of networking.
Okay, so

15:31.764 --> 15:34.534
we have stores and purchasers,
dealers and buyers.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.436
Tthe same network.f

15:36.469 --> 15:37.504
Right. Now, what I did

15:37.537 --> 15:39.973
was study the call patterns,
the straw purchases

15:40.007 --> 15:41.641
and I listened
for the ringing telephone.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.443
Now, I'm going to call

15:43.476 --> 15:45.278
a bullpen extension right now;

15:45.312 --> 15:47.480
and how about you guys tell me
which one I'm calling.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.316
(telephone rings)

15:52.385 --> 15:54.287
Oh, it could be about

15:54.321 --> 15:56.489
- half a dozen phones right now.
- So we've

15:56.523 --> 15:57.624
already narrowed down
the possibilities

15:57.657 --> 15:59.459
considerably.
The more calls

15:59.492 --> 16:03.496
I make... the easier it becomes
to find the right one.

16:03.530 --> 16:07.500
(telephone ringing)

16:07.534 --> 16:09.069
Hello.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.270
Yeah, sorry, I'm just

16:10.303 --> 16:11.571
demonstrating networking theory.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.441
She hung up.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.609
So...

16:16.643 --> 16:19.346
the ringing phone we're looking
for is the black market dealer,

16:19.379 --> 16:20.480
who bought
the three guns.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.316
I was actually looking
for patterns of distribution,

16:23.350 --> 16:25.418
arrests that connect
to straw sales

16:25.452 --> 16:27.487
according to time
and proximity,

16:27.520 --> 16:30.323
not to mention the kind
of weapons transacted.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.525
Now by looking at the way
that Longan Ammo

16:32.559 --> 16:35.562
made straw gun
sales and then

16:35.595 --> 16:38.198
the appearance of the guns
on the street...

16:38.231 --> 16:40.400
- You came up with a name.
- Off of Senator

16:40.433 --> 16:42.469
Tallman's shooting,
I came up with four names,

16:42.502 --> 16:44.171
and given the second shooting,

16:44.204 --> 16:45.805
I was able to narrow it down:

16:45.838 --> 16:47.774
Sam Finney, a major gun dealer.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.809
All teams, move in.
(men shouting)

16:49.842 --> 16:52.379
- We got a runner!
- Copy, a runner.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.547
FBI. You're under arrest.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.383
FBI? What'd I do
to you guys?

16:56.416 --> 16:58.318
You picked up the wrong phone.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.422
DON:
Automatic weapons,

17:02.455 --> 17:05.392
RPGs... if you do time
by the bullet,

17:05.425 --> 17:06.593
you got some
problems here.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.128
Yeah. And you can make them all

17:08.161 --> 17:09.229
- go away, right?
- Nah,

17:09.262 --> 17:11.364
I think that would take
like a presidential pardon.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.266
But I'll tell you something,
Sam, you help me,

17:13.300 --> 17:15.135
maybe I get it down
to five to ten.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.737
I won't wear a wire.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.407
Three Smith & Wesson
Model 64s,

17:20.440 --> 17:21.508
bought in Nevada last month.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.078
Longan Ammo.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.513
Guy runs the place
like he's selling socks...

17:26.546 --> 17:28.315
Get your hands back
on the table.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.782
Where'd they end up?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.485
Some guy.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.122
Some guy. All right, Sam.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.589
Marcus.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.525
All right, his name was Marcus.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.227
Tried to move him up to Glocks,

17:40.260 --> 17:41.861
but he said he wanted
to keep it simple.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.164
Did he say whfor?e wanted them

17:44.197 --> 17:45.265
Yeah, they're a little

17:45.298 --> 17:46.233
expensive for paperweights,
you know what I mean?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.567
Yeah, that's funny.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.403
I didn't ask.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.106
That's it?
That's what you got for me?

17:53.140 --> 17:57.610
Brown hair, blue eyes,
40, maybe 45.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.213
Real quiet, talked like
he was in a library.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.582
All right, sit tight.
Keep your hands on the table.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.217
Yeah, right.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.219
Problem with these
Identikit pictures,

18:06.253 --> 18:08.121
they're only as good
as the description.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.622
And Finney's
wasn't great.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.424
Hey, it's what
we got, you know.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.361
Okay, Stanford Davis was
a prison psychologist

18:14.394 --> 18:17.197
at Chino from 1983 to 1985.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.599
Wait, Costavo was there
from 1981 to 1991, so, so they

18:19.632 --> 18:20.533
knew each other.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.434
Yeah, and here's a little-known

18:21.468 --> 18:22.235
fact about
the California Penal system:

18:22.269 --> 18:24.737
they have a long
and proud history

18:24.771 --> 18:26.839
of experimenting on prisoners.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.808
I know that pharmaceutical
companies test on inmates.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.443
Yeah, but that's voluntarily,

18:30.477 --> 18:31.844
and in pretty limited
circumstances.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.146
I'm talking about behavior

18:33.180 --> 18:34.614
modification programs,

18:34.647 --> 18:35.615
sensory deprivation,
chemical treatment,

18:35.648 --> 18:39.252
psychosurgery,
many of which are underwritten

18:39.286 --> 18:40.887
by the Department
of Defense,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.422
where the CIA friend came.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.924
Including one "Brutus Project,"

18:44.957 --> 18:46.459
which Davis worked on.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.595
The same Brutus as
in Minh's journal?

18:48.628 --> 18:49.529
And the same Davis

18:49.562 --> 18:51.498
as in the shrink
who was our second victim.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.765
Julius Caesar's

18:52.799 --> 18:55.335
assassin's full name
was Marcus Brutus.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.570
Finney said he sold guns
to a guy named Marcus.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.905
So, now
we've connected

18:58.938 --> 19:01.841
Costavo to Davis,
possibly to Minh.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.211
Guess which
State Senator has been

19:04.244 --> 19:06.279
pushing legislation
to repeal the ban

19:06.313 --> 19:07.847
- on prison testing?
- Uh, Tallman.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.549
A equals B equals

19:09.582 --> 19:11.884
C equals D; it's like
one of Charlie's equations.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.355
Can't believe I just said that.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.660
Spring cleaning?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.395
Oh...

19:22.429 --> 19:25.298
As per Dr. Finch's request,
I have now

19:25.332 --> 19:27.367
thoroughly vacated my lair.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.503
I do take some comfort however,

19:30.537 --> 19:33.540
in remanding
my few prized possessions

19:33.573 --> 19:35.808
into the custody
of my closest friend.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.511
Aw, well, thanks.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.413
What do we got in here?

19:40.447 --> 19:42.549
Oh, wow,
the Newton Lacy Award.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.951
My goodness.
Uh...

19:44.984 --> 19:46.486
Of course, uh,

19:46.519 --> 19:47.487
some jazz recordings.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.222
Of course.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.691
An old... yeah,
an old T-shirt.

19:51.724 --> 19:55.495
Old T-shirt, worn on the day I
first posited causal solutions

19:55.528 --> 19:57.730
to ultrahyperbolic
wave equations

19:57.764 --> 19:58.998
and more memorably,

19:59.031 --> 20:02.235
when I vanquished
Professor Musgrave

20:02.269 --> 20:03.670
at the Cal Sci's Texas
Hold 'Em tournament.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.572
Wow, then this
is one lucky shirt.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.475
Yeah, well, not to dwell
on the negatives.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.810
I am mindful of
the risk involved

20:10.843 --> 20:12.612
in sitting atop
two million liters

20:12.645 --> 20:15.748
of combusted liquid
hydrogen and oxygen.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.484
Larry.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.287
Do you remember...

20:20.320 --> 20:22.489
when I was in
my junior year

20:22.522 --> 20:27.260
and, uh, I decided to
grow my moustache out?

20:27.294 --> 20:30.730
The word "moustache" would be
a charitable characterization.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.299
You said that
my follicle count

20:32.332 --> 20:33.800
failed to achieve
critical mass.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.535
That's... dear... sorry.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.803
No, you were
being brutally

20:36.836 --> 20:38.705
honest with me, you know.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.373
And sometimes
friends have to be

20:40.407 --> 20:41.941
brutally honest
with each other.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.946
Larry...

20:46.979 --> 20:49.749
What?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.884
You know this thing isn't
really going to happen.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.687
Because?

20:54.721 --> 20:57.790
People die in space
shuttles, Larry.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.326
You know and
at some point

20:59.359 --> 21:01.428
you're going to make
a rational assessment

21:01.461 --> 21:03.296
of this situation.
You're going to realize

21:03.330 --> 21:07.534
that shooting yourself out
of a cannon would just be

21:07.567 --> 21:08.601
feckless waste.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.370
Let me get this right.

21:10.403 --> 21:16.476
You are actually comparing
my brushing the heavens

21:16.509 --> 21:20.513
with your barely
postpubescent moustache.

21:20.547 --> 21:24.484
No, I'm just
being realistic.

21:24.517 --> 21:28.020
It's a very fortunate thing
for you that I am on the verge

21:28.054 --> 21:29.889
of fulfilling one
of life's dreams.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.524
Fortunate for me?

21:31.558 --> 21:32.992
That's correct.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.528
Because were I in a less
ebullient frame of mind,

21:35.562 --> 21:37.697
I might well just
bop you in the nose.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.767
Excuse me.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.508
Have you ever heard
of MK-ULTRA?

21:48.541 --> 21:51.911
What, that's a CIA program
in the, what, '50s.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.045
LSD, mind
control...

21:53.079 --> 21:54.514
Right, right,
LSD was part of it.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.750
But they tried
sensory deprivation,

21:57.784 --> 21:59.686
radiation, ELF.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.987
Uh-huh. What's that?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.455
Extreme Low Frequency.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.524
Certain pulses
can actually affect

22:04.557 --> 22:06.559
a subject's
emotional state.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.061
MK-ULTRA was one
of many programs.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.030
Right, like Brutus?

22:11.063 --> 22:14.066
The idea was
to program enemy agents

22:14.100 --> 22:17.103
with posthypnotic suggestions,
then send them home

22:17.136 --> 22:19.439
as sleeper assassins. Assassins.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.474
Programmed to kill themselves
after the assassination,

22:21.508 --> 22:22.475
keeping the program invisible.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.911
All right, so Minh's Vietcong...

22:24.944 --> 22:26.546
Who we never officially
identified as a POW.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.614
Costavo: Marielito.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.550
Someone figured they could
get him close to Castro.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.952
See, the thing is,
Brutus never worked.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.454
30 years of
experiments

22:34.487 --> 22:36.122
never produced a single
viable candidate.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.925
So the program was discontinued,
the subjects cut loose.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.660
Yeah, with pensions.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.429
Well, I mean, that last gun's

22:42.462 --> 22:44.864
for somebody
connected to all this.

22:44.897 --> 22:48.401
I've compiled a list
of subjects known to be

22:48.435 --> 22:49.536
in the Los
Angeles area.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.104
If Marcus has gotten the
Brutus conditioning to work--

22:52.138 --> 22:54.474
and it looks like he has--
every one of these men

22:54.507 --> 22:56.809
is a potential
weapon.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.044
What's this list?

22:58.077 --> 22:59.211
Anyone who ever
worked on Brutus.

22:59.245 --> 23:02.482
Marcus didn't just pick his
killers from the program,

23:02.515 --> 23:03.616
but his victims, too.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.852
Marcus is sending
the lab rats

23:05.885 --> 23:08.488
after the scientists.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.766
712 subjects

23:19.799 --> 23:21.434
in one mind-
control experiment

23:21.468 --> 23:22.435
in just Los Angeles?

23:22.469 --> 23:23.536
There's no telling how many

23:23.570 --> 23:25.605
the Soviets worked on
during the same time period.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.639
Oh, that's
a really good

23:26.673 --> 23:28.174
Cold War way of thinking.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.542
They're doing something bad,

23:29.576 --> 23:30.910
so let's do something
worse and bigger.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.445
Please.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.446
Why didn't you

23:33.480 --> 23:35.114
tell us about this
after the first shooting?

23:35.147 --> 23:35.915
Why would you

23:35.948 --> 23:37.717
try and protect
a failed program?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.925
You want to see
how Marcus got it to work.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.927
Think about it.
You capture a terrorist,

23:47.960 --> 23:49.729
you condition him,

23:49.762 --> 23:51.731
you send him back
to his cell-- bang.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.066
"Condition" is a really
polite word for "torture."

23:56.536 --> 23:58.137
When you're fighting
for a way of life,

23:58.170 --> 23:59.171
you use whatever weapon
is available.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.973
And before you know it,

24:01.007 --> 24:03.075
you've given up
your way of life.

24:09.949 --> 24:10.883
Charlie, what...?

24:10.917 --> 24:12.885
We got people for this.
What are you doing?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.754
What your people are doing,
they're trying to match

24:14.787 --> 24:16.756
a rudimentary
sketch against

24:16.789 --> 24:19.526
thousands of CIA
personnel files.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.628
What I'm doing here is
trying to save you time

24:21.661 --> 24:24.030
and increase success
potential considerably.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.566
Now, by weighting the value

24:26.599 --> 24:29.001
of the search criteria to look
for slight deviations--

24:29.035 --> 24:32.639
let's say Finney chose
eyebrow set #33--

24:32.672 --> 24:35.942
what I'm doing is, I'm allowing
the possibility of a near-miss.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.612
Eyebrow set
32, set 34.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.713
All right, cool.

24:40.747 --> 24:41.981
Well, thanks.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.750
Hey, um, are you guys planning

24:43.783 --> 24:46.553
any kind of party
or anything for Larry?

24:46.586 --> 24:48.988
He's not going anywhere.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.222
Well, I don't know
about that, Charlie.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.124
He sure seems to be
going someplace.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.860
(laughs):
Don...

24:53.893 --> 24:55.728
can you seriously picture

24:55.762 --> 24:57.864
Lawrence Fleinhardt
in outer space?

24:57.897 --> 25:00.266
Yeah. I don't know.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.102
I mean, more than
anyone else I know.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.170
Things change.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.305
I mean, that's the way life is.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.707
People get married;
they move on.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.676
I'm aware of that, Don.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.644
I do notice that
nowhere on that list

25:11.678 --> 25:13.580
did you include
"fly away in a rocket ship."

25:13.613 --> 25:16.248
Charlie, I'm just saying,
I know it can be tough.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.985
The toughest part is...

25:19.018 --> 25:20.219
The toughest part
is sitting around

25:20.252 --> 25:23.022
while people fuel his delusion.

25:23.055 --> 25:24.924
You see, 'cause that's not
gonna help him any

25:24.957 --> 25:26.826
when reality ultimately sets in.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.327
His delusion.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.730
All right, if you say so.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.233
* C-Come on

25:34.266 --> 25:36.603
(upbeat dance music playing)

25:36.636 --> 25:37.937
* Bounce with me

25:44.243 --> 25:45.277
(stopwatch beeps)

25:45.311 --> 25:47.880
* Bounce with me...

25:47.914 --> 25:50.983
Very impressive.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.652
Mens sana in
corpore sano.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.824
So, what do you think?

25:57.857 --> 25:59.158
Am I being
too short-sighted

25:59.191 --> 26:00.960
in my acceptance
of this mission?

26:00.993 --> 26:04.030
Are you kidding?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.999
I mean, setting aside
the experiment itself,

26:07.033 --> 26:08.234
there's no telling
what kinds of insight...

26:08.267 --> 26:09.902
No, no, no, no.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.239
Talking about
my abdication of my life,

26:13.272 --> 26:15.642
my responsibilities,
my burgeoning relationship.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.244
You know, there's some parallels
here to your own dilemma--

26:18.277 --> 26:21.280
Harvard versus Cal Sci, Charles.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.715
Well, the
difference was,

26:22.749 --> 26:24.183
Harvard wasn't offering
me the better job.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.218
What if they had?

26:26.252 --> 26:28.287
It's only six months.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.690
And Megan seems
genuinely supportive.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.892
Yeah, whereas your beau...

26:32.925 --> 26:34.894
I don't know.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.064
He seems to think that
an 11th hour rethink

26:38.097 --> 26:40.266
will reveal my
ambition to be...

26:40.299 --> 26:44.270
well, I believe the word
"feckless" was used.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.306
You know, he's never dreamt
of something he couldn't reach.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.777
So he has no idea what
it's like to want something

26:50.810 --> 26:53.312
that you might not
be able to get.

26:53.345 --> 26:56.115
So how could he understand
how much you'd give up

26:56.148 --> 26:57.249
if this chance comes along?

26:57.283 --> 26:59.986
I know. I know.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.821
You ready?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.022
What?
Let's go.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.356
(whimpers)

27:11.898 --> 27:13.165
WHITTAKER:
Give me the bottle.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.934
Got to take a leak anyway.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.168
You guys are Parole, right?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.303
Drug test?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.305
FBI.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.172
Questions.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.874
About Carlos Costavo.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.175
You and he
bunked together in Chino?

27:23.209 --> 27:25.244
Chino was three mistakes ago.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.313
I'm way too old for a fourth.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.281
Contact with
discreditable persons

27:29.315 --> 27:32.218
gets me sent back
for the rest of my nickel.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.219
So does lying to the FBI.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.854
His phone records
have your number on them.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.123
He calls me from time to time.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.324
Mostly to complain.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.458
About?

27:39.491 --> 27:42.161
Excuse me.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.331
Whichever boss...
Come on, come on, come on.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.199
Whichever boss
or girlfriend or stranger

27:47.233 --> 27:48.067
ticked him off this week.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.203
Guy's always had
a short fuse, you know.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.271
Headaches.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.272
Headaches?

27:53.305 --> 27:54.106
Some kind of

27:54.140 --> 27:56.208
drug therapy
or something in stir,

27:56.242 --> 27:58.310
got six years
dinged off his bid.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.848
Wasn't like he was right in the
head in the first place, but...

28:01.881 --> 28:03.883
You got any idea how we can
get in touch with him?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.785
Does it help me
or hurt me if I do?

28:06.953 --> 28:08.921
He spends
a lot of time

28:08.955 --> 28:10.289
at MacArthur Park.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.925
Watches the old men play chess.

28:12.959 --> 28:13.960
Thanks.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.364
(rap music playing)

28:18.397 --> 28:20.432
Chess tables are
right up here.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.168
And you know that because...

28:22.201 --> 28:24.236
'Cause I spent 13
months in a tent.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.305
It's either chess
or skin rags.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.107
Hey, check it out.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.523
FBI! Move! Back!

28:44.556 --> 28:46.392
He ran into
the garage!

28:58.470 --> 29:01.207
Carlos!

29:01.240 --> 29:02.441
Get down!

29:02.474 --> 29:04.110
COLBY:
Carlos, don't do it!

29:04.143 --> 29:07.079
Do not jump,
Carlos.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.414
Hey! Get down
from there, Carlos!

29:08.447 --> 29:11.784
- Carlos! Carlos.
- Who are you?

29:11.818 --> 29:13.786
A guy who doesn't want
to see you get hurt, all right?

29:13.820 --> 29:15.387
Well, you're 20 years too late.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.090
I've tried to

29:18.124 --> 29:19.258
do this before, you know.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.060
Never quite took the last step.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.129
Because you don't want to.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.230
And then the one time,

29:24.263 --> 29:26.432
the one time
I go through with it,

29:26.465 --> 29:28.000
the damned gun misfires.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.235
But maybe...

29:29.268 --> 29:31.270
maybe this time,
I can finally make it.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.271
Look at me,
Carlos!

29:32.304 --> 29:34.106
Look at me!
Look at me!

29:34.140 --> 29:36.208
I don't want
to do anything.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.310
Just want to talk to you.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.179
Okay?

29:40.212 --> 29:42.414
Give me two minutes.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.117
Go on and do whatever
you got to, okay?

29:45.151 --> 29:46.518
Just talk?

29:46.552 --> 29:47.820
Just want to talk.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.092
You lied to me!

29:53.125 --> 29:56.295
David, apologize to the
man for saving his life.

30:05.637 --> 30:09.208
The things
that sick bastard did...

30:09.241 --> 30:10.910
You volunteered.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.379
Yeah, well, after the first
electroshock treatment,

30:13.412 --> 30:15.281
I tried to un-volunteer.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.850
Davis said they'd put
the six years back on

30:17.884 --> 30:21.120
and another 25 for violating
a federal agreement.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.621
That was a quarter
of a century ago.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.223
Why'd you go after him now?

30:24.256 --> 30:27.193
That's when the government guy
came around.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.527
Marcus.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.230
Marcus said he was working
for the government?

30:31.263 --> 30:33.132
Said he was a doctor.

30:33.165 --> 30:37.436
Some kind of posttraumatic
follow-up program.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.105
Kind of late for that.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.206
He gave me
some drugs,

30:40.239 --> 30:42.274
but they didn't work.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.176
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.578
COSTAVO: He said I was
clinically depressed

30:46.612 --> 30:48.047
and that they
would help.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.116
I mean, the more we talked,
the madder I got!

30:50.149 --> 30:51.117
And that was...

30:51.150 --> 30:53.119
Sit down.

30:55.187 --> 30:59.325
He let slip where Davis worked.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.461
And I started following him.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.130
Gustavo, where'd you
get the gun from?

31:04.163 --> 31:05.631
Gun?

31:05.664 --> 31:08.400
Yeah.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.236
I-I don't know.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.239
I don't remember.

31:13.272 --> 31:16.542
One day, it was just there,
on my bed.

31:16.575 --> 31:20.446
Look, you know,
I'm really tired.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.649
These headaches, they make it
so hard to sleep.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.256
I mean, it boggles the mind.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.359
I mean, they give speed to
a guy who's mentally disturbed,

31:33.392 --> 31:35.561
hand him a gun,
and then point him toward

31:35.594 --> 31:37.263
the people
who tortured him.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.131
Yeah, it's not
exactly brainwashing,

31:39.165 --> 31:40.967
but it's not
exactly different.

31:41.000 --> 31:41.968
What do you think?

31:42.001 --> 31:43.002
Revenge or blackmail?

31:43.035 --> 31:44.436
Trying to show us
what he can do?

31:44.470 --> 31:47.073
He's got to have some kind
of psychological background.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.008
He knew exactly
which subjects to pick.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.277
He knew exactly
which buttons to push.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.645
CIA says there was no program
that even remotely resembles

31:53.679 --> 31:55.147
the one he was talking about.

31:55.181 --> 31:57.349
I'm gonna go back
to the original people

31:57.383 --> 31:58.450
that worked on the program.

31:58.484 --> 32:01.453
Maybe Marcus is on the list
of victims somewhere.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.688
Hold on a second.

32:02.721 --> 32:03.622
You all right?

32:05.324 --> 32:06.625
About Larry?

32:06.658 --> 32:07.859
(chuckles)

32:07.893 --> 32:11.563
You know, it's hard to feel
badly when you feel so proud.

32:11.597 --> 32:15.067
But, yeah, the timing sucks.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.168
Why do you ask?

32:16.202 --> 32:18.470
I don't know.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.306
Charlie seems to be
struggling...

32:20.339 --> 32:22.208
I just thought...

32:22.241 --> 32:26.078
I'm just trying to take care
of my own, that's all.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.080
(chuckles):
Oh, well,

32:28.114 --> 32:30.282
that would explain
that throbbing vein

32:30.316 --> 32:32.351
in the middle of your forehead.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.154
Thank you.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.089
Well, I'm here if you need me.

32:38.757 --> 32:41.493
Costavo's description
isn't exactly the same

32:41.527 --> 32:43.095
as Finney's, is it?

32:43.129 --> 32:44.696
It's a big break for us

32:44.730 --> 32:46.198
because more data is
always better data.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.034
So by weighting
the commonalities

32:48.067 --> 32:49.301
between the sketches...

32:49.335 --> 32:50.636
Oh, like if the same chin

32:50.669 --> 32:52.771
comes up twice, then it's
probably the right chin.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.140
I've actually tried to make
this algorithm

32:54.173 --> 32:55.441
even more sophisticated.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.608
So were looking for values

32:56.642 --> 33:00.079
that fall in a common range,
not just perfect matches.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.780
Since we've already
inventoried

33:01.813 --> 33:04.350
the facial points of all
of the potential suspects,

33:04.383 --> 33:07.219
we should whittle our way
down to a few candidates

33:07.253 --> 33:09.288
relatively.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.324
Didn't see that coming.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.393
Uh, are you sure this
is every person

33:14.426 --> 33:16.195
with access to
the Brutus files?

33:16.228 --> 33:17.529
Yeah. Yeah.

33:17.563 --> 33:18.697
Feels to me like

33:18.730 --> 33:20.099
were missing something
so obvious

33:20.132 --> 33:21.067
we must've forgotten about it.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.069
You know, can't see
the forest for the...

33:23.102 --> 33:24.636
Trees.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.608
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

33:29.641 --> 33:32.711
No.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.182
So when Charlie's filter
returned zero matches,

33:36.215 --> 33:37.549
we realized...

33:37.583 --> 33:39.251
- "We"?
- CHARLIE: Yeah, "we."

33:39.285 --> 33:42.188
We realized that what we have
is a classic example

33:42.221 --> 33:43.255
of Euclid's Orchard.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.256
You see, because
each perspective

33:44.290 --> 33:46.058
of an orchard is unique,

33:46.092 --> 33:48.227
not only giving us information
about the trees

33:48.260 --> 33:50.229
but about the position
of the observer.

33:50.262 --> 33:53.199
We started from Minh and Costavo
and worked our way backward.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.400
Figuring out where
all the information

33:54.433 --> 33:56.102
about their participation
in the Brutus program existed,

33:56.135 --> 33:58.104
and who might
have been privy to it.

33:58.137 --> 34:01.740
The common denominator was
the Freedom of Information Act.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.275
Guys, Brutus was top secret.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.711
You're right, but portions of it
were declassified,

34:05.744 --> 34:06.912
in the 1970s with MK-ULTRA.

34:06.945 --> 34:09.181
And then again in the '90s,
they made more of it public

34:09.215 --> 34:11.650
with the class action suit
against Chino.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.753
There were a few dozen people
who had access to these files.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.255
One of them in particular...

34:16.288 --> 34:18.124
Lawrence Dryden.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.758
He's a practicing psychiatrist
in Santa Monica.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.094
Now he happens to have a brother
named Porter,

34:22.128 --> 34:24.296
who actually served time
in Chino in '89.

34:24.330 --> 34:27.133
This guy Porter was definitely
a patient of Davis's?

34:27.166 --> 34:29.301
Brother Lawrence certainly
seemed to think so.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.303
He filed suit against
the US in 2000,

34:31.337 --> 34:32.738
but the case was dismissed
in '03.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.773
And where are the Dryden
brothers now?

34:34.806 --> 34:37.743
Porter OD'd and died
four years ago.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.311
Lawrence still lives
on the west side.

34:39.345 --> 34:43.115
Most significantly,
my facial recognition algorithm

34:43.149 --> 34:44.716
shows us that Lawrence Dryden

34:44.750 --> 34:48.687
is an 87% match
to our sketches of Marcus.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.796
(knocking)

34:57.829 --> 35:00.166
(over radio):
Alpha team, stand by.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.633
Dryden, step out.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.702
We got a search and arrest
warrant for you. Let's go, guys.

35:03.735 --> 35:04.903
- Turn around.
- Of course.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.638
Go ahead and look.
The guns aren't here.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.240
You want to save
us some time

35:08.274 --> 35:09.808
and tell us
where they are?

35:09.841 --> 35:11.343
Where they'll do the most good.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.845
You haven't changed anything;

35:13.879 --> 35:17.216
after this next killing,
the truth will have to come out.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.625
I want that third gun.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.460
You think I'm a killer?
I'm not.

35:28.494 --> 35:29.861
I'm a hero.

35:29.895 --> 35:30.829
And how is that?

35:30.862 --> 35:33.165
Because I'm willing
to make hard decisions

35:33.199 --> 35:35.501
and suffer the consequences
for a greater good.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.303
My brother was no saint,

35:37.336 --> 35:40.339
but what they did to him
should never happen, not here,

35:40.372 --> 35:41.707
not in this country.

35:41.740 --> 35:45.311
Your brother OD'd 14 years
after Brutus was over.

35:45.344 --> 35:48.814
Porter never used heroin,
not until after Chino.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.282
It was the pain from
those experiments

35:50.316 --> 35:51.917
that drove him
to the drugs.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.220
I went through the courts,
I went through the press.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.954
Everyone either didn't believe
it or didn't care.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.656
After all,
these men are just prisoners.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.591
So I knew
if I wanted to stop Brutus,

35:59.625 --> 36:01.760
that I'd have to take
stronger measures.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.562
It's has been over for years.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.464
They're planning to do it again.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.698
- Who?
- Tallman was lobbying

36:06.732 --> 36:08.967
for relaxing California's
restrictions

36:09.000 --> 36:11.237
on prisoner experiments,

36:11.270 --> 36:13.205
and that sadist Davis,

36:13.239 --> 36:15.874
offering his so-called
expert testimony.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.677
I just turned their own monsters
against them.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.213
And why's that?

36:21.247 --> 36:22.314
Couldn't pull the trigger
yourself?

36:22.348 --> 36:25.617
No, these men have already been
destroyed by Brutus.

36:25.651 --> 36:29.255
In death, think of how many
other lives they can save.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.457
That sounds to me exactly what
the CIA probably said

36:31.490 --> 36:33.459
when they started the whole
thing to begin with.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.894
So you tell me, what's the
difference between them and you?

36:52.744 --> 36:55.647
Hey.
Hey.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.317
I'm not going to apologize
for expressing my opinion.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.387
Well, I'm not going to apologize
for choosing to ignore it.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.625
You got an interesting
problem there.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.959
Yeah, yeah.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.462
It's based on a subject,
Lawrence Dryden's,

37:10.496 --> 37:12.898
access to Freedom
of Information files.

37:12.931 --> 37:16.034
See, he had his pick of any of
two dozen potential assassins,

37:16.067 --> 37:18.870
and I'm just trying
to narrow down those candidates

37:18.904 --> 37:20.539
down by accessibility,
by health, predisposition.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.642
I just don't think I can be
narrow enough, quickly enough.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.744
Have you considered
incorporating

37:25.777 --> 37:27.946
target selection theory?

37:27.979 --> 37:28.914
You mean Von Neumann

37:28.947 --> 37:30.949
and the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.918
Well, actually, before then,

37:32.951 --> 37:34.853
Von Neumann's acolytes
had been doing work,

37:34.886 --> 37:38.023
more applicable I think, in the
arena of conventional bombing.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.425
The theory being
that if you kept bombing

37:39.458 --> 37:42.894
high-value targets, over time,
the enemy would concentrate

37:42.928 --> 37:44.396
their defenses there.

37:44.430 --> 37:47.899
But if you bombed
low-value targets,

37:47.933 --> 37:49.568
yeah, you'd siphon off
some of their defenses,

37:49.601 --> 37:52.571
but over time, you would
sacrifice manpower,

37:52.604 --> 37:55.040
gasoline,
deplete your bomb supplies.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.608
So you're suggesting,

37:56.642 --> 37:58.944
and as always, feel free
to correct me if I'm wrong,

37:58.977 --> 38:01.447
that I analyze
not only potential killers,

38:01.480 --> 38:03.649
but potential victims as well.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.417
The list of people
publicly endorsing

38:05.451 --> 38:07.953
increased prisoner
experimentation.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.957
So refining my previous analysis
of Dryden's motivations

38:11.990 --> 38:16.495
and assessment of his likelihood
of success...

38:16.528 --> 38:18.830
Well, Larry, you are...

38:21.733 --> 38:24.536
...gone.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.026
CHARLIE:
Hey, Don, so I just finished

38:48.059 --> 38:50.929
my target select
theory analysis

38:50.962 --> 38:53.064
and the most
probable next victim

38:53.098 --> 38:55.066
is an army colonel
who served at Leavenworth.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.802
He supervised experiments
on military prisoners

38:56.835 --> 38:58.670
for the Brutus Project.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.706
DON: Great, Charlie. That's
good. Megan's got the colonel.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.007
I'm on my way
to clear his house now.

39:03.909 --> 39:04.976
And the killer?

39:05.010 --> 39:08.013
CHARLIE:
He's a man named Gates.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.849
He was one of the prisoners
at Leavenworth.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.485
DON: All right, we got
David and Colby

39:13.519 --> 39:14.886
on their way to pick him up.

39:37.676 --> 39:40.879
(indistinct shouting)

39:45.984 --> 39:47.586
Gate's isn't here.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.530
Drop it now!

39:58.564 --> 39:59.965
Drop it!

39:59.998 --> 40:01.633
(gunshots)

40:04.770 --> 40:07.506
DON:
Guys, guys, we're clear.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.876
(over radio): Subject down.
Repeat, subject down.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.044
(indistinct radio transmission)

40:17.916 --> 40:19.885
Now that we have Marcus
and all three guns,

40:19.918 --> 40:21.219
I guess this case
is closed.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.522
What are you
talking about?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.657
We don't even know
who else Dryden got to.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.626
Case closed?

40:27.659 --> 40:28.627
Okay, maybe I misspoke.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.895
We're not going to allow you

40:29.928 --> 40:31.563
to open up any more lines
of investigation.

40:31.597 --> 40:32.864
Say what?

40:32.898 --> 40:34.600
This is a national security
issue.

40:34.633 --> 40:35.801
You're going to cover
this up, aren't you?

40:35.834 --> 40:39.505
This was never about the past;
this is about the future.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.173
So Dryden was right?

40:42.207 --> 40:45.010
Tallman was pushing prison
testing legislation?

40:45.043 --> 40:48.179
This is just a back door
to restart Brutus?

40:48.213 --> 40:49.648
You've got to be kidding me.

40:49.681 --> 40:50.782
MEGAN: What are you going to do
with him,

40:50.816 --> 40:53.819
stick him in Guantanamo so he
can't talk to anyone?

40:53.852 --> 40:55.854
Your assistance
has been appreciated,

40:55.887 --> 40:57.923
but this doesn't have to do
with you anymore.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.758
I shot a man tonight.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.760
And your country thanks you.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.233
I'd stay down unless
you want to get hit again.

41:10.902 --> 41:14.873
* I had a dream the sky
was set on fire... *

41:14.906 --> 41:17.709
LARRY:
The night of the 18th,

41:17.743 --> 41:19.044
I will be right there,

41:19.077 --> 41:20.979
between Cancer
and Leo Minor,

41:21.012 --> 41:24.583
visible for
roughly 14 seconds.

41:24.616 --> 41:25.784
Hmm.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.053
Then I'll have
to get a telescope.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.955
I guess I could
pull strings,

41:29.988 --> 41:33.759
get you access to
Cal Sci's Celestron.

41:33.792 --> 41:37.929
Maybe I'd like to watch you
from my own bedroom,

41:37.963 --> 41:40.632
by myself.

41:40.666 --> 41:41.867
Listen...

41:41.900 --> 41:45.804
you know, I realize
our relationship

41:45.837 --> 41:49.007
hasn't been exactly...
forward-leaning.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.810
I do want you to know

41:51.843 --> 41:54.846
my heart will remain yours
in my absence.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.649
While you're in a space capsule
with three guys?

41:57.683 --> 41:58.984
(chuckles)

41:59.017 --> 42:01.953
I should hope so.

42:01.987 --> 42:03.855
You know what I mean.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.924
I do know what you mean.

42:05.957 --> 42:09.595
But maybe for tonight,
we should just...

42:09.628 --> 42:11.963
lean forward a little.

42:19.004 --> 42:24.275
* And for a while...

42:24.309 --> 42:28.947
* I don't care
what comes tomorrow... *

42:28.980 --> 42:32.350
Charlie?

42:32.383 --> 42:35.621
* I'm alive...

42:35.654 --> 42:38.824
He's really going to do it,
isn't he?

42:38.857 --> 42:44.596
* And that's
all I need today... *

42:44.630 --> 42:47.599
He's going to go.

42:55.206 --> 42:58.176
He's going to go.

43:04.315 --> 43:09.955
* I had a dream
the sky was set on fire. *
