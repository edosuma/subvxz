00:28.961 --> 00:30.629
Ermakov, get out!

00:48.014 --> 00:49.149
Now, face the wall.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.949
So, can I give you a hug now?

01:26.785 --> 01:28.054
Aren't you afraid...

01:29.721 --> 01:31.124
to hug the enemy of the people?

01:33.126 --> 01:34.793
Oh, go to hell!

01:42.835 --> 01:44.070
There is a task for you.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.177
We don't have people.
We lost many.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.712
The rest are at the front,
or you know where.

01:53.745 --> 01:55.381
These are reliable people.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.083
When do we have
to be ready, sir?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.750
In two days at the most.

02:00.919 --> 02:02.021
And the captain?

02:03.423 --> 02:04.890
Knocked down a rank.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.126
The party card?

02:08.860 --> 02:10.196
What kind of mortar gun is it?

02:11.464 --> 02:13.066
It's a top-secret project.

02:15.168 --> 02:16.969
A powerful launching unit

02:17.604 --> 02:19.139
on the load-carrying vehicle.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.374
Made at the Communist
International factory.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.077
The first salvo was on
July 14th, near Rudnia.

02:24.776 --> 02:27.147
The area of destruction is huge.

02:27.679 --> 02:28.914
How did it get there?

02:29.382 --> 02:30.749
Oh, you'll find out soon.

02:34.987 --> 02:37.390
I admit I'm guilty.
I'm ready to be punished.

02:42.861 --> 02:43.695
Sergeant!

02:49.835 --> 02:51.371
Take the convict away now.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.439
Hands behind your
back. Dismissed.

03:12.449 --> 03:13.885
Wait a second, soldier.

03:15.553 --> 03:16.520
Yes?

03:16.822 --> 03:21.325
Can you show us the place where
you left the launching unit?

03:22.694 --> 03:24.495
I could find it with
my eyes closed.

03:26.731 --> 03:30.135
Galiyev. An NKVD High
School student.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.803

03:34.105 --> 03:36.875

horseback riding.

03:36.908 --> 03:39.376
The leader of the group.
He has initiative.

03:39.410 --> 03:42.013
<i>At the moment, his detachment
is the most effective one.</i>

03:42.848 --> 03:43.447

<i>Second place at the All-Soviet

03:57.996 --> 04:00.765
Knysh. Boxing master of sports.

04:00.799 --> 04:02.533
He has the most endurance.

04:02.566 --> 04:03.735
Instant reaction;

04:03.768 --> 04:05.536
a strong puncher
with both hands.

04:08.940 --> 04:09.941
Ivanov!

04:12.811 --> 04:14.079
Belous, go on!

04:15.180 --> 04:16.413
Very good!

04:17.048 --> 04:19.617
Altynov. A skier and a hunter.

She's an archery master
of sports.

04:31.495 --> 04:33.832
<i>She's also a university
student majoring in law.</i>

04:36.467 --> 04:38.036
Which one can use a radio?

04:38.435 --> 04:40.171
Everyone has been trained.

04:45.509 --> 04:47.478
I will need an interpreter, too.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.457
May I come in?

05:00.859 --> 05:01.793
Yes.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.430
Are you Ermakov?

05:07.165 --> 05:08.166
That's right.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.936
Anna Reiner. I'm
your interpreter.

05:24.049 --> 05:25.083
Fall in!

05:29.220 --> 05:32.157
The password for
recognition is "100."

05:32.190 --> 05:33.224
I will explain.

05:33.692 --> 05:35.126
For example, I name

05:35.559 --> 05:36.928
a figure of 30,

05:37.594 --> 05:41.232
and you must answer with another
figure which adds up to 100.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.802
So, is that clear?

05:43.835 --> 05:44.803
Reiner?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.171
Seventy.

05:46.570 --> 05:47.973
- Knysh.
- One.

05:50.742 --> 05:51.910
It's 99.

05:54.779 --> 05:56.513
Come on, jump now!

05:58.850 --> 06:00.218
- Repack it.
- Yes, sir.

06:06.623 --> 06:07.859
Tighten this strap.

06:25.609 --> 06:26.745
Right dress!

06:29.347 --> 06:30.581
Attention!

06:31.416 --> 06:33.218
Group, here's the
operation order.

06:38.589 --> 06:41.259
"The 'Agate' group,
consisting of eight people,

06:41.292 --> 06:42.994
the commander of
the group being

06:43.028 --> 06:45.562
State Security
Captain Ermakov..."

06:45.596 --> 06:47.832
- Yeah.
- "...has an objective

06:48.867 --> 06:52.937
to be air landed behind enemy
lines, in the grid 23/14.

06:53.972 --> 06:56.941
Then to move to the area
of the village Vyselki...

06:58.276 --> 07:01.079
to locate the BM-13
launching unit,

07:01.112 --> 07:03.681
and to destroy it by
means of demolition,

07:03.715 --> 07:05.616
or in some other
possible manner.

07:06.951 --> 07:09.287
After completing the
main task,

07:10.021 --> 07:12.891
the aforementioned group
is not to return back.

07:12.924 --> 07:15.592
The group is to stay behind
the enemy lines.

07:16.027 --> 07:17.594
Major General Sukhotin."

07:19.330 --> 07:20.632
At ease.

07:20.665 --> 07:21.666
At ease.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.134
Is everything clear?

07:23.501 --> 07:24.302
Yes, sir.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.181
Get ready, everyone.

08:10.682 --> 08:12.417
Get ready, everyone!

08:12.450 --> 08:13.651
Here!

08:17.755 --> 08:20.391
All right, go ahead
now! Let's go!

08:21.326 --> 08:22.360
Come on!

08:22.861 --> 08:25.063
Come on! Let's go!

08:25.463 --> 08:27.298
Come on! Let's go!

10:15.340 --> 10:16.407
Seventy.

10:20.478 --> 10:21.946
- Thirty
- Are you OK?

10:22.247 --> 10:24.382
I'm fine. Are the
others with you?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.317
Knysh and Altynov are
looking for P.D.M.M.

10:40.898 --> 10:41.766
Listen to me.

10:41.799 --> 10:45.136
We need to walk five
kilometers through

10:45.169 --> 10:46.771
the woods to get
to the mortar gun.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.240
Rally point is three
kilometers away.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.075
When we jumped out,

10:51.109 --> 10:53.511
the wind settled in
south-west, so...

10:54.045 --> 10:56.247
second group drifted
to grid five.

11:00.918 --> 11:01.919
Forty!

11:02.688 --> 11:05.857
- Rouslan, it's me!
- Answer by the rules. Forty.

11:05.890 --> 11:07.292
- It's 60.
- Come here and help.

11:15.933 --> 11:17.268
- The other one?
- No.

11:18.202 --> 11:19.203
Who?

11:19.570 --> 11:20.571
Siavris.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.308
- Alive?
- I think he's OK.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.518
- Siavris, get your knife.
- What for?

11:33.551 --> 11:35.019
To cut your shrouds.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.102
Come on, cut the shrouds.

11:53.204 --> 11:55.473
The Germans are coming!
Come on, take him down!

11:55.506 --> 11:57.542
Let's go! Siavris, hurry up!

11:59.944 --> 12:00.945
Cut it!

12:02.613 --> 12:03.614
Hurry up!

12:20.565 --> 12:21.599
My arm!

12:22.066 --> 12:23.968
What? Are you OK?

12:25.169 --> 12:26.471
I don't know!

12:26.839 --> 12:28.139
I don't know!

12:28.172 --> 12:29.574
- All right, go. I'll cover you.
- OK.

12:33.277 --> 12:34.412
Get up.

12:34.445 --> 12:37.048
Hold it, Belous! Here.

12:39.517 --> 12:41.219
We can't go into action.

12:41.252 --> 12:42.620
We won't make it
out alive if we do.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.590
I'll lead them away.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.358
Go. Go now.

14:34.565 --> 14:35.366
Let's go.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.063
The first rally point is here.

15:06.665 --> 15:08.099
- Knysh.
- Aye!

15:09.600 --> 15:11.102
Stay and wait for the group.

15:12.838 --> 15:14.740
Subbotina and
Altynov, follow me.

15:15.506 --> 15:16.240
Yes, sir.

16:38.657 --> 16:42.426
And I said, "Go!", but the
animal didn't move an inch.

16:43.895 --> 16:45.129
It's 99.

16:52.203 --> 16:53.437
Drop your weapon!

16:54.171 --> 16:56.474
- Drop your weapon!
- Easy, easy, easy, buddy!

16:56.507 --> 16:57.643
Easy!

16:57.676 --> 16:59.276
- Drop your weapon, now!
- Easy.

17:05.884 --> 17:06.852
Stay put.

17:19.530 --> 17:20.531
Stop it!

17:20.999 --> 17:22.566
Hey, stop it, guys!

17:22.901 --> 17:23.969
Hey, I'm a friend!

17:24.002 --> 17:26.337
What are you doing, you guys?
I'm Russian! Hey!

17:32.911 --> 17:35.179
I'm not the enemy or
a policeman!

17:35.881 --> 17:36.882
I'm...

17:37.314 --> 17:38.784
I'm a recon scout...

17:39.151 --> 17:40.451
from Moscow!

17:40.484 --> 17:41.853
Air landed last night!

17:43.521 --> 17:46.290
You hear that? He tells a
new fairy-tale.

17:46.323 --> 17:47.458
But it's true!

17:48.359 --> 17:51.328
It's true! You can look!
It's inside my collar!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.497
Gnat, hold on a second.

17:55.801 --> 17:56.868
Check it out.

18:10.314 --> 18:11.482
Give that to me.

18:20.025 --> 18:22.694
How many of you recon guys
landed here, huh?

18:25.897 --> 18:27.264
Quite a few.

18:27.799 --> 18:29.000
Why the hustle, then?

18:29.935 --> 18:32.536
- What do you mean?
- Why did they send you here?

18:34.906 --> 18:36.240
I don't know.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.343
I swear I don't.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.913
We were to be told
after we landed.

18:41.947 --> 18:42.748
It could be true.

18:43.215 --> 18:46.752
OK, so that's why this duffel
bag is stuffed with food,

18:47.185 --> 18:49.821
concentrates, butter,
anything you need.

18:50.421 --> 18:51.489
OK, buddy.

18:52.858 --> 18:54.025
You're going with us now.

18:59.765 --> 19:00.966
- Ninety.
- Ten.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.602
Are there two of you?

19:07.404 --> 19:08.539
Two and a half.

19:15.680 --> 19:16.648
Can you walk?

19:17.515 --> 19:18.282
Yes, sir.

19:20.051 --> 19:20.819
I rested a bit, sir.

19:20.852 --> 19:22.988
Comrade Captain, I
beg to report.

19:23.021 --> 19:24.288
Go ahead.

19:24.956 --> 19:25.957
Reiner.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.059
Looks like she was killed.

20:39.597 --> 20:43.068
Here. This is the place,
Comrade Commander.

20:43.101 --> 20:44.970
There, look! The
brushwood is scattered.

20:45.971 --> 20:47.404
Maybe you mixed
something up?

20:49.440 --> 20:52.110
They towed it with the APC.

20:53.477 --> 20:54.813
There's only one way here.

20:56.447 --> 20:57.749
To the village of Vyselki.

20:58.149 --> 20:59.583
Let's go straight
through the woods.

21:01.086 --> 21:02.087
Come on!

21:29.814 --> 21:31.415
So? What happened, then?

21:34.653 --> 21:36.087
Two salvos near Rudnia.

21:36.955 --> 21:40.591
So powerful -
wails, bangs, columns of fire.

21:41.525 --> 21:43.194
All hell broke loose.

21:43.228 --> 21:45.096
And then we were
forced to retreat,

21:45.130 --> 21:47.866
right after the
mechanized corps.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.467
After that they
churned up the earth,

21:50.835 --> 21:52.137
and so we got stuck.

21:53.672 --> 21:55.740
And we found
ourselves encircled.

21:56.241 --> 21:58.877
We had to take out
the mortar guns.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.712
So we went ahead.

22:01.379 --> 22:03.682
Mine was the last one left.

22:04.382 --> 22:06.084
Suddenly, the
"Messers" came flying.

22:06.318 --> 22:07.551
The Boche
started to fire.

22:08.853 --> 22:10.621
Killed... everyone.

22:10.989 --> 22:13.191
The commander was killed, too.

22:13.224 --> 22:14.059
What did you do?

22:14.092 --> 22:16.261
I jumped in the car
and then I left.

22:16.294 --> 22:17.829
They followed me.

22:17.862 --> 22:19.164
They fired and fired.

22:20.732 --> 22:23.702
I don't remember getting
into the lake.

22:24.669 --> 22:28.239
I just remember
the truck going underwater.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.476
The explosives,
they were left under the seat.

22:34.245 --> 22:36.513
Why didn't you take
them out, huh?

22:39.918 --> 22:41.252
Because I can't swim.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.055
I was always afraid of water.

22:44.555 --> 22:46.091
What kind of a mortar was it?

22:48.293 --> 22:49.694
It's called "Katyusha."

22:56.167 --> 22:59.270
Comrade Captain, is
that the unit we need?

22:59.304 --> 23:01.538
It is. It's time to act now.

23:06.878 --> 23:08.880
Attention. Listen to me.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.649
Altynov, the tower!

24:47.078 --> 24:49.347
Altynov, blow up the
vehicle now!

24:49.848 --> 24:51.049
We have to retreat!

25:52.210 --> 25:56.314
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.

25:56.514 --> 25:57.749
Easy. Easy, easy.

25:59.484 --> 26:00.685
Easy.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.121
Easy.

26:23.508 --> 26:24.742
Who's there?

26:26.044 --> 26:27.178
Come out of there!

26:29.147 --> 26:30.048
Come out!

26:47.031 --> 26:48.266
On the cart, now.

26:48.299 --> 26:49.434
Come on. Come on.

26:49.467 --> 26:50.802
Hurry up. Hurry up.

26:56.407 --> 26:57.442
Lie down.

27:02.847 --> 27:04.482
Oh, God, how thin she is!

27:05.216 --> 27:06.784
Come on, now, eat.

27:06.818 --> 27:09.787
She's not thin. All ballet
dancers have a regime.

27:12.056 --> 27:13.825
Where did the two of
you come from?

27:13.858 --> 27:14.525
We're from Leningrad.

27:16.461 --> 27:17.895
How did you end up here?

27:19.831 --> 27:21.766
We came to visit
our grandparents.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.434
For the summer, to Bystrovka.

27:24.002 --> 27:25.370
And then the war started.

27:27.305 --> 27:29.107
And where are your
grandparents now?

27:36.614 --> 27:38.416
The Germans bayoneted them.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.051
Dead in their yard.

27:40.084 --> 27:41.352
Oh, dear Lord!

27:43.921 --> 27:45.156
Are there Germans here?

27:46.891 --> 27:48.092
Not in our village.

27:49.093 --> 27:50.561
They're stationed in Vyselki.

28:16.354 --> 28:17.388
I'm ready.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.500
Code the message.

28:31.936 --> 28:33.304
Seventeenth to third.

28:33.971 --> 28:37.141
The group is at
the scheduled place right now.

28:37.643 --> 28:40.144
intensive searches are
being continued.

28:49.387 --> 28:50.488
Effective...

28:51.522 --> 28:54.525
and mission-capable.

28:54.926 --> 28:57.528
Entrusted task
will be completed at any cost.

28:58.029 --> 29:00.031
The mortar gun left
at the territory

29:00.064 --> 29:01.899
occupied by the enemy
will be destroyed.

29:02.934 --> 29:06.437
Group Commander,
Captain Ermakov.

29:10.274 --> 29:11.109
Period.

31:03.187 --> 31:06.090
The woods are good
here. Not many gnats.

31:06.692 --> 31:07.592
No animals, though.

31:07.626 --> 31:10.495
Sesingaly, tell me,
where are you from?

31:11.462 --> 31:14.098
From Altai. I'm Kazakh.

31:14.131 --> 31:15.233
That's far away.

31:15.801 --> 31:17.535
And I was born near Putyvl.

31:17.568 --> 31:19.771
- Ukrainian?
- No. I'm Goryun.

31:19.805 --> 31:21.673
- Who?
- It's an ethnic group.

31:22.808 --> 31:25.142
Well, it's not very big at all.

31:27.078 --> 31:29.815
And with this damn war
going on and on...

31:29.848 --> 31:31.349
It will be over soon.

31:31.817 --> 31:33.551
That's what you
thought back home.

31:33.986 --> 31:35.787
We got out of the encirclement,

31:36.254 --> 31:40.358
two weeks walking in enemy rear.

31:41.125 --> 31:44.161
Our troops retreated
back to Moscow.

31:44.863 --> 31:46.698
No, it won't be over soon.

31:47.164 --> 31:48.800
So I guess we're
gonna fight, then.

31:50.802 --> 31:52.570
Do you know how
many boys like you

31:52.603 --> 31:54.605
were taken to the
front back in June?

31:54.640 --> 31:57.241
They were young,
singing songs and laughing.

31:57.275 --> 31:58.710
They wanted to fight and win.

31:59.277 --> 32:01.847
And then they were all sent
under these tanks.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.215
- Hold it, Siavris.
- What's wrong, Commander?

32:05.651 --> 32:06.752
They have a right to know.

32:15.426 --> 32:16.695
Incoming!

32:16.728 --> 32:17.729
Retreat!

32:36.213 --> 32:37.615
Siavris!

33:01.606 --> 33:02.607
Slava!

33:03.809 --> 33:04.810
Slava!

33:06.945 --> 33:09.280
- Slava, where does it hurt?
- My leg!

33:09.313 --> 33:10.882
- What's that?
- His leg.

33:13.184 --> 33:14.385
All right, easy, easy, easy.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.855
Come on. Let me
take your boot off.

33:16.888 --> 33:18.790
Here. Come on, come on, come on!

33:20.759 --> 33:21.827
Nice and easy.

33:22.493 --> 33:24.428
Here we go. All right.
It's all right.

33:26.230 --> 33:26.832
Knife.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.501
There, there.

33:31.268 --> 33:32.269
There.

33:33.504 --> 33:34.505
There.

33:35.941 --> 33:37.608
Seems like the bone's OK.

33:39.878 --> 33:40.879
You OK?

33:40.912 --> 33:43.414
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Doesn't hurt at all.

33:49.487 --> 33:52.356
- It's OK, Slava.
- Yeah, I'm fine. Take your time.

33:53.125 --> 33:55.493
- Are the rest of you all right?
- Yes.

33:59.263 --> 34:00.866
- OK, just a sec.
- Altynov, I need water.

34:04.602 --> 34:05.603
Now the bandage.

34:07.973 --> 34:09.373
They were aiming at us.

34:11.909 --> 34:14.512
Must have spotted us
when we sent the message.

34:24.621 --> 34:26.322
Is the transmitter damaged?

34:26.858 --> 34:27.659
No.

34:28.659 --> 34:29.661
Altynov...

34:30.896 --> 34:32.228
listen to my order.

34:32.964 --> 34:34.364
Take the radio.

34:36.735 --> 34:38.202
You must go now.

34:39.402 --> 34:40.639
Here, to this grid.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.275
Then you must connect with
Moscow every two hours.

34:46.011 --> 34:47.879
- Is everything clear?
- Yes, sir.

34:50.281 --> 34:51.348
Go ahead.

34:53.384 --> 34:54.385
Yes, sir.

34:57.488 --> 35:00.591
Subbotina, the place
where Knysh was left,

35:00.624 --> 35:01.693
can you find it?

35:01.727 --> 35:03.962
Yes, Comrade Captain, sir.
It's in the south-west.

35:04.462 --> 35:06.564
Yes. It's grid five.

35:07.331 --> 35:07.833
Go ahead.

35:08.734 --> 35:09.366
Yes, sir.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.234
Belous.

35:12.738 --> 35:13.739
Can you walk?

35:14.773 --> 35:15.807
Yes, sir.

35:17.075 --> 35:18.242
Off you go, then.

35:23.982 --> 35:25.016
The coast is clear.

35:29.821 --> 35:30.856
Let's go.

35:40.331 --> 35:41.733
- Tikhon!
- What?

35:44.069 --> 35:47.471
Look. Are those
partisans... or gangsters?

35:49.007 --> 35:51.743
Mmmmm.

35:51.777 --> 35:53.344
That's some good stuff.

35:54.079 --> 35:55.981
Nice and strong. Good job.

35:57.281 --> 36:00.618
What do you think you're doing?
What are you doing, you jerk?

36:00.652 --> 36:02.087
Get some liquor, some moonshine.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.022
Come on. We need to
warm up. Move it!

36:04.055 --> 36:05.757
But I don't have a drop
of alcohol!

36:05.791 --> 36:07.458
Oh, don't you
really? None?

36:07.793 --> 36:09.094
No. We don't make it.

36:09.127 --> 36:11.062
Stop lying, you two!
Just hand it over!

36:11.096 --> 36:12.363
So, that's how you
fight the war?

36:12.931 --> 36:13.765
Shut up!

36:18.837 --> 36:22.073
It's quite a place that
you guys got here!

36:29.480 --> 36:31.049
Holy cow!

36:33.384 --> 36:35.452
Hey, guys!
Guys, I found it!

36:39.390 --> 36:42.127
Hehe. Well, well! So,
you do make moonshine,

36:42.160 --> 36:44.029
you no-good
Boches' bootlicker.

36:44.062 --> 36:46.497
That's turpentine.
It's not for drinking.

36:46.965 --> 36:49.400
It's for paint and varnish.

36:49.433 --> 36:50.568
A craftsman?

36:50.601 --> 36:51.703
A carpenter.

36:57.474 --> 36:58.609
Look at your soldier!

36:59.311 --> 37:01.545
His rifle butt, it's cracked.

37:02.180 --> 37:03.815
He should give it to me.

37:03.849 --> 37:06.550
I can... I'll fix it in no time.

37:10.421 --> 37:12.123
Oh, what a surprise.

37:12.924 --> 37:14.025
Look who's here.

37:14.326 --> 37:15.660
Well, come out.

37:16.194 --> 37:17.829
Come on, come on, come on.

37:21.432 --> 37:22.433
- Liova...
- Come on!

37:23.835 --> 37:25.737
Don't be shy, we're all friends.

37:26.972 --> 37:29.406
My niece and nephew
from Vyselki.

37:31.810 --> 37:33.111
You were hiding Jews?

37:33.444 --> 37:35.146
My sister's kids.

37:35.180 --> 37:36.948
Well, you must...

37:37.682 --> 37:40.484
be rewarded for
that, my dear man.

37:41.853 --> 37:43.021
What's your name?

37:43.855 --> 37:44.856
Larisa.

37:46.224 --> 37:47.424
He's my brother.

37:47.726 --> 37:48.860
How old is he, then?

37:49.327 --> 37:50.561
I'm almost 12.

37:52.731 --> 37:56.500
OK. Now, listen to my order.

37:57.736 --> 37:59.137
You are now members

38:00.205 --> 38:01.673
of my unit.

38:02.841 --> 38:05.509
We'll be fighting together,
all right? Let's go.

38:06.543 --> 38:08.479
Come on. Come on, let's go!

38:08.512 --> 38:09.180
Come on, come on.

38:10.148 --> 38:11.582
You beautiful thing.

40:27.819 --> 40:28.853
It's 50!

40:30.955 --> 40:32.323
It's 50! Knysh!

41:09.360 --> 41:11.362
- Are you partisans?
- Yeah, we are.

41:12.430 --> 41:14.199
Who's this tied-up
guy, a traitor?

41:14.232 --> 41:15.066
Uh huh.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.635
Do you think they're
gonna give me a gun?

41:17.669 --> 41:19.737
Of course they will,
after you take an oath.

41:23.775 --> 41:24.776
Here.

41:26.211 --> 41:27.812
- I found this.
- Did he desert?

41:28.813 --> 41:29.948
No, he couldn't.

41:30.281 --> 41:31.216
- Something must have happened.
- Mmhmm.

41:31.649 --> 41:34.786
Don't stigmatize the guy right
away. Maybe he's in trouble?

41:34.819 --> 41:37.322
- Stop talking, Siavris.
- Yes, sir.

41:37.355 --> 41:38.656
Can you walk?

41:39.324 --> 41:40.158
Yes, sir.

41:41.092 --> 41:42.127
Very good.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.863
Let's dislocate to the bridge
observation point.

41:45.396 --> 41:46.397
Follow me.

41:48.766 --> 41:49.901
Slava, take this.

41:52.170 --> 41:55.240
Move it, move it, move it.
Come on, come on, come on.

41:57.142 --> 41:59.110
So, you're not from here, huh?

41:59.144 --> 42:01.412
We're from Leningrad.
Have you ever been there?

42:01.446 --> 42:02.313
Sure thing.

42:02.614 --> 42:04.115
Gnat, you're the next to
bring water.

42:04.149 --> 42:05.450
I'm not a water boy, Sergeant.

42:05.483 --> 42:07.051
- What?
- You heard me.

42:07.085 --> 42:08.786
You're way too bold, dude.

42:15.860 --> 42:17.362
What will the next order be?

42:17.395 --> 42:20.198
Well, now it's time for
a suitability assessment.

42:20.231 --> 42:21.699
A hundred meters.

42:21.733 --> 42:24.469
Run from here to that
tree way over there.

42:24.502 --> 42:26.070
Go on, I'll time you. Ready?

42:26.771 --> 42:28.072
Get set. Ready?

42:30.041 --> 42:30.875
I'm ready.

42:50.228 --> 42:51.362
And go!

43:55.159 --> 43:56.761
Untie me!

43:57.161 --> 43:58.796
Come on!

43:58.830 --> 44:00.465
Untie my hands, right now!

44:01.599 --> 44:02.800
Hurry up!

44:04.535 --> 44:06.070
Take that!

44:08.840 --> 44:09.874
Ferz!

44:49.614 --> 44:51.816
[heavy breathing[

45:04.195 --> 45:07.031
It's OK. Nobody will
hurt you anymore.

46:01.252 --> 46:02.453
Liova.

46:13.231 --> 46:14.232
Liova...

46:15.533 --> 46:17.301
Liova was very talented.

46:18.670 --> 46:19.904
He was...

46:20.471 --> 46:21.973
He was even told he'd...

46:23.241 --> 46:25.109
become the new Tsiolkovsky.

46:28.379 --> 46:29.380
He...

46:30.515 --> 46:32.450
Once, he made...

46:33.184 --> 46:37.388
he made a Zeppelin model
for our dad's birthday.

46:41.559 --> 46:44.495
Don't cry. They've
already paid for that.

46:56.607 --> 46:58.710
Here they are. They got moving.

46:59.845 --> 47:02.313
Looks like we've stirred up
that hornets' nest.

47:06.317 --> 47:07.518
So many of them.

47:07.985 --> 47:09.620
They must have hidden
your "Katyusha."

47:10.521 --> 47:11.956
I wish we knew where.

47:18.764 --> 47:22.099
They'll take it to the station
sooner or later.

47:30.809 --> 47:32.176
What do we do, Commander?

47:53.231 --> 47:54.532
Belous, Galiyev.

48:14.285 --> 48:15.286
Come here.

50:18.910 --> 50:19.911
Come on!

50:37.929 --> 50:41.365
Wait for me, guys!

50:48.640 --> 50:49.675
You OK?

50:50.274 --> 50:52.543
- Can't walk anymore.
- Where are you taking me, huh?

50:54.713 --> 50:55.714
Shut up!

51:04.321 --> 51:05.957
I was happy when I saw you guys.

51:06.658 --> 51:08.860
I thought, "Thank
God, our troops came!"

51:09.728 --> 51:10.929
Because we've been
waiting and waiting.

51:10.962 --> 51:12.229
Stop talking, now!

51:12.263 --> 51:13.497
Oh, come on!

51:19.303 --> 51:20.471
Give me a grenade.

51:20.806 --> 51:21.940
What are you up to?

51:22.606 --> 51:24.208
- None of your business.
- Yeah?

51:37.455 --> 51:40.324
So, you like being
under German rule, huh?

51:40.357 --> 51:41.358
Oh, no way!

51:44.029 --> 51:46.932
It wasn't my choice, you know.
I was forced.

51:48.834 --> 51:49.901
It just happened!

51:50.168 --> 51:51.670
You know what?

51:51.703 --> 51:54.271
My wife and I were going to
join the partisans,

51:54.605 --> 51:55.774
and then you came here.

52:15.894 --> 52:17.261
Comrade Captain!

52:17.528 --> 52:18.596
They got moving.

52:19.197 --> 52:20.397
They're going somewhere.

52:23.101 --> 52:24.301
Forty.

52:27.605 --> 52:28.807
And 60.

52:38.549 --> 52:40.351
Prisoner snatched.
Mission accomplished.

52:44.089 --> 52:45.356
Comrade Kovzik.

52:54.099 --> 52:56.902
That over there is the barn
where they put the machine.

52:57.535 --> 52:58.970
The one they pulled out
of the lake.

53:02.373 --> 53:03.607
They're coming for us.

53:04.743 --> 53:05.944
Looking for you.

53:06.745 --> 53:08.013
Well, I mean, for us.

53:09.114 --> 53:11.082
Stay down, all right?

53:19.891 --> 53:21.827
They're sure we're
in this grid now.

55:27.118 --> 55:28.920
Commander! They're leaving!

55:44.669 --> 55:46.204
They spotted Altynov.

55:46.638 --> 55:47.973
Good job, Sesingaly.

57:16.094 --> 57:17.095
Commander!

57:17.395 --> 57:18.630
The deminers!

57:23.868 --> 57:25.270
Look, they're checking the road.

57:26.771 --> 57:27.939
What does that mean?

57:28.339 --> 57:30.141
It means, Siavris...

57:31.409 --> 57:33.745
that right after they
check the road...

57:34.746 --> 57:37.715
they will start transporting
the launching unit.

57:45.323 --> 57:46.590
Galiyev, follow me!

59:27.792 --> 59:29.794
The wire's long enough
to reach the bank.

59:30.195 --> 59:31.863
When you attach the charge,

59:31.896 --> 59:33.698
retreat downstream, OK?

59:34.032 --> 59:35.433
Don't worry, Comrade Captain.

59:35.466 --> 59:38.002
I'm much more comfortable
in the water.

59:38.603 --> 59:41.072
I lived near the
sea, in Feodosia.

59:42.807 --> 59:44.776
Listen, you take care, Galiyev.

59:44.809 --> 59:46.711
What on earth can happen
to me, Captain?

01:03:44.115 --> 01:03:45.416
He won't make it.

01:05:19.143 --> 01:05:19.745
What?

01:06:12.296 --> 01:06:15.099
So, where's your launching unit?
Maybe it's in the wrong place?

01:06:15.466 --> 01:06:17.268
It's the right place, I swear.

01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:18.670
You see the car tracks?

01:06:19.203 --> 01:06:20.872
They had to blow up
the unit here.

01:06:21.707 --> 01:06:24.175
- I don't understand.
- What do we do now?

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:24.810
No idea.

01:06:25.509 --> 01:06:27.144
Come on, let's
spend the night here

01:06:27.178 --> 01:06:28.479
and follow the tracks tomorrow.

01:06:32.416 --> 01:06:33.417
Come on.

01:06:44.195 --> 01:06:46.464
They brought all the villagers
to reconstruct that bridge.

01:06:48.466 --> 01:06:50.167
They surely don't waste time.

01:06:51.703 --> 01:06:53.805
Maybe they won't make it
before it gets dark?

01:06:58.677 --> 01:07:00.478
Darkness isn't an obstacle.

01:07:04.382 --> 01:07:06.718
The security of the barn
has been increased.

01:07:06.752 --> 01:07:08.787
We should blow it up
with the machine inside.

01:07:10.756 --> 01:07:12.924
We used all the explosives
for the bridge.

01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:15.761
I left a box with TNT
under the seat in the truck.

01:07:15.794 --> 01:07:17.495
It's gonna be enough
for five cars.

01:07:18.229 --> 01:07:20.364
The Germans must have
found it by now.

01:07:35.279 --> 01:07:37.916
Yeah, we can't go
there in daytime.

01:07:45.256 --> 01:07:45.891
Does it hurt?

01:07:47.859 --> 01:07:48.894
It's OK.

01:07:51.295 --> 01:07:52.530
Here, take this.

01:07:54.365 --> 01:07:55.867
Will make it easier for you.

01:08:02.674 --> 01:08:04.375
- Thank you.
- Nothing to thank me for.

01:08:09.047 --> 01:08:10.716
We'll attack when it gets dark.

01:08:13.484 --> 01:08:14.518
Now, listen.

01:08:15.586 --> 01:08:16.955
If the charge is under the seat,

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:19.557
we'll blow up the
truck right there.

01:08:20.457 --> 01:08:21.459
If not...

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.929
we'll drive it further away.

01:08:26.765 --> 01:08:27.832
And then what?

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.001
And then we'll think.

01:08:30.035 --> 01:08:32.303
The Germans are gonna catch us
while we think.

01:08:32.671 --> 01:08:34.305
You better sink it.

01:08:34.337 --> 01:08:34.906
Uh huh.

01:08:35.774 --> 01:08:36.942
He already tried that.

01:08:37.943 --> 01:08:38.910
Not the best option.

01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:41.779
You had to sink it in our swamp.

01:08:42.313 --> 01:08:45.448
There's a swamp here. It's about
eight or nine kilometers away.

01:08:45.483 --> 01:08:48.285
A farm tractor sunk
there in 1939.

01:08:48.953 --> 01:08:50.689
It was gone in the blink
of an eye,

01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:52.622
both the tractor and a
trailer.

01:08:52.657 --> 01:08:55.426
My nephew Pasha, the driver,
God bless his soul,

01:08:55.894 --> 01:08:57.428
had no chance of getting out.

01:08:59.529 --> 01:09:00.765
Can we drive there?

01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:03.702
Yes, there's a corduroy.

01:09:03.734 --> 01:09:04.736
A what?

01:09:06.004 --> 01:09:08.774
It's a log path, right
over the swamp.

01:09:10.374 --> 01:09:10.975
All right.

01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:14.511
We'll go to the swamp.

01:09:15.247 --> 01:09:17.348
We have to take down
the sentries quietly.

01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:20.584
I'll do it without a sound.

01:09:21.019 --> 01:09:22.520
From 50 meters or so.

01:09:25.991 --> 01:09:27.291
All right, then.

01:09:29.027 --> 01:09:30.996
We have no choice. We'll
have to attack.

01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:33.064
After it gets dark.

01:09:54.085 --> 01:09:55.419
Here, put it on.

01:09:55.954 --> 01:09:57.321
It's getting cold.

01:09:58.824 --> 01:09:59.858
Thank you.

01:10:03.662 --> 01:10:06.363
- Hey, don't overcook it!
- It didn't even boil yet.

01:10:11.402 --> 01:10:12.469
Moshkin.

01:10:13.171 --> 01:10:15.073
And I thought my last
name was funny,

01:10:15.506 --> 01:10:16.975
until I met Moshkin.

01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:21.012
What is your last name?

01:10:24.515 --> 01:10:25.616
Fedia Knysh.

01:10:26.718 --> 01:10:28.119
People laughed at me.

01:10:29.054 --> 01:10:30.155
Well, they still do.

01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:33.024
They say I'll hardly get a wife
with such a last name.

01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:37.662
"Pish, pish. Fedia Knysh."

01:10:38.763 --> 01:10:40.364
Sounds good for a scarecrow.

01:10:43.702 --> 01:10:45.136
It's boiling already!

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.537
Take it off the fire!

01:10:48.472 --> 01:10:49.473
Come on, come on!

01:10:51.176 --> 01:10:52.110
All right, all right.

01:10:53.044 --> 01:10:55.013
Good. Looks good, huh, guys?

01:10:57.949 --> 01:10:58.950
There, there.

01:11:04.122 --> 01:11:05.522
It's overcooked.

01:11:13.798 --> 01:11:14.799
Here.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.435
- What about you?
- Later.

01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:21.139
Thank you.

01:12:26.271 --> 01:12:27.706
Galiyev is so lucky.

01:12:30.175 --> 01:12:31.142
He was an orphan.

01:12:32.978 --> 01:12:34.646
No one to be notified.

01:12:37.148 --> 01:12:39.751
I can only imagine
what would happen to my parents

01:12:40.551 --> 01:12:42.486
if they got a death
notice about me.

01:12:46.324 --> 01:12:48.226
Dad's got heart
problems, and Mom...

01:12:52.596 --> 01:12:56.533
I didn't even get a chance
to say my goodbyes.

01:12:58.569 --> 01:13:01.505
My brother was about to get
married, and I came here.

01:13:04.976 --> 01:13:07.278
And my aunt promised
to give me

01:13:07.312 --> 01:13:10.148
her wedding ring
when I get married.

01:13:12.317 --> 01:13:14.551
She got it from
her great-grandma.

01:13:16.287 --> 01:13:19.090
Rings are just a
bourgeois relic.

01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:21.993
- Really?
- Mmhmm.

01:13:22.694 --> 01:13:24.729
I guess that depends
on the bride.

01:13:36.041 --> 01:13:37.574
You got a family?

01:13:37.608 --> 01:13:38.777
I'm a bigamist.

01:13:39.411 --> 01:13:41.246
I've got one family
in the village

01:13:41.279 --> 01:13:42.847
and one family in
the city.

01:13:43.148 --> 01:13:45.183
My wife was to give
birth in July.

01:13:45.216 --> 01:13:47.819
I don't know what it is -
a boy or a girl.

01:13:48.619 --> 01:13:49.654
Your parents?

01:13:49.687 --> 01:13:53.058
No. They... The typhoid took
them in the '20s.

01:13:53.291 --> 01:13:54.292
And yours?

01:13:55.693 --> 01:13:57.228
My mom's in Leningrad.

01:13:57.629 --> 01:14:00.298
Oh. The Germans won't get
us there, for sure.

01:14:44.742 --> 01:14:45.710
Come on.

01:14:57.856 --> 01:14:59.858
Subbotina, take the weapon.

01:14:59.891 --> 01:15:02.093
Belous, take up defense.

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:09.634
No, wait!

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.239
Come on! Siavris!

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.344
Siavris!

01:15:52.343 --> 01:15:54.245
What's in there? The
explosives?

01:15:57.148 --> 01:15:58.149
It's empty.

01:15:59.784 --> 01:16:00.752
No explosives.

01:16:01.286 --> 01:16:03.721
Start it. We're leaving.

01:16:03.755 --> 01:16:05.356
Comrade Captain, turn it, sir.

01:16:08.293 --> 01:16:09.694
Give me light, Kovzik.

01:16:22.941 --> 01:16:23.775
Hold it!

01:16:28.012 --> 01:16:29.080
I need light.

01:16:30.381 --> 01:16:31.416
Just a sec.

01:16:34.419 --> 01:16:35.987
OK, OK, OK.

01:16:37.922 --> 01:16:39.490
Now I know why it didn't start.

01:16:40.792 --> 01:16:42.160
They didn't know we connect

01:16:42.193 --> 01:16:44.929
plus to the ground and
minus to the circuit.

01:16:44.963 --> 01:16:46.264
Just a second.

01:17:09.988 --> 01:17:12.423
- Come on, Siavris! Hurry!
- Almost done.

01:17:27.538 --> 01:17:29.240
- You OK?
- I'm fine!

01:17:39.884 --> 01:17:41.019
The ammo!

01:17:41.619 --> 01:17:42.487
Vika!

01:17:44.522 --> 01:17:46.524
All right, I'm almost done.

01:18:25.496 --> 01:18:27.165
I'm done! Now, turn it again.

01:18:32.003 --> 01:18:33.004
It's working!

01:20:11.737 --> 01:20:12.937
What is it?

01:20:18.109 --> 01:20:19.977
That's it. We're done.

01:20:21.345 --> 01:20:22.648
We're all out of petrol.

01:21:41.325 --> 01:21:42.728
It's no use.

01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:45.329
I told you, there's no petrol.

01:21:47.098 --> 01:21:48.232
- Siavris.
- What?

01:21:49.033 --> 01:21:51.102
- Get behind the wheel.
- What for?

01:21:51.536 --> 01:21:53.170
We'll take the truck
to the galley.

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.508
Come on, Kovzik, push it.

01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:01.078
Don't worry, we'll make it.

01:22:14.893 --> 01:22:16.360
Come on.

01:22:19.564 --> 01:22:22.099
Come on, come on, come on!

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.110
That's it.

01:22:34.412 --> 01:22:35.413
Enough.

01:22:38.316 --> 01:22:39.317
Kovzik!

01:22:54.633 --> 01:22:55.801
Where's Kovzik?

01:22:58.937 --> 01:22:59.805
He's gone.

01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:19.590
Hey, you, come here.

01:23:30.601 --> 01:23:32.638
I don't understand.
<i>Nicht verschtein.</i>

01:23:33.137 --> 01:23:34.171
Officer, I'm going home.

01:23:34.205 --> 01:23:36.808
I was at my goddaughter's
party in that village.

01:23:49.821 --> 01:23:51.188
I don't understand.

01:23:52.824 --> 01:23:54.558
Where are the saboteurs?

01:24:05.837 --> 01:24:06.838
Tell me, man.

01:24:08.006 --> 01:24:10.942
You don't think this machine is
worth more than the kids' lives?

01:24:11.575 --> 01:24:15.246
If this unit falls into enemy
hands, it will take more lives.

01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:16.882
- We have an order.
- An order!

01:24:18.349 --> 01:24:20.184
They're kids, for God's sake!

01:24:20.518 --> 01:24:22.319
Have you ever had kids
in your life?

01:24:25.356 --> 01:24:26.424
I had...

01:24:27.425 --> 01:24:28.426
a son.

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:30.294
He died?

01:24:31.562 --> 01:24:32.631
He was killed.

01:24:33.564 --> 01:24:34.633
My wife, too.

01:24:35.767 --> 01:24:37.903
When our outpost was bombed.

01:24:43.041 --> 01:24:43.875
I'm sorry.

01:24:48.379 --> 01:24:49.447
And now what?

01:25:45.436 --> 01:25:46.437
Moshkin!

01:25:46.805 --> 01:25:48.640
Moshkin! Moshkin, get up!

01:25:49.708 --> 01:25:51.308
- Come on!
- What is it?

01:25:54.012 --> 01:25:55.013
Move it!

01:27:14.993 --> 01:27:15.994
So?

01:27:16.895 --> 01:27:17.929
That's it.

01:27:47.659 --> 01:27:49.460
- Comrade Commander!
- Knysh!

01:27:49.493 --> 01:27:50.128
It's me!

01:27:51.763 --> 01:27:53.999
- Ninety-nine!
- And one, Knysh!

01:27:54.598 --> 01:27:56.835
- I brought help!
- Private Moshkin!

01:28:08.512 --> 01:28:09.413
It's Kovzik!

01:29:00.098 --> 01:29:01.166
Open the door!

01:29:06.071 --> 01:29:08.173
Make sure you tie it down tight.

01:29:20.819 --> 01:29:22.553
- Thank you.
- God bless you.

01:29:22.954 --> 01:29:23.955
Gee!

01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.991
Giddyap!

01:29:26.891 --> 01:29:27.892
Gee!

01:29:29.227 --> 01:29:30.228
Giddyap!

01:29:34.032 --> 01:29:35.599
Wait! Wait!

01:29:35.633 --> 01:29:37.702
Whoa.

01:29:37.736 --> 01:29:39.270
Wait for me! I'll go with you!

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.241
I'll come back for you.

01:29:44.142 --> 01:29:45.542
I swear I will.

01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:46.911
Gee!

01:29:47.245 --> 01:29:48.246
Giddyap!

01:29:48.947 --> 01:29:50.115
Gee!

01:29:50.148 --> 01:29:51.783
- Giddyap!
- Fyodor!

01:29:52.583 --> 01:29:54.052
- Gee!
- Fyodor!

01:29:56.955 --> 01:29:59.290
You have a good name! Do
you hear me?

01:30:00.892 --> 01:30:02.260
It will be OK!

01:30:04.262 --> 01:30:06.264
And I don't think it's
funny at all.

01:30:07.799 --> 01:30:08.800
Gee!

01:30:12.103 --> 01:30:13.238
Whoa.

01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:21.612
Now we'll make it for sure.

01:30:23.448 --> 01:30:24.949
Start it, Knysh!

01:30:31.389 --> 01:30:33.158
Done!

01:30:34.159 --> 01:30:35.293
Now, go! We'll cover you!

01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:36.861
All right!

01:30:57.215 --> 01:30:58.316
Let's go!

01:31:17.936 --> 01:31:19.170
What is it, Commander?

01:31:19.504 --> 01:31:20.839
I don't know.

01:31:21.773 --> 01:31:23.308
I can't feel my legs.

01:31:26.845 --> 01:31:28.612
Oh, my God!

01:31:34.853 --> 01:31:36.287
Come on, let's switch places.

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:53.805
Can you take care
of switching gears?

01:31:53.838 --> 01:31:54.372
Yeah.

01:31:54.405 --> 01:31:55.707
Then right into second.

01:32:11.456 --> 01:32:13.158
- Gee!
- Head to the glade!

01:32:13.191 --> 01:32:14.392
They won't make it through!

01:32:14.893 --> 01:32:17.362
- Gee!
- Come on, to the right! Come on!

01:32:17.395 --> 01:32:18.396
Gee!

01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:20.131
- Come on, faster!
- Gee!

01:33:06.177 --> 01:33:07.445
Hey! Hey!

01:33:07.879 --> 01:33:10.782
Knysh! Knysh! You OK?

01:33:10.815 --> 01:33:12.483
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:33:12.917 --> 01:33:14.786
- I'm fine.
- Where's the group?

01:33:14.819 --> 01:33:15.920
- I'm fine
- Where's the...

01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:06.531
Into first, then.

01:37:42.405 --> 01:37:47.405
