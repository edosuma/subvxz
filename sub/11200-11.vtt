WEBVTT

00:02.302 --> 00:04.896
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.599
LAM: About three hours ago
he came in complaining of fatigue.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.175
It's a Prior plague.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.301
Let Origin show you the way.

00:11.411 --> 00:14.676
I vow to spread the word of the Ori
to all Jaffa.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.043
-Who are you?
-It's me, Orlin.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.448
LAM: As far as I can tell,
he's a normal human adolescent.

00:19.553 --> 00:23.250
Who claims he's an Ancient who
has descended and taken human form.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.984
Orlin seems to have hit a dead end
with his work on a cure.

00:26.093 --> 00:29.859
What he needs is a blood sample from
the Prior who infected Lieutenant Fisher.

00:29.963 --> 00:32.261
Orlin's attempt to find a cure
isn't the only reason to do this.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.333
You wanna try and turn this Prior.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.561
We believe we may be close
to developing a technology

00:36.670 --> 00:38.570
that could inhibit a Prior's special abilities.

00:38.672 --> 00:45.305
The Ori do not require blind obedience.
They will show you their power.

00:51.585 --> 00:56.113
GERAK: Like you, my judgment was
clouded by suspicion and distrust.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.885
But the Ori sensed my misgivings,

00:58.992 --> 01:02.894
forgave me my weaknesses
and showed me their power.

01:03.263 --> 01:07.393
I stand before you today
as proof of their divine might.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.859
They have poisoned your mind.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.273
The Ori's promises are hollow.

01:14.641 --> 01:18.304
We have learned from the Ancients that
they are not ascending their followers.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.436
Do you expect us
to take your word for this?

01:20.547 --> 01:23.311
One of the Ancients
returned to human form to warn us

01:23.416 --> 01:27.716
that the Ori gain strength
by sapping the power from their followers.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.119
That is why they seek our support.

01:31.725 --> 01:37.561
The Ori are not some benevolent gods
offering you the path of enlightenment.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.659
They are but manipulative beings
who will use you and discard you

01:42.769 --> 01:44.396
-once you have served their purpose.
-Enough.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.405
They are no better than the Goa'uld.

01:47.507 --> 01:48.599
Enough!

01:49.442 --> 01:51.137
The Goa'uld are impostors.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.508
But the Ori...

01:54.681 --> 01:55.875
The Ori

01:57.450 --> 01:58.815
are the real gods.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.382
Behold the gift

02:03.256 --> 02:05.019
the Ori have bestowed upon me.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.203
LAM: We had three fatalities this morning.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.407
We have another 12 base personnel
who are in critical condition

02:29.516 --> 02:32.314
and probably won't make it
past the next 24 hours.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.611
That's it?

02:33.920 --> 02:37.048
They've been given sedatives
and are resting comfortably.

02:37.224 --> 02:40.193
There's nothing you or anyone
can do for them right now.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.091
-I can go see them.
-No, you can't.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.658
You're exhausted
and you've already got a lot on your plate.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.758
Those people are serving
under my command.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.300
-Sir.
-What is it, Walter?

02:52.405 --> 02:54.202
As of 0800 this morning,

02:54.307 --> 02:59.768
the CDC reports confirmed cases
of the virus in both Mexico and Canada.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.609
We could be looking at a global pandemic.

04:13.887 --> 04:14.945
(DOOR OPENING)

04:15.155 --> 04:17.646
Jolan. It's good to see a familiar face.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.018
Lord Haikon wishes to see you.

04:22.495 --> 04:23.928
Let's rock 'n' roll.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.937
It was foolish of you to come.

04:37.043 --> 04:38.874
The others are distrustful of you.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.844
Yeah, I kind of got that.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.683
-ls there anything else I need to know?
-Haikon will have your answers.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.756
Welcome, Mitchell.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.261
Thank you, Haikon.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.526
Please, sit.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.601
I apologize for making you wait,

05:09.809 --> 05:14.041
but I just came back from a mission
of great importance.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.513
We were informed
of a world of non-believers

05:16.616 --> 05:18.777
who were conspiring against the Ori.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.318
The Prior dispatched us to deal with them.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.119
You mean kill them.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.383
Well, we were told
they posed a considerable threat.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.726
"Leave not the smallest pebble
in the road,

05:31.831 --> 05:34.561
"for any hindrance
will slow your people's progress."

05:34.667 --> 05:36.134
So said the Prior.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.466
Yeah, the Priors say a lot of things.

05:38.838 --> 05:44.242
Look, I'm the last person to criticize
someone for what they believe, but...

05:44.344 --> 05:48.678
If your intention is to convince me
to withdraw support from the Ori,

05:48.782 --> 05:50.249
you need not bother.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.581
-You're making a big...
-I've already decided as much.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.119
What?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.257
We went to the planet,
as the Prior instructed.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.519
Two hundred strong,
to eliminate any threat.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.524
We were expecting an army.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.428
What we found were simple farmers,

06:07.233 --> 06:09.861
too naive to understand
the consequences they faced

06:09.969 --> 06:11.960
for daring to defy the Ori.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.836
The Sodan are proud warriors.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.670
We do not kill innocent people.

06:16.776 --> 06:19.973
-So you didn't follow through?
-We left them unharmed.

06:20.513 --> 06:23.073
But before returning here,
we had to put all doubts to rest,

06:23.183 --> 06:26.516
so we traveled to another world,
one rumored to have refused the Ori.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.985
The entire civilization was decimated

06:33.726 --> 06:35.751
by a mysterious plague.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.961
There was no one left.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.601
Yeah, that's what they do.

06:43.303 --> 06:47.137
In fact, they're doing it on Earth
right now, as we speak.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.102
And it'll probably happen here
when the Prior gets back

06:50.210 --> 06:52.440
and finds out you didn't obey his orders.

06:52.545 --> 06:55.810
How can we resist so powerful an enemy?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.242
Well, I can tell you,

06:59.986 --> 07:02.250
but you're probably not gonna like it.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.235
-Orlin.
-Sam.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.666
Are you all right?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.904
I'm fine.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.209
It's you I'm worried about.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.075
We just got your test results back.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.851
They show significant
and progressive changes

07:33.953 --> 07:35.386
in different areas of your brain.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.187
What kind of changes?

07:38.725 --> 07:42.456
A degenerative process that's already
started to impair your cognitive functions.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.022
I knew that when I took on human form

07:47.200 --> 07:49.725
the memories I brought with me
would eventually fade.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.134
That's only part of it.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.798
It's not so much a result
of your losing the memories,

07:57.143 --> 08:00.271
but more a consequence
of your trying to hold on to them.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.811
Orlin, by not letting go
of the Ancient knowledge,

08:04.517 --> 08:06.075
you're damaging your brain.

08:06.186 --> 08:11.886
Yes. My human mind is failing
under the weight of so much information.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.657
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

08:15.695 --> 08:18.289
As an Ancient,
how could you not have known?

08:19.065 --> 08:22.557
Of course I knew, Sam,
but I had no choice.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.904
But you have a choice now.

08:25.605 --> 08:29.132
Your brain is fighting a losing battle,
stripping away whatever it can

08:29.242 --> 08:32.439
in an attempt to salvage the memories
related to the cure.

08:32.912 --> 08:36.473
Give them up and you could stop this
from progressing any further.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.414
I can't do that. There's too much at stake.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.912
You have the memories.

08:42.088 --> 08:43.419
Write them down.

08:43.723 --> 08:47.215
Give me the instructions.
I'll complete the vaccine.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.788
It's too complex.
You won't fully understand the process.

08:50.897 --> 08:51.886
Try me.

08:51.998 --> 08:56.697
Orlin, you don't have to sacrifice yourself.
Let go before it's too late.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.733
I can't risk entrusting this job
to anyone but myself.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.342
I have to see this through, Sam.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.240
I'm sorry.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.262
-We're good.
-JACKSON: Okay.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.799
This device will emit
a high ultrasonic frequency

09:29.902 --> 09:31.767
targeting a specific portion
of the Prior's brain,

09:31.871 --> 09:34.203
temporarily blocking his ability
to use his powers.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.798
Now, the good news is
it won't have any effect on us.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.003
The bad news is it may not have
any effect on the Prior either.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.479
In order for this thing
to work the way we want it to,

09:42.582 --> 09:45.176
it has to be broadcasting
on the correct frequency.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.812
Unfortunately, we don't know
what that frequency is,

09:48.921 --> 09:51.287
so we'll use a trial-and-error approach.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.656
This remote allows us to adjust the signal,

09:54.961 --> 09:57.088
and sooner or later, we'll get the right one.

09:57.196 --> 10:00.165
-Any questions thus far?
-How will we know when it is working?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.962
Well, we'll know when the Prior's
no longer able to use his powers.

10:03.069 --> 10:06.163
How will we know he'll no longer
be able to use his powers?

10:06.272 --> 10:11.209
Well, someone is just gonna have to test it
and find out.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.882
Don't worry, fellas, that someone is me.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.545
MlTCHELL: So, it's simple.
We disable the Prior,

10:21.654 --> 10:23.815
we take a sample of his blood,
we send it back to the SGC,

10:23.923 --> 10:25.322
they finish the cure,

10:25.425 --> 10:29.225
we turn the Prior against the Ori,
and call it a day.

10:29.862 --> 10:31.796
-Jackson, you're driving.
-Yay.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.833
SG-22, I want you in defensive positions
around the perimeter.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.232
There, there, there and there.

10:38.237 --> 10:41.764
There's one other small problem.

10:41.941 --> 10:45.809
We're not exactly certain what the range
of that device is, so, Haikon,

10:46.913 --> 10:48.904
I need you to get the Prior
as close as possible.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.180
-ls that a problem?
-No.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.251
No, it is not.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.086
You are confident that this will work?

11:02.862 --> 11:06.195
Well, if it doesn't work,
we're out of options.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.765
I feel we have lost them.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.864
This battle is far from over.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.136
But clearly, the Council was swayed.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.178
The task before us is daunting,
but not impossible.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.272
The Jaffa nation has no appetite for war,

11:24.384 --> 11:26.011
particularly one that threatens
to divide us.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.019
Indeed, that much is certain.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.914
The Ori, on the other hand,
will not abide opposition.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.186
They have already ordered Gerak
to quell the dissension within our ranks.

11:34.293 --> 11:38.093
Then we must retreat into the shadows
and evade their attempts to find us.

11:38.197 --> 11:42.566
No. We must make a stand, on Chulak.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.568
Faced with the prospect of inciting
a civil war that would kill millions,

11:46.672 --> 11:49.334
the Council will be left
with an impossible choice,

11:49.442 --> 11:53.572
but ultimately, they must decide
between the Ori and their fellow Jaffa.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.705
It is only by forcing their hand
that they will see reason.

11:56.816 --> 12:00.047
-So I believe.
-An enterprise this bold

12:00.153 --> 12:01.745
will require much support.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.288
Then let us gather a fleet
to defend Chulak.

12:20.473 --> 12:24.204
It's like catching a glimpse of someone
from the corner of your eye

12:24.811 --> 12:27.644
then turning around and they're gone.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.908
You begin to doubt whether you actually
ever saw them in the first place.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.251
Tell me, Sam,

12:38.357 --> 12:41.155
how can you regret losing a memory
you can't even remember?

12:47.033 --> 12:48.466
What are you working on?

12:49.502 --> 12:51.834
Your instructions for assembling the cure,

12:51.938 --> 12:55.806
in the event I am too incapacitated
to complete it myself.

12:56.976 --> 13:00.878
It's a precaution we have to take.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.946
The most frustrating part in all this

13:05.051 --> 13:09.818
is I am unable to control what I can
hold on to, even for a little while.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.521
Crucial information I need to finish
the cure is slipping through my fingers

13:14.894 --> 13:18.625
while insignificant minutia
of my experience as an Ancient

13:18.731 --> 13:20.699
is still fresh and clear in my mind.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.701
In time, I'll lose it all, but for now

13:23.970 --> 13:26.302
it just doesn't seem fair.

13:29.041 --> 13:32.340
-ls there anything I can do to help?
-No.

13:33.479 --> 13:38.382
At this point, it's best if I work alone.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.965
WOMAN ON T.V. :
Despite the best efforts of all involved,

13:56.068 --> 13:58.901
the virus continues to spread
at an alarming rate.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.838
The CDC advises anyone
who suspects they ha ve the virus

14:01.941 --> 14:04.068
or may ha ve come in contact
with someone who did,

14:04.176 --> 14:05.234
to quarantine themselves...

14:05.344 --> 14:08.575
Sir. Just received word that China,
Great Britain, and Russia

14:08.681 --> 14:12.014
have grounded all air travel
and closed their ports to foreign ships.

14:12.118 --> 14:15.144
This is out of control,
and it's only gonna get worse.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.449
And according
to General Hammond's office,

14:17.557 --> 14:20.082
our allies have expressed concern
about the cover story.

14:20.192 --> 14:23.855
Specifically, how long
we can continue to maintain it.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.399
They've requested a meeting with you.

14:26.399 --> 14:26.831
They've requested a meeting with you.

14:30.836 --> 14:35.273
So, it is your estimation then, General,
that the decision to send SG-6

14:35.374 --> 14:37.467
to that particular planet
was the right one?

14:37.577 --> 14:42.014
As evidenced by this plague, we have
no viable defense against the Ori.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.675
The purpose of the mission to 656

14:44.784 --> 14:48.083
was to gather intelligence
that might help us in that respect.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.850
But admittedly, the mission was
a failure in the worst possible way

14:51.958 --> 14:56.156
and as a result, millions,
perhaps billions, will lose their lives.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.356
The newly appointed liaison
between Stargate Command

14:59.465 --> 15:00.989
and the lnternational Committee

15:01.100 --> 15:03.762
was informed of,
and signed off on the mission.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.167
Your representative agreed
it was the right call.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.537
There is some concern
that Mr. Woolsey may not have been

15:09.642 --> 15:12.076
fully apprised of all
the possible ramifications.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.373
Now, to his credit, he still supports your
decision.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.744
The Ori were gonna strike at us
sooner or later.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.680
And rather than sit back and wait for it,

15:18.784 --> 15:21.878
we were out there looking for a way to
stop them, to stop this from happening.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.286
And to start pointing fingers
at such a crucial...

15:24.390 --> 15:26.017
General. General Landry!

15:26.125 --> 15:29.424
The purpose of this meeting
is not to assign blame

15:29.528 --> 15:32.725
but to arrive at a better understanding
of how this happened

15:32.832 --> 15:36.495
and conversely, to avoid something
like this ever happening again.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.002
That's provided we get a second chance.

15:39.105 --> 15:43.235
Presently, we have no way
of stopping this virus.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.966
People are dying

15:46.579 --> 15:49.275
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.412
What you propose is madness.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.079
So it may seem.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.383
But if the Council believes
that we are mad

16:00.493 --> 16:04.623
and cannot be dissuaded from sacrificing
our lives, then all the better.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.665
We must stake everything
on the belief that in the end,

16:07.767 --> 16:09.792
the Council will value
the lives of their brothers

16:09.902 --> 16:12.370
over the empty promises of the Ori.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.699
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

16:17.410 --> 16:19.742
Time is short, brother.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.539
We must gather our forces,

16:21.647 --> 16:25.549
for the bigger our army, the more lives
that Gerak must choose to take.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.484
We must make this decision
as difficult as we can for him.

16:28.587 --> 16:31.351
Gerak's no longer one of us.
He is a Prior now.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.288
Gerak may be a Prior,

16:33.392 --> 16:36.452
but I have no doubt
that part of him remains Jaffa

16:36.562 --> 16:39.087
and that is the part we must seek out.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.398
I still believe this plan to be madness.

16:43.636 --> 16:47.197
But then,
I once considered the very notion

16:47.306 --> 16:49.774
of defeating the Goa'uld a mere fantasy.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.536
Prove me wrong yet again, Teal'c.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.808
You have my support.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.049
Thank you, brother.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.388
He's on his way.

17:13.499 --> 17:14.659
MITCHELL: Jackson.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.532
Ready.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.542
All right, everybody, sit tight.

17:24.977 --> 17:28.208
Wait for my signal.
Remember, we need this guy alive.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.221
You went to the planet,
as I had asked of you.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.795
HAlKON: We did.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.958
And yet the non-believers still live.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.427
They do.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.998
Why have you disobeyed
the will of the Ori?

17:55.841 --> 17:59.641
Because we take orders from no one.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.646
The Ori offer you
enlightenment, immortality.

18:03.048 --> 18:06.609
Even if that were true,
their price is too high.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.748
What they ask of us goes against
the very spirit of the Sodan.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.188
You doubt the power of the Ori.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.589
It is not their power that we doubt,

18:15.895 --> 18:17.920
it's their worthiness as gods.

18:19.398 --> 18:20.490
(BEEPS)

18:25.070 --> 18:26.298
That's not it.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.006
Not it either.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.952
"Andras chose to hunt the lion
and was eaten by his prey."

18:47.159 --> 18:48.786
Come on.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.390
It was unwise of you to challenge me.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.194
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't mind another crack at it.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.864
What did you hope to achieve
by attacking me?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.999
Did you honestly believe
it was possible to capture me?

19:04.543 --> 19:06.204
Well, that was the plan.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.036
And what purpose
would that have served?

19:12.218 --> 19:13.310
(CHOKING)

19:41.313 --> 19:43.781
-George.
-Hank, how was the grilling?

19:43.983 --> 19:48.317
Medium rare.
I just got off the phone with the CDC.

19:48.754 --> 19:52.815
A flight left Salt Lake City three days
after the contagion was identified.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.520
It made a stopover at O'Hare before
continuing on to its final destination,

19:56.629 --> 19:58.119
Charles de Gaulle Airport.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.222
You're telling me the virus
has already reached Paris?

20:01.667 --> 20:05.433
Three of the people on that flight
have tested positive for the virus.

20:05.638 --> 20:09.540
French authorities are doing all they can
to track down the passengers, flight crew,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.735
any ground crew or airport personnel

20:11.844 --> 20:13.402
that may have come
in contact with them.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.343
And anyone who came
in contact with them,

20:15.447 --> 20:17.972
and anyone who came in contact
with those people.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.449
You know,
at the rate this thing is traveling,

20:20.552 --> 20:23.419
in three days it'll hit the Middle East.
Six days, it'll be in China.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.980
Stock market has already taken a dive,
and people are panicking.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.353
If this thing spreads far enough
and does enough damage,

20:30.462 --> 20:33.124
it could start destabilizing governments.

20:33.866 --> 20:37.393
We're going to have to be prepared
for any and all possibilities.

20:59.725 --> 21:03.593
Yeah, we took the liberty of borrowing
a sample of your blood.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.526
Hope you don't mind.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.024
You looking for this?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.404
Whoa!

21:13.138 --> 21:15.868
No. It's not gonna work.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.740
That warm,
fuzzy feeling you're experiencing

21:18.844 --> 21:21.142
may be the effects of a device
that's inhibiting your ability

21:21.246 --> 21:23.180
to concentrate and focus your powers.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.341
Symptoms may include dizziness,

21:25.451 --> 21:26.318
-irritability...
-Nausea.

21:26.318 --> 21:27.148
-irritability...
-Nausea.

21:27.252 --> 21:30.710
...mild nausea, and a condition
known as "hot-dog fingers".

21:30.823 --> 21:33.257
It makes no difference what you do to me.

21:33.692 --> 21:34.989
But know this,

21:35.728 --> 21:37.491
the Ori are all-seeing.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.724
They are already aware of this affront
to their eminence

21:42.901 --> 21:46.393
and shall strike down those
who dare to defy them.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.771
-Nothing yet. You?
-Drawing a blank.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.134
Little thirsty.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.506
-That doesn't count.
-No, it doesn't.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.103
Their movements
are not so easily divined,

21:56.215 --> 21:59.013
their ways unseen and veiled in mystery.

21:59.118 --> 22:02.178
Right, right. They have a plan.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.414
I don't suppose you wanna tell us
what that is.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.424
Why did they send you to this galaxy
in the first place?

22:07.526 --> 22:09.858
We are beacons on the road
to enlightenment.

22:09.962 --> 22:13.523
No. You're dark-side intergalactic
encyclopedia salesmen.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.465
Unfortunately, the home office
hasn't been quite up front with you.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.126
-Nice work on the metaphor.
-Thank you.

22:19.538 --> 22:23.804
For starters, did you know
that the Ori need people to worship them

22:23.909 --> 22:26.036
because that's how they gain their power?

22:26.745 --> 22:28.474
-He didn't know.
-No, he didn't know that.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.706
No, it's true.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.978
We're not exactly sure how it works,
but from what I've heard,

22:33.085 --> 22:36.145
they actually drain power
from their followers.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.745
That's why they need worshippers.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.847
You should talk to them about it
next time you're home.

22:39.958 --> 22:42.085
They might do a better job
of explaining the process to you.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.660
Ours is not to question, but to rejoice
in their service, for they are perfection.

22:46.398 --> 22:51.062
No, not really, because a perfect being
wouldn't need to lie

22:51.170 --> 22:53.604
to ensure the loyalty of their followers.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.297
They wouldn't need
to promise you Ascension

22:55.407 --> 22:57.875
if they had no intention of delivering it.

23:00.279 --> 23:03.339
"Those who follow the path of
righteousness shall be raised up high."

23:03.449 --> 23:06.009
No, they won't,

23:06.518 --> 23:09.612
because the Ori do not share power.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.281
They're using you.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.221
"Pity not the blind man,

23:17.296 --> 23:19.992
"for he is hindered
not by the visions of this world,

23:20.099 --> 23:23.762
-"but rather, pity yourselves."
-Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.767
"For he shall see the light before you."

23:27.005 --> 23:28.370
I'm gonna get something to eat.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.123
Orlin.

23:49.728 --> 23:50.820
Damn it.

23:50.996 --> 23:51.985
(ALARM BLARING)

23:52.097 --> 23:53.997
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.293
No, no, he is not fine.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.425
-Colonel...
-He hasn 't been fine in two days.

23:57.536 --> 24:00.505
He has demonstrated Iapses in judgment
that put everyone in this room at risk.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.766
Colonel, that is enough.

24:04.643 --> 24:07.077
No, he's right, Sam.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.874
I can 't help you anymore.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.846
I'm just in the way here.

24:31.703 --> 24:34.729
Reflecting on your ill-spent youth,
old man?

24:37.176 --> 24:39.371
In truth, I was thinking of you.

24:41.346 --> 24:43.007
If this gamble succeeds,

24:43.248 --> 24:45.375
you will have once again proven yourself
a great leader.

24:47.286 --> 24:50.983
Perhaps the only one capable
of uniting this fractured Jaffa nation.

24:53.725 --> 24:56.250
My heart is indeed with our people,

24:56.361 --> 25:00.388
but as long as the Ori threaten this galaxy,
my place is with SG-1.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.898
I understand.

25:04.703 --> 25:07.604
Even so,
there is no doubt we are the poorer for it.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.205
I disagree.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.571
After our great victory this day,

25:12.678 --> 25:14.737
Gerak's influence
over our people shall wane.

25:16.081 --> 25:19.642
Then our nation will rally
under the command of a great leader.

25:20.819 --> 25:23.549
That is, if he has the courage
to accept the challenge.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.159
-Me?
-Who better?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.517
Tell me.

25:30.929 --> 25:33.523
No. There are many others.

25:33.632 --> 25:35.793
There are many others
who covet the position,

25:35.901 --> 25:39.667
but none who possess the strength
and wisdom only you can offer.

25:40.973 --> 25:45.410
It was not too long ago
we faced a similarly impossible task,

25:45.711 --> 25:49.772
and yet, on that day, despite the odds,

25:50.215 --> 25:53.673
we finally ended generations
of oppression and struggle

25:53.785 --> 25:56.549
by securing victory over Ba'al's fleet.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.583
I remember standing on the peltac
of that mothership

26:02.661 --> 26:07.291
just as I am doing now,
waiting for the battle to begin,

26:08.233 --> 26:12.135
yet knowing, no matter what the outcome,

26:12.971 --> 26:17.305
it would be the last time I would
have to take the life of a fellow Jaffa.

26:21.179 --> 26:24.148
No Jaffa blood will be spilled on this day.

26:26.618 --> 26:28.848
On that you have my word.

26:40.932 --> 26:44.368
Sir, we have confirmed cases in Bonn,
Amsterdam, Rome and Madrid.

26:44.469 --> 26:46.664
We have suspected cases
in London and Athens.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.569
The WHO has teams en route.

26:48.674 --> 26:51.939
Meanwhile, there are suspected cases
on the African continent.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.138
Some of the military leaders in the region
have already declared martial law.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.805
Thank you, Chief.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.780
-Colonel, how are things progressing?
-They're not, sir.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.854
As you know, the contagion's
rapidly mutating nature necessitated

27:02.954 --> 27:06.082
our acquiring a specimen of DNA
from the original virus.

27:06.191 --> 27:09.217
We finally managed to get a blood sample
from the Prior who started the plague,

27:09.328 --> 27:11.990
but so far it hasn't helped.
It looks like we've hit a dead end.

27:12.097 --> 27:14.565
Let's hope "looks like"
is the operative sentiment here.

27:14.666 --> 27:15.928
Yes, sir.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.402
Orlin? Sorry to disturb you.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.672
Not at all, General. Please.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.742
I'd like to thank you
for everything you've done.

27:34.853 --> 27:37.481
I wish it could have been more.

27:37.589 --> 27:41.582
You got us as far along as you could,
the rest is gonna have to be up to us.

27:41.693 --> 27:42.853
Orlin,

27:43.562 --> 27:46.656
I realize I have no right to ask this of you,

27:47.599 --> 27:50.261
but there is something else
you might be able to do for us.

27:59.711 --> 28:02.509
Numerous vessels dropping out
of hyperspace.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.928
You're outnumbered.

28:23.268 --> 28:25.862
Retreat is no Ionger an option.

28:26.171 --> 28:28.196
I do not want to slaughter you,

28:28.907 --> 28:31.398
but I will if you give me no choice.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.574
So, what say you, Teal'c?

28:44.322 --> 28:48.224
I still have hope this situation
can be peacefully resolved, Gerak.

28:48.593 --> 28:50.891
Let us meet on the planet's surface
to discuss.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.225
Very well.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.204
It's a Norwegian cheese, I think.

29:04.309 --> 29:07.403
It's spelled with a "G" or a "J,"
maybe both.

29:07.512 --> 29:10.447
"Jgehost," "Gjehost," something like that.

29:10.549 --> 29:15.486
So, what you do is you dice up the cheese,
you toss it in with the egg whites

29:15.587 --> 29:18.556
and you chop up some avocado,
throw it all together,

29:18.657 --> 29:21.922
whoa, Daddy,
you got yourself a wicked omelet.

29:23.562 --> 29:24.586
General.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.631
-We're just exchanging recipes.
-I heard.

29:31.336 --> 29:32.860
Has he offered up anything?

29:32.971 --> 29:35.405
No, sir, the man doesn't even have
a decent pie crust.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.668
The Ori are not going to ascend you.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.542
They lied to you and anyone else
they could take advantage of.

29:41.646 --> 29:44.638
"Let not the words of deceivers
lead you to doubt,

29:45.317 --> 29:47.911
"nor the enticements they offer
cause you to stray."

29:48.019 --> 29:49.111
Exactly.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.249
And the sad fact is
you gave it all up for nothing.

29:52.357 --> 29:55.258
The life you had is gone.
The Ori took it away from you.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.456
"Blessed are the true believers,
for only they shall walk the path.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.933
"And they shall be welcomed
unto the realm of the Ori

30:02.033 --> 30:03.193
"and made as one with them."

30:03.668 --> 30:05.533
What did you leave behind?

30:05.704 --> 30:07.001
A wife?

30:07.739 --> 30:08.899
Children?

30:12.077 --> 30:13.738
I have a grown daughter.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.577
I wasn't around much
when she was growing up.

30:17.682 --> 30:19.843
That's something I'll always regret.

30:20.552 --> 30:21.883
Do you ever think about your kids?

30:23.555 --> 30:25.523
The time you spent with them,

30:26.424 --> 30:30.155
and the things you used to do together,
before you threw it all away?

30:32.664 --> 30:37.101
But how would I know whether the Ori
are ascending people or not?

30:37.202 --> 30:39.534
Truth is, I don't know for sure.

30:40.939 --> 30:42.236
But he does.

30:45.143 --> 30:46.804
Hello, Damaris.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.136
Who are you?

30:50.549 --> 30:52.016
-How do you...
-Know?

30:52.317 --> 30:56.981
Your entire life was an open book to me
the moment you set foot in this galaxy.

30:59.124 --> 31:03.060
I was once ascended, but I took this form

31:03.161 --> 31:06.756
because it was the only way
to warn the humans about the Ori.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.662
Since I made that decision

31:08.767 --> 31:13.136
I've paid a heavy price,
in terms of the effect it's had on my mind,

31:13.738 --> 31:15.706
the memories I've lost.

31:15.807 --> 31:19.607
"Life and death, light and darkness,
hope and despair.

31:19.978 --> 31:23.812
"The rift was created, and on that day,
the Ori were born."

31:23.915 --> 31:26.975
But every so often,
something will stir in me

31:27.085 --> 31:31.146
and if I push myself hard enough,
I'll remember one more time

31:31.256 --> 31:33.486
before it leaves me forever.

31:33.592 --> 31:39.053
Your name, Damaris, your wife, Adina,
your sons, Jaden and Allon.

31:39.164 --> 31:43.157
"But the hatred of those who strayed
from the true path festered and bloomed

31:43.268 --> 31:45.930
"in the dark corners of the Avernikas
to which had been cast! "

31:46.037 --> 31:50.804
And the fact that the Ori have never
ascended any of their followers.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.106
"And consumed by this hatred,
they poisoned all they touched,

31:54.279 --> 31:56.873
"bringing death, darkness and despair."

31:56.982 --> 31:59.348
You know that as an Ancient,
I wouldn't lie to you.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.612
"And the souls of their victims
knew no peace

32:01.720 --> 32:04.245
"until the Ori came
and whispered to them,

32:04.356 --> 32:07.883
"'Sleep, for the end draws near.'"

32:09.394 --> 32:10.952
MlTCHELL: He's overcome the device.

32:11.062 --> 32:16.557
"And on that day, all will rejoice
when the Ori come and lay them low."

32:16.668 --> 32:17.635
(GUN FIRES)

32:17.736 --> 32:18.828
General.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.901
(GROANS)

32:21.773 --> 32:24.003
I'm fine. What was he saying?

32:24.109 --> 32:28.443
He just told you why the Ori
are on their way to this galaxy.

32:30.415 --> 32:33.009
They're coming to destroy the Ancients.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.765
You have made the right choice.

32:47.932 --> 32:52.301
There is no honor in fighting
an unwinnable battle.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.371
Nor peace at the hands of a tyrant.

32:56.341 --> 33:00.937
I assure you, the Ori are not the Goa'uld.

33:02.047 --> 33:06.211
Have we truly lived as slaves for so long
that we must fear being free?

33:06.317 --> 33:08.012
It has nothing to do with freedom.

33:08.119 --> 33:11.020
Enlightenment is just within our reach.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.619
Or so the Ori would have us believe.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.282
Why have you led me here?

33:39.384 --> 33:42.717
I thought it fitting that on this day,

33:42.821 --> 33:45.312
when we must sacrifice
our short-lived freedom

33:45.423 --> 33:49.689
that we do so here,
at the site of the Battle of Tazek'Sur,

33:50.095 --> 33:52.689
where your father gave his life
for this very cause.

33:56.501 --> 34:00.494
He began to doubt the Goa'uld long
before this rebellion took shape, Gerak.

34:00.605 --> 34:03.870
It was your father's death at their hands
that led you to question,

34:03.975 --> 34:07.934
"What god is so deserving
of my worship?"

34:08.046 --> 34:10.207
You were not the one who was chosen.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.542
You did not witness the wonders I beheld.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.212
Did they raise the dead?

34:18.389 --> 34:20.050
Heal the sick and wounded?

34:20.225 --> 34:23.820
Destroy their enemy
with but a wave of their hand?

34:25.663 --> 34:27.790
The Goa'uld deceived us.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.933
The Ori's powers are pure.

34:32.537 --> 34:35.631
And what is the measure of a god, Gerak?

34:36.608 --> 34:39.941
Is it the scope of their power,
or how they choose to wield that power?

34:40.545 --> 34:44.481
Would a god who is prepared to lead us
on the path of enlightenment

34:44.582 --> 34:46.675
so contradict this divine benevolence

34:46.785 --> 34:48.980
by destroying all those
who refuse to believe in him?

34:51.523 --> 34:54.856
Those who refuse to believe must die.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.796
I understand how difficult
this must be for you, Gerak.

35:04.669 --> 35:06.637
Nearing your final years,

35:06.738 --> 35:10.435
you so desperately long
for the enlightenment that we all seek.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.509
This is not the way to save yourself.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.549
I only wanted to avoid bloodshed.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.174
Stay this course

35:20.285 --> 35:23.948
and you will have no choice
but to spill the blood of your brothers.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.853
And you may start with me.

35:29.694 --> 35:34.495
For if I have a choice between resistance
or returning to the life of slavery

35:34.999 --> 35:37.399
then I choose to die free.

35:50.114 --> 35:52.207
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.809
Carolyn, can you tell these people I'm fine?

35:55.920 --> 35:57.251
You're not fine.

35:57.722 --> 35:59.849
Your blood work came back positive.

36:00.124 --> 36:01.557
You have the virus.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.362
It's always darkest before the dawn.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.764
My uncle used to say that all the time.
He was a wedding planner.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.206
-General Hammond.
-At ease.

36:18.443 --> 36:21.503
-Sir, when did you arrive?
-Oh, I've been here a while, Colonel,

36:21.613 --> 36:25.174
but you were busy and I thought
it was best not to disturb you.

36:25.950 --> 36:29.113
Colonel Mitchell, congratulations
on getting the band back together.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.983
Thank you, sir. It wasn't easy.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.156
No, but worth it.

36:33.358 --> 36:36.623
You couldn't ask for three better people
watching your back.

36:37.262 --> 36:40.254
I'm sorry I won't get a chance
to see Teal'c before I go.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.595
-You're leaving, sir?
-I'm off to Peterson.

36:42.700 --> 36:47.228
-I've been called back to Washington.
-Well, it's good to see you again, sir.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.407
It's good to see you, too. All of you.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.705
Give my best to Teal'c.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.807
Take care of each other.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.971
Take care of General Landry, too.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.392
LAM: You're awake.

37:12.597 --> 37:14.394
How you feeling?

37:16.467 --> 37:19.436
After that Iittle nap,
better than I've felt all day.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.494
How's that for irony?

37:22.974 --> 37:24.999
How are Mitchell and Dr. Jackson?

37:25.710 --> 37:28.178
-They're clean.
-And Orlin?

37:29.948 --> 37:32.109
I just ran a battery of tests on him.

37:32.216 --> 37:36.118
I'm afraid the effort of drawing out
all those memories has taken a toll,

37:36.220 --> 37:39.485
accelerated the degenerative process,
so he's in his quarters resting.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.787
You look tired, Carolyn.
You should get some sleep.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.759
I can 't. Not yet.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.489
I can make that an order.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.933
Last time you ordered me to bed,
I think I was 6.

37:50.034 --> 37:52.127
You were just as stubborn back then.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.533
I spoke to Mom recently.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.301
-How is she?
-Worried.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.474
AII those years I was growing up
I resented the fact

38:00.578 --> 38:03.809
that you never told us anything
about your work,

38:04.115 --> 38:08.415
about why you had to Iea ve us for days,
sometimes weeks at a time.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.814
But now,

38:15.093 --> 38:19.154
I'm beginning to understand
how hard it must ha ve been for you.

38:23.368 --> 38:27.168
Talking to Mom the other day
I wanted to reassure her,

38:27.372 --> 38:29.840
to tell her everything, but I couldn 't.

38:30.274 --> 38:31.673
It was hard.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.476
MAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
Unscheduled offworld activation.

38:37.715 --> 38:38.875
(SIREN BLARING)

38:47.058 --> 38:48.548
It's Teal'c.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.200
Lower your weapons.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.537
This is Colonel Carter. Stand down.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.963
What's going on?

39:32.070 --> 39:34.561
Gerak has arrived to assist us.

39:42.346 --> 39:44.337
Why do you hesitate, Gerak?

39:45.416 --> 39:48.249
If I help you, I will die.

39:49.854 --> 39:52.755
But I will die free.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.028
Gerak!

40:17.448 --> 40:19.211
What the hell just happened?

40:19.383 --> 40:22.045
I thought the Ori
weren't able to take action in this galaxy

40:22.153 --> 40:24.781
-without inciting the Ancients.
-They can't.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.948
It must've been some sort
of physiological failsafe

40:27.058 --> 40:28.685
they put in place
when they made him a Prior,

40:28.793 --> 40:30.784
in the event he ever turned.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.620
They're normalizing. It worked.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.270
WOMAN ON T.V. : The final death toll of
the pandemic has been estimated at

40:48.379 --> 40:50.870
a Iittle over 3,000 worldwide.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.782
But health officials are quick to point out
that it could ha ve been much worse.

40:54.886 --> 40:57.480
As distribution of the vaccine continues,

40:57.588 --> 41:01.149
many ha ve begun to ask how
this could've happened in the first place,

41:01.259 --> 41:04.786
and more to the point,
where did this virus originate?

41:04.896 --> 41:06.363
We were lucky.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.995
There might not be someone like Gerak
to help us next time.

41:10.334 --> 41:13.098
It wasn't just Gerak.
He cured the people in the base.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.536
From them,
we were able to isolate an antibody

41:15.640 --> 41:18.837
and manufacture a vaccine
using Orlin's formula.

41:18.943 --> 41:21.537
Thanks to Orlin's work,
we should be able to prevent

41:21.646 --> 41:23.477
the Priors from attacking us
this way again.

41:23.581 --> 41:25.947
Oh, I reckon they got
a pretty wide repertoire.

41:26.050 --> 41:30.009
The Ori will undoubtedly view this defeat
as nothing more than a minor setback.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.679
It will not be enough to dissuade them

41:31.789 --> 41:33.916
from continuing their incursion
into this galaxy.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.892
Certainly not if their end game
is to destroy the Ancients.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.757
Given the fact
that they're personally threatened,

41:38.863 --> 41:41.661
do you think the Ancients will
take measures to defend themselves?

41:41.766 --> 41:42.926
If it comes to that, it's possible,

41:43.034 --> 41:46.197
but I think we're a long way from the Ori
posing the Ancients a serious threat.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.568
No, they're just a threat
to everyone else in the galaxy.

41:50.474 --> 41:51.702
So how's Orlin?

41:52.877 --> 41:57.211
His condition has stabilized, but I'm afraid
the damage has already been done.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.193
-Hello.
-Hi.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.633
Who are you?

42:19.804 --> 42:21.294
My name is Samantha.

42:23.874 --> 42:27.241
-Do you need help with this?
-Sure.

42:30.915 --> 42:34.749
I finished the outside,
so you can help me with the inside.

42:34.852 --> 42:36.012
Okay.
