01:11.488 --> 01:14.135
<i>Praise to the Lord</i>

01:14.215 --> 01:20.713
<i>Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth</i>

01:21.640 --> 01:25.606
<i>Shelters he under his wings</i>

01:25.686 --> 01:30.881
<i>Yet so gently sustaineth</i>

01:31.920 --> 01:34.573
<i>Hast thou not seen</i>

01:34.653 --> 01:40.579
<i>How thy desires ever have been</i>

01:40.659 --> 01:47.657
<i>Granted in what he ordaineth</i>

02:07.769 --> 02:09.691
Are you cold?

02:09.770 --> 02:10.761
No.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.572
Are you nervous?

02:15.652 --> 02:16.642
No.

02:41.502 --> 02:43.558
Are you comfortable?

02:43.638 --> 02:46.355
Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you.

02:46.641 --> 02:48.522
- You're not cold?
- No.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.840
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.

02:56.651 --> 02:58.657
You'll find that there can be a draught.

02:58.737 --> 03:00.774
Won't be like what you're used to.

03:03.658 --> 03:06.296
You ought to keep to the house.

03:07.662 --> 03:09.743
But I don't mind the fresh air.

03:10.582 --> 03:12.796
You'll be more comfortable in the house.

03:12.876 --> 03:14.506
I like the fresh air.

03:14.586 --> 03:17.703
- I like being outside...
- Take it off.

03:20.675 --> 03:22.587
Your nightdress, take it off.

07:32.761 --> 07:34.683
So you'll not go to London, then?

07:34.763 --> 07:36.518
What?

07:36.598 --> 07:41.806
My son will stay here with his wife
and play master or something.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.645
Excuse me.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.686
Good night.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.738
You're very tired lately, Katherine.

08:08.713 --> 08:11.626
You will wait up for your husband.

08:12.717 --> 08:14.639
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.

08:14.719 --> 08:16.676
You will wait up, Katherine.

08:19.682 --> 08:20.763
I will try, sir.

08:24.646 --> 08:28.606
Sit with Mrs. Lester,
see that she doesn't fall asleep.

08:41.746 --> 08:43.578
I'm awake.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.574
Stop staring, Anna.

08:48.586 --> 08:50.675
- But Mr. Lester said...
- I know what Mr. Lester said

08:50.755 --> 08:53.589
but I'm awake so there's
no need to stare at me.

09:13.653 --> 09:14.643
Stand up.

09:17.615 --> 09:18.605
Stand!

09:22.787 --> 09:23.777
Leave.

09:40.638 --> 09:42.595
Stop smiling.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.640
Take your nightdress off.

10:08.625 --> 10:09.741
Face the wall.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.639
Face the wall!

11:16.567 --> 11:17.655
'Where has my husband gone?'

11:17.735 --> 11:18.740
Away.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.700
- Away?
- That's what I said.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.745
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.

11:23.825 --> 11:25.691
But I do concern myself.

11:29.664 --> 11:33.504
There's been an explosion,
at the colliery at Amble.

11:33.584 --> 11:34.589
An explosion?

11:34.669 --> 11:38.709
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine. An explosion.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.642
I leave for London this morning.

11:45.722 --> 11:47.679
You'll be on your own for a while.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.522
Perhaps you will find
that your energy is restored

11:51.602 --> 11:55.526
after a little of your own company,
and when your husband returns

11:55.606 --> 12:00.650
you can resume your duties
with more rigour, madam.

15:39.747 --> 15:42.706
- Just taking a break, ma'am.
- On my husband's time?

15:44.752 --> 15:46.789
We'll get straight back to it.

15:52.677 --> 15:55.545
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.

15:56.764 --> 15:59.598
Weighing a sow, to be precise.

16:01.769 --> 16:02.759
A sow?

16:04.647 --> 16:06.706
As you see.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.567
Take her down.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.606
I said, take her down!

16:19.620 --> 16:20.701
Face the wall.

16:22.623 --> 16:24.535
And stop smiling.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.615
May we turn around yet, ma'am?

17:06.584 --> 17:08.645
How much would I weigh?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.632
Would you like me to check?

17:20.598 --> 17:21.588
Guess.

17:50.586 --> 17:54.626
You have wasted quite enough of
my husband's good time and money.

17:57.593 --> 17:59.676
I shall be keeping an eye on you gentlemen.

18:08.604 --> 18:09.692
Anna?

18:09.772 --> 18:12.685
- Ma'am, if I can explain...
- What was his name?

18:15.653 --> 18:17.770
The one that called you a pig,
what was his name?

18:20.783 --> 18:22.775
- Sebastian, ma'am.
- Is he new?

18:24.662 --> 18:26.619
Yes, ma'am. He's the new groomsman.

18:34.630 --> 18:36.677
Is there something else, Anna?

18:36.757 --> 18:38.589
No, ma'am.

19:41.155 --> 19:43.021
My boots, Anna.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.984
- It's still cold out there.
- It's warm enough.

19:48.954 --> 19:51.037
- Mr. Lester said that you weren't to...
- Yes?

19:53.042 --> 19:55.125
- It's going to rain today, ma'am.
- Good.

20:04.011 --> 20:05.001
Are you lost?

20:09.016 --> 20:10.973
House is in the other direction.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.015
Mrs. Lester!

20:33.123 --> 20:36.005
- Anna, it's too hot.
- Your skin's too cold.

20:36.085 --> 20:37.047
Ow!

20:37.127 --> 20:40.120
It only feels too hot because
the cold's got into your bones.

20:40.923 --> 20:42.960
If it feels too hot, then it is too hot.

20:46.095 --> 20:47.927
Anna, you're hurting me.

20:48.973 --> 20:49.963
Anna!

20:50.182 --> 20:53.063
Anna, stop it! What's wrong with you?

20:53.143 --> 20:56.025
- Sorry, I...
- You've made my skin all red.

20:56.105 --> 20:59.143
- You'll catch a fever, ma'am.
- It's just a bit of fresh air, Anna.

21:01.110 --> 21:04.950
And there's no need for you
to stare at me currently, is there?

21:05.030 --> 21:06.111
It's unnerving.

21:50.993 --> 21:53.076
I'm terribly bored, Mrs. Lester.

21:55.998 --> 21:58.115
You should dedicate more time to your work.

22:08.135 --> 22:11.892
- Aren't you bored, Katherine?
- You can't call me that.

22:11.972 --> 22:13.133
Get out. Get out!

22:18.145 --> 22:20.137
What do you want?

22:28.155 --> 22:29.910
No! No!

22:29.990 --> 22:31.151
Shh, shh.

26:10.377 --> 26:14.051
You must be anticipating the return
of your father-in-law, Mrs. Lester.

26:14.131 --> 26:16.887
- And your husband.
- I must.

26:16.967 --> 26:19.129
It is not good to be
without company for too long.

26:21.138 --> 26:23.926
- The decline in your health...
- My health?

26:24.099 --> 26:26.136
Your absence from church, madam.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.066
No doubt brought on by their absence.

26:29.146 --> 26:30.933
No doubt.

26:31.064 --> 26:34.905
Perhaps a little more time
spent indoors, Mrs. Lester.

26:34.985 --> 26:36.977
I understand you've been taking the air.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.148
Perhaps a little more solitude
and reflection will do.

26:49.082 --> 26:50.072
Thank you.

26:51.084 --> 26:52.950
Thank you so much.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.924
It's early for you, Anna.

27:45.973 --> 27:48.010
I said, it's early for you, Anna.

27:50.060 --> 27:51.899
And for you, sir.

27:51.979 --> 27:53.901
Ah, she speaks!

27:53.981 --> 27:55.973
Not so. Got to give dogs a run-around.

27:56.984 --> 27:59.146
A bitch gets restless
if she's tied up too long.

28:02.030 --> 28:03.111
She was, sir.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.106
Was what?

28:06.034 --> 28:07.150
Tied up too long.

28:12.958 --> 28:16.122
Mr. Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew
what was happening in his absence.

28:17.004 --> 28:19.997
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?

28:25.178 --> 28:27.135
The dogs, sir.

28:30.142 --> 28:33.135
Thank you, Anna. I'll look into that.

28:34.521 --> 28:37.138
It's good of you to keep
such a close eye on things.

29:41.004 --> 29:42.996
Mr. Lester has returned.

29:44.966 --> 29:46.173
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.

29:47.928 --> 29:49.891
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.

29:49.971 --> 29:51.963
He said not to expect him till dinner.

30:42.983 --> 30:44.019
Katherine.

30:45.026 --> 30:46.983
Welcome home, sir.

31:10.010 --> 31:12.923
- Have you kept well?
- I have. Thank you, sir.

31:16.099 --> 31:18.939
You haven't been running
the house in my absence.

31:19.019 --> 31:20.065
I have.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.137
That wasn't a question.

31:24.107 --> 31:27.330
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.

31:31.031 --> 31:32.112
I'm so sorry.

31:34.117 --> 31:37.030
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.

31:40.123 --> 31:42.115
Get a bottle of the Fleurie.

31:56.056 --> 31:58.173
- He wants a Fleurie.
- There's none of that left.

31:58.975 --> 32:00.939
- None of it?
- Not a drop.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.976
She's drank it all.

32:24.125 --> 32:28.119
Excuse me, sir,
but there's none of the Fleurie left.

32:28.922 --> 32:30.129
That's impossible. Look again.

32:33.927 --> 32:37.921
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.

32:38.098 --> 32:41.011
And how exactly has it all gone?

32:45.105 --> 32:47.027
I don't know, sir.

32:47.107 --> 32:49.144
- You don't know?
- No, sir.

32:51.027 --> 32:53.144
And the cook, does she not know?

32:55.156 --> 32:56.192
No, sir.

32:58.159 --> 33:00.196
Do you not think it necessary

33:00.996 --> 33:04.920
to keep an account of what happens
to my property in this household?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.117
All my property.

33:08.044 --> 33:11.092
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.

33:11.172 --> 33:14.012
And yet you can offer no other explanation.

33:14.092 --> 33:15.082
No, sir.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.044
Get down.

33:21.141 --> 33:24.009
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.

33:39.993 --> 33:44.112
You behave like an animal,
and I'll treat you like an animal.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.119
Now, get out.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.967
Lock him up.

35:19.568 --> 35:21.014
Sebastian?

35:27.934 --> 35:32.140
I have no desire to see you, until I've
had time to consider what to do with you.

35:32.939 --> 35:33.943
Let him out.

35:34.023 --> 35:37.187
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.

35:37.986 --> 35:39.991
Nothing to be ashamed of?

35:40.071 --> 35:42.035
Do you have any idea

35:42.115 --> 35:45.997
of the damage that you're capable
of bringing upon this family?

35:46.077 --> 35:50.877
You have failed miserably
in all of your marital duties,

35:50.957 --> 35:55.048
more specifically, to provide
your husband with a legitimate heir.

35:55.128 --> 35:58.051
Where is your son? Where is he?

35:58.131 --> 36:01.090
He has made that impossible. Let him out.

36:44.344 --> 36:47.257
You've had enough time
to contemplate, I hope,

36:47.388 --> 36:49.352
and to take the opportunity to meditate

36:49.432 --> 36:53.398
upon your duties as a wife,
Katherine, in this household

36:53.478 --> 36:55.435
above anything else.

36:55.605 --> 36:57.562
Give me the key or let him out.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.524
Leave it!

37:11.496 --> 37:13.533
I cannot bear to look at you.

37:48.449 --> 37:49.485
Sit.

37:51.578 --> 37:52.568
Sit.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.395
Eat.

38:14.475 --> 38:16.558
- I'm not...
- Eat with me. I hate to eat alone.

38:22.567 --> 38:25.406
Tell me about your family, Anna.

38:25.486 --> 38:26.567
Tell me about your home.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.411
I haven't been home in a very long time.

38:30.491 --> 38:32.574
I'm not sure I know what home is.

38:33.369 --> 38:35.577
Do you have any brothers? Anna?

38:36.372 --> 38:37.488
Do you have any brothers?

38:38.499 --> 38:40.296
How many sisters do you have?

38:40.376 --> 38:41.422
He's... We should...

38:41.502 --> 38:43.585
What are the names of your sisters?

38:44.380 --> 38:45.426
Sit back down, Anna.

38:45.506 --> 38:47.828
- No, he needs...
- Sit down!

39:32.428 --> 39:34.590
Run to the village for a doctor. Quick, go.

41:15.406 --> 41:18.490
'He'll not return for the funeral.
He said as much.'

41:20.453 --> 41:22.375
We won't have long.

41:22.455 --> 41:24.367
He won't come back.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.533
He hated his father. He hates me.

41:29.378 --> 41:30.585
Perhaps he just won't come back.

42:20.555 --> 42:21.545
There.

42:22.515 --> 42:24.427
Very fine indeed.

42:25.393 --> 42:27.430
Man of the house.

42:49.458 --> 42:51.297
Anna?

42:51.377 --> 42:52.413
Anna!

42:54.589 --> 42:57.457
Anna, when you are spoken to,
you are to respond.

43:01.512 --> 43:05.436
I'm going to ask one of the maids,
um... that young girl,

43:05.516 --> 43:08.554
to prepare and bring me breakfast
and all my meals from now on.

43:10.396 --> 43:11.512
Just as a precaution.

43:21.449 --> 43:23.371
It could be the mushrooms or his heart.

43:23.451 --> 43:27.291
Nobody's blaming you
so don't be so hard on yourself.

43:27.371 --> 43:28.459
You're careful.

43:28.539 --> 43:33.409
He was old and he had a weak stomach.
You heard what Dr. Burdon said.

43:35.421 --> 43:38.505
The master will be home before long
and this will all be done with.

43:39.550 --> 43:42.509
Anna, I wish that you would speak again.

43:44.472 --> 43:45.553
Promise you'll try.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.557
She won't speak. She's mute.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.561
- What if it comes back?
- It won't.

44:08.579 --> 44:10.418
Do you love me?

44:10.498 --> 44:11.534
Of course.

44:12.333 --> 44:13.337
Do you adore me?

44:13.417 --> 44:14.533
Of course.

44:15.336 --> 44:16.543
Could you do without me?

44:19.548 --> 44:21.505
Could you do without me?

44:24.387 --> 44:26.470
It's husbands and wives that kiss like that.

44:30.393 --> 44:32.385
Did you husband kiss you, Katherine?

44:39.568 --> 44:41.434
She won't speak.

44:46.575 --> 44:49.534
You know I shan't be parted
from you alive, Sebastian?

44:50.538 --> 44:53.406
"Through hell and high water
I will follow you,

44:55.376 --> 44:59.416
"to the cross, to the prison,
to the grave, to the sky."

45:05.553 --> 45:08.546
I'd rather stop you breathing
than have you doubt how I feel.

45:51.390 --> 45:52.478
Sebastian.

45:52.558 --> 45:54.424
He's come home.

45:55.394 --> 45:57.556
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.

45:59.565 --> 46:01.397
What shall we do?

46:03.402 --> 46:04.609
Sebastian?

46:05.404 --> 46:07.396
Can you just shut up?

46:10.409 --> 46:13.416
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.

46:13.496 --> 46:15.408
Let me think.

46:19.418 --> 46:21.501
- Go out there.
- Go out there?

46:22.546 --> 46:25.539
Why? Am I to pretend to be
your lady-in-fucking-waiting?

46:26.342 --> 46:27.549
Just go out there.

46:58.332 --> 46:59.413
You're home.

47:02.461 --> 47:03.542
You're awake.

47:04.338 --> 47:05.454
I heard the horse.

47:07.341 --> 47:09.458
I walked it down the lane.

47:10.469 --> 47:12.426
I'm surprised you heard.

47:12.555 --> 47:15.548
I've been sleeping lightly,
ever since your father died.

47:17.393 --> 47:19.430
We had to have his funeral in your absence.

47:19.562 --> 47:22.396
Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?

47:24.400 --> 47:27.518
I shall place my feet
on his grave in the morning.

47:30.531 --> 47:33.371
Do you have the bed
made up for two every night?

47:33.451 --> 47:37.416
Ever since your letter came
I had no indication of when you'd return.

47:37.496 --> 47:39.533
And thank goodness I did. You must be tired.

47:40.499 --> 47:41.489
No.

47:47.506 --> 47:49.543
I found it in the fields.

47:50.342 --> 47:51.549
And decided to keep it?

47:52.553 --> 47:56.593
- Holds my skirts up.
- Are you skirts in danger of falling down?

47:59.393 --> 48:00.429
No, sir.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.438
You've grown fatter.

48:06.567 --> 48:10.408
The cook has made an effort
to find food to my taste perhaps.

48:10.488 --> 48:12.445
Your face is fatter.

48:13.532 --> 48:16.445
You're altogether larger than when I left.

48:20.372 --> 48:21.579
Perhaps you'd like some tea.

49:46.458 --> 49:47.494
So...

49:49.503 --> 49:53.497
you have become a whore
in my absence, Katherine.

49:58.345 --> 50:01.383
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.

50:02.433 --> 50:05.551
But perhaps you had no idea
that your whoring had been noticed.

50:09.565 --> 50:11.431
You seem surprised.

50:13.402 --> 50:18.452
And surprised that the news
of you opening your legs and your cunt

50:18.532 --> 50:22.373
for any worthless dog
should have reached my ears,

50:22.453 --> 50:26.493
but then you opened your legs
so very wide, Katherine.

50:29.376 --> 50:33.342
And you've acted so very shamelessly
and so very stupidly.

50:33.422 --> 50:36.335
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.

50:38.385 --> 50:41.475
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling,

50:41.555 --> 50:45.469
it was inevitable that the whole county
would hear of your behaviour.

50:50.522 --> 50:51.603
My father...

50:53.442 --> 50:54.558
bought you,

50:56.362 --> 51:00.402
along with a piece of land
not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.

51:03.494 --> 51:07.454
I do not like being talked about, madam.

51:12.378 --> 51:14.540
I do not like being laughed at.

51:15.339 --> 51:17.422
I do not like owning a whore.

51:20.552 --> 51:24.387
You will alter your behaviour, madam.

51:27.393 --> 51:29.481
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?

51:29.561 --> 51:32.443
You will never see that man again.

51:32.523 --> 51:35.362
He will be sent from this house

51:35.442 --> 51:40.403
and you will remain here,
indoors with your prayer book.

55:37.392 --> 55:38.553
I can't sleep.

55:39.561 --> 55:40.551
Try.

55:42.439 --> 55:43.402
I've tried.

55:43.482 --> 55:45.404
Can you sleep?

55:45.484 --> 55:47.521
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.

55:55.577 --> 55:58.490
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.

56:00.499 --> 56:02.536
Can you just get off me?

56:11.385 --> 56:13.547
How can you, just like it was before?

56:16.556 --> 56:18.468
It's making me sick.

56:19.559 --> 56:22.524
I feel sick, constantly.

56:22.604 --> 56:25.527
It won't end unless you let it.

56:25.607 --> 56:26.597
Have you let it?

56:28.360 --> 56:31.481
For you, and for me.

56:33.407 --> 56:35.537
Sebastian, he was going to kill you.

56:35.617 --> 56:37.529
He was weak.

56:39.413 --> 56:43.337
We did it so that we could be together here.

56:43.417 --> 56:45.534
No more bowing and not being
who you deserve to be.

56:52.467 --> 56:55.380
- You did it for us?
- We did it.

58:44.287 --> 58:48.327
- I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.

58:49.334 --> 58:51.417
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.

58:52.420 --> 58:55.302
- I'm sorry. You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.

58:55.382 --> 58:58.346
- I understand.
- My husband had no ward.

58:58.426 --> 59:02.466
Mr. Lester knew my daughter very well
some time ago and was fond of her.

59:03.390 --> 59:05.347
He fathered a child by her.

59:06.309 --> 59:08.356
- I beg your pardon?
- After my daughter's death...

59:08.436 --> 59:11.395
he did the honourable thing
and made Teddy his ward.

59:13.316 --> 59:16.239
He has been with us lately.
At Amble, near the colliery.

59:16.319 --> 59:17.480
I'm afraid this is impossible.

59:17.946 --> 59:22.316
He was careful to draw up papers.
I'm sorry for the shock.

59:22.409 --> 59:26.369
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.

59:27.372 --> 59:29.377
Given Mr. Lester's recent demise...

59:29.457 --> 59:32.291
My husband is not deceased.

59:33.295 --> 59:35.342
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.

59:35.422 --> 59:36.426
But presumed dead.

59:36.506 --> 59:39.544
He is missing and apparently
you saw him so soon.

59:40.343 --> 59:41.431
We did.

59:41.511 --> 59:44.392
Perhaps you can advise me
as to what has become of him.

59:44.472 --> 59:48.386
He seemed very well.
And certain he was to come here next.

59:49.394 --> 59:51.399
He said it was a matter of urgency.

59:51.479 --> 59:53.516
We can't imagine what has happened to him.

59:54.524 --> 59:56.390
I'm terribly anxious.

59:57.402 --> 59:59.282
I'm sure.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.354
There are papers, Mrs. Lester.

01:00:02.324 --> 01:00:03.531
I am sorry.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.453
Perhaps we might have tea.

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:27.310
What is it?

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:30.383
He says you're the prettiest lady
he has ever seen.

01:01:05.637 --> 01:01:07.601
- She's lying.
- She has papers.

01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:11.675
She's forged them, then. You don't think
that every man and woman in the county

01:01:12.477 --> 01:01:16.484
with half a brain and an empty pocket
isn't coming up with a similar scheme?

01:01:16.564 --> 01:01:20.614
- She has legitimate papers.
- I thought you said he couldn't fuck you.

01:01:20.694 --> 01:01:22.560
He couldn't.

01:01:23.697 --> 01:01:25.563
Or wouldn't.

01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:35.395
Katherine?

01:01:35.475 --> 01:01:36.465
What?

01:01:38.436 --> 01:01:40.072
Sorry, er...

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.012
I wasn't...

01:01:44.718 --> 01:01:47.515
- You were saying?
- I was saying it might be best

01:01:47.595 --> 01:01:49.476
if Teddy took your room.

01:01:49.556 --> 01:01:51.561
Then he's next to my room, and it's larger.

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.605
You don't need all that space.

01:01:53.685 --> 01:01:55.517
- No.
- No?

01:01:57.689 --> 01:01:59.555
No, no, I...

01:02:01.026 --> 01:02:03.190
No, I don't need all that space.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.527
After Christmas, then.

01:02:07.699 --> 01:02:09.537
Yes.

01:02:09.617 --> 01:02:11.574
And perhaps I'll take your room.

01:02:11.703 --> 01:02:16.448
You'll be used to smaller spaces
from your days in your tiny house, Agnes.

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:07.465
Katherine! Can I come?

01:03:23.608 --> 01:03:25.565
What are those ones?

01:03:27.654 --> 01:03:29.492
Swallows.

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:31.494
Look, watch them glide.

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:33.691
Aren't they beautiful?

01:03:34.035 --> 01:03:36.448
I think you're beautiful.

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:44.266
- How do you know that?
- What?

01:03:44.346 --> 01:03:46.503
Names of birds.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.597
My mother taught me.

01:03:50.677 --> 01:03:55.513
She'd take us on long walks and teach us
the names of birds and trees.

01:03:56.558 --> 01:04:00.518
- Outside things?
- Yes.

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.641
Do you miss your mother?

01:04:08.653 --> 01:04:09.689
Yes.

01:04:11.573 --> 01:04:12.734
Do you?

01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:14.569
Yes.

01:04:46.691 --> 01:04:49.650
You don't mind if I... if I join you, do you?

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.659
I just want to walk a little with you, Anna.

01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:03.461
I won't scare you.

01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:04.657
Promise.

01:06:12.527 --> 01:06:13.563
Get off me.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:19.621
I need to talk to you.

01:06:19.701 --> 01:06:22.569
Go back to your house and your little master.

01:06:23.621 --> 01:06:25.502
Please come inside. I can't...

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:27.699
If I come inside, then we're found out.

01:06:28.501 --> 01:06:30.548
And if we're found out, then I'll hang.

01:06:30.628 --> 01:06:33.666
While that boy's here, I'm out here.
That's the end of it.

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:36.582
Get out!

01:07:25.516 --> 01:07:26.604
Sebastian!

01:07:26.684 --> 01:07:28.550
Katherine, watch me.

01:07:29.604 --> 01:07:31.442
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.

01:07:31.522 --> 01:07:34.481
- Please, please!
- Get off! Leave me alone!

01:07:37.128 --> 01:07:38.609
Sebastian!

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:43.524
Sebastian.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.539
Sebastian?

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.467
Sebastian?

01:07:56.547 --> 01:07:57.663
Ma'am.

01:07:58.633 --> 01:08:01.431
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.548
We can't find him anywhere.

01:08:11.562 --> 01:08:13.554
- Teddy?
- Teddy?

01:08:16.567 --> 01:08:17.557
Teddy?

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.519
Teddy?

01:08:23.573 --> 01:08:25.496
- Teddy?
- Teddy?

01:08:25.576 --> 01:08:26.566
Teddy?

01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:34.491
Teddy?

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:13.636
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall. He's freezing.

01:10:15.603 --> 01:10:18.526
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?

01:10:18.606 --> 01:10:22.447
How dare you walk into this house
and give orders? Get out.

01:10:22.527 --> 01:10:24.610
- I saved him.
- Get out!

01:10:29.575 --> 01:10:30.656
Teddy, Teddy.

01:10:34.622 --> 01:10:38.463
I will not stay here and be humiliated
for the sake of that boy.

01:10:38.543 --> 01:10:39.630
- Sebastian...
- I will not!

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:42.425
Tell me what to do. I will do anything.

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:45.543
- It's too late.
- What? What do you mean?

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.556
I stood in front of him, Katherine.

01:10:48.636 --> 01:10:51.517
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.

01:10:51.597 --> 01:10:53.463
One step behind him.

01:10:55.443 --> 01:10:56.633
And I...

01:10:58.972 --> 01:11:01.044
It's too late.

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:05.564
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.

01:11:45.785 --> 01:11:47.615
You should go to bed.

01:11:47.695 --> 01:11:48.685
I can't.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.520
One of us should get some sleep.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.612
I wouldn't sleep.

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:58.584
Lie down for a while. I'll sit up with him.

01:11:58.664 --> 01:12:01.623
You need some rest and he'll need you
when he wakes up.

01:12:07.548 --> 01:12:09.665
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.

01:12:24.523 --> 01:12:25.513
Thank you.

01:14:01.495 --> 01:14:03.578
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy. Sleep.

01:14:08.085 --> 01:14:09.840
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.290
- Let me go. Katherine.
- Shh.

01:15:31.002 --> 01:15:32.583
It is done.

01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:37.251
Sebastian.

01:15:39.677 --> 01:15:41.432
No, no, no.

01:15:41.512 --> 01:15:42.628
Go wait until I come.

01:15:43.681 --> 01:15:45.468
Go.

01:18:23.215 --> 01:18:27.097
I must've fallen asleep
for ten minutes, perhaps.

01:18:27.177 --> 01:18:29.169
When I woke, he wasn't breathing.

01:18:32.224 --> 01:18:37.149
Can you remember
what time that was, Mrs. Lester?

01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:41.028
Just before the girl came in.
Er... I couldn't say exactly.

01:18:41.108 --> 01:18:42.269
Five, perhaps.

01:18:43.068 --> 01:18:46.033
- I was upset.
- Of course.

01:18:49.074 --> 01:18:50.155
I wonder...

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.241
What?

01:18:54.038 --> 01:18:57.122
Could you have been asleep
longer than you thought?

01:18:58.042 --> 01:19:01.160
Might someone have taken
the opportunity to come in?

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:09.009
- There were bruises...
- From the waterfall.

01:19:11.055 --> 01:19:12.171
They weren't there before.

01:19:16.226 --> 01:19:19.191
- When I woke, the boy was dead.
- Katherine...

01:19:19.271 --> 01:19:22.230
He must've got the bruises
from the waterfall.

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:26.063
- Dr. Burdon says not.
- Can Dr. Burdon swear to it?

01:19:29.073 --> 01:19:32.111
- Have we not suffered enough?
- Mrs. Lester...

01:19:34.119 --> 01:19:35.155
Forgive me.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:39.277
Mrs. Lester, you do realise...

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:48.047
We killed the boy.

01:19:50.094 --> 01:19:53.017
I beg your pardon, sir. Who are you?

01:19:53.097 --> 01:19:55.185
She killed him.

01:19:55.265 --> 01:19:59.134
She held a pillow over his face
and I held his legs.

01:20:01.105 --> 01:20:03.110
She killed Alexander Lester.

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:08.060
She killed Boris Lester, poisoned him
with mushrooms and let him die.

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:13.114
She... killed that boy.

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:20.169
She killed that boy
so that we could be together.

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:23.117
And I thought I loved her.

01:20:27.172 --> 01:20:29.209
She suffocated me.

01:20:31.009 --> 01:20:34.099
She suffocated me and she hounded me.

01:20:34.179 --> 01:20:37.138
And then she never let me be.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.012
She's a disease.

01:20:48.068 --> 01:20:49.184
Mrs. Lester?

01:20:56.201 --> 01:20:58.033
He's lying.

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:05.037
Anna...

01:21:06.086 --> 01:21:07.167
He and Anna did it.

01:21:08.088 --> 01:21:10.135
- For whatever reason of their own.
- You bitch!

01:21:10.215 --> 01:21:13.013
Everyone knows that she picks the mushrooms

01:21:13.093 --> 01:21:15.210
and he follows her
to the woods every morning.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:20.145
Perhaps they were found out
and threatened with separation.

01:21:20.725 --> 01:21:24.024
My father-in-law beat him
within an inch of his life

01:21:24.104 --> 01:21:26.096
the day before he died.

01:21:30.068 --> 01:21:31.104
And that boy...

01:21:33.631 --> 01:21:36.068
That boy was like a child to me.

01:21:46.126 --> 01:21:48.132
Anna will say if otherwise.

01:21:48.212 --> 01:21:51.080
I did nothing.
