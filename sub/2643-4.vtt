WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:04.027
I'm telling you, if xenon emits
ultraviolet light,

00:04.029 --> 00:06.430
then those dark matter
discoveries must be wrong.

00:06.431 --> 00:08.432
Yes, well, if we lived
in a world

00:08.433 --> 00:10.468
where slow-moving xenon
produced light,

00:10.469 --> 00:11.702
then you'd be correct.

00:11.703 --> 00:13.237
Also, pigs would fly,

00:13.238 --> 00:15.072
my derriere would produce
cotton candy,

00:15.073 --> 00:18.676
and <i>The Phantom Menace</i>
would be a timeless classic.

00:18.677 --> 00:19.877
Oh, you're so arrogant.

00:19.878 --> 00:21.178
If you were a superhero,

00:21.179 --> 00:22.947
your name would be
Captain Arrogant.

00:22.948 --> 00:25.116
And you know
what your superpower would be?

00:25.117 --> 00:26.617
Arrogance.

00:26.618 --> 00:28.886
You're wrong again.

00:28.887 --> 00:34.725
If my superpower were arrogance,
my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

00:34.726 --> 00:37.862
I love watching Raj and Sheldon
try to work together.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.864
Yeah, it's like
if Alien and Predator decided

00:39.865 --> 00:43.300
to go partners
in a Jamba Juice.

00:43.301 --> 00:45.169
Has it occurred to you
you're missing the big picture?

00:45.170 --> 00:47.271
If you look at neutron
scattering data...
Oh, Penny?

00:47.272 --> 00:48.339
Penny?
What's up?

00:48.340 --> 00:50.141
Nothing. I just wanted

00:50.142 --> 00:52.409
to make Raj stop talking.

00:52.410 --> 00:54.311
No, no, no.

00:54.312 --> 00:55.980
He won. Suck it up.

00:55.981 --> 00:58.415
Well, I'd ask you guys
if you want dessert,

00:58.416 --> 01:00.618
but I know Sheldon doesn't
eat dessert on Tuesdays.

01:00.619 --> 01:03.087
And even if Raj wanted
something, he couldn't tell me.

01:03.088 --> 01:04.321
Howard won't order anything,

01:04.322 --> 01:06.490
but he will come up
with some sort of skeevy comment

01:06.491 --> 01:08.125
involving the words pie
or cheesecake.

01:08.126 --> 01:10.327
And Leonard's
lactose intolerant,

01:10.328 --> 01:11.729
so he can't eat anything here

01:11.730 --> 01:13.264
without his intestines
blowing up

01:13.265 --> 01:14.498
like a balloon animal.

01:14.499 --> 01:17.268
Hang on a second.

01:17.269 --> 01:18.836
I could have the fruit platter.

01:18.837 --> 01:19.804
You want the fruit platter?

01:19.805 --> 01:21.338
Does it have melon
on it?
Yeah.

01:21.339 --> 01:22.807
No, I can't eat melon.

01:24.075 --> 01:25.342
Oh, Howard,
heads up.

01:25.343 --> 01:28.512
Your ex-girlfriend just
came in for her shift.

01:28.513 --> 01:30.347
When was the last time
you saw her?

01:30.348 --> 01:31.949
Oh, not since we broke up.

01:31.950 --> 01:35.085
Wow. How am I going
to play this?

01:35.086 --> 01:37.154
Sophisticated and relaxed?

01:37.155 --> 01:38.556
Friendly, noncommittal?

01:38.557 --> 01:40.357
Cold and distant?

01:43.628 --> 01:45.062
Hi, guys.
Hey.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.831
Hello.

01:46.832 --> 01:51.035
I see you decided to go
with pathetic and frightened.

01:51.036 --> 01:53.637
It's one of his best moves.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.416
So, my dear, we meet again.

02:44.286 --> 02:46.120
Hello, Howard.

02:46.121 --> 02:47.488
I've missed you.

02:47.489 --> 02:51.392
I've missed you,
Katee Sackhoff.

02:51.393 --> 02:53.694
One question.
Anything.

02:53.695 --> 02:57.198
Why am I wearing my
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
flight suit in bed?

02:57.199 --> 03:00.334
Why are <i>you</i> in bed with <i>me?</i>

03:00.335 --> 03:04.138
If we start to question this,
it all falls apart.

03:04.139 --> 03:05.306
Sorry.

03:07.275 --> 03:08.542
Oh, ravish
me, Howard.

03:08.543 --> 03:10.778
My loins
ache for you.

03:11.813 --> 03:14.014
Okay, if you insist.

03:15.350 --> 03:17.451
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, have you seen

03:17.452 --> 03:18.819
my girdle?!

03:18.820 --> 03:20.454
No, Ma!

03:20.455 --> 03:23.924
I can't find it, and I'm late
for my Weight Watchers meeting!

03:23.925 --> 03:26.060
Maybe it committed suicide!

03:26.061 --> 03:27.495
Leave me alone!

03:29.731 --> 03:31.298
Now, where were we?

03:31.299 --> 03:33.334
I believe you
were about

03:33.335 --> 03:36.136
to rip off my uniform
with your teeth.

03:36.137 --> 03:37.671
Bernadette?!

03:37.672 --> 03:39.039
What are you doing here?

03:39.040 --> 03:41.175
Well, if I had to
guess, I'd say I'm here

03:41.176 --> 03:42.776
because you saw me
earlier this evening,

03:42.777 --> 03:44.278
and you're still
hung up on me.

03:44.279 --> 03:45.513
No, I'm not.

03:45.514 --> 03:47.982
Clearly you are.

03:49.584 --> 03:51.785
Otherwise, based
on past experience,

03:51.786 --> 03:53.954
we'd be done by now.

03:54.890 --> 03:57.424
Okay,
I'm a little confused here.

03:57.425 --> 03:59.593
GEORGE TAKEI:
Oh, my.

03:59.594 --> 04:01.128
Can I help?

04:03.031 --> 04:05.566
Not that kind of confused.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.401
What's George
Takei doing here?

04:07.402 --> 04:10.004
Howard, do you have
latent homosexual tendencies?

04:10.005 --> 04:12.039
No, of course not.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.641
So you say.

04:13.642 --> 04:16.010
Yet, here I am.

04:18.413 --> 04:20.281
George, let me
ask you something.

04:20.281 --> 04:22.149
How did you deal
with being typecast

04:22.150 --> 04:23.617
as a science fiction icon?

04:23.618 --> 04:25.152
It's difficult.

04:25.153 --> 04:27.021
You try and stretch
as an actor--

04:27.022 --> 04:28.455
do Strindberg, O'Neill,

04:28.456 --> 04:32.560
but all they want is,
"Course laid in, Captain."

04:32.561 --> 04:33.827
Tell me about it.

04:33.828 --> 04:37.097
It's frackin'
frustrating.

04:37.098 --> 04:39.333
Wait. Katee,
why are you leaving?

04:39.334 --> 04:42.303
She's leaving because you
really want to be with me.

04:42.304 --> 04:45.873
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, I found my girdle!

04:45.874 --> 04:47.541
It was in the dryer!

04:47.542 --> 04:49.243
Great, Ma!

04:49.244 --> 04:50.678
I think it shrunk!

04:50.679 --> 04:55.015
I'm spilling out like
the Pillsbury Doughboy here!

04:55.016 --> 04:57.151
And with that mental picture,

04:57.152 --> 04:59.720
I think we're done
for the evening.

05:05.327 --> 05:07.428
You know, you never
told me what happened

05:07.429 --> 05:08.762
between you
and Bernadette.

05:08.763 --> 05:10.364
I did a stupid thing.

05:10.365 --> 05:12.800
Yeah, I guessed that.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.335
It was the kind of thing

05:14.336 --> 05:16.837
that makes it kind of hard
to face her now.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.506
That covers anything
from farting in bed

05:19.507 --> 05:22.142
to killing a homeless guy.

05:22.911 --> 05:24.345
Oh, my God.

05:24.346 --> 05:26.280
You ran over a hobo.

05:26.281 --> 05:28.582
No. Stop asking.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.285
All right, fine. So you want to
get back together with her,

05:31.286 --> 05:32.853
but you're too
ashamed to face her

05:32.854 --> 05:34.521
because of whatever
it is you did.

05:34.522 --> 05:35.723
In a nutshell.
Okay.

05:35.724 --> 05:37.424
Well, how about this?

05:37.425 --> 05:39.593
Kidnap Bernadette from the opera

05:39.594 --> 05:42.896
wearing a creepy mask so
she doesn't know it's you.

05:42.897 --> 05:46.900
Now, you see, I don't know
if you're kidding or not.

05:46.901 --> 05:49.003
You're being
unreasonable.

05:49.004 --> 05:51.238
Why can't
I have a desk?!

05:51.239 --> 05:53.407
Our collaboration is a work
of the mind.

05:53.408 --> 05:54.842
We don't need desks.

05:54.843 --> 05:56.076
You have a desk.

05:56.077 --> 05:57.911
Correct.
But I can't have one.

05:57.912 --> 06:00.314
You're two for two.

06:00.315 --> 06:02.082
Why can't he have a desk,
Sheldon?

06:02.083 --> 06:03.817
Oh, Lord, will
this day never end?

06:03.818 --> 06:06.954
As I've explained repeatedly
to Dr. Koothrappali,

06:06.955 --> 06:09.356
whose ability to comprehend
the American idiom fails him

06:09.357 --> 06:10.758
when it's convenient,

06:10.759 --> 06:12.259
there's absolutely
no money

06:12.260 --> 06:14.862
in my budget for
additional office furniture.

06:14.863 --> 06:17.765
Oh, but there's money
for a drawer full of Red Vines,

06:17.766 --> 06:19.366
a marshmallow shooting rifle,

06:19.367 --> 06:23.003
and a super executive ant farm
with glow-in-the-dark sand?

06:23.004 --> 06:26.240
Yes.

06:26.241 --> 06:27.908
Okay, what if he
buys his own desk?

06:27.909 --> 06:29.476
Yeah, what
if I buy my own desk?

06:29.477 --> 06:31.145
That's ridiculous.
Why?

06:31.146 --> 06:33.347
Because...

06:36.651 --> 06:37.885
Yes?

06:37.886 --> 06:40.487
It's my office.

06:41.456 --> 06:43.157
Sheldon.
All right, all right.

06:43.158 --> 06:45.025
He can buy his own desk.

06:45.026 --> 06:46.794
And I can put it in your office?

06:46.795 --> 06:48.162
Well, you really want

06:48.163 --> 06:50.464
to dot the I's and cross
the T's, don't you?

06:51.533 --> 06:53.133
Why would you want
a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?

06:53.134 --> 06:55.869
They do some
of their best work at night.

07:01.743 --> 07:03.477
Ah, it's okay.

07:05.780 --> 07:06.747
Penny?

07:06.748 --> 07:08.315
Penny?

07:08.316 --> 07:10.517
Penny?

07:15.490 --> 07:17.725
Penny?

07:20.662 --> 07:23.297
Would you have opened the door
if you knew it was me?

07:23.298 --> 07:24.565
Not since I found out

07:24.566 --> 07:27.801
the teddy bear you gave me
had a webcam in it.

07:27.802 --> 07:30.504
I just have a question.

07:30.505 --> 07:33.073
Does Bernadette
ever talk about me?

07:33.074 --> 07:34.041
Oh, absolutely.

07:34.042 --> 07:35.275
She does?
Yeah, sure.

07:35.276 --> 07:36.343
Just yesterday, she asked,

07:36.344 --> 07:38.779
"Why is Howard hiding
under the table?"

07:38.780 --> 07:41.215
She saw that, huh?

07:41.216 --> 07:42.416
Oh, no, not at first.

07:42.417 --> 07:44.351
Right after I pointed it out.

07:44.352 --> 07:45.919
Let me ask you something else.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.255
Is she seeing anybody?

07:48.256 --> 07:49.690
Oh, not that I know of.

07:49.691 --> 07:51.125
Hey, while
we're on the subject,

07:51.126 --> 07:52.793
why did you guys break up
anyway?

07:52.794 --> 07:54.862
Oh, I'd rather not say.

07:54.863 --> 07:57.097
Howard, if you want my help,
I've got to know what happened.

07:57.098 --> 07:58.632
But it's embarrassing...

07:58.633 --> 08:01.301
Yeah, that's what
I'm counting on. Spill.

08:02.403 --> 08:05.873
Okay. Well, you know
<i>World of Warcraft?</i>

08:05.874 --> 08:07.541
Um, the online game? Sure.

08:07.542 --> 08:08.976
Well, did you know

08:08.977 --> 08:12.713
that the characters in the game
can have sex with each other?

08:14.182 --> 08:18.051
Oh, God. I think
I see where this is going.

08:18.052 --> 08:20.654
Her name was
Glissinda the Troll.

08:22.590 --> 08:24.625
Bernadette walked in on me

08:24.626 --> 08:26.827
while we were doing
the cyber-nasty

08:26.828 --> 08:28.896
under the Bridge of Souls.

08:28.897 --> 08:31.098
Oh, you're right.

08:31.099 --> 08:32.966
That is so embarrassing.

08:32.967 --> 08:35.135
Would you talk to her?

08:35.135 --> 08:37.171
Bernadette or the troll?

08:37.172 --> 08:39.173
Bernadette. She
was so mad at me,

08:39.174 --> 08:41.808
she wouldn't even listen
to my side of the story.

08:41.809 --> 08:43.243
Well, what was your side?

08:43.244 --> 08:44.478
Well, for all we know,

08:44.479 --> 08:46.480
Glissinda the Troll
wasn't even a real woman.

08:46.481 --> 08:48.816
I mean, she could've been
a 50-year-old truck driver

08:48.817 --> 08:50.751
in New Jersey.

08:50.752 --> 08:54.454
Really? And that didn't
make her feel better?

08:54.455 --> 08:57.791
Will you talk to her, see
if there's any chance at all

08:57.792 --> 08:59.426
we could get back together?

08:59.427 --> 09:00.994
Oh, gee, Howard,
I really don't want

09:00.995 --> 09:02.496
to get in the middle of this.

09:02.497 --> 09:04.064
No. Why would you?

09:04.065 --> 09:08.402
I'm just another lonely
nerd, living with his mother,

09:08.403 --> 09:11.305
trying to find any scrap
of happiness he can.

09:11.306 --> 09:14.441
You know, maybe to make up
for the fact that his dad

09:14.442 --> 09:16.310
left him when
he was 11.

09:16.311 --> 09:18.645
Okay, I will think about it.

09:18.646 --> 09:21.148
You know, I've always
blamed myself

09:21.149 --> 09:22.583
for him leaving.

09:22.584 --> 09:26.153
I always thought it was because
I wasn't the son he wanted.

09:26.154 --> 09:27.621
Yeah, I said I'd
think about it.

09:27.622 --> 09:30.190
I wasn't athletic,
yeah, I was kind of sickly...

09:30.191 --> 09:32.860
Okay, fine. Look, look,
I'm calling her now! See?!

09:32.861 --> 09:35.329
Thank you.

09:37.732 --> 09:39.099
So anyway,
Howard asked Penny

09:39.100 --> 09:40.934
to talk to Bernadette,
and she did,

09:40.935 --> 09:43.737
and Bernadette agreed to meet
him for a cup of coffee.

09:43.738 --> 09:45.138
One question.
Yeah?

09:45.139 --> 09:47.908
Why on earth
are you telling me all this?

09:47.909 --> 09:49.910
I don't know.

09:49.911 --> 09:52.312
Sometimes your movements
are so lifelike,

09:52.313 --> 09:54.815
I forget you're
not a real boy.

10:15.012 --> 10:16.779
You said I could
buy a desk.

10:16.780 --> 10:18.915
This isn't a <i>desk.</i>

10:18.916 --> 10:22.852
This is a...
Brobdingnagian
monstrosity.

10:22.853 --> 10:24.821
Is that the American idiom

10:24.822 --> 10:27.724
for "giant, big-ass desk"?

10:27.725 --> 10:30.560
It's actually British.

10:30.561 --> 10:32.195
Can you say it again for me?

10:32.196 --> 10:33.796
Brobdingnagian.

10:33.797 --> 10:34.897
One more time?

10:34.898 --> 10:37.166
Brobdingnagian.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.568
Now three times fast?

10:38.569 --> 10:40.570
Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna...

10:44.041 --> 10:45.842
How did you even
get it in here?

10:45.843 --> 10:49.145
That's for me, Ramon, Julio,
Jesus and Rodrigo to know

10:49.146 --> 10:50.713
and you to find out.

10:50.714 --> 10:54.283
All right, you've
made your point.

10:54.284 --> 10:57.153
A fine prank, very amusing.

10:57.154 --> 10:59.656
Now get it out.

10:59.657 --> 11:01.057
No.

11:01.058 --> 11:02.258
Yes.

11:02.259 --> 11:03.259
Yes.
No.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.861
Yes!
I have three brothers

11:04.862 --> 11:07.630
and two sisters, Sheldon--
I can do this all day.

11:07.631 --> 11:10.333
All right, if you're
not going to remove it,

11:10.334 --> 11:11.934
I'll remove it for you.

11:11.935 --> 11:13.236
Knock yourself out.

11:25.015 --> 11:27.550
Help me move my desk.

11:27.551 --> 11:28.685
No.
Yes.

11:28.686 --> 11:29.752
No.
Yes.

11:29.753 --> 11:33.489
No. It's too Brobdingnagian.

11:33.490 --> 11:36.426
Why do you even want this here?

11:36.427 --> 11:39.696
Its size is completely
disproportionate
to its purpose.

11:39.697 --> 11:41.964
Well, seeing as its purpose
was to piss you off,

11:41.965 --> 11:44.967
I'd say it's spot-on.

11:46.336 --> 11:48.838
All right, I see
what's going on.

11:48.839 --> 11:51.607
This is the opening
salvo in what will be

11:51.608 --> 11:55.712
an escalating series of
juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.

11:55.713 --> 11:57.947
Well titted.

11:57.948 --> 11:58.948
Thank you.

11:58.949 --> 12:01.918
Stand by for my upcoming tat.

12:01.919 --> 12:03.019
Hey, Sheldon?

12:03.020 --> 12:04.053
Yes?

12:04.054 --> 12:05.855
No.

12:05.856 --> 12:08.458
See what I did there?
I turned it around.

12:14.031 --> 12:15.398
Sorry,

12:15.399 --> 12:16.632
I had to clock out.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.034
Oh, no, that's okay.

12:18.035 --> 12:20.069
How have you been?

12:20.070 --> 12:23.806
Okay. You know,
busy, schoolwork. You?

12:23.807 --> 12:26.809
Same. I took a scuba-diving
course over the summer,

12:26.810 --> 12:30.346
but it turns out I'm
terrified of the ocean.

12:30.347 --> 12:32.014
Too bad.

12:32.015 --> 12:36.385
You wouldn't know anybody
who wants to buy a wet
suit, boy's large?

12:37.554 --> 12:40.056
Yeah, forget it.
Not important.

12:40.057 --> 12:43.259
So, are you
seeing anyone?

12:43.260 --> 12:45.228
Well, to be honest, I...
Hey, how are we

12:45.229 --> 12:47.396
doing over here? Can I
get you something to drink?

12:47.397 --> 12:49.165
Not for me, thanks.
I'm okay.

12:49.166 --> 12:50.633
Are you gonna want
to order food?

12:50.634 --> 12:51.667
Maybe later.
Okay.

12:51.668 --> 12:53.736
So, are you seeing anybody?

12:53.737 --> 12:54.871
No.

12:54.872 --> 12:56.839
That's what I told him
when he asked me.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.641
I hope that's not out of line.

12:58.642 --> 13:01.778
No, it's fine.
Penny, can we have
a little privacy?

13:01.779 --> 13:04.347
Oh. I'm sorry.

13:05.716 --> 13:09.352
What about you,
have you been seeing anybody?

13:09.353 --> 13:11.687
Well, you know
how it is with guys.

13:11.688 --> 13:13.289
I mean, we have needs and...

13:13.290 --> 13:15.424
So you've been seeing
other girls?

13:15.425 --> 13:18.361
Well, not real girls.

13:19.897 --> 13:23.199
Does that mean slutty trolls?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.400
You know, you look thirsty.

13:24.401 --> 13:26.402
I brought you some iced tea.
Thank you.

13:26.403 --> 13:28.304
It's passion fruit,
new on the menu.

13:28.305 --> 13:30.540
I know. I work here.
Oh, sorry.

13:31.575 --> 13:33.543
Yeah, you're right. Doy.

13:33.544 --> 13:34.644
So, Howard,

13:34.645 --> 13:35.745
yay or nay?

13:35.746 --> 13:38.281
Isn't there somewhere else
you can be?

13:38.282 --> 13:40.550
Not where I can hear you guys.

13:42.553 --> 13:43.953
Okay, fine.

13:45.055 --> 13:48.391
I'll admit, there are dark,
sordid little corners

13:48.392 --> 13:50.693
of the Internet
where the name Wolowizard

13:50.694 --> 13:52.562
is whispered in hushed tones.

13:53.797 --> 13:56.165
The only reason I go there,

13:56.166 --> 13:58.234
the only reason
I've ever gone there

13:58.235 --> 14:01.637
is because I don't have
a real woman in my life.

14:02.673 --> 14:05.641
You happy?
Yeah, that'll hold me
for a while.

14:07.244 --> 14:09.111
Howard, you did have
a real woman.

14:09.112 --> 14:11.247
I was right there
in the next room

14:11.248 --> 14:14.483
while you were clicking
that troll's brains out.

14:16.854 --> 14:18.921
Yeah, but we
weren't...

14:18.922 --> 14:20.590
I-I mean, you
and I never...

14:20.591 --> 14:21.858
Had sex?

14:21.859 --> 14:22.925
Yeah.

14:22.926 --> 14:24.227
Well, whose fault was that?

14:24.228 --> 14:26.596
Complimentary nachos!

14:27.431 --> 14:29.198
You enjoy.

14:29.199 --> 14:31.767
Never had sex? Wow.

14:31.768 --> 14:34.637
What do you mean,
whose fault was that?

14:34.638 --> 14:36.205
Well, we could've
been having sex,

14:36.206 --> 14:37.640
but you never made the move.

14:37.641 --> 14:40.109
I didn't think you wanted me
to make the move.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.012
Howard, a girl doesn't go out
with a man like you,

14:43.013 --> 14:44.881
with your looks,
your fancy patter

14:44.882 --> 14:48.451
and your tight hoochie pants
if she's not expecting him

14:48.452 --> 14:51.053
to eventually make the move.

14:51.054 --> 14:52.722
Really?

14:52.723 --> 14:53.789
Really.

14:53.790 --> 14:56.692
Son of a bitch.

14:56.693 --> 14:59.462
Hey, this is a little awkward,
but my manager says

14:59.463 --> 15:01.564
I can't actually
give nachos away.

15:01.565 --> 15:05.001
So... just take that
when you're ready.

15:07.404 --> 15:09.372
Yeah, we had
a really great talk,

15:09.373 --> 15:11.641
and we're gonna start
seeing each other again.

15:11.642 --> 15:12.742
Oh, congratulations.

15:12.743 --> 15:16.078
Have you broken it
to the troll yet?

15:16.079 --> 15:17.880
Did Penny tell you about that?

15:17.881 --> 15:19.849
No. Steve Patterson told me.

15:19.850 --> 15:23.953
The greasy old fat guy
in Facilities Management?

15:23.954 --> 15:26.255
Yeah.
How'd he know about it?

15:26.256 --> 15:29.058
He's Glissinda the troll.

15:29.059 --> 15:30.760
Sorry, dude,

15:30.761 --> 15:32.762
the thermostat's
on my side of the room,

15:32.763 --> 15:37.033
so it stays Mumbai hot
in here until you turn off
that stupid Indian music!

15:37.034 --> 15:38.701
I'll turn off the music

15:38.702 --> 15:41.137
when you get rid of that
salmonella-ridden parakeet!

15:41.138 --> 15:44.340
Oh, too bad! Sheldon's
pathologically
afraid of birds!

15:44.341 --> 15:47.677
Hey, look, Sheldon!
Birdie, birdie, birdie!

15:47.678 --> 15:50.379
That's it! Prepare
for marshmallow death!

15:50.380 --> 15:51.981
Eat flaming Nerf!

16:01.959 --> 16:03.826
So anyway...

16:03.827 --> 16:06.228
That's great news
about you and Bernadette.

16:06.229 --> 16:08.698
Yeah. I think I'm gonna take
her to miniature golf.

16:08.699 --> 16:09.799
Ah. Well, I guess

16:09.800 --> 16:12.835
for you guys that's
like regular golf.

16:12.836 --> 16:15.671
Short jokes? Really?
You're, like,

16:15.672 --> 16:17.340
a quarter of an inch
taller than me.

16:17.341 --> 16:19.976
Yeah, and don't
you forget it.

16:21.178 --> 16:23.813
I had a good time.

16:23.814 --> 16:25.481
Me, too.

16:25.482 --> 16:28.551
Kiss her good night.

16:33.490 --> 16:34.991
All right, now a little tongue.

16:34.992 --> 16:36.459
GEORGE TAKEI:
Hold on there.

16:38.261 --> 16:41.630
We've only just rekindled
the romance.

16:41.631 --> 16:46.736
Let's not sully the moment
with the exchange of saliva.

16:46.737 --> 16:48.738
Don't listen to him.

16:48.739 --> 16:50.206
She wants it.

16:50.207 --> 16:51.273
Tongue.

16:51.274 --> 16:53.476
La, la, la, la, la.

16:54.644 --> 16:56.479
See?

16:58.448 --> 17:00.116
Now make the move.

17:00.117 --> 17:02.151
Mm-mmm.
Too soon.

17:02.152 --> 17:03.953
Trust me, she's ready.

17:03.954 --> 17:05.320
Make the move.

17:05.321 --> 17:06.422
No, no, no.

17:06.423 --> 17:09.458
A lady wants to be wooed,

17:09.459 --> 17:13.029
courted slowly.

17:13.030 --> 17:15.931
How would <i>you</i> know?

17:15.932 --> 17:18.867
I read.

17:18.868 --> 17:21.237
Listen to me, Howard, it's time.

17:21.238 --> 17:23.506
Make the move, now.

17:26.009 --> 17:28.044
Mm! What are you doing?

17:28.045 --> 17:32.014
You said... well,
the "move," remember?

17:32.015 --> 17:33.115
Oh, not <i>now.</i>

17:33.116 --> 17:34.417
We're starting a
new relationship.

17:34.418 --> 17:36.452
I need to get to
know you again.

17:36.453 --> 17:37.720
No, you don't.

17:37.721 --> 17:39.255
It's <i>me.</i>

17:39.256 --> 17:41.924
The lusty charmer
with the fancy patter

17:41.925 --> 17:44.160
and the hoochie pants.

17:44.161 --> 17:47.963
Be patient;
we'll get there.

17:55.038 --> 17:57.073
Told you.

18:01.573 --> 18:04.775
Oh, God, what's that smell?

18:05.559 --> 18:07.060
Oh-ho-hoo!

18:08.062 --> 18:09.929
Yes?

18:09.930 --> 18:12.365
What are you
doing in there?

18:12.366 --> 18:15.835
I'm making
hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia gas.

18:15.836 --> 18:19.439
Just a little experiment
in pest control.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.275
It's not gonna work, dude;
I grew up in India--

18:22.276 --> 18:24.777
an entire subcontinent
where cows walk in the street,

18:24.778 --> 18:27.480
and nobody has ever had
a solid bowel movement.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.817
Well, we'll just see
how long you can hold out.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.984
Well, we'll just see how

18:31.985 --> 18:34.120
your noxious gas fares
against my cinnamon-

18:34.121 --> 18:37.690
apple-scented
aroma therapy candles.

18:37.691 --> 18:40.426
Didn't you say you're
making hydrogen sulfide gas?

18:40.427 --> 18:42.462
Yes.
Isn't that flammable?

18:42.463 --> 18:43.730
Highly.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.499
Oh, dear.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.809
This is not over.
