Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:07.827 --> 00:10.620
Welcome to the second premiere

00:10.620 --> 00:12.551
of RuPaul's Drag Race
official.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.068
By the end of tomorrow,

00:16.068 --> 00:19.137
I'll be asking one of you
to sashay away.

00:20.827 --> 00:22.517
Daya Betty.

00:22.517 --> 00:24.344
It was pretty lackluster.

00:24.344 --> 00:26.241
DeJa Skye.

00:26.241 --> 00:27.413
It really wasn't funny.

00:27.413 --> 00:29.344
Angeria.

00:29.344 --> 00:32.896
Oh, my God, I love this.
It was so good.

00:32.896 --> 00:34.931
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

00:36.172 --> 00:39.517
DeJa Skye, shantay you stay.

00:39.517 --> 00:42.206
Daya Betty, sashay away.

00:53.172 --> 00:56.206
Oof, that was a fucking doozy.

00:56.206 --> 00:57.413
Bitch.

00:57.413 --> 00:58.689
I was close to being eliminated.

00:58.689 --> 01:00.586
-Aw!
-Oh, my God.

01:00.586 --> 01:03.034
But I think
that me lip syncing

01:03.034 --> 01:05.620
made them know
that I am a competitor.

01:05.620 --> 01:08.241
RuPaul himself said

01:08.241 --> 01:10.827
that we might have a lip sync
assassin on our hands.

01:10.827 --> 01:13.448
Bitches, beware.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.551
We're gonna miss you, Daya.

01:14.551 --> 01:15.724
-Daya!
-Daya!

01:15.724 --> 01:18.034
I love you so much, Daya!

01:18.034 --> 01:21.482
What?

01:21.482 --> 01:22.724
Queens, I'm back!

01:22.724 --> 01:25.241
But I'm not the only one.

01:25.241 --> 01:26.793
Look over there.

01:28.034 --> 01:30.482
-Baby?
-What the hell?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.931
Oh, shit.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.310
Oh, my God!

01:37.310 --> 01:38.758
Oh. It's the other ho's.

01:38.758 --> 01:40.482
-Oh, okay!
-Oh, my God!

01:40.482 --> 01:41.862
Oh, it's like that?

01:41.862 --> 01:44.758
Oh, my God,
my other sisters are here.

01:44.758 --> 01:47.655
But, girl, y'all bitches
are gonna have to get out soon.

01:47.655 --> 01:51.103
Oh, yes!

01:51.103 --> 01:53.413
The two titans
are about to clash

01:53.413 --> 01:55.310
in a royal battle
of bad bitchery.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.689
And we about to see

01:56.689 --> 01:59.965
who the fuck else
is here in this competition.

01:59.965 --> 02:02.103
Hi, sisters!

02:03.379 --> 02:07.551
I see Kerri Colby,
and I am freaking out.

02:07.551 --> 02:09.379
I am such a huge fan.

02:09.379 --> 02:12.482
Oh, you fucking bitch.

02:12.482 --> 02:16.724
Miss Kornbread JetÃ©,
my good, thicc sis.

02:16.724 --> 02:18.379
-I'm so happy that you're here.
-Aah!

02:18.379 --> 02:21.689
DeJa Skye. Bitch, that's
my seamstress right there.

02:21.689 --> 02:23.758
-Gooped, gagged, and gathered.
-Hola!

02:23.758 --> 02:27.827
I know Alyssa Hunter
by watching her pageants online.

02:27.827 --> 02:29.206
Girl, she's gonna be
really tough to beat,

02:29.206 --> 02:32.068
because those pageant girls,
they're cutthroat.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.310
Who went off?

02:33.310 --> 02:34.862
-Daya Betty.
-Her name was Daya Betty.

02:34.862 --> 02:36.344
Who left from your guys?

02:36.344 --> 02:39.241
From our group,
Orion Story, yeah.

02:39.241 --> 02:40.413
How was she?

02:40.413 --> 02:42.068
It clearly was
a short story, girl.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.344
A plot?

02:45.344 --> 02:48.000
And also, is there anybody
in y'all group that's messy?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.551
You sure the messy's
in our group?

02:51.620 --> 02:54.344
No, it's me.
No, 100%, yeah.

02:54.344 --> 02:55.827
Kornbread is a sweetheart,
but, yes, I'm a messy bitch.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.413
I'm all about fun shade.

02:57.413 --> 02:58.862
She bring it to you
every bowl.

03:00.620 --> 03:03.620
Kornbread, she looks
like a good time,

03:03.620 --> 03:06.413
but, girl, Miss Thing
got on a Mary J. Blige wig.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.862
Now that we're all together,

03:09.862 --> 03:12.413
competition's gonna get
severe up in here.

03:12.413 --> 03:15.344
It feels hotter already, bitch.

03:15.344 --> 03:17.620
Now that we're all in a group,
it kind of puts into perspective

03:17.620 --> 03:20.034
how much of a fight
it's gonna be,

03:20.034 --> 03:21.448
because there are
so many girls.

03:21.448 --> 03:23.448
It is scary, you know?

03:23.448 --> 03:26.344
But I am totally fine
with ripping my pearls

03:26.344 --> 03:27.827
and throwing it on the stage
for the girls

03:27.827 --> 03:29.310
so they can trip and fall.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.172
I wanted to be
the littlest one.

03:31.172 --> 03:33.517
Yeah, you've got another child
here with you, baby. I'm sorry.

03:40.862 --> 03:42.517
The winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race

03:42.517 --> 03:44.034
receives a one-year supply

03:44.034 --> 03:46.586
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

03:46.586 --> 03:50.000
and a grand prize of $100,000,

03:50.000 --> 03:51.655
powered by Cash App.

03:51.655 --> 03:53.172
With extra-special guest judge,

03:53.172 --> 03:55.344
fromBling Empire,
Christine Chiu.

04:03.896 --> 04:04.896
Good morning!

04:04.896 --> 04:07.206
Hello, hello.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.793
-Another day, another dollar.
-Oh, my God!

04:09.793 --> 04:11.103
Catchphrase!

04:11.103 --> 04:12.620
Walking into the werkroom
this morning,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.000
many new faces.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.689
It's a little bit more
claustrophobic today.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.793
It feels kind of like
a full factory reset.

04:18.793 --> 04:20.655
Like, I did really well
my first week.

04:20.655 --> 04:23.000
Whatever I just served
was good enough for six.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.827
Let's amp it up for 12.

04:25.931 --> 04:27.827
Hello, hello, hello!

04:30.758 --> 04:32.620
So the gang's all here.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.241
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

04:34.241 --> 04:38.034
Like my mama used to say,
the more, the merrier,

04:38.034 --> 04:41.827
which is why I want
to introduce you

04:41.827 --> 04:43.724
to two more queens.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.034
-What?
-Oh, what?

04:47.034 --> 04:48.965
Oh, damn it.

04:48.965 --> 04:50.758
Bring back my girls.

04:52.206 --> 04:53.965
Betty's back!

04:56.413 --> 04:59.206
Miss Junebug, I'm ready for
my rematch in the parking lot.

05:00.344 --> 05:02.586
I'm back.

05:02.586 --> 05:05.655
Going home first and then
the second chance to come back,

05:05.655 --> 05:07.689
I really have to prove myself
this time.

05:07.689 --> 05:09.517
Oh, my God!

05:09.517 --> 05:12.310
I am probably more fiery
coming in the second time,

05:12.310 --> 05:13.724
because these bitches

05:13.724 --> 05:16.206
don't think I'm competition,
I don't think.

05:16.206 --> 05:17.896
And I can't wait
to prove them wrong.

05:17.896 --> 05:22.103
Welcome back, Orion Story
and Daya Betty.

05:22.103 --> 05:23.517
I'm giving these queens

05:23.517 --> 05:25.896
a second chance
to compete for the crown.

05:25.896 --> 05:27.931
It's the right thing to do.

05:29.310 --> 05:33.310
You just brought back
Thelma and Louise.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.137
Oh, this some bullshit.

05:35.137 --> 05:37.103
Straight-up bullshit.

05:37.103 --> 05:41.137
But let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

05:41.137 --> 05:45.551
From this moment on,
no more Mr. Nice Guy.

05:45.551 --> 05:50.000
Because this season, we're doing
things a little differently,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.068
and when it comes
to saving queens,

05:52.068 --> 05:55.758
I'm leaving it up
to the drag gods.

05:57.413 --> 05:58.413
Oh, Pit Crew?

05:58.413 --> 06:00.896
-Oh!
-Okay.

06:00.896 --> 06:04.793
Now, this tray
has 14 RuPaul candy bars,

06:04.793 --> 06:06.275
one for each of you.

06:06.275 --> 06:10.379
But only one bar
is golden, girl.

06:11.689 --> 06:14.310
I'll let you each
choose your candy bar

06:14.310 --> 06:15.827
and sign it.

06:15.827 --> 06:20.206
Each week, the two queens
lip syncing for their lives

06:20.206 --> 06:23.068
will bring their candy
to the runway.

06:23.068 --> 06:25.586
The queen that
loses the lip sync

06:25.586 --> 06:27.689
will open her candy bar.

06:27.689 --> 06:29.310
If it is the gold bar...

06:31.793 --> 06:34.310
She'll be safe
to slay another day.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.724
If her bar is chocolate,

06:38.724 --> 06:41.068
she must sashay away.

06:42.241 --> 06:44.034
This, like, changes the game.

06:44.034 --> 06:47.689
It gives you a second chance,
or a third chance if it's me.

06:48.896 --> 06:53.241
Now, you may pick a bar
one at a time,

06:53.241 --> 06:56.172
starting with last week's
winner, Angeria.

06:56.172 --> 06:57.758
-Yeah!
-Oh!

06:57.758 --> 07:00.689
It is full wild card situation.

07:00.689 --> 07:02.620
Sign here, initial there.

07:02.620 --> 07:05.103
The immunity, I'm, like,
super excited, girl,

07:05.103 --> 07:06.758
because, like,
if the worst happens,

07:06.758 --> 07:09.689
I hope mine
has the golden ticket.

07:09.689 --> 07:11.896
Willy Wonka fish.

07:11.896 --> 07:14.068
Girl, we are in
the Willy Wonka factory.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.931
These people got golden
chocolate bars and stuff.

07:16.931 --> 07:17.931
I just hope I get it.

07:17.931 --> 07:20.068
Oh, you're big.

07:20.068 --> 07:22.310
You wanna make it
on the clipboard?

07:22.310 --> 07:23.517
Oh, sorry.

07:23.517 --> 07:24.689
It's a straight thing.

07:24.689 --> 07:26.448
Baby, you done forgot
your candy bar.

07:26.448 --> 07:28.310
-Oh! I'm just--
-He got all flustered!

07:28.310 --> 07:29.517
All flustered!

07:29.517 --> 07:31.206
Something is changing!

07:34.344 --> 07:35.896
So now that
they're signed and sealed,

07:35.896 --> 07:38.379
keep your bars safe,

07:38.379 --> 07:43.000
because one of them
could save your padded ass.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.275
But whatever you do,
do not open it.

07:48.517 --> 07:53.206
Now, there's only one thing
I love more than chocolate,

07:53.206 --> 07:56.517
and that is a pair of balls.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.000
So for this week's
maxi-challenge,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.517
we are throwing
two fashion balls, darling.

08:04.517 --> 08:08.620
My week-one queens,
you will be serving three looks

08:08.620 --> 08:11.137
at the Hide 'n Chic Ball.

08:11.137 --> 08:13.517
First look
is Zebra Print Resort.

08:13.517 --> 08:17.448
Second look is Leopard
Evening Gown Down.

08:17.448 --> 08:18.448
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

08:18.448 --> 08:20.793
Third look, from scratch,

08:20.793 --> 08:25.172
you need to create and serve
Wedding Gown Eleganza.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.000
-Wow!
-Ooh!

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Using all the colors
of the animal rainbow.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.482
And don't get it twisted.

08:31.482 --> 08:33.034
All the animal skins

08:33.034 --> 08:35.896
are as fake
as a latex breastplate.

08:37.620 --> 08:38.620
All right, week-two queens,

08:38.620 --> 08:40.896
you'll be serving three looks

08:40.896 --> 08:43.344
in the Red, White,
& Blue Ball.

08:43.344 --> 08:45.068
-Oh!
-Oh!

08:45.068 --> 08:47.241
First look, Red Hot Resort.

08:47.241 --> 08:52.068
Second look, Evening Gown Down:
All In White.

08:52.068 --> 08:54.275
And the third look,
from scratch,

08:54.275 --> 08:57.793
you need to create
Wedding Gown Eleganza

08:57.793 --> 09:01.137
in red, white, and blue.

09:01.137 --> 09:04.965
Feel free to use the sewing
machines provided by Singer.

09:04.965 --> 09:08.000
This is what I came here for.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.275
I'm a sewer.
I love creating,

09:10.275 --> 09:11.482
I love balls!

09:11.482 --> 09:13.793
Racers, start your engines,

09:13.793 --> 09:16.344
and may the best drag queen win.

09:17.965 --> 09:19.275
Coming up...

09:19.275 --> 09:21.931
This is the challenge
I came here to destroy.

09:21.931 --> 09:23.034
So what do you think of this?

09:34.034 --> 09:35.206
Okay, here it is.
Take that.

09:35.206 --> 09:36.586
I want this one.

09:36.586 --> 09:39.689
Honey, it is the ball challenge
this week.

09:39.689 --> 09:42.034
Not just one ball, bitch,
two balls.

09:42.034 --> 09:43.827
Oh, we're really feeling it.

09:43.827 --> 09:45.517
-Ooh!
-Ooh, girls.

09:45.517 --> 09:47.793
My ball is the Red,
White, & Blue Ball.

09:47.793 --> 09:49.586
-This is so cute!
-I know, a pom-pom.

09:49.586 --> 09:52.965
Ooh, I am so excited.

09:52.965 --> 09:55.896
This is mine.
Nobody touch.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.137
Mine.

09:58.137 --> 10:00.448
I am so happy
to have animal prints.

10:00.448 --> 10:01.793
Like, they speak to me

10:01.793 --> 10:04.275
on, like, a really, like,

10:04.275 --> 10:07.275
spiritual,
existentially trashy level.

10:07.275 --> 10:09.655
So when I see, like,
these different animal prints,

10:09.655 --> 10:13.862
my brain immediately goes to,
like, villainous hot bitch.

10:13.862 --> 10:17.172
So I may have gathered
from certain contextual clues

10:17.172 --> 10:21.931
that you are one of these, um,
how do we say, heterosexuals?

10:21.931 --> 10:23.068
Yes.

10:23.068 --> 10:25.793
Do you have
a significant other?

10:25.793 --> 10:28.034
I do.
My girlfriend.

10:28.034 --> 10:30.517
We've been together
for about four years now.

10:30.517 --> 10:33.034
That's so fucking cool.

10:33.034 --> 10:34.793
Miss Maddy, I heard
you were straight.

10:34.793 --> 10:35.965
I am.

10:35.965 --> 10:37.344
Are you at the point
where, like,

10:37.344 --> 10:39.068
opinions of others
don't bother you?

10:39.068 --> 10:41.103
Because obviously, people
have their opinions about it.

10:41.103 --> 10:43.344
Being, like, a part,
like, in the drag scene,

10:43.344 --> 10:45.137
like, a part of,
like, in this community,

10:45.137 --> 10:46.827
it's, like,
changed my perspective.

10:46.827 --> 10:48.034
It's, like,
I'm not worried about

10:48.034 --> 10:49.103
if other people think
that I'm gay,

10:49.103 --> 10:50.413
because I don't consider
being gay

10:50.413 --> 10:51.551
to be, like, something
that's, like, offensive.

10:51.551 --> 10:52.724
-That's a bad thing, yeah.
-Yeah.

10:52.724 --> 10:54.068
How does your girlfriend
feel about it?

10:54.068 --> 10:55.620
She's honestly, like,
my biggest supporter.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.137
-Shut up. Seriously?
-Yeah.

10:57.137 --> 10:58.724
The first time she ever met me,
I was in drag.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.379
Well, that's really cool.
I'm glad she's supportive.

11:00.379 --> 11:02.758
And you've got a lot of
supportive people here, too.

11:02.758 --> 11:04.379
I knew you were straight,

11:04.379 --> 11:07.931
because my left nipple
only gets hard for straight men.

11:07.931 --> 11:08.896
Maddy, you straight?

11:08.896 --> 11:10.310
-I am.
-Hi!

11:10.310 --> 11:12.793
Bitch, did you miss
the whole damn conversation?

11:12.793 --> 11:14.793
This bitch five days late.

11:14.793 --> 11:16.034
Damn.

11:19.068 --> 11:21.000
I think I'm gonna do
a lot of paneling on mine,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.896
so it's, like,
a lot of different shapes,

11:22.896 --> 11:25.724
like, with different
patchwork of fabrics.

11:25.724 --> 11:28.103
I'm known back at home
as a dancing queen,

11:28.103 --> 11:30.448
but I am also known as a girl

11:30.448 --> 11:33.448
who makes a brand-new costume
every week for herself.

11:33.448 --> 11:36.275
This is the challenge
I came here to destroy.

11:36.275 --> 11:37.793
So what do you think of this?

11:37.793 --> 11:41.793
A star here, and then maybe
a shawl coming off?

11:41.793 --> 11:44.310
I feel like
it reads very Jasmine.

11:44.310 --> 11:45.689
-Right.

11:49.482 --> 11:51.068
I don't sew.

11:51.068 --> 11:53.241
I don't even consider myself
a crafty queen.

11:53.241 --> 11:56.931
Like, the only Kraft I enjoy
is macaroni and cheese.

11:56.931 --> 12:00.344
So I'm literally over here
draping, pinning, and praying.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.448
-Bosco.
-What's up, baby?

12:02.448 --> 12:03.724
Hot mess.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.206
I love those colors together.

12:05.206 --> 12:07.586
But the silhouette, a hot mess.

12:07.586 --> 12:09.137
The silhouette's
not working for you.

12:09.137 --> 12:12.793
I don't know. Definitely be
careful with the details, baby.

12:12.793 --> 12:15.896
Like, I work
as a personal stylist,

12:15.896 --> 12:18.068
so I know how to make
shit look good.

12:18.068 --> 12:22.793
I'm hoping the fashion gods
will lead and guide me.

12:22.793 --> 12:24.034
Let us pray.

12:25.827 --> 12:29.103
-Make it work, designers.

12:29.103 --> 12:31.827
I've been sewing for years,
and not just for myself.

12:31.827 --> 12:33.620
I've sewn for many other queens.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.241
I know my capabilities,

12:35.241 --> 12:37.413
and I wanna make sure
that I show this off.

12:37.413 --> 12:38.379
This is gonna be a moment.

12:38.379 --> 12:40.586
I hope.

12:40.586 --> 12:41.827
I wanna make sure there's darts.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.413
I wanna make sure
there's a full neckline

12:43.413 --> 12:45.068
and a dramatic sleeve.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.344
I wanna give the drama.

12:46.344 --> 12:49.517
This is kind of
my area of expertise.

12:49.517 --> 12:50.724
Ooh, bitch, it is.

12:50.724 --> 12:52.758
So if I don't...

12:56.068 --> 12:57.655
Pblblblt.

12:57.655 --> 12:58.965
Do I look like I sew to you?

12:58.965 --> 13:01.448
What is wrong with this?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.620
No. Imma answer it for you.
I really don't.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.793
I don't think I'm
an atelier diva like that.

13:05.793 --> 13:07.827
Okay, let me go
to Miss Jasmine.

13:07.827 --> 13:10.103
Miss Jasmine,
I'm coming to you, bitch.

13:10.103 --> 13:11.724
What you need help with?

13:11.724 --> 13:14.103
I'm getting a little bit of help
from Miss Jasmine Kennedie.

13:14.103 --> 13:15.689
So I'm trying to do
a little thing here.

13:15.689 --> 13:17.000
Gathered?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.482
Well, I'm attaching this,
I think, here.

13:19.482 --> 13:21.551
Okay. I am helping
my girl Kerri out

13:21.551 --> 13:25.448
because she is the daughter
of Sasha Colby.

13:25.448 --> 13:27.379
Her mother is one
of my favorite queens,

13:27.379 --> 13:30.206
so the fact that I'm getting
to compete with her daughter

13:30.206 --> 13:32.379
is just, like,
a dream come true.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.241
Listen, if we have to stone
on top of the safety pins,

13:35.241 --> 13:36.241
that's what we gonna
have to do. Okay? Listen...

13:36.241 --> 13:38.310
I'll try some stones.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.206
You got some stones?
You sharing?

13:40.206 --> 13:42.793
Wait. Did you say "sharing"
or "Sharon?"

13:42.793 --> 13:44.724
Sharing.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.482
-Who's Sharon?
-Sharon Stone, bitch.

13:47.482 --> 13:48.551
Who is that?

13:48.551 --> 13:49.724
Some famous white lady.

13:49.724 --> 13:52.137
Oh. That's a friend of yours?

13:52.137 --> 13:53.344
Girl, no.

13:55.310 --> 13:57.206
I feel like a Barbie doll
right now.

13:57.206 --> 13:59.172
You know, this is my favorite
thing to do, bitch.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.827
I'm gonna just take the hair
down and just feel good. Yes.

14:02.827 --> 14:06.379
I look over,
and Kerri has, like,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.103
four handkerchiefs
sewn together.

14:08.103 --> 14:10.586
You keep on modeling
that bolt of fabric

14:10.586 --> 14:11.758
wrapped around your waist, baby.

14:11.758 --> 14:13.413
Let me tell you
something, honey.

14:14.793 --> 14:18.862
And, like, any other girl
would be, like...

14:18.862 --> 14:21.206
But Miss Kerri's
just like, what?

14:23.068 --> 14:24.551
This is so good.

14:24.551 --> 14:26.655
Coming up...

14:26.655 --> 14:27.931
I thought this was
a real bug.

14:27.931 --> 14:28.965
-Oh, that is a real dragonfly.
-Oh, shit.

14:28.965 --> 14:30.448
A dragonfly?

14:30.448 --> 14:32.172
This dragonfly
about this damn long.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.551
If you eat the entire thing,

14:33.551 --> 14:34.793
I will give you $1,000.
I swear to you.

14:34.793 --> 14:36.172
-Okay, ready?
-Yes!

14:37.724 --> 14:41.000
Ah! Damn!

14:43.137 --> 14:46.413
Carry it, like, mm, mm.

14:46.413 --> 14:48.172
This challenge
is the closest I'm gonna get

14:48.172 --> 14:50.000
to getting married
anytime soon, bitch.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.103
Today we're doing a ball,
and in this challenge,

14:52.103 --> 14:54.310
what we have to make
is a whole bridal moment

14:54.310 --> 14:56.379
out of all kinds of fabric.

14:56.379 --> 14:58.379
There's a lot going on,
you guys.

14:58.379 --> 15:00.172
My problem I'm running into
right now

15:00.172 --> 15:02.137
is finding the white fabric.

15:02.137 --> 15:04.068
But I thought
this was a real bug.

15:04.068 --> 15:06.103
-Oh, that is a real dragonfly.
-Shit, are you fucking serious?

15:06.103 --> 15:07.827
No, that's real. Touch it.

15:07.827 --> 15:09.724
-No, I'm not touching that.
-I wanna see. What is it?

15:09.724 --> 15:10.724
Is that a dragonfly?

15:10.724 --> 15:13.137
A dragonfly?

15:13.137 --> 15:16.620
I saw the dragonfly whizzing
around earlier in the werkroom.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.068
Oh, that poor dragonfly.

15:18.068 --> 15:19.068
RIP.

15:19.068 --> 15:20.586
It's crunchy.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.620
This dragonfly
has not missed a meal.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.482
This dragonfly
about this damn long.

15:27.482 --> 15:31.413
So I'm just, like, Miss
Daya Bettica, let's be petty.

15:33.310 --> 15:34.482
I swear to God.

15:34.482 --> 15:35.758
-Oh!
-Are you serious?

15:35.758 --> 15:39.586
We shake on it.

15:39.586 --> 15:41.241
No way.
Okay seriously, though?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.379
If you eat the entire thing,
I will give you $1,000.

15:42.379 --> 15:43.896
I swear to you right now.

15:43.896 --> 15:47.137
For $1,000, eat the dragonfly?

15:47.137 --> 15:48.724
-Okay, ready?
-Yes!

15:54.758 --> 15:57.586
Oh, my God, that's so gross.

15:57.586 --> 15:59.517
It tastes like grass,
you guys.

15:59.517 --> 16:01.448
Yes!

16:01.448 --> 16:02.586
I can't believe
you just did that.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.275
I eat ass, you guys,
I can eat a bug.

16:09.896 --> 16:15.344
I sew about a third of my stuff,
maybe a quarter.

16:15.344 --> 16:17.482
A fifth. We'll say a fifth.

16:17.482 --> 16:22.000
Damn, this shit
requires your fucking fingers.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Sewing is honestly
kind of hard on my fingers.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.448
Oh, my God.

16:26.448 --> 16:29.275
And it's hard for me to use
my fine motor skills.

16:29.275 --> 16:30.413
If you've ever been out

16:30.413 --> 16:32.827
when it's, like,
negative 40 degrees,

16:32.827 --> 16:35.586
and then you go inside and
you try to lace up your shoes

16:35.586 --> 16:37.206
but your fingers
just won't do it?

16:37.206 --> 16:38.620
That's how I feel all the time.

16:38.620 --> 16:41.724
And so I am anxious
about finishing on time.

16:41.724 --> 16:43.793
Oh, shit.

16:43.793 --> 16:48.413
If I can just
get this...through.

16:48.413 --> 16:50.862
Kornbread, are you able to push
this safety pin through?

16:50.862 --> 16:52.379
Absolutely, babe.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.862
I'm only taking time
out of my time

16:53.862 --> 16:54.965
because it's you, Willow.

16:54.965 --> 16:56.206
-How your hands feeling?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.034
We gotta get you,
like, a cup of hot water.

17:01.034 --> 17:02.344
Oh, yeah.

17:02.344 --> 17:03.896
Will holding it make it
better for you? Okay.

17:03.896 --> 17:05.413
That way you can
warm your hands up,

17:05.413 --> 17:06.517
because I know
they bother you a lot.

17:06.517 --> 17:08.379
Yeah.

17:08.379 --> 17:09.896
Oh, it's just getting to me.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.655
Just take a deep breath.
You got it, baby.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.482
Don't overwork yourself.

17:13.482 --> 17:15.586
I don't think the girls
in the werkroom

17:15.586 --> 17:18.068
know the extent
of Willow's issues,

17:18.068 --> 17:19.413
because they don't talk
to Willow

17:19.413 --> 17:21.034
as much as I talk to Willow.

17:21.034 --> 17:23.137
I don't think Willow
is telling them,

17:23.137 --> 17:25.965
because Willow
does not complain.

17:25.965 --> 17:27.965
Willow is gonna get
the job done regardless.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.241
Grab your cup.
I got it.

17:29.241 --> 17:31.724
Focus on getting
your hands better.

17:31.724 --> 17:35.000
I love my girl Kornbread.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.068
I didn't think I would get
so close to someone

17:38.068 --> 17:39.689
so early in this competition.

17:39.689 --> 17:42.724
She makes me feel stable
and at home.

17:42.724 --> 17:43.896
Thank you.

17:50.758 --> 17:53.000
This thread
is doing the most.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.724
-Wedding gowns are not my thing,

17:54.724 --> 17:56.862
so I'm just like, hmm,

17:56.862 --> 17:59.379
I'm gonna make this,
like, my wedding gown.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.931
If Jorgeous is gonna
get married, girl,

18:00.931 --> 18:03.344
she's gonna be wearing something
sickening, very sexy, you know.

18:03.344 --> 18:04.931
So, yeah, I could put
a ring on it.

18:04.931 --> 18:08.448
Jorgeous, are you doing, like,
a Puerto Rican, like, storyline?

18:08.448 --> 18:10.137
No.

18:10.137 --> 18:11.896
-No?
-I'm not, no.

18:11.896 --> 18:14.482
Bitch, that's
exactly kind of--no?

18:14.482 --> 18:15.862
I'm not even Puerto Rican.

18:15.862 --> 18:19.034
Who cares? Represent
someone else's ethnicity.

18:23.862 --> 18:26.448
-Daya, how's it going?
-Good.

18:26.448 --> 18:28.896
Ooh, you look like you got
a lot of detailing going on.

18:28.896 --> 18:30.551
A lot of ruffles.

18:30.551 --> 18:32.448
I'm going more
in the route of, like,

18:32.448 --> 18:35.655
a bridesmaid in the late
eighties, early nineties,

18:35.655 --> 18:38.275
because I feel like that's
gonna show more of Daya Betty

18:38.275 --> 18:40.482
and hopefully
less Crystal Methyd.

18:40.482 --> 18:42.000
Miss Daya Bettica.

18:43.379 --> 18:45.793
No, I'm kidding.

18:45.793 --> 18:47.724
-Daya Bettica.
-Daya Bettica.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.344
She sounds like
she's from Players Club.

18:49.344 --> 18:51.758
-Daya Bettica.
-Daya Bettica.

18:51.758 --> 18:53.965
Daya Becca, or what was it?

18:53.965 --> 18:55.310
Daya Bettica.
That's not your name?

18:55.310 --> 18:56.310
Daya Bettica.

18:56.310 --> 18:59.000
Her name not Daya Bettica?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.724
I swear for Eminem,

19:03.724 --> 19:06.172
I have been screaming "Daya
Bettica" at this girl all day.

19:06.172 --> 19:08.241
I don't hate the name.

19:08.241 --> 19:10.586
Her name Daya Betty, bitch.
I did not know that.

19:10.586 --> 19:12.827
Daya Betty.
Daya Bettica.

19:15.448 --> 19:17.413
It's honestly, like,
I was really worried

19:17.413 --> 19:18.620
until I got, like,
all this together.

19:18.620 --> 19:19.793
It's not, like,
what I want it to be,

19:19.793 --> 19:21.068
but I think
it'll be really cute.

19:21.068 --> 19:22.034
You're going, like,
All-America wedding?

19:22.034 --> 19:23.620
-Mm-hmm.
-I love that.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.413
Good old Arkansas wedding.

19:25.413 --> 19:28.137
Arkansas American girl.

19:28.137 --> 19:29.379
For my inspiration
for the bridal challenge,

19:29.379 --> 19:30.758
I really wanted to have

19:30.758 --> 19:33.689
just a good, old-fashioned,
American wedding.

19:33.689 --> 19:35.827
USA, USA!

19:37.103 --> 19:39.379
Maddy's look,
although it's sewed well,

19:39.379 --> 19:42.758
it just looks
very Colonel Sanders.

19:42.758 --> 19:46.310
Oh, she looks so pretty.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.620
Like she getting married
in Kentucky.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.724
Coming up...

19:52.724 --> 19:54.310
Welcome back.

19:54.310 --> 19:56.965
I am ready to prove to these
bitches why I'm still here.

19:56.965 --> 19:58.965
So Imma give it to you
true tea.

19:58.965 --> 20:02.413
I was not very excited
to have you back.

20:11.482 --> 20:13.379
It's ball day, bitches!

20:13.379 --> 20:14.862
-Ball day!
-Whoo, whoo!

20:14.862 --> 20:16.724
It is a new day
in the werkroom.

20:16.724 --> 20:18.931
I've always wanted to say
that on RuPaul's Drag Race!

20:20.241 --> 20:21.724
-I love balls!
-Whoo!

20:21.724 --> 20:23.620
I love balls, too, bitch!

20:23.620 --> 20:25.827
And now it's time
to get ready for the ball.

20:25.827 --> 20:28.620
I'm excited to see
what the judges think

20:28.620 --> 20:30.137
about my little dress.

20:30.137 --> 20:31.448
Let's hope it's enough.

20:31.448 --> 20:32.620
Welcome back.

20:32.620 --> 20:35.482
So Imma give it to you
true tea.

20:35.482 --> 20:38.034
I was not very excited
to have you back.

20:39.413 --> 20:41.379
But...

20:41.379 --> 20:43.241
I'm happy you're back.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.344
Why were you happy?

20:45.344 --> 20:47.655
But the first lip sync
is so stressful.

20:47.655 --> 20:49.172
Oh, my God, I just won
my first lip sync.

20:49.172 --> 20:52.448
I was, like, not really,
because here she is.

20:52.448 --> 20:53.931
So I was like--
in my mind, I was, like,

20:53.931 --> 20:55.517
she didn't
get to show shit,

20:55.517 --> 20:57.172
so it's very deserving
that you're back.

20:57.172 --> 21:01.517
And I love you,
and welcome back.

21:01.517 --> 21:03.172
I can't wait
to send you home again.

21:03.172 --> 21:04.793
-Right.

21:04.793 --> 21:07.103
I started off kind of rocky,

21:07.103 --> 21:09.517
but I am ready to just
come back full force

21:09.517 --> 21:12.896
and really get to prove to these
bitches why I'm still here.

21:15.137 --> 21:17.724
-How are you feeling today?
-I'm feeling good.

21:17.724 --> 21:19.724
I am feeling a lot better.

21:19.724 --> 21:21.965
What's your signature style?

21:21.965 --> 21:26.275
It's very draggy,
like very over-draggy,

21:26.275 --> 21:28.551
very pageant,
old-school pageant.

21:28.551 --> 21:31.758
I kind of love Angeria's
Southern accent.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.862
I don't know. It just feels
like some sort of Southern--

21:34.862 --> 21:37.620
or, like, a Western movie
or something, you know?

21:37.620 --> 21:40.448
Big, coiffed, wavy hair, and--

21:40.448 --> 21:43.103
-Yeah. Yeah!
-What is your--oh!

21:44.827 --> 21:46.206
Girl.

21:46.206 --> 21:48.896
So, Willow, what is your style?

21:48.896 --> 21:51.965
She's always very cutesy,
a little bit creepy.

21:51.965 --> 21:53.896
Yeah!

21:53.896 --> 21:58.724
You gonna make me knock you
right on up outta this chair.

21:58.724 --> 22:00.620
If you say one more thing,

22:00.620 --> 22:03.620
Imma knock you all
the way back to Camdentown.

22:03.620 --> 22:06.965
Say it.

22:06.965 --> 22:10.275
Keep fucking with me,
you gonna be nauseous forever.

22:10.275 --> 22:13.034
Lady Camden
is probably the one girl

22:13.034 --> 22:15.379
that I am the most fond of.

22:15.379 --> 22:16.896
Now, get yo ass up
and get back in the chair.

22:16.896 --> 22:18.482
I could definitely
see me and her,

22:18.482 --> 22:21.068
like, hanging out after this.

22:21.068 --> 22:22.586
Yeah!

22:26.517 --> 22:28.206
My mom, I feel like
she was, like,

22:28.206 --> 22:29.724
the one person I had in my life.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.344
Are your parents supportive
of what you guys do, or--

22:32.344 --> 22:33.517
Well, my mom was.

22:33.517 --> 22:35.896
Yeah, she passed away
a few years ago.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.034
What happened with your mom?

22:38.034 --> 22:39.758
She actually killed herself.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.241
Oh, my God.

22:41.241 --> 22:42.344
Yeah.

22:42.344 --> 22:45.482
My mom was going through

22:45.482 --> 22:50.275
a lot of mental issues
with bipolar depression.

22:50.275 --> 22:53.482
She overdosed, and it took me
a while to process it,

22:53.482 --> 22:56.103
because my mom and I
were super close.

22:56.103 --> 22:57.620
Actually, the reason
I started doing drag,

22:57.620 --> 22:59.482
because I, like--we used
to watch Drag Racetogether,

22:59.482 --> 23:01.000
and she was always, like,

23:01.000 --> 23:02.413
"I wanna see you on there,
I wanna see you doing that."

23:02.413 --> 23:04.965
A few years later, like,
I started doing drag

23:04.965 --> 23:06.551
because I feel like it was a way

23:06.551 --> 23:08.793
for me to, like, feel close
with my mom again, you know?

23:08.793 --> 23:09.931
She never saw you in drag,
right? She never--

23:09.931 --> 23:11.206
No.

23:11.206 --> 23:13.586
I mean, she's seeing you
right now do it, bitch.

23:13.586 --> 23:15.655
Yeah, and that's why I'm, like,
tonight is definitely, like,

23:15.655 --> 23:17.379
a way for me
to pay homage to her,

23:17.379 --> 23:20.275
because I based my look
that I made, like--

23:20.275 --> 23:21.758
-Off of her?
-Off of her, yeah.

23:21.758 --> 23:24.724
My mom has definitely influenced

23:24.724 --> 23:26.206
everything that I am doing
right now,

23:26.206 --> 23:29.620
and I am here to make her proud.

23:29.620 --> 23:31.379
You know what? Even if
I don't win this challenge,

23:31.379 --> 23:33.344
like, I'm still
really proud of what I did,

23:33.344 --> 23:34.344
and I'm really happy.

23:34.344 --> 23:35.827
We love you, bitch.

23:35.827 --> 23:37.551
Even though we just met you
the other day, bitch,

23:37.551 --> 23:38.827
we love you.

23:38.827 --> 23:41.310
I know, I'm still
learning all your names.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.379
As y'all know, I was put out
very early from my parents.

23:47.379 --> 23:49.931
I was never the child
that they wanted me to be.

23:49.931 --> 23:52.206
I always knew
that I was different.

23:52.206 --> 23:54.724
I always felt a very
feminine energy about me.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.344
Like, I would have been
one of those kids

23:56.344 --> 23:58.137
if I did have
a supporting family,

23:58.137 --> 23:59.689
where I would have been,
like, eight years old,

23:59.689 --> 24:02.517
telling my family, like, I don't
feel comfortable as a boy.

24:02.517 --> 24:05.620
I don't feel like my gender
matches who I am on the inside.

24:05.620 --> 24:07.344
I most definitely did not have

24:07.344 --> 24:09.310
that type
of a supporting system.

24:09.310 --> 24:11.827
It got to be where I literally
just told my parents, "I'll go."

24:11.827 --> 24:13.379
And they were, like, "Good.

24:13.379 --> 24:15.896
You know, we disown you,
we rebuke you."

24:15.896 --> 24:20.310
When did that separation
of coming into your own happen?

24:20.310 --> 24:22.068
When did your adulthood hit you?

24:22.068 --> 24:29.448
I left--I moved out of my house
in high school.

24:29.448 --> 24:31.689
You left during high school?

24:31.689 --> 24:35.758
Yeah, because I didn't feel
comfortable where I was.

24:35.758 --> 24:38.241
Um...

24:40.344 --> 24:42.931
This conversation
is just triggering me

24:42.931 --> 24:45.137
at this moment in time.

24:45.137 --> 24:47.000
-Imma go outside.
-Are you okay, sister?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.551
I'm gonna sit outside
for a minute.

24:48.551 --> 24:51.068
-Oh, bitch, I'm so sorry.
-Sorry.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.724
In this moment in time,

25:01.724 --> 25:04.448
I'm discovering that things
that I thought I was over,

25:04.448 --> 25:06.103
I'm not really over.

25:06.103 --> 25:08.931
Ugh. Can I go with her, or--

25:08.931 --> 25:11.137
I would say she's
gonna want her own moment

25:11.137 --> 25:12.448
to just kind of
get her bearings.

25:13.896 --> 25:17.206
Growing up, I had my moments
of extreme flamboyancy,

25:17.206 --> 25:19.413
and my mom,
she would not like it,

25:19.413 --> 25:22.034
and she would state
that she did not like it.

25:22.034 --> 25:25.517
It's hard to, like,
find an acceptance,

25:25.517 --> 25:27.517
and I just...

25:30.827 --> 25:34.448
I felt like such a
disappointment for a long time.

25:34.448 --> 25:37.689
I thought I was a mistake.

25:37.689 --> 25:40.172
I would just literally
sometimes go to sleep

25:40.172 --> 25:42.586
so disappointed in myself,

25:42.586 --> 25:46.000
and I would just pray
that I didn't wake up.

25:47.517 --> 25:50.344
When I was around 16 years old,

25:50.344 --> 25:53.965
I was like, okay, tomorrow,
I'm just gonna leave.

25:53.965 --> 25:57.172
I ended up moving in
with one of my city friends,

25:57.172 --> 26:01.896
and they didn't--

26:01.896 --> 26:05.137
my family didn't look for me,

26:05.137 --> 26:06.793
and I was literally
around the corner.

26:06.793 --> 26:07.965
You good, sis?

26:07.965 --> 26:09.586
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

26:09.586 --> 26:12.551
Should we just focus
on painting?

26:12.551 --> 26:15.586
-Let's do that.

26:15.586 --> 26:17.068
Pblblblt.

26:17.068 --> 26:19.413
It's just talking
about, like, family stuff,

26:19.413 --> 26:21.448
and it's, like,
I never realized

26:21.448 --> 26:24.620
how much I just
pushed everything back.

26:24.620 --> 26:25.862
Right now, this present day,

26:25.862 --> 26:27.517
I'm in a phenomenal place
with my family.

26:27.517 --> 26:31.034
But I realize there's
some shit I gotta deal with.

26:31.034 --> 26:33.620
So I am gonna talk to them
as soon as I get home.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.724
But, girl, pull it together.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.931
Right now it's time
to get ready for the runway.

27:01.241 --> 27:02.620
-Whoo!

27:02.620 --> 27:04.310
Black Cat Phoenix.

27:04.310 --> 27:07.068
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

27:07.068 --> 27:09.172
Michelle Visage,

27:09.172 --> 27:11.310
are you ready
for a pair of balls?

27:11.310 --> 27:15.758
Aah! I love to play with balls!

27:15.758 --> 27:18.206
Style superstar Carson Kressley.

27:18.206 --> 27:21.379
Now, have you ever met a pair
of balls you didn't like?

27:21.379 --> 27:23.827
Oh, the only kind I don't like
are foul balls.

27:23.827 --> 27:25.000
The worst.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I didn't know
you were into baseball.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.413
Base what?

27:30.551 --> 27:34.724
And our extra-special guest
judge, Christine Chiu.

27:34.724 --> 27:37.137
Welcome to our Bling Fempire.

27:37.137 --> 27:39.000
Thank you so much for having me.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.655
I'm honored to be here
and blingy with joy.

27:42.655 --> 27:45.241
Ooh, and that's
just below the deck.

27:47.137 --> 27:49.137
This week, we challenged
each of our queens

27:49.137 --> 27:52.413
to serve three looks
in a pair of balls,

27:52.413 --> 27:55.827
and now they're just itchin'
to hit the runway.

27:56.931 --> 27:59.068
Racers, start your engines,

27:59.068 --> 28:01.793
and may the best drag queen win.

28:01.793 --> 28:03.517
Coming up...

28:03.517 --> 28:05.758
Rrr.

28:05.758 --> 28:08.620
Aah!

28:08.620 --> 28:11.517
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

28:11.517 --> 28:13.758
Ooh, my coffee enema
is kicking in.

28:19.172 --> 28:23.862
Welcome, children,
to the Hide 'n Chic Ball.

28:23.862 --> 28:28.551
Category is Zebra Print Resort.

28:28.551 --> 28:31.827
Up first, Alyssa Hunter.

28:31.827 --> 28:33.689
She's putting the "tuck"
in "Kentucky Derby."

28:33.689 --> 28:35.551
Oh, okay.

28:35.551 --> 28:38.103
My look is inspired
by the movieRacing Stripes,

28:38.103 --> 28:39.482
about this cute little zebra.

28:39.482 --> 28:42.413
I'm ready for a race, bitches.

28:42.413 --> 28:43.586
Christine:
Very Jockey Onassis.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.172
Bosco.

28:47.172 --> 28:48.758
It's a zebracorn.

28:48.758 --> 28:50.310
It's a zebracorn.

28:50.310 --> 28:51.724
When did I have zebracorn?

28:51.724 --> 28:55.724
My look
is the aprÃ¨s-ski on Mars

28:55.724 --> 28:57.344
zebra print fantasy.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.793
I'm gonna get loaded,

28:58.793 --> 29:02.000
and then go pass out
after skiing all day.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.172
I feel awesome.

29:05.172 --> 29:06.862
Well, I guess
the Statute of Liberty

29:06.862 --> 29:07.896
really is in New Jersey.

29:07.896 --> 29:09.551
There ya go.

29:09.551 --> 29:11.206
Willow Pill.

29:11.206 --> 29:13.655
Someone has a power
lunch at Animal Kingdom.

29:15.206 --> 29:17.862
I love to do
pedestrian looks,

29:17.862 --> 29:19.241
because you can really infuse,

29:19.241 --> 29:21.448
like, a real-life character
into them.

29:21.448 --> 29:23.068
She's just wigglin'
and squigglin'

29:23.068 --> 29:24.896
'cause she's got so much ass.

29:24.896 --> 29:28.586
I own 51% of this zoo.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.793
Kerri Colby.

29:31.793 --> 29:34.241
Oh, of course, you know,
she's got a case of pinkleg.

29:34.241 --> 29:38.275
This dress is kind of
taking me to nineties energy.

29:38.275 --> 29:40.241
It's very light and airy.

29:40.241 --> 29:41.586
There's always a good bounce.

29:41.586 --> 29:43.344
Show 'em the hair,
show 'em the face,

29:43.344 --> 29:45.689
give them so much to eat up

29:45.689 --> 29:47.034
that they're just
obsessed with you.

29:47.034 --> 29:49.793
Carson:
You better flamin-go, girl.

29:51.034 --> 29:52.965
Kornbread with a "K."

29:52.965 --> 29:55.655
Canteen dreams
and Kornbread wishes.

29:57.620 --> 29:58.965
I decided to go

29:58.965 --> 30:01.241
straight
to the safari resort, honey.

30:01.241 --> 30:04.379
So I feel like I hit
the nail on the hammer.

30:04.379 --> 30:06.275
The hammer on the nail.
The nail on the board.

30:06.275 --> 30:09.655
Baby, I'm walking
into this safari

30:09.655 --> 30:11.241
with my canteen first.

30:11.241 --> 30:12.793
And y'all think it's water,

30:12.793 --> 30:15.000
but it's a little bit
of that good juice up in here.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.862
Bottoms up!

30:18.103 --> 30:20.344
RuPaul; Orion Story.

30:20.344 --> 30:23.241
I hear she's got a hole in one.

30:23.241 --> 30:27.275
I am giving you
the fullHeathers fantasy.

30:27.275 --> 30:30.344
Bitchy popular girl
who doesn't wanna be there.

30:30.344 --> 30:32.379
She's never golfed
a day in her life.

30:32.379 --> 30:34.103
And this is what
Orion would wear

30:34.103 --> 30:36.000
if she was on
a golf resort trip.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.241
RuPaul:
Ooh, check out her back nine.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.137
June
is busting out all over!

30:42.137 --> 30:44.310
Michelle:
From the boardroom to the clerb.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.758
Is the bus still running?

30:45.758 --> 30:49.482
June don't know,
because she has a driver.

30:49.482 --> 30:52.862
I am giving you old
Hollywood royalty right now.

30:52.862 --> 30:55.206
This is not off the rack
or around the corner.

30:55.206 --> 30:56.620
I'm definitely giving you
rich bitch.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.620
RuPaul:

31:10.448 --> 31:13.620
Up first, Daya Betty.

31:13.620 --> 31:15.689

31:17.310 --> 31:19.000
I have
this fun babydoll dress,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.965
and I feel
my two little pigtails

31:20.965 --> 31:22.793
flip-flopping in the wind.

31:22.793 --> 31:28.275
I feel like the weirdest child
at the amusement park.

31:28.275 --> 31:29.689
There's a sucker born
every minute.

31:31.379 --> 31:33.068
Angeria.

31:33.068 --> 31:35.862
Michelle:
The crimson tide has come in.

31:35.862 --> 31:39.310
I'm giving you
sixties babydoll dress,

31:39.310 --> 31:41.758
dragged up
to the tenth power, baby.

31:41.758 --> 31:44.000
Everybody wanna be
at the resort I'm at.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.862
Christine:
She's red for filth.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.551
DeJa Skye.

31:49.551 --> 31:51.172
You flow, girl.

31:51.172 --> 31:53.620
Who says you can't wear
floor-length dresses

31:53.620 --> 31:54.655
during the day?

31:54.655 --> 31:57.241
I am feeling airy and light.

31:57.241 --> 32:00.689
Some flowy chiffon
against my boobicles.

32:00.689 --> 32:03.655
I am floating on this runway.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.206
Michelle:
Flouncin' and behavin'.

32:05.206 --> 32:06.206
Yes.

32:06.206 --> 32:08.034
Jasmine Kennedie.

32:08.034 --> 32:10.137
Michelle:
They call her a U.S. ho.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.448
I am walking out
in my 1950s

32:12.448 --> 32:15.241
pin-up girl style
resort wear look,

32:15.241 --> 32:18.137
and then I pull out
my lobster claws,

32:18.137 --> 32:21.310
because I wanna show them that
I can be a little bit campy.

32:21.310 --> 32:23.862
I'm serving them
crustacean chic.

32:23.862 --> 32:25.172
Well, there was
a clause in her contract.

32:25.172 --> 32:26.379
There was a clause
in her contract.

32:26.379 --> 32:27.758
That she had to wear this.

32:27.758 --> 32:29.655
Jorgeous.

32:29.655 --> 32:32.103
Call her Miss Ross.

32:32.103 --> 32:34.172
Bitch,
I'm giving you hot Miami girl

32:34.172 --> 32:35.413
walking down the street.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.310
Jorgeous is all about the body.

32:37.310 --> 32:38.793
It's so hot in here,

32:38.793 --> 32:42.379
and I want the judges
to see how hot I am.

32:42.379 --> 32:43.551
Disco inferno.

32:43.551 --> 32:44.931
Yeah.

32:44.931 --> 32:46.068
Lady Camden.

32:46.068 --> 32:47.724
Carson:
I saw her in "Gypsy" once.

32:47.724 --> 32:50.827
Michelle:
What's my fortune?

32:50.827 --> 32:52.310
Lady Camden:
For red hot resort wear,

32:52.310 --> 32:54.000
I wanted to show something
with a bit of body

32:54.000 --> 32:55.379
and a bit of sass.

32:55.379 --> 32:56.931
Oh, I've been to this resort
so many times.

32:56.931 --> 32:59.275
Like, I have a membership here,
they know my drink.

32:59.275 --> 33:01.206
They just give it to me
as soon as I walk in.

33:01.206 --> 33:04.793
She is Posh Spice on vacation.
Can't be bothered.

33:04.793 --> 33:08.827
Nothing beats
a great pair of legs, kids.

33:08.827 --> 33:10.241
Maddy Morphosis.

33:10.241 --> 33:13.206
I think she got this
at PalazzoPants.com.

33:13.206 --> 33:14.689
Aha.

33:14.689 --> 33:16.551
I have this full outfit

33:16.551 --> 33:19.034
with matching headband
and little purse.

33:19.034 --> 33:20.862
I am trying to give
the judges playful.

33:20.862 --> 33:22.137
I am really proud of this look.

33:22.137 --> 33:23.413
It was one of
the very first outfits

33:23.413 --> 33:25.551
I ever created from scratch.

33:25.551 --> 33:28.517
Call 911.
We've got a jumper here.

33:30.413 --> 33:32.586

Evening Wear.

33:40.827 --> 33:44.758
Up first, Alyssa Hunter.

33:44.758 --> 33:47.206
She is ready
to make your bed rock.

33:47.206 --> 33:49.551
Ever wonder
what happened to Bam-Bam?

33:51.068 --> 33:53.862
I'm just serving these
Miranda Priestly vibes,

33:53.862 --> 33:55.931
and it's inspired
by Thierry Mugler.

33:55.931 --> 33:57.034
Very fashion.

33:57.034 --> 33:58.689
I feel like a bitch right now.

33:58.689 --> 34:01.448
Miss Hunter
becomes the hunted.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.068
Bosco.

34:05.068 --> 34:07.000
Meow! Cat got your top?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.862
I love leopard print.

34:09.862 --> 34:12.551
I'm giving you formal culottes,

34:12.551 --> 34:14.379
which I don't think
we get enough of.

34:14.379 --> 34:18.034
Ru, why can't cats
play poker in the jungle?

34:18.034 --> 34:21.206
Too many cheetahs!

34:21.206 --> 34:23.034
Willow Pill.

34:23.034 --> 34:25.034
Carson:
Marisa Tomei, you stay.

34:25.034 --> 34:27.344
I chose
black-on-black leopard,

34:27.344 --> 34:30.068
because I know that no one else
was gonna choose this.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.931
This girl, she's--

34:32.931 --> 34:34.586
How do I saya coked-out
nineties model

34:34.586 --> 34:35.758
without saying coked-out?

34:35.758 --> 34:38.275
She knows she's hot,

34:38.275 --> 34:40.689
and she's got, like,
14 Italian boyfriends.

34:40.689 --> 34:43.275
Gypsy Wose Wee.

34:45.241 --> 34:46.275
Kerri Colby.

34:46.275 --> 34:49.793
Ooh, you're a spinner, baby.

34:49.793 --> 34:52.689
I feelDynasty down.

34:52.689 --> 34:54.206
You might think
this is a breastplate,

34:54.206 --> 34:57.172
but these are actually
my own home-grown tatas.

34:57.172 --> 34:58.896
I feel like I actually own

34:58.896 --> 35:01.827
a good percentage of the whole
RuPaul's Drag Race franchise.

35:01.827 --> 35:04.172
This reminds me
of my favorite TV show.

35:04.172 --> 35:05.724
-What's that?
-Leopardy.

35:07.793 --> 35:09.000
RuPaul:
Kornbread with a "K."

35:09.000 --> 35:11.034
Carson:
Come up and see me, feline.

35:12.620 --> 35:15.068
I'm giving you
my little dazzler. Rawr.

35:15.068 --> 35:18.551
Bitch, you know the claws

realness, honey.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.000
RuPaul:

35:27.620 --> 35:28.827
Orion Story.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.931
She's got quite
the mouth on her...head.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.034
-Oh!
-Whoa!

35:36.034 --> 35:38.862
I'm giving you
the fill Xena warrior fantasy.

35:38.862 --> 35:43.068
This look is definitely me,
because I love to show my body.

35:43.068 --> 35:45.586
I am giving the judges
just pure sex.

35:45.586 --> 35:49.241
Looking good
and feline gorgeous.

35:50.241 --> 35:51.793
June Jambalaya.

35:51.793 --> 35:54.275
Totally lamÃ©-zing.

35:54.275 --> 35:55.862
I knew with evening wear

35:55.862 --> 35:58.413
that I wanted something
really flowy.

35:58.413 --> 36:01.137
I wanted to be like
theSex and the City movies,

36:01.137 --> 36:03.551
when they're traveling and
it's always garments and things

36:03.551 --> 36:04.689
just flying everywhere.

36:04.689 --> 36:06.379
I'm proud of it.

36:06.379 --> 36:09.517
I can't walk in it,
but I'm proud of it.

36:09.517 --> 36:12.034
They're sending her
to the leopard colony.

36:14.689 --> 36:17.724
Category is Evening Wear:

36:17.724 --> 36:19.000
Why It Gotta Be White?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.586
Up first, Daya Betty.

36:21.586 --> 36:24.655
I think she has
a trick up her sleeve.

36:24.655 --> 36:26.655
When I think
of evening wear,

36:26.655 --> 36:30.482
I think of being at home
in a robe,

36:30.482 --> 36:32.793
eating food,
and getting ready for bed.

36:32.793 --> 36:34.965
So how can I translate that

36:34.965 --> 36:38.586
into something drag
and something sexy?

36:38.586 --> 36:41.896
Harlow, Jean
on the cover of a magazine.

36:41.896 --> 36:43.137
Angeria.

36:43.137 --> 36:45.758
It is the disco
Reverend Angie.

36:45.758 --> 36:48.586
Yes, honey.
I am ready for my baptism.

36:48.586 --> 36:50.758
Oh, it's a jumpsuit!

36:50.758 --> 36:52.310
Thought it was a dress,
didn't you?

36:52.310 --> 36:56.482
Oh, yeah, I have on
my long, white nails, honey,

36:56.482 --> 36:58.275
and I look fabulous.

36:58.275 --> 37:01.000
Michelle:
Take that, Little Richard.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.965
Yes!

37:02.965 --> 37:04.655
DeJa Skye.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.000
You heard about
the Heart of the Ocean, right?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.275
Uh-huh.

37:07.275 --> 37:09.034
She's wearing
the Heart of Sylmar.

37:09.034 --> 37:13.724
I am in love
with the wide-legged pants.

37:13.724 --> 37:18.758
I am hands on waist,
delivering this look.

37:18.758 --> 37:20.758
RuPaul:
DeJa Skye's new fragrance:

37:20.758 --> 37:22.344
White Shoulderpads.

37:24.137 --> 37:25.551
Jasmine Kennedie.

37:25.551 --> 37:28.413
Ladies and gentlemen,
Juliet Prowse.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.034
Uh-huh.

37:30.034 --> 37:32.551
I have this beautiful,
beautiful cocktail dress

37:32.551 --> 37:34.137
made by my drag mother.

37:34.137 --> 37:37.724
I'm feeling delectable,
so glitterific.

37:37.724 --> 37:39.793
This is everything
I wanna serve on the runway.

37:39.793 --> 37:41.482
RuPaul:
Mm, shake that tail feather.

37:43.689 --> 37:45.206
Jorgeous.

37:45.206 --> 37:48.068
Oh, this skirt
was 25% off.

37:48.068 --> 37:51.137
Jorgeous:
I'm giving you elegance, bitch.

37:51.137 --> 37:54.103
So chic, and it's not
doing too much,

37:54.103 --> 37:55.758
like how some of these
other girls are doing.

37:55.758 --> 37:58.827
It is clean and it's
getting the point across.

37:58.827 --> 38:01.448
Putting the "bow"
back in "elbow."

38:01.448 --> 38:02.586
Exactly.

38:02.586 --> 38:05.103
Lady Camden.

38:05.103 --> 38:06.517
Michelle:
Wrap it up. I'll take two.

38:06.517 --> 38:07.758
Lady Camden:
I like to play with wire

38:07.758 --> 38:10.931
and do stuff
that's a little bit 3D

38:10.931 --> 38:12.379
and a little bit
more architectural.

38:12.379 --> 38:14.517
It's still glamorous
and it's still pretty,

38:14.517 --> 38:17.448
but it's wrapped up
in a cartoon bow,

38:17.448 --> 38:19.344
and ready to be unwrapped.

38:19.344 --> 38:22.000
RuPaul:
Ooh, la isla bow-ista.

38:23.724 --> 38:25.379
Maddy Morphosis.

38:25.379 --> 38:28.862
Michelle:
I believe she's mooning us.

38:28.862 --> 38:32.068
I am giving you
a 180-degree turn

38:32.068 --> 38:34.000
from my previous look.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.379
It feels very theatrical,

38:35.379 --> 38:37.206
and it does not get
any more nighttime

38:37.206 --> 38:38.758
than the moon and the stars.

38:38.758 --> 38:42.586
That's what you call
a celestial body-ody-ody.

38:45.482 --> 38:46.862
Coming up...

38:46.862 --> 38:47.862
I loved it.

38:47.862 --> 38:49.379
This is the show stopper for me.

38:49.379 --> 38:52.275
I'm getting Evel Knievel
evening wear eleganza.

39:02.827 --> 39:07.068
Category is Animal Print
Bridal Couture.

39:07.068 --> 39:10.482
First up, Alyssa Hunter.

39:10.482 --> 39:13.448
I hear the bride's
a real gold digger.

39:14.862 --> 39:16.758
I am wearing
this romantic dress,

39:16.758 --> 39:18.482
but with a jungle touch.

39:18.482 --> 39:22.206
I'm feeling the Jane fantasy,
ready to marry my Tarzan.

39:22.206 --> 39:25.379
Baby, this is how
you do couture.

39:25.379 --> 39:26.620
Carson:
We've heard of the Tiger King.

39:26.620 --> 39:27.965
This is the Tiger Queen.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.034
Michelle:
Take that, Carole Baskin.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.310
Bosco.

39:31.310 --> 39:33.862
Siegfried & Roy
for David's Bridal.

39:35.551 --> 39:37.000
My bridal look

39:37.000 --> 39:39.896
is very Cruella de Vil's
big wedding

39:39.896 --> 39:43.620
that's being protested
by PETA across the street.

39:43.620 --> 39:45.758
The only reason
why Bosco would ever marry

39:45.758 --> 39:49.482
is to get into that will,
kill him off, and continue on.

39:49.482 --> 39:51.620
I laughed, I cried,
it was better than Cats.

39:51.620 --> 39:54.310
I'm gonna see it
two more times.

39:54.310 --> 39:55.586
Said no one of Cats.

39:55.586 --> 39:58.034
Willow Pill.

39:58.034 --> 40:02.172
I think we can see who's gonna
wear the pants in this marriage.

40:02.172 --> 40:04.551
This bridal look
has everything.

40:04.551 --> 40:06.620
We've got Studio 54,

40:06.620 --> 40:08.793
we've got corporate
lesbian rich wedding,

40:08.793 --> 40:10.827
a jungle theme to it as well.

40:10.827 --> 40:12.172
I don't know what's happening,

40:12.172 --> 40:14.551
but I look like
a hot rocker bride,

40:14.551 --> 40:16.000
and I love it.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.586
I don't care about
whoever I'm marrying,

40:17.586 --> 40:19.448
whoever this hot woman or man

40:19.448 --> 40:21.689
or nonspecific gender
person is.

40:21.689 --> 40:23.379
I'm just here to look hot.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.689
Christine:
Meow and forever.

40:25.689 --> 40:26.827
Auntie Mane.

40:26.827 --> 40:30.206
Kerri Colby.

40:30.206 --> 40:33.275
You call it a bouquet.
I call it a bou-kurr.

40:35.655 --> 40:36.793
Michelle:
Y'all didn't tell me

40:36.793 --> 40:39.827
Raquel Welch
was in this competition.

40:39.827 --> 40:41.448
As I'm walking
down the runway,

40:41.448 --> 40:44.517
I give that model essence
tran-tasy, darling.

40:44.517 --> 40:46.827
As I'm taking
a little expensive look

40:46.827 --> 40:49.310
at the expensive
Christine Chiu,

40:49.310 --> 40:53.103
I feel like I am creating
a $20,000 fantasy.

40:53.103 --> 40:54.448
Oh, she's definitely
getting married.

40:54.448 --> 40:56.344
She's wearing an I Do-rag.

40:57.724 --> 40:59.379
RuPaul:
Kornbread with a "K."

40:59.379 --> 41:02.896
Get these
motherfucking snakes

41:02.896 --> 41:06.482
off this motherfucking plane.

41:06.482 --> 41:10.241
I'm feeling my
serpent-snake fantasy, baby.

41:10.241 --> 41:11.862
And I popped these big eyes,

41:11.862 --> 41:13.827
and I started to give him
the snake talk.

41:13.827 --> 41:16.275
You know how that snake
be tasting up everything.

41:16.275 --> 41:18.344
I am married to the sin, baby.

41:18.344 --> 41:20.689
Call me Eve, bitch.

41:20.689 --> 41:23.551
On second thought,
her anaconda do.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.379
Orion Story.

41:28.379 --> 41:30.896
I see a young Morgan Fairchild.

41:30.896 --> 41:32.517
Oh, yes.

41:32.517 --> 41:34.862
Tonight, I wanted
to pay a homage to my mom,

41:34.862 --> 41:36.448
because she always reminded me

41:36.448 --> 41:39.172
of those characters
like Fran Drescher,

41:39.172 --> 41:41.172
who just had, like,
the beautiful hair,

41:41.172 --> 41:43.275
like, always dressed sexy.

41:43.275 --> 41:46.965
I am giving you what Peg Bundy
would wear to her wedding

41:46.965 --> 41:48.448
if she was inThe Flintstones.

41:48.448 --> 41:50.068
Carson:
But where is Orion's belt?

41:50.068 --> 41:52.896
I can never find that one.

41:52.896 --> 41:54.758
June.

41:54.758 --> 41:56.137
You know, I love it

41:56.137 --> 41:57.413
when they let you
take the centerpiece home.

41:58.862 --> 42:01.379
And you get a frond
and you get a frond

42:01.379 --> 42:03.034
and you get a frond!

42:03.034 --> 42:06.241
I wanted to look like
I was lost in the jungle.

42:06.241 --> 42:07.586
I done lost my luggage

42:07.586 --> 42:09.241
and I just had to find
some scraps,

42:09.241 --> 42:11.310
you know, to make
my wedding with my man.

42:11.310 --> 42:13.275
My bouquet is big as hell.

42:13.275 --> 42:15.793
I'm really giving you
Wakanda jungle.

42:15.793 --> 42:17.620
Carson:
Thank you for being a frond.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.137
Category is Red, White
& Blue Bridal Couture.

42:27.137 --> 42:29.724
Up first, Daya Betty.

42:29.724 --> 42:32.034
Michelle:
Betsy Ross Mathews.

42:33.413 --> 42:36.103
This is inspired heavily

42:36.103 --> 42:39.310
by ugly eighties
bridesmaid dresses.

42:39.310 --> 42:41.068
I am really feeling this look.

42:41.068 --> 42:44.206
In a weird way, I feel like
I'm kind of embodying Michelle

42:44.206 --> 42:46.482
if Michelle was in
an ugly eighties dress.

42:46.482 --> 42:48.620
Christine:
She's a grand old drag.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.758
Carson:
Old Glory...hole.

42:50.758 --> 42:52.448
Uh-huh.

42:52.448 --> 42:54.137
Angeria.

42:54.137 --> 42:56.724
Michelle:
You can call her Angie. Check.

42:56.724 --> 42:59.068
Carson:
Pre-nup. Check.

43:00.655 --> 43:02.827
This is an Angeria
silhouette, honey,

43:02.827 --> 43:05.620
very fitted, sequined gown.

43:05.620 --> 43:07.517
Honey, the titties
is sitting up right.

43:07.517 --> 43:09.137
They all pushed up.

43:09.137 --> 43:10.862
Yes, honey,
this look is bridal,

43:10.862 --> 43:14.000
but it's still draggy,
and that is the Angeria way.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.413
Failed attempted
at hiding her elbows.

43:18.620 --> 43:20.379
DeJa Skye.

43:20.379 --> 43:23.896
If it ain't bro-quet,
don't fix it.

43:23.896 --> 43:28.620
I hit this runway
feeling regal AF.

43:28.620 --> 43:31.413
I love a gown moment,
I love showing off my curves.

43:31.413 --> 43:32.965
I'm taking my time.

43:32.965 --> 43:35.172
I'm going to make sure
that they see the workmanship

43:35.172 --> 43:37.103
that I put into this garment.

43:37.103 --> 43:40.379
Carson:
Look at that juicy sash.

43:40.379 --> 43:41.551
Mm-hmm.

43:41.551 --> 43:43.137
Jasmine Kennedie.

43:43.137 --> 43:46.827
Serving fish.
Starfish.

43:46.827 --> 43:50.896
Jasmine:
Goddamn, I did a good job.

43:50.896 --> 43:52.689
This usually takes me
three days to do,

43:52.689 --> 43:54.482
and the fact that
I did it in eight hours

43:54.482 --> 43:55.689
is blowing my mind.

43:55.689 --> 43:57.689
I just feel so beautiful.

43:57.689 --> 43:59.724
I feel like
Miss Congeniality I,

43:59.724 --> 44:02.241
but I'm not being Miss
Sandra Bullock and following.

44:02.241 --> 44:04.689
I'm being Miss Rhode Island
and winning the damn crown.

44:04.689 --> 44:07.000
Christine:
Little Miss Firecracker.

44:08.551 --> 44:10.689
Simply Jorgeous.

44:10.689 --> 44:13.689
San Antoni-ho.

44:13.689 --> 44:16.517
Bitch,
I'm a fucking hot-ass mami

44:16.517 --> 44:18.000
kind of bride, bitch.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.344
She is marrying some
hot-ass daddy right now.

44:21.344 --> 44:24.586
I just wanted to show
what Jorgeous would wear

44:24.586 --> 44:25.965
if she was getting married.

44:25.965 --> 44:28.482
I hear she likes
bitty-bitty-bum-bum.

44:30.655 --> 44:32.620
Lady Camden.

44:32.620 --> 44:35.275
Christine:
I pledge allegiance to the drag.

44:36.931 --> 44:38.758
Lady Camden:
She's getting married, darling.

44:38.758 --> 44:40.103
There's Uncle Henry.

44:40.103 --> 44:42.413
Oh, my God,
there's Aunt Lorraine.

44:42.413 --> 44:43.827
Oh, she brought the kids.

44:43.827 --> 44:45.344
I like to do things
a little bit glamorous,

44:45.344 --> 44:48.137
but I definitely add
a bit of craftiness to it.

44:48.137 --> 44:50.448
Something glamorous
with a touch of tackiness.

44:50.448 --> 44:51.689
Priscilla Presley

44:51.689 --> 44:54.000
got married
in this very same outfit.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.448
Thank you. Thank you very much.

44:56.896 --> 44:58.896
Maddy Morphosis.

44:58.896 --> 45:01.241
Carson:
Betsy Ross Dress For Less.

45:03.896 --> 45:06.275
I'm selling this bridal
look with a performance.

45:06.275 --> 45:09.137
I'm a girl who is so excited
about her wedding day.

45:09.137 --> 45:12.241
I just won my county fair
beauty pageant.

45:12.241 --> 45:16.103
I got engaged and I'm getting
married all in the same week.

45:16.103 --> 45:17.862
And the fun that I'm having
in this moment,

45:17.862 --> 45:20.482
this is my drag,
and this is what I do.

45:20.482 --> 45:23.517
If you can't marry yourself,
how the hell--

45:25.000 --> 45:27.344
Amen.

45:28.482 --> 45:29.758
Coming up...

45:29.758 --> 45:33.655
This bridal look
doesn't scream bride to me.

45:33.655 --> 45:35.206
You were kind of
smothered in lamÃ©.

45:35.206 --> 45:38.965
This is a com-pe-ti-shione.

45:45.137 --> 45:46.965
Welcome, queens.

45:46.965 --> 45:49.413
When I call your name,
please step forward.

45:50.931 --> 45:51.931
Alyssa Hunter.

45:53.344 --> 45:55.068
Bosco.

45:55.068 --> 45:58.655
Kerri Colby Carrington Morell.

45:58.655 --> 46:00.379
Kornbread.

46:00.379 --> 46:02.344
Daya Betty.

46:02.344 --> 46:04.517
DeJa Skye.

46:04.517 --> 46:07.000
Jasmine Kennedie.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.689
Lady Camden.

46:09.689 --> 46:13.137
Ladies, you're safe.

46:14.517 --> 46:17.206
You may leave the stage.

46:22.137 --> 46:24.689
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

46:24.689 --> 46:28.655
starting with
she don't want no big pill,

46:28.655 --> 46:31.206
she want a Willow Pill.

46:31.206 --> 46:33.068
First of all, I really enjoyed
all of your looks.

46:33.068 --> 46:34.517
The first one looked like

46:34.517 --> 46:37.344
you were gonna sell a fabulous
house in a resort town.

46:37.344 --> 46:39.931
Like, you're like you're
the number one broker in Boca.

46:39.931 --> 46:43.448
Your leopard evening wear
looked really pretty on you.

46:43.448 --> 46:45.413
One of my favorites
is black-on-black,

46:45.413 --> 46:46.827
so I love that
you chose that route.

46:46.827 --> 46:49.103
This is the show stopper
for me tonight,

46:49.103 --> 46:52.482
and I'm pleasantly surprised
by almost the entire cast.

46:52.482 --> 46:56.034
Finally, it took 14 years
of people understanding

46:56.034 --> 46:57.827
you need to sew
to be on this show,

46:57.827 --> 46:59.000
at least a basic way.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.586
But what you did
was not basic.

47:00.586 --> 47:02.655
I love how you balanced
some softness,

47:02.655 --> 47:04.551
a little edge, the netting.

47:04.551 --> 47:06.000
That just completed the look.

47:06.000 --> 47:11.379
This here
is absolutely stun-ning.

47:11.379 --> 47:13.241
Where'd you get
your sense of style?

47:13.241 --> 47:15.689
I think I've explored
bad taste for so long

47:15.689 --> 47:17.896
that I just ended up
getting good taste.

47:19.344 --> 47:21.965
Up next, Orion Story.

47:21.965 --> 47:23.517
Girl, you are beautiful.

47:23.517 --> 47:26.103
Look at that face.
Do you see that?

47:26.103 --> 47:27.551
Yeah.

47:32.310 --> 47:33.758
So I think for me tonight

47:33.758 --> 47:36.103
what was missing was
a little bit more versatility.

47:36.103 --> 47:39.448
I thought there was
a lot of repetitiveness.

47:39.448 --> 47:42.482
I don't golf, but if I had
an outfit like your resort wear,

47:42.482 --> 47:46.517
I definitely would swing
a couple of...rounds?

47:47.551 --> 47:49.068
The leopard evening gown,

47:49.068 --> 47:50.827
that was a little busy for me.

47:50.827 --> 47:52.758
You need to be careful about,
like, gilding the lily.

47:52.758 --> 47:55.586
It went, like, Halloween,

47:55.586 --> 47:57.241
I'm gonna put
some teeth in my hair.

47:57.241 --> 47:59.344
This one,
I actually don't mind.

47:59.344 --> 48:00.965
It's really cute,
really Peg Bundy.

48:00.965 --> 48:03.379
I don't know why those straps
are underneath there.

48:03.379 --> 48:05.103
It looks like you forgot to put
your arms through the straps,

48:05.103 --> 48:07.172
and I think you have
a bow on the butt,

48:07.172 --> 48:09.689
which I--yeah,
not really necessary.

48:09.689 --> 48:12.034
You got a lot going on here.

48:12.034 --> 48:14.551
It's too much, and that
was the constant thread

48:14.551 --> 48:16.103
throughout all of your outfits.

48:16.103 --> 48:18.724
So this is gonna be a challenge
for you in this competition.

48:18.724 --> 48:19.724
Mm-hmm.

48:19.724 --> 48:23.137
Up next, June Jambalaya.

48:23.137 --> 48:25.172
Ooh, my coffee enema
is kicking in.

48:25.172 --> 48:26.827
Ooh, honey.

48:26.827 --> 48:29.448
Damn.

48:29.448 --> 48:32.137
Your zebra print look
I thought was really pretty.

48:32.137 --> 48:34.620
I could see that
in a Grace Kelly movie.

48:34.620 --> 48:38.827
Definitely not coach travel,
it was private jet.

48:38.827 --> 48:41.000
Beautiful, chic.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.310
I thought the hair could have
used a little bit of love.

48:43.310 --> 48:45.344
To me, that felt
right out the bag.

48:45.344 --> 48:46.517
You went like this
and shoved it on your head.

48:46.517 --> 48:49.172
The leopard evening wear dress,

48:49.172 --> 48:51.241
you were kind of
smothered in lamÃ©.

48:51.241 --> 48:53.827
You were struggling
every single foot.

48:53.827 --> 48:56.758
It was so much fabric
that it got in your way.

48:56.758 --> 48:59.862
This look is my least favorite.

48:59.862 --> 49:02.379
You didn't move this at all.
You are keeping it here.

49:02.379 --> 49:03.896
I don't know
if you're trying to hide--

49:03.896 --> 49:07.137
Yeah, I feel like there's
a lot of bulk going on here.

49:07.137 --> 49:09.448
I can feel you
not being proud of it

49:09.448 --> 49:11.344
when you walk down the runway.

49:11.344 --> 49:12.413
What happened?

49:12.413 --> 49:16.827
This was a challenge for me.

49:16.827 --> 49:19.931
This is a com-pe-ti-shione.

49:19.931 --> 49:23.551
You have to find out
what works for your body.

49:23.551 --> 49:26.068
And, listen,
the trick to it, really,

49:26.068 --> 49:28.413
is if you are looking
at stars in magazines

49:28.413 --> 49:33.551
and people who have your same
body silhouette, just copy 'em.

49:33.551 --> 49:34.724
You ain't got
to reinvent the wheel.

49:34.724 --> 49:36.551
The wheel is fine, girl.

49:36.551 --> 49:38.068
You ain't gotta reinvent
the wheel!

49:38.068 --> 49:39.793
Ain't nobody gotta
reinvent the wheel.

49:39.793 --> 49:42.551
Caffeine. This is caffeine.

49:42.551 --> 49:43.655
So just copy a bitch.

49:43.655 --> 49:45.000
Thank you.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.482
Thank you.

49:46.482 --> 49:48.551
Up next, Angeria.

49:48.551 --> 49:50.206
Your red hot resort wear,

49:50.206 --> 49:53.827
it was just the right amount
of bounce and fullness.

49:53.827 --> 49:56.000
It was giving me
Marvin Gaye vibes,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.379
and I really wanted
to get it on.

49:59.965 --> 50:02.137
All of your looks and everything
I've seen thus far,

50:02.137 --> 50:04.586
it's edited and it's elevated.

50:04.586 --> 50:07.620
The evening wear look,
that's one of my favorite looks

50:07.620 --> 50:08.655
I've ever seen on Drag Race.

50:10.413 --> 50:12.724
This one, the construction
on the gown is gorgeous.

50:12.724 --> 50:14.931
This kind of seems to be
the thing of the moment,

50:14.931 --> 50:17.551
shoulder and arm capes,
and I kind of love it,

50:17.551 --> 50:19.379
because it adds
a little oomph.

50:19.379 --> 50:20.689
So three checks.

50:20.689 --> 50:22.344
Check, check, check.

50:22.344 --> 50:23.896
-Check?

50:23.896 --> 50:26.689
Up next, Jorgeous.

50:26.689 --> 50:28.344
The first disco look
was gorgeous,

50:28.344 --> 50:30.931
it was Jorgeous,
it was Gorg W. Bush.

50:33.862 --> 50:36.827
With your second look,
damn, girl, Ariana who?

50:36.827 --> 50:38.551
I loved it.

50:38.551 --> 50:39.965
I loved the fit.

50:39.965 --> 50:43.379
That white, smooth corsetry
is not easy to do.

50:43.379 --> 50:47.724
This bridal look
doesn't scream bride to me.

50:47.724 --> 50:51.482
I'm getting Evel Knievel
evening wear eleganza.

50:52.689 --> 50:55.896
This is inspired
by Selena Quintanilla.

50:55.896 --> 50:58.862
I wanted to make it different,
more open, more sexier.

50:58.862 --> 51:03.827
Your energy in every look
is just so fun and joyful.

51:03.827 --> 51:05.793
I gotta say, Jorgeous,
you know you were born for drag?

51:05.793 --> 51:07.068
You do it so well.

51:07.068 --> 51:09.241
You understand your silhouette.

51:09.241 --> 51:10.517
You understand your body.

51:10.517 --> 51:12.103
Lovely, Jorgeous.

51:12.103 --> 51:15.000
Maddy Morphosis, hello, doll.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Hi, Ru.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
So your red hot resort wear,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.172
that look was probably
my least favorite.

51:21.172 --> 51:23.620
It felt very pedestrian.

51:23.620 --> 51:25.413
It may have looked like

51:25.413 --> 51:27.172
you purchased it
at the resort gift shop.

51:27.172 --> 51:30.000
Your evening realness
and all-white look,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.551
I was hoping
for something magical.

51:32.551 --> 51:35.827
There was something missing
from that white--

51:35.827 --> 51:39.689
You know what it is?
That rrr thing.

51:39.689 --> 51:42.862
If you had walked out with
some more of that rrr,

51:42.862 --> 51:44.310
Aah.

51:44.310 --> 51:48.620
That, oh, yes,
my pussy is on fire. Aah.

51:48.620 --> 51:50.379
That's what was missing.

51:50.379 --> 51:51.965
You've got the basics of it.

51:51.965 --> 51:55.758
You're just missing
that rrr!

51:55.758 --> 51:59.103
Aah, aah.

51:59.103 --> 52:02.172
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

52:02.172 --> 52:04.068
-You're missing that.
-Caffeine.

52:04.068 --> 52:05.896
Have you tried coffee enemas?

52:05.896 --> 52:08.586
This look,
what I love most about it

52:08.586 --> 52:11.482
was your little storyline
that you were giving to us.

52:11.482 --> 52:14.655
I really do love
the base of this dress,

52:14.655 --> 52:16.379
but the accessories
don't work with it.

52:16.379 --> 52:19.413
I don't know if I have
the best eye for, like, design.

52:19.413 --> 52:20.965
So it's really just
trying to put together

52:20.965 --> 52:23.103
what things I think would work.

52:23.103 --> 52:25.413
Yeah, listen,
if all else fails, copy.

52:25.413 --> 52:27.551
What'd I say about the wheel?

52:27.551 --> 52:28.793
It ain't broke.

52:28.793 --> 52:30.241
You ain't got
to reinvent the wheel.

52:32.172 --> 52:33.517
You ain't gotta
reinvent the wheel.

52:33.517 --> 52:35.965
The wheel is fine.

52:35.965 --> 52:37.620
Ooh, child, that coffee enema
is coming for me.

52:39.586 --> 52:42.068
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

52:42.068 --> 52:44.517
And I think I may have had
too much coffee.

52:44.517 --> 52:47.724
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

52:47.724 --> 52:49.310
the judges and I
will deliberate.

52:50.620 --> 52:53.482
Now, just between
us squirrel friends,

52:53.482 --> 52:56.931
what do you think,
starting with Willow Pill?

52:56.931 --> 52:59.241
She took us from Florida
to Italy.

52:59.241 --> 53:02.620
She gave us a really out
of the box version of bridal.

53:02.620 --> 53:04.827
Everything was right
about that pantsuit.

53:04.827 --> 53:06.896
It was brilliant.

53:06.896 --> 53:11.310
Tonight was a very good night
for Willow Pill.

53:11.310 --> 53:14.241
All right, let's move on down
to Orion Story.

53:14.241 --> 53:15.379
All three of her looks

53:15.379 --> 53:17.482
kind of could have been
interchangeable.

53:17.482 --> 53:21.241
It was a little too Jersey
and not enough couture for me.

53:21.241 --> 53:23.586
Hey! Watch what you say
about Jersey!

53:23.586 --> 53:25.172
Sorry! I love Jersey!

53:25.172 --> 53:26.517
Yeah, good girl.

53:26.517 --> 53:28.034
Her Achilles' heel is thinking

53:28.034 --> 53:29.758
that she has to do
more, more, more,

53:29.758 --> 53:31.482
and she just really
needs to edit.

53:31.482 --> 53:33.000
June Jambalaya.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Leopard evening realness,
she could not walk in it.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.965
Preparation would have been
really helpful for her.

53:37.965 --> 53:41.206
And then the wedding gown
was just a mess. I'm sorry.

53:41.206 --> 53:44.655
And you could see
her discomfort in that look

53:44.655 --> 53:46.862
and holding that bouquet up
to kind of cover it.

53:46.862 --> 53:50.000
I was not frond
of that look at all.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.517
June is so beautiful,

53:52.517 --> 53:54.724
and I wish she had
more confidence in that.

53:54.724 --> 53:57.206
You know, some people can wear
something that's ill-fitting

53:57.206 --> 53:58.931
and actually make it work.

53:58.931 --> 54:01.172
She did not.

54:01.172 --> 54:05.068
Angeria Paris VanMicheals.

54:05.068 --> 54:08.517
The shimmering, all-white
evening wear, unbelievable.

54:08.517 --> 54:10.517
She looked like she was,
like, a televangelist,

54:10.517 --> 54:13.379
for a very, very wealthy
alien nation,

54:13.379 --> 54:15.551
and I was like, yes,
I wanna get on your spaceship!

54:15.551 --> 54:17.172
It was so good.

54:17.172 --> 54:19.137
She knew what to do
in all three categories,

54:19.137 --> 54:22.655
and her background with Atlanta
drag really served her well.

54:22.655 --> 54:24.862
Loved everything she did.

54:24.862 --> 54:25.931
Jorgeous.

54:25.931 --> 54:27.551
For me, it's all about energy.

54:27.551 --> 54:29.379
She's so compelling on stage.

54:29.379 --> 54:31.379
You just can't stop watching.

54:31.379 --> 54:33.586
The bridal eleganza
and red, white, and blue,

54:33.586 --> 54:37.103
that X-shape that she created
with the silver sequins

54:37.103 --> 54:40.172
was so great at creating
an hourglass illusion.

54:40.172 --> 54:42.896
It wasn't bridal, but I'm
still kind of married to it.

54:44.482 --> 54:46.241
Maddy Morphosis.

54:46.241 --> 54:47.551
She comes out in the Red Hot,

54:47.551 --> 54:50.655
and it was pretty wrong
on many levels,

54:50.655 --> 54:54.000
but mostly because
I wasn't feeling anything.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.862
Bridal Eleganza, somehow
that movie Nashville

54:56.862 --> 54:58.068
-kind of resonates for me.
-Yes.

54:58.068 --> 54:59.172
I'm getting that feeling.

54:59.172 --> 55:00.448
It was a good job on the dress,

55:00.448 --> 55:03.379
but again, just not
feeling the fantasy.

55:03.379 --> 55:05.344
Yeah. All right, silence.

55:05.344 --> 55:07.172
I've made my decision.

55:07.172 --> 55:08.758
Bring back my girls.

55:14.137 --> 55:16.724
Welcome back, ladies.

55:16.724 --> 55:19.517
I've made some decisions.

55:23.344 --> 55:25.551
Jorgeous.

55:25.551 --> 55:26.827
You're safe.

55:26.827 --> 55:28.586
Gracias.Thank you
so much, judges.

55:28.586 --> 55:30.275
You may join the other girls.

55:30.275 --> 55:31.241
Thank you.

55:33.724 --> 55:37.586
Willow Pill. We loved
your ball looks so much

55:37.586 --> 55:39.068
we wanna marry 'em.

55:41.206 --> 55:42.551
Con-drag-ulations.

55:42.551 --> 55:44.862
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

55:47.931 --> 55:50.689
You've won a cash prize
of $5,000.

55:53.034 --> 55:54.275
Thank you.

55:54.275 --> 55:57.586
Oh, my gosh, I feel so happy.

55:57.586 --> 56:02.965
And also, $5,000
is just, like, chef's kiss.

56:04.379 --> 56:06.689
Angeria.

56:06.689 --> 56:07.862
You're safe.

56:12.586 --> 56:16.310
Orion. Tonight your looks
told a story,

56:16.310 --> 56:18.379
but you need a good editor.

56:19.896 --> 56:21.379
June Jambalaya.

56:21.379 --> 56:25.413
Tonight the judges
did not say yes to the dress.

56:26.862 --> 56:28.689
Maddy Morphosis.

56:28.689 --> 56:30.241
You gave the judges

56:30.241 --> 56:34.000
a case of the wedding bell
red, white, and blues.

56:39.344 --> 56:41.379
Orion Story...

56:41.379 --> 56:42.931
you are safe.

56:45.137 --> 56:47.206
You may join the other girls.

56:47.206 --> 56:48.793
Thank you.

56:48.793 --> 56:51.551
June, Maddy,

56:51.551 --> 56:55.482
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

56:55.482 --> 56:58.413
I am so pissed at myself.

56:58.413 --> 57:01.034
I am so determined
to stay in this competition,

57:01.034 --> 57:03.344
and I am gonna sell
the fuck out of this song.

57:03.344 --> 57:05.896
Two queens stand before me.

57:07.241 --> 57:09.896
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:09.896 --> 57:13.965
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:16.103 --> 57:18.068
The time has come...

57:18.068 --> 57:20.620
for you to lip sync...

57:20.620 --> 57:23.862
for your life!

57:26.862 --> 57:32.758
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

58:11.344 --> 58:13.551
Aah!

58:15.413 --> 58:17.275
I wanna stay so bad.

58:17.275 --> 58:20.586
I'm going to do
everything in my power

58:20.586 --> 58:23.241
to make them know
that I want to be here.

58:40.241 --> 58:41.827
June, oh, no, baby.

58:41.827 --> 58:45.241
Please don't tell me you done
kicked your damn shoes off.

58:45.241 --> 58:49.344
-Oh, my God, her shoes.

59:04.310 --> 59:07.482
I almost slipped on what
used to be, I think, her skirt.

59:07.482 --> 59:09.551
June's outfit
put her in the bottom,

59:09.551 --> 59:13.000
and I'm worried it's about
to take me out also.

59:24.172 --> 59:26.827
Ladies, I've made my decision.

59:34.896 --> 59:36.413
Maddy Morphosis.

59:36.413 --> 59:37.586
Shantay you stay.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.034
You may join the other girls.

59:43.034 --> 59:44.413
Thank you.

59:44.413 --> 59:47.310
June.

59:47.310 --> 59:49.896
Now your fate

59:49.896 --> 59:53.000
rests in the hands
of the drag gods.

59:54.689 --> 59:57.172
You've been hiding your candy.

59:57.172 --> 1:00:00.931
If you have the gold bar,
you will be saved.

1:00:02.103 --> 1:00:04.413
There's still a chance

1:00:04.413 --> 1:00:07.068
that June could unwrap
the golden chocolate bar.

1:00:07.068 --> 1:00:10.896
So now is the moment of truth.

1:00:10.896 --> 1:00:12.206
Now...

1:00:13.827 --> 1:00:14.896
Let's see what you got.

1:00:17.172 --> 1:00:20.241
I wanna stay
in this competition so badly.

1:00:20.241 --> 1:00:22.620
Please pray for me. Oh.

1:00:27.137 --> 1:00:30.068
It's chocolate.

1:00:30.068 --> 1:00:32.206
I'm sorry, my dear.

1:00:32.206 --> 1:00:35.517
June Jambalaya.

1:00:35.517 --> 1:00:37.862
Now that
you've given us a taste,

1:00:37.862 --> 1:00:40.482
the world is going to want more.

1:00:40.482 --> 1:00:44.241
Now sashay away.

1:00:44.241 --> 1:00:48.862
Thank you guys so much
for this amazing opportunity.

1:00:48.862 --> 1:00:51.275
God bless.

1:00:51.275 --> 1:00:53.379
Yes, sister!

1:00:53.379 --> 1:00:55.551
We love you, June!

1:00:55.551 --> 1:00:57.000
We love you, baby.

1:00:58.137 --> 1:01:00.137
There's always room
for two things.

1:01:00.137 --> 1:01:02.827
That's AlizÃ© and jambalaya.

1:01:05.137 --> 1:01:08.413
Even though it didn't go
as expected,

1:01:08.413 --> 1:01:12.000
I am still so grateful
for this opportunity.

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.482
But I do regret overthinking
a lot of things,

1:01:16.482 --> 1:01:19.827
and not living in the moment.

1:01:19.827 --> 1:01:22.137
I wanna continue to grow,

1:01:22.137 --> 1:01:24.896
and I hope to see you guys
on the road.

1:01:28.448 --> 1:01:30.758
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:01:30.758 --> 1:01:33.758
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:33.758 --> 1:01:35.448
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:35.448 --> 1:01:37.137
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:37.137 --> 1:01:38.310
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:38.310 --> 1:01:40.862
All right.
Now let the music play!

1:01:53.965 --> 1:01:55.724
Next time
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

1:01:55.724 --> 1:01:57.068
Hey, queens.

1:01:58.482 --> 1:02:01.551
!Â¡Te amo, JLo.
Te amo, te amo, te amo!

1:02:01.551 --> 1:02:04.827
You'll produce tension-grabbing
super-teasers.

1:02:04.827 --> 1:02:06.275
Action.

1:02:06.275 --> 1:02:09.103
Thisis not RuPaul's
Hospitality Race!

1:02:09.103 --> 1:02:10.931
I'm straight, too!

1:02:10.931 --> 1:02:12.344
-Oh!
-What?

1:02:12.344 --> 1:02:15.275
Y'all the ones that
are talking the whole time.

1:02:15.275 --> 1:02:17.586
You're supposed
to continue to rant.

1:02:18.896 --> 1:02:20.034
You were fun to watch.

1:02:20.034 --> 1:02:21.793
It actually made me
laugh out loud.

1:02:21.793 --> 1:02:25.793
I don't wanna see any more
flip-flops on my stage!

1:02:25.793 --> 1:02:29.344
Drag Raceis a very
stressful situation...

1:02:29.344 --> 1:02:31.000
-Aah!

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.655
But that's a lot
of emotions for safe.
