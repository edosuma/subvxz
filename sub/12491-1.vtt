00:24.040 --> 00:26.485
Hey, guys. Tonight is the Purge...

00:26.560 --> 00:29.882
and I want all
of my white friends to be safe.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.325
Rules of the Purge. You have 12 hours...

00:34.400 --> 00:38.200
to do any crime you want
against anyone you want.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.845
You can shoot, kill, stab.

00:40.920 --> 00:44.003
Twelve hours of death, mayhem.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.885
Lock your doors. Protect yourself.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.644
Make sure your rent is paid...

00:48.720 --> 00:50.245
and all of your pets are put up.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.005
But the most important rule of all...

00:53.080 --> 00:55.321
stay tight, stay white...

00:55.400 --> 00:57.880
and this is only gonna last one night.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.246
Let the games begin.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.765
All right, I wasn't gonna do this,
but forget it.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.126
Here goes nothing.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.491
This is a story
about the worst day of my life.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.364
Well, one of them.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.005
See, I was wiring shit,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.560
car stereos, alarms, you name it.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.685
Don't Hate Wiring, that's my company.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.922
And that's me, Carl Black.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.205
You see this ugly cat right here?

01:36.280 --> 01:39.204
That's Key Flo, a big-time drug dealer.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.405
One day while working on his alarm...

01:41.480 --> 01:42.845
Key Flo got busted.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.125
They took his ass far away.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.565
What they didn't know was in his house
was a lot of money.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.445
So I took it as a payment
for all the work I did.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.363
With a payday like this...

01:53.440 --> 01:57.045
it was time to move.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.885
Well, I did owe a few people
in Chicago a few things...

01:59.960 --> 02:02.122
but no one's tripping.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.041
So I loaded up the family
and got the hell out of Chicago.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.125
Leaving Chicago before the Purge...

02:14.200 --> 02:16.123
was the greatest thing I ever done.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.084
I met this cool dude on the Internet...

02:19.200 --> 02:22.245
who helped us qualify
for this big-ass house in Beverly Hills.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.125
I might've falsified a few things...

02:25.200 --> 02:28.170
but, hey, this is for my family.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.484
Those are my kids.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.643
My son Carl Jr. thinks he's a damn vampire.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.445
Think again, buddy.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.648
And this dummy with this do-rag?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.569
That's my little cousin Cronut.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.444
He went to jail for some parking tickets...

02:41.520 --> 02:43.488
and now he think he's a gangster.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.284
Ride my mustache.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.601
That's my beautiful wife.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.206
Did I mention
the greatest thing about my move?

02:51.560 --> 02:54.125
Rich people don't purge.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.168
Getting the hell out of Chicago...

02:56.280 --> 02:58.442
was the best thing ever.

02:58.520 --> 03:02.081
Well, here's how the worst day started.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.444
Hey, come on, man!

03:12.520 --> 03:14.005
Hey, how you doing, sir?

03:14.080 --> 03:16.445
- You lost?
- I beg your pardon?

03:16.520 --> 03:18.565
Man, you gotta be. Check this out.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.324
Go right down here, make a U-turn...

03:20.400 --> 03:21.856
then you can pull right out,
and you'll get back...

03:21.880 --> 03:23.216
to wherever it is you need to get to.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.965
- I live here.
- No. No, I'm serious, man.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.685
I live right there at Cherry Blossom.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.410
- I'm Carl Black.
- Black?

03:29.520 --> 03:30.925
You said Carl Black?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.923
I just moved from Chicago.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.002
Man, listen, I'm gonna
be real with you, man.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.445

03:38.000 --> 03:39.736

that living here, all right?

03:39.760 --> 03:40.841
Save me some trouble, man.

03:40.920 --> 03:45.284
We've been having all these break-ins
and the rappers dance, loud mus... rims.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.283
Come on, man. Look at you, man.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.576
You can't live here, man. Go on and make...

03:48.600 --> 03:50.409
Don't fucking try to play me like this!

03:54.680 --> 03:57.045
I live here! I'm fucking crazy!

03:57.120 --> 03:58.605
Look at my eye right here.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.336
- Forest Whitaker eye.
- Okay, you're right. I see.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.485
I found it. You're right.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.936
Carl Black. Right here. Carl Black.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.201
- You said I can go?
- My bad, man.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.521
Thank you, brother.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.802
Have a nice day, man. I'm sorry.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.644
- I'm sorry.
- Bitch.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.485
Please don't tell me
your ass is in California.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.005
Don't call my phone no more.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.684
You told me you were going to the store!

04:23.760 --> 04:25.285
- I'm married now.
- You're married?

04:25.360 --> 04:27.601
You keep blowing up...
Look, you pissing me off...

04:27.680 --> 04:29.284
to the highest of "pisstivity."

04:29.360 --> 04:31.165
"Pisstivity" ain't even a word, dumbass.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.205
Shoranda, I don't wanna
be over at your house...

04:33.280 --> 04:35.240
with all them kids over there
smelling like urine.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.681
I know you didn't
just say that about my kids.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.045
You bitch, nigga!

04:52.120 --> 04:54.165
Come out! Come to me!

04:54.240 --> 04:56.288
Everybody is gonna come in your house...

04:56.400 --> 04:58.084
they're gonna fuck you!

05:01.080 --> 05:02.809
I've traveled a long way to find you.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.082
Hey! Caesar!

05:06.200 --> 05:07.525
Don't try to play me.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.245
You're Carl Black from Chicago, right?

05:09.320 --> 05:11.845
Yeah, and you're Caesar
from The Planet of the Apes, right?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.082
Do I look like a fucking joke to you?

05:14.160 --> 05:17.365
- Yeah.
- Consider yourself served.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.522
Hey, man!
Don't hit me with no... don't do that!

05:19.600 --> 05:21.125
Don't do that.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.605
You're harassing me.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.405
You're at my mansion. I'm in Beverly Hills.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.641
No, don't do that.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.176
If you didn't do nothing wrong,
if you was a perfect human being...

05:28.200 --> 05:30.085
none of this shit would happen.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.136
- I wouldn't have to be here.
- I ain't did nothing wrong!

05:32.160 --> 05:33.605
You're racial profiling me!

05:33.680 --> 05:35.885
You're too black
to profile another black person.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.962
- What's wrong?
- "Do I think you're black"?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.280
Look at me and look at you!

05:39.400 --> 05:42.244
- We are both black people.
- You are black as fuck.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.376
What the fuck? Don't say that.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.445
Don't put that Ebola finger in my face.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.325
- No...
- Look at your feet.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.656
What the fuck is wrong with my feet?

05:48.680 --> 05:49.885
You think this shit is a game?

05:49.960 --> 05:51.765
You fucking redbone bitch...

05:51.840 --> 05:53.922
don't ever disrespect
my feet like that again.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.085
- I'm not disrespecting you.
- Yes, you are...

05:56.160 --> 05:57.565
and it's because of your company...

05:57.640 --> 05:59.165

05:59.240 --> 06:01.605

06:01.680 --> 06:04.001

- Not just restaurant.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.765
African restaurant in the city of Chicago!

06:07.840 --> 06:09.125
Who else have you fucked up?

06:09.200 --> 06:11.325
I done wired all these different houses.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.736
I'm from the hood. I made it out of there.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.405
We wired Bishop Tutu's hut.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.324
We wired Idi Amin's bathroom.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.285
So get on out of here, man.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.964
You're very disrespectful.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.441
- Well, you bitch nigga.
- No, you're a bitch nigga.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.405

your black ass in...

06:28.440 --> 06:29.885

06:29.960 --> 06:31.445
Hey, who are you talking to?

06:31.520 --> 06:32.965

06:33.080 --> 06:34.600

06:39.680 --> 06:42.045

You're the only nigga
in this neighborhood...

06:46.240 --> 06:47.685

06:47.800 --> 06:49.205
Yes, I Googled you.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.691
Get the fuck off the door.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.845
Don't worry, Lestat.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.843
We will teach them all!

06:57.920 --> 06:59.524
As the purging descends...

06:59.600 --> 07:02.565

their rightful place...

07:02.640 --> 07:05.962

All he does is jack off all day.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.801
Okay, Carl. Carl, I'm gonna need you...

08:45.920 --> 08:47.285

- No, his tongue was enough.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.121
It's just wrong, baby. I don't...

09:03.200 --> 09:06.005
He's probably smelling
your panties in there...

09:06.080 --> 09:07.296
- lying around the house.
- Oh, lord.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.765
Man, hide your underwear
around the bedroom. Shit.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.842
- Are you gonna answer that?
- Yeah, I got it.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.045
Yeah, this might be...
Oh, that ain't nothing.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.088
- Carl, pick up your phone.
- What?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.485
I can't answer the phone.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.216
Ain't nothing but my friends from Chicago.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.641
- What friends from Chicago?
- A bunch of drug dealers...

09:21.720 --> 09:23.245
and all kind of crazy motherfuckers...

09:23.320 --> 09:25.004

- Killing.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.845
- I need to go home.
- Carl.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.885
People keep saying Pur...
We in Beverly Hills.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.564
This is a gated community.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.961
We've got security.
We don't have no Purge problems.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.485
Not tonight. Need to go home.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.289
- 100, please.
- Yeah.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.805
- 100 in what?
- $100.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.484
It's a Purge coming.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.016
Ain't nothing you can do with no $100.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.845
- Once the Purge comes...
- Carl, cash, money!

09:57.920 --> 09:59.645
Just pay her the $100, please, baby.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.205
- $100. Let me handle this.
- Ming.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.203
Ming, listen to me.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.520
Pay me cash!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.805
I told you
that I was gonna pay you in credit.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.525
Credit is king in America, okay?

10:09.600 --> 10:15.004
Pay me in cash, or I purge
your ass tonight, bitch.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.776
- Come on, you done disrespecting me.
- What the hell?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.325
Just pay her.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.016
- You said you were rich.
- I tried to give you a chance...

10:20.040 --> 10:21.201
but you disrespected me.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.165
Get your ass out of here, both of y'all.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.045
I'm gonna fuck your wife!
I'm gonna crush her pussy!

10:26.120 --> 10:28.327
Back up, Wesley Snipes and his new wife.

10:28.440 --> 10:31.205
What? Who is that African man?

10:31.280 --> 10:32.884
Wesley Snipes.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.576
He just got out of jail. You didn't hear...

10:34.600 --> 10:36.204
- Carl.
- I ain't gotta play.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.482
- Baby.
- Stop.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.562
Come on. Don't do that. I can't do it.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.404
- Come on.
- Can't do what?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.562
- What is the deal?
- Who was that man?

10:44.640 --> 10:46.722
I don't know who they was.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.685
They's people from my past, okay?

10:48.760 --> 10:50.165
It wasn't Wesley Snipes, though.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.005
I mean, he was black
as hell like him, but it wasn't him.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.525
Carl, the only thing I need
to know from you right now...

10:55.600 --> 10:58.325
I swear you better not lie.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.085
- Do we have this money?
- We got the money.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.083
Look, your ass is standing
in a big-ass mansion.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.525
I bought you a brand-new car.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.176
What the hell? What are you worried about?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.725
I'm worried about how you got it.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.484
What did you do to get it?

11:09.560 --> 11:11.605
Okay, what did I do?

11:11.680 --> 11:14.081
I did a little dancing in Atlanta.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.045
Male gigoloing.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.056
Did something strange
for a little piece of change.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.525
No. No, for real.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.485
Look, I got a chain
of Wing and Things that I landed.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.976
That's what I'm doing. I'm going around

11:24.000 --> 11:26.082
hooking up wiring
all over from here to San Diego.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.764
Baby, I want to believe you...

11:27.840 --> 11:31.561
but I can't keep uprooting this family...

11:31.640 --> 11:33.445
in the middle of the night again.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.125
I can't do that, okay?
These kids need to trust me.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.123
They need to believe
that we're in a family...

11:38.200 --> 11:39.760
that we're a unit, that they're secure.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.361
- I don't feel that right now.
- Babe, the kids do trust you.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.925
They hate me, Carl.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.445
The kids don't hate you.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.176
No, they don't. You guys just need
to get to know each other a little bit.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.282
- I'm trying.
- And I know that you're getting upset.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.485
It's irritating you to
see little Carl Jr...

11:53.560 --> 11:55.642
running around here
with a little Batman outfit...

11:55.720 --> 11:57.484
with his little ass cheeks cut out.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.483
- It's a vampire.
- Okay, a vampire outfit.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.801
And Allie's running around with Mr.
Frosty...

12:01.880 --> 12:04.485
- whoever the fuck he is.
- His name is Freeze.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.525
Yeah, I'ma freeze his ass.
That's what I'ma do.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.080
Please trust me on this.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.965
- I have trusted you.
- Well, keep trusting me, then.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.925
We got the Wings and Things...

12:15.000 --> 12:17.285
we got the house, we got the car.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.045
Look, let's enjoy this.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.565
- You living the life.
- Okay.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.404
I'm gonna believe you.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.685
- Believe me.
- Bye-bye.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.842
Carl Black!

12:28.920 --> 12:31.730
And you are Mexican and black.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.208
- Carl, goodbye.
- I'll be right back, all right?

12:36.640 --> 12:38.244
We interrupt our program...

12:38.360 --> 12:40.681
to bring you this important message.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.285
As everyone knows, tonight is the Purge.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.603
- Oh, my God.
- And you know why we gotta purge.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.045
First of all...

12:51.120 --> 12:53.485
for all of you who keep thieving...

12:53.560 --> 12:57.121
killing, selling drugs that we can't tax...

12:57.200 --> 12:59.680
for all you who ain't
paying your child support...

12:59.760 --> 13:03.045
but just bought a brand-new Xbox
and some Jordans.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.441
I'm talking to bankers
making a cool million...

13:05.520 --> 13:07.204
each time you sneeze...

13:07.280 --> 13:09.362
while the public can't afford
to pay the mortgages...

13:09.440 --> 13:11.124
that you sold them.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.204
So tonight, as Americans...

13:14.280 --> 13:16.565
we purge.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.484
Hey, if you ain't done nothing wrong...

13:19.560 --> 13:21.365
you got nothing to worry about.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.405
Purge ain't about you.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.482
It's about the rest of you.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.164
And you know who you are.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.686
Good thing we're in Beverly Hills.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.402
Yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.240
Knock, knock.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.281
Yeah!

14:05.840 --> 14:07.842
They gonna love this back in Chicago.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.725
Somebody's got to do it.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.125
Yeah, we're in the money!

14:18.200 --> 14:20.282
We got money!

14:20.360 --> 14:21.776
Where'd you get all this money from?

14:21.800 --> 14:23.802
- Damn, girl!
- Hold on, hold on, girl.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.644
- Hold on.
- All right.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.725
What?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.365
Who is this?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.765
Hey, girl, let me call you back.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.616
You better call Freezee.
You know he be tripping.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.801
- All right.
- Love you, girl.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.085
All right, love you, too. Bye!

14:41.160 --> 14:42.810
Bye!

14:48.560 --> 14:51.040
This is some dumb shit.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.885
Big Sean!

15:56.960 --> 15:58.845
Oh, nigga, I thought you was Big Sean.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.160
Freezee!

16:00.240 --> 16:02.885
What are you doing here?
You scared me half to death.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.042
You know I couldn't be
in Chicago without you, baby.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.246
I'm rich.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.522
If you say you're my friend,
you're my friend!

16:08.600 --> 16:10.364
Baby, stop. My dad!

16:10.440 --> 16:12.204
Baby, how did you get here?

16:12.280 --> 16:14.216
- You don't have a car.
- Baby, with love like ours...

16:14.240 --> 16:15.736
I don't need a car. I took the Greyhound.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.976
- You took the Greyhound?
- Three days and three nights...

16:18.000 --> 16:20.120
just like Jesus Christ did
in the desert with Moses...

16:20.160 --> 16:22.401
Adam and Eve. "Holy-lujah."

16:23.240 --> 16:24.446
Baby.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.365
Oh, my God. If Dad catches you here...

16:27.440 --> 16:28.925
you know he's gonna kill you.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.162
Look, I'ma take my chances with your dad.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.816
Matter of fact, it might
be nice to see him.

16:32.840 --> 16:33.921
- Pop him one time.
- What?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.570
- Call him "pop" one time.
- Stop it.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.762
- Pop that nigga one time.
- Baby, stop it.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.320
- Allie Black!
- I've been going to church for you.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.656
Well, then why did Keisha say...

16:41.680 --> 16:43.842
you was with that thot Valerie
last night, then?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.604
- Keisha be talking bullshit!
- Nah.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.736
You can't be believing Keisha, man.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.976
Baby, I love you. Look at me, look at me.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.002
Repeat after me, baby. I...

16:50.080 --> 16:51.885
- I.
- Love.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.605
- Love.
- Sex.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.045
I knew you wanted the D, baby.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.000
- Let me get it one time from the back.
- Allie!

16:58.840 --> 17:01.205
Bet you didn't think
I'd be participating tonight.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.725
Purge?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.444
They're still on that shit?

17:04.520 --> 17:07.125
But your president is a man of the people.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.363
And like you, I got the urge to purge.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.405
Purge these nuts.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.605
It's going down, y'all.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.444
Jay Leno, you got a lot of cars.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.085
Pick a fast one, motherfucker.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.845
Allie, the TV's fucked up again.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.885
Hey, nigga! Fuck you, nigga!

17:22.960 --> 17:24.605
Shut the fuck up, nigga.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.776
Hold on, you ain't gonna be
treating me like no side bitch.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.405
Baby, please, please.
You're gonna get me in trouble!

17:29.480 --> 17:30.816
- You're gonna get me in...
- Allie!

17:30.840 --> 17:33.320
Say, "Fuck you, Dad,"
and then make me a sandwich.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.536
- Make me a sandwich.
- Okay, I'll make you...

17:34.560 --> 17:35.696
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.165
- Allie!
- All right, Daddy, I'm coming!

17:38.240 --> 17:39.565
All right, Daddy, fuck you!

17:39.640 --> 17:42.564
- I said it in your voice.
- Shut up!

17:42.640 --> 17:44.722
Allie Black!

17:44.800 --> 17:47.280
- What's up, Daddy?
- Don't you hear me calling you?

17:47.360 --> 17:49.005
I'm trying to... What are you doing?

17:49.080 --> 17:51.845
- Nothing.
- No place that you are safe.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.205
I'm trying to get this TV working.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.165
It's on some bullshit.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.176
Well, dang, Daddy,
ain't this what you do for a living?

17:58.200 --> 17:59.656
Yeah, but I didn't wire this shit up.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.921
Some white man wired this up.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.843
This ain't nigga-rigged.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.003
Hey, you know what would be great?
Two birds with one stone?

18:07.080 --> 18:09.162
If you could hide in Erik Estrada's house.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.685
Everything on here is the Purge.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.364
- I know.
- You ain't gonna be able...

18:13.440 --> 18:14.680
to watch nothing else today.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.842
It's the government, the Purge.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.736
All right, well, we ain't scared
of no damn Purge.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.524
- We're from Cook County.
- What?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.485
We grew up on food stamps.
That's the Purge.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.576
- Shit.
- We know this life.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.204
- First and 15.
- What?

18:26.280 --> 18:27.605
- Nigga.
- Yeah.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.523
- Fix the TV.
- All right.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.045
Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'ma be out there.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.685
Let me get this call.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.366
- So go do it now.
- Hello?

18:38.440 --> 18:41.284
I'm gonna take this for myself, bitch.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.885
- He called me down here for nothing.
- I live in Beverly Hills now.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.008
I don't live in Chicago.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.804
Locating enemy target.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.960
Locating enemy target.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.405
Target locked.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.165
Carl's Jr., stop it!

19:07.240 --> 19:09.561
Junior, you get that out of here!

19:14.920 --> 19:17.002
Holy shit!

19:33.680 --> 19:35.364
You know what?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.602
Carl needs me.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.081
He needs me to take all this.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.925
Thank you. Just take all this little money.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.129
And all this weed in the house.
We got kids in here.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.842
Cronut!

19:50.960 --> 19:52.445
Freezee, you can't stay here.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.851
- You...
- What you mean?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.042
- Look, you gotta go.
- Where am I supposed to go?

19:56.120 --> 19:57.963
I don't know, but you
can't stay here, nigga.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.690
- You gotta go.
- It's sundown, baby.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.961
I'll get my ass purged quick.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.485
Baby, I've seen it.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.723
- They purge niggas like me quick.
- I don't wanna get you purged.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.325
Well, then... I mean, what...

20:07.400 --> 20:09.641
- Come on.
- My dad, man.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.041
I'll handle your dad. Let me stay.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.202
Please let me stay. Come on.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.044
Do it for us. Let me put the tip in.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.605
Let me stay. Pick one or the other.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.045
All right. Okay.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.804
- Okay, I can smash?
- No!

20:20.880 --> 20:23.645
You can stay, but you...
Baby, listen to me.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.405
You have to be quiet.
My dad don't play that shit.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.896
Baby, you gotta be quiet
'cause you know when I lay it down...

20:28.920 --> 20:32.163
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Shut up.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.083
45, 47.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.201
- Carl?
- What's up?

20:37.280 --> 20:39.325
- We need to talk.
- I thought we already talked.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.687
- Where's the kids?
- Cronut's disgusting.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.085
- Cronut?
- Allie and Carl's Jr. both hate me.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.456
- I don't know what to do, Carl.
- Come on, just have a seat.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.084
Come on, come on, come on, relax.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.685
Just talk to me. What is the deal?

20:50.760 --> 20:53.885
I can't live in this house...

20:53.960 --> 20:57.123
knowing that there is a man
fully masturbating to me.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.405
There's a tent coming up
in his pants every time I'm around.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.525
Okay, okay, look. Cronut, he been in jail.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.240
He's been in prison. He's a little weird.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.645
- But let me control that, okay?
- When?

21:06.720 --> 21:09.765
I'm gonna get ahold of
his little ass. Relax.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.045
Let me get the little leprechaun
in my possession.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.405
- Kick his ass out.
- Look, I'ma go talk to Cronut...

21:14.480 --> 21:16.045
and we're gonna have a family meeting.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.804
We're gonna get together. Let's...

21:17.920 --> 21:19.245
Let me handle it, okay?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.243
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.685
- Thank you.
- Okay, baby.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.371
All right, let me go talk to Allie.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.320
I gotta find a way to
make this family work.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.850
Shit.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.605
Cronut!

21:36.280 --> 21:37.770
Cronut.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.124
Cronut.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.288
Cronut.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.805
Don't be playing around, Cronut.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.362
Yeah, you see this? You see it?

22:06.440 --> 22:07.925
You ride my mustache.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.240
Ride my mustache.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.641
Don't act like you don't... Don't act.

22:15.440 --> 22:18.005
- What are you doing?
- Come on, cuz. We cousins.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.096
- Don't be scaring me like that.
- I asked you to come out here, man...

22:20.120 --> 22:21.565
and look at my SUV, man...

22:21.640 --> 22:23.176
and change the oil. What the fuck is this?

22:23.200 --> 22:24.964
I was trying to change the oil, man...

22:25.040 --> 22:26.685
but the oil's so gooky and shit...

22:26.760 --> 22:28.805
it's like dried-up nut. I can't do that.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.565
I don't need no little shade tree mechanic
running around here.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.536
If you don't know what you're doing,
take my shit to Midas.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.605
I do know what I'm doing.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.205
It's made me come up with great ideas.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.965
- A great idea like what?
- A million-dollar idea.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.325
- A million-dollar idea?
- Yeah.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.164
- With brand-new SUV?
- Brand-new?

22:42.240 --> 22:45.525
It was brand-new when civil rights
movement was going on.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.925
It's a one owner.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.885
One owner? Who was the one owner, Jesus?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.566
Nah, man!
A white lady had it in her garage...

22:51.680 --> 22:53.496
- and never drove it.
- Was it Driving Miss Daisy?

22:53.520 --> 22:55.325
What's that little bolt right there?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.525
- Which one?
- Goddamn mouth.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.056
- What's with you, bro?
- Talking about my shit ain't brand-new.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.242
- Man, you need counseling, bro.
- You do, too.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.765
No, I don't. You do, man.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.000
'Cause I got great ideas.
I'm trying to help you out...

23:06.040 --> 23:07.616
make this situation
better for both of us...

23:07.640 --> 23:09.816
'cause I got this great idea.
Let me tell you about it, man.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.565
All right, hear me out, bro.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.041
Here's what I'm thinking.
These models are notorious...

23:14.160 --> 23:16.322
for having electrical problems
that start fire.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.402
So what I'm thinking
is speeding up the process.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.562
That way, this bitch explodes...

23:20.640 --> 23:21.482
- you feel what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.085
If it explodes...

23:23.160 --> 23:25.205
we get a new model, and a big settlement.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.485
And if I get a big settlement, boom!

23:27.560 --> 23:30.400
So you think you're gonna get a settlement
for blowing up in this truck?

23:30.440 --> 23:32.485
- If I'm in it.
- You're gonna blow up?

23:32.560 --> 23:33.776
I'm not gonna blow all the way up.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.285
I'm not gonna die, that'd be stupid.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.536
All I'm gonna do is just burn
my whole front of my body.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.685
Like you know how Kunta Kinte's back is?

23:39.760 --> 23:42.205
That's how the front
of my chest's gonna look...

23:42.280 --> 23:44.601
Dumb as a box of fucking rocks.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.005
You got a bad bitch now...

23:46.080 --> 23:48.082
No, no, no, no.
And speaking of a bad bitch...

23:48.160 --> 23:50.525
stop fucking with my wife around here.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.523
No, for real. Stop jacking off to her...

23:52.600 --> 23:54.536
- stop watching her.
- Who told you? They snitching on me?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.056
No, she told me.
You've been running around here...

23:56.080 --> 23:57.645
with your little dinkle out and stuff.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.496
- Cut it out!
- Did she tell you she don't like you...

23:59.520 --> 24:00.736
'cause you look like Lionel Richie?

24:00.760 --> 24:02.216
I don't look like no fucking Lionel Richie.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.256
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't look like Lionel Richie.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.696
You gotta look at it from my point of view.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.324
I've been locked up for two years now.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.365
I know. I put money on your fucking books.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.284
So I haven't seen nobody that fine...
I ain't seen no woman.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.245
- All I've been seeing is dick.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

24:15.320 --> 24:16.965
Like, I mean, like, them niggas...

24:17.040 --> 24:19.616
- Them niggas in jail got big-ass dicks.
- I don't wanna hear that shit!

24:19.640 --> 24:21.400
We in shower, they
swinging dick everywhere.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.205
Shit missed and bumped me in my elbow...

24:23.280 --> 24:25.536
- and I was on the other side of the room.
- Okay, enough.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.325
Enough with other men. That too much.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.576
Well, let me fuck your old lady.
I won't talk about 'em no more.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.565
What did I just say about you, Cronut?

24:32.640 --> 24:34.881
You think it's a fucking game.
Stop playing.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.525
- All right.
- We're having a family meeting...

24:37.600 --> 24:38.885
in 10 minutes.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.245
Get my truck, put back the fuck together...

24:41.320 --> 24:43.641
- and get in there on the meeting.
- All right.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.165
Take that black curtain rod off your head.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.816
- No, I got wave caps.
- That ain't a wave cap.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.605
- I'm trying to get waves.
- Them is fingerprints in your head.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.725
No, this is nice waves.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.201
Yes, boss. I's-a getting to it.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.245
Treat me like I'm a goddamn slave.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.526
I'm your peoples!

25:00.480 --> 25:04.280
Now, this is a family
meeting for the Blacks.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.286
Now, I'm a little upset...

25:07.400 --> 25:09.056
that you guys haven't been appreciative...

25:09.080 --> 25:10.764
of this big mansion that I put you in.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.921
You know I'm grateful.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.336
You don't get no more
"gratefu-ker" than me.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.091
Kids, I did all this, guys, for you.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.123
Well, Daddy, we didn't ask for this.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.896
- You need to get Ray Rice.
- Carl, do you see...

25:19.920 --> 25:22.205
- Cronut, shut the fuck up.
- Yes, Your Highness.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.296
I've been trying to get
this Wings and Things account...

25:24.320 --> 25:25.816
so that I can give you
guys a better life...

25:25.840 --> 25:27.965
so I can put some smiling
faces on your face.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.925
All right, how about a smile?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.605
Listen, we are here to have a good time.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.205
No iPhones, no iPads.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.485
- What?
- Put that shit down.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.403
- We're rich...
- Rich.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.125
We're black, and we're going for a walk.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.840
You guys couldn't even walk in Chicago...

25:42.080 --> 25:45.050
- Let's go.
- Listen to what the man's saying!

25:47.120 --> 25:48.485
- You heard Father.
- Let's go.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.965
I got this. Oh, never mind.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.724
I was just...

25:53.560 --> 25:55.449
Damn, this is nice.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.723
We gotta meet some friends around here.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.202
Oh, no, no, no.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.806
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Kim Kardashian.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.922
Not in my neighborhood.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.483
911. The janitor speaking.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.440
Yeah, I'd like to report a suspicious
black family in my gated community.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.685
Give me your address...

26:18.760 --> 26:19.976
They're just walking down the street.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.325
Free for everyone to see.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.801
They probably have weapons
of mass destruction.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.042
The little one looks like an evil overlord.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.336
Can you please send someone, please?

26:27.360 --> 26:29.010
Hello? Hello!

26:30.920 --> 26:32.216
Babe, let's just go back to the house.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.685
They don't wanna walk.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.364
Come on, let's enjoy this.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.681
We in Beverly Hills.
Look how nice this neighborhood is.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.364
Smell the fresh air.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.124
It's nice, right?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.362
- Oh, man, damn.
- This is dumb.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.085
Don't try to take my side either, okay...

26:45.160 --> 26:46.736
because I still don't know you like that.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.364
Hey, hey, hey, watch your mouth now.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.044
Daddy, that's not my mother.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.256
I don't have to listen to her.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.123
My mother died, okay?
That's just your wife.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.856
- Okay, now...
- That's just a side chick that made it.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.644
You're gonna respect your elders now.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.922
- Happy Purge, neighbor.
- The fuck?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.885
Baby, he's got a gun.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.845
- Can I please go back in the house, Dad?
- I'ma pop them legs now.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.365
- Relax.
- What?

27:05.440 --> 27:07.044
That's why I got the switch.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.805
- Welcome, Blacks!
- Hey, hey, hey!

27:09.880 --> 27:12.326
- Why you yelling?
- Oh, you must excuse him.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.920
He gets so excited
when we get to meet new people.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.561
Especially different people.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.685
So welcome to our beautiful neighborhood.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.242
- I am Jim Smith and...
- That makes me Mary Smith.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.164
And we are... the Smiths.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.447
- We come bearing gifts.
- I'll take that.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.482
- You eat this?
- Yeah.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.722
It's little goodies from
Williams and Sonoma.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.565
- So it's food.
- Never mind him.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.765
- He's a little...
- Yeah, special needs.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.649
Oh, I get it.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.485
She's got a brother that's got
special needs, too.

27:43.560 --> 27:44.765
It's okay, little fella.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.842
- That's a nice little guy.
- What the fuck?

27:46.920 --> 27:49.366
Why are you rubbing him
like a yorkie terrier?

27:49.480 --> 27:51.205
He is such a stinker.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.725
It's true, I am.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.405
I did not get your names.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.525
- You are...?
- I'm Lorena.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.284
- Lorena. Latina?
- Yes.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.325
- Un nombre bonito.
- Mucho gracias.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.840
Okay, that's a fucking 'nough, Bill.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.445
- Come on, man, what are you doing?
- Stop flirting, you.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.645
All that neato Telemundo shit.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.765
Why would you want that
when you can have this?

28:09.840 --> 28:12.965
Sweetie, you know I can't resist
a beautiful face.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.805
- Thank you.
- You better put a leash on his ass.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.565
And you are?

28:17.640 --> 28:19.285
My name is Carl Black.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.762
Don't Hate Wiring.
You've probably seen, you know, yeah.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.965
But I also own a new company now.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.441
It's called Mandingo Plumbing...

28:27.520 --> 28:29.284
'cause I lay pipe.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.536
- Carl. Carl, stop.
- I'd like to lay some on your fat ass.

28:31.560 --> 28:34.125
- And I come right after it.
- Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.043
- Okay.
- And look at this.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.327
Are you a little black vampire?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.482
- Stop it.
- It's a little ironic...

28:43.560 --> 28:46.040
that your name is Black...

28:46.160 --> 28:48.083
- because you are...
- Don't say it, bitch.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.084
- Carl!
- No, she know what she's doing.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.400
You moved into the house...

28:52.480 --> 28:54.176
at the end of Cherry
Blossom, is that right?

28:54.200 --> 28:55.325
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.776
Yeah, I'll bet you got a deal on that one.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.724
I did... oh, we did get
a good deal in it, yes.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.002
- Why?
- Well...

29:02.080 --> 29:03.650
Let's just say the last owners...

29:03.760 --> 29:07.125
left in a little bit
of a hurry, mid-renovation.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.085
What the fuck is mid-renovation?

29:09.160 --> 29:10.844
They didn't survive the Purge.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.684
But, you know, I'm sure...

29:12.760 --> 29:14.245
That's the first warning.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.645
- Yes.
- Happy Purge, neighbors.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.324
Happy Purge!

29:55.960 --> 29:57.849
Okay, well...

29:58.800 --> 30:00.643
here's dinner.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.485
- What is that?
- It's chicken.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.244
What, you've never seen chicken, Allie?

30:05.320 --> 30:07.205
- Are you sure?
- The kitchen is brand-new.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.656
There's all those knobs,
and I didn't really know how to put the...

30:09.680 --> 30:10.776
I understand. It looks good.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.723
Yeah, it looks like a vampire chicken...

30:12.800 --> 30:15.724
after the sun comes out.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.447
That better be the sound for the club.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.646
What's with this Purge bullshit, all right?

30:24.760 --> 30:27.764
Oh, my God, Dad.
You don't pay attention to anything.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.320
Tonight's only
the most dangerous night all year.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.045
Yeah, people can get away
with robbing, murdering...

30:33.120 --> 30:35.361
whatever crime they want for 12 hours.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.976
And the police can't do anything about it.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.965
Okay, look.
Enough with this Purge shit, all right?

30:40.040 --> 30:41.365
It's a damn joke.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.171
People don't purge
in no damn neighborhood like this.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.816
Shit, man, I just got out of prison
and here you go with this fuckin' shit.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.976
I didn't come out for this shit.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.565
I'm too old for this shit, man.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.845
- Shit.
- Maybe it was just down the street.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.605
Maybe we should board up
the windows or something.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.405
- Yeah.
- Blacula.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.605
Are you scared?

31:00.680 --> 31:03.081
I thought you was the night
of the walking dead.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.445
I'm the living dead.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.925
The walking dead are zombies.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.016
I think Carl's Jr.'s right.
We need to batten down the hatches.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.202
- You know what I'm saying?
- No, no, no, listen, guys.

31:10.280 --> 31:13.284
I moved you guys to the safest zip code
in the country, all right?

31:13.360 --> 31:15.645
They don't purge in
neighborhoods like this.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.564
Back in Chicago, we couldn't even look
out the windows, remember?

31:18.640 --> 31:21.085
But at least we knew who was coming for us.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.205
Now, we're safe.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.485
This is protection.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.961
This is first class living
right here, all right?

31:26.040 --> 31:28.566
We don't have to worry
about all that crazy stuff.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.163
Oh, shit,
I'd rather be in jail getting fucked.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.049
Fuck this shit. I ain't with this.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.725
They're ready to kill all the blacks.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.245
They are purging for blacks!

31:37.320 --> 31:39.084
- They want the niggas!
- Shut up!

31:39.160 --> 31:42.562
Carl, we need to get everybody
in the car right now...

31:42.640 --> 31:45.005
and drive out of this crazy
neighborhood right now!

31:45.080 --> 31:46.696
Listen, listen, listen. Listen, everybody.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.245
Listen, all right?

31:48.320 --> 31:50.004
Now, we're gonna go to the panic room.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.844
Relax. It's the purge...

31:51.920 --> 31:54.161
but it ain't for us, okay?

31:54.240 --> 31:55.736
- Okay.
- All right, come on, let's go.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.683
Let's move. Let's go.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.776
I thought we weren't
allowed to go out there!

32:00.800 --> 32:02.529
We gotta go!

32:09.520 --> 32:11.170
Thanks.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.362
Does asbestos smell like weed?

32:13.440 --> 32:15.165
'Cause if so, I smell it.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.525
Shut up.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.080
Nothing. You see anything?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.205
Do you see anybody?

32:20.280 --> 32:21.850
- No.
- All right, then.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.884
- What does this button do?
- Stop touching stuff, Junior.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.645
What? I didn't even do anything!

32:27.720 --> 32:30.121
Ever since Mom died,
I can't do anything right.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.085
- Carl's Jr.
- No.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.725
Dad...

32:33.800 --> 32:35.882
that was really messed up.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.644
You know what? I'm going to my room.

32:37.720 --> 32:41.884
And don't anyone come
and check on me, okay?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.962
Not tonight.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.963
They acting like Will Smith's kids now.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.565
Carl, is she hiding something?

32:48.640 --> 32:50.642
- She's spoiled.
- I know.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.245
All right, I'm gonna go check on them.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.970
I'll leave you alone.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.011
Carl's Jr!

32:58.120 --> 32:59.616
Are we in a scene of Diff'rent Strokes?

32:59.640 --> 33:00.936
'Cause that's what it feels right now.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.285
You Mr. Drummond now.

33:02.360 --> 33:04.085
Cuz, just relax, cuz.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.616
They all know you got
a lot of stuff on your mind.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.445
But you know what'll ease that?

33:07.520 --> 33:09.085
Smoke a little ganja.

33:09.160 --> 33:12.369
I got ya. I'm gonna roll up.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.441
Freezee!

33:24.280 --> 33:26.169
You're hot, nigga.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.320
- Not if I kill 'em first.
- Who that?

33:30.360 --> 33:31.441
What?

33:31.520 --> 33:33.284
You gotta go. Who is it?

33:33.360 --> 33:34.765
- Lorena.
- Oh, shit.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.336
My dick hard. Let me
just finish real quick.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.169
Go in my bathroom.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.841
Coming!

33:51.520 --> 33:53.885
- What do you want?
- Well, I wanna talk to you.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.176
- Are you coming in my room now?
- Yeah.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.696
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

33:56.720 --> 33:59.005
- Okay...
- What are you doing?

33:59.080 --> 34:01.003
What do you want?

34:01.080 --> 34:03.162
I don't want anything. I just...

34:03.240 --> 34:04.725
Allie, listen.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.484
I just wanted to come talk to you...

34:06.560 --> 34:08.764
because I am really not happy...

34:08.840 --> 34:10.616
with all this fighting
that's going on between us.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.244
I know I'm not your mother.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.536
- I don't want you to be my mother.
- Trust me, I'm not.

34:14.560 --> 34:15.925
And I will never be your mother...

34:16.000 --> 34:18.161
but I want us to at least
try and be friends.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.719
I don't like all this fighting
that's going on.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.804
It's... It's uncomfortable.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.445
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.085
Look, I brought you a little gift...

34:28.159 --> 34:29.161
a little peace offering.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.480
You brought me something?

34:30.560 --> 34:32.005
My mom gave it to me.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.485
Oh, 'cause you don't got no money.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.324
It's a necklace of the Virgin Mary...

34:36.400 --> 34:38.456
and now I'm giving it to you
to protect you tonight...

34:38.480 --> 34:40.445
for this so-called Purge.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.324
- Thanks.
- You like it?

34:42.400 --> 34:43.965
Yeah.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.724
Okay, how about a thank-you hug?

34:45.800 --> 34:48.326
- Okay.
- Okay, come here.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.283
It's a hug, Allie.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.801
- God!
- Okay.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.844
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.400
Bye! Thank you. Bye.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.736
I'm gonna go talk to your brother.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.922
All right. Okay.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.285
What are you doing?

35:02.360 --> 35:03.720
- I'm coming!
- What are you doing?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.683
Look at how you live.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.762
Oh, my God!

35:07.840 --> 35:09.842
Yo, man.

35:09.960 --> 35:12.440
It's never fucking enough.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.727
Man, it's hard trying
to please this girl...

35:14.840 --> 35:17.923
my family, my cousin, my friends.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.285
I'll tell you right now...

35:19.360 --> 35:21.885
I ain't one of them
'cause I'm proud of you, cuz.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.531
- Yeah?
- With the Wings and Things shit, man.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.776
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Shit, when I was locked up, cuz...

35:26.800 --> 35:29.216
the only thing I could think about
was getting out of Chicago...

35:29.240 --> 35:30.565
and look at us now.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.041
Beverly Hills! Nigga, we made it.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.565
You got all types of shit.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.325
Look at all these lions,
tigers, and bears, oh, my!

35:37.400 --> 35:38.725
- Yeah.
- For real, nigga...

35:38.800 --> 35:40.776
like, are we on "Animal Planet"
in this motherfucker?

35:40.800 --> 35:42.456
You ever watch that channel?
Them motherfuckers be...

35:42.480 --> 35:44.164
You killed all this yourself?

35:44.240 --> 35:46.365
You're doing your thing, man,
but for real, cuz...

35:46.440 --> 35:47.600
I'm telling you, man, like...

35:47.640 --> 35:49.165
you got me out of this shit.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.163
Like, when I grew up,
only thing, you know...

35:51.240 --> 35:53.445
all I've been doing
was robbing, stealing, cheating.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.443
Now I ain't gotta do none
of that shit no more.

35:55.520 --> 35:59.205
And I know, I know your family tripping
off me and everything...

35:59.280 --> 36:01.325
but let me tell you something.
They'll get over it.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.323
The best thing about it...

36:03.400 --> 36:05.528
we 3,000 miles away in Beverly Hills...

36:05.640 --> 36:07.085
from Key Flo's crazy ass.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.322
I do not wanna be around that nigga.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.205
- That nigga is...
- Excuse me. Back up.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.850
Key Flo's out?

36:14.640 --> 36:16.085
Yeah, you ain't know that?

36:17.360 --> 36:19.601
I thought he had about five or six years.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.885
Nope, that nigga's good and out now.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.445
He killing all the witnesses now.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.204
For real, like, he is killing them.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.362
But the crazy part about it...

36:27.440 --> 36:30.085
is the police never found the money...

36:30.160 --> 36:31.445
or they didn't find the weed.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.444
He killed all the witnesses.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.245
Killed them all, man.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.125
You remember that grandma that told on him?

36:38.200 --> 36:39.525
Bitch dead.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.443
Then he killed this preacher.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.045
This preacher was sitting there
riding on a bicycle.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.964
- He shot her 72 times.
- All right, shut the fuck up, man!

36:47.040 --> 36:48.325
I'm trying to tell you a story.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.641
Fuck Key Flo!

36:50.720 --> 36:51.881
All right?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.200
Why? You nervous?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.485
You you should know...

36:54.560 --> 36:56.324
Weren't you with him the day...

36:56.440 --> 36:57.645
the day he got locked up?

36:57.720 --> 36:58.925
You was with him, right?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.616
'Cause you were doing
some installation on...

37:00.640 --> 37:01.801
No!

37:01.880 --> 37:03.882
I'm just saying, I mean...

37:03.960 --> 37:05.200
you're good, though.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.496
We're out here in Beverly Hills.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.170
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with us.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.325
You act like you're with him or something.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.965
Look, I feel, I feel Key Flo...

37:14.040 --> 37:15.605
'cause if that was my shit...

37:15.680 --> 37:18.325
nigga's gotta die. D-E-D.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.125
Die. Dead.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.245
Finito.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.005
Killing everything. Women, kids, grandma.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.805
Lions, tigers, all this shit.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.245
Nigga gotta die.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.685
Nigga's got... It's karma, bro.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.176
If you're gonna take
something from somebody...

37:31.200 --> 37:32.690
- then he's gonna...
- I gotta go.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.442
Spit all on the weed.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.523
Carl's Junior?

37:45.600 --> 37:48.165
- Hey, Lorena.
- Hey.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.685
Oh, this looks cool.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.205
Thanks. It's my vampire lair.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.045
I see that. What are you doing?

37:55.120 --> 37:57.930
I would tell you, but I fear
the NSA will implicate you.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.645
I completely get it.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.245
I get it.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.004
Are you doing okay?

38:04.080 --> 38:07.285
Yeah, it's just that
Dad's always yelling at me.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.284
- And he just makes me mad sometimes.
- You wanna talk about it?

38:11.440 --> 38:12.885
You don't have to be nice to me.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.122
What do you mean "have to"?

38:15.200 --> 38:16.884
I know I'm a weirdo.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.405
My real mom could barely stand
to be around me.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.045
She have birth to me.
All you did was marry my dad.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.565
Okay, listen. Your mom loved you.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.605
I promise you she loved you.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.885
And I, believe it or not...

38:28.960 --> 38:31.405
can totally stand to be around you.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.685
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.364
Well, most of the time.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.085
- Thanks, Lorena.
- All right, listen.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.125
We have a deal, okay?
You don't hide anymore.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.361
We're gonna stick together.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.885
We're gonna be a team, okay?

38:41.960 --> 38:43.724
- Okay.
- All right.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.081
Oh, my God!

38:46.160 --> 38:48.527
Where's my lighter at?

38:53.160 --> 38:54.685
- Hey.
- You got another one of these?

38:54.760 --> 38:56.960
This motherfucker here
don't seem like it wants to work.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.085
Where'd you get that at?

38:59.160 --> 39:00.445
Where'd I get it from?

39:00.520 --> 39:01.885
Yeah, where'd you get my shit at?

39:01.960 --> 39:03.976
Nigga, I see you have
a whole life's supply of this shit...

39:04.000 --> 39:05.764
so I figured I'd help myself, cuz.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.365
What the fuck you talking about?

39:09.880 --> 39:12.008
Oh, God.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.804
No.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.485
What was that?

39:18.560 --> 39:20.927
- What was that?
- I don't know.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.445
Where's the money at?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.325
Is that my dad?

39:25.400 --> 39:27.136
Let's go see
what your crazy father's doing...

39:27.160 --> 39:29.162
- with Cronut.
- Cronut.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.856
'Cause I didn't know if the Purge
was gonna come in here.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.121
I brought you out here.
You're disrespecting my kids.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.804
- Man, come on.
- Messing with my wife.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.416
- Come on, bro.
- You're threatening them.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.408
- Who would threaten...
- You did! You did!

39:38.520 --> 39:40.443
- Get out of here. Get out of here.
- Hey, stop.

39:40.520 --> 39:41.696
Hey, you ain't gonna hit me no more...

39:41.720 --> 39:43.445
with that goddamn bat.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.485
You know I did the two years.
I die by mine.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.125
Know that. Don't hit me no more.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.765
- Okay, well, know this.
- What?

39:48.840 --> 39:51.241
Some kids need their ass spanked...

39:51.320 --> 39:52.924
I think it's the Purge.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.176
I wasn't gonna fuck your old lady.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.245
Boy, ain't no purge
happening in Beverly Hills.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.163
What's that mean?

39:58.240 --> 39:59.696
You know what? I'm just gonna check it out.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.484
- Just stay here, okay?
- I'm sorry!

40:01.560 --> 40:03.244
- Just don't move.
- Okay.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.570
Time to die, everyone. Movie over.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.605
They're gonna purge me, Carl!

40:16.680 --> 40:18.645
Daddy? Daddy!

40:18.720 --> 40:20.536
- You're gonna be sorry!
- Get your ass out of here.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.605
- Dad!
- Carl, that is your family out there.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.001
- Fuck him!
- But tonight's the Purge!

40:25.080 --> 40:26.645
You put out Cronut again?

40:26.720 --> 40:28.445
Yeah, I kicked Cronut's ass out of here.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.124
Y'all gonna defend a damn dude...

40:30.240 --> 40:31.376
- that just got out of prison?
- What?

40:31.400 --> 40:33.285
Let him do some time in Beverly Hills.

40:33.360 --> 40:36.011
- He's gonna die out there.
- I don't give a fuck if he dies.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.845
- R-I-P, Cronut.
- Cronut needs to be inside with us.

40:38.920 --> 40:40.922
It's the Purge! They're crazy.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.096
- Let him back in the house. He's family!
- Move, bitch!

40:43.120 --> 40:45.005
Yeah! What's up?

40:45.080 --> 40:46.730
Yo, what's up, Mr. Frosty?

40:46.840 --> 40:49.002
It's Freezee, nigga!
I'm sick and tired of you.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.096
- What you doing in my house?
- What I was up here doing?

40:51.120 --> 40:53.282
I was making sweet love to your daughter...

40:53.360 --> 40:54.360
making you a grandkid.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.885
With no protection.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.440
John Witherspoon-looking
little motherfucker.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.280
- I'm coming up here.
- Purge on this nigga!

41:01.960 --> 41:03.883
- Run!
- Bitch!

41:03.960 --> 41:05.685
You ready for the Purge?

41:05.760 --> 41:08.161
Allie, what you doing
up there with that boy?

41:08.240 --> 41:10.322
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna purge this nigga.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.131
- Why? He's my family. Stop!
- Shut up!

41:13.240 --> 41:14.725
I'm doing it for you.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.205
I thought you said you loved me.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.204
- I love you. Watch this.
- That's my family!

41:19.280 --> 41:20.485
- Shut up, bitch!
- Daddy, run!

41:20.560 --> 41:22.324
Hey, bitch! Shut up!

41:22.400 --> 41:24.045
- You shut up!
- Shut up!

41:24.120 --> 41:25.804
- No, you shut up!
- Shut up!

41:25.920 --> 41:27.325
- Bitch.
- Freezee!

41:27.400 --> 41:29.164
- Bitch, I'm crazy.
- Stop!

41:34.600 --> 41:36.085
I done... with you.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.285
I knew it. I knew you was crazy!

41:38.360 --> 41:41.245
- Fuck you, Mr. Freeze.
- No! Daddy, hide!

41:41.320 --> 41:43.766
Put the gun down!

41:44.960 --> 41:47.685
- I'm in the studio, bitch!
- Why you doing this?

41:47.760 --> 41:50.684
You told me I was your trap queen!

41:50.760 --> 41:52.091
Oh, shit!

41:56.000 --> 41:58.445
Fuck. Daddy!

41:58.520 --> 42:00.363
I think I killed him!

42:00.440 --> 42:03.405
Oh, my God. Carl, we're going to jail.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.365
No. Allie, you're going to jail.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.245
I don't wanna go to jail!

42:08.320 --> 42:10.965
- Look what you did.
- You told me I was your trap queen!

42:11.040 --> 42:13.245
- Freezee.
- Oh, shit.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.288
- Damn.
- Carl, touch him.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.722
All right, we got a dead
nigga in the house.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.802
- Oh, Carl.
- Okay, now listen.

42:24.880 --> 42:27.685
I watched First 48.
We gotta wipe this house down.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.885
- First 48?
- First 48.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.320
We gotta make sure ain't no more
black people around here...

42:32.360 --> 42:34.965
- 'cause they will snitch.
- Wait, it's the Purge, okay?

42:35.040 --> 42:36.776
It doesn't... we're not gonna
get in trouble, remember?

42:36.800 --> 42:38.605
Yeah, but they'll charge me.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.325
Carl, no. Don't touch him.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.456
- That makes it worse.
- I don't wanna touch him either.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.847
- Carl.
- Roll up, roll his ass up.

42:45.880 --> 42:47.165
- Come on.
- Oh, no!

42:47.240 --> 42:50.005
- How are we gonna...
- I don't wanna touch him!

42:50.080 --> 42:51.570
Shut the fuck up.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.402
Oh, God.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.003
Carl, who is that?

43:02.760 --> 43:04.250
Dad, who is that?

43:08.560 --> 43:10.045
- He's got a chainsaw.
- Who is that?

43:10.120 --> 43:12.521
It's Donald Trump.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.569
I'm just kidding. It's been a while.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.405
Go to the panic room.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.005
I heard you.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.762
- Let's go.
- CJ, come on.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.684
Hello, Carl.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.201
Or should I call you Mr. Black?

43:40.280 --> 43:41.441
How do you know my name?

43:41.520 --> 43:43.124
We know how you can afford...

43:43.200 --> 43:44.685
to live in this neighborhood...

43:44.760 --> 43:47.885
- and you're not welcome.
- You've been Googling my ass?

43:47.960 --> 43:49.644
You're not wanted here, Carl.

43:49.720 --> 43:53.925
We enjoy watching your kind
on the football field...

43:54.000 --> 43:56.970
the basketball courts, and the boxing ring.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.684
But we pay for cable TV...

43:59.760 --> 44:01.565
to see you on our television...

44:01.640 --> 44:04.644
not to live in our neighborhood.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.085
Daddy, I'm scared.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.645
It's a matter of time...

44:07.720 --> 44:10.200
before your wife starts to braid hair...

44:10.280 --> 44:13.725
like Allen Iverson!

44:13.800 --> 44:16.405
Why does he still have the braids?

44:16.480 --> 44:18.687
We like Allen Iverson's braids.

44:18.800 --> 44:19.845
- Yeah.
- We do.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.485
Mr. Black...

44:21.560 --> 44:23.525
it's a matter of time...

44:23.600 --> 44:26.604
before our wives want to sleep with you.

44:26.680 --> 44:29.968
And I do not want you
destroying my wife's guts.

44:31.040 --> 44:32.685
So I must destroy you.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.524
You think I'm scared of you?

44:34.600 --> 44:37.922
We don't want a nigga.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.684
- What?
- What?

44:39.760 --> 44:41.364
You out of your mind?

44:41.440 --> 44:42.521
- Too much?
- Yeah!

44:42.600 --> 44:44.336
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Way too much.

44:44.360 --> 44:45.645
Sorry about that, Carl.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.285
Nah, fuck all that.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.765
No, no, don't be sorry.

44:48.840 --> 44:50.763
Your ass is grass for saying that.

44:50.840 --> 44:53.445
That's on me.
I really wanna apologize for that.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.124
So everything else I meant.

44:55.200 --> 44:58.727
That last part I didn't,
so sorry about that.

44:58.840 --> 44:59.965
Don't... that ain't...

45:00.040 --> 45:01.925
- Put the...
- Dude, just let...

45:02.000 --> 45:04.321
You wanna be sorry?
Get out my motherfucking house.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.285
Tonight, you're being purged
for being a liar, Carl Black...

45:07.360 --> 45:09.965
- and I'm coming in there!
- You can't get in here!

45:10.040 --> 45:10.962
- Yeah.
- Watch, bitch.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.804
It's protected by Viper!

45:12.880 --> 45:15.245
I'm going to cut the power now, Mr. Black.

45:15.320 --> 45:18.925
So it's going to be harder
to see you and your family.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.645
Maybe if you smile...

45:21.720 --> 45:24.451
it would help us find you in the dark.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.405
Fuck.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.890
Fuck.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.163
Jesus. My power tool has run out of gas.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.004
What are the chances?

45:38.080 --> 45:39.445
I'll be back, Mr. Black.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.325
Why is my power tool out of gas?

45:42.400 --> 45:44.801
The Purge is the same time every year,
you two imbeciles.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.683
- I'm scared of the dark.
- What?

45:48.760 --> 45:51.001
How are you a vampire
and scared of the dark?

45:51.080 --> 45:53.805
Vampires are scared of the dark sometimes.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.962
It's just a little thing that goes on.

45:56.040 --> 45:58.122
Don't worry about it. We're on lockdown.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.645
They can't do nothing to us.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.165
They killed the power.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.161
Up with y'all?

46:04.280 --> 46:06.760
What the hell? Where'd you come from?

46:06.840 --> 46:08.805
- I came through the back.
- The back?

46:08.880 --> 46:11.085
What the hell you mean
you came through the back?

46:11.160 --> 46:13.083
- We on lockdown!
- Clearly, we're not.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.416
Man, you got a lot of broke windows
out there in the back.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.696
You need to get that shit checked.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.616
You ain't check that shit on Zillow
before you bought this shit?

46:18.640 --> 46:21.484
Look, if that window's open...

46:21.560 --> 46:23.205
who knows what else is open.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.964
You go check out the front...

46:25.040 --> 46:26.256
and I'ma go check out the back.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.080
Wait, wait, wait,
black people don't split up.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.645
- Yeah.
- We gotta split up tonight.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.205
Girls, y'all stay here.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.964
Come on, let's do it.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.444
All right, guys, listen...

46:37.520 --> 46:40.085
we're gonna be fine
as long as we stay together.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.208
I can't take this anymore. I have to go.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.129
- Carl's Jr!
- God!

46:54.640 --> 46:57.803
The Purge is on, motherfuckers!

47:00.000 --> 47:04.050
- Who's there?
- Welcome to the neighborhood, Blacks!

47:08.640 --> 47:10.802
Hey, hey! They're upstairs!

47:10.880 --> 47:12.644
It's gonna be okay.

47:12.720 --> 47:14.768
Dark is just the opposite of light.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.005
I don't play that shit.

47:17.080 --> 47:19.320
You think you're gonna run me
out of this nice-ass house?

47:19.360 --> 47:21.283
I'm from the hood.
Can't nothing fuck with me.

47:32.360 --> 47:34.601
Once you go black, you die!

47:34.680 --> 47:36.887
Bitch, this is not a game.

47:53.720 --> 47:58.085
Shut the fucking door around here, shit.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.969
Bitch-ass!

48:01.480 --> 48:04.723
Bad night to be a lyin', thievin' runaway.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.685
Key Flo...

48:13.760 --> 48:15.046
what you doin' in L.A., baby?

48:16.360 --> 48:19.603
Crazy shit goin' on out
there tonight, Carl.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.325
You scared, Carl?

48:21.400 --> 48:23.525
No, I ain't scared.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.523
I'm just doing some dishes for my family.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.125
Fuck am I scared, be scared of?

48:29.200 --> 48:30.725
You look real good, Carl.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.564
I appreciate it. I been
drinking my water...

48:32.680 --> 48:34.165
eating cantaloupes, watermelons.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.844
Real good, like a scoop of...

48:35.920 --> 48:38.725
- What the fuck is that?
- Chocolate ice cream.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.845
You know chocolate's my favorite, man.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.245
Well, I'm mocha brown.

48:42.320 --> 48:46.845
Damn, I heard you just got out too, man.
You look good.

48:46.920 --> 48:49.336
They said you was just rollin' around
the neighborhood, man...

48:49.360 --> 48:51.080
and decided you want to stop in my kitchen.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.205
- Yeah, to your kitchen.
- Yeah.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.725
Looks pretty good, marble tables...

48:55.800 --> 48:58.685
- Since we old friends, I need to know...
- Oh, shit.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.603
How much a place like this costs.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.605
Man, you know this ain't really,
like, a real mansion.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.523
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.565
Whatever you paid, it had to be steep.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.605
I got some financial backers, man.

49:10.680 --> 49:14.002
Financial backers? Maybe like Bank Key Flo.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.241
Remember that?

49:16.680 --> 49:19.365
You forgot about how you left Chicago?

49:19.440 --> 49:21.805
With a whole lot of money
and a whole lot of drugs...

49:21.880 --> 49:23.370
that didn't belong to you.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.205
I'm not even gonna bring up
the shit you stole...

49:26.280 --> 49:28.044
- besides that, you know.
- What did I take?

49:28.120 --> 49:30.725
- A space heater.
- I didn't take no damn space heater.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.802
Nigga, you took my space heater, nigga!

49:33.640 --> 49:34.721
That's right.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.804
You took my toilet seat
with the dollar bills on it.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.096
- A toilet seat?
- You know what the fuck I'm talking about!

49:40.120 --> 49:41.765
I don't even like toilet seats!

49:41.840 --> 49:43.245
That's one thing about me.

49:43.320 --> 49:44.725
Guess what?

49:44.800 --> 49:48.885
You gonna get my money and my dope back.

49:48.960 --> 49:49.768
Tonight.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.564
Why are you so angry?

49:51.640 --> 49:53.440
Nigga, you don't need
to worry about all that.

49:53.480 --> 49:55.403
- You know what you need to worry about?
- What?

49:55.480 --> 49:58.085
Is that tonight, I can kill you for free.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.844
- For free?
- For free.

49:59.920 --> 50:02.805
Won't go back to jail.
You'll just be smoked, nigga.

50:02.880 --> 50:04.605
Off the count. You know what I'm saying?

50:04.680 --> 50:08.082
You're gonna give me
all my shit back... tonight.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.845
How did you get out here, on Southwest?

50:10.920 --> 50:13.605
I know you's a funny nigga and all that...

50:13.680 --> 50:15.842
but I ain't in the mood
for no jokes right now.

50:15.920 --> 50:19.402
I know it, and I'm trying to make sure
that me and you don't fall out.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.124
I'm gonna give you your money back.

50:21.200 --> 50:23.202
I got some Mexicans
that's gonna come in town.

50:23.280 --> 50:26.005
They bringing a hundred
of them things in here.

50:26.080 --> 50:28.365
- I'm their connect.
- Who's your connect, nigga?

50:28.440 --> 50:32.240
I will cut your fucking goatee off, nigga!

50:32.320 --> 50:35.605
- Please, don't.
- This not a fucking game.

50:35.680 --> 50:38.205
This is real. This is real, nigga.

50:38.280 --> 50:40.805
You gonna give me all of mine tonight.

50:40.880 --> 50:42.644
And if you don't give me mine...

50:42.720 --> 50:46.685
I'ma have to add some more colors
to my flashy track suit.

50:46.760 --> 50:50.045
Yeah, maybe some red or some brown.

50:50.120 --> 50:53.085
Whoever let you walk out the house
with that jacket is not your friend.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.288
Nigga! This ain't the time
for your goddamn...

50:56.800 --> 51:00.645
I want my money and my dope, nigga.

51:00.720 --> 51:01.881
Tonight.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.282
You wrong, man, 'cause you got busted.

51:06.360 --> 51:09.325
When the police came
looking for you, you left...

51:09.400 --> 51:10.885
and that's when I took the stuff.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.724
The police was gonna get it anyway.

51:12.840 --> 51:15.125
- Hey, baby.
- Carl, you lied to me.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.005
Baby, not right now. Come on.

51:17.080 --> 51:19.401
You have this man in here with a gun...

51:19.480 --> 51:21.365
about to purge us, and you're lying?

51:21.440 --> 51:22.771
No, I didn't, I didn't...

51:25.160 --> 51:27.365
Look, I can't explain
it to you right now...

51:27.440 --> 51:29.200
but I'll explain it to
you later, all right?

51:29.240 --> 51:30.896
Can't catch a break tonight, can you, Carl?

51:30.920 --> 51:32.565
- Daddy, help me!
- I think that's Allie.

51:32.640 --> 51:35.564
That's my daughter right there, man,
they gonna purge me!

51:35.640 --> 51:38.525
I'm purging you, nigga!

51:38.600 --> 51:40.616
- There is no "they."
- Look, man, let me tell you something...

51:40.640 --> 51:42.365
I don't know who the fuck you think I am...

51:42.440 --> 51:44.169
- but I ain't gonna stand for this!
- Shit!

51:48.280 --> 51:49.441
Bitch-ass.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.205
Key Flo?

51:58.280 --> 51:59.725
Key Flo? Key Flo?

52:00.960 --> 52:04.089
Key Flo, you cool? Key Flo?

52:14.120 --> 52:15.565
Bitch, you thought I was gone?

52:16.320 --> 52:18.607
Duck, duck, goose, motherfucker.

52:19.880 --> 52:21.765
Carl Black, bring your bitch-ass out here.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.320
You are light-skinned.
All light-skinned niggas are bitches.

52:27.320 --> 52:29.721
You can't hide!

52:32.960 --> 52:35.167
Lady on my chain, please don't let them...

52:36.840 --> 52:38.565
Daddy, they purgin' us!

52:38.640 --> 52:40.608
Daddy...

52:43.920 --> 52:45.805
You freakin' republican!

52:45.880 --> 52:48.884
Please! Please don't hurt me!

52:48.960 --> 52:50.007
Please!

52:51.200 --> 52:52.645
- Who are you?
- You missed.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.205
- Who are you?
- Bitch.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.521
- What do you want?
- Cut it out.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.925
Dennis Strahan.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.565
But you might know me by another name...

53:03.640 --> 53:04.765
Visa.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.763
- Visa?
- That's right.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.285
And I'm here for Carl Black.

53:09.360 --> 53:13.045
Your deadbeat dad has multiple
cards under multiple names...

53:13.120 --> 53:16.485
buying iPads he can't afford.
I see the Louboutin receipts!

53:16.560 --> 53:18.605
Well, can't he just
take out a loan, or layaway...

53:18.680 --> 53:21.325
Too late for that. The bigwigs decided.

53:21.400 --> 53:23.925
I'm here to take the Black family
off the books.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.285
Tonight!

53:25.360 --> 53:27.362
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

53:27.440 --> 53:29.442
- Yes, you do, little girl.
- No, I don't!

53:29.560 --> 53:30.925
And I'm gonna find him!

53:31.000 --> 53:32.889
Your account is canceled, bitch!

53:35.240 --> 53:36.965
Surprise!

53:37.040 --> 53:39.486
Shut up! Don't you call my girl a bitch!

53:40.640 --> 53:42.324
Fuck you!

53:42.400 --> 53:44.045
You people are all the same.

53:44.120 --> 53:46.043
You want the best brand names...

53:46.160 --> 53:48.640
but do you want to work for it? No!

53:48.720 --> 53:51.405
Well, guess what?
We're the credit card company...

53:51.480 --> 53:54.563
and we own your ass!

53:58.600 --> 54:00.565
Get off of her.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.721
Get off of her!

54:06.720 --> 54:09.405
Is he dead?

54:09.480 --> 54:11.608
I think we killed him.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.643
Take that, motherfucker! Yeah!

54:21.720 --> 54:23.165
Piece of shit!

54:28.760 --> 54:32.685
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

54:37.760 --> 54:41.242
Come to papa.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.965
I'm coming for you, storm troopers.

54:44.040 --> 54:47.522
Carl, stop playing that.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.967
They purgin', bro.

54:52.880 --> 54:54.285
Are you okay?

54:54.360 --> 54:56.245
No!

54:56.320 --> 54:58.525
I thought you said we were safe
in Beverly Hills.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.725
Your father told me the same thing, okay?

55:00.800 --> 55:02.802
Okay.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.723
Allie, did you hear that?

55:11.680 --> 55:13.805
- Daddy!
- Fuck! What y'all doing over here?

55:13.880 --> 55:15.285
You lied to us.

55:15.360 --> 55:17.016
Look, we're gonna talk
about that later, all right?

55:17.040 --> 55:19.122
- When?
- Don't start that shit right now.

55:19.200 --> 55:21.165
- I can't stand you.
- Stop it!

55:21.240 --> 55:24.125
Listen, if anything happens to me...

55:24.200 --> 55:26.565
- I love y'all.
- Stop that shit right now.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.205
You can't hide forever!

55:28.280 --> 55:31.124
- Look, they purgin', all right?
- She killed somebody.

55:31.200 --> 55:34.005
- I did!
- I killed a motherfucker, too!

55:34.080 --> 55:36.242
Listen, where's Carl's Jr?

55:36.320 --> 55:38.322
- We don't know, he's hiding.
- Go find him, Carl.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.605
Oh, man, that's my only son.

55:40.680 --> 55:43.096
- Please get us out of here.
- Isn't this more fun than our anniversary?

55:43.120 --> 55:45.885
- We've gotta go find Carl.
- Let's go. Come on.

55:45.960 --> 55:48.925
- Carl, be careful.
- Come out to play, Webster.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.205
- I ain't fuckin' scared.
- What you talkin' about, Willis?

55:52.280 --> 55:55.841
- I'm scared.
- I'm the man of the fuckin' house.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.496
If the tall one looks like
O.J., I'm gettin' him!

55:57.520 --> 55:59.443
I don't wanna die.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.522
- I love you.
- Don't hold my fuckin' arm so tight.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.364
I'm sorry!

56:08.280 --> 56:10.885
- Carl.
- Go kill it.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.122
Okay, come on, come on.

56:13.200 --> 56:16.204
I'ma blow that do-rag right off 50 Cent.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.485
Slow down, Carl.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.801
See anything?

56:31.400 --> 56:34.802
- What's wrong, son?
- Come here, Carl.

56:34.880 --> 56:37.445
Carl's Jr, come here.

56:37.520 --> 56:39.249
Boy, get your ass over here.

56:41.840 --> 56:42.921
Goddamn!

56:47.320 --> 56:49.402
What the fuck?

56:49.480 --> 56:53.121
Tonight is the Purge, Carl Black.

56:53.200 --> 56:55.965
Wait, where... Where I know you from?

56:56.040 --> 56:57.925
Carl Black, you know me.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.411
You better let my son go!

56:59.520 --> 57:01.085
Not tonight, Carl.

57:01.160 --> 57:04.767
Not tonight.
You have to pay your debt tonight.

57:10.680 --> 57:13.524
- Where do I know you from?
- Got a real short memory, Carl.

57:13.600 --> 57:15.523
- Where do I know you from?
- Shit.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.284
I'm James Clown...

57:17.360 --> 57:20.125
from Clowny Bouncing
House and Party Rentals.

57:20.200 --> 57:22.441
- You know me.
- Oh, yeah, I remember you.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.045
You were at my 10th birthday party.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.849
- That was a really good one, right?
- Yeah!

57:25.960 --> 57:28.376
I really enjoyed that one, too.
They don't give parties like that anymore.

57:28.400 --> 57:29.885
But still!

57:29.960 --> 57:31.256
Nigga, you talkin' about the jumpy houses?

57:31.280 --> 57:34.256
Yeah, I'm talkin' about the jumpy houses
that you rented and never paid me...

57:34.280 --> 57:35.611
and had me there all day.

57:35.720 --> 57:37.961
- I think I do remember this.
- Yes, you remember me...

57:38.040 --> 57:40.202
and tonight you gonna pay
with your narrow ass.

57:41.840 --> 57:43.365
You got the bouncy house,

57:43.480 --> 57:44.720
you got the card trick.

57:44.800 --> 57:47.963
You got the Platinum Party Package deal.

57:48.080 --> 57:50.445
Yes, you got it all, and you never paid.

57:50.520 --> 57:52.645
I got the Platinum Party Package Deal?

57:52.720 --> 57:55.121
You know you got it, Carl Black...

57:55.240 --> 57:56.776
and then you gave me this fake number...

57:56.800 --> 57:59.165
to call you for an invoice,
and there was nothing.

57:59.240 --> 58:02.483
Let me tell you something,
James Clown from the jumpies.

58:03.320 --> 58:05.402
I don't give a fuck where you from.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.403
That's my motherfucking son...

58:07.480 --> 58:09.125
and I'd die for his ass.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.325
- Really?
- Really.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.731
Leg shot!

58:17.320 --> 58:19.056
- I got fired because of you.
- No, no you didn't.

58:19.080 --> 58:20.456
You should have had the damn party...

58:20.480 --> 58:22.456
on the first or the 15th
of the month, that's what.

58:22.480 --> 58:25.802
Goddamn rotten little kids of yours.
They threw pies at me.

58:25.880 --> 58:28.085
I don't know where they get
those goddamn pies.

58:28.160 --> 58:31.084
- Yeah, they ain't worth a damn.
- I never seen a pit bull with a perm.

58:31.160 --> 58:33.605
Your mother's so ugly,
when she turns around...

58:33.680 --> 58:36.336
she make Right Guard make a left,
and make Secret a rumor, motherfucker.

58:36.360 --> 58:39.443
Hey, man, your breath
smell like adult toys.

58:39.520 --> 58:40.760
Motherfucker!

58:45.920 --> 58:47.285
I want my money!

58:47.360 --> 58:50.045
Give me my money now, Carl Black.

58:53.040 --> 58:55.845
Take your motherfucking hands off
my motherfucking cousin, clown.

58:55.920 --> 58:57.524
Don't make me make you my bitch, nigga.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.736
You better recognize and realize.
Better not touch my dog.

58:59.760 --> 59:01.376
Turn around right now
and tell him you sorry...

59:01.400 --> 59:02.816
or I'll beat your motherfucking ass.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.696
I ain't scared to go back to jail, nigga.
I already did two years, nigga.

59:05.720 --> 59:09.122
I know my number by heart.
643586 something, nigga.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.016
- Tell him them numbers.
- Fuck's wrong with you?

59:11.040 --> 59:12.610
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Leg shot.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.920
I ain't even feel it. I ain't even feel it.

59:19.840 --> 59:21.456
Give me my money, you dumb son of a bitch.

59:21.480 --> 59:23.845
You still got pieces of ear in your teeth.

59:23.920 --> 59:26.685
You're a low-down, sucker, fucker, fake...

59:33.440 --> 59:35.044
I'm gonna drill your big-ass head.

59:35.120 --> 59:37.646
No one messes with Cronut's family!

59:37.760 --> 59:39.410
You hear me?

59:44.440 --> 59:46.522
Oh, my God, you killed him!

59:46.600 --> 59:48.523
- He's dead.
- Oh, my gosh!

59:48.600 --> 59:51.885
- Oh, man.
- Shit. They gonna take me back to jail.

59:51.960 --> 59:54.361
- I killed him.
- You done killed Venus Williams.

59:54.440 --> 59:56.408
They gonna take me back to jail, Carl!

59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.365
- Shit.
- Cronut!

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.841
We gotta get out of this house. Come on.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.604
Told you!

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.765
Who can I snitch on this time?

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.645
Oh, shit!

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.365
Carl Black?

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.204
Where you at?

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.566
Where's the keys to the car?

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.040
They're right there on that table.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.645
Got get 'em.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.845
Come on, Carl, man.
I just killed somebody, man.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.205
I'm tired, man.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.725
All that shit you was talking?

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.245
Carl Black? Are you dead, motherfucker?

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.641
Let me protect them. I'll protect them.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.167
- You go and get 'em.
- Yeah! Somebody gonna get purged tonight!

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.284
I got them. I got them. You go get him.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.645
Be careful, Daddy. Be careful.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.565
You stole that money and ran off
to California like I couldn't find you!

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.883
You took Key Flo's money,
and I need it back.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.001
I need that money back...

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.731
I know you was wondering
who was coming down that chimney.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.645
It ain't Santa Claus, bitch.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.802
Ho, ho, merry Christmas.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.765
I'm about to give you peace on Earth...

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.684
'cause I got the pieces
right here, motherfucker.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.125
I came down your chimney,
I had to hold my breath.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.976
All the way down, and do you know
how long I had to hold my stomach in...

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.805
to get through that motherfucker?

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.765
Up on the rooftop Click, click, click

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.605
I'm 'bout to shoot off Carl Black's dick

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.565
Where you at, bitch?

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.005
- Where you at?
- I don't even know you, man.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.208
I see you, motherfucker.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.845
Remember me?
I'm your parole officer, bitch...

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.965
and I'm your P.O...

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.645
who is pissed the fuck off.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.210
Fuck you!

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.968
- Y'all run!
- You stole from Key Flo.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.002
Your mama snitched on you.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.856
It's easy to get something
out of your mama...

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.089
when I gave her some Hennessey
and some of this dick!

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.805
If I throw a cheeseburger on the ground...

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.087
you've got to make a decision, big boy!

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.447
I got the keys, fat motherfucker.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.205
Fuck you callin' me fat?

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:19.125
Yeah, I was just playing
with you, Carl Black.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.841
Thinking about sending your punk ass
to jail, make you somebody's bitch.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.604
You my bitch!

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.325
Now I got these infrared beams out, pimp...

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.641
and they never miss.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.925
Hey, Carl Black, consider your ass...

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.843
purged!

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.322
I thought he shot me.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.364
Shit. It's a fuckin' cardboard box.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.681
What the fuck?

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.771
God is good.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.045
Precious is dead down here!

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.245
We killed Shamu!

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.243
Carl Black, you punk bitch...

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.288
I told you I'd be back.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.964
Nigga, where are you? I
will fuck your wife.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.321
Daddy!

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.805
- Carl!
- Take that thing off.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.484
They tried to kill me downstairs.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.767
- They're trying to kill all of us, man.
- For real.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.525
Why'd you leave him down there alone?

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.656
Somebody had to be there to protect y'all.
I'd die for y'all.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.885
I'm here for you, and you!

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.525
Okay, okay, listen, listen.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.656
We got to get downstairs
and we got to get in that truck...

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.280
and get the fuck out of here, all right?

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.965
- Now.
- Let's go, man, you right.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.565
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I need my weed and I need my money.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.765
I promise I'ma give you everything
as soon as we get out of here.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.445
You better.
Junior, come out from up under there.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.931
- Come on, baby.
- Junior!

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:13.886
I'm not the one you want!
You want Carl Black!

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.285
Saw someone run down the hall.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.761
Cronut, Cronut, Cronut!

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.565
- Damn!
- Cronut, God damn.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.005
Are we just gonna leave him in there?

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.481
They got him.
That mean they got my damn money.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.765
Cronut's going to little man heaven.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.285
Daddy, now is not the time.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.442
They took his do-rag off.
You know he balded.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.885
Oh, no.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.406
Feels like we in a goddamn horror movie.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.965
- Okay, now, what's the rules?
- What are the rules?

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.963
- What rules?
- The scary movie rules.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.765
Yeah, horror movie rules.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.045
We gotta do the shit
that white people don't do.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.884
- Survive?
- No.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.896
Let's get out of here quicker
than a cat can lick its ass.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.805
Carl Black?

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.525
I came to purge you.
Come on, you bitch-ass nigga!

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.805
I'm going to blow-dart your ass.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.680
Scary movie, scary movie. Texas Chainsaw...

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.965
- Friday the 13th...
- Gonna get you, suckers.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.646
- No...
- Carl's Jr., you're not helping.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.841
I'm trying.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.365
Okay, Halloween, Laurie Strode...

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.565
Jamie Lee Curtis, in her breakout role.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.325
- Escapes from Michael Myers.
- What does she do?

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.801
She stabs him in the eye
and pushes him out the window.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.042
Come on out, Sofia Vergara.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.964
Of course, he's not dead.
He comes back again and again and again,

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.645
becoming an undead killing machine.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.961
So, basically, what I'm saying
is, we're going to die.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.565
- We're all going to die.
- You gonna die! If you keep talking!

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.456
- Just talking about scary...
- Shut up! Who got a belt?

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.845
Okay, okay! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.082
I'll tear your ass up
in the middle of this purge.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.445
- Can't run from us now!
- Quit trying to help!

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.841
Smells like black chicken.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.645
I'm gonna go get the black one!

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.644
- Told you.
- You can't hide forever!

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.281
Carl's Jr!

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.761
Carl!

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.842
I'm just gonna go get him, okay?

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.245
All right.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.885
Look, this is my fault.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.176
When I came with all them scams
and all that different stuff.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.521
I was just trying to give my family
a better life, okay?

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.725
- I know.
- And now people getting killed and shit.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.964
- Damn.
- Come out, come out wherever you are!

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.600
I hope you forgive me.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.205
I forgive you for it.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.725
I love you.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.605
You lied, Mr. Black...

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.965
- so I'm here to purge you, Carl.
- Go, go, go, go.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.884
Carl, careful.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.165
If you want me, come and get me.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.641
Carl, you lied to me on your application!

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.246
Nobody has a credit score of 45,000!

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.765
Carl, your family and
you don't belong here.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.565
I invited some of your
friends from Chicago.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.483
Turns out you owe everyone money.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.564
- Why you doing this to me?
- You were born.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.765
We don't want you
in this neighborhood, Willis.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.322
Next thing you know,
try to buy my son some Air Jordans...

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.725
they're gone.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.405
Now my son's gotta wear New Balance.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.445
Then your kids...

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.565
are gonna wanna have sex with my kids...

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.845
and we got a bunch of kids...

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.161
Paula Pattons
running around the neighborhood.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.924
Man, fuck Nick Cannon!

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.923
What's Nick Cannon got
to do with this shit?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.241
I don't know! I'm rambling.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.842
I have never been inside this home.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.125
The crown molding is amazing.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.325
This would be a great house to live in.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.086
Or a great house to die in!

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.009
Tell you what, Carl.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.845
Consider this home a swamp...

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.205
and I'm the alligator.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.521
Chomp, chomp.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.570
About to bite that ass.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.162
Han Solo's dead.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.163
Spoiler alert.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.561
The little one, he escaped!

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.685
We have to find him now...

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.444
that little Kevin Hart.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.725
Weird, cap-looking bitch.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.801
One down, five to go.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.004
Carl's Jr?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.604
Carl's Jr.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.325
Carl's Jr.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.763
- Damn it.
- Okay.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.649
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.205
Allie, stop crying, okay?

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.725
Nobody's gonna kill us, okay?

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.685
We are not gonna get purged in here.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.285
We are the Blacks, do you understand?

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.564
- Who are we?
- We're the Blacks.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.285
- Okay.
- Is this 911?

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.564
No, 211.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.243
Yes, my name...

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:21.564
My name is Carl Lawrence Black.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.205
Stop breathing so hard, motherfucker.

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.611
I'm not selling ass.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.041
We have to go into the shower...

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.484
together.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.845
I don't wanna be gay.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.365
Not like that.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.604
- You go first.
- You go first.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.001
- He's your brother.
- This is your house.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.081
Fine.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.285
I need you to send some help
over here right now...

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.925
'cause if you don't, I'ma kill myself!

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.001
Well, nigga, go ahead!

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.524
Kill yourself. I don't give a fuck.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.886
Allie, look at me. We can do this, okay?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.480
We're not gonna die here, all right?

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.605
- You really do love us, Lorena.
- Of course I do.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.728
What do you think I'm doing
all this crazy shit for?

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.645
- I thought you was a ho.
- God.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.324
All right.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.566
Allie.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.485
All right, one, point the light that way...

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.800
- Okay.
- And let's go.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.484
Okay.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.605
Okay.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.841
All right, let's go.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.763
Man, I'm a black man in Beverly Hills.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.736
- I got a 310 number.
- Nigga, you don't move your black ass...

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.365

They're gonna fuck you up, man!

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.085
Get out, nigga!

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.400
Hello?

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.483
Hello!

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.721
Hello?

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.525
Hey!

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.045
- Hey!
- Shit.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.521
I'm gonna purge your ass tonight, yeah.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.523
Gonna purge your ass tonight.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.250
Gonna purge your...

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.242
What y'all bitches doing
in my mansion on purge night?

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.722
- Your mansion?
- Did I stutter?

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.040
My mansion!

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.005
If you're here, okay,
to purge my husband Carl...

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.525
Your husband?

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.841
Carl, your husband?

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.365
Baby, I could write a book...

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.680
on the shit you don't know.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.285
- Allie, who is this?
- I don't know.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.805
Talk to Shoranda. I'm listening.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.445
We don't know who you are, bitch.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:48.845
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.205
- Shut the fuck up!
- She has a cleaver!

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.925
I will chop them fucking brains out, bitch.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.525
Okay, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.725
Miss, what do you want?

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.041
I came to get my husband back...

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.724
Carl Black.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.445
- Your husband?
- Yes.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.364
My husband that you stole from me.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.522
He belongs to Shoranda.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.805
Shoranda Black, bitch.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.723
Oh, my God, I do remember her.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.451
- From where?
- She gave my daddy a ride...

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.085
and he got a restraining order against her.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.083
And I made that fool a pie.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.485
He doesn't like pie.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.445
He loves this pie, boo.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.485
- Hey!
- She's a stalker.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.965
Don't play with me.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.565
I will slit your fucking throat.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.404
Hey!

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.562
Let's purge, bitch.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.845
Lorena!

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.600
Stop it!

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.965
Girl, he's not your man.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.122
He's a liar, but he's my liar.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.362
He's my liar, too, bitch!

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.129
- Big Shoranda.
- Slam it over her head.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.925
Fuck it...

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.604
You done hit me on my goddamn back!

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.842
Carl's Jr! Oh, my gosh.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.604
You did it. You did it!

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.125
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I was hiding over there, Mom.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.362
- You called me mom.
- Yeah, is that okay?

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.925
Yes.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.445
- Oh, my God. Allie, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.602
- Thank you, Lorena.
- You're welcome.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.967
All right, listen, guys.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.605
We have to go out there...

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.842
Why are you taking your shirt off?

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.645
And get your dad, okay?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.644
- No more hiding, Junior, okay?
- Okay, okay.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.365
All right, let's stick together, okay?

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.521
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.364
- Let's go.
- You did it, Blacula.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.647
- Crazy bitch.
- Hey!

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.045
We gotta get out of this house.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.770
We gotta get out of here!

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.365
Carl, come on, man. Come out!

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.165
In another neighborhood,
we could've been friends.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.322
I saw Django.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.842
I was glad Jamie Foxx
killed all those people.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.685
I would've never put your wife in a box...

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.205
in the backyard.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.405
That was bullshit.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.811
Fuckers.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.044
- White power.
- White power.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.522
You motherfuckers think
you can come here on Purge night?

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.683
Welcome to the Beverly Hills
Ku Klux Klan, motherfuckers.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.121
Amen!

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.043
You think you can come
into my neighborhood...

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.325
straight out of Compton...

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.323
waving your hands in the
motherfucking air...

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.885
like you just don't care...

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.285
This look like the Oscars.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.964
Oh, my God.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.656
- You guys are about to die!
- Please, white nigga.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.136
- Please take me with you, please.
- No.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.765
- I want the same outfit.
- I got a chair right here...

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.683
waiting for your friend, Mr. Carl Black.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.603
Yeah, motherfucker.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.965
I'm in the Klan, too.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.042
White nigga, listen to me.
I'm on your side.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.456
I will take one of them sheets
right now and work with you...

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.656
and kill these niggas together.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.176
Please don't kill us both. Just kill him.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.616
He's the reason why we're even in America.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.336
- White power.
- We wouldn't have been on that boat...

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.656
- if it wasn't for him.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.416
- White power.
- How do you think they got here?

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.256
My great-grandfather
sold these niggas to y'all.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.496
- White power.
- They also brought Ebola.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.965
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you, you "10 cents a day."

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.845
- You guys are confusing me!
- Fuck you!

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.045
- White power!
- Where the fuck is Larry?

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.804
- Please.
- White power.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.656
- Larry, where the fuck have you been?
- White power.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.364
Tom, this is a black!

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.044
- What the hell?
- Yeah!

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.925
- White power.
- I am black.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.725
Carl Black.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.485
Take that now. Yeah. Yeah!

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.085
Get on the ground with that.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.256
- White power!
- White power!

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.645
You want some of this shit, too?

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.290
Oh, damn!

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.816
- What the fuck is this?
- White power.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.605
- Looks like an M&M.
- Big, black nigga dicks...

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.761
and big, black balls.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.365
- Hey!
- Big, wide, juicy white pussy.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.601
- Damn!
- What the fuck?

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.125
- God damn it.
- What the fuck...?

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.645
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.040
- You see anything?
- Let's get out ofhere!

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.560
- All right, guys.
- Are we gonna die?

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.805
No, baby.
We're just gonna go find your father.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.644
We have to go downstairs, though, okay?

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.285
I wanna go home.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.805
- Allie, I know, baby.
- Where are we going?

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.803
We have to go downstairs
and find your father.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.765
- Downstairs?
- We can't go downstairs!

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.365
Guys, we have to. Come on, come on.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.805
Let's go, fast.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.405
Come on.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.161
Carl!

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.651
Okay, come on.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.850
Carl!

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.645
- Oh, my God.
- Hey!

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.688
I never thought I'd say this,
but I missed y'all.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.280
- You're still alive, Cronut.
- Yeah, I'm here.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.165
Listen, is everybody all right?

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.045
Yeah, I helped Lorena kick some ass.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.725
I'm proud of you, man.
Listen, we gotta get out to that garage...

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.165
and get in that car and get
the fuck away from here.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.402
- I'm ready.
- Okay. Cronut, calm down.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.125
Slowly.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.248
- Carl?
- There's people all over the place.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.805
I didn't know you were black.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.776
I should've known
when you gave me the deposit...

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.925
in a Crown Royal bag.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.205
Come on, let's just talk.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.009
This house is too big.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.203
You guys are acting like you're
the Jackson 5 or something.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.923
- You got the keys?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.604
Cool, player.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.085
Hey, man, if I die...

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.445
I'ma just give you all my money.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.936
- It's all in the will for you.
- You ain't got no fucking money.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.246
The fuck?

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.440
What was that?

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.164
What? What, you hear something?

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.045
I think that's the "xactlies."

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.925
What's the "xactlies"?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.445
Your breath smells exactly like your ass.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.565
Carl.

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.881
Stop blowing on my neck.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.007
Stop.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.525
Go, go.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.685
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.450
Come on. Get in the truck.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.323
Oh, shit.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.365
- Put your seatbelts on.
- Put your seatbelt on.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.325
Let's go.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.285
- Drive, drive, drive.
- Put your seatbelt on.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.521
What the...?

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.920
Hey, hey! Be quiet!

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.244
Hey, hey!

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.845
You leave the keys in the car...

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.160
and get your ass out.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.924
Man, get your ass out of my car!

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.365
Ain't no goddamn way.
They're purging like crazy out there.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.005
I've just seen a dog on its hind legs
walking a human!

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.481
Listen, I can't believe I got
a crackhead in our car...

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.376
- from Beverly Hills.
- A crackhead? Look at me.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.084
Do I look dressed like a crackhead to you?

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.205
I'm the damn repo man!

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.485
The repo man?

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.324
- Yeah, I...
- You just keep lying.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.561
Don't nobody get no car...

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.285
from Big Little Jimmy's
Auto Shop and not pay!

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.325
- Get your ass back.
- Your eyes is amazing.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.448
Hey, hey, hey! Stop complimenting me!

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.736
He looks real cute in the face.

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.683
Hey!

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.683
- Don't look at me.
- I can't see. I'm blind.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.285
Had you paid your damn payments...

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.560
then maybe I wouldn't be here
right now on Purge night!

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.680
- Get your ass out of here.
- I'ma make my payments, man.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.216
No, no, no. You're not gonna make 'em.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.481
Everybody's gonna pay
with a gun in their face.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.925
When I'm like this, everybody's paying.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.162
Can I just give you a money order?

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.365
On Purge night? Get out the car!

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.645
I done told you four times.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.721
- Get out!
- Okay, okay.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.160
All that shit! Get out!

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.736
- Get your ass out of here.
- All right, all right!

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.842
Call me.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.161
You could've refinanced, man.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.965
Listen, man, I'm a great devoted dad.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.123
- I see that.
- And I got this house out here...

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.885
because I wanted to give
a better life for my family.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.724
- I know, man.
- But I'm black...

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.280
and I won't even let the boogeyman
run me out of my shit.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.525
Okay?

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.204
It's a purge going on...

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.044
and we don't need this.

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.360
We're trying to stick together.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.243
Why come you can't come with us, man?

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.924
You look like Vanessa Williams, bro.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.840
I know, man.
I sat in this motherfucking car...

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.616
and I've been thinking like,
"Why am I not a the house?

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.085
- Why am I not in a house?"
- You're a nice guy, man.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.240
I started doing all the math,
and I thought about it.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.125
It's 'cause motherfuckers
like you don't pay shit.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.816
Therefore, I can't buy no house like this.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.256
I gotta always chase a motherfucker down...

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.016
and tonight, on Purge
night of all nights...

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.405
they give me the slip?

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.005
Me? All the white motherfuckers...

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.816
that work there,
and they gave it to the mixed nigga?

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.525
Why? 'Cause they thought
I might almost kill your ass.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.776
But tonight, I'll do it, motherfucker.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.376
I got a couple hours left, and I will
shoot you in your motherfucking face.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.896
They killed my grandparents tonight, man.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.205
They made them kill each other
with plastic spoons.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.176
They made them kill each other
with plastic spoons!

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.168
- Get out.
- All right.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.245
Get out slowly.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.536
- I'ma pay with your ass in a minute.
- Can I get out this way?

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.936
Hell no, you know you
can't get out this way.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.165
Slick-ass niggas.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.525
Damn, man.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.364
Got me out here on Purge night.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.976
Telling me all you got
with your family problems.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.445
I got family problems, too!

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.760
This is impolite as hell, too.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.524
You knew goddamn well I'm gonna this car.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.640
I'll shoot little Dracula.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.125
- No, don't do it!
- Shoot little Dracula, hell yeah!

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.282
No one dance to this shit.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.567
Pay your bills, I wouldn't be here, man!

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.444
God damn it, don't you try nothing.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.284
I hate to do this to you, man.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.176
Looked like you were capable
of paying them notes.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.976
Looked like you could've did
if you believed in yourself.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.049
Could still see your ass in the rearview.
Don't try no slick shit.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.805
'Cause don't you try shit.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:52.207
Don't you try shit.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.361
What's that noise?

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.165
Shit, I got balls.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.525
I got balls, homie!

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.001
I got balls, homie.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.605
Yeah, boom! Yeah.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.485
Just like Paris Hilton did back in the day.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.685
Turn it, turn it.

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.560
I know the dance move.
I know the dance move.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.216
I know the dance move. I know the dance...

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.045
Oh, but turn it around. Look out.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.485
Get ready! Do-rag!

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.365
- Gonna kill you first.
- Get back, get back!

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.761
I told you I'd get you
sooner or later, Carl.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.884
- Any last words?
- Yeah, why does your voice keep changing?

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.450
I'm just working on different shit.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.085
Jim! Mary!

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.365
- Hey, Larry.
- Larry.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.645
- What are you guys doing here?
- Happy Purge.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.882
Yeah, you guys brought
the guns and the vests...

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.803
and the bullets, the shot...

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.285
That's a good look on you, Mary.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.856
Just don't give me them bedroom eyes...

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.845
or I'm gonna have to purge Jim.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.176
I'm just fucking with you.
Hey, that thing got a laser on it?

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.363
Yeah! Mary got this online for me
at the pre-Purge sale.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.602
- Thank you, baby.
- Thank you.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.125
Larry, here's the thing.
You're the worst president...

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.485
this Home Owner's Association's ever had.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.525
It was you who filled
out that application...

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.245
- and accepted it, right?
- What?

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.322
I didn't know they were a black family.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.205
How can you not know that?

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.647
Did you see their car?
Did you see their rims?

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.656
I was doing the paperwork.
I looked down, I just saw "Blacks"

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.405
Thought it was, like Jack Black.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.403
We're gonna have to go back
to a two-term limit.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.045
- Larry, it's disappointing, man.
- Absolutely.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.043
You guys are so sensitive.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.645
Tell you what. I'ma cut Carl up.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.802
- You guys get the rest of the family.
- Carl, no!

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.005
- We can do that.
- Yeah.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.560
Let's purge. We're gonna
do a black family...

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.847
whose name's Black. It's twofer.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.844
- Hey, Carl.
- No, no. Come on, come on.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.765
Shot me in the back!

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.081
I'm gonna need a wine cooler and you.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.241
I thought we were friends.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.605
Jim and Mary, thank you so much.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.045
Thank you.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.245
- You're welcome.
- Hello, Blacks.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.125
- Hey!
- Just got one more thing for you.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.605
- What?
- What?

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.245
As the...

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.045
I guess I'm the new president
of the Home Owner's Association.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.405
Let me just say you have no business
in this neighborhood.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.125
- Excuse me?
- Once a hood rat...

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.725
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.285
Always a hood rat.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.245
You're the guys that brought us
a gift basket.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.605
Yeah, we did.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.284
We give them to everybody.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.925
I told you they don't like black folks
in this neighborhood, man.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.288
And now we're gonna serve you up
your eviction notice, brother.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.165
Damn!

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.607
They are killing like shit around here!

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.605
Jorge...

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.241
neighborhood watch, saves the day.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.605
- Not again. Come on.
- No, it's Jorge.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.336
Baby, look, I told you my people are good.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.681
Gracias, Jorge. Gracias. Besito, mi amor.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.967
Well, I couldn't let them have all the fun.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.285
Oh, God!

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.164
- Dang it!
- Hold up, man. It's 7:01.

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.896
- The Purge is over.
- Yeah, the Purge is over.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.524
I don't give a shit what time it is.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.126
For me, there's only one time.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.722
- Oh, man! Just...
- And it's time to take out the Blacks.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.205
Okay, now, listen, man...

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.725
enough is enough.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.005
- You're gonna kill us?
- Fuck it.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.570
Let me pray with my family.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.885
Do what you gotta do...

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.525
and when you're down
there, take care of me.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.204
I'll wait.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.805
Come on.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.325
Let me pray with my family.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.685
Everybody get over here.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.330
Dear heavenly Father...

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.087
Motherfucker!

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.486
Oh, shit!

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.685
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.842
He might not be dead.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.160
- No, he dead.
- He's dead?

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.287
He's gone.

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.045
You did it!

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.085
- Daddy.
- Babe.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.285
My family, I love y'all.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.085
I know I done made a whole lot
of mistakes in my life...

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.725
but if there's one thing
we learned today...

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.404
it's that we all love each other...

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.084
and we stick with each other, okay?

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.084
And, Allie, I'm proud of you.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.164
But I want you to leave guys
like Mr. Freezee alone.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.256
You're a real woman.
You need something better than that.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.925
- All right, Dad.
- Junior...

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.805
you can be anything you want in life.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.605
- Just don't be like your daddy.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.965
And, baby, I love you.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.445
I love you, baby. Thank you.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.565
- I'm over here.
- Cronut.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.085
- What's up, boy?
- I need my money from you, man.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.336
I got you. I'm gonna go get it right now.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.442
But you ain't got nothing
positive about me?

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.125
I like how you blew Sinbad up in that damn.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.456
I told you, man, it's gonna work.
You gotta put more trust in your boy.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.525
I just ain't get the settlement,
but you're good.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.805
- You got your bread.
- Yeah, well, go get it.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.042
I'm gonna get... All right, I got it.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.043
Don't purge your boy.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.201
Yeah, man, I'm...

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.123
You know, Daddy made
a whole lot of mistakes...

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.565
but there's one thing about me.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.563
I love my family.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.896
- I love us, too.
- Love you, baby.

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.965
We gotta pack our shit up and get
the fuck out of Beverly Hills.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.605
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'm with you.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.923
Black family!

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.844
Boom, selfie! Nigga, we made it.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.644
So we survived the night...

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.245
and I learned some valuable lessons.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.005
Always handle your
business the right way...

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.645
'cause fools be trippin'.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.405
Never deal with racist homeowners.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.403
And the most important lesson...

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:45.324
nothing is more important than family.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.607
I'm still alive, nigga.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.931
Winter's coming.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.925
This is it.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.525
Our new home.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.405
This is our own cabin.

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.045
- It's gonna be great.
- There it is.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.525
New beginnings.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.645
- It's so beautiful.
- It is, right?

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.724
We can make s'mores and stuff
like white people.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.565
- It's gonna be fun.
- I'm bringing all my bitches here, too.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.365
Shut up.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.887
- It's gonna be great.
- Carl Black done escaped the Purge?

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.171
We beat the Purge. Black family!

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.642
Jason Voorhees?

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.482
I'ma drop a dime on Jason Voorhees.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.043
I don't like that shit.
