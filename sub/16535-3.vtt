Oh, my God, you're
checking the label.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.048
- [chuckles]

00:14.082 --> 00:16.149
- Dad, look,

00:16.184 --> 00:19.587
a girl her age
dating a guy your age?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.489
I'm sorry,
she smells money.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.391
- There's nothing left to smell.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.393
- Well, then she's in
for a shock because

00:25.426 --> 00:28.262
for a guy who's broke,
you live real good.

00:28.296 --> 00:31.399

00:31.432 --> 00:32.833
- We're good.
We're solid.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.103
There is a lot of trust there.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.437
- That's a loaded description.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.140
- Hey, Mom only
didn't trust you

00:39.173 --> 00:42.543

and ears.

Go figure.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.556
Daddy, this Natalie thing,

00:55.589 --> 00:59.127
all I'm saying is,
be careful, okay?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.594
- You should be
warning her.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.397
- If I had her number,
I would.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.100

from the district.

where she went.

been with another guy?

have you known Trudy?

I don't know.

Don't know his name.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.878
She said she was
gonna handle it.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.346
I should have done something.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.881
- No.
Hey.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.883
That's not your job.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.886
We got this.

- C--
- Yeah, come on.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.857

this block inside out.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.397
I want every single
resident accounted for.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.131
No one leaves until it's done.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.966
One of ours is
in the hospital.

Let's go get some answers.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.070

she was lying there,

05:39.440 --> 05:40.874
I told my wife to call 911.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.976
Then you guys showed up.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.078
Did you guys need me to come
down and make a statement?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.381
- Tell us what you saw.
No detail's too small.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.082
- Yeah.
I didn't see the guy.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.484
I-I heard a car peel out.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.019
- Uh-huh.
- It was definitely a V-8.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.521
It sounded vintage.

I collect.

05:54.722 --> 05:55.723
Anyway, I came out.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.090
Your officer triggered
the car alarm.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.926
It was, uh, 10:20.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.160
- How did you know
she was police?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.161
- She said she was,

06:01.194 --> 06:02.730
you know,
before she passed out.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.032
She tried to defend herself,
or I assume she did,

06:05.065 --> 06:07.034
but the guy took her gun.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.436
- We're gonna need to
get this in writing.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.703
You can do it
from your house.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.505
Officer?
- Yeah.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.909
- Okay, all right.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.811
The guy left her purse,

06:17.845 --> 06:20.548
didn't take her watch.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.115
I got Sergeant Hayes
from Violent Crimes

06:22.149 --> 06:24.718
running all recent parolees
with robbery backgrounds,

06:24.752 --> 06:27.821
convicted felons
who live in this sector.

06:27.855 --> 06:31.124
I don't know,
what do you think?

06:31.158 --> 06:34.027
Al.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.396
- He only took her gun.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.903
- I need all you
to report for canvassing

06:42.936 --> 06:45.138
to Detective Dawson
up on Webster Street.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.840
Let's move.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.843
Burgess, I need you
catching in-service calls

06:49.877 --> 06:51.111
at the south end
of the district.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.580
- Sir, shouldn't I help
on the canvass?

06:52.613 --> 06:53.881
- Intelligence has Platt's case.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.015
I already got five cars
down on that job.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.083
- Excuse me?
- Will you hang on

06:56.116 --> 06:57.017
just a minute?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.152
And we got a big city
we need to deal with.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.589
I got to take this.
Hang on.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.823
- Adam.
- Hey.

07:02.856 --> 07:03.891
- What do we know?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.025
- Uh, not much yet.

07:05.058 --> 07:05.893
Voight's got us
onto something,

07:05.926 --> 07:08.829
but he thinks
that Platt was targeted.

07:08.862 --> 07:09.963
- Is there anything
I can do to help?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.599
- Yeah, we can use more hands.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.800
Come on.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.102
- All right, yeah.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.175
- I don't think
this was a random attack.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.878
These are CRs filed
against Platt.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.781
The top two are lawsuits
she's racked up.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.950
We think she knows
her assailant.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.053
A guy came in the district
last week, made threats.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.589
I want to know why,
and I want to know who,

07:35.623 --> 07:37.090
and fast.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.225
- Sergeant,

07:38.258 --> 07:40.561
you know we got those new
cameras installed downstairs?

07:40.594 --> 07:41.629
- We do?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.063
- Yeah,
it's a new security measure,

07:43.096 --> 07:44.164
so if the guy was a walk-in...

07:44.197 --> 07:46.133
- I'll contact OEMC,
get access.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.835
Meantime, every page.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.269
- Yeah.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.171
- If you don't have any
lawsuits filed against you,

07:51.204 --> 07:52.172
you're a fake-ass cop.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.909
- Well, in that case,
Platt's real as hell.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.581
Bad joke.
Let's dive in.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.574

these are all Platt's shifts

08:26.607 --> 08:29.577
since the cameras went in.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.978
That's me walking in
right there.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.613
- We see that.
- Adam, faster.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.081
- You got it, yeah, yeah.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.083
*

08:37.116 --> 08:39.086
- Wait, what's that?

08:39.119 --> 08:43.256
*

08:43.289 --> 08:44.858
That's Malik.

08:44.892 --> 08:45.959
- Who?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.160
- He runs the liquor store
on 22nd.

Let's go.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.631
[door bell chimes]
Yo, Malik.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.265
You threatening cops, huh?

08:52.299 --> 08:55.569
- Can I help you, Officer?

08:55.603 --> 08:57.070
- Come out here.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.607
- I ain't got to
consent to that.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.010
- [clears throat]

09:03.043 --> 09:05.312
- We gotta ask you
a couple of questions, dog.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.014
[lock latches]

09:07.047 --> 09:08.248
- I got two more units
in the back.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.917
Try and run.

09:09.950 --> 09:16.323
*

09:17.324 --> 09:18.626
- Y'all got body cameras on?

09:18.659 --> 09:19.660
- Nope.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.361
Not us.
- [sighs]

09:21.394 --> 09:23.296
- Where were you tonight,
Malik?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.633
- I was here, all night.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.767
I got here at 8:00,
and I haven't left.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.970
- Who's gonna back you up?
- How about your Sergeant?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.204
- Hell you trying to say?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.974
- You work for
Sergeant Platt, right?

09:34.007 --> 09:36.309
She came in, she walked
my nephew out to the car.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.079
Tonight's when we do
our cash runs.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.313
We go collect
from my other shops,

09:40.347 --> 09:42.983
but we've been robbed twice.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.085
- Okay, well,
I'm confused because

09:45.118 --> 09:47.320
you were just in our district,
making threats.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.922
- We supposed to get
more patrol on the block

09:48.956 --> 09:50.624
but budget cuts
or whatever.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.661
Look, she came here on her own,
bury the hatchet,

09:53.694 --> 09:55.195
and do the security herself.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.698
- Wait, she came here tonight,
after her shift?

09:57.731 --> 10:01.034
- That's what I'm telling you.
Is there a problem?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.136
- She seem out of sorts at all?
Upset?

10:03.170 --> 10:06.206
- She always upset.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.675
Look, tonight's
big complaint was,

10:07.708 --> 10:10.143
she had to go see
her old man.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.780
Guess he's some type
of hard-ass too.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.315
*

10:15.348 --> 10:17.651
- Thank you.
- All right.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.753
*

10:19.787 --> 10:22.189
- Huh.
Someone's watching.

10:22.222 --> 10:29.262

10:33.033 --> 10:36.069
[cell phone rings]

10:38.138 --> 10:40.107
- What is it, Ruzek?

10:40.140 --> 10:47.180
*

10:54.421 --> 10:56.356
- Chicago Police!

10:56.389 --> 10:58.358

10:58.391 --> 11:01.729
[door creaks]
- Oh, okay.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.163
- It's open.

11:03.196 --> 11:10.003
*

11:10.037 --> 11:11.238
- Hey.

11:27.788 --> 11:34.795

11:36.296 --> 11:39.266
- 5021, we got a man down
with multiple gunshot wounds.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.433
Roll the crime lab

11:40.467 --> 11:42.435
and make the proper
notifications.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.772
- Copy that, 5021.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.040
- No need for an ambulance.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.209

[dark music]

11:56.784 --> 12:01.254
*

12:01.288 --> 12:02.890
- There's no sign
of forced entry,

12:02.923 --> 12:04.825
except for us coming
through the front door.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.760
Could be
he knew the guy or guys.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.161
Could be
they had a nice dinner,

12:08.195 --> 12:09.963
and somebody said
something wrong thing.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.264
- He was tortured
for information.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.866
- I know you're working fast,

12:12.900 --> 12:15.268
but all I said
was extensive contusions.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.171
- He was tortured, and Platt
was hit three blocks from here.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.173
- They came here looking
for Platt's whereabouts.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.776
That's what you're thinking?
- Yeah.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.978
- So, Trudy has dinner,
she left,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.113
guy or guys enter,

12:26.146 --> 12:29.817
they rough up Mr. Platt
till they get Trudy's location,

12:29.850 --> 12:31.018
but they waste him anyway?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.286
- But why were they after Platt?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.988
- That's what we're trying
to determine.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.057
- Come here a second.
I wanna tell you something.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.291
- Okay, what?

12:38.325 --> 12:41.161
- You know Platt's dad
was into some shady deals.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.830
Now, if she wound up
in the middle of something,

12:42.863 --> 12:44.064
this might get worse for her.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.166
- Well,
we can't think about that.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.901
- All right, regardless,

12:47.935 --> 12:49.002
it's also possible that

12:49.036 --> 12:51.004
she wasn't even the target;
he was.

12:51.038 --> 12:55.008
You know, they roughed her up
to get his location.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.844
- Look, we got to
make the connection.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.012
Someone wanted them
both to suffer.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.949
We find out why,
then we'll know who.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.183
- How's she doing?

13:03.216 --> 13:06.186
- She's in surgery.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.188
It looks bad.

13:08.221 --> 13:14.161
*

13:14.194 --> 13:17.831
Robert Platt, age 72.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.967
Well, this is no longer
an isolated attack

13:20.000 --> 13:21.969
against a sergeant
in our district.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.971
Mr. Platt was found
in his apartment.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.572
He'd been beaten,
shot several times

13:25.605 --> 13:27.540
with a .357 caliber.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.675
- He's got no priors,

13:28.708 --> 13:31.845
but he was investigated
by Financial Crimes and the IRS.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.847
Three buildings,
his development company put up,

13:33.881 --> 13:34.747
they went bankrupt.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.516
- He made a lot of people rich
in the '80s

13:36.549 --> 13:38.185
and lost money for them
ever since.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.988
- Neighbor called in shots fired
at 10:04 p.m.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.023
Patrol responded
by throwing the zone operator

13:43.056 --> 13:44.157
a code 19-Paul.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.093
- And nobody else called
in the shots?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.961
- No, so patrol
didn't knock,

13:47.995 --> 13:49.096
but that gives us
a timeline.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.265
Platt leaves her house,
offender enters, shoots Robert.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.167
Platt buys
a water bottle at CVS.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.003
15 minutes later,
she's attacked.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.070
- And he wasn't robbed.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.338
- Nothing appeared
to be disturbed,

13:58.371 --> 14:00.974
except for the living room where
there was an apparent struggle.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.175
- All right, listen.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.111
I liked Robert,

14:04.144 --> 14:06.579
but I think we're looking
at the wrong Platt.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.282
I want you to cross-reference
everybody he did business with

14:09.316 --> 14:12.652
against anybody Trudy
arrested, beefed with, anything.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.955
She's counting on us
to get this right,

14:14.988 --> 14:17.257
so is her husband.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.892
So am I.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.966
- So?

14:25.999 --> 14:27.667
- So Platt came in
with what looked like

14:27.700 --> 14:29.903
an orbital blowout fracture.

14:29.937 --> 14:30.904
CT came back clear.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.940
- What does that mean?
Is she gonna be okay?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.674
- She is.
- He's being modest.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.676
Um, Platt had a bad bleed
in her eye socket.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.046
Thanks to Dr. Rhodes,
no permanent damage.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.680
- She's up, she's alert,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.182
she's kind of rude.
- [scoffs]

14:42.215 --> 14:43.316
- All cylinders firing.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.185
- Thank you.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.322
- What's wrong?
You okay?

14:49.356 --> 14:52.059
- Um, her dad...

14:58.465 --> 15:00.300
- [sighs]

15:00.333 --> 15:01.334
- Hey, Sarge.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.436
- [sighs]
I didn't see him.

15:03.470 --> 15:07.107
I heard footsteps,
and then I got conked.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.609
- Trudy, we went
back through your night,

15:09.642 --> 15:11.078
so we know that
you had dinner

15:11.111 --> 15:13.680
with your father
before you were attacked.

15:13.713 --> 15:17.184
We rolled the unit to his house.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.686
Uh, to...

15:19.719 --> 15:22.155
- This is, uh, really hard.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.423
Uh, I'm just gonna
say it, Sarge.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.626
They found
your father unresponsive.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.061
Olinsky was in first.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.696
There were signs
of a struggle.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.299
He had multiple
gunshot wounds.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.733
- What are you saying?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.036
- I'm--I'm...

15:36.069 --> 15:38.038
- I'm sorry.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.673
There was nothing
we could do.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.009
- Nothing that we could do?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.443
Don't--don't--
don't talk to me

15:43.476 --> 15:46.113
like I'm some victim.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.448
- Trudy, tonight you are.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.251
I'm so sorry,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.286
but he's gone.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.256
[solemn music]

15:56.289 --> 15:58.325
*

15:58.358 --> 16:02.262
- [exhales]
Do you have witnesses?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.764
Do you have anything?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.067
- No, they just found him.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.437
Did you get a look at the guy?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.139
- No.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.408
I saw gloves,

16:15.442 --> 16:17.410
and he had my gun.

16:17.444 --> 16:21.014
*

16:21.048 --> 16:23.016
That's all I remember.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.053
My dad's house,
did it look like a robbery?

16:26.086 --> 16:28.255
- No.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.057
And we're going through
all your files,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.724
but we're missing something.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.759
Do you have any idea

16:32.792 --> 16:36.329
who would want to
hurt your family like this?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.431
- My family?
No.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.432
Uh, mm,

16:39.466 --> 16:42.769
mmm, hmm, nope.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.771
I can't even think straight.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.174
*

16:47.207 --> 16:50.177
- Okay.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.145
Rest up.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.748
I'm so sorry.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.050
Commander.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.486
*

16:59.519 --> 17:01.288
- I'm sorry, Sarge.

17:01.321 --> 17:05.425
*

17:05.458 --> 17:06.759
- [sighs]

17:06.792 --> 17:08.428
Trudy,

17:08.461 --> 17:10.329
I'm so sorry.

17:10.363 --> 17:17.369
*

17:20.607 --> 17:22.842
- Wait.
What are you trying to say?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.211
- Platt did something.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.744
There's something
going on here.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.315
- When?
- At the hospital, she...

17:29.616 --> 17:31.751
I think that she's got
an offender in mind,

17:31.784 --> 17:34.087
but nobody popped
in her files.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.589
- If she's thinking of somebody,
but they aren't in her files...

17:36.623 --> 17:39.126
- We got to go see Virginia
in the Records Department.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.227
- Yeah.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.294
- Can't do it.

17:41.328 --> 17:44.364
- Virginia, she's your friend,
and she was attacked.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.599
- And I won't incriminate myself
or my friend.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.502
- We know that you did a Records
Administration search for Platt.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.471
Just give us a name.
Who'd she look into?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.473
- I know that looking up
a civilian without

17:53.506 --> 17:54.607
a case assigned is illegal.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.109
I don't care.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.111
Okay, we don't care.
This is moving fast.

17:58.145 --> 18:01.114
Please, don't stand
in our way on this.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.815
- [sighs]
- It's Trudy.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.484
- Okay, I looked into a girl.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.119
She was dating Trudy's father.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.388
- Okay.
- Natalie Kern.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.556
But it's not her you want.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.125
It's her ex-boyfriend,
repeat offender.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.294
Him, Leonard Milwood.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.263
There's a record
if I print this.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.598
- I'm gonna delete this
as soon the second we get him.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.633
- Racketeering,
aggravated assault,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.502
strong-arm robbery,
attempted bribery.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.836
He's ambitious.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.538
- Trudy thought they were
working an angle.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.275
They wanted money,
and her father

18:28.308 --> 18:30.277
liked to represent
like he had it.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.879
And now look.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.447
- Thank you.

18:37.884 --> 18:38.918
- Sarge, we think Platt

18:38.951 --> 18:41.354
got a bad vibe off the girl
her dad was dating,

18:41.388 --> 18:42.922
so she did a records search.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.392
That's Natalie Kern.
She's got an ex-boyfriend.

18:45.425 --> 18:49.496
His name's Leonard Milwood,
career stickup guy.

18:49.529 --> 18:53.333
- So, Trudy thinks these two
are gonna rip off her old man,

18:53.366 --> 18:55.302
but they find out
she's looking into them?

18:55.335 --> 18:58.171
- And then she becomes
collateral damage.

- All right, well,
get two covert cars

18:59.872 --> 19:00.940

- Already did.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.843
The uniforms haven't seen
either one of them yet.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.312
- Hey.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.414
So I flagged all of
Robert Platt's credit cards.

One of them just swiped at
a business over on Roosevelt,

30s, good-looking.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.222
This is two minutes ago.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.389

Natalie Kern,
you are under arrest.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.948
- Get off me!
I didn't do anything.

- Yeah?
Then why did you run?

Stay down!

20:21.053 --> 20:24.424

Who'd you text?

20:24.457 --> 20:26.359
Huh?
- [grunting]

20:26.393 --> 20:28.728
- "Police."
Is Leonard Milwood here?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.330
- He's talking to you.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.564
- I don't have to talk to you.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.334
- Yeah, you sure do.
Is he here?

20:34.367 --> 20:36.436
- Oh, my God, my car!
Oh, my God, please.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.437
Help me, please, somebody.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.671
Somebody, please help.
- Kev.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.473
- He took my car!
He took my car!

20:40.507 --> 20:43.410
He took my car--this way!
He's right outside!

20:43.443 --> 20:45.044
He's over there!
Over here!

20:45.077 --> 20:47.013
He's coming around the back!
Please!

20:47.046 --> 20:49.682
He stole my car!

- We executed a search warrant

21:20.813 --> 21:23.683
at your apartment, Natalie.

You have quite the collection
of gold watches.

Most of them have
Robert Platt's initials on them.

How do you pronounce it?

or something?

Audemars Piguet.

21:37.930 --> 21:38.998
- Oh.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.033
- They were all gifts
for my birthday last month.

That's a nice gift.

that line again,

21:47.874 --> 21:50.710
but this time
with some feeling, babe?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.412
All right, I'm gonna fill
in the blanks.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.080
You're a con artist,
so is your boyfriend.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.016
Only he has a habit
of getting caught.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.685
And you targeted
Robert Platt,

21:58.718 --> 22:01.053
a rich, older man,
and you killed him.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.623
You tried to kill his daughter,
a Chicago police officer,

22:03.656 --> 22:04.957
'cause she didn't trust you.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.126
Only you sent
your boyfriend do it,

22:07.159 --> 22:08.395
and he's so stupid,

22:08.428 --> 22:11.431
he botched the job
and she lived.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.932
- No?

You represented
that you were single.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.101
You're still with Leonard?

22:15.134 --> 22:16.135
- Yeah, but that's
not a crime.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.937
- It's motive for murder.

22:17.970 --> 22:18.971
- And you ran.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.039
Why'd you run, Natalie?

22:20.072 --> 22:22.742
- You know, you guys all ask
the same questions.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.910

22:23.943 --> 22:25.445
have them processed
for the homicide

22:25.478 --> 22:26.779
and attempted murder
of a police officer.

22:26.813 --> 22:30.450
- No, wait,
we didn't kill anyone.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.051
- Oh, this is where
she gives you up, Leonard.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.153
I'm telling you,
I've seen this movie before.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.623
- That's what, three times
you're a loser?

22:36.656 --> 22:37.857
Do you really want to go back
in front of a judge

22:37.890 --> 22:39.125
without telling
your side of this?

22:39.158 --> 22:41.894

We can take him for a ride."

All her.

of his stuff in storage.

anybody in my life.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.053
Natalie either.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.120
- And last night,

23:08.154 --> 23:09.388
I was at a club near the house.

23:09.422 --> 23:12.925
He was in a casino in Indiana.
He didn't get home till late.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.694
Look, Robert is a nice man.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.928
I think he knew
I was stealing from him,

23:15.962 --> 23:17.196
and I don't think he cared.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.799
He just--he--
he just liked me.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.868
- Well, a lot of guys
make that mistake, right?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.736
- So--why would I
want to kill him?

23:23.770 --> 23:25.071
He transferred
everything he had,

23:25.104 --> 23:26.806

six months ago.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.817
- All right.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.753
and everything you stole
off Robert Platt

23:52.565 --> 23:54.133
- Antonio.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.869
From the Asset Forfeiture Unit.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.871
Robert Platt really was
transferring ownership

23:58.905 --> 24:00.907
in all those LLCs
to Trudy Platt's name.

a pretty good job too.

24:04.811 --> 24:05.912
Can't find his name anywhere.

- Even so, Platt's rich,

24:08.915 --> 24:11.083
like, officially.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.118
- So at this time,

24:12.151 --> 24:14.253
we can't find a financial motive
for these attacks.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.988
So what, it's personal?

24:16.022 --> 24:18.124
It's revenge?

scare some guys?

You have a hidden camera

you recorded last night

between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m.?

26:06.966 --> 26:09.669

she was a friend of mine,

26:12.705 --> 26:14.240

26:14.273 --> 26:17.877

like private clubs.

So...let's get the tape,

was looking for someone.

No, nothing.

in Platt's dad's files.

a construction company

28:51.230 --> 28:52.431

for Platt's dad,

He's fresh out Stateville
for an eight-year bump.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.277

with Sergeant Platt?

Narcotics pinched him.

at some point.

Platt knows
how to cover her tracks.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.290

make a connection.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.487
you didn't want
to talk on the phone?

29:48.520 --> 29:50.189

from a sergeant

29:51.357 --> 29:53.459

29:53.492 --> 29:56.462
- You didn't have enough
for a warrant?

29:56.495 --> 29:58.430
- Without Platt's
Jane Doe tip,

29:58.464 --> 30:02.434
we never would've gotten paper
to get in that house.
