WEBVTT

00:04.600 --> 00:05.601
Charlie Bradbury.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.603
Charlie.

00:07.680 --> 00:08.602
What's up, bitches?

00:08.680 --> 00:10.045
How does
a high-school dropout

00:10.080 --> 00:11.286
become
one of the brightest minds

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
of Roman Inc.?

00:12.400 --> 00:13.765
Historically,
I've had this problem with...

00:13.840 --> 00:14.921
with authority.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.286
Is there such thing
as a monster magnet?

00:16.360 --> 00:17.600
When did you become
such an expert?

00:17.680 --> 00:18.806
After you guys left,

00:18.880 --> 00:20.086
I dug into all things monstrous.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.246
I'm a wee bit obsessive.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.884
If "a wee bit" means completely.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.490
There is a big difference

00:24.560 --> 00:27.040
between reading about hunting
and actually hunting.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.808
I'm... I'm more hunter
in training.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.450
Totally not worth killing.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.965
You know,
you really should come back

00:35.040 --> 00:36.371
and dig through our archives.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.011
You are definitely
a Woman of Letters.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.286
I like the sound of that.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.011
It is the safest
place on Earth.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.004
Warded against
any evil ever created.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.481
It is the supernatural
mother lode.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.528
If knowledge is power,

00:50.600 --> 00:53.729
then this is the most powerful
place on Earth.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.371
Sammy, I think
we found the Bat Cave.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.164
Protocols complete.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.440
James Haggerty.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.885
Peter Jenkins.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.409
Did we do everything right?

01:58.480 --> 02:00.721
Shouldn't...

02:05.560 --> 02:08.370
It took three years
to build this dump?

02:08.479 --> 02:10.050
Dump?

02:10.240 --> 02:13.847
Dump?

02:13.880 --> 02:15.166
Are you kidding?

02:16.400 --> 02:17.640
Do you realize where we are?

02:17.720 --> 02:21.566
This... This dump is the last
true beacon of light in...

02:21.600 --> 02:23.443
In a world gone
topsy-turvy.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.727
This dump is the epicenter of...

02:25.800 --> 02:29.521
Of the ultimate chess match
between Good and Evil.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.888
What a dump.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.286
You know,
when I got this assignment,

02:41.360 --> 02:42.282
I thought there'd be...

02:42.360 --> 02:43.361
I don't know.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.401
Excitement?

02:44.480 --> 02:45.686
Adventure?

02:45.760 --> 02:48.206
There's nothing worse
than adventure, my boy.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.730
Trust me.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.810
Extension 765.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.803
Yes.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.880
No.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.161
That's not the password.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.481
There's protocol here,
young lady.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.610
We'll be waiting.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.327
We have a guest.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.890
Damn hunter.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.769
Frank's kid.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.080
Really?

03:18.120 --> 03:20.122
Wow.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.804
What he did for her, that...

03:21.880 --> 03:23.086
That was really something.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.885
It was something all right.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.404
Holy buckets.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.811
It's really you.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.081
That's right, rookie,
it's really me.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.121
Dorothy.

03:43.280 --> 03:46.124
Now which one of you geniuses

03:46.160 --> 03:48.640
is gonna help me
kill the Wicked Witch?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.650
Hello, Moose.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.009
You want more Demon names?

04:18.920 --> 04:20.490
I want a room with a view.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.529
We can discuss this.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.570
I'd settle
for stretching my legs.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.725
Bollocks.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.044
Hey.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.451
How'd it go with Kevin?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.648
Well, that little nerd is

04:50.720 --> 04:52.961
in a lovely warded motel room
in Branson.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.724
He's got about 48 hours
of pay-per-porn

04:54.800 --> 04:57.326
and Kenny Rogers ahead of him.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.322
How's he feeling?

04:58.400 --> 05:00.880
Well, he stared
at the Angel Tablet

05:00.960 --> 05:04.487
and repeated the word 'falafel'
for the entire ride.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.442
Kid's cracked.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.000
I'm hoping this break will, uh,
clear his head.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.690
You know, after
everything that happened,

05:09.720 --> 05:11.131
I figured we could use
a little break ourselves,

05:11.200 --> 05:13.851
so I, uh, picked you up

05:13.880 --> 05:16.121
Season one, Game of Thrones,

05:16.200 --> 05:18.680
figured we'd get
a little takeout.

05:18.720 --> 05:19.926
All right, well, first,

05:19.960 --> 05:22.247
I think I might have found
a way to help Cass.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.281
What, did you talk to him?

05:25.360 --> 05:27.203
No.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.207
And by the way,

05:28.240 --> 05:30.208
I still don't understand
why he left in the first place.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.368
I mean, the bunker
is the safest place for him.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.367
Bartholomew and

05:33.400 --> 05:34.765
who knows how many other Angels

05:34.840 --> 05:36.410
are out there gunning for him.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.447
Hey.
Look.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.482
Nobody wants him here
more than I do, okay?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.562
But, uh,

05:41.600 --> 05:43.204
he felt like he'd bring trouble
down on us,

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
so he had to split.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.408
But if you got a way
to help him,

05:46.440 --> 05:47.930
I'm all ears.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.241
All right.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.851
So Kevin said the table lit up
like a Christmas Tree

05:52.920 --> 05:54.040
when the Angels fell, right?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.650
So?

05:55.720 --> 05:57.563
So it turns out each light

05:57.600 --> 05:59.284
was where
a cluster of Angels fell.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.282
So I'm thinking,

06:00.360 --> 06:01.964
Maybe there's some way
to hotwire this.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.604
Make it track Angels.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.768
That way we could help
Cass steer clear of danger.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.451
This was your idea?

06:10.640 --> 06:13.120
Do you see anybody else in here?

06:15.600 --> 06:16.522
So how would it work?

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
No idea.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.688
See, at first I thought
the table was the computer,

06:19.760 --> 06:20.760
but it's not.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.722
It turns out
it's just part of it.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.961
But I did find these cables
underneath it

06:23.000 --> 06:25.162
and I followed them.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.242
You're never gonna believe
what I found.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.645
Voila.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.365
- This is a computer?
- Yeah.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.444
Uh, it was, in 1951
when it was installed.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.562
Now here's the crazy thing.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.681
It's not plugged into anything.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.886
I mean, I have no idea

06:55.960 --> 06:57.689
what's making this thing work.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.887
It's warm here.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.281
Got it.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.882
- Huh.
- Well, that looks simple.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.486
Does it come
with a manual?

07:30.520 --> 07:31.851
Got nothing in the archives.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.405
And I obviously
couldn't find anything

07:33.480 --> 07:34.402
like it online.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.891
Not to mention, I'm pretty sure

07:35.960 --> 07:37.803
that the Men of Letters
doesn't exactly have

07:37.880 --> 07:40.042
IT support anymore, either.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.323
I think I know somebody
who can help us.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
Come on.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.686
So, what do you have to say
for yourself?

08:14.760 --> 08:15.727
Nothing.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.444
I cut out her tongue.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.841
I've bound her,
but it won't last.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.891
Wait, you captured her?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.081
All by yourself?

08:25.160 --> 08:26.082
Yes.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.650
Despite all my lady parts,

08:27.720 --> 08:29.210
I managed to capture
the Wicked Witch.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.288
Well, your father
would be very proud.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.321
I mean, did you know that he...

08:32.400 --> 08:33.890
Wasted my time with his words

08:33.919 --> 08:35.445
and I'd appreciate it
if you didn't do the same.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.442
Now.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.886
I have tried cutting off
her head, burning her,

08:38.919 --> 08:40.570
dousing her with holy water.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.760
All she did was laugh.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.722
Nothing I know of can kill her.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.286
So I'm here as a last resort.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.924
I was hoping you stiffs
have a way to kill someone

08:47.960 --> 08:48.961
from Oz.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.240
Well, of course we do.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.725
I... We... We have to.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.405
Uh, this place is
the last true beacon of light.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.407
All right.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.920
Just open your damn books,
already.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.450
All right, Jenkins.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.363
Let's go to work.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.809
Look who it is.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.360
Hey!

09:14.280 --> 09:15.805
Thanks for coming.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.691
Not a problem.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.762
Especially since I got fired
last week.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.609
Hey, what?
What happened?

09:22.640 --> 09:24.449
Turns out the company
I worked for

09:24.480 --> 09:26.005
was outsourcing to child labor.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.442
So, took a big Wikileak
all over that.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.005
And yeah.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.247
It's cool, though.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.209
It's given me more time
to focus on my hobbies.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.283
Like LARPing,

09:38.320 --> 09:39.765
macrame,

09:39.840 --> 09:41.285
and hunting.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.049
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.441
It was just a couple
little cases.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.522
I took down
a teenaged vampire and a ghost.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.046
Which sounds like a YA novel

09:50.120 --> 09:51.042
if you say it out loud.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.120
Charlie.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.127
How'd it go?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.208
It was...

09:56.520 --> 09:57.885
It was intense,

09:57.920 --> 09:59.285
but I kind of wish...

10:00.320 --> 10:03.563
...hunting was more magical.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.846
You know?

10:09.160 --> 10:10.286
Never mind.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.728
So where's this Commodore 64
of yours?

10:13.840 --> 10:16.969
Sweet Ada Lovelace.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.010
This thing belongs in a museum.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.963
I mean,
it's got encryption software,

10:22.040 --> 10:24.042
it seems to be powered
by something magical.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.360
Skip to the end.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.084
It's kind of an alarm system.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.241
Global badness?

10:28.320 --> 10:29.320
It freaks.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.840
This computer
is what locked this place down.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.247
Can we use it to track Angels?

10:36.720 --> 10:37.881
All right,

10:39.200 --> 10:40.690
let me see what I can do.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.442
All right, it took some doing,
but now,

11:12.520 --> 11:13.885
we can download.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.082
This beast has
all the Men of Letters' files.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.605
Time for a little drag and drop.

11:17.920 --> 11:18.648
Wow.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.721
Well, that's a start.

11:19.760 --> 11:20.727
Thank you.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.922
Um, that's...
That's great.

11:24.760 --> 11:25.807
So you've been hunting.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.765
Alone.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.840
I know.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.008
Not a good idea according
to the Supernatural books.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.244
You really can't delete those
from the internet?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.611
Not even I could do that.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.011
I mean, come on.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.650
Where do you even find them?

11:41.760 --> 11:45.128
A top secret place
I call Amazon.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.047
And someone uploaded
all the unpublished works.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.645
I thought
it was fan-fie at first,

11:50.720 --> 11:52.131
but it was clearly
Edlund's work.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.161
Who uploaded it?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.162
I don't know.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.403
Their screen name was
BeckyWinchester176.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.289
- Ring a bell?
- None.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.321
Uh, nobody's...

12:00.360 --> 12:01.441
No, there are no bells.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.369
Uh, no.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.886
Uh, these files are encrypted,

12:05.960 --> 12:07.849
this is gonna take a while.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.967
So.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Takeout?

12:10.080 --> 12:11.605
Sleepover?
Braid each others' hair?

12:11.640 --> 12:13.404
I've got an idea.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.490
Wow, that Jeffrey's a dick.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.000
Oh, you have no idea.
Wait until he...

12:24.080 --> 12:25.047
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.485
Spoilers.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.686
I haven't read
all the books yet.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.250
You're gonna read the books?

12:29.320 --> 12:32.164
Yes, Dean, I like to read books.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.481
You know,
the ones without pictures?

12:35.600 --> 12:36.408
Man.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.006
This bed is about
as comfortable as a brick.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.161
Any plans on moving in
anytime soon?

12:43.240 --> 12:44.651
I am moved in.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.806
This is just my style.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.810
Yeah, this is his, uh, style.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.047
Well, I'm sorry
I haven't hung up the, uh,

12:51.120 --> 12:52.485
"Hang in there, Kitty" poster
yet, Dean.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.806
Feel free to redecorate.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.205
So, what,
our home's not good enough

12:55.240 --> 12:56.446
for the "Hang in there,
Kitty" poster?

12:56.520 --> 12:58.807
This isn't our home,
this is where we work.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.370
What's the difference?

13:01.880 --> 13:04.565
Okay.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.728
All right,

13:06.800 --> 13:09.246
well, I'm gonna go get us
some more beers.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.606
How about that?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.361
So, Charlie,

13:16.440 --> 13:18.841
what was all that about
how hunting isn't magical?

13:21.160 --> 13:22.605
Saving people.
Hunting things.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.681
The family business?

13:23.720 --> 13:24.721
I am down.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.964
But I was raised
on Tolkein, man.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.486
I mean, where is all this?

13:31.560 --> 13:32.925
Where are my White Walkers,

13:33.040 --> 13:36.362
and my volcano and magic ring
to throw in the damn thing?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.562
Where...

13:38.600 --> 13:39.761
Where's my quest?

13:39.880 --> 13:40.767
Magic?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.405
Quests?

13:42.440 --> 13:45.683
Suck.
Trust me.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.250
They're all...

13:47.320 --> 13:49.561
Dead ends.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.250
Nothing but dead ends.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.203
There's got to be
some way to kill this thing.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.081
Jenkins, don't!

14:02.280 --> 14:04.089
Something here belongs to me.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.491
Take me to it.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.971
What the hell
is it talking about?

14:07.040 --> 14:07.962
I have no idea.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.725
Do you have a lab?

14:10.760 --> 14:12.808
Second floor.
Room 28.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.484
Wait!

14:19.600 --> 14:22.285
Jenkins.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.964
I know you're in there.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.445
Jenkins is gone.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.001
Jenkins.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.720
Jenkins.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.002
You...
You were right.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.885
There's nothing worse
than adventure.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.690
Dorothy!

15:03.800 --> 15:04.961
Dorothy!

15:09.920 --> 15:12.002
Download should be done by now.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.371
What the hell?

15:19.280 --> 15:21.521
Sam, give me a hand.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.451
Holy crap.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.251
The first case investigated
in this bunker involved Dorothy.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.726
She and the Witch
came into this room

16:20.760 --> 16:22.649
and they never came out.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.484
This will never stop
blowing my mind.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.722
Okay, pace yourself, Toto.

16:27.000 --> 16:27.887
Oz is real.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.046
It's part of the fairy world.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.161
We have to find her.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.562
No we need to talk before
anyone does anything, okay?

16:33.640 --> 16:34.880
Dorothy?

16:34.920 --> 16:36.410
Talk.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.767
Oh, typical Men of Letters.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.484
Standing around
having a nice little chat,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.250
with your noses
buried in your books

16:42.280 --> 16:44.044
while your little secretary
takes notes.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.047
We're Hunters.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.286
And who are you
calling a secretary?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.721
You're not a secretary?

16:48.760 --> 16:50.125
You're a Woman of Letters?

16:51.200 --> 16:53.441
How long have I been out?

16:53.520 --> 16:55.363
That's why we need to talk.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.363
Look, you've been gone
for over 75 years.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.091
Now according to our files,
you came here

17:00.120 --> 17:03.169
to kill the Wicked Witch
and then disappeared.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.445
What happened?

17:04.520 --> 17:07.922
We couldn't find a way
to kill her.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.166
So I did the only thing
that I could.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.122
It's you and me forever, bitch.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.846
A binding spell
that came at a price.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.729
Her soul with mine.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.165
So you've been frozen
with the Witch

17:44.200 --> 17:45.929
for all this time?

17:46.000 --> 17:46.967
Yes.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.764
Look.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.007
The Witch cannot be killed.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.043
If I'm awake, then so is she.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.090
Hello, lovely.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.843
Sorry.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.326
This litter box is warded
against everything.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.691
Even Wicked Witches.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.001
Big fan.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.845
Love your work.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.082
What's the matter, darling?

18:24.160 --> 18:25.764
Cowardly Lion got your tongue?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.769
Right, enough chit-chat.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.490
You must be here for a reason.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.484
Write it down so Daddy can help.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.325
Wait, if she's here,
why didn't she kill you?

18:44.360 --> 18:45.600
She can't.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.251
You're protected, by the Witch
of the North's kiss.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.321
It's from the books.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.566
Oh, forget the books.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.562
They're not important.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.688
I'm protected, you aren't.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.324
Now the Witch came here
looking for something.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.164
I have no idea what it is,
but we have to find her,

18:57.200 --> 18:58.531
before she finds it.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.766
All right, all right.
Charlie, dig into the files.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.569
See if you can find anything
that puts a dent in a Witch.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.160
Sam and I will
have a look-see, come on.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.244
- I'm helping.
- Yeah, I don't doubt it.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.441
But for right now,
why don't you rest up

19:07.520 --> 19:09.120
and help the smartest person
in the room.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.441
So.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.921
- Big fan.
- Hm.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.922
Ozma of Oz...

19:25.000 --> 19:26.843
ls a total ass.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.244
You were much nicer
in the books.

19:31.280 --> 19:35.205
Those books are the ravings
of a sad old man, my father.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.480
Wait.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.961
Your dad was L. Frank Baum?
The writer?

19:39.040 --> 19:41.361
A Man of Letters.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.602
Another glorified Librarian,
you ask me.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.047
Hey, these guys
may have been sexist,

19:46.120 --> 19:48.327
but like all Librarians,
they were wicked smart too.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.323
The dude who was here
when you came in?

19:50.400 --> 19:51.686
Haggerty?

19:51.760 --> 19:53.125
He kept your case file open.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.884
Worked it every day
until he retired.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.849
Obviously, he never found you,

19:56.920 --> 19:58.843
but, if you took
five seconds to read,

19:58.920 --> 20:01.127
he did find a way
to fight the Wicked Witch.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.848
Do you remember the poppy fields
in the first book?

20:04.920 --> 20:07.321
That's not actually
how it happened.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.481
It was much bloodier.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.568
Stop ruining my childhood.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.760
Do you remember the poppies?

20:12.520 --> 20:13.601
Good.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.801
Haggerty made a deal
with a Fairy

20:14.840 --> 20:16.604
and got some poppy extract.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.926
I'm gonna get some bullets
from the gun range

20:17.960 --> 20:20.167
and make us some poppy bullets.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.602
So are you coming or what?

20:43.320 --> 20:44.606
Well.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.728
If it isn't Scarecrow
and the Tin-Man.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.281
Your new house guest,

20:49.320 --> 20:51.322
so misunderstood.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.610
Neither of you saw Wicked?

20:54.680 --> 20:55.681
What did she say to you?

20:55.720 --> 20:59.042
Something along the lines of...

21:01.840 --> 21:04.411
All right, I'm gonna get
some holy oil and a lighter,

21:04.480 --> 21:05.402
dickbag.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.847
I know what she's looking for.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.763
What does she want?

21:09.840 --> 21:11.842
I'd be happy to tell you.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.691
As soon as
I get to stretch my legs.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.761
Oh...

21:45.400 --> 21:48.051
All right.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.491
What does the Witch want?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.210
Give me a mo'.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.730
Still need to air myself out.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.243
I think you're aired out enough.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.766
Rude.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.611
"Key."

22:05.680 --> 22:06.761
What key?

22:06.840 --> 22:09.047
Haven't the foggiest.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.970
Had to send her off
on a merry chase

22:12.040 --> 22:14.088
before she could melt me.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.925
Told her you boys
kept the keys in the kitchen.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.960
You do have a kitchen
in this craphole, don't you?

22:30.360 --> 22:31.282
Damn it.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.930
I just cleaned in here.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.490
Really?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.483
Looks like we got a witch here.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.282
Sorry.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.566
We raided your gun range.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.285
Made us some poppy bullets.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.282
They won't kill the Witch,

22:46.360 --> 22:47.964
but they will stun the crap
out of her.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.691
That's my girl.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.807
There was only enough
for four bullets,

22:52.840 --> 22:54.842
SO...

22:54.920 --> 22:56.081
make each shot count.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.246
Now we just have to find her

22:58.280 --> 23:00.248
before she finds whatever
the hell she's looking for.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.566
She's looking for a key.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.449
Well, how do you know?

23:03.480 --> 23:06.370
Little birdie told us.

23:06.440 --> 23:07.487
Ring any bells, Dorothy?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.648
Unfortunately.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.801
It's the Key to Oz.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.485
There are magical ways into Oz.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.285
Tornado, eye of a hurricane,
whirlpool.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.209
But this key will turn any
locked door

23:18.280 --> 23:19.361
into a portal to Oz.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.488
Insert the Key,
twist, and presto,

23:21.520 --> 23:22.567
you're in Oz.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.165
Well, how did the Men of Letters
get the key?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.645
I have no idea,

23:25.720 --> 23:27.722
but if she finds it,
she'll go back

23:27.840 --> 23:29.080
and finish what she started.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.049
She'll destroy
all that's good in Oz.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.168
She's got armies of Witches,

23:33.240 --> 23:34.571
flying monkeys.

23:34.680 --> 23:35.841
Many will die.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.888
What's this key look like?

23:43.960 --> 23:46.361
I've seen that key.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.051
I found it
when I was doing inventory.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.485
Where is it now?

23:53.520 --> 23:54.567
My room.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.846
We got to get to that key.
All right.

23:55.880 --> 23:56.881
Charlie, and I will
go look in my room.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.883
Why don't you guys
buy us some time.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.486
Charlie,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.128
the safest place
in this joint is the dungeon.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.567
You have a dungeon
in this place?

24:09.640 --> 24:10.641
Of course you do.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.330
So maybe you should...

24:12.360 --> 24:13.964
I am not hiding.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.485
Especially in a dungeon.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.487
Wicked Witch?

24:16.520 --> 24:18.363
A key?
A quest?

24:18.440 --> 24:20.807
Let's do this.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.882
Char... Charlie?

24:28.680 --> 24:32.127
I can't believe
I've lived here for 75 years.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.005
How long have you called
this place home?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.610
My brother calls it home.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.409
Me, I, uh...

24:38.480 --> 24:40.289
I haven't that much
luck with homes.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.646
Me neither.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.041
Overrated, you ask me.

24:44.080 --> 24:48.085
Yellow bricks or not,
give me the open road any day.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.565
Sam!

24:56.960 --> 24:59.042
She can get anywhere from there.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.084
Split up, cover more ground.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.800
You keep your porn meticulously
organized, but not...

25:07.880 --> 25:10.247
Don't judge me.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.081
Ah!

25:30.040 --> 25:31.565
Yahtzee.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.289
Dean!

25:40.920 --> 25:42.001
No!

25:57.280 --> 25:58.486
Charlie?

26:01.800 --> 26:03.609
Charlie?

26:06.120 --> 26:08.646
Charlie!

26:19.880 --> 26:23.123
Charlie.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.887
Charlie.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.724
No!

26:29.080 --> 26:29.729
Dean?

26:29.800 --> 26:31.006
Zeke!

26:33.120 --> 26:34.610
You have to help her.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.481
She's gone.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.646
No, you can bring her back,

26:42.680 --> 26:43.647
like you did with Cass.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.647
I cannot keep doing that.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.647
Why the hell not?

26:45.680 --> 26:47.648
I am barely
back to half strength, Dean.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.650
Every time I use my power,
it weakens me.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.523
Which means I will have
to stay in your brother

26:52.600 --> 26:54.682
longer than you want.

26:54.720 --> 26:55.881
Longer than we both want.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.488
The Witch running around
your bunker is very powerful.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.366
I can help with the Witch
or save your friend.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.930
Save her.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.048
As you wish.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.966
Merry Christmas!

27:33.040 --> 27:33.962
Charlie?

27:34.040 --> 27:34.962
Hi.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.326
Yeah, I know you.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.804
I told you to stay
in the Dungeon.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.450
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.726
Dean?

27:44.760 --> 27:45.727
Sammy?

27:45.760 --> 27:48.604
What the hell just happened?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.011
The Witch...

27:50.080 --> 27:51.286
The Witch was about to
put a whammy on me.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.409
And, uh,
Charlie jumped in front.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.283
She got zapped.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.926
Then the Witch
got the drop on you.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.570
Then why aren't we dead?

28:00.600 --> 28:02.489
That's a good question.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.561
'ZZZ

28:03.600 --> 28:05.728
I clipped her with a...
With a poppy bullet,

28:05.760 --> 28:07.888
but she got the Key.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.922
I think she's gone.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.445
No.
She's wounded.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.720
We should still have some time,

28:13.760 --> 28:15.171
she could still be
in the air vents.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.366
No.
She's right.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.566
We have to...
We...

28:17.600 --> 28:18.647
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.166
Just go.
We'll catch up.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.651
My... My gun's over there.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.768
There's one bullet in it.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.962
Can we be best friends now?

28:41.760 --> 28:43.967
Who's Zeke?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.490
What?

28:45.560 --> 28:47.642
When I came into your room,

28:48.800 --> 28:49.801
before I got zapped,

28:49.840 --> 28:51.285
I thought you said
the name Zeke.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.130
- Who's that?
- Um...

28:55.800 --> 28:58.201
I think you're still
a little punchy, man.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.566
Let's just keep moving.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.211
I had the weirdest dream
when I was out.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.520
It... It was Christmas

29:08.640 --> 29:10.165
and my parents
were still alive and...

29:10.200 --> 29:11.645
Dream?

29:11.680 --> 29:13.125
Charlie, you died.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.171
Don't worry about it, though.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.850
You're not a real hunter
until you've died

29:17.880 --> 29:18.961
and come back again.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.206
Slow down.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.561
Why would you think I died?

29:22.640 --> 29:23.801
Heaven?

29:23.840 --> 29:25.649
It's your dream life.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.808
And if you were zapped
by the Wicked Witch,

29:27.840 --> 29:29.001
instant death.
I would know.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.041
She killed me too.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.526
Okay.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.886
Let's rewind here a bit.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.411
When did you die?

29:35.480 --> 29:36.641
In Oz.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.563
My father was obsessed
with his work

29:40.640 --> 29:41.880
as a Man of Letters.

29:41.920 --> 29:46.209
And then I was born
and nothing changed.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.931
He would keep his work a secret,

29:49.000 --> 29:49.922
but I was such a curious kid.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.843
I was always
looking for trouble,

29:51.880 --> 29:53.370
looking
for the next big adventure.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.368
- I know the feeling.
- Hm.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.323
I stowed away
on one of his cases.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.885
Wound up in the Emerald City.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.127
Accidentally got left behind.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.407
It was terrifying.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.323
Well, what happened?

30:05.400 --> 30:07.402
I met up with
these three freedom fighters.

30:07.440 --> 30:10.410
And they thought
I was this child of destiny,

30:10.440 --> 30:12.681
chosen to kill the Wicked Witch.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.688
They protected me.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.451
And then the Witch
turned them into...

30:17.520 --> 30:19.727
A Scarecrow,
a Tin Man and a Lion?

30:21.920 --> 30:23.684
And then she hunted me down.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.687
And killed me.

30:24.720 --> 30:29.567
Yeah, that never
made it to the books.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.081
Sometimes real life
is darker than fiction.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.045
Hey, why haven't you moved in?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.242
Is now really the time
for this, Dean?

30:44.360 --> 30:45.964
Well, just asking.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.327
Look, I never had what you had
with Mom and Dad, okay?

30:48.400 --> 30:49.890
What are you talking about?

30:49.920 --> 30:51.604
I don't have
any memories of home.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.001
And whenever I've tried
to make a home of my own,

30:54.120 --> 30:56.282
it really hasn't ended well.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.125
Yeah, but a lifetime
of abandoned buildings

30:59.160 --> 31:00.160
and crappy motel rooms?

31:00.200 --> 31:01.565
I mean, this is about
as close to a home

31:01.600 --> 31:02.931
as we're gonna get.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.286
And it's ours.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.121
And what about the books?

31:13.160 --> 31:15.447
Revisionist history.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.040
That's my father's way
of trying to undo

31:17.080 --> 31:18.002
what had happened to me.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.686
But I knew the truth.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.770
When the Witch
came to our world,

31:26.800 --> 31:27.801
I became a Hunter

31:27.880 --> 31:29.928
and my father
wrote those silly books.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.485
Don't you get it?

31:31.520 --> 31:33.648
The books aren't silly,
they're guide books,

31:33.680 --> 31:35.648
filled with clues
he left for you.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.165
Haggerty
poured through each one,

31:37.240 --> 31:39.322
and his research led him
to uncover the poppies.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.483
So maybe there's something else
from the books we can use.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.440
Preferably something
with a pointy end.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.006
You are a genius.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.046
Come on.
We've got to get to the garage.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.122
There's a garage in this place?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.924
Oh, boy!

31:58.640 --> 32:00.483
Clear!

32:00.520 --> 32:02.648
I got nothing!

32:02.680 --> 32:03.681
What do you think?

32:03.720 --> 32:04.721
Is she gone?

32:09.520 --> 32:10.681
Sam!

32:27.000 --> 32:28.445
Find the girls.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.767
And kill them both.

32:40.880 --> 32:45.329
Yes, I knew those boy
scouts would keep it for me.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.207
Is that...

32:57.240 --> 32:59.242
Yeah.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.320
He didn't make it.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.081
Yes!

33:09.680 --> 33:11.284
I don't believe it.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.204
Did you really
walk down a brick road in these?

33:14.240 --> 33:15.890
No, I never actually wore them.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.888
Seemed kind of tacky
wearing a dead woman's shoes.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.048
Plus, I'm no good in heels,
you know?

33:20.080 --> 33:21.764
I don't suppose
we could just wish her away.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.767
Sorry.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.926
Another thing
the books got wrong.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.925
But like the poppies,
these have magic from Oz.

33:28.000 --> 33:28.922
Sharp magic.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.207
Hm... Death by shoe.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.730
There you are.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.082
Was that your Batman voice?

33:39.920 --> 33:41.649
That's definitely
not your Batman voice.

33:41.720 --> 33:42.801
It's her.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.650
She possessed the both of them.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.768
I've missed you, my pretty.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.404
Killing you a second time

33:48.440 --> 33:50.329
will be just
as sweet as the first.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.447
Guys.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.568
I know you're in there.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.728
Dean, you can't
let the Witch do this.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.371
If she opens the door,
she's going to destroy Oz.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.963
I have no intention
of escaping to Oz.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.804
I'm going to bring
my armies here.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.685
Don't worry.

35:11.720 --> 35:15.441
You'll join Dorothy
right after you watch her die.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.409
Sorry about the nards, Dean.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.167
Go.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.850
I'll buy you some time.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.486
All right.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.847
Let's see what you
pencil necks are made of.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.488
All right, let's do this
the old fashioned way.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.762
My body cannot hurt you,
Dorothy.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.447
But theirs can.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.122
Now heel.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.522
What the hell just happened?

36:35.600 --> 36:36.761
Charlie.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.644
Ding-dong, bitches.

38:00.720 --> 38:01.720
Ah!

38:04.640 --> 38:07.211
Really?

38:07.280 --> 38:11.046
After all I did
with Miss Defying Gravity?

38:20.880 --> 38:22.564
Bollocks.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.729
Baby looks good in here, huh?

38:33.760 --> 38:35.603
Not bad.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.205
Dean.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.207
Dorothy.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.447
I... I found something
in the archives.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.760
I'm sure belongs to you.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.609
You have no idea how odd it is

38:46.680 --> 38:49.081
having a series of books
written about you.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.491
Actually, I do know.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.130
And it is definitely weird.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.202
But you know what?
End of the day,

38:54.240 --> 38:56.322
it's our story.
So we get to write it.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.046
So.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.286
Thanks for the slumber party.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.649
And for bringing me
back from the dead.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.326
Uh, I didn't.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.926
Don't BS a BSer.

39:10.960 --> 39:11.961
Am I a zombie now?

39:12.040 --> 39:13.246
Do I need to eat brains?

39:13.280 --> 39:14.611
No.
No.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.483
No.
You're you.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.324
You're gonna be fine, all right?

39:18.400 --> 39:20.084
Just, um...

39:20.120 --> 39:22.043
Just keep this between us, okay?

39:22.120 --> 39:24.691
All right.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.921
But only because
you raised me from the dead,

39:25.960 --> 39:28.247
which you're going
to have to explain to me later.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.441
All right.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.765
Not bad
for a bunch of Librarians.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.080
Hm.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.009
Mind keeping an eye
on my bike for me?

39:37.080 --> 39:38.286
Yeah.
Yeah.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.327
As long as you don't mind me

39:39.400 --> 39:41.080
taking it for a spin
every once in a while.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.281
Deal.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.762
Thank you.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.961
For everything.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.526
Now if you'll excuse me,

39:48.600 --> 39:51.763
I have a rebellion to finish.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.848
So you coming or what?

39:53.920 --> 39:56.400
What?
With you?

39:58.120 --> 39:59.201
To Oz?

39:59.280 --> 40:00.884
Yeah, you said
you were looking for adventure.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.161
Well, here it is, Red.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.611
Come help me find my damn dog.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.608
You have no idea what's in Oz.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.290
I mean, there's...
there's flying monkeys.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.322
Armies of witches.
There's all kinds of danger.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.680
Promise?

40:17.840 --> 40:19.683
If you need anything, just...

40:19.720 --> 40:21.563
tap your heels together
three times, okay?

40:21.640 --> 40:22.641
Me?

40:22.680 --> 40:24.842
What about you crazy kids?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.200
You gonna be all right
without me?
