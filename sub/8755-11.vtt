00:10.499 --> 00:13.527
This is weird. There's a problem here.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.512
She turned her head, and it
was like this demonic face.

00:15.614 --> 00:19.716
Big impact in
his stomach. Ooh, ooh!

00:19.818 --> 00:21.584
Do they execute this rat [bleep]?

00:21.686 --> 00:22.785
They do.

00:22.888 --> 00:24.187
He ruins people.

00:24.289 --> 00:25.722
He caused a lot of people to die.

00:25.824 --> 00:29.192
I feel like there's a
presence inside this house.

00:29.294 --> 00:32.795
They're, like, trying to fight for life.

00:32.898 --> 00:35.498
Trying to run from death.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.934
There's a dark presence.

00:38.036 --> 00:40.003
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.105 --> 00:42.272
These things, they're freaking out.

00:42.374 --> 00:43.506
They're from hell.

00:43.608 --> 00:44.507
I see dead people.

00:44.609 --> 00:45.942
They were being hunted.

00:46.044 --> 00:47.577
I speak to dead people.

00:47.679 --> 00:50.613
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

00:50.715 --> 00:52.015
And they speak to me.

00:52.117 --> 00:53.383
Her neck got broken.

00:53.485 --> 00:56.386
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.488 --> 00:58.288
I hear a gunshot.

00:58.390 --> 00:59.556
I rely on my partner.

00:59.658 --> 01:00.823
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:00.926 --> 01:03.560
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:03.662 --> 01:04.694
Something's not right here.

01:04.796 --> 01:08.231
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.767
It's not safe here. It's
my job to reveal them.

01:10.869 --> 01:12.235
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:12.337 --> 01:13.636
They're all buried here.

01:13.738 --> 01:15.505
But Steve and I never speak.

01:15.607 --> 01:17.674
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.776 --> 01:19.008
Until the very end.

01:19.110 --> 01:20.276
I can't do it no more.

01:20.378 --> 01:22.579
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:22.681 --> 01:23.947
Holy [bleep] Look at this!

01:24.049 --> 01:25.448
Or time to get out.

01:25.550 --> 01:27.116
It does not have a happy ending.

01:27.219 --> 01:28.982
Something kills people here.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

01:43.535 --> 01:45.086
I'm in Richmond Heights, Ohio,

01:45.186 --> 01:47.419
it's a small town about
15 miles east of Cleveland.

01:47.954 --> 01:49.888
I got a call from a woman named Annette.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.657
She's a feisty lady,
not scared of anything...

01:52.759 --> 01:54.459
except what's in her house.

01:54.561 --> 01:56.661
She says what's going
on has gotten so bad,

01:56.763 --> 01:59.531
it's ripping her large family apart.

01:59.633 --> 02:00.698
She sounded pretty upset,

02:00.800 --> 02:02.563
and I'm hoping we can help her out.

02:05.205 --> 02:06.371
Before Amy arrives,

02:06.473 --> 02:09.707
I clear the house of
any leading information.

02:09.809 --> 02:11.576
Family photos and religious items

02:11.678 --> 02:13.845
must be covered or removed.

02:13.947 --> 02:15.146
When I'm finished,

02:15.248 --> 02:17.315
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:25.674 --> 02:27.107
Oh, boy.

02:27.209 --> 02:29.476
There's a female.

02:29.578 --> 02:32.012
She is not mentally sound.

02:32.114 --> 02:37.217
And she's basically
screaming for her life.

02:37.319 --> 02:40.287
So she's always in the process of dying.

02:40.389 --> 02:44.491
And it's due to a
gunshot or a stab wound.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.977
I'm also seeing this dead teenage girl.

02:51.765 --> 02:53.799
Her hair is very long,

02:53.901 --> 02:55.801
and like, really dirty.

02:55.903 --> 02:59.004
And she is decomposing.

02:59.106 --> 03:04.576
What I see is a man in the shadows.

03:04.678 --> 03:06.645
She points to him, and she said,

03:06.747 --> 03:09.047
"You murdered me."

03:09.149 --> 03:12.551
And then I get a really super sharp pain

03:12.653 --> 03:15.153
right here in my neck.

03:15.256 --> 03:18.290
And I'm thinking, like,
he might have stabbed her.

03:25.636 --> 03:27.036
So, Annette,
you sounded really upset

03:27.138 --> 03:29.038
when we spoke on the phone.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.507
What the hell's going on?

03:31.609 --> 03:33.561
My family means everything to me,

03:33.661 --> 03:36.399
and this house is
tearing our family apart.

03:37.202 --> 03:39.135
I mean, I've always been a strong woman,

03:39.237 --> 03:40.295
and I always told everyone,

03:40.395 --> 03:44.564
"Do not mess with my husband,
my family, or my home."

03:44.666 --> 03:46.466
This is just something I can't handle.

03:46.568 --> 03:48.301
What exactly are people experiencing?

03:48.403 --> 03:54.140
From unexplained noises, sounds
of footsteps all over the house.

03:54.243 --> 03:55.775
Seeing apparitions,

03:55.878 --> 03:59.479
and, here, lately,
being physically touched.

03:59.581 --> 04:03.316
Okay. So who exactly lives here?

04:03.418 --> 04:05.685
Currently, just my husband and I.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.787
- I know you have a big family.
- I do.

04:07.890 --> 04:11.358
I have seven children
and 11 grandchildren.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.227
This is my family.

04:14.329 --> 04:16.863
WE have five daughters and two sons.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.231
How long have you guys lived here?

04:18.333 --> 04:19.866
For about 15 years now.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.435
What prompted you to
call us now, though?

04:22.537 --> 04:24.638
My son, who came home from the Army,

04:24.740 --> 04:26.339
he stayed with us for a while,

04:26.441 --> 04:29.476
but that activity increased so much,

04:29.578 --> 04:31.745
and he decided to leave.

04:31.847 --> 04:35.124
My grandchildren do not
want to spend the night here.

04:35.224 --> 04:37.324
If they come over,
it's during the daytime,

04:37.426 --> 04:40.294
and they're out of
here before nightfall.

04:40.396 --> 04:41.741
Annette, I'm curious about your husband.

04:43.090 --> 04:44.923
How's he feel about this whole thing?

04:45.026 --> 04:46.191
I called you guys,

04:46.294 --> 04:49.528
and, you know, it
started some arguments.

04:49.630 --> 04:52.631
This is his family, he should
be able to fix it, so...

04:52.733 --> 04:54.600
Is he okay with us being here?

04:54.702 --> 04:57.903
He knows I feel strongly about this.

04:58.005 --> 05:01.073
I need my life back,
I need my family back.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.608
I want my home back.

05:08.215 --> 05:11.216
My goodness.

05:11.319 --> 05:13.118
Okay.

05:13.220 --> 05:15.054
I'm getting a lot of people
talking to me at once.

05:15.156 --> 05:21.994
Somebody who lives here,
I think it's a male.

05:22.799 --> 05:24.799
There's somebody in this house

05:24.901 --> 05:28.403
who does not want us to be doing this,

05:28.505 --> 05:30.304
thinks it's bad,

05:30.407 --> 05:31.706
it's gonna stir [bleep] up.

05:31.808 --> 05:33.241
So this is a living person.

05:33.343 --> 05:34.409
Yeah. That's here.

05:34.511 --> 05:35.410
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:35.512 --> 05:37.278
He's a control freak,

05:37.380 --> 05:39.580
and he thinks he's got
it all under control

05:39.682 --> 05:42.150
and he's, like, the man of the house,

05:42.252 --> 05:43.684
and you know,

05:43.787 --> 05:45.853
he can protect his own kind of thing.

05:45.955 --> 05:47.855
Like, you know, I don't
need your guys' help.

05:47.957 --> 05:49.590
You don't need to be here.

05:56.654 --> 06:00.222
This is where some of the
worst experiences have happened.

06:00.325 --> 06:02.024
Okay, like what?

06:02.126 --> 06:05.344
At night, there's a male figure

06:05.444 --> 06:07.911
that I see standing in that hallway.

06:08.013 --> 06:10.347
And he stands there as though,

06:10.449 --> 06:13.183
he's, like, keeping guard or
watching over and looking in

06:13.285 --> 06:14.317
and checking in.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.719
Okay, is it something
you can see through

06:15.821 --> 06:17.587
- or is it solid?
- It's solid.

06:17.689 --> 06:20.657
It's like a dark man with all black on.

06:20.759 --> 06:22.125
You ever think about
shutting the door at night?

06:22.227 --> 06:23.693
No.

06:23.796 --> 06:26.096
You might want to start doing that.

06:26.198 --> 06:28.098
I don't want to be
locked in here with it.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.500
Mmm.

06:30.602 --> 06:31.535
All right, anything else?

06:31.637 --> 06:33.603
I hear this voice call my name.

06:33.705 --> 06:36.006
Several times, I've, like, responded,

06:36.108 --> 06:37.274
thinking it was someone here,

06:37.376 --> 06:39.810
and then realizing, "Wait a
minute, I'm here by myself."

06:39.912 --> 06:41.445
Is it a male voice or a female voice?

06:41.547 --> 06:43.046
Female voice.

06:43.148 --> 06:44.514
Could the TV have been on?

06:44.616 --> 06:45.882
No.

06:45.984 --> 06:47.851
Okay. Anything else?

06:47.953 --> 06:51.354
Yeah, another time, I
was laying in bed here,

06:51.457 --> 06:55.559
and this demonic female form was
sitting at the foot of my bed.

06:55.661 --> 07:00.230
I woke up and I saw it, 'cause
I felt it actually sit down.

07:00.332 --> 07:03.767
She turned her head, and it
was like this demonic face.

07:03.869 --> 07:08.171
Like, a beige tone, brown tone gargoyle.

07:08.273 --> 07:09.840
Okay.

07:09.942 --> 07:11.508
Like something out of a scary movie.

07:11.610 --> 07:17.047
It was just something
that was terrifying.

07:17.149 --> 07:21.651
The dead teenage
girl comes in here a lot.

07:21.753 --> 07:25.155
She likes it in here a lot.

07:25.257 --> 07:30.193
And there's a connection between
her and the person in this room.

07:30.295 --> 07:33.196
There is communication
there, 'cause I see, like,

07:33.298 --> 07:36.800
the dead girl, like sitting
here in the middle of the floor.

07:36.902 --> 07:39.703
And she's talking to somebody.

07:39.805 --> 07:41.204
There's a relationship.

07:41.306 --> 07:44.007
This is her safe space, her safe area.

07:44.109 --> 07:45.942
She really likes this person.

07:46.044 --> 07:49.145
But because she's dying all the time,

07:49.248 --> 07:54.951
this person might feel really
weird aches and pains...

07:55.053 --> 07:57.087
through their body, their joints.

07:57.189 --> 07:59.789
Obviously, it's not healthy.

07:59.892 --> 08:02.492
So it's almost like
she's becoming a zombie.

08:09.268 --> 08:11.101
So, William, I spoke to Annette.

08:11.203 --> 08:13.703
And she's still pretty upset
about the stuff going on.

08:13.805 --> 08:15.839
Are you happy we're here?

08:15.941 --> 08:16.706
No.

08:16.808 --> 08:17.307
Why?

08:17.409 --> 08:18.041
'Cause I didn't know

08:18.143 --> 08:19.676
nothing about you all.

08:19.778 --> 08:22.279
It could have made
something worse or, you know.

08:22.381 --> 08:23.446
Do you believe in any of this stuff?

08:23.549 --> 08:24.781
- Well, I do now.
- You do?

08:24.883 --> 08:26.983
Yes. So I gotta assume by that answer,

08:27.085 --> 08:28.985
- you've had experiences.
- Yes.

08:29.087 --> 08:30.086
Okay, can you tell
me about some of them?

08:30.188 --> 08:32.969
Okay, yeah, I was in
the basement watching TV.

08:33.068 --> 08:34.802
And out of the corner of my eyes,

08:34.904 --> 08:37.171
I seen a lady up on the wall,

08:37.273 --> 08:38.873
coming down the steps.

08:38.975 --> 08:40.174
What did she look like?

08:40.275 --> 08:43.678
She was a little short white
lady with long, white hair

08:43.780 --> 08:45.446
and a long, white gown.

08:45.548 --> 08:46.781
And she was walking up

08:46.883 --> 08:48.616
against the wall like this
and coming down the steps.

08:48.718 --> 08:49.917
And just looking at me like,

08:50.019 --> 08:52.987
"Do he see me?" It
ain't like I'm asleep.

08:53.089 --> 08:57.325
I'm sitting there looking at
her, and saying, "Oh, my God!"

08:57.427 --> 08:58.960
Man, that's a little strange.

08:59.062 --> 09:00.127
Anything else?

09:00.229 --> 09:02.129
One night, we were
sitting in the basement,

09:02.231 --> 09:05.399
and seemed like somebody
done broke in or something

09:05.501 --> 09:07.001
because this...

09:07.103 --> 09:09.370
it was so loud on that floor.

09:09.472 --> 09:10.905
We looked around.

09:11.007 --> 09:12.139
Nothing.

09:12.241 --> 09:13.641
- You guys have dogs?
- No.

09:13.743 --> 09:16.177
Okay, you ever check for rodents?

09:16.279 --> 09:18.512
- Uh, no.
- Okay.

09:18.614 --> 09:20.848
Um, so anything else?

09:20.950 --> 09:23.918
Yeah, I was coming down the
steps about 8:00 in the morning.

09:24.020 --> 09:26.487
And seen a body of flashing lights,

09:26.589 --> 09:29.557
like a thousand flashing
lights, all in one body,

09:29.659 --> 09:31.525
trickling, coming at me.

09:31.627 --> 09:32.927
Okay, so let me get
this description right.

09:33.029 --> 09:35.563
This is the first time I'm
hearing something like this.

09:35.665 --> 09:36.697
Okay. Big round...

09:36.799 --> 09:38.332
Round, like that, yeah.

09:38.434 --> 09:40.301
About as long as your body.

09:40.403 --> 09:41.502
- Really?
- Yes.

09:41.604 --> 09:43.471
Almost knocked me down
it scared me so bad.

09:49.445 --> 09:51.412
Oh, boy.

09:51.514 --> 09:55.683
I see, like, this guy, who,
I'm assuming, is not good.

09:59.255 --> 10:02.390
I don't know how he's
manifesting this weird light.

10:02.492 --> 10:04.658
And I think that the living

10:04.761 --> 10:09.630
would probably see this weird light.

10:09.732 --> 10:11.665
It wouldn't be like the whole room

10:11.768 --> 10:13.234
would be filled with this light,

10:13.336 --> 10:16.137
it would be like kind of a cut-out.

10:21.278 --> 10:26.648
So, the guy from outside,
this guy in the light,

10:26.750 --> 10:29.718
he's in here.

10:29.820 --> 10:32.554
He ruins people.

10:32.656 --> 10:33.855
How.

10:34.332 --> 10:37.767
He does, like, an analysis
of the people in the house,

10:37.869 --> 10:39.669
and then he just takes

10:39.771 --> 10:41.137
whatever's most valuable to them.

10:41.239 --> 10:44.418
So if a man's wife

10:44.518 --> 10:47.486
is the most valuable
thing, he'll destroy that.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.725
He wants out of here, and
he can't get out of here.

10:52.827 --> 10:55.127
I guess he thinks this is his hell.

11:18.009 --> 11:20.142
Mom said that you had
recently moved back,

11:20.244 --> 11:22.278
but then you moved
out. What was the story?

11:22.380 --> 11:25.014
I had a tour over in Afghanistan,

11:25.116 --> 11:27.950
and when I had got back, I
was here about five months.

11:28.052 --> 11:30.119
Now, did you leave because of
what's going on in the house?

11:30.221 --> 11:31.320
- Yes.
- Explain to me how

11:31.422 --> 11:33.555
a guy like you, who's
been in combat conditions,

11:33.658 --> 11:34.957
could be driven out of a house.

11:35.059 --> 11:37.459
Well, one time I was laying in bed,

11:37.561 --> 11:41.664
and I heard a conversation
going on between two females.

11:41.766 --> 11:43.165
Were you able to make
out what they were saying?

11:43.267 --> 11:44.900
I was not able to make
out what they were saying.

11:45.002 --> 11:46.969
It sounded like a real
muffled conversation.

11:47.071 --> 11:49.672
I thought that maybe my mom
had stayed home from work.

11:49.774 --> 11:50.839
Okay, was Mom home?

11:50.942 --> 11:51.874
No, no one was home.

11:51.976 --> 11:53.542
Okay, what about the TV being on?

11:53.644 --> 11:55.177
Then that was my second thought.

11:55.279 --> 11:58.380
Until I opened my door
to use the restroom

11:58.482 --> 12:01.717
and the conversation between
the two females stopped.

12:01.819 --> 12:03.352
Okay, anything else?

12:03.454 --> 12:06.622
There feels like there's a
presence inside this house

12:06.724 --> 12:08.090
at certain times.

12:08.192 --> 12:10.192
I'd say when I'm walking up the stairs,

12:10.294 --> 12:11.894
I feel like something's behind me.

12:11.996 --> 12:14.897
Feels like something is
immediately coming after me.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.131
There's been many instances

12:16.233 --> 12:19.201
where I've slept outside in the car.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.670
Yeah, I don't want to
be inside this house.

12:21.772 --> 12:23.172
All right, so let me ask you a question,

12:23.274 --> 12:24.640
- would you sleep here alone?
- No, never.

12:24.742 --> 12:27.509
I wouldn't stay a
night here again...

12:27.611 --> 12:28.711
with our without people here.

12:28.813 --> 12:30.185
So it's not happening.

12:35.152 --> 12:36.758
The two murdered women are in here,

12:36.858 --> 12:38.791
and they're literally,

12:38.893 --> 12:43.062
like, pacing around
at the end of this bed.

12:43.164 --> 12:45.097
The living can see them,

12:45.199 --> 12:49.235
and the one who's crazy

12:49.337 --> 12:52.338
is making these people crazy.

12:53.134 --> 12:55.000
That would be like, you know,

12:55.102 --> 13:00.973
loss of focus, hearing
voices, hallucinations.

13:01.075 --> 13:05.578
Extreme depression
Extreme depression.

13:13.721 --> 13:15.120
So, Nikki, I was talking to Mom.

13:15.223 --> 13:16.989
It's heartbreaking listening
to her talk about how family

13:17.091 --> 13:19.325
is just torn apart by
what's going on here.

13:19.427 --> 13:20.659
Nobody wants to come here.

13:20.761 --> 13:22.528
Nobody wants to come here.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.697
We travel from Georgia to come up here,

13:24.799 --> 13:27.566
- and usually we just get a hotel.
- Really?

13:27.668 --> 13:31.403
We'd rather pay money to go to a hotel

13:31.505 --> 13:33.205
then to stay in this house.

13:33.307 --> 13:34.740
Okay, so it sounds like you've had

13:34.842 --> 13:36.208
some pretty bad experiences here.

13:36.310 --> 13:37.476
Yeah.

13:37.578 --> 13:39.078
I just get the feeling of panic

13:39.180 --> 13:40.679
when I walk into this house.

13:40.781 --> 13:43.315
It's this feeling of being overwhelmed

13:43.417 --> 13:47.519
when you know that
something might just happen.

13:47.622 --> 13:49.488
- I'm nervous now.
- I can see it.

13:49.590 --> 13:51.090
It feels like I need to leave,

13:51.192 --> 13:52.625
like something was just,

13:52.727 --> 13:54.994
like, "Get out of this house."

13:55.096 --> 13:57.529
But have you actually
experienced anything?

13:57.632 --> 13:59.413
I was would sleep in the den,

13:59.513 --> 14:01.747
and I woke up from out of my sleep,

14:01.849 --> 14:04.283
and I saw something come downstairs.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.584
It was this tall man.

14:05.686 --> 14:07.922
When I saw him, we looked at each other,

14:08.022 --> 14:10.923
and then he backed up, then
went back up the stairs.

14:11.025 --> 14:12.658
Could you describe what he looked like?

14:12.760 --> 14:15.060
Tall guy. He might have been white.

14:15.162 --> 14:16.795
Maybe his fifties.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.230
You don't have to, you know,

14:18.332 --> 14:20.732
keep scaring me in
order for me to get it.

14:20.835 --> 14:23.492
I get it, I saw you,
you saw me, it's... no.

14:23.592 --> 14:24.491
Game over.

14:24.593 --> 14:26.426
That's it.

14:26.528 --> 14:27.761
I want everybody to be safe.

14:27.863 --> 14:29.630
I want this thing out of here.

14:32.401 --> 14:34.535
Hmm.

14:34.637 --> 14:36.503
Hmm.

14:36.606 --> 14:38.839
It's a male.

14:38.941 --> 14:40.274
This is like a panic.

14:40.376 --> 14:42.653
I'm so panicked.

14:44.852 --> 14:46.819
Panicked, panicked.

14:47.641 --> 14:49.541
Trying to fight for life.

14:49.643 --> 14:50.775
Trying to fight death.

14:50.878 --> 14:53.678
Trying to run from death.

14:53.780 --> 14:56.681
It's awful. My brain is being affected.

14:56.783 --> 14:58.817
I can't talk right.

14:58.919 --> 15:04.389
Feel sick, horrible, nauseous.

15:04.491 --> 15:08.693
I think the living would feel this.

15:08.795 --> 15:12.197
They would feel massive
amounts of panic down here.

15:12.299 --> 15:15.200
And then feeling like impending doom.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.942
Oh, yeah, it feels worse in here.

15:24.044 --> 15:25.710
Oof! Ooh!

15:25.812 --> 15:29.314
I don't understand
anybody coming down here.

15:29.416 --> 15:34.319
There's like a crushing, crushing pain.

15:35.389 --> 15:36.489
Oh, God!

15:49.307 --> 15:51.474
Annette and William didn't
know much history about their home,

15:51.576 --> 15:53.276
so I made some calls,
and I found out a woman

15:53.378 --> 15:56.197
suffering from Alzheimer's
used to live in their house.

15:56.297 --> 15:58.698
In fact, I managed to track
down the woman's pastor,

15:58.800 --> 16:00.533
who says he knew her
and has some information

16:00.635 --> 16:02.668
that will definitely help my case.

16:08.143 --> 16:10.843
Pastor Hill, thanks for
meeting me, I appreciate that.

16:10.945 --> 16:13.546
The house I'm investigating, you
had mentioned the previous owner

16:13.648 --> 16:15.848
was actually a member
of your church here.

16:15.950 --> 16:17.850
Yes. So, Pastor, do you have any idea

16:17.952 --> 16:19.986
when she moved into the
house I'm investigating?

16:20.088 --> 16:22.121
Yes, Eleanor moved in in 1973

16:22.223 --> 16:26.159
when she met and married
Valentine Carpozi.

16:26.261 --> 16:28.961
Tragically, five years
into their marriage,

16:29.063 --> 16:31.831
he has a massive heart attack
on the living room floor,

16:31.933 --> 16:36.169
and then one hour later,
at the hospital, he dies.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.704
I can almost guarantee you he
was already dead in the house

16:38.807 --> 16:42.642
and they just moved him to the
hospital for the family's sake.

16:42.744 --> 16:48.047
Young guy,
too... only 66.

16:48.149 --> 16:51.551
That dead guy who
was trying to fight death

16:51.653 --> 16:54.020
died down here.

16:54.122 --> 16:56.055
And this was recent.

16:56.157 --> 16:58.090
This person died recently.

16:58.193 --> 16:59.225
So I think he's older.

16:59.327 --> 17:03.029
I think he's maybe in his sixties.

17:03.131 --> 17:05.998
I think he was 68.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.707
I want to say that this
guy, like, owned this house.

17:08.807 --> 17:11.406
He knew he was gonna die,
and he was trying to fight it,

17:11.509 --> 17:14.143
and he was, like, running
from place to place to try to,

17:14.244 --> 17:18.047
I guess, outrun death or something.

17:18.148 --> 17:19.315
Do you know how he died?

17:19.416 --> 17:20.983
Maybe a stroke.

17:21.086 --> 17:24.753
Can't move his jaw,
can't speak really well.

17:24.856 --> 17:27.656
His brain feels weird,
and he feels nauseous.

17:27.759 --> 17:29.792
This is not good. This is really bad.

17:29.894 --> 17:35.431
Like, he's making people
very, very, very, very sick.

17:38.192 --> 17:39.558
Eleanor, did she ever re-marry?

17:39.660 --> 17:40.659
No.

17:40.761 --> 17:42.194
Okay, so how long did she
stay in the house alone?

17:42.296 --> 17:43.929
21 years by herself.

17:44.031 --> 17:44.996
What kind of woman was she?

17:45.099 --> 17:46.598
She was here every Sunday.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.501
Her faith was what got her through.

17:49.603 --> 17:50.736
What kind of a church is this?

17:50.838 --> 17:53.004
It's kind of not like any other.

17:53.107 --> 17:56.108
We do communicate with the dead.

17:56.210 --> 18:00.145
You help patrons of the church
communicate with the dead?

18:00.247 --> 18:02.647
- Yes.
- Wow.

18:02.750 --> 18:03.849
Pastor, let me ask you a question.

18:03.951 --> 18:05.584
The people that come
here, the congregation,

18:05.686 --> 18:09.254
do you think they all
have psychic abilities?

18:09.356 --> 18:12.157
We all are born with the abilities,

18:12.259 --> 18:14.760
and the people come
here to develop them.

18:14.862 --> 18:16.061
Okay, now, what about Eleanor?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.729
Do we know if she had any abilities?

18:17.831 --> 18:18.830
Yes.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.265
Eleanor would always
sit in the front here.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.600
She was a believer.

18:21.702 --> 18:24.002
Okay, so now you said she
lived there for 21 years.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.537
Did she die in the
house I'm investigating?

18:25.639 --> 18:29.641
No. In the '90s, she was
diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

18:29.743 --> 18:32.077
In fear of her safety, in 1999,

18:32.179 --> 18:35.147
they put her into an
assisted living facility.

18:35.249 --> 18:36.782
When does she eventually pass away?

18:36.884 --> 18:39.684
- December 29, 2001.
- Okay.

18:39.787 --> 18:42.621
And I actually have
her death certificate.

18:42.723 --> 18:44.189
Okay, do we know what she died of?

18:44.291 --> 18:45.757
- Cardiac arrest.
- She did.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.192
In the nursing home.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.996
Okay.

18:51.098 --> 18:55.233
What?

18:55.335 --> 18:56.568
The [bleep]?

18:56.670 --> 19:01.006
I see leashes from a woman

19:01.108 --> 19:03.608
to the two dead women.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.111
Interesting.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.412
I'm mad.

19:07.514 --> 19:11.116
Somebody here messed
with either a Ouija board

19:11.218 --> 19:14.486
or some seance...
some kind of [bleep].

19:14.588 --> 19:16.855
Might be practicing witchcraft.

19:16.957 --> 19:20.425
And they have now basically enslaved

19:20.527 --> 19:23.462
these two dead people...
these two dead females.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.767
William told me he hears
footsteps in the house

19:27.869 --> 19:29.233
all the time.

19:29.637 --> 19:31.237
Now, sometimes people

19:31.339 --> 19:33.005
start blaming everything
on the paranormal.

19:33.107 --> 19:34.740
It could just be rodents.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.275
I'm heading back to the
house now to meet with

19:36.377 --> 19:38.877
a pest control expert to see
if that could be the case.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.958
Well, Jessie, thanks for
meeting me, I appreciate that.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.993
Everybody in the house
is hearing footsteps.

19:47.095 --> 19:49.762
Have you ever encountered a place

19:49.864 --> 19:50.997
where it could be some kind

19:51.099 --> 19:53.066
of an animal that could
make a noise like that?

19:53.168 --> 19:56.436
Usually, mostly, that's what it is.

19:56.538 --> 19:58.137
Now, what kind of an
animal are we talking about?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.707
- Raccoons, possums.
- Okay.

20:00.809 --> 20:01.808
Family of squirrels.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.043
Okay, so if you can
find evidence of that,

20:04.145 --> 20:07.513
at least I could tell them
this is why you're hearing this.

20:07.616 --> 20:08.982
So if you can get to work on it for me,

20:09.084 --> 20:10.450
and I'll get back with
you when you're done.

20:10.552 --> 20:11.884
- I could sure do that for you.
- Okay, excellent.

20:11.987 --> 20:12.885
- Thank you, buddy.
- You got it.

20:12.988 --> 20:14.187
- Appreciate it. Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

20:16.197 --> 20:17.229
With all the bizarre sounds

20:17.331 --> 20:18.862
Annette and William are hearing,

20:18.962 --> 20:22.830
I know I have to rule
out the obvious first.

20:22.933 --> 20:24.666
And if there isn't a
physical explanation,

20:24.768 --> 20:27.235
our only hope for answers
will have to come from Amy.

20:27.337 --> 20:28.670
All right, Jessie, so what's the story?

20:28.772 --> 20:32.440
I found zero signs of
activity during my inspection.

20:32.542 --> 20:35.109
Okay, so there's no chance

20:35.212 --> 20:37.512
that what they're hearing is
caused by any kind of wildlife.

20:37.614 --> 20:39.113
Steve, I'm 100% sure.

20:39.216 --> 20:40.682
I appreciate you help
and time. Thank you.

20:40.784 --> 20:43.851
Not a problem at all.

20:44.645 --> 20:46.177
The guy from outside...

20:46.280 --> 20:49.714
the dead guy with lights
is acting really strange.

20:49.816 --> 20:54.452
He smushed himself
down, like, to this tall.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.857
Flat.

20:58.959 --> 21:02.327
And then it gets really loud.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.397
It's super, super loud.

21:09.603 --> 21:12.337
When he does that, it's a problem.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.705
What do you mean?

21:13.807 --> 21:15.674
It's a problem because

21:15.776 --> 21:19.778
the dead ladies freak out.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.417
Like, it's like everything is going nuts

21:25.519 --> 21:28.186
because all the other dead
people are losing their minds.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.088
What kind of effect would all this chaos

21:30.190 --> 21:31.323
have on the living?

21:31.425 --> 21:33.858
I think they would hear voices,

21:33.961 --> 21:39.998
and there would be, like, a
lot of the feeling of movement.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.067
Like a lot of people moving around.

21:42.169 --> 21:45.937
And so there's all this
pandemonium happening.

21:52.595 --> 21:54.144
If you need us to investigate

21:54.244 --> 21:55.877
unexplained activity in your home,

21:55.979 --> 21:58.246
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

21:58.348 --> 22:00.148
Click on "Help Me, Dead Files"

22:00.250 --> 22:01.917
to submit your story,
and we'll help if we can.

22:09.185 --> 22:11.683
So far, I've got a
family being terrorized in a home

22:11.783 --> 22:14.068
whose former owner died
of a massive heart attack,

22:14.168 --> 22:15.201
leaving behind a widow

22:15.303 --> 22:17.536
who believed she could
speak to the dead.

22:17.639 --> 22:18.838
But I need to see if
there's anything else

22:18.940 --> 22:21.907
that can help my investigation.

22:22.010 --> 22:23.209
Searching through old records,

22:23.311 --> 22:26.012
I come across a gangster
named Athay Brown.

22:26.114 --> 22:27.146
Turns out his gang

22:27.248 --> 22:28.914
was responsible for the death of a woman

22:29.017 --> 22:33.085
less than a hundred yards
from my clients' property.

22:33.187 --> 22:35.121
Look, when I want to know
the facts about a murder,

22:35.223 --> 22:37.657
there's only one source
I really trust, the cops.

22:37.759 --> 22:40.126
So I'm on my way to meet with
a Cleveland homicide detective

22:40.228 --> 22:42.061
who looked into it for me, and he says

22:42.163 --> 22:44.897
Brown was one of the most
violent and notorious murders

22:44.999 --> 22:46.532
in Cleveland's history.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.640
So I know you looked
into this local gangster.

22:54.742 --> 22:56.375
What can you tell me about the case?

22:56.477 --> 22:58.944
Almost right next door
to your client's property,

22:59.047 --> 23:00.513
there lived a lady named Kerri Sykes.

23:00.615 --> 23:04.350
She was a 63-year-old lady
who claimed to be a psychic.

23:04.452 --> 23:05.651
And she did readings for people.

23:05.753 --> 23:08.120
Well, on August 30, 1932,

23:08.222 --> 23:11.490
Kerri Sykes is at home
with an elderly friend...

23:11.592 --> 23:12.858
a 72-year-old
widow,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.428
and these four gangsters
knock on her door.

23:15.530 --> 23:18.464
And they tell them that they're
looking to have a reading.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.532
Athay brown is one of the gang leaders.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.167
Now, you said he was one of Cleveland's

23:23.269 --> 23:25.102
- most dangerous gangsters.
- Yes.

23:25.204 --> 23:29.673
They had done 40 or more
robberies in the Cleveland area

23:29.776 --> 23:31.675
during a six-month period.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.678
They were involved in four murders.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.580
So what happened?

23:36.682 --> 23:38.382
Once she lets them in the house,

23:38.484 --> 23:40.217
they produce pistols,

23:40.319 --> 23:42.686
and they force the women into
the basement and tie them up.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.422
And then begin to ransack the house.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.459
Well, Kerri was able to free
herself and free her companion.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.413
She boosts the
72-year-old lady

23:50.513 --> 23:53.715
up in the basement and
out the basement window.

23:53.815 --> 23:56.583
So the 72-year-old now
is able to run for help.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.018
And now Kerri finds
herself alone in basement,

23:59.120 --> 24:01.054
and she starts to have a panic attack,

24:01.156 --> 24:03.323
and actually causes her
to have a heart attack,

24:03.425 --> 24:05.258
and she dies right
there in the basement.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.960
How does he wind up getting caught?

24:07.062 --> 24:10.463
Well, he actually doesn't get
caught for Kerri Sykes' death.

24:10.565 --> 24:11.864
A few weeks later,

24:11.967 --> 24:14.100
he thinks that one of
the members of his gang

24:14.202 --> 24:17.136
is talking to the police about
him, and he gets paranoid.

24:17.239 --> 24:18.538
So him and another gang member

24:18.640 --> 24:20.740
sneak into the snitch's house one night.

24:20.842 --> 24:22.175
And while the snitch

24:22.277 --> 24:27.313
is sleeping with his 20-year-old
pregnant wife, they open fire.

24:27.415 --> 24:29.882
They miss the snitch, but
they killed the pregnant wife.

24:29.985 --> 24:31.851
- Oh, [bleep].
- Francine Holt...

24:31.953 --> 24:36.356
and I was able to find a copy
of her death certificate for you.

24:36.458 --> 24:37.757
So he jumps back on a train

24:37.859 --> 24:40.059
and heads back to Cleveland,
and the Cleveland police

24:40.161 --> 24:42.328
had been alerted at that time,
and they were waiting for him,

24:42.430 --> 24:43.763
and they arrested him
when he got off the train.

24:43.865 --> 24:45.331
He goes to trial, I guess?

24:45.433 --> 24:46.599
Yes, he goes to trial

24:46.701 --> 24:49.636
for the murder of the
20-year-old pregnant lady,

24:49.738 --> 24:51.271
and he's found guilty of that,

24:51.373 --> 24:52.772
and he gets sentenced to death.

24:52.874 --> 24:54.741
Do they execute this rat [bleep]?

24:54.843 --> 24:56.109
They do.

24:56.211 --> 24:59.212
Within a year of Kerri Sykes' death,

24:59.314 --> 25:01.848
Athay Brown was put to death
in the Ohio Penitentiary

25:01.950 --> 25:03.316
at the age of 27.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.184
Good. He deserved it.

25:11.007 --> 25:12.039
The guy from
outside...

25:12.141 --> 25:15.042
this guy in the light...

25:15.144 --> 25:18.946
he's in here.

25:19.048 --> 25:22.850
Whatever he did, he ruined people.

25:22.952 --> 25:24.785
He, like, took [bleep]

25:26.105 --> 25:29.140
And he would ruin
them, like, financially.

25:29.242 --> 25:30.374
Then there was a major thing

25:30.476 --> 25:33.945
that actually killed a lot of people.

25:34.047 --> 25:36.154
And it ruined him.

25:36.182 --> 25:41.152
The dead teenage girl, he killed her.

25:41.254 --> 25:42.987
He's damned because of what he did.

25:43.089 --> 25:45.156
He caused a lot of people to die.

25:51.064 --> 25:52.964
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

25:53.066 --> 25:54.832
but two stood out the most.

25:54.935 --> 25:57.168
First, the old man in the basement.

25:57.270 --> 25:59.304
He has thick, white hair,

25:59.406 --> 26:02.740
and it's parted.

26:02.842 --> 26:08.446
His nose was very, very large.

26:08.548 --> 26:10.682
Next, I describe the dead teenage girl

26:10.784 --> 26:12.850
talking to a living woman.

26:12.953 --> 26:15.553
It was in a bedroom.

26:20.293 --> 26:22.727
She is in the process of decomposing.

26:26.634 --> 26:29.635
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:29.737 --> 26:31.403
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:51.199 --> 26:54.005
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:54.105 --> 26:55.471
we're ready to reveal our findings

26:55.573 --> 26:57.073
to each other and our clients

26:57.175 --> 26:58.341
for the first time.

26:58.443 --> 27:02.378
Well, Amy, this is William
and this is Annette.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.881
These guys are all about
one thing... family...

27:04.983 --> 27:06.048
and they have a big one,

27:06.151 --> 27:08.885
seven kids, including Nikki here,

27:08.987 --> 27:11.587
and 11 grandchildren.

27:11.689 --> 27:13.456
And that's the reason they called us in.

27:13.558 --> 27:15.291
The activity here is so bad,

27:15.393 --> 27:17.493
it's tearing the family apart.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.862
No one wants to be here,

27:19.964 --> 27:22.465
and the kids are worried
that Annette and William

27:22.567 --> 27:23.933
are in danger.

27:24.035 --> 27:25.835
Now that Amy knows a
little bit about you guys,

27:25.937 --> 27:27.906
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk.

27:32.075 --> 27:33.908
So the worst place
for me in the house

27:34.010 --> 27:36.711
was when I went into the basement

27:36.813 --> 27:38.679
and I became, like,

27:38.782 --> 27:42.750
extremely anxious and,
like, overwhelming panic.

27:42.852 --> 27:45.019
And I saw this man there.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.055
And he apparently is,

27:47.157 --> 27:50.654
like, reliving his death
over and over and over again.

27:51.027 --> 27:54.429
I didn't know how anybody
could go down there and,

27:54.531 --> 27:55.997
like, do laundry or anything

27:56.099 --> 27:59.167
because his energy is so negative.

27:59.269 --> 28:01.436
You just feel horrible.

28:01.538 --> 28:04.165
And also I think that

28:04.265 --> 28:07.666
anybody alive would
feel extremely drained,

28:07.768 --> 28:11.503
and they would feel like a
sense of, like, impending doom.

28:11.606 --> 28:15.174
A lot of our family have had
experiences in the basement

28:15.276 --> 28:18.041
in seeing a man in that area.

28:18.223 --> 28:20.123
I was in the basement,

28:20.225 --> 28:21.357
and I woke up,

28:21.459 --> 28:23.760
and I saw this man
coming down the stairs.

28:23.862 --> 28:25.161
And you were sleeping down there?

28:25.263 --> 28:26.829
That was it for me.

28:26.931 --> 28:29.165
I think that things like that only

28:29.267 --> 28:32.035
happen to people in the movies,

28:32.137 --> 28:35.405
and it's terrifying to
even see it and feel it...

28:35.507 --> 28:39.609
and to be in your family's
house and experience it.

28:39.711 --> 28:41.477
All right, so we know this
guy's causing problems.

28:41.579 --> 28:43.112
Any idea who he was?

28:43.214 --> 28:47.550
I thought that
this man owns this house,

28:47.652 --> 28:51.454
that he died in the house.

28:51.556 --> 28:53.056
I'm not sure how he died,

28:53.158 --> 28:56.726
but I was feeling like
an aneurysm or a stroke.

28:56.828 --> 28:59.429
I got that he was
within the last 30 years.

28:59.531 --> 29:02.398
He was 68 years old when he died.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.533
Wow.

29:03.635 --> 29:07.070
- And he had thick, white hair.
- Wow.

29:07.172 --> 29:09.672
I don't have to think
too long about this one.

29:09.774 --> 29:12.342
Now you said the guy
you saw owned the home,

29:12.444 --> 29:16.112
died in the home, and
died at the age of 68.

29:16.214 --> 29:18.114
Now, the first owner of the house

29:18.216 --> 29:21.017
was this guy named Valentine Carpozi.

29:21.119 --> 29:25.221
Well, in 1978, Valentine,
at the age of 66,

29:25.323 --> 29:28.491
has a massive heart attack
in the living room here.

29:28.593 --> 29:30.312
And was declared dead an hour later.

29:30.412 --> 29:31.844
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

29:31.946 --> 29:35.348
Now, I do have his
death certificate here.

29:35.450 --> 29:37.350
He officially died at the hospital,

29:37.452 --> 29:39.185
but in my experience, when somebody

29:39.287 --> 29:40.553
has a massive heart attack,

29:40.655 --> 29:42.588
- they're usually dead right away.
- Right.

29:42.691 --> 29:45.658
Now I did manage to
track down a photo of him

29:45.760 --> 29:48.561
with his second wife, Eleanor.

29:49.394 --> 29:51.795
What do you think
when you see the photo?

29:51.897 --> 29:54.164
Well, I did have a sketch of him.

29:58.904 --> 30:00.403
I'm pretty sure this is the same guy,

30:00.505 --> 30:01.704
but you guys tell me.

30:01.807 --> 30:03.306
Take a look at the photo
and the sketch together.

30:07.279 --> 30:07.944
Yep.

30:08.046 --> 30:09.045
It resembles the guy that I saw.

30:09.147 --> 30:14.250
That could be the person
that's looking in on me.

30:14.352 --> 30:20.023
So there are two
separate deceased females

30:20.125 --> 30:23.927
that are in the house and are active.

30:24.029 --> 30:26.463
What I got was that
they're both murder victims.

30:26.565 --> 30:28.565
One of the females

30:28.667 --> 30:33.403
is mentally ill and
stuck in her death state,

30:33.505 --> 30:38.708
and she's reliving the pain of
her murder over and over again.

30:38.810 --> 30:39.976
I'm thinking, well,

30:40.078 --> 30:42.745
it may be a stab wound,
gunshot, I'm not sure.

30:42.848 --> 30:45.448
All I know is that she bled out.

30:45.550 --> 30:47.317
The other female is a teenager.

30:47.419 --> 30:50.620
Her body is decomposing,
she has like a bluish-gray,

30:50.722 --> 30:52.956
you know, hue.

30:53.058 --> 30:56.226
And with her, I felt sharp neck pains,

30:56.328 --> 30:59.262
so I'm thinking she might
have been stabbed there.

30:59.364 --> 31:01.030
The thing that I found disturbing

31:01.132 --> 31:04.901
about these two females
was that they can't leave.

31:05.003 --> 31:09.639
And I actually saw leashes
strapped around them.

31:09.741 --> 31:13.877
What I got was that at
some point in this house,

31:13.979 --> 31:16.279
somebody was playing with the occult

31:16.381 --> 31:18.848
or some type of witchcraft.

31:18.950 --> 31:22.752
May have been using Ouija
boards or doing seances,

31:22.854 --> 31:24.954
and they might not be aware,

31:25.056 --> 31:28.157
but they inadvertently
trapped these two females

31:28.260 --> 31:29.726
and made an attachment to them.

31:29.828 --> 31:31.861
Oh, my God.

31:31.963 --> 31:33.763
Now, everybody in the family

31:33.865 --> 31:37.300
that I spoke to said
that they've never messed

31:37.402 --> 31:38.902
with anything like that.

31:39.004 --> 31:43.773
But one of the previous
owners of your home did.

31:43.875 --> 31:46.609
And that's Valentine's
second wife, Eleanor.

31:46.711 --> 31:50.813
After Valentine died, she
lived here for 21 years alone.

31:50.916 --> 31:53.249
Eleanor was, from what
I was told, religious.

31:53.351 --> 31:54.751
So I met with her pastor.

31:54.853 --> 31:56.352
This is where it gets interesting.

31:56.454 --> 31:59.489
The church identifies as
Christian, but also believes

31:59.591 --> 32:01.257
- in the paranormal.
- What?

32:01.359 --> 32:04.661
They try to communicate with
the dead during the services.

32:04.763 --> 32:05.695
Oh, boy.

32:05.797 --> 32:07.130
Could this be the woman

32:07.232 --> 32:09.632
that you think might have been
communicating with the dead?

32:09.734 --> 32:10.633
Yes.

32:10.735 --> 32:13.536
It makes a lot of sense.

32:13.638 --> 32:15.772
So let me ask a question,
what are these two dead women

32:15.874 --> 32:17.073
doing in the house?

32:17.175 --> 32:21.052
They spend most of their
time in the back two bedrooms

32:21.152 --> 32:22.652
to the right.

32:22.754 --> 32:26.155
Okay, so that's William Jr.'s
room and their master bedroom.

32:26.257 --> 32:27.557
Okay.

32:27.659 --> 32:32.228
They do inadvertently
interact with the living a bit.

32:32.330 --> 32:36.666
I would think that you guys
would occasionally see them.

32:36.768 --> 32:38.734
They're rather vocal.

32:38.836 --> 32:43.306
I would think that you
guys would hear voices.

32:43.408 --> 32:46.075
Now, we could talk about the
woman you saw in the basement.

32:46.177 --> 32:47.279
- Mm-hmm.
- Describe it to Amy.

32:47.379 --> 32:50.680
She was a short lady
with long white hair

32:50.782 --> 32:54.484
and a long white gown.

32:54.586 --> 32:55.919
It scared the hell out of me.

32:56.021 --> 32:59.422
Have any of you heard,
like, voices at night?

32:59.524 --> 33:01.958
Their son, William Jr.,
did before he moved out.

33:02.060 --> 33:03.760
He couldn't take all the activity.

33:03.862 --> 33:07.464
Wow.

33:07.566 --> 33:11.634
The younger dead girl
likes to spend a lot of time

33:11.737 --> 33:14.204
in the master bedroom.

33:14.306 --> 33:16.606
I saw her sitting on the floor

33:16.708 --> 33:20.810
and talking to the female in the bed.

33:20.912 --> 33:24.447
The living person may not
know that this is happening

33:24.549 --> 33:28.418
because it would seem like
more like sleep talking.

33:28.520 --> 33:31.521
We didn't share that.

33:31.623 --> 33:36.993
That for the past two years

33:37.095 --> 33:39.996
I've started talking in my sleep.

33:40.098 --> 33:45.969
And William says I have a full
conversation that wakes him up.

33:46.071 --> 33:48.171
I drew a sketch

33:48.273 --> 33:54.577
of what I saw happening
between these two individuals.

33:54.679 --> 33:56.079
Are you guys ready for this?

34:00.652 --> 34:02.727
You're gonna be shocked
when you see this.

34:05.404 --> 34:07.122
God.

34:11.188 --> 34:13.155
That's exactly what I saw.

34:13.257 --> 34:14.322
It's when she turned,

34:14.425 --> 34:16.725
her face was like a
gargoyle or something.

34:16.827 --> 34:19.194
It was exactly what I saw.

34:19.295 --> 34:23.831
And that's your only conscious
interaction that you recall?

34:23.934 --> 34:26.702
Other than my name being called.

34:26.804 --> 34:28.070
Okay, okay.

34:28.172 --> 34:30.906
Like, someone's always
trying to get my attention.

34:31.007 --> 34:32.913
I'm getting the hell out of this house.

34:37.221 --> 34:39.418
The last person I encountered

34:39.518 --> 34:42.485
really concerned me.

34:42.587 --> 34:44.353
The first time I saw him,

34:44.456 --> 34:46.656
it was really weird because

34:46.757 --> 34:50.460
he surrounds himself with light.

34:50.562 --> 34:53.630
I come downstairs about
8:00 in the morning,

34:53.732 --> 34:59.502
and... a body over light...

34:59.604 --> 35:03.840
like, sparkles... tons of
them coming up the steps.

35:03.942 --> 35:06.476
When I come down, it
stopped, and I stopped,

35:06.578 --> 35:08.578
- and we're staring at each other.
- Wow.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.381
But my whole body was just shaking.

35:11.483 --> 35:13.082
So what else does this guy do?

35:13.185 --> 35:15.118
He figures out

35:15.220 --> 35:18.054
what means the most to
the people in the house,

35:18.156 --> 35:19.422
what they love the most,

35:19.524 --> 35:22.192
what they're most passionate about,

35:22.294 --> 35:25.528
and then he tries to
take it away from them.

35:25.630 --> 35:29.098
Now, what's the one thing
that would destroy your life?

35:29.201 --> 35:31.935
Losing my family.

35:32.037 --> 35:34.771
Is that what he's trying to do?

35:34.873 --> 35:40.376
What I saw was that he
would smush himself down

35:40.478 --> 35:42.679
and then raise up from the ground.

35:42.781 --> 35:45.048
When he does that kind of stuff,

35:45.150 --> 35:48.284
the dead women freak out.

35:48.386 --> 35:51.221
And what I saw was
just like pandemonium.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.690
I'm like, I think that
the living here would feel

35:53.792 --> 35:57.560
like this chaos, this movement
of people rushing around.

35:57.662 --> 36:00.129
And that's when he's...

36:00.232 --> 36:03.499
he's in the room doing that.

36:03.602 --> 36:05.835
Tell her your number one
complaint about the footsteps.

36:05.937 --> 36:08.104
We can be in the
basement, and you hear...

36:08.206 --> 36:11.274
That loud.

36:11.376 --> 36:15.745
The first time we heard it, we
thought someone had broke in.

36:15.847 --> 36:18.014
I brought in a pest control
specialist just to check it out,

36:18.116 --> 36:20.149
to be on the safe side.

36:20.252 --> 36:22.748
He didn't find a thing.

36:24.557 --> 36:27.491
So this guy with the lights,
any clue who he was in life?

36:27.593 --> 36:30.127
He was not a good
person when he was alive.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.929
He said that he ruined people,

36:32.031 --> 36:34.765
he was a thief, that he would
take things from people...

36:34.867 --> 36:36.300
like their land or business.

36:36.402 --> 36:40.070
He also caused a lot of people to die.

36:40.172 --> 36:45.042
At one point, the younger girl

36:45.144 --> 36:50.013
pointed at him and said that
he was the one who murdered her.

36:50.115 --> 36:56.019
He believes that the situation
that he's in now is hell.

36:57.890 --> 37:01.475
He wants out, but he feels
like he's damned himself.

37:02.831 --> 37:04.409
I came across somebody in my research

37:04.511 --> 37:06.745
that may fit the bill about
who she's talking about.

37:06.847 --> 37:08.613
A notorious gangster, actually,

37:08.715 --> 37:12.217
that terrorized this area in 1932.

37:12.319 --> 37:14.486
His name was Athay Brown.

37:14.588 --> 37:18.256
I've actually got a photo of him.

37:18.358 --> 37:19.524
He worked with his wife, Rose,

37:19.626 --> 37:23.328
and a couple other gang
members in the area here.

37:23.430 --> 37:26.831
Now, in a six-month span,
they committed 40 robberies

37:26.934 --> 37:28.934
and murdered four
people that we know of.

37:29.036 --> 37:30.302
What?!

37:30.404 --> 37:33.138
Now, Brown and his crew,

37:33.240 --> 37:37.309
back on August 30, 1932,

37:37.411 --> 37:39.278
hit a home about 100
yards from this house.

37:39.504 --> 37:42.371
The woman who lived there,
Kerri Sykes, was a psychic.

37:42.473 --> 37:45.508
She had an elderly friend over.

37:45.610 --> 37:46.976
When she opened the door,

37:47.078 --> 37:49.578
they pulled out their guns,
brought them into the basement,

37:49.681 --> 37:50.713
tied them up.

37:50.815 --> 37:53.082
While the guys were
ransacking the house,

37:53.184 --> 37:56.118
Kerri wound up dying of a
heart attack in the basement.

37:56.220 --> 37:58.521
Five weeks later,

37:58.623 --> 38:03.859
he broke into a gang member's
house to kill him for snitching.

38:03.962 --> 38:06.862
Instead, he accidentally shot and killed

38:06.965 --> 38:09.632
the guy's 20-year-old
pregnant wife.

38:09.734 --> 38:12.468
Her name was Francis Holt.

38:12.570 --> 38:15.738
And I got her death certificate as well.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.840
He was convicted of
first-degree murder.

38:17.942 --> 38:19.499
On March 10, 1933,

38:19.599 --> 38:22.600
Athay was electrocuted at
the Ohio State Penitentiary.

38:22.702 --> 38:25.636
Now, he was only 27 years old.

38:25.739 --> 38:29.574
I don't think we'll know for sure

38:29.676 --> 38:32.210
if it's this man, but it's possible.

38:32.312 --> 38:36.013
All right, so, we don't
know who the guy is,

38:36.116 --> 38:40.218
but what does he want with
our beautiful family here?

38:40.320 --> 38:45.189
His thing is is that he
wants to hurt people here.

38:45.291 --> 38:49.961
His purpose being that
he needs to destroy.

38:50.063 --> 38:52.063
I'm terrified.

38:52.165 --> 38:54.699
How much more that we can take of this?

38:54.801 --> 38:56.200
It's destroying my family.

38:56.302 --> 38:59.370
Things are just out of whack here.

39:13.068 --> 39:14.367
Annette, when we first met,

39:14.469 --> 39:17.529
you told me your motto is don't
mess with my family or my home.

39:17.629 --> 39:18.594
Yes.

39:18.696 --> 39:20.963
Now we know what's
been messing with both.

39:21.065 --> 39:24.801
The question is can you
kick out the rat [bleep]

39:24.903 --> 39:26.836
That's responsible for
trying to destroy your family

39:26.938 --> 39:29.739
and get your life back the
way you guys want it to be?

39:29.841 --> 39:34.277
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:34.379 --> 39:37.780
You could move.

39:37.882 --> 39:41.584
That would be really
the easiest thing to do.

39:41.686 --> 39:44.720
But there would still be all this mess

39:44.823 --> 39:47.924
here for the next people.

39:48.026 --> 39:50.092
But if you're really determined to stay,

39:50.195 --> 39:55.665
what needs to be done would be
to reach out to the pastor...

39:55.767 --> 39:56.833
Mm-hmm.

39:56.935 --> 39:58.568
Of this church

39:58.670 --> 40:02.338
and have him create a team

40:02.440 --> 40:05.174
of his best sensitives.

40:05.276 --> 40:10.146
And, basically, they would
have it out with Eleanor.

40:10.248 --> 40:12.148
Fight fire with fire.

40:12.250 --> 40:14.584
Once she's removed,

40:14.686 --> 40:19.088
the two dead women
will be able to move on.

40:19.190 --> 40:24.026
But her husband would
need more assistance

40:24.128 --> 40:30.132
because he's so confused
by what's going on.

40:30.235 --> 40:31.767
Once that's been done,

40:31.870 --> 40:36.305
then the killer, obviously,
needs to be addressed.

40:36.407 --> 40:39.442
And what would happen there would be

40:39.544 --> 40:43.980
the sensitives would actually
summon him and let him know

40:44.082 --> 40:46.515
that he's able to leave.

40:46.618 --> 40:50.019
The only good thing about
him is that he actually

40:50.121 --> 40:51.854
does want to go,

40:51.956 --> 40:56.200
but he's made himself believe he can't.

40:56.962 --> 40:58.828
William, what are you thinking?

40:59.430 --> 41:02.531
Move.

41:02.634 --> 41:05.568
Even if we did get rid
of stuff like that, man,

41:05.670 --> 41:07.703
it's just too much still.

41:07.805 --> 41:10.206
You know, you'd still be like,

41:10.308 --> 41:12.008
"Is it still here?"

41:12.110 --> 41:13.376
In the back of our
minds, it would be like...

41:13.478 --> 41:15.444
- You're traumatized.
- Yeah.

41:16.857 --> 41:19.763
Well, Annette, we know
how William and Nikki feel.

41:19.863 --> 41:21.563
You still want to fight, though?

41:21.665 --> 41:24.967
This is my home. I've
been here almost 15 years.

41:25.069 --> 41:27.903
I've poured my heart and soul into this.

41:29.163 --> 41:31.296
This is the heart of the matter.

41:32.181 --> 41:34.714
But in order to get my family back,

41:34.816 --> 41:36.683
I'm willing to do anything.

41:37.114 --> 41:39.080
I wish I had better news
for Annette and her family.

41:39.182 --> 41:42.174
But leaving this house
is their best option.

41:42.274 --> 41:44.741
If they're not able to move right away,

41:44.843 --> 41:46.342
their only hope is to contact the pastor

41:46.367 --> 41:49.733
to free themselves of the dead trapped inside their home.
