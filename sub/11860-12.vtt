00:12.667 --> 00:14.417
Mrs. Welter, sorry
to keep you
waiting.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.250
Mr. Denton..

00:16.333 --> 00:18.875
I'd like the results
of your investigation.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.333
What's that you have on,
Mrs. Welter?

00:21.417 --> 00:23.667
It's intoxicating.

00:23.750 --> 00:24.875
Moonlit Mist.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.458
You're stalling, Mr. Denton.

00:28.542 --> 00:30.625
I don't like it
when men keep me waiting.

00:30.709 --> 00:32.667
Then let's get down to business.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.125
The good news, Mrs. Welter

00:34.208 --> 00:37.583
is that your
husband,
Carl is rich.

00:37.667 --> 00:42.625
The bad news is he's banging
his secretary...Myrtle
Bartlett.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.291
(Harry)
'Hot little number.
Wednesdays and Thursdays.'

00:45.375 --> 00:48.000
'Room at the Capricorn Motel,
lunch at the Regent.'

00:48.083 --> 00:49.333
Then took her shopping.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.125
Bought her several
undergarments at Macy's

00:51.208 --> 00:54.792
and a bottle of
perfume
...Moonlit Mist.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.834
Oh. Here, let me see.

00:59.917 --> 01:02.291
Upside down.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.625
Reminds me of a Chinese circus
I saw once.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.500
I'm glad you find
this funny, Mr. Denton.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.291
Flexible son of a bitch
though,
ain't he?

01:26.583 --> 01:29.000
Oh, Lana, sweetheart, come here
and let me see your shoes.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.500
You've seen them already. Twice.

01:31.583 --> 01:32.917
Hey-hey, that's my medicine.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.333
Wilson Katz is here.
I told him you needed a
minute.

01:35.417 --> 01:36.959
(Harry)
'For what?'

01:37.041 --> 01:39.458
We can't have you looking
like you've been in a bar
fight.

01:39.542 --> 01:41.792
Don't suppose Mrs. Welter
paid her bill?

01:41.875 --> 01:43.000
No.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.333
I'm sick of taking
these penny-ante cases.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.333
Maybe Katz has got a big job.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.583
Probably just scraps, but..

01:49.667 --> 01:52.166
Alright, go ahead.
Let the bald bastard in.

02:35.667 --> 02:36.750
What do you got?

02:36.834 --> 02:38.709
Workers uncovered
the bones this morning.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.709
Male. CSU estimate late '40s.

02:41.792 --> 02:43.583
(Lilly)
'Site engineer thinks
the body was there'

02:43.667 --> 02:45.041
when the foundation was poured.

02:45.125 --> 02:48.208
Contacted LNI to get a date on
the original build permit.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.542
Unlucky worker or a union scab.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.417
Well, carrying a gun,
not a hammer.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.917
(Scotty)
'Techs recovered
it with the body. It's a
.32.'

02:56.000 --> 02:57.750
- Murder weapon?
- Not likely.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.917
Found in a holster on the body.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.917
They got a hit
on the serial numbers.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.208
It's registered
to a Harold Denton.

03:05.291 --> 03:06.458
Harry Denton.

03:06.542 --> 03:08.125
- Ring a bell?
- Ex-vice cop.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.583
Took a swing at his captain.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.417
- One of us?
- No, they washed him out.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.041
And Harry went over
to the dark side

03:13.125 --> 03:14.875
and became
a private investigator.

03:14.959 --> 03:17.125
Man, it's bunch of scumbags.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.542
Creeping around the bushes

03:18.625 --> 03:21.083
snapping shots
of cheating husbands and wives.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.417
Umm, they're not all
bad,
I had one do me a solid

03:23.500 --> 03:24.917
on a rape case
a couple years
back.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.417
These guys are all the same.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.667
They're thinking they're
solving
mysteries like Sam Spade.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.333
That Harry's game?

03:31.417 --> 03:33.542
I got a buddy in Vice
who will remember him.

03:33.625 --> 03:36.208
Probably just
taking
cases to get by.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.834
Looks like Harry
took the wrong case.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.375
(Lilly)
Harry Denton, 40 years old.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.834
M.E. says the dental records
are a match.

04:20.917 --> 04:25.083
Well, missing persons
report filed May 11,
1974

04:25.166 --> 04:27.500
by Harry's secretary,
Lana Parker.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.959
Reported the safe in Harry's
office had been cleaned out.

04:30.041 --> 04:31.542
A list of Harry's
last
appointments.

04:31.625 --> 04:32.834
So that's about it.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.709
Assigned really punched
the clock on this one.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.750
Harry burned some bridges
around here.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.458
- You talk to IAB?
- Odd.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.375
There's no mention of Harry
hitting his captain.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.375
Got drummed out
for taking the note.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.959
- Harry was dirty?
- Yeah

04:44.041 --> 04:45.500
Booted off the force in '71.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.917
Started up Denton
Investigations
right after.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.417
Different times back then.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.458
The way I heard it, a
lot
of cops on the take.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.208
Didn't stop with Dacron
and disco.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.208
Recovered a .38 caliber bullet

04:57.291 --> 04:58.959
embedded in the breast bone

04:59.041 --> 05:00.959
suggesting a
posterior
point of entry.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.417
Shot in the back.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.291
(Scotty)
'Probably running
from something.'

05:04.375 --> 05:05.834
What do you got, Nick?

05:05.917 --> 05:09.125
Well...spent a riveting hour

05:09.208 --> 05:12.333
down at the licensing
and inspection office.

05:12.417 --> 05:16.125
HBT Construction did the cement
work May 8th.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.375
How about a list
of company employees?

05:18.458 --> 05:21.041
Besides the name,
I got a bunch of nothing.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.709
The outfit went belly up
in the '80s.

05:32.583 --> 05:33.834
Got a minute?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.750
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Pops.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.208
You should have called
before you came down.

05:38.291 --> 05:39.458
You find something out?

05:39.542 --> 05:42.333
What...Did ma say something?

05:42.417 --> 05:43.667
Don't have to.

05:43.750 --> 05:44.959
I know when something is up.

05:45.041 --> 05:47.750
Hey, look, Pops, it's not
a good time right now.

05:47.834 --> 05:49.125
We'll talk later.

05:49.208 --> 05:52.750
- I'll come back.
- We'll grab lunch tomorrow.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.125
I promise.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.417
Harry finally turned up.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.959
Yeah, under a three
story
office building

06:07.041 --> 06:08.542
and seven tons of concrete.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.125
Shot in the back.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.417
Kept his desk.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.125
Even left his medicine.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.917
Harry was one of the good ones.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.709
You filed
the missing person's report?

06:16.792 --> 06:18.291
A lot of good that did.

06:18.375 --> 06:21.125
<i>persona non grata</i>
with the Philly P.D.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.125
On account of him
getting kicked off the
force?

06:23.208 --> 06:26.000
Kept telling me without a body
or evidence of foul play

06:26.083 --> 06:28.291
they were going under the
assumption he'd skipped town.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.500
Not like Harry?

06:29.583 --> 06:31.583
Harry wasn't the
type
to turn tail.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.792
Trust me, there were
times
I wish he had.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.417
You took over Harry's business
after he disappeared?

06:36.500 --> 06:39.542
That's right, I knocked
off
Harry so I could get
rich

06:39.625 --> 06:42.000
taking photos
of cheating
spouses.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.959
I've seen people kill for less.

06:44.041 --> 06:45.959
Harry could be a real pain
in the ass

06:46.041 --> 06:47.959
but his heart was
in the right place.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.542
What sort of casework
did Harry specialize in?

06:50.625 --> 06:53.500
If it had a pulse and a
wallet
and walked through that
door

06:53.583 --> 06:54.959
we took the job.

06:55.041 --> 06:58.041
This is a list of the
cases
Harry was working on.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.291
Anything we should know about?

07:00.375 --> 07:03.667
[sighs]
Krebs was a tail job,
went nowhere.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.667
O'Keefe, a cheating husband.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.041
Same as Barb Welter.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.792
What about the one
that says
"counselor"?

07:08.875 --> 07:11.041
Wilson Katz.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.333
Big shot lawyer.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.875
He and Harry served
in the navy
together.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.166
Harry ever work for him before?

07:16.250 --> 07:17.500
A little bit of this,
a little bit of that

07:17.583 --> 07:19.250
but always on the QT.

07:22.834 --> 07:24.625
I see business
is going well, Harry.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.000
It's nothing.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.667
Oh, silk.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.583
Oh, you must be keeping
some swanky company

07:30.667 --> 07:31.834
these days, Wilson.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.834
I remember when you was
wearing plastic shoes

07:33.917 --> 07:34.834
and eating at the Automat.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.166
Alright, knock it off, Harry.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.709
I'm here about a client.

07:37.792 --> 07:38.875
You know my rates.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.500
This client requires discretion.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.208
To ensure that discretion
the client is willing

07:42.291 --> 07:43.709
to double your rates.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.542
Alright, enough
with the cryptic jive,
Katz.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.291
Just tell me the job.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.166
Lana, be a sweetheart

07:52.250 --> 07:54.166
go out and grab us
a couple coffees, would you?

07:58.542 --> 08:00.542
When I came back,
they were gone.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.000
Ever find out what the case was?

08:02.083 --> 08:04.041
I asked, but Harry
wouldn't tell me.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.417
Is Katz still around?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.667
He's still practicing.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.667
Making problems disappear.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.041
- For a fee, of course.
- Not a fan?

08:11.125 --> 08:14.250
Know the difference
between
a mosquito and a lawyer?

08:14.333 --> 08:16.458
(Nick)
'One's a blood sucking
parasite'

08:16.542 --> 08:18.000
the other's an insect.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.458
(Scotty)
'The season opener's
a ways off, Mr. Katz.'

08:24.542 --> 08:27.125
[chuckles]
That it is, Detective.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.041
How can I help you?

08:32.125 --> 08:34.917
We're here about
your old friend, Harry
Denton.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.417
(Scotty)
'They found his body'

08:36.500 --> 08:38.917
buried under an office
building
in Center City.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.917
I'm not surprised.
Harry kept bad company.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.625
- Lawyers included?
- Hmm. I'm afraid so.

08:44.709 --> 08:47.417
(Scotty)
You hired Harry
right before he was
killed.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.625
- Perhaps.
- What was the job?

08:50.709 --> 08:52.792
I have my client's privacy
to protect.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.583
(Scotty)
'I bet those fancy clients
of yours'

08:54.667 --> 08:57.375
would love opening
their morning paper

08:57.458 --> 09:00.375
seeing your name linked
to a murder investigation.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.792
I retained Harry's services
at the behest of a client.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.875
- Name?
- Caroline Hargreave.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.625
Huh.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.625
Some lunk of goldfish, huh?

09:25.709 --> 09:29.125
Koi, flown in direct from Kyoto.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.458
Don't touch them.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.667
Be a darling,
Wilson,
and fetch my robe.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.458
Hell of a view.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.750
Harry Denton,
Denton
Investigations.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.208
Wilson says you're good
at finding things.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.000
Depends on what I'm looking for.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.500
Harry's the right man
for the job.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.166
I need you to find
my daughter, Mr. Denton.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.750
(Caroline)
'Her name's Michelle,
but we call her Bunny.'

09:59.834 --> 10:01.000
Pretty girl.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.417
Beauty can be a burden.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.291
- Runaway?
- Last week.

10:04.375 --> 10:07.000
- It happen before?
- No.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.333
Helps if I know why
she decided to scram.

10:10.417 --> 10:13.250
Bunny's father, Stan,
recently passed away.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.625
Heart attack.

10:14.709 --> 10:16.166
Quite a shock.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.458
And Bunny took it hard?

10:17.542 --> 10:19.542
Adored her father.
She started acting out.

10:19.625 --> 10:22.250
I'd rather not involve
the police again.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.667
Again?

10:23.750 --> 10:25.792
Last month they picked her
up
for reckless driving.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.667
Wilson says
you're the discrete
type.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.542
You betcha.
Anything else I should know?

10:30.625 --> 10:33.375
To make a long story short, I
plan on sending her to Oakdale

10:33.458 --> 10:34.959
camp for troubled teens.

10:35.041 --> 10:36.458
And Bunny resisted.

10:36.542 --> 10:39.041
We had a terrible fight.
She took her car and ran
away.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.875
I'm worried she's in trouble.

10:40.959 --> 10:42.583
What sort of trouble?

10:42.667 --> 10:45.542
I'm afraid she fell in
with some undesirables.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.875
Bohemians and radicals.

10:47.959 --> 10:50.291
Oh, well, you got to watch out
for those types.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.959
Did a number on Patty Hearst.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.041
That's where you come
in,
Mr. Denton.

10:54.125 --> 10:57.083
I want my daughter back safe
and with a minimum of fuss.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.166
I'll start today.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.000
Wilson, see to it that
Mr. Denton gets his
money.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.667
But Harry was too late.

11:11.750 --> 11:12.959
He didn't find her?

11:13.041 --> 11:15.959
Bunny died in a car accident
several days later.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.458
When was this?

11:17.542 --> 11:21.083
May 6, 1974.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.875
Caroline was heartbroken.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.959
Blamed herself
for not acting sooner.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.041
This is Rush from Homicide.

11:52.125 --> 11:54.583
Got a possible 10-37.

11:54.667 --> 11:58.792
'A DUI suspect driving
a dark gray Chevy Cobalt'

11:58.875 --> 12:00.709
'license number 9..'

12:04.250 --> 12:09.041
Tracked down the owner of
HBT Construction, Carl Welter.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.792
HBT was one of a series
of shell companies

12:11.875 --> 12:14.500
set up to take advantage
of non-union contracts.

12:14.583 --> 12:15.959
And what's the connect to Harry?

12:16.041 --> 12:19.291
Welter's wife Barb hired Harry
to check up him.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.667
Harry captured
a few Kodak moments

12:21.750 --> 12:24.166
between Carl and his secretary.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.458
Booked for agg assault in '75.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.792
Settled a dispute
with one of his
subcontractors

12:28.875 --> 12:30.542
with a piece of rebar.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.041
And Harry gets
a concrete coffin.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.000
HBT Construction.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.166
One of your company's
poured the foundation, Carl.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.208
I-I'd have to have a
date
and an address

12:47.291 --> 12:49.333
and even then,
I can't promise you
nothing.

12:49.417 --> 12:53.750
May 8, 1974, 16 North Terrace.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.166
Could have been one of ours.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.333
I'm guessing disposing of
bodies
is a big code violation.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.667
Oh-ho-ho, I don't
know
nothing about that.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.041
Could have been some illegal
that fell asleep on a job

13:03.125 --> 13:04.417
it wouldn't be the first time.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.000
Man's name was Harry Denton,
private eye.

13:07.083 --> 13:10.583
Did a little work
for your wife,
Barb.

13:10.667 --> 13:11.917
Okay..

13:12.000 --> 13:14.542
...so I wanted
to wring his neck, wouldn't
you?

13:37.208 --> 13:39.375
You seen her?

13:39.458 --> 13:42.542
How about you?
Seen her? You?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.417
- In there.
- In here?

14:05.125 --> 14:07.458
Stop!
Get your hands off me!

14:07.542 --> 14:09.083
Just doing my job, kid.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.417
That woman is not my mother

14:10.500 --> 14:11.667
Just get in-get in the--

14:11.750 --> 14:13.625
Get your hands off me!

14:13.709 --> 14:15.875
Stop!

14:15.959 --> 14:17.250
Get in!

14:17.333 --> 14:19.166
You can't do this!

14:19.250 --> 14:20.959
You son of a bitch!

14:22.834 --> 14:24.834
- What is with you people?
- Say the word, Harry.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.291
Easy, easy, Frenchie.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.959
Branching out to kidnapping
underage girls, Denton?

14:30.041 --> 14:31.750
Stray glee-clubber.
What's on your mind,
Carl?

14:31.834 --> 14:34.083
The photos you took
are gonna cost me a bundle.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.709
Well, maybe we can work
something out

14:35.792 --> 14:38.750
seeing as how your
wife
neglected to pay her
bill.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.792
- What'd you have in mind?
- I see the number 500.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.458
and those negatives
of you and the steno

14:43.542 --> 14:46.041
doing the motel mambo
disappear.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.542
How do I know I can trust you?

14:47.625 --> 14:49.500
Oh, you
don't.
My advice.

14:49.583 --> 14:52.583
Patch things up with the
missus.
It's cheaper in the long run.

14:52.667 --> 14:56.792
Yeah, I'm starting to see that.

14:56.875 --> 14:57.959
- $400
- Six!

14:58.041 --> 14:59.959
Alright, all right, five, $500.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.667
Frenchie, release Mr. Welter.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.000
Bunny's keys ought
to be in that bag.

15:07.041 --> 15:08.583
Take her to Mexico.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.041
A couple of margaritas,
a little nude snorkeling

15:11.125 --> 15:13.583
a tennis bracelet,
she'll forgive you.

15:18.875 --> 15:22.625
[sighs]
The son of a bitch
was right about Mexico.

15:22.709 --> 15:24.166
'Course, she ran off
with a shoe salesman

15:24.250 --> 15:26.166
a couple of years later.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.667
Describe the girl
you saw Harry
with.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.792
Blonde, she was real pretty.

15:29.875 --> 15:33.083
She wasn't too happy
about being put in that
trunk.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.834
Yeah, that looks like her.

15:34.917 --> 15:36.417
Could have done something
about it.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.959
And have Harry's pet
gorilla
twist my head off?

15:40.041 --> 15:41.250
Remember when this was?

15:41.333 --> 15:42.709
Let's see, The wife and I left

15:42.792 --> 15:45.917
for Puerto Vallarta the very
next day for Cinco de Mayo

15:46.000 --> 15:48.750
so it was May 4th.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.250
Looks like someone
had a little Irish
breakfast.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.625
It's not mine.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.917
I hear Moe Kitchener got
picked up for DUI last night.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.458
Imagine that.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.166
Spoke to my buddy in Vice.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.709
He said Harry's whole
unit was on the take.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.041
Captain hung 'em out to dry

16:14.125 --> 16:15.750
when they opened up
a corruption probe.

16:15.834 --> 16:18.709
The captain was probably taking
more money than all of' em.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.834
Probably why Harry clocked him.

16:20.917 --> 16:23.041
I pulled the
accident
report on Bunny.

16:24.792 --> 16:27.583
"Lost control of the car
around a curve.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.458
Hit a tree
and burst into flames."

16:29.542 --> 16:31.625
Now problem is,
Welter says he saw
Harry

16:31.709 --> 16:33.834
with Bunny two days
before the accident.

16:33.917 --> 16:36.000
- With this French character.
- Some pet gorilla.

16:36.083 --> 16:38.834
Katz says they never
contacted him,
though.

16:38.917 --> 16:41.250
So, Lana thinks Harry helped

16:41.333 --> 16:43.542
French dodge
a manslaughter
charge.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.166
Ran the name
alias.
Came up vapors.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.875
Well, I figure Harry and
French
were scheming

16:47.959 --> 16:50.000
to shake down
Caroline Hargreave.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.917
It's a pity
they don't last longer.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.667
- Spoke to your lawyer.
- He told me.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.125
This whole thing brings
up
terrible memories.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.625
About your stepdaughter, Bunny?

17:11.709 --> 17:15.333
Yes. We got along just
fine
until Stan died.

17:15.417 --> 17:16.750
(Lilly)
'That when she took off?'

17:16.834 --> 17:18.333
(Caroline)
'She was a very emotional
girl.'

17:18.417 --> 17:21.417
Had a history of it on
her
mother's side of the
family.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.166
Tried everything I
could
to help her.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.458
Including hiring
a private investigator.

17:25.542 --> 17:28.417
Oh, Mr. Denton,
he was my lawyer's
idea.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.125
I never trusted that man.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.625
And he tried to shake you down?

17:31.709 --> 17:33.959
The night before the accident,
he came over here

17:34.041 --> 17:38.417
and gave me some cock and bull
story about needing more money.

17:45.792 --> 17:46.917
Looks painful.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.208
Makes them easier
to handle. See?

17:50.291 --> 17:52.125
That's a dragon's eye.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.750
This one here's
an American beauty.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.291
How about that?

17:56.375 --> 17:58.542
Wilson said you had news
to report.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.959
Have you located Bunny?

18:01.041 --> 18:02.375
Not exactly.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.542
The investigation's
hit
a couple of snags.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.250
You need more money,
Mr. Denton?

18:09.333 --> 18:10.792
Well, there is
a direct
correlation

18:10.875 --> 18:12.083
between results and money

18:12.166 --> 18:14.834
especially with
these
recovery jobs.

18:14.917 --> 18:16.000
Very well.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.166
I'll have Wilson
advance you more funds.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.750
What do you call this?

18:24.500 --> 18:26.834
- It's primrose.
- Ah, primrose.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.333
I can't have Bunny running wild

18:30.417 --> 18:33.583
exposing herself to God knows
what sort of dangers.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.500
I expect results, Mr. Denton.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.250
Oh, I'm onto something, alright.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.250
I knew right then
he was up to
something.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.959
That he was after money,
or gardening tips?

18:58.041 --> 18:59.750
I knew he had Bunny.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.291
You should have gone
to the police.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.458
Yeah, a lot of
things
I should have
done.

19:03.542 --> 19:07.542
Instead, I hired his
assistant,
had her check up on him.

19:07.625 --> 19:08.917
Lana?

19:09.000 --> 19:12.500
Yes, she agreed to help
me
for a price, of course.

19:12.583 --> 19:16.166
But the next night I got
the call about the
accident.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.583
I blame myself.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.500
[mourning]
I should have just let her
go.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.834
Left a few things out, Lana.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.792
Caroline Hargreave hired you
to check on Harry.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.417
She wanted her daughter back.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.250
So, you double-crossed Harry?

19:37.333 --> 19:39.625
She called me and asked me
to check on him.

19:39.709 --> 19:42.041
She no longer trusted Harry.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.583
What about you?

19:43.667 --> 19:46.250
I figured Harry and French
were cooking up some scheme.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.000
I figured she'd send somebody,
but I didn't think it'd be you.

20:13.083 --> 20:14.667
Well, what do you think, Harry?

20:14.750 --> 20:17.125
She wants her daughter back.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.917
I bet she does.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.792
- Tell her I'm off the case.
- What's going on?

20:21.875 --> 20:24.625
How much she paying you?

20:24.709 --> 20:27.291
Enough to open my own agency.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.709
It's always the pretty
ones
you don't see coming.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.625
French! Stop her!

20:33.709 --> 20:36.041
Come on. She's gonna get away!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.083
Hurry, get in!

20:54.250 --> 20:56.458
(Lana)
'Oh, my God, stop the car,
Harry!'

21:09.834 --> 21:11.208
Bunny.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.458
Harry told me
to get the hell out of
there

21:18.542 --> 21:20.458
and keep my mouth shut.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.083
He was still looking out for you

21:22.166 --> 21:24.166
even though you betrayed him.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.083
I still think about
him
all the time.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.500
That the last time
you saw Harry?

21:29.583 --> 21:32.375
Came back to the office to
apologize, and French was
there.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.875
Cleaning out the safe?

21:33.959 --> 21:37.417
Put a gun in my face and told
me
to keep my mouth shut.

21:48.750 --> 21:49.917
What the hell?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.667
Can't you see
I'm taking a table
nap?

21:51.750 --> 21:53.667
Been a lot of those lately.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.583
- What do you got?
- Some other case.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.250
Don't worry about it.

22:01.041 --> 22:05.041
Um, French's real name
is Chuck Jaworski.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.667
Did a stint in Graterford
for extortion

22:07.750 --> 22:09.125
resisting arrest, assault.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.166
[yawns]
Old school
bad-ass.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.667
Harry helped him dodge
a manslaughter charge.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.417
Did some pro bono snooping
for French's defense lawyer.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.750
Good guy to have in your debt.

22:18.834 --> 22:20.709
You check on that address
in Tinicum Lana gave us?

22:20.792 --> 22:24.083
Yeah, a lot of mice and
daddy longlegs, but no
French.

22:24.166 --> 22:25.834
Put word out to the
local watering holes

22:25.917 --> 22:27.125
a neighbor said he frequents.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.458
Got his info out to patrol.

22:28.542 --> 22:30.959
He turns up, I'm on it.

22:31.041 --> 22:32.542
Now, if you don't mind.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.458
Detective Rush.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.083
See you found some good company.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.834
DUI checkpoint popped up

22:51.917 --> 22:54.250
right outside my favorite
watering hole, imagine that.

22:54.333 --> 22:57.792
A good thing, getting folks
like you off the street.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.291
I'll make bail.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.333
(Lilly)
'Thought you already
got out on bail.'

23:01.417 --> 23:03.417
Sure a Philly judge
will think twice.

23:05.875 --> 23:07.291
This is harassment.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.959
Place you're gonna end up once
your lawyers run out of motions

23:10.041 --> 23:13.709
to file is a whole lot worse
than this.

23:13.792 --> 23:17.625
The least I can do is get you
out of the tank and into a
cell.

23:17.709 --> 23:19.458
Comes with a cell mate, though.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.458
Not a bad guy.

23:23.542 --> 23:25.375
As long as he's on his meds.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.750
See that Mr. Kitchener
and Tiko get acquainted.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.166
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.333
- What have been up to?
- Not hungry.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.458
She told you, huh?

23:48.542 --> 23:51.417
You could've
told me earlier, you know.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.458
Well, she asked me not to.

23:54.542 --> 23:56.333
- That's it, then.
- What?

23:56.417 --> 23:59.166
It's over. We want
this all behind us.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.625
So, drop it.

24:01.709 --> 24:03.166
Drop it?

24:03.250 --> 24:06.500
Pop, Ma was robbed,
and knocked to the
ground--

24:06.583 --> 24:08.083
This is what your mother wants.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.083
Yeah, but, well,
I want to make
sure

24:10.166 --> 24:11.417
this guy doesn't do it again.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.041
<i>Olvidate.</i>

24:13.125 --> 24:14.542
We canceled the cards
and the money doesn't matt--

24:14.625 --> 24:16.750
I know. Pop, you asked
me
to look into this.

24:16.834 --> 24:19.458
I'm gonna find him.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.625
[sighs]
You do what you have to do.

24:21.709 --> 24:25.125
As far as your mother's
concerned, it's over.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.917
<i>Podemos comer ahora</i>

24:28.583 --> 24:30.291
Yeah.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.458
Don't you come in pairs?

24:52.542 --> 24:54.750
Not today.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.125
What are you, buying next round?

24:58.208 --> 24:59.875
Maybe after you come down
to the station

24:59.959 --> 25:03.750
and answer a few questions
about Harry Denton.

25:03.834 --> 25:06.083
Like hell I am.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.208
Sure you want
to push this, Gramps?

25:11.542 --> 25:13.750
Not the first cop
I mopped the floor
with.

25:13.834 --> 25:15.583
Go ahead. Take your best shot.

25:15.667 --> 25:19.041
I'll live, but you'll be
picking
your dentures

25:19.125 --> 25:21.667
off the floor when I'm finished.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.750
That some kind of Asian move?

25:28.834 --> 25:32.417
Now, we can do this
all over downtown..

25:32.500 --> 25:34.583
...or we can just
call it a mulligan.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.917
Ah, hell. Mulligan.

25:41.667 --> 25:45.875
So, what were you and Denton
doing with Bunny Hargreave?

25:45.959 --> 25:48.166
I promised Harry
I'd keep my trap
shut.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.709
Harry's dead.

25:49.792 --> 25:51.542
Somebody shot him.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.125
Well, at least
he's got an
excuse

25:53.208 --> 25:55.000
how come he don't
call me up no
more.

25:55.083 --> 25:57.750
Lana said she caught you
trying to break into his safe.

25:57.834 --> 25:59.458
Yeah, okay, I might have
done something like that

25:59.542 --> 26:01.000
but I didn't kill Harry.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.458
I owe that guy my life.

26:02.542 --> 26:04.875
So what were you guys
trying to do?

26:04.959 --> 26:07.917
- Shake down Caroline Hargreave?
- The rich broad?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.125
He had her daughter stashed
in your safe house.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.875
Nah. Harry was trying
to protect that girl.

26:12.959 --> 26:14.792
- From what?
- Beats me.

26:14.875 --> 26:18.750
I mean, I don't understand the
ins and outs or what have you.

26:18.834 --> 26:21.917
I just did what
Harry told me to
do.

26:30.417 --> 26:31.792
You followed?

26:31.875 --> 26:34.291
Went through precautions,
alright? Did like you said.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.667
- You have any problems?
- Just Lana.

26:36.750 --> 26:37.917
She suspect anything?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.834
Nope. If she did,
I scared her good.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.125
Alright, look, here.

26:43.208 --> 26:45.667
I need you to make sure
that your buddy at the morgue

26:45.750 --> 26:48.166
keeps his trap shut
about that loaner.

26:50.625 --> 26:52.959
Something wrong?

26:53.041 --> 26:54.583
What kind of job is this?

26:56.542 --> 26:58.750
The kind that could get
us both locked up.

27:00.542 --> 27:04.000
I'm trying real hard to do
the right thing here, French.

27:04.083 --> 27:06.166
- You're getting soft,
Harry.
- Shut up.

27:08.625 --> 27:09.792
Alright.

27:09.875 --> 27:11.500
I need you to go
see Frank Bandini

27:11.583 --> 27:13.000
tell him we need a full kit

27:13.083 --> 27:15.625
ID, passport, birth
certificate,
the whole deal.

27:16.875 --> 27:18.250
We're gonna need a name.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.750
We need a name.

27:26.834 --> 27:28.291
For what?

27:28.375 --> 27:29.959
Your new life.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.208
Clara.

27:34.291 --> 27:36.125
Clara Dunaway.

27:43.291 --> 27:47.083
Only me, you and dead Harry
know she's alive.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.834
Whose body was in the wreck?

27:48.917 --> 27:51.125
That's some Jane Doe
I borrowed from the
morgue.

27:51.208 --> 27:53.917
Why'd Harry flip the script?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.250
Asked him the same.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.208
Said he was trying
to make things
right.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.917
So, where's Bunny now?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.583
Where else nobody
gonna look for
you?

28:03.667 --> 28:06.250
Pine Barrens, New Jersey.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.458
Bunny Hargreave?

28:19.250 --> 28:22.208
Haven't heard that name
in 35 years.

28:27.709 --> 28:30.458
- How did you find me?
- Spoke to French.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.000
Now, did you know
Harry was dead?

28:33.083 --> 28:34.083
I knew something bad
had happened

28:34.166 --> 28:36.041
when he didn't come back.

28:36.125 --> 28:38.542
Hoping you can
fill us in on that.

28:39.542 --> 28:41.834
Why didn't Harry
take you back home?

28:42.875 --> 28:44.458
Take it you met my stepmother.

28:44.542 --> 28:46.959
She thought you died
in that wreck.

28:47.041 --> 28:48.959
Sure she put on
quite a show for
you.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.500
She hired Harry to find you.

28:50.583 --> 28:53.125
Yeah, so she could
ship me off to
Oakdale.

28:53.208 --> 28:55.125
Place wasn't a summer camp.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.875
Unless you count drug therapy
or electric shock as
activities.

28:58.959 --> 29:01.792
Why would Caroline send you
to a place like that?

29:01.875 --> 29:03.625
She wanted to keep me quiet.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.417
About what?

29:07.792 --> 29:10.041
How she killed my father.

29:15.083 --> 29:17.041
What if she finds me?

29:17.125 --> 29:19.542
She can't.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.417
You're dead, remember?

29:24.667 --> 29:26.333
Your new ID.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.375
I never want to see her again.

29:29.458 --> 29:33.125
Well, next time you do see
her,
it'll be in a court.

29:33.208 --> 29:37.959
I have proof...that your
stepmother poisoned your
father.

29:40.250 --> 29:42.583
Found this in her greenhouse.

29:42.667 --> 29:45.583
Is this what you
saw
her give him?

29:45.667 --> 29:47.000
Yes.

29:47.083 --> 29:51.375
He had a cough, so she made
him some of her special soup.

29:51.458 --> 29:52.417
What is it?

29:52.500 --> 29:53.875
Foxglove.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.041
Deadly poisonous

29:55.125 --> 29:56.875
and can cause a heart attack.

29:56.959 --> 29:59.709
Your stepmom told
him it was
primrose.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.542
So I wasn't imagining things.

30:01.625 --> 30:02.709
Nope.

30:02.792 --> 30:04.125
Of course we can't
prove
any of this

30:04.208 --> 30:06.625
'cause she went
and had the body
cremated.

30:06.709 --> 30:08.917
Will she get away with this?

30:09.000 --> 30:09.875
Don't worry.

30:09.959 --> 30:10.959
Old Harry's still got a few

30:11.041 --> 30:13.208
tricks up his sleeve.

30:13.291 --> 30:14.792
Why are you helping me?

30:16.333 --> 30:18.041
You could've just taken
me back to her

30:18.125 --> 30:20.709
and no one would've ever known
what she did.

30:23.375 --> 30:24.875
I don't know.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.792
Guess I got sick of people
expecting the worst of me.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.709
She'll try to ruin you.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.041
Little late for that.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.125
Might find this hard
to believe

30:37.208 --> 30:39.583
but I used
to be a cop.

30:39.667 --> 30:42.542
You must have been
a good cop.

30:42.625 --> 30:45.583
I had my moments.

30:45.667 --> 30:48.125
Got caught up in some
stuff
I shouldn't have been.

30:49.166 --> 30:51.750
One thing leads
to another and..

30:51.834 --> 30:54.750
...next thing I know
I'm "Anything For A Buck"
Harry.

30:54.834 --> 30:58.041
'Took the money, did the job,
didn't ask questions.'

30:58.125 --> 31:00.875
Didn't matter
which side I was on.

31:00.959 --> 31:02.750
Hell, I figured everybody
was guilty of something

31:02.834 --> 31:04.959
so why not make a buck off it?

31:06.166 --> 31:08.500
But you're helping me.

31:10.834 --> 31:13.083
Got to admit,
it feels pretty good.

31:22.333 --> 31:24.333
Harry was the only one
who believed me.

31:24.417 --> 31:26.000
About Caroline
killing your father.

31:26.083 --> 31:28.792
He said it wasn't the first
time
that she poisoned somebody.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.458
'Said she'd killed her first
husband and that he had
proof.'

31:31.542 --> 31:33.333
Did Harry go to
confront her?

31:34.709 --> 31:36.291
I figured she got to him
like
she did to anybody

31:36.375 --> 31:37.792
who got in her way.

31:37.875 --> 31:41.333
When Harry didn't come back,
French took me to Jersey.

31:41.417 --> 31:45.500
Stanley Hargreave died of a
heart attack in April 1974.

31:45.583 --> 31:46.875
A fit with poisoning?

31:46.959 --> 31:48.125
M.E. said that foxglove

31:48.208 --> 31:49.583
combined with an already
weak heart

31:49.667 --> 31:50.875
will result in a heart attack.

31:50.959 --> 31:52.583
They didn't
catch
it back in the
day.

31:52.667 --> 31:56.208
Stanley was 58 years old,
had a history of heart
trouble.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.709
I mean, there's no
way
of saying for sure

31:57.792 --> 31:59.041
unless we have a body.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.166
Oh, she's come a long way.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.250
Well, you cleaned up pretty
good, Mandy.

32:07.333 --> 32:08.625
Excuse me?

32:09.750 --> 32:12.417
A solicitation charge
in Tulsa.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.500
Everyone has something in their
past that they're ashamed of.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.291
Well, little
more than a few misdemeanors

32:17.375 --> 32:19.667
and a change of name.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.583
I'm no longer
that person.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.542
Moved on.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.458
You killed your way
out of white trash.

32:25.542 --> 32:27.834
What are you talking about?

32:27.917 --> 32:29.333
Ever been married before?

32:29.417 --> 32:33.375
I think you know of my
marriage,
previous to Stan.

32:33.458 --> 32:37.333
Well, Stan wasn't the first
husband to die on you.

32:37.417 --> 32:41.834
Uh, insurance claim
for Melvin Grover.

32:41.917 --> 32:47.250
Autopsy report said he died
of food poisoning in '64.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.625
One was a heart attack

32:48.709 --> 32:50.667
the other an unfortunate
accident.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.917
Unfortunate only that Harry

32:53.000 --> 32:55.083
figured out that
you'd poisoned before.

32:55.166 --> 32:56.458
Is that what this is all about?

32:56.542 --> 32:59.458
Me outliving my husbands?

32:59.542 --> 33:01.333
It happens all the time.

33:01.417 --> 33:03.208
Men are the weaker
of the species.

33:03.291 --> 33:06.500
Genetics had nothing to do
with why you outlived them.

33:06.583 --> 33:07.834
'I wouldn't know
anything about
that.'

33:07.917 --> 33:09.542
Harry did.

33:09.625 --> 33:13.375
Just like he knew why you
wanted
Bunny back so bad.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.792
I wanted to help her.

33:14.875 --> 33:16.375
Bunny was a mixed-up girl.

33:16.458 --> 33:20.208
She seemed pretty clearheaded
when I spoke to her.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.500
What are you talking about?

33:21.583 --> 33:22.875
'Harry faked
Bunny's death.'

33:23.000 --> 33:25.583
And that was a Jane Doe
in that car.

33:27.792 --> 33:30.083
Is this some kind of game?

33:35.709 --> 33:37.667
Bunny knew you poisoned her dad.

33:40.625 --> 33:43.000
You have no proof
of that,
Detective.

33:43.083 --> 33:44.750
Harry did.

33:44.834 --> 33:47.250
And you shot him to silence him.

33:47.333 --> 33:51.041
Why would I do that? Hiring
Mr. Denton was my lawyer's
idea.

33:51.125 --> 33:53.083
- Wilson Katz?
- Yes.

33:53.166 --> 33:56.583
And Harry never contacted
you after the "accident,"
right?

33:56.667 --> 33:59.375
I was busy
arranging
Bunny's funeral.

33:59.458 --> 34:01.375
I let Wilson deal
with everything.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.792
He had power of
attorney
over my affairs.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.125
Of course he did.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.458
Wilson said he would take care

34:07.542 --> 34:11.625
of it and I took
him at his word.

34:11.709 --> 34:13.917
Sit down.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
You're not going anywhere.

34:22.083 --> 34:23.792
I'd like to speak to my lawyer.

34:23.875 --> 34:26.834
Well, he's in the next room,
getting ready to flip on you.

34:26.917 --> 34:29.792
Oh, I doubt that very much.

34:29.875 --> 34:31.917
Huh, that's one cold bitch.

34:33.375 --> 34:36.125
Tracked down the brother
of Caroline's first husband.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.250
Says a lawyer
contacted
him June of '74.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.875
His name's on the
exhumation report.

34:40.959 --> 34:42.208
(Stillman)
"Wilson Katz."

34:42.291 --> 34:44.625
Maybe that's the proof
Harry was talking
about.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.709
Counselor.

34:51.792 --> 34:53.166
I'd like to
speak
with my client

34:53.250 --> 34:54.458
Caroline Hargreave.

34:54.542 --> 34:56.291
She has a right
to legal counsel.

34:56.375 --> 34:59.667
Well, you might want to
consider some for yourself.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.667
What would you like
to know, Detective?

35:02.625 --> 35:04.834
Remember Melvin?

35:04.917 --> 35:06.000
Who?

35:06.083 --> 35:10.834
The first husband
of Mandy Mae Smith.

35:10.917 --> 35:14.291
It's your signature
on the exhumation
request.

35:14.375 --> 35:17.125
I was acting on behalf
of Caroline Hargreave.

35:17.208 --> 35:19.583
Oh, just
loyal
that way?

35:19.667 --> 35:21.500
Digging up her
dead ex-husband

35:21.583 --> 35:23.709
or...something else?

35:25.458 --> 35:27.583
I know how this game
is played, Detective.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.917
Been at it since
before you were born.

35:31.166 --> 35:33.542
You had Caroline's
first husband cremated

35:33.625 --> 35:35.291
a week after Harry was killed.

35:35.375 --> 35:36.750
I had power of attorney
over her affairs.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.208
And power to get rid
of that body, too.

35:39.291 --> 35:41.875
So, you met with Harry
after the accident.

35:41.959 --> 35:43.583
Figure he pointed out

35:43.667 --> 35:45.542
'Caroline's habit of
offing her husbands.'

35:45.625 --> 35:48.208
I already told you
I met with Harry...to pay
him.

35:48.291 --> 35:52.667
That was before we figured out
Harry had Bunny.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.250
If that's all you have,
Detective

35:54.333 --> 35:55.750
I'll take my chances in court.

35:55.834 --> 35:58.333
It's not.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.583
Spoke to the owner
of the building

35:59.667 --> 36:01.709
you buried Harry in.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.834
You put in a bid to buy it.

36:03.917 --> 36:07.250
You were outbid by...ten grand.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.625
You...cheap bastard.

36:11.458 --> 36:13.917
- I know this looks bad bu--
- Eh, save it for the jury.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.500
Tell them how she
put
you up to it.

36:15.583 --> 36:19.250
I was her attorney.
It was my job to protect her.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.917
Yeah, but you
were Harry's
buddy.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.875
At least...he thought so.

36:25.208 --> 36:28.417
If only Harry
had just done his job.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.583
Yeah? What job was that?

36:30.667 --> 36:32.375
Hmm?

36:32.458 --> 36:36.667
Bring Bunny back so
Caroline
could silence her?

36:39.458 --> 36:44.291
Harry tried to tell me, and I..

36:44.375 --> 36:45.625
...wouldn't listen.

36:45.709 --> 36:46.834
To tell you what?

36:46.917 --> 36:49.083
What Caroline was up to?

36:51.458 --> 36:53.333
Look, she's in that room..

36:53.417 --> 36:56.375
'...throwing you under the bus.'

36:56.458 --> 36:59.917
You don't think I know that?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.709
She set the whole
thing up that way.

37:01.792 --> 37:06.291
Then don't let her walk
for what she did to
Harry.

37:06.375 --> 37:07.333
Give me something.

37:07.417 --> 37:08.875
She's smarter than me.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.625
Smarter than Stan.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.208
Even you, Detective.

37:16.291 --> 37:18.959
What does she have over you?

37:19.041 --> 37:23.041
Hey she's...
playing
you for a sucker.

37:23.125 --> 37:24.375
Even now.

37:28.166 --> 37:32.166
She was so beautiful.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.917
Just wanted to make things
right for her.

37:46.208 --> 37:47.709
What's this about, Harry?

37:47.792 --> 37:50.500
I figured I'd give you a
chance
to get in front of this.

37:50.583 --> 37:52.542
What are you talking about?
It's over.

37:52.625 --> 37:55.583
Bunny's dead. Your services
are no longer needed.

37:58.125 --> 38:00.208
Figured out why she wanted
Bunny back so bad.

38:00.291 --> 38:03.166
Whatever Bunny
said to you, it's not true.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.417
Caroline killed
her husband,
Wilson.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.375
Now, I'm guessing she had
a couple of million reasons

38:07.458 --> 38:09.333
to do it, but it's still murder.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.000
Have you been drinking, Harry?

38:11.083 --> 38:12.667
She fed him poison..

38:12.750 --> 38:14.542
...made it look
like a heart attack.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.542
You have no proof of that.

38:16.625 --> 38:17.875
Oh, I have proof.

38:17.959 --> 38:20.583
And Bunny saw
her do it.

38:20.667 --> 38:22.375
Bunny's dead.

38:22.458 --> 38:24.625
It's a real tragedy.

38:24.709 --> 38:26.291
But it's over.

38:26.375 --> 38:28.417
It's not over.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.750
I..

38:33.667 --> 38:35.625
Dragon's eye.

38:35.709 --> 38:37.166
It's just roses.

38:37.250 --> 38:39.375
Guy like you ain't
buying
fresh roses, Wilson.

38:39.458 --> 38:42.041
What'd she do,
wink at you or
something?

38:42.125 --> 38:44.208
No.

38:44.291 --> 38:46.208
It's more than that.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.709
Oh..

38:48.792 --> 38:50.208
Oh, you stupid son of a bitch

38:50.291 --> 38:51.917
you love her, don't you?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.125
Why, she's got you all
turned
around, hasn't she?

38:54.208 --> 38:56.834
Now, I strongly advise
you to walk out that door,
Harry

38:56.917 --> 38:58.750
and forget all about this.

38:58.834 --> 39:01.709
She's done it before, Wilson.

39:01.792 --> 39:03.542
Next time you're
giving
her a foot rub

39:03.625 --> 39:06.583
ask her about her first husband.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.583
Yeah. Didn't know
about that one,
huh?

39:08.667 --> 39:10.417
Name's Melvin Grover.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.583
Married him back when
she was Mandy Mae Smith.

39:12.667 --> 39:15.917
We-Well, you've concocted
a hell of a story.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.041
It's not a story.

39:18.125 --> 39:20.583
And I'm not letting
this get swept under the
rug.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.000
That never stopped you before.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.542
Listen, you dumb bastard,
get away from this.

39:24.625 --> 39:27.083
Get as far away
as you can!

39:27.166 --> 39:28.125
I'm going to the police.

39:28.208 --> 39:31.500
Wait, wait, wait.

39:31.583 --> 39:32.625
What's it gonna cost
for you to forget

39:32.709 --> 39:34.083
this nonsense, huh?

39:36.250 --> 39:37.333
Ten thousand?

39:40.875 --> 39:42.542
Twenty?

39:42.625 --> 39:44.792
I'm not that guy anymore.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.208
Just take the money, Harry.

39:51.917 --> 39:54.000
Now, that's the Harry I know.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.417
I'm going to the police.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.625
With what?

40:00.709 --> 40:02.125
A couple of names?

40:02.208 --> 40:04.458
The ranting's
of a dead girl?

40:04.542 --> 40:07.250
Take the money, Harry.

40:07.333 --> 40:08.750
Not this time.

40:09.834 --> 40:12.834
Stop, stop right there.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.208
You ain't gonna shoot me.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.333
You don't know that.

40:30.750 --> 40:33.834
Must be one hell of a
retainer
she's got you on, Wilson.
