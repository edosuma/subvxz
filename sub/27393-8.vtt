00:10.427 --> 00:12.470
[Alexa]
Christmas is my favorite time of year.

00:12.637 --> 00:15.473
Especially Christmas Eve
when we go to the Christmas festival,

00:15.557 --> 00:17.892
but every year gets
more and more hectic.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.229
That's why my mom and I called
a pre-Christmas meeting last week.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.733
Everyone needs to stay focused
and on schedule.

00:24.816 --> 00:28.570
We are exchanging gifts, then gonna
have dinner at the Christmas festival.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.990
Now, last year, we almost missed it,
and that cannot happen again.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.951
I am not missing ice skating with Santa!

00:35.326 --> 00:37.787
One time, he fell and said a bad word!

00:40.415 --> 00:44.586
And I have a way to simplify
the Mendoza-Cooper gift exchange.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.546
Oh, don't say donations.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.505
Jack!

00:48.256 --> 00:49.924
Where are you going with this, Laurie?

00:51.593 --> 00:55.180
Everybody's going to pick a name,
and you only get a gift for that person.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.433
That sounds so nice!
And so much less expensive.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.643
All right.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.104
Oh, I got Katie!

01:03.855 --> 01:06.191
-Oh, I got Dave!
-Oh, I got you!

01:06.608 --> 01:09.486
What do you want more:
new socks, or a comb?

01:12.989 --> 01:14.032
I got Jennifer.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.116
I got Alexa.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.119
Oh, I got Laurie. [chuckles]
This won't be hard at all.

01:19.704 --> 01:20.747
Lucas! [chuckles]

01:21.706 --> 01:25.085
I mean, I... I think it was Lucas.
[giggles]

01:25.919 --> 01:27.170
Yeah, I guess it was.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.005
[audience laughing]

01:29.130 --> 01:31.174
I lost my paper.
Who did I have again?

01:31.591 --> 01:33.301
-Jennifer.
-No, you have her.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.136
-Somebody better have me.
-You have me, Jack.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.264
-Does anyone wanna trade with me?
-I mean, I would but...

01:39.015 --> 01:41.017
-[indistinct chattering]
-I love Christmas!

01:42.519 --> 01:46.397
[Alexa] So we are all set to have a great
Christmas and not miss the festival.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.233
There is just one more thing to do.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.570
Hmm. Christmas Eve has officially started.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.155
Wait.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.824
[bells jingle]

01:56.199 --> 01:57.534
Now it's started.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.246
♪ I've got you ♪

02:02.205 --> 02:05.166
♪ When I can't take it any longer ♪

02:05.250 --> 02:07.460
♪ You make me feel stronger ♪

02:07.544 --> 02:09.712
♪ I've got you ♪

02:10.255 --> 02:14.050

02:14.342 --> 02:16.511
♪ We'll do this together ♪

02:17.762 --> 02:22.225
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh

♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

02:26.771 --> 02:29.315
♪ We'll do this together ♪

02:29.691 --> 02:33.361
Gingerbread walls look good,
just need a little time to cool.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.363
Then construction begins.

02:36.030 --> 02:40.118
There is no way Nicole Morgan is winning
the Gingerbread House contest this year.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.412
Honey, she's 87, just let her have it.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.872
[audience laughing]

02:43.955 --> 02:45.582
I love the Christmas festival.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.876
[chuckles] It's where I had my first kiss.

02:48.334 --> 02:52.422
Oh, yeah, your lips got stuck
to the ice sculpture princess.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.008
I was six. And thirsty.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.303
Found our skates!

02:58.511 --> 02:59.679
Oh, hey!

03:00.263 --> 03:02.432
And an angry family of possums.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.893
That will be a January project...

03:05.810 --> 03:06.686
for Lucas.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.647
Yeah, I'm booked until March.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.695
Whoa, that's a big gift you got me!

03:16.029 --> 03:17.530
Yeah, you're gonna love it!

03:17.947 --> 03:19.657
I hope it wasn't too expensive.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.367
Oh, it's really expensive!

03:21.618 --> 03:23.620
[audience laughing]

03:24.370 --> 03:26.456
All I got him was a small model airplane.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.417
-It's the thought that counts.
-Kids can't play with thoughts, Laurie!

03:29.500 --> 03:31.502
[audience laughing]

03:32.170 --> 03:34.088
Oh, and my mom's working on your gift.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.716
She says it's perfect,
and she's going to win Christmas.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.220
[chuckles] It's not a competition.
She said "perfect"?

03:41.262 --> 03:44.349
Mom, don't ask.
It's part of the fun of Christmas!

03:44.807 --> 03:47.810
-Like wearing your Christmas sweater.
-Well, it wouldn't fit over my cast.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.354
Well I have one that'll work.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.233
Okay, I'm thinking... snowflakes. Ooh!

03:53.316 --> 03:55.026
Maybe a cat with antlers.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.819
Just no elves.

03:57.904 --> 03:58.780
That's my thing.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.449
Okay, I won't wear elves.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.910
Hey, I'm gonna wear elves.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.080
Look. [clears throat]

04:07.163 --> 04:10.041
I don't know what Jennifer got me,
but it sounds like she went all out.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.126
So you better have gotten
her something really good.

04:12.877 --> 04:13.836
I had Jennifer?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.005
Lucas! Really?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.298
I forgot.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.094
That's why we called the family meeting,
so Christmas would stay on track.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.387
In my defense...

04:24.806 --> 04:26.474
Doesn't saying that
get people off the hook?

04:26.557 --> 04:29.018
Okay, we're exchanging gifts
in a couple of hours.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.272
Okay? You're going out right now
and getting her something good.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.441
I'm coming with you.
I've gotta add to Jack's present.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.403
[sighs] I should have seen this coming.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.737
The boy looks up to me.

04:42.907 --> 04:46.411
Which one says "9-year-old boy
with a broken arm"?

04:51.249 --> 04:52.166
This one!

04:54.127 --> 04:57.046
I am finally done with Lucas's present.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.631
Is that Bunny?

04:58.798 --> 05:01.926
The last time I saw him, he was
in a pile of rags in the Goodwill box.

05:02.218 --> 05:05.847
I know! I couldn't believe
your mom was giving away Lucas's...

05:05.972 --> 05:07.640
beloved childhood friend.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.101
So, I grabbed Bunny and repaired him,

05:10.727 --> 05:13.354
knowing one day there would be
a perfect opportunity

05:13.438 --> 05:15.106
to give him back to Lucas. Hmm.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.566
That's so thoughtful...

05:16.941 --> 05:18.234
and only a little creepy.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.487
You just focus on my gift.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.490
Oh, what's that?

05:29.620 --> 05:32.081
It's my bag from when I was first
in the hospital.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.293
I didn't even know I still had this.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.795
Yeah, it seems like... forever ago.

05:39.714 --> 05:40.548
Yeah.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.426
Okay, so... so should I wrap Bunny?

05:43.801 --> 05:45.803
Or is he a gift-bag bunny?

05:46.721 --> 05:49.223
[Katie] Or is he a bow-around-the-neck
kind of guy?

05:50.975 --> 05:53.686
[Katie's voice faints]
Or should I say it's a combo?

05:53.853 --> 05:55.688
You get it, you get it.

05:55.772 --> 05:56.689
[Alexa flashbacks]

05:56.898 --> 05:58.149
I don't understand.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.360
Was it something I did?

06:01.152 --> 06:04.572
-Honey, it's nothing you did.
-I know it's overwhelming, but trust me.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.158
You are getting
the best possible treatment.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.078
Now that we know
the type of leukemia you have,

06:10.536 --> 06:13.581
we're gonna keep you here for a few weeks
while you get a high dose of chemo.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.125
Unfortunately, it's going to make you
feel pretty lousy,

06:16.292 --> 06:18.669
but it's also going to kill
your leukemia cells.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.089
It's gonna be tough, sweetie,
but you can do this.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.216
The goal is to get you to remission.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.927
We'll check your blood daily
and eventually we'll...

06:26.135 --> 06:29.555
we'll schedule another bone marrow
aspiration to monitor your progress.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.849
[medical equipment beeping]

06:33.101 --> 06:34.102
[Katie] You know what?

06:35.103 --> 06:36.521
I'm just gonna wrap him.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.564
It... it doesn't really matter,

06:38.648 --> 06:40.358
it just has to be good.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.276
That's all. [chuckles]

06:48.157 --> 06:49.867
[line rings then a chime]

06:49.951 --> 06:51.577
Megan, Merry Christmas!

06:51.702 --> 06:53.663
Alexa, I'm so glad it's you.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.291
My grandma got an iPhone
and has been butt dialing me, all day.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.919
[chuckles] Happy to see you, too.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.130
I RSVPed for your Sweet 16.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.716
I don't know if I'm more excited
about the photo booth or the dessert bar.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.385
Or seeing me?

07:08.052 --> 07:10.304
-Yes, by the dessert bar.
-[Alexa laughs]

07:12.140 --> 07:12.974
So...

07:14.600 --> 07:18.855
I found my old hospital bag in my closet
and it brought me right back.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.773
Ugh, I hate when that happens.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.110
It's like cancer's jumping out
from under your bed and saying "Boo!"

07:24.277 --> 07:25.194
Exactly.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.281
And now I'm thinking about it
and it's hard to not think about it.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.490
Well, don't.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.910
Don't you have some old lady to crush
in a Gingerbread House contest?

07:33.953 --> 07:34.996
Yeah, I do.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.959
Just... put cancer back under the bed
and get your Christmas on.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.587
You're right.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.672
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.008
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.384
All right, bye, Megan.

07:50.136 --> 07:50.970
[sighs]

07:53.222 --> 07:56.058
All right, Christmas, we're doing this.

08:00.771 --> 08:01.731
"En route"?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.525
You've been en route for two hours!

08:05.151 --> 08:06.527
What does "en route" mean?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.738
It's French for "awful."

08:11.115 --> 08:13.784
First... first I get Laurie,
which was a nightmare.

08:13.910 --> 08:19.165
Then, I find a beautiful and cheap
rocking chair online. Amazing.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.833
And now it doesn't arrive!

08:20.917 --> 08:21.751
Nightmare!

08:22.418 --> 08:25.046
This is how I'm rewarded
for shopping ahead of time?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.423
Didn't you order it two days ago?

08:27.507 --> 08:28.466
Yeah, thank you.

08:30.051 --> 08:35.640
You see, this is why I spend so much time
and attention on my gift for Lucas.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.684
Potato!

08:39.143 --> 08:42.313
No, no, no! Bad Potato, bad Potato!

08:43.773 --> 08:46.025
I think I forgot to feed Potato.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.321
Jack, check it out!

08:50.821 --> 08:54.700
-Huh, it's a Christmas miracle!
-I told you you needed a sweater.

08:55.117 --> 08:55.952
[Jack grunts]

08:56.244 --> 08:59.038
My gift for Lucas is... ruined.

08:59.288 --> 09:03.251
No. no, no. No one is losing
their Christmas spirit on my watch.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.502
You can still fix it.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.463
Did Rudolph give up when all the reindeer
laughed and called him names?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.423
He did. He was pretty upset.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.883
I meant at the end, Jack!

09:10.967 --> 09:12.134
-C'mon.
-[doorbell rings]

09:12.218 --> 09:14.345
Ah, finally! Yes!

09:15.596 --> 09:18.224
I have been waiting all day! [chuckles]

09:18.891 --> 09:20.017
Oh, Ryan.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.354
Merry Christmas!
Just dropping off a gift for Katie.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.108
-Oh, that's so sweet.
-Yeah, it's nothing.

09:27.483 --> 09:31.070
Oh, it's not nothing! It's something.
I wouldn't put nothing in a bag!

09:31.153 --> 09:32.113
Oh, c'mon in.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.573
Move, move! It's UPS.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.158
[giggles] Oh!

09:36.367 --> 09:39.412
Um, oh, this can't be my package. Ugh!

09:39.495 --> 09:42.039
I'm gonna leave this for Katie.
Merry Christmas!

09:42.331 --> 09:44.250
To you and your whole... Yeah.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.002
No.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.589
They sent me the wrong package!
I ordered a rocking chair.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.382
[sighs]

09:51.549 --> 09:52.633
Customer service.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.096
Cus-to-mer ser-vice!

09:58.389 --> 10:00.308
Uh, Mom?

10:02.018 --> 10:03.644
What in the North Pole is that?

10:04.937 --> 10:07.565
Oh, Laurie's gonna think this is so funny!

10:08.149 --> 10:12.236
It's supposed to be a rocking chair
that she can enjoy on her patio!

10:13.321 --> 10:16.240
Oh, then this is really disappointing.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.367
[audience laughing]

10:19.619 --> 10:21.495
See? He's better already.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.789
Gift good, back on track.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.000
I wouldn't let anything spoil Christmas.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.920
Yeah, I was there when you yelled
at the mall Santa

10:30.004 --> 10:31.380
for not being jolly enough.

10:31.589 --> 10:36.260
Hey, if I'm getting a Christmas photo
with you, you better "Ho Ho Ho" it up.

10:37.386 --> 10:41.057
Okay, the ear is back on.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.393
You hang in there, Bunny.
We are almost done...

10:45.102 --> 10:46.228
Almost done.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.064
-[Alexa flashbacks]
-[Laurie] Almost done.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.024
Almost done.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.402
[sighs] I don't want it.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.072
-Honey, just a little more.
-You have to keep your strength up.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.823
[exhales] I don't feel good.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.158
[Alexa breathing heavily]

10:59.241 --> 11:01.035
-Should I get someone?
-She's okay.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.038
-She'll be okay.
-[Alexa huffs]

11:04.288 --> 11:06.082
[Alexa takes a deep breath]

11:06.207 --> 11:07.333
[Katie] Check it out.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.001
Huh?

11:09.543 --> 11:11.754
The bunny is done-y.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.174
Oh, I heard it in my head, and...

11:15.383 --> 11:16.634
I said it anyway.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.930
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's gonna love it.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.183
[chuckles] Thanks. You know I can't wait
to see what you got me.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.061
Oh my gosh!
I still have to wrap your gift.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.356
And work on my gingerbread house.
I have a lot to do.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.114
Keep walking, Potato.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.620
I'm glad we decided to eat dinner
at the Festival this year.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.665
Who needs a meal cooked
with love and care

11:47.748 --> 11:49.875
when we can slurp dinner
off a paper plate?

11:51.252 --> 11:52.795
I'm gonna bring our silverware.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.882
Hey. Honey...
you're frosting your shoulder.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.760
Oh, shoot. [hawks softly]

12:01.554 --> 12:03.347
-[Laurie] Mmm. Hey!
-Hey.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.600
Uh, the mall was so packed.
So we hit the drugstore.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.978
-What'd you get?
-So much stuff.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.732
-Uh, hair gel, cologne, body wash--
-I meant for Jennifer.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.567
What did you get for Jennifer?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.319
We're opening gifts soon!

12:18.529 --> 12:20.406
I still have to wrap Katie's present!

12:20.489 --> 12:21.782
[sweater bells jingle]

12:21.907 --> 12:23.909
Dave, that is too much for Jack!

12:24.034 --> 12:26.036
You need to find something for Jennifer.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.415
-A family photo of the Mendozas?
-No!

12:30.916 --> 12:33.127
Oh! A thing holding a thing.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.128
Lucas!

12:34.503 --> 12:36.380
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.049
[Laurie huffs]

12:39.425 --> 12:40.259
No!

12:40.509 --> 12:42.511
[audience laughing]

12:47.308 --> 12:50.644
You could say it's a footrest
for a one-legged pirate.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.606
Or a place for a candle to relax.

12:54.815 --> 12:59.195
Okay, Bunny is fixed...
and safely hidden from Potato.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.157
You have really put a lot of thought
into Lucas's gift.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.202
What's this?

13:06.744 --> 13:08.746
Oh, Ryan dropped that off earlier.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.210
Oh my gosh!

13:16.253 --> 13:19.256
Uh, these... these are my flowers
from Romeo and Juliet.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.802
I mean,
he must have saved them for me.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.430
Ryan really put a lot of thought
into that gift.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.057
Yeah.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.558
Yeah, he did. [chuckles]

13:31.852 --> 13:33.312
Oh! It is so pretty.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.023
Any chance I can give this to Laurie?

13:37.399 --> 13:39.401
Okay, I've got to thank him.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.696
Um... I...

13:43.322 --> 13:44.573
I don't know what to say.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.119
[dog growls]

13:49.995 --> 13:52.164
No! Potato! Uh.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.506
You know what?

14:00.589 --> 14:02.925
I should have just left Bunny
in that Goodwill box

14:03.008 --> 14:04.552
with Dave's old overalls,

14:05.052 --> 14:06.679
and Laurie's lace-up jeans.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.223
[Jennifer] You can fix him!

14:10.015 --> 14:12.476
Hey, at least he's not
a tiny rocking chair!

14:33.163 --> 14:35.165
[Alexa flashbacks]

14:35.332 --> 14:36.500
Here you go, honey.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.252
-Take it slow, hon.
-[Alexa exhales]

14:38.627 --> 14:40.379
I'm so happy to see my own bed.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.884
Do you need any water?
I can make it room temp,

14:45.009 --> 14:47.011
-cold, slightly iced--
-No, thanks.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.472
I just want to find a plain spot
on the wall to focus on

14:50.556 --> 14:51.974
until the room stops spinning.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.684
Like you did at the hospital.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.021
Okay, well, if you need anything,
I put a bell on your nightstand

14:57.104 --> 15:00.816
and my phone is fully charged.
Oh, and your dad installed a generator.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.153
You're letting me out of your sight?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.989
I figured you'd be camping out
at the foot of my bed.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.408
What?
[laughs] No!

15:10.618 --> 15:12.828
No. Don't be ridiculous.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.955
[sighs]

15:16.040 --> 15:18.083
-Mom?
-Yeah, what do you need?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.252
You're blocking my spot.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.046
Oh, right.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.128
[Laurie] Alexa!

16:45.045 --> 16:46.797
We're about to open gifts!

16:46.922 --> 16:48.674
What? Already?

16:50.926 --> 16:53.512
[Jennifer giggles] Oh. Ah, well...

16:54.221 --> 16:56.306
-Here's your gift!
-[Laurie chuckles]

16:58.976 --> 17:02.521
Ooh! It's my name.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.984
Spelled with pieces
of a tiny rocking chair.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.445
Thanks.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.949
That reminds me I need to get
a rocking chair for my antique doll. Hmm.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.163
Okay.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.164
My turn!

17:20.831 --> 17:23.459
[clears throat then chuckles]

17:23.917 --> 17:24.918
Hope you like it.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.546
It's Bunny!

17:27.671 --> 17:30.299
Yes, it is. I stitched him up.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.259
Potato!

17:33.343 --> 17:34.178
It's okay.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.179
He loves it.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.972
Uh, um, yeah.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.433
Thanks, Katie.
I don't know what to say.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.396
What an incredibly thoughtful gift.
[giggles]

17:44.521 --> 17:46.523
[audience laughing]

17:47.816 --> 17:49.818
[typing on cell-phone]

17:57.117 --> 18:01.705
Oh! Can't wait to see
what I got from Jack. [sighs]

18:04.124 --> 18:05.209
It's a bomber jacket.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.545
It's my bomber jacket.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.966
Yeah. Right after I got your name,
I took it from your closet.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.595
Last week you were talking about
how it was missing and how you loved it.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.889
And I knew I got you the perfect gift.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.308
[audience laughing]

18:22.643 --> 18:23.811
Here's yours.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.399
Whoa! You got me so many presents!

18:29.691 --> 18:34.321
Ooh! Slinky, Apple gift card! Silly Putty!

18:35.030 --> 18:37.032
Ooh, People magazine?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.702
Loofah! Oh!

18:42.079 --> 18:44.248
Hey, aren't you going to try on
your jacket?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.458
I know it fits. Give me that loofah.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.588
Merry Christmas, Jennifer.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.633
Coupons and bonus bucks?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.263
You basically gave me money. Oh!

19:02.099 --> 19:03.100
Alexa, you're up.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.519
Your gift for Katie.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.022
Oh no, I forgot to wrap your gift!

19:09.815 --> 19:12.276
Hurry! The festival starts in ten minutes.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.736
But I still need to finish
my gingerbread house.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.405
Honey, you've had all day.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.074
Yeah, we've gotta make it
to the Christmas Festival.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.701
You called the family meeting.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.870
Fine, then just go without me.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.997
Whoa. What's going on?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.081
Alexa!

19:26.415 --> 19:28.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.840
Whoa! A model airplane!

19:35.674 --> 19:38.343
You know,
that would have been enough, Dave.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.429
[audience laughing]

19:42.306 --> 19:43.307
[knock on door]

19:45.225 --> 19:47.686
Sorry. I just need a minute.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.854
What's wrong?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.272
It's stupid.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.399
[Laurie] Honey, tell us.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.446
I keep thinking about
when I first got sick.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.031
What?

19:59.907 --> 20:04.077
I found my old hospital bag in my closet
and it completely caught me off-guard.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.288
Why didn't you tell us?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.248
Or... me?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.001
I was trying not to think about it.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.713
Are you worried?
All your checkups have been great.

20:14.796 --> 20:15.797
No, it's not that.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.007
It's just...

20:17.382 --> 20:19.551
sometimes when you get reminded,

20:19.968 --> 20:23.055
it can take over,
and it brings you right back there,

20:23.180 --> 20:25.182
feeling everything all over again.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.977
I was so caught up in that dumb bunny.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.188
There's no way that you could have known.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.775
It's been a long time
since I've been sick, but...

20:35.400 --> 20:38.028
there are days I just can't seem
to get away from it.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.739
Even in my own room.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.575
[Dave] The wall.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.580
The spot you used to stare at when you
thought you were going to get sick.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.541
[tsks] Honey, I'm so sorry
you're going through this.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.001
I'm sorry I didn't know.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.379
Yeah, me too. That must feel lonely.

20:55.879 --> 20:56.797
Sometimes.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.509
[tsks] You know, you've been keeping in
a lot lately.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.261
You didn't even want to talk about Dylan.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.138
Or how you were nervous
about your doctor's appointment.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.224
Well, sweetie, we're always here.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.268
But your mom and I have been thinking...

21:09.518 --> 21:11.770
it might help you to talk
with a therapist.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.355
Maybe.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.067
Thanks.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.443
Now let's go,

21:18.527 --> 21:21.405
because I don't wanna be the reason
we missed the Christmas Festival.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.407
Actually, I have a better idea.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.578
["Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"
playing]

21:30.956 --> 21:32.791
Oh, this was a great idea.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.128
Thanks, you guys.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.880
I know this isn't our typical
Christmas Eve.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.258
Hmm? We're all together.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.843
There's music playing.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.053
[chuckles] Feels like Christmas to me.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.223
I like this new tradition.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.642
Next year, let's do my laundry room.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.060
[Dave chuckles]

21:52.978 --> 21:54.104
Looking good. [sighs]

21:54.938 --> 21:55.939
Just one more spot.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.026
Alexa, do you want to do the honors?

22:17.002 --> 22:17.919
What do you think?

22:22.716 --> 22:24.426
I've never been sick in this room.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.795
