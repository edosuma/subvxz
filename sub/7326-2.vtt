00:02.273 --> 00:04.575
(Banks' "Before I Ever Met You"
playing)

00:04.575 --> 00:07.208
(Richard)
THE WAITING CAN KILL YOU.

00:07.208 --> 00:10.211
(monitor beeping steadily,
air whooshes in pump)

00:10.211 --> 00:12.213
YOU MAKE A DECISION,

00:12.213 --> 00:14.385
AND THEN THE WORLD
HAS TO TURN.

00:14.385 --> 00:17.118
♪♪♪

00:18.189 --> 00:21.152
(monitor beeping steadily,
suction gurgling))

00:24.755 --> 00:28.259
THE CONSEQUENCES UNFOLD...

00:28.259 --> 00:30.161
OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

00:30.161 --> 00:32.633
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT SEEMS CLEAR...
(thunderclap)

00:32.633 --> 00:35.166
IN THOSE QUIET MOMENTS
WHILE YOU WAIT.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.308
WHATEVER YOU CHOSE WAS WRONG.

00:37.308 --> 00:39.540
YOU THINK HE PUT YOU
IN HIS WILL?
NO.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.812
NEXT OF KIN.

00:41.812 --> 00:44.215
MAYBE YOU GET THE HOUSE.
I HAVE A HOUSE.

00:44.215 --> 00:46.777
WELL, YOU CAN GIVE ME HIS HOUSE.
I MEAN, I COULD USE A HOUSE.

00:46.777 --> 00:48.119
HE'S NOT MY FATHER.

00:48.119 --> 00:49.280
I'VE BEEN TELLING HIM THIS
FOR YEARS.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.481
HE JUST FEELS GUILTY

00:50.481 --> 00:52.153
BECAUSE HE BUSTED UP
MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.825
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.
IT IS NOW.

00:54.825 --> 00:57.828
YEAH, I MEAN, STICKING ME
WITH HIS END OF LIFE CARE--

00:57.828 --> 01:00.361
DOESN'T ASK,
DOESN'T GIVE ME AN OUT--

01:00.361 --> 01:03.194
THAT'S REAL LOVE.
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
FAMILY TO ME.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.266
MAYBE HE IS YOUR FATHER.
BANGED YOUR MOM ENOUGH.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.139
ALEX.
DID THEY KNOW EACH OTHER
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN?

01:08.139 --> 01:09.800
THEY MET WHEN I WAS 3.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.204
MM-HMM. YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD YOU.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.146
(magazine rustles)
I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE E.R.

01:15.146 --> 01:17.748
(rings and vibrates)

01:17.748 --> 01:18.809
OW.
OH, NO, NO.
LET ME GET IT.

01:18.809 --> 01:22.183
THIS IS YANG.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.115
AND HOW ABOUT BROOKS?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.718
(elevator bell dings,
indistinct conversations)

01:27.718 --> 01:29.160
HEY.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.421
I KNOW. I'M FINE.

01:30.421 --> 01:32.363
HEY, LOOK. I NEED TO RUN
TO MY NEC FASC SURGERY.

01:32.363 --> 01:34.195
HE'S IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.
NO.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.427
BAILEY FEELS LIKE THERE'S LIKELY
SOME INTERNAL NECROSIS.

01:36.427 --> 01:37.828
SO SHE TOOK HIM UP
TO THE O.R.

01:37.828 --> 01:40.531
WITH THIS KIND
OF CARDIAC COMPROMISE?
YEAH--AND SHE--

01:40.531 --> 01:42.673
UNH-UNH.
SHE--MOM. MOM?

01:42.673 --> 01:44.235
LOOK...

01:44.235 --> 01:47.838
(monitor beeping erratically)

01:47.838 --> 01:48.839
I NEED HUNT IN HERE.
(instruments clatter)

01:48.839 --> 01:50.241
I CAN TRY TO--
NOW!

01:50.241 --> 01:53.844
READY? GO. TWO, THREE...

01:53.844 --> 01:57.288
(monitor continues beeping
erratically)

02:00.251 --> 02:02.253
BOWELS ARE COMPLETELY CLEAN.

02:02.253 --> 02:03.624
SHOULD WE RECHECK
THE PELVIS?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.196
I HAVE, FOUR TIMES.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.302
(slaps intercom)
What the hell
do you think you're doing--

02:11.302 --> 02:13.204
cutting open a man
in cardiogenic shock

02:13.204 --> 02:15.206
with nothing on his C.T.?

02:15.206 --> 02:17.238
There's dead tissue
somewhere inside him.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.240
I'd like to find it
before it kills him.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.911
He can't handle this stress

02:20.911 --> 02:23.444
until his cardiac status
is stabilized!

02:23.444 --> 02:25.446
Get him off that table!

02:25.446 --> 02:26.677
LAP PAD, PLEASE.

02:26.677 --> 02:28.549
Dr. Hunt!
DR. AVERY,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU

02:28.549 --> 02:30.381
to keep it down
while we're doing our work.

02:30.381 --> 02:32.923
(monitor beeping erratically)

02:32.923 --> 02:35.186
HUH, THERE'S A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

02:35.186 --> 02:37.728
PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
IS HIS DOPAMINE MAXED OUT?
YEAH, IT'S AT 20.

02:37.728 --> 02:39.230
CLOSE THE PATIENT!

02:39.230 --> 02:41.262
COME ON.
WHERE ARE YOU?

02:41.262 --> 02:44.265
DR. HUNT!
BROOKS IS CRASHING.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.567
BAILEY, HE'S HAVING RUNS
OF V-tach.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.769
(muffled voice)
CLOSE... HIM... UP!

02:48.769 --> 02:51.542
(monitor continues beeping
erratically)

02:53.874 --> 02:55.576
CLOSING.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.248
CAN YOU GET BY WITHOUT ME?
JUST GO.

02:58.949 --> 03:02.213
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

03:12.663 --> 03:14.295
(breathing heavily)

03:16.827 --> 03:18.599
(exhales deeply)

03:18.599 --> 03:20.931
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING
WITH BROOKS?

03:20.931 --> 03:24.935
(siren wailing in distance)

03:29.310 --> 03:30.411
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

03:30.411 --> 03:31.412
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.544
YOU GOTTA DRINK
THE JUICE, MAN.

03:33.544 --> 03:35.346
YOU GIVE US HALF YOUR BLOOD
AND HEAD BACK TO THE PILE,

03:35.346 --> 03:37.488
YOU'RE GONNA PASS OUT.
(slurps)

03:37.488 --> 03:39.650
(indistinct conversations)

03:39.650 --> 03:41.322
(voice breaking)
HEATHER DIDN'T MAKE IT.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.897
COME ON.

04:01.272 --> 04:02.813
(sheet rustles)

04:08.279 --> 04:11.282
(sighs)

04:11.282 --> 04:13.784
I'M GONNA GIVE THE INTERNS
THE REST OF THE NIGHT OFF.

04:13.784 --> 04:15.586
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THEY DROP?

04:15.586 --> 04:16.627
OF COURSE.

04:16.627 --> 04:18.929
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT HEATHER.

04:18.929 --> 04:21.392
(whispers) YEAH.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.263
DR. HUNT,
LYDIA'S DESATTING,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.034
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE LEFT.

04:24.034 --> 04:25.596
WHA--
SHARPIE LADY.

04:25.596 --> 04:26.697
OH.
SHOULD I THROW IN
A CHEST TUBE?

04:26.697 --> 04:28.699
DR. YANG IS GONNA
TAKE OVER THAT CASE.

04:28.699 --> 04:29.970
WHY? I CAN HANDLE
A CHEST TUBE.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.575
OH, MY GOD.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.948
I GOT A WOMAN WITH
NECROTIZING FASCIITIS,

04:37.948 --> 04:38.979
AND THE INTERNS
AREN'T OPERATING.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.411
SO CAN YOU--
OF COURSE.

04:40.411 --> 04:42.383
WELL, SHE'S ALREADY
ON THE TABLE,

04:42.383 --> 04:44.284
AND THE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS
ARE LINING HER UP.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.788
BE READY IN TEN.
OKAY. HEY...

04:47.788 --> 04:51.362
IT'S JUST TERRIBLE.

04:51.362 --> 04:53.794
(voice breaking)
JACKSON.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.527
(sniffling)
(lowered voice)
OH, HEY. I'M SORRY.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.413
AND WHAT ABOUT RICHARD?

05:12.413 --> 05:13.684
STILL CRITICAL,

05:13.684 --> 05:16.086
BUT HIS PRESSURE STABILIZED
ONCE BAILEY CLOSED.

05:16.086 --> 05:19.350
SO BAILEY CLOSED
BECAUSE HIS VITALS TANKED,

05:19.350 --> 05:23.023
OR BECAUSE CATHERINE AVERY
WAS IN THE GALLERY SCREAMING?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.927
OH, DEREK.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.861
(telephone rings in distance)

05:34.104 --> 05:35.065
YOU HEARD ABOUT BROOKS?

05:35.065 --> 05:37.868
(exhales deeply)

05:37.868 --> 05:39.810
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.473
(sighs)

05:42.473 --> 05:45.946
CAN WE HAVE A CONVERSATION?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.548
NOT NOW.

05:50.981 --> 05:53.524
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD.

05:53.524 --> 05:56.126
AND TELLING EVERYONE--
I GUESS...

05:56.126 --> 06:00.491
I DESERVED THAT.

06:00.491 --> 06:04.595
BUT IF WE COULD JUST--
I SAID NOT NOW.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.401
(man) HEY, IT'S RIGHT BEHIND ME!

06:10.401 --> 06:12.072
ARE YOU HEADED BACK OUT?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.674
(siren wailing in distance)

06:13.674 --> 06:15.506
BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

06:15.506 --> 06:18.008
IT WAS AVERY, RIGHT?

06:18.008 --> 06:19.910
HE'S THE GUY THAT YOU...

06:19.910 --> 06:22.883
(sighs) I GET IT.
HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.055
PRACTICALLY RUNS THE HOSPITAL.
MATTHEW--

06:25.055 --> 06:26.587
AND I PROPOSED TO YOU
IN FRONT OF A HUNDRED PEOPLE.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.918
I DIDN'T REALLY GIVE YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY "NO."

06:27.918 --> 06:29.089
SO...

06:31.021 --> 06:33.163
DID YOU WANT TO SAY "NO"?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.003
(vehicle door opens)

06:43.003 --> 06:44.104
(door closes)

06:44.104 --> 06:46.106
(siren wailing in distance)

06:46.106 --> 06:49.139
(keys jangle)

06:49.139 --> 06:50.811
CALLIE?

06:56.086 --> 06:57.688
(clanks, keys clatter)

07:19.069 --> 07:21.572
CALLIE?

07:24.515 --> 07:26.747
(crib scrapes floor)

07:32.623 --> 07:40.861
CALLIE?!

07:44.965 --> 07:46.096
WE GOT THE CLOT OUT,

07:46.096 --> 07:47.568
BUT THERE WAS JUST
SO MUCH SWELLING.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.740
(fusses)
COULDN'T GET IT TO STOP.

07:51.942 --> 07:53.243
DID YOU TELL THE FAMILY?

07:53.243 --> 07:55.205
YEAH, I HAD SOMEONE
CALL HER MOM WHEN WE FOUND HER

07:55.205 --> 07:56.947
AND TELL HER THAT
SHE WAS INJURED.

07:56.947 --> 08:00.210
SHE'S COMING DOWN
FROM SOMEPLACE IN OREGON.

08:00.210 --> 08:01.782
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL HER

08:01.782 --> 08:03.714
WHEN SHE WAS STILL
ON THE ROAD.
(sighs)

08:07.618 --> 08:09.690
OKAY, SO YOU NEED TO GO
TO THE DAY CARE

08:09.690 --> 08:11.491
AND PICK UP ZOLA
BECAUSE SHE'S GONNA THINK

08:11.491 --> 08:13.624
WE HAD A BABY
AND FORGOT ABOUT HER.

08:13.624 --> 08:15.125
I'LL CALL THE BABYSITTER
AND TELL HER

08:15.125 --> 08:16.827
TO MEET YOU AT THE HOUSE
IN AN HOUR.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.098
AND YOU SHOULD TELL
THE INTERNS

08:18.098 --> 08:20.671
TO HANG OUT AND WAIT
TILL HEATHER'S MOM ARRIVES.

08:22.533 --> 08:24.504
(cries)

08:24.504 --> 08:25.505
GIVE ME THE BABY.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.008
(whispers) OKAY.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.011
(fussing)

08:33.814 --> 08:36.516
I KNOW.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.890
(breathing heavily)
(rail clacks)

08:39.890 --> 08:41.892
(Velcro rips)

08:41.892 --> 08:43.153
THAT IS A LOT OF BLOOD.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.826
SHOULD I BOOK AN O.R.?
NO, NOT YET.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.658
WE'LL MONITOR HER
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS

08:47.658 --> 08:48.298
AND THEN DECIDE.

08:48.298 --> 08:52.633
(pants) MY--MY HOUSE.

08:54.565 --> 08:57.037
MA'AM, YOU'VE LOST
QUITE A LOT OF BLOOD.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.639
YOU SHOULD REST.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.571
I-I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT
THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

09:00.571 --> 09:04.044
OH. (inhales deeply)

09:04.044 --> 09:05.876
YOU CAN'T SCREAM
AT MY DOCTORS WHEN THERE IS

09:05.876 --> 09:07.618
AN OPEN BODY ON THE TABLE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LET HER TALK YOU INTO

09:07.618 --> 09:10.721
A BOONDOGGLE LIKE THAT.
DR. AVERY, IF YOU HAVE ANY
ISSUES WITH--

09:10.721 --> 09:13.153
DOES HE KNOW WHY YOU CUT OPEN
A MAN IN SEVERE CARDIAC DISTRESS

09:13.153 --> 09:15.786
JUST SO YOU COULD POKE AROUND
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:15.786 --> 09:17.628
WE LOOKED AT
ALL OF THE OPTIONS.
TELL HIM.

09:17.628 --> 09:19.559
YOU TELL HIM YOU FEEL GUILTY

09:19.559 --> 09:21.091
BECAUSE THE LAST THING
RICHARD WEBBER HEARD FROM YOU

09:21.091 --> 09:24.334
IS THAT HE'S A DRUNK
WHO RUINED YOUR LIFE.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.296
AFTER ALL HE'S DONE FOR YOU.

09:26.296 --> 09:29.039
WE TALK ON THE PHONE
FOR AN HOUR EVERY NIGHT.

09:29.039 --> 09:30.671
IT CAME UP.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.142
YOU FEEL BAD,
GO FIND A PRIEST.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.274
BUT DO NOT TRY TO FIX IT
WITH A HAIL MARY

09:34.274 --> 09:37.577
THAT VERY WELL MAY
KILL THE MAN!

09:37.577 --> 09:40.911
I WANT ACCESS TO HIS CHARTS...
(whispers) RIGHT NOW.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.655
I'LL BE BACK IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

09:44.655 --> 09:46.657
HEATHER'S MOTHER
WON'T PROBABLY BE HERE YET,

09:46.657 --> 09:49.119
BUT IF SHE IS,
UH, SOMEONE STAY WITH HER

09:49.119 --> 09:50.621
UNTIL I GET BACK.
WE DON'T TELL HER, DO WE?

09:50.621 --> 09:51.892
NO, I WILL.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.293
JUST THINK
OF SOME GOOD HEATHER STORIES.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.825
ONCE SHE KNOWS,

09:54.825 --> 09:56.827
SHE'S GONNA WANT TO KNOW
THAT SHE DIED AMONG FRIENDS.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.208
WHO'S GONNA WAIT?
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.
SHE'LL SEE IT IN MY FACE.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.143
WHAT THE HELL IS HIS PROBLEM?
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WERE FRIENDS.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.315
I AM NOT WAITING
WITH HER ALONE.
I'M NOT EITHER.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.317
OKAY. NOBODY GOES.
WE ALL WAIT.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.289
NOW GO FIND SHANE AND TELL HIM
WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER.

10:19.289 --> 10:21.621
WHAT ARE YOU, MY MOTHER?
YOU FIND HIM.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.753
(telephone rings in distance)

10:22.753 --> 10:24.324
YES, YES, YES.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.926
(Cristina) HEY.
HEY, CAN YOU WATCH HER
FOR A MINUTE?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.257
YEAH.
I NEED TO GET MY LAPTOP.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.800
COME HERE.
(speaks indistinctly)

10:29.800 --> 10:30.801
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:30.801 --> 10:33.333
MY WIFE'S AN S-L-U-T.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.235
SOFIA AND I ARE
SPENDING THE NIGHT AT A HOTEL.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.767
(Sofia babbles)
A-AND THEN WHAT?

10:36.767 --> 10:38.869
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:38.869 --> 10:40.410
(Sofia babbles)

10:40.410 --> 10:42.713
WE'RE GONNA LET HER
STAY AT A HOTEL?

10:43.974 --> 10:46.316
SO IS THIS THE WOMAN

10:46.316 --> 10:48.949
WHOSE FIANCé IS ALSO
A FIREFIGHTER,

10:48.949 --> 10:50.350
BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND HIM
FOR A WHILE?
(sighs, whispers) YEP.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.421
(normal voice) FORCEPS.

10:51.421 --> 10:54.354
(monitor beeping steadily)

10:54.354 --> 10:58.288
WOW, THIS WOUND
IS REALLY DEEP.

10:58.288 --> 11:00.130
TO GET GOOD MARGINS,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO--
I GOT IT.

11:02.332 --> 11:06.997
(keys jangling)
YOU ARE ONE SLEEPY GIRL.

11:06.997 --> 11:08.999
(lock clicks)
I'M GONNA GET YOU TO BED
RIGHT NOW. (grunts)

11:11.041 --> 11:12.903
(voice breaking) UM...

11:12.903 --> 11:14.444
I WAS GONNA GO TO A HOTEL.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.376
(sniffles) BUT MER SAID
I SHOULD COME HERE.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.810
WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
READ THOSE FIVE TEXT MESSAGES.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.011
(sobbing) I'M SORRY.

11:21.011 --> 11:24.214
I'M SORRY. SOFIA'S ASLEEP
IN ZOLA'S BED--

11:24.214 --> 11:26.016
AND I-I CAN MOVE HER. SHE--

11:26.016 --> 11:28.188
SHE PROBABLY WON'T WAKE UP.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.161
(sobbing continues)
YEAH, OKAY.

11:31.161 --> 11:32.362
(keys jangle)

11:32.362 --> 11:35.095
CATHERINE MAY BE RIGHT.
I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE

11:35.095 --> 11:38.368
I'M TOO CLOSE TO THIS
TO SEE IT CLEARLY.

11:38.368 --> 11:41.471
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE
SEEING THIS CLEARLY?

11:41.471 --> 11:43.703
(monitor beeping steadily)

11:43.703 --> 11:46.737
WELL, YANG WAS ADVOCATING FOR
A MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.739
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
WE GO WITH.

11:48.739 --> 11:52.012
CATHERINE'S REVIEWING
HIS CHART--

11:52.012 --> 11:54.344
LABS, I DON'T KNOW.

11:54.344 --> 11:56.446
IF SHE WANTS TO MAKE
THE DECISIONS,

11:56.446 --> 11:58.488
THEN MAYBE SHE SHOULD.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.423
(woman) HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.955
HEY, HOW IS SHE DOING?

12:04.955 --> 12:06.496
WELL, I-I PUT IN
THE CHEST TUBE.
(pen clicks)

12:06.496 --> 12:08.728
ONE OF HER BROKEN RIBS
SLICED INTO HER LUNG.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.160
SO, I MEAN, SHE PUT OUT
A LOT OF BLOOD.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.502
WE'RE WATCHING HER.
OKAY.

12:12.502 --> 12:13.864
HOW ARE YOU?
(exhales deeply)

12:13.864 --> 12:16.406
(scoffs) FABULOUS.

12:16.406 --> 12:18.408
YEAH.

12:18.408 --> 12:20.971
(telephone ringing in distance)
WHAT?

12:20.971 --> 12:22.242
NOTHING.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.515
WHAT?
I-I JUST...

12:25.515 --> 12:27.818
(chuckles)

12:27.818 --> 12:29.519
I WISH I HAD KNOWN
IT WAS GONNA BE

12:29.519 --> 12:32.082
THE LAST TIME
YOU AND I WERE TOGETHER.

12:32.082 --> 12:34.825
I WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

12:36.486 --> 12:38.458
WELL, WAS THE LAST TIME BAD?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.230
NO, THE LAST TIME
WAS WEDNESDAY,

12:40.230 --> 12:42.032
WHEN WE KNOCKED THAT PLATE
OFF THE COUNTER,

12:42.032 --> 12:44.294
AND I SPENT HALF THE NIGHT
PULLING SHARDS OF GLASS

12:44.294 --> 12:46.136
OUT OF YOUR FOOT.
THAT WAS NOT THE LAST TIME.

12:46.136 --> 12:47.197
YEAH.
IT WAS?

12:47.197 --> 12:49.399
MM-HMM. NOT OUR BEST WORK.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.541
(Laura Welsh's "Cold Front"
playing)

12:51.541 --> 12:52.903
WELL, THAT'S AWFUL.

12:52.903 --> 12:56.476
AFTER THE KIND OF RUN
WE HAD...

12:56.476 --> 12:58.208
IT'S JUST A SHAME.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.912

13:01.912 --> 13:03.053

13:27.107 --> 13:29.139
EVERYONE I LOVE EITHER
CHEATS ON ME OR DIES.

13:29.139 --> 13:30.911
CALLIE...

13:30.911 --> 13:34.184
OR CHEATS ON ME AND DIES.

13:34.184 --> 13:36.486
GEORGE DID BOTH.
ARIZONA'S NOT GONNA DIE.

13:36.486 --> 13:39.449
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
FEEL ANY BETTER.

13:39.449 --> 13:41.151
(glass clatters,
bottle scrapes table)

13:41.151 --> 13:45.395
(whiny voice) UGH. I'M SORRY.
I'M DRINKING ALL YOUR WINE.

13:45.395 --> 13:47.427
YOU SHOULD BE DRINKING
ALL YOUR WINE

13:47.427 --> 13:51.001
AFTER WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
TONIGHT WITH HEATHER AND...

13:51.001 --> 13:53.864
(clicks tongue, sobs)
AND RICHARD, OH, MY GOD!

13:53.864 --> 13:55.936
WHY IS EVERYTHING
SO HORRIBLE?

13:55.936 --> 13:58.238
PLEASE, IT'S OKAY.
GO AHEAD.
(sniffles)

13:58.238 --> 13:59.069
IT'S ALL YOURS.

13:59.069 --> 14:01.841
(sniffles) YEAH?

14:01.841 --> 14:04.374
YEAH. PLEASE.
OKAY.

14:06.376 --> 14:08.518
(gulping loudly)

14:12.352 --> 14:14.084
I'LL OPEN ANOTHER BOTTLE.

14:14.084 --> 14:15.285
JUST PAGE HER!

14:15.285 --> 14:16.426
I CAN'T PAGE SOMEONE 9-1-1

14:16.426 --> 14:18.058
WITHOUT THE NAME
OF THE PATIENT--
ANDREA.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.589
WHEN DR. TORRES CALLS IN,
SHE'LL EXPECT TO KNOW WHO--

14:19.589 --> 14:21.361
NO, THERE'S NO PATIENT.
JUST PAGE HER.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.593
WE CAN'T PAGE 9-1-1
WITHOUT A PATIENT EMERGENCY.
(sighs)

14:23.593 --> 14:26.166
LOOK AT ME. DOES IT LOOK LIKE
THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.167
HEY, HEY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.238
(pants)
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:28.238 --> 14:30.941
I NEED YOU TO PAGE CALLIE
9-1-1.
WHY?

14:30.941 --> 14:32.172
BECAUSE SHE TOOK OFF
WITH MY BABY,

14:32.172 --> 14:33.503
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE,

14:33.503 --> 14:35.105
AND WHEN I CALL HER,
SHE DOESN'T PICK UP.

14:35.105 --> 14:36.947
ALL RIGHT, DID SHE MAYBE--
NO, JUST DO IT!

14:36.947 --> 14:39.179
(cell phone beeps)

14:39.179 --> 14:41.351
SO WE WERE ABLE TO REMOVE
ALL OF THE NECROTIC TISSUE,

14:41.351 --> 14:43.283
BUT THE LABS SUGGEST

14:43.283 --> 14:46.386
THAT YOUR ORGANS
ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.918
WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU CAN DO?

14:47.918 --> 14:50.220
WELL, WE'RE GIVING YOU
SOME POWERFUL ANTIBIOTICS.

14:50.220 --> 14:54.224
AND WE'RE HOPING THAT
THAT STOPS THE PROCESS.

14:54.224 --> 14:57.427
BUT...
BUT I MIGHT NOT MAKE IT.

14:57.427 --> 15:00.500
WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN.

15:00.500 --> 15:05.235
BRI...

15:05.235 --> 15:06.236
WE WANT TO GET MARRIED NOW.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.308
RIGHT NOW.
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

15:08.308 --> 15:09.379
WE WANT TO BE MARRIED.

15:09.379 --> 15:11.381
WE NEED A CHAPLAIN.

15:11.381 --> 15:14.484
(telephone ringing in distance)

15:14.484 --> 15:17.117
(Bailey coos)
(high-pitched voice)
HEY, BAILEY.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.989
(normal voice)
ARIZONA IS IN THE LOBBY

15:18.989 --> 15:20.290
SCREAMING AT NURSES.

15:20.290 --> 15:23.193
WHY?
'CAUSE SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHERE CALLIE IS...

15:23.193 --> 15:24.494
OR THE BABY.

15:24.494 --> 15:27.027
OH, WELL, YOU NEED TO TELL HER
THEY'RE AT MY HOUSE.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.499
HA!
CALLIE'S NOT
A BATTERED WOMAN.

15:29.499 --> 15:31.631
WE'RE NOT HARBORING HER UNTIL
SHE GETS A RESTRAINING ORDER.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.033
SHE JUST WANTS SOME SPACE.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.164
BUT YOU DON'T THINK
ARIZONA'S CALLED HER,

15:34.164 --> 15:36.236
LIKE, 300 TIMES?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.968
IF CALLIE WANTED HER
TO KNOW WHERE SHE WAS,

15:37.968 --> 15:39.209
SHE'D HAVE--
SHE'D HAVE TOLD HER.

15:39.209 --> 15:40.340
YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
THAT ARIZONA

15:40.340 --> 15:41.571
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE
HER BABY IS?

15:41.571 --> 15:43.243
SHE'S SOFIA'S MOM, TOO.
THEY'RE BOTH OUR FRIENDS.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.644
YOU KNOW,
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE SIDES.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.547
IT'S NOT TAKING SIDES TO TELL
ARIZONA WHERE HER KID IS.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.180
OH, YOU THINK
THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA GO?

15:50.180 --> 15:51.351
MNH-MNH.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.984
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR?

15:55.125 --> 15:59.329
SHE WASN'T FUNNY FUNNY,
BUT SHE WAS WEIRD FUNNY.

15:59.329 --> 16:00.690
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT
TO HER MOM.

16:00.690 --> 16:02.132
HMM.

16:02.132 --> 16:03.433
(locker door opens)

16:03.433 --> 16:04.434
REMEMBER WHEN SHE SWALLOWED
THAT MARBLE?

16:04.434 --> 16:06.066
WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.668
HER MOM KNOWS SHE SWALLOWED
A MARBLE, IDIOT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.970
WHEN YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA,
YOU LET ME KNOW.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.272
YOU WERE HER ROOMMATE.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.344
HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE
A SINGLE NICE STORY ABOUT HER?

16:14.344 --> 16:17.447
SHE TOOK MY WHITE SWEATER
AND RETURNED IT PINK.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.079
SHE LEFT THE APARTMENT
WITHOUT WAKING ME UP

16:19.079 --> 16:21.711
WHEN WE BOTH HAD ROUNDS,
WHICH SHE KNEW ABOUT AND SAID,

16:21.711 --> 16:24.184
"I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.
YOU LOOKED SO PEACEFUL."

16:24.184 --> 16:25.385
SHE'D DRINK ALL THE MILK

16:25.385 --> 16:26.656
AND RETURN THE EMPTY CARTON
BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

16:26.656 --> 16:28.218
THEN WHY ARE YOU
ALL RED-EYED AND PUFFY?

16:28.218 --> 16:30.090
WE WEREN'T SOUL MATES.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.291
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I WANTED HER DEAD.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.194
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

16:34.194 --> 16:35.565
(sighs)

16:35.565 --> 16:39.269
(locker door opens)

16:40.400 --> 16:41.731
(indistinct conversations)

16:41.731 --> 16:44.174
(telephone ringing in distance)

16:44.174 --> 16:47.037
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
THE BABY?
OH, NOTHING. HE'S FINE.

16:47.037 --> 16:48.538
THEY HAVE HIM IN THE NURSERY.
OH. OH. I THOUGHT--

16:48.538 --> 16:50.180
I THOUGHT SOMETHING
HAPPENED.
NO, NO.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.612
I PAGED YOU BECAUSE
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

16:52.612 --> 16:57.016
THAT CALLIE AND SOFIA ARE GOING
TO STAY AT MY PLACE TONIGHT.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.119
I THINK SHE JUST NEEDS
SOME SPACE.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.420
SHE NEEDS TO COOL OFF.
AND... I KNOW

17:00.420 --> 17:02.122
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO
RUN OVER THERE OR ANYTHING,

17:02.122 --> 17:04.124
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

17:04.124 --> 17:06.456
THAT SHE AND THE BABY ARE--
ARIZONA.

17:06.456 --> 17:08.598
(elevator bell dings)
ARIZONA?!

17:10.460 --> 17:13.433
IS "I TOLD YOU SO"
INAPPROPRIATE?
SHUT IT.

17:14.764 --> 17:16.336
(thunder rumbling)

17:16.336 --> 17:19.669
COME ON. WHAT ABOUT...
HASSAN?

17:19.669 --> 17:21.271
HE'S OUT AT THE PILE, TOO?

17:21.271 --> 17:23.143
YOU REALIZE THEY CAN'T ALL BE
OUT AT THE DAMN PILE.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.614
NO, I DON'T CARE
WHAT RELIGION THEY ARE.

17:24.614 --> 17:27.447
JUST GIVE ME SOMEBODY--ANYBODY
THAT CAN OFFICIATE THIS--

17:27.447 --> 17:29.119
YEAH, AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD,
I'M GONNA SAY

17:29.119 --> 17:30.680
YOU WANT TO STAY AWAY
FROM PHRASES LIKE,

17:30.680 --> 17:32.722
"EVEN A CATHOLIC."

17:32.722 --> 17:34.654
YEAH.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.386
ALL RIGHT, UH,
JUST CALL ME BACK.

17:36.386 --> 17:37.827
(telephone receiver clatters)

17:37.827 --> 17:39.829
HOW IS RICHARD?

17:39.829 --> 17:42.532
HANGING BY A THREAD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:42.532 --> 17:44.134
YOU GONNA SCREAM AT ME,
TOO, NOW?

17:44.134 --> 17:45.335
I HEARD YOU ALREADY
HAD A GO AT HUNT AND BAILEY.

17:45.335 --> 17:47.137
I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME

17:47.137 --> 17:49.099
WAS GOING ON
THROUGH YOUR HEAD--
STOP!

17:49.099 --> 17:53.072
YOU ARE TERRIFIED.
I GET THAT.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.744
YOU LOVE HIM.

17:54.744 --> 17:56.276
AND YOU ARE AS SCARED
AS YOU HAVE EVER BEEN.
(clicks tongue and sighs)

17:56.276 --> 17:57.677
MARCHING
THROUGH THIS HOSPITAL

17:57.677 --> 17:59.179
TELLING EVERYBODY
THEY ARE INCOMPETENT

17:59.179 --> 18:00.250
IS NOT GONNA FIX
THAT SITUATION.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.212
(sighs)

18:02.212 --> 18:04.784
WE ARE ALL DOING OUR BEST.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.188
AND WE ARE GONNA
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.221
AND WE... ARE GONNA
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

18:11.221 --> 18:13.723
OKAY?

18:13.723 --> 18:16.396
OH.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.168
(sighs)

18:18.168 --> 18:19.529
AS SOON AS HE'S STABLE...

18:19.529 --> 18:22.402
YEAH.
AS SOON AS THE STORM PASSES,

18:22.402 --> 18:26.406
I'M GOING TO MOVE HIM
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL.

18:26.406 --> 18:30.780
(telephone ringing in distance)

18:30.780 --> 18:32.282
(woman over P.A.)
VISITOR CAROL ERDMAN,

18:32.282 --> 18:33.813
RETURN TO THE ADMIT DESK.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.186
VISITOR CAROL ERDMAN,
RETURN TO THE ADMIT DESK.

18:36.186 --> 18:38.618
I'M GONNA DO A THORACOTOMY
ON LYDIA.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.119
JUST WAITING FOR
AN O.R. TO OPEN UP.
(pen clicks)

18:40.119 --> 18:42.192
OKAY.

18:42.192 --> 18:44.324
(clears throat)

18:44.324 --> 18:46.896
SO THANKS FOR... BEFORE.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.159
"THANKS"?

18:49.159 --> 18:51.401
ARE YOU GONNA SEND A CARD
ON PRETTY STATIONERY?

18:51.401 --> 18:53.363
I'M JUST GLAD...
MM-HMM.

18:53.363 --> 18:56.166
THAT WE'VE GIVEN EACH OTHER
A BETTER LAST MEMORY.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.168
UH-HUH.

18:58.168 --> 18:59.639
(telephone ringing in distance)

18:59.639 --> 19:01.411
WHAT?

19:01.411 --> 19:04.314
I DON'T KNOW.

19:04.314 --> 19:05.745
IF WE'D REALLY
THOUGHT IT THROUGH,

19:05.745 --> 19:08.748
THEN FOR THE LAST TIME
WE'D HAVE--

19:08.748 --> 19:10.620
WHAT?

39:26.735 --> 39:27.936
YEAH.

39:27.936 --> 39:30.098
♪ I DIDN'T SEE AT ALL ♪

39:30.098 --> 39:32.941
(clattering)

39:32.941 --> 39:36.575
(sighs) ZOLA IS ASLEEP.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.976
ALL RIGHT, LITTLE MISS...
(grunts)

39:37.976 --> 39:39.107
IN FIVE MINUTES,
IT'S YOUR TURN.

39:39.107 --> 39:41.880
TO BE CLEAR, I AM HAPPY
TO DO THE DISHES,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.553
BUT THERE IS NO UNIVERSE
IN WHICH I GENERATE DINNER.

39:44.553 --> 39:46.715
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

39:46.715 --> 39:47.986
MAC AND CHEESE.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.658
(doorbell rings)
OH, NO, WE HAD THAT LAST NIGHT.

39:49.658 --> 39:51.460
WELL, AND IT WAS GOOD.
RIGHT? IT WAS GOOD.
(toys clatter)

39:51.460 --> 39:54.923
OH, THANK YOU.
(Zola speaks indistinctly)

39:54.923 --> 39:58.867
(voice breaking) HI. UM,
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER EVERYBODY.

39:58.867 --> 40:00.729
NO, IT'S OKAY.

40:00.729 --> 40:02.170
CAN I SEE HER
FOR JUST A MINUTE?

40:02.170 --> 40:04.002
YOU SAW HER THIS AFTERNOON.
YOU CAN GET HER TOMORROW NIGHT.

40:04.002 --> 40:08.907
I KNOW. UM... BUT COU--
YOU CAN SEE HER
WHEN IT'S YOUR NIGHT.

40:08.907 --> 40:12.010
I COULD, UH...
I COULD JUST TAKE HER ON THE--

40:12.010 --> 40:13.912
ON THE FRONT PORCH FOR A MINUTE,
AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE HER.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.185
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW CONFUSING THIS IS FOR HER?

40:17.185 --> 40:20.549
♪♪♪

40:20.549 --> 40:23.091
(sniffles)
YEAH, I REALIZE THAT.

40:23.091 --> 40:24.192
(toy clatters)
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:24.192 --> 40:25.454
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IN BED RIGHT NOW.

40:25.454 --> 40:26.595
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET HER TO SLEEP

40:26.595 --> 40:27.756
WITH YOU COMING AND GOING?
(Sofia fussing)

40:27.756 --> 40:29.498
FIVE MINUTES.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

40:29.498 --> 40:30.699
SHE SHOWS UP HERE
WITH THIS ACT,

40:30.699 --> 40:31.930
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA
TAKE HER SIDE?
CALLIE--

40:31.930 --> 40:33.201
IT'S AN ACT.
CALLIE, LOOK AT ME.

40:33.201 --> 40:34.963
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

40:34.963 --> 40:36.665
FIVE MINUTES.

40:38.667 --> 40:40.969
(Sofia continues fussing)
(high-pitched voice)
COME HERE, SOFIA.

40:40.969 --> 40:43.912
COME HERE, BABY. OKAY.
YEAH.

40:43.912 --> 40:46.945
WHEE! COME ON, BABY.
(Richard) WE JUST WANT
TO SURVIVE THE STORM.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.118
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
(babbles)

40:50.118 --> 40:56.725
WE PRAY, "PLEASE, GOD,
JUST GET ME TO THE OTHER SIDE."

40:56.725 --> 41:00.529
WE NEVER IMAGINE WHAT IT'LL
BE LIKE WHEN WE GET THERE.

41:00.529 --> 41:04.533
(whispers) I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

41:04.533 --> 41:07.936
(voice breaking)
AND I MISS YOU EVERY SECOND.

41:07.936 --> 41:10.038
(sniffles)
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY GIRL.

41:10.038 --> 41:14.903
WHAT IF WHEN THE STORM PASSES,
NOTHING'S LEFT?

41:14.903 --> 41:17.876
I ALWAYS SAID
I COULD HANDLE ANYTHING.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.808
I WAS WRONG.

41:19.808 --> 41:21.850
I WAS WRONG ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.852
I THINK THERE'S NO HARM
IN GETTING ANOTHER OPINION.

41:23.852 --> 41:25.213
WAS I OR WAS I NOT CORRECT?

41:25.213 --> 41:27.886
WHY DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL
SO THREATENED?

41:27.886 --> 41:30.919
YOU KNOW, I'M ANOTHER OPINION,
AND I HAVE TO TIP MY HAT.

41:30.919 --> 41:32.190
DR. BAILEY CALLED IT.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.623
NOBODY SAID IT WASN'T GOOD
TO DEAL WITH THE PANCREAS,

41:34.623 --> 41:36.995
BUT HE IS STILL CLEARLY
UNSTABLE.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.968
HE HASN'T REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS--
NONE OF THAT IS UNUSUAL.

41:39.968 --> 41:41.930
I WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN
ANOTHER PERSON--

41:41.930 --> 41:45.203
SOMEBODY THAT COULD TELL US--
I WILL MAKE THE DECISION.

41:45.203 --> 41:48.577
YOU'VE SAID WHAT YOU THINK,
AND THEN YOU SAID IT AGAIN.

41:48.577 --> 41:51.239
AND I WILL TAKE THAT
UNDER ADVISEMENT.
DR. GREY--

41:51.239 --> 41:52.781
HE PICKED YOU
TO BE HIS GIRLFRIEND.

41:52.781 --> 41:54.282
AND WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.

41:54.282 --> 41:56.214
BUT HE PICKED ME
TO BE HIS FAMILY.

41:56.214 --> 41:58.817
AND YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM THAT RESPONSIBILITY

41:58.817 --> 42:01.990
THE SECOND THAT--
NO ONE SAID I WOULD
BE GOOD AT IT.

42:01.990 --> 42:05.924
AND HE KNEW THAT.
BUT HE PICKED ME ANYWAY.

42:05.924 --> 42:08.557
I'M THE FAMILY.
MEREDITH.

42:08.557 --> 42:10.929
PLEASE, DON'T GET INVOLVED.

42:10.929 --> 42:14.933
BUT I WAS RIGHT ABOUT
ONE THING.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.765
HI.

42:16.765 --> 42:19.107
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
