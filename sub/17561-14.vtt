00:02.252 --> 00:05.213
Ooh, Val, did Vic get back
from the doctor's yet?

00:05.296 --> 00:06.923
Is his pelvis fixed?
Can he do it?

00:07.006 --> 00:09.092
Can he do it?
Can he do it?

00:09.175 --> 00:10.593
He hasn't even gone
to the doctor yet.

00:10.677 --> 00:14.013
I don't even know what time
his appointment is, 2:30.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.265
It is so exciting.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.599
Two people who have yearned

00:16.683 --> 00:18.476
for each other desperately

00:18.560 --> 00:19.811

00:19.894 --> 00:20.895
a broken pelvis.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.147
Hey, you're not wearing your

00:22.230 --> 00:23.815
granny panties, are you?

00:28.194 --> 00:30.155
All I want Vince to do
is acknowledge

00:30.238 --> 00:31.448
that Robyn is after him.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.074
Why can't he do that, Tina?

00:33.158 --> 00:35.118
Oh, my God
and why can't he trust me?

00:35.201 --> 00:37.912
- If he would just trust.
- Oh, my God, am I alive?

00:37.996 --> 00:41.374
'Cause I think
I was just bored to death.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.418
Who peed in your granola?

00:43.501 --> 00:45.170
I'm sorry, but you and Vince
have been on this

00:45.253 --> 00:47.422
like "thinking break"
for like two weeks now

00:47.505 --> 00:49.924
and it is driving me crazy.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.301
Why won't you
just talk to him?

00:51.384 --> 00:53.303
Because if we talk,
we're gonna break up.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.763
And I don't want to break up.
I love her.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.431
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, dude.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.974
You two have got to stop acting
like two little children.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.309
Just talk to her.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.810
You know what? You're right.
This is ridiculous.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.145
The two of us need to sit down

01:02.228 --> 01:03.480
and discuss our relationship.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.147
I mean, Holly's
never gonna respect me

01:05.230 --> 01:07.066
if I keep acting like a baby.

of my buddies from the station.

about 3:30 as he is?

- Two thirty.
- Two thirty.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.435
It's the time of my appointment.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.104
Okay, so, uh,
Marcus can I get you

02:26.187 --> 02:27.981
a cup of coffee or a muffin?

Wow, Vic, you got to bring

02:35.822 --> 02:37.240
your gorgeous wife
down to the station

02:37.323 --> 02:39.993
so the guys can see that
you have not been exaggerating.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.744
Oh, well, your muffin's free.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.539
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, I insist.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.916
Any friend of Vic's
that tells me I'm gorgeous

02:47.000 --> 02:48.668
gets a free muffin and a coffee.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.128
No, Val, really.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.839
I got three guys with me.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.385
Well, for all of them, okay?

for us every day.

The Fireman's Special.

Vince is thinking

what I'm wondering about?

03:31.753 --> 03:34.464
Oh, good God.
I'm going to get coffee.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.799
Vince loves coffee.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.968
He didn't start drinking coffee
till he was like 18

03:39.052 --> 03:41.262
but then he couldn't
stop drinking it.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.725
That was rude.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.269
I can't take it anymore.
She is such a dud.

He wants to come to the bakery

03:57.862 --> 03:59.739

Holly's not here?

03:59.822 --> 04:01.824

I know how stupid you are.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.168
What if we don't do

04:12.251 --> 04:13.461
such a good job of keeping them

04:13.544 --> 04:15.338
apart anymore?

04:15.421 --> 04:17.673
And they accidentally
run into each other.

but the guys were

08:20.958 --> 08:24.587

that you took it away.

I didn't give them free food?

they were more upset

was something like "curt."

09:43.666 --> 09:45.334
Alright, then.
You're a fire baby.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.003
Hmm?

09:47.086 --> 09:49.505
Fire baby, fire baby, fire baby.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.007
Okay, you know what?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.842
Suddenly I am not
in the mood for all of this.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.176
Oh, good.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.345
Well, then why don't you
go down to the fire station

09:56.429 --> 09:57.805
and sleep with your fire baby
brothers?

09:57.888 --> 09:59.765
Oh, okay.
You know what?

09:59.849 --> 10:00.850
Maybe I will.

10:00.933 --> 10:01.934
- Good.
- Good.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.102
Yeah. Oh, wait.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.896
- Baby want his ba-ba?
- Ohh.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.273
You know what,
I would ask you

10:07.356 --> 10:08.691
for the strawberries,
but I'm afraid.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.735
You'd charge me for them.
That's a burn.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.321
[instrumental music]

10:18.826 --> 10:20.578
So, is there anything
you could recollect

10:20.661 --> 10:21.620
about maybe how he looked?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.247
Five-ten and a half, 175

10:23.331 --> 10:26.042
dark hair with that fake black
dye job, knock-off jeans

10:26.125 --> 10:28.461
with very realistic wear holes.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.839
- Well, photographic memory?
- I couldn't tell.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.180
- Uh, relationship?
- Oh, he was a stranger.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.309
I mean you two guys.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.727
Uh..

10:44.810 --> 10:47.772
We're still thinking about that.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.232
See, Vince is working with his

10:50.316 --> 10:52.068
ex-girlfriend
who's totally after him.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.195
Holly, please don't
start this Robyn stuff again.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.696
Well, it's her fault
we got mugged.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.406
If she weren't in love with you
we never would have been

10:57.490 --> 10:59.742
on a thinking break and we never
would've been standing where--

10:59.825 --> 11:02.161
She's not in love with me.
She's my business partner.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.246
- She's done nothing but help.
- 'Oh, my God.'

11:04.330 --> 11:07.333
Okay, well, if that's what
you want to believe, then fine.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.211
But I know something
you don't know.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.712
- What do you know?
- I can't tell you.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.547
I promised Robyn
that I wouldn't tell.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.715
What are you talking about?

11:14.799 --> 11:15.925
If I tell you what I promised

11:16.008 --> 11:17.551
then I would be telling you.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.137
- Tell me.
- I can't.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.431
Can you tell me?

11:22.515 --> 11:26.852
Well, Robyn never said
that I couldn't tell you.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.773
- So, Robyn fired him. Remember?
- She had a--

11:30.856 --> 11:33.526
Remember how you were rehired
five minutes later?

11:33.609 --> 11:36.487
- Did you ever wonder why?
- Why?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.823
Because I went back that day

11:38.906 --> 11:42.785
to beg Robyn
to give you your job back.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.286
And instead

11:44.370 --> 11:46.414
I struck a deal with the devil.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.460
I suppose we could make a deal.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.171
Oh, you rock.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.965
Rockin' Robyn.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.883
Vince comes back if you never

11:57.967 --> 11:59.385
show up at work again.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.595
What's that, Rockin' Robyn?

12:01.679 --> 12:02.888
And if you do show up

12:02.972 --> 12:04.723
Vince will be fired.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.726
[laughs]

12:07.810 --> 12:10.104
Oh, my God, I knew it.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.897
You are trying
to steal my boyfriend.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.608
Wow, pretty and smart.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.237
Oh, my God.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.697
I know, right?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.991
I can't believe it.
Why didn't you ever tell me?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.827
Uh, she promised.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.454
That's it.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.663
I'm quitting.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.664
Quitting?
No.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.458
Vince, you don't have to quit

12:30.541 --> 12:32.001
just so long as you believe me.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.752
We can be on the same page
and we can deal with her.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.171
Holly, I can't
work with her now

12:35.254 --> 12:36.422
and I have to tell her that.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.424
And nobody threatens
my girlfriend like that.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.135
You said "girlfriend."
So we're not thinking anymore?

12:41.218 --> 12:42.511
Who are we kidding?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.847
We were never thinking.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.516
Aw, I'm really glad
this worked out for you guys

12:47.600 --> 12:52.188
'cause the chance of you getting
your stuff back is like zero.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.443
[instrumental music]

12:59.111 --> 13:01.197
Hey, Vin, what's up?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.990
Robyn, I'm gonna have to quit.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.492
Quit?
Why?

13:04.575 --> 13:06.994
You told Holly she can't
come see me at work.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.038
Yes, that's exactly what I said.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.875
Don't try to deny it, Robyn.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.627
What?

13:14.710 --> 13:16.003
I told her to stay away

13:16.086 --> 13:17.421
because it interfered
with your work

13:17.505 --> 13:19.089
and that
you would be distracted.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.508
- Yeah, well--
- You also said.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.260
That you were going after
my man.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.221
No, actually, I didn't.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.973
- You did.
- Twister.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.684
She's totally twisting
all the words.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.937
Twister.
Twister, twister.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.315
- Holly, stop.
- Twister.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.359
Vin, I'm sorry
if she misinterpreted

13:38.442 --> 13:41.403
what I said but I'm not
interested in you in that way.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.114
Oh, please.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.617
- Holly, can I just--
- Baby, we're talking.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.538
You love him.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.041
Vince, she's totally lying.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.502
Hey, sweetie.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.715
Guys, this is Jeff,
my boyfriend.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.343
- Your boyfriend?
- Your boyfriend?

14:04.426 --> 14:07.888
Okay, so now
all of a sudden

14:07.972 --> 14:09.431
you have a boyfriend?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.268
For two years.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.020
So, how come we have never
met him before?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.189
We like to separate
business and pleasure.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.901
I don't go to his office
and he doesn't come to mine.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.822
She's making this up.
He's an actor.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.783
I've seen him
in a deodorant commercial.

14:27.866 --> 14:30.077
- Holly--
- What?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.620
She's got a boyfriend.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.331
Wait, so you think
I'm making this up?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.125
You think I'm a liar?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.798
Oh, my God.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.341
Vin, look

14:44.425 --> 14:46.260
Daddy and I would love
for you to stay.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.387
So if you change your mind

14:48.470 --> 14:50.514
you know where to find me.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.391
Come on, baby.

14:56.895 --> 14:58.230
Alright, Fantastic 4.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.108
Back together again.
Ha ha.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.154
[cellphones ring]

15:08.532 --> 15:10.492
- Holly.
- Vince.

[indistinct chatter on TV]

15:39.355 --> 15:42.358
Baby, I am so sorry.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.568
I never should've walked out.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.447
I should've just stayed here
so the two of us

15:48.530 --> 15:51.533
could've talked about it..

15:51.617 --> 15:53.744
...laughed about it.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.206
[giggles]

16:01.877 --> 16:03.921
- Val?
- No.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.715
Lauren?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.927
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, you seemed so into it.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.554
Okay, where, where is Val
and what are you doing here?

16:12.638 --> 16:13.889
Well, after your big fight

16:13.972 --> 16:15.891
I came over here
to calm her down

16:15.974 --> 16:17.559
and eat your romantic dinner.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.895
Shrimp has a very small window.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.021
So where is she?

16:21.105 --> 16:22.272
At the firehouse.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.816
Thanks to me,
she's going down there

16:23.899 --> 16:26.568
to apologize to you.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.986
She did?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.947
You're welcome.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.743
Okay, Vic, we can't.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.747
She's my best friend.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.082
Your wife.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.375
We mustn't let our hearts

16:41.458 --> 16:43.335
get the better of our heads.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.545
You go your way.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.088
I'll go mine.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.551
Well, no one's ever slammed
the door before the sex.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.180
Nope.
His bunk's empty.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.933
Look how nice he makes it,
just like my mommy.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.104
Oh, uh, look
could you do me a favor?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.982
When you see him
just tell him to come home.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.358
Sure.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.277
Ugh, one more thing.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.613
Um, you and I are okay
about the whole

17:11.696 --> 17:12.865
Fireman's Special thing?

17:12.948 --> 17:14.616
Well, yes,
now that you explained it

17:14.700 --> 17:18.162
in a nice way
with polite words.

17:18.244 --> 17:20.329
Yeah, I would love to feed
the whole squad for free.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.374
- But I just can't afford to.
- Of course you can't.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.627
And I'll explain to the guys.
No more free food.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.337
You'll just give it to me.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.551
Hi.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.470
Hi.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.434
Perhaps you'd like some privacy?

17:40.517 --> 17:41.894
Yo, everybody up and out.
Let's go.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.228

need some alone time.

We got a man in need.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.153
I'll put a sign
on the door, bro.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.197
You know what I'm saying.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.793
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

18:05.876 --> 18:06.919
I don't want
to be right anymore.

I just want to be right here

in your arms.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.132
Good, because this is exactly

18:12.216 --> 18:15.928
where I want you to be.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.972
- Come on, let's go home.
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, why?

on the door

18:20.766 --> 18:24.144

18:24.228 --> 18:26.063
- Are you saying--
- Oh, I think you know.

What I'm saying.

our tax dollars are for.

You're serious.

in the morning, baby.

Okay, well..
Listen, just be careful, okay?

Be careful with your pelvis

and your feet and your legs

19:18.198 --> 19:19.366
and your arms and your head

19:19.449 --> 19:21.577
and your ears and your nose.

- Just be careful.
- Okay, alright.

wanted you to quit your job.

I just, I wanted you to believe
what I said about Robyn.

I want to believe you but--

19:41.305 --> 19:42.431
"But"? See?

19:42.514 --> 19:44.016
There's still questions
going on in your head

19:44.099 --> 19:45.934
and you should trust me 100%.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.352
Isn't it possible you're letting

19:47.436 --> 19:48.687
your imagination
run away with you?

19:48.770 --> 19:50.272
No.
She's lying.

She has a boyfriend.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.109
How many times do I have
to go through this with you?

19:54.192 --> 19:56.236

20:01.491 --> 20:03.243
Too long.

[sighs]

20:04.912 --> 20:06.288
Look..

20:06.371 --> 20:08.790
...I don't think
I can do this anymore.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.044
- Do what?
- This, us.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.545
Whenever we're together
I'm always gonna feel

20:13.629 --> 20:17.299
like you don't believe me
and I'll try to get past it

20:17.382 --> 20:20.010
and I'll try to let it go but..

20:20.093 --> 20:23.096
...I'm not gonna be able to.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.265
I don't know what to say.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.059
Maybe we should

20:27.142 --> 20:28.393
go back to thinking for a while.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.688
No. I think that we're done.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.108
- Done thinking?
- No.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.653
Just done.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.321
Ho-Holly..

20:45.869 --> 20:47.454
Oh, my damn.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.458
Hold me.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.422
