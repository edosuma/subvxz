00:51.330 --> 00:52.920
Did you hear that?

00:52.920 --> 00:55.290
Y-yes. Maybe
we should call the police.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.210
Psh! Police.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.750
Hand me my nine-iron.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.880
There's only one law
in this jungle.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.670
Mom's law.

01:08.380 --> 01:11.880
Marco? It's 3 a.m.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.290
Is it?

01:14.290 --> 01:16.500
Honey,
what are you doing up?

01:16.500 --> 01:17.710
Nothing.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.500
Barco Diaz, stop,
we're sad now.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.250
-Act sad.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.290
I'll take care of this.

01:27.290 --> 01:29.460
Maybe it's time

01:29.460 --> 01:31.290
-we take down
these decorations.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.250
Mom, that's too soon.

01:35.750 --> 01:36.920
I want it to be
like nothing's changed.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.710
Oh, honey,
I know this is hard.

01:39.710 --> 01:40.710
-Look, I--

01:40.710 --> 01:43.040
Raphael,
what are you doing?

01:43.040 --> 01:45.500
I was just going to call

01:45.500 --> 01:47.830
the Teen Sadness hotline.

01:47.830 --> 01:49.040
I told you.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.250
-I got this.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.460
Well, how does
your oatmeal taste?

01:54.460 --> 01:56.290
Like empty nothingness.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.790
Mom, can you
be addicted to crying?

01:59.830 --> 02:02.540
How about
some Captain Blanche's
Sugar Seeds?

02:02.540 --> 02:05.750
Star loved Sugar Seeds.

02:08.290 --> 02:09.710
I'll pour you a bowl.

02:09.710 --> 02:11.960
I tried, I can't even
find the box.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.710
They're in the cupboard
behind the dog food.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.120
I hid it so well.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.290
Behind the dog food, Diaz!

02:18.290 --> 02:20.920
Star would eat all of them.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.920
And now they're both gone!

02:22.920 --> 02:26.500
Its behind the dog food, Marco.
Stop being so dramatic.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.040
Why do you have
to be such a cute idiot!

02:31.170 --> 02:33.920
Oh, Marco, yuck!

02:33.920 --> 02:35.120
When was the last time you
washed this thing!

02:35.120 --> 02:37.540
Star!
We need to be quiet!

02:37.540 --> 02:40.500
We don't know
who might be listening.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.120
Sorry, Mom.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.670
Sorry.

02:44.670 --> 02:47.670
It's okay. Can you check
on the Commission?

02:47.670 --> 02:51.040
Yeah, they seem... okay.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.290
-Still in their stasis.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.040
Oh, looks like ol' Heckapoo
is gonna be an aunty!

02:59.040 --> 03:02.250
So how exactly are we going
to de

03:02.250 --> 03:04.000
Once we're at the sanctuary,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.330
the Well of Magic should
be able to rejuvenate them.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.330
And Lekmet's gonna
meet us there?

03:08.330 --> 03:11.420
Yes, he'll meet us there.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.120
Okay, great.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.580
So what's up
with that warnicorn?

03:15.580 --> 03:16.790
What?

03:22.580 --> 03:24.880
Mom!

03:24.880 --> 03:26.040
Mom, what is going on?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.380
Its the fritz!

03:27.380 --> 03:28.960
It's causing
all magic to...

03:28.960 --> 03:30.080
to weaken and...

03:32.880 --> 03:34.880
fade.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.710
It's okay,
we're all right,

03:36.710 --> 03:40.120
as long as we have
this magical path to guide us.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.710
I guess
we're setting up camp.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.120
I got this one, Mom.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.670
Stop!
It's corrupted!

03:54.670 --> 03:56.040
What? No, no, no, it's fine!
Don't worry about it.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.330
It does this all the time.
Glossaryck never cared.

03:58.330 --> 04:03.040
Glossaryck isn't here,
and, ugh, he's probably
not coming back.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.330
Wait. What do you mean?

04:04.330 --> 04:06.330
Toffee has Glossaryck,

04:06.330 --> 04:09.500
and your wand
seems tainted
by his magic as well.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.420
It's the same magic I saw
when I fought Ludo.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.330
Now let's start a fire,

04:14.330 --> 04:16.000
and we'll head
for the sanctuary
in the morning.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.670
There must be something
helpful in here.

04:18.670 --> 04:21.880
"I corn't wait
to see you again."

04:21.880 --> 04:25.460
Uh, did your father
pack this with nothing but--

04:26.290 --> 04:28.830
Ugh, no.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.920
What are you doing?

04:32.920 --> 04:34.880
Starting a fire. Duh.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.460
Did your father
teach you that?

04:36.460 --> 04:38.250
No, Marco did.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.920
Marco taught me a lot,
like how to mope, self-pity,

04:41.920 --> 04:44.120
ya know,
all the cool teen stuff,

04:44.120 --> 04:46.750
and now that's all I have.

04:46.750 --> 04:47.920
What-- Mom!

04:47.920 --> 04:49.790
Shh shh shh!

04:54.670 --> 04:56.000
It looks
like they're just scouts.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.250
We'll let them--

04:57.250 --> 05:00.040
Mom, check it out!

05:01.790 --> 05:02.880
Star! No!

05:02.880 --> 05:04.750
-Ugh! Fine!

05:09.380 --> 05:11.170
Stick blast!

05:11.170 --> 05:12.210
Yah!

05:12.210 --> 05:13.250
Star!

05:21.790 --> 05:23.120
Aah! I did it! I did it!

05:23.120 --> 05:25.040
Yeah! I did it!

05:25.040 --> 05:27.710
Star, we need to get
out of here immediately.

05:27.710 --> 05:29.460
I can't believe
you would be
so foolish as to--

05:32.540 --> 05:34.250
The High Commission!

05:49.920 --> 05:52.380
Where

05:52.380 --> 05:54.330
They're right there.

06:03.790 --> 06:05.790
Guess we're goin' up.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.540
Ugh, fine.

06:08.540 --> 06:12.750
Ugh, never listens
to her mother.

06:12.750 --> 06:16.170
C'mon, Mom!
What's the big deal?

06:16.170 --> 06:20.920
The big deal is
your recklessness has
put us in harm's way.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.290
It's just a little danger.

06:25.290 --> 06:27.540
I've been
in way worse than this.

06:27.540 --> 06:29.080
You know
what I'm talkin' about.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.330
Mmm! Mmm!

06:31.330 --> 06:32.830
Mmm mmm mmm!

06:32.830 --> 06:33.920
Mom!

06:36.120 --> 06:38.790
Are you okay?

06:38.790 --> 06:41.960
Let's just get
the Magical High Commission
and get out of here.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.040
Okay.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.120
The Sanctuary!

06:55.750 --> 06:58.540
Is it, like,
a little Sanctuary guardian?

06:58.540 --> 07:00.080
No, he's the gatekeeper.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.080
Wait, what?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.620
-Wah!
-Wah!

07:03.620 --> 07:04.880
-Rahh!
-Wahh!

07:04.880 --> 07:07.170
She's lost her marbles.

07:07.170 --> 07:08.920
Wah!

07:16.500 --> 07:18.790
Wah! Wah!

07:21.290 --> 07:22.830
Whoa.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.420
Whoa!

07:28.420 --> 07:30.790
-Look at all the Glossarycks.
-Yes, Star.

07:30.790 --> 07:33.540
The queens of Mewni
have been coming here
for generations.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.080
What now?

07:42.580 --> 07:44.120
All right. Let's get
the Commission

07:44.120 --> 07:45.790
into their pods
so we can revive them.

07:45.790 --> 07:46.830
Lets go, guys!

07:56.250 --> 07:58.330
All right, I'm going
to open the Wellspring.

07:58.330 --> 07:59.750
Stand clear.

08:04.540 --> 08:08.750
Is that stuff supposed
to be all black
and goopy like that?

08:08.750 --> 08:10.170
No, it's not!

08:15.080 --> 08:18.290
Oh, I feel like that's not
how its supposed to look.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.290
Its worse
than I'd feared.

08:21.290 --> 08:23.290
Mom?

08:23.290 --> 08:26.420
We'll have
to go with plan B.

08:26.420 --> 08:27.790
All right, plan B?

08:27.790 --> 08:29.500
What's plan B?

08:29.500 --> 08:32.120
We'll talk about that
after we get settled in.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.420
Look at you, you're
covered in scratches.

08:34.420 --> 08:35.830
Let's fix you up.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.380
What are you doing?!

08:39.380 --> 08:41.000
Star, what do
you want me to do?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.210
It's in tatters already.

08:44.830 --> 08:46.670
Uh, Mom?

08:46.670 --> 08:48.460
If the well is messed up,

08:48.460 --> 08:50.330
how are we going
to revive the Magic
High Commission?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.580
We don't need to worry about
that right now, Star.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.790
This sanctuary
is very well hidden.

08:54.790 --> 08:57.750
Now, do you want creamed corn
or corned cream?

08:57.750 --> 08:59.750
-To eat, Star.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.750
Generations of Butterflys have
come here in times of danger.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.920
We'll be safe
for as long as it takes.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.750
Now, do you have any change?

09:06.750 --> 09:08.580
So we're
just going to hide?

09:08.580 --> 09:09.750
That's your plan B?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.540
That's a terrible plan B!

09:11.540 --> 09:13.830
Your safety is
my priority right now.

09:13.830 --> 09:17.540
Uh, I didn't blow up
my whole life just
so you could give up!

09:17.540 --> 09:20.210
Come on, we could track
those rats back to Toffee

09:20.210 --> 09:21.790
and end this whole thing!

09:21.790 --> 09:23.960
Even if the Magical High
Commission was okay,

09:23.960 --> 09:26.170
we still wouldn't be strong
enough to defeat Toffee.

09:26.170 --> 09:29.790
Our best bet is
to lay low until
the situation changes.

09:29.790 --> 09:32.330
You lied to me.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.210
Star,
what are you doing?

09:34.210 --> 09:37.000
What else have
you lied about, Mom?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.920
I bet Lekmet isn't
even meeting us here!

09:38.920 --> 09:40.540
Lekmet is dead, Star.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.290
And it could
happen to us, too.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.500
Toffee won't stop
until he finds this!

09:45.960 --> 09:48.710
Did you take
that from my closet?

09:48.710 --> 09:50.750
And you're just
carrying it around?

09:50.750 --> 09:53.250
It's too dangerous
to do anything but stay.

09:53.250 --> 09:57.290
No! I am not hiding
here until I am old
and gray like you!

09:57.290 --> 09:59.750
This has
to mean something!

09:59.750 --> 10:00.920
No, Star!

10:00.920 --> 10:03.540
The wands are linked!
He'll find us!

10:03.540 --> 10:05.540
Oh, like he won't find us

10:05.540 --> 10:07.960
with you carrying
his finger around!

10:07.960 --> 10:10.880
I defeated him once,
I can do it again!

10:10.880 --> 10:12.670
Fantastic exit beam!

10:12.670 --> 10:14.080
Star, stop!

10:14.080 --> 10:17.380
Why? What happened
to cool warrior queen Mom?

10:17.380 --> 10:19.710
I was never
a cool warrior queen, Star.

10:19.710 --> 10:22.880
I was a happy-go-lucky
girl like you.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.290
And then Toffee and his monsters
killed my mother.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.000
I thought you sent
Grandma to a grandma farm

10:38.000 --> 10:40.670
to hang out
with other grandmas.

10:40.670 --> 10:42.500
Oh, Star.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.750
Tell me.

10:53.750 --> 10:56.620
I was about your age
when it happened.

10:56.620 --> 11:00.880
I didn't know what to do,
so I spoke to Eclypsa.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.000
Eclypsa Eclypsa?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.710
But she's been dead
for hundreds of years!

11:06.710 --> 11:09.750
No, Eclypsa's alive.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.580
And I made
a deal with her.
