WEBVTT

01:09.069 --> 01:11.489
Oh.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.284
You were dreaming.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.745
You said Mom's name.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.749
Did I?

01:21.791 --> 01:24.168
Do you remember
what it was about?

01:25.836 --> 01:28.047
Not really.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.841
You were out super late
last night.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.803
I was working.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.222
Where'd you go yesterday?

01:38.098 --> 01:40.142
Drove around.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.314
Oh, I need coffee.

01:45.356 --> 01:48.359
What was your mom's
funeral like?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.987
I don't know.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.656
I wasn't there.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.032
You didn't go?

01:55.074 --> 01:57.409
No. I was at MacLaren.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.828
They wouldn't let me go.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.412
You missed
your mother's funeral?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.081
There really wasn't one.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.501
There was no money,
no other family.

02:05.543 --> 02:08.546
The county took care of it.

02:08.587 --> 02:11.507
Took me a while to find out
what they did with her.

02:11.549 --> 02:16.095
After I got home
from the first Gulf War, I...

02:16.136 --> 02:18.722
looked into it.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.767
Finally found her.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.103
An unmarked grave.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.522
That's awful.

02:26.564 --> 02:29.316
Well...

02:29.358 --> 02:31.402
you know, Mads,

02:31.443 --> 02:33.612
I've come to believe

02:33.654 --> 02:36.323
that it really doesn't matter
where you end up.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.619
Under a fancy stone or...

02:40.661 --> 02:42.997
somewhere out in the desert.

02:43.038 --> 02:46.792
It's all sacred ground.

02:46.834 --> 02:51.213
So long as your people know
where you are.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.260
You working today?

02:56.302 --> 02:59.513
Yeah, task force isn't over.

02:59.555 --> 03:03.809
But I've got a briefing
this morning on your mom's case.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.353
-Can I come with you for that?
-No.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.898
No, you can't, Mads,
and you know that.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.317
It's just a phone call anyway.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.195
I want to do something.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.908
I feel so useless.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.955
I know.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.832
I felt it, too.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.252
Still do.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.934
You left this at your mom's.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.523
- -

04:32.564 --> 04:33.774
- -

04:37.987 --> 04:39.238
- -

05:01.301 --> 05:03.762
Let's go this way.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.933
Set it up here.
That's good.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.353
We should've done this two hours
ago when it was still dark.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.355
I would've missed out
on that breakfast burrito.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.441
Get serious, Frankie.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.860
There are people out there
that want to tear you to pieces,

05:17.901 --> 05:20.320
one piece at a time.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.989
Yeah, well,
you need a sense of humor

05:22.031 --> 05:24.283
when your life is
totally fucked,

05:24.324 --> 05:26.702
and your department
isn't gonna protect you.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.287
Hey.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.248
What the fuck do you think
we're doing here

05:35.210 --> 05:37.588
All right, let's go.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.278
Get down.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.571
And stay down.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.032
Let's go.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.995
I'll go check in with Jimmy.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.914
I got her.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.624
ETA on O'Shea?

06:13.665 --> 06:15.417
1000.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.044
She better have something good.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.046
-Sheehan?
-Back door.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.631
Garwood and Rooker took him.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.675
-Smooth move.
-Yeah, I thought so.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.640
Eddie Vang, 29,
tight with Jai Lee,

06:29.681 --> 06:31.350
the guy I took down last night.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.227
We think this is the second man.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.853
Shooter had long hair.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.899
Surveillance video,
across from Farmers Market.

06:38.941 --> 06:42.361
They're both local
gangsters with Chinese OC ties.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.280
-Triads here or back there?
-One and the same.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.865
Chen's triad.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.867
We're on this, Bosch.
We'll find him.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.204
Once we get him, you can ask him
all about Shiwei Chen yourself.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.789
I'll be in touch.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.751
Asshole's probably halfway
to Hong Kong by now.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.212
Or laying low until he gets out.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.464
The D.A. is in the house.

07:02.506 --> 07:05.217
It's the standard proffer,
Sergeant.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.594
If you give us information
that leads

07:07.636 --> 07:09.221
to a prosecution in the murder

07:09.263 --> 07:11.557
of Howard Elias,
we'll take care of you.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.308
But you don't say how.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.144
This don't guarantee shit.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.688
There are no guarantees,
not at this stage.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.648
We might need your testimony,

07:19.690 --> 07:22.276
and we're not cutting a deal
until after that happens.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.446
You sure you don't want
to talk to a lawyer?

07:26.488 --> 07:29.741
Lincoln, sign the deal
on the waiver, or I'm gonna

07:29.783 --> 07:31.994
take your ass back to MDC.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.872
I want to see my daughter.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.208
That can be arranged. After.

07:41.253 --> 07:44.965
I'm not taking the fucking fall
for this.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.022
Ask your questions.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.941
You said you had a video
from the Black Guardian case.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.902
Who'd you give it to?

08:05.944 --> 08:08.280
Bradley Walker.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.490
Walker?

08:10.532 --> 08:12.451
You heard me.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.328
Bradley fucking Walker.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.206
Holy shit.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.458
All right, let's-let's hear it.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.585
You're suggesting
that the president

08:21.627 --> 08:23.754
of the police commission
murdered Howard Elias?

08:23.795 --> 08:26.006
I'm not suggesting anything.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.841
Why'd you give the video
to Walker?

08:27.883 --> 08:29.718
We had a deal.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.638
He and Elias had
their own thing.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.474
Walker would help him
settle cases.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.017
With insider information
from you?

08:37.059 --> 08:40.479
I'd tell Walker
what I knew about a case,

08:40.520 --> 08:42.606
he'd turn around
and give it to Elias.

08:42.648 --> 08:46.860
And Elias kicked back
a percentage of the settlement?

08:46.902 --> 08:49.571
And Walker took care of me.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.950
How many cases?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.868
Four. Five.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.788
The last two
I put away for Sydney.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.374
This one was gonna be it for me.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.875
Why is that?

09:01.917 --> 09:04.336
Because everybody was gonna
get rich off of this one.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.923
The city would have paid
millions to settle this case

09:07.965 --> 09:09.591
and bury the proof.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.343
So what happened?

09:11.385 --> 09:13.929
Why'd Elias turn down
the big payday?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.722
He got religion.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.059
Like his mistress said.

09:19.101 --> 09:21.520
Decided it was too important
to bury.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.314
Go to trial,

09:24.356 --> 09:28.360
make sure the world knew exactly
what they did to Harris.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.153
I mean, the man's been saying
for years

09:30.195 --> 09:33.282
All right.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.575
To get the video into court,
he'd have to authenticate it.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.578
He was gonna expose Walker
as the source.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.164
Which would ruin him.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.293
Walker had no choice.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.545
He had Elias killed.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.463
Wrong.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.882
How so?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.594
He did it himself.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.892
He told me
that's how you handle betrayal.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.938
Face to face.

10:04.980 --> 10:09.735
And he said
that if he went down for it,

10:09.776 --> 10:12.738
I was going down with him.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.742
So you framed Sheehan
for Walker.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.202
I saw the video.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.080
I saw what Sheehan did.
Him and Drake.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.960
Yeah, I switched the bullets.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.047
Fuck Frank Sheehan.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.923
Better him than me.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.844
What'd you do with the bullet

10:35.886 --> 10:38.055
you lifted
from the Elias autopsy?

10:41.433 --> 10:43.643
Tossed it in the gutter
at Cal State.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.523
After I switched it.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.609
Fuck me.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.860
There's no evidence that

10:51.902 --> 10:54.237
anything you just told us
is true.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.531
We have her financials.
Several sizable deposits--

10:56.573 --> 10:57.991
origin unknown.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.160
Unless those checks have
Walker's name on them,

11:00.202 --> 11:02.496
you don't have shit.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.664
My office can't go forward
without evidence.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.958
You don't have it.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.211
No gun, no video, no charges.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.381
-And Lincoln? -She looks good
for any number of crimes.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.218
Let my office know
if things change.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.600
So what now?

11:28.897 --> 11:31.066
Now we, uh, start over.

11:31.108 --> 11:34.152
Look for any links between
Lincoln, Walker and Elias.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.987
Anything that backs up
her story.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.031
Why don't we just do
a pretext call

11:38.073 --> 11:39.825
and nail Walker
with his own words?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.827
Good luck getting that
up and running

11:41.868 --> 11:43.703
before Walker finds out
Lincoln's in lockdown.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.622
Yeah, we don't have that kind
of time. We've got the weekend

11:45.664 --> 11:47.207
and then we have to charge her.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.792
-What about a poly?
-It's not worth a damn in court,

11:48.834 --> 11:50.919
but it might help convince
O'Shea.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.796
Go ahead, set it up.

11:52.838 --> 11:55.048
We got to find that video,
if it really exists.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.634
And get fresh warrants
for Elias' office and apartment.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.635
We weren't looking
for a microchip

11:58.677 --> 11:59.636
when we searched before.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.054
Okay, do it.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.681
But coordinate with
the special master, okay?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.892
Don't cross any lines.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.312
So that leaves Walker.
We got to run him down.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.355
We got to see if he's got
any alibi

12:10.397 --> 12:11.690
for the night of the killing.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.817
But we got to be discreet.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.527
I got Walker.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.029
According to
his driver's stolen gun report,

12:18.071 --> 12:21.533
Walker was at the Biltmore
Friday night-- fund-raiser.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.368
Good to know, thanks.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.579
Okay, let's do it.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.997
All right,
next time we call O'Shea,

12:27.038 --> 12:29.249
we bring him
a prosecutable case.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.210
Bosch, my office.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.267
I thought you would be thrilled

12:47.309 --> 12:49.519
that Lincoln put the finger
on Bradley Walker.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.937
I'm his alibi.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.525
Night of the killing, I was
watching him at his fund-raiser.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.611
He saw me there, engaged me.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.405
He was using me
in case he needed an alibi.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.574
Jesus Christ.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.202
Did you have eyes on him
the entire time?

13:05.243 --> 13:07.662
Just about.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.830
A male transporting
a female custody solo

13:50.872 --> 13:52.874
is frowned upon
in the department.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.127
It's frowned upon heavily.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.921
Who's gonna write me up

13:57.963 --> 13:59.464
Just saying.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.466
Must be a purpose to it.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.343
You didn't move the needle
in the interview.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.345
No checkable facts.

14:05.387 --> 14:08.682
Nobody believes you
about Walker.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.184
You need to figure out
how you could help us out,

14:11.226 --> 14:14.479
or Walker skates
and leaves you to take the fall.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.480
Come on, what have you got?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.691
I don't have shit.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.943
He's too smart.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.075
You missed the turn for MDC.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.327
Piper Tech.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.957
Good.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.876
I'll take a poly.

14:36.918 --> 14:40.297
Every fucking thing I said
was true.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.277
Bosch.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.404
It's Bennett. Bad news.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.114
How's that?

15:06.156 --> 15:09.534
Our River Watch suspect
got swept up by ICE yesterday.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.953
By the time word got to us...

15:11.995 --> 15:14.164
Known felon, rapid deportation.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.583
They shipped him
across the border. Gone.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.419
-Swept up where?
-Downtown.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.838
That new high-rise going up
across from the Biltmore.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.506
The Walker Grand.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.966
Yeah, I think that's it.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.052
Harry...

15:28.386 --> 15:30.680
Thanks for the update.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.182
It sucks, I know.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.933
I'm sorry.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.523
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Elias?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.901
I heard you let him go.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.402
Sheehan.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.447
We want the real killer,
and so do you.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.491
It wasn't Frank Sheehan.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.536
Well, you inspire confidence,

15:53.578 --> 15:54.954
which I can't say
about everybody else

15:54.996 --> 15:56.915
associated with the case.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.876
How so?

15:59.918 --> 16:02.796
I'm dealing with
the medical examiner's office.

16:04.589 --> 16:05.882
They gave me this.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.593
The things that were on his body

16:08.635 --> 16:10.679
and not collected
at the crime scene.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.057
Why are you showing me this?

16:14.099 --> 16:16.476
He didn't wear a wedding band,
Detective.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.061
He wore no jewelry.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.146
Which makes me wonder--
if they can mix things up

16:20.188 --> 16:22.982
at the M.E.'s office,
what about at the crime lab?

16:23.024 --> 16:26.736
First they said
the bullets that killed Howard

16:26.778 --> 16:27.821
matched Sheehan's gun.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.407
Then they said they didn't,

16:30.448 --> 16:34.119
which is why I came to you with
this instead of going to them.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.621
I appreciate that.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.457
And I give you my word
I will look into this.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.926
What is it, Detective?

16:49.968 --> 16:52.804
We're looking for something else
your husband had, Mrs. Elias.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.306
Uh, a video.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.933
On a micro SD card.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.518
A video
your husband believed would

16:58.560 --> 17:01.271
break the Black Guardian case
wide open.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.898
I don't know anything about it.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.318
I'd like to come back
to your house

17:07.360 --> 17:09.112
and search his home office,

17:09.154 --> 17:11.072
but with the media all over us,

17:11.114 --> 17:14.284
I don't want to do something
that could be misconstrued.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.203
I tell you what, Detective,
I'll look for your card.

17:17.245 --> 17:20.665
-But I doubt it's at the house.
-Why not?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.960
If it was something
that important to the case,

17:24.002 --> 17:26.379
Howard would have kept it close.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.721
Thank you, Mrs. Elias.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.940
Hey.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.984
Where is everybody?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.989
Uh, Pierce went to Judge Wexler
with the warrants,

17:53.031 --> 17:55.116
Edgar took Lincoln
back downtown,

17:55.158 --> 17:57.535
and Robertson said he had
something to do.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.662
Alone.

18:04.209 --> 18:07.253
What are you looking at?

18:07.295 --> 18:12.008
Coroner gave Elias's personal
effects to his wife,

18:12.050 --> 18:15.678
but she says he never wore
a wedding ring.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.850
Maybe it was something
he wore for court--

18:20.892 --> 18:23.019
you know, make the jurors
believe he's a family man?

18:23.061 --> 18:25.271
He wasn't in court
when he got shot.

18:25.313 --> 18:29.442
-Hidden compartment?
-Solid metal.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.694
Book it as received
by the victim's wife,

18:31.736 --> 18:33.905
and we'll circle back to it.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.949
I got to go.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.879
You know, Snyder,
what Lincoln did

18:49.921 --> 18:52.006
doesn't have anything
to do with you.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.427
Bullshit.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.035
Is he still here?

19:21.077 --> 19:23.371
What the fuck
you doing here, Jimmy?

19:23.413 --> 19:25.999
Don't be a dick, Rooker.
I need to talk to him.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.626
Alone.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.801
Well, Rook's separated,
just like me.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.345
What's that say about us cops

19:39.387 --> 19:42.599
Some cops.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.268
Took his sons up to Modesto.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.688
No kids, no need
for a fucking pool, right?

19:49.981 --> 19:53.318
My heart's bleeding.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.445
What do you want, Jimmy?

19:55.486 --> 19:58.114
Some clarity.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.283
We found the video.

20:00.325 --> 20:03.077
You're gonna have to tell me
what video you're talking about.

20:03.119 --> 20:07.749
The one from the hidden camera
in the junkyard bathroom.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.209
You didn't need the video.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.378
I told Bosch all about it.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.214
I'm not running from it, Jimmy.
I just...

20:15.256 --> 20:17.842
just fucked up.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.137
When you talked to Bosch,

20:21.179 --> 20:23.264
you left out some details,
didn't you?

20:25.642 --> 20:27.101
It would have taken
at least two men

20:27.143 --> 20:30.313
to hold Harris down, Frank.

20:30.355 --> 20:34.192
You and Terry Drake.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.529
He's on the video.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.200
I told Bosch what I did,
end of story.

20:44.202 --> 20:48.581
I may be a lot of things, Jimmy,
I am not a rat.

20:48.623 --> 20:53.086
You got the video...
it doesn't matter, does it?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.882
Terry's on his own.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.343
Does that clarify things
for you?

21:02.804 --> 21:05.014
Yes.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.228
It does.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.323
-Harry, what a surprise.
-Phil.

21:22.365 --> 21:25.910
Uh, I-I don't think
Maddie's here. Uh, Becca?

21:25.952 --> 21:28.371
No, no, I-I-I'm not here for
Maddie. I need to talk to you.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.082
About Becca covering
for Maddie skipping school

21:31.124 --> 21:32.417
to go to Borrego?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.544
No, I'm working a case.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.838
Oh, cool.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.424
Um, come on in.

21:42.802 --> 21:47.682
Sorry, it's, uh, it's probably
a little pungent out here.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.101
I just did five miles.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.854
So...

21:52.895 --> 21:55.148
so what are you doing here,
Harry?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.150
You gonna read me my rights?

21:57.191 --> 22:00.028
$50 million.

22:00.069 --> 22:03.072
I don't understand.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.158
Last Friday at the Biltmore bar,

22:05.199 --> 22:07.493
you said Bradley Walker took
a loan through your bank

22:07.535 --> 22:09.495
for $50 million
and wasn't paying it back.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.792
Harry, listen to me,
I-I-I was drinking,

22:14.834 --> 22:17.295
and I was pissed because
I paid a thousand bucks

22:17.336 --> 22:20.548
to be at that thing,
and some asshole took my spot.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.717
Please forget that I ever
told you any of that.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.594
It could be my job
if it got out.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.054
It'd be my whole fucking career.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.764
Okay, Phil, truth be known,

22:27.805 --> 22:30.433
I was the asshole
who took your spot.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.269
I needed to get in
'cause Walker was there.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.229
You're investigating Walker?

22:35.271 --> 22:36.564
Wait a minute, you're homicide.
What does this have to do

22:36.606 --> 22:38.399
with his $50 million debt?

22:38.441 --> 22:40.568
I can't tell you
what I can't tell you,

22:40.610 --> 22:42.612
but I need to know everything
there is to know

22:42.653 --> 22:44.405
about his business
and his money.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.240
Now, if you can help me,
I can help you.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.493
I can keep your name out
of the police reports.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.829
Like the way you took care
of my speeding ticket last year?

22:51.871 --> 22:55.541
Look, Phil, I'm sorry
about that, I am.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.752
Are you gonna help me or not?

22:57.794 --> 23:00.797
Yeah, of course.
You know...

23:00.838 --> 23:03.174
Did you accept money
from Bradley Walker

23:03.216 --> 23:06.552
in exchange for information
from IA investigations?

23:06.594 --> 23:08.513
Yes.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.307
Did Walker tell you that
he shared this information

23:11.349 --> 23:13.726
with Howard Elias?

23:13.768 --> 23:15.353
Yes.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.314
Did you find a video
depicting the events

23:18.356 --> 23:19.565
in the Black Guardian case?

23:19.607 --> 23:22.485
Yes.

23:22.527 --> 23:25.988
And did you give that video
to Bradley Walker?

23:27.990 --> 23:30.118
Yes.

23:30.159 --> 23:34.789
Is it true you did not shoot
Howard Elias?

23:34.831 --> 23:36.040
Yes.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.251
Did Bradley Walker tell you

23:38.292 --> 23:40.211
that he shot Howard Elias?

23:40.253 --> 23:43.381
Yes.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.052
We expect a thousand people,

23:48.094 --> 23:50.721
and there's not enough room
for that many people here.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.932
And second, our protest is
against the police,

23:52.974 --> 23:57.103
and you've moved us too far away
from the police station.

23:57.145 --> 23:59.313
-It's two blocks away.
-Come on, two of my guys

23:59.355 --> 24:01.732
get attacked
by someone in your group?

24:01.774 --> 24:02.984
It changes the ground rules.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.443
We respect your
First Amendment rights,

24:04.485 --> 24:06.070
but we have to take into account
public safety

24:06.112 --> 24:07.530
and the safety of our officers.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.240
-It wasn't one of us.
-It doesn't matter.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.992
It came from your crowd.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.828
-Your crow...
-What do you mean "your crowd"?

24:13.870 --> 24:16.289
-Oh, my God.
-Someone using your group

24:16.330 --> 24:18.416
as camouflage, okay?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.002
We're not going to allow you
to rally in front of the station

24:21.043 --> 24:24.213
where our officers and our
vehicles can be targets.

24:24.255 --> 24:27.049
I mean, look at this.
All these bars and fences.

24:27.091 --> 24:30.386
It's like an outdoor prison.
It's like you want us caged.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.472
Look, we can pull the permit
if you don't agree.

24:33.514 --> 24:34.974
Oh, wow.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.685
Where's Ms. Zealy? Maybe
we should be talking to her.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.145
She's no longer a part of this.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.731
-Why not?
-Look, this is a street rally.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.983
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. -It's gonna be
held on the street. -Yeah.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.449
How about Homewood and Wilcox?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.784
Where your drummers are.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.953
It's a half a block
from the station.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.205
We'll close off
the intersection.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.748
You guys can yell at us

24:58.789 --> 25:00.708
as long and as loud as you want.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.093
Bosch.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.803
Are you working today,
Detective?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.430
-Of course.
-My office.

25:14.472 --> 25:15.681
As soon as you can get here.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.642
I'm kind of mid-city, Chief...

25:17.683 --> 25:19.685
Chief?

26:00.935 --> 26:03.771
Thank you, Ida.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.199
The district attorney's
informed me

26:15.241 --> 26:17.785
that Sergeant Lincoln's
big reveal was Bradley Walker

26:17.827 --> 26:21.497
and that you are proceeding
with him as a suspect,

26:21.539 --> 26:23.416
even though she provided
zero evidence of her allegation.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.418
How most cases start.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.545
We're trying
to confirm or clear.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.214
I'd like to know why I had to
hear this from the D.A. instead

26:30.256 --> 26:32.842
of the detective I handpicked
to head my task force.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.760
Fast-moving case.

26:34.802 --> 26:36.762
Information comes in,
we have to move on it.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.265
You want me to work or spend
my time down here with you?

26:39.307 --> 26:44.270
I want to be informed of what's
going on in my own department.

26:44.312 --> 26:47.356
And I'm concerned about you
and your obsession with Walker.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.400
I didn't bring him into this--
Lincoln did.

26:49.442 --> 26:52.236
But I told you about him
three months ago.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.822
So are you upset with me
or yourself?

26:54.864 --> 26:57.325
-Yeah, what's that supposed to
mean? -Somebody tipped Walker

26:57.366 --> 27:00.786
that RHD identified a suspect
in the River Watch arson.

27:00.828 --> 27:03.622
That suspect
was suddenly deported

27:03.664 --> 27:06.167
before RHD could grab him up.

27:08.169 --> 27:11.756
Are you suggesting that I tipped
Walker to that suspect?

27:11.797 --> 27:14.759
All I'm saying is, you didn't
believe me three months ago.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.635
Maybe now you're starting to.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.388
You'd better be right, Bosch.

27:19.430 --> 27:22.600
"Beyond a reasonable doubt"
right.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.394
Yes, sir.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.752
Fuck.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.641
After we get out of here
tonight,

28:03.682 --> 28:05.643
what do you say
we go grab a cold one?

28:05.684 --> 28:07.520
Why would we do that?

28:07.561 --> 28:09.605
Because I know
what you're going through.

28:09.647 --> 28:12.858
Thinking you know your partner,
when you really don't know shit.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.402
I've been there, too.

28:18.114 --> 28:20.449
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:21.492 --> 28:23.661
Who wants to go first?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.497
I put Lincoln on the box.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.165
No deception. Story holds up.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.334
Okay, good for O'Shea to have.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.586
I went to see Sheehan.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.755
Bluffed him,
told him we found the video

28:34.797 --> 28:36.841
and that he and Drake were on it

28:36.882 --> 28:38.467
in the bathroom with Harris.

28:38.509 --> 28:41.470
Sheehan confirmed
with just another confirmation

28:41.512 --> 28:42.972
of Lincoln's story.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.974
Good.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.976
You get back into Elias' office?

28:47.017 --> 28:49.645
I did. No microchip, no video.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.480
I'm gonna hit his apartment
tonight.

28:51.522 --> 28:52.857
But could use help.

28:52.898 --> 28:53.774
I'm in.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.443
What about you, Snyder?

28:55.484 --> 28:58.863
I've been matching dates
of cash deposits Gabby made

28:58.904 --> 29:00.865
with the other three cases
she said

29:00.906 --> 29:02.324
she gave Walker information on.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.784
It's lining up.

29:03.826 --> 29:06.036
-And what about Walker?
-Oh, Walker's got

29:06.078 --> 29:08.038
a $50 million construction loan.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.290
He's leveraged
up to his eyeballs,

29:09.331 --> 29:11.459
and he's been missing payments.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.461
And every time my source's bank

29:13.502 --> 29:15.421
is about to move
into receivership,

29:15.463 --> 29:16.338
he coughs up the cash.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.590
Source unknown.

29:17.631 --> 29:18.966
He's been promising the bank

29:19.008 --> 29:20.843
a seven-figure payment
for a month.

29:20.885 --> 29:23.804
Counting on a cut of the Black
Guardian settlement from Elias.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.181
Is that motive?

29:25.222 --> 29:26.891
Reverse motive, you ask me.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.560
I mean, why kill the goose
keeping him out of receivership?

29:29.602 --> 29:31.562
Because he's desperate
and angry,

29:31.604 --> 29:34.148
and you don't cross
Bradley Walker.

29:34.190 --> 29:37.359
The motive is psychological,
not financial.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.653
This wasn't about the money.

29:39.695 --> 29:42.281
This is about manipulation

29:42.323 --> 29:43.741
and abuse of power.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.743
Did you look
into Walker's alibi?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.161
No, he was
definitely at the fund-raiser.

29:47.203 --> 29:50.498
250 witnesses can confirm that.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.667
Biltmore is, what,
four blocks from Angels Flight?

29:53.709 --> 29:57.087
Could he have slipped out,
hit Elias, and slipped back in?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.840
I'm gonna go down to the hotel
and check their security cams

29:59.882 --> 30:02.718
-and see.
-

30:07.348 --> 30:08.891
Hey.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.519
Harry. You, uh,
got a couple visitors.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.146
-I put 'em in the lieutenant's
office. -Who?

30:14.188 --> 30:17.858
One of them says he's a cop
or something, from China.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.778
Brought a translator with him.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.905
Okay.

30:22.947 --> 30:24.114
Keep grinding.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.658
Jerry.

30:25.699 --> 30:26.909
Yeah.

30:33.749 --> 30:37.336
We are collecting money

30:37.378 --> 30:40.548
to send pizza to those drummers.

30:40.589 --> 30:43.092
I figure they got to stop
drumming if they're eating.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.301
I'm in.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.512
-Fuck yeah.
-Come on.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.534
Card's in English on one side.

31:08.576 --> 31:09.785
You speak English.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.542
I will be outside.

31:22.423 --> 31:24.174
So what is the Ministry
of State Security?

31:24.216 --> 31:26.468
Is that, like,
the secret police?

31:26.510 --> 31:28.762
A special branch
of the Chinese government.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.389
I'll bet.

31:30.431 --> 31:31.974
What's your business here?

31:32.016 --> 31:35.394
My condolences
on the death of Eleanor Wish.

31:35.436 --> 31:39.607
I'm here to exchange information
and help you find her killers.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.899
That's the FBI's case.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.860
You should be talking to them,
not me.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.195
Do you have the identification
of the killers?

31:45.237 --> 31:47.156
Do you?

31:47.197 --> 31:49.450
Do you have contact
with Reggie Woo?

31:51.035 --> 31:52.786
This is a real exchange
of information here.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.830
No, I do not have contact
with Reggie,

31:54.872 --> 31:55.831
and I don't know where he is.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.207
What does he have
to do with this?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.418
Is your daughter
in contact with Reggie Woo?

31:59.460 --> 32:01.545
What

32:01.587 --> 32:04.381
You're asking about my daughter

32:04.423 --> 32:06.508
-Harry. -'Cause I know that
was you, asshole, in the video

32:06.550 --> 32:08.969
Eleanor took. And if I find out
that's what got her killed,

32:09.011 --> 32:11.972
I'm gonna find Eddie Vang
and I'm gonna flip him,

32:12.014 --> 32:14.600
and then I'm gonna come for you.
And if you or any

32:14.642 --> 32:16.685
of you motherfuckers go near
my daughter, I will send you

32:16.727 --> 32:19.313
back to China
in a fucking sand jar.

32:19.355 --> 32:22.107
Do you understand?

32:22.149 --> 32:24.234
Or do you need me to get
your translator back in here?

32:26.195 --> 32:28.614
You really think you should've
said all of that to him?

32:28.656 --> 32:31.617
-Fuck him. -Harry, they probably
just came to get a read on you.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.035
-And you gave it to them.
-Good.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.870
I went them to know I'm coming.

32:34.912 --> 32:36.246
Where are you going?

32:36.288 --> 32:37.748
Get Maddie.
Make sure she's safe.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.124
Maxine pulled the call logs

32:39.166 --> 32:40.709
from that number
we think is Griffin's.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.462
The video Eleanor took.

32:43.504 --> 32:44.963
The day after she sent it
to Griffin,

32:45.005 --> 32:49.385
he forwards it
to an unknown number in China.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.387
Eleanor was just a pawn in this.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.638
I got to go.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.526
Koi.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.236
What?

33:07.277 --> 33:09.321
You're calling about
what to bring home for dinner.

33:09.363 --> 33:11.156
-Let's get koi to go.
-No, no. Maddie.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.783
I'm not talking about dinner.

33:12.825 --> 33:15.035
I want you to pack a bag.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.578
What are you talking about

33:16.620 --> 33:18.122
Put some clothes and your
computer in a backpack.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.957
I got to move you.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.500
It's just for a couple of days.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.588
Is this about Mom?

33:26.630 --> 33:27.715
The people who killed Mom?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.091
Everything's fine.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.634
Just pack the bag.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.344
When I get there, I'll call you,

33:32.386 --> 33:35.013
you come up to the gate. Okay?

33:54.950 --> 33:57.202
FBI!

33:57.244 --> 33:58.996
Show me your fucking hands!

33:59.037 --> 34:00.205
Show me your fucking hands!

34:00.247 --> 34:01.665
It's Deng, Bosch.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.463
It's okay, Mads.

34:07.504 --> 34:09.506
-What the fuck is going on?
-I know, I know.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.759
That move by Chen
surprised us, too.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.051
What did he say?

34:13.093 --> 34:14.261
It was a threat.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.597
To me, my daughter, Reggie Woo.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.265
-You looking at him or me?
-Both.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.391
We have eyes on him but we have

34:19.433 --> 34:20.893
a security team on you
and your daughter.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.020
After Eleanor,
we're not taking chances.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.688
Yeah, well,
thanks for telling me.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.024
I need to put her
somewhere safe.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.567
You can do that.

34:28.609 --> 34:30.527
But we've got this place covered
from all angles.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.197
You're lucky
I didn't fucking smoke you.

34:43.457 --> 34:45.793
I saw that movie.

34:45.834 --> 34:49.254
Eleanor said it's what got you
this place.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.632
-Great view.
-I didn't buy it for the view.

34:51.673 --> 34:54.593
I bought it because
there's only one way in and out.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.261
How's your daughter?

34:56.303 --> 34:58.764
I scared her pretty good,
and I feel like shit about it.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.390
That child's been through
enough already.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.559
Chen says he's with MSS.
What is that?

35:02.601 --> 35:04.520
Like our CIA,
but more dangerous.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.730
And Griffin's working with them?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.106
What makes you ask that?

35:08.148 --> 35:09.483
Why not answer that?

35:09.525 --> 35:11.777
If I knew the answer
I would tell you.

35:11.819 --> 35:14.238
I want to make sure my daughter
is safe. I have a case to work.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.073
Tonight this is
the safest place in the city.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.991
It damn well better be.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.497
I'm leaving now.
Give me 30 minutes.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.335
Okay, and, um...

35:28.377 --> 35:30.295
actually, uh,

35:30.337 --> 35:33.465
hold off on that.

35:33.507 --> 35:37.261
Babe, I need to call you back.

35:37.302 --> 35:40.138
Mr. Mayor.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.349
This is a surprise.

35:42.391 --> 35:43.892
I wish I knew you were coming.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.102
I'm off duty, Irv.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.311
Can I sit?

35:46.353 --> 35:48.021
Oh, please.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.065
Hmm.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.571
What's on your mind?

35:55.612 --> 35:57.406
I'm wondering, Irv.

35:57.447 --> 36:00.284
Can an old friend become
a new enemy?

36:00.325 --> 36:01.910
Well, I don't understand.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.328
I feel like I was set up.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.746
I went in front of the cameras

36:04.788 --> 36:06.665
and said the Elias case
was solved,

36:06.707 --> 36:09.209
that the police department
had made an arrest.

36:09.251 --> 36:12.254
-Now what? -I never told you
to put that out, Mayor.

36:12.296 --> 36:13.630
Ballistics cleared Sheehan,

36:13.672 --> 36:15.632
and we had no choice
but to let him go.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.302
I thought it was ballistics
that tied him to the murder.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.929
To be totally candid, we think
someone in the department

36:20.971 --> 36:22.556
tried to frame Sheehan.

36:22.598 --> 36:25.684
Which still means the killer
is one of your people.

36:25.726 --> 36:27.477
We don't know that yet.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.860
This city is about to come
apart at the seams, Chief.

36:34.902 --> 36:37.279
I don't want a major riot,
or urban insurrection--

36:37.321 --> 36:38.572
whatever you want to call it--

36:38.614 --> 36:40.198
-on my watch.
-Neither do I.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.159
We'll have more than enough
security tomorrow,

36:42.200 --> 36:43.577
and we've been assured
by the organizers

36:43.619 --> 36:45.579
that their intentions
are non-violent.

36:45.621 --> 36:48.707
Like the Molotov cocktail
at Hollywood?

36:48.749 --> 36:50.208
Your people are primed.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.960
Things get out of hand.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.921
My people are well-trained.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.424
Let's hope so.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.509
I don't want any live feed
on CNN

36:59.551 --> 37:01.637
showing our officers
as the aggressors.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.056
We won't be.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.891
But I also won't tell
my rank and file

37:05.933 --> 37:07.267
not to defend themselves.

37:07.309 --> 37:10.187
You should know
something now, Irv.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.690
I've decided to join
the protest.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.734
To be there with my people.

37:15.776 --> 37:17.736
So you're cutting
the department loose.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.780
I guess that means you're
cutting me loose as well.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.324
I feel like I have to.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.576
I think it'd do some good.

37:24.618 --> 37:26.912
Then I guess
you were right, Mr. Mayor.

37:26.954 --> 37:31.750
Old friends
are becoming new enemies.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.629
I fucking babysat for her.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.547
Hey, Terry named me guardian

37:37.589 --> 37:40.050
of the grandkid he's raising,
should anything happen to him.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.511
I mean, how's that gonna work
if he ends up in prison?

37:42.552 --> 37:45.514
You know, maybe...

37:45.555 --> 37:47.891
it's just better
to be like Bosch.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.185
-No, no.
-No, no. You don't let anybody

37:50.227 --> 37:53.313
inside the wire,
you never get fucked over.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.232
That's a lonely life,
you ask me.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.901
Feeling better, you two?

37:57.943 --> 38:00.988
-No.
-Not yet.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.450
I know what you need.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.747
"I know what you need."

38:11.957 --> 38:14.418
How well do you know her?

38:14.459 --> 38:17.129
I know her schedule.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.548
What nights she works here,
what nights she works...

38:19.589 --> 38:21.299
another place I like to go.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.804
You like to go because of her
or the place?

38:25.846 --> 38:29.141
-Ooh.
-

38:29.182 --> 38:31.309
You'll make
a good detective yet.

38:31.351 --> 38:34.396
Anyway, I was thinking,

38:34.438 --> 38:37.315
I'm in the running
for the D-Three slot

38:37.357 --> 38:40.277
on the Newton homicide table.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.572
If I get it... come over.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.699
Work for me.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.367
Really?

38:47.409 --> 38:51.204
Yeah, I mean, I'll...
I'll take you on my team.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.795
What's this?

38:58.837 --> 39:02.466
deep red.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.218
-Mm-hmm.
-The color of betrayal.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.680
There you go.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.098
I want one of those.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.559
You got it.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.311
You know what?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.688
You can have mine.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.273
Mm.

39:18.315 --> 39:22.277
I'll have yours and little...

39:24.279 --> 39:26.406
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

39:53.934 --> 39:55.811
All I'm saying is,
if they beat South Carolina,

39:55.852 --> 39:57.521
they're not gonna beat
the Tar Heels.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.898
Oh, they're gonna give 'em
a run for their money.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.484
Still doesn't mean
they're gonna win, though.

40:02.526 --> 40:03.819
Want to put some money on it?

40:03.860 --> 40:04.986
I'm tired of taking your money.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.450
Open every light switch.

40:10.492 --> 40:12.119
Every wall socket.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.496
Chip this size could be
anywhere.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.171
It's still nice and juicy.
-MAN 2: Mm-hmm.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.590
And I see that you
substituted the asparagus

41:06.631 --> 41:08.800
instead of the herbed creamed
spinach that's on the menu.

41:08.842 --> 41:11.636
Maybe we should get that
changed there, okay.

41:11.678 --> 41:15.974
Sir, I'm sorry, the kitchen
is not open to guests.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.727
I'm looking for a way out.

41:18.768 --> 41:20.353
Is there a back way?

41:20.395 --> 41:21.855
Uh, no.

41:21.897 --> 41:24.482
That leads down
to the machine rooms.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.860
Can you go down to get out?

41:26.902 --> 41:29.988
Only to the tunnels
and they're closed off.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.616
Can you show me?

41:32.657 --> 41:34.659
Right back, Tony.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.462
Supposedly this was the way to
the Red Car lines 60 years ago

41:45.503 --> 41:49.674
for the kitchen help, so they
didn't walk through the hotel.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.904
I'm afraid some employees

42:10.946 --> 42:13.448
have been using this space
as an ashtray.

42:46.648 --> 42:49.317
That's from a fund-raiser
we had here last week.

42:54.072 --> 42:57.659
You said this leads to the
original Red Car subway tracks?

42:57.701 --> 42:59.160
Supposedly.

42:59.202 --> 43:01.579
Under the old terminal building.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.752
You can go back. Thanks.

43:07.794 --> 43:10.505
If this closes now, you won't
be able to get back in.

43:10.547 --> 43:11.965
I won't need to.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.961
How you making out?

50:05.002 --> 50:08.297
It could be anywhere.

50:08.339 --> 50:09.924
You toss the bathroom?

50:09.966 --> 50:12.218
- -What do you think?

50:12.260 --> 50:14.262
You know, it...

50:16.305 --> 50:18.808
Harry. Where you at?

50:18.850 --> 50:20.601
Angels Flight.

50:24.564 --> 50:26.607
I see you.

50:26.649 --> 50:28.025
What's up?

50:28.067 --> 50:31.028
I know how he did it.
