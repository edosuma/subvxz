<i>Humans who live in the Zone

03:48.972 --> 03:50.738

13:22.729 --> 13:25.196
On really hot days,

13:25.565 --> 13:30.201
the sisters would roll around in
the cool mud of the billabong.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.203
And ate berries?

13:32.439 --> 13:34.773
And ate so many berries

13:35.075 --> 13:37.776
that they had juice
running down their cheeks

13:38.045 --> 13:40.412
and their tummies were ready to burst.

No, just shut up and listen to me.

16:35.956 --> 16:38.223
Now, you know you are prohibited
from broadcasting anything.

16:38.491 --> 16:40.291
This operation was highly classified.

16:40.627 --> 16:43.728
80,000 years the Hairy people
have been on this planet.

16:43.997 --> 16:45.296
They predate our oldest culture.

16:45.599 --> 16:47.265
Spare me the sanctimonious bullshit.

16:47.296 --> 16:49.467
You're about to run a snuff movie.
You know what embargo means?

16:49.769 --> 16:51.636
I understand the headache
it's gonna cause you,

16:51.905 --> 16:54.606
but the story happened
and it makes great TV.

16:54.841 --> 16:56.341
And I run a TV network.

16:56.710 --> 16:59.277
A bit hard to run a network
without a broadcasting license.

16:59.546 --> 17:01.512
Your party got elected on the promise

17:01.815 --> 17:03.915

Containment Authority,

the government, they love it

26:17.943 --> 26:20.043
when we're divided, Hairy against human.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.947
Why? Because it weakens our position.

26:25.205 --> 26:27.151
<i>Makes us easy pickings.</i>

27:20.111 --> 27:21.064
Man: <i>It has, sir.</i>

Thank you.

27:34.997 --> 27:36.897
And everything's ready at the lab.

27:43.940 --> 27:47.001
I'll give you the spirit,

Sure, we'll... we'll be down.

33:23.212 --> 33:24.596
It's Uncle Jimmy.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.941
Only one thing I know does that.

33:40.596 --> 33:41.893
Eh, Uncle?

33:46.402 --> 33:47.986
Namorrodor.

33:50.973 --> 33:52.548
It took his heart.

33:52.942 --> 33:54.773
It's just stories.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.428
This is no story.

It only turns up when
things are out of balance.

34:14.096 --> 34:16.259
Who would hurt Uncle Jimmy?

34:17.692 --> 34:19.525
That's for the police to find out.

34:19.563 --> 34:22.402
You said they couldn't find their
own asses with both their hands.

34:22.603 --> 34:24.438
(chuckles)

34:26.074 --> 34:27.257
At the fight,

34:28.077 --> 34:29.543
what did Uncle Jimmy say to you?

34:32.348 --> 34:36.467
Um, he just told me a story.

34:37.431 --> 34:39.866
You know, the one about
the sun and the moon.

34:41.824 --> 34:45.192
The grandfather has to decide
which of his two sons to pass...

34:45.225 --> 34:48.027
- His knowledge.
- Yeah.

34:48.364 --> 34:52.799
And he chooses the sun
and that makes the moon angry

34:52.824 --> 34:55.369
and that's why the moon
only comes out sometimes

34:55.637 --> 34:57.771
because he's jealous of the sun.

35:02.745 --> 35:04.277
Did I get it wrong?

35:06.081 --> 35:08.882
No, you got it right.

We didn't say anything.

Up behind your fancy

Look, all I said was that
we needed to get together

44:54.191 --> 44:56.325
to sort through
the accommodation crisis.

44:56.627 --> 44:58.660
She's got the other

Took me under his wing from a young age.

45:38.369 --> 45:40.702
Brought me up to know right from wrong.

Jimmy always went out
