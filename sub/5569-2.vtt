WEBVTT

00:02.937 --> 00:05.671
I don't know. Pete's always
kind of given me the creeps.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.373
Hey, look, he has
this bizarre obsession

00:07.375 --> 00:09.141
With what's going on
in the kappa house,

00:09.143 --> 00:10.542
Which is weird enough.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.177
And then the guy's got
a red devil costume.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.278
In his closet?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.380
Come on, girl.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.182
Which is strange,
i'll admit.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.184
I just... I don't know.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.886
I really think
i was wrong.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.788
I don't believe
he could be the killer.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.390
I don't care what
you believe, okay?

00:24.392 --> 00:26.025
You have to promise me
that from now on,

00:26.027 --> 00:27.393
You're not gonna go
anywhere alone,

00:27.395 --> 00:29.361
And we're both gonna use
the tasers my grandmama sent.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.231
Ooh, pork rinds.
Ooh, here.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.499
I'm freaking starving.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.234
There is food nowhere
in kappa house.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.668
Ugh!
I guess it makes sense.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.537
The cook did get
her face fried off.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.205
The chanels have started
eating cotton balls.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.341
Number three says it keeps you
from being hungry.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.810
Hey! We're stocking up now!
Can you get

00:44.812 --> 00:46.478
Some syrup to dip
the ranch chips in?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.980
You want to put syrup on chips?

00:47.982 --> 00:49.715
You can't be serious, right?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.216
Yes, i'm serious!

00:51.218 --> 00:53.285
You're insane.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.057
Uh, all right, let me see.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.992
All right, we have
strawberry and chocolate.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.160
What do you want?

01:01.162 --> 01:03.662
Are you out your mind?
Chocolate.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.500
(echoing screaming)

01:11.906 --> 01:15.307
(high-pitched whirring)

01:22.383 --> 01:23.615
(thudding)

01:23.617 --> 01:25.517
Aah! Oh!
Oh, my god!

01:25.519 --> 01:26.919
What the hell's going on?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.520
We just caught a serial killer.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.556
Call the police, please.
Oh!

01:30.558 --> 01:33.025
Let's see who you are,
you sick son of a bitch.
(groaning)

01:33.027 --> 01:34.793
It hurts.
Eugene?!

01:34.795 --> 01:37.429
You know him?
He's in my
poli-sci class.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.064
Oh, my god.
Eugene:
I'm sorry, okay?

01:39.066 --> 01:41.366
I'll pay for 'em.
I left home without my wallet.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.634
Ow, my nuts.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.536
Ow! It hurts so bad!

01:49.376 --> 01:52.444
I don't understand.
Where is number two's body?

01:52.446 --> 01:53.912
Is she alive?
Is she dead?

01:53.914 --> 01:55.747
Who is stealing
all these bodies?!

01:55.749 --> 01:57.316
Don't ask me!
I'm not the killer.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.151
I was just bored,
so i came out here

01:59.153 --> 02:00.953
To look at number two's
frozen dead body,

02:00.955 --> 02:03.122
And lo and behold,
she's not here.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.957
Look, chanel,
i'm gonna be honest with you.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.492
Sort of over

02:06.494 --> 02:09.128
This whole serial murder thing
that's going on right now.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.629
Last night i had

02:10.631 --> 02:13.432
An amazing threesome with roger
and dodger, and i realized

02:13.434 --> 02:15.501
That i'd rather focus my
attention this semester

02:15.503 --> 02:17.736
On getting spit-roasted
by hot golf frat twins

02:17.738 --> 02:18.904
Than help you figure out

02:18.906 --> 02:20.439
Who's murdering
a bunch of dumb gashes.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.440
What are you saying?!

02:21.442 --> 02:23.075
You heard me.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.409
I got eiffel towered

02:24.411 --> 02:26.578
By hot morons
who are brothers.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.780
And now i'm out.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.283
See, it occurred to me
that i don't really care

02:31.285 --> 02:32.918
Where chanel #2 is.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.787
You're the president, which
means it's your problem.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.990
I'd just hop to it
if i were you,

02:37.992 --> 02:39.291
Because pretty soon,

02:39.293 --> 02:41.326
Folks are gonna start noticing
she's missing,

02:41.328 --> 02:43.162
And they're gonna
start snooping.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.931
Don't you walk away from me,
number five!

02:45.933 --> 02:47.432
(laughs)

02:47.434 --> 02:50.169
I will destroy you, bitch!

02:51.672 --> 02:54.173
(indistinct whispering)

02:54.175 --> 02:56.275
(whispering):
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.214
Chanel #2?

03:06.787 --> 03:08.787
(door squeaking)

03:08.789 --> 03:10.789
Wow. Look.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.624
There's a huge stain
on the floor.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.360
Although with the chanels,
it really could be anything.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.063
Bulimia, scissor.
Maybe it's blood.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.231
Denise:
Of course

03:19.233 --> 03:21.233
It's blood.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.202
In my experience,

03:23.204 --> 03:24.670
Any time somebody asks,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.538
"oh, i wonder
if that's blood,"

03:26.540 --> 03:29.007
It's almost always blood.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.877
I mean, you know how many times
it's, like, ketchup?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.145
Zero percent of the time.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.613
Hit the light.
Yeah.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.084
Oh-ho.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.853
Oh! There it is.
That's blood.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.056
Grace:
But what is that?
It's luminol.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.225
It reacts to the iron
in hemoglobin.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.193
Wait. Hold on.

03:48.195 --> 03:51.063
You're telling me,
you don't carry a gun,

03:51.065 --> 03:53.532
But you carry around
a bottle of that stuff?
Yeah!

03:53.534 --> 03:56.868
'cause it also reacts
to an enzyme in horseradish,

03:56.870 --> 04:00.839
And i hate horseradish,
but i love me some arby's.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.507
So what i do is,

04:02.509 --> 04:04.710
I take my sandwich home,
cut the light off,

04:04.712 --> 04:07.079
Put a little luminol on there,
do a little check

04:07.081 --> 04:08.747
Just to be sure
they didn't accidentally

04:08.749 --> 04:10.515
Sneak a little
horsey sauce on it.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.619
Nobody's looking
for this girl.

04:13.621 --> 04:14.853
Now, that's suspicious,

04:14.855 --> 04:16.922
Especially when
the bitch done tweeted...

04:16.924 --> 04:18.056
(phone chimes)
look at this.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.725
"i'm being murdered

04:19.727 --> 04:21.627
By the red devil."

04:21.629 --> 04:24.296
The chanels said she had
some sort of nervous breakdown

04:24.298 --> 04:25.597
And went home to california.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.099
Are y'all crazy?

04:27.101 --> 04:29.434
There is a psycho
killing people.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.036
He killed my dear friend

04:31.038 --> 04:33.972
And secure enforcement solutions
colleague shondell.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.241
Stabbed that girl
right in the face.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.809
And, no, she wasn't that cute
to begin with,

04:37.811 --> 04:39.611
But that is not the point.

04:39.613 --> 04:43.148
The point is, there's a missing
girl, blood on the floor,

04:43.150 --> 04:46.218
And she's tweeting, "oh, hey,
just want y'all to know

04:46.220 --> 04:47.786
I'm getting murdered,"
and y'all are standing here

04:47.788 --> 04:50.322
Like, "ooh,
i wonder what happened."

04:50.324 --> 04:52.291
The girl is dead.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.326
Look, i agree that it does
sort of seem that way,

04:54.328 --> 04:55.894
But here's what's
confusing to me.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.230
Look. Number two is still
posting on instagram.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.132
There she is by
the pool sunbathing.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.234
The bitch is not even cute.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.736
Look, maybe she's just
back home in bel air.
We should find out.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.571
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:06.573 --> 05:08.173
Y'all just gonna

05:08.175 --> 05:09.741
Go to bel air?
I mean, just like that?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.443
Okay.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.945
Don't ask me if i want to go.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.581
Hoes.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.818
♪ now tell me
whatcha gonna do... ♪

05:19.820 --> 05:21.586
Grace:
What's with all

05:21.588 --> 05:22.688
These kappa signs?

05:22.690 --> 05:23.989
It's a thing now.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.024
People are saying that
the killer's targeting kappas

05:26.026 --> 05:27.793
Or people associated
with kappa.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.795
So, they figure
if he knows they're not,

05:29.797 --> 05:31.863
He won't gut 'em
like a fish.
Ugh!

05:31.865 --> 05:33.632
Chad:
<i>It's just blowing my mind, man.</i>

05:33.634 --> 05:36.001
I can't believe my best
friend boone is dead.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.770
Yeah, i heard the coroner
calling boone's death a suicide.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.272
It's a bloody tragedy.

05:40.274 --> 05:41.940
Yeah, well, it
was really bloody.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.442
I don't know, man.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.310
It's just one of
those things in life

05:45.312 --> 05:48.046
That just hits you so hard,
and you just think to yourself,

05:48.048 --> 05:50.782
Wow, it's gonna be weeks before
i really, truly get over this.

05:50.784 --> 05:51.983
Chanel:
Chad?!

05:51.985 --> 05:54.519
Chad, i need to talk to you!

05:54.521 --> 05:57.723
It is so sad about boone,

05:57.725 --> 05:58.957
Isn't it?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.192
Oh, are you okay?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.194
I mean, how are you feeling?

06:02.196 --> 06:03.462
Uh, i don't know.
How do you...

06:03.464 --> 06:04.830
How do you think
i'm feeling, chanel?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.031
My best friend in the world,

06:06.033 --> 06:07.399
Who used to compliment
me all the time,

06:07.401 --> 06:09.368
Was murdered,
so, news flash.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.836
I'm super sad.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.371
I want to be the one
who tells you

06:12.373 --> 06:13.839
How awesome you are
all the time.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.341
Well, uh, you had your chance,
chanel, and you ruined it

06:16.343 --> 06:18.076
When you started
freaking out when i said

06:18.078 --> 06:19.911
I want to have sex
with your corpse.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.714
I know, okay,
and i am so sorry.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.916
I just... I want us
to be together.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.685
I mean, all i ask

06:26.687 --> 06:30.956
Is that... Maybe you have sex
with a smaller number of people.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.892
(whimpering)

06:33.894 --> 06:35.193
What?

06:35.195 --> 06:39.364
Do you understand how
controlling that is, chanel?

06:39.366 --> 06:41.266
Okay, i know you're
not a psych major,

06:41.268 --> 06:42.701
So you're not
gonna really process

06:42.703 --> 06:44.035
What i'm telling
you right now,

06:44.037 --> 06:45.871
But what you just said is
literally pathological.

06:45.873 --> 06:49.374
Okay, why do you even care
how many people i sleep with?

06:49.376 --> 06:51.243
Okay? I always
wear protection,

06:51.245 --> 06:52.844
And it's not like
i love these chicks.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.547
You... You love me?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.616
That is not what i said!

06:57.618 --> 06:59.184
You love me.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.585
Stop saying that.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.456
Look, chanel,
you're hot... I guess.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.291
I mean,
your boobs are symmetrical,

07:06.293 --> 07:08.427
And you shave your box
in a hot way.

07:08.429 --> 07:09.728
All right, but also
you're responsible

07:09.730 --> 07:11.296
For the worst pledge class

07:11.298 --> 07:13.398
In the history of the
university. At this point,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.300
I'm not even sure
if i could have sex with you.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.102
Okay, i'd be doing you

07:17.104 --> 07:18.470
And all of a sudden look down

07:18.472 --> 07:20.205
And i'd see the back
of your head,

07:20.207 --> 07:21.873
And then i'd just, like,
picture the back of the head

07:21.875 --> 07:24.242
Of one of your ugly pledges,
and i'd...

07:24.244 --> 07:26.211
I'm sorry, chanel.
It's just not gonna happen.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.280
I got to break up
with you again.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.748
Chad!
Yeah.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.450
Please. There-there has to be
something i can do.

07:31.452 --> 07:35.153
Ew. Look, just pray.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.989
Pray that all those donkey-faced
kappa pledges get murdered

07:37.991 --> 07:39.624
So you can be
popular again.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.293
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.895
Earl grey and i need to go

Tragic passing
of freshman tiffany de salle...

08:46.460 --> 08:49.394
Passing? She had
her head mowed off.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.464
And the recent death
of junior boone clemens

08:52.466 --> 08:53.698
Has been ruled

08:53.700 --> 08:56.668
A suicide by the county coroner.

own throat?

08:59.172 --> 09:00.972
Keeping these facts in mind,

09:00.974 --> 09:03.575
We must put to bed wild rumors

09:03.577 --> 09:06.378
Of a serial killer,
a so-called red devil,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.013
Stalking this campus

09:08.015 --> 09:10.181
And murdering students
willy-nilly.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.588

09:16.590 --> 09:20.559

To, for example,

09:22.729 --> 09:26.531
Tase freshman history major
eugene melman

09:26.533 --> 09:27.732
In the genitals.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.167
After

09:29.169 --> 09:30.735
Many hours
of deep soul-searching,

09:30.737 --> 09:33.738
I have, along with the
university's board of directors,

09:33.740 --> 09:36.074
Decided
that the red devil mascot

09:36.076 --> 09:38.510
That has demonstrated
our school's pride

09:38.512 --> 09:40.745
For the past 80 years

09:40.747 --> 09:43.582
Is really no longer appropriate
to represent us

09:43.584 --> 09:45.750
As we forge our way

09:45.752 --> 09:47.852
Into the future.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.888
Instead, we've decided

09:49.890 --> 09:53.291
To highlight
this region's proud history

09:53.293 --> 09:55.894
With a new mascot.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Unless you looked
at my course schedule

13:40.654 --> 13:43.254

<i>The</i> greatest film of all time.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.423
<i>Blue is the</i>

<i>Sixteen candles?</i>

14:19.359 --> 14:22.227
All, uh, great choices.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.029
No, in my mind, the greatest
cinematic achievement

14:25.031 --> 14:27.198
Is the 1974

16:11.004 --> 16:14.973

and-and heal

16:14.975 --> 16:16.908
Or...

16:16.910 --> 16:19.110
Do we take that hurt

16:19.112 --> 16:22.747
And turn it into anger
and take it out on the world?

16:22.749 --> 16:25.416

16:25.418 --> 16:28.353

No. Yes,

No, that's a great idea.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.835
I'm in.
Great.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.869
Maybe we could
discuss it

16:44.871 --> 16:46.871
Over a salad or something.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.374
Well, it's a step up

This closet is the most precious
thing in my life.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.198
It's like a second vagina
to me.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.968
So you sneaking in here
and rifling through my clothes

19:30.970 --> 19:33.271
Is a heinous violation.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.940
You have violated my closet-vag.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.608
Is it true that karl lagerfeld
is your uncle

19:37.610 --> 19:39.343
And he restocks this closet
every year?

19:39.345 --> 19:42.313
Well, he's not really my uncle.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.714
I just call him uncle karl

19:43.716 --> 19:45.216
Because he's so close
to my parents.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.552
My mother was one of
the first americans

19:47.554 --> 19:49.453
Ever to wear his
surprise skirt.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.322
She was seven.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.391
I even have one
of choupette's in vitro kittens.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.026
Who's choupette?

19:55.028 --> 19:57.395
His<i> sacré de birmanie</i> cat,
of course.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.530
She has 46,000
followers on twitter

19:59.532 --> 20:01.365
And two nannies.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.000
Luckiest pussy in the world.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.570
Please, mommy,
please tell me everything.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.872
Uncle karl comes here every fall

20:07.874 --> 20:10.141
With trunks full of clothes
for me to try on.

20:10.143 --> 20:11.809
I keep what he likes.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.644
And what do you do
with the clothes from last year?

20:13.646 --> 20:15.580
Burn them. I once thought

20:15.582 --> 20:16.914
About donating them to charity,

20:16.916 --> 20:19.016
But there is something
so depressing

20:19.018 --> 20:21.352
About a poor person
walking around in couture.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.387
It's like, "sorry,
but that lanvin sweater

20:23.389 --> 20:26.157
Is not appropriate for your job
at roy rogers, welfare queen."

20:26.159 --> 20:29.227
Growing up, all i wanted to be
was a fashion girl.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.162
And then tragedy
struck.

20:31.164 --> 20:34.398
Is that how you got
in that hellacious neck brace?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.733
Was there an accident?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.535
No. Severe scoliosis.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.070
It stunted
my growth.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.439
(whispers):
But you're my size.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.675
Maybe on a bloaty day.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.079
Oh, my god.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.580
This is perfect.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.215
Chad broke up with me
because he said this house

20:51.217 --> 20:53.284
Is full of losers. But if
i fix you up a little bit,

20:53.286 --> 20:55.286
There will be one less disaster
under this roof.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.121
I will totally look
like someone nice.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.624
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna make you over.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.026
Thank you. Thank you, mommy.
Thank you.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.694
But first...

21:03.696 --> 21:06.197
I'm gonna need
some pliers.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.705
You know,
you and i have talked

21:14.707 --> 21:16.240
A good game
to those kappa girls.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.476
And i think it's made
a big difference so far.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.378
And while
obviously

21:20.380 --> 21:22.713
I don't condone a serial killer
picking off students,

21:22.715 --> 21:26.250
I must say the intensity of
the experience of being hunted

21:26.252 --> 21:29.053
By a psychopath
has really bonded them.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.388
I don't know

21:30.390 --> 21:32.290
If it'll stick, though.
You know,
that's been

21:32.292 --> 21:33.291
My worry exactly.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.793
Which is why we have
to up our game,

21:35.795 --> 21:40.064
Lead by example, show them
how two very different women

21:40.066 --> 21:41.732
Can work together and get along.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.900
Which is
why you and i

21:42.902 --> 21:45.469
Are moving into kappa house
for a week.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.405
Wait, seriously?

21:47.407 --> 21:48.739
Gigi.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.509
You're terrible at tennis.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.843
I'm gonna leave.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.345
Pack up your stuff
this afternoon.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.480
We move into kappa house
tonight.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.482
And, uh, do yourself a favor.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.184
Stay away from my man.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.153
Wes and i
are kind of

22:02.155 --> 22:03.487
An item,

22:03.489 --> 22:06.023
And i call dibs.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.427
You can't call
dibs on a person.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.463
Chanel #3:
Hi, sam.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.664
Geez. Hi.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.933
Number three.
So, listen.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.935
There's something i want
to talk to you about.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.770
I sort of feel like
you and i are two peas

22:19.772 --> 22:21.505
In a pod, don't you?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.307
I mean, we're both
really smart,

22:23.309 --> 22:25.142
And when we talk,
it's really meaningful.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.510
Hold on. Wait.
Are you a lesbian?

22:26.512 --> 22:28.379
No. No, no, no, no, no.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.514
What i'm trying to say is,
i feel like

22:30.516 --> 22:32.116
We get along really well,
and i would like it

22:32.118 --> 22:34.518
If we could become... Friends.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.454
But, like, good friends.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.223
Like, best friends. Like...

22:39.225 --> 22:40.925
Soul mates.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.831
Because there's something
i want to tell you,

22:46.833 --> 22:49.200
And i can only tell it
to my soul mate

22:49.202 --> 22:52.169
Because it's dark, and no one
else can find out about it.

22:52.171 --> 22:55.039
Do you promise me
you can keep a secret?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.707
Yeah.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.142
Okay.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.544
You know swenson?
The frozen dinners?

23:00.546 --> 23:02.747
They're like the b-list
of swanson frozen dinners.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.815
Like swanson
for poor people?

23:05.818 --> 23:07.818
I'm a swenson.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.954
As in<i> swenson</i> swenson.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.224
We're, like, billionaires.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.226
That's great.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.594
I sort of don't think
that's a terrible secret.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.662
No, that's not the secret.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.064
This is the secret.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.733
My dad is not my real dad.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.068
See, my mom is crazy

23:24.070 --> 23:25.736
And always thinks aliens
are talking to her,

23:25.738 --> 23:27.071
And the year before i was born,

23:27.073 --> 23:29.740
She started corresponding
with this really bad man,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.075
Who's in prison
because he's responsible

23:31.077 --> 23:33.744
For the deaths
of, like, a lot of people.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.746
And my mom evidently arranged

23:35.748 --> 23:37.081
These conjugal visits
with this guy,

23:37.083 --> 23:40.084
And so last year
i took a dna test,

23:40.086 --> 23:43.421
And i found out
this guy's my real father.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.622
Who's the guy?

23:44.624 --> 23:47.024
Charles manson.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.692
What? Are you serious?

23:48.694 --> 23:50.361
That's insane.

23:50.363 --> 23:52.430
But wait, if you don't want
anyone to find out, why tell me?

23:52.432 --> 23:54.432
Because there's
a murderer on the loose,

23:54.434 --> 23:55.766
And no one knows who it is,

23:55.768 --> 23:57.768
And if someone found out
my dad is charles manson,

23:57.770 --> 24:00.104
Everyone would immediately
assume the killer is me.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.539
Which it isn't.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.741
Okay, well, what do
you want me to do?

24:03.743 --> 24:05.743
If and when the next
murder happens,

24:05.745 --> 24:08.078
I need an alibi to prove
it could not have been me.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.747
Which it won't be
because i'm not the killer.

24:09.749 --> 24:13.083
But no one knows when or where
the next murder will happen.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.420
But when it does,
i need you to be my alibi.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.089
And i can be your alibi, too.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.126
We'll be alibi buddies.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.128
"alibibuddies."

24:24.130 --> 24:26.297
"alibib..."
uh, i think "alibuddies."

24:26.299 --> 24:28.599
Right, alibuddies.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.668
So it's a deal?
Deal.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.138
Hey, number five.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.640
Um, we've been doing some
snooping about chanel #2.

24:36.642 --> 24:39.743
Did you know she secretly dated
chad radwell last year?

24:39.745 --> 24:41.812
What?!
Zayday:
I know, shocking.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.581
Can you believe she'd do
something like that to chanel?

24:43.583 --> 24:44.915
Uh, well, chanel's a bitch

24:44.917 --> 24:46.584
Who deserves whatever's
coming to her.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.152
I just can't believe
that chad didn't tell me.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.520
I mean, we were dating, too.

24:49.522 --> 24:52.523
Chad radwell? I dated
him, too, last year.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.591
Okay, wait, you
both went out with

24:53.593 --> 24:55.526
Your friend's boyfriend
behind her back?

24:55.528 --> 24:57.995
Well, to be fair, we
only went on one date,

24:57.997 --> 24:59.497
And it was really
weird, like, he made me

24:59.499 --> 25:02.366
Just watch him play with his
knife collection the whole time.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.702
I mean, i still slept with him.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.036
But my heart wasn't
totally in it.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.371
Chanel:
Bitches, gather round.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.673
Holy mother of god,
what is this?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.742

You can't make a
pledge a chanel.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.905
What do you want me to do?
Two chanels are dead.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.706
I need chanels,
and i'm running out of minions.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.376
Hester, you took
your neck brace off,

25:45.378 --> 25:47.378
And you look, um, amazing.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.546
Hester: My muscles
have atrophied,

25:48.548 --> 25:50.214
And the pain from
not wearing my brace

25:50.216 --> 25:51.549
Has me on the verge
of passing out,

25:51.551 --> 25:53.918
But i've never been
happier in my whole life.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.420
Chanel says i can hold her
hair back now on purge nights.

25:56.422 --> 25:57.421
(mouths)

25:57.423 --> 26:00.090
This will not stand!

26:00.092 --> 26:02.092
You don't have
any respect for any of us

26:02.094 --> 26:03.427
Or the rules of this house.

26:03.429 --> 26:06.397
You don't deserve
to be president.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.065
She does have a point.

26:08.067 --> 26:11.235
Okay, pledges, line up
for tonight's festivities.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.837
We're going to play a game
called cocaine or dildo.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.540
Munsch:
Ooh, that sounds fun

26:16.542 --> 26:18.542
But also kind
of like hazing

26:18.544 --> 26:20.911
And illegal in, like,
what, six different ways.

26:20.913 --> 26:25.082
But i brought
trivial pursuit: '90s edition.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.586
Sounds boffo, but we're having
a house-only night tonight.

26:28.588 --> 26:31.255
Okay, works for us.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.924
We're moving in, to keep
an eye on you girls,

26:33.926 --> 26:35.492
For the rest of the week.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.204
All right, everybody listen up.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.272
Chad radwell at the podium.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.940
Senior council, now in session.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.110
As we all know, boone's death
was ruled a suicide.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.112
Wait, wait, i heard a rumor

26:55.114 --> 26:57.214
Boone killed himself.
That's what i just said.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.949
Well, i heard that he killed
himself because he was gay.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.619
There's no way
boone was gay.

27:01.621 --> 27:02.953
He didn't seem gay at all.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.288
You know, one time we
were talking about boobs

27:04.290 --> 27:06.724
And how much i love them,
and he was like,

27:06.726 --> 27:09.393
"yeah, dude, i love boobs, too."

27:09.395 --> 27:11.762
So, like, what am i
supposed to do with that?

27:11.764 --> 27:13.364
Guys, boone was gay.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.467
He told me.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.302
But i don't think
it was a suicide.
What?!

27:18.304 --> 27:20.638
Guys, boone's throat
was sliced open,

27:20.640 --> 27:24.074
Which, a, is an unusual way
to kill yourself, and, b,

27:24.076 --> 27:26.076
<i>When the cops let me</i>
<i>into the dining room</i>

27:26.078 --> 27:27.911
<i>To get my</i> iliad<i> cliffnotes,</i>

27:27.913 --> 27:30.648
<i>I saw footprints leading</i>
<i>away from the body.</i>

27:30.650 --> 27:31.982
<i>This pair of bloody footprints</i>

27:31.984 --> 27:33.651
Led downstairs to the bathroom,

27:33.653 --> 27:36.153
Stopped in front of the toilet,
and then led back to the body,

27:36.155 --> 27:39.823
Which means that if boone
did kill himself,

27:39.825 --> 27:42.326
He slit his own throat,
laid down to die,

27:42.328 --> 27:43.994
Realized he had to use
the bathroom,

27:43.996 --> 27:46.330
So he walked downstairs,
urinated,

27:46.332 --> 27:49.667
And then walked back to the
exact place he was lying before

27:49.669 --> 27:50.834
And then died.

27:50.836 --> 27:54.505
Guys, i think boone
was murdered.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.007
There's a killer on this campus,

27:57.009 --> 27:59.877
And now he's targeting
the dickie dollar scholars,

27:59.879 --> 28:01.278
So i think it's high time

28:01.280 --> 28:03.347
The dickie dollar scholars
do something about it.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.015
What?
That take back the night rally?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.016
That was a joke.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.217
I say we do the opposite

28:07.219 --> 28:08.519
Of "take back the night."

28:08.521 --> 28:09.553
I say we get 'roided up,

28:09.555 --> 28:11.221
Find a bunch of baseball bats,

28:11.223 --> 28:13.524
Roam around the streets
yelling the red devil's name

28:13.526 --> 28:15.192
Until he comes out
and fights us.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.560
You really reckon
that will work?

28:16.562 --> 28:17.895
Dude, in the ghetto,

28:17.897 --> 28:19.229
If you run around the streets
with baseball bats,

28:19.231 --> 28:20.564
Yelling the red devil's name,

28:20.566 --> 28:22.232
They have to come out
and fight you.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.901
There's a whole code;
believe me, i know.

28:23.903 --> 28:27.137
Now, let's pop some gym candy,
head down to the white stallion,

28:27.139 --> 28:30.407
Get our drink on and avenge
the murder of brother boone!

28:30.409 --> 28:34.244
(everyone shouts)

28:34.246 --> 28:35.779
Dickie dollar scholars!

28:39.418 --> 28:41.485
(knocking on door)

28:42.755 --> 28:44.421
Grace:
Hey.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.557
Can i come in?

28:46.559 --> 28:47.991
Yeah, sure.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.734
Look, i'm really sorry that i
didn't respond to your messages,

28:56.736 --> 28:59.436
And also that i thought
you were a serial killer.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.572
It's cool, stuff happens.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.906
I just think
it's probably best

29:02.908 --> 29:05.242
To be extra cautious
in these situations.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.910
But i do think i was mistaken.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.580
What do you think
about chad radwell?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.682
Oh, no, you're not
dating him, are you?

29:11.684 --> 29:13.984
What?! No, i think
he's the killer.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.221
Okay, well, i found some things.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.856
You show me yours,
i'll show you mine.

29:18.858 --> 29:21.525
Mm-hmm, all right,
well, first of all,

29:21.527 --> 29:23.527
Chad radwell is a man-whore.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.363
Like, he has literally had sex
with every girl in kappa.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.698
That is not news.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.933
Okay, but take that to build
a psychological profile.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.769
He clearly sees
people as objects.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.438
Sociopathic murderers
dehumanize their prey.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.107
Also he's got some sort of,
like, knife obsession thing.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.109
Look, i can't stand the guy,
but do you have any proof

29:39.111 --> 29:41.545
Of him being anywhere near
the crime scenes, any motive?

29:41.547 --> 29:43.213
No, but, ugh,
i'm telling you,

29:43.215 --> 29:45.048
The motive has something to do
with whatever happened

29:45.050 --> 29:47.384
In the kappa bathroom
20 years ago.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.720
I mean, what if chad radwell
is that baby all grown up,

29:49.722 --> 29:51.288
And he's come back
to get his revenge?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.924
Hmm.
We have to find out more
about who that baby was.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.793
If it was a boy,
then it has to be chad.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.127
Interesting you
should say that.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.462
'cause while you
were ignoring me,

29:58.464 --> 29:59.963
Thinking i was a
psychotic murderer...

29:59.965 --> 30:01.965
Oh, my god, pete, moving on.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.400
...I did some gumshoe work.

30:04.737 --> 30:06.270
All right.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.272
So i couldn't connect
any of these names

30:08.274 --> 30:09.940
To kappa
or to the university.

30:09.942 --> 30:10.941
I don't know if they changed
their names,

30:10.943 --> 30:12.276
Got married, got murdered.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.845
But there's absolutely
no record of any of these names

30:14.847 --> 30:17.114
Except for one, and
that is greenwell.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.615
Well, who is she?

30:18.617 --> 30:21.318
Only a former kappa sister
who dropped out of school

30:21.320 --> 30:23.821
Just two credits
shy from graduating

30:23.823 --> 30:25.622
The same year
that baby was born.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.157
It's kind of weird,
don't you think?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.826
I mean,
just two credits shy?

30:28.828 --> 30:30.494
Something pretty bad
had to happen

30:30.496 --> 30:31.829
For her to do
something like that.

30:31.831 --> 30:32.830
We have to find her.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.131
I already did.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.132
She's six hours away.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.533

32:48.968 --> 32:50.634
Hey, girl.
Hey, i need to talk to you.

32:50.636 --> 32:51.969
Where you heading?

32:51.971 --> 32:53.303
Oh, i'm just heading home
from the library.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.638
Let me give you a ride.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.639
You sure?

32:55.641 --> 32:57.341
I'm sure, come on.

32:57.343 --> 33:00.277
Thanks, so kappa house
is just right up the road.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.678
What are you doing?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.147
I'm stopping a killer,
that's what i'm doing.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.849
Are you crazy?
I'm gonna be late for dinner.

33:05.851 --> 33:08.251
But you're gonna be
right on time for justice.

33:08.253 --> 33:09.486
Mm-hmm.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.989
That's right, zayday williams,

33:11.991 --> 33:13.657
I'm onto you,

33:13.659 --> 33:15.158
And you are what
us detectives call

33:15.160 --> 33:18.495
A person of extreme
murderous interest.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.430
Okay, first of all,
no one says that,

33:20.432 --> 33:22.032
And also,
you're not a detective.

33:22.034 --> 33:26.136
Tell it to the judge,
'cause you goin' downtown.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.838
What exactly do you think
you found out?

33:27.840 --> 33:30.841
Found out everything about you,
little girl.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.042
Uh-huh.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.844
I know you thought
i was on your side

33:33.846 --> 33:35.312
While you were sashaying around

33:35.314 --> 33:37.314
In that little fancy mansion
in bel air,

33:37.316 --> 33:40.117
But i been onto you.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.052
Exhibit "a."

33:42.054 --> 33:44.187
You plan on
challenging chanel

33:44.189 --> 33:46.056
For kappa house president.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.892
And what better way to
knock off the competition

33:48.894 --> 33:51.061
Than murder in the first?

33:51.063 --> 33:52.362
Mm-hmm.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.697
Exhibit "b."

33:53.699 --> 33:56.867
Oh, it's just a cd
from best buy.

33:56.869 --> 34:00.537
The same best buy where
my good friend shondell worked.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.873
I was inside kappa house
when shondell got murdered.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.875
Which brings me
to exhibit "c."

34:04.877 --> 34:07.878
What if there's
more than one killer?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.046
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

34:09.048 --> 34:10.881
You and somebody else.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.382
Now, that would
really throw

34:12.384 --> 34:14.718
Secure enforcement
solutions off the scent.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.187
Yeah, while-while
you were in the house,

34:17.189 --> 34:19.156
Your murderous cohort

34:19.158 --> 34:21.725
Was stabbing my friend
shondell in the face.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.761
And while you were buried up
to your neck in the backyard,

34:24.763 --> 34:28.398
Your accomplice mowed off
a deaf girl's head.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.200
Ha! Drops the mic.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.868
This is insane.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.403
No, no, no, no, no.

34:33.405 --> 34:37.207
What's insane are your tweets
to the executive producer

34:37.209 --> 34:39.810
Of the hit tv show
<i>how to get away with murder.</i>

34:40.746 --> 34:41.778
Exhibit "d."

34:41.780 --> 34:43.246
Uh-huh.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.915
Six months ago, you tweeted:

34:44.917 --> 34:48.718
"@shondarhimes if annalise
keating really wanted

34:48.720 --> 34:51.421
"to get away with murder,
she'd find a partner

34:51.423 --> 34:52.789
"and work as a team!

34:52.791 --> 34:54.624
#cahoots."

34:54.626 --> 34:55.792
That's not evidence.

34:55.794 --> 34:56.793
I just like the show!

34:56.795 --> 34:59.096
#cahoots!
Okay.
You know what?

34:59.098 --> 35:00.430
I'm gonna use the hand

35:00.432 --> 35:02.099
You forgot to handcuff

35:02.101 --> 35:03.600
And call 911.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.268
Well, you might want to call

35:05.270 --> 35:07.270
Defense attorney alan dershowitz

35:07.272 --> 35:09.106
When you see exhibit "e."

35:09.108 --> 35:10.407
Uh-huh.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.742
See, you, zayday williams,

35:12.744 --> 35:15.812
Have a chain saw under your bed.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.415
Oh! What?

35:18.417 --> 35:21.118
Supersleuth denise hemphill

35:21.120 --> 35:23.386
Found it.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.955
I can explain that.

35:24.957 --> 35:27.290
Explain it to the d.A.,
soul sister!

35:27.292 --> 35:28.992
My grandmama sent me
that chain saw.

35:28.994 --> 35:29.993
Say what, now?

35:29.995 --> 35:31.294
When they took away our tasers,

35:31.296 --> 35:32.796
My grandmama sent me
that chain saw

35:32.798 --> 35:34.231
To keep under my bed
for protection.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.465
S...

35:35.467 --> 35:37.467
So your grandmother
gave you the chain saw.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.468
Yes.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.903
And i'd like it
if you put it back

35:39.905 --> 35:41.104
Right where you found it.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.272
Okay.

35:42.274 --> 35:45.642
I... Am gonna let you go.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.676
This time.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.512
But i'm warning you...

35:48.514 --> 35:50.447
I gots m'eye on you.

35:50.449 --> 35:53.416
You crazy as hell.

35:53.418 --> 35:54.651
(door shuts)

35:54.653 --> 35:56.720
I gots my eye on you!

35:57.756 --> 35:58.989
(gentle, slow music playing)

35:58.991 --> 36:03.160
You were so right
about salad, you know?

36:03.162 --> 36:04.828
It regulates the colon

36:04.830 --> 36:07.097
And it's not as stuffy
as going out to dinner is.

36:07.099 --> 36:08.999
It doesn't scream "date."

36:09.001 --> 36:12.836
Well, mostly what keeps this
from being a date

36:12.838 --> 36:14.905
Is that there are three of us.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.640
Well...

36:16.642 --> 36:18.808
Miss caldwell and i
are roomies now.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.277
You'll forgive me

36:20.279 --> 36:21.845
If i'm feeling
a little overprotective.

36:21.847 --> 36:25.549
Hey. I, for one, am happy
you tagged along.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.450
Plus, you brought
all this fun dressing!

36:27.452 --> 36:30.820
I'm loving this thousand island
jam i got goin' on.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.289
Salad tastes like a big mac.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.692
(bottle makes fart sound)
oh.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.093
(laughing)

36:42.901 --> 36:44.568
(sighs)
too slow.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.312
(phone chiming)
that's better.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.581
Oh, gotta go.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.649
(laughing)

37:03.555 --> 37:04.988
Hey.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.556
Where you guys going?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.225
My philosophy study group.

37:08.227 --> 37:09.726
But what do you mean,
"you guys"?

37:09.728 --> 37:10.827
I'm by myself.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.529
But... Where's gracie?

37:12.531 --> 37:13.863
I thought she was upstairs
with you.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.266
I don't know where she is,
actually.

37:16.268 --> 37:17.434
The gps said she was
in this house!

37:17.436 --> 37:19.936
Wait. You tracking her phone?
Yes.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.605
I gotta know where she is
at all times.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.506
Okay, well,
maybe she turned it off,

37:23.508 --> 37:26.009
Because serial killer or not,
that's a little creepy.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.210
I'm sorry, ladies,

37:27.212 --> 37:28.378
But i have
to go find her.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.580
This was really great, though.

37:36.788 --> 37:40.357
Well, i am about
ready to turn in.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.424
What do you say?

37:41.426 --> 37:43.460
Let's do it,<i> roomie!</i>

37:43.462 --> 37:45.528
(phone ringing)

37:46.765 --> 37:47.764
Hello?

37:47.766 --> 37:48.932
Oh, thank god.

37:48.934 --> 37:49.933
Where are you?

37:49.935 --> 37:52.135
I'm, uh, i'm at
the library.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.304
I thought we promised

37:54.306 --> 37:55.772
You would never
go anywhere alone.

37:55.774 --> 37:56.940
I'm not alone.

37:56.942 --> 37:57.974
There's, like,
a million people here.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.476
Look, please don't freak out.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.477
I'll be fine, okay?

38:00.479 --> 38:01.478
I'll let you know when i'm done.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.612
Yeah.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.247
Yeah, you call me
when you're done.

38:04.249 --> 38:05.315
Okay.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.293
(toilet flushes)

38:16.295 --> 38:18.295
(gigi gasps)
dean munsch.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.096
That nightgown is amazing.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.666
Thank you.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.234
Um, nighttime
really is the only time

38:24.236 --> 38:25.635
It's socially acceptable
to dress

38:25.637 --> 38:27.304
Like a 19th century homesteader,

38:27.306 --> 38:29.939
Which is my favorite
style of dress.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.141
Good night.

38:31.143 --> 38:32.709
Good night!

38:38.850 --> 38:40.283
Oh!

38:40.285 --> 38:41.751
I almost forgot.

38:41.753 --> 38:42.852
I need to sleep

38:42.854 --> 38:44.854
With a white noise machine on.

38:44.856 --> 38:45.922
I hope that's okay.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.657
Oh! Sure!

38:47.659 --> 38:49.426
Go for it.

38:50.696 --> 38:53.730
(whale distress calls
playing)

39:04.943 --> 39:07.510
(loudly):
Hon, it's a little...

39:07.512 --> 39:09.512
Hon, it's a little loud.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.848
Is there any way
to turn it down a bit!?

39:11.850 --> 39:13.183
No, i'm sorry.

39:13.185 --> 39:14.851
There's no volume control.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.354
That's just how loud it is.

39:17.356 --> 39:21.057
And what...
What are those noises?

39:21.059 --> 39:23.626
Those are whale distress calls.

39:23.628 --> 39:26.129
I find them very soothing.

39:26.131 --> 39:29.165
Are there other noises
that the machine can make?

39:29.167 --> 39:30.700
Oh, sure!

39:33.572 --> 39:34.904
There are, like,

39:34.906 --> 39:38.575
500 different
white noise settings.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.243
"baboon attack."

39:40.245 --> 39:42.779
(baboons hooting,
screaming, screeching)

39:45.584 --> 39:49.486
"catastrophically depressurized
airplane cabin."

39:49.488 --> 39:50.720
(air hissing, people screaming)

39:54.593 --> 39:56.659
I don't think i'm going
to be able to sleep

39:56.661 --> 39:58.261
With all that noise!

39:58.263 --> 39:59.496
I'll tell you what,
we'll compromise.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.231
I'll set
the machine

40:01.233 --> 40:03.233
To "slasher movie"

40:03.235 --> 40:05.235
And we'll leave it at that.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.303
(spooky music playing)

40:12.077 --> 40:14.144
(people shrieking,
screaming)

40:15.914 --> 40:17.514
Yep. You know what?

40:17.516 --> 40:19.916
I actually think

40:19.918 --> 40:22.118
I'm gonna go ahead and...

40:22.120 --> 40:24.053
(screaming and shrieking
continue)

40:24.055 --> 40:25.622
I'm gonna sleep
on the couch.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.024
Yeah, i think
that would be best.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.466
(screaming continues
in distance)

40:41.907 --> 40:43.973
(screaming fades
into distance)

40:49.414 --> 40:51.014
(sighs)

41:02.494 --> 41:03.560
(sighs)

41:12.304 --> 41:13.336
(chain saw revving)

41:13.338 --> 41:14.504
(screams)

41:16.408 --> 41:18.274
(screams)
(chain saw buzzing)

41:18.276 --> 41:20.343
(screaming)

41:28.320 --> 41:29.886
(gasping)

41:31.990 --> 41:33.389
(screaming)

41:45.804 --> 41:47.036
(screams)

41:47.038 --> 41:48.171
(yells)

41:51.443 --> 41:52.509
(grunts)

41:54.446 --> 41:55.745
(yells, groans)

41:56.481 --> 41:58.515
No... No!

41:59.351 --> 42:00.517
(sobbing)

42:10.061 --> 42:11.227
(grunts, groans)

42:12.631 --> 42:13.630
You okay?

42:13.632 --> 42:14.631
I think so.

42:14.633 --> 42:15.632
Girls, go!

42:15.634 --> 42:16.966
Get back to your room!

42:16.968 --> 42:18.034
Call 911!

42:21.740 --> 42:24.240
(chain saw motor idling)

42:31.216 --> 42:32.916
Munsch:
What's going on?

42:32.918 --> 42:34.350
Gigi:
What's going on?!

42:34.352 --> 42:36.219
Didn't you hear the screaming?

42:36.221 --> 42:37.587
No!

42:37.589 --> 42:39.722
I mean, yes, i heard screaming,

42:39.724 --> 42:40.890
But that's because
the white noise machine

42:40.892 --> 42:43.226
Was set to
"slasher movie."

42:43.228 --> 42:45.094
Seriously, what happened?

42:45.096 --> 42:46.563
The girls are all freaked out.

42:46.565 --> 42:47.830
(revs chain saw)

42:47.832 --> 42:49.566
What are you doing?

42:49.568 --> 42:51.734
You're not taking
another step

42:51.736 --> 42:52.769
Until the
police arrive.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.504
(siren approaching)

42:54.506 --> 42:56.272
You're the killer.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.880
