WEBVTT

00:02.566 --> 00:04.166
THERE'S MY LITTLE EARLY BIRD.

00:04.233 --> 00:06.400
WHERE YOU BEEN, GIRL?

00:06.466 --> 00:08.933
IN PROSPECT PARK
WITH HARVEY KEITEL.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.366
HE'S FILMING
A MOVIE THERE

00:10.433 --> 00:12.700
AND I THOUGHT THAT WATCHING
WORKING ACTORS

00:12.766 --> 00:14.500
WOULD HELP ME
IMPROVE MY CRAFT.

00:14.566 --> 00:17.733
SYNCLAIRE, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING

00:17.800 --> 00:19.066
JUST BY WATCHING ACTORS?

00:19.133 --> 00:21.400
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME
FOR YEARS

00:21.466 --> 00:24.433
YET YOU STILL DRESS LIKE THAT.

00:25.433 --> 00:29.566
I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU OPEN
THE DOOR TO A STAR'S TRAILER

00:29.633 --> 00:32.133
YOU MIGHT SEE MADONNA
STUFFING HER CONES.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.066
I KNOW I'D LEARN MORE
IF I COULD JUST AFFORD

00:36.133 --> 00:38.400
TO TAKE HARVEY KEITEL'S
EXCLUSIVE ACTING SEMINAR.

00:38.466 --> 00:41.366
BABY, IF YOU NEED MONEY,
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

00:41.433 --> 00:42.633
I NEED $1,300.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.733
LIKE I SAID,
I'M HERE FOR YOU, GIRL.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.800
REGINE, YOU GOT SOME MONEY
FOR SYNCLAIRE?

00:48.866 --> 00:51.066
SURE. LET ME JUST GO
GET MY CHECKBOOK.

00:51.133 --> 00:53.766
YOU TWO STAY HERE
AND HOLD YOUR BREATH.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.833
WHAT YOU HIDING?!

01:04.072 --> 01:05.506
HO, HO, HO.

01:05.573 --> 01:07.006
MAX'S LITTLE BLACK BOOK.

01:07.073 --> 01:09.006
A SNAKESKIN COVER.

01:09.073 --> 01:11.006
HOW APPROPRIATE.

01:11.073 --> 01:14.340
HANDS OFF, THUMBELINA.

01:14.406 --> 01:17.173
THIS IS NOT
FOR YOUR PRYING EYES.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.473
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO HIDE IT IN MY HOUSE?

01:19.540 --> 01:22.306
KYLE'S DEVELOPED
THIS NEED TO GET TO KNOW ME.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.706
HE FOUND A PICTURE
OF ME AND AN OLD BOYFRIEND.

01:24.773 --> 01:26.406
IT LED TO
A HALF‐HOUR DISCUSSION.

01:26.473 --> 01:30.140
ALL OF THAT
OVER ONE PICTURE?

01:32.073 --> 01:34.506
DEXTER AND I WERE SUNBATHING
ON A NUDE BEACH.

01:34.573 --> 01:37.506
AT LEAST, I THINK
IT WAS A NUDE BEACH.

01:37.573 --> 01:38.706
I SAW NO SIGNS.

01:38.773 --> 01:40.940
ANYWAY, LISTEN, IF THAT LED
TO A HALF HOUR

01:41.006 --> 01:43.273
JUST IMAGINE WHAT
THIS WOULD LEAD TO.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.006
I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME.

01:45.073 --> 01:48.006
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME HIDE
THAT FOR YOU?

01:48.073 --> 01:50.006
YOU KNOW, I
JUST REMEMBERED

01:50.073 --> 01:52.340
THE PERFECT PLACE
IN MY APARTMENT.

01:52.406 --> 01:55.306
KYLE'S AFRAID TO GO
IN MY FRIDGE.

01:55.373 --> 01:59.006
HE SWORE THE LAST TIME,
SOMETHING TRIED TO GRAB HIM.

01:59.073 --> 02:01.080

REGINE, I AM BUSY.

03:01.286 --> 03:02.686
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK.

03:03.686 --> 03:05.620
COME ON, KHADIJAH.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.720
NOW YOU WENT TO SCHOOL WITH MAX.

03:08.786 --> 03:11.586
YOU MUST KNOW HER SECRET CODE.

03:11.653 --> 03:14.386
LIKE, WHAT DO
THREE FIRECRACKERS MEAN?

03:14.453 --> 03:17.686
THEY MEAN IF REGINE DOESN'T
MIND HER OWN BUSINESS

03:17.753 --> 03:20.886
IT MAY BLOW UP IN HER FACE.

03:20.953 --> 03:22.053
HMM.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.886
TWO STARS AND A CRESCENT MOON.

03:24.953 --> 03:28.153
I'M THINKING EITHER THIS GUY WAS
A STELLAR LOVER

03:28.220 --> 03:31.586
OR HE WAS OKAY FOR A MUSLIM.

03:33.486 --> 03:34.786
HEY, THERE.

03:35.553 --> 03:36.720
LISTEN,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

03:36.786 --> 03:38.953
ABOUT GETTING UP
AT 4:00 TOMORROW MORNING?

03:39.020 --> 03:41.220
THE COMPUTER AT FLAVOR
BROKE DOWN AGAIN.

03:41.286 --> 03:43.386
NO, I WANT TO GO FISHING.

03:43.453 --> 03:45.053
OF COURSE THE COMPUTER

03:45.120 --> 03:46.486
BROKE DOWN, NORTON.

03:46.553 --> 03:49.253
THERE'S GOT TO BE A
MODERN COMPUTER OUT THERE.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.520
YOU KNOW, ONE
WHERE THE SCREEN

03:51.586 --> 03:53.853
DOESN'T DIM WHEN
YOU STOP PEDDLING.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.520
KHADIJAH, THIS LETTER
FROM THE BANK

03:57.586 --> 03:59.153
IS ADDRESSED
TO THE BOTH OF US.

03:59.220 --> 04:01.326
HOW OVERDRAWN IS
FLAVOR THIS TIME?

04:01.393 --> 04:03.493
I DON'T KNOW.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.493
THERE'S A CHECK FOR $2,700.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.093
GIVE ME THAT.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.326
IT SAYS HERE THAT
THE $500 SAVINGS BOND

04:10.393 --> 04:13.660
WE BOUGHT 15 YEARS AGO
HAS MATURED.

04:13.726 --> 04:15.426
HOW DID TWO KIDS
GET 500 BUCKS?

04:15.493 --> 04:16.426
RUN NUMBERS?

04:16.493 --> 04:18.060
KNOCK OVER BANKS?

04:19.560 --> 04:23.126
SORRY, I'VE BEEN WORKING
THE JUVENILE COURTS

04:23.193 --> 04:24.493
THIS WEEK, AND...

04:24.560 --> 04:26.760
ACTUALLY, KHADIJAH AND I

04:26.826 --> 04:28.160
MADE THE MONEY ONE SUMMER
WASHING CARS.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.293
AND SELLING RANDOM ITEMS
WE FOUND AROUND THE HOUSE.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.259
AS FAR AS I KNOW

04:33.326 --> 04:36.293
AUNT RITA STILL HASN'T FOUND
THAT IRONING BOARD.

04:38.759 --> 04:43.326
YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO
WITH $2,700?

04:43.393 --> 04:45.593
YEAH.

04:45.660 --> 04:49.126
WE CAN REPLACE THAT SORRY‐ASS
COMPUTER AT <i>FLAVOR.</i>

04:49.193 --> 04:51.326
DAMN.

04:51.393 --> 04:56.226
WE COULD AFFORD
THE PENTIMOUNT CD 625.

04:56.293 --> 04:59.093
WE COULD?

04:59.160 --> 05:03.400
YOU COULD INVEST THIS MONEY
IN THE STOCK MARKET.

05:03.466 --> 05:06.266
SO YOU COULD
TAKE A COMMISSION?

05:06.333 --> 05:10.100
WELL, I NEVER
THOUGHT OF THAT.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.866
I SUPPOSE I WOULD.

05:13.933 --> 05:15.100
$2,700 WILL MAKE

05:15.166 --> 05:18.200
A TIDY DOWN PAYMENT
ON THAT COMPUTER.

05:18.266 --> 05:23.300
SO, ALL OF THE MONEY
WOULD BE USED FOR THAT?

05:24.400 --> 05:25.266
YEAH.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.600
SOUNDS LIKE A DREAM.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.266
ALL RIGHT,
HOLD UP, SYNCLAIRE.

05:29.333 --> 05:32.266
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO WITH THE MONEY?

05:32.333 --> 05:33.566
NO, NO.

05:33.633 --> 05:37.066
THAT COMPUTER THING
SOUNDS LIKE THE THING TO DO

05:37.133 --> 05:39.333
WITH THE, UH... CHECK THING.

05:41.533 --> 05:44.266
I CAN'T BELIEVE MAX EVEN CODED
THE PHONE NUMBERS AND...

05:52.500 --> 05:54.033
TWO EGGS BEATEN LIGHTLY.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.366
BAKE AT 350.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.366
SERVES 12.

05:57.433 --> 05:59.366
THANKS FOR THE RECIPES, MAX...

05:59.433 --> 06:01.606
RECIPES.

06:01.673 --> 06:04.206
ALL RIGHT, GIRL,
HE'S ON TO US.

06:04.273 --> 06:06.073
I'LL CONFESS.

06:06.140 --> 06:08.340
KYLE, THAT MAX'S
LITTLE BLACK BOOK...

06:08.406 --> 06:09.773
YOU OPEN THAT BOOK

06:09.840 --> 06:12.006

06:12.073 --> 06:15.006
IT'S THAT WHOLE
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK THING.

06:15.073 --> 06:17.373
YEAH, WELL,
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.406
AFTER ALL, I'VE SEEN YOU
IN THE MORNING AND SURVIVED.

06:20.473 --> 06:22.406

06:27.273 --> 06:31.606
HEY, CINNAMON STICK,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

06:31.673 --> 06:35.373
HARVEY KEITEL
WAS SO POWERFUL TODAY.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.640
I WATCHED HIM STUDY A SCENE,
THROW THE SCRIPT AWAY

06:38.706 --> 06:40.240
AND AD‐LIB A BRAND‐NEW ONE.

06:40.306 --> 06:41.873
EVERYONE WAS MOVED.

06:41.940 --> 06:43.340
THE WRITER WAS IN TEARS.

06:43.406 --> 06:46.206
GOD, I WISH
I COULD TAKE HIS SEMINAR.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.373
LET ME SEE THAT.

06:48.440 --> 06:53.373
"HARVEY KEITEL'S HOW TO KILL,
DIE AND PLAY THE PIANO NAKED."

06:55.373 --> 06:57.340
ALL THIS FOR 1,300 BUCKS?

06:57.406 --> 06:59.573
IT INCLUDES LUNCH.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.480
WELL, MY TOO‐SWEET THESPIAN

07:02.546 --> 07:05.113
WHY DON'T YOU USE YOUR HALF
OF THAT BOND MONEY?

07:05.180 --> 07:07.480
YOU WASHED AS MANY CARS
AS KHADIJAH.

07:07.546 --> 07:10.246
WELL, ACTUALLY, I JUST MADE
BUBBLES WITH THE SOAP

07:10.313 --> 07:12.380
AND PLAYED ELEPHANT
WITH THE HOSE.

07:14.213 --> 07:15.513
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.813
YOU PROVIDED THE HILARIOUS
MORALE BOOSTER

07:17.880 --> 07:22.246
THAT KEPT KHADIJAH LATHERING
AT PEAK EFFICIENCY.

07:22.313 --> 07:25.113
SYNCLAIRE, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO AND TALK TO KHADIJAH?

07:25.180 --> 07:27.446
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:27.513 --> 07:30.580
I'M GOING TO LET HER KNOW
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS

07:30.646 --> 07:32.846
THAT WE'LL SPLIT
THAT BOND EVEN‐STEVEN.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.746
GOOD MORNING.

07:38.046 --> 07:39.180
GOOD MORNING, KHADIJAH.

07:39.246 --> 07:40.546
WOULD YOU LIKE

07:40.613 --> 07:43.046
TO HAVE HALF
OF MY JUICE?

07:43.113 --> 07:44.480
OR PERHAPS HALF A BAGEL?

07:44.546 --> 07:45.880
OR WOULD YOU LIKE

07:45.946 --> 07:48.313
SOME HALF AND HALF
IN YOUR COFFEE?

07:48.380 --> 07:50.480
I AM TOO EXCITED TO EAT.

07:50.546 --> 07:52.746
WE GET THE NEW COMPUTER TODAY.

07:52.813 --> 07:54.846
SO DON'T FORGET
TO DEPOSIT THE BOND MONEY.

07:54.913 --> 07:57.346
KHADIJAH, I
INSIST YOU ALLOW ME

07:57.413 --> 08:00.253
TO SPLIT THIS BAGEL
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE

08:00.320 --> 08:02.153
AND GIVE YOU 50%.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.920
OKAY, SYNCLAIRE. THANKS.

08:03.986 --> 08:05.853
SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.186
DAMN, IT'S GOING
TO BE A GOOD DAY.

08:08.253 --> 08:10.586
I DON'T KNOW,
THEY SAID IT MIGHT RAIN.

08:10.653 --> 08:13.353
THEN TOMORROW,
FLOWERS WILL GROW.

08:15.220 --> 08:19.220
WE THOUGHT WE WAS GOING TO HAVE
TO PULL YOU UP OFF OF HER.

08:21.786 --> 08:24.086
ALL RIGHT, KYLE,
WHAT DO YOU SAY, AFTER WORK

08:24.153 --> 08:27.320
WE GET SOME DINNER
AND CATCH THE 10:00 SHOW?

08:27.386 --> 08:28.620
( sighs )

08:28.686 --> 08:29.920
ALL RIGHT, KYLE.

08:29.986 --> 08:32.086
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT I HATE WORSE

08:32.153 --> 08:33.385
THAN TALKING ABOUT US

08:33.453 --> 08:35.653
AND THAT'S LISTENING
TO YOU SIGH ABOUT US.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.520
( sighs loudly )

08:38.586 --> 08:42.620
WHY DOES MY LITTLE DIRECTORY
HAVE YOU SO UPSET?

08:42.686 --> 08:46.453
BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE BLACK BOOK
IS LIKE SCRAPPLE TO ME.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.753
SCRAPPLE?

08:47.820 --> 08:50.586
THAT BRICK OF GRAY STUFF
IN THE MEAT SECTION?

08:50.653 --> 08:52.786
YES. WHEN I WAS A KID,
I LOVED IT.

08:52.853 --> 08:55.286
THEN ONE DAY,
I READ IT CONTAINED

08:55.353 --> 08:59.020
EVERY PIECE OF THE PIG LEFT
AFTER THEY MADE HOT DOGS.

08:59.086 --> 09:01.693
AND LET'S JUST SAY
THE MAGIC FADED.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.560
AND MY LITTLE BLACK BOOK
IS LIKE THAT?

09:04.626 --> 09:05.560
YES.

09:05.626 --> 09:08.360
I WAS BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING.

09:08.426 --> 09:10.860
PRAY TELL, SIR,
NOT KNOWING WHAT?

09:10.926 --> 09:13.226
THAT YOUR
LITTLE BLACK BOOK

09:13.293 --> 09:15.660
CONTAINS ONE MORE
ENTRY THAN MINE.

09:15.726 --> 09:17.393
REALLY?

09:17.460 --> 09:19.893
NOW YOU KNOW THE UGLY TRUTH.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.993
OH, AND THAT'S WHAT'S
GOT YOU SO DOWN.

09:24.060 --> 09:27.726
OH, POOR BABY‐CITO.

09:27.793 --> 09:30.193
OH, THE TORTURE
TO YOUR MANLY PRIDE.

09:30.260 --> 09:31.360
OH.

09:31.426 --> 09:32.693
( laughing )

09:32.760 --> 09:35.026
OH, THAT'S... AH.

09:35.093 --> 09:37.560
OH.

09:37.626 --> 09:40.860
FINALLY, AFTER THREE YEARS
ON THIS CHICKEN‐YARD MAGAZINE

09:40.926 --> 09:43.360
YOU MAKE A GOOD DECISION.

09:43.426 --> 09:45.860
WELL, I FINALLY
HAD ENOUGH MONEY.

09:45.926 --> 09:47.193
AND I THOUGHT

09:47.260 --> 09:49.693
RAISE FOR RUSSELL,
BUY A COMPUTER

09:49.760 --> 09:51.693
GLAD YOU AGREE
WITH MY DECISION.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.160
NOW WHAT'S UP
WITH THE BAT?

09:54.226 --> 09:56.493
AS SOON AS THIS COMPUTER
IS INSTALLED

09:56.560 --> 09:58.526
I'M TAKING
THE OLD ONE OUT BACK

09:58.593 --> 10:00.200
AND BEAT IT TILL I'M DIZZY.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.300
I'M HERE FOR THE
WEDNESDAY PHOTO RUN.

10:06.366 --> 10:08.466
IVAN, IT'S TUESDAY.

10:08.533 --> 10:11.133
OH, I'LL WAIT.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.666
OH, COOL, A NEW COMPUTER.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.033
IT DOES EVERYTHING.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.666
IT DOES LAYOUT, E‐MAIL.

10:15.733 --> 10:17.766
I CAN EVEN SEND PHOTOS

10:17.833 --> 10:19.000
AND FAXES OVER
THE PHONE LINES.

10:19.066 --> 10:20.633
WA‐WAIT A MINUTE.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.666
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR THEN?

10:22.733 --> 10:24.966
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.266
IT'S BEEN REAL.

10:27.333 --> 10:31.466
MIGHT I ADD THAT THIS COMPUTER
CANNOT PROVIDE YOU

10:31.533 --> 10:33.933
WITH LOVE AND SUPPORT.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.400
IT ALSO WON'T STALK ME.

10:37.466 --> 10:39.766
WELL, THEN, I GUESS THAT'S IT.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.300
DO YOU MIND IF I JUST
WANDER AROUND AIMLESSLY

10:42.366 --> 10:44.300
THINKING ABOUT WHAT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN?

10:44.366 --> 10:47.100
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.033
I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT TOO.

10:50.500 --> 10:54.666
MS. JAMES, UM, THE BANK
TELLS ME THERE ARE

10:54.733 --> 10:57.533
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS
IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.833
THAT CAN'T BE.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.073
YES, I'M SURE IT'S JUST
SOME CLERICAL ERROR.

11:02.140 --> 11:03.306
( chuckling )

11:03.373 --> 11:05.173
BREAK IT DOWN, FELLAS.

11:07.740 --> 11:09.140
SYNCLAIRE, THANK GOD.

11:09.206 --> 11:12.206
SHE JUST MADE THE DEPOSIT
INTO THE ACCOUNT TO COVER THE...

11:12.273 --> 11:14.540
THIS IS FOR ONLY
HALF THE AMOUNT.

11:14.606 --> 11:15.973
WHERE IS THE REST
OF THE MONEY?

11:16.040 --> 11:18.006
IT'S A FUNNY THING...

11:18.073 --> 11:19.773
GIVE ME THE
UNFUNNY VERSION.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.573
I SPENT THE OTHER
HALF OF THE MONEY

11:22.640 --> 11:25.206
ON MY ACTING SEMINAR.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.573
OH, JAH.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.940
THE BLASTED GIRL HAS SENT US
BACK INTO THE DARK AGES.

11:33.006 --> 11:34.573
YES!

11:34.640 --> 11:36.173
PRAYER WORKS.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.073
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO START PRAYING.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.440
OH, GENTLEMEN.

11:42.206 --> 11:44.373
DON'T FORGET THE BUBBLE PACK.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.073
YOU KNOW, BOSS LADY,
THERE IS A SILVER LINING.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.073
NOW I GET MY RAISE.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.140
I GET MY RAISE.

11:52.206 --> 11:54.140
I GET MY RAISE.

11:59.006 --> 12:01.346
SO I JUST STOOD THERE

12:01.413 --> 12:04.580
AS THEY WHEELED MY BIG,
BEAUTIFUL COMPUTER AWAY.

12:04.646 --> 12:08.713
I'M GOING TO KILL SYNCLAIRE.

12:08.780 --> 12:10.880
Synclaire:
HEY, EVERYBODY, I'M HOME.

12:10.946 --> 12:13.280
OH, SHE ANNOUNCES HERSELF.

12:13.346 --> 12:16.113
MAN, THAT'S LIKE
THE CHRISTIANS YELLING

12:16.180 --> 12:18.513
"HEY, LIONS, WE'RE HERE!"

12:23.080 --> 12:25.713
HI, KHADIJAH. BACK FROM LUNCH.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

12:25.780 --> 12:27.980
YOU JUST GOING
TO WALK UP IN HERE

12:28.046 --> 12:30.146
AND ACT LIKE
EVERYTHING IS FINE?

12:30.213 --> 12:32.680
DIDN'T YOU BELIEVE ME
FOR JUST A SECOND?

12:32.746 --> 12:34.580
I DID NOT WALK
THROUGH THAT DOOR

12:34.646 --> 12:36.380
UNTIL I WAS
TOTALLY COMMITTED.

12:36.446 --> 12:38.946
I WAS CONVINCED, BABY.

12:39.013 --> 12:40.646
I KNOW THERE IS NO WAY

12:40.713 --> 12:42.913
FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN
WHAT YOU DID TODAY

12:42.980 --> 12:45.080
SO I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU 30 SECONDS

12:45.146 --> 12:46.913
TO MAKE STUPID EXCUSES.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.280
HOLD ON, KHADIJAH.

12:48.346 --> 12:50.246
YOU'VE BEEN
RANTING AND RAVING

12:50.313 --> 12:52.080
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HOME.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.080
WHAT DID MY LITTLE
SWEET PEA DO

12:54.146 --> 12:56.346
THAT GOT YOU
SO BENT OUT OF SHAPE?

12:56.413 --> 12:58.646
SHE LIED ABOUT DEPOSITING
THE BOND MONEY

12:58.713 --> 13:00.620
SHE PRACTICALLY
RUINED MY CREDIT

13:00.686 --> 13:03.153
AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT
THE TRUTH OUT OF HER

13:03.220 --> 13:05.420
SHE DISAPPEARS
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

13:05.486 --> 13:07.020
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW...

13:07.086 --> 13:09.620
UM... I GOT A POLICY
OF NOT INTERFERING

13:09.686 --> 13:11.486
IN ARGUMENTS
BETWEEN RELATIVES

13:11.553 --> 13:12.986
SO, UM...

13:13.053 --> 13:15.320
WE'LL BE UPSTAIRS
WHEN THIS BLOWS OVER, BABY.

13:17.486 --> 13:19.353
MAYBE I DIDN'T GO
ABOUT THIS THE RIGHT WAY.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.586
<i>MAYBE?</i>

13:20.653 --> 13:23.153
OKAY, I DIDN'T GO
ABOUT THIS THE RIGHT WAY.

13:23.220 --> 13:26.620
IT'S JUST THAT THIS ACTING
SEMINAR IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME.

13:26.686 --> 13:28.586
IT IS TAUGHT BY HARVEY KEITEL

13:28.653 --> 13:31.686
FOUNDER OF THE ROBERT DE NIRO
STYLE OF ACTING.

13:31.753 --> 13:33.753
COME ON, SYNCLAIRE.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.053
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR WHIMS.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.986
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY
THAT PUBLISHING A MAGAZINE

13:38.053 --> 13:41.420
WITH NO CROSSWORD PUZZLES
AND NO COMIC STRIPS IS A WHIM.

13:41.486 --> 13:42.886
( sputtering )

13:42.953 --> 13:46.853
( phone ringing )

13:50.886 --> 13:56.253
THIS IS JUICIER THAN
THE SOAP OPERA I WORK ON.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.420
LOOK, SYNCLAIRE

13:58.486 --> 14:01.193
I HAVE WORKED
TOWARDS THIS MAGAZINE

14:01.260 --> 14:03.393
SINCE THE TENTH GRADE

14:03.460 --> 14:04.893
AND YOU

14:04.960 --> 14:07.526
YOU HAVE BEEN AN ACTRESS

14:07.593 --> 14:08.993
FOR TEN MINUTES

14:09.060 --> 14:12.960
AND NEXT WEEK,
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO BECOME...

14:13.026 --> 14:14.893
OH! A SNAKE WRANGLER

14:14.960 --> 14:16.693
I'M STILL GOING TO BE
WITHOUT A COMPUTER.

14:16.760 --> 14:17.893
LOOKY HERE.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.593
I'VE PUT IN
LONG HOURS AT <i>FLAVOR</i>

14:19.660 --> 14:21.426
AND I'VE ACCEPTED THE LOW WAGES

14:21.493 --> 14:23.793
AND NOW I'M GOING FOR MINE.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.193
I'M AN ACTRESS.

14:28.260 --> 14:32.960
SYNCLAIRE JAMES IN TECHNICOLOR
AND SURROUND SOUND.

14:33.026 --> 14:35.960
OOH, THE AUDIENCE IS LISTENING.

14:38.193 --> 14:39.126
( phone ringing )

14:39.193 --> 14:41.193
WHAT? DID YOU...

14:41.260 --> 14:43.226
HELLO?

14:43.293 --> 14:44.760
KHADIJAH.

14:47.026 --> 14:48.326
HELLO?

14:48.393 --> 14:50.460
RUSS... RUSS?

14:50.526 --> 14:52.826
RUSSELL, SLOW DOWN.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.760
HOW MANY PAGES DID WE LOSE?

14:57.093 --> 15:00.266
WE'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO DO IT BY HAND.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.733
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
5:00 A. M.

15:10.766 --> 15:13.300
THE COMPUTER BROKE DOWN AGAIN.

15:13.366 --> 15:15.566
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.166
WELL, I'M NOT

15:19.233 --> 15:22.700
BUT I WON'T STAND HERE
GIVING YOU THE SATISFACTION

15:22.766 --> 15:24.300
OF WATCHING ME NOT BE.

15:24.366 --> 15:26.333
WELL, I TELL YOU THIS‐‐

15:26.400 --> 15:28.166
IF YOU EVER DO MAKE IT
AS AN ACTRESS

15:28.233 --> 15:30.200
YOU'LL NEVER BE
ON THE COVER OF <i>FLAVOR.</i>

15:30.266 --> 15:31.533
RIGHT!

15:31.600 --> 15:35.233
BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE
THE GRAPHIC CAPABILITIES.

15:40.366 --> 15:43.066
WHY DO I EVEN DEAL
WITH THAT WOMAN?

15:43.133 --> 15:45.000
BECAUSE YOU REALIZE

15:45.066 --> 15:48.533
THAT EVERY TIME MAX DOES
SOMETHING REALLY CRUEL TO YOU

15:48.600 --> 15:51.900
IT'S JUST HER DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY
OF DENYING HER VERY REAL

15:51.966 --> 15:54.900
AND VERY STRONG ATTRACTION
TO YOU.

15:54.966 --> 15:56.600
OVERTON.

15:56.666 --> 15:59.566
EVERYTHING IS SO SIMPLE
IN YOUR WORLD.

15:59.633 --> 16:02.106
MAX AND I ARE SOPHISTICATED,
URBANE PEOPLE

16:02.173 --> 16:07.040
WITH A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP
AND REAL PROBLEMS...

16:07.106 --> 16:10.640
AND SHE'S HAD ONE MORE
LOVER THAN ME, MAN!

16:10.706 --> 16:12.773
SHORTY, IT SOUNDS TO ME

16:12.840 --> 16:17.440
THIS IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A LITTLE EGO PROBLEM, BRO.

16:17.506 --> 16:19.773
AS I TOLD YOU, THERE IS
NO SUCH THING

16:19.840 --> 16:21.440
AS LITTLE EGO PROBLEMS

16:21.506 --> 16:23.906
ONLY LITTLE EGOS.

16:23.973 --> 16:27.506
( imitating Kyle ):
AND YOURS IS CLEARLY BRUISED.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.740
KYLE, REMEMBER
IN THE FIFTH GRADE

16:32.806 --> 16:36.840
WHEN ROSEANNE ROBERSON CHIPPED
MY WOODEN FOLD‐OUT TAPE MEASURE?

16:36.906 --> 16:41.073
IT SPINS UPON THE
WINDMILLS OF MY MIND.

16:41.140 --> 16:43.173
SHORTY, I LOVED THAT WOMAN

16:43.240 --> 16:46.573
BUT ANYTIME I TRIED
TO MEASURE ANYTHING

16:46.640 --> 16:49.040
MY STOMACH WOULD JUST
KNOT UP ON ME.

16:49.106 --> 16:50.140
THEN ONE DAY

16:50.206 --> 16:52.240
FORTIFIED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

16:52.306 --> 16:55.306
THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THINGS‐‐

16:55.373 --> 16:58.073
AND WOOD IS BIODEGRADABLE‐‐

16:58.140 --> 17:01.913
I TOSSED THE ACCURSED TOOL
TO THE MIGHTY CUYAHOGA RIVER

17:01.980 --> 17:05.046
AND JUST WATCHED IT
FLOAT AWAY.

17:05.113 --> 17:06.445
OVERTON

17:06.512 --> 17:08.746
WHAT DOES THAT
SACCHARIN INCIDENT

17:08.813 --> 17:11.880
HAVE TO DO WITH MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH MAXINE?

17:11.945 --> 17:13.713
I SUGGEST A PURGING.

17:13.780 --> 17:16.713
DESTROY ANYTHING
THAT DISTRACTS YOU AND MAX

17:16.780 --> 17:18.313
FROM THE HERE AND NOW.

17:18.380 --> 17:21.945
IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DON'T YOU
BURN THOSE BLACK BOOKS, MAN?

17:22.012 --> 17:25.012
AND WHILE WE'RE DESTROYING
NATIONAL MONUMENTS

17:25.079 --> 17:29.213
WHY DON'T I JUST GO
TIP OVER STONEHENGE?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.413
( knocking )

17:30.480 --> 17:31.713
THAT'S PROBABLY MAX.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.713
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO GO TO DINNER.

17:33.780 --> 17:34.913
HEY, LOOK HERE.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.246
I GOT A POLICY‐‐

17:36.313 --> 17:39.046
NEVER INTERFERE IN ARGUMENTS
BETWEEN INSANE LOVERS.

17:39.113 --> 17:40.680
I'M GOING TO GO TO MY ROOM

17:40.746 --> 17:43.146
AND MAKE SURE YOU DISCONNECT
THE SMOKE DETECTORS

17:43.213 --> 17:45.380
BEFORE Y'ALL BURN
THOSE BLACK BOOKS.

17:45.446 --> 17:48.146
ALL RIGHT, LET'S BOOGIE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

17:48.213 --> 17:50.313
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT?

17:50.380 --> 17:52.646
UH, MAXINE?

17:52.713 --> 17:55.113
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO THE PROPOSAL

17:55.180 --> 17:57.280
THAT WE BURN
OUR BLACK BOOKS?

17:58.313 --> 18:00.153
I HAVE AN EVEN BETTER IDEA.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.320
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST PLUCK OUT MY EYEBALLS

18:02.386 --> 18:04.253
AND USE THEM FOR FRUIT SALAD?

18:05.820 --> 18:07.953
LOOK, IF THIS THING
IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU

18:08.020 --> 18:10.320
WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT,
FIND AN ANONYMOUS WOMAN

18:10.386 --> 18:11.420
EVEN UP THE SCORE.

18:11.486 --> 18:12.953
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.120
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
WE BOTH KNOW WHO WE ARE.

18:15.186 --> 18:17.053
YOU'VE DATED PEOPLE,
I'VE DATED PEOPLE.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.020
I'M IN YOUR BLACK BOOK,
YOU'RE IN MINE.

18:19.086 --> 18:22.686
WHOA, WHOA. HOLD UP‐‐
YOU'RE NOT IN MY BLACK BOOK.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.953
NO, I CONSIDER YOU
SOMEWHAT A FRIEND.

18:26.020 --> 18:28.820
REALLY?

18:28.886 --> 18:31.586
( sniffs ):
WELL, YOU IN MINE, SO...

18:31.653 --> 18:34.120
I SHOULD BE
OFFENDED BY THAT

18:34.186 --> 18:37.286
BUT YET, I FEEL
STRANGELY VINDICATED.

18:37.353 --> 18:39.353
ALL RIGHT, MAXINE...

18:39.420 --> 18:40.853
WHAT'S YOUR MIDDLE NAME?

18:40.920 --> 18:41.920
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

18:47.820 --> 18:48.953
THERE.

18:49.020 --> 18:51.020
NOW THE SCALES ARE BALANCED.

18:56.020 --> 18:58.953
WHY'D YOU DRAW JUMPER CABLES
NEXT TO MY NAME?

18:59.020 --> 19:00.526
( evil laughter )

19:00.593 --> 19:03.060
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

19:03.126 --> 19:05.760
COME, SIMBA, LET'S EAT.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.160
MOMMY, I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO SCHOOL!

19:23.226 --> 19:24.293
OH.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.660
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
WATCHING HARVEY KEITEL

19:26.726 --> 19:29.060
NAKED IN THE PARK?

19:29.126 --> 19:31.593
I HAVE A JOB TO DO,
KHADIJAH.

19:31.660 --> 19:33.260
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS
COME IN EARLY

19:33.326 --> 19:35.226
WHENEVER THE COMPUTER
BREAKS DOWN.

19:38.026 --> 19:39.560
OH!

19:42.093 --> 19:43.926
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T WANT

19:43.993 --> 19:45.626
TO BUY A COMPUTER
WITH YOUR HALF?

19:45.693 --> 19:48.593
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED YOU TO READ MY MIND

19:48.660 --> 19:50.993
BUT YOU KNOW I'VE
ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM

19:51.060 --> 19:52.560
STANDING UP FOR MYSELF.

19:52.626 --> 19:53.960
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.460
JUST LAST WEEK, REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID TO THAT GUY?

19:57.526 --> 20:00.533
"HEY, MAN, I SAID ORIGINAL,
NOT EXTRA CRISPY

20:00.600 --> 20:02.333
AND I MEANT IT."

20:02.400 --> 20:04.200
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

20:04.266 --> 20:06.166
IT'S DIFFERENT
WHEN IT COMES TO YOU.

20:06.233 --> 20:08.966
YOU CAN BE PRETTY INTIMIDATING
WHEN IT COMES TO <i>FLAVOR.</i>

20:09.033 --> 20:10.733
IF I GET A LITTLE INTENSE

20:10.800 --> 20:13.100
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE FLAVOR
IS OUR DREAM.

20:13.166 --> 20:14.300
<i>NO.</i>

20:14.366 --> 20:16.833
OUR DREAM WAS TO BE
ON <i>SOUL TRAIN</i>

20:16.900 --> 20:22.333
BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED,
MISS REFUSE‐TO‐WEAR‐A‐MIDRIFF.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.533
FLAVOR IS YOUR DREAM,
NOT MINE.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.866
YOU KNOW, I'VE...

20:30.933 --> 20:32.800
ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY

20:32.866 --> 20:35.533
I WOULD BE C. E. O.
OF FLAVOR ENTERPRISES

20:35.600 --> 20:37.233
AND YOU'D BE PRESIDENT.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.166
OF THE UNITED STATES?

20:44.800 --> 20:47.200
OF FLAVOR ENTERPRISES.

20:47.266 --> 20:48.666
OH.

20:48.733 --> 20:50.400
KHADIJAH,
I NEVER THOUGHT

20:50.466 --> 20:51.866
YOU FELT THAT WAY.

20:51.933 --> 20:55.400
WELL, IT'S JUST A RUBBER‐STAMP
POSITION FOR LEGAL PURPOSES

20:55.466 --> 20:58.233
BUT STILL... IT WAS
A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME

20:58.300 --> 21:00.673
TO THINK YOU DIDN'T
HAVE YOUR OWN PLANS.

21:00.740 --> 21:03.173
YES, IT WAS.

21:04.573 --> 21:08.673
LOOK, I HAVE NEVER BEEN
VERY GOOD AT SAYING I'M SORRY.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.240
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

21:15.306 --> 21:16.973
I'M SORRY TOO.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.973
LOVE YOU, BOO.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.540
CRAZY FAMILY.

21:23.606 --> 21:27.840
SPENDING EACH OTHER'S MONEY
AND HUGGING BEFORE DAWN.

21:27.906 --> 21:31.006
I TELL YOU, IT'S BABYLON.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.740
<i>WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.</i>

21:39.368 --> 21:40.584
LET'S SEE
WHAT HARVEY TAUGHT

21:40.650 --> 21:42.417
MY LITTLE
PHI BETA ACTRESS.

21:42.484 --> 21:44.250
OKAY. FIRST, I KILL.

21:44.317 --> 21:48.550
( imitating Harvey Keitel ):
YOU SHOOT HIM, I SWEAR,
YOU'LL DIE NEXT.

21:48.617 --> 21:50.784
BLAM! BLAM‐BLAM,
BLAM‐BLAM!

21:50.850 --> 21:51.884
OH, MY.

21:51.950 --> 21:53.884
FRIGHTENINGLY REAL.

21:53.950 --> 21:55.650
NOW I DIE.

21:55.717 --> 21:57.684
( thumping sound )

21:57.750 --> 21:59.050
DAMN, GIRL.

21:59.117 --> 22:02.057
YOUR LIFE JUST FLASHED
BEFORE MY EYES.

22:02.124 --> 22:04.290
AND NOW, I PLAY
THE PIANO.

22:04.357 --> 22:07.824
( classical music playing )

22:09.357 --> 22:10.957
BRAVA!

22:11.024 --> 22:12.924
UH, BRAVISSIMO.

22:12.990 --> 22:16.224
IF THAT WASN'T WORTH $1,300,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

22:16.290 --> 22:21.890
PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON, GIRL,
BEFORE YOU CATCH COLD.
