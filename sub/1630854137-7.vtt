<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.228 --> 00:12.664
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:12.664 --> 00:14.884

especially heinous.</i>

00:14.884 --> 00:17.452
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:17.452 --> 00:19.280
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:19.280 --> 00:20.672
<i>are members of an elite squad</i>

00:20.672 --> 00:22.848
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:22.848 --> 00:24.459
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:25.982 --> 00:29.246
You are
a household name, Paulo.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.769
You're playing
the best soccer of your life.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.032
I know that.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.163
Does the front office?

00:33.163 --> 00:34.251
They do.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.774
It's what the Kings hoped for

00:35.774 --> 00:38.081
when they brought you over
from Brazil five years ago.

00:38.081 --> 00:41.650
And they want
to continue to...

00:41.650 --> 00:43.347
nurture that investment.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.480
Meaning what?
We got it all?

00:45.480 --> 00:47.960
50 million over five years.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.266
And the no-fault clause?

00:49.266 --> 00:51.573
Thanks to me,
it's locked and loaded.

00:51.573 --> 00:55.359
You, my friend,
are among the untouchables.

00:55.359 --> 00:58.188
Your talent is untouchable.

00:58.188 --> 01:01.148
Always has been,
always will be.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.063
All right.
We should head out of here.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.716
You've got a match
to prepare for.

01:07.589 --> 01:10.592
<i>As it stands now,
we are here at one apiece</i>

01:10.592 --> 01:13.029
<i>with five-plus minutes left
of the game.</i>

01:13.029 --> 01:15.727
<i>It's to Paulo Rocha now
in full command of the pitch,</i>

01:15.727 --> 01:18.382
<i>taking it straight
to Cincinnati's defense.</i>

01:18.382 --> 01:20.689
<i>He gets by one defender,
then another.</i>

01:20.689 --> 01:23.083
<i>No stopping him. There's
four defenders around him.</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:24.258
<i>He tries to find a way.</i>

01:24.258 --> 01:25.650
<i>He right puts it.
And it's a goal!</i>

01:25.650 --> 01:29.001
<i>Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal!</i>

01:44.974 --> 01:47.281
- How you doing?
- Good, good.

01:47.281 --> 01:50.240
What's going on, guys?

01:50.240 --> 01:51.807
Welcome, Mr. Rocha.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.591
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Campos.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.245
We've got you up
on the 15th floor.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.942
Presidential suite, right?

01:56.942 --> 01:58.205
As always.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.598
You're too good to me, bro.
God bless.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.910
Can you believe this?

02:07.910 --> 02:09.259
They're saying Piñero's defense

02:09.259 --> 02:11.696
was the deciding factor
against Cincinnati.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.350
You don't dive
in that cesspool.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.699
Nobody knows
what they're talking about.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.527
I score the goals,
make the plays.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.442
I create.
Defense doesn't do anything.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.052
I hear you, boy-o.

02:20.052 --> 02:22.446
That is why they just dumped
all of that money in your lap.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.056
After this interview,
nobody's gonna be talking

02:24.056 --> 02:25.362
about Piñero.
Believe me.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.755
Hey, maybe we can push it
until tomorrow.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.278
I've got dates tonight. Multiple.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.801
Paulo,
it's for "Sports Wrap."

02:29.801 --> 02:31.934
The cover story.
You got to do this.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.545
I already said all I got
to say out on the pitch.

02:34.545 --> 02:35.590
They can quote me on that.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.895
It's part of your job, Paulo.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.201
No, it is not.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.247
My job is to win matches,
get paid.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.248
That's it.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.988
Hey, come on.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.076
I want to celebrate.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.470
- Paulo, please.
- Just push it.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.429
It is your job,
business manager.

02:48.429 --> 02:51.127
Can you weigh in here, please?

02:51.127 --> 02:53.303
Reporter's not in town
much longer.

02:53.303 --> 02:56.437
Hey, you got to strike
when the iron is hot.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.482
Boy-o, come on.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.441
Let's get that face out there.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.752
Hello, Paulo.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.930
<i>Olá, bonita.</i>

03:11.930 --> 03:14.019
And what do I call you?

03:14.019 --> 03:15.412
I'm Nellie.

03:15.412 --> 03:18.198
Well, Nellie,

03:18.198 --> 03:21.026
você tem um sorriso lindo.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.941
OK.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.639
OK, should we get started?

03:28.643 --> 03:31.646
You've said
you feel like a kid in the U.S.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.300
You love playing mini golf.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.345
Ah, well, what can I say?

03:35.345 --> 03:38.696
I'm charmed
by those little windmills.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.394
Mm.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.352
Since joining the Kings,

03:42.352 --> 03:44.789
the team has won
two championships.

03:44.789 --> 03:48.228
You're about to sign another
multimillion dollar contract.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.751
The fans love you...

03:49.751 --> 03:51.318
And I love them.

03:51.318 --> 03:54.669
But you've also developed
a reputation as a showboater

03:54.669 --> 03:59.108
and a selfish player
on and off the field.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.544
For example,

04:00.544 --> 04:03.417
in August,
when Piñero's mother died,

04:03.417 --> 04:06.420
every player went
to her funeral but you.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.291
That was my call.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.990
Paulo wanted to go,
but he needed rest.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.905
Is that true, Paulo?

04:13.905 --> 04:18.127
Antonio, why don't you
and Mondale take a walk, hmm?

04:18.127 --> 04:20.477
Nellie and I can handle this.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.913
That's not really
a good idea--

04:21.913 --> 04:24.786
Thank you, Timothy.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.136
Let's go.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.842
Can I get you a drink?

04:37.842 --> 04:39.714
I'm having one.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.281
No, thank you.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.283
OK, then.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.936
What else you got?

04:44.936 --> 04:47.330
On the field,
you seem to take pleasure

04:47.330 --> 04:49.941
in humiliating
opposing players.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.421
The fans love it.

04:51.421 --> 04:55.207
It's like gladiators
in the ring.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.035
Or you're a tyrant.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.909
You're cocky.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.218
Have we done this before?

05:06.218 --> 05:08.395
You don't remember me,
do you?

05:10.310 --> 05:14.009
I wasn't quite so cocky
back then.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.793
You interviewed me.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.448
No, I was just a simple fan.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.625
Ah, well,
I have so many fans,

05:21.625 --> 05:25.803
but I'd remember one
as beautiful and...

05:25.803 --> 05:28.328
spirited as you.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.938
Where did we meet again?

05:29.938 --> 05:33.942
It was London
eight years ago.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.466
Lucky me.

05:36.466 --> 05:40.340
Fate has brought us
back together.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.825
Hey.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.827
Wait, come on.
Don't be like that.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.699
You're a piece
of crap, Paulo.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.614
Would you just calm down?

05:53.614 --> 05:56.356
Stay away from me!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.009
Let's talk about this.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.547
You're talking
about Paulo Rocha,

06:13.547 --> 06:15.636
the soccer player?

06:15.636 --> 06:19.335
Yeah,
big fish in a big pond.

06:19.335 --> 06:24.558
And then he came stateside,
and suddenly he's a whale.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.430
OK, can you walk us
through what happened?

06:27.430 --> 06:30.172
Yeah, all right,
so my editors

06:30.172 --> 06:32.783
have been after this interview
for years.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.395
I asked Paulo a few questions.

06:35.395 --> 06:39.399
And then he sent his manager
and agent out of the room.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.922
So you were alone with Paulo?

06:40.922 --> 06:44.229
Look, I knew he was
gonna turn on the charm,

06:44.229 --> 06:47.232
but this was a real opportunity
for me to talk to him

06:47.232 --> 06:48.625
without his handlers.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.933
Right away, he grabs me.
Tries to kiss me.

06:51.933 --> 06:55.153
And I told him
I'm not interested.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.591
And what happened
when you told him no?

07:00.115 --> 07:05.250
He grabbed my breast
and pushed me onto the couch.

07:05.250 --> 07:09.907
And then he raped me.

07:09.907 --> 07:13.520
Nellie, did you
tell anyone afterwards,

07:13.520 --> 07:17.393
maybe a friend or a colleague?

07:17.393 --> 07:19.743
No.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.442
But some of it is recorded.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
I mean,
I was doing an interview.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.489
- OK, can we--
- Yeah.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.754
<i>Jesus, could you please stop?</i>

07:30.754 --> 07:32.930
<i>It's not funny.
Let go.</i>

07:32.930 --> 07:34.454
<i>Aw, no.
Come on, baby.</i>

07:34.454 --> 07:35.716
<i>We're celebrating.</i>

07:35.716 --> 07:38.458
<i>No, absolutely not.
I said stop!</i>

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

07:40.460 --> 07:42.244
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

07:45.290 --> 07:48.206
I mean, I've run into men
like this before.

07:48.206 --> 07:51.122
The money and power
goes to their heads.

07:51.122 --> 07:55.953
To them, everyone's
either an employee

07:55.953 --> 07:57.564
or a possession.

08:53.184 --> 08:54.577
He's, like,
a genuine superstar.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.752
Yeah, which means
this case is gonna be

08:55.752 --> 08:57.362
a genuine pain in the ass.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.886
This reporter,
she's credible?

08:58.886 --> 09:01.323
And she's got a recording
of the encounter.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.803
I think that Muncy's right.

09:02.803 --> 09:05.588
This case is gonna be
a giant pain in the ass.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.809
The press, 1PP,
not to mention his camp.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.812
So Fin, Rollins,
get Paulo's side of the story.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.641
And you two, get the
security footage from the hotel

09:14.641 --> 09:16.991
before some desk clerk
leaks it.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.648
So you're a soccer fan?

09:21.648 --> 09:24.912
No, I'm a fútbol fan.

09:24.912 --> 09:27.001
You know, the most
popular sport in the world?

09:27.001 --> 09:29.612
Well, it's not football if
someone's not getting tackled.

09:29.612 --> 09:32.180
Or getting
a traumatic brain injury.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.661
You've never watched a game
in your life, have you?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.271
I'd rather stop
by a laundromat,

09:36.271 --> 09:39.579
pop in a few quarters,
and watch a dryer spin.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.363
Officers, how may I help you?

09:41.363 --> 09:43.234
It's detectives.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.019
And you may help us
by confirming

09:45.019 --> 09:47.282
that Paulo Rocha was a guest
here last night.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.719
He had an interview.
What's this about?

09:49.719 --> 09:51.808
Is this the woman
who interviewed him?

09:51.808 --> 09:54.463
Hmm, I couldn't really say.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.421
Well, could you say
where the security footage

09:56.421 --> 09:58.598
from the 15th floor is?

10:04.168 --> 10:06.083
Nellie must have misunderstood.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.737
Maybe she did,
maybe she didn't.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.000
She filed a complaint,
so we have to follow up.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.916
A complaint alleging what?

10:12.916 --> 10:15.266
That Paulo tried
to force himself on her.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.877
Did you?

10:16.877 --> 10:19.706
Well, on the pitch, I force
myself on guys all the time.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.709
But on women, never.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.014
You're talking about one

10:24.014 --> 10:26.669
of the greatest soccer players
of all time.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.018
That makes it OK?

10:28.018 --> 10:29.890
What Mr. Mondale is saying

10:29.890 --> 10:31.892
is that Paulo is not only
the face of his team,

10:31.892 --> 10:33.415
but of the entire league.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.634
In five years with the Kings,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.418
he hasn't had one complaint
against him.

10:36.418 --> 10:40.683
The thing is, though,
Nellie recorded the interview.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.685
<i>It's not funny.
Let go.</i>

10:42.685 --> 10:43.904
<i>Aw, no.
Come on, baby.</i>

10:43.904 --> 10:45.253
<i>We're celebrating.</i>

10:45.253 --> 10:48.604
<i>No, absolutely not.
I said stop!</i>

10:48.604 --> 10:50.867
- You want us to keep going?
- Wow.

10:50.867 --> 10:54.828
Well, this doesn't
prove anything.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.308
You want to tell him,
or should I?

10:57.308 --> 10:58.614
Tell us what?

10:58.614 --> 11:02.139
Nellie and Paulo
have a history.

11:02.139 --> 11:05.273
And I am guessing
that Nellie left that part out.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.103
You were in a relationship?

11:09.103 --> 11:13.673
A very serious one,
about eight years ago.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.894
It was intense, passionate.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.027
Last night, we fell
into some old habits.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.594
If that's all it was,
why did she come to the cops?

11:22.594 --> 11:24.118
I have no idea.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.947
My guess is she heard
about the $50 million contract

11:26.947 --> 11:28.383
and was prepared
to use that tape

11:28.383 --> 11:31.081
as some sort of shakedown.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.344
Sorry you have wasted a trip.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.827
<i>You're a piece of crap, Paulo.</i>

11:37.827 --> 11:41.048
<i>- Hey, calm down.
- Stay away from me.</i>

11:41.048 --> 11:42.614
<i>Let's talk about this.</i>

11:42.614 --> 11:44.094
So she storms down the hall.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.096
He tries to stop her,
and she gets in the elevator.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.142
And his team is claiming
that this was a shakedown.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.621
She looks pretty upset to me.

11:49.621 --> 11:52.102
And the video is consistent
with her statement.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.495
If there's no camera
in the suite,

11:53.495 --> 11:54.670
this doesn't do us much good.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.019
It's not great

11:56.019 --> 11:58.500
that she didn't tell us
about the relationship,

11:58.500 --> 12:01.329
so we need to make sure
that Nellie is solid

12:01.329 --> 12:04.027
before Paulo gets too far ahead
of us.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.986
Well, that ship
may have already sailed.

12:05.986 --> 12:08.771
He's trending on Twitter.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.991
A video of some obscure
soccer podcast.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.297
<i>Always got to watch out
for the--</i>

12:13.297 --> 12:16.736
<i>I think in English,
you say opportunist.</i>

12:16.736 --> 12:20.348
<i>Fans, friends, even reporters.</i>
- OK.

12:20.348 --> 12:23.394
<i>There's this one--
let's call her Nellie.</i>

12:24.831 --> 12:26.963
<i>We had a fling
back in the day.</i>

12:26.963 --> 12:28.791
<i>But she was a little too louca
for my taste,</i>

12:28.791 --> 12:30.706
<i>so I had to end it.</i>

12:30.706 --> 12:32.012
Oh, sure you did.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.623
<i>And now,
she's writing a story on me,</i>

12:34.623 --> 12:36.799
<i>and everything in it is a lie.</i>

12:36.799 --> 12:39.367
<i>So I call her out,
and she says,</i>

12:39.367 --> 12:41.195
<i>since I did her dirty
back then,</i>

12:41.195 --> 12:43.545
<i>she's going
to do me dirty now.</i>

12:43.545 --> 12:46.896
<i>Some reporters have
more to hide than to reveal.</i>

12:53.729 --> 12:56.558
I'm sorry I didn't call,
but I have to go back home.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.733
Because of that podcast?

12:57.733 --> 12:59.126
Nellie,
it doesn't matter

12:59.126 --> 13:01.215
that you had
a prior relationship with Paulo

13:01.215 --> 13:03.826
as long as you're telling
the truth about the assault.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.349
The truth will come out

13:05.349 --> 13:08.222
if you look more closely
into Paulo.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.224
But I can't be
part of this anymore.

13:10.224 --> 13:13.140
There's more to this equation
than just me and Paulo.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.754
He got me pregnant.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.104
I have a son.

13:21.104 --> 13:24.238
That you've
never told him about?

13:24.238 --> 13:27.328
I didn't need some guy
to be a phantom presence

13:27.328 --> 13:28.546
in my baby's life.

13:28.546 --> 13:29.983
And now he is?

13:29.983 --> 13:31.985
You took a real risk
interviewing him, then.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.334
I just wanted--

13:33.334 --> 13:36.076
I wanted the world to know
who he really was.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.599
And I underestimated him.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.035
He found out.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.602
Private eyes,
one of his lackeys.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.864
I don't know.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.171
I didn't know he had
that kind of reach.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.826
I mean, Robbie doesn't
even have his last name.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.917
I never should
have come to you.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.266
Nellie, listen to me.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.920
You did the right thing
by coming forward.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.138
You don't understand.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.141
I cannot go forward
with this case.

13:58.141 --> 14:01.362
He's threatening to sue me
for custody unless I drop it.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.624
We can help you.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.234
I don't see how!

14:07.150 --> 14:08.630
Wait.
Nellie, hold on.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.588
Please talk this through
with us.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.243
My son is all I have.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.289
I'm sorry.
I really am.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.602
So that's it?
Nellie's out?

14:24.602 --> 14:26.256
She went back to London.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.345
I mean, she couldn't risk Paulo
meddling in her son's life.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.478
And quite frankly,
I understand it.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.915
Which means our sexual
assault case against him

14:32.915 --> 14:34.047
goes in a circular file.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.440
This one, yeah,
but Nellie did imply

14:36.440 --> 14:38.138
that the truth will come out.

14:38.138 --> 14:41.619
If this guy is a predator,
he's done this before.

14:41.619 --> 14:42.707
What else do we know about him?

14:42.707 --> 14:43.883
He was born
in Rio de Janeiro.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.754
He played three World Cups
for Brazil.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.843
He was also a star player
for a few clubs in Europe

14:47.843 --> 14:49.540
before he was lured to the U.S.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.934
See if you can track down
his sheet in Brazil.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.457
All right.
What about this country?

14:53.457 --> 14:55.633
Are there any other complaints?

14:55.633 --> 14:57.026
Nothing criminal.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.289
And if any were made
to the Kings or the league,

14:59.289 --> 15:00.943
they've swept it
under the rug.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.119
And the owners of the Kings
won't return our phone calls.

15:03.119 --> 15:06.340
They've asked that we kindly
direct any future inquiries

15:06.340 --> 15:07.689
to their in-house counsel.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.821
Look, forget his handlers.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.823
What about his family?
What about friends?

15:11.823 --> 15:13.434
As far as I can tell,
he has no friends

15:13.434 --> 15:14.783
besides his entourage.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.612
He was married
to a Mexican TV actress,

15:17.612 --> 15:18.787
co-founder
of his media company.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.267
They divorced
after two years.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.486
That could have
been annulled.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.574
Was there a settlement?

15:23.574 --> 15:25.620
$10 million.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.970
It's quite a payout
for two years of work.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.842
Find out what she was
being paid to keep secret.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.326
Damn, two years of marriage
gets you this?

15:36.326 --> 15:37.937
I got to get back
on the dating apps.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.677
She's a career woman
just like you.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.244
Yeah, well,
I guess telenovelas

15:41.244 --> 15:42.680
pay a lot more
than a badge.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.595
Don't we know it?

15:44.595 --> 15:46.815
I heard the podcast.

15:46.815 --> 15:47.859
Poor Paulo.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.688
The vultures are
always circling.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.038
You were married to Paulo.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.170
What can you tell us
about your relationship?

15:54.170 --> 15:55.389
Short but sweet.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.694
It beats long and sour.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.044
He didn't pay to keep me.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.306
He paid to leave me.

15:59.306 --> 16:02.265
Well, $10 million
buys a lot of amnesia.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.528
Mm,
you've done your research.

16:04.528 --> 16:05.877
What's this about?

16:05.877 --> 16:08.184
The reporter he mentioned
in that podcast

16:08.184 --> 16:11.492
filed a credible sexual assault
complaint against Paulo.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.016
She has nothing to gain
and a lot to lose.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.845
Nothing to gain?
Please, you're a grown man.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.717
She's just the latest in a long
line of money-hungry liars.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.416
So there were other women.

16:22.416 --> 16:23.765
Pretty good reason
for a divorce.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.376
Paulo was
an excellent provider,

16:26.376 --> 16:30.119
so as far as I'm concerned,
he was also a faithful husband.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.381
It's really quite simple.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.817
I got bored.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.732
We're having guests
for dinner.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.560
I have to check the menu
with the cook.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.040
<i>Gracias, mamá.</i>

16:38.040 --> 16:40.347
You mind if I come with you,
get a glass of water?

16:40.347 --> 16:42.610
Sure.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.264
Your daughter
is very beautiful.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.874
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a blessing.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.442
Also maybe a little bit
of a curse?

16:48.442 --> 16:51.706
So many men,
like fruit flies.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.142
Thinking with their picos.

16:53.142 --> 16:56.537
Yeah, but Paulo,
he married her, right?

16:56.537 --> 16:58.147
<i>Mujeriego.</i>

16:58.147 --> 17:00.019
Cheater, liar.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.631
She deserved every cent
she got from him.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.328
How do you know
he was sleeping around?

17:05.328 --> 17:06.808
I know.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.419
Just look at his face
when he sees a pretty girl.

17:09.419 --> 17:13.467
His mouth is smiling, but
his eyes are already planning.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.383
OK.
Nothing more specific?

17:16.383 --> 17:18.776
One time, I caught him
in the pool house

17:18.776 --> 17:21.388
with Simone's yoga teacher.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.737
Yoga.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.478
More like wrestling.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.219
Their clothes were half off.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.263
And what did you do?

17:27.263 --> 17:28.612
I fired her.

17:28.612 --> 17:29.657
I didn't tell Simone.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.789
She thinks she quit.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.488
Does this yoga teacher
have a name?

17:39.971 --> 17:41.799
Ebony Jones
doesn't work here anymore.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.627
- And why is that?
- I had to let her go.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.977
Can you tell
us what happened?

17:45.977 --> 17:48.589
She threatened
to sue one of our clients.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.981
Completely unfounded too.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.071
Is this client's name
Simone Rocha?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.246
You know her?

17:53.246 --> 17:55.335
Then you know Simone
and her ex, Paulo,

17:55.335 --> 17:57.685
were Physique's golden geese.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.469
Ebony, on the other hand,
was bad for business.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.602
You got a number
or an address?

18:01.602 --> 18:03.734
Sorry, once an employee
is no longer an employee,

18:03.734 --> 18:05.171
we dump their info.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.042
Mm-hmm, thanks.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.827
So what now?

18:09.827 --> 18:11.568
Well, if Ebony followed
through with the lawsuit,

18:11.568 --> 18:13.701
it'll still be on record
with the courthouse.

18:13.701 --> 18:16.095
I'll call Fin.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.706
Sup, Rhonda?

18:18.706 --> 18:21.012
Fin, look at you.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.319
How long has it been?
- It's been too long.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.755
I brought you a gift.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.888
Spring rolls from Hop Kee's.
Still your favorite?

18:26.888 --> 18:28.759
Of course,
'cause you know nothing

18:28.759 --> 18:30.674
and no one changes around here.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.198
- Too old for that.
- Yes.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.243
- I need some help with a case.
- OK.

18:34.243 --> 18:38.073
It's Ebony Jones
versus Simone Rocha.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.208
No Simone.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.343
Wait, you must mean
Paulo Rocha.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.040
- Paulo, really?
- Yes.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.565
Which year are you looking for?

18:51.565 --> 18:54.089
There's more than one case.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.047
We got him now.

18:56.047 --> 18:59.486
Paulo's been sued
for sexual assault 12 times.

18:59.486 --> 19:00.704
12 times?

19:00.704 --> 19:02.053
Yeah, civil cases.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.881
None of the vics took it
to the police.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.100
Were there settlements?

19:05.100 --> 19:06.884
All but one,
and that's only

19:06.884 --> 19:09.452
because it was filed
two days ago.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.932
So it hasn't even gone
to trial?

19:10.932 --> 19:11.933
Mm-mm.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.589
I'll call Carisi and see
if I can get a subpoena

19:15.589 --> 19:17.547
for Paulo's bank statements.

19:17.547 --> 19:21.160
In the meantime, you find these
women, every damn one of them.

19:23.031 --> 19:23.988
Mm-hmm.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.259
I did file a lawsuit
against Paulo two days ago,

19:33.259 --> 19:35.565
but I changed my mind.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.045
I can't really
talk about it, though.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.438
I signed an NDA.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.702
How about off the record,
Aline?

19:41.702 --> 19:44.008
I guess that's OK.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.096
I met up with Paulo.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.142
He was wasted,
in a foul mood.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.317
About what?

19:48.317 --> 19:50.885
He was ranting
about that reporter chick.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.103
He told you about her?

19:52.103 --> 19:54.367
It totally killed the vibe.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.673
Asked him
if I could take a rain check.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.372
Let me guess.
The check bounced.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.722
I was just supposed
to give Paulo a private lesson,

20:01.722 --> 20:03.332
and he said
that wasn't what he wanted.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.160
He was super aggressive.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.509
Followed me
into the pool house.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.076
Couldn't keep his hands off
of me.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.686
How'd you handle that, Ebony?

20:09.686 --> 20:12.080
I pepper-sprayed him
and walked out.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.430
And after that,
Simone's mother fired me.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.040
I'm trying
to give Paulo physical therapy,

20:16.040 --> 20:19.043
and he's pulling out his thing,
asking me to touch it.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.001
What did you do?

20:20.001 --> 20:21.045
<i>I froze.</i>

20:21.045 --> 20:22.395
He's a VIP.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.397
Nobody ever says anything bad
about him.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.094
I thought maybe it was just me.

20:26.094 --> 20:28.096
Why didn't you
file a police report?

20:28.096 --> 20:29.358
He was too powerful.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.534
I thought I'd never work again.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.624
Sometimes I hate
those locker room situations.

20:34.624 --> 20:38.280
But I can't talk 'cause--
- You signed a NDA.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.064
The women that agreed
to talk to us--

20:40.064 --> 20:42.110
therapist,
masseuses, trainers--

20:42.110 --> 20:44.678
all told a similar version
of the same story

20:44.678 --> 20:45.983
consistent with Nellie's.

20:45.983 --> 20:49.770
OK, so groping, fondling,
forcible contact.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.424
That's sex abuse one.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.904
The problem is
we're hamstrung by the NDAs.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.211
Well, what about the woman
who just filed the lawsuit?

20:56.211 --> 20:58.648
Aline?
- Settled before the ink dried.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.520
OK, well,
Rollins and Muncy

21:00.520 --> 21:03.305
are scouring through
his financial statements.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.307
Hopefully something
will come of that.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.309
Were you able to track down
his Brazilian record?

21:07.309 --> 21:09.093
From what I can tell,
it doesn't exist.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.836
- Ah, Chief--
- We need to talk.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.711
What's going on?

21:17.711 --> 21:21.192
I was hoping
you could tell me.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.759
Anything I need to know?

21:22.759 --> 21:25.806
Some heavy hitter you got
in your crosshairs maybe?

21:25.806 --> 21:27.982
Well, if you're talking
about Paulo Rocha--

21:27.982 --> 21:29.375
Yeah, you know I am.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.379
We're working the case.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.989
Our complainant fell through,

21:34.989 --> 21:39.298
but we found several women
who sued him in civil court.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.169
So this is
an ongoing investigation.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.084
Way I hear it,
it's an ongoing campaign

21:43.084 --> 21:44.564
of harassment.
- What?

21:44.564 --> 21:46.348
Badgering
his former employees,

21:46.348 --> 21:47.915
even after they've asked you
to stop?

21:47.915 --> 21:49.438
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.353
Yeah,
Rocha's lawyer called 1PP.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.224
Said these are
just hardworking people

21:53.224 --> 21:54.574
who want to be left alone.
- Chief--

21:54.574 --> 21:56.706
And then he threatens
to sue the department.

21:56.706 --> 22:00.362
Hang on,
these women were not pressured

22:00.362 --> 22:02.408
to come forward.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.975
Are you sure about that?

22:04.975 --> 22:06.673
Yes.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.718
'Cause
the deputy commissioner

22:08.718 --> 22:10.851
had me on the phone last night,
00 a.m.

22:10.851 --> 22:14.463
So if you don't want me calling
you tonight, waking you up,

22:14.463 --> 22:16.204
then we got to fix this.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.342
Perhaps it was
a communication breakdown

22:23.342 --> 22:24.734
within your squad, Captain,

22:24.734 --> 22:26.954
because we were
under the impression

22:26.954 --> 22:28.477
that this matter was closed.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.871
Nellie withdrew
her complaint, right?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.133
She did, yes,

22:32.133 --> 22:34.614
but when we find
a potential victim credible,

22:34.614 --> 22:37.704
there's just a few more steps
that we need to take.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.401
It's just standard procedure.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.795
Well, it doesn't
feel standard to me.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.536
It feels like profiling.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.495
I'll handle this, Paulo.

22:46.495 --> 22:49.368
Your complaining witness
drops out,

22:49.368 --> 22:51.457
and yet, you request
a court order

22:51.457 --> 22:52.849
for my client's
financial records

22:52.849 --> 22:55.722
and continue to harass
his family and associates?

22:55.722 --> 22:58.028
No one was harassed, Counselor.

22:58.028 --> 23:01.945
As I said before, we were
following up on a few leads.

23:01.945 --> 23:05.209
Well, these statements
tell a different story.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.342
Four of the women
you interviewed

23:07.342 --> 23:09.866
attested that SVU's
repeated follow-ups

23:09.866 --> 23:12.652
left them feeling overburdened
and threatened.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.875
We both know
that's not what happened.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.095
Why don't we
let a judge decide?

23:21.095 --> 23:22.531
We can take these
to one right now.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.577
No, there's no need.
No need.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.839
You have our assurance

23:25.839 --> 23:28.407
these people
won't be bothered anymore.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.496
Isn't that right,
Captain Benson?

23:31.975 --> 23:33.324
Good.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.719
We appreciate your cooperation.

23:36.719 --> 23:39.896
Captain Benson.

23:39.896 --> 23:43.596
If you talk to Nellie,
tell her no hard feelings.

23:43.596 --> 23:47.121
I always admired her.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.645
You know,
I'm curious.

23:49.645 --> 23:53.301
If you didn't do
anything wrong,

23:53.301 --> 23:55.912
why not just let us
do our jobs?

23:55.912 --> 23:59.394
Well, when a mosquito's
buzzing around my face,

23:59.394 --> 24:00.743
I don't just stand there.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.876
- Mm.
- I swat it away.

24:02.876 --> 24:06.183
Oh, that's poetic.

24:06.183 --> 24:10.449
You know, let's get
something straight, Paulo.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.886
I'm not afraid of you.
- Captain.

24:12.886 --> 24:15.366
And you have no leverage
over me,

24:15.366 --> 24:17.934
so make all the threats
you want.

24:17.934 --> 24:23.331
But sooner or later,
I will find something.

24:30.033 --> 24:32.427
It's just unbelievable.

24:32.427 --> 24:33.559
How'd it go with Paulo?

24:33.559 --> 24:35.604
This guy thinks
that he's Teflon.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.520
And they also claimed
that they have a statement

24:38.520 --> 24:41.175
from women that we interviewed
alleging harassment.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.437
Harassment by us?

24:42.437 --> 24:44.526
That's either doctored
or coerced.

24:44.526 --> 24:47.660
Look, I know that this guy
likes to play in the mud.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.358
I really want to call his
bluff, but we need ammo, guys.

24:50.358 --> 24:53.100
And we're running out of time.
- Well, maybe this will help.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.929
So his corporate accounts,
they show us what we expected.

24:55.929 --> 24:56.930
One-time payments.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.192
It's $100,000

24:58.192 --> 25:00.150
to each of the women
that he settled with.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.978
Right, nothing else out
of the ordinary there.

25:01.978 --> 25:05.678
But his personal accounts,
they reveal this little tidbit.

25:05.678 --> 25:08.985
Cash withdrawals, right?
Starting June 2021.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.552
And they're taken out quarterly.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.119
Same amount
he paid his victims.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.947
And this is the last one?

25:13.947 --> 25:15.862
Yeah, this morning.

25:15.862 --> 25:19.648
Paulo's trying to hide
something from his own people.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.171
Follow the money.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.782
That means follow him.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.318
What's he waiting for?

25:37.318 --> 25:39.059
Uber back to Brazil?

25:41.583 --> 25:44.543
How can you eat that crap?

25:44.543 --> 25:46.109
You know how processed
that stuff is?

25:46.109 --> 25:47.415
You're right.

25:47.415 --> 25:50.374
It's just the vending machine
was out of kale.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.726
Ooh, here we go.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.904
Oh, whoa.
Who's that?

26:00.646 --> 26:02.473
She looks familiar.

26:06.869 --> 26:10.003
Uh-huh, Paulo's Instagram.

26:10.003 --> 26:13.746
Yeah, Paulo,
his business manager, Antonio,

26:13.746 --> 26:16.487
and Antonio's wife,
Marcía Campos.

26:21.841 --> 26:25.018
Is Antonio's wife
taking a payoff?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.500
We may have just found
woman number 13.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.596
Mrs. Campos.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.640
Can I help you?

26:38.640 --> 26:39.815
I'm Sergeant Tutuola.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.121
This is Detective Rollins.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.166
We wanted to talk to you
about Paulo Rocha.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.254
He's my husband's client.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.605
I have nothing to say
about him.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.868
You have anything to say
about this?

26:51.610 --> 26:54.395
Why was Pablo handing you
that envelope, Mrs. Campos?

26:54.395 --> 26:56.005
That's none of your business.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.834
I can't talk to you.
Paulo is...

26:58.834 --> 27:00.314
You wouldn't understand.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.924
- Help us understand.
- I've done nothing wrong.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.622
Mrs. Campos, we're not
accusing you of anything.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.449
We just want--
- To ruin my marriage?

27:07.190 --> 27:09.323
Stay away from me
and my family.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.240
- Mom, everything OK?
- Take these bags.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.634
Go.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.420
<i>OK, so we've
hit a speed bump.</i>

27:19.420 --> 27:23.380
Do we think
that Marcía is a victim?

27:23.380 --> 27:25.121
She was definitely
hiding something.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.689
I mean, her husband handles
Paulo's finances, right?

27:27.689 --> 27:31.040
He's the one that paid
all the other women directly?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.216
So Paulo's
sidestepping Antonio.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.218
Which brings us back
to Marcía.

27:35.218 --> 27:37.699
With her daughter, yeah.

27:37.699 --> 27:40.789
This is Ana Campos, 17.

27:40.789 --> 27:43.139
Only child
of Antonio and Marcía.

27:43.139 --> 27:45.054
Yeah, we saw her
at the Campos' house.

27:45.054 --> 27:46.534
Her page is chock-full
of photos

27:46.534 --> 27:49.102
of her and Paulo together
at Wembley,

27:49.102 --> 27:52.192
in Saint-Tropez,
on the Rialto Bridge.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.846
I mean, she's probably
known Paulo her whole life.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.238
He's like an uncle.

27:55.238 --> 27:57.023
Plus, he's famous.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.415
Well, sure,
but if that's the case,

27:58.415 --> 28:01.636
then why would he just
disappear from her feed?

28:01.636 --> 28:03.072
When?

28:03.072 --> 28:06.902
June 2021,
when she was 16.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.251
And I mean disappeared.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.601
Not a single photo
of the two of them together.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.168
June 2021?

28:12.168 --> 28:13.648
That's around the time

28:13.648 --> 28:15.432
Paulo started
making cash withdrawals

28:15.432 --> 28:16.825
without Antonio knowing
about it.

28:16.825 --> 28:19.045
And it's not like
Ana stopped posting either.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.394
But all of a sudden,
nothing with Paulo?

28:20.394 --> 28:21.656
I mean,
something happened there.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.963
OK, so track her down
and find out what.

28:29.403 --> 28:31.448
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.366
Hey, I'm so sorry
to bother you.

28:36.366 --> 28:39.152
Um, I feel like I recognize you
from your Instagram.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.762
Ana?
- Yeah.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.024
Hi.
- Hi!

28:42.024 --> 28:43.417
Oh, my God, girl,
those photos

28:43.417 --> 28:45.375
of you and Paulo Rocha
are fire,

28:45.375 --> 28:47.247
and we need more of them.
- Thanks.

28:47.247 --> 28:50.424
But I'm not really allowed
to post about him anymore.

28:50.424 --> 28:51.730
Really? Why?
Did you get in trouble

28:51.730 --> 28:53.775
for, like,
stalking him or something?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.124
What? No.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.778
It was more like
he was stalking me.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.084
Really?

29:00.086 --> 29:01.217
He and I had a thing.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.479
Stop.
No, you didn't.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.612
Yeah, we hooked up last year.

29:04.612 --> 29:05.874
Oh, my God.
I'm so jealous.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.137
I've seen pictures of his abs.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.312
But you're so young.

29:09.312 --> 29:11.140
You must have been,
like, a baby.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.795
I was 16.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.145
He gave me this on my birthday.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.234
- Wow.
- They're real.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.323
It started the next day
at his penthouse.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.891
He was all over me.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.501
Really?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.204
Interesting place.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.251
The monks made these
for kings,

29:35.251 --> 29:37.863
but they worked
in ice cold cells.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.778
Total silence.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.085
Sometimes they left
little complaints.

29:43.085 --> 29:47.046
Jokes in the margins.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.177
Like here.

29:48.177 --> 29:51.702
"This paper sure is hairy."

29:53.008 --> 29:55.228
It makes them
seem more relatable.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.405
But you're not here
for the art.

29:58.405 --> 30:02.539
We looked into Paulo's
personal bank account,

30:02.539 --> 30:06.152
the one
you don't have access to.

30:06.152 --> 30:08.023
We found he's been
making cash withdrawals

30:08.023 --> 30:10.025
every few months and...

30:10.025 --> 30:13.942
secretly meeting with your wife
to give them to her.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.379
Marcía?
You're lying.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.251
Well,
Marcía wouldn't talk to us.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.731
But I'm sorry
to have to tell you this,

30:20.731 --> 30:24.735
but your daughter did.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.389
- Ana?
- Ana.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.348
Paulo had a sexual relationship
with Ana

30:28.348 --> 30:29.828
when she was 16 years old.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.047
We think Marcía found out.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.876
Your best friend has been
paying her off ever since.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.836
No, this isn't true.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.099
No, my wife would tell me.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.449
I would know.
I know everything.

30:42.449 --> 30:44.190
No, no, no, no.
- Mm.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.238
Wait.
Ana told you this?

30:49.238 --> 30:50.849
Your daughter
is not to blame here.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.634
Look, a young girl,
stars in her eyes.

30:53.634 --> 30:57.943
I--I hate to admit it,
but I was a fan of the guy too.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.162
Obviously, not anymore.

31:00.162 --> 31:03.644
You know Paulo
better than anyone.

31:03.644 --> 31:05.385
You think your daughter
would be off-limits

31:05.385 --> 31:06.647
to a man who has none?

31:11.347 --> 31:16.178
When we were growing up,
I was older.

31:16.178 --> 31:19.790
Paulo looked at me
like I was his hero.

31:19.790 --> 31:24.447
Even after his star rose,

31:24.447 --> 31:27.755
I've been the one
making sure it didn't dim.

31:27.755 --> 31:30.627
You made him who he is.

31:30.627 --> 31:33.413
And you protected him
from all the other women.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.936
- From himself.
- Yeah.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.678
And he repays you by using
your teenage daughter

31:37.678 --> 31:40.333
like she was another one
of his conquests.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.259
Hey.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.478
<i>Olá, meu amigo.</i>

31:55.478 --> 31:57.872
I'm making feijoada
for dinner tonight.

31:57.872 --> 32:00.309
- A little taste of home, huh?
- Eh.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.311
<i>She's a girl
I want to impress.</i>

32:02.311 --> 32:04.966
<i>Hey, you're welcome to join.</i>

32:04.966 --> 32:07.229
<i>I can't stay.</i>

32:07.229 --> 32:08.970
Make sure nobody
enters this building

32:08.970 --> 32:11.712
who doesn't live here.
- I'll call Fin and Muncy.

32:15.020 --> 32:19.328
I remember this day
at Praia Vermelha.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.678
You were running around,

32:21.678 --> 32:26.509
following me everywhere I went,
like my shadow.

32:26.509 --> 32:29.382
It's funny
how things change, right?

32:32.863 --> 32:35.127
I had another visit
from the police today.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.867
Jackals.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.741
Did you take care of it?

32:40.741 --> 32:42.221
For now.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.527
But you heard that captain.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.225
They're gonna keep looking.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.575
You went too far, Paulo.

32:50.403 --> 32:54.189
Do you remember
those old westerns

32:54.189 --> 32:56.539
where the outlaw
would rob the bank?

32:58.933 --> 33:00.979
That's me.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.416
I'm a safecracker.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.766
<i>But you don't blow off
the doors with dynamite.</i>

33:08.029 --> 33:12.555
You listen for the clicks.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.209
- The clicks?
- Mm-hmm.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.690
Trainers, masseuses--
one click.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.518
That's barely a challenge.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.389
A professional woman
like Nellie--

33:20.389 --> 33:22.957
a reporter--
two clicks.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.915
It's a better challenge.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.917
But that door
was already opened.

33:26.917 --> 33:30.530
And once it's open,
it never shuts.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.402
Yeah, and a young woman,

33:33.402 --> 33:35.578
like my Ana,

33:35.578 --> 33:37.667
she'd be how many clicks
to you, Paulo?

33:37.667 --> 33:38.668
Ana?

33:42.977 --> 33:45.110
What the hell is that?

33:45.110 --> 33:50.289
The money you gave Marcía
to keep your secret...

33:50.289 --> 33:53.857
that you violated my daughter.

33:53.857 --> 33:56.295
No, Antonio.
Are you listening to yourself?

33:56.295 --> 33:58.340
I would never--
- No, no, no!

33:58.340 --> 34:00.429
Be honest.

34:00.429 --> 34:05.043
The things I've done for you,
the things that I've seen.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.088
I know all your lies.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.698
I am your lies!

34:10.309 --> 34:14.791
No, I want
to hear you say it, Paulo.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.359
Say it!

34:17.359 --> 34:20.319
Say it.

34:20.319 --> 34:22.147
I'm a competitor, Antonio.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.453
<i>Babaca.</i>

34:24.453 --> 34:25.628
She's only a child!

34:25.628 --> 34:28.805
She is a woman,
a beautiful woman!

34:28.805 --> 34:31.025
She wanted to have sex
more than I did!

34:32.244 --> 34:34.550
- Boom.
- Got him.

34:34.550 --> 34:36.552
<i>Antonio.</i>

34:36.552 --> 34:38.815
She came on to me, bro!

34:38.815 --> 34:41.514
You should be proud of her.
She knows what she wants.

34:51.611 --> 34:54.135
Whoa, Antonio.
What the hell are you doing?

34:54.135 --> 34:57.095
<i>There's a hole
in your heart, Paulo.</i>

34:57.095 --> 34:59.967
Always has been.

34:59.967 --> 35:04.189
You try to fill it
with fame and money

35:04.189 --> 35:05.451
and women,

35:05.451 --> 35:08.323
but it only grows larger.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.195
Antonio, please.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.240
Let's--

35:12.240 --> 35:13.546
- Shots fired!
- Let's go!

35:18.464 --> 35:22.032
Jesus Christ, what the
hell is wrong with you?

35:22.032 --> 35:24.905
- Drop the gun, Antonio.
- Now!

35:26.124 --> 35:27.777
Give me the gun.
That's it.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.953
Why are you here?
What is it?

35:29.953 --> 35:32.217
Paulo Rocha,

35:32.217 --> 35:34.958
you're under arrest
for sexual assault of a minor.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.873
I'm under arrest?

35:36.873 --> 35:38.266
He just shot at me.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.270
Antonio, do something.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.142
I already have.

35:47.623 --> 35:50.060
That's right.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.106
When you're alone at night,

35:52.106 --> 35:53.673
thinking about everything

35:53.673 --> 35:55.675
that's been taken away
from you,

35:55.675 --> 35:59.418
remember it was because of me.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.506
I did this.

36:00.506 --> 36:01.942
Come on.
Let's go.

36:04.423 --> 36:06.773
Where'd you get the gun,
Antonio?

36:06.773 --> 36:10.298
That corner
of his bedroom closet.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.692
In an old shoebox.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.346
How did you know
it was there?

36:16.391 --> 36:18.959
I was the one
who hid it for him.

36:27.097 --> 36:30.188
<i>She is a woman,
a beautiful woman!</i>

36:30.188 --> 36:32.538
<i>She wanted to have sex
more than I did!</i>

36:32.538 --> 36:34.627
My friend betrayed me, so...

36:34.627 --> 36:37.804
Ana was 16.
You're looking at an E felony.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.154
So you're facing
four years in prison

36:40.154 --> 36:41.808
as a registered sex offender.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.724
And you know how much they
love that on the cell block.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.073
Hold on.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.814
You got no witnesses

36:47.814 --> 36:49.946
and a "victim" who testified

36:49.946 --> 36:52.166
to being crazy in love
with my client--

36:52.166 --> 36:54.734
All right,
I'm gonna stop you right there.

36:54.734 --> 36:59.086
Your client admitted
to having sex with a minor.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.044
You really want
to take this to trial?

37:03.656 --> 37:07.181
Paulo pleads sexual
misconduct, no jail time.

37:07.181 --> 37:09.183
A misdemeanor?
That's not happening.

37:09.183 --> 37:13.361
The charge is rape three, period.

37:13.361 --> 37:16.451
Can't swat that away,
can you?

37:16.451 --> 37:18.932
God damn, Antonio.
I trusted that man with my li--

37:18.932 --> 37:22.240
And then you raped
his teenage daughter!

37:24.894 --> 37:26.766
I need some time alone
with my client.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.855
Be careful what you wish for.

37:40.127 --> 37:42.521
Paulo left that
poor family shattered, huh?

37:42.521 --> 37:44.827
They're gonna try to put
the pieces back together,

37:44.827 --> 37:46.394
go to counseling.

37:46.394 --> 37:49.136
Carisi's only charging Antonio
with reckless endangerment,

37:49.136 --> 37:51.269
which means
he'll get probation.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.401
Marcía was just trying
to keep it all together.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.142
I wonder what she's gonna do
with all the money

37:55.142 --> 37:56.361
'cause it's not like
she needed the cash.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.537
Well, she told Ana
it was for college.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.278
There'll be plenty more
where that came from

38:00.278 --> 38:01.888
if she ever decides to sue.

38:01.888 --> 38:05.108
Well, I'm going to see Ana
now, so good night, everyone.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.414
Good night.

38:06.414 --> 38:07.981
You good?

38:07.981 --> 38:10.505
I know it's hard to see
your heroes turn into villains.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.377
That guy was a villain
all along.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.074
Hmm.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.728
Hey, I got you something.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.425
Why?

38:17.425 --> 38:18.426
Oh!

38:18.426 --> 38:19.601
So you can learn
how to kick

38:19.601 --> 38:21.342
before you crap
on my national pastime.

38:21.342 --> 38:22.996
Uh-huh.

38:22.996 --> 38:24.650
Oh, look at you.
You're good.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.913
Oh, wow, you're a natural.
- OK, you know what?

38:26.913 --> 38:28.523
Go long, then.
Go on.

38:28.523 --> 38:29.829
Whoa, easy.

38:29.829 --> 38:31.265
I'ma stick to real football.

38:31.265 --> 38:32.658
What are you talking about?
This is real fútbol.

38:32.658 --> 38:35.008
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Good night, Velasco.

38:38.316 --> 38:43.277
So Paulo is gonna
plead guilty to rape three.

38:43.277 --> 38:47.629
No jail time, but he's
gonna do 10 years' probation

38:47.629 --> 38:49.501
and go on the registry.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.677
He didn't rape me.
I wanted him.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.113
OK. I know, Ana.

38:53.113 --> 38:56.116
I know that you think that,

38:56.116 --> 38:59.728
but men like Paulo are experts

38:59.728 --> 39:02.340
at grooming girls your age.

39:02.340 --> 39:07.040
And according to the law, Ana,
what he did to you was rape.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.433
And there's a reason for that.

39:08.433 --> 39:12.132
It's to keep predators away
from young people.

39:12.132 --> 39:15.483
Also to give you time, right?

39:15.483 --> 39:17.398
A little bit of breathing room.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.618
Time for what?

39:19.618 --> 39:21.663
Being bored to death?

39:23.404 --> 39:27.408
Time to figure things out
on your own.

39:27.408 --> 39:31.804
You know that adult men
have more power.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.196
They have more experience.

39:33.196 --> 39:35.634
And in this case,
they have more ego.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.768
You want to talk about ego?

39:39.768 --> 39:44.207
Boys my age only care about
getting wasted and partying.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.426
Well, it sounds like

39:45.426 --> 39:48.560
you're meeting
the wrong kind of boys.

39:48.560 --> 39:53.565
Look, at 17, you just don't
know what you think you know.

39:53.565 --> 39:58.265
With a little bit of time
and perspective,

39:58.265 --> 40:00.354
you're gonna look back at this

40:00.354 --> 40:03.749
and see the whole thing
so differently

40:03.749 --> 40:06.186
and so clearly.

40:06.186 --> 40:07.535
And I know that.

40:07.535 --> 40:11.583
Believe me,
because I've been there.

40:15.587 --> 40:17.110
You'll see.
