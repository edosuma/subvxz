WEBVTT

00:08.672 --> 00:14.880
AND IF YOU GAZE LONG INTO AN ABYSS,
THE ABYSS ALSO GAZES INTO YOU.

00:24.838 --> 00:29.463
JUNE 21, 1921

01:03.963 --> 01:05.213
The beginning

01:06.172 --> 01:07.672
and the end.

01:10.630 --> 01:12.713
A strange idea

01:13.338 --> 01:15.172
that both should be the same.

01:17.213 --> 01:19.255
<i>Sic mundus creatus est.</i>

01:21.172 --> 01:23.088
Thus the world was created.

01:35.172 --> 01:36.380
<i>Sic</i>

01:36.463 --> 01:38.338
<i>mundus</i>

01:38.422 --> 01:40.463
<i>creatus est!</i>

01:54.588 --> 01:56.838
You no longer believe the prophecy?

02:01.547 --> 02:03.547
I believe in the irony of fate.

02:10.130 --> 02:14.672
Adam says that all things must happen
as they've always happened.

02:15.755 --> 02:18.838
We have to bear the cross,
no matter how heavy it seems.

02:18.922 --> 02:22.338
In six days paradise begins
and hell on earth will end.

02:22.922 --> 02:24.422
Sometimes I wonder

02:25.047 --> 02:26.963
if paradise and hell

02:27.755 --> 02:29.505
are not one and the same thing.

02:32.338 --> 02:33.713
Adam was right.

02:35.505 --> 02:37.047
You've lost faith.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.713
Is that why he sent you?

02:48.713 --> 02:50.797
I've waited a long time for this moment.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.963
It's interesting that it's you.

03:04.838 --> 03:06.838
I hope that the day comes

03:07.588 --> 03:10.338
when you don't believe
everything Adam tells you.

03:11.463 --> 03:12.463
Ask him...

03:13.422 --> 03:15.130
why he took you in.

03:16.838 --> 03:18.880
And why he called you Noah.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.672
JUNE 27, 2020
BEGINNING OF THE LAST CYCLE

04:35.880 --> 04:38.463
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

06:24.588 --> 06:26.588
I think we're a perfect match.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.672
Never believe anything else.

06:50.505 --> 06:54.255
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

07:20.047 --> 07:22.005
JUNE 2020

07:22.088 --> 07:23.672
27

09:48.088 --> 09:50.005
<i>My name is Claudia Tiedemann.</i>

09:50.088 --> 09:55.463
<i>I am one of the few survivors</i>
<i>of the apocalypse of June 27, 2020.</i>

09:55.547 --> 09:58.338
<i>Almost three months</i>
<i>have passed since the catastrophe.</i>

09:58.422 --> 10:02.505
<i>It's still unclear</i>
<i>what exactly led to the events in Winden.</i>

10:03.297 --> 10:04.755
<i>But the God Particle...</i>

10:05.505 --> 10:09.047
<i>If we can stabilize it,</i>
<i>maybe it is a way back.</i>

10:10.380 --> 10:11.963
<i>Back to the past.</i>

10:12.588 --> 10:14.630
<i>Maybe we can save them.</i>

10:14.713 --> 10:16.088
<i>All of them.</i>

10:20.797 --> 10:22.880
JUNE 21, 2020

10:22.963 --> 10:26.588
SIX DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

10:26.672 --> 10:28.255
<i>Wake up, late risers!</i>

10:28.338 --> 10:32.213
<i>It's the first week of summer vacation</i>
<i>and it is perfect beach weather.</i>

10:32.297 --> 10:33.297
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

10:33.755 --> 10:34.797
<i>Local news.</i>

10:34.880 --> 10:38.672
<i>Over six months after the mysterious</i>
<i>disappearance of four teenagers,</i>

10:38.755 --> 10:43.005
<i>a senior citizen and a local</i>
<i>police officer from the town of Winden,</i>

10:43.088 --> 10:47.755
<i>there are no clues as to their whereabouts</i>
<i>or the circumstances.</i>

10:47.838 --> 10:51.755
<i>A federal police task force</i>
<i>will now assist with the investigation.</i>

10:56.797 --> 10:58.213
How do you feel today?

10:59.297 --> 11:00.797
Still having joint trouble?

11:02.047 --> 11:03.213
Nausea?

11:04.380 --> 11:06.922
To be honest, your lab results worry me.

11:07.005 --> 11:08.963
We should treat you in the hospital again.

11:09.047 --> 11:09.922
No.

11:10.630 --> 11:12.213
Absolutely not.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.047
-I want to stay here.
-Fine.

11:15.130 --> 11:17.422
We'll wait for the next MRI results.

11:18.713 --> 11:22.338
We may have to switch
from hormone treatment back to chemo.

11:22.422 --> 11:24.713
MARTHA: COME TO THE BRIDGE.

11:27.297 --> 11:28.963
He that has eyes to see...

11:30.838 --> 11:32.713
and ears to hear...

11:33.547 --> 11:35.838
may convince himself that no mortal...

11:36.755 --> 11:38.547
can keep a secret.

11:39.297 --> 11:41.047
If his lips are silent,

11:41.630 --> 11:43.963
he chatters with his fingertips.

11:44.630 --> 11:47.172
Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.

11:48.755 --> 11:50.047
That was Freud.

11:50.630 --> 11:51.963
I'm Clausen,

11:52.588 --> 11:54.380
head of the Winden task force.

11:54.463 --> 11:58.422
Today I take charge of last year's
unsolved missing persons cases.

11:59.338 --> 12:02.922
The task force's aim
is to reopen these cases entirely,

12:03.005 --> 12:07.255
to review all evidence and clues
until we have unearthed the secrets

12:07.672 --> 12:11.422
that lie hidden below the surface.

12:13.130 --> 12:19.005
Recently, some of you should have received
summons for renewed interrogation.

12:19.088 --> 12:22.713
-Yes?
-You said "we." Who do you mean by that?

12:23.130 --> 12:24.755
Myself and Ms. Doppler,

12:24.838 --> 12:27.172
who is still assigned to these cases.

12:27.255 --> 12:28.713
That's no task force!

12:29.172 --> 12:33.463
Six people have been missing for months.
And that's what they send us?

12:33.547 --> 12:35.297
One person?

12:35.380 --> 12:37.505
And the woman who found nothing?

12:48.463 --> 12:49.588
Ten people

12:50.338 --> 12:55.088
who look at an elephant
from ten different angles

12:55.172 --> 12:57.630
will give ten different statements...

12:58.880 --> 13:01.338
about its shape and appearance.

13:02.463 --> 13:04.422
A single person

13:04.505 --> 13:08.755
who sees that same elephant
from those ten different perspectives...

13:09.630 --> 13:11.297
will be able

13:11.380 --> 13:13.672
to piece together those observations

13:13.755 --> 13:16.880
and to draw the only possible conclusion.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.797
My son is missing.

13:18.880 --> 13:22.713
The next time I need to find an elephant,
I'll let you know!

13:23.130 --> 13:24.297
Right!

13:26.838 --> 13:30.172
<i>Does your mom talk at home?</i>
<i>About the investigation, I mean.</i>

13:31.213 --> 13:32.422
Not to us.

13:34.297 --> 13:35.880
We sit around and wait.

13:36.547 --> 13:37.880
And nothing happens.

13:39.422 --> 13:41.422
We know as little as we did
eight months ago.

13:44.547 --> 13:47.213
Sometimes I think it'd be better
if they were dead.

13:51.255 --> 13:52.755
Don't say that.

14:13.797 --> 14:15.213
I have to go.

14:16.672 --> 14:18.088
Where to?

14:18.172 --> 14:20.505
To pick up Elisabeth at a friend's.

14:20.588 --> 14:22.672
I'll call you later, okay?

17:14.422 --> 17:16.838
I've been trying to reach you for days.

17:19.422 --> 17:20.922
A lot was going on.

17:24.838 --> 17:26.463
I wanted to talk to you.

17:28.963 --> 17:31.297
-I've wanted to for a long time.
-Save your breath.

17:33.838 --> 17:35.422
It's probably better that way.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.005
So...

17:43.088 --> 17:44.588
that's it then.

17:54.838 --> 17:56.172
Because of him?

17:57.505 --> 17:59.422
-Because of Jonas?
-What?

18:00.297 --> 18:02.047
What's that got to do with it?

18:02.755 --> 18:04.713
We hardly ever see each other.

18:05.380 --> 18:06.713
I don't know...

18:10.380 --> 18:11.630
You've changed.

18:12.505 --> 18:13.505
I...

18:15.755 --> 18:17.463
I feel like you're hiding something.

18:21.130 --> 18:24.213
-I don't know what's up with you.
-What's up with me?

18:24.880 --> 18:27.005
What the fuck? My mom is dying!

18:28.255 --> 18:29.505
And...

18:29.588 --> 18:32.297
-there's stuff I can't tell you.
-Why not?

18:32.380 --> 18:34.005
I just can't.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.713
Okay?

18:35.797 --> 18:38.297
If you knew the crap I'm going through...

18:38.380 --> 18:40.880
The crap you're going through?

18:41.422 --> 18:44.297
In case you forgot,
my father and brother have disappeared.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.838
My mom is crazy
and couldn't care less about me.

18:46.922 --> 18:50.005
And you want to tell me about your crap?

19:09.505 --> 19:10.922
It's better this way.

19:27.755 --> 19:30.672
FROM UNKNOWN SENDER:
THIS EVENING.

19:36.963 --> 19:39.338
Energy creates community.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.338
Nuclear power was, is,
and will remain the only alternative.

19:44.422 --> 19:45.672
Nothing is cheaper,

19:45.755 --> 19:47.588
safer, more reliable.

19:48.797 --> 19:51.672
But the outside world insists on progress.

19:55.297 --> 19:57.838
In six days our plant
will be decommissioned for good.

19:58.922 --> 20:02.672
This is a dramatic event for all of us.

20:03.838 --> 20:06.713
<i>I would like to thank you</i>
<i>for your loyalty.</i>

20:07.422 --> 20:11.005
<i>Without you the Winden nuclear power plant</i>
<i>as we know it</i>

20:11.088 --> 20:13.088
<i>could never have existed.</i>

20:13.172 --> 20:16.963
<i>Let us, during these last six days,</i>

20:17.047 --> 20:19.630
<i>fill it with life</i>
<i>in the spirit of the community.</i>

20:41.713 --> 20:44.588
Everything has been prepared for transport
as planned.

20:46.047 --> 20:47.463
And the demolition plans?

20:48.713 --> 20:52.380
Everything at ground level will be left
and become part of the greenfield.

20:52.463 --> 20:56.130
The radiation of the barrels
will be traced to the pool's previous use.

21:07.213 --> 21:09.380
PASSPORT

21:42.047 --> 21:43.213
Hello?

21:50.713 --> 21:52.130
Who are you?

21:53.338 --> 21:54.547
What do you want?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.713
Why do you have a key?

22:01.922 --> 22:03.297
It's my key.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.880
What do you mean, it's yours?

22:10.630 --> 22:13.338
I know it sounds like it makes no sense.

22:15.047 --> 22:16.380
But hear me out.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.422
Do you remember the yellow bike?

22:23.338 --> 22:25.922
The bike you and dad gave me
on my eighth birthday.

22:27.505 --> 22:29.755
I rode it into a ditch the very first day.

22:30.422 --> 22:32.463
I gashed my arm open. Here.

22:37.838 --> 22:38.838
Get out.

22:41.547 --> 22:42.672
Here.

22:48.797 --> 22:50.713
Dad was making pancakes here.

22:51.505 --> 22:54.130
He dropped the pan
and spilled the hot oil here.

22:57.213 --> 23:00.005
I vanished from your life six months ago.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.797
You found me over 33 years ago.

23:04.713 --> 23:06.630
I knew it was you right away.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.922
It was raining, remember?

23:09.588 --> 23:11.922
Grandpa and you wanted
to take me along in the car.

23:12.713 --> 23:15.338
You said it was still acid rain
because of Chernobyl.

23:16.713 --> 23:18.422
I was wearing my yellow coat.

23:25.588 --> 23:26.755
Mom.

23:29.172 --> 23:30.213
It's me.

23:40.505 --> 23:41.588
Jonas?

23:45.713 --> 23:47.963
But that's impossible.

24:06.088 --> 24:08.005
<i>There is no coincidence.</i>

24:09.172 --> 24:11.297
<i>Every path is predetermined.</i>

24:12.922 --> 24:15.630
<i>Everything happens when it must.</i>

24:16.713 --> 24:18.213
<i>At the right time.</i>

24:19.338 --> 24:20.755
<i>In the right place.</i>

24:22.755 --> 24:24.755
<i>As if the world was a carpet</i>

24:24.838 --> 24:28.380
<i>made up of an endless network</i>
<i>of endless threads.</i>

24:29.880 --> 24:32.088
<i>Each in its place.</i>

24:32.172 --> 24:33.380
CAVE ENTRANCE

24:34.713 --> 24:38.005
<i>But very few of us know</i>
<i>where the journey takes them.</i>

24:45.172 --> 24:46.963
You've taken your first step.

24:48.338 --> 24:50.380
Adam will be proud of you.

24:53.213 --> 24:55.005
I felt the same way.

24:56.505 --> 24:58.005
It will pass.

25:02.338 --> 25:03.630
Adam.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.588
Why did he take us in?

25:07.338 --> 25:09.713
Things are still hidden from you.

25:10.505 --> 25:12.713
But they will come to light.

25:12.797 --> 25:14.588
Bit by bit.

25:17.005 --> 25:18.880
When the time is right.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.547
How do we know what's right
and what's wrong?

25:26.547 --> 25:30.005
What is good and what is evil?

25:30.755 --> 25:33.297
By heeding our inner voice.

25:34.047 --> 25:38.838
By not following anyone else
but ourselves.

25:40.088 --> 25:44.713
Our true nature reveals itself not only
in our deeds but also in their purpose.

25:45.797 --> 25:47.047
I am you.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.922
I am your voice.

25:51.588 --> 25:53.505
Never forget that.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.088
Everything is connected.

25:57.255 --> 25:58.255
You.

25:59.338 --> 26:00.463
Me.

26:01.380 --> 26:02.797
The past.

26:04.838 --> 26:06.297
And the future.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.547
No, no!

26:27.547 --> 26:28.922
Stop!

26:29.838 --> 26:33.130
Who are you?
You are hiding it!

26:33.213 --> 26:35.088
There, behind the wall! We saw it!

26:35.172 --> 26:37.713
We followed the signal.

26:40.297 --> 26:41.963
Till the dead zone.

26:42.047 --> 26:43.963
You're hiding God!

26:44.047 --> 26:46.213
You mustn't hide God.

26:46.297 --> 26:47.880
He's not yours alone!

26:51.963 --> 26:53.713
You mustn't hide God.

26:53.797 --> 26:54.880
No!

27:11.630 --> 27:13.588
No one can enter the dead zone.

27:14.213 --> 27:16.213
Any attempt will be punished by death.

27:17.088 --> 27:18.255
Those are the rules.

27:20.838 --> 27:22.422
We are the future.

27:22.505 --> 27:24.463
<i>Sic mundus creatus est.</i>

27:24.547 --> 27:26.672
<i>Sic mundus creatus est.</i>

27:44.505 --> 27:45.922
Where were you?

27:52.547 --> 27:53.922
There's nothing out there.

27:57.213 --> 27:59.088
The passage is our only hope.

27:59.588 --> 28:01.172
The faithless are dead.

28:01.255 --> 28:03.672
The prophecy will come true,
the passage will open

28:03.755 --> 28:05.713
and we will be led into paradise.

28:06.672 --> 28:08.380
The faithless are dead?

28:09.463 --> 28:11.838
Everyone is dead, my family, my friends.

28:11.922 --> 28:14.755
Everyone dies in six days, in my time!

28:15.463 --> 28:17.213
I don't need your damn paradise.

28:17.297 --> 28:18.838
I just want to go home.

28:22.838 --> 28:25.213
What did they want behind the wall?

28:49.463 --> 28:52.255
Why did Mom keep it all?

28:52.338 --> 28:55.172
Great-Grandpa died ages ago.

28:56.047 --> 28:58.172
I think because it's the only thing

28:58.672 --> 29:00.838
that reminds her of her family.

29:00.922 --> 29:03.713
Some things are hard to let go of.

29:04.380 --> 29:07.380
It's a shame
I never met Grandpa and Grandma.

29:09.463 --> 29:11.213
Does Mom remember them?

29:12.380 --> 29:16.088
Your mother was still little
when they died.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.630
Come on.

29:47.422 --> 29:49.047
<i>Were you born here?</i>

29:49.130 --> 29:50.630
<i>My grandfather was.</i>

29:51.422 --> 29:53.297
I grew up with him.

29:54.588 --> 29:56.213
Is your grandfather still alive?

29:57.338 --> 29:58.463
No.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.630
Have you thought it could have been him?

30:01.713 --> 30:04.088
-Who? My grandfather?
-No.

30:04.505 --> 30:05.922
Your colleague, Ulrich.

30:06.463 --> 30:07.463
No.

30:08.088 --> 30:09.297
Why?

30:09.838 --> 30:11.880
He called you shortly before he vanished.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.213
The call lasted exactly 12 seconds.

30:15.797 --> 30:17.630
Probably a voicemail message.

30:18.255 --> 30:19.755
What did he want?

30:20.755 --> 30:21.963
Nothing.

30:22.505 --> 30:23.922
He misdialed.

30:25.297 --> 30:27.047
Do you still have the message?

30:27.963 --> 30:29.088
No.

30:29.797 --> 30:31.380
Of course not.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.713
These are the parents' statements.

30:43.255 --> 30:44.463
Thanks, Wöller.

30:48.505 --> 30:49.505
You're welcome.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.213
I had an office set up for you.

31:07.797 --> 31:09.213
Just down the hall.

31:13.630 --> 31:16.005
Disappointments are the result
of false expectations.

31:16.838 --> 31:20.713
"Have hope," my mom always said,
"and no expectations,

31:20.797 --> 31:24.255
then you might get a miracle
and not a disappointment."

31:30.713 --> 31:32.630
Maybe you expected someone different

31:33.213 --> 31:34.630
and got me.

31:34.713 --> 31:35.838
Coincidence?

31:36.797 --> 31:38.422
I don't believe in coincidence.

31:38.505 --> 31:41.463
I think things come together
because they belong together.

31:53.338 --> 31:54.963
Shall we?

32:05.755 --> 32:06.838
Mom?

32:59.880 --> 33:01.505
INVESTIGATION FILE

33:09.963 --> 33:12.088
STEEL DOOR?

33:40.880 --> 33:43.338
<i>It's remarkable people don't crack,</i>

33:43.797 --> 33:47.172
<i>given the futility of their own existence.</i>

33:48.588 --> 33:52.422
An endless cycle of life and death.

33:54.088 --> 33:57.838
Where is the origin of all this suffering?

34:01.297 --> 34:03.338
Did you tell Bartosz?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.922
And he didn't get at all suspicious?

34:15.130 --> 34:17.380
He has always been naive by nature.

34:30.755 --> 34:34.213
The apocalypse has to happen.

34:36.797 --> 34:38.588
Are you having doubts?

34:42.005 --> 34:45.588
What do you do with an old forest
so new trees can grow?

34:46.172 --> 34:48.005
You burn it down.

34:48.838 --> 34:50.630
There isn't much time left.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.588
The missing pages...

34:55.213 --> 34:56.880
you must find them.

35:02.422 --> 35:03.713
Adam?

35:04.463 --> 35:05.963
They're waiting for you.

35:11.338 --> 35:12.922
Six more days.

36:50.672 --> 36:52.130
I'm on my break.

37:01.297 --> 37:04.588
Oh, well... Blow job 40 euros, anal 85.

37:04.672 --> 37:07.588
Kinky stuff costs extra.
But I need to eat first.

37:11.213 --> 37:12.338
Get undressed.

37:25.380 --> 37:27.880
You could say I exist infinitely.

37:29.005 --> 37:30.547
I'm here now.

37:31.422 --> 37:34.338
And I'm in every second
between my birth and my death.

37:35.547 --> 37:36.838
I'm always Jonas.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.213
I'm the same.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.672
And yet not the same.

37:41.755 --> 37:45.422
Like you're not the same person
who came through that door an hour ago.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.130
But where is Jonas?

37:49.463 --> 37:50.922
Where is my Jonas?

37:54.463 --> 37:55.963
He's in the future.

37:57.380 --> 37:59.005
In the future?

38:00.672 --> 38:01.713
Yes.

38:03.213 --> 38:04.797
But he can't come back.

38:05.463 --> 38:08.380
I tried to destroy the passage,
but I only closed it.

38:09.088 --> 38:10.755
That's why he's still there.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.755
Why are you here?

38:30.838 --> 38:34.672
To put an end to it all.
Once and for all.

39:22.297 --> 39:23.547
That's the man!

39:23.630 --> 39:25.422
Which man?

39:25.505 --> 39:29.547
The man with the watch. That's Noah!

39:30.047 --> 39:31.172
Noah?

39:55.963 --> 39:58.297
POLICE

39:58.380 --> 40:02.255
Watch out for the tiniest deviations
in their statements.

40:02.338 --> 40:03.713
Every detail is important.

40:10.088 --> 40:12.088
PETER: I'VE FOUND NOAH.
COME TO THE BUNKER.

40:12.172 --> 40:13.713
Something wrong?

40:16.005 --> 40:17.422
I have to go.

40:18.297 --> 40:20.005
I don't have a driver's license.

40:20.088 --> 40:22.505
I assume it's okay
if I ride with you tomorrow?

40:22.588 --> 40:23.672
Yes.

41:24.922 --> 41:26.297
Mom didn't lock it.

41:27.338 --> 41:28.588
What's that?

41:29.630 --> 41:30.797
Dad's stuff.

41:32.755 --> 41:36.130
Police documents and maps of the cave.

41:37.547 --> 41:39.505
That's why Mom goes in there every day.

41:42.213 --> 41:43.838
I think she's looking for this.

41:51.713 --> 41:54.588
A door. In the caves?

41:56.297 --> 41:58.088
It goes to the nuclear power plant.

41:59.672 --> 42:02.505
They all know something
we're not supposed to know.

42:02.588 --> 42:04.005
Mom, Bartosz.

42:04.088 --> 42:05.463
The police.

42:10.547 --> 42:12.838
Each with their own shitty secret.

42:53.505 --> 42:54.630
Are you ready?

43:26.547 --> 43:28.088
Thanks for the coffee.

43:44.588 --> 43:46.630
I'm glad to get rid of that thing.

43:58.088 --> 44:00.588
Call Mom again. Okay?

44:18.463 --> 44:19.588
Bye.

44:21.880 --> 44:23.005
Bye.

45:05.630 --> 45:07.047
That's Noah.

45:10.838 --> 45:13.588
Elisabeth found it, at the store.

45:14.505 --> 45:15.755
It was in a book.

45:16.422 --> 45:18.797
She said that's the man
who gave her the watch.

45:21.797 --> 45:24.547
"January 8, 1921.

45:24.630 --> 45:28.463
<i>Sic mundus creatus est."</i>

45:28.547 --> 45:31.338
Charlotte, who are these people?

45:32.213 --> 45:34.213
Why did your grandfather have this?

45:34.297 --> 45:35.672
I don't know.

46:00.797 --> 46:01.672
CALL REJECTED

50:10.088 --> 50:13.130
