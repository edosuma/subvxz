00:13.706 --> 00:15.205
David, it's me again.

00:15.273 --> 00:18.504
I think I'm being followed.
I need to see you now.

00:18.572 --> 00:20.073
Call me when you get this.

00:27.326 --> 00:28.963
GIRL:
Daddy!

00:29.030 --> 00:30.030
Daddy!

00:30.098 --> 00:32.734
- Hey!
- Hey, guys. How are you?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.413
(motorcycle engine revving)

00:44.225 --> 00:45.593
(gun cocking)

00:45.661 --> 00:47.965
No! No! No!

- Bacon.

01:49.644 --> 01:51.779
- Third time this week.
- Mm-hmm.

01:51.846 --> 01:54.181
When is the last time you got
your cholesterol checked?

01:54.249 --> 01:56.951
- Last month.
- What is it, 250, 275?

01:57.018 --> 01:58.886
Not even close.

01:58.954 --> 02:01.029
If you're at 300,
I'm interviewing new partners.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.831
Sorry, pal,
you are stuck with me.

Genetically gifted-- 170.

02:05.435 --> 02:08.472
Bacon is my friend.

02:08.538 --> 02:11.375
Have you guys seen Deeks?

02:11.443 --> 02:12.810
Uh, good morning to you, too.

02:12.877 --> 02:14.611
Hi. Have you heard from him?

02:14.679 --> 02:15.712
It's only 9:00.

02:15.780 --> 02:17.247
I know, but he was supposed
to pick me up

02:17.315 --> 02:18.748
at the airport this morning
and he ever showed.

02:18.816 --> 02:20.383
That's right.
How was Hawaii?

02:20.451 --> 02:21.851
It was fine.

02:21.919 --> 02:24.788
Meet anyone? Go to any luaus?
Solve any crimes?

02:24.856 --> 02:26.257
It was fine.
Back to Deeks.

02:26.325 --> 02:28.693
I called his house number,
I called his cell.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.894
No answer anywhere.

02:29.962 --> 02:31.562
He's probably just hungover.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.899
Or surfing.
Or he forgot.

02:33.967 --> 02:35.100
Or all of the above.

02:35.168 --> 02:36.402
(sighs)

02:36.469 --> 02:38.904
He has flaked on me before,
and I suppose he does

02:38.972 --> 02:41.207
sleep through his alarm
on a regular basis.

02:41.275 --> 02:42.375
So, yeah,

02:42.443 --> 02:43.910
you guys are right.
Of course.

02:43.978 --> 02:45.745
- What you eating?
- Bacon, eggs, mine.

02:45.813 --> 02:47.780
Really?

02:47.848 --> 02:49.082
That's it?

02:49.149 --> 02:50.750
No phone calls to the
hospital or the morgue?

02:50.818 --> 02:52.985
I mean, I could be lying
in a ditch someplace.

02:53.053 --> 02:54.086
(chuckles)

02:54.154 --> 02:55.621
You slept here?

02:55.689 --> 02:58.457
Yeah, well, it's more
of a tactical retreat,

02:58.525 --> 03:00.826
because my building is being
tented for termites.

03:00.894 --> 03:02.194
Termites or fleas?

03:02.262 --> 03:03.495
KENSI: Yeah, now that
you mention it,

03:03.563 --> 03:05.832
Monty has been looking
kind of mangy.

03:05.899 --> 03:08.167
You ever thought about taking
that dog to a groomer?

03:08.235 --> 03:09.702
Maybe get that
fur problem checked out?

03:09.770 --> 03:11.671
He's actually there right now,
and the fur problem

03:11.739 --> 03:13.607
you're referring to is actually
called a shaggy cut.

03:13.675 --> 03:16.110
I pay top dollar for that
at the Pampered Pooch.

03:16.178 --> 03:18.947
Are we talking about
you or your dog?

03:19.015 --> 03:20.883
(bird call honking)

03:22.286 --> 03:25.555
The mating call for
the African Red-Throated Loon.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.023
Audubon Society

03:27.091 --> 03:28.525
membership has its privileges.

03:28.592 --> 03:29.593
Does it?

03:31.529 --> 03:33.631
We've got an urgent case.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.068
CALLEN:
You need some deodorant.

03:37.136 --> 03:39.404
About that ride,
shaggy boy.

03:39.472 --> 03:40.739
Hey, how was Hawaii?

03:40.807 --> 03:41.807
No, no, no.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.408
Don't change the subject.

03:43.476 --> 03:44.839
You're going to punish
me for this, aren't you?

03:44.864 --> 03:45.978
Hell, yeah.

03:45.979 --> 03:47.347
Because you left me

03:47.414 --> 03:50.149
stranded at the airport,
I believe I get to be

03:50.217 --> 03:51.885
master of the
car radio today.

03:51.952 --> 03:54.288
Dear God, no-- not that
techno station again.

03:54.355 --> 03:57.124
Reminds me of college
with all those foam parties

03:57.192 --> 04:00.795
and strawberry-flavored
body glitter.

04:00.863 --> 04:03.332
Shooting in Santa Monica
yesterday at 1400.

04:03.399 --> 04:06.068
Victim is Stephanie Walters,
32 years old.

04:06.136 --> 04:09.072
She was a former Navy
Intelligence officer.

04:09.140 --> 04:10.674
Retired three years ago.

04:10.741 --> 04:14.478
Lived with her fiancé,
Clifford Bosworth.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.248
I'm searching income tax records
for a more recent employer.

04:17.315 --> 04:18.382
Any video footage?

04:18.450 --> 04:19.651
Just about every
storefront camera

04:19.718 --> 04:21.152
caught a piece
of the action.

04:23.222 --> 04:26.190
The victim had
just left a café.

04:26.258 --> 04:28.659
She had nowhere to run.

04:29.829 --> 04:31.663
KENSI:
He took her purse.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.132
Looks like robbery
may have been the motive.

04:34.199 --> 04:36.000
That was part one.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.268
This is part two.

04:40.338 --> 04:43.373
The shooter managed to get away,

04:43.441 --> 04:44.974
but the rider, Jose Agosto,

04:45.042 --> 04:46.275
died on impact.

04:46.343 --> 04:48.977
Agosto was 25 years old

04:49.045 --> 04:50.879
and had just about as
many arrests.

04:50.947 --> 04:53.281
He did time
for armed robbery

04:53.349 --> 04:55.383
and was your average
muscle for hire.

04:55.451 --> 04:57.418
Sounds like a job for the LAPD.

04:57.486 --> 05:01.689
Stephanie Walters made a call
before she was shot.

05:01.756 --> 05:05.659
It was to her former boss--
Commander David Forbes,

05:05.727 --> 05:07.628
at the Office
of Naval Intelligence.

05:07.696 --> 05:08.863
Right.

05:08.931 --> 05:11.766
Check Agosto's
known associates.

05:11.834 --> 05:13.468
You two talk to
Commander Forbes.

05:13.536 --> 05:14.936
We'll talk with
Stephanie's fiancé.

05:15.004 --> 05:16.305
Eric, send us the address.

05:16.372 --> 05:18.273
You got it.

05:18.341 --> 05:20.776
- Oh, and Mr. Deeks--
- Yeah.

05:20.844 --> 05:23.846
that blanket that you took
from my office--

05:23.914 --> 05:27.517
Mm-hmm.
actually it's a tapestry

05:27.585 --> 05:30.321
that once hung in
Mozart's home in Salzburg.

05:30.388 --> 05:31.589
That explains why
it smelled so musty.

05:31.656 --> 05:33.191
You want me to
dry-clean it for you?

05:33.258 --> 05:35.760
Really? Really, Deeks?

05:37.898 --> 05:40.166
Can I... hand-wash it,
cold water?

05:40.233 --> 05:43.436
No? Okay.

05:43.504 --> 05:45.338
Yeah, I need a do-over
on today.

05:45.406 --> 05:48.074
There are no do-overs
in life, Mr. Deeks.

05:48.142 --> 05:51.460
This coming from a woman
with a dozen aliases.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.685
I heard that!

05:53.014 --> 05:54.315
(groans)

05:54.382 --> 05:56.450
Stephanie called me out
of the blue yesterday morning.

05:56.518 --> 05:58.352
She said it was urgent,
so we made plans

05:58.420 --> 05:59.654
to meet in
the afternoon.

05:59.721 --> 06:01.923
She called you again right
before she was killed?

06:01.990 --> 06:03.291
I was in a meeting.

06:03.358 --> 06:04.658
She said she
was being followed,

06:04.726 --> 06:06.493
but, by the time
I got the message,

06:06.561 --> 06:07.694
it was too late.

06:07.762 --> 06:09.496
Any idea who could've
been after her?

06:09.564 --> 06:11.999
We hadn't spoken
in over six months.

06:12.066 --> 06:13.266
I really don't know.

06:13.334 --> 06:15.168
How long did Stephanie
work under you?

06:15.236 --> 06:19.473
Four years-- as an electronic
intelligence operations analyst.

06:19.541 --> 06:21.542
She was one of the best--
bright, thorough,

06:21.610 --> 06:23.210
great sense of humor too.

06:23.278 --> 06:24.812
Why did she leave?

06:24.879 --> 06:27.782
Like a lot of good agents,
she burned out.

06:27.849 --> 06:29.817
We had a grueling
operation in Serbia.

06:29.885 --> 06:31.920
I could see it was taking
a toll on her.

06:31.987 --> 06:33.988
Any idea what Stephanie
did after she resigned?

06:34.056 --> 06:36.023
Stephanie had a big heart.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.326
Six months after she left,
she joined a non-profit

06:38.393 --> 06:39.860
that set up safe drinking water

06:39.928 --> 06:42.263
for people in Third World countries.
Wow.

06:42.330 --> 06:43.631
Maybe one of her

06:43.699 --> 06:46.134
past assignments had something
to do with her murder.

06:46.201 --> 06:48.069
I wondered the same thing.

06:48.137 --> 06:50.305
She had top secret
security clearance

06:50.372 --> 06:52.206
and access to a lot
of information.

06:52.274 --> 06:54.476
Could this be related
to selling that intel?

06:54.543 --> 06:55.910
Never.

06:55.978 --> 06:57.712
Not the Stephanie I knew.

07:22.071 --> 07:23.138
Cliff Bosworth?

07:24.974 --> 07:27.443
Yeah. Who are you?

07:27.510 --> 07:31.614
Agent Callen, NCIS.

07:31.681 --> 07:34.016
Agent Hanna.

07:35.051 --> 07:37.853
The police just left.

07:37.921 --> 07:40.055
They took photos,
dusted for prints.

07:40.123 --> 07:41.557
Didn't find anything.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.227
We just want to ask you
a couple questions

07:44.294 --> 07:46.062
about your fiancée
Stephanie.

07:46.129 --> 07:49.165
What is there to say?
She's gone.

07:52.669 --> 07:54.237
We're sorry for your loss,

07:54.304 --> 07:56.105
but any information
you can give us

07:56.173 --> 07:57.873
may help us find her killer.

08:01.711 --> 08:06.381
I thought this must have been
just a random act of violence,

08:06.449 --> 08:08.783
until I came home and
found the place like this.

08:08.851 --> 08:10.384
Anything missing?

08:10.452 --> 08:12.053
Just her laptop.

08:12.121 --> 08:13.821
They must've been looking
for something else,

08:13.889 --> 08:15.823
'cause every room
in the place was trashed.

08:15.890 --> 08:19.159
Did Stephanie keep her valuables
anyplace special?

08:19.227 --> 08:21.294
Well, she's...

08:23.330 --> 08:24.831
Sorry. She...

08:26.067 --> 08:28.601
She was a minimalist.

08:28.669 --> 08:30.337
So the only

08:30.404 --> 08:32.405
material things she cherished

08:32.472 --> 08:34.307
were a necklace her
father gave her

08:34.375 --> 08:36.243
and the engagement ring from me.

08:36.311 --> 08:37.811
She was wearing both of them.

08:39.347 --> 08:42.182
Clownfish...

08:42.250 --> 08:43.450
they're hard to care for.

08:43.518 --> 08:44.985
CLIFF: That was
Stephanie's thing.

08:45.053 --> 08:47.588
She didn't even like me
going near the tank.

08:47.656 --> 08:49.457
I went to clean
it out the other day

08:49.524 --> 08:50.891
and she went
nuts about it.

08:50.959 --> 08:53.327
I mean, she just liked to do
things a certain way, you know.

08:58.834 --> 09:02.003
What-what are you doing?

09:04.974 --> 09:07.208
Think I got
something.

09:10.879 --> 09:12.513
CALLEN:
I've got gloves.

09:12.581 --> 09:14.849
Open it up.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.428
Singapore, Australia...

09:29.566 --> 09:33.769
Looks like there's a little more
to Stephanie than we thought.

09:45.478 --> 09:48.480
Any idea where she got the
fake passports and the cash?

09:48.548 --> 09:51.583
No.

09:51.651 --> 09:53.819
No, Stephanie and I talked
about everything.

09:55.369 --> 09:56.569
At least I thought we did.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.937
How long did you known her?

09:58.005 --> 10:00.940
She walked into my nursery
a year and a half ago.

10:01.008 --> 10:03.075
She said she wanted to
start a veggie garden.

10:03.143 --> 10:05.945
We, uh... we worked
on it together

10:06.013 --> 10:09.916
and things just kind of
developed from there, you know.

10:09.983 --> 10:11.212
What did Stephanie tell you
about the job...

10:11.216 --> 10:13.936
Nope. Nope. I'm not buying
this guy never got suspicious.

10:13.954 --> 10:15.621
His fiancée's leading
a double life.

10:15.689 --> 10:18.391
How do you not
realize something's up?

10:18.459 --> 10:21.027
Maybe she was good at it--

10:21.094 --> 10:22.795
like we are.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.398
Tell us about
Stephanie's job

10:25.465 --> 10:26.833
at Emerald Water
International.

10:26.900 --> 10:31.671
She loved to make a difference,
but the travel was rough.

10:31.738 --> 10:32.805
What was her last trip?

10:32.873 --> 10:34.273
Frankfurt, Germany.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.408
She got back three days ago.

10:36.476 --> 10:38.343
Anything unusual
when she got back?

10:39.345 --> 10:41.212
Yeah...

10:42.348 --> 10:43.514
Yeah, she seemed distracted.

10:43.582 --> 10:45.049
I asked her about the trip--

10:45.117 --> 10:46.618
she didn't want
to talk about it.

10:46.685 --> 10:48.086
She just...

10:49.088 --> 10:51.155
She just seemed
a bit off.

10:52.424 --> 10:53.758
At first I just thought

10:53.826 --> 10:56.193
it was the jet lag.
At first?

10:58.029 --> 11:00.097
She started getting phone calls
at odd times.

11:00.164 --> 11:02.432
She'd go into the other room
to take them, you know.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.766
I asked what was going on,

11:03.834 --> 11:06.603
she said she was just...
she said she was just tired.

11:06.670 --> 11:09.605
Then the day before yesterday,

11:09.673 --> 11:11.607
she left the house in a hurry,

11:11.674 --> 11:14.342
and, of course, I was worried,
so I followed her.

11:15.878 --> 11:17.479
She drove to a place
in Santa Monica.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.980
Some woman answered the door.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.818
Can you give us an address?

11:22.886 --> 11:25.656
Yeah, sure.

11:25.723 --> 11:26.990
Okay.

11:27.058 --> 11:29.527
I think he's telling the truth.

11:29.595 --> 11:31.396
I think Stephanie
was keeping secrets.

11:31.464 --> 11:33.131
So what was she
mixed up in?

11:33.199 --> 11:35.134
Well, she had access
to classified material

11:35.202 --> 11:36.535
up until three years ago.

11:36.603 --> 11:38.705
And she traveled a lot
under different passports.

11:38.772 --> 11:41.040
(computer trills)
ERIC: Guys, I followed up

11:41.107 --> 11:42.374
with the café Stephanie
visited--

11:42.442 --> 11:44.043
actually an Internet café.

11:44.110 --> 11:46.044
Turns out she uploaded files
to a cloud drive

11:46.112 --> 11:47.212
that belongs to Cliff.

11:47.279 --> 11:49.013
The account was opened
two months ago.

11:49.081 --> 11:50.248
What'd you find?

11:50.316 --> 11:51.483
Well, it's highly encrypted,

11:51.550 --> 11:52.917
and I'm working on it,

11:52.985 --> 11:56.353
but it might just be easier
to ask him for the password.

11:58.656 --> 12:01.324
We need access to your
cloud drive account.

12:01.392 --> 12:03.393
I haven't got
a cloud drive account.

12:04.662 --> 12:06.597
Stephanie uploaded files

12:06.664 --> 12:10.101
to an account held in your
name before she was killed.

12:10.168 --> 12:11.936
It was opened about
two months ago.

12:12.004 --> 12:13.137
The only thing she opened

12:13.205 --> 12:15.106
was something
to keep the wedding files in,

12:15.174 --> 12:16.274
but I never looked at it.

12:16.342 --> 12:17.709
Any idea what the password is?

12:17.777 --> 12:20.979
She never told me.

12:26.651 --> 12:29.586
I just checked
with Stephanie's old boss.

12:29.654 --> 12:32.089
Those passports were not issued
by his department.

12:32.157 --> 12:33.423
Somebody must've supplied them.

12:33.524 --> 12:34.891
What about her current employer?

12:34.959 --> 12:37.260
Emerald Water International is
a completely legit organization.

12:37.327 --> 12:39.195
They've helped set up
drinking water pumps

12:39.262 --> 12:40.362
in Third World countries

12:40.430 --> 12:41.697
for over ten years.

12:41.765 --> 12:43.299
- Do they have an office?
- Yeah.

12:43.367 --> 12:44.901
Downtown Culver City.

12:44.969 --> 12:46.903
Stephanie reported
to a woman named Abigail Johns.

12:46.971 --> 12:47.971
We're on it.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.809
Guys, I've been researching
Stephanie's movements.

12:52.877 --> 12:55.245
She was in Frankfurt
last week, like Cliff said,

12:55.313 --> 12:56.713
but it was just a layover.

12:56.781 --> 12:59.116
She ended up traveling on
to Afghanistan for the week.

12:59.184 --> 13:01.285
See if she was working
on a water project there.

13:01.353 --> 13:02.587
Right.

13:02.654 --> 13:04.322
Found our shooter yet?

13:04.390 --> 13:05.590
Uh, still looking.

13:05.658 --> 13:07.493
But you know that woman
Stephanie visited?

13:07.560 --> 13:09.595
Turns out she's a professor
of engineering

13:09.663 --> 13:11.364
at Whitley University.

13:11.432 --> 13:13.333
Dr. Calista Colby.

13:13.401 --> 13:16.170
Now, I got a campus
security log here.

13:16.237 --> 13:18.172
Stephanie visited her every day

13:18.240 --> 13:20.541
since she got back from
Afghanistan three days ago.

13:20.608 --> 13:23.144
She also placed half a dozen
calls to Dr. Colby.

13:23.211 --> 13:25.747
The last one was just 20 minutes
before her shooting.

13:25.815 --> 13:27.982
Well, you need engineers
to build water pumps.

13:28.050 --> 13:29.116
Could be a colleague.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.651
Or someone she trusts.

13:30.719 --> 13:33.988
Maybe she can tell us
what Stephanie was up to.

13:35.490 --> 13:37.492
(indistinct chatter)

13:39.595 --> 13:40.861
WOMAN:
Okay.

13:40.929 --> 13:42.362
Abigail Johns?

13:42.430 --> 13:44.998
Can I help you?

13:45.066 --> 13:47.000
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.334
Detective Marty Deeks, LAPD.

13:48.401 --> 13:50.636
We'd like to talk to you
about Stephanie Walters.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.937
Is she okay?

13:52.005 --> 13:54.639
Um, I'm sorry to have
to deliver the news.

13:54.707 --> 13:56.641
She was actually shot and killed
yesterday.

13:56.709 --> 13:58.843
Oh, my God!
It would really help us out

13:58.911 --> 14:00.311
if you could answer
a few questions.

14:00.379 --> 14:01.980
Of course. Anything.

14:02.048 --> 14:04.049
Can you tell us about
your work in Afghanistan?

14:04.116 --> 14:05.217
Afghanistan?

14:05.285 --> 14:07.386
Oh, we don't work
in Afghanistan.

14:07.454 --> 14:09.488
Is it possible that Stephanie
joined a project that

14:09.556 --> 14:10.523
you didn't know about?

14:10.590 --> 14:12.492
Not with our organization.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.128
We haven't expanded
into the Middle East yet.

14:15.196 --> 14:17.364
But she was there on a water
project only last week.

14:17.432 --> 14:20.368
Oh, I'm sorry, Stephanie hasn't
worked for Emerald Water

14:20.435 --> 14:22.169
for... six months.

14:25.607 --> 14:27.608
(sighs)

14:45.092 --> 14:47.093
G.

15:00.341 --> 15:01.341
The body's still warm.

15:01.409 --> 15:03.377
Looks like a gunshot
wound to the chest.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.378
ERIC (on phone):
Yo.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.680
Eric, Dr. Colby's been shot.

15:06.748 --> 15:08.015
Notify LAPD,

15:08.083 --> 15:09.850
and have the campus
locked down.

15:09.918 --> 15:11.252
Got a passport.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.356
Departure stamp-- Kabul
International Airport;

15:14.423 --> 15:16.258
dated three days ago.

15:16.326 --> 15:18.761
- Three days ago?
- Yeah.

15:18.828 --> 15:20.528
That's the same day Stephanie
left Afghanistan.

15:20.596 --> 15:22.030
And now they're both dead.

15:22.098 --> 15:23.631
So what were
an engineering professor

15:23.699 --> 15:25.967
and a former intelligence agent
doing together in Kabul?

15:26.034 --> 15:29.603
Maybe he knows something.

15:32.706 --> 15:35.908
Any leads on Dr. Colby's killer?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.910
Campus is shut down
and being swept.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.012
I'm just waiting to get
their security footage.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.347
In the meantime,

15:41.414 --> 15:43.850
we were able to access
Dr. Colby's bank account.

15:43.917 --> 15:47.254
She received a wire transfer
for $50,000 two weeks ago.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.588
Strangely enough,

15:48.656 --> 15:50.991
Stephanie received the same
amount on the same day.

15:51.059 --> 15:52.226
That's big lump sum payments.

15:52.294 --> 15:53.227
Same source?

15:53.295 --> 15:54.829
It didn't appear
to be at first,

15:54.897 --> 15:56.765
but we traced the funds through
several shell corporations

15:56.832 --> 15:59.067
and found both
wires originated

15:59.135 --> 16:00.235
in the same Swiss bank.

16:00.303 --> 16:02.237
Do we have any idea
who's paying?

16:02.305 --> 16:05.908
Yes. A man named Larry Basser.

16:05.975 --> 16:07.142
He's a former NSA agent.

16:07.209 --> 16:08.410
Any ties to Afghanistan?

16:08.477 --> 16:09.778
He's been all over
the Middle East.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.647
Joined the NSA after a career
in the Army.

16:12.715 --> 16:14.983
ERIC: Spent lots of time in
Russia in the early '80s.

16:15.050 --> 16:16.651
He settled down in L.A.

16:16.718 --> 16:18.880
He's got memberships
to three yacht clubs

16:18.905 --> 16:20.105
and two country clubs.

16:20.289 --> 16:22.624
Wait a second.

16:27.063 --> 16:29.565
DEEKS: Uh, is that who
I think it is with Basser?

16:32.870 --> 16:34.804
Hetty?

16:46.310 --> 16:48.244
(gun firing)

16:48.331 --> 16:50.333
(shell casings clinking)

16:58.883 --> 17:02.786
Basser and I worked
together in the '80s.

17:02.853 --> 17:07.223
He was a courageous soldier
and a first class agent,

17:07.291 --> 17:10.594
but he considered himself
somewhat of a maverick,

17:10.661 --> 17:14.196
which is to say that
he ruffled a lot of feathers.

17:14.265 --> 17:16.199
I know the type.

17:16.266 --> 17:18.534
So that's why you wanted us
on the case.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.169
You knew Basser was involved.

17:20.236 --> 17:22.503
I didn't know for certain.

17:22.571 --> 17:24.506
Did you use us to do
your leg work?

17:24.574 --> 17:26.374
You have longer legs.

17:26.442 --> 17:27.909
Why'd Basser leave the NSA?

17:27.977 --> 17:30.913
He was ousted when a, uh, a case

17:30.981 --> 17:33.516
he was running in Fallujah
ended tragically.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.218
How tragically?

17:35.286 --> 17:38.555
Several agents were killed.

17:38.623 --> 17:41.525
Many believed
Basser was to blame.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.327
Do you believe that?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.229
I believe war is very messy,

17:45.297 --> 17:47.531
and unless you're
in the middle of it,

17:47.599 --> 17:49.500
it's easy
to point the finger.

17:49.567 --> 17:52.902
Hmm. So what's he
been doing since?

17:52.970 --> 17:56.372
Last I heard, he was running
a private intelligence network.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.340
So let's pay him a visit.

17:58.407 --> 18:00.342
Not so fast, Mr. Callen.

18:00.409 --> 18:03.912
Basser is
the ultimate lone wolf,

18:03.979 --> 18:07.081
and he's a tricky
bastard at that.

18:07.149 --> 18:11.486
He is extremely good
at what he does.

18:11.554 --> 18:13.288
You won't get through the door.

18:13.355 --> 18:14.956
I will.

18:15.024 --> 18:18.026
And I'll remember to
leave it unlocked for you.

18:26.270 --> 18:29.272
(thermos and cup clattering)

18:34.044 --> 18:36.980
What the hell is that?

18:37.048 --> 18:38.348
It's kale lemonade.

18:38.416 --> 18:39.650
You should have some.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.319
Scrape out that bacon
grease from breakfast.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.389
No, thank you.

18:47.726 --> 18:48.993
It's fresh.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.597
Made it with my new
four-in-one juicer.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.265
How much do you spend every year

18:53.333 --> 18:55.066
on late-night
infomercial purchases?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.901
You got the upside-down
tomato grower.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.070
You got the crystal bulbs
that water your plants.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.972
You got the ginzu knife
that can cut through glass.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.941
All necessities.
And, of course, the Chillow--

19:03.009 --> 19:05.744
"the amazing pillow
that stays cool."

19:05.812 --> 19:08.280
Who sleeps like a baby
on a hot summer's night?

19:10.617 --> 19:12.585
Cheers.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.521
CALLEN: And drink up.
It's showtime.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.426
- Come in.
- Thank you.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.597
(feet pattering on floor)

19:24.665 --> 19:26.700
Uh... come on!

19:26.767 --> 19:28.702
Whoa! Careful, boys.

19:28.770 --> 19:30.571
No running in the house.

19:30.638 --> 19:33.440
I see you've met my two little
monsters-- Mark and Ed.

19:33.508 --> 19:35.509
Horrible manners;
they take after my ex.

19:35.577 --> 19:36.510
(chuckles)

19:36.578 --> 19:37.845
Boys, come back
in here.

19:37.913 --> 19:39.848
Please?

19:39.915 --> 19:41.816
Say hello to Ms. Lange.

19:41.884 --> 19:42.818
Hi.

19:42.886 --> 19:43.819
Bye!

19:43.887 --> 19:44.987
(Hetty laughs)

19:45.054 --> 19:47.323
The ex has custody;
I get them once a month.

19:47.390 --> 19:50.325
You know, they make three tours
of duty look like a cakewalk,

19:50.393 --> 19:51.526
but I miss them like hell
when they're not here.

19:51.594 --> 19:52.627
I'm sure.

19:52.695 --> 19:54.796
Henrietta, you look great.

19:54.864 --> 19:56.164
Oh.

19:56.232 --> 19:57.299
BOTH:
Mmm...

19:57.366 --> 19:58.600
HETTY:
Thanks.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.801
Ah, that was a great view
of Basser's belt buckle.

19:59.868 --> 20:03.270
If Hetty would only...
Tippy, tippy-toes?

20:03.338 --> 20:04.271
Yeah.

20:04.339 --> 20:05.672
Got it covered, guys.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.542
I installed an adjustable camera
lens in the old Hetty-cam.

20:08.610 --> 20:09.743
That's better.

20:09.811 --> 20:12.013
How long has it been--
20 years?

20:12.081 --> 20:13.447
HETTY:
Oh, longer.

20:13.515 --> 20:16.684
Islamabad was '87.

20:16.751 --> 20:18.519
I remember that night
like it was yesterday.

20:18.586 --> 20:19.753
HETTY:
So do I.

20:19.821 --> 20:21.222
You saved my life.

20:21.290 --> 20:22.991
BASSER: Nothing you wouldn't
have done for me.

20:23.058 --> 20:23.992
Come on in.

20:24.060 --> 20:28.163
Yeah, we had
some wild times.

20:28.231 --> 20:29.531
Indeed, we did.

20:29.599 --> 20:31.700
Do you remember that
hand-off in Berlin?

20:31.768 --> 20:32.801
Oh.

20:32.869 --> 20:34.836
And the dinner with
the Saudi prince?

20:34.904 --> 20:36.205
(chuckling):
Yeah.

20:36.272 --> 20:37.840
Moscow?

20:37.907 --> 20:39.575
Don't remind me.

20:39.642 --> 20:43.045
I still shiver when I think back
on those cold winter nights.

20:43.112 --> 20:45.714
Did you ever get
the scotch I sent you?

20:45.782 --> 20:48.350
I feel guilty
just looking at it.

20:48.417 --> 20:49.984
It's no good to Saddam now.

20:50.052 --> 20:52.854
Well, I'm saving it
for a special occasion.

20:52.922 --> 20:54.689
Classic Hetty.

20:54.757 --> 20:56.858
You always had such restraint.

20:56.926 --> 20:59.495
BASSER: Cheers.
- Is it just me or are they flirting?

20:59.562 --> 21:01.897
(glasses clinking)
Nope. Just you.

21:01.965 --> 21:03.632
Really?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.968
Nah.

21:06.036 --> 21:08.804
Oh, come on. Th-The long
winter's nights and the,

21:08.872 --> 21:11.473
and th-the scotch
drinking?

21:11.541 --> 21:12.942
Okay.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.544
You know what, don't worry
if you can't see it.

21:15.612 --> 21:17.413
It's more of a master's class
anyway.

21:17.481 --> 21:18.414
(phone ringing)

21:18.482 --> 21:19.782
Yeah, Eric.

21:19.850 --> 21:21.617
I've accessed all of Basser's
security cams.

21:21.685 --> 21:23.386
We've got every inch
of that house covered.

21:23.453 --> 21:25.054
You and Sam are good to go.

21:25.122 --> 21:26.055
Floor plan?

21:26.123 --> 21:27.056
Sending it to you now.

21:27.124 --> 21:28.057
Basser's office is upstairs.

21:28.125 --> 21:30.226
Master bedroom downstairs.

21:30.293 --> 21:31.860
First door on the left.

21:31.928 --> 21:33.229
Let's do it.

21:33.297 --> 21:34.764
Let's roll.

21:36.032 --> 21:37.934
What's your connection

21:38.002 --> 21:41.271
to Stephanie Walters
and Dr. Calista Colby?

21:41.338 --> 21:42.906
They were two of
my operatives.

21:42.973 --> 21:46.109
Stephanie was one of my
most skilled negotiators.

21:46.176 --> 21:48.278
She brokered
numerous ceasefires

21:48.345 --> 21:51.348
between local tribal leaders
in southern Afghanistan.

21:51.415 --> 21:52.982
And Dr. Colby?

21:53.050 --> 21:55.051
She was advising
the engineering companies

21:55.119 --> 21:56.720
working on the country's
infrastructure,

21:56.787 --> 21:58.488
namely the building
of the highway

21:58.556 --> 21:59.890
connecting Gardez with Khost.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.494
You look skeptical.

22:03.561 --> 22:04.962
Contact the CIA.

22:05.029 --> 22:07.164
I was making
regular progress reports.

22:07.232 --> 22:09.967
I'll talk to Langley,
see if the files exist.

22:19.210 --> 22:21.412
(whispers): I'll search
for the files in his bedroom.

22:36.461 --> 22:38.963
Could use a little help here
with a password, Eric.

22:39.031 --> 22:40.598
All right, give me a sec.

22:42.601 --> 22:44.969
HETTY:
How did you meet Stephanie?

22:45.036 --> 22:47.304
BASSER:
Through a friend in Norfolk.

22:47.372 --> 22:51.040
I wish I had more information
for you, but, uh...

22:51.108 --> 22:52.708
this is all I know.

22:52.776 --> 22:54.310
Trouble.

22:54.378 --> 22:55.378
Sam, you got
a five-year-old bogey

22:55.446 --> 22:56.479
down the hall to your left.

22:56.546 --> 22:57.479
Which way do I go?

22:57.547 --> 22:58.647
Uh, he's coming right at you.

22:58.715 --> 22:59.948
Just duck in where you can.

23:06.421 --> 23:08.255
What-What the...?

23:08.323 --> 23:10.090
What are you doing
in my playroom?

23:10.158 --> 23:11.491
(sighs)

23:11.559 --> 23:13.060
Fixing the lights.

23:13.127 --> 23:15.996
I'm supposed to scream
if strangers talk to me.

23:16.064 --> 23:17.865
What's your name?

23:17.933 --> 23:19.033
Mark.

23:19.101 --> 23:20.334
My name is Sam.

23:20.402 --> 23:21.702
Now we're not
strangers.

23:21.770 --> 23:23.371
Then what are you doing here?

23:27.608 --> 23:29.609
Want to see
a cool trick?

23:29.677 --> 23:31.411
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- You do?

23:31.479 --> 23:32.679
Let's see.

23:32.747 --> 23:33.913
I'll show you something.

23:33.981 --> 23:35.849
Got a really cool trick for you.

23:35.916 --> 23:37.951
All right, here,
hold the deck.

23:38.019 --> 23:39.119
Hold the deck.

23:39.186 --> 23:40.953
Okay, so I take
this card, right?

23:41.021 --> 23:42.021
This four of hearts.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.556
- See it?
- Yeah.

23:43.624 --> 23:46.225
Okay, so I take that little
four of hearts, boom.

23:46.293 --> 23:47.960
It becomes a queen.

23:48.028 --> 23:49.395
That's pretty cool, huh?

23:49.463 --> 23:51.631
HETTY:
Do you know

23:51.699 --> 23:54.735
this man?

23:54.802 --> 23:56.938
No, I don't know him.

23:57.005 --> 23:58.473
Look, I have no idea

23:58.540 --> 24:00.575
who would want
Stephanie and Dr. Colby dead.

24:00.643 --> 24:03.778
I do know that there were a
number of radical Muslim groups

24:03.846 --> 24:05.614
with ties to the
Taliban in the region.

24:05.682 --> 24:07.616
And that they don't like
American interference,

24:07.683 --> 24:10.085
and they don't like women,
and they especially don't like

24:10.153 --> 24:12.120
the inroads we're making
through cease-fires.

24:12.188 --> 24:14.490
Even so, it seems
a long way to come

24:14.558 --> 24:16.692
to hunt down these two women.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.995
Hard to believe
the Taliban has the resources.

24:20.062 --> 24:22.764
These networks are
growing every day.

24:22.832 --> 24:25.233
Nothing surprises
me anymore.

24:25.301 --> 24:27.602
Almost done uploading, Houdini.

24:27.670 --> 24:29.137
Hang in there.

24:29.204 --> 24:32.107
Give me that ball
right there.

24:32.174 --> 24:33.174
Toss it.

24:33.242 --> 24:34.509
Toss me that.
All right.

24:34.577 --> 24:35.677
Okay, watching that?

24:35.745 --> 24:36.778
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

24:36.846 --> 24:37.846
'Cause I've heard that

24:37.914 --> 24:39.548
this ball likes to
just run and hide.

24:39.616 --> 24:40.582
Okay, come here, ball.

24:40.650 --> 24:41.750
Grab it.

24:41.818 --> 24:44.120
Look at that, look at
that, look at that,

24:44.187 --> 24:45.288
look at that...

24:45.356 --> 24:46.289
Whoa.
It's gone.

24:46.357 --> 24:47.924
Wait a minute, what's that?

24:47.992 --> 24:49.626
What's that?

24:49.693 --> 24:51.995
What was that doing
under that armpit?

24:52.062 --> 24:52.996
(both laugh)

24:53.063 --> 24:54.063
Isn't that amazing?

24:54.131 --> 24:55.331
How'd he do that?

24:55.399 --> 24:56.332
He's good.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.867
(computer beeps)

24:57.935 --> 24:59.436
All right,
you're free and clear, Callen.

24:59.503 --> 25:01.170
Got it.

25:01.238 --> 25:02.939
Watch this.

25:03.007 --> 25:04.307
Okay, ready?

25:04.375 --> 25:06.075
Ready? Okay.

25:07.578 --> 25:08.778
Nanny's on the move.

25:08.846 --> 25:10.713
Sam, you might want to take
the exit right behind you.

25:10.781 --> 25:12.681
I'm gonna go now, all right?

25:12.749 --> 25:13.849
- Bye.
- Shh.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.585
Bye, Sam.

25:22.759 --> 25:23.893
You knew the danger,

25:23.960 --> 25:27.196
but you sent Stephanie
and Dr. Colby in anyway.

25:27.264 --> 25:30.866
And you don't put your agents
in the line of fire daily?

25:30.934 --> 25:33.236
Stephanie and Calista
knew the risks.

25:33.303 --> 25:35.305
They believed in
what we were doing.

25:35.372 --> 25:38.007
Look, Hetty, I'm on your side.

25:38.075 --> 25:40.910
I'm using all my resources
to find out who killed them.

25:40.978 --> 25:42.846
My agents are my family.

25:42.914 --> 25:46.650
You of all people
should know that, Hetty.

25:46.718 --> 25:48.819
It's all here.

25:48.887 --> 25:50.688
Hundreds of reports
on Basser's network,

25:50.756 --> 25:52.056
all sent to the CIA.

25:52.124 --> 25:54.992
According to Nell, Langley
confirmed these were all logged.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.660
God, they're not just
about Afghanistan either.

25:56.728 --> 25:58.562
Some date back years.

25:58.630 --> 25:59.897
Maybe Basser was
telling the truth

25:59.964 --> 26:01.431
and he's providing
valuable intelligence.

26:01.499 --> 26:02.766
Maybe he's a good guy.

26:02.834 --> 26:04.601
ERIC:
Hey.

26:04.669 --> 26:07.571
I got ahold of security tapes
from Whitley University.

26:07.638 --> 26:11.075
A man entered Dr. Colby's office
after her last appointment.

26:11.142 --> 26:13.510
Meet Greg Reyes.

26:13.578 --> 26:16.213
He's a known associate of our
motorcycle rider Jose Agosto.

26:16.281 --> 26:19.116
They were both suspects
in a shooting two years ago,

26:19.184 --> 26:21.251
but there wasn't enough evidence
to charge them.

26:21.319 --> 26:22.519
We searched
Reyes's phone records.

26:22.586 --> 26:24.488
He received several calls
in the last two weeks

26:24.555 --> 26:26.089
from a Dennis White.

26:26.157 --> 26:29.826
Who is our mystery man
from Afghanistan.

26:29.894 --> 26:31.795
What do we know about him?

26:31.863 --> 26:33.797
He's an executive
at Talberton Oil.

26:33.865 --> 26:36.266
That's him in Kabul
with two of our murder victims,

26:36.334 --> 26:37.601
Stephanie Walters
and Calista Colby.

26:37.669 --> 26:39.870
He also placed
two calls to Reyes

26:39.938 --> 26:41.805
within an hour
of Stephanie's murder.

26:41.873 --> 26:44.709
So what's the connection between
Stephanie Walters, Larry Basser

26:44.776 --> 26:46.744
and tribal leaders
in Afghanistan?

26:46.812 --> 26:49.013
And how does
an oil company fit in?

26:49.081 --> 26:50.581
DEEKS: Unless we've
got this backwards,

26:50.649 --> 26:53.952
maybe it's not about brokering
peace deals between warlords,

26:54.020 --> 26:56.021
maybe it's all about oil.

27:11.351 --> 27:12.285
CALLEN:
Dennis White?

27:12.352 --> 27:13.653
Yeah.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.288
NCIS.

27:15.356 --> 27:18.324
You know a Stephanie Walters
or a Dr. Calista Colby?

27:18.392 --> 27:19.558
Never heard of them.

27:19.626 --> 27:21.126
- Careful, honey.
- Yeah.

27:21.194 --> 27:22.795
Ring a bell?

27:22.862 --> 27:24.797
I meet a lot
of people for work.

27:24.865 --> 27:27.833
I don't even know
where that was taken.

27:27.901 --> 27:31.304
Well, we'd ask them,
but they're both dead.

27:33.774 --> 27:37.644
So, Eric got access to
Cliff Bosworth's cloud drive.

27:37.711 --> 27:40.380
Turns out, Stephanie uploaded
dozens of documents--

27:40.448 --> 27:42.316
maps, satellite images,

27:42.383 --> 27:44.485
geophysical surveys
written by Dr. Colby,

27:44.552 --> 27:48.356
and a purchase agreement
for a parcel 100 miles from

27:48.457 --> 27:50.658
the pipeline being built
by Talberton Oil.

27:50.726 --> 27:52.894
Well, that's nothing too
out of the ordinary for somebody

27:52.962 --> 27:55.730
that's gathering intelligence
and facilitating cease-fires.

27:55.798 --> 27:57.165
Why go to the trouble
of uploading this

27:57.232 --> 27:58.332
to a personal cloud drive?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
Because Stephanie
didn't want anyone else

27:59.468 --> 28:00.501
to have access, for some reason.

28:00.569 --> 28:02.702
Maybe Stephanie
and Dr. Colby uncovered

28:02.770 --> 28:04.137
something they shouldn't have,

28:04.205 --> 28:07.040
like a shady handshake deal
or a secret pipeline.

28:07.108 --> 28:09.376
And Stephanie uploaded the proof
to her cloud drive.

28:09.444 --> 28:12.713
Nell, do we know who purchased
the land in that deal?

28:12.780 --> 28:15.348
Uh, we don't,
but I'll look into it.

28:15.416 --> 28:17.750
Guys, guys, I'm just
getting something.

28:17.818 --> 28:18.952
Okay, the shooter,
Greg Reyes,

28:19.019 --> 28:20.720
popped up on
a security camera at LAX.

28:20.788 --> 28:22.155
He was heading into

28:22.222 --> 28:24.190
the parking garage
three hours ago.

28:24.258 --> 28:25.591
All right, let's search
all flight manifests

28:25.659 --> 28:27.594
around that time, figure out
where this guy was going.

28:27.661 --> 28:30.229
Actually, he never even
got on a plane.

28:30.297 --> 28:32.931
Cameras caught him
leaving 45 minutes later.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.132
Eric, zoom in.

28:35.902 --> 28:37.068
He was picking someone up.

28:37.136 --> 28:37.902
Whoa.

28:37.970 --> 28:39.737
That's Casey Freed.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.906
He's another one of
Basser's operatives.

28:41.974 --> 28:44.241
Stephanie mentioned him
in one of her reports.

28:44.308 --> 28:46.476
They met a week ago
in Afghanistan.

28:46.544 --> 28:49.345
Uh, just flew in from Kabul,
cleared customs at LAX.

28:49.413 --> 28:52.515
Swiped his credit card
at The Sunset House.

28:52.583 --> 28:54.450
That's a private
members-only club.

28:54.518 --> 28:57.087
There's a five-year waitlist
just to get on the waitlist.

28:57.154 --> 28:58.455
Shall we?

28:58.523 --> 29:00.191
I think we shall.

29:05.631 --> 29:08.700
How come I always have to be
the straight-laced-- thanks--

29:08.768 --> 29:10.535
boring one
and you get to be the...

29:10.603 --> 29:11.770
The handsome
and witty one?

29:11.838 --> 29:13.138
'Cause that kind of
just comes naturally.

29:13.206 --> 29:14.540
No cover is gonna
conceal that.

29:14.607 --> 29:15.941
(laughs)

29:16.008 --> 29:20.378
I say that I am a stylist
from Paris flying through L.A.

29:20.446 --> 29:22.880
for an awards show,
and you get to be my intern.

29:22.947 --> 29:24.214
Your intern?
Are you serious?

29:24.282 --> 29:25.616
'Cause I could
be your model.

29:25.684 --> 29:27.484
Or we could just
ask Casey Freed

29:27.552 --> 29:29.886
why he was picked up
at LAX by a hit man.

29:29.954 --> 29:32.055
If he's working with Basser,
he's not gonna talk.

29:32.122 --> 29:33.623
He's gonna stall until
the deal goes through.

29:33.690 --> 29:36.892
All right, so we're just
gonna agree to disagree then?

29:36.960 --> 29:37.893
Yep.

29:37.961 --> 29:39.262
So, stalemate.

29:39.330 --> 29:40.897
Uh, more like
a standoff.

29:40.965 --> 29:42.332
So what are we doing
about cover?

29:42.400 --> 29:45.168
(chuckles): Well, like I said,
it's a standoff.

29:45.235 --> 29:46.969
So...

29:47.037 --> 29:48.004
Snooze, you lose!

29:48.072 --> 29:49.706
- What?
- See you up there.

29:49.773 --> 29:50.873
Deeks, wait. I...

29:53.176 --> 29:54.443
I have no idea
what happened.

29:54.511 --> 29:56.779
I didn't know they were dead
until you told me.

29:56.847 --> 29:58.448
What's your connection
with Greg Reyes?

29:59.984 --> 30:01.217
He's private security.

30:01.285 --> 30:03.019
He travels with me
to Afghanistan.

30:03.087 --> 30:04.187
SAM:
You spoke to Reyes

30:04.255 --> 30:06.256
twice last night. Why?

30:06.324 --> 30:07.291
I leave for Kabul tomorrow.

30:07.358 --> 30:08.759
We needed to discuss
my itinerary.

30:08.827 --> 30:11.195
And your connection
with Larry Basser?

30:11.263 --> 30:12.930
(sighs)

30:12.998 --> 30:15.099
He's the one
who introduced me to Reyes.

30:15.167 --> 30:16.801
Basser is a consultant
for my company.

30:16.868 --> 30:18.102
As part of his contract,

30:18.170 --> 30:21.439
he provides executive security
when we travel.

30:21.506 --> 30:23.174
What other services
does Basser provide?

30:23.242 --> 30:26.177
We hired him for his contacts
in Afghanistan--

30:26.245 --> 30:27.512
people on the ground

30:27.580 --> 30:30.982
who have connections
to local tribal leaders.

30:31.049 --> 30:33.951
We're constructing
a major oil pipeline

30:34.019 --> 30:36.454
that runs through an area
controlled by a local tribe.

30:36.521 --> 30:37.822
And you were facing opposition.

30:37.890 --> 30:39.891
The tribal leader's
against it.

30:39.959 --> 30:41.793
So you needed Basser
to negotiate with him.

30:41.861 --> 30:44.063
Yeah.

30:44.130 --> 30:46.031
What was your interaction
with Stephanie?

30:46.099 --> 30:48.868
Well, we met for the first time
about five days ago.

30:48.936 --> 30:51.304
But I'd call it more
a confrontation than a meeting.

30:51.372 --> 30:55.308
She had just discovered that
Basser was using her connections

30:55.376 --> 30:58.077
to help my company
secure the oil pipeline.

30:58.145 --> 30:59.211
She thought she was there

30:59.279 --> 31:00.713
to broker peace deals
for the military.

31:01.981 --> 31:03.582
Stephanie left the meeting
very angry.

31:03.649 --> 31:04.916
Did she speak
with Basser

31:04.984 --> 31:06.684
after she found out?
I don't know.

31:06.752 --> 31:08.219
I never saw her again.

31:08.286 --> 31:09.553
And Larry said he'd handle it.

31:09.621 --> 31:11.521
Handle what exactly?

31:11.589 --> 31:13.090
The tribal leader.

31:14.425 --> 31:15.592
And when was he gonna do that?

31:15.660 --> 31:17.060
Today.

31:25.938 --> 31:27.505
Oh.

31:27.573 --> 31:29.007
(British accent):
Don't be so glum, sweetheart.

31:29.074 --> 31:30.875
Come meet Melissa Peters.
She manages the club.

31:30.943 --> 31:32.009
Nice to meet you, Ines.

31:32.077 --> 31:34.746
I am so sorry...

31:34.814 --> 31:37.248
about your situation.

31:37.316 --> 31:39.350
DEEKS:
Oh, don't be shy.

31:39.418 --> 31:41.118
It's all over the tabloids.
The whole world knows that

31:41.186 --> 31:43.387
that love-rat footballer
dumped you at the altar.

31:43.455 --> 31:44.388
600 guests

31:44.456 --> 31:45.789
at Blenheim Palace.

31:45.857 --> 31:47.724
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge,
uh, Sir Elton, Dame Edna.

31:47.792 --> 31:49.025
I mean, this is

31:49.093 --> 31:51.194
probably the worst thing you can
do to a woman, am I right?

31:51.261 --> 31:52.361
(sighs)

31:52.429 --> 31:53.796
I just went through
a bad breakup myself.

31:53.864 --> 31:54.864
You did?

31:54.932 --> 31:56.232
It'll take time, Ines.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.701
Takes time.
Bikram yoga

31:57.769 --> 31:59.436
and burning his photos
will help.

31:59.504 --> 32:00.637
Oh.

32:00.705 --> 32:02.373
I was just saying
to Melissa that we managed

32:02.441 --> 32:03.908
to avoid the paparazzi
on Sunset.

32:03.976 --> 32:05.143
Somehow, they caught wind

32:05.211 --> 32:07.446
that Brazil's most famous
topless model

32:07.513 --> 32:10.416
escaped to L.A.
after her doomed wedding.

32:10.484 --> 32:11.951
We just want to
have a quiet bite.

32:12.019 --> 32:14.988
I thought that, um, our club in
London had arranged everything.

32:19.660 --> 32:21.428
Normally, we don't have
reciprocal privileges,

32:21.495 --> 32:22.796
even with the Molton House

32:22.864 --> 32:25.131
in London,

32:25.199 --> 32:26.833
but I'll make an exception.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.901
(laughs)

32:28.969 --> 32:30.236
Go ahead that way.

32:30.304 --> 32:32.305
You'll find the pool,
a restaurant and two bars.

32:32.373 --> 32:33.840
You're an angel.

32:33.907 --> 32:35.141
You are. I'm in
love with you.

32:35.209 --> 32:36.142
I am.

32:36.210 --> 32:37.310
Positively
in love with you.

32:37.378 --> 32:39.279
(laughs)

32:39.347 --> 32:40.847
That was your English accent?

32:40.915 --> 32:43.251
Yeah, but it kept slipping
between Captain Jack Sparrow

32:43.318 --> 32:44.919
and Mary Poppins.
Mm-hmm.

32:44.987 --> 32:46.521
And topless model?

32:46.589 --> 32:48.156
What are you talking about?
That's a compliment.

32:48.224 --> 32:49.524
Have you seen those
Brazilian magazines?

32:49.592 --> 32:50.959
They have high standards there.
(chuckles)

32:51.027 --> 32:52.361
And isn't Ines the name of

32:52.429 --> 32:53.762
that burlesque dancer/
professional mud wrestler

32:53.830 --> 32:54.864
that you were seeing?

32:54.931 --> 32:56.065
Again, a compliment.

32:56.132 --> 32:57.700
She's both
graceful and athletic.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.468
Okay. Oh, heads up.

32:59.536 --> 33:01.137
There's Freed, and
he's on his laptop.

33:01.204 --> 33:03.706
Just who we need.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.307
Do your thing, Ines.

33:05.375 --> 33:06.641
Wow.

33:06.709 --> 33:08.877
- That just happened.
- Good?

33:08.945 --> 33:09.878
- Yeah.
- Good?

33:09.946 --> 33:11.012
Definitely.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.014
Definitely... good.

33:13.082 --> 33:15.083
(indistinct chatter)

33:16.953 --> 33:18.953
(with Portuguese accent):
Is this seat taken?

33:20.757 --> 33:22.724
All yours.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.560
I'll have what he's
having, please.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.862
Where are you from?

33:26.929 --> 33:31.667
I'm from a small town
outside of Rio.

33:31.734 --> 33:32.835
BARTENDER:
Here you go.

33:32.902 --> 33:33.836
KENSI:
Thank you.

33:33.903 --> 33:35.170
I've only been
here one week.

33:35.238 --> 33:36.739
How do you like it?

33:36.806 --> 33:39.808
It's wonderful except
the policy at the pool.

33:39.876 --> 33:42.011
I don't know why they
require a bathing suit

33:42.079 --> 33:43.846
when we are swimming
here, you know?

33:43.914 --> 33:45.848
(giggling):
It's so silly.

33:45.916 --> 33:48.517
Mmm.

33:48.585 --> 33:49.852
Is that Beverly Hills?

33:49.920 --> 33:52.074
Um, over there by the ocean,

33:52.075 --> 33:53.349
and, uh, that's
the Hollywood Hills.

33:53.374 --> 33:54.574
(gasps)

33:54.891 --> 33:58.561
Oh, I always wanted to see the
Hollywood sign when I was a kid.

33:58.628 --> 34:01.864
Mm... hmm. Anyway, <i>saúde.</i>

34:03.466 --> 34:05.100
So where are you from?

34:05.168 --> 34:08.503
Anything come up
on Freed's hard drive?

34:08.571 --> 34:10.138
Yeah, a potential goldmine.

34:10.206 --> 34:11.906
He's another one
of Basser's operatives.

34:11.974 --> 34:13.908
We found the usual
intelligence reports,

34:13.976 --> 34:15.710
but there is one odd thing--

34:15.777 --> 34:18.179
Basser sent the tribal leader
classified information

34:18.246 --> 34:19.581
on Talberton's pipeline.

34:19.649 --> 34:22.417
I thought Basser was working
with the oil company.

34:22.485 --> 34:24.052
That can only mean one thing.

34:24.120 --> 34:27.188
Basser's going to use the tribal
leader to attack the pipeline.

34:27.255 --> 34:29.024
(alarm beeps)
Oh, boy.

34:29.092 --> 34:31.360
Someone is trying to access
Basser's encrypted site

34:31.428 --> 34:32.895
using Stephanie's log-in name.

34:32.963 --> 34:34.228
You got an IP address?

34:34.297 --> 34:35.697
(typing)

34:35.764 --> 34:37.132
Yeah.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.934
Cliff and Stephanie's house.

34:39.002 --> 34:41.136
You think
Cliff's hiding something?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.904
Let's find out.

35:11.969 --> 35:13.970
MAN:
Come on, let's go! Let's go! Go!

35:17.241 --> 35:18.174
Let's go! Go!

35:18.242 --> 35:19.442
Freeze!
Federal agents!

35:19.509 --> 35:21.310
(gunfire)

35:21.378 --> 35:22.978
(panicked screaming)

35:25.315 --> 35:26.315
(groans)

35:31.320 --> 35:33.421
SAM:
Get out of the way!

35:33.489 --> 35:35.022
Out of the way!

35:35.090 --> 35:37.058
(tires screeching)
Go, go! Come on!

35:49.580 --> 35:51.514
Any luck tracking Reyes's SUV?

35:51.582 --> 35:53.516
- Working on it.
- What about Basser?

35:53.584 --> 35:56.285
Well, they hit paydirt
on Stephanie's cloud drive.

35:56.353 --> 35:57.853
Turns out the land
a hundred miles

35:57.921 --> 36:00.823
west of the Talberton pipeline

36:00.891 --> 36:03.092
is owned by one of Larry
Basser's shell corporations.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.761
DEEKS: So Basser helps
the local tribal leader

36:04.828 --> 36:06.262
blow up Talberton's pipeline.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.865
and suddenly Talberton
is looking for a safer route.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.458
So Basser is driving business
to the land he already owns.

36:11.483 --> 36:12.068
Mm-hmm.

36:12.069 --> 36:14.404
Why would a decorated soldier
and career NSA agent

36:14.471 --> 36:15.572
betray his country?

36:15.639 --> 36:19.242
Larry saw his best friend
die in Fallujah.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.579
The NSA turned its back on him.

36:22.646 --> 36:24.914
They made him the scapegoat.

36:24.982 --> 36:26.683
He was never the same.

36:26.750 --> 36:28.651
He lost his wife,

36:28.719 --> 36:31.554
his career,
his reputation...

36:31.622 --> 36:34.957
After that day,
I think a part of him decided

36:35.025 --> 36:38.661
he would only be loyal
to himself.

36:39.997 --> 36:44.501
Nell, how much time before
they attack that pipeline?

36:44.569 --> 36:47.537
According to Stephanie's
intel, less than two hours.

36:47.605 --> 36:48.672
I'll inform SecNav.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.007
Perhaps we can cut off

36:51.075 --> 36:54.277
the militants before
they get to the pipeline.

36:54.345 --> 36:57.681
Hey, I just retrieved an e-mail
Cliff Bosworth got an hour ago.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.649
From Stephanie...?!

36:59.717 --> 37:02.352
She sent it from the Internet
café before she died,

37:02.419 --> 37:04.053
but scheduled delivery
for today.

37:04.121 --> 37:07.090
KENSI: "Cliff, I'm giving myself
48 hours to figure things out,

37:07.158 --> 37:08.525
"but if anything happens to me,

37:08.593 --> 37:11.461
"give this log-in name
and password

37:11.529 --> 37:13.931
"to my old boss at the Navy,
David Forbes.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.599
"He'll know what to do.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.767
I love you. Stephanie."

37:16.835 --> 37:18.335
That was her fail-safe.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.803
I checked Cliff's
cell phone records--

37:19.871 --> 37:21.639
he made a call
to Commander Forbes,

37:21.706 --> 37:23.074
which was never picked up.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.808
So he started digging around
on Basser's site himself.

37:24.876 --> 37:27.244
DEEKS: Basser wouldn't
risk kidnapping Cliff,

37:27.312 --> 37:28.979
unless he thought
he knew something.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.315
Like where Stephanie hid
the evidence against him.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.617
(computer beeps)
ERIC: Guys, I got Basser's guy Reyes.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.319
He's three miles out at sea.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.722
ERIC: Just logged on
to Basser's network.

37:37.789 --> 37:40.591
Sam, we're gonna
need a boat.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.463
(punch thuds, man grunts)

37:47.166 --> 37:48.733
(groans)

37:48.801 --> 37:50.335
(coughing)

37:50.402 --> 37:53.905
Either he doesn't know anything,
or he's tougher than he looks.

37:53.973 --> 37:55.106
Go to hell.

37:55.174 --> 37:56.341
Yeah, you first.

37:56.409 --> 37:57.742
(boat horn blows)

37:57.810 --> 37:59.110
Please help!

37:59.178 --> 38:00.111
(boat horn blowing)

38:00.179 --> 38:02.714
Take over.

38:05.084 --> 38:06.684
KENSI: Hey!
DEEKS: Hey!

38:06.752 --> 38:09.621
KENSI: Hello!
Over here!

38:09.688 --> 38:10.955
Stay there.

38:11.023 --> 38:12.457
KENSI: Hello!
DEEKS: Hey!

38:12.524 --> 38:13.591
Hey!

38:13.659 --> 38:14.892
Hey!

38:14.959 --> 38:16.227
Help us!

38:18.496 --> 38:19.930
Excuse me, sir!

38:19.998 --> 38:21.131
Please help us!

38:21.199 --> 38:22.666
There's a fire on board.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.167
We don't have a radio.

38:24.235 --> 38:26.169
Can you please help us?
DEEKS: Hey!

38:26.237 --> 38:28.237
KENSI:
We need help!

38:29.239 --> 38:31.307
Federal agent!

38:31.842 --> 38:33.342
(yells)

38:34.077 --> 38:35.078
(groans)

38:37.347 --> 38:38.882
KENSI: Federal agents!
Freeze!

38:41.853 --> 38:43.187
Drop your weapon!

38:43.254 --> 38:45.256
Drop it!

38:48.594 --> 38:49.760
On your knees!

38:50.896 --> 38:52.596
Get down!

38:52.664 --> 38:54.364
You okay?

38:54.432 --> 38:55.432
Yeah, man.

38:59.203 --> 39:02.305
That's quite a swing set.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.474
Yeah, the, uh, the boys
just left.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.376
They went back up north
with their mom.

39:06.444 --> 39:09.545
I promised I'd have it finished
when they got back.

39:09.613 --> 39:12.781
If she ever lets them
come back.

39:12.849 --> 39:16.351
I'm sorry you're not going
to be able to finish it.

39:18.654 --> 39:20.588
How much do you know?

39:20.655 --> 39:23.223
Everything.

39:30.732 --> 39:33.100
Thinking of shooting me, Larry?

39:33.168 --> 39:36.738
Yeah, the thought
crossed my mind.

39:39.575 --> 39:41.544
Why did you come?

39:41.611 --> 39:44.681
You saved my life once.

39:44.748 --> 39:48.551
Loyalty is important to me, too.

39:48.619 --> 39:53.056
They're going to be here
in about five minutes,

39:53.123 --> 39:56.927
and then my hands are tied.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.638
Five minutes.

40:07.706 --> 40:11.743
Not long in a lifetime.

40:11.811 --> 40:17.282
No, it's not, at all.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.603
(gunshot)

40:48.514 --> 40:51.817
I got here too late.

40:59.993 --> 41:03.696
Okay. Oh, what are we...
Heading out already?

41:03.763 --> 41:05.130
You don't, you don't want
to grab a beer?

41:05.198 --> 41:06.665
Hmm-mm.
No? Maybe some
Chinese food?

41:06.732 --> 41:09.000
Or Italian? Come on, man,
I know you love Italian.

41:09.068 --> 41:11.336
Or you and I could do
some on-line shopping.

41:11.403 --> 41:13.003
You want to buy some shoes?

41:13.071 --> 41:14.605
Maybe some cutlery?

41:14.673 --> 41:16.607
You got nowhere to go, do you?

41:16.674 --> 41:17.874
No, that's not true.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.643
I just love spending
time with you guys.

41:19.711 --> 41:20.644
Is that such a crime?

41:20.711 --> 41:22.679
(zipping up bag)

41:22.747 --> 41:24.681
Okay, fair enough.
Fumigation company called.

41:24.749 --> 41:27.550
They said I can't get back into
my place until after midnight.

41:27.618 --> 41:28.585
Sorry, buddy.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.020
I got plans.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.688
Oh.
Diving trip in Cancún.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.090
Got a flight to catch.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.258
(snaps fingers)

41:34.326 --> 41:35.359
Can... Cancún?

41:35.427 --> 41:36.694
KENSI:
Hey.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.629
I don't mind a burger
and a beer.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.198
Yeah?

41:40.266 --> 41:41.533
Yeah.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.634
If you pay.

41:42.702 --> 41:44.469
Done.

41:44.537 --> 41:47.005
And drive.

41:47.073 --> 41:49.374
Done.

41:49.442 --> 41:52.710
And do my laundry for a month.

41:52.778 --> 41:56.247
Laundry?

41:56.314 --> 41:58.849
Outerwear only, Deeks.

41:58.917 --> 41:59.850
Okay?

41:59.917 --> 42:00.951
Uh-huh.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.620
(snickering)

42:03.688 --> 42:05.622
Hold up.

42:05.689 --> 42:09.525
I'm driving, buying,
washing your underwear.

42:14.499 --> 42:15.999
(breathes deeply)

42:17.068 --> 42:19.536
From Basser?

42:19.604 --> 42:20.871
Indeed.

42:20.939 --> 42:25.210
Liberated from Saddam
Hussein's personal cellar.

42:27.313 --> 42:28.914
Care to join me?

42:28.981 --> 42:30.815
I thought you'd never ask.

42:41.693 --> 42:44.128
To old friends.

42:44.196 --> 42:48.132

42:50.469 --> 42:51.669
(stifled gag)

42:52.142 --> 42:54.457
HETTY:
<i>Oh! This tastes like crap.</i>
