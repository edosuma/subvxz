00:14.377 --> 00:17.046
Not content with
an atlas of Patagonia,

00:17.048 --> 00:20.649
he then proceeded to devour
a first edition <i>Gatsby.</i>

00:20.651 --> 00:22.817
You want him to stop
eating your books,

00:22.819 --> 00:26.454
stop buying 'em
leather-bound.

00:26.456 --> 00:27.622
I'll buy you a new one.

00:27.624 --> 00:29.290
I don't believe
I pay you enough

00:29.292 --> 00:30.792
to replace it, Mr. Reese,
and you're missing the point.

00:30.794 --> 00:33.494
Some things simply
cannot be replaced.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.165
Coffee.

00:38.167 --> 00:39.900
Finch, they didn't have
your Sencha thing,

00:39.902 --> 00:41.301
so I got you Mint Medley.

00:41.303 --> 00:42.936
Oh, I'll go without then,
thank you.

00:42.938 --> 00:47.241
Hydrating on a stakeout
is a double-edged sword anyway.

00:47.243 --> 00:49.309
You forget
your water bottle, Finch?

00:54.015 --> 00:55.315
Okay, here he is.

00:55.317 --> 00:57.784
Evening, Benny.

00:57.786 --> 00:59.586
Why are we watching him again?

00:59.588 --> 01:01.788
We have credible
information that Mr. Belasco

01:01.790 --> 01:03.590
has run afoul of HR.

01:03.592 --> 01:06.793
A member of that organization
may try to kill him,

01:06.795 --> 01:08.828
or he may try to kill
one of them, I suppose,

01:08.830 --> 01:10.630
but it seems unlikely.

01:10.632 --> 01:12.799
Credible information, huh?

01:12.801 --> 01:15.835
I trust that the two of you
have this covered.

01:15.837 --> 01:17.370
Yeah, we just got to wait here

01:17.372 --> 01:19.539
to see which dirty cop
shows up to kill Benny.

01:19.541 --> 01:21.207
Then we'll save his life.

01:21.209 --> 01:23.342
You make our work
sound so simple.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.444
It must be.
You're leaving us.

01:25.446 --> 01:26.645
You brought home a beast.

01:26.647 --> 01:28.680
I have to walk it and water it

01:28.682 --> 01:33.119
and feed it, lest it consume
any more of my books.

01:33.421 --> 01:35.588
Mr. Reese.
Detective.

01:47.367 --> 01:48.399
Uh-uh, no.

01:48.401 --> 01:50.102
Come on, this is a classic.

01:50.104 --> 01:55.306
Classic rock puts me to sleep.

02:03.549 --> 02:06.951
Still trying
to get used to this.

02:06.953 --> 02:09.387
- Being early.
- Early?

02:09.389 --> 02:11.822
I'm Homicide, John.

02:11.824 --> 02:14.125
Usually if you're
spending time with me,

02:14.127 --> 02:17.795
it's because
you're already dead.

02:18.297 --> 02:19.730
Just look at him,

02:19.732 --> 02:21.732
just walking around.

02:21.734 --> 02:23.833
Don't even know
what's coming for him.

02:23.835 --> 02:26.002
He ought to,

02:26.004 --> 02:28.672
stealing from a bunch
of corrupt cops.

02:28.674 --> 02:33.442
Nah, I've seen a lot
of dead bodies.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.912
You know what they all
had in common?

02:35.914 --> 02:38.648
Not one of them looked like
they saw it coming.

02:48.292 --> 02:51.627
Hey, Wonder Boy.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.763
Time to pretend
to be a detective again.

02:53.765 --> 02:57.933
Two Brotherhood guys shot dead.

02:57.935 --> 02:59.835
I'm not answering
any questions.

02:59.837 --> 03:01.437
Elias's guy--
sole survivor.

03:01.439 --> 03:04.139
His name's Carlo.

03:04.141 --> 03:06.508
See what I can find out.

03:07.977 --> 03:10.045
Finch, I got two dead
Brotherhood guys

03:10.047 --> 03:12.147
whose numbers never came up.

03:12.149 --> 03:14.316
This some kind
of glitch in the Machine?

03:14.318 --> 03:15.684
I certainly hope not.

03:15.686 --> 03:17.319
Perhaps this is
a crime of opportunity.

03:17.321 --> 03:19.288
The Machine only
sees premeditation.

03:19.290 --> 03:20.789
Could be Elias
ordered the shooting

03:20.791 --> 03:22.490
in retaliation against Dominic

03:22.492 --> 03:24.158
for disappearing
three of his men.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.227
And we've just received
a new number

03:26.229 --> 03:29.831
unrelated to Dominic or Elias.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.300
Chase Patterson, 25,

03:32.302 --> 03:35.002
his family slain in 2008.

03:35.004 --> 03:37.038
Chase was a prime suspect
at the time.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.539
Was he ever convicted?

03:38.541 --> 03:41.642
No, before he could
be charged or arrested,

03:41.644 --> 03:44.212
Mr. Patterson
fled the country.

03:44.214 --> 03:45.913
He's just returned
to New York City

03:45.915 --> 03:47.815
after seven years in Paris.

03:47.817 --> 03:50.417
You and Fusco
stay on Dominic and Elias.

03:50.419 --> 03:52.720
I can handle
one murderer on my own.

03:52.722 --> 03:54.488
Alleged murderer.

03:54.490 --> 03:56.690
Maybe Chase's case
file can help clear that up.

03:56.692 --> 03:59.326
I'll go down to evidence
and take a look.

04:08.035 --> 04:09.703
Congratulations?

04:09.705 --> 04:13.406
Don't go buying me
that blender just yet, Harry.

04:13.408 --> 04:15.508
With Samaritan
hunting down the Machine,

04:15.510 --> 04:18.411
I figured we should start
our own search for her.

04:18.413 --> 04:20.079
I tried to get close to someone

04:20.082 --> 04:23.216
I thought
had inside information.

04:23.218 --> 04:25.185
It ended badly.

04:25.187 --> 04:27.887
Not only am I still
on the market,

04:27.889 --> 04:31.758
but we have no leads
to help us find her.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.394
Ms. Groves, how would you like
to try your hand

04:34.396 --> 04:35.561
at stopping a gang war?

04:35.563 --> 04:36.962
It would involve determining

04:36.964 --> 04:40.633
whether the Machine
is functioning properly.

04:40.635 --> 04:42.635
When do we start?

04:47.573 --> 04:48.974
Must be some kind of mistake.

04:48.976 --> 04:50.876
I just wanted
the Patterson case file.

04:50.878 --> 04:52.378
Wasn't in its proper place.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.546
Found it in the primary
detective's effects.

04:54.548 --> 04:55.948
Effects?

04:55.950 --> 04:57.482
Detective's things
are evidence now.

04:57.484 --> 05:00.218
Evidence?
Why?

05:00.220 --> 05:01.486
She was murdered.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.826
_

Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

05:21.765 --> 05:23.131
You're cold?

05:23.133 --> 05:27.102
Oh, no, I'm good.

05:27.104 --> 05:29.271
You know what's worse
than a stakeout?

05:29.273 --> 05:31.774
Going back to
the precinct at 5:00 AM

05:31.776 --> 05:34.777
doing three hours
of paperwork about a stakeout.

05:34.779 --> 05:36.477
There's no paperwork
when you're working

05:36.479 --> 05:39.281
with me and Finch.

05:39.283 --> 05:43.385
Good thing.
The stunts you pull...

05:45.955 --> 05:48.924
Military wasn't much better.

05:48.926 --> 05:51.726
Lots of red tape
to go around there too.

05:51.728 --> 05:54.094
Never cared much for red tape.

05:54.096 --> 05:57.097
My time wasn't
like yours, though.

05:57.099 --> 05:59.434
You were an officer.
I was a grunt.

05:59.436 --> 06:02.236
Wasn't really good at anything,

06:02.238 --> 06:04.439
not at first.

06:04.441 --> 06:07.642
But later, what
were you good at then?

06:07.644 --> 06:10.877
Taking orders.

06:10.879 --> 06:12.913
Got a little too good at that.

06:21.489 --> 06:24.458
You ever think
about the future,

06:24.460 --> 06:25.826
doing something else?

06:25.828 --> 06:27.360
Sure.

06:30.198 --> 06:33.967
Some days, I see so much death,

06:33.969 --> 06:36.670
I just think about
putting in my 20

06:36.672 --> 06:38.104
and getting out.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.639
Where would you go?

06:39.641 --> 06:41.841
A beach.

06:41.843 --> 06:45.011
Yeah, somewhere
where there's no blood.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.013
No showing up
on somebody's doorstep

06:47.015 --> 06:51.049
with news that you know
is gonna ruin their life.

06:51.051 --> 06:55.287
Just me and a whole
lot of sunshine.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.055
So what's stopping you?

06:57.057 --> 07:00.325
Two hours on the beach,
and I lose my mind.

07:00.327 --> 07:04.396
That, and I could never
take Taylor out of school.

07:04.398 --> 07:05.830
He's doing good, you know?

07:05.832 --> 07:11.636
He's making decent grades,
decent friends,

07:11.638 --> 07:16.041
and Taylor is very
proud of his mom.

07:16.043 --> 07:17.309
I'll bet he is.

08:05.076 --> 08:06.973
_

08:15.299 --> 08:17.700
Hey, partner,
what you working on?

08:17.702 --> 08:21.604
It's just a cold case.
Nothing urgent.

08:21.606 --> 08:23.440
Glasses and Cocoa Puffs
are gonna pay a visit

08:23.442 --> 08:25.375
to Elias' guy Carlo.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.777
Maybe I should stay here
and help with this case.

08:27.779 --> 08:30.580
You're not exactly
employee of the month.

08:30.582 --> 08:32.048
You saying I'm a bad cop?

08:32.049 --> 08:33.716
I'm saying you're
a terrible cop.

08:37.921 --> 08:39.554
Hey.

08:39.557 --> 08:41.090
Everything okay with you?

08:41.092 --> 08:44.993
Go help Finch.
I got things covered.

08:57.307 --> 08:58.707
Caught a big one.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.341
Home invasion, Park Avenue.

09:00.343 --> 09:02.143
Quadruple homicide.

09:02.145 --> 09:04.079
I'll show you how it's done.

09:04.081 --> 09:07.248
You're the rook.
You keep the file.

09:11.821 --> 09:13.154
Pattersons got a lot of dough,

09:13.156 --> 09:14.789
which means they
got a lot of lawyers too.

09:14.791 --> 09:15.790
You get what I'm saying?

09:15.792 --> 09:17.425
Yeah, we do this by the book.

09:17.427 --> 09:19.193
Exactly, and
I'll do all the talking.

09:20.962 --> 09:22.597
I'm sorry, sir,
but Mr. Patterson

09:22.599 --> 09:24.632
requested not to be disturbed.

09:24.634 --> 09:26.467
It's Detective.

09:26.469 --> 09:29.203
Need to take a quick look
around this place.

09:29.205 --> 09:32.773
Chase-- Mr. Patterson's been
staying in a different apartment

09:32.775 --> 09:34.274
in the building
since he got back,

09:34.276 --> 09:38.512
just until he sells
the penthouse where it happened.

09:38.514 --> 09:40.781
Tell you what, I'll call
the building manager,

09:40.783 --> 09:42.783
see if he can show you around.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.824
All right, so
we have four victims.

09:51.826 --> 09:54.394
Mom, dad,
two of their grown kids.

09:54.396 --> 09:57.130
I found them here
this morning tied up,

09:57.132 --> 09:59.999
throats slit.

10:00.001 --> 10:01.834
Do we buy this home invasion

10:01.836 --> 10:04.237
in a doorman building
on Park Avenue?

10:04.239 --> 10:06.505
Could be an inside job.

10:06.507 --> 10:09.175
You said two
of their grown kids.

10:09.177 --> 10:10.710
Is there another?

10:10.712 --> 10:13.680
Chase Patterson, 18, only son.

10:13.682 --> 10:15.481
Got kicked out
of bordering school last year

10:15.483 --> 10:18.417
because they found
drug paraphernalia in his dorm.

10:18.419 --> 10:20.219
He's the one who found them.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.831
You looking for something
specific, Detective?

10:35.435 --> 10:36.902
It's just a busy day.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.340
And you were
all present last night.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.542
We left after
dinner was served.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.745
And the youngest kid,
Chase, never showed.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.413
That's right.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.716
Did he get along
with his parents?

10:54.020 --> 10:56.087
There was friction there.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.924
So Chase
and his parents fought.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.859
Constantly.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.261
But you didn't hear anything

11:03.263 --> 11:04.429
the night of the murders?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.698
Nothing.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.101
You know what this is?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.369
You got me.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.937
Pure jade.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.940
Easy to carry, easy to pawn

11:15.942 --> 11:18.042
for a good 20 grand.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.377
So if Chase killed his family

11:20.379 --> 11:23.313
and stole their things
for drug money,

11:23.315 --> 11:26.483
why leave this behind?

11:26.485 --> 11:28.885
Why don't you ask him?

11:30.888 --> 11:32.822
What happened, Chase?

11:32.824 --> 11:35.158
I went out for the night.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.295
I didn't want to wake
anyone when I came home.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.430
What did you see?

11:40.432 --> 11:44.234
Tessa, then my other sister,

11:44.236 --> 11:47.070
and my parents
all tied up in a row.

11:47.072 --> 11:49.305
Someone had cut their throats.

11:53.110 --> 11:55.511
So why was your whole family
home that night?

11:55.513 --> 11:57.914
We had dinner there
every Sunday.

11:57.916 --> 12:01.251
Then where were you?

12:01.253 --> 12:03.919
Come on, Chase,
what aren't you telling me?

12:03.921 --> 12:05.354
Nothing.

12:05.356 --> 12:07.590
I've already told my side.

12:07.592 --> 12:10.993
So why are you hiding it now?

12:10.995 --> 12:13.763
I'm not hiding it.

12:13.765 --> 12:16.699
I told her.

12:16.701 --> 12:20.435
- Her?
- The detective.

12:20.437 --> 12:23.272
Carter, that was
her name, right?

12:23.274 --> 12:26.374
I gave her my alibi.

12:26.376 --> 12:29.978
Now, tell me, Chase,
where were you last night?

12:29.980 --> 12:32.714
At our cabin in the Catskills.

12:32.716 --> 12:34.016
Doing what?

12:38.220 --> 12:40.622
Relapsing.

12:44.293 --> 12:47.962
Before last night,
I had been clean for six months.

12:47.964 --> 12:52.366
Your parents believe that?

12:52.368 --> 12:54.501
After my last relapse,

12:54.503 --> 12:56.838
my mom found me unresponsive

12:56.840 --> 12:59.740
in my bedroom.

12:59.742 --> 13:02.743
She told me she held my hand

13:02.745 --> 13:05.746
all the way from home
to the hospital.

13:05.748 --> 13:09.850
Didn't let it go
until I woke up.

13:09.852 --> 13:12.586
That sounds
about right for a mom.

13:12.588 --> 13:15.222
I had to go to rehab.

13:15.224 --> 13:16.724
Every day,

13:16.726 --> 13:21.695
my mom would walk me
to meetings.

13:21.697 --> 13:27.600
I told her, "You're
treating me like a child."

13:27.602 --> 13:29.936
And what did she have
to say about that?

13:32.573 --> 13:37.010
That I was a child,

13:37.012 --> 13:38.945
her child.

13:41.114 --> 13:44.950
When I went home this morning,

13:44.952 --> 13:47.687
I was going to ask her
to forgive me,

13:47.689 --> 13:51.424
and then

13:51.426 --> 13:56.262
she was gone.

13:56.264 --> 13:58.730
They were all gone.

14:02.302 --> 14:03.769
Okay, Chase, you didn't do it.

14:03.771 --> 14:05.437
Who did?

14:09.075 --> 14:10.309
Tell me.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.348
Either charge me or release me.

14:19.985 --> 14:23.555
Some junkie kid kills his
entire family for drug money.

14:23.557 --> 14:24.923
Then he sneaks off to a cabin

14:24.925 --> 14:26.425
so no one can
corroborate his alibi.

14:26.427 --> 14:27.959
Come on, you said it yourself.

14:27.961 --> 14:29.327
When was the last time
you heard of a home invasion

14:29.329 --> 14:31.963
in a doorman building
on Park Avenue?

14:31.965 --> 14:34.232
Why don't you
want to arrest him?

14:34.234 --> 14:37.335
I looked into his eyes.

14:37.337 --> 14:39.137
He's damaged,

14:39.139 --> 14:40.972
but there is no way in hell

14:40.974 --> 14:42.840
he slit his mother's throat.

14:46.946 --> 14:49.313
Terney.

14:49.315 --> 14:52.450
Thank you.

14:52.452 --> 14:56.454
The murderer's DNA
came back a familial match.

14:58.824 --> 14:59.957
I'm going to the cabin,

14:59.959 --> 15:02.192
see if I can
corroborate his story.

15:09.600 --> 15:13.003
- Thank you, Carlo.
- Keep that psycho away from me.

15:13.005 --> 15:15.439
Hey, Harold, did you
talk with Elias' guy, Carlo?

15:15.441 --> 15:17.941
Ms. Groves just finished
questioning him.

15:17.943 --> 15:19.843
It appears that Carlo
went to the deli

15:19.845 --> 15:21.310
to cash in
a free sandwich coupon.

15:21.312 --> 15:22.712
While he was waiting for it,

15:22.714 --> 15:24.013
Dominic's men entered

15:24.015 --> 15:25.682
and headed
for the chips and dip.

15:25.684 --> 15:27.249
Should've had a picnic.

15:27.251 --> 15:30.186
It does appear that this
was a crime of opportunity,

15:30.188 --> 15:31.488
which means that the Machine

15:31.490 --> 15:33.690
is indeed functioning
as intended.

15:33.692 --> 15:35.391
Have you determined
whether Mr. Patterson

15:35.393 --> 15:36.892
is a victim or a perpetrator?

15:36.894 --> 15:39.695
Not yet, but I'm following him.

15:39.697 --> 15:41.297
I'll meet you.

15:41.299 --> 15:44.000
You're trying to stop
a gang war, remember?

15:47.937 --> 15:50.473
_

15:54.044 --> 15:58.030
♪ _

15:58.181 --> 16:00.281
_

16:10.670 --> 16:15.106
So now that you know
all of my retirement plans,

16:15.108 --> 16:16.674
what has the man in the suit

16:16.676 --> 16:20.712
got planned after
he hangs up the suit?

16:20.714 --> 16:23.448
I haven't given it
much thought.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.716
Don't play with me, John.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.017
I just cleaned
my service weapon.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.252
Now, spill.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.760
There is no after
for people like us.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.465
No beach for you

16:41.467 --> 16:46.370
and no retirement for me.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.705
We don't do fairy tales.

16:51.743 --> 16:53.042
That's how we're built.

16:53.044 --> 16:57.414
You don't really believe that.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.116
Tell me something.

17:00.118 --> 17:02.318
How'd you wind up here
in the first place?

17:02.320 --> 17:04.053
I'm pretty sure
you drove us here.

17:04.055 --> 17:08.992
No, here, in this car,
drinking cold coffee,

17:08.993 --> 17:12.162
stalking a bar owner
in the middle of the night.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.729
Well, where else should I be?

17:13.731 --> 17:14.964
You went to law school.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.800
How about a corner
office downtown?

17:16.801 --> 17:19.801
Thank you for proving my point.

17:19.804 --> 17:22.069
I started off on one path,

17:22.071 --> 17:23.571
but I changed,

17:23.574 --> 17:26.442
because that wasn't
the end game for me, John.

17:26.444 --> 17:27.676
You can change too.

17:32.982 --> 17:34.850
No one changes, Carter.

17:34.852 --> 17:38.987
You're here because this is
where you were always headed.

17:38.989 --> 17:42.390
"No one changes," says the man

17:42.392 --> 17:45.460
who was a hobo
the first night I met him.

17:45.462 --> 17:46.795
You might not have changed,

17:46.797 --> 17:48.831
but your wardrobe has.

17:48.833 --> 17:51.632
So whatever path you were on,

17:51.634 --> 17:55.703
you took a detour.

17:55.705 --> 18:00.607
Yeah, but I'll get
where I'm going soon enough.

18:00.609 --> 18:04.345
And what does that mean?

18:07.449 --> 18:09.182
Hey, good news.

18:09.184 --> 18:10.851
Glasses told me
to bring you dinner.

18:12.654 --> 18:15.856
Am I interrupting something?

18:15.858 --> 18:18.659
No, but hot dogs
aren't dinner, Fusco,

18:18.661 --> 18:20.527
not for normal people.

18:20.529 --> 18:24.331
Guess it's the thought
that counts.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.732
You don't want my help?
No problem.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.300
I got better places to be.

18:27.302 --> 18:28.534
Good luck with this one.

18:34.642 --> 18:36.809
What did you mean, John?

18:36.811 --> 18:38.979
I just meant
things tend to work out

18:38.981 --> 18:43.649
the way they're supposed to.

18:43.651 --> 18:48.988
All right.
Whatever you like.

18:48.990 --> 18:50.423
And what does that mean?

18:50.425 --> 18:53.593
It means there are
two kinds of friends,

18:53.595 --> 18:55.862
ones you talk about
the game with

18:55.864 --> 18:57.763
and ones you share
your life with--

18:57.765 --> 18:59.831
the real stories.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.567
Up to you which one
you want me to be.

19:04.071 --> 19:06.372
But you need to decide,

19:06.374 --> 19:12.344
because, for a spy,
lying isn't your strong suit.

20:04.628 --> 20:07.097
Someone here?

20:07.099 --> 20:08.999
Chase.

20:12.504 --> 20:15.572
I just came here to talk.

20:21.279 --> 20:24.747
Why don't you come out
where I can see you?

20:37.660 --> 20:39.261
- Carter.
- Better get back here.

20:39.263 --> 20:41.163
I can't.
I think Chase was here.

20:41.165 --> 20:42.798
Not unless you're at JFK.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.700
The kid took off
on a flight to Paris

20:44.702 --> 20:46.335
an hour ago.

20:46.337 --> 20:47.503
And we caught a new one.

20:47.505 --> 20:49.705
Domestic gone wrong,
Lower East Side.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.273
No, what about the Pattersons?

20:51.275 --> 20:53.375
I'm sorry, Carter.
You're breaking up.

20:54.442 --> 20:55.674
_

21:06.490 --> 21:07.489
Detective.

21:07.491 --> 21:09.657
Oh!

21:09.659 --> 21:11.726
It isn't wise
to sneak up on people.

21:11.728 --> 21:15.530
I wasn't sneaking.
This is my place.

21:15.532 --> 21:17.665
But those drugs aren't mine.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.134
What do you mean?

21:19.136 --> 21:22.370
I mean someone
must've put them there.

21:22.372 --> 21:24.539
Someone?
Who?

21:47.428 --> 21:50.864
Phil, what's going on?

21:50.866 --> 21:53.900
It's Gil, not Phil,

21:53.902 --> 21:57.170
and that's the last time
you're gonna make that mistake,

21:57.172 --> 21:58.438
brother.

22:00.239 --> 22:01.740
Brother?

22:01.742 --> 22:03.508
Not that I'm proud
to call a drug addict loser

22:03.510 --> 22:04.910
my brother.

22:04.912 --> 22:06.679
Probably got that
from your mother's side.

22:06.681 --> 22:07.713
You're saying
my father--

22:07.715 --> 22:10.415
Our father!

22:10.417 --> 22:12.051
He knew my mom in high school.

22:12.053 --> 22:14.119
He was real nice to her
till he knocked her up.

22:14.121 --> 22:18.256
That's who our father was.

22:18.258 --> 22:20.725
And because of that,
you killed him

22:20.727 --> 22:23.128
and my entire family.

22:23.130 --> 22:26.030
What about my family?

22:26.032 --> 22:30.302
When my mom died, I had nobody,

22:30.304 --> 22:32.971
so I tracked my father down,

22:32.973 --> 22:35.073
but he had a new family,

22:35.075 --> 22:39.543
and he tried
paying me to go away.

22:39.545 --> 22:44.082
Any father who
would give up his son twice

22:44.084 --> 22:47.819
doesn't deserve
to have a family.

22:47.821 --> 22:50.221
Why not kill me too?

22:50.223 --> 22:52.323
Oh, I planned to,

22:52.325 --> 22:55.426
but you went away.

22:55.428 --> 23:00.797
And I had to bide my time
for seven years,

23:00.799 --> 23:04.635
and now I get to watch you
kill yourself.

23:04.637 --> 23:06.302
Sit.

23:12.009 --> 23:13.476
Pick up the pills.

23:18.015 --> 23:19.415
Swallow them.

23:32.929 --> 23:36.766
I give you about
eight hours to live.

23:36.768 --> 23:39.301
There's no need to be scared.

23:39.303 --> 23:42.204
I'll be sitting
right here with you.

23:42.206 --> 23:46.041
I'll be watching
every minute of your death.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.948
Detective.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.017
You cops sure have a knack

23:56.019 --> 23:59.520
for showing up
at the wrong time.

23:59.522 --> 24:03.391
Your colleague,
that lady detective,

24:03.393 --> 24:06.327
she interrupted me too.

24:06.329 --> 24:10.065
Back then, I was
too scared to kill a cop.

24:10.067 --> 24:13.367
You know, she got shot
last year anyway?

24:13.369 --> 24:14.803
Goes to show,
I should've killed her

24:14.805 --> 24:16.337
when I had the chance.

24:16.339 --> 24:21.975
When your number's up--
well, you know the saying.

24:42.530 --> 24:44.865
Can't dig a hole
without a shovel.

24:44.867 --> 24:46.934
Don't you go anywhere.

25:23.437 --> 25:27.174
You're not cold?
I'm freezing here.

25:27.176 --> 25:31.378
So we're talking
about the weather now?

25:31.380 --> 25:34.947
Fine, what do you want
to talk about, Carter?

25:34.949 --> 25:37.484
It's not what
I want to talk about.

25:37.486 --> 25:40.953
It's what I'm willing
to talk about if you want to.

25:48.028 --> 25:49.662
The night we met,

25:49.664 --> 25:53.399
transit picked you up
on the J train at Canal.

25:53.401 --> 25:56.836
So maybe you were going

25:56.838 --> 26:00.173
to pay a traffic ticket
at 3:00 AM,

26:00.175 --> 26:03.642
or maybe you were
going to take a walk

26:03.644 --> 26:06.378
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

26:06.380 --> 26:09.081
Is that the path
you were talking about?

26:27.700 --> 26:30.035
Her name was Jessica,

26:30.037 --> 26:34.072
although I think
you already know that.

26:34.074 --> 26:37.342
She liked the rain,

26:37.344 --> 26:40.678
sleeping in.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.115
She told really bad jokes

26:44.117 --> 26:49.420
and called me out
when I pretended to enjoy them.

26:49.422 --> 26:53.858
And her laugh--

26:53.860 --> 26:57.094
God, I loved her laugh.

26:58.864 --> 27:01.632
You can't blame yourself
for what happened to her, John.

27:01.634 --> 27:06.637
It's not a question of blame.
It's a fact.

27:06.639 --> 27:09.105
She needed me,
and I left her behind.

27:09.107 --> 27:10.807
Can I ask why?

27:14.712 --> 27:17.814
I thought I wasn't
gonna make it back alive.

27:17.816 --> 27:19.616
She deserved a better life

27:19.618 --> 27:23.654
than waiting to become a widow.

27:23.656 --> 27:26.322
She deserved happiness.

27:30.127 --> 27:33.096
Not quite how
it worked out, though.

27:33.098 --> 27:34.563
Sorry, John.

27:39.670 --> 27:41.136
But I'm not buying it.

27:43.407 --> 27:45.574
You may be able to fool
your police shrink

27:45.576 --> 27:50.979
with that version,
maybe even yourself.

27:50.981 --> 27:52.581
But not you, huh?

27:52.583 --> 27:56.852
No, you're forgetting,
I was over there too.

27:56.854 --> 27:58.287
You'd already
been deployed once

27:58.289 --> 28:00.022
when you broke things off.

28:00.024 --> 28:03.025
Hell, you were already
active military when you met,

28:03.027 --> 28:05.427
so you want to tell me
what really happened?

28:05.429 --> 28:07.129
What does it matter now?

28:07.131 --> 28:09.698
It matters because
I'm afraid you're gonna use

28:09.700 --> 28:11.700
this poor woman
to shut everybody out

28:11.702 --> 28:13.868
right until the bitter end,

28:13.870 --> 28:15.636
because whatever it is
you're not telling me,

28:15.638 --> 28:19.440
that's the real reason
why you're alone, John.

28:19.442 --> 28:23.610
And because time
is running out.

28:23.612 --> 28:27.648
Time?

28:27.650 --> 28:30.151
Hell, we got all the time
in the world.

28:30.153 --> 28:31.684
Benny's asleep.

28:31.686 --> 28:33.854
Be hours before Finch
brings us breakfast.

28:33.856 --> 28:36.289
No, listen to me, John.

28:36.291 --> 28:40.193
Your time is running out.

28:43.664 --> 28:47.300
You're dying, John.

28:47.302 --> 28:48.534
What?

29:17.530 --> 29:19.231
I don't understand.

29:19.233 --> 29:21.566
You got him, John,

29:21.568 --> 29:25.504
the monster that killed
Chase's family,

29:25.506 --> 29:27.406
and he got you pretty good too.

29:27.408 --> 29:29.708
You managed to get
to Chase's car.

29:29.710 --> 29:32.411
You need to get help,
and if you don't,

29:32.413 --> 29:36.481
you're going to die,
and so is Chase.

29:36.482 --> 29:38.691
_

29:42.220 --> 29:43.853
I lost some blood,
but I don't think

29:43.855 --> 29:45.889
I'll bleed out
before they get here.

29:45.891 --> 29:48.458
Before who gets here?

29:48.460 --> 29:52.429
Fusco, Finch, maybe Root.

29:52.431 --> 29:54.197
You forgetting?

29:54.199 --> 29:57.067
You didn't tell anybody
you were coming up here.

29:57.069 --> 29:58.535
True to form,

29:58.537 --> 30:01.304
you didn't reach out,

30:01.306 --> 30:03.706
so I'm afraid, John,
it's just me and you.

30:03.708 --> 30:05.608
But you're right.

30:05.610 --> 30:09.278
You probably won't
bleed to death.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.981
It's the cold
that'll kill you first,

30:11.983 --> 30:15.318
unless you do
something about it.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.786
You need to get
those keys, John.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.326
Hey, Glasses.

30:23.328 --> 30:25.294
That info from Carlo
lead to anything?

30:25.296 --> 30:27.563
Sadly, no, and I've been
trying unsuccessfully

30:27.565 --> 30:29.165
to reach Mr. Reese.

30:29.167 --> 30:30.799
Yeah, well, good luck.

30:30.801 --> 30:32.668
I haven't seen or heard
from the coiffed Columbo

30:32.670 --> 30:33.769
since this morning.

30:33.771 --> 30:34.803
Really?

30:34.805 --> 30:36.104
Why, something got you worried?

30:36.106 --> 30:38.006
Nothing in particular.

30:38.008 --> 30:39.775
Where was he last time
you guys talked?

30:39.777 --> 30:41.777
Following Chase Patterson.

30:41.779 --> 30:44.580
Patterson-- that's
the case Wonder Boy pulled?

30:44.582 --> 30:45.981
I'm afraid so.

30:45.983 --> 30:47.649
Well, if you do hear from him,

30:47.651 --> 30:49.017
will you let me know?

30:49.019 --> 30:51.319
Yeah, sure thing.

31:01.097 --> 31:02.864
You worry too much, Harry.

31:02.866 --> 31:04.265
I'm sure wherever he is,

31:04.267 --> 31:06.433
the big lug
can take care of himself.

31:25.154 --> 31:26.853
All right, keep it moving.

31:26.855 --> 31:29.723
You know how this works--
you stop, you die.

31:29.725 --> 31:34.594
Come on, you've seen
worse than this.

31:34.596 --> 31:37.164
You didn't really
survive all of that

31:37.166 --> 31:39.799
to just wind up dying now,

31:39.801 --> 31:43.236
out here, alone,
at the hands of a psycho

31:43.238 --> 31:47.741
who got off one lucky shot.

31:47.743 --> 31:49.308
I didn't think so.

31:59.019 --> 32:00.253
Attaboy, John.

32:00.255 --> 32:03.822
I knew you could do it.

32:03.824 --> 32:05.691
You sure you were
an interrogator,

32:05.693 --> 32:07.360
not a drill sergeant?

32:07.362 --> 32:10.563
I thought you liked
following orders.

32:10.565 --> 32:12.264
Now, you think
you can make it back?

32:24.445 --> 32:27.046
Gonna bleed to death.

32:27.048 --> 32:30.081
Least I'm gonna listen
to some good music.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.050
At least we can agree
on this one.

32:35.889 --> 32:37.889
♪ the wind blows memories
through my hall ♪

32:37.891 --> 32:41.125
I missed you.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.061
That's good.

32:43.063 --> 32:45.463
Being missed means
you meant something to people

32:45.465 --> 32:48.899
while you were here.

32:48.901 --> 32:49.900
So...

32:51.036 --> 32:53.471
You're a cop now?

32:53.473 --> 32:55.806
- Not a real one.
- No?

32:55.808 --> 32:58.209
Well, that shield
looks pretty real.

32:58.211 --> 33:01.244
And so does the dead
bad guy in the snow.

33:01.246 --> 33:06.149
Even got you a partner.
Poor Fusco.

33:09.488 --> 33:13.223
Mm.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.393
♪ at midnight they will all ♪

33:18.430 --> 33:21.164
Wait.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.133
What are we still doing here?

33:23.135 --> 33:25.168
I can drive us back.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.902
John, listen to me.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.971
There's something wrong
with this heater.

33:28.973 --> 33:30.640
- No, there's not.
- I'm burning up in here.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.409
Why can I see your breath?

33:33.411 --> 33:36.912
It's not too hot.
It's too cold.

33:41.985 --> 33:44.854
Engine won't start.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.256
Cars don't like the cold.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.529
Come on, John.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.830
You know this.

33:55.832 --> 33:59.668
The heat you're
feeling is a hallucination,

33:59.670 --> 34:02.437
the last symptom
of hypothermia.

34:02.439 --> 34:04.606
You're freezing to death, John.

34:18.382 --> 34:21.484
John.
John!

34:22.786 --> 34:25.487
You got to stay awake.
Concentrate.

34:27.556 --> 34:30.826
Where are you going?

34:30.828 --> 34:34.130
The highway.
I can flag down a car.

34:34.132 --> 34:37.065
That's the hypothermia talking.
You're confused.

34:37.067 --> 34:41.003
I'm not.
Look, here comes one.

34:41.005 --> 34:44.774
Step out of this car,
and you die.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.812
But the light.

34:49.813 --> 34:53.415
That's not headlights.
That's the moon.

34:55.618 --> 34:57.485
The moon?

34:57.487 --> 34:59.654
The storm passed.

35:10.265 --> 35:12.634
No one's coming.

35:18.441 --> 35:23.010
He's really got you worried,
doesn't he, Harry?

35:23.012 --> 35:25.480
John has always
maintained a certain distance,

35:25.482 --> 35:27.681
but this is not like him.

35:27.683 --> 35:31.352
So have you found anything?

35:31.354 --> 35:33.120
I managed to isolate
the location

35:33.122 --> 35:35.622
of his phone's last connection
to our mesh network.

35:35.624 --> 35:38.725
Unfortunately the signal
was lost soon after,

35:38.727 --> 35:41.963
and I have no other means
of determining his location.

35:47.635 --> 35:48.836
I'm sorry, Harry.

36:00.481 --> 36:02.682
Beautiful, isn't it?

36:04.818 --> 36:10.357
No noise, no people.

36:10.359 --> 36:11.657
Nothing.

36:15.396 --> 36:16.896
May as well tell me

36:16.898 --> 36:19.398
why you really left her behind.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.901
No point taking secrets
where you're going.

36:22.903 --> 36:24.168
Trust me.

36:31.443 --> 36:36.047
First tour--

36:36.049 --> 36:41.052
We were outside of Herat,

36:41.054 --> 36:46.391
making our way
through the mountains at night.

36:46.393 --> 36:50.395
We heard shooting.

36:50.397 --> 36:53.031
Group of Rangers

36:53.033 --> 36:57.467
stumbled into the Taliban
in the dark.

36:57.469 --> 37:00.704
And by the time we got there,
they were all dead.

37:02.641 --> 37:05.208
Both sides.

37:05.210 --> 37:07.978
Just one of those things.

37:07.980 --> 37:12.149
We had to be
over the mountains by sunrise,

37:12.151 --> 37:14.418
so we searched them,
took their tags,

37:14.420 --> 37:15.718
their water, their ammunition,

37:15.720 --> 37:17.921
and we just kept moving.

37:17.923 --> 37:23.226
And I noticed something.

37:23.228 --> 37:28.164
They all had a picture--

37:28.166 --> 37:33.269
girlfriend, wife, kid.

37:33.271 --> 37:37.406
After a while, I realized

37:37.408 --> 37:41.578
everybody I found,
on either side, had a picture.

37:41.580 --> 37:43.512
They were fighting
for something.

37:43.514 --> 37:46.748
They were dying for something.

37:51.421 --> 37:53.322
I figured maybe
if I didn't have a picture

37:53.324 --> 37:57.793
to carry around with me

37:57.795 --> 38:02.931
I'd be better at my job,

38:02.933 --> 38:07.936
so when I got back,

38:07.938 --> 38:10.371
I broke things off
with Jessica.

38:13.175 --> 38:17.345
Maybe you're right, then.

38:17.347 --> 38:20.648
Maybe this is the path
you've been on all along,

38:20.650 --> 38:24.819
path that led you right here.

38:24.821 --> 38:30.391
Don't reach out to anyone,
shut everybody out.

38:30.393 --> 38:34.561
- Not everyone.
- What?

38:34.563 --> 38:36.897
I didn't shut you out.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.568
We had a connection.

38:41.570 --> 38:45.372
I could talk with you
about important things,

38:45.374 --> 38:49.976
the things
that really mattered.

38:52.347 --> 38:55.081
But, John,

38:55.083 --> 38:56.883
you never did.

38:59.987 --> 39:03.223
What?
Of course I did.

39:05.226 --> 39:10.229
That night we
were staking out the bar.

39:10.231 --> 39:12.699
- We talked.
- Yes, we talked about music.

39:12.701 --> 39:14.701
- Our jobs.
- And Jessica.

39:14.703 --> 39:15.935
No, John.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.771
Yes, I told you about her,

39:17.773 --> 39:20.239
how she liked the rain
and sleeping in.

39:20.241 --> 39:23.008
I wish we'd had
that conversation,

39:23.010 --> 39:25.077
but we never did.

39:27.847 --> 39:29.882
Here, this picture.

39:29.884 --> 39:31.217
Remember?

39:31.219 --> 39:33.719
You kept this,
and you gave it to me

39:33.721 --> 39:35.688
when we talked about her
that night.

39:35.690 --> 39:40.893
I kept the photo,
but I never gave it to you.

39:40.895 --> 39:43.729
You were talking
about a path you were on.

39:43.731 --> 39:45.197
I asked if you wanted
to talk about it,

39:45.199 --> 39:49.034
and you didn't.

39:49.036 --> 39:50.268
- I did.
- No.

39:50.270 --> 39:52.037
You cracked a couple jokes.

39:52.039 --> 39:53.371
Then you turned the radio up,

39:53.373 --> 39:54.372
and that was it.

39:54.374 --> 39:56.708
We never got to Jessica.

39:59.945 --> 40:03.915
I kept that photo

40:03.917 --> 40:06.784
to give to you
at the right moment,

40:06.786 --> 40:11.456
when you were willing to share
that part of yourself with me,

40:11.458 --> 40:13.725
but you never were, John.

40:18.731 --> 40:20.598
It's like you said.

40:20.600 --> 40:25.803
You're here because
you were always headed here.

40:25.805 --> 40:30.841
I wanted to talk to you
about her.

40:33.978 --> 40:35.746
I just wish we had more time.

40:35.748 --> 40:40.451
Yeah, well, that's something
we never get enough of.

40:46.023 --> 40:50.493
You're right.

40:50.495 --> 40:53.830
I don't let people in.

40:53.832 --> 40:59.535
That's not why I didn't
tell anyone about the case.

40:59.537 --> 41:01.871
I wanted to close
this one myself.

41:01.873 --> 41:03.873
- Just me.
- Why?

41:06.777 --> 41:10.313
It was a chance
to be close to you again.

41:16.954 --> 41:21.223
And I didn't want to share that
with anyone else.

41:28.031 --> 41:31.633
There's another reason why
I kept that photo.

41:31.635 --> 41:34.569
It was a side of you
I hadn't seen.

41:37.373 --> 41:42.977
Happy, hopeful.

41:42.979 --> 41:45.180
In love.

41:45.182 --> 41:47.048
You can feel
that way again, John.

41:47.050 --> 41:49.918
You just got to hold on.

41:49.920 --> 41:54.022
There are people
who care about you,

41:54.024 --> 41:56.691
who can love you.

41:56.693 --> 41:59.260
Just got to let them in.

41:59.262 --> 42:02.163
It's like what
you told me before--

42:02.165 --> 42:05.366
whether I liked it or not,

42:05.368 --> 42:08.502
I wasn't alone.

42:08.504 --> 42:10.003
Neither are you.

42:19.581 --> 42:22.783
Will you stay with me
just for a little bit?

42:22.785 --> 42:26.753
Yes, of course.

42:26.755 --> 42:29.756
Just hold on, John.
