WEBVTT

00:24.649 --> 00:25.483
Lommie?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.861
Lommie

00:29.112 --> 00:29.946
Lommie?

00:30.655 --> 00:32.073
Lommie? Hey! Hey.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.116
Hey.

00:33.950 --> 00:34.868
Hey.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.495
What are you doing?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.289
I'm sorry. You weren't...

00:39.372 --> 00:41.332
You know, I'm...
Don't do that when I'm deep.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.668
You went back inside the Crystal Matrix?

00:44.377 --> 00:45.962
No, just outside of it.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.631
I'm putting patches
on the firewalls Eris set up.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.758
How long were you in for?

00:50.842 --> 00:51.968
Hours.

00:52.677 --> 00:53.803
-I need to sleep.
-Hey.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.555
You said we wouldn't need
any more firewalls

00:55.638 --> 00:56.848
once Cynthia was trapped.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.350
Yeah, I'm just making sure.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.621
Did you get this from the crew?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.123
No, that one is strange.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.543
It feels like it came from somewhere else.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.795
Like, from outside the ship.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.136
Maybe you should get some air?

02:58.219 --> 02:59.596
Captain Eris trusts you.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.765
He gave you explicit permission
to roam the ship at will.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.143
-And do what?
-I don't know.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.436
Meet some people.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.396
You mean, like, make friends?

03:10.189 --> 03:12.650
You've seen what they all think of me.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.070
You're making it really hard for me
to feel sorry for you.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.822
Oh, you think that's what I want?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.412
I think it's what you need

03:24.495 --> 03:27.123
in order to justify
that self-pity you're holding onto.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.209
Let it go, Thale.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.464
You missed a spot.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.758
There.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.302
Suit yourself.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.389
I will.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.568
Hey, you see this?

03:55.652 --> 03:56.986
We're picking up organics outside.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.872
You know,
you can order anything you want?

04:09.165 --> 04:11.042
What was your favorite restaurant
as a kid?

04:12.126 --> 04:13.127
Um...

04:13.753 --> 04:16.714
My mom took us to a place
called Silver Spurs once.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.425
I remember getting the Downtown Dog.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.510
It was really gross.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.805
Downtown Dog
from Silver Spurs restaurant circa...

04:23.888 --> 04:25.139
'77, I guess.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.891
Circa 2077.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.019
Oh, and a water, please.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.611
Whoa.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.698
They even got the little paper tray right.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.118
-Oh, thanks.
-What's it like?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.037
Porting.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.247
I've always wondered.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.544
Imagine listening to your favorite music,

04:54.627 --> 04:56.713
only you're not really listening,

04:56.796 --> 04:58.756
but instead, you are the instrument.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.551
Sounds strange.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.763
Well, I think people are strange.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.850
How is Roy doing
with his mommy thing?

05:08.933 --> 05:09.809
Hm.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.769
He's been spending time
in her old bedroom.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.023
Well, we've all got parental issues.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.443
His mom never let him control anything.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.445
Now is his chance to shine.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.113
Is she not a bad person?

05:23.656 --> 05:24.657
Cynthia Eris.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.952
You should've been here
the year she built the outer ring.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.080
There was an electricity on the ship.
We knew we were doing something important.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.290
Something good.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.126
Here comes the condemnation part.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.005
I respect what Captain Eris is doing,
and D'Branin.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.256
They're good men.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.925
But if Cynthia were alive,

05:43.009 --> 05:46.095
we wouldn't be crossing the void
with so many people back on Earth.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.892
I'm sorry. It's not my place.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.686
Mm.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.813
There's something going on
with the sensor.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.148
Excuse me.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.738
Well, he obviously doesn't know
the truth about Cynthia.

06:07.825 --> 06:08.993
-Willa.
-Sir.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.036
Show me.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.754
Is the sensor bad? Have it replaced.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.589
We swapped three of them out already.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.884
You're telling me
we're picking up organic compound?

06:24.967 --> 06:26.219
Out here? It's not possible.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.804
Nothing lives in the void.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.433
The crew were wondering,
perhaps the Volcryn ship?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.730
Well, it can't be the Volcryn.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.148
They're still too far away.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.250
Captain Eris?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.221
What is it, Auggie?

07:10.555 --> 07:11.430
Sir, I'm...

07:13.891 --> 07:16.936
We're picking up streams
of organic compound outside the ship.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.689
Distribution suggests
it's coming off a moving object.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.774
What are you suggesting?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.317
The Volcryn?

07:23.651 --> 07:26.070
-No, sir. We're still too far.
-Then it's an error.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.573
No other ship has ever made it this far.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.713
How did it get here?

07:44.422 --> 07:45.548
It's enormous.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.260
Better get Karl.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.785
How long has it been there?

08:15.203 --> 08:16.287
It's moving.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.581
We've adjusted our velocity
to match their speed.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.833
How is that possible all the way out here?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.503
Apparently, it's on our exact trajectory.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.379
What

08:25.796 --> 08:26.964
It's one of ours.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.300
An older ship, Eagle class.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.593
Eagle 16.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.722
We studied this.
She broke apart in the ice fields.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.141
Part of our Europa Project.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.894
Your failed Europa Project.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.023
That's not what happened, is it?

08:44.732 --> 08:47.109
We lost contact when they entered
the Jupiter gravity field.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.362
No one knows what happened after that.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.822
Oh, so there could be survivors?

08:51.906 --> 08:54.283
Eagles could carry
40 months of provisions.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.078
That ship has been adrift
for nearly 14 years.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.789
Spooky.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.332
Wait a minute.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.879
That ship operates off a Crystal Matrix,

09:06.963 --> 09:08.381
just like the Nightflyer.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.592
If this is about my mother,
we've already taken care of that problem.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.135
No, not permanently.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.805
And Lommie is consistently patching up
all the firewalls.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.265
How long is that going to hold her?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.308
Sorry, sir. I'm not following.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.525
My mother, Auggie,

09:29.360 --> 09:30.695
she never left the ship.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.280
Sir?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.490
When she passed,

09:34.865 --> 09:36.701
she left her body, but not the Nightflyer.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.037
Her spirit resides inside our Crystal.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.957
I couldn't say anything.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.917
How could the crew understand?

09:46.752 --> 09:47.878
I'm sorry.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.257
Of course.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.220
Roy, we need to get your mother
off this ship.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.390
The Crystal Matrix on the Eagle,

09:59.640 --> 10:01.892
if it's still functioning,
we could swap it out

10:01.976 --> 10:03.352
with ours on the Nightflyer.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.520
Your mother won't be harmed.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.607
And she won't be able to hurt anyone
and she'll be able to live there forever.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.901
She'll be alone.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.278
She'll be alive.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.113
As will we.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.038
I want Mel to lead.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.790
We'll have to set a guideline
to get the boarding party across.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.043
The Nightflyer wasn't designed
for ship-to-ship transfer.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.669
And Auggie,

10:28.753 --> 10:30.421
he's familiar with the Eagle class ships.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.256
I'll stay here with the Nightflyer.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.800
I'll lock the ship to the offset position.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.886
The closest I can get us is 600 meters.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.179
I'm coming.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.641
I'll bring Lommie with me
to assess the viability of the Crystal.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.142
-Okay.
-And Rowan.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.270
Uh, I'm a biologist.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.105
Look, we don't know how an abandoned ship

10:48.189 --> 10:49.857
is on the same intercept as the Volcryn,

10:49.940 --> 10:51.108
-so I need you.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.153
All right. How exactly
are we getting there?

10:59.033 --> 11:00.326
Ready to depressurize.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.161
Releasing pressure.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.456
In three, two, one.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.652
We've reached the airlock
on Eagle 16.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.153
Preparing to board.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.489
About to lose visual contact.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.033
Opening the port hatch.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.291
Artificial gravity still working.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.127
And they still have power.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.754
Captain Eris. We are on the Eagle.
Do you copy?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.549
We're inside the Eagle, do you copy?

11:56.632 --> 11:58.134
Probably out of range.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.511
These suits were designed
for orbital maintenance.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.596
Then we'll proceed without comms.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.809
Environmental systems are on, too.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.978
-Temperature.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.020
Contaminates.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.772
The air is safe to breathe.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.817
We shouldn't take our helmets off.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.529
You can't be certain
that those readings are accurate.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.573
Or if their Crystal is still operational.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.784
Conserving the air in our suits
buys us the time to find out.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.412
There's no point carrying
the extra weight, anyway.

12:33.794 --> 12:34.837
As I said,

12:35.921 --> 12:37.089
the air is safe.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.555
You're going to hurt yourself,
acting like that.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.932
Yeah, only that I don't care anymore.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.936
The air in here...

12:52.396 --> 12:53.272
smells like...

12:53.355 --> 12:54.190
Death.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.107
We need to move.

13:25.804 --> 13:30.100
Every Eris ship was designed
from the same core layout.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.899
The Crystal will be
on a lower deck.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.778
What happened here?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.083
They must have,
uh, been living here.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.501
Maybe it was warmer?

13:56.126 --> 13:57.419
I wonder what killed them.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.630
Looks like each other.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.551
There was definitely a fight here.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.053
When the food ran out.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.017
Where are all the bodies?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.563
Uh, please wait for me.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.748
-I'll go.
-I'll back you up.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.861
Get ready.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.285
It's okay!

15:22.254 --> 15:23.589
Judson Smith.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
The captain.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.343
Why hang the suit?

15:27.426 --> 15:32.389
The use of a totem or an effigy
is meant to signify control.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.683
But what happened to him?

15:37.394 --> 15:38.562
Are you angels?

15:38.646 --> 15:39.772
There's another one.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.024
There are two more!

16:00.584 --> 16:01.502
Who are you?

16:01.877 --> 16:02.878
We're travelers.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.005
Here to help.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.674
We don't need help here.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.217
We're doing fine.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.513
I'm Karl D'Branin.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.766
We're from the Nightflyer.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.851
The Nightflyer?

16:21.563 --> 16:22.648
Come with me.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.111
Come on.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.872
How did we lose communication?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.959
As soon as they entered the Eagle airlock,
their comms went dead.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.335
Is this an external phenomenon?

16:43.419 --> 16:45.879
Well, that's what we thought at first,
but it seems like someone

16:45.963 --> 16:48.132
-is jamming the signal.
-Someone on the Eagle?

16:48.215 --> 16:49.633
Okay, how do we un-jam it?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.261
Sir, the Nightflyer doesn't have
this type of capability.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.055
I understand our capabilities!
I'm asking you to improvise.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.989
-We have visitors.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.199
Travelers from the Nightflyer.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.877
Your tech. Everything...

17:25.753 --> 17:27.296
Lost in the fight.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.714
Useless, anyways.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.383
We run our environment
off the auxiliary grid.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.343
Minimal energy use.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.428
Simple and efficient.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.554
More stable.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.098
Have you ever calculated

17:38.182 --> 17:41.060
how much energy is wasted running
a food synthesizer?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.397
Going back to the land, I see.

17:47.775 --> 17:48.984
For years, we drifted.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.779
Working to survive,

17:51.862 --> 17:54.823
to keep life burning out here
in the ocean of nothing.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.703
We prayed
that someone would come replenish us,

17:59.787 --> 18:01.205
to bring new life.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.915
And here you are.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.459
We're happy to have found you.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.880
Hope is alive in you.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.215
I see that.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.592
And you as well.

18:14.551 --> 18:17.638
Sit with us.
Eat and rejoice this marvelous occurrence.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.473
Well, thank you
for your generosity.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.609
You must have exhausted your supplies
of base proteins years ago.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.570
All the women you see here are scientists,

18:33.654 --> 18:35.614
geneticists, biochemists.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.408
But more than that,
we're farmers.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.702
We grow everything we eat.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.703
Try it.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.331
That's why we were on this ship
in the first place,

18:44.540 --> 18:49.044
the first wave of technicians
destined to spark a new seed of life.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.129
I know you.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.798
You're Constance Brighthead.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.842
Wow.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.636
She created
the replacement technique

18:57.719 --> 18:59.054
-in RNA splicing.
-RNA splicing.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.182
I'm from the Academy.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.601
You built half my genetic architecture.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.270
Stand up for me.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.064
Let me look at you.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.989
Magnificent.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.993
We've had debates
on sustaining environments.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.328
No one thought it was possible.
Not out here.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.454
Your ship.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.456
I don't understand what happened.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.334
Eagle 16 was never lost.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.419
It was hijacked.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.171
We saw signs of a fight.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.755
Our captain.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.091
As we approached Jupiter,

19:36.967 --> 19:38.468
he commandeered the ship

19:38.552 --> 19:41.096
and used the gravitational pull
to throw us into the void.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.349
His dream was to create
a self-sustaining system,

19:45.100 --> 19:47.978
drifting across the void
like a dandelion seed

19:48.478 --> 19:50.856
to eventually land
and grow on some new world.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.775
Jud Smith wanted
a world of his own.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.529
He became obsessed with power and control,

19:58.280 --> 19:59.990
and convinced his crew to follow.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.117
Where are the other men?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.453
They killed themselves.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.413
Power begets greed.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.748
Greed corrupts.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.333
Violence becomes a contagion.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.795
It wasn't until all the men were gone
that we achieved balance.

20:14.796 --> 20:15.839
Harmony.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.969
Excuse me.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.358
Lommie? Lommie, hey, hey.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.653
-What's wrong?
-This is bad.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.780
The way they talk.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.660
Did you see the way they...

20:45.118 --> 20:46.203
they looked at her?

20:49.122 --> 20:50.374
I've seen this before.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.377
I lived it.

20:54.836 --> 20:55.879
Lommie,

20:56.505 --> 20:57.798
are you all right?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.051
Yeah, I'm just not feeling well.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.429
Your oxygen mix is pretty thin.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.973
She'll be fine.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.688
Quiet.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.440
One of us.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.445
Fourteen years in the void.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.530
Oh.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.366
No terraform, no sunlight. No one has...

21:25.492 --> 21:29.705
ever successfully run
a fully enclosed system for so long.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.164
Yes, and we could keep going.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.166
We replenish what we use.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.377
We only use what we need.
And we work together.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.338
All these women you see around us,

21:38.422 --> 21:39.589
I picked them myself.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.217
They're the toughest and brightest.
My Sisters.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.802
It's unbelievable, really.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.846
I'd love to see how you do it,

21:45.929 --> 21:47.681
if you don't mind sharing
what you've learned?

21:47.764 --> 21:49.433
She didn't learn this, Karl.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.311
She invented it.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.147
I am always learning.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.190
That's what makes life interesting.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.109
Come on.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.364
I'm sure there's so much more
for us to see.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.659
Make your way to the airlock.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.369
We need to get a message
to the Nightflyer.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.040
-Okay.
-Auggie, find their Crystal.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.627
-This is urgent.
-Okay, he's sleeping.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.796
No, I need him to reach out to Eagle 16

22:19.880 --> 22:22.883
-and make contact with our boarding party.
-You push him to reach out that far,

22:22.966 --> 22:24.634
-it could hurt him.
-He's been training.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.179
-Please, we need him to try!
-Fine, I'll take him to the bridge.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.722
If he can see them, it will help.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.476
Yeah, I couldn't sleep anyway.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.614
Did you hear
what they called them?

22:46.990 --> 22:48.116
Sisters?

22:49.701 --> 22:50.994
They're lunatics.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.121
They're out of their minds.

23:00.212 --> 23:04.341
Well, crazy and smart
is a dangerous combination.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.033
Auggie, this is a cult.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.078
I grew up with people like this on Luna.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.456
You grew up in a Luddite colony?

23:37.290 --> 23:38.500
How did you get out?

23:39.292 --> 23:40.418
My dad.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.464
He broke you out of there?

23:45.382 --> 23:46.508
He stayed quiet,

23:47.300 --> 23:48.301
saved us.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.805
He didn't make it.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.598
Sacrifice.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.892
He saw they were wrong
and couldn't leave you there.

23:57.853 --> 23:58.687
Yeah.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.021
He did the right thing.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.025
Let's find the Crystal,

24:04.442 --> 24:06.027
so we can get back to the Flyer.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.707
How did you get here?

24:18.874 --> 24:19.791
My mom.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.168
You remember on the ship?

24:22.002 --> 24:24.254
I ordered a hot dog from Silver Spurs?

24:24.337 --> 24:25.463
Yeah.

24:26.464 --> 24:27.924
My mom took us there

24:28.550 --> 24:30.051
the day we landed in New York.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.805
That was the first time I felt normal.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.603
I know what it's like
to sacrifice for someone you love.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.479
Your father was a good man.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.562
The Crystal runs off
one of these optical wires.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.939
-What a mess.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.106
Did you hear it?

25:25.690 --> 25:26.733
Did you hear that?

25:28.151 --> 25:29.402
You're just jumpy.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.781
This way.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.492
So, you're not worried about them?

25:36.284 --> 25:37.327
Nah.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.455
They don't hold a candle
to the woman who put them here.

25:41.915 --> 25:42.791
You mean Cynthia?

25:42.874 --> 25:43.875
Yeah.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.086
She's not what you think.

25:46.795 --> 25:47.921
She wasn't...

25:48.922 --> 25:50.006
isn't...

25:50.799 --> 25:51.800
bad.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.469
Just strong,

25:54.552 --> 25:55.470
like you.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.055
This way.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.614
They're not even using it.

26:22.831 --> 26:26.376
All the ship's systems
have been diverted to auxiliary networks.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.756
Wow.

26:33.591 --> 26:34.551
It's beautiful.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.228
Praise be.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.156
Fresh seed.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.294
I see them.

27:09.669 --> 27:10.837
Who?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.216
Lommie.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.095
And the bald one.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.723
Do you see anyone else?

27:29.189 --> 27:30.315
Rowan.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.025
Are they safe?

27:33.902 --> 27:35.070
Others.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.363
There are others.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.406
There are others?

27:40.700 --> 27:41.910
We should stop this.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.829
Fuck!

27:50.585 --> 27:51.711
Many others.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.881
It's too much.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.132
It's hurting him.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.926
I need to get him back to his dome.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.681
Judson's officers hoarded food.

28:03.765 --> 28:06.226
Their plan was
to starve non-essential crew.

28:08.395 --> 28:12.232
Violence is not a sustainable strategy
for survival.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.822
Hold on.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.783
There was a vid feed in progress
when they went dark.

28:21.866 --> 28:22.992
All the men dead.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.328
And they took Rubin, Wiedeman too.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.206
Crane was killed right in from of my eyes.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.250
-Scientists have taken the ship.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.295
We've got to get out
of here, Auggie.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.341
We turned to science
to restore our bodies.

28:39.759 --> 28:40.885
Then a miracle occurred.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.767
To think that Roy Eris
could condemn his own mother

28:47.851 --> 28:50.895
to a rusty tub infested with psychos.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.858
What miracle?

28:54.941 --> 28:55.984
The Shooting Star.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.945
We had been drifting for nearly a decade
when it moved into view.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.781
That's how I knew
we were on the right path.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.244
-Fresh seed.
-Stop!

29:06.327 --> 29:07.662
Fresh seed.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.205
-Fresh seed.
-Fresh seed.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.792
Lommie, go! Get out of here, now!

29:12.876 --> 29:14.919
-Fresh seed.
-Praise be.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.463
Fresh seed.

29:16.796 --> 29:20.216
The way it changed position in the sky
like no other object.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.719
It was speaking to us.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.388
You were tracking the Volcryn.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.433
-That's how we found you.
-You've been following a ship.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.893
Is that what you see?

29:30.643 --> 29:31.603
A ship?

29:32.562 --> 29:33.980
I see a miracle.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.858
We prayed to the Star

29:36.941 --> 29:39.986
to replenish our ability to harvest food

29:40.737 --> 29:41.946
and like magic,

29:42.405 --> 29:44.824
three new Givers fall out of the sky.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.036
A ship cannot do such things.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.329
Givers?

29:49.954 --> 29:51.498
What are you talking about?

29:51.581 --> 29:53.792
Our farm. Our livestock.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.630
Except for you, Mel,

30:00.507 --> 30:03.676
this system
is my most precious achievement.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.066
The Sacred Gift.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.485
It's very humane.

30:21.110 --> 30:24.739
My cloning process does not result
in conscious beings.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.700
Mindless, blind.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.327
Their eyes never open.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.996
They are merely food.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.332
Sustenance.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.543
-Hope.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.843
You're insane.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.512
Exposure to the Volcryn
has done something you don't--

30:50.849 --> 30:53.351
We mine the seed to grow the Gift.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.812
The Star brought you to us.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.356
Three of you, Givers of the seed.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.526
Believe.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.528
-Believe.
-Believe.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.242
Shit.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.578
What happened?

31:13.329 --> 31:14.414
I can't move, Rowan.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.500
They're going to kill us.

31:21.296 --> 31:24.048
Fresh seed, fresh seed.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.927
-How can we get out of here?
-He wants to get out.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.680
Augustine?

31:32.640 --> 31:33.892
Judson Smith.

31:34.851 --> 31:35.727
Yes.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.770
Wait. You were the captain?

31:37.854 --> 31:39.147
What happened?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.691
Hey, I was loyal to Eris Corp.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.651
-Most of us were.
-Okay.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.446
We were at the tip of the spear,
pushing out to Jupiter.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.115
Our cargo was genius.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.493
Twenty-four of the best scientific minds.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.538
Connie Brighthead, yeah.

31:55.997 --> 31:56.998
Connie...

31:57.957 --> 31:59.667
She had her own plans,

32:00.084 --> 32:01.836
plans beyond Europa.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.172
It was her idea to turn the Eagle

32:04.255 --> 32:06.966
into some sort
of self-sustaining paradise,

32:07.425 --> 32:09.302
some kind of a Noah's Ark thing.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.971
So, one night while we were sleeping,

32:12.221 --> 32:14.307
they rose up and they,

32:14.599 --> 32:17.101
they killed the men one by one,

32:18.186 --> 32:20.730
except for a few Givers.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.149
-What?

32:23.232 --> 32:24.609
Here she comes.

32:24.692 --> 32:25.735
It's time.

32:25.818 --> 32:28.196
-Morning, Givers.
-Morning, Ruthanne.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.864
Oh, praise be.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.533
Good.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.994
Very good, yes.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.540
Oh, my, let's look at you.

32:41.376 --> 32:42.543
Wow.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.337
High quality,

32:44.921 --> 32:46.839
high volume, I imagine.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.341
Excuse me?

32:50.718 --> 32:51.886
Ruthanne?

32:52.387 --> 32:53.596
Ruthanne?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.516
Ruthanne, can you...

32:56.808 --> 32:58.643
Can you give my neck
a little squeeze?

32:58.726 --> 33:00.311
Stop asking that.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.605
It makes it go faster.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.232
Faster reduces yield, Judson.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.109
You know that, I've told you that.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.320
That's it, there. That's it.

33:09.737 --> 33:10.905
Good.

33:12.198 --> 33:13.491
Too strong, it hurts.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.037
That's it.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.456
The timing really couldn't be better.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.292
Judson, bless his heart,

33:23.376 --> 33:26.129
after all these years,
he's running a little dry.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.132
Don't worry.

33:30.091 --> 33:33.052
It gets easier each and every time,
I promise.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.680
That's good, Judson. That's good.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.738
-Ooh.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.822
Good.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.657
Very good.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.247
You know,
there are many other ways.

34:01.330 --> 34:04.959
There are many, many other ways
we can do this.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.420
Hey, don't resist.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.839
She'll turn it on stronger
if you fight.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.594
Just relax and enjoy it.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.530
No, just leave me.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.240
I've got, I've got nothing left.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.952
-Come on. They're going to kill you.
-Ah, no.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.287
I'll do that myself.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.831
Once I'm done with her.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.963
Let's get out of here.

35:02.016 --> 35:03.309
Believe.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.855
Praise be.

35:09.857 --> 35:10.942
Don't worry.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.821
-Just relax.
-Judson.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.406
It will all be over before you know it.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.745
I can see something.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.082
There's people gathering,

35:27.625 --> 35:28.835
and there's fear.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.087
Fear in the room.

35:36.759 --> 35:39.095
Lommie, come to me.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.191
Sorry.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.113
I doubted...

35:58.322 --> 35:59.532
There's a woman.

36:00.741 --> 36:02.410
She's a survivor. She's...

36:03.953 --> 36:05.788
She's the leader, I can hear her.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.498
You have a strong mind,

36:08.541 --> 36:09.625
a strong will.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.879
But your real strength is in us.

36:14.046 --> 36:15.256
...in us.

36:15.756 --> 36:16.841
Believe.

36:19.093 --> 36:21.387
Let me hear you say it. Please.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.769
Believe.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.229
Good.

36:30.771 --> 36:31.814
Good.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.943
You are strong.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.531
Praise the Shooting Star.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.701
It has brought life into our world.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.453
New Givers...

36:45.536 --> 36:48.372
...and one strong Sister.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.208
Believe.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.960
I'm saddened by your resistance, Mel.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.671
Perhaps I should have added
a gene that codes...

36:55.755 --> 36:56.881
...for courage.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.092
Fuck you, you psychotic bitch.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.387
That type of thinking is poison.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.640
We purged it from our system

37:05.723 --> 37:07.725
to maintain sustainability,

37:08.684 --> 37:10.061
and we will purge it again.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.064
Tonight we take...

37:13.147 --> 37:14.565
...the head of the snake.

37:15.524 --> 37:17.568
And we will eat fresh meat!

37:17.652 --> 37:18.945
Believe!

37:19.028 --> 37:20.988
-Believe!
-Believe!

37:21.072 --> 37:22.323
Connie.

37:22.782 --> 37:23.950
Yes, Lommie?

37:30.164 --> 37:31.457
Fuck!

37:31.540 --> 37:32.375
Fuck.

37:32.458 --> 37:33.542
Thale!

37:34.961 --> 37:36.712
-You are the poison.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.382
You'll rot in hell.

37:46.681 --> 37:47.974
Oh, Thale!

37:50.184 --> 37:51.394
Mother, no!

37:51.477 --> 37:53.145
-No!
-Get them!

37:53.229 --> 37:54.355
Mother!

37:55.398 --> 37:56.691
Get them!

38:08.828 --> 38:10.413
Trap them!

38:11.247 --> 38:12.373
They're coming!

38:13.082 --> 38:14.625
They're fucking coming!

38:22.216 --> 38:23.259
No!

38:24.468 --> 38:25.636
Hurry!

38:26.637 --> 38:28.472
-Get the door!
-No!

38:29.724 --> 38:30.725
Open it!

38:30.808 --> 38:33.102
-Open it! Open it!
-Quickly! Quickly!

38:40.735 --> 38:42.570
Get ready to open the airlocks!

39:05.009 --> 39:06.427
This ain't over.

39:08.804 --> 39:11.682
The closer we get to the Volcryn,
the stranger it's going to get.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.857
Everyone was acting mad
on that ship.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.485
It's like she was possessed.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.570
I idolized that woman.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.074
Well, who you wanted her to be,

39:28.157 --> 39:29.825
not what she became.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.912
You saw her, didn't you?

39:33.996 --> 39:35.498
-Saved our lives.
-Oh, yeah.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.458
For the second time.

39:39.668 --> 39:40.836
I guess.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.089
You did.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.132
And the Crystal?

39:46.967 --> 39:48.052
Smashed, sir.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.971
Connie, most likely, years ago.

39:54.767 --> 39:55.726
They were crazy.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.815
I'll be porting.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.234
Could use a break from this world.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.839
I saved your life today.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.396
I need you to know,

40:45.901 --> 40:47.570
I will always be loyal...

40:50.781 --> 40:52.408
to the real Captain Eris.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.751
You're an L.
