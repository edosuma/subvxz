WEBVTT

00:02.128 --> 00:03.212
Looks good over here.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.300
Red. We're all set.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.053
- How many?
- Six.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.347
Four around the perimeter,
two in the catwalks.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.182
- Any obstructions?
- None.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.435
Wide angle, night vision,
motion detection.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.728
We should have what we need.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.062
We should or we do?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.606
- Red, uh--
- Check again.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.693
I told you,
there's no room for error on this.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.111
If we can't see

00:27.111 --> 00:29.989
or, worse, Harold or anyone
clocks a camera...

00:29.989 --> 00:31.073
That won't happen.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.243
We're talking about an eighth of an inch,
but we'll triple check.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.831
But I'm telling you, we're good.

00:39.582 --> 00:41.459
Find some wood and knock on it.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.480
Mr. Chang.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.024
Whether you realize it or not,

01:05.024 --> 01:08.319
you are currently attending what I like
to call a Come To Jesus meeting.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.155
You have a choice to make,

01:11.155 --> 01:12.740
and what you do next

01:12.740 --> 01:14.575
will either be your salvation...

01:16.786 --> 01:17.995
or your ruin.

01:19.455 --> 01:22.625
We sent the mobile command module
we recovered from your safe house

01:22.625 --> 01:24.376
to the NSA for examination.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.503
And guess what.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.589
They say the program you stole
wasn't on the system.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.466
- No?
- No.

01:31.175 --> 01:34.887
Apparently, it had already been stripped
and uploaded to an unknown location.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.972
- I see.
- No.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.141
Tsk. I don't think you do, Mr. Chang.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.393
That's why I asked Director Cooper

01:41.393 --> 01:44.021
to bring you to my office,
so I could enlighten you.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.652
The HexRoot program is a national asset,

01:49.652 --> 01:52.029
the result of thousands
of hours of development

01:52.029 --> 01:54.114
and more time and money
than our government

01:54.114 --> 01:55.741
will ever formally acknowledge.

01:56.826 --> 01:58.410
Losing it is not an option.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.622
But as you just said, it's already lost.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.750
Misplaced. Temporarily.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.294
Because you are going to return it

02:07.294 --> 02:10.089
and help us catch Wujing
and everyone else involved.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.132
Or?

02:12.132 --> 02:15.928
Or you will discover what it feels like

02:15.928 --> 02:18.389
to have the full weight
of the American government

02:18.389 --> 02:23.269
come bearing down on one tiny troll.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.439
Two hours.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.567
- Understood.
- Not a minute more.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.653
If he hasn't cooperated by then,
I'm authorizing his transport

02:32.653 --> 02:36.407
to a CIA black site
for more advanced interrogation.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.244
On your feet.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.216
Are we really doing this?

02:54.800 --> 02:57.553
I guess so. They're coming out the door.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.645
Take him back to Interrogation.
The senator set a two-hour clock.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.565
If he hasn't cooperated by then,
he's leaving the country.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.817
She's turning him
over to the Agency?

03:11.817 --> 03:13.152
That's entirely up to him.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.680
Are those necessary?
You already blacked out the windows.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.765
What am I gonna see?

03:42.765 --> 03:46.310
You don't have to put them on.
If you prefer, I can do it for you.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.113
Tow agents, one guest.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.323
Check.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.178
Ten minutes out.
We're initiating the Access Protocol.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.972
- You got our instructions?
- Yes, sir.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.224
We need to be sure that
this van isn't followed.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.310
Understood. We're taking additional
diversionary measures.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.022
Wujing won't stop. You know that, right?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.440
You can take all the measures you want.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.651
Eventually, he <i>will</i> figure out
where you are.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.911
Bo Chang. Previously admitted,

04:45.911 --> 04:47.997
returning from Senator Panabaker's office.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.314
Stand on the line.

05:14.982 --> 05:15.983
Hold still.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.030
Right hand.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.593
- Are we clear?
- Prints are still running.

05:42.593 --> 05:43.927
This is ridiculous.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.971
It's me. I was just here an hour ago.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.269
Chang comma Bo.
A.K.A. Farmer comma Troll.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.979
<i>Now</i> you're clear.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.142
And there he is.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.937
Clock's ticking, Reddington!

06:36.438 --> 06:37.981
I'm talking to a dead man.

06:38.941 --> 06:39.983
So dramatic.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.194
It's sad.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.572
For all your talent,
you never did have any judgment.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.866
Come on. Wujing?

06:49.159 --> 06:51.787
You're finally out of prison,
it's a new day,

06:51.787 --> 06:55.499
and you choose to align yourself
with a washed-up assassin

06:55.499 --> 06:57.292
who's spreading rumors

06:57.292 --> 07:00.087
about things he couldn't
possibly understand.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.964
He understands enough.

07:01.964 --> 07:05.467
You of all people know
that what you <i>think</i> you see

07:05.467 --> 07:07.469
is rarely the full picture.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.472
I hope you're hearing me, Chang.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.933
Because if you want to live through this,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.269
you'll tell these agents
what they want to know.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.646
Let's go.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.659
It's not just Reddington.

07:31.577 --> 07:32.744
They know <i>your</i> names.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.415
Ressler, Zuma, Malik, Cooper.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.958
Time's up at 2:30.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.252
You have an hour and 27 minutes left.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.004
Not just your names. Y-Your faces.

07:42.004 --> 07:45.465
All right. We get it, Chang.
We believe you. You're a real tough guy.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.969
We'll be back in five minutes
to get your statement.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.775
We're wasting time.
You have less than an hour.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.068
Where is Wujing?

08:08.363 --> 08:11.491
You know, the HexRoot program
doesn't officially exist,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.036
so how did Wujing know
it was leaving the Pentagon?

08:14.953 --> 08:16.163
What does he want it for?

08:17.289 --> 08:18.916
Answer the question!

08:18.916 --> 08:20.083
What do you think?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.336
It's priceless.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.547
So he intends to sell it.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.091
Of course. Every enemy this country has,

08:28.091 --> 08:30.302
and half of its friends
would pay a fortune

08:30.302 --> 08:31.845
for a copy of that software.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.889
No, it's not about the money, is it?

08:33.889 --> 08:36.767
Come on, man.
Everything's about the money.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.393
It's just not the man's top priority.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.437
He wants to take down Reddington.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.855
Wrong.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.150
We don't want to take down Reddington.
We want to expose the truth.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.945
The <i>truth</i> will take down Reddington.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.279
So why did he come to you?

08:50.572 --> 08:52.407
Because I was on Marvin Gerard's list.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.619
And because Wujing knows
that I have the skill set

08:55.619 --> 08:57.162
to use it to hack your system.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.665
Looking for what exactly?

08:59.665 --> 09:02.000
All of it. Every case file.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.878
Every Main Justice directive.
His immunity agreement.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.839
Everything that proves
Reddington's connection

09:07.839 --> 09:09.049
to the FBI.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.884
Yeah, but our archives are secure.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.137
Your archives are offline.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.597
Doesn't mean they're secure.

09:15.597 --> 09:19.017
Well, it means that you can't access them
outside of this building.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.728
Why? What's he gonna do?
Attack a federal facility?

09:22.813 --> 09:23.814
Who knows?

09:34.366 --> 09:36.118
Any luck?
Mm-mm.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.329
Panabaker scares him,
but Wujing terrifies him.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.414
Well,

09:40.414 --> 09:42.124
- he's not gonna like the CIA.
- Hmm.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.877
Well, Reddington said
he wasn't gonna talk.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.212
I hate it when he's right.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.839
Stick to it.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.174
The Agency's sending a team
over to pick him up.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.765
That was about your Agency escort.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.309
Transport team's on its way.

10:18.702 --> 10:22.122
So, Wujing,
how much does he know about this place?

10:24.207 --> 10:25.250
Your time's up.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.420
My time?

10:28.420 --> 10:31.340
See, I don't get it, Chang.
I mean, why not cooperate?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.884
You can't help Wujing now.
Why not try to help yourself?

10:33.884 --> 10:36.011
Because I'm not buying
what the government's selling.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.388
Any way you slice it, I'm going to prison

10:38.388 --> 10:40.140
for a long time, and on the inside,

10:40.140 --> 10:43.060
I need friends, not enemies
with a long reach like Wujing.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.770
You really think a guy like Wujing

10:44.770 --> 10:46.855
is gonna appreciate your loyalty?

10:47.689 --> 10:48.732
We'll see.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.610
To be honest,
I'm less interested in helping him

10:51.610 --> 10:53.236
than I am in hurting Reddington.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.532
Well... Safe travels, Chang.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.409
You're the CIA's problem now.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.464
No dice. Still talking tough.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.342
Seems like he knows something
that we don't.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.246
What happened?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.039
I don't know.
He must've gotten out somehow.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.332
What do you mean? I was just with him.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.876
His hands were cuffed,
and the door was locked.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.586
- Well, he's out and on the move.
- Where?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.212
I would think looking for an exit.

12:34.212 --> 12:37.132
All right. Code red.
We got a runner at large in the building.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.426
Bo Chang. He's on foot.
Last seen in Box One.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.219
He probably took the east corridor.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.013
Initiate a full lockdown.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.227
- Dembe, what's going on?
- Chang is making a run for it.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.652
Hey.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.697
- Who's got eyes?
- Cameras are coming up now.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.826
There he is. He's found the east corridor.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.244
All right. We're on it.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.501
He's almost out.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.753
<i>We're approaching
the ground floor.</i>

14:06.888 --> 14:08.974
- He's gone.
- What do you think?

14:11.268 --> 14:12.519
I think it worked.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.002
Well, shut my mouth and call me Shirley.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.336
It's incredible, isn't it?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.548
Astounding!

14:44.092 --> 14:46.011
I'd say I'd never seen anything like it,

14:46.011 --> 14:47.721
but that certainly isn't the case.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.308
What... How? Harold, what am I looking at?

14:51.308 --> 14:53.768
Believe me, I had the same question.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.856
Reddington brought me here
for the first time a few days ago,

14:57.856 --> 14:59.941
right after the Troll Farmer was arrested.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.196
Harold, you look flummoxed.

15:07.616 --> 15:08.742
What on earth?

15:09.367 --> 15:11.995
I see.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.914
All things considered,
I'll take that as a compliment.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.792
It has been quite an undertaking.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.794
You said you had something big to tell us.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.421
Yes, well...

15:21.421 --> 15:23.381
the "something big" is a building.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.842
Our building. The Post Office.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.136
I don't understand. When did you do this?

15:28.136 --> 15:29.471
<i>How</i> did you do this?

15:29.471 --> 15:32.349
I started the same day
you and the Task Force

15:32.349 --> 15:33.516
returned to work,

15:33.516 --> 15:36.061
the day Jennifer Moores died.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.188
The day of the explosion
at the Chinese Consulate?

15:38.188 --> 15:39.397
Yes.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.358
Wujing was asking questions

15:41.358 --> 15:44.277
about my connection to the FBI.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.947
It wasn't difficult
to reason that Marvin Gerard

15:47.947 --> 15:50.450
must have told him
about the work we've been doing.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.327
You knew Wujing would be
looking for proof.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.788
Proof that could only be found
at the Post Office.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.375
I started searching
for a suitable space right away.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.461
Mr. Reddington, this place
checks a lot of your boxes.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.048
Thirty thousand square feet,
no windows, high ceilings.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.800
I don't need high ceilings, Andrea.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.470
I need at least two stories,
not just a mezzanine.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.223
They do fully catered events,
which means it has a working kitchen.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.849
I know you didn't request that--

16:14.849 --> 16:16.101
You're right. I didn't.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.061
A kitchen is nice, but I don't need it.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.438
And this has been open to the public.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.358
The place I need has to be discreet.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.486
I need it to be invisible.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.737
That doesn't exist.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.448
A vacant space that large in this area?

16:30.448 --> 16:33.576
Remember, I can only show you
what's available.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.412
So it does exist.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.415
It's just being used by somebody else.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.875
Are you saying you want to
buy someone out?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.669
How about I buy you lunch

16:42.669 --> 16:45.213
and you tell me everything you know

16:45.213 --> 16:48.341
about the companies that
have factories in the area?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.301
Wujing was looking for the Post Office,

16:50.301 --> 16:52.137
so you decided to build a duplicate?

16:52.137 --> 16:55.598
Duplicate. Decoy. Dummy.

16:55.598 --> 16:59.686
Interesting that
all those words start with "D."

16:59.686 --> 17:00.937
I'm catching up.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.357
Wujing knows what
the Post Office looks like.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.735
There are Blacklisters on Marvin's list

17:06.735 --> 17:08.570
who were held there.
Some were interrogated there.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.448
Thank goodness
for all your protocols, Harold.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.409
All those blindfolds and blackout vans.

17:14.409 --> 17:18.079
Wujing knows what he's looking for
and how it looks,

17:18.079 --> 17:19.789
just not where to find it.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.833
It's uncanny! If I didn't know better,

17:21.833 --> 17:25.003
I'd think I was standing
in the actual building.

17:25.003 --> 17:28.006
Reddington's had construction crews
working around the clock.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.174
And all of this works?

17:29.924 --> 17:32.093
The overheads, the terminals?

17:32.093 --> 17:34.220
The workstations all have power?

17:34.220 --> 17:36.347
- Remarkable.
- All for an illusion?

17:36.347 --> 17:40.727
Yes. All for an illusion
that isn't an illusion.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.897
It's not a movie set.
There are no Styrofoam walls.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.358
It's an exact reproduction
of the original.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.571
So Reddington didn't build
a <i>fake</i> Post Office.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.449
He built <i>another</i> Post Office?

17:55.033 --> 17:56.284
Down to the last detail.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.829
Okay, Harold.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.456
I'm up to speed on the what.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.043
You're gonna have to help me with the <i>why.</i>

18:06.419 --> 18:08.505
There's a reason I brought Chang
to your office this morning.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.632
And it wasn't just so I could
read him the riot act?

18:10.632 --> 18:11.716
No.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.219
We had to get him out
of the real Post Office

18:14.219 --> 18:17.847
so that after the meeting,
we could bring him back <i>here.</i>

18:18.973 --> 18:21.184
You want to let Chang escape?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.478
Yes. Uh, from this building.

18:23.478 --> 18:27.607
The <i>duplicate</i> Post Office,
to allow him to set the trap.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.236
If Chang escapes,
he'll immediately go back to Wujing

18:31.236 --> 18:34.030
and tell him where he was being held.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.323
And when he does,

18:35.323 --> 18:38.827
Wujing will not be able
to resist the urge to act.

18:39.327 --> 18:43.164
He'll gather his troops
and come charging in here,

18:43.164 --> 18:45.416
and you and the Task Force
will be waiting.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.293
That could work.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.962
It <i>will</i> work, Harold.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.297
One move.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.174
One stealth move.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.678
Nobody will see it coming.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.180
So Chang believes he escaped?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.723
How'd you manage that?

19:00.723 --> 19:02.517
It wasn't that hard, actually.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.019
All we had to do was
manufacture an opportunity,

19:05.019 --> 19:08.439
and once Chang jumped at it,
the rest was easy.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.405
Look at that.
He used the paperclip to short the panel.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.283
He's trying to reset
and recode the sequence.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.702
Even for him, that's a long shot.

19:20.702 --> 19:21.911
I agree.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.913
We should give him some help.

19:34.257 --> 19:38.011
<i>From there, it was just a matter
of letting Chang stay one step ahead.</i>

19:38.011 --> 19:41.014
We knew that he was in the stairwell,
headed for the east exit door.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.141
The fire extinguisher
was Reddington's idea

19:43.141 --> 19:45.310
so it wouldn't seem too easy.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.188
<i>We got there in time to stop him,</i>

19:49.188 --> 19:51.649
but we waited until he was in the clear.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.693
We're approaching the ground floor.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.778
<i>He's almost out.</i>

19:55.778 --> 19:57.488
A few more seconds.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.163
<i>It worked beautifully.</i>

20:05.163 --> 20:07.624
We gave him just enough time to get away.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.417
So what now?

20:10.001 --> 20:11.628
Now we see if Reddington is right.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.047
If he is, Chang went back to Wujing

20:14.047 --> 20:16.424
and is telling him exactly where we are.

20:25.767 --> 20:26.809
Wujing.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.354
Apologies for the interruption...

20:29.354 --> 20:30.438
but this couldn't wait.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.734
I was told you were arrested.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.277
I escaped.

20:37.362 --> 20:38.613
The pickup was secure.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.531
He's clean.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.450
He's not wearing a wire.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.207
You were right.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.584
I saw Reddington with my own eyes.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.795
Inside the FBI's facility.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.381
Wujing, I know where it is.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.967
I can take you there.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.473
Harold, if Reddington's right,

21:05.473 --> 21:08.351
Wujing is gonna attack this place
with everything he has.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.520
Yes. He'll want to strike quickly,

21:10.520 --> 21:13.314
before we've had the opportunity
to fortify our defenses.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.817
Most likely at night.
And time is money.

21:15.817 --> 21:19.070
This war is costing him a fortune,
a fortune he doesn't have.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.864
So this is going to happen
in the very near future.

21:22.740 --> 21:23.741
I'm betting on it.

21:24.659 --> 21:25.868
And when it does...

21:27.537 --> 21:28.621
we'll be ready.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.797
There are satellite images
of the address Chang provided.

21:39.674 --> 21:40.675
This is the main building?

21:41.718 --> 21:42.760
Were any blueprints available?

21:42.760 --> 21:46.055
No. But we had Chang
prepare a layout of the interior.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.603
So, we are limited by what he can recall?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.231
Yes, but...

21:55.231 --> 21:58.568
what we see does match
with what we know.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.698
The entire complex is
nearly 40,000 square feet.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.158
Well hidden from the street.

22:05.158 --> 22:08.369
Now, I sent a team to scout the location.

22:08.369 --> 22:11.205
There are no entrances
accessible to the public.

22:11.205 --> 22:12.331
Hmm.

22:13.374 --> 22:16.085
The primary workspace is subterranean?

22:16.085 --> 22:17.837
Yes, with a second level

22:17.837 --> 22:21.132
that includes office space
and several catwalks.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.596
Harold Cooper's office.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.891
Possibly. That's consistent
with the intel we have.

22:29.891 --> 22:31.601
How many guards are there?

22:32.018 --> 22:34.937
I don't know.
They put me in an interrogation room.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.022
But a lot.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.483
We also have a lot.

22:39.942 --> 22:40.943
We're going in?

22:40.943 --> 22:44.989
With enough mercenary power
to neutralize any resistance.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.367
The new leader of Henrik Fisker's group,
what is his name?

22:48.367 --> 22:51.412
- Sven Hollufson.
- Hollufson. Yes.

22:51.412 --> 22:52.538
Call him...

22:52.538 --> 22:53.956
Tell him we finally know

22:53.956 --> 22:56.167
where to find the proof
we have been seeking.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.252
<i>Let's be clear.</i>

22:58.252 --> 23:00.797
If Wujing attacks,
he's intentionally assaulting

23:00.797 --> 23:03.591
what he knows to be
a heavily guarded federal facility.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.885
To succeed, we need to be clever.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.137
After Chang's escape,
the FBI knows

23:08.137 --> 23:10.098
their location has been compromised.

23:10.098 --> 23:13.768
So they may be expecting an attack?

23:13.768 --> 23:15.311
We should assume so.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.482
Then we can't enter from the same point
that Chang used to get out.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.442
The FBI knows that spot is vulnerable.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.569
I guarantee they're shoring it up
as we speak.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.821
<i>Chang knows how he got out.</i>

23:24.821 --> 23:27.740
What are the chances Wujing
tries to get in the same way?

23:27.740 --> 23:28.825
Well, it's possible.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.910
He may not trust that exact entry point,

23:30.910 --> 23:32.870
but the most likely approach is definitely

23:32.870 --> 23:34.831
one of the stairwells
along the lower perimeter.

23:34.831 --> 23:38.126
We are not gonna be using
any of the exterior access points

23:38.126 --> 23:39.627
along the lower perimeter.

23:40.503 --> 23:41.963
We're not?
No.

23:42.797 --> 23:46.676
We need to surprise them.
I have another idea.

23:46.676 --> 23:49.470
The plan is to allow Wujing's people
to enter the building,

23:49.470 --> 23:50.930
make their way to this room,

23:50.930 --> 23:52.849
then cut off any escape routes
behind them.

23:52.849 --> 23:55.184
If they come,
he'll have some serious firepower.

23:58.771 --> 23:59.939
We'll be ready.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.191
I've reassigned 20 of the SWAT officers

24:02.191 --> 24:03.943
who normally guard the Post Office.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.863
Thanks to Cynthia,
Main Justice is sending 15 more.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.781
When Wujing gets here, these officers

24:08.781 --> 24:10.783
will be positioned around this room

24:10.783 --> 24:13.661
and in the catwalks,
ready to engage and disarm them.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.497
And what if Wujing's guys
aren't down with that plan?

24:16.497 --> 24:19.709
If they resist,
they'll be overpowered and arrested.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.627
Wujing's in for quite a surprise.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.005
Instead of attacking
from the ground level,

24:24.005 --> 24:26.716
our operatives will come from top down.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.136
<i>Our access point will be
the neighboring building</i>

24:30.136 --> 24:31.679
<i>immediately to the west.</i>

24:42.064 --> 24:44.483
<i>Once there, we will move to the roof.</i>

24:45.776 --> 24:49.197
<i>From there, we will cross to the roof
of the target building.</i>

24:55.745 --> 24:59.040
<i>Mr. Chang will handle matters from there.</i>

24:59.040 --> 25:01.918
<i>The program we stole
from the NSA has...</i>

25:02.543 --> 25:05.546
Well, let's just call it
a masking component.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.631
It's complicated, but bottom line,

25:06.631 --> 25:08.674
it can be used to conceal an intrusion.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.636
So you can get us
into the building undetected?

25:11.636 --> 25:12.720
Yes.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.433
<i>But don't get me wrong,
the building's defenses are robust,</i>

25:17.433 --> 25:19.268
<i>so they won't be fooled forever.</i>

25:21.604 --> 25:23.397
<i>When I disable the alarming systems,</i>

25:23.397 --> 25:26.025
<i>they will adapt and alert to the attack.</i>

25:26.025 --> 25:28.277
<i>But by the time
the intrusion is detected</i>

25:28.277 --> 25:29.570
and the FBI reacts,

25:30.529 --> 25:33.199
we will already be inside.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.335
All checkpoints, report.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.754
<i>Standing by.</i>

25:50.299 --> 25:51.884
Nothing here.

25:52.718 --> 25:53.970
No sign of Wujing.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.518
This is Team Leader One.
We're in position.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.354
All clear.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.648
The masking program is working.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.734
They don't realize the elevator
has been commandeered?

26:49.734 --> 26:52.611
No. The system hasn't detected
the intrusion. But it will.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.530
How long do we have?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.490
Long enough.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.951
This elevator will take us
to the primary workspace,

26:58.951 --> 27:00.953
the underground War Room.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.122
Even if their system discovers the error,

27:03.122 --> 27:05.916
they won't have time to react
before we strike.

27:07.877 --> 27:08.961
Weapons ready!

27:25.478 --> 27:26.520
We're almost there.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.148
Mr. Hollufson...

27:30.941 --> 27:33.277
I don't care what it takes or who we kill.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.323
I want control of this facility.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.954
How confident are you?

27:43.954 --> 27:45.122
About the attack?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.084
An hour ago, I would have said very.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.668
Now I don't know.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.253
We've got solid systems in place,

27:51.253 --> 27:53.214
and there's nothing on the radar.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.132
The lower perimeter's clear.

27:55.132 --> 27:58.511
Maybe Raymond overestimated
how quickly Wujing would react.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.221
What, you think he's not coming?

28:00.221 --> 28:01.764
Ah, he's a careful man.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.766
<i>Maybe he wants more time to prepare.</i>

28:04.809 --> 28:05.976
Seconds away.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.319
Here we are.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.448
Whoa! Fellas! It's just me.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.076
Upper floors are clear.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.508
I don't understand. Where is everyone?

28:38.968 --> 28:40.928
Wherever they are, they'll be back,

28:40.928 --> 28:42.471
so let's just do
what we came here to do

28:42.471 --> 28:44.348
and not be here when they return.

28:45.266 --> 28:46.308
Get to work.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.187
It'll take a few minutes for HexRoot
to override their defenses.

28:50.187 --> 28:53.607
Once I'm in, I can upload
their archive to our server.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.734
Watch the entrances. Stay alert.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.216
No! No!

29:20.718 --> 29:23.679
Easy, gentlemen. Easy. Everybody, relax.

29:24.763 --> 29:25.931
Drop your weapon.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.768
Now, Sven...
Uh, may I call you Sven?

29:30.644 --> 29:32.563
Sven, what's done is done.

29:32.563 --> 29:35.024
You have guns, we have guns.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.653
He's dead. Kill them!

29:39.653 --> 29:41.322
Hold! This is my operation now.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.866
- Nobody fires!
- Well-reasoned.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.701
I was counting on the prospect

29:45.701 --> 29:47.495
that cooler heads would prevail.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.330
You're not walking out of here.

29:49.914 --> 29:50.915
Count on that.

29:50.915 --> 29:54.376
Well, the truth is, we should <i>all</i> be
leaving here fairly shortly.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.378
How are we on time?

29:58.088 --> 29:59.673
The Bureau's still in position.

29:59.673 --> 30:00.966
Nobody's left the building.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.844
Good news.
It seems we have a moment to chat.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.138
The "Bureau." So it's all true.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.973
You <i>do</i> work with the FBI.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.058
Of course.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.852
So you admit that you're an informant?

30:11.852 --> 30:13.354
An informant?

30:13.354 --> 30:16.106
Sven. I'm Raymond Reddington.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.609
I run the most intricate and lucrative

30:18.609 --> 30:21.320
criminal operation in existence.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.365
A global enterprise
that you and Wujing have,

30:24.365 --> 30:25.783
or had,

30:25.783 --> 30:28.285
neither the knowledge nor the experience

30:28.285 --> 30:30.579
to even remotely comprehend.

30:30.579 --> 30:33.832
I'm at the apex of the criminal pyramid,

30:33.832 --> 30:37.878
an increasingly competitive
and brutal world,

30:37.878 --> 30:40.089
where those that are under

30:40.089 --> 30:44.677
are constantly scheming
and striving to get on top,

30:44.677 --> 30:46.095
and yet, here I am.

30:46.095 --> 30:48.514
I'm still here at the tippy top.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.058
And thriving. Always have.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.352
Why do you think that is, Sven?

30:54.562 --> 30:55.563
Uh, that's unfair.

30:55.563 --> 30:58.274
I make it sound
as if there's only one reason,

30:58.274 --> 31:00.234
and in truth, there are many,

31:00.234 --> 31:02.236
but one of the most important

31:02.236 --> 31:06.282
has always been my relationship
with law enforcement.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.866
You feed them information.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.618
I trade intelligence.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.037
The lifeblood of any covert operation.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.455
You know this.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.792
Success is a function
of access and information.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.712
The world's elite criminals have always

31:19.712 --> 31:22.673
cultivated relationships
with law enforcement.

31:22.673 --> 31:25.426
I'm no different,
except that I do it better,

31:25.426 --> 31:28.470
with a little thought
and a little imagination

31:28.470 --> 31:30.431
and the visionary purpose

31:30.431 --> 31:32.683
that's made me who and what I am.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.852
A lot of people,
including some of our own,

31:34.852 --> 31:36.812
have gone to prison because of you.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.190
We're having a philosophical conversation,

31:40.190 --> 31:41.525
an exchange of ideas,

31:41.525 --> 31:44.486
so I'm gonna try to contain
my disappointment.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.904
Tell me I'm wrong.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.492
"There's no honor among thieves."

31:50.492 --> 31:51.994
You know that saying?

31:51.994 --> 31:54.413
I despise that saying

31:54.413 --> 31:57.791
because the fact is, in this life of ours,

31:57.791 --> 32:01.795
there are lines
that even criminals should not cross,

32:01.795 --> 32:04.882
a standard of conduct even for those

32:04.882 --> 32:08.135
who earn their livelihood
by breaking the law.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.888
Do I use my leverage with law enforcement

32:10.888 --> 32:14.016
to hold those who violate
that standard accountable?

32:14.016 --> 32:15.726
Yes, I do.

32:15.726 --> 32:19.980
Those individuals have forfeited the right
to operate freely,

32:19.980 --> 32:22.775
and every single one of them

32:22.775 --> 32:25.527
is lucky they are held to account
by others

32:25.527 --> 32:28.322
instead of being held to account by me.

32:31.283 --> 32:35.037
Sven, my associates make money.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.789
A lot of it.

32:36.789 --> 32:41.377
My rising tide has been lifting
all boats for decades,

32:41.377 --> 32:43.921
and as long as that is the fact,

32:43.921 --> 32:48.092
how I do what I do,
who I leverage and why

32:48.092 --> 32:50.219
is nobody's business but my own.

32:51.804 --> 32:54.223
You're wondering why
I'm telling you this.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.267
And what happens now?

32:58.143 --> 33:01.188
Well, perhaps the why
will answer the what.

33:01.188 --> 33:04.566
You men are mercenaries. Hired hands.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.778
This was never your fight.
Were you paid in full?

33:07.778 --> 33:10.114
Because now your employer is dead,

33:10.114 --> 33:12.366
and you're available for hire once again.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.494
- You're not serious.
- Quiet.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.417
So what are you suggesting?

33:21.417 --> 33:24.002
I'm offering. You need work.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.422
- I have work.
- Enough!

33:26.880 --> 33:29.883
You can live
to fight another battle, another day,

33:29.883 --> 33:33.220
and when that battle comes,
you can fight it with me.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.472
Mr. Reddington, we've got movement.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.100
Time's up.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.227
Sven, in or out?

33:41.729 --> 33:43.897
In.
Good.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.734
Then there's only one matter
left to resolve,

33:46.734 --> 33:48.652
what to do with you, Zhang Wei.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.280
You were never just a hired hand.

33:52.322 --> 33:54.742
You were Wujing's closest confederate,

33:54.742 --> 33:56.827
killer, confidant.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.747
Innocent people died because of you.

34:00.831 --> 34:03.542
Generally, I prefer
to do these things myself,

34:03.542 --> 34:07.504
but I only have 13 rounds
left in my Browning.

34:07.504 --> 34:09.590
I hate to waste even one of them

34:09.590 --> 34:11.550
on a piece of trash like you.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.428
And as it happens, I just hired an army.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.266
Imagine, you dying at the hands

34:19.266 --> 34:22.227
of the very man
you hired to eliminate me.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.771
It's just... Ah, the hell with it.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.074
How are we?

34:36.950 --> 34:37.993
All clear.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.343
There's no rigor mortis.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.887
They've been dead
for less than two hours.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.264
Facility's clear.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.558
No other bodies
and no signs of Reddington.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.769
Looks like both have
single gunshot wounds,

35:03.769 --> 35:05.354
but ME's coming down.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.400
We won't get any help from the cameras.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.362
The security history
from the last six hours has been wiped.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.947
No records found.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.573
There were hardly any guards left behind.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.450
Most of them were with us
when this happened.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.786
When what happened, exactly?
I don't know.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.996
Reddington must have done this, but...

35:22.996 --> 35:26.041
I'm sorry.
Reddington not only murdered two men,

35:26.041 --> 35:28.085
but he did it in our War Room.

35:28.085 --> 35:29.837
Is that really what we're saying?

35:29.837 --> 35:31.338
No cameras.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.132
No logs left behind
showing anyone going in or out.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.551
So we're blind on this?

35:40.931 --> 35:42.266
It's him.

35:49.731 --> 35:50.899
Harold.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.527
Answer it.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.161
<i>Say something, Harold.</i>

36:08.375 --> 36:11.420
I understand. And I'm sorry.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.963
But I do think it was best

36:12.963 --> 36:17.467
for you and the others
to be nowhere nearby

36:17.467 --> 36:20.220
when things reached
their inevitable conclusion.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.222
I mean, all of this?
Just so you could kill him?

36:22.222 --> 36:24.474
<i>No, Donald. Not "just."</i>

36:24.474 --> 36:27.185
Wujing's misguided crusade

36:27.185 --> 36:30.314
simply put a spotlight
on a much larger problem.

36:31.315 --> 36:34.401
The Post Office has
always been a liability.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.195
<i>I've known as much
for some time, of course.</i>

36:38.238 --> 36:42.701
I tried to accept,
or at the very least, ignore it.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.036
<i>That, too, had to end.</i>

36:44.036 --> 36:45.871
So you turned the Troll Farmer?

36:46.580 --> 36:47.873
No. I found him first.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.334
Because you knew he was on Marvin's list,

36:50.334 --> 36:53.128
and Wujing needed him
to access our archives.

36:53.128 --> 36:56.340
You know this, Dembe.
What wins wars?

36:58.550 --> 36:59.927
Anticipation.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.762
Mm.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.764
Are you sure you won't have something?

37:03.764 --> 37:05.515
It doesn't have to be tea.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.684
Have one of those sodas you like,

37:07.684 --> 37:09.770
the flavored ones. You know, uh...

37:09.770 --> 37:10.854
I'm good.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.066
I'm actually not drinking
those anymore. I have...

37:14.066 --> 37:17.027
You don't need to know this,
but I have adult onset diabetes.

37:18.278 --> 37:21.239
I don't know why I'm telling you that.
I'm just nervous.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.368
A Mello Yello!

37:25.160 --> 37:27.037
- Yeah. Good memory.
- Mm.

37:28.205 --> 37:30.540
I'm sorry to hear about the diabetes.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.086
Getting older is a drag.

37:34.962 --> 37:37.339
And you don't need to be nervous.

37:37.339 --> 37:40.008
If I meant you any harm,
you'd know by now.

37:41.343 --> 37:42.594
How'd you find me?

37:43.095 --> 37:44.262
It took some doing,

37:44.930 --> 37:48.850
but most things are possible
with the proper motivation.

37:50.644 --> 37:53.897
I didn't think you'd want to do business,
you know, after I went to prison.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.943
Right. Well, we should talk about that.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.279
You may not love everything you hear,

38:01.279 --> 38:04.324
but I'm hopeful that
when all is said and done,

38:04.324 --> 38:07.786
we can find a way to forgive and forget.

38:07.786 --> 38:08.870
Forget what?

38:11.415 --> 38:14.793
There's a man
who calls himself Wujing.

38:16.044 --> 38:19.256
Long story short,
he's an enemy of mine,

38:19.256 --> 38:21.258
and he's looking for new friends,

38:21.258 --> 38:23.218
friends to help him move against me.

38:24.261 --> 38:25.262
Never heard of him.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.222
That's not surprising.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.057
But he has heard of you.

38:29.057 --> 38:32.894
I believe your name
was on a list he was given.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.021
A list?

38:34.021 --> 38:38.108
Of criminals who might be sympathetic
to his cause.

38:38.984 --> 38:42.154
Wujing is looking for you, Chang,

38:42.154 --> 38:44.406
and when he finds you,

38:44.406 --> 38:46.450
I want you to agree to help him.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.994
You want me to help him come after you?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.162
No.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.665
But I want you to agree to help him.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.252
<i>So this was all a setup.</i>

38:57.252 --> 39:00.380
Taking Chang to the duplicate Post Office,

39:00.380 --> 39:02.049
<i>convincing us to let him "escape"</i>

39:02.049 --> 39:04.217
<i>so he would give Wujing that location.</i>

39:04.217 --> 39:06.219
You <i>wanted</i> us to think he escaped.

39:06.219 --> 39:08.722
Wanted Wujing to believe it.
You played us both.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.974
But Chang didn't give the address

39:10.974 --> 39:12.851
of the duplicate building to Wujing.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.312
He gave him the real Post Office.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.189
I saw Reddington with my own eyes,

39:17.189 --> 39:19.483
inside the FBI's facility.

39:19.483 --> 39:21.777
Wujing, I know where it is.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.446
I can take you there.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.323
And Wujing attacked
the real building,

39:26.323 --> 39:27.866
and you were waiting there for him.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.118
You didn't build that duplicate
Post Office to fool Wujing.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.411
You built it to fool <i>us!</i>

39:31.411 --> 39:33.038
To protect you, Harold.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.373
To insulate you and the Task Force

39:35.373 --> 39:37.751
from what I intended to do.

39:37.751 --> 39:40.837
<i>Now you can honestly say
you were not involved.</i>

39:40.837 --> 39:43.048
What? So we should be, what, grateful?

39:43.048 --> 39:45.050
You can be whatever
you'd like to be, Donald.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.301
<i>Something's missing.</i>

39:46.301 --> 39:48.678
You wanted to confront Wujing,
I understand that.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.097
But why here?

39:50.097 --> 39:52.682
As I said, to solve the larger problem.

39:52.682 --> 39:53.934
I needed Chang,

39:53.934 --> 39:56.603
I needed the HexRoot program,

39:56.603 --> 39:59.856
and I needed access to your network.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.650
Our network?

40:03.652 --> 40:05.112
Our archives. They're offline.

40:05.112 --> 40:07.739
They can only be accessed
from inside the building.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.118
Well, I didn't just want
to access them, Harold.

40:11.118 --> 40:15.705
The HexRoot program
is much more than just a hacking tool.

40:16.206 --> 40:18.458
<i>Once the program is inside a system,</i>

40:18.458 --> 40:21.795
<i>its secondary reason for being kicks in.</i>

40:21.795 --> 40:23.380
It deploys a virus.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.590
You deleted the archives?

40:25.590 --> 40:26.675
<i>Of course not.</i>

40:26.675 --> 40:29.678
<i>We just removed any reference to me</i>

40:29.678 --> 40:31.471
and any mention

40:31.471 --> 40:36.143
of a reliable source
or a confidential informant.

40:36.143 --> 40:38.311
You went too far this time, Raymond.

40:39.855 --> 40:41.940
- Perhaps.
- No, not perhaps!

40:41.940 --> 40:43.483
We are not just
the Reddington Task Force!

40:43.483 --> 40:45.277
We are the FBI!

40:45.277 --> 40:47.070
Main Justice will never let this stand.

40:47.070 --> 40:50.240
I don't care about Main Justice, Harold.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.993
But you and your team,
that's another matter.

40:53.660 --> 40:54.911
You're not listening.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.955
The Attorney General knows
that we can't control you,

40:56.955 --> 40:59.499
but he won't let you control <i>us,</i>
not at this level.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.168
The Attorney General has never known

41:01.168 --> 41:03.044
more than a fraction of what you do.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.963
<i>That's because I walk a very thin line.</i>

41:04.963 --> 41:07.424
I do the best I can to control
the flow of information

41:07.424 --> 41:09.968
because I believe that
our work needs to be done.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.221
<i>But redacting our archives,
leaving bodies in the War Room?</i>

41:13.221 --> 41:15.223
<i>You've put me
in an impossible position!</i>

41:15.223 --> 41:16.433
Even if I try,

41:16.433 --> 41:18.351
how long do you think
I'll be able to control <i>that?</i>

41:18.351 --> 41:19.853
I suppose we'll see.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.523
You've finally done it.

41:24.900 --> 41:25.984
Torn it all down.

41:27.194 --> 41:28.570
You're angry, Harold.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.741
Take some time to think about

41:32.741 --> 41:36.119
how or whether we can continue.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.538
I'll do the same.
