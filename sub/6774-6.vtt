00:00.301 --> 00:02.234
 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.235 --> 00:03.936
        So how did you
        become a zombie?

00:03.937 --> 00:04.737
     You clawed my forearm.

00:04.739 --> 00:05.838
      You are who you eat.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.139
      You don't just
      have their visions,

00:07.141 --> 00:09.141
   You also get some of their
   personality traits.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.609
      You're a zombie now.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.077
    For a mere 25k a month,

00:12.079 --> 00:15.314
    I've got the brains
    you need to keep
    all your pistons firing.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.749
    My roommate
    took his skateboard out,

00:16.751 --> 00:18.550
      Said he was going
      to the park
      for a couple hours.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.419
    That was four days ago.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.088
 All right, i'm gonna walk this
 over to missing persons
 right now. Nice kicks.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.624
   -Have you seen my friend?
   -Brother, i just saw him.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.092
      Blaine: <i> We'll have</i>
     <i> you to him in no time.</i>

00:27.094 --> 00:28.794
          Be my guest.

00:28.796 --> 00:29.962
     I met another zombie.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.130
           -Friendly?
           -Quite.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.731
      Who knows if we even
      like each other.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.466
 But what have we got to lose?

00:34.468 --> 00:36.101
       Hey, where did you
       get those shoes?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.103
           (grunting)

00:50.985 --> 00:52.484
            (gasps)

00:52.486 --> 00:55.087
 Easy.
 You're lucky you're not dead.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.723
   Although, if you were,
   this would come
   much more naturally to me.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.324
      You know what
      you're doing, right?

00:59.326 --> 01:01.560
  I mean, theoretically. Sure.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.729
      But did you consider
      a trip to the er?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.330
      I'm a social worker.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.833
   My insurance covers, like,
   one band-aid a year.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.135
     Major? What the hell?

01:10.137 --> 01:11.470
         It's nothing.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.142
     Those are y-incision
     stitches. They need
     to be closer together,

01:17.144 --> 01:20.145
  Unless you're going
  for that frankenstein look.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.214
  The man's too good-looking.
  I'm giving him character.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.184
   -Should i just take over?
   -Please, god, yes.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.786
      How did this happen?

01:28.355 --> 01:29.421
      He got into a fight.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.622
   I went looking for jerome.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.558
    And found the candyman.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.294
 Remember? That guy jerome said
 was handing out utopium,

01:35.296 --> 01:36.929
 Inviting kids back to his van?

01:36.931 --> 01:38.664
   He's a real person, then?
   The candyman?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.332
      He was wearing
      jerome's high tops.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.769
      How did you know
      they were jerome's?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.504
 They were cool shoes, but they
 weren't one of a kind.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.605
      They were jerome's.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.907
      So our friend here
      went full vigilante.

01:48.909 --> 01:52.377
  Batman versus the candyman.
  Point candyman.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.981
    And i assume that fight
    solved everything.

01:55.983 --> 01:59.718
    You and the candyman
    shook hands, and he
    led you right to jerome.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.320
    -He knows something.
    -(cell phone vibrating)

02:01.322 --> 02:02.821
           I know it.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.691
 You're a social worker, not a
 cop. You could've been killed.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.326
    I was an all-conference
    strong safety

02:07.328 --> 02:09.328
       For the washington
       huskies, baby.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.865
      A head-hunter.
      I'm a dangerous man.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.934
 The candyman is dangerous-er.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.536
   Please promise me
   that that's the last time

02:17.538 --> 02:19.404
      You'll take matters
      into your own hands.
      There's a reason...

02:19.406 --> 02:22.307
   Liv tell you about the guy
   she met at the wake
   the other night?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.743
    Musician type?
    If i hadn't stumbled in

02:24.745 --> 02:27.412
   And totally rocker-blocked
   this dude... Ow!

02:27.414 --> 02:28.914
      Quite an imagination
      you have there.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.049
     Have some faith in me,
     all right?

02:31.051 --> 02:33.719
    I've been girding myself
    for this day.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.889
   Come on. Who's your buddy?

02:36.891 --> 02:38.524
        I'm your buddy.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.659
    Eager to share the highs
    and lows of your life.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.594
            Mmm-hmm.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.097
  New customer! 300-pounder
  dropped dead on his stairs.
  Our services are required.

02:45.099 --> 02:47.432
    Just a second.
    I don't want it to pop.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.368
 That's fine. Chicks dig scars.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.540
       (doorbell ringing)

03:01.115 --> 03:06.151
  We've got a spinach quiche,
  freshly-baked baguette...

03:06.153 --> 03:10.088
 Spicy mustard and gulai otak.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.190
    Where's the gulai otak?

03:11.192 --> 03:12.958
       Are you sure
       it's not in there?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.493
         Yes, i'm sure!

03:14.495 --> 03:19.831
    Okay, um, i'll run back
    to meat cute and i'll be
    back in 20 minutes.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.034
     I don't think
     i can wait that long.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.282
      (theme song playing)

04:06.046 --> 04:08.413
  Whew!
  That is straight-up nasty.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.818
  I believe the professional
  term is "ugh."

04:13.887 --> 04:16.053
  Camphor?
  It'll help with the stench.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.389
           (grunts)

04:19.192 --> 04:21.059
      Ah, better. Thanks.

04:22.329 --> 04:25.330
   Our vic is simon cutler,
   32 years old.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.833
   Damn, this is the ripest
   dude i've smelled.

04:27.835 --> 04:32.037
 His skin reminds me of a grape
 that was left out in the sun
 too long and split open.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.173
 You just ruined grapes for me.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.509
     Okay, our guy here
     was a total shut-in.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.078
   No one's seen him in years,
   a regular willy wonka.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.382
  He'd receive all necessities
  through the dog hatch
  on the front door.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.118
    Apparently there was
    a pile of unopened
    deliveries spilling out,

04:46.120 --> 04:48.020
       So a neighbor
       called the police.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.355
      Uh, i'm gonna need
      more of that camphor.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.557
   So no one's been in or out?

04:53.894 --> 04:57.195
 No. Which should make figuring
 out what killed him easy.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.764
      How long do you think
      he's been here?

04:58.766 --> 05:01.667
    Well, based on the purple
    hue of the skin,

05:01.669 --> 05:04.636
     I'd say he's
     between putrefaction
     and black putrefaction.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.405
       You see how swollen
       his tongue is?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.539
   I'll take your word for it.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.874
       A week, maybe two.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.942
     By the looks
     of his computer setup,

05:10.944 --> 05:13.679
   He could've been directing
   air traffic down here.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.113
       Day trader, maybe?

05:16.817 --> 05:20.552
    Hmm. The carpet's sticky.
    Nice shag.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.455
      Apparently he's been
      down here since 1974.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.058
       Spilled his soda
       when he collapsed.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.760
   Fried chicken. Fried pies.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.996
    My money says big boy
    here had a heart attack.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.298
   Well, a heart attack
   is a reasonable hypothesis,

05:33.300 --> 05:35.067
       But seeing as he's
       in his early 30s

05:35.069 --> 05:38.203
    And hasn't been
    to the hospital recently,
    an autopsy is de rigueur.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.773
       It means required.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.875
    You know, my french tutor,
   <i> mademoiselle</i> perrier,

05:43.877 --> 05:45.911
   Is gonna be so disappointed
   i blanked on that one.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.145
            (coughs)

05:47.147 --> 05:48.647
            Confetti?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.422
         (clive reading)

05:58.926 --> 06:00.759
  Well, it was a memorable one.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.561
        (sirens wailing)

06:02.563 --> 06:06.231
   Oh. Seems the neighbors
   are curious about the man
   behind the dog hatch.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.700
     Excuse me, officer,
     what happened to him?
     Do you know?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.302
      Yeah, did he suffer?

06:10.304 --> 06:12.003
 Hey, how long was he in there?

06:13.574 --> 06:15.340
        (phone clicking)

06:15.342 --> 06:17.509
       Come on, man,
       show some respect.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.745
     What the hell is wrong
     with these people?

06:21.281 --> 06:23.515
    (ringing and vibrating)

06:26.387 --> 06:27.619
            (sighs)

06:28.355 --> 06:29.988
         Was i unclear?

06:29.990 --> 06:31.623
      Our sex life is more
      me calling you

06:31.625 --> 06:32.758
     When i'm so inclined,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.159
      And you resisting
      the urge to call me.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.694
       My delivery hasn't
       arrived yet.

06:35.696 --> 06:36.895
      It should have been
      there hours ago.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.231
        Well, it's not.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.166
   How about i bring you
   a special delivery myself?

06:43.804 --> 06:46.805
      No. I just didn't
      want to be charged.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.207
  You know what?
  I just remembered,
  that my doorbell is broken,

06:49.209 --> 06:51.443
       So he probably
       came by after all.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.478
   Anyway, i have a meeting,
   so i better boogie.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.881
     <i> I'll come by later</i>
     <i> and pick something up.</i>

06:55.883 --> 06:57.215
     Sorry to trouble you.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.483
          No worries.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.928
   Another piece of confetti
   in his eyeball.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.535
  It is sad, don't you think?
  Hermit threw himself
  a little party.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.771
    "happy birthday to me!"
    handful of confetti
    in the air.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.240
 Internal organs are liquefied.

07:22.242 --> 07:27.212
    Please say heart attack.
    I don't wanna eat, nay,
    drink rotten brains.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.682
   Arteries weren't blocked.
   No scar tissue
   around the heart.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.784
  Heart attack seems unlikely.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.487
   You know, almost anything,
   if you deep fry it...

07:37.624 --> 07:39.891
    Detective babineaux,
    what can we do for you?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.461
     I'm hoping you can
     tell me what happened
     to mr. Cutler here.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.796
     Dead 10 days.
     No cause of death yet.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.466
 I've sent his blood samples to
 that lab for bio-chem testing.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.234
       That'll give us
       more to work with.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.736
     I'm afraid
     all the decomposition
     slows us down a bit.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.638
       Well, maybe i can
       speed things up.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.842
  It turns out our friend here
  was one of the most hated
  people on the internet.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.744
 I just spent an hour
 looking through death threats
 levied against the man.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.346
     We're almost certainly
     looking at murder.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.614
        Son of a bitch!

08:04.585 --> 08:06.351
     You've grown attached
     to this one, huh?

08:06.353 --> 08:10.288
    Man's inhumanity to man.
    Do you ever
    really get used to it?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.757
     I'm pretty used to it.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.694
  Apparently, cutler here was
  an internet troll and hacker

08:15.696 --> 08:18.396
      Known hither and yon
      as the sim reaper.

08:18.398 --> 08:21.066
 There's already a website up
 celebrating this guy's demise.

08:21.068 --> 08:24.369
     Oh, let's pull it up,
     shall we?

08:24.371 --> 08:27.405
   An internet troll.
   Is that like a cyberbully?

08:27.407 --> 08:31.576
 Well, if he's an accomplished
 hacker, then he's like a
 cyberbully with super powers.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.746
     All right, sim reaper.
     Here we go.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.381
        Are all of those
        links about him?

08:37.384 --> 08:40.018
     Yup. Plus some
     of sim reaper's work.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.787
   Sexist public commentary,
   fascist political screeds,

08:42.789 --> 08:44.623
   Taking credit for shutting
   down websites,

08:44.625 --> 08:47.659
 Hacking into people's
 cloud-based accounts, sharing
 their personal content.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.227
 What kind of person does that?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.795
     Click right there
     and hear for yourself.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.031
  It's the one known recording
  of simon cutler,

08:53.033 --> 08:55.200
    A customer service call
    gone very wrong.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.337
     Woman: <i> Customer service,</i>
    <i> this is shanie.</i>

08:59.339 --> 09:01.172
        Simon: (distorted)
       <i> shanie, perfect!</i>

09:01.174 --> 09:04.042
       <i> I've been on hold</i>
       <i> for 45 minutes.</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:06.578
 Shanie: <i> I'm sorry about that,</i>
 <i> sir. Can i have your account</i>
        <i> number, please?</i>

09:06.580 --> 09:09.381
      Simon: <i> I've given it.</i>
     <i> Several times.</i>

09:09.383 --> 09:11.149
     Shanie: <i> Your name, then.</i>
    <i> I'm happy to look it up.</i>

09:11.151 --> 09:15.487
  Simon: <i> I am the</i>
  <i> sim reaper, shanie.</i>
  <i> I am the keeper of the web.</i>

09:15.489 --> 09:19.491
 <i> Ceos of fortune 500 companies</i>
 <i> tremble before me.</i>

09:19.493 --> 09:22.994
  <i> I am invisible, intangible,</i>
  <i> untouchable.</i>

09:22.996 --> 09:25.163
       <i> I am the bringer</i>
       <i> of cyber-darkness.</i>

09:25.165 --> 09:29.901
<i> Fail me, and i will delete you</i>
<i> like so much digital noise.</i>

09:29.903 --> 09:31.202
       (keyboard clicks)

09:31.204 --> 09:33.305
   Why are all the good ones
   unavailable?

09:33.307 --> 09:35.607
    I have forensics looking
    at his laptop for leads.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.509
   But if you get any psychic
   stirrings, let me know.

09:37.511 --> 09:41.813
  Don't worry, detective.
  I'm sure liv will suck it up
  and help any way she can.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.663
            (sighs)

09:58.665 --> 10:01.299
    I can't believe
    you actually drank that.

10:01.301 --> 10:06.471
  Simon cutler's rotten brains
  go down in history
  as the worst. By far.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.673
  Frankly, i'm impressed
  that they went down at all.

10:08.675 --> 10:12.344
  I have my first zombie date
  tonight. How do you think
  puking on him is gonna play?

10:12.346 --> 10:15.814
  Maybe if you ate something?
  Something else.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.916
      Like saltines maybe.
      It's worth a shot.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.155
      Hey, where did these
      donuts come from?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.758
     Oh, i brought them in
     as a peace offering
     for the early crew.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.195
 I'd offer you one, but
 you've never been a donut fan.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.564
  Liv: (thinking) <i> mmm. Donuts.</i>

10:32.566 --> 10:35.133
     <i> Great. I ate</i>
     <i> homer simpson's brain.</i>

10:43.010 --> 10:45.276
        (simon panting)

10:45.278 --> 10:46.344
            (gasps)

10:47.214 --> 10:48.279
           (wheezes)

10:56.923 --> 10:57.989
            (coughs)

10:59.026 --> 11:00.992
       Are you all right?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.762
   He was choking on a donut.
   He couldn't breathe.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.231
 I think it was a food allergy.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.366
     What, you think
     something in the donut
     caused anaphylaxis?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.301
   He barely made it up those
   stairs we found him on

11:10.303 --> 11:13.571
     And gave himself
     a shot of epinephrine.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.474
 That may be why
 he was found on those stairs.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.677
     He was trying
     to get to an epipen
     and he didn't make it.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.312
 Except i didn't find any
 trigger foods in his stomach.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.881
   No peanuts. No shellfish.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.784
 Then what the hell killed him?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.752
  Coral: Why don't you tell us
  why you're back here, joey?

11:27.754 --> 11:30.155
  I got booted from my house.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.157
             Again.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.626
     We know that. But why?

11:34.628 --> 11:36.061
      You've got the file.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.430
    If you don't share,
    that's a privilege drop,

11:38.432 --> 11:41.066
  And i don't wanna have to...

11:41.068 --> 11:43.368
      Major, what happened
      to your face?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.470
       Rollerblading.
       It's back, people.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.140
       Joey, what are you
       doing back here?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.342
    Trashed my mom's place.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.677
   Now why would you do that?

11:52.679 --> 11:54.813
     Mike was being a tool.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.383
  Joey, we've established
  that mike is always a tool.

11:58.385 --> 12:02.053
    But trashing your
    mom's place? That's you
    surrendering control.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.688
         Come on, man.

12:03.690 --> 12:07.025
  Coral:
  And that's one of the things
  joey will be working on.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.326
     (cell phone vibrating)

12:08.328 --> 12:11.396
     Finding healthy ways
     to express his anger.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.299
    No phones during group.
    Privilege drop!

12:15.902 --> 12:20.071
   You went looking for eddie
   and jerome, didn't you?

12:21.875 --> 12:25.510
 That's you surrendering
 to your messiah complex, dude.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.378
      Reality check time.

12:29.816 --> 12:30.949
         They're dead.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.987
 So you're telling me the most
 hated man on the internet

12:35.989 --> 12:37.722
     Was killed by a donut?

12:37.724 --> 12:40.992
   No. Anaphylactic shock
   killed him. But there was
   no food in his system.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.861
  In my vision, it was a donut
  that almost killed him.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.196
 No idea what triggered the
 anaphylactic shock this time.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.364
         I'm confused.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.432
        Yeah, so are we.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.302
        (siren wailing)

12:51.304 --> 12:54.439
        (heart beating)

12:54.441 --> 12:55.507
        (distorted) liv?

12:56.743 --> 12:58.843
  (in normal voice) you okay?

12:58.845 --> 13:01.346
       Yeah. Sorry, i...

13:01.348 --> 13:04.315
  ...Think maybe my breakfast
  didn't agree with me.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.021
       "happy birthday!"
       and you're dead.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.560
 If i didn't know better, i'd
 swear you're having a vision.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.466
 Hold on.
 Simon cutler's birthday is...

13:21.468 --> 13:24.435
     I just typed it
     into my police report.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.271
     His birthday isn't for
     another four months.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.306
    Who sends a card
    that far ahead of time?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.641
     And with nothing
     written on the inside?

13:29.643 --> 13:31.576
        -No stamp.
        -Hand delivered.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.311
   Maybe the card was
   a message from the killer.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.415
   -Oh, my god, the confetti.
   -The what?

13:37.417 --> 13:40.018
  The confetti.
  It was scattered on the rug.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.387
      We even dug some
      out of simon's eye.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.790
    It's a confetti flinger.
    You open the card and
    confetti shoots out.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.760
   My sorority used these
   during rush to let pledges
   know they were accepted.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.361
 "congrats, you're a mu theta."
 fwick!

13:50.897 --> 13:51.963
        Can i see that?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.638
      What does that smell
      like to you?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.342
            Peanuts.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.610
      The confetti flinger

14:05.612 --> 14:07.679
      Was a peanut powder
      delivery system.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.583
  Congratulations, detective.
  You've discovered
  the murder weapon.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.060
    Liv: <i> Assist a detective</i>
   <i> in solving a murder case.</i>

     <i> Help stave off</i>
     <i> a zombie apocalypse.</i>

14:27.400 --> 14:30.401
   <i> Yet here i am,</i>

14:30.403 --> 14:34.239
   <i> The last time i sweated</i>
   <i> an outfit choice was</i>
   <i> the night major proposed.</i>

14:34.241 --> 14:36.741
  <i> Of course,</i>
  <i> i did it the five nights</i>
  <i> leading up to the proposal,</i>

14:36.743 --> 14:39.010
       <i> Because i was sure</i>
       <i> it was coming.</i>

14:39.012 --> 14:41.512
     <i> I was sure about</i>
     <i> everything with major.</i>

14:41.514 --> 14:44.349
<i> There was no debating</i>
<i> whether or not he was the one.</i>

14:44.351 --> 14:48.219
  <i> I didn't worry i'd get bored</i>
  <i> of being with the same</i>
  <i> person year after year.</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:52.190
  <i> He was it for me.</i>
  <i> I thought i'd spend the rest</i>
  <i> of my life with major.</i>

14:52.192 --> 14:55.927
    <i> And i guess i did.</i>
    <i> But apparently my death</i>
    <i> is a new chapter.</i>

14:55.929 --> 14:58.162
    <i> Bizarre as that may be.</i>

15:05.805 --> 15:07.505
           (panting)

15:10.577 --> 15:12.010
        (heart beating)

15:20.921 --> 15:22.120
         What the hell?

15:22.122 --> 15:23.988
        (phone ringing)

15:23.990 --> 15:26.124
    Recording: <i> This is lowell,</i>
   <i> leave a message.</i>

15:26.126 --> 15:29.260
    Hey, lowell. So sorry
    to do this on a message,
    but i have to cancel.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.364
   I'm literally seconds away
   from puking. I, i...
   It hit me out of nowhere.

15:33.366 --> 15:38.169
 And i'm calling you from
 the bathroom floor right now.
 I hope you understand...

15:38.171 --> 15:42.173
 Oh, my god. I'm such an idiot.
 I totally forgot you're
 a zombie. I can just tell you.

15:42.175 --> 15:45.643
   I had a bad batch of
   agoraphobe brain and can't
   get out of my apartment.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.378
           Okay. Bye.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.351
        Dr. Chakrabarti.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.854
   Wanted to share intel
   on that near decapitation.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.958
     They said he was found
     by some hikers out
     on cold creek trail.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.260
    But the body was covered
    in bear saliva,

16:02.262 --> 16:04.529
 So i'm guessing the bear got
 to him before the hikers did.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.497
  Could a bear have done this?

16:06.499 --> 16:09.801
 Well, the bear was responsible
 for the scratching and gnawing
      part, all postmortem.

16:09.803 --> 16:13.204
 But the wounds on the neck
 are consistent with those
 of a carpenter's claw hammer.

16:13.206 --> 16:17.675
 Fingerprints confirm
 our vic's michael dornan, 18.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.345
 A foster kid who's been in and
 out of juvie since he was 11.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.180
        -That's curious.
        -Why is that?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.716
     Well, the contents
     of his stomach. Look.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.685
 It reads like the main course
 at a shah wedding.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.154
    Wagyu beef.
    Italian white truffles.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.590
   If somebody poured in
   a bottle of bordeaux,
   it would be my dream meal.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.025
       Is there a point?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.427
       You're not much of
       a foodie, are you?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.330
      Wagyu beef is about
      $100 for a filet.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.966
    Italian white truffles
    are about $200 an ounce.

16:41.968 --> 16:45.203
 This street kid had about $500
 worth of food in his stomach.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.404
  How does a down-and-out kid

16:46.406 --> 16:48.106
     Have access
     to that kind of food?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.240
   Has liv had a look at him?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.608
    Sadly, she's home, sick.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.177
   Yeah, i could use her help
   on the cutler case too.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.581
     Our forensics guys
     couldn't find anything
     on simon's laptop.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.450
 I was hoping liv could look at
 it, maybe get some whoo-whoo.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.419
   I was planning on
   dropping in on her later.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.921
 I'd be happy to drop
 the laptop off if you'd like.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.790
       What am i supposed
       to do with it?

17:05.791 --> 17:08.893
  Well, clive thought if you
  handled simon's laptop,
  you might pick something up.

17:08.895 --> 17:12.597
 Yeah, i know how clive thinks
 my fake psychic powers work,
 but what's your endgame here?

17:12.598 --> 17:15.266
     Are you expecting me
     to eat the hard drive?

17:15.268 --> 17:18.169
    It's password protected,
    what am i supposed to...

17:18.171 --> 17:19.436
       (computer chimes)

17:19.439 --> 17:21.539
 Okay. That was kind of creepy.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.673
      Or kind of amazing.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.509
        I've got simon's
        muscle memory.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.444
     Please don't let me be
     opening gross porn.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.213
  -Seriously.
  -(game theme music playing)

17:29.215 --> 17:30.782
    What are the chances
    an agoraphobe in his 20s

17:30.784 --> 17:33.418
       Was not a chronic
       chicken choker?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.253
       What the hell
       is <i> warlock forest?</i>

17:35.255 --> 17:36.888
      Have you been living
      under a crag?

17:36.890 --> 17:39.590
  Which is a large jagged rock
  in <i> warlock forest.</i>

17:39.592 --> 17:42.393
 It's an mmorpg. A multiplayer
 online role playing game.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.896
 Oh, is that one of those games
 where grown men pretend to be

17:44.898 --> 17:47.065
   Warrior gnomes and quest
   after magical knickknacks?

17:47.067 --> 17:50.768
    No. It's one of those
    games where hard-working
    professionals can relax

17:50.770 --> 17:52.637
      Whilst performing
      virtual heroic acts

17:52.639 --> 17:55.206
  That require creativity,
  tactical skill and teamwork,

17:55.208 --> 17:57.308
        While saving the
        moss princess.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.910
     It's a billion-dollar
     industry.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.445
      Some people even get
      paid loads of money

18:00.447 --> 18:02.213
     To level up characters
     that can dominate
     in these games.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.315
      People make money
      playing video games?

18:04.317 --> 18:05.416
  Oh, yeah, it's big business.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.685
        This is dorky...

18:08.621 --> 18:11.689
   Wait, what did i just do?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.925
     Oh, you're a trollock.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.128
      I'm a polish troll?

18:17.130 --> 18:21.732
 You're a troll with warlock
 abilities. The second most
 powerful of all the halflings.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.569
      Those are the people
      you're playing with.
      They saw you log on.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.939
  At 3:00 p.M. On a weekday,
   people are sitting around
  waiting for a polish troll.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.440
    Character: (distorted)
   <i> master! You have returned!</i>

18:29.442 --> 18:30.842
    Hey, who's this jackass?

18:30.844 --> 18:33.344
      <i> All hail sim reaper!</i>

18:33.346 --> 18:34.779
      He's talking to you.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.315
  <i> Your mortal enemy full auto</i>
  <i> has claimed he killed you</i>

18:37.317 --> 18:39.317
   <i> For exterminating</i>
   <i> all of his soul brethren.</i>

18:39.319 --> 18:42.019
   Sim reaper exterminating
   full auto's soul brethren

18:42.021 --> 18:44.789
 Could've cost a serious player
 many thousands of dollars.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.259
   <i> Full auto shall send forth</i>
   <i> waves of minions</i>
   <i> bent on your destruction.</i>

18:48.261 --> 18:49.760
       <i> You must take back</i>
       <i> tree palace.</i>

18:49.762 --> 18:51.462
      You have to respond.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.698
   Everyone uses voice
   modulation, so they
   won't know you're a girl.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.434
      I'm not taking back
      tree palace.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.002
           You must!

18:58.004 --> 18:59.504
    Liv, if anything brought
    me to violence

18:59.506 --> 19:02.006
 It'd be someone exterminating
 my soul brethren.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.709
    You have to play to find
    this full auto guy.
    He could be our killer.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.978
       I don't even know
       what i'm doing.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.647
    Yet i know that
    if i use my freezing rod
    on these fire witches,

19:09.649 --> 19:12.150
 I can take out
 all seven at once.
 But i hate this kind of crap.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.152
    I'll go home and log in.
    I can help you
    from inside the game.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.720
  How will i know who you are?

19:15.722 --> 19:18.656
     I'm a were-terrier
     with healing abilities
     called arf vader.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.857
   This is going to be epic.

19:26.633 --> 19:30.801
 Jerome on computer:
 <i> Aw, man! That's brutal.</i>
 <i> Try to do that one more time.</i>

19:31.471 --> 19:32.803
            Jerome?

19:34.574 --> 19:35.640
        Is it too loud?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.509
       No, i just, uh...

19:40.046 --> 19:42.346
      I heard jerome
      and thought maybe...

19:42.348 --> 19:45.116
    Your optimism is tragic.
    (chuckles)

19:45.118 --> 19:48.819
   It's just old skate stuff
   jerome posted on youtube.
   It's how we share tricks.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.490
 Is there a lot of footage
 like this from the skate park?

19:52.492 --> 19:55.860
      Yeah. There's like
      hundreds of videos,

19:55.862 --> 19:59.664
     And maybe four
     don't completely suck.

20:01.701 --> 20:05.636
    Why are you scoping
    the crowd? It's all
    skate skanks and hobos.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.941
       Okay, keep going.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.842
      Okay, we're going in
      fast and tight.

20:11.844 --> 20:15.079
    If you're casting vapor
    spells, you need to be
     casting as we enter.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.349
 Full auto's all about
 the obscuring veil,
 so remember to stay centered.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.152
   They'll be blasting orbs,
   but if we hit them heavy
         with diviners

20:21.154 --> 20:23.955
  And reserve our gem spells,
  we can take these bitches.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.456
       And this should go
       without saying,

20:25.458 --> 20:27.925
      But don't use
      your multi-crystals
      until we're inside.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.126
          Arf vader...

20:29.128 --> 20:30.528
 Do you have boon to revive us?

20:30.530 --> 20:33.130
   I only have enough boon
   to resurrect four people.

20:33.132 --> 20:36.500
  Timber, you're on recon
  for arf. Okay, we're going.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.269
       Stay in formation!

20:38.271 --> 20:41.072
  Why am i not seeing shields?
  Timber, if we lose arf,
  i will crush you.

20:41.074 --> 20:45.476
 I will drive you into the sea
 and hear the lamentations
 of your women!

20:45.478 --> 20:47.778
   Vapor casters,
   why am i not clouded
   in iridescence right now?

20:47.780 --> 20:49.347
        (clears throat)

20:49.349 --> 20:51.182
            Mom! Hi.

20:51.184 --> 20:53.684
 Peyton told me you were sick.
 I thought i'd come by
 and take care of you.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.254
     Mmm. That's so sweet.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.522
  Wait, who the hell
  just cast an opal rendering?

20:58.524 --> 21:00.591
   -Olivia? I brought you...
   -(clattering)

21:00.593 --> 21:01.926
             Soup.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.028
   I'm sorry. We're storming
   the tree palace right now

21:04.030 --> 21:06.530
 And i've got fire witches
 up my ass and a battalion
 of idiots who don't understand

21:06.532 --> 21:08.499
       What "reserve your
       gem spells" means.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.370
 Well, this is the most engaged
 i've heard you sound
 in a long time.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.972
      I wish it were
      with actual people.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.875
  Honey, i know this has been
  a challenging year.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.278
     And i want you to know
     that i love you.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.913
     And all i want for you
     is to be happy.

21:22.915 --> 21:26.617
 But i worry that you're
 letting your life pass you by.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.519
 Sorry, mom. What did you say?

21:28.521 --> 21:31.555
     Just, sit up straight,
     sweetheart.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.693
    Thank you. For the soup.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.962
       This is important
       police business.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.297
              Hmm.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.633
      We're in! We're in!

21:42.635 --> 21:45.169
  Take this boon and you can't
  be killed for five minutes.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.504
      It's your only boon.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.873
  You need to find full auto.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.808
      Ravi: Oh, my god.
      He's coming for you!

21:50.810 --> 21:53.577
   Character: (distorted)
   <i> sim reaper? I killed you.</i>
   <i> You were dead.</i>

21:53.579 --> 21:54.812
      <i> Vengeance was mine.</i>

21:54.814 --> 21:57.148
    -(computer chimes)
    -yeah. I don't think so.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.518
    My name's olivia moore
    and i'm with the seattle
    police department.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.587
  I need to ask you
  a few questions regarding
  the murder of simon cutler,

22:03.589 --> 22:04.989
   Also known as sim reaper.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.858
   <i> -Seriously?</i>
    -(skype ringtone chiming)

22:10.263 --> 22:11.595
           Full auto?

22:11.597 --> 22:13.397
   <i> Am i gonna need a lawyer?</i>

22:21.607 --> 22:24.709
        -You're full auto?
       <i> -Yeah.</i>

22:24.711 --> 22:27.845
        -How old are you?
       <i> -Fourteen.</i>

22:27.847 --> 22:31.182
   <i> Wait, did you say</i>
   <i> you were from the seattle</i>
   <i> police department?</i>

22:31.184 --> 22:32.750
    <i> Is that where sim reaper</i>
    <i> was from?</i>

22:32.752 --> 22:35.319
       -You didn't know?
       <i> -Well, there were</i>
       <i> a lot of theories.</i>

22:35.321 --> 22:37.288
   <i> There was a whole</i> warlock
    forest <i> thread devoted to</i>

22:37.290 --> 22:40.391
     <i> Who the reaper was</i>
     <i> and where he lived.</i>
     <i> No one knew for sure.</i>

22:41.327 --> 22:43.594
     <i> -So he's really dead?</i>
      -Yes.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.429
    <i> And you think i had</i>
    <i> something to do with it?</i>

22:45.431 --> 22:48.199
    -Well, you threatened him.
   <i> -In a game.</i>

22:48.201 --> 22:51.569
<i> And even if i knew who he was,</i>
<i> how would i get to seattle?</i>

22:51.571 --> 22:53.104
      <i> I live in new york.</i>

22:54.273 --> 22:56.073
    <i> That's the empire state</i>
    <i> building, lady.</i>

22:56.075 --> 22:57.975
            (sighs)

22:57.977 --> 23:02.446
  Fourteen, lives in new york,
  had no idea who simon was
  or where he lived.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.382
    <i> That is depressing news.</i>

23:04.384 --> 23:08.219
     <i> A 14-year-old kid had</i>
     <i> over 20 soul brethren.</i>
     <i> My highest was three.</i>

23:08.221 --> 23:09.787
        (doorbell rings)

23:09.789 --> 23:11.355
         Hang on a sec.

23:16.829 --> 23:20.798
    You sounded overwhelmed
    in your message, so...

23:21.801 --> 23:24.135
       You're giving me
       anti-anxiety meds.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.504
    I ate a brain with ptsd
    a few weeks ago.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.472
 It took four to put a dent
 in it, but it got me through.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.776
 If you're sharing prescription
 drugs with me, i should
 at least offer you a drink.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.517
   I'll call you back later.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.786
     <i> -Of course. Don't do</i>
     <i> anything i wouldn't...</i>
     -(clicks)

23:43.556 --> 23:45.623
             So...

23:45.625 --> 23:49.427
   Did you run out of napkins
   or were you just fondled
   by an oompa loompa?

23:49.429 --> 23:51.729
 There's some on your butt too.
 Not that i was looking.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.764
    I clearly
    was expecting visitors.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.833
   Sorry if it's distracting.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.435
  It's probably the least
  distracting thing about you.

23:57.437 --> 24:00.971
     Whoa. Slow your roll,
     silver-tongued devil.
          Baby steps.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.107
  This is a new thing for me.
  Dating.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.076
     Oh, this isn't a date.
     It's a drop-by.

24:06.078 --> 24:09.146
 Maybe that's what you call it
 in buckingham regalshire.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.549
  Learn your british accents.
  I'm from london.

24:11.551 --> 24:16.320
 And i'm pretty sure "drop by"
 is an american term.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.890
  Whatever this is, i haven't
  done it in a long time.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.660
     And i didn't think
     i'd be doing it again.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.995
 With anyone other than the guy
 i was supposed to marry.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.565
  -You were engaged?
  -Up until i became a zombie.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.568
  And i'm not over it at all.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.936
      I need to get there
      eventually, but...

24:31.938 --> 24:33.938
     -Do you?
     -Need to get over it?

24:33.940 --> 24:35.039
             Yeah.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.474
 Well, what's the alternative?

24:36.476 --> 24:38.242
    Stay in love with a guy
    i can never be with?

24:38.244 --> 24:41.178
    You know people do that
    all the time, right?

24:41.180 --> 24:43.747
 I'm sorry. I'm being that girl
 who talks about her ex.

24:43.749 --> 24:47.852
 Yeah, but you're also the girl
 who had this freakish
 thing happen to her,

24:47.854 --> 24:51.021
   And you're discussing it
   with probably the one guy
     who would understand.

24:51.023 --> 24:55.259
 So, what brings a nice british
 lad like you to seattle?

24:55.261 --> 24:58.529
     Well, i had to escape
     the chilly, wet,

24:58.531 --> 25:00.564
   Depressing london weather.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.867
    So, seattle, naturally.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.468
       There may have
       also been a girl.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.070
   Oh, there's always a girl.

25:06.072 --> 25:09.340
  So, your ex, what's he like?

25:10.343 --> 25:11.775
          Determined.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.046
    Hey, ravi,
    you gotta look at this.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.685
       You see that guy?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.287
      I see a blurry face.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.955
  He's the one who beat me up.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.258
    I've watched a hundred
    of these videos,
    and he keeps popping up.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.326
      But i can't find
      a good shot of him.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.561
    You've popped a stitch.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.531
              Ah.

25:33.533 --> 25:34.598
  I'm gonna run over to liv's.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.000
    Uh, maybe you shouldn't.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.636
  -Uh, it's late.
  -Yeah, she's always up late.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.471
  Ooh, let me. Uh, there's
  a sewing kit in the bathroom

25:40.473 --> 25:43.040
     That i nicked from
     a posh hotel when
     my cousin got married.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.843
 I'd rather not use a hotel
 sewing kit on my face, but...

25:45.845 --> 25:48.579
  I can fix one stitch.
  Major, you really shouldn't.

25:48.581 --> 25:49.713
           (chuckles)

25:49.715 --> 25:51.382
        She's not alone.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.052
          -Sorry.
          -It's fine.

25:56.622 --> 25:58.789
  Thanks for letting me know.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.158
   You woke up in a body bag?
   I'm not kidding,

26:01.160 --> 26:03.427
     I genuinely used
     to have a recurring
     nightmare about that.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.896
   I can see why. You're up.

26:05.898 --> 26:10.301
 My mate's bachelor party.
 I drank too much, passed out,

26:10.303 --> 26:14.772
   Woke up in the drunk tank
   of the county jail
   with a scratch on my leg.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.840
   -No idea how it happened.
   -What the hell?

26:16.842 --> 26:18.409
      How many of us
      are there out there?

26:18.411 --> 26:20.611
 Well, there can't be that many
 if you're the first i've seen.

26:20.613 --> 26:24.481
     And i'd like to think
     that there would be a

26:24.483 --> 26:28.018
 Special bulletin if there
 were roaming packs of zombies.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.219
        How do you eat?

26:29.221 --> 26:32.756
 A funeral home over on baker.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.694
     For the right price,
     a mortician will look
        the other way.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.128
    I assume since you work
    in a morgue...

26:38.130 --> 26:40.297
     You assume correctly.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.865
          Oh, yeah...

26:41.867 --> 26:44.068
   I long for the days
   when i just had to explain

26:44.070 --> 26:47.605
   To some drunk groupie
   how i got the inspiration
   for my songs.

26:47.607 --> 26:51.241
     I'm not really
     the groupie type, but

26:51.243 --> 26:53.377
   Next time you play,
   i'd love to come see you.

26:53.379 --> 26:56.146
     I don't play in public
     anymore.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.948
       A week after
       the bachelor party

26:57.950 --> 27:00.384
  I had a show, went on stage.

27:00.386 --> 27:03.787
      And got that pre-gig
      adrenaline rush,

27:03.789 --> 27:05.556
       And started to...

27:05.558 --> 27:08.158
      You know, um, so...

27:08.160 --> 27:11.462
    For everyone's safety,
    i stopped playing shows.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.998
        I can still play
        in the studio.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.065
         I am so sorry.

27:17.370 --> 27:21.705
     That is so incredibly
     unfair and awful.

27:23.743 --> 27:27.177
     Um, it's... You know,
     it's funny, i, i...

27:27.179 --> 27:29.446
   I didn't think that i was
   the type of guy who wanted

27:29.448 --> 27:31.081
       People to feel bad
       for me, but...

27:33.486 --> 27:36.420
 You just said the exact thing
 i've been dying for someone
 to say to me.

27:43.796 --> 27:46.096
          I am sorry.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.631
   It's fine. I'm just not...

27:47.633 --> 27:50.768
     I, i know you're not.
     Um, uh, you, you...

27:50.770 --> 27:52.903
 Made that very clear. I, um...

27:52.905 --> 27:54.738
    Uh, let's, let's just...

27:55.508 --> 27:58.042
          Whoa! Uh...

27:58.044 --> 28:03.681
  I did not predict that you'd
  be a fan of the slutty
  women of middle earth.

28:03.683 --> 28:07.251
  I'm not blowing you off.
  It's just this is a lead
  in the case i'm working on.

28:07.253 --> 28:10.387
 Of course, um... I should go.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.023
       -It's not about...
       -No, no, no. Uh...

28:14.493 --> 28:16.760
     Our murder victim
     might have been killed
     by a donut.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.362
          I, i get it.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.764
   Thank you. I'll call you.
   Really!

28:27.073 --> 28:28.639
  I'm sorry, but we're closed.

28:28.641 --> 28:30.708
      Detective babineaux,
      seattle pd.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.378
  Have you ever seen this man?

28:34.380 --> 28:35.979
 I can't say he looks familiar.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.715
 Perhaps a coworker could look?

28:37.717 --> 28:41.952
 No, it's just me.
 But leave the photo.
 I'll show the staff tomorrow.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.020
       Out of curiosity,
       what's he done?

28:43.022 --> 28:44.421
            He died.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.925
     Oh, no. That's awful.
     So young.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.528
   He had a very specific
   type of meat and truffle
   combination in his stomach

28:51.530 --> 28:54.431
   That's only sold at a few
   shops here in seattle,
   including this one.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.101
   I figured maybe someone
   here might have seen him.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.669
           (thudding)

28:59.872 --> 29:01.205
      Didn't you say
      you were alone here?

29:01.207 --> 29:04.274
  That's just the ice machine
  dropping a load.

29:04.276 --> 29:08.412
   Scares the hell out of me
   sometimes when i'm here
   by myself.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.982
    Do you wanna
    take a look around,
    detective? Come on back.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.651
     Fair warning, though.
     It is a butcher shop.

29:14.653 --> 29:18.689
   The guts. The carnage.
   It can be like gettysburg
   back there.

29:18.691 --> 29:21.058
      Some people find it
      disturbing. Not me.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.659
 They say you don't wanna know
 how the sausage is made.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.995
      I'm the guy who just
      had to know.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.765
   Come on. I'd love to give
   you the nickel tour.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.801
  You're a homicide detective.
  I'm sure you've seen worse.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.337
     And you have to sample
     the blood pudding.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.272
    It is the best in town.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.476
     (cell phone vibrates)

29:42.815 --> 29:44.014
           Babineaux.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.983
   I've got something
   on the simon cutler case.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.751
     <i> You've gotta see this.</i>

29:47.753 --> 29:51.321
   All right, i'll be there
    in 10. I'm just leaving
   that charcuterie on pine.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.424
     My info is on the back
     of the photo.

29:54.426 --> 29:57.127
    If any of your employees
    remember anything,
    have 'em call me.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.462
          Absolutely.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.543
 Do we know sim reaper's dead?

30:12.545 --> 30:15.913
 We cracked open a 1000-dollar
 bottle of wine that my father
       bequeathed to me.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.447
    We were supposed to hand
    it down to our children.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.617
    But we like to live
    in the moment.
    And this felt like one.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.019
  So you were happy about it?

30:22.021 --> 30:23.654
          -Delighted.
          -Euphoric.

30:23.656 --> 30:26.156
Liv on computer:
<i> Can you reposition me? I can't</i>
<i> really see their faces.</i>

30:26.158 --> 30:28.192
     Oh, sorry about that.

30:28.194 --> 30:32.229
 My partner here found a yelp
 review of your establishment,
 the best all around donuts...

30:32.231 --> 30:33.664
     Former establishment.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.265
 ...Written by the sim reaper.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.633
   <i> Okay, right there is good.</i>

30:36.635 --> 30:38.836
     Which was the online
     alias of simon cutler.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.805
            Mmm-hmm.

30:40.806 --> 30:42.773
<i> "i told these morons</i>
<i> when i ordered their crullers,</i>
<i> 'no peanuts, morons.'</i>

30:42.775 --> 30:46.109
  <i> "but the morons said they</i>
  <i> were nut-free, so i ate them</i>
  <i> and they almost killed me.</i>

30:46.111 --> 30:48.812
     <i> "now i'm taking</i>
     <i> my business elsewhere</i>

30:48.813 --> 30:51.514
<i> "and using every breath i take</i>
<i> to obliterate their pitiful</i>
<i> little crap-shack."</i>

30:51.517 --> 30:54.685
    Not the sort of feedback
    you'd display on your
    cash register, was it?

30:54.687 --> 30:56.420
   Our crullers had no nuts.

30:56.422 --> 30:59.756
 Yeah, after we saw the review,
 we learned that our canola oil

30:59.758 --> 31:02.292
   Comes from a factory
   where they make peanut oil
   in the same machinery.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.894
 Before we could switch brands,
 we were swamped

31:03.896 --> 31:05.229
      With this tidal wave
      of negative reviews.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.164
      "i found a rat tail
      in my maple bar."

31:07.166 --> 31:08.432
  Outrageous stuff like that.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.667
    We put our life savings
    into that place.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.536
    (snaps fingers)
    like that, it was gone.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.205
     I mean, he must've
     generated 50 scathing
     reviews on his own.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.407
   That killed your business.

31:17.409 --> 31:21.245
   If you wanted to kill him,
   it also gave you an idea
   on how to do it.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.479
      Anaphylactic shock.

31:23.716 --> 31:26.617
    That's what killed him?
    The reports didn't say.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.852
  <i> To the rest of the world he</i>
  <i> was this mysterious shut-in.</i>

31:28.854 --> 31:31.188
  <i> But you knew where he lived.</i>
  <i> You brought him crullers.</i>

31:31.190 --> 31:32.856
      We didn't even know
      the guy's real name.

31:32.858 --> 31:34.925
 We delivered crullers to
 a hundred different addresses.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.827
     We weren't delivering
     to sim reaper.

31:36.829 --> 31:39.162
    We likely would've
    remembered that address.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.531
      "simon cutler" meant
      nothing to us.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.071
    Liv on computer:
    <i> They have motive, clive.</i>
    <i> Motive and means.</i>

31:48.073 --> 31:50.574
   <i> But you know what?</i>
   <i> I don't think they did it.</i>

31:50.576 --> 31:53.043
   <i> Maybe you got a different</i>
   <i> vibe sitting there</i>
   <i> in the room with them,</i>

31:53.045 --> 31:56.480
    <i> But from where i sit,</i>

   <i> the man's death.</i>

32:00.686 --> 32:02.185
   Were you saying something?

32:02.187 --> 32:05.289
       (sighs) <i> my gut says</i>
      <i> they're innocent.</i>

32:05.291 --> 32:08.558
<i> Which would mean we're back to</i>
<i> no one knew the guy's address.</i>

32:08.560 --> 32:10.294
    <i> He never left his house.</i>

32:10.296 --> 32:12.596
 <i> That gamer kid i tracked down</i>
 <i> implied that the yelp review</i>

32:12.598 --> 32:15.799
  <i> Was the only clue anyone had</i>
  <i> about where he lived.</i>

     <i> delivered in</i>
     <i> a three-mile radius.</i>

32:18.537 --> 32:20.637
        What did he say?

32:20.639 --> 32:23.640
   He wasn't going to stop
   eating donuts completely.

32:31.050 --> 32:36.219
   <i> There must be other</i>
   <i> donut shops that delivered</i>
   <i> to that same area! Right?</i>

32:36.221 --> 32:38.155
     <i> Are you there, clive?</i>

32:39.358 --> 32:42.059
   <i> Yeah, he probably realized</i>
   <i> what that means.</i>

33:02.581 --> 33:05.248
   -I thought it was broken.
   -Oh, it was.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.150
    It works intermittently.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.753
      Must be a loose wire
      or something.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.054
         Or something.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.292
      What you working on?

33:15.294 --> 33:19.896
     Oh, one of my clients
     wants a trend analysis
     report on nesting.

33:19.898 --> 33:23.433
 Is it over, or is it
 transitioning into cocooning?

33:24.069 --> 33:25.802
              Huh!

33:25.804 --> 33:28.372
      Here's what happened
      today on my job.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.508
   A cop came in looking
   for my dead delivery boy.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.612
             Dead?

33:35.614 --> 33:36.880
        That's terrible.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.383
          Oh, jackie.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.352
      Nesting is so over.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.453

33:51.330 --> 33:53.764
   The crime scene photos
   from simon's basement show

33:53.766 --> 33:55.799
      Several empty boxes
      from donuts etc.

33:55.801 --> 33:59.236
   I spoke to the manager
   and he wouldn't provide me
   with a list of employees.

33:59.238 --> 34:03.040
 He said he'd need a warrant.
 I'm not sure a judge is gonna
    buy our logic on this.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.475
   -The donuts etc. On king?
   -Yeah. Why?

 I hope you also took the bus.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.200
        -What's up?
        -I had a vision.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.736
     It was the moment
     that the birthday card
     shot confetti

36:12.738 --> 36:15.872
 And peanut dust
 into the face of simon cutler.

36:15.874 --> 36:20.710
 It was just as we pe-spected.
 Subsected? Suspected?

36:20.712 --> 36:24.181
  But there was another thing.
  The card had
  a music chip in it.

36:24.183 --> 36:27.217
     When cutler opened it,
     <i> ring around the rosie</i>
     started playing.

36:27.219 --> 36:31.288
   A message from the killer.
   He wanted cutler
   to know who he was.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.958
  Cutler stepped on the card.
  The chip must have fallen
  into the deep shag.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.661
   You know,
   if we can get the list of
   donuts etc. Employees,

36:37.663 --> 36:40.197
     We can see if there
     are any names on there
     that make sense.

36:40.199 --> 36:43.099
    Uh, yeah. I got my hands
    on just such a list.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.835
  Don't ask, and i won't lie.

   I don't suppose there was
   a rosie on the list?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.440
       Or a freddy ring?

36:50.442 --> 36:52.275
      That song was about
      the black plague.

36:52.277 --> 36:55.612
  The black plague was caused
  by rats, and there was
  a ratzinger on the list

36:55.614 --> 36:58.048
  With a birthday last month,
  but that's not our guy.

36:58.050 --> 37:01.251
    You know who our guy is?
    You wanna just share?

37:01.253 --> 37:03.320
    I'm building the drama.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.288
  I'm at the edge of my seat.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.328
   Yeah, i've seen this guy.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.731
     From the crime scene.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.534
     "did he suffer?"
     that's what he asked.

37:17.536 --> 37:21.538
   And his name? Sean posey.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.807
  As in, "pocketful of posies,
  we all fall down."

37:23.809 --> 37:25.709
     I got that shot
     off his facebook page.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.044
  Tell me his birthday matches
  the date of the murder.

37:28.046 --> 37:31.681
     No such luck.
     But his sister's does.

37:33.819 --> 37:37.520
     Okay, enough with
     the escalating drama.
     Who's his sister?

37:37.522 --> 37:39.789
    Shanie on recording:
    <i> Your name, then.</i>
    <i> I'm happy to look it up.</i>

37:39.791 --> 37:44.327
  Simon: (distorted)
  <i> i am the sim reaper, shanie.</i>
  <i> I am the keeper of the web.</i>

37:44.329 --> 37:48.498
 <i> Ceos of fortune 500 companies</i>
 <i> tremble before me.</i>

37:48.500 --> 37:51.935
  <i> I am invisible, intangible,</i>
  <i> untouchable.</i>

37:51.937 --> 37:54.437
       <i> I am the bringer</i>
       <i> of cyber-darkness.</i>

37:54.439 --> 37:58.608
<i> Fail me, and i will delete you</i>
<i> like so much digital noise.</i>

38:02.314 --> 38:04.614
     What a ridiculous man.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.316
     But not one
     to make idle threats.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.220
  Your sister posted the call
  on her facebook page.

38:10.222 --> 38:12.322
       One of her friends
       put it on youtube.

38:12.324 --> 38:16.559
  Two million hits later,
  he hacked into all of your
  sister's personal accounts.

38:16.561 --> 38:19.729
       Facebook, okcupid,
       instagram, e-mail.

38:19.731 --> 38:23.333
   He messed with all of her
   tax records and insurance,
   medical, dmv.

38:23.335 --> 38:27.404
      Posted photoshopped
      pornographic images
      of her on twitter.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.540
     He destroyed her life.

38:30.542 --> 38:35.078
  Got her fired.
  Broke up her relationship.
  Gave her a criminal record.

38:35.080 --> 38:40.116
    Put her on sex offender
    and no-fly lists.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.184
        Humiliated her.

38:43.755 --> 38:47.390
      After a year of that
      harassment,

38:47.392 --> 38:50.427
 She couldn't take it anymore,

38:50.429 --> 38:54.197
    So she went to
    the aurora bridge
    and jumped to her death.

38:54.199 --> 38:58.835
 Your only clue to sim reaper's
 real identity was the best all
      around donuts review.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.770
   That gave you a three-mile
   delivery radius.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.907
   So you got a job
   at a donut shop
   that served the same area.

39:03.909 --> 39:08.445
   I got jobs at three donut
   shops in the area
   before i found him.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.617
 You have a finance degree from
 the university of chicago.

39:14.619 --> 39:17.420
      Weren't you a little
      overqualified
      to deliver donuts?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.727
  You realize you'll probably

39:23.729 --> 39:25.862
     Spend the rest
     of your life in jail.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.602
        It was worth it.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.512
   Liv: <i> Sean posey</i>
  <i> let a tragedy ruin his life.</i>

39:42.514 --> 39:45.148
  <i> His sister died,</i>
  <i> and he couldn't get past it.</i>

39:45.150 --> 39:47.450
   <i> Now two lives are ruined.</i>

39:47.452 --> 39:51.221
     <i> What was it mom said?</i>
     <i> Right before</i>
     <i> "sit up straight"?</i>

39:51.223 --> 39:53.757
  <i> Something about not letting</i>
  <i> life pass me by.</i>

39:55.494 --> 39:57.327
         (liv whistles)

40:01.333 --> 40:02.399
              Hey.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.634
              Hey.

40:04.636 --> 40:08.505
    I thought maybe we could
    pick up the date
    from where we left off.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.643
    I think we left off
    at me awkwardly
    fleeing your apartment.

40:13.645 --> 40:18.782
  A little before that, then.
  The part where you made
  a move and i ducked it.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.251
      Yes, please.
      Let me relive that.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.887
      It wasn't my finest
      moment, either.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.656
  You spent six years
  thinking your life was going
  in a different direction.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.725
     I think you're allowed
     a duck or two.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.560
   I get it.
   You're still not over him.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.596
  No. But i'm a little closer.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.999
      Liv, it's fine.
      I'm in no rush to...

40:44.843 --> 40:46.709
     Argh! That's rubbish.

40:46.711 --> 40:49.145
  You're rubbish.
  And i am the man
  that takes out the rubbish.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.781
  Hey! I found a good,
  clean shot of the candyman!

40:51.783 --> 40:53.450
        Check your text!

40:53.452 --> 40:55.952
    No worries. I can check
    my phone, trim my beard,

40:55.954 --> 40:58.721
     And still trounce
     this pathetic pillock.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.932
    Do you think she sucked
    the marrow from life?

41:08.934 --> 41:11.835
  I think she did. She
  looks like a marrow-sucker.

41:11.837 --> 41:12.969
   Forget her. Look at this.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.539
    Major found the candyman
    and someone else.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.978
  Blaine isn't robbing graves
  to feed himself.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.914
      It would appear not.

41:24.916 --> 41:29.185
     All those kids missing
     from the skate park...
         Major's kids...

41:31.690 --> 41:35.391
  Eva: I'm glad
  you found this space.
  You're so close to my house.

41:36.928 --> 41:40.163
  Although my waistline wishes
  you were in tacoma.

41:40.165 --> 41:45.268
   Ooh! Hello.
   Rabbit pistachio terrine.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.705
  You're hiring?
  Because my son needs a job.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.174
  He's 16. Is that too young?

41:53.545 --> 41:57.013
    Let's have him
    fill out an application,
    see what happens.
