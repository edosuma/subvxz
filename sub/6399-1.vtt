Just do me
a quick favor, mate,

06:25.440 --> 06:26.920

Oh, no, I've got to go

what come over me.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.360
Sorry. Shouting at you
was the wrong thing.

It's all right, man.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.760
What's your name?

Whoa, me, I'm really sorry.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.080

Man, I got some gear.

10:47.640 --> 10:48.600
Yeah, put it together.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.800
Let's do some
of Sonny's gear.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.280
You need to chill out.

Uh, you've had
enough of that.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.080
Check on your stuff
and don't touch the action.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.960
Don't touch the action.

Listen, Tuff.
Was in farm.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.760
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.280
Doing me dealing, right?
You know what I mean?

11:04.280 --> 11:05.400
Had to scout about and stuff,

11:05.400 --> 11:07.040
and as soon
as I waltz in,

11:07.080 --> 11:08.160
there was this
fucking bloke

11:08.200 --> 11:10.160

a butcher's at me.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.480
Went over, like, "Do you
want a fucking picture?

11:12.480 --> 11:14.320
What's going on?"
He's like, "Huh?"

11:14.320 --> 11:15.880
Mongrel can hardly speak.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.360
And then I says,
"Listen.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.080
What the fuckin' hell
are you looking at?"

11:19.120 --> 11:21.240
He goes,
"You, you cunt!"

11:21.240 --> 11:23.120
Get out.
Seriously, man.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.840
So I go down to club
seeking Sonny, don't I?

11:25.880 --> 11:26.800
So I'm coming out--

11:26.840 --> 11:27.960
coming out back
of the club.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.400
You know where
the stairs are?

11:29.400 --> 11:29.680
Yeah.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.800
Was on me phone.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.400
Next minute, "Aah,"
he's right there.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.160
I'm fucking
like a ghost, man.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.800
[laughter]
What that?

11:35.800 --> 11:36.960
Faint now, dead.
Know what I mean?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.440
So I faint now.
Know what I mean?

11:38.440 --> 11:39.480
Were you sweating,
though?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.000
I was like whoa, but he
starts apologizing.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.720
The guy comes
up to you,

11:42.760 --> 11:44.400
more or less
threatens you.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.640
Then he jumps
out on you

11:45.640 --> 11:47.520
going to fucking work,
and you shake his hand?

11:47.560 --> 11:48.960
That's what I mean.
Freaky, innit?

11:49.000 --> 11:49.920
No, you're
fucking freaky.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.040
You know what
I think it is?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.240
I've been racking me
brains all bastard day.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.720
Yeah, it's a local
lunatic, innit?

11:56.720 --> 11:59.320
Hey, Tuff.
Anthony's brother.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.000
It was Anthony's
brother, man.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.560
Don't crowd him,
all right?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.000
You're making him
nervous.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.280
I know you got to go,

12:30.280 --> 12:32.480
but let me just say
one thing, all right?

12:32.480 --> 12:34.000
I don't mind.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.160
I just don't like when
people are just fucking rude.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.360
You know what I'm saying?

12:37.400 --> 12:40.360
I'm sorry I hit you before.
I didn't mean to.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.200
Yeah? There's no
blood, is there?

12:42.200 --> 12:45.480
Huh? Huh?

12:45.480 --> 12:46.880
[Men]
Yeah!

12:46.880 --> 12:48.440
That isn't a bloodstain.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.520
That isn't
a bloodstain, is it?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.040
At this pace,
it'll give you

12:52.040 --> 12:54.080
the appetite
of an artist.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.920
No, no, no.
Trust me.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.920
[coughs]

13:02.480 --> 13:04.840
I don't like
one of these things here.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.720
Blow for me, mate.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.400
[coughing]
[laughter]

13:11.800 --> 13:13.440
I don't want him
to do any more.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.720
Oh, come on, man.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.480
He don't want
to do any more.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.640
No, but listen.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.840
What you got to do is,
if you do want...

13:27.240 --> 13:28.960
Has he gone?
Did I miss it?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.160
Did I miss
the other one?

13:32.520 --> 13:33.880
He's real
fucking paranoid.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.320
Come on.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.440
Keep your hands
off of him.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.920
It was weird in town
today, weren't it?

13:58.920 --> 14:00.080
Weren't it?

14:00.080 --> 14:01.840
Don't change,
does it?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.720
No, sure as shit no.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.640
No, it weren't.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.720
What are them little
lines in your hair?

14:10.720 --> 14:12.200
What, them?
Mm.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.280
You did them.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.200
I certainly did not.
Yeah, you did.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.880
No, I didn't.
When you cut it.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.600
Are you trying to
look like a gangster?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.080
No, I'm gonna
grow it anyway.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.520
What are you
growing it like?

14:22.520 --> 14:23.840
Don't know. Long hair.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.960
Like Bon Jovi.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.880
No.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.880
I'm gonna have to go

14:31.880 --> 14:33.440
back to town in a bit,
mate,

14:33.440 --> 14:36.280
to sort some
business out.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.480
I don't want
to go, Richard.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.800
You don't have to.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.680
Is that Sonny's
stuff, yeah?

14:48.680 --> 14:49.880
He's gonna go mad.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.040
He's not gonna
go mad.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.200
Sonny can share.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.440
Oh, no, man.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.400
We got to do an experiment
for the mix.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.880
And you have been chosen
as the lead astronaut.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.760
Fucking opinion
as a connoisseur.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.720
Go on, have
a go at that.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.360
Whoa, what you up to?

15:04.360 --> 15:06.360
Come on, give me it.
Come on. Come on.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.800
Let me into
your thoughts.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.400
It's an interesting one,
this.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.640
Give me your thoughts.
Come on.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.120
Don't think
about it too much.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.480
Byzantine period.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.920
[laughter]

15:15.920 --> 15:16.880
Byzantine period.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.080
I'll give you
a clue, man.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.400
Italy.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.880
Italy?
Italy.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.240
It's for the Italians.
It's for the Italians.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.840
But you say that now.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.760
<i>♪ It's amore ♪</i>

15:27.760 --> 15:30.080
It's fucking
parmesan cheese!

15:30.080 --> 15:31.760
You dirty bastard.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.480
Fuck off.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.560
Fuck you.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.000
All right, I'm off.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.120
I'm off, Gage.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.320
Are you sure
you can make it?

15:39.360 --> 15:39.560
Yeah.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.520
I'll strut my way
and all that.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.880
You must be
fucking cursed.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.200
I'll fucking
nightmare you.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.640
See you in a bit, yeah?
See you in a bit.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.840
Hey, take care.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.080
See you in a bit.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.360
Say hello to Sonny.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.480
Yeah, I will, mate.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.960
Oh, man, he's off
his fucking trolley.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.880
Have you seen him?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.320
Fuckin' hell.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.760
Fuckin' hell, man.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.120
Fuckin' hell! Tuff!

16:16.120 --> 16:18.040
Tuff!

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
Listen!

16:21.520 --> 16:23.800
There's a man
standing at the door

16:23.800 --> 16:24.960
with massive eyes.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.680
It looks like his
fucking eyes are on fire.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.600
Come on. Come on.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.320
He was still down there.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.280
Shh!

16:34.320 --> 16:35.800
He was--He was
still there.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.400
He had a mask.
He had a mask.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.920
His eyes were massive!

16:39.960 --> 16:41.600
[stammering]
Like an elephant.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.760
Well, where is he?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.640
He was still there
when the door closed.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.040
He had this big
suit on, man.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.080
Massive eyes, man,
I'm telling you.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.360
You think this is
funny, Herbie?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.800
You guys really run
around like fools,

16:51.800 --> 16:52.320
either of you.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.720
I ain't jokin'.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.200
What can I say?

16:55.240 --> 16:56.920
I'm not
making it up!

16:56.920 --> 16:58.240
He had massive eyes!

16:58.280 --> 17:00.040
I'm stopping
here tonight.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.520
You're not stopping
at my house.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.440
I'm stopping here.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.920
[all arguing]

17:05.920 --> 17:07.400
Just let me
stop here!

17:07.440 --> 17:09.160
I'm not gonna
piss about, am I?

17:09.160 --> 17:11.760
Get your fucking
stuff and get--

17:11.760 --> 17:13.680
Fuckin' hell, man.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.600
What the fuck's that?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.680
What the fuck was
I telling you?

17:18.680 --> 17:21.240
He fucking broke
into me fucking flat.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.720
Hey!
Hey!

17:22.720 --> 17:23.960
Where's Sonny's gear?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.360
We'll find you,
bastard!

17:25.360 --> 17:26.560
What's up?
Where's Sonny's

17:26.560 --> 17:27.040
gear, man?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.480
We'll find you!

17:29.480 --> 17:30.440
Fuckin' hell.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.440
Where was it, man?

17:31.440 --> 17:32.840
It was on
the fucking table.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.080
Where's Sonny's gear?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.080
Check your pockets.
Check your pockets.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.120
I don't fucking
have it.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.720
I didn't go out
with it, did I?

17:39.720 --> 17:40.960
Check 'em anyway,
you twat!

17:40.960 --> 17:42.880
These just fell down.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.040
Haven't got the food.

17:45.040 --> 17:45.800
What was her name?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.000
Cynthia.

17:47.000 --> 17:47.880
No. Ruby. Ruby.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.360
No.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.760
she had a break,
and it broke in two.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.080
That was a dog.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.000
She's a fucking dog!

17:54.040 --> 17:55.480
Spoke with her
for 2 1/2 hours.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.040
You lay the fuck off.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.440
You fell asleep.
You fell asleep.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.640
Fell a-fuckin'-sleep.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.600
[laughter]

18:01.800 --> 18:03.160
Get in the door.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.840
You fell asleep.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.480
Listen, you fuckin' A.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.160

19:24.720 --> 19:26.360
Man, I was
enjoying that.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.240
[sighs and coughs]

19:29.240 --> 19:32.040
Right, Herbie, I think you
better tell him, innit?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.000
I've gotta tell him?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.120
It's your story.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.760
Well, I know.
You guys can help tell it.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.400
Well, we don't know it, do we?
We don't know the story.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.560
Just tell him
the gear's gone.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.080
End of story.

19:40.080 --> 19:40.960
Full stop.
Straight in

19:41.000 --> 19:41.400
with that.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.640
He's gonna think
I'm on it, isn't he?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.280
You're supposed to give him
the bad news first, man.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.600
'Cause you can't
do anything about it.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.520
Just tell him
about the drugs, man.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.240
He's figuring it's funny.
He's gonna go apeshit over that.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.240
The flat's been trashed,
it's been painted

19:51.240 --> 19:51.800
on the wall.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.880
Yeah, tell him about
the elephant, what?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.280
Don't mention
the elephant.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.360
Don't mention
the elephant,

19:56.400 --> 19:57.760
Herbie. Honestly.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.040
Give a shout.
Give a shout.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.400
Sonny, mate?
Sonny, it's

20:01.400 --> 20:02.440
like an emergency.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.480
Gotta tell you somethin'.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.600
[shouting from inside]

20:04.600 --> 20:07.160
Well, he's banging about
now, is he?

20:07.160 --> 20:08.320
We're coming back.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.960
[knocks loudly]

20:09.960 --> 20:11.760
Banging?
What are you--

20:11.800 --> 20:14.160
Who's banging on
the fucking door? You, eh?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.200
What's all here?

20:15.200 --> 20:16.800
I didn't bang
on the door, man.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.040
Well?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.760
Are you all right, mate?

20:20.800 --> 20:23.080
I'm all right.
What you want?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.520
Sonny, we need to
have a word inside.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.480
We'll have a word.
What you want?

20:27.480 --> 20:28.440
Well, go inside, eh?

20:28.440 --> 20:29.280
Best we go inside, Sonny.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.400
It won't take long,
mate.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.360
Get in.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.280
We need to speak
to you.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.040
Eh?

20:36.040 --> 20:37.800
Not out here, man.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.680
All right,
who banged on the door?

20:39.680 --> 20:40.720
I didn't
bang on the door.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.120
Herbie, don't--
Who banged on the door?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.360
I don't know.
I didn't bang on the door.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.680
Herbie, I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.520
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't bang on your door.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.560
Fucking pills
and everything.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.400
How many pills?
What are they?

21:00.400 --> 21:01.440
Put a few of these in?

21:01.440 --> 21:03.520
Yeah.

21:03.560 --> 21:07.480
Do you know why people
give kids drugs?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.200
So they can
control their minds.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.960
Because they're fucking
weak-minded themselves.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.560
They're not even
animals, mate.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.840
Fuck it.
I'll just put all that in.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.640
Look at that, mate.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.440
Fuckin' hell.
That's acid.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.440
Yeah.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.040
What you gonna
do with it?

21:34.040 --> 21:36.920
I'm gonna give 'em
a super-duper fuckin' dose.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.320
I'm gonna send 'em
to space, man.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.280
Yeah.
Mmm.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.120
The space you ain't
fucking coming back

21:43.120 --> 21:43.760
though, baby.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.680
No.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.680
Cheeky bastard, though,
wreckin' our flat.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.640
Did you see
what he did to his face?

21:49.680 --> 21:51.000
Come in and
put that on his face.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.320
He don't even nit-know,
do you know what I mean?

21:53.360 --> 21:55.240
You know what I think,
he's maybe fuckin'

21:55.280 --> 21:56.040
mental bastard--

21:56.040 --> 21:58.280
If he can get in here
and do that one--

21:58.280 --> 22:00.320
He can do what he wants.
He's trained, man. I told ya.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.120
He's not gonna
buy this story anyway.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.720
He's pissed off.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.960
Oh, here
he comes.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.840
Aye, Sonny.
How's it goin' now, man?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.240
Still a little bit there.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.480
Well, I thought
we had a deal, fellas.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.000
[Mark]
What do you mean,

22:24.000 --> 22:24.440
a deal?

22:24.440 --> 22:27.200
That's not us.
We ain't done that.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.320
He came 'round me flat, man.
He came 'round me flat

22:29.320 --> 22:29.960
and wrecked it.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.600
Put all this writing
on the wall.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.440
Smashed me lamp.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.520
Have you touched my gear?
Have you been

22:34.520 --> 22:35.600
using my gear, mate?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.000
We went out the flat,
left it on the table

22:37.000 --> 22:37.600
for five minutes.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.240
Hav you been usin'--
I'm not asking you that.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.600
I'm askin' if you've
been usin' the gear.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.560
No, I don't get off
your gear, we sell it.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.200
I don't touch it.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.840
Tuff?

22:45.840 --> 22:47.760
I ain't touched it, man.
I ain't touched it.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.080
He's seen the geezer.
Tell 'em, Herbie.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.080
That's what I'm sayin'.
This guy follows us all day.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.880
We go bang off the edge,
we see the elephant--

22:56.920 --> 22:58.880
It's an elephant? Eh?

23:00.920 --> 23:02.400
[Sonny]
Elephant?

23:02.400 --> 23:03.520
Fuck.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.440
Fire away, mate.
Fast as you can.

23:05.440 --> 23:05.800
Go on.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.240
So, at the club,
the other night,

23:07.240 --> 23:08.760
and he said
that and stuff,

23:08.760 --> 23:10.120
he followed me--
Said what?

23:10.120 --> 23:11.120
He called me a cunt.
Okay.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.800
And I saw him
earlier in the day, mate.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.600
Out the back of your club
when I come and seen you.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.280
He was at my club?

23:16.280 --> 23:17.880
Yeah, he was
at your club at the back.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.160
Same fellow?
Same guy.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.560
But I'm thinking
about this all day, man,

23:20.560 --> 23:21.720
'cause it's weird,
you know what I mean?

23:21.760 --> 23:24.200
So that's when, you know,
I went to Tuff's

23:24.200 --> 23:26.320
to just chill out, man,
you know what I mean?

23:26.320 --> 23:27.360
Sort me head out and stuff.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.160
And that's when
I come downstairs,

23:29.200 --> 23:30.640
and this thing's there,
it's right there

23:30.680 --> 23:31.400
at the glass, mate.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.360
What's this thing?

23:32.360 --> 23:33.360
This elephant thing.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.640
Fuckin' hell.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.920
I told him not to mention
fuckin' elephants.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.040
Now, the problem I have
is my gear's gone,

23:39.040 --> 23:40.760
and you're talkin'
about elephants, okay?

23:40.760 --> 23:43.120
Just nice and easy,
tell me what it is,

23:43.120 --> 23:44.040
and we'll deal.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.000
I'm saying--

23:45.000 --> 23:46.280
Who is the elephant man?

23:46.280 --> 23:49.200
It's-- It's--
Anthony's brother, innit?

23:49.200 --> 23:52.360
It's Anthony's brother.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.760
I swear man.
I swear, it's Anthony's

23:54.760 --> 23:55.840
brother Richard.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.440
Hello. Hello.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.360
[chattering]

24:12.480 --> 24:16.720
...and you talked to me,
and you become my friend,

24:16.720 --> 24:20.040
and then you let
these fucking idiots

24:20.040 --> 24:22.040
maul you and touch you
and feel you?

24:22.080 --> 24:23.400
What's wrong with you?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.400
You know why
your brother left?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.360
Because you are a retard.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.040
That's what he told me.
That's what he told

24:29.040 --> 24:29.720
the neighborhood.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.960
"My brother Anthony
is a fucking retard,

24:33.000 --> 24:34.320
"so I'm going to go
into the army

24:34.320 --> 24:37.600
and I'm gonna run
a fucking million miles away."

24:37.640 --> 24:40.440
I'm telling you,
you are fucking

24:40.440 --> 24:42.520
difficult to deal with.

24:42.520 --> 24:46.080
And when you're here,
you've got to abide

24:46.120 --> 24:47.160
by my rules.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.080
Okay?

24:49.120 --> 24:53.160
Well, here I have
a special game for you.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.680
It's a very special
game, okay?

24:55.680 --> 25:01.240
We play Anthony
sucks Sonny's dick.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.360
I put this big cock
in your mouth

25:03.400 --> 25:04.440
and you suck it.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.680
You wanna play that game?

25:05.680 --> 25:06.680
Or if you don't
wanna play that game,

25:06.680 --> 25:08.200
you can have
the mystery prize.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.760
Now what's it gonna be?
Huh? What's it gonna be?

25:10.760 --> 25:12.480
You have got
three seconds to answer.

25:12.480 --> 25:17.280
It is suck my cock
or mystery prize.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.760
What you wanna play?

25:18.800 --> 25:21.640
1, 2-- What is it?
What do you want to play?

25:21.640 --> 25:23.840
I'll play the mystery--

25:32.640 --> 25:36.320
You're such
a fuckin' idiot.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.640
[cries]

25:47.520 --> 25:48.560
Does it work?

25:48.560 --> 25:52.200
No, it's
a piece of shit.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.560
Oh, that's
a shame.

25:53.560 --> 25:54.680
Don't go climbin' in it.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.760
No, I won't.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.320
[whistles]

26:05.320 --> 26:06.280
Look at that.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.360
I think I could use that...

26:08.360 --> 26:09.320
for somethin'.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.280
Proper, that.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.120
It's a bit blunt.

26:12.160 --> 26:15.040
Blunt.
It's old.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.120
[Sonny]
Did you see him?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.120
Well, I didn't
actually see him, no.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.200
But Herbie saw him.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.760
I mean, he was
fuckin' scared, man.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.360
I've not seen him.
We were outside the flat

26:26.360 --> 26:26.920
when he did it.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.920
It's only Herbie
who's seen him.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.000
I mean,
how did he get here?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.920
Do you know what I mean?
He's clever, man.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.000
How's he got in here?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.120
How clever is that?
Do you know what I mean?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.280
He's done his flat
in three minutes.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.560
Sorry to barge in.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.240
Just want a quick word
with these three twats!

26:40.280 --> 26:41.720
What the fuck
are you on about?

26:41.760 --> 26:43.800
We had an agreement.
No pissing about.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.720
Right? Well, who's
done that, you twats?

26:46.720 --> 26:48.720
What's so
bloody funny, eh?

26:48.720 --> 26:49.880
It's not just that.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.320
Find out how did that,
you fuckin' twats!

26:52.360 --> 26:54.520
Find out--

26:54.520 --> 26:57.720
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

26:57.720 --> 27:00.480
[everyone shouting at once]

27:00.480 --> 27:04.880
Shut up, will you?
Shut up!

27:04.920 --> 27:07.120
I'll tell him
in me own time.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.520
Herbie tells us
we have a little

27:09.520 --> 27:10.760
visitor in town.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.200
Tell him what
we have, Herbie.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.680
Anthony's brother's back.
That's who it is.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.240
He's messing with us.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.920
If you're winding me up,
you twat...

27:17.920 --> 27:19.160
[Herbie]
No, he's like

27:19.160 --> 27:20.120
a commando, man.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.400
Hang on.
Hang on.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.520
Coming through
the window.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.960
Sonny, are they
telling the truth?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.400
Are they right or what?

27:25.440 --> 27:27.520
Who'd have the balls
to do that? Eh?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.120
What's it say, man?

27:29.160 --> 27:30.160
Never mind what it says.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.640
Eh, listen,
you pikey cunt.

27:32.640 --> 27:33.400
Shut up.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.880
What about the girl?

27:34.880 --> 27:37.160
Aye. Patti?

27:37.200 --> 27:39.440
Yeah. Where's she?

27:39.440 --> 27:40.960
She's a fucking slag, man.
Big-mouthed slag.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.920
Yeah, big mouth.
Someone's...

27:41.920 --> 27:44.200
[audio fades out]

27:48.760 --> 27:51.360
[people shouting]

27:56.880 --> 27:57.840
You're having a laugh.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.800
No, I'm not.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.440
I'm not fucking Norma.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.240
I mean--
No, I'm not doing it.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.280
Now can I go
downstairs, please?

28:06.280 --> 28:08.840
If that is your choice,
what can I do?

28:08.840 --> 28:11.200
What can you do?

28:11.200 --> 28:12.560
Get out!

28:12.560 --> 28:13.640
You give my fucking
set of keys?

28:13.680 --> 28:14.000
What keys?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.280
No, Sonny! Please!

28:16.280 --> 28:18.840
Don't lie to me, Patti.
Don't lie to me.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.480
I'll do it! Ah!
I'll do anything!

28:20.480 --> 28:22.920
You wanna fuck him?
Huh, do ya?

28:27.000 --> 28:30.360
Hey. It's been
a while, hasn't it?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.840
[audio fades]

28:37.760 --> 28:40.240
[Patti screaming
and shouting]

28:42.280 --> 28:44.040
There's all my boys. Yay!

28:44.080 --> 28:45.520
That's a cute
little urchin.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.000
She's a sweetheart.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.960
What are you doing there?

28:51.960 --> 28:53.200
What are you doing there?

28:53.240 --> 28:54.400
Get him out of my home.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.360
Where's your key?

28:55.360 --> 28:56.320
He's behaving.
He's sane.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.520
Just do as your told.
Tell me the truth.

29:01.760 --> 29:04.360
Ah! What are you doing?

29:09.120 --> 29:11.480
[men talking at once]

29:13.320 --> 29:16.360
[Patti grunting]

29:21.040 --> 29:24.760
[men shouting]

29:28.120 --> 29:30.160
Not shagged.
No one's squatting.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.320
Please, just--

29:32.320 --> 29:35.040
You look your age.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.960
You can piss off, you.

29:41.720 --> 29:45.080
She sounded honest, right?

29:45.080 --> 29:47.560
Cow! It's only
a fucking shag!

29:47.560 --> 29:49.760
A fucking shag
with a--fucking hell!

29:49.760 --> 29:52.600
[everyone talking]

29:52.600 --> 29:56.080
Congratulations.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.040
[audio fades out]

30:13.080 --> 30:17.520
No, you ain't going anywhere.
We have things to do.

30:17.520 --> 30:22.320
[people talking]

30:22.320 --> 30:24.480
Whoa! Slow the car!
Slow the car!

30:24.480 --> 30:25.360
He's fucking there!

30:25.360 --> 30:27.880
Go down there, boy.
Back up.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.560
[people muttering in car]

30:36.360 --> 30:39.520
Just stay here, all right?
I'll do this.

30:47.760 --> 30:51.960
Hey man,
how you doin'? Rich.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.600
You okay?

30:54.600 --> 30:56.240
Mm-hmm.

30:56.240 --> 30:59.240
Yeah?

30:59.280 --> 31:01.000
You know the lads had
this ridiculous idea th--

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, it was me.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.840
Oh, it was? Thought so.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.560
What are you up to?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.320
Moochin' about.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.240
Moochin' about?
In my house?

31:11.240 --> 31:14.280
Mmm.

31:14.280 --> 31:18.800
Do you always
paint men like women?

31:21.000 --> 31:24.600
What are you doin',
lad?

31:24.640 --> 31:26.600
That's my concern.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.840
Not with me in my house.
Where are you staying?

31:30.840 --> 31:31.840
Motson's farm.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.440
Gonna come
and see me, are ya?

31:34.480 --> 31:35.520
Maybe I will.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.640
Oh.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.360
You're not
afraid of me, are ya?

31:42.320 --> 31:43.840
Why doesn't he
just chin him?

31:43.840 --> 31:46.160
He's weighing him up.
He's weighing him up.

31:46.160 --> 31:46.600
Shut up.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.200
You're making me
very nervous, Richard.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.400
Well, you should be.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.400
If I were you,

31:55.400 --> 31:59.160
I'd get in that fuckin' car,
and I'd get out of here, man.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.080
I'd gather them goonies
and get whatever you've got,

32:01.080 --> 32:02.680
and come at me...

32:02.680 --> 32:04.920
'cause I'm gonna
fucking hit you all.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.240
I don't like being
threatened, Richard.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.960
I'm not threatening
you, mate.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.080
It's beyond
fucking words.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.440
I watched over you
when you were asleep,

32:14.440 --> 32:15.840
and I looked
at your fucking neck,

32:15.840 --> 32:20.600
and I was that far away
from slicing it.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.280
You're fucking there,
mate!

32:23.320 --> 32:27.800
So get in that car
and fuck off.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.200
You get to me first.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.240
I just might.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.080
What's he doing?

32:37.120 --> 32:38.360
He's coming back.
He's coming back.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.280
Is that it?

32:45.520 --> 32:48.840
[car engine revving]

32:56.600 --> 32:57.520
<i>[Sonny]
He ain't goin' away, fellas.</i>

32:57.560 --> 32:59.600
It's that simple.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.840
I saw him. I looked
right in the eye,

33:01.840 --> 33:03.680
and he ain't
the same guy that left.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.800
Did he mention us?

33:05.800 --> 33:07.160
[Sonny]
Yeah, he did.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.760
He invited us all
over whenever we

33:08.760 --> 33:09.760
wanna go and see him.

33:09.760 --> 33:10.920
Said, "Please
come and see me.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.640
Invite the lads."

33:11.640 --> 33:12.800
Quite poetic,
isn't he?

33:12.840 --> 33:14.200
Fuckin' invited us.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.120
Mental.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.160
Where's he at?

33:18.160 --> 33:19.280
He's at Mottson's.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.960
The farm?
Yeah.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.040
Well, what you
want us to do?

33:24.040 --> 33:26.120
Yeah, I think we just
go up there, and we--

33:26.160 --> 33:27.680
we get him out
of the fuckin' house,

33:27.680 --> 33:29.760
and I take a pop and--

33:29.760 --> 33:31.720
Gonna fucking shoot him?

33:32.760 --> 33:36.160
Anyone who's got any better
ideas, I'd love to hear 'em.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.800
And what will you--
How we gonna get him out?

33:37.800 --> 33:39.920
You can say, "Please come out,
I'm gonna shoot you."

33:39.960 --> 33:41.720
I don't know.
You tell me.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.360
Just say to him
we want the gig.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.920
Offer him some money to--

33:44.920 --> 33:46.840
I think just knock on
the door, get him out,

33:46.840 --> 33:49.080
and I just take a pop.
It's that simple.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.320
Serious shit, Sonny.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.280
What are we gonna do?
What can we do?

33:53.280 --> 33:54.560
Just warn him or something.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.120
[Sonny]
He ain't goin' away.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.840
He's gotta get done.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.160
I fucking can't
believe this, man.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.960
[clears throat]
I can.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.840
I been awake a bit
too long, I think.

34:05.880 --> 34:09.000
Got any-- Sandwiches'd help,
John. Like, food and-- Yeah.

34:09.000 --> 34:09.280
Yeah.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.640
Help yourself
down at the bar.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.080
[muttering]

34:12.120 --> 34:14.560
[John]
Bring some up, will you?

34:22.280 --> 34:23.960
You know I'm
with you, Sonny.

34:23.960 --> 34:24.680
All the way.

34:24.680 --> 34:26.600
You know that.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.240
It's fucked up.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.480
Oh, for fuck's sake,
let's do something.

34:53.480 --> 34:54.720
I'm gonna go
fucking stir-crazy.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.440
Man, come on,
something, anything.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.040
Cards. Come on.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.840
Sonny, game of cards?

35:02.240 --> 35:04.680
[Sonny]
Sorted. Come on, John.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.120
Yeah, why not, eh?

35:06.120 --> 35:07.920
Might as well
find us some jelly.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.400
Seems like shit-all
for dinner.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.240
[shouting]
Sonny!

35:20.280 --> 35:22.040
Come here!

35:22.040 --> 35:27.400
It's-- It's Timbo, man.
[continues, indistinct]

35:30.840 --> 35:32.760
Oh!

35:34.280 --> 35:36.200
[shouting]

35:50.160 --> 35:52.080
Oh, God.

35:57.640 --> 36:02.040
[sobbing, inarticulate]

36:09.640 --> 36:11.640
Take care of the latch.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.600
Take care of the latch!
I'm doin' it.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.320
Good luck, man.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.560
All right, man.
[car door slams]

39:26.360 --> 39:28.360
Oof!

39:28.360 --> 39:29.480
Hello,

39:29.480 --> 39:31.800
He's got an ax!
A fucking ax!

39:31.840 --> 39:33.080
We're sortin'

39:33.080 --> 39:34.200
I'll say when
it's sorted.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.800
We can--we can
sort this out.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.240
We just need
to talk about it.

39:37.240 --> 39:38.600
You've got some guts
coming to my door

39:38.640 --> 39:39.160
in that shape.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.320
I've got money

39:40.320 --> 39:41.920
Sonny, fucking

39:41.920 --> 39:43.600
Fucking nail him.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.800
I'm gonna take
your fat belly

39:44.800 --> 39:46.560
and I'm gonna rub it
in the fucking mud, you gack!

39:46.560 --> 39:48.480

39:50.760 --> 39:52.400
You shot fucking Al!

39:52.400 --> 39:53.680
What the fuck?

39:53.720 --> 39:55.080
You fucking

39:55.120 --> 39:57.040
Drive!
Al!

39:57.520 --> 39:58.480
[Herbie]
Okay, now.

Fuck this whole thing!
You shot him--

40:09.280 --> 40:12.640
[indistinct dialogue]

40:15.680 --> 40:17.600
Alan! Alan!

40:43.480 --> 40:45.760
Go on, suck it,
suck it, suck it.

40:45.760 --> 40:48.360
[guys cheering]

40:50.400 --> 40:52.320
[Man]
How you feeling?

40:57.840 --> 41:00.320
You can't be sick
off that hit.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.560
I'll sit with him.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.000
[indistinct dialogue]

41:11.000 --> 41:13.080
Make him stand up.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.720
He needs to get up.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.920
Let's see
if he stays, okay?

41:40.600 --> 41:41.520
[sobbing]
The fucking gear box

41:41.520 --> 41:41.920
is gone, man.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.760
We're fucked.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.000
We're fucking
stranded here, man.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.520
We're gonna have to
walk back into town,

41:47.520 --> 41:47.920
aren't we?

41:47.920 --> 41:50.400
What are you talking about, man?
He's waiting for us.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.480
He's gonna fucking
kill us, man.

41:51.480 --> 41:52.720
Well, where are you
gonna go, man?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.160
There.
Where?

41:54.160 --> 41:56.760
Fucking there, anywhere.
I don't care, man.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.880
That's off in the fucking
middle of fucking nowhere.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.400
We're in the middle
of nowhere with him.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.200
Fucking--

42:03.240 --> 42:05.160
You shot Al, man!

42:06.480 --> 42:07.560
It was an accident.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.120
[Tuff]
You saw him, Herbie!

42:09.120 --> 42:11.960
You saw it!

42:11.960 --> 42:14.360
He'll be calling
the police, man.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.720
Herb, come on, man.

42:18.040 --> 42:20.160
Herb, fucking
go with me.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.000
We're better off
in town, man.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.440
Soz, man, come on.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.520
Let's fuck off.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.200
Tuff, man, what am I
gonna do out there?

42:27.200 --> 42:29.480
I might as well be walking
off the edge of a cliff.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.000
Fucking come on!

42:31.000 --> 42:32.960
Tuff, get a grip,
will ya?

42:33.000 --> 42:34.400
Come back
to town with us.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.880
We're all gonna
fucking die with him!

42:35.880 --> 42:38.880
You...fuck off!

42:38.880 --> 42:41.680
You're gonna
fucking die!

42:41.680 --> 42:44.760
Tuff!

43:02.840 --> 43:04.520
Do you remember when
you came to our school

43:04.520 --> 43:06.640
and did that run, Richard?

43:11.880 --> 43:13.240
I do, yeah.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.040
Good day that was,
wasn't it?

43:15.040 --> 43:16.400
Mm.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.640
You was the best.

43:17.640 --> 43:20.400
You made the most money,
didn't ya?

43:20.880 --> 43:22.120
About 300 quid, I think.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.080
[whistles]

43:25.360 --> 43:27.600
Do you remember
when you played football?

43:27.600 --> 43:28.880
I do, yeah.

43:28.880 --> 43:32.200
You was the best then
as well, weren't ya?

43:32.200 --> 43:33.480
Who was that little lad

43:33.480 --> 43:35.320
that kept showing his arse
whenever he got the ball?

43:35.320 --> 43:40.160
That's Michael.
Michael Parks.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.760
They tried to hold me hand,
didn't they, mate?

43:42.760 --> 43:46.000
Yeah, didn't they?
They all held your hand.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.920
I didn't.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.520
I know you didn't.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.400
Don't need to, do I?

45:12.680 --> 45:14.600
[Sonny sighs]

45:19.640 --> 45:23.280
Now we should check
this place out.

45:23.280 --> 45:25.480
Make sure
no one's in there.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.200
Fuckin' hell,
mate.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.680
[sniffs]

45:42.080 --> 45:44.000
Here you are, mate.

45:47.160 --> 45:48.440
Sonny, have you
got one bigger, man?

45:48.440 --> 45:50.240
Huh?
Got something bigger?

45:50.240 --> 45:51.920
That's the whole
point, though.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.200
The thing is with this little
fucking thing, these aren't--

45:54.240 --> 45:55.600
You can't see.
You got it?

45:55.600 --> 45:57.880
You know what I mean?
You just put it here.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.040
Just fucking
got it here.

45:59.040 --> 46:00.400
And you just--

46:00.400 --> 46:02.120
No fucking nasty cut,
you know what I mean?

46:02.120 --> 46:05.400
It's proper
army edition there.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.680
[strings crossbow]
We'll have

46:06.680 --> 46:07.360
a look up here.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.680
He's in the fucking
army now, innit?

46:08.680 --> 46:10.440
Huh?
He's in the

46:10.440 --> 46:11.920
fucking army.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.840
Yeah.

46:16.760 --> 46:19.640
[muffled breathing]

46:31.360 --> 46:33.480
All right in here, mate.

47:12.400 --> 47:15.360
Sonny?

47:15.360 --> 47:16.880
What's wrong, mate?

47:16.880 --> 47:18.920
Here's not in here, mate.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.040
There's nothing there.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.440
[Herbie]
Are you sure, man?

47:22.480 --> 47:23.760
[exhales loudly]

47:23.760 --> 47:26.600
There?

47:26.600 --> 47:28.600
What's going on?
Hmm.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.680
[Sonny yawns]

47:34.680 --> 47:37.080
Fucking Tuff, man.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.280
What's he run off for?
What a fool.

47:40.320 --> 47:41.720
Do you actually think
he's coming to town?

47:41.720 --> 47:42.840
[Soz]
Yeah, I bet

47:42.840 --> 47:44.280
he turns up in a bit.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.400
Shouldn't have fucking
left him, should we?

47:46.440 --> 47:47.800
[Herbie]
He's a fucking lazy bastard.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.840
He wouldn't walk
that far, now would he?

47:49.840 --> 47:51.080
Do you want some
in there, Gage?

47:51.080 --> 47:54.200
Just put some
in there, yeah.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.840
Just up to the line.
You see that line.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.800
To the line--Stop!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:57.840 --> 47:59.760
Yeah.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.440
Ohh...

48:16.480 --> 48:18.400
Okay now.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.200
I can't me head around it.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.960
[squirting sound,
groaning]

48:50.960 --> 48:52.440
The soldier here
is fucking rank, man.

48:52.440 --> 48:54.600
That's disgusting.
I could taste that.

48:54.600 --> 48:57.760
Fucking hell. I can
taste it in me beer.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.560
I still don't feel well
after sitting here.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.160
I'm not fucking going
downstairs on me own.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.440
Got any more
pots for washing?

49:04.440 --> 49:06.560
Here. Put that in.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.200
Right, that's
the recyclin'.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.200
Put them up
for tomorrow.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.600
You may wanna keep
things like this.

49:15.640 --> 49:17.200
Want all of this
to go in the washing?

49:17.240 --> 49:19.280
That's a washing.
They're clean.

49:19.320 --> 49:20.440
They're not
smelly, mate.

49:20.440 --> 49:22.360
Oh, no.
That one stinks.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.600
If I can only
savor this one...

49:24.640 --> 49:26.080
You could if you want.

49:26.080 --> 49:27.280
When your friends
were pot leavers

49:27.280 --> 49:28.480
and you kept half
the things like that,

49:28.480 --> 49:30.040
there could be
a corkscrew there.

49:30.040 --> 49:30.280
What?

49:30.280 --> 49:32.080
You drink those
from the pint.

49:32.080 --> 49:33.120
Well, isn't it
for lager?

49:33.120 --> 49:35.560
Ahh. For lager.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.360
I used to do this
all the time, you know.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.680
Not much lift
in their bollocks.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.600
We'll turn 'em up.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.760
...you behemoth.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.320
[both grunting]

49:47.320 --> 49:49.240
Come on.

49:49.840 --> 49:52.920
Now, if you get the plastic,
you see, the plastic's 5--

49:52.920 --> 49:57.560
3 pence, and the glass
is 5 pence,

49:57.560 --> 49:59.680
so if you put the 3
to the 5, you lose

49:59.680 --> 50:00.480
fuckin' money.

50:00.480 --> 50:03.600
You gotta put the 5's
and the 3's separate.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.200
So remember,
the glass is 5.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.840
Have you fed
these fish?

50:09.840 --> 50:11.600
I fed them
this morning.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.120
Yeah?
Yeah.

50:13.160 --> 50:15.120
Does my face
look all right?

50:15.120 --> 50:16.200
I don't feel good, man.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.960
Huh?
Take it off of me, man.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.840
I don't need it.
Take it off of me.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.600
Take it off of me.
I don't feel good.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.120
Take it off.
I don't want it.

50:23.160 --> 50:24.520
Hang on.
I'm done.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.600
I'm outta here.

50:25.600 --> 50:28.160
Sonny, what does
my face look like?

50:28.160 --> 50:31.840
Feels like--loose.
Is it blotchy or something?

50:34.880 --> 50:37.080
That's a bit red,
this eye.

50:37.120 --> 50:40.800
I'd go and get that eye
checked if I were you.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.680
Have you fed the fish?

50:42.680 --> 50:44.480
I fed them
this morning, man.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.880
One of 'em looks
like a shark.

51:25.200 --> 51:28.440
[echoing, unintelligible]

51:50.680 --> 51:52.600
Raaah!

52:02.880 --> 52:08.840
<i>♪ Sunny sunny sunny
days with you ♪</i>

52:08.840 --> 52:14.040
<i>♪ Sunny sunny sunny
days with you ♪</i>

52:15.160 --> 52:18.480
Help. Help me.

52:37.080 --> 52:38.600
You're the devil.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.520
I wish I fucking was.

52:41.760 --> 52:45.120
Jesus.
No.

52:45.120 --> 52:47.160
You a devil?

52:50.520 --> 52:52.440
Jesus.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.400
Don't--
Don't touch me.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.640
Do you like to party?

53:00.640 --> 53:02.240
Get up and fucking dance.

53:02.240 --> 53:04.640
Get up and dance
at my party.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.000
Get your fat up.
Look at ya!

53:06.000 --> 53:10.920
[overlapping, echoing]

53:10.920 --> 53:14.480
Come on. Come on!

53:14.480 --> 53:15.920
Have a dance.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.840
[laughing]

53:24.080 --> 53:26.000
[spitting]

53:27.920 --> 53:30.600
He doesn't know.
He's just trying.

53:30.600 --> 53:32.440
With a mind that's
fucked up for ages.

53:32.480 --> 53:33.720
[screaming]

53:33.760 --> 53:35.240
[gasping]

53:35.240 --> 53:38.440
<i>Did you think you could
get away with it?</i>

53:38.440 --> 53:40.560
<i>You fuckin' did, man.</i>

53:42.560 --> 53:43.880
<i>You can come with me.</i>

53:43.920 --> 53:45.800
Help.

54:26.800 --> 54:29.000
Up. Sit up!

54:29.000 --> 54:31.280
Fucking chin up.
Sit up, man.

54:33.200 --> 54:35.120
Pay attention.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.600
Up on your feet, you.

54:42.960 --> 54:45.920
Whoa. Don't you know
who I am?

54:48.360 --> 54:49.480
Can I go?

54:49.480 --> 54:52.920
Well, you're going.
You're going.

54:55.480 --> 54:58.120
Are you going?
No.

54:58.160 --> 55:00.680
I'm gonna do it all
for you now.

55:03.200 --> 55:06.360
I'm gonna take it
all away from you.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.480
You just look at me
like that. That's it, mate.

55:08.480 --> 55:12.240
That's it. You just stand
there and don't move.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.920
I gotta fucki''
shut you off.

55:19.360 --> 55:21.280
[glass shattering]

55:28.320 --> 55:30.240
[glass breaking]

55:31.440 --> 55:33.360
Hey.

55:34.440 --> 55:36.680
Sit there.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.800
There's something
I want to show you.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.120
It's just
between me and you.

55:42.320 --> 55:44.240
Just stay there.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.720
Wipe your nose.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.680
[sniffling]

56:18.040 --> 56:19.960
Open it.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.360
Open it.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.760
What is it?

56:27.520 --> 56:29.440
Open it.

56:44.560 --> 56:46.640
[sighs]

56:51.080 --> 56:53.000
Who is he?

56:53.440 --> 56:55.360
That's not Joe.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.640
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

57:01.240 --> 57:03.680
Do you want
to give him a kiss?

57:04.440 --> 57:06.360
No.

57:08.200 --> 57:11.680
Say something to him.
It's your last chance.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.920
Are you frightened?

57:17.440 --> 57:18.600
Want me to close it?

57:18.600 --> 57:20.920
I'm sorry, mate.

57:20.920 --> 57:25.480
Yeah. It's hard losing
somebody close to you,

57:25.520 --> 57:26.440
isn't it?

57:26.440 --> 57:28.280
[sobbing]

57:28.280 --> 57:29.320
Do you want me
to show it to you?

57:29.320 --> 57:31.800
Yeah...
Yeah.

57:31.800 --> 57:33.720
What did you do that for?

57:33.720 --> 57:35.640
He tried to run away.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.280
Do you know
why you're alive?

57:43.320 --> 57:45.200
You're a good man.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.200
Yeah.

57:46.200 --> 57:48.120
Yeah.
Yeah.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.920
I'll give you a deal.
You tell me

57:52.960 --> 57:53.960
what I want to know,

57:54.000 --> 57:55.160
and I'll let you live.

57:55.160 --> 57:57.080
Will you?
Mm-hmm.

57:57.880 --> 57:59.800
There's one more.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.600
Where is he?

58:06.600 --> 58:08.920
Where he lives?

58:08.920 --> 58:11.160
No.

58:11.160 --> 58:14.280
Fuckin' hell.

58:14.280 --> 58:16.240
That's them.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.720
That's them in there.
Where's you?

58:18.720 --> 58:19.760
Where are you?

58:19.760 --> 58:21.040
I'm here.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.800
Yeah.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.280
You're here.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.160
Tell me I can go.

58:27.160 --> 58:28.840
What would you have said?
I'll help ya.

58:28.840 --> 58:31.440
Well, then...

58:31.440 --> 58:32.800
I've gone all straight.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.640
That don't matter.

58:34.680 --> 58:36.880
West End.

58:39.600 --> 58:43.400
You fuckin' lying to me?
No.

58:43.400 --> 58:44.880
I'll come after ya.

58:44.880 --> 58:47.560
Aye. I know it's West End.

58:47.560 --> 58:50.680
You know I'll come
after you, don't ya?

58:53.000 --> 58:56.800
That's why I know you're
telling the truth.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.360
You'll let me live,
won't you now?

58:59.360 --> 59:00.880
I promised you.
You did, didn't ya?

59:00.880 --> 59:02.480
Yeah.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.720
And I don't go back
on my word, mate.

59:04.720 --> 59:06.800
Honest?
Mm.

59:06.840 --> 59:08.760
Put it there.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.080
Eh?
Yeah.

59:14.760 --> 59:16.680
Not this time, pal.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.960
[chuckles]
[sobbing]

59:20.000 --> 59:22.880
That's it, mate.
Let it out.

59:22.920 --> 59:24.960
Let it all out.
That's it.

59:33.760 --> 59:36.480
Is that for me?

59:36.480 --> 59:38.520
No.

59:38.520 --> 59:39.560
Tell the truth.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.600
No.

59:41.600 --> 59:43.560
It don't matter
anyway, does it?

59:43.560 --> 59:44.560
Does it, now?

59:44.600 --> 59:46.840
Well, no, not now.

59:46.840 --> 59:48.160
I wouldn't have done that.

59:48.160 --> 59:49.520
Oh, no, mate.

59:49.560 --> 59:51.960
Fuck it.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.760
Come here.

59:53.760 --> 59:55.840

Yeah.

1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:16.120
Here now.

1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:19.720
I told you an hour.
Where have you been?

1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:21.240
The park.
What's that?

1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:22.480
A mask.

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.920
Take it off.

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:28.120
What are you doing
with that on?

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:29.720
Where'd you get that from?

1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:30.720
A soldier.

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:32.480
What?
A soldier.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:34.520
What is that?
A knife.

1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:37.000
I know it's a knife.
What you doing with a knife?

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:38.040
Soldier gave us them.

1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:39.400
What do you mean,
a soldier gave it to you?

1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:40.760
He said he knew Dad.

1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:42.240
He said he knew Dad, did he?

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:44.480
Really?

1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:46.480
Mark!

1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:47.920
Mark!
[Mark] What?

1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:49.840
Come down here now!

1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:01.200
[Mark] Come on. We're gonna
drive down there now.

1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:03.760
Definitely not
trash diving, is it?

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:04.720
[Boys] No.

if you see him?

1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:12.280
[Boy] Yeah.

1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:36.840
Hi. Can I help ya?

1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:38.480
Hello, love.
Is Mark available?

1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:40.600
No, he's just gone out
with the lads, actually.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:41.680
Oh, that's a shame.

1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:42.600
Can I tell him
who's calling?

1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:43.600
Yeah, my name's Richard.

1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:45.560
I'm an old friend of his
from years ago.

1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:47.520
Was you in the park
this morning?

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:48.480
Yeah, yeah.

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:49.560
Did you meet my lads?

1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:52.520
I did.
Absolutely brilliant lads.

1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:53.920
Yeah.
Crackers.

1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:55.080
They are crackers.

1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:56.760
Yeah, they've been
shouted at today.

1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:58.080
Oh, right.

1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.680
Yeah, 'cause they
came back with a mask

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:00.160
and a knife.

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:01.480
So I was a bit upset,
to be honest.

1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:02.840
It was blunt.

1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:04.480
I know, but it's a bit
irresponsible, isn't it?

1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:06.480
I was really worried.

1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:09.240
You're a good mother.

1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:10.880
Yeah.

1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:12.760
Yeah, I am
a good mother.

1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:14.680
Good one, then.

1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:17.800
Sorry. Can I ask your
name again?

1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:19.200
My name's Richard.

1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:22.080
And...just tell him
that you called, yeah?

1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:24.640
Yeah. I'll be around anyway.

1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:25.480
Right, okay.

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:26.440
Anthony's brother.

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.760
Anthony's brother,
right.

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:30.720
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:56.360
What are you doing
sittin' there in

1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:56.680

1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:58.320
I'm waiting for you lot.

1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:00.120
How you doing, lads?
All right.

1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:03.160
You gonna go upstairs and play
on your computer before tea?

1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:05.080
Okay.

1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:09.520
There's no one up there.

1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:10.880
No, that's 'cause
he's been here.

1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:12.720
He what? Do you mean
he's been here?

1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:15.280
No, as soon as you left,
he came.

1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:16.360
What? Been inside?

1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:17.440
No, he didn't come inside.

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:19.800
He was fine.
He wasn't--he wasn't...

1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:20.960
It was a bit weird.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.680
What'd he say?

1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:25.040
He said, "Tell him
Richard called."

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:26.120
And you don't know him?

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:28.360
No, I've never seen him
before in me life.

1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:30.120
Never.

1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:31.600
But he did ask for you.

1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:32.880
He said, uh,

1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:36.400
"He used to knock about with
his brother years ago: Anthony."

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:38.920
[echoing]
Leave him alone.

1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:42.360
What?

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.280
Hey, soft, man.

1:05:44.760 --> 1:05:46.680
What is it, babe?

1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:51.120
What's wrong?

1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:52.080
I do know him.

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:53.920
Get off! Get off!

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:56.200
I know who he is.

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:00.240
Anthony.

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:08.680
He was just a kid,
just a...young lad.

1:06:08.680 --> 1:06:11.760
I mean, he was a simple kid.
He wasn't...

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:13.200
Do you know what I mean?
He wasn't as--

1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:14.840
He was just...

1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:17.560
too simple to know
what he was doing.

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:19.800
Until Rich
went in the army.

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.680
And Anthony used
to hang about with us, like...

1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:26.800
We just had a laugh with him,
we had a laugh with him.

1:06:26.800 --> 1:06:28.840
But Sonny was just...

1:06:28.840 --> 1:06:31.480
just everything.
Everything was too far.

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.120
Everything he took too far.

1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:36.280
And Anthony just didn't know
what was happening.

1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:38.400
He didn't know where he was.
He was-- He wasn't like--

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:41.080
He just didn't
understand at all.

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.200
He just--just...

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:45.640
He didn't understand
any of it.

1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:48.080
We...

1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:50.440
all got in a van and...

1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:52.720
we were dropping acid and...

1:06:54.920 --> 1:06:57.040
And Sonny gave him some...

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:00.800
And I could see
it was going wrong.

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:03.560
I could see-- I could see
Anthony's face,

1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:04.760
and it was all...

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:08.120
He was tripping
out of his mind, this kid.

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:32.520
Anthony, stop shouting.

1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:36.080
Because every time you shout,
your mother gets sick.

1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:39.920
And then Richard might
get a bullet in the army.

1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:42.280
And we don't
want that, do we?

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:56.320
Move from there,
you're dead.

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:59.080
Don't fuckin' move!

Come on!
Get a move on!

1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:14.760
[Mark] I was the last one--
I could have stayed.

1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:16.400
I could have stayed.
I could have kept with him.

1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:19.080
But everybody got
back in the van.

1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:23.400
Left him.

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.840
I didn't want to leave him.

1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:57.920

He's killed himself.
He's done himself.

1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:20.600

1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:23.400
Don't make a noise.

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:25.360
Get up.

1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:43.360
Where are your
car keys?

1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.240

I'll push this

1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:12.680
Here.

1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:25.400
Do you remember me?

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.720
Yeah.

1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:33.960
Why have I brought you here?

1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:40.920
This is where
Anthony was--

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:42.840
Was?

1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:46.320
When he what?

1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:53.840
Come on, have the bollocks
to say it.

1:14:55.640 --> 1:14:57.680
Where he hung himself.

1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:01.320
Why him?

1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:03.760
'Cause he was weak.

1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:08.760
'Cause he was a spastic.

1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:10.960
He wasn't a spastic.

1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:14.120
He fuckin' was a spastic.

1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:19.520
[imitating Anthony's speech]

1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:21.440
He was a fuckin' nana.

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:25.120
He looked up to you.

1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:28.560
Well, he was a fuckin'
embarrassment to me.

1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:35.600
What did you do to him?

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:40.280
What did you do?

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:47.000
We were--
I said you!

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.200
What did you fuckin' do?
Not them cocks.

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.920
I didn't stop it.

1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:00.400
I didn't stop it.

1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:04.280
Well, I wish you had...

1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:08.040
'cause you could have stopped
a lot of carnage.

1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:11.560
What do you mean?

1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:13.480
They're all fuckin' dead.

1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:15.920
I executed them.

1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:18.600
And you're the last one.

1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:26.840
Now I'm the monster.

1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:38.200
Was he calling for me?

1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:42.280
When you were torturing him,
was he calling for me?

1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:46.560
Yeah.

1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:52.760
Was he screaming my name?

1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:58.520
Yeah, he was.

1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:02.240
He still is.

1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:23.360
I love you, Anthony.

1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:29.640
I love you, kid,
but I can't do him.

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.520
I can't do him.

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:35.040
I'm sorry.

1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:46.400
Take this from me.

1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:53.000
No.
You take it.

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.360
No. I don't want it.

1:17:55.360 --> 1:17:56.680
If you don't take this
knife from me,

1:17:56.680 --> 1:17:57.960
I'm gonna do something
awful with it.

1:17:57.960 --> 1:17:59.880
Take it.

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.800
Take it.

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.160
Take it.

1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:23.440
You...

1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:26.000

to be a monster.

There's blood on my hands.

1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:43.400
Look what you made me do.

1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:45.400
No. No.

1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:47.640
Come on.

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:49.320
Stick that knife in me.

1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:52.480
No. I can't.

1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:56.640
Please. I don't know what else
I'm capable of doing.

1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:00.200
