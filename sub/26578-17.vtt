00:02.313 --> 00:04.537
Eddie, you got something
from a novelty company?

00:04.562 --> 00:05.889
Ooh! My X-ray specs.

00:05.914 --> 00:07.960
I hurt my hand. I just want
to make sure it isn't broken.

00:08.016 --> 00:10.237
Anything for me from
the Super Sugar Crisp people?

00:10.262 --> 00:12.865
No, just a postcard from Tony the Tiger.

00:12.899 --> 00:15.668
He says he's grrrrravely ill.

00:15.701 --> 00:16.902
Gonna guess diabetes.

00:16.935 --> 00:18.303
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

00:18.336 --> 00:21.173
A million kids sent in
a box-top for that contest.

00:21.207 --> 00:22.675
You also had to write an essay...

00:22.708 --> 00:25.044
"Why I Deserve To Appear
On 'The Partridge Family'."

00:25.077 --> 00:27.246
I spent the first 19 pages
crapping on "The Brady Bunch."

00:27.280 --> 00:28.548
No love lost there.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.050
It's "Munsters" versus
"Addams Family" all over again.

00:31.083 --> 00:32.752
But you <i> like</i> "The Brady Bunch."

00:32.785 --> 00:34.821
And if <i> they</i> have a contest, I'll
crap on "The Partridge Family."

00:34.853 --> 00:37.689
It's called show <i> business,</i>
not show <i> friendship.</i>

00:37.722 --> 00:39.491
It's all covered in my essay.

00:39.524 --> 00:41.193
Don't expect rock 'n' rollers
like the Partridges

00:41.226 --> 00:43.028
to get back to you in a timely fashion.

00:43.061 --> 00:44.563
"Come On Get Happy!"

00:44.597 --> 00:46.399
We all know how they get happy.

00:46.432 --> 00:47.901
- Marijuana cigarettes.
- I got it.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.434
Your father and I are leaving.

00:49.468 --> 00:52.238
But, don't worry. It's not
the big one yet. We'll be back.

00:52.271 --> 00:54.173
- William, keep an eye on the baby.
- Right-ee-o.

00:54.206 --> 00:55.508
I'm taking your mother
for her driving test,

00:55.540 --> 00:56.909
so stay off the streets and sidewalks.

00:56.942 --> 00:58.844
In fact, just to be safe,

00:58.877 --> 01:00.213
you might want to hide indoors.

01:01.546 --> 01:03.415
I rehearsed the
"streets and sidewalk" part.

01:03.448 --> 01:06.285
The... The "hide indoors,"
that... that just hit me.

01:06.318 --> 01:08.186
The way Mom would with a car.

01:08.220 --> 01:09.622
With these on, I can look through walls

01:09.654 --> 01:10.923
and see if she's coming.

01:12.291 --> 01:13.559
Did you see <i> that</i> coming?

01:13.592 --> 01:14.794
All my boys are so funny.

01:14.827 --> 01:16.095
Look out, Bob Hope!

01:16.128 --> 01:17.897
Why? Are you driving near <i> his</i> house?

01:17.929 --> 01:19.631
Knock it off!

01:19.664 --> 01:20.967
It's rude to joke about

01:21.000 --> 01:23.069
the very real danger of Mom's driving.

01:23.101 --> 01:24.704
It's not worth the risk, Mom.

01:24.737 --> 01:26.372
I want us to grow old together.

01:26.404 --> 01:27.806
Suddenly, a trip through the windshield

01:27.839 --> 01:29.008
doesn't sound so bad.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.187

01:32.478 --> 01:33.946
<i>Weeks had passed since I'd entered</i>

01:33.979 --> 01:35.448
<i>the "Partridge Family" contest.</i>

01:35.481 --> 01:37.216
<i>I started to accept reality...</i>

01:37.249 --> 01:39.051
<i>my essay obviously got lost in the mail.</i>

01:39.085 --> 01:41.321
<i>I decided to deliver it myself.</i>

01:41.354 --> 01:43.957
Hey, chief.
Working hard or hardly working?

01:43.990 --> 01:45.324
- How's the wife?
- Mean as a snake.

01:45.357 --> 01:46.625
Wait a second!

01:46.658 --> 01:49.127
You're not someone I share
cheap shots at my wife with.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.996
What are you trying to pull?

01:51.029 --> 01:52.440
I just have to go drop something off

01:52.465 --> 01:53.947
at the "Partridge Family" offices.

01:53.972 --> 01:56.008
And are the "Partridge" people
expecting you?

01:56.041 --> 01:57.609
I'm exactly what they're <i> not</i> expecting,

01:57.642 --> 01:58.844
and that's what makes me pop.

01:58.877 --> 02:00.312
Oh, pop? Don't pop.

02:00.345 --> 02:02.247
That's not how we do things around here.

02:02.279 --> 02:05.918
It's called show <i> business,</i>
not show <i> surprises!</i>

02:05.951 --> 02:08.287
Eh, "Partridge" auditions are <i> next</i> week.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.988
No, I'm here for
the Super Sugar Crisp contest.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.523
Oh, that's over.

02:11.555 --> 02:13.758
They hired some kid with a plate
in his head for the publicity.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.160
Nice kid, though.

02:15.192 --> 02:17.161
He let us throw
refrigerator magnets at him.

02:17.195 --> 02:19.298
Wait, you said something
about another audition?

02:19.330 --> 02:20.798
They're replacing one of the kids.

02:20.832 --> 02:23.035
And word on the fake New York street is

02:23.067 --> 02:25.970
they're replacing
Danny Bonaduce, "The Duce."

02:26.003 --> 02:27.371
"The Duce"?

02:27.405 --> 02:29.541
Oh, that's what we're contractually
required to call him.

02:29.573 --> 02:32.143
But I believe they've had enough
of his reign of terror!

02:32.177 --> 02:34.213
You know, that guy
once threw apple juice at me.

02:34.245 --> 02:36.147
Throwing apple juice?

02:36.180 --> 02:38.017
I've got to get into this audition!

02:42.519 --> 02:44.155
Oof!

02:44.189 --> 02:46.157
Really drilled that squirrel.

02:46.191 --> 02:49.027
It's actually safer
than swerving to avoid them.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.295
You're doing quite well.

02:50.328 --> 02:52.130
Tell that to my husband.

02:52.162 --> 02:54.499
He's very ignorant
when it comes to women drivers.

02:54.531 --> 02:56.567
We all know the real problem
is these "guests"

02:56.601 --> 02:58.303
from other countries.

02:58.335 --> 03:01.639
Last vehicle they drove
was a yak or a magic carpet.

03:01.673 --> 03:03.542
O... kay.

03:03.574 --> 03:06.043
Uh, so, now make a left here.

03:06.077 --> 03:07.312
Oh, no, thank you, Ron.

03:07.345 --> 03:08.680
You just tell me where you want to go,

03:08.713 --> 03:09.915
I'll get you there some other way.

03:09.947 --> 03:11.437
Oh, left turns are part of the test.

03:12.784 --> 03:15.958
Stop at the intersection
and then proceed when safe.

03:19.624 --> 03:21.126
"When safe."

03:22.560 --> 03:24.016
You know what's safe, Ron?

03:24.041 --> 03:25.133
Going right.

03:25.158 --> 03:26.794
Go now, 'cause it's yellow.

03:26.826 --> 03:28.562
Yellow means danger.
We're just gonna go straight.

03:28.594 --> 03:31.564
Oh! Okay.

03:31.598 --> 03:33.801
That was a big failure back there.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.402
Fine, fine. Just take
a couple points off.

03:35.434 --> 03:36.903
Then we can drive around,
I'll hit a few squirrels,

03:36.937 --> 03:38.539
and we'll push that grade back up.

03:40.106 --> 03:41.808
I'm a shoo-in to be the new Danny.

03:41.842 --> 03:44.845
I mean, I've got the talent,
plus the red hair.

03:44.878 --> 03:46.446
Plus, I've built relationships
on the show. Look.

03:46.479 --> 03:47.814
"Love, Susan Dey."

03:47.848 --> 03:49.817
Yeah. It's her real name... intimate.

03:49.849 --> 03:51.150
Won't that be weird for you

03:51.183 --> 03:52.485
when you have to play
brother and sister?

03:52.519 --> 03:54.420
Okay. I think we're both professionals.

03:54.454 --> 03:56.123
Hold my Clackers.

03:56.156 --> 03:57.957
I'm going outside
to play on the monkey bars.

03:57.991 --> 04:00.260
I hope the monkeys show up this time.

04:00.293 --> 04:02.096
Pat has clacked himself in the head

04:02.128 --> 04:03.985
one too many times.

04:04.531 --> 04:05.780
Is that Laurie Partridge?

04:05.805 --> 04:07.001
Do you know her?

04:07.033 --> 04:08.835
They have an ongoing
intimate correspondence.

04:08.868 --> 04:11.138
And it looks like
I may be joining the show.

04:11.170 --> 04:13.106
- On television?
- We're not talking dinner theater.

04:13.140 --> 04:14.108
Jinkies!

04:14.140 --> 04:16.276
What is David Cassidy really like?

04:16.309 --> 04:18.011
Describe him slowly,
starting with his lips.

04:18.045 --> 04:19.680
They're good people over there.

04:19.713 --> 04:21.314
You know, a set becomes like a family.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.182
<i>Though I hadn't even
scheduled an audition yet,</i>

04:23.216 --> 04:25.718
<i>I decided to get some early buzz going.</i>

04:25.752 --> 04:27.221
<i>Joey also saw an opportunity.</i>

04:27.254 --> 04:29.123
Anybody wanna pay 3 bucks

04:29.156 --> 04:31.792
for this rare, one-of-a-kind picture?

04:31.824 --> 04:33.526
I'll buy it for $2.

04:33.559 --> 04:35.396
It's called show <i> business,</i>
not show <i> discount,</i> sweetie.

04:35.429 --> 04:36.563
Who's got three simoleons?

04:36.596 --> 04:38.232
I'll take it.

04:38.264 --> 04:39.632
Thank you.

04:39.665 --> 04:41.168
Could you sign my Pee Chee folder?

04:41.201 --> 04:44.371
I also have Chris Partridge's Clackers,

04:44.403 --> 04:46.372
as seen in an episode.

04:46.406 --> 04:48.036
I loved that episode!

04:48.542 --> 04:49.843
What's your name?

04:49.875 --> 04:51.477
<i>Danny, how about it, huh?</i>

04:51.511 --> 04:52.980
<i>You ready to rehearse with us or not?</i>

04:53.012 --> 04:54.247
<i>Oh, sure, Keith.</i>

04:54.281 --> 04:56.483
<i>I'm really ready to rehearse the music.</i>

04:56.516 --> 04:58.318
I should learn how to play
the bass for my audition.

04:58.350 --> 04:59.952
I could give you some pointers.

04:59.985 --> 05:02.723
It's gonna be tough replacing
an icon like Danny Bonaduce.

05:02.756 --> 05:04.558
When they see <i> my</i> interpretation
of the role,

05:04.591 --> 05:07.028
they'll be calling him
Danny Bona-who?-chee.

05:08.394 --> 05:10.264
You better hope that show has writers.

05:10.297 --> 05:12.499
That Ron character
was completely unreasonable.

05:12.531 --> 05:14.100
What's so important about left turns?

05:14.134 --> 05:16.937
Well, as far as turns go,
it's one of The Big Two.

05:16.970 --> 05:19.039
Failing a test is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

05:19.071 --> 05:20.773
<i>I</i> fail at stuff all the time

05:20.807 --> 05:22.443
and still feel good about myself.

05:22.475 --> 05:24.577
- Well, you shouldn't.
- I made it clear.

05:24.610 --> 05:26.446
I simply wanted
a "no left turn" license,

05:26.480 --> 05:27.713
like all the celebrities have.

05:27.747 --> 05:29.383
I don't think that's a real thing.

05:29.415 --> 05:32.752
They have special licenses...
for taxicabs and tractors.

05:32.785 --> 05:34.387
That Oscar Mayer Wienermobile...

05:34.420 --> 05:35.889
no one's making a left in the wiener.

05:35.922 --> 05:37.257
I'm on your side, Mom.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.958
It's totally unfair to expect a woman

05:38.992 --> 05:40.861
to have the same ability
with machines as a man.

05:40.894 --> 05:42.129
That's just science.

05:42.161 --> 05:43.596
Mom's good with <i> lots</i> of machines,

05:43.629 --> 05:45.298
like the washing machine and the stove.

05:45.331 --> 05:48.534
Yeah, but those don't
put people's lives in peril.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.370
There <i> was</i> that time
she served us those clams

05:50.403 --> 05:52.406
she scraped off the posts from
under the Santa Monica Pier.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.607
We all knew going in

05:53.639 --> 05:55.442
free shellfish was not without risk.

05:55.475 --> 05:56.944
There was nothing wrong
with those clams.

05:56.976 --> 05:58.544
You kids brought
something home from school.

05:58.578 --> 06:00.981
I got real hot,
and then I could hear colors.

06:01.014 --> 06:02.316
I liked it!

06:02.348 --> 06:03.616
Thank you, Pat.

06:03.649 --> 06:05.151
Think we owe ourselves a beach day.

06:05.184 --> 06:06.819
You'll take that test again, Peg.

06:06.853 --> 06:08.588
I'll tutor you on left turns.

06:08.622 --> 06:10.456
We can go to the graveyard...

06:10.482 --> 06:12.251
...so you can't hurt anyone.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.736
I don't need any help from you

06:13.760 --> 06:15.260
Burns and Schreibers.

06:15.261 --> 06:17.764
I'll practice with
my good friend Helen Portollo,

06:17.797 --> 06:19.166
and <i> she</i> can take me to the test.

06:19.199 --> 06:21.068
You <i> hate</i> your good friend
Helen Portollo.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.403
At least she's not a cackling jackanape.

06:23.435 --> 06:25.404
Plus, she and Steven
are having martial problems,

06:25.437 --> 06:28.108
so if I don't pass,
I'll have that to cheer me up.

06:28.141 --> 06:31.478
<i>But my mom chose Helen for
an entirely different reason.</i>

06:31.511 --> 06:34.248
<i>She didn't just ask Helen to
take her</i> to <i> the driving test.</i>

06:34.281 --> 06:36.800
<i>She asked Helen to
take the driving test</i> for <i> her.</i>

06:36.825 --> 06:37.988
Psst.

06:38.013 --> 06:39.586
What do I say is your weight?

06:39.619 --> 06:41.456
Just put down <i> your</i> weight

06:41.481 --> 06:43.257
and subtract 20 pounds.

06:43.290 --> 06:44.958
Use <i> my</i> age, not yours.

06:44.990 --> 06:47.193
I don't want to have to take
this test again in six months.

06:47.226 --> 06:49.028
<i>Helen had no problem making left turns.</i>

06:49.062 --> 06:50.329
<i>In fact, my mom was with her</i>

06:50.362 --> 06:51.999
<i>when she left-turned up her driveway</i>

06:52.031 --> 06:54.000
<i>and right over her husband's golf clubs.</i>

06:54.033 --> 06:56.103
<i>So Helen had no choice but to help.</i>

06:56.136 --> 06:58.505
Any chance you remember
your actual hair color?

06:58.538 --> 07:00.607
It's gonna be you in the
picture, so whatever <i> that</i> is.

07:00.639 --> 07:01.871
Scarecrow Number Nine?

07:06.478 --> 07:08.481
Smile, Mrs. Cleary.

07:12.886 --> 07:15.122
This one goes to Cathy with a "C,"

07:15.155 --> 07:17.524
"XOXO, David Cassidy."

07:17.557 --> 07:18.958
And throw in an extra "XO"

07:18.992 --> 07:20.627
because daddy likey Cathy with a "C."

07:20.660 --> 07:22.329
I feel like we're crossing a line here.

07:22.362 --> 07:23.830
Oh, unbunch your panties.

07:23.862 --> 07:25.398
It's Hollywood. We're selling dreams.

07:25.432 --> 07:27.201
We're selling hair you clipped
off Eddie and Lawrence

07:27.233 --> 07:28.534
while they were sleeping.

07:28.567 --> 07:29.902
While they were <i> dreaming.</i>

07:29.935 --> 07:32.038
It's probably against the law.

07:32.071 --> 07:33.874
William...

07:33.906 --> 07:36.209
these are the precious days
of our youth,

07:36.242 --> 07:38.144
when we can't be tried as adults.

07:38.177 --> 07:40.047
Cherish this fragile time,

07:40.079 --> 07:42.315
because it'll be gone in a blink.

07:42.348 --> 07:44.083
I have been trying for weeks,
and I can't get into

07:44.117 --> 07:45.852
that audition
for "The Partridge Family."

07:45.884 --> 07:47.553
Aren't you supposed to have
an agent for that stuff?

07:47.586 --> 07:49.021
My agent bugs them every day.

07:49.055 --> 07:51.091
I told them you're a pisher
with the punim of a star,

07:51.124 --> 07:53.427
but they're meshuggah over there. I...

07:53.459 --> 07:55.061
I'm gonna have to go down to the studio

07:55.095 --> 07:56.730
and talk to someone in casting.

07:56.762 --> 07:58.264
While you're there,
bring home a few trinkets...

07:58.297 --> 08:00.132
a gum wrapper from Shirley Jones,

08:00.165 --> 08:01.767
David Cassidy's comb.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.103
Or, if the situation presents itself,

08:04.136 --> 08:05.771
hot-wire that crazy bus.

08:05.805 --> 08:07.708
I can't steal from future co-stars.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.509
Acting exists within a cocoon of trust.

08:10.543 --> 08:13.680
It's called show <i> business,</i>
not show <i> ripping-people-off.</i>

08:13.713 --> 08:16.083
Hey, Joey, what's up with the hair?

08:16.115 --> 08:17.783
Just making wigs for sick children.

08:17.817 --> 08:19.920
It's a program I call "Joey Cares."

08:19.953 --> 08:22.756
You jerk! You cut a big clump off
my head while I was sleeping!

08:22.788 --> 08:24.957
All donations to "Joey Cares"
are tax-deductible.

08:24.990 --> 08:27.927
You cut my hair again
and Joey will hurt.

08:27.961 --> 08:29.028
And no one will care.

08:29.062 --> 08:30.631
That's not the worst of it.

08:30.663 --> 08:32.532
He is peddling this junk

08:32.565 --> 08:34.568
to little school kids on playgrounds.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.602
You seem to know a lot
about my activities.

08:36.635 --> 08:38.538
In the still of the night,
I walk the house

08:38.571 --> 08:40.374
for both knowledge and security.

08:40.407 --> 08:41.707
Maybe I should move out.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.576
Mock if you want,
but it's a small price to pay

08:43.610 --> 08:45.544
to see Mom smile.

08:45.577 --> 08:47.481
That's right... she smiles!

08:48.551 --> 08:50.317
But only in her sleep.

08:52.818 --> 08:54.288
Take me with you.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.098
Once I finish this sandwich,
you and I are returning

08:58.124 --> 08:59.493
the money you took
from those little girls.

08:59.525 --> 09:01.060
The only reason
we're not leaving right now

09:01.094 --> 09:02.896
is I'm racing the
expiration date on this bologna.

09:02.928 --> 09:05.185
And you're giving back
every dirty penny.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.234
Can you please point your
weasel face at somebody else?

09:07.267 --> 09:08.735
Buddy, this weasel face

09:08.768 --> 09:10.470
is the best friend you've got right now.

09:10.503 --> 09:12.973
I don't know how long I can
keep this guy from losing it.

09:13.005 --> 09:14.640
- Shut up, Frank.
- Hoh hoh!

09:14.673 --> 09:16.442
There's a little taste right there.

09:16.475 --> 09:19.278
You don't have to take Joey
to return the money, Mike.

09:19.312 --> 09:21.014
Let another licensed driver

09:21.047 --> 09:23.350
have the pleasure of shaming our child.

09:23.383 --> 09:25.852
Look at you, Mom!<i>
There's</i> your 4:00 A.M. smile.

09:25.884 --> 09:27.920
Congratulations. Let me see.

09:27.953 --> 09:30.690
No, no. My good friend Helen
gets to see this first.

09:30.724 --> 09:33.427
In a way, it's as much hers
as it is mine.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.461
If the picture looks anything
like you, Mom, it's stunning.

09:35.495 --> 09:37.864
Sorry, son. She's taken.

09:37.897 --> 09:39.466
Honey, I'm proud of you.

09:39.499 --> 09:40.801
Oh, well, save your pride.

09:40.834 --> 09:42.302
Joey, let's go. Frank, you too.

09:42.335 --> 09:44.304
You can watch your brother
apologize to girls.

09:44.336 --> 09:45.871
It's a skill you're gonna need.

09:45.904 --> 09:47.341
His name is Boris.

09:47.374 --> 09:49.209
So just get him talking
and facing <i> that</i> direction.

09:49.241 --> 09:51.177
I'll slip past
and go find the casting people.

09:51.211 --> 09:53.013
- Just go.

How I miss the gentle art
of a conversation.

11:18.831 --> 11:20.200
You know who <i> doesn't</i> miss it?

11:20.232 --> 11:21.567
People you're talking to.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.135
What on Earth?

11:23.168 --> 11:25.138
Fuzz on your tail, Mom. I smell bacon.

11:25.171 --> 11:26.706
This is what's wrong with America...

11:26.739 --> 11:28.108
police hassling innocent citizens

11:28.140 --> 11:29.642
while the Manson Family is out there

11:29.676 --> 11:31.311
stabbing folks willy-nilly.

11:32.912 --> 11:34.181
This picture isn't you, ma'am.

11:35.414 --> 11:36.582
Don't be silly.

11:36.615 --> 11:38.117
I mean, it's not
the most flattering portrait,

11:38.150 --> 11:39.285
but I'd been up all night

11:39.318 --> 11:40.886
and was recently punched in the face

11:40.919 --> 11:42.588
by one of those boxing kangaroos.

11:42.621 --> 11:43.889
You gave as good as you got, Mom.

11:43.922 --> 11:45.658
My sons can vouch that that's me.

11:45.692 --> 11:47.092
Right, Frank?

11:47.125 --> 11:50.764
Well, Officer-of-the-law,
my mom says it's her, so...

11:53.799 --> 11:55.435
I'm sorry. It's all going black.

11:56.802 --> 11:58.504
I'm gonna confiscate this license.

11:58.538 --> 12:00.139
Do you need me to call your husband

12:00.172 --> 12:01.475
so he can come and get you?

12:01.508 --> 12:03.009
I doubt you'll be able to reach him.

12:03.042 --> 12:04.610
Today's his day in the hot air balloon.

12:04.644 --> 12:05.946
My son Frank will drive us home.

12:05.979 --> 12:07.848
I'm in no fit state.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.783
I've got this, Officer.

12:12.118 --> 12:13.153
Okay.

12:13.186 --> 12:15.187
You drive safely, now, Dr. Reauchamp.

12:21.827 --> 12:24.497
Not a word to your father
about that pushy policeman

12:24.530 --> 12:25.664
taking my license.

12:25.697 --> 12:27.118
I'm talking to <i> you,</i> Frank.

12:27.143 --> 12:29.168
I know we can count on
Dr. Reauchamp to lie.

12:31.058 --> 12:34.640
What in the blue blazes
did you do to yourself?!

12:34.673 --> 12:37.043
He fell off a wall
and straight down a manhole.

12:37.076 --> 12:39.446
Kid can't even fall off a wall normal.

12:39.479 --> 12:42.215
'Course you had to be wearing
your new Towncraft from JCPenney.

12:42.248 --> 12:43.617
Where's the sleeve?

12:43.649 --> 12:45.184
Doctor couldn't save it.
He did all he could.

12:45.217 --> 12:47.187
Ohh. Go to your room.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.189
And if you start vomiting,
steer it away from that shirt.

12:49.221 --> 12:50.789
It's going back to Penney's
in the morning.

12:50.822 --> 12:52.225
Our outing was uneventful.

12:52.258 --> 12:53.393
We gave money to little girls

12:53.426 --> 12:54.528
in exchange for hair and underwear.

12:54.561 --> 12:56.028
Right, Frank?

12:56.062 --> 12:57.496
Am I leaving anything out?

12:57.529 --> 12:58.865
Everything fine. Not lying.

12:59.831 --> 13:01.201
There you are.

13:01.234 --> 13:02.668
Well, let's be fair, Mom.

13:02.701 --> 13:04.004
There was a <i> teensy</i> bit of lying.

13:04.037 --> 13:05.906
I mean, you lied to that cop
who stopped us.

13:05.938 --> 13:07.673
What cop?

13:07.706 --> 13:09.975
Oh. The man pulled me over to flirt.

13:10.009 --> 13:11.644
You signed up for that
when you married me.

13:11.677 --> 13:14.313
<i>And</i> you lied about it being
your picture on your license.

13:14.346 --> 13:15.915
<i>And</i> you lied to the DMV

13:15.948 --> 13:18.183
when you had Helen Portollo
take your test for you.

13:18.216 --> 13:20.519
And <i> then</i> you told me and Frank
to lie to Dad about it.

13:20.552 --> 13:22.855
Whew! That pretty much covers
all Mom's lies.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.858
Anyways, how was
hot air ballooning today, Pop?

13:24.890 --> 13:26.659
This is a new low, young man.

13:26.692 --> 13:28.327
Blatantly disobeying me

13:28.360 --> 13:30.096
when I specifically told you
to lie to your father!

13:30.129 --> 13:32.331
How can we trust a word he says?

13:32.365 --> 13:33.667
What do <i> you</i> have to say?

13:33.700 --> 13:35.936
Uh... Jo... Mo... Mom good, Joey bad.

13:35.969 --> 13:37.537
Go out back and pull weeds
until your father and I

13:37.570 --> 13:39.406
can come up with
an even worse punishment!

13:39.438 --> 13:40.940
Geez!

13:40.974 --> 13:42.208
Makes you wonder where we failed.

13:44.043 --> 13:45.845
Helen took your driving test for you?

13:45.878 --> 13:48.081
At this point, are you surprised
by anything that woman does?

13:48.114 --> 13:50.050
What's really troubling is these kids.

13:50.082 --> 13:51.451
You told them to lie to me.

13:51.484 --> 13:52.953
What kind of moral example is that?

13:52.985 --> 13:55.455
An excellent one, apparently,
since Joey told the truth

13:55.488 --> 13:57.123
under tremendous pressure not to,

13:57.155 --> 13:59.058
unlike weak-kneed Frank here.

13:59.091 --> 14:01.293
But you were the one
who did something wrong.

14:01.326 --> 14:04.029
Nice try. You had your chance
to rat me out, and you blew it.

14:04.062 --> 14:05.865
Don't glom onto Joey's coattails

14:05.898 --> 14:08.134
now that he's out there pulling
weeds for doing what's right!

14:08.167 --> 14:09.603
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

14:09.635 --> 14:11.605
I <i> am.</i> I-I should be pulling weeds, too.

14:11.638 --> 14:13.540
Go ahead! If he'll let you.

14:13.572 --> 14:14.773
<i>I</i> wouldn't.

14:14.807 --> 14:16.710
But, then, Joey's
a better person than all of us!

14:16.743 --> 14:18.378
And I'm not even counting
the work he does

14:18.411 --> 14:19.746
for the "Joey Cares" foundation!

14:24.350 --> 14:25.752
That was a tricky one.

14:25.784 --> 14:29.154
But... think we got to
the other side of it.

14:29.187 --> 14:31.490
You drove with a fake license.

14:31.523 --> 14:32.591
What if something happened?

14:32.624 --> 14:33.994
We could lose the house...

14:34.027 --> 14:36.229
not to mention
whatever house you drove into.

14:37.263 --> 14:38.932
There you go again,

14:38.965 --> 14:40.966
undermining me with your little jokes.

14:40.999 --> 14:43.003
It's no wonder
I get nervous driving. Huh?

14:43.036 --> 14:44.638
I-I start turning left into traffic,

14:44.671 --> 14:46.339
and all I can think about
is you and the boys

14:46.371 --> 14:48.341
having a gas and a giggle
at poor old Peggy.

14:48.374 --> 14:50.364
- Come on. I di...
- It's a lot harder to have faith in yourself

14:50.389 --> 14:52.812
when your own family
doesn't believe in you.

14:52.845 --> 14:56.615
Driving is new and scary for me, Mike.

14:56.648 --> 14:57.984
But go ahead... yuk it up!

14:58.017 --> 14:59.486
I won't get a license!

14:59.519 --> 15:01.287
The squirrels are safe once again!

15:05.323 --> 15:08.027
Well, the "Partridge Family"
casting guy called.

15:08.061 --> 15:10.596
He finally finished listening to
your dozens of phone messages.

15:10.629 --> 15:13.365
Yeah, I used different accents
to showcase my range.

15:13.398 --> 15:14.967
He offered an audition time for later.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.702
But since you're in no shape to go...

15:16.735 --> 15:19.139
Please to tell me what time, comrade!

15:19.172 --> 15:20.706
That's actually pretty good.

15:20.740 --> 15:22.475
- Peg, listen.
- Shh!

15:22.508 --> 15:23.977
You wake this baby, so help me,

15:24.009 --> 15:25.711
I will beat you to death with this baby.

15:29.414 --> 15:30.649
What?

15:30.682 --> 15:32.485
I understand it's been hard for you,

15:32.518 --> 15:34.570
this license thing.

15:34.595 --> 15:36.875
Driver's license... such rigmarole.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.624
In Europe, anyone can drive at <i> any</i> age

15:38.658 --> 15:39.859
on <i> either</i> side of the street.

15:39.892 --> 15:41.227
Look, I'll admit,

15:41.259 --> 15:43.862
y-you driving wasn't something
I thought was important.

15:43.895 --> 15:45.365
But maybe it <i> is.</i>

15:45.398 --> 15:47.466
I should've been better about it.

15:47.499 --> 15:49.235
No more insensitive jokes.

15:49.268 --> 15:51.370
From now on, I'll stick to picking on

15:51.403 --> 15:53.405
Polish people and fatsos.

15:53.438 --> 15:55.874
Aww, honey. That's so sweet.

15:57.342 --> 15:59.312
But... I hate myself for saying this...

15:59.345 --> 16:01.915
it's not entirely your fault.

16:01.947 --> 16:03.982
There's just something
about left turns...

16:04.015 --> 16:07.252
I freeze, like that deer
I ran over last week.

16:07.286 --> 16:08.855
You'll find a way to calm yourself

16:08.888 --> 16:09.922
and take the test again.

16:09.956 --> 16:11.591
You can beat this.

16:11.624 --> 16:13.225
Hey.

16:13.259 --> 16:14.494
You know how nervous I get

16:14.527 --> 16:16.196
when I have to speak in front of people.

16:16.229 --> 16:18.398
But I've developed this clever trick

16:18.431 --> 16:19.532
to help me relax.

16:19.565 --> 16:21.501
That's a great idea...

16:21.533 --> 16:22.615
alcohol!

16:22.640 --> 16:23.693
Hey!

16:23.718 --> 16:25.170
No. Not alcohol.

16:25.203 --> 16:26.438
I say a few Hail Marys.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.273
Well, good for you.
Where's the cooking wine?

16:28.307 --> 16:31.177
You can't drink before the driving test!

16:31.210 --> 16:33.680
Drinking <i> after</i> it won't do me any good.

16:33.712 --> 16:35.748
According to my friend Dino,
they smell booze on your breath,

16:35.782 --> 16:37.350
it's an automatic fail.

16:37.383 --> 16:39.085
And offering the guy a beer
does <i> not</i> help.

16:39.118 --> 16:40.386
There are more enlightened ways

16:40.418 --> 16:42.020
of dealing with nervousness, Mom.

16:42.053 --> 16:44.456
Have you considered T.M....
Transcendental Meditation?

16:44.490 --> 16:46.392
Sure. I'll just join
a naked hippie cult.

16:46.424 --> 16:48.260
As always, very helpful, Lawrence.

16:48.293 --> 16:49.728
Wendi's father is afraid of flying,

16:49.762 --> 16:50.864
so his doctor gave him sedatives.

16:50.897 --> 16:52.365
We did that with the dog.

16:52.398 --> 16:54.533
Remember Bosco, when he got
old and jittery?

16:54.567 --> 16:56.135
Especially around Mom.

16:56.168 --> 16:58.071
That's just 'cause I didn't
fuss over him, like all of <i> you.</i>

16:58.104 --> 16:59.706
"Oh, such a good boy."

16:59.739 --> 17:00.672
Then prove it!

17:00.706 --> 17:02.776
All that shameless begging.

17:02.808 --> 17:04.978
That's why I prefer a peacock.

17:05.010 --> 17:06.546
They're beautiful, but they're mean.

17:06.578 --> 17:08.213
Yeah. That tracks.

17:08.247 --> 17:10.344
Bosco got nervous in the car,
just like you, Peg.

17:10.368 --> 17:11.984
That's why the vet
gave him the sedatives.

17:12.018 --> 17:14.887
I remember. They cost $11.

17:14.921 --> 17:17.624
Ohh. I bet we have some of those left.

17:17.656 --> 17:19.324
I was heartbroken after Bosco died.

17:19.357 --> 17:21.326
Couldn't get a refund
from that pharmacist.

17:21.358 --> 17:22.761
Now, where are they?

17:22.795 --> 17:24.964
Do dog sedatives work on people?

17:24.997 --> 17:26.566
They actually work pretty great.

17:29.134 --> 17:30.970
I think I know where they might be.

17:31.002 --> 17:32.605
I'll bet you do.

17:35.473 --> 17:37.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:38.778 --> 17:39.979
This looks like a bad idea.

17:40.011 --> 17:41.780
Ohh! Thank you.

17:41.814 --> 17:43.583
Just do it. I'm not
missing my chance at stardom.

17:43.615 --> 17:45.117
Talk some sense into him.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.952
I just meant letting William do it,

17:46.986 --> 17:48.755
when Dr. Reauchamp is on duty.

17:48.788 --> 17:49.823
Here, let me take a look.

17:51.824 --> 17:54.027
Yeah, that's healing nicely.

17:54.059 --> 17:54.961
Okay.

17:58.364 --> 18:00.533
How's your arm feel?

18:00.566 --> 18:03.202
Like a dead ham hanging off my shoulder.

18:03.236 --> 18:05.138
Hey, kid! How ya feeling?

18:05.171 --> 18:06.506
Never better.

18:06.538 --> 18:08.874
'Cause you fell down a 12-foot manhole.

18:08.907 --> 18:10.642
I do all my own stunts.

18:10.675 --> 18:13.145
I should be on, uh, your list for today.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.047
Yep, there it is... Timmy Cleary.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.015
Sign right there next to your name.

18:20.051 --> 18:22.221
It... seems to be out of ink.

18:22.255 --> 18:23.890
Ah, just give it a good shake.

18:26.726 --> 18:27.894
Ow!

18:27.926 --> 18:29.862
Ow.

18:29.895 --> 18:32.464
You know, you seem a little old

18:32.498 --> 18:33.866
to be playing Chris Partridge.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.035
I'm auditioning for <i> Danny.</i>

18:36.067 --> 18:37.871
You were the one who tipped
me off they were recasting.

18:37.903 --> 18:39.873
<i>I</i> did? I got that way wrong.

18:39.905 --> 18:42.207
They're recasting the little brother.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.042
You can't fire Bonaduce.

18:44.076 --> 18:46.880
He's a monster,
but he's a monster talent.

18:46.913 --> 18:48.981
Who cares if he ran me over
with a golf cart?

18:49.015 --> 18:52.018
It's called show <i> business,</i>
not show <i> be-nice-to-Boris.</i>

18:52.050 --> 18:53.418
So I don't get to be Danny?

18:53.451 --> 18:54.420
No.

18:54.452 --> 18:55.956
But <i> you</i> seem to be

18:55.981 --> 18:58.245
just about the right age to play Chris.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.358
You play the drums?

18:59.392 --> 19:02.929
I play 17 musical instruments,
including the didgeridoo.

19:02.961 --> 19:04.396
That's perfect!

19:04.430 --> 19:06.266
Actually, I don't know.
I've never seen the show.

19:06.298 --> 19:07.532
Do this, William.

19:07.566 --> 19:09.602
Take my spot.

19:09.634 --> 19:12.204
Get to the top,
then pull me up behind you,

19:12.238 --> 19:14.074
like Charlton Heston did
for his brother Jerry.

19:16.875 --> 19:19.711
Thanks, but I prefer
to live a quiet life

19:19.744 --> 19:21.113
away from the limelight.

19:21.146 --> 19:23.081
Oh, you're missing a bet there, kid.

19:23.115 --> 19:26.019
Become a child star...
take it from me...

19:26.051 --> 19:28.420
the rest of your life is Easy Street.

19:29.422 --> 19:30.523
Eh.

19:38.631 --> 19:40.066
Guess Mom passed her test.

19:40.098 --> 19:42.601
Congratulations, Mommy!

19:42.634 --> 19:44.604
The world's first female driver.

19:47.605 --> 19:49.409
How's the weeding?

19:49.442 --> 19:51.210
Wouldn't be so bad, except
every time I pull one out,

19:51.242 --> 19:52.544
Pat replants it.

19:52.577 --> 19:53.980
I'm learning how to farm.

19:55.614 --> 19:57.583
Sorry about ratting you out to Dad.

19:57.615 --> 19:59.152
What was that all about?

19:59.184 --> 20:01.421
I can't object to you having
a friend take a test for you.

20:01.453 --> 20:03.956
I-I mean, I'm in 8th grade,
I'm a straight-A student,

20:03.990 --> 20:06.826
and I don't even know how to read.

20:06.858 --> 20:09.628
What bugged me was
you giving up on yourself

20:09.662 --> 20:11.965
and thinking that
you couldn't pass that test.

20:11.998 --> 20:13.932
Well, I completed a left turn.

20:13.965 --> 20:15.567
He gave me a perfect score.

20:15.601 --> 20:17.570
Glad you toughed it out, Mom.

20:17.603 --> 20:18.904
I'm proud of you.

20:18.938 --> 20:20.974
Well, I did have <i> some</i> help.

20:21.007 --> 20:22.307
Thank you, Bosco.

20:22.340 --> 20:23.775
Good boy.

20:23.808 --> 20:24.978
Finally.

20:32.817 --> 20:35.020
Joey's still picking those weeds?

20:35.054 --> 20:36.522
Fast as he picks them,
Pat's putting them back.

20:36.555 --> 20:37.757
Idiot.

20:39.357 --> 20:42.095
What's wrong? Why aren't you
piling on the kids with me?

20:42.127 --> 20:45.097
I just hate that I needed a pill
to pass that test.

20:45.131 --> 20:46.699
Remember that "Barnaby Jones"

20:46.731 --> 20:49.167
about the housewife
who got hooked on the goofballs?

20:49.201 --> 20:50.870
Honey, you're not gonna end up

20:50.903 --> 20:52.305
a go-go dancer in a biker bar

20:52.337 --> 20:54.139
to feed the monkey on your back.

20:54.172 --> 20:56.174
Well, I'd like to think
I could if I wanted to.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.211
Certainly better than Patty Duke.

20:58.243 --> 21:00.612
The thing is, I switched out
those dog pills

21:00.645 --> 21:01.780
for some Tic Tacs.

21:01.814 --> 21:05.051
That left turn today was all you.

21:06.751 --> 21:09.520
- My mouth did feel suspiciously fresh.
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.545 --> 21:11.940
Even Ron noticed.

21:12.042 --> 21:13.626
Thank you, honey.

21:13.659 --> 21:15.348
Guess it was a rare "Barnaby Jones,"

21:15.373 --> 21:16.796
where they got it all wrong.

21:16.828 --> 21:18.998
I don't buy that guy as a detective.

21:19.030 --> 21:23.036
To me, he is and always will be
Mr. Jed Clampett.

21:23.068 --> 21:24.744
Mm-hmm.

21:26.706 --> 21:31.706
