18:19.767 --> 18:20.867
SO AM I.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.000
[SIGHS]
CORY'S MY BEST FRIEND.

18:27.700 --> 18:30.200
BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU
TO YOUR FACE THAT...

18:30.200 --> 18:34.667
IF I KNEW THAT YOU AND I
WEREN'T FRIENDS ANYMORE...

18:34.667 --> 18:36.367
IT'D BREAK MY HEART, TOO.

18:39.233 --> 18:40.900
YOU WANT SOUP?

18:42.367 --> 18:44.500
WILL YOU FEED IT TO ME?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.033
WHERE ARE THEY?

18:52.033 --> 18:53.667
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

18:53.667 --> 18:55.600
I'M SUPPOSED TO SHOOT HOOPS.
I CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.033
CAN'T FIND WHAT?
MY TUBE SOCKS!
MY LUCKY TUBE SOCKS.

18:58.033 --> 19:00.467
HAVE YOU BY ANY CHANCE
SEEN THEM ANYWHERE?

19:00.467 --> 19:02.300
OH, UH...

19:02.300 --> 19:05.133
YOU'RE GONNA FIND THIS
KIND OF HARD
TO BELIEVE, ERIC,

19:05.133 --> 19:06.500
BUT, UH, LAST NIGHT,

19:06.500 --> 19:09.100
FOR NO LOGICAL REASON
THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY
THINK OF,

19:09.100 --> 19:12.133
I DID THE WASH
INSTEAD OF MOM,

19:12.133 --> 19:13.967
AND--WELL...[LAUGHS]

19:13.967 --> 19:15.600
THIS IS SO FUNNY.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.500
WHERE ARE MY LUCKY
TUBE SOCKS?

19:18.500 --> 19:19.700
WELL...

19:19.700 --> 19:22.200
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
SO LUCKY ANYMORE.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.400
THAT'S NOT THE LINE.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.934
WHAT?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.400
THE LINE WAS,

19:29.400 --> 19:30.934
"HONEY, I SHRUNK
THE TUBE SOCKS."

19:30.934 --> 19:33.567
OH, UH--I KNOW.
I'M SORRY, WILL.

19:33.567 --> 19:34.934
I WAS TRYING
SOMETHING NEW.

19:34.934 --> 19:37.600
OH, YOU WERE JUST--
YOU WERE TRYING SOMETHING NEW.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.500
YEAH. HERE,
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS, HUH?

19:39.500 --> 19:43.233
IS THIS NEW?!
DOES THIS ALL LOOK NEW
TO YOU?!

19:43.233 --> 19:44.500
HERE'S NEW!

19:44.500 --> 19:45.700
YEAH!

19:45.700 --> 19:47.400
I QUIT!
I'M OUTTA HERE!

19:50.233 --> 19:52.700
CORY! ERIC! GUESS WHAT!

19:52.700 --> 19:54.600
I BLEW UP ANOTHER MAILBOX.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.400
WHAT, WILL FLIP OUT AGAIN?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.100
YEAH, YEAH, HE DID.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.367
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

20:03.367 --> 20:04.934
I MEAN, HE'S
GONNA BE HARD TO REPLACE.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.100
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.767
HEY, BANANA BOY!

20:13.000 --> 20:14.200
WANT TO BE A STAR?

20:15.400 --> 20:16.500
HUH?
COME HERE.
