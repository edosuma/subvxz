WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:03.350
not only did that movie suck,it
blew chunks,bit the big one,

00:03.360 --> 00:05.930
and then came back and sucked again.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.830
- Did you pay for it?
- Yeah.

00:07.840 --> 00:11.120
With an hour and a half of my
childhood that I'll never get back.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.660
Hey,I've seen your childhood.

00:13.670 --> 00:15.860
It's not a big loss.

00:15.870 --> 00:17.030
You said you wanted to see it.

00:17.040 --> 00:17.940
Because it was rated R.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.520
But there wasn't a single boob in it.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.890
You were there.

00:22.900 --> 00:23.780
Oh,my god.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.950
I know. And he talks to
me that way all the time.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.140
That's cynthia sullivan.

00:30.150 --> 00:31.430
Who's cynthia sullivan?

00:31.440 --> 00:33.760
She and her husband used to
be friends with me and judith.

00:33.770 --> 00:34.780
Yeah,so?

00:34.790 --> 00:36.570
Well,I haven't seen her
since judith and I split up.

00:36.580 --> 00:38.250
I-I don't know if i should say hello.

00:38.260 --> 00:40.770
They kind of took judith's
side in the divorce.

00:40.780 --> 00:43.850
Wait a minute. We're
allowed to take sides?

00:44.800 --> 00:47.410
Nobody told me. Is it too late?

00:47.420 --> 00:48.820
That's not funny,charlie.

00:48.830 --> 00:52.240
He's very hurtful to
everybody,and for no reason.

00:52.660 --> 00:53.940
Alan?

00:53.950 --> 00:55.880
Oh,hey,cynthia.

00:56.940 --> 00:58.590
Wow,what a nice surprise. How are you?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.440
Just great. 'S'seen a long time.

01:01.450 --> 01:03.810
Hi,jake. Look how big you're getting.

01:03.820 --> 01:05.790
It's called puberty.

01:06.420 --> 01:08.780
It's called donuts.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.500
Donuts don't make hair.

01:14.690 --> 01:17.550
Uh,cynthia,this is my brother charlie.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.680
Hello.

01:18.690 --> 01:23.690
Uh,cynthia and her husband were good friends with me
and judith back when we were,you know,me and judith.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.770
And when we were me and bill.

01:25.780 --> 01:27.320
What? Oh,you're not with bill anymore?

01:27.330 --> 01:30.000
No. You know,we decided to
finally stop kidding ourselves.

01:30.010 --> 01:30.760
You know how it is.

01:30.770 --> 01:32.020
I-I certainly do.

01:32.030 --> 01:33.950
No,you don'T.

01:35.310 --> 01:37.070
Of course I do.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.530
Cynthia,did you get the
house in the divorce?

01:39.560 --> 01:40.120
Yes.

01:40.130 --> 01:42.340
So you're not currently sleeping
on your brother's hide-a-bed?

01:42.350 --> 01:44.490
- No.
- You don't know how it is.

01:46.150 --> 01:48.600
Again,completely unmotivated.

01:48.610 --> 01:52.720
Well,okay,it was really
nice to see you again,alan.

01:52.730 --> 01:54.430
We should get together
sometime and catch up.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.720
Yeah,that would be nice.

01:55.730 --> 01:57.130
Nice meeting you.

01:57.140 --> 01:58.870
Bye,jake.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.890
- You dog.
- What?

02:03.360 --> 02:04.040
Oh,come on.

02:04.050 --> 02:06.440
The full-frontal hug,the
"let's get together."

02:06.450 --> 02:10.300
Isn't that like soccer mom talk
for "do me in the cul-de-sac"?

02:14.310 --> 02:15.600
what are you snickering at?

02:15.610 --> 02:18.110
Oh,tell me that's not dirty.

02:19.150 --> 02:21.330
Go get us a table. Come on.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.720
Charlie,you don't understand.

02:22.730 --> 02:25.890
She and her husband were our
best friends for like ten years.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.130
We-we traveled together,we
spent vacations together...

02:28.150 --> 02:30.670
and you never once
fantasized about boinking her?

02:30.680 --> 02:32.600
She was judith's friend.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.200
I was her husband's friend.

02:34.210 --> 02:36.190
Of course I did.

02:37.960 --> 02:42.430
Yeah,hi. Two regular
coffees,please and,uh,one...

02:42.440 --> 02:46.540
chocolate crappuccino with
whipped cream and sprinkles.

02:47.110 --> 02:49.870
Well,here's your chance
to fulfill your fantasy.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.190
Oh,no,no,I couldn'T.

02:51.200 --> 02:51.960
Why not?

02:51.980 --> 02:53.560
Well,for one thing,I
don't want to upset judith.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.450
They're still friends.

02:54.460 --> 02:58.030
Alan,the fact that you're still
drawing breath upsets judith.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.390
Regardless,I-I couldn't go out with
cynthia without clearing it with her first.

03:01.410 --> 03:03.100
Meow.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.630
I am not whipped.

03:06.030 --> 03:07.620
What if the positions were reversed?

03:07.630 --> 03:10.260
Kekeuh,like judith was
single and wanted to date you.

03:10.270 --> 03:14.850
I would certainly want her to check with
me before I,you know,blew my brains out.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.590
Is that all it would
take? What's her number?

03:21.920 --> 03:22.840
Where did you get that?

03:22.850 --> 03:25.490
I found it on the table.

03:30.150 --> 03:31.410
Oh,jake...

03:31.420 --> 03:35.210
it's okay,I'm eating on the
side without teeth marks.

03:37.130 --> 03:40.540
Puberty,my ass. That's
a missing chromosome.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.920
No,I'm pretty sure it's a bear claw.

- hey,honey,how was...
- Not now,mom.I gotta go to the bathroom.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.610
Please tell me you didn't
let him eat a lot of crap.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.339
Let him?

04:19.350 --> 04:22.250
Judith,our son is a billy goat.

04:22.540 --> 04:26.300
I wouldn't be surprised if he's
in there pooping out tin cans.

04:26.310 --> 04:27.150
Lovely.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.230
Uh,wait,judith,I wanted
to ask you something.

04:30.510 --> 04:31.570
What?

04:31.580 --> 04:35.080
Well,uh,we were just having
coffee,and I happened to run into...

04:35.090 --> 04:37.540
charlie,can you give us a minute?

04:37.550 --> 04:39.850
No,I wanna watch th.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.610
Why?

04:42.620 --> 04:45.100
I think it might amuse me.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.190
Yeah,well,seek amusement elsewhere.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.120
Fine,I'll go talk to herb.

04:51.130 --> 04:54.430
Of all judith's husbands
he's my favorite,anyway.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.880
You know,jake's right.

04:57.890 --> 05:01.340
Sometimes you can be
hurtful for no reason at all.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.740
So who did you run into?

05:04.300 --> 05:05.770
cynthia sullivan.

05:05.780 --> 05:07.530
Okay,so?

05:07.540 --> 05:13.140
Uh,well,I know you're still friends,and
I was wondering if you'd be okay if I...

05:13.150 --> 05:14.500
asked her out.

05:14.510 --> 05:15.910
Fine.

05:15.920 --> 05:16.970
- Really?
- Sure.

05:16.980 --> 05:21.300
You're both adults,you're both single,and
most importantly,she won't go out with you.

05:23.060 --> 05:23.920
How do you know?

05:23.930 --> 05:24.900
I know.

05:24.910 --> 05:26.800
Has she said something to you?

05:26.810 --> 05:29.000
No. But you're not her type.

05:29.010 --> 05:30.300
Oh,really? What is her type?

05:30.310 --> 05:31.880
Well,like her ex-husband.

05:31.890 --> 05:35.450
Smart,funny,sensitive,good-looking.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.350
And that's not me?

05:37.360 --> 05:40.100
No,no... you can be funny.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.370
Okay,okay,but if she did agree to go
out with me,you'd be okay with that?

05:44.380 --> 05:45.410
I would,but she won'T.

05:45.420 --> 05:46.330
- But if she did?
- She won'T.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.820
- She might.
- She won'T.

05:51.660 --> 05:55.640
You know,charlie's not the only one
who can be hurtful for no reason!

05:56.160 --> 05:59.870
You know,herb,that is a fine,fine hat.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.410
Gotta wear it. Otherwise,I
freckle like a banana.

06:03.860 --> 06:08.250
Well,I wouldn't want your
banana to get freckled.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.900
- Let's go,charlie.
- Hang on,hang on.

06:10.910 --> 06:13.370
We're having a real
interesting conversation here.

06:13.650 --> 06:17.970
Hey,herb,tell alan what you told
me about how you plant seeds.

06:17.980 --> 06:21.060
Well,first,I make
sure the soil is moist.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.480
And tell him how you do that.

06:24.490 --> 06:28.440
Well,I just stick my finger
into old mother earth.

06:29.770 --> 06:34.490
If it comes up dry,I just whip out
my hose and give it a good spritz.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.100
And then?

06:36.110 --> 06:38.830
Then I carefully plant
the seed in the soil.

06:38.840 --> 06:39.880
Carefully?

06:39.890 --> 06:41.530
Why carefully?

06:41.540 --> 06:45.540
Well,because if you just fling that
stuff around,half of it's wasted.

06:49.090 --> 06:50.040
You hear that,alan?

06:50.050 --> 06:53.320
If you fling your seed
around,it gets wasted.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.520
Fascinating. Let's go.

06:54.530 --> 06:56.970
Now hold on,hold on.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.870
How do you feel about bushes,herb?

07:01.880 --> 07:05.430
Well,I like a full bush.

07:06.810 --> 07:09.650
The way god intended.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.240
I like 'em trimmed.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.850
- What about you,alan?
- We're going.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.960
- Bye,herb.
- Bye,fellas.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.060
Why do you do that to him?

07:20.070 --> 07:22.090
It amuses me.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.050
alan: Oh,great. So I will
pick you up tonight at 7:00.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.960
Yeah,yeah,I'm-I'm really
looking forward to it.

07:31.970 --> 07:34.270
Okay,okay,bye.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.300
Judith said cynthia wouldn't go
out with me,and she was wrong,s

07:46.730 --> 07:48.360
Hey,I told you she'd go out with you.

07:48.370 --> 07:49.610
And you were right,sir.

07:49.620 --> 07:54.800
I ignore you at my own peril when it
comes to women,liquor and venereal disease.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.840
Then listen to me now.

07:58.850 --> 08:01.010
be prepared for sex tonight.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.010
Sex? It'S...

08:02.020 --> 08:03.520
it's a first date.

08:03.530 --> 08:04.490
Not really.

08:04.510 --> 08:06.090
You and cynthia are old friends.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.380
You know each other,and
you like each other.

08:07.390 --> 08:09.820
You might as well smell like each other.

08:09.830 --> 08:11.060
No,I don't think so.

08:11.070 --> 08:13.340
- Not cynthia.
- Not cynthia?

08:13.350 --> 08:15.280
Alan,the woman's pushing 40.

08:15.290 --> 08:18.570
She's coming off a divorce and praying
that her looks hold out long enough

08:18.580 --> 08:22.880
so she can snag some pathetic loser she wouldn't
have been caught dead with five years ago.

08:24.290 --> 08:27.200
Oh,boy,I'm getting laid tonight!

08:28.630 --> 08:29.490
I'm saying.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.049
Oh,I wish I could rub
judith's nose in this.

08:32.059 --> 08:34.130
That would be a huge "ha!"

08:34.730 --> 08:36.820
Don't worry,judith'll find out.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.620
Are you gonna tell her?

08:38.630 --> 08:40.990
- No.
- Would you?

08:42.690 --> 08:45.110
Alan,cynthia will tell her.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.600
Oh,right,right. They're friends.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.350
More importantly,they're women.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.380
And you know how they
are-- blah,blah,blah.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.870
They tell each other everything.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.230
Trust mei 'l'lbe like judith is
watching every move you make tonight.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.210
Every move?

09:00.830 --> 09:02.780
So bring your a-game.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.590
Right,right.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.990
what if I don't have an a-game?

09:11.800 --> 09:15.740
You'd better find one,'cause you
don't wanna get yanked off the mound.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:24.580 --> 09:25.590
Where you going?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.580
Warm up the ol' pitching arm.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.200
I'm using a metaphor.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.200
So am I.

09:38.170 --> 09:41.440
oh,alan,I have fantasized
about this for so long.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.550
Me,too.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.890
Ever since we all went to disneyworld and you
wore that white t-shirt on splash mountain.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.300
Are you sure this isn't going too fast?

09:49.310 --> 09:50.060
Not a chance.

09:50.070 --> 09:52.760
I've been warming up all afternoon.

09:53.340 --> 09:55.620
Judith: Oh,real smooth,alan.

09:55.630 --> 09:59.410
Go ahead. I'm just gonna sit
here anwatch every move you make.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.690
Oh,alan,that was remarkable!

10:13.500 --> 10:15.930
remarkable good,right?

10:16.560 --> 10:18.220
Oh,yeah.

10:28.990 --> 10:33.250
I have to admit,I was a little
worried that this might be awkward.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.260
How come?

10:34.270 --> 10:37.010
Well,I mean,you know,I
am friends with judith.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.230
We do talk.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.240
No kidding?

10:39.250 --> 10:44.360
Well,the next time you talk,be
sure you use the word "remarkable."

10:44.860 --> 10:47.590
Alan,I'm not like that.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.890
I mean,I believe in discretion.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.970
Really? I think it's overrated.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.570
Go ahead,tell her.

10:52.970 --> 10:54.410
No.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.880
In fact,you know,I wish judith
had a little more discretion.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.090
What do you mean?

10:59.100 --> 11:03.540
Well,she just goes on and on
about her sex life with herb.

11:03.910 --> 11:06.430
Big bird's pretty boring,huh?

11:07.420 --> 11:08.210
No.

11:08.220 --> 11:11.800
I mean,the way she tells
it,he is an amazing lover.

11:11.810 --> 11:14.380
Yeah,that's what I thought... wait.

11:15.500 --> 11:19.240
Wait,wait. Herb melnick
is an amazing lover?

11:19.250 --> 11:23.130
Yeah. She said he's the
best that she's ever had.

11:23.460 --> 11:25.810
No. No.

11:25.820 --> 11:29.170
That...that... that
can't possibly be right.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.300
How can that be?

11:31.310 --> 11:35.640
Well,apparently he's just... no.

11:35.650 --> 11:36.910
I can't go into that.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.060
Sure,you can. Go ahead.

11:39.410 --> 11:41.570
No. It wouldn't be right.

11:41.580 --> 11:46.540
I'm sorry. Just forget I said anything.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.880
Best she's ever had.

12:15.970 --> 12:19.240
Oh,herb,you're the best I've ever had.

12:23.370 --> 12:25.750
- Morning.
- Morning.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.650
So,how did it go last night?

12:29.660 --> 12:32.370
You were right. We had sex.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.340
Then why the long face,seabiscuit?

12:40.690 --> 12:44.240
You're so much better than the
only other man I've ever been with.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.760
I've just got something on my mind.

12:48.770 --> 12:50.680
Like what?

12:50.690 --> 12:54.010
I had no idea what I was missing.

12:56.410 --> 12:58.660
Forget it.

13:03.330 --> 13:04.260
Oh,come on.

13:04.270 --> 13:06.590
- What's bothering you?
- Nothing.I'm fine.

13:14.050 --> 13:15.910
Oh,come on!

13:19.740 --> 13:21.920
Come on,what?

13:21.930 --> 13:25.820
In what universe is herb
melnick a better lover than me?

13:25.830 --> 13:27.190
Herb melnick?

13:27.200 --> 13:30.150
I thought you had sex
with cynthia last night.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.110
I did. But you know what she told me?

13:32.120 --> 13:36.000
That judith told her that herb
was the best lover she's ever had.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.530
How does that come up while
you're boffing cynthia?

13:40.910 --> 13:41.870
What difference does it make?

13:41.880 --> 13:44.480
I'm just trying to picture the context.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.750
"Oh,cynthia,I am so turned on right now!

13:46.760 --> 13:48.920
I wonder how herb does it to judith."

13:48.930 --> 13:50.380
No,it wasn't like that.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.940
Okay,was it,like,"golly,you
have firm buttocks.

13:52.950 --> 13:55.990
You know who else has a
nice ass? Herb melnick."

13:56.000 --> 13:58.250
I didn't bring up the subject
of herb's sexual prowess.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.230
Cynthia did.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.090
Oh,that's never a good sign.

14:03.100 --> 14:06.490
15 years judith and I were
together-- 12 years of marriage--

14:06.500 --> 14:09.130
and the best sex we ever had w mediocre.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.090
If you were having bad
sex,why did you marry her?

14:12.100 --> 14:13.230
What kind of stupid question is that?

14:13.240 --> 14:16.660
I told you,we were having sex.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.870
But she never enjoyed it.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.660
Certainly never sought it out.

14:20.670 --> 14:24.410
Then herb melnick comes along with
his tousled hair and goofy charm

14:24.420 --> 14:27.510
and lights her up like
an all-night liquor store.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.090
So you're saying...

14:31.100 --> 14:35.560
farmer herb is tilling soil you
couldn't even get your hoe into.

14:36.030 --> 14:37.140
M-my hoe?

14:37.150 --> 14:39.740
Yeah,you know,with an "e"? Hoe.

14:40.530 --> 14:41.870
Fine. Yes.

14:41.880 --> 14:47.050
And it's bothering you to know that night
after night he's planting a tree in israel.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.460
And by israel,I mean judith.

14:51.030 --> 14:51.820
Yes.

14:51.830 --> 14:52.920
And,by tree,I mean...

14:52.930 --> 14:54.680
I know what you mean. Okay?I get it.

14:54.690 --> 14:56.930
God! Why do you do this to me?

14:56.940 --> 14:58.460
Haven't I made that clear?

14:58.470 --> 15:00.240
It amuses me.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.300
Well,it's driving me nuts.

15:01.310 --> 15:03.330
I mean,what's his
secret? How does he do it?

15:03.340 --> 15:05.880
Maybe he's got a big trouser monkey.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.590
Have you been listening this whole time?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.370
Wouldn't you?

15:12.990 --> 15:13.780
You think she's right?

15:13.790 --> 15:15.590
You think he's just well-endowed?

15:15.960 --> 15:16.940
He could be.

15:16.950 --> 15:17.970
He's what,six four?

15:17.980 --> 15:19.220
Got big hands.

15:19.230 --> 15:23.030
If everything else is proportional,I'm guessing
he could ring doorbells with that thing.

15:23.950 --> 15:25.330
You're not helping.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.820
I rarely do.

15:27.430 --> 15:29.720
Oh,come on,alan,you're
looking at this the wrong way.

15:29.730 --> 15:30.520
What do you mean?

15:30.530 --> 15:34.010
Well... you're seeing
your ex-wife as half empty.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.390
- But with herb in the picture...
- shut up.

15:39.860 --> 15:41.700
Oh,get a room.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.730
oh,alan!

15:46.740 --> 15:48.100
Oh,cynthia!

15:48.120 --> 15:49.970
Judith: Oh,herb!

15:50.800 --> 15:52.400
Hey,buddy.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.230
Okay,I can't do this.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.860
Well,wh-what's the matter?

15:57.870 --> 16:00.770
I got to know-- what makes
herb the best judith's ever had?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.090
I thought we settled this.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.280
Yeah,but it's driving me crazy.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.670
I mean,is it just physical endowment?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.000
What?

16:07.020 --> 16:10.710
You know,can he put a hat on I
iand drive in the carpool lane?

16:10.970 --> 16:14.270
I am not gonna repeat what a
friend said to me in confidence.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.690
Don't give me that you're a woman.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.120
That's all you guys
do-- blah,blah,blah.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.690
you know what I think?

16:19.700 --> 16:22.000
I think that you're
still not over judith.

16:22.020 --> 16:24.250
Oh,please,I don't care
about judith. I just...

16:24.260 --> 16:27.040
I can't wrap my head
around herb's penis.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.320
Okay,I just realized
why your marriage ended.

16:31.330 --> 16:32.290
Why?

16:32.300 --> 16:35.740
Because something is
very wrong with you.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.970
oh,that.

16:40.690 --> 16:42.800
I think you should go home.

16:42.810 --> 16:44.670
But-but you said I was remarkable.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.450
Get out!

16:48.180 --> 16:49.790
Fine.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.660
Okay,I'll see you guys at home.

17:00.630 --> 17:04.089
* Oh,I come from alabama
with a banjo on my knee *

17:04.099 --> 17:08.220
* gonna grow toma,toes and
I've got some baby peas *

17:09.940 --> 17:10.980
Hey,fellas.

17:12.369 --> 17:14.290
- Here to pick up jake?
- Yeah.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.849
Another weekend with the boy.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.940
- Gonna take him to the movies.
- Okay.

17:21.579 --> 17:22.760
Well,he's waiting for you.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.180
- Oh,great.
- Great.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.069
Yeah. Come on,alan.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.850
I didn't see anything,did you?

17:29.860 --> 17:32.050
Nothing jumped out at me.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.400
I just don't get it--
what is his secret?

17:36.410 --> 17:38.190
Maybe he doesn't have a secret.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.670
What do you mean?

17:39.680 --> 17:43.060
I mean,you didn't set the
bar too high to begin with.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.390
It's like judith spent 15 years
living on peanut butter and jelly.

17:48.400 --> 17:53.510
So if someone comes along and offers her
baloney,she's goanthink it's a steak sandwich.

17:54.770 --> 17:57.230
Jake,your father's here!

17:57.240 --> 17:59.740
So,I'm sorry to hear
about you and cynthia.

17:59.750 --> 18:00.690
She told you.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.080
Of course she told
me-- we're friends.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.330
Did she happen to mention
the word... "remarkable"?

18:07.630 --> 18:10.890
No,but she did say she
didn't think you were over me.

18:10.900 --> 18:11.810
Oh,he's over you.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.700
- Right,alan?
- Right.

18:14.330 --> 18:17.350
But what's the deal with herb's junk?

18:19.570 --> 18:22.110
- What?
- Nothing.Nothing.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.490
- Hey,dad.
- Hey,buddy,let's go.Bye,judith.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.910
Real subtle.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.590
Sometimes you just gotta ask.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.290
See you on sunday,herb.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.770
Okay. Have a good weekend.

18:41.150 --> 18:43.050
Look at him go.

18:45.530 --> 18:48.070
Okay,mystery solved.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.240
Good for you-- never
too late to learn.
