00:01.227 --> 00:04.319
<i> -Previously on</i> Call Me Kat...
-(screaming)

00:04.338 --> 00:06.672
I had no idea
you were coming back.

00:06.899 --> 00:08.156
Obviously you ate well.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.492
This is a juice bar now.

00:10.586 --> 00:11.826
Where are the cats?

00:11.995 --> 00:13.253
I told you she'd notice.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.997
Now I'm at peace.
I just go with the flow.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.741
I even got a tattoo.
It's in Sanskrit.

00:17.834 --> 00:19.243
It says "acceptance."

00:19.261 --> 00:21.336
That says "garden salad."

00:21.355 --> 00:22.412
You sold a song?

00:22.431 --> 00:23.930
Aw, please, it's not
that big a deal.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.507
-Just to Kacey.
-Kacey...

00:25.526 --> 00:27.342
Musgraves.
Just a famous person,

00:27.436 --> 00:29.028
who I know.

00:29.255 --> 00:30.604
I didn't fire Randi.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.180
She left because
I didn't<i> love</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:34.107
every single thing
that she did to<i> my</i> café.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.926
I want you to be my partner.

00:35.928 --> 00:38.370
-Like 50-50?
-Ish.

00:38.597 --> 00:40.855
I've been making my mother
margaritas since I was nine.

00:40.949 --> 00:42.291
(blender whirs)

00:48.274 --> 00:50.290
I don't care for them.

00:50.442 --> 00:53.443
-What?
-Your new glasses.

00:53.462 --> 00:56.037
I assumed you were going to
ask me eventually.

00:56.131 --> 00:59.058
I wasn't...
for this exact reason.

00:59.209 --> 01:00.967
Will you take them off
when we get to the club?

01:01.120 --> 01:02.877
My friends will be there.

01:02.971 --> 01:04.805
Well, if anyone says anything,

01:04.957 --> 01:06.732
you can just pretend
not to know me.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.141
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.052
Tell the truth, you're
wearing them to spite me.

01:11.072 --> 01:14.147
No, the truth is
I need them to see.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.909
That it upsets you is
a welcome bonus.

01:17.060 --> 01:18.226
Where'd you get them,

01:18.395 --> 01:21.663
lost and found at the morgue?

01:22.917 --> 01:23.824
Hey!

01:23.918 --> 01:26.326
Oh, relax. It was a joke.

01:26.478 --> 01:30.130
Frankly, it's funnier that
you paid money for them.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.498
You just ran a stop sign.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.834
Did you not see
the big, red octagon?

01:34.002 --> 01:35.577
Don't be such a square.

01:36.505 --> 01:39.598
Geometry?
I thought you'd appreciate it,

01:39.825 --> 01:42.993
given you were the only member
of your high school math club.

01:43.011 --> 01:44.845
Hey, one is still a number.

01:44.997 --> 01:46.663
The loneliest.

01:46.756 --> 01:47.831
(siren chirps)

01:47.924 --> 01:50.867
Oh, great.
Now we're getting pulled over.

01:50.927 --> 01:52.336
I get it, Katharine,
you can see

01:52.429 --> 01:54.571
through your hideous glasses.

01:56.099 --> 01:56.949
What are you doing?

01:57.176 --> 01:59.860
Getting out of this ticket.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.529
Seriously, you're gonna flirt
with a motorcycle cop?

02:02.623 --> 02:07.292
Well, I'll start with flirting,
see where it goes.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.354
Okay, I'm gonna record this
because this is exactly

02:10.372 --> 02:13.023
the kind of thing that
my therapist does not believe.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.359
Oh, crap, it's a woman.

02:15.452 --> 02:17.636
-Katharine, unbutton your shirt.
-What?

02:17.863 --> 02:19.029
Maybe she's gay.

02:19.047 --> 02:20.881
I'm not gay.

02:21.033 --> 02:22.215
All right.

02:22.368 --> 02:24.868
Do you hear that, Dr. Bell?

02:24.887 --> 02:27.062
Do you hear that?!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.374
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:30.467 --> 02:32.317
♪<i> Nothing wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:33.320 --> 02:35.228
You're making a fuss
over nothing.

02:35.397 --> 02:38.565
You just got a ticket,
your license is expired,

02:38.717 --> 02:41.952
and you told that officer
I'm an adventurous lover.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.721
Why didn't you just
get it renewed?

02:44.723 --> 02:46.481
I didn't want them
to change my photo.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.501
That was a hair day
for the ages.

02:49.728 --> 02:51.319
Well, now, you're gonna have to
go to the DMV

02:51.338 --> 02:52.838
and take the driving test again.

02:53.065 --> 02:54.322
Can't you take it for me?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.508
We look about the same age.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.326
No.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.329
Although I do love me
some standardized tests.

03:01.423 --> 03:04.241
I used to give them
to myself in math club.

03:04.259 --> 03:06.334
I don't have time to go
to the DMV.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.413
Tomorrow's my nail appointment,
Thursday's my chemical peel.

03:09.506 --> 03:11.005
Wait, you know you can't
drive anywhere

03:11.025 --> 03:12.265
until you get this done, right?

03:12.434 --> 03:14.601
What is with you war
on beauty, Katharine?

03:15.863 --> 03:20.607
Don't you have any cool friends
I can buy a license from?

03:20.743 --> 03:21.700
No!

03:21.851 --> 03:24.203
'Cause breaking the law
is never cool,

03:24.354 --> 03:25.946
unless it involves
feeding a meter

03:26.098 --> 03:28.281
so a stranger doesn't get
a parking ticket.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.435
Take that,
Louisville Town Center.

03:31.453 --> 03:33.119
Well, if I can't drive myself,

03:33.272 --> 03:34.862
you'll have to
drive me everywhere.

03:35.031 --> 03:36.215
Not gonna happen.

03:36.442 --> 03:38.458
Why, are you busy
this week?

03:38.610 --> 03:43.263
Look at those glasses.
Of course you're not busy.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.875
I am so glad
I got glasses.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.286
I can finally see,

03:49.304 --> 03:53.398
and I can really emphasize
my point... like this.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.958
(laughs)

03:54.960 --> 03:56.643
Ooh, I love 'em, and I think
you look super sexy.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.221
Well, now that I can see,
I think you look super sexy.

04:00.241 --> 04:03.408
Okay, okay, I like
where this is going.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.661
And you just ruined it.

04:07.473 --> 04:10.249
Hey, y'all,
it's moonshine season.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.068
Who wants a jug
of Mama's skeeter juice?

04:14.162 --> 04:15.570
Isn't that the stuff
your cousin used

04:15.664 --> 04:17.163
to burn his fingerprints off?

04:17.316 --> 04:18.648
One and the same.

04:18.817 --> 04:21.985
It'll also take the roots
out of your sewer line.

04:22.004 --> 04:23.578
Oh, okay, well, sign me up.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.748
-So long, laser hair removal.
-I'll take two.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.934
I just found out my son's
production of<i> Pippin</i>

04:29.161 --> 04:31.177
isn't about Scottie.

04:31.330 --> 04:34.180
Mama is gonna be
so proud of me.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.182
I sold 'em all
and didn't even have to

04:36.277 --> 04:38.610
go to the high school
this year.

04:40.263 --> 04:42.839
I've got amazing news.

04:42.841 --> 04:44.674
You do? Hang on.

04:44.726 --> 04:46.176
I'm listening.

04:46.194 --> 04:49.103
One of my songs is gonna be
in a commercial.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.957
What?! That's amazing.
Which song?

04:52.108 --> 04:53.183
"Say No More."
The one about

04:53.201 --> 04:54.701
maybe meeting my dad someday.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.353
I love that song.

04:56.355 --> 04:58.371
♪ I<i> come home and I wonder</i> ♪

04:58.524 --> 05:01.633
BOTH:
♪<i> What was the journey for?</i> ♪

05:01.860 --> 05:03.393
♪<i> My dad just sips his whiskey</i> ♪

05:03.453 --> 05:06.546
♪<i> It's all right, son,</i>
<i> say no more.</i> ♪

05:06.698 --> 05:09.215
I can't wait to get drunk
with my son.

05:09.368 --> 05:11.493
What's the commercial about?

05:11.553 --> 05:13.645
No idea. It got bought by
one of those huge companies

05:13.797 --> 05:16.315
that makes everything from beer
to frozen pizza,

05:16.466 --> 05:19.133
but the important thing is
I'm gonna get<i> paid!</i>

05:19.153 --> 05:21.153
Ooh, I hear that.
New espresso machine

05:21.304 --> 05:24.047
coming our way, roomie. Yes!

05:24.216 --> 05:25.973
(phone ringing)

05:25.993 --> 05:27.233
Hello, Mother.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.810
Well, I hope you're happy.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.054
I've taken one of your
ride-share services,

05:31.147 --> 05:32.814
and now I'm being abducted.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.392
Ma'am, I promise you,
I'm not ab...

05:35.410 --> 05:38.378
I checked the box that said
"no conversation."

05:39.414 --> 05:41.656
Mother, no one is gonna
kidnap you.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.083
And if they do,
I assure you

05:43.235 --> 05:46.086
they will pay me
to take you back.

05:46.162 --> 05:48.071
Why are we going
through downtown?

05:48.073 --> 05:49.681
There's an accident on 64.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.575
I'm sure.

05:51.593 --> 05:55.762
Katharine, how do I use
that pepper spray you gave me?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.189
Oh, that's air freshener.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.191
I would never give you
a weapon. Bye!

05:59.342 --> 06:02.936
To Max and his messed up
relationship with his dad.

06:03.088 --> 06:04.437
And to Mama for once again

06:04.573 --> 06:06.756
outsmarting the po-po.

06:06.850 --> 06:08.658
(laughter)

06:10.687 --> 06:11.536
Ugh.

06:11.688 --> 06:13.430
Hoo-wee!

06:13.448 --> 06:16.116
So that's why people
make that noise.

06:16.268 --> 06:18.025
Can you believe
is was distilled

06:18.045 --> 06:21.296
in the same bathtub
I was born in?

06:26.128 --> 06:28.278
Okay, next question.
"Two vehicles arrive

06:28.296 --> 06:30.280
"at a four-way stop
at the same time.

06:30.373 --> 06:31.539
Who has the right of way?"

06:31.558 --> 06:34.134
Obviously, the most
expensive car.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.061
This is still America.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.788
The correct answer is
the car to your right.

06:38.807 --> 06:41.958
Unless you're in Detroit.
Don't ever stop in Detroit.

06:41.977 --> 06:43.309
Here's an easy one.

06:43.462 --> 06:47.889
"At what blood alcohol
concentration are you impaired?"

06:47.983 --> 06:49.315
Me personally?

06:49.468 --> 06:51.651
When I start telling people
I love them.

06:52.638 --> 06:55.472
I've never seen you that drunk.
Look, if you're not gonna

06:55.565 --> 06:57.490
take this seriously, there's
no way you're gonna pass.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.086
Oh, who cares? So I'm driving
on an expired license.

07:01.163 --> 07:03.146
What are they gonna do,
throw me in jail?

07:03.148 --> 07:05.081
That's exactly what
they're gonna do!

07:06.151 --> 07:07.150
And you know what they
have in jail?

07:07.169 --> 07:08.818
Florescent lighting.

07:08.912 --> 07:10.278
You don't scare me.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.172
I drove here today
and nothing happened.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.156
What?!

07:13.175 --> 07:14.491
That's right.

07:14.509 --> 07:17.160
And I solved the Wordle
at the same time.

07:17.179 --> 07:20.439
You can't drive
with an expired license.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.732
Watch me, four-eyes.

07:25.504 --> 07:28.521
Give me your keys.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.358
If you want my keys,
you'll have to take them.

07:32.511 --> 07:36.955
Dang, that made
my neck tingle.

07:37.106 --> 07:39.291
Yeah, she'll do fine in jail.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.943
I'm serious.
Give me your purse.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.187
-Let go.
-You let go.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.113
Don't hurt it, it's Gucci!

07:46.133 --> 07:47.799
Why can't you see
I am doing this

07:47.951 --> 07:49.801
for your own...

07:49.953 --> 07:53.096
good?

07:54.049 --> 07:56.683
Keys weren't even
in my purse.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.300
Dude, in less than two minutes,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.653
your song is gonna be
on national TV.

08:08.805 --> 08:10.155
And then two minutes after that,

08:10.382 --> 08:11.397
we're gonna watched
a masked celebrity

08:11.550 --> 08:13.325
dressed as a taco
singing "La Vida Loca."

08:13.510 --> 08:16.328
(laughs) Ooh. Get ready to be
on my Instagram Live, Max!

08:16.479 --> 08:19.389
Come on. You know I don't like
being the center of attention.

08:19.482 --> 08:21.315
Darren, grab me one of those
drinks that you named after me.

08:21.335 --> 08:26.004
Oh, one Max on the Beach
coming right up!

08:26.231 --> 08:27.731
You're practically famous.

08:27.749 --> 08:30.491
It would be like if Carter's
afro ever gets on<i> Is It Cake?</i>

08:30.660 --> 08:32.252
I've sent pictures in
four times.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.071
What are they so afraid of?

08:35.164 --> 08:39.092
My cousin Janice was on TV once,
but it was<i> Cops.</i>

08:39.244 --> 08:40.760
She wasn't wearing pants.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.729
We were so proud.

08:44.507 --> 08:45.524
Hey, hey, Instagram.

08:45.751 --> 08:48.434
We are live
with songwriter Max Kingbird.

08:48.587 --> 08:50.511
-What up, Gram?
-We're roomies, too.

08:50.605 --> 08:52.346
He ate my damn yogurt
this morning.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.533
Anyway, say something
to your fans.

08:54.684 --> 08:57.277
Hey, guys.
Uh, this song is about my dad.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.279
It really means a lot to me.

08:59.431 --> 09:01.373
I'm just so honored
that you all are gonna hear it.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.042
And if you're hot, single,
and in Louisville,

09:04.119 --> 09:06.044
we are getting hammered
on moonshine

09:06.195 --> 09:07.879
-at The Middle C.
-(whoops)

09:08.031 --> 09:11.941
He's kidding. We don't want
no Feds up in the holler.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.127
Wait. I think they're going
to a commercial break.

09:14.279 --> 09:17.038
Uh, quiet down, everybody.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.448
Can everybody please quiet down?

09:18.466 --> 09:21.226
-Hey, shut the hell up!
-(chatter stops)

09:22.287 --> 09:24.454
Oh, uh, I think they heard you

09:24.472 --> 09:27.232
'cause they were already
quieting from when I... said it.

09:27.459 --> 09:29.626
(intro to "Say No More" plays)

you to yoga and the hair salon.

18:33.354 --> 18:36.948
I'm pretty sure I'm still owed
a trip to Fuddruckers.
