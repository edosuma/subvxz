WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:06.110
The bosses have been distracted.
They are transporting something.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.270
He heard about the storage
warehouse.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.870
He says he has more information.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.230
He wants to meet me at eight.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.670
What do you want?

00:14.720 --> 00:18.270
Rini, if I had any other choice
I wouldn't be here.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.510
~ Do you know this man? Karl Sieg.
~ No.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.030
Perhaps you know someone who does?

00:24.080 --> 00:28.390
I wanted somewhere near the office
I could stay when I'm over.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.790
It's a beautiful little place
called Audresselles.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.230
Someone once told me... guilt,
it's like a cancer.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.350
You can treat the symptoms,
but never the cause.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.470
I've found some things out about
Vincent Bourg. He knows Ian Garrett.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.950
The two of them know each other.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.360
What?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.520 --> 01:21.590
Do you mind if I clean here, please?

01:21.640 --> 01:22.880
No, no, of course not.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.470
It's so peaceful here.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.120
Well, we try.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.230
So, you find that you are happy
here?

01:38.280 --> 01:40.760
I like to make sure
our guests are happy.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.270
Madam?

01:57.680 --> 01:59.470
~ Oh! ~ Voila!

01:59.520 --> 02:01.880
~ Thank you.
~ It's no trouble.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.990
You're French.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.229
Yes.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.280
I went to Paris once -
it wasn't for me.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.920
What brings you to Oxford?

02:17.360 --> 02:19.710
Just someone that I used to know.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.670
An old friend?

02:21.720 --> 02:25.440
No, not exactly. I don't even know
if he's alive any more...

02:26.760 --> 02:30.270
.. but I made him
a promise many years ago and...

02:30.320 --> 02:31.760
I intend to keep it.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.310
Well, you don't hear that
every day. Very noble.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.840
You are most kind.
But, no, I don't think so.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.480
Darling?

02:55.880 --> 02:57.800
Darling! Are you...?

03:00.840 --> 03:06.030
Ah, that's all I need, eh?
Another bloody day at the office.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.910
d Oh, my love

03:19.960 --> 03:23.670
d We pray each day

03:23.720 --> 03:27.350
d May you come home

03:27.400 --> 03:30.760
d And be OK

03:38.440 --> 03:41.110
d For now we'll wait

03:41.160 --> 03:42.470
d For you

03:42.520 --> 03:47.440
d For you to come home. d

04:02.800 --> 04:04.950
I don't know what you expect me
to do.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.670
Ian Garrett is a respected local
businessman.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.840
And he's connected to Vincent Bourg.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.750
What is your proof? A story?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.510
The exact same story
told the exact same way.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.950
I'm sorry,
but it doesn't make any sense.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.790
I mean, this guy is helping you.

04:20.839 --> 04:24.110
He has put up a lot of money to
encourage people to come forward.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.630
Someone I've never met turns up
and throws money at us,

04:26.680 --> 04:27.920
you've got to wonder why.

04:29.800 --> 04:36.870
You must know Mr Garrett experienced
a similar tragedy to your own.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.790
His daughter.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.830
I'm sure he felt an
emotional connection to your case.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.350
Listen, I'm not asking you to go out
and arrest him.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.910
I'm just asking you and Detective
Baptiste, please,

04:46.960 --> 04:49.390
to look into Garrett and see
if there's any connection

04:49.440 --> 04:51.480
between him and Vincent Bourg,
that's all.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.830
Listen, I cannot imagine what
you are both going through,

04:56.880 --> 05:00.800
but this... This is definitely not
the way to get your son back.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.110
Well, I... I think at the very least
it's worth looking into,

05:08.160 --> 05:11.070
even if there's a slightest
chance that there could be a lead.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.590
There is a lead. Detective Baptiste
is in Paris right now.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.150
I'm joining him today.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.520
What lead?

05:18.520 --> 05:20.470
What's in Paris?

05:20.520 --> 05:23.280
It's... too early to say.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.550
Course it is.
Thank you for your help. Come on.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.190
They can't expect us
to just sit back and do nothing.

05:31.240 --> 05:34.110
~ We just need to have a word with
Baptiste... ~ Give me the car keys.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.390
What?

05:35.440 --> 05:37.230
I need to speak to Vincent Bourg.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.190
Look, the police aren't going
to do anything.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.750
Mrs Hughes! Have the
police told you anything?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.110
Look, we're both so desperate
for the slightest thing,

05:44.160 --> 05:46.270
the smallest hope,
but if you accuse Ian Garrett

05:46.320 --> 05:47.950
he could withdraw the reward money.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.230
Em, I swear to you,
I heard what I heard,

05:50.280 --> 05:52.750
word for word, the exact same story,
told the exact same way

05:52.800 --> 05:55.230
by two people who claim to have
no knowledge of each other.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.920
Please. I have to try...

05:58.880 --> 06:00.120
.. for Olly.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.070
~ I'm going to drive. ~ No, no, no, no.
I'll do this on my own.
You should be back at the hotel.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.350
What, resting?
That's what everybody says.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.560
I'm not an invalid. I'll drive.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.590
How do you know he comes here?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.550
He comes here every day.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.240
Have you been following him?

06:31.240 --> 06:32.600
Tony...

06:34.280 --> 06:37.270
Right, I think
we should go back. I think...

06:37.320 --> 06:38.830
Wait here.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.960
Tony...

06:50.040 --> 06:51.120
Oi!

06:53.880 --> 06:55.590
What do you want from me?

06:55.640 --> 06:58.270
I already told you, I don't know
what happened to your son.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.070
~ Do you know Ian Garrett?
~ Leave me alone!

07:00.120 --> 07:02.400
~ Do you know Ian Garrett?
~ I'm calling the police.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.320
Please.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.240
Please, I didn't do anything.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.160
Ian Garrett's number.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.800
Tell me about Garrett!

07:39.840 --> 07:41.470
Leon called me.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.230
He told me he had
information about Oliver Hughes

07:45.280 --> 07:48.230
and, you know,
by the time I went to meet him...

07:48.280 --> 07:50.600
So, we've run his phone records.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.950
Shortly before calling me,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.950
Leon received a phone
call...

07:56.000 --> 07:57.560
from your brother.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.040
Eh?

08:04.960 --> 08:09.470
~ You think Martin... ~ Yes. ~ .. has
anything to do with

08:09.520 --> 08:11.400
some missing child?

08:12.720 --> 08:13.920
Yes.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.590
No... No way.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.030
OK.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.510
If the Caid had anything to do with
this child's disappearance,

08:22.560 --> 08:24.950
your brother will know.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.270
You think he told Leon?

08:26.320 --> 08:27.960
That is my hope.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.390
All I ask is that you meet
your brother

08:31.440 --> 08:34.440
and find out what
he told Leon about Oliver Hughes.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.030
Listen, myself and several other
officers will be close by.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.750
Once you spoken with Martin,

08:42.799 --> 08:45.790
we'll get you somewhere
far from here, somewhere safe.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.800
And then, I assure you,
I will not trouble you again.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.000
Bourg knows him.
He knows Ian Garrett.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.070
They've shared things....

09:23.120 --> 09:24.280
Material.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.670
Oh, God.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.710
Bourg's alibi was a lie.
Garrett paid for it.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.750
Garrett was worried that
if Bourg spent too long in police
custody, he'd start talking,

09:33.800 --> 09:37.390
~ reveal who the real Ian Garrett is.
~ I don't understand,
did Vincent Bourg take our son?

09:37.440 --> 09:40.400
He swears he didn't,
but he's terrified of Garrett.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.710
We need to talk to the police.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.230
No, I'm going to meet Garrett.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.750
He invited me to go and watch the
cup final with him,

09:52.800 --> 09:55.030
~ take my mind off things.
~ You're not going to go?

09:55.080 --> 09:57.670
Yeah, yeah.
He's coming to Chalons.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.110
We need to be sure.
We need to do these things properly.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.320
~ You can't just turn up and...
~ And what?

10:03.760 --> 10:06.510
And do whatever you just did to
Vincent Bourg.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.590
What did you do to him?
Look at you, you're shaking.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.790
We need to talk to the police
and we'll tell them...

10:12.840 --> 10:15.310
Why? You heard Mark,
they don't believe us.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.400
~ I want to go there now. ~ I need to
look Ian directly in the eye.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.510
Tony, please.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.550
I'm just going to talk to him.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.760
Go to the police if you want,
but I'm meeting Garrett.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.870
So these corridors will be just
over regulation width.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.200
Excuse me.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.990
Hello?

10:54.040 --> 10:57.360
It's me... Vincent.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.640
Tony Hughes...

11:03.720 --> 11:04.960
.. he knows.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.880
~ I see. ~ 'He beat me.'

11:10.760 --> 11:12.630
Thanks for telling me.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.000
You're not going to hurt her... right?

11:17.320 --> 11:21.000
You said you wouldn't
hurt my mother.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.920
And you said you'd
keep your mouth shut.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.880
'I'd rather not pay your mother
another visit.'

11:56.080 --> 11:57.240
Hey!

12:00.040 --> 12:02.200
Saved a seat for you.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.800
Got you a beer in, too.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.070
Probably a bit on the warm side now.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.840
Cheers.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.670
Thanks for coming all this way.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.070
This wee place is starting
to grow on me.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.510
~ How's it going? ~ 1-1.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.880
Zidane penalty, then Italian header.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.200
Pretty... cagey stuff.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.000
You all right, pal?

12:49.280 --> 12:51.520
I know what you are, Garrett.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.670
I know your wee secret.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.160
You shouldn't have gone after
Vincent Bourg.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.190
You're out of your depth, sunshine.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.320
Emily told them you paid for Vincent
Bourg's alibi.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.240
Better give that lawyer
friend of yours a call.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.960
No, Tony...

13:33.960 --> 13:36.190
I don't think so.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.750
I'm sorry, Mr Hughes, but we need
you to come to the station.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.190
You're under arrest for assault.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.510
What?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.910
Stand up, please.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.710
Don't be ridiculous.
It's not me you're after, it's him.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.110
Stand up, please.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.070
~ What are you talking about? ~ Please.
~ I'm not going anywhere.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.840
~ Mr Hughes, stand up.
~ No, get your hands get off me!

13:57.360 --> 14:00.550
~ It's not me, it's him you want!
~ I'm only trying to help you, Tony.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.000
It's not me you want!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.190
He knows Vincent Bourg!

14:05.240 --> 14:09.080
Garrett knows Bourg. What are you
doing with me? He's a paedophile!

14:13.560 --> 14:15.950
I thought you only want
information.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.270
This is for your protection.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.160
~ We need to know what's going
on inside. ~ Protection?

14:23.800 --> 14:26.750
When we left Romania, we had nothing.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
Didn't know where to go, what to do.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.840
We only had each other.
My brother looks after me.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.270
He will want to help me... and I go
in wearing this?

14:40.320 --> 14:42.710
The people he works for know you
were involved with

14:42.760 --> 14:45.350
an undercover police officer,

14:45.400 --> 14:48.400
so you will wear this.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.670
Let's go over the story once more.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.510
Leon told me about...

15:38.800 --> 15:41.920
.. a man called Karl Sieg.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.470
How he was involved
in Oliver Hughes' abduction.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.600
And then what do you say
to your brother?

15:51.920 --> 15:53.590
Then I say I have no money.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.200
I want to blackmail Karl Hughes.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.590
Sieg. It's Karl Sieg.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.200
~ Yes.
~ Sorry.

16:04.640 --> 16:08.950
I want to blackmail him,
I threaten him to go to the police.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.350
And?

16:10.400 --> 16:15.390
And I ask for the address,
for Karl Sieg's address,

16:15.440 --> 16:18.030
and I will split the money
with my brother.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.360
That's good.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.920
~ Karl Sieg. ~ Yes. ~ Oliver Hughes.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.280
Remember, we are not far away
and we have a man in the cafe.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.680
Are you ready?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.520
~ Vous desirez? ~ Un cafe.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.480
Bien, merci.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.760
Is there a problem?

18:09.720 --> 18:11.990
Sorry, doctor, it's
James Walsh, I'm his father.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.350
It's all right,
there's nothing to worry about.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.550
His ankle is broken
and he'll need a cast.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.830
A bad fall, but he'll be fine.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.350
We've got him on some painkillers
but it was quite a shock.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.200
~ He's been asking for you. ~ Thank you.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.920
Mum...

18:35.720 --> 18:38.830
~ Where's Mum? ~ She's on her way.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.160
~ You called her, right?
~ Yeah, I did.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.680
It's all right.
Mum'll be here soon, I promise.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.350
It's OK.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.590
It's OK.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.040
It's just a fright, that's all.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.920
It'll be all right now.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.350
There must be someone else who can
help us find Karl Sieg.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.720
No-one who's talking.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.920
So we bring her brother
in ourselves.

19:32.760 --> 19:36.030
Why would a prominent member
of the Caids de Cite speak to us?

19:36.080 --> 19:39.920
There is no reason to help.
Our best chance is Rini.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.110
But what we are asking her to do is
hard and it's dangerous.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.040
~ We cannot compel her
if she is afraid. ~ So what do we do?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.670
Karl Sieg's a ghost. There isn't
a single trace left of him.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.790
I know.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.990
Et voila.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.000
Sorry. Celia loves to text.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.630
Why we cannot simply pick up
the phone and talk escapes me.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.110
Is she still in Chalons?

20:07.160 --> 20:10.880
No, she returned home.
Our daughter will have moved on.

20:13.880 --> 20:18.120
Sarah, my daughter, she's an addict.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.870
From time to time,
she returns to our home.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.910
Sometimes she breaks in and steals.

20:25.960 --> 20:30.630
Other times,
she... she tries to... threaten?

20:30.680 --> 20:34.520
No, bully. She will bully my wife
into just giving her money.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.800
All of this is my fault.
I am at a loss.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.310
No, please, no.
You can't leave now.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.790
I am no use to you here.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.470
If you turn around and run away then
you're no use to anyone.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.110
~ Please, let us sit and talk.
~ There's nothing to talk about!

20:58.160 --> 20:59.630
Do you want to talk about this?

20:59.680 --> 21:02.880
Hmm? The police were outside
last time also...

21:04.680 --> 21:06.400
.. and yet I almost bled to death.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.870
I understand how much you
want to find your son.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.560
No, you don't.
If you leave you don't.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.280
I'm sorry...

21:17.800 --> 21:18.910
I need to go.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.150
~ I need to make a life.
~ No, no, wait wait wait! Listen!

21:21.200 --> 21:24.270
~ Let me go! ~ You owe Julien!
Without him, you'd have no life.

21:24.320 --> 21:28.510
~ Tony, stop, get a hold of
yourself. ~ I have no life! ~ Please.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.200
Fine! Go home. Enjoy your life.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.120
Voulez-vous une cigarette?

22:46.160 --> 22:48.350
~ No. I'm, uh... I'm fine. Thanks.
~ English?

22:48.400 --> 22:49.720
Irish.

22:51.200 --> 22:55.160
Something about Irish people's
face that just gives them away, no?

22:57.720 --> 22:59.480
Eyebrows maybe?

23:05.520 --> 23:06.760
What about you?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.790
~ What do you do? ~ Me?

23:10.840 --> 23:12.160
I'm...

23:19.280 --> 23:21.640
I'm Tony. Tony Hughes.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.160
Monique Pelletier.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.910
Listen, I don't care what
happens to me.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.950
What is important is that Bourg
admitted to me that he knows
Garrett.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.990
Emily was on her way over here to
tell Mark... Detective Walsh.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.310
Ian Garrett paid for Bourg's alibi.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.390
Mr Hughes, two witnesses
identified Monsieur Bourg

24:19.440 --> 24:20.750
and provided an alibi.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.190
We cannot simply ignore that just
because you say so.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.790
All I am asking is that you take a
look!

24:26.840 --> 24:30.230
And I am sure Detective
Baptiste will consider

24:30.280 --> 24:33.240
every angle of investigation
once he is back from Paris.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.640
I'd like to call my wife now,
please.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.070
Sure.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.390
~ Tony? ~ 'Hi.'

24:54.440 --> 24:55.630
Where the hell are you?

24:55.680 --> 24:57.550
I need you to do something for me.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.080
There's someone you need to find.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.350
What? Who?

25:02.400 --> 25:04.400
'You need to get on a train to
London.'

25:17.160 --> 25:18.280
Here?

25:22.280 --> 25:23.440
Who is the other guy?

25:25.560 --> 25:27.760
She said her brother would
come alone.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.230
What's he saying?

25:55.280 --> 25:58.200
He tells her a lot of people
are looking for her.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.320
She says, "What did you say to Leon
when you called him?"

26:17.000 --> 26:20.510
She shouldn't be talking about
Oliver already - it's too quick.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.800
If we pull her out of there, we lose
our last chance to find Oliver.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.320
Julien.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.470
Rini! Rini!

26:53.520 --> 26:55.080
Hang on.

27:41.280 --> 27:45.920
Georges said it was all right
if I come in and see you.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.360
He's a mate, so...

28:06.600 --> 28:08.560
I had a dog once when I was a boy.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.870
His name was Snowy,
he was a mongrel...

28:14.920 --> 28:19.280
even though he only had a wee
splash of white on his neck.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.800
I was a big Tintin fan, me.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.400
He was a timid thing, Snowy.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.430
Jump at his own shadow.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.400
He was a big bastard,
but he was timid.

28:38.440 --> 28:42.110
And one night,
during a thunderstorm,

28:42.160 --> 28:43.840
he got himself all riled up.

28:45.240 --> 28:49.400
And... a neighbour came by,
his power had gone out.

28:51.600 --> 28:55.360
And when I opened the door,
Snowy went for him...

28:56.840 --> 28:58.320
.. took a chunk out of his leg.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.040
Gentlest dog in the world, I swear.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.720
But he was scared.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.560
He wasn't thinking.

29:16.600 --> 29:20.550
So, he had to be put down.

29:20.600 --> 29:25.360
even though... the poor fella was
trying to protect me.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.640
Lashing out in your state is only
going to get you hurt, son.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.280
Where were you the night
Olly went missing?

29:54.400 --> 29:56.280
Working late, as usual.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.480
It's true, I promise.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.080
All I'm doing is trying to help you.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.440
Your daughter, Molly.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.760
She didn't just walk out of
the house that night, did she?

30:16.560 --> 30:20.040
You be very careful what you
say about my Molly.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.440
You took her, didn't you?

30:26.400 --> 30:27.520
Cos you're sick.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.000
I'm sorry it's come to this, Tony.

30:35.320 --> 30:38.280
That dog of yours had to be put down
cos it was a dangerous animal...

30:39.680 --> 30:42.240
.. in case it might have hurt someone
else.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.880
Dangerous animals like you need to
be put down, Ian.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.360
That's as may be...

30:52.520 --> 30:53.800
.. but...

30:55.680 --> 30:59.880
.. I'm not the one in the pound right
now, am I, sunshine?

31:14.840 --> 31:18.280
We made up a place where the boy
was supposed to be...

31:21.600 --> 31:23.200
.. and we only told Leon.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.360
Some buildings in a field,
outside of Lille...

31:31.840 --> 31:36.240
.. and a camera was placed
there to see who came.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.640
So, the call to Leon about Oliver...

31:46.480 --> 31:47.800
.. the location...

31:51.120 --> 31:53.240
You knew nothing of his whereabouts?

31:55.160 --> 32:00.280
You... You fed my friend with lies
to draw him out?

32:03.040 --> 32:04.840
This was just a ploy to kill him?

32:09.280 --> 32:11.920
We... We had to flush out the rat.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.840
What about the man who ran away?

32:26.240 --> 32:27.680
We need to speak with him.

32:29.120 --> 32:32.520
Talk. Talk. Talk!

32:35.400 --> 32:37.400
Do you really think I will tell you?

32:38.760 --> 32:40.270
You have to.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.360
After what happened to Leon?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.400
And to my sister?

32:50.360 --> 32:51.720
No way.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.640
Would you like some cream? Milk?

33:26.120 --> 33:29.350
Me neither. I have some, though,
for when guests come

33:29.400 --> 33:32.760
~ and I have some biscuits in the
cupboard... ~ No, I'm fine, thanks.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.350
So...

33:41.400 --> 33:43.350
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.910
Emily.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.750
And you're a friend of Ian's?

33:46.800 --> 33:48.040
An acquaintance.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.790
You haven't been
reading the papers lately?

33:58.840 --> 34:02.470
Oh, no. I find them
much too upsetting.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.910
Are you sure you
wouldn't like to have a biscuit?

34:04.960 --> 34:06.830
They'll go stale soon, so...

34:06.880 --> 34:08.120
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.320
I wanted to
talk to you about Ian, actually.

34:17.679 --> 34:20.110
Oh, I haven't seen him in a while.

34:20.159 --> 34:23.550
He's always away on business,
you know? He's a very busy man.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.550
And when he's not doing
a build for other people,

34:26.600 --> 34:29.760
he's working on our summer place in
Audresselles.

34:38.800 --> 34:44.159
This stain just won't give.
Honestly... I've tried everything.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.150
I tell you what doesn't work
is white wine.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.070
That's one old wives' tale...

34:50.120 --> 34:54.070
A week ago, my son,
Oliver, went missing.

34:54.120 --> 34:57.120
I was on holiday with my husband
and he was taken.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.280
Oh, dear. That must have...

35:03.960 --> 35:06.160
My goodness, how awful.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.680
You had something similar
happen to you too, didn't you?

35:18.680 --> 35:19.920
Yes.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.960
Molly.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.880
It was a long time ago.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.070
What has any of this got
to do with me?

35:43.120 --> 35:47.040
~ I'm not sure I... ~ When your daughter
went missing, did they question Ian?

35:48.400 --> 35:50.670
Did they...?

35:50.720 --> 35:52.030
Get out.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.190
I'm only asking if they questioned
him.

35:54.240 --> 35:58.680
~ Will you leave my house now,
please, Mrs Hughes? ~ I...

36:15.040 --> 36:19.440
I'm sorry, but I never told you that
Hughes was my surname, Mrs Garrett.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.270
You know who I am,
don't you? Don't you?

36:24.320 --> 36:26.600
So why are you lying to me? Why?

36:39.960 --> 36:41.440
I'll see myself out.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.830
Em? I'm out, finally.

37:15.880 --> 37:19.070
'I found her, like you asked.
I spoke to Mary Garrett.'

37:19.120 --> 37:21.400
~ OK?
~ 'I'm fine.

37:22.720 --> 37:25.070
'There's something not quite right.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.270
'It's like she's not all there.'

37:27.320 --> 37:28.510
I don't know think that her

37:28.560 --> 37:31.030
and Ian have even
seen each other for a while.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.630
She said that he's either
always away working

37:33.680 --> 37:35.950
or in Audresselles
working on the summer home.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.510
And when I asked her if Ian had ever
been questioned, about Molly,

37:40.560 --> 37:43.790
'she practically threw me
out the door,

37:43.840 --> 37:45.280
'like she's hiding something.'

37:47.360 --> 37:49.270
What time's your train get in?

37:49.320 --> 37:51.680
~ 'Six.'
~ I'll pick you up.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.640
I could stare at this for ever.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.920
It won't go away though, will it?
Wherever we go.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.080
But we got away, didn't we?
And we're together...

38:20.720 --> 38:21.960
.. just like you wanted.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.240
It's not what I want.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.430
I think you might have had
one too many.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.120
Maybe you need a wee lie down.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.360
Don't ever talk down to me.
Don't you dare...

38:35.360 --> 38:36.760
.. not after what you did.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.960
And not just to Molly, to...

38:43.120 --> 38:45.800
You're right, doll.
You're right. I'm sorry.

38:47.080 --> 38:51.360
Not many wives out there would keep
a secret like you did.

38:54.320 --> 38:58.760
But we came here to disappear...

39:00.920 --> 39:02.240
.. to put it all behind us.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.240
You need to start trying to let
go...

39:11.080 --> 39:12.280
We both do.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.680
Till death us do part, right?

39:31.280 --> 39:34.400
Aye. Death us do part.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.840
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.790
Um... my phone ran out of battery.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.440
I thought you were leaving.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.440
Thank you.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.920
Do you think he'll believe her?

41:37.280 --> 41:39.760
Rini's brother is a criminal,
a greedy one.

41:45.880 --> 41:51.830
Greedy men like him believe that
all around them are greedy also.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.750
Rini, don't do this...

43:18.800 --> 43:22.760
Karl Sieg goes by the name
Andre Touloux. He's in Brussels.

43:24.240 --> 43:27.600
Good. We have what we came for.
Now put the knife down.

43:29.760 --> 43:34.320
Don't ruin what you have built
all these years.

43:35.720 --> 43:40.120
Hurting your brother will never
stop haunting you.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.000
Laissez la passer.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.120
Rini?

44:17.760 --> 44:20.870
Did he tell you?

44:20.920 --> 44:22.440
We know where Karl Sieg is.

49:43.240 --> 49:47.310
~ You've got it wrong.
~ Where is he?

49:47.360 --> 49:49.470
Wait, it's not... It's not what
you think.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.590
Is this him on here?

49:51.640 --> 49:52.790
Is this Olly?

49:52.840 --> 49:55.680
I wouldn't look at that, son,
if I were you.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.520
I wouldn't look.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.920
Oh, God.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.950
Like I told you.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.800
It's not him.

50:18.440 --> 50:20.880
How many other tapes
are there like this?

50:22.760 --> 50:24.160
I don't know.

50:27.560 --> 50:29.560
I never took your boy here.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.880
I swear, I never even met him.

50:36.400 --> 50:42.030
So you contacted me out of the blue,
offering me money,

50:42.080 --> 50:44.360
out of the goodness of your heart?

50:50.480 --> 50:55.670
I've done bad things, Tony...

50:55.720 --> 50:59.640
and they eat away at me.

51:01.120 --> 51:05.360
You ever hear about those
billionaire philanthropists?

51:06.760 --> 51:11.480
People who hit the rich list and
then they decide to do their bit?

51:15.920 --> 51:17.790
You think they're saints?

51:17.840 --> 51:25.110
You think they don't do it
because of some niggling guilt?

51:25.160 --> 51:28.870
All the necks they've stood on
to get where they are.

51:28.920 --> 51:33.360
You don't get to the top without
making a mess along the way.

51:34.640 --> 51:37.830
There's no such thing as human
kindness.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.790
You're a rapist.

51:40.840 --> 51:43.230
You're a murderer.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.550
You're a paedophile.

51:45.600 --> 51:49.320
Why should I believe you didn't do
to my own son what you did
to your own daughter?

51:54.320 --> 51:56.400
Molly was a mistake.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.440
I didn't want to...

52:06.920 --> 52:10.560
It just... It just happened.

52:14.280 --> 52:16.560
I'm calling the police.

52:20.120 --> 52:22.800
You're going to confess
everything you've done...

52:24.080 --> 52:27.640
.. and then you're going to tell them
what you've done with my son.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.080
53.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.670
~ What? ~ Tapes. You asked how many
tapes.

52:40.720 --> 52:42.040
53.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.360
No.

52:51.920 --> 52:53.960
Where are they?

53:14.600 --> 53:16.360
It's not my fault.

53:18.240 --> 53:20.400
My grandad...

53:22.640 --> 53:26.800
.. used to come into my bed...

53:29.960 --> 53:32.670
.. every night.

53:32.720 --> 53:34.480
And he would...

53:39.680 --> 53:41.920
He would...

53:46.240 --> 53:49.470
.. to me and my brother...

53:49.520 --> 53:50.990
Shut up!

53:51.040 --> 53:53.070
Where is he? Where's my son?

53:53.120 --> 53:55.720
Where's my boy?

53:56.880 --> 53:59.800
If you want revenge, Tony...

54:03.480 --> 54:05.080
.. I'm here.

54:06.120 --> 54:08.760
I never touched your boy, I swear.

54:14.920 --> 54:17.560
He was beautiful though, wasn't he?

54:20.400 --> 54:23.000
Argh!

54:54.600 --> 54:57.430
There's someone here to see you,
Mrs Garrett.

54:57.480 --> 55:01.190
It would be nice
to say hello to them, wouldn't it?

55:01.240 --> 55:03.080
They've come a long way.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.870
Can she hear me?

55:06.920 --> 55:08.870
I'm not sure.

55:08.920 --> 55:12.200
Most of the time she just
stares out the window.

55:21.280 --> 55:25.270
Occasionally she'll offer up
something or she talks to herself.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.120
Sweet lady.

55:32.280 --> 55:36.000
Go on, speak to her,
I think she likes it.

55:54.840 --> 55:58.350
Many years ago,
your husband threatened the only

55:58.400 --> 56:01.480
person in the world that really
cared for me.

56:05.120 --> 56:08.680
He told me he would
take my mother's life if I spoke...

56:10.400 --> 56:15.280
.. and I swore that one day
I would get retribution for this.

56:17.800 --> 56:22.320
I would tell everyone he ever loved
what kind of monster he really was.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.280
But I can see I'm too late.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.960
Obviously you too
are a victim of this man.

57:15.360 --> 57:18.960
I have been so angry for so long...

57:20.400 --> 57:24.240
.. at your husband, at the world.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.840
Perhaps it is better
simply to let go...

57:33.680 --> 57:38.630
.. not to dwell on the choices
we have made,

57:38.680 --> 57:42.240
whether we should have gone
this way or another...

57:52.840 --> 57:56.600
Instead we should always go
forward...

58:00.960 --> 58:04.480
.. and try not to get
trapped in the past.

58:21.720 --> 58:25.160
d I got a kind-hearted woman

58:26.360 --> 58:29.040
d Do anything in this world for me

58:33.520 --> 58:37.310
d I got a kind-hearted woman

58:37.360 --> 58:40.080
d Do anything in this world for me

58:44.520 --> 58:47.870
d But these evil-hearted women

58:47.920 --> 58:50.880
d They will not let me be
