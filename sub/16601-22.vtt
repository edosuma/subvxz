WEBVTT

00:04.609 --> 00:06.141
Super? What's going on?

00:06.143 --> 00:07.876
One of my tenants, Mrs. Kramer,

00:07.878 --> 00:09.812
didn't walk her dog
this morning.

00:09.814 --> 00:10.846
That unusual?

00:10.848 --> 00:12.381
8:00 a.m. every day,
like clockwork.

00:12.383 --> 00:13.415
You knock on her door?

00:13.417 --> 00:14.450
Yeah, no answer.

00:14.452 --> 00:16.218
I figured I should
give you guys a call.

00:16.219 --> 00:17.486
You did the right thing.

00:21.058 --> 00:22.458
Mrs. Kramer.

00:24.095 --> 00:25.861
Open it.

00:31.002 --> 00:32.268
Hello?

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.456 --> 00:54.523
Central, I got a DOA
at this location,

00:54.525 --> 00:55.591
apparent homicide.

00:55.593 --> 00:59.295
Have a patrol supervisor
and squad respond.

01:00.831 --> 01:02.331
This is the
fourth vicious murder

01:02.333 --> 01:04.433
of an elderly victim
in the past month,

01:04.435 --> 01:06.302
in two adjoining precincts.

01:06.304 --> 01:08.203
Sid, what ties this
to one actor?

01:08.205 --> 01:10.606
M.E. says they all died
from blunt force trauma.

01:10.608 --> 01:13.542
Some kind of hammer or
tire iron, it looks like.

01:13.544 --> 01:14.743
Looks like?

01:14.745 --> 01:16.111
Well, like Garrett says,
vicious.

01:16.113 --> 01:17.813
Forensics hasn't gotten
a good impression

01:17.815 --> 01:18.947
for all the gore.

01:18.949 --> 01:20.716
And a million surveillance
cameras in the city,

01:20.718 --> 01:22.918
and we don't have
a single frame to point us?

01:22.920 --> 01:24.787
Not as of yet. This last one

01:24.789 --> 01:27.289
looks like the perp
gained access as a delivery guy.

01:27.291 --> 01:28.624
And we know that because?

01:28.626 --> 01:29.658
We know that because

01:29.660 --> 01:30.826
he buzzed some other tenants

01:30.828 --> 01:32.561
saying he had flowers for 1-H.

01:32.563 --> 01:33.929
So they just buzzed him in?

01:33.931 --> 01:36.265
Flowers for an old lady
who lived alone.

01:36.267 --> 01:39.635
And what is it you need me for?

01:39.637 --> 01:40.969
Are we calling this
a serial killer?

01:40.971 --> 01:42.338
What difference does it make
what we call it?

01:42.340 --> 01:43.872
The press already is.

01:43.874 --> 01:46.875
But we have it, and I'm getting
that kind of semantics pushback.

01:50.448 --> 01:52.748
Sir? Whatever it is, no.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.950
Your father.

01:54.952 --> 01:56.552
Hey, Pop.

01:56.554 --> 01:59.154
Sorry to barge in, Francis.
Sid, Garrett.

01:59.156 --> 02:00.456
Good to see you, Commissioner.

02:00.458 --> 02:01.990
What's going on?

02:01.992 --> 02:03.759
My RDNY breakfast
was just down the block.

02:03.761 --> 02:06.428
That's the Retired
Detectives of New York.

02:06.430 --> 02:07.830
Yeah, I hope it went well,
but we're kind of

02:07.832 --> 02:08.864
in the middle of something.

02:08.866 --> 02:09.965
I know what you're
in the middle of.

02:09.967 --> 02:13.335
The latest victim, Joan Kramer,

02:13.337 --> 02:15.104
was Jimmy Falco's sister-in-law.

02:15.106 --> 02:17.506
His wife is now in mourning,

02:17.508 --> 02:19.274
and Jimmy sent me up here
to ask you guys

02:19.276 --> 02:21.443
just how close you are
to catching this animal.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.680
We're nowhere.

02:24.682 --> 02:27.015
This guy is preying on
our most vulnerable citizens.

02:27.017 --> 02:28.751
And being one of them,
who just happens

02:28.753 --> 02:31.253
to have enough juice
to walk into this office,

02:31.255 --> 02:35.557
I came up here to say...
catch the son of a bitch.

02:41.265 --> 02:43.098
What do we got?

02:43.100 --> 02:44.466
Front for a local drug ring.

02:44.468 --> 02:45.868
Smoke-eaters say
it was firebomb.

02:45.870 --> 02:47.669
Pretty big one,
by the looks of it.

02:47.671 --> 02:49.271
Brought out 11 bodies so far.

02:49.273 --> 02:51.540
FDNY says they blocked the exit
before they torched it.

02:51.542 --> 02:52.808
Blocked the exit?

02:52.810 --> 02:54.910
Somebody's making a statement.

02:56.614 --> 02:57.980
Look at this.

03:01.385 --> 03:03.385
Detectives.

03:04.088 --> 03:06.321
Special Agent Veronica Molina.

03:06.323 --> 03:07.423
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

03:07.425 --> 03:08.791
What brings the feds
down to our fair city?

03:08.793 --> 03:11.160
I'm leading a DEA
field division team

03:11.162 --> 03:13.328
investigating Mano Sangriento.

03:13.330 --> 03:14.296
Mexican drug cartel?

03:14.298 --> 03:15.697
Thought this was
more a local beef.

03:15.699 --> 03:17.065
The individuals in that bar

03:17.067 --> 03:19.802
distributed heroin
for the cartel.

03:19.804 --> 03:22.638
This is how Mano Sangriento
settles business disputes.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.140
You're aware that the NYPD
has a narcotics bureau, right?

03:25.142 --> 03:27.876
That's had limited success.
That's why we're here.

03:27.878 --> 03:29.812
Well, this is
a multiple homicide.

03:29.814 --> 03:31.079
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

03:31.081 --> 03:34.283
We're expecting a
major heroin shipment,

03:34.285 --> 03:36.434
due to arrive
in New York any day.

03:36.458 --> 03:37.520
And?

03:37.521 --> 03:39.388
I'd like copies of all reports
related to this crime.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.789
Long as you give us
everything you got

03:40.791 --> 03:42.090
on Mano Sangriento, too.

03:42.092 --> 03:44.960
I'm afraid that information
is classified.

03:44.962 --> 03:46.462
That's the best you can do?

03:46.464 --> 03:48.497
Appreciate your cooperation,
Detectives.

03:48.499 --> 03:50.299
Same to you.

03:50.301 --> 03:52.801
Since when do the feds
run an operation in this city

03:52.803 --> 03:54.102
without including the NYPD?

03:54.104 --> 03:56.872
Since never, we got
something to say about it.

04:20.334 --> 04:22.321
<i>We have solid Intel</i>

04:22.323 --> 04:24.416
that the cartel's
next shipment will arrive

04:24.417 --> 04:26.918
in the next 48 hours.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.187
Are you lost, Detectives?

04:29.189 --> 04:31.088
No, but maybe you
didn't get the memo.

04:31.090 --> 04:32.957
Chief of detectives
spoke to your boss,

04:32.959 --> 04:35.459
and we're on the team now.

04:38.498 --> 04:40.364
We'll see about this.

04:40.366 --> 04:43.000
Suit yourself, but you don't
want to play ball with us,

04:43.002 --> 04:44.969
PD doesn't play ball
with the Agency.

04:44.971 --> 04:46.537
Sit.

04:46.539 --> 04:48.206
We'll stand.

04:49.375 --> 04:52.243
Our top priority
will be ascertaining

04:52.245 --> 04:54.078
where and when
the shipment will arrive,

04:54.080 --> 04:55.980
and formulating
an interdiction plan.

04:55.982 --> 04:58.216
So, we are monitoring
the leaders of several

04:58.218 --> 05:00.151
- local drug organizations...
- Excuse me.

05:00.153 --> 05:01.485
Danny.

05:01.487 --> 05:02.787
Don't mean to interrupt.

05:02.789 --> 05:06.490
But if you want to track
a shipment into this city,

05:06.492 --> 05:07.758
you shouldn't start
with the bosses.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.093
You start with
the low-level guys,

05:09.095 --> 05:11.095
you know, the hand-to-hand
guys on the street.

05:11.097 --> 05:15.032
With all due respect,
NYPD procedure has failed

05:15.034 --> 05:17.301
to stop this cartel,
so we'll be adhering

05:17.303 --> 05:20.271
to DEA protocol on this one.

05:29.315 --> 05:31.282
I'm not trying to
jam you up, Alex.

05:31.284 --> 05:32.617
I just need some information.

05:32.619 --> 05:34.385
I don't know anything
about those old people

05:34.387 --> 05:35.753
who got killed, though.

05:35.755 --> 05:36.988
Okay, but anything
you've heard could help.

05:36.990 --> 05:39.724
Look, I had something,
I'd tell you, I swear.

05:39.726 --> 05:40.925
Can I go?

05:40.927 --> 05:43.261
Yeah, I can't keep you.

05:45.031 --> 05:46.097
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:46.099 --> 05:47.565
You cutting him loose?

05:47.567 --> 05:48.866
He doesn't know anything.

05:50.436 --> 05:52.970
You got that from a few
softball questions, did you?

05:52.972 --> 05:54.739
I know that kid.
He's got a drug problem,

05:54.741 --> 05:56.107
but he's basically
a straight shooter.

05:56.109 --> 05:57.608
We got marching orders
to shake this precinct

05:57.610 --> 05:59.443
by the throat till
the perp falls out.

05:59.445 --> 06:01.145
I know that,
but throwing guys like Alex

06:01.147 --> 06:03.281
up against the wall won't help;
He'll just shut down.

06:03.283 --> 06:04.615
We're not shrinks, Reagan.

06:04.617 --> 06:05.750
You got to put the
fear of God in 'em.

06:05.752 --> 06:07.451
You got to get in their face.

06:07.453 --> 06:08.786
I don't abuse the citizens.

06:08.788 --> 06:10.888
The citizens? Yeah.

06:12.692 --> 06:14.425
You know, I know
your brother Danny.

06:14.427 --> 06:15.359
Hell of a detective.

06:15.361 --> 06:16.827
If you were more like him,

06:16.829 --> 06:19.463
maybe you wouldn't still
be walking a beat.

06:26.472 --> 06:29.240
What are you hearing, Baez?

06:30.710 --> 06:33.477
Talking about soccer...
Monterrey versus Santos.

06:33.479 --> 06:35.212
Yeah, this is a waste of time.

06:35.214 --> 06:36.247
Jose Pena is

06:36.249 --> 06:37.848
the cartel's top guy
in New York.

06:37.850 --> 06:39.684
He's got to know where
the shipment's coming in.

06:39.686 --> 06:42.119
And he's got to know better
than to chat about it

06:42.121 --> 06:43.721
over enchiladas. Danny...

06:43.723 --> 06:45.328
I'm just saying,
he's got to know

06:45.329 --> 06:46.695
the place is wired.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.661
Molina said to monitor Pena.
What choice do we have?

06:49.831 --> 06:50.762
Well, we have options.

06:50.763 --> 06:52.696
What's Carlos doing here?
Well, you want to find out

06:52.698 --> 06:54.031
where the shipment's
coming in from, right?

06:54.033 --> 06:56.478
Molina told us to monitor Pena.

06:56.479 --> 06:57.479
Molina's not here.

06:59.271 --> 07:00.371
How you doing, Carlos?

07:00.373 --> 07:01.805
Why we got to meet here?

07:01.807 --> 07:03.540
That's Pena's place right there.
I know it is.

07:03.542 --> 07:04.808
Okay, just relax.

07:04.810 --> 07:06.844
Look, he sees me talking to you,
I'm a dead man.

07:06.846 --> 07:08.045
Those guys don't play around.

07:08.047 --> 07:10.014
You work for Pena
and the cartel?

07:10.016 --> 07:11.048
Look, I go where the money is.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.249
Those guys are
on the streets right now.

07:12.251 --> 07:13.550
We hear there's
some serious weight

07:13.552 --> 07:15.219
coming in from Mexico.

07:15.221 --> 07:17.354
Supply and demand, bro.
We need the where and the when.

07:17.356 --> 07:18.989
Do you know what the
Mano Sangriento does to rats?

07:18.991 --> 07:20.624
They cut you up in little pieces

07:20.626 --> 07:22.126
and send them to your family.

07:22.128 --> 07:23.761
Yeah, well, I'm sure your family
would enjoy a reunion.

07:23.763 --> 07:25.329
Screw you, Danny! Hey!

07:25.331 --> 07:27.531
Hey!

07:27.533 --> 07:30.601
You'd be looking at serious time
if it wasn't for us.

07:30.603 --> 07:32.603
Now, get in and close the door.

07:34.907 --> 07:36.807
Come on, start talking.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.944
I told you to monitor
Pena's headquarters,

07:41.946 --> 07:43.546
not reach out
to a confidential informant.

07:43.548 --> 07:46.048
Yeah, but our guy came up
with the information you need

07:46.050 --> 07:47.249
on the heroin shipment.

07:47.251 --> 07:48.751
Which by now is
probably obsolete.

07:48.753 --> 07:50.052
Why?

07:50.054 --> 07:52.555
Your CI likely reached out to
Pena about your solicitations.

07:52.557 --> 07:55.291
Hey, our CI is solid, okay?
He wouldn't do that.

07:55.293 --> 07:56.692
We've been tracking
Mano Sangriento

07:56.694 --> 07:58.160
for two and a half years.

07:58.162 --> 08:00.763
No street-level informant
has crossed them yet.

08:00.765 --> 08:02.865
Maybe you've been using
the wrong informants.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.334
Exactly. I mean, there's
a reason they brought us in here

08:05.336 --> 08:07.303
on the team, because
we know the local players.

08:07.305 --> 08:09.739
And this team only exists
because your department's

08:09.741 --> 08:11.607
been unable to bring
down this cartel.

08:11.609 --> 08:12.875
Hey, take it easy, all right?

08:12.877 --> 08:14.977
You happen to be in the safest
big city in the country.

08:14.979 --> 08:17.113
That may be true,
but I still have orders

08:17.115 --> 08:19.048
to bring down
Mano Sangriento's operation.

08:19.050 --> 08:21.851
And we just gave you
what you needed to do it.

08:21.853 --> 08:24.120
Now, are you gonna
act on it or not?

08:24.122 --> 08:26.389
I'll secure the warrant.

08:26.391 --> 08:27.690
Good.

08:27.692 --> 08:30.059
But your guy better be right.

08:34.198 --> 08:38.299
Look, I promise, I swear,
I am not holding out on you.

08:38.302 --> 08:40.202
You know this
neighborhood cold, Alex.

08:40.203 --> 08:41.504
People are getting butchered.

08:41.506 --> 08:42.605
I don't know anything
about that, you know.

08:42.607 --> 08:43.972
Somebody saw something.

08:43.975 --> 08:47.076
Who else was out dealing around
the time of the murder?

08:47.078 --> 08:49.945
Police! Help! Police! Police!

08:49.947 --> 08:51.213
Hey, calm down.
I'm a cop. What's up?

08:51.215 --> 08:53.182
My name is Evan Fleming.
I live around the corner.

08:53.184 --> 08:54.650
I-I heard a commotion
in the courtyard,

08:54.652 --> 08:56.686
so I ran down and found them.
Found who?

08:56.688 --> 08:58.621
An elderly couple. They're
just lying in the courtyard.

08:58.623 --> 09:00.589
It looks really bad.
Let's go. Show me, show me.

09:22.780 --> 09:24.413
Did you see who did this?

09:24.415 --> 09:26.115
It was too dark.
I-I heard screams.

09:26.117 --> 09:28.398
W-When I opened my window,
I-I heard someone running away.

09:29.954 --> 09:33.055
Are they, are they dead?

09:34.492 --> 09:37.026
Hey, shield number 60538.
I got two DOA.

09:39.964 --> 09:41.931
Two precincts...

09:41.933 --> 09:43.165
four weeks,

09:43.167 --> 09:44.567
six dead!

09:45.837 --> 09:47.103
And you have nothing.

09:47.105 --> 09:48.771
Not nothing,
but we don't have the perp.

09:48.773 --> 09:49.739
That's nothing, Frank.

09:49.741 --> 09:52.408
Yet. We don't have him yet.

09:52.410 --> 09:54.243
So it is a "him." You have that?
Yes.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.444
Well, that narrows it down.

09:55.446 --> 09:58.080
Cut it out.

09:58.082 --> 10:00.182
Frank, I can't sell my public
on a "yet."

10:00.184 --> 10:02.752
And you can't hide behind "yet."

10:02.754 --> 10:05.855
It's my public, too, and I'm not
hiding behind anything.

10:05.857 --> 10:09.692
I go over a bridge,
through a tunnel,

10:09.694 --> 10:11.494
past Grand Central,
and it seems like

10:11.496 --> 10:14.630
they can spot me carrying
a pocket knife or a bad motive.

10:14.632 --> 10:18.033
What the hell is that?
Yet this sick bastard

10:18.035 --> 10:19.602
is able to slaughter old people

10:19.604 --> 10:21.437
seemingly at will,

10:21.439 --> 10:22.972
and your folks have
nothing on that?

10:22.974 --> 10:25.875
The earth you're scorching here
is your earth, too.

10:25.877 --> 10:27.777
You're damn right it is, Frank.

10:27.779 --> 10:29.545
And you're supposed
to keep it safe.

10:29.547 --> 10:30.880
The people don't feel safe.

10:30.882 --> 10:32.982
Call a curfew, buy some time.

10:32.984 --> 10:35.918
All the murders occurred
between 8:00 and midnight.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.853
And that'll work wonders
with calming the public down.

10:37.855 --> 10:39.855
Pattern killers,
if that's what this is,

10:39.857 --> 10:42.858
you either disrupt his pattern
or catch his mistakes.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.860
They don't just
run out of batteries.

10:44.862 --> 10:47.329
Frank, this is New York City.
I'm not calling a curfew.

10:47.331 --> 10:50.132
Catch his damn mistake!

10:50.134 --> 10:51.433
And catch him!

10:51.435 --> 10:54.370
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

10:54.372 --> 10:56.839
I didn't say it was easy, Frank.
I said do it.

10:59.110 --> 11:01.777
In the six years
we've worked together...

11:01.779 --> 11:04.180
Frank, years that you have
worked for me.

11:07.652 --> 11:10.586
I have never seen you
once try and play dumb.

11:10.588 --> 11:13.055
And you're not very good at it.

11:13.057 --> 11:15.991
So what the hell's
going on with you?

11:15.993 --> 11:19.195
Commissioner...

11:19.197 --> 11:21.497
get back to work.

11:59.237 --> 12:01.604
Green light. Let's move.

12:11.949 --> 12:13.515
Go, go.

12:18.589 --> 12:20.122
Baez, go.

12:24.428 --> 12:26.629
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

12:31.269 --> 12:33.602
Come on.

12:33.604 --> 12:35.638
Go.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.806
You go left. Go.

12:39.644 --> 12:41.810
Deploy flashbangs.

12:43.714 --> 12:45.915
<i>Granada! Granada!</i>

12:45.917 --> 12:47.883
Go, go! Shut the door!

13:18.582 --> 13:21.583
Frank!

13:21.585 --> 13:23.485
Frank, stay down! Stay down!

13:30.528 --> 13:32.127
Molina!

13:37.735 --> 13:39.501
You owe me one.

13:40.938 --> 13:42.771
Come on!

14:10.368 --> 14:11.934
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

14:11.936 --> 14:12.936
Yeah.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.745
Got to be 100 pounds
of heroin here.

14:22.747 --> 14:24.646
Good work, Detectives.

14:24.648 --> 14:25.914
You, too.

14:25.916 --> 14:27.883
Go team.

14:38.421 --> 14:40.354
Excuse us. Come on.

14:40.356 --> 14:42.390
Looks like you're a
real hero around here.

14:42.392 --> 14:45.126
You're
only as good as your last bust.

14:45.128 --> 14:47.228
Speaking of which,
we never recovered the cash

14:47.230 --> 14:49.497
from the heroin we seized.
Maybe it never changed hands.

14:49.499 --> 14:51.232
That's not what we heard.

14:51.234 --> 14:53.601
Word is, Pena received
the cartel's cash

14:53.603 --> 14:56.304
<i>before the delivery
of the product.</i>

14:56.306 --> 14:58.606
Now he's planning on
smuggling it back to Mexico.

14:58.608 --> 15:02.109
If we move fast, we can
take down Pena and the cash.

15:03.313 --> 15:04.412
What? What's the problem?

15:04.414 --> 15:05.980
We can't move on Pena.

15:05.982 --> 15:07.982
Wait a minute. Why the hell not?

15:07.984 --> 15:09.450
We flipped him.

15:09.452 --> 15:11.519
Wh... Pena's agreed

15:11.521 --> 15:15.056
to become an informant in future
cases against Mano Sangriento.

15:15.058 --> 15:17.124
Look, the seizures
are great for headlines,

15:17.126 --> 15:18.459
if that's what you want, okay?

15:18.461 --> 15:20.461
But if you really want
to hurt these guys,

15:20.463 --> 15:23.064
there's only one way to do it,
and that's by taking their cash.

15:23.066 --> 15:24.665
We took down the case.

15:25.735 --> 15:27.768
The operation's over.

15:27.770 --> 15:29.704
I'm sorry.

15:37.113 --> 15:39.213
Any luck finding out
who did this?

15:39.215 --> 15:40.247
Not yet.

15:40.249 --> 15:41.882
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

15:44.187 --> 15:45.519
Detective,

15:45.521 --> 15:46.787
get anything off that guy?

15:46.789 --> 15:48.255
No, says he didn't see the perp.

15:48.257 --> 15:49.824
I know. There's something
off about him.

15:49.826 --> 15:52.360
- Off how?
- Scene of the crime, it was almost like

15:52.362 --> 15:54.228
he was reading from
a script or something.

15:54.230 --> 15:56.564
His demeanor was all wrong.
His demeanor?

15:56.566 --> 15:57.965
Not just that.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.701
He also shops at the same food
co-op as the other six victims.

16:00.703 --> 16:02.670
As does half the population
of this precinct.

16:02.672 --> 16:04.939
And he said that he came down
as soon as he heard the attack,

16:04.941 --> 16:06.974
but the M.E. said that the vics
were dead for 20 minutes

16:06.976 --> 16:07.942
before I got to them.

16:07.944 --> 16:10.077
They said "up to
20 minutes," Reagan.

16:10.079 --> 16:11.479
So he still could've gone up,
changed his clothes

16:11.481 --> 16:12.813
and then reported the murders.

16:12.815 --> 16:15.249
Why the hell would this guy,
with a totally clean sheet,

16:15.251 --> 16:18.185
rush to find a cop if he just
crushed the skulls of two vics?

16:18.187 --> 16:19.787
I don't know. You don't know?

16:19.789 --> 16:21.889
That's the first thing that
you've said that I agree with.

16:21.891 --> 16:23.424
Hey, thanks.

16:23.426 --> 16:24.992
In there.

16:27.430 --> 16:28.562
Devon White.

16:28.564 --> 16:30.798
Lives in the same building
as the first Vic.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.967
Spent four years in Clinton
for assaulting and robbing

16:32.969 --> 16:34.268
an 83-year-old woman.

16:34.270 --> 16:35.770
He copped to the murders?

16:35.772 --> 16:37.204
Not yet, but he will.

16:37.206 --> 16:38.372
Glad to hear it.

16:38.374 --> 16:39.407
Hey, Reagan,

16:39.409 --> 16:42.676
I appreciate all your work
on the case.

16:54.323 --> 16:55.756
What are you doing here?

16:55.758 --> 16:57.992
In front of my house?

17:02.698 --> 17:03.467
What's that?

17:03.491 --> 17:05.839
The end of my career if anyone
finds out where you got it.

17:08.404 --> 17:11.539
Pena keeps his own personal boat
stashed in the West Side Marina.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.374
Uses it to ferry drugs and cash

17:13.376 --> 17:15.175
for Mano Sangriento.

17:15.178 --> 17:17.377
Why are you doing this?

17:17.380 --> 17:19.012
I worked Miami-Dade Narcotics
for seven years

17:19.015 --> 17:21.549
before I joined the DEA.

17:21.550 --> 17:24.185
Once a cop, always a cop.

17:36.132 --> 17:39.733
$65 million worth
of high-grade dope.

17:39.735 --> 17:41.168
That's a serious haul.

17:41.170 --> 17:43.471
Let's see if they can
make it stick in court.

17:45.141 --> 17:46.907
Speak of the devil.

17:46.909 --> 17:48.209
Hell of a nice bust, Danny.

17:48.211 --> 17:50.277
Yeah, too bad the feds
don't have the stones

17:50.279 --> 17:51.612
to finish the job.

17:51.614 --> 17:52.780
What are you talking about?

17:52.782 --> 17:56.450
Jose Pena did this deal
for some friends of his

17:56.452 --> 17:57.551
down in Mexico.

17:57.553 --> 17:58.786
He's sitting on their cash,

17:58.788 --> 18:00.321
but I'm not allowed
to go after him.

18:00.323 --> 18:01.288
Why not?

18:01.290 --> 18:02.823
Because the DEA flipped him.

18:02.825 --> 18:04.658
They must want to keep Pena

18:04.660 --> 18:06.494
in good standing
with the cartel.

18:06.496 --> 18:08.762
If he loses their money.
He loses his job.

18:08.764 --> 18:10.364
And his ability to keep the feds

18:10.366 --> 18:12.399
up on future shipments. Exactly.

18:12.401 --> 18:14.201
Okay, but if we grab
the cartel's cash,

18:14.203 --> 18:16.904
they're gonna think twice
about ever peddling their poison

18:16.906 --> 18:18.205
in New York City again.

18:18.207 --> 18:19.206
What do you want?

18:19.208 --> 18:21.542
I have it on good authority

18:21.544 --> 18:24.712
that Pena has a boat docked
on the West Side.

18:24.714 --> 18:27.915
I'm thinking he's gonna use that
boat to transport the drug money

18:27.917 --> 18:29.216
to the cartels.

18:29.218 --> 18:31.418
- You're looking to search the boat.
- Exactly.

18:31.420 --> 18:33.020
Forget it.

18:33.022 --> 18:34.088
"Forget it"?!

18:34.090 --> 18:35.589
You give the feds
every warrant they want!

18:35.591 --> 18:37.424
I ask you for one
and I can't get it?!

18:37.426 --> 18:39.293
Yeah, against
my better judgment.

18:39.295 --> 18:40.794
This is a federal matter, Danny.

18:40.796 --> 18:42.029
And even if it weren't,

18:42.031 --> 18:44.498
your gut doesn't constitute
probable cause.

18:46.235 --> 18:48.435
Thanks for nothing.

19:29.312 --> 19:31.078
Police! Stop!

19:33.816 --> 19:35.749
You got any other
weapons on you?

19:35.751 --> 19:37.985
No. I was just
trying to help her.

19:37.987 --> 19:39.086
I'm placing you under arrest.

19:39.088 --> 19:40.654
She needed me, Officer Reagan.

19:40.656 --> 19:42.623
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:42.625 --> 19:45.259
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

19:45.261 --> 19:47.528
I ended their pain.
Don't you understand?

19:49.632 --> 19:51.231
Come on, let's go.

19:56.706 --> 19:58.906
Then why did
you kill them, Evan?

19:58.908 --> 20:00.874
When I was eight,
my mother left,

20:00.876 --> 20:02.643
so I went to go live
with my grandmother.

20:02.645 --> 20:05.379
She was old and in pain.

20:05.381 --> 20:08.582
One morning,
Grammie was asleep in her chair,

20:08.584 --> 20:10.250
and she wouldn't wake up.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.285
The thing is, sh-she looked like

20:11.287 --> 20:12.920
she didn't have
a care in the world,

20:12.922 --> 20:14.021
like she didn't hurt anymore.

20:14.023 --> 20:17.358
Just like those people I helped.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.526
They don't hurt anymore.

20:20.630 --> 20:22.763
They don't have
a care in the world.

20:26.836 --> 20:29.570
He doesn't even realize
what he did was wrong.

20:29.572 --> 20:33.641
Chances are he won't be found
competent to stand trial.

20:35.678 --> 20:38.512
What'd you notice about him?
Notice how?

20:38.514 --> 20:41.515
Let's say he was at the booth
next to you in the diner,

20:41.517 --> 20:43.951
or with a camera
in the press pool,

20:43.953 --> 20:46.353
or just shaking your hand
at a grip and grin.

20:46.355 --> 20:48.322
I don't know, Frank.
I'm not a cop.

20:48.324 --> 20:50.457
Doesn't take a cop.

20:50.459 --> 20:51.759
Okay, what did I miss?

20:51.761 --> 20:52.793
That's just it.

20:52.795 --> 20:56.030
You didn't miss a thing.

20:56.032 --> 20:57.965
There's nothing to notice.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.867
What are you saying,
he was invisible?

20:59.869 --> 21:02.102
I'm saying, he was the guy
the neighbors always said,

21:02.104 --> 21:03.537
"What a nice young man,

21:03.539 --> 21:06.340
always so helpful,
with a hello for everybody."

21:06.342 --> 21:08.108
And you can't police
a monster like this.

21:08.110 --> 21:09.510
Is that your upshot here?

21:09.512 --> 21:14.448
Policing a case like this is by
nature and definition reactive.

21:14.450 --> 21:16.283
Well, no one could've
seen this coming, Frank?

21:16.285 --> 21:17.851
A coworker? A boss?

21:17.853 --> 21:20.988
A cop?

21:20.990 --> 21:22.723
I didn't say that.

21:22.725 --> 21:25.159
You didn't have to. You have
never pointed more fingers

21:25.161 --> 21:29.663
or shown less respect for my
people than in these last weeks.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.198
Frank, this animal

21:31.200 --> 21:33.801
has been roaming our streets
these last few weeks.

21:33.803 --> 21:35.903
Who do you expect me
to point the finger at?

21:35.905 --> 21:37.971
You get paid
to keep this city safe.

21:39.842 --> 21:41.842
That's right.

21:41.844 --> 21:43.510
That is my job.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.112
It's your only job.

21:47.817 --> 21:50.451
We got our guy.
I wanted to tell you personally.

21:50.453 --> 21:52.653
I won't take up
any more of your time.

22:10.406 --> 22:11.605
Nice boat.

22:11.607 --> 22:12.740
Get off the ladder.

22:12.742 --> 22:13.807
Do I know you?

22:13.809 --> 22:16.276
No, but we know you, Pena.

22:16.278 --> 22:18.979
Detective Reagan. This is
my partner, Detective Baez.

22:18.981 --> 22:20.414
Step aside with your
buddy over there.

22:20.416 --> 22:22.149
Keep your hands where
we can see them.

22:22.151 --> 22:23.650
Looks like you're
about to take a trip.

22:23.652 --> 22:25.719
Heading down to Florida.
Little vacation.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.154
Must get really exhausting,

22:27.156 --> 22:29.423
getting all those kids
strung out on smack.

22:29.425 --> 22:31.325
Something I can
help you with, Detective?

22:31.327 --> 22:32.459
Yeah, we'd like to take
a look around the boat.

22:32.461 --> 22:33.794
Do you have a search warrant?

22:33.796 --> 22:37.064
No. But we did speak
with the Coast Guard,

22:37.066 --> 22:39.767
who let us know that you never
submitted a cargo and crew list

22:39.769 --> 22:41.802
on your way up from Florida...

22:41.804 --> 22:43.504
An oversight that now allows us

22:43.506 --> 22:45.773
to come on the boat,
whether you like it or not.

22:45.775 --> 22:48.542
You are aware of my arrangement
with your government, right?

22:48.544 --> 22:50.244
We don't work with
the feds anymore.

22:50.246 --> 22:52.713
And you have no
arrangement with the NYPD.

22:52.715 --> 22:53.981
So we're coming on the boat.

22:53.983 --> 22:56.617
Step aside. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

22:56.619 --> 22:57.785
You're making a mistake.

22:57.787 --> 22:59.086
It's not the first time.

23:00.256 --> 23:01.555
Anybody else on the boat?

23:01.557 --> 23:02.723
Look for yourself.

23:02.725 --> 23:04.224
You behave,
so my partner doesn't

23:04.226 --> 23:07.227
have to put a slug in you.

23:25.147 --> 23:26.680
Bingo!

23:26.682 --> 23:28.949
We got it, partner!

23:28.951 --> 23:30.784
We got the cash. Move in.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.553
Go, go, go, go.

23:32.555 --> 23:34.254
Come on.

23:34.256 --> 23:36.089
It's on the cargo hold
on the floor.

23:36.091 --> 23:37.591
Go ahead.

23:37.593 --> 23:38.692
It's an illegal search.

23:38.694 --> 23:40.194
You can't charge me
with nothing.

23:40.196 --> 23:41.562
I'm not charging you
with anything.

23:41.564 --> 23:43.030
That's why
I'm not arresting you.

23:44.233 --> 23:48.602
But as for that cash inside,
you can kiss that good-bye.

23:48.604 --> 23:51.338
And we both know who
your buddies down in Mexico

23:51.340 --> 23:53.207
are gonna blame for that.

23:55.077 --> 23:57.277
Adiรณs, amigo.

24:09.566 --> 24:10.751
What's going on?

24:10.752 --> 24:11.951
You tell me.

24:12.854 --> 24:14.120
Apparently,
our friends at the DEA

24:14.122 --> 24:15.655
aren't happy with you

24:15.657 --> 24:17.890
taking down the cartel's cash.

24:18.860 --> 24:20.693
Jose Pena has a deal in place

24:20.695 --> 24:22.161
with the U.S. attorney's office.

24:22.163 --> 24:23.329
You knew that.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.364
Yeah, well, it's not like
I arrested him.

24:25.366 --> 24:27.500
You destroyed
Pena's relationship

24:27.502 --> 24:28.734
with Mano Sangriento,

24:28.736 --> 24:30.203
and put a price on his head.

24:30.205 --> 24:32.939
Detective Reagan got information
on the whereabouts of the cash

24:32.941 --> 24:35.575
independent of
your investigation.

24:35.577 --> 24:37.944
Highly credible information.

24:37.946 --> 24:40.880
The DEA has a national strategy
to deal with this cartel.

24:40.882 --> 24:43.983
NYPD bends over backwards
to help you guys.

24:43.985 --> 24:47.787
But our first obligation
is to protect this city.

24:47.789 --> 24:49.122
Now, Detective Reagan's actions

24:49.124 --> 24:50.456
will be reviewed.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.425
If he screwed up,
he'll be disciplined.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.933
Thanks for having my back, boss.

25:00.935 --> 25:02.301
Is that what you think
I was doing?

25:02.303 --> 25:03.050
Come on, listen. I just...

25:03.051 --> 25:04.083
No, you listen!

25:04.085 --> 25:06.219
I was doing it
for the department.

25:06.221 --> 25:07.587
What the hell
was I supposed to do,

25:07.589 --> 25:10.290
let Pena drop off the cash
to those animals?

25:10.292 --> 25:12.158
You want to know who's
on your old man's call sheet?

25:12.160 --> 25:14.561
The friggin' attorney general

25:14.563 --> 25:16.930
of the United States.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.731
That's not good, Danny.

25:18.733 --> 25:22.044
Look, the feds are trading
in the safety of the city

25:22.144 --> 25:23.610
for some big score

25:23.612 --> 25:25.612
that they may not even
be able to pull off.

25:25.614 --> 25:28.448
Even so, chain of command
exists for a reason.

25:28.450 --> 25:29.816
But you never got that

25:29.818 --> 25:32.519
when I was your C.O.,
and you still don't.

25:34.256 --> 25:37.190
I did what I thought was right.

25:37.192 --> 25:39.259
Yeah, consequences
be damned, like always.

25:39.261 --> 25:40.493
But know this.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.962
You come out on the wrong side
of this investigation,

25:42.964 --> 25:44.531
there'll be hell to pay.

25:45.967 --> 25:48.835
And, Reagan...

25:48.837 --> 25:51.838
that's what I have to say
as your boss.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.706
But cop to cop?

25:54.809 --> 25:56.176
Good work.

25:58.046 --> 25:59.646
Thanks.

26:03.185 --> 26:04.851
Hey.

26:06.655 --> 26:07.921
I owe you one.

26:07.923 --> 26:09.088
Nah, we're even.

26:09.090 --> 26:10.857
You just stood there and ate it.

26:10.859 --> 26:14.027
We're kind of
in the same boat here.

26:15.830 --> 26:17.330
Good working with you, Reagan.

26:17.332 --> 26:18.932
You, too.

26:18.934 --> 26:22.402
You ever want to try being
a real cop again, let me know.

26:26.074 --> 26:27.707
You wanted to see me?

26:27.709 --> 26:30.743
I understand your brother Danny
seized $18 million

26:30.745 --> 26:32.512
in cash from a vessel

26:32.514 --> 26:33.546
owned by Jose Pena.

26:33.548 --> 26:34.847
Yeah.

26:34.849 --> 26:36.316
He conducted the search
without a warrant.

26:36.318 --> 26:40.019
And you want to know
if he asked me to apply for one.

26:40.021 --> 26:42.555
He did. I turned him down.

26:42.557 --> 26:45.758
You potentially hindered one of
the largest drug cash seizures

26:45.760 --> 26:47.694
in the history of this country.

26:47.696 --> 26:49.295
So the ends justify the means?

26:49.297 --> 26:51.364
I must've missed that class
in law school.

26:56.638 --> 26:59.539
This ain't law school.

26:59.541 --> 27:01.007
We don't operate

27:01.009 --> 27:04.110
in a white bread world where
everything is fair and the law

27:04.112 --> 27:05.111
will set you free.

27:05.113 --> 27:06.446
The law is still the law.

27:06.448 --> 27:07.847
It should apply
to everyone equally.

27:07.849 --> 27:10.717
We deal with the deadliest
felons on the planet.

27:10.719 --> 27:13.586
Wins and losses are measured
by lives saved or lost.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.588
I know that. Then act like it.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.757
If you're bucking for a halo,
you're in the wrong business.

27:17.759 --> 27:20.159
I don't need a halo,
just my self-respect.

27:23.732 --> 27:26.199
You should remember
who you're talking to.

27:26.201 --> 27:29.569
I became a prosecutor
to deliver justice,

27:29.571 --> 27:31.404
and I'm damn good at it.

27:31.406 --> 27:33.606
But if you don't like
the way I do it,

27:33.608 --> 27:35.942
you want to take me on,
you go for it.

27:35.944 --> 27:39.445
But don't let the halo fool you,
'cause I like a good fight.

27:49.391 --> 27:51.491
What are you talking about?

27:51.493 --> 27:55.261
This was billed
as a dual announcement.

27:55.263 --> 27:57.664
If he doesn't...

27:57.666 --> 28:00.767
Yeah, I got it.

28:07.108 --> 28:08.775
What's the hold up?

28:12.414 --> 28:13.680
Mayor's not here.

28:13.682 --> 28:14.681
No.

28:14.683 --> 28:16.482
There isn't one.

28:16.484 --> 28:17.784
They said the mayor wants you

28:17.786 --> 28:19.118
to handle the announcement solo.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.253
Poole never missed

28:20.255 --> 28:21.521
a victory lap in his life.

28:21.523 --> 28:22.522
Until now.

28:22.524 --> 28:24.023
It's about me taking the weight

28:24.025 --> 28:25.491
for six dead bodies.

28:25.493 --> 28:26.793
But we caught the guy.

28:26.795 --> 28:28.328
Yeah, but it comes
soaked in blood,

28:28.330 --> 28:30.763
and the mayor wants
to keep his shoes clean.

28:30.765 --> 28:32.932
Let's go.

28:37.539 --> 28:39.639
<i>Baez, listen to me.</i>

28:39.641 --> 28:43.109
We just grabbed up 18 million
in drug cash, okay?

28:43.111 --> 28:45.511
We may not get medals for it,
but trust me,

28:45.513 --> 28:47.080
we're not gonna
get jammed up, either.

28:47.082 --> 28:48.481
Thanks, Danny.

28:48.483 --> 28:49.582
See you tomorrow.

28:49.584 --> 28:50.783
Good. Good night.

28:50.785 --> 28:53.119
We've got a 10-59R,

28:53.121 --> 28:55.154
fire in a domestic dwelling.

28:55.156 --> 28:56.222
NYFD en route.

28:56.224 --> 28:59.225
1712 Amboy Road.

28:59.227 --> 29:00.760
Son of a bitch.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.840
Hey!

29:13.842 --> 29:15.375
Hey! Hey.

29:15.377 --> 29:16.309
Whoa! No, that's my house!

29:16.311 --> 29:18.177
Get back! Where's my family?!

29:18.179 --> 29:19.112
It's not safe, sir.

29:19.114 --> 29:20.279
Was anyone inside? Get back.

29:20.281 --> 29:21.748
Was anyone inside?!
I don't know, sir!

29:21.750 --> 29:23.349
Danny!

29:23.351 --> 29:24.550
Danny!

29:24.552 --> 29:25.651
Linda!

29:25.653 --> 29:27.787
Danny! Dad!

29:27.789 --> 29:29.055
- Danny!
- Dad!

29:31.226 --> 29:33.326
I thought you were inside.
We're okay. We're okay.

29:33.328 --> 29:34.327
I thought you were inside.

29:34.329 --> 29:36.429
No, we went for pizza.
We came home.

29:36.431 --> 29:37.630
We...

29:37.632 --> 29:40.566
Okay, okay.

29:48.076 --> 29:49.709
We're okay.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.374
Yeah.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.576
Thanks for the update, Ed.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.514
Update?

30:17.516 --> 30:19.516
They located the device

30:19.518 --> 30:21.985
that started the fire.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.755
Let me guess,
same M.O. as the cartel's.

30:24.757 --> 30:26.957
It was payback, pure and simple.

30:26.959 --> 30:30.127
I'm gonna jump out of my skin
if I stay here. I'm going in.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.294
No, you're not.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.131
That's an order.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.365
"That's an order"?

30:35.367 --> 30:37.067
They bombed my house.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.569
Calls have been made.
Things are in motion.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.739
Those responsible
will pay for what they did.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.941
And you know better
than to ask particulars.

30:44.943 --> 30:46.977
I can't even ask... Anything.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.913
It's being taken care of.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.681
That's all you need to know.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.852
And all you need to know
is that I cannot just stand by.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.523
You got a job to do here.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.958
Go take care of your family.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.920
You shouldn't be here.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.691
You used me as
a human shield today.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.194
Wasn't my intention, Frank.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.795
Your absence at the
press conference

31:38.797 --> 31:39.863
played loud and clear:

31:39.865 --> 31:43.100
A vote of no confidence
in the NYPD.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.134
Sorry you feel that way.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.136
Exactly as you meant it to.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.976
I heard about the fire bombing.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.344
I'm so sorry.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.046
Hell of a thing.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.848
But everyone's okay,
is that right?

31:57.850 --> 31:59.449
Yes, all safe.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.184
Good. And at your home?

32:01.186 --> 32:02.252
Yes.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.253
Shouldn't you be there?

32:03.255 --> 32:05.322
I was there.
I'm going back there.

32:05.324 --> 32:08.191
Right after you kick my ass
around the room.

32:12.064 --> 32:16.299
Mr. Mayor, I think you have
lost confidence in my command,

32:16.301 --> 32:18.702
and I am prepared to step down.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.642
Frank, this morning,
I paid a condolence call

32:25.644 --> 32:28.979
to the family
of Fleming's last victims.

32:28.981 --> 32:31.314
Visits like that are
the worst part of my job.

32:31.316 --> 32:32.716
Yours, too.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.818
I've done more than I can count.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.020
You probably ten times
more than that.

32:37.022 --> 32:39.623
I find no use in looking
at that scoreboard.

32:39.625 --> 32:43.760
But we should offer some
measure of comfort, Frank.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.896
And of hope.

32:45.898 --> 32:48.765
That's all you can do.

32:48.767 --> 32:52.669
But I didn't have it, Frank.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.405
I just couldn't find the words.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.441
Sometimes there aren't any.

32:58.443 --> 33:01.011
We should offer some hope.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.847
Hell, I won two terms
on that message.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.350
But I didn't have it.

33:07.352 --> 33:10.720
It was a tough week.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.557
And this guy, this, um...

33:13.559 --> 33:15.559
Evan Fleming.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.093
How many more of those

33:17.095 --> 33:19.829
are just walking around
out there, waiting?

33:23.569 --> 33:26.303
I don't know.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.405
You can't know.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.174
I know.

33:31.176 --> 33:34.277
Or now I know.

33:34.279 --> 33:38.348
Change the subject
or you'll lose your mind.

33:38.350 --> 33:42.319
You know, I gave 28 years...

33:42.321 --> 33:45.355
the use of both my legs
to this city.

33:45.357 --> 33:49.159
Loved nearly
every single minute of it.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.465
Come on, Carter.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.702
You got a bar in here?
Let's have a drink.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.305
Monday morning,
I'm submitting my resignation

34:02.307 --> 34:03.406
to the city council.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.875
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

34:09.147 --> 34:10.647
All I ask is that

34:10.649 --> 34:12.482
you respect my decision.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.456
Please.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.498
You need to go home.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.933
To your family.

34:29.935 --> 34:34.137
Give them all that
rock-solid bluster.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.773
I'm very good, Frank.

34:42.214 --> 34:45.081
Is there anything I can say?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.951
You can give me your word...

34:47.953 --> 34:51.688
that you'll be just as hard on
my successor as you were on me.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.626
You have my word.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.633
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.736
Thank you, Commissioner.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.121
Thanks.

35:30.095 --> 35:32.929
Were they ever this small?

35:34.399 --> 35:35.965
We're gonna get through this.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.803
I just worry about
the boys, you know?

35:53.685 --> 35:57.470
Bad things happen
to everyone, boys.

35:57.471 --> 35:59.738
We all get knocked down.

35:59.740 --> 36:04.142
What matters is you get up.

36:04.144 --> 36:06.211
You keep going.

36:10.317 --> 36:12.551
But we spent our lives there.

36:14.822 --> 36:17.789
I just can't believe it's gone.

36:36.744 --> 36:38.076
Dinner's ready.

36:39.213 --> 36:41.346
- Not feeling too hungry, Dad.
- Don't eat.

36:46.754 --> 36:48.420
Did you bomb your house?

36:51.091 --> 36:53.959
No.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.394
But I may as well have.

36:55.396 --> 36:57.629
They came after you
because you hurt them,

36:57.631 --> 36:59.865
and you hurt them
because it's your job.

37:01.668 --> 37:04.069
And they hurt me, too.

37:04.071 --> 37:05.437
And my family.

37:05.439 --> 37:07.672
You can't look at it that way.

37:07.674 --> 37:10.475
Maybe not...

37:10.477 --> 37:11.977
but I could've listened.

37:11.979 --> 37:15.180
If not to the feds,
to Erin, to you.

37:17.418 --> 37:19.718
You feel guilty, see a priest.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.020
Right now
your family's downstairs.

37:22.022 --> 37:24.022
Yeah.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.792
And I don't know
what the hell to say to them.

37:26.794 --> 37:29.428
It doesn't matter what you say.

37:29.430 --> 37:32.097
It matters that you're there.

37:43.744 --> 37:45.544
Smells good.

37:45.546 --> 37:46.812
Well, I can't take credit.

37:46.814 --> 37:47.813
Janie, my neighbor,

37:47.815 --> 37:49.014
she made the roast,

37:49.016 --> 37:51.716
and Mrs. Baldini
made the lasagna.

37:51.718 --> 37:53.652
I think that's everything.

37:53.654 --> 37:55.987
Good. I'm starved.
Let's get this show on the road.

37:55.989 --> 37:57.222
We have to wait for Dad.

37:57.224 --> 37:58.824
- I'll go up and get him.
- Just sit tight.

37:58.826 --> 38:01.426
He'll be down.

38:02.796 --> 38:04.696
Give him a minute.

38:04.698 --> 38:06.131
Please tell your neighbors
thanks for the food, Linda.

38:06.133 --> 38:07.399
I will.

38:07.401 --> 38:09.835
It's the only upside to
a tragedy on the block.

38:09.837 --> 38:10.702
What's that?

38:10.704 --> 38:12.571
Everyone makes their best dish.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.507
I have a confession to make.

38:15.509 --> 38:17.542
I think I've been doing
my job all wrong.

38:17.544 --> 38:18.577
How's that?

38:18.579 --> 38:20.946
Well, for all
the ace detectives I got,

38:20.948 --> 38:23.782
a beat cop took down
our serial killer.

38:23.784 --> 38:25.484
No, it was right place,
right time.

38:25.486 --> 38:27.352
Yeah, right.

38:28.021 --> 38:29.120
Good going, Uncle Jamie.

38:29.122 --> 38:30.522
Thanks.

38:32.893 --> 38:33.959
Hey.

38:33.961 --> 38:35.327
Here he is. Let's eat.

38:35.329 --> 38:37.362
Since you were late,
you say grace.

38:37.364 --> 38:39.831
I don't think so.

38:39.833 --> 38:40.799
Come on, Danny.

38:40.801 --> 38:43.101
No. Not feeling
too thankful right now.

38:43.103 --> 38:44.903
You ask me, you got a lot

38:44.905 --> 38:46.104
to be thankful for.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.606
With all due respect, Gramps,

38:47.608 --> 38:48.840
I didn't ask you.

38:48.842 --> 38:50.308
It's not helping
anything, Danny.

38:50.310 --> 38:53.178
Exactly. So, can we just
get on with it and eat?

38:53.180 --> 38:55.947
Not before we say the prayer.

39:01.522 --> 39:03.955
Come on, Danny.
Just say it, brother.

39:03.957 --> 39:05.257
We don't blame you, Danny.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.025
Well, you should.

39:07.027 --> 39:08.994
We love you.
This wasn't your fault.

39:08.996 --> 39:11.296
And say you made
a different call.

39:11.298 --> 39:13.865
Say you let that drug money
sail back to Mexico.

39:13.867 --> 39:14.966
Then what?

39:14.968 --> 39:16.368
The cartel
would still be bringing

39:16.370 --> 39:17.469
drugs to the city.

39:17.471 --> 39:19.104
And people would keep dying.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.372
Kids, mostly.

39:20.374 --> 39:22.140
Appreciate it, guys.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.576
But I didn't end anything,
I didn't change anything.

39:24.578 --> 39:25.744
You don't know that.

39:25.746 --> 39:28.747
You tried.
That's all you can do.

39:28.749 --> 39:30.682
It's just a house, Danny.

39:34.621 --> 39:35.921
It's our home.

39:35.923 --> 39:38.623
We made it a home.

39:38.625 --> 39:41.626
Without us, it's just a house.

39:41.628 --> 39:43.228
And we still got us.

39:43.230 --> 39:46.698
And when we have everyone
we love, we have everything.

39:46.700 --> 39:50.535
And for that,
we should be grateful.

39:53.140 --> 39:56.408
And no matter the hardship
or the loss...

39:58.178 --> 40:02.380
this family does not
stand down, ever.

40:27.608 --> 40:31.576
Bless us, Lord...

40:31.578 --> 40:34.145
and these thy gifts...

40:43.323 --> 40:45.824
Which we are about to receive...

40:45.826 --> 40:48.159
From thy bounty,

40:48.161 --> 40:50.962
through Christ, our Lord, amen.
