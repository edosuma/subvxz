20:12.144 --> 20:14.312

It was not my idea!

-[Margot] How many
people are there?

21:30.523 --> 21:32.957
Just two people.
Your partner and my guy.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.225
Max and my guy.

21:34.227 --> 21:35.960
Look, please, you don't
have to do this. Please don't.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.262
Please don't.
We're not killers, Margot.

Don't do this, please.
It's just two guys.

[sighs]

23:45.258 --> 23:46.457
[sighs]

23:51.831 --> 23:54.231
We should have
heard from him by now.

23:54.333 --> 23:57.301
-You message him?
-Just chill the [muted]
out, man.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.336
All right?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.505
Your energy is, like,
weirding me out.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.241
Just, eat something.

24:04.343 --> 24:07.845
Could you just try
to contact him, please?

get that wallet

24:14.653 --> 24:16.320

is for nothing, right?

24:16.322 --> 24:17.855

-Just chill.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.599
[line disconnects]

34:06.078 --> 34:07.811
Hey, everyone. I'm Eli Roth

34:07.913 --> 34:09.346
and you just watched
<i> The Red Room.</i>

34:09.381 --> 34:12.616
I'm here with
our director and writer,

34:12.618 --> 34:14.418
-Justin Harding. Welcome.
-Thank you.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.055
So, Justin, we worked together
on <i> The Haunted Museum</i>

34:18.156 --> 34:20.457
and I'm a big fan
of your directing.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.359
I thought you did some
awesome, scary episodes.

34:22.427 --> 34:24.428
Had you heard
the story of the red room?

34:24.530 --> 34:28.331
And what was it about
this particular story
that got you excited?

34:28.433 --> 34:30.934
I have heard of read rooms.

34:31.036 --> 34:33.603
They actually made
a film a few years ago
called <i> Making Monsters</i>

34:33.605 --> 34:35.138
which was about
a red room killer.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.807
So I always thought
it was fascinating that

34:36.909 --> 34:38.475
if you're in the business of,

34:38.477 --> 34:39.943
you know,
operating a red room,

34:40.045 --> 34:41.744
you are kind of a producer.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.648
You're dealing with lights,
cameras, lenses, editing or,
you know, live streaming.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.550
'Cause a red room
is essentially a live stream

34:46.618 --> 34:47.851
on the dark web
where you can...

34:47.953 --> 34:51.421
Viewers interact via Bitcoin
to influence what happens.

34:51.556 --> 34:52.823
And I just thought,
"Oh, man, that's interesting.

34:52.925 --> 34:55.258
That, you know, the people
that would be involved in that

34:55.360 --> 34:57.127
have to be producers."

35:07.439 --> 35:09.239
[Margot] It's over.

35:09.308 --> 35:12.042
Believable, right? [chuckles]

35:12.111 --> 35:15.579
You already kind of had
a fascination with this
particular subject.

35:15.581 --> 35:18.048
It's a very dark subject
and, um,

35:18.117 --> 35:19.516
the more research I did,
the more I realized

35:19.585 --> 35:21.651
it's a great subject
for a horror film.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.253
'Cause it is
a great urban legend.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.722
There are so many classic
urban legends that we've
loved for decades

35:25.857 --> 35:27.357
and then the internet
comes along

35:27.459 --> 35:29.025
and ruins
a lot of urban legends

35:29.027 --> 35:31.428
-'cause you can
just figure out--
-Yeah, snopes.com

35:31.497 --> 35:33.530
-just debunked what was real
and what wasn't.
-Yeah.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.398
The idea that
there could be this,

35:35.400 --> 35:37.734
sort of faceless audience
behind a computer screen

35:37.836 --> 35:40.537
dismantling you, destroying
you and your life, you know?

35:40.639 --> 35:42.939
It's a great metaphor for,
you know, what can happen

35:43.041 --> 35:44.808
when we have, uh,
access to the internet

35:44.943 --> 35:45.742
and can do what we want

35:45.844 --> 35:47.611
and can access
anything we desire.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.613
It shines a light
on the darkest,

35:49.615 --> 35:51.414
<i> you know,</i>
<i> aspects of human nature.</i>

35:56.822 --> 35:59.656
[Alex grunting]

36:05.030 --> 36:07.998
Yeah, I was always fascinated
by what people will do

36:08.000 --> 36:10.100
when they know they're
not gonna get caught.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.935
When they're certain
that no one's gonna see it

36:12.037 --> 36:13.937
and that they can
get away with it anonymously.

36:14.039 --> 36:17.140
People just go right
to some animal state.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.609
-No, no--
-[screams in pain]

36:23.415 --> 36:25.081
It's also interesting because

36:25.083 --> 36:26.416
there's an obvious road
to go down

36:26.518 --> 36:27.918
if you're gonna tell a story
about a red room

36:27.920 --> 36:29.753
which is to go into, you know,

36:29.821 --> 36:31.421
to really make
something super gory

36:31.523 --> 36:33.557
and go down that torture-porn
path which is great,

36:33.659 --> 36:36.226
but I also thought it'd be
really interesting to do
something different.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.628
You know? Um, just something
that subverts expectations.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.530
Yeah, well that's the trick
with the red room.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.299
Because there's
different ones.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.602
-There's one legend which is
just a pop-up ad...
-Yeah.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.204
...just saying "What is in
the red room? What is in--"

36:47.206 --> 36:49.105
And once you get the pop-up
add, it's like <i> The Ring.</i>

36:49.208 --> 36:50.807
Like, it takes over
your computer,

36:50.909 --> 36:52.542
then starts showing you
the victims,

36:52.611 --> 36:54.511
and then you become
one of the victims

36:54.513 --> 36:57.314
in the next pop-up add
that someone gets.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.916
Or there's the person
paying with Bitcoin

36:59.918 --> 37:01.851
-to torture another person.
-Yes.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.920
But then it feels like
stuff that we have

37:03.922 --> 37:06.823
seen before and that kind of
both of us have done.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.659
So, one of the things I loved
about it was your approach

37:09.728 --> 37:12.128
and the story
and throwing in the daughter

37:12.231 --> 37:16.032
and these people
that are sort of doing it
for entertainment

37:16.101 --> 37:18.101
and that it's fake
and then it turns real.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.503
How did you find a way
into this story that was

37:20.639 --> 37:22.706
new and fresh and excited you
as a director?

37:22.808 --> 37:25.542
You know, I researched, uh,
you know, for a long time

37:25.611 --> 37:26.643
and what I discovered was

37:26.745 --> 37:28.445
a lot of the red rooms
that had been encountered

37:28.513 --> 37:31.214
proved to be, um, scams.

37:31.216 --> 37:32.415
The people that were involved

37:32.417 --> 37:34.317
were just ripping off
the viewers for their Bitcoin.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.452
And you can
actually go online,

37:35.553 --> 37:37.186
you can see
because of the blockchain

37:37.255 --> 37:39.623
you can see how much Bitcoin
had been transferred into
these red room sites.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.725
And I just thought, "Wow,
what kind of characters

37:41.727 --> 37:44.227
would be involved in creating
a red room like that?

37:44.229 --> 37:45.862
And who would
these people be?"

37:45.997 --> 37:47.731
And I just though, like,
"That's a great, sort of,

37:47.866 --> 37:50.100
launching-off point
for something that's
character driven."

37:50.102 --> 37:51.735
Like, who are these people?
And then to develop

37:51.737 --> 37:55.038
a story about characters
who have an actual motivation
that we can relate to,

37:55.107 --> 37:58.708
to put us into their shoes
and to understand why this
red room exists for them,

37:58.710 --> 38:00.210
<i> was the inspiration</i>
<i> for the episode.</i>

38:02.447 --> 38:03.546
Here we go.

38:12.524 --> 38:16.559
What do you think, Hulky?
Should we cash some in?

38:21.500 --> 38:24.401
Yeah. Not just yet.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.338
In all your research
for red rooms,

38:28.440 --> 38:31.107
did you ever find any evidence
there are real ones?

38:31.242 --> 38:33.943
You do hear... Yeah,
but that's what makes it
a great urban legend.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.812
'Cause yes, you hear on,
you can read on,

38:35.914 --> 38:37.747
you know, Reddit forms people
who have encountered them.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.649
First-hand encounters.
It's on a Reddit form.

38:39.718 --> 38:40.917
That's, that's how
I found Hostel.

38:41.018 --> 38:46.222
There was a link to a page of
"Oh, you can pay $10,000

38:46.224 --> 38:48.024
and go into a room and put
a bullet in someone's head

38:48.026 --> 38:49.359
to know what that feels like."

38:49.428 --> 38:51.528
And the discussion was,
is that real?

38:51.530 --> 38:54.864
There have been cases,
like, actual, proven cases.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.265
But not the live stream.

38:56.267 --> 38:58.501
The live stream is where
it really becomes
an urban legend.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.303
One thing I love
about your directing

39:00.405 --> 39:03.006
is that it's very clean
and very specific.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.842
And you're really
meticulous with your shots.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.044
Do you shot list?
Do you plan it out?

39:08.113 --> 39:09.145
Show up and wing it?

39:09.214 --> 39:11.948
What's your approach
to doing a scary movie?

39:12.050 --> 39:15.018
I'm obsessed with the idea
of fixing it in prep.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.686
I don't like
fixing it in post.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.686
I do my own editing.

39:17.723 --> 39:18.822
I sometimes do my own
visual effects.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.023
I'm heavy in post-production.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.058
I don't like being in
post-production fixing stuff.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.360
I like to capture it
in camera.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.195
I'll come to set
hyper-prepared.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.031
I shot list, but I storyboard
every single shot, typically.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.100
Sometimes I'll previs
full sequences.

39:30.235 --> 39:31.567
I'll just,
I'll build animatics.

39:31.636 --> 39:34.604
First of all, I wish
every director was
as prepared as you.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.439
-Myself included.
-[laughs softly]

39:36.508 --> 39:38.942
Let's talk about
some of the kill stuff.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.610
How close to it was
what you had in your head?

39:40.612 --> 39:42.712
And how gory
did you want to go with it?

39:42.714 --> 39:43.847
-Or not.
-Um...

39:43.982 --> 39:46.249
I wanted to deliver on
the promise of this red room

39:46.351 --> 39:47.717
and on the promise
of the genre.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.319
So, I definitely wanted
to go with gore,

39:49.321 --> 39:50.820
but to do it in a way
that's just a little bit,

39:50.922 --> 39:52.956
you know, in a way
that's producible and

39:53.058 --> 39:55.325
with that in a way that
we can do on budget
and on schedule

39:55.460 --> 39:57.460
that's also, you know,
cinematic and creative.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.561
[man] No, no, don't!

39:59.865 --> 40:02.132
Oh, God. No, no, no!

40:05.404 --> 40:07.303
[screaming in pain]

40:10.041 --> 40:11.508
I think the final kill

40:11.610 --> 40:13.843
is a good example of,
of how I like to do it.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.513
Because all the actual
stabbing and killing

40:16.515 --> 40:18.047
that happens is off-camera.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.116
That final kill,
there's a shot where we

40:20.218 --> 40:22.819
come across the tools,
all the tools on the table.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.522
And you can just see her
grabbing them and you hear
her stabbing them.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.724
And you know it's,
whatever's happening,
you know it's awful

40:27.726 --> 40:30.059
and your imagination's
building up and then
there's a reveal

40:30.161 --> 40:32.128
and you can see him at the end
with all the items in him.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.830
I call it
the human pincushion.

40:33.832 --> 40:37.700
The trick is, people go,
"Oh, <i> Alien</i>  and <i> Jaws</i>
don't show the monster."

40:37.702 --> 40:39.936
And then people are like,
"They didn't show anything."

40:40.038 --> 40:42.038
And then if you show too much,
it becomes silly.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.807
-Balance.
-So it's really
finding this balance of

40:43.909 --> 40:46.709
when you know the audience
really wants it,

40:46.711 --> 40:48.044
not giving it to them,

40:48.146 --> 40:50.346
but then giving it to them
in a way they didn't expect.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.948
Yeah. You know,
it's more about the suspense

40:52.050 --> 40:53.716
than the gore to some degree.

40:53.718 --> 40:56.352
<i> Oh, I love the idea of just</i>
<i> sustaining it.</i>

40:56.454 --> 40:58.154
<i> -Sustaining it, sustaining i</i>
<i> And then the reveal.</i>
-[Roth] <i> Yeah.</i>

40:58.223 --> 41:01.124
-[Max screaming]
-[stabbing]

41:05.764 --> 41:06.830
[slice]

41:13.939 --> 41:15.605
[Max breathing heavily]

41:19.611 --> 41:22.212
Yeah, we found in <i> Hostel,</i>
the moment of the guy

41:22.214 --> 41:24.147
trying to figure out
which tool to pick

41:24.215 --> 41:28.351
was way scarier than any
of the actual cutting itself.

41:28.419 --> 41:31.221
So, I was like, "Oh, man,
I wish I had shot more of

41:31.323 --> 41:34.624
-the guy like 'This one? No.
What about this? Mmm.'"
-[Harding] Yeah.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.693
Like, that's where
the audience is squirming.

41:36.828 --> 41:37.961
[Harding] 'Cause it's
building suspense

41:38.096 --> 41:40.129
and you're just
waiting for the, for the bang.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.331
Thank you, Justin.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.233
Where can anyone go to
find more of your work?

41:43.301 --> 41:45.702
Or more, or to follow you?
Or to look at your stuff?

41:45.837 --> 41:47.904
You can go to
justinhardingfilmmaker.com.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.405
I've got all
my short films on there.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.007
Um, I have a feature film
called <i> Making Monsters</i>

41:51.009 --> 41:53.610
that you can rent
on all platforms.

41:53.712 --> 41:54.777
Well, I'm sure a lot
of people will be

41:54.846 --> 41:56.446
checking out your work,
just from these episodes.

41:56.515 --> 41:58.515
Thank you so much
for doing it. It's a pleasure.

41:58.517 --> 41:59.716
-Thank you.
-Awesome.
