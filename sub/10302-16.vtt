02:06.320 --> 02:09.392
Look at her swinging back and forth.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.468
The way the sunlight hits her skin.

02:14.280 --> 02:17.113
I'd sure like to have
that in my mouth.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.840
Al, you are talking about
a stupid apple...

02:21.040 --> 02:23.156
...swinging from a tree.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.956
You're missing the point,
my little lust-buster.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.120
I didn't even know
that was an apple tree.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.079
Wonder why it suddenly
decided to bloom.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.156
I've gotta quit eating
out of that dumpster...

02:38.360 --> 02:40.351
...behind the Mexican restaurant.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.430
Honey, why don't you
just go buy an apple?

02:44.680 --> 02:47.148
Or at least pick that one. It's ripe.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.753
No, it isn't, Peg.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.356
It says so right here
in Farmer lggy's Almanac.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.995
"Sow in summer, reap in fall.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.312
Bury your wife
when the wheat gets tall."

03:02.080 --> 03:05.868
Oh, excuse me.
That's his chapter on taters and loaf.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.233
Does it say anything in there like,
"Plant your barley, plant your rye.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.556
Sell a shoe before you die."

03:14.400 --> 03:16.630
No, Peg, it doesn't.
You must be confusing that...

03:16.840 --> 03:20.719
...with Farmer lggy's wife's book:
The U seless Crone's Almanac.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.394
Pumpkin, pumpkin,
I want you to do me a favour.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.393
Go to the hardware store
and get daddy some smudge pots.

03:27.760 --> 03:28.988
What are smudge pots?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.993
They keep your apples warm
so they don't get frozen.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.196
You call them Marines.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.550
Son, I have an even
more important job for you.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.718
Go get me 50 pounds of manure.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.673
Oh, and Bud,
I need a jumbo box of tampons.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.674
And don't forget my 'rhoid cream.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.592
Anybody need anything embarrassing
while I'm at it?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.270
- Suppositories.
- Suppositories.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.396
I was just coming over to see you.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.272
Not right now.
I gotta go somewhere.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.159
- Oh, well, can I go with you?
- No.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.710
And don't follow me either.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.592
Well, Peg, I guess I'll go outside
and be alone with my apple.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.037
I'll just be here with my Oprah.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.034
I wish my apple would grow
as fast as your Oprah.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.676
My husband pays
too much attention to me.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.872
He's always wanting sex.
What should I do?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.116
Send him over here.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.629
Peg!

04:44.840 --> 04:46.398
My apple's gone.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.158
This neighbourhood's going to hell.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.191
First the double homicide
and now this.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.996
I think there might be a connection.
There's a serial harvester at work.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.754
- Oh, Al, tell me you're not calling...
- Police.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.436
- Well, at least don't tell them you're...
- AI Bundy here.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.876
I'd like to report a missing apple.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.430
No, not some stupid computer,
I'm talking about a fruit.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.197
I know it's not a doughnut,
but it's important to me.

05:12.760 --> 05:16.230
He's transferring me
to the chief of stolen produce.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.952
Hey, guys.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.711
Hello, who is this?

05:25.040 --> 05:27.156
Lieutenant Granny Smith.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.878
Wait a second. You sound like
that Officer Jalopy I talked to...

05:31.080 --> 05:33.071
...when I called to report
the Dodge missing.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.158
Okay, that's it. I'm calling the mayor.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.712
Who is the mayor?

05:40.360 --> 05:42.510
McCheese.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.990
Okay, you're in trouble now, buddy.
I voted for him.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.356
And they say
you can't fight city hall.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.513
- Where'd you get that apple?
- Oh, it was in my yard.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.150
Oh, and it tastes
even better than it looks.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.994
I don't wanna spoil my appetite.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.353
Hey, that was my apple.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.795
- It was in my yard.
- But it was on my tree.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.712
The limb was hanging
over my property.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.150
Excuse me.
You don't have any property.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.238
Your wife has property,
some of which is you.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.917
This from a man who steals our paper,
takes our bottled water...

06:27.160 --> 06:29.833
...and eats out of our bird feeder?

06:31.040 --> 06:34.350
Well, I wouldn't do that if you
didn't put out those tasty pecans.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.793
Jefferson, I was writing out
a check to the workmen...

06:38.040 --> 06:42.272
...and I found there was only
one check left where 25 should be.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.270
- Did they all look like this?
- Yes.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.794
I'll look into it.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.679
Well, since you're both
in a check-writing mood...

06:50.920 --> 06:53.593
...l'd like to be reimbursed
for my apple.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.468
Pay no attention to him.

06:55.720 --> 06:59.190
The fence is on the property line and
the apple was on our side of the fence.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.590
You can't go exactly
by where the fence line is.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.189
That fence was thrown together
with boards and nails.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.432
Peg, you remember
the slipshod way you built it.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.398
Yes, but at least
the fence stayed up...

07:11.640 --> 07:14.518
...which is more than I can say
for the foreman.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.276
And to think I had a stake
and didn't drive it through your heart.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.596
Jefferson, I'm suing you
for damages.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.870
Al, I'm suing you for mental stress.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.553
- Talk about mental stress?
- Yeah.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.236
How about the night your shade was up
and I watched your wife undress?

07:38.520 --> 07:42.911
Well, how about us having
to see your son soap himself?

07:44.240 --> 07:47.630
Look, Jefferson, Bullwinkle.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.313
This is getting you nowhere.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.120
The way to settle
a property-line dispute is simple.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.510
- Get a survey done.
- That's a good idea.

07:54.760 --> 07:58.150
You ask 50 people, I'll ask 50 people,
and we'll just see who...

07:58.400 --> 08:01.870
Not that kind of survey,
you double-dip.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.795
- A property-line survey.
- Yeah.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.031
Yeah, then we'll find out
once and for all...

08:08.240 --> 08:09.753
...who's who and what's what.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.355
Good idea. But I warn you...

08:12.600 --> 08:14.636
...when this is all
said and done, you, sir...

08:14.840 --> 08:17.354
...will owe me an apple
and an apology.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.750
And so will your husband.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.069
You know, Al, that surveyor
really looks familiar.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.914
Now, as I said...

08:32.039 --> 08:35.919
...when parcel A and parcel B
were divided up originally...

08:36.159 --> 08:38.150
...the records were destroyed by fire.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.991
But we do know that...

08:40.240 --> 08:43.073
The little Partridge boy.

08:48.240 --> 08:53.109
Al, doesn't he look
exactly like Danny Partridge?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.997
Peg, please,
there's an apple at stake here.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.637
- He does.
- Well, I'm not.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.316
Now as I was saying, the Bundy land
was originally Indian land.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.438
Actually, it was Indian landfill.

09:07.840 --> 09:12.118
It's where they threw
their rotting moccasins.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.397
Now, it's because of that
that the real property line...

09:15.640 --> 09:19.349
...becomes very irregular and stinky.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.438
So who does the apple tree
really belong to?

09:22.680 --> 09:24.159
Does it really matter?

09:24.400 --> 09:26.868
The important thing
is that we're neighbours...

09:27.080 --> 09:28.308
...and we must get along.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.632
Well, in answer to your question,
the tree belongs...

09:31.840 --> 09:34.593
...to the D'Arcys.
- Yes!

09:40.400 --> 09:43.472
- Hey, are you sure that you aren't...?
- Yes, I'm sure.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.632
I've never been so sure
of anything in my entire life.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.311
Let's go.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.673
Let's go, Danny. We gotta be
in Pittsburgh by midnight.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.592
Come on, get happy.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.272
I think since our fence line
has never been challenged before...

10:21.480 --> 10:24.597
...the next apple that grows
on that tree should be mine.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.196
Sorry, Al, you heard
what the man said.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.709
You mean to tell me you're gonna
believe what a crazy surveyor...

10:34.960 --> 10:37.315
...in a psychedelic bus says?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.912
Look, Al, we agreed to abide
by the results of the survey...

10:41.160 --> 10:43.276
...and the survey says
that the tree is ours.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.754
That's right.

10:44.960 --> 10:49.397
What's yourn is yourn
and what's our'n is our'n.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.758
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have a little apple-celebrating to do.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.275
Adam and Eve style.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.671
I wish there was something
that I could do.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.036
Oh, Al, just forget about the tree.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.795
And why don't we do something
Adam and Eve style?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.713
That's a good idea, Peg.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.270
You put a fig leaf over your face
and give me back my rib.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.914
Let me help you out with this, honey.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.678
Well, here's to our new tree.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.154
What should we call it?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.516
How about firewood?

11:37.800 --> 11:39.711
That's the beauty
of the law, Jefferson.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.639
It makes ownership specific
and unquestioned.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.030
I think that's what our ancestors
had in mind...

11:45.280 --> 11:48.352
...when they massacred the Indians
and wrote the Bill of Rights.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.919
Al.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.310
Al Bundy,
what do you think you're doing?

12:04.560 --> 12:06.790
Going blind if you stand up.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.229
Look, Al, this happens to be
a private party...

12:14.440 --> 12:16.829
...so we'd appreciate it
if you get out of our yard.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.473
But this isn't your yard.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.955
If you had read your map
a little more carefully...

12:21.160 --> 12:24.072
...you would have seen
that this property belongs to me.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.636
Welcome to Bundiana.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.548
He's right.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.274
Our barbecue is on their property.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.994
Al, I didn't realize how much
that apple tree meant to you.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.997
It would be wrong of us to keep it.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.510
So we'll give you your tree back
in exchange for our barbecue.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.993
Tell you what I'll do.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.118
I'll give you a part
of your barbecue back.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.828
Peggy Bundy.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.396
I would expect this kind of aboriginal
behaviour from the mud people...

13:28.640 --> 13:31.473
...but I'm surprised you're out here
supporting this outrage.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.312
I'm really sorry.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.593
But it's not often Al offers
to take us on a family picnic.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.154
No need to apologise,
is there, Marcie?

13:41.400 --> 13:44.073
After all, what's our'n is our'n...

13:44.280 --> 13:47.272
...and what's yourn is yourn.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.792
Excuse me, Mom.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.631
- Excuse me, but these are ours.
- Not anymore.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.189
Some never were.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.799
Don't worry, dear,
I'll take care of this.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.188
Then when I opened
the bedroom door...

14:32.400 --> 14:37.838
...I saw him making love
not only to a woman but a...

14:38.200 --> 14:40.589
What happened? What happened?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.553
Sorry, Peggy...

14:42.800 --> 14:46.588
...but your cable line seems
to have passed through our property.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.798
Al.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.112
They killed Oprah.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.875
Now, look.
Look what you've done to my wife.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.156
Don't you realize
that without cable TV...

14:59.360 --> 15:01.555
...she'll wanna talk to me now.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.952
You should've thought of that
before you stole our barbecue.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.876
Two can play at this game.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.958
Get out of my way, gluteus minimus.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.156
Hey, hey, hey.
That's our phone line.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.436
It's on my property.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.152
Oh, good, our first customer.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.036
As you can see,
this driveway belongs to us...

15:52.280 --> 15:54.953
...but we'll be glad to let you use it,
won't we, Jefferson?

15:55.160 --> 15:57.549
Sure, as long as he pays the toll.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.076
- How much is it?
- Fifteen-hundred dollars.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.032
Exact change, please.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.669
Fifteen-hundred dollars?
Are you crazy?

16:08.200 --> 16:11.237
Who you calling crazy, punk?

16:15.840 --> 16:17.478
Your wife.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.956
I don't need the stinking driveway.
I'll drive out through my yard.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.637
I wish they'd hurry up
and fix our cable.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.235
Me too. I hate nature shows.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.553
How much longer do we have to watch
the mating habits of the sea anemone?

16:52.520 --> 16:56.798
Well, at least it's better
than watching them act out Martin.

16:57.960 --> 17:02.397
I just didn't buy it when Bud
kept saying, "I gots to have it."

17:03.640 --> 17:05.436
I'll get it.

17:16.599 --> 17:20.275
Hi. I'm the building code inspector.
Are you the one that called?

17:20.520 --> 17:21.953
I am.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.079
- Aren't you...?
- No.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.197
Don't even ask. I'm not him.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.069
I've never been him.
I can't even stand the little creep.

17:33.280 --> 17:37.717
Now, I understand you wanted
to report an illegal driveway.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.315
Yes, I did, inspector.
That one right out there.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.632
If you look carefully you can see
that it's built nowhere near code.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.674
I know because I built it myself
out of ground-up women's shoes.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.754
How much is the fine?

17:50.280 --> 17:53.636
Well, since you turned yourself in,
I think I'll let it go at $100.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.389
I see. What if I said I built it that way
just to make you look like an idiot?

17:58.520 --> 18:01.637
Then that would be $1500.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.948
And what if we called you
a moron to boot?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.552
Two thousand dollars.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.236
Are you sure you're not Gary Coleman
from Diff'rent Strok es?

18:13.320 --> 18:15.072
No. I am not.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.312
Good. I hated that show.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.838
Five thousand dollars.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.196
Don't give it to me.
It's not my driveway.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.396
See, it belongs
to those people next door...

18:32.600 --> 18:34.192
...but they might not let you in...

18:34.440 --> 18:37.716
...because the only black person
they respect is Ted Danson.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.075
What you talking about, Bundy?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.868
Oh, hell, now I have to fine myself.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.558
That was great, Al. You got him.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.873
Tune in next week
for another exciting episode of Cops.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.673
I hate playing the hairy drug dealer.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.112
Come in, Jefferson.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.955
Good one, Al. I gotta hand it to you...

19:21.160 --> 19:24.914
...you're a formidable adversary.
You've certainly won my respect.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.114
Does that mean I'll get the use
of my driveway back?

19:28.360 --> 19:30.715
Well, we've already taken
the toll booth down...

19:30.960 --> 19:33.679
...and I can promise
that you'll never have to worry...

19:33.880 --> 19:37.873
...about that little
driveway problem again.

19:39.320 --> 19:42.710
Three, two, one.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.356
I guess I should have brought
some extra earmuffs with me.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.113
What?

19:55.880 --> 19:57.757
So long.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.830
What'd he call me?

20:01.960 --> 20:04.872
Why would I want any cheese?

20:06.160 --> 20:10.676
I never realized what a turn-on
handling heavy explosives could be.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.189
Well, you came to the right place.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.035
My pyjamas are filled with dynamite.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.756
Jefferson, the earth
is moving for me.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.072
Hey, it's moving for me too.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.390
Damn, I'm good.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.715
You're not this good.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.558
Oh, my God. It's Al.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.155
He's jacking up the house.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.874
We're even now.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.151
Hello, Fred? Jefferson D'Arcy.

21:18.400 --> 21:22.916
Say, does your son
still have that rocket launcher?

21:41.360 --> 21:43.715
There's probably a lesson
to be learned from this...

21:43.920 --> 21:46.150
...but I'll be damned
if I know what it is.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.072
Hey, Al...

21:51.280 --> 21:53.032
...l've been doing a lot of thinking...

21:53.280 --> 21:56.511
...and I've decided to apologise.
- We both want to.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.718
Friendship is much more important
than material things.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.797
Oh, you're right, Marcie.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.554
I wanna be friends too. Al?

22:04.760 --> 22:07.593
We're married, Peg,
we can't be friends.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.238
I think she meant
with the D'Arcys, Dad.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.958
Well, I guess it's all right
to try to mend our friendship.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.919
Dad, they blew out
the wall of our house.

22:19.160 --> 22:23.676
Bud's room is a mess.
There's rubber body parts everywhere.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.476
I know, pumpkin.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.678
But all the more reason
we should extend the hand...

22:30.880 --> 22:32.677
...of forgiveness.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.673
Our other neighbours
will hear of this grand gesture...

22:35.880 --> 22:37.472
...and be pleased.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.871
Then other communities will come...

22:40.120 --> 22:42.554
...to see the D'Arcys
and the Bundys...

22:42.760 --> 22:44.910
...living side by side in peace.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.916
Then whole cities will take note.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.673
Then countries.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.036
And who knows, maybe someday...

22:53.240 --> 22:54.753
...in a universe far away...

22:58.800 --> 23:01.314
- It's on my side.
- It's on my side. It's mine!
