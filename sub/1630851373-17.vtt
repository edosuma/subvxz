a concussion,

a lot worse.

a fireable offense.

No, I guess she only
really knows the deceased.

12:45.373 --> 12:48.245
The driver's just
a friend of his.

12:48.289 --> 12:53.294

How'd you end up a paramedic
in the first place?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.926
Actually I started
by studying pre-med

15:26.969 --> 15:29.972
at Johns Hopkins for undergrad.
Class of 2018.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.061
Wow, that's--
that's not a usual path.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.976
I was thinking
emergency doctor at first,

15:34.020 --> 15:36.196
but ultimately decided
the adrenaline rush

15:36.239 --> 15:37.937
of ambulance work was
better than the inside

15:37.980 --> 15:41.027
of any hospital,
so I headed back to Chicago.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.205
You just gotta be ready.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.033
Like, for example, all right?

15:47.076 --> 15:50.427
Teacher says,
"Uh, your daughter glued

15:50.471 --> 15:53.256
another girl's head
to the table."

15:53.300 --> 15:55.998
So you get a shocked
look on your face

15:56.042 --> 15:58.435
and you say,
"What kind of school

15:58.479 --> 16:01.090
would use glue that strong
around children?"

16:01.134 --> 16:03.484
See? You flip it.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.094
- Glue?
- Yeah.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.270

with scissors too.

About two or three days
I guess.

Javi's been acting differently

17:06.851 --> 17:09.289
the past week or so.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.073
Much happier, to be honest,

17:11.117 --> 17:13.902

with the class.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.687

17:40.581 --> 17:42.104
Oh, wow.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.411

She insisted
that the receipt wasn't hers.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.126
- Did you call her on it?
- I was about to,

18:04.170 --> 18:07.042
but then I saw this bruise
on her neck.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.045
And Violet confirmed
that she probably had it

18:10.089 --> 18:12.700

- What does that mean?

That--

18:14.267 --> 18:16.617
this girl is being super cagey.

is part of the reason why.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.710
I mean, look, she was wearing
a high-necked top

is relevant?

from anything.

So your gunman here,
he kidnaps or carjacks

23:25.447 --> 23:27.144
the other two
and then he drives around,

23:27.188 --> 23:28.668

bank accounts

23:28.711 --> 23:30.626

out of the wreck,

23:34.151 --> 23:36.327

now, right?

23:36.371 --> 23:37.285
Mm-hmm.

Seems impossible even.

Violet...

36:56.910 --> 37:00.653
Why do I miss you so much
when I'm not with you?
