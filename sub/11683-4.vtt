<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.240 --> 00:05.741
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.843
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.911 --> 00:12.112
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.180 --> 00:14.515
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.582 --> 00:16.417
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.484 --> 00:19.219
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.287 --> 00:21.288
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.390 --> 00:23.791
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:23.858 --> 00:25.426
Should we shoot them?

00:25.493 --> 00:27.227
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.295 --> 00:29.997
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.065 --> 00:32.366
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.433 --> 00:34.301
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.369 --> 00:37.438
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.505 --> 00:39.073
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.742
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:41.810 --> 00:43.577
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:47.482 --> 00:50.651
Unless you're willing to see
your girlfriend go to prison

00:50.719 --> 00:55.322
for the rest of her life,
you will do exactly what I say.

00:56.725 --> 00:58.392
Wow. Anson warned me
you were good.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.027
I guess he was right.

01:00.095 --> 01:02.262
You were working with Anson
the whole time.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.464
You know how Anson is.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.065
Once he gets his claws in you,
that's it.

01:10.472 --> 01:11.672
I'm gonna get you out.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.944
Who sent you?

01:17.011 --> 01:20.013
I don't know! But they said
they wanted you dead!

01:20.081 --> 01:21.715
Whoever it is
tried to kill you

01:21.783 --> 01:23.350
is working
with a dirty-ass guard.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.927
Michael,
what the hell is going on?

01:33.995 --> 01:35.095
You went to see Fiona,
what?

01:35.162 --> 01:36.463
Uh,
yesterday afternoon,

01:36.530 --> 01:38.932
and you never bothered
to call me afterwards?

01:40.268 --> 01:43.069
I've been a little busy.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.372
Well, how is she?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.574
She's, uh, holding up.

01:47.642 --> 01:50.877
That may be
the most evasive answer

01:50.945 --> 01:53.880
you have ever given me,
and you can be pretty evasive.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.515
Maddy, how you doing?
Good to see you.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.150
Mike, I'll, uh,
meet you in the car.

02:00.621 --> 02:04.124
She's important to me,
too, Michael.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.497
She's tired...
she's scared...

02:10.564 --> 02:13.166
and she's not
eating enough.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.001
And somebody's
trying to kill her.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.270
Who?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.272
Probably Anson.
We found a middle man.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.442
He's a dirty prison guard
living down in the Everglades.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.544
That's where
we're heading to now.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.980
Do you think
he'll tell you anything?

02:27.048 --> 02:29.115
I know he will.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.128
Wake up, Sammy.
We're here.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.707
Okay, so, this guy
is just a prison guard, right?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.176
So that's an hour
to get the answers,

02:56.243 --> 02:57.911
four-hour drive
back to Miami --

02:57.979 --> 02:59.579
Sam, you got
someplace to be?

02:59.647 --> 03:01.982
Yeah. I'm taking Elsa
to dinner tonight.

03:02.049 --> 03:05.485
1 out of every 10
is on me.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.620
<i>When you need to</i>
<i>capture a target in a building,</i>

03:07.688 --> 03:09.589
<i>one of the most</i>
<i>effective techniques</i>

03:09.657 --> 03:11.858
<i>is known as</i>
<i>the hammer and anvil.</i>

03:11.926 --> 03:14.527
<i>First, your team</i>
<i>surrounds the structure,</i>

03:14.595 --> 03:16.730
<i>sealing off all the exits.</i>

03:20.868 --> 03:22.035
<i>Then you enter</i>
<i>from all points at once,</i>

03:22.103 --> 03:25.171
<i>quickly and quietly.</i>

03:25.239 --> 03:26.740
<i>The goal is to</i>
<i>find your target fast enough</i>

03:26.807 --> 03:29.876
<i>to avoid a standoff</i>
<i>or a fire fight.</i>

03:29.944 --> 03:31.578
<i>It's hard to</i>
<i>interrogate your target</i>

03:31.645 --> 03:33.279
<i>if he's dealing</i>
<i>with a gunshot wound.</i>

03:33.347 --> 03:36.182
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it's even harder if he's dead.</i>

03:36.250 --> 03:38.251
See anything?
Nothing.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.886
Sam.

03:39.954 --> 03:42.856
Sam, in the living room!
We got a body!

03:43.958 --> 03:46.893
Rebecca.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.294
Yell, and you're dead.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.630
Okay. You win. Go.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.531
You first.

03:52.967 --> 03:53.933
Sam!

03:56.203 --> 03:57.704
Rebecca,
you don't need to do this.

03:57.772 --> 04:00.340
Don't tell me what I need.
I'm calling the shots here.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.146
Sam!

04:06.213 --> 04:07.514
Put your guns down now!

04:07.581 --> 04:08.548
Rebecca,
don't do this.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.785
I said guns down,
or he dies.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.826
Okay. Get in the car.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.930
Drive.

Want to listen

You can pick the station.
No, thanks.

You picked me 'cause

05:06.522 --> 05:07.956
That's it.

05:08.024 --> 05:09.191
Oh, boy.
It's my curse.

05:09.258 --> 05:10.926
I'm just too handsome
for my own good.

05:10.993 --> 05:13.261
Where's your phone?
We need to make a call.

05:13.329 --> 05:15.330
Where do you
think it is?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.199
I mean,
I'd get it, but...

05:27.543 --> 05:29.478
Sam, are you --

05:29.545 --> 05:31.313
It's me, Michael.

05:32.682 --> 05:35.383
Rebecca, you didn't want to
stick around to chat?

05:35.451 --> 05:37.486
No. Nothing personal.

05:37.553 --> 05:39.554
And, uh,
sorry about the Charger.

05:39.622 --> 05:41.490
More concerned
about my friend.

05:41.557 --> 05:42.724
Yeah, about that.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.726
I'm keeping Sam
for a while.

05:44.794 --> 05:46.728
I'll release him
the moment I'm home free.

05:46.796 --> 05:48.563
But until then,
I don't want to see your face

05:48.631 --> 05:49.965
or any
of your CIA friends.

05:50.032 --> 05:52.434
You do anything stupid,
I dump Sam's body in the swamp.

05:56.839 --> 05:59.407
I like the part
about letting Sam go.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.310
Yeah, if you want to
trust a woman

06:02.378 --> 06:03.879
who betrayed the CIA
and tried to send you

06:03.946 --> 06:05.313
on a one-way trip
to Liberia.

06:05.381 --> 06:07.315
Good point.
What's the plan?

06:07.383 --> 06:08.750
There's only one way
out of this area.

06:08.818 --> 06:12.387
We hit the road,
and we track her down.

06:44.220 --> 06:47.622
Glenanne, it's chow time.
Let's get moving.

06:47.690 --> 06:48.924
I'm not hungry.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.992
Didn't ask you
if you were hungry.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.941
<i>When you're marked for death</i>
<i>in prison,</i>

07:06.008 --> 07:08.777
<i>you're always</i>
<i>anticipating the next fight.</i>

07:08.844 --> 07:11.379
<i>The earlier you spot</i>
<i>a potential adversary,</i>

07:11.447 --> 07:13.582
<i>the better</i>
<i>you can defend yourself.</i>

07:13.649 --> 07:16.151
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>that's not always enough.</i>

07:16.219 --> 07:18.920
<i>If you realize</i>
<i>you have multiple attackers</i>

07:18.988 --> 07:20.655
<i>coming at you</i>
<i>in a coordinated assault,</i>

07:20.723 --> 07:23.692
<i>just defending yourself</i>
<i>won't work.</i>

07:23.759 --> 07:25.794
<i>The only move is to attack.</i>

07:27.230 --> 07:28.997
Aah!

07:40.810 --> 07:42.177
What's going on
down there?

07:43.145 --> 07:44.679
Keep the line moving,
ladies.

07:44.747 --> 07:47.682
Move!

08:02.131 --> 08:03.798
Vicodin.

08:03.866 --> 08:05.033
I don't usually
offer sale prices.

08:05.101 --> 08:07.235
But for you, 10 bucks.

08:07.303 --> 08:08.803
Looks like
you need it.

08:12.008 --> 08:13.308
What I need is to know

08:13.376 --> 08:15.977
how those women managed
to get switchblades in prison.

08:16.045 --> 08:19.014
The sisters can get their hands
on pretty much anything.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.282
They're lifers.

08:20.349 --> 08:22.617
They do contract hits
to pass the time.

08:22.685 --> 08:24.286
Same way
some girls knit.

08:24.353 --> 08:25.787
Whoever's trying
to kill you,

08:25.855 --> 08:27.889
they don't care about
keeping it quiet anymore.

08:27.957 --> 08:29.357
Not if they
hired those bitches.

08:35.331 --> 08:37.399
My friend is working hard
to get me out of here.

08:37.466 --> 08:39.234
But first, I have to survive.
You got to help me, Ayn.

08:39.302 --> 08:41.836
Oh, sorry, criminal.
Not this time.

08:41.904 --> 08:43.104
Not with
those two involved.

08:43.172 --> 08:44.406
I might die in prison,

08:44.473 --> 08:46.775
but I'd vastly prefer it
be of natural causes.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.015
I need the listing
of a helicopter tour company

08:54.083 --> 08:55.083
near Flamingo.

08:55.151 --> 08:58.420
Yes.
Please connect me.

08:58.487 --> 09:00.322
Good morning.

09:00.389 --> 09:03.191
My husband and I are looking
to take a helicopter tour.

09:03.259 --> 09:06.027
Do you have anything
this afternoon?

09:06.095 --> 09:08.697
Becky Buckner.

09:08.764 --> 09:11.700
And where exactly
are you located?

09:11.767 --> 09:14.903
Terrific.
We'll see you then.

09:14.970 --> 09:16.771
Helicopter ride?
That sounds fun.

09:16.839 --> 09:18.640
Pull over.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.581
Pee break?

09:26.649 --> 09:27.749
We need a ride
your friends <i>haven't</i> seen.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.850
I'm going car shopping.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.719
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:30.786 --> 09:31.920
Shooting someone
on the highway

09:31.987 --> 09:33.088
in the middle
of the afternoon?

09:33.155 --> 09:34.155
That's a bad idea.

09:34.223 --> 09:35.790
I didn't ask
for your opinion.

09:35.858 --> 09:37.492
You drop a body on the highway,
someone's gonna see it.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.661
That means cops.
That means manhunt.

09:39.729 --> 09:41.396
You want to get away clean,
right?

09:41.464 --> 09:42.330
And what do you suggest?

09:56.912 --> 09:58.747
- Hey. How you doing?
- You okay?

09:58.814 --> 10:00.849
Yeah, well, you can see
we got a flat here.

10:00.916 --> 10:02.417
But wouldn't you know it,
the stupid jack is busted.

10:02.485 --> 10:05.120
And problem is,
my wife has heat stroke,

10:05.187 --> 10:07.088
and the heat's getting
pretty bad here, so...

10:07.156 --> 10:08.623
I got a jack.
You can use mine.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.225
Oh, great. Thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

10:10.292 --> 10:11.326
Thanks for stopping.

10:16.832 --> 10:17.932
Ow! What the hell?!

10:18.000 --> 10:18.833
Stay quiet.
If you want my --

10:18.901 --> 10:20.135
shut up. Now.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.503
We only have
a few seconds,

10:21.570 --> 10:23.037
so you can't
ask any questions.

10:23.105 --> 10:25.106
Now, that woman over there --
she kidnapped me.

10:25.174 --> 10:26.674
She's got a gun.
You gonna kill me?

10:26.742 --> 10:27.976
No questions.

10:28.043 --> 10:29.778
Okay, now, there's a guy
who's gonna find you.

10:29.845 --> 10:30.945
His name
is Michael Westen.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.383
Got that? Repeat it.
Helicopter tour.

10:35.451 --> 10:37.619
And I'll be taking these.
Do we have a problem?

10:37.686 --> 10:39.287
No. We have keys.

10:39.355 --> 10:40.488
I was just
thanking our friend here

10:40.556 --> 10:41.923
for generously
donating his truck.

10:41.991 --> 10:43.625
We appreciate it,
sir.

10:45.628 --> 10:47.829
Was that
really necessary?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.197
Shove him in the trunk
of the car.

10:49.265 --> 10:50.932
Let's get
the hell out of here.

10:54.996 --> 10:56.263
All right, figure we left the
house 15 minutes after they did.

10:56.331 --> 10:57.765
Sam's trying to stall.

10:57.832 --> 11:01.435
You're driving...fast.

11:01.503 --> 11:03.137
Just wish we had some way
of knowing

11:03.204 --> 11:04.438
we were still
on their tail.

11:04.506 --> 11:05.673
Like Rebecca's car?

11:05.740 --> 11:08.042
That'll work.

11:29.064 --> 11:32.466
She wanted to kill me.
I could tell.

11:32.534 --> 11:34.068
There wasn't nothing
behind those eyes.

11:34.135 --> 11:35.402
Like a damn barracuda.

11:35.470 --> 11:38.405
What about the guy with her?
Did he say anything?

11:38.473 --> 11:39.607
Depends.
You Michael Westen?

11:39.674 --> 11:41.108
Yeah.

11:41.176 --> 11:43.177
He said to tell you,
"helicopter tour."

11:44.679 --> 11:45.879
She was closing in,
and...

11:45.947 --> 11:47.281
Did I mention her eyes?

11:47.349 --> 11:48.749
Yeah.
Like a barracuda. You did.

11:48.817 --> 11:50.684
Tell you what.
Here. You sit tight.

11:50.752 --> 11:51.785
We'll get you a cab.

11:51.853 --> 11:53.487
Get yourself
a steak dinner, okay?

11:53.555 --> 11:55.723
The closest helicopter-tour
place is in Flamingo.

11:55.790 --> 11:56.957
It's about
an hour away.

11:57.025 --> 11:58.726
An hour away?
Take old Porter road.

11:58.793 --> 11:59.660
You can make it there
in 40.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.564
Get some dessert,
too.

12:06.735 --> 12:09.970
Rebecca,
I know you're not a big talker,

12:10.038 --> 12:12.072
but I got to ask.
Why you doing this?

12:12.140 --> 12:14.942
Mike showed me your CIA file.
You were a model agent.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.877
Is this where you tell me
that deep down inside,

12:16.945 --> 12:18.679
I'm just a girl scout?

12:18.747 --> 12:20.514
I just figured
you were smart enough to realize

12:20.582 --> 12:21.949
that your buddy Anson
is on the run.

12:22.017 --> 12:23.617
He's out of strings
to pull,

12:23.685 --> 12:26.053
and here you are
sticking with the losing team.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.288
Seems like you're forgetting
who's holding the gun.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.391
Honestly, I just don't
understand the guy's appeal.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.992
And what's
the big picture here?

12:32.060 --> 12:33.360
You try and
take out Fi --

12:33.428 --> 12:34.962
Okay, okay.
Enough with the questions.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.764
Step on it.
You sure?

12:36.831 --> 12:38.599
I said,
"step on it."

12:38.667 --> 12:41.201
<i>There's a reason spies</i>

12:41.269 --> 12:44.672
<i>try to stick to the speed limit</i>
<i>in operations.</i>

12:44.739 --> 12:46.840
<i>When the stakes</i>
<i>are high enough,</i>

12:46.908 --> 12:49.510
<i>a simple speeding ticket</i>
<i>can be a life-or-death matter</i>

12:49.577 --> 12:51.712
<i>for you</i>
<i>or for the police officer</i>

12:51.780 --> 12:52.846
<i>who's just trying</i>
<i>to do his job.</i>

12:59.287 --> 13:01.055
You said,
"step on it."

13:07.095 --> 13:08.696
I knew I should have
shot that fisherman.

13:08.763 --> 13:10.564
If he reported
this truck stolen --

13:10.632 --> 13:12.633
We took his phone,
and we left him in a trunk.

13:12.701 --> 13:14.935
You think he reported us
with telepathy?

13:15.003 --> 13:16.470
We'd know for sure
if he was dead.

13:16.538 --> 13:18.338
Just relax. The officer's just
making us sweat a little.

13:20.275 --> 13:22.910
Either you get rid of him
or I do.

13:22.977 --> 13:25.779
Okay. Just let me
deal with this.

13:29.984 --> 13:32.886
License
and registration.

13:32.954 --> 13:35.022
Good afternoon, Officer.
How you doing?

13:37.225 --> 13:39.093
There you go.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.131
Sam Axe?

13:44.199 --> 13:45.699
Yes, sir.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.701
Can I ask why
you're driving a truck

13:47.769 --> 13:49.336
that belongs
to Edward Rousch?

13:49.404 --> 13:51.038
Oh, well,
Ed's my boss.

13:51.106 --> 13:52.473
I'm just borrowing it.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.508
Then we need
to give him a call.

13:56.111 --> 13:57.711
Um...

13:57.779 --> 13:58.979
Okay, well,
that's a problem,

13:59.047 --> 14:01.181
see, 'cause if Ed finds out
about this car,

14:01.249 --> 14:03.517
he'll know
where his wife is.

14:03.585 --> 14:06.653
Now, I'm sure you
get an earful all day long

14:06.721 --> 14:08.655
about
people's sob stories --

14:08.723 --> 14:10.023
Don't bother.

14:10.091 --> 14:12.760
You were driving
25 miles over the speed limit.

14:12.827 --> 14:14.795
What are we gonna do?
Ed's gonna lose it.

14:14.863 --> 14:16.163
Don't worry about it.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.499
We will get you to your sister's
or someplace safe.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.666
Okay.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.301
Her husband
has a horrible temper.

14:21.369 --> 14:23.237
Sorry.
Not my concern.

14:23.304 --> 14:25.005
He's gonna kill me
if he finds me this time.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.440
I'm dead!

14:26.508 --> 14:29.676
Look, I know it was a bad idea
to take Ed's truck.

14:29.744 --> 14:33.147
But mine was in the shop.
And, well, just...

14:33.214 --> 14:36.817
seeing a lady like this,
sweet and innocent

14:36.885 --> 14:38.085
getting knocked around
like that,

14:38.153 --> 14:39.887
you think I'm just
gonna sit on my hands?

14:39.954 --> 14:41.755
Officer, please.
Look, if this one time,

14:41.823 --> 14:44.558
if you could just
look the other way,

14:44.626 --> 14:46.226
boy, would we
sure appreciate it.

14:52.167 --> 14:53.433
Just watch the lead foot,
will you?

14:54.736 --> 14:56.637
Yes, sir.
I'm not the only cop on the road.

14:56.704 --> 14:58.605
Thank you, Officer.

15:02.677 --> 15:05.345
There you go.
Not even a ticket.

15:05.413 --> 15:06.880
Now, you gonna go back
to threatening the guy

15:06.948 --> 15:08.148
who just saved your ass?

15:08.216 --> 15:10.083
Stop fishing
for compliments.

15:10.151 --> 15:11.185
Let's get going.

15:21.296 --> 15:24.131
I do love winning,
but it's less fun

15:24.199 --> 15:25.732
if you aren't paying
enough attention to notice.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.868
The guards don't even
look at those two.

15:27.936 --> 15:29.369
The sisters
don't get watched.

15:29.437 --> 15:31.905
They don't get searched,
either.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.073
They could own
the whole block

15:33.141 --> 15:34.541
with what they've got
in their cells.

15:34.609 --> 15:35.609
And those guards
know it.

15:35.677 --> 15:36.844
They're just too scared
or too dirty

15:36.911 --> 15:38.312
to go looking for it.

15:38.379 --> 15:39.913
And what if their cells
would get tossed?

15:39.981 --> 15:41.315
What then?
Those two would be getting their meals

15:41.382 --> 15:43.584
through a chuck hole
for months.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.085
But the only way
that's gonna happen

15:45.153 --> 15:46.353
is a
block-wide shakedown.

15:46.421 --> 15:48.021
You get enough guards
down here at once,

15:48.089 --> 15:49.156
all bets are off.

15:49.224 --> 15:50.791
Sounds like
I need a shakedown.

15:50.859 --> 15:52.059
Can you arrange that?

15:52.126 --> 15:55.629
Could I? Sure.
Will I? Hell no.

15:55.697 --> 15:58.131
No reason to lose everything
in <i>my</i> cell.

15:58.199 --> 16:00.601
I would compensate you
for your losses.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.604
Listen, criminal,
I like you,

16:03.671 --> 16:05.672
but I like
my business more.

16:05.740 --> 16:08.408
Your move.

16:08.476 --> 16:10.410
You have to
have a price.

16:13.181 --> 16:15.215
Fine.

16:15.283 --> 16:17.251
Maybe
there is something.

16:17.318 --> 16:19.386
You got people in Miami,
right?

16:19.454 --> 16:21.922
My ex-husband
has this package.

16:21.990 --> 16:24.625
Need it picked up,
delivered here.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.927
A package?
What's the catch?

16:26.995 --> 16:28.295
The catch is my ex.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.731
Winner of biggest bastard
in Florida 40 years running.

16:30.798 --> 16:32.933
My friends
are very resourceful.

16:34.135 --> 16:35.502
My deliveries come in

16:35.570 --> 16:37.304
through the 9:00 a.m.
guard shift change.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.072
If my package
makes it here by then,

16:39.140 --> 16:40.207
you'll get your shakedown.

16:40.275 --> 16:41.275
And the sisters --

16:41.342 --> 16:42.576
they'll be on their way
to the hole.

16:42.644 --> 16:43.510
Deal.

16:50.451 --> 16:51.785
Hello?

16:51.853 --> 16:54.254
You have a collect call
from an inmate

16:54.322 --> 16:55.489
at Allarod
federal penitentiary.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.190
This call will be
recorded and monitored.

16:57.258 --> 16:59.326
Press 1 to accept.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.329
Fiona, honey?

17:02.397 --> 17:04.897
Madeline, it's good
to hear your voice.

17:04.965 --> 17:06.700
You, too!

17:06.768 --> 17:09.036
Are you okay?
You know Michael.

17:09.103 --> 17:10.871
I barely got two words
out of him.

17:10.939 --> 17:15.309
I'm fine. I need to get
a message to Michael.

17:15.376 --> 17:17.210
It's urgent.
Honey, Michael's in the Everglades

17:17.278 --> 17:20.213
working on, uh, well,
something we probably

17:20.281 --> 17:22.316
shouldn't be talking about
on this line.

17:22.383 --> 17:23.684
This has to happen fast,
otherwise --

17:23.751 --> 17:25.719
Okay, listen.
Give me the details, all right?

17:25.787 --> 17:27.186
We'll work it out.
He needs to pick up a package

17:27.255 --> 17:29.690
and bring it
to the prison.

17:32.994 --> 17:34.828
All right.
Swamp Hawks Helicopter Tours.

17:34.896 --> 17:37.798
Looks like
we got here first.

17:37.865 --> 17:40.934
This place couldn't be worse
for setting a trap to grab Sam.

17:41.002 --> 17:42.970
Maybe if we
hide behind that shack?

17:43.037 --> 17:45.405
Not enough cover.
Maybe those trees.

17:45.473 --> 17:48.375
Nah. They won't pass
close enough to the trees.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.177
You're right.
We need to get to that chopper.

17:50.244 --> 17:51.845
Okay,
I think the pilot

17:51.913 --> 17:53.880
might have something to say
about that.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.449
I'll take care of him.
You hide the car.

18:06.227 --> 18:07.361
Afternoon.
How's it going?

18:07.428 --> 18:08.795
Can I help you?

18:08.863 --> 18:10.397
Yep.
Derek Huber, FAA.

18:10.465 --> 18:13.266
Bill Padover.
What's going on?

18:13.334 --> 18:14.768
Some
ridiculous complaints.

18:14.836 --> 18:17.404
Thought I'd come down here
and check it out in person.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.439
Complaints? About me?
Yeah.

18:19.507 --> 18:21.641
Clipping trees,
landing near power lines,

18:21.709 --> 18:22.809
that kind of thing.
What?

18:22.877 --> 18:23.910
I already
pulled your file, Bill.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.413
This doesn't
sound like you at all.

18:26.481 --> 18:27.781
Exactly.
I would never do that.

18:27.849 --> 18:28.949
Who made
those complaints?

18:29.017 --> 18:31.785
Oh, some folks last week
from up north?

18:31.853 --> 18:34.988
Uh, t-the couple
from Virginia?

18:35.056 --> 18:36.490
The couple
from Virginia.

18:36.557 --> 18:38.425
They also reported that you
had booze on your breath?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.494
They --
they said I was drunk?

18:40.561 --> 18:43.030
Bill, I'm on <i>your</i> side.
It's their word against ours.

18:43.097 --> 18:44.798
Help me fill out this report.
You got your Level Five?

18:44.866 --> 18:46.900
My Level Five?
That's at home.

18:46.968 --> 18:47.868
Oh,
you better go get it.

18:47.935 --> 18:49.036
Now?
No, I have a tour.

18:49.103 --> 18:50.637
Already
postponed it.

18:50.705 --> 18:52.172
Talked to the gal
at the front desk.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.640
Good news is
she's got your back.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.142
Disputed the worst
of the complaints.

18:55.209 --> 18:57.744
Worst complaints?
What are you talking about?

18:57.812 --> 18:59.479
You don't even
want to know, Bill.

18:59.547 --> 19:02.182
These jackasses don't realize
your career is at stake!

19:02.250 --> 19:03.650
Clock's ticking.

19:03.718 --> 19:04.718
How long is it gonna take you
to get to your house?

19:06.187 --> 19:07.988
I can be back in 45 minutes.
Let's do it.

19:08.056 --> 19:11.792
Thanks for your help.
Sure.

19:24.005 --> 19:26.673
Thanks for driving.
Let's go.

19:26.741 --> 19:28.542
Where we flying to?

19:28.609 --> 19:30.777
I'll worry about that.
Okay.

19:30.845 --> 19:32.579
First, we get out of here,
then I'll figure out what's next.

19:32.647 --> 19:34.981
You just smile
and be on your best behavior.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.783
Or you shoot me?

19:36.851 --> 19:39.352
Honey,
you're learning.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.089
Hi. Welcome to Swamp Hawks.
Y'all have an appointment?

19:43.156 --> 19:44.090
Yes. Hi.
I called earlier.

19:44.157 --> 19:45.691
Becky Buckner.

19:45.759 --> 19:47.660
Oh, sure thing.
Oh, this must be your husband.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.895
Hi, there.
I'm Marydale.

19:48.962 --> 19:50.696
Hi. I'm Chuck.
Nice to meet you.

19:50.764 --> 19:51.664
Well, your copter
is spit polished

19:51.732 --> 19:53.065
and all ready to go,

19:53.133 --> 19:55.768
so you just have to fill out
a little paperwork, please.

19:55.836 --> 19:57.770
Oh, uh, well,
Becky just loves paperwork,

19:57.838 --> 19:59.872
don't you, dear?

19:59.940 --> 20:02.508
Oh, well,
that's okay, Chucky.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.377
You can just
take care of this one for me.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.512
Is the chopper
fully fueled

20:06.580 --> 20:07.747
in case we want to
stay out longer?

20:07.814 --> 20:09.615
Oh, okay. Can do.

20:09.683 --> 20:10.950
Costs a little extra,

20:11.018 --> 20:12.752
but you can't
put a price on a memory.

20:12.819 --> 20:14.053
Oh.

20:14.121 --> 20:15.655
Well, neither of us
are gonna forget today.

20:15.722 --> 20:16.923
That's for sure.
Mm-hmm.

20:18.158 --> 20:20.359
<i>As any</i>
<i>crisis negotiator knows,</i>

20:20.427 --> 20:23.796
<i>only about one in five hostages</i>
<i>survives a rescue attempt.</i>

20:23.864 --> 20:25.197
<i>If you're the hostage,</i>

20:25.265 --> 20:27.466
<i>you'd like to</i>
<i>improve those odds,</i>

20:27.534 --> 20:30.870
<i>which means figuring out</i>
<i>where your rescue's coming from</i>

20:30.938 --> 20:33.506
<i>and getting yourself</i>
<i>out of the line of fire.</i>

20:33.573 --> 20:34.774
<i>Of course, if your captor</i>

20:34.841 --> 20:36.275
<i>is every bit as trained</i>
<i>as you are,</i>

20:36.343 --> 20:38.811
<i>even the slightest attempt</i>
<i>to adjust your position</i>

20:38.879 --> 20:40.146
<i>might be noticed.</i>

20:40.213 --> 20:42.949
Don't you want to
walk next to me, Chuck?

20:43.016 --> 20:44.750
It's such a special day.

20:44.818 --> 20:46.485
Marydale, is there any chance
we can get a photo

20:46.553 --> 20:47.753
with the pilot
before we take off?

20:47.821 --> 20:49.388
You know,
for the scrapbook.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.558
Oh, of course, sweetie.
Bill, come out for a photo.

20:55.362 --> 20:58.631
Bill, you got cotton
in your ears?

20:58.699 --> 21:01.600
I don't know what's up
with Bill.

21:01.668 --> 21:02.835
I might have an idea.

21:16.516 --> 21:19.118
You know the problem
with our relationship?

21:19.186 --> 21:21.821
I hate your friends.
Come on.

21:24.624 --> 21:27.727
Jesse, run!

21:43.486 --> 21:45.053
You trying
to make me shoot you?

21:45.121 --> 21:47.088
All you had to do
was get on that chopper.

21:47.156 --> 21:48.890
Oh, yeah. I'm supposed to
trust you, right?

21:48.958 --> 21:51.059
Yeah, it worked out great
for the prison guard, didn't it?

21:51.127 --> 21:53.428
Not to mention anyone
who ran into your friend Anson.

21:53.496 --> 21:55.297
He's not my friend.
Oh, yeah. Okay.

21:55.364 --> 21:57.466
Your friend, your --
your partner, whatever.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.101
We all know what happens
when you're done with people.

22:00.169 --> 22:01.536
I can be done with you
right now.

22:01.604 --> 22:02.871
Yeah,
you know what?

22:02.939 --> 22:04.439
Maybe you should just go ahead
and pull that trigger.

22:04.507 --> 22:06.575
That way you won't have anything
to hold over Mike anymore

22:06.642 --> 22:08.376
and you can just add me
to that list of bodies

22:08.444 --> 22:09.578
you've been dropping --
Shut up.

22:09.645 --> 22:12.214
How many is it, huh?
Shut up! I said shut up!

22:12.281 --> 22:15.116
You think you know me?
You don't know anything.

22:15.184 --> 22:16.485
I never wanted
any of this.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.720
I work for Anson
because if I don't,

22:18.788 --> 22:21.690
my brother dies.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.492
I didn't know that.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.894
Shut up.

22:27.129 --> 22:28.730
Damn it!

22:32.735 --> 22:34.402
I'll see
if I can slow her down.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.480
Hold on.

22:54.991 --> 22:56.925
Hang on.

22:58.494 --> 23:01.029
Mike, this thing
is held together with duct tape.

23:01.097 --> 23:03.765
She's not getting away.

23:03.833 --> 23:05.100
Rocks! Rocks!

23:13.843 --> 23:14.776
That doesn't
sound good.

23:14.844 --> 23:15.810
It'll be okay.

23:22.718 --> 23:24.052
And there goes
the radiator.

23:26.956 --> 23:28.056
Damn it!

23:28.124 --> 23:29.624
Mike, seriously,
it's time to call the CIA.

23:29.692 --> 23:31.326
We're not
calling the CIA!

23:31.394 --> 23:33.662
We're not calling
the police!

23:33.729 --> 23:36.264
If she sees a road block,
she'd kill Sam.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.332
He's better off
on his own.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.633
Well,
in case you hadn't noticed,

23:38.701 --> 23:39.935
right now,
he <i>is</i> on his own.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.403
That's why we need
to fix the car and find him.

23:41.470 --> 23:42.637
Right. Right.

23:42.705 --> 23:44.773
Well, the good news is
we got her cornered

23:44.840 --> 23:46.341
in the world's
biggest swamp.

23:46.409 --> 23:48.843
A little help?

23:59.755 --> 24:02.824
I made the call.

24:02.892 --> 24:04.059
You'll get
your package.

24:04.126 --> 24:07.395
Look at you.
A mover <i>and</i> a shaker.

24:07.463 --> 24:09.831
I guess the question is,
<i>when's</i> it getting here?

24:09.899 --> 24:11.166
Well, I told them
about the shift change,

24:11.233 --> 24:13.034
but it may
take a little longer.

24:13.102 --> 24:15.337
Whenever's fine with me.
I got nothing <i>but</i> time.

24:15.404 --> 24:16.938
But if it gets here
after 9:00,

24:17.006 --> 24:19.507
you'll be spending another day
dodging the sisters.

24:19.575 --> 24:21.576
That's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

24:21.644 --> 24:23.778
I need the cell tossed
as soon as possible.

24:23.846 --> 24:25.347
If you can call
for the shakedown <i>first --</i>

24:26.616 --> 24:27.816
That's not how it happens,
criminal.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.017
Do you think
I built this business

24:29.085 --> 24:30.118
by working on credit?

24:30.186 --> 24:31.720
We're only talking
a few hours.

24:31.787 --> 24:33.021
We're not
changing the deal.

24:33.089 --> 24:35.523
And a little
free business advice --

24:35.591 --> 24:38.093
never negotiate
from a position of weakness.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.162
I hope your friends
are as good as you say.

24:55.011 --> 24:57.412
<i>This is Michael.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

25:17.099 --> 25:18.566
You lost, grandma?

25:18.634 --> 25:22.971
Um, you don't know me.
Ayn sent me. I'm here --

25:23.039 --> 25:24.005
I know
what you're here for.

25:27.410 --> 25:29.010
Come in.

25:29.078 --> 25:30.812
Thank you.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.215
So, uh,
do you have it?

25:34.283 --> 25:37.719
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Of course.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.087
So,
how you know Ayn?

25:39.155 --> 25:43.858
Oh, uh, she's...
a friend of a friend.

25:48.064 --> 25:49.531
Would you mind?

25:49.598 --> 25:51.132
Could I have
one of your cigarettes?

25:51.200 --> 25:52.467
Sure.
You can have a cigarette.

25:52.535 --> 25:54.903
Thanks.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.905
But you know
what you <i>can't</i> have?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.007
You can't
have the package.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.343
What was Ayn thinking,
huh, sending an old lady?

26:02.411 --> 26:03.578
She thought I was gonna
feel sorry for you?

26:05.648 --> 26:07.215
Look, I can't leave here
without it.

26:08.951 --> 26:11.786
If you need money, I can --
Shut up!

26:11.854 --> 26:14.289
The last guy who came here
for this package

26:14.356 --> 26:16.658
left here
without his teeth.

26:19.295 --> 26:20.595
Don't worry.

26:20.663 --> 26:23.865
I'm gonna leave your teeth
right where they are

26:23.933 --> 26:25.967
so you can give Ayn
a message for me.

26:26.035 --> 26:28.169
Tell that bitch
if she wants her stuff,

26:28.237 --> 26:30.071
she better come
and get it herself.

26:30.139 --> 26:33.808
Now, get out of here.

26:52.895 --> 26:55.263
Looks like
we found a ride.

26:55.331 --> 26:59.033
Uh, something tells me
those airboats are <i>not</i> for sale.

26:59.101 --> 27:00.668
I'm a pretty good
negotiator.

27:00.736 --> 27:03.104
Oh, boy.
What now?

27:03.172 --> 27:05.507
You see the industrial
air filtration system?

27:05.574 --> 27:06.741
The chemical vats?

27:06.809 --> 27:08.510
That means our rednecks
are either opening up

27:08.577 --> 27:10.578
a dry cleaners in
the middle of fricking nowhere

27:10.646 --> 27:11.880
or they're cooking meth,

27:11.947 --> 27:14.015
which means after
they shoot you in the face,

27:14.083 --> 27:15.784
they're not gonna be
too friendly

27:15.851 --> 27:17.485
to the guy zip-tied
in the truck.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.987
If I'm shot
in the face,

27:19.054 --> 27:20.355
I don't think I'll care too much
how nice they are to you.

27:20.422 --> 27:21.456
Okay, wait.

27:21.524 --> 27:23.091
How about
if we come up with a plan

27:23.159 --> 27:25.527
where <i>nobody</i>
<i>gets dead, okay?</i>

27:25.594 --> 27:27.195
Just wait
for the rednecks

27:27.263 --> 27:29.230
to go back inside
their crappy trailer

27:29.298 --> 27:31.432
and we'll pretend
that it's a police raid.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.234
Actually,
I got a better idea.

27:33.302 --> 27:35.336
And you'll be happy to know
it <i>doesn't</i> involve guns.

27:37.339 --> 27:39.808
<i>The standard M112</i>
<i>demolition charge</i>

27:39.875 --> 27:42.143
<i>contains 1.25 pounds of C-4.</i>

27:42.211 --> 27:44.846
<i>When the charge</i>
<i>is detonated,</i>

27:44.914 --> 27:47.448
<i>the explosive is converted</i>
<i>into compressed gas,</i>

27:47.516 --> 27:49.617
<i>and the shock wave</i>
<i>rips through anything</i>

27:49.685 --> 27:51.719
<i>within 16 feet,</i>

27:51.787 --> 27:53.421
<i>which means that if</i>
<i>five of those charges</i>

27:53.489 --> 27:55.557
<i>are in your backpack,</i>

27:55.624 --> 27:59.027
<i>anyone within a city block</i>
<i>is in your blast radius, too.</i>

28:04.366 --> 28:07.602
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, guys, easy.

28:07.670 --> 28:09.537
Don't shoot.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.039
You see the sign?

28:11.106 --> 28:12.473
Oh, yeah,
I saw the sign.

28:12.541 --> 28:15.777
Guys, we need to talk.

28:18.921 --> 28:20.455
You must
have a death wish.

28:20.523 --> 28:22.424
Uh, no. No.
Not at all.

28:22.491 --> 28:24.793
I just think the best way
to explain things to you guys

28:24.860 --> 28:27.696
is to look
in my backpack.

28:27.763 --> 28:28.730
And be gentle.

28:35.304 --> 28:38.006
What the hell is it?

28:38.074 --> 28:40.508
Uh, well,
that's five bricks of C-4.

28:41.243 --> 28:43.845
That's enough explosive
to make a very big crater

28:43.913 --> 28:46.614
right where we're standing
and leave tiny pieces of us

28:46.682 --> 28:48.450
all over your property.

28:48.517 --> 28:50.051
And you want to know
the <i>bad</i> news?

28:50.119 --> 28:52.487
The bad news is,
I don't even have the detonator.

28:53.789 --> 28:55.890
Psycho woman over there
in the truck,

28:55.958 --> 28:58.460
she decides
when we go boom.

28:58.527 --> 29:00.762
Think you can walk in here
with that bomb

29:00.830 --> 29:01.796
and rip <i>us</i> off?

29:01.864 --> 29:03.198
No, see,
here's the thing.

29:03.265 --> 29:04.933
She doesn't want your guns
or your drugs

29:05.000 --> 29:06.067
or your chemistry set.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.069
She just wants an airboat

29:08.137 --> 29:11.473
and for you guys to clear out
until after we're gone.

29:11.540 --> 29:14.709
Sounds to me like you're giving
us orders on our property!

29:14.777 --> 29:16.244
Oh, well --

29:23.452 --> 29:24.953
Make her stop shooting
right now!

29:25.020 --> 29:26.054
I can't!

29:26.122 --> 29:27.355
If she blows us all up,

29:27.423 --> 29:29.491
it's your fault
'cause I told you to run!

29:50.546 --> 29:53.715
Okay, you can stop
with the shooting!

29:59.688 --> 30:02.290
No one got dead.
Congrats.

30:02.358 --> 30:04.392
In retrospect,
I like your first plan better.

30:04.460 --> 30:06.427
Well,
there's always next time.

30:06.495 --> 30:09.464
I'm gonna go check on our ride.
Oh, and, uh, dear?

30:09.532 --> 30:11.566
Don't do
anything stupid.

30:29.685 --> 30:30.685
Hello?

30:30.753 --> 30:31.753
Yeah.
Mike, it's me.

30:31.821 --> 30:33.254
We only have
a couple seconds.

30:33.322 --> 30:34.489
Are you okay?
Where are you?

30:34.557 --> 30:36.357
Okay,
listen real careful.

30:36.425 --> 30:39.093
You take the first left
past mile marker 17.

30:39.161 --> 30:41.963
You go a couple of miles,
and you take a right,

30:42.031 --> 30:43.231
then you take
the third left.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.599
You go down
about a half a mile,

30:44.667 --> 30:46.734
and you see
a no-trespassing sign

30:46.802 --> 30:47.836
on a property
near the water.

30:47.903 --> 30:49.070
That's your gate.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.939
All right.
We'll find you.

30:51.006 --> 30:53.541
Mike, we're not gonna
be here long,

30:53.609 --> 30:56.845
so if we're not here,
call the CIA, call anyone,

30:56.912 --> 30:58.580
but we're gonna be
in an airboat.

30:58.647 --> 31:00.448
No, Sam.
We make those calls and --

31:00.516 --> 31:02.317
Mike, I'm gonna be dead
either way.

31:02.384 --> 31:05.053
Just get here as soon
as you can, okay, brother?

31:12.795 --> 31:14.929
<i>This is Elsa.</i>
<i>Get to it.</i>

31:16.031 --> 31:19.567
Hey, Elsa.
It's, uh, Sammy.

31:19.635 --> 31:22.337
Listen, um...

31:22.404 --> 31:23.872
I don't think I can
get there for dinner tonight,

31:23.939 --> 31:26.307
so, uh...

31:26.375 --> 31:30.745
I mean, I'll try
and call you later, but...

31:30.813 --> 31:34.182
in case I don't, uh...

31:34.250 --> 31:38.419
I just wanted to say
I-I love you, baby.

31:43.726 --> 31:47.195
And now you're calling
other girls?

31:47.263 --> 31:49.931
Here I thought
we had something special.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.309
You sure
it was the third left?

32:01.377 --> 32:02.710
I'm sure. Hang on.

32:12.354 --> 32:14.355
Right there.
Right there.

32:21.730 --> 32:22.730
Sam!

32:25.534 --> 32:26.901
Sam!

32:28.637 --> 32:29.671
Sam.

32:31.473 --> 32:32.807
Sam. Sam.

32:32.875 --> 32:35.009
Sam.

32:35.077 --> 32:36.444
You okay?

32:37.913 --> 32:40.348
Oh, yeah, I'm okay,
but Rebecca, she --

32:40.416 --> 32:43.051
she started a boat.
You guys can catch her.

32:43.118 --> 32:44.519
I'm on it. I'm on it.

32:44.586 --> 32:45.954
Where the hell's the --
what are you looking for?

32:46.021 --> 32:48.222
There was a backpack thingy.
It had a bomb in it.

32:48.290 --> 32:49.657
She made me wear it.

32:49.725 --> 32:50.992
She might have
taken it with her.

32:51.060 --> 32:52.193
Oh, crap.

32:52.261 --> 32:55.229
Mike, how bad is it?
Is Elsa gonna freak out?

32:55.297 --> 32:57.131
No, it looks fine.

32:57.199 --> 32:58.700
Thank God
she didn't hit my chin.

33:23.025 --> 33:25.460
<i>Airboats are built light</i>

33:25.527 --> 33:28.029
<i>with the least</i>
<i>material possible,</i>

33:28.097 --> 33:29.397
<i>which is great</i>
<i>if you want to skim quickly</i>

33:29.465 --> 33:30.698
<i>across the water.</i>

33:30.766 --> 33:34.502
<i>But it's problematic</i>
<i>in a gun fight</i>

33:34.570 --> 33:36.537
<i>when you don't have anything</i>
<i>to hide behind.</i>

33:36.605 --> 33:40.308
<i>You want to make sure</i>
<i>you fire first and last.</i>

33:41.677 --> 33:43.745
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>there's no need to hide</i>

33:43.812 --> 33:45.380
<i>when you've been</i>
<i>chasing a decoy.</i>

33:53.489 --> 33:54.889
Jesse?

33:54.957 --> 33:57.191
She's not on the boat.
She rigged it somehow.

33:57.259 --> 33:58.292
Where'd she go?

33:58.360 --> 34:00.261
No idea,
but she's not here.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.598
Well, if she's not on the boat,
how did she...

34:05.567 --> 34:07.235
Mike, you there?

34:07.302 --> 34:10.371
Sam.

34:12.574 --> 34:15.510
I think I found
where the backpack bomb is.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.385
Rebecca!

34:26.688 --> 34:28.489
Rebecca, you win!

34:28.556 --> 34:31.893
Putting the gun on the ground!

34:40.101 --> 34:41.702
Don't worry.

34:41.770 --> 34:44.205
I wasn't gonna detonate it
until you got a little closer.

34:45.841 --> 34:47.975
Get a little closer.

34:48.043 --> 34:49.877
I'm the one that you want.
Let Sam go.

34:49.945 --> 34:51.312
No, Mike. Stay there.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.916
Rebecca, listen to me.
You're making a big mistake.

34:54.983 --> 34:57.685
Sorry, Sam.
You're too late.

34:57.753 --> 34:59.954
Just listen to me!

35:00.022 --> 35:02.023
You hate Anson.

35:02.091 --> 35:03.791
You hate him
at least as much as we do.

35:03.859 --> 35:05.059
I saw it
in your eyes.

35:05.127 --> 35:08.162
But he's desperate now,
so how's this gonna end?

35:08.230 --> 35:10.531
He's either gonna kill you
or he's gonna

35:10.599 --> 35:12.700
keep using your brother
to manipulate you.

35:12.768 --> 35:13.768
Don't talk
about my brother!

35:13.836 --> 35:14.936
He's got
nothing to do with this!

35:15.003 --> 35:16.771
He's got
everything to do with it.

35:16.839 --> 35:19.907
Let us help you.
Help us take Anson down.

35:19.975 --> 35:21.209
We'll keep
your brother safe.

35:21.276 --> 35:22.710
You think
I'm gonna trust you?

35:22.778 --> 35:25.213
Come on.
You don't want to do this.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.714
You didn't shoot me
in the car.

35:26.782 --> 35:28.382
You didn't blow me up
an hour ago.

35:28.450 --> 35:30.785
Enough!
You don't know me!

35:30.853 --> 35:32.887
I do, Rebecca. I know you
better than you think.

35:34.690 --> 35:36.290
I know what it's like
to save someone close to you

35:36.358 --> 35:38.693
by selling your soul
a piece at a time.

35:38.760 --> 35:44.298
I know what it feels like
to wonder if there <i>is</i> a way out.

35:44.366 --> 35:45.933
You say you can't trust us.

35:46.001 --> 35:48.069
You can trust us
a hell of a lot more

35:48.137 --> 35:49.637
than you can trust Anson.

35:49.705 --> 35:53.908
There's only one way
to finish this for good.

35:53.976 --> 35:56.544
We have to
take him down together.

35:56.612 --> 36:00.314
There's nothing you can do.

36:00.382 --> 36:02.350
You're wrong.

36:02.417 --> 36:04.652
There's nothing
I <i>won't</i> do.

36:19.201 --> 36:20.401
Well,
that was easy.

36:25.119 --> 36:27.220
Michael,
you've been driving all night.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.752
You haven't even
changed your clothes.

36:28.865 --> 36:29.999
Are you sure
you want to do this?

36:30.066 --> 36:32.001
Knock on the door,
let him see you,

36:32.068 --> 36:33.269
and step to the side.

36:33.336 --> 36:34.403
Fiona said 9:00 a.m.

36:34.471 --> 36:35.738
Even if we left
in five minutes,

36:35.805 --> 36:36.939
it's not
gonna be enough --

36:37.007 --> 36:38.307
Knock on the door,
let him see you,

36:38.375 --> 36:39.241
and step to the side.

36:45.882 --> 36:47.716
Back again.

36:47.784 --> 36:51.487
You must not
like your teeth much, huh?

36:52.522 --> 36:53.922
Ohh!

36:53.990 --> 36:57.660
Aah, aah, aah!

36:57.727 --> 36:58.827
Where's the package?

36:58.895 --> 37:00.496
What package?!

37:00.563 --> 37:02.331
Aah!
Where is it?!

37:02.399 --> 37:05.501
There!
The left drawer!

37:05.568 --> 37:07.536
Aah!
It's locked.

37:07.604 --> 37:09.271
Where's the key?

37:09.339 --> 37:10.339
Okay, okay, okay!

37:10.407 --> 37:12.608
The jar.
There. There.

37:12.676 --> 37:15.511
Aah!

37:15.578 --> 37:18.647
I got it.

37:18.715 --> 37:20.249
It better be
the right key.

37:20.317 --> 37:21.317
Aah yeah.

37:21.384 --> 37:23.986
Is this it?

37:24.054 --> 37:25.054
Is this it?!

37:25.121 --> 37:26.221
Yeah!

37:26.289 --> 37:28.157
Michael, let's go.

37:30.427 --> 37:32.695
Michael,
we've got to go now!

37:32.762 --> 37:33.962
Aah!

37:34.030 --> 37:35.698
What the hell
was that for?!

37:35.765 --> 37:38.500
That was for my mom.

37:38.568 --> 37:40.903
Aah!

37:40.970 --> 37:43.138
Aah!

38:02.292 --> 38:05.461
<i>There are certain fights</i>
<i>you can't hope to win.</i>

38:05.528 --> 38:09.765
<i>Your only goal</i>
<i>is to not lose too badly.</i>

38:09.833 --> 38:13.001
Copy that.

38:13.069 --> 38:15.904
<i>Surviving a beating</i>
<i>from multiple attackers</i>

38:15.972 --> 38:17.473
<i>is about</i>
<i>avoiding the worst blows.</i>

38:17.540 --> 38:18.974
<i>You protect your head,</i>

38:19.042 --> 38:20.843
<i>do your best</i>
<i>to stay on your feet,</i>

38:20.910 --> 38:23.145
<i>and, most of all,</i>
<i>you hope for a miracle.</i>

38:26.549 --> 38:29.551
We have lockdown.
That's a lockdown.

38:29.619 --> 38:31.887
Cell check!
Against the wall!

38:31.955 --> 38:33.389
Against the wall! Hustle!
Everyone against the wall!

38:33.456 --> 38:34.990
Hustle! Hustle!

38:35.058 --> 38:36.525
Toss this cell.

38:36.593 --> 38:39.161
Against the wall.
Against the wall.

38:39.229 --> 38:40.763
Toss them real good,
gentlemen.

38:48.304 --> 38:49.705
Found a weapon.

38:54.210 --> 38:55.377
Oh, you bitch!

38:55.445 --> 38:56.478
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

38:59.816 --> 39:02.084
Relax.

39:04.621 --> 39:07.256
You bitch!

39:25.141 --> 39:26.742
Glad you made it,
criminal.

39:26.810 --> 39:28.644
Your people
took their sweet time

39:28.711 --> 39:30.045
with my delivery.

39:30.113 --> 39:33.148
And what were they delivering,
exactly?

39:33.216 --> 39:36.251
It must have been important
to be worth losing your stash.

39:36.319 --> 39:37.519
It was.

39:42.992 --> 39:44.726
You know, I've been thinking
about that damn package

39:44.794 --> 39:46.128
for the last 24 hours.

39:46.196 --> 39:48.030
The least you could do
is tell me what was in it.

39:55.839 --> 39:58.807
This was my mother's.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.043
It's beautiful.

40:02.946 --> 40:05.547
She died
while I was in here.

40:05.615 --> 40:07.783
Only person
who ever really loved me,

40:07.851 --> 40:09.985
and I couldn't even
go to her funeral.

40:10.053 --> 40:12.120
This is all she had
to leave me.

40:12.188 --> 40:15.190
They gave it to Eddie since
we never got a real divorce.

40:15.258 --> 40:16.458
He wouldn't
give it to me.

40:16.526 --> 40:18.861
Blames me
for his brother dying.

40:18.928 --> 40:21.964
Why?

40:22.031 --> 40:24.132
Because I shot him.

40:27.937 --> 40:31.607
I have one more question
for you.

40:31.674 --> 40:34.476
Sorry. You're way past
your quota for the day.

40:34.544 --> 40:36.778
You said that the box
had to arrive

40:36.846 --> 40:38.313
before the 9:00 a.m.
shift change.

40:38.381 --> 40:39.948
There's no way
it got here in time.

40:40.016 --> 40:42.551
Maybe it did.

40:42.619 --> 40:44.953
Or maybe I thought
I'd see if I remember

40:45.021 --> 40:47.256
what trust feels like.

40:55.698 --> 41:00.802
You guys wanted
the impossible task, you got it.

41:00.870 --> 41:03.505
This photo
was taken six months ago.

41:03.573 --> 41:05.974
It's my brother, Trent.
You have to find him.

41:06.042 --> 41:09.144
And you can't tell the CIA
about any of this

41:09.212 --> 41:11.280
because they're not
my biggest fans.

41:11.347 --> 41:13.715
All righty.

41:13.783 --> 41:15.384
A little game
of global manhunt.

41:15.451 --> 41:17.653
Let's get started.
Who took the photo?

41:17.720 --> 41:20.122
No idea.
Anson sent it to me.

41:20.189 --> 41:22.524
He sent me
all these photos.

41:22.592 --> 41:25.060
Trent lived in Miami
until three years ago,

41:25.128 --> 41:27.262
and then he had to
go off the grid.

41:27.330 --> 41:29.898
And only that bastard Anson
knows where he is.

41:29.966 --> 41:33.802
I have tried every possible way
of tracking him down,

41:33.870 --> 41:36.705
but if Anson even so much
as sees me looking,

41:36.773 --> 41:38.941
Trent's dead.

41:39.008 --> 41:41.243
We'll find your brother.

41:43.513 --> 41:44.813
You better.
