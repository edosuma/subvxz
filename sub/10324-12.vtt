- Hey, Earl.
- Hey, Crabman.

00:18.284 --> 00:21.185
Think there's something wrong
with these books.

00:21.287 --> 00:25.189
Oh, the Camden Library couldn't afford
actual classics, so they bought knockoffs.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.456
I just opened up the window
and gave the plants a choice.

Did you open the bathroom door
and give the tub a choice, or are you just crazy?

02:13.666 --> 02:18.000
I'll tell you what is crazy is lettin' somebody
tell you where you can put your tub.
