00:10.218 --> 00:11.845
<i>Remember Helen Who?</i>

00:11.928 --> 00:13.763
<i>She's dead. Sad face.</i>

00:14.806 --> 00:17.434
<i>But Erika Vu is alive and thriving.</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:19.144
<i>#Living!</i>

00:19.227 --> 00:22.856
<i>Erika Vu is a legend. I heard</i>
<i>she was Timothée Chalamet's first kiss.</i>

00:22.939 --> 00:23.940
<i> #Yaasss.</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:27.235
<i>I heard she got them to retire</i>
<i>the name "Erika" from the hurricane list.</i>

00:27.318 --> 00:31.072
<i>Erika Vu was given the key to the city</i>
<i>in three cities she doesn't even live in.</i>

00:31.156 --> 00:32.365
Time to step it up.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.910
<i>Oh my God!</i>
<i>Erika Vu's making a TikTok in the hallway!</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:50.216
-Love the new TikTok.
-Thanks, bitch.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.639
-Meet you in the quad, bitch.
-Don't keep me waiting, bitch.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.861
-WTFKA Twigs is going on with you?

01:09.944 --> 01:11.488
You have barely talked to me

01:11.571 --> 01:14.032
for the past five days
since you bitch-ditched me.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.575
As in left me in a ditch in the woods

01:15.658 --> 01:18.495
and used family dinner as an excuse
to hang out with that bitch Riley.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.080
I did do family dinner.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.916
It was cut short because Riley
really needed someone to talk to.

01:22.999 --> 01:26.086
-'Cause She's going through a breakup.
-Yeah, with the guy you're dating!

01:26.169 --> 01:28.463
Gia, I'm allowed to have
more than one close friend.

01:29.672 --> 01:33.718
I actually have 98,000!

01:33.802 --> 01:36.221
Sorry. I didn't realize
you were drinking your own haterade.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.598
This is a matcha latte with ashwagandha.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.101
You hate matcha lattes.
And why are you talking like that?

01:41.184 --> 01:43.394
It's been five days.
It's like you're a different person.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.606
I'm evolving. And I'm dead.
I don't have a lot of time.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.984
And as my close friend,
you should allow me to grow

01:50.068 --> 01:51.236
my following.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.531
Matcha lattes
have great engagement.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.074
You're posting from the afterlife?

01:56.157 --> 01:57.450
Why are you being so hostile?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.994
You could use some adaptogens.
Want the rest of my matcha?

02:01.037 --> 02:04.290
Okay. Well, can you throw it out for me?
'Cause you're closer.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.796
Look. I am saying this out of love,

02:09.879 --> 02:13.049
even though I am…
I am holding your freaking trash.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.262
You need to be careful.
Power's only good if you don't abuse it.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.264
I'm feeling very attacked right now.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.058
Text me when you've calmed down
'cause your aura is mega red.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.329
Will you give me another chance?

02:58.553 --> 03:00.972
-Caught you! Wanna go make out?
-Yeah, yeah.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.390
-First, I have a question.
-Yeah?

03:02.473 --> 03:04.225
What's going on with you and Riley?

03:04.309 --> 03:07.061
I wanted to make things right
after you called me out for being rude.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.647
Which I'm grateful for, by the way.
You keep me grounded.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.775
Anyways, Riley and I getting along so well
was just the icing on the cake.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.277
And you love cake.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.070
I… Yeah, I guess, yeah.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.782
If it's not what you want, I guess I could
go back to hating her and icing her out.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.951
Of course I don't want, like, that.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.120
It's just… It's a little weird.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.540
Well, if it's weird,
then maybe I should just dump her.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.585
Huh? What? No, no. Okay, like…
It's not that weird. It's just…

03:31.586 --> 03:32.712
Let's just all be friends.

03:32.795 --> 03:33.755
We can all be friends.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.049
-If that's what you want.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.093
-How you gonna make it up to me?
-Uh… I don't know.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.972
-Maybe we can just hang tonight?
-It's a date.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.109
What's your problem?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.695
-I was just…
-Oh, get over it, pussy.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.906
I had a human moment
that I just didn't want to claim.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.242
I tried to make it right,
but you wouldn't accept it.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.952
So now, all I can do is let it go.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.954
Just shut up and finish your tests.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.122
Test? I didn't study for a test.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.042
-It's not my problem.
-Isn't it, though?

04:11.125 --> 04:13.294
Jerry, we know that you grade on a curve.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.588
So what happens if there is no curve.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.966
-And we all just do this?

04:19.467 --> 04:21.386
Guys, what do you think
about it?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.096
I think you have detention.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.139
I think I don't.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.558
Guys. He can't give us all detention.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.186
Rip it.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.025
I wouldn't do… Okay, you did.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.277
Rip it, Stinky.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.199
Wait. No, no, no, no.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.159
No, wait, wait, wait. No, come on.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.582
You're a saint for walking with me.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.877
And I'm an idiot
for getting too high to drive.

04:54.961 --> 04:55.920
Why are you high at all?

04:56.004 --> 04:58.256
You know when you like something
so much it's intoxicating,

04:58.339 --> 05:00.675
and you lose control
over whatever you're saying or doing?

05:03.094 --> 05:04.012
It's you.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.556
You have this power over me. It's hot.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.224
No. Really?

05:08.975 --> 05:11.728
Then why did I overhear you tell Raven
we didn't hook up at my party?

05:11.811 --> 05:14.647
This isn't a sidepiece sitch, is it?
I'm a main piece… a corner piece.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.607
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, no, no.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.735
Yeah, you're the main piece
and the corner piece.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.737
-But Raven and I are not a thing.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.906
Is that why you ignored,
like, 80 of my texts?

05:23.990 --> 05:27.577
And also, I was worried
Brad would steal you. Women love him.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.121
Really? First of all, I am my own woman,
and I can't be stolen.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.665
And Brad is so cheesy.
I don't get, like, his stupid fake magic.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.375
Yeah, right? He thinks he's hot shit

05:34.459 --> 05:36.461
just 'cause he's
the go-to bar mitzvah magician.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.463
How would he possibly handle
a woman like me

05:38.546 --> 05:39.881
if he can't handle his own doves?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.299
Well, no. It is a lot of doves.

05:41.382 --> 05:42.592
I mean, they're easy to train,

05:42.675 --> 05:45.553
but then you get into the molting
and the regurgitating and…

05:50.516 --> 05:51.768
Dove talk over.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.065
I can't decide which bags
I wanna keep or take back.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.776
-No rush. Take your time. Just chew on it.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.569
Your dad's mad
you haven't returned his call.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.988
-Should I text him back the ush?
-Whatever.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.909
"Aura update. White hot."

06:07.992 --> 06:11.788
"Gavin and I made up and made out.
Hope you're having fun with the enemy."

06:11.871 --> 06:13.539
"Give Lea a hug for me…"

06:13.623 --> 06:14.916
Shout-out!

06:14.999 --> 06:18.878
"…and some self-respect,
'cause clearly she doesn't have any,

06:18.961 --> 06:21.464
or she wouldn't let Riley
use her as a doormat"?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.466
Who even is "Ghia' anyway?

06:23.549 --> 06:26.386
Nobody. She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.347
-Clearly.
-Sorry to interrupt.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.766
I just wanted to bring you girls
a tasty drink.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.393
Thank you!

06:33.476 --> 06:34.936
-,Now go away, Karen.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.231
-Mm.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.984
-Ugh. My stepmom is such a kiss-ass.
-Photo op!

06:42.068 --> 06:43.027
Okay.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.030
Mm.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.907
Okay. One second.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.284
-So cute.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.037
Oh my gosh. Stunning.
Oh, yeah. No, I love it.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.248
Yes. Oh my God, give me everything.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.374
Can we take one of just me?

06:56.457 --> 06:58.167
And can you move the wilted flowers?

06:58.668 --> 07:00.711
They're dead?
Oh my God, I hate dead things.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.338
-So gross.
-Ugh.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.968
Well, not all dead things are gross.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.429
I mean, like cows.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.181
Hamburgers are good.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.811
Uh, do you guys ever think
about what happens after?

07:16.894 --> 07:17.812
To the cows?

07:17.895 --> 07:22.191
No. Like… like when we graduate,
and we move on to the next phase.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.485
You know, and… and we're hanging out
with new people.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.404
People who aren't… people.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.281
They're other things.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.783
What other things
would we be hanging out with?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.410
You know, uh…

07:32.493 --> 07:35.413
When we start over, and we're not
nearly as popular anymore.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.082
I'm always gonna be popular.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.460
-How do you know that?
-I just do.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.879
Oh. But how do you sustain that?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.380
By any means possible.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.424
Oh.

07:49.385 --> 07:53.181
-It's so nice hanging out with you.
-Yeah, it's… it's nice to be alone.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.224
Ish.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.980
Thank you for being cool
with me chilling until my date.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.735
Not a prob.
Nothing more chill than… than this.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.404
I need a fork.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.035
Isn't this so nice?
All of us being friends?

08:14.118 --> 08:17.455
Sure. But maybe just not on a date.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.791
You're right. I'm gonna make her feel bad
and weird. And I'll ask her to leave.

08:20.875 --> 08:24.295
No, I… I just thought
it was gonna be just you and me.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.172
Do you guys want me to go?

08:26.255 --> 08:27.173
No!

08:27.256 --> 08:29.675
Because Jake L… rainchecked.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.011
Rude! Does "L" stand for "Loser"?

08:33.304 --> 08:35.556
Hi! Can we get some new fries?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.391
We stopped eating them, and they got cold.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.559
Oh my God!

08:38.643 --> 08:41.354
I love you guys! Hate you. Love you.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.563
You, I don't know.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.107
Oh, I'm not online.
I'm more of a… a private person.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.859
Weird. Can you take our pic?

08:47.443 --> 08:48.402
Sure.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.155
Ooh! Pretend to be fighting.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.623
-So…

09:02.416 --> 09:03.459
That's cool, babe.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.796
I didn't say anything.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.051
Can you stop texting so we can talk?

09:12.134 --> 09:13.052
Totally.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.266
-Now you're texting each other?

09:20.142 --> 09:21.143
-Stop.
-Yes.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.021
-You gonna answer those?

09:24.105 --> 09:27.483
Uh, no. They want me to follow up on
the ghostly presence I felt at your party.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.444
You know, I get that I'm the medium
and the emotional glue of the group,

09:30.528 --> 09:33.489
but it's like…
"Can't I have one night to myself?"

09:34.532 --> 09:36.117
Are you feeling anything?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.953
Besides, uh, greatness?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.087
What's wrong? Am I bumming you out?

09:48.170 --> 09:51.090
-Brad says I do that to people.
-No, no, no. It's not you.

09:51.173 --> 09:54.385
I, uh… I'm just
in my feelings about something else.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.679
Uh, someone else.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.265
What would you do
if you created a monster?

09:59.348 --> 10:03.686
I actually have. Sophomore year, I created
a servitor to help me write my paper,

10:03.769 --> 10:06.105
but then my, uh…
my servitor came after me.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.983
A real Frankenstein's monster situation.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.777
Oh, you mean Erika.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.114
The power of best friends
is that you can always patch things up.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.617
No matter how weird
and annoying they're being.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.535
Yeah, I dunno. It might be too late.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.331
-The friend is using a weird fake voice.
-You think that's Brad's real voice?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.543
Best friends don't give up
on best friends.

10:28.919 --> 10:33.466
Even when they have to swallow their pride
and be… the better best friend.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.676
The real Erika's in there.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.511
You just have to find her.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.020
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.063
Bye, girl.

10:53.110 --> 10:56.739
Hey, am I seeing things,
or were you out with Jake C and Riley?

10:56.822 --> 10:59.283
-Yeah, so?
-I don't know. It's a little bit weird.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.285
You lying in wait in my bushes is weird.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.372
-Come to yell at me again?
-No. I… I come in peace.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.708
-Out of love.
-I really felt the love for me today.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.709
Hey, look.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.379
Look, I'm… I'm really sorry.
I get that you're on edge right now.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.548
You just found out you're dead,
and that's, like… a hard thing to process.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.551
But it's me, you know,
your best friend of a decade.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.846
Can't we just talk for real?

11:20.930 --> 11:21.889
We're talking.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.646
I… I didn't realize how much time
it would take to leave a legacy.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.774
You know, time that you wouldn't
be able to spend with me.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.735
I… I really miss you.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.780
Can't we just put aside the petty bullshit

11:37.863 --> 11:41.200
and just be us
for the handful of days we have left?

11:41.283 --> 11:42.993
Prom is in a week, and then

11:43.619 --> 11:44.495
that's it.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.206
We're running out of time.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.377
Oh my gosh, Gia. You're right.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.171
I don't have time.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.342
I need an extension!

11:59.135 --> 12:01.846
I mean, the ghost that I know
needs an extension.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.014
Uh, yeah, we can definitely
help with that.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.559
Um, but first, I need some info
about your friend.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.978
-What?
-Uh, promposal ideas.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.773
-Whoa! Who're you going to prom with?
-I'm trying to have a conversation.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.025
I can tell you're trying,
but desperation's not a tactic.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.278
You need to give her
the telepathic stare-down.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.280
Tell her how you feel without

12:20.072 --> 12:20.906
saying it.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.450
-I don't need your help.
-Yes, you do.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.492
-Not right now.
-Okay.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.162
Sorry, sorry. Um, so,
what is Gia's dream promposal?

12:26.245 --> 12:27.496
No idea.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.082
Seems like something
best friends would know, but whatever.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.501
I'm trying to get ideas,
and you know her better than I do.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.295
So… Um, What's her favorite flower?

12:34.378 --> 12:38.007
Is she more of a big public gesture
kind of girl or more private?

12:38.090 --> 12:41.218
Would a flash mob be considered cheesy?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.928
Why don't you just text her?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.722
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.016
I guess texting is
kind of our thing.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.643
Okay. Yeah, I'll work on a draft
right now.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.145
Liquid courage.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.606
Okay. Back to me.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.984
So, what if a ghost doesn't wanna finish
its unfinished business

12:57.067 --> 12:59.612
and, you know, wants to stay embodied for…

13:00.154 --> 13:03.324
I dunno. 60… …70 years?

13:03.407 --> 13:04.784
Or maybe even just like a month.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.995
Um, are there any, uh,
tricks or loopholes?

13:08.078 --> 13:09.371
Sure. A couple.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.749
Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson
stayed embodied

13:11.832 --> 13:13.793
because they became famous posthumously.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.378
Their spirits were stronger in death
than they were in life.

13:16.462 --> 13:20.633
Done. The ghost that I know is way more
famous now than when it was alive, so…

13:20.716 --> 13:22.676
And what about the bodies?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.346
-Were they put to rest?
-Uh-uh.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.431
-How do you know?
-We just do.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.183
Edgar's actually my uncle's roommate.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.018
-Any more loopholes?
-Marilyn Monroe.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.063
Her UFB was to marry JFK, but…

13:34.146 --> 13:37.274
Okay, I get it. It was her fame.
Bigger in death than in life.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.819
Then a ghost can stall its UFB.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.903
Or cancel it.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.154
Cool. Thank you.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.324
-Hey, uh, can you help me? Texter's block.
-No time.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.743
-Right. Prom assembly's about to start.
-Is that today?

13:48.786 --> 13:49.912
Uh, right now.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.166
Shit! I have to cancel it.
Prom can't happen!

13:54.250 --> 13:57.127
As your student body president
slash prom committee chair,

13:57.211 --> 14:00.756
it is my honor
to introduce our prom theme.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.842
This has been nine months in the making.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.010
So, hopefully, you don't mind
waiting a little longer

14:05.094 --> 14:07.096
-as I give a few thank-yous.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.350
I'd like to thank Meredith,
who stayed up six nights in a row

14:11.433 --> 14:13.561
making these amazing paper roses.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.647
I'd also like to thank the Potts family
for donating the costumes

14:16.730 --> 14:18.607
from their own personal collection.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.194
And now for the big reveal.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.823
-Drumroll, please!

14:38.586 --> 14:40.212
This is bullshit!

14:42.590 --> 14:44.341
Prom is bullshit.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.427
It's lame and it's cheesy.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.847
And everyone has such high expectations,
they're guaranteed to be disappointed.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.766
It's also problematic.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.185
It's promblematic.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.568
Prom lifts up
the haves and the hots,

15:02.651 --> 15:04.653
but completely disempowers
the have-nots, okay?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.156
It is classist, and sexist, and

15:07.656 --> 15:08.824
ageist.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.243
I'm 16.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.246
Only high schoolers get to go to prom.
That's exclusionary.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.540
Don't even get me started
about what happens after prom.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.459
Alcohol poisoning, drunk driving,

15:18.542 --> 15:20.502
drive-through diarrhea. Prom kills!

15:20.586 --> 15:23.380
Are you okay, Erika?
It seems like you're going mad.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.466
I am going mad, Emma.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.926
I'm mad for a girl

15:27.593 --> 15:28.886
named Alice.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.513
Hmpf.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.433
A girl that just
wanted to take a nap,

15:34.516 --> 15:36.310
which I feel like we can all relate to,

15:36.393 --> 15:39.647
but instead,
she goes down the rabbit hole.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.774
Yeah, AKA kidnapping.

15:41.857 --> 15:46.445
Then she gets roofied, gaslit, and forced
to wear tights and patent leather shoes.

15:46.528 --> 15:50.199
-Which I don't even want to talk about.
-Not to mention the themes of colonialism.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.534
-Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Huang.
-Right.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.078
And then there's the body shaming.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.788
First,

15:55.871 --> 15:57.081
she's too big.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.626
Then, she is too small.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.795
And we all know what the cat represents.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.130
-A vagina.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.092
Forced to be deflowered
on prom night, okay?

16:08.175 --> 16:10.427
-What's up with that?
-It's pagan bullcrap!

16:10.511 --> 16:14.098
Yes. So what about
instead of screwing after prom,

16:14.181 --> 16:15.849
we just skip it,

16:15.933 --> 16:17.726
and we just say, "Screw prom"?

16:19.061 --> 16:20.854
Let's effing go!

16:20.938 --> 16:22.815
Uh… No, no, no. Let's not go.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.193
Jake C, will you not not not
go to prom with me?

16:26.276 --> 16:28.529
-Come on, Jake!
-Um…

16:28.612 --> 16:30.739
-Come on, bro!
-Yeah, tell her!

16:30.823 --> 16:31.699
Mm-hm.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.658
Okay, great!

16:32.741 --> 16:36.412
Yay! So if I'm not gonna go,
and you're not gonna go,

16:36.495 --> 16:38.539
then maybe we should just cancel it.

16:38.622 --> 16:39.665
Cancel it!

16:39.748 --> 16:41.792
Yes! Let's cancel prom.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.252
Cancel prom!

16:43.335 --> 16:44.962
-Cancel prom!
- Cancel prom!

16:45.045 --> 16:48.007
Cancel prom!

16:52.136 --> 16:54.471
Let's tear it down!

17:00.310 --> 17:03.731
No!

17:26.712 --> 17:28.380
-Erika!

17:31.842 --> 17:34.136
You… You can't.
You can't just cancel prom.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.055
Don't you understand?
You're not gonna ascend.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.390
-It's fine. I found a loophole.
-What loophole?

17:38.474 --> 17:41.310
I can stick around
if I'm more famous in death than in life.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.604
There is no prom,
so there is no business to finish.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.564
Bullshit. This is gonna
bite you in the ass.

17:45.647 --> 17:46.899
Hey. Don't worry about me.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.276
Well, you're ruining prom
for everyone else, including me.

17:49.359 --> 17:52.112
Do you even care about anyone
or anything other than you?

17:52.196 --> 17:54.073
Like, I don't know…
Maybe your rotting corpse?

17:54.156 --> 17:56.283
I haven't been there a week,
and nothing's happened.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.328
Yeah, because I've been Postmates-ing ice
to the road by the woods every day!

17:59.411 --> 18:02.081
-I didn't ask you to.
-What you gonna do when somebody finds it?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.750
-How you gonna stop them?
-By any means possible.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.418
Well, I… I am gonna take your body

18:06.502 --> 18:08.295
and I'm gonna drag it
to the middle of the road

18:08.378 --> 18:10.214
in the center of town
so everybody finds you.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.257
That moose weighs 1,000 pounds.
You can't move it!

18:12.341 --> 18:15.761
-Her name is Shelley, and watch me!
-Over my dead--

18:15.844 --> 18:17.638
-What the hell was that?
-Can we discuss later?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.973
Not only did you totally
180 me on prom again,

18:20.057 --> 18:22.142
but you put me on the spot
in a very public way.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.352
You said it was okay.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.604
Because there were
100 people screaming at me.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.273
I'm sorry.
I'm sure this was so, so hard for you.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.943
And I would love to address this.
In private, of course.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.694
But I've way bigger things
to deal with now

18:32.778 --> 18:34.571
than you being a whiny little bitch.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.421
-Move it or lose it, freaks!
-We need to talk.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.508
Your ghost,
it's someone close to you, right?

18:54.591 --> 18:58.053
When you said it's personal,
did you mean, like, really personal?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.805
Yes, I meant personal.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.641
And personal also means private.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.602
So, if you don't wanna become a ghost too,
frickin' move!

19:10.399 --> 19:12.568
-Oh, no, you don't!

19:13.777 --> 19:14.611
Gia!

19:16.780 --> 19:17.906
Leg cramp.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.325
Dead leg. Dead dead leg.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.910
Get out of the way, Gia!

19:24.538 --> 19:26.665
This isn't fair.
You have a lower center of gravity!

19:26.748 --> 19:28.834
"I'm Erika. My life totally sucks."

19:28.917 --> 19:31.712
"My boyfriend is too hot.
My bully is too nice."

19:31.795 --> 19:33.130
"My parents are too supportive."

19:33.213 --> 19:34.798
"My best friend isn't supportive enough."

19:34.882 --> 19:36.925
-I'm dead!
-Your point?

19:37.009 --> 19:40.429
At least you have the option to live
a life that sucks! I would die for that!

19:40.512 --> 19:42.472
I mean… You know what I mean!

19:45.934 --> 19:48.395
This is so gross!

19:55.027 --> 19:57.279
-Get off me, bitch!
-I'm not a bitch!

19:58.864 --> 20:00.240
Takes one to make one!

20:00.324 --> 20:04.578
Well, I'm sorry that I forced you out
of your woe-is-me sad loser comfort zone

20:04.661 --> 20:06.955
just so you could actually have some fun!
My bad.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.416
And I wasn't the one
who turned you into the exact person

20:09.499 --> 20:11.335
that made you so sad in the first place!

20:11.418 --> 20:13.253
Just admit
you're jealous of Riley!

20:13.337 --> 20:14.963
I am not talking about Riley.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.924
I'm talking about you!
This was all you, babe!

20:17.007 --> 20:20.427
Then I guess you're a bitch by association
'cause you could never be a real bitch!

20:20.510 --> 20:22.179
-'Cause you don't have the guts!

20:26.975 --> 20:28.060
Oh, yeah?

20:31.897 --> 20:35.442
Hey, guys. We've all been begging Erika
to drop the skin-care routine.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.568
So here it is.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.029
Blood, moose juice, corpse shavings.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.865
And, of course, a healthy diet of maggots.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.784
-#Ad, #Influencer.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.245
-#GoingDown!

20:46.328 --> 20:47.746
Oh, you bitch.
